00:09.451 --> 00:10.853
Let me tell you a story.

00:12.521 --> 00:14.624
In 1855,

00:15.290 --> 00:17.326
at La FlÃ©tan AgÃ©,

00:17.359 --> 00:19.194
a small theatre in Paris,

00:19.662 --> 00:24.801
I attended an evening of staged
magic and conjuring.

00:26.201 --> 00:31.506
The magician performed all the requisite
illusions precisely as one would expect...

00:32.207 --> 00:33.743
And for an encore,

00:33.776 --> 00:38.480
he placed his lovely assistant
into a long box,

00:38.513 --> 00:40.148
mesmerized her,

00:40.783 --> 00:43.185
and
proceeded to saw her in half.

00:44.453 --> 00:47.624
He took his bow, the
curtain closed.

00:49.358 --> 00:51.828
The magician left the country
the next day

00:52.561 --> 00:56.599
and the young woman, whom I
later learned was his mistress,

00:56.633 --> 00:58.533
was never heard from again.

00:59.769 --> 01:04.807
I can say now that I, along with
some 200 others,

01:05.775 --> 01:10.479
may have bore witness to the
murder of that woman.

01:11.614 --> 01:13.448
The deed, of course, was
shrouded

01:13.482 --> 01:19.454
in a haze of misdirection and
spectacle filtered lighting, smoke,

01:19.488 --> 01:22.524
so it required no concerted
effort

01:22.557 --> 01:27.229
to persuade us all that
it was indeed an illusion.

01:28.263 --> 01:31.366
When one encounters a magician,

01:31.834 --> 01:35.437
one expects, invites trickery

01:36.304 --> 01:37.874
all the while knowing

01:38.540 --> 01:42.177
that the simplest way to saw a
woman in half

01:43.646 --> 01:47.249
is to simply saw a
woman in half.

01:51.020 --> 01:55.591
That story has something to do
with this situation, doesn't it?

01:55.625 --> 01:56.893
It does.

01:57.894 --> 02:00.897
It's pretty cryptic. I don't
get the connection.

02:01.664 --> 02:02.531
You will.

03:18.641 --> 03:20.076
<i>Well, it's a forest...</i>

03:20.109 --> 03:23.545
<i>...but it's an animated forest,
like in those puppet holiday shows:</i>

03:23.579 --> 03:26.314
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer <i>or</i>
Nestor, the Long-Eared Donkey...

03:26.348 --> 03:27.617
<i>I'm not familiar with</i> Nestor

03:27.650 --> 03:29.417
<i>So I'm walking along
with two elves.</i>

03:29.451 --> 03:31.821
<i>And we come to this clearing
in the woods.</i>

03:31.854 --> 03:34.657
<i>And there's this Christmas tree
lying in the snow. It fell over.</i>

03:34.690 --> 03:38.961
<i>So we start towards the tree and a bear
starts chasing us and grabs the two elves.</i>

03:38.995 --> 03:41.631
<i>And I see them get dragged
into the forest.</i>

03:41.664 --> 03:44.634
<i>I turn back around and there's
a phonograph record in the snow.</i>

03:44.667 --> 03:45.735
<i>So I pick it up.</i>

03:45.768 --> 03:46.869
<i>What was the record?</i>

03:46.903 --> 03:47.770
<i>No idea.</i>

03:47.804 --> 03:49.772
<i>Then a wolf comes out of the
woods</i>

03:49.806 --> 03:52.507
<i>and he grabs the phonograph
record and he's pulling on it.</i>

03:52.541 --> 03:56.344
<i>I realize that I can't make it
to the tree with this wolf here</i>

03:56.378 --> 03:58.648
<i>so I fling the record into the
woods and the wolf chases it.</i>

03:58.681 --> 03:59.649
<i>Now he's gone,</i>

03:59.682 --> 04:01.383
<i>and I turn back
around towards the tree</i>

04:01.416 --> 04:07.355
<i>and there's another elf there trying to lift
it up, a really tall elf, way taller than me.</i>

04:07.389 --> 04:10.593
- <i>He's trying to lift it up...</i>
- <i>Wait, taller than you? How do you know he was an elf?</i>

04:10.626 --> 04:13.095
<i>Well, he was dressed
funny, like an elf.</i>

04:13.129 --> 04:14.664
<i>You know, colorful?</i>

04:14.697 --> 04:16.632
<i>Anyway, the tree's too heavy for
him,</i>

04:16.666 --> 04:20.036
<i>so I go over and help him and we
finally manage to set it up straight.</i>

04:20.069 --> 04:24.439
<i>And then we stare at each
other really intense-like.</i>

04:25.608 --> 04:26.876
<i>What happened after that?</i>

04:27.743 --> 04:28.678
I woke up.

04:29.979 --> 04:30.880
So what do you think?

04:31.747 --> 04:33.916
Hard to say.
It's not normal, though.

04:34.617 --> 04:36.351
You're probably a lunatic.

04:36.953 --> 04:39.088
- A dozen mixed, please?
- You got it.

04:40.089 --> 04:43.860
It's too weird and specific not
to mean something, Meg.

04:43.893 --> 04:45.427
I mean, what's with the tree?

04:45.460 --> 04:47.562
Well, I know what a
psychiatrist would say:

04:47.597 --> 04:50.900
Having trouble making a tree standing
up, probably a penis thing.

04:50.933 --> 04:53.135
Don't be gross.
I don't have a penis thing.

04:54.770 --> 04:56.138
No plain glazed, please.

04:57.539 --> 05:00.576
- No problem.
- "No plain glazed?" Seriously?

05:00.610 --> 05:01.844
I don't care for it.

05:01.878 --> 05:04.747
It's the saddest donut
in the case.

05:04.780 --> 05:06.782
The mixed dozen is built
around the plain glazed.

05:06.816 --> 05:08.951
It grounds it. But, hey!
It's your funeral.

05:09.652 --> 05:11.754
Hey, did anybody find a wallet?

05:11.787 --> 05:14.090
I left it on that table
a half an hour ago...

05:14.123 --> 05:16.125
No. I don't think anyone
turned anything in.

05:19.795 --> 05:20.930
I'll go check in the back...

05:39.582 --> 05:41.050
- This it?
- That's it!

05:41.083 --> 05:42.919
Somebody must have turned it in.

05:46.856 --> 05:49.926
Thanks. I appreciate it.

05:52.028 --> 05:53.930
Ruth, aren't you supposed
to be there at two?

05:54.664 --> 05:55.765
Shit.

05:55.798 --> 05:57.934
Good luck with the penis thing!

06:05.174 --> 06:06.609
Damn doctors.

06:07.743 --> 06:08.678
Idiots.

06:11.013 --> 06:13.683
If I'm not dying according to
their schedule

06:14.150 --> 06:17.753
then maybe it's their damn schedule
that's out of whack, not me!

06:17.787 --> 06:19.155
Making them look bad.

06:20.656 --> 06:22.490
They ran some new tests.

06:22.524 --> 06:23.558
Yeah?

06:23.592 --> 06:24.727
Came back good.

06:26.195 --> 06:29.832
Dr. Zeblisky, he
danced around it.

06:30.565 --> 06:35.905
But I got the impression they were thinking
of maybe kicking me out of this dump.

06:35.938 --> 06:37.974
What? Zeblisky actually
said that?

06:38.007 --> 06:39.842
That's great news, Dad...

06:39.875 --> 06:41.543
Well, he danced around it...

06:41.577 --> 06:43.179
But still, for him to
say that, that's...

06:43.212 --> 06:46.248
Look, I don't want to talk about
it. I don't want to jinx it.

06:49.986 --> 06:53.022
So... how's work?

06:53.055 --> 06:54.957
Oh, work's good.

06:54.991 --> 06:56.092
Still a grind.

06:56.125 --> 06:58.526
I should hear about that
promotion in a couple of weeks.

06:58.560 --> 07:01.163
That executive account position?

07:01.197 --> 07:03.733
Yup. Corner office,
fifteenth floor.

07:03.766 --> 07:05.067
Imagine that...

07:06.135 --> 07:09.238
I never saw you making
more than minimum wage.

07:12.908 --> 07:15.311
How about that little
Kyle there, huh?

07:15.344 --> 07:20.249
It's only been a month and
already he's bigger and stronger.

07:20.282 --> 07:21.817
Hair's growing, too.

07:21.851 --> 07:23.819
He's good Kiesling stock.

07:23.853 --> 07:26.055
Yup, he's quite a handful.

07:26.088 --> 07:29.125
And I hate to keep bringing it
up,

07:29.925 --> 07:32.695
but when you and Grant get
married, he's agreed to...

07:32.728 --> 07:35.765
Yes, Dad. Kyle will keep the Kiesling name.
We've already been through this.

07:35.798 --> 07:40.102
I know it's not important to you,
but it's a hell of a thing he's doing.

07:40.136 --> 07:46.142
And I'll be sure to tell him that when
I finally get a chance to meet him.

07:47.843 --> 07:51.113
How you managed to land a guy
like that

07:51.947 --> 07:54.683
is I'll never be able
to figure that out.

08:00.856 --> 08:03.092
- Did it go okay? How's your dad?
- Alright.

08:03.125 --> 08:04.627
He's actually doing better.

08:04.660 --> 08:06.328
Doing better? Really?

08:08.030 --> 08:10.032
Let's get you home
to Mama, Jeffrey.

08:10.866 --> 08:12.635
- How did the little guy do?
- Just fine.

08:12.668 --> 08:14.103
You got a good kid, Brock.

08:28.050 --> 08:29.718
- Okay.
- Wait.

08:31.420 --> 08:32.354
Okay.

08:43.032 --> 08:44.232
- Time.
- Okay.

08:47.336 --> 08:48.838
See you next Thursday.

08:48.871 --> 08:51.774
- Oh, yeah about that...
- What?

08:51.807 --> 08:55.811
Lori's taking Jeffrey to her parents'
house in Iowa for a couple of weeks,

08:55.845 --> 08:58.280
so it kind of throws a monkey
wrench in my visitation schedule.

08:58.314 --> 08:59.882
You're telling me this now?

09:00.683 --> 09:02.852
You can get Lois' kid
again, can't you?

09:02.885 --> 09:05.654
I think my dad's starting to be
able to tell the difference.

09:05.688 --> 09:06.822
Shit, Brock.

09:08.390 --> 09:11.393
I'm not crazy about it either, Ruth,
but this custody thing's all about her.

09:11.427 --> 09:15.431
And you gotta admit this hospice thing has
been going on way longer than you told me.

09:15.464 --> 09:17.233
I know, I know.

09:18.767 --> 09:19.635
Shit.

09:20.803 --> 09:25.207
Hey, you want to get a
coffee or a cheese crisp?

09:26.008 --> 09:27.009
I know a guy.

09:28.310 --> 09:29.178
Nah.

09:29.879 --> 09:32.014
I got an interview downtown.

09:32.047 --> 09:33.349
Job interview?

09:33.382 --> 09:34.783
Something like that.

09:35.451 --> 09:37.119
Everything go okay this week?

09:37.853 --> 09:39.155
Any episodes?

09:39.188 --> 09:40.756
Confrontations?

09:40.789 --> 09:42.158
No. No. Pretty good week.

09:44.093 --> 09:47.997
Small confrontation with a guy
driving too slow in the left lane.

09:48.030 --> 09:50.933
Threw half a breakfast burrito at
him when we stopped at a light.

09:50.966 --> 09:53.869
- Jeez, Ruth...
- Oh, come on, Crosby. The guy was about fifty.

09:53.903 --> 09:58.140
How do you drive for thirty years and
not know the left lane is the fast lane?

09:58.174 --> 10:00.943
That kind of jug head ignorance
deserves a breakfast burrito.

10:00.976 --> 10:01.911
I'll let it go.

10:03.179 --> 10:05.114
How about your work?
You missing any time from your work?

10:05.147 --> 10:07.383
No, no, work's fine.
Donuts aren't real challenging...

10:07.416 --> 10:09.251
But it pays the bills.

10:09.285 --> 10:10.786
I wouldn't go that far.

10:11.854 --> 10:13.989
- Did your boss fill out that paperwork?
- Oh.

10:16.292 --> 10:18.227
Oh, shit I left it at home.

10:18.260 --> 10:20.729
But I do have my community
service hours.

10:20.763 --> 10:22.731
You're gonna need to
bring it by tomorrow.

10:22.765 --> 10:24.266
Without fail, please.

10:25.467 --> 10:27.169
The ventriloquist thing again?

10:27.937 --> 10:30.039
I can't just keep letting
this slide, Ruth.

10:30.072 --> 10:32.875
- Why not?
- Because it's not community service.

10:32.908 --> 10:34.910
It's meant to amuse
and entertain.

10:34.944 --> 10:37.479
But it "amuses and entertains"
the entire community, Crosby.

10:37.513 --> 10:39.515
Every episode gets over
two million hits.

10:39.548 --> 10:42.952
The idea behind community service is
to provide a fair level of restitution.

10:42.985 --> 10:46.722
Well, it's not like I robbed a bank,
or put someone in the hospital.

10:47.823 --> 10:49.158
That wasn't a hospital!

10:49.959 --> 10:52.328
Anyway, I put in a lot of
time and effort into it.

10:52.361 --> 10:55.397
You play the cello off to the side
of a very strange ventriloquist.

10:55.431 --> 10:58.834
Well, I choose the music, I
practice it, I perform it.

10:58.867 --> 11:02.304
I do my own goth makeup.
I bought a dress!

11:02.338 --> 11:04.073
I'm not judging your
work ethic, Ruth.

11:04.106 --> 11:09.178
I'm saying what if you played the cello at an
elder care facility or a homeless shelter.

11:10.346 --> 11:12.281
I was just thinking
outside the box.

11:12.314 --> 11:13.650
We're shooting another
one tonight.

11:13.683 --> 11:16.485
Well, I better not see those
hours on your paperwork next week.

11:17.553 --> 11:21.790
You're off probation soon, so let's go
for some real community service, huh?

11:26.328 --> 11:27.796
I did it again, didn't I?

11:29.198 --> 11:32.067
Don't get me wrong, Ruth,
I'm thrilled he's getting out of hospice.

11:32.101 --> 11:33.035
I'm just saying:

11:34.169 --> 11:36.138
What if he gets out and he
doesn't have a home anymore?

11:36.171 --> 11:38.007
I know, I know...

11:38.040 --> 11:40.209
Can't you just tell him the
truth? Maybe he could help.

11:40.242 --> 11:42.878
He's as broke as we are. He doesn't
have that kind of money anymore.

11:42.911 --> 11:46.015
Okay, then just tell the bank
that your dad's in hospice.

11:46.048 --> 11:49.351
That oughta buy you some time.
They wouldn't foreclose on a hospice guy.

11:49.385 --> 11:51.086
I told them that already.

11:51.120 --> 11:53.289
How the hell do you think I've
kept them out for ten months?

11:53.322 --> 11:54.390
You used that already?

11:54.423 --> 11:56.225
Yeah, when that guy came by!

11:56.258 --> 11:58.494
I thought you just flirted
your way out of that.

11:58.527 --> 12:00.963
Of ten months of back payments
and penalties?

12:00.996 --> 12:02.965
I don't have those kind
of flirting skills.

12:02.998 --> 12:06.201
Oh, Ruth I think you played
that hospice card way too soon.

12:06.235 --> 12:07.403
We'll think of something.

12:08.203 --> 12:09.171
You girls ready?

12:09.204 --> 12:10.472
It's not time yet...

12:10.506 --> 12:12.007
You're sure it's
okay if I watch?

12:12.041 --> 12:14.009
Errol seems kind of
temperamental.

12:14.043 --> 12:16.178
Don't worry, he likes
people watching him.

12:16.211 --> 12:17.112
Trust me.

12:17.146 --> 12:18.547
Get your stuff.

12:18.581 --> 12:21.116
I'm not even dressed yet!
What's the hurry?

12:21.150 --> 12:24.086
I just thought we'd stop by the
freight building before we hit Errol's.

12:24.119 --> 12:26.088
Why?
What's at the freight building?

12:27.990 --> 12:30.092
You guys wanna see
a dead president?

12:35.197 --> 12:37.132
So I guess she lives
in Scottsdale now.

12:44.306 --> 12:47.209
So they shipped him all
the way from Pennsylvania?

12:47.242 --> 12:48.510
That's kinda gross.

13:00.456 --> 13:02.257
Actually, he never married.

13:02.291 --> 13:04.026
The only bachelor president.

13:04.059 --> 13:05.961
We won't get in trouble
for being here?

13:05.994 --> 13:08.263
- I mean if a security guard sees us, you won't...
- Security?

13:08.297 --> 13:10.899
We custodians are the
security around this place.

13:12.301 --> 13:13.369
He's in a crate?

13:13.402 --> 13:16.271
No, the casket's in the crate.
He's in the casket.

13:18.140 --> 13:21.043
They ship him out first thing in
the morning straight to the airport.

13:21.578 --> 13:23.212
They're flying him back.

13:24.581 --> 13:27.449
By this time tomorrow, he'll be
back underground, resting in peace.

13:29.385 --> 13:34.123
I bet Gretchen has opened and closed this thing
about fifty times today, showing it off.

13:38.927 --> 13:42.197
Shouldn't he be in a refrigerator
or on ice or something?

13:42.231 --> 13:43.399
That's what I thought.

13:43.432 --> 13:46.034
But I guess he stopped stinking
about a hundred years ago.

13:46.068 --> 13:48.270
He smells old, but he
doesn't smell bad.

13:49.271 --> 13:50.272
Okay...

13:50.305 --> 13:51.206
Behold!

13:51.240 --> 13:52.574
The grizzled remains

13:52.609 --> 13:57.446
of the fifteenth President of the
United States, James Buchanan.

14:00.015 --> 14:01.483
Wow.

14:01.517 --> 14:03.653
Oh, that's horrifying.

14:03.686 --> 14:04.587
I know!

14:06.021 --> 14:08.123
Oh, that'll make a lovely
Christmas card.

14:08.157 --> 14:08.957
I know.

14:08.991 --> 14:10.559
This is what he used
to look like.

14:10.593 --> 14:12.662
Gretchen's brother
is a philatelist.

14:12.695 --> 14:14.930
That's disgusting.
Poor Gretchen.

14:15.732 --> 14:19.401
I hate to say it, but I don't think
I've even heard of James Buchanan.

14:19.435 --> 14:21.537
He was the guy right
before Lincoln.

14:21.570 --> 14:23.305
Supposed to be the worst
president ever.

14:23.338 --> 14:25.507
Seriously, I looked
him up - the worst.

14:25.541 --> 14:26.408
Well...

14:27.342 --> 14:28.944
What made him worse
than all the others?

14:28.977 --> 14:32.347
There was the whole slavery issue.
You know, he was on the wrong side of that.

14:32.381 --> 14:34.584
And then the country started
falling apart.

14:34.617 --> 14:37.519
You know - States breaking off,
and he didn't do shit to stop that.

14:37.553 --> 14:41.056
He was a career politician, spineless,
couldn't make tough decisions.

14:41.089 --> 14:44.326
Oh! Historians refer to him as
a useless sack of crap.

14:44.359 --> 14:46.528
Oh, check out what he had
buried with him...

14:47.196 --> 14:48.598
You went through his pockets?

14:48.631 --> 14:49.732
Not all of them.

14:51.066 --> 14:52.769
Who's that?

14:52.802 --> 14:57.105
This is William Rufus King, Vice President
under some other president no one remembers.

14:57.139 --> 15:01.043
Also, Buchanan's roommate
for thirteen years.

15:01.076 --> 15:02.478
Also a "bachelor."

15:05.147 --> 15:06.515
He looks peaceful.

15:06.548 --> 15:08.317
He looks like a fucking ghoul.

15:08.350 --> 15:12.221
Well, this ghoul happens to be the most valuable
thing that's ever come through this dock.

15:12.254 --> 15:15.557
At one point in time, this nauseating
bag of bones was running the country.

15:15.592 --> 15:18.661
It's hard to imagine Abraham
Lincoln taking orders from this guy.

15:18.695 --> 15:22.531
Well, early on in his career,
Jimi Hendrix opened for The Monkees.

15:36.779 --> 15:39.348
If it comes up short, I'll just
replay it again from here.

15:39.381 --> 15:41.283
As long as it doesn't
break the mood.

15:41.316 --> 15:44.453
If the mood is broken then the
music serves no purpose.

15:45.087 --> 15:47.690
Oh Errol, this is
Meg, my roommate.

15:47.724 --> 15:50.259
- Hi.
- Nice to finally meet you.

15:50.292 --> 15:52.695
Sorry, it's wet from
the bathroom.

15:52.729 --> 15:57.667
I mean, it's water, I washed them.
It's not urine or anything.

15:57.700 --> 15:59.501
That's how you meet someone?

15:59.535 --> 16:02.170
"Nice to meet you, my hands
aren't covered in urine?"

16:02.204 --> 16:03.740
Delightful.

16:03.773 --> 16:06.776
You'll be observing tonight then, will
you, Meg? From a safe distance, yes.

16:09.111 --> 16:09.946
Dante!

16:10.580 --> 16:13.549
I asked for cream soda
not soda water!

16:13.583 --> 16:16.218
Sorry, Errol. I was going for
the healthier choice.

16:16.251 --> 16:18.053
- Hi, Ruth.
- Hey, Dante.

16:18.554 --> 16:19.923
Apologies.

16:19.956 --> 16:23.492
Anger is my traveling companion...
and sometimes I let him drive.

16:24.560 --> 16:26.261
This is Trina.

16:27.262 --> 16:29.298
She's developing her gift.

16:29.866 --> 16:31.834
Are you interested
in ventriloquism?

16:31.868 --> 16:34.436
Me? God, no.

16:34.469 --> 16:35.805
Not really. No.

16:37.607 --> 16:41.778
It really is the sort of analog art form that
will remain long after the bombs are dropped.

16:41.811 --> 16:43.646
Cockroaches and ventriloquism.

16:43.680 --> 16:47.584
Well, I know I could never do a
puppet show like you do.

16:47.617 --> 16:52.120
But I like those little dummies.
And their little suits, very smart.

16:55.758 --> 16:58.493
It's pretty sad when the happiest
part of that conversation

16:58.527 --> 17:00.429
was about soaking
your hands in urine.

17:00.462 --> 17:02.531
Please. He was lucky I was
as kind as I was.

17:02.564 --> 17:04.333
This whole thing is
fucking idiotic.

17:04.366 --> 17:07.135
You don't appreciate it
as an art form, Meg.

17:07.169 --> 17:09.404
You don't understand
the beauty of it.

17:30.292 --> 17:31.193
Shit!

17:31.961 --> 17:33.495
What's the goddamn line?

17:38.200 --> 17:40.469
You're sure that's German
for "piano wire"?

17:43.840 --> 17:45.608
Okay, we're going again!

17:46.308 --> 17:48.645
Take nine! Okay.

17:50.747 --> 17:51.848
Ruth, you can start it up.

17:53.482 --> 17:54.449
Ruth!

17:56.986 --> 17:58.588
- <i>Ruth!</i>
- What?

17:58.621 --> 17:59.922
I'm leaving.

17:59.956 --> 18:02.224
Last chance. It's gonna be fun.

18:02.257 --> 18:03.492
Lots of guys.

18:03.525 --> 18:05.762
Guys who play with dolls.

18:05.795 --> 18:07.362
No thanks, Holly.

18:07.396 --> 18:08.598
Your loss.

18:09.231 --> 18:09.899
Don't wait up...

18:14.269 --> 18:16.739
You've been in a weird mood tonight.

18:16.773 --> 18:17.640
Not really.

18:18.507 --> 18:21.209
Let's go get some coffee.
My treat.

18:21.243 --> 18:22.277
You're broke.

18:23.012 --> 18:24.013
Buy me some coffee?

18:26.548 --> 18:28.483
You know how people talk
about motivation,

18:28.517 --> 18:30.586
how you hang a
carrot from a stick

18:30.620 --> 18:32.689
to make the horse pull the wagon
and all that?

18:32.722 --> 18:35.825
Sure, the famous "Carrot-and-Stick
Horse Wagon Theorem."

18:35.858 --> 18:37.225
Yeah.

18:37.259 --> 18:38.795
Well, for as long as I can
remember,

18:38.828 --> 18:40.830
every time I've ever
gotten close to a carrot,

18:40.863 --> 18:42.564
it turned out just to be an
orange stick.

18:42.598 --> 18:44.934
- And I was right back at the beginning again.
- Yeah.

18:44.967 --> 18:48.004
But I think I might have
finally gotten hold of a carrot.

18:48.037 --> 18:48.905
Yeah?

18:50.505 --> 18:53.810
I know how we can get my dad's mortgage
back up to date, pay off all our bills,

18:53.843 --> 18:56.913
get your Mom's shit out of hock,
the fines, everything.

18:56.946 --> 18:59.582
It doesn't involve drugs or
prostitution, does it?

18:59.615 --> 19:02.952
I know the media tends to sugarcoat
those things to make them sound more fun

19:02.985 --> 19:05.855
- and they sound really fun, but...
- No, no, no. It's very simple.

19:06.789 --> 19:09.558
We're going to steal the corpse
of President James Buchanan.

19:12.360 --> 19:15.330
That's ridiculous... isn't it?

19:15.363 --> 19:17.265
That's what they said about
the Wright Brothers!

19:17.734 --> 19:19.401
But you're talking
about kidnapping!

19:19.434 --> 19:21.470
What kidnapping?
He's already dead.

19:21.503 --> 19:23.039
It's grave-robbing at best.

19:23.072 --> 19:26.008
- Will there be a ransom? Gonna write a ransom note?
- Yeah...

19:26.042 --> 19:28.911
As soon as a ransom note comes
into the picture, it's kidnapping.

19:28.945 --> 19:31.714
That's Crime 101.
You can go to prison, Ruth.

19:31.748 --> 19:34.617
No, we could go to prison.
But we won't.

19:34.650 --> 19:36.551
- Know why?
- I don't know.

19:36.586 --> 19:39.655
- Why?
- Because we have three things on our side:

19:39.689 --> 19:43.458
Brains, guts, and...

19:43.492 --> 19:45.327
Uh... motive?

19:45.360 --> 19:46.428
No...

19:46.461 --> 19:47.697
A truck?

19:48.497 --> 19:49.599
Okay, a truck.

19:49.632 --> 19:50.967
I don't know, Ruth.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.568
It's kind of a shitty way to
treat this guy, isn't it?

19:53.603 --> 19:54.837
Where's the harm?

19:54.871 --> 19:57.039
He's gonna wind up
back in his grave.

19:57.073 --> 19:59.976
Think of it like a millhouse
on a river.

20:00.009 --> 20:03.713
It uses the flowing water to
turn the big paddle-wheel,

20:03.746 --> 20:06.616
to
make cornmeal or something.

20:06.649 --> 20:08.517
But the water goes
back to the sea.

20:08.550 --> 20:10.385
We're just using
it for a second.

20:10.418 --> 20:13.623
Besides, you said you were planning
to become more unpredictable.

20:16.092 --> 20:19.629
I'm in a corner here, Meg.
My options ran out a few months ago.

20:19.662 --> 20:22.732
This isn't some half-assed adventure here.
I'm trying to survive.

20:23.666 --> 20:24.533
I need your help.

20:25.400 --> 20:26.836
Big time, I need your help.

20:29.839 --> 20:30.907
Okay, I'm in.

20:33.142 --> 20:35.611
Oh, that is so awesome, Meg.
You just saved my life.

20:36.145 --> 20:39.048
Okay, finish your mochiatta and
we'll begin the hijinks.

20:39.081 --> 20:41.550
Wait, we'll need Holly
along, right?

20:41.584 --> 20:43.418
- Why?
- She has the keys.

20:46.989 --> 20:48.925
You stole those from Holly?

20:48.958 --> 20:51.359
No, I didn't "steal"
them from Holly.

20:51.393 --> 20:52.962
They don't belong to Holly.

20:52.995 --> 20:55.064
She just uses them because
she works there.

20:55.097 --> 20:57.566
- But Holly will get in trouble.
- No, she won't.

20:57.600 --> 20:59.001
That's why we can't tell her.

20:59.035 --> 21:01.671
If she's in on it, then she'll be
a suspect because she has the keys.

21:01.704 --> 21:03.538
This keeps her absolutely safe.

21:03.572 --> 21:04.674
Don't worry about Holly.

21:04.707 --> 21:06.609
- We'll cut her in after we get the ransom.
- Okay.

21:11.047 --> 21:12.982
You think that guy overheard us?

21:13.015 --> 21:15.417
What if he overheard us
talking about this shit?

21:15.952 --> 21:16.819
Wait...

21:18.087 --> 21:21.858
So, Jillian, do you think this
bikini top is too small on me?

21:27.797 --> 21:29.497
Nah, we're good.

21:35.605 --> 21:38.007
We're not gonna take the
whole casket, are we?

21:38.040 --> 21:42.178
No, I saw some big boxes in
there and some bubble wrap.

21:42.211 --> 21:43.779
We'll just figure it out.

21:43.813 --> 21:46.082
And who exactly are we going
to ransom him off to?

21:46.115 --> 21:49.118
I told you: I'm gonna email the
ransom note to the government.

21:49.151 --> 21:50.987
I mean specifically who?

21:51.020 --> 21:54.590
You can't write an email to
government@government.gov.

21:54.624 --> 21:56.391
Don't worry, I'll find
the appropriate...

22:09.105 --> 22:12.875
Some lady in New Jersey owns Napoleon's
penis, and she says that she...

22:12.909 --> 22:16.544
Wait! Why the hell does some lady
in New Jersey own Napoleon's penis?

22:16.579 --> 22:18.147
She inherited it
from her father.

22:19.148 --> 22:20.783
Oh, okay.

22:20.816 --> 22:23.052
She says she got offered a
hundred-grand for it.

22:23.085 --> 22:25.888
A hundred thousand dollars?
Is it musical or something?

22:25.922 --> 22:31.559
No, it's "one inch long and resembles a
maltreated strip of buckskin shoelace."

22:31.594 --> 22:33.729
Eww! No wonder he was so angry.

22:33.763 --> 22:36.165
Some moron actually paid a
hundred thousand dollars for it?

22:36.198 --> 22:37.934
She didn't actually sell it.

22:37.967 --> 22:40.036
It was handed down
from her father.

22:40.069 --> 22:42.504
Mmm... okay I call
bullshit on that.

22:42.537 --> 22:46.042
Nobody refuses that kind of money
for a historical buckskin penis

22:46.075 --> 22:48.510
no matter how touching
that deathbed scene is!

22:48.543 --> 22:50.746
If my father leaves me a
shriveled dork in his will,

22:50.780 --> 22:53.182
I'm making a fucking smoothie out
of it and pouring it on his grave.

22:54.016 --> 22:55.651
I was thinking about the
grave-robbing charge.

22:55.685 --> 22:59.989
I'll grant you that it might not be kidnapping
but it's probably theft and burglary.

23:01.023 --> 23:02.658
You can't steal a human being.

23:02.692 --> 23:04.860
A person is not a
piece of property.

23:04.894 --> 23:06.062
That would be slavery!

23:06.796 --> 23:08.698
And look where slavery got
President Buchanan.

23:09.231 --> 23:11.968
Buried under some Christmas
ornaments in our garage?

23:12.001 --> 23:13.002
That is a sorry-ass fate.

23:13.035 --> 23:15.671
I still can't believe how
light his body was.

23:16.205 --> 23:19.642
Well, you take the moisture out of a
guy and he's just a pile of sticks.

23:20.676 --> 23:21.877
You better get ready for work.

23:21.911 --> 23:24.580
Me? You mean you're not
working at all today?

23:24.613 --> 23:27.249
No way. I've got to manage
this situation.

23:27.283 --> 23:29.585
I gotta get to the library
and send that email.

23:29.618 --> 23:32.121
First, I gotta create a new email address.
Untraceable.

23:32.855 --> 23:35.523
I want them to get it right before
they get the call from Pennsylvania

23:35.557 --> 23:37.026
saying that the
casket's empty.

23:37.059 --> 23:38.961
Just tell Gunderson I'm sick.

23:38.995 --> 23:41.597
Uhh... He's gonna need more
than just "sick."

23:41.630 --> 23:45.167
Well, tell him any ailment but put
the word "vaginal" in front of it.

23:45.201 --> 23:48.270
That way, if he questions it, he's gonna
have a harassment suit on his hands.

23:49.571 --> 23:50.873
"Vaginal pneumonia."

23:51.640 --> 23:52.574
Might work.

24:41.857 --> 24:42.758
Wait a minute...

24:43.759 --> 24:44.760
What a dick!

24:45.227 --> 24:46.095
What?

24:47.229 --> 24:49.298
The whole "moral evil" statement.
What a crock.

24:49.331 --> 24:51.100
It was not a crock...

24:52.268 --> 24:53.636
...it was the truth.

24:54.370 --> 24:55.771
No, no.

24:55.805 --> 24:57.673
You're trying to play both
sides of this thing.

24:57.706 --> 24:59.909
You say slavery is "a great
moral evil"

24:59.942 --> 25:03.112
and then you spend your entire political
career trying to keep it going.

25:03.145 --> 25:05.748
I'm afraid that's not entirely
true, my dear.

25:05.781 --> 25:08.017
You've drawn a naive conclusion.

25:08.050 --> 25:08.918
It's right here!

25:10.686 --> 25:12.688
You've barely started that book.

25:12.721 --> 25:16.292
And I cannot vouch for the
author's impartiality.

25:16.325 --> 25:20.830
If you would prefer a more
enlightened account of these events,

25:20.863 --> 25:23.399
I would recommend my own
book,

25:23.432 --> 25:27.203
<i>Mr. Buchanan's Administration on
the Eve of Rebellion.</i>

25:27.236 --> 25:28.504
That's the title?

25:28.537 --> 25:31.941
<i>Mr. Buchanan's Administration
on the Eve of Rebellion?</i>

25:32.374 --> 25:35.344
Oh my God, that is seriously
the worst title I've ever heard.

25:35.377 --> 25:38.247
Oh, lacks pungency?

25:38.280 --> 25:40.015
Yeah, it blows.

25:40.049 --> 25:41.150
You need an editor.

25:42.151 --> 25:45.254
You've made an enormous
mistake, Miss Kiesling.

25:45.287 --> 25:46.322
What?

25:46.355 --> 25:48.958
You know you cannot possibly
get away with this.

25:48.991 --> 25:53.896
You will spend a significant portion of your
remaining years in a federal penitentiary.

25:53.929 --> 25:58.067
For you, madam, are a
shiftless reprobate.

25:58.100 --> 25:59.902
I thought we were
talking about you.

26:00.436 --> 26:01.837
Ah, yes.

26:01.871 --> 26:04.140
Well, to criticize me,

26:04.173 --> 26:07.977
you must first understand the
time into which I was born.

26:08.010 --> 26:10.179
No man has a choice in that.

26:10.212 --> 26:12.281
And to me, all endeavors,

26:12.314 --> 26:15.718
even moral ones are answerable

26:15.751 --> 26:19.121
not to the fickle tide of
popular opinion but to the law.

26:19.155 --> 26:22.791
For all endeavors there
is but one master.

26:22.825 --> 26:23.826
God?

26:23.859 --> 26:25.060
The law!

26:25.494 --> 26:28.664
I acknowledge no master
but the law.

26:29.165 --> 26:30.432
So you don't believe in God?

26:31.133 --> 26:34.370
Well, yes, but you're
missing the point.

26:34.403 --> 26:36.839
It's very dramatic,
what I'm saying.

26:36.872 --> 26:38.474
No, the law, I got it.

26:38.507 --> 26:42.745
But the government is supposed
to change the stupid ones, right?

26:42.778 --> 26:44.380
And what do you know
of government?

26:44.413 --> 26:46.815
I was in student government
ever since fifth grade.

26:46.849 --> 26:49.118
And in high school I was elected
officer every year.

26:49.151 --> 26:53.322
Secretary, treasurer, veep until
my senior class, I was president...

26:54.023 --> 26:55.024
For a while.

26:55.524 --> 26:56.892
"For a while?"

26:56.926 --> 26:58.093
That didn't work out.

26:59.195 --> 27:03.399
So this is your area
of expertise?

27:04.233 --> 27:05.234
No.

27:05.267 --> 27:07.236
But I know enough about it

27:07.269 --> 27:11.840
to know that you can't lump slavery
in with shoplifting and horseplay.

27:13.909 --> 27:16.011
All endeavors...

27:23.986 --> 27:25.087
Hey how'd it go?

27:25.120 --> 27:28.991
Good. Did Gunderson buy that
vaginal pneumonia story?

27:29.024 --> 27:31.126
Pneumonia! Pneumonia!

27:31.160 --> 27:33.162
I couldn't remember "pneumonia"
for the life of me.

27:33.195 --> 27:34.664
I kept thinking "whooping
cough".

27:34.698 --> 27:38.100
So in case Gunderson asks,
you had a 24-hour case of whooping vagina.

27:39.034 --> 27:41.203
So did you get it all done?
The ransom note?

27:41.237 --> 27:43.906
Yup. Short and sweet.
Just like writing ourselves a check.

27:43.939 --> 27:45.975
This is so cool!

27:46.008 --> 27:47.943
So how do we handle
the money drop?

27:47.977 --> 27:51.780
Well, I didn't put it in the note,
but I figured out an awesome plan.

27:51.814 --> 27:55.017
Took me a couple of hours, but
it is top-notch caper shit!

27:55.050 --> 27:56.352
- Ready?
- Yeah.

27:58.520 --> 28:01.423
<i>First, we tell them that
the drop will be at the Quik-Run</i>

28:01.457 --> 28:03.092
at Washington
and 40th Street at 11 am.

28:03.125 --> 28:04.526
They are to put a 150,000...

28:04.560 --> 28:06.962
I'll be watching the
bagman from behind the wall...

28:06.996 --> 28:09.898
...the westbound light rail train and
I call the bagman from a cell phone...

28:09.932 --> 28:11.333
...to get off at McDowell
station...

28:11.367 --> 28:13.135
Are you sure it's
the "bagman?"

28:13.168 --> 28:15.938
He's got the bag, so yeah.
Come on, you're killing the flow.

28:15.971 --> 28:19.008
- Sorry.
- I direct him to the side of the building...

28:19.041 --> 28:20.242
He'll toss the bag and press...

28:20.276 --> 28:21.611
...and when the elevator opens...

28:21.645 --> 28:24.246
...11:30, a small group from the
third floor leaves for lunch...

28:24.280 --> 28:26.815
...drop it down to me where I'll
be and leave as if you're...

28:26.849 --> 28:29.184
...go back to the alley and move
east to my car on 3rd Street

28:29.218 --> 28:30.853
where our carefree future
awaits.

28:31.387 --> 28:35.257
Oh my God. It's like criminal
<i>Beautiful Minds.</i>

28:35.291 --> 28:36.358
It's brilliant!

28:37.293 --> 28:38.927
You're like an evil
genius!

28:40.929 --> 28:41.797
I know!

28:42.498 --> 28:43.966
Might be too late.

28:43.999 --> 28:46.902
When I checked earlier, it was already
after six o'clock Washington time.

28:46.935 --> 28:48.537
Yeah, but it can't
hurt to check.

28:57.513 --> 28:58.847
The library is closing!

29:02.418 --> 29:03.586
We're closing, ladies.

29:08.057 --> 29:09.659
Well, they got back to us
at least,

29:09.693 --> 29:13.962
but I think they think we're asking for a
federal grant for some historical study.

29:13.996 --> 29:16.599
I'll bet this link goes
to a grant application.

29:16.633 --> 29:18.534
And why do they need your
social security number?

29:18.567 --> 29:20.536
Are they planning to
tax us on the ransom?

29:20.569 --> 29:23.872
I know we're first-time kidnappers,
but I don't think that's customary.

29:23.906 --> 29:26.075
No. And I'm sure giving them a
bank routing number

29:26.108 --> 29:29.945
would be more efficient but it
feels like we'd be tipping our hand.

29:29.978 --> 29:30.946
Rookie mistake.

29:31.614 --> 29:33.148
Why did you write "Yours
in Christ" at the end?

29:33.182 --> 29:36.318
To make them think we were religious
fanatics to throw them off the scent.

29:36.352 --> 29:37.886
Good thinking...

29:44.661 --> 29:47.396
You don't think anyone could have
been watching the library, do you?

29:47.429 --> 29:48.497
Like the Feds or something?

29:48.530 --> 29:51.133
I'm just saying what if the
library has cameras.

29:51.166 --> 29:52.635
And you checked out
a book on Buchanan.

29:52.669 --> 29:54.637
How many people actually
do that on purpose?

29:55.571 --> 29:57.607
Well, I didn't check
it out officially.

29:57.640 --> 29:58.675
Ruth...

29:58.708 --> 30:00.943
Besides, we don't have to use
that email anymore

30:00.976 --> 30:03.045
because we have this lady's
number: Parnella Monroe.

30:03.078 --> 30:05.615
Cool, we can take a long lunch
and give her a call tomorrow.

30:05.648 --> 30:07.116
Oh! Mormons!

30:10.352 --> 30:12.354
Hey, do you wanna
grab some dinner?

30:13.021 --> 30:14.156
I can't.

30:14.189 --> 30:16.525
I have to re-shoot that "Drang
und Sturm" video again.

30:16.558 --> 30:17.393
Again? Why?

30:17.426 --> 30:19.895
Errol thought of something
more ironic.

30:20.529 --> 30:22.064
Like you said, he's
temperamental.

30:27.269 --> 30:28.137
Lights!

30:33.375 --> 30:36.646
You can't be serious about
that "Dred Scott decision".

30:36.679 --> 30:38.615
You actually agreed with that?

30:38.648 --> 30:39.716
Indeed.

30:39.749 --> 30:42.518
It was a Supreme Court decision.

30:43.152 --> 30:45.154
Man, that's some evil nonsense.

30:46.155 --> 30:49.425
Again, Miss Kiesling, you
are missing the point.

30:49.458 --> 30:53.028
Slavery was a legal issue
not a moral one.

30:53.061 --> 30:58.167
The law considered slaves property, and
as such carried the rights of ownership.

30:58.200 --> 31:03.071
Congress makes the laws; the
president merely administers them.

31:03.539 --> 31:04.741
That's a cop-out.

31:04.774 --> 31:08.477
In chapter three, you talked
about how much you hate slavery

31:08.510 --> 31:11.246
and how you're glad you live in
a state where it doesn't exist.

31:11.280 --> 31:14.216
And then when you get in a position
to do something about it...

31:15.618 --> 31:17.620
See, this is why you were
a shitty president.

31:18.554 --> 31:23.492
Ruth, I'm going to stretch my
non-verbal skills after the second line.

31:23.525 --> 31:27.262
So if you can just vamp
until I do the eye-roll.

31:27.296 --> 31:29.699
Got it. "Vamp until
the eye-roll."

31:29.732 --> 31:30.966
Dante!

31:31.567 --> 31:33.703
Why am I the villain?

31:33.736 --> 31:35.437
I never owned slaves.

31:35.471 --> 31:37.406
Washington? Jefferson?

31:37.439 --> 31:39.141
They were slave owners.

31:39.174 --> 31:41.510
And are they held
up for ridicule? No.

31:41.543 --> 31:44.480
They have their faces carved
into a mountain

31:44.513 --> 31:47.617
while I'm only
found on a twenty-cent stamp!

31:47.650 --> 31:49.518
Okay, that's not a bad point.

31:51.320 --> 31:55.224
But calling them out by saying, "They're just
as bad as I was" is a pretty creepy argument.

31:55.257 --> 31:57.392
And those guys did shit!

31:57.426 --> 32:01.063
You don't get your face put on money
or mountains by spinning your wheels.

32:01.631 --> 32:03.365
And it was a fifteen-cent stamp.

32:05.100 --> 32:09.706
Permit me to point out that those are very
high-minded platitudes for a grave robber.

32:09.739 --> 32:14.510
And worse: one who kowtows to
an arrogant puppeteer.

32:15.444 --> 32:17.079
Don't get snappy.

32:17.112 --> 32:21.116
I'm just trying to wrap my head around why
the voters elected a boob for president.

32:21.684 --> 32:23.018
A "boob?"

32:23.051 --> 32:27.389
Would a "boob" serve as Minister
to the United Kingdom and Russia?

32:27.422 --> 32:30.727
Could he hold the office
of Secretary of State?

32:30.760 --> 32:34.429
A "boob" would never be elected
to both the United States Senate

32:34.463 --> 32:36.365
and the House of
Representatives.

32:36.398 --> 32:39.535
Nor would he be offered an
appointment to the Supreme Court.

32:39.568 --> 32:41.804
And a "boob," my good woman,

32:41.838 --> 32:44.807
does not and cannot engender the
goodwill

32:44.841 --> 32:48.143
required to stand as
President of the United States.

32:48.176 --> 32:52.682
This is nothing less than the
curriculum vitae of a statesman!

32:55.250 --> 32:57.286
Maybe "boob" isn't
the right word.

33:00.790 --> 33:02.424
Apology accepted.

33:04.326 --> 33:06.629
Give me
the money or Buchanan gets it!

33:06.663 --> 33:07.563
That's cool!

33:07.597 --> 33:09.431
You can disguise
your voice on the phone.

33:09.464 --> 33:11.768
I had my sister bring it by.
It's my nephew's.

33:11.801 --> 33:14.236
That's great. Doesn't sound
very intimidating, though.

33:14.269 --> 33:16.673
It's got a bunch of other
settings, not just the alien one.

33:17.774 --> 33:20.743
Don't force
me to set fire to the president.

33:20.777 --> 33:23.378
Sounds like we're calling from
a corrugated drainage pipe.

33:23.412 --> 33:24.814
That'll throw 'em off the scent!

33:24.847 --> 33:26.749
Did you figure out where we
can steal a cell phone?

33:26.783 --> 33:29.484
There's a couple of restaurants on
Mill Avenue with outdoor patios.

33:29.518 --> 33:31.788
- Tables right off the sidewalk.
- Cool...

33:31.821 --> 33:36.726
Then at lunch, we ride!

33:36.759 --> 33:38.327
Okay, there's our guy.

33:38.895 --> 33:40.529
You go in and flirt with
him.

33:40.562 --> 33:43.666
When you've got him looking the other
direction, I'll swoop in and grab his phone.

33:43.700 --> 33:44.734
I can't flirt.

33:44.767 --> 33:46.435
You should be the
one who flirts.

33:46.468 --> 33:47.604
I'll grab the phone.

33:47.637 --> 33:50.172
I have never had the skill set
to flirt intentionally.

33:50.205 --> 33:51.373
I'll look ridiculous.

33:51.406 --> 33:53.743
No, Ruth. You're really pretty.

33:53.776 --> 33:55.778
You just have to walk
up to him and smile.

33:55.812 --> 33:58.213
I can't smile on cue like that.

33:58.246 --> 33:59.147
Try it... right now.

33:59.181 --> 34:01.116
Give me a sexy smile.

34:05.722 --> 34:07.289
Okay, I'll flirt with him.

34:07.322 --> 34:08.858
But I can't guarantee results.

34:08.891 --> 34:10.627
I got it: take off your
bra.

34:10.659 --> 34:13.462
- What?
- You want results? Take your bra off.

34:13.495 --> 34:14.764
Nobody wants to see that.

34:14.797 --> 34:17.264
You know my nipples don't
line up anymore.

34:17.299 --> 34:20.603
It doesn't matter if he's looking because
he's turned on or because he's horrified.

34:20.637 --> 34:21.804
We just want him looking.

34:24.206 --> 34:25.373
Fine.

34:27.309 --> 34:28.911
Hi. Excuse me...

34:29.612 --> 34:31.714
Can you please tell me the time?

34:33.783 --> 34:38.286
Sure, no problem. You cannot
spell time without "me".

34:38.320 --> 34:40.489
Or "it".

34:40.522 --> 34:42.391
Oh, I get it.

34:42.424 --> 34:43.726
Or "met."

34:43.760 --> 34:45.393
Okay, this isn't "Boggle."

34:52.601 --> 34:53.467
What do you think?

34:54.436 --> 34:56.505
Hello, Miss Monroe.

34:56.538 --> 34:57.907
Nice.

35:00.777 --> 35:01.944
Parnella Monroe.

35:02.812 --> 35:05.347
Hello, Miss Monroe.

35:05.848 --> 35:07.516
Can you repeat that?

35:08.851 --> 35:11.688
Is this Miss Monroe?

35:14.857 --> 35:15.758
Shit.

35:15.792 --> 35:16.726
What happened?

35:20.797 --> 35:22.464
Parnella Monroe.

35:22.497 --> 35:25.267
This is Mr. X, Miss Monroe.

35:25.968 --> 35:27.369
Yes, Mr. X.

35:27.402 --> 35:30.472
We had a correspondence about a "Mr.
Buchanan." How can I assist you?

35:30.505 --> 35:34.476
Well, I'm just following up
on that correspondence.

35:34.509 --> 35:36.344
I got your response,

35:36.378 --> 35:39.247
but it seems to be all about
applying for a grant

35:39.281 --> 35:42.585
and needing our social security
number and banking information.

35:42.618 --> 35:45.387
I hope you don't think we'd be
stupid enough to give you that shit.

35:45.420 --> 35:48.290
I didn't mean to insinuate a lack
of intelligence on your part.

35:48.323 --> 35:51.326
But I hope that you realize that
as an arm of the US Government,

35:51.359 --> 35:54.897
we have to provide a certain amount of
transparency for any financial outlay.

35:54.931 --> 35:56.364
Is it about the amount?

35:57.499 --> 35:59.468
What if we lowered it to a
hundred thousand dollars?

35:59.501 --> 36:01.570
That's a very generous
counteroffer, Mr. X,

36:01.604 --> 36:04.607
but my office is not authorized
to make that size of a payment

36:04.640 --> 36:06.408
without going through a formal
bid process.

36:06.441 --> 36:10.278
This isn't a payment or a bid; this
is a ransom for James Buchanan.

36:10.312 --> 36:12.014
A ransom for a kidnapping?

36:12.048 --> 36:13.950
Yes. Kind of.

36:13.983 --> 36:15.985
And you say the gentleman
is deceased.

36:16.018 --> 36:16.986
He is.

36:17.019 --> 36:19.554
As I understand the protocol of
a kidnapping,

36:19.589 --> 36:23.059
the basis for a ransom or the collateral
is the life of the person being kidnapped.

36:23.092 --> 36:26.629
A kidnapped victim with no life has no
leverage. You understand my point, Mr. X?

36:26.662 --> 36:29.766
You understand that this is a former
president we're talking about, right?

36:29.799 --> 36:32.068
I'm aware of Mr. Buchanan's
former occupation.

36:32.101 --> 36:34.604
But you have no collateral
with which to bargain.

36:34.637 --> 36:36.806
<i>A quick call to Woodland Mill
Cemetery this morning</i>

36:36.839 --> 36:40.509
confirmed that Mr. Buchanan was safely
reinterred yesterday afternoon without incident.

36:40.542 --> 36:42.779
Wait, that's not true!
I've got him!

36:42.812 --> 36:45.514
They just didn't open up the
coffin to find out it was empty!

36:45.547 --> 36:46.949
You've gotta dig him back up!

36:46.983 --> 36:49.551
This is a hundred thousand dollar
president we're talking about here!

36:49.585 --> 36:51.553
You are overplaying
your hand, Mr. X.

36:51.587 --> 36:55.691
This is not Abraham Lincoln or Teddy
Roosevelt or even Millard G.D. Fillmore.

36:55.725 --> 36:58.326
James Buchanan was a
terrible president.

36:58.360 --> 36:59.929
Perhaps our shittiest one.

37:00.830 --> 37:01.697
Well...

37:03.199 --> 37:04.466
So, in the future, if you are going
to claim to have dug up a president,

37:04.499 --> 37:07.402
you might want to go for one
of the more marquee gentlemen.

37:08.104 --> 37:12.340
Um... can I talk to
your manager or...

37:12.374 --> 37:15.812
Might I make a suggestion, Mr. X? Kidnapping
is a very serious federal offense.

37:15.845 --> 37:18.047
It's not kidnapping,
you said it yourself.

37:18.080 --> 37:19.949
Grave-robbing is the worst
that it could be.

37:19.982 --> 37:22.618
I don't think you're going to be
sweating the grave-robbing charge

37:22.652 --> 37:24.787
when you're doing twelve
years for extortion.

37:24.821 --> 37:26.589
<i>It would be wise
to drop this now.</i>

37:26.622 --> 37:28.624
And if you get the urge to email
me,

37:28.658 --> 37:31.027
I would advise against using the
computer at the library.

37:31.060 --> 37:32.061
Are we clear?

37:32.094 --> 37:33.696
Yes, ma'am.

37:33.729 --> 37:37.633
Then you have a wonderful day, Mr. X,
and you try to make some better decisions.

37:41.469 --> 37:42.337
Well?

37:43.639 --> 37:45.107
Her points were well-reasoned.

37:45.775 --> 37:46.809
Fuck.

37:50.746 --> 37:53.049
- I got it. The rich lady.
- What?

37:53.082 --> 37:56.652
Plan B. The rich lady who brought
him here in the first place!

37:56.686 --> 37:59.088
Perfect! I knew you'd come
up with something.

37:59.121 --> 38:02.091
Wait! We don't have to steal
another cell phone, do we?

38:02.124 --> 38:04.861
Nah, that was just because it
was a government agency.

38:04.894 --> 38:06.863
The phone booth at the gas
station will be fine.

38:06.896 --> 38:09.632
- We'll go right after work.
- I thought you were gonna see your dad.

38:09.665 --> 38:11.100
I can see him tomorrow.

38:11.133 --> 38:13.636
Oh, I don't know if
I'd skip that, Ruth.

38:15.171 --> 38:16.772
Next week?

38:16.806 --> 38:18.841
Two weeks at the most.

38:18.875 --> 38:22.745
Then I'll be home in
my own damn bed.

38:22.778 --> 38:25.815
That's amazing.
The tests all came out clean?

38:25.848 --> 38:27.382
Clean as a Dutch oven.

38:28.618 --> 38:32.955
Don't eat that shit, Ruthie!
That stuff is so bad for you.

38:32.989 --> 38:35.625
No it's not. It's fortified.

38:37.226 --> 38:38.761
That's great news, Dad.

38:38.794 --> 38:42.031
You know that Meg and Holly are
living with me now.

38:42.064 --> 38:44.934
- I don't know if I can just get them out.
- That's alright.

38:44.967 --> 38:47.703
The more the merrier as long as
they're clean.

38:47.737 --> 38:51.506
But we gotta keep all this
hush-hush, though.

38:52.041 --> 38:56.646
Zeblisky said if the hospice
people got wind of this,

38:56.679 --> 38:59.481
my insurance wouldn't pay for
the stay.

39:00.515 --> 39:01.717
I won't say a thing.

39:03.953 --> 39:06.589
Do you want me to see if I can get
Brownie back from the Nielsens?

39:06.622 --> 39:08.691
They don't really seem to
be dog people anyway.

39:08.724 --> 39:13.896
No no more dogs. I've had the
time to think about that here.

39:13.930 --> 39:16.564
I don't think old people
should have dogs.

39:16.599 --> 39:21.837
See, a dog would eat you if he could
figure out you were made of meat.

39:21.871 --> 39:26.508
So thank God they're morons.

39:27.509 --> 39:29.477
I need some time
to process this.

39:30.880 --> 39:33.916
Things don't turn out exactly
the way you think they will.

39:33.950 --> 39:38.721
Yeah... Different...
Different... Not all bad.

39:41.090 --> 39:43.859
You're starting to sound like a
glass-half-full kind of guy.

39:45.094 --> 39:46.528
Not really.

39:47.797 --> 39:50.032
It only seems fuller

39:50.066 --> 39:53.903
because the glass is a little
smaller these days.

40:05.948 --> 40:07.049
<i>Warren residence.</i>

40:07.083 --> 40:10.286
Hello, I would like to speak
with Mrs. Laura Warren.

40:10.319 --> 40:11.721
<i>Who's calling, please?</i>

40:11.754 --> 40:14.023
My name is... Deborah Gibson.

40:14.857 --> 40:17.293
And I am calling about a
gentleman friend of hers:

40:17.326 --> 40:18.928
President James Buchanan.

40:19.662 --> 40:20.796
<i>One moment, please.</i>

40:20.830 --> 40:22.031
He's getting her!

40:25.935 --> 40:27.603
<i>Are you from the newspaper?</i>

40:27.636 --> 40:30.106
<i>Do you wish to conduct an
interview with Mrs. Warren?</i>

40:30.806 --> 40:32.675
Uh, that's right, guy.

40:32.708 --> 40:33.776
An interview.

40:35.111 --> 40:38.014
<i>Mrs. Warren will be dining
at LeBaron's this evening.</i>

40:38.047 --> 40:39.949
<i>You can join her there
promptly at 7:30.</i>

40:39.982 --> 40:42.651
Oh, I don't know if that's something that... Hello?

40:47.056 --> 40:48.190
What happened?

40:48.224 --> 40:50.693
She wants to have dinner with me.
For an interview.

40:50.726 --> 40:52.628
Maybe that's a good thing.

40:52.661 --> 40:53.996
No way that's a good thing.

40:54.030 --> 40:56.265
No, this way you can see whether
she would even consider

40:56.298 --> 40:58.934
paying a ransom without actually
demanding it up front.

40:58.968 --> 41:02.638
And if she's not interested, well,
at least you got a free meal.

41:02.671 --> 41:03.939
She'll see right through me.

41:03.973 --> 41:06.642
No way! She's a rich widow.

41:06.675 --> 41:09.645
Reality to her is spending
thousands and thousands of dollars

41:09.678 --> 41:12.748
to dig up a dead guy and mail him across
the country to her doctor's house.

41:12.782 --> 41:14.984
She's fucking delusional,
just play along.

41:16.685 --> 41:19.955
...but his grandfather
didn't have the means to get it done.

41:19.989 --> 41:24.693
So I guess it was my uncle who first
got me interested in pursuing it.

41:25.327 --> 41:27.797
He had this long car.

41:27.830 --> 41:30.132
I tell you, it was the greatest
thing since funny milk!

41:31.267 --> 41:35.204
Anyway, so I... do you need to
change the tape out in that thing?

41:35.237 --> 41:38.741
It's fine. Like I said, it's
digital, so the tape's really small.

41:38.774 --> 41:43.779
Now, I touched on this earlier,
but maybe I wasn't being clear.

41:43.813 --> 41:45.848
It's about your investment
in this...

41:45.881 --> 41:49.718
Oh, the donations and the endowments I
had to make just to open the right doors.

41:49.752 --> 41:52.755
Plus the cost to ship a
fully-insured casket.

41:52.788 --> 41:54.223
That was
a requirement of the county.

41:54.256 --> 41:57.359
And the medical costs and
the procedures and...

41:57.393 --> 42:01.730
That's what I'm getting at. All the
costs to get him out here and everything.

42:01.764 --> 42:02.765
Well, I had to.

42:02.798 --> 42:05.201
There's only one doctor
in the country I trust.

42:05.234 --> 42:10.172
He happens to be my doctor and he wasn't
going to fly back East, which I can respect.

42:10.206 --> 42:12.675
While the results were
disappointing,

42:12.708 --> 42:16.345
I feel that ultimately it was
money well spent.

42:16.378 --> 42:18.280
That's what I'm getting
at: money well spent.

42:19.181 --> 42:23.152
You see, there's this other
person that I interviewed

42:23.185 --> 42:25.921
that says that the body was
never shipped back...

42:25.955 --> 42:27.189
That empty coffin
story is hogwash.

42:27.223 --> 42:30.392
I didn't pay same-day freight
just to ship back an empty box.

42:30.426 --> 42:32.728
The county and the cemetery
both confirmed...

42:32.761 --> 42:35.397
I happen to know it's
true, Mrs. Warren.

42:36.198 --> 42:37.601
And the person I interviewed

42:37.633 --> 42:42.438
said that they are willing to keep
this embarrassment on the down-low

42:42.471 --> 42:45.241
for a donation or
endowment.

42:47.309 --> 42:48.878
And just how much would that be?

42:48.911 --> 42:50.980
They say fifty thousand dollars.

42:52.114 --> 42:53.082
You don't believe me?

42:54.618 --> 42:57.887
It doesn't matter whether I believe
you, because it's none of my concern.

42:57.920 --> 42:59.989
DNA says he's no kin of mine.

43:00.022 --> 43:03.325
So you can just skedaddle along and
find someone else to shake down.

43:03.359 --> 43:04.793
I've washed my hands
of that man.

43:04.827 --> 43:08.230
But he was dug up because of you.
Don't you feel any responsibility?

43:08.264 --> 43:09.365
No, I do not.

43:09.398 --> 43:14.069
That H-O-M-O-sexual has been
hanging over my family

43:14.103 --> 43:16.138
like a vulture for the past
hundred years.

43:16.172 --> 43:17.273
It's embarrassing.

43:17.306 --> 43:19.942
Then why did you go through all
the trouble and expense?

43:19.975 --> 43:21.844
Well, he was president.

43:24.747 --> 43:28.117
Even the ugliest Osmond brother
is still an Osmond brother.

43:34.356 --> 43:35.424
Out of bounds.

43:36.992 --> 43:39.328
Whatever would lead her
to that conclusion?

43:39.361 --> 43:41.463
Well, for starters,
after you died,

43:41.497 --> 43:44.266
your niece and Mr. King's
niece made it a point

43:44.300 --> 43:46.869
of burning all of the letters
you two wrote to each other.

43:46.902 --> 43:47.903
Third down...

43:49.271 --> 43:51.040
There's nothing odd in that.

43:51.073 --> 43:53.375
- The letters were private.
- Hey, I'm not judging.

43:53.409 --> 43:56.946
It just makes it sound like they were
forbidden love letters between two dudes.

43:56.979 --> 43:59.348
Fourth down. I'm kicking
a field goal.

44:02.251 --> 44:04.987
Three points. Suck it, Buchanan!

44:05.020 --> 44:09.225
William Rufus King was a
wonderful companion.

44:09.258 --> 44:11.894
We had many interests in common.

44:11.927 --> 44:14.530
And you are judging,
Miss Kiesling.

44:14.563 --> 44:18.801
No, no you lived together
for thirteen years.

44:18.834 --> 44:21.170
You went to every
party together.

44:21.203 --> 44:25.174
You yourself called the relationship
a "communion", and... um...

44:25.207 --> 44:28.844
When he was sent to France on
some extended job,

44:28.877 --> 44:31.413
you wrote a letter to somebody
where you said...

44:32.147 --> 44:36.051
"I am alone and solitary in the
house, having no companion.

44:36.085 --> 44:40.956
I have gone a'wooing to several gentlemen
but have not succeeded with any of them."

44:42.958 --> 44:43.826
Yes?

44:43.859 --> 44:46.295
"Gone a'wooing to several
gentlemen?"

44:46.328 --> 44:48.897
It is a figure of speech!

44:48.931 --> 44:51.200
And Andrew Jackson used to
call you "Miss Nancy"...

44:51.233 --> 44:53.836
Andrew Jackson was a stool!

44:53.869 --> 44:55.170
It's right here in the book.

44:55.204 --> 44:59.808
This friend of yours, this Meg...

44:59.842 --> 45:02.544
how long have the two of you
been cohabitating?

45:02.579 --> 45:03.979
In this house?

45:04.013 --> 45:07.483
- Just under a year, after my father went...
- No, no, no. Before that.

45:07.516 --> 45:08.517
A while.

45:08.550 --> 45:13.188
And is your relationship
of a prurient nature?

45:13.222 --> 45:17.960
- Okay, I get it.
- So whether these rumors were true or untrue is irrelevant!

45:17.993 --> 45:23.098
It was hell bent conjecture of the first
order and absolutely none of their business!

45:23.132 --> 45:25.200
Neither is it any of yours!

45:33.008 --> 45:35.511
Look, I don't know how I
can make it any clearer.

45:35.544 --> 45:38.180
For forty thousand dollars
you can get him back.

45:38.213 --> 45:42.217
Ma'am, I hear what you're saying,
but James Buchanan is in his grave.

45:42.251 --> 45:43.852
"A'moulderin", as they say.

45:43.886 --> 45:48.190
But he's not a'moulderin', as I've said,
because you guys never reburied him!

45:48.223 --> 45:49.626
He's still here in Arizona!

45:49.659 --> 45:51.860
You guys buried an empty coffin!

45:51.894 --> 45:53.329
We buried an empty coffin?

45:54.496 --> 45:56.365
Not my problem in any way...

45:56.398 --> 45:57.933
You could lose a national
treasure!

45:57.966 --> 46:00.469
Uh, no not a national treasure.

46:00.502 --> 46:02.438
That's very historically
inaccurate.

46:02.471 --> 46:06.208
<i>They did like a ten-part series
on the presidents on PBS.</i>

46:06.241 --> 46:08.344
Washington got 19 minutes.

46:08.377 --> 46:11.146
Buchanan was in a montage
after Polk.

46:11.180 --> 46:15.484
Well, I'm sorry he's been such a wart
on the community's ass, but he's...

46:15.517 --> 46:17.886
No, he's one of the state's
biggest embarrassments

46:17.920 --> 46:21.123
and we had Three Mile Island and
game six of the '93 World Series.

46:21.156 --> 46:26.195
I'm sympathetic to all this town history,
so how about we slash that ransom?

46:26.228 --> 46:28.631
Thirty thousand dollars.
One president, priced to move!

46:28.665 --> 46:32.234
Ma'am, ma'am, we're not in the
business of buying dead bodies!

46:32.267 --> 46:34.903
I don't even know what line it
would go under the town budget!

46:34.937 --> 46:36.572
And then we gotta dig up the
coffin again

46:36.606 --> 46:38.608
and then we gotta
deal with the backhoe guy again

46:38.641 --> 46:40.309
and the backhoe guy is a real
prick!

46:40.342 --> 46:41.611
It's your town history!

46:41.644 --> 46:43.946
You can't just ignore one
of your own, can you?

46:43.979 --> 46:45.013
We don't ignore him.

46:45.047 --> 46:47.149
We sell T-shirts of him at
the City Hall Gift Shop.

46:47.182 --> 46:48.651
We don't move a lot of them.

46:48.685 --> 46:51.120
I think we've sold one since
I've been here

46:51.153 --> 46:54.189
and that was to some hipster guy
who was buying it ironically.

46:54.223 --> 46:59.962
No, he's not really a National
Treasure, he's more of a Town Character.

46:59.995 --> 47:02.431
You guys have Town Characters
out there, right?

47:02.464 --> 47:05.501
"Town Character" what the
hell is a Town Character?

47:05.534 --> 47:07.569
Look, is your supervisor there?

47:07.604 --> 47:09.672
We're gonna need to speak
to a higher authority.

47:09.706 --> 47:13.275
No. Yes, she is here, and no,
she will not speak to you.

47:13.308 --> 47:16.278
After dealing with Mrs.
Warren and her doctor and her accountant,

47:16.311 --> 47:19.448
she specifically said I was not
to take any calls from Arizona.

47:19.481 --> 47:21.483
Then why the hell did
you pick up my call?

47:21.517 --> 47:22.619
I didn't want to be snooty.

47:22.652 --> 47:26.155
I mean, after all, this is
Lancaster County not York.

47:26.188 --> 47:27.990
Good luck selling your
corpse, ma'am.

47:33.262 --> 47:35.063
Hey, how'd it go?

47:35.097 --> 47:38.100
They seem to be as interested
in Buchanan as everybody else.

47:38.133 --> 47:39.535
Oh, shit.

47:39.568 --> 47:42.571
I need a break. I'm gonna run home
and get that paperwork for Crosby.

47:42.605 --> 47:45.574
I promised I'd bring it by
yesterday. Can you cover?

47:45.608 --> 47:46.709
It'll just be a long lunch.

47:46.743 --> 47:50.112
- It's not even ten o'clock...
- An early, long lunch?

47:50.145 --> 47:54.149
Sure. Just gotta prep the lunch
counter by myself again...

48:03.358 --> 48:04.226
Hey.

48:08.665 --> 48:12.267
Hey, did you see a yellow paper
that was here, folded in half?

48:12.301 --> 48:13.435
Wouldn't know.

48:14.737 --> 48:16.038
Is everything alright?

48:16.071 --> 48:17.973
Yeah, everything's fine.

48:19.475 --> 48:22.110
Are you sure?
You seem upset about something.

48:22.144 --> 48:24.346
Well, let's see.
What should I be most upset about?

48:24.379 --> 48:27.282
The beads all over
the kitchen floor?

48:27.316 --> 48:29.218
The missing yellow
piece of paper?

48:29.251 --> 48:32.254
Or the rotting, presidential
corpse in our garage?

48:32.287 --> 48:35.157
Oh... that's James Buchanan.

48:35.190 --> 48:37.493
Yeah, I know who he is. I
introduced you, remember?

48:38.293 --> 48:40.162
Listen, Holly I'm
really sorry...

48:40.195 --> 48:41.698
I could lose my job over this!

48:42.498 --> 48:44.299
Why the hell did you steal him?

48:44.333 --> 48:45.668
And why did you do
it behind my back?

48:45.702 --> 48:47.770
- It was to keep you safe.
- You should have told me!

48:47.804 --> 48:50.038
You would have just tried
to talk me out of it.

48:50.072 --> 48:53.610
Yeah, yeah, I would have but if
you were still dead-set on it,

48:55.244 --> 48:56.345
I could have helped!

48:57.312 --> 48:59.348
Ten months behind?

48:59.381 --> 49:01.517
What have you been doing
with the rent I paid?

49:01.550 --> 49:05.220
I was paying back Mr. Lacey from
that night I smashed his car.

49:05.254 --> 49:06.589
Ninety-five hundred dollars.

49:06.623 --> 49:08.725
Well, you said you had
insurance to cover that.

49:08.758 --> 49:11.126
I didn't have insurance
at the time.

49:11.159 --> 49:12.795
I thought I did, but I didn't.

49:12.829 --> 49:15.097
No way you did ninety-five
hundred in damage.

49:15.130 --> 49:16.532
I know!

49:16.565 --> 49:20.469
But it was either that or he would
press charges, he said, so...

49:20.502 --> 49:23.238
Besides, I'd already broken
probation that one time.

49:23.272 --> 49:24.641
It would have been bad.

49:24.674 --> 49:26.743
He'll be paid off in
three more months.

49:26.776 --> 49:28.845
So you were just planning
to let the house go?

49:28.878 --> 49:31.714
No. My dad has some life
insurance,

49:31.748 --> 49:35.618
not a lot, but enough to take care
of the back payments, even now.

49:36.719 --> 49:40.790
Stupid me, I figured when someone goes into
hospice with less than a month to live,

49:40.823 --> 49:42.558
they're not going to last
almost a year.

49:42.592 --> 49:45.360
If that makes me a vulture,
then I'm a vulture.

49:47.262 --> 49:48.230
What a morning...

49:49.264 --> 49:50.465
What are you gonna do?

49:50.499 --> 49:52.467
I'm going to get that
yellow paper for Crosby.

49:52.501 --> 49:54.871
No I mean what are you going to
do about President Buchanan?

49:54.904 --> 49:58.206
Well, I'm working my way down the list.
Eventually, someone will care.

49:58.240 --> 50:00.442
Well, supposedly he
was gay, right?

50:01.176 --> 50:05.547
So... First of all, Holly, this
"friend" of yours.

50:06.214 --> 50:08.851
- Is it Ruth here?
- No, it isn't.

50:08.885 --> 50:12.855
It's another friend. One who's
clearly troubled.

50:12.889 --> 50:15.357
Okay. Holly, you
know I love you.

50:15.390 --> 50:17.060
You were my favorite babysitter.

50:17.092 --> 50:21.496
And I do see the benefit of all the positive
publicity we'd get by returning his body.

50:22.464 --> 50:24.266
But it's still a money thing.

50:24.299 --> 50:27.704
We're not GLAAD or some
big LGBTQ organization.

50:27.737 --> 50:29.104
We're college students.

50:29.137 --> 50:33.175
And gay students are exactly like
straight students. We're broke.

50:33.208 --> 50:35.778
Okay, spitball with me here
for a second, Wyatt.

50:35.812 --> 50:39.916
Do you think GLAAD would see
Buchanan as a homosexual icon?

50:39.949 --> 50:42.919
Not like a Judy Garland-level
icon,

50:42.952 --> 50:46.789
but more of a second or a third-tier
Charles Nelson Reilly-type?

50:46.823 --> 50:48.123
Hmmm.

50:48.156 --> 50:51.426
A guy who sympathized with slave-owners...
and might not be gay?

50:52.227 --> 50:54.563
I don't think that's in line
with GLAAD's mission statement.

50:55.698 --> 50:58.166
So gays feel that,
as a president...

50:58.200 --> 51:00.268
...that he was the
shittiest one. Well...

51:00.970 --> 51:02.839
Another example of
our common ground.

51:05.942 --> 51:07.409
Oh please, dig in.

51:11.380 --> 51:12.314
Mmm.

51:13.315 --> 51:15.183
Oh. Thanks.

51:16.953 --> 51:18.888
How long have you been working
at this donut shop?

51:18.921 --> 51:20.657
- Two, three months?
- Four months.

51:21.356 --> 51:23.258
- Long stretch for me.
- Really?

51:23.291 --> 51:25.260
What's the longest you've
ever worked at one place?

51:25.293 --> 51:27.897
I worked at my dad's store on and off
for years all through high school.

51:27.930 --> 51:30.399
- Your dad owned a store?
- Yeah. It's still there.

51:30.432 --> 51:33.502
My dad's asshole partner screwed him over
and took the store a while back, but...

51:34.302 --> 51:36.371
It's out there in Mesa.
Utopia TV and Appliance.

51:36.405 --> 51:38.708
I know that place.
I bought a dishwasher there.

51:38.741 --> 51:40.509
Used to be called Ruth's
TV and Appliance.

51:41.376 --> 51:43.713
But I racked up a few
disappointments

51:43.746 --> 51:46.916
and my dad decided that my name wasn't
worthy of an appliance store, so...

51:46.949 --> 51:48.751
He renamed it "Utopia".

51:48.785 --> 51:52.989
Kept the "U" and the "T" from Ruth, saved some
money. So half of my name is still up there.

51:53.022 --> 51:55.357
And you can see the outline of
where the "R" used to be.

51:55.390 --> 51:56.693
That must have hurt.

51:56.726 --> 51:59.227
Nah, just an appliance store.

52:00.930 --> 52:04.533
You know, I watched a couple of
those ventriloquist videos of yours.

52:04.566 --> 52:06.703
And while I still think I'm
missing out on the joke,

52:07.937 --> 52:09.706
I really enjoyed your
cello-playing.

52:09.739 --> 52:11.373
Really nice.

52:11.406 --> 52:12.474
I'm pretty rusty, though.

52:12.507 --> 52:13.843
How long have you been playing?

52:13.876 --> 52:15.477
Since high school.

52:15.510 --> 52:19.649
Actually, I played violin in middle
school and the first chunk of high school.

52:20.549 --> 52:23.351
My dad wanted us to be musical.
Me and my brother, Brad.

52:23.385 --> 52:24.854
I didn't know you had a brother.

52:24.887 --> 52:30.459
Yeah, so when he stopped
playing cello, I picked it up.

52:30.492 --> 52:31.393
Switched over.

52:32.527 --> 52:33.629
How come?

52:33.663 --> 52:36.465
Oh, just got tired of playing
the melody all the time.

52:46.374 --> 52:47.176
Ruth?

52:47.210 --> 52:49.045
Hey, Trina what are
you doing here?

52:49.078 --> 52:51.379
I know someone who works in the
building. How about you?

52:51.413 --> 52:53.448
I was just seeing my
probation officer.

52:53.482 --> 52:55.585
Oh, we're being honest.

52:56.018 --> 52:58.855
I'm here to see my P.O.,
too. Have you got Crosby?

52:58.888 --> 53:00.422
Yup, that's him.

53:01.958 --> 53:06.528
Hey, Trina, just out of curiosity,
what exactly did you get in trouble for?

53:06.561 --> 53:08.898
Me and a couple of others tried
to break into a house.

53:08.931 --> 53:10.733
Cop lived across the street.

53:10.767 --> 53:11.634
You?

53:12.835 --> 53:16.906
A little theft, a little anger,
borrowed a car, you know.

53:18.340 --> 53:19.041
Hey, um...

53:19.876 --> 53:21.309
I got something pretty valuable

53:21.343 --> 53:25.014
that I'm having a hard time finding
an interested party to... um...

53:25.848 --> 53:27.784
So you're looking for a fence?

53:27.817 --> 53:28.851
I guess so.

53:28.885 --> 53:31.053
But it's kind of
a specialty item.

53:32.054 --> 53:34.322
I know a guy. What do you got?

53:35.057 --> 53:38.060
An agent to do your dirty work?

53:39.427 --> 53:41.463
It will go no easier on you,
Miss Kiesling,

53:41.496 --> 53:45.034
by adding delegation of personal
responsibility

53:45.067 --> 53:47.536
to your list of
moral lapses.

53:48.704 --> 53:51.774
I'm just trying to cover more
territory, J.B. It's called networking.

53:53.142 --> 53:56.444
And in so doing, you have
crossed a troubling line.

53:56.478 --> 53:57.980
What troubling line?

53:58.014 --> 54:02.885
Your original proposal was to ask for
money in exchange for my safe return,

54:02.919 --> 54:07.623
the end result being the peaceful
restoration of my eternal slumber.

54:07.657 --> 54:12.595
And this required a nominal equality
of purpose from both parties, yes?

54:13.528 --> 54:18.500
Now you're simply trying to sell me to anyone
who'll take this random object off your hands.

54:18.533 --> 54:21.871
There no longer exists even
a pretense of concern.

54:22.571 --> 54:28.010
In so doing, you have stepped out of the
protective shadow of your own rationalization.

54:28.044 --> 54:30.112
I tried the other way first.

54:30.146 --> 54:32.815
You're a really specific
commodity, dude!

54:32.849 --> 54:35.017
What can I do? I've already
started down this path.

54:35.051 --> 54:38.955
You knew it was a risky
path when you chose it.

54:38.988 --> 54:42.992
But you knew it was irreversibly
perilous

54:43.025 --> 54:45.127
the moment you spoke
to that woman in Washington.

54:45.928 --> 54:47.495
Why do you persist?

54:47.529 --> 54:48.831
I'm persistent.

54:50.498 --> 54:52.802
An author I'm acquainted with
once wrote:

54:52.835 --> 54:57.439
"Foolish consistency is the
hobgoblin of little minds."

54:58.074 --> 55:01.543
- Have you ever heard this quotation?
- Yeah, I've heard it.

55:01.577 --> 55:03.746
Have you ever considered
what it means?

55:03.779 --> 55:07.549
Not really. I could never get
past the word "hobgoblin."

55:15.925 --> 55:16.893
Hello?

55:20.462 --> 55:22.430
- Surprised?
- Yeah.

55:24.166 --> 55:26.869
- When Trina told me she knew a guy, I figured it would be...
- Someone less refined?

55:26.903 --> 55:28.905
I know, I'm a difficult read.

55:29.705 --> 55:32.174
Ruth, do you know what I thought
the very first time I saw you?

55:32.208 --> 55:33.075
Yes.

55:34.777 --> 55:36.178
I mean after that.

55:36.212 --> 55:40.482
Before I ever heard you play a note,
I thought, "Here is an artist".

55:41.217 --> 55:44.887
And an artistic life demands certain
sacrifices from the world at-large.

55:44.921 --> 55:47.757
Certain social niceties might
have to fall by the wayside...

55:47.790 --> 55:49.158
Hey I'm not a bad person.

55:49.191 --> 55:52.895
- No, no, I was putting an ironic twist.
- I'm a fucking organ donor!

55:53.629 --> 55:57.465
Ruth, I've heard stories
about your partying past.

55:57.499 --> 55:59.501
Nobody wants those kidneys.

55:59.534 --> 56:01.737
Well, I'm taking those
off the table.

56:02.204 --> 56:04.040
I think I can move
your president.

56:04.073 --> 56:05.741
My end is seventy percent.

56:05.775 --> 56:06.676
Firm.

56:07.710 --> 56:10.846
Well, the truth is, I don't
have him anymore.

56:10.880 --> 56:12.748
Sold him this afternoon.

56:12.782 --> 56:13.649
To whom?

56:18.154 --> 56:20.189
Okay, keep it to yourself.

56:20.222 --> 56:23.059
I just thought I might be able
to help a fellow artist.

56:31.767 --> 56:34.837
Ahh, a student of history.

56:35.570 --> 56:36.538
Not really.

56:37.974 --> 56:41.043
I only know a handful of these guys,
the ones with the cool nicknames.

56:42.144 --> 56:44.914
"Old Hickory," "Old Rough
and Ready," "Old...

56:44.947 --> 56:48.718
...Scratch and Sniff".
It's been a while.

56:49.919 --> 56:51.519
I don't think I know
your nickname.

56:52.321 --> 56:54.890
"Old Public Functionary."

56:55.992 --> 56:59.962
"Old Public Functionary"?
Jesus...

57:00.763 --> 57:05.234
So the presidents themselves
weren't very important?

57:05.267 --> 57:08.304
No. What's important to
me is what they stand on.

57:08.337 --> 57:10.639
Ahh, their principles.

57:10.673 --> 57:13.609
No, the wooden thing
that they stand on.

57:14.243 --> 57:15.945
My brother made it in woodshop.

57:15.978 --> 57:20.149
He got a "C" because he didn't do the joints
right and had to use a staple gun, but...

57:20.182 --> 57:25.121
If the teacher had seen the original piece-of-shit
Styrofoam display thingy this replaced,

57:25.154 --> 57:26.322
he would have gotten an "A."

57:26.355 --> 57:30.726
That's not a metaphor for Mr.
Lincoln and myself, is it?

57:30.760 --> 57:32.728
Nah, that's just woodshop.

57:34.296 --> 57:38.134
Oh, look at this.

57:38.934 --> 57:41.270
Sloppy craftsmanship.

57:41.303 --> 57:42.638
I have no ears.

57:42.671 --> 57:46.108
- I look like a...
- Like a maltreated strip of buckskin shoelace?

57:47.610 --> 57:48.944
Is that a metaphor?

57:48.978 --> 57:51.647
No, just a dick joke.

57:54.850 --> 57:56.719
I'm gonna return your
corpse tomorrow.

57:57.219 --> 57:58.187
No ransom.

57:59.822 --> 58:00.723
Thank you.

58:04.293 --> 58:06.295
What do you mean,
they "found him"?

58:06.328 --> 58:07.897
Who found him? And where?

58:07.930 --> 58:09.365
We promised we wouldn't tell.

58:09.398 --> 58:12.768
We could only get the body back if
we swore we wouldn't say anything.

58:12.802 --> 58:15.738
I wasn't for sure that he had
been taken, but I suspected.

58:15.771 --> 58:19.075
After the truck left, I found
this on the floor...

58:19.108 --> 58:20.843
About soiled my pants.

58:20.876 --> 58:21.944
So who took him?

58:21.977 --> 58:25.714
We're not at liberty to say
whether this person...

58:25.748 --> 58:29.952
is a thief, or just... found the
body in the woods.

58:29.985 --> 58:31.687
You have him here with
you, don't you?

58:31.720 --> 58:32.822
Yeah.

58:33.923 --> 58:35.891
Look, I can't help you!

58:35.925 --> 58:39.662
I like you, Holly, and you two
seem like nice enough people.

58:39.695 --> 58:41.097
But my job is on the line here!

58:41.130 --> 58:44.133
Can't you just fly him back to
Pennsylvania anonymously or something?

58:44.166 --> 58:48.904
As far as anyone who cares is concerned
Mr. Buchanan has already been shipped back...

58:49.905 --> 58:51.740
You see this bill
of lading here?

58:51.774 --> 58:55.778
It clearly shows that Mr. Buchanan
was shipped back on the twelfth.

58:55.811 --> 58:59.748
Note that the weight listed here,
which was accurate on the eleventh,

58:59.782 --> 59:03.752
is identical to the freight receipt
that I signed back on the sixth.

59:03.786 --> 59:08.858
From a paperwork standpoint, Mr. Buchanan has
been shipped back to eternity in triplicate!

59:08.891 --> 59:13.362
I'm not normally as touchy as this so it
pains me to say this: Ladies, please...

59:13.395 --> 59:18.667
Take your douchebag president and remove
yourselves from my logistics cubicle.

59:30.980 --> 59:33.015
We'll get you back underground
somehow.

59:33.048 --> 59:34.150
I know.

59:34.183 --> 59:35.918
You're persistent.

59:37.419 --> 59:40.189
What will you do now
to obtain the money?

59:41.056 --> 59:42.658
Just tell Dad.

59:44.093 --> 59:46.262
I'm gonna tell my dad everything
after work, and let the chips fall.

59:47.062 --> 59:51.200
Well, humility is a
fine virtue, yes?

59:55.771 --> 59:58.207
Hey, I don't mean to
interrupt the flow.

59:58.240 --> 01:00:00.910
I just thought I'd finally come
by and check this place out.

01:00:00.943 --> 01:00:02.711
Hey, it's a free country.

01:00:02.745 --> 01:00:05.181
Besides, I have something
I need to tell you.

01:00:05.214 --> 01:00:06.949
You might even be proud of me.

01:00:08.817 --> 01:00:10.152
Is this a joke?

01:00:10.186 --> 01:00:11.887
Are you trying to prank me?

01:00:11.921 --> 01:00:14.323
Please tell me this is just
some form of pranksmanship.

01:00:14.356 --> 01:00:16.158
Okay, I know the first part was
bad,

01:00:16.192 --> 01:00:19.161
but you understand I'm trying
to return him to Pennsylvania

01:00:19.195 --> 01:00:20.729
for zero profit, right?

01:00:20.763 --> 01:00:23.899
Okay, I'll grant you that part
is somewhat admirable.

01:00:23.933 --> 01:00:26.001
But you stole a human being!

01:00:26.035 --> 01:00:27.436
A dead one.

01:00:27.469 --> 01:00:29.972
The rules are wildly different.

01:00:30.005 --> 01:00:31.373
I've had this debate before.

01:00:31.407 --> 01:00:33.909
But why would it even occur
to you to take him?

01:00:33.943 --> 01:00:36.111
That's something a child does.

01:00:36.145 --> 01:00:39.215
This is just like the time when you stole
that fancy car from that gas station...

01:00:39.248 --> 01:00:41.150
I didn't steal that car!

01:00:41.183 --> 01:00:44.320
That guy left it running.
It's just as much his fault as it is mine!

01:00:44.353 --> 01:00:46.222
You're so much smarter
than this, Ruth.

01:00:46.255 --> 01:00:48.791
But you just don't think
things through!

01:00:48.824 --> 01:00:51.293
You're not listening!
I did think it through.

01:00:51.327 --> 01:00:54.096
It might have started out as
impulsive, but cooler heads prevailed!

01:00:54.129 --> 01:00:55.764
Cooler heads!

01:00:56.432 --> 01:00:57.333
Hello?

01:00:57.366 --> 01:00:58.968
I thought you'd be proud of me.

01:00:59.001 --> 01:01:00.102
Proud...?

01:01:00.135 --> 01:01:01.036
Ruth...

01:01:03.505 --> 01:01:04.974
Yeah, proud.

01:01:05.007 --> 01:01:06.842
I did the right thing
for a change.

01:01:13.282 --> 01:01:14.149
Hello?

01:01:19.054 --> 01:01:20.022
What's going on?

01:01:21.156 --> 01:01:24.093
Oh. Just having a
little off-day.

01:01:24.126 --> 01:01:26.428
What about the tests? You said
the doctors were amazed.

01:01:26.462 --> 01:01:31.267
Well, there may have been a
little embroidery on my part.

01:01:37.406 --> 01:01:38.907
It's not fair.

01:01:39.609 --> 01:01:40.976
It never is.

01:01:42.478 --> 01:01:44.413
Classic example:

01:01:44.446 --> 01:01:46.282
You remember Jerry Fleming?

01:01:46.315 --> 01:01:49.418
Jerry and his cousin go to
China.

01:01:50.152 --> 01:01:53.255
Cousin gets eaten by a
panda.

01:01:53.289 --> 01:01:56.525
It took Jerry years to
save for that trip!

01:01:57.293 --> 01:01:58.327
A panda?

01:01:58.360 --> 01:01:59.895
Well, they are bears, you know.

01:01:59.928 --> 01:02:01.864
But I thought pandas
only ate bamboo.

01:02:01.897 --> 01:02:03.432
Well, something must
have changed them.

01:02:03.465 --> 01:02:08.170
Or maybe he was an iconoclast.
You never can tell about bears.

01:02:10.607 --> 01:02:12.041
Why didn't you tell me?

01:02:12.074 --> 01:02:13.610
I was already preparing myself.

01:02:13.643 --> 01:02:16.512
Wait, why am I the bad guy here?

01:02:17.212 --> 01:02:18.914
I'm the one dying.

01:02:18.947 --> 01:02:21.817
Why do I have to make everyone
feel comfortable?

01:02:22.318 --> 01:02:24.920
What the hell kind of a
send-off is that?

01:02:25.554 --> 01:02:29.325
So I say a few magic words

01:02:29.358 --> 01:02:33.962
and everybody leaves the room a
little happier than when they came in.

01:02:33.996 --> 01:02:35.831
I mean, is that so bad?

01:02:36.565 --> 01:02:38.601
It just makes it harder
when you go.

01:02:38.635 --> 01:02:41.403
Well, that's too
bad. You'll live.

01:02:46.576 --> 01:02:48.010
I don't actually have a kid.

01:02:49.978 --> 01:02:51.046
I know.

01:02:51.581 --> 01:02:52.649
You know?

01:02:52.682 --> 01:02:55.484
I'm dying, but I'm not blind.

01:02:56.285 --> 01:03:01.123
I mean... kids change but they
don't change in other kids.

01:03:02.659 --> 01:03:04.226
Why didn't you say something?

01:03:04.259 --> 01:03:10.065
Well, you seemed so happy that I passed
away knowing the good family name was...

01:03:10.966 --> 01:03:15.104
It wasn't fair of me
to put that on you.

01:03:16.105 --> 01:03:18.407
It was fun watching
you with that kid.

01:03:19.475 --> 01:03:25.080
What was his name, the main
kid, was it "Kyle?"

01:03:25.114 --> 01:03:26.148
Jeffrey.

01:03:26.181 --> 01:03:27.483
He was a nice kid.

01:03:28.651 --> 01:03:31.553
There's no Grant either,
I suppose.

01:03:31.588 --> 01:03:32.454
No.

01:03:33.288 --> 01:03:34.189
Just as well.

01:03:35.224 --> 01:03:37.526
That little prick was
too good to be true.

01:03:38.494 --> 01:03:41.497
Made the rest of us sound
like goddamn assholes.

01:03:45.167 --> 01:03:46.201
There's more.

01:03:46.736 --> 01:03:48.137
It's about the house...

01:03:48.170 --> 01:03:50.005
If it's all the same to you,
Ruthie,

01:03:51.006 --> 01:03:54.677
I'd like to leave all
the confessions right there.

01:05:00.175 --> 01:05:03.011
Ah!
Jesus, Kiesling! What the hell?

01:05:03.045 --> 01:05:04.246
I thought you were a burglar.

01:05:04.279 --> 01:05:06.081
Somebody broke into
my bedroom window.

01:05:06.114 --> 01:05:06.982
What?

01:05:16.593 --> 01:05:19.729
You know, this oar would
make an awesome weapon.

01:05:20.395 --> 01:05:22.564
Have to trim off the
flat part, though.

01:05:23.633 --> 01:05:25.133
Then it would be a stick.

01:05:25.167 --> 01:05:28.303
Still, make a great
new murder weapon.

01:05:28.337 --> 01:05:30.372
Stick murder has been
around for years.

01:05:32.441 --> 01:05:34.777
Well, if it was a burglar, I
kind of feel sorry for him.

01:05:34.811 --> 01:05:36.378
Not much here to burgle.

01:05:36.411 --> 01:05:37.312
Yeah.

01:05:38.882 --> 01:05:42.652
The only things that are burgle-worthy
are your laptop and the Blu-Ray player.

01:05:44.687 --> 01:05:45.788
Oh, shit...

01:05:47.155 --> 01:05:50.425
Errol? That stupid
ventriloquist?

01:05:50.459 --> 01:05:51.828
He's also kind of a criminal.

01:05:51.861 --> 01:05:56.532
So you told Trina, and Trina told
Errol that Buchanan was for sale?

01:05:57.332 --> 01:05:59.301
Yes, but I didn't sell him.

01:05:59.334 --> 01:06:03.071
Wait, if Errol got Buchanan,
how was he gonna to get back to his grave?

01:06:03.105 --> 01:06:05.374
I don't think that was
a part of Errol's plan.

01:06:05.407 --> 01:06:07.010
I think he would
just resell him.

01:06:07.042 --> 01:06:11.313
What about the whole millhouse-on-the-river
plan with the water going to the sea?

01:06:11.346 --> 01:06:12.849
But I said, "No."

01:06:12.882 --> 01:06:14.851
Yeah, but I'm a part of this, too!
Don't I get a vote?

01:06:14.884 --> 01:06:16.318
I wasn't thinking.

01:06:16.351 --> 01:06:17.152
No duh!

01:06:17.185 --> 01:06:19.187
It was a shitty thing
to do, Ruth.

01:06:27.730 --> 01:06:30.365
I should have never introduced
you to him in the first place.

01:06:30.399 --> 01:06:32.167
I don't know why I'm
surprised it's Errol.

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:33.603
Typical Capricorn shit.

01:06:33.636 --> 01:06:35.337
My ex was a Capricorn, too.

01:06:35.370 --> 01:06:38.608
So was my cousin who watched my
bird one summer. Never fed it.

01:06:38.641 --> 01:06:42.311
You know, except for Jesus, all
Capricorns are buttholes.

01:06:42.344 --> 01:06:45.582
Hey, check this out.
Looks like there were three of them.

01:06:45.615 --> 01:06:47.382
Those are probably our prints.

01:06:47.416 --> 01:06:49.619
No, seriously then what is that?

01:06:52.154 --> 01:06:53.555
Looks like a tiny little hand.

01:06:54.591 --> 01:06:56.491
It's a dummy print.

01:06:56.525 --> 01:06:58.226
Fucking ventriloquists!

01:06:58.260 --> 01:06:59.762
"Dummy print?"
Is that even a term?

01:07:00.529 --> 01:07:02.765
For a second there, I thought
the burglar was a Hobbit!

01:07:02.799 --> 01:07:06.101
Wait not a Hobbit...
what am I thinking of, a midget. A midget!

01:07:06.669 --> 01:07:07.870
Don't use the "M"-word.

01:07:07.904 --> 01:07:10.907
- What?
- The "M"-word is like the "N"-word to little people.

01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:12.675
There's no such
thing as "midgets."

01:07:12.709 --> 01:07:14.611
"No such thing"? You're
thinking of Hobbits.

01:07:14.644 --> 01:07:16.713
No, my cousin is
a little person.

01:07:16.746 --> 01:07:20.382
Not quite a dwarf exactly, but he
had that thing that Gary Coleman had.

01:07:20.415 --> 01:07:21.450
Bad management?

01:07:21.483 --> 01:07:23.352
Okay, can we focus here, people?

01:07:23.385 --> 01:07:25.688
Ventriloquists have stolen
our dead president.

01:07:25.722 --> 01:07:27.422
What do we propose
to do about it?

01:07:27.456 --> 01:07:29.926
Okay when's the next time
you're gonna see Errol?

01:07:29.959 --> 01:07:31.293
Well, I was gonna see him
tomorrow

01:07:31.326 --> 01:07:34.864
- at the Willie Tyler birthday luncheon at Sunny's but...
- Who?

01:07:34.897 --> 01:07:36.866
You know, Willie
Tyler and Lester.

01:07:36.899 --> 01:07:40.435
It's a pretty big deal on the
ventriloquial social calendar.

01:07:40.469 --> 01:07:43.673
But Errol put me on
probation. Can't go.

01:07:43.706 --> 01:07:45.574
You're on probation?
Why? Because of Buchanan?

01:07:45.608 --> 01:07:47.442
I don't know.
He never tells you.

01:07:47.476 --> 01:07:48.678
I got a text.

01:07:48.711 --> 01:07:50.580
Well, let's just find out.

01:07:50.613 --> 01:07:53.883
No, no, no! He'll just get angry, Seriously...

01:07:53.916 --> 01:07:56.451
- Okay, don't answer!
- Hello?

01:07:59.254 --> 01:08:01.858
<i>One can never be
certain of legacy.</i>

01:08:02.625 --> 01:08:07.262
<i>You'd think that what one is remembered
for would be simple to gauge.</i>

01:08:07.897 --> 01:08:10.833
<i>You and I both share the
unenviable position</i>

01:08:10.867 --> 01:08:14.704
<i>of being the last branch on the
family tree but, strangely,</i>

01:08:14.737 --> 01:08:18.473
<i>that doesn't seem to lessen the
importance of legacy.</i>

01:08:19.474 --> 01:08:24.714
<i>My own would have been secured in a positive
light had I not stood as President.</i>

01:08:25.682 --> 01:08:28.283
<i>As Secretary of State under
President Polk</i>

01:08:28.316 --> 01:08:31.688
<i>I added over a million square
miles to this country.</i>

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:36.826
<i>This very piece of ground we're
on was secured under my watch...</i>

01:08:36.859 --> 01:08:40.462
Few have served their government
with distinction

01:08:40.495 --> 01:08:43.666
in more varied
capacity than I.

01:08:44.867 --> 01:08:48.303
My pursuit of the office of
Chief Executive

01:08:48.336 --> 01:08:53.810
was predicated solely on the
enormous expectations I'd nurtured.

01:08:55.377 --> 01:08:58.715
And had it not been for the
secession of the South

01:08:59.548 --> 01:09:02.752
which I was legally powerless to
stop, I...

01:09:02.785 --> 01:09:06.254
That's not true.
You just... Sorry.

01:09:07.857 --> 01:09:11.761
And so I was carried
one station too high.

01:09:13.328 --> 01:09:16.599
The greater responsibility left
me a lesser man

01:09:17.834 --> 01:09:20.837
because I gave
in to a sense of destiny.

01:09:23.305 --> 01:09:24.640
Maybe that's everybody.

01:09:25.975 --> 01:09:27.910
In high school, I was a
different person.

01:09:28.678 --> 01:09:32.413
Good grades, bunch of friends,
decent attitude for a teenager.

01:09:33.582 --> 01:09:34.951
And then Brad died.

01:09:34.984 --> 01:09:36.786
And then my mom freaked out.

01:09:38.888 --> 01:09:41.624
Everything went to shit and I
was powerless to stop it.

01:09:42.491 --> 01:09:44.594
It felt like half my
life was ripped away.

01:09:47.964 --> 01:09:53.401
If I could choose my legacy, I'd want
it to be for being that earlier girl.

01:09:56.105 --> 01:09:58.908
It's like my dad putting my
name on that appliance store.

01:09:59.809 --> 01:10:03.613
He couldn't hand me my legacy any more than
I could hand him his by getting knocked up.

01:10:06.749 --> 01:10:09.619
Kinda feel like my destiny's
gotten away from me, too.

01:10:17.026 --> 01:10:18.828
You doing okay, Ruth?

01:10:18.861 --> 01:10:20.062
Yeah, I guess.

01:10:20.096 --> 01:10:22.031
Want to go out, get some coffee?

01:10:22.064 --> 01:10:24.466
Nah thanks, though.

01:10:25.802 --> 01:10:29.005
Just need a little alone time.

01:10:29.772 --> 01:10:33.375
Okay, we're out here
if you need anything.

01:10:34.577 --> 01:10:35.578
Thanks.

01:10:42.919 --> 01:10:46.889
It's going to break my heart to
see you go to prison over me.

01:10:49.859 --> 01:10:50.726
Thanks.

01:10:55.530 --> 01:10:56.899
I'm a little tired.

01:11:02.038 --> 01:11:02.905
Me, too.

01:11:05.641 --> 01:11:07.509
Just take as much time
as you need, Ruth.

01:11:07.542 --> 01:11:09.645
Gunderson would have to be a
grade-A thunder stump

01:11:09.679 --> 01:11:11.546
to complain about taking time
off now.

01:11:12.048 --> 01:11:14.050
Just tell him it's
for bereavement.

01:11:18.453 --> 01:11:19.722
"Vaginal bereavement?"

01:11:23.893 --> 01:11:25.795
Ruth, what brings you here?

01:11:25.828 --> 01:11:27.362
A couple of dead people.

01:11:28.563 --> 01:11:30.099
Listen, I want to apologize for
yesterday

01:11:30.132 --> 01:11:32.869
but I've got a credit card fraud
due here in five minutes, so...

01:11:32.902 --> 01:11:34.337
He's gonna have to wait.
I need your help.

01:11:34.369 --> 01:11:37.539
And don't get upset, there's gonna
be plenty of time for that later.

01:11:39.842 --> 01:11:42.945
<i>The only surprising thing is what
he wanted me to do with his ashes...</i>

01:11:43.713 --> 01:11:47.482
He wanted me to sprinkle some
on Brad's grave, and some on my mom's.

01:11:48.084 --> 01:11:49.585
But then he also said...

01:11:51.821 --> 01:11:54.857
"By means of an epoxy to apply a
portion of my ashes

01:11:54.891 --> 01:11:57.459
to the
entire surface of a large rock

01:11:57.492 --> 01:12:00.562
and hurl it through the front
window of Utopia TV and Appliance."

01:12:02.131 --> 01:12:04.600
Didn't know you could put shit
like that in a legal document.

01:12:06.568 --> 01:12:09.939
Thanks. And can you tell Holly thanks
again for calling those mortgage people?

01:12:09.972 --> 01:12:11.073
That's a huge relief.

01:12:12.642 --> 01:12:14.877
...okay, bye.

01:12:32.995 --> 01:12:34.630
Errol wants to see you.

01:12:34.664 --> 01:12:37.667
- Now? How come?
- He said you'd know.

01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:40.703
- Besides, it's Willie Tyler's birthday.
- And Lester.

01:12:40.736 --> 01:12:43.471
Yeah, I know.
What if I refuse?

01:12:43.505 --> 01:12:44.674
You gonna force me?

01:12:44.707 --> 01:12:46.208
Well, that all depends.

01:12:46.242 --> 01:12:47.610
Depends on what?

01:12:47.643 --> 01:12:48.644
It depends on...

01:12:50.179 --> 01:12:53.582
What I mean is, we can
do this the hard way...

01:12:53.616 --> 01:12:54.951
...or the easy way.

01:12:55.851 --> 01:12:57.853
So which way is it going
to be, cellist?

01:12:57.887 --> 01:12:58.888
The easy way or the hard...

01:12:58.921 --> 01:13:02.058
Okay. I remember the two
choices, muttonchops.

01:13:08.164 --> 01:13:11.233
Well, Ruth, so glad
you could make it.

01:13:12.034 --> 01:13:15.104
I understand that you have
recently acquired a vintage figure.

01:13:15.137 --> 01:13:16.706
I did indeed.

01:13:17.173 --> 01:13:18.274
It's in pretty rough shape.

01:13:18.307 --> 01:13:21.243
I happen to know the original
owner of that figure.

01:13:21.277 --> 01:13:24.613
If you were smart, you would
return him right now.

01:13:24.647 --> 01:13:26.082
It's very valuable.

01:13:26.115 --> 01:13:28.651
I don't think I could
let it go so easily.

01:13:28.684 --> 01:13:30.953
In fact, I may have found an
interested buyer,

01:13:31.687 --> 01:13:34.090
something you were having
trouble doing, I understand.

01:13:34.123 --> 01:13:35.124
He's not for sale.

01:13:35.157 --> 01:13:36.926
To anyone.

01:13:36.959 --> 01:13:40.763
I know you can be trusted to keep quiet about
Mr. Buchanan purely out of self-preservation.

01:13:41.230 --> 01:13:47.003
But in order to heal this rift between
us, I'm willing to offer an olive branch:

01:13:47.670 --> 01:13:49.905
You can retain your position in
the videos

01:13:49.939 --> 01:13:53.175
and your roommate's probation is lifted
and she can rejoin the consortium.

01:13:54.076 --> 01:13:55.845
And what would you want
from me in return?

01:13:55.878 --> 01:13:57.980
Forget about Mr. Buchanan.

01:13:58.014 --> 01:13:59.982
And play the damn cello.

01:14:00.683 --> 01:14:02.284
And what if I don't
go along with that?

01:14:03.652 --> 01:14:04.920
Then the chairs are
on the table.

01:14:04.954 --> 01:14:06.856
What the hell's that
supposed to mean?

01:14:06.889 --> 01:14:09.091
It means the chairs
are on the table.

01:14:13.029 --> 01:14:14.864
Give me that fucking president!

01:14:16.165 --> 01:14:17.565
Is everything okay?

01:14:19.168 --> 01:14:21.003
Some water when you
get a chance?

01:14:34.683 --> 01:14:36.252
Fucking ventriloquists!

01:14:40.356 --> 01:14:41.657
Listen, Ruth.

01:14:41.690 --> 01:14:43.626
You don't want to
mess with Errol.

01:14:43.659 --> 01:14:48.097
Occasionally, he's a decent
guy, but he's amoral.

01:14:48.130 --> 01:14:49.564
You know what amoral
means, right?

01:14:50.266 --> 01:14:52.368
Of course I know what
amoral means!

01:14:52.401 --> 01:14:54.804
Sorry. Don't jump
down my throat.

01:14:54.837 --> 01:14:56.205
We don't talk much.

01:14:56.238 --> 01:14:59.608
And you're a 40-year-old grave-robber
that works in a donut shop.

01:14:59.642 --> 01:15:01.677
How am I supposed to know
you're not a simpleton?

01:15:02.645 --> 01:15:03.879
I didn't mean to snap.

01:15:03.913 --> 01:15:08.084
And I hate to judge, but he's
not even a good ventriloquist.

01:15:08.117 --> 01:15:09.685
Then why do you all follow him?

01:15:09.718 --> 01:15:11.854
Probably the same reason you do:

01:15:11.887 --> 01:15:16.292
He makes us feel talented or at least
like we're not wasting our time.

01:15:16.325 --> 01:15:18.894
But that does not mean
he's not dangerous.

01:15:18.928 --> 01:15:20.463
Here's how I see it:

01:15:20.496 --> 01:15:24.300
Errol's the type of guy you go to lunch
with and he's gonna ask for your pickle.

01:15:24.333 --> 01:15:27.970
And whether or not you have a pickle,
he's gonna get a pickle out of you.

01:15:28.871 --> 01:15:30.706
But it won't always
be like that.

01:15:30.739 --> 01:15:32.174
Things have already
started buckling.

01:15:32.208 --> 01:15:35.077
If you keep your eye on
it, you'll see it, too.

01:15:37.313 --> 01:15:38.948
Not sure I got the
pickle thing...

01:15:52.361 --> 01:15:53.362
That's our guy.

01:16:02.204 --> 01:16:03.272
Gunderson Donuts...

01:16:03.305 --> 01:16:05.107
- <i>Ruth?</i>
- Yeah who's this?

01:16:09.044 --> 01:16:10.813
- Who's that?
- No idea.

01:16:14.016 --> 01:16:14.984
How'd I get him?

01:16:16.118 --> 01:16:16.986
I can't say.

01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:19.388
I'm really a rather
forgetful fellow.

01:16:20.489 --> 01:16:21.924
It's a quality I hope
you can appreciate.

01:16:28.230 --> 01:16:30.966
The fifteenth president of
these United States.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.701
The bubble wrap is not period.

01:16:32.735 --> 01:16:34.069
Forgive the condition.

01:16:34.103 --> 01:16:36.138
Southern secession took
its toll on him.

01:16:37.273 --> 01:16:39.074
Trina said you'd bring cash.

01:16:39.108 --> 01:16:42.945
As you can see, the goods are
exactly as promised, so...

01:16:43.979 --> 01:16:45.247
Shit.

01:16:45.281 --> 01:16:46.682
Do me a favor, folks.

01:16:46.715 --> 01:16:50.986
Look into my dash-cam and say hello
to my friends in Washington, DC.

01:16:51.020 --> 01:16:54.890
Well, don't get discouraged.
I'm willing to work with you three.

01:16:54.924 --> 01:16:56.859
It's not you that I'm after.

01:16:56.892 --> 01:16:59.962
Sorry, sir, but we won't say a
word without an attorney present.

01:16:59.995 --> 01:17:01.096
Ruth Kiesling.

01:17:10.105 --> 01:17:11.373
You want to go ahead?

01:17:11.407 --> 01:17:13.209
No, you were here first.
You go ahead.

01:17:13.242 --> 01:17:15.144
You look to be in a hurry.

01:17:16.011 --> 01:17:17.012
Thank you, sir...

01:17:18.314 --> 01:17:20.049
Are you Ruth Kiesling?

01:17:20.082 --> 01:17:21.317
Well, yes. Yes, I am.

01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:23.385
Where can we talk privately?

01:17:24.053 --> 01:17:26.422
- You ratted me out?
- And guess what?

01:17:27.089 --> 01:17:29.024
You're not gonna get
a dime from this.

01:17:29.058 --> 01:17:31.227
He's not gonna get
a dime from this.

01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:32.895
And the best part?

01:17:32.928 --> 01:17:35.998
Both of you could be going
away for a very long time.

01:17:36.031 --> 01:17:38.033
- I want to see a lawyer.
- Lawyer, huh?

01:17:38.834 --> 01:17:41.103
What are you, some kind
of a tough guy?

01:17:41.136 --> 01:17:42.104
No, I'm not.

01:17:42.137 --> 01:17:43.973
Or maybe you just want a donut.

01:17:44.506 --> 01:17:46.175
- Is that it?
- What?

01:17:46.208 --> 01:17:47.276
Here's your donut!

01:17:49.211 --> 01:17:51.247
How do you like that,
tough guy?

01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:52.982
That was pretty good.

01:17:53.482 --> 01:17:55.985
Now, we can bring the lawyers
in here and play it like that.

01:17:56.518 --> 01:17:59.288
Or there might be a way for the
two of you to walk away from this.

01:17:59.321 --> 01:18:01.423
You already said I could
walk if I gave up Ruth!

01:18:01.457 --> 01:18:02.791
Shut up, Errol.

01:18:02.825 --> 01:18:05.461
I'm just saying, as a trust-builder,
he sets a lousy precedent.

01:18:05.494 --> 01:18:08.030
- Do you want to hear the deal?
- Yeah, I wanna hear the deal...

01:18:08.063 --> 01:18:10.299
- Or do you want another donut?
- No, I'm fine.

01:18:10.332 --> 01:18:13.102
He doesn't want another donut, sir.
We want to hear the deal.

01:18:13.135 --> 01:18:14.370
Oh, now you want
to hear the deal?

01:18:14.403 --> 01:18:16.572
I think we all want
to hear the deal.

01:18:16.606 --> 01:18:17.973
Someone here to see you, Ruth.

01:18:18.007 --> 01:18:22.144
I'm Detective Hostetler,
County Sheriff's Office assisting the FBI.

01:18:22.177 --> 01:18:23.412
You local PD?

01:18:23.445 --> 01:18:26.015
Yeah I've got everything
under control, sir.

01:18:26.048 --> 01:18:27.449
May I see your badge, please?

01:18:33.522 --> 01:18:35.357
So you're from the County
Sheriff's Office?

01:18:35.391 --> 01:18:37.293
Isn't this kinda out
of your jurisdiction?

01:18:37.326 --> 01:18:38.794
You're a probation officer?

01:18:39.928 --> 01:18:42.231
Wait! Probation officer?

01:18:43.065 --> 01:18:46.468
What's a probation officer doing
handcuffing people in a pastry shop?

01:18:47.236 --> 01:18:50.139
It's complicated.

01:18:50.172 --> 01:18:52.508
Excuse me, miss. I'll be eating
two of these donuts here.

01:18:52.541 --> 01:18:56.145
- What do I owe you?
- No charge, those are irregulars.

01:18:56.979 --> 01:18:59.048
You're not taking them
to jail, are you?

01:18:59.081 --> 01:19:00.416
Seems likely.

01:19:00.449 --> 01:19:03.385
But Ruth has to stay and run the
counter during the lunch rush.

01:19:03.419 --> 01:19:06.455
Our boss will get very upset if
she leaves during her shift.

01:19:06.488 --> 01:19:09.291
If your boss gets upset,
have him call my boss.

01:19:13.329 --> 01:19:17.199
Okay, who knows the name of the guy who
was the president just before Lincoln?

01:19:17.966 --> 01:19:21.070
Yeah, she's here... yeah,
we're heading out.

01:19:21.671 --> 01:19:24.173
Yeah, there's two more of
them... yeah, three...

01:19:25.341 --> 01:19:26.241
No?

01:19:26.275 --> 01:19:27.644
Nobody knows his name?

01:19:27.677 --> 01:19:31.146
Well, my boss knows his name and
she'd like to talk to you about him.

01:19:39.088 --> 01:19:40.489
Let me tell you a story...

01:19:41.290 --> 01:19:45.160
Let's start with
extortion, and definitely theft.

01:19:45.194 --> 01:19:47.029
Probably breaking and entering.

01:19:47.062 --> 01:19:50.399
Perhaps vandalism or desecration
of a national monument.

01:19:50.432 --> 01:19:52.968
Definitely possession
of stolen goods.

01:19:53.001 --> 01:19:57.239
And with the various emails and phone
calls, I don't like your chances.

01:19:58.107 --> 01:20:02.044
Your best chance, now your
only chance is going to...

01:20:02.077 --> 01:20:04.146
"Happy birthday to..."

01:20:04.179 --> 01:20:07.082
- Wrong room, people!
- It's room three, guys!

01:20:13.522 --> 01:20:18.360
Let's get some preliminary facts on
the table: Where is the body now?

01:20:20.429 --> 01:20:23.232
I don't get the story.
I'm not a magician.

01:20:24.199 --> 01:20:25.267
Then what are you?

01:20:26.068 --> 01:20:27.704
A donut store employee? Female?

01:20:27.737 --> 01:20:33.075
No, who are you? How do people see you?
What do they expect of you?

01:20:33.643 --> 01:20:35.645
Idiot... disappointment...

01:20:36.979 --> 01:20:40.382
Untrustworthy.... a liar...

01:20:43.285 --> 01:20:46.288
Ruth, where's the body?

01:20:47.322 --> 01:20:48.357
Pennsylvania.

01:20:49.091 --> 01:20:50.192
Excuse me?

01:20:50.225 --> 01:20:52.394
Oh, I never had the
body, Ms. Jarvis.

01:20:52.428 --> 01:20:55.130
I heard he'd been shipped here,
and I just made up all the rest.

01:20:55.164 --> 01:20:57.099
And what about the emails,
the phone calls?

01:20:57.132 --> 01:20:59.568
I was just hoping to find somebody
stupid enough to believe me,

01:20:59.602 --> 01:21:04.139
but everybody checked into it and found
out that he was reburied, so no sale.

01:21:04.173 --> 01:21:05.340
And you don't have the body?

01:21:05.374 --> 01:21:09.044
No, ma'am. I'm just
a liar. Ask anyone.

01:21:13.549 --> 01:21:16.485
So, wait, that's
it? "I'm a liar"?

01:21:16.518 --> 01:21:18.020
That's the lesson
from the story?

01:21:18.053 --> 01:21:19.021
Sure.

01:21:19.054 --> 01:21:21.123
I thought it would be
way bigger than that.

01:21:21.156 --> 01:21:25.728
It's bigger than you think, Miss Kiesling.
It's your reputation.

01:21:25.762 --> 01:21:27.730
Well, it's not a very
positive lesson.

01:21:27.764 --> 01:21:30.499
Well, it wasn't a very
positive story.

01:21:30.532 --> 01:21:34.436
The magician cut that poor woman
in half. Were you not listening?

01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:37.372
Story or no story, I was
definitely gonna lie anyway!

01:21:37.406 --> 01:21:42.612
But at least you were honest in
assessing your own reputation.

01:21:42.645 --> 01:21:44.179
It's important to know.

01:21:44.213 --> 01:21:46.583
But I lied when I
said I was lying!

01:21:46.616 --> 01:21:49.218
Well... you're a liar.

01:21:50.285 --> 01:21:53.188
Errol.
Tell me about the body.

01:21:54.423 --> 01:21:56.291
I don't know anything
about a body.

01:21:56.325 --> 01:21:59.662
Hostetler says he overheard Mr.
Crosby offering you a deal

01:21:59.696 --> 01:22:02.130
and threatening to force-feed
you donuts.

01:22:02.164 --> 01:22:03.298
I don't recall any donuts.

01:22:03.332 --> 01:22:05.234
I can request a stool
sample kit...

01:22:05.267 --> 01:22:06.468
He did feed me one donut.

01:22:06.502 --> 01:22:09.338
And you don't know anything
about President Buchanan's body?

01:22:09.371 --> 01:22:11.039
No, nothing.

01:22:11.073 --> 01:22:13.275
For the record, I'm completely
unaware

01:22:13.308 --> 01:22:18.413
of Ms. Kiesling's guilt or innocence
here but I will agree she is a liar.

01:22:20.215 --> 01:22:21.651
Mr. Crosby...

01:22:22.384 --> 01:22:24.821
Your employee evaluation
is first-rate.

01:22:24.854 --> 01:22:28.791
And yet, we find you
impersonating an officer;

01:22:29.491 --> 01:22:32.528
forcibly feeding donuts to a
puppeteer;

01:22:32.561 --> 01:22:36.265
and handcuffing a
body-snatcher to a bakery shelf

01:22:36.298 --> 01:22:41.169
a full two weeks after she completed
probation under your guidance.

01:22:42.304 --> 01:22:44.841
I was trying to help Ms.
Kiesling get her life back on track, ma'am.

01:22:44.874 --> 01:22:47.109
And you're prepared to throw
away your career

01:22:47.142 --> 01:22:49.779
for a compulsive liar and an
asshole puppeteer?

01:22:49.812 --> 01:22:51.446
Please: "Ventriloquist."

01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:56.451
So tell me: How much of this grave-robbing episode is true?

01:22:56.485 --> 01:22:57.720
Captain, can I see
you for a minute?

01:23:00.422 --> 01:23:03.292
I'd advise you all not to
speak while I'm gone.

01:23:03.325 --> 01:23:05.060
No talking.

01:23:10.532 --> 01:23:11.567
Two weeks?

01:23:11.601 --> 01:23:12.769
No talking.

01:23:12.802 --> 01:23:15.537
I finished two weeks ago?

01:23:15.571 --> 01:23:17.506
I thought I had until
the end of October!

01:23:17.539 --> 01:23:19.508
Why the hell didn't
you say anything?

01:23:20.777 --> 01:23:22.544
I'm so happy for you both.

01:23:22.579 --> 01:23:23.780
No talking.

01:23:28.517 --> 01:23:29.886
Sit down, Ruth...

01:23:29.919 --> 01:23:33.121
I'm afraid it's all
for naught, Miss Kiesling.

01:23:33.155 --> 01:23:37.259
Mr. Crosby is still duty-bound
to tell what he knows.

01:23:37.292 --> 01:23:40.630
And I'm afraid they'll have no
choice but to prosecute.

01:23:40.663 --> 01:23:45.334
Maybe I could say something at
least get the others off the hook.

01:23:45.367 --> 01:23:46.535
It's a thought.

01:23:47.637 --> 01:23:49.338
- Hey, maybe I could say...
- No talking.

01:23:52.709 --> 01:23:56.511
I'm very confident that with the
proper level of resource deployment

01:23:56.545 --> 01:24:00.583
we can very quickly gather the evidence
necessary for criminal prosecution.

01:24:00.617 --> 01:24:06.221
But part of my job is to deploy
resources wherever priorities dictate.

01:24:06.254 --> 01:24:10.392
And I can't help but feel I'm
wasting my time with this thing.

01:24:11.259 --> 01:24:15.230
If this was another president,
you might be looking at federal prison.

01:24:15.263 --> 01:24:18.467
Lucky for you, you chose
the shittiest one.

01:24:20.502 --> 01:24:21.436
Well...

01:24:22.905 --> 01:24:24.907
But if any of this resurfaces

01:24:24.941 --> 01:24:29.746
and risks making the County look negligent
in any way, we'll crash down on you.

01:24:30.445 --> 01:24:31.581
Is that understood?

01:24:31.614 --> 01:24:33.348
Yes, ma'am...

01:24:33.382 --> 01:24:35.652
- Thank you, Ms. Jarvis.
- Are there any questions?

01:24:35.685 --> 01:24:38.387
Did you lose that ear?
There's no bump there.

01:24:39.589 --> 01:24:41.658
That's none of your
goddamn business.

01:24:44.694 --> 01:24:46.663
They never really wanted to
prosecute, you know.

01:24:46.696 --> 01:24:49.732
They just wanted this whole
thing to just go away.

01:24:49.766 --> 01:24:52.935
You've seen those police
procedural shows on TV?

01:24:52.969 --> 01:24:55.738
First thing they do is put
everyone in separate rooms.

01:24:56.471 --> 01:24:57.874
They wanted us to lie.

01:24:57.907 --> 01:24:59.809
So, what do we do
with Buchanan now?

01:24:59.842 --> 01:25:01.778
Can't send him back
to Pennsylvania.

01:25:01.811 --> 01:25:03.846
Maybe we can bury him
here somewhere.

01:25:05.648 --> 01:25:08.685
He took most of Arizona when he was Secretary
of State with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.

01:25:08.718 --> 01:25:09.852
Bury him where?

01:25:09.886 --> 01:25:11.486
Your dad's back yard?

01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:12.855
Yeah nothing creepy about that.

01:25:12.889 --> 01:25:15.692
Well, my family has some land
up north near Prescott.

01:25:15.725 --> 01:25:19.494
It's kinda got pines around there,
so I guess it's kinda like Pennsylvania.

01:25:19.528 --> 01:25:21.229
Not even a couple of
hours from here.

01:25:21.263 --> 01:25:22.699
That'd be nice. Thanks.

01:25:22.732 --> 01:25:23.532
Yeah.

01:25:23.565 --> 01:25:26.301
Look, I've gotta
get back to work.

01:25:26.334 --> 01:25:27.737
I'll take you back to your truck

01:25:27.770 --> 01:25:30.305
but you're gonna have to do this
body-snatcher jamboree without me.

01:25:31.506 --> 01:25:33.609
Thanks, Gretchen.

01:25:35.912 --> 01:25:38.346
You sure you don't want me to
get changed for the funeral?

01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:41.818
I mean, you look great,
all of you do...

01:25:41.851 --> 01:25:43.586
No, you look fine.

01:25:43.619 --> 01:25:45.655
This is just my "Drang
und Sturm" dress.

01:25:45.688 --> 01:25:47.590
It's probably not appropriate
for a funeral.

01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:50.525
Oh, hey, you never told me about
Trina.

01:25:50.559 --> 01:25:53.495
She didn't kick and scream about telling
Errol she found a buyer, did she?

01:25:53.528 --> 01:25:54.731
For setting him up?

01:25:54.764 --> 01:25:56.398
Not at all.

01:25:56.431 --> 01:25:59.802
You know, he pushed her into taking the
rap for one of his burglaries last summer.

01:25:59.836 --> 01:26:02.504
We found you a big sweater.
Should fit you fine.

01:26:03.472 --> 01:26:04.907
Got some other stuff here, too.

01:26:04.941 --> 01:26:07.677
Shouldn't be that cold,
but... I'll be fine.

01:26:07.710 --> 01:26:09.679
Oh I almost forgot
the grave-scotch!

01:26:16.085 --> 01:26:18.487
I tried to get you back
to Pennsylvania.

01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:19.622
Really.

01:26:20.388 --> 01:26:21.256
I know.

01:26:22.557 --> 01:26:24.426
That magician story.
Was it true?

01:26:26.028 --> 01:26:27.362
Well,

01:26:28.097 --> 01:26:32.400
I was in Paris in 1855.

01:26:32.434 --> 01:26:35.004
I did attend the theater.

01:26:35.705 --> 01:26:39.041
I have seen a magician
perform this illusion.

01:26:39.709 --> 01:26:44.847
And quite famously a stage performer
did do away with his mistress.

01:26:45.782 --> 01:26:47.884
There are four truths
right there.

01:26:50.887 --> 01:26:53.923
Ah, you finished that
book, didn't you?

01:26:57.026 --> 01:27:00.897
And I assume it concluded

01:27:01.731 --> 01:27:05.500
I was one of our country's worst
presidents.

01:27:05.534 --> 01:27:06.669
The worst.

01:27:07.103 --> 01:27:09.005
They've done these polls for
decades.

01:27:09.038 --> 01:27:13.876
Historians, scholars,
politicians; they all seem to agree.

01:27:14.844 --> 01:27:19.649
It doesn't mean you're a bad person,
just that you were a shitty president.

01:27:19.682 --> 01:27:24.954
Well, I admit those claims
aren't entirely groundless.

01:27:26.022 --> 01:27:29.025
But when my term ended,

01:27:29.725 --> 01:27:34.496
and the fruits of my "leadership"
blossomed full-flower

01:27:35.064 --> 01:27:37.667
into the splintering
of the Union,

01:27:38.835 --> 01:27:43.505
I sadly did not
submit my questionable actions

01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:46.876
to the level of analytic
scrutiny I would have applied

01:27:46.909 --> 01:27:52.547
to even a minor case as a law
clerk back in Lancaster.

01:27:53.883 --> 01:27:57.887
No, instead I spent the
remaining years of my life

01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:00.590
defending those decisions.

01:28:00.623 --> 01:28:02.024
My point is:

01:28:02.058 --> 01:28:06.796
Nothing productive
came of this posture

01:28:06.829 --> 01:28:11.634
and it was
those parts of my reputation

01:28:11.667 --> 01:28:13.769
that calcified into legacy.

01:28:13.803 --> 01:28:19.141
I mean, I'm not that scowling
troglodyte you see in my photographs!

01:28:19.175 --> 01:28:23.112
I, like you, was once considered
a hail-fellow-well-met!

01:28:23.779 --> 01:28:26.115
I charmed the Czar of Russia!

01:28:26.148 --> 01:28:28.951
Can you imagine how
difficult that was?

01:28:28.985 --> 01:28:30.586
The czar was kind of a douche?

01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:32.755
Staggeringly so!

01:28:34.624 --> 01:28:39.461
And it is unconscionable to define a
man strictly on his lowest moments.

01:28:40.162 --> 01:28:42.965
But mine occurred so close to
the end of my life

01:28:42.999 --> 01:28:46.636
and that they
affected every single American

01:28:47.603 --> 01:28:53.508
made it infinitely more difficult
to right the ship on my own behalf.

01:28:56.746 --> 01:29:00.983
But not everyone is subject
to such forces.

01:29:02.484 --> 01:29:03.485
I guess not.

01:29:05.788 --> 01:29:08.523
Look, they reevaluate
presidents all the time.

01:29:10.192 --> 01:29:13.461
When somebody does come along
that rates worse than you,

01:29:13.495 --> 01:29:16.065
which will probably happen
sooner rather than later,

01:29:16.098 --> 01:29:19.769
it doesn't mean you'll be any better,
just that somebody else will be worse.

01:29:19.802 --> 01:29:22.805
And that's not exactly the goal
that we're reaching for.

01:29:24.707 --> 01:29:27.977
And if the country needed a big shitshow
like the Civil War to end slavery

01:29:28.010 --> 01:29:29.412
instead of kicking
it down the road

01:29:29.444 --> 01:29:33.783
then maybe you were the best worst
president at the exact right time.

01:29:35.151 --> 01:29:38.921
Not exactly "forgiveness,"
but it's something.

01:29:40.990 --> 01:29:45.493
Well, I can't say I rate
forgiveness,

01:29:46.561 --> 01:29:48.931
but I appreciate
the sentiment.

01:29:53.636 --> 01:29:54.670
Miss Kiesling.

01:29:56.205 --> 01:29:57.572
Mr. President.

01:30:22.698 --> 01:30:24.133
What the hell do you want?

01:30:24.166 --> 01:30:26.268
We were in the middle of a
business transaction.

01:30:26.302 --> 01:30:28.170
I neglected to collect my money.

01:30:29.772 --> 01:30:31.941
- Thirty-five hundred dollars.
- You know what...

01:30:32.942 --> 01:30:35.011
You stole him from us!

01:30:35.044 --> 01:30:40.116
And I have had a really
rough week.

01:30:42.151 --> 01:30:44.820
Mr. Crosby knows the value
of what I'm offering...

01:30:50.359 --> 01:30:52.028
Aren't you gonna do something?

01:30:52.995 --> 01:30:55.865
No. I think we're gonna leave.

01:30:58.701 --> 01:30:59.902
The chairs are on the tables.

01:31:06.175 --> 01:31:07.076
Butthole.

01:31:26.862 --> 01:31:29.965
Should have prepared
something. Shit.

01:31:32.301 --> 01:31:36.105
Here lies President James
Buchanan, no middle name.

01:31:37.106 --> 01:31:41.177
Sometimes known as "Old Public
Functionary," which is very sad.

01:31:43.279 --> 01:31:45.281
He didn't choose the times he
was born into

01:31:45.314 --> 01:31:48.284
or the crazy circumstances that
he found himself in.

01:31:50.853 --> 01:31:52.388
He made a lot of stupid
decisions

01:31:52.421 --> 01:31:56.592
based on some flawed thinking but you
don't have to be an idiot to do that.

01:31:57.259 --> 01:32:00.396
And though people said some really
unkind things about him as President,

01:32:00.429 --> 01:32:03.999
I don't think he was quite the turd
that history has painted him out to be.

01:32:06.268 --> 01:32:07.169
Amen.

01:32:08.003 --> 01:32:09.038
Amen.

01:32:28.057 --> 01:32:31.760
You guys, my dad made me promise not to have
any sort of ceremony or anything for him.

01:32:32.328 --> 01:32:34.997
But after I get his ashes back
next week,

01:32:35.030 --> 01:32:37.233
I'd really like it if you came
with me to distribute them.

01:32:37.266 --> 01:32:39.235
Just on a couple of graves and
on that rock

01:32:39.268 --> 01:32:41.837
I gotta throw through the
appliance store window.

01:32:43.405 --> 01:32:44.773
I think he'd be okay with that.

01:32:46.475 --> 01:32:49.178
You got more guts than Dick Tracy
letting Meg drive that thing.

01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:52.081
She'll be fine.

01:32:53.349 --> 01:32:54.416
This is getting ridiculous.

01:32:54.450 --> 01:32:56.986
I'm gonna be the laughing
stock of the wilderness.

01:33:01.056 --> 01:33:02.892
What's up with those
arms, Mr. Tat?

01:33:02.925 --> 01:33:04.126
A little inky rebellion?

01:33:05.161 --> 01:33:06.929
I got that a long time ago.

01:33:06.962 --> 01:33:08.397
Seemed like a good
idea at the time.

01:33:09.098 --> 01:33:10.766
You know, you really
have talent, Ruth.

01:33:11.300 --> 01:33:13.469
That music was incredible.

01:33:13.502 --> 01:33:14.803
Oh, I didn't write that.

01:33:14.837 --> 01:33:16.739
That's Durant's Sonata
in D-major.

01:33:16.772 --> 01:33:17.973
Well, you played it great.

01:33:18.007 --> 01:33:19.808
Nah, my fingers were numb.

01:33:19.842 --> 01:33:21.977
- I played like shit.
- I disagree.

01:33:22.011 --> 01:33:23.412
And that eulogy.

01:33:24.847 --> 01:33:28.017
Don't think I ever heard a eulogy
where the word "turd" was mentioned.

01:33:28.050 --> 01:33:29.685
Well, I was just winging it.

01:33:30.452 --> 01:33:33.255
Are you really gonna throw that
rock through the window?

01:33:33.289 --> 01:33:35.291
I don't even know if that
same guy owns the place.

01:33:36.225 --> 01:33:37.960
But if he does... then, yeah.

01:33:39.395 --> 01:33:41.263
What was that?

01:33:42.431 --> 01:33:44.066
Oh, Meg!

01:33:45.968 --> 01:33:47.536
Sorry.

01:33:47.570 --> 01:33:50.206
- I kept the bucket down, but I didn't watch the sides.
- Are you okay?

01:33:50.239 --> 01:33:51.740
Banged my knee, but I'm okay.

01:33:51.774 --> 01:33:53.075
Knocked over your tree
thingy, though.

01:33:53.108 --> 01:33:56.011
Well that's no big deal.
At least one of them falls every year.

01:33:56.478 --> 01:33:58.280
- You sure you're okay?
- I'm fine.

01:33:58.314 --> 01:34:00.082
Just a little embarrassed...

01:34:00.115 --> 01:34:01.817
Ruth, can you give me
a hand here, will you?

01:34:07.156 --> 01:34:10.159
I was really cooking 'til the
tree just jumped in my path...

01:34:21.203 --> 01:34:22.304
That should do it.

01:34:26.141 --> 01:34:27.009
Hmm...

01:34:29.912 --> 01:34:30.779
What?

01:34:32.214 --> 01:34:33.282
I thought you'd be taller.
