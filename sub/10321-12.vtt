[ Earl Narrating ] One thing
about cold nights at the motel,
Randy and I slept like babies.

But that wasn't just
because of the temperature.

That's where he was.

at a gas station.

00:51.419 --> 00:54.588
A few years ago,
I was hanging out
in a gas station bathroom...

00:54.622 --> 00:57.658

drop his pants and provide me
with an opportunity.

Ah, they have my favorite brand
of toilet paper in here.

You know the kind of guy
who does nothing
but bad things...

01:31.259 --> 01:32.860
and then wonders why
his life sucks?

01:35.196 --> 01:37.631
Well, that was me.
Every time somethin' good
happened to me,

01:37.665 --> 01:39.800
somethin' bad
was always waitin'
around the corner.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.706
That's when I realized
I had to change.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.843
So I made a list
of everything bad
I've ever done,

01:49.877 --> 01:52.880

I'm gonna make up
for all my mistakes.

I had stolen a lot
of wallets in my day,

but that one
was the mother lode.
Whoo-hoo!

02:12.633 --> 02:17.471
So, that afternoon,
we took the money to Jasper's
for a little shopping spree.

02:17.505 --> 02:20.374
Jasper's
is kind of like the mall,
only it's in a storage unit,

02:20.408 --> 02:23.477
and everything there
is stolen from the mall.

02:23.511 --> 02:26.714
And with
a thousand dollars to spend,
we were living like kings.

02:26.747 --> 02:28.882
Hey, we're out of lime mix,

gonna have to be cola flavored

Why can't you just give him
back his wallet with a thousand

It reminds me
of kindergarten.

down the slushy machine,

02:53.874 --> 02:55.976
I found someone
had moved in.

with a turtle and whatnot.

that exercise wheel?

Not as much
as I hoped he would.
Does he do any tricks?

he's so full of crap!

12:12.265 --> 12:14.434
Yes!

12:14.467 --> 12:17.504
Listen, Xena.
Try not to get so worked up
by Mr. Patrick.

12:17.537 --> 12:19.873
He'll get his payback.

12:19.907 --> 12:22.776
There's a thing
in this universe,
an uncontrolled force.

12:22.810 --> 12:24.878
It's called--
I love you too, Earl.

12:24.912 --> 12:27.547
You'll be my first.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.150
No, no, no, no. No.
I was talking about karma.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.986
Oh. Karma.

12:33.020 --> 12:35.388
It, uh, takes care
of mean people.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.557
Mr. Patrick will get
everything he deserves.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.927
[ Sighs ]

12:39.960 --> 12:42.830
[ Earl Narrating ]
But as I drove up
to Mr. Patrick's house,

12:42.863 --> 12:47.134
I realized he had way more
than he deserved.

12:47.167 --> 12:50.537
He had a beautiful house
in a beautiful neighborhood,
but that wasn't all.

12:50.570 --> 12:54.141
Hi! Come on in.

12:54.174 --> 12:56.276
Pat told me
you were coming.

12:56.309 --> 12:59.046
[ Earl Narrating ]
He also had a beautiful wife
he didn't deserve.

13:03.884 --> 13:06.887
Is-Is there any chance
that Mr. Patrick
is your brother?

13:06.920 --> 13:10.423
I hope not,
not with all the stuff
I let him do to me.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.359
Anyway, wait right here.

13:12.392 --> 13:16.864
I'm gonna go get
the dry cleaning
Pat said you'd take in.

13:16.897 --> 13:19.867
[ Earl Narrating ]
I couldn't believe Mr. Patrick
scored a woman like that...

13:19.900 --> 13:22.035
and a house like this.

13:22.069 --> 13:25.538
And, as I took a look
around the rest of the place,
it only got worse.

13:25.572 --> 13:30.343
There he was, sitting
in the back of a brand-new,
customized F-250,

13:30.377 --> 13:33.380
complete with stenciling.

13:33.413 --> 13:37.017
And how he got
so many friends,
I have no idea.

13:40.087 --> 13:43.023
And I couldn't
imagine him doing anything
good enough in life...

13:43.056 --> 13:45.558
to deserve a special mug
saying it.

13:47.127 --> 13:49.596
No way.

13:49.629 --> 13:52.499
Oh, sorry.
I was just, uh--
[ Clears Throat ]

13:52.532 --> 13:55.135
looking at Mr. Patrick's
best stuff mugs.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.437
Oh. Well,
that one's not his.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.572
Really?
It's mine.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.243
Of course it is.

14:03.276 --> 14:06.479
Of course it is.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.348
Here you go.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.324
I don't get it, Randy.
It doesn't make sense.

14:17.357 --> 14:20.160
Karma should be
kicking the crap out
of a guy like that.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.262
Maybe he's nice
outside of work.

14:22.295 --> 14:24.898
He could deserve good karma
that way, right?
I don't know.

14:24.932 --> 14:28.936
Even if he pulled his face off,
and underneath was that guy from
U2 that does all that charity,

14:28.969 --> 14:31.004
he still wouldn't deserve
a wife that hot.

14:31.038 --> 14:33.573
Maybe he's being punished
in some secret way.

14:33.606 --> 14:36.376
I had a horrible uncle
with a hot wife
and a big house,

14:36.409 --> 14:39.947
but later we found out
that the house and the wife
both had mold in the basement.

14:41.514 --> 14:43.416
Mold in the basement.

14:45.618 --> 14:49.122
Well, maybe there's more to
Mr. Patrick that I don't know.

14:49.156 --> 14:51.558
Bono.
That's the guy from U2--
Sonny Bono.

14:51.591 --> 14:54.194
I should be on that show
where you have to remember
the names of things.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.629
What's it called?

14:59.099 --> 15:02.269
[ Earl Narrating ]
I decided to keep a much
closer eye on Mr. Patrick,

15:02.302 --> 15:05.338
hoping I'd find
hidden information that would
make sense of his life.

15:05.372 --> 15:07.674
Maybe I'd discover
he was a better man
than I thought.

15:10.143 --> 15:12.012
But he wasn't.

15:36.169 --> 15:39.339
[ Earl Narrating ] As far
as I could tell, Mr. Patrick
never did anything good.

15:39.372 --> 15:43.343
And when he had the chance to
do the right thing, he didn't.

15:43.376 --> 15:47.447
This guy definitely
didn't deserve all
the nice things he had.

15:47.480 --> 15:51.218
He even had a nice
little thing he was cheating
on his wife with.

15:51.251 --> 15:55.422
Nope. Mr. Patrick didn't
seem to be suffering one bit.
It just didn't make sense.

15:55.455 --> 15:59.092
He wasn't gettin' punished
at all for any of the bad things
he was doing.

15:59.126 --> 16:01.128
There was only one place
left to look,

16:01.161 --> 16:03.130
one place karma
could be punishing him.

16:06.233 --> 16:08.401
[ Earl Narrating ]
I didn't want to check there,
but I had to.

16:10.203 --> 16:12.572
Come on, man!

16:15.408 --> 16:19.012
Ah, I'm just having
a little trouble
working up a stream.

16:19.046 --> 16:21.381
Try blowin' on it.

16:21.414 --> 16:24.117
Excuse me?

16:24.151 --> 16:25.585
[ Blows ]

16:27.720 --> 16:30.090
There you go.

16:31.591 --> 16:34.361
[ Clears Throat ]
Thank you, sir.

16:34.394 --> 16:37.430
[ Earl Narrating ]
I could see that karma
wasn't punishing Mr. Patrick.

16:37.464 --> 16:40.200
What I didn't get
was why it was punishing me.

16:40.233 --> 16:43.170
What do you want-- a snake,
an eel or an earthworm?
I want a dinosaur.

16:43.203 --> 16:47.207
A dinosaur? Here.
This is not a dinosaur.

16:47.240 --> 16:51.511
Sure, it is.
It's a Balloon-osaurus rex.
Now, get out of here.

16:51.544 --> 16:54.381
Hickey!
You take these balloons
back from these kids,

16:54.414 --> 16:56.683
and you start making poodles
and funny hats right now.

16:56.716 --> 16:59.152
I told you, I don't know how
to make balloon animals.

16:59.186 --> 17:02.689
You don't know how
to make a balloon animal?

17:02.722 --> 17:06.093
Are you telling me that
you're too stupid to understand
how to bend a balloon?

17:06.126 --> 17:08.261
[ Earl Narrating ]
It's amazing how humiliated
you can feel...

17:08.295 --> 17:10.363
dressed as a hamburger,
being poked by a balloon.

17:10.397 --> 17:13.500
Now, you apologize
to these children right now!
See this, kids?

17:13.533 --> 17:15.668
This is why you
stay in school.

17:15.702 --> 17:19.339
So you don't end up
in a hamburger outfit,
too stupid to bend balloons.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.741
Hickey,
I told you to apologize.
What's your problem?

17:21.774 --> 17:24.077
I want you to apologize
to these kids right now.

17:24.111 --> 17:27.747
Are you too stupid
to say you're stupid?

17:27.780 --> 17:30.617
[ Earl Narrating ] No one has
ever treated me that bad before
and gotten away with it,

17:30.650 --> 17:32.419
especially a boss.

17:32.452 --> 17:35.288
But I stuck with karma
this long, so I knew I
had to keep my cool.

17:41.694 --> 17:45.698
Unfortunately, knowing
something and doing something
are two different things.

17:45.732 --> 17:48.401
[ Grunting ]

17:48.435 --> 17:51.504
Whoa! Take it easy, Xena!
You don't wanna swallow
that new retainer.

17:51.538 --> 17:54.574
Oh, God!
Your hands on my body
feel so right.

17:54.607 --> 17:56.409
What?
Nothing.

17:57.510 --> 18:00.680
[ Grunts ]

18:00.713 --> 18:03.550
[ Earl Narrating ] I felt bad
about sending Mr. Patrick
to the emergency room,

18:03.583 --> 18:06.353
but when I found out
what I started,
I felt even worse.

18:08.255 --> 18:10.357
Thanks to me,
the women he tried so hard
to keep separate--

18:13.660 --> 18:17.164
well, they were finally
brought together.

18:17.197 --> 18:19.332
Seems I hurt more than
just Mr. Patrick's eye.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.171
World's--
Hey, come on!

18:24.204 --> 18:25.905
- best--
- Not the mugs!

- son of a bitch!
- Charmaine!

18:31.178 --> 18:34.414
[ Earl Narrating ] And while
his wife was kicking him out
for seeing another woman,

18:34.447 --> 18:38.218
she found out how he was able
to afford another woman.

18:38.251 --> 18:41.454
Turned out law enforcement was
as unhappy about his behavior
as she was.

18:43.823 --> 18:47.460
I felt awful.
I just wanted to hit the guy,
not ruin his life.

18:50.430 --> 18:53.366
I wish
I could say something
to make you feel better.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.635
I don't know
what you can say, Randy.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.737
I started out trying
to do something good...

18:57.770 --> 19:00.307
and ended up
getting the guy divorced
and thrown in jail.

19:00.340 --> 19:02.575
I screwed up.
That's all there is to it.

19:04.411 --> 19:06.513
You said karma would
get him eventually.

19:06.546 --> 19:09.616
I said karma, not my fist.
But karma
doesn't have fists.

19:13.453 --> 19:16.223
You know what? You're right.
Karma doesn't have fists.

19:16.256 --> 19:20.960
Karma doesn't have
hands at all, or feet.
Does karma have feet?

19:20.993 --> 19:23.696
Maybe karma's behind
this whole thing, Randy.

19:23.730 --> 19:26.266
I mean, the guy finally
got what he deserved.

19:26.299 --> 19:29.436
Maybe karma just borrowed
my fist to give it to him.
'Cause karma doesn't have fists.

19:30.737 --> 19:34.441
Wow. Karma used me
to do its dirty work.

19:34.474 --> 19:37.377
Nice move, karma.
Nice move.

19:37.410 --> 19:40.747
[ Earl Narrating ]
As it turned out,
not just to punish a bad guy,

19:40.780 --> 19:43.450
but to reward
some good people too.

19:43.483 --> 19:46.419
Mrs. Patrick took
ownership of the restaurant
and made Jeff the manager.

19:55.828 --> 19:59.499
[ Earl Narrating ]
And with Jeff as manager,
everybody got raises...

19:59.532 --> 20:01.668
and health insurance to cover
new retainers for Xena.
[ Sneezes ]

20:05.372 --> 20:07.807
In the end, everyone got
what they deserved,

20:07.840 --> 20:09.976
and I was able to cross
number 202 off my list.

20:23.290 --> 20:26.959
Oh. It's a burger.

Want me to try
and get him?
No, I like him.

20:41.841 --> 20:44.444
I was thinking maybe we
should name him, you know?

20:44.477 --> 20:46.946
And that way he'd be our pet
and not just a mouse.

20:46.979 --> 20:50.717
- How 'bout William?
- Nah. I don't like William.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.019
We could call him Bill
for short.

20:53.052 --> 20:55.688
I never understood how Bill
was short for William.

20:55.722 --> 20:59.792

Bill should be short
for Billiam, you know?

Good night, Earl.
