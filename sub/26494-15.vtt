00:00.300 --> 00:01.499
You're keeping the snake?

00:01.898 --> 00:03.264
I didn't want
to leave it there.

00:03.668 --> 00:05.234
And I didn't want
to just kill it.

00:14.279 --> 00:17.447
Michael's in there, and he is
fighting hard to get out.

00:17.449 --> 00:20.916
I can't let my guard down,
not for a second.

00:20.918 --> 00:23.385
I was touched by God?

00:23.387 --> 00:25.320
Or possibly
his sister, Amara.

00:25.322 --> 00:27.189
Amara sucked out his soul.

00:27.191 --> 00:28.423
What did you do
to that boy?

00:28.425 --> 00:29.992
When I cast
the transformation spell,

00:29.994 --> 00:31.559
I felt something else
pushing back.

00:31.561 --> 00:32.995
Volatile magic --

00:32.997 --> 00:36.465
powerful and stitched to him
like some kind of parasite.

00:36.467 --> 00:37.932
What is the good
of having these powers

00:37.934 --> 00:39.834
if I can't help the people
that I love?

00:39.836 --> 00:41.669
Michael. He's gone.

00:41.671 --> 00:44.473
Hello, Rowena.
I'm looking for a new home.

00:44.475 --> 00:45.607
Say yes.

00:48.712 --> 00:51.713
I'm the son of Lucifer.
I am a Winchester!

00:51.715 --> 00:54.349
You won't hurt anyone
ever again!

00:55.419 --> 00:58.053
- Jack?
- I'm me again.

01:20.044 --> 01:22.177
Sunny?

01:22.179 --> 01:24.112
Sunny?

01:25.549 --> 01:26.782
Conrad?

01:28.953 --> 01:30.852
What are you --
You have to go!

01:30.854 --> 01:32.854
I don't want to leave
without you.

01:34.058 --> 01:36.391
I can't.
I made a promise.

01:37.628 --> 01:39.962
Conrad, go!
Please.

01:46.303 --> 01:47.536
I love you.

02:15.366 --> 02:17.666
- Phone! I need a phone!
- Whoa. Slow down.

02:17.668 --> 02:20.402
I need a phone!

02:20.404 --> 02:21.970
Hey! That's my phone!

02:21.972 --> 02:23.305
Hey!

02:26.277 --> 02:27.542
I'm gonna call 911!

02:34.485 --> 02:36.218
Aaaaah!

02:42.259 --> 02:45.594
Dude?

02:45.596 --> 02:47.729
Do you need help?

03:16.961 --> 03:19.328
Hey, Jack.

03:19.330 --> 03:21.063
I'm good, Castiel.

03:22.934 --> 03:24.500
Jack, you say that,

03:24.502 --> 03:28.270
but ever since the Hunters
and their funerals...

03:36.747 --> 03:37.880
How's the snake?

03:37.882 --> 03:40.749
I don't think
he's feeling well.

03:42.219 --> 03:43.452
He won't eat.

03:43.454 --> 03:45.721
Well, perhaps he misses
his previous owner.

03:45.723 --> 03:47.756
He's been through

03:47.758 --> 03:50.626
a lot of change
in a short period of time.

03:50.628 --> 03:55.197
I guess that's something
you have in common.

03:55.199 --> 03:58.834
Jack, you killed Michael.

03:58.836 --> 04:00.469
You consumed his grace.

04:00.471 --> 04:03.238
It was enough.

04:03.240 --> 04:05.708
You have
your powers back?

04:08.946 --> 04:10.279
I think so.

04:20.124 --> 04:24.727
I feel different now,
not like before,

04:24.729 --> 04:26.595
if that makes any sense.

04:26.597 --> 04:29.064
And your soul?

04:33.971 --> 04:36.472
You want to know
how much of my soul

04:36.474 --> 04:38.340
I had to burn off
to kill Michael.

04:38.342 --> 04:39.742
Yes.

04:41.545 --> 04:43.012
I don't know.

04:48.986 --> 04:51.420
I try not
to think about it.

05:10.374 --> 05:12.574
Oh. Thought you, uh,

05:12.576 --> 05:14.877
were gonna sleep until
the cows dragged you home.

05:14.879 --> 05:18.647
That's not the --
Never mind.

05:18.649 --> 05:21.250
I was putting some gear away,
and Rowena called.

05:21.252 --> 05:22.751
How is she?

05:22.753 --> 05:25.154
Not great.
She's coping.

05:25.156 --> 05:28.123
But, uh, you know,
at least she's not dead.

05:28.125 --> 05:29.224
How's the kid?

05:29.226 --> 05:31.927
Well, he says
he's good, but...

05:31.929 --> 05:33.095
What about Sam?

05:33.097 --> 05:35.197
He says he's good.

05:36.500 --> 05:38.333
I think they're both
full of crap.

05:58.055 --> 05:59.655
Sam!

06:21.645 --> 06:24.880
Hey. Found us a case.
Arkansas.

06:26.317 --> 06:29.218
We've just done three
back-to-back Hunts.

06:29.220 --> 06:31.320
I need some rest.
At least a night.

06:31.322 --> 06:32.488
We both do.

06:32.490 --> 06:40.329
Yeah, well...
I'm leaving in ten.

06:40.331 --> 06:42.397
Like I said, not good.

06:42.399 --> 06:45.868
Maybe I should go with him.
And you can stay with Jack.

06:45.870 --> 06:47.069
Why?

06:47.071 --> 06:50.038
You were right.
Jack is struggling.

06:50.040 --> 06:51.231
And I've tried, but --

06:51.233 --> 06:52.599
Why do you think
he'll talk to me?

06:52.601 --> 06:54.368
Well, because
he looks up to you.

06:54.370 --> 06:57.871
And his soul -- I mean,
you've seen this before.

06:57.873 --> 07:00.274
No, no. No.
See, I was --

07:00.276 --> 07:03.076
I was not great with Sam,
you know, when he was, uh...

07:03.078 --> 07:05.212
But Jack's soul
isn't completely gone.

07:05.214 --> 07:07.347
At least I don't think so.

07:07.349 --> 07:09.149
W-We just don't know
how much is left.

07:09.151 --> 07:11.552
Well, how am <i>I</i> supposed to
figure that out?

07:11.554 --> 07:12.819
I don't know!

07:12.821 --> 07:15.422
Just talk to him.
Get him to open up.

07:15.424 --> 07:18.759
And then...

07:18.761 --> 07:20.627
Sleep until the cows
come home.

07:20.629 --> 07:23.330
- There it is.
- That's the saying.

07:48.757 --> 07:50.524
So we're looking
for a witch?

07:51.627 --> 07:55.729
Exploding heads.
sounds like a witch.

07:55.731 --> 07:56.830
Or a demon.

07:56.832 --> 07:58.999
Maybe.

08:00.002 --> 08:01.868
Sam...

08:01.870 --> 08:04.071
I'm good.
I'm good, honestly.

08:04.073 --> 08:05.806
Yeah, I know.
Everybody's good.

08:05.808 --> 08:08.342
But after this, maybe...

08:08.344 --> 08:10.010
Dean's right.
You need to rest.

08:10.012 --> 08:12.746
Can't.
Just because I'm tired

08:12.748 --> 08:15.182
doesn't mean the monsters
are gonna stop, you know?

08:15.184 --> 08:17.684
Doesn't mean anything.
Plus...

08:17.686 --> 08:20.053
we don't have as many Hunters
as we used to.

08:21.690 --> 08:24.324
- Excuse me. Griffin?
- Yeah?

08:24.326 --> 08:25.926
- Griffin Tate?
- Mm-hmm.

08:25.928 --> 08:29.196
Agent Scholz.
This is Agent Delp.

08:29.198 --> 08:33.467
We're, uh, FBI.
We're here about the incident.

08:33.469 --> 08:36.035
"Incident"? <i>That's</i> what
we're calling it?

08:36.038 --> 08:38.304
Well...

08:38.307 --> 08:40.006
what would <i>you</i>
call it?

08:40.676 --> 08:42.909
Insane! This guy --

08:42.910 --> 08:45.312
- You mean Conrad Martin.
- Right.

08:45.314 --> 08:48.215
He comes in looking like
he's been running all night,

08:48.217 --> 08:51.585
asks for my phone,
then he just...

08:54.023 --> 08:55.989
...went all "Scanners."

08:55.991 --> 08:59.526
Was it more "Scanners"
1, 2, or 3?

08:59.528 --> 09:02.262
Never mind that.

09:02.264 --> 09:05.232
Um, this Conrad Martin.
Did you know him?

09:05.234 --> 09:09.102
No, but he was probably
from Charming Acres.

09:09.104 --> 09:10.203
He had that "look."

09:10.205 --> 09:11.905
Charming Acres?

09:11.907 --> 09:13.607
About five miles
up the road.

09:16.545 --> 09:18.345
But it's weird.

09:19.948 --> 09:21.548
Weird how?

09:43.872 --> 09:46.940
Good day!
Good day to you!

09:46.942 --> 09:49.609
- Hey, Carl.
- Hi, there. Nice to see you!

09:49.611 --> 09:51.211
- This is...
- Yeah.

09:51.213 --> 09:55.215
It's like we're stepping into
a <i>Saturday Evening Post.</i>

09:59.755 --> 10:04.558
I look at them sometimes after
you fall asleep at night.

10:04.560 --> 10:05.992
They're very soothing.

10:08.664 --> 10:09.963
Should we call Dean?

10:09.965 --> 10:14.034
I mean, I've been trying,
but...no bars.

10:14.036 --> 10:16.470
Guess this place really is
the middle of nowhere.

10:16.472 --> 10:18.505
All right.
Let's get to it.

10:18.507 --> 10:21.308
- Whoa, Nelly! Excuse us.
- Sorry.

10:21.310 --> 10:22.676
You know what?
A-Actually...

10:22.678 --> 10:24.811
I'm sorry.
D-Do you have a moment?

10:24.813 --> 10:27.514
Well, we're on our way
to the bake sale.

10:27.516 --> 10:31.585
We're FBI. We're looking into
a death that happened near here.

10:31.587 --> 10:34.087
Wowee!
A couple of G-Men, huh?

10:34.089 --> 10:37.491
Well, I'm Justin Smith, and
this is my foxy wife, Cindy.

10:37.493 --> 10:39.626
Sweetie, we are
going to be late.

10:39.628 --> 10:41.128
Oh, sorry, Agent.

10:41.130 --> 10:42.963
I haven't heard
about anyone dying,

10:42.965 --> 10:46.066
but, uh,
ask at Harrington's.

10:46.068 --> 10:47.901
And try a milkshake.
They're the best!

10:49.138 --> 10:51.004
Say, what's that
ya got there?

10:51.006 --> 10:53.573
Strawberry jam...

10:53.575 --> 10:55.342
My...cellphone?

10:55.344 --> 10:58.478
Huh.
"Cell...phone."

10:59.248 --> 11:01.214
Honey, my cakes
are getting cold.

11:02.551 --> 11:07.721
Huh. Cell...phone.
A cell phone?

11:07.723 --> 11:09.289
What was that?

11:09.291 --> 11:12.492
Maybe they're Mormon?

11:12.494 --> 11:16.396
♪ ...why we're so far apart ♪

11:19.301 --> 11:22.269

Sweetheart, can you make sure
we get some more root beer?

11:45.727 --> 11:48.495
Already sent
the order, Pops.

11:48.497 --> 11:49.863
Here you go.

11:49.865 --> 11:51.898
Oh, no. Sorry.
We didn't order --

11:51.900 --> 11:54.501
First one's free.
Everyone loves the milkshakes.

11:54.503 --> 11:57.204
Oh. Thanks.

12:01.210 --> 12:03.777
Wow. That is, uh...

12:05.514 --> 12:06.680
Delicious.

12:06.682 --> 12:08.882
- See?
- Sunny, can you make me a --

12:08.884 --> 12:11.418
A banana split with extra cherries for
Miss Lewis, coming up!

12:11.420 --> 12:14.087
You know, I would lose my mind
if it wasn't for that girl.

12:14.089 --> 12:17.624
You must be the flatfoots
I keep hearing about.

12:17.626 --> 12:21.695
"Keep"? We've barely
been here five minutes.

12:21.697 --> 12:23.563
It's a small town.

12:23.565 --> 12:25.465
Chip Harrington.
I'm the mayor.

12:25.467 --> 12:27.033
Mayor? Oh.

12:27.035 --> 12:30.871
Um, it's a...nice town
you got here, Mayor.

12:30.873 --> 12:32.973
Yeah, I know what
you're thinking.

12:32.975 --> 12:34.941
We're a little bit
old-fashioned, huh?

12:34.943 --> 12:37.811
You know,
people who live here --

12:37.813 --> 12:42.616
well, we take care
of each other.

12:44.119 --> 12:46.753
We're here about
Conrad Martin.

12:46.755 --> 12:48.421
I don't know
if you heard...

12:48.423 --> 12:51.024
I have.
Poor kid.

12:51.026 --> 12:52.859
You know,
the police came by.

12:52.861 --> 12:56.830
They said something about
an aneurysm or something?

12:56.832 --> 12:59.366
Oh, no.
His head exploded.

12:59.368 --> 13:00.767
Wh--

13:05.440 --> 13:06.907
I'm sorry?

13:06.909 --> 13:09.009
Like a ripe melon
on the sun.

13:09.011 --> 13:12.512
Okay. Uh, you know what?
We, uh --

13:12.514 --> 13:15.849
We're just looking to find out
everything we can about him.

13:16.818 --> 13:19.419
Yeah, well, uh, I can point you
to where he was staying.

13:19.421 --> 13:22.155
Would that help?
That'll work.

13:32.501 --> 13:34.267
"Like a ripe melon
on the sun"?

13:34.269 --> 13:36.202
It was an apt metaphor.

13:36.204 --> 13:37.804
Okay, well,
maybe next time

13:37.806 --> 13:40.507
try to be a little less...apt.

13:40.509 --> 13:42.275
Oh.

13:48.483 --> 13:51.685
The entire town is so
strangely picturesque.

13:51.687 --> 13:54.621
Yeah, it's kind of nice.
All right. Here's the plan.

13:54.623 --> 13:58.858
We go in, sweep for sulfur,
hex bags. You know, the usual.

13:58.860 --> 14:00.293
Okay.

14:00.295 --> 14:02.662
Good afternoon, Agents.

14:04.967 --> 14:07.334
Agents?
Were you expecting us?

14:07.336 --> 14:10.470
Small town.
Come on in.

14:10.472 --> 14:13.206
Sure. Thanks.

14:31.393 --> 14:33.259
What, you setting up
a science project?

14:33.261 --> 14:35.595
I'm trying different foods
for the snake.

14:35.597 --> 14:37.397
Why?

14:37.399 --> 14:38.898
I think he's sad.

14:40.569 --> 14:43.169
Oh. Have you tried bacon?

14:45.040 --> 14:46.606
Do snakes like bacon?

14:46.608 --> 14:48.908
I don't know.

14:48.910 --> 14:50.677
I like bacon.

14:53.048 --> 14:56.116
Well, anyway,
you and the, uh, snake...

14:58.920 --> 15:01.287
...want to go
for a little dri-ive?

15:01.289 --> 15:02.589
You mean a Hunt.

15:03.592 --> 15:06.459
Uh, more like
a field trip.

15:07.696 --> 15:08.695
Okay.

15:08.697 --> 15:10.563
Yeah. Good. All right.

15:10.565 --> 15:13.466
I'm gonna make some bacon now.

15:18.306 --> 15:19.873
Would you like
some bacon?

15:21.443 --> 15:26.046
This is Conrad's room.
He was such a nice young man.

15:26.048 --> 15:28.648
Oh, what happened to him
is a shame.

15:28.650 --> 15:29.376
Mm.

15:29.400 --> 15:31.409
He'd only been in town
for a few weeks.

15:32.487 --> 15:34.120
Do you have many people
come through here?

15:34.122 --> 15:38.058
Not people. Men.
I only rent to young men.

15:38.060 --> 15:41.661
It's not proper --
young women living alone?

15:41.663 --> 15:45.465
Morals.
You got to have morals.

15:47.069 --> 15:48.401
You know.

15:50.772 --> 15:54.107
Ms. Dowling?
May I have some coffee, please?

15:54.109 --> 15:56.743
Of course, dear.

16:27.075 --> 16:29.242
- Hey. What'd you find?
- Hey.

16:29.244 --> 16:31.945
Love letters that were under
the bed. They're from Sunny.

16:31.947 --> 16:34.714
Sunny. Sunny,
the milkshake waitress?

16:34.716 --> 16:37.984
Yeah, and they're...
surprisingly passionate.

16:37.986 --> 16:39.486
Passionate how?

16:39.488 --> 16:42.756
She spends, uh,
quite a bit of time

16:42.758 --> 16:45.925
talking about the -- the shape
and the heft of his --

16:45.927 --> 16:47.260
Okay!

16:47.262 --> 16:50.530
Got it, yep, passionate.
Understood.

16:50.532 --> 16:53.666
Well, I say we should definitely
check that out tomorrow.

16:53.668 --> 16:54.834
Tomorrow?

16:54.836 --> 16:58.071
Yeah.
It's getting late, Cass.

16:58.073 --> 17:00.607
And you're right.
I-I probably need some rest.

17:00.609 --> 17:03.143
You want to stay here?

17:03.145 --> 17:05.078
Why not?

17:05.079 --> 17:07.814
Ms. Dowling's
making pot roast.

17:11.586 --> 17:15.221
Justin.
Cell phone. Cell.

17:15.223 --> 17:17.723
Cell phone.

17:17.726 --> 17:20.425
Is something wrong,
darling?

17:21.863 --> 17:25.765
I -- I bought
a cell phone.

17:25.767 --> 17:27.166
Hmm?

17:27.169 --> 17:29.636
In Houston.

17:29.638 --> 17:32.105
For my daughter.

17:32.107 --> 17:33.973
Daughter?

17:33.975 --> 17:38.111
My daughter. Rose.

17:38.113 --> 17:40.079
My daughter -- My --

17:42.250 --> 17:43.716
Who are you?

17:44.853 --> 17:47.153
What am I doing here?

17:47.155 --> 17:48.755
What?

17:51.693 --> 17:54.994
This --
This isn't my house!

17:59.234 --> 18:01.100
Honey?

18:04.272 --> 18:07.740
Help! Help!
Somebody help me!

18:07.742 --> 18:10.710
Help! Help me!

18:10.712 --> 18:14.414
Aah! Ohh! Help me!

18:14.416 --> 18:16.449
Aaaah!

18:20.989 --> 18:22.589
Honey?

18:36.450 --> 18:39.350
Why don't you grub up? We still
got another couple hours.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.454
I'm not really hungry.

18:44.124 --> 18:46.291
Well, maybe feed
the snake something.

18:46.293 --> 18:47.525
Yeah. Here.

18:50.564 --> 18:52.697
Give him one of these. I bet
he's never had that before.

18:55.402 --> 18:59.070
I don't think you have a firm
grasp on what snakes eat.

18:59.072 --> 19:00.638
Yeah, no.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.874
Yeah, I always thought they
were kind of cool, though.

19:04.578 --> 19:06.478
Well, most people think
they're dangerous.

19:06.480 --> 19:11.716
Mm. Well, it's not the snake
that's dangerous.

19:11.718 --> 19:14.953
It's their...bite.

19:14.955 --> 19:17.589
Is -- Is that a saying?

19:17.591 --> 19:19.691
It is now.

19:21.461 --> 19:23.928
<i>You</i> try one of those.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.196
Great.

19:57.931 --> 19:59.230

20:17.384 --> 20:19.250

Oh! Agent!

22:11.464 --> 22:12.630
Mrs. Smith.

22:12.632 --> 22:15.166
Please. Come in.

22:15.168 --> 22:17.235
Thank you.

22:23.810 --> 22:25.677
Would you like
a martini?

22:25.679 --> 22:26.978
Uh, no, thank you.

22:26.980 --> 22:28.212
I, um...

22:28.214 --> 22:31.949
I don't mean to
bother you, but I'm, uh --

22:31.951 --> 22:34.252
I'm looking
for my partner.

22:35.955 --> 22:37.555
The tall man.

22:39.192 --> 22:43.461
Hair?
He has beautiful hair?

22:43.463 --> 22:45.797
What?

22:47.400 --> 22:50.935
Uhh.
This is complicated.

22:53.173 --> 22:55.673
Mrs. Smith.

22:55.675 --> 22:57.575
NO!!

23:01.247 --> 23:03.715
That's my husband's chair.

23:04.984 --> 23:08.186
Okay, um,
I think my partner

23:08.188 --> 23:10.221
wanted to talk to you
about your husband.

23:10.223 --> 23:11.723
Justin?
What about him?

23:11.725 --> 23:17.061
I'm so sorry, but last night,
his head, um --

23:17.063 --> 23:20.398
Your husband --
he died last night.

23:23.937 --> 23:27.405
Ohh. I think
you're confused.

23:27.407 --> 23:29.640
Have you already had
your martini today?

23:29.642 --> 23:33.511
N-No, I'm -- I'm not.

23:33.513 --> 23:34.679
He really died.

23:34.681 --> 23:38.216
No, my husband,
he's good.

23:38.218 --> 23:39.550
No, he's not.

23:39.552 --> 23:41.018
Honey?

23:43.389 --> 23:46.090
Is something wrong?

23:46.092 --> 23:49.460
Oh, hi, there.

23:49.462 --> 23:50.862
Agent.

23:50.864 --> 23:54.499
Justin. Justin Smith.
And you are?

23:56.469 --> 23:57.602
Your partner.

23:57.604 --> 24:01.105
Y-- Partner?
Huh! Super!

24:01.107 --> 24:03.374
That's swell. Great.
Tell you what.

24:03.376 --> 24:07.378
Why don't you stick around?
We're having pot roast.

24:14.654 --> 24:15.720
Honey.

24:15.722 --> 24:18.523
Make me a martini?

24:24.330 --> 24:25.997
Who does she think
you are?

24:25.999 --> 24:29.600
Well,
I'm her husband, of course.

24:32.071 --> 24:33.938
This is not your house.

24:37.210 --> 24:40.411
I see. You're right.

24:40.413 --> 24:44.348
This is my wife's house.
I am simply living here.

24:44.350 --> 24:46.484
- Oh, you!
- Oh, <i>you!</i>

24:46.486 --> 24:48.586
Oh, no.

24:48.588 --> 24:50.721
Something terrible's
happened.

24:52.058 --> 24:54.592
Hon, we're low
on olives.

24:54.594 --> 24:56.327
- Well, that <i>is</i> terrible.
- One or two?

24:56.329 --> 24:57.829
Uh, three?

24:58.798 --> 25:01.232
I'm feeling adventurous.

25:01.234 --> 25:02.800
Rowr!

25:02.802 --> 25:04.936
Rar.

25:08.041 --> 25:09.707
Would you like one?

25:09.709 --> 25:13.177
Your name
is Sam Winchester.

25:13.179 --> 25:16.013
So that's a no-no on the hooch?

25:16.015 --> 25:17.882
Sam, I don't know
what's happened.

25:17.884 --> 25:20.117
I don't know if this is a spell or a curse
or -- or what's happened,

25:20.119 --> 25:23.855
but you will snap
the hell out of it!

25:23.857 --> 25:26.858
Sir, you watch your mouth.

25:26.860 --> 25:29.427
If we cannot remain civil,
then you can skedaddle.

25:29.429 --> 25:31.395
- Sam --
- That's not my name!

25:31.397 --> 25:34.465
- Cindy, grab his hat!
- I don't wear a hat!

25:34.467 --> 25:36.177
Honey, I don't
think he wore a hat!

25:36.201 --> 25:37.436
Fine!

25:37.437 --> 25:43.207
Sir, using language like, uh,
"H-E-double hockey sticks" --

25:43.209 --> 25:45.977
You should have your mouth
washed out with soap.

25:45.979 --> 25:47.011
Sam --

25:47.013 --> 25:49.680
- It's Justin.
- I'm gonna --

25:53.586 --> 25:56.120
Double hockey sticks?

26:10.978 --> 26:12.912
Dean!

26:12.914 --> 26:14.580
Jack!
Great to see you!

26:14.582 --> 26:16.816
Donny, good to see you
up and around.

26:16.818 --> 26:18.884
Ah, I am just
the picture of health.

26:18.886 --> 26:22.455
Except for my prostate.
It's shaped like a papaya.

26:22.457 --> 26:24.390
Wow.

26:24.392 --> 26:26.759
Our field trip
is to see Donatello?

26:26.761 --> 26:31.030
Well, with this whole
soul thing, it's, uh --

26:31.032 --> 26:33.599
We're worried
about you, okay?

26:33.601 --> 26:37.002
And when it comes to souls
or...not having them,

26:37.004 --> 26:38.571
Donny here's an expert.

26:39.774 --> 26:42.575
He is?

26:42.577 --> 26:44.443
Please.
Come on in.

26:44.445 --> 26:46.045
Actually, you know what?
I'm gonna --

26:46.047 --> 26:47.379
I'm gonna
let you guys talk.

26:47.381 --> 26:49.381
I'll, uh, keep an eye
on the snake.

26:51.486 --> 26:53.586
Okay.
Come on, Jack.

27:26.020 --> 27:28.220
So, you took this snake in,

27:28.222 --> 27:30.456
and now it gets to go
on road trips?

27:30.458 --> 27:33.092
Fun!

27:35.029 --> 27:36.362
Can I ask you something?

27:36.364 --> 27:38.264
That's what you're here for,
isn't it?

27:40.301 --> 27:42.001
How did you lose
your soul?

27:43.604 --> 27:46.071
God's sister ripped it
right out of me.

27:46.073 --> 27:50.776
That...
wasn't my best day.

27:50.778 --> 27:54.914
But oddly, it wasn't
my worst day, either.

27:58.019 --> 28:01.520
And when it was gone,

28:01.522 --> 28:04.023
how did you --
how'd you feel?

28:04.025 --> 28:06.192
Like...

28:12.099 --> 28:13.832
...the galaxy.

28:16.804 --> 28:19.405
You know, Jack,
our galaxy's

28:19.407 --> 28:23.375
all bright and shiny
and spinny,

28:23.377 --> 28:29.548
but in its center lies
this very large black hole.

28:35.923 --> 28:37.756
It's the same with me.

28:37.758 --> 28:40.759
I'm all bright and shiny,
obviously --

28:40.761 --> 28:44.330
Not so much spinny.

28:44.332 --> 28:45.798
But inside?

28:49.003 --> 28:50.169
Empty.

28:50.171 --> 28:53.038
So you feel bad?

28:54.842 --> 28:57.977
I feel...

28:57.979 --> 28:59.211
nothing.

28:59.213 --> 29:02.548
Losing your soul
doesn't make you bad.

29:02.550 --> 29:04.450
It doesn't
make you anything.

29:04.452 --> 29:07.353
It's, um...

29:07.355 --> 29:09.822
an absence of...

29:09.824 --> 29:13.492
of pity, of empathy...

29:15.096 --> 29:16.729
...of humanity.

29:22.837 --> 29:24.303
How do you feel, Jack?

29:32.146 --> 29:33.579
I don't know.

29:33.581 --> 29:37.416
I know I don't
feel...nothing,

29:37.418 --> 29:42.421
but I don't feel
the same, either.

29:42.423 --> 29:47.126
And maybe I just don't know
what nothing feels like.

29:49.363 --> 29:53.432
Mostly, I just don't want Sam
and Dean and Cass to worry.

29:54.669 --> 29:57.336
They're your family.
Families worry.

29:57.338 --> 30:01.040
But I just --
I need time and space

30:01.042 --> 30:03.309
to figure things out
on my own,

30:03.311 --> 30:04.460
but everywhere I go,

30:04.484 --> 30:06.484
there's someone looking
over my shoulder.

30:06.814 --> 30:08.847
Ah.

30:08.849 --> 30:14.386
When I need to, uh, "blend,"
I ask myself,

30:14.388 --> 30:16.655
"What would
Mr. Rogers do?"

30:17.992 --> 30:19.591
Who's Mr. Rogers?

30:19.593 --> 30:21.960
The best man I know.

30:24.932 --> 30:26.932
Sam and Dean
are the best men I know.

30:26.934 --> 30:30.869
So, ergo, whenever you don't
want them to worry,

30:30.871 --> 30:35.207
just think "WWWD" --

30:35.209 --> 30:37.276
"What Would
the Winchesters Do?"

30:37.278 --> 30:40.612
I can do that.

30:50.224 --> 30:51.590
Well, there they are.

30:51.592 --> 30:52.991
How's the snake?

30:52.993 --> 30:55.127
He's good.
Might be hungry.

30:55.129 --> 30:56.662
Okay.

30:59.400 --> 31:02.634
So, what's the verdict?
Does he have a soul?

31:02.636 --> 31:06.872
I suppose the first question
we must ask ourselves is,

31:06.874 --> 31:08.173
what <i>is</i> a soul?

31:08.175 --> 31:09.475
Donny.

31:09.477 --> 31:10.642
What?

31:10.644 --> 31:13.312
I'm sorry.

31:13.314 --> 31:16.448
Um, I'd keep an eye on him,

31:16.450 --> 31:21.487
but I think if he seems okay,
he probably is.

31:22.790 --> 31:23.922
So he's not like you?

31:23.924 --> 31:25.624
Oh, no.

31:25.626 --> 31:28.293
I'm a Prophet of the Lord,
but he --

31:30.164 --> 31:35.401
Jack's probably the most
powerful being in the universe.

31:35.403 --> 31:41.106
I mean, really, who knows
what's going on inside his head?

31:51.218 --> 31:53.218
Thanks.

32:03.697 --> 32:05.497
I think we should talk.

32:05.499 --> 32:08.333
I, uh --
Okay. About what?

32:08.335 --> 32:10.335
About how you're a witch.

32:10.337 --> 32:12.070
A witch?

32:12.072 --> 32:13.772
About how you
brainwashed my friend

32:13.774 --> 32:16.942
and about how you've done
something to this entire town.

32:16.944 --> 32:19.478
I don't know what
you're talking about.

32:19.480 --> 32:21.079
Oh, yes, you do.

32:21.081 --> 32:22.581
You wrote these.

32:23.984 --> 32:27.085
You wrote them to Conrad.

32:27.087 --> 32:33.025
And between various
steamy, erotic musings,

32:33.027 --> 32:35.360
you begged him to leave.

32:35.362 --> 32:38.197
Why is that? Because you
were afraid you'd hurt him?

32:38.199 --> 32:39.965
You don't know what
you're talking about.

32:39.967 --> 32:41.233
Okay, then tell me.

32:43.604 --> 32:47.539
Tell me, or I'll rip it
from your mind.

32:49.343 --> 32:50.876
Fine.

32:50.878 --> 32:52.511
Have it your way.

32:52.513 --> 32:55.814
No, no, please! It's not me!
It's him! He's out of control!

32:55.816 --> 32:59.685
Well, now...

32:59.687 --> 33:01.453
That's not very nice.

33:09.875 --> 33:11.407
So <i>you</i> did this.

33:11.409 --> 33:13.176
What, did you think
it was the milkshakes?

33:14.679 --> 33:16.279
What are you?

33:16.281 --> 33:19.282
Well, I like to think of myself
as a kind of Good Samaritan.

33:19.284 --> 33:20.950
You know, I've always been
lucky. I've always had

33:20.952 --> 33:24.354
an intuition about what people
are gonna do or say.

33:24.356 --> 33:26.890
Made me the king
of poker night.

33:26.892 --> 33:30.293
But then the mill shut down,

33:30.295 --> 33:34.631
and this town -- the town
I love -- had started to die.

33:34.633 --> 33:37.367
Then my sweet wife,
she passed away.

33:37.369 --> 33:39.235
And the world kept
gettin' worse,

33:39.237 --> 33:41.037
and they called it
"modernization,"

33:41.039 --> 33:42.805
and no matter what I did,
people would turn

33:42.807 --> 33:45.708
to drink or drugs,
they'd move away.

33:45.710 --> 33:48.578
They just weren't happy.

33:50.849 --> 33:52.982
Things kept getting worse,

33:52.984 --> 33:55.818
and I started to hear
noises -- voices.

33:55.820 --> 33:57.620
And I screamed
at these voices!

33:57.622 --> 34:03.159
I said, "Just make
things better!"

34:03.161 --> 34:04.861
And you know
what happened next?

34:04.863 --> 34:07.630
No, but I have a feeling
you're gonna tell me.

34:09.100 --> 34:13.303
The very next day, I thought --
just thought --

34:13.304 --> 34:16.239
"I wish there was more people
in the soda shop."

34:16.241 --> 34:20.376
And I came in here that day,
and it was packed.

34:20.378 --> 34:25.248
And that's when
I figured it out.

34:25.250 --> 34:30.585
I can make people do
whatever I want.

34:30.588 --> 34:33.489
So you're some kind of
mind-control psychic?

34:35.827 --> 34:38.261
I re-made this town.

34:38.263 --> 34:41.797
I gave everybody
new names, new lives.

34:41.800 --> 34:44.233
I made everybody happy.

34:44.235 --> 34:48.103
Well, most everybody, and, uh,
the ones who fought it, well --

34:48.106 --> 34:49.806
You'd murder them.

34:51.342 --> 34:54.476
I was just
protecting my home!

34:54.478 --> 34:56.411
And you -- you knew
all about this.

34:56.414 --> 34:59.582
Well, she knew enough
to play along,

34:59.584 --> 35:03.486
but, uh...my tricks
never worked on Sunny.

35:03.488 --> 35:06.889
She's too much like me.

35:06.891 --> 35:11.160
I am <i>nothing</i> like you.

35:12.897 --> 35:16.666
But you.
Why can't I change you?

35:16.668 --> 35:18.301
Because I'm not human.

35:19.337 --> 35:22.205
Oh.

35:22.207 --> 35:24.107
Well...

35:24.109 --> 35:25.875
Gentlemen?

35:25.877 --> 35:27.176
Sunny!

35:28.513 --> 35:30.680
- Sunny!
-Get away from me!

35:30.682 --> 35:32.181
I won't hurt you, Sam.

35:32.183 --> 35:35.418
Golly, I told you
my name is Justin!

35:43.161 --> 35:46.029
- You killed Conrad!
- No!

35:46.031 --> 35:49.132
You told him the truth,
and that's why he ran,

35:49.134 --> 35:51.100
and that's why I did
what I had to do.

35:51.102 --> 35:53.536
No, you killed that boy, Sunny,
not me.

35:53.538 --> 35:54.904
I didn't.

36:02.447 --> 36:03.946
Aah!

36:16.061 --> 36:17.460
Fight this!

36:17.462 --> 36:20.863
Why? I'm happy
in Charming Acres.

36:20.865 --> 36:22.131
We're <i>all</i> happy.

36:22.133 --> 36:24.434
Sam, I know
you want to be happy.

36:24.436 --> 36:27.804
And I know what it's like
to lose your army.

36:27.806 --> 36:29.605
I know what it's like...

36:29.607 --> 36:32.241
...to fail
as a leader, Sam.

36:32.243 --> 36:35.278
But you can't lose yourself.
You have to keep fighting.

36:35.280 --> 36:37.914
You can't lose yourself,
because if you do, you fail us.

36:37.916 --> 36:41.484
You fail all of those
that we've lost.

36:41.486 --> 36:42.885
You fail Jack.

36:42.887 --> 36:45.955
Sam, you fail Dean.

36:49.294 --> 36:50.693
You're sick.

36:50.695 --> 36:53.996
Well, but you stayed.
You didn't even try and stop me.

36:59.604 --> 37:02.438
- Sam.
- Cass?

37:03.975 --> 37:08.077
I promised Mom that I wouldn't
leave you, but you're a monster.

37:09.247 --> 37:11.280
No. No.

37:11.282 --> 37:13.616
In this town, I'm God.

37:14.352 --> 37:18.754
No. You're not.
Believe me. We've met God.

37:18.756 --> 37:20.389
God has a beard.

37:27.665 --> 37:29.866
No!

37:33.204 --> 37:35.104
Sorry, sport.

37:35.106 --> 37:37.306
Stop!

37:38.576 --> 37:40.409
I said stop!

37:52.023 --> 37:56.359
You see? I told you!
You're just like me!

37:56.361 --> 38:00.463
No. You hurt
innocent people.

38:00.465 --> 38:03.699
You want to be happy?

38:03.701 --> 38:06.269
Then be happy!

38:13.211 --> 38:15.178
W-What did you do?

38:15.180 --> 38:19.115
I -- I don't --

38:19.117 --> 38:20.516
I...

38:25.123 --> 38:26.789
She made him happy.

38:26.791 --> 38:30.493
Your father is trapped
inside his own mind.

38:31.362 --> 38:33.896
He's in a world that --

38:35.500 --> 38:37.767
It's a beautiful world.

38:37.769 --> 38:41.070
But it's a place where he can
never hurt anyone again.

38:45.944 --> 38:48.010
Good.

38:56.889 --> 38:58.856
Well, it seemed like
the snake enjoyed the trip.

38:58.858 --> 39:01.692
Hard to say.
He's, uh, very guarded.

39:01.694 --> 39:03.594
Yeah. Yeah.

39:05.231 --> 39:07.765
And what about you, huh?
Good time?

39:08.901 --> 39:12.369
It was...illuminating.

39:13.740 --> 39:15.272
Oh.

39:21.347 --> 39:24.048
Hey! How was Arkansas?

39:24.050 --> 39:26.650
Arkansas was, uh...

39:29.055 --> 39:31.789
It was...weird.

39:31.791 --> 39:33.624
Heard you wore
a cardigan.

39:36.429 --> 39:38.696
Yeah, I told him
about the cardigan.

39:38.698 --> 39:40.397
Great. Thanks.

39:40.399 --> 39:41.565
And the wife.

39:43.202 --> 39:46.403
He said you were,
uh, really happy.

39:46.405 --> 39:48.539
Thanks. Yeah.

39:48.541 --> 39:50.608
Where's Jack?

39:50.610 --> 39:51.709
His room.

39:55.148 --> 39:57.648
Really happy, huh?

39:57.650 --> 39:59.950
I mean, I guess
I was happy, but...

39:59.952 --> 40:03.120
It wasn't real, you know?

40:03.122 --> 40:05.189
Just...

40:06.425 --> 40:09.660
Well, not a lot of happy
goin' on around here.

40:13.099 --> 40:15.232
I hate this place
right now.

40:15.234 --> 40:17.034
I hate it.

40:17.036 --> 40:19.403
Everywhere I look,
I see them.

40:19.405 --> 40:20.738
I see Maggie.

40:21.874 --> 40:25.009
I guess that's why, uh --
why I was so desperate

40:25.011 --> 40:27.878
to get out of here,
why I kept running us ragged.

40:30.349 --> 40:33.918
But I got to stop that.
I-I can't keep running. I --

40:37.156 --> 40:40.457
This is my home.
This is our home.

40:44.130 --> 40:46.430
Dean, I think
I just need some time.

40:49.902 --> 40:51.168
Okay.

41:03.916 --> 41:06.350
Cass says
you miss your friend.

41:06.352 --> 41:08.886
You need help.

41:08.888 --> 41:13.757
Sam and Dean would help you,
so -- so I'll help you.

41:16.028 --> 41:19.230
I'll help you
see your friend again.

41:22.668 --> 41:24.401
In Heaven.
