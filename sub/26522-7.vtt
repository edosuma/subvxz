WEBVTT

01:37.514 --> 01:39.182
Sorry about that.

01:42.727 --> 01:44.395
Did you say you took cream or sugar?

01:44.979 --> 01:45.814
Yeah.

01:46.272 --> 01:47.857
Shoot. I forgot 'em.

01:48.316 --> 01:51.402
-I'll run and grab 'em. Sorry about that.
-You don't have to do that.

01:51.486 --> 01:52.737
Oh, it's no problem.

01:53.238 --> 01:54.239
The clothes okay?

01:55.240 --> 01:56.825
Sorry, that's all we had on hand.

01:57.575 --> 02:00.662
And yours, well, if there's blood on 'em,
we have to take 'em.

02:01.371 --> 02:02.288
You understand.

02:04.290 --> 02:06.292
How much longer is this going to take?

02:07.168 --> 02:09.045
We just need to go over a few things.

02:09.879 --> 02:12.173
And I want to revisit
your initial statement.

02:12.674 --> 02:15.301
Again, thank you
for doing this voluntarily.

02:16.427 --> 02:18.388
I got to get back to my kids.

02:18.555 --> 02:20.557
Your kids are fine,
I just checked on 'em.

02:20.890 --> 02:22.392
They're with their Aunt Janet.

02:23.393 --> 02:25.395
You know, you can leave
whenever you want.

02:25.770 --> 02:27.897
I told you that, right? You know that.

02:28.857 --> 02:29.983
-Yes.
-It's just--

02:30.066 --> 02:32.694
To be honest, it wouldn't look so good.

02:33.486 --> 02:35.864
I wanna make sure that
when you do walk out of here,

02:35.947 --> 02:37.282
whenever you walk out of here,

02:37.365 --> 02:39.868
that you walk without a whiff
of suspicion on you.

02:39.951 --> 02:40.910
You understand.

02:41.452 --> 02:42.287
Yes.

02:42.745 --> 02:44.164
Beyond reproach.

02:44.622 --> 02:46.082
We both want that, right?

02:46.207 --> 02:47.083
Of course.

02:47.292 --> 02:49.335
We just need to go over it
a few times.

02:49.419 --> 02:52.589
In particular, I'd like to talk about
what you said about the house.

02:52.672 --> 02:53.548
What about it?

02:53.631 --> 02:55.758
You mentioned a few things
to the officers.

02:55.842 --> 02:58.887
I've been up all night.
I've probably said some crazy stuff.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.890
Of course, I understand that.
We all understand that.

03:03.099 --> 03:04.392
And I'm not under arrest?

03:04.726 --> 03:06.853
Oh, no. You are not.

03:07.395 --> 03:08.271
My guys...

03:09.105 --> 03:10.481
are at the house right now,

03:10.565 --> 03:12.483
and my guys are talking to the, uh...

03:13.443 --> 03:15.737
What are their names

03:15.987 --> 03:18.198
Uh, the Dudleys, I believe?

03:19.365 --> 03:22.911
And your wife, she's with
the medical examiner right now, and...

03:23.703 --> 03:24.662
it's a mess.

03:25.997 --> 03:28.249
I got to be honest, Hugh, it's a mess.

03:28.333 --> 03:29.375
It's a real mess.

03:30.585 --> 03:33.463
Your kids are being pulled out of bed
in the middle of the night,

03:33.546 --> 03:35.006
and we're talking to them, of course.

03:36.132 --> 03:37.800
You know it's a mess, right?

03:39.469 --> 03:43.014
-We haven't talked about the other body.
-That didn't have anything to do with us.

03:43.097 --> 03:45.892
Of course not,
but you can fix it right here.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.478
You like to fix things.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.563
You're good at fixing things.

03:50.647 --> 03:52.857
I keep hearing this about you.
Is that right?

03:53.441 --> 03:54.817
I'm not so sure anymore.

03:54.984 --> 03:58.571
You leave or lawyer up,
suddenly we can't fix this.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.741
This mess begins to spread,

04:01.824 --> 04:04.369
until it becomes bigger
than both of us.

04:05.995 --> 04:06.913
So you'll stay.

04:07.664 --> 04:08.790
And we'll talk.

04:08.873 --> 04:09.707
Yeah?

04:10.250 --> 04:12.460
Talk about the house,
talk about Olivia.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.922
Talk about what happened last night.

04:18.591 --> 04:19.425
Good.

04:21.052 --> 04:23.596
I will run and get you
your cream and sugar.

04:23.680 --> 04:24.931
I don't need it.

04:25.014 --> 04:27.642
-We can talk now and get this over with.
-Sit tight.

04:29.560 --> 04:30.520
It's no trouble.

04:33.648 --> 04:34.565
It's no trouble.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.042
Why

04:54.961 --> 04:57.255
Well, you know, it's a rental.

04:58.673 --> 05:00.049
Not a lot of choices.

05:00.842 --> 05:01.676
Yeah.

05:02.552 --> 05:03.678
How about this?

05:05.638 --> 05:06.472
Yeah.

05:07.598 --> 05:08.433
Um...

05:09.100 --> 05:09.934
Here.

05:11.769 --> 05:12.645
Hmm?

05:13.896 --> 05:16.482
Yeah? All right, well, uh...

05:19.444 --> 05:20.361
Yeah.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.363
Yeah, all right.

05:23.906 --> 05:24.949
You're right.

05:25.491 --> 05:26.367
It's better.

05:37.628 --> 05:38.463
Hmm?

05:45.887 --> 05:48.723
I put this order
in two days ago. Calla Lilies.

05:48.806 --> 05:51.726
You promised me Calla Lilies,
you're bringing me Calla Lilies.

05:52.310 --> 05:54.187
You're really our grandfather?

05:54.270 --> 05:55.188
That's right.

05:55.271 --> 05:57.148
How come we've never met you?

05:57.231 --> 06:00.234
I don't care about their order,
I'm talking about my order.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.694
Look, you--

06:01.778 --> 06:05.448
-You've done business with me enough...
-Actually, I met Jayden a while back.

06:06.324 --> 06:08.368
I don't remember that.

06:08.451 --> 06:10.661
Well, you were, um,
you were really little.

06:11.788 --> 06:15.416
How come I've never met you You're not hearing me.

06:16.959 --> 06:18.044
That won't--

06:19.295 --> 06:21.923
Where have you been?
You missed breakfast.

06:24.467 --> 06:27.387
Kevin's on his way.
We'll take the four, that's fine.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.473
There better be four bouquets
of Calla Lilies for him when he lands

06:30.556 --> 06:33.393
or you can forget about doing business
with us ever again.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.063
Jayden, Allie, go get dressed.

06:37.146 --> 06:39.107
-I'm not finished--
-Dressed.

06:41.943 --> 06:45.446
-Um, can we please talk?
-Everett screwed us.

06:45.988 --> 06:49.575
Gave half our lilies away.
You need to pick up for four bouquets.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.161
I'll go in a minute,
but can we just--?

06:52.245 --> 06:53.704
You're already on your way.

06:53.955 --> 06:56.958
I have to shower and change my clothes.
I didn't bring any of my--

06:57.041 --> 06:57.959
Okay.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.088
I, um...

07:04.757 --> 07:07.343
I saw your husband at the hotel
this morning.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.470
He was picking at the free breakfast.

07:11.180 --> 07:14.058
I know you're upset with him
'cause he took Steve's money,

07:14.142 --> 07:16.853
but he was only looking out
for you and business--

07:16.936 --> 07:19.439
00. It's 8:30.

07:19.897 --> 07:21.023
We're not open yet.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.610
If you wanna lecture someone,
lecture Theo.

07:29.824 --> 07:31.492
Wonder where she gets that from.

07:32.785 --> 07:35.329
I needed my space, but not like Shirl.

07:36.873 --> 07:39.250
Since she was three years old,
Shirley needed...

07:39.500 --> 07:40.793
Shirley space.

07:42.503 --> 07:44.338
-Mmm.
-Bear with her.

07:45.673 --> 07:46.883
Today, especially.

07:47.091 --> 07:48.718
Just bear with her.

07:55.141 --> 07:56.225
What a mess.

07:56.684 --> 07:58.019
Oh, what a mess.

07:58.352 --> 08:00.688
Never seen a storm make a mess like this.

08:02.023 --> 08:03.441
It really missed you guys?

08:03.900 --> 08:05.359
A little rain, that was all.

08:07.278 --> 08:09.947
Your place is, what,
like a ten-minute walk from here?

08:10.031 --> 08:11.115
A little more.

08:13.284 --> 08:15.036
Didn't even hit the whole property.

08:16.787 --> 08:18.748
Wondering if it's one of those micro...

08:19.499 --> 08:20.333
Hey, bud.

08:21.792 --> 08:23.669
Wondering if it's one
of those microbursts.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.379
-You ever hear of those?
-Uh-uh.

08:25.463 --> 08:29.050
It's a downdraft, it moves like a tornado,
but it's super localized.

08:29.383 --> 08:31.302
Maybe like two miles wide.

08:31.677 --> 08:34.972
One of the most dangerous storms,
but it hits a really small area.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.017
-Dad?
-It's gotta be that, I think.

08:38.768 --> 08:41.437
I mean, it feels like it only hit
this house.

08:41.896 --> 08:42.813
Dad?

08:43.105 --> 08:44.398
This wall feels squishy.

08:45.441 --> 08:46.526
What?

08:47.068 --> 08:47.902
See?

08:55.993 --> 08:57.537
Oh, shit.

09:02.792 --> 09:03.709
Mark it.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.551
No way all this came from a storm.

09:11.634 --> 09:12.760
No, no way.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.555
Busted pipe, most likely.

09:15.638 --> 09:17.723
It shouldn't be. It really shouldn't be.

09:17.848 --> 09:19.392
I mean, we took care of all...

09:23.479 --> 09:24.855
If it is, it's okay.

09:29.610 --> 09:30.570
I can fix it.

09:39.704 --> 09:40.621
What's that smell?

09:41.789 --> 09:43.833
That is the smell of ruin.

09:44.458 --> 09:45.293
Mold.

09:45.376 --> 09:46.460
Same thing.

09:47.753 --> 09:48.588
It can't.

09:48.963 --> 09:52.008
The storm was just last night.
It can't be all the way down here.

09:52.091 --> 09:53.217
It can't be down here.

09:53.676 --> 09:55.303
Please don't be down here.

09:59.307 --> 10:00.558
What does that mean?

10:01.767 --> 10:05.146
Means we got water pooling all the way
down here, three floors down.

10:05.813 --> 10:07.440
That's really bad.

10:07.940 --> 10:09.692
Mother f--

10:11.485 --> 10:12.528
Fother mucker.

10:13.195 --> 10:14.030
Really, Dad?

10:24.457 --> 10:25.291
Yup.

10:26.876 --> 10:29.420
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

10:42.975 --> 10:44.894
Stevie, why don't you go on upstairs?

10:45.478 --> 10:46.520
I want to help.

10:46.896 --> 10:49.190
This is black mold,
it's dangerous to breathe.

10:49.315 --> 10:50.650
So go along now.

11:09.543 --> 11:10.503
Do you hear that?

11:25.559 --> 11:26.769
Maybe rats.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.355
Could be what happened to the pipes.

11:29.980 --> 11:33.484
When rats get thirsty enough,
they'll chew through just about anything.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.165
This could ruin us.

11:50.668 --> 11:51.585
This could.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.057
Hey.

12:05.266 --> 12:07.852
I'm a little early for the...

12:08.686 --> 12:09.603
You know.

12:10.730 --> 12:13.107
And Shirley doesn't want people
in the house just yet,

12:13.190 --> 12:14.525
so I thought maybe I'd say hi.

12:14.608 --> 12:16.861
Yeah, I bet Shirl's in a mood.

12:19.196 --> 12:20.239
Can I come in?

12:29.248 --> 12:31.333
I remember when Luke lived here.

12:34.670 --> 12:37.173
I was really hoping that it would work.

12:38.215 --> 12:40.259
I thought if anybody could, you know...

12:41.594 --> 12:42.470
just...

12:42.928 --> 12:45.055
keep him on track, it'd be your sister.

12:45.139 --> 12:45.973
Mm-hm.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.976
But he's looking a lot better now.

12:49.435 --> 12:50.352
Right

12:50.895 --> 12:52.062
Guess so.

12:54.398 --> 12:56.776
-You, on the other hand...
-Thanks, Dad.

12:56.859 --> 12:59.236
No, it's just, you look a little, uh...

12:59.987 --> 13:01.530
The...

13:02.239 --> 13:04.867
I'm just-- You know, I've woken up
plenty of mornings

13:04.950 --> 13:06.744
looking like that myself, I'm just--

13:06.827 --> 13:08.537
I fucked up last night, Daddy.

13:10.247 --> 13:11.290
I mean, I really...

13:13.125 --> 13:14.752
I fucked up.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.588
Even by Crain standards.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.466
If I make it through today alive,

13:20.549 --> 13:23.511
I'll have to pack this all up
and find a new place to live.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.431
And I don't think Shirley is

13:28.098 --> 13:29.809
ever going to talk to me again.

13:36.774 --> 13:37.733
I'm sorry.

13:38.859 --> 13:41.070
I should have made more of an effort
with you.

13:43.572 --> 13:44.448
You tried.

13:45.282 --> 13:46.492
As best as you could.

13:47.701 --> 13:48.577
And I...

13:49.078 --> 13:50.704
I should have met you halfway.

13:53.999 --> 13:55.000
People fuck up.

13:57.127 --> 13:58.087
I guess you don't...

13:58.671 --> 14:00.506
get that, you don't really get it...

14:01.966 --> 14:03.133
until you fuck up.

14:05.386 --> 14:06.929
Really fuck up.

14:12.643 --> 14:15.020
This doesn't have to do
with Steve's money, does it?

14:22.486 --> 14:23.445
I have to shower.

14:23.737 --> 14:24.572
Um...

14:24.989 --> 14:26.657
-Yeah, um--
-You can stay.

14:27.616 --> 14:28.534
Sit.

14:28.868 --> 14:29.827
Enjoy your coffee.

14:38.419 --> 14:39.795
I didn't expect that.

14:41.297 --> 14:42.631
Gotta start somewhere.

14:44.383 --> 14:45.384
That's a good start.

14:47.469 --> 14:49.013
You were always good at that.

14:49.597 --> 14:51.098
Assessing the damage.

14:52.808 --> 14:54.602
Where is it

14:54.727 --> 14:57.104
Second floor hallway
behind the library wall,

14:57.396 --> 14:59.565
-master bedroom.
-You're kidding.

15:02.401 --> 15:03.485
Downstairs.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.822
The parlor, library,

15:06.906 --> 15:09.617
and then the pooling in the basement,
there are veins of it,

15:09.700 --> 15:13.495
veins of mold that are spreading
from somewhere on the third floor.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.331
-It's all over.
-It doesn't make sense.

15:15.414 --> 15:17.207
-The waterlines don't even--
-I know.

15:17.499 --> 15:19.585
I mean, I can't think of a water source

15:19.668 --> 15:22.129
that explains it spreading
like that down there.

15:22.379 --> 15:24.548
-Gonna lose our shirts.

15:24.632 --> 15:26.842
The blueprints for this house
are a disaster.

15:26.926 --> 15:30.179
I've got four plans, none of them match.
This house is schizophrenic.

15:30.262 --> 15:33.432
Some of them are just scribbles
and the work records are a mess.

15:33.515 --> 15:36.101
I can't flip this house
if it's rotting with mold.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.979
And if I can't flip it
in a couple of months,

15:39.063 --> 15:41.774
-we'll be stuck here.
-I know, I know, I will, um...

15:42.650 --> 15:46.111
I'll combine these plans
into one master blueprint, uh,

15:46.403 --> 15:48.989
draw up something that represents
the actual piping,

15:49.907 --> 15:52.076
and then we'll find out
how fucked we really are.

15:52.159 --> 15:56.038
It's bizarre. I can't really identify
a leak and I'm not finding water.

15:56.246 --> 15:57.581
That's something, at least.

15:57.665 --> 15:59.291
You got moisture coming from somewhere.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.001
Somewhere upstairs,
the way it's spreading.

16:01.085 --> 16:02.795
Have you actually looked everywhere?

16:03.170 --> 16:06.256
Everywhere but one room.
There's one room we don't have a key.

16:07.508 --> 16:09.301
I've checked everywhere but one room.

16:09.385 --> 16:10.928
That's probably your culprit.

16:11.011 --> 16:13.597
We were wondering,
did rats get through a pipe?

16:14.139 --> 16:16.100
Have to be a lot of rats,
several pipes.

16:16.642 --> 16:19.186
I don't see any droppings.
Have you actually seen rats?

16:19.520 --> 16:22.231
Well, I keep hearing them scratching here.

16:25.067 --> 16:27.486
So of course it's quiet now.

16:27.987 --> 16:31.407
We section off the infested walls,
bring in fans to dry everything out,

16:31.490 --> 16:33.117
treat it with Thiomold, powerful stuff,

16:33.200 --> 16:36.161
then we can see how bad off you are,
once you find the leaks.

16:37.287 --> 16:41.667
My budget's stretched as it is, so maybe
you can give me a quote for fan rental.

16:42.459 --> 16:44.169
It's a big job for one person.

16:44.253 --> 16:45.337
Well, I've got help.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.715
-What do you say, Steve?
-Yeah.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.174
Yeah, I'll help.

16:49.258 --> 16:50.968
It's a tough gig for a kid.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.428
Oh, he's not a kid.

17:11.196 --> 17:12.406
Don't say that.

17:13.824 --> 17:14.867
-What?

17:16.160 --> 17:18.287
That you wish he'd had better role models.

17:19.288 --> 17:21.248
A better marriage to emulate.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.042
We were solid, babe.

17:23.709 --> 17:24.543
We were.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.046
Those last few days don't count.

17:27.755 --> 17:28.756
That wasn't us.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.217
Hmm.

17:33.761 --> 17:34.636
Mmm.

17:41.060 --> 17:41.977
Leigh.

17:43.145 --> 17:44.146
Everything okay?

17:44.938 --> 17:46.523
Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

17:46.607 --> 17:47.900
How are you holding up?

17:49.443 --> 17:51.070
Oh, you know, um..

18:13.092 --> 18:13.967
Hi.

18:15.135 --> 18:16.220
-Hey.
-Hey.

18:18.555 --> 18:19.515
How you doing?

18:21.475 --> 18:22.643
You know.

18:25.062 --> 18:28.607
I didn't get a chance last night
to tell you how proud I am of you.

18:28.857 --> 18:29.858
Ninety days.

18:30.442 --> 18:31.443
Thanks.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.281
He doesn't wanna make today about him.

18:37.074 --> 18:38.408
It's okay to just sit.

18:39.576 --> 18:40.619
Just be with him.

18:41.578 --> 18:42.788
You don't have to talk.

18:47.709 --> 18:48.877
There's a lot-- Uh...

18:49.211 --> 18:50.754
There's a lot of people here.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.465
-That's good.
-Mm-hmm.

18:54.258 --> 18:55.968
A lot of people loved her.

18:59.096 --> 19:00.597
Yeah.

19:12.526 --> 19:13.402
Hey, boys.

19:20.367 --> 19:21.910
Beer and tomato juice.

19:23.620 --> 19:24.496
What?

19:24.580 --> 19:25.747
For the hangover.

19:25.831 --> 19:28.208
Mix beer and tomato juice
and power it down.

19:30.502 --> 19:31.420
Does it work?

19:33.088 --> 19:35.090
Well, not as well as a shot of smack.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.595
So you're saying the best hangover remedy
is heroin?

19:41.388 --> 19:42.931
By a mile.

19:50.772 --> 19:52.274
Are you fucking kidding me?

19:55.527 --> 19:56.737
What are you doing here?

19:58.197 --> 20:00.616
I saw the obit
and I wanted to be here--

20:00.699 --> 20:02.492
You thought you'd what, exactly?

20:03.035 --> 20:05.412
Well, you didn't tell me that
your sister died.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.748
I wanted to support you,
and if I'd known--

20:07.831 --> 20:10.250
If I wanted you to know that
I'd have told you that.

20:12.085 --> 20:13.503
Look, it's okay, I...

20:15.005 --> 20:16.006
I'm sorry.

20:18.884 --> 20:20.052
Fuck my day.

20:26.058 --> 20:26.892
Hey.

20:34.483 --> 20:36.860
I'm guessing you heard what happened
at the wedding.

20:37.486 --> 20:38.445
You know...

20:38.987 --> 20:41.657
Nellie, she was laughing so hard
when she told me.

20:42.449 --> 20:44.451
Oh, yeah. We knew.

20:45.994 --> 20:47.162
Your mom, uh...

20:48.372 --> 20:50.916
Yeah, she... she guessed it

20:52.793 --> 20:54.294
when Theo was about eight.

20:56.338 --> 20:57.256
Yeah.

20:57.756 --> 20:59.091
-Huh.
-Oh, yeah.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.014
My sweet boy.

21:11.687 --> 21:12.729
There she is.

21:14.606 --> 21:16.692
-What happened to you?
-Oh, I fell.

21:16.775 --> 21:18.193
-Hey.
-Hi.

21:18.735 --> 21:20.153
You knew she'd be here.

21:20.320 --> 21:21.238
Ah...

21:22.781 --> 21:23.615
Yeah.

21:25.993 --> 21:27.703
It's just so hard.

21:27.786 --> 21:28.704
Yeah.

21:32.416 --> 21:33.292
Hugh.

21:33.959 --> 21:34.835
Janet.

21:42.676 --> 21:44.177
I'm sorry we're here.

21:46.054 --> 21:47.597
I'm so sorry.

21:48.807 --> 21:49.683
I mean...

21:50.267 --> 21:52.352
None of us should be here.

21:52.436 --> 21:53.812
I know what you mean.

21:56.398 --> 21:57.316
Well.

22:17.586 --> 22:20.047
We're going to make a tent
over this whole area

22:20.130 --> 22:21.798
and then we'll bring the fans in.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.054
Do you hear that?

22:27.971 --> 22:28.805
Yeah.

22:43.737 --> 22:46.573
That mold guy telling me
there's no rats down here.

22:46.698 --> 22:48.325
-What a pro, huh?

22:48.784 --> 22:51.161
I'll add some strychnine
to the shopping list.

22:51.620 --> 22:52.621
Strychnine?

22:53.288 --> 22:54.414
It's rat poison.

22:54.873 --> 22:56.208
Huh, look at this.

22:56.750 --> 22:58.710
Crain men, hard at work.

22:59.169 --> 23:00.420
I have a present for you.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.924
-Master blueprints?
-Master blueprints.

23:04.007 --> 23:05.008
Was I right?

23:05.884 --> 23:08.220
You see, Steve, your dad thinks
that all this water

23:08.303 --> 23:10.347
is coming from that red room upstairs.

23:12.099 --> 23:13.475
So, what's next?

23:14.142 --> 23:16.645
Hanging plastic
and then we ventilate it.

23:17.229 --> 23:19.064
Ventilate it

23:19.147 --> 23:20.524
Be safe down here.

23:21.817 --> 23:22.818
Good job, honey.

23:37.040 --> 23:40.335
"Away" by James Whitcomb Riley.

23:41.962 --> 23:45.841
I cannot say and I will not say
that she is dead

23:48.051 --> 23:49.177
She's just away

23:51.304 --> 23:52.639
With a cheery smile

23:53.598 --> 23:55.058
And a wave of the hand

23:55.559 --> 23:57.853
She has wandered into an unknown land

23:59.146 --> 24:02.732
And left us dreaming,
how very fair it needs must be

24:02.816 --> 24:04.359
Since she lingers there

24:05.402 --> 24:07.529
And you, o' you

24:07.696 --> 24:10.824
Who the wildest yearn
for the old-time step

24:11.491 --> 24:12.909
And the glad return

24:13.535 --> 24:15.078
Think of her fairing on

24:15.871 --> 24:18.832
As dear in the love of There
as the love of Here

24:25.005 --> 24:26.006
She's not dead

24:26.631 --> 24:27.924
She's just away

24:34.181 --> 24:36.057
If anyone wants to say a few words...

24:49.237 --> 24:50.071
Mmm.

24:56.661 --> 24:57.579
I, um...

24:59.080 --> 25:01.124
I was born 90 seconds before Nell.

25:02.375 --> 25:03.293
And, uh...

25:04.961 --> 25:06.546
I'd use that to,

25:07.380 --> 25:09.382
you know, if we had a fight, or, um...

25:11.092 --> 25:15.055
if I wanted something,
I'd say I was the oldest, so...

25:15.889 --> 25:17.307
she had to do what I said.

25:18.934 --> 25:20.519
And...

25:21.353 --> 25:23.438
And she let me get away with it.

25:24.689 --> 25:26.900
I mean, even though
she knew it was bullshit.

25:31.821 --> 25:34.115
The last time I saw her, she, um...

25:39.621 --> 25:41.206
she was driving me to rehab.

25:42.874 --> 25:45.168
So she... she dropped me off.

25:46.878 --> 25:47.963
And she...

25:50.090 --> 25:51.758
she looked at me and she said,

25:53.301 --> 25:56.555
"You go in there
and you bring my brother back."

25:59.182 --> 26:01.685
"Bring my brother back."

26:03.228 --> 26:04.312
Attagirl.

26:05.689 --> 26:07.649
I was born 90 seconds before Nell...

26:09.359 --> 26:11.403
but she was always my big sister.

26:30.880 --> 26:33.967
If you could take another look
for a key to that red room upstairs,

26:34.050 --> 26:35.218
I could really use it.

26:36.386 --> 26:39.222
I've ruled out just about everything else
as a water source.

26:39.306 --> 26:43.018
Don't know what could be in there
losing this much water, but I gotta look.

26:45.604 --> 26:46.438
What's this?

26:47.188 --> 26:48.356
Oh, it's the, uh...

26:50.984 --> 26:52.193
I don't know exactly.

26:54.487 --> 26:55.614
The missus do these?

26:56.197 --> 26:57.032
Yeah.

26:59.326 --> 27:00.160
I'm sure it's...

27:01.286 --> 27:03.038
No, I'm not, I got to ask her.

27:09.878 --> 27:10.962
You know, um...

27:12.505 --> 27:14.049
it probably ain't my place...

27:16.259 --> 27:19.137
but maybe she could use a little time
away from the house.

27:19.721 --> 27:21.056
Time away from the house?

27:21.723 --> 27:22.557
Yeah.

27:23.975 --> 27:25.477
I think you might be right.

27:26.853 --> 27:28.521
It's probably not your place.

27:36.488 --> 27:38.740
You know, my mother
worked in this house.

27:40.367 --> 27:41.743
She was kitchen staff.

27:43.411 --> 27:44.871
I was actually born here.

27:45.997 --> 27:46.998
Oh, is that right?

27:47.374 --> 27:48.333
Yeah.

27:48.416 --> 27:52.295
When I was young they moved us out to
the cottage at the edge of the property.

27:53.505 --> 27:54.714
That's where I grew up.

27:55.840 --> 27:58.885
We ended up buying it from Miss Hill
and we're still there.

28:01.846 --> 28:02.889
But my mom,

28:04.099 --> 28:05.975
she... she never liked Hill House.

28:08.186 --> 28:10.814
She'd come home sometimes

28:10.897 --> 28:12.065
after a long shift

28:12.774 --> 28:13.942
or a night shift,

28:15.151 --> 28:16.069
and she'd be...

28:18.238 --> 28:20.407
scattered, you might say.

28:22.033 --> 28:22.992
Scattered?

28:23.702 --> 28:25.787
Talk to herself and the like.

28:28.164 --> 28:31.751
Towards the end, she'd wander
into the woods at night barefoot.

28:32.877 --> 28:35.422
And I swear I could hear her out there,

28:36.297 --> 28:38.842
giggling like a schoolgirl in love,

28:39.759 --> 28:41.219
out there in the cold,

28:41.886 --> 28:44.764
talking low, like to a suitor.

28:47.892 --> 28:50.562
And she'd sleep out there
sometimes, too, so yeah,

28:51.354 --> 28:52.313
scattered.

28:54.649 --> 28:55.567
I see.

28:56.484 --> 28:58.236
So Mom died and, um...

29:00.071 --> 29:03.950
I met Clara when she got hired on
working for Miss Hill.

29:06.369 --> 29:08.496
We even got married on the grounds.

29:09.914 --> 29:10.874
But, uh...

29:11.291 --> 29:13.668
Clara, she spent a lot of time in here.

29:14.753 --> 29:17.046
Especially when Hazel got sick.

29:17.505 --> 29:18.923
I mean, double shifts.

29:19.549 --> 29:21.342
Even, even longer sometimes.

29:24.387 --> 29:25.221
Well,

29:25.680 --> 29:26.848
Clara got pregnant.

29:28.016 --> 29:30.143
Our first real blessing.

29:32.437 --> 29:33.438
But, uh...

29:35.356 --> 29:37.275
Miss Hill made her keep on working,

29:37.609 --> 29:38.985
even with the baby coming.

29:40.945 --> 29:42.781
You know, and Clara didn't complain,

29:43.406 --> 29:45.408
'cause she's a strong woman.

29:47.076 --> 29:48.536
She's a towering woman.

29:51.498 --> 29:53.750
And so she did it.
She didn't take any time.

29:54.876 --> 29:55.710
And, uh...

29:56.586 --> 29:58.922
So the day comes,
the doc comes, and...

30:00.673 --> 30:02.133
my little girl's stillborn.

30:03.551 --> 30:05.011
Oh, I'm so sorry.

30:06.805 --> 30:09.182
It was a dark time, my first one, and...

30:11.684 --> 30:13.144
she never even got to...

30:17.065 --> 30:18.191
Anyway, we, uh...

30:19.192 --> 30:21.653
we offered it up,
put it in God's hands, and...

30:23.905 --> 30:25.782
She went back to work fast.

30:25.865 --> 30:26.825
I mean, she's...

30:27.992 --> 30:29.828
never been one to dwell, but...

30:30.870 --> 30:34.249
Grace of God, she was back to it,
not a month later.

30:36.125 --> 30:38.044
But the nightmares she had.

30:39.170 --> 30:41.464
I mean, Clara is a brave woman,

30:42.006 --> 30:43.341
and these nightmares,

30:43.424 --> 30:45.134
they had her down in a corner,

30:45.426 --> 30:48.179
shaking so bad I thought
she'd seize up dead.

30:48.721 --> 30:49.931
God, I'm sorry.

30:51.099 --> 30:52.016
So one night,

30:53.059 --> 30:55.103
she's cleaning the master bedroom
up there.

30:55.186 --> 30:58.314
This is before Hazel passed.
She's cleaning Hazel's room.

30:58.982 --> 30:59.899
And, uh...

31:02.193 --> 31:04.654
she hears a... a baby crying.

31:05.780 --> 31:07.282
Hears it in other rooms, too.

31:07.782 --> 31:10.451
And she goes looking and looking.

31:11.995 --> 31:14.706
And I mean, I thought she was losing
her damn mind.

31:16.499 --> 31:18.042
But it rattled her so good,

31:18.543 --> 31:20.044
she ran home.

31:20.670 --> 31:22.630
Through the woods, no light.

31:23.047 --> 31:26.134
Scratched her face to ribbons
on the branches.

31:32.181 --> 31:34.559
So I came back here with her one night
and...

31:38.438 --> 31:41.024
I'll be damned, but I heard it, too,
and I...

31:43.318 --> 31:45.236
I... I knew it.

31:45.653 --> 31:46.946
I don't know how,

31:48.406 --> 31:50.074
but sure as St. Thomas,

31:50.158 --> 31:52.744
my doubts, they just dropped away.

31:53.828 --> 31:55.121
And I knew.

31:55.788 --> 31:57.582
That was my first

31:57.874 --> 31:59.626
little girl's cry.

32:00.168 --> 32:02.128
That-- That first cry,

32:02.211 --> 32:03.755
the one she never got to...

32:09.594 --> 32:10.428
So...

32:11.512 --> 32:13.389
we stopped coming here after dark.

32:14.474 --> 32:16.559
Told Miss Hill, you can fire us,

32:17.268 --> 32:19.687
but once dinner's served, we leave,

32:19.771 --> 32:21.773
come back in the morning
for the dishes.

32:22.774 --> 32:25.652
Never spend a minute inside after dark.

32:27.403 --> 32:29.530
Ah, just superstitious at first.

32:30.990 --> 32:32.075
But here's the thing.

32:32.951 --> 32:33.993
It worked.

32:35.286 --> 32:36.621
No more nightmares,

32:37.288 --> 32:38.539
no more crying,

32:38.998 --> 32:40.750
no one acting scattered.

32:42.001 --> 32:44.462
We stuck to it and it's better.

32:45.254 --> 32:46.255
So...

32:47.382 --> 32:48.216
yeah,

32:48.466 --> 32:49.884
it's not my place.

32:51.886 --> 32:55.056
But if you find your missus
is acting scattered...

32:56.683 --> 33:00.103
then, yeah, maybe a little time away

33:00.478 --> 33:01.646
would do the trick.

33:02.480 --> 33:04.023
From the house, I mean.

33:06.192 --> 33:07.568
And a little prayer, too.

33:08.194 --> 33:09.153
Most likely.

33:10.655 --> 33:12.949
Well, prayer's not really
our thing, but...

33:15.284 --> 33:16.327
I take your point.

33:17.787 --> 33:19.247
Each their own, I suppose.

34:05.585 --> 34:07.045
You guys hop in here.

34:11.507 --> 34:12.842
All right, get in.

34:19.682 --> 34:20.558
Ride with us.

34:21.267 --> 34:22.977
-I'll meet you there.
-Shirl.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.033
Coming with us?

34:40.870 --> 34:41.996
I'll meet you there.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.749
-There's plenty of space.
-I gotta do a few things.

34:44.832 --> 34:46.084
I'll meet you there.

34:46.167 --> 34:47.418
Jesus, Shirl.

34:47.794 --> 34:48.628
Today?

34:50.171 --> 34:51.297
Even today?

34:51.380 --> 34:53.216
Not everything's about you, Steve.

35:03.142 --> 35:04.143
Shit.

35:05.186 --> 35:06.104
Need a ride?

35:09.649 --> 35:10.650
Beautiful service.

35:13.319 --> 35:14.195
Mmm.

35:15.738 --> 35:17.240
Who knew Luke had it in him.

35:17.949 --> 35:18.825
Don't.

35:28.167 --> 35:30.920
You know, I was talking to Theo
this morning.

35:31.879 --> 35:33.005
That so?

35:33.089 --> 35:33.923
And...

35:34.841 --> 35:37.802
after listening to what you said today

35:38.219 --> 35:40.304
about Nellie,
and what your brother said...

35:40.388 --> 35:41.389
Don't.

35:41.472 --> 35:43.474
You have problems, we all do,

35:43.558 --> 35:46.310
but if there's one thing we can
take away from today,

35:46.686 --> 35:49.772
it's that in the end,
all you guys have is each other.

35:49.856 --> 35:51.649
Did Theo tell you what she did?

35:52.567 --> 35:53.484
Uh, no.

35:54.485 --> 35:55.486
Don't.

35:59.574 --> 36:02.869
But you know, we all fuck up
and we can be upset with each other,

36:02.952 --> 36:06.247
but one day,
we'll wake up and it'll be too late--

36:06.330 --> 36:08.249
Stay the fuck out of my business.

36:09.792 --> 36:10.793
There it is.

36:11.794 --> 36:12.837
Stuck your hand...

36:12.920 --> 36:14.130
Right in the fan.

36:18.593 --> 36:19.802
Fucking fan.

36:21.804 --> 36:23.055
You see, Steve?

36:23.973 --> 36:26.017
I didn't let them mold guy
do the whole job,

36:26.100 --> 36:27.852
so he gave me some busted fans.

36:28.769 --> 36:31.772
This one's totally screwed.
I'm going to have to open it up.

36:34.066 --> 36:35.985
Steve, can you unplug it over there?

36:38.279 --> 36:41.157
And hand me that hex wrench,
it should be in that box.

36:57.590 --> 36:59.759
Ah! Jesus Christ!

37:01.385 --> 37:02.929
-Fuck!
-Dad?

37:07.183 --> 37:10.186
-I told you to unplug the--
-I did!

37:10.269 --> 37:12.438
-I unplugged it! I did it!
-Fuck!

37:12.521 --> 37:14.106
It's okay. It's okay.

37:14.190 --> 37:15.858
-I unplugged it.
-It's okay.

37:15.942 --> 37:17.235
It was an accident.

37:17.652 --> 37:18.486
Fuck!

37:21.072 --> 37:21.906
Okay.

37:22.990 --> 37:23.950
Listen, pal.

37:24.075 --> 37:27.370
Why don't you go upstairs and play?
I think I got this covered now.

37:27.453 --> 37:28.663
I want to help.

37:29.497 --> 37:31.749
It's okay. You've helped.

37:36.170 --> 37:37.338
All right, you fucker.

37:56.983 --> 37:57.817
Fuck.

37:58.442 --> 38:00.653
Fuck... you.

38:08.536 --> 38:09.412
Fuck!

38:12.164 --> 38:13.249
Ah!

38:22.300 --> 38:23.134
Fuck you!

39:04.508 --> 39:07.887
My little girl. No.

39:09.013 --> 39:10.139
She did raise her.

39:10.222 --> 39:11.974
Still.

39:16.270 --> 39:17.646
Come on. Get up.

39:33.746 --> 39:35.039
I'm so sorry.

39:38.626 --> 39:40.086
I'm so sorry, Nellie.

39:51.514 --> 39:52.473
Don't.

39:55.893 --> 39:56.977
Stay.

39:57.353 --> 39:58.312
Please.

39:58.979 --> 39:59.897
Stay.

40:01.941 --> 40:02.858
Luke!

40:05.903 --> 40:07.154
Did you--?

40:07.363 --> 40:09.240
Did-- Did you see her?

40:10.116 --> 40:11.033
No.

40:11.742 --> 40:13.702
It was-- It was Mom.
It was Mom and Nellie.

40:13.953 --> 40:14.829
Stop it.

40:15.913 --> 40:17.915
-I saw them.
-No, you didn't. Look at me.

40:19.250 --> 40:20.876
You didn't because they're dead.

40:22.628 --> 40:25.798
People see things, Luke.
I know all about it. I write about it.

40:27.091 --> 40:30.136
Hell, I've seen things this week,
but it's not real, it's not.

40:30.636 --> 40:32.096
-They--
-If you don't get that,

40:32.179 --> 40:34.014
if you don't get your shit together,

40:34.098 --> 40:36.976
like Mom and Nell didn't
get their shit together,

40:37.059 --> 40:39.311
you'll end up just like them,
you understand?

40:40.396 --> 40:41.856
Because it's in our genes.

40:43.274 --> 40:45.276
It's-- It's a sickness.

40:47.069 --> 40:48.612
So you've got to be vigilant.

40:49.155 --> 40:50.239
Get it together.

40:50.656 --> 40:52.908
And stop talking like
a fucking crazy person.

40:53.284 --> 40:55.494
I don't want to bury you, too,
you understand?

40:55.578 --> 40:56.871
-Okay?
-Okay.

40:58.831 --> 41:00.082
We're almost through it.

41:01.083 --> 41:02.334
You're almost through it.

41:02.460 --> 41:03.544
Gonna be okay?

41:06.172 --> 41:07.715
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

41:34.074 --> 41:34.909
Liv?

41:46.712 --> 41:47.671
Liv?

41:56.889 --> 41:57.890
Liv!

42:01.435 --> 42:02.353
Hugh?

42:04.146 --> 42:04.980
Hugh?

42:09.443 --> 42:10.277
Oh.

42:11.946 --> 42:14.114
Liv, what the fuck?

42:14.990 --> 42:16.242
I'm sorry, I was...

42:16.951 --> 42:20.037
I was-- I was having a horrible dream.

42:20.120 --> 42:21.038
You think?

42:21.372 --> 42:23.290
I'm sorry. I'm-- I'm so sorry.

42:23.374 --> 42:25.543
-I don't even know--
-What's going on with you?

42:26.001 --> 42:26.835
Nothing.

42:26.919 --> 42:29.255
You're holding a fucking screwdriver
to my throat.

42:29.338 --> 42:30.631
No, I wasn't.

42:31.215 --> 42:32.383
We need to talk.

42:33.175 --> 42:34.760
We got to do-- You're not...

42:35.302 --> 42:38.389
I don't know what we have to do,
but we have to do something. You're...

42:38.472 --> 42:39.473
What?

42:40.641 --> 42:41.642
I'm what?

42:48.399 --> 42:49.567
Uh, I don't...

42:50.317 --> 42:51.277
What is this?

42:51.527 --> 42:53.362
It's the master blueprint you drew.

42:54.822 --> 42:56.198
No, it's not.

42:56.657 --> 42:57.616
Yes, it is.

42:58.784 --> 43:00.536
I didn't know what this was.

43:05.124 --> 43:06.292
It looked familiar.

43:12.381 --> 43:14.717
You used the same shape dozens of times.

43:17.928 --> 43:18.929
Over and over.

43:24.685 --> 43:26.437
It's the footprint to our house.

43:27.396 --> 43:29.773
To our forever house. You just...

43:30.983 --> 43:33.235
You drew it again and again.

43:33.319 --> 43:34.862
But I-- I didn't.

43:34.945 --> 43:36.322
-You did.
-I didn't.

43:42.161 --> 43:42.995
That's...

43:43.787 --> 43:44.663
absurd.

43:47.791 --> 43:49.293
Maybe you should take a break.

43:51.295 --> 43:52.504
Take a little rest.

43:54.923 --> 43:55.799
I could...

43:57.051 --> 43:59.845
I guess I could see
if Janet's up for a visit.

44:01.764 --> 44:03.599
Just for a couple days or something.

44:03.682 --> 44:05.017
That could be good.

44:05.267 --> 44:07.019
-Just a few.
-But how?

44:08.479 --> 44:11.190
You'd have to juggle the kids
and the house and--

44:11.273 --> 44:12.149
I'll manage.

44:15.235 --> 44:17.821
-I just want you to be--
-Not crazy?

44:18.739 --> 44:19.865
I didn't say that.

44:25.871 --> 44:29.291
I just think I've underestimated
these migraines, you know?

44:30.209 --> 44:32.294
I'm not sleeping
through the night at all.

44:33.879 --> 44:35.422
These constant dreams.

44:35.881 --> 44:36.715
I know.

44:37.800 --> 44:38.842
You're just tired.

44:40.302 --> 44:43.097
It just snuck up on me all of a sudden.

44:43.639 --> 44:45.057
But, um...

44:47.351 --> 44:48.310
I'll sort it out.

44:52.147 --> 44:53.107
I promise.

45:33.313 --> 45:34.398
Almost over.

45:35.941 --> 45:36.817
You did good.

45:37.985 --> 45:38.986
Finish your drink.

45:40.028 --> 45:41.363
Say your goodbyes.

45:42.531 --> 45:45.951
Probably won't have to see them
again for years if you don't want to.

45:51.206 --> 45:53.500
But you do want to, don't you?

46:08.390 --> 46:09.224
Hey.

46:09.516 --> 46:10.517
Mm-hmm.

46:12.352 --> 46:13.437
How you holding up?

46:14.146 --> 46:16.440
You know, I'm-- Yeah, I'm okay.

46:16.523 --> 46:17.357
Hmm.

46:18.192 --> 46:19.151
I, um...

46:22.988 --> 46:24.156
I overheard

46:24.782 --> 46:27.284
you and Steve talking earlier
at the grave.

46:27.367 --> 46:29.161
You know...

46:29.953 --> 46:32.790
-Well, that was embarrassing.
-No.

46:33.999 --> 46:34.875
You know,

46:36.376 --> 46:38.921
I see your mother every day.

46:39.880 --> 46:41.799
I do. I have since she died.

46:41.882 --> 46:43.759
Well, that's pretty nuts.

46:43.842 --> 46:46.053
Well, it's-- For me
it's a coping mechanism,

46:46.136 --> 46:49.014
and you'd be surprised,
a lot of widowers, widows,

46:49.097 --> 46:52.935
who... they do that, they recreate
loved ones in their mind, and...

46:53.852 --> 46:55.187
Nothing to be embarrassed about.

46:55.270 --> 46:57.898
In fact, my therapist says
that it's a perfectly normal--

46:57.981 --> 46:59.733
Well, I'm happy for you, Dad.

47:00.901 --> 47:01.735
But...

47:02.986 --> 47:04.988
it doesn't mean it's always the case.

47:06.490 --> 47:07.366
Okay?

47:08.575 --> 47:09.952
Because people see things.

47:11.119 --> 47:15.165
And it's-- I know it sounds nuts,
but it's, uh--

47:15.249 --> 47:17.543
But you don't have to feel crazy,
because sometimes--

47:17.626 --> 47:21.129
Big boys know the difference
between what's real and imaginary.

47:22.256 --> 47:23.423
Isn't that right, Dad?

47:26.510 --> 47:27.386
Hmm.

47:28.303 --> 47:29.555
I, uh, listen...

47:35.310 --> 47:36.144
I'm...

47:36.937 --> 47:38.230
just so proud of you.

47:39.273 --> 47:40.774
And you're doing so well.

47:42.693 --> 47:44.778
Hey, keep it up.

47:45.153 --> 47:46.613
Okay? Just keep it up.

47:51.702 --> 47:53.203
I'm glad you're here, Dad.

48:52.471 --> 48:54.139
You little shits.

48:54.848 --> 48:56.433
You little shits are dead.

48:58.852 --> 48:59.978
So dead.

50:03.417 --> 50:04.459
Good Lord.

50:05.252 --> 50:07.087
I'm going to keep children upstairs.

50:08.046 --> 50:09.673
Make sure they don't see this.

50:21.601 --> 50:25.188
Well, Mr. Crain, I think you
just solved one of our oldest cold cases.

50:25.564 --> 50:26.898
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

50:27.858 --> 50:30.193
William Hill, been missing since '48.

50:31.069 --> 50:32.946
Case went cold with the department.

50:34.281 --> 50:36.992
Widow had PIs looking for him
for years after.

50:37.659 --> 50:39.995
I'll be damned he was here all along.

50:41.079 --> 50:43.540
How did he--

50:43.623 --> 50:46.835
It looks like he bricked himself in.
The tools were in there with him.

50:47.002 --> 50:48.837
And man, the scratches...

50:50.005 --> 50:51.840
I guess he had second thoughts.

50:52.799 --> 50:53.717
Yeah, he was...

50:54.051 --> 50:56.136
He was trying to scratch his way out?

50:56.219 --> 50:59.681
Well, good news is, Massachusetts
doesn't require that you disclose

50:59.765 --> 51:02.434
you've had any death on the premises
to any potential buyers.

51:05.437 --> 51:06.313
Oh...

51:08.065 --> 51:09.524
You folks have a good night now.

51:17.032 --> 51:18.408
You know, I got to ask.

51:19.159 --> 51:21.286
You know, folks around town talk,

51:21.369 --> 51:23.371
they've always talked about this place.

51:25.165 --> 51:25.999
Is it?

51:27.084 --> 51:28.043
What?

51:28.710 --> 51:29.669
Haunted.

51:30.337 --> 51:31.463
Oh!

51:32.881 --> 51:34.716
You know, yeah.

51:35.634 --> 51:37.844
At least, a few my kids sure think so.

51:43.100 --> 51:43.934
Yeah.

51:45.227 --> 51:46.520
Sure nice meeting you.

51:47.145 --> 51:48.396
-You, too.
-Mm-hmm.

52:19.094 --> 52:20.846
Well.

52:22.097 --> 52:23.265
That was a day.

52:23.890 --> 52:24.766
It was.

52:26.685 --> 52:29.354
Um, listen, I'm flying out
early in the morning,

52:29.437 --> 52:30.814
so I probably won't see you.

52:30.897 --> 52:32.816
-All set with your flight?
-Yeah.

52:32.899 --> 52:33.733
I'll, um...

52:35.402 --> 52:39.322
I'll be around at the hotel later
if you want to get a drink or--

52:39.406 --> 52:41.783
-Well, I'm an early flight, too.
-Yeah, right.

52:42.993 --> 52:43.994
Gotcha.

52:44.077 --> 52:44.953
Listen, uh...

52:47.539 --> 52:48.373
Steve...

52:50.041 --> 52:50.876
What?

52:54.337 --> 52:57.674
I'm sorry I didn't talk,
and I'm sorry I didn't listen.

52:58.466 --> 53:00.135
And I'm sorry I wasn't there.

53:01.219 --> 53:02.929
And it's the regret of my life.

53:04.222 --> 53:05.640
I'm so, so sorry

53:06.766 --> 53:08.018
that I couldn't fix it.

53:09.769 --> 53:10.729
What?

53:14.232 --> 53:15.317
You fly safe.

53:15.692 --> 53:16.651
You, too.

53:18.069 --> 53:18.904
Shit.

53:20.697 --> 53:21.531
You okay?

53:21.615 --> 53:23.033
Yeah, I can't...

53:23.575 --> 53:27.370
I can't find my credit card
and the caterer's got to be paid.

53:28.288 --> 53:29.331
Did you tow my car?

53:30.332 --> 53:32.167
Reception's over, Theodora.

53:32.250 --> 53:35.045
-As far as you're concerned, we're closed.
-Sorry.

53:35.128 --> 53:36.296
My car is gone.

53:36.588 --> 53:37.756
What do you mean?

53:37.839 --> 53:39.966
-I mean, my car is gone.
-It's gone?

53:40.050 --> 53:42.344
It was outside my house like always
and now it's gone.

53:42.427 --> 53:45.347
-You probably parked it somewhere else.
-I know where I parked my car.

53:45.430 --> 53:48.558
-My wallet's not in here. It was in here.
-You saw him.

53:48.850 --> 53:52.145
Where the hell is it

53:52.229 --> 53:53.939
You saw him
but didn't wanna believe it.

53:54.022 --> 53:54.856
Shirley, uh--

53:54.940 --> 53:56.441
I'm sure it's around.

53:56.858 --> 53:58.568
-Kevin's by the kitchen.
-Guys--

53:58.652 --> 54:00.487
You want my card?
I can pay for it.

54:00.570 --> 54:02.906
That's not the point.
It was right here.

54:02.989 --> 54:04.407
You knew it looked wrong.

54:05.033 --> 54:06.534
He looked wrong.

54:06.868 --> 54:08.370
Has anybody seen Luke?

54:14.084 --> 54:14.918
Oh, no.

54:15.001 --> 54:16.836
Your silence doesn't protect them.

54:18.088 --> 54:19.047
Yes.

54:20.924 --> 54:21.758
Yes.

54:23.969 --> 54:24.886
He was...

54:26.179 --> 54:27.097
right there.

54:28.139 --> 54:29.432
He was looking at your...

54:30.600 --> 54:31.601
And then he...

54:32.102 --> 54:35.522
he wanted to have a smoke,
he went outside about an hour ago.

54:36.147 --> 54:37.482
Well, did he come back?

54:37.565 --> 54:39.734
I don't know. I... don't know.

54:39.818 --> 54:40.944
Fucking hell!

54:41.319 --> 54:44.155
-He can't even last one day?
-An hour.

54:44.698 --> 54:46.700
He probably already has
a needle in his arm.

54:46.783 --> 54:47.909
We don't know that.

54:49.119 --> 54:50.537
I'll check outside.

54:54.874 --> 54:55.750
What's that?

55:31.202 --> 55:32.329
Oh, God.

55:33.288 --> 55:34.122
Oh.

55:34.247 --> 55:36.249
Oh, no, she's gonna kill someone.

55:36.333 --> 55:38.626
That's-- It's okay. I can...

55:39.044 --> 55:40.128
-I--

56:03.276 --> 56:05.779
Make it stop! Make it stop!

56:14.454 --> 56:15.955
What was that screaming?

56:19.918 --> 56:20.919
Oh, God.

56:23.046 --> 56:24.089
No.

56:31.805 --> 56:33.056
Who did this?

56:35.517 --> 56:36.684
It wasn't...

56:37.268 --> 56:38.228
It was...

56:39.270 --> 56:41.272
It was like this when... when we--

56:41.356 --> 56:43.066
I can-- I can fix it.

56:43.691 --> 56:46.111
I can-- I can fix it.
I can fix it. Yeah.

56:47.195 --> 56:48.780
You're not fixing this.

56:49.489 --> 56:52.033
I'm giving you every opportunity
and you...

56:54.411 --> 56:56.788
-Don't know why you won't help me.
-I'm helping you.

56:56.871 --> 56:58.623
You keep saying that you didn't hurt her,

56:58.706 --> 57:00.708
but you get real upset
if I say she killed herself.

57:00.792 --> 57:01.918
I'm very tired.

57:02.001 --> 57:05.547
And twice, twice now, you say
that the house killed her.

57:05.964 --> 57:06.923
I know what I said.

57:07.048 --> 57:09.300
So you're either in denial
of your wife committing suicide,

57:09.384 --> 57:11.678
-or you're in denial of something worse.
-I didn't touch her.

57:11.761 --> 57:14.139
I don't know why you won't
give me these three hours.

57:14.222 --> 57:16.141
These three hours would help you so much,

57:16.224 --> 57:17.934
and you won't do it. I don't get it.

57:18.017 --> 57:19.060
I told you.

57:19.144 --> 57:20.645
The three hours you waited,

57:20.728 --> 57:23.064
after you discovered her body,
before you called us,

57:23.148 --> 57:25.400
what happened in those three hours, Hugh?

57:26.192 --> 57:27.444
I was in shock.

57:28.069 --> 57:29.070
I was mourning.

57:29.988 --> 57:33.783
You didn't call us for three hours
because you were grieving?

57:33.867 --> 57:34.784
That's right.

57:36.453 --> 57:38.163
First you say
your wife went out of town.

57:38.246 --> 57:40.832
-I thought she did.
-Uh-huh. To be with her sister.

57:41.207 --> 57:43.751
-But we talked to Janet and she never--
-I know.

57:44.669 --> 57:46.546
-Anything you want to add to that?
-Not really.

57:46.629 --> 57:49.132
I thought she went out of town.
She hadn't, that's all.

57:49.716 --> 57:51.134
I must have misunderstood.

57:51.217 --> 57:52.844
Your daughter Shirley says
she woke you up

57:52.927 --> 57:54.888
'cause she was surprised
to see Mom in the kitchen.

57:54.971 --> 57:55.805
That's right.

57:55.889 --> 57:58.349
Then she says that you ran up the stairs
to the...

57:59.559 --> 58:00.727
the Red Room.

58:04.772 --> 58:05.815
So what did you see?

58:06.983 --> 58:08.568
When you got to the Red Room?

58:10.904 --> 58:11.905
Nothing.

58:12.322 --> 58:14.824
That door's been locked
since we moved in, so...

58:16.284 --> 58:17.285
it was nothing.

58:19.287 --> 58:20.246
Nothing.
