00:27.394 --> 00:29.361
Wake up, Victor.

00:31.698 --> 00:35.067
No sleeping
your last day on the job.

00:36.070 --> 00:38.237
36 more hours,

00:38.239 --> 00:40.105
and I'll be on
my second honeymoon.

00:40.107 --> 00:42.041
Venice,
here I come,

00:42.043 --> 00:43.709
and I can't wait.

00:43.711 --> 00:46.812
No more scrubbing
frozen snot off my face.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.781
No more cataloguing
useless cryoseism

00:48.783 --> 00:50.182
for credits,

00:50.184 --> 00:52.184
and no more
spooning with Brad

00:52.186 --> 00:53.619
to stay warm
at night.

00:53.621 --> 00:54.753
You love it.

00:54.755 --> 00:56.789
Come on,
admit it, Victor,

00:56.791 --> 00:59.058
you'll miss us
when you're gone.

00:59.060 --> 01:00.726
This calls...

01:00.728 --> 01:04.596
For a going-away toast.

01:04.598 --> 01:06.498
I won't say no.

01:10.570 --> 01:13.472
Hey, Brad, you might
want to look at that.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.618
Winds are blowing hard
from the north,

01:26.620 --> 01:27.686
but other than that,

01:27.688 --> 01:28.754
nothing.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.556
Everything looks normal.

01:30.558 --> 01:31.623
Stay warm out there.

01:31.625 --> 01:32.624
Toodle-oo.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.259
Victor...

01:34.261 --> 01:36.295
I hope your wife gets
pregnant first try.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.282
Yeah...

01:57.284 --> 01:59.418
Voila.

02:06.759 --> 02:07.826
To Brad.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.228
To Brad.

02:30.451 --> 02:31.583
Uh-oh.

02:31.585 --> 02:33.652
Poor Brad.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.354
That's three
transmitters out.

02:35.356 --> 02:37.289
That is not
a good omen.

02:57.944 --> 02:59.378
Now what?

02:59.380 --> 03:00.412
What now?

03:02.549 --> 03:02.548
That can't be right.

03:02.550 --> 03:05.284
Have you ever seen the
temperature drop that fast?

03:09.522 --> 03:13.725
Victor, did you say
the wind was blowing north?

03:16.430 --> 03:18.197
Victor?

03:18.199 --> 03:19.264
This thing's not working.

03:20.334 --> 03:22.201
Brad, can you hear me?
Do you copy?

03:22.203 --> 03:23.569
Come back.

03:24.837 --> 03:26.205
Yeah, we need
to go after him.

03:26.207 --> 03:27.773
His lungs are
gonna freeze

03:27.775 --> 03:28.807
if he's out there
much longer.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.242
There's no time,
look at that.

03:30.244 --> 03:31.243
Brad, do you copy?

03:35.748 --> 03:37.282
Move!

03:38.484 --> 03:39.518
Brad!

03:41.888 --> 03:43.422
Brad!

03:48.628 --> 03:50.562
Run, Brad! Run! Run!

03:55.768 --> 03:57.002
Come on, Brad! Come on!

03:57.004 --> 03:58.570
That's it, come on!

03:58.572 --> 03:59.571
Get up!

04:00.574 --> 04:01.607
No!

04:03.243 --> 04:05.444
Close the door,
or we're both gonna die!

05:29.962 --> 05:32.331
This is it, family,

05:32.333 --> 05:33.732
my home away from home.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.834
Our home away from home.

05:35.836 --> 05:36.968
Our home
away from home,

05:36.970 --> 05:38.737
I stand corrected.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.005
So how long have we--
we've been coming here

05:40.007 --> 05:41.373
for over 20 years,
now, jordy.

05:41.375 --> 05:43.108
Since before
you were even born.

05:43.110 --> 05:45.043
It's Jordan, dad.

05:45.045 --> 05:46.678
You should know,
you named me.

05:47.914 --> 05:48.880
And by the looks
of this place,

05:48.882 --> 05:50.582
I guess I should
be glad

05:50.584 --> 05:51.717
that you've never
dragged me

05:51.719 --> 05:52.884
on one of your...

05:52.886 --> 05:53.919
Emergency trips.

05:53.921 --> 05:55.120
Oh, Jordan!

05:55.122 --> 05:55.120
You know what, babe,

05:55.122 --> 05:57.789
I didn't think our boy
had the stamina

05:57.791 --> 05:57.789
to be able to complain

05:57.791 --> 06:00.025
all the way from
south Florida to Alaska,

06:00.027 --> 06:01.093
but he's managed it.

06:01.095 --> 06:01.093
It's impressive.

06:01.095 --> 06:03.795
It is, even for
a teenager, it's amazing.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.097
You said I could
spend break in cabo

06:05.099 --> 06:06.498
with Rory.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.367
We said you
could go to cabo

06:08.369 --> 06:09.701
before that stunt
you pulled

06:09.703 --> 06:10.635
got you suspended.

06:10.637 --> 06:11.803
You don't get
to screw up

06:11.805 --> 06:12.838
and then go to cabo.

06:12.840 --> 06:13.805
It doesn't work
that way.

06:13.807 --> 06:14.973
You made your bed, pal.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.074
All right, first off,

06:16.076 --> 06:18.710
that so-called stunt
was hilarious.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.579
And Rory was just
as guilty as me,

06:20.581 --> 06:21.780
and where is he
right now?

06:21.782 --> 06:23.014
Cabo.

06:23.016 --> 06:24.583
Okay,
here's an idea,

06:24.585 --> 06:24.583
when we get back
to Florida,

06:24.585 --> 06:27.819
you can ask Rory's parents
to adopt you.

06:27.821 --> 06:28.854
I like that idea.

06:28.856 --> 06:28.854
Yeah? Yeah.
Problem solved.

06:28.856 --> 06:31.790
You are, you're
a problem-solver, babe.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.458
I gotta get outta here.

06:37.463 --> 06:40.799
Mr. and Mrs. summers!

06:40.801 --> 06:42.401
It's so good to see you.

06:42.403 --> 06:43.402
How was your drive?

06:43.404 --> 06:45.804
Long.

06:45.806 --> 06:47.806
I mean, we're used to
coming up here

06:47.808 --> 06:47.806
in the summertime,

06:47.808 --> 06:52.577
so the ice and snow is,
well, a bit much.

06:52.579 --> 06:52.577
I bet.

06:52.579 --> 06:55.147
It's not what you're used to
in Miami, is it?

06:55.149 --> 06:59.151
Wait, you guys
know each other?

06:59.153 --> 07:01.019
Yes, we do.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.754
Jordy,
this is Claire.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.623
Claire, this is
our son, jordy.

07:04.625 --> 07:05.791
Jordan.

07:05.793 --> 07:05.791
But... hi.

07:05.793 --> 07:08.093
Yeah, Claire's
grandparents

07:08.095 --> 07:09.494
built the b&b.

07:09.496 --> 07:10.896
Oh, they make
you work here?

07:10.898 --> 07:12.497
That sucks.

07:12.499 --> 07:13.865
Oh, no, they don't make me.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.967
Uh, I like working here.

07:15.969 --> 07:17.068
Apparently,
it's in my blood.

07:17.070 --> 07:18.570
Are your parents
here, Claire?

07:18.572 --> 07:20.605
'Cause we'd love to take
them out for dinner.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.073
No, they're
in new Mexico

07:22.075 --> 07:22.073
at a hotel
and b&b conference.

07:22.075 --> 07:25.877
We were actually going to
close the place up this week

07:25.879 --> 07:26.912
till they got
your call.

07:26.914 --> 07:29.448
Do you have wifi?

07:29.450 --> 07:31.116
Um, say, we, uh...

07:31.118 --> 07:32.784
Well, I gotta work
in the morning,

07:32.786 --> 07:35.187
and Candace is volunteering
at the clinic.

07:35.189 --> 07:35.187
I wonder,
if you wouldn't mind,

07:35.189 --> 07:37.122
perhaps you can
show this guy around

07:37.124 --> 07:38.123
a little bit.

07:38.125 --> 07:38.123
Dad!

07:38.125 --> 07:41.126
Uh... I'd love to give him
a tour, Mr. summers.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.895
Um, how about...

07:43.897 --> 07:46.465
Tomorrow at 9:00?

07:46.467 --> 07:48.900
I live downstairs,

07:48.902 --> 07:48.900
so it's easy.

07:48.902 --> 07:51.503
Okay, well,
that's settled.

07:51.505 --> 07:54.005
I'm going to
head upstairs

07:54.007 --> 07:55.474
and, uh, unwind.

07:55.476 --> 07:56.508
I'm just
going to grab

07:56.510 --> 07:56.508
a few more things
from the truck.

07:56.510 --> 07:56.508
-See you later.
-Yeah, see you later.

07:56.510 --> 08:00.145
-Want to fire these upstairs?
-Yeah, sure.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.079
Don't forget that, too.

08:04.851 --> 08:04.850
Are you gonna--

08:04.852 --> 08:08.086
uh, yeah,
I'll see you tomorrow.

08:08.088 --> 08:09.821
Yeah. See you tomorrow.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.641
Wow.

08:29.643 --> 08:32.143
Up before noon on a weekend?

08:32.145 --> 08:33.912
I'm shocked.

08:33.914 --> 08:36.181
Jordan summers, what have you
done with my real son?

08:36.183 --> 08:38.116
Very funny.

08:39.919 --> 08:42.687
Now I remember.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.056
Claire said
to meet you here at 9:00.

08:45.058 --> 08:47.526
Why is it you're never punctual
when I need you to be?

08:47.528 --> 08:49.027
Don't answer that.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.695
Speaking about being on time,

08:50.697 --> 08:52.731
we are meeting your dad
for dinner tonight,

08:52.733 --> 08:54.666
so, meet me at the clinic
at 5:30.

08:54.668 --> 08:56.768
We'll walk over
together, okay?

08:56.770 --> 08:58.770
Claire can tell you
how to get there.

08:59.805 --> 09:00.839
Yup.

09:00.841 --> 09:03.241
Seriously, jordy.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.710
You are on your last leg here.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.078
It took a lot of convincing
on our part

09:07.080 --> 09:09.047
to keep you from getting
kicked out of school.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.215
So?

09:10.217 --> 09:11.550
That school sucks.

09:11.552 --> 09:12.817
You should have just
let them expel me.

09:12.819 --> 09:14.052
"So"?

09:14.054 --> 09:16.688
What about your friends
and your teammates,

09:16.690 --> 09:18.823
not to mention
your entire future?

09:18.825 --> 09:20.692
Oh, jordy...

09:20.694 --> 09:23.061
You are gonna have to start
caring about something,

09:23.063 --> 09:24.229
sometime real soon.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.964
Life is so wasted
when you don't.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.899
Sure, mom.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.235
We're not done
talking about this.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.236
Morning.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.237
Morning, Claire.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.039
-Hey.
-Hi.

09:34.041 --> 09:35.206
Did you sleep okay?

09:35.208 --> 09:37.142
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

09:38.311 --> 09:40.345
Well, uh... shall we?

09:40.347 --> 09:41.346
Yes, please.

09:41.348 --> 09:42.847
5:30, jordy.

09:42.849 --> 09:44.816
Okay, mom.

09:46.852 --> 09:47.886
Bye.

09:47.888 --> 09:48.920
Have fun.

10:17.917 --> 10:19.050
December 21st,

10:19.052 --> 10:20.819
Pemberton forest.

10:20.821 --> 10:24.289
I've been in the migratory area
of the rusty blackbird

10:24.291 --> 10:25.890
for approximately
the last three hours

10:25.892 --> 10:30.295
and have not seen birds
of any kind.

10:30.297 --> 10:34.766
I am utterly baffled by this.

10:34.768 --> 10:37.035
Generally, this time of year,

10:37.037 --> 10:41.339
there'd be hundreds of them
in these woods.

10:41.341 --> 10:45.076
I'm not really sure
what to do right now.

10:48.681 --> 10:51.049
Where are you?

11:07.800 --> 11:10.001
What happened
to you, little fella?

11:28.688 --> 11:30.889
Where are all your friends?

12:01.954 --> 12:04.022
Looks like I'm going to be
late for dinner.

12:10.129 --> 12:11.096
Oh, yeah.

12:11.098 --> 12:12.731
Sorry, the only
spare I have

12:12.733 --> 12:12.731
is my brother's
mini bike.

12:12.733 --> 12:15.166
Wouldn't your brother
be pissed if I'm using this?

12:15.168 --> 12:15.166
I'd be.

12:15.168 --> 12:18.069
Um.. Not unless
you call him at college

12:18.071 --> 12:18.069
and tell him.

12:18.071 --> 12:21.106
You could keep it
while you're here

12:21.108 --> 12:22.273
if you want.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.008
God, yeah.

12:31.851 --> 12:34.419
Where is everybody?

12:34.421 --> 12:37.956
It's the off-season.

12:40.493 --> 12:44.829
So, this is
downtown Pemberton.

12:46.899 --> 12:48.399
And, uh, pretty much
the only hotel we have

12:48.401 --> 12:49.801
is right here.

12:49.803 --> 12:51.102
And then there's
a grocery store

12:51.104 --> 12:51.102
around the corner,

12:51.104 --> 12:53.171
but it's got
pretty much everything.

12:53.173 --> 12:55.907
And there's Fiona.

12:55.909 --> 12:57.776
She used to baby-sit me
when I was a kid.

12:57.778 --> 12:58.943
She taught me
how to quad,

12:58.945 --> 13:00.211
how to do
a French manicure.

13:00.213 --> 13:01.446
She's the best.

13:01.448 --> 13:02.781
So, the only
exciting things

13:02.783 --> 13:03.815
you can show me
in this town

13:03.817 --> 13:05.316
is a hotel
and a grocery store?

13:05.318 --> 13:06.317
Oh--

13:06.319 --> 13:07.452
I should be
in cabo right now.

13:07.454 --> 13:08.920
Poor Miami.

13:08.922 --> 13:10.021
You want to sit
in the sunshine

13:10.023 --> 13:11.523
drinking brewskies
with your bros?

13:11.525 --> 13:13.925
Can't hack the real
weather, huh?

13:13.927 --> 13:15.894
Come on, I'll buy you
a hot chocolate.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.862
Okay.

13:21.066 --> 13:22.400
So...

13:22.402 --> 13:24.269
How come you've never
come up here

13:24.271 --> 13:25.436
with your parents before?

13:25.438 --> 13:26.938
Work trips.

13:26.940 --> 13:29.974
Well, you could have
made it happen

13:29.976 --> 13:31.176
if you wanted it to.

13:31.178 --> 13:32.944
Well, I guess
they didn't want me

13:32.946 --> 13:35.980
roaming around the wilderness
unsupervised.

13:42.221 --> 13:43.822
You know...

13:43.824 --> 13:45.323
They talk about you
all the time.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.958
Yeah, sure.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.126
No, really,
they--

13:48.128 --> 13:49.227
whoa!

13:51.363 --> 13:52.497
What the hell was that?

13:52.499 --> 13:54.599
That was Mr. Watson,

13:54.601 --> 13:56.367
our resident Jeff Gordon.

13:56.369 --> 13:58.036
He's pretty mean,

13:58.038 --> 13:59.370
and he also drinks and drives,

13:59.372 --> 14:01.339
so I'd avoid him if I were you.

14:02.408 --> 14:04.008
Come on, Miami.

14:04.010 --> 14:06.311
Bet you've never seen
a real dump before.

14:06.313 --> 14:08.513
Anything to get off
these menacing streets.

14:53.592 --> 14:55.093
Hello?

14:59.665 --> 15:01.099
Hello!

15:04.436 --> 15:06.437
Didn't mean to barge in, I...

15:15.180 --> 15:19.417
Sorry, I... I knocked,
but nobody answered.

15:20.552 --> 15:22.553
Roger summers.

15:24.690 --> 15:26.391
It's Tim.

15:26.393 --> 15:30.929
I, uh, I was just wondering
if you might have a phone.

15:30.931 --> 15:30.929
I'm not getting any reception,

15:30.931 --> 15:34.399
and I'm late for dinner
with my wife and son.

15:35.467 --> 15:36.935
It's on the wall.

15:36.937 --> 15:38.202
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

16:01.393 --> 16:03.628
And this is the clinic
that your mom helps out at

16:03.630 --> 16:03.628
every summer.

16:03.630 --> 16:07.332
People round here would
go without medical treatment

16:07.334 --> 16:08.366
until it got real bad

16:08.368 --> 16:08.366
if she didn't.

16:08.368 --> 16:13.237
Civilization is a long way away.

16:14.273 --> 16:16.507
So, um...

16:16.509 --> 16:18.076
You wouldn't want to maybe

16:18.078 --> 16:19.410
hang out again tomorrow,
would you?

16:19.412 --> 16:21.679
I don't know if I can.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.147
I'm pretty busy with the b&b.

16:23.149 --> 16:24.115
Oh.

16:24.117 --> 16:26.050
No, yeah, no, it's...

16:26.052 --> 16:27.085
It's no biggie.

16:27.087 --> 16:28.119
I'm kidding.

16:28.121 --> 16:30.521
You're the only guest.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.156
Right.

16:32.158 --> 16:32.156
So, would you be up

16:32.158 --> 16:34.692
for something
a little more backwoodsy?

16:34.694 --> 16:36.995
Think you can handle
a real winter, jordy?

16:36.997 --> 16:38.997
Oh, I can handle it.

16:38.999 --> 16:38.997
I stopped shivering

16:38.999 --> 16:41.733
after my third cup
of hot chocolate, remember?

16:41.735 --> 16:44.736
This time,
you're gonna want your mittens.

16:44.738 --> 16:46.604
Right.

16:54.279 --> 16:56.147
Well, if you just
let her know that I called,

16:56.149 --> 16:57.248
and tell her I'm sorry

16:57.250 --> 16:59.017
I'm not going to make it
for dinner.

16:59.019 --> 17:00.418
All right, thank you.

17:09.694 --> 17:10.627
Get ahold of your wife?

17:12.397 --> 17:14.332
Uh, no, she was just
with a patient.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.534
I left a message
with the nurse.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.538
You're, uh,

17:20.540 --> 17:22.306
you're Dr. Tim Hughes,

17:22.308 --> 17:24.242
emergency
climate coalition.

17:24.243 --> 17:26.411
I was.

17:26.413 --> 17:28.613
I left the scientific community
a long time ago.

17:30.182 --> 17:32.216
Looks like you left
everything else, too.

17:33.585 --> 17:35.053
And why not?

17:35.055 --> 17:37.655
The planet
is dying, Roger,

17:37.657 --> 17:39.190
and we're the ones
killing it,

17:39.192 --> 17:41.292
and no one wants to do anything
to reverse it,

17:41.294 --> 17:44.529
because everybody
is making too much money.

17:46.131 --> 17:48.366
It seems to me that
you were making a difference.

17:48.368 --> 17:49.667
Kyoto.

17:49.669 --> 17:52.270
Emissions controls.

17:52.272 --> 17:54.572
A lot of that happened
because you raised your voice.

17:54.574 --> 17:58.142
It's like bailing out
the Titanic with a soup spoon.

17:59.211 --> 18:00.645
Well, you gotta start
somewhere, I figure.

18:02.147 --> 18:04.182
We're dead men walking,

18:04.184 --> 18:07.185
and no one seems to care.

18:08.854 --> 18:10.822
Do you think that
it could happen all at once?

18:10.824 --> 18:10.822
What?

18:10.824 --> 18:15.193
The climate disasters
that you forecast.

18:16.428 --> 18:20.698
The rusty blackbird's numbers
have been decreasing rapidly.

18:20.700 --> 18:23.734
This year, they migrated early.

18:24.870 --> 18:27.472
Today, I found this.

18:29.843 --> 18:32.610
It's frozen solid.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.512
It gets cold up here at night.

18:34.514 --> 18:37.215
It's not that cold.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.550
Something's very, very wrong.

18:44.823 --> 18:47.792
What's that, north of town?

18:50.262 --> 18:51.762
It's a research outpost.

18:51.764 --> 18:53.831
It's run by
multiple universities,

18:53.833 --> 18:55.766
couple of government agencies.

18:55.768 --> 18:57.135
Basically,
they study the weather,

18:57.137 --> 18:58.803
seismic activity,
tagging animals.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.738
Whatever they gotta do

19:00.740 --> 19:02.807
to spend
Grant money.

19:02.809 --> 19:02.807
I wonder if they might
have some data

19:02.809 --> 19:07.145
that might help me figure out
what's going on here.

19:07.147 --> 19:08.412
How long would it take me
to get up there?

19:08.414 --> 19:10.548
Depends on
how you intend to travel.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.583
On foot?

19:12.585 --> 19:13.784
Are you gonna go now?

19:13.786 --> 19:15.553
Well, if I come back tomorrow,

19:15.555 --> 19:17.255
then I'm going to have to travel
twice the distance.

19:18.390 --> 19:20.158
It's getting dark out there.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.359
Can't let you do that.

19:22.261 --> 19:23.895
You can bunk
down here tonight,

19:23.897 --> 19:25.730
and I'll take you in the morning
by snowmobile.

19:26.732 --> 19:28.766
Well, I'd appreciate that.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.836
I'm gonna have to
use your phone again.

19:32.838 --> 19:33.838
Knock yourself out.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.780
So, how was your date?

20:15.782 --> 20:17.248
It wasn't a date,

20:17.250 --> 20:19.784
but it was fine.

20:19.786 --> 20:21.886
Not so bad here
after all, is it?

20:21.888 --> 20:23.421
Dr. summers,

20:23.423 --> 20:23.421
your husband called twice.

20:23.423 --> 20:26.357
Once to say that he wouldn't
make it back tonight for dinner,

20:26.359 --> 20:27.425
and the second time to say

20:27.427 --> 20:28.993
that he wouldn't
make it back

20:28.995 --> 20:30.328
at all tonight.

20:30.330 --> 20:31.963
He said that
he was snowmobiling

20:31.965 --> 20:31.963
up to a research station

20:31.965 --> 20:34.899
with another scientist
he met in the woods?

20:34.901 --> 20:34.899
Does that make sense to you?

20:34.901 --> 20:37.268
Because it sounds like
the craziest thing

20:37.270 --> 20:37.268
I've ever heard.

20:37.270 --> 20:39.971
Well, you've obviously
never met my dad,

20:39.973 --> 20:42.240
because that's
actually typical.

20:42.242 --> 20:42.240
Oh, come on, jordy,

20:42.242 --> 20:44.242
we can still
have dinner together--

20:44.244 --> 20:45.610
no, forget it,
mom, okay?

20:45.612 --> 20:47.578
Let's just go back
to the b&b.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.382
I'm sorry.

20:51.384 --> 20:52.783
It's okay, lettie.

20:52.785 --> 20:54.552
It's not your fault.

21:12.404 --> 21:16.007
I appreciate
your helping me out.

21:16.009 --> 21:16.007
Just so you know,

21:16.009 --> 21:19.543
I don't give a damn
about your blackbird.

21:19.545 --> 21:21.779
I just don't want you
going out into the woods

21:21.781 --> 21:22.980
and getting yourself killed.

21:22.982 --> 21:24.615
I don't need that
on my conscience.

21:25.851 --> 21:28.619
You sound like my son.

22:06.658 --> 22:08.326
They should have
heard us coming.

22:08.328 --> 22:09.660
As boring as it is out here,

22:09.662 --> 22:11.862
they should be out here
with bells on.

22:12.998 --> 22:14.465
That can't be good.

22:24.743 --> 22:25.710
Thanks.

22:25.712 --> 22:26.944
Yeah.

22:35.554 --> 22:38.489
Hello?

22:44.629 --> 22:46.897
Shouldn't the generator
have kicked in?

22:46.899 --> 22:48.866
Maybe it's frozen.

22:48.868 --> 22:50.668
Yeah.

23:22.834 --> 23:24.535
Frozen solid.

23:24.537 --> 23:26.771
How is that even possible?

23:26.773 --> 23:28.038
I don't know,

23:28.040 --> 23:28.038
but right now,

23:28.040 --> 23:31.075
I think we need to worry
about it happening again

23:31.077 --> 23:32.643
and not how it happened.

23:32.645 --> 23:34.445
Agreed.

23:34.447 --> 23:35.546
The missing birds,

23:35.548 --> 23:37.114
it suggests that
this isn't random.

23:37.116 --> 23:39.083
Animals are smarter than humans.
They know.

23:40.419 --> 23:42.720
Think we better get
that generator started,

23:42.722 --> 23:44.955
maybe fire up the computers,
see if they recorded anything.

23:44.957 --> 23:46.424
Take this walkie.

23:46.426 --> 23:47.525
We'll stay in touch.

23:47.527 --> 23:49.794
I'll take the guys outside.

23:49.796 --> 23:51.195
We'll arrange
to bury them later.

23:51.197 --> 23:52.730
All right.

24:18.723 --> 24:20.724
So... how do you like
the north now, Miami?

24:20.726 --> 24:22.626
It is awesome.

24:22.628 --> 24:24.962
It's like being on
a freezing cold jet ski.

24:24.964 --> 24:28.098
Except, you know, with
a lot more clothes on.

24:28.100 --> 24:28.098
Right.

24:28.100 --> 24:31.702
Come on, I want to
show you something cool.

24:51.022 --> 24:52.156
We got power.

24:52.158 --> 24:53.524
Nice work, Roger.

24:53.526 --> 24:54.758
Now, get back here

24:54.760 --> 24:56.827
and let's figure out
how this thing happened.

25:16.781 --> 25:18.716
Wow.

25:27.927 --> 25:30.160
Empty.

25:30.162 --> 25:32.196
Nothing but us.

25:32.198 --> 25:32.196
You could yell

25:32.198 --> 25:35.232
your deepest, darkest
secrets from this spot,

25:35.234 --> 25:36.800
and no one
will hear you.

25:37.969 --> 25:39.837
This is my favorite spot.

25:40.906 --> 25:42.873
Come on, you try.

25:54.319 --> 25:56.720
Beautiful.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.723
I mean, it's...

25:59.725 --> 26:02.893
It's beautiful
out here.

26:19.244 --> 26:20.778
What the...

26:23.281 --> 26:25.015
Roger?

26:25.017 --> 26:26.183
Roger, you've got to
get inside now.

26:26.185 --> 26:28.118
The temperatures are plummeting.

26:29.188 --> 26:30.921
Roger, do you copy?

26:50.275 --> 26:52.176
<i> Roger--</i>

26:55.280 --> 26:57.047
<i> Roger!</i>

27:08.660 --> 27:10.694
We've got to feed the fire.
We can't let it go out.

27:15.133 --> 27:16.367
Whoa, cool!

27:16.369 --> 27:17.801
No...

27:17.803 --> 27:19.903
No, that was weird.

27:19.905 --> 27:21.705
We should go.

27:21.707 --> 27:23.741
Uh, one thing that you
never mess with up here

27:23.743 --> 27:24.775
is weird weather.

27:24.777 --> 27:25.976
We should
get out of here.

27:38.089 --> 27:39.657
Hey, how'd it go?

27:39.659 --> 27:41.025
Are you engaged yet?

27:41.027 --> 27:42.793
I think we've got to have
the third date first

27:42.795 --> 27:43.861
before talking about eternity.

27:43.863 --> 27:46.897
So there's going
to be a third date?

27:46.899 --> 27:48.666
I hope so.

27:48.668 --> 27:50.134
Well, uh, your dad
isn't here yet,

27:50.136 --> 27:50.134
and I need to finish up,

27:50.136 --> 27:52.970
so just try to keep yourself
busy for a few minutes,

27:52.972 --> 27:54.438
-I'll come find you?
-Yeah, sure.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.974
Where's Claire?

27:56.976 --> 27:58.676
You should have invited her
to have dinner with us.

27:58.678 --> 27:59.677
I could go
check on her,

27:59.679 --> 28:00.944
if you want.

28:00.946 --> 28:02.446
You're not going anywhere,
don Juan.

28:02.448 --> 28:03.414
I will meet you
in the waiting room

28:03.416 --> 28:04.682
in 20 minutes.

28:04.684 --> 28:06.316
This family dinner
will happen.

28:06.318 --> 28:09.920
Just stay out of trouble,
and out of everyone's way,

28:09.922 --> 28:10.988
okay?

28:10.990 --> 28:12.756
No promises.

28:12.758 --> 28:13.824
And who is
don Juan?

28:13.826 --> 28:15.359
Is he the dude
riding the donkeys

28:15.361 --> 28:16.360
on the coffee cans?

28:17.829 --> 28:19.296
Yes.

28:37.115 --> 28:39.717
Damn it.

28:39.719 --> 28:41.351
Cold kills the batteries.

28:41.353 --> 28:42.853
Yeah.

28:42.855 --> 28:45.055
My family's going to be
starting to worry

28:45.057 --> 28:46.857
right about now.

28:46.859 --> 28:49.026
I've got to find some way
to get a message to them.

28:49.028 --> 28:49.026
I checked.

28:49.028 --> 28:52.996
Nothing here that communicates
with the outside world

28:52.998 --> 28:54.064
is working.

28:55.967 --> 28:57.935
You find anything else useful?

29:01.172 --> 29:02.773
Well?

29:02.775 --> 29:04.875
According to the data

29:04.877 --> 29:07.311
collected by the weather
monitoring equipment

29:07.313 --> 29:08.345
before it went out,

29:08.347 --> 29:10.013
suggests
that we're experiencing

29:10.015 --> 29:12.883
an upper atmospheric
cyclonic event.

29:12.885 --> 29:14.818
It could be stratospheric,

29:14.820 --> 29:16.120
maybe mesospheric,

29:16.122 --> 29:17.121
I don't know.

29:17.123 --> 29:19.156
It's unprecedented,

29:19.158 --> 29:22.993
and this is what's dropping
temperatures so quickly?

29:22.995 --> 29:22.993
The air is being pulled up

29:22.995 --> 29:27.197
into the upper reaches
of the atmosphere.

29:27.199 --> 29:28.966
It's getting supercooled.

29:28.968 --> 29:30.534
As it cools,
it gains density,

29:30.536 --> 29:35.439
and drops back down to the earth
as a sub-freezing blast of wind.

29:37.175 --> 29:38.842
It's like a pinwheel,

29:38.844 --> 29:40.944
blowing tendrils of cold
off of a fan.

29:40.946 --> 29:43.080
That's why it's not
hitting everywhere at once?

29:43.082 --> 29:43.080
Its tendrils?

29:43.082 --> 29:46.316
Otherwise people
would have noticed.

29:46.318 --> 29:46.316
Exactly.

29:46.318 --> 29:49.553
It's not setting off alarms
because it appears isolated.

29:49.555 --> 29:50.921
But it's not.

29:50.923 --> 29:55.092
The next one should hit
at 2:06 A.M.

29:55.094 --> 29:57.795
It's going to last 10 minutes
and 15 seconds.

29:57.797 --> 29:58.929
We are in the center,

29:58.931 --> 30:00.464
the most intense
part of the storm.

30:00.466 --> 30:01.932
If that's the case,

30:01.934 --> 30:03.934
then Pemberton
could get hit, too.

30:03.936 --> 30:05.936
Yeah, the tail end,

30:05.938 --> 30:07.437
but it won't be as cold
there as it is here,

30:07.439 --> 30:08.539
at least not yet.

30:08.541 --> 30:10.240
So, are we going to
be okay here?

30:11.342 --> 30:13.277
For now.

30:14.579 --> 30:17.447
What's the cause of it?

30:17.449 --> 30:19.183
The cause?

30:20.252 --> 30:21.819
Emissions.

30:21.821 --> 30:23.053
Holes in the ozone.

30:23.055 --> 30:24.888
Nuclear reactors
warming our oceans.

30:24.890 --> 30:24.888
Take your pick.

30:24.890 --> 30:28.292
We could be looking at
a new ice age.

30:28.294 --> 30:31.228
But on the plus side,

30:31.230 --> 30:33.997
the cold zones
are relatively low.

30:33.999 --> 30:36.300
The blasts of wind
are basically on the surface.

30:37.502 --> 30:40.137
No higher than
8,000 feet,

30:40.139 --> 30:42.272
so at least we won't have
any planes

30:42.274 --> 30:44.408
falling from the skies.

30:44.410 --> 30:45.509
Great.

30:45.511 --> 30:47.044
At least that's something.

30:48.446 --> 30:51.148
So, what can we do about it?

30:51.150 --> 30:53.016
Nothing.

30:53.018 --> 30:54.184
What do you mean, nothing?

30:54.186 --> 30:54.184
I mean, nothing.

30:54.186 --> 31:01.191
Our control over this domain,
it ends here.

31:01.193 --> 31:03.060
So what, we just,
we just die?

31:03.062 --> 31:05.462
You, me, everyone else?

31:07.265 --> 31:09.566
There's got to be some way
that we can combat it.

31:09.568 --> 31:12.536
Roger, the cyclone,

31:12.538 --> 31:15.005
up there, it's growing.

31:15.007 --> 31:16.506
More and more air
is getting pulled up into it.

31:16.508 --> 31:21.578
Its frequency is increasing
by 50% with each turn.

31:21.580 --> 31:23.280
It's only a matter of time

31:23.282 --> 31:24.882
before it threatens the entire
northern hemisphere.

31:24.884 --> 31:26.884
The survival zones,

31:26.886 --> 31:28.418
the gaps between the tendrils,
they're closing.

31:28.420 --> 31:30.621
It's becoming one giant blast.

31:30.623 --> 31:32.256
So--so what...

31:32.258 --> 31:34.458
How long
does the danger zone last?

31:34.460 --> 31:36.026
What's the duration of it?

31:36.028 --> 31:38.462
The duration
is increasing as well.

31:38.464 --> 31:42.532
As I said, the next one
is 10 minutes and 15 seconds.

31:42.534 --> 31:43.901
Then 14 minutes
and 32 seconds,

31:43.903 --> 31:45.602
and then 18 minutes
and 80 seconds.

31:45.604 --> 31:48.005
I don't know,
22 minutes, 26 minutes,

31:48.007 --> 31:49.373
so on, and so on, and so on!

31:49.375 --> 31:51.575
All right, so it increases
by four minutes

31:51.577 --> 31:53.110
every single time,

31:53.112 --> 31:56.113
it's like this..
Self-sustaining wind.

31:57.315 --> 31:58.916
It's going to kill
everything in its path.

31:58.918 --> 32:01.585
Weather is self-regulating,
isn't it?

32:01.587 --> 32:03.620
I mean, it'll
stabilize eventually.

32:03.622 --> 32:05.022
I mean, there must be
some kind of way

32:05.024 --> 32:06.256
that we can accelerate that.

32:06.258 --> 32:07.257
No.

32:07.259 --> 32:09.259
Too late.

32:10.295 --> 32:13.330
No one listened
when we had a chance.

32:13.332 --> 32:15.132
We're done.

32:15.134 --> 32:17.334
There's got to be something
we can do stop it.

32:17.336 --> 32:19.403
How?

32:19.405 --> 32:19.403
What do you want me to do?

32:19.405 --> 32:22.339
What, you want to shoot
a rocket into space?

32:22.341 --> 32:24.107
Blow up a nuke?

32:24.109 --> 32:26.476
No one is looking for it,

32:26.478 --> 32:28.111
not for this.

32:28.113 --> 32:29.680
We have no communications,

32:29.682 --> 32:32.616
we got nothing.

32:32.618 --> 32:35.185
How are we
supposed to stop it?

32:36.254 --> 32:37.621
I don't know.

32:38.623 --> 32:41.191
But you might.

32:41.193 --> 32:44.962
I know
who you are, Tim.

32:44.964 --> 32:46.630
I know that
you tried for years

32:46.632 --> 32:48.131
to convince the world

32:48.133 --> 32:52.336
about the dangers
of climate change.

32:52.338 --> 32:56.073
There certainly was a point
where you cared about people.

32:56.075 --> 32:59.209
Yes, I spent my entire career,

32:59.211 --> 33:00.744
my life,

33:00.746 --> 33:02.746
trying to get the world
to understand

33:02.748 --> 33:04.648
the dangers we faced,

33:04.650 --> 33:06.616
and what did I get?

33:06.618 --> 33:08.085
I got ignored,

33:08.087 --> 33:11.088
ridiculed, rebuffed,

33:11.090 --> 33:13.156
and threatened.

33:17.395 --> 33:19.629
Well, this is about more
than just us, now, though,

33:19.631 --> 33:22.132
isn't it?

33:22.134 --> 33:23.767
I read about what happened

33:23.769 --> 33:25.569
to your...

33:25.571 --> 33:28.438
Your wife and daughter,

33:28.440 --> 33:31.608
their death in Katrina.

33:31.610 --> 33:32.576
I mean, there are no words.

33:32.578 --> 33:34.611
It's tragic.

33:35.513 --> 33:38.615
But there are other
families out there.

33:39.684 --> 33:43.387
My family is out there.

34:37.375 --> 34:39.342
Good evening, nurse lettie.

34:39.344 --> 34:40.377
Hey, Jordan.

34:41.612 --> 34:42.679
How's it going?

34:42.681 --> 34:44.481
How are you
liking it here so far?

34:44.483 --> 34:47.717
Okay, well, between
just you and me,

34:47.719 --> 34:49.119
I'm kind of glad

34:49.121 --> 34:50.353
I'm not in cabo
right now.

34:52.424 --> 34:53.790
So, um...

34:53.792 --> 34:55.257
So, Claire's
a nice girl.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.161
Hey...

34:58.163 --> 34:59.830
Is there anything good
in the lost and found?

34:59.832 --> 35:02.566
I doubt it,
but you can have a look.

35:04.635 --> 35:07.270
So, Claire, um...

35:07.272 --> 35:09.573
Do you know if she's
seeing anybody, or anything?

35:10.475 --> 35:12.242
I'm pretty sure Claire
would tell you

35:12.244 --> 35:14.811
if she had a boyfriend.

35:14.813 --> 35:15.679
If that's what
you're asking.

35:15.681 --> 35:16.713
What? No, I...

35:19.650 --> 35:19.649
Hello.

35:19.651 --> 35:21.718
You never know what
you're going to find

35:21.720 --> 35:23.220
in the lost and found.

35:28.793 --> 35:30.393
Oh...

35:44.209 --> 35:46.543
Well, so much
for an easy night.

36:14.539 --> 36:15.605
Hey.

36:17.241 --> 36:18.441
Sorry, kiddo.

36:18.443 --> 36:19.776
With these rolling
power outages,

36:19.778 --> 36:22.312
it got real busy here.

36:22.314 --> 36:25.582
We're one of the only
places with a generator.

36:26.817 --> 36:29.186
Where's your dad?

36:29.188 --> 36:30.687
He didn't show up.

36:30.689 --> 36:32.889
Again.

36:32.891 --> 36:34.958
That's odd.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.459
No, not really.

36:36.461 --> 36:37.561
He didn't show up
last time.

36:37.563 --> 36:40.497
Why would today
be any different?

36:40.499 --> 36:41.598
Excuse me.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.333
Excuse me?

36:43.335 --> 36:45.268
Can I get some help
here, ma'am?

36:45.270 --> 36:47.671
Of course, sir.

36:47.673 --> 36:49.372
I'm sorry, jordy.

36:49.374 --> 36:50.574
I have to take care of this.

36:50.576 --> 36:52.509
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

36:54.946 --> 36:56.346
Okay, let's see,

36:56.348 --> 36:58.381
what do we have here?

36:58.383 --> 37:00.483
All right--
oh, watch your back.

37:02.386 --> 37:03.787
It's okay, it's okay.
Careful.

37:03.789 --> 37:05.689
What happened?

37:05.691 --> 37:05.689
It's Mr. Watson.

37:05.691 --> 37:09.726
Frozen solid in
his scooter last night.

37:10.795 --> 37:12.462
Jordan...

37:13.497 --> 37:15.632
The look on his face,
sheer terror.

37:15.634 --> 37:18.668
Like he was running
away from something.

37:18.670 --> 37:21.371
How does something
like this even happen?

37:21.373 --> 37:24.341
Damndest thing
I've ever seen.

37:37.555 --> 37:40.357
No service.

37:40.359 --> 37:41.791
They don't even know
what's coming,

37:41.793 --> 37:43.526
and they're not gonna.

37:45.463 --> 37:48.298
My wife's been coming up here
with me to volunteer for years.

37:48.300 --> 37:50.600
This is the first time
that my kid's ever come.

37:51.902 --> 37:54.604
I can't even warn them
to stay inside.

37:56.040 --> 37:59.609
I can't warn
anybody.

37:59.611 --> 37:59.609
You can't warn them,

37:59.611 --> 38:04.414
but maybe you can
get them out.

38:04.416 --> 38:07.684
We can't stop the storm,
but we can run from it.

38:07.686 --> 38:07.684
At least we can try.

38:07.686 --> 38:10.553
What are you talking about?

38:10.555 --> 38:13.490
There's a helipad
just north of town.

38:14.692 --> 38:15.859
8,000 feet.

38:15.861 --> 38:17.560
Yeah, that's right.

38:17.562 --> 38:18.561
Look.

38:18.563 --> 38:18.561
There.

38:18.563 --> 38:22.966
Anywhere south of there,
they can survive the storm.

38:22.968 --> 38:25.835
It's the only place
they'll be safe.

38:25.837 --> 38:28.571
I mean, it's a chance.

38:30.708 --> 38:31.741
I'll take it.

38:40.484 --> 38:42.852
Temperatures have returned
to safe levels.

38:42.854 --> 38:44.454
We should move.

38:44.456 --> 38:45.922
Yeah.

38:47.391 --> 38:48.992
Well, there you go,
Mr. Wallace.

38:48.994 --> 38:51.461
It's good as new.

38:51.463 --> 38:52.529
Although i
wouldn't recommend

38:52.531 --> 38:53.963
going back out
on the ice tonight.

38:53.965 --> 38:53.963
You should rest

38:53.965 --> 38:56.900
and keep that hand dry
for a few days.

38:56.902 --> 38:58.501
Don't worry, doc.

38:58.503 --> 39:00.337
Cold happens up here.

39:00.339 --> 39:01.771
It's not like
it's some evil monster

39:01.773 --> 39:03.406
out to get you.

39:03.408 --> 39:05.442
It just happens.

39:06.844 --> 39:07.877
Tourists...

39:07.879 --> 39:09.679
Well--

39:09.681 --> 39:12.749
uh, lettie, um,
has my husband checked in?

39:12.751 --> 39:14.551
No.

39:14.553 --> 39:16.653
Can you
come get me when he calls?

39:16.655 --> 39:16.653
I can,

39:16.655 --> 39:19.823
but listen, he's been
coming here for over 20 years.

39:19.825 --> 39:19.823
He's not nearly as green

39:19.825 --> 39:23.360
as everybody is
making him out to be.

39:23.362 --> 39:25.528
I'm sure he's fine, okay?

39:25.530 --> 39:26.996
Thanks.
I appreciate it.

39:26.998 --> 39:28.598
Okay.

39:37.842 --> 39:37.841
Snowmobile's ready.

39:37.843 --> 39:40.944
I siphoned some gasoline
from the generator.

39:40.946 --> 39:42.011
If we leave soon,

39:42.013 --> 39:43.012
we can make it
to your cabin

39:43.014 --> 39:44.047
before the blast hits.

39:44.049 --> 39:44.047
I'm not coming with you.

39:44.049 --> 39:47.150
The hell you're not,
you'll die here.

39:47.152 --> 39:48.952
You were right.

39:48.954 --> 39:48.952
No one knows about this,

39:48.954 --> 39:52.455
and a phone call
isn't going to convince anyone.

39:52.457 --> 39:52.455
Governments need real proof

39:52.457 --> 39:54.858
before they're
going to spend money.

39:54.860 --> 39:56.426
They need this data.

39:56.428 --> 39:57.627
If they had it, they might try.

39:58.829 --> 40:00.130
Tim--

40:00.132 --> 40:01.631
hundreds of millions
are gonna die.

40:01.633 --> 40:03.166
I can't have that on my head.

40:03.168 --> 40:06.002
Not when I'm the only person
on the planet

40:06.004 --> 40:07.670
who can do something about it.

40:08.572 --> 40:10.673
What are you going to do?

40:10.675 --> 40:14.644
I've just got to figure out
a way to get the signal out.

40:15.813 --> 40:17.580
All right, I'll go,
I'll warn my family,

40:17.582 --> 40:18.681
and I'll come back.

40:18.683 --> 40:20.784
This storm,
it's not going to stop.

40:20.786 --> 40:23.787
It's going to blow
until it blows itself out.

40:23.789 --> 40:23.787
And hey, I...

40:23.789 --> 40:27.557
I came to the north
to die anyway.

40:27.559 --> 40:28.892
My wife, she'd think
it was pretty funny,

40:28.894 --> 40:31.528
me dying like this.

40:32.196 --> 40:33.430
Yeah...

40:33.432 --> 40:35.532
Go save your family.

40:35.534 --> 40:38.101
I'm good with this.

40:48.612 --> 40:51.781
Hey, jordy, can you
turn on the news?

40:53.751 --> 40:56.119
<i> The cold weather anomalies</i>
<i> that are reaping havoc</i>

40:56.121 --> 40:58.054
<i> all over</i>
<i> the northern hemisphere</i>

40:58.056 --> 41:00.223
<i> are still baffling scientists.</i>

41:00.225 --> 41:04.527
<i> Russia reports power outages</i>
<i>to at least four million people,</i>

41:04.529 --> 41:07.197
<i> and parts of Canada</i>
<i> are without communication.</i>

41:07.199 --> 41:07.197
<i> Now, at home,</i>

41:07.199 --> 41:10.600
<i> the weather board has not made</i>
<i> any official comment,</i>

41:10.602 --> 41:12.769
<i> and the white house</i>
<i> is asking Americans</i>

41:12.771 --> 41:15.605
<i>to stay indoors and remain calm.</i>

41:15.607 --> 41:17.474
We should go
and look for dad.

41:17.476 --> 41:19.142
I mean, he should
been back by now.

41:19.144 --> 41:21.244
You have no idea
where he is,

41:21.246 --> 41:22.479
no idea where
you're going,

41:22.481 --> 41:24.047
and no way
to get there.

41:24.049 --> 41:25.148
I don't care.

41:25.150 --> 41:28.017
I mean, we should
at least try.

41:28.019 --> 41:29.953
Jordy, he's a grown-up.

41:29.955 --> 41:32.522
It's not your job
to worry about him.

41:34.226 --> 41:35.258
Candace,

41:35.260 --> 41:37.260
Wilma is on the phone.

41:37.262 --> 41:38.828
She thinks she might have

41:38.830 --> 41:39.963
swallowed a spider.

41:39.965 --> 41:41.498
Okay.

41:41.500 --> 41:42.899
I gotta get this.

41:45.970 --> 41:48.538
Yeah, well...

41:48.540 --> 41:49.772
I do worry about him.

42:40.824 --> 42:42.025
Answer.

42:59.243 --> 43:02.845
Come on, Candace, pick up.

43:13.992 --> 43:14.991
Dad?

43:14.993 --> 43:16.759
Jordy!

43:16.761 --> 43:18.595
Nice, dad.
Nice no-show.

43:18.597 --> 43:20.730
I'm sorry.

43:20.732 --> 43:23.066
I'm sorry I had you
come up here.

43:23.068 --> 43:25.268
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
i wasn't around more

43:25.270 --> 43:26.269
when you were younger,

43:26.271 --> 43:26.269
and you wanted me to be,

43:26.271 --> 43:26.269
but I want you to know
you're number one.

43:26.271 --> 43:31.140
All right? You and your mom,
you're number one.

43:31.142 --> 43:32.175
I love you, jordy.

43:32.177 --> 43:34.010
Dad?

43:34.012 --> 43:35.378
What's wrong?

43:35.380 --> 43:38.681
There's a terrible storm coming.

43:38.683 --> 43:38.681
<i> And when the wind blows,</i>

43:38.683 --> 43:41.851
<i> if you're outside,</i>
<i> it will freeze you solid,</i>

43:41.853 --> 43:43.019
so you've got to stay inside,
all right?

43:43.021 --> 43:44.187
You hear me?

43:44.189 --> 43:45.221
I hear you.

43:45.223 --> 43:46.623
Okay, so where are you?

43:46.625 --> 43:48.291
At the clinic, me and mom.

43:48.293 --> 43:49.926
That's good.
It's a new building,

43:49.928 --> 43:51.027
and it's got
emergency power there.

43:51.029 --> 43:51.027
You're gonna be...

43:51.029 --> 43:54.364
You're gonna be just fine there
for a while, all right?

43:54.366 --> 43:55.932
Now, this storm is gonna
hit Pemberton

43:55.934 --> 43:57.667
at 11:06, okay?

43:57.669 --> 44:00.903
It's going to blow for
18 minutes and 32 seconds,

44:00.905 --> 44:03.706
and you, you've gotta be inside
during that time period.

44:03.708 --> 44:05.775
Now, here's what
you've got to look for, okay?

44:05.777 --> 44:07.777
<i> The wind is gonna</i>
<i> change direction.</i>

44:07.779 --> 44:09.178
You've gotta be inside
during that time period.

44:09.180 --> 44:10.880
Are you okay, dad?

44:10.882 --> 44:12.715
I'm coming for you, all right?

44:12.717 --> 44:13.850
I'm gonna--

44:14.818 --> 44:16.119
dad?

44:16.121 --> 44:17.186
Dad!

44:19.890 --> 44:21.224
<i> Tim?</i>

44:22.427 --> 44:24.827
<i> Tim?</i>

44:24.829 --> 44:24.827
Yeah.

44:24.829 --> 44:27.830
I got a message out
to my family.

44:27.832 --> 44:29.866
They know enough now.

44:29.868 --> 44:31.668
<i> I'm on my way to them.</i>

44:31.670 --> 44:31.668
That is great news.
Hey, listen,

44:31.670 --> 44:35.738
<i> I think I figured out a way</i>
<i> to transmit the data.</i>

44:35.740 --> 44:38.775
I've just got to get it
up to the airwaves.

44:38.777 --> 44:40.209
<i> Get your family to the helipad</i>
<i> and you get 'em out.</i>

44:40.211 --> 44:41.778
Will do.

44:42.446 --> 44:43.846
Tim?

44:43.848 --> 44:44.714
Yeah.

44:44.716 --> 44:46.315
Save as many as you can.

44:46.317 --> 44:47.750
You got it.

44:47.752 --> 44:50.787
Listen, make sure the, um,

44:50.789 --> 44:52.855
the actor that plays me
in the movie

44:52.857 --> 44:54.190
is better looking than
the actor that plays you.

44:54.192 --> 44:55.324
It's got to be realistic.

44:55.326 --> 44:56.359
Copy that.

44:56.361 --> 44:58.928
Good luck to you, Roger.

45:12.276 --> 45:13.276
Power's out again.

45:13.278 --> 45:14.243
Is there coffee?

45:14.245 --> 45:15.311
Yeah.

45:18.348 --> 45:20.083
It's freezing.

45:28.292 --> 45:29.859
Hey, everyone.

45:29.861 --> 45:31.994
I just got off
with dispatch.

45:31.996 --> 45:35.031
Now, the power's going to be
messed up for a while.

45:35.033 --> 45:37.066
I guess the news is saying
that we should all stay inside.

45:37.068 --> 45:38.935
Personally, I'm heading
back to the city

45:38.937 --> 45:40.069
while there's still time.

45:40.071 --> 45:41.404
No power?

45:41.406 --> 45:43.239
I'm on electric at home.

45:43.241 --> 45:44.474
I'll catch my death of cold.

45:44.476 --> 45:46.976
You guys cannot
go outside yet.

45:46.978 --> 45:47.844
Hold on.

45:47.846 --> 45:48.945
Hello, everyone.

45:48.947 --> 45:50.513
My name is
Dr. Candace summers.

45:50.515 --> 45:52.281
My husband
is Roger summers.

45:52.283 --> 45:52.281
Most of you know us

45:52.283 --> 45:54.417
from our annual
summer trips up here.

45:54.419 --> 45:56.953
He's informed me

45:56.955 --> 45:59.856
that a dangerous storm
is headed this way.

45:59.858 --> 46:01.424
Freezing winds,
actually.

46:01.426 --> 46:04.093
Look, I don't know
all the details.

46:04.095 --> 46:06.062
There's nothing
on the news about a storm.

46:06.064 --> 46:06.062
That's because they don't know.

46:06.064 --> 46:10.399
We've all been through
this kind of weather before.

46:10.401 --> 46:12.535
It's nothing new,
isn't that right?

46:12.537 --> 46:14.103
This is different.

46:14.105 --> 46:16.339
If you go outside when it hits,

46:16.341 --> 46:17.473
you'll freeze to death

46:17.475 --> 46:18.541
in a matter
of seconds.

46:19.544 --> 46:21.778
If a storm's coming,

46:21.780 --> 46:22.779
we need to get
back to the road.

46:22.781 --> 46:24.180
You're not
listening, okay?

46:24.182 --> 46:25.782
None of you are safe.

46:25.784 --> 46:27.049
Your homes, they may
not be warm enough

46:27.051 --> 46:28.785
to keep you and
your families alive.

46:28.787 --> 46:30.787
Where are we
supposed to go?

46:30.789 --> 46:33.356
We should all stay here.

46:33.358 --> 46:34.457
Inside, for the time being.

46:34.459 --> 46:36.492
And then what?

46:36.494 --> 46:37.527
We wait for my husband.

46:37.529 --> 46:38.561
He'll have a plan.

46:38.563 --> 46:40.329
She's from Miami.

46:40.331 --> 46:41.364
Well, that
explains it.

46:42.566 --> 46:44.333
Honey, we should go with him.

46:44.335 --> 46:44.333
No, you're not--

46:44.335 --> 46:47.136
kid, I drive truck through
all kinds of weather.

46:47.138 --> 46:48.905
I'm getting
while the getting's good.

46:48.907 --> 46:50.339
But it's not good.

46:50.341 --> 46:52.341
You have to stay here.

46:52.343 --> 46:53.943
You won't be safe
out there.

46:53.945 --> 46:56.345
My partner is loading up
a patient for transfer

46:56.347 --> 46:56.345
right now.

46:56.347 --> 47:00.149
It's an eight-hour drive
down south to the city.

47:00.151 --> 47:01.918
We can't just stay here,
we've got a job to do.

47:01.920 --> 47:03.019
Maybe we'll come with you.

47:03.021 --> 47:05.388
Okay, we got a convoy.

47:05.390 --> 47:07.523
No, wait,
please.

47:07.525 --> 47:09.458
My husband
will be here soon.

47:09.460 --> 47:10.893
He's on his way.

47:10.895 --> 47:13.229
He has all the information
about this storm.

47:13.231 --> 47:15.364
If you could just wait
for a few more minutes,

47:15.366 --> 47:16.432
please!

47:16.434 --> 47:18.034
We deal with
bad weather here

47:18.036 --> 47:19.335
all the time, doctor.

47:19.337 --> 47:22.505
If we're not out there
helping folks, no one is.

47:22.507 --> 47:24.440
Please...

47:52.402 --> 47:55.571
All right, I've got 30 minutes.

47:55.573 --> 47:57.940
Okay, what am i
going to do here?

48:00.277 --> 48:01.944
Shelter.

48:25.302 --> 48:26.335
I'm going to get Claire.

48:26.337 --> 48:27.670
No, you're not.

48:27.672 --> 48:28.671
You're going to stay
right here

48:28.673 --> 48:31.140
like your father
asked you to.

48:31.142 --> 48:33.643
The clinic is much better
insulated than the b&b.

48:33.645 --> 48:35.511
That is exactly why
i have to go get her.

48:35.513 --> 48:37.046
She doesn't even know
that she's in danger out there.

48:37.048 --> 48:40.383
Jordan summers, I forbid you
to leave this building.

48:43.520 --> 48:44.587
Come on.

50:30.027 --> 50:32.561
Please, god,

50:32.563 --> 50:35.231
let this work.

50:36.600 --> 50:40.136
I want to see my family again.

50:46.343 --> 50:49.045
Crash victim in room seven
just checked himself out.

50:49.047 --> 50:50.713
That was
our last patient.

50:50.715 --> 50:52.281
Oh, no.

50:52.283 --> 50:54.417
I don't know what to do
if they won't listen.

50:54.419 --> 50:56.685
You know, this town
is full of hard-working,

50:56.687 --> 50:56.685
decent people,

50:56.687 --> 51:00.556
and every single one of them
is hard-headed.

51:00.558 --> 51:01.624
We survive out here.

51:01.626 --> 51:03.826
I didn't get
to speak with Roger,

51:03.828 --> 51:06.195
but from what Jordan said,

51:06.197 --> 51:08.831
I don't if there will be
survivors this time.

51:08.833 --> 51:11.200
It's what we do, Candace.

51:12.736 --> 51:15.671
Where's Jordan?

51:17.407 --> 51:19.241
Jordy?

51:24.081 --> 51:26.515
We have to find him.

51:30.087 --> 51:32.388
Jordan!

52:24.307 --> 52:26.609
Go! Now!

52:35.852 --> 52:37.686
Get back!
Move! Move!

52:39.423 --> 52:40.489
Oh, god...

53:41.218 --> 53:43.586
All right.

53:44.888 --> 53:46.422
Come on, baby.

53:50.861 --> 53:51.894
Yeah!

53:51.896 --> 53:54.897
Atta girl.
Atta girl.

54:40.710 --> 54:41.810
Really?

54:41.812 --> 54:43.345
Damnit!

55:02.032 --> 55:03.399
Come on!

55:49.713 --> 55:50.746
We're closed, sir.

55:50.748 --> 55:53.916
-You scared the hell outta me.
-I'm Fiona.

55:55.018 --> 55:56.518
Roger.
What are you doing here?

55:56.520 --> 55:57.686
It was so cold at home.

55:57.688 --> 55:59.021
I thought
it would be warmer here,

55:59.023 --> 56:01.357
but I was wrong.
It's worse here.

56:01.359 --> 56:03.559
This building isn't
insulated enough.

56:03.561 --> 56:04.593
We've gotta get out of here.

56:04.595 --> 56:06.495
What's going on out there?

56:07.964 --> 56:09.465
Something is cooling
the atmosphere

56:09.467 --> 56:10.532
to the point where

56:10.534 --> 56:11.867
the temperature outside
is dropping

56:11.869 --> 56:12.935
below survivable levels.

56:12.937 --> 56:15.371
It's not even snowing
out there.

56:15.373 --> 56:16.839
It's too cold outside to snow.

56:18.108 --> 56:19.441
What should we do?

56:20.143 --> 56:22.511
We've got to get
inside a cooler.

56:22.513 --> 56:24.646
You want me
to get in a fridge?

56:24.648 --> 56:26.749
Look, I'm just making it up
as I go along.

56:26.751 --> 56:27.683
I'm no expert here.

56:27.685 --> 56:29.151
Great.

56:29.153 --> 56:30.486
Well, you're still alive.

56:30.488 --> 56:31.920
That's something, I guess.

56:31.922 --> 56:32.921
That's right.

56:32.923 --> 56:32.921
Come on.

56:35.392 --> 56:37.393
The cooler will be
well insulated.

56:37.395 --> 56:37.393
It'll be cool in there,

56:37.395 --> 56:41.063
but it will be a heck of a lot
warmer than out here.

56:41.065 --> 56:42.398
You hope.

56:42.400 --> 56:43.599
I do. I hope.

56:48.471 --> 56:49.838
At least
we won't starve.

56:49.840 --> 56:52.474
We won't need to be
in here too long.

56:52.476 --> 56:52.474
It'll be 26 minutes,

56:52.476 --> 56:55.677
then the temperature
will come up temporarily,

56:55.679 --> 56:57.446
then we can go
to the clinic.

56:57.448 --> 56:58.814
What's at the clinic?

56:58.816 --> 56:58.814
My family's there.

56:58.816 --> 57:00.949
We'll go there,
we'll get them,

57:00.951 --> 57:02.151
and then we'll
get out of here.

57:02.153 --> 57:04.186
You too.

57:04.188 --> 57:06.054
Thank you, Roger.

57:06.056 --> 57:07.923
Yeah.

57:07.925 --> 57:09.725
Now let's just try and keep
moving a little bit,

57:09.727 --> 57:11.593
keep our temperature up,
all right?

57:28.111 --> 57:29.445
Huh.

57:29.447 --> 57:32.214
It works.

57:32.216 --> 57:35.451
God, I love science.

57:35.453 --> 57:37.719
Now let's get you in the air.

57:42.559 --> 57:44.726
Are you sure it's safe
to go out there?

57:44.728 --> 57:45.894
The storm
comes and goes,

57:45.896 --> 57:45.894
and each time,

57:45.896 --> 57:49.131
the window between
cold snaps grows shorter,

57:49.133 --> 57:50.199
eventually,

57:50.201 --> 57:51.867
there won't be
anywhere safe to go.

57:51.869 --> 57:51.867
So, what should we do?

57:51.869 --> 57:55.103
We're going to make
like the rusty blackbird.

57:55.105 --> 57:56.205
What?

57:56.207 --> 57:57.706
We're gonna
fly south, all right?

57:57.708 --> 57:59.475
We're gonna go
to the airport,

57:59.477 --> 58:00.576
we're gonna get
a helicopter,

58:00.578 --> 58:01.610
and fly above the winds

58:01.612 --> 58:02.744
till we get to
a warmer spot.

58:02.746 --> 58:04.613
You know how to fly
a helicopter?

58:04.615 --> 58:06.949
Yeah, we're gonna
figure that out.

58:29.772 --> 58:32.140
Come on, call me,
either of you.

58:34.077 --> 58:35.511
Lettie, what
are you doing?

58:35.513 --> 58:37.079
Well, this'll help
keep the heat in

58:37.081 --> 58:38.647
in case the generator goes.

58:43.086 --> 58:44.186
In case somebody
makes it back.

58:45.255 --> 58:47.523
Right.

58:49.159 --> 58:50.959
Roger!

58:52.696 --> 58:54.630
Thank god, you're here.

58:54.632 --> 58:56.632
Oh, I was so
worried about you.

58:56.634 --> 58:58.000
Where's Jordan?

58:58.002 --> 58:59.067
He went
for Claire.

58:59.069 --> 59:00.068
I demanded
that he stay here,

59:00.070 --> 59:01.270
but he didn't listen.

59:01.272 --> 59:03.772
-We're going to get them.
-Then what?

59:03.774 --> 59:04.873
We're going to fly out of here.

59:04.875 --> 59:07.676
The closest runway
is 15 miles away.

59:07.678 --> 59:10.679
And there's a killer
storm hunting us down.

59:10.681 --> 59:10.679
How is that
going to work?

59:10.681 --> 59:13.682
What we need is
a refrigerated truck.

59:13.684 --> 59:14.983
It keeps the cool in, but
it would also keep the cool--

59:14.985 --> 59:16.051
--out.

59:16.053 --> 59:17.219
So, back to the store?

59:17.221 --> 59:18.954
We have one
for deliveries.

59:18.956 --> 59:18.954
Okay, perfect.

59:18.956 --> 59:21.223
You two get the truck,
I'll get Jordan and Claire.

59:21.225 --> 59:22.257
And, lettie,

59:22.259 --> 59:23.625
can you pack up
my medical bag

59:23.627 --> 59:24.826
for when I get back?

59:24.828 --> 59:26.828
I don't think
we should split up.

59:26.830 --> 59:28.697
The b&b isn't a new building.

59:28.699 --> 59:30.299
I have to go get them.

59:30.301 --> 59:32.234
Okay, well, we have
an hour and 24 minutes

59:32.236 --> 59:33.302
until the next blast.

59:33.304 --> 59:34.670
Set your watch.

59:34.672 --> 59:35.704
Okay, we'll meet back here?

59:35.706 --> 59:37.906
If, uh...
If things go wrong...

59:37.908 --> 59:40.042
We meet back here.

59:41.110 --> 59:42.110
I love you.

59:42.112 --> 59:43.912
You too. Go!

01:00:07.003 --> 01:00:08.770
Oh, no.

01:00:14.344 --> 01:00:15.944
Oh, no.

01:00:17.313 --> 01:00:19.715
No...

01:00:22.118 --> 01:00:23.952
Jordy...

01:00:25.021 --> 01:00:26.989
God!

01:00:26.991 --> 01:00:28.023
Mom!

01:00:28.025 --> 01:00:29.157
What are you doing?

01:00:29.159 --> 01:00:30.726
Oh, jordy!

01:00:30.728 --> 01:00:31.960
Don't do that
to a guy.

01:00:32.996 --> 01:00:35.397
Don't you ever do that
to me again, you hear?

01:00:35.399 --> 01:00:37.265
Okay, I hear you.

01:00:37.267 --> 01:00:38.300
I'm so glad
you two are okay.

01:00:38.302 --> 01:00:40.168
He saved my life,
Dr. summers.

01:00:40.170 --> 01:00:40.168
I didn't know.

01:00:40.170 --> 01:00:43.071
I would have gone to bed
and never woken up.

01:00:43.073 --> 01:00:44.239
That's what
families do.

01:00:44.241 --> 01:00:46.108
Now, listen,
we don't have much time.

01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:47.175
We've got to get back.

01:00:47.177 --> 01:00:48.343
Wait, what about dad?

01:00:48.345 --> 01:00:50.178
It's okay.
He's safe.

01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:52.381
Come on.

01:00:57.186 --> 01:00:58.320
Where are you going?

01:00:58.322 --> 01:00:59.955
Northerners,

01:00:59.957 --> 01:01:02.024
we know
all the cold weather tricks.

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:03.852
Now you know.

01:02:03.854 --> 01:02:05.987
You better
do something with it.

01:02:25.408 --> 01:02:26.408
All right,

01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:27.409
let's jump 'er.

01:02:34.217 --> 01:02:35.517
Let's try it.

01:02:35.519 --> 01:02:36.752
Ready?

01:02:42.292 --> 01:02:43.492
Yeah!

01:02:43.494 --> 01:02:44.760
Whoo!

01:02:44.762 --> 01:02:45.961
Okay...

01:02:50.533 --> 01:02:51.500
Piece of cake, huh?

01:02:51.502 --> 01:02:52.868
Yeah, right.

01:03:04.013 --> 01:03:05.247
I found a couple more, lettie.

01:03:05.249 --> 01:03:06.381
Oh, great.

01:03:08.284 --> 01:03:08.283
Did you get the truck?

01:03:08.285 --> 01:03:10.252
Yeah. Did you get
Jordan and Claire?

01:03:10.254 --> 01:03:10.252
I sent them

01:03:10.254 --> 01:03:12.788
to turn the thermostats
and the lights down

01:03:12.790 --> 01:03:13.855
in the rest of the hospital,

01:03:13.857 --> 01:03:13.855
except for this area
right here.

01:03:13.857 --> 01:03:16.358
That generator's been
working for two days.

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:16.358
Makes sense.

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:19.461
<i> The white house</i>
<i> official statement is,</i>

01:03:19.463 --> 01:03:21.062
<i> "we just didn't know."</i>

01:03:21.064 --> 01:03:25.267
<i> But Dr. Tim Hughes knew,</i>
<i> then and now.</i>

01:03:25.269 --> 01:03:25.267
<i> There's been</i>
<i> no further contact with him</i>

01:03:25.269 --> 01:03:29.070
<i> since his life-saving signal</i>
<i> went out to the world</i>

01:03:29.072 --> 01:03:31.940
<i> from a remote region</i>
<i> in northern Alaska.</i>

01:03:31.942 --> 01:03:33.875
<i> Mass evacuations are underway</i>

01:03:33.877 --> 01:03:35.944
<i> everywhere in</i>
<i> the northern hemisphere.</i>

01:03:35.946 --> 01:03:38.280
<i> Airports are fueling</i>
<i> every plane</i>

01:03:38.282 --> 01:03:40.382
<i> to save as many lives</i>
<i> as possible.</i>

01:03:40.384 --> 01:03:42.818
<i> If you own a plane</i>
<i> or have a pilot's license,</i>

01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:44.419
<i> you're asked</i>
<i> to contact authorities</i>

01:03:44.421 --> 01:03:46.488
<i> and make yourself known.</i>

01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:48.490
<i> If you can, get south.</i>

01:03:48.492 --> 01:03:50.258
<i> If you can't, get indoors.</i>

01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:53.128
<i> New buildings</i>
<i>with new insulation are better.</i>

01:03:53.130 --> 01:03:55.197
<i> Do whatever it takes</i>
<i> to stay warm,</i>

01:03:55.199 --> 01:03:55.197
<i> and wait it out.</i>

01:03:55.199 --> 01:03:58.967
<i> Now, emergency relief actions</i>
<i> are already planned</i>

01:03:58.969 --> 01:04:01.269
<i> for when the storm</i>
<i> has blown itself out</i>

01:04:01.271 --> 01:04:02.838
<i> in seven days.</i>

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:04.506
He did it.

01:04:04.508 --> 01:04:05.574
Was that you?

01:04:05.576 --> 01:04:08.076
No, that was
Dr. Tim Hughes.

01:04:09.045 --> 01:04:11.012
Dad!

01:04:11.014 --> 01:04:12.247
Jordy!

01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:14.916
You made it, man!

01:04:15.585 --> 01:04:17.185
I'm sorry I made you
come up here.

01:04:17.187 --> 01:04:19.521
No, I'm sorry about
being a jerk about cabo.

01:04:19.523 --> 01:04:19.521
It doesn't matter.

01:04:19.523 --> 01:04:22.357
It was my fault, I've got
to take responsibility.

01:04:23.459 --> 01:04:23.458
It just doesn't matter.

01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:26.228
<i> The most</i>
<i> important thing to remember</i>

01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:26.228
<i> is to stay warm.</i>

01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:28.330
All right, we've got
seven minutes.

01:04:28.332 --> 01:04:29.898
Everybody hunker down.

01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:31.199
<i> ...stay calm.</i>

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:33.535
<i> Okay, it's time.</i>

01:04:33.537 --> 01:04:36.538
<i> Get inside, get a fire going.</i>

01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:38.306
<i> Godspeed, everyone,</i>

01:04:38.308 --> 01:04:39.541
<i> and good luck.</i>

01:05:18.014 --> 01:05:19.648
Temperatures are stabilizing.

01:05:19.650 --> 01:05:21.016
Let's go.

01:05:32.261 --> 01:05:33.295
Lettie?

01:05:33.297 --> 01:05:35.563
What are you doing?

01:05:35.565 --> 01:05:36.932
I'm not coming, Candace.

01:05:36.934 --> 01:05:39.067
You can't stay here!

01:05:40.102 --> 01:05:41.436
I was born here, Candace.

01:05:41.438 --> 01:05:43.405
The people I love live here.

01:05:43.407 --> 01:05:45.607
If people need help,
this is where they'll come,

01:05:45.609 --> 01:05:47.008
and I won't abandon them.

01:05:47.010 --> 01:05:48.310
No...

01:05:48.312 --> 01:05:50.979
Lettie, please.

01:05:50.981 --> 01:05:53.481
You can't.

01:06:00.256 --> 01:06:01.690
She's staying!

01:06:01.692 --> 01:06:03.058
Come on, hon'.

01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:04.559
There's nothing
we can do.

01:06:09.967 --> 01:06:11.499
Come on.

01:06:29.452 --> 01:06:30.986
Easy, Roger.

01:06:30.988 --> 01:06:32.087
Slow and steady
keeps us on the road

01:06:32.089 --> 01:06:33.088
when it comes to
cold driving.

01:06:33.090 --> 01:06:34.189
Slow and steady

01:06:34.191 --> 01:06:37.058
will have us
dead on the road.

01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:38.259
How long to the airport?

01:06:38.261 --> 01:06:40.261
Normally, it takes
20 minutes.

01:06:40.263 --> 01:06:42.397
Normally.

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:45.333
What is that up ahead?

01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:52.674
Oh...

01:06:52.676 --> 01:06:54.576
That doesn't look good.

01:06:58.581 --> 01:06:59.581
Why are we stopping?

01:06:59.583 --> 01:07:01.416
I don't know.

01:07:08.224 --> 01:07:10.091
Hey! Is everything okay?

01:07:10.093 --> 01:07:12.227
It's fine! Stay put.

01:07:26.142 --> 01:07:28.276
Are they are all...

01:07:30.346 --> 01:07:31.446
Yeah.

01:07:36.786 --> 01:07:38.253
Is this, uh...

01:07:38.255 --> 01:07:39.687
Is this the only way
to the airport?

01:07:39.689 --> 01:07:42.123
Yes.

01:07:42.125 --> 01:07:43.291
There's no other
way through.

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:51.766
Are we going to
tell them about this?

01:07:51.768 --> 01:07:54.302
Not if we
don't have to.

01:07:54.304 --> 01:07:55.403
Hey, why aren't
we moving?

01:07:55.405 --> 01:07:56.404
Oh, my god,

01:07:56.406 --> 01:07:58.673
what happened?

01:07:58.675 --> 01:08:01.076
Come on.

01:08:01.078 --> 01:08:02.210
Is something wrong?

01:08:02.212 --> 01:08:02.210
The road up ahead
is blocked.

01:08:02.212 --> 01:08:05.513
Well, what do we...
What do we do now?

01:08:06.616 --> 01:08:08.650
We get in the Van.
Come on.

01:08:16.358 --> 01:08:19.327
Let's hope we're
right about this.

01:08:37.412 --> 01:08:39.747
It's working.

01:08:40.816 --> 01:08:42.850
This is colder
than I anticipated.

01:08:42.853 --> 01:08:44.252
We're only going to
be able to stand

01:08:44.254 --> 01:08:45.886
one or two more of these
inside here.

01:08:45.889 --> 01:08:48.723
I need to call
my parents.

01:08:48.725 --> 01:08:51.126
Tell them
what's happening.

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:53.461
Cell phone service
will be down by now.

01:08:54.462 --> 01:08:54.462
We'll find them

01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:57.698
when this is
all over, okay?

01:08:57.701 --> 01:09:00.502
What are we
going to do now?

01:09:00.504 --> 01:09:01.603
There isn't another way,
is there?

01:09:02.872 --> 01:09:04.538
Not without going back to town.

01:09:04.541 --> 01:09:05.540
No...

01:09:05.542 --> 01:09:07.742
I know a shortcut.

01:09:07.743 --> 01:09:09.377
What's that?

01:09:09.379 --> 01:09:12.279
We could take
white bridge.

01:09:12.282 --> 01:09:12.279
No.

01:09:12.282 --> 01:09:15.817
Wait... what's
white bridge?

01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:17.152
It's the old direct.

01:09:17.154 --> 01:09:18.286
It crosses the river

01:09:18.287 --> 01:09:19.487
and goes straight
to the airport.

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:21.221
Well, that's perfect,
let's do that.

01:09:21.224 --> 01:09:22.890
It's condemned.

01:09:22.893 --> 01:09:24.591
Parts of the foundation
are cracked.

01:09:24.594 --> 01:09:27.328
Damaged by ice.

01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:29.764
Last year,
two kids died

01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:32.500
crossing over
on quads.

01:09:32.502 --> 01:09:34.469
Oh, my god...

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:36.270
Not perfect.

01:09:36.273 --> 01:09:37.939
It's not an option.

01:09:37.941 --> 01:09:40.841
They were
chasing the edge.

01:09:40.844 --> 01:09:42.377
What does
that mean?

01:09:42.379 --> 01:09:44.845
It's stupid,
it's like a dare.

01:09:44.848 --> 01:09:45.880
The boys will see

01:09:45.881 --> 01:09:47.615
who can ride
closest to the edge

01:09:47.617 --> 01:09:48.850
where its falling apart.

01:09:48.852 --> 01:09:50.318
If it won't
hold a quad,

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:51.920
it won't hold us.

01:09:51.921 --> 01:09:53.921
It will, though.

01:09:53.924 --> 01:09:55.190
I've done it.

01:09:55.192 --> 01:09:56.558
With my brother,

01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:58.326
we've driven across
in his truck

01:09:58.328 --> 01:10:00.895
when we were driving
back from a party once.

01:10:00.897 --> 01:10:02.964
No, this
sounds too risky.

01:10:02.966 --> 01:10:05.433
It would get us
to the airport.

01:10:05.435 --> 01:10:09.270
And the road itself,
it isn't that bad.

01:10:09.272 --> 01:10:10.872
Well, we're
all dead

01:10:10.874 --> 01:10:14.309
if we stay
here anyway.

01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:22.850
I don't know that
we have another option.

01:10:25.421 --> 01:10:26.854
Let's go.

01:11:15.271 --> 01:11:16.337
You've got to be kidding me.

01:11:16.339 --> 01:11:18.006
-What?
-Gas.

01:11:19.709 --> 01:11:21.442
You felt it back there.

01:11:21.444 --> 01:11:22.410
That air conditioner
was the only thing

01:11:22.412 --> 01:11:22.410
that kept us alive.

01:11:22.412 --> 01:11:24.979
All right, how long
is it going to take us

01:11:24.981 --> 01:11:25.980
to get to the airport

01:11:25.982 --> 01:11:27.448
once we cross the bridge?

01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:29.550
Windy roads, but 40 minutes?

01:11:29.552 --> 01:11:30.985
All right, and then we need
another half an hour

01:11:30.987 --> 01:11:32.020
with the engine running

01:11:32.022 --> 01:11:33.354
once the storm comes.

01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:36.291
We're not going to have
enough gas

01:11:36.293 --> 01:11:38.493
to keep the engine running
during the next blast.

01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:41.029
It's 40 minutes by truck.

01:11:41.031 --> 01:11:42.297
On foot?

01:11:42.299 --> 01:11:44.899
We can't make it.

01:11:47.703 --> 01:11:50.505
We're not gonna make it.

01:11:53.375 --> 01:11:54.742
Yes, we will.

01:11:56.445 --> 01:11:58.880
I'm going to drive
through the next cold blast.

01:11:58.882 --> 01:12:00.882
No, you're not.

01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:03.518
It's the only way.

01:12:04.453 --> 01:12:06.521
You are the only one
who can fly a helicopter.

01:12:07.523 --> 01:12:09.991
There's no way I'm letting
a mother or children

01:12:09.993 --> 01:12:11.092
do this.

01:12:11.094 --> 01:12:12.593
Fiona...

01:12:12.595 --> 01:12:15.396
That's what we do
in the north, Roger.

01:12:15.398 --> 01:12:18.032
We look out for each other,
and we sacrifice.

01:12:22.004 --> 01:12:24.939
No.

01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:29.911
You know
how this is going to end,

01:12:29.913 --> 01:12:31.813
so let's stop wasting time.

01:12:31.815 --> 01:12:34.015
You need to stop this truck,

01:12:34.017 --> 01:12:35.583
and get in the back.

01:12:41.090 --> 01:12:43.591
We'll, uh...

01:12:43.593 --> 01:12:45.126
We'll winterize you
as best we can.

01:12:45.128 --> 01:12:46.361
Put candles in here,

01:12:46.363 --> 01:12:49.630
and we'll
crank the heat.

01:12:49.632 --> 01:12:53.134
Then maybe you'll have a chance.

01:12:53.136 --> 01:12:55.570
Let's stop wasting time.

01:13:02.111 --> 01:13:03.778
-Give me some blankets.
-Why?

01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:04.912
Come on, just give me
some blankets.

01:13:04.914 --> 01:13:05.913
I haven't
got time here.

01:13:05.915 --> 01:13:06.948
Roger, what's going on?

01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:07.949
I'll be right back.

01:13:07.951 --> 01:13:09.951
It's okay, all right?

01:13:31.073 --> 01:13:33.875
Thank you, Fiona.

01:13:34.977 --> 01:13:36.711
I'll see you at the airport.

01:13:38.981 --> 01:13:41.649
It was a good town, Roger.

01:13:41.651 --> 01:13:43.951
The best.

01:13:47.656 --> 01:13:49.023
Get going.

01:14:07.443 --> 01:14:09.110
Dad, what's going on?

01:14:09.112 --> 01:14:10.978
Sit down.

01:14:13.715 --> 01:14:17.218
We don't have enough gas
to stop and make it there,

01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:19.053
so Fiona is going drive
through the next blast.

01:14:19.055 --> 01:14:20.121
What?

01:14:20.123 --> 01:14:22.023
No, she'll
freeze!

01:14:22.025 --> 01:14:23.124
No, listen, we've
winterized the cab

01:14:23.126 --> 01:14:24.525
as best as we can.

01:14:25.494 --> 01:14:26.794
There's a chance
that she'll make it.

01:14:26.796 --> 01:14:29.130
Dad, man,
we can't do this.

01:14:29.132 --> 01:14:32.467
Well, if we don't,
we'll all freeze.

01:14:32.469 --> 01:14:34.702
And if she freezes
and drives off the road?

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:38.940
That's not
going to happen.

01:15:07.936 --> 01:15:11.038
Hey, you okay?

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:13.508
I'm just so sick
of this.

01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:16.944
God, I know.
Me too.

01:15:16.946 --> 01:15:19.680
You know, you should
probably eat something.

01:15:19.682 --> 01:15:22.850
Calories equals energy,
and energy equals heat.

01:15:23.919 --> 01:15:25.119
I'm fine, Miami.

01:15:27.256 --> 01:15:31.259
Did you mean
what you said?

01:15:31.261 --> 01:15:34.095
About finding
my parents?

01:15:34.097 --> 01:15:36.597
Absolutely.

01:15:57.753 --> 01:16:00.888
Okay, we've got seven minutes
until the next blast.

01:16:58.080 --> 01:16:59.981
We must be
on the bridge.

01:16:59.983 --> 01:17:02.817
It will hold.

01:17:04.152 --> 01:17:05.286
Oh, god...

01:17:05.288 --> 01:17:06.687
It's all right.

01:18:15.023 --> 01:18:17.358
Almost there...

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:18.859
Almost there.

01:18:19.928 --> 01:18:21.962
We're going to be okay.

01:18:31.873 --> 01:18:34.275
-We've stopped.
-Yeah.

01:18:34.277 --> 01:18:35.309
We've gotta go out
and get her.

01:18:35.311 --> 01:18:36.243
No, we can't
go out and get her.

01:18:36.245 --> 01:18:36.243
It's too cold.

01:18:36.245 --> 01:18:38.245
You won't make it to
the front of the truck.

01:18:38.247 --> 01:18:39.313
Fiona--

01:18:39.315 --> 01:18:40.981
-i understand that.
-Dad--

01:18:40.983 --> 01:18:42.316
there's nothing
we can do, jordy.

01:18:46.154 --> 01:18:47.388
I'm sorry.

01:18:58.867 --> 01:18:59.934
All right,
that's it.

01:18:59.936 --> 01:19:01.302
We haven't got
much time, let's go.

01:19:05.307 --> 01:19:06.941
Fiona?

01:19:17.219 --> 01:19:20.354
I'm so sorry.

01:19:23.258 --> 01:19:25.025
Good people.

01:19:30.832 --> 01:19:32.867
Come on.
Let's go.

01:19:45.447 --> 01:19:46.814
What now?

01:19:46.816 --> 01:19:48.048
The two of you,

01:19:48.050 --> 01:19:49.350
find the office
and find the keys.

01:19:49.352 --> 01:19:50.551
-On it.
-It should be obvious.

01:19:50.553 --> 01:19:52.419
Come on, Miami.

01:19:52.421 --> 01:19:53.788
Roger...

01:19:53.790 --> 01:19:54.989
All we need to do
is get to 8,000 feet,

01:19:54.991 --> 01:19:56.123
and we'll be fine, okay?

01:19:57.459 --> 01:19:58.492
I love you.

01:19:58.494 --> 01:20:00.027
I love you.

01:20:00.029 --> 01:20:02.863
Come on. Let's get
this bird out of here.

01:20:12.274 --> 01:20:14.208
Can I tell you something?

01:20:14.210 --> 01:20:15.342
Yeah, sure.

01:20:19.481 --> 01:20:20.548
I'm actually...

01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:23.818
Pretty freaked out right now.

01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:26.053
I know.

01:20:26.055 --> 01:20:28.889
I am too.

01:20:30.892 --> 01:20:33.894
It's going to be okay.

01:20:41.603 --> 01:20:42.903
Are you...

01:20:42.905 --> 01:20:44.205
Really scared?

01:20:45.307 --> 01:20:46.841
Well, I'm pretty sure

01:20:46.843 --> 01:20:50.144
my dad's never flown
a helicopter before, so...

01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:00.921
There must be
a better way than this.

01:21:00.923 --> 01:21:03.557
Well, we don't have
anything to tow it with.

01:21:03.559 --> 01:21:04.525
We've just got to
clear the doors.

01:21:05.527 --> 01:21:06.560
We got the keys!

01:21:06.562 --> 01:21:07.528
Okay, good.
Give us a hand here.

01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:09.230
Jordy, here.

01:21:12.201 --> 01:21:13.100
Already?

01:21:13.102 --> 01:21:15.436
I'm sick of that alarm.

01:21:16.404 --> 01:21:18.205
All right, everybody in.
We're running out of time.

01:21:18.207 --> 01:21:19.340
Come on.

01:21:20.375 --> 01:21:22.009
Inside, go!

01:21:33.021 --> 01:21:35.522
Hit the heat,
it's under the vent there.

01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:40.461
Dad, I had no idea

01:21:40.463 --> 01:21:42.529
you knew how to
fly a helicopter.

01:21:58.346 --> 01:21:59.914
Claire's right.

01:21:59.916 --> 01:22:02.016
You're kind of cool.

01:22:02.018 --> 01:22:04.218
I'm full of surprises.

01:22:43.591 --> 01:22:45.726
Dad, we're icing up.

01:22:45.728 --> 01:22:47.061
Just watch the altimeter.

01:22:47.063 --> 01:22:47.061
When we get to 8,000 feet,

01:22:47.063 --> 01:22:50.297
we'll be above the arctic blast,
and it will stop.

01:22:51.333 --> 01:22:52.633
We can make it.

01:22:52.635 --> 01:22:53.634
Yeah, we can.

01:22:58.406 --> 01:23:00.307
Okay, we're still rising.
We're close.

01:23:01.509 --> 01:23:03.444
Almost there.

01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:10.684
-We did it!
-Whoo!

01:23:10.686 --> 01:23:12.119
Are we safe?

01:23:12.121 --> 01:23:13.220
We're clear,
we're gonna be okay.

01:23:13.222 --> 01:23:14.421
Yeah, we're gonna
be all right.

01:23:14.423 --> 01:23:16.223
We'll just have to
touch down to refuel,

01:23:16.225 --> 01:23:18.659
but we have
a radio now.

01:23:18.661 --> 01:23:20.260
We can get information.

01:23:20.262 --> 01:23:22.129
We'll just continue
further south.

01:23:23.765 --> 01:23:25.132
Nice flying, dad.

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:39.713
We can't keep touching down

01:23:39.715 --> 01:23:41.415
for gas and food, Roger.

01:23:41.417 --> 01:23:41.415
What are we going to do?

01:23:41.417 --> 01:23:45.686
What do you expect, mom?
It's an ice age.

01:23:45.688 --> 01:23:47.021
Roger...

01:23:47.023 --> 01:23:50.024
We'll find
Claire's parents,

01:23:50.026 --> 01:23:53.093
and we'll
start over again.

01:23:54.129 --> 01:23:57.164
Rebuild our communities.

01:23:57.166 --> 01:24:00.534
Try not to make the same
mistakes we made last time.

01:24:03.371 --> 01:24:05.072
For Tim

01:24:05.074 --> 01:24:07.207
and Fiona...

01:24:07.209 --> 01:24:09.309
And all those people
that didn't make it.
