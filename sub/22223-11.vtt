WEBVTT

00:01.294 --> 00:02.750
Previously on Farscape.

00:02.837 --> 00:05.203
I am Pathfinder Neeyala.

00:05.298 --> 00:06.708
Aeryn:
Wormhole technology.

00:06.799 --> 00:08.585
Garnered at great cost.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.758
With potential beyond measure.

00:10.845 --> 00:13.587
Moya was sucked down a wormhole
and spat out again.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.137
What happened in the middle?

00:15.224 --> 00:17.465
Pilot:
We were not harmed,
merely... examined.

00:17.560 --> 00:19.767
By who? Neeyala's
Pathfinder buddies?

00:19.854 --> 00:22.311
I... couldn't say.

00:22.982 --> 00:27.271
Tres, dos, uno.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.897
I've finally figured
out wormholes.

00:28.988 --> 00:32.071
Rygel:
You did it? All that wormhole
nonsense we put up with.

00:32.158 --> 00:34.069
Yeah, I can get you home.

00:34.160 --> 00:37.323
If I knew where home was
or where we are.

00:39.457 --> 00:42.324
And now, on Farscape.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.354
Exist...

01:07.777 --> 01:10.063
Exist... ence.

01:10.154 --> 01:11.940
Existence.

01:12.031 --> 01:14.317
Existence. Existen...

01:14.408 --> 01:16.148
...eal.

01:16.244 --> 01:20.578
Exist-en si al.

01:20.665 --> 01:22.201
How's the English?

01:22.291 --> 01:23.906
Oh.

01:24.001 --> 01:27.038
They start small, they grow,
and then they change.

01:27.129 --> 01:30.337
I don't know. 26 symbols.
It should be easy.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.631
Well, they can barely escape
their own gravity.

01:32.718 --> 01:35.050
(laughing)

01:38.849 --> 01:40.885
He's been out there a long time.

01:40.977 --> 01:42.467
Hmm?

01:42.561 --> 01:46.270
Oh, yeah, he seems to like
this particular wormhole
for some reason.

01:46.357 --> 01:50.600
Hmm. He's just learned to speak
the language of wormhole.

01:50.695 --> 01:52.151
Worm-hole.

01:52.238 --> 01:54.445
Wormhole.

01:54.532 --> 01:59.526
If you wanna get him back,
that's not the language
you need to learn.

02:02.373 --> 02:04.284
D'Argo:
John, are you there?
We're on secure Comms.

02:04.375 --> 02:05.660
Is there a problem?

02:05.751 --> 02:09.118
| just caught this apothecary
placing drugs in your quarters.

02:09.213 --> 02:11.670
She says they help you
forget Aeryn.

02:11.757 --> 02:13.497
Theyjust dull the pain.

02:14.510 --> 02:16.341
Do they work?

02:22.226 --> 02:24.137
How much perspective
have you lost?

02:24.228 --> 02:28.141
You know that if you take
anything this witch gives you,
you halve the dose.

02:28.232 --> 02:32.100
D'Argo, it ain't none of your
business, so forget about it.

02:32.194 --> 02:34.526
I could make something that
will help you remember.

02:34.613 --> 02:38.105
Oh! Soulless Luxan!

02:38.200 --> 02:40.031
John.

02:40.119 --> 02:42.405
Oh John, you have to let her go.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.746
It's more complicated than that.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.247
Crichton out.

02:54.967 --> 02:56.173
(crunching)

02:56.260 --> 02:57.796
(grunting)

02:57.887 --> 03:01.220
Ahl How is Moya doing?

03:01.307 --> 03:06.347
Much better now that her new
filters are blocking this
region's electrostatic surges.

03:06.437 --> 03:11.682
Excellent. Next thing you
have to do is get over
your fear of wormholes.

03:11.776 --> 03:13.892
Defying all logic,
Crichton may actually

03:13.986 --> 03:17.444
figure out how to get us away
from the Peacekeepers forever.

03:17.531 --> 03:23.401
Without disrespect, he
oftentimes leaps to conclusions
prior to leading us...

03:23.496 --> 03:26.112
Not here, Pilot. Trust me.

03:26.207 --> 03:27.617
lwouldn't have risen to Dominar

03:27.708 --> 03:30.450
if I wasn't good at recognizing
things before they happen.

03:30.544 --> 03:35.038
You were deposed in a coup
led by your own cousin.

03:35.132 --> 03:39.341
Hmm. Just be ready.

03:39.428 --> 03:43.171
None of them seem to take your
warnings very seriously.

03:43.265 --> 03:44.766
Why should they?

03:44.850 --> 03:49.514
They have only anecdotal
evidence of what the
Scarrans intend.

03:53.859 --> 03:56.145
Unlike you and l.

04:02.326 --> 04:07.195
Should I accept your proposal,
to be allies,

04:07.289 --> 04:11.373
what assurances do l have that
you will watch my back?

04:11.460 --> 04:15.248
Apart from the pleasantness
of the task,

04:18.217 --> 04:23.712
you instantly become the most
important one to me.

04:25.433 --> 04:29.142
Most important, save Crichton.

04:29.228 --> 04:31.594
Always save Crichton.

04:35.234 --> 04:37.225
Agreed.

04:38.279 --> 04:43.899
Three, two, one...

04:43.993 --> 04:46.951
(rumbling)

04:50.374 --> 04:52.330
(chuckling)

04:52.418 --> 04:55.251
Ain't you a beautiful thing?

04:56.380 --> 04:58.541
Damn, check this puppy out.

05:02.052 --> 05:05.965
Hey, Pilot, about time for
that pickup, I think.

05:06.056 --> 05:08.342
John?
-Break out the docking web
anytime now.

05:08.434 --> 05:09.344
Pilot?

05:10.269 --> 05:11.600
Pilot?

05:14.023 --> 05:15.513
Pilot!

05:15.608 --> 05:17.098
D'Argo, you might wanna
get the ship...

05:17.193 --> 05:19.900
Pilot!

05:25.659 --> 05:26.944
...ready.

05:34.084 --> 05:37.247
(yelling)

05:42.760 --> 05:46.673
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

05:46.764 --> 05:50.256
Three years ago I got shot
through a wormhole.

05:50.351 --> 05:52.137
I'm in a distant part
of the universe

05:52.228 --> 05:55.470
aboard this living ship of
escaped prisoners,

05:55.564 --> 05:57.304
my friends.

05:58.359 --> 06:00.145
I've made enemies.

06:00.236 --> 06:03.399
Powerful, dangerous.

06:03.489 --> 06:07.232
Now all I want is to
find a way home

06:07.326 --> 06:10.068
to warn Earth.

06:10.162 --> 06:15.247
Look upward and share
the wonders I've seen.

06:50.327 --> 06:53.444
Kansas, in the winter.

06:53.539 --> 06:55.655
(groaning)

06:57.334 --> 06:59.074
D'Argo.

06:59.169 --> 07:01.080
Pilot.

07:01.171 --> 07:05.505
Oh, hell, I'm getting that
"going to the Island of
Misfit Toys" thing.

07:05.593 --> 07:08.005
Orjust waiting on the Titanic.

07:08.095 --> 07:13.260
Well, as long as this whole
deal doesn't end up with
me as an old man.

07:14.602 --> 07:16.968
Hello!

07:17.730 --> 07:20.187
Nanook? Beelzebub?

07:20.274 --> 07:21.514
(swirling whoosh )

07:21.609 --> 07:26.353
Yeah, let's get it on,
get it over with.

07:36.707 --> 07:38.948
Nice threads.

07:39.043 --> 07:41.329
Helps to humanize you.

07:41.420 --> 07:44.457
Makes it easier for me to
sympathize with your problems.

07:45.674 --> 07:47.289
Time.

07:49.553 --> 07:50.417
Time.

07:50.512 --> 07:51.763
Zup?

07:52.473 --> 07:53.428
Time.

07:53.515 --> 07:54.766
Flies.

07:54.850 --> 07:55.714
Time.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.390
Bandits.
-Time.

07:57.478 --> 07:59.389
Wounds all heal.
-Time.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.687
Rosemary and thyme...
-Time.

08:01.774 --> 08:03.389
zup.

08:06.904 --> 08:09.395
Time.

08:09.490 --> 08:13.199
Either stop pointing guns at
people or get a bigger gun.

08:16.038 --> 08:18.495
Time is...

08:21.627 --> 08:23.413
Infinite.

08:24.797 --> 08:26.412
Relative.

08:29.385 --> 08:33.094
You are quite a simple organism
to possess the knowledge you do.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.637
You're only saying that 'cause
you don't know me.

08:36.934 --> 08:41.223
Time is meaningless, and yet
it is all that exists.

08:41.313 --> 08:43.224
Very Morrissey.

08:43.315 --> 08:45.306
My name is Joh...
-Yes.

08:45.401 --> 08:47.733
And yours is...
-Unimportant to our encounter.

08:47.820 --> 08:50.152
(chuckling):
Exactly.

08:50.239 --> 08:53.948
I love how you lay it
out there, Einstein.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.695
So let me ask you.

08:55.786 --> 09:00.621
Without getting existential
on me, why am I...
why are we... here?

09:00.708 --> 09:02.289
You are present to perish.

09:02.376 --> 09:05.243
I am present to effect
that outcome.

09:05.337 --> 09:11.253
(voices speaking
alien languages)

09:11.343 --> 09:14.005
(explosions)

09:15.013 --> 09:16.753
Oh, my God.

09:21.103 --> 09:22.468
Day one.

09:25.566 --> 09:27.056
( squeaking )

09:30.154 --> 09:32.110
How y'all doing?

09:33.073 --> 09:34.188
My name's John.

09:34.283 --> 09:35.864
John Cri...

09:35.951 --> 09:38.067
(speaking Luxan )

09:38.162 --> 09:41.199
Have to wait for the
translator microbes, buddy.

09:41.290 --> 09:43.155
(alien words become):
...answer him quickly.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.866
You know how Luxans can be.
-Oh, you betcha.

09:45.961 --> 09:48.794
Your ship. What kind is it?

09:48.881 --> 09:50.997
It's a... four cylinder.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.173
Got a plastic Jesus
on the dashboard.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.500
(explosions thundering )

09:55.637 --> 09:57.423
Whoa!

09:57.514 --> 10:00.301
Pilot! I demand you give me
maneuverability, now!

10:00.392 --> 10:01.973
Pilot:
There is nothing I can do.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.925
Not while the control collar
is still in place.

10:04.021 --> 10:07.184
Hey, why don't you try
ripping out that control panel?

10:07.274 --> 10:10.311
Pilot:
Moya can't withstand this
assault much longer!

10:11.987 --> 10:13.852
Here's Rygel!

10:13.947 --> 10:15.938
Hey, Sparky!

10:16.033 --> 10:18.615
They brought you on board,
didn't they?

10:18.702 --> 10:20.112
Don't worry, I'll protect you.

10:20.204 --> 10:23.241
I'll look after you now.
You look after me later.

10:23.332 --> 10:25.698
No offense, Buckwheat, but you
couldn't look after a Chia Pet.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.579
(snorts and spits)

10:27.669 --> 10:29.580
Why don't we move this along.

10:29.671 --> 10:33.163
What is the matter
with you people?!

10:33.258 --> 10:34.418
Tongue.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.219
Thank you.

10:37.888 --> 10:40.049
Thanks for the memories.

10:48.524 --> 10:50.139
Where's the rest of my suit?

10:50.234 --> 10:52.566
This atmosphere will
sustain you.

10:54.488 --> 10:56.479
Space and time are fused.

10:56.573 --> 11:00.862
A set of coordinates for
each required to locate
a specific event.

11:00.953 --> 11:05.322
Everything happens at
a time, in a place.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.869
Relativity.

11:07.960 --> 11:14.172
Movement at speed through space
becomes movement through time.

11:14.258 --> 11:17.295
Einstein again. 1905.
You publish anything since?

11:17.386 --> 11:23.256
Wormholes bridge space-time,
creating a unique ability
to navigate.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.090
Yeah, wormholes.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.641
Been there, done that.

11:26.728 --> 11:28.309
Many times, it seems.

11:28.397 --> 11:34.108
And now, you unerringly position
yourself prior to them opening.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.526
How do you possess
such knowledge?

11:36.613 --> 11:38.319
Bad luck.

11:39.408 --> 11:41.990
Really bad luck.

11:42.077 --> 11:43.578
It's a long story. Maybe later.

11:43.662 --> 11:47.905
Jack:
The unconscious knowledge we've
given you will guide you.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.740
No!
( screaming )

11:49.835 --> 11:51.917
Jack:
You were already on
the right path.

11:52.004 --> 11:54.165
Get out of my head!

11:54.256 --> 11:55.462
Time.

11:56.842 --> 11:58.298
Ancients?

11:59.386 --> 12:01.217
Yeah.

12:01.305 --> 12:05.799
I never met another man who
was more in touch with
his own feelings.

12:05.893 --> 12:07.929
Teacheh
A real hell-raiser.

12:08.020 --> 12:09.476
And you couldn't help
but love him.

12:09.563 --> 12:12.396
Kind of man who would finish
a game with a broken leg.

12:12.482 --> 12:16.976
Rescued me from out of nowhere
and dropped me right in the
middle of my dream job,

12:17.070 --> 12:18.185
working on the Farscape Project.

12:18.280 --> 12:20.191
Woman:
Stephen Hawking is a genius,
all right?

12:20.282 --> 12:25.993
But John is... more toward that
end of the spectrum than
the rest of us.

12:26.079 --> 12:29.037
He would share whatever
he had with others.

12:29.124 --> 12:31.160
I can't bear to be without him.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.161
Sorry.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.413
Oh, and he was so good in bed.

12:34.963 --> 12:37.295
(chuckling)

12:38.842 --> 12:41.549
Wormholes are the one feature
that traverse both our realms,

12:41.637 --> 12:44.720
which adjoin, though
never intersect.

12:44.806 --> 12:47.297
An aggressive perforation of one
would allow an unacceptable

12:47.392 --> 12:51.852
incursion of material from
your existence into ours.

12:51.939 --> 12:53.600
And who would wanna do that?

12:53.690 --> 12:56.477
The biologics of your realm
are infinitely more
aggressive than ours.

12:56.568 --> 12:59.856
Perhaps. Why don't we table
that discussion?

12:59.947 --> 13:01.812
Tell me about the Ancients.

13:01.907 --> 13:06.867
Members of my species,
substantially modified to
live in your realm.

13:09.081 --> 13:12.118
They're here to spy on us?
Narcs?

13:12.209 --> 13:15.042
To catalogue, report
andinﬂuence.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.164
When they disappeared,
we decided to investigate

13:17.255 --> 13:19.632
the state of wormhole
knowledge in your realm.

13:19.716 --> 13:21.126
(whooshing )

13:23.637 --> 13:25.252
(engine laboring)

13:25.347 --> 13:28.214
You hauled Moya's ass
down a wormhole.

13:28.308 --> 13:31.141
I was surprised to
discover a Leviathan.

13:31.228 --> 13:33.844
The expectation was a
Pathfinder vessel.

13:33.939 --> 13:38.979
Neeyala:
I have just infused our beacon
into the Leviathan superstructure.

13:39.069 --> 13:42.027
Those I questioned knew
nothing of wormholes.

13:42.114 --> 13:45.277
They did, however, mention
you repeatedly.

13:45.367 --> 13:48.154
He knows. Crichton knows...

13:48.245 --> 13:52.329
Wormholes are his obsession.

13:53.834 --> 13:55.540
You set them free to find me.

13:55.627 --> 13:58.414
Your knowledge is is quiet
extraordinary for one
of your realm.

13:58.505 --> 13:59.790
Thanks.

13:59.881 --> 14:02.873
And your many travels inside
wormholes, troubling.

14:02.968 --> 14:04.799
But now that I've glimpsed
your mind.

14:04.886 --> 14:08.845
I'm aware this has made you
a target of more
aggressive species.

14:08.932 --> 14:11.799
A liability which must
be dealt with.

14:11.893 --> 14:13.349
You stay the hell away from me.

14:14.312 --> 14:15.597
(whooshing )

14:15.689 --> 14:17.429
( startled grunt)

14:19.818 --> 14:21.979
D'Argo? Pilot?

14:22.070 --> 14:23.731
Chiana:
Crichton...
-Aeryn?

14:23.822 --> 14:25.232
Pip... Aeryn.

14:25.323 --> 14:26.312
It's you.

14:26.408 --> 14:27.193
( explosion )

14:27.284 --> 14:29.616
Ah, what the hell's
going on here?

14:29.703 --> 14:31.239
Frelled. Right up the ass.

14:31.329 --> 14:33.320
It's a great plan you
came up with.

14:33.415 --> 14:35.155
What about the others?

14:35.250 --> 14:37.366
Dead. Sheyangs got 'em.

14:37.461 --> 14:39.247
We're the only ones left.

14:39.337 --> 14:41.328
This is not funny!
We're done here!

14:41.423 --> 14:43.414
We're done, all right.
Everything's gone and
we're next.

14:43.508 --> 14:45.760
(sighing ):
Okay, if we're gonna do this...

14:45.844 --> 14:48.005
What about the Pods, my module?

14:48.096 --> 14:50.178
(whimpering)

14:50.265 --> 14:51.471
Maintenance Bay.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.595
It's, uh, it's a furnace.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.260
Space suits?

14:57.355 --> 15:01.268
This floor is the only one that
isn't filled with toxic dren.

15:01.359 --> 15:03.270
( grunts )
(gasps )

15:07.282 --> 15:08.362
Oh, ho!

15:08.450 --> 15:10.111
Oh, come on, just once.

15:10.202 --> 15:13.444
You and me, like we should have
from the very beginning.

15:13.538 --> 15:15.199
Pip, knock it off.
Let's just get out of here.

15:15.290 --> 15:16.655
( explosion )
(gasps )

15:16.750 --> 15:18.706
Come on, Crichton.
We're gonna die.

15:18.794 --> 15:22.207
I just wanna die doing something
fun. Something I like.

15:22.297 --> 15:23.582
Something that makes me feel...

15:23.673 --> 15:25.504
(laughs)
good.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.924
Your plan didn't work.

15:28.011 --> 15:30.218
This is mine.

15:30.305 --> 15:31.169
No!

15:31.264 --> 15:32.128
(whooshing )

15:32.224 --> 15:33.680
(grunts)

15:34.726 --> 15:36.637
Spectacular.

15:36.728 --> 15:39.435
Boy, I gotta hand it to you. You
give great... great illusion.

15:39.523 --> 15:43.141
Now I know how Copperfield
got Schiffer.

15:43.235 --> 15:45.567
What you experienced was real.

15:45.654 --> 15:48.191
Well, it felt real.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.987
Real.

15:50.075 --> 15:51.485
Real like the water's not wet?

15:51.576 --> 15:53.953
Real like you see with no eyes?

16:00.961 --> 16:03.043
No!

16:05.173 --> 16:06.913
Time.

16:07.008 --> 16:09.624
Wormholes.

16:09.719 --> 16:12.381
The knowledge to unravel events.

16:14.266 --> 16:16.848
For that alone,
I should kill you.

16:26.319 --> 16:29.026
Zhann:
As a Pa'u, I'm generally
the teacher.

16:29.114 --> 16:32.356
But with John, I... I learned
as much as I gave.

16:32.450 --> 16:36.784
Whenever he touched me,
there was an almost...

16:36.872 --> 16:39.284
(sighs) electric caring.

16:39.374 --> 16:43.367
John Crichton...
made me a better captain.

16:43.461 --> 16:46.168
I sensed a, a purity of spirit.

16:46.256 --> 16:47.245
Better leader.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.955
A purity of soul.

16:49.509 --> 16:50.749
Better man.

16:52.053 --> 16:54.590
And I'm supposed to just
take your word for it.

16:54.681 --> 16:59.391
This hair could be as fake as
this iceberg, this world.

16:59.853 --> 17:01.593
You.

17:02.314 --> 17:03.770
( blows )

17:03.857 --> 17:06.815
That hair represents a possible
outcome, an unrealized reality.

17:06.902 --> 17:09.894
Caroline:
When he'd come over, I'd have to
cover up all the mirrors,

17:09.988 --> 17:12.730
just so he'd spend some of
the time looking at me.

17:12.824 --> 17:15.156
Cousin:
My dad and John's morn are
brother and sister.

17:15.243 --> 17:17.325
Coach:
Crichton blew a key tackle!

17:17.412 --> 17:20.154
My three-year-old niece could've
tripped this guy up.

17:20.248 --> 17:22.284
It hurt Dad 'cause he loved
family so much,

17:22.375 --> 17:26.539
but we were forbidden to
hang out with John after
he was about 15.

17:26.630 --> 17:28.370
D.K.:
You know why he's dead?
Pig-headed.

17:28.465 --> 17:31.707
Woman:
He actually made a couple
of passes at me.

17:31.801 --> 17:34.087
We weren't ready for a
space trial, not really.

17:34.179 --> 17:37.797
Like I'm gonna sleep with a
guy who only has one
graduate degree.

17:37.891 --> 17:41.349
Carolyn:
He was a cheap date, a lousy
drunk, and a redneck.

17:41.436 --> 17:46.021
Reverend:
If I say "blasphemous",
I don't mean in his attitudes toward God.

17:46.107 --> 17:48.598
I mean his attitude toward life.

17:48.693 --> 17:51.560
He was lousy in the sack.

17:53.990 --> 17:56.242
Damn, I always knew Reverend
Miller didn't like me.

17:56.326 --> 18:00.239
But Caroline? That's...
that's a bit of a shock.

18:00.330 --> 18:03.322
This wormhole. You lingered so
long I was able to locate you.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.702
Describe this fascination.

18:06.336 --> 18:08.543
I don't know.

18:08.630 --> 18:10.416
Something just struck me.

18:10.507 --> 18:12.372
It is part of an
extensive system.

18:12.467 --> 18:16.460
One of untold number which
permeate the space and
time of your realm.

18:16.554 --> 18:19.967
Tell me about...
unrealized reality.

18:20.058 --> 18:21.798
(whooshing )

18:21.893 --> 18:27.263
(groaning):
Oh, no, this is that dream where
I wake up in a cell, naked.

18:29.567 --> 18:31.148
( exhales )

18:31.236 --> 18:33.773
Thank Heaven for simple mercies.

18:33.863 --> 18:35.819
One out of two.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.275
So you won again.

18:39.369 --> 18:41.360
Two of three.

18:48.253 --> 18:50.369
Officer Aeryn Sun.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.132
Special Peacekeeper Commando.

18:53.216 --> 18:56.879
Icarian Company,
Pleisar Regiment.

18:56.970 --> 18:59.336
My name Jose Jimenez.

19:00.432 --> 19:02.673
We got a lot to catch up on.

19:08.231 --> 19:09.562
(Aeryn grunts )

19:09.649 --> 19:10.729
( pants )

19:10.817 --> 19:12.728
(grunting)

19:15.447 --> 19:18.189
Pretty good, huh?

19:18.283 --> 19:20.524
I learned from the best.

19:20.618 --> 19:22.028
You.

19:27.876 --> 19:29.992
Why are you out of uniform?

19:32.005 --> 19:36.339
What is your rank and regiment?

19:39.596 --> 19:42.053
( Crichton grunting )

19:42.140 --> 19:44.347
( groans )

19:51.775 --> 19:54.608
Oh, baby, you had me at hello.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.151
Rank and regiment.

19:57.238 --> 19:58.444
Now.

19:58.531 --> 20:01.443
And how do you know my name?

20:01.534 --> 20:06.119
What you should really ask
is howl know you've
got a birthmark

20:06.206 --> 20:08.993
on the sweet spot of your hip.

20:12.837 --> 20:19.003
Every wormhole system has
millions of exits, each to a
distinct time and place.

20:19.094 --> 20:22.837
Travel from A to B.
Now, attempt to travel back.

20:22.931 --> 20:25.638
You could arrive at point A
immediately after you left,

20:25.725 --> 20:28.057
or a cycle later,
or a cycle earlier,

20:28.144 --> 20:32.729
or ten or ten thousand.
Millions of permutations.

20:32.816 --> 20:37.276
The secret is
understanding time.

20:37.362 --> 20:40.024
Not so much understanding,
as accounting for.

20:40.115 --> 20:45.030
Unskilled wanderings create
unrealized realities.

20:52.252 --> 20:54.868
So what you showed me
wasn't real?

20:54.963 --> 20:56.919
If I had not pulled you back,

20:57.006 --> 21:00.214
wherever it was you went would
have become your reality
from then on.

21:01.219 --> 21:03.255
Does not compute.

21:03.346 --> 21:07.305
Are you saying that there's
millions of me running around
with millions of pathetic lives?

21:07.392 --> 21:09.599
One of you, with millions
of potential realities,

21:09.686 --> 21:13.645
depending on where and when
you emerge from this system.

21:14.899 --> 21:16.855
If you do.

21:20.989 --> 21:23.105
Time.

21:23.199 --> 21:25.406
Going forward's not a
problem, is it?

21:25.493 --> 21:28.906
Going backward, that
screws the pooch.

21:31.291 --> 21:35.159
Should a traveler appear earlier
in the timeline of his
own existence,

21:35.253 --> 21:43.251
he would be but as a pebble
cast upon still waters.

21:43.344 --> 21:47.212
But the ripples he creates
would, over time, radiate upon
far distant shores,

21:47.307 --> 21:49.719
geometrically altering
events in its path.

21:49.809 --> 21:53.176
And your Ancients gave me
just enough knowledge
to be dangerous.

21:53.271 --> 21:57.264
Without such input, the odds of
anyone else actually appearing

21:57.358 --> 21:59.144
at a destination they
previously occupied

21:59.235 --> 22:03.478
is so remote as to be
mathematically disharmonious.

22:04.199 --> 22:07.737
Then why am I not dead already?

22:07.827 --> 22:10.068
I trust the one who
entrusted you.

22:10.163 --> 22:14.202
But I need to understand why
he bestowed this ability.

22:17.879 --> 22:20.245
Are you afraid of this
knowledge?

22:21.424 --> 22:23.039
No.

22:28.598 --> 22:30.839
There is still time.

22:45.365 --> 22:47.196
Shall we go, sir?

22:48.326 --> 22:49.816
Mm-hmm.

22:53.748 --> 22:56.581
The Scarran spy,
as you commanded.

23:01.256 --> 23:02.996
Release her.

23:03.091 --> 23:04.331
Sir?

23:04.425 --> 23:05.710
Release her.

23:05.802 --> 23:07.167
After what happened, is that...

23:07.262 --> 23:09.127
Are you questioning my orders?

23:09.222 --> 23:11.213
Release the spy.

23:14.143 --> 23:16.429
Now watch...

23:16.521 --> 23:18.432
and learn.

23:23.236 --> 23:27.320
Be cool and no one'll get hurt.

23:27.407 --> 23:29.568
Sikozu:
What of those already hurt?

23:29.659 --> 23:34.278
Crichton:
Someone, sometime, has to
end the madness.

23:38.251 --> 23:42.244
I will never tell you what
you want to know.

23:42.338 --> 23:46.422
Frankly, my dear, I don't give
a damn. I'm just trying
to keep you alive.

23:49.470 --> 23:51.176
Thank you.

23:51.264 --> 23:52.014
(grunting)

23:52.098 --> 23:53.759
Guards! Stop her!

23:56.269 --> 23:58.305
Captain, stay down!

24:10.742 --> 24:12.448
(groaning)

24:23.087 --> 24:26.420
(exhaling slowly)

24:30.428 --> 24:35.013
Weak species.

24:41.648 --> 24:43.309
( body thuds )

24:56.245 --> 24:58.031
That wasn't me.

24:58.122 --> 24:59.373
That's not me.

24:59.457 --> 25:02.199
Whatever it was, would be you.
Could be you.

25:02.293 --> 25:04.500
Which is why our vigilance
is so high.

25:04.587 --> 25:07.294
Why the knowledge to navigate
wormholes must be suppressed,

25:07.382 --> 25:09.213
and why you trouble me.

25:09.300 --> 25:11.336
You want me not to have
the knowledge?

25:11.427 --> 25:12.587
Take it out of my head.

25:12.679 --> 25:14.340
(grunting)

25:19.102 --> 25:21.388
I'm kinda surprised that worked.

25:22.105 --> 25:23.470
Sorry.

25:24.857 --> 25:26.393
This is not me, either.

25:26.484 --> 25:29.817
(rumbling)

25:34.242 --> 25:37.359
My ability to maintain this
environment is weakening.

25:38.579 --> 25:41.241
Just take back what your
Ancients put in my head.

25:41.332 --> 25:42.412
Impossible.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.161
Impractical and
possibly imprudent.

25:44.252 --> 25:46.618
What do you desire
with wormholes?

25:46.713 --> 25:51.457
For starters? To go home.

25:51.551 --> 25:54.008
Your place of origin is where
you can do the most damage.

25:55.346 --> 25:56.802
Oh, God.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.299
John!

25:58.391 --> 26:02.054
He's never faithful to
his girlfriends.

26:02.145 --> 26:03.385
Well, he made it perfectly clear

26:03.479 --> 26:06.516
that his work was a greater
priority than I was.

26:06.607 --> 26:08.222
( screaming )

26:08.317 --> 26:10.854
The womanizing, the drink...

26:10.945 --> 26:13.152
Yes, I got the point.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.149
Drugs.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.322
The point. Yes. But the risk?

26:16.409 --> 26:17.649
People you don't recognize.

26:17.744 --> 26:19.700
A world changed irrevocably
by the toss of a pebble.

26:19.787 --> 26:22.654
Well just shove me back
down the wormhole.
-I cannot.

26:22.749 --> 26:24.614
Why not? You did it for
Moya and Pilot.

26:24.709 --> 26:27.246
Propulsion. You are the first to
be brought here without vehicle.

26:27.336 --> 26:30.203
So how the hell am I supposed
to get off this rock?

26:30.298 --> 26:31.162
Through the wormhole.

26:31.257 --> 26:32.372
With what propulsion?

26:32.467 --> 26:35.425
The smoke you're
blowing up my ass?

26:35.511 --> 26:39.095
You possess the knowledge!

26:41.267 --> 26:43.258
(rumbling)

26:45.813 --> 26:47.644
I have little time.

26:47.732 --> 26:50.348
From the moment the Ancients
implanted that knowledge,

26:50.443 --> 26:52.149
you exist to service a larger...

26:52.236 --> 26:54.272
No. No.

26:55.239 --> 26:57.230
That's what you want.

26:58.242 --> 27:00.233
My name is John Crichton.

27:00.328 --> 27:02.239
I'm not your pawn.

27:04.749 --> 27:07.206
Then let us proceed.

27:07.293 --> 27:10.251
(rumbling and cracking)

27:19.222 --> 27:21.213
John Crichton?

27:21.307 --> 27:22.217
Arrogant.

27:22.308 --> 27:23.138
Impulsive.

27:23.226 --> 27:24.215
Self-absorbed.

27:24.310 --> 27:25.550
Insane.
-Ignorant.

27:25.645 --> 27:28.307
You tell me.
The guy was an idiot.

27:28.397 --> 27:33.687
I once shared Unity with that
"Uuman", and the experience
still haunts me.

27:33.778 --> 27:35.609
Don't go any further.
That is John Crichton.

27:35.696 --> 27:37.857
I'm glad he's dead.

27:39.867 --> 27:44.327
Why don't you just grab anyone
that goes wormholing and
be done with it?

27:44.413 --> 27:46.825
Simply the effort to encounter
you was massive.

27:46.916 --> 27:50.750
We can no more function in your
realm than you in ours.

27:50.837 --> 27:53.294
Which is why the Ancients
were important to us.

27:53.381 --> 27:56.623
So modify more of your people
and send them over.

27:56.717 --> 28:03.088
The endeavor is in hand, but
requires time for metamorphosis.

28:03.182 --> 28:05.639
Have you truly chosen
to help prevent

28:05.726 --> 28:08.559
aggressive species from
acquiring this knowledge?

28:08.646 --> 28:11.558
As a career?

28:11.649 --> 28:12.559
No.

28:12.650 --> 28:14.436
We have little time.

28:14.527 --> 28:17.189
And there is much you
need exposure to.

28:17.280 --> 28:19.817
(rumbling)

28:19.907 --> 28:21.317
What's happening?

28:23.119 --> 28:26.782
I must soon reenter my realm.

28:28.791 --> 28:30.952
And what happens to me?

28:32.461 --> 28:36.875
If you have learned enough
to survive, reinsertion
to the wormhole.

28:36.966 --> 28:40.254
Now, pay attention and listen.

28:41.429 --> 28:44.216
Sagaciously.

28:44.307 --> 28:50.098
From every point of entry,
a wormhole branches into
multiple parts.

28:50.187 --> 28:52.849
The subdivision
continues until...

28:52.940 --> 28:54.976
D.K.:
The subdivision continues
until, at length

28:55.067 --> 28:57.149
Einstein:
...you're deposited back
into space-time.

28:57.236 --> 28:59.943
The journey can be random
or with purpose.

29:00.031 --> 29:02.147
...or with purpose.
-Destination is the key.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.698
D.K.:
Every portal has a distinct
space-time signature.

29:04.785 --> 29:07.492
Caroline:
The only destinations you can
realize by design,

29:07.580 --> 29:09.616
are those of which you
have foreknowledge.

29:09.707 --> 29:12.414
Caroline:
The more you travel the more
signatures you will catalogue.

29:12.501 --> 29:16.335
Our Ancients have given you the
ability to recognize these
subtle differences.

29:16.422 --> 29:19.209
D.K.:
Since every destination is
surrounded by similar...

29:19.300 --> 29:21.040
...unrealized realities...

29:21.135 --> 29:22.841
...the closer you travel...

29:22.929 --> 29:23.918
...the more you must maintain...

29:24.013 --> 29:25.128
...absolute engrossment.

29:25.222 --> 29:26.758
And never return...

29:26.849 --> 29:28.134
...to a familiar place...

29:28.225 --> 29:29.476
...prior to the last...

29:29.560 --> 29:30.936
...Iast time you left...

29:31.020 --> 29:32.635
...Iast time you left.

29:32.730 --> 29:35.096
D.K.:
...prior to the last
time you left.

29:35.191 --> 29:38.604
Caroline:
Your next journey may lead to
a permanent unrealized...

29:38.694 --> 29:40.309
Teacheh
...permanent unrealized...

29:40.404 --> 29:41.610
...unrealized reality...

29:41.697 --> 29:43.358
...reality.

29:44.283 --> 29:46.239
He... here.

29:48.245 --> 29:49.530
Hot dog?

29:51.332 --> 29:52.242
Hurry.

29:52.333 --> 29:53.539
Hot dog?

29:53.626 --> 29:57.118
Learn. See. Feel.

30:00.591 --> 30:03.173
Did you bring the mustard
and onions?

30:03.260 --> 30:05.421
Crichton:
Uh... yeah.

30:06.889 --> 30:08.925
Glad you could make it, son.

30:09.016 --> 30:10.972
Well, I can't stay long.

30:11.769 --> 30:13.555
I gotta get back to work.

30:13.646 --> 30:15.932
I was hoping we could
have a talk.

30:16.440 --> 30:17.816
Hot dog?

30:19.276 --> 30:21.483
Yeah.

30:21.570 --> 30:24.312
I always loved your dogs.

30:24.407 --> 30:27.615
Corn on the cob, too.
Watermelon. All your favorites.

30:30.329 --> 30:34.322
So, what did you wanna
talk about?

30:35.292 --> 30:37.157
You.

30:37.253 --> 30:40.086
A talk we should've
had years ago.

30:40.172 --> 30:43.255
I don't think I'm still
a virgin, Dad.

30:43.342 --> 30:45.719
You can't beat this.

30:45.803 --> 30:48.715
And I hate to see you waste your
energy on the impossible.

30:48.806 --> 30:53.175
Impossible's a daily part
of my life.

30:53.269 --> 30:57.137
You remember what we were
like centuries before the
Scarrans conquered us?

30:57.982 --> 30:59.973
Weak genes.

31:00.067 --> 31:03.400
Disease. Death.

31:03.487 --> 31:08.402
I think our health and longevity
outweigh some personal freedoms,
don't you, son?

31:08.868 --> 31:10.404
No.

31:11.495 --> 31:13.326
You'll never change.

31:14.123 --> 31:16.330
But you're young.

31:16.417 --> 31:18.123
I never told you this,

31:18.210 --> 31:22.749
but when I was young,
I wanted to fly, too.

31:22.840 --> 31:24.580
Space.

31:24.675 --> 31:26.711
A dream.

31:26.802 --> 31:29.088
But it wasn't to be.

31:29.180 --> 31:31.717
And it won't be for you, either.

31:32.349 --> 31:34.431
I can't accept this.

31:34.518 --> 31:36.349
Any of it.

31:36.437 --> 31:39.520
I know I'm not much of
a hero to you, son.

31:39.607 --> 31:44.692
But if it means anything, I'd
still like to walk on the moon.

31:48.491 --> 31:50.903
This place disintegrates.

31:53.079 --> 31:55.821
Don't let me go again.
You gotta...

31:55.915 --> 31:58.247
you gotta put me back in my
own time, my own place.

31:58.334 --> 32:00.199
But you put me back where
you found me.

32:00.294 --> 32:02.831
Caroline:
You can do that yourself.

32:06.383 --> 32:10.422
I don't... understand
any of this.

32:10.513 --> 32:11.878
Caroline:
There's nothing to understand.

32:11.972 --> 32:13.348
It's not a science, John.

32:13.432 --> 32:14.262
It's an art.

32:14.350 --> 32:16.261
You failed me in Art.

32:16.352 --> 32:17.717
Not to mention third
grade English.

32:17.812 --> 32:20.303
And I still do not understand
the proper use of a comma!

32:20.397 --> 32:22.388
You did not forget
the A, Johnny.

32:22.483 --> 32:25.520
You wrote a report about
Mark "Twin."

32:25.611 --> 32:28.728
You can hear me.

32:28.823 --> 32:30.438
How do I get back to Moya?

32:30.533 --> 32:33.570
Focus on the space-time
signature where you entered
the wormhole.

32:33.661 --> 32:38.280
Every system is like a maze that
loops back upon itself.

32:38.374 --> 32:39.705
Focus. Get back to Moya.

32:39.792 --> 32:42.625
After you have left her.

32:42.711 --> 32:45.202
Well what if I screw up?
What if I get there before?

32:45.297 --> 32:46.332
You afraid, buddy?

32:46.423 --> 32:48.129
Yes. No. Maybe.

32:48.217 --> 32:51.459
If you get back to ship before
you left, the pebble that drops
will be close to you.

32:51.554 --> 32:53.636
Ignore the ripples.

32:53.722 --> 32:55.974
Fix the first thing
that goes ape.

32:56.058 --> 32:58.299
Fix the first thing.
What was that about the ripples?

32:58.394 --> 33:03.434
The elasticity of time allows
for unrealized realities
to remain so.

33:03.524 --> 33:05.640
Reverend:
If events are matched closely
enough to course...

33:05.734 --> 33:09.647
Caroline:
...they have a way of
restructuring themselves to familiar outcomes.

33:09.738 --> 33:14.448
Harvey:
If matched closely enough to
course, events have a way of restructuring themselves.

33:14.952 --> 33:16.783
Harvey knew.

33:18.080 --> 33:19.490
Harvey knew.

33:20.708 --> 33:22.949
Harvey knew!

33:23.752 --> 33:25.583
Scorpius knew.

33:25.671 --> 33:27.502
How?

33:37.057 --> 33:38.388
How?!

33:42.438 --> 33:44.679
I mean, I like him,
but he was, uh...

33:44.773 --> 33:45.637
Insolent.

33:45.733 --> 33:46.688
Selfish.

33:46.775 --> 33:47.309
Competitive.

33:47.401 --> 33:48.516
Obsessive.

33:48.611 --> 33:49.566
Obnoxious.

33:49.653 --> 33:51.189
Unbearable.

33:52.156 --> 33:54.989
Hey, I think we should run.

33:56.243 --> 33:58.234
You wanna to run? Let's run!

33:58.329 --> 34:00.069
Chiana.

34:00.164 --> 34:01.028
Shoulda run.

34:01.123 --> 34:02.454
Chiana!
-|'m coming.

34:02.541 --> 34:04.281
What did you find?

34:04.376 --> 34:06.116
Just these. Barely charged.

34:06.212 --> 34:07.873
They're gone.

34:07.963 --> 34:09.954
My love, your love.
My love, your love.

34:10.049 --> 34:12.165
Our loves. Gone.

34:12.259 --> 34:15.126
Suicide.
Suicide and they're gone!

34:15.221 --> 34:18.304
They're trying to make peace
with the Peacekeepers.
What are you doing?

34:18.390 --> 34:20.221
Plot a course.

34:20.309 --> 34:22.265
A course. A course. Yes, yes.

34:22.353 --> 34:24.639
You should eat something.

34:25.940 --> 34:27.146
Before you die.

34:28.734 --> 34:29.519
John Crichton?

34:29.610 --> 34:31.350
Crichton.

34:31.445 --> 34:32.309
( screaming )

34:32.404 --> 34:34.736
Nope. Not in the space program.

34:34.823 --> 34:36.359
Glasses?

34:36.450 --> 34:38.361
Accountant?
( screaming )

34:38.452 --> 34:42.195
See, our families were never
close, so I think I only
saw him once.

34:42.289 --> 34:44.496
I could look him up
in the Who's Who.

34:44.583 --> 34:45.789
( screaming )

34:45.876 --> 34:47.161
Are you sure I know him?

34:47.253 --> 34:49.335
Maybe he went to State.

34:49.421 --> 34:53.414
Einstein:
For every point of entry, a
wormhole branches into multiple paths.

34:53.509 --> 34:55.716
D.K.:
The subdivision continues
until at length...

34:55.803 --> 34:57.589
The subdivision
continues until...

34:57.680 --> 35:00.513
The journey can be random
or with purpose.

35:00.599 --> 35:02.305
...you're deposited back
into space-time.

35:02.393 --> 35:04.805
Destination is the key.
-Destination is the key.

35:04.895 --> 35:09.138
Destination is the key
-Destination is the key.

35:09.233 --> 35:11.895
"D'Argo":
Pilot, I demand you give
me Starburst now.

35:11.986 --> 35:15.274
"Chiana":
Starburst? Zhaan and Aeryn are
out there under a flag of truce.

35:15.364 --> 35:17.150
D'Argo's regained consciousness.

35:17.241 --> 35:18.856
He and Crichton are
eager to leave.

35:18.951 --> 35:22.239
Don't! Don't!
They're peaceful. Please.

35:22.329 --> 35:25.412
"Stark":
No! Cannot leave my lady.

35:25.499 --> 35:27.410
My love, my life.

35:27.501 --> 35:29.457
"Rygel":
Transport Pod's loaded
with supplies

35:29.545 --> 35:32.958
but there are Marauders
waiting to shoot us down.
We can't escape.

35:33.048 --> 35:34.663
We're trapped?

35:34.758 --> 35:37.170
"Rygel":
That's what "We can't escape"
means. Go help Stark hyperventilate.

35:37.261 --> 35:39.422
Well if you'd just let
me negotiate...

35:39.513 --> 35:40.673
We mean you no harm.

35:40.764 --> 35:42.345
No.

35:42.433 --> 35:45.345
Well, I could...
I could bake something.
(grunts)

35:45.436 --> 35:48.303
D.K.:
Since every destination is
surrounded by similar...

35:48.397 --> 35:49.603
...unrealized realities.

35:49.690 --> 35:51.305
The closer you travel
closer you travel...

35:51.400 --> 35:52.856
...the more you must maintain...

35:52.943 --> 35:54.558
The closer you travel the
more you must maintain...

35:54.653 --> 35:57.565
the more you must maintain
absolute engrossment.

35:57.656 --> 36:00.068
Pilot, where are you, you
four-armed tralk ?

36:00.159 --> 36:04.869
Pilot:
Right now, Moya couldn't
Starburst the length or your stubby little arm.

36:04.955 --> 36:06.616
This stubby little arm is...

36:06.707 --> 36:11.292
ls short, as is our ability to
maneuver, accelerate,
or defend ourselves.

36:11.378 --> 36:12.959
Why doesn't anything work?

36:13.047 --> 36:14.958
Because, slutty tralk,

36:15.049 --> 36:20.260
of all the half-frelled
modifications for his
wormhole experiments.

36:20.346 --> 36:22.632
Caroline:
And never we return to
a familiar place...

36:22.723 --> 36:24.133
...prior to the last time
you left.

36:24.224 --> 36:25.304
...prior to the time...

36:25.392 --> 36:26.427
...prior to the last time...

36:26.518 --> 36:27.598
...prior to the last...

36:27.686 --> 36:29.472
...prior to the last
time you left.

36:29.563 --> 36:32.270
Coach:
Prior to the last time you left.

36:36.945 --> 36:39.937
Now just why won't you
help us, Crichton?

36:42.117 --> 36:43.823
Because, like everybody
else here,

36:43.911 --> 36:46.368
I... don't wanna be
here anymore.

36:46.872 --> 36:49.113
( screaming )

36:49.208 --> 36:50.744
You have to fix what
you've done.

36:50.834 --> 36:52.210
But. Yeah, I haven't...
-Fix it.

36:52.294 --> 36:53.830
Can't you see he's distracted?

36:53.921 --> 36:55.206
No!

36:55.297 --> 36:56.753
Scat! Go on!

36:58.884 --> 37:00.169
This...

37:00.260 --> 37:03.752
This will free you from any
thoughts of your betrothed.

37:03.847 --> 37:05.178
(grunting)

37:05.265 --> 37:06.345
No, no, no, honestly.

37:06.433 --> 37:08.298
She... She's not on my mind
anymore, Grandma.

37:08.394 --> 37:11.352
So big. So beautiful.

37:12.398 --> 37:13.729
So blue.

37:14.817 --> 37:16.307
Aeryn!
-Blue?

37:16.402 --> 37:17.687
Come back to me!

37:17.778 --> 37:19.393
You're very pretty.

37:19.780 --> 37:20.860
Oh!

37:20.948 --> 37:22.358
Fix it!

37:22.449 --> 37:24.314
Yes, fix it!

37:24.410 --> 37:26.492
You really should have
picked me over Zhaan.

37:26.578 --> 37:29.069
Absolutely, next time, when
I'm gonna move house.

37:29.164 --> 37:30.950
The dren gets worse, morons.

37:31.041 --> 37:33.874
All right, I should die
at any time now.

37:35.838 --> 37:37.374
We haven't done anything.

37:37.464 --> 37:40.501
Einstein, any time...
-Fix Starburst, you
miscreant species!

37:41.260 --> 37:42.591
(groaning)

37:45.139 --> 37:46.754
( screaming )

37:46.849 --> 37:47.884
No!

37:48.642 --> 37:54.308
( screaming )

37:56.400 --> 37:58.686
Crais, you yotzfotz bastard!

37:58.777 --> 37:59.983
We had a deal!

38:00.070 --> 38:01.901
A deal? You tried to
sell us out.

38:01.989 --> 38:03.570
You bet your fekkik, tenka head.

38:03.657 --> 38:04.988
It's every Hynerian for himself.

38:05.075 --> 38:06.781
Pilot:
We're being blasted apart!

38:06.869 --> 38:07.779
( screams )

38:07.870 --> 38:09.701
This way. Weapon's primed.

38:09.788 --> 38:11.574
Pilot:
The Peacekeepers have boarded.

38:11.665 --> 38:13.280
( screaming )
(giggles )

38:13.375 --> 38:16.583
Oh. If company's coming, I can
bake some skrinberrry muffins.

38:16.670 --> 38:18.501
(trilling)

38:18.589 --> 38:20.250
Let's go and kill Peacekeepers.

38:20.340 --> 38:22.251
Chiana, remain at your post.
-No.

38:22.342 --> 38:24.333
Starburst, rig for
manual activation.

38:24.428 --> 38:26.339
( screaming )
-I got it.

38:27.347 --> 38:30.134
Well, that's it.
That's it, I quit.

38:30.225 --> 38:32.216
"D'Argo":
Stay at your post, Chiana.

38:32.311 --> 38:36.930
"Chiana":
You know, you suck worse as a
captain than you did in bed.

38:37.024 --> 38:39.310
That was helpful.
-Can you fix Starburst?

38:39.401 --> 38:40.811
I don't think so.
What about your ship?

38:40.903 --> 38:43.019
What ship?
-Lo'La.

38:43.113 --> 38:45.229
"D'Argo":
Lo'Laan was my wife.

38:45.324 --> 38:47.189
Are you mocking me on
death's threshold?

38:47.284 --> 38:48.774
Never, little big man. Never.

38:48.869 --> 38:53.863
"Jool":
Um, excuse me, but she is having
some sort of fit. She's dying.

38:53.957 --> 38:55.663
Happens when I'm stressed.

38:55.751 --> 38:58.458
Stark, pull yourself together.
-Won't be very... Let me go
to work, please.

38:58.545 --> 39:00.331
Send her to a better place.

39:00.422 --> 39:02.834
Oh, please, I don't wanna die.
I don't wanna go down like that.

39:02.925 --> 39:04.165
Crichton:
Heal her pain.

39:04.259 --> 39:06.716
Wanna a fight, you got a fight.

39:06.803 --> 39:09.465
"D'Argo":
Do your worst. I will never
be taken prisoner again.

39:09.556 --> 39:10.671
( screams )

39:13.143 --> 39:14.929
Aah! I am bleeding.

39:15.020 --> 39:17.386
Will you look at me?
I am bleeding. I...

39:17.481 --> 39:19.472
Calm down.

39:19.566 --> 39:22.729
"Rygel":
They're on board! We give
them what they want. Anything they want.

39:22.819 --> 39:25.196
Take no prisoners.

39:25.280 --> 39:26.690
They cannot die.

39:26.782 --> 39:29.114
Corporeal illusion.

39:29.201 --> 39:31.157
Return. Replenish.

39:31.245 --> 39:33.486
You! You shoot me.

39:33.580 --> 39:34.956
Shoot now!

39:35.040 --> 39:36.450
Coming back, Stark?

39:37.376 --> 39:38.115
Always.

39:38.210 --> 39:40.326
No, no, no, no.
What are you doing?

39:40.420 --> 39:41.626
Giving her a second chance.

39:41.713 --> 39:45.126
"Stark":
Katratzi ozanatha katratzi.

39:45.217 --> 39:46.206
(pained sigh)

39:46.301 --> 39:48.292
Execute on sight.
-Yes, sir.

39:48.387 --> 39:50.469
Shoot now!

39:50.556 --> 39:52.638
( groans )

39:52.724 --> 39:54.555
(whimpers and shrieks)

40:00.357 --> 40:02.268
My brother's murderer.

40:03.777 --> 40:05.187
You are dead, Crichton.

40:05.279 --> 40:07.065
Captain Crais.

40:07.155 --> 40:09.237
I am Dominar Rygel
the Sixteenth.

40:09.324 --> 40:10.484
I trust our deal will
be honored...

40:10.576 --> 40:12.942
( groans )

40:13.036 --> 40:14.537
Einstein:
What you experienced was real...

40:14.621 --> 40:16.907
What you experienced was real...

40:16.999 --> 40:19.490
D.K.:
You afraid, buddy? (echoes)

40:19.585 --> 40:24.750
Einstein:
Wherever it was you went will
become your reality from then on. (echoes)

40:24.840 --> 40:29.083
Einstein:
Are you afraid of this
knowledge? ( echoes )

40:31.138 --> 40:32.594
( explosion )

40:33.265 --> 40:35.301
Well done, comrade.

40:37.227 --> 40:39.309
Well done.

40:39.396 --> 40:44.015
D.K.:
Your next journey may lead
to a permanent...

40:44.109 --> 40:45.269
...to a permanent...

40:45.360 --> 40:46.145
...to a permanent...

40:46.236 --> 40:47.442
...to a permanent...

40:47.529 --> 40:49.611
...to a permanent
unrealized reality.

40:49.698 --> 40:51.359
...reality.

40:53.410 --> 40:56.823
I almost could not retrieve you.

40:57.998 --> 40:59.534
Yeah, I noticed.

41:01.043 --> 41:03.625
We're running out
of real estate.

41:03.712 --> 41:07.125
This construct disintegrates.

41:08.050 --> 41:11.918
Next time, your reality...

41:12.012 --> 41:13.172
forever.

41:13.263 --> 41:16.175
No next time. Leave me.

41:17.351 --> 41:20.218
To die? Why?

41:20.312 --> 41:22.052
Too risky.

41:22.147 --> 41:23.808
All of it.

41:24.816 --> 41:27.307
Best to leave me.

41:28.195 --> 41:31.403
Are you suddenly
becoming afraid?

41:36.078 --> 41:37.659
Yes.

41:37.746 --> 41:40.362
Of the damage I can do, yes.

41:42.417 --> 41:44.408
Fear.

41:44.503 --> 41:48.166
Fear is the correct answer.

42:01.061 --> 42:02.676
(grunts)

42:02.771 --> 42:04.762
Can't do it.

42:04.856 --> 42:06.721
You'd rather die?

42:06.817 --> 42:10.059
Not particularly. But I liked my
childhood and I don't wanna
scramble the eggs.

42:10.153 --> 42:12.485
Should aggressive species
puncture the wormhole,

42:12.572 --> 42:15.359
the consequences for both our
realms would be unimaginable.

42:19.329 --> 42:20.944
Ah, screw it.

42:21.039 --> 42:26.875
But I am not Kirk, Spock,
Luke, Buck, Flash or
Arthur frelling Dent.

42:26.962 --> 42:31.205
I am Dorothy Gale from Kansas,
and you are gonna hire
more Ancients.

42:31.299 --> 42:34.587
Then simply permit yourself
to perish prior to reaching
a destination.

42:35.679 --> 42:37.340
Moya.

42:38.098 --> 42:39.213
After.

42:39.307 --> 42:42.845
Her space-time signature
will be familiar.

42:43.562 --> 42:45.143
Powerful.

42:45.230 --> 42:47.095
Moya.

42:47.190 --> 42:50.307
Fear is your providence.

42:50.402 --> 42:52.893
Feel the force.
-Adjust.

42:53.447 --> 42:55.563
Maintain focus.

42:55.657 --> 42:56.988
Focus.

42:57.075 --> 42:59.316
Harmony.

43:01.747 --> 43:06.832
When this is over, you're gonna
take this crap out of my head.

43:06.918 --> 43:10.285
Someday, should you survive.

43:11.840 --> 43:13.671
After.

43:14.718 --> 43:18.961
Do you now know what it is?

43:23.477 --> 43:26.344
(inhales)

43:33.403 --> 43:34.984
Time.

43:35.071 --> 43:38.234
(loud rumbling)

43:55.008 --> 43:57.294
( raspy breathing )

43:57.803 --> 43:59.293
D'Argo?

43:59.387 --> 44:01.298
Pilot?

44:44.808 --> 44:46.344
Whoops.
