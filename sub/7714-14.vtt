10:48.814 --> 10:51.691
Okay. l told the story
of your uncle,

10:51.776 --> 10:53.860
and l have a feeling
that you would've really,

10:54.654 --> 10:57.238
really been proud
of the way. . . Okay.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.325
Wait a minute, who is it?
Who's there?
What?

11:00.409 --> 11:01.993
Is there somebody
in the room with you?

11:02.078 --> 11:04.913
I want to see who it is.
Turn me around.

11:04.997 --> 11:06.665
l don't. lt's just. . .

11:06.749 --> 11:09.209
Turn me around. Now.

11:10.628 --> 11:13.380
(WHlSTLES) Hey, buddy?
Was it something I said?

11:13.464 --> 11:17.467
Hello. No. My name's
Michael Scott. Hello.

11:17.551 --> 11:19.844
Well, hello, Mr. Scott,
pleased to meet you.

11:19.929 --> 11:24.015
Nice to meet you.
We are very excited
about the merger with Sabre.

11:24.183 --> 11:25.892
l think you have
a great accent.

11:25.976 --> 11:29.771
Thank you.
I've been working on it
since I was a little girl.

11:29.855 --> 11:33.108
To what do I owe the pleasure
of this video chat?

11:33.442 --> 11:38.279
Well, l am a little concerned
about all these changes,
to be quite frank.

11:38.781 --> 11:42.409
l think we have done things
a certain way here
at Dunder Mifflin

11:42.493 --> 11:43.868
for quite some time.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.870
Pardon.
Pardon me, Mr. Scott,

11:45.955 --> 11:47.872
but the Iast time
I saw a company

11:47.957 --> 11:49.833
as mismanaged
as Dunder MiffIin

11:49.917 --> 11:52.168
was my grandson's
snowball company,

11:52.253 --> 11:54.546
so you'll excuse me
if I'd prefer

11:54.630 --> 11:56.673
that you all adapt to
the way we do things.

11:57.341 --> 12:01.970
Okay. l feel very strongly
that you can't just
come in here

12:02.388 --> 12:06.015
and change everything
that people have
been doing forever.

12:09.228 --> 12:12.647
ls Christian Slater
back there?
Because he knows. . .

12:13.482 --> 12:15.316
He'd know what to do.

12:16.318 --> 12:19.446
So listen,
why don't you teII Gabe

12:20.489 --> 12:23.825
if by the end of the day
you can't handle the changes?

12:23.909 --> 12:27.454
l've already told him,
but l will tell him again,
if you think that'll help.

12:27.538 --> 12:30.832
I wouId take untiI
the end of the day
if I were you.

12:57.193 --> 12:58.860
Pam and Jim?
Hey. l'm Jerry.

12:58.944 --> 12:59.986
Hi, Jerry.

13:00.070 --> 13:01.070
Jerry.

13:01.155 --> 13:02.614
Good to see you.
Come on in.

13:02.865 --> 13:05.033
My office is
right back here.

13:06.076 --> 13:07.118
This is the playroom.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.703
This is great.

13:08.996 --> 13:10.705
Gotta confess,
we came a little early,

13:10.790 --> 13:12.415
so we got a quick
look around, but. . .

13:12.500 --> 13:13.583
So you saw it already.

13:13.667 --> 13:15.335
No. Yes, we saw this, yes.

13:15.419 --> 13:17.295
No, it wasn't like
a look around,

13:17.379 --> 13:19.088
we really
just had a peek.
Quick peek.

13:19.215 --> 13:20.965
Didn't focus on
anything in particular.
lt's lovely.

13:21.050 --> 13:22.383
(CELL PHONE RlNGlNG)

13:23.427 --> 13:24.886
Gotta take this, sorry.
JlM: Do it.

13:24.970 --> 13:25.970
Hi, this is Jerry.

13:26.055 --> 13:27.055
Okay, you've gotta
pull it together.

13:27.139 --> 13:28.598
We should just go.
He's really uncomfortable.

13:28.682 --> 13:30.350
He's uncomfortable
because you're acting weird,

13:30.434 --> 13:31.518
so you have to
stop acting weird.

13:31.602 --> 13:33.812
What if we just bring it up?
We'll just put it out
in the open?

13:33.896 --> 13:36.523
That's the weirdest
possible solution to
the problem.

13:36.607 --> 13:38.233
Sorry about that.
Right this way.

13:38.317 --> 13:39.609
All right.

13:43.364 --> 13:47.575
l have come here today
to talk to Mr. David Wallace

13:48.077 --> 13:50.912
about this whole thing
going on with Sabre.

13:50.996 --> 13:52.664
He will know
exactly what to do.

13:53.165 --> 13:55.792
He is not a big fan
of me dropping
by unannounced,

13:55.876 --> 13:57.752
but then again, who is?
(DRUMS BEATlNG)

13:58.420 --> 13:59.796
Hey. Hi.
Michael !

13:59.880 --> 14:02.799
Sorry,
l hope you're not busy
doing something.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.884
No, you kidding?
Come on in. Come on in.
You sure?

14:04.969 --> 14:06.594
You look great.
You look great, too.

14:06.679 --> 14:07.762
You hungry?
l'm just having lunch.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.639
Oh, yeah,
that sounds good.

14:09.723 --> 14:12.058
Teddy, look who
just stopped in.

14:12.726 --> 14:13.852
Hey.

14:13.936 --> 14:17.480
Hey! Wow.
That's very loud.
Keep it up, son !

Wow. Oh, yummy!

14:23.362 --> 14:26.030
You have got the life,
my friend.
Yeah.

14:26.115 --> 14:28.491
Can l just stay here
and never go back?

14:28.576 --> 14:30.451
Things not going
so well over there?

14:30.536 --> 14:32.704
Oh, man !
How much time do you have?

14:32.788 --> 14:36.124
l have a doctor's appointment
next Thursday.

14:36.458 --> 14:37.542
Yeah?

14:39.461 --> 14:43.172
Hey, honey,
how's your day going?
Did you do anything cool?

14:44.300 --> 14:46.509
No, sweetie,
l just hung out.

14:47.469 --> 14:48.678
'Cause l saw
you had shoes on,

14:48.762 --> 14:50.388
so l didn't know
if you did anything.

14:50.472 --> 14:53.600
No, just hanging out, hon.
You remember Michael?

14:54.143 --> 14:56.269
Hi. Sorry, l was just
in the neighborhood

14:56.353 --> 14:58.730
and thought
l'd come by and say. . .

14:58.814 --> 15:00.732
No problem at all.
This is great.

15:00.816 --> 15:02.650
So, what are
you guys up to?

15:04.111 --> 15:07.488
l don't know. Maybe. . .

15:07.573 --> 15:09.824
Actually, you know,
l think maybe
we'll go outside.

15:11.493 --> 15:15.246
Maybe. . .
We'll go outside?
Go outside.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.878
There was one thing
we were curious about.

15:21.962 --> 15:24.964
Your flexibility on things
like Easter or Memorial Day,

15:25.049 --> 15:27.342
because we might want
to change our days
around a little bit.

15:27.426 --> 15:29.427
That seems a bit premature,
don't you think?

15:29.511 --> 15:31.137
l don't even know
if l have a space
for you yet,

15:31.221 --> 15:33.598
and you're already lining up
your holiday plans.

15:33.682 --> 15:39.062
No, sorry,
we're kind of planners,
but we're also flexible, too,

15:39.146 --> 15:40.104
so you know what?

15:40.189 --> 15:41.606
Maybe we can just discuss it
when the time comes.

15:41.690 --> 15:44.567
Yeah. lf the time comes,
we can discuss it.

15:46.654 --> 15:49.113
ls this because
Jim walked in on you
going to the bathroom?

15:49.198 --> 15:50.323
What?

15:53.369 --> 15:55.328
Seriously? You told her?

15:56.872 --> 15:58.289
Did it. . .
lt might have come up

15:58.374 --> 15:59.958
while we were
waiting for you.

16:00.042 --> 16:01.918
And you thought that
might have something

16:02.002 --> 16:03.503
to do with how
the meeting is going?

16:03.629 --> 16:05.254
No, l didn't. . .
Maybe,
because it doesn't seem

16:05.339 --> 16:07.256
to be going super well.

16:07.466 --> 16:09.676
You didn't consider
the fact that it might
not be going super well

16:09.760 --> 16:12.762
just because
it might not be
going super well?

16:13.681 --> 16:15.723
No, 'cause we're
really nice people,

16:15.808 --> 16:17.809
but you don't
seem to like us.

16:18.227 --> 16:20.395
l'm being
perfectly pleasant.

16:20.854 --> 16:22.146
Did you ever consider
that you might not be

16:22.231 --> 16:24.399
as charming as
you think you are?

16:24.483 --> 16:28.236
This coming from the guy
who still uses
a children's toilet.

16:31.573 --> 16:33.658
Why didn't you just
lock the door, man?

16:33.742 --> 16:36.619
lt doesn't lock for
the children's safety.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.913
Anybody could have walked in.

16:40.541 --> 16:42.208
lt was story time.

16:44.712 --> 16:49.841
Sabre is changing everything.
Site blockers, they don't
let us use cups.

16:50.259 --> 16:51.926
So l started thinking,
who could handle this?

16:52.011 --> 16:53.761
Who would know what to do?

16:53.846 --> 16:55.930
David Wallace
would know what to do.

16:56.974 --> 16:58.850
What should l do,
David Wallace?

16:58.934 --> 17:00.518
l don't know.
What can you do?

17:00.602 --> 17:03.479
Mmm ! Exactly.
What are you thinking?

17:04.857 --> 17:05.857
lt's a tough one.

17:05.941 --> 17:07.150
lt is a tough one.

17:07.234 --> 17:08.526
l don't have
any ideas for you.

17:08.610 --> 17:11.279
Yeah,
but one would be good.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.906
Hey, okay, wait.

17:13.991 --> 17:15.033
Okay.

17:15.117 --> 17:17.201
l want to tell you about
a business idea l have.

17:17.286 --> 17:18.327
Okay.
Okay.

17:18.412 --> 17:21.497
You know how
kids leave their toys
everywhere? Right?

17:21.582 --> 17:24.876
So this is a vacuum.
lt's like a Shop-Vac
type of thing.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.044
(EXCLAlMS)

17:26.211 --> 17:29.630

their own toys. Right?

17:29.798 --> 17:32.341
Baseball gloves,
Hacky Sacks,

17:32.426 --> 17:35.803
drumsticks. . .
(EXCLAlMS) Picks it up.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.305
So the kid's making
the noise to pick it up?

17:37.389 --> 17:38.890
Yeah. No.

17:38.974 --> 17:40.933
No, no,
that's the vacuum noise.

17:41.018 --> 17:42.101
Okay.

17:42.644 --> 17:43.811
You don't like it.

17:43.896 --> 17:44.896
No, l think it's. . .

17:44.980 --> 17:46.230
No, it's okay.

17:46.315 --> 17:48.274
Another guy from
Dunder Mifflin,
Arnie from Research,

17:48.358 --> 17:51.819
he's gonna draw up
the prototype, and. . .

17:52.529 --> 17:55.740
lt's like a Shop-Vac.
Did l say that?

17:55.824 --> 17:56.949
Yep.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.578
lt'll be okay.

18:03.665 --> 18:05.083
Hey, any fun
weekend plans?

18:05.167 --> 18:06.667
No. You?

18:07.753 --> 18:09.212
No, actually.

18:12.841 --> 18:13.841
So, nothing?

18:13.926 --> 18:16.469
No movies or parties

18:16.553 --> 18:18.554
or anything
you might want to
invite someone to?

18:19.431 --> 18:21.390
Nothing. lt's wide open.

18:22.309 --> 18:23.392
Okay.

18:24.061 --> 18:26.312
That's as hard
as l can hint.

18:27.314 --> 18:30.399
Hey, you know, if you want,
l'm sure l could
get Arnie onboard,

18:30.484 --> 18:32.985
if you want to join us
for Suck lt.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.071

18:36.990 --> 18:38.282
"Suck lt."
That's what it's called.

18:38.367 --> 18:39.575
Oh ! Okay.

18:39.660 --> 18:40.827
Huh? Catchy.

18:40.911 --> 18:42.453
Kid's will love it.
l like it.

18:42.538 --> 18:43.830
There are very few things
that would make me

18:43.914 --> 18:46.082
not want to team up
with David Wallace,

18:46.166 --> 18:48.251
and Suck lt
is one of them.

18:50.420 --> 18:51.587

Oh, Michael.

Thank you for coming.

18:53.882 --> 18:55.424
Thanks for having me.

18:55.509 --> 18:58.761

the David Wallace

of weird creature

David Wallace's house.

ready their canteens

19:30.794 --> 19:33.838
with the sweet,
sweet nectar of
Gabe's homeland

19:33.922 --> 19:36.883
and then propose a toast.
Here we go.

19:37.050 --> 19:38.843
You know when people
say getting fired

19:38.927 --> 19:40.511
was the best thing that
ever happened to them?

19:40.596 --> 19:42.138
l feel sorry
for those people.

19:42.222 --> 19:44.557
That?
The best thing? Really?

19:44.641 --> 19:45.808
(EXCLAlMS lN DlSGUST)

19:46.268 --> 19:49.770
Well, l'm not really one
for making speeches.

19:50.439 --> 19:51.480
Yes, you are.
Since when?

19:51.565 --> 19:52.607
You make a lot.

19:52.691 --> 19:53.816
MlCHAEL: But l feel
pretty good right now.

19:53.901 --> 19:57.445
l really do.
A lot better than l did
earlier, let me tell you.

19:57.529 --> 19:58.696
That's your toast?

19:58.780 --> 20:00.323
No, this is my toast.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.452
l think this
whole thing with Sabre
is gonna work out.

20:04.536 --> 20:06.871
l have a very good
feeling about it.

20:06.955 --> 20:09.373
Michael, this isn't a toast,
you're just thinking
out loud.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.083
Here's my toast.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.588
Orange juice is in here,

20:16.798 --> 20:20.092
and like Sabre,
it is from Florida,
and it is good.

20:21.345 --> 20:23.346
Just 'cause you have liquid,
that doesn't make it a toast.

20:23.430 --> 20:26.474
Here's the toast.
l'm gonna do it now.

20:27.476 --> 20:32.772
Raise your container
to us and to Sabre.

and to Sabre.

Wow, that is metallicy.
That's like drinking
a battery.

20:45.369 --> 20:49.497
Really gets you in
the fillings, doesn't it?
Okay, anyway, welcome.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.757
Well, it's a mess,
what a mess

21:00.634 --> 21:02.260
What you gonna do

21:02.844 --> 21:06.681
You're gonna
take out your Suck It
And you'll suck it, suck it

21:07.224 --> 21:09.767
Take out your Suck It
and you'll suck it

Yeah

and we'II
