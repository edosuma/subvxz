WEBVTT

00:03.090 --> 00:04.134
- You're sleeping
with a senator?

00:04.178 --> 00:05.614
- Getting plastic surgerysomeplace weird

00:05.657 --> 00:07.485
nobody cares about,like your toes.

00:07.529 --> 00:09.183
- A high-stakes spelling bee
where if you don't win,

00:09.226 --> 00:10.662
you're killed?
- What's happening?

00:10.706 --> 00:12.229
- Adams is going
somewhere tomorrow,

00:12.273 --> 00:13.709
and she won't tell us why.

00:13.752 --> 00:16.059
- Ooh, what ifit's something nice?

00:16.103 --> 00:17.060
I hope it's something nice.

00:17.104 --> 00:18.844
- You need to respecther privacy.

00:18.888 --> 00:20.281
- Thank you.

00:20.324 --> 00:21.934
- Is what I was going to say

00:21.978 --> 00:23.284
until I thoughtof this great guess.

00:23.327 --> 00:25.373
You're cloning yourselfso you can marry yourself?

00:27.375 --> 00:28.724
- Arthur is the closest so far.

00:28.767 --> 00:30.073
- What?

00:30.117 --> 00:32.945
- So obvious.
Of course you're doing that.

00:32.989 --> 00:35.209
Told you, man.

00:35.252 --> 00:37.341
- Hey, do you mind
if I do my laundry here?

00:37.385 --> 00:40.344
- Arthur!
How perfect.

00:40.388 --> 00:42.259
I needed someone
to watch the church today.

00:42.303 --> 00:44.261
I prayed about it,
and here you are.

00:44.305 --> 00:47.134
- Wow, God really does work
in totally obvious ways.

00:47.177 --> 00:48.483
- So I'll only be gone
a couple of hours.

00:48.526 --> 00:49.527
- Well, it's Monday.

00:49.571 --> 00:50.876
Why don't you just
lock the door

00:50.920 --> 00:52.791
and leave a bucket
of Bibles on the stoop?

00:52.835 --> 00:54.271
- The church is the center
of our community

00:54.315 --> 00:55.751
seven days a week.

00:55.794 --> 00:57.318
Helping people
never takes a break.

00:59.015 --> 01:01.974
Please, I mean, it seems to methe church has a history

01:02.018 --> 01:04.368
of doing more harm than good.

01:04.412 --> 01:05.326
- Harm?

01:05.369 --> 01:08.111
Last year,
our bake sale raised over $90

01:08.155 --> 01:10.157
for tornado survivors.
What about that?

01:10.200 --> 01:11.810
- What about the Crusades?

01:11.854 --> 01:14.117
- Okay, one to one.

01:14.161 --> 01:15.727
Okay, it's 12 to 12.

01:15.771 --> 01:17.381
I'm counting
all witch trials as one.

01:18.426 --> 01:19.731
What a shock.

01:19.775 --> 01:22.517
The church minimizing
the experience of women.

01:22.560 --> 01:25.172
And I am back up by one.

01:25.215 --> 01:27.261
- As much as I would liketo continue listening to you

01:27.304 --> 01:28.697
belittle my life's work,

01:28.740 --> 01:30.133
I have to leaveto drop a casserole

01:30.177 --> 01:31.961
by a parishioner's house,and then go help a friend,

01:32.004 --> 01:32.962
so...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:33.005 --> 01:34.268
I'll watch the store for you,

01:34.311 --> 01:35.921
but I'm not praying with anyone

01:35.965 --> 01:37.532
or selling them false hope
or telling them

01:37.575 --> 01:39.969
their crappy lives
are part of "God's plan."

01:40.012 --> 01:42.189
- Well, I guessyou're the one He sent.

01:42.232 --> 01:44.060
- Hallelujah.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.106
- Unless...

01:47.759 --> 01:49.935
Well,beggers can't be choosers.

01:49.979 --> 01:52.764
At least this place comeswith its own operator's manual.

01:52.808 --> 01:53.765
- Don't say--

01:53.809 --> 01:55.158
both: The Bible.

01:55.202 --> 01:57.204
- If you're in trouble,
just turn to any page,

01:57.247 --> 02:00.250
any paragraph, and you'll find
some words of wisdom.

02:01.382 --> 02:04.385
- He shall also be uncleanif he touches a corpse

02:04.428 --> 02:06.561
or anyone who has an emission--

02:06.604 --> 02:08.302
- Just...

02:08.345 --> 02:09.955
stick to the second half.

02:09.999 --> 02:13.220
choir: ♪ Hallelujah!
Thine the glory ♪

02:13.263 --> 02:18.181
♪ Revive us again

02:18.225 --> 02:21.880
- 11 letters.
Spanish...

02:21.924 --> 02:23.273
Inquisition.

02:23.317 --> 02:26.102
I can't believe I forgot
to bring that up with Jax.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.322
- Reverend Jax?

02:28.365 --> 02:29.323
- How can I help you,

02:29.366 --> 02:31.760
Baritone Guywhose name escapes me?

02:31.803 --> 02:33.414
- It's Junior.

02:33.457 --> 02:35.024
- Sorry.

02:35.067 --> 02:37.069
- Is Reverend Jax here?

02:37.113 --> 02:39.202
I need to pray with him
about something.

02:39.246 --> 02:41.291
- Well,today is your lucky day

02:41.335 --> 02:44.468
because I am in charge,and instead of just prayer,

02:44.512 --> 02:46.253
we are actually going to solve

02:46.296 --> 02:49.778
one of your problems bytalking it out rationally.

02:49.821 --> 02:51.214
What's your problem?

02:51.258 --> 02:53.477
- I've been feeling
a little down.

02:53.521 --> 02:55.436
Maybe it's just a case
of the Mondays.

02:55.479 --> 02:57.133
- Well, let's explore that.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.352
Why do you dread Mondays?

02:58.395 --> 03:00.484
I'll bet it's the beginningof your work week.

03:00.528 --> 03:01.790
Am I right?
- Yeah.

03:01.833 --> 03:03.270
- And I can see you're wearingorthopedic shoes,

03:03.313 --> 03:04.401
so you're probablyon your feet all day,

03:04.445 --> 03:05.707
so by the time you get home,

03:05.750 --> 03:08.275
you're not only mentally,but physically exhausted.

03:08.318 --> 03:09.711
- Yeah.
- And I can see by all

03:09.754 --> 03:11.800
the diamonds on your weddingband that you really care

03:11.843 --> 03:13.497
about your marriage, but again,by the time you get home,

03:13.541 --> 03:16.500
you're so drained thatyou can't be your best self,

03:16.544 --> 03:19.242
whom I've never met,but I'm sure is delightful.

03:19.286 --> 03:21.853
- Man, you are good.
- Yeah.

03:21.897 --> 03:24.856
I think you need a new job.

03:24.900 --> 03:26.467
- Thank you.
Thank you.

03:26.510 --> 03:28.033
- I'm great at this.

03:29.078 --> 03:30.384
- Hello?
- Oh, Dwayne.

03:30.427 --> 03:32.255
I'm so glad I reached you.

03:32.299 --> 03:34.388
I was supposed to be quickly
dropping off food

03:34.431 --> 03:37.260
at Nazarita's, but she informed
me she's on her death bed...

03:37.304 --> 03:38.261
again.

03:39.958 --> 03:41.046
- I think she just
wants someone

03:41.090 --> 03:42.091
to watch "This Is Us" with,

03:42.134 --> 03:43.745
but I can't take that chance.

03:43.788 --> 03:44.746
Are you free right now?

03:44.789 --> 03:46.835
- Sorry, Reverend Jax.

03:46.878 --> 03:48.271
It's feeding time,

03:48.315 --> 03:50.491
and these little guys
really do rely on me.

03:50.534 --> 03:51.492
- Yeah.
- Hi, Leanne.

03:51.535 --> 03:52.754
I was supposed to be doing

03:52.797 --> 03:54.886
a somewhat delicate
favor for a friend.

03:54.930 --> 03:56.410
I need someone I can trust.

03:56.453 --> 03:58.063
Are you busy?
- I'm sorry.

03:58.107 --> 03:59.630
I'm at an intervention.

03:59.674 --> 04:00.718
- Excuse me?
- Hold on.

04:00.762 --> 04:02.111
Okay, Jayla,

04:02.154 --> 04:05.506
this is how your absencefrom TikTok has affected me.

04:07.464 --> 04:09.510
- Isn't that
for Catholics only?

04:09.553 --> 04:11.294
- That's pretty lucid
for someone on their death bed.

04:11.338 --> 04:13.470
- Yeah.
- Oh, hey, buddy.

04:13.514 --> 04:15.080
I need a really big favor,

04:15.124 --> 04:17.518
but I need you to promise to be
responsible and discreet.

04:17.561 --> 04:19.215
- You came to the right place.

04:19.259 --> 04:23.219
Responsibility
is my middle name.

04:23.263 --> 04:26.701
Actually, it's Campbell.

04:26.744 --> 04:28.572
- Says here it's Anderson.

04:28.616 --> 04:30.922
- Sorry, Officer.Gave you the wrong one.

04:30.966 --> 04:32.707
Here we go.

04:40.758 --> 04:43.457
- Where's Reverend Jax?

04:43.500 --> 04:45.459
- I am Reverend Jax today.

04:45.502 --> 04:46.764
The secular version.

04:46.808 --> 04:48.375
- Oh.

04:48.418 --> 04:50.028
I don't think you can help me.

04:50.072 --> 04:52.248
- Anything a pastor can do,
I can do better.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.554
I should've sung that.

04:53.597 --> 04:55.991
- Great.
Here.

04:56.034 --> 04:57.558
- That's a baby.

04:57.601 --> 04:59.473
- Yeah,Reverend Jax babysits him

04:59.516 --> 05:01.562
when I have a job interview,

05:01.605 --> 05:03.607
so here's his bag with bottles

05:03.651 --> 05:05.609
and diapersand his favorite book.

05:05.653 --> 05:07.481
- That's a lot of diapers.

05:07.524 --> 05:09.178
- Yeah.Oh, and he probably just pooped

05:09.221 --> 05:10.353
right when you took him.

05:10.397 --> 05:12.529
He definitely didn't do itten minutes ago.

05:15.663 --> 05:17.534
- Oh, jeez.

05:19.493 --> 05:21.973
- Yeah, Reverend Jax
was supposed to pick her up,

05:22.017 --> 05:25.455
but he had an emergency,
so he called me.

05:26.500 --> 05:27.544
I was his first choice.

05:27.588 --> 05:29.807
- ID, please.

05:29.851 --> 05:32.506
- I had a better one,
but cop took it away.

05:32.549 --> 05:33.768
You know how that is.

05:33.811 --> 05:36.771
Y'all didn't happen
to clip off any toes, did you?

05:36.814 --> 05:39.426
- No, this was a simpleelective procedure.

05:39.469 --> 05:40.775
But she's been heavily sedated,

05:40.818 --> 05:43.430
so she may not beher usual self.

05:43.473 --> 05:44.996
- Seriously?

05:45.040 --> 05:46.302
This mother?

05:46.346 --> 05:48.652
- Nope.
That's her usual self.

05:49.697 --> 05:50.785
- Ah, jeez, okay.

05:50.828 --> 05:53.396
Let's be rational about this.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.093
What--shh.
What do you want?

05:55.137 --> 05:57.139
What do we got?

05:58.793 --> 06:00.751
"My First Bible."

06:00.795 --> 06:02.797
They start 'em young here.

06:05.452 --> 06:08.846
Peek-a-boo!
It's propaganda.

06:08.890 --> 06:11.414
Are you kidding me?

06:11.458 --> 06:13.285
That's another point for Jax.

06:17.289 --> 06:18.334
- Where is Jax?

06:18.378 --> 06:19.683
Did you kill Jax?

06:19.727 --> 06:21.990
Oh, I hope not.I really like that little dude.

06:22.033 --> 06:24.601
- Jax sent me, okay?

06:24.645 --> 06:26.081
Let's get you home now.

06:26.124 --> 06:28.300
- No, I have got this.

06:28.344 --> 06:29.998
- All right.
- I got it.

06:30.041 --> 06:31.347
Oh.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.915
Get me a chopper out of hereand one anesthesia to go.

06:33.958 --> 06:36.700
- I've got some experiencewrangling inebriates.

06:36.744 --> 06:39.877
All right, well, I'm just gonnahead back to my van.

06:39.921 --> 06:42.053
You know,
the one filled with hot dudes

06:42.097 --> 06:44.578
who aren't afraid
of powerful women?

06:44.621 --> 06:47.537
- They aren't afraid yet.

06:47.581 --> 06:48.930
Oh.

06:48.973 --> 06:53.064
- Yeah, Moses's beard
is soothing for you, isn't it?

06:53.108 --> 06:54.544
Yeah, I got the real deal
right here,

06:54.588 --> 06:55.502
and I'm not
an imaginary person.

06:55.545 --> 06:59.680
- Hey, Arthur.Whoa, you have a baby.

06:59.723 --> 07:01.246
That's fun.

07:01.290 --> 07:02.465
- Hi, Ginny.

07:02.509 --> 07:05.033
What are you doing here
on a Monday?

07:05.076 --> 07:08.123
- Oh, you know, sometimes
I just like to come

07:08.166 --> 07:11.692
and light a candle
and pray for my grandma.

07:11.735 --> 07:13.302
She's not dead.
She's just a really bad person.

07:13.345 --> 07:14.477
- So Jax called you

07:14.521 --> 07:16.697
and told you to check on me,
didn't he?

07:16.740 --> 07:18.525
- Only becausehe has no faith in you,

07:18.568 --> 07:19.569
which is saying something

07:19.613 --> 07:22.485
because he has faithin everybody.

07:22.529 --> 07:26.010
Oh.I remember this age.

07:27.534 --> 07:28.970
Such little feet.

07:29.013 --> 07:30.362
- Yeah, you want to hold him?
- Oh.

07:30.406 --> 07:32.147
- Now you know what you can do?

07:32.190 --> 07:33.627
- I could just eat you up.

07:33.670 --> 07:35.629
- Why don't you
give Jax a call?

07:35.672 --> 07:37.152
Tell him this is the only
kind of babysitting

07:37.195 --> 07:39.720
you need to do.

07:39.763 --> 07:40.764
Whoa.

07:40.808 --> 07:42.070
- Arthur,
what are you doing here?

07:42.113 --> 07:43.724
- Well,
I could ask you the same thing.

07:43.767 --> 07:45.682
Seriously, does nobody
in this town have a job?

07:45.726 --> 07:48.293
- We make soupfor the volunteer firefighters

07:48.337 --> 07:49.860
every month.Did you come to help out?

07:49.904 --> 07:52.776
- No, I'm watching the place
for Jax.

07:52.820 --> 07:54.517
- If Jax isn't here,

07:54.561 --> 07:56.301
does mean we can deviate
from his recipe

07:56.345 --> 07:57.346
and maybe add meat?

07:57.389 --> 07:58.347
- No, we are not--

07:58.390 --> 07:59.609
- Guys, it's one thing to let

07:59.653 --> 08:01.393
the church control
your bedroom behavior,

08:01.437 --> 08:02.917
but don't let them
tell you how to make soup.

08:02.960 --> 08:05.615
Just do whatever you want.

08:07.138 --> 08:08.400
- Oh, God.

08:08.444 --> 08:10.315
What are youths doing here?

08:10.359 --> 08:11.403
- We're the youth group.

08:11.447 --> 08:12.796
We meet oncea week after school.

08:12.840 --> 08:15.146
- Reverend Jax sets up
fun activities for us,

08:15.190 --> 08:16.583
like a Bible-themed escape room

08:16.626 --> 08:17.758
where we use
teamwork and prayer

08:17.801 --> 08:18.976
to help ourselves
get out of the room.

08:19.020 --> 08:20.891
- That's not gonna happen.

08:20.935 --> 08:22.023
- Well,
should we study scripture?

08:22.066 --> 08:24.416
- I wouldn't.

08:24.460 --> 08:27.594
But, hey, look,
there's a computer machine.

08:27.637 --> 08:29.900
The world is at our fingertips.

08:29.944 --> 08:30.988

♪ Love scars!

08:52.401 --> 08:53.924
- All right, well,
that's not what we're hearing,

08:53.968 --> 08:56.710
so I'm just gonna
turn this off.

08:56.753 --> 08:59.364
- I honestly...

08:59.408 --> 09:00.583
cannot feel the drugs.

09:00.627 --> 09:02.672
Did they not give me drugs?

09:02.716 --> 09:05.632
I will sue them.

09:05.675 --> 09:08.722
What is this sash?

09:08.765 --> 09:10.027
Is it for a pageant?

09:10.071 --> 09:12.813
- Yep, your talent was
giving a bloody nose

09:12.856 --> 09:15.598
to a guy who was just trying
to help you put on a seatbelt.

09:15.642 --> 09:16.686
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

09:16.730 --> 09:19.254
My talent is producing the most

09:19.297 --> 09:21.996

09:22.039 --> 09:23.258
- All right, we get it.

09:23.301 --> 09:25.869
You own a factory farm,
everyone's dream.

09:25.913 --> 09:30.178
- No, no, I went to the clinicto have my eggs frozen.

09:33.094 --> 09:34.269
- All right, hold on,
this is getting serious.

09:34.312 --> 09:35.836
I don't like this.

09:35.879 --> 09:39.056
Go back to the sash stuff,
something about a pageant.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.276
- I just want to keepmy options open.

09:43.800 --> 09:46.673
- Well, that was very personal,
and...

09:46.716 --> 09:50.111
I'm honored that you felt
comfortable enough to tell me.

09:50.154 --> 09:52.069
- Usually I don't get thischatty with my limo driver.

09:52.113 --> 09:54.898
Can you believe they triedto send Wayne to pick me up?

09:56.117 --> 09:57.248
- All right, well,

09:57.292 --> 09:59.076
it was a nice moment
while it lasted.

10:00.774 --> 10:01.905
- I'm gonna put
the radio back on.

10:01.949 --> 10:05.866
- ♪ Hear what I want to

10:05.909 --> 10:07.868

Seem to have
everything under control.

10:09.826 --> 10:11.045
- Hm.

10:11.088 --> 10:12.786
- You changed his diaper,
right?

10:12.829 --> 10:13.830
- Yeah.

10:13.874 --> 10:16.224
God, I do not miss that.

10:16.267 --> 10:18.443
But watching a baby sleep,

10:18.487 --> 10:21.795
for one moment,all is right in the world.

10:21.838 --> 10:23.100
- What the hell
did you tell my husband

10:23.144 --> 10:24.493
to make him act so crazy?

10:24.536 --> 10:26.103
- Real quick,
she's not in the choir, right?

10:26.147 --> 10:27.714
- That's Junior's wife, Barb.

10:27.757 --> 10:28.932
She's a drinker.

10:28.976 --> 10:30.934
- Ugh, that poor man.
He's always on the edge.

10:30.978 --> 10:31.935
- All right, all right.

10:31.979 --> 10:32.675
- Why are you tryingto push him off?

10:32.719 --> 10:33.676
- Okay, calm down.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.069
Your husband came in here

10:35.112 --> 10:36.374
with a case of the Mondays.

10:36.418 --> 10:37.898
I'm sure he didn't do
anything drastic.

10:37.941 --> 10:39.639
- He's saying
he wants to quit his job.

10:41.771 --> 10:43.555
- Would you like a drink?

10:43.599 --> 10:44.905
- He says he's gonnamove us to Tennessee.

10:44.948 --> 10:46.254
Tennessee.

10:46.297 --> 10:48.560
- Are people from Kentucky
under the impression

10:48.604 --> 10:49.953
that other states are worse?

10:49.997 --> 10:51.389
- Hey, Barb, don't worry.

10:51.433 --> 10:53.478
Reverend Jax will be here soon,
and he will help you.

10:53.522 --> 10:54.828
- No, we don't need
Reverend Jax.

10:54.871 --> 10:55.872
I will talk to your husband.

10:55.916 --> 10:57.091
- He should not belistening to you.

10:57.134 --> 10:58.309
He should belistening to God.

10:58.353 --> 10:59.963
- No, he should be
listening to you.

11:00.007 --> 11:01.704
You seem like a strong woman

11:01.748 --> 11:03.184
who knows exactly
what she wants,

11:03.227 --> 11:04.838
if your hair,
makeup,

11:04.881 --> 11:08.189
and nail choices
are any indication.

11:09.364 --> 11:10.582
- These colors never run.

11:10.626 --> 11:11.845
- No, they do not.

11:11.888 --> 11:13.977
You need to show
your husband who's boss.

11:14.021 --> 11:16.806
And women have
a very special secret weapon.

11:16.850 --> 11:18.852
Don't they, Barb?

11:18.895 --> 11:20.070
- I like the way you think.

11:20.114 --> 11:21.245
- Yeah.

11:22.464 --> 11:24.771
I do, too.

11:26.468 --> 11:27.861
Okay, youth group.

11:27.904 --> 11:29.123
I am on a hot streak--

11:29.166 --> 11:30.298
oh, God.

11:30.341 --> 11:32.779
- Hey, don't takethe Lord's name in vain.

11:32.822 --> 11:35.651
- You're looking at porn
on a church computer.

11:35.695 --> 11:36.652
- Well, how else
are we supposed to learn

11:36.696 --> 11:37.958
about this stuff?

11:38.001 --> 11:39.611
- I asked my parentsto give me a book about it,

11:39.655 --> 11:40.612
and they gave me the Bible.

11:40.656 --> 11:41.918
- Oh, jeez.

11:41.962 --> 11:44.529
- And then they took the lock
off of my bedroom door.

11:44.573 --> 11:47.968
- Okay, let's approach this
with science and reason

11:48.011 --> 11:49.796
instead of fear and shame.

11:51.014 --> 11:52.929
- What's the dealwith nipple clamps?

11:52.973 --> 11:55.323
- Uh...

11:55.366 --> 11:58.239
parts of the body...

11:58.282 --> 12:00.763
nerves cluster.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.983
Give me--I'm gonna just...

12:03.026 --> 12:05.594
a little...

12:05.637 --> 12:08.640
sustenance in communion wine.

12:11.469 --> 12:13.558
- So as you can see, guys,

12:13.602 --> 12:15.778
it's a lot more complicated
than just third base.

12:15.822 --> 12:17.606
- Do you know the baby's name?

12:17.649 --> 12:20.130
I've been calling him Steve.

12:20.174 --> 12:22.829
Oh, my God, Steve, look away.

12:22.872 --> 12:24.047
- What a weird place to pause.

12:24.091 --> 12:27.050
Probably just looks familiar,
though, to him.

12:27.094 --> 12:29.139
But otherwise, we've been
having an enlightening

12:29.183 --> 12:31.663
discussion of the rich tapestry

12:31.707 --> 12:34.014
that is human sexuality,
haven't we, guys?

12:34.057 --> 12:35.842
- You can't talk
about that stuff.

12:35.885 --> 12:36.843
- Why not?
I'm perfect.

12:36.886 --> 12:38.148
If not me, who?

12:38.192 --> 12:40.237
- Anyone but the weird guy
in the scarf they just met.

12:40.281 --> 12:41.586
- Oh, please.

12:41.630 --> 12:43.893
- Guys, just because
someone is in a church

12:43.937 --> 12:45.503
does not mean
you have to listen to him.

12:45.547 --> 12:48.898
- Exactly.
That's another point for me.

12:50.508 --> 12:53.860
- Mama's home
and she missed her babies.

12:53.903 --> 12:54.991
- Man...

12:55.035 --> 12:57.864

13:15.446 --> 13:16.404

13:16.447 --> 13:18.928
Now get me one of my furs,

13:18.972 --> 13:20.321
and I'll be through with you.

13:20.364 --> 13:23.977
- Hmm, feels a little weird
to leave you alone this wasted.

13:24.020 --> 13:27.632
You got a lot of sharp corners
and fragile-looking things.

13:27.676 --> 13:29.983
- Fine,
but if I have to be wasted,

13:30.026 --> 13:31.071
so do you.

13:31.114 --> 13:32.072
It's only fair.

13:48.958 --> 13:51.004
- Yeah, sure,
talking sense into people

13:51.047 --> 13:53.093
seems to be my thing today.
What's happening?

13:53.136 --> 13:55.008
- She tried to hand
me beef broth

13:55.051 --> 13:56.879
in a veggie broth can.

13:56.923 --> 13:59.055
- Sorry if I don't want to set

14:01.014 --> 14:02.493

17:10.942 --> 17:11.987
- You know what?

17:12.031 --> 17:13.293
I'm looking
for a fire extinguisher.

17:13.336 --> 17:15.121
- Were you teaching
our sons about sex?

17:15.164 --> 17:16.078
- They're supposed
to learn about that

17:16.122 --> 17:18.080
by watching a hard PG-13.

17:18.124 --> 17:19.342
- Look, situation happening.

17:19.386 --> 17:21.649
I'm just looking
for a fire extinguisher.

17:21.692 --> 17:24.086
- Shh!
It's just a loud noise.

17:24.130 --> 17:28.351
Do you want to hold my hand?

17:28.395 --> 17:30.962
- ♪ Ooh, ooh,
love hurts ♪

17:31.006 --> 17:33.095
- All right, Lord.

17:33.139 --> 17:34.357
Show me what you got.

17:34.401 --> 17:37.360
- ♪ Ooh, ooh,
love hurts ♪

17:37.404 --> 17:39.667
- They looked to the desert

17:39.710 --> 17:44.933
where the Lord
appeared glorious

17:44.976 --> 17:48.023
in the clouds?

17:48.067 --> 17:50.286
Seriously?

17:50.330 --> 17:51.679
- Hello, Arthur.

17:51.722 --> 17:54.725
What the H
did you do to my church?

18:06.433 --> 18:09.349
I feel like
I been run over by a truck.

18:09.392 --> 18:11.960
And I've been
run over by a truck.

18:12.003 --> 18:14.267
- The last time
I was this hung over

18:14.310 --> 18:16.486
was the day after my wedding.

18:16.530 --> 18:18.532
We had a gas leak
at the reception.

18:20.447 --> 18:23.406
- Oh, man, I can't believeit's still today.

18:23.450 --> 18:24.494
- I can't believe
what you have to go through

18:24.538 --> 18:27.845
to freeze your eggs.

18:27.889 --> 18:30.283
- At least you're planning.

18:30.326 --> 18:33.938
For me, I forget to weara condom 16 times,

18:33.982 --> 18:35.984
and boom.A baby.

18:37.986 --> 18:41.424
Guess it's no wonder I wound upbeing such a lousy dad.

18:41.468 --> 18:42.773
- No.

18:42.817 --> 18:45.167
You are there for Cash.

18:45.211 --> 18:47.038
You're in his life a lot.

18:47.082 --> 18:48.866
And I know it can't be easy
to be around Ginny

18:48.910 --> 18:51.608
after she broke your heart.

18:51.652 --> 18:53.523
- Thanks, Adams.

18:53.567 --> 18:54.785
Always thoughtyou kind of hated me.

18:54.829 --> 18:56.961
Thought I was bad for Ginny,

18:57.005 --> 18:59.399
seeing as yousaid it to my face.

18:59.442 --> 19:00.748
More than once.

19:00.791 --> 19:04.752
- You showed up
when it counted.

19:04.795 --> 19:07.320
- When you're in needof Wayne Hawlings,

19:07.363 --> 19:08.321
he is there for you.

19:10.888 --> 19:13.195
Crap.

19:13.239 --> 19:16.111
I was supposed to bea pallbearer an hour ago.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.200
Oh, well.Next time.

19:21.029 --> 19:24.380
- I feel like we're sitting
outside the principal's office.

19:24.424 --> 19:27.253
- I never got called into the
principal's office growing up.

19:27.296 --> 19:31.474
But he did driveby my house an awful lot.

19:31.518 --> 19:33.259
- I understand
your job is stressful,

19:33.302 --> 19:35.348
even if it is
working in an ice cream shop.

19:35.391 --> 19:37.437
- And I understand
you hate Tennessee,

19:37.480 --> 19:38.873
even though
my great uncle's mansion

19:38.916 --> 19:40.440
is just sitting there empty.

19:40.483 --> 19:41.876
- Thank you for praying
that out with me, everyone.

19:41.919 --> 19:43.269
And, Barb,
don't worry about the lamp.

19:43.312 --> 19:45.488
I was planning
on smashing that anyway.

19:45.532 --> 19:48.099
- Reverend Jax, would you
please take the baby back?

19:48.143 --> 19:50.667
- Not yet, and just remember,if you're not responsible,

19:50.711 --> 19:53.931
your whole life will be spentwatching one of these.

19:53.975 --> 19:55.629
Arthur, a word?

19:55.672 --> 19:57.065
- Are you gonna gloat, Rev?

19:57.108 --> 19:58.240
Because you deserve it.

19:58.284 --> 20:01.374
It was very impressive the way
you put out those fires,

20:01.417 --> 20:02.810
including the literal one.

20:02.853 --> 20:06.292
- Don't thank me.Thank the big guy.

20:06.335 --> 20:08.685
George William Manby, inventorof the fire extinguisher.

20:08.729 --> 20:10.470
- Uh, guys?

20:10.513 --> 20:12.254
We've got 20 hungry
firefighters coming,

20:12.298 --> 20:13.951
and nothing to feed them.

20:13.995 --> 20:16.171
- Well,I'm sure the Lord will provide.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.434
- No.
I got this one, Rev.

20:21.176 --> 20:24.527
Well, I helped the way
the secular elites always do.

20:24.571 --> 20:27.487
- By being smug
and starting a podcast?

20:27.530 --> 20:29.315
- No, I gave money.

20:29.358 --> 20:30.446
- And everyone is so happy.

20:30.490 --> 20:32.622
- There you people are.
Where is my baby?

20:32.666 --> 20:33.884
- Oops.
Sorry.

20:33.928 --> 20:35.059
Perhaps we should've
left a note.

20:35.103 --> 20:36.322
- Oh, Steve.

20:36.365 --> 20:38.498
- Steve.I'm psychic.

20:38.541 --> 20:40.978
- By the way,
I got the job.

20:41.022 --> 20:43.067
Thanks.

20:43.111 --> 20:45.287
- You're welcome.

20:45.331 --> 20:46.375
- You see?

20:46.419 --> 20:47.898
You did morethan just give money.

20:47.942 --> 20:50.510
You still think the churchshould've shut its doors?

20:50.553 --> 20:55.166
- Rev, I don't believe
in "the church," but...

20:55.210 --> 20:57.386
I do believe in your church.

20:58.779 --> 20:59.997
Ooh.

21:00.041 --> 21:02.522
- Oh, so Wayne was partof the secret adventure?

21:02.565 --> 21:05.394
- Oh, you two missed out
on a big day.

21:05.438 --> 21:06.482
Karla and I made soup--

21:06.526 --> 21:07.657
- That's how you're tellingthat story?

21:07.701 --> 21:09.790
- I'm not telling
that story right.

21:09.833 --> 21:12.401
- Hey, where were you guys?

21:12.445 --> 21:13.402
- Let them thinkwhat they want.

21:13.446 --> 21:15.578
Your secret's safe with me.

21:15.622 --> 21:18.364
- I had my eggs frozen.
No further questions.

21:18.407 --> 21:19.365
Thank you.

21:19.408 --> 21:21.236
I can't have themthinking we hang out.

21:21.280 --> 21:24.195
You understand?

21:24.239 --> 21:25.284
- Sad part is I do.
