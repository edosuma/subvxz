E. R.

00:06.401 --> 00:07.600
Previously on E. R.

00:07.601 --> 00:09.872
I was hoping you'd give me the joy...

00:09.973 --> 00:12.573
and honor of being your husband.

00:12.574 --> 00:16.597
- I can't find a decent position.
- Stay local, or you give up custody.

00:16.598 --> 00:18.657
I am willing to offer you
a per diem position.

00:19.837 --> 00:20.985
- Per diem?
- Yeah.

00:20.986 --> 00:22.186
Give me the purse!

00:28.802 --> 00:31.195
Stop! Luka, stop!

00:31.781 --> 00:33.172
Stop it!

E. R. 7x05 "FIGHT OF FANCY"

00:52.187 --> 00:56.516
What can I tell you? I'm short-staffed,
okay? I can't go on a transport.

00:56.691 --> 00:58.850
Conni, can you clear
this TIA in 6?

00:59.027 --> 01:01.399
- She's waiting for her daughter.
- That's what Chairs are for.

01:01.571 --> 01:03.860
And give a gram of Unasyn
to the dog bite in 4.

01:04.032 --> 01:05.906
Mark, they need you at the MICN.

01:06.075 --> 01:08.364
Try Mercy Air.
Maybe they can pick him up.

01:08.536 --> 01:12.035
Paramedics have a guy with chest pain.
Won't get in the ambulance.

01:12.206 --> 01:16.038
Well, explain the risks and make sure
he signs out AMA. What are his vitals?

01:16.210 --> 01:19.544
- He's refusing to sign the form.
- Mark, you gave my patient cefoxitin?

01:19.714 --> 01:22.169
- Who?
- Bovard. Appy.

01:22.341 --> 01:25.295
Hold on. Yeah.
Listen, he needed antibiotics.

01:25.469 --> 01:28.304
- Yeah. Cefotetan's a better drug.
- Peter, I'm a little busy.

01:28.472 --> 01:30.797
That's not my problem.
You should have called me.

01:30.975 --> 01:34.094
- Did you get through?
- No answer. I stat-paged him twice.

01:34.269 --> 01:37.187
Well, try his cell phone.
Any response to Lasix?

01:37.356 --> 01:38.898
Mark, the AMA.

01:39.066 --> 01:41.521
Get him on the radio
and try and convince him.

01:41.693 --> 01:42.856
What about a nitro drip?

01:43.028 --> 01:46.361
I need you to buff up a recurrent
bowel obstruction I have on the way.

01:46.531 --> 01:47.694
What are we? Jiffy Lube?

01:47.866 --> 01:50.820
I need a sugar-tong splint in 3.
Kovac still MIA?

01:50.994 --> 01:53.402
- Kovac missed his shift?
- I'm sure he's on his way.

01:53.580 --> 01:55.371
- Where's Kerry?
- It's her day off.

01:55.540 --> 01:59.288
- She's at a chrysanthemum show.
- Great, she's off playing Martha Stewart.

01:59.461 --> 02:01.120
Hold on. Just a sec. I'm sorry.

02:01.296 --> 02:04.546
I've got a helicopter transport.
We're gonna have to call in backup.

02:04.716 --> 02:07.171
Why don't you wait until 8:30?
He's never late.

02:07.343 --> 02:10.130
- Peter, what's this?
- Hot appy. O.R.'s ready.

02:10.304 --> 02:12.878
Great. I'll take him.
Dr. Greene needs your help here.

02:13.057 --> 02:15.726
- Trauma coming in?
- No. You're gonna cover the whole ER.

02:15.893 --> 02:17.933
- What?
- Yep. This'll get you started.

02:18.104 --> 02:20.725
Diarrhea, ear pain
and weak and dizzy all over.

02:20.898 --> 02:24.231
Wait a minute. "Weak and dizzy"
wasn't part of our per-diem agreement.

02:24.401 --> 02:27.106
Sure it is. Per diem means
"per my discretion."

02:27.279 --> 02:29.438
Okay. I'm on my way.

02:29.615 --> 02:32.022
I haven't done primary care
since med school.

02:32.201 --> 02:35.285
Don't worry, Peter. You just
gotta cover until Kovac gets here.

02:35.454 --> 02:36.734
When's that?

02:36.914 --> 02:41.540
I hope soon. Andrazak in 4,
check his lytes in an hour.

02:41.710 --> 02:44.876
And look at a post-reduction
shoulder film on Quintano.

02:45.046 --> 02:46.873
- How long's your flight?
- I don't know.

02:47.048 --> 02:49.622
- Where you going?
- Grass Creek, Indiana.

02:49.801 --> 02:52.126
The wedding coordinator's coming
at noon.

02:52.303 --> 02:55.637
- I know.
- Mark, we canceled her once already.

02:55.807 --> 02:57.930
Go ahead and talk to her.
You can handle it.

02:58.101 --> 03:02.976
I don't want to. I want you to share in
kinds of invitations, menus, flowers...

03:03.147 --> 03:07.524
- I know. I'm stuck. I'm sorry.
- Well, at least try to get back on time.

03:07.693 --> 03:09.650
I'll call you.

03:09.820 --> 03:11.813
- Have a safe flight!
- What?

03:11.989 --> 03:13.531
Nothing!

03:23.042 --> 03:27.122
Lifeguard Five-Seven-David.
Landing-pad zone is clear. Over.

03:28.088 --> 03:30.128
E. R.

04:19.221 --> 04:22.222
All right, I've got the earache.

04:22.391 --> 04:23.636
That's a Pedes case.

04:23.809 --> 04:27.059
Yeah. Well, Romano has me seeing
everything today.

04:27.229 --> 04:29.601
And that's a complete waste
of your brilliance.

04:29.773 --> 04:33.557
I've apologized. If you can't accept it,
let's call a truce so we can work.

04:33.735 --> 04:36.985
You are amazing. First, you dump me.
Then you expect me-

04:37.155 --> 04:39.563
- I did not dump you.
- Then what do you call it?

04:39.741 --> 04:42.742
You were going to move to Philadelphia
without saying a word.

04:42.911 --> 04:46.362
But I didn't, did I? I stayed here,
and I took this damn per diem job.

04:46.539 --> 04:51.746
And I'm supposed to believe you did
that for me? That's what I thought.

04:53.671 --> 04:57.882
Hi. I'm Dr. Benton.
So, Jason...

04:58.050 --> 04:59.710
How long has he been sick?

04:59.885 --> 05:02.839
It started last week with an earache.
And then he had a fever.

05:03.013 --> 05:04.389
- Okay.
- Now he's coughing.

05:04.557 --> 05:07.474
- Let's take a look here.
- You don't think he's got pneumonia?

05:07.643 --> 05:09.600
- One thing at a time.
- Get away from me!

05:09.770 --> 05:12.937
Jason. Be nice.
The doctor wants to help you.

05:13.649 --> 05:14.929
I said, be nice.

05:15.109 --> 05:19.236
All right, Jason. Look, this isn't
gonna hurt, okay?

05:19.404 --> 05:21.730
- Just be still. Here we go.
- No! I wanna go home!

05:21.907 --> 05:24.232
It's okay. It's not gonna hurt.
Jason!

05:24.409 --> 05:26.865
That's right, Jason. Go to Mommy.

05:28.455 --> 05:31.409
Why don't you put him on your lap
and give him a nice big hug?

05:31.583 --> 05:35.663
And if Jason's real still,
I'm going to give him a sticker.

05:35.837 --> 05:37.082
- How are his sats?
- Up to 98.

05:37.338 --> 05:40.588
- His ejection fraction's less than 10%.
- Mr. Coggins?

05:40.758 --> 05:42.466
- Call me Tom.
- I'm Mark Greene.

05:42.635 --> 05:44.509
We're gonna lie you down
to load you on.

05:44.679 --> 05:46.802
I'm gonna miss the scenery.

05:46.973 --> 05:48.633
- What's his BP?
-90/70.

05:48.808 --> 05:52.592
It's always that low. There's not much
heart muscle. Can you keep trying Janet?

05:52.770 --> 05:53.801
Sure, Tom.

05:53.980 --> 05:56.601
That's my fiancée. She's flying in
from Montreal today.

05:56.774 --> 05:59.312
Let me know if you feel dizzy
or get short of breath.

05:59.485 --> 06:02.236
I'm okay as long as I lie still.

06:02.404 --> 06:05.773
Bright side is, I get bumped up
on the transplant list, right?

06:05.949 --> 06:08.950
- Gordon, how are we for oxygen?
- Four E cylinders, all full.

06:09.119 --> 06:12.155
Ready? Let's go. One, two, three.

06:12.331 --> 06:17.206
Full trauma panel. Type and cross for
eight. Get the bypass team on standby.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.378
- Somebody stabbed him?
- No. He tripped near a pencil sharpener.

06:20.547 --> 06:24.165
Our office manager wanted to pull it
out. But I wouldn't let him.

06:24.342 --> 06:26.916
Decreased breath sounds.
Set me up with a chest tube.

06:27.095 --> 06:28.506
- I'll do it.
- No, I'll do it.

06:28.680 --> 06:30.554
Excuse me. This is a teaching hospital.

06:30.723 --> 06:33.724
Exactly. Go find another patient
to learn on.

06:34.727 --> 06:38.310
- Pulse ox down to 91.
- Okay. Let's get one percent with epi.

06:38.481 --> 06:41.186
Peter, heard you had a good one.
And indeed you do.

06:41.359 --> 06:43.850
- He needs a CT. Let me get a 10 blade.
- Don't bother.

06:44.028 --> 06:46.234
I'll throw the tube in
and take him to the OR.

06:46.405 --> 06:48.279
Don't worry.
You are in excellent hands.

06:48.449 --> 06:50.738
- It's okay. I've got this.
- This is a surgical case.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.653
You are an ER doctor today.
Remember?

06:52.828 --> 06:56.873
There's a guy puking out in the hall.
Go see what you can do. Excuse me.

06:57.958 --> 07:00.994
I need a 32 French tube,
some 0 silk and Xeroforms...

07:01.170 --> 07:02.878
Sir, are you okay?

07:03.046 --> 07:05.716
- What does it look like?
- Can we get some Compazine here?

07:05.883 --> 07:07.959
Sir, you're gonna have to aim
for the basin.

07:08.135 --> 07:12.382
- I heard it. But I didn't believe it.
- Carter, get me some gloves.

07:12.556 --> 07:15.889
Dr. Peter Benton, ER Attending.
Has kind of a nice ring to it.

07:16.059 --> 07:17.850
- You want this?
- Oh, no. No, no.

07:18.019 --> 07:20.308
Looks like you're doing just fine.

07:21.981 --> 07:24.935
Trent? I'm Dr. Carter.
What happened to your hand?

07:25.110 --> 07:29.439
I have this stupid art class.
We were carving some duck decoy.

07:30.031 --> 07:34.075
The most exciting thing that we ever
did, I think, was macramé.

07:34.660 --> 07:37.946
- How many stitches do you think?
- How many do you want?

07:38.122 --> 07:40.791
- Enough to get me out of art class.
- Ten ought to do it.

07:40.958 --> 07:43.994
- Dr. Carter, can you step out a second?
- After I suture this.

07:44.170 --> 07:46.328
No. It's important.

07:47.089 --> 07:50.292
I'll be right back.
Don't pick your nose.

07:51.510 --> 07:53.752
- What?
- His grandmother wants to talk with you.

07:53.929 --> 07:57.843
- Well, just bring her in.
- No. She asked to see you alone.

07:58.767 --> 08:00.510
Hello. I'm Dr. Carter.

08:00.686 --> 08:03.390
I'm sorry. I came as soon as I could.
Is Trent all right?

08:03.563 --> 08:06.434
Just a few stitches.
He'll be good as new.

08:07.275 --> 08:10.312
Doctor, there's something
you need to know.

08:10.779 --> 08:15.441
Trent's mother died of AIDS when
he was 2. He tested HIV-positive.

08:15.617 --> 08:17.942
- You need to be careful.
- He didn't say anything.

08:18.119 --> 08:20.788
He doesn't know. We never told him.

08:20.955 --> 08:23.114
- What?
- We just wanted him to be normal...

08:23.291 --> 08:24.785
...like other kids.

08:24.959 --> 08:28.209
- What about the medications?
- He thinks he has a vitamin deficiency.

08:28.379 --> 08:31.962
- And your doctor plays along with that?
- Well, he understands.

08:32.633 --> 08:34.126
Trent needs to know.

08:34.302 --> 08:37.219
Yes. When he's older.
When he can better understand.

08:37.388 --> 08:39.380
Your grandson could be sexually active.

08:39.557 --> 08:44.432
- He's not. I've asked him.
- Are you sure he's telling the truth?

08:44.603 --> 08:46.892
Doctor, I know my grandson. You don't.

08:47.064 --> 08:50.647
Mrs. Larson, I have a legal right
to tell Trent that he's HIV-positive.

08:50.818 --> 08:54.815
- You have no right to interfere.
- HIV is a sexually transmitted disease.

08:54.988 --> 08:58.653
And if he's having unprotected sex,
he could be putting others at risk.

08:58.825 --> 09:01.862
- Well, I think we better leave.
- Well, he can't leave.

09:02.037 --> 09:03.151
- Let me by.
- Chris?

09:03.330 --> 09:06.414
- Let me by!
- Could you escort Mrs. Larson to Chairs?

09:06.583 --> 09:08.825
- This way, ma'am.
- Don't touch me.

09:09.002 --> 09:10.959
Don't do this.

09:14.132 --> 09:17.382
Pulse ox 94 on two liters.

09:17.844 --> 09:20.169
What's your hurry?

09:20.680 --> 09:23.385
You keep checking your watch
every 10 seconds.

09:23.558 --> 09:26.131
- I'm just charting.
- I don't think so.

09:26.519 --> 09:31.145
- You late for something?
- I'm supposed to meet my fiancée.

09:31.315 --> 09:34.435
- You got a lunch date?
- We're meeting the wedding planner.

09:34.944 --> 09:38.194
You're taking the plunge.
It's a great feeling.

09:38.364 --> 09:41.697
Yeah. What's your fiancée's name again?

09:42.201 --> 09:44.110
Janet.

09:44.870 --> 09:49.117
I'm calling the ER. See if they can get
ahold of her, and she can meet us there.

09:49.291 --> 09:51.497
That'd be great.

09:51.960 --> 09:56.005
Hi, Randi? It's Mark Greene up in
the helicopter. Who's around?

09:56.465 --> 09:58.374
Dr. Corday's right here.
It's Dr. Greene.

09:58.550 --> 10:00.127
I need to speak to him right away.

10:00.302 --> 10:02.175
- Is everything all right?
- Dr. Dietrich?

10:02.345 --> 10:07.387
This is Dr. Carter at County. I repaired
a laceration on your patient, Trent Larson.

10:07.559 --> 10:11.603
- I'll try and get ahold of her.
- No, he's a great kid.

10:11.771 --> 10:15.306
Listen, if I was to get a needle-stick,
is there anything I should know?

10:15.483 --> 10:18.567
- Did you get in touch with that hotel?
- There's still no answer.

10:18.736 --> 10:22.354
Could you call the manager and see
if they can send somebody up there?

10:28.704 --> 10:30.282
Detective?

10:31.499 --> 10:34.583
You keep coming by, I'm gonna
have to get you a badge and a gun.

10:34.752 --> 10:37.124
So, is there anything...?

10:37.296 --> 10:41.958
Dr. Kovac, now, you know the minute
there's anything new, I'm gonna call you.

10:42.134 --> 10:47.009
We take photos for the medical record.
I thought it might help.

10:47.264 --> 10:50.763
His morgue photo's already
on the police bulletin.

10:50.934 --> 10:53.935
Maybe you could go back to where
it happened, show this around?

10:54.104 --> 10:57.307
We've done our interviews, doc.
No one knows him.

10:57.482 --> 10:59.439
What about fingerprints?

10:59.609 --> 11:02.230
Have a seat. Have a seat, doc.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.741
Look, I understand how you feel, okay?

11:11.913 --> 11:16.621
But the fact is, you're probably
better off if no one IDs this guy.

11:16.792 --> 11:21.371
No one's gonna come crawling out of the
woodwork with a wrongful death suit.

11:21.547 --> 11:25.082
I don't care. I just need to know
who he was.

11:26.719 --> 11:30.551
Take my advice, doc.
You were defending yourself.

11:31.015 --> 11:34.218
Dedicate yourself to believing that.

11:35.394 --> 11:39.261
- All right. Keep that clean and dry.
- All right. Cool.

11:39.439 --> 11:42.808
Hey, Dr. Carter,
is my grandmother here yet?

11:42.984 --> 11:46.484
Yeah. But first we need to talk.

11:47.531 --> 11:49.986
Why? It's just a cut.

11:50.659 --> 11:53.909
Yeah, actually, I need
to ask you something.

11:54.079 --> 11:55.822
All right.

11:58.666 --> 12:03.328
It's about your mother. How much
do you remember about her?

12:03.504 --> 12:06.956
- Nothing.
- You sure?

12:07.133 --> 12:11.344
Yeah. She's dead. She was a loser.
A heroin addict.

12:12.346 --> 12:16.675
She died of AIDS. And she had the virus
when she was pregnant with you.

12:16.851 --> 12:21.477
And the virus can pass
from the mother to the baby.

12:23.816 --> 12:26.022
Wait a second. So...

12:26.944 --> 12:28.853
- I have AIDS?
- No. You have HIV.

12:29.029 --> 12:33.442
And you're healthy
because you've been taking medication.

12:34.701 --> 12:37.702
No, no. See, I just take
a bunch of vitamins. That's it.

12:37.871 --> 12:41.703
No. You've been taking medication
to combat the virus.

12:42.542 --> 12:44.416
No. They're just vitamins, man.

12:44.586 --> 12:48.121
No. Your grandmother told me.
And I confirmed it with your doctor.

12:50.884 --> 12:53.291
Why wouldn't she tell me?!

12:54.470 --> 12:57.886
I think she wanted to protect you.

12:59.809 --> 13:01.848
But you need to know.

13:05.982 --> 13:09.018
So my whole life everybody's lied to me.

13:11.362 --> 13:13.769
I'm not lying to you.

13:17.242 --> 13:19.116
How much longer do you think?

13:19.286 --> 13:20.828
Gordon, what's our ETA?

13:20.996 --> 13:24.745
Well, there's the Kankakee River.
About 20 minutes.

13:27.753 --> 13:29.911
You all right?

13:30.714 --> 13:33.584
It's all right. Just a little
chest pain. I'll be okay.

13:33.758 --> 13:35.087
Nitro spray.

13:35.594 --> 13:37.717
Open your mouth, under your tongue.

13:38.597 --> 13:41.597
On a scale of one to 10,
how bad is the pain?

13:41.766 --> 13:43.759
Big-time ST elevation on the monitor.

13:46.146 --> 13:49.016
Find the tenecteplase.
I'll do the heparin.

13:51.567 --> 13:54.058
- What's going on?
- You're having a heart attack.

13:54.237 --> 13:56.906
But we're giving you
clot-busting medicine.

13:57.073 --> 14:00.074
Pulse ox down to 82.
You want to intubate?

14:01.661 --> 14:04.198
Not if I don't have to.

14:04.372 --> 14:06.245
Let's get him on a mask.
15 liters.

14:06.415 --> 14:09.784
- Maybe we should land.
- No. Doctor Greene...

14:10.252 --> 14:13.288
Dr. Greene, you'll get me there, right?

14:14.465 --> 14:16.956
Yeah. I'll get you there.

14:19.428 --> 14:21.753
Do you have a girlfriend?

14:21.930 --> 14:25.975
Because if you've slept with anybody,
they'll have to be tested.

14:27.144 --> 14:31.141
It's important, Trent.
You have to use condoms.

14:33.817 --> 14:37.565
- Can I go now?
- Yeah.

14:37.737 --> 14:39.896
Yep, your grandmother's waiting.

14:40.073 --> 14:44.651
So a case manager's gonna phone you
tomorrow, see how you're doing.

14:44.827 --> 14:48.030
And you've got an appointment
next week with the teen HIV center.

14:48.206 --> 14:51.740
And you can always reach me here.
The ER always knows where to find me.

14:51.918 --> 14:53.875
- All right.
- All right?

14:55.630 --> 14:57.207
Trent?

14:59.008 --> 15:01.250
Thank you, doctor.

15:15.148 --> 15:20.439

15:29.371 --> 15:30.948
Just that one.

15:31.122 --> 15:34.408
After teaching English for 10 years,
I know them all.

15:34.584 --> 15:38.083
- It looks like you' re feeling better.
- ST segments are back down.

15:40.798 --> 15:45.840
Hello? Yeah, we're about
five minutes out.

15:46.429 --> 15:49.632
That's good. Hold on.
Janet's on her way in.

15:49.807 --> 15:50.922
Thank you.

15:51.100 --> 15:53.057
Listen, we're gonna need
a gurney and-

15:53.227 --> 15:54.258
What the hell's that?

15:57.314 --> 16:00.766
The main rotor. I got metal fragments
in the gearbox.

16:00.943 --> 16:02.770
- What's wrong?
- Mark!

16:02.945 --> 16:04.522
Mark, are you there? Mark?

16:04.696 --> 16:10.450
Mayday, mayday. This is Lifeguard
Nine-Seven-Kilo on emergency descent.

16:10.619 --> 16:14.118
- Cinch him in tight.
- I'm gonna shut down for auto rotation.

16:14.289 --> 16:16.661
No, no. We're gonna make it.

16:17.959 --> 16:19.453
Mark? Can you hear me?

16:19.628 --> 16:21.252
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

16:21.421 --> 16:24.126
There were horns, shouting.
Now there's nothing. Mark!

16:24.299 --> 16:28.131
VFR position. Industrial area.

16:28.303 --> 16:30.876
Scrap yard near 95th
and Commercial.

16:31.055 --> 16:35.801
When I get enough rotor speed, I'll pull
on the pitch to cushion our landing.

16:35.977 --> 16:38.135
- We're falling.
- Hang in there, Tom.

16:48.697 --> 16:49.777
Here we go.

16:55.204 --> 16:56.912
Okay. Everybody out.

16:58.916 --> 17:00.742
Get out now!

17:07.715 --> 17:09.839
- Take the monitor.
- Got it. Pumps are down.

17:10.010 --> 17:11.967
- Let's go. Move away.
- Airway kit.

17:12.137 --> 17:14.544
- You get the feet?
- All set.

17:14.723 --> 17:16.881
- Let's go together.
- All right. We gotta move.

17:17.183 --> 17:21.477
- How far?
- Just keep going. I'll tell you when.

17:22.313 --> 17:24.769
- You all right?
- Got it.

17:24.941 --> 17:26.483
Yeah, yeah. Let's go. Come on!

17:26.651 --> 17:29.521
- Tom, how are you doing there?
- Sats are down to 78.

17:29.696 --> 17:33.029
- All right. I gotta tube him.
- All right. This is far enough.

17:33.199 --> 17:36.235
This will shield us
if the fuel tank blows.

17:37.745 --> 17:40.699
Give me four of Versed,
100 of sux.

17:40.873 --> 17:42.866
- All right.
- Tom...

17:43.042 --> 17:47.039
Tom, we gotta stick a tube
down your throat, help you breathe.

17:48.714 --> 17:51.917
- Do they know where we are?
- Yeah, I called it in. They'll find us.

17:52.092 --> 17:55.627
I'm giving some medicine
to relax you, Tom.

17:57.890 --> 17:59.384
- Got it.
- Do they know anything?

17:59.558 --> 18:02.594
ATC's got a mayday call with location.
EMS and Fire are rolling.

18:02.769 --> 18:04.050
- Injuries?
- They didn't say.

18:04.229 --> 18:06.554
- Well, call them back, damn it!
- What's going on?

18:06.731 --> 18:08.558
- Mark's chopper went down.
- What?

18:08.733 --> 18:10.477
- They crashed?
- An emergency landing.

18:10.652 --> 18:13.439
We don't know that. We don't know
anything. Call Dispatch.

18:13.613 --> 18:16.863
- They don't know anything more.
- I don't care!

18:17.033 --> 18:20.484
I can't have this place fall apart.
Get on with CDO and keep us posted.

18:20.662 --> 18:23.034
- How are we doing?
- We've got 19 patients waiting.

18:23.206 --> 18:27.203
Malucci, grab some charts. Abby, start
some IVs for anyone who needs one.

18:27.376 --> 18:31.374
Get Carter to order x-rays from triage.
All right, let's move, people. Now.

18:31.547 --> 18:34.085
- Where the hell is Kovac?
- We're still trying.

18:42.933 --> 18:45.506
- Very nice.
- Appreciate it.

18:45.686 --> 18:49.102
- You play here a lot?
- Yeah. I work here and the Navy pier.

18:49.273 --> 18:53.104
- What about at night?
- Sometimes for the after-dinner crowd.

18:53.277 --> 18:57.606
Have you ever seen this man?

18:57.989 --> 19:02.283
No. I would remember a guy like that.
You don't seem like a cop.

19:02.953 --> 19:04.945
I'm a doctor.

19:05.121 --> 19:07.612
Try the tour-boat ticket guy.
He's here all the time.

19:07.791 --> 19:11.871
- I did. Thanks.
- Sorry I can't help you.

19:26.183 --> 19:29.303
Good breath sounds.
Keep him on high-flow oxygen.

19:29.478 --> 19:31.352
Fifteen more minutes
and the tank's dry.

19:31.522 --> 19:33.431
- Where's EMS?
- Sound close.

19:33.607 --> 19:36.774
They can't see us. They're gonna
have to call in a police chopper.

19:36.944 --> 19:38.818
We can't wait.
You have any flares?

19:38.988 --> 19:42.238
I have a Verry pistol in the chopper.
But I can barely walk.

19:42.407 --> 19:45.361
- I'll get it.
- Left side, behind the pilot seat.

20:29.370 --> 20:33.319
Luka, it's Abby. Could you call
me when you get this message?

20:33.499 --> 20:37.081
I've been trying to reach you everywhere,
and I'm getting a little worried.

20:37.252 --> 20:40.039
- Abby?
- Call me.

20:40.672 --> 20:43.294
Miss Skye here complains
of abdominal pain.

20:43.467 --> 20:46.171
It's not really my abdomen.

20:47.387 --> 20:51.136
- I can't believe I'm actually embarrassed.
- Well, we see everything here.

20:51.308 --> 20:52.968
Okay.

20:53.143 --> 20:55.598
I got a roll of money stuck up
my...

20:56.438 --> 20:58.893
..."birth canal. "

21:00.400 --> 21:04.065
Look, could you hurry up? I got a cab
waiting with the meter running. Okay?

21:04.237 --> 21:07.902
Dr. Benton, we need you right now.
Six-month baby, respiratory distress.

21:08.074 --> 21:10.743
- Abby?
- Just hold on one second.

21:10.910 --> 21:13.282
Temp's 103.
Coarse crackles bilaterally.

21:13.454 --> 21:17.368
- Pulse ox is only 75.
- All right. Let's take a look.

21:17.541 --> 21:21.409
Sounds like pneumonia. Let's get
a pediatric intubation tray. Move.

21:21.587 --> 21:24.078
We got a line. I'll draw a CBC
and blood culture.

21:24.256 --> 21:27.091
Damn! I don't even do pediatric
intubations. Where's Cleo?

21:27.259 --> 21:30.462
- She took a kid to PICU.
- Get her down here now.

21:31.096 --> 21:33.587
- What size tube?
- We use two and a half in Delivery.

21:33.765 --> 21:37.099
No. I think I need something bigger.
Three, three and a half?

21:37.269 --> 21:39.096
I don't know.

21:39.271 --> 21:41.429
Got the labs.

21:42.065 --> 21:43.559
Move.

21:44.067 --> 21:46.190
He's clamped down.
I can't get the blade in.

21:46.361 --> 21:47.855
- Paralyze him.
- What's the dose?

21:48.029 --> 21:50.947
- You need his weight.
- He's vomiting. Suction.

21:51.116 --> 21:53.986
- Pulse ox is dropping.
- What do we have?

21:54.160 --> 21:56.651
Difficult intubation. I can't dose
without a weight.

21:56.829 --> 21:59.071
That's what the Broselow tape is for.

21:59.248 --> 22:03.116
Okay. We're in the red zone.
2.6 of Etomidate, 18 of sux.

22:03.294 --> 22:07.078
Premedicate with. 17
of atropine, 14 of lido.

22:07.256 --> 22:10.174
Bag him. Keep some cricoid pressure.

22:10.343 --> 22:15.254
- I couldn't see the cords.
- You had the wrong blade and tube.

22:15.973 --> 22:18.464
- Thanks for coming.
- Drugs are on board. He's loose.

22:18.642 --> 22:21.014
- Okay. Here we go.
- Dr. Benton?

22:21.186 --> 22:23.428
- Hold on. Hold on.
- Okay...

22:23.605 --> 22:25.016
I'm in. Bag him.

22:25.190 --> 22:28.191
Dr. Benton, do you want to close
to paramedic traffic?

22:28.360 --> 22:32.903
I've got this. Hang 400 of ceftriaxone.
Settings will be volume at 90 cc's...

22:33.073 --> 22:35.908
No monitor beds, and we're
boarding five ICU patients.

22:36.076 --> 22:37.570
All right. Close to paramedics.

22:37.744 --> 22:41.528
You sure you want to do that?
We've been getting a lot of bad press.

22:41.706 --> 22:43.366
- What would you do?
- I don't know.

22:43.541 --> 22:46.910
- South Side wants to send a patient.
- We're closed to transfers.

22:47.086 --> 22:49.660
It's just a backache.
Their x-ray machine's down.

22:49.839 --> 22:52.674
- Fine! Fine! Fine! Send him!
- So? Do we close?

22:52.842 --> 22:54.751
Don't ask me.
They don't pay me enough.

22:54.927 --> 22:58.094
Paramedics found them on the South
Side. No casualties, thank God!

22:58.264 --> 23:01.051
Well? Well?

23:01.225 --> 23:02.256
Thank you.

23:08.190 --> 23:09.850
- Trent?
- Hey.

23:10.025 --> 23:12.777
They told us to wait
because you were busy.

23:14.280 --> 23:16.355
Is she a friend of yours?

23:16.532 --> 23:19.865
- She's my girlfriend.
- Your girlfriend?

23:20.035 --> 23:22.704
- You said you didn't have one.
- I brought her here.

23:22.913 --> 23:25.582
You gotta be honest with me.
Is she the only one?

23:25.749 --> 23:27.872
Yes. The only one.

23:28.043 --> 23:30.166
I've kissed other girls.
Is that a problem?

23:30.337 --> 23:32.210
- No sex with anyone else?
- No. No.

23:32.756 --> 23:35.329
And you didn't use condoms?

23:35.508 --> 23:37.216
I love her, man.

23:37.719 --> 23:41.882
All right. Okay. Let's run some tests.
We'll see where we are.

23:42.807 --> 23:45.380
- You want to ride up front?
- No. I'm staying with Tom.

23:45.560 --> 23:49.011
- Nearest facility's Oakdale Community.
- No. We're going to County.

23:49.188 --> 23:52.023
Dispatch doesn't want us
to leave our attachment area.

23:52.191 --> 23:55.026
- It's all right. I'll take responsibility.
- Easy now.

23:55.194 --> 23:58.314
- Roy, the doctor says we go to County.
- Can't. County's closed.

23:58.489 --> 24:00.647
- What?
- They just closed. ER saturation.

24:00.825 --> 24:04.276
That's okay. I'm an Attending there.
They'll take us. Let's go.

24:05.412 --> 24:08.912
- Patch me through to the ambulance?
- Dr. Corday, surgical consult in 4.

24:09.083 --> 24:11.752
I'll be there.
Just give me the number.

24:11.919 --> 24:15.786
- Excuse me. I'm looking for Dr. Corday.
- Are you Janet?

24:15.964 --> 24:17.458
- Yeah.
- Elizabeth Corday.

24:17.633 --> 24:20.669
- We expect them very soon.
- How's Tom doing?

24:20.844 --> 24:23.631
Quite well. Apparently,
no one was hurt in the landing.

24:23.805 --> 24:26.925
- What landing?
- Something minor with the helicopter.

24:27.100 --> 24:29.389
So how long
have you two been engaged?

24:29.561 --> 24:32.431
Three years.
So he's not in the helicopter?

24:32.605 --> 24:37.516
No. In an ambulance. My goodness,
three years! That seems like a long time.

24:37.694 --> 24:40.979
Right after he gave me the ring,
he got the flu.

24:41.155 --> 24:45.402
Then the virus went to his heart.
We spend a lot of time in hospitals.

24:45.576 --> 24:47.652
- Have you seen the hernia yet?
- In a minute.

24:47.829 --> 24:50.995
- No, no. Now.
- EKG on a new chest-pain patient.

24:51.165 --> 24:53.621
- Let me see.
- A guy on a backboard for two hours.

24:53.793 --> 24:55.501
- When are you gonna clear his neck?
- When I can.

24:55.669 --> 24:57.164
- Want me to call Weaver in?
- No.

24:57.338 --> 25:00.292
- Are you ever gonna sew me up?
- We're busy. Just wait there.

25:00.466 --> 25:02.458
- What's this?
- A second board. We're backed up.

25:02.635 --> 25:04.627
Four patients just left
without being seen.

25:04.803 --> 25:08.172
I know the solution. We see them,
and have them wait in Chairs.

25:08.348 --> 25:11.183
Come on! Are you crazy? We need
monitoring, IVs, medication.

25:11.351 --> 25:17.351
You doctors order too many tests.
You should be keeping things moving.

25:17.524 --> 25:20.975
- Stroke patient needs a monitored bed.
- We don't have them. Tell him...

25:21.152 --> 25:25.861
- We'll put him in the hall.
- None of my nurses have even had lunch.

25:26.032 --> 25:28.404
Ambulance dropped off
a stab wound to the belly.

25:28.576 --> 25:33.203
All right, all right. That's it.
That's it. Get me the phone.

25:34.582 --> 25:37.832
- Heart rate is 40 after two of atropine.
- Amp of epi.

25:38.002 --> 25:42.747
He needs a pacemaker. We should be
in a hospital right now. Any hospital.

25:42.924 --> 25:45.379
- Rescue 82.
- BP is down to 60 palp.

25:45.551 --> 25:47.342
- Open up the dopamine.
- It's for you.

25:47.511 --> 25:52.304
Hello. Okay, we're almost there.
No. He can't talk right now.

25:52.475 --> 25:55.262
- He's out. I can't feel a pulse.
- I gotta go.

25:55.436 --> 25:58.140
Starting chest compressions.

25:58.605 --> 26:00.598
We could've been
at Oakdale 10 minutes ago.

26:00.774 --> 26:02.648
I'm going on record
you overrode policy.

26:02.818 --> 26:05.735
- There's gonna be an incident report.
- Shut up.

26:06.196 --> 26:08.354
Get back to work.

26:09.074 --> 26:11.909
Hang in there, Tom.
You're gonna make it.

26:12.077 --> 26:15.777
Janet's there. She's waiting for you.

26:20.001 --> 26:21.958
- How long has he been down?
- He never arrested.

26:22.128 --> 26:24.619
- Needs help maintaining a pulse.
- You look exhausted.

26:24.798 --> 26:26.873
- He wouldn't let us relieve him.
- I'll take over.

26:27.050 --> 26:29.089
- We're coming through here!
- What's wrong?

26:29.260 --> 26:30.885
This is Janet Wei, his fiancée.

26:31.054 --> 26:33.295
Tom had a heart attack.
He needs a pacemaker.

26:33.473 --> 26:34.883
You can take his hand.

26:35.057 --> 26:38.889
- It's me. I'm here. Can you hear me?
- Keep talking to him.

26:39.061 --> 26:42.098
- It's Janet. He's squeezing my hand.
- What's his BP?

26:42.273 --> 26:45.060
Seventy systolic on 20 mics
of dopamine.

26:45.234 --> 26:47.725
- What about an intra-aortic balloon?
- Not a bad idea.

26:47.903 --> 26:50.192
- We need the room!
- Everything's backed up!

26:50.364 --> 26:52.771
- We're closed to paramedics.
- Get that patient out!

26:52.950 --> 26:54.741
- Wait! The rapid infuser!
- Oh, my God!

26:54.910 --> 26:56.950
- Clamp the central line!
- Turn it off!

26:57.162 --> 26:59.119
- I'm trying!
- Get Housekeeping in here!

26:59.289 --> 27:03.073
- We need another two units of blood.
- What the hell's going on?

27:03.251 --> 27:07.712
I just got back from transport.
I left Benton in charge.

27:07.923 --> 27:11.208
Mortimer goes to X-ray.
Put the rectal bleed in Exam 3.

27:11.384 --> 27:13.258
A patient says her tongue
is too smooth.

27:13.428 --> 27:14.591
Tell her to get a life.

27:14.763 --> 27:17.467
Smooth tongue could be a sign
of anemia, iron deficiency.

27:17.640 --> 27:19.966
I can't leave without this place
going to hell.

27:20.143 --> 27:22.848
- I've never seen it this busy.
- It's like this every day.

27:23.021 --> 27:26.021
I just heard from the Trib.
Tell me we're not closed to trauma.

27:26.190 --> 27:29.725
- We're not. As of now, we're open.
- We can't see another critical patient.

27:29.902 --> 27:33.947
Get me the nursing supervisor. I want
every stable patient moved out of ICU.

27:34.115 --> 27:36.606
I was under the impression
you could manage the ER.

27:36.784 --> 27:38.942
I was the only Attending.
Kovac never showed.

27:39.120 --> 27:41.611
- He didn't show?!
- He might have switched a shift.

27:41.789 --> 27:43.781
In 20 years, I have never been late.

27:43.958 --> 27:45.915
I guess you work
on a different standard.

27:46.085 --> 27:50.165
Peter, based on your performance, maybe
you're not the guy for the per diem.

27:51.548 --> 27:52.711
- Dr. Carter?
- Yeah?

27:52.883 --> 27:54.922
Lab results on Emma Miller.

27:55.093 --> 27:57.300
- Man!
- That's tough.

27:57.471 --> 27:59.759
Fifteen years old.

28:00.515 --> 28:03.765
Pacer is capturing well.
Setting the rate at 80.

28:03.935 --> 28:06.605
- I got your transducer here.
- How are you doing?

28:06.771 --> 28:10.306
Passing a 40-cc balloon.
I need to check position with fluoro.

28:10.483 --> 28:13.650
Janet, why don't you come talk
to me outside?

28:17.991 --> 28:20.149
This pump should bring
his blood pressure up.

28:20.326 --> 28:23.031
Will he live long enough
to get the heart transplant?

28:23.204 --> 28:24.663
I don't know.

28:28.918 --> 28:30.198
I want to marry him.

28:30.544 --> 28:33.249
I don't know if he's gonna be able
to leave the hospital.

28:33.422 --> 28:37.467
- Can we do it here?
- We could try and arrange it.

28:38.010 --> 28:41.710
I think if we got married
it might help.

28:42.598 --> 28:46.547
- What if they made a mistake?
- I wouldn't tell you if I wasn't certain.

28:46.727 --> 28:50.475
But I don't feel sick.
You should do the test again.

28:50.647 --> 28:54.727
Emma, if you start taking medication
right now, you could stay healthy.

28:54.901 --> 28:57.819
No. I know what happens.
Everybody dies.

28:57.988 --> 29:00.194
That's not true. That's not...

29:00.365 --> 29:03.200
Look at Trent. He's had HIV
his whole life. Look at him.

29:03.368 --> 29:07.745
- I wish we'd never had sex.
- Emma, I didn't know. I swear.

29:07.914 --> 29:10.619
Dr. Carter, tell her. Please.

29:10.792 --> 29:13.793
This is a lot.
This is a lot for you to handle.

29:14.170 --> 29:16.163
And you're both gonna need
some help.

29:16.923 --> 29:22.842
So, before you go, I would like
you both to talk to a counselor.

29:24.263 --> 29:26.552
Hold on, you two. Hold on.

29:26.724 --> 29:29.890
I'll leave you two alone
for a little while.

29:30.436 --> 29:34.184
But before you do anything,
talk it over.

29:34.523 --> 29:36.480
Definitely. Thanks.

29:36.859 --> 29:39.978
Hey. Come on...

29:44.283 --> 29:47.319
- Why is Mr. Chang still here?
- He's waiting for a second CBC.

29:47.494 --> 29:50.246
Okay. Do another HemoCue.
If it's over 11, send him home.

29:50.413 --> 29:54.197
- Torelli's cardiac enzymes.
- Great. All right. She's out of here.

29:54.376 --> 29:58.705
Clears up another monitored bed.
You know, Romano was out of line.

29:58.880 --> 29:59.959
When isn't he?

30:00.131 --> 30:02.966
It's wrong to throw you in
and expect you to swim.

30:03.134 --> 30:06.918
Nobody masters ER management
on their first day.

30:07.096 --> 30:09.255
- What's this?
- Back pain. Collapsed at triage.

30:09.432 --> 30:12.635
Both trauma rooms are full.
Let's take him to Curtain 2. Go!

30:12.810 --> 30:16.226
- I need a central line kit now!
- BP's 60 palp.

30:16.397 --> 30:17.856
Could be a ruptured aneurysm.

30:18.024 --> 30:22.567
CBC, coags, type and cross for eight,
four units of O-neg. Let's prep the neck.

30:22.736 --> 30:26.734
I feel a pulsatile mass. Hey, Malik,
is there any history on this guy?

30:26.907 --> 30:30.572
I need a trauma kit.
This is a triple-lumen CVP.

30:30.744 --> 30:32.951
"History of hypertension
and high cholesterol. "

30:33.122 --> 30:35.992
He needs an NG and a Foley.
I need the SonoSite.

30:36.166 --> 30:39.084
Dr. Benton accepted this patient
from an urgent-care center.

30:39.252 --> 30:42.123
- What? And he's been waiting in Chairs?
- For two hours.

30:42.297 --> 30:44.918
I can't find the subclavian.
Put him in Trendelenburg.

30:45.091 --> 30:48.341
- They said it was just a back sprain.
- The doctor told you that?

30:48.511 --> 30:53.090
- I didn't exactly talk to the doctor.
- Great. And now he's bleeding out.

30:54.976 --> 30:58.808
- Take a deep breath.
- M.A.P. is 78 with a pump.

30:59.147 --> 31:00.261
Is that good or bad?

31:00.440 --> 31:03.275
Took you out of heart failure
and off your breathing tube.

31:03.443 --> 31:05.150
Sats are up to 99.

31:05.319 --> 31:11.192
Get him on five liters, nasal cannula.
Conni, grab a blood-gas kit.

31:11.367 --> 31:13.158
Where's Janet?

31:13.327 --> 31:18.534
She's trying to get a clerk from city
hall to come issue a marriage license.

31:19.166 --> 31:21.040
That's crazy.

31:21.210 --> 31:24.543
- People in love do crazy things.
- I wanted to wait for a transplant...

31:24.713 --> 31:29.505
...so I could chase her down the aisle.
I didn't want her to marry a cripple.

31:29.676 --> 31:32.250
You get a heart, she won't.

31:32.429 --> 31:38.099
If one's available, if the tissues match,
how long can I last on this pump?

31:38.310 --> 31:40.468
Couple weeks.

31:40.645 --> 31:42.056
Pretty lousy odds.

31:42.230 --> 31:46.643
They were worse when you were
having a heart attack in the chopper.

31:49.571 --> 31:53.153
- You see any Zephiran?
- Yeah. Top shelf.

31:53.950 --> 31:57.034
Hey, I heard about your teenagers.
They're so young.

31:57.203 --> 31:59.326
It's pretty rough.

31:59.914 --> 32:02.487
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I think so.

32:02.667 --> 32:04.540
Do you want to take a break?

32:04.710 --> 32:07.332
I'm gonna plug in two new patients.
I'll come find you.

32:07.505 --> 32:10.174
- Talk to Kovac?
- Not yet.

32:17.097 --> 32:19.505
- Dr. Kovac?
- Yeah?

32:19.975 --> 32:24.553
We finished the autopsy. I can review
some of the pertinent findings.

32:25.063 --> 32:28.266
There were multiple contusions
to the occipital cortex...

32:28.442 --> 32:31.857
...with herniation through
the foramen magnum.

32:32.529 --> 32:36.609
And if you'll take a look here,
you'll see numerous fractures...

32:36.783 --> 32:38.610
...consistent with
repetitive blunt trauma.

32:38.785 --> 32:40.363
I know how he died.

32:42.330 --> 32:47.206
Well, I can tell you that he was
a smoker based on the lung findings.

32:47.377 --> 32:50.792
Also, he probably once lived
in central California.

32:50.963 --> 32:55.542
There were foci of pulmonary fibrosis
consistent with coccidioidomycosis.

32:55.718 --> 32:59.881
It's endemic to the San Joaquin Valley.
That's an agricultural area.

33:00.056 --> 33:02.214
Maybe he grew up on a farm.

33:02.391 --> 33:03.672
Well, I don't know.

33:03.851 --> 33:09.438
There's grease under the fingernails
and a biker-club tattoo.

33:09.857 --> 33:14.732
He could be just a drifter.
But we'll probably never know.

33:15.362 --> 33:17.770
Happens all the time.

33:27.916 --> 33:31.249
Not such a smart idea to take your Razor
down a flight of stairs, huh?

33:31.419 --> 33:36.247
- Were you wearing a helmet?
- Yeah. What do you think I am? Stupid?

33:36.424 --> 33:39.425
Well, we'll see after the x-ray.

33:39.594 --> 33:42.132
Right wrist film, something
for the pain. A half a...

33:42.305 --> 33:47.263
It happened so fast. We were fighting.
He ran into the street. A car hit him.

33:47.435 --> 33:49.807
They're doing everything they can.

33:50.938 --> 33:52.812
- Dr. Carter?
- What's the rhythm?

33:52.982 --> 33:55.603
- V-fib.
- Charge to 360.

33:55.776 --> 33:57.436
Trent. Oh, God! Trent.

33:57.611 --> 34:00.398
- What's our down time?
- Twenty minutes. Never had a pulse.

34:00.573 --> 34:02.115
Clear.

34:03.200 --> 34:06.569
- Don't let him die.
- Still V-fib.

34:08.789 --> 34:10.532
- Hey, doc.
- Thanks for coming down.

34:10.706 --> 34:11.987
Sure. What do you need?

34:12.167 --> 34:16.117
Thirty-one-year-old patient, end-stage
heart failure. He may not make it.

34:16.295 --> 34:17.956
- What denomination?
- I don't know.

34:18.130 --> 34:20.338
Can he speak? For last rites,
I need to know.

34:20.509 --> 34:22.547
No. He and his fiancée
want to get married.

34:22.719 --> 34:27.344
- Tonight?
- We can't move him. We gotta do it here.

34:27.514 --> 34:30.849
- Were you able to get a license?
- I tried. But city hall's closing.

34:31.018 --> 34:34.518
- You don't have a marriage license?
- Can you do it anyway?

34:34.688 --> 34:38.734
A marriage isn't legally binding
without a license. How about tomorrow?

34:38.900 --> 34:40.312
Okay.

34:40.485 --> 34:43.357
He may not make it until tomorrow.
Can't you help them?

34:43.531 --> 34:46.815
They want your blessing.
They have very little time.

34:46.993 --> 34:50.775
Well, as long as everyone understands
it won't hold up in court.

34:50.955 --> 34:55.166
- Are you ready to tie the knot?
- Come on. Let's go talk to Tom.

34:55.751 --> 34:59.334
- Dr. Kovac, did you trade your shift?
- No.

34:59.505 --> 35:04.131
Where have you been? They couldn't
reach you. You didn't answer your page.

35:04.301 --> 35:06.009
What's the problem?

35:06.178 --> 35:09.677
That I had to come in today
and cover for you.

35:09.848 --> 35:13.762
- I thought I was on tonight.
- No. You were on today.

35:13.935 --> 35:16.307
Then I'm sorry. There must
have been some mistake.

35:16.480 --> 35:18.970
There was no one with enough
experience to cover you.

35:19.149 --> 35:21.058
We almost lost two patients.

35:21.234 --> 35:26.192
- Luka, this is grounds for dismissal.
- Fine, Kerry. Fire me.

35:26.573 --> 35:31.033
I know that you've been through a lot.
If you need to take time off, tell me.

35:31.202 --> 35:34.037
But you can't miss any more shifts.

35:34.205 --> 35:36.198
- I can work tonight.
- We don't need you.

35:36.374 --> 35:39.410
You should go home. Go on. Go.

35:54.266 --> 35:56.342
- Luka, wait.
- What?

35:56.518 --> 35:59.223
Wait a minute. Don't walk away.

36:00.606 --> 36:03.725
- Where have you been?
- Abby, please.

36:03.900 --> 36:06.356
I want to help. Just talk to me.

36:06.528 --> 36:09.363
There is nothing to say, okay?

36:15.370 --> 36:18.287
To have and to hold,
to love and to cherish...

36:18.456 --> 36:21.243
...as long as you both shall live.

36:21.417 --> 36:24.122
"The union of husband and wife
in heart, body and mind...

36:24.295 --> 36:26.964
...is intended by God
for their mutual joy.

36:27.131 --> 36:29.539
For the health and comfort
given one another...

36:29.717 --> 36:32.884
...in prosperity and adversity.

36:33.054 --> 36:37.383
And when it is God's will,
for the procreation of children. "

36:42.480 --> 36:45.646
You can stay as long as you want,
okay?

36:46.150 --> 36:49.151
- Emma, I am so sorry.
- Get out of here.

36:52.197 --> 36:55.400
- Emma...
- It's your fault.

37:17.847 --> 37:22.308
By the power vested in me,
I pronounce you husband and wife.

37:22.477 --> 37:25.264
Go ahead and kiss your bride, Tom.

37:28.774 --> 37:31.230
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

37:31.402 --> 37:35.649
I'm gonna break all the rules and
allow you to have one sip of champagne.

37:35.823 --> 37:37.103
Thanks.

37:37.283 --> 37:41.576
Well, since this is the honeymoon suite,
you're entitled to a little privacy.

37:41.745 --> 37:45.446
- We're very grateful. Thank you.
- Yeah.

37:45.624 --> 37:47.284
For everything.

37:52.047 --> 37:56.543
Nice folks. Tell them to get a license,
and I'll do it again. No charge.

37:56.718 --> 37:57.833
Thanks.

37:58.011 --> 38:00.680
So, what about our wedding coordinator?

38:00.847 --> 38:04.298
I totally forgot to call and cancel.
She'll be furious.

38:04.476 --> 38:07.227
Blame it on me. I mean,
it was a medical emergency.

38:07.395 --> 38:09.767
- The hell with her!
- Excuse me?

38:09.939 --> 38:15.182
This is all so silly. I don't want a
rose-entwined arbor with trained doves.

38:15.361 --> 38:19.026
I don't want champagne
served out of crystal flutes.

38:19.198 --> 38:20.657
I understand.

38:20.825 --> 38:25.036
- Who cares about a bloody ice sculpture?
- Not me.

38:25.204 --> 38:29.071
I just want to get married
in a simple ceremony.

38:29.250 --> 38:32.998
I don't know. I was looking
forward to those doves.

38:37.591 --> 38:40.925
So I spoke to the O.R.
The aneurysm repair's going well.

38:41.095 --> 38:43.420
- I'm glad to hear it.
- Yeah.

38:43.597 --> 38:47.844
I think it's best for now
if you just see patients. Here.

38:48.018 --> 38:50.094
Well, if that's what you want.

38:50.270 --> 38:51.812
You're an excellent surgeon.

38:51.980 --> 38:57.354
But ER management is not the best use
of your skills. Leave that to us.

39:05.869 --> 39:08.869
Hello, Mrs. Barnwell. I'm Dr. Benton.

39:09.038 --> 39:12.039
So I understand you have a pain
in your hip.

39:12.208 --> 39:15.458
That's right. And I've been lying here
for three hours.

39:15.628 --> 39:18.961
Well, I'm very sorry about that.

39:19.256 --> 39:22.127
Pardon me for asking,
but are you an intern?

39:22.301 --> 39:25.670
No, no. I'm a faculty physician.

39:27.389 --> 39:30.426
Your mother must be very proud.

39:30.601 --> 39:34.385
Yeah, she was. So how long
have you had this pain?

39:34.563 --> 39:37.979
Before we get much further...

39:38.150 --> 39:43.855
...I'd like to say that I would be
more at ease with another doctor.

39:45.741 --> 39:49.820
- Excuse me?
- You look like a fine young man.

39:49.995 --> 39:53.198
But I've always had white doctors.

39:56.418 --> 39:59.917
I've always felt more comfortable
that way.

40:03.299 --> 40:07.249
So you're saying that you only
want to see a white doctor?

40:08.429 --> 40:10.671
If it's all right with you.

40:13.017 --> 40:14.345
That's fine.

40:18.439 --> 40:21.440
You'll just have to wait
another three hours.

40:25.696 --> 40:27.653
- What happened to him?
- I don't know.

40:27.823 --> 40:32.034
- Hey, have you seen Abby?
- I saw her punch out.

40:35.956 --> 40:39.870
- Hey, Carter. You got a minute?
- Actually, I'm just on my way out.

40:46.132 --> 40:48.458
Carter, wait.

40:51.387 --> 40:56.382
John, you had a bad day.
We all have bad days. Look at me.

40:56.559 --> 40:59.477
You have to make tough choices,
do what you think is right...

40:59.645 --> 41:02.101
...and accept the outcome.

41:03.524 --> 41:06.644
- I shouldn't have told him.
- You had to.

41:09.488 --> 41:11.066
I'll see you tomorrow.

41:11.449 --> 41:12.859
Hey...

41:13.284 --> 41:15.276
...I'm off in 20 minutes.

41:15.452 --> 41:17.694
You wanna get some dinner?

41:18.747 --> 41:21.238
- I got an AA meeting at 9:00.
- You'll make it.

41:40.644 --> 41:42.601
Can I join you?

41:43.688 --> 41:46.891
It's a counter, Peter.
You can sit anywhere.

41:48.026 --> 41:50.433
So you survived.

41:51.195 --> 41:54.814
- Weaver said I was incompetent.
- Really?

41:54.991 --> 41:57.564
Well, that's what she implied.

41:57.743 --> 42:01.195
The per diem job is just temporary
until you get back into Surgery.

42:01.372 --> 42:04.539
Yeah. But I needed to show them
that I could run the ER.

42:04.709 --> 42:08.457
Why? It has no bearing
on your surgical career.

42:08.629 --> 42:13.006
Yeah. But it reflects on me, you know?
I should've been able to handle it.

42:13.175 --> 42:15.844
- You can't be perfect at everything.
- Yeah, but, Cleo...

42:16.011 --> 42:18.169
...I can learn a job
if I can do it well.

42:19.556 --> 42:23.885
So do you feel better having said this
to a sympathetic ear?

42:26.229 --> 42:30.013
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. Thanks.

42:31.234 --> 42:35.398
You know, I've had some problems,
and I haven't had anyone to talk to.

42:37.157 --> 42:39.908
Are you ever going to be there for me?

42:42.787 --> 42:45.658
Because you sure as hell haven't been.

43:03.015 --> 43:04.675
Who is it?

43:05.267 --> 43:06.761
It's me.

43:14.610 --> 43:16.519
Can I come in, please?

43:19.114 --> 43:20.573
Sure.

43:33.920 --> 43:36.755
- Abby-
- You don't have to talk.
