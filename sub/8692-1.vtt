01:48.800 --> 01:54.400
The F端hrer's promises of peace and
prosperity have fallen by the wayside...

01:55.700 --> 01:59.700
leaving in their wake a path of destruction.

02:01.500 --> 02:08.500
The outrages committed by Hitler's SS are
a stain on the honor of the German Army.

02:10.600 --> 02:15.800
There is widespread disgust
in the officer corps...

02:16.500 --> 02:19.800
toward the crimes committed
by the Nazis...

02:20.800 --> 02:23.500
the murder of civilians...

02:23.800 --> 02:28.000
the torture and starvation of prisoners...

02:29.300 --> 02:31.600
<i>... the mass execution of Jews.</i>

02:33.100 --> 02:37.000
<i>My duty as an officer is no longer</i>
<i>to save my country,</i>

02:37.800 --> 02:39.800
<i>but to save human lives.</i>

02:41.700 --> 02:44.800
<i>I cannot find one general</i>
<i>in a position to confront Hitler</i>

02:44.800 --> 02:47.100
<i>with the courage to do it.</i>

02:47.300 --> 02:51.200
Colonel Stauffenberg, sir.
The General will be here in four hours.

02:51.300 --> 02:54.400
Thank you.
I'll need to see him when he arrives.

02:58.300 --> 03:02.700
<i>I find myself surrounded by men</i>
<i>unwilling or unable to face the truth.</i>

03:03.400 --> 03:06.900
<i>Hitler is not only</i>
<i>the archenemy of the entire world</i>

03:07.000 --> 03:09.200
<i>but the archenemy of Germany.</i>

03:11.200 --> 03:13.700
<i>A change must be made.</i>

03:17.000 --> 03:20.200
Colonel, my orders are to advance
to Sidi Mansour and hold it.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.300
That's what we'll do.

03:21.400 --> 03:24.300
The British are moving up from the south,
Patton is closing in on the coast.

03:24.400 --> 03:25.700
You know,
we should have left two days ago.

03:25.800 --> 03:27.500
No, Colonel.

03:27.600 --> 03:30.700
We keep fighting until the final victory.

03:30.700 --> 03:33.300
North Africa's lost, and you're going to
need these men a year from now

03:33.400 --> 03:35.000
to defend Berlin.

03:35.500 --> 03:38.800
We can serve Germany or the F端hrer,
not both.

03:41.200 --> 03:44.600
It's just that sort of talk
that had you sent here, Colonel.

03:44.700 --> 03:46.800
What I said was much worse.

03:48.900 --> 03:50.200
General.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.900
I'm just trying
to get these men out of here alive.

04:03.900 --> 04:07.200
- What would you have me do?
- Tell Command we're low on water.

04:07.300 --> 04:10.500
We'd have to reroute to Mezzouna,
join the 21st Panzer.

04:10.600 --> 04:13.000
At least then we'd have a chance.

04:13.900 --> 04:18.300
And the records will show that we didn't
have enough water to reach Sidi Mansour?

04:18.300 --> 04:20.100
I can guarantee it.

04:30.300 --> 04:32.000
See that it's done.

04:32.700 --> 04:33.900
General.

08:14.700 --> 08:15.800
Up!

08:25.800 --> 08:26.900
Down!

08:45.700 --> 08:47.500
- Hitler's leaving.
- Now?

08:47.600 --> 08:48.800
<i>Ja.</i> Fuse.

09:22.400 --> 09:25.100
Colonel Brandt! Colonel Brandt!

09:27.500 --> 09:29.700
My regards to Colonel Stieff.

09:31.100 --> 09:35.500
Cointreau?
Let's hope I don't get thirsty on the flight.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.100
This is Tresckow.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.800
He's landed.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.400
This is General Tresckow.

10:25.500 --> 10:28.400
Connect me with Operations,
Colonel Brandt.

10:30.600 --> 10:32.300
Colonel! Tresckow.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.800
I'm glad you arrived safely.
I hate to trouble you,

10:35.900 --> 10:39.600
but it seems you have the wrong bottles
for Colonel Stieff.

10:40.300 --> 10:42.500
You do still have the package?

10:45.800 --> 10:49.800
Oh, no, no, no. As it happens,
I've been called to Berlin unexpectedly.

10:49.800 --> 10:53.100
I can be at your office first thing
tomorrow morning to pick it up.

10:53.200 --> 10:56.600
Sorry for the inconvenience, Colonel.
Yes, thank you.

10:59.300 --> 11:01.200
Do you think he knows?

11:02.200 --> 11:04.100
Well, there's only one way to find out.

11:17.200 --> 11:19.300
- We've been discovered.
- What makes you think that?

11:19.300 --> 11:22.000
Oster's been arrested.
The Gestapo came for him last night.

11:22.100 --> 11:24.200
The Gestapo could have arrested him
for anything.

11:24.300 --> 11:27.600
- What do you think went wrong?
- We don't know.

11:27.700 --> 11:32.100
Fuse. Temperature. Altitude.
All I know is the damn thing didn't go off.

11:42.900 --> 11:47.500
- General Tresckow to see Colonel Brandt.
- The Colonel's expecting you, sir.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.100
At ease.

12:08.900 --> 12:10.100
You'll forgive me, General.

12:10.100 --> 12:13.600
This little roundup
has had me writing reports all day.

12:14.500 --> 12:17.000
- Roundup?
- Dissenters.

12:18.100 --> 12:22.400
- Another plot against the F端hrer.
- Who are these people?

12:25.800 --> 12:27.600
You'd be surprised.

12:30.700 --> 12:35.900
Now, is this what you've come for?

12:44.000 --> 12:46.100
Perhaps we should open it.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.000
I beg your pardon?

12:49.600 --> 12:53.500
Well, you've come a long way.
You must be thirsty.

12:59.300 --> 13:02.300
You know, I wonder how the F端hrer,
who does not partake,

13:02.400 --> 13:05.700
would feel about a soldier
who did so on duty.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.000
Colonel Brandt.

13:16.800 --> 13:19.400
I took you for another sort, General.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.600
And I you.

13:31.900 --> 13:34.700
We're still in business.

13:34.800 --> 13:36.300
Find a replacement for Oster.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.900
There's no one we can trust, not in Berlin.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.500
Well, then stop looking in Berlin.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.900
Countess von Stauffenberg?

14:11.800 --> 14:14.500
Perhaps before you go in, we could have
a word together in my office.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.600
I will see my husband now.

14:24.700 --> 14:27.700
The right hand has been amputated
above the wrist.

14:27.800 --> 14:31.400
He's missing the fourth and fifth fingers
on the left hand.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.800
We couldn't save the left eye.

15:32.600 --> 15:33.800
Colonel.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.100
When you're ready, sir.

16:19.900 --> 16:22.600
<i>I'm a soldier. I serve my country.</i>

16:24.500 --> 16:26.800
<i>But this is not my country.</i>

16:26.800 --> 16:31.700
<i>I was lying out there bleeding to death,</i>
<i>thinking, "If I die now,</i>

16:31.800 --> 16:34.700
<i>"I leave nothing to my children</i>
<i>but shame. "</i>

16:37.500 --> 16:40.900
I know now there's only one way
to serve Germany.

16:42.500 --> 16:46.300
In doing so, I'll be a traitor. I accept that.

16:47.900 --> 16:50.900
Just tell me,
can these men see it through?

16:53.900 --> 16:58.600
We need to reorganize.
Reconsider our strategy, recruit new men.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
That's why we want you.

17:04.700 --> 17:07.800
You understand what will happen
to my wife and children

17:07.900 --> 17:10.400
if these men can't see it through?

17:13.900 --> 17:16.500
Come and hear what they have to say.

17:29.400 --> 17:31.500
You know where to find us.

17:58.900 --> 18:01.900
Enough! Enough. I'm not going to listen
to another word of this.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.200
You had your chance, you failed.

18:04.300 --> 18:07.900
Your so-called "central solution"
didn't work.

18:07.900 --> 18:10.900
Our only option now
is to confront Hitler openly.

18:10.900 --> 18:12.100
This is a military operation...

18:12.100 --> 18:14.700
It's not a military operation,
it's a political organization,

18:14.700 --> 18:17.100
and one that's given its military arm
too much control.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.300
In any military exercise,

18:18.400 --> 18:20.200
you have to expect
a certain measure of deviation.

18:20.300 --> 18:24.000
A measure? A measure?
What about total, complete, utter failure?

18:24.100 --> 18:26.300
Gentlemen, I think it's time
we face the fact

18:26.400 --> 18:29.900
that the Allies are coming, sooner or later.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.500
I say we sit back
and let them wipe out the Nazis.

18:32.600 --> 18:35.800
And ask every living soul in Europe
to pay the price? Use your head.

18:35.900 --> 18:37.900
- Carl, please.
- I'm sorry, Ludwig.

18:37.900 --> 18:39.500
I've held my tongue too long.

18:39.600 --> 18:43.200
We must confront Hitler now.
Force him out!

18:43.300 --> 18:44.800
And then what?

18:46.500 --> 18:48.100
I beg your pardon?

18:48.900 --> 18:51.000
When Hitler is gone, then what?

18:54.100 --> 18:55.700
I'm sorry, who is this man?

18:55.800 --> 18:58.800
Colonel Stauffenberg
is Oster's replacement.

18:58.800 --> 19:02.300
He's been transferred to my office
at the War Ministry.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.700
- How's your uncle?
- He's well, sir. He sends his regards.

19:06.800 --> 19:10.200
- He speaks very highly of you.
- And of you, General.

19:10.300 --> 19:12.700
Of course, one of the things
that made Oster such a great organizer

19:12.700 --> 19:15.600
was that he kept his opinions to himself.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.800
I'm simply asking what you intend to do
when Hitler is gone.

19:20.800 --> 19:23.900
You don't really believe you could just
walk into the Reich Chancellery

19:24.000 --> 19:26.200
and command the army to end the war?

19:26.300 --> 19:27.800
Yes. We do.

19:34.200 --> 19:37.800
You are in the presence of men
who would have been Hitler's inner circle.

19:37.800 --> 19:40.300
Instead, we refused, Colonel.

19:40.400 --> 19:43.900
The people know we put our principles
above personal gain.

19:43.900 --> 19:47.400
We have the respect of the people.
And the army.

19:50.300 --> 19:54.600
Then you don't need me. Gentlemen.

19:58.200 --> 20:01.000
<i>Those men are confusing</i>
<i>respect with popularity.</i>

20:01.500 --> 20:06.200
The army swore an oath,
an oath that won't just die with Hitler.

20:06.300 --> 20:07.400
What are you going to do?

20:07.500 --> 20:09.900
How are you going to deal with Goebbels?
Himmler? The SS?

20:10.000 --> 20:12.900
- They will wipe you out!
- It doesn't matter!

20:15.100 --> 20:18.900
It only matters that we act, now,
before we lose the war.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.200
Otherwise, this will always be
Hitler's Germany.

20:26.100 --> 20:30.000
And we have to show the world
that not all of us were like him.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.700
That is not enough for me.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.600
There has to be a chance of success.

20:38.100 --> 20:39.700
Then find a way.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.500
- <i>Poppy!</i>
- <i>Poppy!</i>

20:43.000 --> 20:45.500
- Poppy's home! Poppy's home!
- Poppy's here! Poppy's here!

20:45.500 --> 20:46.700
Mommy, he's here!

20:46.800 --> 20:49.500
- Mom, come down!
- Poppy's here!

20:59.900 --> 21:03.200
I thought we agreed
I'd come see you in Bamberg.

21:03.300 --> 21:06.400
- The children couldn't wait.
- The children?

21:48.400 --> 21:49.800
Super!

23:36.500 --> 23:37.800
<i>Valkyrie.</i>

23:38.500 --> 23:40.300
We've already considered Valkyrie.
It isn't suitable.

23:40.400 --> 23:42.500
Not as it's currently written,
but the Colonel has an idea

23:42.600 --> 23:45.200
- I think we should consider.
- Excuse me. What is Valkyrie?

23:45.200 --> 23:46.800
Operation Valkyrie.

23:46.900 --> 23:50.200
The Reserve Army has thousands of men
all over Berlin.

23:50.300 --> 23:52.800
Valkyrie is Hitler's contingency plan

23:52.900 --> 23:55.400
to mobilize those men
during a national emergency.

23:55.500 --> 23:58.000
The sole purpose of the order
is to protect Hitler's government

23:58.000 --> 24:01.200
- if he's cut off or killed.
- And what use is this to us?

24:01.300 --> 24:04.900
Valkyrie is designed
to contain civil unrest.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.700
But what if the SS were staging a coup?

24:11.600 --> 24:14.800
State Security is trying
to overthrow Hitler.

24:14.900 --> 24:17.100
- How would High Command respond?
- We would have no choice.

24:17.100 --> 24:18.900
We would declare
a military state of emergency.

24:18.900 --> 24:20.600
Exactly, and initiate Valkyrie.

24:20.700 --> 24:23.600
Hitler's own Reserve Army,
using Hitler's own plan,

24:23.700 --> 24:28.300
will have no choice but to seize power
in Berlin to prevent the SS takeover.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.100
They'll think they're fighting
for Hitler's government, not against it.

24:33.200 --> 24:36.500
While we quietly put
a new government in place.

24:37.900 --> 24:39.800
But only if he's dead.

24:41.100 --> 24:42.700
That's what you're saying, isn't it?

24:42.800 --> 24:46.300
How else are you going to convince people
the SS are trying to seize power?

24:46.400 --> 24:48.300
We have to kill Hitler.

24:48.300 --> 24:51.700
I'm disappointed in you, Colonel.
I thought a man of your background

24:51.700 --> 24:54.700
would suggest
a more honorable approach.

24:54.800 --> 24:58.400
Your plan has a few
minor obstacles, Colonel.

24:58.500 --> 25:01.900
Firstly, Valkyrie would have
to be rewritten to exclude the SS.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.700
Then I'll need your help to get a copy.

25:05.600 --> 25:08.000
Rewriting an order is one thing.

25:09.500 --> 25:11.700
Distributing it is another.

25:11.800 --> 25:13.100
In this case,

25:13.200 --> 25:16.800
we'd be willfully circulating
written evidence of high treason.

25:16.800 --> 25:19.500
Evidence requiring Hitler's signature.

25:25.200 --> 25:28.100
Well, we can all draw straws for that job.

25:28.800 --> 25:31.300
- And what about Fromm?
- Fromm? Who is Fromm?

25:31.300 --> 25:33.000
He's the commander of the Reserve Army.

25:33.000 --> 25:37.700
I can put the reserve troops on alert,
but only Fromm can initiate Valkyrie.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.800
Can you get to him?

25:45.700 --> 25:49.200
We're running out of time.
Can you get to Fromm?

25:49.300 --> 25:50.500
He's a careerist pig.

25:50.600 --> 25:53.200
But one who's gone as far as he can go
in Hitler's army.

25:53.200 --> 25:55.300
It's no secret he's not happy about it.

25:55.300 --> 25:58.300
Offer him a key position
in the new regime.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.900
Make him see the light.

26:09.200 --> 26:11.400
Your office is through there.

26:15.100 --> 26:17.400
I have Colonel Stauffenberg
for General Fromm.

26:17.500 --> 26:20.400
Colonel Stauffenberg, sir.
Welcome back to the War Ministry.

26:20.400 --> 26:23.700
- It's an honor, sir.
- You're an old woman, Fromm!

26:23.700 --> 26:25.000
I'd send you to the front

26:25.100 --> 26:29.100
if I didn't think you'd surrender
just to be Montgomery's whore!

26:34.600 --> 26:35.700
The General will see you now.

26:51.300 --> 26:53.100
What is it you want?

26:53.700 --> 26:57.200
I wanted to introduce our new man,
Colonel Stauffenberg.

26:59.800 --> 27:01.300
From Africa.

27:02.000 --> 27:05.700
I... I'd offer you my hand,
but I might not get it back.

27:07.300 --> 27:11.300
I'd say the General has lost
more important things this morning.

27:18.100 --> 27:20.800
It's about time they put somebody
with balls into this office.

27:20.900 --> 27:24.600
Please, sit down, Colonel.
And you, Olbricht, if you must.

27:37.600 --> 27:39.900
They tell me you're critical
of the war, Colonel,

27:40.000 --> 27:42.500
not that you don't seem
to have good reason.

27:42.600 --> 27:44.600
I am critical of indecision, General.

27:44.600 --> 27:46.600
- In the field?
- In Berlin.

27:49.400 --> 27:52.100
So that's why you're here, I take it, to...

27:52.200 --> 27:55.200
- To make decisions.
- I've already made my decision.

27:55.300 --> 27:57.800
I'm here to help others make theirs.

28:02.400 --> 28:05.100
They say when there's no clear option,

28:06.300 --> 28:11.000
- the best thing is to do nothing.
- We're at war. We must act.

28:11.100 --> 28:13.000
Sometimes rashly.

28:15.200 --> 28:18.500
And what rash action
did you have in mind, Colonel?

28:19.900 --> 28:24.900
That would be a decision
for the supreme military commander, sir.

28:25.700 --> 28:27.500
A supreme commander.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.800
Second only to the Chancellor.

28:38.400 --> 28:40.200
If I were that man,

28:42.600 --> 28:45.400
this war would be going quite differently.

28:45.900 --> 28:48.500
Well, we were thinking the same thing.

28:57.200 --> 29:00.200
I don't need to remind you

29:01.800 --> 29:04.600
that we've all sworn an oath

29:07.100 --> 29:08.700
to the F端hrer.

29:16.100 --> 29:19.500
Having said that, I'm going to forget
this conversation ever took place,

29:19.600 --> 29:21.000
in the strict understanding

29:21.100 --> 29:23.900
that such talk never occurs again
under this roof.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.600
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

29:25.700 --> 29:30.200
Now, you can tell your friends, Colonel,
that I always come down on the right side.

29:30.300 --> 29:35.100
And as long as the F端hrer is alive,
you know what side that is.

29:43.400 --> 29:44.700
<i>Heil</i> Hitler.

29:44.700 --> 29:46.800
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.

30:18.400 --> 30:21.700
Of course! Yes! Very good guess!

30:45.400 --> 30:48.400
You realize how close I am to Hitler.

30:48.500 --> 30:51.200
With one word I can make you disappear.

30:52.300 --> 30:54.000
My associates don't know
we've been talking,

30:54.000 --> 30:56.100
- if that's what you're afraid of.
- When the SS catch you,

30:56.200 --> 30:59.500
they will pull you apart like warm bread.

30:59.600 --> 31:02.600
It will be a crime
just to have known you then.

31:02.600 --> 31:06.100
I warn you, don't try to contact me again.

31:06.200 --> 31:07.700
You won't report me.

31:07.800 --> 31:10.300
Maybe if you had
when I first approached you,

31:10.400 --> 31:13.800
you might have been keeping your oath.

31:13.800 --> 31:15.300
Now you're just as guilty as the rest of us.

31:15.400 --> 31:17.700
And you think that makes me
a sympathizer, hey?

31:17.800 --> 31:20.400
Give a man a choice of betraying
his fellow officer or his F端hrer

31:20.500 --> 31:23.000
and you think his actions
will show you his heart.

31:23.100 --> 31:26.000
- It is not that simple.
- Yes. Yes, it is.

31:26.100 --> 31:29.800
For the last time,
don't push me to make a decision.

31:29.900 --> 31:32.600
I don't have a choice. It's clear now.

31:34.500 --> 31:37.300
Without you, there is no hope of success.

31:37.900 --> 31:40.400
You're nothing but rats
jumping from a sinking ship!

31:40.500 --> 31:42.900
What makes you think
you'll be any different?

31:43.000 --> 31:45.500
What makes you think you're stronger
than the people, the Reich?

31:45.600 --> 31:48.500
- The very momentum of history!
- This is going to happen.

31:48.600 --> 31:52.000
Action is inevitable,
as are the consequences.

31:52.100 --> 31:53.600
When they come for me,
I'll do everything I can

31:53.700 --> 31:55.300
to hide what you knew
and when you knew it,

31:55.400 --> 31:57.100
but don't delude yourself.

31:57.200 --> 31:59.200
You were involved in a crime
against your country

31:59.300 --> 32:01.200
long before you met me.

32:03.400 --> 32:06.300
There may still be time
to redeem yourself.

32:09.800 --> 32:11.900
Only God can judge us now.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.900
Hitler had Operation Valkyrie designed

32:20.900 --> 32:23.700
to completely secure his government
in six hours.

32:23.800 --> 32:28.400
I'm rewriting the order so we can seize
control of the government in three.

32:28.500 --> 32:30.200
As written,
the order spreads reserve troops

32:30.200 --> 32:32.700
across all of Germany's
19 military districts,

32:32.700 --> 32:36.800
including occupied cities
like Paris, Vienna and Prague.

32:37.200 --> 32:38.600
<i>This is a waste of resources.</i>

32:38.700 --> 32:42.500
<i>Since all of these districts follow</i>
<i>orders from Berlin without question,</i>

32:42.600 --> 32:45.000
<i>you take Berlin, you take Germany.</i>

32:46.400 --> 32:48.100
I'm rewriting Valkyrie

32:48.100 --> 32:49.800
to direct the majority
of our strongest units

32:49.900 --> 32:52.000
to focus entirely on Berlin.

32:53.300 --> 32:56.800
We'll surround the government quarter,
occupy all SS and police barracks.

32:56.900 --> 33:01.300
Once we have control of the government,
we'll shut down all concentration camps.

33:01.400 --> 33:04.100
Any officers who resist
will be arrested or shot.

33:04.200 --> 33:06.700
I've been transferred to the front.

33:10.100 --> 33:11.500
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

33:11.600 --> 33:14.400
You know these orders
better than anyone.

33:14.500 --> 33:18.100
That's why I'm putting you in charge
of the military wing of the operation.

33:18.200 --> 33:20.500
- Beck agrees.
- Why not Olbricht?

33:20.500 --> 33:23.600
No. It's your plan. It's you.

33:24.700 --> 33:26.800
One more thing.
You need to be absolutely certain

33:26.900 --> 33:28.900
no conflicting orders get out
after the flash.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.500
It is not enough to kill Hitler.

33:31.600 --> 33:33.400
We need to isolate his chain of command

33:33.400 --> 33:36.000
and cut them off
from the outside world immediately.

33:36.100 --> 33:40.800
Yes, I've already considered that.
I think I have just the man who can help.

33:40.900 --> 33:44.700
- Who is he?
- Perhaps it's better I don't say.

33:49.400 --> 33:52.200
You know, God promised Abraham
he would not destroy Sodom

33:52.200 --> 33:55.600
if he could find just 10 righteous men.

33:55.700 --> 33:59.400
I have a feeling that, for Germany,
it may come down to one.

34:05.900 --> 34:07.400
Let's begin.

34:08.400 --> 34:11.199
"The F端hrer, Adolf Hitler,

34:14.100 --> 34:15.500
"is dead."

34:22.600 --> 34:24.400
<i>Heil</i> Hitler, General.

34:27.300 --> 34:30.800
Would you excuse us, please? Thank you.

34:37.900 --> 34:41.199
You play the part
of bureaucrat beautifully.

34:41.199 --> 34:42.800
It's the only time I get to relax.

34:42.900 --> 34:46.500
You've been promoted
Chief of Staff for the Reserve Army.

34:47.500 --> 34:49.699
- Excuse me?
- Congratulations.

34:52.199 --> 34:54.900
- I am busy with other things.
- Unfortunately,

34:55.000 --> 34:58.500
your nocturnal activities
don't count as service to the Reich.

34:58.600 --> 35:01.900
- I'll refuse the promotion.
- You'll do no such thing.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.600
Tresckow may have left you
in charge of the operation,

35:04.700 --> 35:06.600
but in this world I still outrank you.

35:06.600 --> 35:09.100
You will accept the promotion.

35:09.100 --> 35:14.200
You'll have real access to Hitler,
his advisers, his schedule. We need this.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
I've looked through your changes
to Valkyrie.

35:20.600 --> 35:23.800
I approve.
I'll need you to get Hitler to sign it.

35:28.500 --> 35:31.600
Now. There's a man here to interview
as your adjutant.

35:31.700 --> 35:33.900
He comes highly recommended.

35:40.700 --> 35:42.200
Close the door.

35:46.600 --> 35:47.900
Be seated.

35:51.700 --> 35:54.700
Do you know
how this war will end, Lieutenant?

35:55.500 --> 35:57.700
The portrait will be unhung,

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
and the man will be hung.

36:08.600 --> 36:11.700
I'm engaged in high treason
with all means available to me.

36:11.800 --> 36:13.500
Can I count you in?

36:21.300 --> 36:24.000
For anything, sir. Anything at all.

37:24.900 --> 37:26.600
Come. Come, come.

37:34.100 --> 37:36.100
Colonel Brandt, Operations.

37:36.200 --> 37:41.200
Colonel Stauffenberg, I'd like to review
your presentation to the F端hrer.

37:41.300 --> 37:42.300
Strictly routine.

37:42.400 --> 37:44.900
Sir, the contents of the Colonel's bag
are for the F端hrer's eyes only.

37:44.900 --> 37:47.000
I am the F端hrer's eyes, Lieutenant.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.100
The Colonel is a member of my staff
at the War Ministry.

37:49.200 --> 37:51.200
He doesn't answer to you.

37:53.500 --> 37:56.700
- They're waiting.
- This way.

38:33.200 --> 38:36.100
My F端hrer.
May I present Colonel Stauffenberg,

38:36.100 --> 38:39.100
our new chief of staff
for the Reserve Army.

38:39.900 --> 38:41.500
<i>Heil,</i> my F端hrer.

38:46.700 --> 38:49.400
May I say what an honor it is
to meet an officer

38:49.400 --> 38:54.100
who has sacrificed so much for Germany.

39:00.500 --> 39:03.100
If only more of my men were like you.

39:04.900 --> 39:07.200
Let this man stand
as an example to all of you.

39:07.200 --> 39:10.000
He is the ideal German officer.

39:12.400 --> 39:16.300
My F端hrer. Colonel Stauffenberg
was asked to come here today

39:16.400 --> 39:20.400
to brief us on mobilizing troops
of the Reserve Army to...

39:20.500 --> 39:22.400
To repel the invasion.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.300
Invasion?

39:26.800 --> 39:29.300
At Normandy, my F端hrer.

39:31.400 --> 39:32.600
Oh, yes.

39:34.400 --> 39:35.700
Normandy.

39:37.100 --> 39:39.000
That will not be necessary.

39:40.300 --> 39:45.100
<i>Reichsmarschall</i> G旦ring assures me that
everything is completely under control.

39:47.900 --> 39:49.600
Thank you, Colonel.

39:53.500 --> 39:55.800
My F端hrer, if I may.

39:55.900 --> 39:59.800
I have an amended copy
of Operation Valkyrie for your approval.

40:51.200 --> 40:53.400
You know your Wagner, Colonel?

40:59.800 --> 41:04.300
The Valkyrie. Handmaidens of the Gods,

41:04.400 --> 41:09.400
choosing who will live and who will die,
sparing the most heroic

41:11.200 --> 41:13.300
from an agonizing death.

41:18.900 --> 41:21.700
One cannot understand National Socialism

41:23.600 --> 41:26.000
if one does not understand Wagner.

41:42.600 --> 41:46.000
I'm sure whatever changes you've made
are for the best.

41:51.100 --> 41:54.300
You're dismissed. Send your man home.
And, Fromm?

41:55.200 --> 41:58.000
Have some fresh tea brought in, will you?

42:09.600 --> 42:13.300
I don't know what you're brewing up,
and I don't want to know.

42:13.300 --> 42:15.200
But when the music stops,

42:15.200 --> 42:18.700
I'd be obliged if Keitel found himself
without a chair.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.300
Any problem on Earth can be solved

42:34.300 --> 42:37.700
with the careful application
of high explosives.

42:37.700 --> 42:41.100
The trick is not to be around
when they go off.

42:41.200 --> 42:46.700
Two 975-gram packs of Plastit W.
Enough explosive to cripple a panzer.

42:46.700 --> 42:50.400
Your detonators, your fuses.
British time pencils.

42:51.200 --> 42:54.600
This acid capsule is your trigger.
When you're ready to arm,

42:54.600 --> 42:59.500
attach the detonator to the bottom
of the time pencil, like so,

42:59.600 --> 43:03.400
insert the entire device
into either end of the Plastit W,

43:03.500 --> 43:07.600
crush the acid capsule, and you're live.

43:09.300 --> 43:13.900
When the acid eats through the wire
holding back the firing pin,

43:13.900 --> 43:16.600
well, you'll want to be very far away.

43:19.800 --> 43:21.100
For you.

43:21.800 --> 43:24.700
- How much time will we have?
- Theoretically there's a 30-minute delay,

43:24.800 --> 43:27.200
but with the kind of heat
you can expect at the Wolf's Lair,

43:27.300 --> 43:29.400
I'd give you 10, 15 minutes, tops.

43:29.500 --> 43:31.400
That's hardly precise.

43:31.500 --> 43:35.000
This is state-of-the-art.
You can have small or precise, not both.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.200
Might this just be a little too small?

43:37.300 --> 43:40.700
No. Hitler's bunker will magnify the blast.

43:40.700 --> 43:44.700
It is constructed of reinforced concrete.
Steel door, no windows.

43:44.800 --> 43:48.100
The air pressure generated by just one
of these explosives in a space like that

43:48.200 --> 43:50.000
will kill everyone instantly.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.300
The second charge
will be entirely redundant.

43:52.400 --> 43:56.200
Lf, by some miracle,
Hitler does survive, what then?

43:56.300 --> 43:58.600
We still initiate Valkyrie.

43:58.700 --> 44:01.100
At that point,
there will be no turning back.

44:01.200 --> 44:03.300
But we'll have an advantage.

44:04.700 --> 44:07.100
We have an inside man at the Wolf's Lair.

44:07.100 --> 44:10.000
After the flash, he'll cut off communication
with the outside world.

44:10.100 --> 44:12.400
While Hitler's inner circle
is struggling to regroup,

44:12.500 --> 44:16.200
we'll have the momentum we need
to seize control in Berlin.

44:17.200 --> 44:19.500
Himmler is expected to be
at the meeting as well.

44:19.600 --> 44:22.400
Don't proceed
unless you can get them both.

44:22.500 --> 44:24.000
What?

44:24.100 --> 44:28.600
Don't proceed unless you're confident
you can get both Himmler and Hitler.

44:34.800 --> 44:37.000
This is Goerdeler, isn't it?

44:41.000 --> 44:43.800
I'll hold off, if the decision is unanimous,

44:43.800 --> 44:47.800
but I want another man on the committee.
Not a politician.

44:47.900 --> 44:50.200
- Who?
- Him.

44:51.300 --> 44:53.100
- Him?
- Him.

44:54.100 --> 44:55.200
Fine.

44:56.500 --> 45:02.200
But remember, this is a military operation.
Nothing ever goes according to plan.

45:32.900 --> 45:35.300
I'll take the children to Bamberg.

45:42.400 --> 45:43.800
If I fail,

45:47.400 --> 45:49.200
they'll come for you.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.400
All of you.

45:56.200 --> 45:57.500
I know.

46:24.500 --> 46:26.200
Gentlemen. Good morning.

46:26.300 --> 46:30.200
Hitler has scheduled a military briefing
for today at 1:00.

46:30.300 --> 46:32.800
Stauffenberg will start
once everyone is present.

46:33.200 --> 46:35.600
- They're here.
- <i>Before arming the explosives,</i>

46:35.700 --> 46:38.600
<i>Stauffenberg will call</i>
<i>for authorization to proceed.</i>

46:38.700 --> 46:43.500
<i>After the flash, his inside man</i>
<i>will sever all communications.</i>

46:43.600 --> 46:46.100
<i>Assuming Fromm refuses to join us,</i>

46:46.200 --> 46:48.400
<i>Olbricht would take command</i>
<i>of the Reserve Army</i>

46:48.500 --> 46:50.400
- <i>and initiate Valkyrie.</i>
- Initiate Valkyrie.

46:50.500 --> 46:54.800
<i>Then he'll notify all district commanders</i>
<i>that the SS is attempting to seize power.</i>

46:54.900 --> 46:59.300
<i>The Reserve Army will arrest all SS,</i>
<i>Gestapo and Nazi officials.</i>

46:59.400 --> 47:01.600
<i>By then, Stauffenberg</i>
<i>will have returned to Berlin</i>

47:01.600 --> 47:04.100
<i>and taken command of the Reserve Army.</i>

47:04.200 --> 47:07.800
<i>Witzleben and I will assume the roles</i>
<i>of commander of the armed forces</i>

47:07.900 --> 47:09.400
<i>and head of state.</i>

47:09.500 --> 47:10.700
<i>With Berlin secured,</i>

47:10.700 --> 47:13.800
<i>Dr. Goerdeler will address the nation</i>
<i>as our new chancellor.</i>

47:14.400 --> 47:16.700
Then, God willing,

47:16.800 --> 47:21.700
we can negotiate a truce with the Allies
and save Europe from total destruction.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.900
This will identify you
as a member of the operation.

47:27.000 --> 47:30.300
Nobody gets in or out of the perimeter
without one.

47:32.000 --> 47:35.900
Gentlemen, this is the most important day
of your lives.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.100
Long live sacred Germany.

48:18.400 --> 48:20.200
- Captain.
- What is it?

48:20.200 --> 48:21.900
An order from General Olbricht's office.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.500
It's calling the Reserve Army
for some sort of standby action

48:24.600 --> 48:28.200
in all the military districts,
including Berlin.

48:28.300 --> 48:31.100
Looks like a drill of some kind.
Send it through, Sergeant.

48:51.300 --> 48:52.400
Sir?

48:58.300 --> 49:02.900
- "Standby action"? What the hell for?
- The order doesn't say.

49:04.800 --> 49:08.000
Assemble the men.
This better not be a drill.

50:50.000 --> 50:53.300
The men are assembled
and awaiting further orders.

50:53.300 --> 50:56.300
What do you suppose
this is really all about?

53:18.300 --> 53:19.600
Your man?

53:31.000 --> 53:32.300
He is now.

54:51.800 --> 54:53.100
Colonel.

55:05.300 --> 55:06.700
Attention!

55:18.600 --> 55:22.200
Gentlemen. For our first order of business,

55:22.300 --> 55:24.900
General Fromm will present his plans

55:24.900 --> 55:28.700
for the reallocation of troops from
the Reserve Army on the eastern front.

55:28.800 --> 55:31.800
Now, as you know, last night
the Russians launched a new offensive

55:31.900 --> 55:35.900
against Army Group North Ukraine
in the South Poland section.

55:36.000 --> 55:39.100
General Harpe was brought in
to replace Model

55:39.200 --> 55:41.900
and bring a swift end to this confrontation.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.700
- Himmler is not here.
- Hence the transfer of three divisions

55:44.800 --> 55:49.400
to fortify General Harpe's troops.

55:50.100 --> 55:54.600
Now, these divisions will stick
to a mobile defense plan

55:54.700 --> 55:57.000
rather than holding any one particular...

56:02.100 --> 56:05.300
Yes, sir. I'll put that right through.
Connecting now.

56:05.400 --> 56:07.400
- <i>Operator.</i>
- Direct me to the War Ministry.

56:07.400 --> 56:09.100
- General Olbricht's office.
- <i>One moment, please.</i>

56:09.200 --> 56:11.200
Yes, sir. Connecting now.

56:15.100 --> 56:17.400
- General Olbricht's office.
- Himmler's not in the briefing.

56:17.500 --> 56:19.100
I'm ready to arm. Permission to proceed.

56:19.400 --> 56:21.100
Hold the line.

56:21.200 --> 56:25.100
Stauffenberg says Himmler's not
at the briefing. He wants to proceed.

56:25.200 --> 56:26.500
Call Beck.

56:29.300 --> 56:32.000
- Beck.
- <i>Himmler is not at the briefing.</i>

56:33.400 --> 56:35.700
Himmler's not at the briefing.

56:45.700 --> 56:48.000
...already diminished reserves.

56:50.900 --> 56:52.000
<i>No.</i>

56:56.200 --> 56:57.300
They say no.

57:00.800 --> 57:02.400
What do you say?

57:07.200 --> 57:08.700
I say do it.

57:09.500 --> 57:10.900
Attention!

57:46.000 --> 57:49.500
Whatever it was, Colonel,
I hope it was important.

57:51.900 --> 57:54.400
Colonel? Your bag.

58:18.900 --> 58:22.500
This has been a drill! You're dismissed!

58:26.500 --> 58:29.900
How dare you put the Reserve Army
on standby without my knowledge?

58:30.000 --> 58:31.600
Damn near cost me my commission.

58:31.700 --> 58:34.300
And what in God's name made you think
you even had the authority?

58:34.400 --> 58:38.700
- It was only a drill, an exercise.
- Don't lie, Olbricht! Not to me.

58:39.400 --> 58:40.800
We both know it wasn't a drill.

58:40.900 --> 58:43.400
- General, if I may...
- No, you may not, Colonel.

58:43.500 --> 58:45.100
You may not do anything.

58:45.200 --> 58:47.300
Because not only have you proved to me
you can't deliver,

58:47.300 --> 58:50.000
you've painted a target on my back.

58:50.100 --> 58:54.100
If I so much as sense you trying
to move the Reserve Army again,

58:54.100 --> 58:57.000
I will personally have you both arrested.

58:59.200 --> 59:02.100
Do I make myself abundantly clear?

59:02.200 --> 59:04.000
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

59:08.400 --> 59:10.400
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.
- <i>Heil</i> Hitler.

59:12.600 --> 59:14.800
I'll hear you say it, Colonel.

59:24.000 --> 59:25.400
<i>Heil</i> Hitler!

59:36.200 --> 59:39.500
The point of replacing Hitler
is to negotiate a truce with the Allies.

59:39.600 --> 59:42.000
The Allies, I suspect,
would be more amenable to a truce

59:42.100 --> 59:45.100
if we offer it to them
before they get to fucking Berlin!

59:45.200 --> 59:48.600
There's no point in killing Hitler
unless you kill Himmler, too.

59:48.700 --> 59:51.200
Why remove a madman
just to have a lunatic take his place?

59:51.300 --> 59:54.000
Today's failure had nothing to do
with Himmler, and you know it.

59:54.100 --> 59:57.800
This is a military operation
in the hands of a politician, nothing more.

59:57.800 --> 01:00:00.100
- What are you suggesting?
- I'm not suggesting anything.

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:02.200
I'm stating the facts as I see them.

01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:05.300
You don't have the courage to kill Hitler,
so you are making the task impossible.

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:08.500
Nothing seemed to stop you and your
henchman from trying it on your own.

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:10.800
My only regret is that I waited for you
to find your backbone.

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.900
I don't think I'm alone
when I say your judgment is in question.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.900
- I'd like to call a vote.
- Carl.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.300
I propose
that we relieve Colonel Stauffenberg.

01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:23.600
Carl, can I have a word with you
in private?

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:26.600
No, Ludwig.
If you've got something to say, say it.

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:30.100
Very well. I heard from the Chief of Police
this evening

01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:33.400
that Himmler has issued a warrant
for your arrest.

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:38.700
You have to leave Germany tonight.

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:41.800
When we succeed
with the central solution,

01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:44.400
you'll return as chancellor.

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:48.200
Disappear, Carl.
Avoid contact with anyone.

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:05.200
Good luck, Colonel.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.900
No more indecision.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.500
From now on,
Stauffenberg has full discretion.

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:19.800
I can't issue the alert again
unless we follow through.

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:23.100
I'll do my job. You just take Berlin.

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:33.200
<i>Hold on, sir.</i>
<i>I'll try to connect you right now.</i>

01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:34.700
Thank you.

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:36.300
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello?

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:39.000
Hello?

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.200
Hello?

01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:49.100
<i>I'm sorry, sir. There is bombing in Ebingen.</i>
<i>We've been disconnected.</i>

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:54.100
<i>Ebingen is a long way from Bamberg.</i>
<i>I'm sure your family is safe.</i>

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.600
Thank you.

01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:36.100
Welcome, Colonel.

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:39.300
Do you have a place
where I could change, Major?

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.700
Please follow me.

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:51.000
At least put the Reserve Army
on standby alert.

01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:53.100
Not until I've heard from Stauffenberg.
Not until I'm sure.

01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:56.600
- But that's not what he...
- Noted, Colonel. Thank you.

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:11.100
The meeting has been moved up to 12:30.

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:14.100
Mussolini is arriving
on the afternoon train.

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:16.500
- The F端hrer wants to have lunch with him.
- Yes, sir.

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:19.900
Will Mussolini be joining us
in the briefing, sir?

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.400
I only wish he were.

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:24.100
Then some ambitious officer
might take the opportunity

01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:26.300
to shoot that dago bastard.

01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:30.900
Excuse me, General.
I'm expecting an important call.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.200
Could you please have someone come
and get me?

01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:36.000
Even if I'm with the F端hrer.

01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:38.600
- Of course, Colonel.
- Thank you, sir.

01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:41.200
Colonel.

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:16.500
Major Freyend speaking.

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:31.700
Colonel? They insist you hurry.
The briefing's about to begin.

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:34.600
One moment, please, Major.

01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:43.200
Ten minutes.
Two for the walk, one for the checkpoint,

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:45.700
one for the bunker, six to get out.

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:47.900
Plenty of time.

01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:53.700
Excuse me, Colonel.

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:58.700
Sir! The F端hrer's at the briefing!

01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:07.000
The Colonel is changing, Major.

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:13.800
- You understand this can be difficult.
- Of course.

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:30.400
Plenty of time.

01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:58.100
- Get the car.
- But, sir...

01:06:58.100 --> 01:07:00.800
I have everything I need. Get the car.

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:31.500
I can manage this.

01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:46.400
- Where are they going?
- It's too hot.

01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:49.700
The briefing has been moved
to the conference hut.

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:16.700
Major, my injuries
have left me hard of hearing.

01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:19.399
Would you place me
as close to the F端hrer as possible?

01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:21.300
- I'll see what I can do.
- ...against the Red Army.

01:08:22.899 --> 01:08:24.600
Not only have they been advancing
from the east,

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:29.100
but they're coming down on the northern
and the southern fronts as well.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.100
As you can see, my F端hrer,
if the enemy continues at this rate,

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:37.600
the situation in the East Prussian sector
is critical.

01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:41.899
Lack of supplies is continuing
to weaken our main units,

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
and reserves are severely depleted.

01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:47.100
My F端hrer,
you remember Colonel Stauffenberg?

01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:56.600
As you are all aware,

01:08:56.700 --> 01:09:00.600
in the past two days alone,
the 10th Army has given up Ancona,

01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:03.700
the 14th Division has been pushed
out of Livorno.

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:07.500
Army Group Center has already lost
28 of their 40 divisions.

01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:11.500
That is a total of almost 350,000 men.

01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:20.600
Since the Red Army first attacked
nearly a month ago,

01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:24.000
our troops have already been pushed back
to the Polish border.

01:09:25.399 --> 01:09:26.899
Conference hut.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.600
This, compounded with the loss
of the 4th Army in Minsk,

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:33.600
- threatens the entire eastern perimeter.
- Yes, sir.

01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:37.100
We must consider pulling men
from Army Group North Ukraine,

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:38.600
as well as the Romanian...

01:09:44.399 --> 01:09:46.500
...and prevent further losses.

01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:49.500
Unless we can quickly dispatch
new blocking divisions

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:52.700
at vital points along the German right,

01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:55.800
- Army Group will be swallowed...
- Colonel. There's a telephone call for you.

01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:57.300
...by the enemy in less than a fortnight.

01:09:57.300 --> 01:10:01.100
And we run the risk of losing
all the ground we have managed to gain

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:05.100
in the last three years. Our spearhead...

01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:08.100
General Fellgiebel, sir. He says it's urgent.

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:14.100
Yes, General, this is Stauffenberg.

01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:21.800
...Russian air activity has proven just
as impregnable as their ground force.

01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:24.000
- Why?
- My F端hrer...

01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:34.100
In some areas
they outnumber us seven to one.

01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:39.500
If we can afford to give ground
along the Italian front, I further...

01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:44.800
One thing is certain,

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:48.600
the Red Army will continue
an aggressive push west,

01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:49.700
even at the expense...

01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:56.200
In order to rebuild at this...

01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:07.900
...already southwest of D端naburg
and closing on Army Group at Lake Peipus.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.400
If they are not immediately withdrawn,
it will be a catastrophe.

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:37.900
Get in. Drive.

01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:42.400
I have orders from the F端hrer. Drive.

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:45.400
Drive! Drive!

01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:50.300
As you were.

01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:25.200
Get me the War Ministry.
General Olbricht. Olbricht!

01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:27.100
The call is urgent!

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:32.700
General Olbricht's office.

01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:34.400
I'm calling from the Wolf's Lair

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:37.200
with an urgent message
for General Olbricht.

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:41.200
Something terrible has happened.
The F端hrer is...

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:44.900
Fellgiebel?

01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:48.100
Sever all communications.

01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:49.800
- Sir?
- Just do it!

01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:57.000
- Well, what did he say?
- I couldn't be sure.

01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:00.500
Well, get him back on the line.

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:05.100
Sir, the bomb did go off.
That much was clear.

01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:08.200
Fellgiebel's next step will be
to sever all communications.

01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:22.000
- Sorry, Colonel. No one gets in or out.
- We have an order from the F端hrer.

01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:24.300
We have to get to the airfield immediately.
Open the gate.

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.100
I'm very sorry,
but my orders are to keep the gate...

01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:30.100
- I just gave you an order, Sergeant.
- Sir!

01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:32.300
Sir. Excuse me.

01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:43.000
Colonel Stauffenberg
for Field Marshal Keitel.

01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:52.400
Colonel Stauffenberg was explicit.
We initiate Valkyrie regardless.

01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:54.100
Only Fromm can initiate. You know that.

01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:57.100
Then tell him Hitler's dead.
Or arrest him. But do it now.

01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:01.100
Sir, you have to give the order
to initiate Valkyrie. This is our only...

01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:03.200
I'm not doing anything
until I hear from Fellgiebel.

01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:04.600
Get him back on the phone now.

01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:07.000
Every second we stand here arguing
is a second lost.

01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:08.500
The risk is too great.

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:11.500
What about Stauffenberg?
What about his risk?

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:13.900
He did his part,
and now you're abandoning him.

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:18.500
Field Marshal, sir. Stauffenberg here.
A Sergeant...

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:19.800
Kolbe, sir.

01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:21.600
- What?
- Kolbe.

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:24.200
...Kolbe won't let me pass the main gate.

01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:26.300
Yes, sir, I explained that.

01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:29.100
Perhaps you can
make him understand, sir.

01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:37.100
Everything's fine now, sir. Thank you.

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:42.000
Open the gate!

01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:54.000
- At least put the Reserve Army on alert.
- When Stauffenberg returns,

01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:58.400
when he gives me confirmation
that Hitler is dead, then we'll proceed.

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:08.800
- And where are you going?
- The same place as you are. Lunch.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.900
Another standby alert.

01:16:55.700 --> 01:16:58.400
Send it through. But keep me informed.

01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:25.300
Sir. Another standby order.

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:31.900
In ancient Greece,
you would have been killed for this.

01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:35.200
Lucky for you we've evolved.

01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:40.200
Assemble the men.

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:31.000
Quiet, isn't it?

01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:35.500
I'll see where our driver is.

01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:40.400
This is von Haeften.
The Colonel and I are at the airfield.

01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:42.000
There's no car. There's no one here.

01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:47.500
You mean to tell me
the alert's only just gone out?

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:50.000
This is Stauffenberg.
Get me General Olbricht.

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:00.100
What's this?

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.600
- Explain this!
- Someone had to do something

01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:09.700
while you were playing dead!

01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:10.800
We don't know that Hitler is not alive.

01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:14.000
This is about Germany, for God's sake,
not you!

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.900
General Olbricht's office.
Colonel Stauffenberg. For you, sir.

01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:38.300
- This is Olbricht.
- It's been three hours, Olbricht.

01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:39.600
What the hell have you been doing?

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
We've had no confirmation
that Hitler was dead.

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:48.600
Damn it! I saw the explosion myself!
We are committed.

01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:52.300
- Dear God.
- Now, where is Fromm? Is he with us?

01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:55.900
- Is he with us?
- No one has spoken to him yet.

01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:12.100
You listen to me. Never mind Germany.
Never mind Europe.

01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:14.400
Your life is at stake now.

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:16.900
And if you want to live through the night,
you'll do exactly as I say.

01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:20.100
The second you hang up the phone,
initiate Valkyrie in Fromm's name.

01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:23.100
Give him the choice to join us,
or place him under immediate arrest.

01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:25.100
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:28.100
I'll be in Fromm's office in 15 minutes.
Be there when I arrive.

01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:03.200
Call Beck and the others.
Tell them it's time.

01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:11.300
Put me through to Communications.

01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:13.800
This is General Olbricht,

01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:18.100
calling on behalf of General Fromm,
commander of the Reserve Army.

01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:20.500
The F端hrer, Adolf Hitler, is dead.

01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:22.100
A group of radicals in the SS

01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:24.600
are attempting to seize control
of the government.

01:21:24.700 --> 01:21:26.900
Initiate Operation Valkyrie.

01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:06.300
You have your orders. Pass them along.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.700
Battalion. Attention!

01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:53.800
The F端hrer...

01:22:56.700 --> 01:22:58.900
Our F端hrer, Adolf Hitler,

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:03.800
is dead.

01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:09.100
- Who told you the F端hrer was dead?
- General Fellgiebel. At the Wolf's Lair.

01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:14.300
There's no use calling.
All communication lines are down.

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:17.500
- Yes. Get me the Wolf's Lair.
- One moment, sir.

01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:23.000
Wolf's Lair. May I connect you?

01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:26.400
Yes. General Fromm
for Field Marshal Keitel. Urgent.

01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:33.800
- Keitel.
- Yes, I'm sorry to disturb you, sir,

01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:35.600
but I wonder if you could tell me
what's happening.

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:38.400
The most incredible rumors
are circulating in Berlin.

01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:40.000
I don't know what you mean.

01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:43.400
There's talk
that the F端hrer has been assassinated.

01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:46.600
Another failed attempt.

01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:49.800
The F端hrer was never in danger.

01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:53.200
By the way,
where's your man Stauffenberg?

01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:57.900
Stauffenberg? He...
On his way back to Berlin, I would think.

01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:01.900
Let me know when he arrives.
I'd like a word with him.

01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:12.700
- The F端hrer's fine.
- That is a lie. Adolf Hitler's dead.

01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:16.400
- Operation Valkyrie is in effect.
- Only I can initiate Valkyrie.

01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:17.700
You did.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.000
This is treason.

01:24:28.100 --> 01:24:30.900
Right now, the Reserve Army's
assuming control of Berlin.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.700
Are you with us or not?

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:35.400
Do you realize what you've done?

01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:37.500
- The F端hrer is alive.
- I delivered the bomb myself.

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:39.800
I saw the blast. He is dead.

01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:45.100
- Are you with us?
- I don't believe this is happening.

01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:48.500
- This is some kind of a joke.
- Are you with us or not?

01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:53.900
Colonel, if what you say is true,
you should shoot yourself immediately.

01:24:53.900 --> 01:24:57.500
- The rest of you are under arrest.
- No, General. You are.

01:25:03.100 --> 01:25:06.000
I don't know where you think this is going.

01:25:08.900 --> 01:25:10.600
Get me Operations.

01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:13.300
This is Colonel Stauffenberg.

01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:15.800
Seal off the War Ministry
per Operation Valkyrie.

01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:16.900
No one gets in or out

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.500
without authorization
from General Olbricht's office.

01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:41.700
General Beck.
You're not wearing your uniform, sir.

01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:44.900
This should be seen
as a movement of the people.

01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:53.800
- Colonel Stauffenberg?
- Yes.

01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:02.400
The chief has guaranteed
the full support of the Berlin Police.

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:08.100
You will have no interference
from my men. You have my word.

01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:12.900
Thank you.

01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:52.100
Colonel Stauffenberg, sir.
We are reporting for duty.

01:26:57.700 --> 01:26:59.600
Thank you for coming.

01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:08.000
Gentlemen, in three hours
I want confirmation

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.900
that the government quarter is ours

01:27:09.900 --> 01:27:13.300
and SS Command has been cleared
of every living soul.

01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:16.300
You all know what must be done.

01:27:17.100 --> 01:27:19.600
By nightfall, I want to know
that Hitler's Germany

01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:21.500
has seen its last sunrise.

01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:55.200
Yes, sir.
All replacements have been authorized.

01:27:55.300 --> 01:27:56.700
In fact, Field Marshal Witzleben

01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:58.700
has been appointed Commander-in-Chief
of the Armed Forces.

01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:01.200
That's exactly why he's been appointed.

01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:03.800
If he was a member of the Party,
he'd be locked up as a suspect.

01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:06.100
Yes, sir, I understand your concern,
but this is an emergency.

01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:07.900
The commanding officer
at the 11th District, please.

01:28:07.900 --> 01:28:09.000
I need a decision, Major.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.100
Tell your men that acts of vengeance
will not be tolerated.

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:12.900
Why hasn't anyone occupied
the Tegel broadcasting station?

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:14.700
Can I speak to the commanding officer
in Hannover, please?

01:28:14.700 --> 01:28:16.000
We represent
a different form of government.

01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:17.500
I'd be careful who you said that to.

01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:19.100
Loyalty to the Party
isn't what it used to be.

01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:22.000
- Yes, Paris. France.
- Not since they murdered the F端hrer.

01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:23.600
And, Josef. Thank you.

01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:25.100
You've made the right decision.

01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:28.200
District 13 is ours.

01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:42.300
By order of Field Marshal von Witzleben,

01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:45.600
you are under arrest
for crimes against the state.

01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:56.700
This is Stauffenberg. I'm trying to
connect with Major-General Thadden.

01:28:56.800 --> 01:28:58.200
No, I've already spoken to 413 Battalion.

01:28:58.300 --> 01:28:59.900
You'll have no trouble
getting reinforcements.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.900
The order explaining everything
will be in your hand shortly.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.600
No, these are your orders. Excellent.

01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:09.200
My wife is in Bamberg with my children.

01:29:09.300 --> 01:29:10.700
Would you please try to raise them
on the phone?

01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:12.800
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:14.800
General Schwedler
has issued the Valkyrie orders

01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:15.900
and has sealed off headquarters.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.900
Good. Check on the radio stations
every 20 minutes

01:29:17.900 --> 01:29:20.200
till we have confirmation they're ours.

01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:35.300
Well, with all due respect, sir,
you can't believe everything you hear.

01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:37.200
That is SS propaganda. He's dead.

01:29:37.300 --> 01:29:41.300
Only the commander of the Home Army
is authorized to give orders.

01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:43.600
General? Sir.

01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:46.400
- Hello, Christian?
- Our men in the transport offices

01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:48.000
have secured
the railway communications network,

01:29:48.100 --> 01:29:49.100
but there are repeater stations...

01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:51.100
- Yes. I give you my word.
...telephone and telegraph offices,

01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:53.300
emergency broadcast outposts.
We need more men.

01:29:53.300 --> 01:29:55.900
Thank you. Give my best to your family.

01:29:55.900 --> 01:29:57.400
He's with us.

01:29:58.300 --> 01:29:59.500
Mertz? Call Potsdam.

01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:02.100
Tell them to place all available units
under our control.

01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:03.900
You have your men.
Now get control of the radio.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.900
We have control
of the government quarter.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
We don't have Berlin yet.

01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:34.100
- What is it now, Sergeant?
- Arrest orders, sir.

01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:36.100
One from Colonel Stauffenberg
in the War Ministry

01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:38.800
to arrest Reich Minister Goebbels.

01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:43.000
The other is from the Wolf's Lair,
to arrest Colonel Stauffenberg.

01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:50.600
Send them both through.

01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:56.600
Our job is not to interpret orders,
our job is to pass them along, regardless.

01:30:56.700 --> 01:30:59.400
- Yes, but...
- That will be all, Sergeant.

01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:23.300
This is treason! You're all going
to pay for this! Do you hear me?

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:40.400
New arrest orders, sir.
For Stauffenberg and Goebbels.

01:31:41.900 --> 01:31:43.900
Do we arrest them both?

01:31:44.900 --> 01:31:47.400
I would hate to find out
I'm being taken advantage of.

01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:51.100
- You really think it's a coup?
- Of that I am certain.

01:31:51.900 --> 01:31:54.700
What I can't say is which side we're on.

01:31:55.300 --> 01:31:57.100
Come with me.

01:31:57.100 --> 01:32:00.100
District 4, Dresden and Leipzig.
District 12, Wiesbaden. District 9...

01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:01.800
They've had no trouble
getting reinforcements,

01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:04.900
and I rely on you seeing
that this gets done.

01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:09.600
I've just spoken to Colonel Linstow.

01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:13.700
They've arrested 1,200 SS
and Gestapo officials in Paris.

01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:15.300
Not a single shot fired.

01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:19.500
Early reports from Vienna are good.
I'm waiting on word from Prague.

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:21.000
Incredible.

01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:56.000
I'm ready to be connected.

01:33:10.500 --> 01:33:14.600
- Minister Goebbels?
- What can I do for you, Major?

01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:17.800
My battalion has an order
to blockade the government quarter

01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:20.000
and place you under arrest.

01:33:23.300 --> 01:33:26.300
Are you
a dedicated National Socialist, Major?

01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:28.900
Yes, sir.

01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:47.000
Major Remer here. Hello?

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.100
Do you recognize my voice?

01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:58.000
- Yes, my F端hrer.
- Then listen to me very carefully.

01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:03.200
I want these traitors taken alive.

01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:07.000
Yes, my F端hrer.

01:34:11.700 --> 01:34:15.800
You heard what he said.
The F端hrer wants the traitors taken alive.

01:34:18.100 --> 01:34:19.400
Yes, sir.

01:34:44.700 --> 01:34:49.400
It's a coup, all right. We can't afford
to remain neutral any longer.

01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:55.800
You have to make a decision.

01:34:57.500 --> 01:35:00.900
When it's over,
we better wind up on the right side.

01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:08.800
Very well.

01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:13.600
Send through all communications
from the Wolf's Lair.

01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:16.400
Stop all communications
from Stauffenberg.

01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:24.200
Release these men!

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.900
But they're part of the coup.

01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:30.400
I've just been on the phone
with Hitler himself.

01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:33.500
We are the coup, you idiot.
We've been duped.

01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:39.200
We've lost contact with District 11.

01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:46.500
The switchboard is overloaded.
Give it 10 minutes and try again.

01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:53.700
Give me General Bieler, District 11.

01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:55.200
We still need...

01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:57.000
- I don't want to leave any section...
- Keep trying.

01:35:57.100 --> 01:36:00.800
Out of my way. Where is General Fromm?

01:36:04.100 --> 01:36:07.400
General Fromm is no longer in command.
I am.

01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:10.100
Beck? What are you doing here?
What is going on?

01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:13.300
The F端hrer is dead.
The SS are staging a coup.

01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:16.000
We've initiated Operation Valkyrie
to crush the uprising

01:36:16.100 --> 01:36:17.600
and save Hitler's Germany.

01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:21.000
You will present the order to your troops.

01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:24.300
I will do no such thing
until I speak to General Fromm.

01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:27.700
You will follow your orders,
or you are under arrest.

01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:34.800
This is treason. I will take no part.
The F端hrer is not dead.

01:36:35.700 --> 01:36:37.600
- The F端hrer is not dead!
- Stop him!

01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:41.200
The F端hrer is not dead!
The F端hrer is not dead!

01:36:41.300 --> 01:36:44.800
I have sworn an oath! This is treason!

01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:48.000
You all swore an oath!
Listen to what I have to say.

01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:51.600
You are all making a terrible mistake!

01:36:52.500 --> 01:36:54.600
The F端hrer is not dead!

01:36:56.700 --> 01:36:58.900
The F端hrer is not dead!

01:37:00.900 --> 01:37:02.900
Please try my wife again.

01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:13.500
Bamberg, please.

01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:21.900
Take your hands off me!

01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:28.900
Sir.

01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:42.800
Over 215 enemy tanks
have been annihilated

01:37:42.900 --> 01:37:44.800
in the past week alone.

01:37:44.900 --> 01:37:47.500
The air force,
engaged in low-flying offensives

01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:50.000
- on enemy concentrations...
- Lieutenant.

01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:51.200
I can't get through to General Gerlach.

01:37:51.300 --> 01:37:54.500
Send a runner down to his office.
Bring him here.

01:37:57.500 --> 01:37:59.000
Yes, thank you.

01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:01.500
Yes, this is Stauffenberg.

01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:04.000
I was speaking to the General
about five minutes ago.

01:38:04.100 --> 01:38:06.900
He told me he'd return my call.
I've yet to hear from him.

01:38:06.900 --> 01:38:09.500
I trust everything in your district
is under control?

01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:13.800
Hans, I need your answer.
There's no more time for indecision.

01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:16.500
And the General knows I'm waiting?

01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:18.000
I'm ordering you to put him
on the phone immediately.

01:38:18.100 --> 01:38:19.900
The army gave their oath to a liar, Hans.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.600
- Hello?
- One who's broken his own oath...

01:38:22.700 --> 01:38:25.100
- Hello?
...to the people a hundred times over.

01:38:25.100 --> 01:38:27.000
Hans, listen to me...

01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:56.500
This operation has been terminated!
Stand down!

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:05.500
Today, an attempt
was made on the F端hrer's life.

01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:10.000
The F端hrer himself suffered no major
injuries beyond light burns and bruises.

01:39:10.100 --> 01:39:12.500
He resumed his work immediately.

01:39:12.500 --> 01:39:15.100
Those seriously wounded
include General Schmundt,

01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:18.100
Colonel Brandt and staff assistant Berger.

01:39:18.100 --> 01:39:20.600
Lighter injuries were sustained
by General Jodl

01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:23.800
and Generals Korten, Buhle,
Bodenschatz, Heusinger...

01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:27.200
Send the following orders
to all Reserve Army commanders.

01:39:27.300 --> 01:39:30.200
"Broadcast incorrect. F端hrer is dead.

01:39:32.900 --> 01:39:35.600
"Operation Valkyrie still in effect."

01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:40.700
... and, as scheduled, received Mussolini
for an afternoon briefing.

01:39:40.700 --> 01:39:43.500
Long live our F端hrer, Adolf Hitler,

01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:46.800
whom the almighty God
has so visibly blessed today.

01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:52.300
I saw the blast.

01:39:57.100 --> 01:39:58.700
I saw the blast.

01:40:07.900 --> 01:40:11.200
Today an attempt was made
on the F端hrer's life.

01:40:11.300 --> 01:40:15.800
The F端hrer himself suffered no major
injuries beyond light burns and bruises.

01:40:15.900 --> 01:40:18.900
- I'm sorry.
- He resumed his work immediately.

01:40:18.900 --> 01:40:21.700
Those seriously wounded
include General Schmundt,

01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:25.300
Colonel Brandt and staff assistant Berger.

01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:28.500
Lighter injuries were sustained
by General Jodl

01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:32.100
and Generals Korten, Buhle,
Bodenschatz, Heusinger...

01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:40.300
Shortly after the attempt on his life,

01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:42.900
the F端hrer was joined
by Reichsmarschall G旦ring

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.600
and, as scheduled, received Mussolini
for an afternoon briefing.

01:40:46.700 --> 01:40:50.300
Stay tuned for the F端hrer's address
to the German people.

01:40:50.300 --> 01:40:51.700
My family?

01:40:53.100 --> 01:40:55.100
Our lines have been cut.

01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:02.300
- I'm sorry.
- Go.

01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:05.900
It's all right. Go.

01:41:22.700 --> 01:41:25.600
General. Sir.
We have to get you out of here.

01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:54.400
Get him out of here.

01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:56.200
- Stop!
- Stand down!

01:42:56.300 --> 01:42:58.600
- I said stop!
- I said stand down!

01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:27.700
Hold your fire!

01:43:36.900 --> 01:43:38.700
Colonel Stauffenberg?

01:43:42.100 --> 01:43:45.100
By orders of the F端hrer,
you're under arrest.

01:44:07.900 --> 01:44:11.300
If you have any last messages
to your wives and children,

01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:13.200
I will hear them now.

01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:16.600
Very well.

01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:18.800
A court-martial convened by me
in the F端hrer's absence

01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:21.900
will pronounce sentence.
Beck, you're under arrest.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:27.300
Colonel Mertz von Quirnheim,
General Olbricht, Lieutenant Haeften,

01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:29.600
and the Colonel
whose name I will not mention,

01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:31.100
are condemned to death.

01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:33.600
General. My orders are
to take these men alive.

01:44:33.700 --> 01:44:35.200
Noted, Major.

01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:38.900
I'd like a pistol, please.

01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:43.500
For personal reasons.

01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:03.300
Get on with it.

01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:05.600
- With all respect...
- That will be all, Major.

01:45:05.700 --> 01:45:08.000
Killing us won't hide your involvement.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:11.300
My involvement?
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:14.200
- You knew and did nothing.
- You're as guilty as any of us.

01:45:14.300 --> 01:45:18.100
- Spare me, Lieutenant.
- No one will be spared.

01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:36.100
I'm thinking of earlier times.

01:45:42.100 --> 01:45:45.700
This is an outrage that has never before
been perpetrated here!

01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:50.800
A field marshal and a general declare
that they could do things better

01:45:50.900 --> 01:45:53.600
than he who is the F端hrer of us all!

01:45:53.700 --> 01:45:57.300
- You confess to having said this?
- Yes.

01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:07.000
My fellow Germans.
I speak to you tonight for two reasons.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:12.300
First, so that you can hear my voice
and know that I am unhurt.

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:17.300
Second, so that you may know
the details of a crime

01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:19.100
without parallel in German history.

01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:24.800
A small clique of ambitious,
dishonorable officers

01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:27.100
have conspired to eliminate me.

01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:34.200
Except for a few bruises and burns,
I was completely untouched.

01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:38.500
I see in this the hand of Providence,

01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:42.300
directing me to complete my work.

01:46:51.900 --> 01:46:53.800
Look them in the eye.

01:46:55.900 --> 01:46:58.100
They'll remember you.

01:46:58.200 --> 01:46:59.600
Olbricht!

01:47:09.900 --> 01:47:11.400
Make ready.

01:47:26.900 --> 01:47:30.900
Well, we have to show the world
that not all of us were like him.

01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:38.300
Safe! Stand!

01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:43.500
Fire!

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:46.200
Stand!

01:48:07.500 --> 01:48:09.000
Stauffenberg!

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:16.500
The people know we put our principles
above personal gain.

01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:17.900
Make ready!

01:48:21.700 --> 01:48:22.800
Aim!

01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:41.200
Safe! Stand!

01:48:47.700 --> 01:48:51.100
You may hand us over to the executioner,

01:48:51.100 --> 01:48:52.800
but in three months' time,

01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:56.800
the disgusted and harried people
will bring you to book

01:48:56.800 --> 01:49:00.900
and drag you alive
through the dirt in the streets.

01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:02.800
Take him away.

01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:10.600
Make ready.

01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:14.100
Aim.

01:49:15.400 --> 01:49:17.700
- Long live sacred Germany!
- Fire!

01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:20.600
Stand.
