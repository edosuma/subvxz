WEBVTT

02:02.730 --> 02:04.425
Passengers will please to descend.

02:04.599 --> 02:05.759
- Papers!
- Flowers.

02:05.934 --> 02:09.233
- Passengers will please to descend.
- Papers from all parts of Europe!

02:09.404 --> 02:12.999
- This way for passport examination, please.
- Paper, mister?

02:13.174 --> 02:16.473
- This way for passport examination.
- Special rates for the coronation.

02:16.644 --> 02:18.976
Special high rates.

02:21.282 --> 02:24.046
"Rudolf Rassendyll, British subject.

02:24.452 --> 02:26.886
Purpose of visit, pleasure."

02:27.422 --> 02:31.688
- What hotel in Strelsau, Mr. Rassendyll?
- I hadn't thought about it.

02:31.859 --> 02:35.226
You better think about it,
if you don't wanna sleep in the park.

02:35.763 --> 02:38.857
In that case, I won't go to Strelsau
until after the coronation.

02:39.067 --> 02:41.092
I've come to your country
for a rest...

02:41.269 --> 02:43.669
...with the intention of
going fishing for trout.

02:48.409 --> 02:51.469
I beg your pardon,
have I said anything I shouldn't?

03:04.158 --> 03:06.285
I know my clothes
are a little conservative...

03:06.461 --> 03:10.261
...but we English always dress as if
we're going to a funeral when on a holiday.

03:10.665 --> 03:12.292
Everything is quite in order.

03:12.700 --> 03:15.931
Thank you for making me feel
so much at home.

03:23.311 --> 03:25.711
- I'll take these. Thanks.
- But your train's going.

03:25.880 --> 03:28.542
I'm going to Strelsau on foot
in my own good time.

03:29.017 --> 03:32.885
- But you'll miss the coronation, sir.
- I make a point of missing coronations.

03:35.723 --> 03:38.521
I hope your trout take as much
interest in me as you do.

03:38.693 --> 03:40.752
I shan't be able
to land them fast enough.

04:09.157 --> 04:11.785
It's a trick of the devil.

04:15.063 --> 04:17.190
Shave him, and he'd be the king.

04:17.765 --> 04:20.495
May I ask your name, sir?

04:20.668 --> 04:24.468
Well, since you've taken the first step
in the acquaintance, gentlemen...

04:24.639 --> 04:27.199
...perhaps you'd give me a lead
in the matter of names.

04:27.375 --> 04:32.108
Well, certainly. This is Colonel Zapt,
and I am called Fritz von Tarlenheim.

04:32.280 --> 04:35.249
We are both in the service
of His Majesty the king.

04:35.416 --> 04:38.044
I'm Rudolf Rassendyll.
I'm here on holiday from England.

04:38.219 --> 04:40.779
I was recently in the service
of Her Majesty the queen.

04:40.955 --> 04:42.616
- Rassendyll?
- How do you do.

04:42.790 --> 04:44.917
- How do you do.
- Rassendyll.

04:45.093 --> 04:49.223
Of course. By heaven,
your face betrays you, sir.

04:49.497 --> 04:53.695
- You know his history, I believe.
- Well, I had heard a rumor or two.

04:54.469 --> 04:58.132
I was hoping that our skeleton
was safe at home in our family cupboard.

04:59.006 --> 05:01.839
Some skeletons
are prodigious travelers, sir.

05:02.009 --> 05:04.068
- Fritz, where are you?
- Here, Your Majesty.

05:04.412 --> 05:07.904
Confound it, I thought
you'd lost yourselves again.

05:08.783 --> 05:12.514
- Who is this gentleman?
- A distant relative of yours, Your Majesty.

05:16.124 --> 05:19.582
Distant? He seems too close for comfort.

05:20.194 --> 05:22.992
That is something for which
you cannot entirely blame me.

05:23.531 --> 05:25.465
Oh, then who shall I blame?

05:25.633 --> 05:29.069
With Your Majesty's permission, I
would suggest the blame lies equally...

05:29.237 --> 05:33.230
...between your
great-great-great-grandfather Rudolf...

05:33.407 --> 05:37.741
...and my
great-great-great-grandmother Amelia.

05:38.579 --> 05:40.774
- I beg your pardon.
- He's right, Your Majesty.

05:40.948 --> 05:45.078
- The man is a Rassendyll from England.
- Rassendyll? England?

05:45.853 --> 05:48.583
Yes, Your Majesty.
Ever since Amelia's time...

05:48.756 --> 05:53.216
...the Elphberg face has cropped out
on one of us every now and then.

05:56.330 --> 05:58.093
Well met, cousin!

05:58.266 --> 06:00.063
Forgive me
if I seemed a little slow...

06:00.234 --> 06:04.796
...but it's a bit early in the day to
see double, even for me. Eh, Zapt?

06:04.972 --> 06:08.601
- What are you doing here, cousin?
- I must admit to being guilty...

06:08.776 --> 06:12.075
...of the same offense
as our mutual ancestor, Your Majesty.

06:12.580 --> 06:16.641
- And what was that?
- Fishing in forbidden waters.

06:20.988 --> 06:24.549
That's very funny. That's funny.
The man has wit.

06:24.725 --> 06:26.590
You must come
to my coronation tomorrow.

06:26.761 --> 06:29.958
I'd give a thousand crowns
for the sight of brother Michael's face...

06:30.131 --> 06:31.826
...when he sees the pair of us.

06:32.300 --> 06:35.667
You shall stay at my hunting lodge.
Tonight, we shall dine you royally.

06:36.003 --> 06:40.497
Our ancestors laid down some good wine
here in the lodge, cousin. Fritz.

06:40.675 --> 06:44.133
They little thought that a bottle or two
was laid down for you.

06:44.312 --> 06:47.679
All in the family. All in the family.

06:54.322 --> 06:57.655
- Cousin Rudolf, I propose a toast.
- Hear, hear.

06:58.426 --> 07:00.257
Another toast.

07:00.528 --> 07:02.723
A toast to...

07:04.432 --> 07:08.266
- Have we anybody left?
- Your brother, Michael, perhaps?

07:09.170 --> 07:13.163
We drink to Michael in vinegar,
my friend, not in good wine.

07:13.341 --> 07:15.935
I'll tell you a secret
about my brother Michael.

07:16.110 --> 07:19.443
- My brother Michael does not love me.
- No?

07:19.814 --> 07:22.681
No. But he loves my shoes.

07:22.850 --> 07:26.479
He feels that he should be in my shoes,
and I should be in his.

07:26.654 --> 07:28.952
No. No toast for Michael.

07:29.123 --> 07:32.388
We'll drink instead to Cousin Flavia.

07:32.560 --> 07:34.687
Soon to be my bride and queen.

07:35.162 --> 07:36.595
Hear, hear.

07:38.165 --> 07:41.862
Poor Flavia. See never had a chance
to choose anybody else.

07:42.036 --> 07:44.004
Well, for that matter, neither did I.

07:44.171 --> 07:46.002
It's a pity
you can't meet the princess.

07:46.173 --> 07:49.404
At least I'm told it's a pity.
I haven't seen her for years.

07:49.577 --> 07:54.514
She and I didn't get on very well then.
Still let's hope we shall now.

07:54.682 --> 07:58.345
I sincerely hope so, Your Majesty,
if you're going to marry her.

08:00.421 --> 08:04.084
They tell me she's far too good for me.
I can well believe it.

08:04.458 --> 08:08.360
You know what they say about me,
don't you? I drink too much.

08:08.963 --> 08:12.763
I imagine you're well able to take care
of yourself on that score, Your Majesty.

08:13.100 --> 08:18.231
Oh, I've done my fair share of drinking
in my day. I'd be the last to deny it.

08:18.673 --> 08:20.573
But tomorrow...

08:20.741 --> 08:22.675
...in the cathedral...

08:22.843 --> 08:28.440
...when my people place the crown upon
my head and proclaim me their king...

08:28.616 --> 08:32.450
...I shall be their king
for the rest of my life.

08:33.254 --> 08:34.744
But tonight...

08:35.222 --> 08:38.316
Tonight, I drink with my friends.

08:44.832 --> 08:46.732
With my friend.

08:49.503 --> 08:53.064
You know, Rassendyll, I like you.

08:53.240 --> 08:55.071
You're a good fellow.

08:55.643 --> 08:59.545
Oh, you're English,
but you're a good fellow.

08:59.714 --> 09:02.046
I wanna drink a toast to you.

09:03.250 --> 09:08.654
Confound it, where's all the wine gone to?
Josef! Josef!

09:09.023 --> 09:12.322
A bottle of the '68. Josef!

09:12.560 --> 09:16.587
Your Majesty, it is my duty to remind you
once more of tomorrow.

09:16.764 --> 09:18.459
- What, again?
- Yes, again.

09:18.632 --> 09:21.601
Well, then, you've reminded me.
Sit down, have a drink.

09:21.769 --> 09:25.330
- You have a duty, Your Majesty.
- Duty, duty. On my last night of freedom?

09:25.506 --> 09:28.134
I question your freedom
to drink yourself into a condition...

09:28.309 --> 09:30.300
...in which you'll not be fit
to be crowned.

09:30.878 --> 09:33.540
I question your right
to address me in that manner.

09:33.714 --> 09:37.241
- I served your father in...
- I question your right to mention my father.

09:37.418 --> 09:39.682
Your father honored his obligations
to the crown.

09:44.358 --> 09:46.451
Are you suggesting that I do not?

09:46.894 --> 09:49.863
Your father never thought of himself,
or of his own pleasure.

09:50.564 --> 09:53.431
Your father never forgot he was a king.

09:58.139 --> 10:00.630
By your leave, Your Majesty.

10:04.111 --> 10:06.705
Zapt? Zapt?

10:14.522 --> 10:15.819
What are you doing here?

10:15.990 --> 10:19.949
The 1868, Your Majesty.
You sent for it.

10:20.127 --> 10:22.425
Oh, did I?

10:23.531 --> 10:26.022
- Josef.
- Yes, Your Majesty?

10:26.200 --> 10:28.031
I've had too much to drink.

10:28.202 --> 10:31.433
- You'd better take it back.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

10:31.605 --> 10:34.768
No, wait, wait, we have a guest.

10:34.942 --> 10:37.775
Excellent fellow, Josef. English.

10:42.149 --> 10:45.448
Excellent fellow, Josef,
but he can't drink.

10:45.619 --> 10:49.248
I can drink. I'm the king.

10:58.666 --> 11:00.566
You better go to bed, Josef.

11:00.734 --> 11:03.635
- Good night, Your Majesty.
- Good night.

11:03.871 --> 11:05.634
Sleep well.

11:07.341 --> 11:09.673
Everybody, sleep well.

11:09.977 --> 11:12.844
Everybody sleeps but the king.

11:32.666 --> 11:34.224
Zapt.

11:35.202 --> 11:36.191
Zapt!

12:00.327 --> 12:03.785
- I don't think much of your joke, sir!
- You think it's a joke, do you?

12:05.032 --> 12:08.195
This is no joke, Englishman.

12:12.172 --> 12:14.106
That was quite an evening, wasn't it?

12:14.275 --> 12:17.642
- What happened?
- Josef found him lying here this morning.

12:17.912 --> 12:20.142
You didn't drink
any of this last bottle?

12:20.314 --> 12:24.273
- Not that I know of, no.
- I think you'd know if you had.

12:24.451 --> 12:28.387
- Why? Was it drugged?
- It was.

12:30.824 --> 12:33.520
- Have you sent for a doctor?
- There's none within 10 miles.

12:33.694 --> 12:37.152
A thousand doctors wouldn't take him
to Strelsau. I know the look of it.

12:37.331 --> 12:40.664
He'll not stir for six or seven hours.

12:40.834 --> 12:43.200
But how? Why? Who?

12:43.571 --> 12:45.801
Who else but Michael?

12:46.273 --> 12:50.369
- Michael? His own brother?
- His half brother.

12:51.245 --> 12:55.181
Michael's mother wasn't
exactly acceptable in court circles.

12:55.349 --> 12:58.079
He wants the crown to be
offered to him by the people.

12:58.252 --> 13:02.484
He wants to pose as their savior
from the excesses of an incompetent king.

13:04.291 --> 13:07.988
If he's not crowned today,
he'll never be crowned.

13:14.068 --> 13:18.129
Englishman, I am much older than you.

13:18.405 --> 13:21.738
As a man grows old,
he comes to believe in fate.

13:21.909 --> 13:23.137
Fate sent you here.

13:24.111 --> 13:26.773
- Fate sends you now to Strelsau.
- What?

13:26.981 --> 13:30.178
I'd wager without your moustache,
you could deceive your own brother.

13:32.820 --> 13:36.256
- Oh, you're out of your mind.
- It's a risk, yes...

13:36.924 --> 13:39.324
...against a certainty.

13:39.693 --> 13:44.153
My dear colonel, I came here
on a fishing trip. I like to fish.

13:44.331 --> 13:45.662
I'm an ordinary Englishman.

13:45.833 --> 13:50.133
I couldn't begin to act like a king, even
if I tried. I wouldn't deceive anybody.

13:55.042 --> 13:56.600
What are you smiling at?

13:57.945 --> 14:00.937
It conjures up quite a picture, doesn't it?

14:02.316 --> 14:05.251
The cathedral crowded to the doors...

14:05.452 --> 14:10.446
...the organ booming,
I kneel to be crowned.

14:11.759 --> 14:14.091
Then your friend Michael
steps forward and shouts:

14:14.261 --> 14:17.560
"That isn't the king. That's an Englishman
named Rudolf Rassendyll!"

14:17.731 --> 14:20.199
Oh, no, I'm sorry, gentlemen.

14:20.367 --> 14:25.361
Then Michael sits on the throne tonight,
and the king lies in prison or his grave.

14:35.983 --> 14:40.420
After all, it... It would only
be for today, wouldn't it?

14:40.587 --> 14:42.817
By tonight,
you'll be safely across the border.

14:43.691 --> 14:44.953
And if I fail, what then?

14:45.459 --> 14:49.418
Your life, and mine, and Fritz's here.

14:56.970 --> 15:01.066
Confound it, I'd become
awfully fond of this moustache.

15:22.796 --> 15:26.027
Well, I hope the crown's a better fit.

15:27.434 --> 15:30.767
- Well, what are we going to do?
- We've got to hide him.

15:30.938 --> 15:34.396
We can't chance Michael's men
finding him here.

15:34.575 --> 15:36.839
- The cellar's best. Pick him up.
- If they search...

15:37.010 --> 15:38.375
- Josef will put them off.
- But...

15:38.545 --> 15:40.877
We're not playing. I know the risk.

15:41.048 --> 15:45.178
If they do find him, he'll be no worse off
than if he's not crowned in Strelsau today.

15:45.352 --> 15:46.751
Pick him up.

15:49.757 --> 15:53.193
- I beg your pardon, sir.
- One moment.

15:54.161 --> 15:57.995
- How long have you been caretaker here?
- Ten years.

15:58.165 --> 16:01.396
- Have you the key to the wine cellar?
- Yes, sir.

16:01.568 --> 16:03.160
Open it.

16:40.507 --> 16:43.533
No. No, no.

16:43.977 --> 16:45.535
Drink it.

16:46.180 --> 16:47.169
Drink it!

17:12.172 --> 17:15.335
Tie her up. Better gag her too.

17:28.255 --> 17:32.089
On the night before your coronation,
you had to have wine.

17:32.759 --> 17:35.057
Wine, and more wine.

17:49.576 --> 17:52.807
Remarkable vintage, that '68.

17:52.980 --> 17:54.607
Lock the door.

18:06.560 --> 18:08.892
Sleep well, Your Majesty.

18:09.062 --> 18:11.587
We go to see you crowned.

18:15.769 --> 18:17.498
By heaven, we'll do it yet.

18:20.307 --> 18:24.141
It's not bad. It's not bad at all.

18:25.212 --> 18:27.146
I'll never keep that in.

18:28.949 --> 18:30.746
Look here, you've overlooked one thing.

18:30.918 --> 18:33.216
Yesterday's temples
won't do for today's king.

18:33.387 --> 18:36.823
- You're right. What can we do?
- Well...

18:37.624 --> 18:41.355
...I suggest some bootblacking,
preferably the king's.

18:41.528 --> 18:43.792
I may as well be royal all over.

19:20.968 --> 19:23.562
There. The last detail.

19:23.737 --> 19:26.797
This is to be released
20 minutes after Hentzau brings you word...

19:26.974 --> 19:29.943
...that the coronation ceremonies
have been canceled.

19:30.110 --> 19:33.705
- Twenty minutes, not before.
- Yes, Your Highness.

19:33.880 --> 19:35.871
And now may I offer you
my congratulations.

19:36.483 --> 19:40.317
A shade premature,
but thank you, Detchard.

19:45.993 --> 19:49.087
Gentlemen, it's time for you
to proceed to your posts.

19:49.262 --> 19:50.593
The hour is almost upon us.

19:50.897 --> 19:55.129
We go in the cause of our country,
and our future sovereign.

19:57.037 --> 19:59.665
Our future sovereign, Queen Flavia.

20:06.713 --> 20:09.113
He looked at you when he said
"our future sovereign."

20:09.282 --> 20:10.874
Have you been lying to me, Michael?

20:11.051 --> 20:13.849
- Is it more than the regency you want?
- No, of course not.

20:14.021 --> 20:16.990
As regent, the sovereign power
will be mine. That's all he meant.

20:17.157 --> 20:20.058
Was it? Is power all you want?

20:20.227 --> 20:22.855
- I'm afraid, Michael.
- For me or for yourself?

20:23.030 --> 20:25.464
You promised to make me your wife.

20:27.034 --> 20:31.368
I want to be your wife.
I want to love you and make you happy.

20:31.538 --> 20:34.564
Once you are regent,
they would never let you marry me.

20:34.741 --> 20:37.266
Michael, take the happiness
we can have together.

20:37.444 --> 20:40.242
- Leave the power to your brother.
- No!

20:40.981 --> 20:44.075
I've played second fiddle
to that drunken sot for the last time.

20:44.251 --> 20:46.378
His mother was a princess
and mine was not...

20:46.553 --> 20:49.215
...so he lived in the royal palace,
he dined with kings.

20:49.389 --> 20:51.949
Well, today the feast is set for Rudolf.

20:52.125 --> 20:54.719
But it's Michael who will sit in his place.

20:55.662 --> 20:56.890
Come in.

20:59.099 --> 21:02.068
Count Rupert of Hentzau
at your service, Your Majesty.

21:04.371 --> 21:07.772
- I'm sorry to interrupt you, Your Majesty.
- Hentzau.

21:08.775 --> 21:10.072
Your Highness.

21:10.577 --> 21:14.308
Your wit is as inopportune
as your appearance.

21:14.481 --> 21:16.039
Why are you not at your post?

21:16.216 --> 21:19.982
How can I witness the coronation of a king
who will be conspicuous by his absence?

21:20.153 --> 21:23.122
Do we want to make it obvious
we knew he would not be there?

21:27.160 --> 21:30.652
Incidentally, the burgomaster of Zenda
is outside to pay his respects...

21:30.831 --> 21:33.299
...at the head of
a delegation of loyal peasants.

21:33.467 --> 21:36.994
I told them you were probably too busy
to see them, as of course you are.

21:40.907 --> 21:42.841
There may come a time, Hentzau...

21:43.009 --> 21:46.809
...when your services
will no longer excuse your impertinence.

21:54.921 --> 21:58.721
I called at your hotel again this morning
and as usual they said you were out.

21:58.892 --> 22:01.417
Curiously enough, you were out for once.

22:01.595 --> 22:04.530
I'm glad you stopped lying to me.
I hate being lied to by women.

22:04.698 --> 22:07.428
They never did before.
I always lied to them.

22:07.834 --> 22:11.395
You and I will never have anything
to lie to each other about.

22:11.571 --> 22:15.473
Never? Somebody once called fidelity
the fading woman's greatest weapon...

22:15.642 --> 22:17.610
...the charming woman's
greatest hypocrisy.

22:17.777 --> 22:19.210
And you're very charming...

22:19.379 --> 22:22.246
...to anyone whose head is not
bowed beneath a borrowed crown.

22:22.816 --> 22:26.479
I thought I heard His Highness order you
to your place at the cathedral.

22:27.554 --> 22:29.579
So you're trying
to put me in my place too.

22:29.756 --> 22:31.849
I love arrogance in a woman.

22:32.025 --> 22:36.257
It's always so amusing to discover
that their arrogance is only a defense.

22:36.429 --> 22:40.297
But you need no defense against me.
You and I are allies.

22:40.634 --> 22:43.603
Michael is plotting to betray us both.

22:45.105 --> 22:47.096
Poor Michael,
how he shortchanges himself...

22:47.274 --> 22:49.606
...deserting a warm, exciting
woman of the world...

22:49.776 --> 22:52.336
...for an insipid wax doll.

22:55.348 --> 22:58.249
That was hardly up to your usual standard,
Count Rupert.

22:58.418 --> 23:00.181
I'd heard you were much more subtle.

23:00.620 --> 23:04.112
What makes you think Michael has
any intention of marrying Princess Flavia?

23:04.457 --> 23:08.120
- How else can he get the crown?
- He doesn't want the crown.

23:08.295 --> 23:12.254
As those in his confidence know.
He wants only to be regent.

23:12.532 --> 23:15.763
He's made you think he only wants
to be the man behind the throne? No.

23:15.936 --> 23:17.301
He wants to sit on it.

23:17.470 --> 23:20.598
And sit on it he never can
unless he sits beside the rightful queen.

23:20.774 --> 23:22.332
And that queen is not you.

23:22.809 --> 23:25.778
Even though you'd make a perfect queen.

23:27.214 --> 23:30.911
I'm glad you believe me at last.
I told you we were allies.

23:32.219 --> 23:35.154
I can even help you to win him back.
I'm the only man who can...

23:35.322 --> 23:38.257
...because I'm the only man
who isn't afraid of him.

23:38.425 --> 23:42.452
All you have to do is to give him
genuine cause to be jealous of me.

23:42.629 --> 23:44.460
Would that be hard?

24:15.662 --> 24:19.223
I, Rudolf, with justice and mercy,
to deal sovereignty.

24:19.532 --> 24:25.562
To guard with vigilance and honor the
welfare of my peoples from all enemies...

24:32.178 --> 24:34.738
No, no. Don't tell me.

24:35.882 --> 24:37.474
From all enemies to defend them...

24:37.651 --> 24:41.485
...and from the throne of my ancestors,
to bear faithful rule, all this do I swear.

24:44.557 --> 24:46.582
A little swift, but you'll do.

24:46.760 --> 24:49.490
Stop shaking, lad.
They'll mistake it for a royal hangover.

24:49.663 --> 24:53.030
Now, let me see.
We're all right till the cathedral.

24:53.199 --> 24:56.100
The princess hasn't seen him
for several years. But Michael...

24:57.103 --> 24:59.594
Yeah. Well, I've told you all I can.

24:59.939 --> 25:02.237
I'll be at your side every minute.

25:04.611 --> 25:07.136
Your capital, Your Majesty.

25:21.361 --> 25:23.852
God save the king!

25:25.231 --> 25:27.290
God save the king!

25:27.467 --> 25:30.231
God save them both. Steady, lad.

25:43.650 --> 25:48.246
It's the day, the hour,
almost the moment.

25:48.488 --> 25:51.685
History is born out of a bottle of wine.

25:59.332 --> 26:00.822
The king.

26:19.285 --> 26:22.345
His Majesty has arrived, Your Highness.

26:23.156 --> 26:25.090
The king? How's it possible?

26:25.258 --> 26:28.455
Ride back to Zenda at once.
Find out who betrayed us.

26:28.995 --> 26:31.964
If only he'd drunk
what I wanted to put in that bottle.

28:27.046 --> 28:30.277
Look now upon our liege lord,
Rudolf V...

28:30.650 --> 28:32.743
...undoubted king of this realm.

28:32.919 --> 28:37.447
And if any man would deny our sovereign
lord's title to our lands and fealty...

28:37.624 --> 28:41.924
...let him speak now,
or be attainted traitor.

28:51.437 --> 28:53.803
Receive the crown of the kingdom...

28:53.973 --> 28:59.639
...and understand what a glory of sanctity
and honor and bravery it signifies.

29:02.148 --> 29:03.445
God save the king.

29:03.750 --> 29:05.342
God save the king!

29:05.752 --> 29:07.276
God save the king!

29:07.587 --> 29:10.954
- God save the king!
- God save the king.

29:24.837 --> 29:28.933
I, Rudolf, with justice and mercy
to deal sovereignty...

29:29.375 --> 29:32.970
...to guard with vigilance and honor
the welfare of my peoples...

29:33.413 --> 29:35.904
...from all enemies to defend them...

29:36.115 --> 29:40.017
...and from the throne of my ancestors,
to bear faithful rule...

29:40.186 --> 29:41.949
...all this do I swear.

29:55.368 --> 29:59.099
I, Flavia, do become thy vassal...

29:59.906 --> 30:03.842
...swearing to serve thee in truth
with life and limb...

30:04.510 --> 30:07.035
...until death findeth me...

30:07.313 --> 30:09.611
...so help me God.

30:24.330 --> 30:27.322
- Do I kiss her?
- Yes.

31:29.495 --> 31:33.829
Well, I think everything went off very well,
don't you, for a coronation?

31:34.934 --> 31:38.529
I mean, that is, not that
a coronation shouldn't go well...

31:38.705 --> 31:42.835
...provided the king puts in an appearance
suitably dressed and suitably rehearsed.

31:43.009 --> 31:46.445
- And suitably sober.
- And suitably sober.

31:46.813 --> 31:49.373
Yes, I was hoping you'd notice that.

31:49.549 --> 31:50.777
By the way...

31:50.950 --> 31:54.750
...among my other failings,
I've rather neglected you, haven't I?

31:54.921 --> 31:57.219
Two picture post cards
in three years, I think.

31:57.390 --> 32:01.224
To think, all this time you've been changing
into the loveliest princess in Europe.

32:01.394 --> 32:04.158
No, the loveliest girl in Europe.

32:04.731 --> 32:09.600
Your new responsibilities do not compel you
to shower me with compliments in private.

32:09.769 --> 32:12.067
You call this private?

32:13.740 --> 32:16.868
I'm glad you think I've changed
since you last saw me.

32:17.043 --> 32:19.068
You're different too.

32:19.746 --> 32:23.182
Well, wouldn't anybody seem different
with all this going on?

32:23.349 --> 32:26.318
I probably looked like a prize idiot,
and talked like one too.

32:26.986 --> 32:28.453
You're too modest.

32:28.621 --> 32:30.885
You really looked and acted
like a king today.

32:31.290 --> 32:33.224
Oh, thank you.

32:33.392 --> 32:35.792
It was delightfully unexpected.

32:40.600 --> 32:44.001
- Aren't you forgetting something?
- What?

32:47.273 --> 32:49.002
That's better.

32:50.777 --> 32:53.405
Wait, I've got an idea.

32:53.579 --> 32:57.140
Supposing you bow on my side
of this goldfish bowl...

32:57.316 --> 33:00.217
...and I'll salute on yours.

33:00.987 --> 33:02.579
Like that.

33:03.890 --> 33:06.757
There, isn't that more cozy?

33:19.672 --> 33:21.902
They seem to like that.

33:34.687 --> 33:36.746
Bless them.
They're with you heart and soul.

33:36.923 --> 33:38.857
Me? It was you they were cheering.

33:39.025 --> 33:41.994
I felt like cheering you too
when I first saw you.

33:43.262 --> 33:45.059
- Everyone's waiting...
- Oh, no, please.

33:45.231 --> 33:48.462
Don't go yet. It's such a relief
to have you to myself for a moment.

33:48.634 --> 33:53.333
All day long I've been on parade.
Cheered at, waved at, stared at.

33:53.773 --> 33:55.502
Not a moment to tell you...

33:55.675 --> 33:57.404
Tell me what?

33:59.145 --> 34:01.272
It's enough to turn
any man's head a bit.

34:01.447 --> 34:04.939
I'm crowned king, I meet the loveliest,
the most beautiful woman.

34:05.117 --> 34:09.520
That isn't what you used to say. You used
to call me "that clumsy little scarecrow."

34:09.688 --> 34:10.781
- I did?
- Yes.

34:10.956 --> 34:13.926
- I should've been horsewhipped.
- Those were my very words.

34:14.092 --> 34:18.154
- Once I kicked you, quite hard.
- Good. I'm sure I deserved it.

34:18.331 --> 34:21.562
But I hope you never find it necessary
to kick me again.

34:21.734 --> 34:24.828
You know, you've changed
beyond all recognition.

34:25.004 --> 34:28.167
It's almost impossible to believe
that anybody could change so much.

34:28.341 --> 34:29.399
And so quickly.

34:29.609 --> 34:32.601
Well, it must be that you
bring out the best in people.

34:32.777 --> 34:36.908
No. You've become
an entirely different person.

34:38.717 --> 34:40.743
They're waiting for us.
We really must go.

34:41.621 --> 34:43.145
Must we?

34:50.696 --> 34:53.824
Another thing I always wanted to know,
is the world outside...

34:54.000 --> 34:57.401
...really as wicked and exciting
as the novels make out?

34:57.570 --> 35:01.973
What did you do on those long trips?
When you weren't drinking, I mean.

35:02.141 --> 35:05.770
Well, when I wasn't drinking,
I used to go fishing.

35:05.945 --> 35:09.346
Fishing? You used to despise fishing.

35:09.515 --> 35:14.316
Well, I did and I didn't, if you follow me.
Have you ever done any trout fishing?

35:14.487 --> 35:16.011
- No, and you know why.
- Oh, I do?

35:16.188 --> 35:18.179
I asked you to teach me.
You sent me home.

35:18.357 --> 35:20.450
I made too many mistakes
and scared the fish.

35:21.827 --> 35:24.227
But once you really hurt me.

35:24.630 --> 35:27.292
- You've forgotten, haven't you?
- I wish you had too.

35:28.634 --> 35:33.469
It was my 14th birthday party.
I had my first formal dress.

35:33.639 --> 35:38.474
I thought I was quite grown up.
You were to be the guest of honor.

35:38.644 --> 35:41.909
I wanted to show you that
the ugly duckling had become a swan.

35:44.250 --> 35:45.717
And what did I do?

35:46.218 --> 35:50.177
At the end when everyone had gone home
and you still hadn't come...

35:51.257 --> 35:53.350
...I hated you.

35:53.526 --> 35:55.892
I'm beginning to hate myself.

35:57.396 --> 35:58.829
Yes?

36:00.733 --> 36:01.722
Well?

36:01.901 --> 36:06.235
His Highness Prince Michael is waiting to
pay his respects to you, Your Majesty.

36:06.572 --> 36:07.698
Well, let him wait.

36:09.575 --> 36:11.509
And furthermore,
Captain von Tarlenheim...

36:11.677 --> 36:14.771
...I find your intrusion
excessively irregular.

36:20.119 --> 36:22.952
Rudolf, it's not wise
to provoke Michael deliberately.

36:23.122 --> 36:26.319
- Oh, why not? Why be worried about him?
- I'm not.

36:26.492 --> 36:30.189
- I'm worried about you.
- Well, that's a different matter altogether.

36:30.363 --> 36:34.424
We can't allow that.
Will you excuse me?

36:37.203 --> 36:41.037
My dear Michael!
I had no idea you'd been kept waiting.

36:41.207 --> 36:44.506
Why was I not informed
of my brother's presence?

36:44.744 --> 36:48.145
I will not tolerate
such inefficiency again, gentlemen.

36:55.755 --> 36:58.883
This is indeed a privilege
worth being kept waiting for, cousin.

36:59.058 --> 37:01.151
It's most kind of you to say so, cousin.

37:01.327 --> 37:04.524
You know, brother,
this was a day I'd really been dreading.

37:04.897 --> 37:07.331
I had a queer feeling
that something might go wrong.

37:07.500 --> 37:10.264
But with you in charge,
my fears were foolish, weren't they?

37:10.436 --> 37:13.371
I can hardly thank you enough
for arranging my affairs.

37:13.539 --> 37:17.771
It's gratifying to find Your Majesty in such
excellent spirits after the strain of the day.

37:17.943 --> 37:20.878
I've never felt so fit in my life.
It must be the excitement.

37:21.047 --> 37:23.811
It's the first time I've ever been crowned,
you know.

37:24.817 --> 37:27.581
Yeah, that's rather funny.
Don't you think so, brother?

37:27.753 --> 37:29.778
- Very funny, indeed.
- Yeah.

37:29.955 --> 37:34.722
There's another reason I feel so well. I had
an extraordinary native wine last night.

37:34.894 --> 37:37.362
Soothed my nerves, slept like a top.

37:37.530 --> 37:39.828
This one comes from very near your castle.

37:40.332 --> 37:43.995
You really ought to try it sometime,
if ever you're troubled with insomnia.

37:44.170 --> 37:46.161
I very seldom suffer with insomnia.

37:46.505 --> 37:49.838
Indeed. That shows what a very
clear conscience you must have.

37:50.009 --> 37:51.374
I have.

37:51.544 --> 37:55.378
I have yet to have a dream that did not
come true, provided I waited long enough.

37:55.548 --> 38:00.383
Yes, of course.
Everything comes to him who waits.

38:03.189 --> 38:05.521
I see I bore Your Majesty.

38:05.891 --> 38:08.325
With Your Majesty's permission,
I bid you good night.

38:17.369 --> 38:21.032
Rudolf, do be careful.
You know how bitterly he hates you.

38:21.207 --> 38:23.675
Well, now he knows
how bitterly I hate him.

38:23.843 --> 38:26.277
You still can't afford
to make an open enemy of him.

38:26.445 --> 38:28.538
He'd stop at nothing,
even now, to ruin you.

38:28.714 --> 38:32.980
Oh, you're overestimating him.
Or perhaps you're underestimating me.

38:33.786 --> 38:38.246
Rudolf, if you won't think of yourself,
think of me.

38:38.424 --> 38:41.359
All my life I've known
what my future had to be...

38:41.527 --> 38:43.859
...and I was resigned to it.

38:44.530 --> 38:48.899
But now... Now I don't have to
tell you how different it is.

38:50.302 --> 38:52.429
Flavia, forgive me.

38:52.605 --> 38:55.403
I had no idea that you might...

38:55.841 --> 38:57.365
That I would...

38:57.943 --> 39:02.846
l... I only want you to realize
how much your life means to...

39:05.050 --> 39:07.143
To your country.

39:08.954 --> 39:10.683
To my country?

39:10.956 --> 39:13.823
- And to your friends.
- My friends?

39:15.094 --> 39:18.586
And to your cousin
and most loving servant.

39:23.502 --> 39:25.561
What else matters?

39:26.805 --> 39:28.864
Good night, Rudolf.

39:29.642 --> 39:33.408
No, don't go. Not yet.
Stay a little longer.

39:34.113 --> 39:36.877
But you'll be seeing me
every day from now on.

39:37.049 --> 39:41.543
You may even get tired of me.
Good night.

39:48.093 --> 39:52.325
No. Goodbye, Flavia.

39:55.401 --> 39:57.835
What a day for you to remember.

39:58.204 --> 40:00.695
I'll never forget old Mueller
at the cathedral.

40:00.873 --> 40:02.670
He used to be the king's tutor.

40:02.841 --> 40:05.071
He fixed his eye on you
and he never took it off.

40:05.244 --> 40:10.011
I was certain the game was up, until
I realized that eye was his glass one.

40:10.916 --> 40:12.281
By the way, Rassendyll...

40:12.451 --> 40:15.318
...what were you doing
with the princess all that time?

40:15.487 --> 40:18.012
Can't you even leave the king
to do his own lovemaking?

40:18.190 --> 40:21.159
That's enough of that.
Are you ready to go, Rassendyll?

40:21.327 --> 40:24.592
We must leave at once if I'm to have
His Majesty back here by daylight.

40:24.763 --> 40:27.561
If anybody comes to see the king,
you're to say he's asleep.

40:27.733 --> 40:30.258
- Yes, sir.
- If it's Michael and that doesn't stop him...

40:30.436 --> 40:33.234
- That'd be awkward.
- So awkward that if that door's forced...

40:33.405 --> 40:36.863
...you're not to be alive to tell about it.
- Do you think I would be, sir?

40:37.977 --> 40:39.945
Good lad. Come on.

40:44.250 --> 40:46.878
Rassendyll, I'm not much good
at speechmaking.

40:47.052 --> 40:48.576
Well, we don't need one, do we?

40:48.754 --> 40:51.587
- Well, you know what I mean.
- Yeah, I think I do, old man.

40:51.757 --> 40:54.282
We have no time for sentiment.

40:54.560 --> 40:57.620
In a few hours time,
I'll be plain Rudolf Rassendyll again.

40:57.796 --> 41:00.594
You'll be lucky if you're not
the late Rudolf Rassendyll.

41:00.766 --> 41:02.927
- Happy thought.
- I feel my head wobbling...

41:03.102 --> 41:05.468
...every minute you're in the city.

41:07.573 --> 41:11.475
In the old king's time, we used this more
often than any other door in the palace.

41:11.644 --> 41:13.578
It saved many a royal head...

41:14.280 --> 41:16.976
...and many a royal reputation. I...

41:17.149 --> 41:18.810
Yes, come on.

41:37.503 --> 41:41.132
No lights, eh? That's odd.

41:47.012 --> 41:48.639
Josef?

41:50.816 --> 41:52.374
Josef!

41:57.790 --> 41:59.485
Josef!

42:03.095 --> 42:04.562
Thank you.

42:31.090 --> 42:33.718
Locked. Here, take this.

42:52.878 --> 42:54.470
The king!

42:54.780 --> 42:56.179
Look!

43:01.787 --> 43:04.517
- Kidnapped.
- Or murdered.

43:10.129 --> 43:14.225
Michael's been in Strelsau all day.
Still is.

43:14.400 --> 43:16.732
Yes, but that young devil Hentzau isn't.

43:16.902 --> 43:20.360
I wondered
why I hadn't seen him all day.

43:20.539 --> 43:22.507
That settles it.
Now they know everything.

43:22.674 --> 43:25.802
Yes, they know everything,
but they can't speak.

43:25.978 --> 43:28.378
They can't denounce us
without denouncing themselves.

43:28.547 --> 43:31.675
Can they say, "That wasn't the king
because we kidnapped the king...

43:31.850 --> 43:34.011
...and murdered his servant"?
Can they say that?

43:34.186 --> 43:37.587
No. But that won't prevent them
murdering the king.

43:37.823 --> 43:41.054
With you in Strelsau, they won't dare.

43:41.427 --> 43:43.361
If they do, they're finished.

43:43.529 --> 43:46.191
Can they kill him
and leave you on the throne?

43:47.933 --> 43:51.869
No, you're asking too much.

43:52.504 --> 43:54.904
No man could carry on
this masquerade indefinitely.

43:55.073 --> 43:56.938
I've done everything I can
to help but...

43:57.109 --> 44:01.307
Yes, I suppose you're right. You've done
everything that could be expected.

44:01.480 --> 44:04.278
More than could be expected.

44:04.550 --> 44:06.279
It's just that...

44:08.153 --> 44:10.348
Rudolf is my king.

44:10.522 --> 44:13.548
I have a feeling about the crown.

44:14.493 --> 44:18.862
I suppose I feel about it as another man
might feel about the woman he loved.

44:21.333 --> 44:25.235
He wouldn't like to leave her to her fate
without even a fight.

44:25.404 --> 44:27.736
What will happen to her now?

44:28.740 --> 44:31.402
- Princess Flavia?
- Yes.

44:32.010 --> 44:36.970
If the king has been murdered, Michael
as regent will proclaim her queen.

44:37.149 --> 44:40.516
And then... marry her.

44:41.286 --> 44:42.719
She'd never submit to that.

44:43.021 --> 44:46.320
Flavia is a princess of the royal house.
She'd have no choice.

44:46.492 --> 44:48.460
She would expect none.

44:51.063 --> 44:53.395
And will you stand by
and let that happen to her?

44:58.136 --> 44:59.694
Will you?

45:47.152 --> 45:50.610
His Majesty, the king.

46:46.211 --> 46:48.179
Your Majesty.

46:48.914 --> 46:51.314
Oh, I'm delighted to see you.

47:37.162 --> 47:39.790
Rudolf, are you worried about something?

47:39.965 --> 47:43.059
Worried? With you in my arms?

47:43.568 --> 47:46.298
I was thinking there'll never be
another night like this...

47:46.471 --> 47:47.995
...or another waltz like this.

47:48.173 --> 47:52.007
I'll never forget tonight as long as I live,
if that's what you mean.

47:53.078 --> 47:54.841
Nor will I.

48:00.519 --> 48:02.680
Do you have to dance with
anybody else tonight?

48:02.854 --> 48:05.789
I dance only as my king commands.

48:05.957 --> 48:08.824
Well, then your king commands that...

48:18.704 --> 48:20.103
Why do they all stop?

48:20.272 --> 48:23.730
- You know the rule. Because we do.
- And you mean that...

48:23.909 --> 48:26.969
...if we start, they'll go on?
- Of course.

48:41.593 --> 48:43.993
If we go out on the terrace,
will they come out too?

48:44.162 --> 48:46.926
- Of course not.
- Well, then.

48:50.335 --> 48:53.031
- Let's go out on the terrace.
- Oh, not now.

48:53.205 --> 48:55.935
- Later?
- Later.

49:06.151 --> 49:08.676
That is, if we can slip away.

49:09.621 --> 49:11.714
Oh, no.

49:11.890 --> 49:14.120
I want that promise.

49:18.513 --> 49:19.810
Come, we must dance.

49:19.981 --> 49:24.884
- Not a step until I get that promise.
- I promise.

49:37.198 --> 49:39.996
The British ambassador, newly appointed.
Do you know him?

49:40.168 --> 49:42.602
- Yes.
- Let us trust in Providence.

49:42.770 --> 49:45.671
You'll never get Providence interested
in this enterprise.

49:47.442 --> 49:49.205
Your Majesty, Your Royal Highness...

49:49.377 --> 49:52.005
...His Excellency the British Ambassador
and Lady Topham.

49:52.180 --> 49:53.272
Your Excellencies.

49:58.786 --> 50:00.048
Your Majesty.

50:00.221 --> 50:02.121
Her Britannic Majesty
the Queen Empress...

50:02.290 --> 50:05.521
...commands me to convey
her felicitations upon your coronation.

50:05.693 --> 50:08.787
Be pleased to convey
our thanks to Her Majesty.

50:08.963 --> 50:11.523
You may also add our felicitations
upon her jubilee.

50:11.866 --> 50:14.562
Your Majesty, would it be premature
to congratulate you...

50:14.736 --> 50:16.704
...upon Your Majesty's
approaching wedding?

50:18.540 --> 50:21.031
Well, yes, it might be.

50:24.312 --> 50:28.510
Rudolf, we should pay our respects
to His Eminence the Cardinal.

50:35.757 --> 50:38.988
Amazing resemblance
to the younger Rassendyll.

50:39.994 --> 50:42.258
Not the slightest.

50:43.865 --> 50:46.299
Your Eminence
has greatly honored us tonight.

50:46.467 --> 50:49.766
Your Majesty's subjects
already love their king.

50:49.938 --> 50:53.567
I think they're impatient
to love their queen as well.

50:53.741 --> 50:57.006
I'm grateful for the interest of the people
and of Your Eminence.

50:57.178 --> 50:58.736
Graciously answered.

50:58.913 --> 51:01.677
And now,
the preparations for the ceremony...

51:01.849 --> 51:04.716
...of necessity are going to be
many and elaborate.

51:04.886 --> 51:08.219
Would it please Your Majesty
to name the date?

51:10.358 --> 51:11.552
Now? Tonight?

51:11.859 --> 51:15.454
It was understood that the ceremony
would shortly follow the coronation.

51:17.498 --> 51:20.797
Well, shall we say, in six months' time?

51:21.336 --> 51:22.963
So long a postponement?

51:24.739 --> 51:26.866
Your Eminence, there's an old proverb...

51:27.041 --> 51:31.205
...which councils us against crossing
bridges before we come to them.

51:31.479 --> 51:33.504
If Your Majesty would examine
that proverb...

51:33.681 --> 51:39.085
...I think you would find it very difficult
to cross a bridge at any other time.

51:41.222 --> 51:43.247
Well, I'm sure my cousin will understand.

51:44.692 --> 51:47.593
Your cousin begs leave
to bid Your Majesty...

51:48.363 --> 51:50.160
...and Your Eminence good night.

51:50.331 --> 51:54.927
- Good night, my child.
- If you will excuse us, Your Eminence.

51:56.804 --> 51:58.135
Flavia...

51:58.339 --> 52:00.739
...you promised to go out
on the terrace with me.

52:00.908 --> 52:05.277
- Is that a command, Your Majesty?
- That's a command...

52:05.446 --> 52:07.539
...but a very humble one.

52:21.763 --> 52:23.526
Why did you ask me out here?

52:23.698 --> 52:26.189
I couldn't let you go home
while you were still angry.

52:26.367 --> 52:28.767
I'm sure you had excellent reasons
for what you said.

52:28.936 --> 52:30.130
Oh, believe me, I have.

52:30.304 --> 52:33.068
There are times when a man
might find it impossible to do...

52:33.241 --> 52:36.005
...even what his heart
prompts him to do.

52:36.177 --> 52:39.203
But I never could willingly
do anything to hurt you.

52:39.380 --> 52:41.974
How can I believe you
when I don't even understand you?

52:42.817 --> 52:45.911
Then will you believe this
without understanding?

52:46.154 --> 52:48.088
I love you.

52:51.092 --> 52:54.289
Oh, is it true?

52:54.595 --> 52:56.563
Or do you say that because you must?

52:56.731 --> 53:02.328
I love you more than truth
or life or honor.

53:14.716 --> 53:16.707
Tell me, Rudolf...

53:16.884 --> 53:19.819
...why is it that I love you now
with all my heart...

53:19.987 --> 53:23.286
...when I never even liked you before?
- Never before?

53:23.991 --> 53:27.688
It was at the coronation.
I looked at you and...

53:27.862 --> 53:30.092
And that was the first time
you loved me?

53:30.264 --> 53:32.926
You ask that as if you'd be pleased
to hear me say yes.

53:34.068 --> 53:36.161
Would "yes" be true?

53:36.571 --> 53:37.936
Yes.

53:45.379 --> 53:47.847
You seem so different.

53:48.015 --> 53:51.075
I wanted you to be different
from the Rudolf I knew...

53:51.252 --> 53:53.743
...from the Rudolf I didn't love.

53:54.489 --> 53:56.616
And you are. And you aren't.

53:58.025 --> 53:59.652
Flavia...

53:59.827 --> 54:04.730
...if I were different,
if I were not the king...?

54:04.899 --> 54:06.696
Why do you say that?

54:06.868 --> 54:10.429
Could you still love me
if I were not the king?

54:11.372 --> 54:16.503
In my heart there is no king, no crown.
Only you.

54:17.945 --> 54:22.780
Flavia, I am not...

54:22.950 --> 54:24.781
Your Majesty!

54:25.119 --> 54:26.746
A thousand pardons, Your Majesty.

54:26.921 --> 54:29.481
His Eminence the Cardinal
is waiting to take his leave.

54:30.758 --> 54:32.783
We must not keep His Eminence waiting.

54:34.529 --> 54:37.657
- Is anything wrong, Colonel Zapt?
- Nothing, Your Highness.

54:37.832 --> 54:41.859
It is always my unpleasant task
to be the reminder of duty.

54:42.036 --> 54:46.132
- Faithful Colonel Zapt.
- God bless Your Royal Highness.

54:46.307 --> 54:49.708
But above all, God save the king.

54:51.412 --> 54:53.744
God save the king.

55:14.168 --> 55:16.159
The romance progressed
very well tonight.

55:16.337 --> 55:18.464
You struck a good blow for the king.

55:18.639 --> 55:20.834
What's to prevent me
striking a blow for myself?

55:21.008 --> 55:23.602
Don't take it so. You're bound
in honor to play the king.

55:23.778 --> 55:25.746
For honor? Have you left me any honor?

55:25.913 --> 55:28.746
- Come, come.
- You forgot the human element, didn't you?

55:28.916 --> 55:31.407
I'm a man in love
with a woman who loves me.

55:31.586 --> 55:33.178
- You saw tonight. You heard!
- I did.

55:33.354 --> 55:36.152
Then why should I ever leave the throne?
Could you expose me?

55:36.324 --> 55:38.224
If you did,
you'd get Michael in my place.

55:38.392 --> 55:40.724
I could marry her
and send the king and Michael...

55:40.895 --> 55:43.455
- lf you did that, you'd have to kill me.
- What if I did?

55:43.631 --> 55:47.123
- I could raise all of Strelsau against you.
- You could, but you wouldn't.

55:47.301 --> 55:51.294
Then find the king. Find him!

55:53.341 --> 55:54.899
Before it's too late.

55:58.412 --> 56:00.471
Odd, a man not knowing
his own brother.

56:00.648 --> 56:03.048
But I assure you,
they're enough alike to be twins.

56:03.718 --> 56:07.085
You're trying to tell me
the man I saw crowned is an impostor?

56:07.255 --> 56:09.485
Not your type of fiction, I see.
Too incredible.

56:09.657 --> 56:13.718
But still, these things do happen.
I knew twin sisters once who...

56:13.895 --> 56:15.920
But that's another story.

56:16.364 --> 56:20.061
I see Your Highness isn't interested.
Shall I go to market elsewhere?

56:20.234 --> 56:23.795
If what you say is true, why hasn't
the king been heard from? Where is he?

56:23.971 --> 56:25.962
He's in a woodcutter's cabin.

56:26.140 --> 56:29.667
Oh, by the way, royal blood is not blue
as most people think. It's red.

56:29.844 --> 56:33.075
- I know because I had to spill a little.
- You've abducted him.

56:33.247 --> 56:35.545
It's an old medieval custom,
abducting kings.

56:35.716 --> 56:39.584
Only you could have carried out a coup
like that. What have you done with him?

56:39.754 --> 56:44.487
Well, there's one thing we haven't
discussed. In fact, it's the same old topic.

56:44.659 --> 56:46.718
In a cabin, you say?
But where, man? Where?

56:46.894 --> 56:50.625
Now, why do people abduct kings?
For fun, Your Highness?

56:50.798 --> 56:53.858
Surely there's always the little matter
of the king's ransom.

56:54.035 --> 56:57.129
You can be the first man in the kingdom,
after the king.

56:57.305 --> 56:59.432
- How much down on account?
- Ten thousand.

56:59.607 --> 57:02.269
That's a poor price for a king and a crown.

57:02.443 --> 57:03.933
- Twenty.
- Well, it's too cheap.

57:04.111 --> 57:08.343
But I will admit he's a bit of a nuisance,
always whining about being chained up.

57:08.516 --> 57:11.451
- How badly did you wound him?
- Not fatally, I'm afraid.

57:11.619 --> 57:16.886
But the cabin is very damp, Your Highness.
He could easily develop pneumonia.

57:17.391 --> 57:21.555
And let the Englishman reign
for the rest of his life?

57:21.729 --> 57:25.665
- Could we ever expose him?
- That hadn't occurred to me.

57:26.701 --> 57:31.502
But if the Englishman died first and
was buried in the cathedral as the king...

57:31.672 --> 57:35.574
There are moments in your presence
when I feel myself an amateur.

57:35.743 --> 57:37.938
This fraud is an insult
to the whole country.

57:38.112 --> 57:40.444
Your Highness shows me
the path of duty.

57:40.614 --> 57:44.141
It is the simple duty of a patriot
to kill him like a dog.

57:47.822 --> 57:51.258
There are times, Rupert,
when we need the ladies.

57:51.425 --> 57:53.893
Even in matters of state.

57:55.062 --> 57:57.792
I'm about to ask a great service
of you and Antoinette.

58:01.469 --> 58:03.733
Rudolf Rassendyll?

58:04.972 --> 58:07.998
It couldn't be a bill from my tailor,
I suppose.

58:14.382 --> 58:18.284
"If Mr. Rassendyll desires to know
the whereabouts of the king...

58:18.452 --> 58:21.387
...let him come tonight at 2:00
to the deserted summerhouse...

58:21.555 --> 58:25.514
...behind the wall on Boulevard Elphberg.
He must be alone.

58:25.693 --> 58:29.060
If he neglects this invitation,
he may harm the Princess Flavia."

58:29.230 --> 58:32.688
Oh, obviously a trick of Michael's.
They must take you for a fool.

58:32.867 --> 58:34.494
Wait a minute. There's a bit more.

58:34.668 --> 58:37.762
"If you hesitate,
consult Captain von Tarlenheim."

58:39.340 --> 58:41.706
They must take me
for an even bigger fool.

58:43.210 --> 58:44.905
"Ask him what woman would do most...

58:45.079 --> 58:47.741
...to prevent Michael
from marrying the Princess Flavia...

58:47.915 --> 58:50.713
...and therefore most to prevent
his becoming king.

58:50.885 --> 58:53.217
And ask if her name begins with A."

58:54.355 --> 58:57.847
A? Antoinette de Mauban.

58:58.025 --> 59:01.859
A French woman madly in love
with Michael. Of course!

59:02.029 --> 59:04.896
- She'll lose him if...
- Where is the Boulevard Elphberg?

59:05.066 --> 59:07.398
- Are you going?
- I am.

59:07.568 --> 59:11.868
- Not without me.
- Good man. But no Colonel Zapt.

59:12.039 --> 59:15.770
He'd have 14 different reasons why
we shouldn't go, all of them good ones.

59:15.943 --> 59:18.639
Well, if the colonel
can't get news of the king...

59:18.813 --> 59:20.781
...we'll get it for him.

01:00:48.002 --> 01:00:51.563
You know this is a trap, don't you?
Three men are coming here to kill you.

01:00:51.739 --> 01:00:52.797
Where's the king?

01:00:52.973 --> 01:00:55.771
Before I tell you, I must have your word.
No harm to Michael.

01:00:56.577 --> 01:01:00.035
Why do you betray him in one breath
and plead for his life in the next?

01:01:00.214 --> 01:01:01.476
Think what you like.

01:01:01.649 --> 01:01:05.278
Think that I just don't like murder.
Think that I'm just a jealous woman.

01:01:05.452 --> 01:01:07.215
- Have I your word?
- Yes.

01:01:07.388 --> 01:01:10.380
As much as I can give it,
if you tell the truth.

01:01:11.492 --> 01:01:15.189
They're moving the king tonight, from
the forest to Michael's castle near Zenda.

01:01:15.496 --> 01:01:17.327
- That's what I wanted to know.
- Wait.

01:01:17.498 --> 01:01:21.935
If the castle is attacked, the king will be
killed. No trace of his body will be found.

01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:24.695
Charming character, your friend Michael.

01:01:24.872 --> 01:01:27.807
- Do you want my help or don't you?
- Yes.

01:01:29.276 --> 01:01:32.040
- How do we rescue the king?
- Leave that to me.

01:01:32.213 --> 01:01:35.740
You must have his friends at hand
at his hunting lodge on some excuse...

01:01:35.916 --> 01:01:37.816
...boar hunting perhaps.

01:01:37.985 --> 01:01:40.749
As soon as I can arrange an escape,
I'll get word to you.

01:01:40.921 --> 01:01:44.049
How will I know
it isn't another trap of Michael's?

01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:48.790
The man I send you
will have the mate to this.

01:01:49.496 --> 01:01:51.521
Now go, and go quickly.

01:01:51.865 --> 01:01:54.095
- And you?
- If Michael finds out what I've done...

01:01:54.268 --> 01:01:56.361
...you and I will not meet again.

01:01:57.972 --> 01:02:00.406
Good luck in everything.

01:02:00.808 --> 01:02:03.140
And to you with the princess.

01:02:03.544 --> 01:02:05.205
They've come. They're too soon.

01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:08.941
Mr. Rassendyll.

01:02:11.852 --> 01:02:15.549
Mr. Rassendyll, forgive me if I interrupt you
at an inopportune moment...

01:02:15.723 --> 01:02:17.714
...but I'd like a friendly word
with you.

01:02:17.891 --> 01:02:19.722
I'm alone and unarmed.

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:21.985
It's Rupert of Hentzau. Don't trust him.

01:02:22.162 --> 01:02:24.892
We can talk with the door between us,
Count Hentzau.

01:02:25.065 --> 01:02:27.533
Will you give me your word
not to fire while we talk?

01:02:27.701 --> 01:02:29.760
I give you my word not to fire
before you do.

01:02:29.937 --> 01:02:31.928
Say what you have to say
from where you are.

01:02:32.139 --> 01:02:35.734
As you please.
A truce, while I offer peace terms.

01:02:35.909 --> 01:02:38.901
Fifty thousand pounds
and safe conduct to the frontier.

01:02:40.648 --> 01:02:44.175
- Well, that sounds fair enough.
- Well, do you accept?

01:02:44.351 --> 01:02:47.252
Give me a moment to think it over.
Get out of the line of fire.

01:02:47.421 --> 01:02:48.649
Yes.

01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:55.920
- Count Hentzau?
- Your Majesty.

01:02:57.231 --> 01:02:59.495
I hold you to your word
and accept your offer.

01:02:59.667 --> 01:03:01.157
Congratulations.

01:03:01.335 --> 01:03:05.533
The money's in my pocket and there's a
good horse waiting for you. Come out.

01:03:06.307 --> 01:03:09.037
I'd prefer you to come in.
It's less public.

01:03:09.209 --> 01:03:10.699
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.

01:03:10.878 --> 01:03:12.607
Careful, he'll shoot first.

01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:16.409
What, after he's given his word?
In England that simply isn't done.

01:03:16.583 --> 01:03:17.982
Open it.

01:03:18.352 --> 01:03:20.411
What, when there are
three against one?

01:03:20.587 --> 01:03:22.782
All right, I'll open it myself.

01:03:59.026 --> 01:04:00.493
Fritz!

01:04:17.010 --> 01:04:21.242
I regret that we have failed to keep Your
Majesty sufficiently amused in Strelsau.

01:04:21.415 --> 01:04:25.784
I would've suggested a much more
varied program than just riding with me...

01:04:25.953 --> 01:04:28.478
...only I was foolish enough
to believe that...

01:04:28.655 --> 01:04:30.418
To believe what?

01:04:30.958 --> 01:04:34.860
To believe you were serious when you told
me you preferred my company to the courts.

01:04:35.028 --> 01:04:38.657
I should have known better.
But I'm sure after an exciting boar hunt...

01:04:38.832 --> 01:04:40.766
...you will be your old self again.

01:04:40.934 --> 01:04:44.461
- Are you angry with me?
- Oh, and what right have I to be angry?

01:04:45.205 --> 01:04:48.663
Last night you made me feel
that every hour away from me was wasted.

01:04:48.842 --> 01:04:52.369
But boar hunting,
that's quite a different matter.

01:04:52.546 --> 01:04:53.877
Do you think I want to go?

01:04:54.047 --> 01:04:56.572
Of course you don't.
Your first duty is to the boars.

01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:59.913
They would never forgive you
if you didn't hunt them and kill them.

01:05:00.287 --> 01:05:04.280
Perhaps the boars will hunt me.
They might even kill me.

01:05:05.125 --> 01:05:07.650
Doesn't the thought of my danger
touch you?

01:05:07.828 --> 01:05:11.821
- Or do you weep for my danger?
- Oh, this is like you used to be...

01:05:11.999 --> 01:05:15.765
...but not like the king I've come to love.
- Oh, my darling...

01:05:15.936 --> 01:05:19.599
...do you really think that
I would leave you to go hunting?

01:05:19.773 --> 01:05:22.571
- Then you're not going?
- I'm not going hunting.

01:05:22.743 --> 01:05:24.768
That is, not just for boar.

01:05:25.179 --> 01:05:27.044
Then what?

01:05:28.115 --> 01:05:31.516
- Rudolf, it's Michael.
- Indirectly.

01:05:31.685 --> 01:05:33.778
- Oh, darling, you mustn't go.
- My sweet.

01:05:33.954 --> 01:05:37.390
Shall I tell them I can't go because
we have an engagement to go riding?

01:05:37.558 --> 01:05:41.221
- I won't let you go. Send someone else.
- What kind of a king would do that?

01:05:41.395 --> 01:05:45.195
- But I don't understand why...
- And I can't tell you now.

01:05:45.365 --> 01:05:49.802
But I will tell you the moment I can.
You believe that, don't you?

01:05:51.872 --> 01:05:53.863
Yes, of course I do.

01:05:54.041 --> 01:05:56.009
Forgive me, Rudolf, I...

01:05:56.176 --> 01:05:59.202
I've behaved like a spoiled child.

01:05:59.613 --> 01:06:02.548
You see, I've never been in love before.

01:06:02.749 --> 01:06:04.808
Oh, my darling.

01:06:15.762 --> 01:06:18.526
I really must go.

01:06:23.403 --> 01:06:25.564
Stay here. Let me go alone.

01:06:25.739 --> 01:06:27.639
No, don't turn.

01:06:27.808 --> 01:06:31.938
If I see your eyes,
I might forget to be a king.

01:06:36.183 --> 01:06:38.174
Rudolf, come back to me soon.

01:06:38.819 --> 01:06:41.947
Shan't a man come back
to the loveliest woman in all the world?

01:06:42.122 --> 01:06:45.182
A thousand Michaels
couldn't keep me from you.

01:06:45.659 --> 01:06:50.096
But if I shouldn't, you'd never forget me?

01:06:50.330 --> 01:06:51.729
Never.

01:06:51.899 --> 01:06:54.959
You'd be a brave queen
and do your part?

01:06:55.602 --> 01:06:58.730
Though my life be empty
and my heart dead.

01:06:59.573 --> 01:07:01.803
You would do your part.

01:07:05.512 --> 01:07:07.241
Rudolf!

01:07:22.896 --> 01:07:26.457
Put away those popguns
and take me to the king.

01:07:29.570 --> 01:07:31.697
The man's got courage,
you must grant him that.

01:07:31.872 --> 01:07:34.170
I'll grant him six feet of earth
when the time comes.

01:07:34.341 --> 01:07:35.706
- No time like the present.
- No.

01:07:35.876 --> 01:07:39.073
Your Majesty, Count Hentzau,
with a message from the Duke of Strelsau.

01:07:39.246 --> 01:07:42.306
- Tell him His Majesty is indisposed.
- No, wait a minute.

01:07:42.482 --> 01:07:45.212
Let's hear what he has to say.
Send him in.

01:07:45.385 --> 01:07:46.613
Disarm him first.

01:07:54.595 --> 01:07:57.223
- The play-actor in person.
- Hentzau!

01:07:57.397 --> 01:08:01.493
Your Majesty, I bring you
your brother's humble greetings...

01:08:01.668 --> 01:08:04.967
...and his hopes that you will enjoy
the boar hunting here in Zenda.

01:08:05.138 --> 01:08:08.904
And his respects, of course,
to your two principal boars.

01:08:11.878 --> 01:08:16.372
Well, what price the crown today?
The last offer was 50,000 pounds.

01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:19.348
Do I hear perhaps 52,000?

01:08:19.519 --> 01:08:23.148
You'd hear a much better offer
than that. In private.

01:08:32.499 --> 01:08:33.898
Before we go any further...

01:08:34.067 --> 01:08:37.036
...I must tell you I'm prepared
to give you a chance to escape...

01:08:37.203 --> 01:08:39.604
...your thoroughly well-deserved end...

01:08:39.773 --> 01:08:44.801
...on the condition that you yourself
return the prisoner of Zenda to me alive.

01:08:44.978 --> 01:08:47.537
Mr. Rassendyll, do you
seriously expect me to believe...

01:08:47.714 --> 01:08:50.649
...that you of all people
want the king back?

01:08:50.817 --> 01:08:53.786
- You insult my intelligence.
- I see.

01:08:53.953 --> 01:08:56.286
Then you've come
a very long way for nothing.

01:08:56.456 --> 01:08:58.321
I hope not, for Michael's sake.

01:08:58.492 --> 01:09:01.620
Oh, you've brought another
of his generous ultimatums.

01:09:02.029 --> 01:09:04.054
I have. He doubles his offer.

01:09:04.231 --> 01:09:06.893
A hundred thousand pounds.

01:09:11.203 --> 01:09:12.671
I thought it would amuse you.

01:09:12.839 --> 01:09:16.240
The fact is, between ourselves,
Michael doesn't understand a gentleman.

01:09:16.410 --> 01:09:17.809
You and I, we do, don't we?

01:09:17.978 --> 01:09:20.947
Rassendyll, you're a man
after my own heart.

01:09:21.113 --> 01:09:25.140
You and I are the only two people worth
saving in this whole affair. Aren't we?

01:09:25.952 --> 01:09:28.750
This is my plan for us. Now, listen.

01:09:28.921 --> 01:09:32.015
Attack the castle boldly. Let your...

01:09:32.192 --> 01:09:35.491
...friends ride at the head.
There's bound to be a little rifle play.

01:09:35.662 --> 01:09:37.993
- Oh, unavoidable.
- Arrange the time with me...

01:09:38.165 --> 01:09:40.395
I have such confidence in you, of course.

01:09:40.567 --> 01:09:41.863
Michael will fall.

01:09:42.035 --> 01:09:45.368
The king will already have moved on
to a happier life in the next world.

01:09:45.538 --> 01:09:47.904
And your friends, if they fall too,
you and I...

01:09:48.075 --> 01:09:50.100
...Rupert of Hentzau
and king of the realm...

01:09:50.277 --> 01:09:52.768
...will be the only two left
who know the truth.

01:09:56.450 --> 01:10:00.352
Don't you think we're being
perhaps just a little drastic with Michael?

01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:02.383
Perhaps a little. But...

01:10:02.556 --> 01:10:05.525
...I make it a point never to
trust a jealous man, don't you?

01:10:05.692 --> 01:10:08.422
- Michael jealous?
- You know the lady, I think.

01:10:10.330 --> 01:10:13.891
Oh, in the summerhouse. Yes.

01:10:14.067 --> 01:10:17.594
But surely no woman in her right senses
would prefer the duke to you.

01:10:18.004 --> 01:10:21.098
Women are never in their right senses,
thank goodness.

01:10:21.441 --> 01:10:24.808
So you're doing all this for love.
How romantic.

01:10:25.212 --> 01:10:27.146
Well, love...

01:10:27.314 --> 01:10:31.444
...and Your Majesty's gratitude
throughout your long and happy reign.

01:10:31.618 --> 01:10:35.281
Then, of course, you might turn over
to me Michael's castles and estates.

01:10:35.455 --> 01:10:38.151
Oh, yes, of course,
we mustn't lose sight of those.

01:10:38.325 --> 01:10:40.691
You never know
whose hands they might fall into.

01:10:40.861 --> 01:10:43.261
Look what I offer you:
The throne and the princess.

01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:46.092
You were planning on them anyway,
but this way it's sure.

01:10:46.266 --> 01:10:48.257
Shall we shake hands on it?

01:10:56.076 --> 01:10:58.442
Hey, Zapt, Fritz, listen to this.

01:10:58.612 --> 01:11:00.637
Count Hentzau offers me the throne.

01:11:00.814 --> 01:11:03.180
That is, if you two don't mind
being killed.

01:11:03.450 --> 01:11:06.681
Their turn comes later, play-actor.
Yours comes now!

01:11:07.954 --> 01:11:10.149
Guards, stop that man!

01:11:47.794 --> 01:11:50.285
Play the queen, you blockhead.

01:12:01.374 --> 01:12:03.535
Florence Nightingale!

01:12:04.778 --> 01:12:06.575
<i>O Woman! In our hours of ease</i>

01:12:06.746 --> 01:12:09.613
<i>Uncertain, coy, and hard to please</i>

01:12:09.783 --> 01:12:15.119
<i>When pain and anguish ring the brow,</i>
<i>A ministering angel thou!</i>

01:12:25.465 --> 01:12:27.933
Could I have some water?

01:12:28.101 --> 01:12:31.127
You'll find plenty of water
down here, sire.

01:12:38.378 --> 01:12:41.575
So even a king can be curious, I see.

01:12:45.452 --> 01:12:48.478
Now, Jacob's ladder went
up into the sky, didn't it?

01:12:48.655 --> 01:12:53.149
Well, this goes down into the moat,
but it serves the same purpose.

01:12:53.326 --> 01:12:56.762
If this castle is attacked, there're
always two of us in the guardroom...

01:12:56.930 --> 01:13:00.058
...just up those steps,
ready to shove you down Jacob's ladder.

01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:02.866
Properly weighted, of course.

01:13:04.905 --> 01:13:07.738
I'd like to be left alone...

01:13:08.008 --> 01:13:10.738
...if your orders permit.

01:13:11.044 --> 01:13:12.875
The audience is ended, Your Majesty?

01:13:13.179 --> 01:13:17.343
Very well, sire. Try to get some sleep.

01:13:18.051 --> 01:13:20.485
And may you dream of Jacob's ladder...

01:13:20.654 --> 01:13:23.748
...with paradise at the end of it.

01:13:34.234 --> 01:13:37.795
Oh, I've just done my best
to make His Majesty more...

01:13:37.971 --> 01:13:40.371
...receptive.
- All right.

01:13:48.782 --> 01:13:50.579
Your Majesty.

01:13:50.917 --> 01:13:53.078
What do you expect to gain by this...

01:13:53.253 --> 01:13:55.881
...except death?

01:13:56.056 --> 01:13:58.889
Your admission that now,
your senses restored...

01:13:59.059 --> 01:14:02.460
...you have come to realize
the people would never accept a king...

01:14:02.629 --> 01:14:06.588
...with your, shall we say,
all too human failings.

01:14:07.133 --> 01:14:10.193
- What's that?
- Your abdication.

01:14:10.770 --> 01:14:14.206
As soon as you have signed this,
a comfortable bed is yours...

01:14:14.374 --> 01:14:17.775
...and the best of care until you're
strong enough to cross the frontier.

01:14:26.786 --> 01:14:31.280
I... I haven't lived like a king.

01:14:31.458 --> 01:14:34.621
But perhaps I can die like one...

01:14:34.794 --> 01:14:40.357
...and not disgrace the crown I never wore.

01:14:44.671 --> 01:14:47.697
A man here insists
he has a personal message for His Majesty.

01:14:47.874 --> 01:14:50.707
- Says he's one of the duke's men.
- Have you searched him?

01:14:50.910 --> 01:14:53.003
- Certainly, sir.
- Send him in.

01:14:53.179 --> 01:14:55.773
- If only this is from...
- Quiet!

01:15:01.554 --> 01:15:04.785
- What is it you want?
- I have a message for...

01:15:05.191 --> 01:15:09.252
I am to tell you that a troop of
the duke's hussars arrives tomorrow.

01:15:09.429 --> 01:15:13.024
If there is to be a rescue,
it must be tonight.

01:15:13.366 --> 01:15:15.027
You may count on me, sir.

01:15:15.201 --> 01:15:17.999
I am to lower the drawbridge
at two hours past midnight.

01:15:18.171 --> 01:15:21.436
But the noise. You say the king
will be killed at the first alarm?

01:15:21.608 --> 01:15:24.702
That is correct. Madame says
before the bridge can go down...

01:15:24.878 --> 01:15:28.109
...one of your men must swim the moat
and climb to her room.

01:15:28.281 --> 01:15:32.047
- And then?
- Alone, one man might reach the dungeon.

01:15:32.218 --> 01:15:34.778
That man alone
must hold off the guards from murder...

01:15:34.954 --> 01:15:37.787
...until the others can cross
the drawbridge and get below.

01:15:37.957 --> 01:15:40.482
Always two guards
on the prisoner, you say?

01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:44.323
- Two by day and two by night, sir.
- Any other men who can fight?

01:15:44.497 --> 01:15:47.432
Only His Highness
and Count Rupert tonight.

01:15:47.834 --> 01:15:49.995
Three against six.

01:15:51.304 --> 01:15:55.832
Well, tell madame that we'll be on
the shore at 2:00, waiting for her signal...

01:15:56.009 --> 01:15:57.533
...then I will swim the moat.

01:15:57.710 --> 01:16:00.406
The others will wait
until you lower the bridge.

01:16:02.482 --> 01:16:03.506
Good luck.

01:16:06.553 --> 01:16:09.784
But why three against six?
Surely we can take our men.

01:16:09.956 --> 01:16:13.414
- We don't dare if the secret's to be kept.
- No, the odds are too great.

01:16:13.593 --> 01:16:16.528
We must have help at hand if we need it.
Tell them to come.

01:16:16.696 --> 01:16:19.859
Well, I think I should be
the one to swim that moat.

01:16:20.033 --> 01:16:23.628
Right, lad.
We can't afford to lose both our kings.

01:16:23.803 --> 01:16:26.499
You'll lose one king tonight,
whatever takes place.

01:16:26.673 --> 01:16:30.131
If anything should happen to him
and not me, your game's up anyway.

01:16:30.543 --> 01:16:33.944
I've been an impostor for your sake,
I'll not be one for my own.

01:16:34.114 --> 01:16:36.514
No, Fritz, I swim that moat.

01:16:36.783 --> 01:16:40.048
If we do lose you both,
what's to become of us who are left?

01:16:42.522 --> 01:16:45.047
They'll serve Queen Flavia.

01:16:45.225 --> 01:16:48.319
I would to God I could be one of them.

01:19:05.898 --> 01:19:08.662
Go now. Give Mr. Rassendyll
time to hide in the passage.

01:19:08.835 --> 01:19:10.700
Open the doors
and let down the bridge.

01:19:10.870 --> 01:19:12.667
I hope I can work
the mechanism, madame.

01:19:12.839 --> 01:19:14.830
I certainly hope you can.

01:19:16.843 --> 01:19:20.802
The duke has retired for the night.
Hentzau is in charge of the guards.

01:19:20.980 --> 01:19:22.845
I was hoping I'd meet that fellow again.

01:19:23.016 --> 01:19:25.143
The crash of the bridge
will arouse the castle.

01:19:25.318 --> 01:19:29.049
The guards'll follow the orders and kill
the king before your men can get to him.

01:19:29.222 --> 01:19:31.622
- Unless...
- Unless I can handle the two of them...

01:19:31.791 --> 01:19:35.693
...until my men get down to me? That's it?
- Exactly.

01:19:35.862 --> 01:19:38.057
You see, I've trusted you, your word.

01:19:38.231 --> 01:19:40.825
- No harm to Michael.
- We're all agreed.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.797
It means exile, I'm afraid...

01:19:42.969 --> 01:19:46.200
...but that's what you wanted, isn't it?
- Yes.

01:19:50.343 --> 01:19:52.641
Down the steps
is the passage to the guardroom.

01:19:52.812 --> 01:19:57.044
Across the guardroom is the door
to the dungeon and the king.

01:20:55.007 --> 01:20:58.636
- What was that?
- It must've been somebody shutting a door.

01:20:58.811 --> 01:21:00.938
Probably madame's.

01:21:18.965 --> 01:21:23.061
- What's wrong? You're 10 minutes early.
- Duke's as nervous as a cat on hot bricks.

01:21:23.236 --> 01:21:25.067
What's he afraid of, burglars?

01:21:25.505 --> 01:21:28.804
- Is it true that he sent for more men?
- Yes, a whole garrison.

01:21:28.975 --> 01:21:31.443
Let's hope he gives us
an eight-hour watch after this.

01:21:31.611 --> 01:21:35.012
- Twelve hours is too long on guard.
- Keeps you out of mischief.

01:21:35.181 --> 01:21:39.515
You run in and out as you like.
We've got to stay in that dirty hole.

01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:44.315
I'm gonna make the rounds of
the doors and bridge before I turn in.

01:22:02.675 --> 01:22:05.303
It was very careless of you
to leave your door ajar.

01:22:05.478 --> 01:22:06.740
Very careless...

01:22:07.213 --> 01:22:11.377
...and very inviting.
- Yes.

01:22:11.651 --> 01:22:15.781
Come now, admit I've been patient.
And patience is a virtue I generally lack.

01:22:16.022 --> 01:22:18.752
You never lack audacity, Rupert.

01:22:18.925 --> 01:22:21.257
Had it occurred to you
I might not be alone?

01:22:21.561 --> 01:22:24.689
I always accept the risks.
I'm prepared for them.

01:22:29.702 --> 01:22:31.169
You...

01:22:31.337 --> 01:22:33.305
You really shouldn't be here, you know.

01:22:33.606 --> 01:22:35.437
Of course...

01:22:36.275 --> 01:22:37.936
...I shouldn't.

01:23:29.462 --> 01:23:33.398
Always inopportune, Michael,
but always in time.

01:23:38.905 --> 01:23:42.204
The moat can hold more than a king.

01:23:42.375 --> 01:23:46.778
Not without making a splash that
would be heard all over the kingdom.

01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:52.783
Michael!

01:23:57.723 --> 01:24:01.318
Michael? Michael.

01:24:01.494 --> 01:24:05.726
I would never have betrayed you.
I did it only to save you, my darling.

01:24:12.171 --> 01:24:14.139
Michael.

01:24:44.070 --> 01:24:47.096
De Gautet, Lauengram, rouse the castle!

01:24:49.075 --> 01:24:51.600
De Gautet! Lauengram!

01:24:53.412 --> 01:24:55.107
The drawbridge!

01:24:58.250 --> 01:25:02.710
I caught a servant trying to lower the bridge.
Must've been bribed. Go outside, guard it.

01:25:10.463 --> 01:25:13.091
You better be quiet and get some sleep.

01:25:37.256 --> 01:25:38.450
Kill the prisoner!

01:26:15.828 --> 01:26:17.557
I'll help you.

01:26:23.102 --> 01:26:24.899
Cousin Rudolf.

01:26:34.647 --> 01:26:37.411
- It's all right, Your Majesty. You're safe.
- Cousin Rudolf.

01:26:41.387 --> 01:26:43.617
Mr. Rassendyll.

01:26:52.932 --> 01:26:54.900
Thought you were more at home
with a knife.

01:26:55.067 --> 01:26:57.661
My knife turned out to be
more at home in Michael.

01:26:57.837 --> 01:27:01.773
We got in each other's way once too often,
just as you and I have.

01:27:01.941 --> 01:27:03.875
May I trouble you for those keys?

01:27:07.246 --> 01:27:08.406
Thank you.

01:27:09.448 --> 01:27:11.006
You've settled Krafstein, I see.

01:27:11.183 --> 01:27:13.549
Bersonin too, I presume?

01:27:13.719 --> 01:27:16.711
I almost hate to see you join them
with only a bullet in you.

01:27:16.889 --> 01:27:18.447
Wait a minute.

01:27:19.058 --> 01:27:22.653
How do you know it's Bersonin I threw
into the moat, and not the king?

01:27:24.463 --> 01:27:28.297
Oh, no. You've worn the queen's uniform
and the old school tie.

01:27:28.467 --> 01:27:32.426
- You'd never use my methods.
- Oh, I don't know.

01:27:32.805 --> 01:27:35.433
Faced with death, I might.

01:27:36.509 --> 01:27:39.307
May I have a last cigarette
while we review the situation?

01:27:52.725 --> 01:27:53.953
Half my kingdom!

01:27:57.696 --> 01:27:58.754
For a match.

01:28:05.638 --> 01:28:10.200
You've got your eye on Michael's castle
and estates, or at least so you tell me.

01:28:10.576 --> 01:28:13.272
Yes. You found it very amusing
I remember.

01:28:14.313 --> 01:28:16.474
I'm scarcely in the position
to laugh at it now.

01:28:16.749 --> 01:28:20.879
Oh, I don't know.
At least this time you'll die laughing.

01:28:23.689 --> 01:28:24.883
Thank you.

01:28:40.773 --> 01:28:42.832
I can't get used to fighting
with furniture.

01:28:43.008 --> 01:28:46.205
- Where did you learn it?
- On the playing fields of Eton.

01:28:46.579 --> 01:28:48.706
I see how much I missed
by not going to Eton.

01:28:48.881 --> 01:28:51.441
Nevertheless, you did them
one great service.

01:28:51.984 --> 01:28:53.246
Yes? What was that?

01:28:53.419 --> 01:28:54.977
You didn't go to Eton.

01:29:03.062 --> 01:29:06.225
All right, this will be
your last fencing lesson.

01:29:06.465 --> 01:29:08.092
Look out for your head.

01:29:15.975 --> 01:29:17.738
Why not stand your ground
and fight?

01:29:19.278 --> 01:29:21.212
"He who fights
and runs away," remember?

01:29:38.597 --> 01:29:41.361
You wanna get to the bridge.
I killed a man for trying that.

01:29:41.533 --> 01:29:43.592
- An unarmed man, of course.
- Of course.

01:33:13.345 --> 01:33:16.576
It's beginning to sound
too much like the playing fields of Eton.

01:33:18.083 --> 01:33:20.677
I'll return to fight another day too.

01:33:23.155 --> 01:33:25.282
Goodbye, play-actor!

01:33:36.768 --> 01:33:38.668
All right, stand by in the courtyard!

01:33:39.371 --> 01:33:40.531
The king?

01:33:41.807 --> 01:33:43.638
The king lives.

01:33:50.315 --> 01:33:55.082
Do you know, it seems a hundred years...

01:33:55.254 --> 01:33:58.018
...since I struck you in the face.

01:33:59.591 --> 01:34:01.582
Please forgive me...

01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:05.924
...and be my guide,
as you were my father's.

01:34:09.334 --> 01:34:12.667
Thank you, Your Majesty.

01:34:14.039 --> 01:34:18.874
And now, we mustn't keep him waiting.

01:34:44.836 --> 01:34:47.964
I've tried to wear it with honor,
Your Majesty.

01:34:51.343 --> 01:34:55.336
I can't talk very much yet.

01:34:57.883 --> 01:35:02.582
You're my best and nearest friend,
Cousin Rudolf.

01:35:03.121 --> 01:35:05.988
I... I wanted to keep you with me.

01:35:06.158 --> 01:35:09.059
To tell everybody what you'd done.

01:35:09.228 --> 01:35:12.720
But Zapt says the secret must be kept.

01:35:13.131 --> 01:35:16.225
He's right, Your Majesty.
My work here is done.

01:35:16.835 --> 01:35:18.666
Yes, it's done.

01:35:18.837 --> 01:35:21.397
As no one but you could have done it.

01:35:23.342 --> 01:35:26.539
I... I don't know
when I shall see you again.

01:35:27.846 --> 01:35:32.783
- If ever I can serve you, Your Majesty...
- You could never serve me better, cousin.

01:35:33.185 --> 01:35:35.210
You've taught me how to be a king.

01:36:00.545 --> 01:36:02.479
Is she here?

01:36:11.456 --> 01:36:14.857
- Does she know everything?
- Everything.

01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:18.927
- What did she say?
- Nothing.

01:36:19.965 --> 01:36:22.195
She wants to see you.

01:36:42.454 --> 01:36:44.217
Your Highness.

01:36:46.858 --> 01:36:49.486
I sent for you to thank you...

01:36:50.228 --> 01:36:55.063
...for the service you have done
this kingdom and its king.

01:36:57.169 --> 01:37:00.536
No one can know better than myself...

01:37:00.706 --> 01:37:04.039
...how conscientiously
you have played your role.

01:37:06.778 --> 01:37:11.511
I love you. With my whole
heart and soul, I love you.

01:37:11.683 --> 01:37:14.550
In all else I've been an impostor,
but not in that.

01:37:15.387 --> 01:37:17.753
From the first moment I saw you
in the cathedral...

01:37:17.923 --> 01:37:20.483
...I knew you were the only woman
in the world for me.

01:37:20.659 --> 01:37:25.221
As I stand here now, I know
there never can be any other.

01:37:26.198 --> 01:37:29.292
It would have made no difference
if I'd known.

01:37:29.801 --> 01:37:34.363
It was always you, never the king.

01:37:37.075 --> 01:37:39.839
Is it true that you're
going home to England?

01:37:41.613 --> 01:37:43.012
Tonight.

01:37:47.953 --> 01:37:49.079
Come with me.

01:37:49.254 --> 01:37:51.586
I won't let them stand in the way
of our happiness!

01:37:51.757 --> 01:37:53.588
- If only I could...
- Oh, my darling.

01:37:53.759 --> 01:37:56.125
There's a world outside. Our world.

01:37:56.294 --> 01:37:59.092
Think, you'll be free.
Free of these cares and duties...

01:37:59.264 --> 01:38:01.630
...free to live as joyously and ha...

01:38:02.868 --> 01:38:04.733
What is it, Flavia?

01:38:04.903 --> 01:38:08.600
I was born to these cares
and duties, Rudolf.

01:38:09.141 --> 01:38:13.976
Help me to do what I was born to.
Help me to do what I must.

01:38:14.146 --> 01:38:15.977
How can I, my darling? I love you.

01:38:16.815 --> 01:38:19.283
But is love the only thing?

01:38:19.584 --> 01:38:23.748
If love were all, I could follow you in rags
to the end of the world.

01:38:24.222 --> 01:38:28.488
But if love were all, you would have
left the king to die in his cell.

01:38:29.161 --> 01:38:31.925
Honor binds a woman too, Rudolf.

01:38:32.097 --> 01:38:34.588
And my honor lies...

01:38:34.766 --> 01:38:38.167
...in keeping faith
with my country and my house.

01:38:38.837 --> 01:38:42.000
I don't know why God
has let me love you.

01:38:42.507 --> 01:38:44.805
But I... I know that I must stay.

01:38:48.914 --> 01:38:51.041
Never to see you again.

01:38:51.983 --> 01:38:54.110
Never to hold you.

01:38:54.519 --> 01:38:55.611
Never...

01:38:57.556 --> 01:38:59.251
My darling.

01:39:00.392 --> 01:39:03.259
Your heart will always be in my heart...

01:39:03.428 --> 01:39:06.192
...and the touch of your lips
on mine.

01:39:31.223 --> 01:39:32.588
We'll meet again, Fritz.

01:39:32.757 --> 01:39:34.884
Fate doesn't always make
the right men kings.

01:39:36.461 --> 01:39:38.986
Goodbye, colonel.
We've run a good course together.

01:39:39.297 --> 01:39:43.597
Goodbye, Englishman.
You're the finest Elphberg of them all.

01:40:17.168 --> 01:40:19.159
