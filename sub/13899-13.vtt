00:04.960 --> 00:06.000
It'll be good for him.

00:06.040 --> 00:07.040
[Des] Jake are you sure

00:07.090 --> 00:07.840
you don't mind me living
with you?

00:08.460 --> 00:09.380
Of course I mind.

00:09.420 --> 00:10.340
Jake!

00:10.380 --> 00:11.260
I'm joking. I'm not joking.

00:11.300 --> 00:12.680
Really?

00:12.720 --> 00:14.890
Yes Des it's be fine, okay?
I don't want it to be

00:14.930 --> 00:17.050
a permanent thing.
But it's fine.

00:17.100 --> 00:18.350
This is all your
fault.

00:18.390 --> 00:19.470
Cool. And you know, obviously,

00:19.520 --> 00:21.060
I'm
not gonna stay here that long.

00:21.100 --> 00:23.230
It's not like it'll be forever.
I mean, that would be weird.

00:23.270 --> 00:24.230
Des.

00:24.270 --> 00:25.480
Remember what we
talked about.

00:25.520 --> 00:26.980
- I know.
- You know what?

00:27.020 --> 00:30.650
I knows you’re not wicked for
letting me stay here.

00:30.690 --> 00:33.200
Smooth. You've gotta tell him.
Remember the plan?

00:33.240 --> 00:34.360
[Des] No, no, no, no.

00:34.410 --> 00:35.570
No. Des.

00:35.610 --> 00:38.240
Yes! He can't strangle
you over the phone.

00:38.950 --> 00:40.040
And I, um.

00:40.950 --> 00:42.830
I need to tell you something.

00:42.870 --> 00:43.750
What?

00:44.620 --> 00:45.290
I peed in the sink.

00:45.330 --> 00:46.710
What?

00:46.750 --> 00:48.710
It's not the right time.
And I didn't pee in the sink.

00:49.960 --> 00:51.090
He hung up.

00:51.130 --> 00:52.510
I can't believe you moved
him in with me.

00:52.550 --> 00:54.050
Why didn't he just
stay with you at the house?

00:54.090 --> 00:56.340
Where's the fun in that?
Besides, it'll do you good.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.430
Now, who's this mystery client
we're meeting?

00:58.470 --> 00:59.470
This isn't about
a woman, is it?

01:00.350 --> 01:02.980
No. No. Yes. She is a woman.

01:03.020 --> 01:04.600
But she's a client.

01:04.640 --> 01:06.060
She hired us. So...

01:06.100 --> 01:07.350
Whatever.
We gotta go meet her.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.310
And I suppose you gave her

01:08.360 --> 01:10.020
your usual discounted rate.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.480
I'm your son, OK?

01:11.530 --> 01:12.990
I can't believe that you'd
think that I'm that shallow.

01:13.700 --> 01:14.610
No I don't think it.

01:15.110 --> 01:16.200
I know it.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.330
[Mal] I'm starting to think
your client missus isn't here.

01:29.420 --> 01:30.630
[Jake] This is the
old Rec Centre.

01:30.670 --> 01:32.260
Didn't I learn how
to swim here?

01:33.050 --> 01:34.590
Been shut down for years.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.140
I'm getting a bad feeling
about this.

01:38.180 --> 01:40.010
Yeah. I think I know
what you mean.

01:42.430 --> 01:43.220
Inspector Smallwood?

01:43.890 --> 01:45.140
What's this about?

01:45.180 --> 01:46.020
What are you guys doing?

01:46.890 --> 01:48.230
How'd you know I'd be here?

01:48.270 --> 01:51.360
Buddy, what's on the go?
Are you okay?

01:51.400 --> 01:52.860
I should have known
you were involved.

01:52.900 --> 01:54.240
You were his partner.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.320
Are you high, or something?

01:55.360 --> 01:56.740
Who are you talking
about, Craig?

01:57.160 --> 01:58.030
[bang]

01:59.530 --> 02:01.490
Well, he'd be referring to me.

02:36.860 --> 02:38.070
I know who you are.

02:38.110 --> 02:39.990
I'm looking for Inspector
Craig Smallwood.

02:40.030 --> 02:41.450
We were scheduled to have
a meeting today.

02:42.280 --> 02:44.160
He's not in at the moment.

02:44.200 --> 02:45.160
Do you know where
I can reach him?

02:46.910 --> 02:47.870
Give us a sec?

02:49.830 --> 02:51.380
I've been trying to call
him for two days.

02:51.420 --> 02:53.210
Do you have any idea
where he is?

No.

Always a sucker for a damsel
in distress.

03:03.010 --> 03:05.310
Well you got me here.
Now what do you want?

03:05.350 --> 03:06.680
Well, I've been on the

03:06.720 --> 03:08.310
run for a long,
long time.

03:08.350 --> 03:09.190
And that's gonna
end right here.

03:09.230 --> 03:10.770
And you're gonna help me.

03:10.810 --> 03:13.690
I'm not sure how you knocking
a police inspector unconscious

03:13.730 --> 03:15.860
and kidnapping us is
gonna help you, but--

03:17.240 --> 03:18.150
Whatever.

03:18.190 --> 03:19.360
What do you want?

03:19.400 --> 03:21.530
Well, we're all gonna
work together--

03:21.570 --> 03:22.700
to prove my innocence.

03:22.740 --> 03:23.660
Sounds like fun.

03:23.700 --> 03:26.450
Yeah? Oh, yes.

03:26.490 --> 03:29.000
Yeah, you remember this
place, don't you partner?

03:29.040 --> 03:31.370
It's here where they said I
was supposed to have killed

03:31.420 --> 03:33.500
that hooker.
Lisa Younghusband.

03:34.210 --> 03:35.540
How could I forget?

03:35.590 --> 03:37.840
All those years ago?
Everyone thought I was guilty.

03:39.010 --> 03:40.550
[Smallwood] Maybe because
you skipped town

03:40.590 --> 03:41.970
before the trial.

03:42.010 --> 03:44.140
[Crocker] Well, you're
awake, inspector. You know,

03:44.180 --> 03:45.390
they made him an inspector

03:45.430 --> 03:47.180
after he framed me.
Isn't that--

03:47.220 --> 03:48.140
--crazy?

03:48.180 --> 03:49.520
Everyone believed
you were guilty.

03:49.560 --> 03:51.640
Well, the only problem with
that conclusion, is--

03:51.690 --> 03:53.650
it isn't substantiated by
a dead body,

03:53.690 --> 03:56.110
which, as far as I remember,
is kind of

03:56.150 --> 03:58.110
important to a
murder investigation.

03:58.150 --> 03:59.110
Keep talking.

03:59.530 --> 04:00.110
But you.

04:01.570 --> 04:05.620
You took care to make everything
look like I was guilty.

04:05.660 --> 04:07.700
Didn't you, inspector?

04:07.740 --> 04:08.990
What are you talking about?

04:09.040 --> 04:10.750
Why don't you tell Jake and
Malachy Doyle here

04:10.790 --> 04:12.330
just what I am talking about?

04:12.370 --> 04:14.290
Please, would you mind
doing that for me?

04:14.330 --> 04:15.250

04:19.500 --> 04:20.710
[Leslie] I'm at Smallwood's house.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.550
There's no sign of him.

04:22.590 --> 04:25.010
You know, it looks like he
hasn't been here for a while.

04:25.890 --> 04:27.260
No sign of him here either.

04:27.300 --> 04:28.220
I'll keep looking.

04:28.260 --> 04:29.470
I know a few places
he can be.

04:29.510 --> 04:31.220
If you hear anything,
you call me.

04:31.270 --> 04:32.310
It could be that he's just
on a bender.

04:33.520 --> 04:34.980
Since his divorce,
trust me, it happens.

04:36.150 --> 04:38.520
No, there's something,
it feels wrong.

04:39.230 --> 04:40.400
I'll call you later.

04:41.690 --> 04:42.740

04:46.030 --> 04:47.820
Did Smallwood have
a police cruiser?

04:47.870 --> 04:50.620
Yeah, he took out an unmarked
car a couple of days ago.

04:50.660 --> 04:52.540
Put a trace on it.
The GPS.

you know, me--

05:23.110 --> 05:25.360
moving in with Jake. I don't
wanna be a burden. to anyone--

05:25.950 --> 05:26.110
And him. So --

05:27.370 --> 05:30.280
I just wanna make sure
the place is clean.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.790
He will
appreciate that.

05:31.830 --> 05:32.790
Yeah. I think he will.

05:32.830 --> 05:34.870
Yes. But--
Could I ask that you

05:34.910 --> 05:37.040
vacuum later. When I'm not
trying to do paperwork.

05:37.080 --> 05:38.080

Duh, yeah. I can
totally do that.

05:39.880 --> 05:41.250
Thank you.
That's awesome.

05:46.180 --> 05:47.840
Sorry honey.
Did I upset you?

05:47.890 --> 05:49.300
No.

It's not you. No.

05:53.970 --> 05:55.480

felt like it would kill

05:59.940 --> 06:01.900

what would you do?

06:01.940 --> 06:04.360
You're afraid to tell Jake that
you and Tinny are a couple.

06:05.570 --> 06:07.200
How do you know?
Does everyone else know?

06:07.240 --> 06:09.280
Malachy told me. Yeah,
I think everybody knows.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.660
Jake?
Jake knows?

06:11.700 --> 06:12.870
That's why he wanted me
to move in here.

06:12.910 --> 06:14.120
He's gonna kill me when
I'm not looking!

06:14.160 --> 06:15.410
No. Jake doesn't know yet.

06:15.450 --> 06:17.330
Are you sure. Are you serious?
Are you sure?

06:17.370 --> 06:20.290
Yeah. I mean. When he finds
out he's gonna be totally

06:20.330 --> 06:20.880

But, you know what?
If you treat Tinny well,

of an odd request.

I need you to look into some
details around a murder.

When did it happen?

name was Lisa Younghusband.

woman that Kevin Crocker...

And don't let anyone know
you're doing it, if possible.

worried here?

No, no. Just let me know if
you find anything.

07:04.380 --> 07:05.380
Okay.

07:07.170 --> 07:08.090
We should be worried.

- Yeah.

You help me or...

time. This one

07:18.390 --> 07:19.890

Let me go.

07:21.060 --> 07:22.020
It's only a matter of
time before

07:22.060 --> 07:23.520
my people come
looking for me.

07:23.560 --> 07:24.860
[Jake] This is not
the way to go about

07:24.900 --> 07:26.900
proving to people that
you're not a crazy person.

07:26.940 --> 07:28.990
Yeah. There's my old partner.
Always had my back.

07:29.650 --> 07:30.610
Don't give me that.

07:30.650 --> 07:32.070
You pretty
much confessed the whole

07:32.110 --> 07:34.120
thing to me at the
time. Remember?

07:34.160 --> 07:38.160
No. Not really. Because at the
time, I had a whole lot of

07:38.200 --> 07:39.500
memory loss issues, Because
I had a lot of

07:39.540 --> 07:40.830
substance abuse issues.

07:40.870 --> 07:42.670
So... If I did confess...

07:42.710 --> 07:44.000
You did.

07:44.040 --> 07:47.460
Well maybe. Or maybe I was
just messing with you.

07:47.500 --> 07:48.710
Solid defense.

07:49.920 --> 07:51.760
Come on, Jake.
Look at this cop.

07:52.340 --> 07:53.390
Look deep into

07:53.430 --> 07:55.010
his rat faced eyes.

07:55.640 --> 07:57.140
You remember him.

07:57.180 --> 07:58.850
The Professional
Standards Bureau.

08:00.270 --> 08:01.520
You were in the Rat Squad.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.270
I knew I didn't like you
for a reason.

08:05.310 --> 08:08.230
[Crocker] And Mal, ask him
about the murder weapon.

08:08.730 --> 08:09.900
Go on.

08:09.940 --> 08:11.360
If you guys don't help
me get out of this,

08:11.400 --> 08:12.780
you're both going down with him.

08:12.820 --> 08:14.410
[Crocker]
Come on, Jake.

08:14.450 --> 08:15.910
You're one of the best
cops I ever worked with.

08:17.160 --> 08:18.490
Look at this man,
and tell me you trust him.

08:19.830 --> 08:23.080
Prove my innocence. And
save a scumbag's life.

08:24.210 --> 08:25.710
We all know what this
one has to lose.

08:27.170 --> 08:28.460
What about you two?

08:31.340 --> 08:32.840
[Judge Richardson] Rehab, Walter.

08:32.880 --> 08:37.010
He needs rehab, immediately.
And I'll lighten his sentence.

08:37.720 --> 08:38.850
Thank you My Lord.

08:38.890 --> 08:40.100
Working with you makes me regret

08:40.140 --> 08:40.730
regret going back
into private practice.

08:41.890 --> 08:44.060
You were a good Crown
Attorney, Walter.

08:44.100 --> 08:45.270
You still got a few good ones.

08:46.610 --> 08:48.570
And some great ones.

08:48.610 --> 08:50.030
[Lang]
Judge Richardson.

08:50.070 --> 08:51.360
Giving another one of Walter
McClean’s

08:51.400 --> 08:52.320
drugged out clients a break?

08:52.360 --> 08:53.280
I believe in

08:53.320 --> 08:55.200
second chances, Ms. Lang.

08:55.240 --> 08:56.570
[Walter]
You know.

08:56.620 --> 08:58.620
I was a Crown Attorney myself.

08:58.660 --> 09:00.580
I'd be happy to give you
a few pointers.

09:01.500 --> 09:02.710
Or not.

09:03.500 --> 09:04.500
[Des]
Mr. Honor.

09:05.330 --> 09:07.210
Can we speak for a moment?

09:07.250 --> 09:08.250
If this is about your case,

09:08.290 --> 09:10.000
please have your
counsel contact me.

09:10.040 --> 09:12.010
No, no. Nothing like
that. It's about an old case.

09:12.050 --> 09:13.670
Back when you were
a Crown Prosecutor.

09:13.720 --> 09:14.970
We're P.I.s.

09:15.010 --> 09:17.010
Investigators. Private.

09:17.050 --> 09:18.140
Okay.

09:18.180 --> 09:19.300
How can I help you?

09:19.350 --> 09:20.600
[Rose]
It's about a murder.

09:20.640 --> 09:24.390
From years ago.
Lisa Younghusband.

09:24.430 --> 09:25.890
How could I forget?

09:25.940 --> 09:27.520
She was a call girl, yes?

09:28.360 --> 09:30.360
Murdered by a corrupt cop.

09:30.400 --> 09:31.650
Yeah, see, that's the thing.

09:31.690 --> 09:32.990
He was never convicted.

09:33.030 --> 09:34.030
As I recall--

09:34.070 --> 09:36.200
He skipped town
before trial.

09:37.570 --> 09:39.410
I'm not sure how
I can help you.

09:39.450 --> 09:40.950
Why are we talking about this?

09:42.580 --> 09:46.080
Well, we've been hired
by someone.

09:46.120 --> 09:48.080
If there are grounds
for reopening

09:48.120 --> 09:51.340
this investigation. And it
could possibly shed new light

09:51.380 --> 09:52.880
on this case,
by all means.

09:53.880 --> 09:55.010
Call my assistant.
She'll give

09:55.050 --> 09:56.130
you access to the files.

09:56.180 --> 09:57.090
Thank you so much.

09:57.130 --> 10:00.300
You High-- Worship--ness.

10:01.350 --> 10:02.260
Good luck.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.270
Team Deadly.

10:05.140 --> 10:06.100
Ow.

10:14.110 --> 10:15.820
Add kidnapping
to the list, Malachy.

10:16.740 --> 10:17.150
Get me away from this lunatic.

10:18.700 --> 10:20.570
I'll see if I can get them
to go easy on you. Otherwise--

10:20.620 --> 10:22.160
Don't let him scare ya b'ys.

10:22.200 --> 10:23.620
The only one who is
gonna be facing

10:23.660 --> 10:25.750
Lady Justice when this is all
over is this one.

10:25.790 --> 10:26.910
'Cause you set me up.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.330
And now you're gonna pay.

10:28.370 --> 10:29.500
Just take it easy.

10:31.170 --> 10:31.880
Where are you taking us?

10:31.920 --> 10:33.210
[Crocker]
His house.

10:33.250 --> 10:35.050
I need the names of all the
other rats who were

10:35.090 --> 10:36.300
part of the frame up.

10:42.350 --> 10:43.640
There was a tip.

10:43.680 --> 10:45.020
I got a tip about
a murder weapon.

10:45.060 --> 10:45.930
[whack]

10:50.400 --> 10:50.900
[Jake] What is wrong with you?

10:51.940 --> 10:53.520
You just knocked
out our only lead.

10:53.560 --> 10:56.240
Oh come on. He's lying. He'd
say anything to get you two

10:56.280 --> 10:57.320
on his side.

10:57.780 --> 10:59.070
Uh, b'ys.

10:59.110 --> 11:00.030
What?

11:00.070 --> 11:00.450
What's that?

11:01.450 --> 11:01.700
[Mitchell]
Get out of the car.

11:03.330 --> 11:06.000
Unless you want this to be the
last thing that you ever see.

11:10.710 --> 11:11.580
[Leslie] Smallwood's
cruiser's out back.

11:12.710 --> 11:14.840
Why does this place
look so familiar?

11:14.880 --> 11:17.260
All I know is that there was
a murder here years ago.

11:17.300 --> 11:18.920
I remember reading about it.

11:18.970 --> 11:21.260
A hooker. Lisa something.

11:22.340 --> 11:24.140
The one that Kevin
Crocker killed.

11:24.180 --> 11:27.220
Crocker? Smallwood was
looking into Crocker.

11:27.270 --> 11:28.770
That can't be a coincidence.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.320
Something happened here.
Recently.

11:36.070 --> 11:37.030
Kevin Crocker. Come on.
It's time to go.

11:38.490 --> 11:40.990
And don’t even think about
doing anything stupid.

11:41.610 --> 11:42.530
[Mal]
Hold on.

11:45.870 --> 11:46.790
Who are you?

11:46.830 --> 11:48.000
Don't worry about who I am,

11:48.040 --> 11:48.950
Mr. Doyle.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.410
[car revving]

11:50.460 --> 11:51.330
[crash]

11:56.130 --> 11:57.000
Everybody okay?

11:58.670 --> 11:59.550
You're welcome.

12:02.550 --> 12:04.550
Okay. Come on.

12:05.600 --> 12:06.720
Hold on a second.

12:07.430 --> 12:08.350
Yeah, hello police.

12:08.390 --> 12:10.270
I need to leave a message

12:10.310 --> 12:13.230
directly for Daniel Hood, or
for Leslie Bennet please.

12:13.940 --> 12:15.020
[Crocker]
Let's go.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.320
Okay.
The lady of the night.

12:21.360 --> 12:23.110
Lisa Younghusband.

12:23.150 --> 12:25.490
Right. Was killed at
the old Rec Centre.

12:25.530 --> 12:27.160
Yes.
And, of course,

12:27.200 --> 12:28.910
the man accused of
murdering her is--

12:28.950 --> 12:30.000
My father.

12:31.040 --> 12:32.040
What's going
on, guys?

12:32.080 --> 12:33.160
Why are you
looking into this?

12:33.210 --> 12:34.670
Honey--
We're not sure. But-

12:34.710 --> 12:38.500
We think Malachy and Jake
are with Crocker.

12:38.550 --> 12:40.670
[Tinny] Kevin Crocker
is a wanted felon.

12:40.710 --> 12:41.840
Is he back in town?

12:41.880 --> 12:43.380
Are Poppy and Jake
helping him?

12:43.420 --> 12:45.260
Look, Tinny, we don't really
have any info on this right now.

12:45.300 --> 12:46.890
Malachy asked us to
look into it.

12:46.930 --> 12:48.220
And he said it was urgent.

12:48.260 --> 12:50.100
I'm guessing my phone
being bugged had something

12:50.140 --> 12:50.890
to do with this.

12:50.930 --> 12:52.270
Someone bugged your phone?

12:52.310 --> 12:55.650
Yeah. I thought it had to do
with uncle Jake, but--

12:55.690 --> 12:56.770
I guess whoever did it

12:56.810 --> 12:58.230
was looking for
something on Crocker.

12:59.440 --> 13:01.360
I've studied every inch
of this case.

13:02.490 --> 13:05.950
Honey, if we're getting
into this--

13:05.990 --> 13:07.200
there are ramifications--

13:07.240 --> 13:08.870
if the cops know
you're involved.

13:08.910 --> 13:11.950
I know, but I never
believed he did it.

13:13.790 --> 13:14.710
Why?

13:14.750 --> 13:16.420
He's my father. I just--

13:17.210 --> 13:18.330
[Rose]
I think that

13:18.380 --> 13:20.250
the odds are stacked against
him on this.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.210
I mean, the day Crocker
was arrested--

13:22.260 --> 13:23.510
His tox screen showed that

13:23.550 --> 13:26.010
he was filled with
drugs and alcohol. I know.

13:26.050 --> 13:28.970
Tinny. He had the victim’s blood
all over him.

13:29.010 --> 13:32.520
I know. All of this. Okay?

13:32.560 --> 13:35.190
But there is one glaring
issue here.

13:35.980 --> 13:37.440
The body was never found.

13:37.480 --> 13:38.560
How can you have a murder
without a body?

13:39.810 --> 13:41.650
The Prosecution's working
theory was that he

13:41.690 --> 13:43.900
dumped it in the ocean
and it just disappeared.

13:43.940 --> 13:45.030
Okay, Tinny. There's
just one thing

13:45.070 --> 13:46.110
that you're skipping over here.

13:46.150 --> 13:47.660
And it's a pretty
big point, is that--

13:47.700 --> 13:50.120
Crocker confessed the whole
thing to Jake.

13:50.160 --> 13:51.620
[ring]

13:52.410 --> 13:53.750
Malachy, what's going on?

13:53.790 --> 13:55.870
You have no idea how weird
this whole thing is.

13:55.910 --> 13:57.880
Can you run a track on a guy
named Brian Mitchell?

13:59.080 --> 14:00.960
You don't think it's just
a little bit odd?

14:01.000 --> 14:02.750
In the middle of all this,
out of nowhere--

14:02.800 --> 14:04.260
A hitman suddenly shows up
looking for me.

14:04.300 --> 14:05.670
[Smallwood]
So what?

14:05.720 --> 14:07.470
A guy's after you. You're scum.
Scum attracts scum.

14:07.510 --> 14:08.840
It's the law of the land.

14:08.890 --> 14:11.310
Regardless of your attitude.
I appreciate the save.

14:12.260 --> 14:13.270
Are we gonna let him go,
or what?

14:13.310 --> 14:14.430
[Crocker]
Nooo!

14:14.470 --> 14:15.640
Not until Smallwood here

14:15.680 --> 14:17.560
admits that he framed
me for the murder.

14:17.600 --> 14:18.520
And that he coughs up

14:18.560 --> 14:20.020
whoever it actually did it.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.940
I mean, no murder weapon.
No body. No case.

14:22.980 --> 14:24.190
Until this one--

14:24.230 --> 14:25.360
from--

14:25.400 --> 14:26.860
the Rat Squad.
He suddenly--

14:26.900 --> 14:28.070
shows up with the
murder weapon?

14:28.110 --> 14:29.110
Hey, listen to me.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.070
Nobody else
could find it, right?

14:30.120 --> 14:31.620
I mean, they
sent in teams,

14:31.660 --> 14:35.000
Squadrons, literally squadrons
of guys scoured that center.

14:35.040 --> 14:35.790
Nothing.

14:35.830 --> 14:37.080
And then him--

14:37.120 --> 14:39.040
The guy who'd been
investigating me for years.

14:39.080 --> 14:40.750
He suddenly shows up
with a gun?

14:40.790 --> 14:42.000
Kevin, you gotta calm down.

14:42.040 --> 14:42.960
No, I will not calm down.

14:44.090 --> 14:45.800
Because either
somebody planted that

14:45.840 --> 14:47.470
weapon and told
him where to find it.

14:47.510 --> 14:48.800
Or he planted it himself.

14:48.840 --> 14:50.470
I didn't plant anything.

14:50.510 --> 14:51.590
I didn't frame you.

14:51.640 --> 14:54.510
You did say that someone
gave you a tip.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.520
Right? Don't you find that
a bit convenient?

14:56.560 --> 14:58.350
Look, I know it
seems convenient.

14:58.390 --> 15:00.270
And I know there seems to be
something else going on here.

15:00.310 --> 15:02.150
Alright finally, he's starting
to make a little sense.

15:02.190 --> 15:05.070
But for all I know, Crocker
had an accomplice

15:05.110 --> 15:07.190
who helped him kill Lisa
Younghusband.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.860
Accomplice? And they say my
theories are crazy.

15:09.910 --> 15:11.120
You are crazy.

15:14.120 --> 15:15.700
Rose tells me the mad gun man

15:15.740 --> 15:17.000
is a hired heavy.

15:17.040 --> 15:18.250
Are you sure you never
saw him before?

15:18.290 --> 15:19.750
No! Never.

15:20.540 --> 15:21.250
What now?

15:21.290 --> 15:22.420
Now?

15:22.460 --> 15:25.920
Okay. Now we are all gonna
work together.

15:25.960 --> 15:28.130
And we are gonna piece
this thing.

15:28.170 --> 15:29.130
Together.

15:48.610 --> 15:49.490
Who's this?

15:52.160 --> 15:53.160
Hey buddy, wake up.

15:54.240 --> 15:55.120
[bang]

15:57.330 --> 15:58.250
[bang]

15:58.290 --> 16:00.790
Ah! Son of a bitch.

16:22.810 --> 16:23.810
Everything is in here.

16:25.020 --> 16:26.520
Anyone I had spoken
to. Anyone involved

16:26.560 --> 16:27.900
in the case.
It's all here.

16:27.940 --> 16:29.480
Who else had access to this?

16:29.530 --> 16:30.780
At this point, only me.

16:30.820 --> 16:32.450
[Jake] If you thought there
was a problem

16:32.490 --> 16:34.530
why didn't you run this further
up the chain?

16:34.570 --> 16:37.120
I don't know. I'll admit.

16:37.160 --> 16:39.870
It always felt to me
that someone-- Maybe on the

16:39.910 --> 16:41.580
inside was
working with Crocker.

16:41.620 --> 16:42.500
Working with me? Like who?

16:43.620 --> 16:46.920
Jake here? Or Malachy?
Or maybe no one.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.170
Maybe just you.

16:48.210 --> 16:49.170
Framing me.

16:49.210 --> 16:49.760
[punch]

16:50.300 --> 16:50.760
Kevin. Stop.

16:51.630 --> 16:53.340
I wanna know who set me up.

16:53.380 --> 16:56.220
And why. And right now.

16:56.260 --> 16:57.680
And you are the only one

16:57.720 --> 16:58.510
who can tell me.

16:59.560 --> 17:03.060
Alright. I started
getting letters.

17:03.770 --> 17:04.900
No return address.

17:04.940 --> 17:06.150
About year ago.

17:07.480 --> 17:09.270
Signed by "Regret"?

17:09.320 --> 17:10.730
Yeah.

17:10.780 --> 17:13.110
Proclaiming my innocence,
taking guilt upon themselves.

17:13.150 --> 17:14.030
And saying they should have
come forward?

17:14.740 --> 17:15.780
How'd you know that?

17:16.780 --> 17:17.780
I got the same letters when

17:17.820 --> 17:18.780
I was in prison.

17:18.830 --> 17:20.450
So we've no idea who
sent them.

17:20.490 --> 17:20.830
[Smallwood] No.

17:21.950 --> 17:23.120
But they certainly got
my attention.

17:24.290 --> 17:24.710
At first I thought
they were from him.

17:25.960 --> 17:28.210
My handwriting isn't
anywhere near as nice.

17:28.250 --> 17:30.130
Then I thought it was
a plan of yours.

17:30.170 --> 17:32.380
Getting your partner to send
in evidence.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.010
To get you out.

17:34.050 --> 17:35.590
That's not a bad plan.

17:35.630 --> 17:36.760
But I ran a trace.

17:37.760 --> 17:38.800
They didn't come
from the prison.

17:38.850 --> 17:39.930
They were
connected to anyone--

17:39.970 --> 17:41.010
he woulda called.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.560
Or had contact with on
the outside.

17:42.600 --> 17:43.520
So?

17:43.560 --> 17:44.480
So--

17:44.520 --> 17:45.690
The rat started digging.

17:46.560 --> 17:47.980
Getting pieces of evidence.

17:48.860 --> 17:50.320
It's all safe on my laptop.

17:50.360 --> 17:51.150
[Mal]
Your laptop?

17:51.900 --> 17:52.940
Are the files encrypted?

17:52.980 --> 17:53.030
Yeah.

17:54.570 --> 17:56.570
In case someone in the
force or higher up was involved

17:56.610 --> 17:57.950
[Mal]
You wanted to be sure

17:57.990 --> 17:59.950
that no one could tamper with
your investigation.

18:01.030 --> 18:02.370
Where's the laptop now?

18:02.410 --> 18:03.330
Outside, in my car.

18:04.540 --> 18:06.670
It's in a hidden compartment
in my trunk.

18:08.460 --> 18:10.290
Everything I've
gathered so far.

18:12.210 --> 18:14.340
Maybe, maybe it could
help you.

18:15.880 --> 18:17.550
[Crocker] I've been living
with this for a long, long time.

18:18.510 --> 18:19.930
And if you're lying, I will not

18:19.970 --> 18:21.970
hesitate to end you.
Are we clear?

18:22.390 --> 18:23.310
Yeah.

18:25.220 --> 18:27.270
Alright Jake, go with him
Grab the laptop.

18:27.310 --> 18:29.770
I'll stay with Malachy here. You
try anything, and I'll kill him.

18:29.810 --> 18:30.940
You understand?

18:30.980 --> 18:31.690
Right.

18:32.320 --> 18:33.520
For the record,

18:33.570 --> 18:35.110
I'm actually starting to
believe you're innocent.

18:35.900 --> 18:37.070
Jake, we need to run.

18:37.110 --> 18:37.780
Yes, b'y. I'm gonna leave my
father alone

18:37.820 --> 18:39.320
with a crazy person.

18:39.360 --> 18:41.160
You and I both know Crocker's
not gonna hurt your father.

18:41.780 --> 18:42.740
We get to my car.

18:42.780 --> 18:43.990
We get some help.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.080
Tell me the truth. Did you
set him up or not?

18:46.120 --> 18:47.620
Jake, we need to bring him in.
We'll work on what we have.

18:48.960 --> 18:50.790
I need another trial.
Present the new evidence.

18:51.540 --> 18:52.420
Keys.

18:58.880 --> 18:59.590
Ah!

19:00.140 --> 19:01.010
Sorry, Jake.

19:02.220 --> 19:03.140
Stop!

19:05.140 --> 19:06.560
No, Smallwood! No!

19:06.600 --> 19:07.730
[explosion]

19:24.160 --> 19:28.290
You didn't deserve this Craig.
You were a good Cop.

19:29.790 --> 19:31.880
And I owe so much to you
in my career--

19:32.880 --> 19:36.880
As a professional
and as a friend.

19:38.420 --> 19:42.140
I'm so sorry I let this
happen. I'm sorry.

19:45.180 --> 19:46.390
Any word from Jake?

19:46.720 --> 19:47.720
No.

19:47.770 --> 19:49.270
None of them are
answering my calls.

19:49.310 --> 19:50.350
And what about Hood?

19:51.350 --> 19:51.940
What in the hell
is going on here?

19:53.560 --> 19:55.940
Get everybody in the bullpen. We
are finding whoever did this.

19:55.980 --> 19:57.070
And we're gonna make them pay.

20:00.990 --> 20:02.610
[ring]

20:12.210 --> 20:13.460
You gonna be okay?

20:13.500 --> 20:15.420
Yeah. I'm Lucky. A lot luckier
than Smallwood.

20:17.170 --> 20:18.090
Just tell us now.

20:18.130 --> 20:19.510
Did you arrange all this?

20:19.550 --> 20:21.380
Yeah, Some sort of super
revenge plot against us

20:21.420 --> 20:22.760
and Smallwood?

20:22.800 --> 20:24.640
You've been known to make
crazier decisions Crocker.

20:24.680 --> 20:26.850
Did I hate him? Yes.
Did I want him to die? No.

20:26.890 --> 20:29.060
Why? Because he's the only one
who could prove my innocence.

20:29.100 --> 20:31.230
You told us ten times you
wanted to kill him.

20:31.270 --> 20:32.520
Oh, come on. Use your heads.

20:32.560 --> 20:34.270
That was a bluff.
I was bluffing.

20:34.310 --> 20:35.900
The only reason why
we're not turning

20:35.940 --> 20:37.110
you in right now,
is because of Tinny.

20:38.150 --> 20:39.570
[Mal] We gotta get
off this road.

20:39.610 --> 20:40.860
The cops are gonna be
everywhere.

20:40.900 --> 20:41.900
Good call.

20:43.780 --> 20:45.160
[Leslie] Craig Smallwood

20:45.200 --> 20:49.330
was a father, a friend,
and a great police officer.

20:49.370 --> 20:53.080
We all, every one of us on this
Force will feel his passing.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.710
I know that. It wasn't right.

20:57.590 --> 20:58.500
But listen to me carefully.

20:59.590 --> 21:01.800
We do not have time
for any of that.

21:03.010 --> 21:04.380
Not because it isn't the
right thing to do.

21:05.590 --> 21:07.010
Not because it isn't
our right to grieve.

21:08.180 --> 21:09.890
But because we will not
waste a moment

21:09.930 --> 21:11.520
of our energy

21:11.560 --> 21:14.480
on anything other than finding
whoever killed Craig Smallwood.

21:14.520 --> 21:15.480
Is that understood?

21:17.110 --> 21:18.440
Go. Get them.

21:18.480 --> 21:20.780
And somebody find me
Sergeant Hood now.

21:21.400 --> 21:22.740
Doyle. Come here.

21:24.280 --> 21:24.820
Run this by Forensics.

21:25.740 --> 21:27.030
See if you can find something

21:27.070 --> 21:28.160
to match whatever ignited

21:28.200 --> 21:29.370
Craig's car. Please.

21:29.410 --> 21:31.160
I don't know if this is
relevant, or what.

21:31.200 --> 21:34.830
But-- I got a good suspicion
that my father is back in town.

21:34.870 --> 21:36.210
A good suspicion?

21:36.250 --> 21:37.210
I haven't seen him.

21:37.250 --> 21:40.800
But, yeah. Kevin
Crocker is back.

21:41.750 --> 21:42.960
Smallwood, before he died,

21:43.010 --> 21:43.800
he said he was working
on your father's case.

21:45.300 --> 21:47.680
Sergeant. I got a feeling this
is all connected somehow.

21:47.720 --> 21:49.550
Are you sure you're on
the right side of this?

21:50.350 --> 21:51.600
In your head, I mean?

21:52.270 --> 21:53.310
What are you saying?

21:53.350 --> 21:54.520
We're talking about
your family here.

21:55.850 --> 21:58.100
I'm not sure you should be
even near this case.

21:58.150 --> 21:58.190
Leslie.

21:59.810 --> 22:02.650
I know my father had nothing
to do with Smallwood's death.

22:02.690 --> 22:03.900
Let alone Jake.

22:05.360 --> 22:06.780
Is that from Dispatch?

22:08.740 --> 22:10.030
Someone sent a message--

22:10.070 --> 22:11.410
directly to you
and Hood.

22:12.120 --> 22:13.200
If Hood responded...

22:17.170 --> 22:18.210
So, you're like--

22:19.250 --> 22:21.420
definitely Tinny's
father, right?

22:22.840 --> 22:23.710
She's nice.

22:24.590 --> 22:25.170
She's great.

22:25.800 --> 22:27.590
Signed, Regret.

22:28.090 --> 22:29.300
Cryptic.

22:29.340 --> 22:31.260
You got the same letters
from the same person?

22:31.300 --> 22:32.220
And emails.

22:32.260 --> 22:33.810
Once I got out of prison,

22:33.850 --> 22:35.980
whoever that is sent
emails to that account

22:36.020 --> 22:37.390
[Des] Yeah, it's gonna
be hard to track this.

22:37.440 --> 22:38.560
The origin of these
emails is coded.

22:38.600 --> 22:39.520
I mean, I'm good,

22:39.560 --> 22:41.060
But I'm nowhere near
that good.

22:41.110 --> 22:43.400
You didn't try to meet with
whoever was sending you these?

22:43.440 --> 22:45.030
[Crocker] No. It
could've been a trap.

22:45.070 --> 22:46.650
Trying to lure me
out of hiding.

22:46.690 --> 22:48.950
But I came back anyway because
I was sick of running.

22:48.990 --> 22:52.580
Now, Regret claims that he or
she has irrefutable evidence

22:52.620 --> 22:54.080
that I did not kill
Lisa Younghusband.

22:54.120 --> 22:55.450
[Jake]
When you sent the emails,

22:55.490 --> 22:57.370
How long did it take for them
to get back to you?

22:57.410 --> 22:59.500
Well, honestly, I'd
send an email, I'd get a reply

22:59.540 --> 23:00.580
straight away.

23:02.540 --> 23:03.800
What, are you thinking what
I'm thinking?

23:04.300 --> 23:05.210
Email.

23:05.260 --> 23:06.170
Bait.

23:06.210 --> 23:07.170
We'll set up a meet right now.

23:07.220 --> 23:08.130
Then we have our witness.

23:08.170 --> 23:09.090
[Jake]
Or, if it's a fake,

23:09.130 --> 23:10.010
we'll have
Smallwood's killer.

23:11.800 --> 23:12.510
Message sent.

23:12.550 --> 23:14.100
Let's talk now.

23:14.140 --> 23:15.850
I debated putting a winky face
there. 'Cause normally when--

23:15.890 --> 23:17.480
I text Tinny, we do.

23:18.730 --> 23:19.310
Hey, Rose.

23:20.480 --> 23:22.020
The guy you pulled the cell
phone from?

23:22.060 --> 23:24.610
Yeah, Brian Mitchell. He's the
hit man who almost killed us.

23:24.650 --> 23:28.150
Yeah. I tracked his phone to the
store that it was sold at and

23:28.190 --> 23:29.820
well, it cost me
three hundred bucks.

23:29.860 --> 23:30.700
But the clerk eventually caved.

23:30.740 --> 23:32.200
What is it?

23:32.240 --> 23:34.160
Surveillance video from the
past two days at the store.

23:34.200 --> 23:34.950
Nice work.

23:34.990 --> 23:36.120
Thank you.

23:36.160 --> 23:37.290
I'm thinking whoever bought
that phone--

23:37.330 --> 23:37.830
likely is on that tape.

23:37.870 --> 23:38.750
[email sound]

23:38.790 --> 23:40.210
[Des]
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

23:40.250 --> 23:42.330
It's the Regret Person.
Ten minutes. Gosling Library.

23:42.880 --> 23:42.920
Let's go.

23:44.170 --> 23:45.420
I'll start sorting through
this footage.

23:53.140 --> 23:54.720
[siren]

24:09.740 --> 24:10.610
Hood!

24:12.160 --> 24:13.280
I got it. I think.

24:14.700 --> 24:16.530
I went through all the vids of
the security footage

24:16.580 --> 24:17.290
at the store where
the phone was bought.

24:17.330 --> 24:18.660
What's you find, honey?

24:18.700 --> 24:20.580
Well, in the past two days,
buddy sold three phones.

24:21.290 --> 24:22.580
I zoomed in on the faces

24:22.620 --> 24:25.840
of each buyer. And only
one bought a red phone.

24:25.880 --> 24:27.590
And that is not
Brian Mitchell.

24:27.630 --> 24:30.050
That is Christina Lang.
St. John's Crown Attorney.

24:30.090 --> 24:31.010
[Des]
And why is she buying

24:31.050 --> 24:32.300
a burner
for a hit man?

24:32.340 --> 24:33.720
That's a heluva good question.

24:33.760 --> 24:34.890
It is, isn't it?

24:41.310 --> 24:42.440
So how do we know who
we're meeting?

24:43.480 --> 24:45.310
I got a feeling they'll
know you.

25:20.890 --> 25:22.060
[Jake]
Lisa Younghusband.

25:22.100 --> 25:23.020
You're--

25:23.060 --> 25:24.560
Alive. Yeah.

25:25.520 --> 25:26.560
[Jake]
Kinda hard for you to be

25:26.600 --> 25:27.560
the murderer--

25:27.610 --> 25:28.730
of a person who's still alive?

25:28.770 --> 25:30.110
Yeah, I got that. Thanks.

25:36.110 --> 25:38.410
[Crocker] So, obviously, you've
been alive all this time.

25:39.160 --> 25:41.660
I have. Yeah. I have.

25:43.290 --> 25:46.290
Would you mind terribly telling
us exactly what is going on?

25:46.330 --> 25:47.710
Because that would be great.

25:47.750 --> 25:49.630
You know, if it's not
too inconvenient.

25:49.670 --> 25:50.630
I don't know where to start.

25:50.670 --> 25:52.050
How about you start around

25:52.090 --> 25:53.840
about the time when you and
a bunch of other people

25:53.880 --> 25:54.510
decided to ruin my life.

25:55.840 --> 25:57.970
Kevin, you know how messed
up I was back then.

25:58.010 --> 25:59.140
We both were.

25:59.640 --> 25:59.930
I can--

26:01.600 --> 26:04.270
At least until I got clean, I
could barely remember anything.

26:04.310 --> 26:05.190
[ring]

26:08.810 --> 26:09.690
Excuse me.

26:13.610 --> 26:14.650
Dad, what do you got?

26:14.690 --> 26:16.030
We don't have the
full story yet.

26:16.070 --> 26:17.450
We think Christina Lang
is the mastermind.

26:18.110 --> 26:19.110
The Crown Attorney.

26:19.160 --> 26:20.530
Yeah, we don't have
much evidence,

26:20.570 --> 26:22.910
but we think she hired
Mitchell to kill Smallwood.

26:22.950 --> 26:25.620
That doesn't seem
to fit her profile.

26:25.660 --> 26:26.660
Are you guys sure about this?

26:26.710 --> 26:28.210
The pieces don't fit completely,

26:28.250 --> 26:30.580
but we have video evidence of
her buying the burner phone.

26:30.630 --> 26:32.380
We don't have enough that will
hold up in court.

26:32.420 --> 26:34.300
We need more before
the cops can use this.

26:34.340 --> 26:35.380
[Jake] Okay, I'll look into it.

26:35.420 --> 26:36.300
I'll get back to you.

26:39.340 --> 26:40.760
What does Christina Lang

26:40.800 --> 26:42.010
have to do with
any of this?

26:42.050 --> 26:42.970
More than you'd expect.

26:43.560 --> 26:44.850
Explain. Now.

26:46.060 --> 26:47.100
Thirteen years ago,

26:47.140 --> 26:49.440
she paid me to disappear.
For good.

26:50.190 --> 26:50.610
It was a lot of money.

26:52.190 --> 26:54.650
It wasn't until I got clean
that I put two and two together.

26:55.230 --> 26:56.110
They framed you.

26:57.150 --> 26:58.400
Lang was behind it all.

26:58.450 --> 26:59.820
She got your DNA.

26:59.860 --> 27:01.910
She planted the murder weapon.
She tipped off the cops.

27:03.280 --> 27:04.540
What could you have
done to Lang

27:04.580 --> 27:06.000
to piss her off
that much?

27:06.040 --> 27:06.290
Honestly,

27:07.830 --> 27:09.870
I was using pretty heavily
back then too. I have no idea.

27:10.920 --> 27:12.330
[Lisa] She said
something about--

27:12.380 --> 27:14.420
You being too close to
something. I don't know.

27:14.460 --> 27:14.710
Something to do with a lawyer.

27:15.630 --> 27:16.920
[Jake]
This all happened around

27:16.960 --> 27:19.010
the time that Lang got
the gig to become a Crown.

27:19.050 --> 27:20.380
[Crocker]
I was investigating a case

27:20.430 --> 27:22.260
involving drugs connecting
to other

27:22.300 --> 27:24.060
case that had been
thrown out of court.

27:25.470 --> 27:26.310
So Christina Lang is
the Kingpin.

27:27.770 --> 27:31.020
She was using Mitchell to do
her dirty work. You know,

27:31.940 --> 27:35.230
Look, fine. You were a junkie.

27:35.270 --> 27:36.990
So you flipped on me.
Framed me. I get that.

27:38.240 --> 27:39.950
But why did you take so long
to come forward?

27:41.450 --> 27:44.030
I've been in jail, or I've been
on the run ever since.

27:45.530 --> 27:46.120
You and I had a
lot of bad blood.

27:47.750 --> 27:49.540
You're the one who pretty much
got me hooked on H, remember?

27:50.500 --> 27:52.170
I guess I wanted
you to suffer.

27:53.290 --> 27:54.290
[Jake] This has gone
on long enough.

27:55.500 --> 27:58.050
We need you to talk to the
cops. Right now.

27:59.300 --> 28:00.970
[fire alarm rings]

28:01.550 --> 28:02.430
What is this?

28:03.390 --> 28:04.300
It's the Hit Man.

28:04.720 --> 28:05.720
[bang]

28:07.560 --> 28:08.730
What's going on?

28:10.430 --> 28:11.390
You still got that gun?

28:11.810 --> 28:12.690
Oh no.

28:14.440 --> 28:15.110
[bang]

28:15.150 --> 28:16.520
[Mitchell] Gentlemen!

28:16.570 --> 28:18.860
Let's not make this any
harder than it needs to be.

28:21.150 --> 28:22.200
We gotta get outta here.

28:23.360 --> 28:25.580
[banging]

28:29.750 --> 28:31.460
Hold on, buddy.
You're gonna be fine.

28:31.500 --> 28:32.040
Les.

28:32.790 --> 28:34.460
Smallwood. Smallwood.

28:34.500 --> 28:35.090
[Leslie]
You're gonna make it.

28:36.170 --> 28:38.250
We're lucky we found
you when we did.

28:41.590 --> 28:42.510
What is this?

28:44.390 --> 28:45.470
Smallwood's watch?

28:49.970 --> 28:50.850
[banging]

28:51.770 --> 28:52.690
Go.

28:52.730 --> 28:53.640
Alright.

28:53.690 --> 28:54.770
[banging]

28:55.230 --> 28:56.310
[banging]

28:57.440 --> 28:59.110
[banging]

29:02.070 --> 29:02.990
He's gonna kill us.

29:03.030 --> 29:04.530
Just calm down.

29:04.570 --> 29:05.530
[banging]

29:05.570 --> 29:06.620
[Crocker]
I'm running out.

29:06.660 --> 29:07.620
I knew I shouldn't
have come back.

29:07.660 --> 29:08.950
This is all your fault.

29:09.620 --> 29:10.830
[banging]

29:10.870 --> 29:13.160
Look. I know this isn't an
optimal situation.

29:13.210 --> 29:15.580
But I need you to not run
out into the open.

29:15.630 --> 29:17.670
[banging]

29:18.130 --> 29:19.460
[banging]

29:21.210 --> 29:22.170
[Lisa screams]

29:22.210 --> 29:23.130
We gotta get her back.

29:27.010 --> 29:29.350
This isn't over.
If you ever wanna

29:29.390 --> 29:30.970
see this one alive again,

29:31.020 --> 29:33.270
you'll find me. Got it?

29:35.650 --> 29:36.600
Great.

29:47.860 --> 29:50.330
I got the report on the wire you
found in Smallwood’s driveway.

29:50.370 --> 29:51.740
Just standard electrical.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.120
I'll keep looking into it.

29:56.330 --> 29:58.130
Did Hood have Inspector
Smallwood's watch?

29:58.170 --> 29:59.460
What's the deal there?

29:59.500 --> 30:02.130
My guess was Smallwood was
there before he died--

30:02.170 --> 30:03.420
Where they found Hood.

30:03.460 --> 30:05.130
So whoever planted
the bomb in his car--

30:05.170 --> 30:06.890
Likely shot Hood.

30:11.430 --> 30:12.310
What is it?

30:15.430 --> 30:16.140
Look familiar?

30:16.770 --> 30:18.100
it's an SD card

30:18.150 --> 30:19.360
for a smart phone.

30:21.730 --> 30:22.940
Find a way

30:22.980 --> 30:24.570
to get into this,
completely on the down low.

30:25.490 --> 30:26.650
I know just the way to do it.

30:32.950 --> 30:33.490
[Crocker] Look, what
are you doing?

30:34.290 --> 30:35.330
We need to find Mitchell.

30:35.370 --> 30:36.750
If Lisa dies then this entire
thing

30:36.790 --> 30:37.580
is for nothing.

30:37.620 --> 30:39.000
Christina Lang please.

30:39.040 --> 30:41.340
You know, compassion really is
your number one quality.

30:44.960 --> 30:46.050
Oh, okay thank you.
Thank you very much.

30:47.590 --> 30:49.050
Lang didn't show up to the
office today. She's not at work.

30:50.140 --> 30:51.510
If she's behind this,
she'll know

30:51.550 --> 30:52.760
where Mitchell has taken Lisa.

30:52.800 --> 30:54.270
I guess we'll need
her home address.

31:10.280 --> 31:11.160
[Jake]
Nothing.

31:12.660 --> 31:13.280
You got anything?

31:14.080 --> 31:16.500
Yeah. You could say that.

31:26.670 --> 31:29.090
[Jake] I know how this
looks. It looks bad.

31:29.470 --> 31:30.340
Bad?

31:31.890 --> 31:34.930
Kevin Crocker, a dead body,
a dead police inspector.

31:34.970 --> 31:37.390
And now Hood is in the hospital
fighting for his life.

31:37.430 --> 31:38.350
Would you not touch

31:38.390 --> 31:39.600
anything?
Please.

31:40.770 --> 31:42.690
So however bad you think
this is, Jake--

31:42.730 --> 31:44.610
It is much, much worse.

31:44.650 --> 31:47.690
We thought that Christina Lang
was behind this whole thing.

31:47.730 --> 31:49.450
But that doesn't make any sense,
now of course,

31:49.490 --> 31:50.950
because she's dead.

31:50.990 --> 31:52.160
[Leslie] It looks like
she was strangled

31:52.200 --> 31:53.910
with the same gauge
and grade of wire

31:53.950 --> 31:55.580
that I found in
Smallwood’s driveway.

31:56.160 --> 31:57.240
The car bomb.

31:57.290 --> 31:58.500
Whoever killed Lang--

31:59.080 --> 32:00.120
killed Smallwood.

32:00.160 --> 32:00.960
That would be Mitchell.
The hit man.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.630
And he's got Lisa held
hostage.

32:03.670 --> 32:05.250
Lisa Younghusband is dead.

32:05.840 --> 32:06.130
Wrong.

32:06.460 --> 32:08.090
Wrong?

32:08.130 --> 32:11.130
As far as I recall, you're the
chief suspect in her murder--

32:11.170 --> 32:14.890
For which you skipped trial. And
are now on the run from the law.

32:14.930 --> 32:16.720
We, we met Lisa.

32:16.760 --> 32:19.350
And I can assure
you, she is very much alive.

32:19.390 --> 32:20.310
[ring]

32:20.350 --> 32:21.270
Sorry.

32:21.310 --> 32:22.100
Is that a joke?

32:22.140 --> 32:23.190
No, it's Dad.

32:23.230 --> 32:26.980
Oh well. Sorry.
It's Dad. Go ahead.

32:27.440 --> 32:28.320
Go on.

32:30.320 --> 32:31.490
What do you got?

32:31.530 --> 32:33.700
So, we looked into
Christina Lang's cases.

32:33.740 --> 32:35.820
She has the lowest conviction
rate amongst the Crown

32:35.870 --> 32:37.280
when it comes to
drug related cases.

32:37.330 --> 32:38.790
What does that mean?

32:38.830 --> 32:41.160
Smallwood was holding onto
some secret court transcripts

32:41.210 --> 32:41.830
that were supposed to be sealed

32:41.870 --> 32:43.330
[Jake] Okay.

32:43.370 --> 32:45.250
They're plea deal conversations
involving Christina Lang.

32:45.290 --> 32:47.040
It's her pleading out
drug cases.

32:47.090 --> 32:48.500
And there was another
Lawyer involved.

32:48.550 --> 32:49.130
[Jake] Who?

32:49.880 --> 32:51.210
[Mal]
Richardson.

32:51.260 --> 32:52.970
[Rose] We're on the edge
of uncovering a massive

32:53.010 --> 32:54.590
drug
conspiracy here.

32:54.640 --> 32:57.180
I'll call you back.

32:58.100 --> 32:59.600
I have some information that I'm

33:00.680 --> 33:02.190
pretty sure you're
not gonna like.

33:04.770 --> 33:06.650
And you have proof?

33:07.520 --> 33:08.690
You know I'm a judge, yes?

33:09.860 --> 33:11.190
I'm not accusing you of
anything.

33:12.110 --> 33:14.110
I'm asking you for your help.

33:14.150 --> 33:16.490
I have no idea what you're
talking about.

33:17.910 --> 33:20.080
And it certainly does
seem that you're accusing me

33:20.120 --> 33:21.910
of conspiring with
Christina Lang to throw

33:21.950 --> 33:23.830
out drug related convictions.

33:23.870 --> 33:26.630
No one is accusing
you of anything, Judge.

33:26.670 --> 33:27.380
Where is she, anyway?

33:27.920 --> 33:28.500
She's dead.

33:29.590 --> 33:31.630
We found her body a
short while ago.

33:32.880 --> 33:35.340
She's. She's dead?

33:36.090 --> 33:36.890
I know you two were--

33:37.890 --> 33:39.140
You worked many cases
together.

33:39.180 --> 33:40.060
I'm sorry.

33:41.850 --> 33:42.980
Is that all?

33:43.680 --> 33:45.140
That's all, for now.

33:47.600 --> 33:48.690
If there is a next time,

33:49.980 --> 33:52.190
make sure you have
something to ask me about.

33:53.530 --> 33:54.400
You got me?

34:00.530 --> 34:01.870
What now?

34:01.910 --> 34:03.790
Now we hope that he leads us
to Mitchell and Lisa.

34:03.830 --> 34:04.710
Come on.

34:32.650 --> 34:34.610
[Crocker] Shouldn't we be
calling in your backup?

34:34.650 --> 34:36.530
Mitchell might have
already killed Lisa by now.

34:36.570 --> 34:37.990
[Leslie] If Richardson is
involved in this,

34:38.030 --> 34:39.910
I have no idea how deeply
this goes into the Department.

34:41.160 --> 34:43.040
We're gonna have to take
him down ourselves.

34:43.870 --> 34:45.200
So. Plan?

34:45.250 --> 34:47.670
You two stay here.
I'll take care of things.

34:48.500 --> 34:49.420
I'll check it out first.

34:49.460 --> 34:50.840
Do not go in there.

34:53.840 --> 34:55.210
Real plan?

34:55.260 --> 34:57.300
We're gonna let her go in
there. Face a hit man alone?

34:57.340 --> 34:59.090
Not likely.
Let's go.

35:00.760 --> 35:03.260
Isn't this the place everyone
thought you did the first time?

35:03.850 --> 35:04.810
Yes.

35:05.680 --> 35:06.930
Ironic.

35:06.980 --> 35:09.230
That you're actually
gonna die here for real.

35:10.560 --> 35:11.730
Maybe it was meant to be.

35:12.360 --> 35:12.770
Mitchell.

35:14.400 --> 35:17.780
You have been making a very,
very large mess. You know that?

35:17.820 --> 35:19.030
Shooting up a library?

35:19.070 --> 35:20.910
Putting a bullet
in that bald cop.

35:20.950 --> 35:21.950
Not to mention--

35:21.990 --> 35:23.660
killing
Christina Lang.

35:23.700 --> 35:27.500
She was a liability. And she was
supposed to have killed this one

35:27.540 --> 35:28.120
years ago.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.120
Let's just get it over with.

35:30.830 --> 35:31.960
Get rid of her.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.210
Find Crocker,

35:33.250 --> 35:34.590
and then tell your employers

35:34.630 --> 35:36.670
we won't have any of these
kind of problems again.

35:39.130 --> 35:40.430
Kneel down.

35:40.470 --> 35:41.390
No.

35:41.430 --> 35:43.010
You don't have to do this.

35:43.050 --> 35:44.510
Yes. I do.

35:45.720 --> 35:48.270
Now, kneel down.

36:00.650 --> 36:02.780
Are you sure it's a good idea
to shoot her in here?

36:02.820 --> 36:05.620
In a few days, they're gonna
turn this place into condos.

36:06.240 --> 36:06.910
So?

36:06.950 --> 36:08.200
So.

36:08.250 --> 36:10.210
They're gonna pour
entirely new cement floors.

36:10.870 --> 36:11.960
We shoot her,

36:12.000 --> 36:13.370
wrap her up
in the tarp,

36:13.420 --> 36:15.590
tear up a couple of floor
boards and we stick her in.

36:15.630 --> 36:16.630
No. Please.

36:16.670 --> 36:17.880
Shut up.

36:19.510 --> 36:21.510
She'll be buried here for
a hundred years.

36:22.380 --> 36:24.260
Plus. I like the irony

36:24.300 --> 36:27.220
of her ending being here.
Don't you?

36:27.260 --> 36:29.520
Look. I don't know anything.

36:29.560 --> 36:32.310
Okay, I'll disappear.
I'll never come back.

36:32.350 --> 36:33.270
I promise.

36:33.310 --> 36:34.980
Whatever. Just do it quickly.

36:35.020 --> 36:36.690
No, no.

36:36.730 --> 36:37.860
You're gonna do it.

36:38.650 --> 36:39.820
And if you don't--

36:39.860 --> 36:41.150
Well--

36:41.190 --> 36:43.660
There's lots of floor space
for you down below.

36:55.500 --> 36:56.380
Sorry.

36:58.630 --> 36:59.510
[bang]

37:03.880 --> 37:04.800
Hold it.

37:04.840 --> 37:06.180
Easy, easy. You got me.

37:06.220 --> 37:07.100
Yeah, I got you.

37:07.140 --> 37:08.470
[punch]

37:08.510 --> 37:10.930
That's for Inspector
Smallwood, you piece of shit.

37:12.180 --> 37:14.350
If I was you, I'd get the hell
out of here.

37:14.400 --> 37:16.270
[punching]

37:17.440 --> 37:18.440
No!

37:18.480 --> 37:20.320
Kevin. Don't do it.

37:22.110 --> 37:23.320
Why?

37:23.360 --> 37:24.450
He deserves to die.

37:24.490 --> 37:25.490
Crocker, drop it.

37:25.530 --> 37:25.910
[Jake]
Look, Buddy.

37:27.030 --> 37:29.740
We spent all day,
you know, trying to

37:29.780 --> 37:31.580
clear you of one murder.
So please.

37:32.580 --> 37:34.420
Why don't we just
call it a day?

37:40.800 --> 37:42.510
I just wanna ask you
one question.

37:43.380 --> 37:44.130
Why didn't you just kill me?

37:45.300 --> 37:46.930
Why did you have to
pin a murder on me?

37:46.970 --> 37:50.220
It was easier to make the world
believe you were a corrupt cop.

37:51.060 --> 37:51.220
We kill you--

37:52.520 --> 37:55.310
And I got fifty of
her breathing down my neck

37:55.350 --> 37:56.520
It was--

37:57.440 --> 37:59.730
It was business.
That's all.

38:01.610 --> 38:04.240
Kevin, knock it off.

38:05.530 --> 38:06.160
If you kill him,

38:07.410 --> 38:10.280
your daughter, Tinny.
She's gonna kill me.

38:11.410 --> 38:16.670
So. Why don't you just
give me the gun?

38:29.600 --> 38:30.510
Thanks.

38:43.820 --> 38:44.690
You look good.

38:45.240 --> 38:46.240
Thanks.

38:46.740 --> 38:48.410
So do you.

38:48.450 --> 38:50.120
Being vindicated on
a murder charge

38:50.160 --> 38:51.780
does give a fella
a certain glow.

38:52.490 --> 38:53.870
I guess it would.

38:55.540 --> 38:57.040
Listen.

38:57.080 --> 39:01.170
Thanks for not being as bad
as everyone thought you were.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.750
[laughing]
Well, I don't know.

39:04.800 --> 39:06.760
I have had
my moments. But--

39:07.670 --> 39:08.720
murder was never one of them.

39:09.470 --> 39:11.390
Well, I'll take that.

39:13.890 --> 39:15.180
Sorry to interrupt some

39:15.220 --> 39:17.480
quality father-daughter time,
but--

39:18.640 --> 39:21.980
That's okay I should
get back to work--

39:22.020 --> 39:22.110
I'll see ya.

39:23.190 --> 39:24.520
You know I think
it's gonna be easier

39:24.570 --> 39:26.360
for you and me to see
each other these days.

39:26.400 --> 39:27.950
Yeah. Me too.

39:37.450 --> 39:38.370
Congrats.

39:38.410 --> 39:39.500
Thank you.

39:41.040 --> 39:42.290
Kevin, I--

39:44.630 --> 39:45.920
I don't know what to say.

39:46.880 --> 39:47.960
Well, how about you start with:

39:48.010 --> 39:49.050
I'm very sorry I
thought you were

39:49.090 --> 39:50.840
an unrepentant homicidal maniac.

39:50.880 --> 39:52.140
Then, we
can just move on.

39:57.520 --> 39:58.390
I am.

39:58.810 --> 39:59.690
Done.

40:03.230 --> 40:03.900
So what next?

40:04.610 --> 40:06.230
Well. I'm an escaped

40:06.270 --> 40:08.400
convict, so I supposed they
gotta keep me locked up in here

40:08.440 --> 40:10.400
until they process whatever
needs to be processed.

40:10.440 --> 40:12.700
But I'm hoping in a couple of
weeks, I'm free as a bird.

40:12.740 --> 40:13.740
Good for you.

40:15.530 --> 40:17.700
So Tinny tells me you have
a daughter too.

40:19.500 --> 40:20.920
She does, huh?

40:21.670 --> 40:23.540
Sloan. Is that her name?

40:23.580 --> 40:24.790
Yeah.

40:26.590 --> 40:28.710
Been a heluva couple of
years for us, hasn't it?

40:28.760 --> 40:30.050
Sure has.

40:30.090 --> 40:33.470
I guess we're just
really lucky.

40:34.510 --> 40:35.680
Ah well,

40:35.720 --> 40:37.220
my assistant here
tells me it's

40:38.180 --> 40:40.310
time for me to go
back inside.

40:44.690 --> 40:45.610
Thanks.

40:48.730 --> 40:49.650
Partner.

41:13.130 --> 41:14.010
Jake.

41:14.890 --> 41:15.800
Are you here to see Hood?

41:16.640 --> 41:17.680
Yeah. How's he making out?

41:19.010 --> 41:21.350
He lost a lot of blood.
But he's on the mend.

41:21.390 --> 41:23.100
Good. I'm glad to hear it.

41:23.690 --> 41:24.600
You should know.

41:24.640 --> 41:26.520
He insisted you not see him.

41:26.560 --> 41:27.810
He said you'd likely
send him back

41:27.860 --> 41:29.320
to intensive care.

41:29.360 --> 41:30.730
Yeah, well--

41:30.780 --> 41:32.240
I'm here to see you anyways.

41:34.780 --> 41:35.660
I got you these.

41:38.950 --> 41:42.580
Congrats on the fixed
prostate. Gary?

41:44.500 --> 41:47.460
In retrospect, I probably should
have removed the card

41:47.500 --> 41:48.750
when I stole those flowers.

41:48.790 --> 41:51.760
But, you know, it's the
thought that counts.

41:52.630 --> 41:53.840
Yeah.

41:57.890 --> 41:58.760
How are you doing?

41:59.930 --> 42:01.350
Smallwood was a good cop.

42:02.470 --> 42:03.640
He deserved better.

42:03.680 --> 42:05.020
Yeah, he did.

42:06.310 --> 42:07.810
They gave me his job.

42:09.020 --> 42:10.440
Acting Inspector.

42:12.360 --> 42:14.490
But according to the Brass, they
want to make it permanent.

42:15.530 --> 42:17.200
And how do you feel
about that?

42:17.240 --> 42:19.740
I feel a whole lot of things.

42:22.160 --> 42:24.460
What do you say we get outta
here and I take you home?

42:26.250 --> 42:27.210
I would really,
really like that.

42:28.670 --> 42:31.000
See that’s the kind of
response I was hoping for.

42:31.040 --> 42:32.670
No Jake, not like that!

42:32.710 --> 42:35.220
Well, you can't blame a fella
for being enthusiastic.

42:36.930 --> 42:38.090
Hi.

42:38.140 --> 42:39.050
Hi Des.

42:39.090 --> 42:39.970
What are you--?

42:42.760 --> 42:43.810
I'm dating Tinny.
