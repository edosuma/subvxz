Wow. I can't believe
you're gettin' out today.

00:11.011 --> 00:14.948
You could earn some time-off

good things for the warden.

I'm in here
for 20 years, Earl.

to spend 10 straight years

Is that from cleanin'
or strippin'?

I thought you might
be cheesed off.

We shook on it, remember?

Both our hands were
a little damp, so they made
that farty noise and we giggled?

you've been givin' me
has made me look so competent.

04:04.812 --> 04:06.647
[ Earl Narrating ]
The point of
solitary confinement...

04:06.714 --> 04:09.350
is to break down
a prisoner's mental state...

Fortunately, state law said
that each week I had the right
to a weekly prayer service.
