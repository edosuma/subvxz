[BO narrating]
Previously on Lost Girl:

00:07.258 --> 00:08.338
[30]
I need to find the Pyrippus.

00:08.551 --> 00:10.416
It's been depicted as a
stallion that breathes fire.

00:10.636 --> 00:12.627
[KENZI] I think we can
control it with this.

00:12.847 --> 00:14.553
[BC]
The Pyrippus is me.

00:14.765 --> 00:15.424
[JACK]
How we doinI this morning?

00:15.641 --> 00:17.757
Knock me up, lock me up,
and now you wanna chat.

00:17.977 --> 00:20.639
[TAMSIN] Bo, you have to
help me! He took my wings!

00:20.855 --> 00:21.935
You don't need Tamsin.

00:22.148 --> 00:24.434
I have no intention
of killing Tamsin,

00:24.650 --> 00:26.060
[JACK] the baby will
do that all by itself.

00:26.277 --> 00:27.813
There's something
I need you to do.

00:28.029 --> 00:28.643
[BO] Kenzi, it's me.

00:28.863 --> 00:30.819
I need you to get everyone
and meet me at the clubhouse.

00:31.032 --> 00:31.942
We are completely trapped.

00:32.158 --> 00:32.817
Jack did this.

00:33.034 --> 00:34.274
[JACK]
What do you want to do?

00:34.493 --> 00:35.824
Let them burn.

00:36.037 --> 00:37.402
[grunting]

00:37.622 --> 00:40.284
If I let this go,
the whole building comes down.

00:40.499 --> 00:42.239
[DYSON grunts]

00:42.460 --> 00:46.203
Kenzi... Kenzi look.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.664
The--The horseshoe.

00:51.802 --> 00:54.009
[coughing]

00:54.222 --> 00:56.258
[DYSON growling]
[distant crashing]

00:59.185 --> 01:00.675
[BRUCE] Hey, guys.

01:01.938 --> 01:07.149
[coughing]

01:10.529 --> 01:12.065
It's the end of an era.

01:13.282 --> 01:14.067
[KENZI]
W-Why are you here?

01:14.283 --> 01:17.116
I mean,
Bruce how did you know?

01:17.328 --> 01:18.488
Bo called.

01:18.704 --> 01:19.989
Told me to meet her here.

01:20.206 --> 01:21.696
Bo did this.

01:22.375 --> 01:26.118
No. No don't--don't think
that for a second.

01:26.337 --> 01:28.578
[KENZI] She called Bruce.

01:28.798 --> 01:30.163
She trapped us!

01:30.383 --> 01:32.248
She also planted this!

01:32.468 --> 01:34.754
Okay, sh-she--
she took it from my bag

01:34.971 --> 01:36.757
and she put it
there to help us.

01:36.973 --> 01:39.635
I've seen this thing
shield Bo from fire.

01:39.850 --> 01:41.101
She knew it would protect us.

01:41.310 --> 01:44.222
But what's the point of
tryin' to murder us anyways?

01:44.897 --> 01:46.728
To prove allegiance.

01:47.191 --> 01:49.728
This must be part of her
plan to take down Hades.

01:49.944 --> 01:53.528
Yeah, and she wants him
to think that we're dead,

01:53.739 --> 01:55.570
so we have to play along.

01:57.159 --> 02:00.287
We need to move, we need
to get to the Elders.

02:00.997 --> 02:03.238
But how do we travel
and stay invisible?

02:04.250 --> 02:05.865
[MARK]
I've got an idea.

02:06.377 --> 02:08.413
It's a good one, I swear.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.631
Goodbye, crack shack.

02:16.721 --> 02:19.804
Bo, this better be
the greatest plan ever.

02:24.562 --> 02:26.018
[MARK] Come on.

02:33.321 --> 02:36.734
Father and daughter,
finally side by side.

02:36.949 --> 02:39.611
It's time to
fulfill your destiny.

02:39.827 --> 02:42.284
There's nothing left
to hold you back.

02:47.293 --> 02:48.123
[30}
There is one thing.

02:48.336 --> 02:49.542
[JACK] Hm?

02:49.754 --> 02:50.834
[30}
Your backup plan.

02:51.047 --> 02:52.162
I don't want her around.

02:52.381 --> 02:54.497
[JACK] Sibling rivalry.

02:54.717 --> 02:56.378
You're reminding me
more and more of myself.

02:56.594 --> 02:58.255
You only have
one daughter.

02:58.471 --> 03:00.007
l'm it.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.216
Consider it taken care of.

03:05.436 --> 03:07.472
[BO] Wait.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.679
I wanna do it.

03:09.899 --> 03:11.730
I wanna kill Tamsin.

03:20.618 --> 03:22.700
Bo?

03:22.912 --> 03:26.871
[TAMSIN panting]

03:27.083 --> 03:31.998
Bo, whatever he did to you,
you need to snap out of it.

03:33.839 --> 03:35.249
Do you hear me?

03:36.759 --> 03:41.002
Listen, I know what it's like.

03:41.222 --> 03:43.759
Jack took control of me in
Valhalla, do you remember?

03:43.974 --> 03:46.135
[TAMSIN] And you
helped me out of it.

03:46.352 --> 03:49.844
You have the power
to fight him.

03:52.358 --> 03:54.144
Please say something.

03:54.360 --> 03:55.850
Bo...

03:56.070 --> 03:58.277
[TAMSIN]
Bo, say something.

04:29.770 --> 04:32.011
Time to get my destiny on...

04:32.231 --> 04:34.062
...Daddy.

04:38.154 --> 04:43.148
[opening theme]

04:46.495 --> 04:48.360
First things first, we gotta
get word to the Elders,

04:48.581 --> 04:49.286
get them mobilized.

04:49.498 --> 04:51.489
[MARK] A proper defense is only
as good as its counter-offense.

04:51.709 --> 04:55.327
[DYSON] Whatever Bo's plan is,
we'll give 'em one helluva fight.

04:55.546 --> 04:58.413
[KENZI] Who needs weapons when
you've got mascara and heels.

04:58.632 --> 05:01.294
Hey, those Louboutin's
could take an eye out.

05:01.510 --> 05:03.011
[LAUREN] Vex, where do
you keep your tweezers,

05:03.220 --> 05:04.300
and duct tape,
your pharmaceuticals--

05:04.513 --> 05:07.050
--[horn blaring]
--[LAUREN] Watch out!

05:07.975 --> 05:09.215
Hey, let's get
something straight,

05:09.435 --> 05:11.346
as long as we're in my
motorized caravan,

05:11.562 --> 05:13.598
there'll be no
backseat driving, all right?

05:13.814 --> 05:15.350
Hey, put those back!

05:15.566 --> 05:17.227
You know, of all the
creepy fetishes,

05:17.443 --> 05:18.774
how is this your
weirdest, hmm?

05:18.986 --> 05:22.399
I'll have you know, that is
German Weimar porcelain.

05:22.615 --> 05:25.277
I've got a life
outside of you people.

05:25.493 --> 05:27.484
Get us there fast.
Get us there safe.

05:27.703 --> 05:28.943
We're in your hands.

05:29.705 --> 05:31.320
[VEX]
Excuse me.

05:33.584 --> 05:34.824
[BO] There I am.

05:35.044 --> 05:37.456
Fire-breathing
mass destruction.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.332
Should I pick up some Tums?

05:39.548 --> 05:41.334
[JACK]
Oh, these are not flames.

05:41.550 --> 05:43.836
These are
streams of life force.

05:44.053 --> 05:45.759
Chi.

05:45.971 --> 05:47.222
Consumed by my daughter...

05:47.431 --> 05:50.423
My Pyrippus.

05:54.939 --> 05:56.975
I'm gonna feed off
the entire city.

05:57.191 --> 05:58.522
[JACK]
First the colony.

05:58.734 --> 06:00.270
Then the continent.

06:00.486 --> 06:02.477
And once we're strong enough--

06:04.615 --> 06:05.320
The world.

06:05.533 --> 06:07.615
[JACK]
Every single human and Fae.

06:08.994 --> 06:11.656
I know you didn't kill Tamsin.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.954
My sweet daughter.

06:14.166 --> 06:17.408
It's time to cut
your long game short.

06:17.628 --> 06:22.497
If you didn't think this was
real, why did you play along?

06:23.342 --> 06:25.333
Because.

06:27.471 --> 06:31.635
l have you right
where I want you.

06:33.561 --> 06:35.097
[BO gasps]

06:37.565 --> 06:38.475
What is this?

06:38.691 --> 06:43.401
[JACK] The Helshoes that took
you to Valhalla serve me.

06:44.697 --> 06:47.188
I made them to keep
you where I want you.

06:47.408 --> 06:50.400
Until you feed.

06:50.619 --> 06:51.904
I will never.

06:52.121 --> 06:54.203
It's your nature, Succubus.

06:54.415 --> 06:56.406
You can't avoid what
you were made for.

06:56.625 --> 06:57.785
You can't make me do this.

06:58.002 --> 06:59.333
| emancipated myself from you.

06:59.545 --> 07:01.126
l have nothing
to do with you!

07:01.338 --> 07:03.294
Nothing to do with me?

07:04.883 --> 07:09.422
Our connection runs much
deeper than a hand print.

07:09.638 --> 07:11.344
Deeper than Helshoes.

07:11.557 --> 07:13.343
It runs deeper than blood.

07:13.559 --> 07:14.969
| created you.

07:15.185 --> 07:16.391
For me.

You didn't raise me.

07:19.398 --> 07:22.105

good mother, Mary Dennis.

07:22.318 --> 07:24.400
You had nothing to do with me.
You don't have a say.

07:24.612 --> 07:26.443
I don't have a say?

07:26.655 --> 07:28.566
I don't have a say.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.398
Hmph, you're right.

07:34.288 --> 07:37.280
But even if I
didn't raise you.

07:37.499 --> 07:39.410
Even if I wasn't in your life,

07:39.627 --> 07:42.710
you found death
all on your own.

07:42.921 --> 07:43.956
Remember...

07:44.173 --> 07:46.004
Your first...?

07:46.634 --> 07:48.465
Kyle was a long time ago.

07:48.677 --> 07:49.507
It was a mistake.

07:49.720 --> 07:51.460
And l have learned since then.

07:52.264 --> 07:54.471
Have you?

07:54.683 --> 07:57.425
[JACK] 'Cause it seems
to me that death...

07:57.645 --> 07:59.385
just keeps following you.

07:59.605 --> 08:01.015
Hale, Rainer, Trick, Aife...

08:01.231 --> 08:03.017
No. You killed Aife.

08:03.233 --> 08:04.188
You killed Trick.

08:04.401 --> 08:07.939
I did it for you! To lead
you to this very moment.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.737
Death is your birthright.
It is your path.

08:10.949 --> 08:14.362
It's a path you can't
force me to follow.

08:14.578 --> 08:19.163
Bo, it's time for you
to embrace your true self.

08:19.375 --> 08:19.704
No.

08:19.917 --> 08:21.032
Enjoy it!

08:21.251 --> 08:22.957
Once you start,
you won't be able to stop.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.126
You will love it.

08:25.339 --> 08:27.250
[JACK]
I know you can feel it.

08:27.466 --> 08:28.751
The hunger.

08:28.967 --> 08:30.548
The darkness.

08:30.761 --> 08:32.922
The power.

08:33.806 --> 08:36.468
You've tried to run
from it for years, but...

08:36.684 --> 08:38.345
it's not a choice.

08:38.560 --> 08:40.425
I stopped running
a long time ago.

08:40.646 --> 08:42.011
I found my family.

08:42.231 --> 08:43.266
Family?

08:43.482 --> 08:45.063
You mean Kenzi?

08:45.275 --> 08:46.731
Did she stay?

08:46.944 --> 08:49.481
Don't you dare.

08:49.697 --> 08:51.779
And Tamsin, poor Tamsin.

08:51.990 --> 08:55.153
She falls in love with you
and you break her heart.

08:55.369 --> 08:56.154
[JACK] Did she stay?

08:56.370 --> 08:56.859
Stop!

08:57.079 --> 08:59.161
[JACK] And then the thing
you wanted most...

08:59.373 --> 09:01.659
Imagine, a Succubus wanting
a Friday night date

09:01.875 --> 09:03.331
at the movies kind
of relationship.

09:03.544 --> 09:05.000
Huh? How'd that go for ya?

09:05.212 --> 09:07.498
Dyson.
That didn't last, no!

09:07.715 --> 09:10.502
And Lauren.

09:10.718 --> 09:13.380
Lauren dumped you
not once, but twice.

09:13.595 --> 09:15.972
And even if it had
worked out with Lauren,

09:16.181 --> 09:16.931
[JACK] eventually you
would have to watch her

09:17.141 --> 09:18.256
wither and die with age.

09:18.475 --> 09:21.057
Because death is a
part of who you are...

09:21.270 --> 09:22.476
No!

09:22.688 --> 09:25.020
Don't!

09:26.734 --> 09:29.441
You and I...

09:29.653 --> 09:32.565
We're not capable of love.

09:33.949 --> 09:36.156
Now feed.

09:46.086 --> 09:51.376
Only I will choose who lives.

09:51.592 --> 09:53.207

That's my girl.

10:35.928 --> 10:37.464
Glad we're on the same team.

10:37.679 --> 10:39.465
Well, I'm glad
you're leading us.

10:39.681 --> 10:41.296
We're gonna go get our girls.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.351
I used to worry
about her all the time.

10:46.563 --> 10:48.770
It's the nature
of the Succubus.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.518
But then she found her family.

10:50.734 --> 10:53.521
No, she found you.

10:53.737 --> 10:56.570
When you were together,
I didn't worry so much.

10:56.782 --> 11:00.115
Yeah, and then I
pushed her away.

11:00.327 --> 11:03.535
I know you think
you can't be with Bo,

11:03.747 --> 11:05.578
but you're wrong.

11:05.791 --> 11:08.533
It's messy. Yes,
it's complicated.

11:08.752 --> 11:09.992
And it's worth it.

11:13.632 --> 11:16.374
You know, I used to
worry about her.

11:16.593 --> 11:20.427
I mean, what would
happen to her when I die.

11:20.639 --> 11:23.381
Then I realized,
I don't have to.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.057
She'll have you.

Only a little.

11:49.459 --> 11:50.665

11:50.878 --> 11:53.790
We've seen this before,
but now it's the entire city.

11:54.006 --> 11:55.496
She's gone full Dark Queen.

11:55.716 --> 11:57.377
Or full-on Pyrippus...

11:57.593 --> 12:01.506
It doesn't make any sense,
how come we're not affected?

It's magically delicious.

12:07.895 --> 12:10.762
[LAUREN] Of course,
first the fire, now this.

12:10.981 --> 12:13.563
This horseshoe is protecting
us from all things Pyrippus.

12:13.775 --> 12:14.639
Yeah.

12:14.860 --> 12:16.725
But not the Elders.

12:22.993 --> 12:27.077
[JACK]
That's it, Bo. Beautiful.

12:27.289 --> 12:30.827
[JACK chuckling]

12:31.043 --> 12:34.035
Amazing.

12:34.254 --> 12:39.544
[chuckling]
Oh... Yes, yes.

12:39.760 --> 12:44.424
[cackling]

12:55.734 --> 12:57.019
[DYSON] No.

12:59.488 --> 13:00.648
[KENZI]
Doc, no pulse.

13:00.864 --> 13:02.320
[LAUREN] Oh no,
no there's nothing.

13:02.532 --> 13:04.944
I can't do anything.
They're gone.

13:05.160 --> 13:06.866
[MARK]
And so goes our man power.

13:07.079 --> 13:08.285
From what we just saw outside,

13:08.497 --> 13:11.364
does that mean
everyone but us is...?

13:11.583 --> 13:13.244
...is dead.

13:14.795 --> 13:17.787
Jack has completely
taken her over.

13:18.006 --> 13:20.463
She's lost...

13:20.676 --> 13:25.010
Bobo, what have you done?

13:29.184 --> 13:32.642
[DARK BO] I can be more
powerful than all other Fae.

13:32.854 --> 13:36.597
Everyone will
kneel at my feet.

13:36.817 --> 13:40.230
There will be no more
Dark and no more Light.

13:40.445 --> 13:42.697
There will be only me.

13:42.906 --> 13:45.022
My true army cometh.

13:45.242 --> 13:46.652
Humans.

13:46.868 --> 13:47.823
Fae.

13:48.036 --> 13:50.573
All will bow before me.

13:50.789 --> 13:52.905
I am your Queen.

14:01.967 --> 14:04.003
That was incredible.

14:05.303 --> 14:06.167
More.

14:06.388 --> 14:07.798
I need more.

14:08.015 --> 14:09.221
All of it.

14:09.433 --> 14:11.139
Everything, like you promised.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.091
Patience, sweet pea.

14:13.311 --> 14:16.303
In order to rule,
we need soldiers.

14:16.523 --> 14:17.854
An army.

14:18.066 --> 14:22.856
[JACK] Now it's time that
I fill them with my will.

14:23.071 --> 14:25.858
Followers, they're
all the same...

14:26.074 --> 14:28.656
What they need is direction.

14:28.869 --> 14:29.949
Yours.

14:30.162 --> 14:31.572
[JACK] Hmm.

14:53.143 --> 14:57.011
[singing] If you wanna know
if she loves you so,

14:57.230 --> 15:00.848
it's in her kiss,
that's where it is.

15:03.987 --> 15:06.228
[DYSON]
I know these officers.

15:06.448 --> 15:08.029
They were good men.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.622
[DYSON] How many do
you think there are?

15:14.831 --> 15:15.786
Bo couldn't have done this.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.034
It was Jack.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.286
It had to be him.

15:19.503 --> 15:20.083
Kenzi?

15:20.295 --> 15:23.253
[KENZI] What? What,
you think she did this?

15:23.465 --> 15:25.877
Kenzi, you saw the
blue light. We all did.

15:26.093 --> 15:27.924
This--This is Bo.
It has to be,

15:28.136 --> 15:29.512
she's the only one
who's capable.

15:29.721 --> 15:30.881
No, he-he made her.

15:31.098 --> 15:33.680
He's controlling the
Pyrippus inside of her.

15:33.892 --> 15:36.725
[MARK] Just like he made her
almost burn us to death?

15:38.939 --> 15:42.102
D, c'mon, c'mon, back me up.

15:42.317 --> 15:46.401
Kenz, open your eyes,
look around.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.524
[KENZI] Oh, what, what you
think she's evil now, too?

15:48.740 --> 15:50.981
Is that it?

15:51.201 --> 15:52.862
You know, I'd really expect
this from somebody else,

15:53.078 --> 15:55.114
but not from you.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.029
Guys!

15:59.876 --> 16:02.413
What if we lost her?

16:02.629 --> 16:06.417
[whimpering]

16:06.633 --> 16:07.998
Then we'll find her again.

16:08.218 --> 16:10.300
Kenz, we'll find her.

16:10.512 --> 16:11.797
We're not giving up.

16:12.013 --> 16:14.425
[LAUREN]
And nobody ever will.

16:14.641 --> 16:17.348
We will save Tamsin.
We will save Bo.

16:26.278 --> 16:28.860
God, please let there
be a Bo to save...

16:29.156 --> 16:31.192
[JACK]
Something is not right.

16:31.408 --> 16:34.491
There is still free
will in the territory.

16:34.703 --> 16:36.614
That's impossible.

16:36.830 --> 16:38.115
I fed off of everyone.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.868
If you had, my steed
would be complete.

16:41.084 --> 16:43.541
Who is still alive?

16:46.548 --> 16:49.005
My former allies.

16:49.217 --> 16:50.047
How?

16:50.260 --> 16:51.466
The horseshoe.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.964
Forged for me by the Ancients.

16:54.181 --> 16:56.012
That's what Zee was up to.

16:56.224 --> 16:59.307
She knew it'd
be used against me.

16:59.519 --> 17:00.383
Forgive me, Father.

17:00.604 --> 17:03.721
[BO] It was before I had
accepted my true destiny.

17:05.609 --> 17:06.473
Find them.

17:06.693 --> 17:09.025
Take it back.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.777
I will devour them.

17:14.993 --> 17:18.827
Hell on Earth, baby.
Make it happen.

17:23.251 --> 17:25.207
Guardians of the city.

17:25.420 --> 17:26.921
Rise.

17:31.259 --> 17:32.999
[DYSON]
Kenz, come here.

17:35.513 --> 17:36.263
[LAUREN]
I think I just peed.

17:36.473 --> 17:37.508
[KENZI] Y'see?

17:37.724 --> 17:39.009
[LAUREN] Yeah.
Dyson, what is this?

17:39.226 --> 17:40.807
How many syringes you
got in that thing?

17:41.019 --> 17:42.134
[LAUREN]
Not nearly enough.

17:42.354 --> 17:43.764
[VEX] Here's one for ya;
how many stiffs does it take

17:43.980 --> 17:46.392
to destroy a motorized caravan
and all its inhabitants?

17:46.608 --> 17:48.314
Depends.
Do proposed inhabitants

17:48.526 --> 17:50.858
happen to have
a life-saving horseshoe?

17:57.911 --> 18:00.493
[KENZI] I am so marrying
this thing when we're done.

18:01.081 --> 18:03.868
[screaming]

18:04.084 --> 18:05.290
[DYSON]
Go, go, go, go!

18:11.925 --> 18:13.665
[POLICE OFFICER] We pledge
our servitude to Hades,

18:13.885 --> 18:15.045
the Dark Lord.

18:15.262 --> 18:16.877
Surrender, or be terminated.

18:17.097 --> 18:19.338
[DYSON] This is how he planned
to bring hell on Earth.

18:19.557 --> 18:21.058
Not by raising souls
from Tartarus but by--

18:21.268 --> 18:22.883
No, by raising them here.

18:23.103 --> 18:24.718
But first, he needed
to drain them.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.053
Enter Bo's Chi suck.

18:26.273 --> 18:28.138
Hey, how 'bout we talk
about this over tea,

18:28.358 --> 18:30.349
when we're not
being shot at, eh?

18:30.568 --> 18:32.399
Tamsin.

18:33.488 --> 18:34.898
[TAMSIN] I knew you guys
didn't like me on the force,

18:35.115 --> 18:37.527
but this is a little extreme,
don't ya think?

18:37.742 --> 18:39.152
Your shift's up.

18:47.419 --> 18:48.283
What's up motherfae-ers.

18:48.503 --> 18:50.084
Your Doubt overcame Hades.

18:50.297 --> 18:52.629
Well, she is
carrying his child.

18:52.841 --> 18:53.876
You're Doubting for two.

18:54.092 --> 18:55.172
Where's Bo?

18:55.385 --> 18:56.420
[KENZI]
She went Pyrippus.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.046
No, she didn't.

18:58.263 --> 18:59.343
She kissed me--

18:59.556 --> 19:00.841
Oh, well, if she kissed you.

19:01.057 --> 19:03.924
To put the key in my mouth,
to save me, to help me escape.

19:04.144 --> 19:04.758
[KENZI]
A signature move

19:04.978 --> 19:06.309
she learned from me
in Hecuba prison.

19:06.521 --> 19:07.931
[LAUREN] Did she
give you the key before

19:08.148 --> 19:09.638
or after she fed off the city?

19:09.858 --> 19:11.268
[crash]

19:16.323 --> 19:17.028
[LAUREN]
Bo?

19:17.240 --> 19:20.698
[DYSON]
Bo! Bo, come down.

19:26.458 --> 19:28.289
No, Kenzi, I'll handle this.

19:28.501 --> 19:31.334
[KENZI] No, look I'm the only
one that can bring her back.

19:31.546 --> 19:33.537
I'm her heart, remember?

19:42.557 --> 19:45.219
[KENZI]
Bobes.

19:45.435 --> 19:47.050
Bobo?

19:47.270 --> 19:50.057
Boom boom-Bo.

19:50.273 --> 19:51.558
Hey, it's me.

19:51.775 --> 19:53.481
It's Kenzi. K-Star.

19:53.693 --> 19:57.060
Clog-the-drain-with
-a-hair-ball- Malikov.

19:57.280 --> 20:01.774
Look, we've been through
all this before, right?

20:01.993 --> 20:03.824
Djieiene spiders, Kitsunes...

20:04.037 --> 20:06.153
Even Tamsin went
Jack-Nicholson-evil.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.830
[KENZI]
But we always come back.

20:09.042 --> 20:10.202
Because we've got back.

20:10.418 --> 20:11.794
And this Kenzi-conda
don't want none

20:12.003 --> 20:13.994
unless you got buns, hun.

20:16.674 --> 20:20.041
Look, I left, I know,
and I'm sorry.

20:20.261 --> 20:23.424
But you were with me every
second that I was away,

20:23.640 --> 20:25.847
and that is
never gonna change.

20:26.059 --> 20:28.801
Because you're my sister
from another mister.

20:29.020 --> 20:31.397
Until the end. So please,

20:31.606 --> 20:33.722
please come back to me.

20:40.281 --> 20:43.193
So what, your eyes are
glowing a shade of hell.

20:43.410 --> 20:46.322
I know that it's not you.

20:46.538 --> 20:48.153
[KENZI] lt's him.

20:48.373 --> 20:51.365
So, please come back
to fight him with us.

20:51.584 --> 20:55.076
Because, we need you.

20:55.296 --> 20:57.582
I need you.

21:01.010 --> 21:03.217
Kenzi?

21:03.430 --> 21:04.795
Yes.

21:05.014 --> 21:06.003
Yes, girl.

21:06.224 --> 21:07.509
Oh.

21:15.859 --> 21:18.145
Ow, ow, Bo.

21:18.361 --> 21:20.818
Y-You're hurting me.

21:24.534 --> 21:26.900
This is mine.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.530
[KENZI gasps]

22:04.407 --> 22:07.695
[DYSON gasping]

22:43.071 --> 22:44.561
Oh my god!

22:50.370 --> 22:53.578
Oh god... Oh god,
what have I done?

22:54.666 --> 22:58.079
Bo? Is that you?

23:02.340 --> 23:03.830
How could I
let this happen?

23:04.050 --> 23:04.550
Bo, it's okay.

23:04.759 --> 23:05.919
No, I don't want sympathy.

23:06.135 --> 23:07.420
I wanna fix this.

23:07.637 --> 23:10.470
[BO] He broke me,
he broke my spirit.

23:10.682 --> 23:13.344
He showed me who I really am.

23:13.560 --> 23:14.891
A killer.

23:15.103 --> 23:16.218
[BO] He wants to
use me to feed

23:16.437 --> 23:19.179
so he can build his Dark Army.

23:19.399 --> 23:21.014
[LAUREN]
Yeah, well how do we stop him?

23:21.234 --> 23:23.725
There's only one way.

23:23.945 --> 23:25.526
I go Pyrippus on him.

23:25.738 --> 23:28.650
Don't you mean Dark Queen?

23:28.866 --> 23:29.855
They're one and the same.

23:30.076 --> 23:31.941
And they're getting
stronger by the minute.

23:32.161 --> 23:34.243
The only problem is,
I can't control it.

23:34.455 --> 23:36.116
I can't risk
hurting people again.

23:36.332 --> 23:37.412
I can't risk hurting
you guys again.

23:37.625 --> 23:39.331
Bo, you've tapped
into it before.

23:39.544 --> 23:40.499
Without him.

23:40.712 --> 23:43.203
After your Dawning,
with the Lich. You saved us!

23:43.423 --> 23:44.412
Look, Dyson's right.

23:44.632 --> 23:45.496
You controlled it.

23:45.717 --> 23:47.332
[BO] No, I didn't.
It just happened.

23:47.552 --> 23:48.758
Because you're evil!

23:48.970 --> 23:50.255
Not helping.

23:50.471 --> 23:51.051
You know what, let her.

23:51.264 --> 23:53.095
She's actually pretty
good at this.

23:53.308 --> 23:54.764
You're evil.

23:54.976 --> 23:56.216
But you're also good.

23:56.436 --> 23:59.519
[TAMSIN] We all have both
inside of us, good and evil.

23:59.731 --> 24:02.438
And if he created a monster,
let's use it against him.

24:02.650 --> 24:04.026
I don't know how!

24:04.235 --> 24:07.477
Bo. Remember when
we first met?

24:07.697 --> 24:09.062
Did you ever think then

24:09.282 --> 24:11.364
that you could
control your ability.

24:11.576 --> 24:13.157
No, not in a million years.

24:13.369 --> 24:14.654
But you did.

24:14.871 --> 24:16.111
I was there.

24:16.331 --> 24:18.322
And I will be there when
you learn to control it now.

24:18.541 --> 24:20.657
[DYSON]
I will always be there.

24:22.587 --> 24:26.455
[BO] My mom wasn't able to
suck the Dark Lord's Chi.

24:26.674 --> 24:27.663
[BO] How can I fight him?

24:27.884 --> 24:30.341
Why didn't you kill us?

24:30.553 --> 24:32.418
Hmm, what made you come back?

24:32.639 --> 24:34.220
All of you.

24:34.432 --> 24:37.549
I remember how
each of you taste.

24:37.769 --> 24:39.259
Your love brought me back.

24:39.479 --> 24:40.514
You guys are my family.

24:40.730 --> 24:42.345
[BO] And I love
you all very much.

24:42.565 --> 24:43.520
[VEX] Woah!
[tires screech]

24:44.067 --> 24:45.307
Bloody hell!

24:46.361 --> 24:47.942
[MARK]
The Elders.

24:49.530 --> 24:51.395
And I don't think
they're here to help.

24:51.616 --> 24:52.981
Twelve of the most
powerful Fae.

24:53.201 --> 24:54.441
And it's down
to a fist fight.

24:54.661 --> 24:55.650
[water dripping]
[TAMSIN gasps]

24:55.870 --> 24:57.485
Okay, that is not pee.

24:57.705 --> 24:59.491
[LAUREN]
Tamsin, your water broke.

24:59.707 --> 25:03.040
It's a good thing we've
got a doctor on board.

25:03.252 --> 25:04.753
[30}
Lauren, Kenzi--

25:04.962 --> 25:06.042
you guys stay in here
and deliver this baby.

25:08.633 --> 25:10.919
no Elders get near
this camper.

25:11.135 --> 25:12.796
Remember, nobody dies.

25:13.012 --> 25:15.253
They're under Hades control.

25:17.100 --> 25:18.886
I've got Big Bad Dad.

25:23.231 --> 25:26.473
How many of these Elders do you
think you can mesmer at once?

25:26.693 --> 25:28.900
We're about to find out.

25:30.363 --> 25:31.899
[DYSON growling]

25:33.366 --> 25:34.116
It hurts!

25:34.325 --> 25:35.656
You're tellin' me!

25:36.577 --> 25:38.442
I feel like I'm
being torn in half!

25:38.663 --> 25:40.449
[LAUREN] Tamsin, I need
you to breathe, okay?

25:40.665 --> 25:43.657
Just in and out. In and out.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.161
[LAUREN]
Kenzi, I need blankets.

25:45.378 --> 25:46.584
Okay! Okay!

25:46.796 --> 25:47.546
[KENZI] One second! One second.

25:47.755 --> 25:49.040
I'll be right back,
I'll be right back.

25:49.257 --> 25:50.292
Tamsin, I'm right here.

25:50.508 --> 25:52.920
I'm right here!
I'm right here, okay!

25:53.136 --> 25:55.878
Kenzi! It's... so... it--

25:56.097 --> 25:59.339
[screaming]

25:59.559 --> 26:01.891
Okay, okay, okay!
Look at me!

26:02.103 --> 26:03.559
[KENZI] Remember when
we took yoga at the Y?

26:03.771 --> 26:04.681
--[TAMS|N] No!
--[KENZI] Yes you do!

26:04.897 --> 26:06.478
Y-You gotta, you gotta
Pranayama that shit, okay?

26:06.691 --> 26:09.023
[TAMSIN]
In out, in out, in out.

26:09.235 --> 26:11.567
[screams]

26:11.779 --> 26:13.735
Namaste!

26:16.868 --> 26:19.280
[BO] Isolate me
from my friends...

26:19.495 --> 26:22.032
Break me up with my girlfriend.

26:22.248 --> 26:23.954
Kill Aife...

26:24.167 --> 26:25.657
Kill Trick.

26:26.711 --> 26:30.078
[BO] Try all you will,
you will not break me.

26:30.298 --> 26:32.459
That is sweet, but...

26:32.675 --> 26:34.506
I'm not here for you.

26:35.928 --> 26:39.466
Why do you think I let
you keep Tamsin alive?

26:39.682 --> 26:40.842
I'm here for my baby.

26:41.058 --> 26:43.515
Then you'll have to
get through me first.

26:43.728 --> 26:47.141
As long as I'm around,
I'm the favorite child.

26:47.356 --> 26:50.439
Is that a fact?

26:50.651 --> 26:52.607
Time for our first
Father-Daughter dance.

26:52.820 --> 26:53.650
[chuckles]

26:53.863 --> 26:54.898
You wanna fight, Bo?

26:55.114 --> 26:59.528
I'll give you one but,
you'll lose.

27:09.921 --> 27:10.535
The child cometh.

27:10.755 --> 27:11.744
I can smell it!

27:11.964 --> 27:12.828
Give it to us.

27:13.049 --> 27:14.414
It belongs to Hades.

27:14.634 --> 27:17.467
Okay, okay, you're doing good.
You're doing good!

27:17.678 --> 27:19.805
I should be out there
fighting. I'm a warrior.

27:20.014 --> 27:22.380
Hey, you listen to me,
what you are about

27:22.600 --> 27:25.683
to do is brave, Tamsin.
Possibly the bravest.

27:28.689 --> 27:29.895
'Kay, this? This right here--

27:30.107 --> 27:32.439
This is what it means
to be a warrior, okay?

27:32.652 --> 27:33.562
[KENZI]
You got this girl.

27:33.778 --> 27:35.484
[TAMSIN yelling]

27:35.696 --> 27:38.153
Okay. Tamsin, Tamsin,
it's time to push.

27:38.366 --> 27:39.947
Okay, come on.

27:43.830 --> 27:45.741
Okay, just got
Sailor Moon out there.

27:45.957 --> 27:47.743
Why, what's happening?

27:47.959 --> 27:50.416
Bo's giving the
best HJ of her life!

27:52.338 --> 27:55.705
[JACK] You're dying, Bo.
I'm killing you.

27:55.925 --> 27:59.167
You forced my hand.

27:59.971 --> 28:02.838
All because you wouldn't
accept what you truly are...

28:03.057 --> 28:04.046
Evil.

28:04.267 --> 28:06.849
You're right. I am evil,

28:07.061 --> 28:10.144
but I am also good.
Everyone has both!

28:10.356 --> 28:13.769
Except for you. That is
why you chose Tartarus.

28:13.985 --> 28:16.021
It's empty. It's hollow.

28:16.237 --> 28:18.603
You were created in
the image of Hades.

28:18.823 --> 28:20.438
We are the same.

28:20.658 --> 28:22.068
You may have created me,

28:22.285 --> 28:24.196
but you never gave
a shit about me.

28:24.412 --> 28:26.368
And that's where we differ.

28:26.581 --> 28:29.914
See, unlike you, I care.

28:30.126 --> 28:31.912
[BC]
I am Trick's blood too.

28:32.128 --> 28:33.868
And his love
makes me stronger

28:34.088 --> 28:36.921
than the evil
that consumes you.

28:38.342 --> 28:41.084
You will never use me.

28:41.304 --> 28:44.296
You will never control me.

28:45.850 --> 28:49.889
I will live the life
that I choose.

28:53.816 --> 28:55.727
I love you, Dad.

28:55.943 --> 28:57.934
[BO] And I'm gonna
give it all to you.

28:58.154 --> 29:00.611
Until the day you die.

29:00.823 --> 29:02.654
No.

29:29.477 --> 29:39.478
[music plays]

30:38.087 --> 30:39.076
[baby cries]

30:39.296 --> 30:40.832
[LAUREN]
It's a girl.

30:44.385 --> 30:46.421
Hi.

30:47.555 --> 30:50.467
I'm your mama.

31:00.401 --> 31:10.402
[music continues]

31:13.122 --> 31:14.703
You were pretty amazing.

31:14.915 --> 31:15.825
[chuckles]

31:16.042 --> 31:18.203
Yeah, I suppose I was,
wasn't I.

31:18.419 --> 31:20.250
[BOTH chuckle]

31:20.463 --> 31:22.454
Hey, you weren't
too bad yourself.

31:24.175 --> 31:27.383
Hey. I heard you shifted.

31:27.595 --> 31:29.085
Yeah.

31:29.305 --> 31:33.298
So, uh, have you chosen?

31:33.517 --> 31:36.930
You know--Lig ht, Dark?

31:37.146 --> 31:41.014
No. I don't
think I ever will.

31:41.734 --> 31:44.396
Hah. Hmm.

31:44.612 --> 31:47.194
I have made one choice though.

32:14.975 --> 32:16.590
Ten fingers. Ten toes.

32:16.811 --> 32:18.551
Healthy through and through.

32:18.771 --> 32:20.978
Same can't be said for Tamsin.

32:23.025 --> 32:24.140
[LAUREN]
Her vitals are dropping.

32:24.360 --> 32:26.100
She's fighting
just to stay alive.

32:32.993 --> 32:35.370
All Valkyries die
in childbirth.

32:48.092 --> 32:50.754

to say goodbye to you.

No.

33:08.237 --> 33:10.353
It's my time.

33:11.323 --> 33:13.735
Tamsin...

33:13.951 --> 33:16.863
Please, stay here.

33:17.079 --> 33:19.786
I will be here.

33:20.666 --> 33:22.167
Through my daughter.

33:25.087 --> 33:27.499
She's my legacy, Bo.

33:34.221 --> 33:36.837
You look after her
for me, okay?

33:38.100 --> 33:43.390
I promise that I will do
everything to protect her.

33:48.152 --> 33:50.518
[TAMSIN]
Don't cry for me.

33:52.656 --> 33:56.774
For Valkyries, on our last life,
it's not called dying...

33:58.537 --> 34:00.914
It's called rising.

34:07.463 --> 34:09.078
Dagny.

35:08.524 --> 35:10.480
You have your mama's eyes.

35:12.486 --> 35:15.398
She was the strongest
person that I ever met.

35:17.533 --> 35:19.569
[BO] You're my sister.

35:19.785 --> 35:22.242
And I have to protect you.

35:22.454 --> 35:28.450
But right now,
I have work to do.

35:28.669 --> 35:30.876
Dangerous work.

35:32.881 --> 35:37.591
And that's why this
is for the best, okay?

35:37.803 --> 35:41.887
Even though I can't
take care of you right now,

35:42.099 --> 35:46.058
I'll watch over you.

35:46.270 --> 35:48.261
We all will.

35:49.356 --> 35:51.312

35:57.448 --> 36:01.282

grow up a lost girl.

36:21.847 --> 36:24.304
Take care of her.

36:24.516 --> 36:27.428
And take care of yourself.

36:27.644 --> 36:30.886
You know, I never
lost faith in you.

[KENZI] Even when I
almost did, I-I didn't.

36:37.154 --> 36:39.270
I love you.

You're my heart, Kenzi.

Yeah.

Tearful goodbyes
are so last season.

37:34.461 --> 37:37.294
Future: completely uncertain.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.749
Not completely.

37:44.471 --> 37:47.178
[LAUREN]
I, human, Lauren Lewis,

37:47.391 --> 37:50.724
wanna spend the rest
of my life with you,

37:50.936 --> 37:54.053
Succubus, Bo Dennis.

37:55.441 --> 37:57.978
I always thought that
because of who I am,

37:58.193 --> 38:01.151
I couldn't have
a relationship.

38:01.363 --> 38:03.979
Let alone with a human.

38:05.909 --> 38:09.618
And then I met you...

38:09.830 --> 38:13.322
And you broke my heart.

38:13.542 --> 38:15.203
A mistake that I made twice.

38:15.419 --> 38:18.786
[LAUREN] And one that I
would never make again.

38:19.006 --> 38:21.247
Lauren, we are messy.

38:21.467 --> 38:23.799
We're complicated.
That hasn't changed.

38:24.011 --> 38:27.253
[laughs] I know.

38:27.473 --> 38:29.964
And I hope that it never does.

38:32.811 --> 38:35.427
Do you think that
we can do this?

38:40.235 --> 38:42.487
I do.

38:42.696 --> 38:44.857
[LAUREN exhales]

38:59.463 --> 39:01.294
[DYSON]
Easy, killer.

39:02.382 --> 39:03.963
Kenzi's obeying
the speed limit.

39:04.176 --> 39:05.757
No texting and driving.

39:05.969 --> 39:08.051
A little singing and eating...

39:08.263 --> 39:09.594
They're safe.

39:09.806 --> 39:12.764
Well, she is in
very good hands.

39:12.976 --> 39:14.841
The best.

39:15.938 --> 39:20.147
So, are you ever gonna tell
her who her father really was?

39:20.359 --> 39:22.771
You mean who he still is?

39:24.863 --> 39:27.320
[30}
Just because he's gone...

39:30.118 --> 39:35.408
[BO] ...doesn't mean
he's not still out there.

39:35.624 --> 39:37.615
Waiting...

39:37.834 --> 39:40.496
Watching...

39:48.178 --> 39:50.169
[BO] Evil never dies.

40:13.579 --> 40:15.285
What's wrong?

40:15.497 --> 40:17.078
Nothing.

40:18.292 --> 40:19.782
You sure?

40:20.752 --> 40:22.333
[GIRLFRIEND]
We don't have to do this, okay?

40:22.546 --> 40:27.540
No. No, it's okay.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.169
I want to.

40:38.812 --> 40:40.177
What the hell?

40:42.649 --> 40:44.230
[knocking]

40:44.443 --> 40:46.354
Sorry to break up the party.

40:46.570 --> 40:48.686
You're gonna have
to come with me.

41:04.963 --> 41:08.876
She has no idea what
she's in for, does she?

41:09.092 --> 41:10.957
[MARK chuckles]

41:13.138 --> 41:14.878
Beer me.

41:15.098 --> 41:16.634
Please?

41:18.560 --> 41:20.300
You're underage.

41:22.356 --> 41:25.143
But, what you can do...

41:25.359 --> 41:27.395
is sign this.

41:28.445 --> 41:29.525
Right.

41:29.738 --> 41:31.569
The Ledger.

41:31.782 --> 41:33.568
So, what's next?

41:33.784 --> 41:35.365
Choose if I'm Light or Dark.

41:35.577 --> 41:38.034
Not in this colony.

41:38.246 --> 41:43.832
We're fighting to
change some old rules.

41:47.339 --> 41:50.706
So that one day, no Fae
will ever have to choose.

41:50.926 --> 41:53.008
Anywhere.

41:53.220 --> 41:54.505
Now that you've hit Fae puberty

41:54.721 --> 41:57.098
I'll do another full work up.

41:57.891 --> 41:59.347
She's still aging
into adulthood

41:59.559 --> 42:00.890
at an accelerated rate.

42:01.103 --> 42:03.685
[LAUREN]
Just like her mom.

42:03.897 --> 42:06.058
You probably
don't remember us,

42:06.274 --> 42:07.855
but we have all been
watching out for you

42:08.068 --> 42:10.309
since you were little.

42:10.529 --> 42:13.111
Kenzi told me
this day would come.

42:15.367 --> 42:17.574
The mesmer.

42:17.786 --> 42:19.492
The wolf.

42:19.705 --> 42:20.865
The rookie.

42:21.081 --> 42:22.412
[GIRL] The doctor.

42:22.624 --> 42:24.580
Wait. There's one missing...

42:24.793 --> 42:26.533
Hi Dagny.

42:27.838 --> 42:29.669
God you're beautiful.

42:31.758 --> 42:34.340
Famous words to a succubus.

42:34.553 --> 42:37.169
The last thing your mother
said to me was your name.

42:37.389 --> 42:39.596
[BO] It means new day.

42:40.934 --> 42:42.435
[BO] It's been hard
watching my little sister

42:42.644 --> 42:44.555
grow up from a distance.

42:44.771 --> 42:47.228
But Kenzi kept you
safe among humans.

42:49.025 --> 42:51.402
Until now.

42:55.782 --> 42:56.988
What is this?

42:57.200 --> 42:59.191
Evil.

43:00.996 --> 43:04.830
I don't know how,
and I don't know when...

43:05.041 --> 43:07.123
but it's coming for you.

43:08.462 --> 43:10.794
What happens then?

43:13.383 --> 43:14.919
We'll be ready.
