Dear Jamie,
when we're together,

00:45.612 --> 00:48.911
I feel like we're
not in high school,

00:48.982 --> 00:52.179
but in our own little
Chris-andJamie world.

00:52.252 --> 00:54.584
Whether we're watching
"Party of Five"

00:54.654 --> 00:57.122
or practicing our cheers,

00:57.190 --> 01:00.318
I feel like I can
just be myself.

01:00.393 --> 01:04.659
Jamie, we've been friends
for a really long time,

01:04.730 --> 01:06.665
but I want to be
more than that.

01:06.733 --> 01:09.258
Oops! I don't think so.

01:11.704 --> 01:13.729
Hoping to be
your boyfriend.

01:13.807 --> 01:15.741
Sincerely, Chris Brander.

01:15.809 --> 01:17.470
BFF!

01:17.544 --> 01:20.342
* I swear *

01:20.413 --> 01:25.817
* By the moon and the stars
in the skies *

01:25.885 --> 01:28.752
* I'll be there,
yeah *

01:28.822 --> 01:31.723
* And I swear *

01:31.791 --> 01:37.195
* Like a shadow
that's by your side *

01:37.263 --> 01:41.199
* I'll be there *

01:41.267 --> 01:43.394
* For better or worse... *

01:43.470 --> 01:46.337
- Raise your hand if your brother's a homo!
- * Till death do us part... *

01:46.406 --> 01:49.069
- Get out of my room!
- Mom!

01:49.142 --> 01:52.373
Stupid! Anybody ever hear
of privacy around here?!

01:52.445 --> 01:55.642
- * I swear *
- You're the homo.

02:03.723 --> 02:05.315
Jamie!

02:05.391 --> 02:07.120
Yeah, I signed
your yearbook.

02:07.193 --> 02:09.661
Oh, you feel the same
way about me?

02:09.729 --> 02:11.356
Oh, you want a kiss?

02:13.299 --> 02:15.733
Jamie,
I signed your yearbook.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.793
Jamie,
I'm opening your gate.

02:35.221 --> 02:37.018
What's up, guys?

02:37.090 --> 02:39.024
- Class of '95.
- Mm-mm.

02:39.092 --> 02:42.425
Hey, what's up, Leon, Trevor?
Great season. Great.

02:45.932 --> 02:47.866
I love you.

02:47.934 --> 02:50.801
- Hey, guys.
- Chris Brander, ladies and gentlemen!

02:50.870 --> 02:52.963
- Happy graduation, Chris.
- What's going on?

02:53.039 --> 02:54.939
I thought it was supposed to be
just the four of us.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.737
The Palaminos decided
to throw Jamie

02:56.809 --> 02:59.334
- a surprise graduation party.
- Oh, that's just great!

02:59.412 --> 03:02.006
- Tonight's the night.
- Where is she?

03:02.081 --> 03:04.879
I think I saw her go in the garage
with the football team.

03:06.085 --> 03:08.747
- Sweet.
- Hey. No fear, Chris, huh? This is your

03:08.821 --> 03:11.585
- chance to get out of the "friend zone."
- Yeah.

03:11.658 --> 03:13.649
- Huh?
- Okay.

03:17.497 --> 03:19.362
*... for hip hop
this is hip hop for today *

03:19.432 --> 03:20.990
* I give props to hip hop,
so hip hop hooray... *

03:21.134 --> 03:23.568
Jamie.

03:23.636 --> 03:26.662
- Chris!
- Yay!

03:26.739 --> 03:30.231
You came, finally!
I'm so happy.

03:30.310 --> 03:33.473
Oh, come on,
come on!

03:41.187 --> 03:43.553
Oh my God,
we graduated!

03:43.623 --> 03:45.250
Whoo!

03:47.393 --> 03:48.519
- God.
- Yeah.

03:48.595 --> 03:50.961
What's up?

03:51.030 --> 03:54.022
There's something I've been
meaning to say to you.

03:54.100 --> 03:56.227
Jamie!
There you are.

03:56.302 --> 03:58.862
- Hey, Tim.
- Shut up, chubs.

03:58.938 --> 04:00.701
Funny guy!

04:00.773 --> 04:03.606
Jamie...

04:03.676 --> 04:06.907
- will you sign my yearbook, please?
- Can I do it later, Tim?

04:06.980 --> 04:09.778
Can I do you later?

04:13.086 --> 04:14.713
I need a beer!

04:14.787 --> 04:17.187
I can't believe...

04:17.257 --> 04:18.781
- I went out with him.
- You went out with him.

04:18.858 --> 04:21.622
Jinx! 1-2-34-5-6-7, can't say
a thing till I say...

04:27.700 --> 04:30.260
Come in.

04:32.472 --> 04:35.202
- Oh, hi. Hi, Jamie.
- Hey, Dusty.

04:36.409 --> 04:38.570
I was hoping
I'd find you here.

04:38.645 --> 04:40.340
I didn't know
you played guitar.

04:40.413 --> 04:42.313
L-I r-really...

04:42.382 --> 04:45.283
- I really want to be a famous musician.
- Huh.

04:45.351 --> 04:48.184
And, um,
I wrote you a song.

04:48.254 --> 04:51.587
He wrote me a song!
That's so cute.

04:51.658 --> 04:53.285
It's called
"Jamie Smiles."

04:53.359 --> 04:55.623
Aw.

04:58.798 --> 05:00.823
* When Jam... *

05:00.900 --> 05:02.333
Hold on.

05:05.705 --> 05:07.570
* When Jamie... *

05:09.442 --> 05:11.171
He's crazy.

05:11.244 --> 05:13.007
* When Jamie... *

05:13.079 --> 05:16.014
God damn it!
Come on, Dusty!

05:16.082 --> 05:19.609
Dusty, come here.

05:19.686 --> 05:21.745
Maybe you should come back
another time when you're...

05:21.821 --> 05:24.016
- Oh, no, I got it.
- You can come back

05:24.090 --> 05:26.024
and then play it
for us later, okay?

05:26.092 --> 05:28.117
- I really... I've got it. It's beautiful.
- Yeah.

05:28.194 --> 05:30.059
- It is.
- Bye, Dusty.

05:31.764 --> 05:33.459
Jesus.

05:33.533 --> 05:35.023
Yeah.

05:35.101 --> 05:37.194
Oh, I almost forgot.

05:37.270 --> 05:40.433
I got you a little
something right here.

05:40.506 --> 05:42.440
Okay. Now I know
it's a little dorky,

05:42.508 --> 05:44.442
but I had to do it.

05:44.510 --> 05:46.444
So look at it.

05:46.512 --> 05:48.446
Will you put it
on for me?

05:48.514 --> 05:50.311
- Now?
- Please, please? Put it on.

05:50.383 --> 05:52.874
- Okay. Quickly.
- Okay okay okay okay.

05:52.952 --> 05:54.681
- I think it's gonna fit.
- Yeah.

05:54.754 --> 05:56.881
- Let's see.
- Okay.

05:56.956 --> 05:58.821
- Here we go.
- Okay.

06:03.696 --> 06:05.425
It's a little snug.

06:05.498 --> 06:07.932
Oh my God,
isn't that so cute?

06:08.000 --> 06:09.934
"Shakes come and go,

06:10.002 --> 06:11.594
but friends are
furrr-ever!"

06:11.671 --> 06:13.764
That's adorable!
Let's go show my mom.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.831
She'll love it. Let's go
show her. Come on.

06:15.908 --> 06:17.808
- Let's not. No no. Come on.
- Chris, she's gonna love it!

06:17.877 --> 06:19.174
Just... just wait.

06:19.245 --> 06:22.237
- Just... we're busy!
- Chris, are you okay?

06:22.315 --> 06:24.681
Yes, I'm fine.
I just...

06:25.918 --> 06:27.647
I signed your yearbook.

06:28.688 --> 06:30.155
Um...

06:30.223 --> 06:32.851
read it...
please.

06:32.925 --> 06:34.119
Okay.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.756
Please, God.

06:40.833 --> 06:44.360
"Stud muffin, getting it on
in your love truck was hot!"

06:44.437 --> 06:46.769
- Oh!
- Wait! That's not what I wrote!

06:46.839 --> 06:48.807
This is Tim's yearbook.

06:50.309 --> 06:52.903
- Chris?
- Oh my God!

06:52.979 --> 06:55.345
Listen to this.
Listen to this.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.178
"When we're together,
I feel"...

06:57.250 --> 06:59.184
- Gimme!
- "Like we're not in high school, but we're

06:59.252 --> 07:01.914
- in our own Chris-andJamie little world."
- Tim... okay.

07:01.988 --> 07:04.047
Okay.

07:04.123 --> 07:06.421
- "You're my best friend..."
- Please, don't read that.

07:06.492 --> 07:08.426
"But I want to be
more than that"?

07:08.494 --> 07:09.927
Ooh!

07:09.996 --> 07:11.987
"Hoping to be
your boyfriend.

07:12.064 --> 07:15.556
Sincerely, Chris Brander,
BFF."

07:15.635 --> 07:18.763
It's a joke! That's a joke
between me and Jamie!

07:18.838 --> 07:20.635
Holy shit!
Check out his shirt!

07:28.681 --> 07:30.808
Aw, he's gonna cry.

07:30.883 --> 07:32.612
See ya!

07:33.786 --> 07:35.686
G'bye, fatty!

07:36.923 --> 07:38.447
Chris!

07:38.524 --> 07:40.890
Try a salad!

07:40.960 --> 07:42.894
- Chris!
- Leave me alone!

07:42.962 --> 07:45.123
Don't worry about it.
It happens to everybody.

07:45.198 --> 07:48.497
Chris! We need to talk
about what you wrote.

07:48.568 --> 07:50.502
Is that really
how you feel?

07:50.570 --> 07:53.061
I don't know.
Maybe. Why?

07:53.139 --> 07:56.040
Because that's the nicest thing
anyone's ever written me.

07:56.108 --> 07:58.235
It was?

07:58.311 --> 07:59.642
Yes.

07:59.712 --> 08:01.839
I love you, Chris...

08:04.917 --> 08:07.283
- like a brother.
- Hmm?

08:07.353 --> 08:11.187
- We're friends, right?
- For sure!

08:13.226 --> 08:15.160
Ah, you pussy!

08:15.228 --> 08:16.786
Shut up, Tim!

08:19.031 --> 08:21.693
Don't you people have anything
better to do?!

08:21.767 --> 08:23.758
God! Just leave
him alone!

08:25.571 --> 08:27.766
You jerks!

08:27.840 --> 08:29.603
- I'll show you!
- Ooh!

08:29.675 --> 08:32.006
I'll show all of you!

08:32.078 --> 08:34.979
This town
is full of losers

08:35.047 --> 08:36.741
and I'm pulling
out to win!

08:36.816 --> 08:38.977
Chris!
Chris, come back!

08:39.051 --> 08:42.452
- My name is Chris Brander!
- Chris, let's talk!

08:42.522 --> 08:45.013
You remember that name!
'Cause I'm gonna be somebody!

09:10.950 --> 09:12.577
I don't know what to say.

09:12.652 --> 09:15.018
I mean,
the sex is good,

09:15.087 --> 09:16.714
but I'm a person too.

09:16.789 --> 09:18.984
I mean, I have
feelings and needs

09:19.058 --> 09:20.457
other than
just physical!

09:20.526 --> 09:23.586
Don't you have anything
to say for yourself?

09:24.964 --> 09:26.898
I think you've pretty much
said it all.

09:26.966 --> 09:29.901
You know what?
This just isn't working out.

09:29.969 --> 09:32.631
Have a great life,
'cause Athena's out!

09:35.474 --> 09:37.704
I don't know why you
just don't take me serious!

09:41.948 --> 09:43.882
Wow!

09:43.950 --> 09:45.884
I guess Athena's out.

09:47.119 --> 09:48.347
God, can you
believe that?

09:48.421 --> 09:50.355
I get dumped four days
before Christmas.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.357
- I saw.
- Yeah, and yet, you did nothing.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.086
Technically, that makes you
an accomplice.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.627
Guilty as charged.

09:55.695 --> 09:58.323
You know, in some cultures
they'd spank you for that.

09:58.397 --> 10:00.422
Oh, I love to travel.

10:01.734 --> 10:03.793
- Chris Brander.
- I'm Mandy.

10:03.869 --> 10:06.565
Of course you are. You know,
I know a song called "Mandy."

10:06.639 --> 10:08.573
Oh!

10:09.875 --> 10:11.604
He shoots, he scores.

10:14.914 --> 10:18.077
- Nice, nice!
- Yeah, Brander! Great job, Brander!

10:18.150 --> 10:21.381
You're the bad bunny.
No. No, that's you.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.684
You're the bad bunny.
Yeah.

10:23.756 --> 10:25.485
Okay, that's enough
out of you.

10:25.558 --> 10:27.583
Next time you call me,
you call me collect.

10:27.660 --> 10:29.594
Okay. Bye-bye.

10:29.662 --> 10:32.256
- So how'd it go last night?
- Home by 10:00.

10:32.331 --> 10:34.629
Pants off in front
of the computer by 10:01.

10:34.700 --> 10:37.134
Nice. What about Sheila?
Are you making any headway?

10:37.203 --> 10:39.137
We'll see. I'm taking her
to lunch today...

10:39.205 --> 10:41.298
Oh, whoa, whoa whoa.
Don't... don't do that.

10:41.374 --> 10:43.035
- Okay? Don't do lunch.
- Why?

10:43.109 --> 10:45.304
That's like the express lane
to the friend zone.

10:45.378 --> 10:47.642
What the hell's
the friend zone?

10:47.713 --> 10:49.874
See when a girl decides
that you're her friend,

10:49.949 --> 10:51.473
you're no longer
a dating option.

10:51.550 --> 10:54.041
You become a complete
non-sexual entity in her eyes,

10:54.120 --> 10:55.883
like her brother.
Or a lamp.

10:55.955 --> 10:57.479
I don't want
to be a lamp.

10:57.556 --> 10:59.683
Yeah. Well, then don't be
her friend, okay?

10:59.759 --> 11:02.887
Oh. Take that guy,
for example.

11:02.962 --> 11:04.987
- You mean that couple?
- No no no.

11:05.064 --> 11:07.658
No, I mean the guy that
wishes they were a couple.

11:07.733 --> 11:09.496
- What is your point?
- My point is...

11:09.568 --> 11:12.298
call Sheila, Ray.
Call her right now.

11:12.371 --> 11:14.202
Move your day date
to tonight.

11:14.273 --> 11:17.174
Play the entire thing aloof and no matter
what you do, kiss her at the end.

11:17.243 --> 11:20.542
- 'Cause friends don't kiss.
- All right. "Aloof."

11:20.613 --> 11:23.138
Hi.

11:26.719 --> 11:28.482
- Straight to voicemail.
- Ouch.

11:28.554 --> 11:31.182
Hope you're not too late.
You may already be girlfriends.

11:31.257 --> 11:34.590
- Really? How will I know?
- Look. It doesn't matter, okay?

11:34.660 --> 11:38.460
If you feel yourself
going there, walk away.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.226
Where'd you come up
with this theory?

11:40.299 --> 11:43.029
Some chick f'd me up
in high school bad.

11:43.102 --> 11:45.400
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

11:45.471 --> 11:46.961
Excuse you!

11:47.039 --> 11:48.631
I saw you flirting
with me out there.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.869
How could you do
that to your boyfriend?

11:50.943 --> 11:53.241
Who, him?
We're just friends.

11:55.948 --> 11:58.746
Oh, no no no, I never said that, Lindsay. I
wouldn't do that.

11:58.818 --> 12:00.877
No, I'm driving
through a tunnel.

12:00.953 --> 12:03.444
Okay. One second here.
Hey, Francine, you look great.

12:03.522 --> 12:06.889
- Thanks.
- That color really brings out your legs.

12:06.959 --> 12:09.951
Hey, I don't even know you.
Yeah. Ho-ho-ho.

12:10.029 --> 12:11.587
That's great.
Merry Christmas.

12:11.664 --> 12:13.859
I can still see it.
I can still... rub harder!

12:13.933 --> 12:15.525
Don't dab at it!
Rub it.

12:15.601 --> 12:17.762
Rub, rub it, rub it!

12:17.837 --> 12:19.998
Look, honestly, these pants
make me look fat?

12:20.072 --> 12:21.835
- Well...
- You're fired!

12:21.907 --> 12:23.772
- What?
- I'm kidding.

12:23.843 --> 12:26.368
Ho-ho-ho! Who's got
a Christmas present?

12:26.445 --> 12:28.003
I do.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.014
How you doing, boss?
Merry Christmas.

12:30.082 --> 12:32.016
- I look fat in these pants?
- Hell no.

12:32.084 --> 12:34.052
Excellent! So you're
seeing your family

12:34.120 --> 12:36.213
- for the holidays.
- Well, as a matter of fact...

12:36.288 --> 12:37.778
- Wait. You want anything?
- No.

12:37.857 --> 12:40.553
Go! Wait.

12:40.626 --> 12:42.526
- Family.
- Parents are separated.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.495
- Jersey's not my idea of a good time, so...
- Fabulous.

12:44.563 --> 12:46.292
- Check this out.
- Yeah. Great. Good.

12:46.365 --> 12:49.630
First up tonight, you've seen
her in the pages of magazines,

12:49.702 --> 12:51.693
and well, the opening
of practically anything,

12:51.771 --> 12:53.932
but what what you may not
know about this "it" girl...

12:54.006 --> 12:55.701
is her humanitarian side.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.333
Hey, everyone.
I'm Samantha James

12:57.409 --> 12:58.842
and I'm here
with Mr. Cluck Cluck

12:58.911 --> 13:00.879
and my new
best friend Wafoofi

13:00.946 --> 13:03.210
and we're part of a kick-ass
humanitarian effort

13:03.282 --> 13:05.944
to help promote vegetarianism
in third world countries,

13:06.018 --> 13:07.679
which is really really
important.

13:07.753 --> 13:10.722
Okay, and speaking of
really really important...

13:10.790 --> 13:13.350
I have some good news.

13:13.425 --> 13:15.154
I've been recording
for my new album

13:15.227 --> 13:17.252
which I hope to have out
early next...

13:18.731 --> 13:21.495
- I want that album.
- Hah! What?!

13:21.567 --> 13:22.966
- Samantha James?
- Yeah.

13:23.035 --> 13:25.060
No no no no. Listen to me
very carefully now.

13:25.137 --> 13:27.367
Samantha James
is a crazy person.

13:27.439 --> 13:29.532
Hey, you're the one that
used to diddle her, not me.

13:29.608 --> 13:32.668
It was one date!
And I ended up in the hospital.

13:32.745 --> 13:35.236
Have you seen this poster?
Huh? Have you seen...

13:35.314 --> 13:37.077
- this poster?
- Yeah, with the fruit.

13:37.149 --> 13:39.811
This is the hottest-selling
poster in the United States.

13:39.885 --> 13:41.876
People love her.
They love her!

13:41.954 --> 13:43.819
Oh, who loves her?

13:43.889 --> 13:46.380
MTV just got her a new
reality show next year.

13:46.458 --> 13:49.950
We time the CD release with the show,
we got a guaranteed hit

13:50.029 --> 13:51.462
plus free promotion.

13:51.530 --> 13:54.055
- She's recording over...
- I know where she's recording.

13:54.133 --> 13:57.330
Good. Good.
Make me happy.

13:57.403 --> 13:59.132
Go away.
Wait. Not you.

13:59.205 --> 14:01.036
Wait!

14:01.106 --> 14:04.075
You don't make me happy, I'm gonna
find somebody else to make me happy.

14:04.143 --> 14:06.543
Loud and clear. Yeah.
Clear as a bell.

14:06.612 --> 14:07.544
- Good.
- Okay.

14:07.613 --> 14:09.080
What are you
still doing here?

14:09.148 --> 14:10.342
Go!
Go get me lobster!

14:10.416 --> 14:12.077
Go! Run! Lobster!

14:12.151 --> 14:14.119
Run away! Run!
Daddy want a fish!

14:16.989 --> 14:19.355
* Uh, uh, uh *

14:19.425 --> 14:24.624
* Yeah, uh uh,
eins zwei drei vier! *

14:24.697 --> 14:27.393
* We might be
a world apart *

14:27.466 --> 14:29.593
* World apart *

14:29.668 --> 14:31.568
* But you're always
in my heart *

14:31.637 --> 14:33.628
* Always in my heart *

14:33.706 --> 14:36.573
- * When you look up at the stars *
- * Look up at the stars *

14:36.642 --> 14:39.805
- * Feel my love from afar *
- * Afar afar *

14:39.879 --> 14:43.679
- * Looking down like a shining star *
- * Shining star *

14:43.749 --> 14:47.412
- * Dancing free with my guitar *
- * My guitar *

14:47.486 --> 14:50.853
- * I don't know just where you are *
- * Where are you? *

14:50.923 --> 14:52.914
* Love from afar,
love from afar *

14:52.992 --> 14:57.292
* Feel my love... *

14:58.797 --> 15:01.766
Cut! Cut!

15:03.269 --> 15:06.295
Okay, Ron, which jokester
changed the key on me?

15:06.372 --> 15:08.067
No one, Samantha.

15:08.140 --> 15:10.574
It's been the same key
for the last 43 takes.

15:10.643 --> 15:14.204
Well, something's off then,
because I'm just not feeling it, okay?

15:14.280 --> 15:16.077
God, I need my guitar.

15:16.148 --> 15:18.810
- We need to mix the tracks separately.
- No!

15:18.884 --> 15:23.253
My lyrics say "dancing free
with my guitar," Ron.

15:23.322 --> 15:25.483
So, I'm gonna
be real, okay?

15:25.557 --> 15:27.923
I'm not gonna let you
and Hong Kong Phooey up there

15:27.993 --> 15:31.588
turn me into some poppy
bubblegum wannabe.

15:31.664 --> 15:33.632
Okay?
I need to transcend!

15:33.699 --> 15:35.599
Are you guys
even listening to me?

15:35.668 --> 15:38.068
* You guys are assholes,
you're assholes... *

15:38.137 --> 15:40.264
- Switch it off, guys.
- * Ron, you're an asshole *

15:40.339 --> 15:43.502
* You guys are assholes,
You're assholes. *

15:43.575 --> 15:45.440
She's all yours.

15:45.511 --> 15:47.775
Chris!

15:51.583 --> 15:54.245
Hey!

15:54.320 --> 15:57.687
I can't hear you, Samantha.
I can't hear you, Samantha.

15:58.724 --> 15:59.816
- Can't hear you.
- Oh.

15:59.892 --> 16:03.760
Oh, light bulb.
There you go.

16:06.865 --> 16:08.992
Oh my God,
I don't believe it!

16:09.068 --> 16:11.161
God, I've missed you.

16:11.236 --> 16:13.204
Oh... okay.

16:17.076 --> 16:19.909
Wait a minute. Are you here
because you miss me,

16:19.979 --> 16:22.777
or are you just here because your
boss wants to sign me?

16:24.483 --> 16:26.474
Both?

16:26.552 --> 16:29.350
That's cool.
Guess I missed you too.

16:30.556 --> 16:32.581
God, I want to lick
your skin off!

16:32.658 --> 16:34.717
- I prefer you didn't.
- But I want to.

16:34.793 --> 16:37.159
Don't.

16:38.931 --> 16:40.364
Ow!

16:40.432 --> 16:43.026
Ooh, you're gonna get it.
You're gonna get it, baby.

16:43.102 --> 16:46.435
- I don't want it.
- Bad kitty. Meow, meow.

16:46.505 --> 16:48.598
- Okay.
- Oh! Listen, what're you doing

16:48.674 --> 16:51.040
- over the holidays?
- I'm going to Santa Barbara...

16:51.110 --> 16:52.338
'Cause Paris is throwing
a Christmas bash in Paris.

16:52.411 --> 16:53.878
Okay, Paris isn't
gonna work for...

16:53.946 --> 16:56.005
I'm gonna call my assistant
and we're gonna go tonight.

16:56.081 --> 16:58.413
We can work and play.
Mreow.

16:58.484 --> 17:00.782
Oh my God! I just wrote a new song.
You have to hear it!

17:04.455 --> 17:06.219
This one's called
"Forgiveness."

17:06.290 --> 17:08.589
Ahem.

17:13.499 --> 17:15.200
* Forgiveness *

17:15.200 --> 17:17.862
* Forgiveness *

17:17.935 --> 17:21.030
* Is more than
saying sorry *

17:25.644 --> 17:28.407
* To forgive is divine *

17:28.480 --> 17:31.540
* So let's have
a glass of wine *

17:31.617 --> 17:34.381
* And have makeup sex *

17:34.453 --> 17:35.920
* Until the end of *

17:35.988 --> 17:39.048
* Time time time time *

17:39.124 --> 17:42.992
* Time *

17:43.062 --> 17:44.791
* Time. *

17:46.632 --> 17:48.896
So what did you
you think?

17:48.967 --> 17:51.060
Ah!

17:51.136 --> 17:53.832
I mean, my God!

17:53.906 --> 17:55.999
Oh my God,
you're sweet.

17:57.309 --> 17:59.834
- What is that?
- This is a taser gun.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.312
My publicist gave it to me
to ward off stalkers.

18:02.381 --> 18:04.611
Bam!
Ha ha ha!

18:04.683 --> 18:08.119
Ooh, ahi tuna.

18:08.187 --> 18:10.985
- You want some? Yummy yummy.
- I'll pass.

18:11.056 --> 18:13.388
Ahi!

18:13.459 --> 18:16.223
Oh, I'm so glad
KC got us back together.

18:16.295 --> 18:18.058
Yeah, you're awful.

18:18.130 --> 18:20.690
Hey, I have a great idea.

18:20.766 --> 18:23.030
What if on our way to Paris
we stop off in Ireland

18:23.102 --> 18:24.933
and find out
where U2 lives?

18:25.003 --> 18:27.870
What if we got someone
like Bono to sing backup?

18:27.940 --> 18:29.999
I'd be all...
* Forgiveness is the way, *

18:30.075 --> 18:33.272
and he'd go, * Forgiveness every day *
only all Bono-y.

18:33.345 --> 18:35.336
Wouldn't that
be amazing?

18:35.414 --> 18:38.212
Ah! What if I added
more vibrato?

18:38.283 --> 18:41.252
* Forgiveness *

18:42.988 --> 18:46.116
* Is more than
sayin' sorry *

18:50.062 --> 18:53.793
* To forgive is divine *

18:53.866 --> 18:55.959
* So let's have
a glass of... *

18:58.237 --> 19:00.933
Okay. Who's the genius
behind this?

19:01.006 --> 19:03.304
The container said
"microwavable."

19:03.375 --> 19:04.899
But the aluminum
foil wasn't.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.502
Well, I'm not supposed to worry
about stuff like that.

19:07.579 --> 19:09.012
I'm the talent.

19:09.081 --> 19:11.413
Daddy, we're down.

19:11.483 --> 19:13.417
Not exactly warm
out here, is it?

19:13.485 --> 19:16.477
- How long till we're airborne again?
- Nice plane!

19:16.555 --> 19:19.149
- Not till tomorrow.
- Ah, terrific. Where are we?

19:19.224 --> 19:20.816
Not happy!

19:20.893 --> 19:23.657
We're on a private field
an hour outside of Trenton.

19:23.729 --> 19:26.664
Jersey?
We're in New Jersey?

19:26.732 --> 19:29.701
Hey, wait a minute.
Am I being Punk'd?

19:29.768 --> 19:31.668
Where's Ashton?
Ha!

19:31.737 --> 19:32.704
Ashton!

19:32.771 --> 19:34.705
Oh my God!
Ha ha.

19:34.773 --> 19:36.707
You totally got me!

19:36.775 --> 19:38.538
Ashton?

19:40.679 --> 19:43.239
I love it that you're taking me home
to meet your mom.

19:43.315 --> 19:45.249
Was this one of your
clever little plans?

19:45.317 --> 19:47.581
Yes. I planned you
setting the plane on fire.

19:48.720 --> 19:51.621
Surprise!

19:54.359 --> 19:56.224
Ow!

19:56.295 --> 19:58.855
Oh, my little boy.

20:02.601 --> 20:04.535
Be right down.

20:21.954 --> 20:25.412
* La da da, da da *

20:25.490 --> 20:29.722
* La da da da *

20:29.795 --> 20:33.526
* La da da, da da *

20:33.599 --> 20:36.534
* La da da da *

20:36.602 --> 20:40.231
* La da da, da da *

20:40.305 --> 20:44.173
* Da da da da. *

20:52.150 --> 20:54.482
I do not remember
Jersey being this cold.

20:54.553 --> 20:56.953
Well, it's been uncommonly
cold this month.

20:57.022 --> 21:00.321
We've gone through
seven bags of rock salt.

21:00.392 --> 21:02.053
Your house is just
so quaint, Mrs. Brander,

21:02.127 --> 21:04.618
I mean, Chris, you never told me
you were so provincial.

21:04.696 --> 21:06.960
It's like a true
rags to riches story,

21:07.032 --> 21:09.626
but I've always found the middle class to
be just so much more real.

21:11.136 --> 21:13.400
I mean, isn't Chris great?

21:13.472 --> 21:15.406
Yeah, he is a nice boy.

21:15.474 --> 21:18.773
You know, he usually
flies us out to Los Angeles.

21:18.844 --> 21:20.778
It's been, uh...

21:20.846 --> 21:23.144
oh, nine, 10...

21:23.215 --> 21:25.308
- It's 10 years. Yeah.
- 10?

21:25.384 --> 21:27.716
10 years
since he's been home.

21:27.786 --> 21:30.311
- All right. Good job, Dougie.
- Oh, hi, honey!

21:33.358 --> 21:35.053
Oh my God.

21:35.127 --> 21:38.119
- Mikey.
- Oh my God!

21:39.731 --> 21:42.928
- Is that my Christmas present?
- Sam, my younger brother Mike.

21:43.001 --> 21:45.663
- Samantha James.
- Samantha James.

21:45.737 --> 21:48.001
Mike Brander.
It is an honor.

21:48.073 --> 21:50.371
I have your poster
on my wall,

21:50.442 --> 21:53.775
- but you are way hotter in person.
- I know!

21:53.845 --> 21:56.313
- You have her poster on your wall?
- Yeah.

21:56.381 --> 21:58.440
I slapped the ham
to it like an hour ago.

21:58.517 --> 22:00.485
What ham did you slap?

22:00.552 --> 22:03.077
Not the ham
that I just bought?

22:03.155 --> 22:06.215
Oh, Mrs. Brander, do you have
anything else besides ham?

22:06.291 --> 22:07.986
Because I'm on
the Perricone diet

22:08.060 --> 22:09.891
and I need salmon
like now.

22:09.961 --> 22:13.453
I love salmon. It's the prettiest
color for bedrooms.

22:13.532 --> 22:16.524
- So relaxing.
- I'm gonna start drinking.

22:16.601 --> 22:18.660
Um, does anybody want anything?
Some coffee?

22:18.737 --> 22:20.329
Maybe some salmon
or something?

22:20.405 --> 22:22.339
Just gonna...

22:22.407 --> 22:23.999
yeah.

22:24.076 --> 22:25.839
Mike! Good to be home.

22:34.019 --> 22:37.682
Oh, boy. Okay.

22:37.756 --> 22:41.214
Hi. Yes, I know,
very exciting.

22:41.293 --> 22:43.887
Hi. Hi.

22:43.962 --> 22:45.896
Oh. Chris,
let's get it to go.

22:45.964 --> 22:48.057
People are staring at me.

22:49.568 --> 22:51.502
Oh my God...
plastic menus!

22:51.570 --> 22:54.300
Well, this isn't gonna work,
is it now, Chris?

22:54.373 --> 22:55.340
Chris?

22:58.477 --> 23:00.411
Excuse me, but I was
wondering if you think

23:00.479 --> 23:02.538
America will ever switch
to the metric system?

23:02.614 --> 23:04.411
Well, that's
a very interesting...

23:06.017 --> 23:09.544
- Oh my God! Chris!
- I don't believe this!

23:09.621 --> 23:12.818
- Oh! God, you look great!
- I don't... you look great!

23:12.891 --> 23:15.416
- Well, thank you! How you been?
- We're married.

23:15.494 --> 23:17.553
- You're married!
- Married?

23:17.629 --> 23:20.189
- Oh, yeah, we're married, we got a kid. TJ.
- We have a son. TJ.

23:20.265 --> 23:22.392
- TJ!
- He looks like me. He's got Clark's eyes...

23:22.467 --> 23:24.435
Oh my God!
Where does the time go?

23:24.503 --> 23:27.063
He's like the creative mind kid, he's like,
brilliant and you can meet him.

23:27.139 --> 23:29.699
- That's great!
- God, look at those teeth!

23:29.775 --> 23:31.640
Those are some nice veneers
you got, my friend.

23:31.710 --> 23:33.678
- Don't tell me that you're a dentist.
- A dentist?

23:33.745 --> 23:37.476
- I totally sold out, dude.
- Hey, you and me both, buddy.

23:37.549 --> 23:40.313
Hey, lover, aren't you
gonna introduce me, huh?

23:40.385 --> 23:41.977
Yes!

23:42.053 --> 23:43.782
Samantha, these are
my old friends.

23:43.855 --> 23:46.016
This is Clark,
this is Darla.

23:46.091 --> 23:49.117
Your names are
"Clark" and "Darla"?

23:49.194 --> 23:50.320
- Yeah.
- Mm-hm.

23:50.395 --> 23:53.091
Oh my God,
that is so cute!

23:53.165 --> 23:55.258
I just wanna
eat you both up!

23:57.002 --> 23:59.937
Okay, I am gonna go
to the little girl's room.

24:00.005 --> 24:01.905
- Good.
- And then we're outie.

24:01.973 --> 24:04.703
- Okay.
- Okay.

24:04.776 --> 24:07.677
She's... uh, incoming.

24:07.746 --> 24:09.543
Oh my God.

24:09.614 --> 24:12.048
Check out that
girl's ass. Huge!

24:13.452 --> 24:15.477
It was so nice
meeting you.

24:17.255 --> 24:20.747
Mm. Darla.

24:24.563 --> 24:26.656
She's adorable.

24:26.731 --> 24:28.961
- And affectionate.
- Christ sakes.

24:29.034 --> 24:32.060
- Chris Brander, ladies and gentlemen!
- Yes! You guys, so good...

24:32.137 --> 24:34.469
Chris Brander?
Chris Brander?

24:34.539 --> 24:36.063
Holy...

24:36.141 --> 24:39.872
I saw you at the Grammys
sitting next to P. Diddy!

24:40.912 --> 24:42.607
It's me Tim.
You remember?

24:42.681 --> 24:44.012
Oh, how could I
forget you, Tim?

24:44.082 --> 24:46.016
Hey, you got $5

24:46.084 --> 24:48.211
that I can,
like, have?

24:49.254 --> 24:51.222
Yeah.

24:51.289 --> 24:53.018
You keep
living the dream, Tim.

24:53.091 --> 24:53.989
Done!

24:54.059 --> 24:55.151
Buh-bye now.

24:55.227 --> 24:58.196
- Class of '95!
- Class of '95!

24:58.263 --> 24:59.992
Here's your money,
bitch!

25:00.065 --> 25:02.295
- He looks good.
- Man, I can't believe...

25:02.367 --> 25:04.528
wha... like what happened?
Where did you go?

25:04.603 --> 25:07.436
Hey, you know...
just migrated west.

25:07.606 --> 25:10.097
You know, I'm living
the dream out there, I guess.

25:10.175 --> 25:12.234
I just stayed with my dad
for awhile, and...

25:12.310 --> 25:15.677
yeah, hocked my soul
for a record executive job...

25:15.747 --> 25:18.841
and started...
I mean I had an internship first

25:18.917 --> 25:20.350
- a couple of years.
- Uh-huh, right.

25:22.821 --> 25:25.187
Jamie.

25:29.227 --> 25:30.694
Jamie?

25:32.063 --> 25:34.691
- Chris, hi!
- Hi!

25:34.766 --> 25:37.667
What are you
doing down there?

25:37.736 --> 25:40.603
Oh, I'm just busted!

25:40.672 --> 25:44.267
How are you?
Oh, shit. Hold on.

25:45.310 --> 25:47.244
Wow!

25:47.312 --> 25:49.041
Look at you!

25:49.114 --> 25:50.741
Oh my God,

25:50.815 --> 25:53.147
I can put my
arms around you.

25:54.953 --> 25:57.581
- You look so great! Look at this body!
- Thank you.

25:57.656 --> 25:59.385
- You're like a new man!
- Yeah.

25:59.457 --> 26:02.426
These arms
and your belly,

26:02.494 --> 26:04.485
and look at...
pecs, and...

26:04.563 --> 26:07.123
Wow! Chris Brander.

26:07.198 --> 26:10.099
God.
Jamie Palamino.

26:13.238 --> 26:16.071
So, um... so how long
are you in town for?

26:16.141 --> 26:18.268
Um, just the night,
actually.

26:18.343 --> 26:20.607
Just one night, really?
You can't stay any longer?

26:20.679 --> 26:23.842
No. I wish I could, but l...

26:23.915 --> 26:25.883
Let's go, Chris.
There's pee on the floor.

26:28.653 --> 26:32.111
- Yeah.
- Okay, um...

26:32.190 --> 26:34.818
all right, well...

26:34.893 --> 26:38.454
- it's really great to see you again.
- You too.

26:38.530 --> 26:41.055
Oh.

26:41.132 --> 26:42.622
Wow...

26:45.804 --> 26:47.669
Just give me
a call sometime.

26:47.739 --> 26:49.764
I'm living
with my parents.

26:49.841 --> 26:52.742
Oh, I know.
I'm living with my parents.

26:54.145 --> 26:55.874
Okay, bye.

26:57.148 --> 26:59.116
- Bye.
- Bye.

27:01.620 --> 27:04.680
- Jamie Pal.
- Whoa!

27:04.756 --> 27:06.189
She's like a box
of fine wine.

27:06.257 --> 27:08.953
You would know.

27:09.027 --> 27:11.689
You know, in high school
you'd never get a girl like that.

27:11.763 --> 27:13.731
And now you get
whoever you want.

27:15.800 --> 27:18.496
I bet you could
definitely hit Jamie Pal.

27:18.570 --> 27:21.038
- Definitely.
- Okay. Okay.

27:25.977 --> 27:27.672
- Excuse me.
- Oh yeah.

27:27.746 --> 27:29.976
You go! Whoo!

27:30.048 --> 27:32.278
- Hey!
- Hey!

27:32.350 --> 27:35.649
Look, there is a chance that my
flight might be delayed an extra day.

27:35.720 --> 27:38.188
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- Um, nothing.

27:38.256 --> 27:40.952
- Do you want to meet for lunch?
- You mean like a day date?

27:41.026 --> 27:42.960
Yeah.

27:43.028 --> 27:44.495
Great!

27:44.562 --> 27:46.496
Chris! Chris!

27:46.564 --> 27:49.032
- I'll pick you up at noon.
- Chris! Chris!

27:49.100 --> 27:52.263
- Chris! Chris! Chris!
- Awesome, I'm really...

27:52.337 --> 27:55.568
- I'm busy!
- I'm busy! Stupid dick!

27:55.640 --> 27:58.404
- That sounds awesome. I'll see you then.
- Bye.

28:00.712 --> 28:02.577
Let's go.

28:04.449 --> 28:05.916
- What was that all about?
- Nothing.

28:05.984 --> 28:07.576
It's just an old
friend saying hi.

28:07.652 --> 28:09.586
Yeah, well, let's
keep it that way.

28:09.654 --> 28:12.555
- It's not a handball.
- My handball.

28:12.624 --> 28:15.058
Meow. Meow.

28:24.102 --> 28:28.163
* I used to know you
when we were young *

28:28.239 --> 28:31.640
* You were
in all my dreams *

28:31.710 --> 28:36.340
* We sat together
in period one *

28:36.414 --> 28:39.383
* Fridays at 8:15... *

28:39.451 --> 28:43.410
- Whoa.
- * But I will wait for you *

28:43.488 --> 28:47.857
* As long as I need to *

28:47.926 --> 28:52.420
* And if you ever get
back to Hackensack *

28:52.497 --> 28:58.231
* I'll be here for you. *

29:03.575 --> 29:09.070
* Jesus Christ our savior
was born upon this day *

29:09.147 --> 29:12.082
* To save us all
from Satan's power *

29:12.150 --> 29:14.778
* When we were
gone astray *

29:14.853 --> 29:16.320
* Oh, tidings... *

29:16.387 --> 29:17.786
Hey! Dumb-ass.

29:18.823 --> 29:20.017
Wake up.

29:20.091 --> 29:22.025
- Hey, wake up.
- Ah! Agh!

29:22.093 --> 29:23.617
Morning.

29:23.695 --> 29:25.663
Ow ow!

29:26.698 --> 29:28.188
Agh! What?

29:28.266 --> 29:29.893
I need you to
do me a favor.

29:29.968 --> 29:31.902
What do you
want from me?!

29:31.970 --> 29:33.665
I ran into Jamie Palomino
last night.

29:33.738 --> 29:35.729
Oh, here we go again.

29:35.807 --> 29:38.071
I'm not the same person
I was in high-school, pal.

29:38.143 --> 29:39.804
You'll always be fat
to me, Chris.

29:39.878 --> 29:42.108
What do you want from me?!

29:42.180 --> 29:44.648
I need you
to detain Samantha.

29:44.716 --> 29:46.274
I could do that.

29:46.618 --> 29:49.917
- Chris, wait!
- It's a beautiful day.

29:49.988 --> 29:52.047
What about Paris?

29:52.123 --> 29:54.887
Look, Paris can wait. This is important.
You don't wanna be

29:54.959 --> 29:57.018
- out of touch with your audience, do you?
- No.

29:57.095 --> 29:58.995
No, well then, you need
to connect with your audience,

29:59.063 --> 30:00.394
you need to feed off their energy.

30:00.465 --> 30:02.865
After all, they're the ones who're
gonna be buying your album.

30:02.934 --> 30:04.868
The problem is where
in New Jersey are we gonna find

30:04.936 --> 30:07.063
a proper cross-section
of your fans?

30:08.439 --> 30:10.532
- The mall?
- A mall!

30:10.608 --> 30:12.132
That's a great idea!

30:13.711 --> 30:15.611
- We have so much in common!
- I know!

30:15.680 --> 30:17.614
- God.
- Let's do it to it!

30:17.682 --> 30:19.445
Whoa! I am not
going with him!

30:19.517 --> 30:22.611
Look, what better way to relate
to your fans than to go with one?

30:22.687 --> 30:24.655
In we go.

30:24.722 --> 30:27.156
Hey! You're not
coming with me?

30:27.225 --> 30:29.591
- Hmm-mm.
- No, sweetie. You need to do this alone.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.322
- I can't be your crutch.
- But l...

30:31.396 --> 30:32.829
Watch your face!

30:32.897 --> 30:34.728
Buckle up!

30:40.872 --> 30:42.840
Great.
That's good.

30:42.907 --> 30:44.465
That's looking good.

30:48.179 --> 30:51.080
Great, guys.
Really good.

30:53.184 --> 30:55.516
Mr. Palamino,
how you doing?

30:55.587 --> 30:57.418
Well well well,

30:57.488 --> 31:00.651
if it isn't
Mr. Valentine's Day!

31:00.725 --> 31:04.058
This guy, every Valentine's Day,
he'd buy Jamie like a dozen roses.

31:04.128 --> 31:06.926
Used to drive all
her boyfriends nuts!

31:06.998 --> 31:09.899
Ha! Till we explained, of course,
it was just her little friend Chris.

31:09.968 --> 31:11.936
Yeah,
I remember that.

31:12.003 --> 31:14.369
You prick.

31:14.439 --> 31:17.340
I see you still have the best
Christmas display in town, sir.

31:17.408 --> 31:19.569
- Hey! In the state!
- Hey, Chris!

31:19.644 --> 31:21.271
I'll be right out.

31:21.346 --> 31:24.179
So, uh, how'd you
lose all that weight?

31:24.249 --> 31:26.843
Like that retard
from Subway?

31:26.918 --> 31:28.351
It was great
talking to you, sir.

31:30.788 --> 31:32.722
Are you kidding me?

31:32.790 --> 31:34.724
I rented the nicest Porsche
in New Jersey.

31:34.792 --> 31:36.521
I'm just gonna play
this whole thing aloof

31:36.594 --> 31:38.926
and she's gonna be eating out
of the palm of my hand in no time.

31:38.997 --> 31:41.090
Gotta go.

31:41.165 --> 31:42.928
Hey.

31:43.001 --> 31:46.459
Wow! Porsche.
Girls must love this.

31:46.537 --> 31:49.165
I hate this stupid thing too.
It's a rental.

31:49.240 --> 31:52.175
So ostentatious.
It's all they had left.

31:52.243 --> 31:54.211
Hmm.

31:57.482 --> 32:00.474
- God, this place hasn't changed a bit.
- I know.

32:00.551 --> 32:02.542
Are you sure that you don't want
to go someplace else?

32:02.620 --> 32:05.748
- No, we can't leave. We have history here.
- History.

32:05.823 --> 32:09.691
Oh my goodness,
I remember you two.

32:09.761 --> 32:12.889
Oh, you're not
a chubby bunny anymore.

32:12.964 --> 32:15.990
- Oh, my personal space.
- I'll be right back.

32:16.067 --> 32:18.968
I've got a little
surprise for you.

32:19.037 --> 32:21.301
Can't wait.

32:21.372 --> 32:22.839
Haha!
Chubby bunny!

32:22.907 --> 32:25.671
Ahh! Thanks for
reminding me I was fat.

32:27.612 --> 32:29.671
So why did you disappear
on me 10 years ago?

32:30.915 --> 32:33.145
Uh, listen, about that...

32:33.217 --> 32:34.775
Where you
that mad at me?

32:34.852 --> 32:38.151
Come on, Jamie. It was like
100 years ago, all right?

32:38.222 --> 32:40.588
I'm not that pathetic
little dweeb anymore.

32:40.658 --> 32:44.321
You were never
a dweeb, Chris.

32:44.395 --> 32:47.364
- So, tell me about your job.
- Oh my God.

32:47.432 --> 32:49.764
You know, once you get over
all the glamour, you know, it's uh...

32:49.834 --> 32:51.597
- it's nothing but total insanity.
- Mm.

32:51.669 --> 32:54.229
You know, if it's not Pink calling you, then
you got Good Charlotte...

32:54.305 --> 32:57.604
it's Jay Z's birthday party, you know, and
I'm totally name-dropping right now

32:57.675 --> 33:00.200
and I'd really like to stop.
Mick Jagger. How 'bout you?

33:00.278 --> 33:02.940
You know, what happened to you?
How'd you end up working at The Maple?

33:03.014 --> 33:04.879
I don't work
at The Maple.

33:04.949 --> 33:07.474
I mean, I work at The Maple
but I don't really work at The Maple.

33:07.552 --> 33:09.144
- Yeah.
- I'm studying to be a teacher

33:09.220 --> 33:10.710
so I'm living at home
and I'm working...

33:10.788 --> 33:13.052
It's the coast.
Be right back.

33:16.160 --> 33:18.287
What happened to him?

33:18.629 --> 33:20.961
* Five golden rings *

33:21.032 --> 33:23.899
- * Four calling birds *
- I don't care what your mommy said.

33:23.968 --> 33:26.095
* Three French hens,
two turtle doves *

33:26.170 --> 33:27.660
Oh, this is gonna be a great song.
"Mall People."

33:27.739 --> 33:29.764
"Mall people,
they come and go...

33:29.841 --> 33:31.809
small people,
they just don't know."

33:31.876 --> 33:34.436
- How's it goin'?
- Fantastic.

33:34.512 --> 33:35.979
- How's it going with Jamie?
- Treating her like

33:36.047 --> 33:38.379
- every boyfriend she's ever had.
- You da man!

33:38.449 --> 33:40.781
- So I wanna run an idea by you.
- No.

33:40.852 --> 33:44.185
Since you're trying to hook up with Jamie,
what if I went to Paris with Samantha

33:44.255 --> 33:45.950
- instead of you? That way you...
- No.

33:46.024 --> 33:47.582
- You haven't heard the whole thing yet!
- No.

33:47.658 --> 33:49.922
You know what, just... just think
about it and get back to me.

33:49.994 --> 33:51.655
Ow!

33:54.298 --> 33:57.199
- Oh my God!
- I gotta go.

34:03.508 --> 34:05.840
- So, how's the coast?
- Super.

34:05.910 --> 34:08.208
Here we go!

34:08.279 --> 34:10.907
One grilled cheese
with ranch on the side

34:10.982 --> 34:15.179
and one Sugar Mountain Supreme
for the chubby bunny.

34:15.253 --> 34:17.813
Excuse me, um,

34:17.889 --> 34:20.050
this-this... this isn't
gonna work for me.

34:20.123 --> 34:22.717
But this is what
you always order.

34:22.793 --> 34:25.728
Yeah. 10 years ago,
when I was a whale.

34:25.797 --> 34:28.561
The pancakes are fine.
He's just kidding.

34:28.632 --> 34:30.225
What?

34:31.902 --> 34:34.895
- Be more rude!
- She's rude! She's rude!

34:34.972 --> 34:37.304
I haven't had sweets
in 10 years, okay? Do you know

34:37.375 --> 34:39.809
- what this would do to my stomach?
- Relax, little girl.

34:39.877 --> 34:42.869
I'll have the pancakes and you
can have my sandwich, okay?

34:44.081 --> 34:46.482
I'll just enjoy
this glass of water.

34:49.286 --> 34:51.050
I'm stuffed.

34:57.161 --> 35:00.028
Good times.
Good times!

35:00.098 --> 35:01.565
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

35:01.632 --> 35:03.623
- Thanks again for lunch.
- Oh, I'll get your door.

35:03.701 --> 35:05.726
Oh. Okay.

35:05.803 --> 35:07.236
Shit.

35:12.477 --> 35:14.445
- Whew!
- Yeah.

35:16.814 --> 35:19.180
Well, it was great
seeing you again.

35:19.250 --> 35:20.683
You too.

35:20.751 --> 35:22.150
Yeah, glad I ran
into you last night.

35:22.220 --> 35:24.154
Yeah, it was
a surprise.

35:24.222 --> 35:26.156
Big surprise.
Yeah.

35:26.224 --> 35:27.816
It's cold out here.

35:27.892 --> 35:29.826
Yeah, it is.
It's like the South Pole.

35:29.894 --> 35:32.658
It's like the deep South Pole
if there was one.

35:32.730 --> 35:34.459
There isn't, though.

35:34.532 --> 35:36.193
Um, thanks for walking
me to my door.

35:36.267 --> 35:39.100
Yeah. Again, it was
great seeing you...

35:39.170 --> 35:40.137
again.

35:40.204 --> 35:41.967
- You, too.
- Yeah.

35:42.039 --> 35:44.337
Take care. Uh...

35:44.408 --> 35:46.638
Yeah, you too.
Oh, uh...

35:49.213 --> 35:50.976
- Oh.
- That's good.

35:51.048 --> 35:53.414
Ow!

35:54.852 --> 35:57.184
- Take care.
- You too.

35:58.389 --> 35:59.515
Hmm.

36:21.612 --> 36:24.877
Stupid! Stupid!
Stupid!

36:24.949 --> 36:26.814
What the hell?!

36:29.854 --> 36:31.788
God!

36:36.327 --> 36:38.090
Oh my God!

36:38.162 --> 36:40.790
It's the South Pole!
It's the deep South Pole?

36:40.865 --> 36:42.856
It's the South Pole.
The deep South Pole!

36:42.934 --> 36:44.959
I don't think there is one,
but if there was one

36:45.036 --> 36:47.095
I bet it would be
in the south!

36:56.480 --> 36:59.574
- I left my gloves in the car.
- Oh.

37:06.290 --> 37:07.757
- There you go.
- Thanks.

37:20.004 --> 37:21.801
Hey, look who's here!
What's up, Hollywood?

37:21.872 --> 37:23.533
- How the big date go?
- It was terrible.

37:23.608 --> 37:25.940
I went in for a kiss,
but she wants a hug, okay?

37:26.010 --> 37:28.570
Then I get caught in a sort
of kiss-hug limbo type thing.

37:28.646 --> 37:32.514
I don't know what that is, then I
ended up shaking her entire body.

37:32.583 --> 37:35.245
So y-you gave her
a body shake?

37:35.319 --> 37:38.777
Oh, God! I should've just kissed her!
What am I doing?

37:38.856 --> 37:41.347
It looks like you picked up right
where you left off.

37:41.425 --> 37:42.983
You're back
in the friend zone.

37:44.028 --> 37:45.518
Oh, f-f...

38:00.211 --> 38:02.145
What?

38:02.213 --> 38:03.942
Little problem.

38:04.248 --> 38:06.944
Okay, she's got
a bit of a headache.

38:07.018 --> 38:09.145
It's not that bad. Ha!

38:10.988 --> 38:12.046
Oh my God!

38:12.123 --> 38:14.523
What the hell
happened to her?

38:14.592 --> 38:16.958
Long story short,
she fell.

38:17.028 --> 38:18.859
Samantha, are you okay?

38:18.929 --> 38:20.590
I'm gonna make bubble.

38:20.665 --> 38:22.428
Dude, she's fine!

38:22.500 --> 38:25.298
Look at her. She's having a good time.
She's got her toothpaste.

38:25.369 --> 38:28.270
All you had to do was watch her for a few
hours. What did you do to her?

38:28.339 --> 38:31.103
Nothing! She's just all
loopy from all the Vicodin.

38:31.175 --> 38:33.336
Where did you
get the Vicodin?

38:33.411 --> 38:35.379
Mom.

38:35.446 --> 38:37.243
Blueberry!

38:37.315 --> 38:39.681
Okay.
I'm gonna kill you.

38:39.750 --> 38:41.479
What?!
You said detain her!

38:41.552 --> 38:43.577
- You're a dead man, Mike!
- She's detained!

38:45.256 --> 38:46.917
Eww.

38:46.991 --> 38:48.458
- My balls!
- Oh.

38:50.594 --> 38:52.926
You're dead.

38:52.997 --> 38:54.931
No, Chris! No!

38:54.999 --> 38:56.933
Chris...

38:57.001 --> 38:58.730
Chris, no!

39:00.404 --> 39:01.996
- My boss! Truce!
- Truce!

39:02.073 --> 39:03.700
- Truce!
- Okay.

39:03.774 --> 39:04.763
- Hello?
- Nyah!

39:04.842 --> 39:06.707
Hey, Chrissy!

39:06.777 --> 39:08.711
How's my future star doing?

39:08.779 --> 39:10.406
Great.
She's doing great, sir.

39:10.481 --> 39:12.711
So let me... let me...
let me say hi to her.

39:12.783 --> 39:14.978
Uh, she's a little incapacitated
at the moment.

39:15.052 --> 39:18.146
Oh, a little incapacitated,
that's my baby, that's my boy!

39:18.222 --> 39:22.022
Look, when you two get back, I've got this
incredible marketing campaign

39:22.093 --> 39:24.721
lined up for the spring quarter.
Our number one priority:

39:24.795 --> 39:28.060
- Samantha James!
- Awesome.

39:28.132 --> 39:30.862
Three two, one!

39:30.935 --> 39:33.870
Ho-ho-ho.

39:33.938 --> 39:37.237
- Yeah-ha-ha! Yeah!
- Merry Christmas!

39:37.308 --> 39:39.401
It's a Palamino Christmas!

39:39.477 --> 39:41.445
Again!

39:44.215 --> 39:46.149
- Hello?
- Jamie.

39:46.217 --> 39:48.412
- Hey.
- What's up?

39:48.486 --> 39:51.387
Listen, you're never gonna believe this,
but I can't get a flight out.

39:51.455 --> 39:53.719
- I'm stuck here another day.
- Oh.

39:53.791 --> 39:55.281
I want to apologize
for earlier.

39:55.359 --> 39:56.849
- Let me make it up to you.
- I taste good.

39:56.927 --> 39:58.895
Do you want to go
ice skating?

39:58.963 --> 40:01.454
- I thought you hated ice skating.
- I used to,

40:01.532 --> 40:04.433
but you know, I'm actually
pretty damn good now.

40:04.502 --> 40:05.764
I'm the MVP
in my league, in fact.

40:05.836 --> 40:08.031
Come on, it'll be
like old times.

40:09.573 --> 40:12.508
- Hello, Joyce?
- Mom? I'm on the phone.

40:12.576 --> 40:16.273
Oh! Well, Chris, what are you
doing over at Joyce's?

40:16.347 --> 40:19.180
No, Mom. I'm in the living room,
10 feet away from you

40:19.250 --> 40:21.081
- and I'm on the phone.
- Oh.

40:21.152 --> 40:22.551
Well, you know,
I was wondering

40:22.620 --> 40:25.350
while I have you on the phone,
what would you like for dinner?

40:25.423 --> 40:29.120
We-we have a choice between chicken
chow mein or pot roast.

40:29.193 --> 40:31.252
Mom. Please.

40:31.328 --> 40:33.387
Mom!

40:33.464 --> 40:36.058
- Mom!
- What is it, peanut?

40:36.133 --> 40:37.293
Where are my ice skates?

40:37.368 --> 40:40.064
Oh, honey, I gave
those away years ago.

40:40.137 --> 40:42.071
Are you serious?
I need them.

40:42.139 --> 40:45.267
Well, honey, why would I keep them?
You're never here.

40:45.342 --> 40:47.867
Besides, you-you weren't
terribly good at ice skating.

40:47.945 --> 40:49.879
Well, I'm good now!

40:49.947 --> 40:52.313
And I need my skates
to show off my talents.

40:52.383 --> 40:55.841
Oh, well, honey,
I'm sure you can rent a pair.

40:55.920 --> 40:58.480
Besides, you don't have
to show off for Jamie.

40:58.556 --> 41:01.047
Just...
just be yourself.

41:01.125 --> 41:03.923
* Be yourself *

41:03.994 --> 41:08.795
* Be yourself,
be yourself. *

41:08.866 --> 41:12.302
Now, come on! Mikey and I are
making snow angels!

41:13.938 --> 41:15.872
I don't want
to be myself.

41:18.275 --> 41:19.970
My snow globe collection.

41:26.283 --> 41:30.117
* Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way *

41:30.187 --> 41:32.121
* Oh what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh... *

41:32.189 --> 41:34.987
- Oof! Stupid rental skates.
- Ooh!

41:35.059 --> 41:37.892
You know what?
You're a lot better than before.

41:37.962 --> 41:40.863
- I'm wearing figure skates from the '30s.
- Here, let me help you.

41:40.931 --> 41:42.796
Okay, I can do it myself, okay?
I'm good. I'm good now.

41:42.867 --> 41:45.199
Hey.

41:47.037 --> 41:48.800
- So...
- So...

41:48.873 --> 41:52.934
- How's the love life?
- Lame.

41:53.010 --> 41:56.741
- Marty and I broke up a year ago.
- Ooh, another jerk, huh?

41:56.814 --> 41:58.839
- "Another jerk, huh?"
- I'm kidding...

41:58.916 --> 42:00.850
I'm just saying you
dated a lot of jerks

42:00.918 --> 42:02.818
back in high school,
that's all.

42:02.887 --> 42:06.584
So how about you? You in love
with anyone besides yourself?

42:06.657 --> 42:09.785
No.

42:09.860 --> 42:12.658
I've really just
been dating, you know?

42:12.730 --> 42:14.994
Just trying to look
for my soulmate.

42:15.065 --> 42:16.225
You didn't buy that,
did you?

42:16.300 --> 42:18.461
Maybe you
should try harder.

42:18.536 --> 42:21.733
Or I could try this.

42:22.907 --> 42:24.397
Oh...

42:25.976 --> 42:28.774
Hey guys,
it's Miss Palamino!

42:28.846 --> 42:30.837
Yay!

42:30.915 --> 42:32.974
Hi, guys.

42:33.050 --> 42:35.917
Sarah and Joey
and Brett. Hi!

42:35.986 --> 42:38.819
- What, you... you know these kids?
- Yeah, I substitute teach

42:38.889 --> 42:41.585
- their class.
- Hey, um, we're having a pickup game.

42:41.659 --> 42:44.219
We could use some more bodies.
You guys play?

42:44.295 --> 42:46.889
You know Chris is a great player,
but he has rentals.

42:46.964 --> 42:50.365
- A good skater can skate in anything.
- Yeah!

42:50.434 --> 42:52.265
I'm in.

42:53.871 --> 42:58.103
Okay, guys. Keep it clean.

42:58.175 --> 42:59.335
- Oof!
- Shoot it!

42:59.410 --> 43:02.038
Get it in!
And goal!

43:04.081 --> 43:07.175
- What was that?!
- You're pathetic!

43:07.251 --> 43:09.151
I'm sorry, okay?

43:09.219 --> 43:11.449
It's just these damn
rental skates.

43:11.522 --> 43:14.616
It's fine. Just don't cuss in front
of the children.

43:14.692 --> 43:16.421
Potty mouth.

43:17.962 --> 43:20.624
Get him, Terry!

43:20.698 --> 43:23.030
Ow!

43:23.100 --> 43:25.159
He hacked me!

43:25.235 --> 43:26.896
Wanna fight, punk?

43:26.971 --> 43:29.439
- What, are you kidding me?
- Fight!

43:29.506 --> 43:32.066
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!

43:32.142 --> 43:35.305
All right, all right,
break it up, break it up.

43:35.379 --> 43:38.143
What is your problem?
She's just a child.

43:38.215 --> 43:40.615
- That's a girl?
- Pussy!

43:46.323 --> 43:49.622
- Yeah!
- All right!

43:53.797 --> 43:56.095
Okay, listen. We're getting
creamed out there.

43:56.166 --> 43:58.634
- It's his fault.
- You suck, Brander.

43:58.702 --> 44:01.000
- Hey.
- I brand you "Suckster."

44:01.071 --> 44:02.868
- Oh my... that's enough.
- Hey.

44:02.940 --> 44:05.431
Now Chris is trying
his best here.

44:05.509 --> 44:08.103
Sorry, Miss Palamino,
but he's just so terrible.

44:08.178 --> 44:11.375
- I'm not terrible.
- Suckster! Suckster! Suckster! Suckster!

44:11.448 --> 44:13.780
- Maybe you should call it a day.
- No, I can do this!

44:13.851 --> 44:16.285
- Suckster! Suckster. Suckster! Suckster...
- Hey!

44:16.353 --> 44:18.116
I'm a really good skater,
little girl!

44:18.188 --> 44:21.646
Watch! You might
learn something!

44:21.725 --> 44:23.420
I'm taking this one.

44:27.364 --> 44:29.798
Me?

44:36.240 --> 44:37.172
Ah!

44:37.241 --> 44:39.971
Chris, no!

44:44.014 --> 44:46.175
Ahh!

44:51.755 --> 44:55.191
No!

44:56.860 --> 44:59.522
No slap shots!

45:11.241 --> 45:13.106
Suckster! Suckster!

45:13.177 --> 45:16.203
Suckster! Suckster!
Suckster!

45:16.280 --> 45:18.373
Suckster! Suckster!

45:18.449 --> 45:22.044
- What a schmuck.
- Don't worry, Chris. You're gonna be fine.

45:25.756 --> 45:27.280
Oh...

45:29.526 --> 45:31.551
- Wow.
- Well, it looks like I was

45:31.628 --> 45:34.324
- in the right place at the right time, Miss...
- Yeah.

45:34.398 --> 45:37.299
Palamino?
Jamie Palamino.

45:37.367 --> 45:40.097
- Dusty Dinkleman?
- Ah, yeah.

45:40.170 --> 45:42.695
Actually, I go by
"Dusty Lee" now, but yeah.

45:42.773 --> 45:45.435
- "Dutty Nee?"
- Thanks for saving me.

45:45.509 --> 45:47.977
Yay, Dusty!

45:48.045 --> 45:50.206
- You remember Chris Brander?
- Eeh.

45:50.280 --> 45:52.612
- Boo...
- Oh, yeah.

45:52.683 --> 45:55.243
Seen better days, I guess, huh, pal?

45:55.319 --> 45:57.617
Hey, listen, I don't
want to make this weird,

45:57.688 --> 45:59.588
but you look incredible.

45:59.656 --> 46:02.523
- So do you.
- Really glad you dropped in.

46:03.794 --> 46:05.819
Ow!

46:11.602 --> 46:13.536
Cool...

46:15.539 --> 46:18.804
Sorry about that, buddy.

46:18.876 --> 46:20.707
Here we go.

46:22.746 --> 46:24.737
Late '20s.
Male Caucasian

46:24.815 --> 46:27.978
with multiple lacerations on lower
mandible and possible concussion.

46:28.051 --> 46:29.712
Transport en route,
over.

46:29.787 --> 46:31.846
- 104.
- So, uh, Jamie,

46:31.922 --> 46:34.618
- you still living in town?
- Oh, yeah, I just moved back.

46:34.691 --> 46:36.625
Oh, really?
Me too.

46:36.693 --> 46:39.059
- It's a small world.
- No kidding.

46:39.129 --> 46:40.391
Jeez, you know,

46:40.464 --> 46:43.297
I cannot get over
how great you look.

46:43.367 --> 46:45.961
Oh, pfft. Me?
Look at you!

46:46.036 --> 46:48.231
Yeah, I guess
my skin cleared up

46:48.305 --> 46:49.966
and I lost my stammer,

46:50.040 --> 46:52.167
but I still play
a mean guitar.

46:52.242 --> 46:54.642
I'm actually only doing this part-time
till I can make it in music.

46:54.711 --> 46:57.908
You know, Chris is in the music business
too. He could probably help you.

46:57.981 --> 47:00.745
Oh, hey.
Easy there, Gretzky.

47:00.818 --> 47:03.150
Shh.

47:03.220 --> 47:06.781
You know, we should hang out,
you know, have lunch sometime?

47:07.825 --> 47:10.623
I would love
to have lunch.

47:10.694 --> 47:12.389
Um, where can I give you
my phone number?

47:12.462 --> 47:13.986
Just write it on this.

47:18.769 --> 47:20.930
Jamie Palamino.

47:21.004 --> 47:22.596
This is bullshit!

47:22.673 --> 47:24.334
You haven't aged a peep.

47:28.212 --> 47:31.943
What do you know
about Dusty Dinkleman?

47:32.015 --> 47:33.346
- You mean Dusty Lee?
- Yeah.

47:33.417 --> 47:35.385
Works in the building,
drives ambulance. Why?

47:35.452 --> 47:38.979
Well check this out.
So I'm out with Jamie again...

47:39.056 --> 47:40.717
Another day date?

47:40.791 --> 47:43.259
Yes. Anyway,

47:43.327 --> 47:44.954
we're having
a great time

47:45.028 --> 47:47.326
and then Dusty shows up
out of nowhere,

47:47.397 --> 47:49.831
and then Jamie
gives him her number.

47:49.900 --> 47:53.267
Hey, didn't Dusty have like
a huge crush on Jamie?

47:53.337 --> 47:55.737
- Uh...
- Yeah, you got some

47:55.806 --> 47:58.104
competition there, Chris.
I mean, Dusty is a really nice guy.

47:58.175 --> 48:00.666
Yeah, well Jamie
doesn't date nice guys.

48:00.744 --> 48:02.336
She puts them in
the friend zone

48:02.412 --> 48:04.277
and then tortures
the shit out of them.

48:04.348 --> 48:06.782
I don't know. Jamie's come
a long way since high school.

48:06.850 --> 48:09.444
I think she
might be maturing.

48:09.519 --> 48:11.043
Maturing?

48:12.723 --> 48:14.691
So that's why
she went with Dusty.

48:14.758 --> 48:16.623
She wants
a sensitive guy...

48:16.693 --> 48:18.627
more like the old me.

48:18.695 --> 48:20.458
Well, if she wants
Mr. Rogers,

48:20.530 --> 48:22.464
then I'm going
to show her

48:22.532 --> 48:24.397
the biggest pussy
she's ever seen.

48:24.468 --> 48:26.333
Yeah.

48:26.403 --> 48:28.598
Okay, we're done.
Now, uh...

48:28.672 --> 48:31.106
you're gonna need to wear this
for the next few days

48:31.174 --> 48:34.166
until those stitches
are ready to come out.

48:34.244 --> 48:36.940
And here you go. Huh?
Just like your old yearbook picture.

48:39.082 --> 48:42.142
* Feel my love from afar. *

48:42.219 --> 48:44.346
Come in!

48:44.421 --> 48:47.117
- Can I come in?
- I just said that.

48:49.359 --> 48:51.452
I brought magazines.

48:51.528 --> 48:53.496
Ugh, these are old.

48:53.563 --> 48:56.691
- Flowers?
- Those are daisies.

48:56.767 --> 48:59.998
- How about snacks?
- Carbs? Are you kidding me?

49:00.070 --> 49:01.503
I can't eat that crap.

49:01.571 --> 49:03.766
I'm just trying
to be helpful.

49:03.840 --> 49:07.503
Well you're not.
So vamoose.

49:07.577 --> 49:10.910
- I guess I'll just leave you now.
- No, wait wait.

49:10.981 --> 49:13.506
I'm sorry I'm being
such a biatch.

49:13.583 --> 49:16.074
It's just that I'm supposed
to be in Paris and I'm not,

49:16.153 --> 49:19.213
and I'm going out of my mind
with boredom!

49:19.289 --> 49:22.190
I mean, my Sidekick
broke and l...

49:22.259 --> 49:26.423
I haven't had sex
in, like, forever.

49:26.496 --> 49:28.088
And I'm so horny.

49:28.165 --> 49:31.157
I'm horny.

49:31.234 --> 49:33.600
Wait a minute.

49:34.838 --> 49:38.740
- How old are you?
- I'm 22... 20... 19...

49:38.809 --> 49:40.674
I'm... I'm 18.

49:40.744 --> 49:42.644
Eighteen.

49:45.248 --> 49:48.274
So do you really have
my poster on your wall?

49:48.352 --> 49:51.810
- Yeah.
- Do you ever like...

49:51.888 --> 49:53.822
All the time.

49:53.890 --> 49:55.619
How many times in a day?

49:55.692 --> 49:58.320
- Eight.
- Eight?!

50:02.733 --> 50:04.860
Eight? Oh my God,
that's hot.

50:04.935 --> 50:08.371
- You're hot.
- I know, I know.

50:11.174 --> 50:14.007
- Oh, ow.
- Are you okay?

50:14.077 --> 50:16.136
Oh, my back
is killing me.

50:16.213 --> 50:18.681
Oh, I could
give you a massage.

50:18.749 --> 50:21.047
Oh, would you mind?

50:21.118 --> 50:24.053
Not at all.

50:24.121 --> 50:27.682
- Oopsie, I'm naked.
- You're naked.

50:27.758 --> 50:29.817
Do you have any oil?

50:29.893 --> 50:32.418
Right back.

50:37.100 --> 50:38.533
What took you
so long?

50:41.705 --> 50:44.230
- Show me what you've got, baby.
- Okay.

50:44.307 --> 50:46.241
Baby, ooh!

50:46.309 --> 50:48.209
Ooh, more more!

50:50.747 --> 50:52.339
- Okay, enough. Enough!
- Okay.

50:52.416 --> 50:54.884
Oh, yeah.

50:59.389 --> 51:01.220
Hey hey.
Merry Christmas, neighbor.

51:05.829 --> 51:07.524
Gee... hey!

51:07.597 --> 51:09.531
- Ooh, yeah.
- Mikey likey,

51:09.599 --> 51:13.194
- Mikey likey, Mikey likey, Mikey likey...
- Yeah...

51:15.038 --> 51:17.029
Oh! Where the hell
have you been?!

51:17.107 --> 51:18.870
I was getting you food.

51:18.942 --> 51:21.172
- Are you wearing braces?
- It's not braces.

51:21.244 --> 51:24.042
It's a retainer
and it's not that bad.

51:24.114 --> 51:27.743
- Ha, you look like a doofus!
- Doofus!

51:28.885 --> 51:31.285
Doofus! Doofus!

51:31.354 --> 51:34.482
Doofus! Doofus!
Doof...

51:36.193 --> 51:37.820
Chris?

51:37.894 --> 51:40.522
Mommy.

51:40.597 --> 51:43.430
So pretty.

51:43.500 --> 51:46.628
Honey, look what
just came for you.

51:46.703 --> 51:49.467
It's a "Get well soon"
card from Jamie.

51:52.776 --> 51:55.301
- Boo.
- Oh yeah?

51:55.378 --> 51:56.868
What do you
think of that, huh?

51:56.947 --> 51:59.711
It's hugs and kisses, dude.
Mom writes that on my cards.

51:59.783 --> 52:03.048
That's because
I love you both so much.

52:04.521 --> 52:06.318
Thanks, Mommy.

52:14.831 --> 52:16.924
Oh, God.

52:24.107 --> 52:26.575
Truce!

52:27.711 --> 52:29.702
Total pussy.

52:29.779 --> 52:32.714
You're the biggest pussy
on planet Earth.

52:32.782 --> 52:34.875
It's you.

52:37.954 --> 52:40.752
- Hello?
- Jamie!

52:40.824 --> 52:43.918
- Chris! How are you feeling?
- So much better.

52:43.994 --> 52:45.655
Listen, I know
it's Christmas Eve,

52:45.729 --> 52:48.789
- but do you have any plans tonight?
- No.

52:48.865 --> 52:50.662
Well...

52:50.734 --> 52:52.668
the revival theater
in town

52:52.736 --> 52:54.727
is showing Nicholas Sparks's
"The Notebook."

52:54.804 --> 52:56.863
Huh?

52:56.940 --> 52:59.909
- Hello? I'm on the phone.
- Really you want to see "The Notebook"?

52:59.976 --> 53:02.274
Yes, because I love
sentimental tear-jerkers.

53:02.345 --> 53:04.245
I'm gonna friggin' puke.

53:04.314 --> 53:06.111
Just a second.

53:10.820 --> 53:13.345
- You are so dead. Do you hear me?
- Whatever, dude.

53:13.423 --> 53:15.550
- What're you doing over there?
- Faggot.

53:15.625 --> 53:17.354
- Nothing.
- Ooh, that's my call-waiting. One second.

53:17.427 --> 53:18.894
- So, anyway...
- Hello?

53:18.962 --> 53:21.328
- Hey, Jamie. It's Dusty.
- Hey, Dusty.

53:21.398 --> 53:22.558
Hey, listen, just...

53:24.401 --> 53:25.993
Dude, I think
she left you hanging.

53:26.069 --> 53:29.334
It's probably just an important
business call. Get off the phone.

53:29.406 --> 53:32.569
- What, the bar ran out of curly fries?
- Get off the phone.

53:32.642 --> 53:34.701
Dude, are you gonna
boink Jamie tonight?

53:34.778 --> 53:36.769
Yes.
Are you happy now?

53:36.846 --> 53:39.644
All right.

53:39.716 --> 53:42.708
- Dude, "The Notebook"'s so gay.
- Get off the phone!

53:42.786 --> 53:46.278
- Sorry about that.
- That's okay.

53:46.356 --> 53:48.586
- So anyway, what do you say?
- About what?

53:48.658 --> 53:50.592
Going to a movie tonight?
Then maybe later

53:50.660 --> 53:54.061
we can go for some,
uh... herbal tea.

53:54.130 --> 53:56.428
Okay, sure.

53:56.499 --> 53:58.831
Um... You know what?
You're on my way to the theater.

53:58.902 --> 54:00.392
Why don't I pick you up
at like 7:30?

54:00.470 --> 54:01.937
- It's a date.
- Homo.

54:02.005 --> 54:03.734
- Bye for now.
- Bye.

54:07.377 --> 54:10.642
Mom! Mom! Truce!

54:12.515 --> 54:16.781
- Paris, here we come!
- Mm.

54:17.053 --> 54:20.216
- But I'm not ready to play a gig.
- Of course you are.

54:20.290 --> 54:23.225
No. No.

54:23.293 --> 54:24.726
No!

54:24.794 --> 54:29.254
- This is a bad idea, Chris.
- God, I'm so stupid!

54:29.332 --> 54:32.665
- No you're not, baby.
- Here I am, trying to nurture this artist,

54:32.736 --> 54:36.729
yet you're this
pop bubblegum sensation,

54:36.806 --> 54:39.798
and that's okay.

54:39.876 --> 54:41.810
Paris, here we come!

54:43.380 --> 54:46.076
But I am an artist.
I am an artist!

54:46.149 --> 54:48.879
Hey! I am an artist!

54:48.952 --> 54:51.682
- Let's go do this.
- Are you ready for this?

54:51.755 --> 54:54.553
I was born ready, bitch.

54:54.624 --> 54:56.785
- I'm really excited about this.
- Yeah, me too.

54:56.860 --> 54:59.124
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's do this.

54:59.195 --> 55:02.892
Yeah.

55:02.966 --> 55:06.094
- Hey! Wait! You're not coming with me?
- Of course I am.

55:06.169 --> 55:07.796
Mike's just giving you
a ride to the gig.

55:07.871 --> 55:10.305
I'm gonna stay here, I'm gonna do
some administrative work

55:10.373 --> 55:11.965
and I'm gonna
meet you there.

55:12.042 --> 55:13.703
It's open mic night
at The Coffee House.

55:13.777 --> 55:16.109
Coffee House is lame, dude.
Come on...

55:16.179 --> 55:17.703
all right!

55:17.781 --> 55:19.772
Think fast. Boop!

55:19.849 --> 55:21.874
Oh!

55:23.320 --> 55:26.016
Ow!

55:26.089 --> 55:28.023
* And I swear *

55:28.091 --> 55:30.082
- * By the moon and the stars... *
- Jesus.

55:30.160 --> 55:33.493
- * In the skies... *
- Looks like the Michael Bolton starter kit.

55:33.563 --> 55:36.760
* I'll be there *

55:36.833 --> 55:39.666
* And I swear *

55:39.736 --> 55:43.228
* Like a shadow
that's by your side. *

55:43.306 --> 55:45.331
Showtime.

55:56.286 --> 55:58.652
Come on!
How long does it...

56:00.957 --> 56:02.925
- Mistletoe.
- Hello.

56:02.992 --> 56:05.586
- Oh my God!
- Jamie! How are you?

56:05.662 --> 56:08.927
You've grown into such
a beautiful young woman,

56:08.998 --> 56:11.296
hasn't she, Chris?

56:14.270 --> 56:15.965
Ding-dong.

56:17.574 --> 56:19.940
Dusty. Hey. Why?

56:20.009 --> 56:22.500
Are you kidding, man?
I love "The Notebook".

56:22.579 --> 56:24.240
I mean, listen,
I know it might sound

56:24.314 --> 56:26.248
a little corny,
maybe even a little femme,

56:26.316 --> 56:27.977
but I find something
so resplendent

56:28.051 --> 56:30.815
in the simplicity of Nicholas Sparks'
writing, you know what I mean?

56:30.887 --> 56:34.323
Nice outfit, by the way.
Rock and roll.

56:34.391 --> 56:36.222
Carol?

56:36.292 --> 56:38.852
Oh my God.

56:38.928 --> 56:41.089
- Carol...
- Dusty, oh my goodness.

56:41.164 --> 56:43.894
- This is old-home week.
- Oh, absolutely.

56:43.967 --> 56:47.994
- Is it okay that Dusty came?
- Oh, it's awesome that Dusty came.

56:48.071 --> 56:50.062
Thank you.
- Okay.

56:50.140 --> 56:51.869
...in the hospital. We got...
- Dust!

56:51.941 --> 56:54.409
Hey, let's hit the road.

56:54.477 --> 56:56.069
Well, you kids
have fun.

56:56.146 --> 56:57.841
Oh, Carol, why don't
you come join us?

56:57.914 --> 57:00.940
She's vacuuming.

57:01.017 --> 57:04.350
W-well, I'd love to, but l...
I wouldn't want to impose.

57:04.421 --> 57:08.517
- Oh, no imposition at all!
- No.

57:08.591 --> 57:10.684
We'd love to have you,
wouldn't we, Chris?

57:10.760 --> 57:13.854
Yeah, rad.
Awesome.

57:13.930 --> 57:15.693
Mom's coming.
That's good.

57:15.765 --> 57:18.131
- There's a group now.
- Yes!

57:18.201 --> 57:20.795
- It was us. It was us.
- Oh, my darling.

57:20.870 --> 57:23.464
Oh my sweetheart.

57:23.540 --> 57:26.031
I love you so much.

57:32.582 --> 57:36.712
- How much time do we have?
- I'm not sure.

57:36.786 --> 57:39.254
Last time it was no more
than five minutes.

57:41.124 --> 57:43.490
I love you, angel.

57:45.862 --> 57:47.523
What happened to me?

57:47.597 --> 57:49.622
This is so gay.

57:57.273 --> 58:01.004
Oh, Dusty...

58:04.247 --> 58:08.479
Son of a bitch!
Huh?

58:08.551 --> 58:11.645
Peanut.

58:15.391 --> 58:18.417
Oh, no.

58:20.497 --> 58:24.399
* Forgiveness... *

58:24.467 --> 58:26.401
Show us your tits!

58:26.469 --> 58:29.597
- * Is more than saying sorry. *
- Hey! Ashlee Simpson!

58:29.672 --> 58:30.969
Forgive this!

58:32.041 --> 58:33.975
Dusty, what kind
of car is this?

58:34.043 --> 58:37.376
Carol, this little Japanese princess
here is called the Prius.

58:37.447 --> 58:39.176
I think it's so neat
that you kids

58:39.249 --> 58:41.183
care about
the environment.

58:41.251 --> 58:44.846
- I love the environment.
- But honey, don't you drive

58:44.921 --> 58:47.822
a Range Rover?
Aren't those bad?

58:47.891 --> 58:49.984
Well, I had a really
nice time tonight,

58:50.059 --> 58:51.617
and I hope we can
do it again soon.

58:51.694 --> 58:53.821
Hey, Dusty,
thanks for comin'.

58:53.897 --> 58:56.024
Oh, listen, man, it was
my pleasure, really.

58:56.099 --> 58:59.034
Thank you all for having me.
It was so nice.

58:59.102 --> 59:01.161
And hey, before I forget,
make sure

59:01.237 --> 59:03.569
that you rinse that thing
at least twice a day, okay?

59:03.640 --> 59:06.768
Your mouth is
a disgusting open cesspool

59:06.843 --> 59:09.073
with germs and bacteria.
Now put that back!

59:09.145 --> 59:11.306
- Christopher, put that back.
- Put it back!

59:13.016 --> 59:14.483
Thanks.

59:14.551 --> 59:16.576
Hey, anyone want
some cocoa?

59:16.653 --> 59:19.486
Oh, Carol,
you are so sweet!

59:19.556 --> 59:22.491
And I would love to do that,
except I volunteered at the hospital

59:22.559 --> 59:24.584
so that Paul could spend
Christmas Eve with his family.

59:24.661 --> 59:27.357
- So, I kinda gotta get going.
- Aw.

59:27.430 --> 59:29.227
That's a drag. God!

59:29.299 --> 59:31.130
Hey, Jamie,
what about you?

59:33.069 --> 59:35.503
- Ready?
- Give me a Cougar roar. Cougar roar!

59:37.173 --> 59:38.470
Aw.

59:38.541 --> 59:42.272
Cookie Monster says
the Cougars are

59:42.345 --> 59:45.508
great big cookies

59:45.582 --> 59:47.675
at the top of the jar.

59:47.750 --> 59:50.617
Ladies and Gentleman,
the amazing Chris Brander.

59:50.687 --> 59:52.746
Oh my gosh,
I remember this.

59:52.822 --> 59:57.191
He juggles three tennis balls,
but gets bored very quickly

59:57.260 --> 59:59.626
and wants something else.

59:59.696 --> 01:00:03.154
Shh-shh-shh, clear!

01:00:03.232 --> 01:00:05.928
Clear!

01:00:06.002 --> 01:00:08.163
No kissing!

01:00:08.237 --> 01:00:10.569
That's right, Jamie Palamino,

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.665
you're my best friend!

01:00:12.742 --> 01:00:14.676
I love you, Chris Brander.
Mwha!

01:00:14.744 --> 01:00:17.508
Mwha, mwha, mwha!

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:21.346
Oh, your mom's car.
You see, this is more like you.

01:00:21.417 --> 01:00:24.511
Yeah, I'm gonna take it
back to L.A.

01:00:28.024 --> 01:00:30.584
- What?
- Guess what I found?

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:34.255
- No, the tape I made you?
- 1995.

01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:36.855
- "The Summer of Like."
- Put it in.

01:00:38.167 --> 01:00:41.796
* Dun-nun-de-dun
de-dun-dun-dun *

01:00:52.382 --> 01:00:54.646
Oh, God.

01:00:54.717 --> 01:00:56.708
- Oh!
- Oh my God,

01:00:56.786 --> 01:00:58.811
I just peed a little.

01:00:58.888 --> 01:01:02.415
- Good night, guys.
- Good night, Chris.

01:01:06.195 --> 01:01:08.425
What's up?

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:10.329
- Little problem.
- Where are you?

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.197
- The Metal Shop.
- What?!

01:01:12.268 --> 01:01:15.203
Hey! Hey, ow! Ow!

01:01:15.271 --> 01:01:17.330
- That's it, bitch. It's on!
- Come on!

01:01:17.407 --> 01:01:20.968
Ah! I'm gonna kill you!
Not so funny now, bitch, huh?!

01:01:21.044 --> 01:01:23.012
- Not so funny now?!
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

01:01:23.079 --> 01:01:25.980
* Christmas, Christmas,
the happiest day of the year... *

01:01:26.049 --> 01:01:28.074
Kudos on the
Christmas cookies, Mom.

01:01:28.151 --> 01:01:30.449
Thanks, pumpkin.
I'll be back in an hour.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:34.183
* Where sleigh bells ringing
and go jingle-ling *

01:01:34.257 --> 01:01:36.589
* As we're dashing
through the snow *

01:01:38.928 --> 01:01:42.489
* Christmas, Christmas *

01:01:42.565 --> 01:01:45.227
* So, Jesus,
hear our song... *

01:01:45.301 --> 01:01:47.565
- What's up, Dude?
- Quiet, she's sleeping.

01:01:47.637 --> 01:01:49.298
I'm going over
to Jamie's.

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:51.169
- Did you boink her yet?
- Shut it.

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:53.231
If she wakes up,
tell her I went to meet Bono.

01:01:53.309 --> 01:01:55.869
- You're gonna meet Bono? I wanna come.
- No, you walking void,

01:01:55.945 --> 01:01:58.743
it's a lie, but if she wakes up
just tell her I'll be back in a bit.

01:01:58.815 --> 01:02:00.783
- Fine!
- Fine!

01:02:02.185 --> 01:02:03.812
- I love you.
- I love you too.

01:02:12.462 --> 01:02:15.590
* Christmas,
Christmas *

01:02:15.665 --> 01:02:17.997
- * The happiest day of the year *
- Mike!

01:02:20.636 --> 01:02:23.434
Oh, God!

01:02:23.506 --> 01:02:28.500
* Spreading
Christmas cheer *

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:30.512
* We wish you
a Merry Christmas *

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:32.912
* We wish you a Merry Christmas
and a Happy New Year *

01:02:32.982 --> 01:02:35.075
This is pathetic!

01:02:35.151 --> 01:02:39.520
* Good tidings we bring,
to you and your kin *

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:41.614
* Good tidings for Christmas *

01:02:41.691 --> 01:02:43.454
- * And a Happy New Year *
- Oh shit!

01:03:06.682 --> 01:03:08.616
Thank you, guys.
Thank you.

01:03:08.684 --> 01:03:10.618
Encore! Encore!
Encore!

01:03:10.686 --> 01:03:12.620
Okay, all right,
one more time.

01:03:12.688 --> 01:03:15.122
- One more time. Okay.
- Oh yeah!

01:03:15.191 --> 01:03:18.957
Here we go.
You guys, you know,

01:03:19.028 --> 01:03:20.655
Christmas is the time
for giving.

01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:23.028
And the most precious gift
that you can give...

01:03:23.099 --> 01:03:26.296
- is your heart.
- Aww.

01:03:26.369 --> 01:03:28.837
Jamie Palamino,
this is my gift to you.

01:03:28.905 --> 01:03:32.739
* When Jamie smiles *

01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:37.405
* It takes me miles *

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:41.507
* From where I feel unsure *

01:03:43.553 --> 01:03:46.647
* When Jamie smiles *

01:03:46.722 --> 01:03:49.850
* I realize *

01:03:49.926 --> 01:03:54.022
* She's no ordinary girl *

01:03:54.096 --> 01:03:57.691
* Hm-mm-mm... *

01:03:57.767 --> 01:04:00.895
* No ordinary girl *

01:04:00.970 --> 01:04:04.371
* Oh-oh-hhh... *

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:16.379
- Where's Chris?!
- I'll never tell you anything!

01:04:16.452 --> 01:04:19.546
Oh yeah?

01:04:21.824 --> 01:04:25.316
- He's with his lover.
- * Deck the halls with bows of holly *

01:04:25.394 --> 01:04:27.828
* Fa-la-la-la-la
la-la-la-la *

01:04:27.897 --> 01:04:31.333
* 'Tis the season
to be jolly *

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:34.164
* Fa-la-la-la-la
la-la-la-la *

01:04:35.338 --> 01:04:37.772
Dude, Jamie's outside.
What are you doing up here?

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:39.831
I'm getting my butt
kicked by Dinkleman,

01:04:39.909 --> 01:04:41.399
that's what
I'm doing up here.

01:04:41.477 --> 01:04:44.969
You see him play that guitar?
It's like he has 15 fingers.

01:04:45.047 --> 01:04:48.448
Everybody loves him.
I can't compete with this guy.

01:04:48.517 --> 01:04:51.953
You can't compete with this...
are you kidding me?

01:04:52.021 --> 01:04:55.184
You're Chris Brander!
You're Hollywood. You date models!

01:04:55.258 --> 01:04:57.886
He's Jersey.
He skis in his jeans!

01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:59.587
It's Dinkleman.

01:04:59.662 --> 01:05:02.028
It's Dusty Dinkleman.

01:05:03.399 --> 01:05:06.061
- Dinkleman.
- Dinkleman.

01:05:06.135 --> 01:05:08.933
- Dinkleman.
- Dinkleman!

01:05:09.005 --> 01:05:11.997
- Dinkleman.
- Dinkleman's going down.

01:05:12.074 --> 01:05:14.668
Dinkleman...
is going way down.

01:05:14.744 --> 01:05:16.507
Atta boy.

01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:18.945
Now you get out there
and you tell Jamie how you feel!

01:05:19.015 --> 01:05:21.882
- Let's do this.
- Atta boy.

01:05:21.951 --> 01:05:25.546
Good ol' Chris Brander,
ladies and gentlemen!

01:05:25.621 --> 01:05:28.784
*... Iooked down
on the Feast of Stephen *

01:05:28.858 --> 01:05:31.850
* When the snow
lay round about *

01:05:31.928 --> 01:05:34.396
* Deep and crisp
and even *

01:05:34.463 --> 01:05:37.125
* Brightly shone
the moon that night *

01:05:37.199 --> 01:05:39.258
* Though the frost
was cruel *

01:05:41.537 --> 01:05:43.528
What the...

01:05:46.842 --> 01:05:51.040
* It's the most wonderful
time of the year... *

01:05:51.113 --> 01:05:53.240
The jig is up!
Run!

01:05:53.316 --> 01:05:55.284
You son of a bitch!

01:05:55.351 --> 01:05:58.878
Samantha!
You're here! Shit!

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:01.048
There she is.
There's the little slut

01:06:01.123 --> 01:06:02.886
you've been
banging behind my back!

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:05.223
- Me?
- Not you, wrinkles. Her!

01:06:05.294 --> 01:06:07.785
- Who are you?
- Oh...

01:06:07.863 --> 01:06:10.627
- I'm Samantha James, bitch!
- Don't shove me!

01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:13.498
- You're a whore! Santa's little whore!
- Get off!

01:06:13.569 --> 01:06:15.537
- Santa's little whore!
- Cat fight!

01:06:17.206 --> 01:06:19.231
- Get out!
- You're gonna pay for this.

01:06:19.308 --> 01:06:20.866
I'm gonna get you fired!

01:06:20.943 --> 01:06:23.411
Hope you enjoy
unemployment, dickweed!

01:06:23.479 --> 01:06:25.242
Get off me, God boy!

01:06:25.314 --> 01:06:28.511
But Samantha, What about the words
to your song? "Forgiveness"!

01:06:28.584 --> 01:06:31.212
Forgive this, asshole.

01:06:31.287 --> 01:06:33.881
Oh...

01:06:33.956 --> 01:06:36.618
I hate this town!

01:06:36.692 --> 01:06:39.252
Call me.

01:06:48.637 --> 01:06:50.161
- Chris?
- Yeah.

01:06:50.239 --> 01:06:53.731
- Little problem.
- Hm?

01:06:54.810 --> 01:06:56.539
Duck!

01:06:59.949 --> 01:07:03.646
- Ho-ho-ho! Ho-ho!
- No! Not Santa!

01:07:18.801 --> 01:07:20.928
Whoa!
Flaming reindeer.

01:07:25.975 --> 01:07:29.467
Wow! You don't see
that every day.

01:07:31.981 --> 01:07:34.506
Hey Chris, it's Samantha.
I just talked to my sponsor

01:07:34.583 --> 01:07:36.483
and I owe you
an apology.

01:07:36.552 --> 01:07:38.213
It's Samantha...
Call me...

01:07:38.287 --> 01:07:40.050
It's Samantha!

01:07:40.122 --> 01:07:42.955
Hello, Joyce?

01:07:43.025 --> 01:07:45.721
Joyce?

01:07:52.034 --> 01:07:53.968
Go away.

01:07:54.036 --> 01:07:56.197
Go away!

01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:00.204
Mom, I said
I have a tummy ache.

01:08:02.511 --> 01:08:04.502
Well that was
an interesting Christmas.

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:07.242
I'm sorry. I'll pay
for everything.

01:08:07.316 --> 01:08:09.045
I'm not here
to collect.

01:08:09.118 --> 01:08:10.710
What are you doing here?

01:08:10.786 --> 01:08:13.687
I want to talk to the guy
who wrote me this.

01:08:16.325 --> 01:08:18.885
Wow.

01:08:18.961 --> 01:08:23.295
- Mmm... want some more?
- No. Gallon's my limit.

01:08:23.365 --> 01:08:25.629
Oh, excuse me if I'm not
one of your stick models.

01:08:25.701 --> 01:08:28.533
"I'm Chris Brander. I hang out
with Good Charlotte and Pink.

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:31.129
- I go to Jay Z's birthday party..."
- Okay, okay. All right.

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:33.835
- Thank you very much. I get it. I was lame.
- Yeah.

01:08:33.908 --> 01:08:37.709
Actually, I was nervous,
but uh, more importantly,

01:08:37.779 --> 01:08:39.747
does this hat
make me look fat?

01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:46.979
So...

01:08:47.055 --> 01:08:49.957
is your life everything
you'd hoped it'd be?

01:08:50.024 --> 01:08:53.051
I always thought that
if I had a huge career

01:08:53.129 --> 01:08:55.393
and famous clients
and tons of money

01:08:55.464 --> 01:08:57.488
that I'd be happy.

01:08:57.566 --> 01:08:59.591
And the truth is...

01:08:59.667 --> 01:09:01.602
I was right.

01:09:01.670 --> 01:09:04.104
I love it.
Especially the money. Ooh.

01:09:04.173 --> 01:09:07.336
You're so bad!

01:09:07.408 --> 01:09:09.171
What about you?

01:09:09.245 --> 01:09:10.837
Let's put you in
the hot seat, huh?

01:09:10.912 --> 01:09:12.710
Where do you see
yourself in 10 years?

01:09:13.883 --> 01:09:17.341
Um, well, I see
myself teaching.

01:09:17.419 --> 01:09:20.786
And I see myself
getting married

01:09:20.856 --> 01:09:22.448
and raising a family.

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:26.493
What?

01:09:29.698 --> 01:09:32.029
It's gettin' late.

01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:34.501
Why don't I
take you home?

01:09:34.569 --> 01:09:36.504
Or...

01:09:36.572 --> 01:09:38.506
I could sleep over
like old times.

01:09:56.492 --> 01:09:58.187
God.

01:10:03.299 --> 01:10:06.097
- Hi.
- Wow.

01:10:12.841 --> 01:10:14.900
- Ahhh.
- Ahhh.

01:10:14.977 --> 01:10:16.604
- Here we are.
- Yeah.

01:10:16.679 --> 01:10:19.375
Yeah. Hmm.

01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:31.818
This is it.

01:10:31.894 --> 01:10:34.886
You're finally gonna have sex
with Jamie Palamino.

01:10:34.964 --> 01:10:39.230
Oh God, look at that face.
Look at that body.

01:10:39.301 --> 01:10:42.566
Why are you smiling
like a friggin' idiot?

01:10:42.638 --> 01:10:44.970
Go on, make a move.

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:47.201
Make a move!

01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:51.179
What's on your mind?

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:53.112
Bush.

01:10:54.283 --> 01:10:57.309
President Bush,
The First Family, really.

01:11:05.027 --> 01:11:07.894
Dude, you're killing me!

01:11:07.963 --> 01:11:11.160
This is the girl of your
dreams. Ravish her!

01:11:11.233 --> 01:11:13.360
But what if she doesn't
want to be ravished?

01:11:13.435 --> 01:11:15.903
What if she wants to stay friends? Friends
don't ravish each other?

01:11:15.971 --> 01:11:18.269
Friends watch
"New Year's Rockin' Eve."

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:20.035
I wonder who's
hosting this year?

01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:23.340
Chris, can you put your feet on mine?
They're freezing.

01:11:23.412 --> 01:11:25.073
Yeah.

01:11:25.147 --> 01:11:27.240
Hell yeah.
Her feet aren't even cold.

01:11:27.316 --> 01:11:29.181
This is it.

01:11:29.251 --> 01:11:32.550
Don't even think about
how weird tomorrow's gonna be.

01:11:35.758 --> 01:11:39.785
- Chris.
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:11:39.862 --> 01:11:42.387
What're you doing?
Where're you going?

01:11:42.464 --> 01:11:44.830
- Is everything all right?
- Oh, everything's fine.

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:47.596
Yeah. You okay? Uh, you need
another blanket or anything?

01:11:47.670 --> 01:11:49.331
- No, I'm fine.
- Ah.

01:11:49.405 --> 01:11:52.533
You're not gonna make
a move, are you?

01:11:52.608 --> 01:11:55.236
- Good night, Jamie.
- Good night, Chris.

01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:58.109
You don't deserve a penis.

01:12:00.382 --> 01:12:02.145
God, and we had
this great night

01:12:02.217 --> 01:12:04.242
and we were laughing

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.754
and we were showing each other
old pictures and...

01:12:06.822 --> 01:12:08.722
- Did he try anything?
- No!

01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:12.158
- Did you try anything?
- No, but I put myself out there.

01:12:12.227 --> 01:12:14.559
I mean, I wore
the sexy white shirt

01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:18.122
and I did the whole cold-feet move
and we slept in the same bed.

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:20.930
What the hell is wrong with you?
I mean, why didn't you sleep with her?

01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:22.868
- Oh, I know. I had her.
- I mean, are you two

01:12:22.938 --> 01:12:24.929
on the same menstrual
cycle yet or what?

01:12:25.007 --> 01:12:28.704
I don't know,
I don't know, I don't know.

01:12:28.777 --> 01:12:31.109
Maybe I just don't compare
to these L.A. Girls.

01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:33.444
Look, the timing just
wasn't right, you know?

01:12:33.515 --> 01:12:37.918
I'm... I'm laying there.
I'm about to make my move

01:12:37.986 --> 01:12:40.352
and then suddenly
it just hits me.

01:12:40.422 --> 01:12:42.356
Where's this going?

01:12:42.424 --> 01:12:44.449
What happens after
we sleep together?

01:12:44.526 --> 01:12:46.517
Does she move to L.A.?
Do I move back here?

01:12:46.595 --> 01:12:49.564
Jesus, Dude. I thought you just
wanted to sleep with her.

01:12:49.631 --> 01:12:52.191
Maybe he just wants
to be friends.

01:12:52.267 --> 01:12:54.963
Maybe he's gay.

01:12:55.037 --> 01:12:57.562
I can't just sleep with Jamie Palamino.
We have a history.

01:12:57.639 --> 01:12:59.766
- We're... we're... we're... we're...
- Friends.

01:13:01.810 --> 01:13:03.744
God damn it!

01:13:03.812 --> 01:13:05.973
I'm right back in high school again,
you know?

01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:09.745
I gotta follow my own advice.
I gotta just walk away.

01:13:09.818 --> 01:13:11.251
No, put me on the 3:00.

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:13.254
The sooner I get out
of here, the better.

01:13:13.322 --> 01:13:16.189
- You sure about this?
- No.

01:13:16.258 --> 01:13:18.783
* When Janice
smiles... *

01:13:18.861 --> 01:13:21.796
- Janice?
- * I realize *

01:13:21.864 --> 01:13:24.924
* She's no ordinary *

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.026
* Girl. *

01:13:35.177 --> 01:13:37.441
Hey listen.
I gotta hang out

01:13:37.513 --> 01:13:39.276
with my friends
over there, okay?

01:13:39.348 --> 01:13:42.249
- I'll talk to you tonight.
- Whoo!

01:13:44.019 --> 01:13:47.284
- What's up, homies?
- You tell me.

01:13:47.356 --> 01:13:49.187
- What's with the nurse?
- Oh, Janice.

01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:51.692
Oof, another bee
in the hive, my friend,

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:54.786
- just another bee.
- Well, what about Jamie?

01:13:54.863 --> 01:13:56.626
What about her? I mean, hey,

01:13:56.698 --> 01:13:59.189
it's great, right? Two biggest
geeks back in the day

01:13:59.268 --> 01:14:01.463
now finally have a shot with the hottest
chick in high school?

01:14:01.537 --> 01:14:04.301
- You can't write that stuff, my friend.
- Hey, are you kidding me?

01:14:04.373 --> 01:14:06.967
Oh, come on, man.
Cut the nice guy routine.

01:14:07.042 --> 01:14:09.203
I know what you're up to
and I am all for it.

01:14:09.278 --> 01:14:11.712
I mean it is gonna be
sweet revenge on Jamie Palamino

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:13.748
for keeping us in the friend zone
all those years.

01:14:13.816 --> 01:14:16.410
Oh, yeah, you wish you were
in the friend zone.

01:14:16.485 --> 01:14:18.783
I was in the friend zone.
Friend zone's mine.

01:14:18.854 --> 01:14:21.721
- Dusty, popcorn's ready.
- Copy that, I'm mobile.

01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:23.553
- Listen, I gotta run.
- The man's juice!

01:14:23.625 --> 01:14:25.559
You guys have a nice time.
It's been nice seeing you.

01:14:25.627 --> 01:14:28.790
Have fun with Jamie. I know I will.
Clark, always a pleasure.

01:14:28.864 --> 01:14:30.855
- Dinkleman.
- Son of a bitch.

01:14:32.835 --> 01:14:35.030
So we're looking at
day cares.

01:14:35.103 --> 01:14:37.628
And Darla's got this one picked
out for TJ and it's great.

01:14:37.706 --> 01:14:40.266
And you know, don't get me wrong,
I want the best for my kid.

01:14:40.342 --> 01:14:42.173
I mean he deserves
the best

01:14:42.244 --> 01:14:45.873
but Tiny Tots is just too...
oh, Mariah Carey!

01:14:49.651 --> 01:14:51.585
What the hell
are you doing?!

01:14:51.653 --> 01:14:54.213
This is a
Pontiac Grand Prix!

01:14:54.289 --> 01:14:56.223
I'm sorry, okay?!

01:14:56.291 --> 01:14:58.987
But I can't let Dinkleman
get away with this!

01:14:59.061 --> 01:15:02.792
I refuse to sit back and let Jamie
get used by another asshole!

01:15:02.865 --> 01:15:06.323
You could've asked!
L.A. Guys are so dramatic.

01:15:06.401 --> 01:15:08.869
- I'm sorry!
- Okay.

01:15:11.173 --> 01:15:15.041
- * Christmas, Christmas... *
- Oh my God.

01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:18.238
You know, one good snowfall
and you won't see any of this.

01:15:18.313 --> 01:15:22.306
* Where sleigh bells ringing
and go jingle-ling *

01:15:22.384 --> 01:15:25.717
* Spreading
Christmas cheer. *

01:15:25.787 --> 01:15:27.880
Hi, Mr. Palamino.
How are you?

01:15:27.956 --> 01:15:30.254
Come to destroy
the rest of the house, huh?

01:15:30.325 --> 01:15:33.021
Look, I'm really sorry
about yesterday.

01:15:33.095 --> 01:15:36.656
- Ho-ho-ho.
- And that.

01:15:36.732 --> 01:15:39.724
Look, I know you hate me, but I need
to speak with Jamie. Where is she?

01:15:39.801 --> 01:15:42.702
- She's gone off with Mr. Lee.
- Dry cleaner?

01:15:42.771 --> 01:15:46.070
- No. Dusty, you jackass.
- Where are they?

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:59.385
- * I've been workin' on the railroad... *
- No, Chris! This way.

01:15:59.454 --> 01:16:02.787
* All the livelong day *

01:16:02.858 --> 01:16:05.986
* I've been workin'
on the railroad *

01:16:06.061 --> 01:16:09.792
* Just to pass
the time away *

01:16:09.865 --> 01:16:13.596
* Can't you hear
the whistle blowing?

01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:16.661
* Rise so early
in the morn' *

01:16:16.738 --> 01:16:20.196
- Dinkleman!
- * Can't you hear the captain shouting? *

01:16:20.275 --> 01:16:22.903
- Chris, what're you doing here?
- I need to talk to you.

01:16:26.481 --> 01:16:27.573
Dusty!

01:16:28.884 --> 01:16:29.976
Yes!

01:16:32.387 --> 01:16:34.184
- I really need to speak with you!
- This next number

01:16:34.256 --> 01:16:36.884
- is for your favorite teacher and mine.
- Let's go.

01:16:36.959 --> 01:16:39.086
She put this wonderful concert
together for all of us.

01:16:39.161 --> 01:16:42.289
Give a big round of applause
to Miss Jamie Palamino.

01:16:44.366 --> 01:16:47.460
* When Jamie smiles *

01:16:47.536 --> 01:16:49.697
* It takes me miles *

01:16:52.007 --> 01:16:53.269
* From where I've... *

01:16:53.342 --> 01:16:55.742
God, I still can't believe
he wrote me that song.

01:16:55.811 --> 01:16:58.871
Oh I can. He's been working on that song
since high school, remember?

01:16:58.947 --> 01:17:00.710
It's like the stalker's
national anthem.

01:17:00.782 --> 01:17:03.012
Not to mention I already heard
that song today,

01:17:03.085 --> 01:17:05.110
only it was Janice's eyes
that made him smile.

01:17:05.187 --> 01:17:07.985
- Janice? Who's Janice?
- A nurse with really big boobs

01:17:08.056 --> 01:17:11.457
that works at the medical center. A girl
I saw him kissing earlier tonight.

01:17:11.526 --> 01:17:14.154
Dusty's a Jersey player,
Jamie!

01:17:14.229 --> 01:17:15.628
He's out
for revenge on you

01:17:15.697 --> 01:17:17.665
for putting him in the friend zone
in high school.

01:17:17.733 --> 01:17:19.462
What are you
talking about?

01:17:19.534 --> 01:17:21.502
The guy's looking
for the anger bang!

01:17:21.570 --> 01:17:24.505
Amazing! That's exactly
what he said about you.

01:17:24.573 --> 01:17:26.768
- Don't you see what's happening here?
- Oh, I don't know.

01:17:26.842 --> 01:17:29.037
The guy's just
out-playing me, that's all.

01:17:29.111 --> 01:17:31.272
Oh, it's about you!
Now he's out-playing you!

01:17:31.346 --> 01:17:33.280
- W-what am I, a game?
- No!

01:17:33.348 --> 01:17:35.111
Would you guys like
to join us in a carol

01:17:35.183 --> 01:17:37.879
- to celebrate the birth of our Lord?
- No!

01:17:42.190 --> 01:17:45.990
My God, don't!
Dusty! Don't!

01:17:46.061 --> 01:17:48.427
- Dinkleman!
- What is the matter with you?

01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:50.488
This is a Christmas
concert for children!

01:17:50.565 --> 01:17:53.125
- You liar!
- Suckster's not your boyfriend, is he?

01:17:53.201 --> 01:17:56.602
- No, he's not!
- 'Cause we like Dusty.

01:17:56.672 --> 01:17:58.833
Dusty! Dusty!
Dusty! Dusty!

01:17:58.907 --> 01:18:00.636
- Ugh!
- Dusty! Dusty! Dusty...!

01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:02.472
Oooh!

01:18:02.544 --> 01:18:05.035
I'm being framed!
I'm being framed!

01:18:06.314 --> 01:18:09.340
- Dusty!
- Dinkleman!

01:18:09.418 --> 01:18:12.387
Man, when you come back to town,
you come back to town!

01:18:12.454 --> 01:18:16.185
Huh? Huh?
Look, don't sweat it.

01:18:16.258 --> 01:18:18.283
W-w-we'll go
to The Maple tonight

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:19.987
You can apologize
to Jamie

01:18:20.062 --> 01:18:23.520
and everything will be just...
just peachy.

01:18:23.598 --> 01:18:25.896
Okay, yep, good.
Thanks, Clark, for everything.

01:18:25.967 --> 01:18:28.367
See you in another 10 years.
Guess not.

01:18:30.572 --> 01:18:32.972
How'd it go with Jamie last night?
You boink her?

01:18:33.041 --> 01:18:35.373
That would be a no.

01:18:35.444 --> 01:18:37.708
Raise you hand
if your brother's a homo!

01:18:39.047 --> 01:18:41.447
All right.
Keep in touch!

01:18:45.887 --> 01:18:50.187
You believe that?
Not one taxi, not one.

01:18:50.258 --> 01:18:52.726
Stupid town.
I gotta take the bus!

01:18:52.794 --> 01:18:54.386
Dude, bus sucks!

01:18:56.031 --> 01:18:59.057
Yes!
I am outta here!

01:19:00.902 --> 01:19:04.736
So long, Sucktown!
Kiss my ass!

01:19:06.374 --> 01:19:08.808
Hey, Mr. Bus Driver Man.

01:19:08.877 --> 01:19:10.538
Hey...

01:19:10.612 --> 01:19:14.104
pull my finger.
Come on, pull my finger.

01:19:36.671 --> 01:19:40.072
- Aw!
- Yoo-hoo!

01:19:40.142 --> 01:19:43.578
- Great.
- Jamie!

01:19:43.645 --> 01:19:46.273
- Whoa, miss, miss. W-w-whoa.
- What? What, what, wha...

01:19:46.348 --> 01:19:48.612
- what, Chris? What do you want?
- I just want to apologize.

01:19:48.683 --> 01:19:50.548
I'm sorry.
I was out of line, okay?

01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:52.951
- You're an asshole.
- Oh, my... I was...

01:19:53.021 --> 01:19:55.512
Hey, I'm gonna get you a cab
and take you home, huh?

01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:58.718
- She's so sensitive!
- You blew it. I'm winning.

01:19:58.794 --> 01:20:01.058
- You're the Devil.
- So go ahead, just go sleep it off.

01:20:01.129 --> 01:20:03.120
You'll be right as rain
in the morning, brother.

01:20:03.198 --> 01:20:06.065
Chris, you're drunk!
Go home!

01:20:06.134 --> 01:20:08.659
I'm not drunk.
What's this?

01:20:09.704 --> 01:20:13.105
Ooh.
"Simply Dusty"

01:20:13.175 --> 01:20:15.166
Is there any other kind?
That's adorable.

01:20:15.243 --> 01:20:17.177
Do you know what else
is adorable? You two.

01:20:17.245 --> 01:20:20.112
Hey! Stop bringing Dusty
into your problems, okay?

01:20:20.182 --> 01:20:22.116
Dusty and I are fine.

01:20:22.184 --> 01:20:24.778
- Dusty and I are friends.
- Right!

01:20:24.853 --> 01:20:27.617
- Not for too long, I hope.
- Yeah...

01:20:27.689 --> 01:20:29.122
Wait, what?

01:20:29.191 --> 01:20:31.022
Slow down.
What did you just say?

01:20:31.092 --> 01:20:33.287
Jamie, listen, I've been
meaning to talk to you.

01:20:33.361 --> 01:20:35.295
L... about our
relationship.

01:20:35.363 --> 01:20:37.923
Maybe we could take
the next step or something?

01:20:37.999 --> 01:20:39.466
Dusty, can I be honest with you?

01:20:39.534 --> 01:20:42.162
- I think you're a really nice guy.
- Thank you.

01:20:42.237 --> 01:20:44.501
I think you're funny
and charming and sweet,

01:20:44.573 --> 01:20:47.565
and I just don't have
those feelings for you.

01:20:47.642 --> 01:20:49.507
- You're kidding.
- No.

01:20:49.578 --> 01:20:54.038
Whew!

01:20:54.115 --> 01:20:57.209
Okay, 'cause... cause I wrote you
that song and everything,

01:20:57.285 --> 01:20:59.116
you know, and I worked
really hard on it

01:20:59.187 --> 01:21:01.451
and what kind of girl would you be if you
didn't put out for the guy that wrote

01:21:01.523 --> 01:21:03.514
- you that song, you know what mean?
- Huh?

01:21:05.961 --> 01:21:08.429
F-this. I'm mobile.

01:21:09.664 --> 01:21:11.632
Ah-ha!

01:21:14.035 --> 01:21:16.299
I'm gonna miss him!

01:21:16.371 --> 01:21:17.998
- Oh!
- Ow!

01:21:18.073 --> 01:21:20.507
- What? Heh.
- Eh!

01:21:23.078 --> 01:21:25.012
Get off me, Chris!
Why are you here?

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:26.775
Why do you keep
messing with my head?

01:21:26.848 --> 01:21:28.839
I messed with your head
for three days.

01:21:28.917 --> 01:21:31.886
You've been torturing me
since the sixth grade!

01:21:31.953 --> 01:21:33.716
So that's what
this is about?

01:21:33.788 --> 01:21:36.552
Because I wouldn't screw you
in high school? Get over yourself!

01:21:36.625 --> 01:21:40.026
Oh, after years of you
being the biggest tease,

01:21:40.095 --> 01:21:42.655
trust me,
I'm so over myself.

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:44.358
Oh, so now
I'm the tease.

01:21:44.432 --> 01:21:45.956
I practically
throw myself at you

01:21:46.034 --> 01:21:47.626
the other night
and you did nothing!

01:21:47.702 --> 01:21:51.263
And now you know
how it feels.

01:21:51.339 --> 01:21:53.204
I'm outta here.

01:21:53.275 --> 01:21:55.573
Yeah, there you go.
Just walk away like you always do!

01:21:55.644 --> 01:21:57.305
Oh, no no no.
I'm-I'm not walking away.

01:21:57.379 --> 01:21:59.404
I'm running back
to my great life in L.A.!

01:21:59.481 --> 01:22:01.881
- Great. Well, have fun.
- Oh, you have fun...

01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:04.145
being the girl
who peaked in high school.

01:22:04.219 --> 01:22:07.154
- Ooohh!
- You slap like a cheerleader.

01:22:07.222 --> 01:22:09.349
Bye, Chris.

01:22:11.226 --> 01:22:13.194
And stay out!

01:22:18.266 --> 01:22:19.893
I've always wanted
to say that.

01:23:30.305 --> 01:23:31.795
How did you
get in here?

01:23:31.873 --> 01:23:34.171
My bodyguard
let me in.

01:23:34.242 --> 01:23:36.870
I was making cookies.

01:23:36.945 --> 01:23:38.606
Oh, I was trying
to be all domesticated

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:40.910
like that skank you were
banging behind my back.

01:23:40.982 --> 01:23:42.472
Please leave me alone.

01:23:43.551 --> 01:23:45.485
No, sh-sh-sh-sh!

01:23:45.553 --> 01:23:47.180
Hugs and kisses!

01:23:47.255 --> 01:23:50.554
It's all good, baby,
it's all good.

01:23:50.625 --> 01:23:53.685
By making me jealous on purpose
you inspire me to write the best songs,

01:23:53.762 --> 01:23:55.491
you know,
full of angst and hate!

01:23:55.563 --> 01:23:58.293
You like that.
You and I are gonna be

01:23:58.366 --> 01:24:00.357
the greatest musical
manager team

01:24:00.435 --> 01:24:02.767
since Jessica Simpson
and her father...

01:24:02.837 --> 01:24:04.862
only we get to "mreow"
and they can't,

01:24:04.939 --> 01:24:07.407
'cause it's illegal.
I looked it up.

01:24:07.475 --> 01:24:11.070
This is the new and improved
"Forgiveness."

01:24:17.152 --> 01:24:20.883
* Forgiveness *

01:24:20.955 --> 01:24:24.118
* Is more than
sayin' sorry *

01:24:24.192 --> 01:24:26.626
Are you sorry?
Ha ha!

01:24:28.396 --> 01:24:30.330
* Forgiveness. *

01:24:33.001 --> 01:24:34.696
- No.
- No?

01:24:34.769 --> 01:24:37.704
- No more.
- But I've forgiven you!

01:24:37.772 --> 01:24:39.899
- It's just like the song...
- Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh...

01:24:39.974 --> 01:24:43.273
This isn't about you.

01:24:43.344 --> 01:24:45.710
It's cool, you can have other girls.
I like girls.

01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:47.577
Darla!

01:24:47.649 --> 01:24:49.776
I don't want other girls.

01:24:49.851 --> 01:24:51.443
I want one girl.

01:24:52.787 --> 01:24:54.812
- That's not you.
- Hmph.

01:25:00.428 --> 01:25:01.895
Look.
I'll call...

01:25:04.799 --> 01:25:06.266
Ouch.

01:25:10.305 --> 01:25:12.637
- Why don't you like me?
- It's a little hard to answer

01:25:12.707 --> 01:25:14.641
with a taser in my balls!

01:25:14.709 --> 01:25:17.473
This is about Santa's
little whore, isn't it?

01:25:21.149 --> 01:25:23.117
Ooh yeah,
it's go time.

01:25:23.184 --> 01:25:24.481
Hey, hey, hey!
It's not go time!

01:25:24.552 --> 01:25:26.486
This isn't how it works,
Samantha.

01:25:26.554 --> 01:25:30.012
You can't force or-or torture
someone into liking you.

01:25:30.091 --> 01:25:31.649
Ooh, the big speech.

01:25:31.726 --> 01:25:33.455
No! You just have to put
yourself out there

01:25:33.528 --> 01:25:34.460
and hope that they
like you back.

01:25:34.529 --> 01:25:36.588
This isn't a game!
This is my life!

01:25:36.664 --> 01:25:38.529
Oh, yeah, well,
this is my life!

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:40.465
Okay? I'm sorry.

01:25:40.535 --> 01:25:43.561
I'm not the most
boring person ever!

01:25:43.638 --> 01:25:45.333
Okay? I'm sorry
I'm not poor!

01:25:46.374 --> 01:25:48.137
I'm sorry...

01:25:48.209 --> 01:25:51.542
I'm sorry I don't
have a fat ass!

01:25:51.613 --> 01:25:54.309
I'm sorry I'm not...
where're you going?

01:25:54.382 --> 01:25:59.012
* Missed the last
train home *

01:26:02.490 --> 01:26:07.894
* Birds pass by to tell me
that I'm not alone *

01:26:07.962 --> 01:26:11.295
* Well, I'm pushing myself
to finish this part... *

01:26:11.366 --> 01:26:12.890
Hey! Hey,
where is she?

01:26:12.967 --> 01:26:17.700
* I handle a lot
walking on this *

01:26:17.772 --> 01:26:20.969
* It's in your eyes,
open your eyes *

01:26:21.042 --> 01:26:24.910
* Open eyes,
open your eyes *

01:26:24.979 --> 01:26:26.674
* Open your eyes *

01:26:26.748 --> 01:26:28.613
* Open your eyes. *

01:26:28.683 --> 01:26:30.617
Hi.

01:26:30.685 --> 01:26:32.880
Jamie.
Look, Jamie!

01:26:34.722 --> 01:26:36.815
I said a lot of really crappy
things the other night

01:26:36.891 --> 01:26:39.860
and I'm sorry about that.

01:26:39.928 --> 01:26:42.396
I haven't been a very good friend
to you and I'm sorry, okay?

01:26:42.463 --> 01:26:46.456
I just... the truth is
I'm-I'm afraid to be your friend

01:26:46.534 --> 01:26:48.399
'cause I'm always
gonna want more.

01:26:49.504 --> 01:26:51.165
But then I got
to thinking that-that

01:26:51.239 --> 01:26:54.003
I'd rather have you in my life
as a friend than not at all.

01:26:57.412 --> 01:26:59.346
You know what?
That's a lie too.

01:27:03.718 --> 01:27:05.549
Why are you back here?

01:27:07.522 --> 01:27:09.353
Because I want
to take you on a date.

01:27:11.359 --> 01:27:14.157
And I don't care if it's
in the day or at night

01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:17.596
or whenever, as long
as it's a real date.

01:27:17.665 --> 01:27:20.930
And I want to tell you how beautiful
I think you are inside and out.

01:27:22.036 --> 01:27:24.231
And I want to have
babies with you

01:27:24.305 --> 01:27:27.331
and I want to marry you
and I love you.

01:27:28.743 --> 01:27:30.836
Jamie, I always have.

01:27:34.482 --> 01:27:36.882
Mmm. Ow!

01:27:36.951 --> 01:27:39.078
Sorry. Just, uh...

01:27:39.153 --> 01:27:41.121
20 years all at once!

01:28:03.411 --> 01:28:04.435
Unbelievable!

01:28:04.512 --> 01:28:06.571
Suckster's making out
with Mrs. P!

01:28:06.648 --> 01:28:08.843
What is she thinking?

01:28:08.916 --> 01:28:12.044
- Hey, Sarah, do you want my last cookie?
- Oh, thanks, Brett!

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:14.247
Hey, Joey, do you want
some of my cookie?

01:28:14.322 --> 01:28:15.914
Don't mind if I do.

01:28:15.990 --> 01:28:19.153
- You're such a good friend, Brett.
- The bestest!

01:28:19.227 --> 01:28:20.524
Ahh.

01:28:20.595 --> 01:28:21.391
Oh, shit!

01:28:21.729 --> 01:28:24.357
* I swear *

01:28:24.432 --> 01:28:27.367
* By the moon
and the stars *

01:28:27.435 --> 01:28:30.233
* In the skies *

01:28:30.305 --> 01:28:33.103
* I'll be there *

01:28:33.174 --> 01:28:35.836
* And I swear *

01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:37.969
* Like the shadow *

01:28:38.046 --> 01:28:41.948
* That's by your side *

01:28:42.016 --> 01:28:45.383
* I'll be there *

01:28:45.453 --> 01:28:48.581
* For better or worse *

01:28:48.656 --> 01:28:51.557
* Till death
do us part *

01:28:51.626 --> 01:28:56.723
* I'll love you with every
beat of my heart *

01:28:56.798 --> 01:29:00.290
* And I swear *

01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:05.398
* Oh-hh *

01:29:06.607 --> 01:29:10.441
* Hahh-aah... *

01:29:10.511 --> 01:29:14.072
* I'll give you
everything *

01:29:14.148 --> 01:29:16.275
* I can *

01:29:16.351 --> 01:29:18.216
* I'll build your dreams *

01:29:18.286 --> 01:29:21.847
* With these two hands *

01:29:21.923 --> 01:29:24.653
* We'll hang
some memories *

01:29:24.726 --> 01:29:28.492
* On the walls *

01:29:28.563 --> 01:29:31.031
- * And when *
- * And when *

01:29:31.099 --> 01:29:36.036
* Just the two
of us are there *

01:29:36.104 --> 01:29:38.402
* You won't
have to ask *

01:29:38.473 --> 01:29:42.068
* If I still care *

01:29:42.143 --> 01:29:45.704
* 'Cause as the time
turns the page *

01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:50.945
* My love won't age
at all *

01:29:51.018 --> 01:29:54.112
- * And I swear *
- * And I swear *

01:29:54.188 --> 01:29:57.021
* By the moon
and the stars *

01:29:57.091 --> 01:29:59.821
* In the skies *

01:29:59.894 --> 01:30:02.920
- * I'll be there *
- * I'll be there *

01:30:02.997 --> 01:30:05.591
- * And I swear *
- * And I swear *

01:30:05.666 --> 01:30:11.298
* Like the shadow
that's by your side *

01:30:11.372 --> 01:30:14.967
- * I'll be there *
- * I'll be there *

01:30:15.042 --> 01:30:17.806
* For better
or worse *

01:30:17.879 --> 01:30:20.643
* Till death
do us part *

01:30:20.715 --> 01:30:26.051
* I'll love you with
every beat of my heart *

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:29.783
- * And I swear *
- * Oh, yeah *

01:30:40.401 --> 01:30:42.869
* And I swear *

01:30:42.937 --> 01:30:45.997
* By the moon
and the stars *

01:30:46.073 --> 01:30:48.564

01:30:48.643 --> 01:30:51.635
- * I'll be there *
- * I'll be there *

01:30:51.712 --> 01:30:54.306
* And I swear *

01:30:54.382 --> 01:30:56.407
* Like the shadow *

01:30:56.484 --> 01:31:00.352
- * That's by your side *
- * That's by your side *

01:31:00.421 --> 01:31:03.652
- * I'll be there *
- * I'll be there *

01:31:03.724 --> 01:31:07.091

01:31:07.161 --> 01:31:09.959
- * Till death do us part *
- * Oh no *

01:31:10.031 --> 01:31:15.196
* I'll love you with
every beat of my heart *

01:31:15.269 --> 01:31:18.261
* And I swear *

01:31:18.339 --> 01:31:21.399
* I swear *

01:31:21.476 --> 01:31:26.311
* Oh, whoa, I... *

01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:29.508
* Swear. *

01:31:29.584 --> 01:31:30.608
Mike!

01:31:40.361 --> 01:31:43.455
* Forgiveness *

01:31:44.699 --> 01:31:48.100
* Is more than
saying sorry *

01:31:48.169 --> 01:31:52.128
* Sorry sorry sorry *

01:31:52.206 --> 01:31:56.336
* Forgiveness *

01:31:56.410 --> 01:32:00.278
* Means accepting
people's flaws *

01:32:00.348 --> 01:32:05.285
* Flaws flaws flaws *

01:32:05.353 --> 01:32:07.844
* To forgive is divine *

01:32:07.922 --> 01:32:11.449
* So let's have
a glass of wine *

01:32:11.526 --> 01:32:14.120
* And have makeup sex *

01:32:14.195 --> 01:32:16.129
* Until the end of *

01:32:16.197 --> 01:32:19.132
* Time *

01:32:22.570 --> 01:32:26.836
* Forgiveness *

01:32:26.908 --> 01:32:30.344
* Does not mean
compromising *

01:32:34.882 --> 01:32:37.680
* Let's forgive
and forget *

01:32:37.752 --> 01:32:40.880
* And solve this
African debt *

01:32:40.955 --> 01:32:43.924
* Just like
the Cheshire Cat *

01:32:43.991 --> 01:32:47.392
* Who says, "Mreow!
You're running out of time!" *

01:32:47.461 --> 01:32:52.489
* Time time time time time,
wreeow! *

01:33:19.226 --> 01:33:20.716
* Forgiveness *

01:33:20.795 --> 01:33:22.660
You'll always be
fat to me, Chris!

01:33:25.566 --> 01:33:26.965
* Forgiveness *

01:33:27.034 --> 01:33:29.594
God damn it!
Come on, Dusty.

01:33:31.639 --> 01:33:33.573
* Forgiveness *

01:33:33.641 --> 01:33:36.075
Not happy!

01:33:37.645 --> 01:33:39.636
* Forgiveness *

01:33:39.714 --> 01:33:44.651
Hello, Joyce? Joyce?

01:33:44.719 --> 01:33:46.619
Oh my God!

01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:52.850
Then said Jesus,
"Father, forgive them

01:33:52.927 --> 01:33:56.124
for they know
not what they do."

01:33:56.197 --> 01:33:59.894
If you haven't forgiven yourself
something, how can you forgive others?

01:33:59.967 --> 01:34:01.491
I won't apologize.

01:34:01.569 --> 01:34:03.366
I don't forgive you.

01:34:03.437 --> 01:34:06.463
You can forgive,
but you can't forget.

01:34:07.708 --> 01:34:09.676
Where are you?

01:34:14.081 --> 01:34:16.811
* Forgiveness *

01:34:18.719 --> 01:34:21.210
Time time time time

01:34:21.288 --> 01:34:23.779
time time time time.
