WEBVTT

00:15.208 --> 00:17.416
-Whoa!

00:19.500 --> 00:21.250
Ah!

00:26.958 --> 00:28.458
-Ah! No!
-Huh?

00:30.583 --> 00:31.416
Ah!

00:32.541 --> 00:33.458
Ouch!

00:46.125 --> 00:47.916
-Hey.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.916
Ding dong!

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Anyone in there? Hello?

01:12.083 --> 01:13.916
Temeluchus, your majesty.

01:15.083 --> 01:18.208
Hi, it's me, Pugsley, the talking dog.

01:18.291 --> 01:19.791
No, no, I don't need you.

01:19.875 --> 01:21.458
I need who's inside you.

01:22.833 --> 01:23.791
Wait.

01:25.916 --> 01:29.208
They say the eyes
are the window to the soul.

01:32.000 --> 01:32.833
Be right back.

01:34.083 --> 01:37.541
Hey, Patrick, happy birthday
to the best little brother in the world.

01:37.625 --> 01:39.166
Sorry I can't be there.

01:39.250 --> 01:42.125
-No! Too sucky. Too rusty.
-Sorry I haven't been there.

01:42.208 --> 01:44.458
Sorry I haven't been
the greatest big brother.

01:45.458 --> 01:46.291
Not rusty enough.

01:46.375 --> 01:47.958
And I live in a theme park now.

01:48.916 --> 01:49.916
Are you ready?

01:50.000 --> 01:50.833
Oh, yeah.

01:50.916 --> 01:51.958
I was just, uh…

01:52.500 --> 01:53.875
Uh, what's with the bag?

01:53.958 --> 01:55.333
It's only an overnight shift.

01:55.416 --> 01:57.750
Oh, just a few Pauline Phoenix
horror movies.

01:57.833 --> 02:00.875
My favorite is…
<i>The Night Hag.</i>

02:01.416 --> 02:04.333
Norma, these kids are like eight.
Won't that give them nightmares?

02:04.416 --> 02:07.333
These are for me to watch.
I don't care what the kids get up to.

02:12.458 --> 02:13.541
Perfect.

02:13.625 --> 02:16.458
Now, which eye is your favorite
and I'll start with the other.

02:19.833 --> 02:23.416
Guys, wait for me, wait for me. Gu--

02:30.541 --> 02:32.541
Kids these days are so lucky.

02:32.625 --> 02:34.416
I'd have given anything
for a sleepover party

02:34.500 --> 02:36.458
at a dinosaur restaurant in a theme park?

02:37.000 --> 02:38.625
I'd have given anything to avoid that.

02:39.208 --> 02:40.500
This is gonna be the worst.

02:40.583 --> 02:41.791
It's just a few kids.

02:42.333 --> 02:43.375
How bad could it be?

02:44.791 --> 02:45.750
Wow.

02:46.250 --> 02:49.125
-Whoo-hoo! Guys, check it out! Follow me.

02:49.791 --> 02:50.791
Wow.

02:50.875 --> 02:52.750
Hey, Barney, Norma.

02:52.833 --> 02:54.750
Thanks for saving us at such short notice.

02:54.833 --> 02:56.208
No problem. How've they been?

02:56.291 --> 02:58.500
They ate loads of sugar,
told ghost stories,

02:58.583 --> 03:01.416
and now they're pretending
to be dinosaurs.

03:03.125 --> 03:04.666
There's no chance they're going to sleep.

03:04.750 --> 03:06.000
Great.

03:06.083 --> 03:07.666
Here's the birthday cake.

03:07.750 --> 03:10.083
And here is the list
of emergency contacts,

03:10.166 --> 03:15.583
and extra blankets, and a first aid kit,
and some more blankets.

03:15.666 --> 03:17.875
And a gluten-free cupcake for Leo.

03:17.958 --> 03:20.541
He's still might barf,
but, uh, just use those blankets.

03:20.625 --> 03:23.208
Oh, and you have to wear this.

03:23.958 --> 03:24.833
Yeah, I'm good.

03:24.916 --> 03:26.583
Ooh! Can I be the dinosaur?

03:26.666 --> 03:27.875
Can I be the dinosaur?

03:27.958 --> 03:29.958
Hey, can I be the dinosaur?

03:30.041 --> 03:31.708
Uh, sure. Oh.

03:33.208 --> 03:36.375
'Kay, well, I guess you got everything.

03:36.458 --> 03:37.375
See you in ten hours.

03:37.458 --> 03:38.958
-Bye.
-Bye.

03:40.250 --> 03:41.208
Ah, there you are.

03:41.791 --> 03:44.458
Come on, Pugsley.
It's just a melon baller.

03:44.541 --> 03:45.458
Nice and quick.

03:45.541 --> 03:48.708
Go away,
I need my eyes to look at Barney.

03:51.333 --> 03:53.916
-Whoa, cool. Huh.

03:54.500 --> 03:56.083
"Happy birthday, Patrick."

03:56.166 --> 03:58.833
Hey, that kid looks a lot like…

03:58.916 --> 04:01.041
-Yeah!
-…he could be your brother.

04:04.166 --> 04:05.000
Barney?

04:05.083 --> 04:07.541
Uh. I need to go.

04:07.625 --> 04:09.458
And leave me with all these kids?

04:09.541 --> 04:10.583
No way, Jose.

04:10.666 --> 04:12.750
No, Norma, that was my little brother.

04:12.833 --> 04:14.166
He cannot see me.

04:14.250 --> 04:16.416
Oh, no, he can. He took the blindfold off.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.458
No, I mean, he <i>can't</i> see me.

04:19.000 --> 04:19.833
Oh.

04:20.375 --> 04:21.541
Then.

04:21.625 --> 04:23.125
Oh, yeah. Good idea.

04:24.333 --> 04:27.125
Ah, come on, Pugsley, it's just one eye.

04:27.208 --> 04:29.416
Who needs both eyes anyway?

04:29.500 --> 04:32.541
I mean they're not even making
3D movies anymore.

04:32.625 --> 04:35.875
-Phew.

04:35.958 --> 04:37.916
Patrick!

04:41.500 --> 04:43.250
Yeah!

04:43.333 --> 04:46.041
Barney, why won't you text back?

04:46.125 --> 04:47.666
Patrick, make a wish!

04:48.250 --> 04:49.416
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:50.250 --> 04:53.416
-Yay! Birthday, birthday! Whoo!

04:55.125 --> 04:59.041
<i>Hello? Any living children</i>
<i>around here? Hmm?</i>

04:59.666 --> 05:01.708
<i>Say good night to your sleep, boy,</i>

05:01.791 --> 05:07.500
<i>because I, the Night Hag,</i>
<i>am stealing it forever!</i>

05:07.583 --> 05:10.125
Oh, no! Please don't steal my sleep!

05:10.208 --> 05:12.583
Calm down, Leo. She isn't real.

05:12.666 --> 05:15.083
Yeah, it's just a lady
in makeup and a sheet.

05:15.166 --> 05:19.708
Um, actually it's a hand-painted
foam latex mask with a hog hair wig.

05:19.791 --> 05:21.083
Ew!

05:21.166 --> 05:23.750
Guys, enough talking,
her monologue is coming up.

05:23.833 --> 05:26.250
<i>And why am I like this?</i>

05:26.333 --> 05:28.875
<i>Oh, it's a story few would believe.</i>

05:28.958 --> 05:30.791
Well, I think the Night Hag is real.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.708
And once you've summoned her
and she's stolen your sleep,

05:34.791 --> 05:37.625
she'll turn you into the sleepless.

05:37.708 --> 05:38.791
-Oh!

05:38.875 --> 05:44.083
Frazzled, slap-happy, sleep-deprived
servants of the Night Hag.

05:44.166 --> 05:49.666
They creep around looking for more victims
so she can steal even more sleep.

05:50.250 --> 05:52.375
It's terrifying.

05:53.041 --> 05:54.833
Well, what are we waiting for?

05:54.916 --> 05:56.625
Let's summon that Hag.

05:59.125 --> 06:00.458
I should stop this.

06:00.541 --> 06:01.416
The summoning?

06:01.500 --> 06:02.458
No, the movie.

06:02.541 --> 06:04.166
I don't want to miss the monologue.

06:04.250 --> 06:06.375
Oh, yeah, it's the best part!

06:06.458 --> 06:09.541
You know, I was in a bidding war
for the original manuscripts,

06:09.625 --> 06:11.125
but someone outbid me.

06:11.708 --> 06:14.541
Wait, you're Playitcool-1-9-6-3?

06:15.250 --> 06:16.750
You are WigsforDays?

06:18.208 --> 06:20.541
How are you the Phoenix fandom admin?

06:20.625 --> 06:21.666
You're like five.

06:21.750 --> 06:24.250
Excuse you, I'm 11 next month.

06:24.333 --> 06:27.375
Pauline had already filmed seven
commercials by the time she was my age.

06:27.458 --> 06:30.083
Wow. You know your stuff.

06:30.166 --> 06:32.791
Finally an intelligent conversation.

06:32.875 --> 06:37.458
-seven, eight, nine, ten, 11.

06:38.583 --> 06:42.333
Quick, now, we just got
to turn the lights on and off 20 times.

06:42.416 --> 06:44.916
-Hey, you. Have you see you an alive dog?
-You're wrong…

06:45.000 --> 06:47.041
About yea-high, cartoony looking…

06:47.125 --> 06:49.291
-…smells like dumpster pizza?

06:49.375 --> 06:52.791
No! You chant "Night Hag" 13 times.

06:52.875 --> 06:54.208
Amateurs.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.916
-And what we have to do first is--
-Listen to me.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.583
Gargle water for seven seconds
and then sing,

07:01.666 --> 07:05.208
"Night Hag, fright hag, I summon thee"
into this wolf bone.

07:10.458 --> 07:13.583
What? This kid looks like
they know what they're talking about.

07:18.791 --> 07:20.583
Wow. I feel powerful.

07:20.666 --> 07:21.791
It's bedtime.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.041
Aww.

07:39.208 --> 07:40.958
Okay, here's what I need to know.

07:41.041 --> 07:42.625
What's your take on Barborah?

07:42.708 --> 07:45.333
Don't tell me you believe
those conspiracy theories.

07:45.416 --> 07:48.166
She claimed she was
the real Pauline for years.

07:48.250 --> 07:49.125
That's just a rumor.

07:49.208 --> 07:50.541
That's just the truth.

07:50.625 --> 07:52.291
"I am Pauline."

07:52.375 --> 07:55.833
"Phoenix's angry and quite athletic
stunt double dishes the truth."

07:55.916 --> 07:58.208
Put those lies away. It offends me.

07:59.208 --> 08:00.916
<i>The park has now closed.</i>

08:01.000 --> 08:02.250
<i>Thanks for visiting.</i>

08:02.333 --> 08:05.458
<i>Hope you all had a fantastic day.</i>

08:06.458 --> 08:09.666
<i>And please, take good care</i>
<i>of your children.</i>

08:10.208 --> 08:12.166
<i>Stay safe now.</i>

08:50.125 --> 08:54.750
Courtney, before you gouge the demon
out of me, can I ask you a question?

08:54.833 --> 08:55.666
Shoot.

08:55.750 --> 08:58.541
What do you do about homesickness?

08:59.375 --> 09:02.125
You can't go home and…
And… And neither can I.

09:02.208 --> 09:05.875
And I miss Patrick and my little patch
of dirt that used to be a flower bed,

09:05.958 --> 09:07.916
but I reclaimed as my sunbathing spot.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.250
I know Barney doesn't like it there
and I'm happy being with him,

09:11.333 --> 09:13.125
but I still feel--

09:13.208 --> 09:14.166
Restless?

09:14.250 --> 09:16.583
Like you're at a station
where the train's never coming,

09:16.666 --> 09:19.791
but you can't help thinking
that any second now it might show up?

09:19.875 --> 09:22.208
Yeah, exactly. What do you do about that?

09:22.291 --> 09:23.291
I don't know.

09:24.333 --> 09:26.916
You mind if I make a minor incision
in your cornea?

09:32.208 --> 09:33.708
Adella?

09:48.958 --> 09:51.458
-Oh, wow! It worked!

09:53.708 --> 09:56.666
Oh, no, it worked.

09:58.208 --> 10:00.500
Oh, hey, Patrick, buddy bro.

10:00.583 --> 10:07.458
Uh, so, yeah, I live here now
and I dress like a dinosaur? And…

10:20.750 --> 10:23.208
And now, there's a demon
at the sleepover party.

10:23.291 --> 10:24.250
Typical.

10:24.333 --> 10:25.583
Oh, no! Patrick!

10:27.875 --> 10:28.750
Patrick?

10:31.541 --> 10:34.083
Patrick, where are you? Patrick!

10:38.000 --> 10:39.916
It's exactly what it looks like.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.291
Hey, have you two seen--

11:01.833 --> 11:03.250
-Whoa!

11:12.125 --> 11:15.250
Of course, then there's <i>Night Hag 2:</i>
<i>The Revenge, Night Hag 3D…</i>

11:15.333 --> 11:18.083
<i>Night Hag Forever,</i>
<i>Night Hag: The Final Chapter…</i>

11:18.166 --> 11:20.208
<i>Night Hag: Origins, Night Hag: Origins 2.</i>

11:22.666 --> 11:23.666
Hey! What gives?

11:26.500 --> 11:27.333
Faster, Barney.

11:37.375 --> 11:38.708
What's wrong with them?

11:38.791 --> 11:41.000
They've had every night of sleep
they've ever had

11:41.083 --> 11:42.916
sucked right out of them by the Night Hag.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.541
These kids have been awake
for ten years straight

11:45.625 --> 11:47.250
and they're pretty cranky.

11:47.333 --> 11:48.791
Good luck!

11:48.875 --> 11:50.500
All right,
thanks for the help, Courtney.

11:59.541 --> 12:00.416
Patrick.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.916
Oh, I'm so glad you're safe.

12:04.916 --> 12:06.833
Barney, what are you doing here?

12:06.916 --> 12:08.125
Uh…

12:08.208 --> 12:09.250
Where have you been?

12:09.333 --> 12:11.916
Oh, yeah. Uh, I dress here now.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.125
I mean, I'm a dinosaur now?

12:14.208 --> 12:16.958
Nope. Wait, you still sleep with Mr. Max?

12:17.916 --> 12:20.208
Yeah, you gave him to me.

12:21.916 --> 12:23.250
Oh, no, my magazine!

12:24.666 --> 12:27.083
I live here,
but I don't always dress like--

12:27.166 --> 12:28.458
Pugsley!

12:28.541 --> 12:29.875
Happy birthday!

12:31.458 --> 12:33.000
Oh, yeah! I talk now.

12:33.083 --> 12:34.708
Oh, and I also have magic powers.

12:34.791 --> 12:36.375
Oh, yeah?

12:36.458 --> 12:38.708
I could do with those powers
right now, Pugsley.

12:40.458 --> 12:41.333
Help me!

12:41.875 --> 12:43.833
-Help!

12:43.916 --> 12:47.500
Norma, you've seen the movie.
How did the hero defeat these things?

12:47.583 --> 12:50.166
The Night Hag was actually
way ahead of its time.

12:50.250 --> 12:51.916
The hero dies in the second act.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.750
Actually, I think you'll find it's in
the beginning of the… third!

13:06.458 --> 13:07.375
Now!

13:39.250 --> 13:40.125
Norma?

13:54.375 --> 13:55.916
Why didn't you text back?

13:56.000 --> 13:57.625
I did?

13:58.375 --> 13:59.333
I mean, I didn't.

14:01.583 --> 14:03.375
I didn't know what to say.

14:03.958 --> 14:05.541
How about "Happy birthday"?

14:06.125 --> 14:08.166
I was gonna but… But then…

14:08.708 --> 14:10.625
Ugh! It's complicated.

14:11.375 --> 14:12.458
Happy birthday?

14:12.541 --> 14:13.500
You left me!

14:13.583 --> 14:15.583
No, no, never! I left

14:16.583 --> 14:17.416
everything.

14:18.500 --> 14:21.875
Mom and Dad say they accept me,
but then at dinner with Grammy Gram,

14:22.416 --> 14:24.541
they just let her say
all that awful stuff to me

14:24.625 --> 14:26.666
and acted like it wasn't even happening.

14:28.708 --> 14:30.041
I felt invisible.

14:32.625 --> 14:34.416
Mom will pick me up in the morning.

14:34.916 --> 14:36.625
Come home, Barney.

14:37.166 --> 14:38.000
Uh…

14:38.875 --> 14:39.750
I can't.

14:40.750 --> 14:42.208
-Huh?

14:45.000 --> 14:45.958
Patrick?

14:52.541 --> 14:53.375
Patrick.

15:05.708 --> 15:06.708
Barney?

15:15.166 --> 15:17.166
Barney, it's me! Your brother!

15:17.250 --> 15:18.791
-Barney, no!

15:39.000 --> 15:40.833
Patrick, over here!

15:59.583 --> 16:00.791
Swim, Patrick. Faster!

16:00.875 --> 16:01.958
Come on, swim!

16:02.041 --> 16:05.166
Pretend you're being chased by a dinosaur
because you are!

16:41.750 --> 16:43.000
Whoa!

16:54.958 --> 16:56.791
What? She's still here.

16:56.875 --> 16:59.625
Oh, you guys are terrible at this.

16:59.708 --> 17:00.625
Anyway, bye.

17:00.708 --> 17:02.291
No, wait! Help us.

17:02.375 --> 17:03.375
Okay.

17:03.458 --> 17:04.875
Quick, Pugsley, give me your eyes!

17:04.958 --> 17:06.666
What? No.

17:06.750 --> 17:07.833
Eh, worth a try.

17:09.916 --> 17:12.791
I'm fresh out of wolf bones,
so it looks like we're dead.

17:12.875 --> 17:14.208
Oh, wait.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.666
Why don't we use your magic?

17:17.750 --> 17:20.583
But I… I don't know how.
I haven't finished--

17:27.833 --> 17:29.000
Okay. What do I do?

17:29.083 --> 17:32.541
You're going to summon a Day Hag.

17:34.625 --> 17:35.541
A Day Hag?

17:35.625 --> 17:39.500
Yeah, <i>she's</i> every bit as day
as <i>she</i> is night.

17:39.583 --> 17:41.333
They'll cancel each other out.

17:41.416 --> 17:42.666
Now focus, Pugsley.

17:44.375 --> 17:46.416
Focus on what you want.

17:47.708 --> 17:50.375
Raise your paws and give it shape.

17:50.458 --> 17:51.833
What do you want, Pugsley?

17:51.916 --> 17:55.166
I don't know.
I just want this night to be over!

17:55.250 --> 17:56.833
And how?

17:56.916 --> 17:59.333
By, uh, saving everyone?

17:59.416 --> 18:00.500
Why?

18:00.583 --> 18:03.250
Because I want Patrick and Barney back.

18:03.333 --> 18:05.041
I want to stop all of this.

18:05.125 --> 18:06.291
So?

18:07.000 --> 18:09.041
So… So we can all go home!

18:09.125 --> 18:10.166
So do it!

18:12.375 --> 18:13.333
Day Hag.

18:16.458 --> 18:18.958
I summon thee!

18:29.083 --> 18:30.333
How do I know if it--

18:43.750 --> 18:45.166
Why, hello everyone.

18:45.250 --> 18:47.500
So sweet of you to summon me--

18:47.583 --> 18:48.416
Cheryl?

18:49.000 --> 18:49.958
Linda.

18:50.916 --> 18:54.625
Uh. You're looking well,
it's been a while.

18:54.708 --> 18:56.750
43,000 years.

18:56.833 --> 18:58.916
I'm sorry, okay?

18:59.000 --> 19:02.875
It's not easy being the only day walker
in a family of nocturnals.

19:02.958 --> 19:05.583
I can't stay up that late. I get bags.

19:06.583 --> 19:08.500
Look, I should have told you
I was leaving,

19:08.583 --> 19:10.416
but you have to understand,

19:10.500 --> 19:12.125
I wasn't happy in The Grotto.

19:12.666 --> 19:15.000
I needed to find my own people.

19:15.083 --> 19:19.083
I'm now the manager of a cosmetics counter
at the mall of Necropolis.

19:19.166 --> 19:21.041
I had no idea you felt that way.

19:21.583 --> 19:23.666
But I still missed my sister.

19:23.750 --> 19:25.416
And I've missed you.

19:25.958 --> 19:28.125
Night Hags can have sisters?

19:28.208 --> 19:29.791
Who are you calling "hags"?

19:30.416 --> 19:32.458
It's what you're called in all the books.

19:32.541 --> 19:34.041
That's so mean!

19:34.125 --> 19:36.000
Honestly, you spend a few millennia

19:36.083 --> 19:38.500
eating children's dreams
and living in a swamp

19:38.583 --> 19:40.500
and suddenly you're a hag.

19:40.583 --> 19:41.416
Come on, Cheryl.

19:41.500 --> 19:44.208
Let's catch up somewhere
a little less judgy.

19:56.958 --> 19:57.875
What?

19:58.541 --> 19:59.625
-Huh?
-Hey!

19:59.708 --> 20:01.916
-You should all be sleeping!

20:02.000 --> 20:03.541
Ugh

20:04.875 --> 20:07.625
Pugsley, that was amazing!

20:07.708 --> 20:09.125
He was very well instructed.

20:17.125 --> 20:20.041
Hey, nice to meet you in real life.
Sure you don't want this?

20:20.125 --> 20:22.708
You can keep it.
I'm not ready for "the truth."

20:22.791 --> 20:23.833
Your loss.

20:25.125 --> 20:27.458
Please, Barney. Just… Just…

20:27.541 --> 20:28.666
Oh, here they are.

20:28.750 --> 20:30.166
Patrick, my baby.

20:31.375 --> 20:36.375
Barney, I get why you left,
but please say hi to Mom and Dad,

20:37.000 --> 20:39.208
so they know you're okay.

20:39.291 --> 20:41.791
-Patrick.
-Hi, Mom.

20:42.666 --> 20:43.875
How were they?

20:43.958 --> 20:46.291
They didn't give you any trouble
getting to sleep, did they?

20:47.041 --> 20:48.083
Nuh-uh.

20:48.166 --> 20:49.166
Oh, good.

20:49.250 --> 20:51.041
We usually do small family parties,

20:51.125 --> 20:53.958
but it's too hard to keep
the peace at home right now.

20:54.041 --> 20:55.833
Mm. Mm.

20:55.916 --> 20:57.375
Did his brother show up?

20:58.041 --> 20:59.250
Uh…

20:59.833 --> 21:00.666
Oh.

21:00.750 --> 21:02.916
That's a shame. I thought he might.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.291
-Oh, maybe he--
-You know kids, though.

21:06.375 --> 21:09.208
He's done one of his little
disappearing acts.

21:11.083 --> 21:15.625
Maybe, uh,
he's, uh, just invisible.

21:18.875 --> 21:20.166
I know, right?

21:20.250 --> 21:24.916
Anywho, I'm glad Patrick got to have a day
off from everything and just have fun.

21:25.458 --> 21:26.583
Have a good day!

21:27.750 --> 21:29.958
Oh, hey!
Uh, kid, kid.

21:30.041 --> 21:32.208
Uh, don't… Don't forget your goody bag.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.916
It's got your birthday present.

21:39.416 --> 21:41.541
Thank you.

21:41.625 --> 21:43.125
Oh, sorry, sir.

21:43.666 --> 21:45.083
He's an affectionate kid.

22:00.416 --> 22:01.250
Mom?

22:01.791 --> 22:02.666
Mm-hmm?

22:02.750 --> 22:04.666
I have to tell you something.

22:07.041 --> 22:09.333
Well,
let's try this again. Shall we?

22:09.416 --> 22:10.875
Open.

22:13.375 --> 22:14.791
Finally!

22:14.875 --> 22:16.750
My train is at the platform!

22:16.833 --> 22:18.875
It's been fun, won't miss you. Bye!

22:21.208 --> 22:22.375
Ugh.

22:22.458 --> 22:23.416
Huh?

22:28.875 --> 22:30.291
No!

22:30.375 --> 22:32.541
That was it, Pugsley. I'm done!

22:33.083 --> 22:35.291
Oh, now I'm never going home.

22:35.375 --> 22:36.791
Oh, it's gonna be okay.

22:37.375 --> 22:39.000
We'll get through this together.

22:39.083 --> 22:40.083
<i>We</i> can be friends.

22:40.166 --> 22:42.125
I'm sick of here. I'm sick of friends.

22:42.708 --> 22:44.041
Leave me alone.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.333
My little good boy hat.

23:00.958 --> 23:02.750
Hey, Pugsley! I'm home.
