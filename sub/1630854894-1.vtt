WEBVTT

00:12.554 --> 00:13.555
I'm out.

00:14.306 --> 00:15.390
Raise.

00:15.390 --> 00:16.517
I call it.

00:21.438 --> 00:22.814
Here.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.150
Fuck.

00:25.150 --> 00:26.401
That's enough!

00:26.902 --> 00:28.153
Son of a bitch!

00:28.153 --> 00:29.488
...karma.

00:31.281 --> 00:34.243
Look at your face.
You're already out of it.

00:34.243 --> 00:35.994
I'm totally wasted.

00:37.287 --> 00:38.497
Cheers.

00:39.748 --> 00:42.918
Hey! It wasn't me! Hey!
-Yeah, I'll be back. I'll be back.

00:44.962 --> 00:46.505
Alex, come on!

00:46.505 --> 00:49.675
I can give you a good time!
Come here, please.

02:55.342 --> 02:56.677
Don't move.

03:18.490 --> 03:20.158
Samir, it's me.

03:20.868 --> 03:21.869
Open the door.

04:12.503 --> 04:14.254
Don't move!

04:39.863 --> 04:42.282
London Bridge is falling down

04:42.282 --> 04:44.409
Falling down, falling down
-What's going on?

04:44.409 --> 04:48.872
London Bridge is falling down
My fair lady

06:30.516 --> 06:33.227
It's the boss himself.
To what do I owe the honor?

06:33.227 --> 06:35.395
I have a job for you. It's urgent.

06:35.395 --> 06:36.605
Give me a second.

06:41.860 --> 06:42.986
I'm listening.

06:42.986 --> 06:45.822
Two Syrian hackers have contacted
the French Embassy for political asylum.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.158
We have to bring them back to Paris.
-Do they have passports?

06:48.158 --> 06:49.576
We're preparing them.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.371
And the DGSE?

06:52.371 --> 06:54.081
They're offside. It's just us.

06:55.666 --> 06:57.292
We proceed as usual?

06:57.292 --> 06:58.377
Yes.

06:59.169 --> 07:00.170
Okay.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.491
Good morning, Mr. President.
-Good morning.

07:30.742 --> 07:32.828
Madam Saint Roch.
-Mr. President.

07:33.620 --> 07:34.872
Hello, Didier.

07:36.081 --> 07:37.416
Could we have some coffee?

07:48.927 --> 07:50.012
Right.

07:51.013 --> 07:53.765
So why are you bothering me
at seven o'clock in the morning?

07:53.765 --> 07:56.143
We have a problem in Damascus,
Mr. President.

07:56.143 --> 07:59.313
In short, we have two Syrian hackers
in Damascus requesting political asylum.

07:59.313 --> 08:00.856
They have top secret information

08:00.856 --> 08:02.941
on impending terrorist cyberattacks
in Europe.

08:02.941 --> 08:05.777
Attacks? On civilian targets?

08:07.070 --> 08:09.489
At the moment, we don't have any details.

08:10.657 --> 08:13.744
But if they target our infrastructures,
there could be civilian casualties.

08:14.328 --> 08:17.748
And who are they? Are they known?

08:18.332 --> 08:20.417
They managed to destroy
the Syrian police data servers,

08:20.417 --> 08:22.419
which is Russian technology,
the best in the world.

08:22.419 --> 08:24.922
All we know is that they are geniuses,
and everyone wants them.

08:30.302 --> 08:32.596
And why did they choose France?

08:33.597 --> 08:35.349
Because of our policy against Assad?

08:37.017 --> 08:40.395
Also, perhaps because one of them
studied in Paris and speaks French.

08:40.395 --> 08:42.523
The younger one has never left Damascus.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.567
But it seems like--

08:45.567 --> 08:48.237
We have two options. Hand them over
to the Syrian intelligence services

08:48.237 --> 08:50.197
or extract them
and bring them back to France.

08:50.197 --> 08:53.283
Do the Syrian intelligence services know
that they've contacted the French Embassy?

08:53.283 --> 08:54.952
Not yet, but they'll find out soon.

08:54.952 --> 08:57.454
How long will the DGSE need
to extract them?

08:57.454 --> 08:58.622
Two days.

08:58.622 --> 09:01.667
With your approval,
I can have them extracted in an hour.

09:01.667 --> 09:05.379
We can't let the Russians get their hands
on them before we do, much less the Brits.

09:06.922 --> 09:09.550
Sorry, Sophie, but I was appointed
head of the task force,

09:09.550 --> 09:11.385
so I'm implementing new methods.

09:13.387 --> 09:14.721
I've already made a few calls.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.599
We have a reliable contact in Damascus
who can take care of it right away.

09:17.599 --> 09:19.226
I think we should go for it.

09:20.227 --> 09:23.105
Very well then. Okay, we'll do that.

09:23.605 --> 09:26.775
Madam Saint Roch, I'm relying on you
to make everything go smoothly.

10:15.324 --> 10:18.118
And you're sure it's a hack?
-That's what he said.

10:19.703 --> 10:21.496
Risk assessments in by Wednesday.

10:22.623 --> 10:23.624
Minister.

10:24.708 --> 10:26.960
We'll pick this up later.

10:29.004 --> 10:30.255
Talk to me, Mark.

10:31.173 --> 10:33.175
Well, it sounds worse than it is.

10:34.176 --> 10:36.929
There's been an intrusion
into our mainframe last night.

10:37.638 --> 10:39.097
Probably easiest if I show you.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.144
London Bridge is falling down

10:44.144 --> 10:46.355
Tower Bridge.
-Falling down, falling down...

10:46.355 --> 10:48.690
London Bridge is falling down
-Puss in Boots.

10:48.690 --> 10:50.984
My fair lady

10:52.528 --> 10:53.779
What the f--

10:53.779 --> 10:58.200
Someone found a temporary back door
into our DMZ, but we've closed it off now.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.409
And?

10:59.409 --> 11:01.245
It was a limited exploit. No payloads.

11:01.245 --> 11:04.581
We've triaged the server, and we're
confident no damage has been done.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.542
Who?

11:06.542 --> 11:10.963
We're analyzing the hex code
to identify the file signature,

11:10.963 --> 11:12.548
but that'll take a little time.

11:13.924 --> 11:16.718
So, the National Cyber Security Centre,

11:16.718 --> 11:20.305
responsible for the cyber security
of the nation,

11:21.598 --> 11:24.810
has been hacked by Puss in Boots.

11:24.810 --> 11:26.395
We really shouldn't panic.

11:26.395 --> 11:28.313
It's almost certainly
just a script kiddie.

11:29.273 --> 11:30.566
A what?

11:30.566 --> 11:32.860
Someone in their bedroom. A hobbyist.

11:32.860 --> 11:35.904
They source an existing exploit online,

11:35.904 --> 11:38.907
follow a video on YouTube or wherever,

11:38.907 --> 11:41.743
find an opening, light the fuse,
shove it through.

11:41.743 --> 11:43.829
There's a bang and some smoke, but--

11:43.829 --> 11:49.126
Could we just put a lid on the metaphors
and the excuses and just let me have it.

11:49.126 --> 11:50.752
Tell me how bad it really is.

11:50.752 --> 11:52.588
It really could have been worse.

11:53.589 --> 11:56.049
Okay. For now, we keep this contained.

11:57.092 --> 11:59.928
But Richard is right, Mark.
This is worrying.

11:59.928 --> 12:02.973
We've got to have
a thorough investigation, a full report.

12:02.973 --> 12:04.725
Yeah. Well, we're on it.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.327
I hate to say it...
-Then don't.

12:23.327 --> 12:26.997
...but Bolton may be right. There's
no evidence yet it's a major breach.

12:26.997 --> 12:29.583
We spend millions on cyber defenses.

12:29.583 --> 12:32.544
We can't be overrun
by the first toddler that climbs the wall.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.838
Well, you hired him.

12:34.838 --> 12:36.673
Well, you should have stopped me.

13:16.839 --> 13:17.840
Hello.

13:18.882 --> 13:20.676
How are you? Everything all right?

13:20.676 --> 13:22.052
Yes, yes. Everything's good.

13:23.095 --> 13:24.429
Are you being followed?

13:26.056 --> 13:27.057
No.

13:27.599 --> 13:28.600
So...

13:29.893 --> 13:31.436
on the road to Homs,

13:32.312 --> 13:35.858
at kilometer 100,
just before the Turkish border,

13:36.441 --> 13:38.777
Ain Aksa. You'll see a sign.

13:39.361 --> 13:41.738
Okay, thanks. And the passports?

13:43.031 --> 13:44.199
Under the seat.

13:49.621 --> 13:52.958
Thank you. Thank you so much.
How will we recognize you?

13:52.958 --> 13:56.628
Don't worry about that. But move your ass.
The chopper won't even wait two minutes.

14:02.009 --> 14:03.302
FRENCH REPUBLIC

14:14.062 --> 14:15.731
There are only two passports.

14:18.609 --> 14:19.943
Don't worry.

15:01.818 --> 15:02.986
Is that him?

15:04.321 --> 15:05.322
Yeah.

15:11.286 --> 15:13.247
Don't be scared, honey. Okay?
Don't be scared.

15:15.874 --> 15:17.209
Get out.

15:19.711 --> 15:21.213
Take your passport.

15:25.050 --> 15:26.552
Have you got everything?
-Yeah.

15:26.552 --> 15:27.970
Got your stuff?
-Yeah.

15:54.413 --> 15:55.497
Soldiers!

15:58.125 --> 15:59.126
Go! Go!

16:00.961 --> 16:03.589
Sons of bitches! They lied to us!
-Quickly! Get in! Get in!

16:03.589 --> 16:04.840
Drive!
-Samir!

16:05.924 --> 16:07.759
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

16:18.937 --> 16:21.398
Quickly. Quickly. Go. Go.

16:32.576 --> 16:33.994
Don't move!

16:39.249 --> 16:40.250
Are you okay?

16:56.308 --> 16:57.559
What a success.

16:58.894 --> 17:02.189
I have satellite images
of your major screwup. Want to see?

17:04.023 --> 17:05.358
Sure.

17:06.527 --> 17:08.694
This was just sent by our spy satellite.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.656
We have the area
under constant surveillance.

17:14.409 --> 17:16.244
I assume that guy is your agent.

17:17.496 --> 17:19.665
I don't know. I don't handle the details.

17:21.666 --> 17:23.961
There are no "details"
in this line of work, Didier.

17:23.961 --> 17:27.714
Thanks to you,
all these people have disappeared.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.758
They're off the radar.

17:31.385 --> 17:32.553
Thank you, Sophie.

17:34.555 --> 17:37.057
Don't get too excited. I'm not dead yet.

17:54.825 --> 17:57.327
Go on. Get lost. We're keeping him.

18:00.205 --> 18:02.291
French, right? The DGSE.

18:04.001 --> 18:06.962
Where are they? Where are the hackers?

18:13.135 --> 18:16.180
Did you have safe house planned? Anything?

18:18.515 --> 18:21.602
Hey! Hey! Hey!

18:26.356 --> 18:27.357
Hey!

18:27.983 --> 18:29.610
Gabriel? Gabriel!

18:29.610 --> 18:31.069
Mitzia! Mitzia!
-Wait, wait, wait!

18:32.905 --> 18:34.615
Is this your buddy?
-Yes.

18:34.615 --> 18:36.533
We were on a mission together in Liberia.

18:36.533 --> 18:38.827
He's not with DGSE.
He's a private contractor.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.919
Monrovia. The airport.

18:46.919 --> 18:48.545
We made a fucking mess there.

18:48.545 --> 18:50.130
This dude is crazy.

18:50.130 --> 18:52.508
Oh, brother.

18:56.094 --> 18:57.763
You still work for Dumas's company?

18:58.514 --> 19:01.225
Yeah, Telkis. Why?

19:03.143 --> 19:04.311
You looking for a job?

19:06.563 --> 19:09.483
Seriously. How much are you making
on this operation?

19:10.651 --> 19:12.152
Nowhere near enough.

19:14.363 --> 19:18.909
The guys we're working for
would pay a lot more.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.123
Come on. How much do you want?

19:30.254 --> 19:32.506
I want a different life.

19:35.092 --> 19:36.260
I'm tired.

19:56.530 --> 19:57.656
Yes, Richard.

19:57.656 --> 20:00.033
I sent you a draft of the speech.
Did you read it?

20:00.033 --> 20:01.118
I did.

20:01.118 --> 20:03.912
Needs some jokes. Work some magic, okay?

20:03.912 --> 20:05.539
I will.
-Bye.

20:06.790 --> 20:07.791
Right.

20:09.918 --> 20:11.295
Oh, shit.

20:15.090 --> 20:17.509
Oh, shit, shit. Shit.

20:21.930 --> 20:23.390
Hey.

20:23.390 --> 20:26.226
Call the Raj.
Tell them to send over dinner.

20:26.226 --> 20:27.311
What happened?

20:28.520 --> 20:29.730
Richard called.

20:30.355 --> 20:33.317
What, and told you
to set fire to the house?

20:45.204 --> 20:46.371
Richard.

20:46.371 --> 20:48.457
Alison there?
-No, no, no. She's--

20:48.457 --> 20:50.250
She's just jumped into the shower.
-Urgent?

20:50.250 --> 20:52.836
Is it urgent?
-If I'm calling, it's always urgent.

20:52.836 --> 20:55.380
Tell her I'll leave the office
in five minutes.

20:55.881 --> 20:58.842
Okay, I'll have her call you
as soon as she's free.

20:58.842 --> 21:02.137
Thank you.
-Okay. Bye.

21:05.766 --> 21:06.975
What is all this about?

21:07.643 --> 21:10.771
Well, we're both here at the same time.

21:10.771 --> 21:12.731
I thought that's something to celebrate.

21:13.857 --> 21:16.401
And we've got the place
to ourselves tonight.

21:16.985 --> 21:19.404
You know, actually,
I have something to celebrate.

21:19.404 --> 21:20.489
What?

21:21.198 --> 21:22.533
You have to guess.

21:22.533 --> 21:23.700
A puppy.

21:24.576 --> 21:25.953
We won the case.

21:28.497 --> 21:30.457
You're amazing!
-I know.

21:31.250 --> 21:32.876
Albert, that's so fucking incredible!

21:32.876 --> 21:36.421
Oh, yes!

21:40.384 --> 21:41.426
Come here.

21:42.761 --> 21:43.762
Come on.

22:28.098 --> 22:29.558
Where's the passport?

22:34.396 --> 22:37.482
Chill. We're going to make it.

22:38.525 --> 22:40.360
Three hours from now we'll be in Turkey.

23:08.430 --> 23:09.765
Passports.

23:42.047 --> 23:45.259
Can't you shut him up?
-I don't know. Maybe he's sick.

23:55.686 --> 23:56.812
Move it.

24:47.321 --> 24:49.698
High water in 90.

24:50.616 --> 24:52.576
Okay. Raise B and C barriers.

24:52.576 --> 24:54.912
Raising B and C.

25:15.557 --> 25:16.934
You picked up.

25:17.935 --> 25:20.979
Hey, Richard. This must be urgent.

25:22.314 --> 25:26.902
I'm in a room full of amoebas
masquerading as British politicians.

25:27.528 --> 25:29.613
And you decided not to get drunk.

25:30.364 --> 25:31.740
Know what I've come to realize?

25:31.740 --> 25:33.033
Thank you.

25:33.033 --> 25:35.285
That there is a limit

25:35.285 --> 25:39.289
as to just how many morons
you can put up with in a day.

25:41.917 --> 25:43.252
So why did you call?

25:43.794 --> 25:47.089
I'm still thinking about our friend,
Puss in Boots,

25:47.089 --> 25:49.466
and I don't trust Bolton's explanation.

25:50.175 --> 25:53.470
We have to get a grip of this, Alison.
You and me.

25:54.096 --> 25:56.390
And I have to tell the PM
what's happening.

25:57.057 --> 25:58.642
No, no. Don't tell him tonight.

25:59.226 --> 26:00.227
Why?

26:00.227 --> 26:02.104
Give Bolton a few more hours.

26:02.104 --> 26:04.815
You know the digital forensic stuff
takes time.

26:04.815 --> 26:07.401
You can give the PM an update
when we have clarity.

26:09.111 --> 26:11.905
As always, you would be right.

26:14.074 --> 26:15.868
Good luck getting home tonight.

26:16.827 --> 26:19.288
Good luck and good night.

26:39.183 --> 26:40.184
What the fuck?

26:40.934 --> 26:42.644
D not responding.

26:46.315 --> 26:47.149
Come on.

26:51.862 --> 26:53.113
Close it.
-What's happening?

27:08.504 --> 27:11.173
London has suffered extensive flooding

27:11.173 --> 27:16.094
after the tidal storm surge combined with
heavy rain overwhelmed flood defenses.

27:17.346 --> 27:19.890
The Thames barrier
was breached for the first time

27:19.890 --> 27:21.391
since it went into service in 1982...

27:21.391 --> 27:24.770
I've spoken to the duty officer,
and they can't raise the barrier.

27:26.063 --> 27:27.523
So what are you saying?

27:28.065 --> 27:31.276
Apparently, the computer won't allow it.

27:32.277 --> 27:33.779
It's a proper hack this time.

27:35.405 --> 27:36.573
The full English.

27:37.616 --> 27:43.205
So, Bolton's on his way down there now,
and I need you to chaperone him.

27:44.248 --> 27:46.208
Find out what the hell's really going on.

27:46.708 --> 27:47.918
Okay, Richard.

27:49.086 --> 27:51.463
With a significant
proportion of groups in...

27:51.964 --> 27:55.133
A TFL spokesperson said
that it is too early to say

27:55.133 --> 27:56.718
when services will resume.

27:57.427 --> 28:02.474
City airport in East London has also been
forced to ground all flights indefinitely.

28:03.058 --> 28:07.521
It's not yet known if there's been any
loss of life as a result of the flooding.

28:08.564 --> 28:11.525
The prime minister will share more
over an emergency council meeting...

28:47.102 --> 28:50.397
When a high North Sea tidal surge
combines with heavy rains--

28:50.397 --> 28:51.565
You raise the barriers.
-Yes.

28:51.565 --> 28:54.276
I get all that. What I don't understand
is why you called us.

28:54.276 --> 28:57.279
The way the barrier's jammed up,
the timings of it,

28:57.279 --> 28:59.239
it's all too precise.

28:59.239 --> 29:00.574
We were hacked.

29:00.574 --> 29:01.658
Based on what?

29:01.658 --> 29:04.578
Someone was inside the system.

29:04.578 --> 29:07.372
A gate would fail. We'd reset it.
It'd fail again.

29:07.372 --> 29:09.416
We'd reset it again, all the way up.

29:09.416 --> 29:12.252
Then the next one would lower,
we'd have to start over.

29:12.252 --> 29:15.047
In the 10 years I've worked here,
I've never seen anything like it.

29:15.047 --> 29:17.174
I'm telling you, it was intentional.

29:17.174 --> 29:20.385
I checked up on the system
before we came over.

29:20.385 --> 29:23.180
It hasn't been updated since--
-Since 2002.

29:24.431 --> 29:27.851
There you go. The older the system,
the more likely an error.

29:27.851 --> 29:30.187
Or the easier it is to get hacked.

29:32.606 --> 29:34.733
It's not like this is out of the blue.

29:34.733 --> 29:37.444
You had a giant cat
all over your screens yesterday.

29:38.278 --> 29:40.781
All right, fine. We'll look into it.

29:43.992 --> 29:46.620
You know as well as I do
Banks isn't gonna like this.

29:46.620 --> 29:49.289
Wasting our time investigating
a malfunctioning gate.

29:49.957 --> 29:52.793
I think what Banks will like
is you sorting all this out.

29:55.128 --> 29:56.129
All right.

30:28.620 --> 30:31.456
You want some breakfast?
Westminster's finest.

30:33.333 --> 30:34.459
Just coffee.

30:40.632 --> 30:42.467
Glad to see you survived last night.

30:45.053 --> 30:46.054
So?

30:49.266 --> 30:51.643
The operators think
someone got into the system.

30:56.315 --> 30:57.858
What does Bolton say?

30:58.817 --> 31:00.777
He's convinced it's a software failure.

31:03.405 --> 31:07.409
If this is a second hack in 24 hours...

31:07.409 --> 31:10.537
Even then, we don't know
they're connected. They're different.

31:10.537 --> 31:13.123
The first one w--
-The first one was the starter.

31:15.209 --> 31:19.338
If this is a second hack,
then it's the main meal.

31:19.338 --> 31:21.757
They've proven to us they can do it,

31:21.757 --> 31:24.760
that they can bring this entire city
to its knees.

31:24.760 --> 31:27.554
In fact, the entire country.

31:28.096 --> 31:30.766
And there's nothing we can do
to stop them.

31:38.857 --> 31:39.900
All right.

31:41.109 --> 31:42.486
We tell the PM.

31:53.580 --> 31:55.874
This is a security announcement.

31:55.874 --> 31:58.877
Please do not leave
any bags or luggages unattended.

31:59.378 --> 32:02.130
Any unattended items
will be treated as suspicious

32:02.130 --> 32:04.550
and will be taken
by the airport authorities.

32:04.550 --> 32:07.052
Keep your bag with you at all times.

32:13.058 --> 32:14.560
Where is he? Can you see him?

32:15.185 --> 32:16.436
Yeah. There he is.

32:21.483 --> 32:23.569
Walid! Samir!
-Hi! How are you?

32:25.612 --> 32:28.198
My son, how are you?
-Hi, Uncle.

32:31.618 --> 32:33.245
Myriam? Hicham? Aren't they with you?

32:33.245 --> 32:34.580
They stayed at Turkey.

32:34.580 --> 32:36.957
Hicham had to go to hospital.
Myriam stayed with him.

32:37.791 --> 32:40.919
Is it bad?
-No. Nothing serious. Just dehydration.

32:40.919 --> 32:44.756
And no visa either.
But they're both safe. No need to worry.

32:44.756 --> 32:46.508
That's a relief.

32:52.306 --> 32:53.724
What happened to your face, Walid?

32:53.724 --> 32:56.393
Nothing. I had a bike accident.

33:00.397 --> 33:02.316
Did you prepare Mulukhiyah?
-Of course.

33:02.316 --> 33:04.359
Did you come here by car or by taxi?
-My car is outside.

33:04.359 --> 33:05.277
Let's go.

33:06.570 --> 33:07.863
Give the bags to me.

33:12.284 --> 33:13.994
This one too, Uncle.

33:13.994 --> 33:15.078
Give.

33:16.455 --> 33:19.124
Look, Samir. I found him.

33:20.542 --> 33:22.336
Is that him?
-Yeah.

33:22.336 --> 33:23.587
I'll text him.

33:56.828 --> 33:59.289
What a handsome fella!

33:59.790 --> 34:02.000
You're a cute one. Aren't you a cute one?

34:03.627 --> 34:04.628
How's it going?
-How are you?

34:04.628 --> 34:05.629
I'm good, and you?

34:09.967 --> 34:11.426
What? What?

34:11.426 --> 34:12.719
Gabriel!

34:13.512 --> 34:15.054
You're in Paris!

34:16.556 --> 34:18.141
What the hell is this? You've lost weight!

34:18.141 --> 34:20.726
What about it?
-Yeah. Syria doesn't agree with you.

34:20.726 --> 34:22.228
It doesn't agree with anyone.

34:22.228 --> 34:24.773
Anyway, I'm hungry. What'll you have?
-Whatever you want.

34:24.773 --> 34:26.775
Anything is fine,
as long as it's French, please.

34:26.775 --> 34:28.235
French? Okay.

34:28.235 --> 34:30.237
Adele, give some food to my friend.

34:30.237 --> 34:31.321
Sure.

34:37.661 --> 34:39.204
I'm coming down.
-Please.

34:43.625 --> 34:44.960
You actually did lose weight.

34:45.793 --> 34:46.879
You lost weight.

34:47.504 --> 34:48.505
You know where I was?

34:48.505 --> 34:51.592
Can we talk about how someone ratted us
out to the Syrian intelligence services?

34:52.217 --> 34:54.261
So, any idea who?

34:56.054 --> 34:57.054
I have no idea.

34:57.054 --> 34:59.183
I thought it was the DGSE, those bastards,

35:00.642 --> 35:02.269
but it wasn't.

35:02.269 --> 35:04.062
Well, it didn't come from me.

35:04.062 --> 35:06.940
Nobody in my company knew
about this operation.

35:07.983 --> 35:09.818
Well, those Russians knew about it.

35:10.777 --> 35:12.321
What were they doing there though?

35:12.905 --> 35:15.490
You're asking me? How would I know?

35:16.325 --> 35:17.743
From what I understood,

35:17.743 --> 35:21.455
they were putting pressure on the Syrians
to hand over the hackers. That's it.

35:22.164 --> 35:23.790
Look, my client is breathing down my neck.

35:23.790 --> 35:26.168
We have to bring them
back to Paris quickly.

35:26.168 --> 35:29.213
We tapped the phone
of one of their mothers in Syria.

35:29.213 --> 35:32.424
She called her son,
and we got their location.

35:33.258 --> 35:34.927
They're in London.

35:34.927 --> 35:36.053
In London?

35:37.471 --> 35:40.057
They have an uncle that works in a hotel.

35:40.057 --> 35:42.893
And according to the conversation,
they're afraid of getting killed.

35:44.394 --> 35:45.896
Honestly, they should be.

35:45.896 --> 35:49.149
If they get killed,
we'll look like real idiots.

35:51.360 --> 35:52.903
Who's your client?

35:52.903 --> 35:54.696
You know I can't tell you.

35:55.572 --> 35:58.909
However, what you should be looking for
is a USB key.

35:58.909 --> 36:00.744
He should still be carrying it with him.

36:04.164 --> 36:06.041
Here. Your papers and passport.

36:09.002 --> 36:12.047
Jean Petit?
We always have weird names, I swear...

36:13.090 --> 36:14.466
You're a European diplomat.

36:14.466 --> 36:17.302
Here's an encrypted phone.
You can call me whenever you want.

36:18.136 --> 36:20.305
I trust you. Play nice, all right?

36:54.464 --> 36:56.216
You've reached Mark Bolton's phone.

36:56.216 --> 36:58.552
I can't take your call at the moment,
but please leave a--

37:05.559 --> 37:07.436
Hurry up.
They're asking for you in the kitchen.

37:07.436 --> 37:08.520
Okay.
-Any luck?

37:08.520 --> 37:10.355
No, still no answer.

39:39.838 --> 39:40.839
Walid!

39:46.136 --> 39:47.137
Walid!

39:59.650 --> 40:01.026
Calm down!

40:01.026 --> 40:03.028
We need to talk.

41:34.536 --> 41:36.663
BIOMETRIC CODE ACCEPTED
ENTER THE PASSCODE

41:50.552 --> 41:51.678
Are you okay?

41:51.678 --> 41:54.348
"Okay?" Look.

41:54.348 --> 41:55.682
Real smooth.

41:55.682 --> 41:57.017
But look.

41:59.061 --> 42:00.646
I managed to steal this.

42:00.646 --> 42:02.523
Were you able to open it?

42:02.523 --> 42:04.107
Yes, but we need a password.

42:05.108 --> 42:06.485
You need to find Samir.

42:07.152 --> 42:08.570
You can count on me.

42:22.709 --> 42:26.213
Yes, Mr. Taraud. I have great news.
We found the Syrians.

42:26.213 --> 42:27.339
Really? Where are they?

42:27.339 --> 42:29.216
In London.
-Are you kidding me?

42:30.050 --> 42:32.886
I pay you to bring them back to Paris,
and you tell me they're in London?

42:32.886 --> 42:34.972
Wait. The important thing
is that we've located them.

42:34.972 --> 42:36.515
I'll take care of the rest, all right?

42:37.641 --> 42:41.895
Dumas, if those guys sell their intel
to the Brits, it'll be a disaster.

42:41.895 --> 42:46.108
I know, I know. But trust me. All right?

43:13.302 --> 43:14.636
Uncle.
-Samir.

43:14.636 --> 43:17.931
What happened? Where is he?
-I don't know.

43:17.931 --> 43:20.434
Samir, the cops are interrogating
all the staff.

43:20.434 --> 43:22.019
You have to leave, right away.

43:23.812 --> 43:26.440
What about Walid? I can't abandon him.

43:27.649 --> 43:30.110
I'm here.
I'll find him and take care of him.

43:30.694 --> 43:32.487
Yes, take care of him. Okay.

43:32.487 --> 43:33.989
Take care of him, Uncle.

43:33.989 --> 43:35.741
Samir, what did you do?

43:37.201 --> 43:42.956
Nothing. We hacked Assad's police files,
but we found something more dangerous.

43:43.498 --> 43:45.334
We have nothing to do with the rest.

43:46.210 --> 43:48.337
"The rest"? What do you mean?

43:51.173 --> 43:53.717
If people say we're terrorists,
don't believe them.

43:54.426 --> 43:56.637
I swear to God, we don't mean any harm.

43:57.262 --> 43:58.263
I know.

44:04.228 --> 44:06.021
Here, take this.

44:06.021 --> 44:08.524
No, Uncle. You keep it. Keep it.

44:09.358 --> 44:11.985
Be patient with me.
We're going to have a lot of money.

44:11.985 --> 44:13.070
But how?

44:13.820 --> 44:15.030
It won't be long, Uncle.

44:16.406 --> 44:18.158
What I know is real gold.

44:24.665 --> 44:25.666
Let's go.

45:09.585 --> 45:10.919
Cheers, mate.

45:13.839 --> 45:15.841
No, mate. I'm full up. I'm full up!

45:15.841 --> 45:17.009
Oh, come on then.

45:18.886 --> 45:20.554
Thanks.
-Cheers, mate.

45:21.388 --> 45:23.765
Can you move right down
the side of the bus, please?

45:23.765 --> 45:25.058
Do you mind?

46:05.390 --> 46:07.935
Oi, hang on. What you doing?
Front door doesn't open, mate.

46:09.102 --> 46:12.105
What you doing?
No, the front door doesn't open.

46:12.105 --> 46:13.190
Oi!
-Hey!

46:46.348 --> 46:48.725
Bravo, Didier.
It's getting better and better.

46:49.226 --> 46:50.894
The Brits are searching
for a European diplomat

46:50.894 --> 46:53.146
who beat up a Syrian hacker in London.

46:53.146 --> 46:55.232
Wouldn't that be your agent by any chance?

46:55.941 --> 46:57.693
We told the British he wasn't one of ours.

46:57.693 --> 47:00.028
I'm warning you, if he gets arrested,
he's on his own.

47:00.028 --> 47:03.615
The DGSE will not lift a finger.
-That won't be necessary.

47:14.710 --> 47:16.336
There you are.
-Alison.

47:16.336 --> 47:18.172
Where are you with the report?

47:18.172 --> 47:21.884
There's about to be a briefing.
CTC. They've got a suspect.

47:22.926 --> 47:25.220
Puss in Boots?
-And the barrier.

47:27.431 --> 47:29.766
There's no evidence yet
the barrier was a hack.

47:30.392 --> 47:31.935
So, it's a coincidence?

47:33.270 --> 47:36.106
Two highly suspicious incidents
in 24 hours.

47:37.566 --> 47:39.109
There was nothing in the initial triage.

47:39.109 --> 47:42.821
We've imaged the system, and we're combing
through the fragments in the Slacks base.

47:42.821 --> 47:45.657
But, as I keep saying,
these things take time.

47:47.367 --> 47:48.702
Come on, Mark.

47:48.702 --> 47:49.995
"Come on, Mark" what?

47:49.995 --> 47:52.456
You keep saying to me,
"You must find this weird."

47:52.456 --> 47:55.083
I deal with data, Alison.
Concrete evidence.

47:55.083 --> 47:58.003
So, when will you know? Definitively?

47:58.670 --> 48:00.589
Could be days. It could be weeks.

48:00.589 --> 48:03.592
The Thames barrier has a very big server,
funnily enough.

48:05.385 --> 48:06.762
I'll see you upstairs.

48:24.363 --> 48:26.532
Right. Thank you, everybody.

48:27.282 --> 48:30.160
Today's presentation
will be led by DI Hobbs

48:30.160 --> 48:33.580
who is leading the investigation
of last night's incident.

48:33.580 --> 48:36.041
Suspected terrorist and hacker,
Walid Hamza,

48:36.041 --> 48:38.710
was taken to hospital at 10:30 p.m.

48:38.710 --> 48:41.755
He's still unconscious, although
we've been told his condition is stable.

48:41.755 --> 48:44.091
Born in Damascus, '94.

48:44.091 --> 48:48.095
Enrolled 2014 in the Paris 6
Marie Curie University.

48:48.095 --> 48:50.889
Computer sciences. Something of a prodigy.

48:51.807 --> 48:55.310
Graduated with honors 2017,
then returned to Syria.

48:55.310 --> 48:57.688
At the height of the conflict.
-That's right.

48:57.688 --> 49:00.816
He successfully hacked
Assad's security services.

49:00.816 --> 49:04.945
We don't know why or who he's working for,
but he's clearly got form.

49:04.945 --> 49:07.406
However, no record
of any return to Europe.

49:07.406 --> 49:10.742
He seems to have entered the UK illegally,
although we don't know when.

49:11.869 --> 49:13.620
Okay, Hamza's attacker...

49:15.831 --> 49:18.625
Facial recognition identifies him
as Jean Petit,

49:19.376 --> 49:23.547
a French national part of a visiting
EU delegation here in London.

49:24.256 --> 49:25.883
MI5 confirm this?

49:25.883 --> 49:28.427
For the moment,
everything about him checks out,

49:28.427 --> 49:31.847
which doesn't square
with this man's profile.

49:31.847 --> 49:34.016
He's clearly some kind of pro.

49:34.016 --> 49:36.351
So what do you think? French intelligence?

49:36.351 --> 49:37.978
We don't know yet.

49:37.978 --> 49:39.688
Why haven't we arrested him yet?

49:39.688 --> 49:40.939
Diplomatic immunity.

49:40.939 --> 49:42.733
Also, we don't know where he is.

49:44.484 --> 49:46.320
Do we ask the French for help?
-No.

49:46.820 --> 49:49.114
No, I don't wanna open that can of worms.

49:50.073 --> 49:52.492
No, we have to find a way
to revoke his immunity.

49:52.993 --> 49:55.287
No, we can't do that.

49:56.288 --> 49:59.124
We'd have the media and every human rights
group jumping down our throats.

49:59.124 --> 50:00.709
Not if we do it the right way.

50:00.709 --> 50:04.046
Not if we find someone
who's beyond reproach,

50:04.046 --> 50:06.423
someone like your better half, Albert.

50:10.427 --> 50:13.555
I'm not sure involving Albert wouldn't
create a conflict of interest for me.

50:13.555 --> 50:17.184
Conflict? Either you wanna
get this guy or you don't.

50:18.268 --> 50:21.563
Richard, if we're going to do this,
it will need to be classified.

50:21.563 --> 50:24.816
If the media gets so much as a whisper--
-All right. All right. On it.

50:24.816 --> 50:30.864
Let's just concentrate on finding a way
to revoke this bastard's immunity

50:30.864 --> 50:33.158
and figure out what the fuck's going on.

50:44.586 --> 50:46.255
Can I have a word?

50:46.255 --> 50:48.590
I've decided to make way.

50:49.675 --> 50:51.844
I'm officially handing in my notice.

50:53.303 --> 50:54.638
Well, that's a bugger.

50:55.639 --> 50:57.766
Because as much as it pains me
to say this,

50:57.766 --> 51:00.477
I kind of need you
to stay in your post just now.

51:00.477 --> 51:02.354
Yeah. No offense, Richard, but fuck off.

51:03.981 --> 51:06.316
I know when I'm being set up
to be a fall guy.

51:07.025 --> 51:09.236
I've been abused and humiliated enough.

51:09.236 --> 51:12.531
Go through that door and this last week
will feel like a health spa.

51:14.491 --> 51:18.036
I will unleash the fucking hounds on you.

51:28.505 --> 51:32.176
Consider it an opportunity
to redeem yourself.

52:22.267 --> 52:23.852
What would your mother say?

52:27.314 --> 52:28.857
Courtesy of the Raj.

52:29.525 --> 52:31.109
Nice.
-You okay?

52:32.945 --> 52:33.946
Hey!

52:36.156 --> 52:37.491
Kim!

52:37.491 --> 52:38.700
This girl.

52:39.660 --> 52:40.827
We had a chat.

52:40.827 --> 52:44.665
Neighbor said she saw her smoking weed
with some roughnecks on the corner.

52:45.999 --> 52:47.459
That'll make Linda happy.

52:49.211 --> 52:51.296
I don't exactly plan on telling her.

52:53.757 --> 52:57.553
Oh, darling.
Got an interesting call today.

52:58.053 --> 53:01.598
Mr. Banks offered me a pretty big case.

53:04.184 --> 53:06.270
You mean Jean Petit?
-Yeah.

53:12.693 --> 53:13.694
Albert.

53:14.945 --> 53:16.321
I hate to say this...

53:18.323 --> 53:21.118
but he didn't offer it to you
because of how skilled you are.

53:21.118 --> 53:22.411
What do you mean?

53:22.911 --> 53:26.999
He offered it to you because you're
a prominent Black human rights lawyer

53:26.999 --> 53:30.043
and far less likely to be suspected
of breaking the law.

53:33.463 --> 53:35.215
I won't be breaking the law.

53:36.341 --> 53:38.886
You think you can get his immunity lifted
another way?

53:38.886 --> 53:40.679
If anyone can...

53:45.976 --> 53:47.895
Do you know how big this could be for me?

53:49.938 --> 53:51.273
I know.

53:51.273 --> 53:52.816
So, then what's the problem?

53:54.318 --> 53:57.529
You're worried I might get too close
to your boss?

53:58.822 --> 54:01.408
That'll never happen.
-Why not, eh?

54:01.408 --> 54:03.869
Because that's not
how it works with Richard.

54:03.869 --> 54:05.996
He'll get what he needs and drop you.

54:14.588 --> 54:15.589
Albert.
