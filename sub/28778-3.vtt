00:01.802 --> 00:02.735
<i>My name is Danny McNamara.</i>

00:02.803 --> 00:04.236
<i>When I left the FBI, I thought</i>

00:04.305 --> 00:06.438
<i>my crime-fighting days were
over, but then I learned</i>

00:06.507 --> 00:08.485
<i>that terrorist Karim Farouk
was on the hunt for Cleopatra,</i>

00:08.509 --> 00:10.609
<i>one of the world's
most valuable treasures,</i>

00:10.678 --> 00:12.478
<i>lost for over 2,000 years,</i>

00:12.546 --> 00:14.847
<i>to use her as part
of a massive terror attack.</i>

00:14.915 --> 00:16.315
<i>To find him, I needed some help,</i>

00:16.384 --> 00:18.884
<i>so I went to Lexi Vaziri,
a thief.</i>

00:18.953 --> 00:21.620
<i>Excuse me, a master thief.</i>

00:21.689 --> 00:23.722
<i>And my father
was killed by Farouk.</i>

00:23.791 --> 00:26.358
<i>Lexi and I have
a complicated past.</i>

00:26.427 --> 00:29.695
<i>He wants to bring Farouk
to justice, I want revenge.</i>

00:29.764 --> 00:31.897
<i>Also, there's a mysterious group</i>

00:31.966 --> 00:33.565
<i>who want Cleopatra
as much as we do.</i>

00:33.634 --> 00:36.301
<i>We're not sure
whether they're good or bad,</i>

00:36.370 --> 00:37.848
<i>but the one thing
we all agree on...</i>

00:37.872 --> 00:39.705
<i>Is that we need
to find Cleopatra...</i>

00:41.275 --> 00:43.342
<i>Before Farouk does.</i>

00:44.545 --> 00:46.879
<i>Previously on</i>
Blood & Treasure...

00:46.947 --> 00:48.847
<i>My old friend Father Chuck</i>

00:48.916 --> 00:50.394
works at the Vatican's
Foreign Ministry.

00:50.418 --> 00:51.550
Oh, my God, you're Lexi.

00:51.619 --> 00:53.185
<i>It looks like
you're getting mixed up</i>

00:53.254 --> 00:55.988
with a criminal who's already
broken your heart once.

00:56.057 --> 00:58.057
Omar, I need you
to find the girl,

00:58.159 --> 01:02.027
the American, and Aiden Shaw,
then kill them all.

01:02.096 --> 01:04.263
<i>Aiden Shaw was Farouk's fence.</i>

01:04.331 --> 01:05.809
<i>He is our only thread
to finding him.</i>

01:05.833 --> 01:08.167
Agent Karlsson. Captain Fabi.

01:08.235 --> 01:11.270
Why is the Carabinieri
following Danny McNamara?

01:11.338 --> 01:14.740
<i>The Nazis took Cleopatra
in the 1940s.</i>

01:14.809 --> 01:16.208
<i>I am just trying</i>

01:16.277 --> 01:18.110
to figure out why.
What if they were trying

01:18.179 --> 01:20.746
to turn an artifact into
a weapon of mass destruction?

01:20.815 --> 01:22.948
<i>Maybe that's what
Farouk wants to do.</i>

01:23.017 --> 01:25.751
Fabi, if anyone gets in our way,

01:25.820 --> 01:27.219
it will be up to you

01:27.288 --> 01:29.721
to deal with them all.

01:37.631 --> 01:40.799
Welcome to <i> La casa di Chuck.</i>

01:40.868 --> 01:43.469
I promise it's only temporary.

01:43.537 --> 01:45.437
Yeah, yeah, I know, sure.

01:45.506 --> 01:47.106
It's all right.
I don't mind if you

01:47.174 --> 01:49.675
squat here, but, um...
Ooh, yes, nice sword.

01:49.743 --> 01:50.676
You know...

01:50.744 --> 01:52.611
You know what? Wha...? Hey-hey.

01:52.680 --> 01:53.680
Do you mind?

01:53.747 --> 01:56.115
That is the sword
of St. Ignatius of Loyola,

01:56.183 --> 01:57.583
the founder of the Jesuits.

01:57.651 --> 01:59.518
No kidding?
I mean, it's a replica.

01:59.587 --> 02:03.055
Well, it's a 300-year-old
replica.

02:03.124 --> 02:05.724
Maybe it's not such a good idea
if you guys both stay here.

02:05.793 --> 02:07.326
You know, there's
not a lot of room...

02:07.394 --> 02:09.627
We just need some place
to get our feet under us

02:09.697 --> 02:11.230
until we find Farouk.
No worries.

02:11.298 --> 02:14.333
"Jesuit chic" isn't
exactly my style.

02:14.401 --> 02:17.503
I'll stay at my ex's place.
He's got plenty of room.

02:17.605 --> 02:19.171
Is he in town, or...?

02:19.240 --> 02:21.406
Guess we'll find out.

02:21.475 --> 02:24.810
All right, while you
two figure this out,

02:24.879 --> 02:26.645
I got a class to go teach.

02:26.714 --> 02:29.348
Oh, one more thing.

02:29.416 --> 02:31.450
Bedroom's off limits.

02:31.519 --> 02:33.330
What do you mean?
I mean, under no circumstances

02:33.354 --> 02:35.320
are you two
to have sex in my bed.

02:35.389 --> 02:36.788
Chuck... Dude, I'm serious.

02:36.857 --> 02:38.790
It's not like that.
We're not back together.

02:38.859 --> 02:41.260
I know, but you haven't
seen each other in a while.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.829
Things are fraught,
you're here in Rome,

02:43.898 --> 02:45.964
the adrenaline's pumping. Chuck.

02:46.033 --> 02:48.167
Nothing inappropriate's
gonna happen here.

02:48.235 --> 02:50.469
Chuck, sweetheart,

02:50.538 --> 02:51.803
where do you keep your towels?

02:51.872 --> 02:53.739
Oh, wow! Uh, you've
been here five minutes

02:53.807 --> 02:55.040
and you're already naked.

02:55.109 --> 02:56.875
Excuse me, I haven't
showered in days.

02:58.000 --> 03:04.074
Check out more than 100 online Thai lessons
on BananaThai,  osdb.link/bananathai

03:12.893 --> 03:15.194
Does Chuck have any

03:15.262 --> 03:17.229
fluffier towels?

03:17.298 --> 03:19.464
Gwen wants us
at the Carabinieri.

03:19.533 --> 03:23.335
Pass, unless she's changed
her mind about arresting me.

03:23.404 --> 03:25.470
Yeah, pretty sure
Interpol doesn't send

03:25.539 --> 03:27.639
arrest warrants by text. Fine.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.775
She can wait
until I've showered.

03:31.845 --> 03:33.478
<i>You must be Detective Fabi.</i>

03:34.715 --> 03:36.293
You certainly took your time
getting here.

03:36.317 --> 03:37.783
I just wanted
to look presentable

03:37.851 --> 03:40.252
in case there's
a mug shot involved.

03:40.287 --> 03:42.854
Hey, Quint, long time no see.

03:44.124 --> 03:45.824
Best wheelman in the business
right there.

03:45.893 --> 03:48.594
Lexi, come on. Allegedly.

03:48.662 --> 03:49.728
Thanks for coming in,

03:49.797 --> 03:50.929
finally.

03:50.998 --> 03:52.909
There's been a break
in the Farouk investigation.

03:52.933 --> 03:55.534
From where?
Egyptian intelligence.

03:55.603 --> 03:58.437
This is Asim Masood
from Egypt's G.I.D.,

03:58.505 --> 04:00.606
General Intelligence
Directorate. He's leading

04:00.674 --> 04:03.175
the Egyptian task force on the
pyramid attack. We have met.

04:03.244 --> 04:04.376
Asim.

04:04.445 --> 04:07.112
Agent Gwen Karlsson, Interpol.

04:07.181 --> 04:09.248
Normally, I would've been
informed of your arrival,

04:09.316 --> 04:10.449
but I wasn't, so

04:10.517 --> 04:11.917
you have me at a disadvantage.

04:11.986 --> 04:13.385
They worked together

04:13.454 --> 04:15.554
to bring Farouk down
while Danny was still FBI.

04:15.623 --> 04:18.589
Danny wanted to capture Farouk,
Asim wanted to take him out

04:18.659 --> 04:20.459
with a missile
in a crowded marketplace.

04:20.527 --> 04:22.594
They both lost him.
Now you're all caught up.

04:22.663 --> 04:25.063
Farouk has killed
thousands of people.

04:25.132 --> 04:27.132
The attack on the pyramids
was a slap in the face

04:27.201 --> 04:29.701
to Egypt, to me. To you?

04:29.770 --> 04:31.250
You were the one
who let him get away,

04:31.305 --> 04:33.038
so spare us the <i> macha hara</i>

04:33.107 --> 04:34.473
and tell us what you want.

04:36.644 --> 04:38.910
Yesterday afternoon,
a secure filing box

04:38.979 --> 04:40.779
was taken from
a deep storage facility

04:40.881 --> 04:42.247
in Cyprus when it was raided.

04:42.316 --> 04:43.715
Who did the box belong to?

04:44.852 --> 04:46.118
We'll find out.

04:46.186 --> 04:48.053
We did retrieve some
surveillance footage

04:48.122 --> 04:50.055
from the storage facility

04:50.124 --> 04:52.090
showing an associate
of Karim Farouk.

04:54.528 --> 04:56.295
Can you I.D. him?

04:56.363 --> 04:57.763
Yeah, that's the guy.

04:57.831 --> 04:59.709
Didn't get his name before
he knocked me out of the truck.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.667
What did he take? We can't tell.

05:01.735 --> 05:04.102
Let me see the footage.

05:04.171 --> 05:07.906
Look, Shaw is the key
to finding Farouk.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.676
He's currently recovering
in a medical unit,

05:10.744 --> 05:12.244
wants a deal to talk.

05:12.313 --> 05:14.346
Which is taking some convincing
with my bosses.

05:14.415 --> 05:16.448
I'm about to make a case
to the general himself.

05:16.517 --> 05:19.318
I read the report.
This Shaw person is a complete

05:19.386 --> 05:20.552
waste of time.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.821
We should be focusing on
this guy, Farouk's lieutenant.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.489
I literally punched that jerk

05:24.558 --> 05:26.925
in the face less
than 72 hours ago.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.527
This grainy-ass picture
is as close

05:28.595 --> 05:30.462
as you've gotten,
so how about we go

05:30.531 --> 05:32.664
with our plan?
Feel free to pursue your investigation

05:32.733 --> 05:35.200
however you like.
I will pursue things my way.

05:35.269 --> 05:36.702
Okay, that's your prerogative.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.537
Bear in mind,
you're a guest in this country.

05:38.605 --> 05:40.372
You are all guests
in this country.

05:40.441 --> 05:42.174
Lexi,

05:42.242 --> 05:45.043
look.

05:45.112 --> 05:46.044
The picture he's holding.

05:46.113 --> 05:47.846
That's Cleopatra.

05:47.915 --> 05:50.949
There's something written on it.
I can't make it out.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.684
Asim,

05:52.753 --> 05:55.554
the only success
we've ever had finding Farouk

05:55.622 --> 05:57.956
is by tracking
his blood antiquity network.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.158
Now, like it or not,

06:00.227 --> 06:01.526
this is a treasure hunt.

06:01.595 --> 06:02.761
Two days ago, we caught Shaw

06:02.830 --> 06:05.163
fencing the loot Farouk took
from the pyramid.

06:05.232 --> 06:07.566
Farouk was planning
to pay Shaw somehow.

06:07.634 --> 06:10.168
Let's follow the money
back to Farouk.

06:36.430 --> 06:38.063
I'm here to see the prisoner.

06:38.132 --> 06:39.264
Right in here, sir.

06:45.239 --> 06:47.372
It's all over for the Reich,
Herr Colonel.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.121
Only thing standing
between the Allies

06:51.145 --> 06:53.011
and Berlin are a couple of

06:53.080 --> 06:55.258
Von Runstedt's Panzer Divisions
on the other side of the Marne.

06:55.282 --> 06:58.884
Now...

06:58.952 --> 07:02.854
you tell me where,

07:02.923 --> 07:06.525
maybe we can all be home
in time for Christmas.

07:08.629 --> 07:11.863
Von Runstedt's Panzers

07:11.932 --> 07:13.865
are not your problem, Captain.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.600
What is my problem, Colonel?

07:15.669 --> 07:17.202
She is.

07:17.271 --> 07:19.871
Cleopatra.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.574
The last queen of Egypt,

07:22.643 --> 07:26.278
and perhaps the greatest
archaeological find in history.

07:26.346 --> 07:30.148
She is in our hands now.

07:30.217 --> 07:32.384
But I can tell you where she is.

07:32.453 --> 07:35.821
Well, how about that?

07:35.889 --> 07:38.089
She's fascinating,

07:38.158 --> 07:40.091
but I don't see
how she's my problem.

07:42.396 --> 07:44.596
Because of what they're
going to do with her.

07:44.631 --> 07:45.764
They?

07:45.833 --> 07:47.933
The S.S.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.435
You're right that the war
will soon be over,

07:50.504 --> 07:54.906
but it is you
who will be defeated

07:54.975 --> 07:58.810
by a power the world
has never seen,

07:58.879 --> 08:02.514
unless you secure my release.

08:04.685 --> 08:07.652
Well, I don't know
about all that,

08:07.721 --> 08:09.955
but she's definitely
worth looking into.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.690
I'll run it up the chain.

08:11.758 --> 08:13.692
You sit tight, I'll be back.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.966
Keep an eye on him.

08:28.509 --> 08:29.841
Light?

09:31.305 --> 09:32.737
Aw.

09:32.806 --> 09:35.373
Look at him. He's adorable.

09:35.442 --> 09:37.075
Maybe we should let Shaw rest.

09:37.144 --> 09:40.278
No time, but I saw this
in a movie once.

09:40.347 --> 09:42.225
They stabbed this woman
in the heart with adrenaline,

09:42.249 --> 09:44.916
she woke up fast. I don't know.

09:44.985 --> 09:47.686
Shaw's pretty big.
You might need two.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.554
Good point.

09:49.623 --> 09:51.890
Okay, here goes nothing.

09:51.959 --> 09:53.625
Stop! I'm awake, damn it.

09:53.694 --> 09:57.295
Are you insane?
I'm supposed to be resting.

09:57.364 --> 09:58.641
Then I'll cut straight
to the point.

09:58.665 --> 10:00.944
Karim Farouk is on the run
and you're our only link to him.

10:00.968 --> 10:03.368
<i>Pulp Fiction.</i> What?

10:03.437 --> 10:05.348
That's the movie where the girl
gets stabbed in the heart

10:05.372 --> 10:06.805
with adrenaline. Maybe.

10:06.873 --> 10:08.273
No, it-it definitely is.

10:08.342 --> 10:10.375
Yeah, he's right.
But what's the point?

10:10.444 --> 10:12.077
The point is,
that's the only information

10:12.145 --> 10:14.946
you're getting out of me
until I get immunity.

10:15.015 --> 10:17.282
Oh, I can still stab you with these.
No, you won't.

10:17.351 --> 10:19.884
I've seen your deal.
He's good cop, you're bad cop.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.486
He won't let you hurt me.

10:21.555 --> 10:22.921
You see what you've done?

10:22.990 --> 10:25.423
Now I have to stab him
to keep my cred.

10:25.492 --> 10:27.759
Shaw, we're not the ones
you need to worry about.

10:27.828 --> 10:30.161
Farouk's already tried
to kill you twice.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.631
You want the third time to be the charm?
Uh, yeah,

10:32.699 --> 10:35.066
and how is he supposed
to do that with all

10:35.135 --> 10:37.302
those cops out there
protecting me?

10:37.371 --> 10:38.881
They did just let me almost
stab you in the heart

10:38.905 --> 10:40.071
with adrenaline.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.473
That is a fair point.

10:41.541 --> 10:42.974
The only way you survive

10:43.043 --> 10:44.776
is working with us.

10:44.845 --> 10:47.145
<i>Farouk was paying Shaw</i>

10:47.214 --> 10:50.081
through a hawala transaction
in Paris.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.916
So it's a dead end.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.819
Hawala's an ancient system
of undocumented money transfers,

10:54.888 --> 10:56.254
based on honor code.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.756
There is no transaction record,

10:57.824 --> 10:59.791
no paper trail
to follow to Farouk.

10:59.860 --> 11:02.527
Shaw goes to a hawaladar
with the right password,

11:02.596 --> 11:04.763
and a predetermined amount
changes hands.

11:04.831 --> 11:08.199
The banker and the sender
settle up after, right?

11:08.268 --> 11:10.368
Yes. So here's the plan.

11:10.437 --> 11:13.271
We go to the hawaladar,
use Shaw's password.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.640
Now, Farouk wants Shaw dead,
so trying to claim the money

11:15.709 --> 11:17.375
should trigger a call to him.

11:17.444 --> 11:19.355
Will they think Shaw is dumb
enough to collect the money

11:19.379 --> 11:20.779
after Farouk shot him?

11:20.847 --> 11:22.881
Oh, I think we're good
on that front.

11:25.719 --> 11:29.020
Yeah, let's trace a call,
get Farouk's location.

11:29.089 --> 11:31.222
It's a great plan.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.124
Did you get the password? I did.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.326
What is it? <i>Wa enta Malak.</i>

11:35.395 --> 11:37.162
That means
"None of your business."

11:37.230 --> 11:39.497
Does it? Hmm.

11:39.566 --> 11:41.332
Lexi got Shaw
to give the password

11:41.401 --> 11:43.041
just to her, uh,
he's got kind of a crush.

11:44.237 --> 11:45.737
Hmm.

11:45.806 --> 11:48.640
Guess we're all going to Paris.

11:48.709 --> 11:51.843
Farouk, as requested.

11:55.282 --> 11:57.215
Well done, Omar.

12:15.969 --> 12:17.569
Hmm.

12:17.637 --> 12:20.572
Cleopatra was taken to Germany.

12:31.184 --> 12:34.018
Soon we will have
everything we need.

12:50.504 --> 12:52.203
Can Shaw see us?

12:52.272 --> 12:53.705
He can see.

12:53.774 --> 12:56.041
I cannot see. Hand over

12:56.109 --> 12:57.287
them giant-ass binoculars
you got,

12:57.311 --> 13:00.011
and maybe I can I.D. the man.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.180
Hey, don't touch.
They're very expensive.

13:02.249 --> 13:03.960
Just so you know, the way
you're treating me right now

13:03.984 --> 13:05.684
isn't good for team morale.

13:05.752 --> 13:08.286
You're not on the team.
Just I.D. the banker.

13:12.759 --> 13:14.292
Uh, could you adjust the focus?

13:14.361 --> 13:16.094
Hmm...

13:17.197 --> 13:18.730
He had a beard.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.635
Can you be a little bit

13:23.704 --> 13:24.903
more specific?

13:24.972 --> 13:26.371
Old guy,

13:26.440 --> 13:28.039
wears dark glasses, even inside.

13:28.108 --> 13:29.240
Copy that.

13:29.309 --> 13:32.444
Heading inside.

13:32.512 --> 13:37.282
Inside, 15 paces south,
turning west.

13:37.351 --> 13:39.284
Let me handle him.

13:47.361 --> 13:51.329
Are you the man
selling Skinjbeer?

13:51.398 --> 13:53.832
Skinjbeer.

13:55.402 --> 13:58.937
That would make you
Mr. Shaw, then, yes?

13:59.006 --> 14:02.173
That's me. Mr. Shaw.

14:02.242 --> 14:03.775
And that would make you...

14:03.844 --> 14:04.844
Eager to get on with it.

14:18.392 --> 14:19.758
Mr. Shaw,

14:19.826 --> 14:24.162
seeking remittance for
a transaction dating back to...

14:28.735 --> 14:30.135
One moment.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.871
You ready to start the trace?

14:32.939 --> 14:35.140
Agent Danny from FBI.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.275
Ooh...

14:37.344 --> 14:39.778
Agent Danny, it's me, Marwan.
You remember? From Iraq.

14:39.846 --> 14:41.179
You saved my life.

14:41.248 --> 14:42.313
This is not good.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.149
I was interpreter for his FBI.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.550
Best one they had.

14:45.619 --> 14:48.219
Danny secured exit visas
for my family.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.266
I think you have the wrong person.
Yeah, you're mistaken, friend.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.856
I-I guess I just have

14:51.925 --> 14:53.691
: One of those faces. Mistaken?

14:53.760 --> 14:55.660
I named my youngest child
after you.

14:56.930 --> 14:58.163
Th-This is...

14:58.231 --> 14:59.531
not what it looks like.

15:01.134 --> 15:02.667
This is why

15:02.736 --> 15:04.903
you should never
be nice to people.

15:07.808 --> 15:09.474
My nephews.

15:09.543 --> 15:11.209
With apologies,

15:11.278 --> 15:14.145
Agent Danny.

15:57.858 --> 15:59.691
I think we kind of got off
on the wrong food.

16:15.408 --> 16:16.408
Ooh.

16:20.614 --> 16:22.213
Where's the banker?

16:22.282 --> 16:24.282
Has anyone seen Lexi?

16:30.390 --> 16:32.757
Get off me!

16:34.494 --> 16:36.427
: He's surprisingly spry.

16:41.168 --> 16:43.101
Bloody hell.

16:52.546 --> 16:54.746
Any luck? He got away.

16:54.814 --> 16:56.147
You all right?

16:56.216 --> 16:58.683
Things got out of hand fast.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.353
Your plan almost worked.

17:02.422 --> 17:04.521
Hey, thanks for having
my back in there.

17:04.590 --> 17:06.958
Well, we would both be dead
if it wasn't for Agent Karlsson.

17:07.027 --> 17:09.594
Well, I'd feel better if we
got more for our efforts.

17:09.663 --> 17:11.029
: You are so Swedish.

17:11.097 --> 17:12.864
Well, we didn't get
the phone trace,

17:12.933 --> 17:14.911
but maybe one of these nephews
will give something up.

17:14.935 --> 17:16.311
Already started
the extradition paperwork.

17:16.336 --> 17:17.713
We'll bring them back to Rome
as part

17:17.737 --> 17:18.857
of the Farouk investigation?

17:18.905 --> 17:21.806
Uh, where's Shaw?

17:21.875 --> 17:23.808
In there.

17:31.585 --> 17:32.884
He stole my binoculars.

17:32.953 --> 17:35.053
You have to admire
the man's consistency.

17:35.121 --> 17:37.055
"Admire" is a strong word.

17:37.123 --> 17:39.691
All right, let's wrap this up
and get back to Rome.

17:39.759 --> 17:40.992
Asim, I'm still waiting

17:41.061 --> 17:43.628
for your special assignment
paperwork from G.I.D.?

17:43.697 --> 17:45.330
I need it if you are
going to continue

17:45.398 --> 17:46.965
to work on this investigation.

17:47.033 --> 17:49.300
I'll see what the holdup is.

17:51.805 --> 17:54.172
So that old guy
really outran you?

17:54.241 --> 17:56.507
He was surprisingly spry.

17:56.576 --> 17:59.043
Huh. But I got his ledger.

17:59.112 --> 18:01.913
All the hawaladar transactions
in one place.

18:01.982 --> 18:03.348
What kind of code is this?

18:03.416 --> 18:04.816
No idea.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.195
But it'll be worth
its weight in gold

18:06.219 --> 18:07.518
as soon as we figure it out.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.354
Interpol can help us crack it.

18:09.422 --> 18:12.590
Let's keep it between us
for now.

18:12.659 --> 18:15.893
Look, I've just...
I've been thinking.

18:15.962 --> 18:17.528
The Egyptians have now
been involved

18:17.597 --> 18:20.265
in two separate
failed operations on Farouk.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.667
You think Farouk has a mole
inside Egyptian intelligence?

18:22.736 --> 18:24.402
Remember that capture mission,

18:24.471 --> 18:25.948
when Farouk's car
suddenly changed course

18:25.972 --> 18:27.905
and veered
into some populated area?

18:27.974 --> 18:30.541
Yeah. Asim was there.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.343
Yeah, exactly.

18:32.412 --> 18:35.446
And now he showed up
in some brand-new investigation

18:35.515 --> 18:37.081
with no official paperwork?

18:37.150 --> 18:38.516
When it comes to Farouk,

18:38.585 --> 18:40.551
there's no one I trust
outside of you and me.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.388
And definitely not Asim.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.126
So none of you
<i>are going to talk, huh?</i>

18:50.429 --> 18:52.229
Want to speak, or no?

19:03.442 --> 19:05.876
Every one of them
is silent as the grave.

19:05.944 --> 19:08.211
They could teach
the mafia about omertà.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.247
None of these guys
are going to talk.

19:10.315 --> 19:11.635
They're not going
to betray family

19:11.683 --> 19:13.250
unless properly leveraged.

19:13.318 --> 19:14.558
I'm hoping "properly leveraged"

19:14.620 --> 19:16.153
doesn't mean
what I think it means.

19:16.221 --> 19:18.221
My point is, they should
be questioned in Egypt.

19:18.290 --> 19:20.257
Anything we get
out of them under torture

19:20.325 --> 19:22.926
is inadmissible in court.

19:22.995 --> 19:25.695
Look, I'd, I'd like to try
talking with them.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.265
You can observe only.

19:37.809 --> 19:39.709
Geez. Ah, oh...

19:39.778 --> 19:41.578
Father Chuck.

19:41.647 --> 19:44.381
I've made some tea if you'd
like some. You look tired.

19:44.449 --> 19:48.218
I distinctly recall telling
Danny to use good judgment,

19:48.287 --> 19:50.453
and that does not include
giving you my key.

19:50.522 --> 19:51.688
You did.

19:51.757 --> 19:54.457
And he didn't. So you broke in.

19:54.526 --> 19:57.527
The lock is so flimsy, I would
barely consider it breaking in.

19:57.596 --> 19:58.876
You finding everything you need?

19:58.931 --> 19:59.941
Snack selection
was underwhelming.

19:59.965 --> 20:01.464
Oh, I'm sorry.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.511
Well, next time you plan on
breaking in, let me know

20:03.535 --> 20:05.202
and I'll set out
a charcuterie plate.

20:05.270 --> 20:06.803
What is that?

20:06.872 --> 20:09.906
This is a ledger we got
from a hawaladar in Paris

20:09.975 --> 20:12.108
that has encoded transactions
with Farouk.

20:12.177 --> 20:13.910
I'm gonna need, like,
five minutes

20:13.979 --> 20:15.412
to process that sentence.

20:15.480 --> 20:16.613
Simple

20:16.682 --> 20:18.248
I crack this code,

20:18.317 --> 20:20.383
we get a step closer to Farouk.

20:23.555 --> 20:26.256
FATHER
Looks like a dead language.

20:26.325 --> 20:27.891
Exactly what I was thinking.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.492
Thus, I broke into
your place to access

20:29.561 --> 20:31.761
your extensive collection
of old-timey books.

20:31.830 --> 20:34.664
All right, just so
I'm keeping track.

20:34.733 --> 20:36.800
Breaking into my bad.

20:36.868 --> 20:40.537
Trying to stop good.

20:40.606 --> 20:43.640
I guess, in this case, the
good outweighs the bad.

20:45.744 --> 20:47.143
So you're helping?

20:47.212 --> 20:49.679
Yeah, I mean,
I'm no Magnum P.I.,

20:49.748 --> 20:52.182
but if it's just comparing
things, I can do that.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.618
Well, I appreciate it.

20:59.091 --> 21:02.692
It's strange to me that Danny's
never mentioned you,

21:02.761 --> 21:04.461
considering how close
you two are.

21:04.529 --> 21:07.464
Well, Danny's a complicated guy.

21:07.532 --> 21:10.800
He follows rules and does
the right thing unfailingly.

21:10.869 --> 21:12.702
He's the furthest thing
from complicated.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.537
Okay.

21:14.606 --> 21:18.208
: What? Am I wrong?

21:18.277 --> 21:20.844
You and Danny have a lot more
in common than you think.

21:20.912 --> 21:23.580
How do you figure?

21:23.615 --> 21:26.483
Something tells me you're not
ready to wade into these waters.

21:26.551 --> 21:29.286
No, I don't want to talk
about me, I want dirt on Danny.

21:29.354 --> 21:30.987
Somebody here could use a drink.

21:31.056 --> 21:32.555
I think I can handle it.

21:32.624 --> 21:34.557
I wasn't talking about you.

21:37.229 --> 21:39.296
Where is Karim Farouk?

21:39.364 --> 21:42.532
I'm telling you, I don't know
who you're talking about.

21:42.601 --> 21:44.567
You do realize you're
facing assault charges

21:44.636 --> 21:48.571
on law enforcement,
as well as terrorism charges,

21:48.640 --> 21:50.573
yeah?

21:51.743 --> 21:54.511
I'm not a terrorist.

21:54.546 --> 21:56.680
You are involved in
the financing of terrorists,

21:56.748 --> 21:59.268
which means there are different
rules for how we can charge you,

21:59.318 --> 22:01.418
where we can send you,
and I don't mean France.

22:05.924 --> 22:07.490
You're afraid of him, huh?

22:09.094 --> 22:12.662
You should be afraid of him.

22:12.731 --> 22:15.765
He's here because
of the pyramid attack.

22:15.834 --> 22:18.435
I can turn you over to G.I.D.

22:19.971 --> 22:21.705
Tell me, Khalid,

22:21.773 --> 22:25.608
what do you think they will
do to you in Egypt, huh?

22:28.113 --> 22:30.513
What do you think
he will do to you?

22:37.789 --> 22:40.757
I've got an idea. Be right back.

22:40.826 --> 22:43.526
Danny and I find a case
of sacramental wine.

22:43.595 --> 22:47.464
So the next morning, we wake up
on the floor of the sacristy,

22:47.532 --> 22:50.867
and Sister Charlene
is screaming so loud.

22:50.936 --> 22:52.902
I swear my ears
are still ringing.

22:52.971 --> 22:55.972
I can't picture Danny doing any of this.
Yeah, well,

22:56.041 --> 22:58.375
we got all the stupid
out of us early.

22:58.443 --> 23:00.643
Ugh, I got to lay
off this hooch.

23:00.712 --> 23:03.646
I can't tell whether this
is some ancient language

23:03.715 --> 23:06.950
or English at this point.

23:07.018 --> 23:10.787
That is Coptic.
My mom had a bible like that.

23:10.856 --> 23:14.624
Your mom was a Coptic Christian?

23:14.693 --> 23:18.661
Dad was Muslim. I was, um,
you know, caught in the middle.

23:18.730 --> 23:21.297
That couldn't have been easy.

23:21.366 --> 23:23.600
After my mom died,
I didn't believe in any of it,

23:23.668 --> 23:25.735
so that cleared
everything right up.

23:28.306 --> 23:31.074
Out of curiosity, how old
were you when your ma died?

23:31.143 --> 23:33.843
I was eight.

23:33.912 --> 23:36.679
Is that when you
started stealing?

23:36.748 --> 23:39.616
Why?

23:39.684 --> 23:41.618
Childhood abandonment

23:41.686 --> 23:44.254
leaves a person feeling unsafe,

23:44.322 --> 23:46.790
so they assert control
however they can.

23:46.858 --> 23:49.459
You know, they see a-a thing
they want, they take it.

23:49.528 --> 23:52.028
They see a door that's
locked, they open it.

23:52.097 --> 23:56.366
It's their way of saying to the
world, "You don't control me."

23:58.503 --> 24:01.171
Doesn't sound familiar.

24:04.709 --> 24:05.842
Oh.

24:05.911 --> 24:09.379
Wait a minute, these two
languages are the same.

24:09.448 --> 24:13.049
We may have a winner.

24:13.118 --> 24:15.518
The ledger's in Sumerian.

24:15.587 --> 24:19.289
Huh. Oh, and with that,

24:19.357 --> 24:22.392
confession is over.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.461
What, no penance?

24:27.132 --> 24:28.498
You want penance?

24:30.035 --> 24:32.969
Don't break Danny's heart...

24:33.038 --> 24:34.337
again.

24:43.248 --> 24:47.050
Gwen, can I have
a minute with him?

24:47.118 --> 24:49.052
Think it's worth a try.

24:50.255 --> 24:53.423
I'm fascinated
by the hawala system.

24:54.759 --> 24:57.227
It's been in place
for over a thousand years,

24:57.295 --> 24:59.329
enabling trade
along the Silk Road,

24:59.397 --> 25:00.997
outlasting empires,

25:01.066 --> 25:03.199
helping give birth to the
modern financial system...

25:05.804 --> 25:08.204
Based on nothing more
than an ironclad honor code.

25:08.273 --> 25:09.372
It's still in place,

25:09.441 --> 25:11.241
even today.

25:11.309 --> 25:14.010
Hawala means "exchange"
in Arabic,

25:14.079 --> 25:18.781
but its original meaning
is "trust" in Hindi.

25:18.850 --> 25:21.050
The whole hawala system is built

25:21.119 --> 25:23.786
on that one trust.

25:23.855 --> 25:26.089
So I get

25:26.157 --> 25:29.058
why you don't want
to give us any information.

25:29.127 --> 25:31.694
I understand that we're
asking you to violate

25:31.763 --> 25:33.062
your most deeply held beliefs...

25:35.200 --> 25:37.200
your most sacred code.

25:38.803 --> 25:42.605
Except I'm not the one asking
you to violate anything.

25:42.641 --> 25:43.973
Karim Farouk is.

25:44.042 --> 25:45.975
Karim Farouk.

25:46.044 --> 25:49.445
The oil pipeline in Dakar.

25:49.514 --> 25:53.449
Office tower in Malaysia.
Airbus over the Atlantic.

25:53.518 --> 25:55.952
Countless villages
raided and ransacked.

25:56.021 --> 25:58.588
Pyramids destroyed.
Thousands of men,

25:58.657 --> 26:00.957
women, and children murdered

26:01.026 --> 26:03.726
by a butcher who you
are now protecting.

26:12.904 --> 26:14.837
My uncle says...

26:16.241 --> 26:18.274
He says dealing
with undesirable customers

26:18.343 --> 26:19.576
is a part of doing business.

26:19.644 --> 26:20.810
Karim Farouk

26:20.879 --> 26:22.345
is demonstrably evil.

26:22.414 --> 26:25.315
How honorable is it
to protect a man without honor?

26:25.383 --> 26:28.184
What kind of code
shields a man like Farouk

26:28.253 --> 26:30.620
while leaving his future victims
without any protection?

26:30.689 --> 26:33.456
I have nothing but contempt
for men like Farouk.

26:33.525 --> 26:36.926
Men who kill and maim innocents
in the name of the Prophet.

26:36.995 --> 26:39.862
They tar us one and
all with these acts.

27:20.939 --> 27:22.705
I will give you
the information you need

27:22.774 --> 27:23.973
to help you in your search.

27:26.044 --> 27:28.378
An honorable transaction

27:28.446 --> 27:30.380
with an honorable man.

27:33.118 --> 27:34.984
<i>Khalid said
there have been a number</i>

27:35.053 --> 27:36.386
of transactions.

27:36.454 --> 27:38.488
Antiquities in exchange for cash

27:38.556 --> 27:40.857
right here in Rome.
You think that's Farouk?

27:40.925 --> 27:42.925
Think he might have
a safe house here, yeah.

27:42.994 --> 27:47.230
Unfortunately,
Khalid doesn't have the address.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.933
Control issues?

27:51.002 --> 27:52.535
Oh, Lexi.

27:52.604 --> 27:54.237
What is it?

27:54.305 --> 27:56.205
She got the address.

27:56.274 --> 27:57.540
From where?

27:57.609 --> 28:00.043
It's a long story, but
she's headed there now.

28:00.111 --> 28:01.956
Well, it's too late to get
a warrant. We'll check it out

28:01.980 --> 28:03.780
in the morning, no?
I'm gonna meet her there

28:03.848 --> 28:06.049
just to be safe.
Don't do anything stupid.

28:06.117 --> 28:09.185
Or, more likely, don't let her
do anything stupid.

28:09.254 --> 28:10.453
Just observe.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.021
Of course.

28:17.762 --> 28:19.095
I'm coming with you.

28:19.164 --> 28:21.764
Yeah, I'm okay on my own.
Thanks. I'm not asking.

28:21.833 --> 28:23.099
I insist.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.975
Lexi says this pyramid
<i>is the location</i>

28:32.043 --> 28:33.443
of the dead drop site.

28:33.511 --> 28:37.313
The tomb of Caius
Cestius, 12 B.C.

28:37.382 --> 28:39.148
Rome conquered Egypt,

28:39.217 --> 28:41.718
and suddenly everything Egyptian

28:41.786 --> 28:44.654
got really fashionable in Rome.

28:44.723 --> 28:47.090
And thus began the
Western appropriation

28:47.158 --> 28:48.892
of our cultural heritage.

28:52.464 --> 28:53.997
Well, if the exchanges
happened here,

28:54.065 --> 28:55.999
the safe house would be
nearby to monitor them.

28:56.067 --> 28:57.467
Lots of decent options,

28:57.535 --> 28:59.736
all with a clear view
of this square.

28:59.804 --> 29:02.171
That's too obvious.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.607
There's no clear line of sight.

29:07.979 --> 29:09.913
It should be one of those.

29:11.316 --> 29:13.316
Hey, maybe you could,
uh, wait here

29:13.385 --> 29:15.418
in case Lexi shows up.

29:15.487 --> 29:17.687
Why are you always
trying to lose me?

29:17.756 --> 29:19.756
I know you well enough
not to suspect you

29:19.824 --> 29:21.958
of working for Farouk...

29:22.027 --> 29:24.127
which means you suspect me.

29:25.230 --> 29:27.430
Just being cautious.

29:40.879 --> 29:42.845
Spotting a pair
of strangers below.

29:42.914 --> 29:45.782
Looks like they're trying
to make our location.

29:45.850 --> 29:47.183
Orders?

29:47.252 --> 29:48.618
Describe them.

29:48.687 --> 29:51.220
One Arab, one Yankee.
Both reek of cop.

29:51.289 --> 29:52.555
If they make a move,

29:52.624 --> 29:54.023
take them out.

29:54.092 --> 29:55.558
Copy that.

29:58.730 --> 30:01.397
Your special assignment
paperwork ever come through?

30:04.903 --> 30:07.670
Are you even supposed
to be here?

30:07.739 --> 30:10.039
No. I'm not.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.409
That day we had Farouk
in our sights...

30:13.478 --> 30:16.012
he veered off course so quickly.

30:16.081 --> 30:19.015
I think someone warned him.

30:19.084 --> 30:21.184
You think someone in
the Egyptian government?

30:21.252 --> 30:23.486
Yes.

30:23.555 --> 30:26.089
Look, as angry as you might be
about what happened then

30:26.157 --> 30:28.257
and what happened
at the pyramids,

30:28.326 --> 30:30.360
imagine how I feel

30:30.428 --> 30:33.563
when it's happening
in my own country.

30:33.631 --> 30:34.764
I know what you're thinking.

30:34.833 --> 30:37.266
<i>If I am the mole,</i>

30:37.335 --> 30:39.268
it's a good play for me
to accuse someone else.

30:41.639 --> 30:43.573
I know why
you wouldn't trust me.

30:45.143 --> 30:49.212
But every time
I get close to him...

30:49.280 --> 30:51.614
I hit a wall.

30:53.518 --> 30:55.551
There's no way
I can do this on my own.

30:55.620 --> 30:58.688
And there's no one I trust more
to have my back.

31:01.493 --> 31:02.692
All right.

31:02.761 --> 31:05.661
Let's go in, get
the lay of the land.

31:05.730 --> 31:06.863
Maybe ask some questions.

31:11.803 --> 31:13.302
In case we don't like
the answers.

31:18.877 --> 31:20.376
Farouk's safe house!

31:20.445 --> 31:21.878
Fourth floor!

31:21.946 --> 31:23.246
Meet you inside!

31:33.658 --> 31:35.058
Cover me! I'm going in!

31:42.033 --> 31:43.099
Do you see Lexi?

32:01.553 --> 32:03.152
Let's get out of here!
Follow me!

32:26.411 --> 32:27.877
Lexi!

32:30.348 --> 32:31.481
Asim.

32:31.549 --> 32:33.483
Asim!

32:33.551 --> 32:35.518
Asim. Hey.

32:35.587 --> 32:37.487
Asim! I'll call in.

32:37.555 --> 32:38.488
Hold on.

32:38.556 --> 32:40.389
Please stay with us.

32:44.362 --> 32:45.895
: You...

32:45.964 --> 32:48.231
finish this.

32:48.299 --> 32:50.500
Promise.

32:50.568 --> 32:52.502
I promise.

32:55.807 --> 32:57.406
For our country.

32:58.476 --> 33:00.409
I will.

33:44.230 --> 33:46.531
Thought I'd find you here.

33:46.599 --> 33:48.633
Last time I saw you like this,

33:48.701 --> 33:52.203
Mrs. Kowalski's Impala
got the window smashed in.

33:55.542 --> 33:56.874
Come on, batter up.

33:59.913 --> 34:02.080
'Less you don't think you
can hit my slider anymore.

34:02.148 --> 34:03.915
You mean that garbage fastball

34:03.983 --> 34:05.883
you cover with hair gel? Hey.

34:05.952 --> 34:07.885
My technique was the only thing

34:07.954 --> 34:09.821
that could stop those
cheaters from St. Luke's.

34:09.889 --> 34:13.658
God, I've never seen so many
12-year-olds with mustaches.

34:35.648 --> 34:36.746
Hey, kiss off, A-Rod.

34:36.815 --> 34:38.116
Oh! Oh!

34:38.184 --> 34:39.583
Ouch!

34:39.652 --> 34:42.186
Oh, that hurts
on so many levels.

34:42.255 --> 34:44.889
Well,
they're leaving me no choice.

34:44.958 --> 34:46.591
Yeah. You even asked nicely.

34:46.659 --> 34:49.927
I almost feel bad for them.

34:52.465 --> 34:53.563
FATHER God loves you.

34:59.973 --> 35:02.406
Are you ready for the pain?

35:02.475 --> 35:05.610
Just try to get it remotely
over the plate, Wild Thing.

35:07.514 --> 35:08.514
Ah...

35:20.126 --> 35:21.559
Boom!

35:21.628 --> 35:23.561
All right, all right.

35:23.630 --> 35:25.129
Maybe this one'll shut you up.

35:28.501 --> 35:29.600
Boom!

35:29.669 --> 35:33.905
It goes deep over
the Green Monster!

35:33.973 --> 35:35.840
Hey, listen, um...

35:35.909 --> 35:37.675
Listen, I was thinking.

35:39.579 --> 35:42.079
Why don't you stay with me
in Rome a little while longer?

35:42.148 --> 35:44.782
Yeah? Yeah.

35:44.851 --> 35:47.485
I'll even let your
grifter girlfriend visit.

35:47.554 --> 35:48.953
Ah...

35:51.191 --> 35:53.758
She's not...
she's not my girlfriend.

35:54.827 --> 35:56.294
Shut up.

35:56.362 --> 35:58.930
Look,

35:58.998 --> 36:00.464
I don't know what she is.

36:00.533 --> 36:02.033
All I know is...

36:02.101 --> 36:05.603
somebody's got to stop this guy,
and I can't do it alone.

36:05.672 --> 36:08.906
And she's gonna try
and do it herself anyway,

36:08.942 --> 36:10.942
and she's gonna get hurt.

36:11.010 --> 36:16.047
And if anything happened
to her, I don't know, I...

36:16.115 --> 36:17.315
Wait. What?

36:20.286 --> 36:23.020
Not cool. Not cool.

36:23.089 --> 36:25.056
I'm going to, uh...

36:25.124 --> 36:26.224
I'm gonna go shag balls.

36:27.293 --> 36:30.027
Bye.

36:33.733 --> 36:35.566
How are you?

36:35.635 --> 36:38.469
Well, I got to remember
to keep my elbow up.

36:38.538 --> 36:40.182
You know, swing through the ball
a little bit more.

36:40.206 --> 36:41.539
I meant about today.

36:43.109 --> 36:45.042
I know.

36:46.779 --> 36:48.746
I was wrong.

36:48.815 --> 36:50.748
I feel...

36:50.817 --> 36:53.751
terrible about suspecting Asim.

36:53.820 --> 36:56.520
He was just trying to
stop Farouk, same as us.

36:56.589 --> 36:58.256
He didn't die in vain.

36:58.324 --> 37:02.560
I mean, finding one of Farouk's
safe houses is a big deal.

37:02.629 --> 37:04.762
It'll force him
to alter his plans.

37:04.831 --> 37:07.365
He'll start making mistakes.
How do you know?

37:07.433 --> 37:09.567
That's how I found him
the first time.

37:10.670 --> 37:12.603
This should also help.

37:15.975 --> 37:17.842
Where did you get this?

37:17.910 --> 37:19.610
Farouk's safe house.

37:19.679 --> 37:21.212
Grabbed it at the firefight.

37:21.281 --> 37:24.015
"Bavaria, 1944."

37:24.083 --> 37:26.751
The Nazis got Cleopatra
to Germany.

37:29.756 --> 37:31.756
Look, I've been thinking.

37:31.824 --> 37:34.925
Asim said something before
we breached the safe house

37:34.994 --> 37:39.263
about Egyptian culture
being appropriated by the West.

37:39.332 --> 37:41.932
Now the same goes
for Cleopatra and Antony.

37:42.001 --> 37:43.901
They were a symbol for both.

37:43.970 --> 37:46.304
But their union led to a war
between East and West,

37:46.372 --> 37:49.240
and ultimately brought down
the Egyptian dynasty.

37:49.309 --> 37:53.311
Now, Farouk's attacks always
have an element of symbolism.

37:53.379 --> 37:56.781
Maybe reuniting them is all part
of a plan to drive East and West

37:56.849 --> 37:58.449
into an all-out war.

37:58.518 --> 38:00.151
Farouk went to a lot of effort

38:00.219 --> 38:01.786
to get that photograph.

38:01.854 --> 38:03.954
He's gonna go to wherever
it was taken. Yeah.

38:04.023 --> 38:06.557
Narrowing it down will take
some work, but we'll find it.

38:06.626 --> 38:08.426
We'll find him.

38:08.494 --> 38:11.562
Danny, don't worry about me.

38:11.631 --> 38:13.597
This time I'll be ready.

38:15.702 --> 38:17.968
Yeah.

38:22.342 --> 38:24.308
Wh-When you texted me before,

38:24.377 --> 38:25.743
you said something about...

38:25.812 --> 38:27.278
not having control issues?

38:27.347 --> 38:29.280
What-what was that?

38:29.349 --> 38:31.582
Stupid Chuck.

38:31.651 --> 38:33.584
He's all in my head now.

38:33.653 --> 38:35.252
He says we have control issues.

38:35.321 --> 38:36.654
<i>Both</i> of us.

38:36.723 --> 38:38.255
Chuck thinks a lot of things.

38:38.324 --> 38:40.691
Did he tell you
his theory on Amelia Earhart?

38:40.760 --> 38:43.260
Fabi, was it Asim Masood?

38:43.329 --> 38:45.129
Masood was not
the mole in Egypt.

38:45.198 --> 38:47.131
There's only one option left.

38:48.668 --> 38:51.168
They're on their way to Germany,
as is Farouk.

38:51.237 --> 38:53.838
We'll be ready,
