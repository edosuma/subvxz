00:02.303 --> 00:03.435
Paige Collins, will you marry me?

00:03.437 --> 00:05.204
- Yes!
- Yes?

00:05.206 --> 00:07.005
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:08.274 --> 00:11.143
- We've got to break up.
- Excuse me?

00:11.145 --> 00:15.380
I'm leaving, and it's making
it really hard for me to go.

00:15.382 --> 00:17.082
Jack, your white blood cell count

00:17.084 --> 00:18.217
came back slightly abnormal.

00:18.219 --> 00:20.485
- Abnormal?
- No need for alarm.

00:20.487 --> 00:22.721
Alarm never entered my mind.

00:24.424 --> 00:25.524
This is Dr. Lawson.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.192
I'm at 1 Cayne Court

00:27.194 --> 00:28.927
with a 35-year-old male.

00:28.929 --> 00:31.863
He was mistakenly given oral steroids.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.599
I want to offer my resignation.

00:33.601 --> 00:35.033
I accept.

00:35.035 --> 00:40.839
Dr. Van Dyke didn't
administer the wrong medication.

00:40.841 --> 00:43.008
I did.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074

00:59.159 --> 01:01.593
You're not up yet?

01:03.364 --> 01:06.231
Come on. You're gonna be late for work!

01:06.233 --> 01:08.066
Staff meeting? Patients to save?

01:08.068 --> 01:09.901
They're all saved. Come here.
Come back to bed.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.903
There's a foot of square surface
area left. Come on.

01:11.905 --> 01:14.573
I let them sleep inside
when daddy's not here.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.842
Hi.

01:16.844 --> 01:20.412
You know, I can't believe your
folks are gone for a whole week.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.914
Yeah. We get the place all to ourselves.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.183
- Mm-hmm.
- Just the four of us.

01:25.185 --> 01:26.385
Yeah.

01:26.387 --> 01:27.386
You really don't mind having them in bed?

01:27.388 --> 01:28.620
No, I get it.

01:28.622 --> 01:30.322
Patton had another nightmare, didn't you?

01:30.324 --> 01:32.691
Yeah, and Macarthur
followed loyally behind.

01:32.693 --> 01:34.226
You know how little brothers can be.

01:34.228 --> 01:35.394
Adorable.

01:35.396 --> 01:37.729
Mm-hmm. If only they
had a sister, you know?

01:37.731 --> 01:39.931
Someone to be protective of.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.667
Yeah, as long as she's not
too girly, though.

01:41.669 --> 01:43.802
Come on, 'cause the boys
like to play catch

01:43.804 --> 01:47.139
and watch scary movies.

01:47.141 --> 01:49.608
Yeah, but three does sound
like a nice number.

01:49.610 --> 01:55.080
Yeah. I've always wanted three.

01:55.082 --> 01:57.282
Are we still talking about dogs?

01:57.284 --> 01:59.584
It doesn't sound like it, does it?

02:05.626 --> 02:09.360
All right, we get it,
buddy. You're right.

02:09.363 --> 02:11.330
I like this "playing house" thing.

02:11.332 --> 02:14.966
Which reminds me... I made your
favorite sandwich for lunch,

02:14.968 --> 02:16.168
but you can only enjoy it

02:16.170 --> 02:17.803
if you get out of bed and go to work.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.604
- Wait a minute. You mean...?
- Peanut butter and banana.

02:19.606 --> 02:22.874
Peanut butter and banana. Yeah!

02:22.876 --> 02:24.943
Oh, my God.

02:24.945 --> 02:27.512
I love this "playing house"
thing. It's perf...

02:27.514 --> 02:29.281
No! Don't say it.

02:29.283 --> 02:31.116
Right. Don't want to jinx it.

02:31.118 --> 02:32.150
No.

02:36.155 --> 02:39.491
I'm sorry. Divya did what?

02:39.493 --> 02:40.992
She was working at Hamptons Heritage

02:40.994 --> 02:43.362
and she gave the wrong meds
to Eric Kassabian.

02:43.364 --> 02:44.863
Hold on a second.

02:44.865 --> 02:46.498
Since when does Divya
work at Hamptons Heritage?

02:46.500 --> 02:48.767
I don't know. We didn't discuss that.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.502
Why would she work there?

02:50.504 --> 02:52.504
Why would... why would she
work there and not tell us?

02:52.506 --> 02:54.239
I don't know and I don't know.

02:54.241 --> 02:55.540
We didn't discuss that either.

02:55.542 --> 02:58.810
Well, what... ? What did you discuss?

02:58.812 --> 03:02.214
She said she resigned from
the hospital after the incident.

03:02.216 --> 03:03.682
And then what did you say?

03:03.684 --> 03:06.151
- Nothing.
- What?

03:06.153 --> 03:08.220
Ev, we were in the middle
of celebrating your engagement.

03:08.222 --> 03:09.588
I didn't want to discuss it.

03:09.590 --> 03:12.224
Well, we'll discuss it right now.

03:12.226 --> 03:13.658
That's what staff meetings
are for, right?

03:13.660 --> 03:16.228
No. I don't want you harassing
her with questions.

03:16.230 --> 03:17.496
We know Divya.

03:17.498 --> 03:18.697
We know she feels bad enough
about what happened.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.499
She doesn't need to be tormented by you.

03:20.501 --> 03:21.767
I'm not gonna torment her.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.335
I'm just gonna get some
information, that's it.

03:23.337 --> 03:26.138
Just leave it alone.

03:26.140 --> 03:28.407
Wow, you must be really angry.

03:28.409 --> 03:30.108
- I'm not angry.
- Seriously?

03:30.110 --> 03:32.043
She was keeping a secret job from you

03:32.045 --> 03:34.279
and then she almost killed
a Hankmed patient.

03:34.281 --> 03:38.550
Hi, guys.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.318
You guys are talking about Divya.

03:40.320 --> 03:43.188
No, we're not.

03:43.190 --> 03:46.525
Okay, well, while we're
"not talking about it,"

03:46.527 --> 03:47.526
I just want to say...

03:47.528 --> 03:48.860
We're not talking about it

03:48.862 --> 03:50.228
because Divya should be here any minute.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.898
No, she'll be late.
She's on a clinic visit.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.666
What do you mean?

03:54.668 --> 03:56.535
I mean that I called about a patient

03:56.537 --> 03:58.804
and she said that she would
see him on her way in.

03:58.806 --> 04:00.205
Where?

04:00.207 --> 04:02.340
Hank, I'm sure this is
something that Divya can manage.

04:02.342 --> 04:03.942
Oh, yeah. I just want to see
if she needs a hand.

04:03.944 --> 04:05.310
Text me the address.

04:06.914 --> 04:10.382
He is so gonna tear the cape
off her Batman.

04:12.985 --> 04:15.587
It's an expression.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.789
Right.

04:57.097 --> 04:58.430
Hey.

04:58.432 --> 05:00.732
Hank, what are you doing here?

05:00.734 --> 05:02.868
Heard there was a patient. Who is it?

05:02.870 --> 05:06.338
I haven't met him yet. But
supposedly he's the lead singer.

05:06.340 --> 05:08.473
Really? That guy?

05:08.475 --> 05:10.575
He was complaining of leg weakness,

05:10.577 --> 05:14.079
but by the looks of things,
he's feeling all right now.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.390
Hey, Hank.

05:25.392 --> 05:27.225
I know that we haven't had a chance

05:27.227 --> 05:30.595
to talk about the mistake
I made with Mr. Kassabian.

05:30.597 --> 05:32.330
To be honest, I don't know how I missed

05:32.332 --> 05:33.532
that he was a diabetic on the chart.

05:33.534 --> 05:34.933
I've played that moment over...

05:34.935 --> 05:37.202
You were on your own time, not Hankmed's.

05:37.204 --> 05:39.504
The specifics are between you
and Hamptons Heritage,

05:39.506 --> 05:43.475
and it seems you've resolved it
with them so... matter resolved.

06:23.609 --> 06:26.609

06:29.850 --> 06:31.049
Is Jared going to be okay?

06:31.051 --> 06:32.217
It looks like a small cut.

06:32.219 --> 06:33.885
- Do you feel nauseous?
- No way.

06:33.887 --> 06:36.221
I'm 1,000%. Except
for the bleeding face thing.

06:36.223 --> 06:37.822
Well, what about your legs? The weakness?

06:37.824 --> 06:39.591
Yeah, that's pretty weird.

06:39.593 --> 06:41.426
But that slide was awesome, right?

06:41.428 --> 06:44.662
Calliope, will you go find out
if anybody got that on camera?

06:44.664 --> 06:46.965
All that showboating could
have gotten you seriously hurt.

06:46.967 --> 06:48.800
Move your elbow for me. Like this.

06:48.802 --> 06:51.870
It's called showmanship.
And it's what got us a producer.

06:51.872 --> 06:53.505
Last year at this time,

06:53.507 --> 06:55.340
we were living in a tiny place
in the city,

06:55.342 --> 06:57.642
playing rathole clubs for free drinks,

06:57.644 --> 07:00.111
and now we're staying
at this crazy mansion

07:00.113 --> 07:01.646
and we're recording our first album.

07:01.648 --> 07:03.047
We're gonna be rock stars.

07:03.049 --> 07:04.649
Yeah, but we've got to
finish the album first.

07:04.651 --> 07:08.620
Extend your knees for me, please.

07:08.622 --> 07:11.289
Good. Point your toes. Okay.

07:11.291 --> 07:13.525
I mean, my legs don't feel
broken or anything.

07:13.527 --> 07:14.859
Just the same as they
have for the last few days.

07:14.861 --> 07:16.427
Kinda weak and achy.

07:16.429 --> 07:18.863
Usually I can jump right up
from a slide, like a cat.

07:18.865 --> 07:20.565
Cats don't slide.

07:20.567 --> 07:23.768
It's a total crowd pleaser. My best move.

07:23.770 --> 07:25.904
And today, well, you saw it.

07:25.906 --> 07:27.806
Couldn't move my legs in time.

07:27.808 --> 07:29.374
What am I gonna do without my moves?

07:29.376 --> 07:30.775
You certainly didn't look
to be having any trouble

07:30.777 --> 07:33.144
before you flew off the stage.

07:33.146 --> 07:34.712
Well, the show must go on.

07:34.714 --> 07:37.849
The band must go on. The cat
slides we can do without.

07:37.851 --> 07:39.551
We're trying to get noticed by
the Silversun Pickups.

07:39.553 --> 07:40.685
Yeah, yeah.

07:40.687 --> 07:41.686
They're headlining the festival.

07:41.688 --> 07:42.887
Right.

07:42.889 --> 07:44.122
It looks like the only
injury from the fall

07:44.124 --> 07:45.356
is this cut on your eyebrow.

07:45.358 --> 07:46.491
Divya, would you grab the suture kit?

07:46.493 --> 07:47.725
What, you mean like,
from my eyebrow ring?

07:47.727 --> 07:49.561
Oh, man, it's gone.

07:49.563 --> 07:51.763
Yeah, it is. Come here.

07:51.765 --> 07:53.598
Why "Some Pig"?

07:53.600 --> 07:55.033
Jared and Todd picked the name

07:55.035 --> 07:56.501
before Calliope and I joined the band.

07:56.503 --> 07:58.469
It's from <i>Charlotte's Web.</i>

07:58.471 --> 08:00.605
You know, 'cause they're like
Charlotte and Wilbur.

08:00.607 --> 08:02.106
Best friends.

08:02.108 --> 08:04.809
Look, we can't keep dragging
out this video, all right?

08:04.811 --> 08:06.211
We've got to work on the album.

08:06.213 --> 08:07.512
We can do both.

08:07.514 --> 08:08.880
Remember, you guys,

08:08.882 --> 08:10.315
you may be coming from different angles,

08:10.317 --> 08:11.816
but you're both on the same side.

08:11.818 --> 08:14.085
Homer, not now with the buddhism, okay?

08:14.087 --> 08:16.020
All right, Jared, let's get
started on your stitch.

08:16.022 --> 08:18.256
Actually, why don't you
get a patient history.

08:18.258 --> 08:20.391
We need a detailed chart.
I'll do the stitch.

08:20.393 --> 08:22.727
Thanks.

08:27.633 --> 08:29.701
We'll get back to you
with the blood results

08:29.703 --> 08:31.102
as soon as we have them.

08:31.104 --> 08:34.239
In the meantime,
no stage slides, no dives,

08:34.241 --> 08:36.107
no rock star moves of any kind.

08:36.109 --> 08:37.342
I can't turn it off.

08:37.344 --> 08:40.544
How about turning it down?

08:40.547 --> 08:43.448
Oh, Hank, I've still got some questions

08:43.450 --> 08:44.682
on the medical history.

08:44.684 --> 08:46.184
Okay, why don't you finish that

08:46.186 --> 08:47.485
and I'll meet up with you
at the office later.

08:47.487 --> 08:48.453
Well, I could help you
with the patient load.

08:48.455 --> 08:50.655
Divide and conquer.

08:50.657 --> 08:54.225
Yeah. Let's stick together
on patient visits. For now.

09:05.337 --> 09:07.939
Ah, that's a grounder.

09:07.941 --> 09:10.008
It's about time you joined the
rest of the medical profession

09:10.010 --> 09:11.009
on the golf course.

09:11.011 --> 09:12.010
You know what?

09:12.012 --> 09:13.378
The truth of the matter is,

09:13.380 --> 09:14.445
I tried it a few times
and I just wasn't very good.

09:14.447 --> 09:15.880
Yeah, you're still not.

09:15.882 --> 09:16.881
Keep your left arm
straight on the back swing.

09:16.883 --> 09:18.182
Remember? Not to worry.

09:18.184 --> 09:19.384
I'm gonna have you shooting in the 70s

09:19.386 --> 09:20.752
by the end of the day.

09:20.754 --> 09:23.121
Of course, we'll have to stop
at the ninth hole.

09:23.123 --> 09:25.423
Ha ha ha. Keep my score low. I get it.

09:25.425 --> 09:26.758
You're a funny guy.

09:26.760 --> 09:28.259
I like to make learning fun.

09:32.231 --> 09:34.399
I think you killed a duck.

09:34.401 --> 09:36.067
It's good branching out from
just doctor/patient, you know?

09:36.069 --> 09:37.936
We can hang out without
my having to bill you.

09:37.938 --> 09:39.103
Actually, doc, I was gonna bill you.

09:39.105 --> 09:40.638
Oh, right.

09:40.640 --> 09:42.040
Come on. Now, that would
just be rude, wouldn't it?

09:42.042 --> 09:43.841
You did the second blood draw
free of charge.

09:43.843 --> 09:45.977
We'll have those results soon,

09:45.979 --> 09:47.512
but if you've been completely
symptom free,

09:47.514 --> 09:48.513
there should be nothing to worry about.

09:48.515 --> 09:49.747
I have.

09:49.749 --> 09:52.951
In fact, I've never had
a year like this one.

09:52.953 --> 09:54.652
I'm tearing up the tour, I'm traveling.

09:54.654 --> 09:56.521
I'm having the time of my life.

09:56.523 --> 09:58.256
That's great. So no fatigue?

09:58.258 --> 10:00.158
Nah. Maybe a little lately.

10:00.160 --> 10:01.526
But I'm playing more golf,

10:01.528 --> 10:02.560
making more cuts in the tournaments.

10:02.562 --> 10:04.929
What about stiffness? Sore muscles?

10:04.931 --> 10:07.231
- I'm playing more golf.
- How about weight loss?

10:07.233 --> 10:08.466
Oh, yeah. Thanks for noticing.

10:08.468 --> 10:10.702
Yeah, did I mention?
I'm playing more golf.

10:10.704 --> 10:12.036
Have you had any rashes?

10:12.038 --> 10:14.105
No. That a definite no.

10:14.107 --> 10:16.374
- Why do you ask?
- I'm just ruling things out.

10:16.376 --> 10:18.743
You're not billing me, doc.

10:18.745 --> 10:20.244
Let's see how this shot goes.

10:20.246 --> 10:21.679
I like my chances.

10:23.115 --> 10:24.716
Hey, now!

10:24.718 --> 10:26.317
That was pretty good.

10:53.612 --> 10:55.179
Everything okay?

10:55.181 --> 10:58.016
Uh, yeah, yeah. Never better.

10:58.018 --> 10:59.283
How are you?

10:59.285 --> 11:01.285
- Good.
- Cool. Good.

11:01.287 --> 11:02.887
All right.

11:14.900 --> 11:19.370
Hey, Henry! Wait up!

11:19.372 --> 11:21.639
Henry! Oh, God.

11:21.641 --> 11:22.807
Wait up!

11:22.809 --> 11:25.576
This is bad. This is really bad.

11:25.578 --> 11:27.912
This is so bad.

11:27.914 --> 11:29.447
You've had hives before.

11:29.449 --> 11:31.015
You know a steroid cream
clears them right up.

11:31.017 --> 11:33.284
I only get them when I'm
freaked out, Henry.

11:33.286 --> 11:34.886
Yeah, it's called a stress reaction.

11:34.888 --> 11:36.087
I know. Stress and panic, right?

11:36.089 --> 11:37.955
I had them my first summer camp.

11:37.957 --> 11:40.458
I had them when I had my CPA exam.

11:40.460 --> 11:41.726
Your third grade tap recital.

11:41.728 --> 11:43.961
Exactly. That number was terrifying.

11:43.963 --> 11:45.363
So what are you afraid of now?

11:45.365 --> 11:46.697
Nothing. That's my point.

11:46.699 --> 11:48.266
Nothing, except for the hives.

11:48.268 --> 11:49.534
I mean, I have hives on my body.

11:49.536 --> 11:51.102
And now the hives are
giving me more hives.

11:51.104 --> 11:53.905
There's just hives everywhere.

11:55.375 --> 11:57.809
You're worried this is a stress reaction

11:57.811 --> 11:59.110
to being engaged.

11:59.112 --> 12:01.412
No, I'm... that's... no, that's crazy.

12:01.414 --> 12:03.347
- Evan. Ev.
- Don't.

12:03.349 --> 12:05.349
That's off the table, all right?

12:05.351 --> 12:06.884
So what are we looking at?

12:06.886 --> 12:09.654
Do I have, like, smallpox
or scarlet fever or something?

12:09.656 --> 12:11.956
It's normal to feel nervous.

12:11.958 --> 12:13.491
Your life is changing.

12:13.493 --> 12:15.893
In a good way.

12:15.895 --> 12:17.595
I know.

12:17.597 --> 12:20.965
So how come my body doesn't know?

12:20.967 --> 12:23.201
Good luck, Ev. Gotta run.

12:24.603 --> 12:27.038
Stupid body.

12:35.447 --> 12:39.617
Yeah, okay. Be right there.

12:39.619 --> 12:43.387
Jared's blood work came back.
No infection or malnutrition.

12:43.389 --> 12:44.722
Divya.

12:44.724 --> 12:46.190
So based on his history and symptoms,

12:46.192 --> 12:47.925
I believe that he's suffering
from Guillain-Barre syndrome.

12:47.927 --> 12:49.460
Div.

12:49.462 --> 12:51.028
As you know, these symptoms
can increase in intensity

12:51.030 --> 12:53.498
until the patient is totally paralyzed.

12:53.500 --> 12:55.366
I think that we should
go see Jared right away.

12:55.368 --> 12:57.535
I agree we need to get over
there, but not for GBS.

12:57.537 --> 12:58.870
These symptoms line up, Hank.

12:58.872 --> 13:00.304
It's not GBS

13:00.306 --> 13:02.039
because GBS is not
environmental or contagious.

13:02.041 --> 13:04.008
Contagious?

13:04.010 --> 13:05.143
A second band member just called

13:05.145 --> 13:07.145
with the exact same symptoms.

13:17.786 --> 13:20.121
You're sleeping with her?

13:20.123 --> 13:22.189
We didn't mean for it
to happen. It just did.

13:22.191 --> 13:23.424
Don't be angry.

13:23.426 --> 13:24.258
I'm not angry at you, Calliope.

13:24.260 --> 13:25.860
Just your boyfriend.

13:25.862 --> 13:27.395
Okay, let's just focus
on the illness right now.

13:27.397 --> 13:29.530
Oh, well, whatever they have is an STD.

13:29.532 --> 13:30.865
Wha...?

13:30.867 --> 13:32.366
Even though we all signed an agreement

13:32.368 --> 13:34.668
not to sleep together because
it's unbelievably stupid

13:34.670 --> 13:36.203
and it ruins bands every time.

13:36.205 --> 13:37.605
Not every time.

13:37.607 --> 13:39.340
And it's not like either of us
are sleeping around.

13:39.342 --> 13:40.641
Definitely not.

13:40.643 --> 13:43.511
Calliope, can you describe your symptoms?

13:43.513 --> 13:45.045
Just like Jared's.

13:45.047 --> 13:47.415
My legs feel like they weigh
100 pounds each and they hurt.

13:47.417 --> 13:49.450
Okay, we don't know
this is sexually transmitted.

13:49.452 --> 13:51.185
Right now we just need to
do exams on both of you.

13:51.187 --> 13:52.987
Divya, would you take Calliope?

13:52.989 --> 13:55.623
Thank you.

13:58.059 --> 14:01.829
And Todd, I'm sorry.

14:03.932 --> 14:07.468
For breaking the pact.

14:07.470 --> 14:09.537
I am.

14:09.539 --> 14:12.306
Give me a break.

14:12.308 --> 14:14.275
Okay, guys,
I need to examine him privately.

14:14.277 --> 14:16.811
I told you, we've been sharing
one bedroom and one bathroom

14:16.813 --> 14:18.446
before we came here.

14:18.448 --> 14:19.880
And we've always been joined at the hip.

14:19.882 --> 14:21.382
Oh, not exactly.

14:21.384 --> 14:23.384
Sometimes you were
attached to Calliope's hip.

14:23.386 --> 14:27.388
Todd, you can't fault his heart.

14:27.390 --> 14:30.424
Look, we signed that pact for a reason.

14:30.426 --> 14:32.460
And you said, "no big deal, man".

14:32.462 --> 14:33.861
"We're gonna meet groupies everywhere."

14:33.863 --> 14:34.929
Remember?

14:34.931 --> 14:36.030
Okay, you can pull up your pants.

14:36.032 --> 14:37.364
You don't have any active lesions.

14:37.366 --> 14:38.666
Because I figured that was rock star.

14:38.668 --> 14:39.767
But I didn't like those other girls.

14:39.769 --> 14:40.901
I just like Calliope.

14:40.903 --> 14:43.237
Yeah, well, me too.

14:45.707 --> 14:47.241
Okay, I need to do another test.

14:47.243 --> 14:48.976
Jared, could you
take off your shirt, please?

14:48.978 --> 14:51.579
Oh, my... oh, my God. Oh, my God.

14:51.581 --> 14:53.814
That's why I could never find
you guys at the plant

14:53.816 --> 14:55.716
and why the ridiculous music video

14:55.718 --> 14:58.285
took twice as long
to shoot as it should have

14:58.287 --> 15:00.521
and why you're never around
to help Homer edit.

15:00.523 --> 15:01.755
Oh, you want to fight about that now?

15:01.757 --> 15:03.090
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

15:03.092 --> 15:04.725
I got the video covered, you guys.

15:04.727 --> 15:06.560
No way. You'll edit out all the gore.

15:06.562 --> 15:08.262
Why are we a band that needs gore?

15:08.264 --> 15:09.897
Okay, okay, I'm sorry, guys.

15:09.899 --> 15:12.032
I need everyone to clear
the room, please, right now.

15:12.034 --> 15:13.234
Why? These guys are my friends.

15:13.236 --> 15:15.069
I'm about to do a spinal tap.

15:15.071 --> 15:19.273
He needs to be surrounded
by calm and quiet, not friends.

15:19.275 --> 15:20.574
Please.

15:20.576 --> 15:23.878
A... a... a spinal tap?
That's serious, right?

15:23.880 --> 15:26.514
It's just a test. Lie down.

15:26.516 --> 15:28.449
It's called a
polymerase chain reaction test

15:28.451 --> 15:29.884
on his spinal fluid.

15:29.886 --> 15:31.185
Here, if you could hug that, please.

15:31.187 --> 15:32.586
Lie in the fetal position.

15:32.588 --> 15:34.321
It'll help us look
for STDs that are latent

15:34.323 --> 15:35.523
or inactive right now,

15:35.525 --> 15:36.957
but could still be causing his symptoms.

15:36.959 --> 15:39.727
Oh, so you're just looking
for proof that he's horny?

15:39.729 --> 15:41.128
I don't need to be worried about him?

15:41.130 --> 15:42.463
That's sweet, dude.

15:42.465 --> 15:44.698
Shut up.

15:47.903 --> 15:51.238
Just lay still, all right?

15:51.240 --> 15:54.241
He's gonna be digging
around in your spine.

15:56.244 --> 15:59.113
Neither of them had active lesions,

15:59.115 --> 16:00.581
but you're still thinking STDs?

16:00.583 --> 16:01.749
The PCR will tell us

16:01.751 --> 16:03.117
if they've had an STD or an infection

16:03.119 --> 16:04.485
in or around the brain,

16:04.487 --> 16:05.853
which could account for the leg weakness.

16:05.855 --> 16:07.254
We should get MRIs too.

16:07.256 --> 16:08.989
What makes you think that?

16:08.991 --> 16:10.457
Well, we could test

16:10.459 --> 16:12.726
for epidural abscesses or spinal tumors.

16:12.728 --> 16:14.295
Matching spinal tumors?

16:14.297 --> 16:16.764
Divya, you're throwing every
test you can think of

16:16.766 --> 16:18.365
at these patients because,
after what happened,

16:18.367 --> 16:19.867
you're afraid
you're gonna miss something.

16:19.869 --> 16:21.835
Let's just wait and
see the results of the PCR.

16:21.837 --> 16:27.474
Hank, I know I made a mistake.

16:27.476 --> 16:29.977
And I know people make mistakes.

16:29.979 --> 16:31.712
Then why are we still not talking?

16:31.714 --> 16:34.615
I think we've made progress
on the differential.

16:51.499 --> 16:54.234
- Whoa! Oh.
- Oh! Ah, sorry, Jack.

16:54.236 --> 16:57.204
Hey, no, Casey, I'm glad
I almost ran into you.

16:57.206 --> 16:59.740
- Unless that's hot.
- Oh, very.

16:59.742 --> 17:00.908
Then I'm glad for the near miss.

17:00.910 --> 17:03.711
Listen, I am looking for a game tomorrow.

17:03.713 --> 17:08.115
- Are you interested?
- Oh, uh, yeah, I don't know.

17:08.117 --> 17:10.517
I do have a lot of work on my desk.

17:10.519 --> 17:12.353
- But thank you.
- Okay.

17:12.355 --> 17:13.921
Yeah, you know,

17:13.923 --> 17:15.521
I'll probably have other
tee times at Shinnecock.

17:15.523 --> 17:17.590
- Shinnecock?
- You heard me.

17:17.593 --> 17:19.993
Yeah. I'd give my firstborn
for 18 at Shinnecock.

17:19.996 --> 17:22.596
I mean, I don't have
a firstborn, but if I did,

17:22.598 --> 17:25.132
- forget about it, I...
- Casey, in or out?

17:25.134 --> 17:30.371
- Uh... in.
- Yeah.

17:30.373 --> 17:33.741
Yeah. If we're clear.

17:33.743 --> 17:38.278
It's golf. Not a date, just golf.

17:38.280 --> 17:41.348
- Did I say date?
- No.

17:41.350 --> 17:43.484
I meant date,
but I cleverly didn't say it.

17:43.486 --> 17:45.853
I am moving to South America,

17:45.855 --> 17:48.389
so I'm just... I'm trying to stay focused.

17:48.391 --> 17:51.392
I like focus. Focus is good.
Focus is great.

17:51.394 --> 17:52.726
Focus bodes well for our golf game.

17:52.728 --> 17:54.895
Our "just golf game."

17:54.897 --> 17:56.697
All right.

17:56.699 --> 17:58.165
See you tomorrow.

17:58.167 --> 18:03.504
Uh, I'm sorry, Jack?
Uh, what's that on your neck?

18:03.506 --> 18:05.406
- Oh, ah.
- Yeah.

18:05.408 --> 18:07.374
Hazard of the trade. Sunburn.

18:07.376 --> 18:11.645
Don't be late, Casey.

18:11.647 --> 18:14.314
Serious sunburn.

18:28.930 --> 18:30.564
Honey, I'm home.

18:30.566 --> 18:32.700
How was your day, dear?

18:32.702 --> 18:35.969
Eventful. Apparently,
I went back to the '50s.

18:37.139 --> 18:38.906
I probably went a little overboard,

18:38.908 --> 18:41.408
but I wanted it to be authentic.

18:41.410 --> 18:42.843
Look.

18:42.845 --> 18:46.647
Yeah, I really... I really think
that I have enjoyed it.

18:46.649 --> 18:51.118
Good, good.

18:51.120 --> 18:52.553
Good, because, you know,

18:52.555 --> 18:54.521
some people would be getting
nervous right now,

18:54.523 --> 18:59.927
all our talk about the future
and everything, but not us.

18:59.929 --> 19:01.962
Is something wrong?

19:01.964 --> 19:03.597
I did go overboard, didn't I?

19:03.599 --> 19:06.500
No, uh, I... my shoulders
are sore. That's all it is.

19:06.502 --> 19:08.635
It was billing all day and
I was hunched over the computer

19:08.637 --> 19:10.704
and bringing home the bacon.

19:10.706 --> 19:11.905
Well, why don't I give you a massage?

19:11.907 --> 19:12.906
Why don't I take your shirt off?

19:12.908 --> 19:14.141
No, no, no.

19:14.143 --> 19:16.009
Um, come on, Paige, the '50s are over,

19:16.011 --> 19:18.278
as is the subjugation of women.

19:18.280 --> 19:21.048
You don't need to be
at your man's beck and call,

19:21.050 --> 19:23.450
so why don't I give you a massage?

19:23.452 --> 19:25.719
Deal.

19:25.721 --> 19:28.188
Not gonna pass that up.

19:28.190 --> 19:31.091
So why don't you just turn around?

19:31.093 --> 19:32.192
Okay.

19:32.194 --> 19:33.961
And, uh, get ready.

19:33.963 --> 19:36.430
Let me just warm up my hands.

19:36.432 --> 19:37.564
Okay.

19:37.566 --> 19:39.700
And there we go.

19:39.702 --> 19:42.136
Nice and deep.

19:42.138 --> 19:43.137
That's good.

19:43.139 --> 19:44.138
Oh.

19:44.140 --> 19:47.574
Mmm. So passionate.

20:01.823 --> 20:03.824
Is your belly sore?

20:03.826 --> 20:06.326
It's not bad.

20:06.328 --> 20:08.061
My stomach hurts like crazy.

20:08.063 --> 20:09.129
Hey, guys,

20:09.131 --> 20:13.100
- oh, hey, doc.
- Hey.

20:13.102 --> 20:15.002
Here you go.

20:15.004 --> 20:17.738
I'll be right back.

20:17.740 --> 20:19.907
- Hey, everything okay?
- No.

20:19.909 --> 20:22.442
They arrived saying that
their pain has gotten worse.

20:22.444 --> 20:23.911
They can barely walk,

20:23.913 --> 20:25.078
and now they have
urine retention as well.

20:25.080 --> 20:26.613
Bladder paralysis?

20:26.615 --> 20:28.749
We need to catheterize them
both to decrease the pressure.

20:28.751 --> 20:29.983
But they also need MRIs.

20:32.154 --> 20:35.989
And this time,
I'm not grasping at straws.

20:35.991 --> 20:37.257
I agree.

20:37.259 --> 20:40.761
Can you take care of the catheterization?

20:40.763 --> 20:42.763
I'll meet you at the hospital.

20:52.106 --> 20:53.507
Put some clothes on, Morty.

20:55.377 --> 20:58.212
Hey, did I miss an appointment?

20:58.214 --> 20:59.646
Uh, no. No.

20:59.648 --> 21:01.615
You haven't come to give me
more bad news?

21:01.617 --> 21:05.919
Oh, I'm pregnant, aren't I?

21:05.921 --> 21:08.856
Uh, no.

21:08.858 --> 21:10.257
I got your blood results back.

21:10.259 --> 21:11.792
Uh-huh.

21:11.794 --> 21:14.127
The anti-DNA test
came back positive for lupus.

21:14.129 --> 21:18.298
In your profession, positive
is a negative thing, right?

21:18.300 --> 21:20.067
What... what is lupus?

21:20.069 --> 21:21.134
It's an autoimmune disease

21:21.136 --> 21:23.303
that can affect your joints and organs.

21:23.305 --> 21:25.305
That's why I had the dupuytren's

21:25.307 --> 21:26.707
up until last summer?

21:26.709 --> 21:28.175
Uh, no, actually that's unrelated,

21:28.177 --> 21:30.277
but it's probably been causing
the stiffness and fatigue

21:30.279 --> 21:31.912
that you've been attributing
to your golf game.

21:31.914 --> 21:38.051
Well, okay. So are you gonna fix it?

21:38.053 --> 21:39.686
There's no cure.

21:39.688 --> 21:41.622
Pardon me?

21:41.624 --> 21:44.324
Lupus is a chronic disease,
but it's manageable.

21:44.326 --> 21:47.127
Okay, but, I mean,

21:47.129 --> 21:50.130
I'm not gonna have to quit
the tour, though, am I, doc?

21:50.132 --> 21:53.100
Come on, doc, I just
got back in the game.

21:53.102 --> 21:55.602
Yeah, no, I know.
And no, you're not out yet.

21:55.604 --> 21:57.604
Many people with lupus live active lives.

21:57.606 --> 21:59.673
We'll talk about
a long-term treatment plan,

21:59.675 --> 22:02.075
but first we have to learn more
about your progression.

22:02.077 --> 22:03.577
Progression?

22:03.579 --> 22:05.112
Sound like I've progressed to
the end of my good luck streak.

22:05.114 --> 22:08.015
Not necessarily. Jack,
we can fight this together.

22:08.017 --> 22:10.284
Okay, well,
we'll fight it together later.

22:10.286 --> 22:12.319
I've got a lesson.

22:36.275 --> 22:37.608
There's inflammation

22:37.610 --> 22:39.643
across the width of the spinal
cord in both patients,

22:39.645 --> 22:41.278
but I find no structural lesions

22:41.280 --> 22:42.446
to account for the swelling.

22:42.448 --> 22:43.948
Transverse myelitis?

22:43.950 --> 22:45.216
Well, TM could be secondary

22:45.218 --> 22:46.951
to several infections and diseases.

22:46.953 --> 22:49.086
STDs are still a possibility.

22:49.088 --> 22:50.154
Right.

22:50.156 --> 22:51.889
Follow up with the lab about the PCR.

22:51.891 --> 22:53.891
I'll have the hospital start
them on steroids

22:53.893 --> 22:55.226
to treat the inflammation,

22:55.228 --> 23:00.164
but we've got to find
the underlying cause soon.

23:00.166 --> 23:03.601
Oh, by the way, Divya.
I heard what happened.

23:03.603 --> 23:05.369
Don't beat yourself up too much about it.

23:05.371 --> 23:07.905
You are still great at what you do.

23:21.253 --> 23:23.120
Where'd you go? Paige?

23:23.122 --> 23:26.323
In here. Come look what I found.

23:26.325 --> 23:28.926
This is so disgusting!

23:28.928 --> 23:31.495
What...?

23:31.497 --> 23:33.631
What did you guys do?

23:35.268 --> 23:39.870
Evan, look.

23:39.872 --> 23:41.639
It's bedbugs, isn't it?

23:44.276 --> 23:47.912
They've invaded New York and
now they're here. In my bed.

23:47.914 --> 23:50.581
Well, this does look like a bite,

23:50.583 --> 23:53.717
but bedbugs usually bite
in lines or clusters.

23:53.719 --> 23:55.452
This looks more like a conenose.

23:55.454 --> 23:57.521
That does not sound less gross.

23:57.523 --> 23:59.790
Oh, uh, well sometimes
they're called kissing bugs

23:59.792 --> 24:01.892
'cause they bite the skin
exposed while you're sleeping.

24:01.894 --> 24:03.093
Usually your face.

24:03.095 --> 24:06.497
Oh. Okay. How did we get bugs in our bed?

24:06.499 --> 24:08.232
Uh, well, they live in wooded areas.

24:08.234 --> 24:10.234
Sometimes animals can bring them inside.

24:10.236 --> 24:11.635
I don't know.

24:11.637 --> 24:14.338
Patton and Macarthur.
They've been sleeping with us.

24:14.340 --> 24:17.474
Our boys have bugs?

24:17.476 --> 24:20.544
Your hives are probably an
allergic reaction to the bites.

24:20.546 --> 24:23.247
Hives? Since when do you have hives?

24:23.249 --> 24:27.618
Wait. You didn't... ? Uh, sorry, dude.

24:27.620 --> 24:29.286
Did you hear that, honey? Kissing bugs.

24:29.288 --> 24:32.456
Even our bugs are romantic. Isn't that...?

24:47.272 --> 24:50.474
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:50.476 --> 24:55.179
Did they move the first tee?

24:55.181 --> 24:56.847
We had a game today, Jack.

24:56.849 --> 24:59.350
I forgot, Casey. I'm sorry.

24:59.352 --> 25:01.619
He forgot.

25:01.621 --> 25:03.854
Hey, you know, if you needed to cancel,

25:03.856 --> 25:07.858
you could have emailed, texted, uh,

25:07.860 --> 25:09.193
I don't know, sent a carrier pigeon?

25:09.195 --> 25:11.829
Next time, carrier pigeon.

25:13.498 --> 25:15.966
Everything okay?

25:15.968 --> 25:22.039
Well, um, I'm out of luck.

25:22.041 --> 25:25.709
I thought I bought
a little extra last summer,

25:25.711 --> 25:28.045
but now that's all gone.

25:28.047 --> 25:32.850
I should have known things
were going too well.

25:32.852 --> 25:35.219
Let me get this straight.

25:35.221 --> 25:36.987
You're missing our game

25:36.989 --> 25:38.889
so you can still here and feel
sorry for yourself?

25:38.891 --> 25:42.126
Look, you don't understand.

25:42.128 --> 25:48.666
I... you know, like, this year
has been amazing, all right?

25:48.668 --> 25:50.234
Three top ten finishes.

25:50.236 --> 25:52.569
I've qualified for next year's U.S. Open.

25:52.571 --> 25:54.505
Peter Kostis even
said I had a great swing.

25:54.507 --> 25:56.840
But now, now I've got...

26:02.647 --> 26:05.949
I've got to fight things.

26:05.951 --> 26:07.084
So fight.

26:07.086 --> 26:08.419
It's not that simple.

26:08.421 --> 26:12.623
It never is.

26:14.293 --> 26:18.062
Look, so the other shoe
dropped. That's life.

26:18.064 --> 26:19.663
There's always gonna be another shoe.

26:19.665 --> 26:23.901
And you can waste a lot of time
worrying about it

26:23.903 --> 26:28.272
while life just passes you by.

26:28.274 --> 26:30.441
Who are we talking about now?

26:30.443 --> 26:34.478
I'm just saying that not everyone

26:34.480 --> 26:39.650
gets to live their dream,
not even for a short time.

26:39.652 --> 26:41.118
And for that matter,

26:41.120 --> 26:43.587
not everybody gets
a tee time at Shinnecock.

26:43.589 --> 26:50.594
So, Mr. Jack O'Malley,
are you in or are you out?

26:50.596 --> 26:52.796
- I'm in.
- That's what I thought.

26:52.798 --> 26:54.064
Let's go.

26:54.066 --> 26:55.766
You know, I like you, Casey.

26:55.768 --> 26:58.302
See how you feel when I'm
done wiping the course with you.

27:15.353 --> 27:19.356
- Hey, Todd.
- Hey.

27:19.358 --> 27:22.259
Have you been here all night?

27:22.261 --> 27:26.063
What can I say? The guy's my best friend.

27:26.065 --> 27:27.297
If you don't mind me saying,

27:27.299 --> 27:28.899
you don't seem to agree on very much.

27:28.901 --> 27:31.335
Uh, well, we've been like that
since high school

27:31.337 --> 27:34.238
when it was just the two of us
playing music in my garage.

27:34.240 --> 27:38.075
One day Jared says, "we should
do this as our job."

27:38.077 --> 27:40.244
Like it was that easy.

27:40.246 --> 27:42.713
What about Calliope?

27:42.715 --> 27:46.350
She's great, isn't she? So's Jared.

27:46.352 --> 27:50.320
I mean, I'd hate him
if I didn't love him so much.

27:50.322 --> 27:51.989
She deserves someone like him.

27:55.660 --> 27:57.594
How are they feeling?

27:57.596 --> 27:59.596
Better.

27:59.598 --> 28:03.100
The steroid is decreasing
the inflammation

28:03.102 --> 28:06.403
until we can discover
and treat the underlying cause.

28:06.405 --> 28:10.007
Which could be something serious, right?

28:10.009 --> 28:11.942
Worse than an STD?

28:11.944 --> 28:13.777
I mean, if they're almost paralyzed...

28:13.779 --> 28:15.579
It could be a number of things.

28:15.581 --> 28:18.515
We'll know more soon.

28:18.517 --> 28:22.252
Okay, thanks.

28:22.254 --> 28:23.387
You guys need anything?

28:23.389 --> 28:26.723
I'm gonna hit the vending machines.

28:26.725 --> 28:29.827
Ow! Aah!

28:29.829 --> 28:31.695
Ah, my legs!

28:31.697 --> 28:33.530
Ow!

28:33.532 --> 28:35.532
I can't stand up.

28:50.494 --> 28:52.327
We got Todd's MRI results back.

28:52.329 --> 28:54.963
His spinal cord is also inflamed.

28:54.965 --> 28:56.998
So we have got three band members

28:57.000 --> 28:58.834
with transverse myelitis.

28:58.836 --> 29:00.335
Back to square one.

29:01.738 --> 29:03.705
No, the third patient rules out
STDs. That's progress.

29:04.708 --> 29:05.707
Yes.

29:05.709 --> 29:07.008
Homer?

29:09.512 --> 29:11.546
But we can't find the fourth patient.

29:11.548 --> 29:13.381
Possible fourth patient.

29:13.383 --> 29:14.883
Homer!

29:14.885 --> 29:16.151
I'm gonna try around back.

29:16.153 --> 29:18.053
Well, I guess I will too.

29:20.790 --> 29:22.491
- Homer?
- Homer?

29:22.493 --> 29:23.658
Homer!

29:27.296 --> 29:28.630
Homer!

29:29.632 --> 29:31.099
Homer!

29:31.101 --> 29:34.536
Aloha!

29:34.538 --> 29:36.538
Sorry. Sorry about... sorry about that.

29:36.540 --> 29:40.842
I, um, I'm just trying to
jumpstart the creative process.

29:40.844 --> 29:42.444
How are Jared and Calliope?

29:42.446 --> 29:43.678
They're fine. How are you feeling?

29:43.680 --> 29:46.348
Mind and spirit are one. Why do you ask?

29:46.350 --> 29:48.150
Todd is now presenting with the symptoms.

29:48.152 --> 29:49.885
But we don't want to jump to conclusions.

29:49.887 --> 29:52.721
Have you had any pain or
weakness in your extremities?

29:52.723 --> 29:54.689
Not at all.

29:54.691 --> 29:56.291
Can you tell us about anything
you've done differently

29:56.293 --> 29:58.026
from your bandmates
in the last few weeks?

29:58.028 --> 29:59.961
We pretty much go everywhere together.

29:59.963 --> 30:03.598
Here, the van, the gigs. But I'm a vegan.

30:03.600 --> 30:08.436
Never done drugs.
Oh, and I repeat a mantra.

30:08.438 --> 30:11.006
I think those guys could
really use that, actually.

30:11.008 --> 30:12.307
Ah, I'm not sure it'll help

30:12.309 --> 30:13.675
with transverse myelitis, unfortunately.

30:13.677 --> 30:16.578
Other than that,
it's been all about the video.

30:25.322 --> 30:28.924
A field. Maybe ticks? Lyme disease?

30:28.926 --> 30:30.625
Three different infected ticks?

30:30.627 --> 30:33.395
Oh, there was one place I wouldn't go.

30:33.397 --> 30:36.031
Where was that?

30:36.033 --> 30:37.499
A processing plant.

30:43.340 --> 30:46.074
That place goes against
everything I stand for.

30:46.076 --> 30:47.742
What kind of processing plant?

30:47.744 --> 30:51.813
Pork. Jared can kind of get
literal about our band name.

30:51.815 --> 30:54.282
Well, did they eat any pork?
As part of the video?

30:54.284 --> 30:55.951
No clue.

30:55.953 --> 30:57.886
You know, it could be some
odd form of trichinosis.

30:57.888 --> 31:00.222
I'll get muscle biopsies right away.

31:00.224 --> 31:02.624
Uh, Divya. Divya, hey.

31:02.626 --> 31:03.992
I know you want to save the day here,

31:03.994 --> 31:05.627
but racing toward an unlikely diagnosis

31:05.629 --> 31:06.628
won't erase your mistake.

31:06.630 --> 31:08.096
It'll just lead to more.

31:08.098 --> 31:13.168
You think I'm trying to vindicate myself?

31:13.170 --> 31:15.370
Which isn't easy with you
over my shoulder,

31:15.372 --> 31:16.871
second-guessing my every instinct.

31:16.873 --> 31:18.306
Yeah, because you're off-balance.

31:18.308 --> 31:19.975
You're not thinking things through.

31:19.977 --> 31:22.944
Then just fire me.
Fire me and get it over with.

31:22.946 --> 31:24.980
But stop treating me
like just another employee.

31:24.982 --> 31:26.615
When you stop treating me

31:26.617 --> 31:28.183
like a disapproving parent
you have to hide things from.

31:28.185 --> 31:30.785
I hid moonlighting
at Hamptons Heritage from you

31:30.787 --> 31:32.988
because it is my financial mess.

31:32.990 --> 31:34.623
I had to clean it up myself.

31:34.625 --> 31:36.458
I didn't need you swooping in to fix it.

31:36.460 --> 31:38.760
So rather than depend
on anyone, you took a job

31:38.762 --> 31:40.528
and started burning
the candle at both ends?

31:40.530 --> 31:42.130
See? You wouldn't have approved.

31:42.132 --> 31:43.365
I would have also probably tried to help,

31:43.367 --> 31:44.866
so I guess it's all my fault.

31:44.868 --> 31:46.501
Sounds like she didn't
want to disappoint you.

31:46.503 --> 31:48.970
And he's hurt because
you didn't trust him.

31:48.972 --> 31:50.905
You guys must be really good friends.

31:56.145 --> 31:58.113
Wait a second.

31:58.115 --> 32:00.582
Are those workers
behind the band or extras?

32:00.584 --> 32:02.183
Oh, like we could afford extras.

32:02.185 --> 32:04.886
We couldn't even afford to shut
down the plant while we shot.

32:04.888 --> 32:09.024
They're wearing masks,
but... but your friends aren't.

32:09.026 --> 32:11.192
Yeah. They made the band sign waivers.

32:11.194 --> 32:13.361
Jared was going for a look.

32:13.363 --> 32:15.697
What... what's that machine with the hoses?

32:15.699 --> 32:18.500
Oh, it's an air compressor.

32:18.502 --> 32:19.934
What is it used for?

32:19.936 --> 32:22.904
Blowing out the brains. Barbaric, right?

32:22.906 --> 32:25.907
I guess some people eat them with eggs.

32:25.909 --> 32:27.309
I'm gonna cut this part.

32:27.311 --> 32:30.912
So brains from the animals were airborne.

32:30.914 --> 32:33.148
The band could have breathed it in.

32:33.150 --> 32:35.116
Pig DNA is close to human.

32:35.118 --> 32:37.319
Valve transplants happen every day.

32:37.321 --> 32:40.155
Yeah, but if the animal myelin
were misread by the body...

32:40.157 --> 32:42.924
Then it would be like graft versus host.

32:42.926 --> 32:46.828
Immune mimicry, causing
spinal cord inflammation,

32:46.830 --> 32:48.396
heavy legs, bladder paralysis.

32:48.398 --> 32:50.198
This is a simple autoimmune response?

32:50.200 --> 32:51.266
Oh, it's anything but simple.

32:51.268 --> 32:55.170
I agree. I don't get it.

33:01.877 --> 33:04.746
So your immune system
is designed to defend

33:04.748 --> 33:06.815
against germs, viruses,
that kind of thing,

33:06.817 --> 33:07.949
but if something gets inside

33:07.951 --> 33:09.551
that looks like your own tissue...

33:09.553 --> 33:11.986
In this case,
the nerve tissue of the pigs...

33:11.988 --> 33:13.521
your body can't tell the difference

33:13.523 --> 33:15.623
and starts attacking
everything around it too.

33:15.625 --> 33:18.259
Your own nerve tissue becomes
collateral damage.

33:18.261 --> 33:20.161
But if we all breathed it together,

33:20.163 --> 33:21.663
why did Jared get sick first?

33:21.665 --> 33:23.331
Different bodies,
different immune systems.

33:23.333 --> 33:24.599
They react in their own time.

33:24.601 --> 33:26.134
Can you stop it?

33:26.136 --> 33:27.635
You'll all need to take a blood product

33:27.637 --> 33:28.903
that contains antibodies.

33:28.905 --> 33:30.872
It'll neutralize the foreign substance.

33:30.874 --> 33:32.707
You'll also need to continue
with the steroids

33:32.709 --> 33:37.145
for a bit as well, but you'll be fine.

33:37.147 --> 33:40.949
Okay, I can't believe we have
aerosolized pig brains.

33:44.221 --> 33:46.020
How did you guys come up with this?

33:46.022 --> 33:48.823
It was all thanks to Homer.

33:48.825 --> 33:51.292
Hey, Homer.

33:51.294 --> 33:53.027
Nice.

33:59.068 --> 34:00.769
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:00.771 --> 34:02.737
What the... ? A bow? No.

34:02.739 --> 34:04.873
Bows on Patton and Macarthur?

34:04.875 --> 34:06.608
- Until I get my girl.
- No, come on.

34:06.610 --> 34:07.909
The other dogs at the park
are gonna make fun of them.

34:07.911 --> 34:09.444
Hey, hey, don't... don't touch.

34:09.446 --> 34:12.112
Sorry, boys. Sorry for
the emasculation. Come on.

34:12.114 --> 34:13.681
Okay, so the dogs are covered.

34:13.683 --> 34:16.751
Did you wash the pillows
and sheets in extra hot water?

34:16.753 --> 34:17.918
Three times.

34:17.920 --> 34:19.087
I took everything in that room

34:19.089 --> 34:20.155
and put it in a plastic bag outside

34:20.157 --> 34:20.922
so the little bastards will fry.

34:20.924 --> 34:22.290
Good.

34:22.292 --> 34:24.159
Get in. Get in there.
Get in there. Good boys.

34:24.161 --> 34:26.860
See, I've proven that
I am in no way freaked out

34:26.862 --> 34:30.231
or intimidated by or
even moderately uncomfortable

34:30.233 --> 34:32.033
with our upcoming nuptials.

34:32.034 --> 34:34.268
Okay, well, it would be
all right if you were.

34:34.271 --> 34:35.837
But I'm not. I'm not at all.

34:35.839 --> 34:37.038
It was the bugs. It was the kissing bugs.

34:37.040 --> 34:38.540
Hey, this ought to cheer you guys up.

34:38.542 --> 34:41.543
It was the not remotely romantic
despite their name bugs.

34:41.545 --> 34:43.678
Hurry!

34:49.185 --> 34:52.053
Aah!

34:52.054 --> 34:53.321
Here we go.

34:53.322 --> 34:54.989
Oh, I'm just saying it's not uncommon

34:54.991 --> 34:56.491
for people to be nervous.

34:56.493 --> 34:58.493
I mean, an engagement is a big thing.

34:58.495 --> 35:01.796
It is, I know. Just not for us.

35:01.798 --> 35:04.699
No, no. Not... not us.

35:04.701 --> 35:07.302
We're... we're... we're so comfortable.

35:11.173 --> 35:13.007
Are you freaked out?

35:13.009 --> 35:16.478
Maybe just a little bit.
Please don't be upset.

35:16.480 --> 35:20.949
I think maybe that's why I went
so overboard playing house.

35:20.951 --> 35:22.517
I was trying to convince myself

35:22.519 --> 35:24.352
that there's nothing to be scared of.

35:24.354 --> 35:26.354
- Like immersion therapy.
- Right.

35:26.356 --> 35:27.856
And it's not because I don't love you

35:27.858 --> 35:30.058
and it's not because I don't
want to marry you,

35:30.060 --> 35:34.796
it's just, I've never thought
about my future before.

35:34.798 --> 35:36.865
You know, it's always
six months at a time

35:36.867 --> 35:39.467
and always taking care of my mom

35:39.469 --> 35:41.836
or being there for my dad.

35:41.838 --> 35:45.607
I just never thought about forever.

35:45.609 --> 35:49.244
The "F" word.

35:49.246 --> 35:50.778
Yeah.

35:50.780 --> 35:52.847
I get it.

35:52.849 --> 35:56.217
I mean, you can tell me things like that.

35:56.219 --> 35:59.888
That's what I'm here for...
to comfort you,

35:59.890 --> 36:02.257
make you feel better when you're nervous.

36:02.259 --> 36:05.326
Wow. You're good.

36:06.730 --> 36:09.030
My nervousness is almost gone.

36:09.032 --> 36:11.266
Almost?

36:15.104 --> 36:16.838
Totally gone.

36:16.840 --> 36:18.840
Get in.

36:23.445 --> 36:25.713
And remember this conversation, okay?

36:25.715 --> 36:27.482
For when I get the jitters
the night before the wedding.

36:27.484 --> 36:30.084
Well, apparently, I'm gonna
be able to tell right away.

36:30.086 --> 36:31.853
I'm gonna see it all over your body.

36:31.855 --> 36:35.690
It is so cute that you get hives
when you're scared.

36:35.692 --> 36:38.960
I love it.

36:38.962 --> 36:41.195
Oh, God. Stupid body.

36:50.773 --> 36:52.941
- Hey, Jack.
- Hey, Hank.

36:52.943 --> 36:55.843
I, uh, well, you said you wanted to see

36:55.845 --> 36:57.345
where I am with this lupus thing, right?

36:57.347 --> 36:58.846
I did. I'm just glad you heard.

36:58.848 --> 37:00.348
Divya taking good care of you?

37:00.350 --> 37:01.749
Yeah, yeah.

37:01.751 --> 37:03.184
She asked me everything
about my medical history

37:03.186 --> 37:04.586
dating back to my first pediatrician.

37:04.588 --> 37:06.955
Then she leeched me
and had me pee in a cup.

37:06.957 --> 37:08.423
Yeah?

37:08.425 --> 37:10.592
I know that you did a
urinalysis during the physical,

37:10.594 --> 37:12.360
but I checked the chart carefully,

37:12.362 --> 37:13.928
and I noticed a variation,

37:13.930 --> 37:16.164
so I thought I'd take
a second sample to be safe.

37:16.166 --> 37:18.032
Well, it was a morning test,
so the minor...

37:18.034 --> 37:19.100
You know what?

37:19.102 --> 37:22.904
You had an instinct, and I trust it.

37:22.906 --> 37:24.439
Hey, I'm glad you stopped by.

37:24.441 --> 37:25.974
I was gonna visit you later today.

37:25.976 --> 37:28.443
Aw, doc, not more bad news.
I can't take it.

37:28.445 --> 37:29.644
No, no, no, no.

37:29.646 --> 37:31.646
I was gonna tell you,
I found out Tim Raines,

37:31.648 --> 37:34.215
seven-time all-star, three time
World Series champ,

37:34.217 --> 37:36.851
he kept playing baseball after
he was diagnosed with lupus.

37:36.853 --> 37:39.887
I will keep playing, doc,
as long as I can.

37:39.889 --> 37:43.124
And I will always be grateful
for the best time of my life,

37:43.126 --> 37:44.559
no matter how many shoes there are.

37:44.561 --> 37:47.261
- Huh?
- That's a... we... never mind.

37:47.263 --> 37:48.730
Anyway, you know what?
I did some reading.

37:48.732 --> 37:51.332
This lupus thing is not so bad.

37:51.334 --> 37:53.101
Yeah, and it could take years to develop.

37:53.103 --> 37:55.036
Yeah, so I'm lucky I have you
along for the ride.

37:55.038 --> 37:56.838
I'm lucky you give free golf lessons.

37:56.840 --> 37:58.640
Yeah. See ya.

38:02.478 --> 38:03.745
- See ya.
- See ya.

38:03.747 --> 38:04.912
Yeah.

38:07.816 --> 38:10.618
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye. Okay.

38:15.291 --> 38:20.628
Homer was right. I was hurt.

38:20.630 --> 38:24.699
I didn't know it, but I was.

38:24.701 --> 38:26.067
And just so you know,

38:26.069 --> 38:29.570
I still think you are
the best at what you do.

38:29.572 --> 38:33.741
Thanks, Hank.

38:33.743 --> 38:35.043
What's the matter?

38:35.045 --> 38:38.713
It is only a semi-quantitative test.

38:38.715 --> 38:41.382
- I mean, we really need to...
- Divya, what is it?

38:41.384 --> 38:43.785
Jack's proteins are plus three.

38:43.787 --> 38:48.423
It wasn't a minor variation
on the original test.

38:48.425 --> 38:50.725
His lupus is more
advanced than we thought.

38:50.727 --> 38:52.694
It's attacking his kidneys.

38:58.161 --> 39:01.430
All right, so just so I understand,

39:01.432 --> 39:02.598
how long did you work there for?

39:02.600 --> 39:04.967
- A few weeks.
- A few weeks?

39:04.969 --> 39:06.335
And then you just, like,

39:06.337 --> 39:07.402
fell asleep on the job or something?

39:07.404 --> 39:09.071
- Evan.
- Sorry.

39:09.073 --> 39:11.206
But you discussed everything
with Hank, right?

39:11.208 --> 39:12.674
You guys, like, made up and everything?

39:12.676 --> 39:14.276
- Yes.
- All right.

39:14.278 --> 39:16.378
Please tell me that this
interrogation is nearly over.

39:16.380 --> 39:19.548
It's over. It is. One more question.

39:21.985 --> 39:23.619
Are you still worried about money?

39:23.621 --> 39:29.424
Divya! Nice shirt. Thanks for coming.

39:29.426 --> 39:31.627
Oh, you're welcome.
I wouldn't have missed it.

39:31.629 --> 39:34.229
Hey, I'm Evan R. Lawson,
the CFO of Hankmed, okay.

39:34.231 --> 39:35.664
Nice to meet you.

39:35.666 --> 39:36.832
Um, hey, listen, uh, come backstage.

39:36.834 --> 39:38.033
- Everybody's back there.
- All right, cool.

39:38.035 --> 39:39.635
- Just come...
- Excuse us. This way?

39:39.637 --> 39:43.505
- Yeah, keep going.
- I'm a CFO. Please. Thank you.

39:43.507 --> 39:45.440
Guys, guys, Divya's here.

39:45.442 --> 39:46.508
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:46.510 --> 39:48.076
- And this is Evan.
- Look at you.

39:48.078 --> 39:50.779
Hey, man, Evan.

39:50.781 --> 39:51.747
Calliope, Jared. Evan.

39:51.749 --> 39:53.181
Hey, man. What's up?

39:53.183 --> 39:55.651
I take it that the intravenous
immunoglobulin is working

39:55.653 --> 39:58.220
and decreasing the autoimmune
response of the pig myelin.

39:58.222 --> 40:00.756
I have no idea what that
means, but I feel awesome.

40:00.758 --> 40:02.324
Me too. 1,000%.

40:02.326 --> 40:04.493
Whoa.

40:04.495 --> 40:05.961
That means that it is working.

40:05.963 --> 40:07.763
Not only that,
but now we're in the running

40:07.765 --> 40:09.965
to open for the Silversun
Pickups on their tour this fall.

40:09.967 --> 40:11.700
Are you kidding me? Dude, I love them.

40:11.702 --> 40:13.035
- That's... congratulations.
- Thank you.

40:13.037 --> 40:14.202
They must have really enjoyed the album.

40:14.204 --> 40:15.470
We still haven't finished it.

40:15.472 --> 40:17.005
The music video?

40:17.007 --> 40:18.473
Nope. Uh, that's actually
not done, either.

40:18.475 --> 40:22.577
Okay, so how did the Silversun
Pickups come to love Some Pig?

40:22.579 --> 40:23.912
You tell her.

40:23.914 --> 40:26.915
Uh, well the video of Jared
sliding off the stage

40:26.917 --> 40:29.885
went viral, and so they saw some of it

40:29.887 --> 40:31.286
and actually managed to catch
some of the music.

40:31.288 --> 40:33.588
And now they're here
to listen to us play.

40:33.590 --> 40:34.856
Operative word there, listen.

40:34.858 --> 40:37.025
- Yeah.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

40:37.027 --> 40:38.527
They're here to hear the music, okay?

40:38.529 --> 40:40.062
Not the jumping, sliding nonsense.

40:40.064 --> 40:41.263
Dude, they're here for the show.

40:41.265 --> 40:42.998
Yeah, I know, but the show is the music.

40:43.000 --> 40:47.369
Okay, guys, guys. Same side, remember?

40:47.371 --> 40:50.372
Right. Okay. Oh, hey, check it out.

40:52.476 --> 40:54.843
That's our cue.

40:54.845 --> 40:57.212
We got this.

41:02.553 --> 41:03.652
Yeah!

41:29.546 --> 41:36.051
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
Oh, Whoo! That's great.

41:36.053 --> 41:38.487
Good job.
