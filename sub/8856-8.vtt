00:40.208 --> 00:42.167
THAT'S IT, JIMMY.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
NOW DISTRIBUTE YOUR WEIGHT.

00:44.083 --> 00:45.833
YOU CAN DO IT. BALANCE.

00:45.917 --> 00:47.083
THAT TICKLES.

00:47.167 --> 00:49.125
YES, AND NOW
TRY STANDING.

01:16.208 --> 01:19.375
CHECK OUT THESE MOVES,
JIMMY BOY.

01:21.458 --> 01:23.000
AH!

01:24.042 --> 01:26.208

01:48.792 --> 01:51.167
WHAT'S THAT, PLANK?

01:52.042 --> 01:53.292
YOU WANT TO SURF, TOO?

01:53.375 --> 01:56.125
WHY, YOU'D SWELL UP
BIGGER THAN A BREAD BOX.

01:56.208 --> 02:00.083
WELL, STEP RIGHT UP

I GET THROUGH--

02:06.625 --> 02:10.875

119 TIMES IN A ROW.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.542
PHEW! I CHUCKED
BISCUITS AFTER THAT,
DIDN'T I, BUDDY?

02:19.625 --> 02:23.542
WHY, PLANK SPENT
HIS WHOLE ALLOWANCE
THAT DAY--

02:23.625 --> 02:25.583
A REGULAR
ROCKEFELLER.

02:25.667 --> 02:27.542
PLANK GETS AN ALLOWANCE?

02:27.625 --> 02:30.458
HAVE I GOT A RIDE FOR YOU!

PLANK?

02:35.792 --> 02:37.042
NICE RIDE, HUH, PLANK?

02:37.125 --> 02:38.125
THAT'LL BE 25 CENTS.

02:38.208 --> 02:42.167
Jimmy: PLANK SAYS YOU THROW
LIKE A TOOTHPICK, EDDY.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.208
HE WON'T PAY
FOR KIDDIE RIDES.

02:44.042 --> 02:45.375
WELL, YOU
TELL THAT DOORSTOP

02:45.458 --> 02:47.917
EDDY'S GOT A RIDE THAT
WILL ROUND HIS CORNERS,

CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP.

PLANK SAYS
YOUR MOUTH RUNS FASTER

02:53.125 --> 02:56.042

CHEESE, EDDY.

02:56.750 --> 02:58.167
I'LL TAKE THAT
AS A "YES."

02:58.000 --> 03:01.083
I OBJECT. MY SKIN
IS STILL PRUNED

03:01.167 --> 03:03.375

SURF-SCHOOL FIASCO.

03:03.458 --> 03:06.125

OF A LIFETIME?

03:08.125 --> 03:09.125
LET'S GET TO WORK.

03:09.208 --> 03:11.708
WHO SAYS MONEY
CAN'T BUY HAPPINESS?

03:11.792 --> 03:15.417
HELLO. MY NAME IS ED.

03:19.083 --> 03:23.833

[GRUNTING]

03:30.208 --> 03:32.542

03:33.958 --> 03:36.500
I SAID "SORRY," BUDDY.

03:36.583 --> 03:39.375
I FORGOT THE CAMERA
AT HOME.

03:39.708 --> 03:42.792
OK, JONNY BOY,
COUGH UP A QUARTER
FOR THE RIDE.

03:42.875 --> 03:44.375
DON'T LOOK AT ME.

03:44.458 --> 03:47.500
GIVE EDDY HIS QUARTER,
PLANK.

03:51.125 --> 03:52.917
PLANK SAYS HE'S BROKE.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.667
NO CASH,
NO BUMPER-CAR RIDE.

03:56.750 --> 03:59.083
I'LL SPOT YOU THIS TIME,
BUT YOU SHOULD LEARN

03:59.167 --> 04:01.458
TO PINCH YOUR PENNIES,
MISTER.

04:01.542 --> 04:03.125
WHAT A PAL.

04:03.208 --> 04:05.875
NOW GET IN THERE
AND BUMP HIM.

04:05.958 --> 04:07.333
PLANK'S GOING
TO BUMP US?

04:07.417 --> 04:10.125
OH, NO! HE'S
GOING TO BUMP US!

04:10.208 --> 04:13.250
WHAT'S HE GOING TO DO--
BOARD US TO DEATH?

04:13.333 --> 04:17.000
OH, LOOK, I'M SCARED STIFF--
STIFF AS A BOARD!

04:17.083 --> 04:19.167
[ED AND EDDY LAUGH]

04:19.000 --> 04:21.292

04:21.375 --> 04:22.708
EDDY, THAT'S ENOUGH.

04:22.792 --> 04:27.167
WHAT, JEALOUS YOU CAN'T
COME UP WITH A BOARD JOKE?

04:27.250 --> 04:29.167
[ALL SCREAM]

04:29.000 --> 04:31.042
THAT-A BOY,
BUDDY!

04:31.125 --> 04:33.000

04:33.083 --> 04:34.875
[SCREAMS]

04:34.958 --> 04:36.833
WAY TO GO, PAL!

04:36.917 --> 04:38.250
AAH!

04:38.333 --> 04:40.917
RIGHT ON!

04:44.708 --> 04:46.917
Ed: FLIP IT!

04:47.000 --> 04:49.375
[LAUGHS]

04:50.375 --> 04:53.000
NO NEED TO SAY
ANYTHING, PLANK,

04:53.083 --> 04:55.167
'CAUSE I WOULD NOT
HEAR IT ANYWAYS.

04:55.250 --> 04:57.708
PLANK SAYS BUMPER CARS
ARE FOR CHICKENS,

04:57.792 --> 04:59.042
AND WHOEVER THOUGHT THAT UP

04:59.125 --> 05:01.000
SHOULD HAVE
THEIR BRAIN LACQUERED.

05:01.083 --> 05:02.417
BOY, BUDDY,
THAT'S HARSH.

05:02.500 --> 05:04.917
NOW, EDDY, LET'S NOT
DO ANYTHING HASTY.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.750
IT'S AN INANIMATE OBJECT,
FOR PETE'S SAKE.

05:07.833 --> 05:10.167
Jonny: WHAT'S THAT,
PLANK--ANOTHER RIDE?

05:10.250 --> 05:13.708
YOU'RE STARTING TO GET
THAT LOOK AGAIN, MISTER.

05:13.792 --> 05:16.208
HOW WAS I TO KNOW PLANK
WAS SUCH AN ANIMAL?

05:16.042 --> 05:17.375
I GOT SOMETHING
TUCKED AWAY

05:17.458 --> 05:20.875
THAT'S SURE TO
CURL HIS SHAVINGS.

05:22.125 --> 05:25.042
Eddy: THIS IS SURE
TO TURN PLANK'S ENDGRAIN.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.375
WELCOME TO
THE LOG OF NO RETURN.

05:27.458 --> 05:29.792
IT'S FAST, THRILLING,
AND WORST OF ALL,

05:29.875 --> 05:33.375
DOUSED WITH DEPRAVED, UPSET,
WOOD-EATING TERMITES.

05:33.458 --> 05:37.167
SHOW 'EM
HOW IT WORKS, LUMPY!

05:41.333 --> 05:42.250
HOLY COW!

05:42.333 --> 05:45.208
WILL PLANK SURVIVE
OR TURN INTO LUNCH

05:45.042 --> 05:47.250
FOR THE REALLY
MIFFED TERMITES?

05:47.333 --> 05:49.125
YOU'RE SCARING HIM,
EDDY.

05:49.208 --> 05:50.375
REST ASSURED, JONNY.

05:50.458 --> 05:52.750
ALL SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
HAVE BEEN TAKEN,

05:52.833 --> 05:54.458
AS SAFETY IS OUR PRIME--

05:54.542 --> 05:56.083
THAT'LL BE 50 CENTS.

05:56.167 --> 05:57.458
SO WILL THAT BE
CASH OR--

05:57.542 --> 06:00.667
50 CENTS?
THE LAST RIDE
WAS A QUARTER!

06:00.750 --> 06:02.917
COME ON, PLANK.

06:05.042 --> 06:06.917
WHAT'D YOU SAY?

06:07.000 --> 06:09.417

MY MIND!

06:34.208 --> 06:36.167
OH...OH...

06:38.708 --> 06:41.542
PLANK! YOU GET BACK HERE!

06:41.625 --> 06:43.333
OH, DARN IT!

06:43.417 --> 06:46.625

A BAD WORD, EDDY.

06:46.708 --> 06:48.167
HOLD ON A SECOND!

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
WHAT ABOUT THE CANDY STORE?

06:50.083 --> 06:54.042
I GOT 75 CENTS.
WHERE YOU GOING?

07:02.208 --> 07:05.125
OH, BROTHER.
YOU GET DOWN FROM THERE!

07:05.208 --> 07:08.500
YOUR INSATIABLE THRILL-SEEKING
IS GIVING ME AN ULCER!

07:08.583 --> 07:10.667
I CAN'T HELP
BUT THINK--

07:10.750 --> 07:12.167
THIS IS YOUR FAULT!

07:12.000 --> 07:14.250
SAFETY PRECAUTIONS

WITH A SAPLING.

08:17.375 --> 08:18.625
YOU WON'T
BELIEVE THIS, GUYS,

08:18.708 --> 08:23.250
BUT THIS CRAZY KID
WANTS TO GO
ON ANOTHER RIDE.

PLANK'S APPETITE
FOR DEATH-DEFYING RIDES

08:27.208 --> 08:28.417
ALMOST GOT US KILLED.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.417
WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE THAT THING HOME

08:30.500 --> 08:31.917
AND STAIN IT
OR SOMETHING?

08:32.000 --> 08:34.917
Jonny: PLANK SAYS,
"LET'S TALK CASH."

08:35.000 --> 08:36.167
I'M LISTENING.

WELCOME TO REQUIEM
FOR A WHIPLASH.

BE NICE TO ME.

09:15.750 --> 09:17.583
IT'LL COST YOU
A BUCK TO RIDE.

09:17.667 --> 09:20.083
ONE DOLLAR? PLANK,
I GOT A FEELING

09:20.167 --> 09:23.250
