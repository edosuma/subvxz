00:45.877 --> 00:48.272
That's how he became
Sergeant Eye-Gouger.

00:48.397 --> 00:50.073
I love an origin story.

Just let it go, Dad.

00:55.437 --> 00:56.446
You want to throw down?

00:56.571 --> 00:57.464
I'll throw down.

00:57.589 --> 00:58.582
You got my back?

00:58.707 --> 00:59.550
I'll scratch your back.

00:59.675 --> 01:01.185
I can do the backstroke.

I'm coming, Dad.

01:29.037 --> 01:32.592

01:41.583 --> 01:42.978
Where'd you go?

01:43.144 --> 01:44.228
I got the usher.

01:44.353 --> 01:45.379
I almost died.

01:45.504 --> 01:47.514
I almost died, too... of shock.

01:47.639 --> 01:50.083
I accidentally ran
into a Hugh Grant movie.

01:50.208 --> 01:53.737
Ugh. Such a youthful haircut
on such an old face.

01:55.230 --> 01:56.323
Take that!

01:56.448 --> 01:57.674
She didn't do anything.

01:57.799 --> 01:59.393
No turning it off now!

02:06.708 --> 02:09.151
Who beat the candy out of you?

02:09.276 --> 02:11.271
Some guy popped off
in the movie theater,

02:11.396 --> 02:13.173
and I had to be totally heroic,
big-time.

02:13.298 --> 02:16.317
Steve had the opportunity
to help, but instead he left,

02:16.594 --> 02:18.562
like that little piggy
in the straw house

02:18.687 --> 02:20.647
who ran away from the Big Bad Dragon.

02:20.772 --> 02:22.232
I don't know if I have that right,

02:22.357 --> 02:23.800
but it's in the Bible, Steve.

02:23.925 --> 02:25.102
Don't worry, Dad.

02:25.227 --> 02:27.004
I'll be brave next time
something happens.

02:27.129 --> 02:28.672
You can't make a plan to be brave.

02:28.797 --> 02:30.908
Brave is either something
you are or you're not,

02:31.033 --> 02:32.843
and you are not.

02:32.968 --> 02:35.662
Hey, hey, don't be so down, buddy.

02:35.787 --> 02:37.798
There is something you are.

02:37.923 --> 02:39.733
You are...

02:39.858 --> 02:40.820
It!

02:45.932 --> 02:48.108
Francine, you were
unusually quiet this evening.

02:48.233 --> 02:49.693
Is that going to be a new thing?

02:49.818 --> 02:50.894
I like it.

02:51.019 --> 02:52.563
Stan, I'm late for my period.

02:52.688 --> 02:53.947
Maybe if you jump up and down,

02:54.072 --> 02:55.048
get things started.

02:55.173 --> 02:56.384
I might be pregnant.

02:56.550 --> 02:58.018
What?! How is that possible?

02:58.143 --> 02:59.553
I got a vasectomy.

02:59.678 --> 03:03.190
You got some sort of weird
automated Japanese vasectomy,

03:03.315 --> 03:04.958
and you've never done anything

03:05.083 --> 03:07.521
about the 30 recall
postcards they sent us.

03:09.772 --> 03:11.431
No! This is a disaster.

03:11.556 --> 03:12.766
I don't want another child.

03:12.891 --> 03:15.669
I just took the safety latches
off the toilet seats.

03:15.794 --> 03:17.489
Aah! I'm drowning!

03:17.729 --> 03:19.723
Listen, I don't want a baby, either.

03:19.848 --> 03:21.658
Trading sushi and bourbon

03:21.783 --> 03:23.794
for hemorrhoids and swollen boobs?

03:23.919 --> 03:25.163
Screw that.

03:25.329 --> 03:26.663
What are we going to...

03:26.788 --> 03:28.632
Francine, can we move
this conversation

03:28.757 --> 03:30.033
to the top of the staircase?

03:30.158 --> 03:32.569
It's too early to push me
down the stairs, Stan.

03:32.694 --> 03:34.471
I'm not even sure if I'm pregnant.

03:34.596 --> 03:36.239
I'll take a pregnancy test.

03:36.364 --> 03:38.108
Well, if you're going
to take a pregnancy test,

03:38.233 --> 03:39.359
you're going to have to pee.

03:39.484 --> 03:40.577
Let me get you some water.

03:40.702 --> 03:41.805
I'll get my own water.

03:41.971 --> 03:42.764
Damn.

03:49.461 --> 03:51.271
Hey, Dad, how brave is this?

03:51.396 --> 03:53.690
I have less than ten
percent battery life,

03:53.815 --> 03:55.125
and I just started an e-mail.

03:57.719 --> 03:59.463
Mmm. Mmm.

03:59.588 --> 04:01.031
Geez, Mr. S.

04:01.156 --> 04:03.910
Nailing your daughter
makes me super hungry.

04:04.076 --> 04:05.152
Let's not talk about sex.

04:05.277 --> 04:06.503
I'm pissed at sex.

04:06.628 --> 04:08.081
Francine might be pregnant.

04:08.313 --> 04:09.356
- What?!
- What?!

04:09.481 --> 04:10.757
I can't handle another child

04:10.882 --> 04:13.010
chipping away
at the heroic Smith name.

04:13.135 --> 04:14.444
Well, you never know.

04:14.569 --> 04:17.230
My dad, for some reason,
thinks I'm an idiot,

04:17.355 --> 04:19.009
but he loves my younger brother.

04:19.175 --> 04:20.951
I hadn't thought of that.

04:21.076 --> 04:22.419
Yes.

04:22.544 --> 04:25.555
The new baby could be
the son I never had.

04:25.680 --> 04:26.857
Alive over here.

04:26.982 --> 04:28.977
He could be brave and have my back.

04:29.143 --> 04:31.028
I'll name him...
something strong.

04:31.153 --> 04:32.496
Steve.

04:32.621 --> 04:33.857
Already named Steve over here.

04:34.023 --> 04:35.298
We'll change your name.

04:35.423 --> 04:37.501
You can... you can call
yourself Eve, like the douche.

04:37.626 --> 04:39.703
Jeff, I'm ready to go again!

04:39.828 --> 04:41.304
Whoa. I'm tired.

04:41.429 --> 04:43.631
Anyone else want to tag in?

04:51.323 --> 04:53.233
Roger, I really need some advice.

04:53.358 --> 04:55.435
Always happy
to dispense sound judgment.

04:55.560 --> 04:56.870
It's my dad.

04:56.995 --> 04:58.506
He thinks I'm a coward.

04:58.730 --> 05:00.557
But if I do something
to show him I'm brave,

05:00.682 --> 05:01.925
he says it won't mean anything

05:02.050 --> 05:03.493
because I'm trying
to prove I'm brave.

05:03.618 --> 05:04.804
It's a conundrum.

05:05.020 --> 05:07.030
The harder I try, the
less he'll think of me.

05:07.155 --> 05:08.832
I thought a conundrum was a word

05:08.957 --> 05:10.434
that's the same forward and back.

05:10.559 --> 05:11.668
No. Th-that's a palin...

05:11.793 --> 05:13.203
Do not shame me.

05:13.328 --> 05:15.839
Anyway, there's nothing I
can do to change his mind.

05:15.964 --> 05:17.943
I'll always be a wimp in his eyes.

05:18.109 --> 05:20.946
This certainly is a palindrome.

05:21.186 --> 05:22.846
I got it.
Here's what we do.

05:22.971 --> 05:25.799
We dress you up in a masked
superhero costume.

05:25.924 --> 05:28.552
You do something brave,
and I catch it all on video.

05:28.677 --> 05:30.914
Then... this is good...
we get that video

05:31.080 --> 05:33.123
to Greg and Terry,
who show it on the news.

05:33.248 --> 05:36.026
While your dad is watching
their report, you, Steve,

05:36.151 --> 05:38.895
will walk through the room
letting the superhero outfit

05:39.020 --> 05:41.091
"accidentally" fall out
of your backpack.

05:41.257 --> 05:44.534
This way, your dad will realize
you're acting mild-mannered

05:44.659 --> 05:46.346
to hide your true brave identity.

05:46.512 --> 05:47.430
All right.

05:47.729 --> 05:50.207
And we get to dress you up
in a superhero outfit.

05:50.332 --> 05:51.975
Qui-Lo!

05:52.100 --> 05:53.610
Qui-Lo, cape or no cape?

06:04.079 --> 06:06.022
Which one of you
doesn't want the cape?

06:06.147 --> 06:07.657
Oh, no, we both do.

06:07.782 --> 06:10.704
We're just arguing
about who loves them more.

06:17.790 --> 06:21.271
The night belongs to me, for I am...

06:21.396 --> 06:24.207
Greater Chimdale County Man.

06:24.332 --> 06:26.834
No! That name's terrible!

06:30.306 --> 06:32.834
Filming your bravery
is just the excuse

06:32.959 --> 06:34.903
I've been looking for
to buy a video camera.

06:35.028 --> 06:37.789
I broke my last one making
a short film about butts.

06:37.914 --> 06:40.592
7,000 hours of footage
down the drain.

06:40.717 --> 06:42.694
I'm going to grab some
Neosporin from my room

06:42.819 --> 06:44.429
in case I get a boo-boo
fighting crime.

06:44.554 --> 06:46.197
Oh, can I borrow a tank top?

06:46.322 --> 06:48.933
I don't feel great
with what I'm wearing.

06:49.058 --> 06:51.286
Just way too much sleeve for me.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.913
Feel like I'm 90% sleeve over here.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.059
Dad, what are you doing?

06:58.184 --> 06:59.919
Turning your room into a nursery.

07:00.153 --> 07:02.263
To inspire new Steve
not to be a wuss,

07:02.388 --> 07:05.216
I'm painting scenes from
John McCain's life on the walls.

07:05.382 --> 07:07.335
Here's him getting
his legs broken by the VC.

07:07.460 --> 07:09.437
That wall there portrays him

07:09.562 --> 07:10.972
selecting Sarah Palin
as a running mate

07:11.097 --> 07:12.540
without knowing
the first thing about her.

07:12.665 --> 07:15.310
And here's him chewing off
his own cancerous mole.

07:15.568 --> 07:17.979
Yeah, well, I'm just
a mild-mannered kid,

07:18.104 --> 07:20.606
so I wouldn't relate to any of that.

07:22.242 --> 07:23.618
Now you hit on me?!

07:23.743 --> 07:26.154
After all these years
of rebuffing my advances,

07:26.279 --> 07:29.040
now I'm finally moving on,
and you have the audacity to...

07:29.165 --> 07:30.700
Oh, I get it now.
Never mind.

07:30.866 --> 07:33.144
Anyway, I invited McCain
to a heroes' brunch

07:33.269 --> 07:34.446
I'm throwing here at the house.

07:34.571 --> 07:35.647
A heroes' brunch?

07:35.772 --> 07:37.382
Yep, I'll be French toasting it up

07:37.507 --> 07:39.084
with a few of our nation's bravest.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.019
I really think McCain might come.

07:41.144 --> 07:43.088
I made his invitation super fancy.

07:45.648 --> 07:46.975
Glitter?

07:47.100 --> 07:48.885
Oh, come on!
It's everywhere!

07:51.621 --> 07:52.881
Excuse me.
What's the difference

07:53.006 --> 07:54.916
between digital zoom
and optical zoom?

07:55.041 --> 07:56.284
They're the same thing.

07:56.409 --> 07:57.952
But the box says they're different.

07:58.077 --> 07:59.954
Oh, yeah, it does.

08:00.079 --> 08:01.723
I guess they're different.

08:01.848 --> 08:04.159
Let me know if you need
any further assistance.

08:04.284 --> 08:05.493
Thank you.

08:05.618 --> 08:07.403
I thanked him.
Why did I thank him?

08:07.569 --> 08:08.930
Just buy it.

08:09.055 --> 08:11.232
I can't wait to prove
to my dad that I'm brave.

08:11.357 --> 08:13.268
After tonight,
he's going to love me more

08:13.393 --> 08:16.371
than my unborn, unconfirmed,
maybe baby brother.

08:16.629 --> 08:18.907
Maybe baby.
Maybe baby.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.175
That's fun to say.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.476
Maybe baby.

08:21.601 --> 08:22.577
Maybe baby.

08:22.702 --> 08:24.087
Maybe baby.
Maybe baby.

08:24.253 --> 08:25.663
Maybe baby.
Maybe baby.

08:25.788 --> 08:26.965
Maybe baby.
Maybe baby.

08:27.090 --> 08:28.366
Maybe baby.
Maybe baby.

08:28.491 --> 08:29.634
Maybe baby.
Maybe baby.
Maybe baby.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.035
Maybe baby.
Maybe baby.
Maybe baby.

08:31.160 --> 08:32.437
Maybe baby.
Maybe baby.

08:32.562 --> 08:34.506
Maybe baby.
Maybe baby.
Maybe baby.

08:34.631 --> 08:36.441
Maybe baby.
Maybe baby.
Maybe baby.

08:36.566 --> 08:38.393
Maybe baby.

08:41.621 --> 08:44.107
- So did you take the pregnancy test?
- I did.

08:44.273 --> 08:46.276
And? Am I going to be a father again?

08:46.509 --> 08:49.187
Well, I didn't have a
home pregnancy test,

08:49.312 --> 08:50.822
so I had to take one online.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.490
I'm waiting for the doctor

08:52.615 --> 08:53.942
to e-mail me back with the results.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.244
How do you take a pregnancy test
over the computer?

08:56.410 --> 08:58.279
Well, per instruction,

08:58.404 --> 09:00.498
I first took several
pictures of my genitals.

09:00.740 --> 09:02.734
You what?
And then one of me peeing

09:02.859 --> 09:05.420
on a teddy bear,
and sent them to the doctor.

09:05.586 --> 09:07.255
I-I don't think, uh, that...

09:07.380 --> 09:08.473
that-that's...
that's real.

09:08.598 --> 09:10.358
He's a legitimate doctor, Stan.

09:10.483 --> 09:11.718
See for yourself.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.847
That must be the result.

09:15.972 --> 09:18.140
Oh, God, here goes.

09:19.575 --> 09:21.986
Oh. Dr. Vadgers says my lab work

09:22.111 --> 09:23.738
requires more information.

09:23.863 --> 09:25.707
He needs to see my boobs

09:25.832 --> 09:28.810
popping out of a cheerleading outfit.

09:28.935 --> 09:30.478
I know what you're thinking.

09:30.603 --> 09:32.697
What is the boob test
going to tell him

09:32.822 --> 09:34.716
that the butthole test didn't?

09:34.841 --> 09:37.202
He's just being super careful.

09:39.870 --> 09:42.924
Are you sure criminals will be
intimidated by my outfit?

09:43.049 --> 09:44.509
It's not an outfit, Steve.

09:44.634 --> 09:45.843
It's called a onesie.

09:49.088 --> 09:52.091
Sounds like someone
is in need of help.

09:54.494 --> 09:56.638
Oh, my God.
This woman is repeatedly

09:56.763 --> 09:58.506
head-butting this man in the stomach!

09:58.631 --> 10:00.441
Yes, Steve, that's
exactly what's happening.

10:00.566 --> 10:02.543
Sir, I am here to stop this.

10:02.668 --> 10:05.380
Excuse me. Is that the XLR Mega-Zoom?

10:05.505 --> 10:06.731
I just got the same one.

10:06.897 --> 10:09.400
If you don't mind my asking,
what'd you pay?

10:09.566 --> 10:11.135
You won't be undersold?

10:11.260 --> 10:13.271
Try this same camcorder at Montie's

10:13.396 --> 10:14.672
for $20 less!

10:14.797 --> 10:16.124
Do you have your receipt?

10:16.249 --> 10:17.342
No, I don't have a receipt!

10:17.467 --> 10:19.160
I stole the floor model.

10:19.419 --> 10:21.996
I can't believe we've been
walking around all night

10:22.121 --> 10:23.298
and couldn't find one crime.

10:23.423 --> 10:25.266
This neighborhood's gotten too safe

10:25.391 --> 10:26.667
since the Blacks moved out.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.586
David and Franklin Black,

10:28.711 --> 10:31.873
two white brothers who killed
every Mexican in town.

10:31.998 --> 10:34.258
Look what they're
doing to that monument.

10:34.383 --> 10:36.661
It's Langley Falls'
most sacred memorial,

10:36.786 --> 10:40.139
commemorating the victims
of the Great Bus Crash of 2010.

10:40.305 --> 10:41.683
This is your big chance.

10:41.808 --> 10:44.676
Go stop those hooligans,
and I'll film the whole thing.

10:47.430 --> 10:50.141
I demand you cease
your criminal mischief.

10:52.351 --> 10:54.462
Look how round this kid's head is.

10:54.587 --> 10:56.731
Its geometrical perfection
is unnerving.

10:56.856 --> 10:58.066
Let's beat him up.

10:58.191 --> 10:59.450
Roger, the...
the plan's not working.

11:00.676 --> 11:02.887
Run if you want to run...
I mean live.

11:04.288 --> 11:06.791
That didn't work at all.

11:06.916 --> 11:07.959
Sure it did.

11:08.084 --> 11:09.427
I have the whole thing on film.

11:09.552 --> 11:10.995
But I wasn't courageous.

11:11.120 --> 11:12.330
No, you weren't.

11:12.455 --> 11:15.333
Danger reared its ugly head
and you folded faster

11:15.458 --> 11:17.068
than a chain of Rhea Perlman-themed

11:17.193 --> 11:18.836
all-you-can-eat diarrhea restaurants

11:18.961 --> 11:21.139
named Diarrhea Perlman's.

11:22.832 --> 11:24.058
But you don't have to be brave,

11:24.224 --> 11:26.210
you just have to look
brave for your dad.

11:26.335 --> 11:27.478
That's the beauty of movies.

11:27.603 --> 11:29.047
I snip out the part where you were

11:29.172 --> 11:30.481
a raging nancy sissy

11:30.606 --> 11:32.717
and edit it to make you
out to be the hero.

11:32.842 --> 11:34.027
You can do that?

11:34.193 --> 11:36.020
Uh, yeah, Steve, I'm a
professional film editor.

11:36.145 --> 11:37.288
I can do anything.

11:37.413 --> 11:39.524
Tyler Perry's movies are
actually quite good

11:39.649 --> 11:41.617
before I get my hands on them.

11:41.783 --> 11:44.954
All right, now we drop it
at Greg and Terry's.

11:52.945 --> 11:54.972
Campy.

11:55.097 --> 11:59.677
♪ Yes, I like piña coladas
and getting caught in the... ♪

11:59.802 --> 12:01.753
Not now.
Then when?

12:04.056 --> 12:08.169
Who rings the doorbell
at 3:00 in the morning?

12:08.294 --> 12:09.687
Weirdos.

12:12.356 --> 12:14.876
Stan, the news is on.

12:15.001 --> 12:16.694
Turn to channel three quick.

12:16.936 --> 12:19.080
We secretly acquired
this exclusive video

12:19.205 --> 12:20.314
late last night.

12:20.439 --> 12:22.050
The contents will shock you.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.918
But there's no need to fret,
Langley Falls.

12:24.043 --> 12:26.663
The masked hero...
has arrived.

12:26.829 --> 12:29.540
Take it easy, shouting
guy from the B-52's.

12:30.431 --> 12:33.468
I demand you cease
your criminal mischief.

12:36.255 --> 12:38.216
That's one brave S.O.B.

12:39.550 --> 12:41.035
Okay, this is your moment.

12:41.160 --> 12:42.720
Thanks, Roger.

12:42.886 --> 12:44.772
You're welcome, champ.

12:44.897 --> 12:46.641
I do it because I care.

12:46.933 --> 12:48.860
You know what would
be good right now?

12:48.985 --> 12:50.261
Not "The Piña Colada Song."

12:53.706 --> 12:55.450
Whoa, Steve, there's your own shadow.

12:55.575 --> 12:56.768
Try not to be scared.

12:56.893 --> 12:59.112
Oops.

12:59.278 --> 13:00.421
Where is it?

13:00.546 --> 13:01.572
It has to be here.

13:03.833 --> 13:06.127
Hold on there, stranger
in my living room.

13:07.687 --> 13:11.332
Roger?! You?!

13:11.457 --> 13:14.268
You're Langley Falls' masked hero?!

13:14.393 --> 13:17.171
Oh, my God, I didn't realize
I was wearing this.

13:17.296 --> 13:18.940
You found me out.

13:19.065 --> 13:21.275
You discovered my true identity.

13:21.400 --> 13:22.802
Something I never wanted to happen.

13:23.069 --> 13:25.304
I now look at you
in a whole new light.

13:25.538 --> 13:28.181
I would be proud to shake your hand.

13:28.526 --> 13:30.234
Do you have a name, Roger?

13:30.359 --> 13:32.537
Greater Chimdale County Man.

13:32.662 --> 13:34.512
Awesome.

13:42.487 --> 13:45.049
How come I didn't see it coming?

13:45.174 --> 13:47.084
There, there.

13:47.209 --> 13:48.753
I should have known better,

13:48.878 --> 13:51.071
but then you said you were
doing it because you care.

13:51.196 --> 13:52.290
I do care, kiddo.

13:52.456 --> 13:54.091
I care about me.

13:54.216 --> 13:55.893
Now shh.

13:56.018 --> 13:57.461
If it makes you feel any better,

13:57.586 --> 13:59.347
it wasn't my plan the whole time.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.883
As soon as I heard your dad was
having that heroes' brunch,

14:02.008 --> 14:03.484
I decided to throw you under the bus.

14:03.609 --> 14:04.886
I love brunch, Steve.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.487
I love everything about it.

14:06.612 --> 14:07.755
I love drinking too much,

14:07.880 --> 14:09.924
blowing off my afternoon plans,
sleeping,

14:10.049 --> 14:12.093
waking up disoriented...

14:12.218 --> 14:13.844
You are something else, Roger.

14:13.969 --> 14:15.913
Hey, it's not like
you were even a real hero.

14:16.038 --> 14:17.882
I held up a gun and the kids ran off.

14:18.007 --> 14:19.567
You'd be living a lie.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.135
Is that what you want to do, Steve?

14:21.260 --> 14:22.837
Live a lie?

14:22.962 --> 14:24.996
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a lie to live.

14:31.837 --> 14:33.338
Now, now. We've had enough of this.

14:38.010 --> 14:40.221
That's a little trick
I learned to quiet newborns

14:40.346 --> 14:41.656
when I worked in the maternity ward.

14:43.349 --> 14:45.893
Quite a few people are still
looking for this little lady,

14:46.018 --> 14:47.386
I'll tell you that much.

14:48.804 --> 14:51.479
Anyone in here?

14:51.604 --> 14:52.646
There you are.

14:52.771 --> 14:54.227
Steve, it's not a good time.

14:54.393 --> 14:55.561
Dad thinks I'm a coward and...

14:55.727 --> 14:57.230
Mommy is very stressed.

14:57.396 --> 14:59.787
And then I was about
to change his mind,

14:59.912 --> 15:00.888
but you know what Roger did?

15:01.013 --> 15:02.757
Put a sock in it, Steve.

15:02.882 --> 15:05.659
Stop worrying about what
your father thinks of you.

15:05.784 --> 15:08.824
For God's sake,
you're almost 15 years old.

15:08.990 --> 15:11.953
If you lived in Fresno
you'd be a father by now.

15:12.119 --> 15:15.636
Wow. Tough love.

15:15.761 --> 15:17.166
You're right.

15:17.332 --> 15:19.240
Thanks for the wake-up call.

15:19.365 --> 15:21.358
I'm gonna look back
on this day and...

15:21.483 --> 15:24.211
Okay, your time's up.
Get out.

15:24.336 --> 15:26.133
Mommy's strong.

15:34.063 --> 15:36.140
There's nothing like
a heroes' brunch.

15:36.265 --> 15:38.542
We have Lauren, the hero
of the movie theater

15:38.667 --> 15:41.566
- and the masked hero of Langley Falls...
- Present.

15:46.611 --> 15:48.285
... and the hero of the Hudson...

15:48.410 --> 15:50.074
Sully Sullenberger.

15:53.744 --> 15:57.294
Sully, you nimble Irish bastard.

15:57.419 --> 15:59.497
Mr. Sullenberger,
I admire what you're doing

15:59.622 --> 16:00.831
with the whole hero thing.

16:00.956 --> 16:02.066
You know how to do it right.

16:02.191 --> 16:03.337
I appreciate that, son.

16:03.503 --> 16:04.568
No, I mean it.

16:04.693 --> 16:06.337
You are milking the hell out of it.

16:06.462 --> 16:08.305
You went to the presidential
inauguration,

16:08.430 --> 16:09.974
you were introduced
at the World Series,

16:10.099 --> 16:11.509
you were on all the talk shows,

16:11.634 --> 16:13.306
you get the key to any city you want.

16:13.472 --> 16:14.728
Have you gotten to pull the switch

16:14.853 --> 16:15.896
on the electric chair yet?

16:16.021 --> 16:17.164
That's what I'm trying to get.

16:17.289 --> 16:18.532
I hear, during electrocutions

16:18.657 --> 16:21.101
bodily functions may "let go."

16:21.226 --> 16:22.940
That would be fun to see.

16:23.106 --> 16:26.740
Mom really showed me something
when she was on the toilet.

16:26.865 --> 16:28.175
I just want you to know

16:28.300 --> 16:30.489
that I'm going to stop trying
to prove myself to you.

16:30.655 --> 16:35.244
As of this moment, I've stopped
caring what you think of me.

16:35.410 --> 16:38.539
Now I'm going to get on with my life.

16:38.705 --> 16:40.020
Who was that?

16:40.145 --> 16:41.355
His name is Eve.

16:41.480 --> 16:43.377
Like the douche?

16:49.883 --> 16:52.590
Well, I don't need this anymore.

16:57.099 --> 17:01.325
Oh, hey...
I'm in Old Langley...

17:01.450 --> 17:03.856
I think it's A...
No, uh, B...

17:06.441 --> 17:09.183
Either way, it's hepatitis
and now you have it, too.

17:09.308 --> 17:10.251
My baby!

17:10.376 --> 17:11.876
My baby's in that car!

17:19.663 --> 17:21.969
♪

18:04.082 --> 18:05.806
My baby!

18:05.931 --> 18:08.337
Masked man, thank you
so much for saving my baby.

18:08.503 --> 18:11.295
It was very brave what you did.

18:11.420 --> 18:13.831
No, ma'am, it is you
who has helped me.

18:13.956 --> 18:16.767
All this time I was hoping
my dad would think I'm brave,

18:16.892 --> 18:20.804
but now I know I'm brave,
and that's all that counts.

18:20.929 --> 18:22.406
What the hell was he talking about?

18:22.531 --> 18:24.041
Kid's probably on drugs.

18:24.166 --> 18:25.817
I know I am.

18:36.044 --> 18:38.389
Mm. This is good sorbet.

18:38.514 --> 18:39.540
All right, I'm saying it.

18:39.665 --> 18:40.975
Why is he even here?

18:41.100 --> 18:43.310
He's just a guy who landed
a plane in a river

18:43.435 --> 18:44.707
to save his own ass.

18:44.873 --> 18:46.780
You want to be a real hero?

18:46.905 --> 18:48.882
Avoid the geese like
all the other pilots do

18:49.007 --> 18:50.467
every single day.

18:50.592 --> 18:51.630
You're right.

18:51.796 --> 18:53.387
She's right.

18:53.512 --> 18:56.023
But I'm right, too.
This is good sorbet.

18:56.148 --> 18:58.637
This just in.
The masked hero strikes again.

18:58.803 --> 19:01.762
This was submitted
by an amateur videographer.

19:01.887 --> 19:04.865
It was shot in what is
known as "Bajowski Alley."

19:04.990 --> 19:07.368
Didn't they honor you with
a star on the walk there?

19:07.493 --> 19:08.802
Stop it.

19:08.927 --> 19:10.120
Roll the footage.

19:10.245 --> 19:14.224
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

19:14.349 --> 19:16.238
Oh, God.

19:16.535 --> 19:18.824
Oh, God.

19:18.990 --> 19:21.015
How is this possible?

19:21.140 --> 19:22.950
You were with me the whole day.

19:23.075 --> 19:24.218
That must mean...

19:24.343 --> 19:25.452
Maybe baby.

19:25.577 --> 19:27.421
You can't be the masked hero.

19:27.546 --> 19:29.923
I refuse to answer any questions
without my lawyer present.

19:30.048 --> 19:31.392
Fine.

19:31.517 --> 19:33.427
I'll get the truth out of you
one way or the other.

19:33.552 --> 19:35.646
Lauren, grab your flashlight.

19:35.771 --> 19:37.009
I got my shot in.

19:37.175 --> 19:39.924
I can hold my head up high
no matter what happens.

19:43.162 --> 19:45.434
We should think
about recessed lighting.

19:49.001 --> 19:50.711
Hey there.

19:50.836 --> 19:52.379
Hey.

19:52.504 --> 19:54.815
So, what were you up to today?

19:54.940 --> 19:56.123
Nothing much.

19:58.193 --> 20:00.371
I know you're the masked hero.

20:00.496 --> 20:02.856
Roger told me everything.

20:02.981 --> 20:05.959
I misjudged you, kiddo.

20:06.084 --> 20:08.695
I thought you were a wuss
and you proved me wrong.

20:08.820 --> 20:10.697
And you didn't even brag about it.

20:10.822 --> 20:12.900
That's a real hero.

20:13.025 --> 20:15.526
And I would be proud
to shake your hand.

20:18.008 --> 20:19.773
Could I keep my name then, Dad?

20:19.898 --> 20:21.208
Of course, buddy.

20:21.333 --> 20:22.910
We'll name the other kid
something else.

20:23.035 --> 20:25.145
You know, I really think
your mom's gonna come around

20:25.270 --> 20:26.809
to having another baby in the house.

20:26.975 --> 20:28.936
Yeah!

20:31.994 --> 20:36.664
I just got the biggest,
bloodiest period of all time.
