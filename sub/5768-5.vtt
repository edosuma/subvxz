ALICIA:
Previously on The Good Wife:

00:02.670 --> 00:05.264
Your firm is representing
Lemond Bishop, the drug dealer.

00:05.300 --> 00:07.530
We only handle
his legitimate business.

00:07.570 --> 00:09.538
I don't_ like the FBI
coming to me.

00:09.570 --> 00:11.128
We're taking care of it.

00:11.170 --> 00:13.229
I am thinking about
contributing to your campaign.

00:13.280 --> 00:15.271
Really?
I like your wife.

00:15.310 --> 00:16.675
NICK:
I'm new to town,

00:16.710 --> 00:18.678
and the government
is putting out an RFP

00:18.710 --> 00:20.610
to outsource its
tow truck serVIce,

00:20.650 --> 00:22.208
but... they won't let me bid.

00:22.250 --> 00:23.239
He's my husband.

00:23.290 --> 00:25.110
Is he dangerous--
your husband?
I don't know.

00:28.560 --> 00:31.552
(Bach's "Ode to Joy"
played out of tune on violin)

00:44.740 --> 00:46.708
DYLAN :
Dad.

00:46.740 --> 00:48.230
Yeah. I got your lunch.

00:48.280 --> 00:49.304
You hear anything?

00:49.350 --> 00:50.305
About what?

00:50.350 --> 00:52.318
Damien's mom.
DId she call?

00:52.350 --> 00:54.147
Don't worry. She'll call.

00:54.180 --> 00:55.374
Did you get the bounce house?

00:55.420 --> 00:57.843
I got the bounce house.

00:57.890 --> 01:00.313
Now go learn to break a brick
with your forehead, hmm?

01:01.390 --> 01:02.550
Love you, Dad.

01:02.590 --> 01:05.559
(cell phone ringing)

01:05.590 --> 01:07.854
(second cell phone ringing)

01:07.900 --> 01:09.868
(ringing)

01:09.900 --> 01:12.334
(third cell phone ringing)

01:17.210 --> 01:19.735
(other phones continue ringing)

01:19.780 --> 01:21.338
Yeah?

01:21.380 --> 01:23.371
(swing music plays)

01:26.420 --> 01:27.614
Thanks.

01:27.650 --> 01:30.881
* Oh, I could tell them
to shove it *

01:30.920 --> 01:33.457
* I could tell_ them
to shove It *

01:33.490 --> 01:35.515
* Oh, I could tell them
to shove it *

01:35.560 --> 01:39.121
* The devil don't have
no wmgs *

01:39.160 --> 01:40.627
ALICIA:
Jackie.

01:43.670 --> 01:45.160
Jackie.

01:47.700 --> 01:48.769
What?

01:48.800 --> 01:50.131
Are you okay?

01:50.170 --> 01:51.899
MADDIE:
Alicia, hi.

01:51.940 --> 01:53.578
I've been looking
all over for you.

01:53.610 --> 01:54.577
Maddie.

01:54.610 --> 01:55.634
This is Jackie Florrick.

01:55.680 --> 01:56.772
It's very nice

01:56.810 --> 01:58.573
to finally meet you,
Mrs. Florrick.

01:58.610 --> 02:00.669
Why, thank you.
And you are...?

02:00.720 --> 02:02.415
The money.
Oh.

02:02.450 --> 02:03.519
Then the pleasure is all mine.

02:03.550 --> 02:05.882
MADDIE:
Do you mind ifI steal
your daughter-in-law?

02:05.920 --> 02:07.182
There's some people
I'd like to introduce her to.

02:07.220 --> 02:08.756
Alicia's the belle of the ball.

02:08.790 --> 02:11.156
Be my guest.

02:11.190 --> 02:12.657
(cell phone ringing)
Oh. Just one sec, Maddie.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.691
"Belle of the ball?"

02:15.800 --> 02:17.199
Hi, Diane.

02:17.230 --> 02:19.164
Did you...?

02:19.200 --> 02:20.167
Where?

02:20.200 --> 02:22.168
3434 Lakeview.

02:22.210 --> 02:23.859
I'm sorry to do this to you,
but he requested us.

02:23.910 --> 02:25.207
ALICIA:
No, that's all right.

02:25.240 --> 02:26.309
Um, I'll be right there.

02:26.340 --> 02:27.329
Okay.

02:29.380 --> 02:31.348
You have to take off?
Work.

02:31.380 --> 02:33.348
Are we still on
for drinks later?
I wouldn't miss it.

02:33.380 --> 02:35.268
Great.

02:35.320 --> 02:36.844
ELI:
...and ifI were you,
Jimmy V.,

02:36.890 --> 02:38.187
I would take a breath

02:38.220 --> 02:39.585
before I posted
anything actionable.

02:39.620 --> 02:40.712
JIMMY:
Is that your quote?

02:40.760 --> 02:41.715
(sighs)

02:41.760 --> 02:42.852
What's the blog?

02:42.890 --> 02:44.858
Pooranarchy.com. All one word.

02:44.890 --> 02:46.528
Never heard of it.

02:46.560 --> 02:48.425
You will. In about one hour
because that's when I'm posting

02:48.460 --> 02:50.667
that a national news magazine
is sitting on a story

02:50.700 --> 02:52.793
accusing Peter Florrick of
sleeping with a campaign worker.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.468
Okay, give me your number; I'll
get a quote from the candidate.

02:55.500 --> 02:57.263
Hang on.

02:57.310 --> 02:59.301
Come here.

03:02.010 --> 03:03.272
Okay.

03:04.310 --> 03:06.312
Yep.

03:06.350 --> 03:07.715
Okay. I'll call you back.

03:08.750 --> 03:09.785
Where's the candidate?

03:09.820 --> 03:10.980
Take it off!
Come on!

03:11.020 --> 03:12.214
Where's the candidate?

03:23.330 --> 03:25.469
Oh, um...

03:25.500 --> 03:26.694
I'm here for Mr. Bishop.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.992
I'm Alicia Florrick.
Lockhart/Gardner.

03:29.040 --> 03:30.735
Oh, yeah.

03:30.770 --> 03:33.637
Lesli Rand.
Cutner & Paradini.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.739
Ah, you're Mr. Bishop's
other law firm.

03:35.780 --> 03:37.600
His primary law firm, yeah.

03:37.650 --> 03:41.518
I didn't realize he had
a primary law firm.

03:42.550 --> 03:43.847
Are we gonna be enemies?

03:43.890 --> 03:46.017
Depends.

03:46.050 --> 03:47.415
You're the lawyers.

03:47.460 --> 03:48.586
Why am I telling you this?

03:48.620 --> 03:50.451
LESLI:
I'm not hearing anything
about an arrest, Lemond.

03:50.490 --> 03:52.993
We overreact,
we set something in motion.

03:53.030 --> 03:55.225
And we und_erreact
and I end up In prison.

03:57.370 --> 03:58.325
What do you think?

03:58.370 --> 03:59.894
Who called you
about the arrest?

03:59.940 --> 04:00.861
BISHOP:
My accounting firm.

04:00.900 --> 04:02.800
I had an appointment,
and they cancelled,

04:02.840 --> 04:03.932
saying my accountant,
Mr. Stiglitz,

04:03.970 --> 04:06.336
had been arrested at his home.
ALICIA:
Was there any

04:06.380 --> 04:07.699
search warrant served
at hIs office?

04:09.850 --> 04:11.704
So at least they don't have
any of his work product.

04:11.750 --> 04:14.048
I'll have our lawyers cover
state and federal bond court.

04:14.080 --> 04:15.718
Well, unfortunately,
bond hearings take place

04:15.750 --> 04:17.547
the day after an arrest,

04:17.590 --> 04:19.285
so if there's anything
to worry about, then...

04:19.320 --> 04:20.582
that's too late.

04:20.620 --> 04:22.884
Meaning my accountant
makes a deal.
Yes.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.023
We've got friends
among the cops.

04:27.460 --> 04:28.927
And since this is probably
a drug-related issue,

04:28.960 --> 04:30.666
do you want us to help
Cutner & Paradini

04:30.700 --> 04:32.736
look through their
legal work?

04:32.770 --> 04:33.862
We're fine. Thank you.

04:34.840 --> 04:37.365
God. I'm surrounded by women.

04:37.410 --> 04:40.573
Look, this is why I pay you
two law firms a lot of money.

04:40.610 --> 04:43.477
Lesli, your job is to keep me
and my crew out ofjail.

04:43.510 --> 04:45.546
Diane, you watch over
my legit businesses.

04:45.580 --> 04:46.740
So show your value.

04:46.780 --> 04:49.578
Work together and find out
why my accountant was arrested,

04:49.620 --> 04:52.088
and whether I'll be.

04:52.120 --> 04:54.384
(door shuts)

04:55.420 --> 04:57.559
How's bankruptcy, Diane?

04:57.590 --> 05:00.491
Heard you were having
RICO troubles, Lesli.

05:00.530 --> 05:01.929
DIANE:
Will, you there?

05:01.960 --> 05:03.791
Yeah, we're here with Bishop.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.558
Alicia, dial in too.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.568
We need to get Kalinda
on this.

05:10.610 --> 05:11.907
Yeah, we're trying to get
people in on a Saturday.

05:11.940 --> 05:13.373
DIANE:
Good.

05:13.410 --> 05:14.570
It's probably the drug business,

05:14.610 --> 05:16.976
but he wants us to check for
issues on the legit side, too.

05:17.010 --> 05:18.102
The dry cleaning,

05:18.150 --> 05:19.913
the bakeries, the everything.

05:19.950 --> 05:21.042
There's also
an opportunity here.

05:21.080 --> 05:22.513
I know. I sowed some seeds.

05:22.550 --> 05:23.448
His legitimate business

05:23.490 --> 05:25.742
brings in what?
Five million a year to us?

05:25.790 --> 05:27.985
Drug business brings in 20.
Maybe more.

05:28.020 --> 05:30.580
I thought we wanted
to stay away from drugs.

05:30.630 --> 05:31.858
Ideally.

05:31.890 --> 05:33.391
But we're in a tough time.

05:33.430 --> 05:34.692
If we don't go after
Cutner & Paradini's business,

05:34.730 --> 05:36.527
they'll come after ours.
DIANE: Okay.

05:36.570 --> 05:37.696
We'll stay in touch.

05:37.730 --> 05:39.595
A possible client?

05:39.640 --> 05:40.595
Yes.

05:40.640 --> 05:41.595
A drug dealer.

05:41.640 --> 05:42.868
We've always resisted

05:42.910 --> 05:44.002
his illegal business
until now.

05:44.040 --> 05:45.530
Why?
Drugs are triclq.

05:45.570 --> 05:46.730
_ You're more
In the public eye.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.634
You're on the cops' radar.

05:48.680 --> 05:51.001
And your other clients
might leave.
No.

05:51.050 --> 05:52.677
Money respects money.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.745
Even more so in a bad economy.

05:54.780 --> 05:56.782
(phone rings)

05:57.920 --> 06:00.753
Yep. No, she's out.
What do you need, Eli?

06:00.790 --> 06:01.814
ELI:
I need a...

06:01.860 --> 06:03.657
uh, when does Diane get back?

06:03.690 --> 06:04.884
Not till tonight.
What's the problem?

06:06.930 --> 06:08.124
(sighs)

06:08.160 --> 06:09.889
I need you to call a blogger

06:09.930 --> 06:11.761
and intimidate him
with a cease-and-desist order.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.392
Cease and desist from what?

06:13.440 --> 06:14.464
Well, I...

06:14.500 --> 06:15.797
a story we don't want out.

06:15.840 --> 06:17.831
What story?

06:17.870 --> 06:20.077
Eli, I can't do it
unless you tell me the story.

06:20.110 --> 06:22.408
Well, uh...

06:22.450 --> 06:24.077
Peter slept with
a campaign worker.

06:25.110 --> 06:26.475
It's not true.

06:26.520 --> 06:29.512
And a national news magazine
decided not to print the story,

06:29.550 --> 06:33.179
but now this blogger...
Jimmy V.,

06:33.220 --> 06:35.916
wants to do a post about them
not printing the story.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.052
Okay. What's his number?

06:37.090 --> 06:38.421
Uh, hold on.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.725
Diane and Alicia are trying
to get a hold of you.

06:41.760 --> 06:42.920
All right.
I'll give them a call.

06:42.970 --> 06:44.062
(sighs)

06:44.100 --> 06:45.658
(ringing)

06:45.700 --> 06:47.565
ALICIA:
This is Alicia Florrick.
Please leave a message.

06:49.610 --> 06:50.565
(line ringing)

06:50.610 --> 06:52.601
Kalinda.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.477
I need you in this.

06:54.510 --> 06:56.705
In what?

06:56.750 --> 06:57.808
(sighs)

06:57.850 --> 06:58.999
It's the tow truck thing.

06:59.050 --> 07:02.816
This-this guy clearly doesn't
get the concept of a weekend.

07:02.850 --> 07:04.909
He's been asking about you
to try and ﬁnd out
about your vetting.

07:07.220 --> 07:08.619
Um, Cary...

07:08.660 --> 07:10.127
What?

07:12.160 --> 07:13.855
Nothing.
Let's... let's do it.

07:13.900 --> 07:16.721
Kalinda, this is Nick Saverese.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.499
Hi.
And Gavin Wells.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.064
So you're the one who vetted me.

07:21.100 --> 07:22.567
Iam.

07:22.610 --> 07:23.634
NICK:
Kalinda...

07:23.670 --> 07:24.898
May I... call you Kalinda?

07:25.940 --> 07:27.237
Of course.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.679
So, Kalinda...

07:28.710 --> 07:31.599
He wants me to split
this deal with him 50-50

07:31.650 --> 07:34.539
and I was just wondering,
well, what do you think to that?

07:34.580 --> 07:35.808
GAVIN:
It's not a deal

07:35.850 --> 07:37.112
till you win the bid.

07:37.150 --> 07:39.618
And you don't win
the government bid without me.

07:39.660 --> 07:40.854
Yeah, but...

07:40.890 --> 07:42.482
you're not doing
anything, are you?

07:42.530 --> 07:45.226
I'm putting up the trucks,
the drivers.

07:45.260 --> 07:46.921
What are you doing?

07:46.960 --> 07:47.995
Being black.

07:48.030 --> 07:49.122
(chuckles)

07:49.160 --> 07:53.233
Well, he helps you with your,
uh, your criminal past.

07:53.270 --> 07:54.897
That's what he contributes.

07:54.940 --> 07:56.191
GAVIN:
She's right.

07:56.240 --> 07:58.162
With your past
felony conviction,

07:58.210 --> 08:00.838
I'm the only reason
you're in the game

08:00.880 --> 08:02.029
bidding at all.

08:02.080 --> 08:04.708
Yeah.

08:04.750 --> 08:06.741
NICK:
Just let me see
if I got this.

08:08.820 --> 08:12.608
You think I should move
my business to Chicago

08:12.660 --> 08:14.753
and incorporate with him?

08:14.790 --> 08:15.779
(cells phone buzzes)

08:17.230 --> 08:20.028
Hi, uh...

08:20.060 --> 08:22.290
Would you just hold on one sec?

08:22.330 --> 08:24.628
Mr. Sav... Savre...

08:24.670 --> 08:25.898
Okay, just call me Nick.

08:25.930 --> 08:26.999
Nick.

08:27.040 --> 08:30.908
Um, you came to us
to vet your options,

08:30.940 --> 08:32.202
and we did.

08:32.240 --> 08:33.935
We suggested Mr. Wells,

08:33.980 --> 08:37.006
a highly respected businessman

08:37.050 --> 08:39.177
who, due to his status
as a minority-owned business

08:39.210 --> 08:42.316
offers you an advantage
in the bidding process.

08:42.350 --> 08:43.817
That's all.

08:43.850 --> 08:45.215
Beyond that, um...

08:45.250 --> 08:46.683
you can do what you want.

08:50.830 --> 08:52.821
Please excuse me.

08:53.830 --> 08:55.695
Welcome to Chicago.

08:57.230 --> 08:59.698
Now pay up.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.662
Good. I'll, uh, I'll check
with the accountant's wife,

09:01.700 --> 09:03.167
see what she knows.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.235
No, he's just being a nuisance.

09:05.270 --> 09:06.601
Oh, by the way...

09:06.640 --> 09:09.029
I didn't tell Cary
that he was my husband.

09:09.080 --> 09:11.298
It's just... complicated.

09:11.350 --> 09:12.339
Okay.

09:12.380 --> 09:14.974
I'm heading out now.

09:15.020 --> 09:17.341
So I'm being
a nuisance, am I?

09:17.390 --> 09:18.345
Yeah, you are.

09:18.390 --> 09:19.857
Who was that on the phone?

09:19.890 --> 09:21.858
Your lesbian girlfriend?

09:21.890 --> 09:22.982
(clicks tongue)

09:23.030 --> 09:24.759
Lana the lesbian Fed.

09:24.790 --> 09:26.690
Do you know they charge you
every time you come here?

09:26.730 --> 09:28.698
Cary gets $400 an hour,
and I get $175.

09:28.730 --> 09:31.699
Wouldn't it be cheaper
if you just gave me a call?

09:31.730 --> 09:33.266
So your lesbian girlfriend.

09:33.300 --> 09:35.234
She knows that you're married?

09:35.270 --> 09:36.259
She's okay with that?

09:36.300 --> 09:38.734
Nick...

09:38.770 --> 09:40.738
I have to get to work.

09:42.980 --> 09:44.004
NICK:
Come on, you know me.

09:44.050 --> 09:46.814
I-I don't mind you working.

09:46.850 --> 09:48.374
You know, I'm-I'm
open-minded that way,

09:48.420 --> 09:50.217
but... I don't know.

09:50.250 --> 09:53.378
I do mind you sleeping
with other women.

09:53.420 --> 09:55.615
I mean, call me old-fashioned.

09:57.290 --> 09:58.621
You're such an idiot.

09:58.660 --> 10:01.049
That wasn't even Lana
on the phone.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.920
It was work.

10:02.970 --> 10:07.088
Your voice on that phone
was not work.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.904
Kalinda.

10:14.980 --> 10:17.278
Everything all right?

10:17.310 --> 10:18.299
Yeah.

10:18.350 --> 10:20.113
Yeah, it is. Sorry.

10:20.150 --> 10:22.277
We're just having
a bit of a disagreement.

10:22.320 --> 10:25.881
Kalinda here says that
you're $400 an hour,

10:25.920 --> 10:27.649
and I say you're $450.

10:27.690 --> 10:28.759
And, uh, I don't know.

10:28.790 --> 10:30.883
Which one is it?

10:30.930 --> 10:32.659
I don't know.
I don't read the bills.

10:32.700 --> 10:33.792
(sighs)

10:33.830 --> 10:34.956
Kalinda, you good?

10:36.000 --> 10:37.399
We're okay.

10:37.430 --> 10:39.421
I'm gonna head out now,
so I'll see you later.

10:39.470 --> 10:41.438
Bye.

10:41.470 --> 10:42.664
Yeah, see you.

10:44.710 --> 10:45.802
NICK:
You know what?

10:45.840 --> 10:47.034
She's convinced me.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.776
Let's sign that contract
with the black guy.

10:49.810 --> 10:50.777
(phone ringing)

10:50.810 --> 10:52.812
Speak.

10:54.020 --> 10:54.975
What? You're kidding.

10:55.020 --> 10:56.783
I'm afraid not, Mr. V.

10:56.820 --> 10:57.718
It's called "defamation."

10:57.750 --> 10:59.217
And you defame our client,
Peter Florrick,

10:59.250 --> 11:00.683
and we're more than ready
to sue.

11:00.720 --> 11:03.985
So, what do I need to do?

11:04.030 --> 11:08.194
Don't post. If you do, we're
gonna sue you for $3 million.

11:08.230 --> 11:09.720
But it's true,
the story was written,

11:09.770 --> 11:10.862
and they're not gonna print it.

11:10.900 --> 11:12.390
You don't know that, Mr. V.

11:12.430 --> 11:14.796
All you know is what
was said to you.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.068
And since you've done
no fact-checking,

11:16.100 --> 11:17.260
you're open to a suit.

11:17.310 --> 11:19.198
Okay. Send me the
cease-and-desist order,

11:19.240 --> 11:20.172
and I won't post.

11:20.210 --> 11:22.405
You post, and you lose
everything you own.

11:22.440 --> 11:24.305
I know. Send me
the cease-and-desist.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.114
Eli, he's playing you.

11:35.160 --> 11:36.821
He's gonna print it either way.

11:36.860 --> 11:39.078
I talked to Mrs. Stiglitz,
your accountant's wife.

11:39.130 --> 11:40.222
The feds had a search warrant,

11:40.260 --> 11:42.820
and they took all of his
accounting files from his home.

11:42.870 --> 11:43.962
LESLI:
It's okay. I'll see

11:44.000 --> 11:45.365
if anyone on your crew
is talking.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.288
The feds don't just get it
in their heads like that

11:47.340 --> 11:48.432
to go digging.

11:48.470 --> 11:50.233
It's not about
your drug busmess.

11:50.270 --> 11:51.806
It's about your
legit businesses.

11:53.140 --> 11:56.177
Oh, that's interesting.

11:56.210 --> 11:57.848
They took all files from all 20
of your legit businesses

11:57.880 --> 11:59.939
so we don't know
which one IS a target.

11:59.980 --> 12:01.777
So, Diane, do you need help

12:01.820 --> 12:03.117
going through
your legal work?

12:03.150 --> 12:04.788
LEMOND:
Stop it.

12:04.820 --> 12:07.015
My guess is they're looking
at some small oversight

12:07.060 --> 12:09.858
in one of my gas stations
or health clubs to arrest me.

12:09.890 --> 12:11.323
Find out what.

12:11.360 --> 12:13.123
And I want you.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.195
Yes.

12:17.230 --> 12:19.494
I want you here
when the cops come.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.259
I don't want my son scared.

12:21.300 --> 12:24.463
And I don't want some accident
to befall me during the arrest.

12:24.510 --> 12:26.774
Uh, that won't happen,
Mr. Bishop.

12:26.810 --> 12:28.004
Excuse me.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.905
That will happen.

12:37.050 --> 12:38.915
Are you okay staying?

12:38.950 --> 12:42.158
Yes. I mean,
if it goes longer,

12:42.190 --> 12:43.555
I'll need to make
some arrangements.

12:43.590 --> 12:44.921
It shouldn't.

12:44.960 --> 12:46.188
If he's arrested,
it'll happen soon.

12:46.230 --> 12:48.391
It's because I'm Peter's wife?

12:48.430 --> 12:49.556
That's why he wants me?

12:49.600 --> 12:52.319
Yes. There's no
better babysitter

12:52.370 --> 12:53.928
for a kingpin than...

12:53.970 --> 12:55.369
...the State's Attorney's wife.

12:55.400 --> 12:59.905
Yes.

12:59.940 --> 13:01.931
Well, here goes.

13:27.900 --> 13:30.334
And, uh, Hardy Time Liquor?

13:30.370 --> 13:34.033
That's Darren.
Darren Holts, manager.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.399
Any worries there?

13:35.440 --> 13:37.305
Any financial
irregularities?

13:37.350 --> 13:38.374
No.

13:38.410 --> 13:39.240
You trust him?

13:39.280 --> 13:41.441
Enough not to turn on me.

13:41.480 --> 13:44.119
But, um, could he get
into any legal trouble

13:44.150 --> 13:45.515
that might lead back to you?

13:45.550 --> 13:46.539
I don't know.

13:46.590 --> 13:49.286
I'm CEO. I delegate.

13:49.320 --> 13:51.254
I tried to control
everything,

13:51.290 --> 13:54.157
but six months ago
I ended up in Chapter 11.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.599
DYLAN:
Dad! Dad!
Guess what?

13:55.630 --> 13:57.268
Hey, Dylan.
This is Mrs. Florrick.

13:57.300 --> 13:59.188
She works with Daddy.

13:59.230 --> 14:01.289
So, did you break any bricks
with your forehead?

14:01.340 --> 14:02.932
No, but I talked
to Damian.

14:02.970 --> 14:04.528
He said he could come.
Really?

14:04.570 --> 14:05.559
(cell phone rings)

14:05.610 --> 14:08.204
Oh, would you
excuse me? Yes?

14:08.240 --> 14:09.605
PETER:
Hey, It's me.

14:09.640 --> 14:12.006
I'm sorry I had
to run out on you.

14:12.050 --> 14:13.176
How's it going?

14:13.220 --> 14:15.916
Good, fine. Eli thinks we'll
beat the expectations here.

14:15.950 --> 14:18.043
which is, I guess,
what it's all about.

14:18.090 --> 14:20.456
Good.

14:20.490 --> 14:23.618
Yes, but we are running
into a problem on the article.

14:23.660 --> 14:25.355
Nothing yet.

14:25.390 --> 14:27.654
Believe it or not,
there is a blog

14:27.700 --> 14:29.998
that wants to print a story
on the magazine

14:30.030 --> 14:31.918
for not running.
It's a backdoor way

14:31.970 --> 14:33.369
for the reporter
to get her story out.

14:33.400 --> 14:35.459
She leaks it to a blog,

14:35.500 --> 14:36.535
the blogger embarrasses
the magazine,

14:36.570 --> 14:39.209
then the magazine ends up
printing it, you know,

14:39.240 --> 14:40.207
the circle of life.

14:40.240 --> 14:41.468
Well, it was bound to happen.

14:41.510 --> 14:43.944
You sound okay.

14:43.980 --> 14:46.107
I do. I'm just... resigned.

14:47.650 --> 14:51.245
Well, I guess I'll call the kids
and tell them.

14:51.290 --> 14:54.350
Oh, right, the kids.
Thanks. I...

14:54.390 --> 14:56.312
Hey, we're gonna get
through this, okay?

14:56.360 --> 14:58.225
Okay. Gotta go.

14:58.260 --> 15:00.399
Talk to you later.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.698
Would you like to do this
later, Mr. Bishop?

15:08.740 --> 15:14.007
His eighth birthday party,
and no one's coming.

15:14.040 --> 15:16.008
Parents of his
fnends

15:16.040 --> 15:18.099
don't want them
around me.

15:18.150 --> 15:20.345
And my son just
thinks I'm his...

15:20.380 --> 15:23.986
great dad.

15:24.020 --> 15:25.487
I'm sorry. That's hard.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.409
Check Dex.

15:29.460 --> 15:31.428
Dexter Roja.
I moved him from one

15:31.460 --> 15:33.155
_ of the crews
Into management.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.599
Might've been premature.

15:34.630 --> 15:38.020
Do you know how many
of the businesses he managed?

15:38.070 --> 15:39.662
Six.

15:39.700 --> 15:43.306
All right, these are the six
businesses managed by Roja.

15:43.340 --> 15:44.500
Good. What'd
you find?
Nothing.

15:44.540 --> 15:45.962
But we'll need a week
with these.

15:46.010 --> 15:47.375
They're an accounting nightmare.

15:47.410 --> 15:49.139
Well, the cops have
the same thing,

15:49.180 --> 15:51.307
so if we can't find it,
they can't.

15:51.350 --> 15:54.069
Check the footnotes.

15:55.780 --> 15:58.044
That's where accountants dispose
of problems.

15:58.090 --> 16:01.389
You seem to speak
from experience, Mr. Hayden.

16:01.420 --> 16:03.559
22 years as a CPA.

16:03.590 --> 16:05.421
Where does an accountant
put hIs mIstakes?

16:05.460 --> 16:06.552
I don't know. Where?

16:06.590 --> 16:08.558
In the footnotes.

16:09.700 --> 16:11.497
Oh. I thought that was a joke.

16:11.530 --> 16:12.758
Why would I joke?

16:12.800 --> 16:16.065
Well, you said it the...

16:16.100 --> 16:18.136
Okay, Cary,
check the footnotes.

16:22.340 --> 16:23.671
Do you mind helping?

16:27.350 --> 16:28.476
I...

16:29.620 --> 16:32.783
Sure.

16:32.820 --> 16:35.186
(crowd cheering)

16:35.220 --> 16:37.450
So what do you call a win, Eli?

16:37.490 --> 16:39.720
Uh, the majority of
the straw poll votes.

16:39.760 --> 16:43.196
Oh, come on. You guys
have this hands-down.

16:43.230 --> 16:45.289
I'm hearing you need
95% of the vote

16:45.330 --> 16:47.434
to keep the other two Democrats
from being contenders.

16:47.470 --> 16:49.631
Oh, my God, only
the mainstream media

16:49.670 --> 16:53.037
would take a 90% landslide
and call it a loss.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.604
Oh, that's what
we're expecting?

16:54.640 --> 16:55.732
A 90% landslide?

16:55.780 --> 16:59.341
MAN (over P.A.):
Please remember to cast
your ballot.

16:59.380 --> 17:01.348
The poll remains open
until 8:00.

17:01.380 --> 17:03.382
Huh? Um,
I'll be right back, Harv.

17:05.550 --> 17:08.212
What are you standing
there for?

17:08.260 --> 17:10.421
Peter, can we talk?

17:10.460 --> 17:11.722
Yeah, excuse me.

17:11.760 --> 17:13.091
Of course.

17:13.130 --> 17:15.758
It's up.

17:15.800 --> 17:16.596
How long?

17:18.530 --> 17:20.794
the blogger sent out
e-mail alerts to all of them.

17:20.840 --> 17:22.091
Maybe half an hour.

17:22.140 --> 17:23.505
We've got to get
our spin straight.

17:23.540 --> 17:26.134
Ouch.
Now what?

17:26.170 --> 17:29.537
He mentions the cease-and-desist
call from Will.

17:29.580 --> 17:31.207
VVho?

17:32.350 --> 17:34.113
I couldn't couldn't
get a hold of Dane,

17:34.150 --> 17:35.777
and I needed
to intimidate him right away.

17:35.820 --> 17:36.912
You had...

17:36.950 --> 17:39.714
you had Will Gardner send
a cease-and-desist order?

17:39.750 --> 17:42.116
No. Because the blogger was
going ahead no matter what,

17:42.160 --> 17:43.650
so we pulled back.
Excuse me.

17:43.690 --> 17:44.782
Don't do that, Eli.

17:44.830 --> 17:47.196
Don't have Will do
anything for me.

17:47.230 --> 17:49.152
It was an emergency.
I understand.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.519
Just don't get
him involved.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.459
You're right. I'm sorry.

17:54.600 --> 17:58.400
So we'll spin this
as an attempt to smear you.

17:58.440 --> 18:01.432
We'll make it a process story
about how we address a smear.

18:01.480 --> 18:02.879
No, no. Just let it go.

18:02.910 --> 18:05.708
Don't even dignify it with spin.

18:05.750 --> 18:07.741
These things die on their own.

18:07.780 --> 18:09.441
You accusing me
of skimming?

18:09.480 --> 18:11.209
No, no. It's just
that there is

18:11.250 --> 18:12.182
a discrepancy
in the books,

18:12.220 --> 18:14.484
and Mr. Bishop asked us
to check in with you

18:14.520 --> 18:17.284
because you're the manager
of his bakery business.

18:17.330 --> 18:18.479
Show me.

18:18.530 --> 18:20.293
Show me the discrepancy
in the books.

18:20.330 --> 18:21.888
Show him.

18:21.930 --> 18:24.569
Here, this footnote.

18:24.600 --> 18:25.498
There's a 12% bump

18:25.530 --> 18:27.532
in sales in the first quarter
of this year.

18:27.570 --> 18:30.164
We sell to the coffee chains.
They expanded.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.508
Yes, but if you look here, there
was no corresponding rise

18:32.540 --> 18:35.703
in the purchase of flour
or high-fructose corn syrup.

18:35.740 --> 18:37.776
So if you were distributing
more units,

18:37.810 --> 18:40.711
your raw materials' costs should
be correspondingly higher.

18:40.750 --> 18:42.411
We bought 'em last quarter

18:42.450 --> 18:45.510
to hedge against
the commodity prices.

18:45.550 --> 18:47.654
No. Not according
to this spreadsheet

18:47.690 --> 18:49.157
comparing
year-to-year purchases.

18:50.290 --> 18:51.621
Who are you again?

18:51.660 --> 18:52.558
Clarke Hayden.

18:52.590 --> 18:54.797
I work as a trustee
at Lockhart/Gardner.

18:54.830 --> 18:57.560
If you'll look here in
this footnote, you'll see

18:57.600 --> 19:00.194
_ there is no increase
In the yearly profIts eIther.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.730
So I have to ask
you, Sll‘,

19:01.770 --> 19:05.365
if you had a 12% rise,
where did the surplus go?

19:07.480 --> 19:08.879
Employee benefits.

19:08.910 --> 19:10.707
What employee benefits?

19:10.750 --> 19:15.175
We bought all the employees
memberships to a health club.

19:19.820 --> 19:21.617
So you're also owned
by Lemond Bishop?

19:21.660 --> 19:24.925
Oh, yeah, but he pretty much
lets us do what we want.

19:24.960 --> 19:25.927
And you seemed
to have had an increase

19:25.960 --> 19:28.599
in health club memberships
in the first quarter.

19:28.630 --> 19:30.427
You usually have 40
to 60 new members.

19:30.470 --> 19:31.926
And this year,
you had 300.

19:31.970 --> 19:33.335
Yes, we were thrilled.

19:33.370 --> 19:34.928
Right, but what
we're finding odd

19:34.970 --> 19:36.767
is that you've only had 30
of the new members

19:36.800 --> 19:38.301
use the facilities.

19:38.340 --> 19:40.774
Well, here's the secret
about health clubs.

19:40.810 --> 19:43.244
Most members like the idea
of a health club,

19:43.280 --> 19:44.872
but they don't
love using it.

19:44.910 --> 19:48.914
But 270 members never
showed up, even once.

19:48.950 --> 19:49.917
Really?
Yeah.

19:49.950 --> 19:52.339
Look. See this
footnote here?

19:52.390 --> 19:54.858
What?

19:54.890 --> 19:56.482
Mr. Hayden, what is it?

19:56.520 --> 19:57.885
People think
they can hide.

19:57.930 --> 20:01.297
You know the wondrous thing
about numbers?

20:01.330 --> 20:03.969
You can't hide.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.389
How dare you?

20:06.430 --> 20:08.569
You're laundering money
through our legit businesses?

20:08.600 --> 20:12.536
It's not your legit business.
It's Bishop's.

20:12.570 --> 20:13.730
And we're his caretakers.

20:13.780 --> 20:14.974
You're compromising
our legit businesses,

20:15.010 --> 20:16.204
and you're not telling us.

20:16.240 --> 20:18.777
Your_ businesses wouldn't even
eXIst WIthout our busmess.

20:18.810 --> 20:20.516
How do you think
they're staying afloat?

20:20.550 --> 20:21.847
With drug money.

20:21.880 --> 20:23.245
I don't know
what's more startling:

20:23.290 --> 20:24.609
your sanctimony
or your hypocrisy.

20:24.650 --> 20:26.379
You had
a bigger problem, Diane.

20:26.420 --> 20:27.751
Your accountant just found
a discrepancy

20:27.790 --> 20:29.314
in the health club juice bar,

20:29.360 --> 20:31.624
and we have nothing
to do with that.

20:31.660 --> 20:34.697
There's nothing wrong
with the juice bar.

20:34.730 --> 20:36.288
Except that it's closed
and it's still making money.

20:36.330 --> 20:38.798
According to who?

20:38.830 --> 20:40.491
An accountant
at our ﬁrm.

20:40.540 --> 20:42.360
Well, he's wrong.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.630
It's just the health club
making money.

20:44.670 --> 20:45.830
Stop lying, Dex.

20:45.870 --> 20:47.770
I put you in charge
of this place.

20:47.810 --> 20:48.970
You need to explain.

20:50.480 --> 20:51.708
Look, when we lost

20:51.750 --> 20:53.570
the other two health clubs,

20:53.620 --> 20:57.841
you said to be entrepreneurial,
self-starters.

20:57.890 --> 20:59.710
I was trying something.

20:59.750 --> 21:02.583
What?

21:02.620 --> 21:04.326
HGH.

21:06.490 --> 21:09.755
I told you no drugs!
Not on the legit side!

21:09.800 --> 21:11.062
But it's not drugs.
It's steroids!

21:11.100 --> 21:13.295
Look, I was clearing
$120,000 a month.

21:13.340 --> 21:15.535
The health club was
gonna go under without it.

21:15.570 --> 21:17.435
(cell phone rings)

21:17.470 --> 21:18.505
Yeah. Everything all right?

21:18.540 --> 21:22.431
No. There's some activity
at the end of his block.

21:22.480 --> 21:23.344
What do you mean?

21:23.380 --> 21:25.348
It's a cable TV van.
Looks like undercover.

21:25.380 --> 21:27.644
Trying very hard
not to look like undercover.

21:27.680 --> 21:28.840
Okay, hang on.

21:28.880 --> 21:31.644
Hi. Excuse me!

21:31.690 --> 21:33.555
Yes?
I'm so glad
you made it.

21:33.590 --> 21:35.410
I just live right there.
Come on up.

21:35.460 --> 21:36.882
Actually, ma'am,
we're not here for you.

21:36.920 --> 21:38.581
I'm sorry.
What do you mean

21:38.630 --> 21:40.621
you're not here for me?
I called you guys.

21:40.660 --> 21:41.649
You said you were coming.

21:41.700 --> 21:43.565
My wire is sparking
really badly. It's dangerous.

21:43.600 --> 21:45.022
Sorry, ma'am.
We're here on another call.

21:45.070 --> 21:46.469
Yeah? Which house?

21:46.500 --> 21:47.762
What house was
the call from?

21:47.800 --> 21:49.358
Yeah.
That's private,
ma'am.

21:49.400 --> 21:51.504
It's private which house
you're going to? Why is that?

21:51.540 --> 21:52.939
Because_our work
Is coandentIal.

21:52.970 --> 21:54.801
Cable TV work
is confidential?

21:54.840 --> 21:56.831
KaHnda!
Let the man do his work.

21:59.810 --> 22:03.109
Oh, Lana, still on
the Lemond Bishop track?

22:03.150 --> 22:06.039
Mm-hmm. You still working
for drug dealers and pimps?

22:06.090 --> 22:07.512
Yeah, and child pornographers.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.778
Is that him there
on the phone?

22:09.820 --> 22:11.788
Good old Lemond Bishop?

22:11.830 --> 22:13.058
No, it's my mother.

22:13.090 --> 22:14.421
Hi, Mom.

22:14.460 --> 22:15.791
It's not the cops.
It's the feds.

22:15.830 --> 22:17.491
And it's not an arrest.
It's a search warrant.

22:17.530 --> 22:18.667
I just know how you love

22:18.700 --> 22:20.065
to know these things.

22:20.100 --> 22:21.795
Love you.
Move now.

22:21.840 --> 22:22.864
Move in now.

22:22.900 --> 22:23.867
Go.

22:23.910 --> 22:25.059
How far off are they?

22:25.110 --> 22:26.361
Seconds away.

22:26.410 --> 22:27.502
You going to tell him?

22:27.540 --> 22:28.802
I don't know.

22:28.840 --> 22:30.546
He'll destroy
whatever they're after.

22:30.580 --> 22:32.548
I know.

22:37.450 --> 22:39.486
What? What was that?

22:41.590 --> 22:43.888
They're coming
with a search warrant now.

22:44.930 --> 22:46.079
How far?

22:46.130 --> 22:47.495
Down the block now.

22:48.530 --> 22:50.088
We messaged
on the game box.

22:50.130 --> 22:51.688
What about other
VIdeo games?

22:51.730 --> 22:52.765
Just the one.

22:52.800 --> 22:53.767
Okay, go get it.

22:53.800 --> 22:54.789
It's in Dylan's room.

22:57.740 --> 22:59.503
Dad?

23:03.780 --> 23:06.499
Mrs. Florrick,
could you help with Dylan?

23:06.550 --> 23:08.438
(knocking)

23:08.480 --> 23:09.845
MAN (from outside):
This is a federal warrant!

23:09.880 --> 23:11.848
Open the door
or be subject to arrest!

23:11.890 --> 23:13.687
(knocking continues)

23:13.720 --> 23:15.711
(knocking):
Open the door!

23:22.000 --> 23:27.165
(knocking, indistinct shouting
in distance)

23:27.200 --> 23:29.532
They should be gone soon.

23:29.570 --> 23:33.165
Did my dad do
something bad?

23:33.210 --> 23:35.906
He says he didn't.

23:35.940 --> 23:38.647
The kids talk
about him at school.

23:38.680 --> 23:40.978
Be sure to check the
furnace room and the cellar.

23:43.790 --> 23:45.542
Your dad says you go to camp.

23:45.590 --> 23:47.148
What kind of camp is it?

23:47.190 --> 23:48.714
Basketball camp.

23:48.760 --> 23:51.558
(clattering)

23:52.560 --> 23:54.198
Are you a Bulls fan?

23:54.230 --> 23:56.050
Yeah.

23:56.100 --> 23:58.091
I was there when they won
their second championship.

23:58.130 --> 23:59.666
You saw Michael Jordan?

23:59.700 --> 24:00.564
Yep.

24:00.600 --> 24:02.761
My husband took me there
on our first date.

24:02.800 --> 24:04.961
The only problem was...

24:05.010 --> 24:07.069
I knew nothing about basketball,

24:07.110 --> 24:09.237
and I had no idea
what was going on.

24:09.280 --> 24:10.941
(both laughing)

24:12.510 --> 24:14.649
(indistinct chattering
in distance)

24:14.680 --> 24:16.568
Don't suppose you could
tell us what this is about.

24:16.620 --> 24:18.918
We can point you in
the right direction.

24:18.950 --> 24:19.939
Sorry, Ms. Lockhart.

24:19.990 --> 24:20.911
The underlying complaint
is sealed.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.258
If you have a problem,
take it up with a judge.

24:23.290 --> 24:24.928
The game box--
it's missing.

24:24.960 --> 24:26.655
Thanks, Kalinda.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.258
I did a head count.

24:29.300 --> 24:30.927
All the agents are FBI.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.222
Not a single one of them
is from the DEA.

24:33.270 --> 24:35.033
Which means
this isn't about HGH.

24:35.070 --> 24:37.504
If it were about steroids,
there would be a DEA.

24:37.540 --> 24:38.734
The feds
are giving us nothing

24:38.770 --> 24:39.964
on the basis
for this warrant.

24:40.010 --> 24:41.238
LESLI: The warrant
will only be unsealed

24:41.280 --> 24:44.147
if they arrest Lemond, and then
it'll be too late to help him.

24:44.180 --> 24:46.501
Doesn't have to be Mr. Bishop
who's arrested.

24:47.580 --> 24:48.979
Legally, any...

24:50.220 --> 24:51.778
...any arrest in connection
with this search

24:51.820 --> 24:53.549
would be grounds
to unseal the warrant.

24:53.590 --> 24:55.251
Such as_someone
obstructIng justIce

24:55.290 --> 24:57.258
by interfering
with the search?

24:59.590 --> 25:02.127
I have my ballet class tonight.

25:06.730 --> 25:09.267
(chuckles)

25:09.300 --> 25:11.234
(horn honks)

25:13.040 --> 25:14.735
You're looking
determined.

25:14.780 --> 25:15.872
I'm here because

25:15.910 --> 25:17.605
your people
filed a Franks motion

25:17.650 --> 25:19.140
to unseal the search warrant.
Yes,

25:19.180 --> 25:20.909
I heard, but you usually

25:20.950 --> 25:22.838
have more of a sense of humor
about these thIngs.

25:22.880 --> 25:24.142
I'm generally
not all that smiley

25:24.190 --> 25:25.589
when my apartment is sealed off

25:25.620 --> 25:27.110
and I have to crash
at my SIster's.

25:27.150 --> 25:28.651
What?
My apartment

25:28.690 --> 25:30.578
was ransacked
a few hours ago.

25:30.630 --> 25:34.623
You should remind
your ﬁne, upstandIng c|Ient,

25:34.660 --> 25:36.855
Mr. Bishop,
that breaking and entering

25:36.900 --> 25:38.891
is a crime.

25:40.840 --> 25:43.559
How do you know it was Bishop?

25:43.610 --> 25:44.861
Nothing was taken.

25:44.910 --> 25:47.629
No cash, no jewelry,
no electronics.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.033
They just tossed
the place.

25:49.080 --> 25:50.877
If he was trying
to scare me,

25:50.910 --> 25:52.207
tell him
it didn't work.

25:55.080 --> 25:56.308
Anything else?

25:56.350 --> 25:58.545
No, I'm just glad you're okay.

25:59.790 --> 26:01.758
Thanks for the reassurance.

26:02.820 --> 26:05.220
DIANE:
The arrest of Mr. Agos

26:05.260 --> 26:07.899
was made during the search,
Your Honor.

26:07.930 --> 26:09.056
Under the_ Franks
doctrIne,

26:09.100 --> 26:11.193
that is grounds
to unseal the warrant...
LANA: The arrest

26:11.230 --> 26:12.720
was of one
of Mr. Bishop's attorneys

26:12.770 --> 26:14.897
who was not a target
of the_ search.
But It was

26:14.940 --> 26:15.838
still an arrest.
And Mr. Agos

26:15.870 --> 26:17.337
was released immediately.

26:17.370 --> 26:20.100
(typing)

26:21.710 --> 26:22.278
Your Honor?

26:23.340 --> 26:25.945
Oh, I'm here. I just need
these sell orders ready

26:25.980 --> 26:27.106
when the market opens Monday.

26:27.150 --> 26:29.209
You can't properly
represent your client

26:29.250 --> 26:30.945
without knowing
what the warrant was about,

26:30.990 --> 26:32.014
and Agent Delaney thinks

26:32.050 --> 26:34.712
that Franks doesn't apply
because the man arrested

26:34.760 --> 26:36.159
had no connection
to the warrant.

26:36.190 --> 26:37.782
'Kay. Continue.

26:37.830 --> 26:39.320
Mr. Agos's Fourth Amendment
rights

26:39.360 --> 26:40.998
against illegal
search and seizure

26:41.030 --> 26:43.248
are being egregiously violated.
The warrant

26:43.300 --> 26:46.394
is sealed because
Mr. Bishop is a public threat.

26:46.430 --> 26:48.068
All right. I get it.

26:48.100 --> 26:50.159
What we have_ here
Is a legal tIe,

26:50.200 --> 26:52.634
and ties always go
to the runner. Agent Delaney,

26:52.670 --> 26:54.069
I am ordering the
warrant unsealed.

26:54.110 --> 26:55.873
Tell them what
they want to know.

26:56.980 --> 26:58.277
A confidential informant?

26:58.310 --> 26:59.709
LESLI:
The warrant

26:59.750 --> 27:02.719
refers to him or her
simply as "CI. 691."

27:02.750 --> 27:05.184
Whoever it is has been
missing for 72 hours.

27:06.290 --> 27:07.780
ALICIA:
The feds were searching
your house

27:07.820 --> 27:09.685
for evidence of this
informant's whereabouts.

27:09.720 --> 27:13.929
The good news is that whatever
this informant told the FBI,

27:13.960 --> 27:15.848
it's not enough
to charge you.

27:15.900 --> 27:19.028
We just need to figure out
who it is and fast.

27:21.070 --> 27:22.958
I need your cell phone.

I need to call Dex.

27:35.750 --> 27:37.377
Oh, crap.

27:37.420 --> 27:39.684
Hey, we're doing great.
We got volunteers everywhere.

27:39.720 --> 27:41.859
No, no, no, no.
It's not that. Look.

27:42.890 --> 27:44.255
He's found a way

27:44.290 --> 27:46.349
to make it go viral.

27:46.390 --> 27:47.926
That's... Indira Starr?

27:47.960 --> 27:50.895
No. That is a photoshopped
Indira Starr.

27:50.930 --> 27:53.296
And if there's one thing
the mainstream media likes,

27:53.330 --> 27:54.831
it's a visual.

27:56.140 --> 27:58.233
(sighs)
Look.

28:00.110 --> 28:01.429
Damn it!

28:08.350 --> 28:10.739
You broke into
her apartment?

28:10.790 --> 28:11.916
Whose apartment?

28:11.950 --> 28:12.882
Lana Delaney.

28:12.920 --> 28:14.478
You broke into
a federal agent's apartment?

28:14.520 --> 28:16.408
Hang on a minute.
Take a breather.

28:16.460 --> 28:18.121
You know I don't do things
like that anymore.

28:18.160 --> 28:20.458
I'm a changed man.

28:20.490 --> 28:21.821
What are you doing?

28:21.860 --> 28:24.397
Hi, my name is Kalinda Sharma,

28:24.430 --> 28:27.934
and I'm at 10497 North Damen
Avenue, apartment 3B.

28:27.970 --> 28:29.892
I think there's been a break-in.

28:30.970 --> 28:33.200
No, but I haven't checked
the bedroom yet.

28:33.240 --> 28:35.174
Would you please send someone?

28:35.210 --> 28:37.508
All right, thanks,
and hurry up, please.

28:37.540 --> 28:39.804
Tell 'em you made a mistake.

28:40.850 --> 28:42.249
You have 15 minutes.

28:42.280 --> 28:43.941
No.

28:43.990 --> 28:45.719
You have 15 minutes.

28:46.520 --> 28:47.919
Oh, my God, I think

28:47.960 --> 28:49.951
I just heard a noise
in the bedroom.

28:52.060 --> 28:53.459
(grunts)

28:57.970 --> 28:59.528
(lips sputter)

28:59.570 --> 29:01.265
Well, lookie here.

29:04.110 --> 29:06.066
I think you definitely
got termites.

29:06.110 --> 29:08.408
My mistake.
It was my husband.

29:08.440 --> 29:10.772
No, I'm fine. Thanks.

29:10.810 --> 29:12.107
The problem is...

29:12.150 --> 29:14.175
okay".

29:14.220 --> 29:16.211
I only found $10,000.

29:17.580 --> 29:20.287
Where's the rest... "honey"?

29:22.960 --> 29:25.326
I can't have you disrupting
my life like this.

29:25.360 --> 29:27.487
"Disrupting your |ife"--
is that what I'm doing?

29:28.860 --> 29:31.499
So, wh-what do you call
what you've done to me?

29:31.530 --> 29:33.839
I haven't done anything to you.

29:33.870 --> 29:36.862
You made me love you!

29:40.110 --> 29:43.204
I can't love anyone else,
all right?

29:43.240 --> 29:44.377
I've tried.

29:44.410 --> 29:47.106
You are in my head.

29:54.420 --> 29:57.014
Nick.

29:57.060 --> 29:58.527
Nick.

29:58.560 --> 30:00.187
Look, I'm not the same.

30:00.230 --> 30:02.994
You can see that.

30:03.030 --> 30:05.294
You...

30:05.330 --> 30:07.935
You want me to be what I was.

30:16.010 --> 30:18.808
Your girlfriend's out
to screw you.

30:21.420 --> 30:23.479
I was in her apartment.

30:26.550 --> 30:28.609
For you.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.355
Not for me.

30:30.390 --> 30:33.382
She's got photos
of you everywhere.

30:35.660 --> 30:37.150
What photos?

30:46.910 --> 30:47.934
That's you there.

30:47.980 --> 30:49.470
I don't know
who that is, but...

30:49.510 --> 30:52.104
she's got these
everywhere.

30:53.150 --> 30:55.516
You need _to know
who your frIends are.

30:55.550 --> 30:59.111
This... lesbian Fed
is not your friend.

30:59.150 --> 31:03.018
Okay, and you got to stop
thinking down here.

31:14.540 --> 31:17.498
(whispers):
Get off of me.
Don't...

31:19.540 --> 31:20.939
(door opens)

31:20.980 --> 31:21.878
(door shuts)

31:25.680 --> 31:27.170
They're looking
for a missing C.I.?

31:27.210 --> 31:28.347
BISHOP:
Yeah. That's how
the feds got

31:28.380 --> 31:30.371
their search warrant.
KALINDA:
And we think that's why

31:30.420 --> 31:31.341
they arrested
the accountant.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.346
They were shaking
every tree.

31:33.390 --> 31:34.948
They're coming after me.

31:34.990 --> 31:36.287
They're building their case.

31:36.320 --> 31:37.457
Dexter,

31:37.490 --> 31:38.980
are there any employees

31:39.030 --> 31:41.248
you haven't seen
over the last few days?

31:41.300 --> 31:42.995
Someone who could
be the informant?

31:43.030 --> 31:46.158
Maybe someone who didn't
turn up to work?

31:46.200 --> 31:48.134
Okay.

31:48.170 --> 31:48.989
That's not good.

31:49.040 --> 31:51.008
Christina Diaz.

31:51.040 --> 31:53.235
She works at Fine Fitness
on the front desk.

31:53.270 --> 31:54.339
Damn it.
If the feds

31:54.380 --> 31:57.008
ever questioned her,
could that cause you trouble?

31:57.040 --> 31:58.371
Possibly.

31:58.410 --> 32:00.002
(sighing):
Okay.

32:00.050 --> 32:03.941
I think we just identified
our missing C.I.

32:03.990 --> 32:06.288
MAN:
Come on, Eli. Give me something.

32:06.320 --> 32:09.414
Only statement we have is
that there is no story here.

32:09.460 --> 32:11.348
PETER:
Here's what I want
for Illinois.

32:11.390 --> 32:15.429
I_ want an Illinois that doesn't
just thInk In terms of Cook...
ELI: Oh.

32:15.460 --> 32:17.655
Come on. When did
the mainstream media

32:17.700 --> 32:21.591
start sucking up to bloggers?
MADDIE:
Hi, Eli.

32:22.600 --> 32:23.737
Troubles?
No,

32:23.770 --> 32:25.101
just the normal course
of business.

32:25.140 --> 32:27.199
I hear we might
get our 95%.

32:27.240 --> 32:29.731
Beat the whole straw poll
expectations game.

32:29.780 --> 32:31.702
PETER:
...access to
better healthcare.

32:31.750 --> 32:33.377
And we need
Here comes the line.

32:33.410 --> 32:35.617
to protect a woman's
right to choose.

32:35.650 --> 32:36.719
(cheering and applause)

32:36.750 --> 32:38.183
Not bad, huh?

32:38.220 --> 32:39.187
I saw it, Eli.

32:39.220 --> 32:40.118
Saw what?

32:45.190 --> 32:46.259
I'm gonna call you back.

32:46.290 --> 32:47.086
My friends are

32:47.130 --> 32:48.051
asking me what I think,

32:48.100 --> 32:50.091
which puts me
in a very awkward position.

32:50.130 --> 32:51.620
It's all smoke.

32:51.670 --> 32:55.595
The story was killed because
we proved Indira Starr lied.

32:55.640 --> 32:56.732
There's physical
evidence.

32:56.770 --> 32:58.499
_ I _can call our
InvestIgator over here

32:58.540 --> 33:01.407
to lay it all out for you.
My friends don't
like this stuff.

33:01.440 --> 33:02.236
They can swallow the fact

33:02.280 --> 33:03.770
that there are no women
In the race,

33:03.810 --> 33:05.675
but this just rubs it
in their face.
Well,

33:05.710 --> 33:07.769
I can assure...

33:07.810 --> 33:10.313
yourfnends”.

33:10.350 --> 33:12.079
that it is a lie.

33:12.120 --> 33:14.054
PETER:
I want an Illinois
where every CItIzen,

33:14.090 --> 33:15.011
man and woman,

33:15.060 --> 33:17.711
young and old,
can realize their dreams...

33:17.760 --> 33:20.285
What else does
Christina know?

33:20.330 --> 33:22.355
She knows
about the HGH.

33:22.400 --> 33:23.719
ALICIA: She was
helpIng you sell?

33:23.760 --> 33:25.318
Yeah.
Did you talk
with her

33:25.370 --> 33:27.292
about any other part
of Mr. Bishop's business?

33:27.330 --> 33:29.036
I would never do that.
But you

33:29.070 --> 33:32.107
trusted her enough
to run your HGH.

33:32.140 --> 33:33.630
Yeah. She was discreet.

33:33.670 --> 33:35.376
You know, she never gave me

33:35.410 --> 33:37.230
any trouble.
Were you sleeping with her?

33:37.280 --> 33:40.340
LESLI:
Mrs. Florrick
asked you a question.

33:41.380 --> 33:43.769
Yeah, look, I liked her.

33:43.820 --> 33:45.640
I knew you would think
it was stupid.

33:45.690 --> 33:47.783
KALINDA:
When was the last time
you talked to ChrIstIna?

33:47.820 --> 33:49.481
Just a few days ago, after work.

33:49.520 --> 33:52.182
And you weren't curious that she
didn't show up for three days?

33:52.230 --> 33:54.448
Nah, she... she does that
once in a while.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.388
To get away from
her boyfriend, um...

33:56.430 --> 33:58.364
Noah something.
He comes by Fine Fitness.

33:58.400 --> 34:01.164
He always waits for her
on his motorcycle.

34:01.200 --> 34:03.293
Every couple of weeks
she just takes a break.

34:03.340 --> 34:04.659
Out of town?
No. Um...

34:04.710 --> 34:07.270
she has a... another place,

34:07.310 --> 34:08.572
in Logan Square.

34:09.880 --> 34:11.541
CLARKE:
Was there anything more

34:11.580 --> 34:13.138
on the Lemond Bishop case?

34:13.180 --> 34:15.216
We won the Franks hearing.

34:15.250 --> 34:17.343
Found out it's about
a mIssmg C.I.

34:17.380 --> 34:21.214
C.I.?
Conﬁdenﬁal
informant.

34:21.260 --> 34:24.081
Ah. Of course.

34:24.130 --> 34:26.280
Any more need
for accounting work on it?

34:26.330 --> 34:28.150
No, no, I think
it's moved on.

34:28.200 --> 34:29.428
Maybe I should stay in case.
No,

34:29.460 --> 34:31.564
no, I-I don't think you have to.

34:31.600 --> 34:33.591
Oh. Okay.

34:38.270 --> 34:40.238
I enjoyed it.

34:40.270 --> 34:41.476
Helping.

34:45.710 --> 34:47.541
You were great.

34:47.580 --> 34:48.740
(chuckles quietly)

34:48.780 --> 34:50.509
The way that you told that guy,

34:50.550 --> 34:53.383
"If you had a 12% rise,
what'd you do with the surplus?"

34:53.420 --> 34:54.455
(clicks tongue)

34:54.490 --> 34:56.219
(laughs)

34:57.620 --> 34:59.656
He didn't like that, did he?

34:59.690 --> 35:03.228
No, he thought you
were gonna mess him up.
(laughs)

35:05.930 --> 35:08.535
You should talk
to family law, Mr. Hayden.

35:08.570 --> 35:12.233
They always have some probate
issues involving accounting.

35:13.340 --> 35:15.774
No. That's not
why I'm here.

35:15.810 --> 35:19.644
You're here...
to help us get out of debt.

35:19.680 --> 35:21.671
That's helping us.

35:24.250 --> 35:25.444
True.

35:25.490 --> 35:27.481
ELI:
The best way to fend off

35:27.520 --> 35:29.488
the story is
to change the story,

35:29.520 --> 35:32.523
and the only way to do that
is by winning big.

35:33.660 --> 35:35.298
Okay, go.

35:37.200 --> 35:38.758
Ms. Starr.
Miss Hayward.

35:38.800 --> 35:40.791
Thanks for agreeing
to see me.
Of course.

35:40.830 --> 35:42.889
Uh, Maddie, what is
going on here?
This young lady

35:42.940 --> 35:44.305
called my office,
said she wanted to talk.

35:44.340 --> 35:46.865
And you agreed?
I just made a public statement
in support of Peter.

35:46.910 --> 35:48.878
I'd like to make sure
I didn't make a fool of myself.

35:48.910 --> 35:50.502
The woman is a consummate liar.

35:50.540 --> 35:52.246
Well, then you have nothing
to worry about.

35:53.850 --> 35:56.171
MAN IN COSTUME:
Hee-haw! Everybody vote!

35:56.220 --> 35:58.188
ALICIA:
Dexter thinks

35:58.220 --> 36:01.519
there's a hideaway key
by the front door, a magnet

36:01.560 --> 36:02.709
under the mailbox.

36:02.760 --> 36:04.728
Okay, great. Got it.

36:04.760 --> 36:06.318
Be careful.

36:06.360 --> 36:08.191
Always.

36:08.230 --> 36:09.424
(beep)

36:11.700 --> 36:13.668
(glass shatters in distance)

36:13.700 --> 36:16.168
(engine sputters, man grunts)

36:18.710 --> 36:20.928
(motorcycle engine starts)

36:28.580 --> 36:30.571
(horn honks in distance)

36:37.460 --> 36:39.451
*

37:03.520 --> 37:04.589
She's dead?

37:04.620 --> 37:05.882
KALIN DA:
It appears so.

37:05.920 --> 37:08.013
Look, given the enclosed space
and temperature,

37:08.050 --> 37:09.950
it's likely the body's
been decomposing

37:09.990 --> 37:11.014
faster than normal.

37:11.060 --> 37:13.927
LESLI:
What about this
boyfriend, this Noah?

37:13.960 --> 37:15.848
KALINDA:
Noah Mayfield.
He's a sound engineer

37:15.900 --> 37:17.595
at a recording
studio on 16th,

37:17.630 --> 37:18.790
and he rides
a motorcycle.

37:18.830 --> 37:20.695
So that's who you saw?
I don't know,

37:20.730 --> 37:22.630
but it's likely.
The question is,

37:22.670 --> 37:25.002
do we make an anonymous call
and let the feds know

37:25.040 --> 37:26.598
about the car?
LESLI:
We don't know

37:26.640 --> 37:29.575
what this Christina woman
gave the feds on Lemond.

37:29.610 --> 37:31.771
If we alert them
to the body, we risk

37:31.810 --> 37:33.801
getting him arrested.
DIANE: She'll be
found eventually.

37:33.850 --> 37:34.669
If it comes out

37:34.720 --> 37:37.018
later... that
we had knowledge of this

37:37.050 --> 37:38.540
and we didn't report it,

37:38.590 --> 37:40.546
they can use it
against him at trial.

37:40.590 --> 37:42.353
LESLI: I'm not
gonna tell anyone.

37:42.390 --> 37:43.880
How will it
get out later?

37:43.920 --> 37:45.854
This is
beyond risky.

37:45.890 --> 37:46.857
(conversation continues
in background)

37:46.890 --> 37:50.326
(quietly):
I've done time before.

37:50.360 --> 37:52.567
But that was
before Dylan.
You'll make bail.

37:52.600 --> 37:54.636
No. I won't.

37:54.670 --> 37:57.468
I need you to draw up
a guardian arrangement.

37:57.500 --> 37:59.331
You have someone in mind?

37:59.370 --> 38:01.770
My sister.

38:01.810 --> 38:04.699
She hates me...
but loves Dylan.

38:04.750 --> 38:06.672
I'll draw it up.

38:09.080 --> 38:11.275
Call the feds.

38:13.020 --> 38:14.817
Tell them about the body.

38:20.090 --> 38:21.557
(indistinct talking nearby)

38:21.600 --> 38:23.591
LANA:
Okay, sounds good.
I'll talk to you.

38:23.630 --> 38:24.699
Good.

38:31.100 --> 38:33.409
Too bad about your boy.

38:33.440 --> 38:34.805
My "boy"?

38:35.840 --> 38:38.604
I didn't mean it that way.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.470
What's wrong?

38:40.510 --> 38:41.943
You're being surly.

38:41.980 --> 38:43.413
What is it you want?

38:43.450 --> 38:46.817
We found Christina Diaz's body.

38:46.850 --> 38:49.057
We got an anonymous tip,

38:49.090 --> 38:51.627
and we found her body
in the trunk of her car.

38:52.660 --> 38:53.752
We done?

38:53.790 --> 38:56.395
We have evidence
linking him to the murder,

38:56.430 --> 38:59.092
and Judge Etts just signed
an arrest warrant.

38:59.130 --> 39:01.860
We prefer Mr. Bishop
turn himself in.

39:02.870 --> 39:03.996
Kalinda.

39:05.670 --> 39:07.501
Yes?

39:07.540 --> 39:10.737
Listen...

39:10.780 --> 39:12.600
it's work.

39:12.650 --> 39:15.039
Don't let it get in the way.

39:15.080 --> 39:16.877
In the way of what?

39:17.920 --> 39:19.478
Of us.

39:20.520 --> 39:23.751
But there isn't any us.

39:23.790 --> 39:26.054
There never was any us.

39:29.630 --> 39:31.120
(crowd chanting):
Peter! Peter!

39:31.160 --> 39:33.162
Peter! Peter! Peter!

39:33.200 --> 39:34.462
Ninety-six percent.

39:34.500 --> 39:35.831
You set a new record

39:35.870 --> 39:37.098
for an Illinois straw poll.

39:37.140 --> 39:39.734
Acavello has announced_
he's droppIng out; Staub Is

39:39.770 --> 39:41.909
huddled with his people.
He'll be gone by breakfast.

39:41.940 --> 39:44.602
Peter, we did what
we needed to do.

39:44.650 --> 39:45.605
You did.

39:45.650 --> 39:46.878
You and Maddie Hayward.

39:46.910 --> 39:48.878
Let's keep her close;
we need more allies

39:48.920 --> 39:50.410
like her!
Peter...

39:50.450 --> 39:52.486
Springfield is this close.

39:52.520 --> 39:53.748
CROWD (chanting):
Peter! Peter!

39:53.790 --> 39:56.054
Peter! Peter! Peter!

39:56.090 --> 39:58.081
(cheering, whooping)

40:08.540 --> 40:10.496
(cheering, whooping continue)

40:10.540 --> 40:12.201
ALICIA:
This is an agreement

40:12.240 --> 40:14.037
naming your sister
as Dylan's guardian

40:14.070 --> 40:16.174
until such time
as your release.

40:16.210 --> 40:18.030
(footsteps approaching)

40:18.080 --> 40:20.173
Sorry to interrupt.

40:20.210 --> 40:23.043
We just heard from
the federal agents.

40:23.080 --> 40:25.514
They'll be here any minute.
My sister's still an hour away.

40:25.550 --> 40:28.087
I'll wait with Dylan
until she gets here.

40:31.690 --> 40:33.726
ALICIA:
Do you have any instructions

40:33.760 --> 40:35.955
you'd like me to pass on to her?

40:36.000 --> 40:38.025
Dylan's a
heavy sleeper.

40:38.060 --> 40:40.790
You have to give him
three wake-up calls.
Okay.

40:40.830 --> 40:42.832
And the kid never...

40:42.870 --> 40:44.701
checks his spelling
or punctuation.

40:44.740 --> 40:46.799
She's gonna have
to stay on top of him

40:46.840 --> 40:48.068
when he does his homework.

40:48.110 --> 40:49.805
Okay.

40:58.280 --> 41:01.147
(cell phone rings)

41:02.260 --> 41:03.215
Hello?

41:03.260 --> 41:04.488
Alicia, it's Maddie Hayward.

41:04.530 --> 41:05.986
I hope I'm not calling too late.

41:06.030 --> 41:08.794
ALICIA:
No, not at all.
Are you

41:08.830 --> 41:10.195
at Peter's celebration?

41:11.230 --> 41:13.698
Um, I have a dilemma,

41:13.730 --> 41:15.960
and I'd like to talk with you.

41:16.000 --> 41:16.989
Of course.

41:17.040 --> 41:19.235
I'm not going to be able

41:19.270 --> 41:21.238
to support
Peter's candidacy anymore.

41:21.270 --> 41:23.135
I...

41:23.180 --> 41:25.569
I-I don't understand.
He won tonight.

41:25.610 --> 41:27.146
He's the only candidate left.

41:27.180 --> 41:30.217
I know, um,
but this Indira Starr business

41:30.250 --> 41:33.048
has, uh... forced me
to reevaluate.

41:33.090 --> 41:34.648
It didn't happen, Maddie.

41:34.690 --> 41:35.918
The woman lied.

41:35.960 --> 41:37.757
I-I would like...

41:37.790 --> 41:41.590
for us to try and-and...
remain friends.

41:41.630 --> 41:43.655
I-I think that you and I are...

41:43.700 --> 41:44.826
simpatico.

41:44.870 --> 41:45.996
Is that possible?

41:46.030 --> 41:48.669
Staying friends?

41:48.700 --> 41:50.190
Sure.

41:52.270 --> 41:54.101
Well... I'd like to try.

41:54.140 --> 41:56.176
Uh, so why don't
I give you your space.

41:56.210 --> 41:57.302
I'll check in with you

41:57.340 --> 41:58.978
in a few days, okay?

41:59.010 --> 42:00.648
Good night, Alicia.

Hi, Dylan.
Why don't you show me

okay, sweetheart?

42:35.920 --> 42:37.649
(knocking)
I'd love to see them.

42:37.680 --> 42:39.682
