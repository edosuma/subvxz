00:35.001 --> 00:37.845
<i>It wasn't meant to be this way.
You know?</i>

00:42.008 --> 00:44.249
<i>We make our plans, sure.</i>

00:44.811 --> 00:46.449
But life...

00:47.680 --> 00:51.127
Life
is what happens to you along the way.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.333
You know, at first,
I didn't want this.

00:56.656 --> 00:58.190
I didn't want to connect.

00:58.191 --> 01:00.225
I didn't want to get involved.

01:00.226 --> 01:02.594
And she kept on at me.
You know?

01:02.595 --> 01:06.042
"This is what life is.
This is why we're here, lo connect.'

01:07.233 --> 01:09.406
"To build."

01:10.904 --> 01:13.475
“We're here to build something."

01:16.176 --> 01:18.952
And then we had Theo.

01:19.479 --> 01:23.586
And then I understood
that she was right.

01:25.952 --> 01:28.523
We're not meant to be alone.

01:33.259 --> 01:35.364
You know what she said to me?

01:35.662 --> 01:38.575
She said
that even the most damaged heart...

01:38.731 --> 01:41.177
can be mended.

01:42.535 --> 01:45.982
Even the most damaged heart.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.445
Yeah.

02:20.039 --> 02:21.950
No, I'm with Vic.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.216
What?

02:27.013 --> 02:28.947
I can't let you in
until Alphonse is home.

02:28.948 --> 02:30.883
Alphonse is on his way.

02:30.884 --> 02:31.884
Where?

02:31.885 --> 02:33.660
In the basement.

02:46.032 --> 02:47.602
Paulie.

02:48.868 --> 02:50.108
No.

03:08.354 --> 03:09.924
It's Paul.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.416
Go.

03:50.863 --> 03:52.843
719... Now you realize.

03:56.169 --> 03:59.838
719... Now you realize.

03:59.839 --> 04:01.182
What?

04:38.478 --> 04:41.280
What the fuck?
This shit is crazy.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.227
Now he's killing us.

04:43.816 --> 04:45.017
Call the locksmith.

04:45.018 --> 04:48.397
And get that asshole
from the alarm company over here.

04:51.891 --> 04:54.132
“Now you realize.”

05:21.120 --> 05:24.033
I know who's doing this to me.

06:11.270 --> 06:12.374
What?

06:15.875 --> 06:17.980
Killed for less.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.648
A little uncouth
to come without a call.

06:23.649 --> 06:25.484
There's a better place
for you to be.

06:25.485 --> 06:26.752
Get out.
Go!

06:26.753 --> 06:28.323
Am I gonna gel paid?

06:38.865 --> 06:41.311
Have you seen this man?

06:41.534 --> 06:42.267
Paul?

06:42.268 --> 06:45.871
- Everyone knows Paul's missing.
- I want you to think before you answer.

06:45.872 --> 06:47.606
Cause I'm getting
to the bottom of this.

06:47.607 --> 06:48.774
The bottom of what?

06:48.775 --> 06:50.812
Three months of letters.

06:51.377 --> 06:53.378
Three months of torment.

06:53.379 --> 06:55.847
Not being able to leave my house
without wondering...

06:55.848 --> 07:00.558
if some coward
is gonna sneak up behind me and."...

07:01.888 --> 07:03.288
Paul was looking into this.

07:03.289 --> 07:05.957
And I think he found exactly
what he was looking for.

07:05.958 --> 07:08.460
But before he could come
and tell me...

07:08.461 --> 07:13.365
my friend Paul
shows up strangled in my freezer.

07:13.366 --> 07:16.643
You've got a lot of enemies,
don't you, Alphonse?

07:18.905 --> 07:22.107
Three months ago
you and I had our disagreement!

07:22.108 --> 07:24.509
I raised my lake to 25 %...

07:24.510 --> 07:27.579
to allow you to continue
to operate in my buildings.

07:27.580 --> 07:29.848
I started getting letters
three months ago!

07:29.849 --> 07:31.316
That's no fucking coincidence!

07:31.317 --> 07:32.517
That's not fucking accurate!

07:32.518 --> 07:34.519
You asked for 30 percent,
and Lon told you...

07:34.520 --> 07:36.321
you could only ask me for 20-.

07:36.322 --> 07:39.991
So if anyone was bent out of shape,
it was you, Alphonse.

07:39.992 --> 07:41.960
Who's in this picture?

07:41.961 --> 07:43.128
I don't fucking know.

07:43.129 --> 07:45.234
- Who is in this picture?
- I don't know!

07:47.266 --> 07:49.935
What am I supposed to realize?

07:49.936 --> 07:53.538
What does 719 mean?
What am I going to fucking realize?

07:53.539 --> 07:55.807
What am I gonna fucking realize?

07:55.808 --> 07:58.109
Darcy,
want to give me a hand there, mate?

07:58.110 --> 08:01.012
- He ain't got shit to do with this!
- He's fucking lying so you shut the fuck up.

08:01.013 --> 08:03.181
I've been picking up
from Harry for over a year.

08:03.182 --> 08:06.251
He's fucking lying
so you shut the fuck up.

08:06.252 --> 08:09.062
I'm gonna ask you again.
What am I supposed to realize?

08:10.523 --> 08:13.525
I don't care
what you think I've done to you...

08:13.526 --> 08:15.894
you are not sanctioned to kill me.

08:15.895 --> 08:18.129
That much I do fucking know.

08:18.130 --> 08:20.265
So it's not on,
you even coming here!

08:20.266 --> 08:21.677
Not on?

08:23.603 --> 08:26.641
The term is not cool.

08:26.906 --> 08:29.574
You fucking English.
You always do shit like that.

08:29.575 --> 08:31.213
That's our system.

08:38.217 --> 08:41.926
And you also
make your sevens like this.

08:56.402 --> 08:58.109
You...

08:58.371 --> 09:00.351
are not sanctioned...

09:01.140 --> 09:03.313
to kill me.

09:05.845 --> 09:07.290
Fuck it.

10:07.673 --> 10:09.741
What the fuck y'all wailing for?

10:09.742 --> 10:11.050
Do it.

10:32.798 --> 10:34.332
Fuck, you've been hit.

10:34.333 --> 10:35.869
Don't worry about it.

11:27.820 --> 11:30.061
A bit better this time.

11:34.694 --> 11:38.540
Will you be all right
to drive yourself home, Beatrice?

12:58.310 --> 13:01.223
You're supposed to lie down
and relax.

13:10.389 --> 13:14.769
I was relaxing so much
I saw a white light.

13:15.161 --> 13:18.096
Well, if you see it again,
don't walk into it.

13:18.097 --> 13:21.340
I still have a lot of things to take out
on you for my childhood.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.179
Beautiful.

13:24.370 --> 13:26.145
I love the color.

13:27.173 --> 13:28.550
It's very PFEW-

13:28.874 --> 13:30.649
I'll run your bath.

14:42.748 --> 14:45.456
Hi, it's your neighbor who waves...

14:53.325 --> 14:54.429
Hello?

14:56.996 --> 14:58.566
Hello?

15:02.334 --> 15:04.371
I got your note.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.012
Hi.

15:13.746 --> 15:14.986
<i>Hi.</i>

15:29.194 --> 15:31.640
I wasn't sure that you got it.

15:31.797 --> 15:34.332
I was wondering
if I put it in the wrong box?

15:34.333 --> 15:35.334
No.

15:35.768 --> 15:38.009
No. It's mine.

15:47.713 --> 15:48.817
So...

15:49.949 --> 15:51.656
The note.

15:53.585 --> 15:56.964
I just thought since we...

15:58.424 --> 16:01.803
I thought it would be nice
lo finally meet you.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.811
Beatrice.

16:13.772 --> 16:15.410
Victor.

16:29.588 --> 16:31.158
No, thanks.

16:46.572 --> 16:48.677
You don't talk a lot.

16:49.708 --> 16:52.018
Not much, no.

16:53.946 --> 16:55.279
It's okay.

16:55.280 --> 16:57.521
I talk enough for both of us.

16:58.150 --> 17:01.324
I talk too much.
Everybody says so.

17:06.992 --> 17:08.903
You speak French?

17:10.229 --> 17:11.561
I'd like lo.

17:11.563 --> 17:13.201
- Yeah?
- Sure.

17:14.833 --> 17:16.675
Another language?

17:17.301 --> 17:18.940
Hungarian.

17:19.605 --> 17:21.642
You're Hungarian?

17:23.675 --> 17:25.915
You don't have an accent.

17:26.712 --> 17:29.420
I worked very hard
lo gel rid of it.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.262
So.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.868
A job.

17:38.924 --> 17:40.562
I'm, uh.-.

17:41.727 --> 17:44.328
Right now
I'm dabbling in real estate.

17:44.329 --> 17:48.099
The people I work
for buy buildings in need of renovation.

17:48.100 --> 17:50.376
Fix them up and run them.

18:10.222 --> 18:11.422
You?

18:11.423 --> 18:12.766
A job?

18:13.759 --> 18:15.067
Yeah.

18:16.995 --> 18:20.731
I was involved
in a car accident last year.

18:20.732 --> 18:23.269
I was a beautician before.

18:24.870 --> 18:28.044
They rebuilt part of my face.

18:28.841 --> 18:32.550
It's kind of hard
to give advice on beauty.

18:33.712 --> 18:35.379
And, uh...

18:35.380 --> 18:38.116
I have to smile a lot
in my job.

18:38.117 --> 18:41.030
Most of the time,
it hurts to smile.

18:45.657 --> 18:48.659
I don't get to smile
so much in my work.

18:48.660 --> 18:49.968
- No?
- No.

18:50.229 --> 18:51.896
Maybe you
and I should switch jobs.

18:51.897 --> 18:52.807
Yeah.

18:55.534 --> 18:57.775
So, what else?

19:00.005 --> 19:02.073
I swear sometimes.

19:02.074 --> 19:03.608
Especially when I drink.

19:03.609 --> 19:04.747
Me, too.

19:05.544 --> 19:07.046
Fuck.

19:07.579 --> 19:09.081
Shit.

19:12.251 --> 19:13.584
Careful.

19:13.585 --> 19:15.155
You're smiling.

19:21.059 --> 19:23.437
Tonight it's worth it.

19:33.572 --> 19:36.348
I want lo take you somewhere.

19:37.709 --> 19:39.746
So where are we going?

19:40.078 --> 19:41.746
Are we going lo a club?

19:41.747 --> 19:42.725
No.

19:42.981 --> 19:43.648
No?

19:43.649 --> 19:44.491
Very cold.

19:44.650 --> 19:45.149
Very cold.

19:45.150 --> 19:45.683
Yeah.

19:45.684 --> 19:49.928
All right.
Well, then are we going to a park?

19:51.490 --> 19:53.470
Warmer.

19:58.931 --> 20:00.865
I thought you talk a lot?

20:00.866 --> 20:02.433
I thought you don't?

20:02.434 --> 20:04.778
Must be the company.
Usually, I don't.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.450
You can turn here.

20:14.379 --> 20:16.484
Pull over.
Just there.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.363
You're afraid
I'll think you came tonight...

20:32.364 --> 20:34.401
because you felt sorry for me.

20:35.901 --> 20:38.769
You don't have to play
these games, Victor.

20:38.770 --> 20:40.613
I know why you really came.

20:41.306 --> 20:44.014
You're just being careful.

20:44.142 --> 20:45.009
You wanted to find out...

20:45.010 --> 20:48.981
if the girl who's been watching you
saw what you did.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.218
I saw you...

20:54.219 --> 20:56.028
kill this man.

21:12.604 --> 21:14.672
I saw you strangle him.

21:14.673 --> 21:16.907
I saw you lake him away.

21:16.908 --> 21:20.446
Now you're trying to clean up a mess
that cannot be cleaned up.

21:21.747 --> 21:23.547
But, I...

21:23.548 --> 21:26.791
I think your secret
will be safe with me.

21:30.255 --> 21:32.166
This is the man...

21:32.357 --> 21:35.668
who hit my car
when he was drunk.

21:38.630 --> 21:41.611
This is the man
who did this lo me.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.310
I want you to kill him.

21:45.570 --> 21:48.439
As you did with the man
in your apartment.

21:48.440 --> 21:50.541
- Wait a minute.
- No.

21:50.542 --> 21:53.778
If you don't do it,
I'll call the police and tell them what I saw.

21:53.779 --> 21:55.146
What the fuck are you...?

21:55.147 --> 21:56.914
His BMW.

21:56.915 --> 21:58.724
It's fixed.

21:58.917 --> 22:01.295
This has never happened.

22:02.521 --> 22:05.297
I can't be fixed.

22:05.757 --> 22:08.025
He sewed three weeks.

22:08.026 --> 22:10.161
Three weeks for what he did lo me.

22:10.162 --> 22:13.464
Stupid Judge,
he sat there and looked at my face.

22:13.465 --> 22:14.498
I want it done.

22:14.499 --> 22:18.470
If you don't do it,
I'll call the police and I'll tell them what I saw.

22:18.637 --> 22:20.171
You'll do it!

22:20.172 --> 22:22.948
You want to save yourself?
Do it!

22:25.043 --> 22:26.613
Fuck!

22:31.450 --> 22:32.783
He didn't pay-

22:32.784 --> 22:33.484
I understand.

22:33.485 --> 22:34.251
He didn't pay-

22:34.252 --> 22:35.853
Slop saying that!
I understand!

22:35.854 --> 22:36.887
Are you gonna do it?

22:36.888 --> 22:38.622
What I did it
has nothing to do with you.

22:38.623 --> 22:40.125
You have to do this!

22:40.692 --> 22:42.560
He ruined my life.

22:42.561 --> 22:44.929
I have nothing.
I am nothing.

22:44.930 --> 22:46.630
I want it done
as soon as possible.

22:46.631 --> 22:50.034
Then I will forget.
I will begin my life.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.702
And I will forget
I that ever met you.

22:51.703 --> 22:53.904
- Do you know what it is to kill a man!
- And I will forget I that ever met you.

22:53.905 --> 22:55.940
It's not a bug! It's not a rat!

22:55.941 --> 22:57.875
I would never kill a bug or a rat!

22:57.876 --> 22:59.210
He's much worse
than these things!

22:59.211 --> 23:00.878
You don't know
what you're getting into with me!

23:00.879 --> 23:02.825
You've no fucking idea!

23:09.488 --> 23:10.955
I could have called the police.

23:10.956 --> 23:12.823
I saved your life.

23:12.824 --> 23:16.237
Now you're gonna give me back mine.

23:16.461 --> 23:20.773
If you're not going to kill me
you don't have a choice-.

23:49.861 --> 23:51.431
Beatrice.

24:58.330 --> 24:59.129
Laszlo.

24:59.130 --> 24:59.997
Sorry I'm late.

24:59.998 --> 25:03.067
You look good.

25:03.068 --> 25:04.668
It's good to see you.

25:04.669 --> 25:07.479
Were you worried
I was going to forget your name.

25:08.640 --> 25:12.213
Convention.
You forget what it's like.

25:26.024 --> 25:30.027
It's Andras who gave us
the body for your grave.

25:30.028 --> 25:31.996
Whose body?

25:31.997 --> 25:35.274
Someone who deserved it,
I'm sure.

25:50.582 --> 25:52.716
We met.

25:52.717 --> 25:57.325
Two days after
when they left you for dead.

25:57.622 --> 25:58.930
Yeah.

26:00.692 --> 26:02.826
Soviet modified Dragunov.

26:02.827 --> 26:05.863
7.62 by 5.4 rounds.

26:05.864 --> 26:07.498
With Russian PSO scopes.

26:07.499 --> 26:10.537
Comes with bayonet
suppressor as well.

26:10.969 --> 26:14.538
Heavier than I expected.

26:14.539 --> 26:16.143
I'll take it.

26:27.452 --> 26:30.228
Okay. All set.

26:32.324 --> 26:34.725
What did he say?

26:34.726 --> 26:36.637
Andras?

26:37.395 --> 26:42.199
For 14 months
you've infiltrated Alphonse.

26:42.200 --> 26:45.235
They wanted to know
why you've been waiting so long...

26:45.236 --> 26:47.705
to do what needs to be done.

26:47.706 --> 26:50.674
He said if he was lucky enough
lo be standing,like you are...

26:50.675 --> 26:52.876
he'd want revenge too.

26:52.877 --> 26:56.880
But we're all worried
you wait loo long.

26:56.881 --> 26:59.683
Always kill the devil quickly
when you find him.

26:59.684 --> 27:01.418
That was his advice.

27:01.419 --> 27:05.155
I said you wanted to be close enough
to watch him suffer.

27:05.156 --> 27:09.571
But I really don't know
the reason you're wailing.

27:19.037 --> 27:22.610
<i>So now say it in English for me.</i>

27:23.108 --> 27:25.376
I... lied

27:25.377 --> 27:25.943
Yes?

27:25.944 --> 27:29.713
I... tied... <i>my</i> shoe.

27:29.714 --> 27:30.948
<i>Today.</i>

27:30.949 --> 27:32.583
<i>You tied what?</i>

27:32.584 --> 27:33.984
My shoe.

27:33.985 --> 27:34.986
<i>Your shoe?</i>

27:38.089 --> 27:39.590
<i>Bigger smile than that.</i>

27:39.591 --> 27:42.333
<i>That's not
the biggest smile you have.</i>

29:03.241 --> 29:05.642
What have I done to you?

29:05.643 --> 29:07.850
Where have you taken me?

29:08.780 --> 29:11.283
I need foodstuffs.

29:36.674 --> 29:38.942
I can help you.

29:38.943 --> 29:41.812
If you let me go,
he will spare you.

29:41.813 --> 29:44.948
My brother
will not stop looking for me.

29:44.949 --> 29:47.896
And he will find you.

29:51.389 --> 29:54.324
Even if you get his money...

29:54.325 --> 29:56.393
even if they pay...

29:56.394 --> 29:58.772
he will find you.

30:03.234 --> 30:06.703
You don't know
who you're messing with!

30:06.704 --> 30:08.581
He will kill you!

30:09.107 --> 30:11.883
He will kill you!

30:16.047 --> 30:18.048
Monster's here.

30:18.049 --> 30:19.516
Monster!

30:19.517 --> 30:20.651
Hey, monster...

30:20.652 --> 30:24.293
if you put a bag on your head
we might hook up with you.

30:25.657 --> 30:28.228
MONSTER

30:42.207 --> 30:44.341
You have to take off
your shoes.

30:44.342 --> 30:47.687
My morn
likes lo keep the floor clean.

30:54.986 --> 30:57.489
How long will it take?

30:58.256 --> 31:01.032
Long enough lo be prepared.

31:03.394 --> 31:08.332
You say he goes to this bar...
every night.

31:08.333 --> 31:09.333
Yeah.

31:09.334 --> 31:11.301
You know where he works?

31:11.302 --> 31:13.570
He's looking for work.

31:13.571 --> 31:16.518
As much as I could find out, I did.

31:26.284 --> 31:29.322
I never thought about it before.

31:29.754 --> 31:31.734
Revenge.

31:35.627 --> 31:39.598
When I saw you
kill that man in your apartment...

31:41.232 --> 31:44.008
I knew I had my answer.

31:51.109 --> 31:53.749
Why did you do it?

31:56.915 --> 31:59.983
I just want to know more
about you.

31:59.984 --> 32:02.021
I'm not here by choice.

32:09.894 --> 32:11.495
We have company.

32:11.496 --> 32:14.807
She can't hear us.
She lost most of her hearing as a child.

32:23.708 --> 32:27.155
I'm looking
for my hearing aids.

32:31.983 --> 32:34.651
Hello.
Nice lo meet you.

32:34.652 --> 32:35.686
Nice lo meet you.

32:35.687 --> 32:38.021
Well. Very good.

32:38.022 --> 32:39.556
You want to stay for lunch.

32:39.557 --> 32:41.992
We're having chicken.
Lemon chicken. It's very good.

32:41.993 --> 32:44.428
And cookies.

32:44.429 --> 32:47.130
We love cookies
in this house.

32:47.131 --> 32:47.798
You want a cookie?

32:47.799 --> 32:49.066
I can't stay.

32:49.067 --> 32:54.016
I want lo show you something.

32:59.877 --> 33:03.347
Pictures of Beatrice.

33:03.348 --> 33:06.693
You can see
she has excellent genes.

33:08.786 --> 33:11.824
You see
how beautiful she is?

33:52.130 --> 33:55.577
I want it done
as soon as possible.

34:00.738 --> 34:02.606
<i>Mama“.</i>

34:02.607 --> 34:05.087
Victor has to go.

34:08.813 --> 34:11.348
Au revoir, Victor.

34:11.349 --> 34:13.329
It was nice meeting you.

34:16.687 --> 34:19.600
You'll hear from me
when it's done.

34:20.024 --> 34:21.925
Cookies.

34:21.926 --> 34:24.338
It's for you.
Take them.

34:28.299 --> 34:31.610
A bit gfllmPY-

35:20.384 --> 35:21.985
Crackerjack.

35:21.986 --> 35:24.023
Got any grass?

35:24.722 --> 35:26.861
That depends.

35:28.626 --> 35:31.294
Information is power,
my friend.

35:31.295 --> 35:32.963
You see anyone
take a photo up here?

35:32.964 --> 35:34.731
Already told.

35:34.732 --> 35:35.966
Already told who?

35:35.967 --> 35:39.069
Another guy.
A guy like you.

35:39.070 --> 35:41.482
This is my friend, Paul.

35:42.406 --> 35:44.113
Did you tell him?

35:52.483 --> 35:54.484
<i>Hello. Alphonse?</i>

35:54.485 --> 35:56.219
<i>You know,
people are ﬂipping out.</i>

35:56.220 --> 35:58.088
<i>You weren't sanctioned to do Harry.</i>

35:58.089 --> 35:58.889
<i>or his men.</i>

35:58.890 --> 36:01.491
<i>Or leave a house
full of dead Jamaicans!</i>

36:01.492 --> 36:04.261
- No, I told you... Look, Lon...
- Try to imagine...

36:04.262 --> 36:06.496
<i>Can you imagine
what the fuck I'm dealing with?</i>

36:06.497 --> 36:07.164
<i>No.</i>

36:07.165 --> 36:08.865
<i>You need to come
and see me right now.</i>

36:08.866 --> 36:11.468
<i>You don't appreciate
the severity of this.</i>

36:11.469 --> 36:15.076
<i>You come now.
I'm gonna be at Cafe Cora.</i>

36:35.026 --> 36:36.869
So...

36:37.628 --> 36:40.666
We got dead Jamaicans?

36:41.165 --> 36:43.406
I'm listening.

36:45.436 --> 36:47.837
Well, Lon.

36:47.838 --> 36:52.509
For the last three months,
Harry was messing with me.

36:52.510 --> 36:54.377
Trying to freak me out.

36:54.378 --> 36:57.147
Sending little notes like this.

36:57.148 --> 37:02.393
With pictures and threats,
and fucked up shit.

37:04.021 --> 37:05.355
719, Now you Realize...

37:05.356 --> 37:09.459
I don't think he was too happy
with the percentage deal.

37:09.460 --> 37:10.460
Okay.

37:10.461 --> 37:12.662
I went in there to gel answers...

37:12.663 --> 37:15.371
not dead Jamaicans.

37:16.200 --> 37:19.113
Turned out that way.

37:20.037 --> 37:22.572
I lost two guys.

37:22.573 --> 37:25.976
And truth is, I could
have been just as dead as both of them.

37:25.977 --> 37:27.477
You know Joe Bragg?

37:27.478 --> 37:29.048
And Herbert?

37:29.213 --> 37:30.447
Lowell Khan.

37:30.448 --> 37:32.549
And Weinberg?

37:32.550 --> 37:34.951
They're my colleagues.

37:34.952 --> 37:36.553
Yeah.

37:36.554 --> 37:38.255
Each...

37:38.256 --> 37:42.033
received photos like these.

38:04.148 --> 38:05.348
Yeah?

38:05.349 --> 38:06.716
<i>Yo, Vic.
Where're you at?</i>

38:06.717 --> 38:08.018
I'm in the middle of something.

38:08.019 --> 38:09.619
Hey, listen, I was right.

38:09.620 --> 38:10.720
Alphonse is still in danger-.

38:10.721 --> 38:13.668
It's not Harry
and his men doing this shit.

38:14.225 --> 38:15.792
How do you know that?

38:15.793 --> 38:18.561
<i>You know Cafe Cora?
Can you get there?</i>

38:18.562 --> 38:19.729
<i>I can find it.</i>

38:19.730 --> 38:21.865
Alphonse
is there with Lon Gordon.

38:21.866 --> 38:24.067
I'm gonna call the rest of the crew
and get them down there.

38:24.068 --> 38:25.335
How'd you know it wasn't Harry?

38:25.336 --> 38:26.610
I'll be there in five.

38:29.106 --> 38:30.551
Fuck.

38:32.076 --> 38:33.453
Yo, Terry.

38:33.678 --> 38:34.344
Yeah?

38:34.345 --> 38:37.147
I'm gonna look at these photos
another way.

38:37.148 --> 38:40.617
Cause whoever's doing this
ls taking it seriously enough now...

38:40.618 --> 38:43.953
lo let us know
that loans to you are not secure.

38:43.954 --> 38:47.492
That's respect enough
to let us know his intentions.

38:49.060 --> 38:51.370
You're not gonna be around.

38:51.962 --> 38:53.363
You may not be around to collect.

38:53.364 --> 38:55.665
Lon, that's exactly
what Harry wanted you lo think.

38:55.666 --> 38:57.475
I got a note too.

38:58.135 --> 38:59.637
This morning.

39:02.573 --> 39:05.076
It's addressed to you.

39:06.711 --> 39:10.352
Englishmen and Jamaicans,
they don't send notes like this.

39:10.715 --> 39:12.956
Not after they've been killed...

39:13.351 --> 39:14.989
in their own house.

39:27.598 --> 39:31.637
719, now you realize <i>I</i> It's not the 7

39:33.971 --> 39:35.678
What does it mean?

39:37.108 --> 39:39.019
What does it mean?

39:40.010 --> 39:41.853
And this key...

39:42.413 --> 39:44.051
was taped to it.

39:48.886 --> 39:51.332
You know what that key is for?

39:57.161 --> 40:00.230
I want you lo get the books
and deeds together for me now.

40:00.231 --> 40:00.997
Fine.

40:00.998 --> 40:03.171
Every building you owe us for.

40:04.769 --> 40:06.836
You understand this,
don't you?

40:06.837 --> 40:09.506
So the uptown buildings,
you're pulling out of the deal.

40:09.507 --> 40:11.043
We're not pulling out.

40:12.443 --> 40:15.287
You're just in no condition
right now to pull in.

40:22.119 --> 40:23.496
Shit!

40:42.440 --> 40:44.545
- Alphonse...
- Not right now.

40:45.976 --> 40:47.751
There's a problem.

40:48.279 --> 40:49.917
We need to go.

41:12.703 --> 41:14.478
UNKNOWN
Did you get the key

41:14.905 --> 41:15.572
He's here.

41:15.573 --> 41:16.176
What?

41:16.307 --> 41:17.507
On, shit!

41:17.508 --> 41:18.808
- Get down!
- Shit!

41:18.809 --> 41:20.220
Jesus!
Get down!

41:30.888 --> 41:33.198
Darcy!
He's up on the roof!

41:33.657 --> 41:35.295
Get in the car!

41:36.494 --> 41:37.996
Up there!

41:39.029 --> 41:40.531
9°, Q9, go, go!

41:45.870 --> 41:47.403
Get the fuck out of here!

41:47.404 --> 41:49.005
Luco!
You watch the elevator!

41:49.006 --> 41:49.639
Yeah!

41:49.640 --> 41:50.707
Dolph and Charles
come upstairs!

41:50.708 --> 41:52.619
Kilroy, back stairs with me!
Now!

42:27.111 --> 42:29.512
Darcy,
he got out from the fifth floor.

42:29.513 --> 42:30.046
What?

42:30.047 --> 42:31.390
He went out the window!

42:31.949 --> 42:33.416
From the fifth fucking floor?

42:33.417 --> 42:34.418
He's crazy.

42:36.587 --> 42:38.089
<i>Darcy!</i>

42:41.158 --> 42:42.692
What the fuck?

42:42.693 --> 42:44.900
Shit! Fuck!

42:58.008 --> 42:59.316
Victor.

43:12.856 --> 43:14.494
Shit!

43:15.326 --> 43:16.926
Where is he?

43:16.927 --> 43:18.227
They wasted Goff.

43:18.228 --> 43:20.674
- They wasted Charles, too.
- Over here! Come on!

43:31.742 --> 43:33.209
Get in!

43:33.210 --> 43:34.553
Come on!

43:40.117 --> 43:41.824
Over here!

43:42.586 --> 43:44.224
Come on!

43:53.564 --> 43:55.805
What the fuck are you doing?

44:06.143 --> 44:07.178
Turn the fuck around!

44:07.277 --> 44:09.188
Turn the fuck around!

44:12.449 --> 44:14.584
- What the fuck!
- Hi. I'm Beatrice.

44:14.585 --> 44:15.451
You told me to get here.

44:15.452 --> 44:17.253
I'm sorry I made him late.

44:17.254 --> 44:18.354
What's going on?

44:18.355 --> 44:19.455
See you later.

44:19.456 --> 44:20.857
Did you see anyone running here, Vic?

44:20.858 --> 44:21.257
No.

44:21.258 --> 44:22.125
On, shit!

44:22.126 --> 44:25.039
He took out Blotto,
Goff and even Charles.

44:26.330 --> 44:27.997
We lost him.

44:27.998 --> 44:28.999
Fuck!

44:29.466 --> 44:31.309
You guys all right?

44:33.303 --> 44:35.304
Tell him
what you told me about the cab.

44:35.305 --> 44:37.106
This guy in the building...

44:37.107 --> 44:40.088
he saw a man
take this photo from the stairwell.

44:40.177 --> 44:42.645
Then they seen him getting into a cab.
A gypsy cab.

44:42.646 --> 44:45.348
Paul was there, loo.
Found out the same thing.

44:45.349 --> 44:48.796
It must've led him to something,
because he was wasted for it.

44:49.653 --> 44:52.031
Find out where the cab went.

44:56.994 --> 44:59.195
What did you do that for?

44:59.196 --> 45:00.396
What I do what for?

45:00.397 --> 45:01.731
Go looking with the pictures.

45:01.732 --> 45:04.133
You've only been on this crew
a month longer than I have.

45:04.134 --> 45:05.568
What if all this shit
happening lo Alphonse...

45:05.569 --> 45:08.482
is because of something
that went down before you came?

45:09.573 --> 45:12.175
This is an opportunity
of magnumus proportions to me.

45:12.176 --> 45:12.909
How's that?

45:12.910 --> 45:15.211
Of finding my next step
in the organization.

45:15.212 --> 45:18.081
Yeah, well there might not be much
of an organization left.

45:18.082 --> 45:20.817
I could run this place for him, Victor.

45:20.818 --> 45:24.527
Better than Terry,
a whole lot better than fucking Kilroy.

45:26.156 --> 45:27.533
I ain't joking around.

45:29.460 --> 45:31.060
If I could just crack this shit for...

45:31.061 --> 45:32.428
This is serious shit, Darcy.

45:32.429 --> 45:34.797
Have enough money lo buy Lise
and Theo what they need.

45:34.798 --> 45:36.232
Move up the ladder.

45:36.233 --> 45:37.610
Fuck!

45:37.968 --> 45:40.369
It's Lisa's car.
Mine's in the shop.

45:40.370 --> 45:41.370
What?
Are you back with her?

45:41.371 --> 45:43.172
Yeah,
she's acknowledging me.

45:43.173 --> 45:44.874
It's a start right?

45:44.875 --> 45:48.411
I promised her I'd make a plan.
Get ahead.

45:48.412 --> 45:51.018
For her, and for Theo.

45:56.754 --> 45:59.132
Just don't get too smart.

45:59.790 --> 46:01.895
You saw what happened to Paul.

46:02.192 --> 46:05.105
- I don't want anything to happen to you.
- I'm smarter than Paul.

46:05.429 --> 46:07.363
I'm tired of being taken
for a fucking douche.

46:07.364 --> 46:09.899
- I saw Alphonse respected me there-
-Oh, yeah-.

46:09.900 --> 46:11.300
I saw it in his eyes.

46:11.301 --> 46:13.679
Go ahead.
We're good.

46:14.438 --> 46:14.837
HOYT

46:14.838 --> 46:16.146
HOYT

46:36.960 --> 46:38.132
Go on.

46:38.629 --> 46:40.540
What the fuck.

46:53.777 --> 46:57.748
<i>I tied my shoe today.</i>

47:02.186 --> 47:06.157
<i>I tied my shoe today.</i>

47:10.761 --> 47:14.732
<i>I tied my shoe today.</i>

47:19.736 --> 47:21.137
Allo?

47:21.138 --> 47:23.673
<i>Hello.
This is Victor, is Beatrice...</i>

47:23.674 --> 47:24.373
Allo?

47:24.374 --> 47:27.912
Hello. This is Victor.
ls Beatrice there?

47:30.514 --> 47:31.647
Hello.

47:31.648 --> 47:33.059
It's me.

47:35.285 --> 47:37.687
<i>I believe
you have something of mine?</i>

47:37.688 --> 47:39.167
Yeah.

47:42.526 --> 47:44.767
Why did you follow me?

47:45.095 --> 47:46.938
It's not the first time.

47:47.798 --> 47:50.711
I wanted lo find out
more about you.

47:56.473 --> 47:58.646
I think it's lucky I did-.

48:30.674 --> 48:32.074
You want some water?

48:32.075 --> 48:33.213
Sure.

49:01.038 --> 49:03.609
So... Who are you?

49:15.252 --> 49:17.892
My real name is Laszlo Kerik.

49:19.589 --> 49:21.762
I was born in Hungary.

49:22.326 --> 49:25.899
A few years ago my wife
and I came to America.

49:27.531 --> 49:30.375
I was an engineer before.

49:31.835 --> 49:34.281
We came here looking for work.

49:35.772 --> 49:38.878
We took an apartment
in a building.

49:40.444 --> 49:43.288
It was a building
they wanted lo control.

49:44.915 --> 49:46.758
The men I saw?

49:49.353 --> 49:51.856
They got most people
out of the building.

49:52.522 --> 49:54.763
One night they came...

49:55.292 --> 49:57.626
and they fired some shots.

49:57.627 --> 49:59.295
To scare us.

49:59.296 --> 50:01.333
So we would leave.

50:02.733 --> 50:05.839
A bullet went through a wall...

50:06.470 --> 50:09.383
and my daughter
was killed while she slept.

50:26.757 --> 50:30.398
We were going to testify.
My wife and I.

50:30.927 --> 50:33.396
The man responsible for it all...

50:33.397 --> 50:35.035
Alphonse.

50:35.232 --> 50:38.679
He gave his orders
to make sure he never went to trial.

50:40.837 --> 50:42.874
And they were followed.

50:45.442 --> 50:47.777
He was afraid to use his own guys, so...

50:47.778 --> 50:50.452
they sent a crew
of Albanians after us.

50:51.815 --> 50:54.591
They killed my wife.

50:55.052 --> 50:57.828
And they thought they killed me too.

50:58.355 --> 51:00.733
And they should have made sure of it.

51:08.698 --> 51:10.336
Cigarette?

51:11.368 --> 51:12.540
Yeah.

51:43.300 --> 51:46.543
When I manage
to forget what happened to me.

51:47.804 --> 51:52.804
When there are no mirrors,
and no people that reminds me.

51:53.477 --> 51:55.923
And my mom makes me laugh.

51:57.581 --> 51:59.219
These moments.

51:59.649 --> 52:01.424
I have hope.

52:08.792 --> 52:11.363
Maman says that I...

52:12.095 --> 52:16.134
that it's these moments
that makes the pain bearable.

52:17.200 --> 52:19.180
These moments...

52:20.270 --> 52:24.473
I should try
and find them where I can and...

52:24.474 --> 52:26.283
hang onto them.

52:27.511 --> 52:29.712
But they're fleeting.

52:29.713 --> 52:31.847
And then I remember and...

52:31.848 --> 52:34.383
I'm filled with so much hale...

52:34.384 --> 52:37.422
that I want to set
the whole world on fire.

52:43.660 --> 52:46.766
I'm sorry
I made you tell about your family.

52:46.930 --> 52:49.999
I don't want to be one
of those people that reminds you.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.446
You're the one who
is going to help me forget-.

52:55.238 --> 52:57.173
These men...

52:57.174 --> 52:59.942
They don't seem easy to beat.

52:59.943 --> 53:03.012
And you might
have used up all your luck.

53:03.013 --> 53:04.287
So...

53:11.488 --> 53:12.933
It's yellow.

53:13.390 --> 53:15.097
Chartreuse.

53:15.825 --> 53:17.600
Keep it.

53:18.094 --> 53:20.074
I need you around.

53:25.101 --> 53:27.945
Rabbits don't come in chartreuse.

53:38.381 --> 53:40.884
Did you eat the cookies?

53:41.151 --> 53:42.323
No.

53:43.753 --> 53:46.393
Maman makes a good cookie.

53:49.092 --> 53:51.227
I only ask you
to return the Tupperware.

53:51.228 --> 53:53.299
She likes her Tupperware.

54:05.508 --> 54:08.421
Have you made any progress?

54:10.247 --> 54:11.351
I will.

54:12.115 --> 54:13.355
I know.

54:14.851 --> 54:18.520
Because I realize now if I call the police
and tell them what I saw...

54:18.521 --> 54:20.831
it's not prison you're afraid of.

54:21.324 --> 54:24.703
It's that you won't get lo finish
your revenge.

54:39.309 --> 54:44.046
<i>I'm going to steep
in my own bed.</i>

54:44.047 --> 54:46.715
<i>And why are you going to sleep
in your own bed?</i>

54:46.716 --> 54:51.453
<i>Because Daddy
takes care of the monsters.</i>

54:51.454 --> 54:53.389
<i>All right, baby.
Tell me once more, all right?</i>

54:53.390 --> 54:57.393
<i>Because Daddy keeps care
of the monsters.</i>

54:57.394 --> 55:00.568
<i>That's not the biggest smile
you have.</i>

55:07.504 --> 55:09.950
<i>That's not the biggest smile
you have.</i>

55:11.574 --> 55:14.243
<i>And why are you going to sleep
in your own bed?</i>

55:14.244 --> 55:18.814
<i>Because Daddy
keeps care of the monsters.</i>

55:18.815 --> 55:20.883
<i>Why baby?
Tell me once more. Why?</i>

55:20.884 --> 55:24.730
<i>Because Daddy
keeps care of the monsters.</i>

55:50.947 --> 55:53.148
I'm so happy that you're here.

55:53.149 --> 55:54.594
Yeah.

55:55.118 --> 55:57.653
I just needed some time,
Florence.

55:57.654 --> 55:59.531
Now I'm going to cry.

56:00.857 --> 56:04.498
I was worried
when you didn't contact my friend.

56:05.729 --> 56:07.062
Nicholas.

56:07.063 --> 56:07.763
The therapist.

56:07.764 --> 56:08.864
Oh, yeah.

56:08.865 --> 56:11.700
He really did wonders
helping me out.

56:11.701 --> 56:13.703
He could help you.

56:16.339 --> 56:18.910
I found someone else.

56:19.476 --> 56:22.277
As long as
you're getting the help you need.

56:22.278 --> 56:23.689
Yeah.

56:25.315 --> 56:27.158
I'm in good hands.

57:11.995 --> 57:14.839
You clever motherfucker.

58:25.468 --> 58:28.506
I'm gonna open the windows.
It's fucking hot in here.

58:29.305 --> 58:31.306
Hey, Kilroy,
you want something to eat?

58:31.307 --> 58:33.082
Yeah, I could eat.

58:36.179 --> 58:38.489
I'm in my office.

58:45.321 --> 58:47.961
You guys want a game?

59:13.016 --> 59:14.461
Come on.

59:15.885 --> 59:17.523
Come on!

59:21.491 --> 59:22.993
<i>HEY-</i>

59:23.326 --> 59:24.860
anything going on?

59:24.861 --> 59:26.033
No.

59:29.065 --> 59:29.998
Any pick ups?

59:29.999 --> 59:32.301
Make sure
you keep your cell on.

59:32.302 --> 59:34.407
I don't know
what Al's got going.

59:43.179 --> 59:45.581
<i>Are you sure it's the AR 43?</i>

59:45.582 --> 59:48.083
Yeah, I'm sure.
I'm looking at it right here.

59:48.084 --> 59:49.918
<i>It was installed two days ago.</i>

59:49.919 --> 59:52.160
Then there is nothing wrong
with your remote.

59:52.689 --> 59:55.357
<i>There's a barrier
your signal won't get through.</i>

59:55.358 --> 59:58.393
<i>The AR3 is an KR unit...</i>

59:58.394 --> 01:00:00.862
<i>that is used in banks
and government buildings.</i>

01:00:00.863 --> 01:00:02.998
<i>What is the application
for your trigger?</i>

01:00:02.999 --> 01:00:04.099
<i>Warehouse.</i>

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:05.701
That's interference.

01:00:05.702 --> 01:00:09.338
<i>You will have to be inside the LR ring,
or forget it.</i>

01:00:09.339 --> 01:00:12.207
<i>Unless you start from scratch
and go to a new system.</i>

01:00:12.208 --> 01:00:14.242
No, I can't do that.
Not enough time.

01:00:14.243 --> 01:00:19.022
Too much interference.
You <i>would</i> have to detonate inside.

01:00:21.184 --> 01:00:23.960
<i>You lost a wife
and a daughter.</i>

01:00:24.187 --> 01:00:25.962
<i>But don't forget...</i>

01:00:26.222 --> 01:00:29.795
<i>I lost a niece
and her little one.</i>

01:00:30.793 --> 01:00:34.764
<i>I don't want
to lose you too.</i>

01:00:57.453 --> 01:00:59.626
Now you know everything.

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:05.336
No.
No, I don't.

01:01:05.895 --> 01:01:09.206
How come an engineer
knows so much about guns?

01:01:09.365 --> 01:01:12.278
Military service.
Back home.

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:18.082
So, what you said on the phone.
Is that your plan?

01:01:18.441 --> 01:01:21.388
To get everybody
into this warehouse?

01:01:22.445 --> 01:01:23.812
Yes.

01:01:23.813 --> 01:01:26.081
Alphonse is always there.

01:01:26.082 --> 01:01:29.188
I just need
to get the Albanians there, too.

01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:31.559
There are many men.

01:01:32.422 --> 01:01:36.063
But,
your bombs doesn't work.

01:01:37.093 --> 01:01:38.663
They work.

01:01:38.761 --> 01:01:41.742
That's one way of looking at it.

01:01:41.998 --> 01:01:45.309
Another is you don't care
if you get out of there.

01:01:48.938 --> 01:01:51.509
You'd rather die than fail.

01:01:52.575 --> 01:01:53.775
Don't worry about it.

01:01:53.776 --> 01:01:56.416
I'll be around long enough to do
what you asked me to do.

01:01:56.813 --> 01:01:59.347
I don't want you to do that.
Bring me food.

01:01:59.348 --> 01:02:00.816
My morn likes lo cook.

01:02:00.817 --> 01:02:02.718
It would
just go to waste otherwise.

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:08.897
I'll wedge it in between the mustard
and plastic explosives.

01:02:09.592 --> 01:02:12.194
You may not care
if you get out alive...

01:02:12.195 --> 01:02:14.869
but in the meantime,
you should eat.

01:02:23.673 --> 01:02:25.674
My rabbit's foot.

01:02:25.675 --> 01:02:28.713
If you don't believe in it,
I'll take it back.

01:02:35.852 --> 01:02:37.354
Bye.

01:02:48.498 --> 01:02:50.732
Delivery Confirmation

01:02:50.733 --> 01:02:52.235
Sign right here.

01:02:59.375 --> 01:03:00.547
Ilir.

01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:05.807
<i>Hello'?</i>

01:04:05.808 --> 01:04:07.809
<i>Hey, 'IVs Fonz.
Listen.</i>

01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:09.477
<i>I found this lawyer.</i>

01:04:09.478 --> 01:04:13.081
He says he can close
financing for the uptown buildings.

01:04:13.082 --> 01:04:16.251
And he don't know anything
about Lon pulling out.

01:04:16.252 --> 01:04:18.286
<i>Is this guy clean'?</i>

01:04:18.287 --> 01:04:19.054
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:04:19.055 --> 01:04:20.455
He wants to see
the Commerce Building.

01:04:20.456 --> 01:04:23.258
So I'm gonna meet him
there tonight at nine.

01:04:23.259 --> 01:04:25.460
<i>What if our problem shows up?</i>

01:04:25.461 --> 01:04:28.465
<i>Fucking 'I don't know'
kind of shit, man.</i>

01:04:28.598 --> 01:04:31.044
<i>No, you're the only one that knows.</i>

01:04:32.969 --> 01:04:35.006
<i>I</i> gotta go-

01:05:01.998 --> 01:05:02.931
Yeah.

01:05:02.932 --> 01:05:04.775
Yo, Vic.
You with anybody?

01:05:05.334 --> 01:05:06.735
Yeah.
I'm busy.

01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:09.804
Well, drop your dick.
I found the gypsy cab.

01:05:09.805 --> 01:05:12.040
<i>The guy at the cab company says
he remembers Paul.</i>

01:05:12.041 --> 01:05:13.241
<i>Paul was there.</i>

01:05:13.242 --> 01:05:15.443
<i>I'm like a detective,
a detective, man.</i>

01:05:15.444 --> 01:05:18.516
Like Columbo.
I'm scaring myself.

01:05:19.115 --> 01:05:20.482
Vic.

01:05:20.483 --> 01:05:21.750
<i>1'“ be right down.</i>

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:22.695
Right.

01:05:35.898 --> 01:05:37.138
Hey, Vic.

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:39.940
Vic.
This girl you're seeing.

01:05:40.236 --> 01:05:41.770
She your girlfriend?

01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:43.738
No.
Nothing serious.

01:05:43.739 --> 01:05:46.274
She's got...
Her face.

01:05:46.275 --> 01:05:48.877
Yeah.
Car accident.

01:05:48.878 --> 01:05:50.779
Does it affect her?

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.453
You have no idea.

01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:55.920
Hey,
you never mentioned her before.

01:05:56.919 --> 01:05:58.920
You embarrassed about me?

01:05:58.921 --> 01:06:01.834
- Yeah, I'm embarrassed about you.
- You're embarrassed about your friends, huh?

01:06:04.026 --> 01:06:05.126
So?

01:06:05.127 --> 01:06:07.471
This is it right here.

01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:11.599
The cab
dropped off Paul right here.

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:12.267
You're sure?

01:06:12.268 --> 01:06:13.401
Yeah.

01:06:13.402 --> 01:06:16.440
They keep a track,
drop offs, pick ups.

01:06:19.141 --> 01:06:21.849
All right, detective?
Can we leave now?

01:06:29.418 --> 01:06:30.988
A cemetery?

01:06:31.887 --> 01:06:33.332
That's creepy.

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:47.168
The office is closed tomorrow.
But I could call them.

01:06:47.169 --> 01:06:49.504
Maybe I'll come by
with a picture of Paul.

01:06:49.505 --> 01:06:51.906
See if anybody knows anything.

01:06:51.907 --> 01:06:53.045
All right.

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:55.182
Fuck.

01:06:55.945 --> 01:06:57.812
Come on.
I gotta get out of here.

01:06:57.813 --> 01:06:58.380
Everything okay?

01:06:58.381 --> 01:06:58.847
Yeah.

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:01.351
I just got some business
to take care of.

01:07:56.138 --> 01:07:57.981
Come on in.

01:08:31.573 --> 01:08:34.145
So what did you tell Darcy?

01:08:37.746 --> 01:08:39.714
Your text said
not to tell anyone I was coming.

01:08:39.715 --> 01:08:41.353
I told him I was...

01:08:41.917 --> 01:08:43.760
I had something to do.

01:08:45.787 --> 01:08:47.698
Here's your food.

01:09:00.703 --> 01:09:03.616
I set a trap, Victor.

01:09:05.774 --> 01:09:09.745
I said whoever walks
through that door at nine o'clock...

01:09:09.879 --> 01:09:13.053
was going to have a real bad night.

01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:21.834
The person doing this to me...

01:09:22.224 --> 01:09:23.794
he's hurt.

01:09:26.629 --> 01:09:30.736
Someone who lost someone.

01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:35.548
Like the people in the picture.

01:09:36.238 --> 01:09:39.617
And he's in a great deal of pain
because of the...

01:09:41.477 --> 01:09:44.515
And it's a pain that I've caused.

01:09:49.451 --> 01:09:51.692
Then he kills Paul.

01:09:52.787 --> 01:09:56.031
And found he was in both feel.

01:09:57.526 --> 01:10:00.564
Victor,
I want him to know something.

01:10:00.763 --> 01:10:03.765
I want him to know that
if there's anything left in his world...

01:10:03.766 --> 01:10:05.939
that he still cares about.

01:10:06.368 --> 01:10:08.939
I'm going to find it.

01:10:09.438 --> 01:10:12.385
And I'm gonna burn it down.

01:10:17.146 --> 01:10:21.720
He's probably wondering right now
what I'm thinking.

01:10:21.984 --> 01:10:24.157
What my plan is.

01:10:24.954 --> 01:10:27.798
And how much I know.

01:10:30.259 --> 01:10:34.833
Wouldn't you be wondering
what I'm thinking?

01:10:37.666 --> 01:10:39.509
I would.

01:10:46.675 --> 01:10:50.122
You know,
you're the only one I can trust, Victor.

01:10:51.213 --> 01:10:52.988
You know why?

01:10:53.983 --> 01:10:55.223
No.

01:10:55.651 --> 01:10:59.428
Because you saved my life
at Harry's.

01:11:03.125 --> 01:11:05.366
It would be something though.

01:11:05.561 --> 01:11:07.762
If you saved my life...

01:11:07.763 --> 01:11:11.108
only to be the one
who kills me.

01:11:20.075 --> 01:11:21.850
Have a seal.

01:12:02.217 --> 01:12:04.925
I must stand, please.

01:12:06.221 --> 01:12:08.462
They're outside.

01:12:09.291 --> 01:12:11.159
The other day...

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:13.728
you told me
that if I helped you...

01:12:13.729 --> 01:12:14.529
Yes!

01:12:14.530 --> 01:12:17.010
Believe what I say,
my friend.

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:19.901
I don't know my boss...

01:12:19.902 --> 01:12:21.506
He will not know.

01:12:22.838 --> 01:12:24.875
You guarantee that?

01:12:25.774 --> 01:12:27.685
That I won't be harmed?

01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:30.912
I swear to God.
Please.

01:12:30.913 --> 01:12:31.846
You're asking me these things...

01:12:31.847 --> 01:12:33.748
so I know
you've been thinking about it.

01:12:33.749 --> 01:12:35.023
About me in here.

01:12:38.287 --> 01:12:39.459
All right.

01:12:40.022 --> 01:12:44.092
Listen lo me.
You're in the city... all right?

01:12:44.093 --> 01:12:47.628
You're in the basement
of my boss's warehouse.

01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:51.232
His name is Alphonse.
Alphonse Hoyt.

01:12:51.233 --> 01:12:54.112
I don't know what your brother
or his men did to him.

01:12:54.336 --> 01:12:57.874
They're gonna kill you
whether he pays or not.

01:13:00.175 --> 01:13:02.377
I got a camera.

01:13:02.378 --> 01:13:04.045
You can record a message
for your brother.

01:13:04.046 --> 01:13:05.753
I'll make sure he gels it.

01:13:06.682 --> 01:13:08.416
We gotta go fast.

01:13:08.417 --> 01:13:08.916
Thank you.

01:13:08.917 --> 01:13:09.851
Tell him where you are.

01:13:09.852 --> 01:13:11.452
It's important
to tell him where you are.

01:13:11.453 --> 01:13:12.796
I swear to you.

01:13:15.958 --> 01:13:17.335
Speak.

01:13:54.296 --> 01:13:55.934
Thank you.

01:13:56.331 --> 01:13:58.242
I promise you...

01:14:12.214 --> 01:14:14.125
We killed you.

01:14:14.516 --> 01:14:16.154
We killed you all!

01:14:16.585 --> 01:14:17.985
We killed you all!

01:14:17.986 --> 01:14:22.298
I swear on their graves,
you didn't.

01:14:23.992 --> 01:14:25.593
I swear!

01:14:25.594 --> 01:14:28.575
I swear on their graves,
you didn't!

01:14:35.604 --> 01:14:37.271
No, no, no!

01:14:37.272 --> 01:14:37.875
No!

01:14:38.073 --> 01:14:39.450
No!

01:14:39.641 --> 01:14:41.309
No, no, no!

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:45.680
No! Don't let me die like this!
Please!

01:14:45.681 --> 01:14:47.024
Please!

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:50.092
Don't let me die...!

01:14:52.754 --> 01:14:56.201
Please have mercy!
Please!

01:15:02.831 --> 01:15:07.075
Don't let me die like this!
Please!

01:16:10.732 --> 01:16:11.399
Yeah.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:12.967
Yo, I tracked down the manager.

01:16:12.968 --> 01:16:13.801
What manager?

01:16:13.802 --> 01:16:15.475
From the bone yard.

01:16:16.471 --> 01:16:17.738
I thought it was closed today.

01:16:17.739 --> 01:16:19.006
He's gonna be here in 15.

01:16:19.007 --> 01:16:21.375
Says he's needs to feed
some fish or some shit-.

01:16:21.376 --> 01:16:23.444
I can meet him alone,
if you're busy.

01:16:23.445 --> 01:16:25.746
No.
No, I'll be there.

01:16:25.747 --> 01:16:27.148
All right.

01:16:27.149 --> 01:16:28.355
Fuck!

01:16:31.386 --> 01:16:32.558
Fuck!

01:16:50.906 --> 01:16:52.840
I need to send this package.

01:16:52.841 --> 01:16:54.842
But I gotta take care
of something I didn't count on.--...

01:16:54.843 --> 01:16:57.346
so can you send it for me?

01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:02.385
Yeah.

01:17:02.784 --> 01:17:03.851
What is it?

01:17:03.852 --> 01:17:05.052
You don't need to know what it is.

01:17:05.053 --> 01:17:06.828
I need to know what it is.

01:17:08.557 --> 01:17:10.059
What is it?

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:12.560
It's a video.

01:17:12.561 --> 01:17:14.729
It's one of the Albanians,
saying something I need him to say...

01:17:14.730 --> 01:17:16.564
to the person I need him to say it to.

01:17:16.565 --> 01:17:17.566
All right?

01:17:18.634 --> 01:17:19.806
Okay-

01:17:20.602 --> 01:17:23.270
You need lo gel a tracking number.

01:17:23.271 --> 01:17:25.251
With alerts lo my cell phone.

01:17:27.209 --> 01:17:28.381
Yeah.

01:17:29.611 --> 01:17:31.056
Thanks.

01:17:36.284 --> 01:17:37.729
Wait.

01:17:42.090 --> 01:17:44.558
Tell your mother
it was very good.

01:17:44.559 --> 01:17:45.594
Yeah?

01:17:46.028 --> 01:17:47.939
It's not too salty?

01:17:48.296 --> 01:17:49.604
No.

01:17:50.032 --> 01:17:51.943
It was perfect.

01:18:13.855 --> 01:18:15.892
Hey, this shit's coming together-.

01:18:16.258 --> 01:18:18.101
Paul was definitely here.

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:19.360
How'd you know he was here?

01:18:19.361 --> 01:18:20.431
The manager.

01:18:20.862 --> 01:18:22.364
He asked for this.

01:18:22.664 --> 01:18:24.905
It's a list
of all the people buried here.

01:18:25.333 --> 01:18:29.440
The guy said he was interested
in the Hungarian section.

01:18:29.838 --> 01:18:32.751
The Hungarian section.
Did he say why?

01:18:32.974 --> 01:18:33.952
No.

01:18:35.010 --> 01:18:37.047
There's hundreds of them.

01:18:54.062 --> 01:18:56.099
What happened to that girl?

01:18:57.599 --> 01:19:00.808
That girl you told me
about across the way from you.

01:19:00.902 --> 01:19:02.472
You ever meet her?

01:19:02.971 --> 01:19:05.508
Yeah. I met her.

01:19:06.808 --> 01:19:08.617
And?

01:19:14.249 --> 01:19:17.492
You didn't die two years ago.

01:19:26.094 --> 01:19:28.597
They found the cemetery.

01:19:30.899 --> 01:19:33.277
They're getting close.

01:19:40.742 --> 01:19:42.877
The one
who found you before got lucky.

01:19:42.878 --> 01:19:45.246
And just because
he found the grave...

01:19:45.247 --> 01:19:48.524
doesn't mean
that they will figure it out as well.

01:19:49.184 --> 01:19:51.687
You can walk away still.

01:19:52.087 --> 01:19:53.794
Not loo late.

01:19:55.257 --> 01:19:59.660
I know why
you've been wailing so long.

01:19:59.661 --> 01:20:02.164
Why you haven't killed him.

01:20:02.731 --> 01:20:07.009
I think you're afraid
that when it's over...

01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:10.115
it won't mend your heart.

01:20:37.132 --> 01:20:38.999
It was going lo waste.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.504
I just felt like putting it on.

01:20:53.715 --> 01:20:54.849
<i>- Okay, lets go.
- Hey, monster!</i>

01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:56.056
Hey!

01:21:13.335 --> 01:21:14.575
What happened?

01:21:16.504 --> 01:21:18.211
I fall.

01:21:18.473 --> 01:21:20.074
And ruined a nice dress.

01:21:20.075 --> 01:21:21.452
Let's see.

01:21:24.079 --> 01:21:25.717
You okay?

01:21:28.216 --> 01:21:31.322
At least
it wasn't on my good side.

01:21:34.956 --> 01:21:36.891
I sent your package.

01:21:36.892 --> 01:21:39.236
I have your tracking number.

01:21:39.794 --> 01:21:41.061
Thank you.

01:21:41.062 --> 01:21:42.162
Hello, Victor.

01:21:42.163 --> 01:21:42.868
Hello.

01:21:54.242 --> 01:21:55.976
Thank you
for returning my Tupperware.

01:21:55.977 --> 01:21:57.077
Of course.

01:21:57.078 --> 01:22:01.615
People usually don't.
Like it comes with the food.

01:22:01.616 --> 01:22:03.493
Free Tupperware.

01:22:04.052 --> 01:22:06.453
Did you like the food?

01:22:06.454 --> 01:22:09.723
Yeah.
The food was... very good.

01:22:09.724 --> 01:22:11.458
Beatrice didn't tell you?

01:22:11.459 --> 01:22:14.440
She was nervous
you wouldn't like her cooking.

01:22:20.602 --> 01:22:21.802
I always told her...

01:22:21.803 --> 01:22:25.012
the way to a man's heart
is through his stomach.

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:27.842
Well all the way.

01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:31.250
She'll keep you well fed.
That's for sure.

01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:46.593
You know, this thing..-
me falling and hitting my head?

01:22:46.594 --> 01:22:50.974
Maybe it happened
because I lost my rabbit's foot.

01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:57.738
The truth is my morn gave it to me
after the accident-.

01:22:57.739 --> 01:23:01.346
She said it was going to bring me luck
with my procedures.

01:23:02.444 --> 01:23:05.112
I picked the color.

01:23:05.113 --> 01:23:07.115
Stupid chartreuse.

01:23:15.623 --> 01:23:16.863
<i>HEY-</i>

01:23:19.594 --> 01:23:21.835
Would you go out
with me tonight?

01:23:24.733 --> 01:23:26.713
Somewhere.

01:23:27.736 --> 01:23:29.647
Anywhere.

01:23:30.605 --> 01:23:32.516
Yeah.

01:23:32.774 --> 01:23:34.276
Okay-

01:24:30.565 --> 01:24:31.365
Yeah.

01:24:31.366 --> 01:24:33.004
<i>Laszlo Kerik.</i>

01:24:35.203 --> 01:24:37.911
Laszlo Kerik?
Do you know the name?

01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:41.141
No.
No, I don't know him.

01:24:41.142 --> 01:24:42.242
I didn't think you would.

01:24:42.243 --> 01:24:46.046
I've been searching every dead
Hungarian on this cemetery list.

01:24:46.047 --> 01:24:49.950
This went down nine months
before we were on the crew.

01:24:49.951 --> 01:24:53.020
<i>There was a court</i> case
<i>involving Alphonse and</i> a <i>little girl...</i>

01:24:53.021 --> 01:24:55.656
<i>who was killed
in one of his buildings.</i>

01:24:55.657 --> 01:24:57.891
<i>The case never went to trial.
Get this, right?</i>

01:24:57.892 --> 01:25:00.127
The little girl's
mommy and daddy...

01:25:00.128 --> 01:25:01.662
They died
like two months afterwards.

01:25:01.663 --> 01:25:03.939
They're buried
right there next lo her.

01:25:07.902 --> 01:25:09.142
<i>Vic?</i>

01:25:10.171 --> 01:25:11.741
You there?
Vic?

01:25:11.906 --> 01:25:13.442
<i>Vic?</i>

01:25:13.708 --> 01:25:14.975
Yeah. I'm here.

01:25:14.976 --> 01:25:15.909
<i>I did it, man.</i>

01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:17.478
I fucking did it.

01:25:17.479 --> 01:25:20.447
I found out exactly
what Paul must have found out.

01:25:20.448 --> 01:25:23.383
<i>I want to tell Alphonse.
I want you to he there when I tell him.</i>

01:25:23.384 --> 01:25:25.252
<i>Can you get there?</i>

01:25:25.253 --> 01:25:28.325
No, I'm in the middle of something.
I'll talk to you later.

01:25:55.183 --> 01:25:57.251
Oh, Victor.

01:25:57.252 --> 01:26:00.721
I didn't know you were coming.
I would have thrown something on.

01:26:00.722 --> 01:26:02.929
Maman,
you knew very well he was coming.

01:26:03.658 --> 01:26:05.569
Well, I told you so.

01:26:08.029 --> 01:26:09.736
Ready?

01:26:17.805 --> 01:26:19.910
So...uh...

01:26:20.942 --> 01:26:22.676
Where are we going?

01:26:22.677 --> 01:26:23.917
You'll see.

01:26:26.581 --> 01:26:28.083
A club?

01:26:28.616 --> 01:26:30.118
Very cold.

01:26:31.819 --> 01:26:33.264
A Park?

01:26:39.427 --> 01:26:40.827
Are you okay?

01:26:40.828 --> 01:26:43.001
Yeah.
Good.

01:27:00.315 --> 01:27:01.048
This is...

01:27:01.049 --> 01:27:01.925
The bar.

01:27:03.151 --> 01:27:05.419
In his house,
some credit card receipts.

01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:07.321
He usually leaves the bar
at 8:30 every night.

01:27:07.322 --> 01:27:08.855
He look a trip.

01:27:08.856 --> 01:27:10.857
I want lo make sure he's back.

01:27:10.858 --> 01:27:14.135
If he's here tonight,
he'll probably be here tomorrow night.

01:27:20.835 --> 01:27:22.610
I'm prepared to do it then.

01:27:34.882 --> 01:27:36.520
L-q-

01:27:37.518 --> 01:27:41.227
I've found a moment... with you.

01:27:45.059 --> 01:27:47.630
I want lo hang onto it.

01:27:51.666 --> 01:27:53.771
It's not gonna end up that way.

01:27:57.939 --> 01:28:00.112
I never said it would.

01:28:00.441 --> 01:28:02.421
Not with words.

01:28:12.287 --> 01:28:15.530
I wore that white dress for you.

01:28:17.158 --> 01:28:19.069
Was that a mistake?

01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:30.347
Yes.

01:28:42.383 --> 01:28:43.917
Wail here.

01:28:43.918 --> 01:28:45.659
I'll be back in a minute.

01:29:59.894 --> 01:30:01.396
What did you do?

01:30:01.896 --> 01:30:03.204
Here.

01:30:05.333 --> 01:30:07.108
It's done.

01:30:08.169 --> 01:30:09.409
It's done.

01:31:15.603 --> 01:31:17.173
Nope.

01:31:20.208 --> 01:31:23.052
Hold up.
Oh, it's this one.

01:31:26.214 --> 01:31:28.081
So you're saying
it's someone who knew them?

01:31:28.082 --> 01:31:29.749
He must have.

01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:31.696
Cause this guy's dead, right?

01:31:35.156 --> 01:31:36.464
Right?

01:31:39.727 --> 01:31:41.104
What is it?

01:31:41.829 --> 01:31:45.276
The little girl died June 17th.

01:31:45.633 --> 01:31:47.476
Two years ago. Right?

01:31:48.236 --> 01:31:49.874
Yeah.

01:31:50.505 --> 01:31:53.213
June 17th is tomorrow.

01:32:26.107 --> 01:32:27.882
Beatrice!

01:32:28.509 --> 01:32:30.147
What are you doing?

01:32:30.711 --> 01:32:32.088
Huh?

01:32:35.783 --> 01:32:37.317
0h, my God!

01:32:37.318 --> 01:32:37.984
Beatrice.

01:32:37.985 --> 01:32:40.487
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

01:32:40.488 --> 01:32:43.367
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:32:57.738 --> 01:32:59.940
Yeah,
I'm walking back to him now.

01:32:59.941 --> 01:33:00.976
Okay-

01:33:06.881 --> 01:33:08.081
Yeah.

01:33:08.082 --> 01:33:10.083
<i>Hey, you know who this is?
Right?</i>

01:33:10.084 --> 01:33:11.685
Yeah, I know who it is.

01:33:11.686 --> 01:33:15.188
I've been getting these weird letters
for the past three months.

01:33:15.189 --> 01:33:17.424
With pictures?
With the eyes crossed out?

01:33:17.425 --> 01:33:18.836
<i>We been getting them too.</i>

01:33:18.926 --> 01:33:21.270
Whoever is doing it took my brother.

01:33:26.133 --> 01:33:28.773
You remember this...

01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:32.444
problem I had
you take care of for me?

01:33:33.274 --> 01:33:35.311
<i>Hungarian Rhapsody?</i>

01:33:35.576 --> 01:33:37.978
You stayed lo the finale.
Right?

01:33:37.979 --> 01:33:39.151
Yeah.

01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:42.115
<i>The whole family took a bow?</i>

01:33:42.116 --> 01:33:43.249
Yeah.

01:33:43.250 --> 01:33:46.459
And you're sure
you saw the father take a bow?

01:33:48.923 --> 01:33:51.658
<i>Where the fuck have you been?
We been trying to call you.</i>

01:33:51.659 --> 01:33:52.993
My car won't start.

01:33:52.994 --> 01:33:54.961
Some shit's going down, man.

01:33:54.962 --> 01:33:55.895
<i>The fucking thing won't start.</i>

01:33:55.896 --> 01:33:57.705
What am I gonna tell you?

01:33:58.499 --> 01:33:59.432
Come pick me up.

01:33:59.433 --> 01:34:00.878
What?

01:34:23.224 --> 01:34:24.532
Ilir...?

01:34:25.393 --> 01:34:26.497
Brozi?

01:34:26.594 --> 01:34:27.834
Here?

01:34:37.938 --> 01:34:39.781
Delivery Confirmation

01:35:54.882 --> 01:35:59.456
he is still alive
Maybe more moments - Laszlo

01:36:23.377 --> 01:36:24.822
Vic!

01:37:01.749 --> 01:37:03.283
You didn't mail the package.

01:37:03.284 --> 01:37:04.820
You didn't kill him-.

01:37:06.020 --> 01:37:09.729
You didn't kill him
because you feel something for me.

01:37:10.424 --> 01:37:13.226
You knew how I would feel.

01:37:13.227 --> 01:37:14.694
You didn't mail
the package.

01:37:14.695 --> 01:37:16.229
I tried.

01:37:16.230 --> 01:37:19.666
And the guy walked away,
and I called him back.

01:37:19.667 --> 01:37:23.843
I called him back,
because I feel something for you.

01:37:28.209 --> 01:37:30.450
I could love you.

01:37:36.116 --> 01:37:37.851
I don't want you to die.

01:37:37.852 --> 01:37:42.155
So I thought if I could just mess up
one of your things, just one thing...

01:37:42.156 --> 01:37:45.831
it would be enough
so it wouldn't work out the way you planned.

01:37:48.095 --> 01:37:52.066
So I put my rabbit's foot
in that package.

01:37:52.867 --> 01:37:55.245
And I took
the video card out.

01:37:55.870 --> 01:37:58.783
They got
my rabbit's foot instead.

01:38:04.278 --> 01:38:06.121
We can run away.

01:38:06.914 --> 01:38:08.448
They'd find us.

01:38:08.449 --> 01:38:09.951
We'd keep on running.

01:38:10.150 --> 01:38:14.189
We'd travel by night.
I don't care how far we have to go.

01:38:14.822 --> 01:38:16.199
Vic?

01:38:18.125 --> 01:38:19.832
What.._? Shit.-.

01:39:22.056 --> 01:39:23.160
Laszlo.

01:39:24.224 --> 01:39:25.558
Fucking Laszlo.

01:39:25.559 --> 01:39:27.505
I'm gonna wail for you here.

01:39:27.795 --> 01:39:29.262
Where are you?

01:39:29.263 --> 01:39:31.531
I'm outside your apartment.
Come back. Please.

01:39:31.532 --> 01:39:33.766
Beatrice,
I want you to go to your apartment now.

01:39:33.767 --> 01:39:34.400
Go there now...

01:39:34.401 --> 01:39:36.642
and slay there and wait for me.
Okay.

01:39:39.573 --> 01:39:41.075
Come back!

01:39:43.978 --> 01:39:45.778
If you fucking scream,
it will go bad!

01:39:45.779 --> 01:39:46.553
Okay?

01:39:47.047 --> 01:39:47.889
<i>Okay?</i>

01:39:51.452 --> 01:39:54.520
Laszlo fucking Kerik.

01:39:54.521 --> 01:39:56.856
<i>You made me a douche,
Laszlo Kerik.</i>

01:39:56.857 --> 01:39:58.491
<i>I've seen your artwork.</i>

01:39:58.492 --> 01:40:00.760
I've seen your fucking pictures.

01:40:00.761 --> 01:40:02.762
You put Paul in the freezer.

01:40:02.763 --> 01:40:04.764
This has nothing to do with you.

01:40:04.765 --> 01:40:06.532
I sent you
to my apartment to save you.

01:40:06.533 --> 01:40:07.333
All right.

01:40:07.334 --> 01:40:08.234
You weren't supposed to go inside.

01:40:08.235 --> 01:40:10.303
Yeah, but I did go inside.

01:40:10.304 --> 01:40:12.338
I was worried about you.

01:40:12.339 --> 01:40:14.107
I don't want to fucking kill you.

01:40:14.108 --> 01:40:16.909
Take this opportunity,
and you let her go.

01:40:16.910 --> 01:40:18.211
You lied to me.

01:40:18.212 --> 01:40:19.979
You fucking lied to me.

01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:22.315
The godfather of my son.

01:40:22.316 --> 01:40:24.384
Let her go. Let her go-.

01:40:24.385 --> 01:40:25.551
You listen to me.

01:40:25.552 --> 01:40:27.820
You get in your shitty car
that does start.

01:40:27.821 --> 01:40:29.389
You start your shitty car.

01:40:29.390 --> 01:40:32.325
And you drive
your shitty car to Alphonse's.

01:40:32.326 --> 01:40:33.960
We'll be waiting.

01:40:33.961 --> 01:40:35.338

01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:38.032

01:41:15.469 --> 01:41:17.244
