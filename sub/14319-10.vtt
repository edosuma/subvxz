Right!
What is this place?

14:02.875 --> 14:05.583
We are the
Friends of Humanity.

14:05.583 --> 14:08.208
We believe that mutants
have their place.

14:08.208 --> 14:13.208
It's just not here with us,
if you know what I mean.

14:13.208 --> 14:16.875
Extermination?
Like the rats they are?

14:16.875 --> 14:20.458
Well, you'll never hear me
say that in public.

14:20.458 --> 14:23.333
Say, you look familiar to me.

14:23.333 --> 14:25.416
-Oh?
-Yeah.

14:25.416 --> 14:28.958
I knew a guy
about 20 years ago
by the name of Creed.

14:28.958 --> 14:30.875
Could've been
your old man.

14:30.875 --> 14:32.625
-Really?
-Yeah.

14:32.625 --> 14:34.458
Working coal mines in Kentucky.

14:34.458 --> 14:37.958
Oh! That couldn't have
been my family.

14:37.958 --> 14:40.000
We were all in Canada then.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
So was I, bub. So was I.

14:45.625 --> 14:47.625
Hello, Cyclops?
This is Beast.

14:47.625 --> 14:49.625
We're here, Beast.
What's up?

14:49.625 --> 14:52.375
The Friends of Humanity
kidnapped Carly.
I need assistance.

14:52.375 --> 14:55.000
Jean and Jubilee
are here with me.
We're ready to help!

14:55.000 --> 14:58.125
BEAST: Jubilee, where was
the FOH headquarters
Morph sent you to?

14:58.125 --> 15:00.000
JUBILEE:
It's the abandoned
Veteran's building.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.416
Meet me there!

15:04.458 --> 15:06.000
Let's go.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.875
WOLVERINE ON RADIO:
Hey! War room!

15:07.875 --> 15:10.208
Can anybody hear me?

15:10.208 --> 15:12.000
Where are you,
Wolverine?

15:12.000 --> 15:15.875
I'm babysitting a bunch of
mutant-hating gutter trash.

15:15.875 --> 15:18.166
If you want them alive,

15:18.166 --> 15:21.166
get everybody down here
to the old Veteran's
building right away.

15:21.166 --> 15:23.250
Beast is almost there,
and we're on our way.

15:23.250 --> 15:25.416
Beast thinks they're holding
a young woman he knows.

15:25.416 --> 15:30.416
Beast has a girl?
Well, well, will wonders
never cease.

15:30.416 --> 15:32.583
Don't worry,
I'll find her.

15:32.583 --> 15:37.000
And listen, I need
the portable Cerebro
projector and a file disk

15:37.000 --> 15:39.208
on an old buddy of mine.

15:39.208 --> 15:43.458
So, how long
have you known
this Dr. McCoy?

15:43.458 --> 15:45.291
You bigot!

15:45.291 --> 15:48.458
I don't need to answer
any of your questions!

15:48.458 --> 15:51.458
I understand
he was your doctor.

15:51.458 --> 15:53.875
But he's more than that,
isn't he?

15:53.875 --> 15:56.625
You're more than friends,
aren't you?

15:56.625 --> 15:58.458
Leave me alone!

15:58.458 --> 16:01.000
Don't you know what monsters
they are?

16:01.000 --> 16:03.250
They're evil! All of them!

16:03.250 --> 16:07.000
They and all
who associate with them
must be exterminated!

16:19.708 --> 16:23.958
(MEN GRUNTING)

16:23.958 --> 16:25.208
Come on!

16:27.500 --> 16:31.625
Hey, fellas! Where's Creed?
I have a couple
of questions for him.

16:31.625 --> 16:33.083
He's busy.

16:35.458 --> 16:37.750
(BEAST ROARING)

16:37.750 --> 16:40.583
MAN ON PA: Intruder on 4!
All security report!
Intruder on 4!

16:42.458 --> 16:44.500
Isn't that nice?

16:44.500 --> 16:48.750
Looks like my new friends
will get to meet
some of my old friends.

16:55.583 --> 16:57.000
No!

16:57.000 --> 16:58.500
What are you doing here?

16:58.500 --> 17:00.583
New members
aren't allowed in here!

17:00.583 --> 17:02.875
Let the girl go, Creed.

17:02.875 --> 17:07.000
How dare you?
You have no right to...

17:07.000 --> 17:09.875
These give me
plenty of rights.

17:09.875 --> 17:11.708
You... You're a...

17:15.333 --> 17:19.583
Stay back,
you mutant garbage!

17:19.583 --> 17:21.458
What's the matter, Creed?

17:21.458 --> 17:24.875
Daddy's boy
doesn't like claws?

17:26.458 --> 17:28.708
(STAMMERS)
I don't know what
you're talking about.

17:28.708 --> 17:30.250
Oh.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.708
I don't have a familiar
look to you?

17:32.708 --> 17:34.000
Shut up! Shut up!

17:34.000 --> 17:36.166
MAN: Mr. Creed!

17:36.166 --> 17:38.708
That mutant from
the hospital broke in!
He's busted up half the men!

17:45.833 --> 17:47.333
Who are you?

17:47.333 --> 17:49.000
Just say
Hank sent me.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.583
(WEAKLY) Carly!

17:53.583 --> 17:55.583
Hank!

17:55.583 --> 17:58.875
Look, this is all
very touching, but we
gotta get out of here.

17:59.958 --> 18:03.083
(WOLVERINE GRUNTING)

18:03.083 --> 18:08.125
Beast, you gotta
cut down on those
snacks, pal. Come on!

18:13.583 --> 18:15.208
WOLVERINE: Uh-oh.

18:15.208 --> 18:17.125
Looks like we took
a wrong turn.

18:17.125 --> 18:19.958
CREED: Well, Mr. Logan.

18:19.958 --> 18:23.500
Since you hate
mutants so much,

18:23.500 --> 18:28.375
I think I'll let you watch while
I put one out of his misery!

18:28.375 --> 18:30.291
No!

18:30.291 --> 18:34.250
Not until I take
a few of you joy boys
along with us.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.083
I'd still like to know
what Wolverine
wants with a hologram.

18:40.083 --> 18:45.375
Weird, Wolverine
using his head and
Beast going berserk.

18:45.375 --> 18:48.458
What's the world
coming to? Got it!

18:51.625 --> 18:53.250
(SABRETOOTH GROWLING)

18:53.250 --> 18:55.083
MAN ON CEREBRO:
The mutant Sabretooth.

18:55.083 --> 18:57.625
Last seen in the Baffin Island
region of Canada.

18:57.625 --> 19:00.583
No! Get it away!
Turn it off!

19:00.583 --> 19:02.875
Stay away from me!

19:07.166 --> 19:09.875
MAN ON CEREBRO:
Home: Edmonton, Alberta.
Real name...

19:09.875 --> 19:11.250
No!

19:12.500 --> 19:14.583
...Graydon Creed,
Senior.

19:14.583 --> 19:17.750
Graydon Creed, Senior?

19:17.750 --> 19:20.166
Like father, like son.

19:20.166 --> 19:25.333
What are you looking at?
I hate him!
I'm not like him!

19:25.333 --> 19:30.291
I'm normal!
Get out of here! All of you!

19:30.291 --> 19:33.750
I'm not like him! I'm normal!

19:33.750 --> 19:36.083
I'm not like him!

19:36.083 --> 19:39.500
You are not my father!
You are not my father!

19:39.500 --> 19:44.333
You are not
my father!

19:46.458 --> 19:48.208
Scratch one friend!

19:49.416 --> 19:52.125
Now that you see
what my life
is like,

19:52.125 --> 19:54.833
I hope you will
understand what
I have to tell you.

19:54.833 --> 19:56.708
Hank, please don't...

19:56.708 --> 19:58.625
We have to face it.

19:58.625 --> 20:03.375
I am a mutant in a world
that fears
and despises my kind.

20:03.375 --> 20:06.416
I thought for a moment
we could live
in that world together,

20:06.416 --> 20:09.125
but I know now
that we cannot.

20:09.125 --> 20:13.458
Someday, with work and hope,
the world will change.

20:13.458 --> 20:18.208
Until then, if you care for me
as much as I care for you,

20:18.208 --> 20:20.458
you'll understand
why we must part.

20:24.333 --> 20:26.750
Carry my love with you always.

20:27.875 --> 20:30.000
Honey! I'm so glad
you're all right.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.708
I will be.

20:31.708 --> 20:35.875
As for you, how can I ever
thank you, Dr. McCoy?

20:35.875 --> 20:37.458
This is a beginning.
