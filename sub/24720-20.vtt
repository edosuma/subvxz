Previously on Elementary:
My name's Michael.

00:02.500 --> 00:03.500
HOLMES:A man approached me

00:03.500 --> 00:05.080
at a meeting yesterday.
Apparently,

00:05.080 --> 00:06.910
I helped him once
when I described how integral

00:06.910 --> 00:09.790
my work was to maintaining
my sobriety.

00:09.790 --> 00:10.830
There's this girl I know

00:10.830 --> 00:12.080
from the program.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.160
I'm worried about her.

00:13.160 --> 00:14.330
You want me to look for her?

00:14.330 --> 00:16.490
I thought it might help you to.

00:16.490 --> 00:17.580
It's like there's...

00:17.580 --> 00:19.950
nothing I can do
to get his attention.

00:19.950 --> 00:21.160
I need to get louder.

00:21.160 --> 00:23.080
I'm going to make sure
my friend hears me.

00:23.080 --> 00:25.250
This man caught me
in a moment of weakness.

00:25.250 --> 00:28.490
I am not going to let him
take another life.

00:28.490 --> 00:32.490
It's not the work that
motivates you to stay clean.

00:32.490 --> 00:33.490
Like, when you
kick heroin,

00:33.490 --> 00:35.870
you wonder if you'll ever
have that feeling again.

00:35.870 --> 00:38.910
That itch that you
can't wait to scratch.

00:38.910 --> 00:40.790
That's what those women were
for me.

00:40.790 --> 00:42.500
(over phone):
I've already left New York.

00:42.500 --> 00:45.620
I'm going to go away
for a while, but...

00:45.620 --> 00:47.870
I'll be back.

01:03.200 --> 01:07.330
(music playing in Spanish)

01:08.490 --> 01:09.490
Good news, Watson.

01:09.490 --> 01:11.080
You can clear all this up.

01:11.080 --> 01:12.200
You solved it?

01:12.200 --> 01:13.120
The pilot was murdered.

01:13.120 --> 01:15.250
The crash was not caused
by operator error.

01:15.250 --> 01:16.830
The FAA owes me an apology.

01:16.830 --> 01:19.870
Or at least reimbursement
for hauling all this up here.

01:19.870 --> 01:21.330
So, what was the
breakthrough?

01:21.330 --> 01:23.330
Did you find the killer's
parachute?

01:23.330 --> 01:24.040
Nope.

01:24.040 --> 01:25.660
Our theory was wrong.

01:25.660 --> 01:26.750
No one survived
the crash.

01:26.750 --> 01:29.790
Not Andy Donovan,
the right-wing extremist pilot,

01:29.790 --> 01:31.330
and not Gio Gutierrez,

01:31.330 --> 01:32.620
the man who
stabbed him to death.

01:32.620 --> 01:36.790
Is this just confusing because
I haven't had my coffee yet?

01:36.790 --> 01:39.040
Donovan was stabbed.
I was right about that.

01:39.040 --> 01:40.490
The FAA's contention
that the crash caused

01:40.490 --> 01:41.620
the puncture wounds
to his chest

01:41.620 --> 01:43.790
was always absurd--
too much blood in the cockpit.

01:43.790 --> 01:45.370
But there's a reason
you couldn't find

01:45.370 --> 01:47.120
the murder weapon
in all of this wreckage.

01:47.120 --> 01:48.700
It's at the bottom
of the Atlantic.

01:48.700 --> 01:50.490
And you think this guy did it?

01:50.490 --> 01:52.500
Gio Gutierrez
was a sociology professor.

01:52.500 --> 01:54.660
I saw a news bulletin
last night.

01:54.660 --> 01:55.830
A Good Samaritan
found his wallet

01:55.830 --> 01:57.620
washed up on the beach.
Tried to return it,

01:57.620 --> 01:59.250
but Mr. Gutierrez
was nowhere to be found.

01:59.250 --> 02:01.580
Turns out he hasn't been seen
since last Friday.

02:01.580 --> 02:02.790
The day of the crash.

02:02.790 --> 02:05.790
But why would he have been
in a helicopter with...

02:05.790 --> 02:07.830
Gutierrez was a Communist,
Watson.

02:07.830 --> 02:09.410
He identified as such

02:09.410 --> 02:11.200
on social media.

02:11.450 --> 02:13.040
Are you really not
seeing the connection?

02:13.040 --> 02:14.910
Even with the musical clue?

02:15.490 --> 02:16.540
It's a Chilean classic,

02:16.540 --> 02:18.490
recently reappropriated
as a tribute

02:18.490 --> 02:20.290
to General Augusto Pinochet.

02:20.290 --> 02:23.490
Helicopter rides were
Pinochet's preferred method

02:23.490 --> 02:25.450
of executing Communists.

02:25.450 --> 02:26.700
His Caravana de la Muerte

02:26.700 --> 02:29.490
would drop dissidents
from great heights.

02:29.490 --> 02:30.790
Gutierrez was once threatened

02:30.790 --> 02:33.490
with the Pinochet treatment
in an e-mail.

02:33.490 --> 02:36.490
The account was private,
but the IP address...

02:36.490 --> 02:37.790
Was Donovan's.

02:37.790 --> 02:39.200
So Gutierrez
either jumps

02:39.200 --> 02:40.580
or is thrown out
of the helicopter.

02:40.580 --> 02:42.250
Donovan bleeds out
before he can

02:42.250 --> 02:43.490
make a safe landing,
and crashes.

02:43.490 --> 02:45.870
Thus completing the first
Nazi-Communist double murder

02:45.870 --> 02:46.870
since World War Two.

02:46.870 --> 02:48.580
Case closed.
(music stops)

02:48.580 --> 02:49.750
(sighing):
Okay.

02:49.750 --> 02:52.040
Well, are you gonna help me
clean this up?

02:52.040 --> 02:54.830

No, I haven't touched a thing.
Anybody else been in here?

03:27.040 --> 03:29.250
Sir, you need to get back.
HOLMES: No, I'm a
consulting detective.

03:29.250 --> 03:31.540
This is a crime scene.
It's off limits.
If you call Captain Gregson

03:31.540 --> 03:34.490
at the 11th Precinct...
Hey. It's okay.
I know him.

03:34.490 --> 03:35.620
Thank you.

03:35.620 --> 03:36.490
You were saying?

03:36.490 --> 03:38.540
They use this room for
support group meetings.

03:38.540 --> 03:40.700
No security cameras
down here or upstairs.

03:40.700 --> 03:41.790
First guy who showed up,

03:41.790 --> 03:43.330
he found the body
and called it in.

03:43.330 --> 03:45.290
Did you check with
the staff upstairs?

03:45.290 --> 03:45.950
Any witnesses?

03:45.950 --> 03:47.660
Sounds like the perp
got in and out

03:47.660 --> 03:49.000
without anyone
seeing him.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.490
Actually, his entire purpose
was to be seen.

03:52.490 --> 03:53.950

03:54.490 --> 03:56.790
I know who did this.

Wallet, keys and cell phone
are all here.

04:33.790 --> 04:34.790
She's fully accessorized.

04:34.790 --> 04:36.250
Nothing obvious missing
from her outfit.

04:36.250 --> 04:39.000
If I had to guess, he did not
take a trophy this time.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.790
He put himself
in our crosshairs for a reason.

04:40.790 --> 04:43.050
But he doesn't want
to make it too easy for us

04:43.050 --> 04:45.000
to be able to tie him
to this woman.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.050
That would defeat the purpose.

04:46.050 --> 04:47.800
Still trying
to contact the family,

a hold of someone

04:49.800 --> 04:51.790

contact list.

04:51.790 --> 04:56.130
Ms. Garner was a junior analyst
at a hedge fund downtown.

04:56.130 --> 04:57.210
Mills Blakney Capital.

04:57.210 --> 04:59.050
She lived alone in Midtown.

04:59.050 --> 05:00.710
So, high-security
building?

05:00.710 --> 05:02.000
Yeah, we're gonna

05:02.000 --> 05:03.210

a safe bet

05:03.210 --> 05:04.750
that he scooped her up
somewhere else.

05:04.750 --> 05:06.460
WATSON: Hmm. She was dressed
for a night out.

05:06.460 --> 05:08.630
GREGSON: Yeah, he probably
picked her up in a bar.

05:08.630 --> 05:11.340
MLI is putting time of death

05:13.130 --> 05:14.790
No. No prints.

05:14.790 --> 05:17.130
None on the chair.
It was wiped down.

No signs of a struggle,
either, so I don't think

05:19.920 --> 05:20.920
this is where he killed her.

05:20.920 --> 05:23.500
I think this is just
where he left her.

05:23.500 --> 05:24.790
We got nothing.

05:24.790 --> 05:26.050
We have Baquacil.

05:26.050 --> 05:27.380
What's that?
It's a chemical,

05:27.380 --> 05:28.800
uh, used for sanitizing
swimming pools.

05:28.800 --> 05:31.840
It's not as common
as chlorine or salt, but, uh,

05:31.840 --> 05:34.590
there's a faint odor
of it in her hair.

05:34.590 --> 05:36.800
So she went swimming yesterday.

05:36.800 --> 05:38.460
That's about all we got to go on

05:41.590 --> 05:42.960
There won't be
any witnesses.

05:42.960 --> 05:44.170
He's too careful
for that.

05:44.170 --> 05:46.340
And it's easy to just park
in the back lot,

05:46.340 --> 05:47.790
and he could've dragged her
in here.

05:47.790 --> 05:49.670
Lock on the door
has been broken for weeks.

05:49.670 --> 05:51.790

You talk to the staff?

05:51.790 --> 05:56.590
No. This is where I most often
attend meetings.

05:56.590 --> 05:57.920
It's where I met Michael.

05:57.920 --> 06:00.380

06:16.630 --> 06:18.790
I put a call in

06:18.790 --> 06:20.960
I guess we got
our signals crossed.

Ms. Watson.

So you're covering the
Michael Rowan investigation

06:32.790 --> 06:35.090
for the Bureau.
More like "taking point."

06:35.090 --> 06:36.300
Your guy's killed
in three states,

06:36.300 --> 06:38.630
which makes him
the Bureau's responsibility.

06:38.630 --> 06:41.790
Your people have any idea
he was back in town?

06:41.790 --> 06:42.880
No. What about you?

06:42.880 --> 06:44.630
You were gonna post
surveillance units

06:44.630 --> 06:46.170
at his office and his home?

06:46.170 --> 06:47.550
We did. Got nothing.

06:47.550 --> 06:49.790
There was no noise
online, either.

06:49.790 --> 06:52.000
No cellular activity,
no e-mails.

06:52.000 --> 06:52.790
How would you know that?

So are we.

07:00.750 --> 07:02.090
Listen-- don't do that.

07:02.090 --> 07:03.210
Don't even joke about using

07:03.210 --> 07:04.790
extrajudicial methods
on this case.

07:04.790 --> 07:06.790
We're gonna close it clean
and make it stick.

07:06.790 --> 07:08.460
We know he's back now,
and we're gonna find him.

07:08.460 --> 07:10.380
That's something
the Bureau's damn good at.

07:10.380 --> 07:12.420
Oh, good, because by the time
you locate him,

07:12.420 --> 07:14.670
I'll have a case
you can hang him with.

07:14.670 --> 07:16.380
Something I'm good at.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.790
GREGSON: That's my whole point.
Why not reach out to us

07:19.790 --> 07:21.500
before you make that decision?

07:21.500 --> 07:23.000
MALLICK:
I don't know--
maybe because

07:23.000 --> 07:24.250
it's my decision to make.

07:24.250 --> 07:27.300
Doesn't sound like the captain's
making friends in there.

07:27.300 --> 07:28.420
I'm not surprised.

07:28.420 --> 07:31.170
Agent Mallick does not exactly
play well with others.

07:31.170 --> 07:33.300
Doesn't always
follow through, either.

07:33.300 --> 07:35.670
Feds were supposed to be
watching Michael's home

07:35.670 --> 07:36.790
and office round the clock,

07:36.790 --> 07:38.800
but they scaled back
hours last month.

07:38.800 --> 07:40.630
Guess they figured
he was dormant,

07:40.630 --> 07:41.790
surveillance
was expensive...

07:41.790 --> 07:43.630
I doubt they missed anything.

07:43.630 --> 07:46.880
Their penny-pinching cut a hole
in the net over a serial killer.

07:46.880 --> 07:48.300
That doesn't bother you?

07:48.300 --> 07:49.630
It does.
I just don't think Michael

07:49.630 --> 07:51.250
came back to the city
before yesterday.

07:51.250 --> 07:54.550

under the ten-K limit

09:00.790 --> 09:03.920
for withdrawals
that get reported to the IRS?

09:04.420 --> 09:05.790
If Bazemore has been
floating money

09:05.790 --> 09:06.840
to Michael this whole time,

09:06.840 --> 09:08.800
it could explain how he's
been living off the grid

09:08.800 --> 09:11.550
without using banks
or credit cards.

09:11.840 --> 09:13.050
Be nice to go question him,

09:13.050 --> 09:16.670
but the way this tip came in,
FBI's not gonna let us.

09:16.670 --> 09:20.920
Well, then maybe we don't
tell them where we got the idea.

09:20.920 --> 09:22.460
I distinctly
recall saying

09:22.460 --> 09:24.170
I wasn't going
to help you, Miss Watson.

09:24.170 --> 09:26.880
That's funny, 'cause we think
you love to help.

09:26.880 --> 09:28.880
What is that supposed to mean?

09:28.880 --> 09:31.130
Another woman was
strangled last night.

09:31.130 --> 09:32.880
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

09:32.880 --> 09:36.050
But if you think Michael
is responsible, you're crazy.

09:36.050 --> 09:38.790
Miss Watson told me
you don't think he's a killer.

09:38.790 --> 09:43.090
No. I think you're harassing him
because you're prejudiced.

09:43.960 --> 09:46.790
Michael and I are addicts.

09:46.790 --> 09:47.800
Our community--

09:47.800 --> 09:50.460
we try to support one another,
stick together.

09:50.460 --> 09:52.790
But people like you
don't have it in you

09:52.790 --> 09:54.050
to see past our histories.

09:54.050 --> 09:54.800
It's disgusting.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.750
Mr. Bazemore,
if Michael is innocent,

09:56.750 --> 09:59.960
all he has to do is come forward
and alibi himself.

09:59.960 --> 10:02.500
Thing is, we can't find him
anywhere.

10:02.500 --> 10:05.130
As I told Miss Watson
the first time we spoke,

10:05.130 --> 10:07.790
I haven't seen Michael
in almost a year.

10:07.790 --> 10:09.920
Would you like to check
under the couch?

10:09.920 --> 10:12.460
No, but we would like you
to explain a large withdrawal

10:12.460 --> 10:14.880
that you made from
your checking account yesterday.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.750
How do you know about that?

10:16.750 --> 10:19.750
$9,900.
So, a hundred dollars more,

10:19.750 --> 10:21.710
and your bank would
have had to file

10:21.710 --> 10:23.790
a currency transaction report
with the government.

10:23.790 --> 10:26.750
You don't have a warrant.
There's no way...

10:26.750 --> 10:29.050
Was the money for Michael Rowan?

10:29.460 --> 10:30.790
I want you to leave right now.

10:30.790 --> 10:34.300
And I'll tell you what--
if I do see Michael,

10:34.300 --> 10:36.000
I'm not going to call you.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.590
He's killed 14 women.

10:38.590 --> 10:40.460
Are we getting close
to a number

10:40.460 --> 10:41.790
that'll actually
bother you?

10:41.790 --> 10:43.790
You know what? I confess.

10:43.790 --> 10:46.500
I did take out some money
yesterday.

10:46.500 --> 10:48.000
It was for Alba,

10:48.000 --> 10:48.790
my maid.

10:48.790 --> 10:51.090
Her mother is very sick
back in Guatemala.

10:51.090 --> 10:52.790
I wanted to make sure
that she could afford

10:52.790 --> 10:55.710
to take some time off to go
down there and be with her.

10:55.710 --> 10:58.500
And yes, I did stay
under $10,000 for tax purposes.

10:58.500 --> 11:01.880
Here. Let's call her together,
and she can tell you herself.

11:01.880 --> 11:04.790
And then you can get out
of my house.

11:08.710 --> 11:10.550
I take it from the lethargy
of your approach

11:10.550 --> 11:13.250
that things didn't go well
with William Bazemore.

11:13.250 --> 11:15.050
No, they didn't.

11:15.050 --> 11:17.790
It's not like Everyone
to let us down.

11:17.790 --> 11:19.380
It was a good lead.
It just didn't

11:19.380 --> 11:20.590
mean what they thought it would.

11:20.590 --> 11:22.670
The withdrawal
was for Bazemore's maid.

11:22.670 --> 11:23.790
That being said,
he's still

11:23.790 --> 11:26.590
very defensive of Michael,
very loyal.

11:26.590 --> 11:29.750
I think he would help him
if he had the chance.

11:29.750 --> 11:30.790
I'd ask what kind of an imbecile

11:30.790 --> 11:32.420
befriends a serial killer,
but we both know

11:32.420 --> 11:35.500
the answer can be found
in the nearest mirror.

11:35.500 --> 11:37.050
You okay?

11:37.050 --> 11:38.630
No.

11:38.630 --> 11:40.250
This woman's dead because of me.

11:40.250 --> 11:41.500
Sherlock.
I spent an hour

11:41.500 --> 11:44.800
with her mother today,
asking my questions.

11:44.800 --> 11:48.340
She could barely get
the answers out.

11:48.790 --> 11:51.750
I learned nothing but the depth
of my failure.

11:51.750 --> 11:55.130
I should have realized sooner
what Michael really was.

11:55.130 --> 11:58.790
I was a shadow of myself
when he first engaged me,

11:58.790 --> 12:02.790
but now I am restored.

12:03.300 --> 12:06.090
He's made a grave mistake
in returning.

12:06.090 --> 12:08.210
(cell phone rings)

12:09.790 --> 12:11.340
Hello?

12:11.340 --> 12:14.210
Yeah, he's with me right now.

12:15.750 --> 12:17.250
We'll be right there.

12:17.250 --> 12:17.960
He's struck again?

12:17.960 --> 12:22.920
No. We have to get
to the precinct right now.

12:26.300 --> 12:28.250
I'm surprised
the FBI didn't insist

12:28.250 --> 12:29.790
we do this
at Federal Plaza.

12:29.790 --> 12:31.790
Yeah, well, they
aren't really

12:31.790 --> 12:34.130
calling the shots at the moment.

12:34.130 --> 12:36.050
He is.

12:37.130 --> 12:38.460
You said he just showed up here?

12:38.460 --> 12:40.300
About an hour ago.
I would've called you sooner,

12:40.300 --> 12:43.050
but the Feds wanted
first crack at him.

12:43.050 --> 12:44.790
He shut 'em down.

12:44.790 --> 12:47.880
Said he would only talk to you.

12:55.460 --> 12:56.920
You got better.

12:56.920 --> 12:58.460
I can see it.

12:58.460 --> 13:00.590
Good for you.

13:02.290 --> 13:04.050
Right.

13:04.420 --> 13:08.290
Let's, uh, begin at the
beginning, shall we?

13:08.290 --> 13:10.960
How do you choose them?

13:10.960 --> 13:12.840
We haven't seen each other
in a while.

13:12.840 --> 13:15.800
I thought we could begin
with "hello."

13:15.800 --> 13:18.590
Your victims-- have they done
something to offend you

13:18.590 --> 13:21.840
or attract you,
or are they just easy prey?

13:21.840 --> 13:24.590
Will... will any murder
give you your fix?

13:24.590 --> 13:26.290
My fix?
Hmm.

13:26.290 --> 13:27.880
That's how you
described it to me

13:27.880 --> 13:29.130
that night I was in hospital.

13:29.130 --> 13:32.250
Wait, you mean the night
I took you to the hospital?

13:32.250 --> 13:33.630
You were pretty out of it.

13:33.630 --> 13:35.050
Maybe you misunderstood.

13:35.050 --> 13:36.590
No misunderstanding.

13:36.590 --> 13:39.090
You said that killing
these women,

13:39.090 --> 13:41.550
plotting their murders,
it helped you

13:41.550 --> 13:43.290
maintain your sobriety.

13:43.290 --> 13:44.250
Sherlock...

13:44.250 --> 13:47.670
I came here because I saw
what happened in the news,

13:47.670 --> 13:50.800
and I heard you
were looking for me.

13:50.800 --> 13:53.420
And I thought
I should tell you--

13:53.420 --> 13:56.000
I didn't kill Rachel Garner.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.380
I know you've been confused
about me in the past,

13:59.380 --> 14:02.170
so I thought it might help
hearing it from me.

14:02.170 --> 14:04.750
You said you "heard"
we were looking for you.

14:04.750 --> 14:06.460
From whom?

14:07.460 --> 14:10.290
William Bazemore contacted you.

14:10.290 --> 14:12.090
MICHAEL:
He's a good man.

14:12.090 --> 14:14.340
He's just looking out
for a friend.

14:14.340 --> 14:17.290
Let's keep our business
between us.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.090
HOLMES:
Right. Business.

14:19.090 --> 14:22.750
Business, business, business.

14:29.300 --> 14:32.250
MICHAEL:
We've been over this.

14:32.250 --> 14:35.000
People like us
need to look forward.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.550
You have a new case.
Maybe I could help.

14:39.300 --> 14:39.960
Help?

14:39.960 --> 14:42.920
MICHAEL: Yeah, I mean, I used to
be a sounding board for you.

14:42.920 --> 14:44.920
Thought I could be one again.

14:44.920 --> 14:48.550
Help you figure out
who really did this.

14:49.130 --> 14:52.710
Rachel Garner, she was strangled
using rubber tubing.

14:52.710 --> 14:57.170
Very reminiscent of a
heroin addict tying off,

14:57.170 --> 14:58.420
don't you think?

14:58.420 --> 15:01.290
Sure, I could see that.
Yeah.

15:01.290 --> 15:02.750
It's the same M.O. we saw

15:02.750 --> 15:05.250
with Ashley Jenkins
and Maddie Williams.

15:05.250 --> 15:07.290
Ms. Williams
is of particular interest

15:07.290 --> 15:09.920
because her murder
can be tied

15:09.920 --> 15:11.630
to all of these cases.

15:11.630 --> 15:14.170
Polly Kenner. Lauren Crafton.

15:14.170 --> 15:15.880
Nicole Tossani.

15:15.880 --> 15:17.460
Mary Lewis.

15:17.460 --> 15:18.300
Hmm.

15:18.300 --> 15:23.590
I told you, I want to talk
about Rachel Garner.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.880
I'll bet you do.

15:26.420 --> 15:28.590
(chuckles quietly)

15:29.290 --> 15:32.290
I thought you wanted to help.

15:33.840 --> 15:35.170
I can't.

15:35.170 --> 15:36.880
Not if you won't let me.

15:36.880 --> 15:40.920
Well, before you go,
I'd like you to understand...

15:40.920 --> 15:43.050
it's my turn to help you.

15:43.050 --> 15:45.460
Whatever pain it is
that compels you

15:45.460 --> 15:50.380
to take innocent lives,
I'm gonna put you out of it.

15:51.750 --> 15:53.550
The last time we spoke,
I told you

15:53.550 --> 15:56.290
I was going away for a while.

15:57.050 --> 15:58.920
That's over now.

15:58.920 --> 16:01.170
I'm home for good.

16:01.170 --> 16:06.840
So, if you change your mind
about my offer, come see me.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.290
Be like old times.

16:14.710 --> 16:15.630
You pushed too hard.

16:15.630 --> 16:16.920
You should've
kept him talking.

16:16.920 --> 16:18.340
GREGSON:
No. Knocking him off balance

16:18.340 --> 16:19.750
was the only shot we had.

16:19.750 --> 16:23.090
He didn't come here
to hand us an easy win.

16:23.090 --> 16:24.250
Why did he come here?

16:24.250 --> 16:25.090
For a contact high.

16:25.090 --> 16:26.290
He wants to feel the pursuit.

16:26.290 --> 16:27.670
He thinks it's gonna
keep him sharp.

16:27.670 --> 16:30.500
Well, then he's gonna
get what he wants.
(cell phone chiming)

16:30.500 --> 16:31.590
I've got 40 people
on a detail,

16:31.590 --> 16:33.300
and they're gonna be tailing him
everywhere he goes.

16:33.300 --> 16:35.880
That's prudent, but he's not
going to make a mistake

16:35.880 --> 16:37.130
anywhere that we can see him.

16:37.130 --> 16:38.920
We need to be
observing him online.

16:38.920 --> 16:41.090
We need to be inside his home
and his office,

16:41.090 --> 16:42.460
places that he feels
most comfortable.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.290
The last time we went
for a warrant,

16:44.290 --> 16:45.670
the judge turned us down flat.

16:45.670 --> 16:48.290
Said we didn't have enough
to connect him to the murders.

16:48.290 --> 16:50.290
We still don't.
Well, Michael didn't like it

16:50.290 --> 16:52.550
when Sherlock asked him
about William Bazemore.

16:52.550 --> 16:54.800
He can be quite protective
of his friends.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.290
I think it was more than that.

16:56.290 --> 16:59.290
So, Bazemore bought this house
six years ago.

16:59.290 --> 17:01.290
The photos are still
up on the listing.

17:01.290 --> 17:03.290
There's a Jacuzzi
in the backyard.

17:03.290 --> 17:04.380
Am I missing something?

17:04.380 --> 17:05.589
Rachel Garner's hair smelled

17:05.589 --> 17:07.880
like a pool-cleaning chemical,
Baquacil.

17:07.880 --> 17:09.290
GREGSON:
Be nice to know
if that's what

17:09.290 --> 17:10.589
Mr. Bazemore uses
in his hot tub.

17:10.589 --> 17:11.800
WATSON: It would,
but when we left

17:11.800 --> 17:14.000
his house today, he said he
never wanted to see us again,

17:14.000 --> 17:16.050
so there's no way he's
gonna let us take a sample.

17:16.050 --> 17:18.380
I'm confused.
Why did you go see him?

17:18.380 --> 17:20.630
We wrote him off
as a dead end months ago.

17:20.630 --> 17:23.420
Well, obviously, that was
a mistake on the FBI's part.

17:23.420 --> 17:24.880
Michael admitted
they've been in touch.

17:24.880 --> 17:26.290
BELL:
If Mr. Bazemore
won't talk,

17:26.290 --> 17:28.960
maybe his neighbors will.
Joan and I

17:28.960 --> 17:30.290
could go back tomorrow,
ask if anyone's

17:30.290 --> 17:32.420
seen him with Michael
the last few months.

17:32.420 --> 17:34.340
GREGSON:
Could be enough
to get warrants

17:34.340 --> 17:35.880
to search
both guys' places.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.000
You find anything...

17:37.000 --> 17:39.380
You'll be the first to know.

17:39.380 --> 17:40.630
MAN:
She's pretty.

17:40.630 --> 17:42.000
BELL:
Have you seen her?

17:42.000 --> 17:44.460
No, and I think
I'd remember.

17:44.460 --> 17:46.000
I'm between
jobs right now.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.880
Most days, I'm here
working on the car.

17:48.880 --> 17:50.290
What about this man?

17:50.290 --> 17:52.250
Oh, yeah, he's a...

17:52.250 --> 17:53.710
he's a friend of William's.

17:53.710 --> 17:55.130
Mitchell, right?

17:55.130 --> 17:55.710
Michael.

17:55.710 --> 17:57.670
Have you seen him
around recently?

17:57.670 --> 17:58.800
Recently? No.

17:58.800 --> 17:59.920
No, it's been years.

17:59.920 --> 18:02.920
He used to come around a lot
after William's husband passed.

18:02.920 --> 18:05.460
The wife and I thought maybe
he was the new boyfriend,

18:05.460 --> 18:08.840
but then William told us
it wasn't like that.

18:08.840 --> 18:10.460
Ray was William's husband.

18:10.460 --> 18:11.840
They had drug problems,

18:11.840 --> 18:14.290
and both got sober
around the same time

18:14.290 --> 18:16.000
back in the '90s.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.880
Couple years ago,
Ray started to slip.

18:17.880 --> 18:19.630
William got him going
to meetings again,

18:19.630 --> 18:21.340
and that's how
they met Michael.

18:21.340 --> 18:22.630
What's this all about anyway?

18:22.630 --> 18:24.550
Something happen to
him and that girl?

18:24.550 --> 18:26.290
She was murdered
the other night.

18:26.290 --> 18:28.250
He's a person of interest.

18:28.250 --> 18:29.210
You're kidding me.

18:29.210 --> 18:32.420
Well, all I can tell you is
he was very good to William.

18:32.420 --> 18:34.880
Kept him on the straight and
narrow after Ray was gone.

18:34.880 --> 18:38.340
But if I see him,
I promise I'll call 911.

18:38.340 --> 18:41.130
How about you just
call me directly?

18:41.130 --> 18:43.300
WATSON:
Before we go,
Mr. Dwyer,

18:43.300 --> 18:48.090
how exactly
did William's husband die?

18:51.960 --> 18:54.290
(keyless lock beeps)

18:58.420 --> 19:01.460
Good first day back
at the office?

19:06.290 --> 19:07.000
Yeah.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.290
I mean, they didn't throw me
a party or anything,

19:09.290 --> 19:11.710
but it was good
to see everyone.

19:11.710 --> 19:13.880
You know, if you
wanted to apologize,

19:13.880 --> 19:15.290
you could've just called.

19:15.290 --> 19:17.090
Phone call
would've been simpler.

19:17.090 --> 19:19.420
But I wanted to make sure
that we could talk

19:19.420 --> 19:21.340
without anyone listening.

19:21.340 --> 19:22.420
Right.

19:22.420 --> 19:26.290
And I'm sure you would never
record this conversation.

19:26.290 --> 19:29.290
I think you're a monster,
not an idiot.

19:29.290 --> 19:31.290
I'm not recording you.

19:31.290 --> 19:32.710
So, what's on your mind?

19:32.710 --> 19:35.670
Just wanted to make sure you
knew what you were up against.

19:35.670 --> 19:38.750
Me, the police department,
the FBI.

19:38.750 --> 19:41.920
So, if you're thinking
of slipping away again...

19:41.920 --> 19:42.800
I'm a free man.

19:42.800 --> 19:47.460
I could get on a plane tomorrow,
and no one could stop me.

19:47.460 --> 19:49.130
That's not what I want.

19:49.130 --> 19:50.340
No, you want to be helpful.

19:50.340 --> 19:52.250
'Cause you're a good person.

19:52.250 --> 19:54.550
You shouldn't be insulting me.

19:54.550 --> 19:56.000
What should I be doing?

19:56.000 --> 19:56.880
Thanking me.

19:56.880 --> 19:58.750
You're better now
because of me.

19:58.750 --> 20:02.290
I'm better because I took
the time to get better.

20:02.290 --> 20:03.630
I gave you that time.

20:03.630 --> 20:05.290
You gave me nothing.

20:05.290 --> 20:07.590
You are nothing.

20:10.090 --> 20:13.290
The person who killed
Rachel Garner...

20:13.290 --> 20:15.290
was angry.

20:15.290 --> 20:18.750
I could tell
from the photos you showed me.

20:18.750 --> 20:20.290
He hated her.

20:20.290 --> 20:22.170
Why did he hate her?

20:22.170 --> 20:23.960
You're the detective, Sherlock.

20:23.960 --> 20:26.710
You go and figure that out.

20:33.710 --> 20:35.960
Did you not get my texts?

20:35.960 --> 20:37.960
No, my phone's been off.
I've been working.

20:37.960 --> 20:39.960
Marcus and I think
we've got something.

20:39.960 --> 20:42.500
We went to go talk to
William Bazemore's neighbor.

20:42.500 --> 20:44.340
He confirmed
that Michael was friends

20:44.340 --> 20:46.460
with William
and his husband, Ray,

20:46.460 --> 20:47.750
until Ray killed himself.

20:47.750 --> 20:49.290
They were all in
the program together.

20:49.290 --> 20:51.170
And a suicide
is helpful to us why?

20:51.170 --> 20:53.550
Well, that's just it.
I don't think it was a suicide.

20:53.550 --> 20:55.420
Ray did not leave
a handwritten note.

20:55.420 --> 20:56.590
He sent an e-mail saying

20:56.590 --> 20:58.170
that he didn't think
he could stay sober,

20:58.170 --> 21:01.090
and that he did not want
to drag William down with him.

21:01.090 --> 21:02.750
You think Michael wrote it?

21:02.750 --> 21:04.500
Strangled Ray,
faked the hanging?

21:04.500 --> 21:05.960
Well, the neighbor
confirmed that Ray

21:05.960 --> 21:08.300
fell off the wagon
a few months before he died.

21:08.300 --> 21:10.800
And William
was Michael's friend.

21:10.800 --> 21:12.590
And we know that Michael
has a funny way

21:12.590 --> 21:14.750
of helping his friends
stay sober.

21:14.750 --> 21:15.670
Well, that's intriguing,

21:15.670 --> 21:17.290
but I have something
which requires

21:17.290 --> 21:19.290
more immediate attention.

21:20.130 --> 21:22.960
"YourSobriety.com"?
Yes, they sell...

21:22.960 --> 21:26.380
fancy sobriety coins, like
the ones you get at meetings.

21:26.380 --> 21:29.130
Michael bought one recently.

21:29.130 --> 21:30.050
How do you know?

21:30.050 --> 21:31.170
Because I went to see him.

21:31.170 --> 21:33.050
The FBI followed him
to his office.

21:33.050 --> 21:34.170
I slipped past their dragnet

21:34.170 --> 21:36.460
and waited by his car
so we could talk.

21:36.460 --> 21:39.170
Alone in a dark
parking garage.

21:39.170 --> 21:40.290
I live to tell the tale.

21:40.290 --> 21:41.340
And this made it worthwhile.

21:41.340 --> 21:43.630
He had his five-year
anniversary while he was

21:43.630 --> 21:46.210
in hiding, and he bought
one of these coins

21:46.210 --> 21:47.290
to mark the occasion.

21:47.290 --> 21:50.290
He also bought
this platinum-plated key chain

21:50.290 --> 21:51.550
to hold it.

21:51.550 --> 21:54.300
YourSobriety.com is the only
place that sells them.

21:54.300 --> 21:58.250
You said this requires
more immediate attention?

21:58.250 --> 22:00.250
We know that Michael kept
trophies of his victims,

22:00.250 --> 22:02.460
but they were all gone
when you searched his apartment.

22:02.460 --> 22:04.420
I thought it would be
worthwhile to find out

22:04.420 --> 22:06.300
where he's been staying
the last few months.

22:06.300 --> 22:08.170
I don't think
a company that sells

22:08.170 --> 22:09.290
to anonymous people
in recovery

22:09.290 --> 22:11.290
is gonna tell you where
they shipped those medallions.

22:11.290 --> 22:13.290
I didn't ask them.
I asked Everyone.

22:13.290 --> 22:15.750
They hate people like Michael
as much as they like

22:15.750 --> 22:17.250
living in their mothers'
basements.

22:17.250 --> 22:18.590
They collected the
appropriate data,

22:18.590 --> 22:22.130
and they sent me
the most promising addresses.

22:22.840 --> 22:24.710
Now, the company
has sold hundreds

22:24.710 --> 22:27.380
of these key chains over
the last few months.

22:27.380 --> 22:29.590
Everyone identified
two dozen addresses

22:29.590 --> 22:31.290
where it was
difficult to verify

22:31.290 --> 22:32.840
the identity
of the recipient.

22:32.840 --> 22:36.000
As you can see,
I narrowed it down to one.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.170
Richard Mosely.

22:37.170 --> 22:39.380
Albany, New York. So you
think, this whole time,

22:39.380 --> 22:40.800
he was just
a few hours away?

22:40.800 --> 22:43.290
I e-mailed a photograph
of Michael to the superintendent

22:43.290 --> 22:45.460
of the building
where Mr. Mosely resides,

22:45.460 --> 22:48.170
and he said they
are one and the same.

22:48.170 --> 22:49.130
So now what?

22:49.130 --> 22:51.710
I called in an anonymous tip
to the NYPD

22:51.710 --> 22:52.800
just before you arrived.

22:52.800 --> 22:55.630
I said I saw Rachel Garner
in distress

22:55.630 --> 22:58.340
outside Mr. Mosely's building on
the same night she disappeared.

22:58.340 --> 23:00.380
I estimate we'll have
a warrant to search

23:00.380 --> 23:04.130
Michael's little hideaway
within the hour.

23:05.710 --> 23:07.170
JUDGE:
An anonymous tip?

23:07.170 --> 23:10.250
Guy said he saw Rachel
Garner getting dragged

23:10.250 --> 23:11.960
out of that
apartment by a man

23:11.960 --> 23:14.170
who fits our suspect's
description.

23:14.170 --> 23:17.250
And the witness
wouldn't identify himself.

23:17.250 --> 23:18.670
That's pretty convenient.

23:18.670 --> 23:20.920
Maybe he was afraid
of pissing off

23:20.920 --> 23:22.290
a serial killer, Your Honor.

23:22.290 --> 23:25.290
And maybe he's one
of your people.

23:25.290 --> 23:27.290
You turned me down once before

23:27.290 --> 23:29.840
when we had this guy
in our sights.

23:29.840 --> 23:33.170
Now he's back,
and we got another body.

23:33.170 --> 23:34.920
I follow the letter
of the law.

23:34.920 --> 23:37.300
You don't throw
civil liberties out on a hunch.

23:37.300 --> 23:41.550
I'm not keen to do it
on an anonymous tip, either.

23:41.550 --> 23:43.250
Then consider the pattern.

23:43.250 --> 23:45.840
He leaves town,
the killing stops.

23:45.840 --> 23:46.710
He comes back,

23:46.710 --> 23:49.960
and the same day, we have
our first body in months.

23:49.960 --> 23:54.590
Now we know he's been staying
in Albany under a fake name.

23:54.590 --> 23:56.170
Come on, Marilyn.

23:56.170 --> 24:00.500
I thought you'd want to do
the right thing this time.

24:01.090 --> 24:04.290
The request for electronic
surveillance is denied.

24:04.290 --> 24:05.550
But I'm granting
you the right

24:05.550 --> 24:07.630
to search the
Albany residence.

24:10.300 --> 24:12.500
Good luck, Tom.

24:17.840 --> 24:21.210
♪ ♪

24:26.750 --> 24:28.050
I'll take the back.

24:28.050 --> 24:30.290
OFFICER:
Check that bathroom.

24:32.630 --> 24:33.300
All clear.

24:33.300 --> 24:36.210
Bathroom clear.
All clear!

24:42.590 --> 24:46.050
Looks like the decision to leave
was an impulsive one.

24:46.050 --> 24:47.880
BELL:
Sherlock, Joan.

24:47.880 --> 24:50.000
Get back here.

24:55.880 --> 24:59.710
I think he was shopping
for new victims.

25:08.920 --> 25:11.920
Yeah, we'll be here.

25:11.920 --> 25:13.250
All right.

25:13.250 --> 25:14.630
FBI's sending more people.

25:14.630 --> 25:15.840
I told 'em we got 30 women

25:15.840 --> 25:18.290
that need to be I.D.'d
and accounted for.

25:18.290 --> 25:19.340
26, actually.

25:19.340 --> 25:21.290
Looks like he followed
these four more than once.

25:21.290 --> 25:23.880
They're wearing different
outfits on different days.

25:23.880 --> 25:26.000
These are the ones
he seems most interested in.

25:26.510 --> 25:28.590
Look.

25:29.350 --> 25:30.390
This is one of the women

25:30.390 --> 25:32.260
he followed on more
than one occasion.

25:32.260 --> 25:33.590
Look at the wing mirror.

25:33.590 --> 25:35.970
BELL:
It's his reflection. So what?

25:35.970 --> 25:38.470
So that photograph was taken
at 11:00 p.m. Tuesday.

25:38.470 --> 25:40.470
This past Tuesday?
How can you tell?

25:40.470 --> 25:42.550
'Cause the bank sign
in the background

25:42.550 --> 25:44.590
has the date, time
and temperature.

25:44.590 --> 25:46.720
So Michael wasn't lying.

25:46.720 --> 25:48.590
When Rachel Garner
was being strangled

25:48.590 --> 25:52.590
and left at Saint Olaf's,
he was a hundred miles away.

25:52.590 --> 25:54.640
He really didn't do it.

25:57.440 --> 25:59.900
How sure are we this photo
wasn't tampered with?

26:00.090 --> 26:03.170
Positive. That bank you
see in the background--

26:03.170 --> 26:05.050
the camera over its ATM

26:05.050 --> 26:07.990
caught Michael Rowan driving
away just after midnight.

26:08.790 --> 26:09.880
So, what are we thinking?

26:09.880 --> 26:13.000
He farmed the Garner murder out
to someone to confuse us?

26:13.000 --> 26:15.670
Crossed our minds,
him working with an accomplice,

26:15.670 --> 26:16.790
but it doesn't fit with his M.O.

26:16.790 --> 26:18.920
HOLMES: Killing is part of
his mental health protocol.

26:18.920 --> 26:20.920
It's like exercise-- can't ask
someone to do it for you.

26:21.020 --> 26:22.850
That just leaves one option.

26:22.850 --> 26:23.730
A copycat.

26:23.730 --> 26:24.940
You do realize
what you're implying.

26:24.940 --> 26:26.850
Some of these details
were never in the press.

26:26.850 --> 26:28.230
The rubber tubing,
the connection to you

26:28.230 --> 26:29.770
and your recovery meetings.
HOLMES: Correct.

26:29.770 --> 26:31.730
Whoever committed this
murder was someone

26:31.730 --> 26:33.230
with privileged knowledge
of the case.

26:33.230 --> 26:34.400
Let's not mince words here.

26:34.400 --> 26:36.150
You're talking about
one of your own.

26:36.150 --> 26:36.940
Or one of yours.

26:36.940 --> 26:38.310
GREGSON:
Whoever it was-- FBI,

26:38.310 --> 26:41.940
NYPD, a victim's loved one
who got too much info--

26:41.940 --> 26:44.310
we've got our work
cut out for us.

26:44.310 --> 26:45.650
We're putting together a list.

26:45.650 --> 26:48.310
Everyone who's touched
this case, who knew the details.

26:48.310 --> 26:49.850
Killer's gotta be
in there somewhere.

26:49.850 --> 26:51.890
You can have the names
of everyone in the Bureau

26:51.890 --> 26:52.980
that's been briefed on the case.

26:52.980 --> 26:54.690
Any help I can spare,
you got it.

26:54.690 --> 26:55.890
But the federal focus
is going to stay

26:55.890 --> 26:57.730
on Michael Rowan.
He's still the prize,

26:57.730 --> 26:58.770
as far as I'm concerned.

26:58.770 --> 27:00.560
Agreed.
With any luck, we'll soon have

27:00.560 --> 27:02.890
a new front
from which to attack him.

27:02.890 --> 27:03.850
What do you mean?

27:03.850 --> 27:05.810
I might not be the only person
whose benefitted

27:05.810 --> 27:07.150
from Michael's
unique brand of help.

27:07.150 --> 27:10.890
My partner's looking into it
as we speak.

27:17.690 --> 27:19.650
I don't understand.

27:19.650 --> 27:20.900
Why would you
make me look

27:20.900 --> 27:22.770
at these pictures
of my husband?

27:22.770 --> 27:26.230
I'm sorry. I know
how painful this must be,

27:26.230 --> 27:29.190
but I need you
to see the truth.

27:29.190 --> 27:31.520
Which is what?

27:32.150 --> 27:37.020
These ligature markings--
if you look carefully,

27:37.020 --> 27:40.230
there are two distinct
patterns of bruising.

27:40.230 --> 27:42.770
There's a thinner line,
and there's a thicker one

27:42.770 --> 27:44.060
that almost covers it up.

27:44.060 --> 27:46.900
I don't understand.

27:46.900 --> 27:48.310
You've seen the news.

27:48.310 --> 27:52.890
The people that we think
Michael killed were strangled.

27:54.020 --> 27:56.650
I don't think I've ever met
someone so cruel.

27:56.650 --> 27:58.310
You found out that
Ray hung himself,

27:58.310 --> 27:59.480
and so you
thought that you

27:59.480 --> 28:01.560
could blame Michael
for that, too?

28:01.560 --> 28:03.690
The chief medical examiner
himself noted

28:03.690 --> 28:05.890
there were odd signs
of dual lividity

28:05.890 --> 28:06.890
in your husband's feet.

28:06.890 --> 28:09.650
Now, he chalked it up
to Ray's shoes being too tight,

28:09.650 --> 28:12.890
but I think it's proof
that Ray was hung

28:12.890 --> 28:14.890
sometime after he was killed.

28:14.890 --> 28:18.060
No. Michael wouldn't
have done that.

28:18.060 --> 28:19.310
He...

28:19.310 --> 28:21.230
There was a note.

28:21.230 --> 28:22.150
Ray left a note.

28:22.150 --> 28:25.440
He said he wasn't
strong enough...

28:25.440 --> 28:26.310
In an e-mail.

28:26.310 --> 28:27.900
Michael could have
forced him to write it,

28:27.900 --> 28:29.810
or he could have
written it himself

28:29.810 --> 28:31.520
after Ray was dead.

28:31.520 --> 28:32.270
Why?

28:32.270 --> 28:33.350
If I'm right,
Michael thought

28:33.350 --> 28:34.850
he was a threat
to your sobriety,

28:34.850 --> 28:36.770
so he decided
it would be better for you

28:36.770 --> 28:38.890
to be alone
than to be a heroin addict.

28:38.890 --> 28:41.940
Obviously, I did not know Ray.
You did.

28:41.940 --> 28:46.310
So, did Ray killing himself
make any sense to you?

28:47.520 --> 28:48.900
No.

28:48.900 --> 28:51.890
But Michael, he, um...

28:51.890 --> 28:54.890
he said that he had seen signs.

28:54.890 --> 28:57.480
We didn't think that you lied
when you said you

28:57.480 --> 28:59.310
believed Michael,
but please, if you can think

28:59.310 --> 29:03.020
of anything
that might help us...

29:03.850 --> 29:05.560
I need to be alone now.

29:05.560 --> 29:06.890
Mr. Bazemore...

29:06.890 --> 29:08.890
I'm not saying I won't help.

29:08.890 --> 29:09.890
I just...

29:09.890 --> 29:13.690
I need time to wrap
my head around this.

29:34.890 --> 29:36.560
Not a fan of file folders?

29:36.560 --> 29:38.150
Why put the truth in a drawer?

29:38.150 --> 29:41.270
This way, I can feel mocked
by the sea of innocent people

29:41.270 --> 29:42.980
that I thought capable
of murder.

29:42.980 --> 29:43.940
It's humbling.

29:43.940 --> 29:46.810
So you don't think anyone
in law enforcement

29:46.810 --> 29:47.890
killed Rachel Garner.

29:47.890 --> 29:50.020
Well, I wouldn't say that
definitively,

29:50.020 --> 29:51.060
but everyone on our list

29:51.060 --> 29:53.890
has been provisionally removed
from suspicion.

29:53.890 --> 29:55.400
They lack obvious motive.

29:55.400 --> 29:57.890
Nothing on social media?
No overlaps between

29:57.890 --> 29:59.890
the victim and any
of these people?

29:59.890 --> 30:00.890
I've looked at every detective

30:00.890 --> 30:02.440
on every case
where Michael is a suspect.

30:02.440 --> 30:04.440
All of the FBI agents
who joined the investigation.

30:04.440 --> 30:07.600
All the CSU officers
who worked the murder scenes.

30:07.600 --> 30:08.650
The victims' families.

30:08.650 --> 30:11.650
Everyone on our list--
all a colossal waste of time.

30:11.650 --> 30:13.230
Maybe we're doing this
backwards.

30:13.230 --> 30:15.900
We thought that there
was gonna be an obvious link

30:15.900 --> 30:18.100
between one of these people
and Rachel.

30:18.100 --> 30:20.890
You want to focus on the victim,
emanate outwards?

30:20.890 --> 30:22.850
I was gonna pay a visit
to her office,

30:22.850 --> 30:24.940
look around,
talk to her friends there.

30:24.940 --> 30:27.650
You want to come with?

30:31.480 --> 30:32.350
There.

30:32.350 --> 30:34.060
That'll let you
into Rachel's personal files,

30:34.060 --> 30:37.060
but, uh, you know, I-I can't
let you into the firm's system

30:37.060 --> 30:39.890
without authorization
from someone pretty high up.

30:39.890 --> 30:41.650
Well, he's a police captain,

30:41.650 --> 30:43.890
but I'm not in the mood
to argue.

30:43.890 --> 30:45.440
The day Rachel was
killed, Tuesday,

30:45.440 --> 30:47.890
did you notice anything
unusual going on with her?

30:47.890 --> 30:50.150
No. Typical Raych.
She stayed till about 7:00.

30:50.150 --> 30:52.310
She was a hard worker.
She was a good one.

30:52.310 --> 30:56.100
Do you know who she was close to
here at the office?

30:56.100 --> 30:57.980
We're gonna want
to talk to them.

30:57.980 --> 31:00.890
EMPLOYEE: Yeah. I can
show you around.

31:01.600 --> 31:02.900
Captain.

31:02.900 --> 31:04.480
EMPLOYEE:
Dude.

31:04.480 --> 31:05.690
If you want to look in the desk,

31:05.690 --> 31:07.770
I would've gotten you
a spare key from HR.

31:07.770 --> 31:09.020
I didn't break the lock.

31:09.020 --> 31:10.310
It's been tampered with.

31:10.310 --> 31:11.770
Someone didn't
want us to find

31:11.770 --> 31:13.850
what she was keeping
in this drawer.

31:13.850 --> 31:14.890
So, safe to assume
the culprit

31:14.890 --> 31:16.810
couldn't just walk in
off the street, right?

31:16.810 --> 31:18.350
No, we got security
all over the building.

31:18.350 --> 31:20.650
Someone who works here
must have done that.

31:20.650 --> 31:21.890
Are you authorized to at least

31:21.890 --> 31:23.600
provide us
with a company directory?

31:23.600 --> 31:25.600
GREGSON:
We're not gonna need one.

31:25.600 --> 31:26.810
Daniel Cummings.

31:26.810 --> 31:28.890
Did he work with
Rachel directly?

31:28.890 --> 31:31.060
EMPLOYEE:
Yeah, probably.

31:31.060 --> 31:32.440
Dan's a partner, so...

31:32.440 --> 31:33.890
everyone works with him
eventually.

31:33.890 --> 31:35.690
There's at least one name
I should have added

31:35.690 --> 31:37.890
to the list this morning.
I just never thought...

31:37.890 --> 31:38.890
Who's Daniel Cummings?

31:38.890 --> 31:41.890
The judge that turned us down
for the warrant--

31:41.890 --> 31:43.850
he's her husband.

31:43.850 --> 31:45.730
(knock at door)

31:46.810 --> 31:50.770
Make it snappy, Tom.
I have got a dinner at 8:00.

31:51.900 --> 31:53.440
And you are?

31:53.440 --> 31:54.890
Nauseated by you.

31:54.890 --> 31:55.890
But call me Sherlock.

31:55.890 --> 31:58.770
If you're looking for me
to sign off on another warrant,

31:58.770 --> 32:00.310
I'm not liking your chances.

32:00.310 --> 32:02.020
I'm not here
for a warrant, Marilyn.

32:02.020 --> 32:03.230
I'm here because I know

32:03.230 --> 32:06.020
you're the one
who killed Rachel Garner.

32:06.020 --> 32:06.850
(scoffs) What?

32:06.850 --> 32:08.600
Last night, we learned
that Michael Rowan

32:08.600 --> 32:10.270
has an alibi
for her murder.

32:10.270 --> 32:11.310
He's not responsible.

32:11.310 --> 32:13.650
But his M.O.
was replicated to a T.

32:13.650 --> 32:14.650
That means the killer

32:14.650 --> 32:16.890
had specific knowledge
of his crimes.

32:16.890 --> 32:19.310
You had all the details
laid out for you

32:19.310 --> 32:20.890
in our first
warrant application.

32:20.890 --> 32:23.730
That's how you knew
to leave the body in a place

32:23.730 --> 32:26.150
where you knew
we'd connect the dots to him.

32:26.150 --> 32:26.890
Why the hell would I...?

32:26.890 --> 32:29.730
'Cause Rachel was sleeping
with your husband.

32:29.730 --> 32:31.520
Don't bother denying it.

32:31.520 --> 32:32.560
He didn't.

32:32.560 --> 32:33.890
You've spoken with Dan?

32:33.890 --> 32:35.890
We met with him at your house.

32:35.890 --> 32:38.190
He admitted to breaking
into Rachel's desk

32:38.190 --> 32:40.350
to remove some pictures
that she had

32:40.350 --> 32:41.690
of the two of them together.

32:41.690 --> 32:43.100
He then took us on a tour.

32:43.100 --> 32:44.310
Even showed us your pool.

32:44.310 --> 32:46.190
He told us you're allergic
to chlorine,

32:46.190 --> 32:48.190
which is why you use Baquacil

32:48.190 --> 32:49.020
to keep your pool clean.

32:49.020 --> 32:51.150
That chemical was in Rachel
Garner's hair when we found her.

32:51.150 --> 32:54.890
Dan told us Rachel usually
came over on Tuesday nights.

32:54.890 --> 32:57.890
That's when you have
your Bar Association meetings.

32:57.890 --> 33:00.100
Rachel had her own key.
She'd let herself in.

33:00.100 --> 33:03.350
She'd sometimes go swimming
before Dan came home.

33:03.350 --> 33:06.940
You found out about all of it,
so you killed her.

33:06.940 --> 33:08.980
HOLMES:
When Michael Rowan
saw a picture

33:08.980 --> 33:10.310
of Rachel's body, he said

33:10.310 --> 33:12.520
that whoever killed her
hated her.

33:12.520 --> 33:14.480
I don't know what
it was that he saw,

33:14.480 --> 33:16.440
but it turns out he was right.

33:16.440 --> 33:17.890
I don't know, Tom.

33:17.890 --> 33:20.890
It sounds like a weak,
circumstantial case.

33:20.890 --> 33:22.600
An affair.

33:22.600 --> 33:23.890
Baquacil.

33:23.890 --> 33:27.440
You think that's enough
to come after a judge?

33:27.440 --> 33:28.020
Not yet.

33:28.020 --> 33:30.520
But you've had
a long career on the bench.

33:30.520 --> 33:32.890
You know what it's like
for the loved ones

33:32.890 --> 33:34.230
of Michael Rowan's victims.

33:34.230 --> 33:37.440
You know the pain
that they're in right now.

33:37.440 --> 33:40.600
And you also know
that the murder you committed

33:40.600 --> 33:42.650
is gonna muddy the waters
for anyone

33:42.650 --> 33:46.150
trying to build a case
against that son of a bitch.

33:46.150 --> 33:48.690
Marilyn,
I'm begging you,

33:48.690 --> 33:51.690
don't do that to these families.

33:56.890 --> 33:58.730
WATSON:
So, she's taking a plea?

33:58.730 --> 34:00.900
HOLMES (over phone):
The D.A. himself graced us

34:00.900 --> 34:02.940
with his presence
to sign the deal.

34:02.940 --> 34:06.890
That's one less strangler
to deal with.

34:06.890 --> 34:08.020
One to go.

34:08.020 --> 34:09.600
I'll be home soon.

34:09.600 --> 34:11.889
Okay. I'll see you then.

34:24.230 --> 34:26.310
I told you
I didn't kill her.

34:26.310 --> 34:28.900
(gasps, groans)

34:29.060 --> 34:32.020
Been wanting to meet you
for a long time, Joan.

34:32.020 --> 34:35.889
William Bazemore
called me this afternoon.

34:35.889 --> 34:38.520
He, uh, said you
paid him a visit.

34:38.520 --> 34:40.900
Said you thought
I'd killed Ray.

34:40.900 --> 34:42.150
Which I did.

34:42.150 --> 34:43.980
(gasps, groans)

34:43.980 --> 34:46.940
William hung up on me,
then a couple hours later,

34:46.940 --> 34:50.480
I got a call from a friend
in the program.

34:50.480 --> 34:52.889
Said William had O.D.'d.

34:52.889 --> 34:53.889
12 years sober.

34:53.889 --> 34:56.350
That's what you took away
from him.

34:56.350 --> 34:58.890
(yelps in pain)

34:58.890 --> 35:01.270
(coughs)

35:04.730 --> 35:06.730
MICHAEL:
Wow.

All this for me.

35:10.190 --> 35:13.100
I'm almost flattered.

Yeah.

38:36.700 --> 38:38.620
Michael got it worse.

38:38.990 --> 38:40.410
Can I ask how the FBI managed

38:40.410 --> 38:42.700
to lose track of him?
He went to a restaurant

38:42.700 --> 38:44.450
in Times Square,
got lost in the crowd.

38:44.450 --> 38:46.120

He was bleeding profusely

traces headed north

38:52.540 --> 38:54.250
towards
Greenpoint Avenue Station.

38:54.250 --> 38:55.500
Has anyone been there?

38:55.500 --> 38:56.990
We still don't know
his whereabouts.

38:56.990 --> 38:58.950
The Feds
are finally back up

38:58.950 --> 38:59.950
on his phones.

38:59.950 --> 39:01.990
Well, the good thing
about him trying to kill me

39:01.990 --> 39:04.990
is that we can get
all the warrants we want,

39:04.990 --> 39:07.370
and there's plenty
to charge him with.

39:07.370 --> 39:09.330
CSU is done

39:09.330 --> 39:10.120
with your place.

39:10.120 --> 39:11.990
Um, I've got
two officers downstairs.

39:11.990 --> 39:12.950
Bailey and Walker.

39:12.950 --> 39:13.990
Whenever you're ready to go,

39:13.990 --> 39:16.160
they'll drive you home.
HOLMES: Actually,

39:16.160 --> 39:17.790
we discussed it--
she's gonna go and stay

39:17.790 --> 39:20.330
with her parents in Westchester
for a few nights.

39:20.330 --> 39:21.620
Okay.

39:21.620 --> 39:24.330
I'll go tell my guys.

39:26.990 --> 39:28.790
Watson...

39:28.790 --> 39:30.700
Sherlock.

39:31.700 --> 39:32.660
If you say sorry,

39:32.660 --> 39:35.450
I'm gonna break one
of your ribs.

39:39.370 --> 39:41.910
Just find him.

39:45.910 --> 39:49.700
Yeah. Pull 'em out of there
and call me back.

39:49.700 --> 39:50.750
Another false alarm?

39:50.750 --> 39:53.990
Yeah, some rookie from
Midtown South saw a guy

39:53.990 --> 39:57.660
that looked like Rowan
outside Penn Station.

39:57.660 --> 39:59.910
Obviously wasn't him.

40:01.700 --> 40:02.910
You looking at Queens again?

40:02.910 --> 40:05.580
Yeah, I've been looking
at how we're using our people.

40:05.580 --> 40:09.250
I think stepped-up patrols near
his home and office are fine,

40:09.250 --> 40:12.830
but these guys out in Flushing
and Douglaston--

40:12.830 --> 40:13.990
maybe we get them on phones,

40:13.990 --> 40:16.910
making calls to towns
on major bus lines,

40:16.910 --> 40:18.990
cities with
international airports.

40:18.990 --> 40:20.990
You think he got out
of the city?

40:20.990 --> 40:22.250
It's been almost a day.

40:22.250 --> 40:23.870
And he's done it before.

40:23.870 --> 40:26.410
(cell phone rings)

40:27.580 --> 40:28.990
Gregson.

40:28.990 --> 40:31.990
MALLICK:
You can call off the dogs, Tom.

40:31.990 --> 40:34.700
We found Michael Rowan.

40:35.370 --> 40:37.290
Where?

40:44.990 --> 40:46.790
(cell phone rings)

40:46.790 --> 40:48.990
(sighs)

40:50.990 --> 40:51.990
Captain?

40:51.990 --> 40:52.990
GREGSON:
Rowan's dead.

40:52.990 --> 40:56.540
Somebody beat him to death
and put him in the garbage.

40:56.540 --> 40:57.540
What? Where?

40:57.540 --> 40:58.330
Well, we don't know exactly.

40:58.330 --> 41:00.700
His body just turned up
at a transfer station

41:00.700 --> 41:04.580
that the Sanitation Department
uses out here in Hunts Point.

41:04.580 --> 41:06.660
The Feds are in command
of the scene,

41:06.660 --> 41:09.200
and they're determined
to treat this like any other

41:09.200 --> 41:12.250
homicide case.
I'll come out immediately.

41:12.250 --> 41:12.990
No.

41:12.990 --> 41:15.120
That's what I'm
trying to tell you.

41:15.120 --> 41:16.200
You can't.

41:16.200 --> 41:18.990
I've just been informed
that Joan is gonna

41:18.990 --> 41:22.870
have to surrender herself
to the FBI.

41:22.870 --> 41:25.990
She's their prime suspect.
