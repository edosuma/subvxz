WEBVTT

00:12.160 --> 00:14.940
( Screaming )

00:15.040 --> 00:16.740
Confusion, chaos.

00:16.840 --> 00:18.820
That was the scene
in the city earlier today

00:18.920 --> 00:21.460
as the park blasted off
into the sky.

00:21.560 --> 00:23.340
Who is responsible?

00:23.440 --> 00:25.340
( Indistinct shouting )

00:25.440 --> 00:27.540
I'm rich.
No comment!

00:27.640 --> 00:30.300
And it kind of sounded
like a kafwaw!

00:30.400 --> 00:32.180
No, wait, I guess it was
more like a ââ

00:32.280 --> 00:36.100
Boom! And parks from different
countries around the world...

00:36.200 --> 00:38.980
Have mysterious launched into
space, taking along with them...

00:39.080 --> 00:42.100
âAnimals and...
âMy car! Hey!

00:42.200 --> 00:44.660
Well, all this reporter
can do is hope

00:44.760 --> 00:47.900
that everyone
is holding it together up there.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.780
( Screaming )

00:50.880 --> 00:52.460
âWhat's going on?
âWhat is that?

00:52.560 --> 00:54.060
( Indistinct shouting )

00:54.160 --> 00:56.220
Why am I still
wearing this thing?

00:56.320 --> 00:58.100
Hyah!
( Panting )

00:58.200 --> 00:59.660
There's no cell service!

00:59.760 --> 01:01.620
I need
to call my wife!

01:01.720 --> 01:04.120
How am I gonna call
my wife?!

01:05.040 --> 01:07.620
Be careful what you write
in your dream journal, Eileen.

01:07.720 --> 01:09.420
You might just get it.

01:09.520 --> 01:11.300
Oh, no!
I'm lost forever!

01:11.400 --> 01:13.300
We're gonna starve to death
and die out here!

01:13.400 --> 01:15.400
We got to press
the button again!

01:14.880 --> 01:16.580
( Groaning )
No, we got to calm ââ

01:16.680 --> 01:18.180
( Groans )

01:18.280 --> 01:20.540
Go back,
go back, go back, go back.

01:20.640 --> 01:22.020
( Cries )

01:22.120 --> 01:24.300
I'm a high school graduate.

01:24.400 --> 01:27.500
I'm too young to die
in space.

01:27.600 --> 01:28.740
( Panting )

01:28.840 --> 01:30.700
( Indistinct panicking )

01:30.800 --> 01:32.500
Stop!

01:32.600 --> 01:34.620
Everybody calm down.

01:34.720 --> 01:36.620
We've done this before, guys.

01:36.720 --> 01:39.220
Last time we got trapped in
the dome, we panicked, right?

01:39.320 --> 01:41.580
But then we banded together
and figured it out.

01:41.680 --> 01:43.220
We can't fall apart now.

01:43.320 --> 01:46.020
We are going to figure out how
to get home,

01:46.120 --> 01:47.980
but we have to survive first.

01:48.080 --> 01:50.120
All we have to do is make it
through one day at a time.

01:50.200 --> 01:51.620
Mordecai is right.

01:51.720 --> 01:53.720
We'll handle this like
we handle everything else ââ

01:53.800 --> 01:55.840
with a morning meeting.

02:01.120 --> 02:04.220
All right, the most important
thing is that we call Maellard

02:04.320 --> 02:06.300
so we can get off this thing
and back to Earth.

02:06.400 --> 02:08.860
In the meantime, I'm gonna be
setting some survival tasks.

02:08.960 --> 02:10.140
First up is Skips.

02:10.240 --> 02:11.940
I'm gonna need you
to go around the park

02:12.040 --> 02:14.040
and look for a cellphone signal.

02:13.280 --> 02:15.280
We have no other way
to contact Earth,

02:14.800 --> 02:17.540
so this is priority number one.
âHmm.

02:17.640 --> 02:18.860
Benson:
Mordecai and Rigby,

02:18.960 --> 02:20.960
you go explore the tunnels
under the park.

02:20.680 --> 02:22.780
Rigby: Aw, man.
It's creepy down there.

02:22.880 --> 02:25.380
I don't want to hear it.

02:25.480 --> 02:27.180
Pops and Eileen, I need you

02:27.280 --> 02:29.300
to take inventory
of the food supplies.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.400
We have no idea
how long we'll out here,

02:31.080 --> 02:33.080
so we better make
the most of it.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.700
Muscle Man and Hi Fives.
âWhooâhoo!

02:36.800 --> 02:38.920
Benson: You're in charge
of finding building supplies,

02:39.000 --> 02:41.660
first aid, and anything else
we might be able to use.

02:41.760 --> 02:44.440
( Grunting )

02:46.400 --> 02:48.780
Well, it looks like Mordecai
and Rigby aren't back yet,

02:48.880 --> 02:51.100
so Pops and Eileen,
how about an update?

02:51.200 --> 02:54.500
Well, we found an unusual amount
of small foods ââ

02:54.600 --> 02:57.260
baby carrots, baby corn,
and some fingerlings,

02:57.360 --> 02:59.180
which are basically
baby potatoes.

02:59.280 --> 03:02.500
The garden was recently ravaged
by a weevil blight,

03:02.600 --> 03:04.420
so at this point,
we're just left

03:04.520 --> 03:06.700
with a large variety
of onions.

03:06.800 --> 03:09.860
So, we only have dirt
vegetables and baby food?

03:09.960 --> 03:11.500
Well,
what did you guys find?

03:11.600 --> 03:14.280
Feast your eyes on this.

03:16.280 --> 03:20.180
A talk and text, some rebar,
a Bundt cake pan?

03:20.280 --> 03:21.980
How'd it go for you,
Skips?

03:22.080 --> 03:23.820
I couldn't get a signal.

03:23.920 --> 03:25.540
And all this
after they upsold me

03:25.640 --> 03:28.340
on the extended
coverage, too.
Typical.

03:28.440 --> 03:31.300
Hey, maybe I could use this to
help boost the cellphone signal.

03:31.400 --> 03:33.340
Yes!
Yes, this!

03:33.440 --> 03:36.020
This is a plan.
Eileen gets it.

03:36.120 --> 03:38.040
Thanks?
You start building
whatever you need.

03:38.120 --> 03:39.420
Everybody help Eileen.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.560
Now, where are Mordecai
and Rigby?

03:43.000 --> 03:44.780
( Both gasp )
Together: Whoa!

03:44.880 --> 03:46.660
Space carts!

03:46.760 --> 03:49.020
( Both panting )

03:49.120 --> 03:51.700
( Gasps, chuckles )

03:51.800 --> 03:53.500
Whoa!

03:53.600 --> 03:56.260
Whoa.

03:56.360 --> 03:57.420
Whoa!

03:57.520 --> 03:59.180
These things
are hard to control.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.660
( Chuckles )

04:01.760 --> 04:04.160
( Glass cracks )

04:06.960 --> 04:08.340
( Chuckles )

04:08.440 --> 04:10.100
( Crash! )

04:10.200 --> 04:11.620
( Beeping )
Whoa.

04:11.720 --> 04:13.940
( Both groan )

04:14.040 --> 04:16.560
( Both chuckle )

04:18.760 --> 04:20.700
Dude, we're in space.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.420
( Chuckles )
Yeah.

04:22.520 --> 04:24.680
What if we're
stuck here forever?
Might not be so bad.

04:24.760 --> 04:26.300
I mean, we basically
have the park

04:26.400 --> 04:27.940
and all the stuff
we normally have.

04:28.040 --> 04:30.280
Also, I've got Eileen,
and you have...

04:31.240 --> 04:32.900
...me!

04:33.000 --> 04:34.220
And we have spaceships.

04:34.320 --> 04:36.620
Maybe this is how
we become space pilots.

04:36.720 --> 04:38.720
Unless that timeline
is destroyed. I don't know.

04:38.240 --> 04:40.300
Yeah, but we'll probably
make it back to Earth.

04:40.400 --> 04:41.460
( Both laugh )

04:41.560 --> 04:43.180
What are you two doing?

04:43.280 --> 04:46.100
No one's heard from you
for two hours!
Sorry, Benson.

04:46.200 --> 04:48.240
We were exploring and then we
found these space carts.

04:48.320 --> 04:50.320
Yeah, and they were already
crashed and stuff.

04:50.120 --> 04:52.500
I don't care.
I don't care!

04:52.600 --> 04:54.980
I don't care!!
We have a plan now.

04:55.080 --> 04:58.540
Quit goofing off
and get to the surface!

04:58.640 --> 05:00.700
Benson: Well, while you two
were goofing off,

05:00.800 --> 05:02.460
we were getting
stuff done topside.

05:02.560 --> 05:04.540
Eileen?
âAlmost ready to go.

05:04.640 --> 05:07.380
This primitive signal amp
should get us a few bars.

05:07.480 --> 05:09.060
We have another problem,
though.

05:09.160 --> 05:11.340
Over the past few hours,
I've noticed that the Earth

05:11.440 --> 05:13.180
is getting farther
and farther away.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.540
Well, it looks like
it's time to call home.

05:15.640 --> 05:17.380
Skips, flip that switch.

05:17.480 --> 05:20.000
( Gears grinding )

05:27.000 --> 05:28.900
( Beeping )
It's working!

05:29.000 --> 05:30.500
It's working!

05:30.600 --> 05:32.700
It's working!

05:32.800 --> 05:35.180
( Warbling )
( Glass shatters )

05:35.280 --> 05:39.740
( Electricity crackling )

05:39.840 --> 05:41.260
( Beeps )

05:41.360 --> 05:44.540
( Screams )
We're gonna die!

05:44.640 --> 05:48.380
Drifting in space, no way
of communicating with earth ââ

05:48.480 --> 05:51.020
thanks for getting us stuck
in space, Rigby!

05:51.120 --> 05:52.700
You pushed
that button, too.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.340
Your hand was
on top of mine.

05:54.440 --> 05:57.100
âI was just going with the flow!
âGoing with the flow?

05:57.200 --> 05:58.940
I'll show you going
with the flow!

05:59.040 --> 06:00.380
( Grunts )

06:00.480 --> 06:01.540
( Clears throat )

06:01.640 --> 06:03.060
Hyah!

06:03.160 --> 06:05.140
âWhoa, whoa!
âStop, stop!
âCut it out!

06:05.240 --> 06:07.260
( Both grunting )

06:07.360 --> 06:08.860
Stop, stop it!

06:08.960 --> 06:10.700
This is not helpful!

06:10.800 --> 06:12.460
( Grunting )

06:12.560 --> 06:14.540
Huh?

06:14.640 --> 06:15.980
What's that?
âHuh?

06:16.080 --> 06:19.620
I think
it's a satellite.

06:19.720 --> 06:22.220
Looks like
my old car phone.

06:22.320 --> 06:24.020
If we get close enough,
we might be able

06:24.120 --> 06:26.120
to send a signal back
to earth.

06:25.480 --> 06:27.060
Together:
( Gasps ) Space carts!

06:27.160 --> 06:28.340
Oh, no.

06:28.440 --> 06:30.340
This is way too important
to let you drive.

06:30.440 --> 06:31.700
I'm handling this.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.980
( Clicking )
( Groans )

06:34.080 --> 06:36.060
( Car beeps )
Just ââ dang it!

06:36.160 --> 06:37.900
Oh, Benson,
It looks like you're having

06:38.000 --> 06:39.900
some trouble
with the space cart.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.300
Need some help, Benson?

06:41.400 --> 06:43.400
Need some help piloting
the space cart?

06:43.160 --> 06:45.460
I know a couple guys who were
accused of goofing off

06:45.560 --> 06:47.560
when it looks like
really they were honing

06:47.400 --> 06:50.380
their spaceâcartâpiloting
skills.

06:50.480 --> 06:52.020
( Grunts )
Fine.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.180
Together:
HmâHmâHmâHmâHmâHmâHmâHmâHmâHm!

06:54.280 --> 06:56.740
Let's fly away
and save the day.

06:56.840 --> 06:59.120
( Electronic whirring )

07:03.480 --> 07:04.700
We're doomed.

07:09.600 --> 07:12.160
( Radio static )
How's it going up there, guys?

07:13.880 --> 07:16.140
We're getting pretty close,
but no signal, yet.

07:16.240 --> 07:18.140
Shouldn't they have found
something by now?

07:18.240 --> 07:21.160
They'll find something.
They've got to.

07:25.080 --> 07:27.380
( Beep )
( Gasps ) Mordecai, look!

07:27.480 --> 07:28.740
( Beeping )

07:28.840 --> 07:31.660
Together: Huh?
( Beep )

07:31.760 --> 07:33.060
Trust no one?

07:33.160 --> 07:34.900
Look out!

07:35.000 --> 07:37.220
( All scream )

07:37.320 --> 07:38.740
( Grunting )

07:38.840 --> 07:40.220
I can't control it,
dude!

07:40.320 --> 07:44.620
( Both screaming )

07:44.720 --> 07:46.720
How do we get them
back inside?

07:46.000 --> 07:48.540
Somebody's got
to go out to get them.

07:48.640 --> 07:50.800
âWe're on it!
âI'll get the moon door.

07:53.720 --> 07:56.180
( Both screaming )

07:56.280 --> 07:58.340
Together: Help!
All right, all right.

07:58.440 --> 08:01.820
We're gonna get behind you
and, uh, bump you!

08:01.920 --> 08:03.920
We're gonna bump you
right back to the dome.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.140
No bumping!
No bumping!

08:05.240 --> 08:07.240
You saw what happened
to the satellite.

08:06.960 --> 08:08.940
Okay, uh,
start pressing buttons.

08:09.040 --> 08:11.040
This thing's got
to have something

08:10.480 --> 08:12.480
that can help us
get them back.

08:11.600 --> 08:12.620
( Beeping )

08:12.720 --> 08:14.420
( Whirring )

08:14.520 --> 08:16.520
( Chainsaw revs )

08:19.560 --> 08:21.220
( Beep )

08:21.320 --> 08:22.820
( Explosion )

08:22.920 --> 08:24.940
Ahh!
Are you trying to kill us?

08:25.040 --> 08:27.160
( Beeping )

08:28.280 --> 08:30.280
Hi Five: I think you ejected
the oxygen tanks.

08:30.160 --> 08:32.060
Why would there be
a button for that?

08:32.160 --> 08:34.160
You haven't pressed
that one, yet.

08:37.880 --> 08:39.300
Together: Me first!

08:39.400 --> 08:40.660
( Both grunting )

08:40.760 --> 08:42.300
All right.

08:42.400 --> 08:43.500
Go to the left.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.100
I am going to the left.

08:45.200 --> 08:46.780
That's too far.
Stop jiggling it.

08:46.880 --> 08:49.140
âIt's a technique.
âMaybe you need more practice.

08:49.240 --> 08:51.940
Listen, who's driving right now?
I've got this.

08:52.040 --> 08:53.500
( Beep )
( Chain rattles )

08:53.600 --> 08:54.900
This thing is rigged.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.100
Go right.
Right, go!

08:59.920 --> 09:02.180
( Beep )

09:02.280 --> 09:04.780
( Gasps )

09:04.880 --> 09:06.460
âWhooâhoo, you did it!
âYeah, all right!

09:06.560 --> 09:07.660
âYes!
âYes!

09:07.760 --> 09:09.180
( Alarms blaring )
Oh, no, oh, no!

09:09.280 --> 09:11.900
We're running out of air!
â( Inhales deeply )

09:15.320 --> 09:17.460
Benson:
They've got Mordecai and Rigby.

09:17.560 --> 09:19.560
Skips, where are you?

09:21.480 --> 09:23.220
High Five:
The moon door is still closed!

09:23.320 --> 09:24.460
What do we do?!
What do we do?!

09:24.560 --> 09:26.720
You're using up
all the air!

09:28.840 --> 09:30.980
Brace for impact!

09:31.080 --> 09:33.140
( Alarm blaring )

09:33.240 --> 09:35.300
( Both screaming )
( Both gasping )

09:35.400 --> 09:37.700
( Beep )

09:37.800 --> 09:40.080
( Wind gusting )

09:42.240 --> 09:45.340
( All screaming )

09:45.440 --> 09:46.780
( Beep )

09:46.880 --> 09:49.280
( Both screaming )
Pull up, pull up!

09:59.400 --> 10:01.740
âDid you get a signal?
âOnly for a second.

10:01.840 --> 10:03.180
( All groan )

10:03.280 --> 10:05.520
The earth's
so far away now.

10:07.040 --> 10:10.660
We just got to try to take it
one day at a time.

10:10.760 --> 10:13.260
Whoa, look.

10:13.360 --> 10:15.140
The sun is setting.

10:15.240 --> 10:18.060
We did it ââ
we made it through a day!

10:18.160 --> 10:20.220
âYeah, all right!
âYeah!

10:20.320 --> 10:22.140
Uh, guys?

10:22.240 --> 10:24.340
That's not a sunset.

10:47.160 --> 10:49.940
( Both Chuckle )
