The Walking Dead: World Beyond <i>.</i>

00:04.213 --> 00:07.049
<i>I live for my mom, who died</i>
<i>that night ten years ago today.</i>

00:09.135 --> 00:10.386
Mom, please!

00:12.138 --> 00:13.806
I'm so-- I'm sorry.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.767
The CRM is bad
and our dad's in trouble.

00:16.851 --> 00:19.186
He wasn't asking for help,
but we know he might need it

00:19.270 --> 00:20.771
I'm not trying to talk you out of it.

00:21.313 --> 00:23.607
<i>I'm trying to talk you into</i>
<i>letting me go with you.</i>

00:23.691 --> 00:24.525
Me too.

00:25.651 --> 00:26.777
They'll never make it.

00:27.278 --> 00:28.112
They'll die.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.947
<i>Then we have to make sure they don't.</i>

01:31.050 --> 01:34.053
<i>You find yourself face-to-face</i>
<i>with one of the dead.</i>

01:34.637 --> 01:39.058
To eliminate the threat,
you go straight for the brain.

01:42.812 --> 01:46.190
A direct stab through the eye socket
is the easiest way.

01:49.318 --> 01:51.695
Iris? Iris! Let us help!

01:55.282 --> 01:57.660
Right, if you can't get to the brain,
that's okay.

01:59.203 --> 02:01.288
You're going to want to
sweep out its legs.

02:03.582 --> 02:04.416
Iris!

02:05.334 --> 02:08.420
If none of that works,
the last thing that you want to do

02:09.171 --> 02:10.256
is tire yourself out.

02:16.303 --> 02:19.723
In the end though,
it is all about avoidance.

02:20.307 --> 02:23.310
Keeping a safe distance is the
difference between life and death.

02:25.437 --> 02:27.356
Iris, we're not ready.
You're not ready!

02:28.315 --> 02:29.149
I am!

02:34.822 --> 02:35.656
Iris!

02:41.453 --> 02:43.831
<i>Now you'll be scared</i>
<i>the first time you face one.</i>

02:44.540 --> 02:45.374
You should be.

02:48.043 --> 02:49.169
You should be scared

02:49.253 --> 02:52.381
every single time
that you are outside those walls.

03:00.139 --> 03:01.390
Oh, shit...

03:01.473 --> 03:03.017
Hold on, okay? We're coming.

03:12.234 --> 03:13.402
Jesus.

03:14.612 --> 03:15.863
-It's alright.
-Did she- Are you-

03:15.946 --> 03:17.990
It's okay. I'm... I'm okay.

03:18.782 --> 03:19.867
You could have died!

03:19.950 --> 03:20.826
I didn't!

03:25.831 --> 03:26.665
I'm okay.

03:31.003 --> 03:32.963
Its physiology is so different.

03:33.505 --> 03:36.592
It's like you tackled
a bag of ravioli and candy canes.

03:41.347 --> 03:42.348
I got this.

04:02.993 --> 04:03.827
So, uh...

04:04.954 --> 04:06.330
That's what you get!

04:17.466 --> 04:18.300
I'm sorry.

04:46.620 --> 04:49.164
Didn't we use to take piano lessons
on this street?

04:50.499 --> 04:53.168
You did. I quit, remember?

05:20.404 --> 05:23.157
I can't believe the Lieutenant
Colonel gave the girls a map.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.533
A map of New York State.

05:24.616 --> 05:26.493
She said
that's where their father is.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.205
If we told the super the truth,
we'd have ten more hands out here.

05:30.289 --> 05:32.082
If you spill
that old professor-doctor

05:32.166 --> 05:34.251
was sending messages
back here from the CR?

05:34.334 --> 05:36.336
That's a basket of deep-fried shit.

05:36.420 --> 05:37.463
I just don't get it.

05:38.255 --> 05:40.924
It's not like him.
That man does not take risks.

05:41.008 --> 05:43.385
Neither do we. Look at us now.

05:44.595 --> 05:46.305
He loves his girls, you love him.

05:46.889 --> 05:49.308
And I love you, idiot.
Which is why I'm here.

05:50.225 --> 05:52.186
That, and Hope's a good kid.

05:53.937 --> 05:56.607
I may have given her reason
to think she could pull this off.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.650
Well, I love you too Huck,
and no you did not.

05:59.610 --> 06:00.861
Way too early to be nimble.

06:01.612 --> 06:04.239
I've seen you limbo, girl.
I think you'll manage.

06:04.323 --> 06:05.574
Nobody gets lower than me.

06:06.742 --> 06:10.370
But that's when the sun's down,
and the music's up.

06:18.670 --> 06:22.216
I mean, he was risking
the whole Alliance by sending those.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.344
The Civic Republic doesn't play.

06:25.803 --> 06:29.431
You really think he may be in
some kind of trouble? That Will is?

06:32.101 --> 06:34.353
None of his messages
said the CR were bad people.

06:35.354 --> 06:36.438
-Yeah, well...
-Just saying.

06:36.522 --> 06:40.317
Maybe their facility's in trouble.
Maybe their whole community is.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.235
I don't know.

06:42.444 --> 06:43.278
Say what you will...

06:43.362 --> 06:45.656
What, they're
a bunch of black-wearing paranoids,

06:45.739 --> 06:49.409
lightyears ahead of us
in manufacturing, fuel, and chicory?

06:49.493 --> 06:50.702
It's good chicory.

06:50.786 --> 06:53.831
Say what you will about them
not telling anyone where they are.

06:56.083 --> 06:59.503
But also not allowing any sort
of communication in or out.

07:00.045 --> 07:03.715
I mean, that means... That means
that they enforce that from inside,

07:04.716 --> 07:05.717
wherever they are.

07:08.137 --> 07:11.598
Say what you will,
but they handle their shit.

07:13.142 --> 07:14.560
You're sure they're headed east?

07:14.935 --> 07:16.520
This road's the straightest shot.

07:17.980 --> 07:18.939
You know what's east.

07:20.023 --> 07:20.858
It's a funnel.

07:22.151 --> 07:22.985
It'll stop them.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.028
We'll catch them.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.613
The second they catch sight of it,

07:26.697 --> 07:28.991
they'll be glad they still have
a home to go back to.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.453
Hey, Dad. I finally got my check
for all that overtime.

07:33.537 --> 07:34.788
I'll deposit it as soon as--

07:34.872 --> 07:35.956
I used your computer.

07:38.041 --> 07:41.420
Got on that... job website
you wanted me to try.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.714
Found these emails.

07:49.595 --> 07:50.429
Are you a faggot?

07:55.267 --> 07:56.560
You don't say that word to me.

07:58.187 --> 07:59.771
I love you, but don't say that to me.

07:59.855 --> 08:00.772
Because you are?

08:00.856 --> 08:02.316
-This isn't how-
-Are you?

08:08.071 --> 08:08.906
I'm gay, Dad.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.041
Get out of my house.

08:22.961 --> 08:24.129
Dad, things have been hard.

08:24.213 --> 08:26.340
You're not seeing it right,
we can talk about it.

08:26.423 --> 08:27.299
Get out of my house,

08:28.467 --> 08:29.301
right now,

08:30.928 --> 08:31.970
and don't come back.

08:34.973 --> 08:36.099
I don't know you.

08:36.934 --> 08:38.435
Dad, I'm your son.

08:38.518 --> 08:39.937
No, you're not.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.396
-Yeah, I am!
-You're not.

08:41.480 --> 08:44.524
I am your son, goddamn it!
I've been paying your bills,

08:44.608 --> 08:46.068
I've been holding you together,

08:46.151 --> 08:48.612
I've been believing in you
when nobody else would.

08:49.279 --> 08:50.614
I'm going to walk out that door,

08:51.156 --> 08:53.075
and you're going to
have to live with that.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.832
Yeah. I will.

09:15.264 --> 09:16.181
You need that.

09:17.766 --> 09:18.600
No.

09:23.605 --> 09:24.648
We don't need your help.

09:52.134 --> 09:54.970
I didn't know
you could fight empties.

09:57.848 --> 09:58.682
Me either.

10:00.309 --> 10:01.768
What kind of music are you into?

10:03.061 --> 10:04.771
Different... kinds?

10:08.400 --> 10:10.444
Well you should play some
for us sometime.

10:10.527 --> 10:12.070
You know, when it's safe to.

10:14.156 --> 10:15.157
Okay.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.074
Crate!

10:17.868 --> 10:18.702
Strike!

10:19.745 --> 10:20.996
That's the game.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.540
You pick the target,

10:24.583 --> 10:25.959
and then you bowl the ball.

10:27.169 --> 10:28.587
Yeah, name's Big Mo.

10:28.670 --> 10:31.048
Found him sitting all alone,
abandoned on the curb.

10:42.476 --> 10:43.352
Aw, damn.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.228
The wind always wins.

10:47.064 --> 10:47.898
What?

10:48.774 --> 10:50.275
Just something my mom said,

10:50.359 --> 10:52.903
about nature deciding
who lives and who dies.

10:53.862 --> 10:55.072
Turns out she was right.

10:56.782 --> 10:57.616
About what?

10:59.659 --> 11:02.371
Us being at the conclusion
of the Holocene extinction.

11:02.454 --> 11:04.414
The sixth extinction event
on the planet.

11:04.498 --> 11:07.876
We were already killing ourselves
directly and indirectly, but...

11:07.959 --> 11:09.336
nature made a shortcut.

11:11.797 --> 11:15.842
You know, it took the dinosaurs
possibly 60,000 years to die,

11:15.926 --> 11:18.762
after 240 million of living, so...

11:19.888 --> 11:21.431
following that ratio,

11:22.557 --> 11:25.268
given the human race is 600,000

11:25.352 --> 11:28.313
and factoring in
other miscellaneous variables,

11:28.397 --> 11:31.316
I'd say we have about
fifteen years 'til we're gone.

11:33.527 --> 11:34.361
Fifteen years, huh?

11:36.196 --> 11:38.907
I'd have given it way less,
but that's just me.

11:41.952 --> 11:44.079
I'd never have pegged you
for the doomsday type.

11:45.580 --> 11:47.040
You just seem so chill about it.

11:48.917 --> 11:49.793
It's just how it is.

11:51.837 --> 11:53.088
You seem at peace with it.

11:55.298 --> 11:56.133
Most people aren't.

11:58.260 --> 11:59.553
Guess we're not most people.

12:07.060 --> 12:07.894
What is it?

12:10.939 --> 12:12.065
It's The Blaze.

12:18.029 --> 12:18.864
So it's real.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.575
The Blaze of Gory!

12:23.410 --> 12:24.411
Blaze of...

12:25.954 --> 12:26.955
Gory?

12:27.831 --> 12:28.832
The B.O.G.

12:29.416 --> 12:33.753
People have been talking about it
since everything fell apart.

12:33.837 --> 12:37.507
It's this everlasting fire of
totally Old Testament proportions.

12:37.591 --> 12:39.509
The predominant theory
is that it's tires.

12:39.593 --> 12:41.261
A lot of tires.

12:41.344 --> 12:43.180
Left unattended,
they can burn for years,

12:43.263 --> 12:44.347
even decades.

12:45.765 --> 12:48.226
It's... just a fire, though...

12:48.310 --> 12:50.187
No, no, it's much more than that.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.355
The smoke plume
and the firelight after dark

12:52.439 --> 12:55.734
have been attracting empties to it
for years and years,

12:55.817 --> 12:57.277
like moths to a flame.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.237
And the more that come,
the louder it gets,

12:59.321 --> 13:00.280
which attracts more.

13:00.906 --> 13:03.742
Thus explaining why we haven't seen
too many around here.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.495
So can we get through it?

13:12.375 --> 13:13.335
Yeah.

13:13.418 --> 13:14.252
We don't know that.

13:15.378 --> 13:17.130
Why risk it, let's just go around.

13:17.214 --> 13:20.842
We go around, the river cuts us off,
we go sixty miles out of the way.

13:23.845 --> 13:25.805
We should at least
see if it's doable.

13:26.389 --> 13:29.059
You talk me out of stuff like this,
not the other way around.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.144
-That was a long time ago.
-That was yesterday.

13:31.228 --> 13:33.563
Exactly. So let's keep moving.

13:38.610 --> 13:39.444
Okay.

13:40.654 --> 13:41.655
Let's see what we see.

13:43.532 --> 13:44.824
I want to see it regardless.

14:23.029 --> 14:23.863
This was them.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.324
At least one of them.

14:27.158 --> 14:29.160
Whichever one
ate chocolate for breakfast.

14:30.328 --> 14:31.162
That's fun.

14:33.123 --> 14:33.999
I swear to God,

14:34.082 --> 14:37.752
Hope is going to be composting mulch
for a year when I find her.

14:38.503 --> 14:41.381
Just Hope? Not Iris or the others?

14:41.464 --> 14:42.799
You think Iris is behind this?

14:43.925 --> 14:45.260
I was in the weeds for a while.

14:46.928 --> 14:50.849
Who you are inside those walls
ain't who you are outside.

14:53.977 --> 14:54.853
You okay?

14:55.604 --> 14:56.438
Yup!

14:57.439 --> 14:58.273
Aces.

16:01.169 --> 16:02.420
What's with the spray paint?

16:02.754 --> 16:03.588
Science!

16:04.297 --> 16:08.259
I can continue Dr Bavolar's migration
experiments while on our journey.

16:08.343 --> 16:11.721
Track how the empties move, merge,
and break off from each other.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.349
Hey, maybe you can help me?

16:15.392 --> 16:16.226
Okay.

16:17.352 --> 16:18.978
Is... Is that an empty?

16:22.649 --> 16:24.067
What happened to it?

16:26.403 --> 16:27.237
You hear that?

16:35.954 --> 16:37.247
Let's get the hell out of here!

16:42.085 --> 16:43.211
Help, Silas!

16:45.630 --> 16:46.506
Hit it!

16:47.215 --> 16:48.049
Use the wrench!

17:08.778 --> 17:09.612
We lost it.

17:13.199 --> 17:14.367
Bummed you didn't kill it?

17:16.411 --> 17:17.245
Yeah.

17:18.663 --> 17:19.497
Don't be.

17:23.251 --> 17:25.920
Why did you try to kill yours?

17:28.840 --> 17:29.674
I had to.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.010
I'm the reason we're out here.

17:32.093 --> 17:34.179
And we'll all have to kill one
eventually.

17:36.473 --> 17:37.474
Hey, guys.

17:38.224 --> 17:40.059
Think that's our shelter
for the evening?

17:41.352 --> 17:43.396
Looks like
a whole lot of rooms to clear.

17:43.480 --> 17:45.398
Well, yes, but, not that.

17:46.149 --> 17:49.611
Why be on <i>terra firma</i>
when you can be on <i>summus locus</i> ?

17:50.987 --> 17:52.864
Hope, remember how
we begged Dad to build

17:52.947 --> 17:54.365
a tree house in the back yard?

17:54.991 --> 17:56.659
Yeah, I remember.

18:38.785 --> 18:39.702
Big Mo!

18:48.419 --> 18:49.254
Big Mo.

18:55.885 --> 18:56.719
Come on...

18:57.178 --> 18:59.347
Give him a helping hand
coming back home.

18:59.430 --> 19:00.265
He's cool.

19:04.727 --> 19:06.104
You got to say it when you do it.

19:11.526 --> 19:12.735
-Big--
-Come on, Silas!

19:13.361 --> 19:14.654
Loud and proud!

19:19.909 --> 19:20.910
Big Mo!

19:21.828 --> 19:22.662
Yeah!

19:41.639 --> 19:42.473
He found us?

19:51.649 --> 19:52.942
I'm sorry, guys.

19:53.026 --> 19:55.236
It's okay. We can
drop something on it. Um...

19:56.529 --> 19:57.530
Oh! Big Mo.

19:58.072 --> 20:00.700
Okay, okay. I will do it.

20:01.576 --> 20:02.452
We'll get him back.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.538
I just didn't want to crack
his glossy goodness.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.374
Taking the hit for us, <i>papi</i> .

20:16.799 --> 20:18.718
Ah, shit!

20:24.515 --> 20:26.559
There's got to be
something else in here.

20:29.604 --> 20:31.773
I'm... sorry.

20:32.482 --> 20:33.900
I should have killed it before.

20:34.525 --> 20:38.321
It's okay. Empties are supposed to
get distracted pretty easy.

20:38.947 --> 20:41.783
If it's still around in the morning,
we'll deal with it then.

20:45.536 --> 20:46.704
Oh, score!

20:50.667 --> 20:51.542
Now it's your turn.

20:51.626 --> 20:52.627
You just went?

20:57.090 --> 20:58.007
Getting doubles.

20:59.300 --> 21:00.343
I was meant to get, like--

21:00.426 --> 21:01.427
-Is that eight?
-Right.

21:01.928 --> 21:04.180
I don't have... I only have red ones.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.682
I'm not going to let you out.

21:05.765 --> 21:06.599
What was that?

21:06.683 --> 21:08.267
Twelve! That's the highest one.

21:12.188 --> 21:14.190
I'm going to buy that,
the Electric Company.

21:15.233 --> 21:16.067
Okay.

21:17.026 --> 21:18.403
I'm going to... I'm going to do this.

21:21.030 --> 21:22.573
Oh, that was almost doubles again.

22:50.369 --> 22:52.497
Come on. Come on, stud.

23:57.520 --> 23:58.354
Did...

23:59.021 --> 23:59.856
Did you...

24:00.773 --> 24:01.607
get rid of it?

24:04.819 --> 24:06.028
I didn't do anything.

24:11.242 --> 24:12.577
Th-thank you.

24:13.578 --> 24:16.080
That should have been me.
That was my mistake.

24:20.418 --> 24:21.502
It wasn't.

24:22.587 --> 24:24.088
But fine, say it was.

24:26.007 --> 24:28.301
It doesn't mean it has to
follow you around forever.

24:32.180 --> 24:34.515
Look, can we keep this
our little secret?

25:17.808 --> 25:19.060
What's up, Felix?

25:19.143 --> 25:22.480
Nothing, I...
I just used to live around here.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.280
Hope stole this from my apartment.

25:32.615 --> 25:35.451
You'd think they'd do a better job
of covering up their tracks.

25:35.534 --> 25:36.786
You'd think they would, huh?

25:37.787 --> 25:38.621
Come on.

25:50.466 --> 25:51.300
Well?

26:19.704 --> 26:23.624
You wanted to take a look, we took
a look, and what I saw was crazy.

26:25.584 --> 26:26.419
It's big.

26:27.044 --> 26:27.878
Quite big.

26:31.299 --> 26:32.341
I think we can do this.

26:34.510 --> 26:36.804
The map says there's an airfield
on the other side.

26:36.887 --> 26:38.097
It's surrounded by a fence,

26:38.180 --> 26:41.726
which means the empties coming
from the east have to go around it.

26:41.809 --> 26:44.061
That leaves us
a clear path to go through.

26:44.145 --> 26:47.064
We just have to go due east,
then we're home free.

26:47.148 --> 26:48.941
What about the ones before the fence?

26:52.111 --> 26:53.404
It's all about evasion.

26:53.988 --> 26:56.574
It's like what Felix taught us
in self-defense class:

26:56.657 --> 26:59.118
the key isn't fighting,
it's avoiding.

27:00.077 --> 27:02.330
We can sneak past them
and use the buses for cover.

27:02.413 --> 27:05.041
Um, did you guys see
the same screwed-up shit that I did?

27:05.124 --> 27:07.585
We've had two close encounters
with empties already

27:07.668 --> 27:10.546
and we barely made it past them.
Two of them.

27:11.630 --> 27:14.300
Come on, guys.
Let's put our brains back in.

27:17.386 --> 27:18.637
If we go around,

27:21.265 --> 27:25.186
we'll probably get caught,
and I can't go back.

27:27.313 --> 27:28.147
Seconded.

27:29.899 --> 27:33.611
I came out here to see
what the world is. Start to finish.

27:34.945 --> 27:36.864
I don't intend to finish
before I start.

27:44.372 --> 27:45.623
Blaze of Glory, right guys?

27:46.832 --> 27:48.125
It'll be dark soon.

27:48.209 --> 27:52.338
If we leave at dawn, shadows will
be long and we'll have more cover.

27:59.553 --> 28:03.432
Holy God. The air
tastes like a skid mark.

28:03.516 --> 28:07.645
That's the tire fire. We're close.
Which means they are too.

28:07.728 --> 28:09.563
They should hit The Blaze tomorrow.

28:10.523 --> 28:13.651
We can afford to rest.
We're going on 48 hours.

28:13.734 --> 28:15.569
-I'm fine.
-You're not.

28:15.653 --> 28:17.279
You're not even thinking right.

28:17.363 --> 28:20.699
We don't rest, we get whupped
by the janitor kid when we find them.

28:22.576 --> 28:23.994
Hey, Huck.

28:31.419 --> 28:32.753
I swear to God.

28:35.381 --> 28:36.257
Huck.

28:37.383 --> 28:39.385
I get it. You're worried for them.

28:39.927 --> 28:42.763
But if you don't clear your head
and start thinking big picture,

28:43.681 --> 28:46.559
you'll end up with one of these.
Or worse.

28:59.822 --> 29:01.073
So you're not going to sleep,

29:01.157 --> 29:02.908
and you're not going to tell me
what's up.

29:03.409 --> 29:04.243
Great.

29:05.536 --> 29:06.370
You know...

29:08.372 --> 29:10.124
you were out in the wild for years,

29:10.541 --> 29:13.169
and you barely said two words
about it. You know that, right?

29:14.211 --> 29:16.505
I got my rep
as the strong, silent type

29:16.589 --> 29:17.631
to think about.

29:20.634 --> 29:23.012
And besides,
the past is the past, you know.

29:30.436 --> 29:31.312
I was, uh...

29:34.648 --> 29:35.941
I was at the University.

29:37.109 --> 29:38.235
The Night the Sky Fell.

29:42.156 --> 29:44.825
Yeah. You mentioned that.

29:48.996 --> 29:51.081
As soon as it started to get bad,
I just...

29:52.833 --> 29:53.792
I just took off.

29:55.294 --> 29:57.379
I... I had to.

30:00.132 --> 30:03.010
Just to get back to them. You know?

30:05.346 --> 30:06.514
Get back to my family.

30:12.269 --> 30:14.104
I just wanted to see
if they were okay.

30:16.440 --> 30:18.442
See if I could just be with them
at the end.

30:27.826 --> 30:28.744
It took two days.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.164
Mostly by foot.

30:36.085 --> 30:36.919
I get it.

30:38.128 --> 30:39.880
They might have been shitty parents,

30:40.965 --> 30:42.424
but they're still your parents.

30:49.139 --> 30:50.099
Did you make it back?

31:03.404 --> 31:04.530
Mom! Dad!

31:14.915 --> 31:15.749
Mom!

31:16.500 --> 31:19.461
Dad! Just let me help you
get somewhere safe.

31:20.379 --> 31:21.797
We don't need your help.

31:22.339 --> 31:24.967
Come on, Mom! I'm home!

31:46.196 --> 31:47.573
It doesn't matter.

31:49.408 --> 31:50.784
The past is the past, right?

31:51.368 --> 31:52.953
Yeah, it is.

31:55.247 --> 31:58.042
Hey. Get some sleep, Huck.

31:58.125 --> 31:59.877
You ain't got to tell me twice.

32:15.684 --> 32:17.645
Got about a half hour until sunup.

32:33.619 --> 32:35.412
Your and Iris's jackets look spiffy.

32:36.205 --> 32:38.040
Silas fixed them so they'd fit us.

32:39.416 --> 32:41.335
His grandma taught him how to sew.

32:43.003 --> 32:43.837
Who knew?

32:48.926 --> 32:50.344
Hey, can I ask you something?

32:52.596 --> 32:56.266
Does it bother you that we're
going to end up like the dinosaurs?

32:58.268 --> 32:59.186
Does it bother you?

33:02.064 --> 33:04.274
I think I always knew
it was going to go that way.

33:04.775 --> 33:05.901
Or at least, since...

33:07.111 --> 33:09.822
Wait. Are you dodging?

33:10.614 --> 33:13.283
No! No, I was just curious.

33:16.203 --> 33:17.204
It doesn't bother me.

33:19.164 --> 33:20.207
Just the opposite.

33:20.290 --> 33:22.459
There had to have been
a last generation.

33:23.043 --> 33:25.629
I just wonder if they knew
they were the end,

33:25.713 --> 33:27.005
were therefore special.

33:29.758 --> 33:31.301
We're the last generation?

33:32.219 --> 33:33.345
Or the endlings,

33:35.180 --> 33:37.808
as the last of a species is called.

33:40.060 --> 33:41.395
That makes us special.

33:42.146 --> 33:43.188
I'm lucky to know that.

33:45.482 --> 33:48.527
To know that
I need to make my life count.

33:50.946 --> 33:52.030
It's all I can do.

33:52.781 --> 33:54.366
Really, it's all any of us can do.

33:56.660 --> 33:57.745
We're the endlings.

34:02.124 --> 34:03.292
Endlings, huh?

34:03.375 --> 34:06.795
Actually, I misspoke.
We aren't the endlings.

34:07.713 --> 34:11.925
The last member of a species,
the very last one, that's an endling.

34:15.220 --> 34:17.181
Of this faux species,

34:17.681 --> 34:21.185
that is our quartet
crossing the continent,

34:21.268 --> 34:22.519
the last one alive,

34:23.937 --> 34:24.980
they're the endling.

34:28.192 --> 34:29.651
And it's their life,

34:30.944 --> 34:31.945
their death,

34:32.613 --> 34:34.156
that defines us all.

34:44.917 --> 34:45.959
Does that bother you?

34:52.883 --> 34:53.717
Yeah.

35:09.149 --> 35:12.653
We should get going soon.
The sun will start to rise.

35:14.112 --> 35:14.947
Yeah.

35:15.405 --> 35:16.240
Oh, um...

35:17.991 --> 35:19.618
Do you still have the spray paint?

35:19.952 --> 35:20.786
Yeah.

36:20.304 --> 36:21.263
Jesus.

36:22.556 --> 36:23.682
I was out like a light.

36:26.602 --> 36:27.477
You sleep at all?

36:28.437 --> 36:31.315
No. No, I couldn't if I wanted to.

36:39.531 --> 36:40.407
Too bad.

36:40.490 --> 36:41.533
Yeah. We should go.

37:24.493 --> 37:25.786
We need to keep moving east.

37:51.478 --> 37:54.481
That's it. That's our way out.
But we'll have to go around them.

37:55.190 --> 37:56.441
So much for east.

38:09.705 --> 38:12.332
Knowing where you are going
is everything.

38:17.838 --> 38:22.092
Now, if you know what time it is,
you got a compass in the sky.

38:33.353 --> 38:36.356
Now you lose that,
you're flying blind.

39:32.454 --> 39:33.371
Keep moving.

39:54.184 --> 39:56.061
<i>This isn't about</i>
<i>standing your ground.</i>

39:57.020 --> 39:58.897
This is about survival.

40:03.860 --> 40:06.822
Sometimes, you don't
get to choose your direction.

40:08.406 --> 40:09.533
Where's the fence?

40:09.616 --> 40:10.450
I can't see it.

40:12.744 --> 40:15.080
Sometimes, you don't get to know
where you're going.

40:20.168 --> 40:21.044
There it is.

40:21.128 --> 40:21.962
It's this way!

41:06.923 --> 41:08.967
It's okay. We did it.

41:11.720 --> 41:12.554
We made it.

41:20.437 --> 41:21.271
What the hell?

41:31.323 --> 41:32.324
We didn't do it.

41:33.700 --> 41:35.035
Not even close.

41:38.121 --> 41:39.122
"The Endlings"?

41:39.706 --> 41:41.249
They got themselves a nickname.

41:41.833 --> 41:43.251
She wants us to find them.

41:44.461 --> 41:45.503
Iris or Hope?

41:45.587 --> 41:46.546
Ah, I don't know.

41:47.839 --> 41:49.883
Obviously one of them
doesn't want to do this.

41:50.675 --> 41:51.927
One of them wants our help.

41:52.844 --> 41:53.803
So let's get them.

41:59.893 --> 42:01.478
Yo! Keep up.

42:02.270 --> 42:04.314
I'm not letting you sneak off
like last night.

42:05.649 --> 42:06.483
Felix!

43:00.412 --> 43:01.663
Mom! Dad!

43:05.458 --> 43:08.086
Come on, Mom! I'm home!

43:49.544 --> 43:51.796
Will you tell me
where you went last night?

43:52.464 --> 43:53.923
To kill my parents.

44:07.937 --> 44:10.190
The airfield must be
behind the rest of The Blaze.

44:11.608 --> 44:14.903
I should have known
there'd be a "rest of The Blaze".

44:15.945 --> 44:18.365
It was behind the smoke, alright?
None of us saw it.

44:21.743 --> 44:23.745
I'm going to propose
something unpopular,

44:23.828 --> 44:25.830
but it might be
the only "something" we have.

44:27.123 --> 44:29.209
There's an old tornado siren
on that roof.

44:29.292 --> 44:32.087
If somebody could sound it,
it could create a nice diversion

44:32.170 --> 44:33.171
for the others.

44:33.630 --> 44:34.547
For the others?

44:35.340 --> 44:38.802
The idea is that whoever sounds the
siren will be able to get down too.

44:40.387 --> 44:42.639
You want to send someone in as bait?

44:42.722 --> 44:45.266
No! No, no not as bait, more like...

44:46.810 --> 44:47.644
It's bait, yeah.

44:47.727 --> 44:49.854
-But I don't want to, at all, okay?
-It's too dangerous.

44:49.938 --> 44:52.482
We all came in, we all come out.

44:56.069 --> 44:57.487
But how?

45:01.282 --> 45:02.117
Iris.

45:03.451 --> 45:05.245
You were right to question me.

45:05.995 --> 45:07.664
I thought I was ready for this.

45:09.332 --> 45:11.126
I wanted to be brave.

45:12.710 --> 45:14.546
I wanted to be more like you.

45:15.422 --> 45:16.548
I'm not brave.

45:17.966 --> 45:19.634
I'm a shit person
who does shit things

45:19.717 --> 45:21.970
because I don't give
a single shit about anything.

45:22.345 --> 45:23.972
-That's not true.
-Yes, it is!

45:26.558 --> 45:29.060
You had the guts to do something big.

45:29.144 --> 45:30.145
Something crazy,

45:30.228 --> 45:33.857
something that meant something,
and not just to you but all of us.

45:35.900 --> 45:36.860
You should be proud,

45:38.319 --> 45:39.362
