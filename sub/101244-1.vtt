00:19.790 --> 00:24.368
In the spring of 1956, Archangel Films,

00:24.370 --> 00:28.518
a landmark studio located
in Culver City, California,

00:28.520 --> 00:32.497
produced a science fiction
movie of such immense scope,

00:32.500 --> 00:35.406
it was said it would eclipse anything

00:35.408 --> 00:38.383
yet seen on the silver screen.

00:39.630 --> 00:42.108
Mr. Archibald Angel,
Chairman of the studio held

00:42.110 --> 00:43.718
a private screening of this film

00:43.720 --> 00:46.018
for a select group of shareholders.

00:46.020 --> 00:48.688
Reportedly, the movie earned its title

00:48.690 --> 00:52.368
when the VIP's screamed
out, "Unbelievable,"

00:52.370 --> 00:55.478
on several occasions
during the first reel.

00:55.480 --> 00:57.658
It was then that Mr. Angel allegedly

00:57.660 --> 01:01.918
went berserk trying to
set fire to the film.

01:01.920 --> 01:05.257
In the early morning
hours of April 13th, 1956,

01:05.260 --> 01:08.308
the entire studio burned
to the ground and those

01:08.310 --> 01:13.310
who had seen the movie tragically
perished in the flames.

01:15.780 --> 01:18.115
Incredibly, one of the only items

01:18.117 --> 01:22.738
to survive the fire was the film itself.

01:22.740 --> 01:24.538
Inside one of the metal canisters

01:24.540 --> 01:29.468
was a note Mr. Angel wrote to his wife,

01:29.470 --> 01:34.178
making her promise not to show anyone

01:34.180 --> 01:37.565
the movie until quote,

01:37.567 --> 01:42.207
"It decomposes into a
mass of gelatinous goo."

01:44.380 --> 01:45.958
After she recently passed away,

01:45.960 --> 01:48.998
film preservationists were astounded

01:49.000 --> 01:51.518
to discover this cinematic treasure

01:51.520 --> 01:54.278
at a garage sale in Bel Air.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.878
Purchased for the sum of $3,

01:55.880 --> 01:58.948
it has been restored
to its original luster

01:58.950 --> 02:02.934
and it's now ready to be
presented to the world.

02:09.800 --> 02:12.888
Produced before computerized
special effects,

02:12.890 --> 02:14.858
and bloated production budgets,

02:14.860 --> 02:19.293
it is a true reflection of
Hollywood during its Golden Age.

02:20.530 --> 02:23.593
You will be among the
first to see this movie.

02:25.040 --> 02:27.428
Lost for more than 50 years,

02:27.430 --> 02:29.948
it is my distinct pleasure to present

02:29.950 --> 02:32.790
the world premier of, "Unbelievable!!!!!"

02:51.740 --> 02:54.358
If you stare at it
for another five hours,

02:54.360 --> 02:55.753
I'm sure they'll call.

02:57.850 --> 03:00.138
The studio's not interested.

03:00.140 --> 03:03.718
How could they treat us
like this after all we did?

03:03.720 --> 03:06.798
We don't appeal to their demographic.

03:06.800 --> 03:09.407
Live long and prosper my ass.

03:10.692 --> 03:12.888
I say let's wake this town up.

03:12.890 --> 03:14.610
How do you plan to do that?

03:15.570 --> 03:16.688
With this.

03:16.690 --> 03:17.838
A lousy script?

03:17.840 --> 03:18.838
What's it about?

03:18.840 --> 03:20.803
It's like "Airplane!" only funnier,

03:21.640 --> 03:24.238
or "Spaceballs" but ballsier.

03:24.240 --> 03:25.690
But who's gonna produce it?

03:28.075 --> 03:29.378
- Us?
- Come on.

03:29.380 --> 03:30.888
We know a lot of people.

03:30.890 --> 03:35.408
Most everyone I know is
either here or at Forest Lawn.

03:36.390 --> 03:38.018
I'll tell you who we need.

03:38.020 --> 03:39.138
We need Kirk.

03:39.140 --> 03:40.988
Kirk, are you kidding?

03:40.990 --> 03:41.988
Is he still alive?

03:41.990 --> 03:43.308
Better than alive.

03:43.310 --> 03:44.878
He's immortal.

03:44.880 --> 03:45.978
What the hell?

03:45.980 --> 03:49.018
Don't tell me he sold his
soul to the Weinstein's?

03:49.020 --> 03:50.708
Nope, rumor has it he went

03:50.710 --> 03:53.268
to the best plastic surgeon in town.

03:53.270 --> 03:55.558
He's been vacuu-formed.

03:55.560 --> 03:56.747
Get him on the phone.

04:08.700 --> 04:10.388
Yeah, this is Kirk.

04:10.390 --> 04:11.223
Who's this?

04:12.400 --> 04:13.231
Oh, yes.

04:13.233 --> 04:15.253
Always glad to hear
from the little people.

04:16.120 --> 04:17.447
What's that?

04:17.450 --> 04:19.423
You want me to do your film?

04:20.500 --> 04:23.043
Well, my normal day rate's six figures.

04:24.570 --> 04:25.697
Scale?

04:26.565 --> 04:27.396
No.

04:27.398 --> 04:28.428
No.

04:28.430 --> 04:31.638
Listen, when they find a
cure for Alzheimer's, call me.

04:31.640 --> 04:32.826
Daddy, we want a role.

04:32.828 --> 04:34.258
- Yes.
- Please.

04:34.260 --> 04:35.351
- Yeah?
- Oh, I want a role.

04:35.353 --> 04:37.155
- Okay, If you want me,
- Please.

04:37.157 --> 04:40.206
you have to give all my
girls roles in the film.

04:40.208 --> 04:41.490
Oh, yay!

04:42.417 --> 04:44.258
And my pony gets some face time, too.

04:44.260 --> 04:46.898
You know how I love horses.

04:46.900 --> 04:47.731
Okay.

04:47.733 --> 04:48.834
Okay, we got a deal.

04:48.836 --> 04:50.836
- Good, good.
- Thank you!

07:13.842 --> 07:16.259
Two games left.

07:27.360 --> 07:29.360
Do you have to strut around like that?

07:31.520 --> 07:32.408
I've been stranded here

07:32.410 --> 07:34.728
for six months with no hairdresser,

07:34.730 --> 07:36.458
no manicures, no masseuse.

07:36.460 --> 07:38.760
The least I can do is
keep my tan from fading.

07:39.650 --> 07:41.587
Well, I'm not sure my
fiance would approve.

07:41.589 --> 07:43.688
Please.

07:43.690 --> 07:45.858
You're as bad as that
fruity husband of mine.

07:45.860 --> 07:47.448
The only time I get a rise out of you

07:47.450 --> 07:49.108
is when you want a beer.

07:49.110 --> 07:52.288
Well, I could use a
cold one right about now.

07:52.290 --> 07:53.348
Dream on, Jack.

07:53.350 --> 07:55.665
I drank the last of it three weeks ago.

07:58.620 --> 08:00.423
Are you expecting someone?

08:00.425 --> 08:02.123
Must be a Jehovah's Witness.

08:03.520 --> 08:04.813
Tell 'em to hit the road.

08:16.670 --> 08:18.068
What's with you?

08:18.070 --> 08:19.908
It was...

08:19.910 --> 08:20.820
I saw a...

08:22.112 --> 08:22.945
It looked like a bush!

08:26.329 --> 08:29.362
Well, get a bikini wax.

08:29.364 --> 08:32.158
No, it's scraggly and green.

08:32.159 --> 08:35.541
Well, that's a little more
information than I need.

08:35.543 --> 08:36.798
And your personal problems should

08:36.799 --> 08:38.943
be shared between you and your husband.

08:40.020 --> 08:40.852
You hear me?

08:43.049 --> 08:43.880
Cheryl?

08:47.108 --> 08:47.941
Cheryl?

08:49.760 --> 08:51.151
Oh my God!

08:51.153 --> 08:53.808
It's all over her body.

08:53.810 --> 08:56.874
She must've caught some
extraterrestrial STD.

08:59.550 --> 09:00.381
Oh, holy herpes!

09:00.383 --> 09:02.202
I've got it, too.

09:02.204 --> 09:04.895
Why in the hell did I wash
her panties with mine?

09:04.897 --> 09:06.412
Oh no!

09:06.414 --> 09:08.281
It's spreading!

09:08.283 --> 09:09.116
Oh!

09:10.610 --> 09:12.223
Hi, Miss Hastings?

09:13.730 --> 09:14.563
Yeah?

09:15.440 --> 09:19.688
I'm Private Durwood, radio operator 171,

09:19.690 --> 09:21.143
reporting for A.S.S duty.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.528
Contact Lunar Base.

09:24.530 --> 09:25.363
Yes, Ma'am.

09:30.250 --> 09:34.808
Lunar Base, this is
Mission Control in Houston.

09:34.810 --> 09:36.548
Do you read Lunar Base?

09:36.550 --> 09:37.978
Do you read me Lunar Base?

09:37.980 --> 09:39.678
Do you read?

09:39.680 --> 09:40.548
Over.

09:40.550 --> 09:42.006
They still can't read?

09:42.008 --> 09:44.688
Yeah, why can't we train
them to be more polite?

09:44.690 --> 09:45.773
What do you think?

09:47.230 --> 09:48.808
I guess I don't think.

09:48.810 --> 09:51.147
And that's why we hired you, Dillwood.

09:52.145 --> 09:53.258
It's Durwood.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.133
Yeah, whatever.

09:56.350 --> 09:57.183
Okay.

09:59.550 --> 10:00.381
Sorry.

10:00.383 --> 10:01.491
Should I just keep contacting them?

10:01.493 --> 10:04.808
Just keep
contacting the Lunar Base.

10:04.810 --> 10:05.643
Oh!

10:07.417 --> 10:08.867
It's my first day.

10:11.180 --> 10:12.480
Aunt Jemima.

10:15.774 --> 10:19.225
Oh, smiley face emoticon.

10:19.227 --> 10:20.597
Mrs. Butterworth!

10:22.300 --> 10:23.688
Tatty Tayle here, reporting

10:23.690 --> 10:26.358
from Captain Kirk Stillwood's ready room.

10:26.360 --> 10:29.168
It's been quiet here
for the past few hours.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.670
The Space Agency's always
been open with the press,

10:31.672 --> 10:35.748
but with this launch, A.S.S.
has become incredibly tight.

10:35.750 --> 10:37.608
Hey, put a sock in it.

10:37.610 --> 10:39.788
Some of us are trying to sleep.

10:39.790 --> 10:40.718
Sorry.

10:40.720 --> 10:42.111
Let's see what happens next.

10:46.653 --> 10:49.058
Amber, where did you come from?

10:49.060 --> 10:50.291
Well, I came from the launch site

10:50.293 --> 10:51.718
if that's what you're asking.

10:51.720 --> 10:52.628
Hello?

10:52.630 --> 10:53.898
Aren't you forgetting to mention

10:53.900 --> 10:55.830
the 800 pound doughnut in the room?

10:55.832 --> 10:56.663
THE GARDENER OF FRICKIN'
FOREVER: Whoa, whoa,

10:56.665 --> 10:57.848
whoa, whoa, whoa, pally, okay?

10:57.850 --> 10:58.948
I'm not a doughnut.

10:58.950 --> 11:00.938
I am The Gardener of Frickin' Forever.

11:00.940 --> 11:03.928
You jacked that thing like 50 years ago.

11:03.930 --> 11:06.128
Oh, stealing an artifact
from another world

11:06.130 --> 11:07.838
is against the prime derivative.

11:07.840 --> 11:10.398
I'd rather hollow out my
eyes with a rusty corkscrew

11:10.400 --> 11:12.508
than violate that sacred law.

11:12.510 --> 11:13.708
THE GARDENER OF FRICKIN'
FOREVER: This putz,

11:13.710 --> 11:16.358
this narcissistic putz!

11:16.360 --> 11:17.528
It'll take him frickin' forever

11:17.530 --> 11:20.848
to admit he's a full on kleptomaniac.

11:20.850 --> 11:22.468
Where did you get those cribbles?

11:22.470 --> 11:23.968
- Oh, that's Nay Nay
- I'm Nay Nay.

11:23.970 --> 11:25.758
and that's Tay Tay,

11:25.760 --> 11:26.848
- space groupies.
- I'm Tay Tay.

11:26.850 --> 11:27.731
They mean nothing to me.

11:29.153 --> 11:30.778
Hey, you two shut it.

11:30.780 --> 11:31.908
- Boy!
- Stop makin' a scene.

11:31.910 --> 11:34.098
- Quiet!
- Boogie my block.

11:34.100 --> 11:35.318
We're ready for launch.

11:35.320 --> 11:38.263
Just, please try to make everything look

11:38.265 --> 11:40.798
as routine as possible, okay?

11:40.800 --> 11:43.818
You must think I'm one
hell of an actor, huh?

11:43.820 --> 11:45.578
In your wettest of dreams, Kirk.

11:45.580 --> 11:47.448
You know, if something
goes wrong up there,

11:47.450 --> 11:50.138
this'll be the end of the program.

11:50.140 --> 11:52.478
Well, I thought we
had 80 more minutes...

11:52.480 --> 11:53.598
Oh, that program.

11:53.600 --> 11:54.431
Oh.

11:54.433 --> 11:56.598
Before you leave, somebody
wants to debrief you.

11:56.600 --> 11:59.728
Oh Amber, I've told you
1,000 times, I'm straight.

11:59.730 --> 12:01.833
Why won't anyone believe me?

12:04.010 --> 12:06.348
So, I like sweaty puppets on steroids.

12:06.350 --> 12:08.487
Does that make me weird?

12:08.489 --> 12:10.185
You can come in now.

12:10.187 --> 12:11.018
THE GARDENER OF
FRICKIN' FOREVER: I can be

12:11.020 --> 12:13.578
a gateway to your own past.

12:13.580 --> 12:17.068
All you gotta do is say the
word and I'll be your gateway.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.718
Now, many such journeys are possible.

12:18.720 --> 12:22.068
Just enter and allow me to show you

12:22.070 --> 12:23.891
The Gardener of Frickin'
Forever, to show you...

12:25.525 --> 12:26.554
Damn it!

12:26.556 --> 12:28.737
I didn't have time to finish the shpeel.

12:28.739 --> 12:30.788
To all inferior creatures,

12:30.790 --> 12:32.566
I bring great tidings of joy.

12:32.568 --> 12:36.928
His Holiest of Holies will
be amongst you in seconds.

12:36.930 --> 12:38.128
This is interesting.

12:38.130 --> 12:40.585
Maybe we can get some
real news for a change.

13:24.932 --> 13:26.480
Greetings.

13:26.482 --> 13:27.988
Shizzle my nizzle.

13:27.990 --> 13:30.898
Before you stands the most righteous,

13:30.900 --> 13:34.933
the most spectacular Major LeGrande Bushe,

13:36.620 --> 13:40.901
here for you to obey, honor,

13:40.903 --> 13:45.903
bow down, to kneel before,
you lame ass humans.

13:48.240 --> 13:49.138
You may proceed.

13:49.140 --> 13:50.666
Oh, Tay Tay.

13:50.668 --> 13:53.261
LeGrande Bushe!

13:53.263 --> 13:55.128
- Oh!
- Well, hello ladies.

13:55.130 --> 13:58.076
Climb onboard the good ship, Bushe,

13:58.078 --> 13:59.497
- for a ride like
- Oh, Nay Nay!

13:59.499 --> 14:00.330
you've never known.

14:01.470 --> 14:03.818
Hey, find your own women, pal.

14:03.820 --> 14:05.308
So you're Tay Tay,

14:05.310 --> 14:06.728
and you're Nay Nay,

14:06.730 --> 14:09.003
or are you Nay Nay and you Tay Tay?

14:10.050 --> 14:15.050
Gets a bit confused since
you're so luscious, both of you.

14:15.300 --> 14:16.608
You'll be sorry.

14:16.610 --> 14:17.848
Why is that my man?

14:17.850 --> 14:19.428
'Cause their sister for Va-Jay Jay

14:19.430 --> 14:21.167
was the only one born female.

14:24.801 --> 14:26.213
Oh, now who?

14:27.280 --> 14:30.173
That would be my most
awesome military aid.

14:31.220 --> 14:35.433
I present, Captain Buttock Snortz.

14:54.974 --> 14:56.100
I am Buttock,

14:56.102 --> 14:58.718
Captain of the spaceship, Facetious,

14:58.720 --> 15:01.438
from the First Federation
of the second nation,

15:01.440 --> 15:03.498
to the third conglomeration.

15:03.500 --> 15:05.598
You are obviously primitive creatures

15:05.600 --> 15:07.558
who have no reason to live.

15:07.560 --> 15:09.245
Yet, the great and powerful Bushe

15:09.247 --> 15:11.578
has graced you with his presence.

15:11.580 --> 15:12.978
Honor this opportunity

15:12.980 --> 15:16.588
or you shall certainly perish
in everlasting torment.

15:16.590 --> 15:17.825
I never forget a face.

15:17.827 --> 15:21.068
Didn't you destroy the
Star Ship Constipation?

15:21.070 --> 15:22.005
Silence!

15:26.240 --> 15:27.238
Whoa.

15:27.240 --> 15:28.618
Excuse you.

15:28.620 --> 15:30.008
Refrain from speaking

15:30.010 --> 15:33.128
when the great and powerful
Bushe is addressing you.

15:33.130 --> 15:35.438
Thank you, Captain Snortz.

15:35.440 --> 15:37.538
Yo Pups, the Lunar Base has been

15:37.540 --> 15:39.680
on the down low for the past two weeks.

15:39.682 --> 15:43.118
Nobody knows squat about
our homies up there.

15:43.120 --> 15:45.308
We don't know why they took a powder,

15:45.310 --> 15:47.528
but this Star Trekker voice,

15:47.530 --> 15:51.008
it's gotta look completely routine.

15:51.010 --> 15:53.268
There's nothing routine
about our routine...

15:53.270 --> 15:54.787
Shut your hole.

15:55.622 --> 15:56.455
Oh hell no!

15:57.512 --> 16:01.048
Can I get a PA to
bring me a towel please?

16:01.050 --> 16:02.588
Is that really necessary?

16:02.590 --> 16:03.978
- Oh!
- Nasty.

16:03.980 --> 16:06.568
Just who do you think you are?

16:06.570 --> 16:09.238
Well, lil homie, I'm really an alien

16:09.240 --> 16:11.811
here to take over the world.

16:11.813 --> 16:16.528
So, how did you get here
on our planet, the Earth?

16:16.530 --> 16:21.068
Well, we arrived in a 5,000
mile long mothership fool.

16:21.070 --> 16:23.175
It's double parked on
the backside of the Moon.

16:24.340 --> 16:26.118
That's very funny, Major.

16:26.120 --> 16:28.208
If this alien thing
doesn't work out for you,

16:28.210 --> 16:30.648
you've always got a future in stand-up.

16:30.650 --> 16:31.481
Insolence!

16:33.490 --> 16:34.321
Damn it, Bones.

16:34.323 --> 16:36.045
I'm a captain, not an exorcist.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.758
That's just
another demonstration

16:39.760 --> 16:41.338
of our superiority.

16:41.340 --> 16:45.706
Well, it's been fun,
but we have to get going.

16:51.250 --> 16:53.748
These stupid ass humans.

16:53.750 --> 16:55.510
Soon I will take over the planet

16:56.680 --> 16:58.407
with my army of plants.

17:04.130 --> 17:06.826
Damn, you got some big
teeth, Captain Snortz.

17:06.828 --> 17:08.795
I'm
big all over, Major.

17:13.380 --> 17:14.211
Yeah.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.108
Let's roll a blunt.

17:19.109 --> 17:20.708
This is the launchman.

17:20.710 --> 17:25.108
Launch T-minus four hours,
22 minutes and counting.

17:25.109 --> 17:27.978
Clear the launch area immediately.

17:27.980 --> 17:30.488
All authorized personnel are requested

17:30.490 --> 17:32.388
to leave the launch site.

17:32.390 --> 17:33.978
All unauthorized personnel

17:33.980 --> 17:35.783
can do whatever the hell they want.

17:39.080 --> 17:39.913
Hello?

17:42.277 --> 17:44.113
Yeah, we'll accept the charges.

17:48.380 --> 17:50.023
Yeah, she's right here.

17:51.080 --> 17:52.883
It's Amber Earhardt for you.

17:58.297 --> 17:59.738
Ah!

18:02.510 --> 18:03.668
Hey, Amber girl.

18:03.670 --> 18:05.318
Did you get any last night?

18:05.320 --> 18:07.108
Let's not go there.

18:07.110 --> 18:10.370
Hey, what's the deal with that Bushe?

18:10.372 --> 18:12.068
Oh, Bushe.

18:12.070 --> 18:14.248
I thought you said you
didn't wanna go there.

18:14.250 --> 18:16.591
No, I meant the Major who briefed us.

18:16.593 --> 18:20.158
He looked like he was
growing out of his clothes

18:20.160 --> 18:22.168
like some sort of a weed.

18:22.170 --> 18:23.518
What the hell?

18:23.520 --> 18:26.618
I'll contact the personnel
director and see what she knows.

18:26.620 --> 18:29.733
Keep the press canned though
and everything will be a-okay.

18:31.130 --> 18:31.963
Okay.

18:33.390 --> 18:34.858
Is there trouble?

18:34.860 --> 18:36.405
What do you think?

18:36.407 --> 18:38.238
I don't think.

18:38.240 --> 18:41.833
And that's why you make
the big bucks, Dagwood.

18:43.481 --> 18:44.738
It's Durwood.

18:44.740 --> 18:47.031
Yeah, close enough.

18:48.410 --> 18:49.720
Joe Durwood!

18:52.591 --> 18:54.355
Durwood.

19:44.831 --> 19:47.358
Clear the
launch area immediately.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.333
Clear the launch area immediately.

20:11.880 --> 20:15.468
Oo, we have leaks in
five primary systems.

20:15.470 --> 20:17.888
Our fuel line is ruptured and we have loss

20:17.890 --> 20:19.968
of power in our life support batteries.

20:19.970 --> 20:21.643
Can you override?

20:25.130 --> 20:25.963
It's a go!

20:27.512 --> 20:28.968
What time is it?

20:28.970 --> 20:31.290
27 minutes to launch.

20:32.560 --> 20:33.428
How much longer?

20:33.430 --> 20:36.086
Mm, just under 10 minutes.

20:39.540 --> 20:40.627
Why are you so nervous?

20:40.629 --> 20:43.600
'Cause I built this
piece of crap!

20:50.623 --> 20:52.193
This isn't givin' me
a lot of confidence.

20:52.195 --> 20:53.828
I'm surprised you have any at all.

20:53.830 --> 20:55.328
Oh, I can't stand this.

20:55.330 --> 20:56.290
What time is it?

21:08.460 --> 21:10.868
We leave in two minutes.

21:10.870 --> 21:12.618
Let me now acquaint you with

21:12.620 --> 21:15.208
the various safety
features aboard our craft.

21:15.210 --> 21:17.048
We have life vests under your seats

21:17.050 --> 21:20.043
and inflatable rafts over both coat racks.

21:21.230 --> 21:24.913
We're down to one
minute, T-minus 60 seconds.

21:26.738 --> 21:30.453
Yeah, lemme get a large pepperoni
and onion, light cheese.

21:32.834 --> 21:34.073
Everything is a go.

21:35.050 --> 21:36.223
T-minus 40 seconds.

21:38.160 --> 21:39.328
Yeah, my number?

21:39.330 --> 21:44.330
Yeah, it's 987-654-3210.

21:47.085 --> 21:48.210
No, not yet!

21:56.990 --> 21:57.823
Oh.

21:58.900 --> 21:59.733
Oh, damn.

22:01.120 --> 22:03.163
Oh, I'm so blamin' this on someone else.

22:05.460 --> 22:08.228
Yeah, no, I'm gonna pick that up.

22:08.230 --> 22:09.788
Yeah, no, no, I'm comin' now.

22:09.790 --> 22:11.045
Oh, yeah, thanks.

22:17.362 --> 22:18.193
Whoa!

22:21.407 --> 22:22.238
Warp speed.

22:30.180 --> 22:31.966
Don't flush till we're over the ocean.

22:37.480 --> 22:38.821
Good thing I changed my underwear.

22:40.640 --> 22:41.471
What's wrong?

22:41.473 --> 22:44.208
Well, for starters I'm being chased

22:44.210 --> 22:46.118
around the block house by an alien.

22:46.120 --> 22:48.038
Oh, don't jump to conclusions.

22:48.040 --> 22:48.871
Are you sure

22:48.873 --> 22:49.704
- it's an alien, Amber?
- Go away!

22:49.706 --> 22:52.428
Well, it's ugly and it's
disgusting and green.

22:52.430 --> 22:55.328
Ew, it's roots are outrunning me.

22:55.330 --> 22:56.628
Don't panic.

22:56.630 --> 22:58.528
We've gotta keep a lid on this.

22:58.530 --> 22:59.878
Now if the press finds out we have

22:59.880 --> 23:03.188
an alien running around the block house,

23:03.190 --> 23:05.451
we'll never get another dime.

23:05.453 --> 23:06.284
Oh!

23:06.286 --> 23:07.775
But, but...

23:07.777 --> 23:09.346
Yeah, yeah, don't worry.

23:09.348 --> 23:10.308
- Stop it!
- Don't worry,

23:10.310 --> 23:13.060
- Stop it!
- I'll get back to you.

23:13.898 --> 23:14.729
Aliens?

23:15.716 --> 23:16.798
Yeah.

23:16.800 --> 23:17.843
What do you think?

23:19.819 --> 23:20.929
I don't think.

23:20.931 --> 23:24.668
And therefore you don't exist, Deadwood.

23:24.670 --> 23:26.258
- It's Durwood.
- Get back down there.

23:26.260 --> 23:28.310
Okay.

23:28.312 --> 23:29.143
Oo.

23:36.440 --> 23:40.868
Ah, we've slipped the
surly bonds of Earth.

23:40.870 --> 23:43.487
There goes the big, blue marble.

23:44.850 --> 23:45.763
What the what?

23:48.800 --> 23:50.553
There's a potted plant out there.

23:51.928 --> 23:52.761
What?

23:56.220 --> 23:58.928
Oh, there's a potted plant out there.

23:58.930 --> 24:00.288
Nope.

24:00.290 --> 24:02.998
You're hallucinating as usual.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.171
Why is he always trying to scare me?

24:05.173 --> 24:07.013
I will pop a cap in your wood ass.

24:19.632 --> 24:23.420
Whoa, it's the flamin', coitus.

24:24.290 --> 24:25.792
Don't even think about it, hickory nut.

24:25.794 --> 24:27.418
Oh!

24:27.420 --> 24:28.496
But, but.

24:37.101 --> 24:39.083
Boris, this is Natasha.

24:39.940 --> 24:42.263
I am activating my 3D holographic display.

24:43.190 --> 24:44.021
Come in.

24:44.023 --> 24:45.827
This is Boris coming in.

24:47.258 --> 24:48.938
Report, comrade.

24:48.940 --> 24:52.398
I have successfully
penetrated Americana airspace.

24:52.400 --> 24:55.224
No challenge, no resistance.

24:55.226 --> 24:57.243
It would be futile.

24:57.245 --> 24:58.076
Panama, come in.

24:58.078 --> 24:59.716
State your current location.

24:59.718 --> 25:02.973
Wait, comrade, I'm receiving
another transmission.

25:04.150 --> 25:05.350
I'll see what they want.

25:08.728 --> 25:09.871
Mm.

25:09.873 --> 25:11.103
Panama, come in.

25:12.320 --> 25:14.370
Please state your current location, over.

25:16.040 --> 25:16.920
Over the Cape.

25:19.058 --> 25:20.238
What do you see down there?

25:20.240 --> 25:21.073
Over.

25:23.523 --> 25:25.888
It's unbelievable.

25:25.890 --> 25:28.688
Cars abandoned in the road.

25:28.690 --> 25:30.361
There's no sign of life.

25:30.363 --> 25:31.608
Lights in the tower are on

25:31.610 --> 25:34.278
but I don't see anyone down there.

25:34.280 --> 25:37.222
Just a lotta plants.

25:37.224 --> 25:38.243
Over.

25:38.245 --> 25:39.227
Plants?

25:39.229 --> 25:41.037
- Over.
- Yeah, Roger, plants.

25:45.670 --> 25:48.708
Please return to base, over.

25:48.710 --> 25:50.208
Roger, Roger.

25:57.388 --> 26:01.148
Boris, the Americana's are
fleeing their homeland.

26:01.150 --> 26:04.128
They must have received word
of our impending invasion.

26:04.130 --> 26:06.718
Excellent news, Natasha.

26:06.720 --> 26:08.637
I'll inform Placidium.

26:08.639 --> 26:11.696
You will receive order of
landing for your bravery.

26:11.698 --> 26:12.947
Returning to base.

26:16.150 --> 26:17.811
Good evening and welcome

26:17.813 --> 26:20.878
to another edition of "One on One."

26:20.880 --> 26:23.637
I'm your host, Laura Luzair.

26:23.639 --> 26:27.878
Tonight, we have with us Dr.
Samantha Stamen, Head Botanist

26:27.880 --> 26:31.157
at the U.S. Department of
Agriculture in Washington, D.C.

26:32.550 --> 26:35.968
Dr. Stamen, thank you for joining us.

26:35.970 --> 26:37.548
The pleasure is all yours.

26:37.550 --> 26:39.248
Indeed!

26:39.250 --> 26:43.308
So, how did you become a head botanist?

26:43.310 --> 26:46.148
I wasn't aware that plants had heads.

26:46.150 --> 26:47.499
I wasn't aware that you didn't.

26:48.340 --> 26:49.838
As to my chosen profession,

26:49.840 --> 26:52.288
I guess I was destined to be a botanist

26:52.290 --> 26:54.488
since my family name is synonymous

26:54.490 --> 26:57.168
with the plants' reproductive sack.

26:57.170 --> 26:59.918
I got a lot of taunting at school,

26:59.920 --> 27:01.758
- but I'm sure
- Aw!

27:01.760 --> 27:03.648
you can relate to that, Luzair.

27:03.650 --> 27:05.318
Of course!

27:05.320 --> 27:09.778
Tonight, we are facing the
greatest threat to humanity.

27:09.780 --> 27:13.028
I am talking about the household plant.

27:13.030 --> 27:16.611
We invite them into our homes
because they look innocent

27:16.613 --> 27:18.298
and they don't give us any crap,

27:18.300 --> 27:21.758
but my research shows that they are

27:21.760 --> 27:25.408
the first wave of a massive
invasion force headed

27:25.410 --> 27:28.848
for this planet at this very moment.

27:28.850 --> 27:32.018
Let me demonstrate a
quick and effective way

27:32.020 --> 27:34.963
to rid yourselves of these
treacherous creatures.

27:36.890 --> 27:40.618
Put the noose around the
stem and pull it taught

27:40.620 --> 27:43.363
so the plant can't escape and then,

27:45.360 --> 27:49.108
push it off the closest
ledge or window sill.

27:49.110 --> 27:50.173
Oh, dear God!

27:51.010 --> 27:53.028
Why didn't you warn us?

27:53.030 --> 27:55.268
Ladies and gentlemen,
if it's not too late,

27:55.270 --> 27:57.978
please send your children
into another room.

27:57.980 --> 27:59.611
You fools!

27:59.613 --> 28:01.640
You're in danger!

28:01.642 --> 28:02.909
Don't you see it?

28:02.911 --> 28:04.678
They're after you!

28:04.680 --> 28:06.338
They're after all of us.

28:06.340 --> 28:08.918
Your wives, your children.

28:08.920 --> 28:10.948
Oh, they're already here!

28:10.950 --> 28:11.918
Oh!

28:11.920 --> 28:13.597
You're next!

28:13.599 --> 28:14.599
You're next!

28:17.823 --> 28:19.293
I don't see anyone.

28:21.600 --> 28:25.243
Just these plants, everywhere.

28:27.580 --> 28:29.513
Where did all the people go?

28:30.580 --> 28:34.123
It's like they're still here but aren't.

28:35.240 --> 28:38.193
What's with all these weird spores?

28:39.180 --> 28:41.969
I don't know, but they better
not clog up our air supply.

28:41.971 --> 28:43.457
Hey, you guys?

28:48.979 --> 28:50.963
What the hell is this?

28:52.190 --> 28:54.853
I don't know, one of
them damn vegans from LA?

29:00.090 --> 29:03.263
It says right here his
name is Benjamin Ficus.

29:04.610 --> 29:07.060
Hey, there's plants in
all the other cars, too.

29:08.513 --> 29:09.344
Call headquarters.

29:09.346 --> 29:13.068
This whole town's turning
into a giant nursery.

29:13.070 --> 29:16.173
Say, are you feelin' all right?

29:17.670 --> 29:18.768
You look kinda tired.

29:18.770 --> 29:19.910
You gettin' enough sleep?

29:21.000 --> 29:22.409
Get your eyes checked.

29:22.411 --> 29:23.242
You're the one looking

29:23.244 --> 29:24.488
like roadkill.

29:24.490 --> 29:26.148
Well, if you ask me both

29:26.150 --> 29:28.388
of you should find the
nearest funeral home.

29:28.390 --> 29:31.288
Yeah, well nobody's askin'
you Miss Recedin' Hairline.

29:31.290 --> 29:32.121
Oh, really?

29:32.123 --> 29:33.918
Look who's talking, Miss It Took Me

29:33.920 --> 29:36.168
a Week to Cover my Bald Spot!

29:36.170 --> 29:38.888
What you two need is
a good plastic surgeon.

29:38.890 --> 29:41.354
Your faces are hanging
down below your ankles.

29:41.356 --> 29:42.628
- What?
- Hey, come to think of it,

29:42.630 --> 29:44.728
you're startin' to look like her.

29:44.730 --> 29:46.528
That's funny, I was thinkin'

29:46.530 --> 29:48.804
the same thing about you two losers.

29:48.806 --> 29:50.966
- Oh, my God!
- Oh!

29:51.904 --> 29:53.620
We're starting to mutate!

29:53.622 --> 29:57.721
No, no, no, no, I can't
look as hideous as you!

29:57.723 --> 30:00.218
I can't tell if that's
your face or your ass!

30:00.220 --> 30:01.218
Oh my God!

30:01.220 --> 30:05.263
What a way to go.

30:07.118 --> 30:10.335
What the hell
is happening to us?

30:10.337 --> 30:11.420
Let me see!

30:13.724 --> 30:16.701
I look like the Crypt
Keeper's father!

30:16.703 --> 30:17.610
Come here!

30:17.612 --> 30:19.674
Get back here!

30:19.676 --> 30:21.891
Shut your hole!

30:21.893 --> 30:25.968
Holy Botox, my husband'll
never lay me again.

30:25.970 --> 30:27.385
He'll never lay me again either.

30:27.387 --> 30:30.678
You're the one
who's been screwin' him?

30:30.680 --> 30:32.118
Oops, sorry.

30:32.120 --> 30:33.064
What are friends for?

30:33.066 --> 30:34.187
I oughta!

30:34.189 --> 30:37.588
Yeah, well, better you than her.

30:37.590 --> 30:39.123
Guess it's time to confess.

30:40.670 --> 30:41.503
Uh oh.

30:42.527 --> 30:45.064
You cheap little tartelette!

30:45.066 --> 30:47.543
- You whore of Babylon!
- Don't fight, don't fight!

30:47.545 --> 30:48.805
No, no, no, no!

30:48.807 --> 30:49.695
Don't fight!

30:52.666 --> 30:54.217
- Don't fight, don't fight!
- Watch my hair.

30:54.219 --> 30:56.567
My hair, my hair!

30:59.850 --> 31:02.068
Miss Hastings, I have the latest report

31:02.070 --> 31:03.577
from the National Guard.

31:03.579 --> 31:05.828
Read it to me, Douchewood.

31:05.830 --> 31:06.663
Okay.

31:08.607 --> 31:11.995
"Blackout has spread
throughout the county,

31:11.997 --> 31:13.235
"including the Cape.

31:13.237 --> 31:17.798
"No apparent reason or
explanation yet discovered."

31:17.800 --> 31:18.828
Wait.

31:18.830 --> 31:20.018
Oh my God.

31:20.020 --> 31:21.238
What is that?

31:21.240 --> 31:22.738
It's moving right for us.

31:22.740 --> 31:23.571
Terry, don't!

31:23.573 --> 31:25.292
Oh, come on, man.

31:25.294 --> 31:26.505
I just wanna touch it.

31:28.196 --> 31:31.638
Oh, no, Terry, open fire.

31:31.640 --> 31:33.078
Joe, open fire!

31:35.180 --> 31:37.349
Shoot that green son of a bitch.

31:39.980 --> 31:40.918
Wait!

31:40.920 --> 31:42.418
How the hell did it get behind me?

31:42.420 --> 31:43.698
Get it off my face!

31:43.700 --> 31:44.768
- I can't breathe.
- Oh!

31:44.770 --> 31:45.601
I can't breathe.

31:45.603 --> 31:48.163
I can't, I can't, it's changing me!

32:02.151 --> 32:03.398
I'm afraid that's it.

32:03.400 --> 32:06.418
Well, you better call the President.

32:06.420 --> 32:08.378
This is a national emergency

32:08.380 --> 32:13.287
and all action taken should
be thorough and...

32:17.652 --> 32:20.485
Shut your hole!

32:21.991 --> 32:24.201
Immediate.

32:28.755 --> 32:33.088
Assure him that I'm staying
on top of the situation.

32:34.398 --> 32:37.404
Busy, busy, busy, busy again.

32:37.406 --> 32:39.638
I'm the President of the United States.

32:39.640 --> 32:42.018
You'd think I could at least
get ahold of my bookie.

32:42.020 --> 32:44.618
All our communications are being jammed.

32:44.620 --> 32:48.333
Every cell tower in America is
being overwhelmed with vines.

32:49.840 --> 32:53.091
Secretary Downe, you
send the Army over there

32:53.093 --> 32:55.228
with some great big weed
whackers, all right?

32:55.230 --> 32:59.858
I want those towers cleared
and those damn vines whacked.

32:59.860 --> 33:01.388
I wish we could, Sir.

33:01.390 --> 33:04.613
Here are these, the latest
satellite surveillance photos.

33:06.700 --> 33:07.800
Sweet Mother of God.

33:11.024 --> 33:14.318
There are vines everywhere.

33:14.320 --> 33:17.578
What am I gonna say to millions
and millions of people?

33:17.580 --> 33:19.438
They're all gonna lose their leaves.

33:19.440 --> 33:21.481
Mr. President, I've
got A.S.S. on the phone.

33:21.483 --> 33:23.007
You got what?

33:23.009 --> 33:25.168
I've got A.S.S. on the phone.

33:25.170 --> 33:26.628
Ass?

33:26.630 --> 33:28.808
You got a ass on the phone?

33:28.810 --> 33:31.528
Well, then spray somethin'
on the damn thing.

33:31.530 --> 33:32.361
Put some disinfectant on it

33:32.363 --> 33:34.228
if you're gonna put that thing in my face.

33:34.230 --> 33:35.843
- No sir, no.
- Clean your own ass

33:35.845 --> 33:37.198
- Sir, Sir...
- for Christ sakes.

33:37.200 --> 33:38.031
No, no, no.

33:38.033 --> 33:38.864
- No, Sir.
- What the hell are you doin'?

33:38.866 --> 33:40.278
- What are you thinkin'?
- It's the Space Agency.

33:40.280 --> 33:42.511
Some private named Doodywood is calling.

33:42.513 --> 33:44.328
Doodywood and an ass phone.

33:44.330 --> 33:46.528
What the hell is this country coming to?

33:46.530 --> 33:47.780
Put him on speaker phone.

33:50.100 --> 33:51.478
Go ahead, Doodywood.

33:51.480 --> 33:55.638
This is National Security
Advisor, Russell Sprout.

33:55.640 --> 33:58.508
- I'm here with President Dover,
- Yeah.

33:58.510 --> 34:00.853
and Defense Secretary Downe.

34:02.290 --> 34:03.373
What's goin' on?

34:04.490 --> 34:06.148
Doodyhead, you're on the phone

34:06.150 --> 34:07.898
with Neil Downe and Ben Dover.

34:07.900 --> 34:09.242
Will you respond, Sir?

34:12.090 --> 34:14.208
Say
somethin' you idiot.

34:14.210 --> 34:17.487
I'm sorry, Sir, I'm afraid
we're cut off from the world.

34:17.489 --> 34:19.858
All right, that's enough.

34:19.860 --> 34:22.558
Now it's time to nuke
these green goblin bastards

34:22.560 --> 34:24.428
right down to their stem cells.

34:24.429 --> 34:25.368
Right?

34:25.370 --> 34:28.638
Total, complete, absolute deforestation.

34:28.639 --> 34:29.598
You understand?

34:29.600 --> 34:31.408
Mr. President, right now,

34:31.409 --> 34:33.745
I couldn't order us a pizza.

34:33.746 --> 34:35.614
Well, who the hell's gonna eat a pizza?

34:35.616 --> 34:38.023
Unless you cook it at 9,000 degrees.

34:38.860 --> 34:42.098
I want nuclear ash up
to the windows in here.

34:42.100 --> 34:43.348
I'm gonna take 'em out.

34:43.350 --> 34:44.688
I'm gonna take 'em down.

34:44.690 --> 34:46.438
It's over for them vines and that's it

34:46.440 --> 34:48.808
or my name ain't Ben Dover.

34:48.810 --> 34:51.078
We'll be at your command
bunker in a minute.

34:51.080 --> 34:53.038
You can run the attack from there.

34:53.040 --> 34:54.360
If we make it alive because

34:54.362 --> 34:55.992
this idiot's all over the road.

34:58.595 --> 34:59.845
Hang on, honey!

35:00.707 --> 35:03.091
You got to get a new wardrobe my dear.

35:03.093 --> 35:05.321
I can't feel my legs!

35:05.323 --> 35:06.154
Where is the slide?

35:06.156 --> 35:07.799
Get me outta here!

35:07.801 --> 35:09.767
- Mr. President, help!
- Come on!

35:13.247 --> 35:14.484
Give me my hand.

35:14.486 --> 35:16.762
- Sir!
- Go ahead, kill him!

35:16.764 --> 35:17.903
Let go of my pants!

35:22.853 --> 35:24.338
This way, Mr. President.

35:24.340 --> 35:26.078
I'm gon' shield you with my Afro.

35:26.080 --> 35:27.507
- Shoot, let's go.
- Well, thank you.

35:27.509 --> 35:28.340
Let's go.

35:28.342 --> 35:29.803
Get the hell outta here.

35:31.020 --> 35:31.948
Come on, Eileen.

35:31.950 --> 35:34.152
Okay, Dad, don't burst a valve.

35:40.773 --> 35:42.258
- Mr. President?
- Yeah?

35:42.260 --> 35:44.058
Your wife will be
joining you any minute.

35:44.060 --> 35:45.534
Oh, thanks for reminding me.

35:48.320 --> 35:49.151
Oh no.

35:49.153 --> 35:50.038
Oh, there, there.

35:50.040 --> 35:52.248
Sweetheart, I'm sure
your mom's gonna be okay.

35:52.250 --> 35:54.138
I've got no bars.

35:54.140 --> 35:56.098
Wait, what are we doing
in this creepy place?

35:56.100 --> 35:58.218
Honey, this is the presidential bunker.

35:58.220 --> 35:59.051
All right?

35:59.053 --> 35:59.884
You'll be safe here.

35:59.886 --> 36:01.198
I don't wanna be safe.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.528
I wanna go to the mall.

36:03.530 --> 36:04.638
Mr. President?

36:04.640 --> 36:06.168
Yeah?

36:06.170 --> 36:10.087
We have a situation.

36:12.343 --> 36:14.783
Listen, your name is Sprout, right?

36:15.960 --> 36:19.433
So why don't ya like talk plant to them?

36:26.600 --> 36:30.893
We come in peace.

36:37.200 --> 36:41.670
We mean you no harm.

36:48.115 --> 36:50.618
You know, it ain't workin' so,

36:50.620 --> 36:53.018
this blows my reelection
completely to hell.

36:53.020 --> 36:55.920
I'm just gonna go over there
and shoot myself in the face.

37:00.170 --> 37:02.438
Well, gang, I think it's a good time

37:02.440 --> 37:03.978
to talk about ourselves.

37:03.980 --> 37:06.538
That way we'll get to
know each other better.

37:06.540 --> 37:07.518
Why?

37:07.520 --> 37:09.558
The audience has to bond with us.

37:09.560 --> 37:13.813
Otherwise we're nothing more
than cardboard characters.

37:17.200 --> 37:18.033
I'll start.

37:18.980 --> 37:21.708
I am an Aires with a Taurus rising

37:21.710 --> 37:23.878
and my Moon in Libra.

37:23.880 --> 37:26.128
I was an Eager Beaver
Scout at the age of 10,

37:26.130 --> 37:30.768
then graduated three years later
with a PhD in astrophysics.

37:30.770 --> 37:32.437
Now, although I'm married,

37:32.439 --> 37:36.458
I've never been sexually
aroused by my wife.

37:36.460 --> 37:38.968
I'm intelligent, resourceful,

37:38.970 --> 37:42.698
loyal, honest, and squeaky clean.

37:42.700 --> 37:47.700
I'm also highly naive and
possess a nonexistent libido.

37:47.740 --> 37:51.383
My main goal in life is to live forever.

37:52.250 --> 37:54.258
Okay, your turn.

37:54.260 --> 37:57.218
I was born and raised
in the sewers of New York.

37:57.220 --> 38:00.748
I found out pretty quickly
that I needed an education,

38:00.750 --> 38:03.238
so I knocked over a bank and entered one

38:03.240 --> 38:05.626
of those ritzy finishing schools.

38:05.628 --> 38:08.913
Then, I was ready for the world.

38:10.057 --> 38:11.655
I started making phone calls.

38:11.657 --> 38:16.309
I got ahold of some big shot
who worked at the agency.

38:16.311 --> 38:18.038
I told him about my qualifications

38:18.040 --> 38:21.023
to be an astronaut and he hired me.

38:22.160 --> 38:24.338
How about you guys?

38:24.340 --> 38:28.882
I don't know where,
when or why I was born.

38:28.884 --> 38:31.973
A pack of wolves found
me at Yellowstone Park.

38:32.910 --> 38:35.819
I lived with them for 23
years before I bailed.

38:35.821 --> 38:39.413
It taught me all about
nature and the wilderness.

38:40.574 --> 38:43.378
I still sleep
on a bed of leaves.

38:43.380 --> 38:45.861
My best friends are plants and animals.

38:48.530 --> 38:51.788
I'm sensitive, shy, loving,

38:51.790 --> 38:54.253
and have hidden wells of creative talent.

38:55.470 --> 38:58.633
I crave orange juice and nudity.

39:01.050 --> 39:05.728
My secret desire is to
spread mustard on my...

39:05.730 --> 39:07.268
Thanks, Charlie.

39:07.270 --> 39:09.798
Okay, Doc, what's your story?

39:09.800 --> 39:12.200
Well, I come from a
large Chinese farm family.

39:13.230 --> 39:14.478
When I got tired of picking rice,

39:14.480 --> 39:16.556
I hopped a banana boat to Houston.

39:16.558 --> 39:18.853
I inherited psychic abilities from Buddha.

39:20.116 --> 39:21.978
A few years ago, I found my medical degree

39:21.980 --> 39:23.513
in a Cracker Jack box.

39:24.760 --> 39:26.244
Pretty easy bein' a doctor.

39:26.246 --> 39:28.796
All you have to do is double
talk to sick bastards.

39:30.650 --> 39:34.632
I'm pretty materialistic and
I have a pretty short temper,

39:34.634 --> 39:36.578
and I've killed or maimed dozens

39:36.580 --> 39:38.213
with my stunning incompetence.

39:39.500 --> 39:42.348
Don't you guys feel the love?

39:42.350 --> 39:44.908
Well, now people will
actually care about us.

39:44.910 --> 39:46.088
Wanna bet?

39:46.090 --> 39:48.183
Let's float back to our bunks.

39:53.000 --> 39:56.928
Ah, the feeling of weightlessness.

39:56.930 --> 39:58.430
Isn't this awesome?

39:59.290 --> 40:00.876
Words don't do it justice.

40:03.564 --> 40:04.395
Whoa!

40:04.397 --> 40:07.203
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

40:13.391 --> 40:16.038
Connie, read me a story.

40:16.040 --> 40:17.572
Not tonight, Kirk.

40:17.574 --> 40:18.628
I've got a headache.

40:18.630 --> 40:20.858
Oh, come on, Charlie, be a pal.

40:20.860 --> 40:23.508
We're going 10,000 miles an hour.

40:23.510 --> 40:24.898
I'll get space sick.

40:24.900 --> 40:25.731
Bob?

40:25.733 --> 40:26.564
Don't even ask.

40:26.566 --> 40:27.398
Oh.

40:27.400 --> 40:29.348
Well, then I'll read it to you.

40:29.350 --> 40:32.203
It's one of my best stories.

40:32.205 --> 40:35.298
Wait, you're gonna read
us something you wrote?

40:35.300 --> 40:38.685
Of course, I can't get enough of myself.

40:38.687 --> 40:40.535
"Goodnight, Earth.

40:40.537 --> 40:43.005
"Goodnight, joy and mirth.

40:43.007 --> 40:46.578
"Goodnight to my belt
and ever expanding girth.

40:47.717 --> 40:48.875
"Goodnight, Earth.

40:48.877 --> 40:51.233
"Goodnight to those lights in Perth.

40:51.235 --> 40:55.574
"Goodnight to my agents and
my outstanding networth."

40:56.409 --> 40:57.448
That's enough of that noise.

40:57.450 --> 40:59.178
Huh?

40:59.180 --> 41:01.283
Hey, we all need some rest.

41:02.160 --> 41:03.288
Okay, then.

41:03.290 --> 41:04.538
Goodnight, Connie.

41:04.540 --> 41:05.528
Goodnight, Kirk.

41:05.530 --> 41:06.361
Goodnight, Charlie.

41:06.363 --> 41:08.058
- Goodnight, Kirk.
- Goodnight, Charlie.

41:08.060 --> 41:08.891
Goodnight, Connie.

41:08.893 --> 41:09.730
Goodnight, Bob.

41:09.732 --> 41:10.563
Goodnight, Connie.

41:10.565 --> 41:11.488
Goodnight, Bob.

41:11.490 --> 41:12.321
Yeah, yeah, okay, goodnight.

41:12.323 --> 41:13.448
Goodnight, Bobby Boy.

41:13.450 --> 41:14.670
And don't call me boy.

41:16.400 --> 41:17.231
I'm Chinese.

41:17.233 --> 41:18.064
What?

41:18.066 --> 41:19.348
You're Chinese?

41:19.350 --> 41:21.833
Where's the shuttle now?

41:23.360 --> 41:24.193
Oh my God.

41:25.310 --> 41:27.658
It's three minutes from lunar impact.

41:27.660 --> 41:28.798
Better wake 'em up.

41:28.800 --> 41:30.258
Yes, my mistress.

41:30.260 --> 41:32.193
Slither off, slave.

41:44.010 --> 41:45.873
Do you approve, Sensei?

41:47.120 --> 41:51.336
I find your need for approval annoying.

41:53.839 --> 41:57.843
Never attempt to curve my favor

41:57.845 --> 42:00.413
with such a shameful display.

42:02.270 --> 42:04.208
You have much to learn.

42:04.210 --> 42:06.548
Oh, thank you, Sensei.

42:06.550 --> 42:08.458
I shall try harder.

42:08.460 --> 42:09.293
Do.

42:10.558 --> 42:11.936
There is no try.

42:26.641 --> 42:29.568
Houston, this is Lunar Shuttle Five.

42:29.570 --> 42:33.208
We've made a successful landing
and everything's just swell.

42:33.210 --> 42:34.328
Oh, hold on.

42:34.330 --> 42:36.921
I hereby promise the
people of Earth one thing,

42:36.923 --> 42:39.168
that we won't contact you again

42:39.170 --> 42:41.986
until we've solved this vexing enigma.

42:43.239 --> 42:44.287
We're sorry,

42:44.289 --> 42:46.367
you have reached a number
that has been disconnected

42:46.369 --> 42:48.197
or is no longer in service.

42:56.340 --> 42:58.848
Hey, shouldn't we be wearing suits?

42:58.850 --> 43:00.843
This isn't a formal occasion.

43:05.045 --> 43:07.371
I sure hope my friend
Jack's okay in there.

43:07.373 --> 43:09.225
What about your wife?

43:09.227 --> 43:11.173
Her too.

43:12.490 --> 43:13.968
Who is it?

43:13.970 --> 43:17.863
It's Kirk and Connie
and Bob and Charlie.

43:22.410 --> 43:23.708
Hey.

43:23.710 --> 43:24.614
Look who's here.

43:24.616 --> 43:27.818
Hi.

43:27.820 --> 43:28.920
How are you, Connie?

43:43.280 --> 43:44.780
Good to see you, too.

43:45.810 --> 43:46.810
Kirk, how are you?

43:48.220 --> 43:49.743
Have you lost your mind?

43:50.810 --> 43:51.641
Come on in.

43:55.920 --> 43:57.893
Hello, Cheryl.

43:58.870 --> 43:59.960
Did you miss me?

44:02.300 --> 44:03.773
Are you happy to see me?

44:06.192 --> 44:07.542
Are you having a good time?

44:09.520 --> 44:11.313
Are you happy to be going home?

44:14.930 --> 44:16.330
Good talking to you, Cheryl.

44:17.190 --> 44:20.133
Connie, how long are you staying?

44:21.240 --> 44:23.019
- As long as...
- As long as necessary.

44:23.021 --> 44:25.491
I think Jack was talking to me.

44:29.040 --> 44:33.468
Bob, I want you to give these
two a through examination.

44:33.470 --> 44:35.448
You need my report as soon as possible.

44:35.450 --> 44:37.628
I need your
report as soon as possible.

44:37.630 --> 44:38.612
So do I.

44:38.614 --> 44:39.674
Come with me.

44:46.050 --> 44:46.923
What happened?

44:48.490 --> 44:49.321
What gives?

44:49.323 --> 44:51.793
What is it, what, what's going on?

44:52.990 --> 44:54.988
What happened to my Jack?

44:54.990 --> 44:56.760
What indeed?

44:56.762 --> 45:00.158
I bet he's been brainwashed
by that slutty ho of yours.

45:00.160 --> 45:01.918
No, I think it's something

45:01.920 --> 45:04.858
more than that slutty ho of mine.

45:04.860 --> 45:05.694
Let's look around.

45:07.400 --> 45:08.233
Wow.

45:09.350 --> 45:10.183
Odd.

45:12.900 --> 45:16.203
Trail of dirt seems to
lead to this drawer.

45:20.458 --> 45:21.291
Hm.

45:26.079 --> 45:26.996
Plant food.

45:28.493 --> 45:29.324
Hm.

45:29.326 --> 45:31.229
Interesting plot development.

45:32.540 --> 45:34.428
♪ Freaky, freaky boys ♪

45:34.430 --> 45:35.498
♪ Sexy, sexy boys ♪

45:35.500 --> 45:37.400
What's the verdict, Doc?

45:37.402 --> 45:38.978
Well, they seem strong enough.

45:38.980 --> 45:41.048
I'll have my final report later.

45:41.050 --> 45:42.958
Kirk, you have to go downstairs

45:42.960 --> 45:44.831
and get our computerized
flight plan ready.

45:44.833 --> 45:47.008
- All right, then...
- all right, we can,

45:47.010 --> 45:50.139
this time he's talking to me.

45:50.141 --> 45:50.974
Hm.

45:52.351 --> 45:55.358
I mean, we can go
right now if you'd like.

45:55.360 --> 45:56.212
Great.

46:00.640 --> 46:02.758
They want outta here bad.

46:02.760 --> 46:06.328
Are you havin' a
psychic impression, Bob?

46:06.330 --> 46:07.963
Yeah, you could call it that.

46:08.900 --> 46:10.700
I'll stay here and finish my report.

46:11.687 --> 46:13.888
Let's go after 'em.

46:13.890 --> 46:14.723
Oop!

46:30.683 --> 46:31.633
Is this a sauna?

46:33.040 --> 46:34.923
Nope, it's an elevator.

46:36.330 --> 46:38.818
It looks like a sauna.

46:38.820 --> 46:41.223
Trust me, it's an elevator.

46:44.150 --> 46:45.358
It's gettin' pretty hot in here.

46:45.360 --> 46:46.258
It's an elevator, okay?

46:46.260 --> 46:48.243
Okay, okay, it's an elevator.

46:49.910 --> 46:52.340
Now what's downstairs, Charlie?

46:52.342 --> 46:53.968
It's a top secret room where

46:53.970 --> 46:56.808
our most sophisticated computers are.

46:56.810 --> 46:58.769
Only a few people in
the world have access.

46:58.771 --> 46:59.602
Hm.

46:59.604 --> 47:01.498
Well, how do you keep
unauthorized personnel

47:01.500 --> 47:03.598
from just wandering it?

47:03.600 --> 47:06.628
Besides being 240,000 miles from Earth,

47:06.630 --> 47:09.678
and 100 feet below the lunar surface,

47:09.680 --> 47:13.018
there are five security
devices that we have to pass.

47:13.020 --> 47:15.018
Can you elucidate?

47:15.020 --> 47:18.284
I could, but who's gonna clean it up?

47:18.286 --> 47:19.148
Hm.

47:19.150 --> 47:20.676
Well, not me.

47:25.520 --> 47:27.120
Sinus analyzer.

47:28.870 --> 47:31.316
Cover nose and breathe deeply.

47:33.507 --> 47:35.218
Oh, breathalyzer, all right.

47:35.220 --> 47:36.418
Whoa!

47:36.420 --> 47:38.419
Sinus analysis complete.

47:39.360 --> 47:40.260
You may proceed.

47:41.095 --> 47:42.258
What's this room?

47:42.260 --> 47:44.088
Footprint analyzer.

47:44.090 --> 47:45.683
Place feet on sensor.

47:47.060 --> 47:48.688
Footprint analysis complete.

47:48.690 --> 47:50.463
You may proceed.

47:54.970 --> 47:56.848
Bite analyzer.

47:56.850 --> 47:57.973
What?

48:00.890 --> 48:02.740
Bite down on sponge.

48:05.860 --> 48:06.691
Really?

48:06.693 --> 48:08.487
Bite down on sponge.

48:11.120 --> 48:12.978
Bite down on sponge, damn it!

48:12.980 --> 48:14.612
All right.

48:14.614 --> 48:17.351
Bite analysis complete,

48:18.186 --> 48:20.028
at last.

48:20.030 --> 48:20.861
You may proceed.

48:21.696 --> 48:23.198
What the hell is this?

48:23.200 --> 48:25.618
Belly button analyzer.

48:25.620 --> 48:28.278
Place plunger over belly button.

48:28.280 --> 48:30.206
Belly button analysis complete.

48:31.048 --> 48:32.008
Stupid.

48:32.010 --> 48:33.097
You may proceed.

48:36.520 --> 48:37.998
Is this the last of it?

48:38.000 --> 48:39.388
Yes.

48:39.390 --> 48:40.783
What's this one do?

48:44.867 --> 48:46.703
Anal analyzer?

49:02.770 --> 49:03.601
Oi!

49:12.050 --> 49:14.350
We're gonna get that
computerized print out.

49:15.630 --> 49:17.130
I don't think I can make it.

49:19.375 --> 49:21.878
Well, that's strange.

49:21.880 --> 49:23.728
What do you mean?

49:23.730 --> 49:27.048
We just got TSA'd big time.

49:27.050 --> 49:28.858
How are they able to move?

49:28.860 --> 49:30.538
Good question.

49:30.540 --> 49:32.908
We need to talk but not here.

49:32.910 --> 49:34.978
Jack and Cheryl might hear us.

49:34.980 --> 49:36.283
No we won't.

49:37.320 --> 49:39.848
There's a conference room on level two.

49:39.850 --> 49:41.088
We can talk there.

49:41.090 --> 49:42.278
Great.

49:42.280 --> 49:44.130
Let's see if we can stand.

49:45.800 --> 49:47.548
Oh, man.

49:47.550 --> 49:49.971
Anal analyzer, mother...

49:50.806 --> 49:52.071
Oh!

49:52.073 --> 49:54.598
Oo!

49:54.600 --> 49:56.800
Wow, man!

49:56.802 --> 49:58.451
Wowza!

49:58.453 --> 49:59.803
That yoga's really payin' off.

50:01.600 --> 50:03.513
Get out here now!

50:06.690 --> 50:08.033
Oo, whoa!

50:09.590 --> 50:12.708
White boy's packin' some
serious heat up in here.

50:12.710 --> 50:13.543
Yeah!

50:14.710 --> 50:16.318
It's not what you think.

50:16.320 --> 50:20.328
Oh, well you certainly
have come to the right girl.

50:20.330 --> 50:21.795
Let's take a little peek.

50:21.797 --> 50:23.309
Okay.

50:23.311 --> 50:25.538
Careful.

50:25.540 --> 50:30.540
Oh, what the Jolly Green Giant is this?

50:30.700 --> 50:34.219
Have you been rippin'
off the commissary again?

50:34.221 --> 50:35.054
It just grew.

50:36.030 --> 50:37.419
Grew?

50:37.421 --> 50:39.908
What else do you have down here?

50:39.910 --> 50:42.218
Two great big onions.

50:42.220 --> 50:45.148
Well, this is a real
mess ain't it, Farmer John?

50:45.150 --> 50:47.711
Didn't you attend any of my
personal hygiene courses?

50:48.546 --> 50:49.543
Oh no.

50:49.545 --> 50:51.724
I feel a tomato coming on.

50:51.726 --> 50:53.198
Oh, what do I do?

50:53.200 --> 50:55.950
Well, grow some lettuce or
I'm gonna toss me a salad.

50:58.625 --> 51:00.761
I'm so thirsty.

51:00.763 --> 51:01.842
Are you thirsty?

51:01.844 --> 51:03.165
I'm thirsty.

51:03.167 --> 51:04.143
I need water.

51:05.400 --> 51:07.535
Lots and lots of water.

51:07.537 --> 51:09.370
- Hey, water?
- Water.

51:10.596 --> 51:12.344
- Hey.
- What happened?

51:12.346 --> 51:13.179
No, no.

51:14.030 --> 51:16.297
I need to be watered, you got to water me.

51:17.433 --> 51:18.964
This won't be enough.

51:23.276 --> 51:24.263
Find another jug.

51:26.204 --> 51:28.408
It's too dark in here, huh?

51:28.410 --> 51:29.241
I need light.

51:29.243 --> 51:30.298
I need, no.

51:30.300 --> 51:31.195
Warm, wonderful light.

51:31.197 --> 51:33.168
No, no, no.

51:33.170 --> 51:34.328
I need light.

51:34.330 --> 51:35.908
Get to one side.

51:35.910 --> 51:36.818
I can't.

51:36.820 --> 51:38.166
My roots are stuck to the floor.

51:40.501 --> 51:42.676
I'm afraid it's too late.

51:42.678 --> 51:45.246
We're turning into plants.

51:47.204 --> 51:48.962
I guess this is the end.

51:48.964 --> 51:50.812
Goodbye, Durwood.

51:52.766 --> 51:54.434
You called me Durwood.

51:54.436 --> 51:55.936
I did, didn't I?

51:57.681 --> 51:58.868
Let's pollinate.

51:58.870 --> 52:00.348
I love you.

52:00.350 --> 52:01.865
I have always loved you.

52:01.867 --> 52:03.272
I'm gonna lick your fruit gub.

52:03.274 --> 52:06.628
I want us to have wild, botanic sex.

52:06.630 --> 52:08.968
I'm gonna squeeze your melon.

52:08.970 --> 52:10.518
Kneel down, Durwood.

52:10.520 --> 52:13.992
Kneel down and feast upon
the fruit of my loins.

52:13.994 --> 52:15.224
- Yeah!
- Tug on my banana, baby.

52:15.226 --> 52:16.515
I'll tug hard.

52:16.517 --> 52:17.778
Yeah!

52:17.780 --> 52:18.648
Yeah!

52:25.120 --> 52:26.393
Oh, good, you're here.

52:28.020 --> 52:31.283
Guys, we're on this end over here.

52:32.851 --> 52:33.792
Hey.

52:33.794 --> 52:35.068
Hey.

52:35.070 --> 52:35.901
Guys?

52:39.854 --> 52:41.433
Man, this table's big.

52:43.130 --> 52:43.963
Oo.

52:46.800 --> 52:49.978
Hey guys, what do you
say we change it up a bit

52:49.980 --> 52:52.398
and meet on the other end of the table?

52:52.400 --> 52:53.698
No, we're good here.

52:53.700 --> 52:55.188
We like it here.

52:55.190 --> 52:56.023
Oh.

52:57.540 --> 52:59.708
Oh, this table is so long.

52:59.710 --> 53:01.375
Oh, chest pains.

53:09.410 --> 53:14.410
Garrison, must have mouth-to-mouth.

53:17.460 --> 53:18.863
Oh, yeah.

53:21.830 --> 53:23.628
That's my medical report.

53:23.630 --> 53:24.751
I've gone over it and over it.

53:24.753 --> 53:26.196
Is this all you've got?

53:26.198 --> 53:27.608
So far.

53:27.610 --> 53:29.688
I didn't have time to give
'em the full treatment.

53:29.690 --> 53:31.168
What have you found?

53:31.170 --> 53:33.198
Well, they're in perfect shape.

53:33.200 --> 53:34.948
I've never seen two people more healthy.

53:34.950 --> 53:37.198
She hasn't said a
word since we got here,

53:37.200 --> 53:38.718
maybe she's hiding something.

53:38.720 --> 53:40.008
Yeah, she wasn't hiding much.

53:40.010 --> 53:43.158
You ever seen a woman
wear a bikini backwards?

53:43.160 --> 53:46.730
No, but I sure hope it's a trend.

53:46.732 --> 53:49.218
There's one thing we know for sure.

53:49.220 --> 53:50.628
Something happened to those two.

53:50.630 --> 53:52.878
Another psychic impression, Bob?

53:52.880 --> 53:54.158
You could call it that.

53:54.160 --> 53:56.148
They've certainly been acting strange.

53:56.150 --> 53:59.218
Jack thinks I'm Kirk and thinks Kirk's me.

53:59.220 --> 54:01.998
- Yes, I noticed that, too.
- Yeah.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.158
They haven't eaten any of
their food in two weeks.

54:04.160 --> 54:05.538
And we haven't heard from them

54:05.540 --> 54:06.642
in the past couple of weeks.

54:06.644 --> 54:09.068
So, the obvious answer is...

54:09.070 --> 54:10.888
They've been on a diet for two weeks

54:10.890 --> 54:12.238
and didn't wanna tell us.

54:12.240 --> 54:13.626
Now we're getting somewhere.

54:13.628 --> 54:14.955
The thing I don't understand is...

54:17.820 --> 54:19.603
That's a shuttle taking off.

54:22.605 --> 54:26.363
Well, at least they didn't
jack the nuclear reactor.

54:27.613 --> 54:28.958
Huh?

54:28.960 --> 54:29.926
Those fucking dicks!

54:33.650 --> 54:36.089
Intercom, activate hummingbird.

54:40.079 --> 54:42.768
Connie, Charlie, Bob, get back down here.

54:42.770 --> 54:45.278
The nuclear reactor's
going super critical.

54:45.280 --> 54:46.328
And it's about to explode!

54:46.330 --> 54:49.608
This will cause a large scale destruction.

54:49.610 --> 54:50.693
Hey, wait up.

54:53.108 --> 54:54.666
Look at the door!

54:54.668 --> 54:55.946
It's fused shut.

54:55.948 --> 54:57.961
Is there another way in?

54:57.963 --> 54:59.868
Connie, go get a laser gun.

54:59.870 --> 55:01.698
Maybe we can blast our way through.

55:01.700 --> 55:02.531
Right.

55:02.533 --> 55:04.208
Bob, go call Houston.

55:04.210 --> 55:07.348
Tell them of our situation
and of Jack and Cheryl.

55:07.350 --> 55:08.183
Sure thing.

55:09.240 --> 55:10.898
Wait, I almost forgot.

55:10.900 --> 55:13.310
Can we attain ingress
through another passage?

55:13.312 --> 55:15.493
No, but there's another way in.

55:17.580 --> 55:18.788
Having that piece of chalk

55:18.790 --> 55:21.988
was certainly fortuitous, Charlie.

55:21.990 --> 55:23.328
Lucky, too.

55:23.330 --> 55:25.190
Now, okay, here we have the kitchen

55:25.192 --> 55:27.619
and over here are the bathrooms,

55:27.621 --> 55:30.828
and this is the master bedroom.

55:30.830 --> 55:32.833
Yes, but where is the reactor room?

55:35.480 --> 55:36.311
Sorry.

55:36.313 --> 55:37.146
Wrong complex.

55:38.180 --> 55:39.518
Hurry Charlie, we don't have much time.

55:39.520 --> 55:42.025
Okay, now this is the reactor room.

55:42.027 --> 55:45.858
There's an access tube
that leads in here but...

55:45.860 --> 55:46.743
But?

55:47.620 --> 55:50.808
It's connected to the
third floor computer complex.

55:50.810 --> 55:52.968
You mean, I've got to go through

55:52.970 --> 55:56.558
all those security devices again?

55:56.560 --> 55:57.805
I'll keep in touch with you by intercom.

55:57.807 --> 55:59.198
Sounds swell.

55:59.200 --> 56:00.031
Wish me luck.

56:00.033 --> 56:01.658
Good luck, Kirk.

56:01.660 --> 56:02.910
We're all counting on ya.

56:03.880 --> 56:04.718
All right.

56:06.661 --> 56:07.768
Sinus analyzer.

56:07.770 --> 56:09.028
- Whoa!
- Cover nose

56:09.030 --> 56:10.480
- Guys!
- and breath deeply.

56:11.930 --> 56:13.523
Sinus analysis complete.

56:14.390 --> 56:15.868
You may proceed.

56:15.870 --> 56:19.817
Must hurry, must hurry,
must hurry.

56:22.830 --> 56:23.663
Stand back!

56:27.760 --> 56:28.675
Nothing's happening.

56:28.677 --> 56:30.388
I know.

56:30.390 --> 56:32.248
I'll increase to full power.

56:32.250 --> 56:33.081
Isn't that a little risky?

56:33.083 --> 56:35.358
Maybe but we've gotta get in there.

56:35.360 --> 56:36.558
Where's Kirk?

56:36.560 --> 56:37.393
I'll check.

56:40.880 --> 56:42.182
Footprint analyzer.

56:48.490 --> 56:50.578
place feet on sensor.

56:50.580 --> 56:51.848
They're on!

56:51.850 --> 56:53.373
Footprint analysis complete.

56:55.385 --> 56:56.390
You may proceed.

57:01.460 --> 57:03.238
Bite analyzer.

57:03.240 --> 57:04.313
Bite down on sponge.

57:06.630 --> 57:08.888
Bite down on sponge!

57:08.890 --> 57:11.399
Bite down on sponge you little wuss.

57:12.400 --> 57:13.529
Ow, come here!

57:18.173 --> 57:19.449
Mm.

57:19.451 --> 57:21.738
Bite analyzer complete.

57:21.740 --> 57:23.038
You may proceed.

57:27.980 --> 57:30.368
It's wet t-shirt time, Ramora,

57:30.370 --> 57:31.878
and you're gonna get it.

57:31.880 --> 57:35.151
Dr. Deystrum, you don't
have a long enough hose.

57:35.153 --> 57:36.600
Well, we'll see...

57:38.680 --> 57:40.193
Belly button analyzer.

57:41.540 --> 57:44.358
Place plunger over belly button.

57:44.360 --> 57:45.658
I did, I did.

57:45.660 --> 57:47.318
Belly
button analysis complete.

57:47.320 --> 57:48.970
You may proceed.

57:49.805 --> 57:50.638
Ouch!

57:58.279 --> 57:59.883
Anal analyzer.

58:01.080 --> 58:01.938
Oh, God.

58:01.940 --> 58:02.813
I forgot the KY!

58:17.700 --> 58:18.708
Kirk?

58:18.710 --> 58:20.048
There's only seconds left.

58:20.050 --> 58:21.628
Ahead of you is the tube hatch.

58:21.630 --> 58:23.567
Enter one, two, three
on the security keypad

58:23.569 --> 58:25.278
and the hatch will open.

58:25.280 --> 58:28.078
Climb into the tube and
you'll be in the reactor room.

58:28.080 --> 58:29.375
Can you do it?

58:29.377 --> 58:32.671
I think I can.

58:32.673 --> 58:33.840
I think I can.

58:35.377 --> 58:39.000
I think I can.

58:41.590 --> 58:43.208
Oh, no.

58:43.210 --> 58:44.238
Oh, please.

58:44.240 --> 58:47.308
Please little gerbil, don't fail us now.

58:47.310 --> 58:49.265
Not in our most desperate hour.

58:49.267 --> 58:52.266
We beseech you to keep
the wheels spinning.

58:52.268 --> 58:55.728
Although we are only
human and you are not,

58:55.730 --> 58:57.408
- So what?
- please grant

58:57.410 --> 58:59.918
us deliverance from the dark.

58:59.920 --> 59:00.753
Amen.

59:02.654 --> 59:04.355
Okay.

59:15.220 --> 59:17.153
I'll remember you, always.

59:18.786 --> 59:19.805
Hm.

59:23.290 --> 59:24.347
Whoa!

59:26.984 --> 59:28.419
Jerk-off.

59:30.087 --> 59:31.146
What's happening?

59:31.148 --> 59:31.979
Watch out!

59:31.981 --> 59:33.197
You'll get killed by the laser.

59:33.199 --> 59:34.030
Oh, sorry.

59:34.032 --> 59:35.385
Shield your eyes.

59:35.387 --> 59:37.088
That light can blind you.

59:37.090 --> 59:38.058
How much time do we have?

59:38.060 --> 59:40.196
It's gonna blow any second.

59:40.198 --> 59:42.112
What about this door?

59:42.114 --> 59:44.611
Oh, silly me, there is another door.

59:44.613 --> 59:46.090
Come on!

01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:19.612
We fixed it!

01:00:19.614 --> 01:00:21.418
That was a close one.

01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:22.759
Yeah, but Bob saved the day.

01:00:22.761 --> 01:00:24.474
Aw, shucks.

01:00:24.476 --> 01:00:26.922
I'd like you guys to know that
I did it just to save myself.

01:00:29.422 --> 01:00:30.788
Okay.

01:00:30.790 --> 01:00:31.623
Yes.

01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:39.258
Okay, Charlie.

01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:40.093
I'm in.

01:00:41.290 --> 01:00:42.123
What now?

01:00:42.964 --> 01:00:43.797
Huh?

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.934
I was supposed to save us.

01:00:46.936 --> 01:00:48.878
We couldn't
wait any longer, Kirk.

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:52.238
Oh, so what do you
have to say for yourselves?

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:53.938
We're sorry.

01:00:53.940 --> 01:00:55.630
What do you make of it, Doc?

01:00:55.632 --> 01:00:57.978
Well, it may be advanced schizophrenia

01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:00.618
or perhaps a drug related
psychosis impairing

01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:02.827
their ability to rationalize
their thoughts and actions.

01:01:02.829 --> 01:01:05.608
Whatever it is, I'm gonna jack 'em up

01:01:05.610 --> 01:01:07.678
if they pull that crap again.

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:09.767
Come on, let's go after 'em.

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:12.568
Did you see that?

01:01:12.570 --> 01:01:13.401
What?

01:01:13.403 --> 01:01:16.158
These plants, they're shaking.

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:18.018
I think they're tryin'
to tell us something.

01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:20.588
Charlie, plants are your best friends.

01:01:20.590 --> 01:01:23.663
Do you think you can
make telepathic contact?

01:01:23.665 --> 01:01:24.933
I can try.

01:01:25.856 --> 01:01:29.707
Ohm.

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:36.888
Well?

01:01:36.890 --> 01:01:38.422
It's Jack.

01:01:38.424 --> 01:01:39.848
Huh?

01:01:39.850 --> 01:01:40.938
It's Jack.

01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:42.318
He says he wants a beer.

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.238
- No.
- Come on.

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:45.073
Ask him.

01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:49.283
Jack, is it really you?

01:01:50.130 --> 01:01:52.828
Oh, Jack, it is you.

01:01:52.830 --> 01:01:54.723
Why did you do this to yourself?

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:59.598
I think they were turned
into plants by aliens.

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:01.828
What kind of aliens?

01:02:01.830 --> 01:02:03.878
Probably the same kind who were taking

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:05.228
over Earth when we left.

01:02:05.230 --> 01:02:08.498
So, those other two were aliens?

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:10.878
You certainly are psychic, Bob.

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:12.573
I'm glad you're on our side.

01:02:12.575 --> 01:02:14.173
I know you are.

01:02:14.175 --> 01:02:16.378
We gotta get those miserable aliens.

01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:17.548
She's right.

01:02:17.550 --> 01:02:20.243
Let's expel some gas.

01:02:29.830 --> 01:02:30.661
Down periscope.

01:02:32.484 --> 01:02:34.234
Oh, we're gaining on them.

01:02:37.210 --> 01:02:39.073
Scootie, we need more power!

01:02:39.075 --> 01:02:40.946
Me poor bombs are about
to overheat, Captain,

01:02:40.948 --> 01:02:42.898
but I'll try to get you a wee bit more.

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:46.608
Steady, steady.

01:02:46.610 --> 01:02:48.888
Fire futon torpedoes.

01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:51.554
This isn't a TV show Captain Jerk.

01:02:51.556 --> 01:02:53.377
We don't have weapons.

01:02:57.765 --> 01:02:59.781
Look at the size of that thing.

01:02:59.783 --> 01:03:02.002
It's like a gigantic greenhouse.

01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:15.248
We're too late.

01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:16.293
Now what do we do?

01:03:20.610 --> 01:03:22.243
It's time to crash this party.

01:03:22.245 --> 01:03:23.147
Hang on!

01:03:55.209 --> 01:03:58.058
I feel a disturbance in the force,

01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:01.468
as if a million plants
just cried out in terror.

01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:03.058
To hell with those weeping willows.

01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:05.208
At least we stopped their invasion.

01:04:05.210 --> 01:04:07.448
But now we've got to warn humanity.

01:04:07.450 --> 01:04:09.861
Let's get to Earth as fast as we can.

01:04:24.097 --> 01:04:27.748
Well, now that
we're back on Earth,

01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:29.673
maybe we should take a look around.

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:34.871
Whew!

01:04:44.514 --> 01:04:45.345
Huh?

01:04:50.959 --> 01:04:51.792
What?

01:04:52.697 --> 01:04:53.701
Oh.

01:04:53.703 --> 01:04:56.163
I'm not going to this party.

01:05:04.670 --> 01:05:05.838
Connie, this is Kirk.

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:07.008
What do you got?

01:05:07.010 --> 01:05:08.637
Just plants and trees.

01:05:08.639 --> 01:05:09.903
All sorts of 'em.

01:05:11.822 --> 01:05:13.811
What do you suppose it means?

01:05:13.813 --> 01:05:14.675
Huh, I don't know

01:05:14.677 --> 01:05:17.742
but there's somethin'
awfully shady about this.

01:05:18.577 --> 01:05:19.513
Bob, report.

01:05:20.483 --> 01:05:21.768
Nothing yet.

01:05:21.770 --> 01:05:24.758
Still scanning the area.

01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:25.591
Okay.

01:05:25.593 --> 01:05:27.148
Charlie?

01:05:27.150 --> 01:05:28.368
Yes?

01:05:28.370 --> 01:05:31.188
Have you seen anything unusual?

01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:33.009
Nothing I haven't seen before.

01:05:33.011 --> 01:05:35.123
Okay, Charlie, I'll get back to you.

01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:37.118
This is Connie.

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:38.213
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:05:39.417 --> 01:05:42.177
Charlie, okay, I'll get back to you.

01:05:42.179 --> 01:05:43.188
This is Bob.

01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:44.163
Oh, hi Bob.

01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:47.937
Oh, I got a headache.

01:05:51.353 --> 01:05:52.184
Whoa!

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:05.943
50 years later and he's still pissed.

01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:09.408
Crazy kid.

01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:11.638
Throw the rock then growl.

01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:14.133
Sorry, Daddy.

01:06:15.135 --> 01:06:18.021
Stupid flower out in
the middle of nowhere.

01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:24.938
What are you doin', fool?

01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:27.158
You just kicked over a plant.

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:28.668
Your carelessness just cost the life

01:06:28.670 --> 01:06:29.973
of a innocent by-stalker.

01:06:31.450 --> 01:06:33.891
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:06:33.893 --> 01:06:35.038
boys and girls...

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:37.187
Stop eatin' the popcorn
while I'm doin' my scene.

01:06:39.424 --> 01:06:42.285
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls...

01:06:43.474 --> 01:06:44.557
Now the phone's ringin'?

01:06:45.392 --> 01:06:49.228
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,

01:06:49.230 --> 01:06:50.680
Apollo commands the...

01:06:51.730 --> 01:06:52.919
Stop it!

01:06:52.921 --> 01:06:55.254
Let's get ready some more!

01:06:57.548 --> 01:06:59.188
Hummingbird motion.

01:06:59.190 --> 01:07:00.392
Let's go.

01:07:00.394 --> 01:07:01.914
Here we go.

01:07:01.916 --> 01:07:03.146
Come on.

01:07:03.148 --> 01:07:03.981
Let's go.

01:07:08.077 --> 01:07:10.284
Yeah, take that, oh.

01:07:10.286 --> 01:07:11.117
Oo.

01:07:11.119 --> 01:07:12.107
Oh, you a little wild one.

01:07:18.276 --> 01:07:19.109
Oh!

01:07:20.046 --> 01:07:23.382
Oh, give me...

01:07:26.302 --> 01:07:27.740
Take that.

01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:30.413
Oh!

01:07:30.415 --> 01:07:31.852
Missed me.

01:07:32.687 --> 01:07:34.384
Man, don't touch my hair, man.

01:07:34.386 --> 01:07:35.514
Get away from me.

01:07:35.516 --> 01:07:37.759
You ain't got nothin',
you ain't got nothin'.

01:07:39.441 --> 01:07:41.010
I'm Captain Kirk Stillwood.

01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:54.198
Who are you Bushe and what do you want?

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:57.823
I am the Lord Sovereign of
the Plant Kingdom, Holmes.

01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:01.588
Millions of years ago, plants were brought

01:08:01.590 --> 01:08:05.198
to the planet Earth but
they were used and abused.

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:06.363
Some were even eaten.

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:11.418
And for that, mankind has to pay,

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:13.938
and bitch better have my money.

01:08:13.940 --> 01:08:16.598
You mean all these plants?

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:18.649
What's left of the human race.

01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:24.008
At least everyone's gone green.

01:08:24.010 --> 01:08:26.037
How did you do it?

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:28.478
Our spores were blown all over the world

01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:31.228
and inhaled by you fool ass humans.

01:08:31.229 --> 01:08:33.667
They immediately became plants.

01:08:33.670 --> 01:08:34.959
How's that possible?

01:08:34.961 --> 01:08:36.372
Shit if I know.

01:08:37.810 --> 01:08:39.678
Hey man, can you help us out?

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:42.198
Who the hell are you?

01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:43.493
We're the Choom Gang.

01:08:43.496 --> 01:08:46.608
I'm Buzz, this here is my bro, Budd.

01:08:46.609 --> 01:08:49.609
We just got in from Venus.

01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:53.274
Somethin' smells about you two.

01:08:53.276 --> 01:08:55.082
There's a strange odor.

01:08:55.939 --> 01:08:57.031
Are you cannabis?

01:08:57.033 --> 01:08:58.058
- No man.
- No.

01:08:58.060 --> 01:08:58.890
- No man,
- No.

01:08:58.893 --> 01:08:59.724
- no, you got it all wrong.
- You got it all...

01:08:59.725 --> 01:09:00.978
Captain Snortz?

01:09:00.979 --> 01:09:02.368
At your service, Major.

01:09:02.370 --> 01:09:03.497
Take over.

01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:06.488
These plants are in need
of some real tough love.

01:09:06.490 --> 01:09:07.728
Careful, Sir.

01:09:07.729 --> 01:09:08.631
They mights be narcs.

01:09:10.450 --> 01:09:12.008
Feel no shame in what you are.

01:09:12.010 --> 01:09:16.228
Pounds is the newest line of
five blast bongs and bubblers

01:09:16.229 --> 01:09:18.388
which offer a premium smokin' experience.

01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:21.707
The Battleship has a rim around the top,

01:09:21.710 --> 01:09:26.698
makin' it easy to get to the
suction for those massive hits.

01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:27.663
That's what I'm talkin' about.

01:09:27.666 --> 01:09:28.950
Yeah.

01:09:28.952 --> 01:09:31.313
The 13 inch Mothership, whew,

01:09:32.370 --> 01:09:37.370
she's built with a
barrel and a percolator.

01:09:37.716 --> 01:09:40.475
The Rocketship, let me tell
you about the Rocketship.

01:09:40.477 --> 01:09:41.714
Mm, mm, mm.

01:09:41.716 --> 01:09:46.358
The Rocketship has a diffused downstream,

01:09:46.359 --> 01:09:47.953
allowing the user to cover the hole

01:09:47.955 --> 01:09:52.778
with the ideal suction
when they spark it up.

01:09:52.779 --> 01:09:55.149
So, whether you into flower or oil,

01:09:55.151 --> 01:09:58.168
Pounds has the perfect product for you.

01:09:58.170 --> 01:10:01.248
And remember, my most excellent hempsters

01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:04.778
go to maryjane.com for all
the latest industry news

01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:06.516
for all things cannabis, baby.

01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:09.081
What do you want Bushe?

01:10:09.083 --> 01:10:11.397
On Mars you stole somethin'.

01:10:11.399 --> 01:10:13.748
Somethin' that didn't belong to you.

01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:15.498
You mean the Big Bang Bean?

01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:17.788
The Big Bang Bean.

01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:19.008
We want it back.

01:10:19.010 --> 01:10:22.168
You'll never get it you
despicable odious alien.

01:10:22.170 --> 01:10:25.371
Captain Snortz, release the
hounds on his cray cray ass.

01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:31.053
Whoa!

01:10:31.055 --> 01:10:32.394
Ah!

01:10:32.396 --> 01:10:33.227
Whoa!

01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:34.060
Ah!

01:10:34.062 --> 01:10:36.335
- Shut your hole!
- Whoa!

01:10:36.337 --> 01:10:37.418
Whoa!

01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:38.251
- He's in trouble.
- Run, run for it!

01:10:38.253 --> 01:10:39.563
And so are we.

01:11:15.131 --> 01:11:16.698
Those aliens are everywhere.

01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:17.778
Wait a minute.

01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:19.418
Where's Kirk?

01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:20.251
I thought he was with you.

01:11:20.253 --> 01:11:22.578
Oh, we must've passed him somehow.

01:11:22.580 --> 01:11:24.828
Where the hell could his little butt be?

01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:25.661
There he is.

01:11:25.663 --> 01:11:27.313
He's out there with the aliens.

01:11:27.315 --> 01:11:29.388
Oh dear God, he's surrounded.

01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:30.278
Is he dead?

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:32.048
No, it looks like he's playing possum.

01:11:32.050 --> 01:11:33.480
I'm a possum.

01:11:33.482 --> 01:11:34.649
I'm a possum.

01:11:44.952 --> 01:11:46.119
Ah!

01:11:54.232 --> 01:11:56.442
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

01:11:58.670 --> 01:11:59.719
Huh?

01:11:59.721 --> 01:12:00.554
What?

01:12:02.350 --> 01:12:03.732
Weed killer?

01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:05.903
Die!

01:12:07.087 --> 01:12:08.772
I wanna make out with you.

01:12:09.993 --> 01:12:11.061
Yeah!

01:12:11.063 --> 01:12:11.894
Oh!

01:12:11.896 --> 01:12:12.727
Weed killer.

01:12:12.729 --> 01:12:13.562
Yeah.

01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:16.469
Unbelievable.

01:12:16.471 --> 01:12:17.632
Open the door, open the door!

01:12:17.634 --> 01:12:19.075
Open the damn door!

01:12:24.073 --> 01:12:25.548
Are you okay?

01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:26.568
Yeah.

01:12:26.570 --> 01:12:27.718
They'll be back.

01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:28.824
You can bet on it.

01:12:40.911 --> 01:12:42.448
All right.

01:12:42.450 --> 01:12:44.498
Aliens have conquered Earth.

01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:46.461
The whole human race gone.

01:12:46.463 --> 01:12:48.288
What do they want from us?

01:12:48.290 --> 01:12:50.858
They want the Big Bang Bean.

01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:51.808
What?

01:12:51.810 --> 01:12:52.728
The Big Bang Bean.

01:12:52.730 --> 01:12:54.228
I brought it back from Mars.

01:12:54.230 --> 01:12:55.768
They want it returned.

01:12:55.770 --> 01:12:57.008
So, give it to them.

01:12:57.010 --> 01:12:58.548
What good is it anyway?

01:12:58.550 --> 01:13:01.442
Well, the Big Bang
Bean has awesome power.

01:13:01.444 --> 01:13:03.358
They could use it against us.

01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:05.518
Yeah, well, maybe we
could use it against them.

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:06.351
Yeah.

01:13:06.353 --> 01:13:07.184
Where is it?

01:13:07.186 --> 01:13:09.231
It's in a top secret hiding place.

01:13:09.233 --> 01:13:11.528
Only the President of the United States

01:13:11.530 --> 01:13:14.208
and I know where it's actually located.

01:13:14.210 --> 01:13:16.358
Yes, but now that the
President's a geranium,

01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:17.356
you're the only one.

01:13:17.358 --> 01:13:19.088
I guess so.

01:13:19.090 --> 01:13:20.538
Just give us the Big Bang Bean

01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:21.648
and they'll leave us alone.

01:13:21.650 --> 01:13:24.113
No, I found it and I'm keeping it.

01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:27.968
I think it's time for
some gentle persuasion.

01:13:27.970 --> 01:13:31.778
I won't give up the Big Bang Bean,

01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:33.448
not even for the trillions of dollars

01:13:33.450 --> 01:13:35.033
out there completely unguarded.

01:13:36.410 --> 01:13:37.598
What did you say?

01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:39.238
Well, think of it, all those banks

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:41.708
and credit unions just wide open waiting

01:13:41.710 --> 01:13:43.868
for someone to walk in and clean 'em out.

01:13:43.870 --> 01:13:44.838
Yeah.

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:46.368
What a thought.

01:13:46.370 --> 01:13:47.669
I suppose none of that matters...

01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:50.663
Guys?

01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:52.693
Where'd they go?

01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:56.978
Oh, yeah, I bet they're going
on a reconnaissance mission,

01:13:56.980 --> 01:13:58.648
spyin' on those aliens.

01:13:58.650 --> 01:14:00.748
Hope they bring back somethin' we can use.

01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:03.898
Oh, you can count on it.

01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:04.900
Hm.

01:14:07.666 --> 01:14:10.058
It's been four hours.

01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:11.938
We should've heard from them by now.

01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:13.718
Oh, give 'em time.

01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:16.342
They've probably got their hands full.

01:14:17.177 --> 01:14:18.858
Oh, someone
just climbed the fence.

01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:19.773
That must be them.

01:14:21.010 --> 01:14:22.768
I knew they'd have their hands full.

01:14:22.770 --> 01:14:24.093
Oh, they sure do.

01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:26.633
Look at those aliens.

01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:30.372
No, don't stop.

01:14:30.374 --> 01:14:31.995
Oh!

01:14:31.997 --> 01:14:33.298
I can't look.

01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:34.768
Oh!

01:14:34.770 --> 01:14:36.528
This is Buttock.

01:14:36.530 --> 01:14:38.348
Escape is impossible.

01:14:38.350 --> 01:14:41.128
You have three minutes left.

01:14:41.130 --> 01:14:42.248
They've got us surrounded.

01:14:42.250 --> 01:14:43.888
It's hopeless.

01:14:43.890 --> 01:14:46.752
Maybe I should just give
them the Big Bang Bean.

01:14:46.754 --> 01:14:50.178
No wait, I just had a stroke of genius.

01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:52.118
Well, whatever it is, it won't work.

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:54.741
We left it on the Moon!

01:14:54.743 --> 01:14:56.789
They won't fall for that.

01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:05.768
Well, they fell for that.

01:15:05.770 --> 01:15:07.583
Boy, plants really are stupid.

01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:11.668
I guess that takes care of the aliens.

01:15:11.670 --> 01:15:12.503
Not quite.

01:15:14.233 --> 01:15:15.064
Oh!

01:15:15.899 --> 01:15:16.730
Oh, oh the violence!

01:15:16.732 --> 01:15:18.167
I'm sorry, Stillwood,

01:15:18.169 --> 01:15:21.793
but I've gotta kill those aliens myself.

01:15:21.795 --> 01:15:22.795
Ow, okay.

01:15:34.684 --> 01:15:35.515
Kirk?

01:15:38.255 --> 01:15:39.230
Can you hear me?

01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:44.707
I feel so, so woody.

01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:49.258
Can you hear me, Kirk?

01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:50.091
Connie?

01:15:50.093 --> 01:15:50.924
Is that you?

01:15:50.926 --> 01:15:51.968
Who else?

01:15:51.970 --> 01:15:54.178
Well, you could be an alien.

01:15:54.180 --> 01:15:56.948
The computer shows you're
only 30 miles from the Moon.

01:15:56.950 --> 01:15:58.288
Why are you going there?

01:15:58.290 --> 01:15:59.838
I am gonna give
them the Big Bang Bean.

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:02.963
Well, you don't have the Big Bang Bean.

01:16:02.965 --> 01:16:04.859
Connie Oh, really?

01:16:04.861 --> 01:16:06.388
Go check the secret hiding place.

01:16:06.390 --> 01:16:07.221
Huh?

01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:12.383
All right, I know the Big Bang
Bean is in here somewhere.

01:16:13.224 --> 01:16:14.158
Where is it?

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:14.993
Where is it?

01:16:15.910 --> 01:16:17.007
Damn it!

01:16:18.090 --> 01:16:19.188
Okay.

01:16:19.190 --> 01:16:20.708
How did you know where it was?

01:16:20.710 --> 01:16:22.598
You talk in your sleep.

01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:23.518
What else did I say?

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:25.678
Oh, something about dipping me in honey

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:28.451
and strapping me into gravity boots.

01:16:28.453 --> 01:16:30.448
Oh, I must've been delirious.

01:16:30.450 --> 01:16:31.888
Look, if you damage the Big Bang Bean,

01:16:31.890 --> 01:16:35.628
there'll be a huge
explosion like a supernova.

01:16:35.630 --> 01:16:36.461
It's okay.

01:16:36.463 --> 01:16:38.189
I have to give my life away.

01:16:38.191 --> 01:16:39.928
It's something I've always wanted to do.

01:16:39.930 --> 01:16:41.128
Stop it!

01:16:41.130 --> 01:16:42.377
Connie, please, stop it.

01:16:42.379 --> 01:16:43.968
You can't do this to me.

01:16:45.901 --> 01:16:46.734
Connie!

01:16:49.686 --> 01:16:54.686
Connie!

01:17:10.603 --> 01:17:12.537
The Moon!

01:17:14.423 --> 01:17:16.331
Oh no!

01:17:40.908 --> 01:17:43.364
No.

01:17:43.366 --> 01:17:44.199
No!

01:17:45.094 --> 01:17:47.163
No, no.

01:17:47.165 --> 01:17:51.158
The Moon is gone.

01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:52.608
The Moon gone.

01:17:52.610 --> 01:17:53.441
Gone.

01:17:53.443 --> 01:17:54.274
Gone.

01:17:54.276 --> 01:17:55.108
Gone is the Moon.

01:17:55.110 --> 01:17:56.858
That means Connie's gone.

01:17:56.860 --> 01:17:57.691
Bob's gone.

01:17:57.693 --> 01:17:58.524
Charlie's gone.

01:17:58.526 --> 01:17:59.357
Gone!

01:17:59.359 --> 01:18:01.568
Oh, everybody's gone.

01:18:01.570 --> 01:18:02.703
No, no, no!

01:18:05.428 --> 01:18:06.428
Wait a minute.

01:18:06.430 --> 01:18:07.884
I'm still here.

01:18:07.886 --> 01:18:12.748
I guess every cloud does
have a silver lining.

01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:14.368
Let's see.

01:18:14.370 --> 01:18:15.618
The radiation from that blast

01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:17.928
will reach lethal levels in four hours.

01:18:17.930 --> 01:18:20.648
Just enough time for me to jump

01:18:20.650 --> 01:18:23.913
a shuttle and go someplace else.

01:18:24.910 --> 01:18:27.970
Maybe Uranus.

01:18:27.972 --> 01:18:30.833
I've always wondered how it got that name.

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:33.690
Must've been a deranged proctologist.

01:18:34.570 --> 01:18:35.403
Yes.

01:18:36.855 --> 01:18:37.686
Hm.

01:18:45.054 --> 01:18:45.887
Okay.

01:18:47.690 --> 01:18:49.143
Yeah, uh huh.

01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:52.053
All right.

01:18:59.926 --> 01:19:01.213
Whoa.

01:19:06.510 --> 01:19:07.888
Cheryl?

01:19:07.890 --> 01:19:09.319
What are you doing here?

01:19:09.321 --> 01:19:12.997
My name is Anne, Anne Droid.

01:19:12.999 --> 01:19:16.325
I was designed in the image of your wife.

01:19:16.327 --> 01:19:18.668
Somebody must really hate me.

01:19:18.670 --> 01:19:20.218
You are my purpose.

01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:22.120
- My reason to exist.
- Oh.

01:19:22.122 --> 01:19:24.008
I was programmed to function like

01:19:24.010 --> 01:19:26.298
a normal human female to provide

01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:30.993
for your satisfaction and to
quench every carnal desire.

01:19:31.913 --> 01:19:34.408
I didn't wanna be with the real one.

01:19:34.410 --> 01:19:36.799
Why would I engage in
coitus with an imitation?

01:19:36.801 --> 01:19:39.858
I am to be the mother
of the next human race.

01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:41.748
This body is yours.

01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:44.633
Let me be your mate for all eternity.

01:19:51.095 --> 01:19:51.928
Oo.

01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:54.743
Uranus, here I come!

01:20:07.092 --> 01:20:08.508
Oh, I can't stand this.

01:20:08.510 --> 01:20:09.473
What time is it?

01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:12.969
We leave in two minutes.

01:20:12.971 --> 01:20:14.439
Huh?

01:20:14.441 --> 01:20:15.892
What's your problem?

01:20:19.624 --> 01:20:22.173
Stillwood's heartbeat
just jumped off the scale.

01:20:23.007 --> 01:20:26.158
Kirk, are you doing
what I think you're doing?

01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:28.223
Of course, it was a premonition.

01:20:28.225 --> 01:20:30.578
I've seen the future.

01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:33.688
I know what will happen,
but now I can change it.

01:20:33.690 --> 01:20:36.128
Have you lost your mind?

01:20:36.130 --> 01:20:38.368
Connie, contact Amber Earhardt.

01:20:38.370 --> 01:20:40.398
Tell her to find Bushe and inject him

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:42.578
with a lethal dose of Dick Weed Killer.

01:20:42.580 --> 01:20:43.795
Dick Weed Killer?

01:20:44.630 --> 01:20:45.538
Don't argue with me.

01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:47.048
It's the only thing that will stop him.

01:20:47.050 --> 01:20:48.778
Are you sure you're all right?

01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:52.293
Bob, for the first time in
my life, I know what I'm doing.

01:20:54.730 --> 01:20:57.263
I'm ready for them this time.

01:21:21.260 --> 01:21:24.260
It's time to flower my little kumquat.

01:21:26.466 --> 01:21:27.961
Bloom.

01:21:27.963 --> 01:21:31.208
Oh, Auntie Petunia, it's you.

01:21:31.210 --> 01:21:32.823
How long was I hibernating?

01:21:33.740 --> 01:21:36.961
Oh, it's been nearly three harvests now.

01:21:36.963 --> 01:21:39.333
Are you strong enough to sprout?

01:21:40.530 --> 01:21:41.745
I suppose so.

01:21:41.747 --> 01:21:43.893
What a horrible dream I had.

01:21:46.570 --> 01:21:47.678
Oh, that feels good.

01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:49.268
Can I have another?

01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:51.018
Of course, dear.

01:21:51.020 --> 01:21:55.621
Oh, Auntie Petunia, you sure
know how to till the soil.

01:21:55.623 --> 01:21:58.538
I certainly should,

01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:01.887
after all the fields
I've plowed.

01:22:03.950 --> 01:22:04.978
And who are you?

01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:07.478
Like, I'm Nurse Uri.

01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:10.056
I'm gonna need a stool sample.

01:22:10.058 --> 01:22:11.440
Wait a minute.

01:22:15.250 --> 01:22:17.878
You gave us all quite a scare.

01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:19.796
For awhile there, we thought

01:22:19.798 --> 01:22:23.088
you were going to leave us.

01:22:23.090 --> 01:22:24.928
Oh, but I did leave.

01:22:24.930 --> 01:22:26.803
Aunt Petunia, I leave to Mars

01:22:26.805 --> 01:22:31.433
and went to Earth and you and
you and you were there, too.

01:22:32.890 --> 01:22:35.378
The people there weren't very nice,

01:22:35.380 --> 01:22:37.567
especially this little limp idiot.

01:22:37.569 --> 01:22:38.498
Hm!

01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:41.588
He even tried to pump me
full of Dick Weed Killer.

01:22:41.590 --> 01:22:42.720
Oh my dear.

01:22:43.847 --> 01:22:46.274
You have such an imagination.

01:22:47.450 --> 01:22:48.992
Oh, Dodo, we're home,

01:22:48.994 --> 01:22:53.258
and I'm never going to leave
again because I love you all.

01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:54.518
Oh, Auntie Petunia?

01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:55.498
Yes, dear?

01:22:55.500 --> 01:22:57.284
There's no place like home.

01:23:05.866 --> 01:23:07.781
Holy horse dump,

01:23:07.783 --> 01:23:10.333
what a massive bender that was.

01:23:11.410 --> 01:23:15.403
My head's pounding so
hard, it's turning blue.

01:23:16.370 --> 01:23:19.343
What the hell was this cheap ass shit?

01:23:21.170 --> 01:23:23.751
Oh, this damn Cranya again.

01:23:23.753 --> 01:23:26.144
Serves me right for drinking anything

01:23:26.146 --> 01:23:28.428
with a flying skull on it.

01:23:28.430 --> 01:23:30.519
What a nightmare.

01:23:30.521 --> 01:23:34.199
I was surrounded by plants and a puppet,

01:23:34.201 --> 01:23:36.827
a hamster and a chicken

01:23:36.829 --> 01:23:38.879
and the stupidest people in the universe.

01:23:40.698 --> 01:23:41.717
I told 'em to shut their holes
but they wouldn't listen.

01:23:47.652 --> 01:23:49.639
What's so funny?

01:23:49.641 --> 01:23:50.850
I've been laughin' since

01:23:50.852 --> 01:23:54.857
you passed out, fool.

01:23:54.859 --> 01:23:58.442
Oh,
just shut your hole.

01:23:59.379 --> 01:24:00.210
Yo,

01:24:00.212 --> 01:24:01.043
over here not over here.

01:24:01.045 --> 01:24:02.097
Yo, sit down, all right?

01:24:02.099 --> 01:24:03.008
You thought it was over.

01:24:03.010 --> 01:24:04.091
Well, forget about it.

01:24:04.093 --> 01:24:06.158
This damn thing is never gonna
end, you understand that?

01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:07.278
You're in purgatory.

01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:10.298
That's why they call me The
Gardener of Frickin' Forever.

01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:11.888
Watch what happens when they enter

01:24:11.890 --> 01:24:13.328
this hot mess in an award show.

01:24:13.330 --> 01:24:16.056
Welcome, to
the Gilded Horn Awards.

01:24:16.058 --> 01:24:17.073
What, Mommy?

01:24:17.075 --> 01:24:17.908
Stop it.

01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:25.317
♪ After today, I'll be incredible ♪

01:24:25.319 --> 01:24:30.037

This year's Gilded Horn
Award for best original song,

01:24:57.150 --> 01:24:58.904
goes to Miss Emily Stanton.

01:24:59.739 --> 01:25:01.238
I would like to thank the Academy.

01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:03.384
You love me, you really love me!

01:25:09.317 --> 01:25:13.020
The Gilded Horn Awards have
celebrated artistic merit

01:25:14.010 --> 01:25:19.010
in the motion picture industry
for the past 2,000 years.

01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:22.448
Coveted by filmmakers around the world,

01:25:22.450 --> 01:25:23.928
there's little doubt that everyone wants

01:25:23.930 --> 01:25:25.584
to get their hands on a Horny.

01:25:25.586 --> 01:25:30.586
Congratulations to all the
Horny winners here tonight,

01:25:31.310 --> 01:25:36.310
and to the Horny losers,
better luck next time.

01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:40.498
And now to introduce the
final award of the evening.

01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:44.858
It is my privilege to
introduce to sci-fi legends.

01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:47.218
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome

the lovely Marina Sirtis
and Robert Picardo.

01:25:59.030 --> 01:26:01.915
The nominees for Best Picture are,

01:26:01.917 --> 01:26:04.057
"Back with the Wind,"

01:26:04.059 --> 01:26:05.468
the heart wrenching story

01:26:05.470 --> 01:26:09.083
of a submarine crew battling
suffocating flatulence.

01:26:09.949 --> 01:26:11.362
"The Sodfather,"

01:26:11.364 --> 01:26:16.058
the saga of a poor gardener
turning his day job

01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:18.865
into a dirty family business.

01:26:18.867 --> 01:26:20.648
"Westside Story,"

01:26:20.650 --> 01:26:23.988
a tale of millions of Angeleno's searching

01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:27.433
in vain for that dream, a parking space.

01:26:28.407 --> 01:26:30.278
"Forrest Dump,"

01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:33.478
the tragic tale of a young man forced

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:36.498
to relieve himself in the wilderness.

01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:39.467
And finally, "The Sound of Muzak."

01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:45.448
A young nun descends into
madness after being von Trapp-ed

01:26:45.450 --> 01:26:47.963
in an elevator for 98 harrowing hours.

01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:51.433
And the award goes to,

01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:56.673
unbelievable!

01:26:58.426 --> 01:27:00.378
Oh, thank you, thank you!

01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:01.968
Thank you very much.

01:27:01.970 --> 01:27:03.608
I'd like to thank the Academy

01:27:03.610 --> 01:27:07.868
for this overdue recognition
of my immense talent.

01:27:07.870 --> 01:27:09.923
Oh yes, of course, my fellow thespians

01:27:09.925 --> 01:27:12.338
come join me up here on stage.

01:27:12.340 --> 01:27:13.718
Come on guys!

01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:15.368
Make room.

01:27:15.370 --> 01:27:17.592
Get those nasty aliens up here, too.

01:27:20.794 --> 01:27:23.718
I'd like to thank all
the captains before me,

01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:25.828
Captain Ahab, Kangaroo, Morgan,

01:27:25.830 --> 01:27:29.181
Stubing, Picard, Phillips and Tennille!

01:27:34.231 --> 01:27:37.068
It all all began for me
back on a summer's day

01:27:37.070 --> 01:27:39.288
when my parents were feeling frisky.

01:27:39.290 --> 01:27:41.438
- Oh, hello.
- Excuse me.

01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:42.271
Yes?

01:27:42.273 --> 01:27:43.508
That award isn't for you.

01:27:43.510 --> 01:27:45.288
Well, of course it is.

01:27:45.290 --> 01:27:47.590
We're the cast and crew
of "Unbelievable!!!!!"

01:27:48.550 --> 01:27:50.808
Excuse me, excuse me, I'm really sorry,

01:27:50.810 --> 01:27:53.558
but I was just surprised at the picture

01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:58.148
which had one and just kind
of blurted out unbelievable.

01:27:58.150 --> 01:28:01.390
I'm really sorry if
there's been any confusion.

01:28:01.392 --> 01:28:03.939
- So, who won?
- I'm not sorry.

01:28:03.941 --> 01:28:06.278
It wasn't confusing to me.

01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:07.875
- So...
- Me either.

01:28:07.877 --> 01:28:11.198
So, I'm afraid, would you
all go back to your seats?

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:12.396
- I'm afraid you all have
- Whoa!

01:28:12.398 --> 01:28:13.631
- to go back to your seats.
- Run for it, guys.

01:28:13.633 --> 01:28:14.464
Run for it!

01:28:16.139 --> 01:28:16.970
What?

01:28:20.901 --> 01:28:24.053
Must leave building!

01:28:24.055 --> 01:28:25.495
♪ Today ♪

01:28:25.497 --> 01:28:30.265

me around after today ♪

01:28:30.267 --> 01:28:32.994

I do my own stunts but why?

01:28:56.462 --> 01:28:57.545
Warp speed!

01:29:14.317 --> 01:29:15.227
Hang in there, guy.

01:29:16.140 --> 01:29:16.971
We're almost there.

01:29:16.973 --> 01:29:18.388
You're lookin' good.

01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:21.689
Don't quit on us, fella.

01:29:21.691 --> 01:29:22.988
The ER's right around the corner.

01:29:22.990 --> 01:29:23.821
Stay strong.

01:29:23.823 --> 01:29:25.044
Have faith.

01:29:25.944 --> 01:29:27.758
Try to ignore the Angel
of Death surrounding you.

01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:29.160
Don't worry, pal.

01:29:30.410 --> 01:29:32.324
I'm sure someone can sew
the head back on for ya.

01:29:33.224 --> 01:29:35.379
Oh God, I can't take it.

01:29:38.041 --> 01:29:39.611
What the hell is goin' on here?

01:29:39.613 --> 01:29:40.826
Is that the victim?

01:29:40.828 --> 01:29:42.255
I need to get his statement.

01:29:42.257 --> 01:29:43.925
Get lost, gumshoe.

01:29:43.927 --> 01:29:46.763
Nobody blows off Detective Dan Marr.

01:29:47.629 --> 01:29:48.460
You know something.

01:29:48.462 --> 01:29:50.138
Now cough it up.

01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:54.930
Oh, won't talk, huh?

01:29:54.932 --> 01:29:57.348
I know how to get a confession
out of a punk like you,

01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:58.550
and go get your partner.

01:30:02.541 --> 01:30:04.888
This is a triage area.

01:30:04.890 --> 01:30:06.558
You'll have to leave.

01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:08.138
Do I need to take everybody downtown

01:30:08.140 --> 01:30:09.688
and beat 'em with a rubber hose?

01:30:09.690 --> 01:30:11.968
I still have to get his statement.

01:30:11.970 --> 01:30:12.920
Take it outside.

01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:19.053
Pulse zero.

01:30:20.090 --> 01:30:21.798
Blood pressure, 0/0.

01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:22.868
We're losing him.

01:30:22.870 --> 01:30:24.545
Get the neurosurgeon, stat.

01:30:24.547 --> 01:30:25.380
Stat!

01:30:26.899 --> 01:30:30.000
I'm a doctor, damn
it, not a messenger boy.

01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:33.640
Let's use the paddles.

01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:36.311
Clear!

01:30:44.425 --> 01:30:46.204
Do it like this.

01:30:46.206 --> 01:30:47.623
No, like this.

01:30:47.625 --> 01:30:49.838
Oh, forgive me my young lieutenants

01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:51.879
but I have failed once again.

01:30:51.881 --> 01:30:54.698
Oh, Grandmaster,

01:30:54.700 --> 01:30:56.428
I know I'm destined for some great thing,

01:30:56.430 --> 01:30:57.998
but what I do not know.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.538
If only I can be assured that I was

01:31:00.540 --> 01:31:02.133
on my true and spiritual path.

01:31:02.995 --> 01:31:05.938
If only I can be given a sign.

01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:07.698
Just a small sign.

01:31:07.700 --> 01:31:09.437
Nothing too dramatic.

01:31:09.439 --> 01:31:10.565
Whoa!

01:31:12.350 --> 01:31:13.181
Oh!

01:31:13.183 --> 01:31:14.027
Faint signs of life.

01:31:14.029 --> 01:31:16.603
He still has a snowball's chance in hell.

01:31:17.450 --> 01:31:19.218
Doctor, patient's not breathing.

01:31:19.220 --> 01:31:21.218
His temperature is 80
degrees below normal.

01:31:21.220 --> 01:31:24.128
His body's devoid of
blood, flesh and bone.

01:31:24.130 --> 01:31:25.223
I say we call it.

01:31:27.053 --> 01:31:28.858
It's margarita time.

01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:32.428
Is there any chance
to save him, Dr. Soon?

01:31:32.430 --> 01:31:35.143
I suppose it's possible.

01:31:36.690 --> 01:31:40.873
I could transform him into
an artificial life form.

01:31:43.050 --> 01:31:45.593
But doctor, what if you're wrong?

01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:49.678
It's a chance you'll have to take.

01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:51.124
Let's have a closer inspection.

01:31:56.703 --> 01:31:57.786
Unbelievable!

01:32:04.787 --> 01:32:06.110
Hey, yeah.

01:32:06.112 --> 01:32:09.118
Well, we're having the
premier at the Coliseum.

01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:11.888
Yeah, the LA Coliseum,
can you believe that?

01:32:11.890 --> 01:32:14.998
We're expecting 100,000 or more.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:15.831
That's right.

01:32:15.833 --> 01:32:16.664
No, no.

01:32:16.666 --> 01:32:18.018
You can't have tickets.

01:32:18.020 --> 01:32:18.973
Try a scalper.

01:32:20.626 --> 01:32:21.676
TMZ, how about BFD?

01:32:23.677 --> 01:32:26.168
Get in line, Harvey.

01:32:26.170 --> 01:32:28.688
Kirk is doing "Conan" and "The View."

01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:32.698
He's got no time for your
sorry syndicated ass.

01:32:32.700 --> 01:32:33.777
Get us saturation coverage

01:32:33.779 --> 01:32:36.155
on each network's prime time slate.

01:32:36.157 --> 01:32:37.088
Yeah.

01:32:37.090 --> 01:32:39.718
I don't care what it costs.

01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:40.848
The studio's covering P&A.

01:32:40.850 --> 01:32:44.468
No, you're only getting
distribution rights

01:32:44.470 --> 01:32:47.893
for North America, that's it.

01:32:47.895 --> 01:32:52.895
We're debuting wide on 7,000 screens.

01:32:53.270 --> 01:32:57.451
Well, Europe, Asia and South
America are already gone.

01:32:57.453 --> 01:33:01.413
Well, we do have Fiji, the
Seychelles and Tasmania

01:33:01.415 --> 01:33:02.968
if you'd like those.

01:33:02.970 --> 01:33:03.801
Yeah.

01:33:03.803 --> 01:33:05.078
Who's this?

01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:08.958
Gee, we were just talkin' about you guys,

01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:11.598
over the past few decades.

01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:13.328
You wanna do a deal?

01:33:13.330 --> 01:33:14.658
Yeah.

01:33:14.660 --> 01:33:16.498
Put the chairman on.

01:33:16.500 --> 01:33:17.550
I'll hold.

01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:24.056
So, Brad, you're runnin'
things over there now, huh?

01:33:25.250 --> 01:33:27.493
Well, call us back in 40 years.

01:33:27.495 --> 01:33:28.563
We'll do lunch.

01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:32.648
I just sold our merchandising

01:33:32.650 --> 01:33:36.348
and licensing rights for 800 large.

01:33:36.350 --> 01:33:38.408
We're back on top boys and girls.

01:33:38.410 --> 01:33:39.513
- Yes!
- Yeah.

01:33:40.481 --> 01:33:41.312
I understand.

01:33:41.314 --> 01:33:43.928
- Hold on a second.
- Yeah!

01:33:43.930 --> 01:33:45.678
- Knock it off, guys.
- What?

01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:47.081
- It's CAA.
- Oh.

01:33:47.083 --> 01:33:49.148
Oh my God.

01:33:49.150 --> 01:33:52.082
You want Kirk for the lead
in the next Spielberg film?

01:33:53.481 --> 01:33:57.463
Well, I think I can speak
for him when I say he's in.

01:33:58.500 --> 01:33:59.333
Thanks a lot.

01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:02.078
Thanks a lot yourself.

01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:03.028
Don't worry.

01:34:03.030 --> 01:34:05.028
You're perfect for the role.

01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:07.425
It's a live action remake of "Pinocchio."

01:34:07.427 --> 01:34:10.353
Now you've got a chance for
what you've always wanted.

01:34:11.410 --> 01:34:14.028
No, you mean that...

01:34:14.030 --> 01:34:16.308
Yes, Kirk, yes!

01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:19.284
You're gonna become a real little actor.

01:34:20.270 --> 01:34:21.101
Yes.

I can't see.

01:34:47.983 --> 01:34:49.568
I can't find it.

Ah, I'm infected!

01:35:17.377 --> 01:35:19.030
Where was the wallet?

01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:26.648
As you can see, you have much to learn.

01:35:26.650 --> 01:35:29.610
Oh, thank you, Sensei.

01:35:29.612 --> 01:35:31.683
I will try harder.

01:35:36.580 --> 01:35:37.900
Do!

01:35:37.902 --> 01:35:40.864

Hey, look who's here.

Hi, honey.

- Boom, boom.
- Up!

01:35:54.393 --> 01:35:56.738
Do it from the door opening.

01:35:56.740 --> 01:35:57.573
Close the door.

01:35:58.694 --> 01:36:00.098
Here we go.

01:36:00.100 --> 01:36:01.668
Set.

01:36:01.670 --> 01:36:04.503
It's Kirk and
Connie and Bob and Charlie.

01:36:05.994 --> 01:36:08.803
I'm sorry, do that again.

01:36:10.924 --> 01:36:11.755
Do that again.

01:36:11.757 --> 01:36:12.672

01:36:21.645 --> 01:36:22.799
Here we go, here we go.

01:36:24.030 --> 01:36:26.133
Any friend of
Connie's is a friend of mine.

01:36:27.584 --> 01:36:28.415
Strange.

01:36:28.417 --> 01:36:29.428
All right, let's go.

01:36:29.430 --> 01:36:30.817
Whoa, I'm floating.

01:36:31.776 --> 01:36:32.800
Oh, Lord.

01:36:37.050 --> 01:36:40.412
So, what do you say?

01:36:40.414 --> 01:36:41.488
No, no, we're good.

01:36:41.490 --> 01:36:43.431
- We like it here.
- Yeah.

01:36:43.433 --> 01:36:44.433
Oh, right.

01:36:46.685 --> 01:36:47.518
Okay.

01:36:51.772 --> 01:36:55.476
Oh, I seem to have self destructed.

01:36:55.478 --> 01:36:57.178
I've fallen and I can't get up.

01:36:57.180 --> 01:36:58.213
I'm lost in thought.

01:36:59.330 --> 01:37:01.627
I'm paralyzed in thought right now.

01:37:02.902 --> 01:37:03.733
Oh, shit.

01:37:03.735 --> 01:37:04.637
Oh, shit.

01:37:07.510 --> 01:37:09.345
That doesn't sound good.

01:37:09.347 --> 01:37:10.178
There we go.

01:37:10.180 --> 01:37:11.512
- Oh, Spock!
- That's good,

01:37:11.514 --> 01:37:12.607
- everything's all right.
- To the bridge.

01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:15.741
Let's see if we can stand.

01:37:23.050 --> 01:37:23.940
Oh, wow!

01:37:25.830 --> 01:37:27.510
I seem to have lost my...

01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:30.460
I can't...

01:37:30.462 --> 01:37:31.462
Disoriented.

01:37:33.070 --> 01:37:35.171
Can't find equilibrium.

01:37:35.173 --> 01:37:36.828
Whoa!

01:37:36.830 --> 01:37:39.606
Oh maybe I'll just lay
here for a little bit.

01:37:39.608 --> 01:37:40.532
- Just rest.
- Cut!

01:37:40.534 --> 01:37:41.365
That's the cut.

01:37:42.636 --> 01:37:43.938
- 17.
- Mark.

01:37:43.940 --> 01:37:45.302
- Taking it in.
- What I was trying

01:37:45.304 --> 01:37:46.761
to do the last time but it went so fast.

01:37:46.763 --> 01:37:48.145
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Settle.

01:37:48.147 --> 01:37:49.362
Can you put
his hand in or somethin'

01:37:49.364 --> 01:37:51.418
so I get a start focus mark?

01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:52.978
Start focus mark.

01:37:52.980 --> 01:37:53.945
Here you are.

01:37:55.819 --> 01:37:56.660
Thank you.

01:37:56.662 --> 01:37:57.528
I think I got it.

01:37:57.530 --> 01:37:58.573
You're welcome.

01:37:59.550 --> 01:38:00.928
Set.

01:38:00.930 --> 01:38:01.930
Action!

01:38:02.764 --> 01:38:03.595
Oh!

01:38:03.597 --> 01:38:04.428
Emergency!

01:38:07.063 --> 01:38:07.894
Cut!

01:38:10.250 --> 01:38:12.218
Oh God, I forgot the KY!

01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:17.565
I'm waiting.

01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:24.558
Oh, someone just climbed the fence.

01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:25.913
That must be them.

01:38:27.580 --> 01:38:29.598
No, they're going the other way now.

01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:31.048
I'm confused.

01:38:31.050 --> 01:38:32.250
Where the hell are they?

01:38:33.690 --> 01:38:35.328
Wait, are they in Burbank?

01:38:35.330 --> 01:38:36.490
That looks like Burbank.

01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:42.317
Cut!

01:38:42.319 --> 01:38:43.258
Action!

01:38:43.260 --> 01:38:47.138

01:39:05.581 --> 01:39:08.250

Yo, man, I don't know.

01:44:35.859 --> 01:44:36.690
That's why I called you.

01:44:36.692 --> 01:44:38.098
All these people are here.

01:44:38.100 --> 01:44:39.355
What the hell is goin' on?

01:44:39.357 --> 01:44:41.678
- Excuse me, who are you?
- I'm Sam Asghari.

01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:42.558
It's his house.

01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:43.438
This is a closed set.

01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:44.618
You're gonna have to leave.

01:44:44.620 --> 01:44:45.618
What do you mean we have to leave?

01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:46.451
You have to leave.

01:44:46.453 --> 01:44:48.782
This is my home jerk-off, get outta here.

01:44:48.784 --> 01:44:49.615
Get out, guys.

01:44:49.617 --> 01:44:50.448
Get out.

01:44:50.450 --> 01:44:52.408
Man, where's the production?

01:44:52.410 --> 01:44:53.468

01:45:13.874 --> 01:45:15.228
Isolate, isolate!
