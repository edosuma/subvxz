00:08.950 --> 00:12.136
Consequences for noncompliance
is what there needs to be.

00:13.631 --> 00:16.873
It was just two stupid words on
a stupid paper.

00:16.951 --> 00:19.677
I had a sister,
died many years ago.

00:19.753 --> 00:21.620
Her name was Yuko.

00:21.622 --> 00:25.316
Children can't be raised on the streets.

00:25.393 --> 00:29.654
Taizo. Is that...
The name she gave you.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.464
She's my blood.

00:31.540 --> 00:32.723
You're nothing.

03:28.417 --> 03:29.750
What are you
doing out here?

03:32.496 --> 03:34.980
Just enjoying the great
American landscape.

03:34.982 --> 03:36.799
Again.

03:42.990 --> 03:45.266
She still hasn't
written me back.

03:45.342 --> 03:47.435
Is there...

03:47.511 --> 03:49.328
any way I can call her?

03:49.405 --> 03:51.513
Does Bowen have
a direct line?

03:51.590 --> 03:53.089
Chester,
I can't let you do that.

03:53.167 --> 03:56.152
They'd ship us both
to Tule Lake.

03:57.338 --> 04:01.023
Bowen records everything
in that office.

04:01.099 --> 04:02.599
Hey, instead of that,

04:02.677 --> 04:04.076
maybe you should talk
with your parents?

04:05.513 --> 04:07.163
You know who I mean.

04:08.774 --> 04:12.126
Was that Toshiro coughing
the last few nights?

04:12.203 --> 04:15.187
Walls are so thin
I could hear him.

04:15.189 --> 04:17.630
Asako-san and Henry-san
are looking after him.

04:17.708 --> 04:21.117
But you're still
their son.

04:21.195 --> 04:24.454
If I had known who I was,

04:24.532 --> 04:28.476
whose son I really was,

04:28.552 --> 04:32.054
I could've protected Luz,

04:32.130 --> 04:34.707
and our boys.

04:34.783 --> 04:38.694
If they hadn't lied to me
my entire life.

04:59.233 --> 05:03.569
It's a beautiful
day today.

05:03.571 --> 05:06.905
The Gallegos

05:06.907 --> 05:09.575
are finally painting
their front porch.

05:09.577 --> 05:12.594
Pink.

05:12.671 --> 05:17.274
I guess Marta finally
got her way after all.

05:23.774 --> 05:25.682
Luz.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.426
You need to get out.

05:27.428 --> 05:28.928
Meet new people.

05:29.004 --> 05:30.854
I don't want you
wasting your life

05:30.931 --> 05:32.431
just wallowing
in misery.

05:32.433 --> 05:33.666
Thanks.

05:34.935 --> 05:38.087
I'll take it
under consideration.

05:45.704 --> 05:48.280
Did you have dinner with
that young man from church?

05:48.282 --> 05:49.298
Julio?

05:49.374 --> 05:51.559
I prefer to eat at home.

05:51.635 --> 05:52.801
You can't expect
someone like Julio

05:52.878 --> 05:54.044
to come along every day.

05:54.121 --> 05:57.472
He's from a good
Catholic family,

05:57.549 --> 06:00.884
and since he just moved here
for medical school,

06:00.962 --> 06:02.719
he doesn't know...

06:02.797 --> 06:04.071
That I got knocked-up

06:04.148 --> 06:05.239
by a Japanese man

06:05.316 --> 06:06.365
and ran away with him?

06:07.768 --> 06:09.968
I told Julio you'd be happy
to have dinner with him,

06:09.970 --> 06:12.663
and I'd prefer
to not be made into a liar.

06:38.182 --> 06:39.181
Yup.

06:39.257 --> 06:41.859
He sent
another one.

06:48.008 --> 06:51.118
You collect these
like paper dolls.

06:51.195 --> 06:53.829
and I am sick of it.

07:28.716 --> 07:31.066
Chester.

07:31.143 --> 07:32.142
Package for you.

07:32.219 --> 07:33.077
From Los Angeles.

08:28.442 --> 08:29.341
Hey!

08:30.619 --> 08:33.053
What do you think
you're doing?

08:33.130 --> 08:35.097
You don't have permission
to exit this gate!

08:38.342 --> 08:40.043
Stop,
or I'll shoot!

08:40.120 --> 08:41.061
If you want to shoot
a sergeant in the back,

08:41.138 --> 08:42.187
it's fine by me, private.

08:44.516 --> 08:45.274
Stop right there!

09:03.609 --> 09:05.919
Transport's here.
Let's go.

09:07.815 --> 09:10.332
Chester,
what happened?

09:10.408 --> 09:13.485
Your lunatic son
tried to go AWOL.

09:13.487 --> 09:14.410
I heard he pulled
the same trick

09:14.488 --> 09:15.929
in Guadalcanal.

09:23.998 --> 09:24.997
In English.

09:25.073 --> 09:26.874
Where are you
taking our son?

09:26.876 --> 09:30.093
Well, he's lost his privilege
to be here in my relo center.

09:30.171 --> 09:31.670
There's another
facility

09:31.672 --> 09:33.522
at Tule Lake,

09:33.598 --> 09:34.856
for agitators.

09:34.933 --> 09:36.933
Please,
Major Bowen,

09:37.011 --> 09:38.026
have mercy.

09:38.103 --> 09:39.787
He's been through so much.

09:39.863 --> 09:41.513
He is a soldier, like you...

09:41.515 --> 09:43.273
I have
shown him mercy,

09:43.350 --> 09:45.125
too much of it.

09:46.145 --> 09:47.443
Nakayama,

09:47.521 --> 09:49.371
it's gonna
be a while, son.

09:49.447 --> 09:50.297
You got anything

09:50.374 --> 09:53.358
you wanna say
to your parents?

09:53.360 --> 09:56.261
My parents are dead.

09:57.531 --> 10:00.015
Go on, move out!

10:37.754 --> 10:39.388
Asako-san,
it's getting worse.

11:06.100 --> 11:07.040
Hey.

11:08.118 --> 11:09.101
What's wrong
with him?

11:09.103 --> 11:10.102
I don't know.

11:10.104 --> 11:11.527
He's burning up,

11:11.605 --> 11:12.629
and he can barely breathe.

11:20.038 --> 11:21.463
It hit my block
last night.

11:21.539 --> 11:23.056
22 and 23 today.

11:23.133 --> 11:24.207
No one knows
what to do.

11:24.284 --> 11:25.225
Where are the doctors?

11:25.302 --> 11:26.635
There's only two
and they're both sick,

11:26.711 --> 11:29.646
so it's just...
it's whoever volunteers.

11:35.796 --> 11:36.904
Tell your boss

11:36.980 --> 11:38.572
that he needs to get
the sick to a hospital,

11:38.649 --> 11:40.482
or get real doctors
in here.

11:40.558 --> 11:42.450
Ken, he's not really the type
to listen to advice.

11:42.528 --> 11:44.319
I know you like the safety
of being Bowen's pet,

11:44.396 --> 11:45.746
but if he doesn't do
something quick,

11:45.822 --> 11:47.289
people are gonna die.

13:06.236 --> 13:08.811
Hey!

13:08.889 --> 13:10.414
What are you doing?

13:12.059 --> 13:13.241
That's
a men's barrack.

13:13.318 --> 13:14.960
That better not be
what I think it is.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.506
What is that?

13:22.236 --> 13:23.677
Where are you going?

13:25.756 --> 13:27.088
Oh, you just gonna ignore me?

13:27.165 --> 13:28.724
I'll show you
who runs this place, huh?

14:07.447 --> 14:09.056
I gotta crap.

14:13.453 --> 14:14.969
Out there or in here,

14:15.046 --> 14:16.730
up to you.

14:30.971 --> 14:33.229
I heard
in Guadalcanal,

14:33.307 --> 14:37.158
the mosquitos
crawl up your ass.

14:37.235 --> 14:40.420
Is that true?

14:40.497 --> 14:41.880
Sure.

15:06.006 --> 15:06.804
You done already?

15:12.270 --> 15:13.537
Stop!

15:14.906 --> 15:16.348
Freeze!

15:16.350 --> 15:17.582
I'll blow your head off!

16:14.908 --> 16:17.184
Major Bowen, sir?

16:17.260 --> 16:19.911
There's been an outbreak.

16:19.913 --> 16:21.079
No one knows what.

16:21.081 --> 16:23.506
People are running fevers,
fighting for breath.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.600
Mostly the children
and the elderly.

16:25.677 --> 16:27.085
I tried to inform you
last night,

16:27.087 --> 16:28.603
but I couldn't find you.

16:28.680 --> 16:31.072
Oh, I was, um...

16:32.759 --> 16:34.826
I was out.

16:39.691 --> 16:41.691
You'll have to forgive
my current state.

16:41.768 --> 16:45.119
I... have no idea
what's come over me.

16:45.196 --> 16:47.022
Well, there's
something spreading.

16:47.024 --> 16:48.715
It could be TB,
maybe influenza.

16:48.792 --> 16:50.866
I hope you're not
infected...

16:50.944 --> 16:52.444
Why are they
doing this to me?

16:52.446 --> 16:53.445
Major, the infirmary,

16:53.447 --> 16:54.554
it needs...

16:54.631 --> 16:56.114
Every other thing
your people do

16:56.116 --> 16:57.682
is some kind of
superstition.

16:58.626 --> 16:59.951
Bock-a-moany this.

16:59.953 --> 17:00.969
Yoo-rye that.

17:01.045 --> 17:02.878
Hell, I can't even
get half of them

17:02.956 --> 17:04.231
to look me in the eye.

17:04.307 --> 17:07.625
At first, I thought maybe
it was out of respect or fear,

17:07.627 --> 17:08.643
and, frankly,

17:08.720 --> 17:10.127
either one of those
is fine with me.

17:10.204 --> 17:13.131
Sir, you run a good... center,

17:13.133 --> 17:14.632
but we're not built to handle

17:14.634 --> 17:15.724
an outbreak
of this scale.

17:15.801 --> 17:17.577
We don't have the supplies
or the personnel.

17:17.654 --> 17:19.412
Can we at least transfer
the children to a hospital...

17:19.489 --> 17:23.733
The reason they won't
look me in the eye

17:23.810 --> 17:27.127
is because they know
something that I don't know.

17:27.204 --> 17:31.149
Now, until somebody tells me
what kind of evil spirit

17:31.151 --> 17:34.243
or oriental magic tricks
are taking over this place,

17:34.321 --> 17:36.054
nobody's leaving.

17:39.284 --> 17:42.269
Your people made this mess.

17:42.345 --> 17:45.146
Now you gotta live with it.

17:50.412 --> 17:53.280
What the hell
happened to you?

17:56.976 --> 17:58.359
Amy! Amy, hold up.

17:58.436 --> 17:59.786
Did you talk to Bowen?
What did he say?

17:59.863 --> 18:01.362
He said no.
I tried.

18:01.439 --> 18:03.606
"I tried" isn't gonna
save these kids.

18:03.683 --> 18:04.607
Are we supposed to
watch them try to breathe

18:04.684 --> 18:05.458
until they can't?

18:05.535 --> 18:06.684
Ken, I can't talk right now.

18:06.686 --> 18:07.852
You have to
do something.

18:07.854 --> 18:08.778
I'm trying.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.021
Why don't you
do something.

18:10.023 --> 18:11.339
Or maybe you're just
all talk?

18:15.695 --> 18:18.305
Asako-san, Henry-san,
can we speak a moment?

18:21.959 --> 18:23.051
What's wrong?

18:23.127 --> 18:24.552
It's Chester.

18:24.629 --> 18:26.037
Chester?

18:26.039 --> 18:27.872
Is he all right?

18:27.874 --> 18:29.774
Nobody knows.

18:57.495 --> 18:58.586
Who sent you here?

18:58.663 --> 19:00.646
What?

19:00.723 --> 19:02.256
These are staff quarters.
Who let you come over here?

19:02.333 --> 19:03.183
No one.
There's a medical emergency...

19:03.259 --> 19:05.042
- Did she send you?
- Who?

19:05.120 --> 19:05.894
What does she want
with me?

19:08.707 --> 19:10.339
Does she want revenge?

19:10.417 --> 19:11.416
Is that it?

19:11.418 --> 19:12.433
You tell that demon

19:12.510 --> 19:13.693
that this place
wasn't even my idea, okay?

19:13.770 --> 19:15.695
This is just my goddamn job.

19:15.772 --> 19:17.513
You think I like being locked up
with the rest of you?

19:17.591 --> 19:18.981
Listen to me,
there's a medical emergency...

19:19.058 --> 19:20.367
What does she want from me!

19:44.951 --> 19:46.634
You want a demon?

19:46.711 --> 19:47.852
Now you got one.

19:55.552 --> 19:58.238
I hope I didn't
talk too much for you.

20:02.135 --> 20:05.060
I... I'd like
to see you again,

20:05.138 --> 20:07.038
if that's okay.

20:09.993 --> 20:12.401
Don't worry,

20:12.479 --> 20:14.737
I wasn't gonna try
to kiss you.

20:14.815 --> 20:16.497
I'm not one of those guys

20:16.574 --> 20:19.717
with ten gals
lined up for dates.

20:20.670 --> 20:21.928
I like you.

20:22.005 --> 20:23.930
You don't know me.

20:24.007 --> 20:26.224
I'd like to.

20:27.585 --> 20:28.268
Your father says

20:28.344 --> 20:30.178
you haven't been
out a lot.

20:30.254 --> 20:33.606
That you were gonna
be a nun before the war.

20:33.683 --> 20:35.567
I think that's...
honorable.

20:37.254 --> 20:40.262
Thank you for dinner, Julio.

20:40.340 --> 20:41.614
I should call it a night.

20:41.691 --> 20:43.074
I'm just saying...

20:46.029 --> 20:47.195
I don't want to rush you
into anything

20:47.271 --> 20:49.456
you're not ready for.

20:49.532 --> 20:51.458
I appreciate that.

20:51.534 --> 20:52.542
Good night.

20:53.703 --> 20:54.586
Good night.

21:22.882 --> 21:25.975
You never answered
my letters.

21:26.052 --> 21:29.053
I couldn't even
open them.

21:29.055 --> 21:30.479
Why not?

21:30.557 --> 21:31.405
Because I knew,

21:31.482 --> 21:32.749
if I opened them...

21:34.227 --> 21:36.127
I'd hear your voice again.

21:41.735 --> 21:42.917
I never got to see you...

21:42.994 --> 21:44.260
Don't.

21:47.090 --> 21:50.091
The girl you loved?

21:50.167 --> 21:52.835
The one who loved you?

21:52.912 --> 21:55.188
She's buried,

21:55.265 --> 21:56.981
with them.

21:58.993 --> 22:03.938
Everything about you hurts me.

22:04.015 --> 22:06.591
Do you know who I was
an hour ago?

22:06.593 --> 22:09.944
Sweet, quiet Luz,

22:10.021 --> 22:13.706
on a date with a guy
who thought I was...

22:13.783 --> 22:15.708
I was scared of kissing him,

22:15.785 --> 22:19.028
and I was thinking,

22:19.105 --> 22:21.122
if I smile enough
for this Julio,

22:21.198 --> 22:22.940
he'll never expect me

22:22.942 --> 22:27.345
to ever say or feel
anything real with him.

22:29.206 --> 22:32.283
I could marry a man like that.

22:32.360 --> 22:35.544
If that's
what you want to do...

22:35.622 --> 22:39.399
if that's who you really are,

22:39.475 --> 22:41.651
then do it.

22:44.055 --> 22:45.738
But I don't think that's you.

22:47.266 --> 22:49.534
I'm so tired.

22:51.787 --> 22:56.249
I wake up in the morning,
and it's like I can't breathe.

22:58.736 --> 23:00.494
I can't be here
anymore.

23:00.571 --> 23:03.590
I don't have anything
to give you.

23:03.666 --> 23:06.334
I'm not asking you
for anything,

23:06.410 --> 23:08.911
but...

23:08.988 --> 23:12.006
if you would just
let me help you now,

23:12.083 --> 23:13.933
I promise you, I will.

23:14.010 --> 23:15.893
Whatever you need.

23:17.004 --> 23:19.564
Like what?

23:22.018 --> 23:24.185
I've got this.

23:24.261 --> 23:27.071
My old professor
kept it good as new.

23:29.342 --> 23:30.783
If you could have
a free ride,

23:30.860 --> 23:33.119
to anywhere,

23:33.196 --> 23:35.079
where would you go?

23:55.126 --> 23:57.143
Major Bowen?

23:57.220 --> 23:58.627
Sir?

23:58.705 --> 24:00.629
It's Amy Yoshida.

24:00.707 --> 24:03.733
They're asking for you
at the office.

24:06.713 --> 24:07.712
Who followed you?

24:07.714 --> 24:08.880
Ken.

24:08.956 --> 24:09.730
What are you
doing here?

24:09.807 --> 24:11.716
Shh. It's like you said,

24:11.793 --> 24:13.150
someone's gotta
do something.

24:13.227 --> 24:14.309
Oh, God.

24:14.387 --> 24:15.236
What did you do to him?

24:15.312 --> 24:17.238
I stopped him
from killing me,

24:17.314 --> 24:18.406
and once he comes to,

24:18.482 --> 24:19.740
I'm going to make him
call in some ambulances.

24:19.817 --> 24:21.492
Ken, you can't be doing this.

24:21.569 --> 24:22.335
Do you know what's going
to happen to you?

24:22.412 --> 24:23.411
What's gonna happen

24:23.487 --> 24:24.245
to everyone
in the infirmary

24:24.321 --> 24:25.396
if I don't do this?

24:25.398 --> 24:27.565
They'll die, all of them,

24:27.567 --> 24:29.083
because everyone's
too goddamned afraid

24:29.160 --> 24:30.301
to do the right thing.

24:31.754 --> 24:32.970
I tried.

24:34.665 --> 24:36.257
I really did.

24:36.333 --> 24:39.501
Thanks for that.

24:39.579 --> 24:41.187
Get back to work
before you get into trouble.

25:24.958 --> 25:26.715
Recess!

25:26.793 --> 25:28.901
Recess, children!

25:28.978 --> 25:31.738
Everybody outside.

26:40.291 --> 26:41.265
What?

27:28.005 --> 27:28.929
Hi, Lorraine.

27:29.006 --> 27:30.339
Neville County Hospital, please.

27:30.416 --> 27:31.524
<i>One moment.</i>

27:33.177 --> 27:34.752
<i>Neville County Hospital.</i>

27:34.754 --> 27:36.362
Hi. This is Miss Yoshida
from Major Bowen's office

27:36.439 --> 27:38.422
at Colinas de Oro.

27:38.424 --> 27:40.107
The Major would like
to request the transfer

27:40.184 --> 27:42.851
of two dozen patients
from the relocation center.

27:42.929 --> 27:45.779
We'll require ambulances
right away.

27:45.856 --> 27:46.931
See you at the gates.

27:46.933 --> 27:48.291
Thank you.

27:50.694 --> 27:51.961
What's going on?

27:55.291 --> 27:57.866
Flying planes
into aircraft carriers.

27:57.944 --> 28:01.703
Making snacks out of the enemy.

28:01.781 --> 28:06.099
Taking military officers
hostage.

28:06.101 --> 28:09.020
Is it the Japanese blood
that makes you all that way?

28:10.547 --> 28:13.048
It's eating at you, isn't it?

28:13.126 --> 28:15.568
How you treat us.

28:15.645 --> 28:17.069
You wish there was a demon,

28:17.146 --> 28:19.130
some inhuman enemy.

28:19.132 --> 28:20.981
It'd be so much easier
for you to live with yourself.

28:21.058 --> 28:22.316
What I've done

28:22.393 --> 28:23.743
is honorably supervise

28:23.819 --> 28:28.139
and maintain a federally-ordered
relocation center.

28:28.141 --> 28:29.473
There's cases in
the courts right now.

28:29.550 --> 28:31.976
We'll all be out of these camps
within a year.

28:31.978 --> 28:33.902
Are you really going to keep
lying to yourself

28:33.980 --> 28:35.813
that what you've done
is honorable?

28:35.815 --> 28:38.257
Or are you gonna come with me
to your office,

28:38.334 --> 28:40.242
pick up the phone,
and call an ambulance

28:40.319 --> 28:41.928
so innocent people
don't die?

28:42.004 --> 28:43.988
The second
we walk in that building,

28:44.065 --> 28:48.100
they'll be on you
like flies on shit.

28:51.330 --> 28:52.254
And if they are,

28:52.332 --> 28:54.165
I'll shoot you.

28:54.167 --> 28:56.834
Then who's gonna call
the ambulances?

28:56.836 --> 28:58.069
You think of that?

29:00.022 --> 29:02.247
Then maybe I'll shoot you
in the gut right here.

29:02.324 --> 29:05.201
I'll get the ambulances
to come that way.

29:06.679 --> 29:08.120
Do it.

29:09.273 --> 29:12.107
I was at Belleau Wood.

29:12.185 --> 29:14.460
Under Pershing.

29:14.537 --> 29:18.422
I'll bleed my guts out
before I surrender to you.

29:34.724 --> 29:36.223
Ken! It's me.

29:36.300 --> 29:38.209
- Open up.
- Are you alone?

29:38.211 --> 29:39.210
No.

29:39.212 --> 29:40.486
Gimbel's with me.

29:40.563 --> 29:41.636
I'm sorry.

29:41.714 --> 29:42.880
Anyone comes in,
I shoot the Major!

29:42.882 --> 29:44.215
Ken, don't!

29:44.217 --> 29:45.658
It's over.

29:45.735 --> 29:48.786
The kids are going
to the hospital.

29:50.056 --> 29:51.163
Come in.

29:51.240 --> 29:53.390
Just you.

29:53.392 --> 29:54.575
Anyone else,
and there's blood.

29:54.651 --> 29:56.076
Do as he says.

29:57.397 --> 29:58.796
It's locked.

30:12.912 --> 30:14.353
The ambulances
are on their way?

30:15.540 --> 30:17.356
Yeah.

30:17.433 --> 30:18.507
I called for them.

30:18.584 --> 30:20.526
You have no authority
to do that.

30:21.879 --> 30:24.012
I know.

30:24.090 --> 30:25.322
I used yours.

30:29.186 --> 30:31.779
It's not her fault.

30:31.855 --> 30:33.355
I told her
that I'd kill you

30:33.432 --> 30:34.457
if she didn't
make the call.

30:35.734 --> 30:38.193
She did it
to protect you.

30:38.271 --> 30:41.297
She'd never
cross you on her own.

30:43.109 --> 30:45.292
Gimbel,

30:45.369 --> 30:47.611
when this boy places
his weapon on the floor,

30:47.613 --> 30:48.804
I want you to stand down.

30:50.707 --> 30:52.541
Then you can cuff him.

30:52.618 --> 30:53.809
Nice and gentle.

30:55.212 --> 30:58.022
Go on, call him.

31:04.388 --> 31:06.054
Okay.

31:06.132 --> 31:07.198
You can come in.

31:29.238 --> 31:31.514
Be careful this side.

31:32.825 --> 31:34.508
Oh, and just so you know,

31:34.585 --> 31:36.994
I never bought
any of that ghost business.

31:36.996 --> 31:38.253
First thing
you're taught

31:38.331 --> 31:39.179
if you're
taken captive,

31:39.256 --> 31:41.165
is to act crazy.

31:41.167 --> 31:44.001
Throws everything
out of whack.

31:44.003 --> 31:46.019
I'll keep that in mind
at Tule Lake.

31:46.096 --> 31:47.613
Yeah.

31:47.690 --> 31:49.740
You do that.

31:51.026 --> 31:52.243
Miss Yoshida, with me.

32:07.009 --> 32:09.376
Sir, he only wanted
to get medical help

32:09.453 --> 32:11.028
for those who needed it.

32:11.030 --> 32:13.264
If you could maybe take that
into consideration?

32:14.700 --> 32:17.059
I already have.

32:19.472 --> 32:21.722
Fellas...

32:21.798 --> 32:22.982
you're needed inside.

32:27.471 --> 32:29.229
Get him to the ground.

32:29.306 --> 32:31.382
Hey, what are you doing?

32:31.384 --> 32:32.324
Hey!

32:45.314 --> 32:46.914
So his name was Jirou?

32:46.990 --> 32:47.882
Yeah.

32:50.586 --> 32:52.569
I have a brother.

32:52.571 --> 32:53.587
Somewhere.

32:53.664 --> 32:55.906
Did another family adopt him?

32:55.908 --> 32:56.998
It just says

32:57.076 --> 32:58.017
he was sent to
a children's hospital

32:58.093 --> 32:59.435
at eight months.

33:00.930 --> 33:02.104
After that...?

33:03.416 --> 33:05.191
So if he's alive,

33:05.267 --> 33:08.435
he's probably in some camp,

33:08.512 --> 33:10.845
under an adopted name,

33:10.923 --> 33:12.180
wondering why
he's always felt

33:12.258 --> 33:13.824
like half of him's missing.

33:18.014 --> 33:18.913
Anyway...

33:22.192 --> 33:23.959
it's nothing
for you to worry about.

33:27.864 --> 33:30.216
Care to tell me
where I'm taking you?

33:30.292 --> 33:32.125
Aguayo.

33:32.202 --> 33:33.277
New Mexico.

33:33.279 --> 33:35.203
Why there?

33:35.281 --> 33:36.521
It's where
my mom grew up.

33:36.523 --> 33:38.933
My father used to send us there
in the summer.

33:40.453 --> 33:42.469
My abuela and I
would make birria

33:42.546 --> 33:46.290
and pray to the saints together.

33:46.292 --> 33:49.235
My cousin, Hector,
would trap rabbits.

33:49.311 --> 33:52.196
He said it was
sweeter than goat.

33:53.983 --> 33:57.076
My brother hated it.

33:57.152 --> 34:00.137
He missed the city.

34:00.139 --> 34:02.897
But to me,

34:02.975 --> 34:04.875
it was like a dream.

34:13.909 --> 34:16.053
Well, let's go, then.

34:52.358 --> 34:53.507
This soldier's certainly
feeling better.

34:55.527 --> 34:58.362
No more coughing.

34:58.439 --> 35:00.955
It's a blessing
Major Bowen is in charge.

35:01.033 --> 35:02.357
He personally
made sure

35:02.434 --> 35:05.035
that everyone received
the best care.

35:05.037 --> 35:06.645
Yes.

35:06.722 --> 35:08.105
Very lucky.

35:22.571 --> 35:24.979
Do you mind bringing me
that Mercurochrome?

35:25.057 --> 35:29.226
Bandages
could use a change.

35:29.303 --> 35:31.319
Come on, you don't wanna
stand over there.

35:42.575 --> 35:45.742
You know, they wanted me
to switch barracks.

35:45.744 --> 35:46.743
Ha.

35:46.745 --> 35:48.395
Retreat now?

35:59.166 --> 36:01.075
I don't blame you, sweetheart.

36:02.928 --> 36:06.421
Men like that take advantage
of the vulnerable.

36:06.498 --> 36:07.998
I know at heart
you're a good girl.

36:09.359 --> 36:12.378
You could have sent him
to prison like you promised.

36:12.454 --> 36:16.364
He put his gun down
and surrendered.

36:16.442 --> 36:19.626
Here's the lesson...

36:19.703 --> 36:22.036
some dogs
you just have to put down.

36:22.114 --> 36:24.539
It's safer this way,

36:24.617 --> 36:26.283
trust me.

36:26.285 --> 36:28.802
Don't be so hard on yourself.

36:28.879 --> 36:30.938
He didn't leave you
any more choice than he left me.

36:48.015 --> 36:50.290
I knew you were
one of the good ones.

36:52.978 --> 36:55.379
I always trusted you.

38:14.243 --> 38:15.459
Abuela!

39:17.623 --> 39:18.713
Chester...

39:18.791 --> 39:20.640
You didn't have to,

39:20.717 --> 39:22.484
but I'm glad you did.

39:25.297 --> 39:29.649
So I was thinking
I'd keep driving east,

39:29.726 --> 39:31.743
see the country,

39:31.820 --> 39:32.986
maybe find a city

39:33.063 --> 39:35.831
where Taizo Tanabe
can find some decent work.

39:44.233 --> 39:45.966
Stay.

39:50.155 --> 39:51.179
Here?

39:53.008 --> 39:55.659
My family, um...

39:55.661 --> 39:58.729
There's a lot of work.

40:27.192 --> 40:28.842
Luz? Is that you?

40:40.305 --> 40:42.272
Who are you?

40:56.479 --> 40:59.313
Did Chester send you?

40:59.391 --> 41:01.124
What has he done
with my daughter?

41:07.399 --> 41:08.799
You need to leave.
