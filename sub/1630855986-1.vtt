WEBVTT

00:11.804 --> 00:13.151
[wind whistling softly]

00:17.776 --> 00:19.053
-The Carmichael Manor.

00:24.921 --> 00:26.543
Where to begin?

00:32.134 --> 00:33.309
The manor's history
is as sordid

00:33.412 --> 00:35.483
as the Carmichaels
themselves.

00:35.587 --> 00:40.902
You got this big mansion.
Rockland County, New York --

00:41.006 --> 00:43.146
a county with its own
sordid history.

00:43.250 --> 00:46.184
-The Carmichael Manor
was something that fascinated me

00:46.287 --> 00:48.876
as a true crime writer
for a long time.

00:48.979 --> 00:52.224
They were an extremely
wealthy family.

00:52.328 --> 00:55.158
I mean, their home was deep
in the woods,

00:55.262 --> 00:57.919
totally remote
from civilization.

00:58.023 --> 01:02.234
You had to drive literal miles
and miles down dirt roads

01:02.338 --> 01:03.891
just to get to it.

01:03.994 --> 01:06.514
And tragically,
one October morning,

01:06.618 --> 01:10.242
the police discovered Catherine
and Eleanor Carmichael

01:10.346 --> 01:15.489
both dead in their beds,
just horrifically murdered.

01:15.592 --> 01:19.769
-The obvious suspect is
the father, Arthur Carmichael.

01:19.872 --> 01:21.426
What's the problem
with that?

01:21.529 --> 01:25.292
Well, he and the 20-year-old
son, Patrick Carmichael,

01:25.395 --> 01:28.157
have been missing for
the last 30 years --

01:28.260 --> 01:30.607
like, completely vanished.

01:30.711 --> 01:34.059
-But I think they leaned heavily
on Arthur

01:34.163 --> 01:35.888
because there was early snow
that year,

01:35.991 --> 01:39.616
and there's only one set of
footprints leaving the house.

01:39.720 --> 01:40.893
Nothing coming in.

01:40.997 --> 01:43.241
-Most likely Arthur,

01:43.344 --> 01:45.726
since Patrick only had use
of one arm at the time

01:45.829 --> 01:47.140
after the car accident.

01:47.245 --> 01:49.384
Earlier that same year,

01:49.488 --> 01:52.215
Patrick and their
elder sister, Margaret,

01:52.319 --> 01:53.975
were involved in
a car crash,

01:54.079 --> 01:56.253
which tragically
killed Margaret.

01:56.357 --> 01:59.152
-Patrick was driving
Margaret home from the city

01:59.257 --> 02:02.777
when they were smashed
by a drunk driver.

02:02.881 --> 02:05.090
Patrick ends up
surviving the accident,

02:05.194 --> 02:08.231
just losing the use
of one arm.

02:08.335 --> 02:11.648
But Margaret was declared dead
at the scene.

02:16.515 --> 02:20.968
The decades-old murder was ripe
for Reddit conspiracies,

02:21.071 --> 02:23.384
Internet sleuth
speculation.

02:23.488 --> 02:26.836
The rumors that it was haunted
started very early on.

02:28.182 --> 02:30.115
[audio warbling]

02:30.219 --> 02:32.186
-Carmichael Manor is home to
a grizzly murder

02:32.290 --> 02:34.671
that occurred right upstairs
from where I stand

02:34.775 --> 02:36.397
just one year ago.

02:37.778 --> 02:39.745
Half the family murdered,

02:39.849 --> 02:43.611
while the other half is still
missing, and still no answers.

02:43.715 --> 02:44.819
[object bangs]

02:47.753 --> 02:49.272
-Poor Tom Wheeler.

02:49.376 --> 02:51.067
And he had to keep doing takes
after that.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.241
And you can see how
all he wanted to do

02:52.344 --> 02:53.552
was get the hell
out of there.

02:53.656 --> 02:56.037
Incidents like that
fueled

02:56.141 --> 02:58.143
the ghosts enthusiasts
over the years.

02:58.247 --> 03:00.594
But outside family,

03:00.697 --> 03:03.562
very few people were ever
granted permission

03:03.666 --> 03:06.013
to stay in the home for
an extended period of time --

03:06.116 --> 03:08.567
until Margot Bentley.

03:09.741 --> 03:11.950
-The last time that
I heard from Margot

03:12.053 --> 03:14.435
was the day she drove out to
the Carmichael Manor.

03:15.712 --> 03:18.922
Rebecca was with her.
She always was.

03:19.026 --> 03:22.098
Five days later,
I got a call

03:22.202 --> 03:24.514
from a New York State
Police detective.

03:24.618 --> 03:28.069
Their bodies had been found
in the manor.

03:28.173 --> 03:31.659
-The only known thing that
happened to Margot and Rebecca

03:31.763 --> 03:36.388
was the 911 call that police
received at around 2:00 a.m.

03:36.492 --> 03:38.942
And this was their fourth night
in the mansion.

03:40.910 --> 03:42.567
-Wait, wait. Wait.
It's working. It's working.

03:42.670 --> 03:44.776
Hi.
My name is Rebecca Vickers.

03:44.879 --> 03:47.261
We're Carmichael Manors,
at 101 Starlight Drive.

03:47.365 --> 03:48.297
Please, something's
in the house with us.

03:48.400 --> 03:49.850
Margot! It's not him!

03:51.472 --> 03:54.199
-Most keyboard detectives
stay in the comfort

03:54.303 --> 03:56.132
of their own home.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.410
That wasn't how Margot
did her work.

03:58.514 --> 04:00.826
She was always there,

04:00.930 --> 04:03.622
and she was always
recording everything.

04:04.313 --> 04:07.626
What's on their video
is four nights

04:07.730 --> 04:12.631
of completely perplexing and
unexplainable nights of footage.

04:12.735 --> 04:16.670
Whoever sees this, that's the
best disclaimer I can give.

04:16.773 --> 04:18.844
[Rebecca and Margot
shrieking]

04:44.042 --> 04:46.527
-How much further?
I'm kinda getting hungry.

04:47.321 --> 04:49.461
-I told you a banana
wasn't gonna be filling.

04:49.565 --> 04:50.704
-I'm not gonna make it.

04:50.807 --> 04:51.946
[laughs]
I'm not gonna make it.

04:52.050 --> 04:53.500
Let's stop and eat.

04:53.603 --> 04:55.364
-Okay. [sighs]
Where would you like to go?

04:55.467 --> 04:57.642
-I don't know.
Do you see a sign somewhere?

04:57.745 --> 04:59.264
I -- I would.

04:59.368 --> 05:00.230
I would slaughter a chicken
right now.

05:00.334 --> 05:01.715
-Okay.

05:01.818 --> 05:03.130
-I will do what I need to do
'cause --

05:03.233 --> 05:04.373
-Wow.
-I'm at that point right now.

05:04.476 --> 05:05.684
-Survival mode.

05:05.788 --> 05:07.514
-Spoons.
-Thank you for paying.

05:09.412 --> 05:11.656
-Why, uh,
what's the deal with the camera?

05:11.759 --> 05:13.416
-Oh,
I'm so happy you asked.

05:13.520 --> 05:14.624
Rebecca, will you hold this
for a second?

05:14.728 --> 05:17.006
-Oh, God.
-Thank you.

05:17.109 --> 05:18.663
So, actually,
we are here --

05:18.766 --> 05:20.320
are you okay with me on camera
for a few minutes?

05:20.423 --> 05:22.045
-Uh, what are we gonna
talk about?

05:22.149 --> 05:23.978
-So I actually created
a website.

05:24.082 --> 05:25.980
It's called
netsleuths.com.

05:26.084 --> 05:28.086
And we go investigate
these murder scenes.

05:28.189 --> 05:29.156
And I have a question
for you --

05:29.259 --> 05:30.537
-Oh, you're going to
the Carmichaels.

05:30.640 --> 05:31.814
-Yes! You knew it.
You knew it.

05:31.917 --> 05:33.643
Do you have any opinions
about it?

05:33.747 --> 05:36.612
-It's, uh, you know,
it's the local lore legend.

05:36.715 --> 05:37.716
Everybody knows the story
of that place.

05:37.820 --> 05:39.304
-Okay.

05:39.408 --> 05:40.581
-You know, that they got
butchered in the bed,

05:40.685 --> 05:41.962
or whatever the heck
it was.

05:42.065 --> 05:43.895
-Yes!
That's exactly it.

05:43.998 --> 05:45.068
-So, you're going to
check it out?

05:45.172 --> 05:46.553
-We're going to
check it out.

05:46.656 --> 05:48.348
We're gonna be there
for five days.

05:48.451 --> 05:49.349
-You're s-- no, you're staying
in the Carmichael?

05:49.452 --> 05:50.936
-We're staying inside.
-Yeah.

05:51.040 --> 05:52.800
-Yes. We got permission.
-Is that crazy?

05:52.904 --> 05:54.388
-Wow, okay, yeah,
we used to like, party,

05:54.492 --> 05:55.769
in their backyard and stuff,
'cause it's so remote --

05:55.872 --> 05:57.218
like,
back in high school,

05:57.322 --> 05:58.599
'cause no cops
would go out there-

05:58.703 --> 06:00.014
-But we've --
none of us have actually

06:00.118 --> 06:01.153
been inside of it.
-Wow.

06:03.673 --> 06:05.537
-All right, sleuthers.

06:05.641 --> 06:08.402
We are about 30 minutes
from our new home

06:08.506 --> 06:11.474
for the next five days --
the Carmichael Manor.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.615
Yep.

06:14.719 --> 06:16.582
And as you can tell,

06:16.686 --> 06:17.998
Rebecca is as excited,
as always, for a road trip.

06:18.101 --> 06:19.896
-Mm.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.209
I don't see why we can't stay at
a nearby hotel this time.

06:22.312 --> 06:23.486
I'm --
you can still do your work,

06:23.590 --> 06:24.832
and I can have
reliable Internet.

06:24.936 --> 06:26.800
-Yeah, but where's the fun
in that?

06:28.353 --> 06:29.423
And hey, this place
does have Internet.

06:29.527 --> 06:31.391
I promise.

06:31.494 --> 06:33.807
Do you want my tomato?
-It better, okay?

06:33.909 --> 06:35.740
Because I can't miss
a single meeting this week.

06:35.843 --> 06:37.051
-Oh, I know.

06:37.155 --> 06:38.501
You'll murder me, too,

06:38.605 --> 06:39.606
if you miss
your precious meetings.

06:39.709 --> 06:40.883
-[Grunts menacingly]

06:40.986 --> 06:42.125
-Stop that.

06:42.229 --> 06:43.472
[Rebecca chuckles]

06:43.575 --> 06:44.680
Will you grab the camera?
-Yeah.

06:48.442 --> 06:50.548
You ever been out
this way before?

06:50.651 --> 06:52.446
-Uh, to this specific area,
no.

06:52.550 --> 06:54.621
But I was in Rockland County
once as a kid.

06:55.622 --> 06:57.244
-Oh, is that the thing
with the...

06:57.347 --> 06:58.866
-Yeah.

07:02.836 --> 07:04.665
-Margot, how off-the-grid
is this place?

07:04.769 --> 07:06.702
We've been driving on a dirt
road for, like, 20 minutes now.

07:06.805 --> 07:08.600
-Yeah,
it's pretty remote.

07:08.704 --> 07:10.395
-Okay. Remote, right?

07:10.499 --> 07:12.155
-Yeah.
-So remote.

07:12.259 --> 07:13.709
And yet, it has Internet?
I'm starting to have doubts.

07:13.812 --> 07:16.021
So, this is what happens
when you have no signal

07:16.125 --> 07:18.507
and you don't know
how to read a map.

07:18.610 --> 07:19.853
Let's go see.

07:24.029 --> 07:25.582
Are you sure we're still in
North America?

07:25.686 --> 07:28.827
-Lemme just check
really quick.

07:28.931 --> 07:30.104
-Yeah, no, that's
North American dirt.

07:30.207 --> 07:31.416
-Oh, that's nice.
-Yeah.

07:31.520 --> 07:32.935
-That is...
-Really nice.

07:36.386 --> 07:38.872
-Damn.
How rich were the Carmichaels?

07:40.701 --> 07:42.013
And this is where
we're staying?

07:43.324 --> 07:44.705
-Can you believe it?

07:48.226 --> 07:50.504
-So, do we just knock?

07:50.608 --> 07:52.713
-Yeah. I guess so.

07:53.162 --> 07:54.266
Wait, wait, wait,
you do the filming,

07:54.370 --> 07:55.716
I'm gonna do the talking.

07:55.820 --> 07:56.959
-Yeah.

07:57.062 --> 07:58.926
Oh, yeah.

07:59.030 --> 08:00.894
Could definitely see a horrific
murder happening here.

08:00.997 --> 08:02.274
-Yeah, no kidding.

08:09.212 --> 08:10.524
Hello?

08:14.701 --> 08:16.392
-Margot.
Donald.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.773
We spoke on the phone
last week.

08:17.876 --> 08:19.326
-Yes.
So nice to meet you in person.

08:19.429 --> 08:20.638
-Nice to meet you,
as well.

08:20.741 --> 08:22.191
-This is my girlfriend,
Rebecca.

08:22.294 --> 08:23.710
She's gonna be keeping me
company on this journey.

08:23.813 --> 08:25.194
-Great. I am very sorry.
I did not hear you pull in.

08:25.297 --> 08:27.230
I have been trying to get things
ready in here.

08:27.334 --> 08:29.094
-Also, are you okay with being
on camera for a few minutes?

08:29.198 --> 08:31.338
-That's fine.

08:31.441 --> 08:33.857
Oh, this.

08:33.961 --> 08:36.963
That is
the family portrait.

08:37.068 --> 08:40.140
Eleanor had that commissioned
one year

08:40.243 --> 08:46.077
before Margaret's death in the,
um, car accident.

08:46.180 --> 08:48.355
Normally, we have a third party
come in,

08:48.458 --> 08:50.978
and turn the place around
for us.

08:51.082 --> 08:52.359
But we've had
a bit of a hard time

08:52.462 --> 08:54.361
getting companies to come out
this far.

08:54.464 --> 08:56.397
The house
is pretty remote,

08:56.501 --> 08:59.297
and, of course by now,
everyone knows.

08:59.400 --> 09:01.782
-Knows what?

09:01.886 --> 09:03.819
-Do members of the family
still use it?

09:03.922 --> 09:06.373
-Well, it's still in
the Carmichael family name.

09:06.476 --> 09:08.858
It went to
Eleanor's family first,

09:08.962 --> 09:11.343
after everything
happened.

09:11.447 --> 09:14.174
More recently,
her sister Beatrice.

09:14.277 --> 09:16.245
Now, Beatrice is 83,

09:16.348 --> 09:19.144
so, we basically look after
the whole estate for her.

09:19.248 --> 09:22.320
I am sorry, by the way,
about all the time constraints.

09:22.423 --> 09:25.219
Some of our estate overseers
just want this place

09:25.323 --> 09:27.221
to be completely closed off
to the public.

09:27.325 --> 09:29.845
Liability concerns.

09:29.948 --> 09:32.813
Right now, short-term stays
are the middle ground.

09:32.917 --> 09:34.643
You guys.

09:34.746 --> 09:36.058
-Thank you so much
for getting everyone to agree.

09:36.161 --> 09:37.300
Five days is plenty.

09:37.404 --> 09:38.612
-[Chuckles]

09:38.716 --> 09:40.303
Well, I told them
to give you 10 days.

09:40.407 --> 09:42.271
I mean, truthfully,
you could have 20 if you wanted.

09:42.374 --> 09:45.619
Really, nobody stays here
more than a few nights.

09:45.723 --> 09:47.034
-Oh God,
Is it because of the Internet?

09:47.138 --> 09:48.311
Please don't say
it's the Internet.

09:48.415 --> 09:50.141
-No.

09:50.244 --> 09:54.040
As I told Margot on the phone,
that is reliable.

09:54.145 --> 09:55.456
-I told you so.

09:55.560 --> 09:57.113
-What's this.

09:57.217 --> 09:58.667
-On the wall?

09:58.770 --> 10:00.082
You can't hear anything,
but back in the day,

10:00.185 --> 10:01.773
that would actually buzz
the kitchen,

10:01.877 --> 10:03.672
when there was a full-time staff
working here.

10:03.775 --> 10:04.776
-Very "Downton Abbey."

10:04.880 --> 10:06.606
[Donald laughs]

10:06.709 --> 10:07.676
-Of course, you'll have
everything you need --

10:07.779 --> 10:09.574
linens, food.

10:09.678 --> 10:10.644
Which one of you
likes coffee?

10:10.748 --> 10:12.128
-Oh, me.
-I do.

10:12.232 --> 10:13.543
-[Laughs] Good.
'Cause we have plenty.

10:13.647 --> 10:15.235
[Margot chuckles]

10:15.338 --> 10:17.030
Believe it or not,

10:17.133 --> 10:18.548
the entire house is pretty much
exactly as it was

10:18.652 --> 10:20.654
in October of '89.

10:20.758 --> 10:22.898
Nobody's really lived here
full-time since then.

10:26.211 --> 10:29.180
This was Catherine's
bedroom --

10:29.283 --> 10:33.253
Arthur Carmichael's
youngest daughter.

10:33.356 --> 10:36.670
She was only 17
when the whole thing happened.

10:36.774 --> 10:39.984
Apparently, she wanted to be
a filmmaker.

10:40.087 --> 10:43.228
It was said that she was always
filming around the house,

10:43.332 --> 10:47.198
capturing home movies
of some kind or another.

10:47.301 --> 10:49.165
She might have had a future
in that.

10:49.269 --> 10:50.960
-Reports say her murder
was brutal, right?

10:51.064 --> 10:53.618
Like, it had to be
a crime of rage.

10:53.722 --> 10:55.413
-[Sighs] And personal.

10:55.516 --> 10:57.035
I consider myself lucky

10:57.139 --> 11:00.142
I didn't see
the crime scene photos.

11:00.245 --> 11:02.109
I can't even imagine
what happened in here.

11:09.392 --> 11:14.674
This is the master bedroom,
largest room we have.

11:14.777 --> 11:17.262
-So, Arthur and Eleanor
slept in here?

11:17.366 --> 11:19.126
-Yes.

11:19.230 --> 11:21.197
-Can I ask you
a personal question?

11:21.301 --> 11:22.820
-Of course.

11:22.923 --> 11:23.993
-Do you think Arthur
did it?

11:25.892 --> 11:28.757
What's in here?

11:28.860 --> 11:33.796
-Uh, that is old storage.

11:33.900 --> 11:35.695
Truthfully, I haven't been
in there in years.

11:35.798 --> 11:38.283
I don't even have a key for it
anymore.

11:38.387 --> 11:41.217
This is Patrick's
bedroom.

11:41.321 --> 11:45.877
Sadly, they never found
Patrick's body.

11:45.981 --> 11:47.603
Suffered a broken arm
in the car accident

11:47.707 --> 11:48.915
that killed Margaret.

11:50.399 --> 11:54.679
Apparently, he was very
traumatized by her death.

11:54.783 --> 11:57.820
They were driving home
from the city,

11:57.924 --> 12:00.340
hit by a truckload
of town drunks.

12:00.443 --> 12:01.928
-I can't even imagine.

12:05.414 --> 12:08.831
-Our offices are 15 minutes
away, so don't hesitate to call.

12:08.935 --> 12:10.522
We can usually get here
pretty quick.

12:10.626 --> 12:12.283
-Thank you very much.

12:12.386 --> 12:16.114
-Are you familiar with
the Abaddon Hotel a town over?

12:16.218 --> 12:17.598
-Yeah.

12:17.702 --> 12:18.772
It burned to the ground
a few years ago.

12:18.876 --> 12:19.980
-Well, yes,
it's an empty field now,

12:20.084 --> 12:22.120
but there is
an antique store

12:22.224 --> 12:24.122
that recovered quite a few
of the items.

12:24.226 --> 12:25.572
Given the work
that you're doing,

12:25.675 --> 12:27.229
I thought that might
interest you.

12:27.332 --> 12:29.472
-Ooh, definitely interested in
the antique store.

12:29.576 --> 12:30.819
-Call if you
need anything.

12:30.922 --> 12:33.511
-Thanks again.

12:33.614 --> 12:35.237
Well?

12:35.340 --> 12:36.894
-Seems nice.

12:36.997 --> 12:38.688
I mean, my company
would definitely buy it

12:38.792 --> 12:41.761
if it weren't so huge.

12:41.864 --> 12:43.314
What?

12:43.417 --> 12:46.455
-So, Chase is gonna be here
in an hour.

12:46.558 --> 12:48.077
-[sighs]

12:48.181 --> 12:49.699
-Okay, yeah, no,
don't gimme that, please.

12:49.803 --> 12:51.011
I think it's gonna
be great.

12:51.115 --> 12:52.185
He's gonna be
an extra hand.

12:52.288 --> 12:53.807
-Margot, he's not an extra set
of hands.

12:53.911 --> 12:55.257
He's a liability.

12:55.360 --> 12:56.914
Listen, I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry.

12:57.017 --> 12:58.501
I love him, too,
but he is.

12:58.605 --> 13:00.158
-I know.

13:00.262 --> 13:01.642
But I think he's got
his shit together,

13:01.746 --> 13:02.643
and just give him
a chance, okay?

13:02.747 --> 13:03.990
-Margot...

13:04.093 --> 13:05.370
Can I shut this thing
off now?

13:05.474 --> 13:06.578
-Yeah.

13:11.445 --> 13:12.964
-I'm not gonna lie,

13:13.068 --> 13:15.553
this is not -- not as bad
as I thought it would be.

13:15.656 --> 13:17.935
-I told you so.

13:19.764 --> 13:21.248
-Margot.

13:23.457 --> 13:25.494
Oh. Hey.

13:27.945 --> 13:29.256
You got it open?

13:31.811 --> 13:36.367
Are we even allowed
to be in there, or...?

13:36.470 --> 13:37.920
Okay.

13:42.891 --> 13:46.342
What is all this?

13:46.446 --> 13:47.619
-I don't know.

13:55.386 --> 14:00.046
-Well, I could see why
they would keep it locked.

14:00.149 --> 14:02.980
We should do the same.

14:03.083 --> 14:05.499
-Hello? Margot?

14:05.603 --> 14:07.777
-Hey, he's here.

14:07.881 --> 14:09.400
[floor creaking]

14:16.648 --> 14:18.409
-Hey.
Where are you guys?

14:18.512 --> 14:19.617
-Chase?

14:19.720 --> 14:21.481
-Hey.
-Hey. Hi.

14:21.584 --> 14:23.138
-Hi.
-Oh, my God.

14:23.241 --> 14:24.725
-I missed you.
-I missed you!

14:24.829 --> 14:26.106
-You started already, huh?

14:26.210 --> 14:27.625
-Yeah.
-This is how it's done?

14:27.728 --> 14:28.798
-This is how
it's done.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.386
-Wow.
-Oh, my God. Hi.

14:30.490 --> 14:31.974
Your face. How are you?
Good? Yeah?

14:32.078 --> 14:33.424
You seeing someone?
You got here safe?

14:33.527 --> 14:34.908
Everything good with that?
-Here we go.

14:35.012 --> 14:36.185
I'm fine, all right?

14:36.289 --> 14:38.360
And I am seeing somebody.

14:38.463 --> 14:40.293
Hey, Scorsese.
How are you doing?

14:40.396 --> 14:41.915
-Hey, Chase.
How you doing?

14:42.019 --> 14:43.952
-Did you just say
you're seeing somebody.

14:44.055 --> 14:45.850
-She's making you film
every conversation?

14:45.954 --> 14:47.438
-Yep. Pretty much.
-Wow.

14:47.540 --> 14:49.509
-Oh, I'm still here.
What, y-you're seeing somebody?

14:49.612 --> 14:52.236
-I'm sure this is gonna make for
some great TV someday.

14:52.339 --> 14:54.031
-Don't --
Don't walk away from me.

14:54.134 --> 14:55.790
Are you getting married
tomorrow?

14:55.895 --> 14:56.965
What's -- What's her name?
Is she -- Is she beautiful?

14:57.068 --> 14:58.863
-Cut it out!

14:58.967 --> 15:00.969
-When you look back
at Margot's history,

15:01.072 --> 15:03.937
you can see where she grew
her own passion

15:04.041 --> 15:05.801
for solving
cold cases.

15:05.905 --> 15:10.150
I mean, what happened to her
at a county fair as a child,

15:10.254 --> 15:12.773
that would leave a mark
on anyone.

15:12.877 --> 15:15.052
-When Margot was
about 10,

15:15.155 --> 15:18.987
her family took her and Chase
to the county fair.

15:19.090 --> 15:21.748
She got separated
from them somehow,

15:21.851 --> 15:23.267
and a man
she didn't know

15:23.370 --> 15:27.133
tried to lure her away
from the fairgrounds.

15:27.236 --> 15:29.929
It took her a little while
to realize something was wrong,

15:30.032 --> 15:31.723
and she started
to scream.

15:31.827 --> 15:33.829
The guy ran off.

15:33.933 --> 15:38.420
She couldn't help her parents
or the police identify him.

15:38.523 --> 15:42.010
-I think, as she got older,
it really must have sunk in

15:42.113 --> 15:44.426
that she could have died
that day,

15:44.529 --> 15:47.394
because several others went
missing from that same fair,

15:47.498 --> 15:50.535
and they were never seen again
over the years.

15:50.639 --> 15:56.300
I think, in some ways,
she felt partially responsible.

15:56.403 --> 15:58.819
-In college, she and I
envisioned the website

15:58.923 --> 16:00.994
that would become
Net Sleuths.

16:01.098 --> 16:02.996
And, over the years,

16:03.100 --> 16:05.481
we developed it into
a pretty significant community

16:05.585 --> 16:10.693
of Internet detectives focused
on solving the unsolved.

16:10.797 --> 16:13.593
Margot always had to take things
a step further.

16:13.696 --> 16:17.045
She began this routine
of staying in the places

16:17.148 --> 16:18.736
where she was
investigating,

16:18.839 --> 16:21.670
taking a ton of photos
and video.

16:21.773 --> 16:25.501
[subdued music]

16:25.605 --> 16:30.368
Her last investigation ended up
being the Carmichael Manor.

16:30.472 --> 16:33.440
-It's alleged that,
on October 10th, 1989,

16:33.544 --> 16:36.409
Arthur killed his wife,
daughter, and son

16:36.512 --> 16:40.206
during the night,
just brutally stabbing them.

16:40.309 --> 16:43.174
And then, he leaves the manor
with Patrick,

16:43.278 --> 16:47.075
dumping his body
in some unknown location.

16:47.178 --> 16:51.286
And then, Arthur just
completely disappears.

16:55.945 --> 16:57.188
-What makes him
the main suspect?

16:57.292 --> 16:59.328
-Because there was no
forced entry.

16:59.432 --> 17:01.399
And there was also early snow
that year,

17:01.503 --> 17:04.367
so it was very easy for
the police to see a single set

17:04.471 --> 17:07.785
of footprints leaving the house
and going into the woods.

17:07.887 --> 17:09.406
-What about Patrick?

17:09.511 --> 17:11.133
-So, his body
was never found,

17:11.237 --> 17:13.272
but there was blood
all over his bed,

17:13.377 --> 17:16.104
so the police think that he may
have been Arthur's first victim,

17:16.207 --> 17:17.726
killing him first,

17:17.829 --> 17:21.626
then Catherine, and then
Eleanor, stabbing them.

17:23.663 --> 17:25.319
-Oh, my God.

17:25.423 --> 17:27.287
And Catherine,
she was killed in our room?

17:27.391 --> 17:28.978
Mm, can we switch
with Chase?

17:29.082 --> 17:31.188
-Okay, so,
theoretically,

17:31.291 --> 17:34.432
Arthur Carmichael
walks down these stairs,

17:34.536 --> 17:37.021
and he's covered in blood, and
wouldn't have time to change.

17:37.125 --> 17:38.505
So -- hold on, Chase.
Move.

17:38.609 --> 17:40.059
Okay.

17:40.162 --> 17:42.992
He walks down this way,
to the left,

17:43.096 --> 17:44.994
right outside
these doors.

17:45.098 --> 17:47.549
But no, he's gone.

17:47.652 --> 17:50.138
Just vanishes.
Not a drop of blood anywhere.

17:50.241 --> 17:52.209
Not even in the snow.

17:52.312 --> 17:54.797
-But, okay,
what about Patrick's body?

17:54.901 --> 17:57.145
Was he carrying it?
Or how is that explained?

17:57.248 --> 17:58.870
-Oh, it's not.

17:58.974 --> 18:01.252
-What do you want
from me?

18:01.356 --> 18:03.012
I mean, I --
don't get me wrong,

18:03.116 --> 18:05.187
I'm --
I'm glad you called.

18:05.291 --> 18:07.707
I'm just, I'm not much of a --
a sloth.

18:07.810 --> 18:11.642
[Rebecca and Margot laugh]

18:11.745 --> 18:14.576
-No, Chase. No.
-What?

18:14.679 --> 18:19.374
-It's -- I'm sorry.
-It's sleuth.

18:19.477 --> 18:21.272
-I'm not much of
a sleuth.

18:21.376 --> 18:24.413
-So, I need at least two cameras
filming at all times.

18:24.517 --> 18:26.035
Thank you.

18:26.139 --> 18:27.244
Even the most
mundane stuff,

18:27.347 --> 18:28.521
not even relating to
the investigation.

18:28.624 --> 18:30.281
-Margot thinks,
of all the places

18:30.385 --> 18:31.558
that we've been to that
are supposedly haunted,

18:31.662 --> 18:33.974
this one's actually for real
this time.

18:34.078 --> 18:35.631
[chuckles]

18:35.735 --> 18:37.323
[phone chimes]

18:37.426 --> 18:38.669
Oh.

18:38.772 --> 18:41.465
Shoot,
I gotta get this.

18:41.568 --> 18:42.811
Hi. Linda.

18:42.914 --> 18:44.330
Can you --
Can you hear me?

18:44.433 --> 18:45.779
I...

18:48.057 --> 18:49.473
Linda, can you...?

18:49.576 --> 18:51.785
Aw, dammit.

18:51.889 --> 18:55.582
-All right, sleuthers,
this is our first official night

18:55.686 --> 19:00.587
at the Carmichael Manor,
Manor, Manor, Manor.

19:00.691 --> 19:05.316
And everyone seems to be
settling in.

19:05.420 --> 19:06.628
How's it going?

19:06.731 --> 19:07.870
-Hey.

19:07.974 --> 19:09.424
Sorry.

19:09.527 --> 19:11.150
I'll -- I'll be more help
in the morning.

19:11.253 --> 19:13.048
Before we left,
my job sent all these listings

19:13.152 --> 19:14.429
for me to sort
before my presentation.

19:14.532 --> 19:17.501
But thank God the Internet
does work, though.

19:17.604 --> 19:19.399
-Hey,
I totally get it.

19:19.503 --> 19:22.195
New job,
new responsibilities.

19:22.299 --> 19:24.611
But hey, seriously,
I'm just very thankful

19:24.715 --> 19:26.544
that you came with me at all
this time.

19:26.648 --> 19:28.719
So, thank you.

19:28.822 --> 19:31.342
-Listen, about that.

19:31.446 --> 19:34.103
You know I love going on
these adventures with you,

19:34.207 --> 19:35.726
cracking old mysteries.

19:35.829 --> 19:37.762
Truly, I -- I love it.

19:37.866 --> 19:40.903
-I feel like there's a "but"
coming, here.

19:41.007 --> 19:42.974
-This is probably gonna be
one of the last times

19:43.078 --> 19:46.461
I'm able to go with you --
at least for a little while.

19:46.564 --> 19:49.498
I really like this job,
and I need it to stick.

19:49.602 --> 19:53.640
And going to old murder houses,
I...

19:53.744 --> 19:54.952
[sighs]

19:57.403 --> 19:59.370
Can you turn that thing off
for a second?

20:05.169 --> 20:06.653
-Hey.

20:06.757 --> 20:08.137
-Hey.

20:08.241 --> 20:10.105
Thank you for
the big room.

20:10.209 --> 20:13.281
This is -- well, probably the
nicest room I've ever slept in.

20:13.384 --> 20:15.075
I thought you'd have me
in the attic or something.

20:15.179 --> 20:17.699
-Oh, I --
I haven't ruled that out.

20:17.802 --> 20:19.770
Where's your, uh, what --
what's it called again?

20:19.873 --> 20:23.049
A -- A camera?
-Tomorrow, I promise.

20:23.152 --> 20:24.637
I won't ever put it down.

20:24.740 --> 20:26.397
I will take it with me
to the bathroom.

20:26.501 --> 20:27.743
-[laughs]
Okay, okay.

20:27.847 --> 20:29.366
I'm just saying.

20:29.469 --> 20:32.610
-Do you actually think
this place is haunted?

20:32.714 --> 20:34.094
-I don't know.

20:34.198 --> 20:37.615
But if it is,
please get it on camera.

20:37.719 --> 20:39.376
-[Sighs]

20:39.479 --> 20:40.687
Yeah, but none of the places
that you've --

20:40.791 --> 20:42.689
you've been to before
were actually haunted?

20:42.793 --> 20:44.070
-[Chuckles] No.

20:44.173 --> 20:46.693
-So why call me now?

20:46.797 --> 20:48.902
-What do you want me to say,
here, Chase?

20:49.006 --> 20:51.974
-That -- That --
That mom called,

20:52.078 --> 20:53.666
and told you
I had an incident,

20:53.769 --> 20:55.046
and -- and you thought that
this would be the best way

20:55.150 --> 20:56.358
to keep an eye on me.

20:56.462 --> 20:58.049
-And what if
that's true?

20:58.153 --> 20:59.844
Is that so bad?

20:59.948 --> 21:01.846
You get to help me.
Now I get to help you, too.

21:01.950 --> 21:05.540
-I -- I don't need help, Margot.
-Oh, you don't?

21:05.643 --> 21:08.059
Because last I heard,
you went missing for two days,

21:08.163 --> 21:09.406
and nobody knew
where you went.

21:09.509 --> 21:12.063
-That's -- [chuckles] --
that's not what happened.

21:12.167 --> 21:14.273
-[Sighs]

21:14.376 --> 21:15.688
-It's not.

21:20.417 --> 21:21.659
[Wind whistling]

21:21.763 --> 21:23.005
-What was that?

21:28.045 --> 21:29.357
Rebecca?

21:32.774 --> 21:33.775
Hey.
-Jesus.

21:33.878 --> 21:35.155
-What's going on?

21:35.259 --> 21:36.605
-Did you hear it?
-I don't know.

21:36.709 --> 21:38.020
What did you hear?
-It-it-it sounded like --

21:38.124 --> 21:39.712
-Like what?

21:39.815 --> 21:41.230
-It sounded like someone
was singing downstairs,

21:41.334 --> 21:44.579
-Singing?
-Like a girl was singing.

21:44.682 --> 21:45.959
Hey.
Where -- Where are you going?

21:52.069 --> 21:53.795
-Did you get it
on camera?

21:53.898 --> 21:55.314
-Um, I don't think I recorded
in time, but at least I tried.

21:55.417 --> 21:57.350
-[Sighs]

21:57.454 --> 21:59.007
[wind continues whistling]

22:11.468 --> 22:13.159
Hey.
-Yeah?

22:13.262 --> 22:14.367
-Thanks for using
the camera.

22:14.471 --> 22:15.886
-You got it.

22:24.757 --> 22:26.034
Okay.

22:26.137 --> 22:28.208
Hey, sleuthers.
[chuckles]

22:28.312 --> 22:30.314
Sorry, I can't take
that seriously.

22:30.418 --> 22:32.730
Okay, so, last night
was the last night

22:32.834 --> 22:34.732
I'm staying on
these sheets.

22:34.836 --> 22:36.493
I got some new ones
yesterday.

22:36.596 --> 22:39.116
The old ones had, like,
a weird odor to them.

22:39.219 --> 22:41.567
And Margot, since you want me
to film everything,

22:41.670 --> 22:43.914
you're gonna get
all of this.

22:44.017 --> 22:46.399
We have not yet invented
a better way

22:46.503 --> 22:50.817
of figuring out which corner
goes where.

22:50.921 --> 22:55.822
She is conveniently absent
when I have to make the bed.

22:55.926 --> 22:57.272
All right.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.447
There you go, Margot.

22:59.550 --> 23:03.071
See that?
It wasn't so hard.

23:03.174 --> 23:05.280
Nice and clean.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.040
You can thank me later.

23:15.152 --> 23:18.224
Figure, if this is gonna be
our last adventure together,

23:18.327 --> 23:20.847
may as well have fresh sheets,
right?

23:20.951 --> 23:22.090
Mwah.

23:22.193 --> 23:25.300
Love you.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.164
-Like, I slept like a baby,
though, right through the night.

23:27.267 --> 23:28.545
What time was it?

23:28.648 --> 23:29.649
-Good morning,
my little sleuths.

23:29.753 --> 23:31.410
-Hey.
-Good morning.

23:31.513 --> 23:33.273
-Do you wanna go to
that antique store today?

23:33.377 --> 23:35.137
You know, we could get lucky
with some really good clues.

23:35.241 --> 23:36.518
And then, on the way,
you know,

23:36.622 --> 23:37.795
we might find
the perfect wooden bench --

23:37.899 --> 23:40.108
-For the foot of our bed!
There it is.

23:40.211 --> 23:41.661
-What should I do?

23:41.765 --> 23:43.007
-Oh, you should definitely
just stay here.

23:43.111 --> 23:44.181
Please film.
-That's it?

23:44.284 --> 23:45.493
You don't need me
to do anything?

23:45.596 --> 23:47.391
-No. That's it.

23:47.495 --> 23:49.082
-I guess I will
hang out here,

23:49.186 --> 23:51.809
and, uh, let you know
if I see any ghosts.

23:51.913 --> 23:53.224
-Thank you.

23:53.328 --> 23:54.571
Oh, hey,
you might get lucky.

23:54.674 --> 23:56.849
You might get breakfast
and a show,

23:56.952 --> 23:59.679
because, according to Rebecca,
they love to sing.

23:59.783 --> 24:01.232
-[Chase chuckles]
-Mm. No.

24:01.336 --> 24:03.614
I said it sounded
like singing.

24:03.718 --> 24:05.098
I didn't say it was
actually singing.

24:37.614 --> 24:39.581
[Margot sighs]

24:52.283 --> 24:53.871
[Margo exhales shakily]

24:57.875 --> 24:59.118
-Hey.

24:59.221 --> 25:00.671
Thought we
were leaving.

25:03.363 --> 25:04.848
God,
what is all this?

25:07.333 --> 25:09.300
Yep.

25:09.404 --> 25:12.234
Giving creepy
carny vibes.

25:15.686 --> 25:17.170
Hey. You okay?

25:17.274 --> 25:18.413
-Yeah.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.173
I'm fine.

25:20.277 --> 25:21.658
-We should get
on the road.

25:26.697 --> 25:28.147
[Knocking]

25:28.250 --> 25:29.424
-Chase?
-Hey.

25:29.528 --> 25:30.874
-Hey.

25:30.977 --> 25:32.496
-This place
is incredible.

25:32.600 --> 25:33.911
I feel like
I'm on vacation.

25:34.015 --> 25:35.948
-So, Rebecca and I
were gonna go antiquing.

25:36.051 --> 25:37.501
I just wanna make sure
you're all good,

25:37.605 --> 25:38.882
that you're gonna be good
by yourself.

25:38.985 --> 25:40.228
-[Chuckles]

25:40.331 --> 25:42.195
I'm fine.

25:42.299 --> 25:44.888
I -- I will keep an eye on
the place for you, all right?

25:50.790 --> 25:54.276
What?
-Where's your camera?

25:54.380 --> 25:55.899
-It's right there.

25:56.002 --> 25:57.486
-And we're here for
five days,

25:57.590 --> 25:59.040
so please don't be shy
with the camera, okay?

25:59.143 --> 26:00.351
-All right.

26:00.455 --> 26:02.077
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

26:02.181 --> 26:03.562
-All right.
See you in a few hours.

26:03.665 --> 26:05.046
-Have fun.
-Thank you.

26:07.945 --> 26:10.396
-Oh, you wanted footage,
Margot,

26:10.499 --> 26:13.572
you're gonna get
some footage.

26:16.367 --> 26:17.714
Boo!

26:17.817 --> 26:24.168
Margot, my dear,
I've solved your murders.

26:24.272 --> 26:26.723
Turns out there were no murders
at all.

26:29.691 --> 26:32.936
The Carmichaels
are alive and well.

26:33.039 --> 26:36.802
They faked their own death
as a tax evasion scheme.

26:36.905 --> 26:38.355
Ooh!

26:39.943 --> 26:44.499
It's me,
Arthur Carmichael.

26:44.603 --> 26:48.192
You brought this upon yourself,
Margot.

26:48.296 --> 26:55.510
You are gonna get a day
in the life of...

26:55.614 --> 26:56.891
[Chase spits]

26:59.272 --> 27:00.895
[Thuds]

27:06.625 --> 27:08.005
Margot?

27:11.422 --> 27:12.907
Rebecca?

27:16.255 --> 27:17.290
[Thuds]

27:31.753 --> 27:33.237
Are you guys --
Are you guys home?

27:36.447 --> 27:37.897
Margot?

27:39.519 --> 27:40.900
[Thudding]

28:01.749 --> 28:04.130
Margot.

28:04.234 --> 28:06.408
Come on, you guys better not
be fucking with me.

28:10.758 --> 28:12.138
[Floorboards creaking]

28:15.521 --> 28:17.350
Rebecca.

28:17.454 --> 28:19.594
Come on.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.251
[Creaking continues]

28:25.600 --> 28:27.360
Hello?

28:29.328 --> 28:30.294
Say something.

28:30.398 --> 28:32.193
Hello?

28:35.196 --> 28:36.853
All right, all right,
all right.

28:50.625 --> 28:58.702
[soft brooding music]

28:58.806 --> 29:02.499
All right, motherfucker.

29:02.602 --> 29:05.053
[dramatic music]

29:05.157 --> 29:08.643
[Chase breathing shakily]

29:08.747 --> 29:13.510
[Soft brooding music]

29:13.613 --> 29:15.546
Oh, come on.

29:23.278 --> 29:24.866
-Wow.
-So cute.

29:24.970 --> 29:26.419
-Those are very cute.

29:26.523 --> 29:30.216
-Oh, my god.
-What?

29:30.320 --> 29:31.700
-The perfect wooden bench
for the end of our bed.

29:31.804 --> 29:34.013
-Oh! There it is.

29:34.117 --> 29:36.602
-It's a little small, but...
-A little small.

29:36.705 --> 29:38.190
-Margot.
-What?

29:38.293 --> 29:40.917
-Oh, look at this.
-Yeah. Wow.

29:45.576 --> 29:46.508
-You from outta town?
-Oh!

29:46.612 --> 29:48.234
God. Yes. Sorry.

29:48.338 --> 29:49.339
[All chuckling]

29:49.442 --> 29:50.858
Yes. No.

29:50.961 --> 29:52.031
Yeah, we're in town
for the week.

29:52.135 --> 29:54.102
Um, what's --
what's all this, here?

29:54.206 --> 29:56.208
-Those are all the things found
at the Abaddon Hotel

29:56.311 --> 29:58.520
before it burned
to the ground.

29:58.624 --> 30:02.110
-I often wonder if anything
would've turned out differently

30:02.214 --> 30:04.285
if Margot and Rebecca
hadn't wandered into

30:04.388 --> 30:05.976
that antique shop.

30:06.080 --> 30:07.875
They find all this junk
from the Abaddon Hotel.

30:07.978 --> 30:09.324
Nothing that big of
a deal.

30:09.428 --> 30:11.982
And then,
Rebecca notices something

30:12.086 --> 30:16.021
about that clock,
and everything changes.

30:16.124 --> 30:18.989
-It has compartments.
-What?

30:19.093 --> 30:21.302
-It has compartments.
It has secret compartments.

30:21.405 --> 30:22.786
-How do you know that?

30:22.890 --> 30:25.030
-That's an old German
manufacturer.

30:25.133 --> 30:27.342
One of the listings has
the same clock that I have.

30:27.446 --> 30:30.069
Built all the clocks
the same way.

30:30.173 --> 30:31.450
-Why are you
whispering?

30:31.553 --> 30:33.348
-It's secret.

30:33.452 --> 30:34.936
-Okay.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.253
Holy shit.

30:42.979 --> 30:46.016
Oh, my God.

30:46.120 --> 30:47.673
Wow.

30:47.776 --> 30:48.950
Okay, keep going.
Keep going.

30:52.436 --> 30:53.990
Okay. Yep.

30:59.754 --> 31:01.307
-Oh. We can't take that!

31:01.411 --> 31:02.653
-Yes, we can.

31:04.759 --> 31:06.623
-Look at this.

31:06.726 --> 31:10.523
"All staff must be present
Thursday, September 15th.

31:10.627 --> 31:12.594
Hotel will be closed.

He wants Beverly found, and
safely brought back to hotel,

31:16.046 --> 31:17.703
of fear she might
be pregnant"?

31:17.806 --> 31:19.808
"Please handle
with caution."

31:19.912 --> 31:21.293
-Who the fuck
is Beverly?

31:21.396 --> 31:22.915
What?

31:23.019 --> 31:24.710
Okay, yep.
We're taking all of it.

31:24.813 --> 31:26.056
-Oh.
We can't take everything.

31:26.160 --> 31:28.196
-Yes, we can.
Nobody knows it exists.

31:32.649 --> 31:33.995
-Hey, you guys back?

31:36.825 --> 31:39.794

31:39.898 --> 31:42.486
Hey, guys,
are you here?

[chuckles]

31:44.005 --> 31:47.560
And of course,
the fucking power's out.

Hello?

31:49.700 --> 31:51.357
[chuckles nervously]

31:51.461 --> 31:52.669

32:07.166 --> 32:08.927
The fuck is that?

32:13.000 --> 32:16.520
Oh, shit.
What the fuck?

32:16.624 --> 32:18.143
Oh.

32:18.246 --> 32:20.421
Hello?

32:20.524 --> 32:21.732
Who is that?

33:04.016 --> 33:05.466
Say something.

33:15.717 --> 33:17.202
Fucking shit.

33:21.447 --> 33:23.346
Here we go.

breathing shakily]

[tense music]

33:30.905 --> 33:32.182
Who's in here?

33:34.219 --> 33:35.565
-Hey, we're back.

33:39.879 --> 33:41.571
You okay?

33:41.674 --> 33:42.917
-Did the power
go out?

33:43.021 --> 33:44.539
-Yeah, um...

33:44.643 --> 33:46.817
yeah, I, um...

33:46.921 --> 33:48.336
sorry.

33:48.440 --> 33:50.476
Um, can --
can I talk to you guys?

33:50.580 --> 33:51.788
-Yeah.

33:51.891 --> 33:53.652
[Chase sighs]

33:53.755 --> 33:56.068
-Boom. Right there.

33:56.172 --> 33:58.174
-Oh, my God.
You can see a face.

33:58.277 --> 33:59.968
-Are you sure
you were alone?

34:00.072 --> 34:01.556
-Who else
would be here?

34:01.660 --> 34:03.075
I mean,
down here and upstairs?

34:03.179 --> 34:06.906
-You might be right
about this place.

34:07.010 --> 34:09.047
It might actually
be real.

34:09.150 --> 34:11.808
[subdued music]

34:11.911 --> 34:13.188
-I mean, I --
-Don't.

34:13.292 --> 34:16.916
Don't say
"I told you so."

34:17.020 --> 34:20.161
-I've always had my suspicions
that there was something more

34:20.264 --> 34:22.370
behind her going to
the Carmichael Manor --

34:22.474 --> 34:25.614
like she was after a bigger
piece to a bigger puzzle,

34:25.717 --> 34:29.067
which had eluded people
for years.

34:29.170 --> 34:31.621
But she definitely
found it.

34:31.724 --> 34:33.485
-The film canister
that they found

34:33.588 --> 34:36.384
inside that old clock
from the Abaddon,

34:36.487 --> 34:41.217
that something so game-changing
was in there

34:41.320 --> 34:44.289
the whole time,
while "Hell House" was there,

34:44.391 --> 34:48.120
"Insomnia," and --
and everyone else, just --

34:48.224 --> 34:52.297
just waiting for someone
to open it, and find it.

34:52.400 --> 34:57.957
Over 30 years later,
somebody did.

34:58.061 --> 34:59.442
-I thought I would see
some footage

34:59.545 --> 35:01.133
of the Abaddon
early days,

35:01.237 --> 35:03.480
since the footage was found
inside the hotel.

35:03.584 --> 35:09.072
But when I processed it,
that isn't what I saw at all.

35:09.176 --> 35:12.972
-What did you see?

35:13.076 --> 35:14.491
-The Carmichaels.

35:14.595 --> 35:22.810
[eerie music]

35:25.330 --> 35:26.779
[Film projector whirring
and clicking]

35:29.679 --> 35:32.958
-Hello.

35:33.061 --> 35:34.511
Margaret?

35:39.447 --> 35:41.208
Pat?
Are you guys still here?

35:46.523 --> 35:47.938
Hello?

35:51.942 --> 35:53.461
[Catherine yelps]

35:53.565 --> 35:55.360
[Pat laughs]

35:55.463 --> 35:57.155
You are an asshole, Pat.

35:57.258 --> 35:58.535
You guys scared the shit
outta me.

35:58.639 --> 36:00.227
-Hey, don't get mad
at me.

36:00.330 --> 36:01.642
It was all Margaret's idea,
okay?

36:01.745 --> 36:03.678
-My idea?

36:03.782 --> 36:05.784
You're the one who said
we needed to add some drama

36:05.887 --> 36:07.475
to Catherine's movies.

36:07.579 --> 36:09.063
-These aren't supposed to be
manufactured drama.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.479
It's like
cinema verite.

36:11.583 --> 36:12.825
That's the whole point
of the project.

36:12.929 --> 36:14.310
-You're lucky.

36:14.413 --> 36:15.587
Pat wanted me to hide
in your closet.

36:15.690 --> 36:16.829
-That would've
been awesome.

36:16.933 --> 36:18.141
C'mon, we gotta go.

36:18.245 --> 36:19.384
We gotta avoid
the bridge traffic.

36:19.487 --> 36:21.006
-Where are
you guys going?

36:21.109 --> 36:23.008
-My first rehearsals
in the city today.

36:23.111 --> 36:25.148
We're doing "Faust"
in three weeks.

36:25.252 --> 36:26.598
Pat's gracious enough
to gimme a lift.

36:26.701 --> 36:28.358
-Well, can I come with
you guys?

36:28.462 --> 36:30.049
I mean, that would make for
some great footage.

36:30.153 --> 36:31.844
-Mom said
you have to stay here.

36:31.948 --> 36:33.846
Don't worry.
We'll be home before dinner.

36:33.950 --> 36:36.470
Get one last shot of me
before I go shine on stage.

36:42.096 --> 36:47.066
-Sadly, that was the last image
ever taken of Margaret.

36:47.170 --> 36:50.311
She was killed
later that evening.

36:50.415 --> 36:54.384
And Patrick was never
the same again.

37:02.496 --> 37:05.775
-There really is
no obvious motive here,

37:05.878 --> 37:07.777
and that is
the most frustrating part.

37:07.880 --> 37:10.469
-Find anything interesting
at the antique shop?

37:10.573 --> 37:12.609
-About the Carmichaels?
Sadly, no.

37:12.713 --> 37:15.923
But we found a lot of weird shit
about the Abaddon Hotel.

37:16.026 --> 37:18.339
So, listen to this.

37:18.443 --> 37:19.685
"Something's coming.
Cold, the nightfall.

37:19.789 --> 37:22.619
All things die and
never come back."

37:24.034 --> 37:28.625
-Well, that, that
sounds like a fun nursery rhyme.

37:28.729 --> 37:30.696
-It's like a bunch of notes
that were meant to be burned,

37:30.800 --> 37:33.975
but instead someone put
them inside of a clock.

37:34.079 --> 37:36.323
Okay, wait, there's one
more that I wanna read.

37:37.220 --> 37:38.808
This one, this one, this one.

37:38.911 --> 37:40.810
"When they return,

37:40.913 --> 37:44.400
the most common side effect
is bleeding from the face.

37:44.503 --> 37:49.508
Doc says some form of he-
mm, haemo-haemolacria?

37:51.165 --> 37:52.684
Can you Google
that or something?

37:54.272 --> 37:56.274
-Return from where?

37:56.377 --> 37:57.516
-I don't know.

37:58.172 --> 37:59.587
-Hey, what's this?

37:59.691 --> 38:01.727
-I found that in the
Abaddon clock, too.

38:03.281 --> 38:05.835
-Might keep it in my room.
I could use some good luck.

38:07.802 --> 38:09.977
[entity giggling]
-Shit, Chase.

38:10.080 --> 38:11.289
There is a light on the camera.

38:11.392 --> 38:12.531
Just hit that button
on the left side.

38:12.635 --> 38:14.326
-All right,
hang on, hang on.

38:14.430 --> 38:15.293
-Come on. Not that hard.
-There's a lot of buttons.

38:15.396 --> 38:17.398
Hang on.

38:17.502 --> 38:18.606
There we go.
-Good job.

38:18.710 --> 38:19.331
-All right, where
are the breakers?

38:19.435 --> 38:21.264
Do you know?

38:21.368 --> 38:25.889
-Yes, they should
be, follow me,

38:26.614 --> 38:27.857
closet near the front.

38:36.555 --> 38:38.316
-As if this
place can get any creepier.

38:38.419 --> 38:39.455
-I know, right?

38:39.558 --> 38:41.526
-It's
gonna be fine. Stop.

38:43.079 --> 38:45.219
[Margot sighs]

38:45.323 --> 38:47.014
[knob rattling]

38:47.117 --> 38:49.396
Uh.

38:49.499 --> 38:51.225
-Oh.
-Oh, fuck.

38:51.329 --> 38:52.847
-Well, I guess we
don't need the breakers.

38:52.951 --> 38:54.504
-You got it.
-God,

38:54.608 --> 38:56.334
I was not about to stay
here without any power.

38:56.437 --> 38:57.404
-Yeah,
sorry about that.

38:57.507 --> 38:59.751
Donald said that might hap...

39:01.339 --> 39:02.650
-What?

39:03.513 --> 39:04.652
Margot, what?

39:09.036 --> 39:09.864
What the...

39:14.766 --> 39:17.355
-Is that from
the chest that was upstairs.

39:18.356 --> 39:20.634
-Shit, Margot.

39:20.737 --> 39:22.877
I'm telling you,
something's not right here.

39:22.981 --> 39:24.810
[brooding music]

39:34.613 --> 39:36.615
-Where
are you, by the way?

39:36.719 --> 39:37.858
Margot?

39:37.961 --> 39:39.031
Oh, hey.

39:39.135 --> 39:40.032
Have you seen Margot?

39:40.136 --> 39:42.656
-Yeah, she's outside, um,

39:42.759 --> 39:43.898
hey, could I talk
to you for a second?

39:44.002 --> 39:45.279
-Yeah, sure.

39:45.383 --> 39:47.730
-Like you, you
put on fresh sheets.

39:47.833 --> 39:49.766
-Yeah. The the
other ones had like an odor-

39:49.870 --> 39:53.045
-Right, like a, like
a, like an old sweater.

39:53.149 --> 39:54.046
-Yeah, I guess.

39:54.150 --> 39:55.082
-Yeah, yeah, mine too.

39:55.185 --> 39:56.704
-Uh, but, what's up?

39:56.808 --> 39:57.395
Is, is this a
camera-friendly conversation?

39:57.498 --> 39:59.258
-Oh, yeah.

39:59.362 --> 40:00.570
Keep filming. I, I don't care.

40:00.674 --> 40:02.848
Um, I, I just
wanted to, you know,

40:02.952 --> 40:06.438
gauge your comfort level
with, with all this.

40:06.542 --> 40:08.302
-Comfort level?

40:08.406 --> 40:09.614
-You know, Margot,

40:09.717 --> 40:10.925
she, she, she goes
on these crusades

40:11.029 --> 40:12.686
and, and she doesn't
know how to stop.

40:12.789 --> 40:14.584
I mean, she can be
a little obsessive

40:14.688 --> 40:19.693
and, and I'm sure that's part
of the reasons you love her.

40:20.314 --> 40:21.660
-But...?

40:21.764 --> 40:23.593
-Right, I just, I
just wanna make sure

40:23.697 --> 40:26.147
that we don't stay any longer
than we have to, you know?

40:26.251 --> 40:28.633
So like, if, if, if at any point

40:28.736 --> 40:30.151
this gets to be too much for you

40:30.255 --> 40:31.705
and you want to leave, just know

40:31.808 --> 40:33.741
that, that I totally
have your back, okay?

40:34.570 --> 40:37.020
-Yeah. Thanks, Chase.

40:37.124 --> 40:38.366
I, I think I'm okay for now.

40:38.470 --> 40:40.852
As long as I have internet.

40:40.955 --> 40:42.025
-Right.

40:43.958 --> 40:47.479
Wait, well, good, good luck
with, with your call now.

40:47.583 --> 40:49.447
-Oh! [chuckles]

40:49.550 --> 40:51.345
Oh yeah. Thanks.

40:51.449 --> 40:53.174
[gentle music]

40:53.278 --> 40:55.729
-In all the decades of rumors

40:55.832 --> 40:58.870
and stories surrounding
the Carmichael Manor,

40:58.973 --> 41:01.942
you could tell just after
watching the first day

41:02.045 --> 41:06.049
of Margot's footage that
they were all probably true,

41:07.430 --> 41:09.570
but they weren't really
phased at all by any of this.

41:09.674 --> 41:11.917
Oddly enough, it was Chase

41:12.021 --> 41:16.163
who first started urging
a little more caution,

41:16.266 --> 41:18.821
suggesting that maybe
they don't have to stay

41:18.924 --> 41:24.689
the full five days,
but then it got worse.

41:30.280 --> 41:32.455
-Hey.

41:32.559 --> 41:34.353
-Hey, Rebecca,
how have you been?

41:34.457 --> 41:35.527
-Hey. Hey, Linda.

41:35.631 --> 41:37.356
How's it going?

41:37.460 --> 41:40.705
[audio warbling]

41:41.637 --> 41:42.948
Okay. There you go.

41:43.052 --> 41:44.605
Hi. Sorry about
the poor service.

41:44.709 --> 41:46.849
I am out in the
country with Margot.

41:46.952 --> 41:49.368
But I should still be able
to share my presentation.

41:49.472 --> 41:50.956
Fingers crossed.

41:51.060 --> 41:53.165
-I love spending
time in the country.

41:53.269 --> 41:54.546
How is it there?

41:55.582 --> 41:57.860
-It is different.

41:57.963 --> 41:59.689
[Linda laughs]

41:59.793 --> 42:02.830
-That's what makes it great.

42:02.934 --> 42:04.798
-All these listings
are old Colonial style,

42:04.901 --> 42:06.593
which is perfect
for us to take on

42:06.696 --> 42:08.180
because they need a lot of work.

42:08.284 --> 42:11.045
Um, here, let me get
a screen share going

42:11.149 --> 42:12.978
and I will show you
the listing pictures.

42:21.159 --> 42:22.022
-Oh, wow.

42:24.714 --> 42:25.922
-[chuckles] Right?

42:30.375 --> 42:32.204
-[chuckles] What was that?

42:32.308 --> 42:34.655
-Sorry, I don't know
how that got there.

42:42.214 --> 42:44.009
-I love this listing.

42:44.113 --> 42:46.633
What's the ask on
this one again?

42:46.736 --> 42:48.324
-This one is 230,000.

42:48.427 --> 42:49.394
-Excellent.

42:49.497 --> 42:51.223
Good find, Rebecca.

42:51.327 --> 42:53.605
-Thanks.

42:53.709 --> 42:54.675
Here, let me show
you this next one.

42:54.779 --> 42:56.643
I know you're gonna love it too.

42:57.954 --> 42:59.507
Um...

42:59.611 --> 43:00.819
-Whoa.

43:02.269 --> 43:03.857
I think it's nice,

43:03.960 --> 43:06.238
but that foyer doesn't
really scream fixer upper.

43:06.342 --> 43:08.447
[brooding music]

43:08.551 --> 43:10.864
-Wait, I'm sorry.

43:10.967 --> 43:13.729
This, this, this isn't right.

43:20.770 --> 43:22.185
-Beautiful staircase.

43:29.468 --> 43:30.849
Is this the wrong file?

43:32.126 --> 43:34.819
-This isn't the file.
I, I didn't take these.

43:38.339 --> 43:39.720
-Everything okay, Rebecca?

43:51.525 --> 43:52.664
Who is that?

43:52.768 --> 43:55.909
Is that, is that you?

44:05.712 --> 44:06.920
Honey, are you okay?

44:10.095 --> 44:12.650
Do you need to take a
break to sort this out?

44:12.753 --> 44:16.654
[brooding music continues]

44:36.915 --> 44:41.126
[Rebecca and Linda scream]

44:46.131 --> 44:48.133
-So theoretically,
Linda has it recorded, yeah?

44:48.237 --> 44:49.928
-Margot, I don't care
if they recorded it.

44:50.032 --> 44:51.481
I never wanna see that again.

44:51.585 --> 44:52.448
Do you not get that?
-Yes.

44:52.551 --> 44:53.794
I know you are upset.

44:53.898 --> 44:54.830
That is clear.
-No shit I'm upset.

44:54.933 --> 44:56.314
-I know. So it doesn't matter.

44:56.417 --> 44:57.867
I need to see it.

44:57.971 --> 44:59.662
-Margot, I don't care
if you wanna see it.

44:59.766 --> 45:01.008
I, I probably lost my job today.

45:01.112 --> 45:03.701
-Well, wait,
what, what happened?

45:03.804 --> 45:04.943
-Rebecca said that
she saw something weird

45:05.047 --> 45:07.981
on her video conference,
like a person.

45:08.084 --> 45:11.570
-In this room, in a
picture with me in it.

45:11.674 --> 45:12.848
-Shit, are you okay?
-She's fine.

45:12.951 --> 45:15.367
-I'm not fucking fine, Margot.

45:15.471 --> 45:16.955
You, you didn't see it. I...

45:17.059 --> 45:18.992
I knew I shouldn't
have come this time.

45:19.095 --> 45:20.131
-[laughs] Okay, so
now it's my fault.

45:21.270 --> 45:24.376
-Margot, I may have
lost the only job

45:24.480 --> 45:26.344
getting us any income.

45:26.447 --> 45:29.796
You-Listen, I love that you
hunt these old ghost stories,

45:29.899 --> 45:32.143
but i-it's just a hobby.

45:32.246 --> 45:34.455
It doesn't pay the bills,
it does nothing for us.

45:34.559 --> 45:36.181
You and me. Okay?

45:36.285 --> 45:38.839
It just satisfies some
obscure obsession you have.

45:38.943 --> 45:41.290
-What the fuck are you doing?

45:41.393 --> 45:43.119
-I'm getting out of
here, okay? We all should.

45:43.223 --> 45:46.744
Congrats, this place
is the real deal.

45:46.847 --> 45:47.848
Now let's get the
hell out of here.

45:47.952 --> 45:49.263
-Okay so where you're losing me

45:49.367 --> 45:51.127
is you mock all these
places that we go to

45:51.231 --> 45:53.233
because "Oh, they
might be haunted,"

45:53.336 --> 45:55.994
but then when a place actually
might be you want to leave?

45:56.098 --> 45:57.685
-Yeah.

45:57.789 --> 45:59.273
And I'm sure that I'm not the
only one that feels that way.

45:59.377 --> 46:00.896
Chase?

46:00.999 --> 46:05.417
-I, I, I'm, I-
I agree with Rebecca.

46:05.521 --> 46:07.212
I mean, you know,

46:07.316 --> 46:09.076
I don't think we should
stay longer than we have to.

46:09.663 --> 46:10.802
-There you go.

46:13.356 --> 46:14.116
-Thank you.

46:17.326 --> 46:18.499
Okay. Okay.

46:18.603 --> 46:19.915
Can you just turn that off

46:20.018 --> 46:20.985
and give me and
Rebecca time to talk?

46:22.641 --> 46:24.333
-Yeah.

46:34.239 --> 46:38.312
Hey, Becs. How are
you holding up?

46:41.315 --> 46:43.697
-I appreciate your
dedication to the camera.

46:43.801 --> 46:46.079
-Hey, if we're
gonna stay one more night,

46:46.182 --> 46:50.117
might as well give
Margot a full card.

46:51.601 --> 46:53.741
Plus, I'm afraid she might
yell at me if I put it down.

46:53.845 --> 46:56.399
[Rebecca chuckles]

46:56.503 --> 47:01.370
-One more night, then, then
we leave in the morning.

47:03.613 --> 47:06.133
-Hey, you're not
gonna get any pushback from me.

47:09.585 --> 47:10.448
-What's she up to now?

47:11.311 --> 47:13.416
-Oh, you know,

47:13.520 --> 47:17.386
just retracing the exact steps
of the killer and victims.

47:18.974 --> 47:20.492
For what? Like the
thousandth time?

47:24.842 --> 47:26.360
So, do you still have a job?

47:29.432 --> 47:30.709
-The internet hasn't worked
since my presentation,

47:30.813 --> 47:32.021
so who knows.

47:34.713 --> 47:37.647
-Hey, you're
gonna be all right.

47:37.751 --> 47:40.374
[subdued music]

47:49.176 --> 47:51.489
-I can't make this make sense.

47:51.592 --> 47:53.318
-What?

47:53.422 --> 47:55.976
-It's an old photo
from the Abaddon clock.

47:56.080 --> 47:58.599
-Yeah, the pictures
of the Abaddon Hotel,

47:58.703 --> 48:00.256
those make sense.

48:00.360 --> 48:01.533
But this?

48:03.915 --> 48:05.883
-And is that?
-Yes.

48:05.986 --> 48:06.953
-What the fuck?

48:07.056 --> 48:10.957
-I know. And look at the back.

48:11.060 --> 48:15.099
Clarksburg Fair,
West Virginia, 1975.

48:16.272 --> 48:18.654
Do you see that carnival
game in the back?

48:18.757 --> 48:21.795
That is the exact game
that is currently upstairs

48:21.899 --> 48:23.659
at this very mansion

48:23.762 --> 48:27.628
with the same two clown costumes
on those two mannequins.

48:27.732 --> 48:29.803
-Three mannequins.
-What?

48:29.907 --> 48:31.805
-There's three
mannequins upstairs.

48:31.909 --> 48:33.980
-I, what does it all mean?

48:34.083 --> 48:35.740
-[laughs] I mean,
like, there it is.

48:35.843 --> 48:37.328
-There what is?

48:37.431 --> 48:40.331
-We officially have
a direct connection

48:40.434 --> 48:45.232
between this house
and the Abaddon Hotel.

48:46.647 --> 48:49.029
Explain to me how this
game gets from Clarksburg

48:49.133 --> 48:50.686
to the middle of
nowhere, Rockland County.

48:50.789 --> 48:55.001
And then this photo gets
in the Abaddon Hotel clock?

48:55.104 --> 48:59.281
-Maybe, um, maybe we
should leave tonight.

48:59.384 --> 49:03.285
-No! We are just actually-
[call button ringing]

49:05.287 --> 49:07.185
-What
the fuck was that?

49:09.222 --> 49:13.295
-The, th-th-the call button.

49:13.398 --> 49:15.504
Someone's upstairs c-
calling down to the kitchen.

49:23.236 --> 49:24.478
[call button ringing]

49:24.582 --> 49:25.617
Holy sh- Margot.

49:25.721 --> 49:27.205
-Right, how, how, how

49:27.309 --> 49:28.517
do we know what
room's coming from?

49:28.620 --> 49:31.209
-It's, it's, it's in
there above the door.

49:31.313 --> 49:32.314
-All right, all right. Hang on.

49:32.417 --> 49:33.453
-Go.

49:37.905 --> 49:39.493
-It, it says Patrick.

49:40.563 --> 49:42.013
-Okay. Okay.

49:42.117 --> 49:43.152
Come with me. Let's go.
-All right, all right,

49:43.256 --> 49:44.153
all right.
-You, you guys

49:44.257 --> 49:45.396
are going up there?

49:45.499 --> 49:47.605
-Yes. And stay here.
Stay here.

49:47.708 --> 49:48.640
Use the camera.

49:49.710 --> 49:50.780
Go.

49:55.544 --> 49:56.545
-Shh.

50:11.353 --> 50:12.354
Looks like the light's
on in the room.

50:12.457 --> 50:15.978
-Was that on before?
-I don't know.

50:16.082 --> 50:19.671
[Chase breathing heavily]

50:21.915 --> 50:23.054
Hello?

50:29.509 --> 50:30.579
Hello.

50:30.682 --> 50:32.408
Hang on.

50:39.105 --> 50:40.865
Jesus.
-Watch it!

50:40.968 --> 50:43.454
-Holy shit.
-Fuck.

50:45.352 --> 50:46.767
-Jesus. How the did
that get in here, Margot?

50:46.871 --> 50:48.562
-I don't...

50:48.666 --> 50:49.770
[both breathing heavily]

50:49.874 --> 50:52.221
-Oh, shit.

50:52.325 --> 50:55.673
It's fucking staring at us.
-I know, I know.

50:56.950 --> 50:57.847
-All right, hang on.

50:57.951 --> 50:59.194
-Okay.
-Hang on.

51:02.438 --> 51:03.646
-Fuck.

51:16.003 --> 51:17.626
Touch it.
-Fuck. Shh.

51:20.629 --> 51:21.595
Fuck.

51:23.873 --> 51:27.153
[Margot sighs]
Okay.

51:27.256 --> 51:28.292
-See,
just a mannequin.

51:28.395 --> 51:29.707
-Fucking
clowns, Margot.

51:29.810 --> 51:31.122
You had to pick somewhere

51:31.226 --> 51:32.882
with clowns.
-Dude, shut up. It's fine.

51:32.986 --> 51:35.644
-Okay, well.

51:37.024 --> 51:39.889
-Guys?
Anyone up there?

51:39.993 --> 51:42.444
[door clatters and creaks]

51:45.964 --> 51:47.104
Hello?

51:49.382 --> 51:53.213
[Rebecca breathing shakily]

52:12.405 --> 52:16.443
[ball thuds softly]
[Rebecca gasps]

52:21.310 --> 52:27.351
[gasps] Who's there? [whimpers]

52:46.128 --> 52:47.060
[eerie music]

52:47.164 --> 52:50.028
[Rebecca exhales softly]

52:50.132 --> 52:52.652
[dramatic music]
[Rebecca shrieks]

52:52.755 --> 52:54.378
-What's
wrong? What happened?

52:54.481 --> 52:56.000
-In t-t-the, in
the closet. In the closet.

52:56.103 --> 52:58.968
-Go!
-All right. All right.

52:59.072 --> 53:01.454
[eerie music]

53:04.353 --> 53:06.355
Fuck. Fucking clowns.

53:07.253 --> 53:08.254
-Can
we go? Can we go?

53:08.357 --> 53:11.188
Can we go, now?
-Jesus.

53:11.291 --> 53:13.466
What did mom tell you
about what happened to me?

53:14.570 --> 53:16.193
-Do you
wanna talk about it?

53:18.540 --> 53:22.233
-I saw this little
girl all alone,

53:23.924 --> 53:26.479
and then she said that
she couldn't find her mom,

53:27.825 --> 53:29.344
so I wanted to help her.

53:29.447 --> 53:30.552
-Good. That's-
-No, not good.

53:33.796 --> 53:34.728
-Why not?
-Because,

53:34.832 --> 53:35.729
because, she wasn't real.

53:37.248 --> 53:39.492
She kept, she kept disappearing

53:39.595 --> 53:42.771
and then, and appearing
wherever I was that day.

53:44.635 --> 53:46.602
She said that her and her
mom were staying at a hotel

53:47.845 --> 53:49.847
and that she couldn't
find her mom.

53:49.950 --> 53:53.471
I wanted to help her, but
she kept disappearing.

53:54.886 --> 53:57.855
And then I realized that,
well, she's not real.

53:57.958 --> 53:58.856
She must be in my head.

53:58.959 --> 54:00.685
-That's okay, Chase.

54:00.789 --> 54:02.135
That's, that's why we want
you to stay on the medication-

54:02.239 --> 54:03.343
-But I was.

54:04.689 --> 54:07.727
And it shouldn't have happened.
But she was so real to me.

54:08.831 --> 54:10.488
And the last thing
that she said,

54:10.592 --> 54:11.662
it never stuck out to
me until being here,

54:15.079 --> 54:17.426
she said, "Go with Margot."

54:18.634 --> 54:21.223
Then the next day you called me

54:21.327 --> 54:22.845
and asked me to
come with you here.

54:26.228 --> 54:27.160
-Um...
-No. No

54:27.264 --> 54:29.818
Don't try to bullshit me.

54:30.784 --> 54:32.372
This place is fucked. All right?

54:32.476 --> 54:35.030
Something is, is
messing with us.

54:35.133 --> 54:38.136
It probably doesn't want us
here, so let's not disappoint.

54:38.240 --> 54:39.379
Okay?

54:40.138 --> 54:41.657
Tomorrow, right?
-Yeah.

54:43.038 --> 54:45.558
Yeah. Tomorrow. [groans]

54:46.800 --> 54:51.011
Hey, you gonna be
okay all by yourself?

54:51.115 --> 54:52.392
Do you wanna bunk
with me and Becs?

54:52.496 --> 54:55.533
-No. I am gonna drink.
[Margot scoffs]

54:55.637 --> 54:56.948
All right? That
will help the sleep.

54:57.052 --> 54:58.743
-Okay.

54:59.157 --> 55:00.849
Um,

55:03.369 --> 55:04.784
you know I love you, right?

55:06.199 --> 55:07.856
-I love you too.

55:09.271 --> 55:10.376
-Good.

55:11.169 --> 55:16.485
Good night.
-Night.

55:17.348 --> 55:20.731
[wind whistling softly]

55:26.219 --> 55:29.843
-Rebecca.

55:29.947 --> 55:30.844
Rebecca.

55:34.158 --> 55:35.366
-What?

55:35.470 --> 55:36.850
-Did you hear that?

55:41.510 --> 55:42.615
I thought I heard like a shout

55:42.718 --> 55:45.342
and a thud right
outside our room.

55:52.210 --> 55:53.384
Hold this.

56:25.382 --> 56:27.591
-What is it?

56:39.568 --> 56:42.468
We're okay?
-Yeah.

56:42.571 --> 56:43.779
I think so.

57:03.247 --> 57:06.284
[door clatters]

57:06.388 --> 57:07.147
-What's wrong?

57:19.332 --> 57:20.851
Is, is that Chase's?

57:22.473 --> 57:23.854
-Chase? Chase?

57:30.032 --> 57:31.344
Shit.

57:31.448 --> 57:32.932
Where the hell are you?

57:33.035 --> 57:35.762
-He's not
downstairs or outside.

57:35.866 --> 57:39.870
-Um, can can
you call his phone again?

57:41.630 --> 57:44.564
[phone buzzing]

57:46.221 --> 57:49.880
Um, hey, it's in here.

57:52.745 --> 57:53.815
-What do you think?

57:53.918 --> 57:55.161
-I, I
don't, I don't know.

57:55.264 --> 57:56.576
I guess I got, I-I got a
text from him last night

57:56.680 --> 57:58.992
saying, "Was that you?"

58:00.200 --> 58:01.995
-"Was that you," what?

58:02.099 --> 58:04.688
-I don't know. You were
sleeping, so I didn't respond.

58:04.791 --> 58:06.413
Um, he, he probably heard
the same thing I did

58:06.517 --> 58:07.760
when I woke up, right?

58:16.216 --> 58:18.771
[dark music]

58:18.874 --> 58:19.841
Rebecca?

58:23.672 --> 58:24.639
-[Bradley] What we know now

58:24.742 --> 58:27.987
is that Chase didn't wander off.

58:29.678 --> 58:31.646
[scoffs] Of course he didn't.

58:33.164 --> 58:34.303
Hard to understand.

58:35.512 --> 58:36.858
Even harder to watch

58:36.961 --> 58:38.894
if you, you've seen the video.

58:43.520 --> 58:44.762
And I have.

58:55.532 --> 58:58.638
[liquor sloshing]

59:05.576 --> 59:07.474
-Well, Margot,

59:07.578 --> 59:11.893
ya really picked a winner with
this place. [chuckles softly]

59:14.412 --> 59:19.590
Let's just hope that we
all live to tell the tale.

59:24.112 --> 59:26.701
[Chase sighs]

59:30.774 --> 59:34.053
[door knocking roughly]

59:51.277 --> 59:52.105
Margot?

59:56.178 --> 59:57.076
Margot?

01:00:25.552 --> 01:00:27.900
[sighs] All right. I think
that's enough for tonight.

01:00:40.706 --> 01:00:44.571
Someone keeps
knocking on the door,

01:00:44.675 --> 01:00:46.746
but there's nobody there.

01:00:53.442 --> 01:00:55.237
[door knocking roughly]

01:00:55.341 --> 01:00:59.863
There it is again, somebody
is outside my fucking door.

01:01:13.186 --> 01:01:16.293
[door knocking roughly]
Fuck this.

01:01:16.396 --> 01:01:18.916
[Chase breathing steadily]

01:01:40.179 --> 01:01:42.802
[Chase grunts]

01:01:48.912 --> 01:01:53.744
Nothing. [breathing heavily]

01:01:54.503 --> 01:01:58.024
Hello?

01:01:58.128 --> 01:01:58.991
Hello.

01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:03.892
Fuck.

01:02:12.590 --> 01:02:14.213
[lock clicks]

01:02:14.316 --> 01:02:15.766
All right, Margot,

01:02:15.870 --> 01:02:17.457
as soon as the sun comes
up, we are outta here.

01:02:17.561 --> 01:02:20.150
I love you. But, but this
place is absolutely fucked.

01:02:26.812 --> 01:02:30.263
[Chase breathing heavily]

01:02:33.439 --> 01:02:35.061
I just heard my door open.

01:02:36.683 --> 01:02:39.341
Fuck. Something
just opened my door.

01:02:42.103 --> 01:02:47.798

Tully was once a
deeply-religious man

with a family living in
Arkansas in the 1960s.

01:11:30.941 --> 01:11:32.322

who died tragically,
Abigail Tully.

becomes a little hazy

before they moved to
Abaddon, New York,

is that they ran a gaming

in West Virginia,

his closest confidants.

to Abaddon, New York,

cover story hotel

01:12:28.516 --> 01:12:30.898

And I think, I think
we're gonna make it

all I got for you.

I guess tomorrow
we're gonna get a tow

01:16:16.917 --> 01:16:19.713
and keep looking for Chase.

Do you see anything?

right now? Just stop.

ever a time to make sure

wanna get out of here.

Okay. I don't care about
your stupid murders.

I never did-
-There's a reason

01:20:02.556 --> 01:20:04.247
that this is happening.

01:20:04.351 --> 01:20:06.284
Everything that we've seen,
those things in the woods,

01:20:06.387 --> 01:20:07.733
it means that we're getting
closer to the truth.

I'm fucking sorry

01:20:13.912 --> 01:20:15.362
that I ever brought
you here, okay?

01:20:15.465 --> 01:20:16.742
I didn't think I was taking
you against your will,

I thought you
actually wanted to.

Chase. It's a text from Chase.

-It just says, "Hi."

left it in his room.

G-good. Maybe he's
back in his room.

-No don't,
don't, don't go.

you come to our room?

suicide at the Abaddon Hotel

01:30:40.469 --> 01:30:42.609
Fuck, why won't you work?

01:30:42.713 --> 01:30:44.542
-Fuck,
fuck, fuck. Okay.

01:30:44.646 --> 01:30:46.613
Fuck, fuck, fuck. Okay.

01:30:46.717 --> 01:30:48.235
I need it to be like
that. I really...

01:30:48.339 --> 01:30:50.652
[Rebecca whimpering]

01:30:50.755 --> 01:30:53.655
-C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

01:30:55.035 --> 01:30:56.520
-Margot!

01:30:58.383 --> 01:31:01.525
-W-w-what was that?

01:31:01.628 --> 01:31:03.388
-Margot, please.
[tense music]

01:31:03.492 --> 01:31:05.149
-Wait, Margot. Margot.

01:31:05.252 --> 01:31:06.115
Something's not right. I
don't think that's Chase.

01:31:06.219 --> 01:31:07.116
-It's him. It's him.

01:31:07.220 --> 01:31:08.808
I know it's him.

01:31:08.911 --> 01:31:10.188
-Margot, I'm asking
you, please, that's not him.

01:31:10.292 --> 01:31:11.742
Don't go.

01:31:11.845 --> 01:31:12.950
-Just stay
here and lock the door.

01:31:13.053 --> 01:31:14.020
-Margot.

01:31:14.123 --> 01:31:15.055
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:31:15.159 --> 01:31:16.263
It's working. It's working.

01:31:16.367 --> 01:31:17.817
Hi, my name is Rebecca Vickers.

01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:20.578
We're at Carmichael Manor
at 101 Starlight Drive,

01:31:20.682 --> 01:31:21.717
please, something's
in the house with us.

01:31:21.821 --> 01:31:23.754
Margot! That's not him!

01:31:23.857 --> 01:31:25.341
Fuck!

01:31:25.445 --> 01:31:26.757
Hello? Hello?

01:31:27.274 --> 01:31:29.345
Shit.

01:31:29.449 --> 01:31:30.864

01:31:43.256 --> 01:31:44.153
[Rebecca shrieks]

01:31:44.257 --> 01:31:47.294
[static buzzing]

01:31:47.398 --> 01:31:50.746
[Rebecca whimpering]

01:31:54.509 --> 01:31:57.477
[Rebecca shrieking]

01:31:57.581 --> 01:32:00.894
[wind whistling softly]

01:32:03.448 --> 01:32:06.866
[Margot breathing shakily]

01:32:07.487 --> 01:32:08.695
-Hey, Chase.

01:32:11.318 --> 01:32:12.665
Hey, hey Chase.

01:32:14.252 --> 01:32:16.082
Oh my God! Oh my God!

01:32:16.185 --> 01:32:17.290
Fuck. Fuck, Chase.

01:32:17.393 --> 01:32:22.019
Chase, no. [whimpering]

01:32:25.367 --> 01:32:26.679
Rebecca!

01:32:29.682 --> 01:32:32.650
Rebecca, Chase is hurt.

01:32:33.996 --> 01:32:34.894
Chase is hurt.

01:32:36.309 --> 01:32:38.207
Rebecca, we need to get help.

01:32:38.311 --> 01:32:40.451
Rebecca. No, no, no, no.

01:32:40.555 --> 01:32:42.315
Rebecca! Rebecca!

01:32:42.418 --> 01:32:43.316
Open the door!

01:32:43.419 --> 01:32:44.317
Please, please.

01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:45.629
Chase is hurt.

01:32:45.732 --> 01:32:50.012
Please, we have to- [shrieks]

01:32:50.116 --> 01:32:50.944
No, no!

01:32:54.914 --> 01:32:56.467
I know what you did.

01:32:56.571 --> 01:32:57.675
I was there.

01:32:57.779 --> 01:32:59.712
No, no, no. No, no, no.

01:32:59.815 --> 01:33:01.127
Please stop, please
stop, please stop.

01:33:01.230 --> 01:33:05.683
No, no. [yelps]

01:33:05.787 --> 01:33:07.754

I don't, [panting]

01:33:27.463 --> 01:33:28.775
please.

01:33:30.674 --> 01:33:33.193
It's not over. [shrieks]

01:33:33.297 --> 01:33:35.920
[static crackling]

01:33:40.545 --> 01:33:41.546
[subdued music]

01:33:41.650 --> 01:33:44.101
-Evil never dies.

01:33:50.521 --> 01:33:53.179
No fire will ever destroy it.

01:33:59.047 --> 01:34:02.153
You can never claim
victory over it.

01:34:07.503 --> 01:34:12.129
That evil will always exist
and it will always be there.

01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:21.241
Sometimes in plain sight.

01:34:21.345 --> 01:34:23.899
[eerie music]

01:34:45.231 --> 01:34:49.684
[film projector
clicking and whirring]

01:34:49.787 --> 01:34:52.894
-If anyone finds
this recording,

01:34:56.691 --> 01:34:58.934
I had no choice. [sobs]

01:35:03.663 --> 01:35:07.080
We all serve him
in different ways.

01:35:09.393 --> 01:35:11.913
[man groaning]

01:35:17.608 --> 01:35:18.816
Stop talking!

01:35:21.716 --> 01:35:23.165
It'll be over soon.

01:35:24.788 --> 01:35:27.894
[film whirring]

01:35:42.909 --> 01:35:43.807

01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:46.982
[gentle dark music]

01:35:58.269 --> 01:36:00.927
[film whirring]

01:36:19.946 --> 01:36:23.916
[gentle dark music continues]

01:36:45.730 --> 01:36:49.251
[gentle dark music continues]

01:37:19.903 --> 01:37:23.354
[gentle dark music continues]

01:37:54.006 --> 01:37:55.697
-Did you guys hear

01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:58.527
that Rockland County's
starting the fair up again?

01:37:58.631 --> 01:37:59.528
-[chuckles] No way.

01:37:59.632 --> 01:38:01.945
-Yeah, right in Abaddon.

01:38:02.048 --> 01:38:03.947
I guess, they figured
since the hotel's gone,

01:38:04.050 --> 01:38:05.603
all is well again.

01:38:07.467 --> 01:38:09.918
[dark music]
