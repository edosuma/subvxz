WEBVTT

00:09.142 --> 00:10.110
It's official.

00:10.110 --> 00:12.101
Dr. Lee says we're pregnant.

00:13.613 --> 00:16.116
Oh, I'm so excited .

00:16.116 --> 00:18.107
Hello in there .

00:18.618 --> 00:20.620
It's your pater .

00:20.620 --> 00:21.609
Oh, stop it.

00:23.623 --> 00:26.126
So, how do you want to
make the announcement?

00:26.126 --> 00:28.128
Uh... Well, Frasier's on
his way over. We could...

00:28.128 --> 00:29.629
No.

00:29.629 --> 00:31.131
He's a blabber mouth.

00:31.131 --> 00:33.133
Let's have him and your
dad over for dinner tonight

00:33.133 --> 00:35.135
and we can tell them at the same time.

00:35.135 --> 00:36.636
If you already had a plan,

00:36.636 --> 00:38.138
why did you ask me
how I wanted to do it?

00:38.138 --> 00:40.140
Well, because if you'd
have had the same idea,

00:40.140 --> 00:41.641
then I could have agreed with it,

00:41.641 --> 00:43.632
which would have given you
the illusion of control.

00:45.645 --> 00:47.147
The waiting room had Cosmo.

00:47.147 --> 00:48.648
Oh.

00:48.648 --> 00:50.650
All right.

00:50.650 --> 00:51.651
I have just the quotation

00:51.651 --> 00:53.141
for the beginning of the announcement.

00:53.653 --> 00:55.143
It's from Robert Burns .

00:55.655 --> 00:57.657
"Beneath the shelter of an aged tree;

00:57.657 --> 01:02.151
"Th' expectant wee-things,
toddlin', stacher through

01:02.662 --> 01:06.655
To meet their dad, wi'
- filchterin' noise and glee

01:09.669 --> 01:10.670
Moving, eh?

01:10.670 --> 01:12.672
Yes, but not just because of the poem.

01:12.672 --> 01:14.674
I'm late for a hair appointment.

01:14.674 --> 01:15.675
Oh.

01:15.675 --> 01:17.177
Hi, you two. Hello.

01:17.177 --> 01:18.178
Hi, Daph. Good to see you.

01:18.178 --> 01:19.179
Hello, Niles.

01:19.179 --> 01:20.180
Hey.

01:20.180 --> 01:22.182
Uh, my usual, please.

01:22.182 --> 01:24.184
Well, I've ruined another relationship.

01:24.184 --> 01:26.686
I suppose you'll want to
hear the whole sorry tale.

01:26.686 --> 01:27.687
No, thank you.

01:27.687 --> 01:29.189
Last night, Julia came over

01:29.189 --> 01:31.191
and, as usual, I made a mess of things.

01:31.191 --> 01:32.692
Did you say no?

01:32.692 --> 01:34.694
I said, "No, thank you. "

01:34.694 --> 01:37.185
But I wish to unburden myself.

01:37.497 --> 01:41.501
And I wish to remain in my good mood.

01:41.501 --> 01:42.502
Therefore, I demur.

01:42.502 --> 01:43.491
You demur? I demur.

01:45.505 --> 01:47.507
Besides, I'm sure I've
heard it all before .

01:47.507 --> 01:49.202
But this time was
different-- I really thought

01:49.509 --> 01:51.500
BOTH: ...she could have been the one.

01:53.213 --> 01:55.215
Well.

01:55.215 --> 01:57.217
Silly me.

01:57.217 --> 01:59.519
To think that I could
count on my only brother

01:59.519 --> 02:01.521
for a shoulder on which to lean.

02:01.521 --> 02:03.223
What you need isn't a shoulder.

02:03.223 --> 02:04.224
It's a swift boot

02:04.224 --> 02:05.213
to break you out of this pattern.

02:06.526 --> 02:07.527
What pattern?

02:07.527 --> 02:09.229
Your pattern of ruining things

02:09.229 --> 02:10.229
before they've even begun.

02:10.229 --> 02:11.531
And when have I done that?

02:11.531 --> 02:13.233
Let me see.

02:13.233 --> 02:14.534
Fay. Cassandra.

02:14.534 --> 02:16.229
Chelsea, Claire,

02:16.536 --> 02:18.538
Lana, Abby, Mia, Marie.

02:18.538 --> 02:22.542
Oh, all right. I knew I had a pattern.

02:22.542 --> 02:25.245
I just didn't think
you'd remember the names.

02:25.245 --> 02:27.247
The minute you develop
feelings for someone

02:27.247 --> 02:30.250
you get scared and find
some way to sabotage things.

02:30.250 --> 02:31.551
I'd like to strike you, of course,

02:31.551 --> 02:33.553
but you speak the truth.

02:33.553 --> 02:37.190
I tell you what, I will never
find a happy relationship

02:37.190 --> 02:39.181
un-unless I can break out
of this maddening cycle.

02:39.492 --> 02:41.194
Well, all right, all right.

02:41.194 --> 02:43.496
The next time you find
yourself doing it again--

02:43.496 --> 02:46.199
fixating, say, on some
tiny fault of the woman--

02:46.199 --> 02:48.497
recognize what that is,
you're feeling vulnerable,

02:49.202 --> 02:50.499
ear. but don't give in to the f

02:51.204 --> 02:53.195
Commit to commitment .

02:54.207 --> 02:55.508
Commit to commitment.

02:55.508 --> 02:57.203
Yes.

02:58.511 --> 03:00.547
It's a bit glib, but
nonetheless inspiring.

03:00.547 --> 03:01.514
Thank you, Niles.

03:01.514 --> 03:03.216
I'm going to call Julia

03:03.216 --> 03:06.219
and I will not take "no" for an answer.

03:06.219 --> 03:07.220
I may have walked in here

03:07.220 --> 03:09.211
the old fault-finding,
flaw-fleeing Flasier,

03:09.522 --> 03:11.217
but I leave a man
committed to commitment.

03:15.228 --> 03:16.229
You said "Flasier. "

03:16.229 --> 03:17.530
id. I did not. Yes, you d

03:17.530 --> 03:19.232
I most certainly did not.

03:19.232 --> 03:20.233
No, I heard you say "Flasier. "

03:20.233 --> 03:21.234
I've been saying my own name

03:21.234 --> 03:22.531
for the last 40-some odd years.

03:23.236 --> 03:23.531
I know, but your tongue...

03:29.776 --> 03:30.777
Oh.

03:30.777 --> 03:32.278
Hi, Dad.

03:32.278 --> 03:33.780
Before you say anything,

03:33.780 --> 03:35.281
if you know the score
to the Mariners game,

03:35.281 --> 03:38.284
don't tell me-- I'm
taping it to watch later.

03:38.284 --> 03:39.273
Dad, the odds of my knowing the score

03:39.786 --> 03:40.775
to the Mariners game are about the same

03:41.287 --> 03:43.221
as you knowing the score
to Pacific Overtures.

03:44.857 --> 03:46.347
Did, uh, Julia call? No. Sorry.

03:46.859 --> 03:48.224
Oh, damn.

03:48.628 --> 03:51.397
Well, at least this little
delivery will cheer me up.

03:51.397 --> 03:54.400
My new Frette hand towels have arrived.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.702
(gloating laughter)

03:55.702 --> 03:59.405
Direct from Italy, I give
you the spugna con frangia

03:59.405 --> 04:01.708
with the tulle lace insert, huh?

04:01.708 --> 04:02.709
Sounds fancy.

04:02.709 --> 04:05.411
Am I allowed to dry my hands on them?

04:05.411 --> 04:06.713
Well, you may miss the luxurious feel

04:06.713 --> 04:08.408
of your trouser fronts, but yes.

04:10.717 --> 04:13.419
You know, if you're really
down about this Julia thing,

04:13.419 --> 04:15.421
you can come with me
and Eddie to the circus.

04:15.421 --> 04:17.355
We're really going
to the v-E- T,

04:17.656 --> 04:20.360
but if I say that, he
won't get in the car.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.662
Thanks anyway, Dad.

04:22.662 --> 04:24.364
I'll just see you at Nile's and Daphne'?

04:24.364 --> 04:25.353
for dinner, all right?

04:25.665 --> 04:27.367
Maybe I'll take in a movie

04:27.367 --> 04:29.369
Oh, what are you going
to go see? Well, there's

04:29.369 --> 04:31.360
this new Russian film in t
own about a Crimean war vet.

04:32.372 --> 04:33.673
No, Eddie!

04:33.673 --> 04:36.676
Would it have killed you
to say "Crimean War circus"?

04:36.676 --> 04:38.378
Oh, for heaven's sake.

04:38.378 --> 04:40.380
I'm so sorry, Dad. I...

04:40.380 --> 04:41.381
Oh, well...

04:41.381 --> 04:42.382
Julia.

04:42.382 --> 04:44.684
You got my message.

04:44.684 --> 04:46.379
What message? I actually came

04:46.686 --> 04:49.689
because I think I dropped
an earring here last night.

04:49.689 --> 04:51.680
Oh. I'm... I'm sorry. Please, come in.

04:54.694 --> 04:56.396
So, what did it look like?

04:56.396 --> 04:59.699
Oh, it was just a small diamond stud.

04:59.699 --> 05:02.402
Right. Okay, yea h, you check there.

05:02.402 --> 05:03.699
So, uh, what was this message?

05:04.404 --> 05:07.407
Um... Oh, I just said that

05:07.407 --> 05:10.399
I found you bright and, uh,

05:10.710 --> 05:12.712
beautiful and engaging,

05:12.712 --> 05:14.703
and then...

05:16.349 --> 05:18.408
There was a sonnet.

05:22.055 --> 05:26.526
"Fair love's ship ne'er
sa ilo'er unstorm'd seas."

05:26.526 --> 05:30.018
The fickle stars, her
compass, bright and cruel... "

05:32.665 --> 05:34.367
It's pretty sappy stuff, huh ?

05:34.367 --> 05:36.569
No, it's sweet.

05:36.569 --> 05:38.071
Especially the end.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.539
So you did hear it.

05:39.539 --> 05:41.040
Yes, but, Frasier...

05:41.040 --> 05:43.042
I'm not looking for
just some office romance.

05:43.042 --> 05:44.544
I don't see the point
in getting involved

05:44.544 --> 05:46.546
unless it's heading somewhere.

05:46.546 --> 05:48.548
That's exactly where
I am in my life, too.

05:48.548 --> 05:51.050
After you walked out last night,

05:51.050 --> 05:52.552
I realized how badly I want

05:52.552 --> 05:54.554
to be in a real relationship,

05:54.554 --> 05:56.055
how ready I am to...

05:56.055 --> 05:58.057
well, for want of a better phrase,

05:58.057 --> 06:01.049
to commit to commitment.

06:02.562 --> 06:05.064
You're not just saying this
to get in my pants, are you?

06:05.064 --> 06:06.566
No.

06:06.566 --> 06:08.568
And if I did... get in your pants,

06:08.568 --> 06:12.060
well... I'd want t o stay there forever.

06:14.006 --> 06:17.009
I-I-I said that much more
elegantly in the sonnet.

06:17.009 --> 06:18.511
You know, I just remembered

06:18.511 --> 06:20.513
where I may have lost my earring.

06:20.513 --> 06:21.502
Really? Where? In your bedroom.

06:22.014 --> 06:24.016
Do you care to help me look?

06:24.016 --> 06:26.507
In my bed... Well, we were
never in my bedroom. I don 't...

06:28.621 --> 06:30.156
Oh.

06:30.156 --> 06:32.147
I see.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.802
Let's hope Frasier's ove n
is more reliable than ours.

06:42.802 --> 06:45.498
MARTIN: Well, it serves you right
for getting such a fancy one.

06:45.772 --> 06:47.473
Oh, it's just temperamental.

06:47.473 --> 06:49.475
My Gaggenau is German-engineered.

06:49.475 --> 06:50.772
It probably needs more power

06:51.477 --> 06:53.479
than my building's
old wiring can give it.

06:53.479 --> 06:55.777
Yeah, well, leave
it to the Germans--

06:56.482 --> 06:59.585
even their appliances crave power.

06:59.585 --> 07:01.988
So, when do you want to
make the big announcement?

07:01.988 --> 07:03.956
I think a toast before dinner.

07:03.956 --> 07:06.459
Let's hope Frasier checks
his messages after the movie,

07:06.459 --> 07:07.960
or he'll be heading over to our place.

07:07.960 --> 07:08.949
Yes, well, I'm sure he will.

07:09.462 --> 07:10.463
It's just as well

07:10.463 --> 07:12.465
not to have him here
while we're cooking.

07:12.465 --> 07:14.467
I can't stand his backseat basting.

07:14.467 --> 07:16.969
I was just dreaming about us.

07:16.969 --> 07:17.970
We were in a boat,

07:17.970 --> 07:20.506
floating down the Arno River.

07:20.506 --> 07:22.497
Have you ever been to fair Firenze?

07:22.975 --> 07:23.976
Oh, it's maybe my favorite city.

07:23.976 --> 07:25.978
Oh. Mine, too.

07:25.978 --> 07:26.967
Oh, I knew we'd be a good couple.

07:27.480 --> 07:28.981
Have you ever gone there for Christmas?

07:28.981 --> 07:29.970
No. I've always wanted to.

07:30.483 --> 07:31.484
Me, too.

07:31.484 --> 07:32.985
Well, then, let's go.

07:32.985 --> 07:33.953
Do you mean it?

07:33.953 --> 07:35.588
It sounds perfect.

07:35.588 --> 07:36.856
I'll tell you what.

07:36.856 --> 07:39.552
Let's toast this decision
with a glass of Chianti.

07:39.859 --> 07:40.553
Ooh, that sounds good.

07:40.860 --> 07:41.861
Oh, shoot.

07:41.861 --> 07:43.563
What?

07:43.563 --> 07:45.164
I just remembered-- I'm
supposed to have dinner

07:45.164 --> 07:46.999
at my brother and his
wife's house tonight.

07:46.999 --> 07:49.235
Uh... I'm just going to call and cancel.

07:49.235 --> 07:51.066
(phone ringing)

07:52.572 --> 07:53.573
Hello.

07:53.573 --> 07:55.575
Niles, it-it's Frasier. Listen . .

07:55.575 --> 07:56.576
I just got out of the movie,

07:56.576 --> 07:58.578
and it was so cold in the theater

07:58.578 --> 08:00.079
that I-I think I've...

08:00.079 --> 08:01.581
(with a hoarse voice)
: I think I've come down

08:01.581 --> 08:04.083
with a little something,
and, uh, I just... I just...

08:04.083 --> 08:06.074
I'm afraid I'm begging
out of tonight, all right?

08:06.586 --> 08:07.587
Oh, I hardly think

08:07.587 --> 08:09.088
a little dinner will make you worse.

08:09.088 --> 08:10.556
And besides, we've
had a change of plans.

08:10.556 --> 08:12.558
Niles, for God sakes,
I just want to go home

08:12.558 --> 08:13.926
and get into bed.

08:13.926 --> 08:16.262
But Daphne and I have
put a lot of effort

08:16.262 --> 08:17.763
into making a very nice dinner.

08:17.763 --> 08:18.752
I can't help it if I'm sick.

08:19.265 --> 08:21.256
What if I catch pneumonia?

08:23.000 --> 08:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:30.643 --> 08:32.712
If that's what you wear to the movies,

08:32.712 --> 08:36.716
it's your own damn fault.

08:36.716 --> 08:38.083
What the hell are you doing here?

08:38.083 --> 08:39.552
My oven's on the fritz.

08:39.552 --> 08:41.187
We left you a message hours ago.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.587
Oh, I'm sorry, Niles.

08:42.587 --> 08:44.078
Um, you remember Julia, of course.

08:46.726 --> 08:48.594
Well, if he didn't before,
he certainly will now.

08:48.594 --> 08:50.596
Excuse me.

08:50.596 --> 08:51.597
You lied to me.

08:51.597 --> 08:52.598
Oh, I'm sorry.

08:52.598 --> 08:54.600
Would you have rather I told you

08:54.600 --> 08:56.102
that I was inflagrante delicto?

08:56.102 --> 08:57.262
No, no.

08:57.737 --> 08:59.105
But you're still not
excused from dinner.

08:59.105 --> 09:01.096
Julia and I will delighted to attend.

09:01.607 --> 09:03.109
We weren't planning on including Julia.

09:03.109 --> 09:04.098
Well, what do you want me to do,

09:04.610 --> 09:05.611
give her 50 bucks and
tell her to beat it?

09:05.611 --> 09:07.113
Oh.

09:07.113 --> 09:08.614
Ten years?

09:08.614 --> 09:10.616
I... If I still needed
a cane after that long,

09:10.616 --> 09:12.118
I'd dump my physical therapist

09:12.118 --> 09:15.621
and find one who knows
what they're doing.

09:15.621 --> 09:17.612
Hello.

09:18.124 --> 09:19.113
Well, actually, this is her.

09:19.625 --> 09:21.127
She's also my
daughter-in-law.

09:21.127 --> 09:21.991
Daphne, this is Julia.

09:22.595 --> 09:24.664
Sorry about that. I...

09:24.664 --> 09:25.665
That's all right.

09:25.665 --> 09:26.962
And just so you know,

09:27.667 --> 09:28.968
more. he wouldn't need the
can e so much if he'd stretch

09:28.968 --> 09:30.670
I would have thought
that part of your job

09:30.670 --> 09:31.671
was making sure he stretched.

09:31.671 --> 09:32.972
Yes, but...

09:32.972 --> 09:34.674
I can't be her e day and night.

09:34.674 --> 09:35.975
Oh.

09:35.975 --> 09:37.977
I'm sorry. For some reason
I thought you lived here.

09:37.977 --> 09:39.968
Well, I don't.

09:42.915 --> 09:46.619
How about some Mozart to
makes things festive, hmm?

09:46.619 --> 09:47.920
(music plays)

09:47.920 --> 09:49.622
Ah.

09:49.622 --> 09:51.817
Well, I'm not sure
I'd call that festive.

09:52.258 --> 09:53.759
Well, then, you'd be wrong,

09:53.759 --> 09:57.196
as it is from the
Salzburg Music Festival.

09:57.196 --> 09:59.198
How about something a
little more contemporary?

09:59.198 --> 10:00.600
Well, all right. I believe I have...

10:00.600 --> 10:02.602
Oh, Michael's Nyman's
The Contemporary Trumpet.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.604
What are you, a hundred?

10:04.604 --> 10:06.739
All right.

10:06.739 --> 10:08.040
Nothing then, my little wasp.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.742
(laughs)

10:09.742 --> 10:12.044
Oh, thank you, Niles.
Thank you very much.

10:12.044 --> 10:12.738
go. There you

10:13.045 --> 10:15.748
Oh, perfect. Thank you.

10:15.748 --> 10:17.049
NILES: Oh, uh...

10:17.049 --> 10:18.718
Here you go. There you are.

10:18.718 --> 10:19.719
She took my... Just take it.

10:19.719 --> 10:20.708
Just take it. She took my...

10:21.020 --> 10:22.888
I don't care. Just take it.

10:22.888 --> 10:24.719
She, uh...

10:25.224 --> 10:26.726
shoots from the hip, this one.

10:26.726 --> 10:28.216
(laughs): Yes.

10:28.728 --> 10:29.729
You should hear what
she says about my show.

10:29.729 --> 10:31.219
Oh, I just have to
remind Mr. Pompous here

10:31.731 --> 10:33.733
that what we do on the
radio is entertainment.

10:33.733 --> 10:35.668
Well... NILES: Yes, Frasier

10:35.668 --> 10:37.770
and I have had many a
chat about the difference

10:37.770 --> 10:39.071
between what he does
and genuine psychiatry.

10:39.071 --> 10:40.773
Yeah, big difference.

10:40.773 --> 10:42.070
I mean, at least his advice is free,

10:42.775 --> 10:43.776
not like those quacks

10:43.776 --> 10:45.073
who charge people 200 bucks an hour

10:45.778 --> 10:47.079
to whine about their childhoods.

10:47.079 --> 10:49.775
I mean, what a racket that is.

10:52.084 --> 10:54.382
Frasier, may I see you in the kitchen?

11:00.059 --> 11:02.061
Frasier. What are you
doing in the kitchen?

11:02.061 --> 11:03.729
You just asked to see me.

11:03.729 --> 11:07.700
Ah. So you haven't gone deaf.

11:07.700 --> 11:08.792
Why would I have gone deaf?

11:09.301 --> 11:10.302
Because that's the only good reason

11:10.302 --> 11:13.172
you sat there silently while
our profession was assaulted

11:13.172 --> 11:16.664
Like  a drag queen at a tractor pull.

11:16.976 --> 11:18.068
Niles, don't be so sensitive.

11:18.778 --> 11:20.079
That is one of the
qualities I admire most

11:20.079 --> 11:22.013
about Julia-- her
bracing frankness.

11:22.715 --> 11:23.716
Now, listen, listen. What?

11:23.716 --> 11:25.707
It is partially because of your advice

11:26.018 --> 11:28.187
that I have chosen to
commit myself to this woman,

11:28.187 --> 11:30.056
so please, at least give her a chance.

11:30.056 --> 11:33.259
You're right. If
you're happy, I'm happy.

11:33.259 --> 11:34.794
Ah, thanks.

11:34.794 --> 11:37.092
Help me serve. Right. Right. Okay.

11:37.797 --> 11:40.132
Dinner is served, everyone.

11:40.132 --> 11:42.134
If you'd come and take a seat.

11:42.134 --> 11:44.125
Here we are. Daph,
why don't you sit here

11:44.804 --> 11:48.140
Julia, have a seat there,
and I'll sit right next to you

11:48.140 --> 11:49.141
NILES: Thanks, Dad.

11:49.141 --> 11:51.811
And before we begin,

11:51.811 --> 11:54.013
I would like to share
some words of Robert Burns

11:54.013 --> 11:57.483
which have recently become
quite meaningful to me.

11:57.483 --> 12:00.986
"Beneath the shelter
of an aged tree... "

12:00.986 --> 12:02.488
(cell phone ringing) Whoops. That's me.

12:02.488 --> 12:03.989
Hello?

12:03.989 --> 12:05.491
Hey. What's up?

12:05.491 --> 12:07.482
No, no, I can talk.

12:08.494 --> 12:10.362
Well, what kind of crap is that?

12:10.362 --> 12:11.831
Nail their asses to the wall.

12:11.831 --> 12:13.032
Is that chicken?

12:13.032 --> 12:14.260
No, partridge.

12:14.800 --> 12:15.892
Yes, in a champagne and orange sauce.

12:16.202 --> 12:18.204
'Cause he's a pissy
little bitch, that's why.

12:18.204 --> 12:21.907
I'm sorry. I don't eat birds
They live in their own feces.

12:21.907 --> 12:23.898
More for me.

12:24.210 --> 12:26.212
I'll just get some cereal.

12:26.212 --> 12:27.913
Well, let him sue.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.215
got I'm starting to think you've

12:29.215 --> 12:31.917
a little pair of panties
on under that suit.

12:31.917 --> 12:36.222
You know, she really does work too hard.

12:36.222 --> 12:37.790
Back to what I was saying.

12:37.790 --> 12:39.792
"Beneath the shelter
of an aged tree... "

12:39.792 --> 12:41.093
JULIA: Okay,

12:41.093 --> 12:42.795
I give up-- where do
you keep your cereal?

12:42.795 --> 12:44.096
(chuckles) : Please, Julia, sit.

12:44.096 --> 12:46.098
We'll find you something.

12:46.098 --> 12:47.099
Oh, are you sure?

12:47.099 --> 12:48.801
"Beneath the shelter of an aged... "

12:48.801 --> 12:49.460
Niles.

12:53.005 --> 12:54.996
Let's not do this
tonight-- not with her here.

12:55.508 --> 12:56.497
I want it to be perfect.

12:57.009 --> 12:59.512
You're right. We'll just...
We'll just pick a better moment.

12:59.512 --> 13:00.513
I'll still be pregnant tomorrow.

13:00.513 --> 13:02.014
Exactly.

13:02.014 --> 13:03.504
Well, congratulations, Niles.

13:04.016 --> 13:07.019
Frasier didn't tell me
that Daphne was pregnant.

13:07.019 --> 13:08.521
What?

13:08.521 --> 13:09.522
She is?

13:09.522 --> 13:11.012
Oh, no, don't tell me

13:11.524 --> 13:13.014
she's just paunchy.

13:14.527 --> 13:16.529
She's not paunchy. She's pregnant!

13:16.529 --> 13:18.019
Niles!

13:20.466 --> 13:21.967
How could you do that?

13:21.967 --> 13:23.469
JULIA: I'm sorry.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.471
It's my fault. I heard
you in the kitchen.

13:25.471 --> 13:26.972
I didn't realize it was a big deal.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.974
Well, what does it matter

13:28.974 --> 13:30.976
how we came to know this glorious news?

13:30.976 --> 13:32.478
Niles! It's just wonderful !

13:32.478 --> 13:33.979
Two words: C-section.

13:33.979 --> 13:35.481
My sister's about your size,

13:35.481 --> 13:38.473
and when she had her kid,
it blew out the whole region.

13:46.559 --> 13:47.924
Can I have cereal, too?

13:52.298 --> 13:54.333
So, the more pregnantshegets,

13:54.333 --> 13:56.335
the more the husband hits on me .

13:56.335 --> 13:58.304
And by the way, she was a model.

13:58.304 --> 13:59.305
(phone rings)

13:59.305 --> 14:00.306
Whoops.

14:00.306 --> 14:01.841
That's me.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.176
Hello? Hey, how you doing?

14:04.176 --> 14:07.873
No, I'm just... meeting
my boyfriend's family.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.153
Isn't this fun?

14:20.125 --> 14:21.994
I'm having a good time.

14:21.994 --> 14:23.484
It's fun, isn't it?

14:24.964 --> 14:28.297
She certainly takes a lot
of calls at dinnertime.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.603
You know, that's exactly
the kind of... flaw

14:30.603 --> 14:32.104
that the old Frasier would have...

14:32.104 --> 14:34.607
seized upon as pretext
to end the relationship,

14:34.607 --> 14:36.598
but I-I know now that...
that impulse to run

14:37.109 --> 14:39.111
is-is really an indication
that my feelings for her

14:39.111 --> 14:40.601
are just deepening, and, um...

14:44.350 --> 14:45.351
Gone are the days

14:45.351 --> 14:47.653
when I would have said something like...

14:47.653 --> 14:49.288
(exhales sharply)

14:49.288 --> 14:50.983
"How rude. "

14:53.292 --> 14:54.987
Or "She's horrible.

14:55.294 --> 14:57.990
I've made a ghastly, ghastly mistake. "

15:02.001 --> 15:04.003
Hey, Marty, you're a Mariners fan.

15:04.003 --> 15:05.994
They won in the tenth on a grand slam.

15:11.043 --> 15:12.044
Who's ready to play

15:12.044 --> 15:13.545
that game of Pictionary we talked about?

15:13.545 --> 15:14.914
I know I am.

15:14.914 --> 15:15.347
(forced laughter)

15:15.347 --> 15:16.336
Let me... just get that.

15:16.982 --> 15:18.017
Dad, I'll tell you what.

15:18.017 --> 15:19.985
I know how much you like to keep time,

15:19.985 --> 15:20.974
so you'll be the timer,

15:21.353 --> 15:23.355
and then, it'll be me and Julia

15:23.355 --> 15:26.017
versus Niles and Daphne. How about that?

15:26.325 --> 15:27.960
Oh, that sounds good to me.

15:27.960 --> 15:29.962
FRASIER: Daphne, what do
you say you draw first?

15:29.962 --> 15:30.951
Okay.

15:33.232 --> 15:34.597
Mm-hmm. All right.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.101
Oh, boy.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.436
(chuckles)

15:37.436 --> 15:39.104
Okay.

15:39.104 --> 15:42.130
Ready, set... go.

15:46.512 --> 15:48.070
The Ring of the Nibelungen.

15:48.180 --> 15:49.682
Right! Damn!

15:49.682 --> 15:50.983
Wow!

15:50.983 --> 15:53.018
Well... congratulations, you two.

15:53.018 --> 15:54.019
(forced laughter)

15:54.019 --> 15:55.008
Great.

15:55.387 --> 15:56.388
All right, enough of that.

15:56.388 --> 15:58.023
Get your head in the game.

15:58.023 --> 15:59.024
We're starting from behind.

15:59.024 --> 16:01.026
Right, right. Okay, here we go.

16:01.026 --> 16:02.394
Now...

16:02.394 --> 16:04.029
Yeah.

16:04.029 --> 16:05.397
All right.

16:05.397 --> 16:07.399
Okay, Dad.

16:07.399 --> 16:08.297
Go.

16:09.101 --> 16:10.602
JULIA: A ball, a balloon.

16:10.602 --> 16:12.160
Oh, an apple!

16:13.238 --> 16:14.227
Uh, the circle of life.

16:15.741 --> 16:17.072
Uh, I don't know.

16:18.544 --> 16:20.145
Yeah, I'm looking at it.

16:20.145 --> 16:21.580
Maybe if you point
at it harder, I'll get it

16:21.580 --> 16:23.082
Give me something to work with, dummy.

16:23.082 --> 16:25.117
Oh, a hat!

16:25.117 --> 16:26.151
Oh, the Cat in the Hat!

16:26.151 --> 16:27.987
Uh, Abraham Lincoln!

16:27.987 --> 16:29.154
Time.

16:29.154 --> 16:30.656
(screeching): Oh,From Here to Eternity!

16:30.656 --> 16:31.645
I got that in!

16:34.059 --> 16:35.761
No, that's, that'? not it. Uh...

16:35.761 --> 16:37.529
What the hell is it?

16:37.529 --> 16:42.626
It's a cherry with a mustache,
and, uh, wearing a sombrero.

16:43.168 --> 16:45.568
It's "Cherry Garcia. "

16:51.276 --> 16:53.267
Oh, my God, that is the
worst drawing I've ever seen.

16:53.779 --> 16:54.268
I mean, even these cheaters

16:54.780 --> 16:55.781
wouldn't have gotten that one.

16:55.781 --> 16:57.182
Cheaters?

16:57.182 --> 16:58.817
I saw you guys mouthing at each other.

16:58.817 --> 16:59.818
And I think Father Time here

16:59.818 --> 17:01.820
cut us off a little early, too.

17:01.820 --> 17:04.323
Here, give me that pen.
I'll show you how it's done.

17:04.323 --> 17:05.824
Sit down.

17:05.824 --> 17:07.815
Oh, my God, I mean,
this painting is j...

17:09.627 --> 17:12.131
(choking)

17:12.131 --> 17:15.224
(continues choking and coughing)

17:20.539 --> 17:22.336
Oh, dear God!

17:23.442 --> 17:24.843
Are you all right?

17:24.843 --> 17:26.845
Oh... yes, I just...

17:26.845 --> 17:28.347
(coughs)

17:28.347 --> 17:30.338
I think I need to splash a
little cold water on my face.

17:30.849 --> 17:32.351
Let me just, uh, walk
you to the powder room.

17:32.351 --> 17:33.340
I'm sorry.

17:33.852 --> 17:35.354
Well, that's, uh, that's okay.

17:35.354 --> 17:37.845
You just take as long as you need.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.726
Shame on you!

17:46.498 --> 17:48.500
That woman couldn'tbreathe,

17:48.500 --> 17:51.503
and the three of you just sat there!

17:51.503 --> 17:53.806
You didn't exactly jump in yourself.

17:53.806 --> 17:55.603
That's because I mistook her choking

17:56.175 --> 17:58.541
for a sarcastic comment
on my Pictionary play!

17:58.977 --> 18:00.112
You, on the other hand,

18:00.112 --> 18:02.103
were content to let the woman
I love die before your eyes.

18:02.481 --> 18:04.176
That's right! I said I love her !

18:06.185 --> 18:07.352
Oh, knock it off, Frasier.

18:07.352 --> 18:08.754
You don't love her

18:08.754 --> 18:10.255
You're just trying to talk yourself

18:10.255 --> 18:12.553
into honoring your
ill-advised commitment.

18:12.825 --> 18:15.127
How dare you presume to know
the workings of my heart?

18:15.127 --> 18:16.495
You can't understand
the kind of feelings

18:16.495 --> 18:17.863
Julia and I have for one another.

18:17.863 --> 18:20.132
You may as well ask me
to describe the essence

18:20.132 --> 18:22.501
of music or the, the
col or of starlight!

18:22.501 --> 18:23.934
Nice towels, Frasier.

18:24.436 --> 18:27.337
You'd think a couple of
old ladies lived here.

18:27.673 --> 18:29.470
Get out.

18:32.511 --> 18:34.246
Excuse me?

18:34.246 --> 18:36.237
I said get out!

18:36.615 --> 18:38.884
I'm sorry. Have you just lost your mind?

18:38.884 --> 18:42.187
No. That happened earlier
when we slept together.

18:42.187 --> 18:43.484
Are you breaking up with me?

18:43.856 --> 18:45.524
You're damn right I am!

18:45.524 --> 18:46.792
I want my purse.

18:46.792 --> 18:49.352
And I, my hand towel.

18:51.430 --> 18:53.432
I can't believe this.

18:53.432 --> 18:55.934
You're actually kicking me out ?

18:55.934 --> 18:59.392
Do you want me to draw you a picture?

18:59.404 --> 19:00.803
We'd be here all night!

19:01.206 --> 19:02.230
Get out!

19:08.547 --> 19:10.182
(pouring)

19:10.182 --> 19:11.617
With this bottle, I would like to both

19:11.617 --> 19:14.153
commemorate and apologize
for this evening.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.142
Daphne, Niles,

19:15.554 --> 19:17.456
this should have been your evening,

19:17.456 --> 19:19.720
and I selfishly monopolized
every moment of it.

19:19.925 --> 19:22.758
Frasier... Not yet, Niles.

19:23.195 --> 19:25.459
Anyway,

19:25.931 --> 19:28.491
I handled things badly...

19:28.934 --> 19:30.936
both with Julia and with you,

19:30.936 --> 19:32.938
and I just hope that you can forgive me.

19:32.938 --> 19:34.606
Of course we will.

19:34.606 --> 19:36.341
Oh, look on the bright side.

19:36.341 --> 19:38.172
You could've let her choke to death,

19:38.777 --> 19:40.078
but you didn't

19:40.078 --> 19:42.911
Well, then, uh, to life,
both the old and the new.

19:42.948 --> 19:44.216
(all chuckling)

19:44.216 --> 19:45.513
Ah.

19:49.221 --> 19:51.623
Niles, I'm so proud of you.

19:51.623 --> 19:52.521
Thank you.

19:52.958 --> 19:54.960
I'm excited for you , Daphne .

19:54.960 --> 19:57.462
Takes me back to when I had my kids.

19:57.462 --> 19:59.965
What are you hoping for, boy or girl?

19:59.965 --> 20:00.966
Oh, I don't know.

20:00.966 --> 20:02.968
Be sort of nice to have a boy.

20:02.968 --> 20:03.969
Niles,

20:03.969 --> 20:05.459
just look at the edging on this.

20:05.971 --> 20:07.461
Have you ever? Have you ever?

20:07.973 --> 20:09.474
And look at... this
is all hand-stitched.

20:09.474 --> 20:10.976
Mm-hmm.
