11:54.330 --> 11:55.980
A free life.

11:59.370 --> 12:01.550
But if you want to run,

12:01.740 --> 12:04.120
you have to leave now, tonight.

12:04.320 --> 12:07.550
Run? With two kids and no money?

12:09.170 --> 12:10.380
How am I supposed to do that?

12:10.580 --> 12:12.550
Where would we even go, Gustavo?

12:14.170 --> 12:15.780
What do you want, Xiamara?

12:15.980 --> 12:17.220
Tell me.

12:17.420 --> 12:21.620
"Want" is a luxury
I don't even recognize.

12:21.820 --> 12:24.430
This is about need, now.

12:24.630 --> 12:28.050
I'm not running, and I am not
going into witness protection.

12:31.090 --> 12:34.990
What I need is a life.

12:37.060 --> 12:40.720
A regular, boring life.

12:45.930 --> 12:49.420
And you're going to figure out
how to make that happen for us.

12:53.560 --> 12:54.860
<i>HAVEMEYER:</i>
<i>What made you do that?</i>

12:55.060 --> 12:57.120
Follow Gustavo
after you got back?

12:57.320 --> 13:00.050
I just thought, what would
I do if I were them?

13:00.250 --> 13:03.190
Give the trained officer
a wide berth,

13:03.390 --> 13:04.780
follow the Mexican.

13:04.980 --> 13:06.870
Good news is,

13:07.070 --> 13:09.060
we know who we're dealing with.

13:09.260 --> 13:10.870
Bad news is, we know
who we're dealing with.

13:11.070 --> 13:12.010
[sighs]

13:12.210 --> 13:14.720
HAVEMEYER:
He doesn't look European.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.360
What do you know?

13:16.560 --> 13:18.880
He's maybe Central American.

13:19.080 --> 13:20.680
Definitely KGB.

13:20.880 --> 13:22.040
You think it started with Avi?

13:22.240 --> 13:23.140
It's a good bet.

13:23.340 --> 13:24.140
HAVEMEYER:
How long do you think

13:24.340 --> 13:26.720
they've been working Gustavo?

13:26.920 --> 13:28.550
The way it went down,
you meet in a crowded bar.

13:28.750 --> 13:29.630
I'm thinking
that's the initial approach.

13:29.830 --> 13:31.070
But if I'm being honest,

13:31.270 --> 13:33.570
Gustavo's been a little off
the last month or so.

13:33.770 --> 13:34.740
You think he's turned?

13:34.940 --> 13:36.910
I don't know.

13:38.740 --> 13:40.420
Let me figure it out.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.990
Until then, I think we just
play it close to the vest.

13:43.190 --> 13:45.420
Can you get surveillance
up on the residence

13:45.620 --> 13:47.170
without telling
Langley too much?

13:47.370 --> 13:48.820
You want to get in there?

13:50.100 --> 13:51.430
<i>CISSY:</i>
<i>No, Franklin.</i>

13:51.630 --> 13:54.520
- No?
- We had this conversation
before, remember?

13:54.720 --> 13:56.110
I didn't run then,
and I'm not running now.

13:56.310 --> 13:58.090
- But that was different.
- Was it?

13:58.290 --> 14:00.180
Those were gangbangers
who couldn't shoot straight.

14:00.380 --> 14:02.110
- I'm not asking you...
- How you doing, Father?

14:02.310 --> 14:03.580
There's more where
that came from.

14:03.780 --> 14:04.770
Just let me know, okay?

14:04.970 --> 14:06.240
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

14:06.440 --> 14:07.840
[baby crying]

14:08.040 --> 14:10.280
You think I'm overreacting?

14:10.480 --> 14:11.760
That he won't come for you?

14:11.960 --> 14:14.680
Let him come. I'll be here.

14:14.880 --> 14:17.030
Hey, he's not just gonna
walk through the door.

14:17.230 --> 14:18.510
I mean, you know who they are.
You know what they do.

14:18.710 --> 14:19.960
Oh, really?

14:20.160 --> 14:23.510
[scoffs] Mom, what are you,
some kind of martyr now?

14:23.710 --> 14:26.000
Oh, what?
This all your fault, huh?

14:27.000 --> 14:28.800
You need to die? Why?

14:29.000 --> 14:30.620
Because you didn't disown me
for slinging that shit?

14:30.820 --> 14:31.800
Watch your mouth.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.010
'Cause you helped me,
took the money,

14:34.210 --> 14:35.390
built a business,

14:35.590 --> 14:37.630
enjoyed living your life
for a change?

14:41.110 --> 14:42.460
Yes.

14:44.360 --> 14:46.880
Hey, mama. Hey.

14:47.080 --> 14:48.060
Yeah?

14:48.260 --> 14:49.810
- See if you can keep this down.
- Mm-hmm.

14:51.680 --> 14:54.020
And then I'll get you
a cot, all right?

14:55.510 --> 14:57.550
I don't want a bed.

14:57.750 --> 15:00.170
Bastards can't keep
their hands to themselves.

15:00.370 --> 15:01.980
All right. I'll put
a cot in the office.

15:02.180 --> 15:03.470
Lock the door behind me.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.970
Nobody'll bother you. Okay?

15:16.050 --> 15:18.340
FRANKLIN:
We're this close...

15:18.550 --> 15:20.490
this close to changing
the fate and fortune

15:20.680 --> 15:23.660
of this bloodline
for generations.

15:23.860 --> 15:26.990
Do I need to remind you
where you was at?

15:28.270 --> 15:30.930
What the future looked like?

15:31.130 --> 15:32.270
You, about to drop dead

15:32.470 --> 15:34.880
on the stairs
of one of Tulfowitz's buildings,

15:35.080 --> 15:38.690
and I don't even know how
I would've paid for the funeral.

15:40.070 --> 15:42.420
And how is this life
any better than that?

15:46.390 --> 15:48.820
Listen to me.
I love you.

15:49.020 --> 15:50.180
Okay?

15:51.700 --> 15:53.690
Please.

15:53.890 --> 15:55.530
Do this for me.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.630
[helicopter distantly whirring]

16:20.730 --> 16:22.220

[sighs heavily]

16:38.960 --> 16:40.410
[truck engine shuts off]

16:47.100 --> 16:48.420
Hey.

16:48.620 --> 16:50.140
What's going on?

16:51.690 --> 16:55.590
[sighs] So, I don't
know where to start.

16:56.630 --> 16:59.760
So, listen, two nights ago,

16:59.960 --> 17:01.670
when we got back
from Costa Rica,

17:01.870 --> 17:04.280
Xiamara and I had a fight, okay?

17:04.480 --> 17:06.130
I left. I went to a bar.

17:06.330 --> 17:07.760
And while I was there,
I was approached

17:07.960 --> 17:09.250
by the man in the sketch.

17:09.450 --> 17:11.480
<i>Sepa la chingada</i>
how he found me.

17:11.680 --> 17:14.030
He knew everything
I'd been doing with you.

17:14.230 --> 17:16.570
He threatened me and my family
if I didn't help him.

17:16.770 --> 17:17.860
Help him do what?

17:19.310 --> 17:21.520
He wanted proof that
you've been selling cocaine

17:21.720 --> 17:22.560
to finance a war.

17:22.760 --> 17:24.010
So we need
to move everything

17:24.210 --> 17:26.010
out of the warehouse, right now.

17:26.210 --> 17:27.270
- The cocaine and the money...
- No, I will, I will.

17:27.470 --> 17:28.790
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Everything. No, it's...

17:28.990 --> 17:30.100
- Just relax.
- They could be following us.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.530
There's nobody following you.

17:31.730 --> 17:34.220
- These guys, they work alone.
- What?

17:34.420 --> 17:36.700
KGB illegals. Always alone.

17:38.050 --> 17:39.020
[sighs]

17:39.220 --> 17:41.190
I already moved the cocaine.

17:43.060 --> 17:44.280
When?

17:44.480 --> 17:46.150
Well, last night,
after I followed the man

17:46.350 --> 17:49.650
in the sketch home from the bar,
after he approached you.

17:58.930 --> 18:01.310
It's very good
that you told me, Gustavo.

18:03.560 --> 18:05.660
It's very, very good.

18:08.770 --> 18:11.360
Where did you say
you are originally from?

18:11.560 --> 18:13.360
Uh, Montana.

18:13.560 --> 18:16.660
[chuckles] I'm just kidding.
We're from Detroit.

18:16.860 --> 18:20.320
Oh, of course. You all have
quite the sense of humor.

18:20.520 --> 18:23.270
[laughs] This place
is so lovely.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.030
We've been looking at homes
for a while now,

18:25.230 --> 18:27.330
but I think,
I think this is the one.

18:27.530 --> 18:28.530
Hello, there, Mrs. Cooper.

18:28.740 --> 18:29.520
You don't mind if
I steal your daughter

18:29.720 --> 18:31.520
a moment longer, do you?

18:31.720 --> 18:33.450
Oh, you can have her.

18:33.650 --> 18:34.850
[chuckles] The paperwork
won't take long.

18:35.050 --> 18:36.340
Please make yourself at home.

18:36.540 --> 18:38.940
- Everyone is very friendly.
- Oh, that's good.

18:39.140 --> 18:40.530
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you. [chuckles]

18:43.940 --> 18:46.700
Shit.

19:57.290 --> 19:58.850
How much do we need to worry?

19:59.850 --> 20:01.200
I'm keeping an eye on it.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.680
[phone ringing]

He moved the product.

20:12.230 --> 20:14.870
What are you talking about? Why?

20:15.070 --> 20:17.350
He's worried the KGB is onto us.

20:26.560 --> 20:28.190
[horse whinnies in distance]

20:28.390 --> 20:30.360
[indistinct chatter]

20:36.160 --> 20:37.230
Yo, this is the one.

20:37.430 --> 20:39.490
Got one of
the stablemen talking,

20:39.690 --> 20:41.170
said Louie rides
a couple times a week.

20:41.370 --> 20:42.510
What days?

20:42.710 --> 20:44.580
I don't know,
and it don't matter,

20:44.780 --> 20:46.380
because whenever
she do come through,

20:46.580 --> 20:48.040
y'all gonna be here.

20:48.240 --> 20:49.900
Sunup to sundown.

20:50.100 --> 20:51.560
Sunup?
What we look like, farmers?

20:51.760 --> 20:55.660
She does show up,
she might have security, right?

20:55.860 --> 20:57.510
Probably.

20:57.710 --> 20:59.080
Kane wants her alive.

20:59.280 --> 21:02.430
So do whatever y'all got to do
to make sure that happens.

[birds singing]

21:15.580 --> 21:18.030
You don't mind, do you?

21:19.890 --> 21:22.210
You can't smoke in here.

21:22.410 --> 21:24.940
Oh. No?

21:25.140 --> 21:26.850
Well, uh...

21:27.050 --> 21:28.820
I won't tell
if you won't tell.

21:29.020 --> 21:30.040
Mmm.

21:32.080 --> 21:33.770
You want one?

21:35.220 --> 21:37.050
Ask me why I'm in here.

21:37.250 --> 21:39.120
Okay.

21:39.320 --> 21:41.470
Why are you in here?

21:41.670 --> 21:44.180
Cancer. Down a lung.

21:44.380 --> 21:45.880
Mm.

21:47.160 --> 21:50.060
Well, I doubt one cigarette
is gonna cost you the other.

21:51.060 --> 21:52.650
It's your first day?

21:52.850 --> 21:56.620
Mm. First and last,
if it were up to me.

21:56.820 --> 21:59.000
But... [sighs]

21:59.200 --> 22:01.830
...there's no talking
any sense into my daughter.

22:02.030 --> 22:04.660
Not that I deserve any mercy
from her.

22:04.860 --> 22:06.900
Why do you say that?

22:07.800 --> 22:09.390
You got kids?

22:10.430 --> 22:12.320
- Two boys.
- Mm.

22:13.600 --> 22:14.900
Are y'all close?

22:15.100 --> 22:16.850
Mm-mm.

22:17.050 --> 22:20.090
Ah. Then I guess you
understand why.

22:24.160 --> 22:27.170
But still, you're, uh,
you're still pretty young

22:27.370 --> 22:28.650
to be in a place like this,
aren't you?

22:28.850 --> 22:31.260
[laughs] Ah.

22:31.460 --> 22:33.110
How many Black people
do you know?

22:33.310 --> 22:34.520
I'm sorry?

22:34.720 --> 22:36.780
Oh, well, obviously
not enough to know

22:36.980 --> 22:39.490
that we age like fine wine.

22:43.180 --> 22:44.840
Sorry, I am so rude.

22:45.040 --> 22:47.330
I just sat down here
and didn't introduce myself.

22:47.530 --> 22:48.850
I'm Penny.

Mac.

22:50.530 --> 22:53.300
I can't believe I'm gonna
spend my last lucid days

22:53.500 --> 22:55.060
in a place like this.

22:55.260 --> 22:58.510
Give it to me straight, Mac,
how bad is it here?

23:02.890 --> 23:06.830
I spent three months
as a POW during Korea.

23:07.030 --> 23:10.320
Below zero temps
in my birthday suit.

23:10.520 --> 23:13.150
I'd do another month
over one more day here.

23:13.350 --> 23:15.180
[scoffs] Oh.

23:16.490 --> 23:17.870
Oh...

23:20.880 --> 23:23.570
We can make a run for it,
if you want.

23:23.770 --> 23:25.970
Oh, yeah?

23:26.170 --> 23:28.230
We won't get far on foot.

23:35.370 --> 23:38.070
My daughter's gonna notice
they're gone soon.

23:38.270 --> 23:40.240
And when she does,
I don't want to be here.

23:40.440 --> 23:41.690
What about you?

23:44.760 --> 23:46.840
- JANIS: Is everything okay?
- [engine starts]

23:47.040 --> 23:48.700
VERONIQUE:
Mmm.

23:50.590 --> 23:52.490
Everything's perfect.

24:00.640 --> 24:01.660
You know, I tried to give

24:01.860 --> 24:02.830
this little
motherfucker a fair one.

24:03.030 --> 24:05.010
But now Leon gonna
get dealt with.

and tomorrow.

24:07.640 --> 24:08.980
- Ain't shit changed.
- Yeah.

24:09.180 --> 24:10.980
In the meantime, I expect you

24:11.180 --> 24:12.240
to starve his little ass out.

Be back in a couple days,
and so will you.

24:18.080 --> 24:19.900
With all due respect,
I ain't even talking to you.

24:20.100 --> 24:24.250
Now, nigga, I done did
right by you. Huh?

24:24.450 --> 24:26.220
Helped you set up
Franklin's two little bitches.

24:26.420 --> 24:28.030
Now you get to repay the favor.

24:28.230 --> 24:30.120
OG, you ain't get
your cut of that shit.

24:30.320 --> 24:31.950
Oh, I see.

24:32.950 --> 24:36.560
Niggas ain't got no more
fucking loyalty anymore? Huh?

24:36.760 --> 24:38.530
