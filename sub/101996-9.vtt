WITH A RECOVERY TEAM
COMBING THE OCEAN FLOOR

00:33.598 --> 00:35.818
FOR ANY SIGN OF YOU.

00:35.861 --> 00:38.473
SHE FOUND SOMETHING CAUGHT,
A PARIETAL SKULL BONE

00:38.516 --> 00:41.084
IN THE SHORES OUTSIDE
OF BLUDHAVEN,

00:41.128 --> 00:44.957
HAD 3 DIFFERENT LABS MATCH IT
TO YOUR DNA.

00:45.001 --> 00:47.873
IT WAS ENOUGH TO CONFIRM
YOU WERE GONE,

00:47.917 --> 00:51.094
AND SINCE I CAN'T EXACTLY
BE THERE TO SAY

00:51.138 --> 00:53.401

I'LL SAY IT HERE

01:02.584 --> 01:05.761
THIS PLANT WAS MY CONNECTION

01:05.804 --> 01:08.242
THEN IT TURNED OUT TO BE
MORE THAN A PLANT.

01:08.285 --> 01:10.331
IT'S A DESERT ROSE FROM CORYANA,

01:10.374 --> 01:12.115
PROBABLY SNUCK OVER
TO THE STATES

01:12.159 --> 01:13.856

01:16.119 --> 01:19.253
WHO THEN GAVE IT TO ME,
HAVING NO IDEA THAT ITS SERUM

01:19.296 --> 01:20.993
WAS ACTUALLY A MIRACLE CURE.

01:21.037 --> 01:23.648
LIKE YOU, THIS PLANT IS
ONE OF A KIND,

01:23.692 --> 01:27.174

A SECOND CHANCE.

03:29.165 --> 03:31.211
COMMISSIONER FORBES,
IT'S NOT NEWS

03:31.254 --> 03:33.213
THAT THE GCPD HAS BEEN
WORKING TIRELESSLY

03:33.256 --> 03:35.389
TO PUT SNAKEBITE DEALERS
BEHIND BARS,

03:35.432 --> 03:37.739

FROM BATWOMAN.

03:37.782 --> 03:39.436
-CAN YOU COMMENT?
-THERE'S NO QUESTION

03:39.480 --> 03:41.482
WE WILL PUT A STOP
TO SNAKEBITE

03:41.525 --> 03:44.267
AND ITS MANUFACTURERS,
THE FALSE FACE SOCIETY,

03:44.311 --> 03:46.574
BUT THIS DRUG,
IT HAS ITS TEETH
IN PEOPLE,

03:46.617 --> 03:49.707
IT'S ADDICTIVE,
IT'S SEXY,
AND IT'S LETHAL.

03:49.751 --> 03:51.883
THE LAST I CHECKED,
DANA, THE GCPD

03:51.927 --> 03:54.059
WAS NEVER ONE TO

EXTRA HELP

03:54.103 --> 03:55.626
FROM A VIGILANTE.

03:55.670 --> 03:59.326
NOW I HAVE A 10-HOUR
BUDGET MEETING
TO GET TO.

03:59.369 --> 04:01.980
I'M ACTUALLY HERE TO TALK
ABOUT THAT BUDGET MEETING,
COMMISSIONER.

04:02.024 --> 04:03.547
OH, GOODY.
LET ME GUESS--

04:03.591 --> 04:05.288
YOU WANT TO DEFUND
THE POLICE.

04:05.332 --> 04:07.334
DEFUNDING THE POLICE
MEANS REDUCING YOUR BUDGET

04:07.377 --> 04:10.511
IN AREAS LIKE OFFICER BONUSES
AND CANNABIS REGULATION

04:10.554 --> 04:12.861
AND REDISTRIBUTING
THE FUNDS TO THINGS
LIKE MENTAL HEALTH,

04:12.904 --> 04:14.297
EDUCATION, EMPLOYMENT,
HOUSING.

04:14.341 --> 04:16.386
WHERE DO YOU THINK
THE MONEY COMES FROM

04:16.430 --> 04:17.866
EVERY TIME WE HAVE TO CLEAN
A BUILDING

04:17.909 --> 04:19.607
YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS
GRAFFITI TAGS, HUH?

04:19.650 --> 04:22.000
GOT IT. SO SPRAY PAINT
WILL GET YOUR ATTENTION

04:22.044 --> 04:24.829
BUT NOT YOUR OWN OFFICERS

04:24.873 --> 04:26.309
THIS YEAR ALONE?

04:26.353 --> 04:28.137
IT'S AN ELECTED POSITION,
SWEETIE.

04:28.180 --> 04:30.487
YOU DON'T LIKE ME,
RUN.

04:41.019 --> 04:43.413
-MMM!
-RIGHT?

I'VE NEVER HAD
SWEET POTATO

THESE WOULD BE

-IT'S ALL ABOUT THE SKILLET.
-MMM.

04:52.422 --> 04:54.511
THANK YOU FOR THIS

04:54.555 --> 04:58.950
AND FOR LETTING ME CRY
AT ODD HOURS OF THE DAY

04:58.994 --> 05:01.997
AND LETTING ME FINISH
ALL THE ICE CREAM
IN THE FREEZER.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.912
I'M GONNA NEED THAT
REPLACED ACTUALLY.

05:03.955 --> 05:06.610
MMM. NO WAY.

05:06.654 --> 05:08.830
THESE PAST FEW WEEKS,
YOU KNOW,

05:08.873 --> 05:10.832
HAVE BEEN
REALLY, REALLY TOUGH,

05:10.875 --> 05:16.141

FEELS A LITTLE
LESS AWFUL

05:16.185 --> 05:19.275

05:19.319 --> 05:21.016

05:49.740 --> 05:52.395

HOPING WE COULD TALK.

05:52.439 --> 05:54.528
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT
TO TALK ABOUT.

05:54.571 --> 05:57.095
WELL, THEN MAYBE
JUST LISTEN

05:57.139 --> 05:59.489
BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO
SAY I'M SORRY.

05:59.533 --> 06:01.535
UH, OK.

06:01.578 --> 06:06.975
I AM GONNA TAKE THIS
AND THESE DOWNSTAIRS

06:07.018 --> 06:10.457
OUT OF EARSHOT...MAYBE.

06:20.554 --> 06:27.299
I, UH--I SAID SOME
PRETTY AWFUL THINGS

06:27.343 --> 06:28.823
WELL, I MEAN,
IN YOUR DEFENSE,

06:28.866 --> 06:31.956
YOU WERE IN THE PROCESS
OF DUMPING ME.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.132
RY, YOU WORKED
WITH THE CROWS TO
LOJACK MY PHONE.

06:34.176 --> 06:36.483
OK. I KNOW YOU DIDN'T
JUST COME ALL THIS WAY

06:38.006 --> 06:39.616
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN

CRAPPY GROUP HOME

06:41.618 --> 06:43.403
FEEL LIKE
A REAL HOME,

06:43.446 --> 06:44.839

ADOPTED YOU,

06:44.882 --> 06:47.624

ON MY OWN, CRUSHED

06:47.668 --> 06:49.278
BUT HAPPY FOR YOU.

07:02.596 --> 07:06.208

07:14.608 --> 07:16.261
YOU SAID YOU COULDN'T
GET OUT.

07:16.305 --> 07:17.611
NO. I SAID
I DIDN'T WANT TO,

07:17.654 --> 07:19.308
BUT FALSE FACE
FOUND OUT THAT OCEAN

07:19.351 --> 07:21.441
TAUGHT ME HOW TO
MAKE SNAKEBITE,

07:21.484 --> 07:23.530

THEY WANTED ME TO
OPEN MY OWN LAB,

07:23.573 --> 07:26.533

07:26.576 --> 07:29.884

MY LIFE AROUND FOR.

07:36.368 --> 07:40.155
JUST THINK ABOUT IT

07:40.198 --> 07:43.419

MY MIND IS
ALREADY MADE UP.

07:59.609 --> 08:02.264
KATE KANE SAT ON A WALL.

08:04.092 --> 08:07.487
KATE KANE HAD A GREAT FALL.

08:11.839 --> 08:15.669

ALL THE WAY FROM CORYANA

08:29.726 --> 08:31.336
JUST TO DIE.

08:35.645 --> 08:37.212

08:43.653 --> 08:46.395
DON'T BE SILLY.
YOU INVITED ME FOR TEA.

09:05.632 --> 09:07.155
WE'VE GOT EXTRA EYES!

09:25.477 --> 09:27.523
COME ON!
WE GOT TO GO!

09:27.567 --> 09:29.786
WE'RE COMING FOR YOU!

09:39.970 --> 09:41.668

FORBES' CHALK OUTLINE

09:41.711 --> 09:44.279

09:53.593 --> 09:55.029

09:55.072 --> 09:56.726
A BUSINESSPERSON
TO STEP IN HERE,

09:56.770 --> 09:59.076
BUT I HAVE MADE A CAREER
OUT OF CONCEALING BLEMISHES,

09:59.120 --> 10:01.731
AND QUITE FRANKLY,
THE MAKEOVER THIS CITY NEEDS

10:01.775 --> 10:03.472
COMES FROM AN UGLY
I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE,

10:03.515 --> 10:06.910
SO, YES, I AM HERE

10:06.954 --> 10:08.346

10:12.699 --> 10:15.179
THEY ARE SCARED TO DEATH

10:20.576 --> 10:22.534
I'M HERE TO OFFER IT.

10:22.578 --> 10:26.016
TO THE LAW ENFORCEMENT
IN CHARGE OF PROTECTING US,

10:26.060 --> 10:28.236
WHAT CAN WE DO, HMM?

10:28.279 --> 10:31.674
HOW CAN WE HELP YOU?

10:31.718 --> 10:33.633
BECAUSE ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

10:34.808 --> 10:36.200
THE GANGS IN THE CITY
ARE STUPID

10:36.244 --> 10:38.159
BUT NOT KILL
THE COMMISSIONER STUPID.

10:38.202 --> 10:39.726
IT'S COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT
FORBES WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR.

10:39.769 --> 10:41.162
I WOULDN'T ELIMINATE
LADY SPITE KILLING.

10:41.205 --> 10:42.946
OR ANY RECENTLY
RELEASED INMATE

10:42.990 --> 10:45.079
WHO MAY FEEL LIKE
FORBES SCREWED
THEM OVER.

10:45.122 --> 10:47.734
LICENSE PLATES,
FACIAL REC.

10:47.777 --> 10:49.561
ANY VEHICLE THAT DIDN'T
STOP LONG ENOUGH

10:49.605 --> 10:52.086
AT A STOPLIGHT LAST NIGHT
GETS PUT THROUGH THE SYSTEM.

10:53.478 --> 10:55.045
-I DON'T GET IT.
-I THOUGHT HE WAS GUNNED DOWN

10:55.089 --> 10:56.830
-ON THOSE STEPS.
-HE WAS.

10:56.873 --> 10:59.136
WHERE THE HELL'S
THE COMMISSIONER?

10:59.180 --> 11:01.704
THERE'S NOTHING THERE.

11:01.748 --> 11:04.054
HANG ON. GO BACK.

11:05.621 --> 11:08.276
CHECK OUT
THE TIMESTAMP.

11:08.319 --> 11:10.713
SOMEONE SCRUBBED 5 MINUTES
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE MURDER.

11:10.757 --> 11:12.889
YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

11:14.804 --> 11:17.328
I WANT THE NAME
OF EVERYONE IN THIS CITY

11:17.372 --> 11:18.982
WITH ACCESS TO THIS FEED.

11:19.026 --> 11:20.810
SO WHOEVER
SHOT THE COMMISSIONER

11:20.854 --> 11:22.725
HAS ACCESS
TO THE CITY'S CCTV.

11:22.769 --> 11:24.422
THIS WAS A WELL-PLANNED
EXECUTION.

11:24.466 --> 11:26.033
WHOA, WHOA. WAIT.
REWIND AGAIN.

11:26.076 --> 11:28.426
LOOK AT THE FAR RIGHT
AFTER THE JUMP.

11:28.470 --> 11:29.732
SOMEONE TAGGED IT.

11:29.776 --> 11:30.994
CAN YOU GET A CLOSER
ANGLE AT THAT?

11:31.038 --> 11:32.822
-YEAH.
-SOMEONE COULD HAVE BEEN

11:32.866 --> 11:34.171
TAGGING THE BUILDING
WHILE THE SHOOTING
WAS HAPPENING.

11:34.215 --> 11:35.433
THEN GOT THE HELL
OUT OF DODGE,

11:35.477 --> 11:37.044
LEFT BEHIND WORK
IN PROGRESS.

11:37.087 --> 11:38.610
WHICH MEANS THE TAGGER
COULD HAVE SEEN THE SHOOTER.

11:38.654 --> 11:40.308
AND THE SHOOTER COULD
HAVE SEEN THEM,

11:40.351 --> 11:42.310
SO HOW DO WE TRACK DOWN
A POTENTIAL WITNESS

11:42.353 --> 11:43.790
AND PROTECT THEM SOLELY OFF
THE WORDS "DEFUND THE POLICE?"

11:43.833 --> 11:45.182
-I THINK I FOUND IT.
-LITERALLY HOW?

11:45.226 --> 11:47.054
SOCIAL MEDIA.
FIGURED THE "X"

11:47.097 --> 11:48.751
INSIDE THE "O"
AND MONOCHROME
ON TOP OF THE NEON

11:48.795 --> 11:50.274
WAS SOME SORT
OF SIGNATURE.

11:52.015 --> 11:53.800
DEFINITELY COULD BE
THE SAME ARTIST.

11:53.843 --> 11:55.627
I'LL GET
THE USER'S INFO.

11:55.671 --> 11:57.368
HEY!

11:57.412 --> 12:00.371
SO...WE JUST GONNA
ACT LIKE ANGELIQUE

12:00.415 --> 12:02.025
DIDN'T COME BY
YESTERDAY, OR--

12:02.069 --> 12:03.592
-YEP.
-WHOA. I THOUGHT THAT WAS OVER.

12:03.635 --> 12:06.682
IT WAS. MAJOR
DUMPER'S REMORSE.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.771
YOU WERE LISTENING?

12:08.815 --> 12:12.427
WELL, YOU KNOW, JUST
IN CASE I HAD TO
STEP IN AND DEFEND.

12:12.470 --> 12:15.778
SO SPILL.
WE TAKING HER BACK?

12:15.822 --> 12:18.346
I DON'T KNOW.

12:18.389 --> 12:20.043
I LOVE HER.

12:20.087 --> 12:23.394
SHE'S A HUGE PART
OF MY LIFE.

12:23.438 --> 12:25.396
BUT?

12:25.440 --> 12:27.094
HEY. I'M IN.

12:27.137 --> 12:29.139
SO NO REAL NAME.
IT'S SOMEONE'S FINSTA,

12:29.183 --> 12:30.575
BUT I MATCHED THE LOGIN
INFORMATION

12:30.619 --> 12:32.055
TO ANOTHER PROFILE.

12:33.491 --> 12:35.015
JORDAN MOORE.

12:35.058 --> 12:37.321
YOU DON'T THINK SHE'S
ANY RELATION TO...

12:37.365 --> 12:39.846
SIR, WHERE ARE YOU?

12:39.889 --> 12:41.761
THE COMMISSIONER
WAS ASSASSINATED,

12:41.804 --> 12:43.675
AND THAT POMPOUS ASS
ROMAN SIONIS

12:43.719 --> 12:46.069
IS GETTING MORE AIRTIME
THEN THE CROWS COMMANDER.

12:46.113 --> 12:48.811
MAYBE YOU SHOULD RELEASE
A STATEMENT OR SOMETHING.

12:48.855 --> 12:50.073
CALL ME!

12:55.513 --> 12:56.863
WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL?

12:56.906 --> 12:59.648
JORDAN! UHH.

12:59.691 --> 13:01.128
WHAT IS HAPPENING?

13:01.171 --> 13:03.260
I SAW COMMISSIONER FORBES
GET GUNNED DOWN.

13:03.304 --> 13:04.827
WHAT?!

13:04.871 --> 13:06.873
LOOK. I--I DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE ELSE TO GO.

13:06.916 --> 13:08.788
I'M--I'M SCARED
TO GO HOME.

13:08.831 --> 13:10.398
I FEEL LIKE I'M
BEING FOLLOWED.

13:10.441 --> 13:13.053
HEY, HEY. I GOT YOU.

13:13.096 --> 13:16.578
EVERYTHING'S GONNA
BE ALL RIGHT.

13:16.621 --> 13:18.536
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS.

13:18.580 --> 13:20.364
I'LL TAKE YOUR
WITNESS STATEMENT.

13:20.408 --> 13:24.107
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
I'M NOT GIVING MY NAME
TO THE CROWS.

13:24.151 --> 13:26.457
I MAY AS WELL JUST DO
A SIT-DOWN WITH
VESPER FAIRCHILD.

13:26.501 --> 13:29.330
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT A HUGE DEAL THIS IS?

13:29.373 --> 13:31.114
THERE'S NO OTHER
WITNESSES.

13:31.158 --> 13:33.856
I DON'T CARE.
THE CROWS DON'T KEEP
PEOPLE LIKE ME SAFE,

13:33.900 --> 13:36.772
AND YOU KNOW IT.

13:36.816 --> 13:40.254
I CAME TO SOPHIE,
MY SISTER, FOR HELP,

13:40.297 --> 13:42.430
NOT SOPHIE THE CROW.

13:43.953 --> 13:45.172
GET DOWN!

13:45.215 --> 13:46.521
TOLD YOU THEY WERE
FOLLOWING ME!

13:46.564 --> 13:47.870
WHO'S THEY?

13:47.914 --> 13:49.654
NOW IS WHEN YOU
PULL YOUR GUN!

14:08.543 --> 14:10.023
HUH!

14:10.066 --> 14:11.285
AGH!

14:16.420 --> 14:18.509
DAMN.

14:18.553 --> 14:20.163
YOU'RE BATWOMAN.

14:27.301 --> 14:29.564
IT'S FALSE FACE.

14:29.607 --> 14:31.566
SO THE COMMISSIONER'S
HOT TAKE ON SNAKEBITE

14:31.609 --> 14:32.784
GOT HIS ASS KILLED.

14:32.828 --> 14:34.438
HOW DID YOU KNOW
WE WERE HERE?

14:34.482 --> 14:36.136
JORDAN WASN'T
AT HER PLACE,

14:36.179 --> 14:38.355
SO I HOPED SHE WENT
TO HER SISTER FOR HELP.

14:38.399 --> 14:40.749
APPARENTLY FALSE FACE
HAD THE SAME IDEA.

14:40.792 --> 14:43.360
SORRY. H-HOW DO YOU
KNOW MY LIFE?

14:43.404 --> 14:45.319
I'VE SEEN YOUR SKILLS
AROUND GOTHAM,

14:45.362 --> 14:48.539
AND I KNOW YOU WERE TAGGING
CITY HALL LAST NIGHT.

14:48.583 --> 14:49.932
SERIOUSLY?

14:49.976 --> 14:51.586
GIRL, SO NOT
THE POINT RIGHT NOW.

14:51.629 --> 14:52.892
I NEED YOU
TO TELL ME

14:52.935 --> 14:54.197
EVERYTHING YOU SAW.

14:54.241 --> 14:55.720
YOU DON'T GET IT.
I SNITCH,

14:55.764 --> 14:57.505
IT COMES BACK
TO ME.

14:57.548 --> 14:59.028
THEY SAW ME THERE.
THEY'LL KNOW IT
WAS ME.

14:59.072 --> 15:00.464
THE COSTUME PARTY
ON THE GROUND TELLS ME.

15:00.508 --> 15:02.075
THEY ALREADY KNOW
IT WAS YOU.

15:04.164 --> 15:05.600
YOU CAN TRUST HER.

15:08.646 --> 15:10.822
THERE WERE 3 DUDES.

15:10.866 --> 15:12.215
TWO GOT OUT
OF THE CAR

15:12.259 --> 15:13.608
AND GUNNED DOWN
FORBES,

15:13.651 --> 15:15.001
ONE IN A GAS MASK

15:15.044 --> 15:16.219
AND ONE
IN A HOCKEY MASK

15:16.263 --> 15:17.699
AND THEN A DRIVER.

15:17.742 --> 15:19.092
WAS HE WEARING
A MASK?

15:19.135 --> 15:21.485
SHE. YES.
A--A BABY DOLL THING.

15:21.529 --> 15:24.358
SO IT COULD BE
LITERALLY ANYONE.

15:24.401 --> 15:26.751
IT ISN'T ENOUGH.

15:26.795 --> 15:29.580
YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK.
CONSIDER YOURSELF LUCKY.

15:29.624 --> 15:31.321
DON'T KNOW IF IT HELPS,
BUT I SAW

15:31.365 --> 15:33.106
THE DRIVER'S BRACELET.

15:33.149 --> 15:37.284
IT WAS A BIG GOLD KEY.
IT LOOKED RITZ.

15:37.327 --> 15:39.329
EVERYTHING OK?

15:39.373 --> 15:41.244
GET HER SOMEWHERE SAFE.

15:41.288 --> 15:42.985
I'LL FIGURE THIS OUT.

15:51.167 --> 15:54.083
YOU AND YOUR FRIEND
GO TELL YOUR BOSS
WE'RE GOOD HERE.

15:54.127 --> 15:56.129
THE GIRL WILL KEEP
HER MOUTH SHUT,

15:56.172 --> 15:58.174
AND YOU WILL LEAVE
HER ALONE.

16:01.482 --> 16:04.006
YOU'RE NOT REAL,
THIS TEA'S NOT REAL,

16:04.050 --> 16:06.400
AND THIS CUP
IS...NOT REAL.

16:06.443 --> 16:10.012
CORRECT, BUT YOU DON'T
WANT REALITY.

16:10.056 --> 16:12.841
THAT'S THE POINT.

16:12.884 --> 16:15.104
NO. I JUST SPENT
THE LAST TWO WEEKS

16:15.148 --> 16:16.758
IN THE BOWELS
OF A SHIP,

16:16.801 --> 16:19.021
TRYING TO ESCAPE
A GODFORSAKEN ISLAND.

16:19.065 --> 16:22.982
TRUST ME. IF I WERE
TO CONJURE UP
SOME FANTASY,

16:23.025 --> 16:25.332
THIS WOULD NOT BE IT.

16:25.375 --> 16:26.942
YOU MEAN THE SAME ISLAND

16:26.986 --> 16:28.030
YOU RISKED EVERYTHING

16:28.074 --> 16:29.118
TO GET TO IN ORDER TO

16:29.162 --> 16:30.598
SEE ME AGAIN?

16:30.641 --> 16:32.513
WELL, HERE WE ARE.

16:32.556 --> 16:34.689
OF COURSE. I ASK
THE UNIVERSE

16:34.732 --> 16:36.082
FOR MY SISTER,

16:36.125 --> 16:38.301
AND THIS IS
WHAT I GET.

16:38.345 --> 16:40.173
I'M NOT SURE WHY
THAT'S SURPRISING.

16:40.216 --> 16:42.740
YOU NEVER GET
WHAT YOU WANT.

16:42.784 --> 16:44.394
CHEERS TO THAT.

16:44.438 --> 16:46.570
NOTHING ABOUT YOUR PLAN
UNFOLDED THE WAY YOU WANTED.

16:46.614 --> 16:48.833
AFTER WE LEFT YOU IN THIS CELL
FOR 11 YEARS,

16:48.877 --> 16:50.139
YOU SET OUT TO MAKE SURE

16:50.183 --> 16:51.836
YOUR FAMILY NEVER LEFT
YOU AGAIN,

16:51.880 --> 16:53.708
BUT DAD HELPED LOCK YOU
AT ARKHAM,

16:53.751 --> 16:56.885
AND I'M DEAD.

16:56.928 --> 16:59.061
AM I SO MENTALLY
DISTURBED

16:59.105 --> 17:02.195
THAT MY IMAGINATION
CREATED YOU

17:02.238 --> 17:03.848
TO RUB IT IN?

17:03.892 --> 17:05.850
YOU CREATED ME BECAUSE
YOU WERE ALWAYS THE ONE

17:05.894 --> 17:07.635
WHO GOT US INTO TROUBLE,

17:07.678 --> 17:09.724
BUT I WAS ALWAYS THE ONE
CLEVER ENOUGH

17:09.767 --> 17:11.552
TO GET US OUT OF IT.

17:11.595 --> 17:15.034
-WHAT TROUBLE?
-YOUR PAIN.

17:15.077 --> 17:16.383
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU
I HAD A WAY

17:16.426 --> 17:17.906
TO MAKE IT DISAPPEAR?

17:23.433 --> 17:26.088
ANG, OPEN UP.
IT'S ME.

17:26.132 --> 17:27.698
HEY.

17:27.742 --> 17:30.179
YOU SAID YOU WERE
GETTING OUT, ANG!

17:30.223 --> 17:33.226
OK. YOUR ENERGY IS
SUPERINTENSE RIGHT NOW.

17:33.269 --> 17:36.098
WHO KILLED
THE COMMISSIONER?

17:36.142 --> 17:37.926
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING

17:37.969 --> 17:40.320
DRIVING THE GETAWAY CAR?

17:40.363 --> 17:42.017
WHO ELSE KNOWS?

17:42.061 --> 17:43.801
THAT IS NOT
THE APPROPRIATE
RESPONSE

17:43.845 --> 17:45.064
TO WHAT I JUST SAID.

17:45.107 --> 17:46.500
YOU WANT ME TO
END UP DEAD?

17:46.543 --> 17:48.110
-WHO ELSE KNOWS?
-I DO!

17:48.154 --> 17:49.720
THAT SHOULD BE
ENOUGH!

17:52.941 --> 17:54.725
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
I WAS DOING THERE.

17:54.769 --> 17:56.640
I SAID I WANTED OUT,
AND THEY WERE WILLING
TO LET ME GO

17:56.684 --> 17:59.034
IF I JUST DID
THIS ONE LAST THING.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.297
THEY GAVE ME A MASK,
KEYS, AND AN ADDRESS.

18:01.341 --> 18:03.299
AM I SUPPOSED TO
BELIEVE YOU RIGHT NOW?

18:03.343 --> 18:05.432
WHEN HAVE I EVER LIED
TO YOU?

18:06.955 --> 18:08.435
IF MY NAME IS OUT,
FALSE FACE WILL KILL ME

18:08.478 --> 18:10.176
TO PROTECT THEMSELVES.

18:10.219 --> 18:11.699
THEN OUT THEM.

18:13.657 --> 18:15.268
TURN IN THE ACTUAL
KILLERS.

18:15.311 --> 18:17.008
TELL THE COURT WHAT
YOU JUST TOLD ME.

18:17.052 --> 18:19.054
YOU DIDN'T KNOW.

18:20.403 --> 18:23.232
FALSE FACE IS RUN
BY A PSYCHOPATH
NAMED BLACK MASK,

18:23.276 --> 18:25.278
WHO WILL LEAVE ME
FOR DEAD IN A SEWER

18:25.321 --> 18:27.541
BEFORE I EVER GET
ON A WITNESS STAND.

18:27.584 --> 18:29.717
I CAN PROTECT YOU.

18:29.760 --> 18:33.112
YOU? HOW?

18:34.809 --> 18:40.510
THIS IS GOING TO
SOUND...INSANE...

18:40.554 --> 18:41.990
BUT...

18:46.212 --> 18:47.735
I KNOW BATWOMAN.

18:50.216 --> 18:52.087
OK.

18:52.131 --> 18:56.004
HOW DO YOU THINK I KNOW
YOU GOT WRAPPED UP
IN THIS CRAP?

18:57.484 --> 19:00.008
YOU AND YOUR
COMIC BOOK HEROES.

19:00.051 --> 19:03.446
YEAH. WELL, THANKS
TO ME AND MY
COMIC BOOK HEROES,

19:03.490 --> 19:06.971
YOUR ASS HAS AN OUT
IF YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE IT,

19:07.015 --> 19:09.887
BUT YOU NEED TO TAKE IT.

19:09.931 --> 19:11.541
CAN I THINK
ABOUT IT?

19:14.501 --> 19:15.980
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU'RE LETTING HER
THINK ABOUT IT?

19:16.024 --> 19:18.331
SHE JUST GUNNED DOWN
THE COMMISSIONER.

19:18.374 --> 19:20.246
SHE DROVE
THE GETAWAY CAR.

19:20.289 --> 19:21.769
OH, RIGHT. SHE DIDN'T
PULL THE TRIGGER.

19:21.812 --> 19:23.423
SHE JUST STEPPED
ON THE GAS.

19:23.466 --> 19:24.946
YES. PLEASE GIVE HER
ALL THE TIME SHE NEEDS.

19:24.989 --> 19:26.339
RYAN'S RIGHT.
IF JORDAN TESTIFIES

19:26.382 --> 19:27.949
AGAINST FALSE FACE,
THEY'LL KILL HER,

19:27.992 --> 19:30.038
BUT IF ANGELIQUE DOES,
JORDAN DOESN'T HAVE TO.

19:30.081 --> 19:31.866
EXACTLY. ANG
JUST NEEDS TIME.

19:31.909 --> 19:33.346
SHE'LL MAKE
THE RIGHT DECISION.

19:33.389 --> 19:34.869
SHE COULD HAVE GONE
TO THE COPS

19:34.912 --> 19:36.523
WHEN YOU WERE BUSTED
FOR HER DRUGS ON YOU.

19:36.566 --> 19:38.612
-SHE DIDN'T.
-SHE'S CHANGED.

19:38.655 --> 19:40.179
YOU LITERALLY JUST
SAID THE WORDS,

19:40.222 --> 19:42.398
"SHE DROVE
THE GETAWAY CAR."

19:42.442 --> 19:45.749
OK. YOU HAVE
MY BACK, RIGHT?

19:49.362 --> 19:53.235
I'VE BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD
BEFORE WITH ANOTHER
BATWOMAN--KATE--

19:53.279 --> 19:54.932
AND SHE FOUND EVERY
EXCUSE IN THE BOOK

19:54.976 --> 19:56.717
TO JUSTIFY
HER TWIN SISTER'S ACTIONS,

19:56.760 --> 19:59.154
AND YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN
THE ONE TO REMIND ME

19:59.198 --> 20:00.721
THAT MY MOM DIED
BECAUSE OF IT.

20:00.764 --> 20:02.766
ANGELIQUE IS NOT ALICE.

20:02.810 --> 20:05.465
NO ONE IS EVER ALICE
UNTIL THEY ARE

20:05.508 --> 20:07.728
BECAUSE SOMEONE
LET THEM BE.

20:07.771 --> 20:11.732
MAYBE YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WAIT FOR ANGELIQUE
TO TURN HERSELF IN.

20:11.775 --> 20:14.430
YOU CAN DO THAT FOR HER.

20:14.474 --> 20:15.779
Y'ALL ARE SUPPOSED
TO BE MY TEAM.

20:15.823 --> 20:17.694
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WE ARE YOUR TEAM,

20:17.738 --> 20:20.654
WHICH MAKES YOU
OUR LEADER.

20:20.697 --> 20:24.571
THIS IS IT.
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
TO MAKE THE RIGHT CALL.

20:24.614 --> 20:28.270
I'LL GIVE ANGELIQUE
AN HOUR TO TALK,

20:28.314 --> 20:31.273
BUT AFTER THAT,
I'LL CALL THE COPS MYSELF.

20:47.942 --> 20:49.117
NO. I PERSONALLY
NEVER THOUGHT SAFIYAH

20:49.160 --> 20:51.337
WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR
KATE'S PLANE BLOWING UP.

20:51.380 --> 20:52.860
NOT HER M.O.

20:52.903 --> 20:55.689
THE NTSB CONCLUDED
THAT BASED ON THE WEATHER

20:55.732 --> 20:57.647
AND THE ATMOSPHERE IT WAS
LIKELY A LIGHTNING STRIKE

20:57.691 --> 20:59.910
THAT KNOCKED OUT
THE CONTROLS.

20:59.954 --> 21:02.261
A RECALLED CIRCUIT BREAKER
COULD HAVE SPARKED

21:02.304 --> 21:04.698
AN ELECTRICAL FIRE
IN THE COCKPIT.

21:04.741 --> 21:06.308
I TAKE IT I'M READING
THEIR REPORT

21:06.352 --> 21:07.744
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
BELIEVE THAT.

21:07.788 --> 21:09.224
OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS,
I'VE DISCOVERED

21:09.268 --> 21:11.139
THAT ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS
WAS BATWOMAN

21:11.182 --> 21:13.968
WHILE THE OTHER RAN
AN ILLEGAL UNDERGROUND
MEDICAL CLINIC,

21:14.011 --> 21:17.754
SO I'M NOT TAKING ANYTHING
AT FACE VALUE ANYMORE.

21:20.670 --> 21:25.414
SIR...I--I CAN'T
EVEN IMAGINE

21:25.458 --> 21:29.113
WHAT YOU MUST BE
FEELING AS A FATHER
RIGHT NOW,

21:29.157 --> 21:33.292
BUT KATE WOULD WANT
YOU TO FIND PEACE.

21:33.335 --> 21:35.468
THEN ELIMINATE EACH
AND EVERY ONE OF HER ENEMIES

21:35.511 --> 21:37.644
WHO COULD HAVE DONE THIS
OR FIND ME THE ONE WHO DID

21:37.687 --> 21:40.908
SO I CAN KILL HIM
MYSELF.

21:40.951 --> 21:42.866
AND...IF I FIND
NOTHING THAT

21:42.910 --> 21:45.652
CONTRADICTS THIS REPORT,

21:45.695 --> 21:47.349
THEN WILL YOU PLEASE
ACCEPT IT

21:47.393 --> 21:49.612
AS WHAT I BELIEVE
IT IS,

21:49.656 --> 21:53.007
A HORRIBLE
AND TRAGIC ACCIDENT?

21:53.050 --> 21:56.967
CONVINCE ME I'M WRONG,
AND I'LL LET THIS GO.

22:06.803 --> 22:08.675
THIS IS YOUR IDEA
OF A SAFE SPACE?

22:08.718 --> 22:10.677
I NEED A DRINK,
AND YOU ONLY HAVE
EXPENSIVE WINE

22:10.720 --> 22:12.200
I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO LOOK AT.

22:12.243 --> 22:13.810
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN BE
IN ANY DANGER RIGHT NOW

22:13.854 --> 22:15.899
IF YOU HADN'T BEEN
OUT TAGGING AGAIN.

22:15.943 --> 22:17.901
IT'S HOW I EXPRESS
MYSELF.

22:17.945 --> 22:19.163
THEN GRAB A NOTEPAD.

22:19.207 --> 22:20.730
DEFACING PROPERTY
IS ILLEGAL.

22:20.774 --> 22:22.341
OH, MY GOD.

22:22.384 --> 22:24.081
WHY DID BATWOMAN
HAVE TO SAVE ME?

22:24.125 --> 22:25.518
I--I WAS HAVING
MORE FUN

22:25.561 --> 22:28.303
HAVING A CROWBAR
SWUNG TO MY FACE.

22:28.347 --> 22:31.785
SOUNDS LIKE Y'ALL COULD STAND
TO BE LESS SOBER RIGHT NOW.

22:31.828 --> 22:33.482
TWO CLUB SODAS.

22:33.526 --> 22:35.919
UH, VODKA
WITH A VODKA BACK.

22:37.660 --> 22:42.404
RYAN, THIS IS
MY LITTLER SISTER JORDAN.

22:42.448 --> 22:44.754
HMM. SO YOU WERE SAVED
BY BATWOMAN.

22:44.798 --> 22:46.190
THAT'S DOPE.

22:46.234 --> 22:49.150
YEAH. I MEAN,
IT WAS...FINE.

22:49.193 --> 22:51.674
FINE? IT'S BATWOMAN.

22:51.718 --> 22:56.331
YEAH, BUT SHE'S SO...
CRINGE.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.725
AT LEAST SHE DITCHED
THE PARTY WIG.

22:58.768 --> 23:01.336
HARSH WORDS FOR SOMEONE
WHO JUST SAVED YOUR LIFE.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.425
-SHE'S ONE OF THEM.
-ONE OF WHO?

23:03.469 --> 23:05.427
COPS, CROWS, THE LAW.

23:05.471 --> 23:08.212
JUST ANOTHER SUIT
WHO SHOOTS FIRST
AND ASKS LATER.

23:08.256 --> 23:11.302
OK. THEN...

23:11.346 --> 23:14.393
HOW WILL YOU STOP
GOTHAM'S CRIME PROBLEM?

23:14.436 --> 23:16.395
BEFORE IT STARTS.

23:16.438 --> 23:18.571
CURRENTLY, I'M WORKING
WITH GRASSROOTS
ORGANIZATIONS

23:18.614 --> 23:21.661
TO GET FUNDING
FOR A COMMUNITY CENTER
OFF SKID ROW,

23:21.704 --> 23:23.271
I'M ON A COUNCIL
TO MOVE MONEY

23:23.314 --> 23:25.142
TO NEIGHBORHOOD-LED
SAFETY INITIATIVES,

23:25.186 --> 23:27.841
AND I PHONE BANK
FOR NO NEW JAILS
IN GOTHAM CITY.

23:29.712 --> 23:31.671
THIS ONE'S
ON THE HOUSE.

23:31.714 --> 23:33.629
SHE'S...PASSIONATE.

23:33.673 --> 23:35.065
I CAN SEE THAT.

23:35.109 --> 23:36.502
LET'S GO.

23:38.373 --> 23:39.722
OK.

23:42.508 --> 23:45.032
SO...THE VIBES
ARE THERE,

23:45.075 --> 23:46.990
AND SIS JUST CAME
OUT OF THE CLOSET.

23:47.034 --> 23:48.949
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

23:48.992 --> 23:50.994
THIS IS ME BEING
YOUR WINGWOMAN--

23:51.038 --> 23:54.215
IN CASE YOU
MISSED IT.

23:54.258 --> 23:55.738
MOM TOLD YOU?

23:58.437 --> 24:00.830
JUST BECAUSE SHE
NEEDS TO TAKE
TIME WITH IT

24:00.874 --> 24:02.702
DOESN'T MEAN I DO.

24:06.967 --> 24:09.665
THANK YOU.

24:09.709 --> 24:14.235
SO...BARTENDER CHICK--
FIRE!

24:14.278 --> 24:16.193
NOPE. NOT HAPPENING.

24:16.237 --> 24:18.239
NOT EVEN
AN ENEMIES-TO-LOVERS MAYBE.

24:18.282 --> 24:19.936
YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO SWIPE RIGHT
ON SOMEONE EVENTUALLY.

24:19.980 --> 24:23.026
I GOT TO MAKE A CALL.
STAY PUT.

24:24.941 --> 24:27.727
HEY. I NEED YOU TO ASK
A FAVOR OF YOUR ASSOCIATE.

24:27.770 --> 24:30.512
SHE DOESN'T REALLY
DO FAVORS PER SE.

24:30.556 --> 24:32.514
I THINK BATWOMAN
HAS INTEL ON A MEMBER

24:32.558 --> 24:34.211
OF FALSE FACE.

24:34.255 --> 24:35.691
PERP I'M LOOKING INTO
WAS WEARING SOME KIND

24:35.735 --> 24:37.258
OF KEY BRACELET.

24:37.301 --> 24:38.694
SEEMED TO RING A BELL
WITH HER.

24:38.738 --> 24:40.000
WHY NOT USE THE CROWS?

24:40.043 --> 24:41.871
IT'LL TAKE
FORENSICS MONTHS.

24:41.915 --> 24:44.918
LUKE, FALSE FACE JUST
EXECUTED THE COMMISSIONER

24:44.961 --> 24:47.616
IN COLD BLOOD BECAUSE HE
SPOKE OUT AGAINST SNAKEBITE.

24:47.660 --> 24:50.227
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

24:50.271 --> 24:51.838
WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST TELL HER?

24:51.881 --> 24:53.622
BECAUSE RYAN TOLD US
SHE'S GOT THIS.

24:53.666 --> 24:55.537
I KNOW, BUT WOULDN'T
IT JUST BE EASIER

24:55.581 --> 24:57.321
IF SOPHIE HANDLED IT?

24:57.365 --> 24:59.454
ANGELIQUE IS RYAN'S
LESBIAN ACHILLES HEEL.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.456
SHE'S NOT GONNA
TURN HER OVER
TO THE AUTHORITIES,

25:01.500 --> 25:04.546
AND THIS WAY,
WE DON'T HAVE TO EITHER.

25:04.590 --> 25:06.679
WE TOLD RYAN WE'D
HOLD HER ACCOUNTABLE,

25:06.722 --> 25:09.029
AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN
GOING BEHIND HER BACK
THE FIRST CHANCE WE GET.

25:09.072 --> 25:10.770
DEFINITELY DIDN'T HAVE
LUKE PUTS HIS FAITH

25:10.813 --> 25:12.598
IN A SNAKEBITE DEALER
ON MY BINGO CARD.

25:12.641 --> 25:15.514
I'M PUTTING MY FAITH
IN RYAN.

25:15.557 --> 25:17.516
YOU WERE RIGHT.
WE'RE THE BAT TEAM,

25:17.559 --> 25:20.780
AND THE ONLY WAY IT WORKS
IS WE HAVE EACH OTHER'S BACK,

25:20.823 --> 25:22.999
EVEN IF WE DON'T
ALWAYS AGREE.

25:35.577 --> 25:38.580
I'M REALLY GLAD
YOU'RE CALLING.

25:38.624 --> 25:40.974
YOU WERE RIGHT.

25:41.017 --> 25:42.671
I GOT INTO THIS
THINKING I'D FOUND

25:42.715 --> 25:46.022
SOME VERSION
OF A FAMILY.

25:46.066 --> 25:50.157
I NEVER SIGNED UP
TO WATCH SOMEONE
GET GUNNED DOWN.

25:50.200 --> 25:53.116
THEN YOU'RE READY
TO MAKE IT RIGHT.

25:53.160 --> 25:56.250
WHO KILLED
THE COMMISSIONER?

25:56.293 --> 25:58.295
YOU REALLY FRIENDS
WITH BATWOMAN?

26:02.822 --> 26:04.432
I'M HERE.

26:04.475 --> 26:05.955
WE NEED TO FIND A SAFE HOUSE
FOR ANGELIQUE

26:05.999 --> 26:07.957
UNTIL THE REAL KILLERS
ARE BEHIND BARS.

26:08.001 --> 26:10.003
I KNOW AN UNDERGROUND CLINIC
THAT'S NOT BEING USED

26:10.046 --> 26:11.657
AT THE MOMENT.

26:11.700 --> 26:13.441
PERFECT. ANYTHING ELSE
ANYONE WANTS TO ADD?

26:13.484 --> 26:15.530
STARTS WITH AN "S,"
ENDS WITH ME SAYING,

26:15.574 --> 26:17.184
"I TOLD YOU SO"?

26:17.227 --> 26:18.794
EVEN IF WE DON'T AGREE
WITH THE METHOD,

26:18.838 --> 26:20.883
WE HAVE TO TRUST YOU
TO MAKE THE HARD DECISIONS.

26:20.927 --> 26:22.450
WE'RE A TEAM.

26:29.675 --> 26:33.287
ANGELIQUE? ANGELIQUE?

26:40.729 --> 26:42.731
THEY GOT TO HER.

26:45.647 --> 26:46.996
AAH!

26:47.040 --> 26:49.608
OH, OH, OH!

26:52.872 --> 26:56.397
ANGELIQUE MARTIN,

26:56.440 --> 26:58.878
I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE
INTERESTED IN LEAVING

26:58.921 --> 27:01.532
THE FALSE FACE SOCIETY.

27:04.797 --> 27:08.757
A WORD TO THE WISE.

27:08.801 --> 27:12.195
THAT'S WHAT LEAVING
LOOKS LIKE.

27:22.815 --> 27:24.120
ANGELIQUE'S PHONE
SENT A SIGNAL

27:24.164 --> 27:26.035
FROM THE WEST YARD
30 MINUTES AGO, THEN DIED.

27:26.079 --> 27:28.603
SO SHE'S SOMEWHERE
INSIDE A JANKY, OLD SAWMILL?

27:30.736 --> 27:32.738
GOTHAM BAD GUYS WOULDN'T
HAVE IT ANY OTHER WAY.

27:35.566 --> 27:37.394
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

27:52.758 --> 27:54.150
FOUND HER.

27:54.194 --> 27:56.500
BATWOMAN, I THINK
THEY FOUND YOU.

28:12.865 --> 28:14.170
YO. YOU OK?

28:14.214 --> 28:15.606
ASK THEM THAT.

28:26.792 --> 28:29.925
BATWOMAN, COME IN.
ARE YOU THERE?

28:29.969 --> 28:33.276
DON'T, NO.
PLEASE, PLEASE. HELP ME.

28:33.320 --> 28:35.235
OH, MY GOD.

28:35.278 --> 28:37.063
LUKE.

28:37.106 --> 28:39.761
THEY MUST HAVE
TAKEN MY COMMS.

28:39.805 --> 28:42.416
FIND THE WITNESS,
BRING HER TO ME.

28:42.459 --> 28:45.375
VERY SIMPLE TASK...

28:45.419 --> 28:47.464
AND YOU FAILED.

28:47.508 --> 28:50.337
CONSIDER THIS
YOUR TERMINATION NOTICE.

28:50.380 --> 28:52.600
NO, NO, PLEASE. COME ON.
NO, PLEASE, PLEASE.

28:52.643 --> 28:54.428
STOP IT, STOP IT.
PLEASE!

28:54.471 --> 28:56.952
OH, GOD!
PLEASE, PLEASE!

28:56.996 --> 28:59.085
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY,
I'M SORRY!

28:59.128 --> 29:00.564
OH, GOD!

29:07.702 --> 29:10.705
AHH. NEXT!

29:10.749 --> 29:12.272
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

29:12.315 --> 29:14.187
IT'S AN H.R. MATTER.
WHAT ARE YOU--OSHA?

29:14.230 --> 29:15.623
I'M HERE
FOR YOUR PRISONER.

29:15.666 --> 29:17.581
LET HER GO.
SHE'S NOT LIKE YOU.

29:17.625 --> 29:20.149
OH, PLEASE.
ENLIGHTEN ME.

29:20.193 --> 29:21.629
WHO AM I?

29:21.672 --> 29:23.239
YOU'RE A SADISTIC
DRUG LORD.

29:25.807 --> 29:28.854
OK. I CAN SEE
WHY YOU MIGHT
THINK THAT,

29:28.897 --> 29:32.858
BUT IT'S GOTHAM
THAT'S SADISTIC,
NOT ME,

29:32.901 --> 29:35.164
AND THEY SAY
THE BEST WAY TO
CHANGE THE SYSTEM

29:35.208 --> 29:36.731
IS FROM WITHIN.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.124
YOU'RE NOT CHANGING CRAP.

29:38.167 --> 29:39.603
AND YOU ARE?

29:39.647 --> 29:41.823
I'M DOING MY BEST
EVERY DAMN DAY!

29:41.867 --> 29:45.261
YOUR BEST ISN'T
GOOD ENOUGH,

29:45.305 --> 29:48.134
AND I KNOW THAT BETTER
THAN ANYONE.

29:48.177 --> 29:50.963
MY DAUGHTER WAS IMPRISONED
BY THE CROWS

29:51.006 --> 29:53.704
AND KILLED BY BATWOMAN.

29:53.748 --> 29:55.445
I NEVER KILLED
ANYONE.

29:55.489 --> 29:57.491
BUT YOU'VE TAKEN
ON THE SYMBOL
OF THE WOMAN WHO DID,

29:57.534 --> 30:01.495
SO TELL ME
IS THAT CHANGE,

30:01.538 --> 30:04.019
OR IS THAT JUST PANDERING
TO A SICK CITY

30:04.063 --> 30:07.370
THAT WORSHIPS
EXTREMIST CROWS AND BATS?

30:07.414 --> 30:10.852
MAYBE YOU WOULDN'T BOTHER
ME SO MUCH IF I SAID
I WAS A SQUIRREL.

30:10.896 --> 30:12.767
YOU'VE REALLY
CONVINCED YOURSELF

30:12.811 --> 30:16.075
THIS CREEPY MASK IS
A SYMBOL FOR, WHAT,
A CONCERNED CITIZEN?

30:16.118 --> 30:19.382
NO. IT'S A SYMBOL
OF LIBERATION

30:19.426 --> 30:21.167
FROM PEOPLE LIKE YOU,

30:21.210 --> 30:23.560
PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY'LL
NEVER BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE

30:23.604 --> 30:26.737
AS LONG AS THEY PRETEND
THAT WHAT THEY DO IS JUSTICE.

30:26.781 --> 30:29.697
LOOK. WE ALL HAVE
PAIN IN OUR PAST.

30:29.740 --> 30:31.873
YOU CAN'T USE IT
TO DO THIS.

30:34.136 --> 30:37.009
I PROMISE YOU
IF YOU LET US GO

30:37.052 --> 30:40.229
I WILL FIND OUT
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR DAUGHTER.

30:40.273 --> 30:41.752
THERE WILL BE
ACCOUNTABILITY.

30:41.796 --> 30:45.887
OH! THERE WILL INDEED.

30:45.931 --> 30:48.672
BUT NOT BECAUSE
OF ANYTHING YOU DID.

31:12.566 --> 31:15.699
THANK YOU!

31:15.743 --> 31:18.572
GOT AN SOS FROM LUKE.

31:18.615 --> 31:20.356
HE SAID YOUR COMMS
WENT OFF.

31:33.979 --> 31:36.503
YOU'RE SAFE NOW.
I GOT YOU.

31:36.546 --> 31:39.767
DAMN. RYAN WAS
ACTUALLY SERIOUS.

31:42.813 --> 31:45.425
ANGELIQUE'S GONNA TAKE DOWN
FALSE FACE,

31:45.468 --> 31:47.296
AND WE'RE GONNA
PROTECT HER.

31:59.091 --> 32:00.788
WHAT IS THIS?

32:00.831 --> 32:02.703
THAT WOULD BE
MY CONFESSION.

32:02.746 --> 32:06.272
COME ON. WE BOTH KNOW
YOU DIDN'T PULL
THE TRIGGER ON FORBES.

32:06.315 --> 32:09.101
A WITNESS SAW YOU DRIVE
THE GETAWAY CAR.

32:09.144 --> 32:13.148
WHY CONFESS TO A CRIME
YOU DIDN'T COMMIT?

32:13.192 --> 32:15.194
I KNEW THE CROWS
WERE DUMB.

32:15.237 --> 32:18.327
I DIDN'T KNOW THEY
WERE DEAF, TOO.

32:18.371 --> 32:21.374
IF YOU GIVE ME THE NAMES
OF THE SHOOTERS RIGHT NOW,

32:21.417 --> 32:23.680
I CAN HELP ARRANGE
A PLEA DEAL.

32:23.724 --> 32:26.901
YOU COULD GO FREE.

32:26.945 --> 32:30.470
I KILLED FORBES,
I PULLED THE TRIGGER,

32:30.513 --> 32:33.603
AND I ACTED ALONE.

32:33.647 --> 32:36.041
NOW READ ME
MY DAMN RIGHTS

32:36.084 --> 32:37.999

34:16.619 --> 34:20.449
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I KNOW THAT
CAN'T BE THE WAY IT IS.

34:20.493 --> 34:23.104
♪ BLUE SKIES

34:23.148 --> 34:25.585
HEY. WHEN DID YOU
BECOME SO WISE?

34:25.628 --> 34:28.283
WHEN YOU STOPPED SEEING ME
AS YOUR LITTLE SISTER.

34:28.327 --> 34:32.026
OOH. WELL, I HATE
TO BREAK IT TO YOU,

34:32.070 --> 34:35.073
BUT YOU'LL ALWAYS BE
MY LITTLE SIS.

HI. I'M AGENT JULIA PENNYWORTH.

34:45.735 --> 34:50.131
I'M INVESTIGATING THE CRASH
-OF FLIGHT GC9
-K23.

34:50.175 --> 34:52.873
AH, YEAH.
AGENT PENNYWORTH.

34:52.916 --> 34:55.136
WE SPOKE ABOUT THIS
LAST MONTH.

34:55.180 --> 34:57.225
UM, I'M SORRY?

34:57.269 --> 34:59.053
YOU CALLED LAST MONTH
INQUIRING

34:59.097 --> 35:00.620
ABOUT THE THIRD LOADER.

35:00.663 --> 35:02.665
I EXPLAINED IT WAS
A REPORTING ERROR.

35:02.709 --> 35:06.800
WE ONLY EMPLOY TWO LOADERS
AT NATIONAL CITY'S
PRIVATE AIRPORT.

35:06.843 --> 35:09.672
UM--HEH. I THINK
YOU'VE MISTAKEN ME
FOR SOMEBODY ELSE.

35:09.716 --> 35:11.805
I JUST STARTED
MY INVESTIGATION TODAY.

35:11.848 --> 35:14.460
JULIA, RIGHT?
IT'S KURT.

35:14.503 --> 35:16.244
WE TALKED
ABOUT YOUR ACCENT.

35:16.288 --> 35:18.420
WE BOTH USED TO SUMMER CAMP
IN OXFORDSHIRE.

35:20.857 --> 35:22.859
WHY DON'T I REMEMBER
SPEAKING WITH YOU?

35:30.998 --> 35:33.522
WHEN WE LEARNED
KATE WAS GONE,

35:33.566 --> 35:36.743
I ASKED MYSELF WHAT
MY LEGACY WOULD BE
AS BATWOMAN,

35:36.786 --> 35:39.180
BUT THAT WASN'T
THE RIGHT QUESTION.

35:39.224 --> 35:42.096
THE QUESTION ISN'T
WHO AM I IN THE SUIT.

35:42.140 --> 35:43.880
IT'S WHO AM I
OUT OF IT.

35:43.924 --> 35:46.753
TWO DAYS AGO,
I DIDN'T KNOW.

35:46.796 --> 35:50.148
BRUCE WAYNE HAD
THE BAT CODE FOR HIMSELF.

35:50.191 --> 35:53.063
I'M DECLARING THE 3 RULES
OF THE BAT TEAM.

35:53.107 --> 35:55.327
RULE NUMBER 3--

35:55.370 --> 35:57.720
WE'VE GOT
EACH OTHER'S BACKS...

36:00.027 --> 36:01.376
ALWAYS.

36:01.420 --> 36:03.378
-WORKS FOR ME.
-ME, TOO.

36:03.422 --> 36:04.988
SO IF WE'VE GOT
EACH OTHER'S BACK,

36:05.032 --> 36:06.555
THAT MEANS RULE NUMBER TWO.

36:06.599 --> 36:08.731
WE HOLD
EACH OTHER ACCOUNTABLE.

36:12.431 --> 36:14.172
LIKE YOU DID
FOR ME TODAY.

36:16.435 --> 36:18.480
MOST IMPORTANTLY,
WE STAND FOR SOMETHING

36:18.524 --> 36:21.614
BIGGER THAN OURSELVES.

36:21.657 --> 36:23.224
IT'S A LITTLE EASIER
SAID THAN DONE.

36:23.268 --> 36:24.704
WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING?

36:27.315 --> 36:31.885
BATWOMAN TAKES SOME
OF THE AWFUL OFF THE STREETS,

36:31.928 --> 36:33.756
BUT THE BAT TEAM NEEDS TO
REPLACE IT

36:33.800 --> 36:35.367
WITH SOMETHING POSITIVE.

36:35.410 --> 36:37.238
THAT'S HOW CHANGE HAPPENS.

36:37.282 --> 36:40.850
GETTING ADOPTED BY MAMA CORA,
THAT WAS MY GAME CHANGER,

36:40.894 --> 36:43.984
BUT ANGELIQUE
DIDN'T HAVE THAT.

36:44.027 --> 36:46.465
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE DOWN
BLACK MASK

36:46.508 --> 36:48.684
AND HIS FALSE FACE GANG,

36:48.728 --> 36:50.295
BUT WHAT ARE WE GONNA
BRING TO GOTHAM

36:50.338 --> 36:51.948
SO THAT NO OTHER GUY
COMES ALONG

36:51.992 --> 36:53.994
AND GETS HIS HOOKS
IN OTHER KIDS?

36:56.083 --> 37:00.566
JORDAN MOORE IS WORKING
ON BUILDING A COMMUNITY CENTER.

37:00.609 --> 37:03.090
I WANT US TO BRING IT
TO LIFE.

37:03.133 --> 37:05.919
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
YOU GUYS WANT TO HELP ME?

37:17.017 --> 37:19.237
SO THE KEY TO MAKING
MY PAIN DISAPPEAR

37:19.280 --> 37:21.369
IS TO DIG UP
MY DEAD CAT?

37:22.936 --> 37:24.503
HMM.

37:48.135 --> 37:50.833
I AM NOT OPENING
A DEAD KITTY'S COFFIN.

37:50.877 --> 37:52.400
THEN WHY'D YOU DIG
THE HOLE?

37:55.055 --> 37:57.318
OK. MY INTEREST
IS PIQUED.

38:10.505 --> 38:12.202
WHAT IS HAPPENING?

38:12.246 --> 38:14.074
THIS IS WHAT YOU
DO, ALICE.

38:14.117 --> 38:15.945
WHAT YOU DID THAT DAY
IN YOUR CELL

38:15.989 --> 38:17.730
WHEN YOU LEARNED
TO SEW FACES USING
HUMAN FLESH.

38:17.773 --> 38:19.427
THEN YOU DID IT AGAIN
WHEN YOU FOUND

38:19.471 --> 38:20.820
YOUR MOTHER'S HEAD
IN A FREEZER.

38:23.431 --> 38:25.694
I'M HAVING
A PSYCHOTIC BREAK.

38:25.738 --> 38:28.480
WHEN YOUR REALITY
IS TOO MUCH FOR YOU
TO PROCESS,

38:28.523 --> 38:29.872
YOU IMAGINE THINGS
ASKEW

38:29.916 --> 38:32.179
SO THEY'RE EASIER
TO DIGEST.

38:32.222 --> 38:34.834
YOU PRETEND YOU'RE
IN WONDERLAND
DRINKING TEA,

38:34.877 --> 38:36.575
OR YOU BLACK OUT
YOUR OWN MORAL CODE

38:36.618 --> 38:38.446
TO SCORCH A WOMAN
TO DEATH,

38:38.490 --> 38:41.014
OR YOU SEE
YOUR DEAD SISTER.

38:41.057 --> 38:43.408
I'M NOT HANDLING KATE'S
DEATH VERY WELL, AM I?

38:43.451 --> 38:45.366
YOU'RE IN SHOCK,
AND YOU KNOW

38:45.410 --> 38:46.933
THAT ONCE IT
WEARS OFF

38:46.976 --> 38:49.936
YOU'LL BE STRUCK
BY A TSUNAMI OF GRIEF.

38:52.852 --> 38:55.376
HOW DOES ONE DEAL
WITH GRIEF EXACTLY?

38:55.420 --> 38:56.986
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

38:57.030 --> 38:59.380
YOU'VE NEVER DONE
THAT BEFORE,

38:59.424 --> 39:01.817
AND YOU'RE SCARED
OF WHAT IT WILL
MAKE YOU DO.

39:01.861 --> 39:03.297
OR UNDO.

39:03.341 --> 39:04.864
SPARE YOURSELF
THE PAIN.

39:04.907 --> 39:07.040
YOUR MIND IS
LIMITLESS, ALICE.

39:07.083 --> 39:10.652
IF IT CAN MAKE YOU
BELIEVE YOU'RE PETTING
YOUR DEAD CAT RIGHT NOW,

39:10.696 --> 39:13.133
IT CAN MAKE YOU
BELIEVE ANYTHING.

39:14.917 --> 39:18.573
IT CAN MAKE ME BELIEVE
IN A WORLD WHERE KATE
NEVER EXISTED.

39:27.669 --> 39:30.063
I CAN FORGET YOU, KATE.

39:47.602 --> 39:50.083
POOR THING.

39:50.126 --> 39:52.912
WHAT HAPPENED
TO HER FACE?

39:52.955 --> 39:56.437
SHE FOUGHT MY MEN
WHILE THEY WERE PULLING
HER FROM THE PLANE.

39:56.481 --> 39:58.700
DIDN'T GO SO WELL
FOR HER.

39:58.744 --> 40:01.660
I SUPPOSE IT'S
FOR THE BEST.

40:01.703 --> 40:06.142
FACIAL RECOGNITION
LEADS TO MEMORY RECALL.

40:06.186 --> 40:07.840
LEAVE US.

40:23.943 --> 40:27.468
HELLO.

40:27.512 --> 40:29.296
MY NAME IS ENIGMA.

40:32.342 --> 40:36.346
YOU WON'T BE NEEDING
THIS ANYMORE.

40:36.390 --> 40:39.175
IT'S TIME TO SAY
GOOD-BYE...

40:39.219 --> 40:40.960
TO KATE KANE.

41:13.340 --> 41:15.298
GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD!
