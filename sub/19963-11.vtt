¶¶

00:03.938 --> 00:05.838
(theme song playing)

00:08.809 --> 00:12.277
<i> ¶ I got the wind in my hair</i>
<i> and a fire within ¶</i>

00:12.279 --> 00:14.313
<i> ¶ 'Cause there's</i>
<i> something beginning ¶</i>

00:14.315 --> 00:20.052
<i> ¶ I got a mystery to solve</i>
<i> and excitement to spare ¶</i>

00:20.054 --> 00:23.222
<i> ¶ That beautiful breeze</i>
<i> blowing through ¶</i>

00:23.224 --> 00:28.060
<i> ¶</i> I'm ready to follow it
who knows where<i> ¶</i>

00:28.062 --> 00:30.662
<i> ¶ I'll get there, I swear ¶</i>

00:30.664 --> 00:36.869
<i> ¶ With the wind in my hair ¶</i>

00:42.743 --> 00:44.810
(dramatic music plays)

00:51.218 --> 00:52.284
(squeaks)

00:55.089 --> 00:56.922

00:56.924 --> 00:58.590
(shrieks)

01:01.262 --> 01:02.528
(squeaks)

01:02.530 --> 01:04.563
(hisses, shrieks)

01:14.341 --> 01:15.140
-(snake shrieks)
-(both squeak)

01:21.215 --> 01:23.282
(squeaks)

01:23.284 --> 01:25.417
(shrieks, hisses)

01:29.123 --> 01:30.322
(squeaking gasp)

01:32.593 --> 01:34.493
(squeaking scream)

01:38.632 --> 01:40.199
(squeaking gasp)

01:42.269 --> 01:43.669
(pants)

01:47.374 --> 01:48.273
(squeaks sadly)

01:53.314 --> 01:54.446
(squeaks)

01:54.448 --> 01:56.215
(sighs)

01:58.319 --> 02:00.853
(girl humming musically)

02:06.460 --> 02:07.860
(chirps)

02:10.464 --> 02:13.165
(hissing)

02:13.167 --> 02:17.035
(humming continues)

-(pan clangs)
-(leaves rustle)

02:38.926 --> 02:40.893
(squeaks)

02:44.331 --> 02:47.699
Young Rapunzel:
<i> ¶ Flower, gleam and glow ¶</i>

02:47.701 --> 02:51.436
<i> ¶ Let your power shine ¶</i>

02:51.438 --> 02:54.206
<i> ¶ Make the clock reverse ¶</i>

02:54.208 --> 02:58.277
¶ Bring back
what once was mine ¶

02:58.279 --> 03:01.613
¶ Heal what has been hurt ¶

03:01.615 --> 03:04.783
¶ Change the fates' design ¶

03:04.785 --> 03:08.287
¶ Save what has been lost ¶

03:08.289 --> 03:11.323
¶ Bring back what
once was mine ¶

03:11.325 --> 03:15.394
¶ What once was mine ¶

03:17.064 --> 03:18.197
(squeaks)

03:19.967 --> 03:21.366
Don't be afraid,
Mr. Frog.

03:21.368 --> 03:22.601
You're safe now.

03:23.637 --> 03:25.370
Here, it's yours.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.972
-(squeaks)
-It's a gift.

03:32.046 --> 03:34.713
-(laughs)
-(squeaking laugh)

03:36.750 --> 03:38.183
All alone, huh?

03:38.185 --> 03:42.254
-(squeaks)
-So am I...
most of the time.

03:42.256 --> 03:44.556
If you want,
you can stay with me,

03:44.558 --> 03:47.226
then neither of us
will be alone ever.

03:47.228 --> 03:49.428
(squeaks happily)

03:49.430 --> 03:52.431
(lively music playing)

03:55.169 --> 03:56.535
(squeaks)

03:56.537 --> 03:58.937
(giggles, laughs)

04:03.277 --> 04:04.343
(squeaks)

04:08.382 --> 04:09.781
(sighs)

04:22.730 --> 04:24.463
(giggles)
Perfect.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.267
(squeaks)

04:33.540 --> 04:34.706
(squeaks)

04:34.708 --> 04:37.576
Good night, Pascal. Mwah.

04:37.578 --> 04:40.479
You'll always be
my best friend.

04:40.481 --> 04:43.181
(chitters)

04:47.488 --> 04:49.221
(groans)

04:49.223 --> 04:50.856
(squeaks)

05:08.175 --> 05:10.342
-(humming musically)
-(bubbling)

05:10.344 --> 05:12.678
(squeaking)

05:14.515 --> 05:16.481
Oh! Pascal!

05:16.483 --> 05:19.551
Thank goodness my trusted
taste-tester is here.

05:24.591 --> 05:27.426
-Ooh, mama!
Plum gravy!
-(squeaks)

05:27.428 --> 05:29.428
(slurps, sloshes)

05:30.631 --> 05:33.532
Mmm. Could use
a touch more balsamic.

05:33.534 --> 05:35.467
-(growling)
-Hmm. Yeah.

05:35.469 --> 05:37.135
(clatters)

05:37.137 --> 05:39.037
Maybe just a little?

05:39.973 --> 05:42.307
-(annoyed squeak)
-(slurps)

05:42.309 --> 05:44.476
Now, that's plum gravy, baby.

05:44.478 --> 05:46.745
(squeaks)

05:48.716 --> 05:51.516
-Bleh!
-Eh! What do you know, frog?

05:51.518 --> 05:53.585
It's an acquired taste.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.464
-(squeaks)
-(clatters)

06:05.466 --> 06:07.065
Nice move, Pascal.

06:07.067 --> 06:09.568
-I didn't even see that coming.
-What was that?

06:09.570 --> 06:12.337
-What was what?
-Congratulating your opponent?

06:12.339 --> 06:14.506
Chess is war, Rapunzel,

06:14.508 --> 06:16.074
and your opponent
is the enemy.

06:16.076 --> 06:17.542
First rule
of a game of chess

06:17.544 --> 06:19.344
is getting in
your opponent's head.

06:19.346 --> 06:21.580
Now, give me
your game face.

06:21.582 --> 06:24.483
-(grunting)
-(squeaks)

06:24.485 --> 06:26.885
Hmm.
I don't know, Pascal.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.554
That's more...
confused face.

06:30.724 --> 06:34.159
-Game face!
-Uh, we'll work on that later.

06:34.161 --> 06:37.262
Now, I want you
to look at this board
with only one strategy:

06:37.264 --> 06:39.564
-No mercy.
-(squeaks)

06:39.566 --> 06:43.034
Not now, Pascal.
I'm no-mercying my enemy.

06:43.036 --> 06:45.170
(chitters, squeaks)

06:47.441 --> 06:50.041
(grunting)

06:50.043 --> 06:52.844
(laughs) Hyah!

06:52.846 --> 06:54.880
(squeaks)

06:54.882 --> 06:55.914
I know.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.516
We're better
with pans, Pascal,

06:57.518 --> 07:00.385
but swords seem
to be the weapon
of choice outside the tower.

07:00.387 --> 07:01.453
(Max neighs)

07:03.390 --> 07:06.358
Ha! Finally,
a worth opponent!

07:06.360 --> 07:08.927
<i> En garde!</i>
(laughs)

07:08.929 --> 07:10.462
-(squeaks sadly)
-(Rapunzel laughs)

07:15.903 --> 07:17.769
(squeaks)

07:19.907 --> 07:21.473
(sighs)

07:22.776 --> 07:24.810
Let me.
We're late enough as it is.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.244
Pbbbt!

07:26.246 --> 07:29.481
And you still need
to sign Freidborg's card.

07:29.483 --> 07:31.583
Looks great.
Thank you.

07:31.585 --> 07:34.653
This is girl is ready
to ¶ party! ¶

07:34.655 --> 07:38.590
-(laughs)
-(squeaks)

07:38.592 --> 07:42.594
I'm so sorry, Pascal.
You know Freidborg is allergic
to lizards, right?

07:42.596 --> 07:43.829
(whispers)
Remember the hives?

07:43.831 --> 07:47.098
(groans)

07:47.100 --> 07:48.633
I'll save you some cake.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.669
-(squeaks)
-Mwah.

07:52.739 --> 07:55.140
This is gonna
be so much fun!

07:55.142 --> 07:56.675
(groans)

08:02.282 --> 08:04.616
Shorty:
All alone again, huh?

08:04.618 --> 08:07.686
I know how that goes.
Believe me.

08:07.688 --> 08:10.422
Sometimes friends
can let you down.

08:10.424 --> 08:13.091
-(squeaks sadly)
-But you know what I say?

08:13.093 --> 08:17.429
The key to that door is
not to let it keep you down.

08:17.431 --> 08:19.097
(squeaks)

08:19.099 --> 08:21.166
Now, that's
what I'm talking about!

08:21.168 --> 08:23.802
Now, you get out there
and you do that thing!

08:23.804 --> 08:26.705
(squeaking)

08:28.141 --> 08:32.611
So, you just gonna sit there
all leafy and silent, huh?

08:32.613 --> 08:35.714
Fine! Don't take my advice.

08:35.716 --> 08:39.384
Ha! Forget it.
I can't stay mad at you!

08:40.988 --> 08:42.621
-(chitters)
-(Rapunzel yawns)

08:42.623 --> 08:44.122
(squeaks)

08:45.559 --> 08:47.792
Pascal? What's all this?

08:47.794 --> 08:49.794
(squeaks)

08:49.796 --> 08:53.098
You planned a whole day
for us? How fun!

08:54.801 --> 08:56.067
(door opens)

08:56.069 --> 08:57.669
(sighs)
Rapunzel.

08:57.671 --> 09:00.038
You're supposed
to be at breakfast
with the duke's daughter.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.374
-Oh, right. (sighs)
-(squeaks)

09:02.376 --> 09:03.975
Rapunzel:
But after that we can--

09:03.977 --> 09:05.644
Cassandra:
After that, you have
to teach art class,

09:05.646 --> 09:08.046
then you promised Max
you'd play polo
before your council meeting.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.015
After that is
the music mix 'n' mingle
with Hookfoot,

09:10.017 --> 09:11.583
then audience with citizens.

09:11.585 --> 09:14.586
(emphatically)
You're booked solid all day.

09:14.588 --> 09:16.288
(squeaky sigh)

09:17.424 --> 09:19.324
I'm so sorry, Pascal,

09:19.326 --> 09:20.759
but these things
are really important.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.761
Come on, Rapunzel.
You can play together later.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.829
Oh, I know!
Let's have dinner!

09:24.831 --> 09:26.831
Just you and me,
like old times.

09:26.833 --> 09:28.199
We can tackle
one of those puzzles.

09:28.201 --> 09:30.535
(squeaks)

09:30.537 --> 09:33.505
Yup. Six o'clock.
Promise.

09:33.507 --> 09:34.773
(squeaks)

09:36.043 --> 09:37.242
(clock chiming)

09:37.244 --> 09:38.610
(squeaks)

09:55.796 --> 09:57.596
(sighs)

09:57.598 --> 09:58.663
(ticks)

10:00.701 --> 10:03.868
Those are all...
interesting...

10:03.870 --> 10:07.539
official Corona
slogan proposals.
(chuckles)

10:07.541 --> 10:09.608
Especially "Corona:

10:09.610 --> 10:12.377
Hittin' 'Em Where
the Sun Does Shine."

10:12.379 --> 10:14.813
(laughs)
That's my favorite.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.481
Especially that one.

10:17.551 --> 10:18.783
(chuckles)

10:20.253 --> 10:22.654
Okay, that was
the last citizen.

10:22.656 --> 10:25.824
-(whispers) Uh... one more.
-Shorty: Your Highness,
Your Highness!

10:25.826 --> 10:29.260
-(snorting)
-This swine demands
to be heard.

10:29.262 --> 10:32.163
I will translate
for your convenience,

10:32.165 --> 10:35.367
for I am fluent
in Pig Latin.

10:38.639 --> 10:40.171
(grumbling)

10:41.441 --> 10:42.707
-(door handle jiggling)
-(squeaks)

10:43.844 --> 10:45.010
(squeaks)

10:45.946 --> 10:47.078
(squeaks excitedly)

10:48.915 --> 10:51.349
-(sniffing)
-(squeaks angrily)

10:51.351 --> 10:52.951
-(gasps) Gangway!
-(squeaking)

10:52.953 --> 10:54.619
I smell stroganoff!

10:54.621 --> 10:55.920
It's not for me?

10:55.922 --> 10:59.791
Oh, why, I wasn't
actually going to eat it.

10:59.793 --> 11:02.794
I just wanted
to take a second
to raise a glass to you...

11:02.796 --> 11:04.863
-and then lower it.
-(squeaks)

11:04.865 --> 11:06.331
(chuckles)
Now, where was I?

11:07.701 --> 11:10.301
-Shorty: Your Highness,
there are more pigs...
-(grunting)

11:10.303 --> 11:12.771
...than my washtub bed
can accommodate,

11:12.773 --> 11:16.708
and so I humbly request
a million money coins,

11:16.710 --> 11:21.446
that are currency,
to build Corona's
first piggy bank.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.648
Here is a petition

11:23.650 --> 11:27.385
signed by several
prominent members
of the pig community

11:27.387 --> 11:29.654
oinking their support.

11:29.656 --> 11:34.526
No! Buster,
we agreed to split that!

11:34.528 --> 11:36.194
I can see
that you're mad

11:36.196 --> 11:39.531
that I ate every single thing
at this table. Mwah!

11:39.533 --> 11:43.034
And I know you and I
haven't always seen eyeball

11:43.036 --> 11:45.637
to weird, giant,
lizard eyeball,

11:45.639 --> 11:47.739
but the thing is,
you shouldn't be mad at me.

11:47.741 --> 11:51.009
Really, you should be mad
at whoever stood you up,

11:51.011 --> 11:54.813
whoever took you
and all this fine food
for granted.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.815
If it were me...
(laughs)

11:56.817 --> 12:00.485
you wouldn't see
old Lance waiting around,
that's for sure. Nope!

12:00.487 --> 12:04.689
I know when I'm not wanted,
but that's what makes you
better than me.

12:04.691 --> 12:08.159
Ah! Now,
if you'll excuse me...

12:08.161 --> 12:09.861
(sighs)

12:09.863 --> 12:11.763
I've got a food coma
to slip into.

12:11.765 --> 12:13.598
-(snoring)
-(squeaks)

12:13.600 --> 12:15.233
Mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi.

12:16.403 --> 12:17.902
There you are!
I need to talk to you.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.404
Eugene,
I really have to--

12:19.406 --> 12:22.841
Blondie, I've had
two things running
through my mind all day:

12:22.843 --> 12:25.443
"What is chutney?"
and you.

12:25.445 --> 12:26.945
What say you and I
head over to the canal

12:26.947 --> 12:29.247
for a romantic cruise,
just the two of us?

12:29.249 --> 12:30.949
Still haven't figured out
that chutney thing.

12:30.951 --> 12:33.017
I'm sorry, Eugene.
I promised Pascal

12:33.019 --> 12:35.420
I'd have dinner with him,
and I'm already late.

12:35.422 --> 12:38.089
Oh! Getting ditched
for a frog. Ouch!

12:38.091 --> 12:40.692
-Right in the ego.
-Aww!

12:40.694 --> 12:43.128
-Are we jealous of Pascal?
-(squeaks)

12:43.130 --> 12:45.363
Don't worry. You're still
my best friend...

12:45.365 --> 12:46.531
-(squeaks)
-(slams)

12:46.533 --> 12:48.199
...after Pascal.

12:48.201 --> 12:50.769
(gasps) Oh!
Maybe Lance can join you
on your cruise.

12:50.771 --> 12:52.771
Mwah. Night!

12:52.773 --> 12:55.106
But Lance always wants
to steer the boat!

12:55.108 --> 12:56.741
I like steering the boat!

12:56.743 --> 13:00.979
And there is no way Lance
has any knowledge of chutney.

13:10.657 --> 13:12.624
(chitters)

13:12.626 --> 13:14.526
(squeaks, grumbles)

13:20.834 --> 13:22.967
(squeaks)

13:22.969 --> 13:24.936
Young Rapunzel:
<i> You'll always be</i>
<i> my best friend.</i>

13:24.938 --> 13:27.005
(squeaky sigh)

13:37.017 --> 13:39.684
Pascal? Are you in here?

13:39.686 --> 13:41.820
I'm so sorry
I missed dinner.

13:44.024 --> 13:45.924
(wind blowing)

13:45.926 --> 13:47.892
Pascal?

13:59.973 --> 14:02.307
(snoring)

14:02.309 --> 14:04.776
-Eugene?
-Whoa! Leave my cheekbones
out of this!

14:04.778 --> 14:06.845
-Who? What? Where?
-Are you awake?

14:06.847 --> 14:09.514
Umm, I am now.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.950
(breathes heavily)
Pascal's missing.

14:11.952 --> 14:15.954
Yeah. Doesn't he disappear?
Isn't that, you know, his thing?

14:15.956 --> 14:19.691
-Well, yes, but he's--
-I'm sure he's fine.

14:19.693 --> 14:22.026
Now, if you'll
excuse me, sleepy.

14:22.028 --> 14:24.996
He has never ever
spent the night away
from me before.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.130
This isn't like him!

14:26.132 --> 14:28.166
(gasps)
What if something
happened to him?

14:28.168 --> 14:31.703
What if he's alone and--
and scared and in danger?

14:34.741 --> 14:36.107
I'll get my boots.

14:46.887 --> 14:48.052
(chitters)

14:49.256 --> 14:51.489
(snake hisses)

15:02.702 --> 15:04.836
(sniffing)

15:07.374 --> 15:08.606
(sighs)
Pascal?

15:09.843 --> 15:10.909
Pascal?

15:14.948 --> 15:16.080
Pascal?

15:17.050 --> 15:19.918
(anxiously)
Hello! Come out, buddy!

15:19.920 --> 15:21.719
Blondie, are you sure
you wanna keep--

15:21.721 --> 15:23.388
(panicked)
Yes! I'm sure
I want to keep looking!

15:23.390 --> 15:25.390
Okay! Looking!
I'm looking!
Still looking!

15:25.392 --> 15:27.525
-Rapunzel, I--
-Hey! Cass, good morning.

15:27.527 --> 15:30.628
You look less pale today.
Looking for Rapunzel?
Yeah, I wouldn't.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.964
She's a little upset,
so you might want
to keep your--

15:32.966 --> 15:34.766
-Move it, powder puff.
<i> -Ole.</i>

15:34.768 --> 15:36.134
-Tried to warn ya.
-Cassandra: Raps?

15:36.136 --> 15:37.802
(frantically)
Did he turn up?
Did you find anything?

15:37.804 --> 15:39.404
Did anyone see anything?
Is he okay?

15:39.406 --> 15:41.906
Uh... no.

15:41.908 --> 15:43.975
No word on Pascal.

15:43.977 --> 15:46.811
Look, we're going
to have to call off
the search for now.

15:46.813 --> 15:48.112
What are you talking about?

15:48.114 --> 15:50.581
I know you're worried
about Pascal, we all are,

15:50.583 --> 15:52.650
but you have
another packed day
ahead of you.

15:52.652 --> 15:55.386
-Listen, Rapunzel--
-(adamantly) No, you listen.

15:55.388 --> 15:58.957
Cancel everything.
Lock down the castle.

15:58.959 --> 16:02.293
Nothing gets done
until we find Pascal.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.228
Nothing is
more important
than that.

16:04.230 --> 16:06.731
Nothing.
Is that clear?

16:08.134 --> 16:10.001
(whispers)
I would do what she says.

16:10.003 --> 16:12.503
Now that is a game face.

16:12.505 --> 16:14.472
(nickers)

16:14.474 --> 16:17.075
-(scribbles)
-(sighs)

16:17.077 --> 16:18.409
How's this?

16:18.411 --> 16:20.345
Well, it's a good likeness,

16:20.347 --> 16:22.246
but why does
he look so terrified?

16:22.248 --> 16:25.516
Because he's so scared and--
and all alone and--

16:25.518 --> 16:27.318
and frightened without me.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.021
He ran away,
and it's all my fault.

16:30.023 --> 16:32.323
I have been so busy
with other things

16:32.325 --> 16:34.192
that I've neglected
our friendship.

16:34.194 --> 16:35.827
Uh, plus you missed
dinner with him.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.997
Uh, but don't be so hard
on yourself, blondie.

16:38.999 --> 16:42.734
You don't know that for sure.
Besides, he couldn't have
gotten far. He's tiny.

16:51.478 --> 16:52.844
(gasps)

16:55.115 --> 16:56.347
I know where he is.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.217
(creaking)

17:05.358 --> 17:07.525
(hissing)

17:09.029 --> 17:11.095
(dramatic music plays)

17:17.237 --> 17:18.970
Where are we going?

17:18.972 --> 17:20.405
-The tower!
-The tower?

17:20.407 --> 17:21.973
The tower tower?

17:21.975 --> 17:24.942
Okay, we really
need to start voting
on decisions like these.

17:28.882 --> 17:30.548
(chitters, squeaks)

17:32.886 --> 17:34.252
(sighs)

17:36.656 --> 17:39.290
(squeaks)

17:45.498 --> 17:47.432
(squeaking)

17:50.670 --> 17:53.304
-(snake hisses)
-(squeaks "uh-oh")

17:54.507 --> 17:56.274
-(hisses)
-(squeaks)

18:00.246 --> 18:01.145
(shrieks)

18:05.785 --> 18:07.251
(gasps) Oh.

18:10.056 --> 18:11.122
Cassandra:
Wow.

18:11.124 --> 18:13.357
So, this is where
it all happened.

18:13.359 --> 18:14.926
Yeah.
(chuckles nervously)

18:14.928 --> 18:18.096
This is the first time
I've been back since--

18:18.098 --> 18:20.631
Rapunzel, you don't have
to go up there alone.

18:20.633 --> 18:23.801
Yes, I do.
I owe it to Pascal.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.803
Oh, it's probably better
I stay down here.

18:25.805 --> 18:28.206
I have a strict rule about dying
in the same place twice.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.660
(sighs, whispers)
Come on, you got this.

18:49.662 --> 18:53.097
Don't be afraid, Rapunzel.
It's just a tower.

18:53.099 --> 18:55.233
(breathes shakily)

18:55.235 --> 18:56.968
(sighs deeply)

19:01.307 --> 19:03.107
(squeaking frantically)

19:03.109 --> 19:04.242
(hissing)

19:07.447 --> 19:08.946
(clangs)

19:08.948 --> 19:10.781
(squeaking)

19:10.783 --> 19:13.217
(hissing)

19:18.258 --> 19:19.624
(hissing)

19:19.626 --> 19:20.858
(squeaking frantically)

19:22.996 --> 19:24.362
(hissing)

19:31.471 --> 19:33.004
(panting)

19:33.006 --> 19:34.338
-Rapunzel: Pascal?
-(squeaks)

19:35.375 --> 19:37.875
(hisses)

19:41.114 --> 19:43.247
Rapunzel:
Pascal, are you up there?

19:45.652 --> 19:47.385
(hisses)

19:51.791 --> 19:54.058
-(creaks open)
-Hello?

19:55.528 --> 19:57.862
-Pascal?
-(hisses)

20:10.343 --> 20:11.442
(hisses)

20:12.412 --> 20:13.878
(laughing squeak)

20:21.321 --> 20:23.387
(hisses, gasps)

20:23.389 --> 20:26.090
(shrieks)

20:28.895 --> 20:30.828
(whimpers)

20:33.399 --> 20:35.066
-(pan clangs)
-(snake shrieks)

20:35.068 --> 20:37.668
-(rustles)
-(horses nicker)

20:37.670 --> 20:38.736
Friend of yours?

20:38.738 --> 20:41.339
-(shrieks, spits)
-(clatters)

20:42.542 --> 20:44.475
(squeaks)

20:45.778 --> 20:48.279
-(chitters)
-Oh, buddy.

20:48.281 --> 20:50.448
I know why you came here.

20:50.450 --> 20:53.384
Life was so simple
when it was just
the two of us,

20:53.386 --> 20:55.953
but that doesn't mean
that I don't love you.

20:55.955 --> 20:57.855
That will never change.

20:59.892 --> 21:02.360
You will always be
my best friend.

21:02.362 --> 21:07.031
Besides, nobody could
ever take your place
in my heart.

21:07.033 --> 21:08.566
(chitters)

21:08.568 --> 21:11.435
(giggles)
Or on my shoulder.

21:17.744 --> 21:19.777
It wasn't the same
without you here.

21:21.614 --> 21:25.149
-(chitters)
-Mwah. Good night, Pascal.

21:25.151 --> 21:26.317
(chitters)

21:27.553 --> 21:30.321
Uh-uh. I don't think so.

21:31.257 --> 21:32.323
Here is better.

21:33.559 --> 21:34.992
Right by my side.

21:36.562 --> 21:39.664
(lively music playing)

21:41.501 --> 21:45.136
<i> ¶ You and me,</i>
<i> we fit together perfectly ¶</i>

21:45.138 --> 21:46.637
<i> ¶ Best friends forever ¶</i>

21:46.639 --> 21:50.608
<i> ¶ Guaranteed,</i>
<i> I'll always see you through ¶</i>

21:50.610 --> 21:52.476

21:56.616 --> 22:00.584

<i> that's how it's meant to be ¶</i>

22:00.586 --> 22:04.755
<i> ¶ 'Cause it's you and me,</i>
<i> you and me ¶</i>

22:07.593 --> 22:10.594
(theme music playing)

22:10.596 --> 22:13.497

<i> my eyes open and wide ¶</i>

22:13.499 --> 22:16.133

22:16.135 --> 22:18.302
