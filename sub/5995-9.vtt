WEBVTT

00:00.834 --> 00:04.205
*

00:04.238 --> 00:08.509
WOMAN:
(coughs) No matter what,

00:08.542 --> 00:10.511
we will always have each other.

00:10.544 --> 00:13.047
MAN (choked up): Your illness
has brought us together,

00:13.081 --> 00:14.515
so thank you, cancer,

00:14.548 --> 00:16.684
for showing us
what friendship is all about.

00:16.717 --> 00:19.553
WOMAN:
We'll all be friends...

00:19.587 --> 00:21.655
(crying):
...till the end.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.524
What's up, man?

00:23.557 --> 00:24.658
How's it going, bro?

00:24.692 --> 00:27.061
Man, that was
crazy, man...

00:27.095 --> 00:29.097
(indistinct chatter)

00:35.603 --> 00:39.107
* I have friends

00:39.140 --> 00:42.576
* I definitely have friends

00:42.610 --> 00:46.247
* Friends, friends,
friendly friends *

00:46.280 --> 00:49.150
* I have all the friends.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.228
Ah, that movie
was so us.

01:00.261 --> 01:02.430
Mm-hmm.
Except none of
us have cancer.

01:02.463 --> 01:03.764
Yet.

01:03.797 --> 01:05.333
JOSH: I totally
relate to Chad,

01:05.366 --> 01:08.202
the sensitive jock who
eats clean and journals hard.

01:08.236 --> 01:09.670
Yeah, and I'm so
the bad-boy rich kid

01:09.703 --> 01:11.772
who sleeps with that
hot girl in remission.

01:11.805 --> 01:14.308
And I am so exactly
like that caring nurse

01:14.342 --> 01:16.210
who donated her
bone marrow.

01:16.244 --> 01:19.413
You didn't feel any connection
to the vain yoga instructor?

01:19.447 --> 01:20.514
She was fat.

01:20.548 --> 01:21.515
Mmm.

01:21.549 --> 01:24.418
What a cool crew.

01:24.452 --> 01:25.553
JOSH:
So...

01:25.586 --> 01:27.421
beach day Saturday?

01:27.455 --> 01:29.423
Gonna be one of those
classic January scorchers.

01:29.457 --> 01:30.424
Brilliant idea.

01:30.458 --> 01:31.425
Uh, brilliant?

01:31.459 --> 01:33.327
We're really lowering
the bar for that word.

01:33.361 --> 01:34.462
Oh, I think we're
raising the bar...

01:34.495 --> 01:36.330
on the roof.
(grunting)

01:36.364 --> 01:37.298
(grunting)

01:37.331 --> 01:38.832
Yeah, you didn't think
about that, did you?

01:38.866 --> 01:40.301
No, it doesn't
really make sense.

01:40.334 --> 01:42.403
But, uh, why don't we
skip the beach this time

01:42.436 --> 01:43.737
and do something different
for a change,

01:43.771 --> 01:45.539
like go to the Getty in L.A.?

01:45.573 --> 01:46.874
*

01:46.907 --> 01:48.876
It's a museum,
let's see some art.

01:48.909 --> 01:50.411
(others groan
in dissent)

01:50.444 --> 01:51.379
Why?

01:51.412 --> 01:52.780
JOSH: Nah, nah, let's
stick to the beach.

01:52.813 --> 01:53.847
They have art there.

01:53.881 --> 01:56.450
They have that lady that
paints bikinis on the girls.

01:56.484 --> 01:58.452
Yeah, I'm so stoked.

01:58.486 --> 01:59.287
And I promise
this time

01:59.320 --> 02:01.255
I'm not gonna oversleep
and miss it.

02:01.289 --> 02:02.523
You probably will.

02:02.556 --> 02:03.857
Come on, Greg.

02:03.891 --> 02:05.493
It's a crew day.

02:05.526 --> 02:07.361
Yeah, it's just not
gonna be the same

02:07.395 --> 02:09.497
without your running
commentary about sand.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.365
I am pretty
good at that.

02:11.399 --> 02:12.833
I'm, like, the
Seinfeld of the beach.

02:12.866 --> 02:14.502
(imitating Jerry Seinfeld):
"What's the deal with sand?

02:14.535 --> 02:16.170
"Just a bunch
of tiny rocks.

02:16.204 --> 02:18.639
"We're supposed to enjoy
walking on tiny rocks?

02:18.672 --> 02:20.641
"And then it gets
its own paper?

02:20.674 --> 02:22.176
Sandpaper?"

02:22.210 --> 02:23.411
WHITE JOSH:
Sounds just like him.

02:23.444 --> 02:26.680
(laughter)

02:26.714 --> 02:29.417
So are you leaving us hanging,
or are you coming with?

02:29.450 --> 02:30.918
All right.

02:30.951 --> 02:32.586
Yeah.
(whoops)
You win.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.722
At least we'll get
out of this town.

02:34.755 --> 02:36.524
And I can bring a friend.
There's this girl.

02:36.557 --> 02:37.958
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, a girl?

02:37.991 --> 02:39.393
An extra person?

02:39.427 --> 02:40.828
But that would mean
we'd have to take two cars.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.363
The classic crew
fits in one car.

02:42.396 --> 02:43.331
Firm no, dude.

02:43.364 --> 02:45.733
Why do we have to be
like Nazis about this?

02:45.766 --> 02:48.269
We've been doing the same
thing since we were 16.

02:48.302 --> 02:49.403
Oh, no.

02:49.437 --> 02:50.638
It's her.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.340
Oh, hey, Becks.

02:52.373 --> 02:53.474
VALENCIA:
What are you doing?

02:53.507 --> 02:54.975
Yeah.
Don't call her over.

02:55.008 --> 02:55.976
She's so weird.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.511
JOSH:
Be nice.

02:57.545 --> 02:58.512
VALENCIA: (sighs)
I don't understand

02:58.546 --> 03:00.514
why she keeps popping
up all over the place.

03:00.548 --> 03:01.915
Why did she move
here again?

03:01.949 --> 03:04.218
She was offered
a killer job in town.

03:04.252 --> 03:06.687
Why else would
she move here?

03:06.720 --> 03:09.523
* I was working hard
at a New York job *

03:09.557 --> 03:11.359
* Making dough
but it made me blue *

03:11.392 --> 03:13.227
* One day I was crying a lot

03:13.261 --> 03:14.462
* And so I decided to move

03:14.495 --> 03:15.963
* To West Covina, California

03:15.996 --> 03:17.498
* Brand-new pals
and new career *

03:17.531 --> 03:19.500
* It happens to be
where Josh lives *

03:19.533 --> 03:22.270
* But that's not why I'm here

03:22.303 --> 03:24.405
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *
What? No, I'm not.

03:24.438 --> 03:25.839
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *

03:25.873 --> 03:27.308
That's a sexist term.

03:27.341 --> 03:28.309
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *

03:28.342 --> 03:29.710
Can you guys stop singing
for just a second?

03:29.743 --> 03:32.546
* She's so broken inside *

03:32.580 --> 03:33.814
The situation's a lot more
nuanced than that.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.816
* C-R-A-Z-Y *

03:35.849 --> 03:37.418
Okay! We get it!

03:37.451 --> 03:39.320
* Crazy ex-girlfriend. *

03:39.353 --> 03:41.989
Hi. So did you guys just...
did you guys just see the movie?

03:42.022 --> 03:43.391
I loved the part

03:43.424 --> 03:44.758
where all
of the friends

03:44.792 --> 03:46.760
shave their heads in solidarity

03:46.794 --> 03:49.297
with the one friend
who was getting chemo.

03:49.330 --> 03:54.001
Like, I would totally do that if
I was in a crew with you guys.

03:54.034 --> 03:56.404
Or someone else, if I was
in just a separate group.

03:56.437 --> 03:59.940
Oh, hey, Becks, you have
a little, like, popcorn there.

03:59.973 --> 04:01.475
Where?

04:01.509 --> 04:02.476
It's just
a little...

04:02.510 --> 04:03.477
It's... it's right...
Where?

04:03.511 --> 04:04.478
Well, it's... it's, like...

04:04.512 --> 04:07.281
*

04:14.888 --> 04:16.857
(Josh and Rebecca laugh)

04:16.890 --> 04:18.559
It's just, like,
back there.
I'm sorry.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.394
It's so funny.
When I get down
to the dregs of the popcorn,

04:20.428 --> 04:21.562
I just drink the bucket.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.431
(laughs)
You know?

04:23.464 --> 04:25.032
Oh, man, I do that,
too, totally.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.700
Uh, just,
Valencia hates it.

04:26.734 --> 04:27.868
Right, babe?

04:27.901 --> 04:28.869
REBECCA:
Well, I should...

04:28.902 --> 04:29.970
I should get going.

04:30.003 --> 04:30.838
Wait.

04:30.871 --> 04:32.039
What?

04:32.072 --> 04:34.442
What are you doing Saturday?

04:35.843 --> 04:37.345
Nothing. Why?

04:37.378 --> 04:38.812
We're going to the beach.

04:38.846 --> 04:40.448
You should come.

04:40.481 --> 04:42.450
Really?
Really?

04:42.483 --> 04:44.352
What is happening?
REBECCA: Wait.

04:44.385 --> 04:48.489
You want me, Rebecca,

04:48.522 --> 04:51.892
to come to the beach
with you guys?

04:51.925 --> 04:52.960
Uh-huh.

04:52.993 --> 04:54.528
Yeah, I'd love to.

04:54.562 --> 04:55.729
Perfect.

04:55.763 --> 04:57.531
Josh will text
you the deets.
Yeah.

04:57.565 --> 04:58.866
Okay.
VALENCIA: Okay.

04:58.899 --> 05:02.636
Well, I'll see you guys
at the beach.

05:02.670 --> 05:03.604
Can't wait.

05:03.637 --> 05:04.605
Okay, bye.

05:06.106 --> 05:07.975
What was that?

05:08.008 --> 05:09.510
Yeah, what was that?

05:09.543 --> 05:10.844
I was just being nice
to a fellow woman.

05:10.878 --> 05:12.513
You can't invite
other people.

05:12.546 --> 05:13.581
What happened
to the rules of the crew?

05:13.614 --> 05:15.683
(scoffs) You guys are always
saying Rebecca's cool.

05:15.716 --> 05:18.018
And obviously she
has no friends.

05:18.051 --> 05:20.020
And I just decided
to be nice.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.555
Is that so hard
to believe?

05:21.589 --> 05:22.690
Uh...
No.

05:22.723 --> 05:24.024
No.
Nope.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.559
I can be nice to a girl.
No.

05:25.593 --> 05:27.060
We got to stick
together, you know?

05:29.129 --> 05:31.098
Give me that guitar.

05:31.131 --> 05:33.333
*

05:34.802 --> 05:38.639
* Women got to stick together

05:38.672 --> 05:40.808
* Each and every day

05:42.410 --> 05:45.379
* Women got to stick together

05:45.413 --> 05:49.383
* In each and every way

05:49.417 --> 05:52.520
* Females helping females

05:52.553 --> 05:56.390
* For the greater good

05:56.424 --> 05:59.860
* Sisters helping sisters

05:59.893 --> 06:04.465
* That's called sisterhood

06:04.498 --> 06:06.934
* Women have the power

06:06.967 --> 06:10.604
* The power to make a change

06:10.638 --> 06:13.941
* Like, this girl should
pluck her eyebrows *

06:13.974 --> 06:16.944
* And those jeans
should be exchanged *

06:16.977 --> 06:18.612
You really need
to size up.
(groans)

06:18.646 --> 06:21.615
* Some girls are born
tall and thin *

06:21.649 --> 06:25.018
* And some are short and fat

06:25.052 --> 06:28.689
* This girl smells
like sausages *

06:28.722 --> 06:31.659
* But there's nothing
wrong with that *

06:31.692 --> 06:35.663
* Women got to stick together

06:35.696 --> 06:39.667
* All across this land

06:39.700 --> 06:42.803
* Except Denise Martinez

06:42.836 --> 06:46.139
* That bitch I cannot stand

06:46.173 --> 06:47.675
Oh, hey, Denise.

06:47.708 --> 06:48.809
Hey, girl.

06:48.842 --> 06:51.812
* Females helping females

06:51.845 --> 06:54.815
* Like this girl here
with the blotchy face *

06:54.848 --> 06:56.149
(groans)

06:56.183 --> 06:58.686
* She banged her best
friend's boyfriend *

06:58.719 --> 07:01.822
* In the bathroom of that
half-priced sushi place *

07:01.855 --> 07:02.823
What?

07:02.856 --> 07:04.157
Oh, you didn't know?

07:04.191 --> 07:08.161
* So let's all spread
this message *

07:08.195 --> 07:11.832
* Like Caitlin spreads disease

07:11.865 --> 07:15.703
* 'Cause a change is
coming faster *

07:15.736 --> 07:19.172
* Than Ashley drops
to her knees *

07:19.206 --> 07:22.710
* Together we can
clear these hurdles *

07:22.743 --> 07:25.979
* Except Marisa,
'cause she's four-foot-eight *

07:26.013 --> 07:29.617
* We can climb every mountain

07:29.650 --> 07:32.620
* If the rope can support

07:32.653 --> 07:34.021
* Haley's weight

07:34.054 --> 07:35.255
What?

07:35.288 --> 07:38.792
* Women got to stick together

07:38.826 --> 07:42.229
* Do everything we can

07:42.262 --> 07:44.765
* So if some weird troll
named Rebecca *

07:44.798 --> 07:47.735
* Moves here from New York
and is all up on my boyfriend *

07:49.302 --> 07:53.941
* I'm gonna... lend her
a helping hand *

07:53.974 --> 07:57.077
* Women got to stick together

07:57.110 --> 08:01.081
* And tell each other
the truth *

08:01.114 --> 08:04.151
* The truth is
you're all fat sluts *

08:04.184 --> 08:06.854
* And that's called

08:06.887 --> 08:11.725
* Sisterhood.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.796
*

08:15.829 --> 08:18.599
So I'm trying to brainstorm what
I can bring to this beach day

08:18.632 --> 08:19.733
to really wow everyone.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.602
Oh, my gosh.

08:21.635 --> 08:23.837
The answer's clear now
that I'm talking out loud.

08:23.871 --> 08:26.173
Word games.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.708
Duh, of course.

08:27.741 --> 08:31.178
I mean, like, Scrabble,
Mad Libs, all the hits.

08:31.211 --> 08:32.712
Hell, maybe I'll even
bring Boggle.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.047
Right?

08:34.081 --> 08:35.582
Come on.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.049
This is my audition to be
in their friend group.

08:37.083 --> 08:38.184
Support me.

08:39.587 --> 08:41.688
All right, maybe
word games are lame.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.289
But number games...

08:43.323 --> 08:45.726
We're talking sudoku,
maybe some fraction flash cards.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.595
(gasps)
Oh, we could sing the pi song.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.196
* Three-point-one-four-
one-five-nine, two-six... *

08:49.229 --> 08:51.198
Snap out of it.

08:51.231 --> 08:54.201
Cookie, you are
fooling yourself.

08:54.234 --> 08:57.204
This is not an audition,
it is a trap.

08:57.237 --> 09:00.841
And Valencia is playing with you
like a cat with a chipmunk.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.109
See, I thought about that, too,

09:02.142 --> 09:04.111
but even if it is a trap,
I don't care.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.747
I'll just chipmunk my way...
out of that trap.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.582
Yeah, I don't care
how I got invited.

09:08.616 --> 09:10.718
The point is, I got invited.

09:10.751 --> 09:13.721
And I have a chance to be
in a real group of friends.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.055
Friends?

09:15.088 --> 09:16.790
Honey, they don't
care about you.

09:16.824 --> 09:19.793
And more to the point,
you don't care about them.

09:19.827 --> 09:21.962
They are just a stepping-stone
on the way to Josh.

09:21.995 --> 09:23.664
Oh, my God, no, they're not.

09:23.697 --> 09:26.667
Oh, God, I-I'm tired
of the ruse.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.803
You won't admit, even to me,
after all these months,

09:29.837 --> 09:32.606
that you are madly in love
with Josh Chan.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.708
And now you are
going to be

09:34.742 --> 09:37.678
willingly humiliated
by Vaseline.

09:37.711 --> 09:39.046
That's not her name.
You are just
setting yourself up

09:39.079 --> 09:40.948
for another one
of your disasters.

09:40.981 --> 09:44.685
What do you mean,
"another one of my disasters"?

09:44.718 --> 09:46.687
Taco Festival,
the spiders debacle,

09:46.720 --> 09:47.621
getting stuck in your
shrink's doggie door,

09:47.655 --> 09:49.690
begging a client
to sleep with your mother,

09:49.723 --> 09:51.725
and lest we forget
"Poopsgiving."

09:51.759 --> 09:55.328
Those were unfortunate
but random occurrences.

09:55.362 --> 09:58.866
No, if the same bad things keep
happening over and over,

09:58.899 --> 10:02.402
there is a reason for it,
and in your case, it is denial.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.872
And that is why everything
you do backfires.

10:04.905 --> 10:06.740
And you may be fine
continuing on this way,

10:06.774 --> 10:09.142
but I can't take it anymore.

10:09.176 --> 10:13.847
Until you admit that you
love Josh Chan, I'm out.

10:13.881 --> 10:15.883
Oh, my God, there's
nothing to admit.

10:15.916 --> 10:16.884
You want to keep lying?

10:16.917 --> 10:18.218
Fine.

10:18.251 --> 10:19.887
Lose my phone number.

10:21.789 --> 10:23.223
But just about the Josh stuff.

10:23.256 --> 10:24.892
I mean, we're still on for
mani-pedis at lunch, right?

10:24.925 --> 10:26.026
Yeah. Hey, uh, but wait.

10:26.059 --> 10:28.929
About the Josh stuff,
I am right, and you are wrong.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.931
I'm gonna have a great time
at the beach on Saturday

10:30.964 --> 10:33.233
with my friends.

10:33.266 --> 10:34.835
You're going to the
beach on Saturday?

10:34.868 --> 10:35.969
Wait, how'd you know that?

10:36.003 --> 10:37.104
Well, you just shouted it.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.405
Oh. Yeah.

10:38.438 --> 10:39.807
I was just wondering
if, you know,

10:39.840 --> 10:41.074
you wanted somebody
to tag along.

10:41.108 --> 10:42.275
I mean, I don't want to brag,

10:42.309 --> 10:43.310
but I make a mean bean dip.

10:43.343 --> 10:44.211
(laughs)

10:44.244 --> 10:46.346
It travels really well.

10:46.379 --> 10:48.281
Please?

10:48.315 --> 10:50.984
I mean, ever since my divorce
went through, it's just...

10:51.018 --> 10:52.119
I feel like something's missing.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.855
Yeah, I'm so sorry, Darryl,

10:54.888 --> 10:56.389
but we gotta kind of keep this

10:56.423 --> 10:58.826
in the main gang,
you know?

10:58.859 --> 10:59.860
It's like an inside crew thing.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.228
Oh, oh! I have an idea.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.163
Something you could use
to get me in with the group.

11:03.196 --> 11:04.832
You know what we did
for Madison's birthday

11:04.865 --> 11:06.299
that was a great deal?

11:06.333 --> 11:07.434
Oh, it was awesome.

11:07.467 --> 11:09.002
Everybody loved it.

11:09.036 --> 11:10.037
(imitates horn honking)

11:11.238 --> 11:12.439
(imitates honking)

11:12.472 --> 11:13.373
Party bus.

11:13.406 --> 11:15.308
We got a party bus.
It was so much fun.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.010
Oh... I could call 'em.

11:17.044 --> 11:19.980
Yeah, uh, Darryl,
that sounds fun,

11:20.013 --> 11:22.816
but, you know, you don't
have to try that hard

11:22.850 --> 11:24.484
to get people to like you.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.720
(horn blaring)

11:32.525 --> 11:34.127
Hey, guys.

11:34.161 --> 11:38.031
Did somebody order a party bus?

11:38.065 --> 11:40.067
Oh... my... God.

11:44.872 --> 11:45.873
Wait, wait, wait.
Is that... That's for us?

11:45.906 --> 11:46.840
No!

11:46.874 --> 11:48.108
It's for my other best friends.

11:48.141 --> 11:49.810
Oh, it's not...

11:49.843 --> 11:50.944
No, it's for you.

11:50.978 --> 11:51.945
Oh, it is for us.
(laughs)

11:51.979 --> 11:53.046
Awesome!

11:53.080 --> 11:54.948
Awesome, I've never been
in one of these.

11:54.982 --> 11:56.216
GREG:
Rebecca,
you shouldn't have.

11:56.249 --> 11:57.951
Seriously,
you shouldn't have,

11:57.985 --> 11:59.753
those buses are tacky
and horrible.

11:59.787 --> 12:01.454
Greg, come on,
it's gonna be a lot of fun.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.390
There's lots of stuff
on there you'll like,

12:03.423 --> 12:05.025
like alcohol.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.493
(laughing)

12:06.526 --> 12:07.494
Wait, where's, uh, Hector?

12:07.527 --> 12:09.329
Uh, he overslept, as usual.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.431
Oh, my God, that is so Hector.

12:11.464 --> 12:13.300
Wait, that is so Hector, right?

12:13.333 --> 12:14.902
Uh, yep. Yep.
Yeah.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.203
Great.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.270
Well, this looks amazing,

12:17.304 --> 12:19.206
so I'm gonna
hop on board

12:19.239 --> 12:20.373
and see what the situation is.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.374
Looks very cool.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.243
Come on, let's get on the bus,
it'll be fun.

12:23.276 --> 12:24.544
So when you want
to take one car,

12:24.577 --> 12:25.913
we're supposed to take one car,

12:25.946 --> 12:27.180
but when you want
to take a party bus,

12:27.214 --> 12:28.181
we're just supposed to do that?

12:28.215 --> 12:30.283
Right!
Well summarized.

12:30.317 --> 12:32.485
Great. Let's just go.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.321
Whoa, whoa. What's that?

12:34.354 --> 12:35.322
Craft beer?

12:35.355 --> 12:36.356
We don't drink that.

12:37.490 --> 12:39.893
It's gonna
be so fun.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.061
(whispering):
Smile.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.229
Yeah.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.297
Oh, ladies first...

12:44.331 --> 12:46.166
Thank you
so much, Rebecca.

12:46.199 --> 12:48.068
This was such a great idea.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.370
Usually Josh drives,
but now I can

12:50.403 --> 12:51.939
sit on his lap the whole time.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.440
That's really sweet...

12:53.473 --> 12:54.942
but you don't have
to sit on his lap.

12:54.975 --> 12:55.943
There are plenty of seats.

12:55.976 --> 12:58.011
But not much AC, right?

12:58.045 --> 13:00.447
'Cause I run very hot,

13:00.480 --> 13:02.449
so I should probably
lose some layers.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.020
(exhales)

13:07.054 --> 13:08.288
That's better.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.323
Wow, you just ripped
it off like that.

13:10.357 --> 13:11.859
Did you make that?

13:11.892 --> 13:13.193
Or did you buy that in a store?

13:13.226 --> 13:14.127
Did you, like,
buy that in a store

13:14.161 --> 13:16.163
that sells, like,
rip-off-able clothing?

13:16.196 --> 13:18.265
Anybody else?

13:18.298 --> 13:19.432
Anybody else for fun?

13:19.466 --> 13:21.468
Nope? Okay.

13:21.501 --> 13:22.903
Hey, guys,
let's sing the pi song

13:22.936 --> 13:24.137
all the way to the beach.

13:24.171 --> 13:25.438
* Three-point-one-four-
one-five-nine. *

13:25.472 --> 13:27.440
*

13:27.474 --> 13:29.309
REBECCA:
 Okay, so I could've gone
 with cheaper options,

13:29.342 --> 13:32.312
but I spare no expense
for ma homies.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.014
Let me show you what we got.

13:34.047 --> 13:36.083
So we got
12 cloudy martini glasses,

13:36.116 --> 13:38.986
we got four off-brand
bottles of cola,

13:39.019 --> 13:42.422
we got a standard-def TV
and laser disc player

13:42.455 --> 13:44.357
and then, finishing touch,
my favorite thing...

13:44.391 --> 13:46.359
And we're already
stuck in traffic.

13:46.393 --> 13:47.460
(various groans)

13:47.494 --> 13:49.196
What?
GREG:
But not to worry.

13:49.229 --> 13:50.998
I made an awesome playlist.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.966
I have a bunch of
cool new songs by new bands.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.002
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Songs we don't know?

13:55.035 --> 13:57.604
That-that we can't
sing along to?

13:57.637 --> 13:58.906
For a beach trip?

13:58.939 --> 14:00.974
Are you gonna hand
out sheet music?

14:01.008 --> 14:02.342
Like, how's that
gonna work?

14:02.375 --> 14:04.211
Hold up.

14:04.244 --> 14:05.445
Is that
a microphone?

14:05.478 --> 14:08.448
Time for a little beatbox!

14:08.481 --> 14:10.217
What?

14:10.250 --> 14:11.651
(zooming sound effect)

14:11.684 --> 14:12.886
(robotic voice):
Prepare yourself!

14:12.920 --> 14:13.887
You are now about to exp...

14:13.921 --> 14:15.422
(record scratch sound)

14:15.455 --> 14:16.423
Dr. RoboChan's prescription...

14:16.456 --> 14:17.424
(record scratch sound)

14:17.457 --> 14:19.426
...to get your body rockin'.

14:19.459 --> 14:20.627
(beatboxing)

14:20.660 --> 14:21.628
Oh, yeah!
Lookit!

14:21.661 --> 14:23.130
We're, like,
three minutes in

14:23.163 --> 14:24.297
and we're
already dancing!

14:24.331 --> 14:26.066
(Rebecca laughs, Josh beatboxes)

14:26.099 --> 14:27.901
(robot voice):
Oh, your...

14:27.935 --> 14:28.902
robotic sounds...

14:28.936 --> 14:30.470
are hypnotizing me.

14:30.503 --> 14:31.538
Someday

14:31.571 --> 14:34.241
I hope to become
sentient.

14:34.274 --> 14:35.943
Oh, wait, that hope

14:35.976 --> 14:37.677
is evidence
of sentience.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.379
Ha! Yeah!

14:39.412 --> 14:40.380
Wait, what?

14:40.413 --> 14:41.514
Hey, hey, you want
to get a pic

14:41.548 --> 14:42.983
for, like, the haters
out there?
Oh, yeah, come on.

14:43.016 --> 14:45.085
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

14:45.118 --> 14:46.954
Okay, let's do this.

14:46.987 --> 14:47.955
Yeah!

14:47.988 --> 14:48.956
Thanks, man.
Nice.

14:48.989 --> 14:51.491
*

14:51.524 --> 14:54.561
(beatboxing)

14:54.594 --> 14:55.595
(stops)

14:57.130 --> 14:59.399
Oh, cool,
you guys are dancing!

14:59.432 --> 15:00.500
Yeah, let me
get in there.

15:00.533 --> 15:02.569
Let's get in.
Let's let Rebecca in.

15:02.602 --> 15:04.137
Stop! Rebecca time!

15:04.171 --> 15:05.138
Okay...

15:05.172 --> 15:06.173
Okay, let's...

15:06.206 --> 15:08.441
Oh!
And... beep, beep.

15:08.475 --> 15:10.077
Tell the conductor
that the little caboose

15:10.110 --> 15:12.112
is trying
to latch on.

15:12.145 --> 15:13.580
Oh!

15:13.613 --> 15:15.048
Okay.

15:15.082 --> 15:16.383
Well, you guys
got this, so...

15:16.416 --> 15:17.584
I'm gonna let them...
I'm gonna let...

15:17.617 --> 15:18.718
They're having
couple time.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.020
You know what?

15:20.053 --> 15:21.254
I'm gonna sit
this one out.
You okay?

15:21.288 --> 15:22.990
Oh, yeah.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.557
(exhales)

15:24.591 --> 15:25.993
How you doing?

15:26.026 --> 15:27.494
Hi.
This is fun.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.696
I always like
to start my beach trip

15:29.729 --> 15:31.398
with a live sex show.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.966
REBECCA:
Oh, yeah,
it's super gross.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.134
It's like,
get a room.

15:34.167 --> 15:36.136
So how are you?

15:36.169 --> 15:37.304
Pretty great,
actually.

15:37.337 --> 15:38.605
Night school
is awesome--

15:38.638 --> 15:41.541
thank you for
that suggestion--

15:41.574 --> 15:44.111
and, um, there's some
other good stuff, too.

15:44.144 --> 15:46.113
Well, that's great.

15:46.146 --> 15:47.614
You know, I've always thought
you deserve to be happy.

15:47.647 --> 15:49.482
That's what I always say, Greg.
Oh, this is it!

15:49.516 --> 15:51.184
Can you take this exit, please?

15:51.218 --> 15:52.319
Huh? Exit?

15:52.352 --> 15:54.721
In that parking lot
right over there.

15:54.754 --> 15:56.123
JOSH:
Wait, what's going on?

15:56.156 --> 15:57.390
Uh, we're just gonna make
a quick stop.

15:57.424 --> 15:58.758
Wait, wait, wait.
We don't stop.

15:58.791 --> 16:01.094
We never stop, even
to go to the bathroom.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.762
You know our motto,
"Can't stop, won't stop."

16:02.795 --> 16:04.597
OMG, I love a group motto.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.566
"Can stop, are stopping."
That's not as catchy.

16:06.599 --> 16:07.534
Uh, be right... just a second.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.302
What'll be just a second?

16:09.336 --> 16:10.670
Dude, what'll be just a second?

16:10.703 --> 16:12.639
Why is he so cryptic?

16:12.672 --> 16:14.241
Hey, neighbor.

16:14.274 --> 16:16.043
GREG:
Heather, you know Josh,

16:16.076 --> 16:18.578
and this is Valencia
and White Josh.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.047
HEATHER:
Hi.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.114
What's up?

16:21.148 --> 16:23.016
Um, I thought we decided
this was a classic crew day.

16:23.050 --> 16:24.017
GREG:
No, you decided.

16:24.051 --> 16:25.218
And I decided
to bring a date.

16:25.252 --> 16:26.419
JOSH:
Wow. Okay.

16:26.453 --> 16:28.188
So this is just
the Wild West, then.

16:28.221 --> 16:29.522
(long whistle)

16:29.556 --> 16:31.024
This is so gross
and tacky.

16:31.058 --> 16:32.392
Hey.
Um, I'm sorry,

16:32.425 --> 16:35.095
I didn't know that you
and Greg knew each other.

16:35.128 --> 16:36.529
Oh.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.231
Yeah, we met
at your house.

16:38.265 --> 16:39.532
At your weird party.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.601
Oh... okay...

16:41.634 --> 16:43.036
Oh, so I'm the... got it.

16:43.070 --> 16:44.371
I'm the connector of you guys.

16:44.404 --> 16:45.372
You are welcome.

16:45.405 --> 16:46.406
Oh, yeah,

16:46.439 --> 16:48.508
and then we, like, hung
out over the holidays.

16:48.541 --> 16:49.509
Yep.

16:49.542 --> 16:50.610
You hung out over the hol...

16:50.643 --> 16:51.511
Oh. That's great.

16:51.544 --> 16:53.546
Is this, like, a date?

16:53.580 --> 16:55.548
Are you, are you guys dating?

16:55.582 --> 16:57.117
I don't know.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.751
Do people still
use that word?

16:58.785 --> 17:00.287
Uh, yeah.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.288
They... yeah.

17:01.321 --> 17:02.655
Cool, dating, yeah.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.523
Great! Okay.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.659
Uh, thank you for, uh, uh,
clearing that up.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.627
It... it is official.

17:08.661 --> 17:09.596
Mazel. Mazel.

17:09.628 --> 17:11.664
What?
Hey, date,
come on.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.099
I'm gonna get
you a drink

17:13.133 --> 17:14.434
in one of these
nice cloudy glasses

17:14.467 --> 17:16.336
that I think are clean
but I'm not really sure.

17:16.368 --> 17:18.371
Oh. Yeah.
But I'll take care of that.

17:20.307 --> 17:21.674
(kissing)

17:21.708 --> 17:23.576
(moans)

17:23.609 --> 17:25.612
You guys are so cute.

17:25.645 --> 17:26.746
Oh.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.781
Uh...

17:29.649 --> 17:31.618
Never seen side kissing.

17:31.651 --> 17:33.286
(indistinct conversations)

17:33.320 --> 17:35.488
Get away from
all these weirdos in there.

17:36.689 --> 17:38.658
Whoa, fancy trick.

17:38.691 --> 17:41.694
Hey, WhiJo!

17:41.728 --> 17:42.629
Let's rap!

17:42.662 --> 17:43.830
Let's talk.

17:43.863 --> 17:46.133
Really, this is a chance for
us to get to know each other.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.434
Tell me all about you.

17:47.467 --> 17:48.235
Don't skip anything.

17:48.268 --> 17:49.569
I want to know
what makes you tick.

17:49.602 --> 17:50.637
Didn't see that coming.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.105
Uh...

17:52.139 --> 17:53.806
I don't know where to begin.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.342
I guess the most important thing

17:55.375 --> 17:56.843
is that when I was six,

17:56.876 --> 17:57.710
I was a fat kid.
Oh.

17:57.744 --> 17:58.811
So when I was seven,

17:58.845 --> 18:00.613
I decided, you know,
it was time to tighten it up.

18:00.647 --> 18:03.483
No more junk food,
no more candy, no more...

18:03.516 --> 18:05.752
You know, I think there's
a real dilemma that we're facing

18:05.785 --> 18:06.819
with the way
we feed our children,

18:06.853 --> 18:08.155
and I was a victim
of...

18:08.188 --> 18:09.256
Oh, it's okay.

18:09.289 --> 18:10.257
Okay, let's,
uh, let's recap.

18:10.290 --> 18:12.459
So my first favorite exercise

18:12.492 --> 18:14.194
was Kettle Bell Swing,

18:14.227 --> 18:15.595
the second was
the Farmer's Carry.

18:15.628 --> 18:17.530
Four were burpees, but I think
I'm gonna go back on that...

18:17.564 --> 18:19.199
Whoa, guys!

18:19.232 --> 18:21.168
So much traffic, am I right?

18:21.201 --> 18:23.303
It's like, when will it end?

18:23.336 --> 18:25.772
(indistinct conversations,
laughter)

18:28.608 --> 18:30.543
You know what?
I am gonna take a risk

18:30.577 --> 18:32.645
and hit the old bus bathroom.

18:32.679 --> 18:33.780
Oh, no, but if you leave,

18:33.813 --> 18:37.284
I won't have anyone...

18:37.317 --> 18:39.652
(indistinct conversations,
laughter)

18:39.686 --> 18:41.688
(sighs)

18:47.727 --> 18:49.596
Oh, my God!
Guys, guys, guys, guys...

18:49.629 --> 18:50.763
Guys, guys, you have to stop
what you're doing.

18:50.797 --> 18:51.764
Stop what you're
doing right now,

18:51.798 --> 18:52.932
you have to look out the window.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.534
There is...
oh, my God, so funny.

18:54.567 --> 18:58.405
There is some, like,
loser in traffic

18:58.438 --> 18:59.639
and he's the one holding
everything up.

18:59.672 --> 19:00.773
Oh, my God.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.209
I mean, like, clearly,
he messed up.

19:02.242 --> 19:05.278
Like, what kind
of moron would...?

19:05.312 --> 19:06.813
Wait.

19:06.846 --> 19:07.847
Darryl?

19:09.449 --> 19:10.783
That's Darryl.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.552
Darryl could be a bus buddy,
someone to talk to...

19:12.585 --> 19:13.553
Stop the bus!

19:13.586 --> 19:14.754
Stop the bus!

19:14.787 --> 19:15.888
Hey, driver! Mister!

19:15.922 --> 19:17.357
Mr. Driver! Mr. Driver!

19:17.390 --> 19:18.591
Stop the bus. Stop the bus.

19:18.625 --> 19:19.792
Just stop it!

19:19.826 --> 19:20.560
Oh, you're getting off?

19:20.593 --> 19:21.894
That's probably
for the best.

19:21.928 --> 19:23.730
No, my boss is-is outside.

19:24.897 --> 19:26.799
No, listen, I-I need this, okay?

19:26.833 --> 19:27.834
I need help.

19:29.236 --> 19:30.603
For him.

19:30.637 --> 19:31.638
Oh...

19:33.740 --> 19:35.375
Thank you for stopping.

19:35.408 --> 19:36.776
Oh, it's like Xanadu.

19:36.809 --> 19:37.810
Hey!

19:37.844 --> 19:38.745
(laughs)

19:38.778 --> 19:40.680
What an uber-doober-coinkydinky

19:40.713 --> 19:43.316
to run into you
and your friendos, Rebecca!

19:43.350 --> 19:45.218
Ooh!
(laughs)

19:45.252 --> 19:46.753
(sighs)

19:46.786 --> 19:47.887
Hey.

19:54.794 --> 19:57.730
(car horns honking)

19:57.764 --> 20:00.500
This day has been
a nightmare.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.702
I mean, I just happened to
decide to go to the beach

20:02.735 --> 20:04.904
but then I was
so excited

20:04.937 --> 20:06.873
about hitting the rays
and catching the sun

20:06.906 --> 20:09.409
that, well, I didn't
happen to look

20:09.442 --> 20:10.543
at ye olde gas gauge.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.345
(laughs)

20:12.379 --> 20:14.747
Anyway, I pull over
to the side of the road,

20:14.781 --> 20:17.250
and then some people
in a car drive by

20:17.284 --> 20:18.918
and yell, "Hey!
Magnum P.I.!"

20:18.951 --> 20:20.653
Which I was actually
excited about,

20:20.687 --> 20:22.455
but then they flicked
a lit cigarette at me.

20:22.489 --> 20:23.656
But it's okay.

20:23.690 --> 20:25.592
It's okay, I-I caught it.

20:25.625 --> 20:26.759
Oh!

20:26.793 --> 20:28.761
Ugh.
Oh.
Wow.

20:28.795 --> 20:30.497
But I did rescue

20:30.530 --> 20:32.732
the classic beach
must-have, bean dip!

20:32.765 --> 20:35.001
And if you people
don't eat this,

20:35.034 --> 20:37.304
I'm gonna kill myself.

20:37.337 --> 20:38.771
So... here's hoping.

20:38.805 --> 20:40.507
(both chuckle nervously)

20:40.540 --> 20:41.341
REBECCA:
Okay, uh...

20:41.374 --> 20:43.343
can I just...
can I see you...
Sure.

20:43.376 --> 20:44.744
...for just a second.

20:44.777 --> 20:46.613
So I'm gonna ignore the fact
that you kind of creepily

20:46.646 --> 20:47.614
followed me to the beach...

20:47.647 --> 20:49.316
Oh, no, wait a minute.

20:49.349 --> 20:50.517
I didn't follow you
to the beach...

20:50.550 --> 20:51.518
It does... it does not matter.

20:51.551 --> 20:53.320
The point is, Darryl,

20:53.353 --> 20:55.288
I'm so glad you're here.

20:55.322 --> 20:56.356
Really?

20:56.389 --> 20:57.424
Oh, it's so nice

20:57.457 --> 20:58.425
to have a friend here, okay.

20:58.458 --> 21:00.493
(toilet flushes)
So, let's connect, let's talk,

21:00.527 --> 21:01.661
let's break past
that work barrier.

21:01.694 --> 21:03.430
WHITE JOSH:
Ah... Ah!

21:03.463 --> 21:06.399
It is hot in that bathroom.

21:06.433 --> 21:07.700
(scoffs)
Is that...

21:07.734 --> 21:08.968
You guys go in there yet?

21:09.001 --> 21:10.370
'Cause it's really hot.

21:10.403 --> 21:11.504
Oh, I'm sorry, he's terrible.

21:11.538 --> 21:13.573
It-It's like
he's allergic to shirts.

21:13.606 --> 21:14.641
Anyway...

21:14.674 --> 21:16.008
That's Josh Wilson.

21:16.042 --> 21:17.877
No, his name's White Josh.

21:17.910 --> 21:19.045
Wait, do you know him?

21:19.078 --> 21:20.513
You know him?

21:20.547 --> 21:21.748
He's a trainer at my gym.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.550
He is like my workout idol.

21:23.583 --> 21:24.717
He is my fitspiration.

21:24.751 --> 21:25.652
Oh, God.

21:25.685 --> 21:26.786
I'm telling you, I've just

21:26.819 --> 21:27.987
never had the nerve
to talk to him.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.622
It's just...
Hey, we got a new guy.

21:29.656 --> 21:30.857
Welcome aboard.

21:30.890 --> 21:33.760
Uh, do you work
at a 24-hour gym?

21:33.793 --> 21:35.462
I do, yeah.
On East Cameron?

21:35.495 --> 21:36.496
Yep, that's the one.

21:36.529 --> 21:37.530
Oh, my gosh, I...

21:37.564 --> 21:39.466
Oh, I have, like,
a million questions for you.

21:39.499 --> 21:40.433
Oh, yeah?

21:40.467 --> 21:41.634
Oh, my gosh.
What-What you got?
Hit me.

21:41.668 --> 21:42.502
Okay, first of all,

21:42.535 --> 21:44.337
how many pull-ups
can you actually do?

21:44.371 --> 21:46.473
Because I saw
you do 24 once.

21:46.506 --> 21:48.541
I don't want to overestimate,
but...

21:48.575 --> 21:49.642
Uh, maybe I do.

21:49.676 --> 21:51.911
Anyway, but, uh,
I saw you do 24.

21:51.944 --> 21:54.481
Yeah, yeah.
But I felt like you were really
only, like, halfway through.

21:54.514 --> 21:55.915
Depends on the workout,
but I'm at 57

21:55.948 --> 21:57.917
if you're just talking about
as many as I can do at once.

21:57.950 --> 21:59.486
That's-- I'm not,
I'm not satisfied with that.

21:59.519 --> 22:01.788
Hey, Darryl, Darryl,
I thought we were gonna hang.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.590
I can do, like,
two or three.
Yeah.

22:03.623 --> 22:05.425
DARRYL:
But I just get,
I get frustrated,

22:05.458 --> 22:06.893
and then I feel like
I hit this wall.

22:06.926 --> 22:08.695
WHITE JOSH:
Yeah, sure, sure.
You know what I mean?

22:08.728 --> 22:09.762
WHITE JOSH:
You got to commit.

22:09.796 --> 22:10.897
You said you go
to that gym?

22:10.930 --> 22:12.632
DARRYL:
I've been by it.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.033
I just...
Oh, oh, you're not a member?

22:14.066 --> 22:16.369
DARRYL:
Not a paid member, but I feel
like I know everybody there.

22:16.403 --> 22:18.671
Like the guy

22:18.705 --> 22:20.873
that-that does the-the thing
at the door with the guests.

22:20.907 --> 22:23.510
(conversation continues
indistinctly)

22:23.543 --> 22:25.044
Oh!

22:25.077 --> 22:26.579
(laughs)

22:30.483 --> 22:31.718
(squeals)

22:31.751 --> 22:33.720
(laughter)

22:36.756 --> 22:37.990
(chuckles)

22:38.024 --> 22:41.360
I got this.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.363
(rock music playing)

22:48.535 --> 22:49.602
What's happening?

22:49.636 --> 22:52.071
I don't know, but
I'm so excited.

22:52.104 --> 22:54.774
All eyes on me.

22:54.807 --> 22:56.743
Oh, they're on you.

23:01.581 --> 23:03.650
* Sweeter than honey
from a bumblebee *

23:03.683 --> 23:05.752
* You sting me every time
you move to the beat *

23:05.785 --> 23:07.654
Oh, my.
What?

23:07.687 --> 23:09.722
* I'm like a freight train
headed for your candy *

23:09.756 --> 23:10.757
* I want to taste it now

23:10.790 --> 23:13.693
* Your sweet love
shall be mine *

23:13.726 --> 23:15.828
* Gonna lick it
like a lollipop *

23:15.862 --> 23:18.030
* Tastes so good,
I'm never gonna stop *

23:18.064 --> 23:20.867
* Gonna have a little,
then a little more *

23:20.900 --> 23:23.836
* Of my fantasy,
yeah, it's your candy *

23:23.870 --> 23:27.674
* I want to taste

23:27.707 --> 23:30.109
* Your sweet temptation

23:30.142 --> 23:33.713
* Your love is my sugar

23:33.746 --> 23:35.948
* Your love is so sticky sweet

23:35.982 --> 23:39.852
* Your love is my sugar

23:39.886 --> 23:42.489
* Your love is all I need

23:42.522 --> 23:44.223
* Show me what you got

23:44.256 --> 23:46.058
* Show me all of your goods

23:46.092 --> 23:48.861
* Come a little closer,
and I'll take a look *

23:48.895 --> 23:50.697
This could not get
any more uncomfortable.

23:50.730 --> 23:52.665
* Make me weak

23:52.699 --> 23:54.967
* 'Cause your body is
my favorite treat *

23:55.001 --> 23:57.236
* Your love is my sugar

23:57.269 --> 23:59.839
* Your love is all I need

23:59.872 --> 24:01.874
* Your love is my sugar...

24:01.908 --> 24:03.476
Oh, that's, I think I just...

24:03.510 --> 24:05.578
I saw something, did you?
I think I saw inside of her.

24:05.612 --> 24:06.746
* Sticky sweet

24:06.779 --> 24:09.081
* Your love is my sugar

24:09.115 --> 24:13.219
* Your love is all I need.

24:13.252 --> 24:14.687
(panting)

24:14.721 --> 24:15.888
(chuckles)

24:20.226 --> 24:21.628
Not bad, eh?

24:21.661 --> 24:23.996
That was perfect.

24:26.132 --> 24:27.233
You're all probably wondering,

24:27.266 --> 24:28.568
like, how-how
I'm so good at that.

24:28.601 --> 24:29.936
Well, I took a class
in New York,

24:29.969 --> 24:32.238
and, I mean, not surprisingly,

24:32.271 --> 24:34.574
I got an "A."

24:34.607 --> 24:36.809
They give grades
in pole dancing?

24:36.843 --> 24:38.210
They do if you ask, yeah.

24:38.244 --> 24:41.113
Well, that was
really special.

24:42.549 --> 24:44.617
Guys, there's only one reason
she did that.

24:44.651 --> 24:46.819
Yeah, to get the party started
for my crew.

24:46.853 --> 24:49.121
By showing my boyfriend
your cervix?

24:49.155 --> 24:52.224
I don't think you understand
the female reproductive system.

24:52.258 --> 24:54.193
She just did that
so Josh could look at her

24:54.226 --> 24:55.294
and her boobs.

24:55.327 --> 24:56.629
What? No.

24:56.663 --> 24:58.931
No, I... No, I didn't.

24:58.965 --> 25:00.266
I wasn't doing
this for a guy.

25:00.299 --> 25:03.536
Oh, my God, who pole-dances
for male attention?

25:03.570 --> 25:05.037
Do you know the name

25:05.071 --> 25:06.138
of the class I took in New York?

25:06.172 --> 25:08.007
It was feminist pole dancing.

25:08.040 --> 25:08.975
Yeah, and as my teacher,

25:09.008 --> 25:12.278
a lovely trans woman
named Professor Goddess,

25:12.311 --> 25:13.345
said that true pole,

25:13.379 --> 25:16.549
true pole is about
reappropriating the male gaze.

25:19.986 --> 25:21.220
This is not normal!

25:21.253 --> 25:23.055
She is not normal!

25:23.089 --> 25:26.058
Why does Rebecca get a pass
for every crazy thing she does?!

25:26.092 --> 25:27.259
Come on, Valencia.

25:27.293 --> 25:28.961
So you don't like
my boyfriend, Rebecca?

25:28.995 --> 25:31.297
No, oh, my God.

25:31.330 --> 25:32.999
I have, like, told you.
Oh, no.

25:33.032 --> 25:34.967
I don't like your boyfriend.

25:35.001 --> 25:36.569
I just want to be his friend,

25:36.603 --> 25:39.005
just like I keep trying
to be your friend.

25:39.038 --> 25:40.607
Yeah, I think she was just
trying to have fun, you know?

25:40.640 --> 25:42.609
Having fun by hitting on you.

25:42.642 --> 25:44.043
Hitting on me?
Oh, my God, okay, Valencia,

25:44.076 --> 25:45.277
like, Valencia, seriously.

25:45.311 --> 25:46.278
Seriously,

25:46.312 --> 25:48.848
I am not into Josh.

25:48.881 --> 25:50.883
No.
Like, if I were into Josh,

25:50.917 --> 25:52.619
would I have hooked up

25:52.652 --> 25:54.954
with a faux vegetarian chef
from Echo Park?

25:54.987 --> 25:55.922
Or...

25:55.955 --> 25:56.923
if I were into Josh,

25:56.956 --> 25:59.058
would I have gotten together

25:59.091 --> 26:00.793
with a man named
Jason from Tinder?

26:00.827 --> 26:03.329
Oh, yeah, the little
hairy guy with the balls.

26:03.362 --> 26:05.364
So what?
That doesn't prove anything.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.366
Yeah, it does, it-it proves
that I am out there

26:07.399 --> 26:10.036
on the hunt for many
non-Josh people.

26:10.069 --> 26:12.238
That's a weird way
to phrase that.

26:12.271 --> 26:14.607
Admit it.
You're into Josh.

26:15.942 --> 26:17.176
If I were into Josh,

26:17.209 --> 26:19.779
would I have hooked up with Greg

26:19.812 --> 26:22.982
practically, like,
the first day I got here?

26:27.754 --> 26:29.956
This would never have happened
at the Getty.

26:29.989 --> 26:32.825
Wait, wait, wait,
you guys hooked up

26:32.859 --> 26:34.260
right when Rebecca moved here?

26:34.293 --> 26:35.962
If you could call it that.

26:35.995 --> 26:38.130
I would call it something

26:38.164 --> 26:41.033
that should never have been
spoken of on a party bus.

26:41.067 --> 26:44.070
'Cause I have spent a lot
of time talking to both of you

26:44.103 --> 26:46.072
about whether you should
date each other.

26:46.105 --> 26:48.174
Neither of you
ever thought to mention

26:48.207 --> 26:50.276
you had already hooked up?

26:52.044 --> 26:52.979
Why do you care?

26:53.012 --> 26:54.146
It's just weird.

26:54.180 --> 26:57.083
I mean, Rebecca has been my
friend for a long time, and...

26:57.116 --> 27:00.386
Josh, you never mentioned to me

27:00.419 --> 27:01.988
or anyone else

27:02.021 --> 27:04.156
that you and Rebecca
had dated years ago.

27:04.190 --> 27:06.859
Guys, let's stop talking
about this, okay?

27:06.893 --> 27:08.761
I-I'm sorry I brought that up.

27:08.795 --> 27:10.029
Let's-let's change the subject.

27:10.062 --> 27:12.699
Josh, I need to talk to you.

27:12.732 --> 27:14.333
Seriously, guys,

27:14.366 --> 27:15.668
this is my bad.

27:15.702 --> 27:17.169
Let's-let's talk
about something different.

27:17.203 --> 27:18.671
She's right. This is dumb.

27:18.705 --> 27:20.306
Heather, come on,
I'm gonna get you another drink.

27:20.339 --> 27:22.074
What was that look on your face
when you found out

27:22.108 --> 27:23.175
about Greg and Rebecca?

27:23.209 --> 27:24.310
What? Nothing. I was...

27:24.343 --> 27:26.412
Jealous. Yes.
I was not.

27:26.445 --> 27:27.847
I am not.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.315
I just don't like
secrets, okay?

27:29.348 --> 27:31.718
Just typical Greg,
so above it all.

27:31.751 --> 27:33.452
Not telling me stuff.
It's like, "Oh, I'm Greg.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.321
"I'm better than everyone.

27:35.354 --> 27:37.323
I read books and listen to
the talking radio station."

27:37.356 --> 27:39.058
Typical Greg.
This just has nothing

27:39.091 --> 27:40.259
to do with Greg.

27:40.292 --> 27:41.794
This has everything to do

27:41.828 --> 27:43.095
with your summer camp stalker
who won't go away.

27:43.129 --> 27:44.296
I'm just friends with her.

27:44.330 --> 27:45.431
I'm not doing anything.

27:45.464 --> 27:47.767
That's the problem.

27:47.800 --> 27:50.036
GREG:
I'm so tired of Josh's attitude.

27:50.069 --> 27:52.071
He can't tell me
who to hook up with.

27:52.104 --> 27:53.239
I'm a grown-ass man.

27:53.272 --> 27:55.207
He's out of line, right?

27:55.241 --> 27:58.044
You guys have a weird thing,
all of you.

27:58.077 --> 27:59.812
There's so much drama.

27:59.846 --> 28:01.213
I don't like it.

28:01.247 --> 28:03.916
I don't bring my baggage with me
to every date.

28:03.950 --> 28:07.486
Like, I would never bring you
to a party with Zeke.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.155
Who is Zeke?

28:09.188 --> 28:10.456
Exactly.

28:10.489 --> 28:12.191
DARRYL: I don't like
showering at the gym,

28:12.224 --> 28:13.492
because of all, like, the
athlete's foot and stuff.

28:13.525 --> 28:14.961
Sure, sure, you know what?

28:14.994 --> 28:16.162
Flip-flops.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.496
Keep them in your car.

28:17.529 --> 28:19.398
Oh, my God, great tip.

28:19.431 --> 28:20.800
Yeah, isn't it?

28:20.833 --> 28:22.234
Oh, my God,
you're like a chess player

28:22.268 --> 28:23.836
who kind of sees, like,
ten steps ahead.

28:23.870 --> 28:25.304
(indistinct chattering)

28:25.337 --> 28:28.340
Hey, I-I'm just gonna go
to the bathroom,

28:28.374 --> 28:30.977
if anyone's looking for me.

28:31.010 --> 28:32.879
Um...

28:34.146 --> 28:36.148
Just get my music.

28:37.349 --> 28:39.318
Can I have my shirt back, Greg?

28:39.351 --> 28:41.453
Yeah, sure.

28:41.487 --> 28:43.489
Thanks.

28:50.496 --> 28:52.498
(phone rings)

28:54.801 --> 28:56.268
Yes?

28:56.302 --> 28:58.170
Hey, Paula.

28:58.204 --> 29:00.773
Could you come get me?

29:10.983 --> 29:12.084
(car horns honking)

29:15.287 --> 29:16.322
Look at him.

29:16.355 --> 29:17.957
Staring at me.
(groans)

29:17.990 --> 29:19.225
Focus on
the main event, okay?

29:19.258 --> 29:20.559
Rebecca.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.128
Rebecca didn't ruin this day.

29:22.161 --> 29:24.296
She brought a party bus
and just wanted everyone

29:24.330 --> 29:25.264
to have fun.

29:25.297 --> 29:26.933
Greg ruined it.

29:26.966 --> 29:28.400
He brought a date
and some weird beer,

29:28.434 --> 29:30.236
tried changing our music.

29:30.269 --> 29:31.503
You can't mess
with classic beach day

29:31.537 --> 29:33.172
and expect nothing to happen.

29:33.205 --> 29:35.474
It's like he's never seen
 The Butterfly Effect.

29:35.507 --> 29:37.009
This is Josh's fault.

29:37.043 --> 29:39.278
Underneath
that laid-back attitude,

29:39.311 --> 29:41.280
he's really controlling
and bossy.

29:41.313 --> 29:43.582
I mean, why does he get
to call all the shots?

29:43.615 --> 29:45.084
Because he's likeable?

29:45.117 --> 29:46.986
Who cares about being likeable?

29:47.019 --> 29:48.387
You don't seem to.

29:48.420 --> 29:50.289
I dig that.

29:51.223 --> 29:52.358
Hey, Paula.

29:52.391 --> 29:54.160
I really need you to pick me up.

29:54.193 --> 29:55.427
Of course.

29:55.461 --> 29:57.129
(sighs)
Oh, thank you so much.

29:57.163 --> 29:58.430
You're such a lifesaver.

29:58.464 --> 30:00.199
As soon as you admit
you love Josh.

30:00.232 --> 30:01.567
What?

30:01.600 --> 30:03.469
I told you I am tapped out

30:03.502 --> 30:05.437
with the lying and the denial.

30:05.471 --> 30:06.906
You get realsies with me, Bunch,

30:06.939 --> 30:08.307
or I am still outskies with you.

30:08.340 --> 30:10.977
No, Paula, wait,
you can't do this to me.

30:11.010 --> 30:12.344
You love him. Say it.

30:12.378 --> 30:14.346
No.
Say you love him.

30:14.380 --> 30:16.015
No!
Do it!

30:16.048 --> 30:17.183
I just want to be his friend,
just like I want

30:17.216 --> 30:18.017
to be all of their friends.

30:18.050 --> 30:20.219
Why don't you understand me?
(groans)

30:21.220 --> 30:22.588
Paula? Are you...

30:22.621 --> 30:23.990
Paula?

30:24.023 --> 30:26.525
Did you hang up?

30:26.558 --> 30:28.460
She hung up on me.

30:30.462 --> 30:32.899
GREG: Look, and now he just
took the last craft beer,

30:32.932 --> 30:34.400
which he said
he didn't even want.

30:34.433 --> 30:36.335
That bastard.

30:36.368 --> 30:38.037
I'm so pissed at him,

30:38.070 --> 30:39.371
I'm gonna drink
the last craft beer,

30:39.405 --> 30:41.340
even though it tastes
like thick, soapy shampoo.

30:41.373 --> 30:42.508
What are you doing?
No, give it to me.

30:42.541 --> 30:43.475
What are you doing? Dude.
Give it to me.

30:43.509 --> 30:44.576
I was gonna drink it.
Give me, give me that!

30:44.610 --> 30:46.378
What are you gonna do?
You wouldn't appreciate this.

30:46.412 --> 30:47.479
'Cause your palate froze

30:47.513 --> 30:50.382
in 2006, when you drank
too many Slurpies in a row.

30:50.416 --> 30:52.084
(laughs) You don't need
a palate to drink a beer.

30:52.118 --> 30:53.252
You need a glass.

30:53.285 --> 30:54.520
That's right, genius.

30:54.553 --> 30:55.888
Oh, so now I'm dumb?

30:55.922 --> 30:57.089
No, not now, always.

30:57.123 --> 30:58.624
Why do we always have to do
what you want to do?
Ow.

30:58.657 --> 31:00.192
We always drive in your car.

31:00.226 --> 31:01.393
We always are listening
to your horrible music.

31:01.427 --> 31:02.528
You're mean.

31:02.561 --> 31:04.430
You're mean and bitter.

31:04.463 --> 31:06.465
And yet somehow,
you're Mr. Popular.

31:06.498 --> 31:07.967
You charm everybody.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.969
Finally a new girl
comes to town,

31:10.002 --> 31:12.238
and surprise, you've already
Channed all over her.

31:12.271 --> 31:14.406
Well, she was
my childhood sweetheart,

31:14.440 --> 31:15.507
and you Gregged her.

31:15.541 --> 31:16.575
Sweetheart? Oh, my God.

31:16.608 --> 31:18.577
Please, just stop talking
about freaking Rebecca.

31:18.610 --> 31:20.512
And why did you blame me?

31:20.546 --> 31:22.081
I'm not your mom
who left you,

31:22.114 --> 31:23.549
and I'm not the reason
you still live with your dad

31:23.582 --> 31:24.650
and work at a bar.

31:24.683 --> 31:26.986
I'm in night classes,
you jerk!

31:27.019 --> 31:27.853
Don't yell at me, man.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.088
Back off!
All right, that's enough.

31:29.121 --> 31:30.522
Stop, stop, stop!

31:30.556 --> 31:33.392
You guys have been friends
since kindergarten.

31:33.425 --> 31:35.394
And he's been a sarcastic dick
the whole time!

31:35.427 --> 31:36.963
And he still hasn't
grown up ever!

31:36.996 --> 31:39.398
And you've never
fought like this!

31:39.431 --> 31:41.167
What's different
about today, huh?

31:41.200 --> 31:44.703
Why are you fighting
like this now?

31:44.736 --> 31:48.274
What's the new element today?

31:48.307 --> 31:49.341
Oh, no, is it me?

31:49.375 --> 31:50.509
No, no, no, you're cool, bro.

31:50.542 --> 31:51.543
It's definitely not me.

31:51.577 --> 31:52.711
I didn't do anything.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.380
I'm a student.

31:54.413 --> 31:56.548
What are you even doing here?

31:56.582 --> 31:59.485
You invited me, remember?

31:59.518 --> 32:01.187
No, I don't mean the bus.

32:01.220 --> 32:03.422
Why are you even in our lives?

32:03.455 --> 32:05.958
Because you're my friends.

32:05.992 --> 32:07.726
No, we're not.
(chuckles)

32:07.759 --> 32:10.129
No one really knows you.

32:10.162 --> 32:13.399
How did you get to West Covina?

32:13.432 --> 32:16.735
I got on a plane

32:16.768 --> 32:20.472
and then I got to LAX,
because Burbank was sold out,

32:20.506 --> 32:23.542
so then I got on a taxi
and I took it to West Covina

32:23.575 --> 32:25.411
and there was a lot of traffic
and I paid $180

32:25.444 --> 32:27.613
and next time I'll do
a-an airport shuttle.

32:27.646 --> 32:31.050
Why did you move here, Rebecca?

32:31.083 --> 32:34.220
What's the real reason?

32:37.089 --> 32:39.225
I told you!
Oh, my God!

32:39.258 --> 32:40.559
I was in New York,

32:40.592 --> 32:41.760
and I was looking
to relocate to Los Angeles...

32:41.793 --> 32:43.262
I was looking to relocate
to Los Angeles,

32:43.295 --> 32:44.696
because I'm just,
I'm a beach gal.

32:44.730 --> 32:46.065
I ran into Josh...

32:46.098 --> 32:47.599
Got a really great offer
from Darryl.

32:47.633 --> 32:49.468
I get a random call from
a 1/8 Chippewa offering me

32:49.501 --> 32:51.737
a job in West Covina,
just like randomly!

32:51.770 --> 32:53.339
What?

32:53.372 --> 32:54.706
You called me.

32:54.740 --> 32:57.176
I remember
Karen came in

32:57.209 --> 32:59.378
and she said,
"The Big Apple's on the line!"

32:59.411 --> 33:00.612
And then you said,

33:00.646 --> 33:02.614
"Is there any way you would
consider me for your law firm?

33:02.648 --> 33:04.750
"Because I'll work
for super cheap.

33:04.783 --> 33:06.718
I just really want to live
in West Covina."

33:06.752 --> 33:08.754
That's what you said.

33:15.461 --> 33:17.496
You called him?
You've always said...

33:17.529 --> 33:20.532
Wait, wait, wait-- you always
said that he called you

33:20.566 --> 33:23.602
and offered you a job,
and that's why you moved here.

33:33.679 --> 33:36.582
So you mean,
you bumped into me

33:36.615 --> 33:38.684
in New York that day,

33:38.717 --> 33:41.187
and from that
one conversation,

33:41.220 --> 33:44.756
decided to move
to my hometown?

33:45.791 --> 33:47.293
(Valencia chuckles)

33:47.326 --> 33:49.328
Wow!

33:49.361 --> 33:52.698
This is exactly what I thought
would happen when I invited you.

33:52.731 --> 33:56.368
A part of me was hoping
that I was wrong.

33:56.402 --> 33:58.670
But no.

33:58.704 --> 34:02.541
You're just as crazy
as I thought.

34:02.574 --> 34:04.310
JOSH:
No, it's probably

34:04.343 --> 34:06.112
not a big deal.
I mean, there's an explanation.

34:06.145 --> 34:07.379
Right, Rebecca?

34:07.413 --> 34:09.348
Is there an explanation?

34:11.317 --> 34:13.152
Yeah, yes, there is, okay?

34:13.185 --> 34:14.286
It's the truth.

34:16.355 --> 34:19.858
The truth is...

34:19.891 --> 34:23.161
I was miserable in New York.

34:23.195 --> 34:26.697
I was so depressed.

34:26.732 --> 34:29.368
And all I did was-was work.

34:29.400 --> 34:30.668
I had no life.

34:30.702 --> 34:33.804
The world was just,
like, gray.

34:33.839 --> 34:36.408
And then I ran into you, Josh.

34:36.442 --> 34:38.377
And-and you told me
about West Covina,

34:38.409 --> 34:41.647
and-and you kept
using the word "happy."

34:41.679 --> 34:45.150
And I hadn't, like,
thought about that word

34:45.184 --> 34:47.319
in so long
and-and it just, like,

34:47.353 --> 34:49.521
reverberated within me.

34:49.554 --> 34:53.458
And so that day,
I-I made the decision that I...

34:53.492 --> 34:57.229
I had to be
where the happiness was.

34:57.263 --> 35:00.366
So I put feelers out
and I got a job here.

35:00.399 --> 35:02.268
Wow.

35:03.469 --> 35:05.804
Look, was it impulsive?

35:05.837 --> 35:07.339
Yes.

35:07.373 --> 35:08.407
Was it crazy?

35:08.440 --> 35:09.741
I don't like that term.

35:09.775 --> 35:12.511
But the point is,

35:12.544 --> 35:16.182
guys, it's the best decision
I've ever made.

35:17.283 --> 35:18.817
I love it here.

35:18.850 --> 35:20.452
I love it.

35:20.486 --> 35:21.620
I love the sunshine.

35:21.653 --> 35:23.789
I love the strip malls where
you can get a foot massage

35:23.822 --> 35:25.257
and a smoothie
and a new key made

35:25.291 --> 35:26.758
in, like, less than 20 minutes.

35:26.792 --> 35:28.627
I love driving
on the freeway.

35:28.660 --> 35:31.797
I love what the dry heat
does to my hair.

35:31.830 --> 35:35.201
I love everything
about this place, okay?

35:35.234 --> 35:38.437
So the reason that I'm here,
the real reason that I'm here?

35:38.470 --> 35:40.606
It's not logical,
it's not rational.

35:40.639 --> 35:41.840
I'm in love.

35:45.411 --> 35:47.413
With West Covina.

35:49.381 --> 35:51.350
Why didn't you just
tell us the truth?

35:51.383 --> 35:53.452
I mean, you see
how bonkers it sounds.

35:53.485 --> 35:55.354
I didn't want you all
to think I was crazy,

35:55.387 --> 35:57.189
because I want to be
your friend.

35:58.890 --> 36:00.492
Oh, hey, dudes.

36:00.526 --> 36:02.160
We're here.

36:04.430 --> 36:07.266
Do you guys get it?

36:09.000 --> 36:11.537
Do you understand
why I haven't

36:11.570 --> 36:13.939
been completely forthcoming?

36:13.972 --> 36:15.941
You guys get it, right?
Greg, Greg, you-you get it.

36:15.974 --> 36:18.710
I don't even know anymore.

36:18.744 --> 36:21.947
It's been a weird day.

36:21.980 --> 36:23.815
Greg, come on.

36:23.849 --> 36:25.451
Come on, Heather.

36:25.484 --> 36:26.918
Let's go get spray-on bikinis.

36:26.952 --> 36:27.953
HEATHER:
Okay.

36:27.986 --> 36:31.290
Thanks for the party bus,
neighbor.

36:31.323 --> 36:34.293
I'll see ya.

36:34.326 --> 36:37.463
Hey, man, about earlier...

36:37.496 --> 36:39.431
Oh... don't worry, it's cool.

36:39.465 --> 36:40.799
You know, from now on,

36:40.832 --> 36:42.701
you bring whatever
you want, I mean--

36:42.734 --> 36:45.203
you know, people,
beverages, music.

36:45.971 --> 36:48.640
Come on, Greg me.

36:48.674 --> 36:50.842
Oh, so you want
to get Gregged now?

36:52.478 --> 36:54.480
Well, I'm ready for the beach.

36:56.415 --> 36:58.550
Look, if you want me to keep
a secret, you should tell me.

36:58.584 --> 37:00.419
I'm good with secrets.

37:00.452 --> 37:02.388
(quietly):
Thanks.

37:05.757 --> 37:08.660
Go ahead, Josh, tell her.

37:09.795 --> 37:11.463
She's a liar,
and we don't want

37:11.497 --> 37:12.664
to hang out with
her anymore.

37:16.668 --> 37:19.505
Valencia,
give me a second.

37:19.538 --> 37:22.274
I need to talk
to Rebecca.

37:22.308 --> 37:23.609
Yeah, that's right.

37:23.642 --> 37:25.544
Tell her off in private.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.579
She deserves it.

37:35.921 --> 37:37.989
Josh, I'm so sorry

37:38.023 --> 37:40.559
that I lied.

37:40.592 --> 37:43.061
But the real reason

37:43.094 --> 37:45.597
that I moved here
sounds so insane...

37:45.631 --> 37:46.965
But, see, that's just the thing.

37:46.998 --> 37:49.034
I-I don't think
it's insane at all.

37:49.067 --> 37:52.471
Wait, what?

37:52.504 --> 37:55.507
Rebecca, I lived in New York,
remember?

37:55.541 --> 37:57.576
I know what it's like.

37:57.609 --> 38:00.612
It's tough and-and it's cold.

38:00.646 --> 38:03.382
And, you know, when you
wear shorts to the office,

38:03.415 --> 38:05.517
people give you a funny look.

38:07.018 --> 38:08.654
I've spent my whole life

38:08.687 --> 38:10.789
defending this town
to people like Greg.

38:11.923 --> 38:13.892
Do you have any idea

38:13.925 --> 38:17.028
how proud I am to be the one
who told you about this place?

38:18.597 --> 38:22.000
* West Covina

38:22.033 --> 38:26.505
* California

38:26.538 --> 38:29.875
* It's so cool
you see the bounty *

38:29.908 --> 38:33.512
* Of the best town
in L.A. County *

38:33.545 --> 38:37.516
* It's nirvana,
it's heaven, it's Mecca *

38:37.549 --> 38:41.453
* Yeah, I'm hopelessly,
desperately in love *

38:41.487 --> 38:43.855
* With

38:43.889 --> 38:47.693
* West Covina

38:47.726 --> 38:50.996
* Can't believe
that a girl like you *

38:51.029 --> 38:51.930
* Ah-ah

38:51.963 --> 38:52.931
* Would think this place

38:52.964 --> 38:54.566
* Is a dream come true

38:54.600 --> 38:55.634
* Ah-ah

38:55.667 --> 38:56.702
* Or be swayed by a guy

38:56.735 --> 38:59.371
* Like me

38:59.405 --> 39:02.608
* It's not just a coincidence

39:02.641 --> 39:05.076
* It isn't just by chance

39:05.110 --> 39:07.613
* It's logical, it's obvious

39:07.646 --> 39:09.681
* It all makes perfect sense

39:09.715 --> 39:12.651
* And I'm just so happy

39:12.684 --> 39:14.553
* That you're

39:14.586 --> 39:18.824
* Here.

39:21.192 --> 39:23.161
Well, I, I better go.

39:23.194 --> 39:26.164
Um, let's keep
this convo between us.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.767
Valencia wouldn't understand.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.936
Okay.

39:30.969 --> 39:33.839
But I wanted you to know,

39:33.872 --> 39:37.476
I'm so happy
that you're in town.

39:37.509 --> 39:40.946
And I don't think
you're crazy at all.

40:07.673 --> 40:08.740
You okay?

40:09.908 --> 40:11.910
(chuckles)

40:12.978 --> 40:15.581
(chuckles)

40:17.816 --> 40:20.719
So, you were right.

40:20.752 --> 40:23.722
It was a disaster.

40:27.826 --> 40:30.028
But, God,

40:30.061 --> 40:32.531
Josh was so nice.

40:37.202 --> 40:41.072
He found out
that I've been lying,

40:41.106 --> 40:44.810
and instead of turning
his back on me...

40:44.843 --> 40:47.445
he just opened up more.

40:51.817 --> 40:53.819
He was so warm

40:53.852 --> 40:57.556
and kind and understanding.

41:03.529 --> 41:06.865
I love him so much.

41:07.833 --> 41:09.935
(sighs)

41:09.968 --> 41:11.970
I know, sweetie.

41:12.003 --> 41:14.005
Oh.

41:18.810 --> 41:20.812
Okay, honey, let's go home.

41:22.714 --> 41:23.882
Oh, you look so tired.

41:23.915 --> 41:25.183
Yeah.

41:25.216 --> 41:27.118
You can nap in the car.

41:27.152 --> 41:29.154
Okay.

41:32.223 --> 41:36.094
Don't ever lie to me again.

41:36.127 --> 41:38.129
Okay, Mama.

41:44.135 --> 41:46.738
(alarms blaring)

41:54.713 --> 41:56.047
(knocking)

41:56.081 --> 41:58.249
WOMAN:
Hector, wake up!

41:58.283 --> 42:00.786
You've been sleeping
for 15 hours!

42:01.820 --> 42:04.122
Wake up, Hector!
Oh, crap.
