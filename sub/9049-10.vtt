WEBVTT

00:04.537 --> 00:08.507
Hey, we should do something special
for our anniversary this year.

00:08.509 --> 00:09.641
We totally should!

00:09.643 --> 00:12.311
Ooh! Picnic in a
hot air balloon?

00:12.313 --> 00:14.279
I meant me and Ally.

00:14.281 --> 00:17.349
Oh. Her.

00:17.351 --> 00:21.653
Yeah, "her."

00:21.655 --> 00:24.390
Wait, which anniversary are we celebrating?
The day we met?

00:24.392 --> 00:26.325
No, not the day we met.

00:26.327 --> 00:27.459
It should be the day
we started dating.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.261
The first time or
the second time?

00:29.263 --> 00:31.263
I'm not sure.

00:31.265 --> 00:33.966
Why don't we just pick a random
day that has no special meaning?

00:33.968 --> 00:37.503
Like, uh, November 29th.

00:37.505 --> 00:39.338
That's my birthday.

00:40.974 --> 00:42.207
Duh.

00:42.209 --> 00:44.877
Now it'll be extra special.

00:44.879 --> 00:45.978
Love you.

00:48.948 --> 00:52.584
Guess who got Ally a gig
performing at this year's MVMA's?

00:52.586 --> 00:54.653
I'm a little tired of
your guessing games.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.755
Just tell us who
got her the gig!

00:56.757 --> 01:00.459
Trish, that's incredible!

01:00.461 --> 01:04.263
I can't believe I'll be performing
at the Miami video music awards.

01:04.265 --> 01:06.331
You have to come up with
something really cool, Ally.

01:06.333 --> 01:09.334
The MVMA's are all about the
big, over-the-top performances.

01:09.336 --> 01:12.571
Last year, Katy Perry did the
splits on top of a rhino.

01:12.573 --> 01:15.474
And then the rhino did the
splits on top of an elephant!

01:15.476 --> 01:18.811
Doing the splits
isn't that hard.

01:22.749 --> 01:24.316
Here, let me help.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:21.307 --> 02:24.376
So, then you jump on the
dancing clown's shoulders

02:24.378 --> 02:26.678
just before the lion gets a
chance to bite your head off.

02:28.449 --> 02:31.016
Or, we'll fill the whole
place up with water,

02:31.018 --> 02:32.818
and do a swim dance
with a shark.

02:38.424 --> 02:40.926
I like that you're
both thinking big,

02:40.928 --> 02:44.530
but maybe we should stick to something
a little less life-threatening.

02:46.332 --> 02:49.101
Uh. If I could just build
on what Ally's saying,

02:49.103 --> 02:51.770
your ideas are terrible,
and we're not doing them.

02:53.540 --> 02:54.673
Hey, guys!

02:54.675 --> 02:56.341
I'm going back to L.A. tomorrow,

02:56.343 --> 02:57.676
- so I made goodbye smoothies.
- Ooh.

02:57.678 --> 03:00.374
They have blueberries,
bananas, and my tears.

03:00.405 --> 03:03.148
I couldn't stop crying
while I was making them.

03:03.150 --> 03:05.384
- No thanks.
- Not thirsty.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.753
- I'm good.
- I'll take one.

03:07.755 --> 03:09.121
Mmm.

03:09.123 --> 03:11.490
Salty.

03:11.492 --> 03:13.458
It's too bad you can't stay
for the MVMA's next week.

03:13.460 --> 03:14.860
Oh, I'd love to go.

03:14.862 --> 03:17.396
I'd be able to see my
favorite singer perform.

03:17.398 --> 03:19.965
Oh, thanks!

03:19.967 --> 03:21.366
Oh, you're performing, too?

03:21.368 --> 03:22.901
I was talking about Becky G.

03:25.772 --> 03:28.473
Hey, I have an idea of how you
could stay in town longer.

03:28.475 --> 03:29.109
It's an award show.

03:29.140 --> 03:31.643
You could be the girl that hands all
the trophies to all the winners.

03:31.645 --> 03:34.146
Yeah! I'll be the
trophy-passer-outer!

03:34.148 --> 03:36.748
Yay! You're staying
in town longer!

03:38.585 --> 03:41.420
Um, I hate to ruin
such a sweet moment,

03:41.422 --> 03:45.090
but you can't just decide to
be the trophy-passer-outer.

03:45.092 --> 03:46.758
They have to hire
you to do that.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.527
Aww.

03:48.529 --> 03:50.562
Guess you're going back to L.A.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.598
But I'm not ready
to say goodbye.

03:54.935 --> 03:56.835
Here we go again.

03:56.837 --> 03:59.771
Maybe I can call the producers
and get Carrie an audition?

03:59.773 --> 04:01.940
Oh, that would be great!
You'll nail it!

04:01.942 --> 04:04.142
All you have to do is look pretty
and hand things to people.

04:04.144 --> 04:06.478
I can hand things to people.

04:08.815 --> 04:10.549
Here's your award.

04:12.418 --> 04:13.619
One more.

04:13.621 --> 04:15.053
Here's your award.

04:16.154 --> 04:17.422
One more.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.491
Here's your award.

04:19.493 --> 04:20.591
One more.

04:21.494 --> 04:23.662
Well, she looks pretty.

04:23.664 --> 04:25.797
Here's your award.

04:25.799 --> 04:26.932
One more.

04:29.535 --> 04:32.437
Thanks for getting Carrie the audition.
I hope she gets it.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.606
If she doesn't, she has
to go back to L.A.

04:34.608 --> 04:38.010
Then it'll just be me and you
hanging out all the time.

04:38.012 --> 04:40.045
Please don't drop the trophy,
please don't drop the trophy...

04:40.047 --> 04:41.513
Next!

04:47.086 --> 04:48.487
I did it!

04:48.489 --> 04:50.656
Yes! I knew she could do it.

04:50.658 --> 04:51.825
I mean, her name's "Carrie."

04:51.856 --> 04:53.955
She was named after the
word for carrying stuff.

04:54.894 --> 04:56.628
I've made my decision.

04:58.564 --> 05:00.666
This photo represents the girl

05:00.668 --> 05:04.803
who will be the MVMA's next
top trophy-passer-outer.

05:06.539 --> 05:07.572
Carrie!

05:07.574 --> 05:09.741
You did it, babe!

05:09.743 --> 05:12.477
Now you get to stay in Miami
for another two weeks.

05:12.479 --> 05:13.779
Boop.

05:13.781 --> 05:16.782
Way to walk 10 feet without
dropping anything.

05:16.784 --> 05:19.818
Thanks. I used a
secret technique.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.653
Glue.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.955
What are you gonna do
the night of the show?

05:23.957 --> 05:27.259
How are you gonna give the winners their
trophies if it's glued to your hands?

05:27.261 --> 05:29.661
Huh. I guess I wasn't thinking.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.229
So, what else is new?

05:31.231 --> 05:32.664
Eh, not much.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.166
I'm taking DJ lessons.

05:40.807 --> 05:42.107
Ally!

05:42.109 --> 05:42.789
Sheila Berman.

05:42.820 --> 05:45.510
Super psyched you're gonna
be performing this year.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.612
- Oh, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

05:47.614 --> 05:49.548
Me and Ally have been
working on a lot of ideas.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.249
I'm gonna do a
huge dance number.

05:51.251 --> 05:54.886
I'm gonna have backup dancers, and
cool costumes, and special effects.

05:54.888 --> 05:56.621
It's gonna be a
performance to remember.

05:56.623 --> 05:58.757
Yeah, that's all great.

05:58.759 --> 06:00.826
I just have one teeny-tiny note.

06:00.828 --> 06:01.960
You won't be doing any of that.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.595
- Say what now?
- Come again?

06:03.597 --> 06:04.663
You're Ally Dawson.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.064
You're not a huge
dance number girl.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.899
You're a "sit at the
piano and sing" girl.

06:07.901 --> 06:10.302
- But I...
- Sorry, nobody wants to see you dance.

06:10.304 --> 06:11.603
Good talk.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.807
What exactly was good
about that talk?

06:23.015 --> 06:25.550
No. No. No.

06:25.552 --> 06:26.426
No!

06:26.457 --> 06:29.921
Um, excuse me Sheila, can we
talk about my performance?

06:29.923 --> 06:32.624
Oh, the one were you sit at the
piano and sing and do nothing else?

06:32.626 --> 06:34.626
Uh, about that.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.613
I don't want to appear
ungrateful, but I would

06:36.644 --> 06:39.815
appreciate it if you at least gave me
a chance to show you what I can do.

06:39.846 --> 06:42.667
<i>I've seen what you can do.
You're the Ally way girl.</i>

06:42.669 --> 06:47.205
I know a lot of people think that,
but I've come a long way since then.

06:47.207 --> 06:50.709
The MVMA's is my chance to let everyone
know I can do a lot more than just

06:50.711 --> 06:52.310
this.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.814
That's the one. Always
makes me laugh.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.282
Me too.

07:00.720 --> 07:03.321
Me and Ally can put together
a really great routine

07:03.323 --> 07:04.589
that will blow everyone away.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.858
I'll tell you what. No.

07:06.860 --> 07:09.194
Come on, Sheila.

07:09.196 --> 07:10.363
Give us a couple of days.

07:10.394 --> 07:13.632
Let Ally come back and show you
the performance she wants to do.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.167
I know she can change your mind.

07:15.169 --> 07:16.601
What have you got to lose?

07:16.603 --> 07:18.203
Fine.

07:18.205 --> 07:20.939
Come back Friday, but it better
not be a waste of my time.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.040
Good talk.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.682
Okay. So, we have a few
days to prove to her

07:24.694 --> 07:27.345
that I can pull off a
huge dance number.

07:27.347 --> 07:29.247
Either you'll have a great
routine for the show,

07:29.249 --> 07:31.783
or we'll have a really funny
video of you dancing badly.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.185
It's a win-win!

07:40.860 --> 07:41.507
Look, Ally.

07:41.538 --> 07:44.095
If we wanna prove to the world
that you're the real deal,

07:44.097 --> 07:45.764
we have to step things up.

07:45.766 --> 07:48.166
You'll need some cool moves.
Like this.

07:59.011 --> 08:00.946
Okay, Carrie. I vouched for you.

08:00.948 --> 08:02.781
So, you better not embarrass me.

08:02.783 --> 08:05.684
Dez, you have one week to teach her
how to carry a trophy 10 feet.

08:05.686 --> 08:07.285
Okay, Carrie.

08:07.287 --> 08:09.754
I bought a bunch of cheap
trophies to practice with.

08:09.756 --> 08:12.057
If we work together, there's
nothing we can't do.

08:12.059 --> 08:15.193
Really? Can you teach
me how to fly?

08:16.262 --> 08:18.230
Okay, there's one
thing we can't do.

08:27.740 --> 08:29.841
Oh, sorry, sorry!

08:29.843 --> 08:32.110
It's cool. It didn't hurt.

08:37.250 --> 08:38.383
You can do it, babe.

08:38.385 --> 08:40.751
Left foot, right foot.

08:52.766 --> 08:55.033
Great. One more
time from the top?

08:55.035 --> 08:56.234
Again?

08:56.236 --> 08:58.837
Okay. I can do this.

09:07.713 --> 09:08.747
Ally!

09:08.749 --> 09:09.848
Okay, I'm up!

09:22.728 --> 09:24.829
I did it, I did it!

09:24.831 --> 09:26.898
One out of 50. Getting better.

09:38.844 --> 09:42.747
And the award for best
performance goes to Ally.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.215
Aww.

09:44.217 --> 09:45.850
Number one grandpa?

09:45.852 --> 09:47.419
Ooh, can I have that?

09:47.421 --> 09:49.921
I know the perfect
person to give that to.

09:49.923 --> 09:50.923
My mom.

09:53.861 --> 09:54.942
Oh, I know I can do better.

09:54.972 --> 09:57.225
I'm gonna take a break and
then practice some more.

10:00.066 --> 10:02.901
I don't think she's gonna
be ready by tomorrow.

10:02.903 --> 10:05.470
I guess you have to tell her she's
gonna have to scrap her big dance

10:05.472 --> 10:07.772
and stick to singing
a song at the piano.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.240
I can't tell her that.

10:09.242 --> 10:10.508
You tell her.
You're her manager.

10:10.510 --> 10:12.110
You tell her. You're
her dance teacher.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.878
I can't tell her,
I'm her boyfriend.

10:13.880 --> 10:16.114
Well, I can't tell her,
I'm her best friend.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.382
Ooh, ooh! Can I tell her?

10:17.384 --> 10:18.416
No!

10:18.418 --> 10:19.212
Aww.

10:19.243 --> 10:22.417
I guess we'll just have to
figure something else out.

10:26.892 --> 10:28.927
- Hey, Ally.
- What'cha doing?

10:28.929 --> 10:31.162
The audition's in a
couple of hours.

10:31.164 --> 10:33.365
I'm just trying to
relax and decompress.

10:33.367 --> 10:34.566
- Huh.
- Oh.

10:34.568 --> 10:36.301
How long are you
gonna do that for?

10:38.337 --> 10:41.806
Uh, not sure. The main thing
is that I need total silence.

10:43.876 --> 10:45.143
So, that's relaxing, huh?

10:46.912 --> 10:48.079
Dez, stop talking.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.948
Ally needs complete quiet.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.850
Thank you, Austin.

10:53.819 --> 10:54.886
Is it working now?

10:54.888 --> 10:56.388
You know what...

10:56.390 --> 10:58.957
Maybe I'll do this
somewhere you guys aren't.

11:03.029 --> 11:04.462
Guess who's got bad news.

11:04.464 --> 11:06.264
Is everything okay?

11:06.266 --> 11:07.042
What's going on?

11:07.073 --> 11:10.001
Sheila just called and
canceled your audition.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.102
- What?
- Really?

11:11.104 --> 11:12.137
Oh, come on.

11:12.139 --> 11:14.239
Wait, why? What did she say?

11:14.241 --> 11:16.307
She just wants you to
do a song on piano.

11:16.309 --> 11:18.143
I tried, but she wouldn't budge.

11:18.145 --> 11:21.279
She's not gonna even give me a
chance to show her what I can do?

11:21.281 --> 11:23.381
Sorry, Ally.

11:25.584 --> 11:26.251
You know what?

11:26.282 --> 11:28.920
I'm gonna call her and ask
why she changed her mind.

11:28.922 --> 11:31.022
- You don't wanna do that.
- Uh, we shouldn't cause trouble.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.358
Hey, Ally, there's really
no point in calling.

11:33.360 --> 11:37.162
Besides, she's a big time producer,
there's no way she's gonna answer...

11:37.164 --> 11:38.229
<i>Sheila Berman.</i>

11:38.231 --> 11:41.066
Hi, Sheila, this is Ally Dawson.

11:41.068 --> 11:44.536
I think you owe me an explanation
as to why you canceled my audition.

11:44.538 --> 11:46.408
<i>Uh, I didn't cancel
your audition.</i>

11:46.439 --> 11:50.241
<i>Trish called me and said you were
canceling because you weren't ready.</i>

11:50.243 --> 11:53.912
Uh, Sheila, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.413
<i>Good talk.</i>

11:56.515 --> 11:59.617
I'm sorry, Ally, but we were
just trying to protect you.

11:59.619 --> 12:00.652
We?

12:00.654 --> 12:01.541
Sorry.

12:01.572 --> 12:05.090
I just didn't think we had
time to get it right.

12:05.092 --> 12:07.025
I don't want you to
embarrass yourself.

12:07.027 --> 12:09.327
Wow.

12:09.329 --> 12:13.498
I guess if you all feel that way about
my performance, then maybe it's true.

12:13.500 --> 12:17.035
I can't do it. Thanks for sparing
me all that embarrassment.

12:23.476 --> 12:25.043
Wow.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.112
You guys stink at
delivering bad news.

12:27.114 --> 12:28.369
You gotta be more direct.

12:28.400 --> 12:32.013
Like me, just now, when I said you
stink at delivering bad news.

12:45.197 --> 12:49.267
Welcome to the 13th annual
Miami video music awards!

12:53.339 --> 12:55.106
Thanks again for helping
Carrie get this gig.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.474
You're a good friend.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.009
Well, not to Ally.

12:58.011 --> 12:59.291
You were really horrible to her.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.247
I was just trying
to protect her.

13:02.249 --> 13:03.715
Hey, don't get all defensive.

13:03.717 --> 13:05.116
I'm just trying
to say thank you.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.551
Hey, guys.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.286
Aww, flowers for me?

13:08.288 --> 13:10.455
No. I got them for Ally.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.957
Oh. Her.

13:12.959 --> 13:15.093
But I guess you might
as well take them.

13:15.095 --> 13:16.561
She wouldn't let me
in her dressing room.

13:16.563 --> 13:19.097
I can't believe Ally's
still not talking to us.

13:19.099 --> 13:19.964
It's been days!

13:19.966 --> 13:21.466
I feel terrible.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.134
We made the right decision.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.103
Not every singer has
to be a great dancer.

13:25.105 --> 13:28.206
I know, but she's never
been this mad at me.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.175
What if she never
talks to me again?

13:32.444 --> 13:35.513
So, I can still have
those flowers, right?

13:41.086 --> 13:45.323
Ladies and gentlemen, once more,
please, silence all cell phones.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.624
Hey, babe.

13:46.626 --> 13:48.760
Aww, you got me flowers?

13:48.762 --> 13:50.161
Huh?

13:50.163 --> 13:53.164
Oh, right. Yup. They're for you.

13:53.166 --> 13:56.334
I wasn't gonna put them in the
empty vase next to my bathtub...

13:58.170 --> 13:59.571
So, are you ready
to go out there?

13:59.573 --> 14:01.139
I think so.

14:01.141 --> 14:03.074
You'll be great.

14:03.076 --> 14:05.176
As long as you remember
the code we came up with.

14:05.178 --> 14:09.314
P.U.T.W.A.S. W.T.D.D.T.H.T.T.W.

14:09.316 --> 14:09.976
Right.

14:10.007 --> 14:12.617
Pick up trophy. Walk
across stage with trophy.

14:12.619 --> 14:15.119
Don't drop trophy.
Hand trophy to winner.

14:15.121 --> 14:17.355
T.M.G.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.523
That's my girl.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.525
Oh!

14:20.527 --> 14:25.663
And the award for most epic video
co-starring a wild animal goes to...

14:25.665 --> 14:27.599
Chandelier Baker!

14:30.070 --> 14:32.670
This is it, babe. Go get 'em!

14:56.295 --> 14:58.763
Ladies and gentlemen,
Ally Dawson.

17:04.022 --> 17:07.290
That was amazing, Ally.

17:07.292 --> 17:09.327
<i>I always thought of you as
just the Ally way girl,</i>

17:09.329 --> 17:10.528
but you killed it out there.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.630
Thanks, Becky G.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.365
I'm such a big fan.

17:14.367 --> 17:17.868
You know, people used
to call me "Ally D."

17:19.471 --> 17:21.606
Okay, nobody used
to call me that.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.307
- Bye.
- Bye.

17:25.277 --> 17:27.578
- Ally, that was amazing!
- That was so good!

17:27.579 --> 17:29.714
Wait, wait, not so fast.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.816
I'm still upset that you
guys didn't believe in me.

17:31.818 --> 17:34.385
I was really hurt
by what you did.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.421
Ally, I'm so sorry I
ever doubted you.

17:36.423 --> 17:37.555
Me too.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.390
I'm sorry I went
behind your back,

17:39.392 --> 17:40.925
but I swear we were just
trying to help you.

17:40.927 --> 17:43.327
I know. I get it.

17:43.329 --> 17:46.132
You know, when I found out
what you did, I was so mad.

17:46.163 --> 17:49.734
It motivated me to push
myself and get it together.

17:49.736 --> 17:54.972
So, if I tell you you can't do
something, it makes you want to do it?

17:54.974 --> 17:58.776
Well, I bet you can't do my math homework
and bake me a batch of cupcakes?

17:58.778 --> 18:01.579
Not gonna happen. Nice try.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.915
So, we're good?

18:09.254 --> 18:09.941
Welcome back.

18:09.972 --> 18:12.690
It's time to announce the
final award of the evening.

18:12.692 --> 18:16.327
The nominees for most epic
video of the year are...

18:16.329 --> 18:18.863
<i>Heart Potato, Tiny Tina K.</i>

18:20.299 --> 18:23.534
<i>Bouncy Bouncy, Willis,
featuring Glow Baby.</i>

18:25.304 --> 18:27.805
<i>And You plus Me equals We</i>

18:27.807 --> 18:30.775
by Marshall Frumpkin and the
Frumpkin Family singers.

18:34.413 --> 18:38.850
And... the... winner... is...

18:39.985 --> 18:42.420
Marshall Frumpkin and the
Frumpkin Family singers!

18:49.461 --> 18:52.463
Oh, no! There are
like, 10 Frumpkins!

18:52.465 --> 18:54.499
I can't carry 10 trophies.

18:55.467 --> 18:57.435
You can if I carry you.

18:57.437 --> 18:58.703
Hop up.

19:00.839 --> 19:02.406
Load her up, Trish.

19:22.996 --> 19:25.062
Why didn't you just
wheel the trophies out?

19:25.064 --> 19:26.931
That's why they
were on that cart.

19:28.967 --> 19:32.370
Oh...

19:35.507 --> 19:39.112
<i>Thank you. It's been a great
show, and here to close it out,</i>

19:39.143 --> 19:42.480
performing her hit song can't
stop dancing, is Becky G.!

21:55.047 --> 22:00.217
Guys, look at this! I'm
all over the Internet!

22:02.354 --> 22:05.956
Your MVMA performance has even more
hits than the sneezing panda video.

22:05.958 --> 22:08.125
I still can't believe
how amazing you were.

22:08.127 --> 22:09.927
I wanna watch it again.

22:09.929 --> 22:13.197
Ooh. Looks like the panda's
newborn baby just sneezed.

22:13.199 --> 22:14.832
Guess you're back to number two.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.634
Eh, oh well.

22:16.636 --> 22:19.036
I had my nanosecond in the sun.

22:20.239 --> 22:21.272
<i>Achoo!</i>

22:21.274 --> 22:23.741
Aww!

22:23.743 --> 22:24.875
<i>Achoo!</i>

22:24.877 --> 22:27.144
Aww!

22:27.146 --> 22:28.612
<i>Achoo!</i>

22:28.614 --> 22:31.015
Aww!

22:32.217 --> 22:33.517
<i>Achoo!</i>

22:34.305 --> 22:40.487
