(indistinct radio transmission)

00:41.942 --> 00:44.978
(indistinct radio transmission)

00:44.978 --> 00:48.782
(flies buzzing)

01:02.930 --> 01:04.598
MAN:
Holiday weekends

01:04.598 --> 01:06.734
are notoriously busy
for the police.

01:06.734 --> 01:09.637
Our officers had made plans
for the weekend,

01:09.637 --> 01:12.406
(flies buzzing)
but they were derailed.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.908
* Daisy and Ben

01:14.908 --> 01:16.377
* In bed

01:16.377 --> 01:17.745
No.
* Yeah

01:17.745 --> 01:19.180
No. Play me a real song.

01:19.180 --> 01:20.748
I played you my CD.

01:20.748 --> 01:21.849
That's not the same thing.

01:21.849 --> 01:23.184
Play me one.

01:23.184 --> 01:25.486
You'll hear me tonight.

01:25.486 --> 01:27.321
Maybe. Maybe.
(stammering)

01:27.321 --> 01:29.590
I don't know. I might.

01:30.958 --> 01:32.960
You really gonna be there?

01:32.960 --> 01:34.828
Yeah, I'm gonna be there.

01:34.828 --> 01:36.430
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

01:41.835 --> 01:43.937
Hey, Clete, you make
sure you buckle up.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.839
You're driving.

01:45.839 --> 01:48.142
(chuckling)

01:49.943 --> 01:51.879
(car remote chirps)

01:56.384 --> 01:58.586
You going to work?

01:58.586 --> 01:59.887
Now?

01:59.887 --> 02:01.121
(exhales)

02:01.121 --> 02:04.258
Our day starts
when your day ends.

02:11.299 --> 02:13.901
(birds chirping)

02:16.370 --> 02:18.239
You want some coffee?

02:18.239 --> 02:19.707
Yep.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.612
That's a great color.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.148
Coffee, dude. Now.

02:36.857 --> 02:38.359
Hey.

02:38.359 --> 02:39.960
So, how's it going over there?

02:39.960 --> 02:41.295
You meet that actress yet?

02:41.295 --> 02:43.631
Nah, she's in Toronto
making a film.

02:43.631 --> 02:45.866
So, you coming
tonight, or what?

02:45.866 --> 02:47.368
Got to be here, brother.

02:47.368 --> 02:48.702
It's not the same without you.

02:48.702 --> 02:53.741
(man and woman arguing loudly)

02:53.741 --> 02:55.976
Is that Larry and Bridget
fighting again?

02:55.976 --> 02:57.278
Yep.

02:57.278 --> 02:59.079
I don't miss that.

02:59.079 --> 03:00.648
Yeah, tell me about it.

03:00.648 --> 03:02.149
(Larry and Bridget shouting)

03:02.149 --> 03:03.784
Hey, doll.
Hey.

03:03.784 --> 03:06.320
You're bringing the tri-tip
tonight, right?
I got it.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.955
Don't forget to marinade it.

03:10.491 --> 03:12.360
She says you got to come home,

03:12.360 --> 03:14.962
stop all this
nonsense.

03:14.962 --> 03:16.230
She misses you.

03:16.230 --> 03:17.265
We all do.

03:17.265 --> 03:18.666
I'll try to make it, okay?

03:18.666 --> 03:20.568
Not good enough--
you're gonna be here.

03:20.568 --> 03:22.503
I want you to see
my new barbecue.

03:22.503 --> 03:25.573
It's beautiful-- I got her used,
but I can fix her up.

03:33.514 --> 03:34.648
Hey.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.784
Can you help me grill later?

03:36.784 --> 03:37.918
No.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.820
You know, there was a time

03:39.820 --> 03:42.356
when you used to love
working side by side

03:42.356 --> 03:43.791
by the old grill master.

03:43.791 --> 03:47.027
(groans):
Oh, stop embarrassing yourself.

03:47.027 --> 03:50.030
Attendance is mandatory, Kimmy.

03:50.030 --> 03:52.165
Forget it--
I made plans two weeks ago.

03:52.165 --> 03:53.701
Absolutely not.

03:53.701 --> 03:55.936
It's a family tradition;
the whole block's coming.

03:55.936 --> 03:58.872
Do you even know what
this holiday's about? Huh?

03:58.872 --> 04:01.575
We honor those who
gave up their lives

04:01.575 --> 04:02.943
defending our country.

04:02.943 --> 04:04.678
Like I give a shit.

04:04.678 --> 04:05.546
Mom!

04:05.546 --> 04:08.549
Sal, she made plans.

04:09.450 --> 04:11.585
No... So break 'em.

04:12.820 --> 04:14.588
(frustrated groan)

04:17.291 --> 04:19.259
I hate you.

04:23.297 --> 04:25.032
Nice.

04:25.032 --> 04:29.069
(Larry and Bridget shouting)
Do you hear that?
Do you...

04:29.069 --> 04:30.838
I'm going over there.

04:30.838 --> 04:32.440
Where's the
friggin' respect?

04:32.440 --> 04:35.208
It's Memorial Day,
for crying out loud.

04:35.208 --> 04:38.646
What are you doing
this weekend?

04:38.646 --> 04:41.715
Uh, my friend Daisy
has a concert tonight.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.917
Daisy? You still
seeing her?

04:43.917 --> 04:45.986
Yeah.

04:45.986 --> 04:48.021
She your girlfriend now?

04:48.021 --> 04:50.591
Yeah. You know what, I like her.

04:50.591 --> 04:52.225
Yeah, she's great.
She's smart...

04:52.225 --> 04:54.895
Yeah? So why can't you
say she's your girlfriend?

04:54.895 --> 04:56.129
(chuckles)

04:56.129 --> 04:59.032
(chuckles)

04:59.032 --> 05:00.067
Hey.

05:04.171 --> 05:08.509
My car broke down, and I-I got
to be someplace and I'm late.

05:08.509 --> 05:10.411
Well, uh, sir, step
away from the car, sir.

05:10.411 --> 05:12.913
I just told you,
I have an appointment.

05:12.913 --> 05:13.981
I need a ride.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.182
Right now.

05:15.182 --> 05:16.917
We're not a taxi
service, sir.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.118
Fine. Call me a cab.

05:18.118 --> 05:20.454
You're a cab.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.324
Fuck's wrong
with you guys, man?

05:24.324 --> 05:25.959
Fuck you guys, bitches?!

05:25.959 --> 05:26.960
Fuck you!

05:31.832 --> 05:32.733
(heavy sigh)

05:32.733 --> 05:34.935
You're not gonna
believe this.

05:34.935 --> 05:36.470
They let Marta go.

05:36.470 --> 05:37.838
That's not possible, bro--

05:37.838 --> 05:39.607
we had her on ten
different charges--

05:39.607 --> 05:40.841
sales, possession,
gang injunction...

05:40.841 --> 05:42.643
None of them
were "no bail."

05:42.643 --> 05:44.978
She paid it--
a million bucks.

05:44.978 --> 05:47.748
Well, what about I.S.?
She's freakin' illegal.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.950
Asylum. The lawyer
told the court

05:49.950 --> 05:52.586
that if they deported her
back to Mexico again,

05:52.586 --> 05:53.721
cartel would kill her.

05:53.721 --> 05:55.523
ANDY:
This is
so screwed up.

05:55.523 --> 05:57.224
Bring us your tired,
your poor, your...

05:57.224 --> 05:58.358
huddled masses

05:58.358 --> 05:59.627
dying to deal drugs.

05:59.627 --> 06:01.562
The wretched refuse
of your teeming shore.

06:01.562 --> 06:02.863
Yeah, you think this is funny?

06:02.863 --> 06:04.898
Huh?

06:04.898 --> 06:06.734
She and her
freakin' sons

06:06.734 --> 06:08.902
have tried to take
out Janilla twice.

06:08.902 --> 06:11.605
Now she's got to wait for trial
again while this monster's

06:11.605 --> 06:14.074
out on bail?

06:14.074 --> 06:16.410
This sucks!

06:16.410 --> 06:18.779
Calm down, Sammy.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.848
She's safe with you.
She's not safe with me.

06:20.848 --> 06:22.816
Tammi's out God knows where.

06:22.816 --> 06:25.185
She refuses to keep a
gun anywhere near her

06:25.185 --> 06:26.219
in the house.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.988
Yeah, says it's bad Karma.

06:27.988 --> 06:30.090
It invites violence.

06:31.459 --> 06:32.826
Um, I finished
my homework,

06:32.826 --> 06:35.596
so I'm gonna go work out
with the Explorers.

06:35.596 --> 06:36.530
Good girl.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.932
Stay close.

06:38.932 --> 06:40.267
Why?

06:40.267 --> 06:42.903
'Cause I said so.

07:02.355 --> 07:03.390
Stupid bitch moved.

07:03.390 --> 07:04.758
There's cops everywhere.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.760
You think it's easy
to smoke somebody

07:06.760 --> 07:08.228
in the middle
of downtown?

07:08.228 --> 07:10.063
Man!

07:10.063 --> 07:13.834
You can't handle
a chubby little girl.

07:23.977 --> 07:26.179
(gunshot)

07:29.416 --> 07:31.118
We need
a continuance, sir.

07:31.118 --> 07:33.320
I'm still preparing...
A continuance?
This is bullshit!

07:33.320 --> 07:35.055
I'm sorry.
We were ready
to go to trial.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.957
We were ready,
and now you're not ready?

07:36.957 --> 07:38.792
All right. How much
time do you need?

07:38.792 --> 07:40.127
Enough time to kill our witness.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.062
You think you can
get it done in a week?

07:42.062 --> 07:43.864
Come on, Sammy.
Y-You can sleep at night,

07:43.864 --> 07:45.699
you're, like, knocking off kids?

07:45.699 --> 07:47.768
Detective Bryant!
Or is... or is Marta

07:47.768 --> 07:50.103
threatening you, too?
JUDGE:
Enough, Detective!

07:52.205 --> 07:54.141
(Sammy sighs)

07:55.208 --> 07:57.144
(horn honking outside)

07:58.211 --> 08:00.981
(indistinct radio transmission)

08:05.152 --> 08:07.154
What's your problem?

08:07.154 --> 08:09.823
You need to go home sick.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.059
You need to just
relax-- I'm fine.

08:12.059 --> 08:14.895
Besides, I'm kind of
out of sick days.

08:14.895 --> 08:17.931
Okay, so take a T.O.
I'm out of overtime!

08:17.931 --> 08:20.768
I don't care!
I can smell the
booze on you!

08:20.768 --> 08:23.203
From two days ago!

08:23.203 --> 08:25.539
I haven't had a drink
since yesterday.

08:25.539 --> 08:27.374
I hit rock bottom, okay?

08:27.374 --> 08:28.842
I'm taking care of this.

08:28.842 --> 08:32.680
Yesterday. You just
said two days ago.

08:34.548 --> 08:36.984
I got a couple of
days off coming up.

08:36.984 --> 08:39.519
All right? I'll handle
it then, I promise you.

08:41.421 --> 08:43.724
(indistinct radio transmission)

08:43.724 --> 08:45.425
I'm telling you,
he is fine, girl.

08:45.425 --> 08:46.794
Mm, I don't know.

08:46.794 --> 08:50.063
Oh, come on, they're not
all idiots like Talib.

08:50.063 --> 08:52.132
Hey, I'm cooking, too,
mac and cheese.

08:52.132 --> 08:54.968
Mmm!
Four kinds of cheeses,
just the way you like it.

08:54.968 --> 08:57.605
Oh, my God.
Ribs, turkey burgers.

08:57.605 --> 08:59.072
The four-cheese mac?
See?

08:59.072 --> 09:01.408
We're gonna have to run
an extra ten miles.

09:01.408 --> 09:02.743
(laughs)
All right.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.678
Last one has to
pay for lunch.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.279
You got that,
you got that.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.215
Wait! Hold... Wait!

09:08.215 --> 09:10.417
I'll try to get
an administrative order

09:10.417 --> 09:11.852
for her removal.
Excellent.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.420
If that doesn't work,
I'll reach out

09:13.420 --> 09:14.788
to an immigration judge I know,

09:14.788 --> 09:16.356
see about getting
her hearing bumped up.

09:16.356 --> 09:17.691
We already tried that.

09:17.691 --> 09:18.959
She got asylum.

09:18.959 --> 09:20.828
Well, ain't that a bitch.

09:20.828 --> 09:22.763
Money laundering,
IRS...

09:22.763 --> 09:24.097
Conspiracy,

09:24.097 --> 09:25.733
RICO-- you're the Feds,
for God's sakes.

09:25.733 --> 09:26.934
And I'm on it, guys.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.335
Look, you know how many years

09:28.335 --> 09:30.203
we've been trying
to put Marta Ruiz away?

09:30.203 --> 09:31.238
She skates every time.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.306
We need to put a case
on her ass now.

09:33.306 --> 09:35.843
I'll do my best.

09:40.113 --> 09:41.915
Where's Janilla?

09:41.915 --> 09:44.584
She's, uh, working out
with the Explorers.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.020
This long?

09:47.020 --> 09:49.657
I'll check downstairs.
I'll try
the parking lot.

09:55.863 --> 09:58.999
(door alarm dinging,
indistinct radio transmission)

10:02.035 --> 10:06.306
All right, now, remember,
observe and evaluate the area.

10:06.306 --> 10:09.242
The footprints...

10:09.242 --> 10:11.178
the tire prints.

10:20.087 --> 10:21.689
(flies buzzing)

10:23.423 --> 10:27.260
(chuckles):
Well, I don't think somebody
lost their luggage.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.401
(flies buzzing)

10:34.401 --> 10:36.303
All right, thank you.
All right, hospital said

10:36.303 --> 10:38.605
Janilla hasn't been in to see
her grandma since yesterday.

10:38.605 --> 10:41.041
Told the watch commander
if anyone sees her,
call us immediately.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.843
What's her
boyfriend's name?

10:42.843 --> 10:44.712
Janilla's boyfriend,
the one in Grape Street,

10:44.712 --> 10:46.013
what's his name?
Marquece. Marquece.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.480
But, uh, she broke up
with him, right?

10:47.480 --> 10:49.249
Yeah, but she's 15--
where else are you gonna go

10:49.249 --> 10:51.018
when you're 15, you're scared,
you're bored,

10:51.018 --> 10:52.352
ripped away from
everything you know?

10:52.352 --> 10:54.054
I'll check for
last known address.

10:54.054 --> 10:55.723
Well, Marta's been busy--
they just found the body

10:55.723 --> 10:57.858
of an Avenues banger in a
suitcase at Dodger Stadium.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.993
That's probably the
shooter who missed
Janilla at the courthouse.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.261
You need to call me,
Janilla, right now.

11:01.261 --> 11:02.796
Sammy, text her;
she'll read it.

11:02.796 --> 11:04.231
He got pulled over
for a speeding ticket.

11:04.231 --> 11:05.933
Got his last
known right here.

11:05.933 --> 11:08.702
All right, we're gonna meet Sal
at Dodger Stadium.

11:13.907 --> 11:16.877
Jesus Malverde.

11:16.877 --> 11:17.978
The "narcosaint."

11:17.978 --> 11:19.012
You know, from Sinaloa.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.680
Patron saint
for drug dealers.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.615
Looks like a bad actor in one
of those cheesy Mexican films,

11:22.615 --> 11:24.051
you know?
Matinee idol.

11:24.051 --> 11:25.485
Shouldn't even be
sharing the name Jesus.

11:25.485 --> 11:27.220
It's freaking sacrilege.
(cell phone rings)

11:29.456 --> 11:32.692
Hey. How are you?

11:32.692 --> 11:36.029
Yeah. Me, too.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.465
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I'll be there.

11:38.465 --> 11:40.801
All right. Bye.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.805
DEWEY:
There's got to be a bathroom
around here somewhere, right?

11:44.805 --> 11:46.473
God, I got to take a leak.

11:46.473 --> 11:47.775
Hey, uh...

11:47.775 --> 11:49.076
Is there a bathroom
up here somewhere?

11:49.076 --> 11:54.014
¿Donde esta la baño?

11:54.014 --> 11:55.382
(engine starting)

11:55.382 --> 11:56.516
(laughing)

11:56.516 --> 11:57.918
Really? Is that funny?

11:57.918 --> 12:01.254
I'm going to go take a leak
on second base.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.090
DEWEY:
All right, I'm
rolling with you, man.

12:05.793 --> 12:07.761
You guys cover me here.

12:07.761 --> 12:08.962
He smells like booze.

12:08.962 --> 12:11.131
You notice that?

12:14.935 --> 12:17.370
I've had it.
I'm not doing this anymore.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.873
Boot.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.214
Bottom line?

12:27.214 --> 12:28.949
I'll cover for you as long
as it doesn't cost me my job

12:28.949 --> 12:30.617
or land me in jail.

12:30.617 --> 12:33.620
I think we're there.

12:33.620 --> 12:36.589
He should have retired.

12:36.589 --> 12:37.925
Turn him in.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.862
You do it or I'll do it.

12:54.541 --> 12:55.843
(tires squealing)

12:59.146 --> 13:00.680
Stop!

13:00.680 --> 13:03.650
Put your hands behind your back.

13:03.650 --> 13:05.118
Why you running, huh?

13:05.118 --> 13:06.786
Why you running?
You carrying?

13:06.786 --> 13:08.655
No, man.
Y'all swooping in like that,

13:08.655 --> 13:09.923
makes me agitated, for real.

13:12.259 --> 13:14.327
You got to stop
Crippin', Rashad.

13:14.327 --> 13:16.063
You sit on that curb
up there. Come on.

13:16.063 --> 13:18.631
I'm just running from
the injunction, that's all.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.567
(panting)

13:21.768 --> 13:23.403
Let's go, Janilla.

13:23.403 --> 13:24.637
But, I just...

13:24.637 --> 13:26.874
Janilla!

13:53.033 --> 13:54.467
What the hell
were you thinking?

13:54.467 --> 13:57.437
You gonna do that
half-marathon?

13:57.437 --> 13:59.206
I'm thinking of
doing Baker to Vegas.

13:59.206 --> 14:01.274
(phone rings)
Hey!

14:01.274 --> 14:05.678
Wow!

14:05.678 --> 14:07.014
Hello?

14:07.014 --> 14:09.716
Hey, Lydia.
Remember I talked to you

14:09.716 --> 14:11.684
about our gang witness, Janilla?

14:11.684 --> 14:14.287
LYDIA:
Uh-huh. I remember.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.189
We really need your help.

14:16.189 --> 14:17.024
Now?

14:17.024 --> 14:18.491
This weekend?

14:18.491 --> 14:22.129
I was planning on going
to a barbecue with friends.

14:22.129 --> 14:24.031
So, bring her.

14:24.031 --> 14:27.334
Look, I wouldn't ask you
unless I really had to.

14:27.334 --> 14:28.635
All right.

14:28.635 --> 14:30.037
All right. That's fine.

14:30.037 --> 14:31.604
We can bring her now?

14:31.604 --> 14:35.976
Sure. How long do you think
she's going to stay?

14:35.976 --> 14:38.711
Couple days, tops.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.613
I can't put her in the system.

14:40.613 --> 14:41.949
So, what happened?

14:41.949 --> 14:43.883
He tell you
that he missed you, hmm?

14:43.883 --> 14:45.518
"Oh, Janilla,
I missed you so much."

14:45.518 --> 14:47.687
(giggling)
"I can't live without you."

14:47.687 --> 14:50.790
No.
(laughing)

14:50.790 --> 14:53.626
What, though?

14:53.626 --> 14:54.794
You felt lonely?

14:54.794 --> 14:56.429
You miss your grandma?

14:56.429 --> 14:58.365
Your friends?

14:58.365 --> 14:59.933
(car door opens)

14:59.933 --> 15:01.168
Okay.

15:01.168 --> 15:03.003
Look, I know
this isn't easy for you.

15:04.871 --> 15:07.074
It's all going
to be over soon.

15:07.074 --> 15:09.076
You're doing the right thing.
You know that, right?

15:10.677 --> 15:12.045
Yeah?

15:12.045 --> 15:14.347
Yeah.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.054
Where's Kimmy?

15:21.054 --> 15:23.856
SUSAN:
She already left with Chandler.
She's sleeping there.

15:23.856 --> 15:24.824
At a guy's house?

15:24.824 --> 15:26.793
It's a girl, Sal.

15:26.793 --> 15:31.064
What kind of name is Chandler?
You see what I'm talking about?

15:31.064 --> 15:32.799
The whole world
is going to hell.

15:32.799 --> 15:34.734
(sighs)

15:34.734 --> 15:37.104
I spoke to Dina about Russ.

15:37.104 --> 15:39.139
She really misses him, Sal.

15:39.139 --> 15:40.707
She didn't spell it out,

15:40.707 --> 15:42.742
but I think she'd be thrilled
if he came tonight.

15:42.742 --> 15:43.977
All right, listen.

15:43.977 --> 15:45.245
I'll call him, okay? Just...

15:45.245 --> 15:47.047
So, did you happen to get

15:47.047 --> 15:49.582
Chandler's folks' phone number
or anything?

15:49.582 --> 15:52.052
Sal, I can't check up on her
every minute.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.220
We have to trust her.

15:53.220 --> 15:56.956
No, you trust her.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.042
Why I got to go inside?

16:15.042 --> 16:17.177
Think we got curbside
service, homie?

16:17.177 --> 16:18.678
Ain't no drive-in, primo.

16:18.678 --> 16:20.680
Come on.

16:36.096 --> 16:38.798
Ya voy. Esta bien.

16:38.798 --> 16:40.700
(phone beeps off)

16:45.138 --> 16:47.807
Where's the girl at?

16:47.807 --> 16:49.442
I had her.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.211
Just like I told y'all I would.

16:51.211 --> 16:53.113
Where's she at now?

16:53.113 --> 16:55.215
Po-po came and got her.

17:04.491 --> 17:06.693
How much you make off me?

17:06.693 --> 17:07.927
We rock that shit up,

17:07.927 --> 17:09.596
and it sold itself.

17:09.596 --> 17:11.064
Now, I got a lot of respect
for y'all,

17:11.064 --> 17:13.100
selling us like y'all do.

17:13.100 --> 17:14.934
It don't usually
work that way.

17:14.934 --> 17:17.770
That's right, pendejo.
And for that reason,

17:17.770 --> 17:21.808
plus the money you still owe
me, you get me that girl.

17:21.808 --> 17:24.477
I got no problem with that,
all right?

17:24.477 --> 17:26.946
I'm tired of
that bitch anyway.

17:26.946 --> 17:28.781
I don't like no kind of snitch.

17:28.781 --> 17:31.118
Hold on! Hold on!

17:31.118 --> 17:32.252
Easy, cuz!

17:32.252 --> 17:33.720
I want to show y'all something.

17:37.090 --> 17:40.427
"Trust no bitch."

17:44.731 --> 17:47.834
I'm a bitch,

17:47.834 --> 17:50.069
and you trust me.

17:51.838 --> 17:56.676
You'd better find that girl
and make sure she stays there.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.845
No more games.

17:58.845 --> 18:01.214
I can do that.

18:01.214 --> 18:03.049
She already texted me.

18:03.049 --> 18:04.717
They're moving her.

18:04.717 --> 18:07.854
Just give me a little time.
Let me settle in.

18:07.854 --> 18:11.291
And I'll let you know
when you got your window.

18:11.291 --> 18:16.296
You fuck up again,
your whole family's in trouble.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.331
Everybody goes.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.412
That's him.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.381
Camilo "Chuco" Salazar.
"Maria's child."

18:34.381 --> 18:38.651
We have to go tell Maria
her little buster's dead?

18:38.651 --> 18:40.052
Yep, we do.

18:40.052 --> 18:42.088
Well, they can "funeralize" him.

18:42.088 --> 18:43.356
Hey.

18:43.356 --> 18:47.527
What is "sexting"?

18:49.262 --> 18:50.597
Is that what I think it is?

18:52.199 --> 18:55.335
Yes. It's what
it sounds like.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.206
I'm going to kill her.

18:59.206 --> 19:02.542
I'm going to freaking kill her.

19:02.542 --> 19:03.843
What are you doing
this weekend?

19:03.843 --> 19:07.214
I am building
a decorative retaining wall

19:07.214 --> 19:09.349
around my agave garden.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.286
Nice.

19:13.286 --> 19:18.258
DISPATCH:
6 Adam 43. A woman is screaming
at 2245 Van Ness.

19:18.258 --> 19:22.395
Code 2, incident 1349, RD671.

19:22.395 --> 19:26.065
Could they be any more vague?

19:26.065 --> 19:28.468
I also got cactus, too.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.373
WOMAN:
And they will take care of this.

19:33.373 --> 19:36.108
You know I am right
and you are wrong.

19:36.108 --> 19:37.444
You should have it!
What's going on?

19:37.444 --> 19:40.179
Every day for 15 years!

19:40.179 --> 19:42.582
Ma'am, what's the problem?
They're out of chicken nuggets!

19:42.582 --> 19:44.984
I've eaten them every day
for 15 years!

19:44.984 --> 19:47.320
And you called 911 because
they're out of chicken nuggets?

19:47.320 --> 19:48.788
What am I supposed to do?

19:48.788 --> 19:50.423
I don't know what
you're supposed to do,

19:50.423 --> 19:52.392
but right now, you
need to bring it down!

19:52.392 --> 19:54.327
No, I won't!
Yes, you will!

19:54.327 --> 19:57.730
DISPATCH:
6 Adam 43, switch to channel 37
for the watch commander.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.999
It's a private channel,
must be important.

19:59.999 --> 20:01.234
6 Adam 43, Roger.

20:01.234 --> 20:02.435
Ma'am?

20:02.435 --> 20:04.637
Have you tried
the fish sandwich?

20:04.637 --> 20:05.705
What?

20:05.705 --> 20:07.774
The fish.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.376
It's pretty good.

20:21.988 --> 20:23.923
(car engine starting)

20:33.165 --> 20:35.768
WATCH COMMANDER (over radio):
We have a witness staying
with one of our detectives

20:35.768 --> 20:37.604
at her home,
which is in your area.

20:37.604 --> 20:40.407
We're putting together
a security detail.

20:40.407 --> 20:41.641
Roger that.

20:41.641 --> 20:43.510
Work it out
with the other units,

20:43.510 --> 20:46.212
but we want the house covered
around the clock.

20:46.212 --> 20:47.914
Will do, sir.

20:47.914 --> 20:50.182
Looks like you might be missing
your girlfriend's concert.

20:50.182 --> 20:51.418
Yeah. I got that.

20:51.418 --> 20:54.954
Yeah, well, we'll
see how it goes,

20:54.954 --> 20:57.557
who else is working.

20:58.658 --> 21:00.627
Thanks.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.398
Well, are you hungry?

21:05.398 --> 21:07.266
Not really.

21:07.266 --> 21:10.803
We're invited
to a barbecue later.

21:13.440 --> 21:17.310
Is there anything I can get you,
anything you may need?

21:17.310 --> 21:20.112
No.

21:20.112 --> 21:23.350
Come on, Janilla, help me out.

21:23.350 --> 21:25.017
I know this isn't easy,

21:25.017 --> 21:27.854
but at least let's try
to make the best of it.

21:29.556 --> 21:32.191
We can have our own barbecue,

21:32.191 --> 21:35.294
I can run to the store
and grab some burgers,

21:35.294 --> 21:37.263
throw them
on the grill.

21:37.263 --> 21:41.601
Rent some movies?

21:41.601 --> 21:42.969
Okay.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.137
Cool.

21:45.137 --> 21:47.407
Are kids still saying "cool"?

21:57.384 --> 21:59.519
So you're building this wall
by yourself?

21:59.519 --> 22:01.220
(chuckles)

22:01.220 --> 22:02.755
You nuts?

22:02.755 --> 22:04.391
Got a friend
working with me.

22:04.391 --> 22:06.192
(car engine starts in distance)

22:06.192 --> 22:08.428
Caesar.

22:08.428 --> 22:10.597
That's good.

22:10.597 --> 22:12.799
What kind of concert
she doing tonight?

22:12.799 --> 22:14.934
Ah, it's a club
in Silverlake.

22:14.934 --> 22:17.003
She played me a CD;
she's-she's good.

22:17.003 --> 22:19.372
What kind of stuff?

22:19.372 --> 22:21.073
I don't know how
to describe it.

22:21.073 --> 22:22.975
Um...

22:22.975 --> 22:24.010
K.D. Lang meets

22:24.010 --> 22:26.012
Joni Mitchell.

22:28.080 --> 22:29.549
Cool.

22:31.484 --> 22:33.453
I got to take a leak.

22:33.453 --> 22:34.787
Again?

22:34.787 --> 22:37.123
Yeah. What are you,
my mother?

22:37.123 --> 22:40.059
(car door alarm dinging)

22:49.201 --> 22:50.470
What's going on in here?

22:50.470 --> 22:52.605
Nobody move.

22:59.546 --> 23:00.780
Six A 37,

23:00.780 --> 23:03.416
is Six L 20
available for a meet?

23:03.416 --> 23:05.418
WOMAN:
Copy that. Stand by.

23:07.286 --> 23:10.289
(cell phone ringing)

23:10.289 --> 23:11.424
Where the hell have you been?

23:11.424 --> 23:12.425
W-Whoa, whoa!

23:12.425 --> 23:13.626
What are you so upset about?

23:13.626 --> 23:15.061
Are you joking?

23:15.061 --> 23:17.497
I had to hand Janilla over
to another detective

23:17.497 --> 23:21.033
because you couldn't be
bothered to watch her.

23:21.033 --> 23:23.670
On a holiday, no less.

23:23.670 --> 23:26.506
How do you think
that made her feel?

23:26.506 --> 23:28.475
I was gonna see
if you wanted to meet me

23:28.475 --> 23:30.176
for an early dinner
at Church & State,

23:30.176 --> 23:32.244
but I think I just changed
my mind, Sammy!

23:32.244 --> 23:34.280
(sighs)

23:34.280 --> 23:35.347
I'm sorry.

23:35.347 --> 23:37.016
Uh, I'm just worried about her.

23:37.016 --> 23:38.084
It's not your fault.

23:42.789 --> 23:44.824
Damn it!

23:44.824 --> 23:47.827
She's going to a rave!

23:47.827 --> 23:49.529
You know how dangerous
those things are?

23:49.529 --> 23:51.898
They actually have
ambulances waiting there

23:51.898 --> 23:53.432
to handle all
the overdoses.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.067
I'll go with you.
Me, too.

24:08.581 --> 24:09.782
Yo!
Hey!

24:11.651 --> 24:12.652
ID, please.

24:12.652 --> 24:13.986
I ain't got no ID.

24:13.986 --> 24:15.287
Um, he's my
boyfriend.

24:15.287 --> 24:16.355
It's okay.

24:16.355 --> 24:18.290
Uh, not really,
sweetheart.

24:18.290 --> 24:19.291
I live here.

24:19.291 --> 24:20.627
It's fine.

24:20.627 --> 24:22.028
Call the station,
tell them what we've got.

24:22.028 --> 24:23.563
Put your hands
in front of you, please.

24:23.563 --> 24:24.831
Six Adam 43,
request L 90...

24:24.831 --> 24:26.465
Why don't you guys
come sit on the porch.

24:26.465 --> 24:27.934
...switch to TAC
frequency.

24:27.934 --> 24:29.569
WOMAN:
Copy that, Six A 43.

24:32.605 --> 24:33.773
(beep)

24:42.314 --> 24:45.417
(groaning)

24:45.417 --> 24:47.587
God, I was out
for a minute.

24:47.587 --> 24:49.155
Want to go get
something to eat?

24:49.155 --> 24:50.422
No.
Huh?

24:50.422 --> 24:53.425
We're gonna wait here
for a little bit.

24:53.425 --> 24:54.493
What, you
turning me in?

24:54.493 --> 24:55.562
You're damn right I am!

24:55.562 --> 24:56.729
You could do that to me?

24:56.729 --> 24:58.765
I told you
again and again, Dewey,

24:58.765 --> 25:02.334
you've been acting like
a shit cop.

25:02.334 --> 25:05.204
Sergeant's meeting us here.

25:07.907 --> 25:09.508
You ain't
turning me in.

25:09.508 --> 25:10.643
(engine starts)

25:10.643 --> 25:11.744
You ain't
turning me in.

25:11.744 --> 25:14.480
(tires screech)

25:14.480 --> 25:16.616
Dewey, stop
the damn car!

25:20.486 --> 25:23.455
Stop this fucking car
right now!

25:23.455 --> 25:26.759
All right, I can
take it from here.

25:26.759 --> 25:30.329
Look, you're gonna
have to leave.

25:30.329 --> 25:31.831
It's not personal,

25:31.831 --> 25:35.034
but if you care anything about
her, this is for her safety.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.669
So you're gonna
have to go.

25:38.537 --> 25:41.540
Right now.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.676
(sighs)

25:55.588 --> 25:57.523
Look, I'm sorry, Janilla.

25:57.523 --> 25:59.058
But this is for your safety,

25:59.058 --> 26:01.661
and that has to be
my number one concern.

26:01.661 --> 26:02.662
Okay?

26:02.662 --> 26:04.563
Okay.

26:08.434 --> 26:09.435
Okay.

26:09.435 --> 26:10.502
(all chuckle)

26:10.502 --> 26:11.570
(door closes)

26:11.570 --> 26:12.739
We're here
if you need us.

26:12.739 --> 26:14.406
Thanks, guys.

26:14.406 --> 26:16.843
Dewey, stop the damn car!

26:16.843 --> 26:19.578
What the hell
are you doing?! Fuck!

26:27.286 --> 26:28.921
Dewey, cut it out!

26:30.422 --> 26:31.858
Dewey, stop!

26:31.858 --> 26:34.126
You're being like
a fucking kid!

26:34.126 --> 26:35.494
(tires screech)

26:35.494 --> 26:36.796
You ain't turning me in.

26:44.236 --> 26:45.204
(grunting)

26:47.907 --> 26:49.642
Stop the car right now!

27:00.119 --> 27:01.353
What the hell?!

27:03.823 --> 27:04.991
Don't do this!

27:20.873 --> 27:22.174
Listen to me!

27:22.174 --> 27:24.310
Stop this car
right this minute!

27:31.517 --> 27:32.952
The hell are
you doing?!

27:51.704 --> 27:52.939
(radio static crackles)

27:52.939 --> 27:54.506
CHICKIE:
Officers need help!

27:54.506 --> 27:56.042
(spits)

27:56.042 --> 27:56.909
(coughing)

27:56.909 --> 27:58.510
We have been in a T.C.!

27:58.510 --> 28:00.246
Car is inside the L.A. River,

28:00.246 --> 28:02.581
just north of
the 1st Street Bridge!

28:02.581 --> 28:03.816
Requesting an ambulance!

28:03.816 --> 28:04.851
That sounds like Chickie.

28:04.851 --> 28:06.152
Inside the river?

28:06.152 --> 28:07.787
Must have gone off the
bridge or something.

28:07.787 --> 28:09.822
Call for backup.

28:09.822 --> 28:12.291
Request security backup
our location.

28:12.291 --> 28:13.793
DISPATCH:
...A 54, on our way.

28:13.793 --> 28:16.162
How far are you?

28:16.162 --> 28:17.363
30 seconds out.

28:17.363 --> 28:18.330
Copy.

28:20.632 --> 28:21.600
(indistinct radio chatter)

28:21.600 --> 28:22.769
(groans)

28:25.938 --> 28:28.440
He's going
to the farm.

28:28.440 --> 28:31.277
He can dry out.

28:31.277 --> 28:32.611
This sucks.

28:32.611 --> 28:33.880
Hey, he could've
killed you.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.181
Hey, he'll be fine.

28:35.181 --> 28:36.082
All right?

28:36.082 --> 28:38.217
He'll get the help
he needs.

28:58.938 --> 29:01.073
(engine idling)

29:19.258 --> 29:20.092
(sighs)

29:20.092 --> 29:22.428
Hi.

29:22.428 --> 29:24.897
I'm sorry.

29:24.897 --> 29:26.132
I-I should have asked.

29:31.337 --> 29:32.338
It's okay.

29:32.338 --> 29:33.339
(sobs)

29:33.339 --> 29:35.474
It's okay.

29:35.474 --> 29:36.843
I'm so sorry.

29:36.843 --> 29:38.978
Me, too.
Me, too.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.715
It's gonna be okay.

29:43.715 --> 29:44.750
Is it?

29:44.750 --> 29:45.985
(sniffles)

29:45.985 --> 29:48.654
(techno music playing,
kids chattering)

29:48.654 --> 29:49.856
"Rave all day
and night.

29:49.856 --> 29:51.057
DJs will play
till you go home."

29:51.057 --> 29:52.524
That's a nitrous
oxide tank.

29:52.524 --> 29:54.426
Don't worry, if she's here,
we'll find her.

29:54.426 --> 29:57.263
(cell phone ringing)

29:57.263 --> 29:58.931
(groans)

29:58.931 --> 30:00.132
Kimmy, where are you?

30:00.132 --> 30:03.936
Daddy, I called
to tell you I love you.

30:03.936 --> 30:05.071
And I love Mommy...

30:05.071 --> 30:06.105
Kimmy, Kimmy, listen to me.

30:06.105 --> 30:07.139
Where exactly are you?

30:07.139 --> 30:08.507
Are you at the rave?

30:08.507 --> 30:10.509
(laughs):
We left.
Kimmy, listen to me!

30:10.509 --> 30:11.978
I-I'm downtown, okay?

30:11.978 --> 30:13.012
I'm here to get you, sweetheart.

30:13.012 --> 30:14.480
Okay, I love you, Daddy.

30:14.480 --> 30:15.481
Bye.

30:15.481 --> 30:16.215
(laughs)

30:16.215 --> 30:17.884
Kimmy, don't hang up!

30:17.884 --> 30:19.685
Drink water.

30:19.685 --> 30:22.488
Kimmy? Kimmy?

30:24.356 --> 30:27.459
She's as high
as a kite.

30:27.459 --> 30:28.895
Be all right.

30:28.895 --> 30:29.896
It'll be all right.

30:29.896 --> 30:32.064
Those are really pretty.

30:32.064 --> 30:33.900
Yeah, my mom
grew them.

30:33.900 --> 30:35.601
And I'm trying
not to kill them.

30:35.601 --> 30:36.969
(chuckles)

30:36.969 --> 30:40.472
I don't exactly
have a green thumb.

30:40.472 --> 30:42.508
It's really quiet
out here.

30:42.508 --> 30:44.110
Yeah.

30:44.110 --> 30:46.745
You know, it's also
'cause it's a holiday.

30:46.745 --> 30:48.881
What is that about again?

30:48.881 --> 30:50.582
Memorial Day?
Mm-hmm.

30:50.582 --> 30:51.884
It's meant to honor

30:51.884 --> 30:54.987
those that died
fighting for our country.

30:56.355 --> 31:00.259
My granddaddy,
he died in Vietnam.

31:00.259 --> 31:00.960
Really?

31:00.960 --> 31:01.961
Mm-hmm.

31:01.961 --> 31:04.931
That counts.

31:04.931 --> 31:07.166
(chuckles)

31:11.904 --> 31:12.972
Yo, you better
send some help.

31:12.972 --> 31:14.306
An officer just got shot.

31:14.306 --> 31:16.142
I'm right here on San Fernando
by the park

31:16.142 --> 31:17.309
on Sun Valley Road.

31:17.309 --> 31:18.777
Hurry up; I think he's dying.

31:18.777 --> 31:19.946
He's over here
convulsing shit.

31:24.816 --> 31:26.885
(car alarm wailing in distance)

31:26.885 --> 31:29.721
WOMAN (over radio):
All units, citizen reports
officer down, needs help.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.890
Shots fired, San Fernando Road
near Sun Valley Park.

31:31.890 --> 31:34.026
(siren wailing)

31:38.597 --> 31:39.765
(door closes)

31:39.765 --> 31:42.935
Hey, boot, you want
me to call that girl?

31:42.935 --> 31:44.736
Can, uh, explain
why you're late.

31:44.736 --> 31:47.073
No thanks.

31:47.073 --> 31:48.174
I'll write
you a note.

31:48.174 --> 31:50.542
Have a good weekend.

31:50.542 --> 31:53.045
You, too.

31:53.045 --> 31:55.047
There's an officer
needs help call

31:55.047 --> 31:58.317
that went out in
North Hollywood.

31:58.317 --> 32:01.020
Just being paranoid, Sammy.

32:01.020 --> 32:02.654
Maybe.

32:04.556 --> 32:11.063
* Traveling around
sure gets me down and lonely *

32:11.063 --> 32:16.668
* Nothing else to do
but close my mind *

32:16.668 --> 32:23.775
* Sure hope the road
don't come to own me *

32:23.775 --> 32:31.183
* There's so many dreams
I've yet to find *

32:33.819 --> 32:37.856
* But you're so far away

32:37.856 --> 32:43.996
* Doesn't anybody stay
in one place anymore? *

32:43.996 --> 32:45.897
(TV playing in background)

32:45.897 --> 32:47.199
(Janilla chuckles)

32:47.199 --> 32:48.667
MAN (on TV):
Harry!

32:48.667 --> 32:51.703
(woman speaking indistinctly
on TV)

32:51.703 --> 32:54.873
MAN:
Harry! Harry!

32:54.873 --> 32:56.975
Your wife-- she's wrecking
the town looking for you.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.844
Come on, I got to get
you out of here!

32:58.844 --> 33:00.579
(giggling)

33:00.579 --> 33:03.549
HARRY:
If she sees me out there,
she's gonna kill me!

33:05.284 --> 33:07.419
(crickets chirping)

33:12.124 --> 33:14.160
Janilla, I'm going
to the kitchen

33:14.160 --> 33:16.228
to get something.
Do you want anything?

33:16.228 --> 33:18.164
Oh, no, I'm good.

33:21.900 --> 33:23.435
(Janilla laughing)

33:44.156 --> 33:45.557
MAN (on TV):
Harry! Harry!

34:08.080 --> 34:10.616
I think everything
is fine, okay?

34:10.616 --> 34:13.785
I just thought I saw something,
and I need to make sure.

34:13.785 --> 34:17.089
(static crackles)
One-King-54,
requesting assistance.

34:17.089 --> 34:18.990
1487 Magnolia.

34:18.990 --> 34:20.959
Possible men with guns.

34:20.959 --> 34:22.027
(loud crashing nearby)

34:22.027 --> 34:23.462
Come on.

34:23.462 --> 34:26.598
(whispering):
Okay, I want you
to get into the tub.

34:26.598 --> 34:28.967
Use this only
if you have to.
(whimpering)

34:28.967 --> 34:30.136
Take it.

34:33.872 --> 34:35.141
(rack shell into chamber)

34:36.942 --> 34:38.410
(panting)

34:56.295 --> 34:57.296
(rack shell into chamber)

34:57.296 --> 34:58.764
(shell casing clatter to floor)

35:08.640 --> 35:10.108
(shell casing clinks on floor)

35:12.611 --> 35:14.846
(siren wailing)
All units now,
all units.

35:14.846 --> 35:16.081
Come on, man, go.

35:16.081 --> 35:18.184
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Jeez.

35:18.184 --> 35:19.718
(closes door)

35:24.055 --> 35:26.158
(floorboard above creaking)

35:34.466 --> 35:37.569
You gonna shoot me puta?

35:38.937 --> 35:40.038
(gunshot)

35:40.038 --> 35:41.640
(shotgun cocking)

35:41.640 --> 35:44.976
It's okay, it's okay.
You're okay.

35:44.976 --> 35:46.945
Lock the door behind me.

35:46.945 --> 35:49.248
(gasping)

36:05.831 --> 36:08.967
(car engine starts,
rapid gunfire)

36:08.967 --> 36:10.035
(cocks gun)

36:10.035 --> 36:11.803
(engine revving)

36:14.506 --> 36:17.409
(glass shattering,
tires squealing)

36:22.581 --> 36:25.083
You get a good
look at them?

36:25.083 --> 36:26.252
Yeah.

36:26.252 --> 36:27.819
Got somewhere
to go tonight?

36:27.819 --> 36:30.689
I don't know--
call a friend.

36:30.689 --> 36:32.358
Is there something
you need me to do?

36:32.358 --> 36:35.861
Hey, you okay?

36:35.861 --> 36:38.464
I think so.

36:39.731 --> 36:42.133
Can I talk to you
for a moment?

36:42.133 --> 36:44.270
(sirens wailing)

36:46.071 --> 36:47.906
The U.S. Marshals
are on their way.

36:47.906 --> 36:50.041
She'll go into
witness protection tonight.

36:50.041 --> 36:52.578
Now you have
the money.

36:52.578 --> 36:55.247
That's the way
it is, Detective.

36:58.650 --> 37:00.319
Guys.

37:18.670 --> 37:21.172
Ben, I've been, I've been
trying to call you all day

37:21.172 --> 37:22.874
to-to talk about this.

37:22.874 --> 37:28.046
Then I realized,
we can't talk, like...

37:28.046 --> 37:30.416
(sighs)

37:32.418 --> 37:34.386
You know?
Yeah.

37:39.458 --> 37:42.528
I'm going back to New York
tomorrow.

37:45.063 --> 37:47.265
I'm sorry.
I just...

37:48.434 --> 37:50.669
I was seeing someone
there, and...

37:52.538 --> 37:55.674
I thought I was done,
I did,

37:55.674 --> 38:00.045
but, um, we've been talking
the past couple of weeks,

38:00.045 --> 38:04.450
and... I think we need
to give it another shot.

38:11.222 --> 38:12.991
You sure?

38:15.126 --> 38:18.296
Yeah, I am.

38:20.966 --> 38:25.170
That's not what
I expected, you know.

38:25.170 --> 38:29.441
Uh... yeah, yeah, I do.

38:29.441 --> 38:31.042
Come on, come on.

38:31.042 --> 38:33.044
I'm, I'm sorry.

38:39.685 --> 38:41.353
*

39:13.118 --> 39:15.587
*

39:37.342 --> 39:39.945
(crying):
I love you, Daddy.

39:41.613 --> 39:44.349
(angry shouting in distance)

39:44.349 --> 39:46.585
Susan said
he lost his job.

39:46.585 --> 39:48.286
Oh, really?
Mm-hmm.

39:48.286 --> 39:51.657
You know what, I'm going to
see if they want to come over

39:51.657 --> 39:52.958
and have a drink, you know?

39:52.958 --> 39:55.060
Make a little peace
for the night.

39:55.060 --> 39:56.762
See you later.

40:16.081 --> 40:18.817
(fireworks exploding)

40:19.985 --> 40:22.120
(fireworks whistling
and popping)

40:30.228 --> 40:32.163
(angry shouting inside house)

40:32.163 --> 40:33.465
(knocking)

40:51.850 --> 40:53.819
(sighs)

41:24.015 --> 41:27.052
(fireworks popping
and whistling)

41:43.501 --> 41:45.971
Hey, Larry, how you doing?

41:45.971 --> 41:47.405
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

41:47.405 --> 41:48.574
Don't, don't...!

41:50.041 --> 41:52.911
BRIDGET:
I told you we shouldn't
keep a gun in the house!

41:52.911 --> 41:54.512
What are you...
Put the fucking gun down!

41:54.512 --> 41:56.214
What the...?
(gunshot)

41:59.618 --> 42:01.720
(gunshot)

42:04.155 --> 42:11.730
(fireworks popping)
