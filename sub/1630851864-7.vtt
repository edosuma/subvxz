10:23.748 --> 10:25.750
in the Steps of Knowledge
when we come back.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.001
Stay tuned!

10:27.043 --> 10:28.711
[cheering]

10:33.758 --> 10:35.676
Welcome back to the
Legends of the Hidden Temple.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.136
How you all feeling?

10:37.178 --> 10:40.389
[cheering]

10:40.431 --> 10:42.183
Love it!

10:42.224 --> 10:45.478
Red Jaguars, you were the
first team across the moat.

10:45.519 --> 10:47.938
How are you feeling about
the Steps of Knowledge?

10:47.980 --> 10:50.149
-We feel incredible!
-Whoo!

10:50.191 --> 10:52.652
Diogo's going to use
his cat-like reflexes

10:52.693 --> 10:55.946
to hit the buzzer as soon as
Olmec finishes the question

10:55.988 --> 10:59.992
and then I'll use this
incredible voice to answer them.

11:00.034 --> 11:02.078
We saw how fast
you were crossing the moat,

11:02.119 --> 11:04.413
now let's see
how smart you are.

11:04.455 --> 11:06.832
Listen carefully
because Olmec will tell you

11:06.874 --> 11:10.586
the origins of the legend of
the Golden Apples of Atalanta.

11:10.628 --> 11:12.254
Olmec.

11:12.588 --> 11:17.134
After slaying the centaurs,
Atalanta's reputation grows.

11:17.176 --> 11:19.261
She is the first woman
invited

11:19.303 --> 11:22.056
to the Calydonian boar hunt

11:22.098 --> 11:26.185
in honor of Oeneous,
the King of Wine.

11:26.227 --> 11:29.605
Every single man refuses
to hunt with Atalanta,

11:29.647 --> 11:33.192
save the king's own son,
Meleager.

11:33.234 --> 11:37.321
With little fanfare,
Atalanta tracks the boar

11:37.363 --> 11:40.700
and shoots one single
arrow to draw first blood,

11:40.741 --> 11:44.704
wounding the boar and setting
Meleager up to finish it off.

11:44.745 --> 11:48.290
The king celebrates
the kill.

11:48.332 --> 11:50.167
"Huzzah! Huzzah!

11:50.209 --> 11:52.628
Meleager the boar slayer!

11:52.670 --> 11:57.341
My own son takes down
the beast and wins the skin."

11:57.383 --> 11:58.926
"No, Father.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.845
Atalanta
drew first blood.

12:00.886 --> 12:03.097
She deserves the trophy."

12:03.139 --> 12:06.976
To save face after
being beaten by a woman,

12:07.017 --> 12:10.312
the embarrassed hunters
insist that Meleager

12:10.354 --> 12:12.690
accept the giant boar skin,

12:12.732 --> 12:18.279
but he ignores them and
awards it to Atalanta instead.

12:18.320 --> 12:23.117
Outraged, the men conspired
to kill her and snatch it back.

12:23.159 --> 12:27.455
Hearing of the plot,
Meleager kills them all first.

12:27.496 --> 12:30.040
And Atalanta
goes on to the next test:

12:30.082 --> 12:33.127
defeating Peleus,
the Rock of his day,

12:33.169 --> 12:36.380
in an epic wrestling match.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.632
JENNIFER:
Much like Atalanta,

12:38.674 --> 12:40.468
I'm sure I've made
a lot of mistakes,

12:40.509 --> 12:43.012
but what she has done
for herself

12:43.053 --> 12:46.557
is just very rewarding to know

12:46.599 --> 12:50.394
that it's not what happens
to you,

12:50.436 --> 12:52.271
but it's how you choose
to come out of it

12:52.313 --> 12:54.190
and what you choose to make
for yourself.

12:54.899 --> 12:57.151
These are
the Steps of Knowledge.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.069
Olmec will be asking
you questions

12:59.111 --> 13:01.197
about the legend you just heard.

13:01.238 --> 13:05.284
He'll also ask general knowledge
questions related to the story.

13:05.326 --> 13:06.911
Once he is done asking
the question,

13:06.952 --> 13:09.288
stomp on the ancient mark
in front of you.

13:09.330 --> 13:11.957
If correct, you are able
to take a step down.

13:11.999 --> 13:13.709
If you are wrong, though,

13:13.751 --> 13:15.711
or take too long, the
other teams have a chance.

13:15.753 --> 13:17.588
The first two teams
to reach the bottom

13:17.630 --> 13:19.840
move forward
to the temple games.

13:19.882 --> 13:24.178
Unfortunately, that means
the last team will be out.

13:24.220 --> 13:25.888
Are you ready?

13:25.930 --> 13:28.641
Let me see you.
Yeah, your piece is good.

13:28.682 --> 13:30.434
Is mine actually good,
though?

13:30.476 --> 13:31.727
-Yeah.
-Fix any part you see.

13:31.769 --> 13:33.145
No, you're perfect.

13:33.187 --> 13:34.605
Now we're good.
Now we're ready.

13:34.647 --> 13:35.981
-Let's go!
-All right.

13:36.023 --> 13:37.691
Olmec,
first question, please.

13:39.276 --> 13:43.948
What is the name of the event
Atalanta is invited to?

13:43.989 --> 13:45.324
[ringing]

13:45.366 --> 13:46.867
Silver Snakes.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.118
The Calydonian Boar Hunt.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.620
That is correct.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.789
Wow, that is impressive.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.208
Please, take a step down.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.335

14:01.257 --> 14:02.967

14:03.008 --> 14:05.135

the first woman to compete.

14:05.177 --> 14:07.388

14:07.429 --> 14:08.848

CHRISTELA: Oh, Silver
Snakes showing us how it's done.

14:16.272 --> 14:17.481
Exciting.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.191
One more and we're there.

14:19.233 --> 14:20.609
We're going
to the temple games.

14:20.651 --> 14:22.111
CHRISTELA: Olmec.

14:22.152 --> 14:25.364
A centaur is
half what and half what?

14:25.406 --> 14:26.949
CHRISTELA: Red Jaguars.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.868
Half man, half horse.

14:28.909 --> 14:30.452
That is correct.

14:30.494 --> 14:31.954
CHRISTELA: Congratulations.

14:31.996 --> 14:33.789
You can take a step forward.

14:33.831 --> 14:36.041
Yes.
I love to see it.

14:36.083 --> 14:37.585
What?
That energy.

14:37.626 --> 14:40.296
We talked about how confident

14:40.337 --> 14:42.047

the Steps of Knowledge.

14:42.089 --> 14:43.549
This is our strongest event.

Nobody tells
you how anxious you are

14:46.594 --> 14:48.470

standing on the steps.

14:48.512 --> 14:50.639
CHRISTELA:
Olmec, next question.

14:50.681 --> 14:54.518
Hw many arrows did it
take to take down the boar?

14:54.560 --> 14:56.437
CHRISTELA: Silver Snakes.

14:56.478 --> 14:57.688

CHRISTELA: Take one step.

15:16.874 --> 15:19.835
Orange iguanas.
Red jaguars, neck to neck.

15:19.877 --> 15:21.462
People think
we're pretty boys.

15:21.503 --> 15:23.422
And that we're like, stupid
or not smart.

15:23.464 --> 15:26.175
But we got the looks
and we also got the brains.

15:26.216 --> 15:27.468
Yeah.

15:27.509 --> 15:29.303
Olmec.

15:29.345 --> 15:33.265
Which of these bodies
of water does Greece not border?

15:33.307 --> 15:38.812
Mediterranean Sea,
Aegean Sea, Black Sea--

15:38.854 --> 15:40.147
Ionian Sea.

15:40.189 --> 15:41.857

Oh, wow, Orange Iguana,

15:47.279 --> 15:48.906
take another step.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.407
Still, anyone's game,
though.

15:50.449 --> 15:51.700
Olmec?

15:51.742 --> 15:53.410
Which of
these celebrities

15:53.452 --> 15:55.704
famously has a child
named Apple?

15:55.746 --> 15:57.414
[ringing]

15:57.456 --> 15:58.832
CHRISTELA: Red Jaguars?

15:58.874 --> 16:00.209
Gwyneth Paltrow?

16:00.250 --> 16:02.544
-That is correct.
-This is intense!

16:02.586 --> 16:06.173
We got all three teams
neck-in-neck-in-neck

16:06.215 --> 16:08.759
to see who is going to move
forward to the temple games.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.427
Olmec, next question.

16:10.469 --> 16:13.722
Who was the top god
of the ancient Greeks?

16:13.764 --> 16:16.016
CHRISTELA: Red Jaguars?

16:16.058 --> 16:17.434
Zeus.

16:17.476 --> 16:19.979
That is correct.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.855
CHRISTELA: Oh,
come down to the final step.

16:21.897 --> 16:23.732
Red Jaguars will be
moving to the temple games.

16:23.774 --> 16:26.610
So, finishing first
in both events,

16:26.652 --> 16:28.862
most people might think
that it feels really good

16:28.904 --> 16:31.657
and it does because we finished
first and it was awesome.

16:31.699 --> 16:33.325
-It is awesome!
-We are rocking this.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.244
CHRISTELA: We still
have one more spot left.

16:35.285 --> 16:37.746
Will it be The Silver Snakes
or The Orange Iguanas?

16:37.788 --> 16:40.374
We are very worried.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.918
But I hope that
our focus and our calmness

16:42.960 --> 16:44.378
and everything will help.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.422
Olmec?

16:46.463 --> 16:51.010
The Caledonian hunt was in honor
of Oeneous, the king of what?

16:51.051 --> 16:52.678
CHRISTELA: Silver Snakes?

16:52.720 --> 16:55.347
-Wine.
-That is correct.

16:55.389 --> 16:56.890
[cheering]

17:00.561 --> 17:02.938

to the temple games.

Yes.

17:04.606 --> 17:06.734
Unfortunately,
Orange Iguanas,

17:06.775 --> 17:08.444
that means you are not
moving forward.

17:08.485 --> 17:10.320
I am so sorry.
You played a great game.

17:10.362 --> 17:12.114
You're not
going home empty-handed.

Drinks on me, okay?

41:20.561 --> 41:22.188
This is life changing.

41:22.229 --> 41:24.190
I'm gonna buy so much catnip.

41:24.231 --> 41:27.193
Red Jaguars, you did it!

41:27.234 --> 41:29.737
It's the power of the cat
that got us through the temple.

41:29.778 --> 41:31.780
We went
in with chaos and fury

41:31.822 --> 41:34.658
and then finished
with our wits and our senses.

41:34.700 --> 41:40.039
And...golden
apple equals $25,000.

41:40.080 --> 41:41.874
I think we could do that math.

41:41.916 --> 41:43.417
That's a lot...that's
a lot of apples.

41:43.459 --> 41:45.503
I'm Christela Alonzo.

41:45.544 --> 41:48.047
Join us next time for more
Legends of the Hidden Temple.

41:48.088 --> 41:49.924
Hey, Olmec,
you want to get out of here?

41:49.965 --> 41:51.717
Let's celebrate.

41:51.759 --> 41:54.637
I'm buying limestone margaritas
for everyone.

41:54.678 --> 41:59.934
[cheering]
