00:02.502 --> 00:03.461
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i> IS RECORDED

00:03.545 --> 00:05.505
IN FRONT
OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:15.348 --> 00:17.434
[turns on vacuum]

00:17.517 --> 00:18.393
[turns off vacuum]

00:18.476 --> 00:21.604
- JUST WANTED
TO MAKE SURE IT WAS WORKING.

00:21.688 --> 00:22.981
- IT'S WORKING.

00:23.064 --> 00:25.442
- GLAD SOMETHING IS.

00:25.525 --> 00:27.610
- I DON'T COME
TO YOUR PLACE OF BUSINESS

00:27.694 --> 00:29.279
AND BOTHER YOU.

00:29.362 --> 00:31.156
- YOU'RE OUR MAID.

00:31.239 --> 00:34.909
- I'M ON BREAK.

00:34.993 --> 00:37.120
WOW,
THAT IS SOME WATCH.

00:37.203 --> 00:38.913
ARE THOSE REAL DIAMONDS?

00:38.997 --> 00:40.290
- YES. THANK YOU.

00:40.373 --> 00:45.086
- MUST BE NICE.

00:45.170 --> 00:48.256
- MELANIE,
YOU HAVE GOT TO FIRE OUR MAID.

00:48.339 --> 00:49.632
- NO, I'M NOT GOING
TO FIRE JACKI.

00:49.716 --> 00:51.843
I'VE NEVER FIRED ANYONE.
YOU DO IT.

00:51.926 --> 00:55.138
- I CAN'T.
I'M A CELEBRITY.

00:55.221 --> 00:58.600
WE ALL SAW <i> THE HELP.</i>

00:58.683 --> 01:00.101
A CAUTIONARY TALE
THAT WHEN YOU FIRE MAIDS,

01:00.185 --> 01:03.313
THEY WRITE TELL-ALL BOOKS.

01:03.396 --> 01:06.733
- THAT'S THE MESSAGE
YOU GOT FROM THAT MOVIE?

01:06.816 --> 01:09.277
- WELL, THAT AND THE DEVASTATING
AND LASTING EFFECTS

01:09.360 --> 01:11.946
OF SOUTHERN HUMIDITY
ON YOUR HAIR.

01:12.030 --> 01:12.947
I KNOW.

01:13.031 --> 01:14.240
WE'LL GET JOY TO DO IT.

01:14.324 --> 01:15.658
- UH, NO.
WON'T WORK.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.410
JACKI SAYS SHE CAN'T
UNDERSTAND JOY'S ACCENT.

01:17.494 --> 01:18.369
ANYWAY,
WHO ARE WE GOING TO FIND

01:18.453 --> 01:19.829
TO REPLACE HER?

01:19.913 --> 01:21.998
- COULDN'T YOU JUST CLEAN UP
AFTER YOURSELVES?

01:22.081 --> 01:26.503
- ELKA, WE ARE NOT
IN THE MOOD FOR JOKES.

01:26.586 --> 01:27.837
ACTUALLY, YOU SHOULD
BE THE ONE TO FIRE HER.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.172
WHEN WE MOVED IN HERE,

01:29.255 --> 01:30.965
YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE
THE CARETAKER OF THE HOUSE.

01:31.049 --> 01:34.511
- HASN'T THAT SHIP SAILED?

01:34.594 --> 01:36.221
- SHH,
I THINK THE TV WENT OFF.

01:36.304 --> 01:39.891
SHE MIGHT BE COMING IN HERE.

01:39.974 --> 01:41.851
- OH, JACKI,
WHILE YOU'RE UP THERE,

01:41.935 --> 01:44.020
WOULD YOU MIND CHANGING
THE SHEETS ON MY BED?

01:44.103 --> 01:49.484
- I'M SORRY,
I DON'T SPEAK YOUR LANGUAGE.

01:50.985 --> 01:52.904
- ONE OF YOU HAS GOT
TO FIRE HER.

01:52.987 --> 01:54.489
- OH, JOY,
YOU LOOK SO PRETTY.

01:54.572 --> 01:55.532
- THANKS.

01:55.615 --> 01:58.827
RICK SPRINGFIELD IS
PICKING ME UP ANY MINUTE.

01:58.910 --> 02:01.412
- OH, HONEY,
IS IT REALLY RICK SPRINGFIELD

02:01.496 --> 02:03.206
OR JUST ANOTHER GUY THAT
YOU THINK

02:03.289 --> 02:04.707
LOOKS LIKE RICK SPRINGFIELD?

02:04.791 --> 02:06.376
- LIKE PUDGY RICK SPRINGFIELD,

02:06.459 --> 02:08.919
OR BLACK RICK SPRINGFIELD,

02:09.002 --> 02:10.255
OR PSYCHO RICK SPRINGFIELD

02:10.338 --> 02:12.423
WHO TRIED TO CHOKE YOU
IN YOUR SLEEP?

02:12.507 --> 02:14.217
- HE HAD NIGHT TERRORS.

02:14.300 --> 02:18.471
- WAKING UP NEXT TO YOU.

02:21.266 --> 02:23.351
- LOOK, IT REALLY IS HIM.

02:23.434 --> 02:25.061
I WAS DOWNTOWN SHOPPING,
AND I SAW SOMEONE

02:25.144 --> 02:26.604
WHO LOOKED
LIKE RICK SPRINGFIELD,

02:26.688 --> 02:29.816
SO I CHASED HIM
FOR A FEW BLOCKS, AS ONE DOES.

02:29.899 --> 02:31.067
- YEAH, WE REMEMBER.

02:31.150 --> 02:34.028
THAT'S HOW YOU MET RASTA
RICK SPRINGFIELD.

02:34.112 --> 02:36.197
- BUT THIS TIME
IT REALLY IS HIM.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.615
HE'S ONLY IN TOWN
FOR ONE NIGHT.

02:37.699 --> 02:39.909
SOME ROCK AND ROLL HALL
OF FAME THING.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.244
OH, THIS DATE HAS
TO GO PERFECTLY

02:41.327 --> 02:43.705
SO I CAN LIVE OUT
MY HIGH SCHOOL FANTASY.

02:43.788 --> 02:48.251
- NOT GRADUATING
IN A MATERNITY DRESS?

02:48.334 --> 02:49.252
- NO.

02:49.335 --> 02:50.920
TO SLEEP WITH RICK SPRINGFIELD,

02:51.004 --> 02:52.338
WHICH I PLAN ON DOING TONIGHT.

02:52.422 --> 02:54.632
AND I DON'T CARE
HOW SLEAZY THAT SOUNDS.

02:54.716 --> 02:55.633
[doorbell rings]

02:55.717 --> 02:57.135
OH, MY GOD,
THAT'S HIM.

02:57.218 --> 03:01.431
PREPARED
TO BE SHOCKED AND AWED.

03:01.514 --> 03:04.601
- HI, EVERYBODY.

03:04.684 --> 03:08.354
- WELL, SHE'S CLOSER
THAN CHINESE RICK SPRINGFIELD.

03:18.656 --> 03:21.993
{\an8}- GIRLS, YOU REMEMBER
MY FRIEND, MAMIE SUE.

03:22.076 --> 03:23.411
{\an8}- YES, HI.

03:23.494 --> 03:24.454
{\an8}SO ELKA TELLS US
THAT YOU TWO ARE WRITING

03:24.537 --> 03:26.623
{\an8}A RADIO PLAY TOGETHER AGAIN
FOR THE SENIOR CENTER?

03:26.706 --> 03:30.460
{\an8}- YES, THIS YEAR WE'RE ADAPTING
<i>GONE WITH THE WIND.</i>

03:30.543 --> 03:33.129
{\an8}I KNOW RADIO PLAYS
ARE A LITTLE OLD-FASHIONED,

03:33.212 --> 03:36.799
{\an8}BUT WE HAVE SO MUCH FUN
WRITING THEM.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.801
{\an8}- WE SURE DO.

03:38.885 --> 03:44.307
{\an8}- ALTHOUGH THE PAGES YOU WROTE
LAST NIGHT WERE TOTAL CRAP.

03:46.225 --> 03:47.477
{\an8}- WELL,
YOURS WERE SO BAD,

03:47.560 --> 03:50.146
{\an8}I'M USING THEM
AS PLACEMATS UNDER OUR TEA.

03:50.229 --> 03:52.273
{\an8}- OH, YOU MADE TEA.

03:52.357 --> 03:54.734
{\an8}- YES.
COME ON.

03:54.817 --> 03:56.444
{\an8}[doorbell rings]

03:56.527 --> 03:58.488
{\an8}- NOW THAT'S GOT TO BE HIM.

03:58.571 --> 04:02.992
{\an8}PREPARE TO BE SHOCKED AND AWED.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.161
{\an8}- HEY, JOY.
- HEY.

04:05.244 --> 04:07.121
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD.
YOU'RE RICK SPRINGFIELD.

04:07.205 --> 04:08.873
{\an8}- YEAH, DIDN'T
SHE TELL YOU I WAS COMING?

04:08.957 --> 04:11.042
{\an8}- YEAH, BUT JOY HAS MET
WITH SO MANY GUYS WHO LOOK--

04:11.125 --> 04:14.796
{\an8}- THESE ARE MY FRIENDS,
MELANIE AND VICTORIA.

04:14.879 --> 04:16.339
{\an8}- HI, RICK.
- HELLO.

04:16.422 --> 04:17.548
{\an8}- LOVED YOUR WORK ON
<i>GENERAL HOSPITAL.</i>

04:17.632 --> 04:19.007
{\an8}- OH,
THANKS A LOT.

04:19.091 --> 04:21.052
{\an8}HEY, IS THERE
A REST ROOM I CAN USE?

04:21.135 --> 04:22.345
{\an8}- DOWN THE HALL TO THE LEFT.

04:22.428 --> 04:24.597
{\an8}- OH, MELANIE,
THAT ONE'S BROKEN.

04:24.681 --> 04:27.058
{\an8}UH, USE THE ONE IN MY BEDROOM,
RIGHT AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS.

04:27.141 --> 04:28.685
{\an8}- THANKS.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

04:28.768 --> 04:31.479
{\an8}- YES, NICE TO MEET YOU.
- YEAH.

04:31.562 --> 04:32.563
{\an8}- THAT'S SO EXCITING.

04:32.647 --> 04:35.358
{\an8}RICK SPRINGFIELD IS GOING INTO
YOUR BEDROOM RIGHT NOW.

04:35.441 --> 04:37.986
{\an8}- I KNOW.
BRILLIANT, RIGHT?

04:38.069 --> 04:39.821
{\an8}I MEAN, LET'S FACE IT.

04:39.904 --> 04:41.155
{\an8}LOOK HOW NERVOUS I AM.

04:41.239 --> 04:42.365
{\an8}I WOULD HAVE MADE
A COMPLETE FOOL

04:42.448 --> 04:44.325
{\an8}OF MYSELF AT DINNER
AND RUINED EVERYTHING.

04:44.409 --> 04:45.868
{\an8}- SO, YOU'RE STILL GOING
TO SLEEP WITH HIM?

04:45.952 --> 04:47.370
{\an8}- WHY WOULDN'T I?

04:47.453 --> 04:49.247
{\an8}- WELL,
HE'S INCREDIBLY RUDE.

04:49.330 --> 04:51.082
{\an8}I MEAN,
WHEN I COMPLIMENTED HIS ACTING,

04:51.165 --> 04:53.543
{\an8}THAT WAS HIS CUE
TO COMPLIMENT MY ACTING.

04:53.626 --> 04:56.796
{\an8}IT'S JUST COMMON
CELEBRITY COURTESY.

04:56.879 --> 04:57.880
- WELL, I'LL GO UP THERE

04:57.964 --> 05:00.883
AND GIVE HIM
A GOOD TONGUE LASHING.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.093
[chuckling]

05:02.176 --> 05:03.928
[cell phone chimes]

05:04.012 --> 05:05.388
- OH, IT'S DONALD.

05:05.471 --> 05:06.889
HE'S APOLOGIZING
FOR RUNNING LATE.

05:06.973 --> 05:07.890
OR AS HE PUTS IT,

05:07.974 --> 05:10.059
[haughtily]
"BEING DILATORY."

05:10.143 --> 05:11.728
- I TAKE IT
FROM YOUR TONE OF VOICE

05:11.811 --> 05:14.230
YOU WILL NOT BE MISDIRECTING HIM
UP TO YOUR BEDROOM?

05:14.313 --> 05:16.065
- WELL,
AT FIRST I WAS FLATTERED

05:16.149 --> 05:18.568
THAT THIS BIG-TIME PROFESSOR
FOUND ME INTERESTING.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.737
I MEAN, HE'S SO SMART.
HE KNOWS SO MANY THINGS.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.030
- SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

05:22.113 --> 05:23.239
- IT'S EXHAUSTING.

05:23.322 --> 05:24.407
I GOT TIRED
OF HEARING ABOUT

05:24.490 --> 05:28.077
WHAT THINGS ARE
VIS-A-VIS OTHER THINGS.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.912
IT JUST MAKES ME FEEL DUMB.

05:29.996 --> 05:33.041
AND NOT SEXY-DUMB,
WHICH I'M FINE WITH.

05:33.124 --> 05:34.709
- GET OUT!

05:34.792 --> 05:36.294
DON'T JUST BURST INTO MY ROOM
WITHOUT KNOCKING!

05:36.377 --> 05:38.963
- HEY,
IS THAT RICK SPRINGFIELD?

05:39.047 --> 05:41.924
MUST BE NICE.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.801
[door slamming]

05:43.885 --> 05:49.307
GLAD I DIDN'T WASTE
MY TIME CHANGING THOSE SHEETS.

05:51.350 --> 05:53.394
- AND THEN
WHEN SCARLETT'S FATHER

05:53.478 --> 05:55.438
GETS THROWN FROM HIS HORSE...

05:55.521 --> 05:56.397
[bottle crackling]

05:56.481 --> 05:59.108
SEE, THAT SOUNDS
JUST LIKE A NECK BREAKING.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.109
both: [laughing]

06:00.193 --> 06:02.737
- I HAVE AN IDEA, TOO.

06:02.820 --> 06:04.447
IT'LL HELP US APPEAL
TO OUR YOUNGER AUDIENCE.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.407
- IT WOULD BE GREAT TO SEE

06:06.491 --> 06:09.410
SOME 70-YEAR-OLD BUTTS
IN THE SEATS.

06:09.494 --> 06:10.411
WHAT IS IT?

06:10.495 --> 06:16.501
- ONE WORD: VAMPIRES.

06:18.836 --> 06:21.172
- THERE AREN'T ANY VAMPIRES
IN <i> GONE WITH THE WIND.</i>

06:21.255 --> 06:23.800
- BUT THERE COULD BE.

06:23.883 --> 06:25.301
VAMPIRES ARE ALL THE RAGE.

06:25.384 --> 06:30.181
- FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE
THINGS THAT SUCK.

06:30.264 --> 06:33.309
WHICH I DON'T,
INCLUDING YOUR IDEA.

06:33.392 --> 06:36.646
- THE OLD BIDDY WITH NO CREATIVE
VISION SAYS WHAT?

06:36.729 --> 06:38.314
- I'M CREATIVE!

06:38.397 --> 06:41.692
AT LEAST I DON'T WEAR
THE SAME TRACK SUIT EVERY DAY.

06:41.776 --> 06:43.569
- BETTER THAN
AN APPLIQUED SWEATER

06:43.653 --> 06:45.530
YOU CAN SEE FROM OUTER SPACE.

06:45.613 --> 06:47.156
[bell dings]

06:47.240 --> 06:48.825
OH, COOKIES ARE DONE.

06:48.908 --> 06:52.703
I DOUBLED THE RECIPE
SO YOU CAN TAKE SOME HOME.

06:52.787 --> 06:54.163
- OH, YOU SPOIL ME.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.873
[laughing]

06:55.957 --> 06:58.251
- GORGEOUS LEGS.
- HMM.

06:58.334 --> 06:59.502
THANK YOU.

06:59.585 --> 07:03.005
- NO, I WAS REFERRING
TO THE WINE.

07:03.089 --> 07:06.008
YOURS ARE QUITE COMELY.

07:06.092 --> 07:07.677
[inhales]

07:07.760 --> 07:10.763
MM, WHAT A NOSE.

07:14.934 --> 07:17.770
- ME OR THE WINE?

07:17.854 --> 07:22.483
- OH, MY AMUSING POPPET.

07:24.735 --> 07:26.028
- AH...

07:26.112 --> 07:28.030
THAT'S JUST
HOW I DREAMED OF IT.

07:28.114 --> 07:29.699
- WE ONLY MET THIS MORNING.

07:29.782 --> 07:35.454
- UH, I NAPPED EARLIER TODAY.

07:35.538 --> 07:36.789
OH...

07:36.873 --> 07:39.041
WHERE'S YOUR SCAR?

07:39.125 --> 07:40.751
- WHAT SCAR?

07:40.835 --> 07:43.254
- THE SCAR
FROM YOUR MOTORCYCLE ACCIDENT.

07:43.337 --> 07:45.840
1982,
I CRIED FOR A WHOLE WEEK.

07:45.923 --> 07:46.591
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

07:46.674 --> 07:49.093
- UH...OH.

07:49.177 --> 07:50.219
OH, WOW.
I GOTTA GO.

07:50.303 --> 07:54.390
CALL ME.
<i>867-5309.</i>

07:54.473 --> 07:56.559
- THAT'S TOMMY TUTONE.

07:56.642 --> 07:58.728
- NO,
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT WAS ME.

07:58.811 --> 08:02.899
RICK SPRINGFIELD.

08:02.982 --> 08:05.568
- WELL, I'M HEADING HOME.

08:05.651 --> 08:08.404
ALTHOUGH, IT DOESN'T
SEEM LIKE MUCH OF A HOME

08:08.487 --> 08:10.615
SINCE MY DEADBEAT HUSBAND
LEFT ME.

08:10.698 --> 08:13.367
- WELL, TAKE CARE.
SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

08:15.453 --> 08:17.079
- OH, UH,

08:17.163 --> 08:21.375
SOMEBODY ACCIDENTALLY BROKE
YOUR TROPHY WHILE DUSTING.

08:21.459 --> 08:25.421
- OH, MY GOD!
YOU BROKE MY DAYTIME EMMY?

08:25.504 --> 08:28.090
SIT DOWN, JULIE.

08:28.174 --> 08:29.759
- IT'S JACKI.

08:29.842 --> 08:33.386
- I SAID SIT DOWN!

08:33.471 --> 08:36.140
- YOU CAN'T PUT VAMPIRES
AND SOUTHERN BELLES TOGETHER.

08:36.224 --> 08:38.267
- IT'S CALLED A MASH-UP.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.102
EVERYONE IS DOING IT.

08:40.186 --> 08:40.977
- THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID

08:41.062 --> 08:43.898
WHEN YOU WANTED ME
TO GET A MICROWAVE.

08:43.981 --> 08:45.650
- GET A MICROWAVE.

08:45.733 --> 08:49.904
IT'S 2012!

08:49.987 --> 08:52.240
[bottle crackling]

08:55.826 --> 08:57.119
- HOW WELL THIS WINE

08:57.203 --> 08:59.622
EXPRESSES
THE TERROIR OF THE DORDOGNE.

08:59.705 --> 09:01.457
- OH, BROTHER.

09:01.540 --> 09:04.335
- DID YOU SAY SOMETHING?

09:04.418 --> 09:05.962
- LOOK, DONALD,
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF FUN.

09:06.045 --> 09:08.130
AND I DO APPRECIATE
THE READING LIST.

09:08.214 --> 09:11.425
UH, BUT I JUST DON'T THINK
WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE.

09:11.509 --> 09:14.929
- OH, DON'T PUT YOURSELF DOWN
LIKE THAT, MELANIE.

09:15.012 --> 09:17.348
- OKAY. WASN'T.

09:17.431 --> 09:20.768
I JUST DON'T THINK
THINGS ARE GOING TO WORK OUT

09:20.851 --> 09:21.519
BETWEEN YOU AND I.

09:21.602 --> 09:22.812
- YOU AND ME.

09:22.895 --> 09:24.313
- OH, MY GOD.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.815
I'M TRYING TO BREAK UP WITH YOU,

09:25.898 --> 09:27.024
AND YOU'RE CORRECTING
MY GRAMMAR.

09:27.108 --> 09:28.317
- WHAT?
YOU'D RATHER BE IGNORANT?

09:28.401 --> 09:31.195
- HMM,
I WOULD RATHER BE ALONE,

09:31.279 --> 09:33.072
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO?

09:33.155 --> 09:35.241
- GLADLY.

09:35.324 --> 09:37.952
AND TO PARAPHRASE CATULLUS--

09:38.035 --> 09:41.163
- [groans]
OH, GET OUT!

09:41.247 --> 09:43.833
- FOLKS,
NOTHING TO BE ALARMED ABOUT.

09:43.916 --> 09:45.209
THERE WAS AN ARMED ROBBERY
IN THE AREA,

09:45.293 --> 09:47.211
AND WE'RE IMPOSING
A MANDATORY LOCKDOWN

09:47.295 --> 09:53.009
UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.

09:53.092 --> 09:56.220
- BUT HE CAN GO, RIGHT?

09:56.304 --> 09:59.307
- WELL, YOU CAN'T FIRE ME
BECAUSE I QUIT!

09:59.390 --> 10:01.642
- I NEVER WANT
TO SEE YOU AGAIN!

10:01.726 --> 10:04.020
- THAT'S STILL
TOO SOON FOR ME!

10:04.103 --> 10:08.316
- GET OUT OF MY SIGHT,
YOU FAKE RICK SPRINGFIELD!

10:08.399 --> 10:09.900
- OUT OF MY WAY--
- NO, YOU CAN'T LEAVE.

10:09.984 --> 10:11.402
THERE'S A MANHUNT GOING ON.

10:11.485 --> 10:12.987
THE POLICE HAVE ORDERED
EVERYBODY INSIDE,

10:13.070 --> 10:17.908
SO NOBODY CAN GO ANYWHERE.

10:20.286 --> 10:26.000
- WELL, THIS IS AWKWARD.

10:31.839 --> 10:33.174
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

10:33.257 --> 10:35.551
NOT ONLY DIDN'T I SLEEP
WITH RICK SPRINGFIELD,

10:35.634 --> 10:37.595
I DON'T EVEN KNOW THE NAME
OF THE GUY I DID SLEEP WITH.

10:37.678 --> 10:43.059
- NOT NOW, JOY.
SOME OF US HAVE NEW PROBLEMS.

10:44.477 --> 10:47.563
- FRANKLY,
I'M AFRAID FOR MY LIFE.

10:47.646 --> 10:49.106
- THE POLICE HAVE IT
UNDER CONTROL.

10:49.190 --> 10:50.691
- NOT FROM THE CRIMINAL.

10:50.775 --> 10:52.735
I'M SCARED OF JACKI.

10:52.818 --> 10:54.570
I FIRED ONE OF THE 99%,

10:54.653 --> 10:58.074
AND NOW SHE'S OCCUPYING
OUR LIVING ROOM.

10:58.157 --> 11:00.576
- I BET DONALD'S OUR THERE
RIGHT NOW

11:00.659 --> 11:01.952
JUDGING US
FOR OUR LACK OF BOOKS.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.621
- WE HAVE BOOKS.

11:03.704 --> 11:05.748
- YEAH, BUT THEY'RE
COFFEE TABLE BOOKS.

11:05.831 --> 11:08.542
THEY'RE NOT FOOLING ANYONE.

11:08.626 --> 11:11.212
- WE COULD BE STUCK HERE
FOR HOURS OR DAYS.

11:11.295 --> 11:12.630
HOW ARE WE GOING TO KILL TIME

11:12.713 --> 11:13.964
WITHOUT EVERYBODY
KILLING EACH OTHER?

11:14.048 --> 11:15.883
- WE COULD PLAY CHARADES.

11:15.966 --> 11:18.219
- THIS ISN'T SOME DINNER PARTY
GONE FLAT.

11:18.302 --> 11:20.096
NO, IT'S EIGHT PEOPLE
TRAPPED IN A HOUSE

11:20.179 --> 11:21.639
WHO CAN'T STAND EACH OTHER.

11:21.722 --> 11:23.933
- OH, SO IT'S THANKSGIVING.

11:24.016 --> 11:26.060
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

11:26.143 --> 11:27.645
ALL RIGHT,
WE ARE FOUR INTELLIGENT WOMEN.

11:27.728 --> 11:28.687
NOW I'M SURE THAT WE CAN COME UP

11:28.771 --> 11:31.440
WITH SOMETHING A LITTLE
LESS LAME THAN CHARADES.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.901
- MOVIE?
- MOVIE?

11:33.984 --> 11:36.445
- TWO WORDS.
- TWO WORDS.

11:36.529 --> 11:37.530
- IS IT <i> THE LION KING?</i>

11:37.613 --> 11:40.282
- YES!

11:40.366 --> 11:44.078
- [mockingly]
IS IT <i> THE LION KING?</i>

11:44.161 --> 11:46.789
- IMITATION IS THE HIGHEST FORM
OF FLATTERY.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.958
- NOT IN THIS CASE.

11:49.041 --> 11:52.086
- ONE POINT FOR <i> THE LION KING.</i>

11:52.169 --> 11:57.007
- OR IN YOUR CASE,
<i>THE LYING KING.</i>

11:57.091 --> 11:59.969
- SOMEBODY TRANSLATE.

12:00.052 --> 12:01.804
- WELL,
SHE'S MAKING A PUN VIS-A-VIS

12:01.887 --> 12:04.557
THE CELEBRATED ANIMATED FEATURE,
<i>THE LION KING.</i>

12:04.640 --> 12:07.685
YOU KNOW,
A LOT OF PEOPLE REGARD PUNS

12:07.768 --> 12:08.978
AS A LOWER FORM OF HUMOR,

12:09.061 --> 12:10.479
BUT SHAKESPEARE WOULD SOMETIMES

12:10.563 --> 12:11.772
PUT AS MANY
AS THREE IN A SINGLE LINE,

12:11.856 --> 12:15.818
SO KUDOS TO YOU, JOY.

12:15.901 --> 12:18.988
- SHUT UP, POINDEXTER.

12:19.071 --> 12:21.157
OH, I DON'T KNOW THIS ONE.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.617
-<i> QUELLE SURPRISE.</i>

12:23.701 --> 12:24.702
MUST BE MINE.

12:24.785 --> 12:29.206
"I WROTE <i> THE ILIAD</i>
IN THE ORIGINAL GREEK."

12:29.290 --> 12:33.002
- READ THIS
IN THE ORIGINAL GREEK.

12:33.085 --> 12:36.005
- BRAVA, MELANIE.

12:36.088 --> 12:40.384
- I'M NOT CLEANING THAT UP.

12:40.468 --> 12:43.471
- HAVE YOU EVER
CLEANED ANYTHING UP?

12:43.554 --> 12:46.015
- [mockingly] OH, THE DUCHESS
OF STICK-UP-HER-BUTT

12:46.098 --> 12:50.019
DOESN'T LIKE THE WAY I CLEAN.

12:50.102 --> 12:51.228
- IF YOU CAN TALK LIKE THAT,

12:51.312 --> 12:53.439
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING.

12:53.522 --> 12:57.651
- ANYONE?

12:57.735 --> 12:59.153
- YOU'RE FUNNY.

12:59.236 --> 13:02.156
- SHUT UP,
FAKE RICK SPRINGFIELD.

13:02.239 --> 13:04.992
- LOOK,
MY NAME IS TOM FONTANA.

13:05.075 --> 13:07.828
- WHO'S RICK SPRINGFIELD?

13:07.912 --> 13:11.540
- YOU MEAN YOU'VE NEVER HEARD
OF RICK SPRINGFIELD?

13:11.624 --> 13:16.420
- SORRY, I'M NOT UP-TO-DATE,
RAPPIN' GRANNY.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.673
- SO YOU REALLY JUST GO AROUND

13:19.757 --> 13:21.342
PRETENDING
TO BE RICK SPRINGFIELD

13:21.425 --> 13:22.551
AND SEDUCING WOMEN?

13:22.635 --> 13:25.262
- YEAH.

13:25.346 --> 13:26.889
I MEAN,
WOMEN OF A CERTAIN AGE.

13:26.972 --> 13:29.183
- [gasps]

13:29.266 --> 13:31.769
- YOU DID NOT JUST SAY THAT.

13:31.852 --> 13:37.650
[overlapping arguing]

13:39.985 --> 13:41.195
- WHAT ARE
YOU GUYS SO UPSET ABOUT?

13:41.278 --> 13:42.321
[gunshot]

13:45.324 --> 13:50.496
- SO I GUESS THE GAME'S OVER?

13:54.667 --> 13:56.252
- SORRY ABOUT THAT, FOLKS.
THAT WAS JUST A MISFIRE.

13:56.335 --> 13:59.922
THE SUSPECT IS STILL AT LARGE,
SO PLEASE REMAIN INSIDE.

14:00.005 --> 14:01.423
- BEFORE YOU GO, JUST CURIOUS.

14:01.507 --> 14:05.094
WHAT IS THE MAXIMUM PENALTY
FOR DESTROYING AN EMMY?

14:05.177 --> 14:07.471
HOW MANY YEARS
IS SHE LOOKING AT?

14:07.555 --> 14:09.098
- ME?

14:09.181 --> 14:11.433
SHE HAS LIKE ABOUT A THOUSAND
UNPAID PARKING TICKETS.

14:11.517 --> 14:14.645
- THANK YOU SO MUCH, OFFICER.
WE WILL REMAIN VIGILANT.

14:14.728 --> 14:18.148
- LOOK, I AM SORRY
I BROKE YOUR STUPID EMMY.

14:18.232 --> 14:20.276
BUT IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

14:20.359 --> 14:23.946
I'VE BEEN A LITTLE DISTRACTED
SINCE MY HUSBAND LEFT.

14:24.029 --> 14:25.573
- I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE MARRIED.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.283
- SEE,
THIS IS THE THING WITH YOU.

14:27.366 --> 14:29.952
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT MY LIFE

14:30.035 --> 14:32.496
BECAUSE YOU DON'T THINK
I'M AS IMPORTANT AS YOU.

14:32.580 --> 14:35.624
- OH, THAT IS UTTERLY,
COMPLETELY...

14:35.708 --> 14:38.335
MAYBE TRUE.

14:38.419 --> 14:44.216
OH, MY GOD.
I'M THE BAD PERSON IN <i> THE HELP.</i>

14:45.718 --> 14:50.222
BUT IN FAIRNESS,
YOU ARE TERRIBLE AT YOUR JOB.

14:50.306 --> 14:52.099
- THAT'S TRUE.

14:52.182 --> 14:55.477
BUT MAYBE IT'S A WAY
TO KEEP A LITTLE DIGNITY

14:55.561 --> 14:57.313
AND NOT FEEL LIKE YOUR SLAVE.

14:57.396 --> 15:00.899
- OH, THAT'S WHY YOU PRETEND NOT
TO UNDERSTAND ME.

15:00.983 --> 15:04.445
- THEY COME TO OUR COUNTRY.
THEY TAKE OUR JOBS.

15:04.528 --> 15:09.199
THE LEAST THEY CAN DO
IS LEARN TO SPEAK THE LANGUAGE.

15:09.283 --> 15:11.994
- I'M SORRY, JACKI.

15:12.077 --> 15:13.996
I WILL TRY TO TREAT YOU
AS AN EQUAL.

15:14.079 --> 15:15.497
I'VE NEVER TREATED ANYONE
AS AN EQUAL,

15:15.581 --> 15:16.832
BUT I WILL TRY.

15:16.915 --> 15:18.334
- WELL, THANKS.

15:18.417 --> 15:23.505
I'M SORRY, TOO.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.341
- WELL?

15:25.424 --> 15:26.967
- WHAT?

15:27.051 --> 15:28.677
- WELL,
IN THE SPIRIT OF APOLOGIES

15:28.761 --> 15:29.845
THAT SEEM TO BE IN THE AIR,

15:29.928 --> 15:32.389
DON'T YOU OWE ME ONE?

15:32.473 --> 15:34.683
- OKAY.
OKAY, HERE'S THE DEAL.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.061
I'M A TOLLBOOTH COLLECTOR.

15:37.144 --> 15:38.187
WANT TO SLEEP WITH ME?

15:38.270 --> 15:41.732
- UH...
- YEAH, I DIDN'T THINK SO.

15:41.815 --> 15:44.693
IT'S NOT A JOB
THAT ATTRACTS WOMEN.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.403
EVERY NOW AND THEN,
A WOMAN WOULD TELL ME

15:46.487 --> 15:47.863
I KIND OF LOOK LIKE
RICK SPRINGFIELD.

15:47.946 --> 15:50.866
SO I GREW MY HAIR OUT
AND COPIED HIS LOOK

15:50.949 --> 15:53.869
AND WOMEN STARTED THROWING
THEMSELVES AT ME.

15:53.952 --> 15:54.995
- ISN'T THAT RATHER SHALLOW?

15:55.079 --> 15:56.413
- SAID THE WOMAN
WHO JUST WANTED

15:56.497 --> 15:58.874
TO SLEEP
WITH RICK SPRINGFIELD?

15:58.957 --> 16:01.168
- I JUST WANTED TO LIVE OUT
MY TEENAGE FANTASY.

16:01.251 --> 16:02.294
- ME, TOO.

16:02.378 --> 16:07.132
MY TEENAGE FANTASY IS
TO SLEEP WITH A LOT OF WOMEN.

16:07.216 --> 16:09.093
CAN WE LOOK AT THIS
AS A WIN-WIN?

16:09.176 --> 16:10.386
- I SUPPOSE.

16:10.469 --> 16:11.887
ALTHOUGH
IT'S NOT VERY FLATTERING

16:11.970 --> 16:13.514
THAT YOU'LL JUST SLEEP
WITH ANY WOMAN

16:13.597 --> 16:14.723
WHO COMES UP TO YOU
ON THE STREET.

16:14.807 --> 16:15.933
- NOT ANY WOMAN.

16:16.016 --> 16:18.227
I MEAN,
YOU'RE VERY ATTRACTIVE.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.229
HAS ANYONE EVER TOLD YOU
YOU LOOK LIKE KATE BECKINSALE?

16:20.312 --> 16:24.108
- YES!
ALL THE TIME!

16:24.191 --> 16:26.360
- YEAH.

16:26.443 --> 16:29.571
- ACTUALLY, MELANIE,
SPEAKING OF DOPPELGANGERS,

16:29.655 --> 16:33.283
FIRST TIME I SAW YOU
AT THE COFFEE SHOP,

16:33.367 --> 16:35.577
I REMEMBER BEING STRUCK
BY YOUR RESEMBLANCE

16:35.661 --> 16:38.539
TO TITIAN'S
<i>VENUS OF URBINO.</i>

16:38.622 --> 16:40.874
- WELL,
I'D BE LYING IF I SAID

16:40.958 --> 16:42.543
I WASN'T FLATTERED BY THAT.

16:42.626 --> 16:45.254
I'D ALSO BE LYING IF I SAID
I KNEW WHO THAT WAS.

16:45.337 --> 16:47.297
- A REALLY HOT ITALIAN CHICK.

16:47.381 --> 16:48.549
- OH, WELL, SEE,

16:48.632 --> 16:49.967
WHY CAN'T YOU TALK
LIKE THAT ALL THE TIME?

16:50.050 --> 16:53.053
- I GUESS IT'S A BIT
OF A DEFENSE MECHANISM

16:53.137 --> 16:54.596
TO COVER UP MY INSECURITY.

16:54.680 --> 16:59.560
- OH,
YOU GOT A LITTLE ONE, HUH?

16:59.643 --> 17:02.312
- GOOD ONE, JACKI.

17:02.396 --> 17:03.564
- ACTUALLY,
IF YOU MUST KNOW,

17:03.647 --> 17:06.775
I'M POSITIVELY EQUINE.

17:06.858 --> 17:09.611
I GUESS WHAT I AM IS JEALOUS.

17:09.694 --> 17:11.113
YOU'RE A PUBLISHED AUTHOR,

17:11.195 --> 17:13.531
AND I'M AN AUTHOR
WITH MANY REJECTION SLIPS.

17:13.615 --> 17:15.284
- ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT

17:15.367 --> 17:16.993
<i>200 THINGS EVERY WOMAN SHOULD</i>
<i>DO BEFORE SHE DIES?</i>

17:17.077 --> 17:18.829
I MEAN,
IT'S BASICALLY JUST A LIST.

17:18.912 --> 17:21.290
- ACTUALLY,
IT'S DELIGHTFULLY WELL-WRITTEN

17:21.373 --> 17:22.415
AND INSPIRING.

17:22.499 --> 17:23.625
- THANK YOU.

17:23.709 --> 17:24.960
EVEN THOUGH
I KNOW YOU'RE JUST QUOTING

17:25.042 --> 17:27.128
VICTORIA CHASE'S BLURB
ON THE BACK.

17:27.212 --> 17:28.422
- WELL,
IF YOU'RE GOING TO STEAL,

17:28.505 --> 17:30.758
STEAL FROM THE BEST.

17:30.841 --> 17:36.597
- THAT'S WHAT I ALWAYS SAY.

17:37.723 --> 17:41.101
- I'M JEALOUS, TOO.

17:41.185 --> 17:42.186
OF YOU.

17:42.269 --> 17:43.812
- WHY?

17:43.896 --> 17:46.190
- YOU AND I USED TO BE SO CLOSE.

17:46.273 --> 17:48.609
BUT EVER SINCE
THESE GIRLS MOVED IN,

17:48.692 --> 17:51.862
YOU'VE GOTTEN
ALL HIP AND MODERN.

17:51.945 --> 17:54.156
AND I'M AFRAID
I CAN'T KEEP UP WITH YOU.

17:54.239 --> 17:57.367
- MAMIE, THAT'S CRAZY.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.828
YOU'RE STILL MY BEST FRIEND.

17:59.912 --> 18:03.999
- OH, ELKA.
YOU BATTY OLD BROAD.

18:04.082 --> 18:08.962
- [laughs]
OH, MAMIE, YOU LOVABLE DITZ.

18:09.046 --> 18:09.963
[knocking on door]

18:10.047 --> 18:11.715
- I WILL GET IT, MY FRIEND.

18:11.799 --> 18:13.050
- "FRIEND" IS TOO FAR.

18:13.133 --> 18:15.803
- YEAH, I DIDN'T LIKE IT,
EITHER.

18:15.886 --> 18:17.387
OH, HI, OFFICER.
ANY NEWS?

18:17.471 --> 18:18.847
- THE SUSPECT IS IN CUSTODY.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.183
YOU'RE ALL FREE TO GO.
THANKS FOR YOUR COOPERATION.

18:21.266 --> 18:22.768
- WELL, THANK YOU.
YOU GUYS ARE GREAT.

18:22.851 --> 18:23.852
- YOU'RE WELCOME, MA'AM.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.020
I MEAN, MISS.

18:25.103 --> 18:28.315
- HEY, THEY GOT OUR LETTER.

18:28.398 --> 18:32.694
- WELL,
I GUESS THAT'S GOOD-BYE.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.363
- WELL, NO.

18:34.446 --> 18:36.323
YOU COULD STICK AROUND
AND FINISH YOUR GLASS OF WINE.

18:36.406 --> 18:40.035
- HEY,
WE COULD PLAY ANOTHER GAME.

18:40.118 --> 18:42.663
I LIKE GAMES.

18:42.746 --> 18:44.915
- SO DO I.

18:44.998 --> 18:47.084
- I HAVE AN IDEA.

18:47.167 --> 18:48.919
WE COULD READ
THE PLAY WE WROTE.

18:49.002 --> 18:50.879
- YOUR VERSION OR MINE?

18:50.963 --> 18:54.216
- LET'S MAKE IT A MASH-UP.

18:54.299 --> 18:55.884
AND YOU GUYS
COULD BE IN IT, TOO.

18:55.968 --> 19:00.556
YOU COULD ALL READ PARTS.

19:00.639 --> 19:03.559
- OR...

19:03.642 --> 19:06.228
TO PLAY DEVIL'S ADVOCATE,
WE COULD NOT DO THAT,

19:06.311 --> 19:07.896
AND I COULD TAKE YOU ALL OUT

19:07.980 --> 19:11.441
FOR A SUMPTUOUS REPAST
AT FINIQUE.

19:11.525 --> 19:15.696
- THAT'S BRILLIANT.
LET'S DO THAT.

19:15.779 --> 19:17.489
- WE SHOULD HAVE TOLD THEM

19:17.573 --> 19:22.494
THERE WERE VAMPIRES
IN OUR PLAY.

19:26.331 --> 19:28.417
- YOU WERE RIGHT.
COMPUTERS ARE AMAZING.

19:28.500 --> 19:31.712
- JUST DON'T
DOWNLOAD <i> ANGRY BIRDS.</i>

19:31.795 --> 19:35.799
IT'S THE MOTHER
OF ALL TIME-SUCKS.

19:35.883 --> 19:38.135
- LET'S READ BACK
WHAT WE JUST WROTE.

19:38.218 --> 19:41.972
I'LL BE VAMPIRE SCARLETT,
YOU BE VAMPIRE RHETT.

19:42.055 --> 19:45.601
- [deep voice]
"EVENING, MISS SCARLETT."

19:45.684 --> 19:47.394
- "OH, RHETT, WHAT TIMING.

19:47.477 --> 19:51.940
"WE JUST DRAINED
A FRESH YANKEE.

19:52.024 --> 19:55.569
MAMMY'S MIXING UP
BLOODY JULEPS."

19:55.652 --> 19:58.447
- THIS IS GOOD.

19:58.530 --> 20:01.658
- SPEAKING OF JULEPS,
ISN'T IT COCKTAIL TIME?

20:01.742 --> 20:05.120
- AFTER ALL,
WE ARE WRITERS.

20:05.203 --> 20:09.166
- I STILL THINK WE CAN KICK
THE SCRIPT UP A NOTCH.

20:09.249 --> 20:11.960
- WHAT ABOUT A
VAMPIRE-ON-WEREWOLF LOVE SCENE?

20:12.044 --> 20:14.296
- HOW ABOUT WE THROW
IN A CYBORG?

20:14.379 --> 20:15.839
- NO.

20:15.923 --> 20:17.633
THEY DIDN'T HAVE
THE TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE CYBORGS

20:17.716 --> 20:19.134
IN THE CIVIL WAR.

20:19.217 --> 20:22.638
GET YOUR HEAD IN THE GAME.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.306
- WELL,
GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOUR--

20:24.389 --> 20:27.601
OOH, VODKA.

20:27.684 --> 20:29.436
YOU KNOW ME SO WELL.

20:29.519 --> 20:30.812
[laughing]
