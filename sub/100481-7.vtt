WEBVTT

00:25.667 --> 00:27.266
>> John: HELLO THERE!

00:27.333 --> 00:28.967
AND WELCOME TO ANOTHER OF THESE

00:29.033 --> 00:31.100
SLIGHTLY STRANGE SHOWS.

00:31.166 --> 00:32.834
THANKS FOR JOINING ME AGAIN IN

00:32.900 --> 00:34.133
MY EMPTY WHITE VOID.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.500
FOR THOSE WHO ARE WONDERING,

00:35.567 --> 00:37.734
I CHOSE THIS COLOR MYSELF --

00:37.800 --> 00:40.066
IT'S CALLED "WHALE JIZZ" AND I

00:40.133 --> 00:41.133
THINK IT'S ELEGANT, AND ALSO A

00:41.200 --> 00:42.500
PERFECT WALL, INCIDENTALLY, FOR

00:42.567 --> 00:43.900
A VINTAGE PIECE OF PENNSYLVANIA

00:43.967 --> 00:49.467
RAT EROTICA.

00:49.533 --> 00:50.400
WE MAY ACTUALLY HAVE A LEAD

00:50.467 --> 00:52.467
ON THAT PAINTING.

00:52.533 --> 00:53.633
WATCH THIS SPACE FOR SOME

00:53.700 --> 00:54.033
GOOD NEWS SOON.

00:54.100 --> 00:55.266
ANYWAY, IT'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN

00:55.333 --> 00:55.867
ANOTHER LONG, DIFFICULT WEEK.

00:55.934 --> 00:56.533
THE CORONAVIRUS IS STILL

00:56.600 --> 00:57.767
DOMINATING THE NEWS, AND WE'RE

00:57.834 --> 00:58.800
ALL HANDLING ISOLATION IN

00:58.867 --> 00:59.667
DIFFERENT WAYS.

00:59.734 --> 01:01.633
JEREMY RENNER, FOR EXAMPLE, HAS

01:01.700 --> 01:06.133
DECIDED THAT NOW IS THE PERFECT

01:06.200 --> 01:08.633
TIME FOR HIM TO RELEASE HIS

01:08.700 --> 01:09.633
DEBUT EP OF SONGS, TITLED

01:09.700 --> 01:10.000
"THE MEDICINE."

01:10.066 --> 01:10.734
HAVE I HEARD IT?

01:10.800 --> 01:11.333
NO.

01:11.400 --> 01:12.066
I HAVEN'T ENTERED THE

01:12.133 --> 01:13.000
"LET'S GIVE JEREMY RENNER'S

01:13.066 --> 01:13.667
ALBUM AN HONEST CHANCE" STAGE OF

01:13.734 --> 01:14.233
SELF-QUARANTINE YET, AND I

01:14.300 --> 01:15.033
REALLY HOPE THAT I DON'T GET

01:15.100 --> 01:16.033
THERE.

01:16.100 --> 01:17.066
BECAUSE APPARENTLY, IT SOUNDS

01:17.133 --> 01:18.533
LIKE THIS:

01:18.600 --> 01:21.734
>> ♪ I NEVER SAID I WAS SORRY ♪

01:21.800 --> 01:24.767
♪ I AIN'T SORRY ♪

01:24.834 --> 01:27.433
♪ NEVER SORRY ♪

01:27.500 --> 01:28.934
>> John: I HATE THIS MOMENT IN

01:29.000 --> 01:32.467
HUMAN HISTORY SO MUCH.

01:32.533 --> 01:34.000
WELL, THIS WAS ALSO THE WEEK

01:34.066 --> 01:35.734
DONALD TRUMP SEEMED TO AT LEAST

01:35.800 --> 01:37.133
TEMPORARILY ACKNOWLEDGE JUST HOW

01:37.200 --> 01:38.900
DIRE THIS SITUATION IS.

01:38.967 --> 01:40.200
HE HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE

01:40.266 --> 01:42.333
ANNOUNCING THAT THIS VIRUS COULD

01:42.400 --> 01:44.166
KILL BETWEEN 100,000 AND 240,000

01:44.233 --> 01:45.767
AMERICANS -- QUICKLY ADDING

01:45.834 --> 01:47.166
THAT, HAD HE DONE NOTHING, THERE

01:47.233 --> 01:48.166
COULD'VE BEEN OVER 2 MILLION

01:48.233 --> 01:51.300
DEATHS, AND THEN SAYING THIS:

01:51.367 --> 01:53.433
>> IF WE CAN HOLD THAT DOWN, AS

01:53.500 --> 01:55.266
WE'RE SAYING, TO 100,000 --

01:55.333 --> 01:57.233
THAT'S A HORRIBLE NUMBER --

01:57.300 --> 02:00.233
MAYBE EVEN LESS, BUT TO 100,000,

02:00.300 --> 02:02.367
SO WE HAVE BETWEEN 100,000 AND

02:02.433 --> 02:03.767
200,000 -- WE ALTOGETHER

02:03.834 --> 02:06.900
HAVE DONE A VERY GOOD JOB.

02:06.967 --> 02:07.834
>> John: OKAY, SETTING ASIDE THE

02:07.900 --> 02:09.066
FACT THAT LEADING DISEASE

02:09.133 --> 02:10.700
FORECASTERS ARE MYSTIFIED AT HOW

02:10.767 --> 02:12.700
TRUMP GOT TO THOSE FIGURES,

02:12.767 --> 02:14.500
TRYING TO SPIN 200,000 DEATHS AS

02:14.567 --> 02:16.367
A "GOOD JOB" BECAUSE IT'S NOT

02:16.433 --> 02:19.033
MILLIONS IS THE MOST CALLOUS WAY

02:19.133 --> 02:20.700
TO MINIMIZE THE DEATHS OF

02:20.767 --> 02:24.600
AMERICANS IMAGINABLE, WERE IT

02:24.633 --> 02:25.700
NOT FOR THE FACT THAT TRUMP

02:25.767 --> 02:26.900
RESPONDED TO 9/11 -- ON 9/11 --

02:26.967 --> 02:28.400
BY POINTING OUT THAT HE USED TO

02:28.467 --> 02:30.266
OWN THE SECOND-TALLEST BUILDING

02:30.333 --> 02:30.967
IN DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN AND NOW HE

02:31.066 --> 02:32.367
OWNED THE TALLEST.

02:32.433 --> 02:33.500
AND THE THING IS, THAT WASN'T

02:33.567 --> 02:34.567
JUST OFFENSIVE, IT WASN'T EVEN

02:34.633 --> 02:36.300
TRUE.

02:36.367 --> 02:37.900
#NeverForget,

02:37.967 --> 02:39.300
#ThatOurPresident

02:39.367 --> 02:42.567
IsAnIndescribableDick.

02:42.633 --> 02:43.633
AND FOR THE RECORD, DEATHS IN

02:43.700 --> 02:45.467
THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS WERE

02:45.533 --> 02:47.100
NOT INEVITABLE HERE.

02:47.166 --> 02:48.533
THE FEDERAL RESPONSE UNDER TRUMP

02:48.600 --> 02:50.934
HAS ACTIVELY MADE THINGS WORSE,

02:51.000 --> 02:52.400
PARTICULARLY THE BOTCHED ROLLOUT

02:52.467 --> 02:54.133
OF TESTING THAT CONTINUES TO

02:54.200 --> 02:55.166
UNDERMINE ALMOST EVERY EFFORT TO

02:55.233 --> 02:57.300
CONTAIN THIS VIRUS.

02:57.367 --> 03:02.367
AND YET TRUMP HAS REPEATEDLY

03:02.433 --> 03:03.300
SUGGESTED THAT IT'S THE STATES'

03:03.367 --> 03:04.400
RESPONSIBILITY TO FIX THINGS --

03:04.467 --> 03:05.100
AN ATTITUDE WHICH REACHED

03:05.166 --> 03:06.033
ITS APEX ON THURSDAY WHEN

03:06.100 --> 03:07.367
JARED KUSHNER -- A MAN WHO LOOKS

03:07.433 --> 03:08.834
LESS LIKE SOMEONE WHO COULD

03:08.900 --> 03:10.467
HANDLE A GLOBAL PANDEMIC AND

03:10.533 --> 03:12.033
MORE LIKE AN ALT-RIGHT

03:12.100 --> 03:15.700
PINOCCHIO -- SUGGESTED THAT

03:15.767 --> 03:16.934
STATES SHOULD NOT COUNT ON A

03:17.000 --> 03:17.567
FEDERAL STOCKPILE OF MEDICAL

03:17.633 --> 03:18.166
SUPPLIES.

03:18.233 --> 03:19.433
>> THE NOTION OF THE FEDERAL

03:19.500 --> 03:20.633
STOCKPILE WAS, IT'S SUPPOSED TO

03:20.700 --> 03:22.166
BE OUR STOCKPILE.

03:22.233 --> 03:22.934
IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE STATES'

03:23.000 --> 03:23.667
STOCKPILES THAT THEY THEN USE.

03:23.734 --> 03:24.767
>> John: WAIT.

03:24.834 --> 03:26.233
"OUR" STOCKPILE?

03:26.300 --> 03:27.867
IT'S NOT YOUR STOCKPILE.

03:27.934 --> 03:29.600
IT'S A NATIONAL STOCKPILE FOR

03:29.667 --> 03:30.633
USE BY THE UNITED STATES, YOU

03:30.700 --> 03:32.233
FUCKING MORON.

03:32.300 --> 03:33.433
AND HERE'S THE INTERESTING THING

03:33.500 --> 03:34.600
ABOUT THE UNITED STATES:

03:34.667 --> 03:35.633
IT'S ALMOST ENTIRELY MADE OF

03:35.700 --> 03:36.900
STATES.

03:36.967 --> 03:41.633
THERE'S STATES EVERYWHERE.

03:41.700 --> 03:42.333
I'D SAY MORE THAN 40 OF THEM,

03:42.400 --> 03:42.734
JARED.

03:42.800 --> 03:43.633
AND SOME PARTS OF THEM BADLY

03:43.700 --> 03:45.166
NEED SUPPLIES RIGHT NOW, LIKE

03:45.233 --> 03:47.100
THE CITY THAT YOU USED TO LIVE

03:47.166 --> 03:47.900
IN AND IN WHICH I PRAY YOU

03:47.967 --> 03:48.700
NEVER SHOW YOUR POLISHED FUCKING

03:48.767 --> 03:49.800
FACE AGAIN.

03:49.867 --> 03:51.233
SO WITH STATES BEING LEFT TO

03:51.300 --> 03:52.433
PICK UP THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S

03:52.500 --> 03:54.533
SLACK, YOUR FATE MAY COME DOWN

03:54.600 --> 03:55.500
NOW TO HOW GOOD YOUR GOVERNOR

03:55.567 --> 03:56.700
IS.

03:56.767 --> 03:58.533
AND SOME HAVE DONE WELL.

03:58.600 --> 04:00.266
GAVIN NEWSOM IN CALIFORNIA AND

04:00.333 --> 04:01.400
MIKE DeWINE IN OHIO BOTH

04:01.467 --> 04:02.934
STARTED CANCELING PUBLIC EVENTS

04:03.000 --> 04:03.934
IN EARLY MARCH.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.633
OTHERS, LIKE ANDREW CUOMO IN

04:05.700 --> 04:07.166
NEW YORK, HAVE AGGRESSIVELY

04:07.233 --> 04:08.467
MANAGED THE CRISIS, ALTHOUGH HE

04:08.533 --> 04:10.266
HAS BEEN DRAGGING HIS FEET ON

04:10.333 --> 04:11.333
MITIGATING THE SPREAD WITHIN

04:11.400 --> 04:12.900
NEW YORK'S JAILS AND PRISONS,

04:12.967 --> 04:13.667
WHICH IS NOT IDEAL.

04:13.734 --> 04:15.567
NOR IS THE FACT HE WORE A WHITE

04:15.633 --> 04:17.467
POLO SHIRT THIS WEEK THAT FORCED

04:17.533 --> 04:18.300
US ALL TO CONSIDER WHETHER OR

04:18.367 --> 04:21.500
NOT HE HAS NIPPLE RINGS.

04:21.567 --> 04:23.000
AND IF HE DOES, AT LEAST HE'S

04:23.066 --> 04:24.100
HANDLING THIS PUBLIC HEALTH

04:24.166 --> 04:25.500
CRISIS FAIRLY WELL, EVEN AS HE

04:25.567 --> 04:27.467
HANDLES A MIDLIFE CRISIS VERY

04:27.533 --> 04:28.600
POORLY.

04:28.667 --> 04:29.633
BUT OTHER GOVERNORS HAVE BEEN

04:29.700 --> 04:31.767
ACTIVELY IRRESPONSIBLE.

04:31.834 --> 04:33.400
>> TONIGHT, MOUNTING PRESSURE ON

04:33.467 --> 04:34.633
THE GOVERNORS WHO HAVE REFUSED

04:34.700 --> 04:35.900
TO ISSUE STAY-AT-HOME ORDERS.

04:35.967 --> 04:37.767
GEORGIA HELD OUT UNTIL EARLIER

04:37.834 --> 04:39.266
THIS WEEK, THE GOVERNOR

04:39.333 --> 04:40.200
INSISTING HE ONLY NOW LEARNED

04:40.266 --> 04:41.767
THAT PEOPLE WITHOUT SYMPTOMS

04:41.834 --> 04:43.633
COULD SPREAD THE DISEASE.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.133
>> YOU KNOW, FINDING OUT THAT

04:45.200 --> 04:46.867
THIS VIRUS IS NOW TRANSMITTING

04:46.934 --> 04:48.834
BEFORE PEOPLE SEE SIGNS, THOSE

04:48.900 --> 04:50.000
INDIVIDUALS COULD'VE BEEN

04:50.066 --> 04:51.667
INFECTING PEOPLE BEFORE THEY

04:51.734 --> 04:53.300
EVER FELT BAD, WELL, WE DIDN'T

04:53.367 --> 04:54.867
KNOW THAT UNTIL THE LAST

04:54.934 --> 04:56.867
24 HOURS.

04:56.934 --> 04:57.900
>> John: NO, "YOU" DIDN'T KNOW

04:57.967 --> 04:59.500
THAT UNTIL THE LAST 24 HOURS.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.033
MOST OF THE REST OF US HAVE

05:01.100 --> 05:02.633
KNOWN THAT SINCE FEBRUARY.

05:02.700 --> 05:03.834
AND THAT INFORMATION, MUCH LIKE

05:03.900 --> 05:06.600
COVID-19, HAS SPREAD A BIT SINCE

05:06.667 --> 05:08.600
THEN.

05:08.667 --> 05:10.367
BUT HONESTLY, THE PERSON I FEEL

05:10.433 --> 05:11.100
WORST FOR THERE, OTHER THAN

05:11.166 --> 05:12.700
EVERY GEORGIAN, IS KEMP'S

05:12.767 --> 05:14.033
INTERPRETER, BECAUSE HAVING TO

05:14.100 --> 05:15.467
COMMUNICATE HARMFUL NONSENSE IS

05:15.533 --> 05:16.633
JUST A WASTE OF HIS CONSIDERABLE

05:16.700 --> 05:17.934
TALENTS.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.667
THIS GUY HERE IS AN ARTIST.

05:19.734 --> 05:22.066
NEED PROOF?

05:22.133 --> 05:23.133
HERE HE IS INTERPRETING A

05:23.200 --> 05:29.867
BEYONCE SONG AT ATLANTA PRIDE.

05:29.934 --> 05:30.500
>> ♪ TONIGHT ♪

05:30.567 --> 05:31.200
♪ AIN'T NO SHAME 'CAUSE I GOTTA

05:31.266 --> 05:32.100
GET MINE ♪

05:32.166 --> 05:32.967

05:34.266 --> 05:34.967

05:35.033 --> 05:36.567
>> John: SLAY, KING.

05:36.633 --> 05:37.734
CALL ME AN ASYMPTOMATIC CARRIER

05:37.800 --> 05:38.734
BECAUSE THAT PERFORMANCE IS

05:38.800 --> 05:41.367
LIVING INSIDE ME RIGHT NOW.

05:41.433 --> 05:42.567
AND KEMP'S ISN'T THE WORST

05:42.633 --> 05:44.500
REASONING FOR INACTION.

05:44.567 --> 05:45.734
ALABAMA'S GOVERNOR, KAY IVEY,

05:45.800 --> 05:47.600
RESISTED CALLS FOR STATEWIDE

05:47.667 --> 05:49.300
STAY-AT-HOME ORDERS UNTIL JUST A

05:49.367 --> 05:50.633
COUPLE OF DAYS AGO, CITING ONE

05:50.700 --> 05:52.200
SIMPLE TRUTH.

05:52.266 --> 05:53.734
>> WE AREN'T CALIFORNIA.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.333
WE ARE NOT NEW YORK.

05:56.400 --> 05:59.533
I DO NOT BELIEVE OUR ECONOMY

05:59.600 --> 06:01.266
NEEDS A FULL SHELTER-IN-PLACE

06:01.333 --> 06:02.367
ORDER AS SOME OTHER STATES HAVE

06:02.433 --> 06:04.200
DONE -- NOT AT THIS TIME AND

06:04.266 --> 06:06.767
HOPEFULLY NOT EVER.

06:06.834 --> 06:07.934
>> John: NOW, I'LL GIVE HER

06:08.000 --> 06:09.633
THIS: ALABAMA ISN'T CALIFORNIA

06:09.700 --> 06:10.967
OR NEW YORK.

06:11.033 --> 06:12.767
IT IS, OF COURSE, ALABAMA,

06:12.834 --> 06:14.066
A STATE WHOSE FLAG SAYS

06:14.133 --> 06:15.567
"WE'RE WORKING ON IT," WHOSE

06:15.633 --> 06:17.400
SEAL SAYS "THIS IS WHERE ALABAMA

06:17.467 --> 06:19.200
IS," AND WHOSE "STATE FACTS"

06:19.266 --> 06:21.367
PAGE ON 50States.com IS JUST --

06:21.433 --> 06:22.533
AND THIS IS TRUE -- 50 FACTS

06:22.600 --> 06:24.333
ABOUT INDIANA.

06:24.400 --> 06:25.800
WHICH IS RIDICULOUS, BECAUSE

06:25.867 --> 06:27.133
THERE ARE CLEARLY LOTS OF

06:27.200 --> 06:29.567
INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT ALABAMA.

06:29.633 --> 06:31.066
ONE IS THAT IT ACTUALLY HAS A

06:31.133 --> 06:32.767
HIGHER GROWTH RATE IN

06:32.834 --> 06:33.734
CORONAVIRUS CASES THAN

06:33.800 --> 06:34.834
CALIFORNIA.

06:34.900 --> 06:37.433
HEY, GOVERNOR, MAYBE THAT

06:37.500 --> 06:38.467
GRAPH SHOULD BE ON YOUR FLAG!

06:38.533 --> 06:40.133
ISN'T LEARNING FUN?

06:40.200 --> 06:41.734
BUT ARGUABLY THE WORST

06:41.800 --> 06:43.400
GUBERNATORIAL RESPONSE HAS COME

06:43.467 --> 06:44.800
FROM FLORIDA'S RON DeSANTIS --

06:44.867 --> 06:46.233
WHAT YOU'D GET IF A SEXUAL

06:46.300 --> 06:47.433
HARASSMENT ALLEGATION FUCKED A

06:47.500 --> 06:49.367
TOYOTA CAMRY.

06:49.433 --> 06:51.333
FLORIDA SAW AN EXPLOSION OF

06:51.400 --> 06:52.400
CASES THROUGHOUT THE MONTH OF

06:52.467 --> 06:54.467
MARCH, WHICH IS ESPECIALLY

06:54.533 --> 06:55.400
ALARMING IN A STATE WHERE ONE IN

06:55.467 --> 06:58.834
FIVE RESIDENTS ARE OVER 65.

06:58.900 --> 06:59.900
BUT DeSANTIS CONTINUED TO

06:59.967 --> 07:01.233
SUGGEST HE WOULD ONLY ISSUE A

07:01.300 --> 07:03.000
STATEWIDE ORDER IF THE PRESIDENT

07:03.066 --> 07:04.734
TOLD HIM TO, SO IT WAS OFTEN UP

07:04.800 --> 07:06.934
TO COUNTIES TO SET THEIR OWN

07:07.000 --> 07:07.967
POLICIES, WHICH HAD SOME PRETTY

07:08.033 --> 07:09.667
OBVIOUS SHORTCOMINGS, PERHAPS

07:09.734 --> 07:11.100
BEST SUMMED UP BY THIS PHOTO OF

07:11.166 --> 07:12.467
A FLORIDA BEACH IN WHICH YOU CAN

07:12.533 --> 07:14.667
SEE THE LINE BETWEEN ONE COUNTY

07:14.700 --> 07:16.300
THAT HAD CLOSED ITS BEACHES AND

07:16.367 --> 07:17.667
ONE THAT HADN'T.

07:17.734 --> 07:19.266
AND THIS MAY SURPRISE YOU, BUT

07:19.333 --> 07:19.967
LITERALLY DRAWING A LINE IN THE

07:20.033 --> 07:21.767
SAND ISN'T ACTUALLY AN EFFECTIVE

07:21.834 --> 07:25.433
PUBLIC HEALTH STRATEGY.

07:25.500 --> 07:26.934
AND EVEN WHEN DeSANTIS FINALLY

07:27.000 --> 07:28.734
DID THE RIGHT THING THIS WEEK,

07:28.800 --> 07:30.400
HE STILL MANAGED TO FUCK IT UP.

07:30.467 --> 07:31.467
>> IN FLORIDA, A STAY-AT-HOME

07:31.533 --> 07:34.100
ORDER GOING INTO EFFECT TODAY,

07:34.166 --> 07:35.533
BUT ONLY AFTER GOVERNOR

07:35.600 --> 07:36.333
RON DeSANTIS OFFERED AN

07:36.400 --> 07:37.333
EXCEPTION FOR RELIGIOUS

07:37.400 --> 07:38.367
SERVICES.

07:38.433 --> 07:39.533
>> I DON'T THINK THE GOVERNMENT

07:39.600 --> 07:40.667
HAS THE AUTHORITY TO CLOSE A

07:40.734 --> 07:41.333
CHURCH.

07:41.400 --> 07:42.300
I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO DO

07:42.367 --> 07:45.800
THAT.

07:45.867 --> 07:47.500
>> John: THAT'S ACTUALLY EVEN

07:47.567 --> 07:49.166
STUPIDER THAN THAT SOUNDS.

07:49.233 --> 07:50.433
BECAUSE DeSANTIS NOT ONLY

07:50.500 --> 07:51.533
EXEMPTED CHURCHES FROM BANS ON

07:51.600 --> 07:53.767
LARGE GATHERINGS, HE ALSO

07:53.834 --> 07:54.367
EXEMPTED THEM FROM

07:54.433 --> 07:55.166
SOCIAL DISTANCING

07:55.233 --> 07:56.033
REQUIREMENTS AND MADE IT

07:56.100 --> 07:56.767
IMPOSSIBLE FOR LOCALITIES --

07:56.834 --> 07:57.800
EVEN IN HOT SPOTS -- TO OVERRIDE

07:57.867 --> 08:01.300
HIM.

08:01.367 --> 08:02.266
WHICH IS CLEARLY DANGEROUS.

08:02.333 --> 08:03.400
YOU'RE NOT PROTECTED FROM THE

08:03.467 --> 08:04.033
CORONAVIRUS JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE

08:04.100 --> 08:04.500
IN CHURCH.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.033
WE DON'T SAY "BLESS YOU" AFTER

08:06.100 --> 08:07.700
PEOPLE SNEEZE TO THANK GOD FOR

08:07.767 --> 08:09.400
CATCHING THE SNEEZE AND THROWING

08:09.467 --> 08:10.600
IT IN GERM JAIL WITH ALL THE

08:10.667 --> 08:11.767
OTHER SNEEZES.

08:11.834 --> 08:13.000
THAT'S NOT A SERVICE GOD

08:13.066 --> 08:14.934
PROVIDES.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.333
THE PROBLEM IS, AS A NATION, OUR

08:17.400 --> 08:19.433
SUCCESS IN CONTAINING COVID-19

08:19.500 --> 08:21.066
IS ONLY GOING TO BE AS GOOD AS

08:21.133 --> 08:22.367
OUR WORST GOVERNOR, ESPECIALLY

08:22.433 --> 08:24.133
WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

08:24.200 --> 08:25.133
ABDICATING SO MUCH

08:25.200 --> 08:29.900
RESPONSIBILITY.

08:29.967 --> 08:30.900
THAT IS WHAT IS SO INFURIATING

08:30.967 --> 08:31.133
HERE.

08:31.200 --> 08:34.367
IT'S HARD TO THINK OF A WAY TO

08:34.433 --> 08:35.567
FULLY EXPRESS THE QUANDARY THAT

08:35.633 --> 08:36.600
WE'RE IN, BUT JARED KUSHNER MAY

08:36.667 --> 08:37.233
INADVERTENTLY HAVE SUMMED IT UP

08:37.300 --> 08:38.000
THE BEST.

08:38.066 --> 08:39.367
>> WHAT A LOT OF THE VOTERS ARE

08:39.433 --> 08:39.967
SEEING NOW IS THAT WHEN YOU

08:40.033 --> 08:41.367
ELECT SOMEBODY TO BE A MAYOR OR

08:41.433 --> 08:42.533
A GOVERNOR OR A PRESIDENT,

08:42.600 --> 08:43.467
YOU'RE TRYING TO THINK ABOUT WHO

08:43.533 --> 08:44.900
WILL BE A COMPETENT MANAGER

08:44.967 --> 08:46.033
DURING THE TIME OF CRISIS.

08:46.100 --> 08:47.500
THIS IS A TIME OF CRISIS, AND

08:47.567 --> 08:48.800
YOU'RE SEEING CERTAIN PEOPLE ARE

08:48.867 --> 08:51.834
BETTER MANAGERS THAN OTHERS.

08:51.900 --> 08:53.533
>> John: YEAH, NO SHIT, JARED.

08:53.600 --> 08:54.800
CERTAIN PEOPLE ARE BETTER

08:54.867 --> 08:56.166
MANAGERS THAN OTHERS.

08:56.233 --> 08:57.767
AND UNFORTUNATELY, IT SEEMS

08:57.834 --> 08:58.867
CERTAIN OTHER PEOPLE ARE CONTENT

08:58.934 --> 09:00.033
TO SIT BACK AND WATCH THE BAD

09:00.100 --> 09:02.100
ONES MAKE DECISIONS THAT WILL

09:02.166 --> 09:03.600
COST PEOPLE'S LIVES, ALL IN THE

09:03.667 --> 09:05.700
HOPES THAT AMERICANS WILL ALL

09:05.767 --> 09:06.533
LEARN A VALUABLE LESSON WHILE

09:06.600 --> 09:08.066
DYING.

09:08.133 --> 09:09.867
AND LOOK, I KNOW JARED KUSHNER

09:09.934 --> 09:11.300
MUST HAVE A STOCKPILE OF EMPATHY

09:11.367 --> 09:15.033
IN THERE SOMEWHERE, BUT IT

09:15.100 --> 09:16.467
APPEARS THAT THAT'S HIS EMPATHY,

09:16.533 --> 09:18.200
AND HE'S NOT ALLOWED TO EXTEND

09:18.266 --> 09:19.100
IT TO ANYONE ELSE.

09:19.166 --> 09:20.533
AND NOW THIS.

09:20.600 --> 09:22.667
>> Announcer: AND NOW, ARE YOU

09:22.734 --> 09:23.800
WEARING PANTS?

09:23.867 --> 09:25.166
>> THIS IS KIND OF FUN.

09:25.233 --> 09:28.433
WE HANG OUT AT BEN'S PLACE AND

09:28.500 --> 09:31.233
THEN WE GO TO BERNIE'S HOUSE FOR

09:31.300 --> 09:32.300
AWHILE AND THEN WE ALL GO BACK

09:32.367 --> 09:33.000
TO BEN'S.

09:33.066 --> 09:33.633
>> I WONDER IF EITHER OF THEM

09:33.700 --> 09:34.300
ARE WEARING PANTS.

09:34.367 --> 09:35.100
>> I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU.

09:35.166 --> 09:35.834
>> YES?

09:35.900 --> 09:37.200
>> ARE YOU WEARING PANTS?

09:37.266 --> 09:39.400
>> KIM, WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

09:39.467 --> 09:40.233
>> LET'S SEE.

09:40.300 --> 09:41.533
>> I'M WEARING PANTS.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.533
>> I HAVE PANTS ON.

09:43.600 --> 09:47.066
YES.

09:47.133 --> 09:52.066
YES, YES, YOU'RE JUST GOING

09:52.133 --> 09:53.166
TO TAKE MY WORD ON THAT, BECAUSE

09:53.233 --> 09:53.633
I'M NOT STANDING UP.

09:53.700 --> 09:54.734
>> THE QUESTION IS, ARE YOU

09:54.800 --> 09:55.767
WEARING PANTS?

09:55.834 --> 09:56.667
>> ARE YOU WEARING PANTS?

09:56.734 --> 10:01.000
>> ARE YOU WEARING PANTS?

10:01.066 --> 10:02.600
>> PARTY ON THE BOTTOM.

10:02.667 --> 10:03.533
>> ARE YOU WEARING PANTS?

10:03.600 --> 10:04.033
>> OH.

10:04.100 --> 10:06.967
>> OH.

10:07.033 --> 10:10.166
>> I AM NOT.

10:10.233 --> 10:11.467
>> I GET A 30-SECOND COMMUTE

10:11.533 --> 10:12.900
INTO THE OFFICE THIS MORNING.

10:12.967 --> 10:13.567
>> THANK YOU, STEVE.

10:13.633 --> 10:16.266
>> ARE YOU WEARING PANTS?

10:16.333 --> 10:16.934
>> OH.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.300
>> YOU KNOW, BECKY, WE DON'T

10:18.367 --> 10:21.867
HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THAT.

10:21.934 --> 10:25.400
BUT, YOU KNOW --

10:25.467 --> 10:27.367
>> I'LL TAKE THAT AS A NO.

10:27.433 --> 10:29.967
>> THE WHOLE SUIT DOESN'T HAVE

10:30.033 --> 10:30.333
TO GO ON.

10:30.400 --> 10:31.000
LET'S JUST BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT.

10:31.066 --> 10:31.767
>> ARE THEY REALLY TIGHT AND

10:31.834 --> 10:32.533
GETTING TIGHTER, STEVE?

10:32.600 --> 10:33.667
>> John: MOVING ON.

10:33.734 --> 10:34.667
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

10:34.734 --> 10:36.100
THE NEWS MEDIA: YOU KNOW, THE

10:36.166 --> 10:37.433
PEOPLE WHO ANNOUNCED TO THE

10:37.500 --> 10:39.400
WORLD THAT MAN HAD LANDED ON THE

10:39.467 --> 10:40.300
MOON, WORLD WAR II HAD ENDED,

10:40.367 --> 10:42.300
AND WHO WILL ONE DAY ANNOUNCE

10:42.367 --> 10:43.166
MY TRAGIC DEATH AFTER

10:43.233 --> 10:44.800
A PELICAN SWALLOWS ME WHOLE.

10:44.867 --> 10:45.967
LOOK, I LOVE CORN DOGS, THE

10:46.033 --> 10:47.200
PIER, AND TAUNTING LARGE BIRDS.

10:47.266 --> 10:49.500
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME.

10:49.567 --> 10:50.934
TRUMP HAS MADE NO SECRET OF HIS

10:51.000 --> 10:52.567
DISDAIN FOR THE MEDIA, BUT HE'S

10:52.633 --> 10:54.100
ALSO BEEN HOLDING A LOT OF PRESS

10:54.166 --> 10:55.266
CONFERENCES RECENTLY, WHICH HAS

10:55.333 --> 10:57.066
HIGHLIGHTED THE FACT THAT THERE

10:57.133 --> 10:59.200
IS ONE MEDIA OUTLET HE SEEMS TO

10:59.266 --> 11:00.800
REALLY ENJOY CALLING ON.

11:00.867 --> 11:02.066
>> OKAY.

11:02.133 --> 11:03.600
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS.

11:03.667 --> 11:04.500
GO AHEAD, OAN?

11:04.567 --> 11:06.767
WE'LL TAKE A FEW QUESTIONS.

11:06.834 --> 11:07.467
EMERALD?

11:07.533 --> 11:08.633
OAN?

11:08.700 --> 11:09.734
OAN, PLEASE, OAN?

11:09.800 --> 11:10.400
OAN?

11:10.467 --> 11:11.233
OAN?

11:11.300 --> 11:12.367
OAN?

11:12.433 --> 11:14.000
>> YES, SIR.

11:14.066 --> 11:14.700
>> VERY GOOD.

11:14.767 --> 11:15.433
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.667
>> I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS.

11:16.734 --> 11:18.266
>> YOU TREAT ME VERY NICELY.

11:18.333 --> 11:28.533
>> John: OKAY, INSTINCTIVELY,

11:28.600 --> 11:30.467
YOU KNOW THAT WHEN TRUMP LIKES

11:30.533 --> 11:31.033
SOMETHING THAT MUCH IS AN

11:31.100 --> 11:31.567
IMMEDIATE RED FLAG.

11:31.633 --> 11:32.400
TAKE THIS CAPYBARA WITH AN

11:32.467 --> 11:33.100
ORANGE ON ITS HEAD.

11:33.166 --> 11:34.033
IT SEEMS EXCELLENT, BUT IF TRUMP

11:34.100 --> 11:34.633
WERE TO REPEATEDLY SAY "I LOVE

11:34.700 --> 11:35.266
THAT CAPYBARA WITH AN ORANGE ON

11:35.333 --> 11:36.433
ITS HEAD," YOU JUST KNOW WE'RE

11:36.500 --> 11:37.066
ABOUT TO FIND OUT ALL THE TIMES

11:37.133 --> 11:39.667
IT WORE BLACKFACE IN COLLEGE.

11:39.734 --> 11:41.100
OAN STANDS FOR "ONE AMERICA

11:41.166 --> 11:44.066
NEWS," AND WHEN YOU HEAR THE

11:44.133 --> 11:45.834
KINDS OF QUESTIONS THAT THEY

11:45.900 --> 11:47.300
ASK, YOU BEGIN TO SEE WHY TRUMP

11:47.367 --> 11:48.166
CALLS ON THEM SO MUCH:

11:48.233 --> 11:49.133
>> MR. PRESIDENT, YOUR APPROVAL

11:49.200 --> 11:50.333
RATINGS HAVE BEEN THE HIGHEST

11:50.400 --> 11:50.967
THEY'VE EVER BEEN, AS WELL AS

11:51.033 --> 11:51.700
THE RATINGS ON YOUR HANDLING OF

11:51.767 --> 11:53.133
THE VIRUS.

11:53.200 --> 11:54.367
YET THERE ARE SOME NETWORKS THAT

11:54.433 --> 11:55.266
ARE SAYING THEY'RE DEBATING

11:55.333 --> 11:56.333
WHETHER OR NOT TO CARRY THESE

11:56.400 --> 11:57.500
BRIEFINGS LIVE.

11:57.600 --> 11:58.500
DO YOU THINK THERE'S A LINK

11:58.600 --> 11:59.734
BETWEEN THE TWO?

11:59.800 --> 12:02.767
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

12:02.834 --> 12:04.033
I KNOW THAT --

12:04.100 --> 12:04.867
BOY, THAT'S A NICE QUESTION.

12:04.967 --> 12:06.567
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

12:06.633 --> 12:07.233
>> John: WAS THAT A NICE

12:07.300 --> 12:08.233
QUESTION THOUGH?

12:08.300 --> 12:10.633
I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOUR

12:10.700 --> 12:11.867
DEFINITION OF ONE IS: IF A NICE

12:11.934 --> 12:13.834
QUESTION IS MEANT TO EXTRACT ANY

12:13.900 --> 12:16.900
USEFUL INFORMATION, THEN IT

12:16.967 --> 12:18.100
WASN'T NICE, BUT IF IT'S

12:18.166 --> 12:19.000
ONE THAT MAKES THE PRESIDENT

12:19.066 --> 12:20.200
FEEL HAPPY FOR A BRIEF INSTANT

12:20.266 --> 12:22.133
BEFORE THAT FEELING, LIKE ALL

12:22.200 --> 12:23.333
FEELINGS, IS SWALLOWED UP BY THE

12:23.400 --> 12:24.633
UNFATHOMABLE VOID THAT YAWNS

12:24.700 --> 12:27.133
WITHIN HIM ALWAYS, THEN YEAH, IT

12:27.200 --> 12:28.567
WAS A VERY NICE QUESTION.

12:28.633 --> 12:29.867
VERY NICE INDEED.

12:29.934 --> 12:30.867
AND OAN HAS A LOT OF NICE

12:30.934 --> 12:32.300
QUESTIONS FOR THE PRESIDENT.

12:32.367 --> 12:34.066
WHEN HE WAS CRITICIZED FOR

12:34.133 --> 12:36.200
REFERRING TO THE CORONAVIRUS AS

12:36.266 --> 12:37.100
"THE CHINESE VIRUS," ONE OF

12:37.166 --> 12:38.633
THEIR CORRESPONDENTS RUSHED TO

12:38.700 --> 12:40.533
HIS DEFENSE WITH THIS BEAUTY:

12:40.600 --> 12:43.000
>> DO YOU CONSIDER THE TERM

12:43.066 --> 12:44.967
"CHINESE FOOD" RACIST BECAUSE

12:45.033 --> 12:46.967
IT'S FOOD THAT ORIGINATES IN

12:47.033 --> 12:47.700
CHINA OR IT HAS CHINESE ORIGINS?

12:47.767 --> 12:48.633
AND ON THAT NOTE --

12:48.700 --> 12:50.033
>> NO, I DON'T THINK IT'S

12:50.100 --> 12:50.266
RACIST.

12:50.333 --> 12:51.100
I DON'T THINK IT'S RACIST AT

12:51.166 --> 12:51.734
ALL.

12:51.800 --> 12:52.900
>> ON THAT NOTE, MAJOR LEFT-WING

12:52.967 --> 12:53.967
NEWS MEDIA, EVEN IN THIS ROOM,

12:54.033 --> 12:56.300
HAVE TEAMED UP WITH CHINESE

12:56.367 --> 12:57.967
COMMUNIST PARTY NARRATIVES, AND

12:58.033 --> 13:00.133
THEY'RE CLAIMING YOU'RE A RACIST

13:00.200 --> 13:01.300
FOR MAKING THESE CLAIMS ABOUT

13:01.367 --> 13:02.500
CHINESE VIRUS.

13:02.567 --> 13:06.934
IS IT ALARMING THAT MAJOR MEDIA

13:07.000 --> 13:07.767
PLAYERS JUST OPPOSE YOU, ARE

13:07.834 --> 13:08.900
CONSISTENTLY SIDING WITH FOREIGN

13:08.967 --> 13:09.533
STATE PROPAGANDA, ISLAMIC

13:09.600 --> 13:11.166
RADICALS, AND LATIN GANGS AND

13:11.233 --> 13:12.500
CARTELS, AND THEY WORK RIGHT

13:12.567 --> 13:13.400
HERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE WITH

13:13.467 --> 13:14.767
DIRECT ACCESS TO YOU AND YOUR

13:14.834 --> 13:16.000
TEAM?

13:16.066 --> 13:19.233
>> John: WOW.

13:19.300 --> 13:20.533
IT IS PRETTY WILD TO WATCH THE

13:20.600 --> 13:21.166
REACTIONS OF THE OTHER

13:21.233 --> 13:21.967
JOURNALISTS THERE WHO ARE

13:22.033 --> 13:23.166
CLEARLY NOT USED TO GETTING

13:23.233 --> 13:24.133
BULLSHIT FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE

13:24.200 --> 13:27.700
ROOM.

13:27.767 --> 13:29.266
THAT IS A LOOK THAT SAYS, "HOW

13:29.333 --> 13:30.633
DID I WIND UP IN THE MIDDLE OF

13:30.700 --> 13:32.400
THIS ASSHOLE SANDWICH?"

13:32.467 --> 13:33.767
AND IT'S MOMENTS LIKE THAT THAT

13:33.834 --> 13:35.000
EXPLAIN WHY TRUMP HAS SUCH A

13:35.066 --> 13:38.367
LOVE AFFAIR WITH OAN.

13:38.433 --> 13:39.734
HE HAS REPEATEDLY PRAISED THEM

13:39.800 --> 13:40.734
ON TWITTER.

13:40.800 --> 13:43.100
AT ONE POINT, WHEN HE DIDN'T

13:43.166 --> 13:43.700
LIKE SHEP SMITH'S COVERAGE OF

13:43.767 --> 13:44.967
HIS ADMINISTRATION, HE TWEETED

13:45.033 --> 13:45.900
THAT "SHEP SMITH HAS THE

13:45.967 --> 13:47.400
LOWEST-RATED SHOW ON FOX NEWS.

13:47.467 --> 13:49.333
ACTUALLY, WHENEVER POSSIBLE I

13:49.400 --> 13:51.533
TURN TO OAN."

13:51.600 --> 13:53.667
AND HIS FAMILY SEEM LIKE FANS,

13:53.734 --> 13:55.133
TOO -- JUST THIS THURSDAY, IN

13:55.200 --> 13:56.834
THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC, OAN

13:56.900 --> 13:58.567
SPENT NEARLY 15 MINUTES CHATTING

13:58.633 --> 13:59.600
WITH DON JR., RESULTING IN THIS

13:59.667 --> 14:01.667
FANTASTIC EXCHANGE.

14:01.734 --> 14:03.166
>> ARE YOU BINGE-WATCHING

14:03.233 --> 14:04.000
ANYTHING OVER THERE?

14:04.066 --> 14:05.200
YOU GOTTA BE BINGE-WATCHING

14:05.266 --> 14:06.633
SOMETHING.

14:06.700 --> 14:07.500
>> YEAH, WE BASICALLY WATCHED

14:07.567 --> 14:10.734
"TIGER KING" IN TWO SITTINGS.

14:10.800 --> 14:11.433
UH, SO IT'S SORT OF AMAZING, AND

14:11.500 --> 14:13.033
I'M JUST REALLY DISAPPOINTED

14:13.100 --> 14:13.667
THAT I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD GET

14:13.734 --> 14:15.100
A TIGER FOR TWO GRAND.

14:15.166 --> 14:16.633
I'M LIKE, YOU KNOW, IT'S A LOT

14:16.700 --> 14:17.500
OF MONEY, BUT, LIKE, IT'S A

14:17.567 --> 14:20.000
TIGER.

14:20.066 --> 14:21.000
YOU KNOW?

14:21.066 --> 14:23.567
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PRETTY

14:23.633 --> 14:24.867
COOL, TO HAVE HAD A TIGER

14:24.934 --> 14:25.533
HANGING AROUND THE HOUSE.

14:25.600 --> 14:26.300
>> John: WOW!

14:26.367 --> 14:27.667
THAT SHOULD ABSOLUTELY NOT BE

14:27.734 --> 14:29.066
YOUR TAKEAWAY AFTER WATCHING

14:29.133 --> 14:29.567
THAT SHOW.

14:29.633 --> 14:33.000
"TIGERS ARE SURPRISINGLY CHEAP.

14:33.066 --> 14:34.133
ALSO, IT TURNS OUT YOU CAN

14:34.200 --> 14:34.767
HIRE A HITMAN FOR $3000!

14:34.834 --> 14:36.300
WHAT A DEAL!"

14:36.367 --> 14:38.200
AND LOOK, OAN IS A RELATIVELY

14:38.266 --> 14:39.934
SMALL ORGANIZATION, BUT YOU MAY

14:40.000 --> 14:41.400
WELL KNOW SOMEONE WHO WATCHES

14:41.467 --> 14:43.400
THEM, AND THEY'RE PUNCHING WAY

14:43.467 --> 14:45.767
ABOVE THEIR WEIGHT RIGHT NOW.

14:45.834 --> 14:47.467
AND IF THEY'RE IN THE

14:47.533 --> 14:49.200
WHITE HOUSE PRESS ROOM BEING

14:49.266 --> 14:50.700
CALLED ON ALL THE TIME AND ARE

14:50.767 --> 14:51.967
MORE SUPPORTIVE OF THE PRESIDENT

14:52.033 --> 14:53.800
THAN FOX, WE THOUGHT TONIGHT IT

14:53.867 --> 14:54.934
MAY BE WORTH TAKING A LOOK AT

14:55.000 --> 14:57.967
WHO THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY DO.

14:58.033 --> 14:58.867
OAN IS THE BRAINCHILD OF

14:58.934 --> 14:59.867
ROBERT HERRING, CONSERVATIVE

14:59.934 --> 15:00.867
MILLIONAIRE AND SUN-DRIED

15:00.934 --> 15:02.667
JAKE GYLLENHAAL.

15:02.734 --> 15:03.934
AND SINCE ITS BIRTH, OAN HAS

15:04.000 --> 15:05.266
BEEN A HOME FOR EXTREME

15:05.333 --> 15:05.967
CONSERVATISM.

15:06.033 --> 15:07.133
HOW EXTREME?

15:07.200 --> 15:08.934
WELL, LET'S MEET THEIR HOSTS.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.834
FOR STARTERS, THERE'S

15:10.900 --> 15:12.333
GRAHAM LEDGER, WHO'S CALLED

15:12.400 --> 15:13.533
BLACK LIVES MATTER A CRIMINAL

15:13.600 --> 15:16.100
ORGANIZATION, CALLED BEING

15:16.166 --> 15:17.367
TRANSGENDER A "MENTAL PROBLEM,"

15:17.433 --> 15:19.133
AND SAID OF PEOPLE COMING TO THE

15:19.200 --> 15:20.633
U.S. FROM MAJORITY-MUSLIM

15:20.700 --> 15:22.367
COUNTRIES, "IF THEY WON'T TAKE A

15:22.433 --> 15:23.500
BITE OUT OF A PULLED PORK

15:23.567 --> 15:24.433
SANDWICH, WE PROBABLY WON'T LET

15:24.500 --> 15:26.633
THEM IN THE COUNTRY."

15:26.700 --> 15:28.100
AND IT'S WIT LIKE THAT THAT

15:28.166 --> 15:29.300
MAKES HIM THE NOEL COWARD OF

15:29.367 --> 15:30.266
MEAT SANDWICH-BASED

15:30.333 --> 15:32.567
RACE BAITING.

15:32.633 --> 15:36.800
HE STARTS EVERY SHOW WITH HIS

15:36.867 --> 15:38.467
SIGNATURE CATCHPHRASE,

15:38.533 --> 15:40.000
"THE DOORS TO THE NEWSROOM ARE

15:40.066 --> 15:41.166
LOCKED, AND THE PC POLICE ARE

15:41.233 --> 15:41.867
NOT GETTING IN,"

15:41.934 --> 15:42.433
AND IF THAT WASN'T SWEATY

15:42.500 --> 15:43.333
ENOUGH, HE ENDS EVERY SHOW LIKE

15:43.400 --> 15:43.834
THIS:

15:43.900 --> 15:44.567
>> THIS EDITION OF

15:44.633 --> 15:45.433
"THE DAILY LEDGER" IS ON ITS WAY

15:45.500 --> 15:46.000
TO THE ARCHIVES LIBRARY OF

15:46.066 --> 15:46.667
CONGRESS.

15:46.734 --> 15:47.400
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING.

15:47.467 --> 15:48.367
I'M GRAHAM LEDGER.

15:48.433 --> 15:49.700
AND REMEMBER, EVEN WHEN I'M

15:49.767 --> 15:51.533
WRONG, I'M RIGHT.

15:51.600 --> 15:53.266
>> John: YEAH.

15:53.333 --> 15:54.667
HE SIGNS OFF THAT WAY EVERY

15:54.734 --> 15:55.266
NIGHT.

15:55.333 --> 15:56.633
AND FOR THE RECORD, WE ACTUALLY

15:56.700 --> 15:58.100
ASKED THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS

15:58.166 --> 15:59.700
WHETHER "THE DAILY LEDGER" IS

15:59.767 --> 16:01.467
SENT TO ITS ARCHIVES, AND THEY

16:01.533 --> 16:03.066
TOLD US, AND I QUOTE,

16:03.133 --> 16:04.100
THEY "HAVE NO RECORD OF

16:04.166 --> 16:05.867
'THE DAILY LEDGER' BEING

16:05.934 --> 16:07.133
SUBMITTED, NOR HAVE WE RECEIVED

16:07.200 --> 16:08.367
THE SHOWS AS A COLLECTION."

16:08.433 --> 16:09.934
AND ANYWAY, GETTING INTO THE

16:10.000 --> 16:11.433
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS ISN'T

16:11.500 --> 16:12.433
REMOTELY IMPRESSIVE.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.667
YOU KNOW WHAT'S IN THERE?

16:14.734 --> 16:17.033
"JERSEY SHORE" IS IN THERE.

16:17.100 --> 16:19.000
"MILF CHRONICLES 4:

16:19.066 --> 16:21.800
BUSTY MANSIONS" IS IN THERE.

16:21.867 --> 16:25.033
EVEN OUR SHOW IS IN THERE.

16:25.100 --> 16:30.200
IT'S TRUE.

16:30.266 --> 16:32.367
THIS IS OUR LISTING IN THEIR

16:32.433 --> 16:32.600
CATALOG.

16:32.667 --> 16:33.934
WHAT I'M SAYING IS, YOU WOULDN'T

16:34.000 --> 16:34.567
BE KEEPING GREAT COMPANY, EVEN

16:34.633 --> 16:35.300
IF YOU WERE IN THERE, WHICH

16:35.367 --> 16:35.600
YOU'RE NOT.

16:35.667 --> 16:36.200
THEN, OF COURSE, THERE'S HIS

16:36.266 --> 16:36.867
CATCHPHRASE: "EVEN WHEN I'M

16:36.934 --> 16:37.533
WRONG, I'M RIGHT."

16:37.600 --> 16:38.367
WHICH IS EVEN STUPIDER.

16:38.433 --> 16:39.266
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO SAY

16:39.333 --> 16:40.567
SOMETHING THAT IMPLIES THAT

16:40.633 --> 16:43.433
YOU'RE BOTH SHAMELESSLY PARTISAN

16:43.500 --> 16:44.600
AND WRONG A NOT-INSIGNIFICANT

16:44.667 --> 16:46.133
PART OF THE TIME?

16:46.233 --> 16:50.400
IT'D MAKE JUST AS MUCH SENSE IF

16:50.467 --> 16:52.867
HIS CATCHPHRASE WAS "REMEMBER,

16:52.900 --> 16:53.800
EVEN AFTER I HAVE

16:53.867 --> 16:54.367
EXPLOSIVE DIARRHEA,

16:54.433 --> 16:55.500
I'M STILL FULL OF SHIT."

16:55.567 --> 16:56.400
WHY WOULD YOU ADMIT EITHER OF

16:56.467 --> 16:58.100
THOSE THINGS?

16:58.166 --> 16:59.166
BUT IT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE GOOD

16:59.233 --> 17:01.033
THAT LEDGER SPECIFIES HIS

17:01.100 --> 17:02.467
RIGHTNESS-EVEN-IN-WRONGNESS,

17:02.533 --> 17:04.100
BECAUSE HE IS WRONG A LOT, AND

17:04.166 --> 17:05.166
ALWAYS WITH A CERTAIN

17:05.233 --> 17:07.633
RON BURGUNDY FLAIR.

17:07.700 --> 17:09.633
WATCH AS HE TRIES TO DISMANTLE

17:09.700 --> 17:11.567
BERNIE SANDERS' RHETORIC:

17:11.633 --> 17:13.934
>> UNFETTERED CAPITALISM IS WHAT

17:14.000 --> 17:14.967
WE SHOULD DESIRE IN THIS

17:15.033 --> 17:16.867
COUNTRY.

17:16.934 --> 17:19.767
UNFETTERED CAPITALISM IS WHAT

17:19.834 --> 17:21.400
MADE THIS COUNTRY GREAT IN THE

17:21.467 --> 17:28.166
INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION.

17:28.233 --> 17:29.500
CARNEGIE AND, UM, THE OTHER MEN

17:29.567 --> 17:30.967
THAT -- THAT BUILT THIS COUNTRY

17:31.033 --> 17:31.533
IN THE LATE 1800s.

17:31.600 --> 17:32.900
I'M BLANKING.

17:32.967 --> 17:35.100
J.P. MORGAN!

17:35.166 --> 17:35.900
UH, THE REST OF THEM.

17:35.967 --> 17:37.667
ROCKEFELLER!

17:37.734 --> 17:40.333
THERE'S A NAME.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.700
>> John: YEAH, THERE IS A NAME.

17:42.767 --> 17:43.433
NICE SAVE, GRAHAM.

17:43.500 --> 17:44.900
AND THAT'S THE KIND OF ERUDITE

17:44.967 --> 17:46.633
HISTORICAL INSIGHT YOU CAN

17:46.700 --> 17:47.767
FIND IN HIS BOOK,

17:47.834 --> 17:49.533
"THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION:

17:49.600 --> 17:50.900
HOW ANDREW CARNEGIE AND, UH,

17:50.967 --> 17:51.500
YOU KNOW, THE REST OF THEM...

17:51.567 --> 17:52.700
J.P. MORGAN AND...

17:52.767 --> 17:53.567
OTHERS --

17:53.633 --> 17:54.667
THE MONOPOLY MAN, MAYBE?

17:54.734 --> 17:55.200
THAT'S A NAME --

17:55.266 --> 17:55.834
BUILT AMERICA THROUGH

17:55.900 --> 17:58.000
UNFETTERED CAPITALISM.

17:58.066 --> 17:59.266
OH, SHIT, AND HENRY FORD!"

17:59.333 --> 18:00.033
BUT LEDGER ISN'T THE NETWORK'S

18:00.100 --> 18:01.734
ONLY BRIGHT LIGHT.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.300
YOU ALREADY KNOW CHANEL RION,

18:03.367 --> 18:05.600
OAN'S WHITE HOUSE REPORTER,

18:05.667 --> 18:06.767
WHOSE SPECIALTY SEEMS TO BE

18:06.834 --> 18:08.467
ASKING THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE ON

18:08.533 --> 18:12.400
ABSOLUTELY NOBODY'S MINDS.

18:12.467 --> 18:13.900
>> 2,405 AMERICANS HAVE DIED

18:13.967 --> 18:15.266
FROM CORONAVIRUS IN THE LAST 60

18:15.333 --> 18:16.000
DAYS.

18:16.066 --> 18:18.767
>> YEAH.

18:18.834 --> 18:20.066
>> MEANWHILE, YOU HAVE 2,369

18:20.133 --> 18:21.700
CHILDREN WHO ARE KILLED BY THEIR

18:21.767 --> 18:23.000
MOTHERS THROUGH ELECTIVE

18:23.066 --> 18:24.633
ABORTIONS EACH DAY.

18:24.700 --> 18:26.333
THAT'S 16,500 CHILDREN KILLED

18:26.400 --> 18:27.734
EVERY WEEK.

18:27.800 --> 18:30.066
>> YEAH.

18:30.133 --> 18:31.200
>> John: OKAY, THAT'S OBVIOUSLY

18:31.266 --> 18:33.133
A RHETORICAL BAD FAITH ARGUMENT,

18:33.200 --> 18:35.233
BUT WHAT THE HELL, LET'S ENGAGE.

18:35.300 --> 18:35.900
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF ABORTIONS

18:35.967 --> 18:37.233
AND THOUSANDS OF CORONAVIRUS

18:37.300 --> 18:39.667
DEATHS.

18:39.734 --> 18:40.700
THAT'S TRUE.

18:40.767 --> 18:41.834
WE CAN DISAGREE ON WHETHER THOSE

18:41.900 --> 18:42.734
THINGS ARE EQUIVALENT --

18:42.800 --> 18:44.367
THEY'RE NOT -- BUT IF ONLY ONE

18:44.433 --> 18:46.300
OF THEM IS GROWING EXPONENTIALLY

18:46.367 --> 18:47.333
EVERY SINGLE DAY, THAT SHOULD

18:47.400 --> 18:49.133
PROBABLY BE THE ONE WE FOCUS ON

18:49.200 --> 18:51.233
RIGHT THE FUCK NOW.

18:51.300 --> 18:52.633
BUT BY ALL MEANS, COME BACK TO

18:52.700 --> 18:54.133
THAT QUESTION ONCE ABORTIONS

18:54.200 --> 18:54.867
BECOME INVOLUNTARY AND WILDLY

18:54.934 --> 18:58.333
CONTAGIOUS.

18:58.400 --> 18:59.967
NOW, WHEN CHANEL RION ISN'T

19:00.033 --> 19:01.500
ASKING NICE QUESTIONS IN THE

19:01.567 --> 19:02.867
WHITE HOUSE PRESS ROOM, SHE ALSO

19:02.934 --> 19:04.500
CLAIMS TO BE THE "BEST POLITICAL

19:04.567 --> 19:06.467
ILLUSTRATOR IN THE COUNTRY FOR

19:06.533 --> 19:08.800
CONSTITUTIONAL CONSERVATIVE AND

19:08.867 --> 19:09.900
ANTI-LEFTIST CAUSES" WHICH, TO

19:09.967 --> 19:12.467
BE FAIR, IS A VERY LOW BAR TO

19:12.533 --> 19:14.367
CLEAR, YET I'M NOT SURE IF THIS

19:14.433 --> 19:16.900
DRAWING OF RACHEL MADDOW AS

19:16.967 --> 19:18.967
"WRETCHED MADCOW" EVEN MANAGES

19:19.033 --> 19:21.734
TO GET OVER IT.

19:21.800 --> 19:25.033
SHE ALSO RUNS A WORD OF THE DAY

19:25.100 --> 19:25.633
WEBSITE CALLED "WORDEBY'S:

19:25.700 --> 19:26.967
A WORLD OF FINE WORDS,"

19:27.033 --> 19:27.934
FEATURING ARTFUL TRIBUTES TO

19:28.000 --> 19:30.100
FLORAL LANGUAGE LIKE

19:30.166 --> 19:32.066
"METANOIA," "ORPHIC," AND

19:32.133 --> 19:33.400
"BACKPFEIFENGESICHT," WHICH

19:33.467 --> 19:34.934
APPARENTLY MEANS "A FACE BADLY

19:35.000 --> 19:40.633
IN NEED OF A PUNCHING."

19:40.700 --> 19:42.033
HER ABOUT PAGE EXPLAINS THAT

19:42.100 --> 19:42.633
"IF WE DON'T NURTURE AND GROW

19:42.700 --> 19:43.633
OUR WORD REALMS, WE DON'T

19:43.700 --> 19:44.767
NURTURE AND GROW OUR THOUGHT

19:44.834 --> 19:45.834
REALMS."

19:45.900 --> 19:46.934
AND IT'S HARD TO KNOW HOW TO

19:47.000 --> 19:48.266
DESCRIBE A SENTENCE LIKE THAT.

19:48.333 --> 19:50.600
THANKFULLY, WORDEBY'S HAS AN

19:50.667 --> 19:51.767
ENTRY ON "FANFARONADE," WHICH

19:51.834 --> 19:53.033
MEANS "EMPTY SELF-PROMOTING

19:53.100 --> 19:53.533
LANGUAGE."

19:53.600 --> 19:54.667
AND THAT SEEMS TO HIT THE NAIL

19:54.734 --> 19:55.867
RIGHT ON THE HEAD.

19:55.934 --> 20:00.000
THIS WEBSITE IS SO HANDY!

20:00.066 --> 20:01.266
THEN THERE IS LIZ WHEELER, WHO'S

20:01.333 --> 20:01.734
A BIG TRUMP FAVORITE.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.133
AND SHE CAN DEVELOP AN ARGUMENT.

20:04.200 --> 20:06.000
JUST WATCH AS, OVER THE COURSE

20:06.066 --> 20:07.266
OF 54 SECONDS, SHE SPINS AN

20:07.333 --> 20:09.367
AQUARIUM'S SIMPLE DECISION NOT

20:09.433 --> 20:10.734
TO ANNOUNCE THE GENDER OF

20:10.800 --> 20:11.767
A BABY PENGUIN INTO SOMETHING

20:11.834 --> 20:15.200
VERY DIFFERENT.

20:15.266 --> 20:17.367
>> WE SHOULD ASK: WHERE DOES

20:17.433 --> 20:19.233
RADICAL LEFTIST GENDER IDEOLOGY

20:19.300 --> 20:20.300
LEAD?

20:20.367 --> 20:21.734
DO LIBERALS WANT HUMAN CHILDREN

20:21.800 --> 20:23.200
TO BE GENDERLESS?

20:23.266 --> 20:25.033
IF SO, WHY?

20:25.100 --> 20:27.700
IS THIS BASED ON BIOLOGY?

20:27.767 --> 20:29.800
AND IF NOT, THEN WHAT?

20:29.867 --> 20:31.500
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN HUMAN CHILDREN

20:31.567 --> 20:33.633
ARE RAISED GENDERLESS?

20:33.700 --> 20:36.600
IF GENDER IS DESTROYED, DOESN'T

20:36.667 --> 20:37.800
THAT DESTROY TRADITIONAL

20:37.867 --> 20:39.166
GENDER ROLES?

20:39.233 --> 20:40.333
AND IF GENDER ROLES ARE

20:40.400 --> 20:41.934
DESTROYED, DOESN'T THAT DESTROY

20:42.000 --> 20:44.867
GENDERED RELATIONSHIPS?

20:44.934 --> 20:46.867
AND IF GENDERED RELATIONSHIPS

20:46.934 --> 20:47.834
ARE DESTROYED, DOESN'T THAT

20:47.900 --> 20:49.600
DESTROY TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE?

20:49.667 --> 20:51.600
AND IF TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE IS

20:51.667 --> 20:52.834
DESTROYED, DOESN'T THAT DESTROY

20:52.900 --> 20:54.967
THE FAMILY UNIT?

20:55.033 --> 20:56.367
AND IF PEOPLE AREN'T DEPENDENT

20:56.433 --> 20:57.934
ON THEIR FAMILIES, THEN WHO DO

20:58.000 --> 21:03.800
THEY DEPEND ON?

21:03.867 --> 21:04.934
THAT'S RIGHT, THE GOVERNMENT,

21:05.000 --> 21:05.600
WHICH IS THE GOAL OF LIBERALS IN

21:05.667 --> 21:06.467
THE FIRST PLACE.

21:06.533 --> 21:07.433
DON'T LET TRANSGENDER PENGUINS

21:07.500 --> 21:08.300
FOOL YOU.

21:08.367 --> 21:10.934
>> John: WOW.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.233
THAT ARGUMENT IS A WALK.

21:14.300 --> 21:15.433
I ASSUME THAT SHE USES THAT SAME

21:15.500 --> 21:15.934
CHAIN ARGUMENT LOGIC FOR

21:16.000 --> 21:16.900
EVERYTHING.

21:16.967 --> 21:18.800
"ASK YOURSELF THIS: WHY DO

21:18.867 --> 21:19.800
RADICAL LEFTISTS WANT TO EXPAND

21:19.867 --> 21:21.133
HEALTH INSURANCE?

21:21.200 --> 21:22.834
DO LIBERALS WANT EVERYONE TO

21:22.900 --> 21:24.533
HAVE HEALTH?

21:24.600 --> 21:27.100
AND IF EVERYONE HAS HEALTH, DOES

21:27.166 --> 21:28.533
THAT MEAN NO ONE WILL EVER DIE?

21:28.600 --> 21:29.967
AND IF NO ONE EVER DIES, DOESN'T

21:30.033 --> 21:30.900
THAT MEAN HITLER WOULD STILL BE

21:30.967 --> 21:31.333
ALIVE?

21:31.400 --> 21:32.467
AND IF HITLER IS STILL ALIVE,

21:32.533 --> 21:33.100
ISN'T WORLD WAR II STILL

21:33.166 --> 21:34.433
HAPPENING?

21:34.500 --> 21:35.600
AND IF WORLD WAR II IS STILL

21:35.667 --> 21:36.667
HAPPENING, DOESN'T THAT MEAN OUR

21:36.734 --> 21:38.600
TROOPS ARE STILL FIGHTING?

21:38.667 --> 21:40.200
AND IF OUR TROOPS ARE STILL BUSY

21:40.266 --> 21:41.767
FIGHTING IN WORLD WAR II, WHO IS

21:41.800 --> 21:43.133
DEFENDING AMERICA FROM

21:43.200 --> 21:43.734
TERRORISTS?

21:43.767 --> 21:44.767
THAT'S RIGHT: NO ONE, WHICH IS

21:44.867 --> 21:46.233
THE GOAL OF LIBERALS IN THE

21:46.300 --> 21:47.500
FIRST PLACE.

21:47.567 --> 21:48.767
DON'T LET POLYAMOROUS LOBSTERS

21:48.834 --> 21:52.200
FOOL YOU."

21:52.266 --> 21:54.800
AND, LOOK, IT'S NOT JUST

21:54.867 --> 21:55.867
HARD-RIGHT TALKING POINTS --

21:55.934 --> 21:57.266
THE NETWORK HAS ACTIVELY GIVEN

21:57.333 --> 21:58.300
AIRTIME TO CONSPIRACY THEORIES.

21:58.367 --> 22:00.400
THEY PUT UP A $100,000 REWARD

22:00.467 --> 22:01.633
FOR INFORMATION ON SETH RICH'S

22:01.700 --> 22:03.400
MURDER, LAST YEAR THEY TRAVELED

22:03.467 --> 22:06.166
WITH RUDY GIULIANI TO UKRAINE TO

22:06.233 --> 22:07.400
SHOOT A MULTI-PART SERIES

22:07.467 --> 22:09.667
FEATURING HIS INVESTIGATIONS

22:09.734 --> 22:11.667
THERE, AND JUST RECENTLY,

22:11.734 --> 22:13.500
CHANEL RION HOSTED A SPECIAL IN

22:13.567 --> 22:15.400
WHICH SHE BOOSTED A CONSPIRACY

22:15.467 --> 22:17.500
THEORY THE CORONAVIRUS MIGHT

22:17.567 --> 22:19.000
HAVE ORIGINATED AS A BIOWEAPON

22:19.066 --> 22:21.066
IN A NORTH CAROLINA LABORATORY.

22:21.133 --> 22:23.433
THE WHOLE SELLING POINT FOR OAN

22:23.500 --> 22:25.200
IS THAT THEY'RE FOX NEWS WITH

22:25.266 --> 22:27.300
EVEN LESS SHAME AND EVEN FEWER

22:27.367 --> 22:29.166
SCRUPLES.

22:29.233 --> 22:30.967
IN FACT, THEY'RE SO FLAGRANTLY

22:31.033 --> 22:32.433
SMITTEN WITH TRUMP THAT AT ONE

22:32.500 --> 22:33.934
POINT, THEIR NETWORK ACCOUNT

22:34.000 --> 22:35.533
ACTUALLY TWEETED,

22:35.600 --> 22:36.800
"PRESIDENT TRUMP RECENTLY GAVE A

22:36.867 --> 22:37.600
SPEECH THANKING HIS SUPPORTERS

22:37.667 --> 22:38.867
IN THE MEDIA.

22:38.934 --> 22:40.567
NOT A SINGLE MENTION OF

22:40.633 --> 22:41.867
ONE AMERICA NEWS --

22:41.934 --> 22:43.734
ONE OF HIS GREATEST SUPPORTERS.

22:43.800 --> 22:46.600
OAN CALLS BULLSHIT."

22:46.667 --> 22:48.033
AND THAT IS JUST PATHETICALLY

22:48.100 --> 22:49.767
THIRSTY.

22:49.834 --> 22:51.667
THEY SHIFT FROM FAWNING PRAISE

22:51.734 --> 22:53.200
TO SULLEN FURY IF PEOPLE STOP

22:53.266 --> 22:54.700
COMPLIMENTING THEM FOR A SINGLE

22:54.767 --> 22:55.800
SECOND.

22:55.867 --> 22:56.767
ALTHOUGH, WHEN YOU PUT IT LIKE

22:56.834 --> 22:57.700
THAT, YOU DO KIND OF GET WHAT

22:57.767 --> 22:58.800
OAN AND THE PRESIDENT SEE IN

22:58.867 --> 23:01.633
EACH OTHER.

23:01.700 --> 23:03.700
AND I KNOW THAT IT'S EASY TO

23:03.767 --> 23:05.867
DISMISS OAN AS JUST A STUPID,

23:05.934 --> 23:07.066
LITTLE-WATCHED, BORDERLINE

23:07.133 --> 23:08.600
SELF-PARODY.

23:08.667 --> 23:10.467
THE PROBLEM IS, IF WE'RE

23:10.533 --> 23:12.233
LEARNING ONE THING RIGHT NOW,

23:12.300 --> 23:13.533
IT'S THAT TOXIC THINGS THAT

23:13.600 --> 23:15.467
START SMALL CAN GET BIG FAST,

23:15.533 --> 23:16.266
AND IT'S DANGEROUS TO IGNORE

23:16.333 --> 23:17.767
THEM.

23:17.834 --> 23:19.533
AND RIGHT NOW, THE PRESIDENT'S

23:19.600 --> 23:20.400
PUTTING A LOT OF ENERGY INTO

23:20.467 --> 23:23.300
BOOSTING OAN'S PROFILE.

23:23.367 --> 23:24.767
FOR INSTANCE, LAST WEEK, EVEN AS

23:24.834 --> 23:26.867
THE NUMBER OF CONFIRMED

23:26.934 --> 23:28.800
CORONAVIRUS CASES IN THE U.S.

23:28.867 --> 23:31.300
PASSED 65,000, TRUMP THOUGHT IT

23:31.367 --> 23:32.934
WAS IMPORTANT THAT HIS TWITTER

23:33.000 --> 23:36.433
FOLLOWERS SEE THIS VIDEO:

23:36.500 --> 23:39.000
>> GUESS WHAT?

23:39.066 --> 23:40.934
THANKS TO YOU GUYS, THIS BOOK,

23:41.000 --> 23:42.367
MY BOOK, IS NUMBER FOUR ON

23:42.433 --> 23:44.133
AMAZON'S BESTSELLER LIST IN THE

23:44.200 --> 23:46.367
POLITICAL COMMENTARY CATEGORY.

23:46.433 --> 23:48.066
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU

23:48.133 --> 23:49.633
SO MUCH.

23:49.700 --> 23:51.166
>> John: YEAH.

23:51.233 --> 23:52.100
HE RETWEETED THAT WITH THE NOTE,

23:52.166 --> 23:53.500
"BUY THE BOOK AND GIVE LIZ SOME

23:53.567 --> 23:56.033
GREAT REVIEWS."

23:56.100 --> 23:57.667
WHICH WOULD ABSOLUTELY BE WEIRD

23:57.734 --> 23:58.667
ENOUGH EVEN IF LIZ WHEELER

23:58.734 --> 24:00.233
HADN'T POSTED THAT VIDEO LAST

24:00.300 --> 24:02.333
AUGUST.

24:02.400 --> 24:04.133
AND WE ALL KNOW THE RULES:

24:04.200 --> 24:05.834
LIKING SOMEONE'S POST IS FINE.

24:05.900 --> 24:07.567
LIKING SOMEONE'S POST FROM

24:07.633 --> 24:08.967
SEVEN MONTHS AGO IS THE

24:09.033 --> 24:15.033
CREEPIEST THING ON EARTH.

24:15.100 --> 24:15.667
AND TRUMP HAS HAD THEIR BACK IN

24:15.734 --> 24:16.400
OTHER WAYS.

24:16.467 --> 24:17.533
JUST THIS WEEK, THE WHITE HOUSE

24:17.600 --> 24:18.100
CORRESPONDENTS' ASSOCIATION

24:18.166 --> 24:18.967
ACTUALLY REVOKED OAN'S ACCESS TO

24:19.033 --> 24:20.133
A SEAT IN THE BRIEFINGS.

24:20.200 --> 24:21.633
THE REASON THEY DID THIS WAS

24:21.700 --> 24:23.367
BECAUSE MOST REPORTERS HAD

24:23.433 --> 24:24.767
AGREED TO TAKE TURNS ATTENDING

24:24.834 --> 24:26.400
TO KEEP THE ROOM EMPTIER AND

24:26.467 --> 24:28.400
FOLLOW SOCIAL DISTANCING RULES.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.133
BUT CHANEL RION REPEATEDLY

24:30.200 --> 24:31.166
SHOWED UP ON DAYS SHE WASN'T

24:31.233 --> 24:33.000
ASSIGNED A SEAT.

24:33.066 --> 24:35.200
YET DESPITE HAVING HER SEAT

24:35.266 --> 24:36.600
REVOKED ON WEDNESDAY, RION WAS

24:36.667 --> 24:38.166
BACK IN THAT ROOM THE VERY NEXT

24:38.233 --> 24:40.233
DAY, TELLING PEOPLE SHE'D BEEN

24:40.300 --> 24:42.100
PERSONALLY INVITED AS A GUEST OF

24:42.166 --> 24:42.867
THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY.

24:42.934 --> 24:45.967
AND THAT'S A PROBLEM.

24:46.033 --> 24:47.834
BECAUSE IN THE BEST OF TIMES,

24:47.900 --> 24:50.000
YOU CAN LAUGH AT AN ALMOST

24:50.066 --> 24:51.000
"ANCHORMAN"-ESQUE PARODY OF

24:51.066 --> 24:53.066
RIGHT-WING NEWS.

24:53.133 --> 24:55.300
BUT MUCH LIKE THE PROBLEM WITH

24:55.367 --> 24:56.266
"ANCHORMAN 2," IT'S JUST NOT THE

24:56.333 --> 24:57.900
RIGHT TIME FOR RON BURGUNDY

24:57.967 --> 24:59.367
RIGHT NOW.

24:59.433 --> 25:02.633
OAN'S WEIRD COMBINATION OF

25:02.700 --> 25:03.433
FAR-RIGHT WING TALKING POINTS

25:03.500 --> 25:04.433
AND DIRT-STUPID REPORTING IS

25:04.500 --> 25:05.900
INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS AT A TIME

25:05.967 --> 25:07.433
LIKE THIS.

25:07.500 --> 25:09.567
GRAHAM LEDGER HAS EXPLICITLY

25:09.633 --> 25:11.533
CALLED FOR AMERICANS TO DEFY THE

25:11.600 --> 25:13.000
GOVERNMENT'S ADVICE ON SOCIAL

25:13.066 --> 25:14.967
DISTANCING AND JUSTIFIED HIS

25:15.033 --> 25:17.000
ARGUMENT LIKE THIS:

25:17.066 --> 25:18.900
>> I WOULD RATHER DIE OF

25:18.967 --> 25:20.500
CORONAVIRUS A FREE PERSON THAN

25:20.567 --> 25:23.033
LIVE LIKE A SLAVE TO GOVERNMENT,

25:23.100 --> 25:24.100
ENGULFED IN FEAR, PANIC, AND

25:24.166 --> 25:28.266
WITH NO LIBERTY.

25:28.333 --> 25:29.533
THIS EDITION OF

25:29.600 --> 25:30.800
"THE DAILY LEDGER" IS ON ITS WAY

25:30.867 --> 25:31.633
TO THE ARCHIVES LIBRARY OF

25:31.700 --> 25:32.533
CONGRESS.

25:32.600 --> 25:33.533
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING.

25:33.600 --> 25:34.333
I'M GRAHAM LEDGER.

25:34.400 --> 25:35.700
AND REMEMBER, EVEN WHEN I'M

25:35.767 --> 25:37.633
WRONG, I'M RIGHT.

25:37.700 --> 25:39.433
>> John: HONESTLY, AS

25:39.500 --> 25:40.834
MONUMENTALLY DUMB AS THAT

25:40.900 --> 25:42.967
CATCHPHRASE IS, IT STILL MIGHT

25:43.033 --> 25:44.166
BE TOO SMART FOR GRAHAM LEDGER.

25:44.233 --> 25:45.600
HE DESERVES A CATCHPHRASE MORE

25:45.667 --> 25:47.533
ON HIS INTELLECTUAL LEVEL.

25:47.600 --> 25:48.500
MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE,

25:48.567 --> 25:49.500
"I'M GRAHAM LEDGER, AND

25:49.567 --> 25:50.367
REMEMBER, ANYTHING CAN BE FOOD

25:50.433 --> 25:52.500
IF YOU EAT IT."

25:52.567 --> 25:54.100
AND INCIDENTALLY, THAT'S

25:54.166 --> 25:55.533
JUST THE TAME TV VERSION OF

25:55.600 --> 25:57.000
GRAHAM LEDGER.

25:57.066 --> 25:58.633
ONLINE HE'S EVEN WORSE.

25:58.700 --> 26:00.700
JUST WATCH A VIDEO HE POSTED ON

26:00.767 --> 26:02.767
TUESDAY OF THIS WEEK IN WHICH HE

26:02.834 --> 26:04.400
CLAIMED IT WAS IMPORTANT HE GET

26:04.467 --> 26:06.000
HIS HAIR CUT AND FRAMED IT AS A

26:06.066 --> 26:10.667
BRAVE ACT OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE.

26:10.734 --> 26:11.767
>> YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TO DO

26:11.834 --> 26:13.033
BECAUSE WE'RE LIVING UNDER AN

26:13.100 --> 26:14.333
EDICT NOT UNLIKE HITLER'S

26:14.400 --> 26:15.867
GERMANY OR JOSEF STALIN IN THE

26:15.934 --> 26:17.800
SOVIET UNION, WE'RE LIVING UNDER

26:17.867 --> 26:20.700
TYRANNY INSTEAD OF LIBERTY?

26:20.767 --> 26:22.767
WELL, WE HAVE TO DO THIS IN

26:22.800 --> 26:26.767
CLANDESTINE STYLE.

26:26.834 --> 26:28.767
MY HAIRDRESSER COULD BE FINED

26:28.800 --> 26:29.600
AND/OR ARRESTED FOR WHAT SHE'S

26:29.700 --> 26:31.633
DOING.

26:31.700 --> 26:33.633
THIS IS NOT UNLIKE, OF COURSE,

26:33.700 --> 26:35.033
WHAT THEY HAD TO LIVE THROUGH

26:35.100 --> 26:37.200
DURING HITLER'S TIME.

26:37.266 --> 26:37.967
>> John: OKAY, A COUPLE THINGS

26:38.066 --> 26:39.066
THERE.

26:39.133 --> 26:40.166
FIRST OF ALL, IT'S NOT ESSENTIAL

26:40.233 --> 26:41.533
THAT YOU GET YOUR HAIR CUT.

26:41.600 --> 26:42.567
PEOPLE ON TV DON'T ALWAYS LOOK

26:42.633 --> 26:43.367
WELL-GROOMED.

26:43.433 --> 26:44.567
TRUST ME.

26:44.633 --> 26:46.033
TRUST ME.

26:46.100 --> 26:47.166
HEY, LOOK AT ME --

26:47.233 --> 26:49.100
TRUST ME.

26:49.166 --> 26:50.333
SECOND, HITLER DIDN'T OUTLAW

26:50.400 --> 26:51.367
HAIRCUTS.

26:51.433 --> 26:52.967
HE WAS A FASCIST ABOUT PERSONAL

26:53.033 --> 26:54.000
GROOMING.

26:54.066 --> 26:54.967
OTHER STUFF TOO, BUT MAINLY

26:55.033 --> 26:59.533
THAT.

26:59.600 --> 27:00.433
AND THIRD, IF WE WERE LIVING

27:00.500 --> 27:01.667
UNDER A NAZI OCCUPATION, MAYBE

27:01.734 --> 27:02.300
DON'T FILM YOURSELF EN ROUTE TO

27:02.367 --> 27:03.133
YOUR SECRET UNDERGROUND

27:03.200 --> 27:04.900
RESISTANCE SALON, WHICH --

27:04.967 --> 27:06.533
IT TOOK LITERALLY FIVE MINUTES

27:06.600 --> 27:07.867
ON GOOGLE TO FIGURE OUT -- IS

27:07.934 --> 27:09.133
PRESUMABLY SOMEWHERE AROUND THE

27:09.200 --> 27:10.300
MOONLIGHT PLAZA SHOPPING CENTER

27:10.367 --> 27:13.467
IN ENCINITAS, CALIFORNIA.

27:13.533 --> 27:15.200
AND LOOK, THE PROBLEM HERE IS,

27:15.266 --> 27:16.500
THE KIND OF MISINFORMATION OAN

27:16.567 --> 27:18.133
IS SPEWING RIGHT NOW COULD END

27:18.200 --> 27:20.066
UP GETTING PEOPLE KILLED.

27:20.133 --> 27:21.767
AND SADLY, THEIR MESSAGE IS

27:21.834 --> 27:22.734
BEING ACTIVELY SPREAD BY THE

27:22.800 --> 27:26.734
WHITE HOUSE.

27:26.800 --> 27:28.066
SO IT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN

27:28.133 --> 27:29.333
EVER TO BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR

27:29.400 --> 27:30.667
OAN'S BULLSHIT AND TO MAKE SURE

27:30.734 --> 27:31.934
NO ONE YOU KNOW IS FALLING FOR

27:32.000 --> 27:33.166
IT EITHER.

27:33.233 --> 27:35.233
AND I KNOW THAT JUST CALLING IT

27:35.300 --> 27:37.266
"BULLSHIT" MAY SEEM CRUDE, SO

27:37.333 --> 27:39.300
FOR ALL OF THOSE WHO MIGHT

27:39.367 --> 27:41.266
DESIRE A MORE ELOQUENT PLEA,

27:41.333 --> 27:43.266
LET ME OFFER SOME LANGUAGE FROM

27:43.333 --> 27:44.800
CHANEL RION'S WEBSITE,

27:44.867 --> 27:48.900
WORDEBY'S.

27:49.900 --> 27:50.800
IN THIS VESPERTINE HOUR,

27:50.867 --> 27:51.633
I IMPLORE YOU TO IGNORE

27:51.700 --> 27:52.967
A NEWS NETWORK THAT ATTEMPTS TO

27:53.033 --> 27:54.066
GLOZE THIS ADMINISTRATION'S

27:54.133 --> 27:55.834
INEPTITUDE DURING A PANDEMIC,

27:55.900 --> 27:58.000
WHETHER IT BE A SCIOLIST LIKE

27:58.066 --> 27:59.800
LIZ WHEELER, A BACKFEIFENGESICHT

27:59.867 --> 28:01.133
LIKE GRAHAM LEDGER, OR A

28:01.200 --> 28:05.700
RAKEFIRE LIKE CHANEL RION.

28:05.767 --> 28:09.834
FOR THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT JUST

28:09.900 --> 28:11.033
IRRESPONSIBLE, MY FRIENDS,

28:11.100 --> 28:11.867
THEY'RE A BUNCH OF FUCKING

28:11.934 --> 28:12.300
FOPDOODLES.

28:12.367 --> 28:13.233
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

28:13.300 --> 28:13.867
THANKS SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

28:13.934 --> 28:15.166
WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

28:15.233 --> 28:15.900
I'M JOHN OLIVER, AND THIS

28:15.967 --> 28:16.967
EDITION OF "LAST WEEK TONIGHT"

28:17.033 --> 28:17.767
IS, FOR SOME REASON, ACTUALLY ON

28:17.834 --> 28:19.266
ITS WAY TO THE LIBRARY OF

28:19.333 --> 28:19.934
CONGRESS.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.133
DON'T LET BI-CURIOUS MANATEES

28:22.200 --> 28:27.433
FOOL YOU.

28:32.400 --> 28:32.767
OKAY.

28:32.834 --> 28:35.800
AND THAT FEELS LIKE A SHOW.
