(Mindy)
OH, MY GOD!

00:02.936 --> 00:05.473
DANNY, SHE GONE,
AND I THINK BEN AFFLECK DID IT.

00:05.506 --> 00:08.276
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
SCOOCH OVER.

00:08.309 --> 00:10.778
OH, I THOUGHT TONIGHT I WOULD
SLEEP ON THIS SIDE OF THE BED.

00:10.811 --> 00:12.246
WHAT? NO, SINCE I WAS A KID,

00:12.280 --> 00:14.148
I ALWAYS SLEEP
ON THE RIGHT SIDE.

00:14.182 --> 00:16.350
IT WENT RICHIE, MA, ME.

00:16.384 --> 00:18.652
WELL, AT MY HOME, THIS SIDE
IS ACTUALLY MY SIDE OF THE BED.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.321
YOU CAN TELL BECAUSE
OF THE ENORMOUS BREAST DENTS

00:20.354 --> 00:21.489
IN THE MATTRESS.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.324
BUT, BECAUSE WE NEVER SPEND
THE NIGHT THERE,

00:23.357 --> 00:24.325
I NEVER GET TO SLEEP IN IT.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.194
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
JUST TURN ON MY NOISE MACHINE.

00:26.227 --> 00:28.162
I CAN'T SLEEP WITHOUT THE MUSIC
OF THE DOCKS.

00:28.196 --> 00:30.098
OKAY.

00:30.131 --> 00:31.399
THERE IT IS.

00:31.432 --> 00:33.767
OH, FOR PETE'S SAKE,
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

00:33.801 --> 00:35.269
ARE YOU A FISHERMAN?

00:35.303 --> 00:36.270
NIGHT.

00:36.304 --> 00:39.340
GOOD NIGHT.

00:39.373 --> 00:40.474
WHAT THE HELL?

00:40.508 --> 00:42.176
HMM?

00:42.210 --> 00:43.744
OH, MY MEAT STICKS.

00:43.777 --> 00:45.779
YEAH, I NEED PROTEIN.

00:45.813 --> 00:47.481
I EXERT A LOT OF ENERGY
WHEN I'M SLEEPING,

00:47.515 --> 00:49.617
DREAMING THAT I'M WINNING
THE OLYMPICS.

00:49.650 --> 00:53.387
ALL RIGHT,
HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.

00:53.421 --> 00:56.757
SEE HOW WE BOTH GET TO SLEEP
ON THE RIGHT SIDE.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.392
I LIKE IT.
IT'S LIKE YIN AND YANG.

00:58.426 --> 00:59.527
HMM?
OKAY.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.730
HEY, I'M THE WHITE HALF.
DID YOU HEAR ME?

01:02.763 --> 01:03.731
TICKY, TICKY!
TICKY, TICKY, TICKY!

01:03.764 --> 01:04.732
[chuckling]

01:04.765 --> 01:05.733
STOP TICKLING ME.

01:05.766 --> 01:07.301
TICKY, TICKY,
TICKY, TICKY--OW!

01:07.335 --> 01:08.302
OH, BOY!

01:08.336 --> 01:09.737
OH, MY GOD!
ARE YOU OKAY?

01:09.770 --> 01:11.305
NO, RAY RICE!
I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

01:11.339 --> 01:12.773
YOU DON'T KICK
YOUR GIRLFRIEND!

01:12.806 --> 01:13.841
YOU WERE TICKLING ME!

01:13.874 --> 01:17.077
[upbeat music]

01:18.446 --> 01:21.115
SO WAIT, WHY DO YOU
ALREADY OWN THAT?

01:21.149 --> 01:22.183
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR EYE?

01:22.216 --> 01:24.185
DANNY KICKED ME
IN THE FACE.

01:24.218 --> 01:26.354
YOU'RE MAKING IT SOUND
LIKE IT WASN'T AN ACCIDENT.

01:26.387 --> 01:27.655
OH, WAS IT AN ACCIDENT,
DANNY?

01:27.688 --> 01:29.390
I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE
MY BRAIN DOESN'T WORK,

01:29.423 --> 01:31.392
'CAUSE IT'S STILL HEALING
FROM GETTING KICKED IN THE FACE.

01:31.425 --> 01:32.626
I DO KNOW THAT THIS KIND
OF THING WOULDN'T HAPPEN

01:32.660 --> 01:34.395
IF YOU SPENT THE NIGHT
AT MY PLACE, EVER.

01:34.428 --> 01:35.729
I TRIED SPENDING THE NIGHT
AT YOUR PLACE,

01:35.763 --> 01:38.466
BUT I WAS IMMEDIATELY BURNED
BY THE STEAM SHOOTING

01:38.499 --> 01:39.667
OUT OF YOUR BUSTED RADIATOR.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.735
OH, YOU HATE STEAM, BUT YOU'LL
WATCH A FOUR HOUR DOCUMENTARY

01:41.769 --> 01:42.770
ON OLD FAITHFUL?

01:42.803 --> 01:44.805
ME? I'D LOVE TO GO
TO DR. L'S.

01:44.838 --> 01:46.407
I MEAN, ALL I GET TO DO
IS GO TO HER PLACE EVERY NIGHT

01:46.440 --> 01:47.875
FOR TURN DOWN SERVICE.

01:47.908 --> 01:51.779
OKAY, FINE. YES, TONIGHT,
I'LL STAY AT YOUR PLACE.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.347
REALLY?

01:53.381 --> 01:54.348
YES.

01:54.382 --> 01:56.150
HA-HA!
VICTORY, SUCKER!

01:56.184 --> 01:57.218
WOW, COME ON.

01:57.251 --> 01:58.219
SHE GOT YOU.

01:58.252 --> 01:59.287
SHE GOT ME.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.188
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE
THE BEST TIME.

02:00.221 --> 02:02.523
DR. L, THAT WOMAN
YOU MADE OUT WITH CALLED

02:02.556 --> 02:03.691
AND WANTS TO SEE YOU.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.259
DAMN IT, BEVERLY!

02:05.293 --> 02:06.460
HER NAME IS DR. FISHMAN

02:06.494 --> 02:07.561
AND SHE'S THE CHIEF
OF OBSTETRICS, OKAY?

02:07.595 --> 02:08.596
SHE'S OUR BOSS.

02:08.629 --> 02:12.266
FINE, OUR BOSS YOU MADE OUT
WITH WANTS TO SEE YOU.

02:15.903 --> 02:17.471
HEY, JEAN.

02:17.505 --> 02:18.439
HAVE YOU SEEN
THE SHOW BLACKISH?

02:18.472 --> 02:19.440
I THINK YOU'D LIKE IT.

02:19.473 --> 02:20.441
ZIP IT AND SIT.

02:20.474 --> 02:21.275
YEAH.

02:21.309 --> 02:22.843
YOUR NAME WAS SIGNED IN
TO DO ROUNDS

02:22.876 --> 02:24.445
WITH THE INTERNS
LAST NIGHT.

02:24.478 --> 02:27.181
BUT WHO DID I ACTUALLY FIND
WORKING WITH THEM?

02:27.215 --> 02:28.649
ME?

02:28.682 --> 02:29.850
DR. PRENTICE.

02:29.883 --> 02:31.519
OKAY, SO HAS HE BEEN
FORGING YOUR NAME

02:31.552 --> 02:32.520
ON THIS PAPERWORK?

02:32.553 --> 02:34.455
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
HE WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

02:34.488 --> 02:35.956
THAT WAS DR. REED.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.425
HE CAN ACTUALLY FORGE
ALL OF OUR SIGNATURES.

02:37.458 --> 02:38.492
IT'S PRETTY COOL.

02:38.526 --> 02:40.461
I MEAN, DO YOU THINK I WOULD
ACTUALLY SIGN A PETITION

02:40.494 --> 02:41.929
TO RAISE MINIMUM THE WAGE?

02:41.962 --> 02:43.464
WHAT?
SO MORGAN CAN EAT CAVIAR?

02:43.497 --> 02:44.598
I DON'T THINK SO.

02:44.632 --> 02:47.535
YOU KNOW THAT BEING AFFILIATED
WITH A TEACHING HOSPITAL

02:47.568 --> 02:50.371
MEANS YOU ACTUALLY
HAVE TO TEACH, RIGHT?

02:50.404 --> 02:53.674
YEAH, BUT HONESTLY, JEAN,
AREN'T I TOO YOUNG TO TEACH?

02:53.707 --> 02:55.576
I MEAN, LOOK AT ME.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.478
I THINK THE STUDENTS
WOULD BE VERY CONFUSED.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.213
THEY'D BE LIKE,
"SHE'S OUR TEACHER?

02:59.247 --> 03:00.681
"SHE SHOULD BE THE STAR
OF HER OWN DISNEY SHOW.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.250
I'M NOT GONNA LISTEN TO HER,
SHE'S TOO HOT!"

03:02.283 --> 03:04.785
THE STUDENTS IN THIS PROGRAM
ARE MOSTLY WOMEN.

03:04.818 --> 03:07.788
THEY NEED STRONG FEMALE
ROLE MODELS.

03:07.821 --> 03:10.458
IF YOU DON'T TEACH,
YOUR PRACTICE COULD LOSE

03:10.491 --> 03:12.426
IT'S AFFILIATION
WITH THIS HOSPITAL.

03:12.460 --> 03:15.696
YOU REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED
TO TRIBECA GYNECOLOGY?

03:15.729 --> 03:18.799
OR SHOULD I SAY DETROIT
GYNECOLOGY AND CHECK CASHING?

03:18.832 --> 03:21.502
YEAH, FINE,
I'LL, MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

03:21.535 --> 03:24.272
GOOD, BECAUSE YOU
DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

03:24.305 --> 03:25.273
YOU START TONIGHT.

03:25.306 --> 03:28.976
OH, TONIGHT
IS NOT GOOD FOR ME

03:29.009 --> 03:31.412
BECAUSE MY BOYFRIEND--

03:31.445 --> 03:34.448
"BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,"
DON'T CARE, GOOD-BYE.

03:34.482 --> 03:35.516
OKAY.

03:35.549 --> 03:36.584
[knock at door]

03:36.617 --> 03:38.619
COMING!

03:38.652 --> 03:39.853
HELLO, MY LOVE.

03:39.887 --> 03:41.555
WELCOME BACK TO PARADISE.

03:41.589 --> 03:42.723
OH, GOD.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.425
IT'S LIKE GREY GARDENS IN HERE.

03:44.458 --> 03:45.526
OKAY.

03:45.559 --> 03:48.396
I'LL BE SMOTHERED BY A
COLLAPSING TOWER OF TCHOTCHKES.

03:48.429 --> 03:49.263
OKAY, THAT'S VERY DRAMATIC.

03:49.297 --> 03:50.331
AND YOU DON'T HAVE
TO COMPLAIN SO MUCH.

03:50.364 --> 03:52.700
MY APARTMENT IS NOT THAT
DIFFERENT THAN YOURS, DANNY.

03:52.733 --> 03:56.304
YOU HAVE YOUR PIANO.
I HAVE A CHILDREN'S XYLOPHONE.

03:56.337 --> 03:59.006
[random xylophone notes]

03:59.039 --> 04:01.309
OH! IN ADDITION TO
MY MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS,

04:01.342 --> 04:03.344
TO DISTRACT US,
WE ALSO HAVE SEX.

04:03.377 --> 04:08.015
GIVE ME!
OH, WOW.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.417
NOW WAIT A MINUTE,
WAIT A MINUTE.

04:09.450 --> 04:10.318
CAN WE EVEN DO THIS?

04:10.351 --> 04:11.719
I THOUGHT YOU HAD
TO TEACH RESIDENTS.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.053
MM, I DID.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.656
BUT MY HOT BOYFRIEND SPENDING
THE NIGHT WAS PRIORITY.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.625
SO I HAD SOMEONE COVER FOR ME.

04:17.658 --> 04:20.428
A VERY DISTINGUISHED COLLEAGUE
AND WOMAN OF COLOR.

04:20.461 --> 04:21.429
WHO?

04:21.462 --> 04:23.597
GOOD EVENING, FINE PUPILS.

04:23.631 --> 04:27.368
I'M DR. TAMRA WEBB,

04:36.544 --> 04:37.945
[phone rings]

04:37.978 --> 04:39.613
HOLD ON.
NO, NO.

04:39.647 --> 04:42.516
DON'T GET IT.
YOU'VE GOT MINDY.

04:42.550 --> 04:43.951
HAVE YOU LOST
YOUR DAMN MIND?

04:43.984 --> 04:45.819
OH, JEAN, HI.

04:45.853 --> 04:48.822
WHY IS YOUR NURSE HERE
PERFORMING INSPIRATIONAL POETRY

04:48.856 --> 04:50.491
FOR MY INTERNS?

04:50.524 --> 04:51.692
NO, NO, NO, NO,
SHE'S THE OPENING ACT.

04:51.725 --> 04:52.760
I AM THE HEADLINER.

04:52.793 --> 04:55.629
YOU BETTER GET DOWN HERE,
AND GET DOWN HERE NOW,

04:55.663 --> 04:58.566
OR THE ONLY THING
YOU'LL BE DELIVERING ARE BOXES.

04:58.599 --> 05:01.335
WHY? 'CAUSE YOU'LL BE WORKING
AT THE POST OFFICE.

05:01.369 --> 05:02.936
VERY ELABORATE BURN, JEAN.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.406
OKAY, I WILL BE RIGHT THERE.

05:05.439 --> 05:07.375
I'M SO SORRY.

05:07.408 --> 05:08.609
OKAY, I'LL BE BACK SOON.

05:08.642 --> 05:09.677
JUST AMUSE YOURSELF
IN MY PALACE.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.111
MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME.

OH, NELLY.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.892

ALWAYS LATE,
BUT WORTH THE WAIT.

06:31.925 --> 06:32.960
HI, EVERYBODY.
MY NAME'S DR. LAHIRI.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.194
I AM YOUR REAL TEACHER.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.930
AND LET ME ASSURE YOU, THIS WILL
NOT BE ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS

06:36.964 --> 06:38.766
WHERE I END UP
LEARNING MORE FROM YOU.

06:38.799 --> 06:40.868
DR. LAHIRI,
THOMAS JAMIL GIGAK,

06:40.901 --> 06:42.035
YOU CAN CALL ME TJ.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.604
IT'S AN HONOR TO BE WORKING
WITH YOU.

06:43.637 --> 06:46.574
TJ WAS NUMBER ONE IN HIS CLASS
AT HARVARD MEDICAL.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.041
HE'S BASICALLY LIKE
DOOGIE HOWSER,

06:48.075 --> 06:50.077
EXCEPT, YOU KNOW,
OF A NORMAL AGE.

06:50.110 --> 06:51.211
PETER, YOU'RE MAKING
MY EAR HOT.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.747
OUR PATIENT IS MARY MOLLOY,
AGE 39,

06:53.781 --> 06:55.082
SUFFERING FROM A TORSED OVARY.

06:55.115 --> 06:56.183
THANK YOU TJ.

06:56.216 --> 06:58.218
ALL RIGHT, WHO HERE CAN TELL ME
WHAT "TORSED" MEANS?

06:58.251 --> 06:59.953
MM, IT MEANS THAT HER OVARIES
ARE--

06:59.987 --> 07:01.054
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
TJ, ACTUALLY,

07:01.088 --> 07:02.956
THE WAY THAT THIS WORKS
IS THAT I CALL ON THE PERSON

07:02.990 --> 07:04.157
AND THEY ANSWER.

07:04.191 --> 07:06.059
WHY WASTE YOUR TIME WHEN YOU
KNOW THAT I KNOW THE ANSWER.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.795
I'M NOT AFRAID
OF WASTING MY TIME

07:07.828 --> 07:08.996
AS YOU WILL ALL SOON FIND OUT.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.197
OKAY, BUTLER, WHAT DOES "TORSED"
MEAN? GO.

07:10.230 --> 07:13.200

07:13.233 --> 07:16.670
UH, HOW ABOUT YOU?

07:16.704 --> 07:18.005
DO YOU KNOW THE ANSWER?

07:18.038 --> 07:20.007
EXCELLENT CHOICE.
THAT'S CANDACE LEE.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.976
SHE WAS RANKED 82

07:26.980 --> 07:27.748
CANDACE, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO ANSWER?

07:27.781 --> 07:31.151
A UM, TORSED OVARY
MEANS YOUR OVARY

07:31.184 --> 07:32.953
HAS TWISTED ON ITSELF?

07:32.986 --> 07:34.221
IS THAT A QUESTION
OR AN ANSWER?

07:34.254 --> 07:36.524
BECAUSE IF IT'S AN ANSWER,
IT'S CORRECT.

07:36.557 --> 07:37.525
(Peter)
VERY GOOD.

07:37.558 --> 07:38.892
SO, WHAT SHOULD WE DO?

07:38.926 --> 07:41.128
WE'LL BE PERFORMING A SIMPLE
LAPAROSCOPIC SURGERY

07:41.161 --> 07:42.162
TO UNCOIL IT.

07:42.195 --> 07:45.499

08:09.022 --> 08:12.259
DAMN IT, NOW I'M HUNGRY."

08:12.292 --> 08:15.563
MRS. MOLLOY, YOUR OVARIES
ARE IN GOOD HANDS.

08:15.596 --> 08:17.798
ONE OF MY ALL-EQUALLY-QUALIFIED
INTERNS

08:17.831 --> 08:19.166
WILL BE ASSISTING ME
IN THE PROCEDURE.

08:19.199 --> 08:21.635
BUT I LIKE HIM.
THE MAN.

08:21.669 --> 08:24.605
HIS CONFIDENCE REMINDS ME OF
A YOUNG, BLACK BURT REYNOLDS.

08:24.638 --> 08:25.606
CAN HE DO IT?

08:25.639 --> 08:27.808
YEAH, HIM,
OR SOMEONE LIKE HIM.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.043
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,
CONFIDENCE CONTRIBUTES

08:30.077 --> 08:31.211
TO HIGH MORTALITY RATES.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.113
LEARNED THAT THE HARD WAY.
MM.

08:33.146 --> 08:35.583
OH! YOU KNOW WHO SHOULD HELP ME,
IS MY INTERN CANDACE.

08:35.616 --> 08:38.085
ARE YOU CRAZY?
SHE'S THE WORSE ONE BY FAR.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.319
YOU JUST HAVE TO GET
TO KNOW HER.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.320
YOU WILL LOVE HER.

08:40.353 --> 08:41.922
CANDACE?

08:41.955 --> 08:44.592
CA--WHERE'S CANDACE?

08:44.625 --> 08:46.660
CANDACE, COME HERE.
I'M GONNA GO GET HER.

08:46.694 --> 08:48.328
BECAUSE HANDHOLDING
IS PART OF TEACHING.

08:48.361 --> 08:51.298
[whispering]
WHAT THE HELL?
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME.

08:51.331 --> 08:54.702
MRS. MOLLOY, THIS IS CANDACE,
THE INTERN I WAS RAVING ABOUT.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.136
ARE YOU SURE
THIS IS A GOOD IDEA?

08:56.169 --> 08:57.871
DAMN IT, CANDACE.

08:57.905 --> 09:00.140
(Mindy)
"DEAR DIARY,
MAY 11, 2012.

09:00.173 --> 09:02.075
OH, MY GOD,
I HAD A HOT SEX DREAM

09:02.109 --> 09:03.777
ABOUT THAT JERK,
DANNY CASTELLANO,

09:03.811 --> 09:04.745
LAST NIGHT.

09:04.778 --> 09:06.213
WHAT IF I GET TURNED ON
WHEN I LOOK AT HIM?

09:06.246 --> 09:08.315
UGH, THAT CUTE LITTLE TUSH.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.083
LIKE TWO SCRUMPTIOUS EMPANADAS.

09:10.117 --> 09:11.685
DAMN IT, NOW I'M HUNGRY."

09:11.719 --> 09:13.887
WAY TO GO, DANNY JUNIOR.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.358
ALL SCRUBBED IN.
LISTEN, VERY EXCITED

09:18.391 --> 09:19.660
AND HUMBLED TO TAKE THE LEAD
ON THIS ONE.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.061
WAIT, WHAT?

09:21.094 --> 09:22.262
(Mindy)
YOU ARE NOT TAKING THE LEAD
ON THIS ONE.

09:22.295 --> 09:23.396
DAMN IT!

09:23.430 --> 09:25.633
I TOLD YOU THAT CANDACE
WAS DOING THE SURGERY, NOT YOU.

09:25.666 --> 09:28.301
DR. LAHIRI, MRS. MOLLOY
SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR ME

09:28.335 --> 09:30.037
TO PERFORM THE SURGERY.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.039
NOW, I JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE
YOU GET IN TROUBLE

09:32.072 --> 09:33.273
BECAUSE CANDACE
IS ILL-EQUIPPED.

09:33.306 --> 09:35.208
OH, YOU DON'T WANNA SEE ME
GET IN TROUBLE?

09:35.242 --> 09:37.377
LISTEN, POINDEXTER,
THIS ATTITUDE OF YOURS,

09:37.410 --> 09:38.912
IT MIGHT'VE WORKED IN WHATEVER
ENCLAVE OF ENTITLEMENT

09:38.946 --> 09:40.147
YOU CAME FROM--

09:40.180 --> 09:42.082
I'M FROM HARLEM,
MY PARENTS ARE FROM THE SUDAN.

09:42.115 --> 09:44.317
THE--IN AFRICA?
YEAH.

09:44.351 --> 09:45.352
LOOK, I'M VERY--
I DID NOT KNOW THAT.

09:45.385 --> 09:46.687
I'M VERY SORRY.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.356
THIS IS MY O.R.
AND WHAT I SAY GOES.

09:49.389 --> 09:51.124
AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT,
TOUGH.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.125
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CALL ME
AROUND HERE?

09:52.159 --> 09:53.193
THEY CALL ME SARGE.

09:53.226 --> 09:54.227
(Tamra)
ACTUALLY, THAT DIDN'T STICK.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.729
WE STILL CALL YOU MEATBALL.

09:55.763 --> 09:56.997
YOU BETTER LISTEN
TO MEATBALL!

09:57.030 --> 09:58.832
YEAH, YOU BETTER LISTEN
TO MEATBALL.

09:58.866 --> 09:59.667
NOW JUST WATCH AND LEARN.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.101
I DON'T WANNA HEAR
ABOUT THIS ANY MORE.

10:01.134 --> 10:02.770
CANDACE!

10:02.803 --> 10:06.106
(Mindy)
"OH, MY GOD,
DANNY KISSED ME ON THE PLANE!

10:06.139 --> 10:08.709
IT WAS THE MOMENT
I HAD DREAMED OF FOR YEARS.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.343
I WAS SO EXCITED
I DIDN'T EVEN FINISH WATCHING

10:10.377 --> 10:12.379
BEVERLY HILLS CHIHUAHUA
AFTERWARDS."

10:12.412 --> 10:14.815
TURN DOWN SERVICE!
OH! MORGAN!

10:14.848 --> 10:17.184
WHAT'D YOU DO?
OH, NO. THIS IS BAD.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.188
HOLY MACKEREL!
THIS IS DR. L'S DIARY!

10:21.221 --> 10:23.190
NO KIDDING, MORGAN.
DOES SHE MENTION ME?

10:23.223 --> 10:24.391
THIS IS SERIOUS, OKAY?

10:24.424 --> 10:26.026
I'M SORRY, BUD.
THERE'S NO WAY OUT OF THIS.

10:26.059 --> 10:29.029
I MEAN, UNLESS YOU SOMEHOW MADE
A COPY OF THE DIARY.

10:29.062 --> 10:30.063
AND FOR THAT YOU WOULD NEED
SOMEONE WHO COULD FORGE

10:30.097 --> 10:31.364
DR. L'S HANDWRITING.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.166
AND THE ONLY PERSON
WHO COULD DO THAT IS,

10:33.200 --> 10:35.402
I DON'T KNOW, DR. REED,
BUT HE'S ALL THE WAY AT WORK.

10:35.435 --> 10:36.937
SO YOU ARE SCREWED.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.673
WAIT A MINUTE,
YOU'RE RIGHT, MORGAN.

10:39.707 --> 10:40.708
JEREMY'S THE ANSWER.

10:40.741 --> 10:43.010
TO WHAT?

10:43.043 --> 10:43.944
NO, I WON'T DO IT.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.412
OKAY? WHEN I GOT MY
CALLIGRAPHER'S LICENSE,

10:45.445 --> 10:47.047
I SWORE I WOULD ONLY USE
IT FOR GOOD.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.682
YOU KNOW WHAT? FINE.
YOU KNOW WHAT? DON'T HELP ME.

10:48.716 --> 10:50.117
I'LL JUST TELL MINDY
THAT I READ HER DIARY

10:50.150 --> 10:51.251
SHE'LL DUMP ME,
WE'LL HAVE A MESSY BREAK-UP,

10:51.284 --> 10:53.754
AND ALL WORK WILL COME TO A HALT
FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS.

10:53.787 --> 10:54.855
I'VE ALREADY STOPPED WORKING.

10:54.888 --> 10:57.357
OH, DEAR GOD, IT WILL BE
THE FALKLANDS ALL OVER AGAIN.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.693
YEAH, IT WILL BE.
WHAT ARE THE FALKLANDS?

10:59.727 --> 11:00.694
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WHEN YOU SAY FALK--

11:00.728 --> 11:01.695
(Mindy)
HEY, YOU GUYS!

11:01.729 --> 11:02.696
[all three startled]

11:02.730 --> 11:04.064
OH! HEY, BABE.

11:04.097 --> 11:04.865
WOW, SO WE'RE HANGING OUT
IN JEREMY'S OFFICE, HUH?

11:04.898 --> 11:06.767
COOL.
HAVE I EVER BEEN IN HERE?

11:06.800 --> 11:07.768
GET OUT.

11:07.801 --> 11:08.902
EXCUSE ME?

11:08.936 --> 11:09.903
WE'RE HAVING A PRIVATE
MEN'S SALON.

11:09.937 --> 11:10.904
STAY, LEAVE.

11:10.938 --> 11:12.005
(Jeremy)
DO LEAVE, THOUGH.

11:12.039 --> 11:13.106
OKAY, WELL,
THAT'S ALL VERY RUDE.

11:13.140 --> 11:14.207
I'M SORRY.
OH, I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU.

11:14.241 --> 11:16.176
I AM SO SORRY THAT I DIDN'T
MAKE IT HOME LAST NIGHT.

11:16.209 --> 11:17.477
DID YOU FIND ANYTHING TO DO?

11:17.510 --> 11:20.280
OH YEAH, HE DID.
[laughing]

11:20.313 --> 11:21.849
NO, IT'S FINE.
I DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING PERSONAL,

11:21.882 --> 11:23.016
I JUST FOUND A BOOK LYING AROUND
AND I READ IT.

11:23.050 --> 11:25.118
OH, GREAT SEXPECTATIONS,
THE KIM CATTRALL BOOK.

11:25.152 --> 11:27.120
YES.
SO GOOD.
PAGE-TURNER, RIGHT?

11:27.154 --> 11:28.121
HE'S A SAMANTHA.

11:28.155 --> 11:29.122
I'M A SAMANTHA.
BIG TIME.

11:29.156 --> 11:30.190
AREN'T WE ALL?

11:30.223 --> 11:31.391
I AM!
QUITE.
YEAH.

11:31.424 --> 11:34.227
WHAT A NERD.
COME HERE, YOU.

11:34.261 --> 11:35.362
YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD BOYFRIEND.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.831
AS A REWARD, I THINK TONIGHT
WE SHOULD SPEND THE NIGHT

11:37.865 --> 11:39.800
AT YOUR PLACE.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.068
YOU'RE GONNA SPEND THE NIGHT
AT MY PLACE?

11:41.101 --> 11:42.069
THAT HELPS US OUT
SO MUCH.

11:42.102 --> 11:43.136
YEAH THAT'S PERFECT FOR...

11:43.170 --> 11:44.137
THAT WORKS.

11:44.171 --> 11:45.472
OKAY, WELL,
LATER HATERS!

11:45.505 --> 11:46.339
ALL RIGHT,
LATER--THAT'S FUNNY.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.275
"LATER HATERS."
"LATER HATER" YOURSELF.

11:48.308 --> 11:49.276
ISN'T THAT FUNNY,
"LATER HATERS," THAT'S CUTE.

11:49.309 --> 11:50.277
(Jeremy)
ITS RHYMES.

11:50.310 --> 11:51.912
OH, MY GOD,
WE ALMOST BLEW IT.

11:51.945 --> 11:53.280
WHAT IS WRONG WITH US?

11:53.313 --> 11:54.614
NOW WE'RE ALL IN ON THE LIE.

11:54.647 --> 11:56.483
(Dan)
JEREMY, COME ON.
YOU'RE MY ONLY HOPE.

11:56.516 --> 11:58.752
FINE, FINE.
WELL, I BETTER GET STARTED.

11:58.786 --> 12:01.889
OH, HELLO, DR. FISHMAN.

12:01.922 --> 12:03.156
I KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE.

12:03.190 --> 12:04.257
YOU HEARD THAT MY MENTEE,
CANDACE,

12:04.291 --> 12:07.294
PERFORMED HER FIRST SUCCESSFUL
SURGERY LAST NIGHT.

12:07.327 --> 12:10.030
NOW THAT I'M A TEACHER
I WILL BE TAKING SUMMERS OFF.

12:10.063 --> 12:13.200
A STUDENT JUST FILED A SEXISM
COMPLAINT AGAINST YOU, MINDY!

12:13.233 --> 12:14.301
WAIT, WHAT?

12:14.334 --> 12:15.502
WAS IT TJ?

12:15.535 --> 12:18.538
GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE HE CALLED
ME A SEXIST.

12:18.571 --> 12:21.374
IS IT POSSIBLE HE SAID "SEXY"?

12:21.408 --> 12:24.244
THIS IS SERIOUS.
WE CANNOT HAVE A PROMINENT

12:24.277 --> 12:26.947
MALE INTERN THINKING
THAT THIS DEPARTMENT

12:26.980 --> 12:30.217
IS BEING RUN BY MEAN,
MAN-HATING LESBIANS.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.251
I'M NOT A MEAN LESBIAN.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.786
NEITHER AM I.

12:32.820 --> 12:34.822
I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW
THAT AT MY LAST HOSPITAL

12:34.855 --> 12:37.190
I WAS VOTED
THE NICEST LESBIAN.

12:37.224 --> 12:39.059
CONGRATULATIONS.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.895
YOU NEED TO FIX THIS,
AND YOU NEED TO FIX IT WHEN?

12:41.929 --> 12:44.331
NOW.
OKAY, GOING.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.299
YOU'RE NOT WINNING ANY NICE
LESBIAN AWARDS THIS YEAR.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.301
WHAT WAS THAT?
NOTHING, NOTHING,
I SAID NOTHING.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.540
HEY, TJ.
YOU'RE A GYM RAT TOO.

12:53.573 --> 12:55.976
HEY, DID THIS TREADMILL
JUST ASK MY WEIGHT?

12:56.009 --> 12:57.210
RUDE.

12:57.244 --> 12:58.245
SO NOW YOU'RE READY
TO GIVE YOUR STAR INTERN

12:58.278 --> 12:59.346
SOME ATTENTION.

12:59.379 --> 13:00.180
PSSH, YOU WISH.

13:00.213 --> 13:01.381
I'M JUST HERE
FOR THE JOY OF RUNNING,

13:01.414 --> 13:02.215
LIKE YOU.

13:02.249 --> 13:04.317
IN COLLEGE THEY USED
TO CALL ME FLOJO.

13:04.351 --> 13:05.819
MORE SO BECAUSE
OF MY PERIOD, BUT STILL.

13:05.853 --> 13:07.988
DR. LAHIRI,
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK, OKAY?

13:08.021 --> 13:08.989
MY COMPLAINT'S LEGIT.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.123
AND I AM NOT GONNA BE BULLIED

13:10.157 --> 13:12.059
BY THE OPPRESSIVE MATRIARCHAL
ESTABLISHMENT THAT YOU--

13:12.092 --> 13:14.227
OKAY, THAT IS ENOUGH!

13:14.261 --> 13:17.364
AAH!

13:17.397 --> 13:18.365
DR. LAHIRI,
I WORKED REALLY HARD

13:18.398 --> 13:20.233
TO GET HERE, OKAY?

13:20.267 --> 13:22.369
I PAID MY WAY THROUGH SCHOOL
BY WASHING DISHES

13:22.402 --> 13:24.371
AND SELLING AN APP
TO MICROSOFT.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.373
AND JUST BECAUSE YOU SEE
YOURSELF IN SOME GIRL,

13:26.406 --> 13:27.240
I'M GETTING PASSED OVER?

13:27.274 --> 13:29.910
WHOA, WHOA,
SLOW YOUR ROLL, JUNIOR.

13:29.943 --> 13:31.311
I DON'T SEE MYSELF IN CANDACE.

13:31.344 --> 13:32.312
I SEE MYSELF IN YOU.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.314
WHAT?

13:34.347 --> 13:35.849
YEAH.
TOP OF MY CLASS,

13:35.883 --> 13:37.417
BIG MOUTH,
FLAWLESS CHOCOLATE SKIN,

13:37.450 --> 13:38.418
BANGING BODY.

13:38.451 --> 13:39.319
YEAH.

13:39.352 --> 13:41.388
YOU ARE SMARTER THAN
THE OTHER STUDENTS,

13:41.421 --> 13:43.423
AND SURE, THEY'RE PROBABLY GONNA
BECOME CRUISE SHIP DOCTORS.

13:43.456 --> 13:46.193
BUT YOU HAVE TO LET THEM
HAVE A CHANCE TOO.

13:46.226 --> 13:47.360
WHY?

13:47.394 --> 13:48.996
IF YOU'RE A DOCTOR THAT DOESN'T
KNOW HOW TO GET ALONG

13:49.029 --> 13:52.132
WITH OTHER PEOPLE,
THEN YOU'RE A BAD DOCTOR.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.501
LOOK, JUST APOLOGIZE
TO CANDACE.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.436
YOU WERE A REAL TURD
TO HER THE OTHER DAY.

13:56.469 --> 13:57.537
OKAY.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.206
BUT ONLY IF YOU APOLOGIZE
FOR DRINKING

13:59.239 --> 14:00.207
ALL OF MY SPORTS DRINK.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.441
THIS?
OH, NO, NO.

14:01.474 --> 14:03.944
I'VE HAD THIS FOR YEARS.

14:03.977 --> 14:05.345
(Jeremy)
OH!

14:05.378 --> 14:06.413
(Danny)
WHAT? WHAT'D YOU READ?

14:06.446 --> 14:08.115
THE LIST WHERE SHE RANKS
THE RACES?

14:08.148 --> 14:09.349
I KNOW, IT'S CHILLING.

14:09.382 --> 14:10.350
I SHOULDN'T BE READING THIS.

14:10.383 --> 14:11.651
THIS IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.320
YEAH, NO.
IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS,

14:13.353 --> 14:14.321
BUT IT'S OUR BUSINESS.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.056
READ IT, DR. REED.

14:16.089 --> 14:17.324
FINE.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.592
"DEAR DIARY, TONIGHT,
I HAD THE MOST.."

14:19.626 --> 14:21.261
(Mindy)
"WONDERFUL DATE WITH DANNY.

14:21.294 --> 14:23.330
WE WENT FOR A LONG WALK
IN THE MOONLIGHT.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.432
AND THEN,
WHEN WE GOT BACK HOME,

14:25.465 --> 14:29.970
DANNY GOT DOWN ON ONE KNEE
AND SAID..."

14:30.003 --> 14:31.338
[gasps]

14:31.371 --> 14:34.407
MINDY KUHEL LAHIRI...

14:34.441 --> 14:36.243
OH, MY GOD.

14:36.276 --> 14:39.646
DID YOU VOTE FOR DEBLASIO?

14:39.679 --> 14:41.248
WHAT?

14:41.281 --> 14:45.018
BECAUSE IF YOU DID,
THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE GONNA GET.

14:45.052 --> 14:47.187
TRASH ON THE STREET.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.456
UGH. MAN.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.424
"(Mindy)
I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY,
BUT I REALLY THOUGHT

14:51.458 --> 14:52.559
HE WAS GONNA PROPOSE.

14:52.592 --> 14:55.095
WE'VE BEEN DATING FOR MONTHS,
AND HE DOESN'T EVEN LIKE

14:55.128 --> 14:56.429
SPENDING THE NIGHT
AT MY PLACE.

14:56.463 --> 14:58.331
AND EVEN THOUGH I'M BUILT
LIKE A 15-YEAR-OLD,

14:58.365 --> 14:59.933
I'M NOT GETTING ANY YOUNGER.

14:59.967 --> 15:01.534
IF HE DOESN'T PROPOSE
BY CHRISTMAS,

15:01.568 --> 15:02.602
I MIGHT HAVE TO MOVE ON."

15:02.635 --> 15:04.471
MARRIAGE?

15:04.504 --> 15:06.506
MARRIAGE? I MEAN, WE'VE ONLY
BEEN DATING FOR SEVEN MONTHS.

15:06.539 --> 15:09.276
I MEAN, THAT--THAT'S A LITTLE
BIT CRAZY, RIGHT, GUYS?

15:09.309 --> 15:10.443
(both)
MM...

15:10.477 --> 15:11.979
I DON'T KNOW
IF I'D CALL IT CRAZY.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.480
YEAH, I MEAN, YOU'RE BOTH
TURNING 50 SOON,

15:13.513 --> 15:14.948
AND LET'S BE HONEST,
YOU'RE SOMETHING

15:14.982 --> 15:16.349
OF AN ACQUIRED TASTE.

15:16.383 --> 15:18.418
AND WHAT I'M SAYING IS,
YOU'RE OUT OF OPTIONS.

15:18.451 --> 15:19.352
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

15:19.386 --> 15:21.088
MY BARISTA PUTS HEARTS
ON MY COFFEE CUP.

15:21.121 --> 15:23.123
SURE, YOU'VE ONLY BEEN DATING
FOR SEVEN MONTHS,

15:23.156 --> 15:25.492
BUT YOU'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER
FOR SEVEN YEARS.

15:25.525 --> 15:28.028
THAT IS A COMMON LAW MARRIAGE.

15:28.061 --> 15:29.596
LIKE I HAVE
WITH MY HOUSEMAN, PAO.

15:29.629 --> 15:33.400
DON'T YOU UN--WHAT?

15:33.433 --> 15:36.403
OH, HELLO, FELLOW SEXIST!

15:36.436 --> 15:37.604
OKAY.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.606
YOU KNOW, FOR THE WORLD'S
BIGGEST SEXIST

15:39.639 --> 15:41.708
NEVER TO HAVE A COMPLAINT FILED
AGAINST HIM,

15:41.741 --> 15:44.177
I'D SAY YOU MUST'VE DONE
SOMETHING PRETTY BAD.

15:44.211 --> 15:46.079
OKAY, IT DOESN'T MATTER,
IT'S ALL FIXED NOW.

15:46.113 --> 15:47.647
I TALKED TO TJ
AND I EXPLAINED TO HIM

15:47.680 --> 15:50.984
THE IMPORTANCE OF ENCOURAGING
QUIETER STUDENTS LIKE CANDACE.

15:51.018 --> 15:52.052
OH.

15:52.085 --> 15:53.620
OH, THERE THEY ARE NOW.

15:53.653 --> 15:56.456
[indistinct chatter]

15:56.489 --> 15:57.457
WHOA!

15:57.490 --> 16:00.393
CANDACE!

16:00.427 --> 16:02.429
SHE REALLY HAS
TAKEN AFTER YOU.

16:05.165 --> 16:08.201
YEAH, SHE WANTS ME TO
PROPOSE BY CHRISTMAS.

16:08.235 --> 16:09.602
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

16:09.636 --> 16:12.272
IT'S TOO MUCH PRESSURE
ON THE LORD'S BIRTHDAY.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.174
I MEAN, YOU THINK
THAT'S CRAZY, RIGHT?

16:14.207 --> 16:16.609
OF COURSE IT'S CRAZY!

16:16.643 --> 16:17.610
YOU SHOULD BREAK UP WITH HER.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.779
WHAT?
NO! NO.

16:19.812 --> 16:20.713
I'M NOT DOING THAT.

16:20.747 --> 16:22.749
WE JUST WENT 50-50
ON A UNISEX RAINCOAT.

16:22.782 --> 16:24.584
SHE'S OLD, DANNY.

16:24.617 --> 16:26.186
YOU CAN PRACTICALLY HEAR
THE LAST EGG

16:26.219 --> 16:27.487
RATTLING AROUND IN THERE.

16:27.520 --> 16:28.655
MA! COME ON!

16:28.688 --> 16:31.191
YOU DON'T STRING ALONG
A GIRL HER AGE.

16:31.224 --> 16:36.129
IF YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT GONNA
PROPOSE, YOU GOTTA END IT.

16:36.163 --> 16:38.165
[phone chimes]

16:45.438 --> 16:46.539
HER PLACE.
WHAT?

16:46.573 --> 16:48.041
THE DIARY.

16:48.075 --> 16:49.709
I GOTTA GO, MA.
I LOVE YOU

16:49.742 --> 16:52.445
WHERE YOU GO--WHAT?
NOW?

16:52.479 --> 16:56.183
WHAT--LOOK AT THE MESS HERE.

16:56.216 --> 17:01.221
SO WHAT IF THE PATIENT IS
AFEBRILE AND NOT TACHYCARDIC?

17:01.254 --> 17:02.222
DR. LAHIRI?

17:02.255 --> 17:03.356
YES.

17:03.390 --> 17:04.324
UH, I THINK CANDACE PROBABLY
KNOWS THE ANSWER TO THAT.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.159
THANK YOU, GIGAK.

17:06.193 --> 17:07.094
CANDACE?

17:07.127 --> 17:09.696
I'M SO SORRY,
I WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.598
WHAT WAS THE QUESTION?
OH, GREAT.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.766
CANDACE IS STILL LAME
AND YOU BROKE TJ.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.468
I KNOW, I KNOW, OKAY.

17:15.502 --> 17:18.205
HEY, COME HERE. I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND.

17:18.238 --> 17:20.373
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?
YOU NEED TO FOCUS.

17:20.407 --> 17:21.474
YOU CAN'T GET DISTRACTED
BY BOYS,

17:21.508 --> 17:22.475
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA BE THE BEST.

17:22.509 --> 17:23.743
LEAVE ME ALONE!

17:23.776 --> 17:26.813
IF BEING THE BEST MEANS BEING
A BOSSY STRESSED-OUT SPINSTER,

17:26.846 --> 17:27.680
THEN NO THANKS.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.416
YOU HAD THAT ONE
LOCKED AND LOADED, HUH?

17:29.449 --> 17:30.417
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

17:30.450 --> 17:31.418
I BELIEVED IN YOU.

17:31.451 --> 17:33.520
AND I BELIEVE IN NOTHING,
OKAY?

17:33.553 --> 17:35.255
I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED,
CANDACE.

17:35.288 --> 17:36.256
THIS MENTORSHIP IS OVER.

17:36.289 --> 17:38.358
LEAVE THE SIGNED HEADSHOT
I GAVE YOU ON MY DESK.

17:38.391 --> 17:39.459
GET OUT OF HERE,
I DON'T WANNA LOOK AT YOU.

17:39.492 --> 17:40.460
EVERYONE, I'M DONE.

17:40.493 --> 17:41.528
I CAN'T DO THIS ANY MORE.

17:41.561 --> 17:44.497
OKAY, SHE'S AGITATED
AND CALLING IT A DAY, WORK-WISE.

17:44.531 --> 17:46.166
THIS IS GONNA
HAPPEN A LOT.

17:46.199 --> 17:47.334
THANK YOU, PETER.

17:47.367 --> 17:48.335
TELL ME IT'S DONE.

17:48.368 --> 17:49.336
FINITO.

17:49.369 --> 17:50.337
IT IS DONE?

17:50.370 --> 17:51.771
FINITO IS ITALIAN FOR DONE.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.306
THANK YOU.
[phone buzzes]

18:01.548 --> 18:04.584
DR. LAHIRI,
I AM IMPRESSED.

18:04.617 --> 18:06.619
WITH WHAT?
MY HAIR?

18:06.653 --> 18:07.854
IT'S NOT EVEN MINE.

18:07.887 --> 18:09.122
IT'S FROM A DEAD WOMAN.

18:09.156 --> 18:10.757
I'M IMPRESSED
WITH YOUR TEACHING.

18:10.790 --> 18:13.526
HOW? I TRIED TO MENTOR CANDACE
AND I MADE HER WORSE.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.262
THEY CAN'T ALL BE TOP OF CLASS.

18:15.295 --> 18:17.297
I MEAN, FOR EVERY
SANJAY GUPTA

18:17.330 --> 18:19.566
THERE'S A DOZEN
MICHAEL JACKSON DOCTORS.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.168
REALLY?

18:21.201 --> 18:22.235
BUT YOU DID MENTOR
SOMEONE TONIGHT.

18:22.269 --> 18:25.605
JUST NOT THE PERSON YOU THOUGHT
YOU WERE MENTORING.

18:25.638 --> 18:28.808
OH, MY GOD,
ALL ALONG,

18:28.841 --> 18:31.511
THE PERSON I WAS
MENTORING WAS ME.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.413
NO, THAT'S STUPID.

18:33.446 --> 18:36.716
TJ. THE PERSON YOU WERE
MENTORING WAS TJ.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.485
OH, MY GOD!

18:38.518 --> 18:41.588
ALL ALONG, THE PERSON I WAS
MENTORING WAS TJ.

18:41.621 --> 18:42.789
THAT'S WHAT I JUST SAID.

18:42.822 --> 18:45.392
YOU ARE SO DAMN WISE, JEAN.

18:45.425 --> 18:48.695
YOU ARE WISER THAN YOUR YEARS.

18:48.728 --> 18:51.431
ACTUALLY, MAYBE YOUR AS WISE
AS YOUR YEARS.

18:51.464 --> 18:52.865
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

18:52.899 --> 18:54.701
MOST REAL LESBIANS
ARE LIKE, IN THEIR 40s, RIGHT?

18:54.734 --> 18:55.702
THAT'S SOMETHING I'VE NOTICED.

18:55.735 --> 18:56.703
SETTLE.

18:56.736 --> 18:59.472
YOU GOT ONE THING RIGHT,
BUT 1,000 THINGS WRONG.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.241
DON'T GET A BIG HEAD
ABOUT IT.

19:01.274 --> 19:03.310
TOO LATE, I'LL NEVER REMEMBER
THE WRONG THINGS

19:03.343 --> 19:04.777
AND I'LL ONLY REMEMBER
THE RIGHT THING.

19:14.321 --> 19:15.722
THANKS.

19:20.427 --> 19:22.262
UNH!

19:22.295 --> 19:23.463
THANKS.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.232
WHAT THE HELL, MAN?

19:25.265 --> 19:26.966
THERE'S LIKE, NO TOPPINGS
ON HERE.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.868
RIGHT THERE.
I'M JUST GONNA DO IT MYSELF.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.506
SO SORRY ABOUT THAT.

19:33.540 --> 19:34.541
[elevator dings]

19:57.364 --> 19:59.266
[random xylophone notes]

19:59.299 --> 20:00.267
HEY!

20:00.300 --> 20:01.268
HEY.

20:01.301 --> 20:02.402
WHY ARE YOU SO OUT OF BREATH?

20:02.435 --> 20:03.403
NOTHING.

20:03.436 --> 20:05.405
OH, WERE YOU, UH--
I LOVE THAT.

20:05.438 --> 20:07.507
I LOVE THAT YOU FEEL SO AT HOME
THAT YOU CAN DO THAT HERE.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.376
WHAT? NO, NO, NO.
I DON'T FEEL AT HOME, OKAY?

20:09.409 --> 20:12.379
IT'S TOO EARLY
TO FEEL AT HOME.

20:12.412 --> 20:13.179
I ACTUALLY GET THAT.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.447
WHEN I FIRST MOVED HERE,
I HATED IT.

20:14.481 --> 20:15.582
THOUGHT IT WAS HAUNTED.

20:15.615 --> 20:17.784
TURNS OUT, IT WAS ACTUALLY
THE WHISTLE THAT MY NOSE MADE

20:17.817 --> 20:19.386
WHILE I SLEPT.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.753
IT'S NOT THAT.

20:20.787 --> 20:23.290
I DON'T THINK YOU REALIZE
WHAT A BIG STEP IT IS FOR ME

20:23.323 --> 20:25.258
TO STAY OVER
AT YOUR APARTMENT.

20:25.292 --> 20:26.192
YEAH, I DON'T.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.395
BECAUSE I PRACTICALLY LIVE
AT YOUR APARTMENT.

20:28.428 --> 20:29.762
DANNY, MY CLOTHES
BASICALLY ALL SMELL

20:29.796 --> 20:30.930
LIKE LEATHER AND VEGETABLES.

20:30.963 --> 20:32.399
LOOK, I WANT TO BE
COMFORTABLE HERE,

20:32.432 --> 20:33.366
I REALLY DO,
BUT I--

20:33.400 --> 20:35.435
I TRIED STAYING
AT ANOTHER GIRL'S APARTMENT,

20:35.468 --> 20:36.803
AND I THOUGHT
IT WAS GONNA BE NICE,

20:36.836 --> 20:38.438
BUT IT TURNED OUT
TO BE AWFUL.

20:38.471 --> 20:40.440
AND NOW YOU'RE PUTTING ALL THIS
PRESSURE ON ME

20:40.473 --> 20:41.708
WITH THESE TIMELINES.

20:41.741 --> 20:42.609
WHAT TIMELINE?

20:42.642 --> 20:44.877
I JUST ASKED IF YOU
WANNA SPEND THE NIGHT.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.045
THAT'S A VERY SHORT TIMELINE.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.715
HEY, UM,
I'M REALLY EXHAUSTED,

20:48.748 --> 20:50.283
AND I HAVE NOT SLEPT
IN TWO DAYS.

20:50.317 --> 20:51.651
SO JUST DECIDE.

20:51.684 --> 20:53.286
DO YOU WANNA STAY
OR DO YOU WANNA GO?

20:57.990 --> 21:01.394
I'M GONNA GO.
OKAY.

21:01.428 --> 21:03.363
ALL RIGHT, GOOD NIGHT.
BYE.

21:22.582 --> 21:25.385
FOR THE LAST TIME,
LOCK YOUR DOOR!

21:25.418 --> 21:26.886
AND KEEP IT LOCKED!

21:26.919 --> 21:28.521

21:28.555 --> 21:30.022
I'M HERE, AREN'T I?

21:30.056 --> 21:32.392
NOW SCOOCH OVER.
YOU'RE ON MY SIDE.
