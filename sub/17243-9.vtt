00:02.539 --> 00:04.306
(Knocking)

00:10.792 --> 00:13.994
Hi, Johnny. Can we come in for a moment?

00:14.029 --> 00:15.395
Yes. Yes.

00:17.331 --> 00:19.733
Thank you. Hello.

00:19.768 --> 00:21.434
Oh, hi.

00:21.469 --> 00:23.336
Is everything okay?

00:23.371 --> 00:25.104
(Emotional) We've got some sad news.

00:25.139 --> 00:28.975
Uh... someone very close has died.

00:29.009 --> 00:31.844
- (Winces) Sorry.
- Oh...

00:31.879 --> 00:34.147
You remember Bob?

00:34.182 --> 00:37.150
No...

00:37.185 --> 00:39.085
You broke into his cabin and had sex

00:39.119 --> 00:42.155
while he and his wife
were in the next room.

00:42.189 --> 00:44.256
Oh... (Realizing) That's Bob.

00:44.291 --> 00:46.559
Yeah, Bob, who was on the town council.

00:46.593 --> 00:49.162
He's on the town council,
yeah... Oh, Bob died?

00:49.196 --> 00:50.963
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

00:50.998 --> 00:53.933
No. No, not Bob. Bob's brother, Carl, died.

00:56.403 --> 00:58.805
(Awkward silence)

01:01.108 --> 01:03.041
I don't know Carl.

01:03.076 --> 01:05.811
We barely know Bob.

01:05.845 --> 01:08.314
Carl thought so highly of you, Johnny.

01:08.348 --> 01:11.483
Oh... really. Well, that's nice.

01:11.518 --> 01:13.285
No, I honestly don't know the man.

01:13.320 --> 01:15.688
Well, understandably, Bob is uh...

01:15.722 --> 01:17.856
Pretty broken up by all of this

01:17.890 --> 01:21.793
and he asked me to ask you
if you'd be willing to um...

01:21.828 --> 01:25.731
be a pallbearer at Carl's funeral.

01:25.765 --> 01:28.466
A pallbearer... Mm-hmm.

01:28.500 --> 01:32.904
at Carl's funeral. Well, I don't, um...

01:32.939 --> 01:35.741
I, you know, I-I'm flattered.

01:35.775 --> 01:37.709
It's-it's quite
an honour to be-

01:37.744 --> 01:39.144
- I knew he would say yes.
- Yeah.

01:39.178 --> 01:41.880
And-and normally I would... I would.

01:41.914 --> 01:44.715
I-I-I, you know, but
my back. I have uh...

01:44.750 --> 01:46.884
I... I-I have back issues.

01:46.918 --> 01:48.352
- Honey? You know, my back.
- What?

01:48.386 --> 01:49.586
- The thing with my back.
- Your back!

01:49.621 --> 01:52.389
Oh, it's... it's terrible.

01:52.423 --> 01:56.260
And his arms are so weak.
Little muscles like corn nuts.

01:56.294 --> 01:58.262
Yeah, yeah, we're just talking
about my back, sweetheart.

01:58.296 --> 02:00.530
It's awful.

02:00.565 --> 02:02.466
I don't know what we're gonna tell Bob.

02:02.500 --> 02:05.236
He's gonna be so disappointed.

02:05.270 --> 02:08.571
Yeah... yeah. Well, life can
kick you in the teeth sometimes.

02:08.604 --> 02:12.008
Mm. Well, that's not gonna help
Bob out too much there, Johnny.

02:12.042 --> 02:14.043
Mm. Yeah. Shouldn't bother Carl.

(Bottles clatter)

02:37.801 --> 02:39.921
(Screaming) I said bring
the goddamn diaper bag!

02:39.936 --> 02:42.871
Uh, babe, I'm getting the cooler right now

02:42.906 --> 02:44.439
in case you didn't notice.

02:44.473 --> 02:45.640
Well, Denim has needed a diaper change

02:45.675 --> 02:47.475
since before we left the house!

02:47.510 --> 02:49.077
Oh my God.

02:49.112 --> 02:50.879
What?

02:50.914 --> 02:53.881
Some townie douchebag
is moving in next door.

02:53.916 --> 02:57.618
They've got a baby.

02:57.652 --> 02:58.219
(Loud blast outside,
David gasps, terrified)

02:58.253 --> 02:59.553
Agh! (Gasps)

02:59.587 --> 03:00.955
Is there a gun?

03:00.989 --> 03:02.423
(Baby wails)

03:02.457 --> 03:03.590
(Frustrated scream)

03:03.625 --> 03:05.993
(Bottle crashes and shatters)

03:06.028 --> 03:07.228
- Oh... no.
- Jesus! What the hell did you

03:07.262 --> 03:09.030
- throw that for?!
- It's still too hot.

03:09.064 --> 03:11.065
It's 20 seconds in the microwave
not 20 minutes, you tool!

03:11.099 --> 03:13.200
You've lost it. You've lost it.

03:13.234 --> 03:16.002
What the hell are you so rattled about?

03:16.037 --> 03:19.539
(Bag thumps loudly, baby wails outside)

03:19.573 --> 03:21.842
- What are you doing?
- Um, I'm gonna go stay at Ted's

03:21.876 --> 03:23.676
because I've been on enough spring breaks

03:23.711 --> 03:27.513
to know how this is gonna
end, and it's not... not good.

03:27.548 --> 03:29.782
You're just gonna leave
me here with these people?!

03:29.817 --> 03:31.751
Yeah. Like I don't feel good about it.

03:31.785 --> 03:34.387
Um, hello! Hello!

03:34.421 --> 03:36.756
Is anybody in that hollow chest?

03:36.790 --> 03:38.358
(Baby wails outside)

03:38.392 --> 03:41.293
(Birds chirp)

03:41.328 --> 03:43.563
(Door opens, door bells jingle)

03:46.467 --> 03:49.935
Hey, Bob. How are you holding up?

03:49.970 --> 03:51.904
Oh... you know. Not bad.

03:54.741 --> 03:56.175
You know, they say death is just life

03:56.209 --> 03:58.377
except you're not here.

03:58.411 --> 04:01.146
You're somewhere else, you know? But...

04:01.181 --> 04:03.815
But that's okay because
at least you're somewhere,

04:03.850 --> 04:04.984
you know? But when does...

04:05.018 --> 04:07.219
When does somewhere become there?

04:07.254 --> 04:09.388
And when does there become here?

04:09.422 --> 04:10.655
- And I... it
- Just, just a coffee, please.

04:10.690 --> 04:11.390
- For here?
- Yeah.

04:11.424 --> 04:12.424
Okay.

04:14.593 --> 04:17.827
(Music plays quietly,
dishes and cutlery clink)

04:20.332 --> 04:22.100
(Gasps) Bob.

04:22.134 --> 04:24.769
- Hi, Johnny.
- Oh, hi... hi.

04:24.803 --> 04:27.138
You mind if I join you?

04:27.172 --> 04:28.873
I could use a little company today.

04:28.908 --> 04:31.509
Oh, no, no. You-you stay where you are

04:31.543 --> 04:34.712
and I'll... I'll come over there.

04:34.746 --> 04:36.213
(Grimacing and grunting) Oh! Ooh, baby.

04:36.247 --> 04:37.782
Ooh, wow. Ugh.

04:40.385 --> 04:44.789
Yikes! That's... That hurts today.

04:44.823 --> 04:48.258
Yeah, Roland, he told me
about your back and I...

04:48.293 --> 04:50.227
I am so sorry.

04:50.261 --> 04:52.662
Well... well, I'm the one who's sorry, Bob.

04:52.696 --> 04:56.800
You know, hearing about your,
uh, brother... C-C-Chris-

04:56.834 --> 04:59.002
- Carl.
- Carl. Yeah, he was a good man.

04:59.037 --> 05:00.703
A good man. He admired you, Johnny.

05:00.738 --> 05:01.805
And I him. Yeah.

05:01.839 --> 05:03.640
And I him.

05:03.674 --> 05:05.875
Listen, uh, I understand about your back...

05:05.910 --> 05:07.978
Yeah... (Grimaces)

05:08.012 --> 05:11.181
And... I was just uh.. Just wondering

05:11.215 --> 05:14.250
if, uh, maybe you could say
a few words at the funeral?

05:14.284 --> 05:16.920
(Coughs)

05:16.954 --> 05:19.322
Well, the thing, uh, the thing is, uh, Bob,

05:19.356 --> 05:22.559
I-I-I don't feel I
deserve that... honor.

05:22.593 --> 05:26.028
Oh, see, I'm uh... I'm
no good at these things.

05:26.063 --> 05:29.231
You know, you, you're... You're polished.

05:29.266 --> 05:31.100
You know, you're... You're well-spoken.

05:31.134 --> 05:33.069
Oh no. No, no. Not really. Not really.

05:33.103 --> 05:35.605
I mean, I'm good one on one,

05:35.639 --> 05:37.539
but not-not good in a public situation.

05:37.574 --> 05:38.941
I clam up pret-pretty good.

05:38.976 --> 05:41.143
As a favor, Johnny.

05:41.178 --> 05:43.245
He must have had a few close friends,

05:43.280 --> 05:46.515
- somebody that
- No one.

05:46.549 --> 05:49.452
Well, sure. Sure. I can
say a few words, Bob.

05:49.486 --> 05:52.721
I'll say a few words.

05:52.755 --> 05:55.824
(Music plays quietly,
approaching footsteps)

05:55.859 --> 05:58.494
Have you seen the couple that checked in?

05:58.528 --> 06:02.531
They're like really scummy.
Like... very skaggy people,

06:02.565 --> 06:05.400
who happened to produce a child

06:05.434 --> 06:07.302
that hasn't been taken away from them yet.

06:07.336 --> 06:08.871
Imagine being related to them.

06:08.905 --> 06:10.639
No, I can't. It's too early.

06:10.673 --> 06:15.210
- They're my cousins.
- Oh! Well, the um...

06:15.244 --> 06:17.545
The baby's relatively normal looking.

06:17.579 --> 06:18.946
No, no they're definitely skaggy.

06:18.981 --> 06:22.282
My God, they're so skaggy.

06:22.317 --> 06:24.418
Hmm. Wait, so you're related to Carl?

06:24.452 --> 06:26.654
Not genetically.

06:26.688 --> 06:30.090
My mom's sister was married to
Carl. Carl is Sean's step-dad.

06:30.125 --> 06:31.526
And was that a factor
in the cause of death?

06:31.560 --> 06:34.094
I wouldn't be surprised.

06:34.129 --> 06:36.530
They broke up just before
Sean got Bree pregnant.

06:36.564 --> 06:38.999
Or someone got Bree pregnant.

06:39.033 --> 06:41.034
I mean, Bree's not exactly fussy

06:41.068 --> 06:44.037
when it comes to introducing
men to her vagina.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.471
Mm. Charming.

06:45.506 --> 06:48.241
(Car rumbles by)

06:48.275 --> 06:50.877
(Bag thumps on chair)

06:50.912 --> 06:53.947
Tell me it's not always this clean in here.

06:53.981 --> 06:55.015
No, it's-it's always this clean.

06:55.049 --> 06:57.716
Oh... it smells so fresh!

06:57.751 --> 06:59.585
Uh... that's the Febreeze.

06:59.619 --> 07:01.787
I was... I was eating
Indian last night, so...

07:01.821 --> 07:04.323
So much better than the motel.

07:04.358 --> 07:07.026
At least you know what the smell is.

07:07.061 --> 07:08.994
(Squeals happily)

07:09.029 --> 07:10.029
(Kissing)

07:12.732 --> 07:14.100
(Paws skitter across on floor)

07:14.134 --> 07:15.900
Oh, ho-oh! Oh... (Laughs)

07:15.935 --> 07:18.002
Hey, come on now, you two, Oh, hi! Hi.

07:18.037 --> 07:20.638
- Come on.
- Hi there. Ooh!

07:20.673 --> 07:24.042
Oh-ho-ho... there's a good
girl. There's a good girl!

07:24.077 --> 07:27.845
- They're so...
- Well, Macy and Fifer are just staying with me

07:27.880 --> 07:29.314
for a couple of weeks until
they get back on their feet.

07:29.348 --> 07:31.283
Isn't that right, Fifey?

07:31.317 --> 07:33.518
Yeah, your worms are almost
all gone, aren't they?

07:33.553 --> 07:35.419
Yeah...

07:35.454 --> 07:37.521
Is that a diaper on that little cutie?

07:37.556 --> 07:40.691
Yup. Oh! You know what though? Whoa
-'kay. This is just...

07:40.725 --> 07:42.759
This is because she's...
She's... She's scared right now.

07:42.794 --> 07:44.295
But don't worry.

07:44.329 --> 07:46.330
I can tell that you
are gonna win them over.

07:46.364 --> 07:48.566
- Yeah... ?
- Yeah.

07:48.600 --> 07:51.935
I just-I haven't um...
been... I haven't-I don't-

07:51.970 --> 07:53.769
I'm not around dogs a lot,
so... (Laughs nervously)

07:53.804 --> 07:54.670
No, you know what? Don't even worry about.

07:54.705 --> 07:56.906
Just... for tonight,

07:56.940 --> 07:59.476
think of them as... our kids. (Dogs pant)

07:59.510 --> 08:02.378
Right? Oh yeah...

08:02.413 --> 08:04.481
John, you're speaking at the funeral?

08:04.515 --> 08:07.217
The man was weeping.
What was I supposed to do?

08:07.251 --> 08:08.884
You take his hands in yours,

08:08.919 --> 08:12.154
you look him in the eye, and say, "no."

08:12.188 --> 08:14.823
What do you say about guy
you couldn't care less about?

08:14.857 --> 08:17.593
Oh, it's Gord what's-his-name's
funeral all over again.

08:17.627 --> 08:18.827
- Who's Gord
what's-his-name? - Exactly.

08:18.861 --> 08:21.430
He was some kind of
crew-person on Sunrise Bay.

08:21.464 --> 08:24.833
I made an obligatory
appearance at the service

08:24.867 --> 08:27.503
and his hysterical girlfriend
cornered me into saying a few words.

08:27.537 --> 08:28.897
I didn't have a thought in my head,

08:28.904 --> 08:30.472
so I just stood up and sang "Danny Boy."

08:30.507 --> 08:31.839
Not a dry eye in the house.

08:31.873 --> 08:32.905
Huh...

08:32.941 --> 08:35.676
(Crickets chirp)

08:35.710 --> 08:37.345
God, I love this bed.

08:40.448 --> 08:42.549
I'm so glad you're not my brother.

08:42.583 --> 08:45.453
Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty glad about that too.

08:45.487 --> 08:48.489
But let me assure you,
tonight it is just you and me.

08:48.524 --> 08:49.723
(Happy sigh)

08:49.758 --> 08:51.058
(Kissing)

08:54.828 --> 08:57.096
(Playful giggle, gasping)

08:57.131 --> 09:00.667
(Kissing)

09:00.701 --> 09:02.602
(Panting) Um...

09:02.637 --> 09:05.838
Hey, the little guy is looking at us.

09:05.873 --> 09:09.209
Oh, yeah, dogs sometimes do that.

09:09.243 --> 09:10.910
(Kissing)

09:12.813 --> 09:14.314
(Panting)

09:16.950 --> 09:21.421
Um... maybe we could
invite it to... go? Go away.

09:21.455 --> 09:23.723
Oh, she's fine. She's fine. She's fine.

09:23.757 --> 09:25.524
(Kissing)

09:25.559 --> 09:27.994
(Collar jingles)

09:28.028 --> 09:31.163
Oh, now you want in on
the action, too, huh?

09:31.197 --> 09:34.800
Okay, the... the big one
is sniffing the diaper.

09:34.834 --> 09:36.534
Does... does that mean it's full?

09:36.569 --> 09:38.103
- Okay.
- What is... ?

09:38.137 --> 09:40.939
Okay, you guys, just give
us a little bit of time here

09:40.973 --> 09:44.209
and then you can come
sleep with us, okay? Okay?

09:44.243 --> 09:46.044
Okay, where were we?

09:46.079 --> 09:47.713
- Hmm...
- Mm...

09:47.747 --> 09:50.215
(Kissing, dogs start growling)

09:50.249 --> 09:52.483
(Barking)

09:52.518 --> 09:55.153
(Mouthing) Out! Out!

09:55.188 --> 09:58.388
(Dogs continue barking)

09:58.423 --> 10:01.826
(Loud rock music plays,
people chatter and laugh)

10:01.860 --> 10:03.961
Pass the chips!

10:03.995 --> 10:06.363
(Beer bottles clink)

10:06.397 --> 10:08.298
(Knocking) Hello. Excuse me.

10:08.333 --> 10:09.499
(Loudly) Excuse me!

10:09.534 --> 10:10.901
- Hey!
- Excuse me!

10:10.936 --> 10:13.170
- Hey! Go.
- Excuse me, hi.

10:13.205 --> 10:14.872
Oh, Buttons,

10:14.906 --> 10:16.540
I don't think you're
invited to this one, huh?

10:16.574 --> 10:18.474
I don't wanna be invited to this one.

10:18.508 --> 10:19.743
(Laughing) Hey, look
who it is. It's your dad.

10:19.777 --> 10:21.211
- He's here to take you home!
- Yeah, yeah...

10:21.245 --> 10:23.813
- Remember that?!
- Yeah! (Laughs)

10:23.848 --> 10:24.547
You remember that one?! (Laughing)

10:24.581 --> 10:27.083
No.

10:27.118 --> 10:29.152
- I'm just pumpin' your tires, bud!
- Okay.

10:29.186 --> 10:31.020
Look, what you gotta understand

10:31.055 --> 10:33.322
is that my ex-stepdad just died,

10:33.357 --> 10:35.859
so we're here celebrating his life, okay?

10:35.893 --> 10:38.261
Okay, you all seem very devastated by this.

10:38.295 --> 10:40.296
I need you to turn-mm.

10:40.330 --> 10:43.866
I need you to turn the music down, okay?

10:43.900 --> 10:47.536
Because I-I'm trying to get
couple hours... Sleep tonight.

10:47.571 --> 10:50.906
Oh, sleep? Well, you know
who's sleeping forever, bud?

10:50.940 --> 10:52.642
- Your ex-stepdad, yeah.
- My ex-stepdad, yeah.

10:52.676 --> 10:55.210
- Yup, yeah.
- Damn, that's sad...

10:55.245 --> 10:57.012
- Okay, thank you. If you could just turn it..
- Are we out of mix?

10:57.046 --> 10:58.713
Thank you.

11:00.917 --> 11:03.152
Oh my God.

11:03.186 --> 11:04.552
(Drunkenly) Don't...

11:04.587 --> 11:08.556
Oh my... (Mouths) Oh my God!

11:08.591 --> 11:10.025
I am so sorry. They got me...

11:12.162 --> 11:13.395
(Drunk whisper) They got me wasted.

11:13.429 --> 11:15.264
- Mm-hmm. - I
hate them, okay?

11:15.298 --> 11:17.432
I hate them so much.

11:17.466 --> 11:21.035
You smell... very flammable right now.

11:21.069 --> 11:23.337
Yes, I'm sure...

11:23.371 --> 11:27.374
I'm gonna need you to get
them to turn it down, okay?

11:27.409 --> 11:29.177
- Yes!
- Yeah.

11:29.211 --> 11:31.345
(Music plays loudly, Sean laughs)

11:31.379 --> 11:34.615
- Hi, Denim.
- Hi, sweetie pie.

11:34.649 --> 11:36.550
David, I so sorry.

11:49.623 --> 11:51.024
- Johnny.
- Hello, Bob.

11:51.058 --> 11:53.659
Moira, so good of you to come.

11:53.694 --> 11:56.596
John said we had no choice.

11:56.630 --> 11:58.031
Listen, we have some good seats down front.

11:58.065 --> 11:59.185
Oh, that's very nice.

12:01.568 --> 12:05.337
Boy, what a beautiful day for a... funeral.

12:09.042 --> 12:11.243
(Low murmurs, organ music plays)

12:15.039 --> 12:18.408
Bob... in case I wanna
mention this in my remarks,

12:18.442 --> 12:20.775
how-how did Carl go?

12:20.810 --> 12:24.246
Well, it was a bit of a
freak accident, really.

12:24.280 --> 12:27.615
Apparently, he was trying to
unhook his belt from the ceiling fan

12:27.650 --> 12:31.086
and... apparently it... It
got knotted around his neck.

12:31.120 --> 12:32.854
(Alarmed) What?

12:32.888 --> 12:34.156
Yeah, you know, you'd think the whole thing

12:34.190 --> 12:36.391
would've come down, you know,

12:36.426 --> 12:41.662
keeping a fan and a body
spinning up there for two days.

12:41.696 --> 12:45.032
But uh... Carl found the studs on that one.

12:45.067 --> 12:46.867
Oh...  Yeah... (Chuckles)

12:46.901 --> 12:47.969
That's craftsmanship.

12:48.003 --> 12:50.104
Oh, yeah.

12:50.138 --> 12:53.007
But that uh... That was Carl.

12:53.041 --> 12:55.309
(Organ music plays,
mourners murmur quietly)

12:58.879 --> 13:00.947
(Birds chirp)

13:00.982 --> 13:03.483
Do you even know what that stain is or... ?

13:03.517 --> 13:06.386
Uh... I'm worried if I
did, I wouldn't clean it up.

13:08.922 --> 13:11.257
Why are you cleaning it up?

13:11.292 --> 13:16.029
Sadly, um, I threw most of
the broken glass you see here.

13:16.063 --> 13:18.097
You were a bit of a mess last night.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.831
They told you?

13:19.866 --> 13:22.968
Oh, no, no. We had a
full-blown conversation.

13:23.003 --> 13:25.537
You were barely clinging to consciousness.

13:25.571 --> 13:28.572
Oh. Sorry.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.877
Did I try and make out with you?

13:31.911 --> 13:34.746
- Mm-mm.
- Good.

13:34.780 --> 13:37.149
But now I'm worried I
made out with someone else.

13:37.183 --> 13:39.551
Uh, it's kind of my go-to
when I'm a little boozy.

13:39.585 --> 13:43.287
Mm. Mine's shame eating,
so yours sounds more fun.

13:43.322 --> 13:45.089
(Laughs)

13:45.124 --> 13:46.590
Huh. (Chuckles)

13:46.625 --> 13:49.227
Um...

13:49.261 --> 13:51.062
Is this your thong or... ?

13:51.096 --> 13:55.233
Yeah, no. Bree's a real classy girl.

13:55.267 --> 13:57.535
Uh, his was wrapped around the remote.

13:57.569 --> 13:59.170
Don't worry, I threw out the remote.

13:59.204 --> 14:00.638
Hmm.

14:02.874 --> 14:04.508
Well, it looks like
they have a side hustle.

14:04.543 --> 14:07.945
Uh, I'm pretty sure she strips. Why?

14:07.979 --> 14:10.113
Oh no, this is just a lot of um...

14:10.148 --> 14:13.283
- Yes, it is.
- Marijuana. (Sniffs)

14:13.317 --> 14:15.586
And if you're offering, my answer is yes.

14:15.620 --> 14:17.021
(Bag rustles)

14:22.193 --> 14:24.528
Thank you for that, Shannon.

14:24.562 --> 14:28.097
Nothing says we'll miss you like
an excerpt from "Breaking Dawn,"

14:28.131 --> 14:30.466
one of Carl's favourites
of the Twilight movies.

14:30.500 --> 14:31.634
(Mourner cries, baby wails)

14:31.669 --> 14:34.303
Now, to say a few words,

14:34.337 --> 14:36.272
I'd like to bring up a close friend

14:36.306 --> 14:38.140
and one of Carl's personal heroes...

14:38.175 --> 14:39.943
(Baby wails)

14:39.977 --> 14:41.510
Johnny Rose. (Mourners clap and murmur)

14:44.747 --> 14:46.848
(Baby wails, mourner coughs)

14:50.053 --> 14:51.587
Thank you... minister.

14:53.656 --> 14:57.059
Carl...

14:57.093 --> 14:58.526
What to say about Carl... ?

15:00.997 --> 15:04.299
Once so full of life

15:04.333 --> 15:07.735
and now... lying... very, very close to me.

15:10.038 --> 15:11.706
What a terrible thing death is...

15:14.076 --> 15:17.078
And yet, for Carl,

15:17.112 --> 15:19.113
pretty much an all-consuming
thing at this point.

15:19.147 --> 15:21.048
(Mourner cries)

15:21.083 --> 15:23.084
He-he was a- he was
a man who loved...

15:25.186 --> 15:26.553
A good sweater I'm told.

15:29.056 --> 15:31.558
And-and he loved the feel
of big tool in his hand,

15:31.593 --> 15:34.161
am I right, Bob?

15:34.195 --> 15:36.563
And I wonder,

15:36.598 --> 15:40.199
when Carl was spinning
around on that ceiling fan

15:40.234 --> 15:42.935
that he was so very proud of,

15:42.969 --> 15:46.539
was he ever thinking of this town...

15:46.573 --> 15:49.342
where he was born where he lived,

15:49.376 --> 15:51.477
and where he died... Where he died.

15:55.382 --> 15:58.484
But I-I-I'm not
up here today

15:58.519 --> 16:02.720
to speak about dying in Schitt's Creek.

16:02.755 --> 16:06.991
(Cell phone rings)
I'm-I'm here-I'm-

16:07.026 --> 16:09.327
(Phone beeps on) (Bleep!)
Where the hell are you, Sean?!

16:09.362 --> 16:11.630
At a bar?!

16:11.664 --> 16:13.298
If anyone should be in
a bar right now, it's me.

16:13.332 --> 16:14.732
(Baby wails)

16:14.767 --> 16:17.169
(Bleep) Sean! (Mourners gasp)

16:17.203 --> 16:21.540
(Baby wails) Excuse me.

16:21.574 --> 16:25.075
Well... I-I am here to talk
about dying in Schitt's Creek!

16:25.109 --> 16:28.679
I'm here to talk about the
misery of our lives here

16:28.713 --> 16:31.715
and how we might never escape this place,

16:31.749 --> 16:34.652
and how we do not wanna end
up in a coffin, like Carl,

16:34.686 --> 16:37.754
here in this... godforsaken-

16:37.789 --> 16:41.158

16:43.461 --> 16:48.799
♪ the pipes, the pipes are calling... ♪

17:06.281 --> 17:08.050
(Birds chirp)

17:08.085 --> 17:11.220
So... I'm sorry

17:11.253 --> 17:15.290
if, earlier, I wasn't
sensitive to your animal issues.

17:15.325 --> 17:18.060
And if it's any consolation,
the dogs told me to tell you

17:18.095 --> 17:22.330
that they're super embarrassed
about their behaviour, too.

17:22.365 --> 17:25.767
Well, I am dating a vet.
I should've known that...

17:25.800 --> 17:28.136
There'd be slutty little
animals running around.

17:28.170 --> 17:30.004
And I only take in the slutty ones, so...

17:30.039 --> 17:31.672
(Laughs)

17:31.707 --> 17:33.374
I just... I didn't know what to do

17:33.408 --> 17:36.377
because I love the dogs so much, but...

17:36.411 --> 17:40.949
You know, I also really love...

17:40.983 --> 17:45.653
The way that our relationship
is going right now... so much.

17:45.687 --> 17:48.155
Mm... such a sweet face. (Both laugh)

17:48.189 --> 17:50.691
So, to get you more
comfortable around animals...

17:50.726 --> 17:52.693
Not a puppy, Ted! I...

17:52.728 --> 17:54.328
No, that would be cruel to the puppy.

17:54.363 --> 17:56.697
No, I got you... this.

17:59.434 --> 18:01.969
"Opening your heart to
animals: A guide to the benefits

18:02.003 --> 18:05.038
of caring for something
other than yourself."

18:05.073 --> 18:06.774
It's a very specific book.

18:06.808 --> 18:09.843
You might wanna check out page 37.

18:09.878 --> 18:10.878
(Pages flip)

18:13.047 --> 18:14.681
(Whispers excitedly) Is it a credit card?

18:14.715 --> 18:17.651
No. It's a room key...

18:17.685 --> 18:20.320
To the premium king suite

18:20.354 --> 18:22.389
at the Holiday Inn Express in Elmdale,

18:22.423 --> 18:25.125
and they have a very strict
no pets allowed policy.

18:25.160 --> 18:27.660
Well... it just so happens

18:27.694 --> 18:30.062
that I have packed my overnight bag.

18:30.097 --> 18:32.165
- Hmm.
- Come here.

18:32.199 --> 18:35.101
(Kiss)

18:35.135 --> 18:36.702
- Thank you.
- No. Thank you.

18:36.736 --> 18:38.137
- No. Thank you!
- Thank you.

18:38.172 --> 18:38.871
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

18:38.906 --> 18:39.906
Thank you!

18:39.940 --> 18:41.473
(Bird chirp)

18:44.211 --> 18:45.477
You know where I got my hat, brah?

18:45.512 --> 18:47.179
Where?

18:47.213 --> 18:49.281
"Assholes' R 'Us".

18:49.315 --> 18:51.116
(Both giggle)

18:51.150 --> 18:53.584
(Laughing)

18:57.056 --> 18:59.191
(Car doors bang shut outside) Oh! Ow!

18:59.225 --> 19:01.759
(Baby wails outside) Oh! Oh my God.

19:01.794 --> 19:03.829
Oh my God! We need to go.

19:03.863 --> 19:05.830
We need to go! We need to go!

19:08.333 --> 19:10.400
(Panicked whisper) I don't
see it... I don't see it.

19:10.435 --> 19:11.501
- Let me see
it- - Shhh...

19:11.536 --> 19:13.437
(Keys jingle, lock tumbles)

19:13.471 --> 19:14.604
(Panicked breaths)

19:16.908 --> 19:18.342
(Door bangs shut, baby wails)

19:18.376 --> 19:19.977
The (Bleep)?!

19:20.011 --> 19:21.651
Shhhhhh!  (Stifled laughter)

19:26.084 --> 19:27.784
(Whispering) My hat.. I'm wearing it.

19:27.819 --> 19:29.052
I'm wearing it...

19:29.086 --> 19:30.753
(Stifles a laugh)

19:30.787 --> 19:32.488
(Both laughing)

19:34.825 --> 19:36.159
(Kissing, Stevie slams into door)

19:36.193 --> 19:38.033
(Beer bottle scrape door,
Stevie grunts softly)

19:38.996 --> 19:41.464
(Panting and kissing)

19:44.034 --> 19:44.767
(Crash)

19:54.111 --> 19:55.344
So I'm thinking to myself,

19:55.378 --> 19:57.814
"Oh, God, what if die here?"

19:57.848 --> 20:01.184
Mm. That was not lost on anyone.

20:01.218 --> 20:03.152
Uh, let's pilfer a few sandwiches

20:03.187 --> 20:04.753
and make a gracious French exit.

20:04.788 --> 20:06.588
Good idea.

20:10.193 --> 20:14.661
Moira! Your "Danny Boy"... What a voice.

20:14.964 --> 20:16.665
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

20:16.700 --> 20:18.834
I-I'd really like you to
sing at my cousin's funeral.

20:18.868 --> 20:20.336
She's not dead, but...

20:20.370 --> 20:23.372
She's been coughing a lot lately.

20:23.406 --> 20:25.808
Moira, before they close the coffin,

20:25.842 --> 20:28.210
One more chorus for Carl?

20:28.244 --> 20:30.511
Please?

20:30.546 --> 20:31.912
(Chuckles awkwardly)

20:31.947 --> 20:34.915

Pineapples, pig on the spit,

the whole nine yards.

Oh, you, uh, roast pig?
