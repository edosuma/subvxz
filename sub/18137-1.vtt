05:39.924 --> 05:43.260
WHY DO THEY ALWAYS
SOUND SO MANY TRUMPETS?

05:43.344 --> 05:44.678
I'M NOT JEHOVAH.

05:46.430 --> 05:49.099
WHY CAN'T A PRINCE
COME HOME WITHOUT A FUSS?

05:49.183 --> 05:52.603
PRESUMABLY BECAUSE
HE IS A PRINCE, SIR.

05:52.645 --> 05:54.480
OTHER PEOPLE CAN SNEAK IN
THE BACK WAY UNANNOUNCED,

05:54.605 --> 05:56.857
WHICH IS HOW
IT SHOULD BE.

05:56.941 --> 05:58.108
WHAT ARE YOU
SMILING AT?

05:58.192 --> 05:59.860
OH, WAS
I SMILING, SIR?

05:59.902 --> 06:02.863
JUST THE SUDDEN WARMTH
CRACKING MY FACE.

06:07.409 --> 06:11.330
A PRINCE'S LOT IS
NOTHING MORE THAN A BORE.

06:11.413 --> 06:14.124
YOUR FACE CRACKS
RATHER EASILY, DOESN'T IT?

06:14.166 --> 06:15.417
NOW, YOU MARK
MY WORDS,

06:15.501 --> 06:16.835
BEFORE YOU
CAN COUNT TO 10,

06:16.877 --> 06:19.046
THROUGH THAT DOOR,
WITH THE ODIOUS PUNCTUALITY

06:19.129 --> 06:20.506
OF OUR NEIGHBOR'S
MUCH VAUNTED,

06:20.589 --> 06:23.050
RECENTLY INVENTED, HIDEOUSLY
IRRITATING CUCKOO CLOCK,

06:23.133 --> 06:25.177
WILL COME OUR DEAR
AND LOYAL SUBJECT,

06:25.219 --> 06:28.264
THE EVER-UNCTUOUS
LORD HIGH CHAMBERLAIN.

06:28.305 --> 06:30.432
5, 6...

06:30.474 --> 06:32.893
Man: 7!

06:32.977 --> 06:34.228
HE'S IMPROVING.

06:34.270 --> 06:36.230
ONE OF THESE DAYS,
HE'S GOING TO ACHIEVE

06:36.313 --> 06:37.731
THE ELUSIVE
10-MINUTE MILE.

06:37.815 --> 06:38.774
HA HA HA HA!

06:38.816 --> 06:45.072
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.
AH, WELCOME HOME.

06:45.114 --> 06:47.783
WELCOME HOME,
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.

06:47.866 --> 06:49.785
MY LORD HIGH CHAMBERLAIN,

06:49.827 --> 06:51.370
WHAT AN UNEXPECTED
PLEASURE.

06:51.453 --> 06:52.413
I AM COMMANDED BY

06:52.496 --> 06:54.415
HIS MAJESTY THE KING,
YOUR FATHER,

06:54.498 --> 06:56.417
AND HER MAJESTY
THE QUEEN, YOUR MOTHER--

06:56.500 --> 06:57.668
YES, YES, NOW,
DON'T TIRE YOURSELF,

06:57.710 --> 06:59.044
I AM ACQUAINTED
WITH THEM.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.671
HOW ARE MY
DOTING PARENTS?

07:00.754 --> 07:03.507
THEIR MAJESTIES ARE NATURALLY
MOST ANXIOUS TO HEAR

07:03.549 --> 07:05.759
SUCH GLAD TIDINGS
I FEEL SURE YOU BEAR

07:05.801 --> 07:08.220
CONCERNING YOUR RECENT
ABSENCE FROM THE COURT.

07:08.304 --> 07:10.889
NAMELY, THE MATTER
OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF

07:10.931 --> 07:14.184
AND BETROTHAL TO THE PRINCESS
SELINA OF CAROLSFELD.

07:14.226 --> 07:18.105
INDEED, IN ANTICIPATION
OF SUCH WONDERFUL NEWS,

07:18.188 --> 07:20.190
HIS MAJESTY THE KING
HAS DECIDED TO MAKE YOU

07:20.232 --> 07:22.401
A KNIGHT GRAND CROSS

07:22.484 --> 07:25.863
OF THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS ORDER
OF SAINT DAVID THE MARTYR.

07:25.904 --> 07:28.198
WHICH IS USUALLY
AWARDED POSTHUMOUSLY.

07:28.282 --> 07:30.117
A SUITABLE HONOR,
AS IT HAPPENS,

07:30.200 --> 07:33.495
FOR THE MATTER OF MY BETROTHAL
IS VERY STATUS QUO.

07:33.537 --> 07:35.956
I DID NOT FIND THE LADY OF
YOUR CHOICE TO BE MY CHOICE.

07:36.040 --> 07:38.125
OH, BUT, SIR--
WE ARE RETURNED...

07:38.208 --> 07:39.877
AS WE DEPARTED.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.212
THE KING I'M SURE,
AND INDEED MY DEAR MAMA

07:42.254 --> 07:43.923
WILL SHARE
YOUR NOTICEABLE GRIEF.

07:44.006 --> 07:46.342
Chamberlain: INDEED, SIR,
THE WHOLE COURT WILL BE GRIEVED.

07:46.383 --> 07:47.676
WELL, SO BE IT.

07:47.718 --> 07:51.305
ANY SIMPLE PEASANT IS
AFFORDED THE ABILITY

07:51.388 --> 07:55.267
IN LOVE...
TO WIN OR LOSE

07:55.309 --> 07:59.563
WHILE I OF THE NOBILITY
AM ROBBED OF THE FACILITY

07:59.605 --> 08:02.024
TO CHOOSE

08:03.567 --> 08:07.363
ANY SERF OR SERVANT
CAN BY NATURAL SELECTION

08:07.404 --> 08:11.200
ELECT HIMSELF A MATE
IF SHE'S AMENABLE

08:11.241 --> 08:15.204
BUT DUE TO MY HIGH BREEDING,
I'M CONTINUALLY ACCEDING

08:15.245 --> 08:18.249
TO DEMANDS
I FIND INCREASINGLY

08:18.290 --> 08:20.542
UNTENABLE

08:20.584 --> 08:23.879
ALL I ASK, AND IT'S A
SIMPLE ENOUGH REQUEST--

08:23.963 --> 08:25.923
WELL, FOLLOW ME,
BY ALL MEANS, FOLLOW ME.

08:28.759 --> 08:32.346
I WISH TO KNOW,
I DEMAND TO KNOW...

08:32.429 --> 08:36.225
WHY CAN'T I BE
TWO PEOPLE?

08:36.267 --> 08:40.520
WHY CAN'T I LIVE
TWO ROLES?

08:40.604 --> 08:44.900
WHY CAN'T ONE OF ME PERFORM
ALL THE CLOYING AMENITIES TI

08:44.942 --> 08:46.735
WHILE THE OTHER ME,
TWIN BROTHER ME

08:46.777 --> 08:48.612
BE A FREE AND HAPPY SOUL?</>

08:48.696 --> 08:52.408
WHY CAN'T I BE
TWO PEOPLE?

08:52.449 --> 08:56.453
SPLIT MYSELF RIGHT IN HALF

08:56.495 --> 08:58.914
THEN I COULD SATISFY
AND MOLLIFY

08:58.956 --> 09:02.126
AND PACIFY AND QUALIFY

09:02.167 --> 09:04.336
WHILE THE OTHER ME
WOULD HAVE

09:04.420 --> 09:07.006
A HELL OF
A HEALTHY LAUGH, HA? '11

09:10.467 --> 09:14.179
THE CUSTOM OF ROYALTY
IN REFERRING TO ONESELF

09:14.221 --> 09:18.642
IS TO NATURALLY EMPLOY
THE ROYAL "WE“

09:18.726 --> 09:20.477
"WE ARE VERY HAPPY" SI

09:20.561 --> 09:22.646
Y, “WE ARE VERY SAD“ “I

09:22.688 --> 09:26.817
“WE ARE BORED
AND SUFFER FROM ENNUI"

09:26.859 --> 09:30.154
FOR A ROYAL PRINCE,
THERE'S NO SUCH WORD AS “ME"

09:30.237 --> 09:32.781
IT'S ALWAYS "WE“

09:32.823 --> 09:38.329
SO, RIGHTFULLY, I
SHOULD BE TWO on THREE

09:38.370 --> 09:39.496
DON'T YOU AGREE?

09:39.580 --> 09:41.916
IT'S NOT FOR ME TO SAY,
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.

09:41.999 --> 09:43.167
PERHAPS NOT.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.711
SO, I ASK MYSELF...

09:45.794 --> 09:49.632
WHY CAN'T I BE
TWO PEOPLE?

09:49.673 --> 09:53.761
WHY CAN'T I PLAY
TWO PARTS?

09:53.844 --> 09:57.890
WHY CAN'T ONE OF ME ENDURE
THE APPALLING FORMALITIES

09:57.932 --> 10:00.059
WHILE THE OTHER ME,
TWIN BROTHER ME

10:00.100 --> 10:01.852
HAVE A FREE
AND HAPPY HEART?

10:01.936 --> 10:05.606
IF I COULD BE
TWO PEOPLE

10:05.689 --> 10:09.902
LIFE WOULD NOT
PASS ME BY

10:09.944 --> 10:13.447
I'D HAVE A CHANCE
TO PICK AND CHOOSE

10:13.530 --> 10:16.742
I'D HAVE A CHANCE
TO WIN OR LOSE

10:16.784 --> 10:22.539
AND MAYBE ONE OF US
WOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO LIVE...

10:22.581 --> 10:24.416
BEFORE WE DIE!

10:24.500 --> 10:27.586
DIE? WHO'S DIED?

10:27.670 --> 10:31.131
AH! AT LAST!
OUR DEAR SON.

10:31.215 --> 10:34.093
WE ARE... WE ARE...
WE'RE WHAT?

10:34.134 --> 10:35.469
DELIGHTED.

10:35.552 --> 10:39.014
YES, DELIGHTED
TO SEE YOU RETURN.

10:39.056 --> 10:40.057
OH!

10:40.099 --> 10:43.102
AH, YES, I HAVE
SOMETHING FOR YOU.

10:43.185 --> 10:44.812
Prince: FATHER...

10:44.895 --> 10:45.854
Chamberlain:
YOUR MAJESTY--

10:45.896 --> 10:46.855
KNEEL, SIR.

10:46.897 --> 10:48.065
FATHER.

10:48.148 --> 10:51.777
I DO NOT WISH" IT WOULD
BE MOST INAPPROPRIATE...

10:51.860 --> 10:53.696
YOUR MAJESTY, HIS ROYAL
HIGHNESS HAS RETURNED--

10:53.737 --> 10:56.198
OF COURSE HE'S RETURNED! YOU
GET MORE SENILE EVERY DAY.

10:56.240 --> 10:57.283
I HAVE RETURNED,
FATHER--

10:57.366 --> 10:58.284
NOW YOU' RE
CATCHING IT.

10:58.367 --> 10:59.785
EMPTY-HANDED.
KNEEL, SIR.

10:59.910 --> 11:01.036
FATHER, THIS IS
MOST EMIBARRASSING.

11:01.078 --> 11:02.746
I COMMAND YOU
TO KNEEL, SIR!

11:02.788 --> 11:04.415
I DON'T DESERVE IT.
I HAVEN'T EARNED IT.

11:04.498 --> 11:05.708
NOBODY EARNS THIS.

11:05.791 --> 11:07.209
IT'S GIVEN BECAUSE I AM
THE KING AND I LIKE IT.

11:07.293 --> 11:08.335
WHERE'S MY SWORD?

11:10.254 --> 11:11.839
AH! IT'S FAR
TOO HEAVY.

11:11.922 --> 11:13.507
YOU KNOW, I WAS BORN WITH THE
CURSE OF THE WEAK WRISTS.

11:13.591 --> 11:16.635
OH, I DO SO LOVE
A CEREMONY.

11:16.719 --> 11:19.263
AH, THAT'S BETTER.
I DUB THEE--

11:19.305 --> 11:22.349
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.

11:22.433 --> 11:23.642
SHOULDN'T THERE BE
SOMETHING BEFORE THAT?

11:23.726 --> 11:25.352
YES, INDEED, SIRE.
I HAVE IT HERE.

11:25.436 --> 11:27.980
YOUR MAJESTY--FATHER,
DO WE--MUST I--

11:28.063 --> 11:29.356
us, or COURSE,
YOU MUST. AHEM!

11:32.735 --> 11:35.321
“LET IT BE KNOWN
TO ALL HERE PRESENT

11:35.404 --> 11:38.616
“THAT BY OUR COMMAND
HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS,

11:38.699 --> 11:39.867
“THE PRINCE

11:39.950 --> 11:42.202
"ALBERT GEORGE JAMES
RICHARD AUGUSTUS PHILIP

HAS RECEIVED
OUR GRACIOUS FAVOR.“

11:44.872 --> 11:46.624
ER... WHO WROTE THIS?

11:46.665 --> 11:47.583
YOU DID, SIRE.

11:47.666 --> 11:50.252
AH, YES, WELL,
IT'S MAGNIFICENT STUFF.

11:50.294 --> 11:52.004
WELL WORTH
PAYING ATTENTION TO.

11:52.087 --> 11:55.090
“FROM THIS DAY HENCEFORTH
SHALL BE ENTITLED

11:55.132 --> 11:57.968
"TO BE KNOWN AS
A KNIGHT GRAND CROSS

11:58.052 --> 12:02.222
OF THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS ORDER OF
SAINT DAVID THE BLESSED MARTYR. "

12:04.642 --> 12:08.479
THERE'S... SOMEBODY
IN THE ROOM!

12:14.693 --> 12:16.779
VERY FINE. NOW I KISS
YOU ON BOTH CHEEKS.

12:16.820 --> 12:19.073
THAT'S THE PART
I LIKE BEST.

12:19.156 --> 12:22.117
I SOMETIMES GIVE MEDALS
TO A WHOLE REGIMENT.

12:22.201 --> 12:23.702
GOOD. VERY
TOUCHING CEREMONY.

12:23.786 --> 12:25.120
Chamberlain:
MOST TOUCHING, SIRE.

12:25.162 --> 12:26.121
SYCOPHANT!

12:26.205 --> 12:28.707
DON'T ALWAYS HAVE
TO AGREE, YOU KNOW.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.960
CONGRATULATIONS,
DEAR COUSIN.

12:31.001 --> 12:34.046
OH, LORD!
WHO LET HIM IN?

12:34.088 --> 12:38.217
CONGRATULATIONS !
I HEARD ALL THE TRUMPETS.

12:38.259 --> 12:40.177
NOW, DON'T YOU START.

12:40.219 --> 12:42.096
OH! A LITTLE
PREMATURE, AM I?

12:42.179 --> 12:45.224
I SAY, HAVE I DROPPED THE
TINIEST OF SOCIAL BRICKETTES?

12:45.266 --> 12:46.976
I MEAN, I WAS BEING
QUITE SINCERE.

12:47.059 --> 12:50.354
WELL, YOU KNOW, AS
SINCERE AS I EVER AM.

12:50.396 --> 12:51.397
OH, no!

12:51.480 --> 12:55.067
WHO IS IT? HAS THERE BEEN
AN UPRISING?

12:55.109 --> 12:57.820
NO, YOUR MAJESTY. IT'S
JUST THE DUKE OF MONTAGUE.

12:57.861 --> 12:59.780
IS HE STILL ALIVE?

12:59.863 --> 13:02.950
I THOUGHT WE BURIED HIM.

13:03.033 --> 13:05.244
FATHER, EVER SINCE
I ENTERED THIS ROOM,

13:05.286 --> 13:06.287
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO TELL YOU THAT

13:06.370 --> 13:09.748
WHAT YOU EXPECTED OF ME
DID NOT TAKE PLACE.

13:13.294 --> 13:15.212
MY THROW, I THINK.

13:15.296 --> 13:17.881
No, IT'S NOT.
YOU'RE CHEATING AGAIN.

13:17.923 --> 13:20.551
KINGS NEVER CHEAT. THEY
ADAPT TO CIRCUMSTANCES,

13:20.593 --> 13:23.387
BUT THEY NEVER CHEAT.

13:23.470 --> 13:24.555
IF I MAY, SIR,
BY roux LEAVE,

13:24.638 --> 13:26.390
THIS THING
IS CHOKING ME.

13:26.473 --> 13:27.641
YOU SEE HOW
I'M PLACED?

13:27.725 --> 13:29.435
ACCUSED IN FRONT OF THE
COURT BY MY OWN WIFE.

13:29.476 --> 13:30.894
FATHER,
THIS IS SERIOUS.

13:30.978 --> 13:32.396
OF COURSE,
IT' S SERIOUS.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.773
I SHALL PROBABLY
CONCEDE THE GAME.

13:34.857 --> 13:35.983
IT'S A ROYAL PREROGATIVE
TO BE UNSPORTING.

13:36.066 --> 13:38.277
NEVER CONCEDE.

13:38.319 --> 13:40.070
I THROW.

13:49.079 --> 13:50.039
BLACK 5 !

13:55.794 --> 13:58.756
THE MATCH, FATHER, WAS OF
YOUR MAKING NOT OF MINE.

13:58.839 --> 14:00.299
EVEN So,
AS A DUTIFUL SON,

14:00.382 --> 14:01.926
I JOURNEYED FAR
BEYOND OUR BORDERS

14:01.967 --> 14:04.261
TO PAY MY RESPECTS
TO THE LADY AND...

14:04.303 --> 14:05.387
SEE FOR MYSELF.

14:05.471 --> 14:08.182
AND SHE WAS FAIR,
WAS SHE NOT?

14:08.223 --> 14:10.809
INDEED, SIR. PERHAPS
PALE RATHER THAN FAIR.

14:10.851 --> 14:13.270
A SICKLY LADY, SIR,
GIVEN TO MUCH SWOONING

14:13.312 --> 14:14.647
AND... AND VAPORS.

14:14.730 --> 14:16.190
ALL LADIES SWOON. THEY KNOW
IT'S EXPECTED OF THEM.

14:16.231 --> 14:17.524
SOME SWOON
MORE THAN OTHERS, SIR,

14:17.608 --> 14:21.028
AND SWOONING TO EXCESS IS NOT
A QUALITY I GREATLY ADMIRE.

14:21.070 --> 14:24.031
SHE REFUSED YOU? IS THAT
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

14:24.114 --> 14:26.283
No, FATHER,
SHE COULD NOT REFUSE ME

14:26.367 --> 14:28.243
BECAUSE I DID NOT OFFER.

14:28.285 --> 14:30.537
YOU PERHAPS PLACED
TOO MUCH TRUST

14:30.621 --> 14:33.290
IN THE PORTRAIT PAINTERS
OF CAROLSFELD.

14:33.332 --> 14:36.919
THE LIKENESS
WAS No LIKENESS.

14:37.002 --> 14:39.463
INDEED, SINCE YOU FORCE ME
TO THE DISCOURTESY,

14:39.505 --> 14:41.257
THE LADY WAS BALD, SIR.

14:41.298 --> 14:44.134
HER GOLDEN TRESSES FALSE!

14:44.218 --> 14:47.763
HER MOUTH CRABBED WITH AGE, SIR,
AND DEVOID OF TEETH!

14:47.805 --> 14:52.643
IN SHORT, SIR, SHE LEFT
MUCH TO BE DESIRED.

14:52.726 --> 14:55.062
EXTRAORDINARY '.

14:55.145 --> 14:57.648
FATHER,
IT'S A SMALL THING

14:57.731 --> 14:59.608
AND DOUBTLESS
VERY IRRITATING TO YOU

14:59.692 --> 15:02.319
BUT WHEN I MARRY,
AS NEEDS I MUST ONE DAY,

15:02.361 --> 15:04.154
IT WILL BE FOR THE
CONVENIENCE OF LOVE,

15:04.196 --> 15:07.449
RATHER THAN THE CONVENIENCE
OF... CONVENIENCE.

15:07.491 --> 15:08.951
LOVE?
DID HE SAY LOVE?

15:08.993 --> 15:11.245
HA HA!
HOW ABSURD.

15:11.287 --> 15:15.249
WHAT HAS LOVE GOT TO DO
WITH GETTING MARRIED?

15:15.332 --> 15:18.877
WHY SHOULD LOVE ENTER
INTO IT AT ALL?

15:18.919 --> 15:23.215
LOVE CAN MAKE YOU QUITE EMOTIONALLY
HARRIED WHEN YOU'RE MARRIED

15:23.299 --> 15:27.219
IT'S PEDANTIC
AND ROMANTIC FOLDEROL

15:27.261 --> 15:31.181
FIND A MATE, DEAR BOY,
FIND A MATE

15:31.265 --> 15:33.309
PRINCESS SUSAN
PRINCESS KAREN

15:33.350 --> 15:35.311
PRINCESS KATE

15:35.352 --> 15:39.565
FIND A MATE, DEAR BOY,
FIND A MATE

15:39.607 --> 15:43.110
LOVE WILL HAVE TO WAIT

15:51.410 --> 15:55.080
WHAT HAS LOVE GOT TO
DO WITH BEING MARRIED?

15:55.164 --> 15:59.084
BEING MARRIED IS
A PROBLEM ALL ITS OWN

15:59.126 --> 16:03.255
LOVE IS HIGHLY OVERRATED AND
MAKES MARRIAGE COMPLICATED

16:03.339 --> 16:06.467
WHEN THE BED IS
ELEVATED TO THE THRONE

16:06.550 --> 16:10.471

16:47.508 --> 16:51.220
WHAT HAS MARRIAGE GOT TO DO
WITH BEING HAPPY?

16:51.303 --> 16:55.349
BEING MARRIED CAN'T COMPARE
WITH BEING ROYAL

16:55.432 --> 16:59.228
BEING ROYAL YOU ENGENDER
EVERY LUXURY AND SPLENDOR

16:59.270 --> 17:03.232
WHILE A MARRIAGE
CAN GET OVERRIPE AND SPOIL

17:03.315 --> 17:07.069

A LITTLE FAUX PAS?

17:24.752 --> 17:26.130
I WAS ENJOYING MYSELF.

17:26.213 --> 17:29.675
THERE, YOU SEE, THAT'S THE PRICE
THAT WE SHALL HAVE TO PAY

17:29.717 --> 17:31.594

MY COLOR.

19:14.071 --> 19:15.823
Girl :
So UNBECOMING.

19:15.864 --> 19:19.827
ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE'S
So YOUNG AND PRETTY.

19:19.910 --> 19:22.955
AND WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU ARE GOING, CHILD?

19:22.997 --> 19:24.748
TO MY ROOM,
STEPMOTHER.

YOUR ROOM?

19:27.042 --> 19:28.544
Girls : HER ROOM!

19:28.586 --> 19:32.548
Stepmother: ALL THE ROOMS

FOR YOU.

19:53.569 --> 19:55.904

20:00.993 --> 20:04.079
PLACING YOU IN MY CARE

20:04.121 --> 20:05.539
MY FATHER
NEVER LOVED YOU.

20:05.623 --> 20:06.540
YOU TRICKED HIM.

20:06.624 --> 20:07.750
HOW DARE YOU, MADAM!

20:07.833 --> 20:09.251
YOU TRICKED HIM!

20:09.293 --> 20:10.794
WELL...

20:12.296 --> 20:15.007
WELL IF I DID,

20:15.090 --> 20:17.843

20:31.148 --> 20:34.485
NOW, LISTEN TO ME, GIRL,
AND HEAR ME WELL!

20:34.526 --> 20:36.904
BLOOD IS THICKER
THAN A WIDOWS TEARS,

20:36.987 --> 20:40.407
AND GOD KNOWS I HAVE SHED
ENOUGH OF THOSE.

20:40.491 --> 20:43.160
I HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS
OF MY OWN TO SUPPORT,

20:43.244 --> 20:44.954
WHICH SITUATION
HAS FORCED ME

20:45.037 --> 20:47.289
TO MAKE CERTAIN ECONOMIES
IN THE HOUSEHOLD.

20:47.331 --> 20:48.874
IS THAT NOT SO, GIRLS?

20:48.916 --> 20:51.043
YES, MAMA.

20:51.085 --> 20:53.504
CERTAIN DRASTIC
ECONOMIES, MAMA.

20:53.545 --> 20:55.464
EXACTLY.

20:55.547 --> 20:57.508
BUT BEING A WOMAN

ALLOWS AND THE LAW UPHOLDS.

So, TAKE YOUR PICK,

21:26.912 --> 21:28.122
EITHER ACCEPT
YOUR LOT

21:28.163 --> 21:29.081
OR Go TO
THE ORPHANAGE.

21:29.206 --> 21:31.000
Stepsister: THEY TELL ME,

COME ALONG, MY DOVES, WE

30:47.348 --> 30:48.557
I SAW NO ONE, SIR.

30:48.599 --> 30:50.768
I COULD HAVE SWORN.

30:50.851 --> 30:52.353
A SERVANT GIRL.

31:08.786 --> 31:12.581
SO, MADAM, YOU ARE
RETURNED AT LAST!

31:12.623 --> 31:15.084
YOU WICKED GIRL,
HOW DARE YOU DISOBEY ME.

31:15.125 --> 31:17.253

GRAVE, STEPMOTHER,

31:23.801 --> 31:26.220
HOW TOUCHING...

31:26.303 --> 31:28.055
WITH FLOWERS
FROM MY GARDEN,

31:28.138 --> 31:29.098
STOLEN FLOWERS !

31:29.139 --> 31:30.057

31:30.140 --> 31:31.600
I SAY YES !

31:31.642 --> 31:32.768
I SAY YOU STOLE THEM.

31:32.851 --> 31:35.437
YOU'RE NOT ONLY
A LIAR BUT A THIEF,

31:35.479 --> 31:37.773
AND THIEVES WE KNOW
MUST BE PUNISHED.

31:37.815 --> 31:39.149
COME !

31:40.150 --> 31:41.610
THIS IS YOUR PLACE,

31:41.652 --> 31:43.904
AND THERE
IS YOUR TASK.

31:43.988 --> 31:46.407
WE ARE EXPECTING GUESTS
FOR DINNER TONIGHT...

31:46.490 --> 31:48.075
IMPORTANT GUESTS.

31:48.158 --> 31:52.288
AND FOR REPAYING MY KINDNESS
WITH CUNNING AND DECEIT,

31:52.329 --> 31:54.790
HENCEFORTH, YOU WILL NOT DARE
TO VENTURE FROM THIS ROOM

31:54.832 --> 31:55.916
WITHOUT MY SAYING.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.293
IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?

31:57.334 --> 31:58.919
YES, STEPMOTHER.

31:59.003 --> 32:02.423
THEN MAKE A START
AND MAKE AMENDS.

32:15.311 --> 32:17.104
Prince: JOHN,
TELL ME SOMETHING.

32:17.146 --> 32:18.397
HAVE YOU EVER WISHED
YOU WERE IN LOVE?

32:18.480 --> 32:19.898
OH, YES.

32:19.982 --> 32:22.568
OFTEN? I MEAN,
AS OFTEN AS I WISH IT?

32:22.651 --> 32:24.445
WELL...

32:24.486 --> 32:25.905
WELL, I AM IN LOVE.

32:25.988 --> 32:28.407
YOU ARE? HOW AMAZING.

32:28.490 --> 32:29.408
WHO IS SHE?

32:29.491 --> 32:31.201
THE LADY CAROLINE,
SIR, SINCE YOU ASK.

32:31.285 --> 32:33.913
WHAT? THE LADY-IN-WAITING
TO MY GRANDMOTHER?

32:33.954 --> 32:34.914
THAT LADY CAROLINE?

32:34.997 --> 32:35.915
YES.

32:35.998 --> 32:37.124
HOW AMAZING!

32:37.166 --> 32:38.083
WM.

32:38.167 --> 32:39.460
WELL, IT' S EXTRAORDINARY.

32:39.501 --> 32:41.086
NOT EXTRAORDINARILY
EXTRAORDINARY, OF COURSE,

32:41.170 --> 32:43.088
BUT I NEVER GUESSED.

32:43.172 --> 32:44.256
HEH, HEH. I KNOW.

32:44.340 --> 32:45.591
WELL, I'M DELIGHTED.
YOU HAVE M'! BLESSING.

32:45.674 --> 32:47.051
I - I - I MUST
CONGRATULATE HER.

32:47.092 --> 32:49.595
No! No, PLEASE, SIR.
DON'T DO THAT.

32:49.678 --> 32:51.931
IT'S KIND OF YOU, BUT
IT WOULDN'T BE SEEMLY.

32:52.014 --> 32:53.891
HOW SO?

32:53.974 --> 32:55.434
ALAS, MY CAUSE
IS A LOST ONE.

32:55.559 --> 32:57.937
WELL, THE LADY DOES NOT
RETURN YOUR AFFECTIONS?

32:58.020 --> 33:02.232
OH, INDEED! BUT THE FACT
REMAINS THAT I AM WHAT I AM:

33:02.274 --> 33:03.859
A SERVANT!

33:03.901 --> 33:05.819
POSITIOH, SIR.
POSITION.

33:05.903 --> 33:09.031
JOHN, I'M TWICE AMAZED.

33:09.073 --> 33:11.200
I MUST BE VERY DENSE.
AM I?

33:11.242 --> 33:13.035
OF COURSE NOT. YOU
HAVE YOUR PROBLEMS;

33:13.118 --> 33:14.912
I HAVE MINE.

33:17.289 --> 33:20.209
King: WHERE ARE WE?

33:20.292 --> 33:21.794
THAT's US?

33:23.629 --> 33:25.422
YOU'RE SURE THIS MAP'S
BEEN DRAWN TO SCALE?

33:25.464 --> 33:26.590
I BELIEVE SO,
YOUR MAJESTY.

33:26.632 --> 33:28.050
THEN WHAT HAVE I BEEN
LOOKING AT ALL THESE YEARS?

33:28.133 --> 33:30.094
I THOUGHT THAT WAS US.

33:31.595 --> 33:35.891
I ALWAYS GO BY
THE BROWN PARTS FOR THE LAND

33:35.975 --> 33:38.269
AND THE BLUE PARTS
FOR THE SEA.

33:38.310 --> 33:39.228
WHO'S THAT?

33:39.270 --> 33:40.229
FIRST LORD OF
THE NAVY, SIRE.

33:40.312 --> 33:41.230
HAVE WE GOT A NAVY?

33:41.272 --> 33:42.356
THE ROYAL BARGE
ON THE LAKE?

33:42.439 --> 33:43.399
OH, YES, YES.

33:43.482 --> 33:44.900
WELL, REMIND ME NOT
TO TRAVEL IN IT AGAIN.

33:44.942 --> 33:48.237
King: SO, EVEN ALLOWING FOR
ERRORS IN THE CARTOGRAPHER'S ART,

33:48.279 --> 33:52.116
WE ARE SMALL IN COMPARISON
WITH OUR NEIGHBORS.

33:52.157 --> 33:54.410
THOUGH GREAT IN, AHH,
WHAT'S THE WORD?

33:54.451 --> 33:55.744
ER, TRADITION?

33:55.828 --> 33:58.372
TRADITIOH, YES. GREAT
IN TRADITION AND SPIRIT,

33:58.455 --> 34:01.208
IN FACT, WE ARE SMALL.

34:01.250 --> 34:02.876
HEAR, HEAR.

34:02.960 --> 34:04.044
SO WE HAVE TO HAVE A PLAN!

34:04.128 --> 34:06.338
NOW, YOU'RE ALL AWARE
OF THE PROBLEMS

34:06.422 --> 34:08.716
OF MY SON'S RELUCTANCE TO
HAVE A PERFECTLY GOOD WIFE

34:08.757 --> 34:10.175
CHOSEN FOR HIM.

34:10.301 --> 34:11.719
THIS GENERATION HAS
No RESPECT AT ALL.

34:11.760 --> 34:16.348
I MEAN, I WAS MARRIED OFF
BEFORE I WAS 14!

34:16.431 --> 34:19.018
CAROLSFELD - -WHERE'S THAT?

34:19.101 --> 34:23.397
AH, YOU SEE, THE SIZE OF IT,
SEE THE SIZE OF IT. PERFECT.

34:23.480 --> 34:25.065
NOW, WHAT'S THE SOLUTION?

34:25.149 --> 34:26.400
WITH RESPECT,
YOUR MAJESTY,

34:26.483 --> 34:29.570
I HAVE PREPARED
A SMALL PAPER.

34:29.652 --> 34:32.572
WHAT I AM SEEKING
IS A PROPER BALANCE,

34:32.656 --> 34:34.241
WEIGHING
WHAT WE SACK

34:34.283 --> 34:36.243
AGAINST WHAT
WE HAVE TO OFFER.

34:36.284 --> 34:39.914
OH, FOR GOODNESS SAKES, STOP TALKING
IN THOSE BORING, DIPLOMATIC RIDDLES.

34:39.996 --> 34:40.956
SPEAK THE KING'S
EUPHRANIAN, MAN!

34:41.040 --> 34:43.583
FORGIVE ME, YOUR MAJESTY.

34:43.667 --> 34:46.587
I HAD IN MIND A CELEBRATION.

34:46.629 --> 34:47.755
King: WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO CELEBRATE?

34:47.838 --> 34:48.922
A MARRIAGE, SIRE.

34:48.964 --> 34:50.090
GETTING MARRIED AGAIN?

34:50.174 --> 34:51.550
HMM. FINALLY
GOT RID OF HER, EH?

34:51.634 --> 34:53.260
WELL, NOT MY MARRIAGE, SIRE.

34:53.344 --> 34:55.429
HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS,
THE PRINCE EDWARD'S.

34:55.512 --> 34:56.429
WELL, WE'D ALL LIKE
TO CELEBRATE THAT.

34:56.472 --> 34:57.765
THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

34:57.848 --> 35:00.100
SOMETIMES I THINK I'M
SURROUNDED BY A LOT OF IDIOTS.

35:00.184 --> 35:02.227
HERE WE ARE, HEDGED
IN BY HOSTILE FORCES,

35:02.269 --> 35:05.564
AND ALL YOU CAN THINK OF IS
SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN THOUGHT OF.

35:05.648 --> 35:08.525
SIRE, THIS TIME,
I HAVE A NEW IDEA,

35:08.609 --> 35:11.528
AN IDEA THAT THE PRINCE HIMSELF
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RESIST!

35:11.570 --> 35:13.280
WELL, MAKE SURE
THAT SHE'S GOT TEETH.

35:13.364 --> 35:14.740
HE'S GOT AN OBSESSION
ABOUT THEM HAVING TEETH.

35:14.782 --> 35:16.825
I THOUGHT, A BALL!

35:16.867 --> 35:18.535
A BALL?

35:18.619 --> 35:20.746
A GREAT BALL !

35:20.788 --> 35:24.208
THE GREATEST BALL THAT
HAS EVER BEEN KNOWN, SIRE.

35:24.250 --> 35:27.836
AND TO IT, WE WILL INVITE EVERY
ELIGIBLE PRINCESS IN EUROPE,

35:27.920 --> 35:31.215
AND EVEN BEYOND,
YOUR MAJESTY.

35:31.298 --> 35:32.591
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THAT IDEA?

35:32.633 --> 35:35.052
I REMEMBER MY FIRST BALL.

35:35.094 --> 35:37.137
YES, WELL, WE DON'T WANT TO Go
INTO THE REALMS OE FANTASY.

35:37.179 --> 35:38.097
WHAT ELSE?

35:38.180 --> 35:41.350
I HAVE PREPARED A LIST,
your: MAJESTY,

35:41.392 --> 35:43.727
AND I THOUGHT WE COULD
MAKE SUCH PREPARATIONS

35:43.811 --> 35:46.730
AS WOULD DAZZLE
OUR ENEMIES AND DMDE THEM,

35:46.772 --> 35:49.942
FOR PROTOCOL WOULD NOT
ALLOW THEM TO MAKE WAR

35:49.984 --> 35:51.402
WHILE THEY ARE GUESTS
IN OUR MIDST.

35:51.485 --> 35:53.821
AND I REMAIN CONVINCED
THAT THE PRINCE, YOUR SON,

35:53.862 --> 35:55.114
WILL DO HIS DUTY.

35:55.197 --> 35:58.576
INDEED, FACE TO FACE IN THE
PRESENCE OF THE ENTIRE COURT

35:58.659 --> 36:00.786
HE COULD HARDLY FAIL
TO DO ANYTHING ELSE.

36:00.828 --> 36:03.205
General: THE OCCASION,
THE MUSIC, THE CANDLELIGHT,

36:03.247 --> 36:05.124
THE SWIRLING DRESSES,
THE PERFUME,

36:05.207 --> 36:07.710
THE VERY ATMOSPHERE OF LOVE!

36:07.751 --> 36:09.878
PUT HIM ON
THE RETIREMENT LIST.

36:09.920 --> 36:11.672
I SHALL MAKE
A ROYAL DECISION!

36:11.755 --> 36:14.008
TAKING THIS IDEA
AND IMPROVING ON IT,

36:14.091 --> 36:16.468
WE MUST PLAN EVERY DETAIL.

36:16.552 --> 36:17.595
NOBLESSE OBLIGE!

36:17.595 --> 36:18.887
Chamberlain:
QUITE SO, YOUR MAJESTY.

36:18.929 --> 36:21.390
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT DIPLOMACY.

36:21.432 --> 36:22.933
PROTOCOL!

36:25.102 --> 36:31.233
YES, WE MUST BE
PROTOCOLIGORICALLY CORRECT

36:31.275 --> 36:35.696
GOOD FORM MUST NEVER SUFFER
FROM NEGLECT

36:35.779 --> 36:39.199
THE RULES AND
REGULATIONS WE RESPECT

36:39.283 --> 36:41.911
MUST BE TREATED CIRCUMSPECT

36:41.952 --> 36:44.079
ELSE THE KINGDOM
WILL BE WRECKED

36:44.121 --> 36:46.040
WE'VE A SYSTEM TO PROTECT

36:46.123 --> 36:47.708
CHECKED AND DOUBLE-CHECKED

36:47.791 --> 36:50.753
AND PROTOCOLIGORICALLY
CORRECT

36:50.794 --> 36:53.213
SIRE! PLEASE, SIRE.

36:53.297 --> 36:56.759
WHEN ITS ARMY IS
BATTERED AND BROKEN

36:56.800 --> 37:00.054
AND BACK TO ITS
BORDERS IT CRAWLS

37:00.137 --> 37:03.682
TO WHAT CLINGS
A TOTTERING KINGDOM

37:03.724 --> 37:06.852
IF NOT TO ITS PROTOCOLS?

37:06.936 --> 37:10.356
AND WHEN THE TREASURY'S
TAPPED OF ITS TREASURES

37:10.439 --> 37:13.525
ARE THE TAPESTRIES
STRIPPED FROM THE WALLS?

37:13.567 --> 37:17.363
No, THE COURT CARRIES ON
WITH ITS PLEASURES

37:17.446 --> 37:19.990
INQUISITIONS
AND BANQUETS AND BALLS

37:20.032 --> 37:25.537
All: BUT THEY MUST BE
PROTOCOLIGORICALLY CORRECT

37:25.621 --> 37:29.083
GOOD FORM MUST NEVER SUFFER
FROM NEGLECT

37:29.124 --> 37:32.378
THE RULES AND REGULATIONS
WE RESPECT

37:32.461 --> 37:34.338
T MUST BE TREATED CIRCUMSPECT

37:34.380 --> 37:36.298

CHECKED AND DOUBLE-CHECKED

37:39.468 --> 37:42.596

CORRECT

37:42.638 --> 37:43.847
HO, HO,
WELL-DONE, SIRE.

37:43.931 --> 37:45.099
PRECEDENT!

37:45.140 --> 37:47.393
WE NEED A BOOK THAT WILL
GIVE US CHAPTER AND VERSE.

37:47.476 --> 37:49.228
IN THE LIBRARY--
IT'LL BE IN THE LIBRARY.

37:49.311 --> 37:53.899
I BELIEVE WE ARE ALREADY WITHIN
THE LIBRARY, YOUR MAJESTY.

37:53.983 --> 37:55.943
WELL, OF COURSE,
OF COURSE.

37:55.985 --> 37:57.236
I KNEW THAT !

37:57.319 --> 37:58.904
WHAT VOLUME
DO YOU SUGGEST?

37:58.988 --> 38:01.282
THERE IS ONLY ONE,
YOUR MAJESTY, THE BIBLE.

38:01.323 --> 38:02.825
BIBLE?! WELL, LET'S KEEP
RELIGION OUT OF IT.

38:02.866 --> 38:05.327
NO, SIRE. I SHOULD
SAY IN THIS CASE,

38:05.369 --> 38:07.663
THE BIBLE IS FORMS
AND ADDRESSES

38:07.705 --> 38:09.665
FOR ROYAL OCCASIONS
B'! DE LYON.

38:09.748 --> 38:10.874
AH.

38:10.916 --> 38:12.501
NOW THEN,
LET ME SEE, SIRE...

38:12.585 --> 38:14.211
ABDICATIONS,
DISMISSAL OF MINISTERS,

38:14.253 --> 38:15.504
GARDEN PARTIES,
INVESTITURES...

38:15.546 --> 38:16.672
JUDICIAL BEHEADINGS"

38:16.755 --> 38:17.840
YES, SKIP ALL THAT.

38:17.881 --> 38:20.175
YOUR MAJESTY, QUESTIONS
OF PRECEDENT PERTAINING

38:20.217 --> 38:22.344
TO THE SEATING
OF CROWNED HEADS

38:22.428 --> 38:23.887
IN DIFFICULT SITUATIONS.

38:23.929 --> 38:26.056
AHH! WE SHOULD REHEARSE IT!

38:26.098 --> 38:28.392
UH, YOU CAN BE
THE PRINCESS ESMERELDA,

38:28.434 --> 38:30.436

THE EMPEROR OF BRATISLAVA,

38:37.610 --> 38:39.737
AND, UH... OH, THE REST OF YOU CAN
SORT IT OUT AMONGST YOURSELVES.

38:39.778 --> 38:43.198
WHAT AN INSPIRED IDEA,
YOUR MAJESTY.

38:43.240 --> 38:46.702
IF THE DAUGHTER OF
THE DUCHESS OF SNARDEN

38:46.785 --> 38:50.915
WERE TO BE SEATED BY
THE COUNTESS OF SNEAD

38:50.956 --> 38:54.877
FOR THIS BREACH
OF DECORUM TO SNARDEN

38:54.960 --> 38:58.422
THE INVASION
OF SNEAD WOULD PROCEED QI

38:58.464 --> 39:02.343
AND SEAT THE HEIRESS
TO THE BARONY OF NEUBURG

39:02.384 --> 39:05.179
BY THE SIDE OF HER
HATED COUSIN GWENN

39:05.262 --> 39:09.808
OH, HOW QUICKLY
THE ARMIES OF NEUBURG

39:09.892 --> 39:13.354
WOULD DEPLOY
TO DESTROY US AGAIN

39:13.437 --> 39:18.859
All: SO WE MUST BE
PROTOCOLIGORICALLY CORRECT

39:18.943 --> 39:22.738

40:32.683 --> 40:37.271
THE RULES AND REGULATIONS
WE RESPECT

40:37.354 --> 40:40.149
T MUST BE TREATED CIRCUMSPECT

40:40.190 --> 40:42.776
ELSE THE KINGDOM
WILL BE WRECKED

40:42.860 --> 40:45.613
WE'VE A SYSTEM TO PROTECT

40:45.696 --> 40:47.448
CHECKED AND DOUBLE-CHECKED

40:47.531 --> 40:52.536
AND PROTOCOLIGORICALLY
CORRECT

40:58.208 --> 41:00.544
PROTOCOLIGORICALLY CORRECT

41:28.155 --> 41:29.573
WELL, NOW!

41:29.615 --> 41:31.909
WERE YOU EXPECTING ME?

41:31.992 --> 41:35.621
NO. I WASN'T
EXPECTING ANYBODY.

41:35.663 --> 41:39.416
FUNNY. YOU SHOULD
HAVE FELT SOMETHING.

41:39.541 --> 41:41.418
I'M LOSING MY TOUCH.

41:41.502 --> 41:43.754
COULD I COME IN AND REST
BY YOUR FIRE, PLEASE?

41:43.837 --> 41:46.090
I'VE BEEN TRAVELING
A LONG WAY.

41:46.131 --> 41:50.928
WELL... I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO
TALK TO ANYBODY OR SEE ANYBODY,

41:50.970 --> 41:53.013
BUT...

41:53.097 --> 41:55.766
YES, OF COURSE.

41:55.808 --> 41:58.435
YOU'RE WELCOME
TO SHARE MY FIRE...

41:58.477 --> 42:00.437
SUCH AS IT IS,

42:00.521 --> 42:02.940
BUT I'D BE OBLIGED
IF YOU DIDN'T STAY TOO LONG.

42:05.776 --> 42:08.028
PLEASE EXCUSE ME
IF I CARRY ON WORKING,

42:08.112 --> 42:10.447
BUT I HAVE TO FINISH
THESE, AND I'M VERY SLOW.

42:10.489 --> 42:15.160
YES! WELL, THERE ARE MORE WAYS
THAN ONE OF PEELING POTATOES.

42:19.290 --> 42:21.041
THE FIRE SEEMS
TO HAVE CHEERED UP.

42:21.125 --> 42:23.043
I COULD WARM YOU A LITTLE
BROTH IF YOU LIKE.

42:23.127 --> 42:26.213
No, THANK YOU.
BUT THANK YOU FOR THE THOUGHT.

42:28.632 --> 42:30.718
LIVE DOWN HERE
on YOUR own, no YOU?

42:30.801 --> 42:33.095
I DO NOW.
YES.

42:33.137 --> 42:34.930
THINGS HAVE CHANGED.

42:34.972 --> 42:37.099
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN TO SAY
THEY WON'T CHANGE AGAIN.

42:37.141 --> 42:39.935
I GET AROUND QUITE A BIT,
YOU KNOW.

42:39.977 --> 42:41.228
MUST BE NICE TO TRAVEL.

42:41.270 --> 42:43.230
YES AND No.

42:43.314 --> 42:46.942
I SOMETIMES WISH
I COULD SETTLE IN ONE PLACE,

42:46.984 --> 42:49.445
BUT THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH TIME.

42:49.486 --> 42:54.909
I'D LIKE SOMEWHERE COZY,
WITH A DOG TO KEEP ME COMPANY.

42:54.992 --> 42:57.202
I EXPECT YOUR DOG IS
A GREAT COMFORT TO YOU.

42:57.286 --> 43:00.372
MY DOG?
I HAVEN'T GOT A DOG.

43:00.414 --> 43:03.417
ISN'T HE YOURS?

43:04.460 --> 43:05.878
WHERE DID HE COME FROM?

43:05.961 --> 43:07.671
HE CAME IN WHEN I CAME IN.

43:10.799 --> 43:15.179
OH! OH, WHAT AM I GOING
TO DO WITH HIM?

43:15.262 --> 43:16.889
WELL, WHY DON'T
YOU KEEP HIM?

43:16.972 --> 43:19.224
HE'LL TAKE CARE
OF HIMSELF.

43:19.308 --> 43:21.727
HE'S AN OLD HAND AT THAT.

43:21.810 --> 43:23.228
OHH!

43:23.312 --> 43:25.064
HE SEEMS TO LIKE YOU.

43:25.147 --> 43:27.107
OH, I LOVE HIM!

43:27.149 --> 43:30.027
I'M JUST SO AFRAID OF WHAT
MY STEPMOTHER WILL SAY.

43:30.152 --> 43:31.737
Stepmother: CINDERELLA!

43:31.820 --> 43:34.907
THERE SHE IS,
AND I HAVEN'T FINISHED!

43:34.949 --> 43:36.075
I'VE GOT TO HIDE YOU.

43:36.158 --> 43:39.245
WELL, I'LL BE OFF.
I'VE SEEN WHAT I WANT TO SEE.

43:39.286 --> 43:41.247
YOU JUST TAKE CARE OF HIM.

43:41.330 --> 43:44.416
Stepmother: CINDERELLA!

43:44.500 --> 43:47.920
I KNOW! I'LL HIDE
YOU UNDER HERE.

43:48.003 --> 43:51.215
PROMISE NOT
TO MAKE A SOUND.

43:51.257 --> 43:53.259
HAVE YOU BEEN
STRUCK DUMB, GIRL?

43:53.342 --> 43:56.095
OH!
OH!

43:56.178 --> 43:58.097
ANSWER ME WHEN I CALL.

43:58.180 --> 44:01.684
YOU KNOW I HATE HAVING
TO RAISE M'! VOICE.

44:01.725 --> 44:06.689
NOW, I HOPE YOU HAVE
BEEN HARD AT WORK. I...

44:13.779 --> 44:15.447
I SEE.

44:20.286 --> 44:21.787
WELL, UH...

44:23.914 --> 44:25.457
UH, I SEE.

44:28.794 --> 44:32.965
I SEE I SHALL HAVE TO GIVE
YOU MORE TO DO NEXT TIME.

44:45.644 --> 44:47.813
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF ALL THAT?

44:52.735 --> 44:54.069
King: I WILL NOT HAVE
MY AUTHORITY FLOUTED

44:54.153 --> 44:55.112
IN THIS FASHION.

44:55.154 --> 44:56.405
IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE CUSTOM

44:56.488 --> 44:59.116
FOR THE HEIR TO THE THRONE
TO TAKE A WIFE IN GOOD TIME.

44:59.158 --> 45:01.410
AND YOU SHOW A STRANGE RELUCTANCE
TO COMPLY WITH TRADITION.

45:01.452 --> 45:04.038
FATHER,
I EMPHATICALLY DISAGREE.

45:04.121 --> 45:07.541
AND I TOTALLY REFUSE TO TAKE PART
IN SUCH AN EMBARRASSING CHARADE.

45:07.625 --> 45:08.542
BUT I'VE DECREED IT!

45:08.626 --> 45:09.877
THEN YOU MUST
UNDECREE IT.

45:09.960 --> 45:11.045
IMPOSSIBLE !

45:11.128 --> 45:12.254
YOU TALK TO HIM.

45:12.296 --> 45:13.255
DEAREST BOY--

45:13.339 --> 45:14.548
OH, MOTHER,
IT'S NO USE TRYING

45:14.590 --> 45:16.008
TO GET ROUND ME
THAT WAY.

45:16.133 --> 45:17.384
THE VERY IDEA
OF GIVING A BALL

45:17.468 --> 45:19.511
AND INVITING A SELECTION
OF TITLED WALLFLOWERS

45:19.595 --> 45:21.847
TO VIE FOR MY HAND
IS UTTERLY REPULSIVE!

45:21.931 --> 45:24.224
DEGRADING
TO ALL CONCERNED.

45:24.266 --> 45:26.226
IN MY DAY,
I NEVER HAD THE CHOICE!

45:26.310 --> 45:28.062
NOT THAT I WOULD HAVE CHOSEN
ANY DIFFERENTLY, OF COURSE.

45:28.145 --> 45:30.397
YOU TAKE A DECISION
WITHOUT CONSULTING ME.

45:30.481 --> 45:32.566
WELL I AM YOUR FATHER,
AND I AM THE KING!

45:32.650 --> 45:34.526
IT'S LIKE SOME
SORDID BEAUTY CONTEST

45:34.610 --> 45:36.612
WITH ME
AS THE GRAND PRIZE.

45:36.695 --> 45:38.989
SINCE YOU WON'T GO TO MECCA,
MECCA MUST COME TO YOU!

45:39.073 --> 45:41.742
Queen: YOU HAVE TO GET
MARRIED SOMEDAY, DEAR.

45:41.825 --> 45:43.410
BUT NOT IN THIS WAY.

45:43.494 --> 45:47.289
WELL, IT SEEMS PERFECTLY
REASONABLE TO ME.

45:47.331 --> 45:50.751
WE'VE INVITED EVERY ELIGIBLE
PRINCESS IN THE ALMANAC.

45:50.834 --> 45:52.503
AND IT'S A QUESTION OF DUTY!

45:52.544 --> 45:56.590
FATHER, I HAVE NEVER QUESTIONED
THAT IT IS MY BOUNDEN DUTY

45:56.632 --> 45:59.760
TO TAKE A WIFE AND ENSURE
THE ROYAL SUCCESSION.

45:59.843 --> 46:03.514
BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN I HAVE TO BE
PARTY TO AND JUDGE A CATTLE SHOW!

46:03.597 --> 46:04.848
WHOEVER HEARD
OF SUCH A THING?

46:04.890 --> 46:07.017
CAP-CATTLE SHOW!

46:07.059 --> 46:09.853
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI

46:09.937 --> 46:11.897
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI

46:11.939 --> 46:14.567
WHERE EVERY MAIDEN'S
BOUND TO LAUGH AT ME

46:14.608 --> 46:16.694
THE ROYAL
FATTED CALF

46:16.777 --> 46:19.029
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI

46:19.071 --> 46:20.990
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI

46:21.031 --> 46:22.866
THOUGH I'M THE ONE
WHO DOES THE CHOOSING

46:22.950 --> 46:26.704
I'M THE ONE
WHO DOES THE LOSING

46:26.787 --> 46:29.206
IT'S NAUSEATING,
NAUSEATING!

46:29.290 --> 46:31.375
CAN'T YOU
JUST IMAGINE IT?

46:31.417 --> 46:33.210
HOPE SPRINGS IN ALL

46:33.252 --> 46:35.212
SHORT, FAT, OR TALL

46:35.296 --> 46:37.756
AS THEY PRIMP
AND PREEN AND PRAY

46:37.840 --> 46:40.050
THAT THIS WILL BE
THEIR LUCKY DAY

46:40.092 --> 46:42.261
THERE IS NO AFFAIR

46:42.303 --> 46:44.096
OF WHICH I'M AWARE

46:44.138 --> 46:47.891
MORE GALLING TO BEAR
THAN A BRIDE-FINDING BALL

46:47.975 --> 46:49.393
Montague:
I JUST HEARD THE NEWS!

46:49.476 --> 46:50.728
King: OH,
WHO LET HIM IN?

46:50.769 --> 46:54.189
IS IT TRUE, DEAR UNCLE?

46:54.231 --> 46:57.234
THE TATTLE IS THAT YOU'RE GOING
TO INVITE A WHOLE NURSERY

46:57.318 --> 46:58.986
OF NUBILE DELICACIES
TO A BALL.

46:59.069 --> 47:01.280
SOME OTHER TIME, NEPHEW.
WE'RE BUSY NOW.

47:01.322 --> 47:02.615
OH, BUT YOU CAN'T
KEEP ME IN SUSPENSE.

47:02.698 --> 47:04.033
YOU JUST CAN'T, UNCLE.

47:04.074 --> 47:06.368
I MEAN, I REALIZE THAT
I WON'T HAVE FIRST PICK,

47:06.410 --> 47:08.829
BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME
BECAUSE I'M NOT PROUD.

47:08.913 --> 47:09.830
I'M JUST DESPERATE.

47:09.914 --> 47:11.707
WE'RE ALL DESPERATE!

47:11.749 --> 47:15.336
SO IT'S TRUE, THEN!
OH, HOW EXCITING!

47:15.419 --> 47:19.715
NOW, I MUST DECIDE
WHAT TO WEAR.

47:19.757 --> 47:22.718
HIGH HEELS, I THINK, TO
GIVE ME ADDED STATURE.

47:22.760 --> 47:24.887
THE MOMENT YOU'VE
MADE YOUR CHOICE,

47:24.929 --> 47:26.680
I SHALL UNLEASH MYSELF.

47:26.764 --> 47:28.724
I'VE ALREADY MADE
MY CHOICE, COUSIN.

47:28.766 --> 47:29.975
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

47:30.059 --> 47:31.101
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR
PICK OF THE LOT.

47:31.143 --> 47:32.353
OH, BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

47:32.394 --> 47:35.064
YOU CAN'T BE SUCH
A SPOILSPORT! I MEAN...

47:35.105 --> 47:38.067
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI

47:38.108 --> 47:40.736
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI

47:40.778 --> 47:44.073
WHERE LUSCIOUS LOVELIES
FROM EACH LAND

47:44.114 --> 47:47.701
WILL VIE TO WIN
THE ROYAL HAND

47:47.743 --> 47:50.579
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI

47:50.621 --> 47:53.249
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI

47:53.290 --> 47:56.377
WITH FRILLS ON TRESSES,
PARTY DRESSES

47:56.460 --> 48:00.923
EVERY MAIDEN EFFERVESCES

48:00.965 --> 48:02.967
GIVING HER BEST

48:03.092 --> 48:05.678
GVING HER ALL

48:05.761 --> 48:08.514
DANCING, GLANCING,
LAUGHING, TEASING

48:08.597 --> 48:10.683
WHIRLING, SWIRLING

48:10.766 --> 48:14.728
TOUCHING, SQUEEZING

48:14.812 --> 48:17.189
THERE'S NO AFFAIR

48:17.273 --> 48:19.858
TO EVER COMPARE

48:19.942 --> 48:21.360
OR THRILL OR ENTHRALL

48:21.443 --> 48:24.613
LIKE A BRIDE-FINDING BALL

48:28.993 --> 48:31.203
Chamberlain: YOUR MAJESTY.

48:31.287 --> 48:32.705
King: WELL, WHAT IS IT?

48:32.746 --> 48:35.874
I BRING GRAVE TIDINGS.

48:35.958 --> 48:38.919
CAROLSFELD HAS MOBILIZED.

48:39.003 --> 48:40.212
THERE IS TALK OF WAR.

48:40.254 --> 48:41.213
WAR?!
WAR?!

48:41.297 --> 48:42.381
WAR.
WAR.

48:42.464 --> 48:44.883
AS YOUR MAJESTY'S
SENIOR MINISTER OF STATE,

48:44.967 --> 48:49.722
IT IS MY SOLEMN DUTY TO ADVISE YOU
THAT THE SITUATION IS CRITICAL.

48:49.805 --> 48:52.725
THE NEWS THAT HIS ROYAL
HIGHNESS SAW FIT TO DECLINE

48:52.766 --> 48:54.560
THE HAND OF THE
PRINCESS SELINA IN MARRIAGE,

48:54.643 --> 48:55.644
WAS ILL-RECEIVED.

48:55.686 --> 48:56.645
TRUE.
TRUE.

48:56.687 --> 48:59.732
EDWARD, M'! sou...

48:59.815 --> 49:03.694
I BESEECH YOU NOT AS A
FATHER BUT AS YOUR MONARCH.

49:03.736 --> 49:06.030
RECONSIDER BEFORE
IT'S TOO LATE.

49:06.071 --> 49:08.824
PUT ASIDE YOUR
PERSONAL FEELINGS.

49:08.908 --> 49:11.201
THE WHOLE COUNTRY LOOKS TO
YOU TO FORM AN ALLIANCE

49:11.243 --> 49:13.370
THROUGH
THE MARRIAGE BED.

49:13.412 --> 49:16.040
AND DO AS I DID WHEN
I TOOK YOUR MOTHER.

49:16.081 --> 49:19.084
I CLOSED MY EYES AND
THOUGHT OF EUPHRANIA.

49:42.733 --> 49:44.818
Chamberlain: BRATISLAVA!

49:49.448 --> 49:52.409
WILDENSTEIN!

49:52.451 --> 49:53.953
NEUBURG !

50:19.812 --> 50:21.814
OH!
OH!

50:47.339 --> 50:48.591
AAH!

51:02.146 --> 51:03.647
UHH!

51:05.316 --> 51:07.234
King: HOW MANY
DOES THAT MAKE?

51:07.318 --> 51:09.278
WELL, YOUR MAJESTY, OF THE
COURIERS WHO RETURNED,

51:09.320 --> 51:13.157
6 HAVE REPORTED
ACCEPTANCES.

51:13.198 --> 51:15.242
IN ADDITIOH, THERE
WERE 5 REFUSALS.

51:15.326 --> 51:18.245
ONE OF THEM COUCHED IN
THE MOST OBSCENE TERMS.

51:18.287 --> 51:20.247
TWO OF THOSE
INVITED WERE DEAD,

51:20.331 --> 51:23.250
AND THE REMAINING 3
COULD NOT BE TRACED.

51:23.292 --> 51:25.711
THAT MAKES 6 OUT OF 16.

51:25.794 --> 51:28.047
WELL, I THINK THAT'S
A FAIR AVERAGE, DON'T YOU?

51:28.130 --> 51:29.256
YES, INDEED, SIRE.

51:29.340 --> 51:31.258
PERHAPS NOT QUITE
THE BREADTH OF CHOICE

51:31.342 --> 51:33.928
WE AT FIRST ENVISAGED.

51:34.011 --> 51:36.430
WELL, INVITE ALL LOCAL
NOBILITY AS WELL.

51:36.513 --> 51:38.057
WE DON'T WANT
THE PLACE HALF EMPTY.

51:38.140 --> 51:39.975
WE CAN ALWAYS RAISE
THE TAXES TO PAY FOR IT.

51:40.059 --> 51:43.604
IN FACT, I'LL INVENT A NEW TAX,
A TAX ON SNOBBERY.

51:43.687 --> 51:44.605
THEY'LL ALL PAY THAT.

51:44.688 --> 51:46.607
BRILLIANT, YOUR MAJESTY!
BRILLIANT!

51:46.690 --> 51:47.608
DON'T OVER DO IT.
DON'T OVER DO IT.

51:47.691 --> 51:49.610
YOU'LL BE PAYING IT, TOO.

51:49.693 --> 51:52.613
Stepmother: GIRLS! GIRLS!

51:52.696 --> 51:54.281
ISOBELLA! PALATINE!

51:54.365 --> 51:55.282
Isobella and Palatine:
RIGHT HERE, MAMA!

51:55.366 --> 51:57.117
COME QUICKLY!

51:57.201 --> 51:58.786
WHAT IS IT, MAMA?

51:58.869 --> 52:00.913
WONDERFUL NEWS.

52:00.996 --> 52:04.208
WE HAVE RECEIVED A ROYAL
INVITATION TO A BALL

52:04.291 --> 52:07.044
IN HONOR OF HIS ROYAL
HIGHNESS, THE PRINCE!

52:07.127 --> 52:08.212
OH, MAMA, BUT--

52:08.254 --> 52:09.713
NOW, NOW, NOW,
CAREFUL, CAREFUL.

52:09.797 --> 52:10.714
YOU MIGHT TEAR IT,

52:10.756 --> 52:12.883
AND I WANT
TO HAVE IT FRAMED.

52:12.967 --> 52:14.385
OH, I THINK
IT'S SO EXCITING,

52:14.468 --> 52:15.719
I SHALL HAVE THE VAPORS!

52:15.761 --> 52:17.263
HOW SHALL I HAVE
MY HAIR?

52:17.346 --> 52:18.264
OH, WHAT SHALL I WEAR?

52:18.347 --> 52:19.556
THERE IS WORK
TO BE DONE.

52:19.640 --> 52:21.767
WE HAVE NOT
A MOMENT TO LOSE.

52:21.809 --> 52:23.435
WHAT CAN WE WEAR?!

52:23.477 --> 52:25.062
WE'LL HAVE TO HAVE
SOMETHING NEW.

52:25.104 --> 52:27.398
YES. I MEAN, NONE OF MY
THINGS ARE POSSIBLE.

52:27.439 --> 52:29.984
LET US GO AND SEE.

52:30.067 --> 52:32.403
OH! CAN YOU NEVER DO
A JOB PROPERLY, GIRL?

52:32.444 --> 52:33.904
LOOK AT ALL THAT DIRTY WATER.

52:33.988 --> 52:36.865
YOU HAD BETTER DO
THE WHOLE STAIRCASE AGAIN!

52:36.907 --> 52:38.158
COME, GIRLS!

52:38.242 --> 52:40.911
MAMA I THINK PALATINE
SHOULD WEAR A BROWN DRESS.

52:40.995 --> 52:42.246
Palatine:
YOU SPITEFUL CREATURE!

52:42.329 --> 52:44.415
YOU SHOULD WEAR GREEN
TO MATCH YOUR COMPLEXION.

52:44.456 --> 52:45.666
Isobella: OH, MAMA!

52:45.749 --> 52:47.960
BUT THE PRESTIGE, YOUR ROYAL
HIGHNESS, THE PRESTIGE!

52:48.002 --> 52:49.503
IT WILL PUT
EUPHRANIA ON THE MAP.

52:49.545 --> 52:51.255
UH, PIN THERE, IDIOT.

52:51.297 --> 52:54.091
NOT THERE, THERE.

52:54.174 --> 52:55.926
EXCUSE ME,
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.

52:56.010 --> 52:58.596
FINE, FINE, FINE.
ENOUGH'S ENOUGH.

52:58.637 --> 53:01.432
I'M DELIGHTED.
YOU'VE DONE VERY WELL.

53:01.473 --> 53:03.267
NOW LEAVE US, PLEASE.

53:10.274 --> 53:11.901
OH, JOHN!

53:13.569 --> 53:15.696
WHAT HAVE
I LET MYSELF IN FOR?

53:15.779 --> 53:18.574
A LITTLE MORE
POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE.

53:18.616 --> 53:20.200
AND WHO KNOWS?

53:20.284 --> 53:21.945
PERHAPS THERE WILL BE ONE TO
WHOM YOU CAN GIVE YOUR HEART.

53:22.036 --> 53:24.496
WILL YOU DANCE
WITH YOUR LADY CAROLINE?

53:24.538 --> 53:25.789
ALAS, NOT DONE, SIR.

53:25.873 --> 53:28.500
OH, YES, HOW STUPID OF ME.
I WAS FORGETTING.

53:28.542 --> 53:30.669
NOT IN 20 YEARS!

53:30.711 --> 53:31.795
WE'RE SOLD OUT!

53:31.879 --> 53:33.172
MY CHOICEST BROCADES!

53:33.213 --> 53:34.298
Stepmother: SOLD OUT?

53:34.381 --> 53:36.842
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU RIDICULOUS MAN?

53:36.884 --> 53:38.177
HOW CAN YOU BE SOLD OUT

53:38.218 --> 53:39.595
WHEN WE HAVE NOT
PURCHASED ANYTHING?

53:39.678 --> 53:41.555
THE BALL, GRACIOUS LADY.

53:41.639 --> 53:43.974
I'D SCARCELY OPENED ME DOORS THIS
MORNING WHEN THEY DESCENDED!

53:44.058 --> 53:45.809
WHO? WHO DESCENDED?

53:45.851 --> 53:47.811
EVERYBODY, MI LADY !

53:47.895 --> 53:50.147
THEY CAME LIKE
THE HERON TO THE POOL,

53:50.231 --> 53:51.315
TAKING EVERYTHING I HAD.

53:51.398 --> 53:53.859
I HAVE NEVER HEARD
OF SUCH A THING.

53:53.901 --> 53:56.528
YOU, MY GOOD MAN, SHOULD
LEARN TO DISTINGUISH

53:56.570 --> 53:59.406
BETWEEN RIFFRAFF AND PEOPLE
OF CONSEQUENCE, LIKE US.

53:59.448 --> 54:01.450
WHAT SHALL WE DO?

54:01.533 --> 54:02.826
Stepmother:
COACHMAN, DRIVE US HOME.

54:02.910 --> 54:05.246
GIRLS, DO STOP PULLING
THOSE DREADFUL FACES.

54:05.329 --> 54:07.748
I'M IN A BAD ENOUGH
MOOD AS IT IS.

54:07.790 --> 54:08.832
IDIOT!

54:11.043 --> 54:13.963
Palatine: OH, MAMA,
SHE'S SO BEASTLY TO ME!

54:14.046 --> 54:16.131
CINDERELLA!

54:16.173 --> 54:20.678
CINDERELLA! WHERE IS
THAT WRETCHED GIRL?

54:20.719 --> 54:23.305
WHY DO YOU NOT COME
WHEN I CALL YOU?

54:23.389 --> 54:25.808
COME OVER HERE. I HAVE
A JOB FOR YOU TO DO.

54:25.891 --> 54:30.854
TAKE THESE, UNPICK THEM, AND MAKE 3
SPLENDID NEW DRESSES OUT OF THEM.

54:30.938 --> 54:33.524
OH, MAMA, YOU'RE SO CLEVER.

54:33.566 --> 54:36.819
MAKE SURE THEY FIT
TO PERFECTION.

54:36.902 --> 54:37.820
NOW START IMMEDIATELY.

54:37.903 --> 54:40.155
THERE'S NOT A MOMENT
TO LOSE.

54:40.239 --> 54:42.783
BE SURE YOUR HANDS ARE CLEAN
BEFORE YOU START SEWING.

54:42.825 --> 54:45.327
AND WE'RE TO LOOK
AS PRETTY AS POSSIBLE.

54:45.411 --> 54:47.580
AH, WELL, AS PRETTY
AS WE ARE!

54:47.621 --> 54:53.002
WE MUST ALL BE
UTTERLY SPLENDID.

54:53.085 --> 54:55.504
SO RUN ALONG, CHILD.
START AT ONCE!

54:56.755 --> 54:59.049
YES...

55:01.010 --> 55:05.598
UTTERLY... SPLENDID!

55:24.825 --> 55:29.038
BUT ALREADY,
HIS HEART WAS--

55:29.121 --> 55:32.291
OH, HENRIETTA,
no STOP GRUMBLING.

55:32.333 --> 55:38.130
HIS HEART WAS
BURNING WITH... LOVE

55:38.172 --> 55:43.969
AS IF IT HAD BEEN LAID
ON RED HOT GOALS!

55:44.053 --> 55:47.806
YOU LIKE THAT?
So DO I.

55:47.848 --> 55:50.309
SIT DOWN, DEAR.
DON'T DO THAT.

55:50.351 --> 55:55.147
AT THIS POINT, SCHEHERAZADE
SAW THE APPROACH OF MORNING

55:55.189 --> 55:58.984
AND FELL SILENT.

55:59.068 --> 56:00.945
AS WELL SHE MIGHT.

56:02.488 --> 56:05.199
NOW LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE,
SET YOUR FRIENDS OFF.

56:05.282 --> 56:09.620
I SUPPOSE YOU WANT FEEDING.

56:09.703 --> 56:11.330
NO REST, NO PEACE.

56:13.707 --> 56:16.752
WELL... SEE IF YOU LIKE THIS.

56:17.836 --> 56:19.463
YOU'LL FALL.

56:19.546 --> 56:23.050
HANSEL, GRETEL...

56:24.843 --> 56:27.263
IS THAT
THE WRONG WAY ROUND?

56:28.347 --> 56:29.265
WHO'S THAT?

56:29.348 --> 56:32.643
OH, IT'S YOU, IS IT?

56:32.685 --> 56:36.146
OH, DON'T WIPE
YOUR PAWS, WILL YOU!

56:36.230 --> 56:37.815
I'VE GOT NOBODY TO HELP
ME CLEAN, YOU KNOW.

56:37.856 --> 56:40.734
I HAVE TO DO ALL MYSELF.

56:40.776 --> 56:48.492
DO YOU REALIZE THAT TIRESOME SCHEHERAZADE
IS BARELY HALFWAY THROUGH HER 1,001 NIGHTS?

56:48.576 --> 56:53.455
I HAVE TO THINK OF ANOTHER
496 TALES BEFORE SHE'S SAFE.

56:53.539 --> 56:56.250
AND M'! DIARY IS CHOCK-A-BLOCK.

56:56.333 --> 57:00.588
LOOK! WEDNESDAY, A SEA JOURNEY TO
TAKE CARE OF A LITTLE MERMAID.

57:00.629 --> 57:04.758
FRIDAY... OH, THE UGLY
DUCKLING'S DUE TO HATCH.

57:04.842 --> 57:06.135
WELL, I HAVE TO BE
BACK FOR THAT.

57:06.176 --> 57:09.096
OH, DO BE QUIET, HENRIETTA.
I CAN'T THINK!

57:09.138 --> 57:10.889
NOW, WHAT'S THAT?

57:10.931 --> 57:16.478
AH! A NEW KEY CUT
FOR PANDORA' S BOX.

57:16.562 --> 57:19.148
WELL, IT'S ALL VERY WELL
FOR HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN

57:19.189 --> 57:21.609
TO SAY HIS LIFE
IS A FAIRY STORY.

57:21.650 --> 57:22.568
MINE ISN'T.

57:22.610 --> 57:25.154
NOTHING! ONE LONG SLOG!

57:25.237 --> 57:29.283
I CAN DO ALL MANNER OF THINGS
FOR OTHER PEOPLE,

57:29.366 --> 57:31.493
BUT NEVER ANYTHING FOR MYSELF.

57:31.535 --> 57:33.412
WATCH! YOU'D LIKE A BONE.

57:33.454 --> 57:36.040
SIMPLE. THERE YOU ARE.

57:36.123 --> 57:38.459
LET ME TRY IT FOR MYSELF.

57:38.542 --> 57:40.127
WOULD I LIKE A CUP OF TEA?

57:40.169 --> 57:42.129
YES, I WOULD.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

57:42.212 --> 57:43.714
NOW WATCH THIS.

57:43.797 --> 57:45.591
KETTLE, BOIL.

57:45.633 --> 57:47.968
SEE? DISASTER.

57:48.093 --> 57:51.305
NOW, WHAT'S HAPPENED
TO CINDERELLA?

58:22.002 --> 58:24.964
HOW FUNNY.

58:25.005 --> 58:25.965
I WAS JUST WISHING--

58:26.006 --> 58:28.008
YES. I KNOW.

58:29.510 --> 58:32.513
DO YOU MIND IF I MAKE
A VERY RUDE COMMENT?

58:33.514 --> 58:35.516
THESE ARE HOPELESS.

58:37.017 --> 58:39.228
THEY'RE WORSE
THAN HOPELESS.

58:40.854 --> 58:42.773
I'VE RUINED THEM.

58:42.856 --> 58:44.608
I'M GOING TO GET
INTO SUCH TROUBLE.

58:44.692 --> 58:47.486
NOW, WE DON'T WANT
ANY OF THAT.

58:47.528 --> 58:50.823
DRY YOUR TEARS
AND HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT.

58:50.864 --> 58:53.659
HMM. YOU LOOK
HALF-STARVED AND WORN OUT.

58:53.701 --> 58:56.287
I'M AFRAID THERE ISN'T
ANYTHING TO EAT.

58:56.370 --> 58:58.831
I WAS TOO BUSY DOING
THOSE TO COOK ANYTHING.

58:58.872 --> 59:00.374
WHAT'S THAT, THEN?

59:04.503 --> 59:05.879
WHERE DID THAT
COME FROM?

59:05.921 --> 59:08.173
AND WHERE DID
YOU COME FROM?

59:09.508 --> 59:10.801
I DON' T UNDERSTAND.

59:10.884 --> 59:14.263
NO. WELL, VERY FEW PEOPLE DO.

59:14.346 --> 59:16.265
YOU'RE NOT MEANT
TO UNDERSTAND IT.

59:16.348 --> 59:19.268
YOU'RE MEANT
TO ACCEPT IT GRACIOUSLY.

59:19.351 --> 59:21.604
NOW, LOOK.
I'M A VERY BUSY WOMAN,

59:21.687 --> 59:25.524
AND I SOMETIMES--
SOMETIMES LACK TACT.

59:25.566 --> 59:28.944
THE FIRST THING YOU MUST LEARN IN
LIFE IS NEVER TO GO BY APPEARANCES.

59:29.028 --> 59:33.782
THINGS ARE NEVER QUITE
WHAT YOU THINK THEY ARE.

59:33.866 --> 59:36.368
DO EAT UP; THAT'S
ONE OF MY BEST RECIPES.

59:38.203 --> 59:40.080
TAKE ME, FOR EXAMPLE.

59:40.164 --> 59:42.124
I'M NOT WHAT I SEEM.

59:42.207 --> 59:44.126
MIND YOU, I DON'T
DRESS THE PART

59:44.209 --> 59:45.628
AND FOR VERY GOOD REASON.

59:45.711 --> 59:48.255
HUMAN NATURE--OH, WELL,

59:48.297 --> 59:50.716
WE WON'T GO INTO WHAT
I THINK OF HUMAN NATURE,

59:50.758 --> 59:54.470
BUT IF I WERE TO Go ABOUT MY
BUSINESS ALL SPARKLE AND GLITTER,

59:54.553 --> 59:56.639
QUITE APART
FROM LOOKING ABSURD"

59:56.722 --> 59:59.141
BECAUSE DESPITE WHAT THEY WRITE
IN THOSE STORYBOOKS FOR CHILDREN,

59:59.224 --> 01:00:01.977
IT'S A MOST UNSUITABLE
COSTUME FOR A GROWN WOMAN--

01:00:02.061 --> 01:00:04.146
I SHOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO SORT OUT
THE WORTHY FROM THE UNWORTHY.

01:00:04.188 --> 01:00:05.231
DON' T YOU AGREE?

01:00:05.272 --> 01:00:07.858
I'M NOT SURE I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:13.364
I'M A... FAIRY GODMOTHER.

01:00:13.405 --> 01:00:14.490
HAVE BEEN ALL MY LIFE.

01:00:14.573 --> 01:00:18.160
AND PLEASE DON'T ASK
HOW I GOT INTO IT,

01:00:18.244 --> 01:00:19.995
BECAUSE IT'S A LONG STORY.

01:00:20.079 --> 01:00:21.997
HIGHLY IMPROBABLE...

01:00:22.081 --> 01:00:25.251
AND I SOMETIMES WISH
WE'D NEVER BEEN INVENTED.

01:00:25.292 --> 01:00:26.252
ARE THERE MANY OF YOU?

01:00:26.293 --> 01:00:27.336
NOT ENOUGH TO GO ROUND,

01:00:27.378 --> 01:00:30.673
JUDGING BY THE AMOUNT
OF WORK I HAVE TO DO.

01:00:30.756 --> 01:00:32.508
HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT?

01:00:32.591 --> 01:00:34.176
DELICIOUS.

01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:36.345
IT'S THE SAUCE, YOU KNOW.

01:00:36.428 --> 01:00:38.180
THAT OLD WIZARD MICHELIN
GAVE ME THE SECRET

01:00:38.264 --> 01:00:42.059
IN RETURN FOR 3 OF MY MAGIC
KNIVES AND FORKS. WHERE WAS I?

01:00:42.101 --> 01:00:46.188
YES! WELL, I HAVE
TO PUT PEOPLE TO THE TEST.

01:00:46.272 --> 01:00:47.690
NOW, YOU PASSED THE TEST.

01:00:47.773 --> 01:00:54.488
THOSE-THAT UNHOLY TRIO UPSTAIRS
I SIMPLY DIDN'T BOTHER WITH.

01:00:54.572 --> 01:00:56.865
NOT WORTH THE EFFORT.

01:00:56.949 --> 01:00:59.535
HOWEVER, TO WORK.

01:00:59.577 --> 01:01:02.204
BEST THAT YOU CAN DO
IS GET A GOOD NIGHTS REST.

01:01:06.709 --> 01:01:08.168
NO'! YOU.

01:01:08.210 --> 01:01:11.005
I DIDN'T INCLUDE YOU.
YOU'VE GOT WORK TO DO.

01:01:16.552 --> 01:01:17.928
WM.

01:01:19.388 --> 01:01:22.391
AH. LET ME CONCENTRATE.

01:01:27.521 --> 01:01:30.983
WHAT ARE THEY WEARING
IN PARIS THESE DAYS?

01:01:31.066 --> 01:01:33.652
I CAN'T KEEP UP
WITH FASHION.

01:01:33.694 --> 01:01:36.697
WELL, HAVE YOU GOT
ANY IDEAS?

01:01:37.907 --> 01:01:41.577
OH, CONCENTRATE.
CONCENTRATE.

01:02:06.227 --> 01:02:09.813
Stepmother: OF COURSE,
IT IS NOT WHAT I AM USED TO,

01:02:09.855 --> 01:02:13.484
BUT I MUST SAY, YOU HAVE MADE A
REASONABLE JOB OF STITCHING THIS.

01:02:13.567 --> 01:02:16.403
Palatine: I'M MAM'SA FAVORITE,
AND SHE PROMISED ME FIRST.

01:02:16.487 --> 01:02:17.988
GIRLS, IT IS
TIME TO LEAVE!

01:02:18.072 --> 01:02:20.324
WE MUST NOT KEEP
THE PRINCE WAITING.

01:02:21.575 --> 01:02:23.494
MAMA, I'VE JUST BEEN
TELLING PALATINE

01:02:23.577 --> 01:02:25.996
THAT SHE'S NOT TO
FEEL JEALOUS

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:28.540
IF THE PRINCE ASKS
ME TO DANCE FIRST.

01:02:28.582 --> 01:02:29.667
OH, MAMA!

01:02:29.708 --> 01:02:30.834
SHH.

01:02:30.918 --> 01:02:32.294
CINDERELLA,
STRAIGHTEN THAT HEM.

01:02:32.378 --> 01:02:34.380
Palatine: HOW DO
I LOOK, MAMA?

01:02:34.463 --> 01:02:36.340
DON'T I LOOK SUPERB?

01:02:36.382 --> 01:02:38.050
YOU BOTH LOOK
RAVISHING.

01:02:38.133 --> 01:02:41.845
IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR YOUR
POOR MAMA TO OUTSHINE YOU.

01:02:43.597 --> 01:02:45.349
WELL!

01:02:45.432 --> 01:02:48.894
COME, LET US DEPART.

01:02:54.066 --> 01:02:56.652
CLEAR UP THE MESS IN MY
BEDROOM, CINDERELLA.

01:02:56.735 --> 01:03:00.698
I DO NOT WANT TO COME HOME
AND FIND IT ALL UNTIDY.

01:03:04.535 --> 01:03:05.786
Cinderella:
HAVE A NICE TIME.

01:03:05.869 --> 01:03:07.788
Stepmother: YOU MAY
DEPEND ON THAT!

01:03:07.871 --> 01:03:09.832
Palatine: OH, MAMA,
WE LOOK WONDERFUL.

01:03:09.873 --> 01:03:11.125
Isabella: WELL, I DO.

01:03:11.208 --> 01:03:12.585
Stepmother:
COME, GIRLS.

01:03:54.293 --> 01:03:55.669
Man: YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS,

01:03:55.753 --> 01:03:59.006
MY LORDS,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

01:03:59.089 --> 01:04:04.553
HER SERENE HIGHNESS
THE PRINCESS MARIA OF TUSCANY.

01:04:09.850 --> 01:04:14.897
THE GRAND DUCHESS SOFIA
ELIZABETH OF DIETRICHSTEIN.

01:04:17.024 --> 01:04:22.238
HER IMPERIAL HIGHNESS
PRINCESS ALEXANDRE.

01:04:44.551 --> 01:04:46.178
OH, WHY NOT?

01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:48.597
I'LL JUST MAKE TIME.

01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:56.021
YES. YES,
JUST AS I THOUGHT.

01:04:56.063 --> 01:04:59.149
SITTING ALL ALONE FEELING
SORRY FOR OURSELVES, ARE WE?

01:04:59.233 --> 01:05:01.944
WELL, THAT'S
UNDERSTANDABLE, I SUPPOSE,

01:05:02.027 --> 01:05:05.114
THOUGH I NEVER CARED MUCH FOR
THESE ROYAL OCCASIONS MYSELF--

01:05:05.197 --> 01:05:07.616
TOO FORMAL, AND NOT
ENOUGH TO EAT OR DRINK.

01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:11.787
STILL, I DARESAY IN YOUR HEART
OF HEARTS YOU'D LIKE TO GO.

01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:13.122
GO?

01:05:13.163 --> 01:05:14.790
ME Go TO THE BALL?

01:05:14.873 --> 01:05:16.166
WELL, OF COURSE.

01:05:16.208 --> 01:05:18.961
THAT WHAT YOU WERE
WISHING, ISN'T IT?

01:05:19.044 --> 01:05:20.921
NOT WISHING,
EXACTLY,

01:05:21.046 --> 01:05:23.257
BUT THINKING WHAT

MISERABLE FIRE.

01:05:36.562 --> 01:05:37.938
YOU SHALL Go
TO THE BALL.

01:05:38.022 --> 01:05:39.982
I JUST HOPE I HAVEN'T
STRETCHED EVERYTHING TOO FAR

01:05:40.065 --> 01:05:41.525
AND THAT I CAN
MAKE IT WORK.

01:05:41.567 --> 01:05:43.444
MY POWERS ARE NOT
UNLIMITED, YOU KNOW.

01:05:43.569 --> 01:05:44.820
NO, I DIDN'T KNOW.

01:05:44.904 --> 01:05:46.530
OH, I HAVE TO
SHARE THEM OUT.

01:05:46.572 --> 01:05:48.908
NOW, LET ME THINK.

01:05:50.868 --> 01:05:54.997

So OFF YOU Go.

01:06:11.847 --> 01:06:13.641
OH, AND YOU.

01:06:13.682 --> 01:06:15.351
TAKE THEM WITH YOU, DOG,

01:06:15.434 --> 01:06:18.896
AND SEE IF YOU CAN ROUND UP
A FROG OR A LIZARD.

01:06:18.979 --> 01:06:22.191
NOW, THEN, I MUST DO
SOMETHING ABOUT YOU.

01:06:28.489 --> 01:06:31.325
IT DOESN'T
ALWAYS WORK, THIS,

01:06:31.367 --> 01:06:34.203
BUT THEN,
I HAVE BEEN LUCKY.

01:06:36.205 --> 01:06:38.499

ENOUGH REASONS.

RIDICULOUS CHARADE.

AMAZED MYSELF.

THINK IT ODD?

01:22:40.669 --> 01:22:42.087

01:22:46.508 --> 01:22:47.843
WHY?

01:22:49.470 --> 01:22:50.763
MUST YOU
ASK THAT?

01:22:50.846 --> 01:22:52.139
YES, I MUST.

01:22:56.352 --> 01:22:58.229

MUCH OF YOU.

01:22:58.270 --> 01:22:59.521
GOOD OR BAD?

01:22:59.563 --> 01:23:00.856
OH, NOTHING
BUT GOOD.

01:23:00.940 --> 01:23:02.191
I CAN'T THINK HOW.

01:23:02.233 --> 01:23:05.236

BELIEVED THE WORST.

01:23:05.277 --> 01:23:06.862

I WAS EXPECTING--

01:23:06.904 --> 01:23:09.531

MY WORLD BECAME
A MAGIC BLENDING

01:28:50.915 --> 01:28:53.918
OF DREAMS
AND HOPES AND LOVE

01:28:53.959 --> 01:28:59.757
WHEN HE DANCED
WITH ME

01:28:59.798 --> 01:29:08.182
THOUGH THIS LOVELY NIGHT WAS
ONLY A FANTASY

01:29:08.265 --> 01:29:17.024
AND I KNOW TONIGHT IS
ALL THERE WILL EVER BE

01:29:17.066 --> 01:29:22.571
DANCING
IN HIS ARMS FOREVER

01:29:22.613 --> 01:29:28.827
MY HEART
WILL NEVER BE FREE

01:29:28.911 --> 01:29:36.335
'DREAMING OF THE NIGHT
HE DANCED WITH ME

01:30:12.496 --> 01:30:17.084
RAINBOWS RACED
AROUND THE ROOM

01:30:17.126 --> 01:30:22.840
WHEN SHE DANCED
WITH ME

01:30:22.882 --> 01:30:27.177
SHOOTING STARS
BEGAN TO ZOOM

01:30:27.261 --> 01:30:32.933
WHEN SHE DANCED
WITH ME

01:30:33.017 --> 01:30:37.855
IN HER ARMS
I WAS ASCENDING

01:30:37.897 --> 01:30:42.860
AT LAST I SAW
THAT PERFECT BLENDING

01:30:42.902 --> 01:30:46.739
OF DREAMS
AND HOPES AND LOVE

01:30:46.822 --> 01:30:56.123
WHEN SHE DANCED
WITH ME

01:30:56.206 --> 01:31:05.925
COULD IT BE THAT SHE WAS
ONLY A FANTASY?

01:31:05.966 --> 01:31:10.971
COULD IT BE TONIGHT IS
ALL THERE WILL EVER BE?

01:31:16.435 --> 01:31:21.941
DANCING
IN HER ARMS FOREVER

01:31:21.982 --> 01:31:29.240
MY HEART
WILL NEVER BE FREE

01:31:29.323 --> 01:31:34.328
DREAMING OF THE NIGHT
SHE DANCED WITH ME

01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:45.965
'DREAMING OF THE NIGHT
SHE DANCED WITH ME

01:32:12.037 --> 01:32:14.373
Stepmother:
CINDERELLA!

01:32:16.583 --> 01:32:19.336
WHERE IS
THAT WRETCHED GIRL?

01:32:19.378 --> 01:32:22.131
CINDERELLA!

01:32:22.214 --> 01:32:23.674
YES, STEPMOTHER?

01:32:23.715 --> 01:32:25.509
THERE YOU ARE.

01:32:25.551 --> 01:32:28.637
WHY DO YOU NOT COME
WHEN I CALL?

01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:32.516
I WANT A WEAK
INFUSION OF TEA.

01:32:32.558 --> 01:32:35.853
MY HEAD IS FIT
FOR CRACKING.

01:32:39.398 --> 01:32:41.525
GOOD MORNING,
MAMA.

01:32:41.567 --> 01:32:43.360
MORNING, MAMA.

01:32:43.402 --> 01:32:44.653
BRING
THE BREAKFAST.

01:32:44.736 --> 01:32:46.572
IMMEDIATELY,
CINDERELLA.

01:32:48.073 --> 01:32:49.658
I WASN'T ABLE
TO SLEEP.

01:32:49.741 --> 01:32:53.620
OH, OH, THE EXCITEMENT
OF LAST NIGHT!

01:32:53.704 --> 01:32:56.748
NOT ON THE BED,
MY PRECIOUS.

01:32:56.790 --> 01:32:58.750
Palatine: YOU WOULD
HAVE BEEN AMAZED.

01:32:58.792 --> 01:33:02.463
YOUR STEPSISTERS
WERE A TRIUMPH.

01:33:02.504 --> 01:33:06.550
HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE LATE ARRIVAL
OF THAT MYSTERIOUS PRINCESS,

01:33:06.592 --> 01:33:11.221
I FEEL SURE THE PRINCE WOULD HAVE MADE
HIS CHOICE BETWEEN MY TWO ANGELS.

01:33:11.305 --> 01:33:13.223
WHAT PRINCESS WAS THAT?

01:33:13.265 --> 01:33:15.017
NOBODY SEEMED TO KNOW.

01:33:15.058 --> 01:33:17.311
HE SEEMED QUITE
TAKEN WITH HER,

01:33:17.394 --> 01:33:19.771
BUT THEN, MEN ALWAYS
Go FOR THE OBVIOUS.

01:33:19.813 --> 01:33:22.107
OH, YES.

01:33:22.149 --> 01:33:26.653
I MEAN, SHE WAS NOT
THAT PRETTY...

01:33:26.695 --> 01:33:29.573
STRIKING, PERHAPS.

01:33:29.615 --> 01:33:31.825
Isobella: DON'T
FORGET M'! BREAKFAST.

01:33:31.867 --> 01:33:33.577
Stepmother:
BREAKFAST.

01:33:33.660 --> 01:33:35.329
THINK, MAMA--

01:33:35.412 --> 01:33:39.500
WE WERE ACTUALLY
THERE AT THE CASTLE.

01:33:39.583 --> 01:33:42.503
WHERE YOU BELONG,
MY DEAR.

01:33:42.586 --> 01:33:45.839
I WONDER WHAT THE
PRINCE IS DOING TODAY?

01:33:45.923 --> 01:33:49.009
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THE PRINCE
IS GOING TO DO TODAY.

01:33:49.051 --> 01:33:52.930
THE PRINCE IS GOING TO EXERCISE
HIS ROYAL PREROGATIVE FOR ONCE.

01:33:53.013 --> 01:33:54.264
King: LEAVE US.

01:33:54.306 --> 01:33:56.266
No, STAY. I WANT YOU
TO HEAR THIS.

01:33:56.350 --> 01:33:59.812
I'M SICK AND TIRED OF BEING
TREATED LIKE SOME VILLAGE IDIOT!

01:33:59.853 --> 01:34:01.104
King: I'M GLAD YOU
STAYED TO HEAR THAT.

01:34:01.188 --> 01:34:02.773
AFTER ALL, HE IS THE
HEIR TO THE THRONE.

01:34:02.815 --> 01:34:05.984
FATHER, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
TREATS ME LIKE AN IDIOT.

01:34:06.026 --> 01:34:07.986
YOU ARRANGE A
BRIDE-FINDING BALL.

01:34:08.028 --> 01:34:10.989
AGAINST MY BETTER JUDGMENT,
I FALL IN WITH YOUR PLANS.

01:34:11.031 --> 01:34:12.491
I PLAY MY PART.

01:34:12.533 --> 01:34:15.953
I GREET, I'M POLITE,
I DANCE WITH, I FLATTER,

01:34:16.036 --> 01:34:19.832
I CONCEAL MY BOREDOM FROM HALF A DOZEN
TWITTERING MAIDENS OF BLUE BLOOD.

01:34:19.873 --> 01:34:21.959
IN SHORT, I FULFILL MY SIDE
OF THE BARGAIN.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:23.961
TRUE. I CAN 'T
FAULT HIM THERE.

01:34:24.002 --> 01:34:26.630
AND THEN, BY SOME MIRACLE, I
FIND THE LADY OF MY CHOICE,

01:34:26.672 --> 01:34:29.299
AND WHAT HAPPENS?
YOU FRIGHTEN HER AWAY!

01:34:29.341 --> 01:34:31.301
A SEARCH HAS BEEN MADE,
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.

01:34:31.343 --> 01:34:33.804
IS BEING MADE
EVEN AS WE SPEAK.

01:34:33.846 --> 01:34:35.097
OUR POLICE--

01:34:35.180 --> 01:34:36.974
OUR POLICE, FATHER, COULDN'T
FIND A MISSING HAYSTACK,

01:34:37.015 --> 01:34:39.268
LET ALONE A NEEDLE.

01:34:39.351 --> 01:34:41.645
HOW COULD SHE DISAPPEAR
WITHOUT A TRACE?

01:34:41.687 --> 01:34:44.314
DO WE NOT HAVE FRONTIERS,
CUSTOMS POSTS, GUARDS?

01:34:44.356 --> 01:34:45.983
WE HAVE CUSTOMS,
OF COURSE.

01:34:46.066 --> 01:34:47.860
VALUABLE SOURCE
OF REVENUE.

01:34:47.901 --> 01:34:50.529
AND MOST PEOPLE SAY THAT OUR
POLICEMEN ARE WONDERFUL.

01:34:50.571 --> 01:34:53.949
THIS IS APPARENTLY THE ONLY
CLUE WE HAVE, AND I FOUND IT.

01:34:53.991 --> 01:34:55.284
IT'S REMARKABLY DAINTY.

01:34:55.367 --> 01:34:56.618
EXACTLY.

01:34:58.370 --> 01:35:01.373
IT'S UNIQUE...
LIKE ITS VANISHED OWNER.

01:35:02.875 --> 01:35:04.626
THEREFORE, WE MUST USE IT.

01:35:06.211 --> 01:35:09.882
WHOEVER FITS THE SLIPPER
MUST FIT THE BILL!

01:35:11.508 --> 01:35:14.261
HE'S RIGHT.
HE'S RIGHT!

01:35:14.344 --> 01:35:17.306
WHOEVER FITS THIS SLIPPER
SHALL MARRY MY SON!

01:35:17.389 --> 01:35:19.808
YOUR MAJESTY, YOU HAVE
SOLVED THE PROBLEM.

01:35:19.892 --> 01:35:20.976
QUITE So.

01:35:21.059 --> 01:35:22.311
NOW, WE MUST ACT--

01:35:22.394 --> 01:35:23.604
UH, YOU MUST ACT.

01:35:23.687 --> 01:35:25.647
UM, THIS SLIPPER
MUST BE TAKEN

01:35:25.731 --> 01:35:28.650
TO EVERY STRANGER
OF NOTE IN THE LAND.

01:35:28.692 --> 01:35:30.486
THIS REALLY IS--

01:35:30.569 --> 01:35:32.988
IT REALLY IS
VERY DAINTY.

01:35:33.071 --> 01:35:34.990
UM, THE YOUNG LADY
ARRIVED INCOGNITA

01:35:35.073 --> 01:35:37.034
BUT MUST OBVIOUSLY BE
OF SOME CONSEQUENCE.

01:35:37.075 --> 01:35:39.328
SHE CANNOT REMAIN
UNKNOWN FOREVER.

01:35:39.411 --> 01:35:40.954
A PROCLAMATION
IS REQUIRED, SIRE.

01:35:41.038 --> 01:35:42.664
YES. DRAFT IT
IMMEDIATELY.

01:35:42.748 --> 01:35:45.167
BE IT KNOWN THAT IT IS
OUR ROYAL WILL

01:35:45.250 --> 01:35:47.836
TO FIND THE OWNER OF
THIS CHARMING, UH"

01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:49.838
HALF THE SIZE
OF YOUR MOTHER'S--

01:35:49.922 --> 01:35:51.882
THIS GLASS SLIPPER,
ET CETERA, ET CETERA.

01:35:51.924 --> 01:35:53.759
YOU'D BETTER
TAKE IT WITH YOU.

01:35:53.801 --> 01:35:55.219
VERY DISTURBING.

01:35:55.260 --> 01:35:58.430
HMM. I'M PROUD
OF YOU, EDWARD.

01:36:00.182 --> 01:36:03.435
BY ROYAL COMMAND
OF HIS MAJESTY THE KING,

01:36:03.477 --> 01:36:05.270
KNOW THIS--

01:36:05.354 --> 01:36:08.732
THAT WHOSOEVER SHALL TRY ON
THIS SLIPPER

01:36:08.774 --> 01:36:12.110
AND FIND IT A PERFECT FIT,

01:36:12.194 --> 01:36:14.488
THEN, BY ROYAL DECREE,

01:36:14.530 --> 01:36:16.782
SHE SHALL BE GIVEN
IN MARRIAGE

01:36:16.865 --> 01:36:20.953
TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS
THE PRINCE EDWARD OF EUPHRANIA,

01:36:20.994 --> 01:36:22.955
HEIR TO THE THRONE.

01:36:23.038 --> 01:36:25.874
GOD SAVE THE KING!

01:36:28.418 --> 01:36:29.419
PUSH! PUSH!

01:36:29.461 --> 01:36:31.130
OH, I AM PUSHING, MAMA!

01:36:31.171 --> 01:36:33.132
IT DOESN'T FIT.
LET ME TRY.

01:36:33.215 --> 01:36:34.842
OOH...

01:36:35.968 --> 01:36:38.428
NOW, PUSH HARD!

01:36:43.684 --> 01:36:45.310
Edward:
HAVE YOU FOUND HER?

01:36:45.394 --> 01:36:47.521
ANY SIGN OF HER AT ALL?

01:36:47.563 --> 01:36:48.981
AND YOU?

01:36:49.064 --> 01:36:50.899
AND YOU?

01:37:19.370 --> 01:37:20.496
SIR?

01:37:20.538 --> 01:37:21.914
HMM?

01:37:21.997 --> 01:37:23.999
I DON'T CARE
WHAT ANYONE SAYS.

01:37:24.041 --> 01:37:26.043
I KNOW SHE EXISTS.

01:37:29.839 --> 01:37:31.632
THE SLIPPER
WILL REMAIN THERE

01:37:31.715 --> 01:37:34.718
AS A MONUMENT TO
MY LOST LOVE.

01:37:41.392 --> 01:37:44.019
Edward:
HOW ABSURD LIFE IS.

01:37:44.019 --> 01:37:46.313
DOWN THERE, EVERYTHING
IS So SIMPLE.

01:37:46.397 --> 01:37:48.858
PEOPLE MEET,
FALL IN LOVE,

01:37:48.899 --> 01:37:50.276
MARRY,
AND HAVE CHILDREN.

01:37:51.694 --> 01:37:53.946
I DARESAY
THEY ENVY ME HERE.

01:37:54.029 --> 01:37:58.826
I'M TOLD ENVY OF PRINCES
IS A COMMON ENOUGH THING.

01:38:19.597 --> 01:38:23.559
Edward: 3 MONTHS,
6 DAYS, 10 HOURS.

01:38:23.601 --> 01:38:27.313
THAT'S HOW LONG IT'S BEEN
SINCE LAST I SAW HER.

01:38:27.396 --> 01:38:29.982
WHAT TORTURE LOVE IS!

01:38:30.065 --> 01:38:31.734
YES.

01:38:33.235 --> 01:38:36.155
OH, HOW SELFISH OF ME.
FORGIVE ME, JOHN.

01:38:36.197 --> 01:38:38.157
HAVE YOU SEEN
YOUR LADY CAROLINE?

01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:39.992
OH, YES...

01:38:40.075 --> 01:38:41.577
INFREQUENTLY.

01:38:44.246 --> 01:38:46.040
WHAT TORTURE LOVE IS.

01:38:51.420 --> 01:38:55.174
YOU SEE, SIR, IF MY FATHER
WERE A CHANCELLOR...

01:38:55.257 --> 01:38:58.219
HOW EASY IT WOULD BE

01:38:58.260 --> 01:39:01.597
THE LOVELY
LADY CAROLINE

01:39:01.639 --> 01:39:04.934
WOULD BE A PROPER
WIFE, YOU SEE

01:39:05.017 --> 01:39:07.228
BUT MY FATHER
WAS A SERVANT

01:39:07.269 --> 01:39:10.648
AND MY MOTHER
SAME AS HE

01:39:10.731 --> 01:39:15.027
So THE LADY
OF MY CHOOSING

01:39:15.111 --> 01:39:18.948
IS A WORLD AWAY
FROM ME

01:39:18.989 --> 01:39:20.950
THAT'S HOW IT IS

01:39:20.991 --> 01:39:23.077
AND HOW IT WAS

01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:29.875
AND HOW IT
ALWAYS SHALL BE

01:39:29.959 --> 01:39:32.795
POSITION
AND POSITIONING

01:39:32.878 --> 01:39:35.172
ARE SOCIALLY
CONDITIONING

01:39:35.256 --> 01:39:38.008
HOW YOU'RE BORN,
HOW YOU'RE BRED

01:39:38.092 --> 01:39:40.261
PREDETERMINE
WHO YOU WED

01:39:40.302 --> 01:39:43.139
WHICH MEANS THERE'S
NOTHING CHANGEABLE

01:39:43.180 --> 01:39:45.349
NOTHING'S
REARRANGEABLE

01:39:45.391 --> 01:39:47.810
POSITION
AND POSITIONING

01:39:47.852 --> 01:39:51.522
ARE EVERYTHING
IN LIFE

01:39:51.564 --> 01:39:53.816
FARMERS' DAUGHTERS
MARRY COW HERDS

01:39:53.858 --> 01:39:56.652
THAT'S ACCEPTABLE
AND RIGHT YES.

01:39:56.694 --> 01:39:59.572
BUT ABSURD
AND QUITE UNHEARD OF

01:39:59.655 --> 01:40:02.992
IS A MILK MAID
AND A KNIGHT

01:40:03.075 --> 01:40:05.286
I QUITE AGREE

01:40:05.327 --> 01:40:06.787
HE QUITE AGREES

01:40:06.829 --> 01:40:08.330
SHE QUITE
AGREES

01:40:08.372 --> 01:40:13.836
THAT'S HOW IT
ALWAYS SHALL BE

01:40:15.087 --> 01:40:17.506
POSITION AND
POSITIONING

01:40:17.590 --> 01:40:19.884
ARE SOCIALLY
CONDITIONING

01:40:19.967 --> 01:40:22.303
PEOPLE HIGH,
PEOPLE LOW

01:40:22.344 --> 01:40:24.555
KEEP THE STATE
OF STATUS QUO

01:40:24.597 --> 01:40:26.974
WHICH MEANS THERE'S
NOTHING CHANGEABLE

01:40:27.016 --> 01:40:29.185
NOTHING'S REARRANGEABLE

01:40:29.268 --> 01:40:31.520
POSITION
AND POSITIONING

01:40:31.562 --> 01:40:34.482
ARE EVERYTHING
IN LIFE

01:40:34.565 --> 01:40:36.776
WHEN A LAD FIRST
JOINS THE ARMY

01:40:36.859 --> 01:40:38.444
THIS IS WHAT HE
LEARNS FOR STARTERS

01:40:38.527 --> 01:40:40.946
NEVER COURT YOUR
COLONEL'S DAUGHTER

01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:43.365
OR HE'LL HAVE YOUR GUTS
FOR GARTERS

01:40:43.407 --> 01:40:45.367
THAT'S HOW IT IS

01:40:45.451 --> 01:40:47.077
AND HOW IT WAS

01:40:47.161 --> 01:40:52.374
AND HOW IT ALWAYS
SHALL BE

01:40:52.458 --> 01:40:55.961
John: FOR POSITION
AND POSITIONING

01:40:56.045 --> 01:40:58.214
ARE SOCIALLY
CONDITIONING

01:40:58.339 --> 01:41:00.341
HOW YOU DRESS
AND HOLD YOUR HEAD

01:41:00.382 --> 01:41:02.176
PREDETERMINE
WHO YOU WED

01:41:02.259 --> 01:41:04.386
WHICH MEANS THERE'S
NOTHING CHANGEABLE

01:41:04.428 --> 01:41:06.180
NOTHING'S
REARRANGEABLE

01:41:06.222 --> 01:41:08.140
POSITION AND
POSITIONING

01:41:08.224 --> 01:41:10.142
ARE EVERYTHING
IN LIFE

01:41:10.226 --> 01:41:12.061
ALL THE SERVANTS
IN A CASTLE

01:41:12.144 --> 01:41:14.188
THEY REFLECT
THE WORLD OUTSIDE

01:41:14.230 --> 01:41:16.190
THEY HAVE RANK
AND THEY HAVE STATION

01:41:16.232 --> 01:41:18.192
AND ADHERE TO THEM
WITH PRIDE

01:41:18.234 --> 01:41:20.194
OH, THE STAFF THAT WORK
BELOW STAIRS

01:41:20.236 --> 01:41:21.987
THEY HAVE DREAMS
TO WORK ABOVE

01:41:22.071 --> 01:41:23.864
AND THEY'RE LOCKED
IN THEIR POSITIONS

01:41:23.906 --> 01:41:26.492
BY TRADITION'S
IRON GLOVE

01:41:26.575 --> 01:41:27.660
THAT'S HOW IT IS?

01:41:27.743 --> 01:41:29.411
AND HOW IT WAS

01:41:29.453 --> 01:41:34.208
AND HOW IT ALWAYS
SHALL BE

01:41:34.250 --> 01:41:36.085
WE KNOW OUR PLACE,
AND HAPPILY

01:41:36.168 --> 01:41:38.045
WE BOW AND SCRAPE
AND BEND OUR KNEE

01:41:38.087 --> 01:41:39.547
BUT WOE BETIDE
THE WOE BEGONE

01:41:39.588 --> 01:41:41.757
WHO TRY TO JOIN
OUR ECHELON

01:41:41.841 --> 01:41:43.759
FOR PRIVILEGE
IS NOT, YOU SEE

01:41:43.801 --> 01:41:45.803
CONFINED TO JUST
THE ROYALTY

01:41:45.845 --> 01:41:47.638
BEHIND THESE DOORS,
I MIGHT SUGGEST

01:41:47.721 --> 01:41:49.348
I'M SIMILARLY BLESSED

01:41:49.431 --> 01:41:51.267
Chorus: YES, POSITION
AND POSITIONING

01:41:51.350 --> 01:41:53.310
ARE SOCIALLY
CONDITIONING

01:41:53.352 --> 01:41:55.104
THOUGH YOU WORK
YOUR LIFE AWAY

01:41:55.146 --> 01:41:56.856
WHERE YOU START
IS WHERE YOU STAY

01:41:56.939 --> 01:41:58.816
WHICH MEANS THERE'S
NOTHING CHANGEABLE

01:41:58.899 --> 01:42:00.526
NOTHING' S
REARRANGEABLE

01:42:00.609 --> 01:42:02.153
POSITION AND
POSITIONING

01:42:02.236 --> 01:42:03.696
ARE STUCK WITH YOU
FOR LIFE

01:44:37.850 --> 01:44:41.061
POSITION AND
POSITIONING

01:44:41.103 --> 01:44:44.815
ARE SOCIALLY
CONDITIONING

01:44:44.857 --> 01:44:48.027
THOUGH YOU WORK
YOUR LIFE AWAY

01:44:48.110 --> 01:44:50.613
WHERE YOU START
IS WHERE YOU STAY

01:44:50.696 --> 01:44:52.865
WHICH MEANS THERE'S
NOTHING CHANGEABLE

01:44:52.948 --> 01:44:54.325
NOTHING' S
REARRANGEABLE

01:44:54.366 --> 01:44:55.993
POSITION AND
POSITIONING

01:44:56.076 --> 01:44:57.703
ARE EVERYTHING
IN LIFE

01:44:57.787 --> 01:44:59.705
EVERYTHING IN LIFE

01:44:59.747 --> 01:45:00.915
EVERYTHING
IN LIFE

01:45:00.956 --> 01:45:04.084
I LIFE, LIFE, LIFE,
LIFE, LIFE, LIFE I

01:45:14.136 --> 01:45:16.263
THAT'S HOW IT IS?
AND HOW IT WAS.

01:45:16.305 --> 01:45:20.726
AND HOW IT
ALWAYS SHALL BE

01:45:22.394 --> 01:45:24.355
Edward: ALL RIGHT,
YOU'VE CONVINCED ME,

01:45:24.396 --> 01:45:26.315
BUT I SHALL
PROVE YOU WRONG,

01:45:26.357 --> 01:45:27.817
FOR PRINCES,
WHEN CONVINCED,

01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:29.527
TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THEIR POSITION.

01:45:29.568 --> 01:45:32.822
I CAN'T THINK WHY I DIDN'T DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT BEFORE.

01:45:32.905 --> 01:45:34.198
John I ABOUT WHAT?

01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:36.325
WAIT, AND ALL
WILL BE REVEALED.

01:45:36.367 --> 01:45:37.993
KNEEL.

01:45:38.077 --> 01:45:39.203
WHAT? ME?

01:45:39.245 --> 01:45:41.163
I COMMAND IT.

01:45:41.205 --> 01:45:45.000
I DUB THEE, AS IS MY
PRIVILEGE SO TO DO,

01:45:45.084 --> 01:45:47.336
A KNIGHT OF THE ORDER
OF SAINT DAVID.

01:45:47.378 --> 01:45:49.547
ARISE, SIR JOHN.

01:45:49.588 --> 01:45:51.507
AS A KNIGHT
OF THE REALM,

01:45:51.549 --> 01:45:53.592
YOU CAN NOW CLAIM THE HAND
OF THE FAIR LADY CAROLINE--

01:45:53.676 --> 01:45:55.928
WHICH IS FORTUNATE
FOR YOU BUT WHICH, ALAS,

01:45:56.011 --> 01:45:58.597
LEAVES ME WITHOUT
A COMPANION-AT-ARMS.

01:45:58.681 --> 01:46:00.015
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

01:46:01.851 --> 01:46:03.853
UH, WILLOUGHBY,
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.

01:46:03.894 --> 01:46:05.437
CAN HE NOT ANSWER
FOR HIMSELF?

01:46:05.521 --> 01:46:07.481
IT'S NOT HIS
POSITIOH, YOU SEE.

01:46:07.523 --> 01:46:08.607
AH, TRUE.

01:46:08.691 --> 01:46:10.151
BUT IT WILL BE.

01:46:10.192 --> 01:46:12.361
I SHALL ELEVATE YOU, TOO,
WILLOUGHBY.

01:46:12.403 --> 01:46:15.322
FROM HENCEFORTH, YOU ARE MY
PERSONAL COMPANION-AT-ARMS,

01:46:15.364 --> 01:46:17.867
WITH ALL THE PRIVILEGES
SUCH OFFICE BESTOWS.

01:46:17.950 --> 01:46:19.410
YOU WILL NEED
A SWORD.

01:46:19.452 --> 01:46:21.203
HERE.

01:46:21.245 --> 01:46:23.080
TAKE MINE.

01:46:24.874 --> 01:46:26.667
IT GOES THE OTHER
WAY AROUND.

01:46:26.709 --> 01:46:28.169
HELP HIM, WILL YOU?

01:46:28.210 --> 01:46:30.296
WELL, THAT'S A GOOD
MORNING'S WORK.

01:46:30.379 --> 01:46:32.298
John: CONGRATULATIONS,
WILLOUGHBY.

01:46:32.381 --> 01:46:35.301
AND CONGRATULATIONS
TO YOU, TOO, SIR JOHN.

01:46:35.384 --> 01:46:36.886
WHAT CAN I SAY?

01:46:36.927 --> 01:46:38.512
NOTHING.

01:46:38.554 --> 01:46:40.014
GO AND FIND HER.

01:46:40.097 --> 01:46:41.599
BE HAPPY.

01:46:48.147 --> 01:46:50.649
HAPPY ENOUGH
FOR BOTH OF US.

01:49:01.238 --> 01:49:03.199
I MUST FETCH THE PRINCE.

01:50:22.695 --> 01:50:24.321
THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!

01:50:24.405 --> 01:50:27.366
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN,
YOU WRETCHED GIRL? YOU...

01:50:28.909 --> 01:50:31.495
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.

01:50:38.127 --> 01:50:40.087
OH!
OH!

01:50:42.256 --> 01:50:45.718
I LITTLE KNEW, MADAM, THAT I WOULD
HAVE THE PLEASURE OF MEETING

01:50:45.801 --> 01:50:48.888
YOU AND YOUR DELIGHTFUL DAUGHTERS
AGAIN IN SUCH HAPPY CIRCUMSTANCES.

01:50:48.971 --> 01:50:52.266
WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES,
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS?

01:50:52.308 --> 01:50:55.978
YOU ARE THE LEGAL GUARDIAN, I
BELIEVE, OF MY WIFE TO BE.

01:50:57.438 --> 01:51:00.983
YOUR WIFE TO BE?

01:51:01.025 --> 01:51:04.487
WHY, YES. I AM MORE
THAN HER LEGAL GUARDIAN.

01:51:04.570 --> 01:51:07.406
I HAVE BEEN A MOTHER TO HER.

01:51:07.448 --> 01:51:10.034
THEN I DO RIGHT BY FORMALLY
ASKING YOUR PERMISSION

01:51:10.117 --> 01:51:11.660
TO TAKE CINDERELLA'S
HAND IN MARRIAGE.

01:51:11.702 --> 01:51:13.120
OH!
OH!

01:51:13.204 --> 01:51:15.122
CONTROL YOURSELVES !

01:51:15.164 --> 01:51:18.459
PERMISSION? WHY, OF COURSE!

01:51:18.542 --> 01:51:21.587
GLADLY! NATURALLY.

01:51:21.670 --> 01:51:24.131
I DON'T UNDERSTAND. DO I--

01:51:24.173 --> 01:51:26.759
WILL YOU BE QUIET?

01:51:26.842 --> 01:51:30.137
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS,
PLEASE ALLOW ME THE HONOR OF

01:51:30.179 --> 01:51:33.015
INVITING YOU INTO
OUR HAPPY HOME.

01:51:33.098 --> 01:51:36.936
COME, CINDERELLA, DEAR.
WE WERE So WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

01:51:37.019 --> 01:51:40.815
THANK YOU, BUT No, I HAVE OTHER
URGENT BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO.

01:51:44.985 --> 01:51:48.364
IN MY HAPPINESS,
I FORGIVE YOU ALL.

01:51:52.535 --> 01:51:54.954
FORGIVE ME?

01:51:55.037 --> 01:51:58.415
HOW DARE SHE FORGIVE ME?

01:52:22.022 --> 01:52:24.608
AND WHAT DO THEY CALL YOU?

01:52:24.650 --> 01:52:26.235
CINDERELLA,
YOUR MAJESTY.

01:52:26.318 --> 01:52:28.446
A MOST UNUSUAL NAME.

01:52:28.487 --> 01:52:30.990
Edward: THE NAME, MOTHER,
IS SURELY OF No IMPORTANCE.

01:52:31.073 --> 01:52:34.952
ALL THAT MATTERS IS THAT I'VE MADE MY
CHOICE AND WAIT FOR YOUR BLESSINGS.

01:52:35.035 --> 01:52:38.289
YOU GAVE US A LOT OF TROUBLE,
YOU KNOW, AFTER THE BALL.

01:52:38.330 --> 01:52:41.292
PEOPLE LOOKING FOR YOU
EVERYWHERE. VANISHED, YOU SEE.

01:52:41.375 --> 01:52:44.128
DID YOU Go BACK
TO YOUR OWN KINGDOM?

01:52:44.211 --> 01:52:47.047
NO, YOUR MAJESTY. I WENT
BACK TO WHERE I LIVE.

01:52:47.131 --> 01:52:48.674
AND WHERE IS THAT, CHILD?

01:52:48.757 --> 01:52:49.717
WHY, HERE,
YOUR MAJESTY.

01:52:49.800 --> 01:52:52.470
HERE? IN THE CASTLE?

01:52:52.511 --> 01:52:55.806
No, FATHER. AS YOU'VE OFTEN
REMARKED, LOVE IS BLIND.

01:52:55.848 --> 01:52:57.975
AND WE SOMETIMES DON'T LOOK
UNDER OUR NOSES.

01:52:58.058 --> 01:53:01.437
CINDERELLA LIVES IN OUR OWN
EUPHRANIA, NOT 20 MILES FROM HERE.

01:53:01.479 --> 01:53:03.522
WHO IS THIS GIRL?

01:53:03.606 --> 01:53:07.234
WHY DOESN'T SOMEBODY TELL
ME WHAT IS GOING ON?

01:53:07.318 --> 01:53:11.113
THIS IS THE GIRL THAT
EDWARD WANTS TO MARRY.

01:53:11.155 --> 01:53:12.615
IS GOING TO
MARRY, FATHER.

01:53:12.698 --> 01:53:15.367
I DON'T WISH TO
SEEM OFFENSIVE,

01:53:15.451 --> 01:53:18.287
BUT IT DOES SEEM TO ME
THAT SHE'S MOST UNSUITABLY

01:53:18.329 --> 01:53:20.831
DRESSED FOR SUCH A
SOLEMN OCCASION.

01:53:20.915 --> 01:53:24.877
YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT, GRANDMAMA. IT'S
SOMETHING I SHALL CORRECT IMMEDIATELY.

01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:27.254
FATHER, BY YOUR LEAVE.

01:53:43.729 --> 01:53:45.356
King: QUESTIONS
OF PRECEDENT.

01:53:45.439 --> 01:53:47.108
UNPRECEDENTED
QUESTIONS OF PRECEDENT.

01:53:47.149 --> 01:53:48.609
MY OWN THOUGHT,
SIRE.

01:53:48.651 --> 01:53:50.569
A MEETING, I THINK.
THE STAFF COUNCIL.

01:53:50.653 --> 01:53:53.614
IT HAS ALREADY BEEN
CONVENED, YOUR MAJESTY.

01:53:53.656 --> 01:53:55.574
PITY. CHARMING
LITTLE THING.

01:53:55.658 --> 01:53:58.369
IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES...

01:53:58.410 --> 01:54:00.287
MOST APPEALING.

01:54:13.717 --> 01:54:15.427
WHO IS IT?

01:54:15.469 --> 01:54:19.140
MILADY, I'M COMMANDED
BY HIS MAJESTY THE KING

01:54:19.223 --> 01:54:21.183
TO REQUEST AN AUDIENCE.

01:54:21.225 --> 01:54:22.643
OH.

01:54:22.685 --> 01:54:24.854
ONE MOMENT, PLEASE.

01:54:29.191 --> 01:54:30.734
PLEASE ENTER.

01:54:35.739 --> 01:54:37.992
MI LORD CHAMBERLAIN.

01:54:38.033 --> 01:54:40.077
MILADY.

01:54:44.540 --> 01:54:48.127
FORGIVE ME FOR
DISTURBING YOUR REST...

01:54:49.628 --> 01:54:53.132
BUT, ALAS, THERE ARE
SOME MATTERS OF STATE

01:54:53.215 --> 01:54:54.675
THAT CANNOT BE DELAYED.

01:54:54.717 --> 01:54:59.221
HIS MAJESTY HAS REQUESTED ME,
AS HIS PRINCIPAL MINISTER...

01:54:59.263 --> 01:55:01.223
TO BROACH...

01:55:01.307 --> 01:55:03.809
A QUESTION OF
SOME DELICACY.

01:55:07.938 --> 01:55:09.440
I...

01:55:12.902 --> 01:55:15.654
YOU LOVE THE PRINCE EDWARD,
DO YOU NOT?

01:55:15.738 --> 01:55:17.865
WHY, OF COURSE.

01:55:17.948 --> 01:55:19.241
WHO WOULDN'T?

01:55:19.283 --> 01:55:20.743
OH, QUITE SO.

01:55:20.826 --> 01:55:22.828
UH, PLEASE. PLEASE.

01:55:24.288 --> 01:55:27.249
AND HE HAS EXPRESSED
HIS LOVE FOR YOU

01:55:27.333 --> 01:55:28.751
BEFORE THE WHOLE COURT.

01:55:28.834 --> 01:55:29.919
YES.

01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:31.378
YES, HE HAS.

01:55:31.462 --> 01:55:32.963
VERY COMMENDABLY.

01:55:34.423 --> 01:55:35.966
BIS MAKES...

01:55:39.804 --> 01:55:41.597
OH, DEAR.

01:55:41.639 --> 01:55:44.099
OH, DEAR. OH, DEAR.
OH, DEAR.

01:55:44.141 --> 01:55:47.144
I'M REALLY TOO OLD
FOR THIS SORT OF THING.

01:55:48.604 --> 01:55:51.065
FORGIVE ME,
MY DEAR CHILD, BUT...

01:55:51.107 --> 01:55:53.567
DESPITE MY APPEARANCE

01:55:53.609 --> 01:55:57.822
AND THE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE
OF MY HIGH OFFICE...

01:55:57.905 --> 01:56:01.867
I AM NOT WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING
OF YOUR PLIGHT.

01:56:03.452 --> 01:56:05.913
FOR PLIGHT IT IS.

01:56:05.955 --> 01:56:08.290
TO BE BLUNT,

01:56:08.332 --> 01:56:10.167
BECAUSE THE HOUR IS LATE.

01:56:10.251 --> 01:56:13.212
IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR HIS
MAJESTY TO GIVE CONSENT

01:56:13.295 --> 01:56:15.297
TO SUCH A MARRIAGE.

01:56:16.799 --> 01:56:18.759
NOT POSSIBLE?

01:56:22.721 --> 01:56:24.723
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

01:56:26.225 --> 01:56:27.893
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

01:56:27.977 --> 01:56:29.645
HMM. WELL...

01:56:32.731 --> 01:56:35.109
YOUR LOVE
FOR THE PRINCE

01:56:35.151 --> 01:56:37.111
AND HIS LOVE FOR YOU,

01:56:37.153 --> 01:56:41.240
WELL, THAT IS A FINE
AND PRIVATE THING.

01:56:41.323 --> 01:56:44.285
WOULD THAT IT COULD
REMAIN so,

01:56:44.326 --> 01:56:47.079
BUT THE TIMES DEMAND
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

01:56:47.163 --> 01:56:51.459
THE PRINCE MUST MAKE
A MARRIAGE OF ALLIANCE

01:56:51.500 --> 01:56:55.087
WITH A PRINCESS
OF THE BLOOD ROYAL.

01:56:55.171 --> 01:56:58.007
AND THAT IS WHY
I AM HERE,

01:56:58.090 --> 01:57:00.092
BURDENED WITH
THIS UNHAPPY TASK.

01:57:01.594 --> 01:57:03.554
YOU SEE,
MY DEAR CHILD,

01:57:03.596 --> 01:57:07.349
IN LIFE, LOVE CANNOT
ALWAYS FIND A WAY.

01:57:07.433 --> 01:57:09.351
YOU WERE BORN HERE,

01:57:09.393 --> 01:57:12.188
SO YOU KNOW THAT
OUR LITTLE KINGDOM,

01:57:12.229 --> 01:57:13.689
WHILST FAR FROM PERFECT,

01:57:13.731 --> 01:57:17.193
HAS YET ENJOYED COUNTLESS
CENTURIES OF PEACE.

01:57:17.234 --> 01:57:21.280
NOW THAT PEACE IS
THREATENED FROM WITHOUT.

01:57:21.363 --> 01:57:24.325
THERE ARE SOME WHO LOOK
TOWARDS OUR FRONTIERS

01:57:24.366 --> 01:57:25.868
WITH GREEDY EYES.

01:57:27.870 --> 01:57:31.290
YOU SEE ONLY LOVE
AND HAPPINESS

01:57:31.373 --> 01:57:34.418
STARING YOU IN THE FACE.

01:57:34.502 --> 01:57:39.131
I SEE NOTHING BUT WAR
AND DESTRUCTION...

01:57:40.674 --> 01:57:43.552
UNLESS A SACRIFICE
IS MADE.

01:57:50.059 --> 01:57:51.977
AND THE SACRIFICE...

01:57:52.103 --> 01:57:54.438
IS TO BE ME.

01:57:54.522 --> 01:57:55.940
YES.

01:57:56.023 --> 01:57:57.942
IT'S A LOT TO ASK,

01:57:58.025 --> 01:58:00.486
BUT I HAVE TO
ASK IT.

01:58:00.569 --> 01:58:02.113
TO LEAVE HIM NOW?

01:58:02.154 --> 01:58:03.572
TO LEAVE HIM NOW,

01:58:03.572 --> 01:58:05.658
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

01:58:05.741 --> 01:58:08.035
BUT HE WOULD
SEARCH FOR ME AGAIN.

01:58:08.077 --> 01:58:10.412
HE WOULD SEARCH
FOR ME AND FIND ME.

01:58:10.454 --> 01:58:11.956
I KNOW HE WOULD.

01:58:11.997 --> 01:58:13.916
YES. THAT, TOO,
IS TRUE,

01:58:13.958 --> 01:58:15.876
BUT WE'VE ALLOWED
FOR THAT.

01:58:15.918 --> 01:58:18.921
IT IS SUGGESTED
THAT WITH PROPER DOWRY

01:58:18.963 --> 01:58:20.881
AND EVERY OTHER
CONSIDERATION

01:58:20.923 --> 01:58:24.426
FITTING THE CIRCUMSTANCES
OF THIS MOST UNHAPPY OCCASION,

01:58:24.510 --> 01:58:28.931
IT IS SUGGESTED THAT YOU BE
TAKEN FROM HERE THIS VERY NIGHT

01:58:28.973 --> 01:58:33.602
TO A SECRET PLACE OF EXILE
FAR BEYOND OUR BORDERS.

01:58:35.104 --> 01:58:37.148
YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN
NOTHING, THEN.

01:58:39.608 --> 01:58:42.570
I THANK YOU FOR
BRINGING SUCH TIDINGS

01:58:42.611 --> 01:58:45.114
WITH TACT
AND UNDERSTANDING.

01:58:45.156 --> 01:58:48.784
YOU WERE WELL CHOSEN
FOR THE TASK.

01:58:51.787 --> 01:58:54.790
YOUR LADIES-IN-WAITING
WILL BE SENT FOR.

01:58:57.460 --> 01:59:00.421
BUT IN BOWING TO
THE ROYAL DEMANDS,

01:59:00.504 --> 01:59:03.632
I MUST MAKE ONE
OF MY OWN.

01:59:05.134 --> 01:59:06.886
MILADY?

01:59:06.969 --> 01:59:10.055
IT IS NOT VERY MUCH

01:59:10.139 --> 01:59:12.600
AND SOMETHING
WHICH...

01:59:12.641 --> 01:59:16.562
WITH YOUR GREATER EXPERIENCE
IN THESE MATTERS,

01:59:16.604 --> 01:59:19.648
YOU WILL NOT FIND
VERY DIFFICULT.

01:59:22.651 --> 01:59:25.654
I WISH YOU TO TELL HIS
ROYAL HIGHNESS...

01:59:27.239 --> 01:59:28.741
PRINCE EDWARD...

01:59:30.242 --> 01:59:33.078
I WISH
YOU'D TELL HIM...

01:59:33.162 --> 01:59:36.081
TELL HIM...

01:59:36.165 --> 01:59:39.126
TELL HIM THAT
IT WASN'T LOVE

01:59:39.168 --> 01:59:41.378
SAY I TRIED

01:59:41.462 --> 01:59:43.464
SAY I LIED

01:59:43.506 --> 01:59:47.301
TELL HIM
I'M UNWORTHY OF

01:59:47.343 --> 01:59:52.014
WHAT HE FEELS
INSIDE

01:59:52.097 --> 01:59:55.684
TELL HIM THAT
YOU HEARD ME SAY

01:59:55.726 --> 01:59:57.895
WHAT SEEMED RIGHT

01:59:57.937 --> 02:00:00.523
JUST LAST NIGHT

02:00:00.564 --> 02:00:04.735
SIMPLY SEEMED
TO FADE AWAY

02:00:04.819 --> 02:00:09.198
IN THE LIGHT OF DAY

02:00:10.658 --> 02:00:13.285
TELL HIM OF THE
COUNTLESS OTHER LOVERS

02:00:13.369 --> 02:00:15.621
WHOM I TANTALIZED,
VICTIMIZED

02:00:15.704 --> 02:00:17.706
TELL HIM OF
THE MANY OTHER TIMES

02:00:17.790 --> 02:00:19.416
I'VE PLAYED
THIS HEARTLESS GAME

02:00:19.458 --> 02:00:20.918
JUST TEE SAW'.

02:00:21.001 --> 02:00:23.963
'TELL HIM
WHAT I REALLY AM

02:00:24.004 --> 02:00:28.217
IS JUST A COLD
AND EMPTY SHAM

02:00:29.552 --> 02:00:33.430
TELL HIM ANYTHING

02:00:33.472 --> 02:00:42.940
BUT NOT
THAT I LOVE HIM

02:00:51.407 --> 02:00:54.827
TELL HIM THAT
IT WASN'T LOVE

02:00:54.869 --> 02:00:58.831
ALL WE SHARED,
ALL WE CARED

02:00:58.914 --> 02:01:03.127
MAKE HIM HATE
MY MEMORY

02:01:03.169 --> 02:01:07.339
MAKE HIM GLAD HE'S FREE

02:01:08.841 --> 02:01:12.720
PAINT ME EVIL,
PAINT ME CRUEL

02:01:12.761 --> 02:01:17.016
SAY I BROKE EVERY RULE

02:01:17.099 --> 02:01:21.979
MAKE HIM FEEL
THAT HE'S A FOOL

02:01:22.021 --> 02:01:26.734
FOR HIS LOVING ME

02:01:26.776 --> 02:01:32.406
DON'T LET HIM KNOW

02:01:32.448 --> 02:01:36.911
WHY I MUST LEAVE HIM

02:01:36.994 --> 02:01:41.415
WHY I MUS GO

02:01:41.457 --> 02:01:46.378
SO FAR AWAY

02:01:46.462 --> 02:01:52.676
FOR IF HE KNEW

02:01:52.718 --> 02:01:59.058
HOW MUCH I LOVE HIM

02:01:59.141 --> 02:02:05.439
NO POWER ON EARTH

02:02:06.857 --> 02:02:11.862
COULD MAKE HIM STAY

02:02:56.031 --> 02:02:57.491
YOUR MAJESTY.

02:03:05.708 --> 02:03:07.710
THE DEED IS DONE.

02:03:11.213 --> 02:03:15.426
SHE CERTAINLY BEHAVED
LIKE A PRINCESS.

02:03:24.018 --> 02:03:25.686
Edward: COME ON!

02:03:25.728 --> 02:03:26.729
THE FRONTIER!

02:04:18.739 --> 02:04:20.699
FATHER.

02:04:22.284 --> 02:04:25.246
FATHER, YOU HAVE DONE
WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

02:04:25.287 --> 02:04:27.915
THE SPOILS
ARE YOURS,

02:04:27.957 --> 02:04:30.417
BUT IT IS
A SMALL VICTORY.

02:04:30.459 --> 02:04:32.419
IF I COULD EXPLAIN...

02:04:32.503 --> 02:04:33.963
SPARE ME THAT.

02:04:34.004 --> 02:04:36.966
SPARE ME THE FINAL HYPOCRISY
OF YOUR SYMPATHY.

02:04:37.007 --> 02:04:39.468
TAKE YOUR MAP.

02:04:39.510 --> 02:04:41.470
REARRANGE IT TO YOUR
HEARTS CONTENT.

02:04:41.512 --> 02:04:43.305
MAKE YOUR PRECIOUS
MARRIAGE OF ALLIANCE.

02:04:43.389 --> 02:04:45.266
YOU'VE DESTROYED WHATEVER
VESTIGE OF LOVE AND HAPPINESS

02:04:45.307 --> 02:04:46.475
I MIGHT HAVE FOUND,

02:04:46.517 --> 02:04:48.894
AND YOU'VE DONE IT IN
THE NAME OF PATRIOTISM.

02:04:48.978 --> 02:04:51.397
SO... LET IT BE THUS.

02:04:51.480 --> 02:04:52.690
CHOOSE ME A BRIDE

02:04:52.773 --> 02:04:54.733
FROM AMONGST THE RAGBAG
OF ROYAL VIRGINS

02:04:54.775 --> 02:04:55.943
I HAVE TWICE
REJECTED.

02:04:56.026 --> 02:04:58.487
CHOOSE WHO YOU WILL.
I CARE NOT.

02:04:58.529 --> 02:05:00.990
I'LL PLAY MY PUBLIC
PART TO THE ALTAR

02:05:01.031 --> 02:05:02.616
BUT NO FURTHER.

02:05:02.658 --> 02:05:05.119
YOUR ROYAL HOUSE
WILL LIVE WITH YOU

02:05:05.161 --> 02:05:06.704
BUT DIE WITH ME.

02:06:17.483 --> 02:06:19.735
DEAR CINDERELLA,
FORGIVE ME.

02:06:21.987 --> 02:06:25.908
I HAVE NO HEART FOR WHAT
I MUST SHORTLY PERFORM.

02:06:25.991 --> 02:06:28.994
MY HEART IS YOURS
AND YOURS ALONE.

02:06:30.621 --> 02:06:35.543
I WOULD NOT HAVE YOU GRIEVE
FOR WHAT WAS NOT TO BE.

02:06:35.584 --> 02:06:38.045
IT'S ONLY IN FAIRY TALES

02:06:38.087 --> 02:06:40.506
THAT THE PRINCE...

02:06:40.589 --> 02:06:43.092
MARRIES THE LADY
OF HIS CHOICE.

02:06:43.134 --> 02:06:45.719
THE REAL WORLD
IS NOT SO KIND.

02:06:45.761 --> 02:06:49.181
THERE ARE NO
PRIVATE KINGDOMS"

02:06:49.265 --> 02:06:51.350
ONLY PUBLIC ONES.

02:06:53.769 --> 02:06:55.729
I HAVE LOVED BUT ONCE.

02:06:55.771 --> 02:06:58.190
I HAVE LOVED BUT YOU,

02:06:58.274 --> 02:07:00.776
AND I HAVE LOST YOU TWICE.

02:07:15.291 --> 02:07:24.800
I CAN'T FORGET
THE MELODY

02:07:26.051 --> 02:07:35.519
ALTHOUGH OUR SONG
IS THROUGH

02:07:36.854 --> 02:07:42.026
THE LOVE WE SHARED

02:07:42.109 --> 02:07:47.114
THE DREAM WE DARED

02:07:47.156 --> 02:07:52.161
WAS JUST A PRAYER
THAT CAN'T COME TRUE

02:07:58.501 --> 02:08:03.506
I TRY TO STOP
REMEMBERING

02:08:08.844 --> 02:08:18.479
BUT TILL THE DAY I DIE

02:08:18.521 --> 02:08:26.195
WITHIN MY MEMORY

02:08:26.237 --> 02:08:34.620
WILL LIVE THE MELODY

02:08:34.662 --> 02:08:37.581
OF THE SONG

02:08:37.665 --> 02:08:45.214
THAT WAS YOU AND ME

02:08:49.718 --> 02:08:56.475
ALTHOUGH OUR SONG
IS THROUGH

02:08:56.559 --> 02:09:04.692
I CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU

02:09:04.733 --> 02:09:09.738
FOR I CAN'T FORGET
THE MELODY

02:09:26.964 --> 02:09:30.384
AND WHAT, MIGHT I ASK,
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

02:09:30.468 --> 02:09:31.886
OH, IT'S YOU.

02:09:31.969 --> 02:09:33.888
YOU GAVE ME
SUCH A SHOCK.

02:09:33.929 --> 02:09:35.389
I SHOULD HOPE So.

02:09:35.473 --> 02:09:38.434
THAT IS NOTHING TO THE SHOCK
YOU'VE JUST GIVEN ME.

02:09:38.476 --> 02:09:40.936
WHY, YOU SHOULDN'T
BE HERE AT ALL.

02:09:40.978 --> 02:09:42.938
THAT'S NOT
HOW I PLANNED IT.

02:09:42.980 --> 02:09:43.898
OH, REALLY!

02:09:43.939 --> 02:09:46.317
I SOMETIMES WISH
I COULD RETIRE.

02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:47.860
UNLESS I'M
ON THE SPOT

02:09:47.943 --> 02:09:50.362
TO TAKE CARE OF
EVERY LITTLE DETAIL,

02:09:50.446 --> 02:09:51.864
SOMETHING
ALWAYS GOES WRONG.

02:09:51.906 --> 02:09:53.741
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED.

02:09:53.783 --> 02:09:55.242
YOU STAYED BEYOND

02:09:55.284 --> 02:09:57.244
THE STROKE OF
MIDNIGHT, DIDN'T YOU?

02:09:57.286 --> 02:09:59.580
YES. OH, BUT PLEASE
DON'T SCOLD ME.

02:09:59.622 --> 02:10:01.415
I'M UNHAPPY ENOUGH
AS IT IS.

02:10:01.457 --> 02:10:02.917
WELL, OF COURSE,
YOU'RE UNHAPPY.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:03.918
ANY GIRL
WOULD BE UNHAPPY

02:10:03.959 --> 02:10:05.419
IF SHE WERE MISSING
HER OWN WEDDING.

02:10:05.461 --> 02:10:06.420
WEDDING?

02:10:06.462 --> 02:10:07.421
YES.

02:10:07.463 --> 02:10:08.881
THE PRINCE GETS
MARRIED TODAY.

02:10:08.964 --> 02:10:10.633
I HAD THE DATE
UNDERLINED IN MY DIARY.

02:10:10.716 --> 02:10:14.595
WHY ELSE DO YOU SUPPOSE
I AM DRESSED LIKE THIS?

02:10:14.637 --> 02:10:16.430
WHO...

02:10:16.472 --> 02:10:18.224
WHO'S HE MARRYING?

02:10:18.307 --> 02:10:21.227
WELL, AT THE MOMENT, THE
WRONG GIRL, OBVIOUSLY.

02:10:21.310 --> 02:10:22.728
OH, IT'S
TOO IRRITATING.

02:10:22.812 --> 02:10:25.731
I HAD IT
ALL MAPPED OUT.

02:10:25.815 --> 02:10:29.735
WELL, I SUPPOSE I SHALL SIMPLY
HAVE TO RISE TO THE OCCASION

02:10:29.819 --> 02:10:31.695
AND DO SOMETHING
SPECTACULAR YET AGAIN,

02:10:31.779 --> 02:10:34.657
AND SPECTACULARS ALWAYS
TAKE So MUCH OUT OF ME.

02:10:34.698 --> 02:10:36.534
JUST COME DOWN
OFF THE SWING.

02:10:36.617 --> 02:10:39.036
IT WAS THE SAME
WITH SNOW WHITE.

02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:40.538
ALL THE SAME,
YOU YOUNG GIRLS.

02:10:40.663 --> 02:10:42.081
NEVER DO
AS YOU'RE TOLD.

02:10:42.164 --> 02:10:43.582
MEN ARE MUCH EASIER.

02:12:40.282 --> 02:12:43.119
OH, MAMA.

02:13:43.095 --> 02:13:44.764
YOUR MAJESTY.

02:13:44.847 --> 02:13:46.432
SIRE.

02:13:54.315 --> 02:13:55.941
AHEM.

02:13:56.025 --> 02:13:57.443
SIR.

02:14:16.921 --> 02:14:17.880
AHEM !

02:14:17.963 --> 02:14:19.089
OH...

02:14:39.318 --> 02:14:42.029
King: WHAT CAN I SAY?
THIS Is, UH--

02:14:42.071 --> 02:14:43.322
I CAN ASSURE YOU--

02:14:43.405 --> 02:14:46.951
Father of bride: YOUR EXCUSE
IS ABSOLUTELY INADEQUATE.

02:14:49.203 --> 02:14:51.539
AHH.

02:14:51.580 --> 02:14:55.626
IS THE CEREMONY
OVER?

02:14:55.668 --> 02:14:57.837
WHAT A RELIEF!

02:14:57.878 --> 02:15:00.297
YOUR MAJESTY,
THIS COULD LEAD TO WAR.

02:15:00.339 --> 02:15:01.966
I KNOW, I KNOW!
WELL, THINK OF SOMETHING!

02:15:02.049 --> 02:15:03.300
HE CANNOT
MARRY HER, SIRE.

02:15:03.342 --> 02:15:04.802
THE CONSTITUTION
DOES NOT ALLOW IT.

02:15:04.885 --> 02:15:06.637
WELL, DON'T TELL ME.
I WROTE IT.

02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:09.014
YES. DON'T TELL HIM.
HE WROTE IT.

02:15:09.056 --> 02:15:10.766
I BEG YOUR
PARDOH, MADAM?

02:15:10.850 --> 02:15:13.269
AND IF HE WROTE IT,
HE CAN UNWRITE IT.

02:15:13.352 --> 02:15:14.812
DON'T YOU AGREE,
YOUR MAJESTY?

02:15:14.895 --> 02:15:16.397
HE CAN WRITE
WHAT HE LIKES,

02:15:16.439 --> 02:15:18.357
So LONG AS
HE CLEARS THIS ROOM.

02:15:18.441 --> 02:15:21.819
THERE ARE TOO MANY
PEOPLE IN IT BY FAR,

02:15:21.902 --> 02:15:24.822
MOST OF THEM
NOT WORTH A CANDLE.

02:15:24.905 --> 02:15:26.365
AFTER ALL,
YOU ARE THE KING.

02:15:26.407 --> 02:15:27.950
YES, THAT'S RIGHT. I AM!

02:15:28.033 --> 02:15:29.994
AND ABSOLUTE MONARCHS
SHOULD ACT ABSOLUTELY.

02:15:30.077 --> 02:15:31.495
IT'S VERY BECOMING.

02:15:31.579 --> 02:15:32.955
SHE'S RIGHT
WHO IS SHE?

02:15:33.038 --> 02:15:33.998
I'VE NO IDEA, SIRE.

02:15:34.081 --> 02:15:36.000
SHE MUST BE
ONE OF THE VISITORS.

02:15:36.083 --> 02:15:38.502
BUT EVEN IF YOU ALTER THE
CONSTITUTIOH, YOUR MAJESTY,

02:15:38.586 --> 02:15:41.005
IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM
OF THE OTHER BRIDE.

02:15:41.088 --> 02:15:42.840
No, YOU'RE RIGHT. SO WE'RE
BACK WHERE WE STARTED.

02:15:42.882 --> 02:15:44.175
IT'S STARING YOU
IN THE FACE.

02:15:44.258 --> 02:15:45.134
WHAT IS?

02:15:45.176 --> 02:15:46.802
THE ANSWER.

02:15:46.844 --> 02:15:48.804
King: WHAT SORT OF
AN ANSWER IS THAT?

02:15:48.846 --> 02:15:50.139
Fairy Godmother:
THEY'RE IN LOVE!

02:15:50.222 --> 02:15:51.182
THEY ARE?

02:15:51.223 --> 02:15:52.767
IT WAS LOVE AT
FIRST SIGHT.

02:15:52.850 --> 02:15:54.310
