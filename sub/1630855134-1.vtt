any of this matters.

divestment's

18:44.364 --> 18:45.759
gonna solve everything,

18:45.794 --> 18:47.728
but it is a big step
in the right direction.

18:47.763 --> 18:50.335
-Which would be great
if we still had time,

18:50.370 --> 18:53.371

any market solution does shit,

18:53.406 --> 18:55.307
billions of people will be dead
from climate disaster.

18:55.342 --> 18:56.869
[Orin]
We all want faster change,

18:56.904 --> 18:59.608
but these are huge systems
that change incrementally.

18:59.643 --> 19:01.610
-Right, so act
outside of the system.

19:01.645 --> 19:04.316
We need to start attacking
the things that are killing us.

19:04.351 --> 19:06.648
We can take more drastic action.

19:06.683 --> 19:07.616
-Like what?

19:09.653 --> 19:12.753
-Like... actual sabotage.

19:14.658 --> 19:16.328
Property destruction.

19:19.663 --> 19:21.465
[Shawn] Mom, I've been trying.

19:23.601 --> 19:26.404
I know, it's just been
a difficult semester.

19:26.439 --> 19:28.439
It's just a lot, you know?

19:30.740 --> 19:33.675
But the new computer is
definitely helping.

19:39.386 --> 19:40.715
Yeah, you know what,

19:40.750 --> 19:43.520
I have to, uh...
I actually have to go study.

19:44.688 --> 19:46.292
I love you, too. Bye.

19:50.364 --> 19:51.792
[phone ringing]

19:53.059 --> 19:53.959
[Xochitl]<i> [over phone]</i>
<i>Hello?</i>

19:53.994 --> 19:55.499
[Shawn] Hey, Xochitl?

19:55.534 --> 19:56.731
[Xochitl]<i> [over phone]</i>
Who is this?

19:56.766 --> 19:59.305
[Shawn] Yeah, it's Shawn
from Divest.

20:02.574 --> 20:04.277
A refinery? No.

20:04.312 --> 20:05.806
-Why?
-[Shawn] What do you mean why?

20:05.841 --> 20:07.874
It's way too big. We could
end up killing somebody

20:07.909 --> 20:10.415
or causing an ecological
disaster.

20:10.450 --> 20:11.482
-Sabotage is messy.

20:12.914 --> 20:14.716
[Shawn] Yeah, but we can't
give the public

20:14.751 --> 20:16.520
a reason to invalidate us.

20:16.555 --> 20:20.293
What about destroying
like a coal truck route

20:20.328 --> 20:21.723
or damaging roads?
-[Xochitl] That's lame.

20:21.758 --> 20:23.428
We have to do something
that would scare people.

20:23.463 --> 20:25.694
-What, do you wanna
like kidnap an oil exec

20:25.729 --> 20:27.894
or blow up a private jet, what?

20:27.929 --> 20:31.403
-We have to show how vulnerable
the oil industry is

20:31.438 --> 20:33.867
by hitting something big,
like a refinery.

20:39.710 --> 20:41.710
-What about Texas?

20:41.745 --> 20:44.713
That's where they set
oil price benchmarks.

20:44.748 --> 20:47.320
If we cut off their supply
or destroyed something

20:47.355 --> 20:49.619
even relatively small,
it would really disrupt shit.

20:52.459 --> 20:54.459
-What do you know about Texas?

20:54.494 --> 20:56.428
-I mean, what do you know
about building a bomb?

21:07.540 --> 21:09.771
[Alisha] 50-50's awful.
Don't be so negative.

21:09.806 --> 21:11.377
[Theo] Those are good odds.

21:11.412 --> 21:13.346
You can't get
better odds in Vegas.

21:13.381 --> 21:15.348
-Odds for what?

21:15.383 --> 21:16.514
-That we blow ourselves up.

21:18.452 --> 21:20.518
-Oh, you know, Che figured
that nearly half the guys

21:20.553 --> 21:22.619
he sent to build bombs
blew themselves up,

21:22.654 --> 21:23.884
so I'd say like 50-50.

21:23.919 --> 21:25.523
-See? Told you.

21:25.558 --> 21:26.557
-Okay, don't get too happy.

21:27.659 --> 21:29.824
-Check this out. Here.

21:29.859 --> 21:30.759
Star, one-two-three.

21:33.764 --> 21:35.467
[computerized voice]
<i>One-two-three.</i>

21:35.502 --> 21:36.699
-[loud crack]
-[Alisha] Ooh!

21:36.734 --> 21:37.799
-[Theo] Wow.
-[Alisha] Nice work.

21:37.834 --> 21:38.767
-Thank you.

21:40.837 --> 21:43.442
[Michael] You ready to pack
the blasting caps?

21:43.477 --> 21:44.069
[Shawn] Just about.

21:45.644 --> 21:46.544
-Michael, what do you think
the odds are

21:46.579 --> 21:47.677
we blow ourselves up?

21:49.912 --> 21:51.010
-I don't really care.

21:51.815 --> 21:53.386
[Theo] Okay.

21:53.421 --> 21:55.421
-I was telling them
about how Che thought

21:55.456 --> 21:57.423
that half the guys
he sent to build bombs

21:57.458 --> 21:58.556
blew themselves up, so...

21:59.790 --> 22:00.690
-Can we go?

22:04.960 --> 22:07.862
-[Alisha] Strange kid.
-He's no fun. [laughs]

22:07.897 --> 22:11.866
-Listen, if I touch
or even jostle

22:11.901 --> 22:15.738
this primer too much,
it could detonate.

22:15.773 --> 22:18.840
I need you to take this,
stand 20 yards back.

22:20.613 --> 22:21.876
If anything goes wrong...

22:24.980 --> 22:26.782
then don't come
unless I tell you to,

22:26.817 --> 22:27.717
unless you see fire.

22:29.985 --> 22:31.787
-Don't come in. Got it.

22:37.729 --> 22:40.961
-[Michael breathing heavily]

23:11.895 --> 23:13.829
[breathing heavily]

23:13.864 --> 23:14.896
Stop it.

23:17.098 --> 23:20.033
[dramatic music]

23:39.923 --> 23:40.988
[exhales] Come on.

23:42.530 --> 23:44.959
[breathing heavily]

24:00.647 --> 24:03.549
[suspenseful music]

24:39.851 --> 24:40.916
One down!

25:00.036 --> 25:01.002
[explosion]

25:11.652 --> 25:13.916
[truck approaching]

25:24.192 --> 25:25.763
[oil worker] I thought they
told you at the front office

25:25.798 --> 25:26.797
you can't come around here
anymore.

25:26.832 --> 25:27.897
Go home.

25:27.932 --> 25:30.999
-Hey, can I ask you a question?

25:31.034 --> 25:32.099
[oil worker] What?

25:33.168 --> 25:34.772
-This is you here?

25:34.807 --> 25:35.872
[oil worker] Yes.

25:35.907 --> 25:37.874
-1711?
-[oil worker] Yes.

25:37.909 --> 25:38.842
-You stay warm?

25:40.142 --> 25:41.878
-Yes, I stay warm in there. Yes.

25:41.913 --> 25:42.912
-Where you from?

25:44.949 --> 25:45.915
I asked you where you're from.

25:45.950 --> 25:47.180
It's a simple question.

25:47.215 --> 25:48.621
-South Carolina.

25:50.691 --> 25:51.921
-That's a nice coat.
-Don't fuckin' touch me.

25:53.056 --> 25:54.627
Don't touch my jacket.

25:54.662 --> 25:55.628
-It's a nice coat, man.

25:55.663 --> 25:57.058
-Do not fuckin' touch me.

25:57.093 --> 25:58.059
-Can I have it?

25:59.898 --> 26:00.930
Why don't you go back
to where you came from?

26:00.965 --> 26:02.162
-What?

26:02.197 --> 26:04.901
Motherfucker.
-Don't fuckin' grab me.

26:04.936 --> 26:06.771
Eat fuckin' shit, fucker.

26:06.806 --> 26:08.674
Fuck! Motherfucker.

26:13.714 --> 26:16.748
[wind blowing]

26:22.954 --> 26:26.054
[powerful music]

26:53.886 --> 26:56.854
[seeds rattling]

26:56.889 --> 26:58.251
[Joanna] Four.

26:58.286 --> 26:59.824
[seeds rattling]

26:59.859 --> 27:00.858
Five.

27:00.893 --> 27:01.826
[door opens and closes]

27:03.126 --> 27:04.961
Oh, how was your day?

27:15.006 --> 27:17.237
[sighs] You can't
keep doing this.

27:19.043 --> 27:20.812
You're going to get yourself
killed.

27:22.013 --> 27:23.980
-Yeah.

27:24.015 --> 27:26.752
[Joanna] Michael, there's
so much real work to do.

27:28.921 --> 27:31.152
Why won't you help at
the conservancy with me?

27:32.859 --> 27:34.056
-You didn't even ask me
what I did.

27:37.831 --> 27:39.732
-I'm tired of lying
to the police.

27:39.767 --> 27:41.261
-Can you stop?

27:41.296 --> 27:43.230
Didn't you used to try?

27:44.871 --> 27:47.498
Now you're just a coward,
like everybody else.

27:47.533 --> 27:48.939
-I am not a coward.

27:48.974 --> 27:51.744
-You want me to sit here
and count seeds?

27:51.779 --> 27:53.141
You want me to lie down
and let them win?

27:53.176 --> 27:55.077
[Joanna] How are you winning?

27:55.112 --> 27:58.014
Picking fights with men
who only come here for work.

27:59.314 --> 28:01.754
-You're right.
I'm a fuckin' idiot.

28:01.789 --> 28:02.953
-[Joanna] Our conservancy--
-I don't care

28:02.988 --> 28:04.251
about the conservancy, okay?

28:05.826 --> 28:08.024
I don't care,
it doesn't do anything.

28:08.059 --> 28:09.828
What does it do? It makes
white people feel better.

28:09.863 --> 28:12.325
It makes you feel better.
And it does nothing!

28:15.968 --> 28:17.198
-So what did you guys
fight about?

28:17.233 --> 28:19.365
[Michael] I mean,
you know how she is.

28:19.400 --> 28:20.938
Just needed to get out.

28:22.007 --> 28:24.073
-Here. Take it.

28:25.340 --> 28:27.912
Look, you can stay
in the garage.

28:27.947 --> 28:29.342
Just pull like
three shifts a week.

28:30.983 --> 28:31.443
There's nothin' to it.

28:33.117 --> 28:35.755
Come on, I'll run you
through the registers.

28:37.924 --> 28:41.761
-Is there an...
employee discount here?

28:43.424 --> 28:47.294
[into phone] Hey, everyone,
welcome back to "Boom Tok".

28:47.329 --> 28:50.231
Today is day 19.

28:50.266 --> 28:52.838
Teaching myself to make
a homemade blasting cap

28:52.873 --> 28:54.103
for under $50 in materials.

28:54.138 --> 28:56.908
Today we're making nitric acid

28:58.307 --> 29:00.945
out of stump remover
and drain cleaner.

29:10.858 --> 29:11.791
Shit!

29:13.454 --> 29:16.422
Hey, everyone.
[breathing heavily]

29:16.457 --> 29:23.033
Today I am test dumping the
charge of a nine-volt battery

29:23.068 --> 29:26.201
to a blasting cap
full of lead azide.

29:26.236 --> 29:29.369
And if this works,
then it'll be step one

29:29.404 --> 29:31.811
in making our own
improvised explosive.

29:41.086 --> 29:43.185
[phone ringing]

29:51.998 --> 29:53.393
-[Rowan gasps]
-[Logan] Shit.

29:53.428 --> 29:54.328
[Rowan] Oh my God.

29:55.903 --> 29:57.199
[Shawn] Michael!

29:57.234 --> 29:58.035
-[Xochitl] Michael!
-[Dwayne] Oh shit.

29:58.070 --> 29:59.564
[Xochitl] Oh!

29:59.599 --> 30:01.269
-[Shawn] Michael, you okay?
-[Michael] Stay back.

30:01.304 --> 30:03.238
-[Xochitl] What happened?
-[Michael] Stay back.

30:03.273 --> 30:04.272
[Michael] Fuck.

30:04.307 --> 30:05.273
[Dwayne] What the hell happened?

30:05.308 --> 30:07.143
[plastic sheet rustling]

30:07.178 --> 30:09.013
[Michael groans]

30:09.048 --> 30:09.948
[Dwayne] Hey, can you breathe?

30:09.983 --> 30:11.213
[Michael groans]

30:11.248 --> 30:12.049
-Can you breathe?
-[Michael] Yeah.

30:12.084 --> 30:13.413
[Xochitl] Fuck!

30:13.448 --> 30:15.118
-[Shawn] Hey, hey!
-[Michael] Stop, stop!

30:15.153 --> 30:18.583
-[Shawn] Stay, stay. No.
-[Michael] I'm fine. I'm sorry.

30:18.618 --> 30:20.123
Just keep back.

30:20.158 --> 30:21.289
-[Shawn] Jesus.
-[Michael] Step back.

30:21.324 --> 30:23.060
Just let me finish this.

30:23.095 --> 30:24.094
[Xochitl] Fuck.

30:24.129 --> 30:28.230
-[grunts]

30:33.336 --> 30:35.303
-Watch him.
-Yeah.

30:36.537 --> 30:39.241
[panting]

30:40.981 --> 30:43.113
[creaking]

30:45.986 --> 30:47.216
-[Logan] Whoa!
-[laughs]

30:47.251 --> 30:48.679
[Logan] You tryin' to
blow us up?

30:48.714 --> 30:51.187
Jesus Christ, Theo.
-[Xochitl] Come on, Theo,

30:51.222 --> 30:53.519
let's roll.
-Let's roll? Get it?

30:53.554 --> 30:56.093
-Got some fresh deer meat,
if y'all are interested.

30:57.195 --> 30:58.326
-I'm vegan.

30:58.361 --> 30:59.932
-I'm vegetarian.

31:01.001 --> 31:02.000
[Theo grunts]

31:02.035 --> 31:04.068
-Yo, is Michael okay?

31:04.103 --> 31:05.267
-Yeah, I hope so.

31:07.073 --> 31:08.039
Oh God.

31:09.438 --> 31:11.108
-I'm gonna go pee.

31:11.143 --> 31:12.109
-Pee on me.

31:17.512 --> 31:20.216
[Theo] Is it me or is this
getting heavier?

31:20.251 --> 31:23.516
[Xochitl] Yeah, it's soaking up
moisture. [laughs]

31:24.585 --> 31:27.927
[dramatic music]

31:40.370 --> 31:42.106
Fuck.

31:42.141 --> 31:45.439
[dramatic music]

31:45.474 --> 31:46.506
-[Theo] You're doin' good.
-[Xochitl] Do it one-handed.

31:46.541 --> 31:49.080
Yep.
-[Theo] Good.

31:49.115 --> 31:52.050
Wanna do the three thing again?

31:52.085 --> 31:53.315
[Xochitl] I feel like
that makes it go slower.

31:53.350 --> 31:54.250
-[Theo] Did it?
-[Xochitl] Yeah.

31:54.285 --> 31:55.383
[Theo] Oh shit, okay.

31:55.418 --> 31:57.253
[Xochitl]
If you just one-hand it.

31:57.288 --> 31:58.991
You doin' okay? You done?

32:05.098 --> 32:07.032
[Logan] That looks medium rare,
it's pink in the middle.

32:08.299 --> 32:10.167
[fire crackles]

32:10.202 --> 32:11.564
[Michael] Three caps. Done.

32:11.599 --> 32:13.269
-[Logan] Woo!
-[Rowan] Woo!

32:13.304 --> 32:14.270
-[Xochitl] Michael.
-[Shawn] Nice job, Michael.

32:14.305 --> 32:15.568
[Dwayne] Proud of you.

32:15.603 --> 32:16.602
Why don't you grab a plate?

32:16.637 --> 32:18.241
[Shawn] The food is so good.

32:18.276 --> 32:20.045
[Logan] A little overcooked,
but it's great.

32:22.544 --> 32:23.477
It is.

32:29.584 --> 32:31.023
-Theo, what's with the alcohol?

32:31.058 --> 32:32.717
I thought we were
gonna keep a clear head.

32:32.752 --> 32:34.323
-Don't worry about me.

32:34.358 --> 32:37.161
My chemical childhood
gave me superpowers.

32:37.196 --> 32:39.031
[Logan]
I like the way you talk, Theo.

32:39.066 --> 32:41.000
Pass that, please.

32:46.568 --> 32:49.173
Mm! Mother's milk.

32:50.671 --> 32:51.769
-I have a blunt.

32:51.804 --> 32:53.276
-You have a blunt?
-Yeah.

32:53.311 --> 32:55.509
-I've got some handles
in the back if

32:55.544 --> 32:57.082
anyone has mixers.

32:59.383 --> 33:00.283
[all laugh loudly]

33:00.318 --> 33:02.153
-Answer the question.

33:02.188 --> 33:03.550
Do you feel like a terrorist?
-Do I feel like a terrorist?

33:03.585 --> 33:05.387
Of course I feel like
a fucking terrorist.

33:05.422 --> 33:07.455
We're blowing up
a goddamn pipeline.

33:07.490 --> 33:09.061
They're gonna
call us terrorists.

33:09.096 --> 33:10.227
-No, they're gonna
call us revolutionaries

33:10.262 --> 33:11.525
or game changers.

33:11.560 --> 33:13.428
-No, they're gonna
call us terrorists

33:13.463 --> 33:14.495
'case we're doing terrorism.

33:14.530 --> 33:16.629
-Who cares what they call us?

33:16.664 --> 33:18.334
-We ain't hurtin' nobody.

33:18.369 --> 33:20.336
-Boston Tea Party, they were
terrorists of their day.

33:20.371 --> 33:21.733
They didn't hurt anybody.

33:21.768 --> 33:23.207
-Patriots.

33:23.242 --> 33:24.472
[Shawn] MLK was called
a terrorist.

33:24.507 --> 33:26.144
He was on the FBI watch list.

33:26.179 --> 33:26.837
[Rowan] Why? He was like nice.

33:26.872 --> 33:28.509
-No, no, no, no, no.

33:28.544 --> 33:30.610
He was freakin' ruthless.
-[Alisha] I'm sorry.

33:30.645 --> 33:32.711
You're trying to equate
Civil Rights Movement

33:32.746 --> 33:34.482
to what we're doing here?

33:34.517 --> 33:36.550
-I mean, it's kinda similar.
-[Xochitl] Look, anytime anyone

33:36.585 --> 33:39.553
has challenged authority,
they call it terrorism.

33:39.588 --> 33:42.391
And then when
the terrorism works,

33:42.426 --> 33:44.294
they lie about the legacy
and they say

33:44.329 --> 33:46.725
that it was all passive,
nonviolent, kumbaya shit

33:46.760 --> 33:47.759
when it's not!

33:47.794 --> 33:49.497
[Michael] If the American Empire

33:49.532 --> 33:51.235
calls us terrorists, then
we're doing something right.

33:51.270 --> 33:53.534
-Fuck yeah.
What he said, exactly.

33:53.569 --> 33:55.371
People talk shit about me
my whole entire life.

33:55.406 --> 33:57.109
I don't give a shit.
-Jesus was a terrorist!

33:57.144 --> 33:58.737
-[all laugh]
-[Xochitl] What?

33:58.772 --> 34:00.310
-[Shawn] He was a terrorist!
-What are you talking about?

34:00.345 --> 34:01.674
[Shawn] You cannot tell me
otherwise.

34:01.709 --> 34:03.478
-[Alisha] In what lifetime?
-[Theo] Aw!

34:03.513 --> 34:04.644
-Okay, considered in his time.
-[Logan] Oh no, Dwayne!

34:04.679 --> 34:06.250
-He's a martyr now.

34:06.285 --> 34:07.218
We're sorry, Dwayne.
-[Alisha] Wait, okay.

34:07.253 --> 34:08.516
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:08.551 --> 34:10.221
No, but for real,
we should acknowledge

34:10.256 --> 34:11.354
that what we're doing
is actually

34:11.389 --> 34:12.652
gonna hurt a lotta people.

34:12.687 --> 34:13.884
[Rowan]
It's not gonna hurt anyone.

34:13.919 --> 34:14.885
We're not hurting anyone.

34:14.920 --> 34:16.359
-We're spiking oil prices.

34:16.394 --> 34:18.328
-Revolution has
collateral damage.

34:18.363 --> 34:19.725
-Yeah, but who's
the collateral?

34:19.760 --> 34:21.364
You wanna burn it down
in an hour?

34:21.399 --> 34:23.267
It takes like a lifetime
to build something new.

34:25.502 --> 34:26.699
-I'm not tryin' to
rebuild anything.

34:34.181 --> 34:35.444
-[exhales]

34:51.429 --> 34:53.297
[exhales]

34:53.332 --> 34:56.531
[suspenseful music]

34:58.667 --> 35:00.238
[rustling]

35:07.379 --> 35:10.545
[clicks on mobile phone]

35:25.397 --> 35:27.232
[Theo] Everything's spinning.

35:29.632 --> 35:30.532
[Alisha] It'll pass.

35:32.503 --> 35:34.437
[Theo] It never does.

35:34.472 --> 35:35.471
[Velcro snapping]

35:39.477 --> 35:40.542
Are you scared?

35:43.514 --> 35:46.647
-Uh, yeah.

35:48.321 --> 35:49.320
Are you?

35:50.818 --> 35:51.784
-No.

35:57.330 --> 35:59.264
I love you so much.

36:00.696 --> 36:01.728
-I love you, too.

36:12.345 --> 36:13.542
Come on, go to sleep.

36:16.712 --> 36:20.483
[Theo sighs]

36:23.587 --> 36:26.852
[suspenseful music]

36:26.887 --> 36:28.821
-Thanks for keeping
your cool tonight, man.

36:37.304 --> 36:38.402
You know, I'm worried
about the others.

36:39.702 --> 36:40.833
If we can't keep them focused--

36:40.868 --> 36:41.801
-Goodnight, Michael.

36:46.808 --> 36:49.578
[rustling]

36:51.813 --> 36:52.746
[sighs]

36:55.322 --> 36:57.322
[tense music]

37:01.691 --> 37:04.461
[hammering]

37:21.348 --> 37:22.479
[Surveyor] Whoa! Whoa, whoa!

37:26.617 --> 37:29.420
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

37:29.455 --> 37:31.323
This isn't your land!
-[cocks gun]

37:31.358 --> 37:32.885
[Surveyor] You can't
block the road!

37:32.920 --> 37:34.755
[single gunshot]

37:34.790 --> 37:35.855
Are you crazy?

37:35.890 --> 37:37.362
[Dwayne] You're on my property!

37:39.696 --> 37:40.629
Go home!

37:50.135 --> 37:51.739
[Geoff] Whatever that thing is.

37:51.774 --> 37:53.576
Yeah, just put it, like,
right in front of them,

37:53.611 --> 37:54.808
kinda cocked a little
towards me.

37:54.843 --> 37:56.381
Yeah, yeah, yeah, like that.

37:56.416 --> 37:59.615
-[Shawn] That good?
-Yeah, there we go.

37:59.650 --> 38:01.716
Much better. Yeah,
it feels more lived in.

38:03.654 --> 38:05.489
Okay, let's roll.

38:07.053 --> 38:08.789
-Sound speed.

38:08.824 --> 38:14.531
-Okay, so... [sighs],
I guess, um... [clears throat]

38:16.436 --> 38:19.338
in your own words,
tell us what happened.

38:20.605 --> 38:21.802
-Um...

38:23.806 --> 38:26.642
Tried to stop a pipeline
from being built on my property.

38:29.680 --> 38:33.583
Poisons the air, water,

38:33.618 --> 38:35.948
ruins crops, kills cattle.

38:37.952 --> 38:39.556
We had a baby on the way,

38:39.591 --> 38:42.922
so I tried to fight 'em in court

38:42.957 --> 38:44.693
and they kept using the, um,

38:46.158 --> 38:47.795
they kept using the--
-Imminent domain.

38:47.830 --> 38:49.863
-Imminent domain...
-[Geoff] Imminent domain.

38:49.898 --> 38:50.897
-...domain excuse.

38:50.932 --> 38:52.404
[Geoff] Government seizure

38:52.439 --> 38:54.439
of private property
for public use.

38:54.474 --> 38:56.408
[Dwayne] Yeah, sure.

38:56.443 --> 38:57.167
That property
had been in my family

38:57.202 --> 38:58.872
for over a hundred years.

38:58.907 --> 39:01.545
I wasn't gonna let anybody
take it from me, so...

39:02.911 --> 39:06.913
-Okay, so, take me back to
that moment,

39:06.948 --> 39:09.454
being forced to leave.

39:09.489 --> 39:10.851
That powerlessness.

39:12.591 --> 39:14.954
-Uh, I don't--I don't know
if I wanna go there.

39:16.727 --> 39:17.891
[Geoff] Well, it's important.

39:17.926 --> 39:19.761
-For what?

39:19.796 --> 39:22.731
-We're trying to put
a human face on this crisis.

39:22.766 --> 39:23.864
It helps.

39:25.934 --> 39:27.967
-I mean, this is our lives.

39:29.036 --> 39:30.838
We lost our home.

39:30.873 --> 39:32.444
We had to move in with my mom.

39:32.479 --> 39:34.446
We got thousands in legal bills.

39:34.481 --> 39:35.612
Are y'all gonna help with that?

39:37.077 --> 39:38.615
-Oh, I wish we could,

39:40.047 --> 39:44.687
but we--we're an organization
telling stories,

39:44.722 --> 39:46.557
raising awareness. It--
-[Dwayne] You wanna help?

39:48.627 --> 39:49.923
Why don't you go out
and get me a new .45.

39:49.958 --> 39:50.990
I got some names for you.

39:51.025 --> 39:52.728
[Katie] [gently] Dwayne.

39:52.763 --> 39:53.762
-Excuse me?

39:55.029 --> 39:56.534
-Let's wrap this shit up.

40:01.640 --> 40:02.705
So fuckin' annoying.

40:03.873 --> 40:05.444
Yeah, I'm sorry.

40:07.107 --> 40:08.040
What?

40:09.582 --> 40:10.647
Come here. Come on.

40:12.112 --> 40:14.816
I'm sorry.
-[Katie crying]

40:14.851 --> 40:16.081
-It's gonna be okay, all right?

40:16.116 --> 40:17.918
-[Katie] I'm so tired.
-I know.

40:20.989 --> 40:22.461
Oh, goddamn it.

40:23.992 --> 40:25.563
Did you forget to test
your blood sugar?

40:25.598 --> 40:26.894
-Oh, my gosh.

40:26.929 --> 40:29.567
-You got it?
-[Katie] Yeah. [sniffles]

40:32.572 --> 40:33.505
[Shawn] Hello?

40:38.545 --> 40:39.137
Hey.

40:40.679 --> 40:42.679
-[Dwayne] You forget somethin'?
-Who is it?

40:42.714 --> 40:44.043
-It's the guy from the movie.
-[Shawn] No, no, I just...

40:44.078 --> 40:46.045
-Tell him to screw off.

40:46.080 --> 40:48.817
-No, I'm--I'm sorry
about earlier.

40:48.852 --> 40:51.050
I just, I--I came alone.

40:55.562 --> 40:59.861
Listen, um...
the movie sucks.

40:59.896 --> 41:00.829
[Dwayne scoffs]

41:02.965 --> 41:04.767
-The only reason
that I decided to join

41:04.802 --> 41:06.098
was so I could meet
people like you.

41:08.135 --> 41:09.574
-What do you mean,
people like me?

41:10.940 --> 41:14.513
-You know,
people who live out here...

41:15.780 --> 41:16.944
people who know the land...

41:18.882 --> 41:20.849
people who wanna fight.

41:20.884 --> 41:23.819
[thrilling music]

41:33.831 --> 41:34.764
[Dwayne] I think
there's a way to do it

41:34.799 --> 41:36.568
without spillin' any oil.

41:36.603 --> 41:38.097
Right here.
-[baby crying]

41:38.132 --> 41:41.001
-Use this valve station
to shut off the oil flow.

41:41.036 --> 41:43.300
Inside the fence,
we gotta turn this wheel,

41:43.335 --> 41:44.675
and just down the road

41:44.710 --> 41:45.841
from there--
-I'm gonna put her down.

41:45.876 --> 41:46.842
-Okay.

41:48.945 --> 41:50.879
And then the first site's
about a mile away from there.

41:50.914 --> 41:52.848
Right here,
underground pipe,

41:52.883 --> 41:54.817
top of the hill.

41:54.852 --> 41:57.853
And we could blow the pipe
at the hilltop,

41:57.888 --> 41:59.184
and the oil will stay in.

41:59.219 --> 42:01.725
-You think it's got enough
altitude?

42:01.760 --> 42:03.826
-Yeah, I've done
the readings myself.

42:03.861 --> 42:06.730
[dramatic music]

42:08.195 --> 42:10.063
Now, the second bomb site's
about two miles

42:10.098 --> 42:11.163
down the road from there.

42:12.837 --> 42:14.166
Hundred and fifty feet
of elevated pipe.

42:20.042 --> 42:22.042
That's lucky for us 'cause
most of the pipe is underground,

42:22.077 --> 42:24.143
but on site,
there's an old coal mine,

42:24.178 --> 42:26.079
so they had to pop it up.

42:26.114 --> 42:28.147
Now, if we blow the pipe
in the middle,

42:28.182 --> 42:30.820
then, slope on either side will

42:30.855 --> 42:33.658
keep the oil from leakin'.

42:33.693 --> 42:36.760
Yeah, I scouted this
for five weeks

42:36.795 --> 42:39.862
and there's no way we would find
all three anywhere else.

42:39.897 --> 42:42.766
-[clears throat]
Mom's back in 45.

42:42.801 --> 42:45.703
Can I get y'all a beer
or somethin'?

42:45.738 --> 42:46.869
-Oh yeah, thank you.

42:46.904 --> 42:48.805
-Just water for me, please.

42:48.840 --> 42:50.906
-Oh, we're outta water.

42:50.941 --> 42:52.743
-Then, beer is great, thanks.

42:53.240 --> 42:54.811
So...

42:54.846 --> 42:56.109
when we plant the bomb
and clear the area,

42:56.144 --> 42:57.979
we have to make sure
that two people

42:58.014 --> 43:01.048
are at the valve station to
shut off the active oil flow.

43:01.083 --> 43:02.819
That way, we can detonate it.

43:02.854 --> 43:05.657
-And what are these bombs
made of?

43:05.692 --> 43:06.790
[Shawn] Somethin' like
the equivalent

43:06.825 --> 43:08.726
of 600 sticks of dynamite?

43:10.092 --> 43:12.796
[Katie] What if y'all do
structural damage?

43:12.831 --> 43:15.799
-Structural damage
is kinda the point.

43:15.834 --> 43:17.834
They'll spin anything smaller
as an accident,

43:17.869 --> 43:19.671
so two bombs.

43:19.706 --> 43:23.840
-Right, we have to make oil
unviable in the marketplace.

43:23.875 --> 43:26.106
The shock of our explosion
will make it so the JDIA

43:26.141 --> 43:28.812
has to reinspect miles of pipe.

43:28.847 --> 43:31.716
If they can't move oil,
they can't sell it.

43:31.751 --> 43:33.784
-What? We ain't gonna spill
more oil than what leaks

43:33.819 --> 43:35.082
on normal business hours.

43:35.117 --> 43:36.985
-Right, but Dwayne,
we live here.

43:37.020 --> 43:39.691
-Katie, we talked about this,
okay?

43:39.726 --> 43:41.825
It's gonna be fine,
I'll take care of it.

43:41.860 --> 43:42.661
Okay?

43:43.994 --> 43:46.192
-Yeah... this is gonna
fucking work.

43:48.097 --> 43:51.032
[alarm ringing]

43:51.067 --> 43:52.132
[Logan] Oh, God.

43:54.873 --> 43:55.938
[clattering]

43:57.843 --> 43:58.369
-Here's some breakfast.

44:00.010 --> 44:01.273
-Any coffee?
-There's some instant coffee.

44:01.308 --> 44:02.978
It's out on the genny.

44:03.013 --> 44:05.079
-Up, now. Come on.
-[Logan] God!

44:06.753 --> 44:07.686
I'm dying.

44:09.822 --> 44:11.250
[Shawn] Hey, how much time?

44:11.285 --> 44:13.120
[Xochitl] About 20 minutes.

44:19.766 --> 44:21.161
-How are you feeling?

44:21.196 --> 44:22.162
-Good.

44:24.298 --> 44:25.297
You?

44:26.366 --> 44:27.299
-Good.

44:28.841 --> 44:29.774
-Good.

44:43.856 --> 44:44.789
[Logan coughing]

44:50.797 --> 44:52.159
-Your turn.

44:52.194 --> 44:54.194
-Fuck, I'm gonna
fucking die right now.

44:54.229 --> 44:56.295
-Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you say that every morning.

44:57.870 --> 45:00.167
-Fuck you.
-And you never do.

45:00.202 --> 45:01.069
[Michael] All right...

45:02.171 --> 45:03.170
last chance.

45:05.339 --> 45:06.239
Anybody want out?

[rumble of heavy machinery]

57:12.934 --> 57:14.032
Nice haircut.
-[chuckles]

57:15.673 --> 57:16.606
-Thank you.

57:21.547 --> 57:22.810
I saw the GoFundMe.

57:23.945 --> 57:25.615
How you feeling?

57:25.650 --> 57:27.848
-You know,
makin' peace with the Lord.

57:29.984 --> 57:31.720
[Xochitl] You didn't call.

57:31.755 --> 57:33.018
-You don't always pick up.

57:34.626 --> 57:36.054
-Fair enough.

57:36.089 --> 57:38.056
-Just fucking with you.

57:38.091 --> 57:39.530
It's fine. You were busy.

57:40.632 --> 57:42.698
-Not anymore. Dropped out.

57:44.702 --> 57:45.701
-You dropped out?

57:46.869 --> 57:48.033
Why?

57:48.068 --> 57:49.672
-'Cause fuck that.

57:49.707 --> 57:52.939
-Xochitl... that sucks.

57:54.976 --> 57:55.942
You left, you--

57:55.977 --> 57:57.581
-No. Theo, listen.

57:57.616 --> 57:59.616
You have your phone on you?

57:59.651 --> 58:00.584
-Yeah.

58:01.983 --> 58:02.982
-Turn it off.

58:05.954 --> 58:06.920
[Alisha] There you go.

58:07.989 --> 58:09.186
Enjoy.

58:09.221 --> 58:10.825
[Natalie] Hey, y'all.

58:10.860 --> 58:13.058
Just so you know, we are
really low on supplies,

58:13.093 --> 58:16.094
so we're not gonna be serving
for the rest of the week.

58:16.129 --> 58:17.799
We're all really, really sorry.

58:23.906 --> 58:25.037
-[Theo] Hey.
-Oh!

58:25.072 --> 58:26.808
You're up and about.

58:26.843 --> 58:28.843
[Theo] Yeah, I wanted
to come by and help.

58:28.878 --> 58:30.009
-You sure you're okay?

58:31.144 --> 58:32.748
Xochitl said what?

58:32.783 --> 58:34.981
Can't believe she even asked.

58:35.016 --> 58:37.181
Well, what did you say?

58:37.216 --> 58:38.952
-It's a dope idea.

58:38.987 --> 58:40.789
-No, it's crazy.

58:40.824 --> 58:42.593
-I don't know,
fixing shit in a system

58:42.628 --> 58:44.122
built by oppressors
is kinda crazy.

58:44.157 --> 58:46.729
-Oh my God,
you sound just like her.

58:46.764 --> 58:49.765
Theo, Xochitl's just another
girl that went to college,

58:49.800 --> 58:51.767
read a book, and decided
she knows how to save the world.

58:51.802 --> 58:53.131
[Theo] That's so unfair.

58:53.166 --> 58:54.165
You know what she's been
through.

58:54.200 --> 58:55.837
-We've all been through it.

58:55.872 --> 58:57.872
But you wanna help people?
Help people.

58:57.907 --> 59:00.578
-That's easy for you to say,
you're not from here.

59:02.208 --> 59:05.143
-Theo, you're not--
you're not actually thinking--

59:05.178 --> 59:08.047
-I'm not thinking about it.
I'm doing it.

59:08.082 --> 59:09.213
You don't get it.

59:09.248 --> 59:10.984
-How do I not get it?

59:11.019 --> 59:13.184
I'm literally in it
with you every single day.

59:14.891 --> 59:15.956
-[Natalie] Excuse us.
-[Theo] Hey.

59:23.229 --> 59:25.702
-Look, when I was a kid,

59:25.737 --> 59:27.638
Xochitl and I used to go out
and dance in the rain

59:27.673 --> 59:29.134
'cause that's just what kids do.

59:29.169 --> 59:30.872
And every time we did,

59:30.907 --> 59:33.842
the rain would burn the shit
out of my skin.

59:33.877 --> 59:35.712
I'd go inside
covered in little red welts

59:35.747 --> 59:36.812
all over my neck and arms.

59:37.947 --> 59:39.947
So yeah, you don't get it.

59:43.216 --> 59:44.886
I love you,
but I have to do this.

59:46.219 --> 59:48.087
I have to go out
with one big "fuck you"

59:48.122 --> 59:50.089
to the people
who did this to me.

59:50.124 --> 59:51.860
-[groaning] Fuck!
-[Theo] Are you okay?

59:51.895 --> 59:53.730
-Get it off! Get it off!
-[Theo] Shit, are you okay?

59:53.765 --> 59:54.797
[Alisha] Get it off.

59:54.832 --> 59:57.734
[groaning in pain]

59:59.265 --> 1:00:00.132
[Shawn] It's alright.

1:00:00.167 --> 1:00:02.002
-[groaning in pain]

1:00:02.037 --> 1:00:02.970
-[Theo] It's gonna be okay.
-I'm just gonna turn it, okay?

1:00:03.005 --> 1:00:04.235
[Alisha cries out]

1:00:04.270 --> 1:00:05.709
[Dwayne] There we go,
there we go.

1:00:09.781 --> 1:00:11.209
-Oh shit.

1:00:11.244 --> 1:00:13.684
Oh fuck.
-Oh fuck.

1:00:13.719 --> 1:00:15.279
Just breathe, just breathe,
it's gonna be okay.

1:00:15.314 --> 1:00:16.753
[Dwayne] It's broken. Okay.

1:00:16.788 --> 1:00:19.250
Shawn, I need two sticks

1:00:19.285 --> 1:00:21.692
about the same size
as her shin now, please.

1:00:21.727 --> 1:00:23.826
-We-we can't have any evidence,
any blood, DNA, nothing.

1:00:23.861 --> 1:00:26.092
-I fucking know, Xochitl!
-[Theo] Fuck.

1:00:26.127 --> 1:00:27.962
[Dwayne] You're gonna be
okay, all right?

1:00:27.997 --> 1:00:28.864
You're gonna be okay.
-[Theo] Here, just hold my hand.

1:00:28.899 --> 1:00:29.898
Hold my hand.

1:00:29.933 --> 1:00:32.736
[Alisha moaning in pain]

1:00:36.071 --> 1:00:37.840
[Dwayne] That's pretty good,
thank you, yeah.

1:00:37.875 --> 1:00:38.775
All right.

1:00:38.810 --> 1:00:39.435
Okay, all right.

1:00:39.470 --> 1:00:41.107
[Alisha cries out]

1:00:41.142 --> 1:00:43.846
-[Theo] Here, here, here.
-[Dwayne] It's okay.

1:00:45.410 --> 1:00:46.915
-Just breathe, just breathe.

1:00:46.950 --> 1:00:47.949
Just breathe,
don't look at it, okay?

1:00:47.984 --> 1:00:49.951
Don't look at it.

1:00:49.986 --> 1:00:51.887
[Dwayne] Just gonna put this on
nice and gently, okay?

1:00:51.922 --> 1:00:53.086
-Here, just hold my hand.

1:00:53.121 --> 1:00:54.824
Hold my hand.
-[Dwayne] Gonna be okay.

1:00:54.859 --> 1:00:57.992
There you go.
You're doing great. Doing great.

1:00:58.027 --> 1:00:59.257
-What the fuck is this, huh?
-I don't fucking know.

1:00:59.292 --> 1:01:00.863
I told you it was fraying.

1:01:00.898 --> 1:01:02.491
Like 20 times...
-Just breathe through it.

1:01:02.526 --> 1:01:04.130
-[Shawn] I tried to stop you.
-Just breathe through it.

1:01:04.165 --> 1:01:05.868
[Shawn] And what did you do?
You kept going.

1:01:05.903 --> 1:01:07.804
[Theo] It's gonna be okay.
It's all gonna be okay.

1:01:07.839 --> 1:01:08.772
Right, Dwayne?

1:01:11.040 --> 1:01:12.776
[Xochitl] Can we just leave
the bomb under the pipe?

1:01:12.811 --> 1:01:14.272
Will that work?

1:01:14.307 --> 1:01:15.911
[Michael] If you wanna
blow a hole in the ground,

1:01:15.946 --> 1:01:17.374
then yeah, sure.

1:01:18.916 --> 1:01:21.147
-Well then,
what the fuck do we do?

1:01:21.182 --> 1:01:23.116
-Why don't we just braid it?

1:01:23.151 --> 1:01:24.249
-Braid what?

1:01:24.284 --> 1:01:26.185
-The--
-[Shawn] The strap.

1:01:26.220 --> 1:01:27.153
[Logan] God.

1:01:28.860 --> 1:01:30.992
The fuck is taking them so long?

1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:37.999
[Rowan] Everything's fine.

1:01:41.301 --> 1:01:42.267
It's all gonna be fine.

1:01:44.337 --> 1:01:45.941
[Dwayne] Come on, come on,
you got this.

1:01:48.880 --> 1:01:50.341
All right, we're ratcheting.

We can't.
-Have you seen her leg?

1:06:08.469 --> 1:06:10.403
-Yes, but she needs an alibi,
Theo.

1:06:10.438 --> 1:06:11.470
-Okay, but you heard
what Dwayne said.

1:06:11.505 --> 1:06:13.175
She could be bleeding out or--

1:06:13.210 --> 1:06:15.210
-Okay, if I have to go
pick up Michael and Shawn,

1:06:15.245 --> 1:06:16.244
then I have to clean right now.

1:06:16.279 --> 1:06:17.509

It's two o'clock.
You got the game on?

the bomb or they're gonna...

1:09:38.646 --> 1:09:40.250
-Okay. Fuck them.

1:09:40.285 --> 1:09:41.515
-Logan.
-What?

1:09:41.550 --> 1:09:42.846
They're part of the problem,
Rowan.

1:09:42.881 --> 1:09:44.551
-We are not fucking murderers.

1:09:47.292 --> 1:09:48.456
-Fuck, fine.
Okay, stay here.

1:09:48.491 --> 1:09:49.457
-What?

1:09:52.429 --> 1:09:54.330
[Earl] I don't know, bud.
The towers are over there.

1:09:55.894 --> 1:09:59.665
There it is, about a mile
and a half to the north.

1:09:59.700 --> 1:10:01.271
[Hank] Yeah, looks about right.

1:10:02.736 --> 1:10:03.834
-[thump]
-[Hank] You hear that?

1:10:05.409 --> 1:10:07.310
[air hissing out]

1:10:10.843 --> 1:10:12.645
[Earl] You got some
old ass tires.

1:10:12.680 --> 1:10:13.679
[Hank] It looks like
they got cut.

1:10:13.714 --> 1:10:15.318
-What in the hell?

1:10:18.323 --> 1:10:19.553
[Hank] We're gonna
have to call it in.

1:10:19.588 --> 1:10:20.356
[Earl] Yeah.

1:10:21.656 --> 1:10:23.293
-What are you doing?
-[Earl] Hey!

1:10:23.328 --> 1:10:24.327
Somebody's fuckin' with us.

1:10:24.362 --> 1:10:24.789
They cut the phone.

1:10:25.759 --> 1:10:26.758
-I'm gonna run. -What?

1:10:26.793 --> 1:10:28.298
[Earl] Show your face, shitheel!

1:10:28.333 --> 1:10:29.893
- I'm gonna run.
You're gonna do the valve.

1:10:29.928 --> 1:10:31.565
I was all-state, bitch.
-[Rowan] No, you weren't.

1:10:31.600 --> 1:10:33.303
-I was close.
-[Earl] You're on JDIA property.

1:10:33.338 --> 1:10:34.700
-[Rowan] You weren't.
-I know. I know.

1:10:34.735 --> 1:10:35.800
I'll meet you at the car, okay?

1:10:35.835 --> 1:10:38.605
-Okay, okay. Be careful.

1:10:38.640 --> 1:10:39.870
-[Hank] There!
-[Earl] Hey!

1:10:39.905 --> 1:10:41.872
Stop or I'll shoot!

1:10:41.907 --> 1:10:43.841
Hey! You little shit!

1:10:43.876 --> 1:10:45.480
[shots fired]

1:10:45.515 --> 1:10:48.483
[sirens wailing]

1:10:56.427 --> 1:10:57.360
[Rowan] Fuck.

1:11:01.498 --> 1:11:03.333
[chain fence clanks]

1:11:03.368 --> 1:11:04.631
[running footsteps]

1:11:04.666 --> 1:11:07.568
[sirens continue wailing]

1:11:09.803 --> 1:11:11.836
[Officer] Freeze!

1:11:11.871 --> 1:11:12.837
Stop right there!

1:11:12.872 --> 1:11:14.509
-Suck my dick.

1:11:14.544 --> 1:11:15.741
-[soft thud]
-[Rowan groans]

1:11:28.723 --> 1:11:29.887
[Agent Rhodes]
[sighs] I get it, you know.

1:11:31.858 --> 1:11:33.330
I do. I do.

1:11:34.795 --> 1:11:37.631
I get what it's like to...
come from nothing,

1:11:38.898 --> 1:11:40.733
and to feel like
the only way forward

1:11:40.768 --> 1:11:41.899
is just to burn it all down.

1:11:45.740 --> 1:11:47.542
[paper rustles]

1:11:50.679 --> 1:11:53.647
One screw up like this shouldn't
destroy your life, Rowan,

1:11:53.682 --> 1:11:55.517
but it will.

1:11:55.552 --> 1:11:57.552
We mess up, we fall in
with the wrong people.

1:11:57.587 --> 1:11:59.389
-Well, I'm not with anyone.

1:11:59.424 --> 1:12:00.621
[Agent Rhodes] Oh! really?

1:12:00.656 --> 1:12:01.490
-Nope.

1:12:02.988 --> 1:12:05.461
-This is destruction
of critical infrastructure

1:12:05.496 --> 1:12:07.826
on federal property.
Terrorism.

1:12:09.566 --> 1:12:11.698
The best a lawyer's
gonna get you is 15 years.

1:12:12.833 --> 1:12:13.964
And that's if you plead out.

1:12:16.738 --> 1:12:21.411
You have a lot of promise and
it's all going to go to waste.

1:12:25.450 --> 1:12:29.881
Or, we can work together.

1:12:37.627 --> 1:12:39.429
-Hey, Ro.

1:12:39.464 --> 1:12:41.431
Ro, Ro, Ro, Ro, Ro, you okay?

1:12:44.997 --> 1:12:46.535
-I got fucked.

1:12:46.570 --> 1:12:48.031
-Wait, how did you
get out so quick?

1:12:49.606 --> 1:12:51.034
-Rowan. Rowan,
what the fuck happened?

1:12:51.069 --> 1:12:52.607
-I handled it, okay?

1:12:52.642 --> 1:12:53.608
-What do you mean?

1:12:53.643 --> 1:12:55.071
-I handled it.

1:12:55.106 --> 1:12:56.611
I just wanna go home.

1:12:56.646 --> 1:12:57.810
-Wait, what did
they charge you with?

1:12:57.845 --> 1:12:59.449
-I just really wanna go.

1:13:01.618 --> 1:13:03.486
-Rowan, what the fuck
did you do? Rowan!

1:13:08.625 --> 1:13:09.855
They were bluffing, though.

1:13:09.890 --> 1:13:13.595
-No, they weren't.
-Yes, they fucking were.

1:13:13.630 --> 1:13:15.223
Do you care about any of this?
This is what you signed up for.

1:13:15.258 --> 1:13:16.697
-Yes, I care.

1:13:16.732 --> 1:13:17.896
And it's way harder
when I don't have

1:13:17.931 --> 1:13:19.568
a family lawyer on standby.

1:13:19.603 --> 1:13:20.602
-Fuck you.

1:13:20.637 --> 1:13:21.999
-Yeah, you're good at pretending

1:13:22.034 --> 1:13:23.539
you would've done things
differently in there,

1:13:23.574 --> 1:13:24.837
but we both know
you would've never

1:13:24.872 --> 1:13:26.707
had to make that decision.

1:13:26.742 --> 1:13:28.940
-I never would have called
my dad's lawyer.

1:13:28.975 --> 1:13:31.008
-Yeah, but the point is
that you could have.

1:13:32.682 --> 1:13:34.583
-Who the fuck are you?

1:13:34.618 --> 1:13:35.881
-I am your fucking partner.

1:13:38.787 --> 1:13:40.853
Do you want me to rot
in prison for 15 years?

1:13:42.923 --> 1:13:45.858
-No. No, I don't want you
to fucking rot.

1:13:47.796 --> 1:13:51.028
I fucking love you.
You know I love you.

1:13:51.063 --> 1:13:54.801
I'm just, I'm not gonna
let you rat on our friends.

1:13:56.937 --> 1:13:57.804
-What am I supposed to do?

1:14:00.941 --> 1:14:03.744
-[exhales] Maybe we find
somebody else.

1:14:08.817 --> 1:14:10.850
[bookstore owner] Yeah, no,
it's pretty messed up this year.

1:14:12.084 --> 1:14:13.787
[Logan] World is ending.
[chuckles]

1:14:13.822 --> 1:14:16.086
-Yeah, yeah, kinda how
it feels. You know, it's like...

1:14:17.188 --> 1:14:18.792
Shit show.

1:14:18.827 --> 1:14:20.860
Hey, could you close the door?
The AC is on.

1:14:20.895 --> 1:14:23.764
[music playing
in the background]

1:14:37.912 --> 1:14:39.043
[Logan] That's got some good
shit.

1:14:40.816 --> 1:14:43.113
Doesn't teach you
how to do it, though.

1:14:43.148 --> 1:14:44.114
-Oh yeah?

1:14:45.953 --> 1:14:48.657
-Yeah. Is this for school
or somethin'?

1:14:48.692 --> 1:14:50.087
-Nah, I just wanna learn.

1:14:50.122 --> 1:14:52.122
Might be headed to Texas
for the winter.

1:14:53.829 --> 1:14:55.631
-What's in Texas?

1:14:55.666 --> 1:14:56.258
-Just a project.

1:14:57.866 --> 1:15:00.603
Might be looking for
some collaborators.

1:15:00.638 --> 1:15:01.835
-What kinda project?

1:15:08.140 --> 1:15:10.140
[exhales]
Us against the world, babe.

1:15:13.684 --> 1:15:14.749
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1:15:16.918 --> 1:15:17.752
-Hello. What's up?

1:15:17.787 --> 1:15:18.720

1:15:18.755 --> 1:15:19.952
-Good.

1:15:20.988 --> 1:15:22.185
-Xochitl.

1:15:22.220 --> 1:15:23.890
[Logan] Good to meet ya, Xoch.

1:15:25.025 --> 1:15:26.992
You wanna come see a band play?

1:15:27.027 --> 1:15:29.929
[loud rock music playing]

1:15:31.900 --> 1:15:33.031

-Hey, Slim. Another round
over here, please.

1:16:30.959 --> 1:16:32.222
-That time?

1:16:32.257 --> 1:16:33.762
-Yup.

on the car, lean on the car.

Oh, my God.

1:19:58.430 --> 1:19:59.902

caught the fuckers.

The Feds told us
to wait until needed,

1:26:53.383 --> 1:26:53.909

1:26:59.851 --> 1:27:01.290
[Rowan] No, no I didn't.
I promise.

1:27:01.325 --> 1:27:02.819
They just told me
a whole different story,

1:27:02.854 --> 1:27:04.458
and by the time that
I realized it was happening--

1:27:04.493 --> 1:27:06.559
-Bullshit.

1:27:06.594 --> 1:27:08.495
-Hang on, I have...

1:27:08.530 --> 1:27:10.299
I have everything
you need right here.

you're still gonna get them.

He's three days into a bender.

It's 1643, County Road 13.

1:27:30.750 --> 1:27:32.420

1:27:32.455 --> 1:27:34.653

1:27:34.688 --> 1:27:36.391

somewhere else to be?

1:27:37.119 --> 1:27:38.855

I hear you in there, Xochitl.

1:30:49.817 --> 1:30:51.553
Give me one reason
not to turn your ass in

1:30:51.588 --> 1:30:53.522

-Of course,
you work with a cop.

1:31:05.899 --> 1:31:07.635
[Xochitl] She's not a cop.

1:31:07.670 --> 1:31:10.770
She's a 22-year-old kid
who got fucked over.

1:31:10.805 --> 1:31:13.069
She coulda turned us in,
but she came clean.

1:31:13.104 --> 1:31:14.774
This was her idea.

1:31:14.809 --> 1:31:17.040
Rowan feeds the FBI
exactly what we need her to

1:31:17.075 --> 1:31:20.978
so they catch us in the act
on site with evidence.

1:31:21.013 --> 1:31:22.584
The FBI gets to be the hero

1:31:22.619 --> 1:31:23.849
that caught the big,
bad terrorists.

1:31:35.731 --> 1:31:36.961
We have a right
to defend ourselves.

1:31:36.996 --> 1:31:38.765
We could set
a new legal precedent,

1:31:38.800 --> 1:31:40.734
and if we get off,
more people follow,

1:31:40.769 --> 1:31:42.131

1:31:42.166 --> 1:31:44.573
fossil fuel gets

That work is important,

The flashy shit scares people.

-Okay, so you scare
some oil companies,

1:32:01.889 --> 1:32:03.658
but you're really gonna
fuck over poor people.

1:32:03.693 --> 1:32:05.055
-Pay more for gas now.

1:32:05.090 --> 1:32:06.925

1:32:06.960 --> 1:32:09.961
-Who are you to decide?
You're not God, Xochitl.

1:32:09.996 --> 1:32:12.601
You don't get to decide
how people live and die.

1:32:12.636 --> 1:32:14.801
-Better me than the people
that are currently doing that.

1:32:14.836 --> 1:32:16.869
And Alisha, you are the one
trying to decide

1:32:16.904 --> 1:32:18.838
how Theo lives or dies,
and I'm really sorry,

1:32:18.873 --> 1:32:21.038
I hate to say it, but
we both know she's gonna die.

1:32:26.914 --> 1:32:30.113
I'm sorry. That was... harsh.

1:32:31.952 --> 1:32:34.755
[Alisha] Everyone just...

1:32:34.790 --> 1:32:36.955

she has nothing to lose...

1:32:38.189 --> 1:32:39.661

1:32:41.060 --> 1:32:42.664
It's not fucking fair.

1:32:46.703 --> 1:32:47.933
-I've lost people, too.

1:32:50.267 --> 1:32:53.070
I don't want you to lose Theo
any sooner than you have to.

1:32:55.173 --> 1:32:56.645
But she's my best friend, too,

1:32:56.680 --> 1:32:58.075
and I know
that she needs to do this.

We can protect you,
we can get you a good alibi.

-Even if I wanted to, there'd
be fingerprints, DNA, hair.

1:33:16.799 --> 1:33:18.062
-We can clean that up.
