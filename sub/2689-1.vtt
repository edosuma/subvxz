01:31.717 --> 01:34.136
Turn to your right.

01:41.351 --> 01:42.644
That's it, sir.
You're done.

01:42.728 --> 01:44.146
Please follow
the orange line.

02:05.918 --> 02:07.503
We processed
the roll of film

02:07.628 --> 02:09.505
we found in your bag,
Mr. Parrish.

02:09.588 --> 02:11.423
They're not very
pretty pictures.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.509
Also, you left
the camera in the hotel.

02:13.592 --> 02:15.177
We processed
that roll as well.

02:15.302 --> 02:17.804
Can I see them?

02:17.888 --> 02:20.057
That's not a courtesy,
Mr. Parrish.

02:20.224 --> 02:22.017
This is evidence.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.894
Do you guys have
your own lab....

02:24.061 --> 02:26.313
or do you have
to send it out?

02:28.857 --> 02:29.733
We have a lab.

02:31.902 --> 02:32.819
Your legal aide

02:32.903 --> 02:35.948
should be here within
30 minutes or so.

02:36.073 --> 02:37.699
Now you understand you
don't have to talk to me

02:37.783 --> 02:40.369
until she gets here
if you don't want to.

02:40.494 --> 02:41.828
You know that, Sy?

02:41.912 --> 02:43.372
- Mm-hmm.
- Good.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.041
Sy, can I ask you
one question?

02:46.166 --> 02:48.335
Sure.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.712
What was it
about William Yorkin

02:50.838 --> 02:52.548
that upset you so?

02:52.631 --> 02:55.551
I mean, what did he do
to provoke all of this?

03:08.772 --> 03:13.777
Family photos
depict smiling faces...

03:16.947 --> 03:20.784
births, weddings, holidays...

03:20.868 --> 03:22.077
Happy birthday!

03:22.202 --> 03:24.621
Children's
birthday parties.

03:27.291 --> 03:28.208
People take pictures

03:28.292 --> 03:31.378
of the happy moments
in their lives.

03:31.503 --> 03:35.007
Someone looking through
our photo album would conclude

03:35.132 --> 03:38.677
that we had led a joyous,
leisurely existence...

03:40.721 --> 03:42.264
free of tragedy.

03:45.017 --> 03:47.060
No one ever takes
a photograph

03:47.144 --> 03:50.272
of something
they want to forget.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.698
Hey, we're gonna go.

03:59.823 --> 04:01.491
Sure you
don't need my help?

04:01.658 --> 04:02.743
Yeah.

04:02.868 --> 04:04.369
Sorry, kiddo.
I gotta work.

04:04.494 --> 04:07.080
Doesn't matter.

04:07.206 --> 04:09.166
I'm gonna get some takeout
for dinner, okay?

04:09.333 --> 04:10.375
Okay.

04:10.501 --> 04:11.877
- See ya.
- See ya.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.091
Jake, are you coming
or what?

04:19.176 --> 04:21.303
I'm coming!

04:26.433 --> 04:27.559
There's one.

04:27.684 --> 04:28.560
Okay.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.825
Mom, can I check out
the toys?

04:43.951 --> 04:45.869
Just for a minute. I'm just
dropping off some film.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.204
Make sure
you can see me, okay?

04:47.329 --> 04:48.497
Okay.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.499
Hey, Mrs. Yorkin.

04:50.582 --> 04:51.834
Hey, Yoshi.
How are you?

04:51.959 --> 04:53.377
How have you been?
Long time no see.

04:53.460 --> 04:54.962
We're doin' good,
thanks.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.675
- Got 3 rolls today.
- Okay.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.760
Can I get that
address again?

05:01.885 --> 05:02.761
Yes, it's 3--

05:02.886 --> 05:05.180
326 Serrano Terrace,
Yoshi.

05:05.264 --> 05:07.516
I'll take care
of Mrs. Yorkin.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.476
What have we got today?

05:09.560 --> 05:10.853
Two rolls, and I think

05:10.978 --> 05:12.187
I've got one
in here as well.

05:12.271 --> 05:14.565
And can I have 2 prints
of each, please?

05:16.900 --> 05:18.735
Leica Mini-Lux.

05:18.861 --> 05:20.112
That's a very nice camera.

05:20.237 --> 05:21.363
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.198
Because Will's been trying
to get me to go digital--

05:23.282 --> 05:25.993
Oh, don't do that.
I'd be out of a job.

05:29.246 --> 05:32.249
Hey. Oh.

05:32.374 --> 05:33.542
You have one shot left.

05:33.667 --> 05:34.877
Oh, that's okay.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.003
Oh, it's a shame
to waste it.

05:36.086 --> 05:37.629
Oh, no, really,
it's fine.

05:37.754 --> 05:39.631
Oh, no, please.
I look horrible.

05:52.269 --> 05:53.687
How's Jake doing?

05:53.770 --> 05:54.897
Oh, he's great.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.899
Just had a birthday,
and--

05:56.982 --> 05:59.902
Oh. How old is he, 9?

05:59.985 --> 06:01.612
That's right.
He just turned 9.

06:06.825 --> 06:09.077
Hmm. Got a winner.

06:11.288 --> 06:12.498
Thanks.

06:14.124 --> 06:15.417
When do you need these by?

06:15.542 --> 06:16.668
Can I have them today?

06:16.793 --> 06:20.797
Oh. You know, we close
at 7:00 on Sundays.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.174
Oh, well,
it's not important.

06:22.299 --> 06:24.426
I can--I can
swing by tomorrow.

06:24.510 --> 06:27.387
Mrs. Yorkin, you're one
of our best customers.

06:27.471 --> 06:29.515
I'll have 'em for you
by the time we close.

06:29.640 --> 06:31.266
Thank you so much.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.309
No problem.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.810
I'll go get some
shopping done.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.062
We'll see you
in 40 minutes.

06:35.145 --> 06:36.271
Thanks, Sy.

06:36.355 --> 06:37.606
Bye.

06:37.689 --> 06:38.607
Bye.

06:40.484 --> 06:42.152
Hey,Jake.

06:49.243 --> 06:50.911
You sliced through
an exposure

06:51.036 --> 06:52.621
on that last roll, Sy.

06:52.788 --> 06:56.792
Yes, Yoshi, I know.
I made a mistake.

06:56.959 --> 06:58.669
Mrs. Levitt
has a problem...

06:58.794 --> 07:00.504
offer her
a free roll of film.

07:00.629 --> 07:01.588
All right.

07:11.181 --> 07:12.891
I've been doing
P.O.S. mini-lab work

07:13.016 --> 07:14.726
for over 20 years now.

07:14.852 --> 07:19.106
I consider it
an important job.

07:21.233 --> 07:22.860
When people's houses
are on fire...

07:23.026 --> 07:24.486
what's the first thing
they save

07:24.611 --> 07:26.905
after their pets
and their loved ones are safe?

07:28.699 --> 07:30.242
The family photos.

07:40.752 --> 07:43.714
Some people think that
this is a job for a clerk.

07:45.340 --> 07:47.342
They actually believe
that any idiot

07:47.467 --> 07:49.011
that attends
a 2-day seminar

07:49.136 --> 07:51.555
can master the art
of making beautiful prints

07:51.638 --> 07:52.806
in less than an hour.

07:57.477 --> 08:00.314
But of course,
like most things...

08:00.397 --> 08:02.524
there's far more to it
than meets the eye.

08:13.202 --> 08:15.662
I've seen the prints
they fob off on people

08:15.746 --> 08:17.456
at the Rexall or Fotek.

08:19.917 --> 08:22.211
Milky, washed out prints.

08:22.336 --> 08:23.879
Too dark prints.

08:25.756 --> 08:28.550
There's no sense of reverence

08:28.675 --> 08:31.136
for the service
they're providing for people.

08:33.804 --> 08:37.142
I process these photos
as if they were my own.

08:45.234 --> 08:47.736
I see someone had quite
a birthday party.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.571
I did them
5x7 for you.

08:49.696 --> 08:52.491
Oh, I wanted them
4x6.

08:52.616 --> 08:56.370
Um, the larger ones
are better.

08:56.495 --> 08:58.247
I didn't charge you
extra for them.

08:58.330 --> 09:00.916
Okay, um...
it's okay, I guess.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.334
How much
do I owe you, Sy?

09:02.459 --> 09:04.962
Uh, 30.06, but let's
just call it an even 30.

09:05.128 --> 09:06.630
All right, thanks.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.594
You know, we have a special
gift for birthday boys.

09:12.678 --> 09:13.720
Really?

09:13.804 --> 09:14.805
Mm-hmm. That's right.

09:14.930 --> 09:18.100
Birthday boys
get a free camera.

09:18.225 --> 09:20.602
Wow.Jake,
what do you say?

09:20.686 --> 09:22.980
Thanks.

09:23.105 --> 09:25.524
You're welcome, buddy.

09:25.649 --> 09:29.778
We're taking Jake to
Six Flags this weekend, so...

09:29.862 --> 09:31.405
I'll see you very soon.

09:31.488 --> 09:33.365
See you.

09:33.490 --> 09:34.950
- Come on,Jake.
- Bye.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.535
See ya,Jake.

09:44.668 --> 09:46.253
Well, what a cool
camera, huh?

09:46.336 --> 09:47.254
Yeah.

09:58.432 --> 09:59.558
Good night, A.J.

10:28.086 --> 10:30.839
That's just great.

10:33.383 --> 10:35.344
Oh, look at this.
This is a great shot.

10:35.427 --> 10:37.513
- I remember that.
- Nice truck.

10:37.638 --> 10:39.181
Oh, you guys
are so cute.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.724
Ah.

10:40.849 --> 10:41.725
You are so sweet.

10:41.850 --> 10:43.685
Okay, this one's
going into the trash.

10:43.810 --> 10:44.937
Let me see.

10:45.062 --> 10:46.188
Oh, yeah.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.607
Look at your face.
That's a classic.

10:48.732 --> 10:49.608
Will, I need that back.

10:49.733 --> 10:50.734
No, you're not
getting it back.

10:50.901 --> 10:51.777
Will, I'm serious.

10:51.902 --> 10:52.778
Don't give it to her.

10:52.903 --> 10:53.779
Better give it
to her.

10:53.904 --> 10:56.365
She's serious.
She's serious.

10:56.490 --> 10:58.408
Hey!

10:58.492 --> 10:59.535
Told you.

10:59.660 --> 11:03.288
Hey, how'd this one
get in here?

11:03.413 --> 11:05.040
- Oh, that's Sy.
- Sy?

11:05.165 --> 11:06.083
Sy, the photo guy.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.167
Oh, yeah.

11:07.251 --> 11:09.253
Sy took it
to finish off the roll.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.034
I get you
anything else, Sy?

11:41.118 --> 11:43.579
Oh, no, thanks.
Just the check's fine.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.248
What you got there,
family photos?

11:46.415 --> 11:47.541
Yeah.

11:47.624 --> 11:49.168
Yeah? You mind
if I take a look?

11:53.839 --> 11:56.216
Mmm, these are
beautiful.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.135
That's a good shot.

11:58.260 --> 12:00.053
These your,
uh, relations?

12:02.222 --> 12:04.141
Yes. That's my little
nephew,Jake.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.435
He's a handsome boy.

12:06.518 --> 12:08.145
Isn't he?

12:08.270 --> 12:11.273
Yeah. l, uh, I got him
a camera for his birthday.

12:11.398 --> 12:14.860
Oh. Well, you must be
his favorite uncle then.

12:14.985 --> 12:16.528
I don't know.

12:16.653 --> 12:19.364
Sure I can't get you
no more coffee then?

12:19.489 --> 12:20.991
Oh, no. I'm fine, thanks.

12:21.116 --> 12:23.285
Have a nice night now.

12:23.452 --> 12:25.496
You, too.

13:00.197 --> 13:02.533
Mom?

13:02.699 --> 13:05.661
What, pookie?

13:05.744 --> 13:08.163
I feel bad for someone.

13:08.247 --> 13:10.040
Somebody at school?

13:10.165 --> 13:12.334
No.

13:12.417 --> 13:14.962
What do you mean,
you feel bad?

13:15.045 --> 13:17.965
When someone seems sad...

13:18.048 --> 13:20.050
they don't have
any friends...

13:20.175 --> 13:22.594
and people
make fun of'em...

13:22.719 --> 13:25.264
that makes me
feel bad for them.

13:25.389 --> 13:28.600
Who is sad and doesn't
have any friends?

13:30.435 --> 13:31.436
Sy.

13:31.562 --> 13:33.647
Sy?

13:33.772 --> 13:36.316
The photo guy
at the one hour place?

13:36.441 --> 13:37.693
Yeah.

13:37.776 --> 13:38.819
Oh,Jake.

13:38.902 --> 13:42.239
I really
feel bad for him.

13:42.364 --> 13:45.492
But Jake...

13:45.576 --> 13:48.745
we don't know
that Sy is sad.

13:48.871 --> 13:54.751
We really don't know
that much about him, you know?

13:54.835 --> 13:58.255
I mean, he might even
have a lot of friends.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.756
He probably has a girlfriend

13:59.923 --> 14:04.011
and--and a mommy
and a daddy who love him.

14:04.136 --> 14:07.097
I don't think
he does.

14:07.222 --> 14:10.100
Oh. Tch.

14:10.184 --> 14:11.643
That is so sweet of you

14:11.768 --> 14:16.481
to think of somebody else
like that, you know?

14:16.607 --> 14:19.943
Listen,Jake...

14:21.778 --> 14:24.573
not everybody
is as lucky as we are.

14:24.656 --> 14:26.617
You know?

14:26.742 --> 14:31.455
But maybe if we send them
good thoughts...

14:31.622 --> 14:34.082
we'll make them
feel better.

14:36.919 --> 14:38.670
So why don't we
close our eyes

14:38.795 --> 14:40.672
and send Sy
some good thoughts?

14:40.797 --> 14:41.924
Okay.

14:42.007 --> 14:45.302
Okay? All right? Ready?

14:45.427 --> 14:47.095
Yeah.

15:13.372 --> 15:15.374
There.

15:19.169 --> 15:21.421
I bet the next time
we see Sy...

15:21.505 --> 15:23.882
he won't seem so sad.

15:24.007 --> 15:25.467
Okay.

15:27.177 --> 15:28.971
You have to go
to sleep, pookie.

15:29.096 --> 15:30.514
Okay.

15:32.182 --> 15:33.308
I love you.

15:37.354 --> 15:38.230
Good night.

15:38.355 --> 15:39.231
Good night.

16:08.343 --> 16:11.221
Tch, tch, tch.
There you go.

16:11.388 --> 16:13.015
Come on.

16:24.651 --> 16:24.818
How--How do you think
we pay for all this?

16:24.818 --> 16:27.029
How--How do you think
we pay for all this?

16:27.112 --> 16:29.489
I'm just asking you.
What do you think...

16:29.573 --> 16:30.699

33:49.321 --> 33:51.031
All right? All right.

33:51.114 --> 33:53.867
Pay attention, fellas.
A little focus.

33:55.577 --> 33:57.329
Drill it in there, Matt.
Come on!

33:57.454 --> 33:59.248
Good shot. Good shot.

34:02.459 --> 34:04.044
Next practice,
Thursday.

34:04.169 --> 34:06.630
If you can't make it,
be sure and tell Derrick.

34:08.632 --> 34:09.550
Hey,Jake.

34:09.632 --> 34:10.592
Hi.

34:10.676 --> 34:12.010
Toby, you forgot
your sweatshirt.

34:12.135 --> 34:13.053
I was just on my way
home from work.

34:13.136 --> 34:14.054
I saw you out there.

34:14.137 --> 34:15.514
I thought
I'd check it out.

34:15.639 --> 34:16.681
Jake.

34:16.806 --> 34:17.766
You all right?

34:17.850 --> 34:19.268
Yeah.

34:19.351 --> 34:20.393
Your mom
picking you up?

34:22.688 --> 34:25.107
Nah, I got my bike.

34:25.190 --> 34:28.150
That was a great shot
you made.

34:28.277 --> 34:30.112
But your coach
was a little rough.

34:30.195 --> 34:31.947
I thought he should be
more supportive.

34:32.030 --> 34:33.991
Do you want me to have
a word with him for you?

34:34.116 --> 34:35.576
Nah, it's okay.

34:35.659 --> 34:36.659
I will.

34:36.784 --> 34:37.744
No, thanks.

34:37.911 --> 34:38.786
Okay.

34:41.165 --> 34:43.167
When I was your age...

34:43.292 --> 34:44.960
I wasn't very good
at sports.

34:45.085 --> 34:46.837
Mmm.

34:46.962 --> 34:48.547
I was kinda
chubby kid.

34:48.672 --> 34:49.547
Oh.

34:49.672 --> 34:51.800
Let's face it.
I was fat.

34:51.925 --> 34:54.594
I was sick
all the time.

34:54.678 --> 34:57.556
Kept comin' down with
mono and hepatitis...

34:57.681 --> 34:59.725
and then I broke
my collarbone...

34:59.850 --> 35:01.143
and I had to wear
this weird cast

35:01.268 --> 35:04.771
where I kept my arm up
like this all winter.

35:04.897 --> 35:08.317
I wasn't exactly
the most popular kid.

35:08.442 --> 35:10.277
How'd you break
your collarbone?

35:10.360 --> 35:13.572
Oh, I fell
out of a tree.

35:13.697 --> 35:14.990
How's your dad
doing?

35:15.115 --> 35:16.575
Good.

35:16.700 --> 35:18.327
Does he come
to see the games?

35:18.452 --> 35:20.537
Yeah, sometimes.

35:20.662 --> 35:22.122
Does he come to see
any of the games?

35:22.206 --> 35:23.999
He's really busy
at work.

35:24.124 --> 35:27.753
I don't know. He's--
He's busy all the time.

35:27.878 --> 35:30.339
He sounds like
an important guy.

35:30.422 --> 35:33.634
I guess. He owns a company
and everything.

35:33.717 --> 35:35.636
Probably just wants
to make sure

35:35.719 --> 35:37.137
that you and your mom

35:37.221 --> 35:38.639
have all the nice things
you want...

35:38.722 --> 35:41.725
like that cool bike
and those soccer shoes.

35:41.808 --> 35:42.893
Hold on.

35:45.687 --> 35:49.525
Yeah. You know,
those things cost money.

35:49.608 --> 35:50.859
He'd be here
if he could.

35:50.943 --> 35:52.653
I guess.

35:52.736 --> 35:55.489
I got something for you.

36:05.916 --> 36:07.626
Wanna guess what it is?

36:12.673 --> 36:15.008
Whoa.

36:20.180 --> 36:21.598
What's wrong?

36:21.723 --> 36:24.560
It's--It's the one
you wanted.

36:24.643 --> 36:27.354
Mr. Parrish,
I can't take this.

36:27.437 --> 36:29.231
Sure you can,Jake.

36:29.356 --> 36:31.316
My parents won't let me.

36:33.610 --> 36:35.863
I'd better be
gettin' back home now.

36:35.946 --> 36:37.364
You sure?

36:37.447 --> 36:41.326
Yeah. Thanks anyway,
Mr. Parrish.

36:41.451 --> 36:43.287
Okay, see you
around the store.

36:43.412 --> 36:44.288
Okay.

36:47.499 --> 36:48.542
Hey,Jake.

36:48.667 --> 36:49.918
The name's Sy.

36:50.085 --> 36:51.503
Okay, Sy.

37:34.379 --> 37:36.006
Well, there's--

37:36.131 --> 37:39.259
There's been, like,
some kind of shift.

37:39.343 --> 37:43.805
I don't know.
A couple of weeks.

37:43.931 --> 37:47.559
Maybe five weeks.

37:47.684 --> 37:53.649
Six. No, I know that, but...

37:53.815 --> 37:58.028
Um, yeah, but this--

37:58.195 --> 38:01.323
This feels different,
you know?

38:01.448 --> 38:03.325
Listen,Jan...

38:03.450 --> 38:05.994
I can't talk right now.

38:06.119 --> 38:07.871
I'll call you back
this afternoon.

38:07.996 --> 38:13.043
Okay. I know.
I love you, too. Bye.

38:18.173 --> 38:19.049
Hi, Sy.

38:19.174 --> 38:21.385
Hi there.

38:21.510 --> 38:22.553
I was just
at the Dairy Queen.

38:22.678 --> 38:23.554
I saw you down here

38:23.679 --> 38:25.055
and thought
I'd say hello.

38:25.180 --> 38:28.392
I'm just grabbing
some shopping fuel.

38:28.559 --> 38:30.561
I never see you
away from the store.

38:30.686 --> 38:32.062
After all these years,
you'd think

38:32.229 --> 38:33.939
we'd run into each other
at some point.

38:34.064 --> 38:35.482
Why, do you live
around here?

38:35.566 --> 38:37.276
I live downtown.

38:37.401 --> 38:40.279
Mmm. Well,
that's quite a drive.

38:40.404 --> 38:42.030
No, I'm used to it.

38:47.244 --> 38:48.245
You have
a nice boy there.

38:48.370 --> 38:52.207
Oh,Jake. Yeah.

38:52.291 --> 38:54.793
A little sensitive,
maybe, but, um...

38:54.918 --> 38:56.461
- he likes you, Sy.
- Aw.

38:56.587 --> 38:58.630
He calls you
"Sy the photo guy."

38:58.755 --> 39:00.174
You know,
I've watched him grow

39:00.257 --> 39:01.758
since he was this big.

39:01.842 --> 39:03.051
That's right.

39:03.135 --> 39:06.013
You've been doing our pictures
for a long time.

39:06.096 --> 39:10.225
You know, I almost feel
like "Uncle Sy."

39:12.603 --> 39:15.397
Well, I've got some

39:15.480 --> 39:17.274
serious shopping
to do, Sy.

39:17.399 --> 39:19.651
Oh, sure.

39:22.905 --> 39:24.448
Take care.

39:27.618 --> 39:29.703
Oh, my God.

39:29.786 --> 39:30.871
What?

39:30.954 --> 39:34.166
That's so weird.
l--l--I'm--

39:34.291 --> 39:36.585
I'm reading that exact
book right now.

39:36.668 --> 39:38.212
You're kidding.

39:38.378 --> 39:42.382
No. I can't believe that
you'd be reading that book.

39:42.508 --> 39:44.676
You know, he writes a lot

39:44.801 --> 39:46.595
about noticing coincidence,
doesn't he?

39:46.678 --> 39:48.764
Yeah, he does.

39:48.889 --> 39:50.807
That thing he says
about fear--

39:52.184 --> 39:53.101
Oh.

39:56.813 --> 39:58.899
"The things we fear
the most

39:58.982 --> 40:00.943
have already
happened to us."

40:03.320 --> 40:05.447
Wow.

40:05.531 --> 40:08.033
I had no idea you were
such a deep thinker, Sy.

40:08.158 --> 40:13.205
I wouldn't say that.

40:13.330 --> 40:15.958
Do you have
any children, Sy?

40:16.083 --> 40:19.670
Me? No. No.
I'm not married.

40:19.795 --> 40:21.129
No girlfriend?

40:21.255 --> 40:22.130
No.

40:26.635 --> 40:28.470
I have a snapshot
of my mother, though.

40:35.519 --> 40:36.478
Hmm.

40:39.439 --> 40:41.859
She looks very nice.

40:42.025 --> 40:43.485
She's passed away.

40:45.654 --> 40:49.908
Oh. Well, um...

40:50.033 --> 40:50.951
I'm sorry, Sy.

40:55.205 --> 40:57.916
Gosh, you know,
I have to go.

40:58.041 --> 41:00.711
Um, it was really nice
chatting with you.

41:00.836 --> 41:02.963
It was nice
chatting with you.

41:03.046 --> 41:04.047
Um...

41:04.131 --> 41:05.883
I'll probably
see you very soon.

41:06.008 --> 41:06.967
We can't seem to go a day

41:07.092 --> 41:08.802
without taking a picture
of something, so--

42:00.521 --> 42:02.814
Sy Parrish,
please see the manager.

42:02.940 --> 42:06.235
Sy to the manager's office
immediately, please.

42:19.456 --> 42:21.416
What's with the getup, Sy?

42:21.583 --> 42:22.709
It's Wednesday, Bill.

42:22.793 --> 42:24.419
I was doin' the SRS.

42:24.586 --> 42:27.714
Sy, there's been some
discrepancies

42:27.840 --> 42:28.757
in the click count.

42:28.841 --> 42:32.177
Oh, well,
that's probably Yoshi.

42:32.302 --> 42:33.637
You know, his math skills
are pretty weak...

42:33.762 --> 42:34.638
but I told you about that

42:34.763 --> 42:35.848
when you moved him over
from audio.

42:35.973 --> 42:36.932
No, all the discrepancies

42:37.057 --> 42:38.767
are on the logs
that you initialed.

42:38.892 --> 42:40.602
- They are?
- Yeah.

42:40.727 --> 42:41.937
Oh. l, you know...

42:42.062 --> 42:44.439
I guess sometimes
the end of the week

42:44.565 --> 42:45.774
you get
a little tired--

42:45.858 --> 42:48.235
We're not talking about
a few innocent math errors, Sy.

42:48.318 --> 42:52.156
The net clicks all zero out.
They always zero out.

42:52.281 --> 42:54.116
The problem is, Sy,
that the shutdown clicks

42:54.241 --> 42:55.242
don't correspond at all.

42:55.325 --> 42:57.494
I mean, they don't even
come close to matching

42:57.661 --> 42:59.913
the amount of prints
that we sold.

42:59.997 --> 43:01.665
Well, then,
it's probably a problem

43:01.832 --> 43:03.125
with the reorder
counter.

43:03.208 --> 43:05.878
Well, I asked Larry
about that.

43:06.003 --> 43:07.129
What did he say?

43:07.254 --> 43:09.214
Well, he looked
at the counter

43:09.339 --> 43:11.175
and said that
it checked out.

43:11.300 --> 43:14.178
He also said that
in 14 years of servicing...

43:14.303 --> 43:16.763
he's never seen a faulty
counter on an AGFA unit.

43:16.889 --> 43:18.640
Really?

43:18.765 --> 43:19.766
So the question is, Sy...

43:19.892 --> 43:22.311
where did all those
unaccounted for prints go?

43:22.394 --> 43:24.104
Well, what kind
of discrepancy

43:24.188 --> 43:25.272
are we talking
about, Bill?

43:25.397 --> 43:27.941
We're talking about
hundreds of prints, Sy.

43:28.066 --> 43:29.693
Oh!

43:29.818 --> 43:31.403
That's not possible,
Bill.

43:31.528 --> 43:33.071
Oh, no.
I've done the math...

43:33.197 --> 43:34.323
and the P.O.s
confirm it, too.

43:34.490 --> 43:36.783
Well, I don't know
anything about it.

43:36.867 --> 43:39.286
Oh, I think you do, Sy.

43:40.787 --> 43:43.165
Well, I don't, Bill.

43:43.290 --> 43:46.502
Look, Sy,
I've got a family.

43:46.627 --> 43:49.338
I'm not losing my job
over this.

43:55.052 --> 43:56.678
I'm lettin' you go.

43:56.803 --> 43:57.679
No.

44:00.182 --> 44:01.808
Oh.

44:07.940 --> 44:09.858
These log discrepancies
would be enough...

44:09.942 --> 44:11.485
but you've been
spacing out on the job...

44:11.610 --> 44:12.861
taking 90 minute
lunch breaks...

44:12.945 --> 44:15.531
creating scenes in front
of the customers...

44:15.614 --> 44:17.324
giving away free merchandise.

44:17.407 --> 44:18.617
What?

44:18.742 --> 44:21.119
Free disposable cameras
to customers on their birthday?

44:21.245 --> 44:23.205
That must have been
your bright idea.

44:23.288 --> 44:24.706
Sure as shit
isn't company policy.

44:24.832 --> 44:25.707
You can't do this.

44:25.833 --> 44:27.167
It's done, Sy.

44:27.251 --> 44:29.253
I talked to Sims
at district.

44:29.336 --> 44:32.214
Now you finish out the week
and clear out your locker.

44:32.297 --> 44:34.132
And if you do somethin'
like fuck up today's prints--

44:34.258 --> 44:36.718
I haven't fucked up
a customer's prints

44:36.802 --> 44:39.388
in 11 years.

44:39.555 --> 44:42.140
Just get back out there.

45:36.236 --> 45:37.654
Hey, Sy.

45:39.531 --> 45:40.699
Sy.

45:44.912 --> 45:47.289
Jake wanted to get his
birthday gift processed.

45:50.584 --> 45:51.460
I'm sorry?

45:51.585 --> 45:52.794
The camera.

45:56.715 --> 45:59.593
Right. The birthday gift.

46:04.890 --> 46:06.058
Number of sets?

46:06.183 --> 46:07.434
Oh, just one is fine.

46:10.437 --> 46:12.397
4x6? 5x7?

46:12.523 --> 46:15.943
Um, the ones
we usually get.

46:16.068 --> 46:18.111
Standard.

46:18.278 --> 46:20.280
Jake had a really great
time with the camera.

46:20.447 --> 46:21.323
Didn't you,Jake?

46:21.448 --> 46:23.909
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

46:28.705 --> 46:31.625
What was that
address again?

46:31.708 --> 46:37.005
It's 326 Serrano Terrace.

46:38.715 --> 46:40.509
Sy, are you all right?

46:40.634 --> 46:41.885
I'm fine.

46:44.263 --> 46:46.473
I'll have these
for you tomorrow.

46:48.475 --> 46:50.811
All right. Thanks, Sy.

46:50.894 --> 46:51.895
Bye.

46:53.981 --> 46:55.524
Bye.

51:01.144 --> 51:02.980
Oh.

52:04.208 --> 52:06.251
I'm leaving early
today, Yoshi.

52:06.376 --> 52:08.212
Okay, Sy.

52:10.214 --> 52:12.257
I won't be
coming back, Yoshi.

52:12.382 --> 52:13.759
Bill let me go.

52:16.428 --> 52:17.387
You were fired?

52:17.513 --> 52:18.847
Yep.

52:18.972 --> 52:19.848
Really?

52:19.973 --> 52:21.308
Really.

52:21.391 --> 52:23.310
Wow.

52:25.270 --> 52:29.691
I've really enjoyed
working with you, Yoshi.

52:29.817 --> 52:31.276
Yeah, me, too, Sy.

52:34.238 --> 52:36.365
Sy?

52:36.490 --> 52:38.659
Sy, I just wanted to, um...

52:38.742 --> 52:41.620
well, I guess I just wanted
to say thank you, you know?

52:41.745 --> 52:43.997
For what?

52:44.081 --> 52:46.625
For teachin' me
all this stuff.

52:46.750 --> 52:49.753
You're welcome, Yoshi.

52:49.878 --> 52:52.840
Don't let the place
go downhill, okay?

52:52.965 --> 52:54.174
I won't, Sy.

55:19.903 --> 55:20.821
Here they are.

55:20.904 --> 55:23.490
Oh, my pictures.
Let me see. Let me see.

57:35.581 --> 57:37.291
Come on.

57:42.880 --> 57:45.465
What the hell's
wrong with these people?

58:07.946 --> 58:10.574
The universe grows smaller

58:10.699 --> 58:12.576
every day.

58:12.701 --> 58:14.912
There must be security
for all...

58:15.037 --> 58:16.830
or no one is secure.

58:18.540 --> 58:22.753
It is no concern of ours
how you run your own planet.

58:22.878 --> 58:25.839
But if you threaten
to extend your violence...

58:25.923 --> 58:28.258
this earth of yours
will be reduced

58:28.383 --> 58:30.093
to a burned-out cinder.

58:32.471 --> 58:36.225
Now, we do not pretend
to have achieved perfection.

58:36.350 --> 58:39.770
But we do have a system,
and it works.

58:42.064 --> 58:43.899
Your choice is simple:

58:44.024 --> 58:46.401
join us and live in peace

58:46.527 --> 58:51.532
or pursue your present course
and face obliteration.

58:51.657 --> 58:54.743
We shall be waiting
for your answer.

58:55.953 --> 58:58.747
The decision rests with you.

59:39.329 --> 59:40.664
Aah!

59:40.789 --> 59:41.874
Ah!

01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:49.691
According to
the Oxford English Dictionary...

01:00:49.858 --> 01:00:53.153
the word "snapshot"
was first used in 1808

01:00:53.237 --> 01:00:57.157
by an English sportsman by
the name of Sir Andrew Hawker.

01:00:57.241 --> 01:00:58.826
He noted in his diary

01:00:58.909 --> 01:01:01.411
that almost every bird
he shot that day

01:01:01.537 --> 01:01:04.039
was taken by snapshot...

01:01:04.164 --> 01:01:09.169
meaning a hurried shot
taken without deliberate aim.

01:01:51.044 --> 01:01:52.212
Can I help you,
Sy?

01:01:52.337 --> 01:01:54.256
Just dropping off
some film.

01:01:54.339 --> 01:01:56.133
Just a customer.

01:01:56.258 --> 01:01:58.218
I can still shop here,
can't l, Bill?

01:01:58.385 --> 01:02:00.262
No, Sy, you can't
still shop here.

01:02:00.345 --> 01:02:01.763
- I believe I can, Bill.
- Shh.

01:02:01.847 --> 01:02:03.682
There's no law that says

01:02:03.765 --> 01:02:06.351
I can't shop here
just because I was fired.

01:02:06.477 --> 01:02:07.436
I checked it out.

01:02:07.519 --> 01:02:08.437
There's a thousand
other places

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:09.771
you could do
your photos.

01:02:09.855 --> 01:02:11.982
There's no reason to come
all the way down here

01:02:12.107 --> 01:02:13.567
other than
to fuck with me.

01:02:13.650 --> 01:02:15.235
There's
a very good reason.

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:17.362
I calibrated that machine
personally.

01:02:17.488 --> 01:02:19.615
It's the best mini-lab
in the state.

01:02:22.701 --> 01:02:25.120
All right, Sy.
Just this one time.

01:02:25.204 --> 01:02:26.622
But I'm telling you...

01:02:26.705 --> 01:02:28.457
find another place
to do your film.

01:02:28.582 --> 01:02:30.375
I do not want you
back in here.

01:02:30.501 --> 01:02:31.835
Thanks, Bill.

01:03:15.963 --> 01:03:17.589
What is it, Yoshi?
You can't just

01:03:17.673 --> 01:03:19.550
leave your station
unmanned down there.

01:03:19.675 --> 01:03:21.593
I think you need
to see these, sir.

01:03:21.677 --> 01:03:22.928
What have you got
there?

01:03:23.011 --> 01:03:24.721
Is it the anal sex
fiend again?

01:04:02.509 --> 01:04:05.012
Motherfucker.

01:04:28.994 --> 01:04:30.204
What would you say

01:04:30.287 --> 01:04:33.373
Mr. Parrish's demeanor
was when he came in?

01:04:33.499 --> 01:04:34.541
Demeanor?

01:04:34.625 --> 01:04:36.210
Yeah. How did he seem?

01:04:36.293 --> 01:04:39.254
Did he seem upset
or agitated in any way?

01:04:39.379 --> 01:04:42.090
Um...I don't know.
He seemed fine.

01:04:42.216 --> 01:04:44.218
Sy and I had some words
when he came into the store.

01:04:44.343 --> 01:04:46.845
Under the circumstances,
I was surprised to see him...

01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:49.348
and I asked him
what he was doing here...

01:04:49.473 --> 01:04:51.558
and I...I suggested
in strong language

01:04:51.683 --> 01:04:52.935
that in the future

01:04:53.018 --> 01:04:54.937
he bring his pictures
somewhere else.

01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:56.271
Yoshi, I'm gonna
need to make

01:04:56.355 --> 01:04:57.898
some Xerox copies
of this.

01:04:57.981 --> 01:04:59.942
Can you show me where
I can get that done?

01:05:00.025 --> 01:05:01.068
Yeah.

01:05:01.151 --> 01:05:04.279
Mr. Owens, why don't you
come and grab a seat

01:05:04.404 --> 01:05:05.906
and try to calm down?

01:05:10.953 --> 01:05:12.871
Your wife and child,
they're, uh...

01:05:12.955 --> 01:05:14.289
they're somewhere
safe now?

01:05:14.373 --> 01:05:16.583
Uh...they're
at my mother's.

01:05:16.667 --> 01:05:19.253
I'm--I'm sorry.
I'm just a little upset.

01:05:19.378 --> 01:05:21.630
No, no, no, no.
I understand. It's...

01:05:21.755 --> 01:05:23.340
It's understandable.

01:05:23.465 --> 01:05:25.926
So how did he take
his being fired?

01:05:26.051 --> 01:05:28.762
I've had to fire
a lot of people, Detective.

01:05:28.846 --> 01:05:31.098
People get upset
when they get fired.

01:05:31.181 --> 01:05:33.225
He got pretty upset.

01:05:33.308 --> 01:05:35.102
He knew that Mr. Araki
would see the photos...

01:05:35.185 --> 01:05:36.770
and he knew
he'd show them to you

01:05:36.854 --> 01:05:38.021
and that
you'd call us.

01:05:38.147 --> 01:05:39.356
I think
it's just a warning.

01:05:39.481 --> 01:05:41.400
But you have to
take it seriously.

01:05:41.483 --> 01:05:43.694
Oh, we take it
very seriously.

01:05:43.819 --> 01:05:45.988
Your child's life has been
indirectly threatened.

01:05:46.113 --> 01:05:47.489
We take no chances
in this county.

01:05:47.614 --> 01:05:49.491
There's an APB out
on his white Toyota.

01:05:49.575 --> 01:05:51.076
Officers are en route
to his apartment now

01:05:51.201 --> 01:05:52.786
with a search warrant.

01:05:52.911 --> 01:05:55.330
I've got plainclothes
officers on standby

01:05:55.455 --> 01:05:57.166
inside the store and out.
Now, look...

01:05:57.249 --> 01:05:58.792
he may come back
and pick up his photos.

01:05:58.876 --> 01:06:00.669
He may not.
It's hard to say.

01:06:00.752 --> 01:06:02.254
I doubt he will.

01:06:02.337 --> 01:06:04.256
You really think
that's a good idea?

01:06:04.339 --> 01:06:06.341
I mean, this place
is wall-to-wall families.

01:06:06.466 --> 01:06:09.136
If he's stupid enough
to come back here...

01:06:09.219 --> 01:06:11.597
he'll never make it
inside the store.

01:06:11.722 --> 01:06:13.682
Are you insane?

01:06:13.765 --> 01:06:15.767
Mr. Parrish,
this is the police!

01:06:15.851 --> 01:06:17.811
I'm just
trying to make--

01:06:17.895 --> 01:06:19.271
If you're in
the apartment...

01:06:19.354 --> 01:06:20.856
we need to know
right now!

01:06:20.981 --> 01:06:22.191
That's crazy.

01:06:22.357 --> 01:06:23.650
Can you explain this?

01:06:23.734 --> 01:06:25.068
Kill that TV.

01:06:25.194 --> 01:06:27.905
He must be
programmed for courage.

01:06:29.114 --> 01:06:30.449
Mr. Parrish!

01:06:35.954 --> 01:06:37.539
It's clear.

01:07:10.781 --> 01:07:14.868
Officer Lyon.
Double 6, 3-2-1.

01:07:14.952 --> 01:07:16.078
Go ahead, 3-2-1.

01:07:16.203 --> 01:07:18.747
I need to be patched through
to Van Der Zee in TMU.

01:07:18.872 --> 01:07:20.332
Right away, please.

01:07:20.415 --> 01:07:21.917
3-2-1,
that's a 10-4.

01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:24.795
Hey, Dan...

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:26.547
take a look at this.

01:07:26.672 --> 01:07:28.882
What do you got?

01:07:32.261 --> 01:07:34.596
Y-O-R-K-l-N.

01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:36.098
I'm sorry, sir.

01:07:36.181 --> 01:07:38.225
I don't find
that name registered.

01:07:38.350 --> 01:07:41.103
Could you try
a Maya Burson?

01:07:41.186 --> 01:07:42.980
B-U-R-S-O-N.

01:07:43.105 --> 01:07:45.566
Let me check that
for you, sir.

01:07:45.691 --> 01:07:47.943
I'll ring that room
for you now, sir.

01:07:48.026 --> 01:07:49.069
Thank you.

01:07:50.612 --> 01:07:51.572
Hello?

01:07:51.697 --> 01:07:53.115
Hello. This is
room service.

01:07:53.198 --> 01:07:54.950
I'm sorry
to bother you...

01:07:55.033 --> 01:07:57.077
but we have your order
all ready to go here.

01:07:57.202 --> 01:07:58.620
We just needed to know

01:07:58.704 --> 01:08:00.038
if you'd like coffee
with that.

01:08:00.122 --> 01:08:02.249
Uh...Will, did you
want coffee?

01:08:02.374 --> 01:08:04.293
No, just the drinks.

01:08:04.418 --> 01:08:06.295
And this is for
room 217.

01:08:06.378 --> 01:08:09.590
Um...no.
We're 511, right?

01:08:09.673 --> 01:08:11.633
We're 511.

01:08:11.758 --> 01:08:13.093
511.

01:08:13.177 --> 01:08:14.428
Oh, my gosh.

01:08:14.511 --> 01:08:16.430
I must be looking
at the wrong thing here.

01:08:16.513 --> 01:08:17.598
I'm sorry.

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:19.475
We'll have it right up
to you in just a minute.

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:20.934
Okay, thanks.

01:08:22.478 --> 01:08:24.104
Hotel operator.

01:08:24.188 --> 01:08:25.772
Room service, please.

01:08:25.856 --> 01:08:27.441
One moment, please.

01:08:28.692 --> 01:08:30.109
Room service.
This is Jon.

01:08:30.194 --> 01:08:31.612
May I take
your order please?

01:08:31.737 --> 01:08:33.697
Hello,Jon. This is
Will Yorkin in 511.

01:08:33.822 --> 01:08:35.741
We've decided
to go out for lunch.

01:08:35.823 --> 01:08:38.202
I was wondering if it's
okay to cancel our order.

01:08:38.327 --> 01:08:40.203
No problem.
That was 511, right?

01:08:40.328 --> 01:08:42.372
That's right,Jon.
Thank you very much.

01:08:42.497 --> 01:08:44.791
You're welcome,
Mr. Yorkin.

01:08:50.005 --> 01:08:50.964
Yes?

01:08:51.048 --> 01:08:52.256
Nina Yorkin?

01:08:52.341 --> 01:08:53.258
Yes.

01:08:53.341 --> 01:08:54.926
Hi. I'm Detective
Van Der Zee

01:08:55.010 --> 01:08:56.636
of the Evans County
Threat Management Unit.

01:08:56.761 --> 01:08:58.805
This is
Detective Outerbridge.

01:08:58.930 --> 01:09:00.182
Threat management?

01:09:00.307 --> 01:09:02.017
Is Jake all right?

01:09:02.142 --> 01:09:03.352
No, no.
Everyone's fine.

01:09:03.435 --> 01:09:05.270
We, uh...actually,
we need to speak with

01:09:05.395 --> 01:09:06.688
your husband William.

01:09:06.814 --> 01:09:08.273
Will's at work.

01:09:08.398 --> 01:09:10.024
What's this about?

01:09:10.192 --> 01:09:13.069
Do you mind if we
come in for a minute?

01:09:13.194 --> 01:09:14.654
No. Sure.

01:09:34.216 --> 01:09:35.591
How can I help you,
sir?

01:09:35.716 --> 01:09:38.053
Hi. I need a room.

01:09:38.178 --> 01:09:40.221
But not too high
a foor.

01:09:40.389 --> 01:09:42.975
I'll check, sir.

01:09:44.725 --> 01:09:48.147
Yes, we can offer you
313.

01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:49.731
Mmm.

01:09:49.857 --> 01:09:51.524
Anything on 5?

01:09:51.608 --> 01:09:54.153
I'll check, sir.

01:09:54.236 --> 01:09:55.279
Will Yorkin's
office.

01:09:55.404 --> 01:09:56.405
Duane, this is Nina.

01:09:56.530 --> 01:09:57.739
I need to talk to Will
right now.

01:09:57.865 --> 01:10:00.075
He's not in, Mrs. Yorkin,
but I can have him return

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:01.410
as soon as he gets back.

01:10:01.535 --> 01:10:03.412
Duane, I need you to get him
on the phone immediately.

01:10:03.537 --> 01:10:04.746
This is an emergency.

01:10:04.830 --> 01:10:08.041
Okay. I'll try him right now.
I'll put you on hold.

01:10:08.125 --> 01:10:09.418
No, Duan--

01:10:12.212 --> 01:10:14.423
He--He's trying
right now.

01:10:51.293 --> 01:10:53.253
Where's your son,
Mrs. Yorkin?

01:10:53.337 --> 01:10:54.922
He's at his friend
Eric's house.

01:10:55.047 --> 01:10:56.632
It might be a good idea

01:10:56.757 --> 01:10:59.718
to have Eric's mother
drive him home now.

01:10:59.801 --> 01:11:01.053
Oh, my God.

01:11:37.923 --> 01:11:38.841
Mrs. Yorkin?

01:11:38.924 --> 01:11:39.842
Yes, Duane.

01:11:39.925 --> 01:11:41.760
I called his cell.
There was no answer.

01:11:41.844 --> 01:11:43.595
But I left him
a 911 pager.

01:11:43.679 --> 01:11:45.430
He should call you
the second he--

01:11:45.514 --> 01:11:47.266
Duane, I know
he's fucking Maya Burson...

01:11:47.349 --> 01:11:49.268
and I don't give a shit
about that right now.

01:11:49.351 --> 01:11:51.478
I just need you to tell me
where he is!

01:12:01.196 --> 01:12:02.656
Room service.

01:12:04.867 --> 01:12:06.577
Can you just leave it

01:12:06.702 --> 01:12:08.579
outside the door,
please?

01:12:08.704 --> 01:12:11.665
No, ma'am. I'm afraid
you have to sign for this.

01:12:13.458 --> 01:12:15.210
Uh, just a second.

01:12:32.561 --> 01:12:33.479
You--

01:12:33.562 --> 01:12:35.063
Get on the bed.

01:12:35.147 --> 01:12:37.816
Get on
the goddamn bed!

01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:39.568
Look, I've got plenty
of cash in my pants

01:12:39.693 --> 01:12:40.903
in the wallet
in the bathroom--

01:12:40.986 --> 01:12:42.237
Shut up!

01:12:42.362 --> 01:12:43.822
Close the drapes.

01:12:43.906 --> 01:12:44.823
Close them!

01:12:50.662 --> 01:12:51.747
Who told you
to do that?

01:12:51.872 --> 01:12:52.998
I closed the drapes.

01:12:53.081 --> 01:12:55.250
Did I tell you to wrap
a towel around yourself?

01:12:55.375 --> 01:12:56.919
No.

01:12:57.044 --> 01:12:58.921
Let me explain
what's going on here.

01:12:59.046 --> 01:13:01.882
I tell you to do things,
then you fucking do them

01:13:02.007 --> 01:13:03.175
exactly like I tell you.

01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:05.469
I'm gonna tell you this
one time

01:13:05.594 --> 01:13:06.887
and one time only.

01:13:06.970 --> 01:13:07.971
You get the picture?

01:13:08.096 --> 01:13:09.598
Yeah.

01:13:09.681 --> 01:13:11.725
Do you understand me?

01:13:11.850 --> 01:13:13.268
Yes.

01:13:13.352 --> 01:13:14.394
Good.

01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:16.230
Now get on the bed.

01:13:20.984 --> 01:13:22.945
- No!

01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:30.452
Am I talking
to a brick wall?

01:13:30.536 --> 01:13:31.912
Did I tell you
to touch her?

01:13:31.995 --> 01:13:33.580
No.

01:13:33.705 --> 01:13:35.582
I don't want you
to touch her.

01:13:35.666 --> 01:13:38.877
If you touch her again,
I stab you in the heart.

01:13:43.382 --> 01:13:44.925
Unit 0-1 -1 -4...

01:13:45.008 --> 01:13:46.969
proceed to Deerfield,
The Edgerton Hotel

01:13:47.094 --> 01:13:48.303
at Hunter Valley Road.

01:13:48.428 --> 01:13:49.888
TMU officers
en route to scene.

01:13:49.972 --> 01:13:51.807
Can you ring the room
once more, please?

01:13:51.890 --> 01:13:53.433
I'll try it
one more time.

01:13:55.185 --> 01:13:57.396
Now, missy, have to
take the robe off.

01:13:59.398 --> 01:14:01.233
No.

01:14:01.316 --> 01:14:02.693
- Aah!

01:14:02.818 --> 01:14:04.778
I'm not asking.

01:14:04.862 --> 01:14:06.196
I'm telling.

01:14:09.324 --> 01:14:10.784
Off!.

01:14:12.911 --> 01:14:14.872
She can do it!

01:14:20.002 --> 01:14:21.295
The person in this room

01:14:21.378 --> 01:14:23.088
is not available
to take your call.

01:14:23.172 --> 01:14:24.798
Please leave a message.

01:14:33.557 --> 01:14:35.767
What's this?
What's this?

01:14:38.145 --> 01:14:39.646
Can't you stop
your sniveling?

01:14:41.773 --> 01:14:43.942
This is supposed
to look like fun.

01:14:47.946 --> 01:14:49.490
Okay.

01:14:51.074 --> 01:14:52.159
No touching!

01:14:53.243 --> 01:14:54.495
Smile.

01:14:54.578 --> 01:14:56.455
You have to look like
you're having fun...

01:14:56.538 --> 01:14:57.831
like it's a game.

01:15:01.084 --> 01:15:02.127
Come on!

01:15:04.046 --> 01:15:05.464
Smile!

01:15:07.591 --> 01:15:09.426
Wipe your nose.
You look disgusting.

01:15:19.561 --> 01:15:20.562
Now...

01:15:20.687 --> 01:15:22.105
put his thing
in your mouth.

01:15:27.903 --> 01:15:29.446
Don't do it!

01:15:29.571 --> 01:15:33.408
Pretend.
This is all pretend.

01:15:33.492 --> 01:15:35.786
I'm doing it!
Stop yelling at me.

01:15:35.911 --> 01:15:37.538
You're not doing it
the right way. Like this!

01:15:37.621 --> 01:15:39.373
Oh, God!

01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:46.088
No!

01:15:50.592 --> 01:15:52.594
Winds churning at their base

01:15:52.761 --> 01:15:55.806
can exceed 260
miles per hour.

01:15:55.931 --> 01:15:58.267
But the scientists chase them.

01:15:58.392 --> 01:16:00.018
Tornadoes can be an obsession.

01:16:56.408 --> 01:16:57.326
Mr. Belmer?

01:16:57.409 --> 01:16:58.327
Yes.

01:16:58.410 --> 01:16:59.453
I'm Detective
Van Der Zee.

01:16:59.578 --> 01:17:00.746
This is
Detective Outerbridge.

01:17:00.829 --> 01:17:02.080
We just spoke
on the phone.

01:17:02.164 --> 01:17:04.625
Right. So, uh...
what is all this about?

01:17:04.708 --> 01:17:06.043
Any word from
Miss Burson's room yet?

01:17:06.168 --> 01:17:07.044
No.

01:17:07.169 --> 01:17:08.587
Have you seen this man?

01:17:11.048 --> 01:17:13.842
This guy just checked in
about...half an hour ago.

01:17:13.967 --> 01:17:16.011
What room?

01:17:16.136 --> 01:17:17.971
I put him in 519.

01:17:18.055 --> 01:17:20.432
Mr. Belmer, I need
a passkey now, please.

01:18:04.059 --> 01:18:05.978
Mr. Parrish,
this is the police.

01:18:06.061 --> 01:18:07.396
Will you open
the door, please?

01:18:46.435 --> 01:18:49.229
The retinal implant

01:18:49.313 --> 01:18:51.857
is a microelectronic
prosthesis

01:18:51.940 --> 01:18:56.028
that can reverse the effects
of retinal degeneration.

01:18:56.111 --> 01:18:57.112
We owe a--

01:19:13.629 --> 01:19:15.255
James.

01:19:19.927 --> 01:19:21.303
Let's find Yorkin.

01:19:48.956 --> 01:19:50.374
Check 511.

01:20:00.884 --> 01:20:03.262
Bravo, where is it?
Where is it?

01:20:08.767 --> 01:20:11.061
It's the rear
kitchen-access.

01:20:11.186 --> 01:20:13.730
It's in the back,
rear kitchen-access.

01:20:27.161 --> 01:20:28.871
Miss Burson?

01:20:43.844 --> 01:20:45.637
Police! Freeze!

01:20:51.935 --> 01:20:53.645
William Yorkin?

01:20:57.524 --> 01:20:59.401
Drop the bag!

01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:03.906
Do it!

01:22:02.297 --> 01:22:04.174
I just took pictures.

01:22:04.299 --> 01:22:06.009
You have the
right to remain silent.

01:22:06.135 --> 01:22:08.220
If you give up the right
to remain silent...

01:22:08.303 --> 01:22:09.847
anything you say can and
will be used against you

01:22:09.972 --> 01:22:10.931
in a court of law.

01:22:11.014 --> 01:22:12.766
Outerbridge? We got him.

01:22:12.850 --> 01:22:14.101
...the right to speak
with an attorney

01:22:14.184 --> 01:22:15.602
and to have the attorney
present during questioning.

01:22:15.686 --> 01:22:17.980
If you so desire
and cannot afford one--

01:22:34.872 --> 01:22:35.914
Dad!

01:24:20.018 --> 01:24:21.687
Are you married,
Detective?

01:24:21.770 --> 01:24:23.772
You have any children?

01:24:23.897 --> 01:24:25.941
I'll be the one asking
the questions here, Sy.

01:24:26.066 --> 01:24:29.528
I know.
Just one question.

01:24:29.611 --> 01:24:31.947
Detective,
are you a family man?

01:24:32.030 --> 01:24:33.782
That's none of your
business, Sy.

01:24:33.866 --> 01:24:35.617
Sir, you're right,
it isn't.

01:24:35.701 --> 01:24:37.536
It is none
of my business.

01:24:37.619 --> 01:24:40.414
But I'm guessing by your answer
and that ring on your finger

01:24:40.497 --> 01:24:42.082
that you are...

01:24:42.207 --> 01:24:45.085
and that makes you
a very fortunate man.

01:24:45.169 --> 01:24:48.213
I can also tell by the way
that you've treated me so far

01:24:48.338 --> 01:24:51.925
and the way you carry out
your job, you're a good man...

01:24:52.050 --> 01:24:53.886
good husband and father...

01:24:53.969 --> 01:24:56.597
a man who appreciates
his good fortune.

01:24:58.682 --> 01:25:02.853
You're not the type of father
who'd cheat on his wife...

01:25:02.978 --> 01:25:05.939
hurt his family,
betray their trust.

01:25:14.156 --> 01:25:17.451
You would never neglect
and abuse your children.

01:25:20.204 --> 01:25:23.582
Make horrible demands
of your children.

01:25:25.834 --> 01:25:27.419
You would never ask...

01:25:32.591 --> 01:25:34.927
you would never ask
your children

01:25:35.010 --> 01:25:37.304
to do things...

01:25:39.515 --> 01:25:42.142
things that
children shouldn't do.

01:25:44.019 --> 01:25:46.897
You would never take
disgusting, sick...

01:25:47.022 --> 01:25:49.483
degraded pictures
of your children

01:25:49.566 --> 01:25:51.902
d--doing these things.

01:26:02.037 --> 01:26:04.873
You would never treat
your children like animals.

01:26:19.721 --> 01:26:22.724
Will Yorkin had it all,
and he threw it all away.

01:26:27.646 --> 01:26:29.773
He's not a good father.

01:26:44.246 --> 01:26:46.665
Well, l, uh...ahem.

01:26:49.293 --> 01:26:51.920
I think I understand
now, Sy.

01:26:53.297 --> 01:26:56.592
Thank you for answering
my question so candidly.

01:26:56.758 --> 01:26:58.427
You're welcome.

01:27:01.346 --> 01:27:04.308
Can I see my pictures
now?

01:27:09.229 --> 01:27:10.522
Sure, Sy.

01:27:12.149 --> 01:27:13.567
Thank you.
