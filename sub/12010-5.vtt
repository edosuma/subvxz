WEBVTT

00:05.606 --> 00:10.601
Sturdy and reliable, this big unit
would work well in any modern home.

00:10.607 --> 00:13.005
Oh, wicked! I love a slave auction.

00:13.006 --> 00:15.623
15 - that's one-five previous
owners -

00:15.632 --> 00:18.373
but very little sign of wear and
tear.

00:18.374 --> 00:20.115
Let's just watch this guy.

00:20.120 --> 00:23.385
Special skills include cooking,
cleaning and flower arranging.

00:23.394 --> 00:26.227
He's also a qualified masseur.
Bloody show-off.

00:26.233 --> 00:29.931
So, let's start the bidding at 50
denari. Do I hear 50 denari?

00:29.944 --> 00:33.096
Thank you, sir. 55? 55... 55 with
you, madam.

00:33.110 --> 00:36.284
I'm looking for 60. 60 denari? 60
with you, sir.

00:36.288 --> 00:38.882
What are you doing?
Just having a cheeky bid.

00:38.899 --> 00:42.188
What for? He can look after the
horses while I'm at work.

00:42.189 --> 00:44.577
65 with you, madam.
How can we afford it?

00:44.591 --> 00:47.174
I'll remind you that you can pay in
one lump sum

00:47.192 --> 00:50.708
or bite-size monthly instalments
Bite-size monthly instalments.

00:50.716 --> 00:52.423
Back with you, sir, at 70.
Ow!

00:52.426 --> 00:57.011
It's another of your impulse purchases. You
already bought the aubergine. We'll eat it!

00:57.029 --> 00:59.964
What do you reckon?
He looks like a psycho. What? How?

00:59.973 --> 01:03.068
The hat - it's a psycho's hat.
Nah, hat's the best bit.

01:03.093 --> 01:06.734
75... 75 back with you, madam. 80,
anyone? Hold his finger, Grumio.

01:06.745 --> 01:09.498
Who'll give me 80? 80...
Yes, please! I will!

01:09.513 --> 01:12.858
80! Anyone else? At 80, going once,
going twice...

01:12.871 --> 01:14.817
Sold to the man with the big hair!

01:30.012 --> 01:33.494
If you'd just like to sign there,
lovely.

01:33.509 --> 01:37.789
Great. And here is your s-
My name is Mushki.

01:37.790 --> 01:41.697
I look forward to sewing you in any
way I can. I hope you like horses.

01:41.698 --> 01:43.647
I'm allergic to horses.
Perfect.

01:43.657 --> 01:46.941
But I look forward to sewing you in
any other way I can.

01:46.942 --> 01:50.110
All our slaves are non-refundable, as
per our warranty.

01:50.115 --> 01:53.688
Can I interest you in an insurance
policy against damage or theft?

01:53.707 --> 01:55.681
Theft of slaves?
Oh, yes, yes.

01:55.682 --> 01:58.940
There've been several slave-mappings
in the last few weeks.

01:58.942 --> 02:02.435
Mainly at night. If you need
insurance, or a security device?

02:02.453 --> 02:05.400
No, no. We'll. risk it.
May I carry your bag, sir?

02:05.414 --> 02:08.223
Oh. Sure. Thanks.

02:08.228 --> 02:12.278
Mm-mm! And you, sir?
I don't have a bag.

02:12.292 --> 02:15.102
No, may I carry YOU, sir? On my
back.

02:15.127 --> 02:17.275
I'm extremely robust.

02:17.276 --> 02:21.759
Uh, yeah, sure. Thank you very much.

02:21.776 --> 02:25.132
You're welcome very much.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.147
Just...

02:27.161 --> 02:28.868
Right.

02:41.430 --> 02:43.376
Hai-ya!

02:43.386 --> 02:46.321
Hai-ya! Hai-ya!

02:47.963 --> 02:49.943
Hai-ya!
All right?

02:49.947 --> 02:53.645
Hey, guys. Can you give me a hand?
Metella's left the key inside.

02:53.651 --> 02:57.485
I left the key inside with you.
Then I left it inside on its own.

02:57.491 --> 03:00.517
Either way, we're locked out.
Can't Landlord let you in?

03:00.528 --> 03:03.577
For a whopping fee. It'd be cheaper
to rent another flat.

03:03.589 --> 03:06.297
Here. Let me have a go, then.
This'll be good.

03:06.309 --> 03:08.380
Ah... So...

03:14.724 --> 03:15.691
OK.

03:17.558 --> 03:19.000
Argh!

03:19.001 --> 03:19.968
Ah, OK.

03:22.513 --> 03:24.117
Yeah, that's not gonna work.

03:24.133 --> 03:26.625
If I might try, sin'? Here.

03:26.634 --> 03:29.569
Ah, yes, he is extremely robust.

03:29.588 --> 03:33.172
Do either of you ladies have a
brooch or hair grip I could use?

03:35.499 --> 03:36.705
Thank you.

03:36.719 --> 03:39.416
And then it's simply a case of...

03:40.972 --> 03:42.620
And... there we are.

03:42.621 --> 03:44.419
Wow!
That's amazing.

03:44.448 --> 03:46.826
Thanks a million.
You're welcome a million.

03:48.852 --> 03:52.538
Oh, sorry. This is Mushki - our new
slave.

03:56.655 --> 03:59.409
Ah! Dinner is served.

03:59.410 --> 04:02.357
Chicken stew with braised peppers
and aubergine.

04:02.365 --> 04:05.517
Ah! See, I told you we'd eat it.
Thank you, Mushki. Mm-mm!

04:05.525 --> 04:07.471
Aren't you going to join us?

04:07.482 --> 04:11.203
I feel it's inappropriate for a
slave to dine with his masters.

04:11.206 --> 04:12.708
I couldn't agree more.

04:12.717 --> 04:15.698
Oh, could you grab the salt, please?

04:15.717 --> 04:17.628
The salt, sir?

04:17.639 --> 04:21.541
As you're up. It's just on the side.
Of course.

04:21.550 --> 04:24.508
Oh! This stew is... nice.

04:24.516 --> 04:27.668
We've never had NICE food in this
flat. Much obliged, sir.

04:27.685 --> 04:30.108
I've been told stews are my
speciality.

04:30.124 --> 04:33.698
What would you say your speciality
is, Grumio?

04:33.699 --> 04:37.738
Road-kill? Slop from a bin?
Maybe cheese rolls?

04:37.758 --> 04:41.991
That's not cooking, that's you rolling up
lumps of cheese with your filthy mitts.

04:41.999 --> 04:44.479
Call 'em what you like, they're
bloody gorgeous.

04:46.241 --> 04:48.323
Oh, yeah, that's it. Right there.

04:48.350 --> 04:49.420
Yeah.

04:49.442 --> 04:52.787
I... couldn't help but notice that
you enjoy your salt, sir.

04:52.804 --> 04:54.749
Yeah, I like salt on my food.

04:54.750 --> 04:57.503
Oh, indeed you do - you were heaping
it on.

04:57.504 --> 04:59.877
Ow.
Before you'd even tasted it.

04:59.878 --> 05:03.837
Oh. Ow. Even though I'd
already added seasoning...

05:04.914 --> 05:07.861
...to a level befitting the dish.

05:07.886 --> 05:10.912
I'm sorry about the salt, I should
have tried it first!

05:10.968 --> 05:13.972
No, no. You're the boss, sir.

05:13.988 --> 05:17.151
Let's put you to bed, shall we?
Oh, no, I do that myself.

05:17.176 --> 05:19.804
You did. You've got me now.

05:19.814 --> 05:21.761
In you pop, then.
I...

05:21.762 --> 05:25.346
Let's make you nice and... comfy,
shall we?

05:27.746 --> 05:30.488
Are you comfortable, sin'?
Er, yes and no.

05:30.489 --> 05:32.225
Goodnight, then.

05:32.227 --> 05:35.936
Night, Mushki. Thanks for everything.
You're welcome for everything.

05:39.051 --> 05:42.043
What are you doing now?
Waiting for you to fall asleep.

05:42.047 --> 05:45.460
My work's not done until you're in
the Land of Nod.

05:45.468 --> 05:48.597
So, shut your eyes.
There really is no -

05:48.611 --> 05:50.261
Shh! Shut your eyes!

05:50.268 --> 05:51.895
Sir.

05:59.212 --> 06:03.017
How long did he stay there for? I
don't know, I was too soared to look.

06:03.018 --> 06:06.512
But he was still there in the
morning. That's dedication for you.

06:06.513 --> 06:09.062
He's pounded the shit out
of my back.

06:09.078 --> 06:11.297
I can barely shred!
Oh, you poor thing!

06:11.298 --> 06:14.040
'My slave's over-massaged me!' My
heart bleeds!

06:14.051 --> 06:17.737
What will he do next? Over-fluff
your pillows? Over-suck your nob?

06:17.773 --> 06:21.595
I think he was punishing me for
putting salt on my food.

06:21.596 --> 06:24.827
Well, you shouldn't have done. That
was unbelievable stew!

06:24.848 --> 06:28.671
You two are such babies needing
slaves to run around after you.

06:28.682 --> 06:32.732
My slave doesn't jog, let alone run.
Don't you still live with your parents?

06:32.751 --> 06:36.551
In a separate annex - I have my own
door. Your mum does your cooking?

06:36.579 --> 06:39.403
Well - And your laundry?
If she's putting a load on.

06:39.404 --> 06:41.543
And wipes your bum.
She doesn't do that.

06:41.558 --> 06:44.061
Your dad does that?
No-one does that! No-one?!

06:44.069 --> 06:46.709
You never wipe your bum?
Must be grim down there!

06:46.742 --> 06:49.552
Grim bum! Grim bum!
My bum is as clean as a whistle!

06:49.568 --> 06:53.163
Right. Though not as tuneful I
expect, water man. Water boy!

06:53.164 --> 06:55.644
Water man! Thank you. Thank you.

06:58.978 --> 07:02.208
Sorry to intrude. It's Flavia's
birthday on Friday,

07:02.209 --> 07:05.585
and she's demanded a spontaneous
whip-round for a pressie. Ooh!

07:05.596 --> 07:08.099
What are we getting hen'?
I don't know yet.

07:08.107 --> 07:10.485
That rather depends on the
contributions.

07:10.505 --> 07:12.951
The average so far has been around
15. Oh.

07:12.952 --> 07:15.312
Put me down... for two.

07:15.313 --> 07:19.253
And... one from me.
Well, whatever you can afford.

07:19.254 --> 07:22.428
If she wants better gifts she should
pay better wages.

07:22.429 --> 07:25.555
Put me down for 40.
Oh, marvellous!

07:25.572 --> 07:29.714
40 denari? She's a good boss, and I
want to show my appreciation.

07:29.726 --> 07:33.742
She won't find out who gave what,
you know. Won't she?

07:33.778 --> 07:37.453
No, it's done anonymously. Still 40?

07:40.345 --> 07:41.949
Yes, still 40.

08:05.002 --> 08:06.620
It's called a plate.

08:06.621 --> 08:08.168
Please use it.

08:16.579 --> 08:20.379
Not getting in your way, I hope.
No, no. You do your thing.

08:20.390 --> 08:24.679
And this is your thing, is it,
sitting there like a pudding?

08:24.680 --> 08:28.165
I sometimes sit outside... like a
pudding.

08:28.166 --> 08:31.841
And what service do you provide?

08:31.848 --> 08:35.886
I suppose, like, comments, trivia, I
can burp songs.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.087
Parts of songs.

08:38.113 --> 08:42.232
Well, I hope for your sake that's
sufficient.

08:42.249 --> 08:44.752
I've worked for enough masters to
know

08:44.767 --> 08:48.214
that anyone not providing an
essential service tends to get...

08:50.076 --> 08:52.056
squeezed out.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.981
Oh. Hiya!
Hey!

09:10.989 --> 09:14.139
Taking no chances this time.
Oh! Good idea.

09:14.140 --> 09:16.984
Thanks so much for your slave's help
yesterday.

09:16.992 --> 09:20.348
Not Grumio, the good one.
Mushki? Yeah, he's great, isn't he?

09:20.361 --> 09:23.115
Don't you think he's creepy? I find
him creepy.

09:23.116 --> 09:26.813
He did seem a bit... OTT, I guess.
Well, yeah, he is OTT,

09:26.814 --> 09:31.466
if OTT stands for 'Oh, that's...
terrific.' Which it doesn't.

09:31.484 --> 09:36.654
Because the aubergine stew he
made last night was terrific. In fact,
what are you doing later?

09:36.655 --> 09:39.479
Probably still trying to get into
our flat. Why?

09:39.480 --> 09:41.312
You should come round for dinner.

09:47.774 --> 09:51.130
Whoa!
There's shit-loads of flowers.

09:51.144 --> 09:54.107
I thought they might brighten the
place up a little.

09:54.108 --> 09:56.727
Yeah, how much did it cost?
Er, nothing, sir.

09:56.728 --> 10:01.409
At this time of year, the meadows
are strewn with gerania, croci,

10:01.410 --> 10:04.129
and lil-ai of the vall-ai.

10:04.188 --> 10:07.965
Oh! Also, I've made you some
Valerian tea, sir

10:07.981 --> 10:11.042
to alleviate your wretched back
pain.

10:11.068 --> 10:15.391
I fear I may have over-rubbed last
night. Oh, right. Thanks.

10:15.392 --> 10:19.858
Mm-mm! Oh, Mushki, I invited our
neighbours for dinner. Is that OK?

10:19.859 --> 10:22.376
Sorry it's such short notice.
Not at all, sir.

10:22.377 --> 10:24.535
I thrive in a dinner party scenario.

10:24.576 --> 10:27.182
I will rustle up another of my
signature stews.

10:27.198 --> 10:30.782
That would be magnificent. I'll
nip out and get a few more veggies.

10:30.790 --> 10:34.294
I have befriend a local grocer who
is giving me 'mate's rates'.

10:37.565 --> 10:41.354
Maybe he's all right. Are you kidding
me? The guy's incredible.

10:41.375 --> 10:43.321
He's bloody bonkers.
Is he, Grumio?

10:43.344 --> 10:46.075
For doing the housework? How bonkers
of him.

10:46.083 --> 10:50.438
My hat! Oh, Jove! Oh, holy Jove!
What? What's happened?

10:50.439 --> 10:52.794
There's something in my hat!
What is it?

10:52.795 --> 10:55.592
A jobby, sir. Rather a large one.

10:55.593 --> 10:59.405
It must have been an animal. What
kind of animal could shit in a hat?

10:59.406 --> 11:02.668
And then hang it on a peg?
Grumio?

11:02.680 --> 11:04.398
What?

11:04.409 --> 11:07.117
Are you saying I shat in his hat?
Yes, I am.

11:07.126 --> 11:10.657
Why would I when the bog's there?
Because you don't like him.

11:10.658 --> 11:14.258
That's the only way you know how
to express yourself. It weren't me.

11:14.259 --> 11:16.091
Who was it, then?
Him, probably.

11:16.106 --> 11:19.497
He shat in his own hat?
He's trying to stitch me up.

11:19.498 --> 11:22.200
He said he'd squeeze me like a
sponge.

11:22.219 --> 11:24.722
That's not what I said, sir.
I know, Mushki.

11:24.737 --> 11:28.219
Oh. So you're gonna believe him over
your own slave, are you?

11:28.263 --> 11:32.143
Come on, you're barely my slave -
you've never done any actual work.

11:32.149 --> 11:37.189
Is that right? Yeah, you just can't
take being shown up by someone
with a bit of get up and go.

11:37.194 --> 11:40.220
Oh, I'll show you 'get up and go'.
Clean the hat first.

11:40.238 --> 11:42.195
You dean the hat!
Yeah...

11:42.207 --> 11:45.388
I... may still be able to wear it

11:45.389 --> 11:47.437
if I put it inside-out.

11:51.048 --> 11:52.721
Not a great look.
No.

11:57.480 --> 11:59.892
Are any of you slave-nappers?

11:59.902 --> 12:02.519
Do you know anyone who wants to nap
a slave?

12:10.811 --> 12:13.849
Oi, mate! Do you fancy napping me,
by any chance?

12:15.185 --> 12:16.243
Oh.

12:23.167 --> 12:26.091
Oh! Come on.
Oh! Bingo!

12:30.994 --> 12:34.612
Mmm! This is lovely! I didn't have
you down as dinner party types.

12:34.745 --> 12:37.651
Us two? We are dinner party types.
We love a dinner party.

12:37.660 --> 12:41.290
This is our first one. Yes, but now
we've got someone who can cook,

12:41.291 --> 12:45.729
we'll have loads. Rabbit stew, with
carrots and petit pois.

12:45.737 --> 12:47.584
Thank you, Mushki.
Mm-mm!

12:47.585 --> 12:50.532
Sorry, did you say, "Rabbit"?
I did, madam.

12:50.533 --> 12:52.968
As in 'cute bunny rabbit'?

12:52.987 --> 12:56.309
Anything's cute if you put the word
'bunny' in front of it.

12:56.316 --> 12:59.510
Yeah, like a bunny chicken.
Or a bunny fish.

12:59.511 --> 13:02.776
I used to have a rabbit in Britain.
Well, I doubt it's him.

13:02.822 --> 13:05.314
This doesn't come from Britain,
does it, Mushki?

13:05.336 --> 13:07.489
This rabbit is local, sir.

13:07.490 --> 13:09.766
I killed and skinned it myself.

13:09.776 --> 13:11.858
The stock is made from the entrails.

13:13.243 --> 13:14.790
It's... cool.

13:14.809 --> 13:18.067
More wine, anyone?
No! No, sir.

13:18.068 --> 13:20.787
You've got me now.
OK.

13:22.576 --> 13:25.147
Do you guys have any tomato sauce?

13:26.919 --> 13:28.865
Tomato sauce, madam?

13:28.872 --> 13:32.172
Er, don't you want to try it first?
She puts it on everything.

13:32.187 --> 13:35.748
A stew is its own sauce, madam.

13:35.761 --> 13:40.119
I can go get some from our place if
you don't have any. No!

13:40.144 --> 13:43.728
I will grind you some myself using
fresh tomatoes.

13:47.354 --> 13:50.506
If it's no hassle.
No hassle... at all!

13:52.319 --> 13:54.959
OK, you're right, he is creepy.
Really creepy.

13:56.364 --> 13:57.263
Shh.

14:09.692 --> 14:11.569
Morning, sleepy socks.
Oh! Sh...

14:13.767 --> 14:16.156
Morning, Mushki.
Slept well last night, sir.

14:16.163 --> 14:18.557
Yeah, not bad.
No, I'm telling you you did.

14:18.558 --> 14:21.837
Must have been the Valerian tea - it
can really knock you out.

14:21.842 --> 14:23.913
Oh. What's that?
I'm shaving you, sir.

14:23.923 --> 14:26.415
No, I'd rather do that, please.
No need, sir.

14:26.442 --> 14:29.478
My grooming skills are somewhat
celebrated.

14:29.479 --> 14:32.528
It's been said my masters can be
identified

14:32.557 --> 14:35.390
by the smoothness of their cheeks
alone.

14:37.030 --> 14:38.327
Ah!

14:41.053 --> 14:44.034
You've had quite a lot of masters,
haven't you, Mushki?

14:44.035 --> 14:47.809
I have indeed. 16, including sir.

14:47.810 --> 14:49.812
Oh, yeah?

14:49.837 --> 14:53.375
Why so many, do you think?
Well, a range of reasons.

14:53.390 --> 14:56.876
Some wanted to travel, some needed
to economise,

14:56.877 --> 14:58.891
and some...
Ah.

15:00.358 --> 15:02.122
..were fucking scum.

15:03.679 --> 15:07.502
I'm very happy with you, though,
sir. Oh, great. Great.

15:09.027 --> 15:12.486
And the reason for returning him?
He's quite weird.

15:12.494 --> 15:16.669
Weird? OK, let me just check the
warranty.

15:16.670 --> 15:21.460
Erm, is he fulfilling the basic functions
of a slave - cooking, cleaning, etc?

15:21.472 --> 15:24.123
Well, yeah...
Yes, he's an amazing slave.

15:24.142 --> 15:27.288
Has he stolen from you, or a member
of your household? No.

15:27.289 --> 15:30.763
Has he sexually molested you, or a
member of your household? No.

15:30.774 --> 15:33.129
Not yet!
Has he poisoned you, or a member -

15:33.141 --> 15:35.860
Yeah! He poisoned me.
You don't look very poisoned.

15:35.878 --> 15:39.803
He gave me a large dose of Valerian
tea last night. Valerian tea?

15:39.821 --> 15:41.550
For pain relief?
Yeah.

15:41.570 --> 15:43.402
And how are you feeling today?

15:43.414 --> 15:45.152
A bit better, thanks.
Mm-hm.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.038
But I'm telling you, he's weird!

15:47.039 --> 15:50.826
Well, weird isn't covered here, so
you'll just have to keep the guy.

15:50.851 --> 15:53.240
Thank you, we intend to.
If you aren't happy,

15:53.249 --> 15:56.125
you could buy another one.
No, we can't afford that.

15:56.126 --> 15:59.694
We had a lovely new batch in this
morning. You're all right, thanks.

15:59.702 --> 16:01.852
Hang on. What?!

16:04.697 --> 16:05.801
Grumio?

16:05.810 --> 16:08.222
All right?
What happened here, then?

16:08.223 --> 16:11.259
Don't know. Must have been
slave-napped.

16:11.271 --> 16:14.206
Excuse me, this is my slave. He went
missing last night.

16:14.224 --> 16:18.127
Really? Are you this man's slave.
I don't think so.

16:18.137 --> 16:21.295
I've never done any actual work for
him, so how can I be?

16:21.296 --> 16:23.405
Very good. Can I have him out,
please?

16:23.409 --> 16:25.980
No. He doesn't know you.
Of course he does.

16:25.990 --> 16:28.721
I don't. He's a bloody chancer.
Don't be like that!

16:28.734 --> 16:32.568
We'll be auctioning the new batch at
sundown if you'd like to buy him.

16:32.569 --> 16:33.659
And what if I don't?

16:33.669 --> 16:36.695
I expect someone else will.
Yeah, someone who rates me.

16:36.702 --> 16:38.215
No-one will rate you, Grumio.

16:38.231 --> 16:41.499
People don't rate farty little men
who sleep during the day.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.946
Now, either tell the truth and come
with us,

16:43.961 --> 16:46.783
or stay in this cage picking your
nose. It's up to you.

16:48.258 --> 16:49.828
Oh' my...

16:56.235 --> 16:58.545
Yay! Happy birthday!

16:58.550 --> 17:04.262
So here's your present.
Oh, what a lovely surprise!

17:04.271 --> 17:06.343
It's from all of us.
Mainly me.

17:16.233 --> 17:17.416
What is this?

17:17.426 --> 17:19.065
It's a bread bin.

17:19.079 --> 17:21.367
I'm sorry?
A bread bin.

17:24.561 --> 17:26.598
I don't want that.
R-Right.

17:26.626 --> 17:30.085
Because we did find it hard to
choose a gift.

17:30.104 --> 17:33.938
You know, what do you get the woman
who has everything? Well, not that.

17:33.968 --> 17:37.336
Something else.
Yes.

17:38.845 --> 17:40.939
We'll get something else.

17:47.031 --> 17:50.877
We should get to the market. He won't
cost much! I'm not buying Grumio!

17:50.886 --> 17:54.686
Not when I already own him and we've
got a perfectly good slave at home.

17:54.697 --> 17:58.372
Mushki's a psycho, I promise you!
He's not a psycho, he's a softie!

17:58.384 --> 18:01.649
Look, he's painted our names on the
wall! In blood, probably.

18:01.662 --> 18:03.949
Welcome home, sirs. I've taken the
liberty

18:03.967 --> 18:07.360
of warming your slippers on the
stove. We don't have slippers.

18:07.361 --> 18:09.752
I've taken the liberty of
knitting you some.

18:09.759 --> 18:11.614
Thanks a lot.
You're welcome a lot.

18:11.632 --> 18:14.132
Well, in you come!

18:14.133 --> 18:18.354
What was that? That's just creaking
timbers, I imagine.

18:18.375 --> 18:21.197
Help!
They can be ever so creaky!

18:21.211 --> 18:23.498
Is that Cynthia?
It is. In we go, then!

18:23.509 --> 18:26.479
Why is she shouting?
Her gag must have slid off.

18:26.492 --> 18:27.766
Oh, right.

18:27.779 --> 18:29.827
Sorry, what the fuck?!

18:29.837 --> 18:31.726
You all right?

18:31.736 --> 18:34.683
Your crackpot slave's put us in
prison here.

18:34.684 --> 18:37.472
You didn't, did you?
I was upset after last night,

18:37.488 --> 18:40.435
so I went round to reason with them.
That makes sense.

18:40.446 --> 18:44.679
But they wouldn't see reason, so I bound
and gagged them. That makes less sense.

18:44.688 --> 18:47.329
Those evil witches are trying to
drive us apart!

18:47.330 --> 18:50.366
I heard what they said about me -
they think I'm creepy!

18:50.367 --> 18:52.469
No! I wonder why?!
He's a bloody loony!

18:52.481 --> 18:54.392
Shut up! Shut your dirty mouths!

18:54.399 --> 18:57.676
Just leave them. Leave them, sirs,
and they'll go away.

18:57.677 --> 19:01.190
Go away, as in die?
In time, yes.

19:01.191 --> 19:02.909
You don't need them, sir.

19:02.923 --> 19:06.144
You don't need anyone - you've got
me now. Where's the key?

19:06.145 --> 19:08.534
I swallowed it.
Right. When will it come out?

19:08.543 --> 19:10.989
With my metabolism, about 10:30
tomorrow.

19:11.003 --> 19:12.744
Hair grip!

19:12.763 --> 19:14.766
Right, yes. Use that!

19:14.767 --> 19:17.111
If you insist, sir.

19:20.078 --> 19:21.944
Fine, he is mad.
Just have to...

19:22.003 --> 19:23.562
And...

19:23.579 --> 19:26.439
Oh...
Untie me right now!

19:26.440 --> 19:29.077
Oh, shit! Is that blood?
No, it's tomato sauce.

19:29.078 --> 19:31.566
That maniac started chucking it at
us.

19:31.567 --> 19:33.717
Take Metella's gag off.

19:33.721 --> 19:35.940
Well, all in good time.
Right!

19:35.965 --> 19:39.401
Well, shall we go in then, sirs?
Tonight's dinner is lamb hotpot.

19:39.407 --> 19:41.580
Yeah, I think we'll eat out tonight.

19:41.599 --> 19:44.091
We need to see a man about... a man.
Right.

19:46.298 --> 19:48.881
Do I hear 120? Thank you, madam.

19:48.905 --> 19:51.294
120 - going once, going twice...

19:51.304 --> 19:54.365
Sold to the tall woman with the
short husband. Thank you.

19:54.372 --> 19:55.339
There he is.

19:55.343 --> 19:59.070
Next up, it's lot No.56.

19:59.071 --> 20:04.123
Hailing from a farm near Pisa, this
item goes by the name of Grumio.

20:04.126 --> 20:08.142
He's had just one careful owner.
Not careful enough, clearly.

20:08.143 --> 20:11.618
So, let's start the bidding at 50
denari.

20:11.646 --> 20:13.582
As if anyone will pay that!

20:13.583 --> 20:16.621
Yup! Thank you, sir - 50 I have.
Did someone just bid?

20:16.639 --> 20:18.368
Must be a mistake.
Do I hear 60?

20:18.398 --> 20:21.322
60, thank you. That's 60. 70 with
you, madam.

20:21.333 --> 20:24.075
What's going on?
Who will offer me 80? 80?

20:24.076 --> 20:25.712
Oh, for Jove's sake!

20:25.723 --> 20:28.772
80, thank you, sir. Do I hear 90?

20:28.792 --> 20:32.808
This versatile unit is extremely
compact for easy storage.

20:32.828 --> 20:34.592
Ha-ha!

20:34.612 --> 20:37.934
Grumio is a stylish accessory for
the man or woman about town.

20:37.941 --> 20:41.206
He's strutting! Stop strutting,
Grumio.

20:41.211 --> 20:44.169
Who'll give me 100? 100. 110?

20:44.190 --> 20:46.350
110.
Don't bid against me!

20:46.351 --> 20:48.001
Sorry.
120, anyone?

20:48.018 --> 20:53.008
Grumio can perform a variety of
functions - wine pourer, babysitter,

20:53.009 --> 20:56.388
dog walker! 130, anyone?

20:56.424 --> 21:00.099
130? Yes, 130! At 140, anyone?
Yes!

21:00.113 --> 21:02.400
140. 150? 150. 160?

21:02.417 --> 21:05.876
270 denari.
I'm gonna be sick.

21:05.876 --> 21:10.029
Our biggest sale of the day.
Well, it's nice to feel wanted.

21:10.052 --> 21:11.668
And I assume you'll be paying

21:11.678 --> 21:15.182
in bite-size monthly instalments
again? We'll pay the lump sum.

21:15.208 --> 21:18.121
Will we? How?
Well, you know - one in, one out.

21:20.002 --> 21:22.473
Now, I'm sorry, Mushki, but it's for
the best.

21:22.474 --> 21:26.195
Please let me stay. I can change.
You'll love your new mistress.

21:26.203 --> 21:29.070
She's kind, she's cultured.
Yeah!

21:29.081 --> 21:31.573
And we won't tell her you're a
fucking lunatic

21:31.585 --> 21:33.952
Oh, right. Thank you.

21:33.965 --> 21:35.239
Mm-mm!

21:35.254 --> 21:37.912
Come on then, mate, 17th time lucky.

21:37.913 --> 21:41.577
Was there no change from the 300?

21:41.601 --> 21:43.368
Er, sadly not.
Oh.

21:43.369 --> 21:45.543
Ta-da!

21:45.544 --> 21:48.691
Oh, yes! A man!

21:48.692 --> 21:51.111
That's more like it!

21:51.112 --> 21:54.406
He's a house slave. It was Stylax's
idea.

21:54.407 --> 21:57.356
Shredder, you shouldn't have.
No, no, I really should.

21:57.357 --> 22:00.816
My name is Mushki. I look forward to
sewing you in any way I can.

22:00.859 --> 22:02.657
Oh, he's terrific!

22:02.672 --> 22:05.642
Oh, he's lovely and pink!

22:05.665 --> 22:09.974
Now, who'd like some cake?
Oh, allow me, madam.

22:09.975 --> 22:12.933
Oh, thank you very much.
You're welcome very much.

22:17.443 --> 22:20.686
I'm sorry I doubted you, Grumio.
That guy was dearly insane.

22:20.701 --> 22:24.296
You're all right. I mean, what sort
of person shits in his own hat?

22:24.309 --> 22:25.617
No, that were me.

22:25.637 --> 22:28.277
Seriously?
Why did you do that?

22:28.279 --> 22:31.078
He were a twat, so I shat in his
hat.

22:31.111 --> 22:32.909
Fair enough.

22:32.918 --> 22:35.148
By the way, this food is genuinely
foul.

22:35.149 --> 22:37.176
Couldn't give a toss, mate.

22:39.996 --> 22:42.082
Ooh, cheese roll!

22:42.083 --> 22:44.085
Ow.

22:46.040 --> 22:48.964
I couldn't help noticing...
Oooh.

22:48.978 --> 22:52.022
...that madam didn't finish her
sorbet.

22:52.023 --> 22:55.869
Ah. Oooh, ahh!
