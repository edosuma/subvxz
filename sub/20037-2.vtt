00:01.133 --> 00:02.599
I offer you love.

00:02.600 --> 00:04.519
For a harlot, that doesn't exist.

00:04.520 --> 00:05.719
Here's tuppence.

00:05.720 --> 00:07.608
- What's that for?
- Company.

00:07.633 --> 00:09.192
Ma, there's your solution.

00:09.193 --> 00:11.872
- Sell her virginity.
- I'm worth at least 50 pounds, Ma.

00:11.873 --> 00:13.592
I can view tonight the players

00:13.593 --> 00:15.085
and I'll take sealed bids.

00:16.152 --> 00:18.032
You're clearly frigid, still a virgin.

00:18.033 --> 00:19.312
Don't tell my ma.

00:19.313 --> 00:20.872
One of your girls came to me today.

00:20.873 --> 00:23.352
Pert little doxie by
the name of Emily Lacey.

00:23.353 --> 00:25.673
Damn you for a kidnapping pimp!

01:08.793 --> 01:10.352
I was forced to sell her.

01:10.353 --> 01:11.992
I needed the hundred
pounds for our move.

01:11.993 --> 01:14.432
This has always been Lucy's future.

01:20.193 --> 01:21.912
She was rushed into it.

01:21.913 --> 01:23.599
That Lydia bitch Quigley.

01:23.624 --> 01:24.873
She's heard about my Greek Street House

01:24.896 --> 01:26.255
and she's trying to keep me down.

01:26.256 --> 01:29.926
It's a huge leap; A vast expense.

01:31.816 --> 01:33.695
We're down to two girls.

01:33.696 --> 01:35.803
This move is too much risk.

01:35.828 --> 01:39.027
Lydia Quigley has her girls
sucking the law, the clergy,

01:39.028 --> 01:41.264
and the whole King's bench!

01:44.009 --> 01:47.068
If she kicks me, I'll bite her back.

01:49.748 --> 01:51.107
So what brought you to London?

01:51.108 --> 01:52.587
I was in the navy.

01:52.588 --> 01:54.227
Might've known.

01:54.228 --> 01:55.827
Were you in the war?

01:55.828 --> 01:57.452
Tail end of it.

01:57.868 --> 02:00.107
In Guadeloupe, Havana.

02:00.108 --> 02:01.867
West Indies.

02:01.868 --> 02:03.867
What did you see?

02:03.868 --> 02:06.119
The inside of a ship, mostly.

02:06.868 --> 02:08.507
Green islands,

02:08.508 --> 02:10.509
land I never walked on,

02:10.988 --> 02:12.541
and fish.

02:13.068 --> 02:15.667
The fish were profoundly amazing.

02:15.668 --> 02:16.958
How?

02:18.108 --> 02:20.347
That's it, the hour's up now.

02:20.348 --> 02:22.827
You must pay for another
to hear about the fish.

02:22.828 --> 02:25.177
You're learning, Mr. Marney.

02:32.755 --> 02:34.707
You'll make a harlot of me yet.

02:34.708 --> 02:36.380
I'm not buying.

02:39.655 --> 02:42.106
Thank you for your company, Ms. Wells.

02:54.188 --> 02:56.987
Charlotte, before you say a word...

02:56.988 --> 02:58.827
it was an error!

02:58.828 --> 03:01.349
You're referring to my sister?

03:01.988 --> 03:04.271
Did you deflower her?

03:04.296 --> 03:05.732
Yes.

03:06.668 --> 03:08.387
And it wasn't an error until after?

03:08.388 --> 03:10.947
It was a direct result of your
behavior towards me yesterday!

03:10.948 --> 03:12.667
I'm going to pack, you
can order me a coach.

03:12.668 --> 03:14.907
Charlotte, it was nothing.

03:14.908 --> 03:17.267
I spent the whole time thinking of you!

03:17.268 --> 03:18.941
Please.

03:19.828 --> 03:21.980
I'm deranged with love.

03:22.005 --> 03:23.484
Don't leave me.

03:23.509 --> 03:26.230
I'd look a fool in
front of the whole town!!

03:27.708 --> 03:29.890
Is that what troubles you?

03:30.348 --> 03:33.347
I know I can't make you
love me but stay with me.

03:33.348 --> 03:34.547
You can have anything.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.507
I only ever asked for your trust.

03:36.508 --> 03:38.227
You have it, you have it.

03:38.228 --> 03:39.668
I trust you!

03:42.108 --> 03:43.454
Please.

03:44.948 --> 03:46.954
You've roused the serpent.

03:47.988 --> 03:50.837
The serpent has been bad,
I don't want to see him.

03:52.228 --> 03:54.107
He's a very sorry serpent.

03:54.108 --> 03:57.707
He wants to tell you so, in person.

03:57.708 --> 04:01.897
What will he give me,
to prove his contrition?

04:03.228 --> 04:05.707
A ring... of pearl and gold.

04:05.708 --> 04:07.667
Is he going to pay my gaming debts?

04:07.668 --> 04:09.668
Yes, all of them.

04:11.508 --> 04:13.347
Then he may have some fruit.

04:26.569 --> 04:27.867
George!

04:32.258 --> 04:33.777
Lydia Quigley.

04:36.428 --> 04:37.987
She could attack me again,

04:37.988 --> 04:40.382
that citadel of quim in Golden Square.

04:42.188 --> 04:44.747
Do you really want to kick that nest?

04:44.748 --> 04:46.067
You know?

04:46.092 --> 04:49.011
A host of wasps may rise to sting you.

04:51.108 --> 04:52.667
How old is that fish?

04:52.668 --> 04:54.507
It's turning my stomach.

04:54.508 --> 04:57.187
It ain't the fish making you sick.

04:57.188 --> 05:00.167
You were just like this when
you put Charlotte on the town.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.910
Lucy must have Repton.

05:04.455 --> 05:06.254
I sold her twice.

05:06.279 --> 05:07.747
Don't know how to tell her.

05:07.748 --> 05:09.527
Only twice?

05:15.628 --> 05:18.068
Shut up, Filth!

05:26.828 --> 05:29.681
Her renown might be her weakness.

05:29.706 --> 05:30.970
Quigley's?

05:30.995 --> 05:33.547
Well, you could attack her reputation.

05:33.548 --> 05:36.697
I could have a notion
that would hurt her custom.

05:38.548 --> 05:40.747
Do you remember Mary Cooper?

05:40.748 --> 05:43.307
She was a shining star at Quigley's.

05:50.068 --> 05:52.228
You snore like a piglet.

05:56.548 --> 05:58.818
I've got every right to snore.

05:58.843 --> 06:01.685
I was tupped in half last night.

06:03.428 --> 06:06.987
I'm on my way to
earning myself a fortune.

06:06.988 --> 06:08.947
You've got this to pay for first.

06:08.948 --> 06:10.564
Quigley puts it on your debt.

06:10.658 --> 06:12.283
_

06:12.308 --> 06:14.627
Your meals, your room.

06:14.628 --> 06:16.747
She takes it from your money.

06:16.748 --> 06:20.001
We think "Yes, I will get rich..."

06:20.026 --> 06:22.822
but Mrs. Quigley, only she gets rich.

06:28.548 --> 06:32.054
Count Heinrich was thrilled
with Miss Lacey last night.

06:33.548 --> 06:36.983
I think she'll earn
her body-weight in gold.

06:38.232 --> 06:39.671
I'm glad you're thinking.

06:39.696 --> 06:42.455
It's a good activity for you, my dear.

06:42.480 --> 06:45.382
I pray you'll indulge in it more often.

06:47.988 --> 06:50.747
- Justice Cunliffe.
- Mistress Lydia.

06:50.748 --> 06:53.507
I thought your only current
mistress was the law.

06:53.508 --> 06:55.987
I am in need of a girl.

06:56.012 --> 06:58.747
Ever the overkeen schoolboy.

06:58.748 --> 07:02.162
- Take one.
- Not that kind of a girl.

07:02.977 --> 07:04.856
I have some new friends.

07:04.881 --> 07:08.975
They're looking for
something more... immaculate.

07:09.948 --> 07:12.928
A sweet, untouched hanging risk?

07:14.108 --> 07:16.732
Why would I need that kind of peril?

07:17.873 --> 07:20.951
The peril is the adventure, surely.

07:22.628 --> 07:24.667
You mistake me for a gull.

07:24.668 --> 07:27.524
I have told my new friends
that you are unsurpassed.

07:27.549 --> 07:30.164
They will pay whatever you ask.

07:30.868 --> 07:32.586
Impress them.

07:33.108 --> 07:37.157
And doors would open for you,
as they are opening for me.

07:41.948 --> 07:44.475
What becomes of her after?

07:44.866 --> 07:47.067
I have no concern for after.

07:48.988 --> 07:51.741
Still a peach...

07:51.766 --> 07:54.507
under all that powder.

08:05.628 --> 08:07.793
Up, up!

08:07.818 --> 08:09.747
You got gainful employment.

08:09.748 --> 08:11.747
My cunny needs a cursed rest.

08:11.748 --> 08:13.747
I want feet, not cunny.

08:13.748 --> 08:15.867
- I want eyes.
- What for?

08:15.868 --> 08:18.401
You ever heard tell of Mary Cooper?

08:25.868 --> 08:29.206
I heard she'd fallen on hard times.

08:29.948 --> 08:31.596
You go find her.

08:41.534 --> 08:43.923
Your very first lover.

08:45.948 --> 08:47.532
How are you?

08:50.908 --> 08:52.465
It was nothing.

08:53.268 --> 08:54.787
Did we get enough?

08:54.788 --> 08:56.590
For the new house?

08:57.428 --> 08:58.965
We very...

08:59.865 --> 09:01.668
very nearly did.

09:04.668 --> 09:06.428
So we didn't?

09:07.292 --> 09:08.991
But fortunately,

09:09.016 --> 09:12.147
when the baronet made his bid for you,

09:12.172 --> 09:14.651
I had already accepted one.

09:14.676 --> 09:16.371
From Lord Repton.

09:20.948 --> 09:23.999
So that's twice for your maidenhead.

09:24.024 --> 09:27.067
- For you.
- Garters, we made them.

09:27.068 --> 09:28.772
To welcome you to the ranks.

09:29.394 --> 09:32.043
You always remember
your first time, Lucy.

10:12.268 --> 10:13.587
Well, you'll never know what
it means, to have a woman

10:13.588 --> 10:14.865
like Charlotte Wells.

10:14.890 --> 10:17.427
Such bliss is only for the chosen few.

10:17.428 --> 10:19.347
Well, here are some of
her promissory notes.

10:19.348 --> 10:20.881
Pay them.

10:24.908 --> 10:27.774
There's more than fifty pounds here!

10:28.668 --> 10:31.914
Yes, she's a very poor gambler.

10:31.948 --> 10:34.067
My lord, the chosen few...

10:34.068 --> 10:36.962
may not be as exclusive as you think.

10:37.548 --> 10:39.347
What do you mean?

10:39.348 --> 10:42.353
The Irishman who escorted her home...

10:43.188 --> 10:45.948
it wasn't exactly a kiss that I saw.

10:52.588 --> 10:54.722
Do you know God?

10:54.998 --> 10:57.693
Has He knocked upon your heart?

10:57.718 --> 11:01.077
And in the hour of your
beauty, did you turn Him away?

11:01.148 --> 11:03.379
You need Him now, don't you?

11:04.308 --> 11:06.471
Say a prayer for a poor harlot?

11:07.193 --> 11:09.952
Crime of impurity is
certainly deep down.

11:09.977 --> 11:11.256
Here.

11:11.281 --> 11:13.523
- Just ask yourself...
- You are loved.

11:13.548 --> 11:16.362
"How can I commit
this sin against God?"

11:19.317 --> 11:22.142
Any of you wretches know Mary Cooper?

11:23.068 --> 11:24.768
Mary Cooper?

11:25.588 --> 11:27.428
Who's Nathaniel Lennox?

11:29.708 --> 11:31.347
A friend.

11:31.348 --> 11:34.235
He went to America, must be 20 years.

11:34.454 --> 11:36.516
Asking for you in the tavern.

11:43.548 --> 11:45.068
Nat Lennox?

11:47.188 --> 11:48.719
So he's back?

11:50.828 --> 11:52.313
Must be down on his luck.

11:52.338 --> 11:55.467
He was telling the assembled
company of his fine plantation

11:55.468 --> 11:57.907
and his thousand slaves.

11:59.028 --> 12:00.067
Well...

12:00.068 --> 12:02.118
Strange you never mentioned him.

12:06.761 --> 12:09.886
I've been sitting here desponding, Will,

12:11.188 --> 12:13.769
thinking how we gonna find enough money?

12:14.948 --> 12:16.654
And sometimes,

12:16.679 --> 12:19.622
God just fills your glass, doesn't he?

12:25.428 --> 12:27.547
Here, look, it's Mary Cooper.

12:33.028 --> 12:34.130
Is she dead?

12:34.155 --> 12:36.427
- Touch her.
- You touch her.

12:48.028 --> 12:50.267
Excuse me, sir, I'm looking for work.

12:50.268 --> 12:52.307
This is the place, my dear.

12:52.308 --> 12:55.267
There's always housekeeper
looking for staff.

12:55.268 --> 12:56.307
Next!

13:04.627 --> 13:06.787
I'm here to find work.

13:06.788 --> 13:08.667
A housemaid perhaps.

13:08.668 --> 13:10.187
Forgive me.

13:12.268 --> 13:13.947
If you were not a stranger here,

13:13.948 --> 13:16.991
you would know that
woman is an infamous bawd.

13:18.544 --> 13:20.210
She would feast on your innocence

13:20.235 --> 13:22.834
and force you into a life of depravity.

13:22.859 --> 13:25.138
London is full of perils, my dear.

13:28.068 --> 13:31.547
I have a vacant position
for the right maid.

13:32.668 --> 13:34.427
I wonder...

13:34.428 --> 13:35.827
are you she?

13:38.188 --> 13:40.000
Perhaps you are!

13:58.886 --> 14:00.427
Is your master in?

14:02.028 --> 14:04.187
I am the mistress of this house.

14:05.948 --> 14:07.267
Must have the wrong door.

14:07.268 --> 14:09.915
I'm looking for Nathaniel Lennox.

14:10.175 --> 14:12.534
Mr. Lennox is my husband.

14:16.068 --> 14:17.587
Come sit down, come on.

14:17.588 --> 14:20.266
Mr. Lennox has often spoken of you.

14:20.828 --> 14:21.947
Really?

14:21.948 --> 14:24.027
Harriet knows all about us.

14:24.028 --> 14:26.153
I never thought I'd see you again.

14:28.298 --> 14:31.923
You are in trade, Mrs.
Wells, are you not?

14:31.948 --> 14:33.827
I have a boarding
house for young ladies.

14:33.828 --> 14:35.158
How admirable.

14:35.206 --> 14:37.579
- I have plans to expand.
- You always had plans.

14:37.604 --> 14:40.325
Got my eye on a fine
house in Greek Street.

14:40.326 --> 14:42.405
You might find it an
intriguing prospect.

14:42.406 --> 14:45.143
A business prospect.

14:45.406 --> 14:48.838
Maggie, I want to see you for pleasure.

14:52.166 --> 14:53.765
When might it please you?

14:53.766 --> 14:55.844
Maggie, stop that!

14:56.686 --> 14:58.664
Abigail, take them upstairs.

15:00.670 --> 15:02.770
Lovely children you have.

15:03.406 --> 15:06.141
I have a boy just like.

15:06.278 --> 15:08.645
Tomorrow I want you
to meet my eldest son.

15:08.646 --> 15:11.005
He's a bit...

15:11.006 --> 15:13.669
I think your house might suit him.

15:14.566 --> 15:17.364
You're welcome too, Mrs. Lennox.

15:18.083 --> 15:20.162
No, Harriet won't come.

15:20.163 --> 15:22.700
She knows me, don't you, my love?

15:23.163 --> 15:26.802
Mr. Lennox has educated
me extremely well.

15:32.083 --> 15:34.682
- Who have you left behind?
- Just my sister.

15:36.963 --> 15:38.442
No sweetheart?

15:38.443 --> 15:40.135
No.

15:40.443 --> 15:42.962
Because I'm most particular
about the kind of girls

15:42.963 --> 15:44.322
I employ.

15:44.323 --> 15:45.940
There's no one.

15:46.443 --> 15:48.682
I'm not like that.

15:48.683 --> 15:50.799
You're innocent, aren't you?

15:51.443 --> 15:54.802
Just as I was once myself.

15:56.963 --> 15:59.962
Now without further ado, I
shall go and get my gentlemen

15:59.963 --> 16:01.999
and they'll explain exactly

16:02.024 --> 16:04.177
how you are to be employed.

16:24.445 --> 16:25.844
Intact.

16:33.563 --> 16:36.073
I pledge my fidelity.

16:36.603 --> 16:39.363
I solemnly swear my loyalty to you.

16:40.963 --> 16:44.682
- Alas, I've some wearisome news.
- What is it?

16:44.683 --> 16:48.562
My Aunt Beatrice once
revealed her breasts to me

16:48.563 --> 16:51.082
while I was attempting
a Latin translation.

16:51.083 --> 16:53.083
They were like cow's tongues.

16:54.692 --> 16:56.042
She's dead.

16:56.043 --> 16:58.202
My mother commands my presence.

16:58.203 --> 17:00.082
You're leaving me, again?

17:00.083 --> 17:03.482
I must, in case the hag
has left me any coinage.

17:03.507 --> 17:04.949
Haxby will escort you while I'm gone.

17:04.973 --> 17:06.561
I've told him not to leave your side.

17:06.587 --> 17:08.535
I don't like Haxby.

17:08.803 --> 17:11.561
I won't tolerate that
servile prig spying on me.

17:11.563 --> 17:12.883
And I won't tolerate you slobbering

17:12.906 --> 17:15.426
over Irish louts on my doorstep!

17:19.292 --> 17:21.051
Follow her like a faithful dog,

17:21.077 --> 17:23.317
whether she wants it or no.

17:30.643 --> 17:33.697
So, you're my dog.

17:36.563 --> 17:38.322
Here boy.

17:38.323 --> 17:39.759
Here.

17:40.415 --> 17:41.739
Sit.

17:41.764 --> 17:45.047
Will I get a treat, Miss Wells?

17:46.083 --> 17:49.103
I don't think you're a
dog at all, Mr. Haxby.

17:49.764 --> 17:51.650
I think you're a bitch.

17:55.123 --> 17:58.082
Lord Fallon, Viscount Grayling.

17:58.083 --> 18:00.802
Between them, they own Berkshire.

18:00.803 --> 18:02.802
My mother delights in little secrets,

18:02.803 --> 18:05.562
so find out whatever you can.

18:10.083 --> 18:11.794
I say.

18:11.819 --> 18:13.375
It's French.

18:14.576 --> 18:17.001
And where are you from, Missy?

18:17.785 --> 18:19.774
The gutter.

18:20.563 --> 18:21.882
They've polished me up,

18:21.883 --> 18:25.641
but I'm still exceeding dirty.

18:36.080 --> 18:37.599
Let's see, get her up.

18:37.624 --> 18:39.498
Come up, Mary.

18:39.523 --> 18:41.360
Shining star, my ass.

18:43.083 --> 18:45.162
You're all right,
we'll get you in now.

18:52.002 --> 18:53.555
Come on, bring her in.

18:56.243 --> 18:57.562
Little gift for Mags.

18:57.563 --> 18:58.842
Mary Cooper.

18:58.843 --> 19:00.522
You are not bringing that in here.

19:00.523 --> 19:02.482
See what Quigley does to her girls?

19:02.483 --> 19:04.522
Got rid of her as soon as she got ill.

19:04.523 --> 19:06.842
It's the French Pox, Will.

19:06.843 --> 19:08.562
You'd have to fuck her to get it.

19:08.563 --> 19:10.079
Tuppence.

19:11.083 --> 19:13.602
- No good will come of this.
- God himself would approve.

19:13.603 --> 19:15.835
He may, but I don't.

19:18.843 --> 19:20.482
Help yourself, gentlemen.

19:20.483 --> 19:21.882
I'm going to eat your fruit.

19:21.883 --> 19:23.562
You look absolutely divine, my dear.

19:23.563 --> 19:24.882
Thank you.

19:26.563 --> 19:28.042
You are a delight.

19:36.535 --> 19:39.073
Sugar pigs!

19:40.403 --> 19:41.722
Mumma.

19:46.123 --> 19:48.082
Grayling is borrowing from Fallon.

19:50.043 --> 19:51.522
Who found it out?

19:51.523 --> 19:53.236
Emily Lacey.

19:53.843 --> 19:56.067
She's utterly bedazzling.

19:58.926 --> 20:00.925
So my beloved Emily has gone?

20:00.950 --> 20:03.079
Lydia Quigley's got her.

20:03.243 --> 20:04.842
That's terrible.

20:04.843 --> 20:06.842
How can I afford her in Golden Square?

20:06.843 --> 20:09.829
Your distress should go
beyond her price, Mr. Holland.

20:16.283 --> 20:19.080
This is what happens to Quigley's girls.

20:20.523 --> 20:22.362
"Mary Cooper spun straw into gold"

20:22.363 --> 20:25.565
"for a well known
widow of Golden Square."

20:27.563 --> 20:30.136
Say "kidnapping pimp," not "widow."

20:30.161 --> 20:31.522
And say "Lydia Quigley."

20:31.523 --> 20:33.331
I cannot name her directly.

20:35.323 --> 20:37.562
Well, then call her "Dame Death."

20:37.563 --> 20:40.322
But make it clear that
Mary caught the French Pox

20:40.323 --> 20:41.902
under her roof.

20:41.927 --> 20:43.446
Do we know that to be true?

20:43.471 --> 20:45.391
Use your arts!

20:47.368 --> 20:49.377
How hard is it to pay for washing?

20:54.883 --> 20:57.347
I'll be with you just now, handsome.

21:04.455 --> 21:05.894
We're so busy.

21:05.919 --> 21:07.334
Can't you help?

21:08.043 --> 21:09.562
Not allowed.

21:09.563 --> 21:12.608
I have to keep myself
pure for Lord Reptile.

21:13.003 --> 21:16.311
Your maidenhead's gone
on that baronet's maypole.

21:17.403 --> 21:19.363
What's pure about you now?

21:21.453 --> 21:23.172
Kitty!

21:23.197 --> 21:25.796
You said you always
remember your first time.

21:25.821 --> 21:27.437
What was yours?

21:28.323 --> 21:31.802
One of my father's...
friends saw I was alone

21:31.803 --> 21:34.210
and forced himself upon me.

21:35.563 --> 21:37.296
That's my memory.

21:47.083 --> 21:49.042
I didn't mean to antagonize you.

21:49.043 --> 21:50.282
There are so many ways

21:50.283 --> 21:52.562
in which you are a
stupid, stubborn woman.

21:52.563 --> 21:55.562
Will, Quigley must be stood up to!

21:55.563 --> 21:57.362
I must strike back!

21:57.363 --> 21:59.282
If we attack Lydia Quigley,

21:59.283 --> 22:02.722
she will retaliate with all
the power at her disposal!

22:06.243 --> 22:08.189
So think hard...

22:09.283 --> 22:12.027
before you make that
dying girl your weapon.

22:29.523 --> 22:32.136
"Infection was Mary's reward,"

22:32.161 --> 22:35.298
"for disease respects nor rich nor poor."

22:35.323 --> 22:37.922
"It lingers when the sport is done"

22:37.923 --> 22:41.144
"and may still hang
like a pestilent mist"

22:41.169 --> 22:44.562
"over the heartless madam's
pleasure house in Golden Square."

22:45.603 --> 22:47.842
"Ejected by this fiendish madam,"

22:47.843 --> 22:51.011
"who we can only call 'Dame Death, '."

22:51.036 --> 22:54.128
"Mary was taken in by M. W.,"

22:54.153 --> 22:56.282
"a kindly widow of Covent Garden,"

22:56.283 --> 22:58.979
"who is comforting her
in her final hours."

23:01.479 --> 23:03.682
Margaret Wells, ha!

23:03.753 --> 23:06.362
Blimey, Mrs. Wells took her in.

23:06.363 --> 23:07.842
- Well, I never!
- Miss Lacey.

23:07.843 --> 23:09.285
She didn't get the pox here, did she?

23:09.309 --> 23:10.354
I don't want it.

23:10.379 --> 23:12.842
When I want fatuous,
dull-witted commentary,

23:12.843 --> 23:14.482
I will buy a parrot.

23:19.363 --> 23:23.242
So you're using me in a
fight with Mrs. Quigley.

23:23.243 --> 23:25.082
No one uses me...

23:25.083 --> 23:26.922
unless they pay.

23:26.923 --> 23:28.444
I beg your pardon?

23:28.469 --> 23:30.322
You'd have died yesterday
if it weren't for me.

23:30.323 --> 23:32.350
I want more gin!

23:32.483 --> 23:34.162
- I want laudanum.
- Now listen...

23:34.163 --> 23:37.562
I want five pounds and
I want a roast chicken!

23:37.563 --> 23:39.362
- Do not make demands.
- Or I shall walk out

23:39.363 --> 23:41.028
on that street and tell all London

23:41.053 --> 23:43.207
how I love good Lydia Quigley.

23:44.373 --> 23:47.562
I wasn't even ill 'til I left her house.

23:47.563 --> 23:50.890
I caught this pox on Cheapside.

23:52.686 --> 23:54.593
Say nothing.

24:05.083 --> 24:06.763
Are you a virgin?

24:09.095 --> 24:10.705
Are you a harlot?

24:13.323 --> 24:15.922
They say you only
remember your first time.

24:17.163 --> 24:19.180
Would you like to remember me?

24:23.058 --> 24:24.722
You'll have to pay.

24:31.003 --> 24:33.009
I need it for food.

24:33.323 --> 24:34.842
What's your name?

24:34.843 --> 24:36.322
Jem Curran.

24:36.323 --> 24:38.103
Jem Curran.

24:38.643 --> 24:40.795
I am Lucy Wells.

24:41.123 --> 24:43.397
Famed courtesan.

24:43.923 --> 24:46.380
Give me your money and
I'll make you a man.

25:13.761 --> 25:17.116
What use is moaning?

25:17.141 --> 25:19.762
I've saved you from a life of drudgery.

25:19.763 --> 25:21.522
One day you'll be grateful.

25:21.523 --> 25:23.522
Look how much money the gentlemen paid,

25:23.523 --> 25:26.362
more than you'd earn in
a year as a housemaid.

25:26.363 --> 25:28.751
Enough whining!

25:28.776 --> 25:31.122
I'm having a dreadful day.

25:32.403 --> 25:34.542
Stop that noise!

25:36.542 --> 25:37.972
Now...

25:38.315 --> 25:40.978
this lady will take you
to your new place of work

25:41.003 --> 25:43.362
and give you a nice
room and a pretty dress.

25:43.363 --> 25:45.722
- Thirty!
- Twenty.

25:45.723 --> 25:48.737
Thirty, or may cancer strike you.

25:50.719 --> 25:54.922
"When I want fatuous and
dull-witted commentary,"

25:54.923 --> 25:57.344
"I simply talk to my son!"

25:57.843 --> 25:59.656
You insolent jade.

26:01.043 --> 26:03.722
Don't be vexed;

26:03.723 --> 26:06.879
We were just idling, for lack of custom.

26:07.883 --> 26:09.723
All of you, leave us.

26:12.083 --> 26:13.763
Now!

26:20.483 --> 26:23.482
I've been your champion
since you got here.

26:27.713 --> 26:29.742
I feel villainous.

26:31.163 --> 26:35.162
And I deserve every bit
of your righteous passion.

26:35.163 --> 26:37.802
Yes!

26:37.803 --> 26:40.282
Mr. Quiggy!

26:40.283 --> 26:41.642
You're my man!

26:41.643 --> 26:42.922
Yes!

26:42.923 --> 26:45.002
Mr. Quiggy!

26:55.563 --> 26:56.602
Mumma!

26:56.603 --> 26:58.522
Chariots of hell.

27:03.312 --> 27:05.312
There's no custom, Mumma.

27:07.944 --> 27:11.313
The Prussian Embassy sent a card.

27:11.579 --> 27:13.002
They're not coming.

27:15.323 --> 27:17.343
What are you smiling about, Missy?

27:24.293 --> 27:27.383
Ooh, mind your pockets!

27:29.483 --> 27:31.802
Where does this filthy labyrinth lead?

27:34.705 --> 27:36.802
To my sister, Mr. Haxby.

27:36.803 --> 27:38.163
This is my home.

27:40.123 --> 27:41.891
Hello, sprat.

27:41.916 --> 27:43.498
I've come to see how you are.

27:43.523 --> 27:44.602
Not a sprat any more.

27:44.603 --> 27:46.242
Charlotte!

27:46.243 --> 27:48.642
- Where have you been; Get in!
- How are you, Pa?

27:48.643 --> 27:50.522
Where's Sir George?

27:50.523 --> 27:54.060
This is Mr. Haxby, his spy.

27:54.187 --> 27:56.706
We'll have no spying here, sir.

27:56.911 --> 27:59.074
This is a decent cunny house.

28:02.403 --> 28:04.082
We must impress this client.

28:04.083 --> 28:05.602
He's on his way.

28:05.603 --> 28:08.562
Betsey, Violet, no mere pintle-grabbing;

28:08.563 --> 28:10.242
You're not on the streets now.

28:10.243 --> 28:13.882
When we get in there,
everyone witty and reclining.

28:14.523 --> 28:18.322
Where's my cursed laudanum,
you cunny-licking witch?

28:18.323 --> 28:20.002
- I want my poppy!
- I beg you,

28:20.003 --> 28:22.722
take your spy in there and
keep this trollop quiet.

28:22.723 --> 28:23.882
Get her our of sight.

28:23.883 --> 28:25.725
Mary, remember me?

28:25.750 --> 28:28.402
Charlotte, what
does a whore have to do

28:28.403 --> 28:31.245
to get some poppy in this dump?

28:36.243 --> 28:37.886
Mary?

28:40.469 --> 28:42.468
You've had some adventures
since I last saw you.

28:42.493 --> 28:44.642
You mean I look like a bunter?

28:47.403 --> 28:49.562
Mr. Haxby, this is Mary.

28:49.563 --> 28:51.002
She was my friend.

28:51.003 --> 28:53.721
You got any poppy, mister?

28:53.843 --> 28:55.331
No.

28:55.603 --> 28:57.402
Are you Charlotte's cull?

28:57.403 --> 28:59.699
No, he's just a little drudge.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.894
Tupping his overlord.

29:02.083 --> 29:05.322
- So what's that like?
- I've known it worse.

29:05.323 --> 29:08.522
Well, I haven't; I can't
get a cockless leper.

29:18.489 --> 29:20.322
Welcome to the sanctuary.

29:20.323 --> 29:21.842
Leave your worries and
woes on the threshold

29:21.843 --> 29:23.642
and enter our house of recreation.

29:23.643 --> 29:26.523
I like that.

29:43.323 --> 29:45.402
This must be why you have sent for me.

29:45.427 --> 29:46.799
My daughter read it to me

29:46.824 --> 29:49.502
and I presume you're feeling libeled.

29:49.643 --> 29:52.345
Never presume to know how I'm feeling.

29:52.843 --> 29:55.173
God has made me a vessel for truth,

29:55.198 --> 29:57.259
and I must speak it.

29:58.229 --> 30:01.298
You live in my property rent-free!

30:01.323 --> 30:04.080
I am your God now, Mrs. Scanwell,

30:04.105 --> 30:07.330
and you will speak your truth for me!

30:07.603 --> 30:11.268
I have taken your house for
the sake of my daughter...

30:12.236 --> 30:14.556
and I will do your bidding...

30:15.763 --> 30:18.522
but you will always
hear God's truth from me.

30:18.523 --> 30:20.522
You're a scorpion, Mrs. Scanwell;

30:20.523 --> 30:22.122
That's the only truth that matters,

30:22.123 --> 30:24.988
and I've asked you to
sting Margaret Wells.

30:25.723 --> 30:27.402
Such things take time.

30:27.403 --> 30:29.816
The time is today.

30:32.083 --> 30:34.282
You can find your own way out.

30:38.843 --> 30:40.922
Can this really be the place?

30:40.923 --> 30:42.420
It's a common cathouse.

30:42.445 --> 30:43.653
When I was your age...

30:43.678 --> 30:45.349
That's the only one worth taking.

30:46.403 --> 30:47.642
I'll have her.

30:50.043 --> 30:52.310
That is my very own daughter, Lucy.

30:52.335 --> 30:54.639
And she's currently promised to another.

30:54.838 --> 30:56.959
But here is Miss Fletcher.

30:56.984 --> 30:59.762
She is very similar of age and demeanor.

30:59.763 --> 31:01.042
I'm also available.

31:01.043 --> 31:02.762
Get in there, Fanny!

31:06.857 --> 31:08.816
Forgive my modesty.

31:08.841 --> 31:11.717
I was a virgin until yesterday.

31:12.437 --> 31:14.956
The girl smells of stale liquor.

31:14.981 --> 31:16.646
The black's your choice, isn't she?

31:16.671 --> 31:17.702
What did you say?

31:17.727 --> 31:20.122
Have they all got manners
as foul as yours in America?

31:20.123 --> 31:21.842
Don't be offended.

31:21.843 --> 31:24.882
My father's always favored
a savage kind of whore.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.562
One more word and I will
send you out of this room

31:26.563 --> 31:27.998
like the child you are!

31:28.023 --> 31:31.462
I've a little sister who'll
grow up just like you.

31:31.622 --> 31:33.576
Get out, Benjamin.

31:34.323 --> 31:35.600
Out!

31:43.971 --> 31:45.642
Boy gives me indigestion.

31:47.843 --> 31:49.322
I like your house, Maggie.

31:51.043 --> 31:53.842
Your girls are cut from your cloth.

31:53.843 --> 31:58.002
Imagine how well we'd do,
if we had a bit of silk?

32:02.003 --> 32:04.596
You should take one of them upstairs.

32:04.621 --> 32:06.460
Miss Carter would suit you,

32:06.485 --> 32:08.164
she's an angel.

32:08.189 --> 32:10.002
Maggie, it isn't Miss
Carter or Miss Anyone-else

32:10.003 --> 32:12.033
I've come here to see.

32:12.536 --> 32:14.838
Surely you know that.

32:15.763 --> 32:17.352
It's you.

32:29.403 --> 32:31.030
He wants me.

32:32.403 --> 32:34.014
Fuck.

32:40.083 --> 32:43.042
I haven't been with
another man since 1758.

32:45.483 --> 32:47.562
Have you come to ask me if I mind?

32:53.883 --> 32:55.482
Give it back, you fuckin' weasel!

32:55.483 --> 32:56.700
I'll punch you...

33:04.483 --> 33:06.562
How goes the play, my lord?

33:08.323 --> 33:09.671
Badly.

33:16.590 --> 33:19.058
Emily Lacey is, at this moment,

33:19.083 --> 33:21.082
playing with her perfect breasts

33:21.083 --> 33:23.842
waiting to be skewered
on your pointed weapon.

33:23.843 --> 33:27.013
The Ledger says there's a
French Pox in your house.

33:28.563 --> 33:30.880
That's a lying rag; Our girls are clean.

33:30.905 --> 33:32.013
I swear, Quigley,

33:32.038 --> 33:33.602
if I pick up anything
from one of your whores,

33:33.603 --> 33:36.107
I'll choke you on a mercury cure.

33:41.533 --> 33:43.816
Time's done its work on me.

33:46.043 --> 33:47.574
On us both.

33:52.363 --> 33:55.011
I was so in love with you, Maggie.

33:55.339 --> 33:56.894
Tell me...

33:57.123 --> 33:58.760
was it only my money?

34:00.923 --> 34:03.082
When you went away...

34:03.083 --> 34:04.922
I was inconsolable.

34:11.947 --> 34:14.322
This whore is condemned by God.

34:14.322 --> 34:16.400
Her sins are dragging her down.

34:16.426 --> 34:18.202
How can you speak so brutally?

34:18.203 --> 34:19.522
I speak true.

34:19.523 --> 34:21.362
All harlots are damned.

34:21.362 --> 34:23.882
You're right, Mary, he is the devil.

34:35.043 --> 34:36.922
So how much you gonna lend me then,

34:36.922 --> 34:38.603
for my new house?

34:40.643 --> 34:44.282
- Don't let him take me!
- Mary Cooper, fuck off!

35:04.445 --> 35:07.006
This lady's been waiting to see you.

35:11.443 --> 35:14.202
I trust there is no
trouble with our business.

35:14.203 --> 35:15.453
None.

35:15.478 --> 35:18.162
Then what in the name of
all sense brings you here?

35:18.163 --> 35:22.550
A vile attempt... to blacken my name.

35:24.123 --> 35:26.962
I fail to see how this concerns me.

35:26.963 --> 35:29.042
Margaret Wells is behind it.

35:29.043 --> 35:31.522
You could have had her
whipped and transported

35:31.523 --> 35:33.763
but you left her at liberty.

35:38.403 --> 35:41.642
Justice cannot stoop
to a pointless vendetta

35:41.643 --> 35:43.322
between two bawds.

35:43.323 --> 35:45.242
What exactly did justice stoop to

35:45.243 --> 35:47.442
when it asked me to
kidnap an innocent girl?

35:47.443 --> 35:49.602
This is a trifling matter, madam.

35:49.603 --> 35:51.523
Take your scandal sheet and go.

35:59.643 --> 36:01.186
Forgive me.

36:03.014 --> 36:06.842
I do not have the superior
force of male reason

36:06.843 --> 36:08.904
willing my actions.

36:08.929 --> 36:12.283
As you and your powerful friends do.

36:27.674 --> 36:31.282
O God of Spirits and of all flesh...

36:32.037 --> 36:35.476
who hast trodden down death
and overcome the evil one...

36:35.501 --> 36:37.818
You had the trick of making
everyone look your way.

36:37.843 --> 36:42.431
Take, O Lord, the soul
of this sinner, Mary.

36:42.843 --> 36:45.322
'Tis within the power of your grace

36:45.323 --> 36:47.759
- to save her from perdition...
- You can stop now.

36:50.712 --> 36:52.142
She's dead.

37:09.214 --> 37:10.613
What do you want?

37:10.638 --> 37:14.023
Tell Dame Death Mary Cooper's dead.

37:14.609 --> 37:15.688
Get out.

37:15.713 --> 37:17.719
Tell her not to show
her face in Covent Garden

37:17.744 --> 37:20.695
'cause there's a lot of girls
who want to rip her eyes out.

37:24.893 --> 37:27.732
What is it between Mrs.
Wells and your mumma?

37:29.523 --> 37:31.029
I'm very busy.

37:32.963 --> 37:34.546
How?

37:34.571 --> 37:37.330
Seein' as we've got no culls.

37:39.163 --> 37:41.362
Tell me the tale of Mrs. Wells.

37:41.363 --> 37:43.390
It's none of your business.

37:44.523 --> 37:46.382
You don't know it, do you?

38:00.946 --> 38:02.872
We should put some powder on her.

38:04.163 --> 38:06.202
Let's not hide what life did to her.

38:07.843 --> 38:11.161
God preserve us all from
a fate like Mary Cooper's.

38:27.283 --> 38:29.762
Narrow is the path we tread

38:29.763 --> 38:31.863
and grave are the dangers.

38:31.888 --> 38:34.287
Mary Cooper reminds us of how brief

38:34.323 --> 38:36.803
our dance in the candlelight can be.

38:38.764 --> 38:41.363
The Lord has punished her sins!

38:41.443 --> 38:43.882
May He punish those
who sinned against her!

38:43.883 --> 38:46.418
- May He punish Dame Death!
- Yes!

38:46.443 --> 38:48.543
Margaret Wells.

38:49.203 --> 38:50.738
Whoremaker!

38:51.803 --> 38:53.402
Girlseller!

38:53.403 --> 38:55.457
Childspoiler!

38:55.987 --> 38:59.480
The annihilating angel
is coming for you.

38:59.505 --> 39:01.308
You're damned.

39:01.723 --> 39:04.522
As surely as the husk of depravity

39:04.523 --> 39:06.449
you carry to her tomb.

39:06.474 --> 39:09.882
Mary Cooper lit up
this town like a flare!

39:09.883 --> 39:12.894
- Yeah!
- And for those who damn us,

39:13.066 --> 39:15.842
us, I say be damned!

39:15.843 --> 39:17.162
Mary Cooper!

39:17.163 --> 39:18.882
Mary Cooper!

39:18.883 --> 39:20.522
Mary Cooper!

39:45.163 --> 39:46.772
Mary Cooper...

39:49.591 --> 39:51.231
Mary Cooper.

40:27.123 --> 40:29.664
My first harlot's coins, Mary.

40:39.312 --> 40:41.002
My pleasure, ladies.

40:51.182 --> 40:54.701
I looked down into the
waters and saw fish...

40:54.843 --> 40:56.802
so bright they hurt my eyes.

40:58.923 --> 41:01.482
Little jewels, some
smaller than minnows,

41:01.483 --> 41:03.286
some bigger than pigs.

41:05.963 --> 41:08.482
It was another world down there,

41:08.483 --> 41:12.239
a green and blue Eden.

41:14.547 --> 41:17.483
This life is full of
wonder, Charlotte Wells.

41:48.203 --> 41:50.952
Feel the scourge of remorse.

41:51.086 --> 41:54.295
Abase yourself at God's feet.

41:54.763 --> 41:58.042
Implore him for
forgiveness and in His mercy.

41:58.043 --> 42:01.162
He may save your filthy soul.

42:02.843 --> 42:04.722
Come on, Bets, stop your acting.

42:10.204 --> 42:12.718
Hatred, strife,

42:12.743 --> 42:14.481
murders, and drunkenness

42:14.483 --> 42:16.722
will follow you, every day of your life!

42:16.723 --> 42:18.602
- I love you too.
- Shame on you!

42:18.603 --> 42:20.905
God have mercy on you.

42:21.963 --> 42:24.162
Once a bobtail, always a bobtail!

42:59.550 --> 43:02.831
I thought I could walk
away this afternoon but...

43:02.960 --> 43:04.578
I can't.

43:06.763 --> 43:09.842
I always knew you
were grasping my money.

43:09.843 --> 43:11.354
Nat.

43:12.057 --> 43:14.522
You want me to invest in your house?

43:14.523 --> 43:16.151
Then I shall.

43:16.963 --> 43:20.236
Come and see me tomorrow
afternoon and we'll talk.

43:25.803 --> 43:28.432
Show me what you've got and
I'll show you what I've got.

43:28.457 --> 43:30.103
How's that for you?

43:44.323 --> 43:45.722
Violet tells me there's not a soul

43:45.723 --> 43:47.695
in Quigley's house tonight.

43:48.323 --> 43:50.037
Place is like a morgue.

44:09.403 --> 44:12.039
Give the man money, Mr. Haxby.

44:12.064 --> 44:14.223
A coin for a gentleman!

44:14.248 --> 44:15.945
I will not.

44:16.363 --> 44:18.266
Come on then, show
us what you've got.

44:18.291 --> 44:20.162
What's in your britches?

44:20.163 --> 44:22.875
Nothing but the Book of Common Prayer.

44:22.900 --> 44:24.842
You are shamefully drunk!

44:42.265 --> 44:44.784
Your hat, Mr. Haxby.

45:02.443 --> 45:05.122
She was a proper fucking minx, that one.

45:05.123 --> 45:07.581
May the pox strike her down.

45:12.803 --> 45:15.842
I once made the mistake
of treating Margaret Wells

45:15.843 --> 45:17.651
like my own.

45:18.523 --> 45:20.534
I took her into my home.

45:20.559 --> 45:22.495
She betrayed me.

45:22.750 --> 45:26.683
Had me arrested on a
vindictive charge; Kidnapping.

45:27.123 --> 45:28.722
I could have hanged.

45:31.123 --> 45:34.119
That woman is pure menace.

45:42.643 --> 45:44.282
Calling at this hour.

45:52.283 --> 45:53.962
Out of my way!
