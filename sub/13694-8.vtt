All right, Jess.

15:15.209 --> 15:17.378
I don't think
we've been introduced.

15:17.462 --> 15:19.005
I'm Hermione.

15:19.088 --> 15:21.132
Um, I know. Jess.

15:22.425 --> 15:24.635
You'll no doubt have heard
Duncan mention me.

15:24.719 --> 15:27.180
Yes. He has.

15:27.263 --> 15:30.683
I expect he'll be talking
about me even more now...

15:30.767 --> 15:33.728
As we're back together.

15:35.772 --> 15:37.732
-Sorry?
-I know.

15:37.815 --> 15:42.278
I was surprised myself,
but we've managed to
put our problems behind us.

15:42.362 --> 15:46.240
-When did this happen?
-Just now. Didn't he tell you?

15:46.324 --> 15:49.369
Hmm. Perhaps, he doesn't
want to go public just yet.

15:49.452 --> 15:52.330
I'll ask him when he comes
round for lunch tomorrow.

16:02.548 --> 16:04.550
Duncan. Golly.

16:04.634 --> 16:05.843
Yes! Yes!

16:07.136 --> 16:08.262
I made it.

16:08.346 --> 16:10.765
ANDREW: Well, this is
a pleasant surprise.

16:13.142 --> 16:14.977
Well, that's a matter
of opinion.

16:16.729 --> 16:18.606
I've been trying to call you.

16:18.690 --> 16:20.233
Andrew, why?

16:23.820 --> 16:27.365
-Maybe if we could find
somewhere more private.
-Whatever for?

16:27.448 --> 16:30.493
Molly, please.
I know you're angry,
but if we could just talk.

16:30.576 --> 16:32.912
We have nothing
whatsoever to talk about.

16:34.288 --> 16:36.833
You know, it's over.

16:36.916 --> 16:41.129
Now, please,
if you'll excuse me
I... I was just leaving.

16:41.838 --> 16:43.172
ANDREW: Molly?

16:45.008 --> 16:48.136
-Molly?
-I warned you not to hurt her.

16:50.596 --> 16:52.473
LEXIE: Come on, Golly.
Molly needs us.

17:05.778 --> 17:06.863
MOLLY: Oh!

17:06.945 --> 17:09.906
-PAUL: So how was it?
-Fine.

17:12.035 --> 17:13.578
Don't ask.

17:13.661 --> 17:15.038
What, so this is
your clearing up?

17:26.924 --> 17:29.969
-Morning.
-What are you doing
at lunchtime?

17:30.053 --> 17:31.512
Uh, nothing much.

17:31.596 --> 17:33.598
Good, I thought that we'd...

17:33.681 --> 17:36.934
Yeah, when I say nothing much,
I mean, I've got to pick up
a couple of things...

17:38.061 --> 17:39.145
From the village.

17:39.228 --> 17:41.689
Can't you do
that another time?

17:41.773 --> 17:44.192
No. It's got to be today.

17:44.275 --> 17:46.109
I'm free this evening, though.

17:46.194 --> 17:47.694
Sorry, I'm washing my hair.

18:10.927 --> 18:12.970
-Okay, Golly?
-Great.

18:24.857 --> 18:26.651
-Okay?
-Okay.

-Oh!

One, two, three.

If Dorothy wants
to play dirty,
then so can we.

19:04.897 --> 19:06.524
That looks like
an exciting job.

19:06.607 --> 19:08.693
(GRUNTING)
Tell me about it.

19:08.776 --> 19:10.153
It'd be easier with two.

19:10.236 --> 19:13.114
-Are you offering?
-Yeah, maybe.

19:13.197 --> 19:15.116
And what's the catch?

19:15.199 --> 19:19.662
Thing is, I'm not
getting on too well
with this cleaning thing.

19:19.746 --> 19:22.832
Right, so if I help you,
you'll help me?

19:23.291 --> 19:24.292
Huh.

19:25.168 --> 19:26.961
-Go on then.
-Great.

19:27.045 --> 19:28.838
Oh, one more thing.

19:28.921 --> 19:34.552
There's... There's no need
to say anything about this
to anybody.

19:34.635 --> 19:37.180
Do you not want Lexie
thinking you can't cope?

19:37.263 --> 19:38.848
Yeah, something like that.

19:38.931 --> 19:40.600
Then it's our secret.

19:41.434 --> 19:43.811
-I'll get my gear.
-Okay.

19:50.068 --> 19:52.570
-What are you smiling at?
-Nothing.

20:04.248 --> 20:07.710
Right, everybody.
The tiger yawns and...

20:21.557 --> 20:25.478
So, how does it feel
being the local heart-throb,
eh?

20:26.729 --> 20:27.980
What's that supposed to mean?

20:28.064 --> 20:30.024
All these girls
taking a shine to you.

20:30.108 --> 20:31.484
Oh, yeah. Like who?

20:31.567 --> 20:34.529
Like your little friend
from the distillery.

20:34.612 --> 20:36.072
Amanda?

20:37.198 --> 20:38.783
Well, that's early days yet.

20:39.742 --> 20:41.828
Anyway, that's only one.

20:41.911 --> 20:44.872
Well, maybe there's someone
a bit closer to home.

20:47.417 --> 20:50.378
You are such a typical man.

20:50.461 --> 20:52.296
You have no idea, do you?

20:53.423 --> 20:55.800
-So tell me.
-Jess.

20:56.759 --> 20:57.969
Oh, behave yourself.

20:58.052 --> 20:59.762
I am being serious here.

20:59.846 --> 21:01.222
So where did you
get this from?

21:02.473 --> 21:04.058
Just call it female intuition.

21:04.142 --> 21:06.561
Yeah, well,
you've got it wrong.

21:06.644 --> 21:08.688
Oh, she's a pretty girl.

21:08.771 --> 21:11.190
Yeah, but not my type.

21:11.983 --> 21:13.818
And Golly's daughter.

21:15.570 --> 21:17.280
I suppose that could
be a bit awkward.

21:19.240 --> 21:21.117
Maybe I should
have a word with her.

21:21.200 --> 21:23.494
Yeah, maybe you should.

21:28.583 --> 21:32.086
-I hope you saved me
something. I'm starving.
-There you go.

21:32.837 --> 21:34.589
Oh! Great.

-Is that it?
-Of course not.

21:49.395 --> 21:50.938
You and Jess are mates, right?

21:52.357 --> 21:54.275
-Aye.
-Has she...

21:56.194 --> 21:59.238
Has she said anything
to you about me?

21:59.322 --> 22:02.867
-Like what?
-Well, like she's got...

22:02.950 --> 22:06.204
You know, a thing about me.

22:06.287 --> 22:09.332
She has? Yeah, apparently.

22:09.415 --> 22:11.376
Have you noticed anything
different about her?

22:12.585 --> 22:13.670
I suppose so.

32:30.870 --> 32:33.164
Dorothy! Be careful.

32:33.247 --> 32:35.541
Dorothy! It's an old boat.

32:35.625 --> 32:38.920
MOLLY: It's an old canoe.
Be careful!

32:47.053 --> 32:48.054
(SCREAMING)

32:50.264 --> 32:54.102
So, Jess, we've...
We've never really talked,
have we?

32:54.185 --> 32:56.354
-You and me?
-We talk every day.

32:56.437 --> 33:01.401
No, I mean, talk properly
about...life and stuff.

33:01.484 --> 33:04.737
Okay. What do you want to say?

33:04.821 --> 33:09.200
Well... I hear you used
to go out with your
university lecturer.

33:09.283 --> 33:13.037
-Is that true?
-Yeah. Never again though.

33:13.121 --> 33:14.706
Age gap too much, was it?

33:14.789 --> 33:16.874
No, no, no.
I prefer older men.

33:16.958 --> 33:19.043
I've just given up
on academics.

33:19.127 --> 33:21.379
I'm more into
the outdoor type now.

33:23.756 --> 33:25.591
Why do you ask, anyway?

33:25.675 --> 33:30.555
No, it's just, it must
have been difficult,
that's all you know.

33:30.638 --> 33:32.181
Relationships between
work colleagues.

33:32.265 --> 33:34.017
I mean,
how often are they successful?

33:34.100 --> 33:38.146
True. But you never really
find out unless you try.

33:42.650 --> 33:44.235
(TOOTING HORN)

33:58.249 --> 33:59.834
(VAN HONKING)

34:10.011 --> 34:11.679
ANDREW: Duncan!

34:11.763 --> 34:13.097
What the hell
are you playing at?

34:13.181 --> 34:15.766
-DUNCAN: Sorry.
-Sorry?

34:15.850 --> 34:18.436
-Are you all right?
-Well, I'm alive, you psycho.

34:18.518 --> 34:19.853
I'll get a rope.

34:25.777 --> 34:27.695
Ugh.

34:27.779 --> 34:30.614
Look,
I'm sorry it's not Gucci.

34:30.697 --> 34:33.201
It's the best we can do.

34:33.284 --> 34:36.245
Blasted midges.
Driving me to distraction.

34:36.329 --> 34:40.833
Testing, testing.
One, two, three, four.
Testing. Help!

34:40.917 --> 34:43.628
LEXIE: Molly,
I think the battery's flat.

34:43.710 --> 34:47.340
I'm sorry, but I'll need
to sit down for a bit.

34:47.422 --> 34:51.135
We could be in trouble here.
I'm not happy about
his wound at all.

34:51.219 --> 34:55.014
We could be here for hours,
days, before anyone even
notices we're missing.

34:55.098 --> 34:59.310
Right, well, the least we can
do is start to build a fire.

34:59.394 --> 35:01.145
I'll go and get some wood.
Come on, Dorothy you as well.

35:01.229 --> 35:02.563
I beg your pardon?

35:02.647 --> 35:05.066
If you jump about, Dorothy,
you'll keep warm.

35:08.152 --> 35:10.697
Hello! Come on.
What are you waiting for?

35:15.868 --> 35:16.953
(SIGHING)

35:17.036 --> 35:18.329
Thanks.

35:18.413 --> 35:21.749
No, thank you.
It would have taken me
ages on my own.

35:21.833 --> 35:23.418
You can't be good
at everything, Paul.

35:23.501 --> 35:25.628
No. That's right.
Friends say
I'm terrible at relationships.

35:25.712 --> 35:29.841
Never had any luck at all.
In fact, I pity the next woman
that gets involved with me.

35:30.925 --> 35:33.928
Right. Do I need to know this?

35:34.012 --> 35:35.471
I think you do. Yes.

35:37.640 --> 35:38.725
Why?

35:39.559 --> 35:40.893
Well, because of...

35:42.645 --> 35:43.938
Because of the way you feel.

35:46.231 --> 35:48.735
I've got absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

35:48.817 --> 35:51.362
Please, this is embarrassing
enough as it is.

35:51.445 --> 35:53.614
-Don't make me say it.
-Say what?

35:54.282 --> 35:56.242
You fancy me.

35:56.325 --> 35:58.619
-Look, I'm very flattered...
-But...

35:58.702 --> 36:01.288
-I don't.
-Look, let's just be
adult about this.

36:01.371 --> 36:04.667
Paul! I don't think
of you like that at all.

36:07.044 --> 36:08.670
-Really?
-Really.

36:10.672 --> 36:12.592
-(SIGHING WITH RELIEF)
Oh, thank God for that.
-Thanks!

36:12.675 --> 36:15.094
No, I'm not saying that.
It's just that I'm...

36:18.097 --> 36:19.474
Not interrupting anything,
am I?

36:19.556 --> 36:20.558
-No.
-No.

36:22.810 --> 36:24.687
Paul, where's the tow rope?

36:24.771 --> 36:26.647
It's in the shed.

36:26.731 --> 36:28.649
Why? What have you done
with the Land Rover?

36:28.733 --> 36:30.818
(SIGHS)

36:30.902 --> 36:33.946
So much for
a bit of peace and quiet, eh?

36:34.030 --> 36:36.491
Well, I just wanted
to get away, you know.

36:37.784 --> 36:39.577
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

36:40.661 --> 36:42.330
You were right all along.

36:42.413 --> 36:43.748
I wish I hadn't been.

36:45.083 --> 36:47.752
I should have listened to you.

36:47.835 --> 36:51.297
Well, it won't happen again.
I'd rather be on my own.

36:51.381 --> 36:55.468
Molly, how many times
have I told you?
You've got years left.

36:55.551 --> 36:57.762
If you waste them because
of what's happened,

36:57.845 --> 37:00.973
then he really has
stolen something from you.

37:02.100 --> 37:03.851
You're a good friend, Golly.

37:03.935 --> 37:05.520
Where would I be without you?

37:05.603 --> 37:07.814
-Probably not stuck
on this island.
-(MOLLY CHUCKLING)

37:09.107 --> 37:12.026
Well... Now I am here.

37:13.611 --> 37:16.406
I can't think of anybody
I'd rather be stranded with.

37:23.913 --> 37:25.581
-Thanks for that.
-No problem.

37:25.665 --> 37:28.835
Open up the bonnet.
We'll make sure
there's no damage.

37:28.918 --> 37:31.879
Right, I should be off.
I've got a loch to restock.

37:31.963 --> 37:34.215
I could do with a hand
if you're not too busy.

37:39.012 --> 37:40.138
Sure.

37:53.026 --> 37:54.944
So where are you off to, then?

37:56.863 --> 37:58.656
Just fancied a break,
that's all.

38:07.999 --> 38:10.543
Right. Matches?

38:11.878 --> 38:13.796
Well, I haven't got any.

38:13.880 --> 38:15.923
Well, don't look at me.

38:17.508 --> 38:19.802
Waste of time collecting
all that, then, wasn't it?

38:20.762 --> 38:22.221
Might have known
though, really.

38:23.598 --> 38:25.350
Excuse me.

38:25.433 --> 38:27.435
If you hadn't been so
desperate to be first
in our lifeboat,

38:27.518 --> 38:28.936
then we wouldn't be here.

38:29.020 --> 38:31.064
You started all this.
How do you work that out?

38:31.147 --> 38:33.733
-DOROTHY: It's obvious.
-You have to have
the last word, don't you?

38:34.359 --> 38:35.485
No.

38:37.028 --> 38:39.280
So where was it
you were going?

38:39.781 --> 38:41.074
London.

38:41.157 --> 38:43.659
Oh, yeah? How long for?

38:44.577 --> 38:46.204
Don't know yet.

38:46.287 --> 38:49.582
There is another way,
you know.

38:49.665 --> 38:52.877
-What are you talking about?
-To sort this out.

38:52.960 --> 38:55.713
You could admit you made
a mistake and apologise.

38:55.797 --> 39:00.968
No way I'm apologising!
Look, why don't all of you
get off my back? It's my life.

39:04.764 --> 39:07.016
I tried talking to him.
Wouldn't listen to me.

39:09.352 --> 39:10.853
Why should he?

39:10.937 --> 39:13.064
Seems to me you're
both doing the same thing.

39:13.898 --> 39:15.358
What do you mean?

39:15.441 --> 39:18.069
Both running and
both leaving a mess
behind you.

39:18.152 --> 39:20.738
Except, he seems to have
beaten you to it.

39:51.936 --> 39:54.063
You and Paul are certainly
seeing a lot of each other.

39:54.147 --> 39:56.524
God! Don't you start,

39:56.607 --> 39:58.776
I've just had to put him
straight on a couple
of things.

40:03.322 --> 40:05.950
I know the feeling.
I won't be a minute.

40:20.757 --> 40:23.092
-You're doing my nut in.
-I'm sorry.

40:23.176 --> 40:26.429
What for?
Locking the door on me
or causing an accident?

40:26.512 --> 40:27.889
That wasn't supposed
to happen.

40:27.972 --> 40:30.183
But it did, didn't it?
We could have been killed.

40:30.266 --> 40:31.309
I know.

40:32.685 --> 40:34.062
Listen.

40:34.145 --> 40:37.273
It is over between you and me.

40:37.357 --> 40:39.692
-You've got to move on.
-All right.

40:41.486 --> 40:42.945
Right, so...

40:44.322 --> 40:48.076
From now on,
will you leave me alone?

40:48.159 --> 40:49.702
If that's what
you really want.

40:49.786 --> 40:51.954
It is. Yes.

40:59.379 --> 41:01.297
Might see you later then,
darling.

41:12.350 --> 41:14.143
Just try it a wee bit faster.

41:14.227 --> 41:17.522
Can't stand much more of this.

41:17.605 --> 41:18.731
MOLLY: We are not
giving up yet.

41:18.815 --> 41:20.650
GOLLY: Do you want me
to do it?

41:20.733 --> 41:22.819
MOLLY: No, no, I did it
once in the Girl Guides,
I can do it again.

41:22.902 --> 41:24.654
GOLLY: Okay, Okay.

41:24.737 --> 41:28.116
No! Come on, Molly.

-Yes.

-DUNCAN: Lexie!
-JESS: Dad!

41:40.920 --> 41:42.255
Have you seen Molly?

41:42.338 --> 41:43.506
-DUNCAN: No,
have you seen Lexie?
-PAUL: No.

41:43.589 --> 41:45.049
-Where is everybody?
-Weird.

41:45.133 --> 41:47.885
-It's a bit spooky.
-Is anybody home?

41:52.974 --> 41:55.226
Hang on a minute.
Come and have a look at this.

41:57.478 --> 41:58.855
Can you see that smoke?

42:01.649 --> 42:03.109
DUNCAN: Where are we going?

42:03.192 --> 42:05.445
PAUL: You're going anywhere.
I want you in the kitchen.

42:05.528 --> 42:08.489
If they're stuck out there,
they'll want some hot food.
And it's your turn to cook.

42:08.573 --> 42:10.074
ANDREW:
What are we going to do?

42:10.158 --> 42:12.243
PAUL: I haven't got a clue.
I'll think of something.

42:14.203 --> 42:15.955
Right,
does anyone fancy a dram?

42:16.039 --> 42:18.291
Ooh, yes, yes, please.

42:20.293 --> 42:22.754
Maybe, being stuck here
won't be too bad.

42:22.837 --> 42:24.005
Or...

42:24.088 --> 42:26.215
Maybe we can
get off after all.

42:26.299 --> 42:27.467
GOLLY: Huh?

42:27.550 --> 42:28.634
Look.

42:32.972 --> 42:34.766

what I'm thinking?

It's no use. I can't reach it.

42:45.068 --> 42:47.862
For goodness sake.
I've had enough of this.

42:47.945 --> 42:48.988
LEXIE: What are you doing?

42:49.072 --> 42:52.033
Well, being wet
didn't kill me before

42:52.116 --> 42:55.203
and I don't suppose
it will again.

42:55.286 --> 42:57.121
MOLLY: Dorothy? Be careful.

42:57.205 --> 42:58.831
GOLLY: Careful!

42:58.915 --> 43:00.458

Mind yourself on the rocks.

-Well done!

43:07.256 --> 43:09.300
MOLLY: Well done, Dorothy.

43:09.384 --> 43:12.512
Now, all we need is something
waterproof, you know,
so we can block up that hole.

43:12.595 --> 43:14.514
I don't remember
seeing anything.

43:14.597 --> 43:16.849
We must have scoured
the whole island when we
were looking for the wood.

43:20.687 --> 43:24.982
Maybe, I should start a range
of black plastic swimwear.

43:28.903 --> 43:31.155
All right we're going to
need two people in here.

43:31.239 --> 43:34.158
One to paddle and
the other one just
to hold this in place.

43:34.242 --> 43:37.328
DOROTHY: The first thing
you do when you get to shore
is find me something to wear.

43:37.412 --> 43:40.206
-Then it's just you
and me then, lass.
-No way.

43:40.289 --> 43:42.875
I rather think
I've done my bit.

43:42.959 --> 43:44.460
No, I wasn't meaning you.

43:46.254 --> 43:48.631
There is no way Golly
you are getting in this canoe.

43:48.715 --> 43:50.258
We still don't know
how bad your injuries are.

43:50.341 --> 43:51.843
I'm fine.

43:51.926 --> 43:53.720

We can do it.

Right, I think we're all set.

Before you go...

44:02.520 --> 44:04.814
I owe you an apology.

44:04.897 --> 44:07.275
Some of the things
I said earlier,
I wasn't being fair.

44:09.152 --> 44:12.405
No. I'm sorry.

44:12.488 --> 44:16.743
And this whole stupid
sabotage thing
was all my idea.

44:18.161 --> 44:19.620
I should have
listened to you, Golly.

44:21.039 --> 44:23.124
I just...

44:23.207 --> 44:26.127
I just wanted to
be taken seriously.

44:26.210 --> 44:28.796
You know,
earn a little bit of respect.

44:28.880 --> 44:32.050
Well, you have,
repairing the canoe.

44:32.133 --> 44:34.844
Well, that was a team effort.

44:34.927 --> 44:36.304

44:37.096 --> 44:39.057
We're in your debt.

44:39.140 --> 44:43.144
Well, maybe there is something
you could do for me.

If I can.

44:45.104 --> 44:46.356
Ewan.

44:46.439 --> 44:47.732

don't go to the police.

him off scot-free.

clear up the mess

with my herbaceous borders.

45:04.874 --> 45:06.501
I will make sure he does.

Then why won't you tell me
the truth about you
and Hermione?

45:40.451 --> 45:43.121
-You two are an item again,
aren't you?
-No.

45:43.204 --> 45:46.457
You went for lunch.
She told me.

45:46.541 --> 45:47.792
Nothing happened.

45:47.875 --> 45:49.877
Yeah, how many times
have I heard that?

45:52.380 --> 45:54.757
What does it matter, anyway?

45:54.841 --> 45:56.634
I just...
I don't like being lied to.

45:57.593 --> 45:59.178
You're not.

45:59.262 --> 46:00.471
She's a bampot.

46:03.725 --> 46:05.351
Honestly...

46:05.435 --> 46:06.894
She won't leave me alone.

46:07.603 --> 46:08.896
Why?

46:08.980 --> 46:11.733
Because she wants
us to get back together.

46:11.816 --> 46:13.443
Tell her you're
not interested.

46:13.526 --> 46:15.528
I've tried, believe me.

46:15.611 --> 46:17.780
She won't take no
for an answer.

46:26.664 --> 46:27.665
(CAR STOPPING)

47:00.698 --> 47:02.116
Come here.

47:05.203 --> 47:06.746
What are you doing?

47:07.705 --> 47:09.374
Hermione's out there.

47:09.457 --> 47:12.001
If she thinks we're together,
she might back off.

47:24.097 --> 47:25.723
No, we shouldn't
be doing this.

47:25.807 --> 47:26.974
What do you mean?

47:27.058 --> 47:29.352
We've got to work together.

47:29.435 --> 47:31.396
And you're my
best friend's daughter.

47:31.479 --> 47:34.649
Yeah, it was just
to help you out.
Didn't mean anything.

47:35.775 --> 47:38.361
-Yeah, of course.
-Right. Good.

47:50.498 --> 47:52.500
So far, so good.

47:52.583 --> 47:54.711
Yep. Nearly there.

47:54.794 --> 47:56.004
-Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
-What?

47:56.087 --> 47:57.880
-We're starting to ship water.
-What?

47:57.964 --> 48:01.050
-Yes.
-Well, get it out.

48:01.134 --> 48:04.637
We're sinking.
Lexie, we are sinking.
Go faster.

48:04.721 --> 48:06.305
I'm trying, I'm trying.

48:06.389 --> 48:08.599
LEXIE: Help! Help!

48:08.683 --> 48:10.768
Oh, my God!

48:10.852 --> 48:13.146
MOLLY: Keep going, keep going.

48:14.605 --> 48:15.606
(BOAT APPROACHING)

48:18.484 --> 48:20.695
-Paddle.
-Help!

48:22.447 --> 48:24.532
-Keep paddling!
-Help!

48:25.658 --> 48:26.659
(SCREAMING)

48:39.839 --> 48:41.174
Quick!

48:44.677 --> 48:46.721
Give me your hand.
Come on.

48:52.435 --> 48:55.563
-Are you all right?
-You took your time.

48:55.646 --> 48:57.774
I had the cleaning to do,
didn't I?

49:02.945 --> 49:04.655
GOLLY: It's only a scratch.

49:11.954 --> 49:13.456
You came back, then?

49:13.539 --> 49:16.292
Aye. You were right.

49:16.376 --> 49:18.002
It's time to face the music.

49:21.005 --> 49:24.008
Well, now's your chance.
Good luck.

49:27.095 --> 49:30.223
I don't want you to
say a word, young man.

49:31.265 --> 49:32.600
Not even if it's sorry.

49:35.937 --> 49:37.480
Apology accepted.

49:38.856 --> 49:40.983
I won't be taking
the matter further...

49:41.067 --> 49:42.819
This time.

49:42.902 --> 49:44.278
That's brilliant. Thanks.

49:45.780 --> 49:48.032
Nice one.

49:48.116 --> 49:50.952
If you hadn't have turned up
when you did...

49:51.035 --> 49:53.663
-I'm glad I came back.
-I think we all are.

49:55.540 --> 49:57.458
Won't you come
for something to eat?

49:57.542 --> 49:58.751
Time to hit the road.

50:00.545 --> 50:02.463
I'm sorry, Molly.

50:02.547 --> 50:03.923
For everything.

50:07.468 --> 50:10.263
You know I'd never take you
back, you naughty boy...

50:13.141 --> 50:14.726
But I do forgive you.

50:17.270 --> 50:19.313
I'd like us
to part as friends.

50:20.815 --> 50:22.859
Yes, so would I.

50:27.321 --> 50:28.656
Goodbye, Molly.

50:31.909 --> 50:33.411
Goodbye.

50:42.211 --> 50:43.504
Good luck.

51:02.565 --> 51:04.942
Thanks for the clothes, Lexie.

51:05.026 --> 51:07.362
I'll bring them back
as soon as I can.

51:07.445 --> 51:10.323
Yeah, well make sure
you leave enough time
to stop and have a coffee.

51:10.406 --> 51:11.783
It's nice to have
a proper chat.

51:11.866 --> 51:13.618
Absolutely.

51:13.701 --> 51:18.039
And I think the first thing
we should talk about is
shared fishing rights.

51:18.414 --> 51:19.749
Sorry?

51:19.832 --> 51:22.794
Well, if the islands
not going to be a sanctuary,

51:22.877 --> 51:26.089
Kilwillie estate might as well
make some profit.

51:28.299 --> 51:31.636
Mmm. This is wonderful.

51:32.095 --> 51:33.346
Mmm.

51:33.429 --> 51:35.306
Please, pass my
compliments to the cook.

51:36.766 --> 51:38.559
Well, perhaps you
can tell him yourself.

51:42.563 --> 51:45.483
It's okay.
Maybe a touch
less salt next time.

51:46.776 --> 51:48.611
I'm glad you like it.

51:48.695 --> 51:49.987
What is it?

51:51.030 --> 51:52.532
Lentil and bacon.

51:59.372 --> 52:01.916
Well, maybe you could go
and work in the pub again.

52:04.043 --> 52:06.004
So are you looking for a job?

52:07.255 --> 52:09.090
Do you know of anything?

52:09.173 --> 52:12.135
Well, after the rescue job
you made on his soup...

52:12.218 --> 52:15.596
Hey! I don't think
you could do any better.

52:15.680 --> 52:18.099
Well, perhaps,
I won't have to.

52:18.182 --> 52:20.435
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

52:20.518 --> 52:24.147
Well, the rota
wasn't a success.

52:24.230 --> 52:28.401
Yeah and if it gives us
more time for our real jobs,
it makes financial sense.

52:30.028 --> 52:32.822
Right, well,
we'll give you a go.
See how it works out.

52:37.035 --> 52:38.244
Duncan.

52:41.247 --> 52:44.459
-Don't you ever give up?
-I'm not here to see you.

52:44.542 --> 52:47.128
In fact, If I never see you
again, it'll be too soon.

52:47.211 --> 52:49.464
No. It's her
I wanted to speak to.

52:51.090 --> 52:53.343
If only to warn her
what she's letting
herself in for.

52:55.511 --> 52:57.889
I hope you're satisfied now.

52:57.972 --> 52:59.807
-He's all yours.
-Uh, listen, Hermione...

52:59.891 --> 53:03.978
Just don't be surprised
if he breaks your heart,

53:04.062 --> 53:05.355
like he's broken mine.

53:07.273 --> 53:08.775
Goodbye, Duncan.

53:16.532 --> 53:17.909
That's not how it looks.

53:21.079 --> 53:22.121
It's not.
