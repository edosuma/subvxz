00:01.990 --> 00:06.989
Previously on "Big Brother":
With the four jurors battling to

00:06.990 --> 00:11.989
get back in the game, the
dentist was crowned the Victor.

00:11.990 --> 00:14.989
John has earned his way back
into "Big Brother" house.

00:14.990 --> 00:17.999
But he still had to fight it
out for head of household.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.289
It's down to the final two,
John versus Vanessa.

00:21.290 --> 00:25.119
And in the end, he fell to
Vanessa.

00:25.120 --> 00:27.989
Vanessa is the new head of
household.

00:27.990 --> 00:29.989
Looking to improve her odds
in the game...

00:29.990 --> 00:32.989
I love working with Austin
and the twins but at the end of

00:32.990 --> 00:37.699
the day I'm a fool if I don't
realize I'm at the bottom of

00:37.700 --> 00:37.990
their totem poll.

00:37.991 --> 00:41.999
The poker player formed a
secret alliance with John and

00:42.000 --> 00:42.950
Steve.

00:42.951 --> 00:48.999
After turning aus-twins against
James and Meg.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.699
I one million percent do not
trust Meg and James.

00:52.700 --> 00:53.999
I want them out.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.829
Vanessa gave the friend-mance
one last chance chance to change

01:00.830 --> 01:00.990
their fate.

01:00.991 --> 01:05.119
If they have some information
that Austin doesn't totally have

01:05.120 --> 01:07.989
my back I'm open minded to hear
it right now.

01:07.990 --> 01:11.989
Is there any information I could
use.

01:11.990 --> 01:13.999
I was never filled in on that.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.989
She set the stage for their
demise.

01:16.990 --> 01:19.949
How do either of you guys
feel like being pawns?

01:19.950 --> 01:22.989
The two of us have been on the
block a freaking lot.

01:22.990 --> 01:26.949
At the nomination ceremony...
>> I have nominated you, Meg,

01:26.950 --> 01:27.989
and you James.

01:27.990 --> 01:30.989
James and Meg quickly
realized they were no pawns.

01:30.990 --> 01:36.989
I won't hesitate to put a
king in check.

01:36.990 --> 01:39.989
Tonight, it's do or die for
the country boy and the the city

01:39.990 --> 01:40.990
girl.

01:40.991 --> 01:42.989
Will one of them be saved by the
power of veto?

01:42.990 --> 01:47.989
Find out right now on "big
brother."

01:47.990 --> 01:49.540
I'm going to bed soon.

02:25.990 --> 02:26.990
This nomination ceremony is

02:26.991 --> 02:32.989
adjourned.

02:32.990 --> 02:36.989
I decide to nominate Meg and
James because they're a strong

02:36.990 --> 02:38.989
couple, not on my side of the
house.

02:38.990 --> 02:40.989
I'm not sure I can trust them,
and at the end of the day this

02:40.990 --> 02:45.409
option will allow me to get the
least blood on my hands this

02:45.410 --> 02:45.990
week.

02:45.991 --> 02:50.699
Once again, I am sitting next
to my best friend on the block,

02:50.700 --> 02:54.289
and it's a lose-lose situation.

02:54.290 --> 02:58.989
Every single person has been
taken from me, and this is now

02:58.990 --> 03:01.989
the worst of the worst.

03:01.990 --> 03:07.119
It's been the hardest week so
far.

03:07.120 --> 03:11.989
It definitely sucks being on
the block with your Ally, but

03:11.990 --> 03:14.989
the power of veto is definitely
important.

03:14.990 --> 03:17.989
It assures that one of us at
least comes down off the block

03:17.990 --> 03:19.989
and gets some revenge.

03:19.990 --> 03:20.950
Good luck, man.

03:20.951 --> 03:24.989
Thanks.

03:24.990 --> 03:27.989
If you want to talk, I'm
happy to explain.

03:27.990 --> 03:28.990
Like, details.

03:28.990 --> 03:29.120
You understand?

03:29.121 --> 03:30.699
Yeah.

03:30.700 --> 03:33.539
It's my move now, you know
what I'm saying?

03:33.540 --> 03:34.540
Game-wise that's all it is.

03:34.540 --> 03:34.990
It's nothing personal.

03:34.991 --> 03:36.989
I don't have any particular
target in mind.

03:36.990 --> 03:37.990
You're good.

03:37.991 --> 03:41.989
You're good.

03:41.990 --> 03:49.990
It's awkward.

03:50.700 --> 03:51.700
You okay?

03:51.701 --> 03:53.989
Yeah.

03:53.990 --> 03:56.999
Man they Clay and shellied us.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.989
She said there's no clear target
but I'm pretty sure it's going

04:00.990 --> 04:01.410
to be me.

04:01.411 --> 04:04.989
One of us has to win veto
because I ain't sitting next to

04:04.990 --> 04:12.990
you on Thursday.

04:13.990 --> 04:21.989
Meg, it's okay.

04:21.990 --> 04:23.989
One of us is going home.

04:23.990 --> 04:25.989
Oh, yeah, no doubt, yeah.

04:25.990 --> 04:33.990
Either I go home or I have to
stay here without you.

04:34.990 --> 04:36.989
You've always wanted to see
the jury house.

04:36.990 --> 04:41.289
We get the full "Big Brother"
effect.

04:41.290 --> 04:43.989
Did you want to talk to Vanessa?

04:43.990 --> 04:46.989
Maybe you all can hash
everything out.

04:46.990 --> 04:49.989
Maybe there's something we
didn't know or Austin said.

04:49.990 --> 04:54.989
Uh-huh.

04:54.990 --> 04:56.989
Funny that he kept her.

04:56.990 --> 05:00.999
I know.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.989
What's really frustrating is
that four weeks ago, we decided

05:04.990 --> 05:08.989
to keep Vanessa over Shelli when
they were on the block together,

05:08.990 --> 05:11.989
and now it is coming back to
haunt us.

05:11.990 --> 05:14.989
I want to give you what I
didn't have in a similar

05:14.990 --> 05:14.993
- situation.
- >> Yeah.

05:14.993 --> 05:17.989
Which is the benefit of an
understanding why.

05:17.990 --> 05:21.989
I am so alone in the game I have
to make moves that allow me to

05:21.990 --> 05:23.989
move up on that totele poll.

05:23.990 --> 05:27.989
It's nothing but respect for you
two as competitors.

05:27.990 --> 05:30.989
Beyond that, you have a very
tight alliance and your

05:30.990 --> 05:34.539
loyalties will be to each other
above everyone else.

05:34.540 --> 05:35.989
I'm at the bottom of
everyone's...

05:35.990 --> 05:36.290
sorry.

05:36.291 --> 05:40.949
I know it's probably really
hard to sit up next to someone

05:40.950 --> 05:41.989
you have been relying on.

05:41.990 --> 05:45.989
I wouldn't know what that's like
because I have never had someone

05:45.990 --> 05:47.949
to rely on in this game.

05:47.950 --> 05:51.989
Vanessa, I never, ever
targeted you or was going to you

05:51.990 --> 05:51.991
up.

05:51.991 --> 05:54.989
That was never anything I was
going to be part of.

05:54.990 --> 05:56.989
If anything the two of us fought
to have you stay that week.

05:56.990 --> 06:00.829
I feel like I've been playing
such a fool.

06:00.830 --> 06:02.989
Trust me, it's not easy.

06:02.990 --> 06:04.949
I don't feel good about it.

06:04.950 --> 06:06.989
I have a full body sweat going,
all right.

06:06.990 --> 06:07.990
Vanessa, it's not that.

06:07.991 --> 06:10.949
All right.

06:10.950 --> 06:12.989
I feel like a wuss.

06:12.990 --> 06:14.949
Don't feel like a wuss.

06:14.950 --> 06:14.990
It's okay.

06:14.991 --> 06:15.990
Give me a hug.

06:15.990 --> 06:16.990
Come on.

06:16.991 --> 06:24.991
It's just like...
>> you have to win p. O.V..

06:27.410 --> 06:29.989
It's the only chance we have.

06:29.990 --> 06:37.990
The most important veto comp.

06:41.990 --> 06:44.539
Has Meg come out of that room
at all?

06:44.540 --> 06:47.289
They were in there a while ago.

06:47.290 --> 06:49.949
Have they talked to you at all?

06:49.950 --> 06:49.990
Very little.

06:49.991 --> 06:52.989
What do you think is the best
move?

06:52.990 --> 06:54.989
If James won the veto?

06:54.990 --> 06:57.289
You just want Meg to go?

06:57.290 --> 06:58.989
No, anything.

06:58.990 --> 07:02.989
I want to win the game.

07:02.990 --> 07:07.989
Take a shot somewhere else or
still try to get Meg evicted

07:07.990 --> 07:08.990
although it's almost impob.

07:08.991 --> 07:15.989
Your choices would be me,
John, or aus-twins.

07:15.990 --> 07:18.989
That's all that's left.

07:18.990 --> 07:23.699
I can't risk, like, my
positioning.

07:23.700 --> 07:24.410
I know what you mean.

07:24.411 --> 07:29.989
If I piss off aus-twins, I've
pissed off every person in this

07:29.990 --> 07:29.991
house.

07:29.991 --> 07:32.989
I can't... it would be the most
dumb move of all time.

07:32.990 --> 07:36.989
Like, you do realize how pivotal
a role I've played with every

07:36.990 --> 07:43.989
single eviction.

07:43.990 --> 07:47.989
Like, I have so much blood on my
hands, I'm ( Bleep ) In this

07:47.990 --> 07:48.700
game.

07:48.701 --> 07:51.989
You trust aus-twins will take
us to five?

07:51.990 --> 07:52.990
I do, I do.

07:52.991 --> 07:57.699
Okay.

07:57.700 --> 08:01.989
I really hope James doesn't
win the veto.

08:01.990 --> 08:06.989
If he wins it, it's going to be
terrible.

08:06.990 --> 08:10.989
Hey, everybody, it's time to
pick players for the veto

08:10.990 --> 08:16.699
competition!

08:16.700 --> 08:19.989
Only six people will participate
in the veto competition... the

08:19.990 --> 08:22.989
head of household, the two
nominees and three other players

08:22.990 --> 08:24.989
selected by random traw.

08:24.990 --> 08:29.989
Would the nominees please join
me up here.

08:29.990 --> 08:37.989
As h.O.H., I will pick first.

08:37.990 --> 08:37.991
Julia.

08:37.991 --> 08:45.991
<i>( Applause )
</i>>> I want to get picked to play

08:50.830 --> 08:53.989
in this veto, because even
though I'm work close with

08:53.990 --> 08:56.989
Vanessa, I'm resurrected in this
game which puts another target

08:56.990 --> 08:59.119
on my back and I'd like to
ensure my safety this week.

08:59.120 --> 08:59.990
Liz.

08:59.990 --> 09:00.990
Yeah!

09:00.991 --> 09:07.989
( Applause )
>> It sucks that James and I are

09:07.990 --> 09:08.999
in this position.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.989
We're the only ones playing for
ourselves.

09:12.990 --> 09:15.989
I'm pretty sure everyone else
would keep the nominations the

09:15.990 --> 09:15.991
same.

09:15.991 --> 09:17.989
We need to win this.

09:17.990 --> 09:18.990
Austin.

09:18.991 --> 09:24.989
<i>( Applause )
</i>>> Picking players couldn't have

09:24.990 --> 09:26.409
gone better for me.

09:26.410 --> 09:27.989
Austin and the twins get picked.

09:27.990 --> 09:30.989
These are three people I know I
can count on to fight to win the

09:30.990 --> 09:33.949
veto and try to keep noms the
same.

09:33.950 --> 09:35.989
"Big Brother" will inform us
when the competition is to

09:35.990 --> 09:36.410
begin.

09:36.410 --> 09:36.990
Good luck.

09:36.991 --> 09:44.991
<i>( Applause )
</i>>> Well, that couldn't have

09:49.120 --> 09:50.120
played out any better.

09:50.121 --> 09:51.539
I know.

09:51.540 --> 09:54.989
I think Liz is going to try
to win it.

09:54.990 --> 09:57.289
I think Austin is going to
try to win it.

09:57.290 --> 09:59.989
They don't want to be
backdoored.

09:59.990 --> 10:02.539
They're not going to want to use
it on us.

10:02.540 --> 10:06.989
And they're not going to want to
use it for Vanessa.

10:06.990 --> 10:10.949
Yeah, I know.

10:10.950 --> 10:13.699
Man.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.989
Whatever this comp is, if I
don't win this comp, I deserve

10:15.990 --> 10:16.990
to go home.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.539
What do you think it's going
to be?

10:18.540 --> 10:21.989
I hope it's something real
physical, something you have to

10:21.990 --> 10:22.990
go down and dirty.

10:22.990 --> 10:22.991
I don't.

10:22.991 --> 10:27.989
I was thinking of coming out
with the veto comp this blanket

10:27.990 --> 10:32.989
wrapped around me and the the
hood and the glasses scare

10:32.990 --> 10:32.991
Austin.

10:32.991 --> 10:34.989
Let me see if it would work,
like that.

10:34.990 --> 10:35.990
We both should do this.

10:35.991 --> 10:43.989
Ready for the veto comp!

10:43.990 --> 10:46.989
I feel like the odds are in our
favor to win a veto.

10:46.990 --> 10:50.289
Yeah, yeah.

10:50.290 --> 10:53.989
Both our butts are... backs are
against the wall, and I... and

10:53.990 --> 10:55.990
this is one time we absolutely
need it.

11:13.990 --> 11:16.989
I just got back.

11:16.990 --> 11:19.989
I had my daughter, Bailey.

11:19.990 --> 11:21.989
I love her very much.

11:21.990 --> 11:25.989
I'm a proud dad, but I have to
say Bailey came into this world

11:25.990 --> 11:26.990
in an unexpected way.

11:26.991 --> 11:30.989
One night I had too much fun,
and I'm going to fast forward

11:30.990 --> 11:32.539
this... nine months later.

11:32.540 --> 11:36.989
It was, like, 4:00 in the
morning and I looked at my God.

11:36.990 --> 11:38.829
20 missed text messages.

11:38.830 --> 11:44.989
And I looked through and it said
Brianna, Brianna, and I was like

11:44.990 --> 11:45.990
what the the hell.

11:45.991 --> 11:48.989
I threw my phone down and I was
like whatever.

11:48.990 --> 11:51.989
I called her and she told me you
might want to come down to the

11:51.990 --> 11:53.539
hospital to meet your daughter.

11:53.540 --> 11:57.829
And I was like, "y'all stop
playing.

11:57.830 --> 11:58.989
Cut that out.

11:58.990 --> 12:00.989
Y'all are just messing with me.

12:00.990 --> 12:02.409
And they're like no, we're not.

12:02.410 --> 12:04.989
The family members, once the
head popped out, it was like,

12:04.990 --> 12:05.990
oh, crap.

12:05.991 --> 12:08.829
This is James' baby.

12:08.830 --> 12:13.289
Yeah, so I went up to the
Al, and I looke looked like, you

12:13.290 --> 12:14.949
know, I saw a ghost.

12:14.950 --> 12:17.989
Before I even got to the room
they said, "sir, are you okay

12:17.990 --> 12:17.991
in?

12:17.991 --> 12:20.119
I said, "I have a little girl."

12:20.120 --> 12:22.989
And they said, "that's great,
congratulations."

12:22.990 --> 12:25.989
I said, "I just found out two
hours ago."

12:25.990 --> 12:29.289
They were like, "ohhh..."

12:29.290 --> 12:29.990
Oh, man.

12:29.991 --> 12:34.989
In all the chaos and madness, it
was definitely a blessing in

12:34.990 --> 12:37.989
disguise, and I love my little
girl dearly.

12:37.990 --> 12:38.990
I'm doing all this for you.

12:38.990 --> 12:39.990
And now lith bay is here.

12:39.991 --> 12:41.989
Now, little bay is here.

12:41.990 --> 12:42.999
But it was like, whoa!

12:43.000 --> 12:44.989
Yeah, it was a whoa.

12:44.990 --> 12:51.989
Yeah.

12:51.990 --> 12:54.989
Hey, everyone, it's time for
the veto competition.

12:54.990 --> 12:56.989
Let's head to the backyard.

12:56.990 --> 13:04.990
Yeah!

13:05.990 --> 13:07.989
♪ ♪ ♪ >> oh, my God.

13:07.990 --> 13:10.989
So we walk outside and it's a
cool retrogame show.

13:10.990 --> 13:13.989
And I love game shows.

13:13.990 --> 13:15.949
I'm a 90s kid.

13:15.950 --> 13:16.989
What's behind door number 3?

13:16.990 --> 13:19.289
It's a veto medallion.

13:19.290 --> 13:19.990
Why, thank you.

13:19.991 --> 13:22.989
I'll take that.

13:22.990 --> 13:22.991
Mwa.

13:22.991 --> 13:30.989
Players welcome to "hide & go
veto.

13:30.990 --> 13:34.699
Hide and seek probably seems
like child's play to you, but

13:34.700 --> 13:37.989
today, it could mean the
difference between leaving or

13:37.990 --> 13:40.989
staying inside the "Big Brother"
house.

13:40.990 --> 13:41.290
Oh, God.

13:41.291 --> 13:45.989
Each of you will be
separated, unably to speak or

13:45.990 --> 13:46.950
communicate with one another.

13:46.951 --> 13:51.409
One at a time, you'll enter the
house and have three minutes to

13:51.410 --> 13:52.989
hide your veto cawrd.

13:52.990 --> 13:57.829
Once all the cards have been
hidden, one at a time, you must

13:57.830 --> 14:00.989
search through the house to find
your opponent's veto cards.

14:00.990 --> 14:03.989
But keep in mind, all of the
veto cards look exactly the

14:03.990 --> 14:07.989
same, so you won't know which
houseguest's veto card you're

14:07.990 --> 14:08.990
bringing back out.

14:08.991 --> 14:14.989
You'll need to search quickly
because your turn only lasts two

14:14.990 --> 14:14.993
- minutes.
- >> Whoa!

14:14.993 --> 14:18.989
Once the veto card is found
it will be placed on the board.

14:18.990 --> 14:21.989
The houseguest who hides their
veto card the best will win the

14:21.990 --> 14:23.989
power of veto.

14:23.990 --> 14:31.989
Are you ready to play "hide & go
veto."

14:31.990 --> 14:34.989
( Applause )
>> All right, Meg, you're up

14:34.990 --> 14:34.991
first.

14:34.991 --> 14:37.989
Whoo-hooo.

14:37.990 --> 14:38.990
Yeah.

14:38.990 --> 14:39.990
Grandma!

14:39.991 --> 14:43.989
This is the first time that
I've ever had to fight for

14:43.990 --> 14:48.119
myself, and it feels very
personal to me because James and

14:48.120 --> 14:51.989
I have been put upon as this
best friend duo, so we need to

14:51.990 --> 14:57.949
make sure that this is the most
bad-ass game of hide and seek

14:57.950 --> 14:58.000
I've ever played.

14:58.001 --> 15:01.989
God, man, this house is going
to be destroyed.

15:01.990 --> 15:06.989
In this comp tirkz the goal is
to find the best hiding spot in

15:06.990 --> 15:08.829
the house for your veto card.

15:08.830 --> 15:13.989
At the end of five rounds, whose
ever veto card hasn't been found

15:13.990 --> 15:14.700
wins.

15:14.701 --> 15:19.409
I decide to hide my veto card in
the front bedroom in between a

15:19.410 --> 15:22.989
little nook and cranny in our
daybed.

15:22.990 --> 15:24.989
It is a perfect hiding spot.

15:24.990 --> 15:27.989
Not only is it in a nook and
cranny but it's under a

15:27.990 --> 15:28.990
mattress, and I'm feeling good.

15:28.991 --> 15:32.989
<i>Good.</i>

15:32.990 --> 15:36.989
I'm putting my veto card in
the did you have a cover of the

15:36.990 --> 15:37.950
daybed.

15:37.951 --> 15:41.409
What I'm hoping for is that no
one actually unbuttons this

15:41.410 --> 15:42.290
thing and finds it.

15:42.291 --> 15:43.989
We'll see.

15:43.990 --> 15:44.990
Me and Meg are the targets.

15:44.991 --> 15:48.989
At least if I can win the veto,
I can save myself, and hopefully

15:48.990 --> 15:53.989
save Meg later in the process.

15:53.990 --> 15:54.990
I'm captain camo.

15:54.991 --> 15:56.999
This is the perfect competition
for me hands down.

15:57.000 --> 16:01.989
If I can hide myself in every
nook and cranny to scare

16:01.990 --> 16:04.989
everybody in this house, I can
definitely take a small veto

16:04.990 --> 16:06.989
card and conceal it.

16:06.990 --> 16:08.989
It's gone.

16:08.990 --> 16:11.989
I decide to hide my veto card
in the parlor room.

16:11.990 --> 16:16.989
I'm going to unzip one of the
cushions on the couch, and place

16:16.990 --> 16:18.409
my veto card in there.

16:18.410 --> 16:20.999
I think people are going to be
throwing cushions and not

16:21.000 --> 16:22.989
unzipping the cushiones and look
inside of them.

16:22.990 --> 16:24.989
I got this one.

16:24.990 --> 16:28.989
My strategy is to put my veto
card in the place that I know

16:28.990 --> 16:29.990
best... the kitchen.

16:29.991 --> 16:34.989
I put my veto card in what I
know and love... pizza!

16:34.990 --> 16:40.999
No one is going to look inside
the actual pizza box.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.989
Steve isn't playing this
competition.

16:42.990 --> 16:45.989
He's the only one who eats that
pizza.

16:45.990 --> 16:48.989
I need nominations to state
the same, which means either

16:48.990 --> 16:52.989
myself, Austin, Liz or Julia
needs to win this thing.

16:52.990 --> 16:57.989
I decide to hide my veto card
inside a sofa kitchen.

16:57.990 --> 17:01.989
I thought hiding it in the
living room would be good

17:01.990 --> 17:06.989
because I thought it was one of
the last rooms people would

17:06.990 --> 17:06.991
ransack.

17:06.991 --> 17:11.539
All right, Meg, you have two
minutes to search for a veto

17:11.540 --> 17:11.990
cawrd.

17:11.991 --> 17:14.409
I'm trying to get into the
twins' mind and thinking of

17:14.410 --> 17:16.989
where they would hide some
things.

17:16.990 --> 17:19.989
They spend a large majority of
the time putting on makeup in

17:19.990 --> 17:27.990
the bathroom, so I hit there
first.

17:32.990 --> 17:35.409
I am tearing apart this house
because I know that my "big

17:35.410 --> 17:37.539
brother" life is at stake.

17:37.540 --> 17:40.989
And I have to find these veto
cards or else I am going home.

17:40.990 --> 17:48.990
And I not letting that happen.

17:49.990 --> 17:51.539
( Buzzer ).

17:51.540 --> 17:56.989
Meg comes back empty-handed.

17:56.990 --> 17:59.989
I'm going to flip everything
upside down in this room so that

17:59.990 --> 18:02.409
people can't find my veto card.

18:02.410 --> 18:03.989
The beds, they've got to go.

18:03.990 --> 18:06.539
The sheets, they're going.

18:06.540 --> 18:08.999
The mattresses, they're going.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.949
I'm flipping everything left and
right.

18:12.950 --> 18:14.989
I fear no object.

18:14.990 --> 18:15.990
( Buzzer ).

18:15.991 --> 18:22.989
Austin has returned without a
veto card.

18:22.990 --> 18:26.989
Is this veto competition is
definitely a good excuse for me

18:26.990 --> 18:27.990
to tear up the house.

18:27.991 --> 18:30.289
If it can be messed up, I'm
messing it up.

18:30.290 --> 18:38.290
I want to make it look like a
tornado's come through there.

18:40.990 --> 18:42.989
If I'm going out, I'm going out
with a bang.

18:42.990 --> 18:45.989
I'm going to destroy the whole
"Big Brother" house, and I'm

18:45.990 --> 18:50.989
going to love it.

18:50.990 --> 18:51.990
( Buzzer ).

18:51.991 --> 18:54.989
James did not return with a
veto card.

18:54.990 --> 18:56.989
The kitchen is a mess.

18:56.990 --> 19:00.989
I see cereal everywhere, and
who's going to clean that up

19:00.990 --> 19:02.989
because it's not going to be me.

19:02.990 --> 19:10.990
Oh, damn!

19:14.990 --> 19:16.539
( Buzzer ).

19:16.540 --> 19:18.989
Julia is back with nothing.

19:18.990 --> 19:23.949
It is so important for me or
my twin or Austin to win this

19:23.950 --> 19:25.989
veto because we want James out
of this house.

19:25.990 --> 19:27.989
And his pretty butt is going
home.

19:27.990 --> 19:29.989
You guys are good.

19:29.990 --> 19:31.699
( Buzzer ).

19:31.700 --> 19:34.289
Liz, you did not find a veto
card.

19:34.290 --> 19:36.989
Better luck next time.

19:36.990 --> 19:39.989
I'm channeling my inner James
here because James cannot win

19:39.990 --> 19:40.990
this thing.

19:40.990 --> 19:41.990
I'm searching high and low.

19:41.991 --> 19:45.989
I get down to the freezer, I see
these big square-shaped pizza

19:45.990 --> 19:50.989
boxes and I'm like that would be
a good spot for a veto card.

19:50.990 --> 19:50.991
Yes!

19:50.991 --> 19:54.989
I open it up, and we have a veto
card.

19:54.990 --> 19:58.989
( Applause )
>> Congratulations, Vanessa.

19:58.990 --> 20:01.989
You have found the first veto
card.

20:01.990 --> 20:09.990
There are four veto cards left
to be found.

20:12.120 --> 20:20.120
( Buzzer ) ( Buzzer )

20:44.990 --> 20:46.989
I love this game!

20:46.990 --> 20:49.989
I know no one's going to
place their veto cards in

20:49.990 --> 20:52.989
obvious spots so I'm thinking
similar to what I did... looking

20:52.990 --> 20:58.989
in clothes, looking in pillow
cushions, a spot that I would

20:58.990 --> 21:02.989
hide something.

21:02.990 --> 21:04.989
Yeah!

21:04.990 --> 21:05.990
Yeah!

21:05.991 --> 21:07.989
Congratulations, Julia.

21:07.990 --> 21:10.989
You have found the second veto
card.

21:10.990 --> 21:13.989
There are three veto cards left
to be found.

21:13.990 --> 21:18.699
I finally find a veto card,
and it better be Meg or James.

21:18.700 --> 21:20.999
I need to knock them out of this
game.

21:21.000 --> 21:27.989
( Buzzer )
>> I don't want to play this

21:27.990 --> 21:27.991
anymore.

21:27.991 --> 21:29.829
I'm running around the house.

21:29.830 --> 21:30.989
It is absolutely trashed.

21:30.990 --> 21:31.990
I can't.

21:31.990 --> 21:32.990
I can't.

21:32.991 --> 21:37.989
This is giving me anxiety.

21:37.990 --> 21:37.991
Oh, no!

21:37.991 --> 21:43.539
I have o.C.D., and I hate
messes.

21:43.540 --> 21:44.989
My messy cereal.

21:44.990 --> 21:46.699
Oh, God!

21:46.700 --> 21:50.539
( Buzzer ).

21:50.540 --> 21:54.989
I ran out of time in the
hammock room on my last run, but

21:54.990 --> 21:58.409
I am convinced there is a veto
card in there and I'm ready to

21:58.410 --> 22:03.989
tear this place apart.

22:03.990 --> 22:09.119
Sure enough, I find a veto card
in one of the cushions.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.989
Congratulations, Meg.

22:10.990 --> 22:13.989
You have found the third veto
card.

22:13.990 --> 22:14.990
Thank you, Steve.

22:14.991 --> 22:20.949
There are two veto cards left
to be found.

22:20.950 --> 22:22.989
I'm feeling so good that I
found a veto card.

22:22.990 --> 22:26.829
I know that I have just taken
someone out of the game.

22:26.830 --> 22:33.989
I am just praying that it wasn't
James.

22:33.990 --> 22:38.989
I'm doing everything I can to
think of where these veto cards

22:38.990 --> 22:39.990
could possibly be.

22:39.991 --> 22:41.989
James is one of the more sneaky
people in the house.

22:41.990 --> 22:46.989
I have a hunch that James is
probably under a giant decoy

22:46.990 --> 22:46.991
pile.

22:46.991 --> 22:52.989
( Buzzer )
>> At this point, I don't know

22:52.990 --> 22:56.829
if my veto card has been found
or not, but I still want to

22:56.830 --> 22:59.989
continue to cover up this day
room just in case it's in here.

22:59.990 --> 23:04.989
( Buzzer )
>> I'm back in the house, and I

23:04.990 --> 23:08.539
notice my card has not been
touched so my thing right now is

23:08.540 --> 23:11.989
throw as much stuff as I can in
front of the coach, so if they

23:11.990 --> 23:16.989
try to flip it and throw the rug
up, s the rug's not going that

23:16.989 --> 23:18.989
They would have to move all that
stuff out of the way to

23:18.990 --> 23:26.990
literally lift that rug up
halfway to see my card.

23:29.990 --> 23:32.989
Yeah, baby!

23:32.990 --> 23:34.989
( Applause )
>> Congratulations, James.

23:34.990 --> 23:39.409
You have brought back the fourth
veto card.

23:39.410 --> 23:47.410
There is one more veto card
left.

23:52.120 --> 23:53.949
( Buzzer ).

23:53.950 --> 23:56.989
Honestly, am so over this.

23:56.990 --> 23:58.989
That horn sounds and I am
going to town.

23:58.990 --> 24:00.289
I'm running through this house.

24:00.290 --> 24:04.699
I'm going to toss and turn
anything I need to find a veto

24:04.700 --> 24:04.990
card.

24:04.990 --> 24:05.990
Don't be mad.

24:05.990 --> 24:06.950
It's all for the game.

24:06.951 --> 24:14.951
( Buzzer ) ( Buzzer )

24:18.990 --> 24:22.539
There's only one veto card
left to find and a few places

24:22.540 --> 24:23.540
left to look.

24:23.541 --> 24:26.989
I feel like I'm getting close
here.

24:26.990 --> 24:29.989
I can't stress enough how much
Meg or James can't win this

24:29.990 --> 24:29.991
thing.

24:29.991 --> 24:32.989
It's time for me to end it once
and for all, and I'm not leaving

24:32.990 --> 24:34.990
this house without the veto card
in my hand.

24:48.830 --> 24:52.999
Cards, and I know my butt is on
the line for going to jury.

24:53.000 --> 24:57.119
Vanessa is in the house, and I
just know the simple fact that

24:57.120 --> 25:05.120
if she find my veto card, I'm
done.

25:05.540 --> 25:07.989
Congratulations, Vanessa.

25:07.990 --> 25:10.989
You have found the fifth veto
card, which means that this game

25:10.990 --> 25:14.989
is over.

25:14.990 --> 25:15.990
Yay!

25:15.990 --> 25:16.410
( Applause ).

25:16.411 --> 25:17.989
Good work, Vanessa.

25:17.990 --> 25:18.999
Thank you.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.989
Players, it is time for the
big reveal. F the

25:22.990 --> 25:27.989
veto card that has not been
found will win the power of

25:27.990 --> 25:27.991
veto.

25:27.991 --> 25:30.829
The first veto card was found by
Vanessa.

25:30.830 --> 25:38.830
Let's see who she eliminated.

25:40.990 --> 25:44.989
Liz, I'm sorry, but you have
been eliminated.

25:44.990 --> 25:52.990
All right, the second veto card
was found by Julia.

25:57.990 --> 25:59.409
Sorry, Vanessa.

25:59.410 --> 26:02.409
But you have been eliminated.

26:02.410 --> 26:04.989
I'm really bummed I didn't
win the veto.

26:04.990 --> 26:07.989
And I am crossing my fingers
that neither Meg or James will

26:07.990 --> 26:09.699
be able to win this thing.

26:09.700 --> 26:13.989
Meg, you found the third veto
card, let's see who you have

26:13.990 --> 26:14.830
eliminated.

26:14.831 --> 26:15.949
Big money!

26:15.950 --> 26:21.989
Big money!

26:21.990 --> 26:23.989
Sorry, girl.

26:23.990 --> 26:28.989
Julia, I'm sorry, but you've
been eliminated from the

26:28.990 --> 26:28.991
competition.

26:28.991 --> 26:30.989
James, you found the fourth veto
card.

26:30.990 --> 26:38.990
Let's find out who you've taken
out of the competition.

26:40.700 --> 26:43.949
Oh!

26:43.950 --> 26:44.989
I knew that!

26:44.990 --> 26:45.950
Sorry.

26:45.951 --> 26:51.409
, of course, it had to be
James who took me out!

26:51.410 --> 26:51.990
Ooooh!

26:51.991 --> 26:54.989
Meg, I'm sorry, but you have
been eliminated.

26:54.990 --> 26:58.119
James, the only way that you
can make this up to me is for

26:58.120 --> 26:59.989
you to win this veto.

26:59.990 --> 27:02.989
It all comes down to this.

27:02.990 --> 27:05.989
Either Austin or James will win
the power of veto.

27:05.990 --> 27:08.989
It always comes down to me
and Austin in competitions.

27:08.990 --> 27:09.990
Maybe it's a gag joke.

27:09.991 --> 27:11.989
Maybe it's just destiny or fate.

27:11.990 --> 27:16.999
But the thing, is I'm tired of
being next to sasquatch in a

27:17.000 --> 27:17.990
competition every time.

27:17.991 --> 27:22.989
What is the heck, it's pretty
much my best-and worst-case

27:22.990 --> 27:24.989
scenario right there on the
table as a possibility and I'm

27:24.990 --> 27:27.989
the one of all people who
brought the card out.

27:27.990 --> 27:29.989
Of course, it's a cliff hanger.

27:29.990 --> 27:31.119
Come on, big money.

27:31.120 --> 27:39.120
Daddy needs a veto medallion,
because he needs to be safe this

27:39.990 --> 27:40.990
week.

27:40.991 --> 27:43.989
Austin, I'm sorry, but you
have been eliminated.

27:43.990 --> 27:47.989
That means, congratulations,
James, you have won the golden

27:47.990 --> 27:48.990
power of veto.

27:48.991 --> 27:51.119
I just won the power of veto.

27:51.120 --> 27:54.989
Vanessa, you tried to make me
out, but it's not going to

27:54.990 --> 27:54.991
happen.

27:54.991 --> 27:56.989
This country boy's here to stay.

27:56.990 --> 27:59.989
For you, Bailey.

27:59.990 --> 28:02.989
I didn't win the the power of
veto, and it's becoming very

28:02.990 --> 28:05.999
real that I might be going home
this week.

28:06.000 --> 28:10.989
But I still have a chance
knowing that James is still in

28:10.990 --> 28:12.989
the game.

28:12.990 --> 28:15.989
This was the worst-case
scenario, James being able to

28:15.990 --> 28:16.990
pull himself off the block.

28:16.991 --> 28:19.989
Now I have to find a replacement
nominee, and I have no idea what

28:19.990 --> 28:27.990
I'm going to do.

28:40.700 --> 28:41.989
Raready, John.

28:41.990 --> 28:42.990
I don't think I'm ready.

28:42.991 --> 28:44.289
Who threw the cereal?

28:44.290 --> 28:45.989
That was not even relevant.

28:45.990 --> 28:46.990
Know it's James.

28:46.991 --> 28:50.989
Heck not, I didn't do all that.

28:50.990 --> 28:52.989
Look at all that.

28:52.990 --> 28:56.989
Let's see how pad it is oh, my
God!

28:56.990 --> 28:59.989
Oh!

28:59.990 --> 29:00.290
No!

29:00.291 --> 29:01.989
For you, Bailey.

29:01.990 --> 29:04.989
They tried to take your daddy
out.

29:04.990 --> 29:12.990
Your daddy ain't built like
that.

29:17.410 --> 29:22.989
I thought I was right
( Bleep ) There.

29:22.990 --> 29:23.700
Great.

29:23.701 --> 29:24.989
Super.

29:24.990 --> 29:24.991
Wonderful.

29:24.991 --> 29:25.990
Perfect results.

29:25.991 --> 29:28.989
There is no doubt in my mind
that James is officially gunning

29:28.990 --> 29:29.990
for me.

29:29.991 --> 29:34.989
So I'm terrified that he's the
most likely to win the next

29:34.990 --> 29:37.989
h.O.H., and there's zero doubt
in my mind if he does, I'm going

29:37.990 --> 29:39.989
up on the block.

29:39.990 --> 29:47.990
Well, there goes that plan.

29:52.990 --> 29:54.989
You feel good?

29:54.990 --> 29:59.989
It does feel good like, yeah,
I won it, but it feels right,

29:59.990 --> 30:02.989
like, karma, because we didn't
deserve to go up on the block.

30:02.990 --> 30:06.989
I'm very curious to see who
she puts up.

30:06.990 --> 30:09.989
James winning the power of veto
was the best-case scenario for

30:09.990 --> 30:11.989
the chance for both of us to
stay in the house.

30:11.990 --> 30:15.539
I'm really hoping that Vanessa
realizes I'm not her biggest

30:15.540 --> 30:18.989
threat in the house, and she
find a new target who is a

30:18.990 --> 30:19.990
stronger competitor.

30:19.991 --> 30:23.989
I'm going to try to make a
deal to save you.

30:23.990 --> 30:26.989
Vanessa's a sitting duck next
week.

30:26.990 --> 30:28.989
Now that I have the the power of
veto, Vanessa can't touch me

30:28.990 --> 30:29.990
this week.

30:29.991 --> 30:34.949
I have to come up with a plan so
I can keep Meg safe this week.

30:34.950 --> 30:39.949
I will tell her I won't go after
her from my mouth to her face.

30:39.950 --> 30:45.989
No more playing Mr. nice guy.

30:45.990 --> 30:49.409
Did you shower?

30:49.410 --> 30:50.999
How terrible is it they found
Austin?

30:51.000 --> 30:51.990
I know.

30:51.990 --> 30:52.990
I want to cry.

30:52.991 --> 30:56.539
I teared up when I saw he won.

30:56.540 --> 30:57.989
We were so pissed.

30:57.990 --> 31:03.289
But if you put us up, we'll vote
to, vict Meg.

31:03.290 --> 31:06.989
So what do you... like, you have
to put up John, or, like, would

31:06.990 --> 31:07.990
you put up Steve?

31:07.991 --> 31:10.949
I don't know now.

31:10.950 --> 31:12.989
Finding a replacement nominee
that will ensure that Meg will

31:12.990 --> 31:14.989
have the votes to go to jury is
going to be tough.

31:14.990 --> 31:17.989
Almost anyone who goes up next
to her will be seen as a bigger

31:17.990 --> 31:20.989
threat, and it will be a
compelling reason to flip the

31:20.990 --> 31:21.990
vote on me.

31:21.991 --> 31:24.989
What do I have to confirm that
you guys are going to vote that

31:24.990 --> 31:28.289
way when it's in your interest
to vote out John?

31:28.290 --> 31:29.999
John's coming for you guys, and
Meg sucks.

31:30.000 --> 31:33.989
So you would be stupid to vote
out Meg just because I want you

31:33.990 --> 31:33.991
to.

31:33.991 --> 31:34.990
That's my problem.

31:34.991 --> 31:36.989
I know what's going to happen.

31:36.990 --> 31:38.989
The vote is going to get close,
and the vote will come out and

31:38.990 --> 31:40.989
the vote will flip.

31:40.990 --> 31:41.990
There's no answer.

31:41.991 --> 31:43.289
It's terrible.

31:43.290 --> 31:43.990
It's so bad.

31:43.991 --> 31:45.990
What a terrible ( Bleep )
Result.

31:53.990 --> 32:01.990
Be a fly on the wall inside
the Big Brother house

32:16.950 --> 32:22.989
neck, let it soak in a little
bit.

32:22.990 --> 32:25.289
Right there, baby.

32:25.290 --> 32:29.989
Let that soak in.

32:29.990 --> 32:31.989
Safe.

32:31.990 --> 32:34.409
Are you going to wear that
all day today?

32:34.410 --> 32:36.989
Damn right, damn right.

32:36.990 --> 32:38.989
Someone tried to take me out.

32:38.990 --> 32:43.989
I've been pretty much walking on
eggshells with Vanessa for

32:43.990 --> 32:46.989
70-some-days in this house and
it has done me no good.

32:46.990 --> 32:52.409
Vanessa, you know I ooik to make
big moves so I'll tell you.

32:52.410 --> 32:56.989
I'll tell Vanessa straight up to
her face if I win h.O.H., her

32:56.990 --> 32:58.989
ass is going up on the block,
period.

32:58.990 --> 33:00.989
I don't care who tells her.

33:00.990 --> 33:03.989
She put me up twice, and she
targeted me and her over some

33:03.990 --> 33:05.989
bull this week and I'm tired of
it.

33:05.990 --> 33:10.989
I just don't want you guys to
feel like I played you.

33:10.990 --> 33:13.989
Look, you gotta protect your
girl.

33:13.990 --> 33:16.999
And I'm trying to protect... I
mean, we're not showmance or

33:17.000 --> 33:25.000
nothing, but...
>> I'm your queen.

33:27.990 --> 33:35.990
Ht I had it.

33:36.990 --> 33:38.989
I hope you know I tried my
hardest.

33:38.990 --> 33:39.990
I saw.

33:39.990 --> 33:39.991
I saw.

33:39.991 --> 33:43.989
Look, they already tried to
talk to me.

33:43.990 --> 33:44.990
Saying what?

33:44.991 --> 33:47.989
He's definitely going to put
you up.

33:47.990 --> 33:50.409
Basically, he's like I'm going
to have to target her now.

33:50.410 --> 33:50.990
No problem.

33:50.991 --> 33:52.989
The problem is I...
>> yeah.

33:52.990 --> 33:57.409
Am completely... this is... I'm
( Bleep ).

33:57.410 --> 33:58.989
Because I have to get rid of
Meg.

33:58.990 --> 33:59.410
Okay.

33:59.411 --> 34:00.539
She has to go.

34:00.540 --> 34:03.989
The fact that James is down
there throwing my name out boils

34:03.990 --> 34:04.990
my blood.

34:04.991 --> 34:08.949
You think I'm going to keep Meg
in the game now and make you

34:08.950 --> 34:08.990
stronger.

34:08.991 --> 34:13.829
No I'm going to take a shot and
take out your you in mereo dos.

34:13.830 --> 34:15.989
Don't kill yourself about it
it because it's over.

34:15.990 --> 34:16.990
Why did I find yours?

34:16.991 --> 34:18.989
It is the irony of it all.

34:18.990 --> 34:20.289
Make lemonade out of it.

34:20.290 --> 34:28.290
Find will best possible
scenario.

34:33.990 --> 34:35.699
I'm ( Bleep ).

34:35.700 --> 34:37.119
You have no idea.

34:37.120 --> 34:39.829
I can't even, like, function
right now.

34:39.830 --> 34:42.539
So I just realized I'm
( Bleep ).

34:42.540 --> 34:44.539
All the the ( Bleep ) Way
around.

34:44.540 --> 34:48.989
He's the last person that
should have won that.

34:48.990 --> 34:50.949
When in doubt, drink.

34:50.950 --> 34:50.990
Yes.

34:50.991 --> 34:56.989
James winning the veto this
week is an enormous problem for

34:56.990 --> 34:56.991
me.

34:56.991 --> 35:02.409
Now I have to find a replacement
nominee and there are only five

35:02.410 --> 35:06.989
options all of whom I'm working
with in the house.

35:06.990 --> 35:09.989
I'm justice going to put it out
there, and honestly, these are

35:09.990 --> 35:13.989
the only options I have, and I
respect you all enough.

35:13.990 --> 35:17.999
If I put up Liz or Austin,
they're too big of targets, the

35:18.000 --> 35:19.989
only feasible option is you.

35:19.990 --> 35:20.990
Here would be the logic.

35:20.991 --> 35:23.989
You know they're never going to
vote against you.

35:23.990 --> 35:25.989
You know would have the vote.

35:25.990 --> 35:29.989
How would you feel about that?

35:29.990 --> 35:33.949
I feel like I'm a huge
target, too because I feel like

35:33.950 --> 35:35.829
everyone wants to get me and Liz
out.

35:35.830 --> 35:36.830
We're a three-some.

35:36.831 --> 35:38.989
They want to break up the
three-some.

35:38.990 --> 35:41.409
Every time Meg has gone on
the block, she stays.

35:41.410 --> 35:45.989
But the problem is, Meg gives
James, who is a very strong

35:45.990 --> 35:46.990
competitor, a vote.

35:46.990 --> 35:46.991
Right.

35:46.991 --> 35:48.989
He's so much more powerful
with her.

35:48.990 --> 35:49.700
Yes.

35:49.701 --> 35:51.289
As a group I want to decide.

35:51.290 --> 35:55.989
I just want you ton if the
target is Meg, the only option

35:55.990 --> 35:58.289
that is smart is you as a pawn.

35:58.290 --> 36:01.989
Unfortunately, that's only way I
guarantee Meg goes.

36:01.990 --> 36:04.989
You and your sister...
>> we've won too many comps.

36:04.990 --> 36:06.989
And Steve could get flipped.

36:06.990 --> 36:09.949
Whereas Steve won't get flipped
if it's you on the block.

36:09.950 --> 36:12.989
Who are you more afraid of
winning h.O.H. Next week, Johnny

36:12.990 --> 36:13.950
Mac or Meg?

36:13.951 --> 36:14.989
Obviously, Johnny Mac.

36:14.990 --> 36:17.409
Okay, I'm not scared of Meg
at all.

36:17.410 --> 36:19.539
I can beat her in anything and
everything.

36:19.540 --> 36:22.989
Johnny Mac I cannot say the
same.

36:22.990 --> 36:24.989
I'm really in a tough spot.

36:24.990 --> 36:27.989
Austin and the twins are not
letting up about Johnny Mac

36:27.990 --> 36:30.409
being the replacement nominee.

36:30.410 --> 36:33.949
However, I have a side deal they
know nothing about with Johnny,

36:33.950 --> 36:36.989
and I can't let them realize I
really want Johnny to stay in

36:36.990 --> 36:37.540
the game.

36:37.541 --> 36:41.989
Do you guys think you can
guarantee that you will beat Meg

36:41.990 --> 36:44.119
in an intellectual comp.

36:44.120 --> 36:44.990
110%.

36:44.991 --> 36:50.289
Her performance up until to
you is is...

36:50.290 --> 36:52.829
when is Meg going to go home?

36:52.830 --> 36:53.989
She will float to the finals.

36:53.990 --> 36:56.539
How are we going to take it her
out?

36:56.540 --> 37:00.989
I have made it abundantly clear
that Meg is my target but the

37:00.990 --> 37:03.989
pressure Austin and the twins
are putting on me is questioning

37:03.990 --> 37:05.829
me to question my decision.

37:05.830 --> 37:09.539
I say you put up Johnny Mac
and we play a real good social

37:09.540 --> 37:16.949
game with the the people that
remain this week.

37:16.950 --> 37:18.409
Well, here we go.

37:18.410 --> 37:20.989
The more I've been thinking
about it, I'm going to have to

37:20.990 --> 37:22.989
talk to Vanessa for Meg's sake.

37:22.990 --> 37:25.989
I don't want to really do it,
but I'm going to have to, if I

37:25.990 --> 37:28.989
ever want to give mepg a
fighting chance to pull herself

37:28.990 --> 37:32.989
off that block.

37:32.990 --> 37:33.540
Block.

37:33.540 --> 37:33.990
Come in.

37:33.990 --> 37:33.991
What's up?

37:33.991 --> 37:36.829
I just wanted to hash things
out with you.

37:36.830 --> 37:38.989
All righty.

37:38.990 --> 37:41.989
I will just warn you, I'm just
letting you know, I'm not in the

37:41.990 --> 37:42.990
best mood.

37:42.991 --> 37:47.989
I just wanted to know where
me and you stand at right now?

37:47.990 --> 37:51.989
The thing I'm trying to wrap my
head around is, like...

37:51.990 --> 37:53.949
do I have something personal
with you?

37:53.950 --> 37:53.990
Right.

37:53.991 --> 37:56.989
Listen, we could have worked
together, but for whatever

37:56.990 --> 37:59.989
reason it never happened, and
now there are just so few people

37:59.990 --> 38:01.699
my options were very limited.

38:01.700 --> 38:04.289
I thought of all people you
understood it was just a game.

38:04.290 --> 38:04.990
Right.

38:04.991 --> 38:06.989
I never had anything personal
with you until people came up

38:06.990 --> 38:11.539
and told me that you're saying,
"I'm definitely... " I fully

38:11.540 --> 38:11.990
expect to be the target.

38:11.991 --> 38:15.989
I would have expect you of all
people to tell me rather than

38:15.990 --> 38:16.990
tell everyone else.

38:16.991 --> 38:19.989
I thing sidon't read into the
game like you do.

38:19.990 --> 38:23.949
You remember every little piece
and you hold on to what it is.

38:23.950 --> 38:25.999
And you're trying to play a game
too hard.

38:26.000 --> 38:29.989
When I won an h.O.H. Two people
have to go up.

38:29.990 --> 38:33.989
I don't think there and...
>> are you insulting me right

38:33.990 --> 38:33.991
now?

38:33.991 --> 38:36.989
Are you literally insulting me.

38:36.990 --> 38:36.991
No.

38:36.991 --> 38:40.829
All right, I think it's best
you go downstairs.

38:40.830 --> 38:43.539
You're literally telling me I'm
playing the game too hard.

38:43.540 --> 38:44.989
That's a respect thing.

38:44.990 --> 38:46.989
Are you an expert?

38:46.990 --> 38:48.949
Did you win last season.

38:48.950 --> 38:50.989
Did you want me to say you're
not playing the game.

38:50.990 --> 38:55.119
You said I'm playing too hard
and that's a criticism.

38:55.120 --> 38:57.289
Last time...
>> I'm not trying to come up

38:57.290 --> 38:58.290
here and bash you.

38:58.291 --> 38:59.989
I'm trying to get out what's
going on.

38:59.990 --> 39:03.989
James, there isn't anything
personal before this

39:03.990 --> 39:03.991
conversation.

39:03.991 --> 39:06.119
I don't know what else to tell
you.

39:06.120 --> 39:06.990
You're safe this week.

39:06.991 --> 39:10.119
You want to make it clear how
much of an enemy I am, all that

39:10.120 --> 39:14.989
does is incentivize me to send
your number one home which is

39:14.990 --> 39:14.991
Meg.

39:14.991 --> 39:16.989
So you're going to take it
out on me.

39:16.990 --> 39:18.990
Your locking her fate up

39:50.000 --> 39:51.989
in the hands of Vanessa.

39:51.990 --> 39:52.999
I'm feeling really nervous.

39:53.000 --> 39:56.989
I have no idea what she's about
to do.

39:56.990 --> 40:02.989
You never know with Vanessa.

40:02.990 --> 40:06.989
James winning the veto this
week was the least favorable

40:06.990 --> 40:07.700
situation for me.

40:07.701 --> 40:10.949
It leaves Meg up on the block
and leaves me finding a

40:10.950 --> 40:13.989
replacement nominee that ensures
she goes home, and that's a

40:13.990 --> 40:14.990
tough thing to do.

40:14.991 --> 40:16.989
So there has to be a
replacement nominee.

40:16.990 --> 40:17.990
That's a fact.

40:17.991 --> 40:20.989
And there are definitely people
in this house that want me out

40:20.990 --> 40:23.989
so if I go up as a replacement
nominee there's a good chance

40:23.990 --> 40:30.989
I'm going back out the door to
jury.

40:30.990 --> 40:38.990
Okay, everybody, it's time
for the veto meeting.

40:47.990 --> 40:50.119
This is the veto meeting.

40:50.120 --> 40:53.989
Meg and I have been nominated
for eviction, but I have the

40:53.990 --> 40:58.989
power to veto one of the
nominations.

40:58.990 --> 41:00.989
Meg, I think you're an awesome
girl.

41:00.990 --> 41:05.989
With that being said, I have
decided to use the power of veto

41:05.990 --> 41:09.989
on myself.

41:09.990 --> 41:13.989
Vanessa, since I just vetoed one
of your nominations for

41:13.990 --> 41:16.989
eviction, you will have to name
a new houseguest as a

41:16.990 --> 41:21.950
replacement nominee.

41:22.990 --> 41:25.989
First and foremost, I want to
congratulate you, James.

41:25.990 --> 41:28.989
That was a really tough veto
competition.

41:28.990 --> 41:28.991
Job well done.

41:28.991 --> 41:29.990
Thank you.

41:29.991 --> 41:33.989
As far as finding a
replacement nominee, guys, this

41:33.990 --> 41:35.989
is unbelievably difficult.

41:35.990 --> 41:39.989
There are only five other
potential options for me, and I

41:39.990 --> 41:42.989
have to do the option that I
feel is the best game move.

41:42.990 --> 41:45.989
And that's all this comes down
to.

41:45.990 --> 41:53.990
So, unfortunately, Julia, please
take a seat.

42:00.990 --> 42:08.990
This veto meeting is adjourned.

42:09.990 --> 42:13.989
I put Julia up as the
replacement nominee because Meg

42:13.990 --> 42:14.990
has absolutely got to go.

42:14.991 --> 42:18.989
Her number one Ally James made
it extremely clear this week I'm

42:18.990 --> 42:21.989
his number one target going into
next week and why would I leave

42:21.990 --> 42:24.989
his number one Ally in the game
if he's targeting me.

42:24.990 --> 42:28.989
It makes me extremely nervous
being next to Meg on the block.

42:28.990 --> 42:31.989
Every time someone's been on the
block with her, they've been

42:31.990 --> 42:32.830
sent packing.

42:32.831 --> 42:37.989
So I really got to do what I
gotta do to stay in this house.

42:37.990 --> 42:40.989
This is the first time one of
the twingz of twins has been up

42:40.990 --> 42:42.989
on the block for eviction night.

42:42.990 --> 42:47.949
If I could pull strings in this
house, we could finally break up

42:47.950 --> 42:49.829
the Austin-twin trio.

42:49.830 --> 42:51.989
They're a huge threat this this
game and need to be taken out.

42:51.990 --> 42:54.989
Who will be evicted from the
"Big Brother" house, Julia or

42:54.990 --> 42:57.989
?Eg plus, it's a special double
eviction episode.

42:57.990 --> 43:02.949
It's a week's worth of "big
brother" in one hour.

43:02.950 --> 43:08.989
It all happens live tomorrow at
9:00, 8:00 central o"big

43:08.990 --> 43:11.120
brother."
