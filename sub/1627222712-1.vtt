00:10.510 --> 00:12.763
Ma'am, are you still there?

00:13.263 --> 00:15.015
Yes.

00:15.098 --> 00:16.683
What is your location?

00:17.226 --> 00:20.395
I'm in... in my house, and he's...

00:23.190 --> 00:24.191
Ma'am?

00:28.862 --> 00:30.822
Ma'am? What is your location?

00:30.906 --> 00:33.158
Please! Please! No! Please!

00:37.704 --> 00:39.081
Ma'am?

00:40.624 --> 00:41.875
Ma'am!

00:45.170 --> 00:47.839
Ma'am, are you still there?

03:13.402 --> 03:15.487
A normal-sized gun
would've done the exact same job.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.406
Please stop talking.

03:17.489 --> 03:20.325
You're telling me you wouldn't prefer
just a nice, clean overdose?

03:20.409 --> 03:22.536
It's a Tuesday afternoon,
for Christ's sake.

03:22.619 --> 03:25.664
Guys, can we please focus?
We're already running behind. Come on.

03:25.747 --> 03:27.958
Got some protein ready for disposal.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.252
Teeth.

03:32.003 --> 03:33.463
The guy used a gun that size

03:33.547 --> 03:36.258
knowing he was gonna
put a Jackson Pollock on the wall.

03:36.341 --> 03:38.802
All I'm saying is
that's kind of a douche move.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.470
You can't call a dead man a douche.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.597
- Why not?
- Because it's insensitive.

03:43.974 --> 03:45.851
Uh, morning, ma'am.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.436
The inside of the house is clean.

03:47.519 --> 03:48.770
Sorry about that.

03:48.854 --> 03:51.189
Is this... I don't know,
is this funny to you?

03:51.273 --> 03:54.025
You get off
joking about people's tragedies?

03:54.109 --> 03:55.736
No. No, not at all.

03:55.819 --> 03:57.779
Oh, no? So you're just an asshole?

03:58.905 --> 04:00.031
Or do you prefer douche?

04:00.115 --> 04:03.368
Okay, why don't I take you on a walk
to sign off on everything, okay?

04:03.452 --> 04:04.870
After you.

04:04.953 --> 04:06.997
Just want to confirm
that is your current address

04:07.080 --> 04:08.957
- in case we have to get a hold of you.
- Yes.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.751
- Okay, last one.
- Thank you for your help.

04:10.834 --> 04:11.835
You're welcome.

04:11.918 --> 04:14.254
And again,
I apologize for my team's behavior.

04:14.337 --> 04:17.339
We really are sorry for your loss.
Thank you for choosing us.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.134
Let's hope it's a one-off.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.284
Hello?

04:44.367 --> 04:47.245
- Are you sitting down?
- Uh, kind of.

04:47.329 --> 04:48.872
We have an interested financier.

04:48.955 --> 04:51.041
- You're kidding.
- I am beyond busy.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.334
I don't have time for humor.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.880
Oh, my God! Who? When? Where?

04:56.963 --> 04:59.216
Lead investor's
finishing up a deal on the East Coast.

04:59.299 --> 05:02.761
You have a meeting
at the end of the month. 29th, 3:00 p.m.

05:02.844 --> 05:04.888
- Oh, gotta go.
- Bye.

05:06.681 --> 05:08.391
Oh, my God.

05:14.689 --> 05:16.483
Need a ride?

05:17.692 --> 05:19.319
Do guys really think that works?

05:19.986 --> 05:22.656
Oh, no, seriously, like,
"Ah, he whistled at me.

05:22.739 --> 05:27.077
He must be a really nice guy
and, wow, he drives a Toyota?

05:27.160 --> 05:29.204
I gotta jump on that ship right now."

05:29.287 --> 05:30.705
Yeah, maybe.

05:30.789 --> 05:33.792
Well, so you know, I am on my way
to surprise my husband.

05:34.543 --> 05:36.211
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

05:36.294 --> 05:38.004
What's the surprise?

05:38.088 --> 05:40.590
Oh, you know, not something insane.
It's just...

05:40.674 --> 05:43.843
I might've found an investor to get
my brick and mortar store running.

05:44.844 --> 05:47.347
Are you serious?
Let's get you home.

05:49.766 --> 05:51.393
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.655
I don't know how to say this nicely,
but you're...

06:03.738 --> 06:05.699
You're kinda crowding me
just a little bit.

06:05.782 --> 06:08.159
- You're such a jerk.
- Stop.

06:08.243 --> 06:09.286
Stop trying...

06:09.369 --> 06:11.288
Oh, whoa.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.956
- I'm sorry.
- Easy! Watch the boys.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.417
- It was an accident, I promise.
- Yeah, right.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.419
- Hey.
- What?

06:17.627 --> 06:20.213
Do me a favor.
Don't leave me in the dust, all right?

06:20.297 --> 06:21.923
Shut up.

06:22.299 --> 06:25.343
And, you know,
it's still a maybe. I don't know.

06:25.802 --> 06:28.680
You're too good for this not to work out.
You know that, right?

06:54.706 --> 06:56.207
I can't do this.

07:06.843 --> 07:09.012
How are things
going for you, Kevin?

07:09.095 --> 07:10.764
I'm not even mad anymore.

07:12.057 --> 07:14.184
Honestly, I... I just feel numb.

07:15.936 --> 07:19.230
It's not about the affair,
it's about betrayal.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.030
You give your whole life to somebody

07:27.113 --> 07:29.240
and they're only
giving you half of theirs?

07:29.824 --> 07:31.785
And the whole time, you have no idea.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.999
And how's it going
in the romantic department?

07:43.046 --> 07:48.718
In the aftermath of an affair,
room is made for a new kind of truth.

07:49.094 --> 07:52.847
A new kind of understanding
and communication.

07:52.931 --> 07:57.560
But you cannot sit in ruin,
waiting for it to rebuild itself.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.355
Have you considered
a change of environment?

08:01.272 --> 08:04.192
Uh, of course.
I mean, that would be ideal.

08:04.275 --> 08:07.112
Excellent. The truth of the matter is...

08:07.737 --> 08:10.365
Your first marriage is over.

08:11.116 --> 08:13.034
Can we all agree on that?

08:15.620 --> 08:16.913
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.666
Now you need
to ask yourselves,

08:19.749 --> 08:24.462
would you like to create
a second one together...

08:29.718 --> 08:31.094
And take action?

08:31.928 --> 08:33.221
Make the change.

08:34.806 --> 08:38.393
Give yourselves
the gift of a new environment.

08:41.229 --> 08:44.607
I mean, she's right.
Your first marriage is kinda shot to shit.

08:45.442 --> 08:47.485
What? I'm just being honest...

08:47.569 --> 08:50.655
Which sounds like the missing link here,
so you're welcome.

08:50.739 --> 08:53.283
I'm just terrified
that he's never gonna forgive me.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.784
You fucked up, sure,

08:54.909 --> 08:58.038
but you know, he's not the only victim
in this situation.

08:58.121 --> 09:00.749
I know you won't say this
'cause you'd rather take the blame.

09:00.832 --> 09:02.042
- I'll say it for you.
- Don't.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.460
Your needs weren't being met.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.295
I can't use that as an excuse.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.964
It's not an excuse, it's reality.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.008
Look, I have a deadline here, okay?

09:10.091 --> 09:11.760
I can't go back and forth about this.

09:11.843 --> 09:13.595
- He pulled away from you, Nat.
- Yeah.

09:13.678 --> 09:16.264
Well, I think that
anyone who found their brother

09:16.347 --> 09:18.975
hanging in a closet
would've done the same thing.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.479
- Come on, Natalie.
- Can you just hand me the floral print?

09:26.483 --> 09:28.860
Hey what are you doing home already?

09:28.943 --> 09:30.945
I just finished early today.

09:32.030 --> 09:33.823
Not interrupting anything, am I?

09:33.907 --> 09:35.492
No, no. Not at all.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.786
- Hey, Dani.
- How's it going?

09:41.164 --> 09:42.624
Oh, uh, shit. You know what?

09:42.707 --> 09:45.001
I gotta... I gotta go. I got work stuff.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.796
- I'll text you later.
- Okay.

09:47.879 --> 09:49.089
See you.

09:52.509 --> 09:55.470
Uh, I want to run something past you.
You have a minute?

09:56.638 --> 09:57.806
Are you fucking insane?

09:57.889 --> 10:00.850
No I'm trying to heed the advice
that we've been paying for.

10:02.227 --> 10:03.686
Take a look at the house.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.105
- No, thank you.
- Look.

10:05.188 --> 10:07.857
I talked to the owner.
She's gonna give us a great price.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.026
You already talked to the owner?

10:11.152 --> 10:12.237
Well, yeah.

10:13.071 --> 10:15.490
I'm taking action.
Isn't that what I'm supposed to do?

10:15.573 --> 10:17.951
Why would you talk to someone
about buying a house

10:18.034 --> 10:20.120
before even asking me. That's not...

10:20.203 --> 10:22.080
You don't understand
This place is perfect.

10:22.163 --> 10:23.456
It's disturbing.

10:23.540 --> 10:26.334
I promise you wouldn't be able
to tell what happened there.

10:26.417 --> 10:27.877
I know. I cleaned it, myself.

10:27.961 --> 10:31.089
I don't want to move into a house
where there was a murder-suicide.

10:31.172 --> 10:34.592
It was unfortunate what happened.
Okay. But shit happens every day.

10:34.676 --> 10:36.427
Are you really being
that cavalier about it?

10:36.511 --> 10:39.305
We live in the the 21st century, Natalie.

10:39.389 --> 10:41.015
Wherever we move, there'll be history,

10:41.099 --> 10:43.351
and I'm willing to bet
that it's not gonna be great.

10:43.434 --> 10:47.105
- Domestic abuse, child pornography...
- Please. I don't want to move into a house

10:47.188 --> 10:49.440
where I'm haunted
by the image of someone's brains

10:49.524 --> 10:52.110
being splattered
all over the living room wall.

10:54.696 --> 10:57.740
Well, I don't want to sleep in a bed
where I have to relive my wife

10:57.824 --> 10:59.409
sucking another guy's dick.

11:04.873 --> 11:06.916
You stopped helping yourself.

11:07.375 --> 11:08.710
You dropped out of college.

11:08.793 --> 11:11.713
You wouldn't talk to me.
Let alone go anywhere near me.

11:13.339 --> 11:17.093
I had a moment of weakness,
and I hate myself for that.

11:18.887 --> 11:20.972
But you cannot keep punishing me.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.937
I know.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.775
I'm going to sleep on the couch, okay?

11:48.124 --> 11:49.334
Hey.

11:49.584 --> 11:50.668
Hey.

11:53.421 --> 11:55.840
It... it has to have a home office.

11:59.385 --> 12:00.428
Okay.

12:01.512 --> 12:05.975
And we're really gonna
have to cut back on our expenses.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.227
At least until this deal goes through.

12:09.020 --> 12:10.355
I can do that.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.400
And you have to go back to college.

12:16.527 --> 12:19.322
Kevin, I can't watch you
throw your life away anymore.

12:24.327 --> 12:25.411
Okay.

12:27.330 --> 12:28.498
Promise me.

12:31.542 --> 12:32.752
I promise.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.297
Okay.

12:49.227 --> 12:50.228
Wow.

12:53.815 --> 12:56.025
Thanks again
for walking through with us.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.860
We know this is not easy for you.

12:57.944 --> 12:58.820
Of course.

12:58.903 --> 13:00.238
Hey what is that, right there?

13:01.072 --> 13:02.949
Oh, remote locks.

13:03.032 --> 13:06.035
There's an app
that you can link your phones to.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.912
Wow! I didn't even know that was a thing.

13:07.996 --> 13:10.581
Yeah, you're going to find
a lot of that stuff here.

13:10.665 --> 13:14.377
Um, there were some technical difficulties
here and there with the cameras.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.296
I... I guess you would
have to call the company to set it up.

13:18.172 --> 13:19.590
As you guys already know,

13:19.674 --> 13:21.926
my brother and his wife
designed everything here,

13:22.010 --> 13:25.430
so you're gonna get
a lot of expensive extras at a low cost.

13:26.097 --> 13:29.267
- Um, guys, wait till you see outside.
- Yeah.

13:29.934 --> 13:33.813
Whoa! I mean it pretty much
speaks for itself.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.606
Wow.

13:37.233 --> 13:40.653
I know that this is not
an ideal situation for anyone,

13:40.737 --> 13:45.116
but this back yard
and the closet space, right?

13:46.576 --> 13:49.579
Look, Claudia,
we're obviously very interested,

13:49.662 --> 13:52.457
but I'll be honest with you.
It's been a rough couple of years.

13:52.540 --> 13:54.208
I know it's not what you offered.

13:55.334 --> 13:57.086
But it's what we can afford.

13:57.628 --> 14:01.466
If you can say yes to that number,
we can sign the paperwork today.

14:05.470 --> 14:07.013
We really need a fresh start.

14:08.014 --> 14:10.141
Please, let's talk about this.

14:12.935 --> 14:14.103
The truth is,

14:14.187 --> 14:16.397
we haven't had a prospective buyer
in months.

14:17.190 --> 14:20.651
I don't know, I guess
people scare off easily these days.

14:22.737 --> 14:24.364
Add another 20k and it's yours.

14:24.447 --> 14:25.865
Yes! Yes!

14:25.948 --> 14:28.868
Oh, my God, you have no idea
how much this means to us.

14:28.951 --> 14:31.037
We're just as happy
to have it off our hands.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.539
And I know that you guys
will be really happy here.

14:34.957 --> 14:36.417
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

14:36.501 --> 14:38.252
Thank you so much.

14:38.336 --> 14:39.170
Thanks, man.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.508
- Enjoy the house.
- Oh, Robert.

14:45.635 --> 14:48.679
- Oh, my God.
- Yes, we just bought a house.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.899
Well, Odi loves it.

15:01.984 --> 15:04.237
So? It's beautiful, right?

15:04.529 --> 15:06.239
It's something.

15:06.322 --> 15:08.366
So that's where he killed her?

15:09.283 --> 15:11.619
Ugh! So creepy.

15:12.537 --> 15:13.704
Thank you.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.541
Please, I am just
pointing out the obvious.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.710
Nice plot of land.

15:19.794 --> 15:21.712
Perfect for burying murder victims.

15:28.386 --> 15:31.764
Are you, uh, sure this is a good decision?

15:33.224 --> 15:35.852
Just seems like a lot
to go through to get laid, that's all.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.146
Okay, well,
in case you didn't notice

15:38.229 --> 15:41.732
the moving boxes you helped carry in,
it's a little late for that.

15:41.816 --> 15:45.153
As mom or Gandhi would say,
"It's never too late."

15:45.236 --> 15:48.281
Uh, Gandhi never said that,
and mom is an idiot.

15:49.323 --> 15:52.160
You know, that is very harsh,
on both parties.

15:53.828 --> 15:55.121
Dead body!

15:55.204 --> 15:57.206
I called it!

16:08.926 --> 16:10.803
Oh, that is all you.

16:41.667 --> 16:42.919
Oh, Jesus.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.797
- Is that where he pulled her out from?
- Dani, stop!

16:49.509 --> 16:51.427
You know, it's her own fault,
hiding in a closet

16:51.511 --> 16:52.929
instead of using the front door.

16:54.805 --> 16:55.973
What?

16:56.057 --> 16:58.351
All right, come on, you little freak.

17:07.902 --> 17:10.655
Oh! Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry, baby! Are you okay?

17:10.738 --> 17:12.031
I don't know. Is it bleeding?

17:12.114 --> 17:14.700
No. What the hell were you doing?

17:14.784 --> 17:17.118
- I was joking!
- It's not funny!

17:27.380 --> 17:28.548
It's your turn.

17:28.631 --> 17:30.967
I can't hear you. I'm fast asleep.

17:31.050 --> 17:35.096
- No.
- No. No. No, I don't want to.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.473
Okay, okay, okay.

17:41.018 --> 17:42.520
Come on, Odi.

17:42.770 --> 17:44.564
Let's go. Come on. Come on.

17:52.363 --> 17:53.990
Come on, Odi. Inside.

17:58.494 --> 18:00.162
There's nothing left to pee on.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.417
Odi, come on. Let's go.

18:07.712 --> 18:09.505
Odi, come on. You're killing me.

18:14.051 --> 18:15.469
Hey, shh!

18:16.178 --> 18:17.847
All right, fine. Stay. I'm going to bed.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.948
Jesus. What?
Why are you looking at me like that?

18:37.533 --> 18:38.993
Did you just use the bathroom?

18:39.076 --> 18:41.787
No, but Odi did.
He took his sweet-ass time, too.

18:41.871 --> 18:43.706
Kevin, someone is in the bathroom.

18:43.914 --> 18:44.915
What?

18:44.999 --> 18:46.876
Someone came in here
and went to the bathroom.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.419
I thought it was you.

19:35.966 --> 19:36.967
Kevin?

19:44.809 --> 19:46.519
No. There's nobody in here.

19:49.897 --> 19:51.524
That's not possible.

19:51.607 --> 19:54.110
He'd have to be pretty skinny
for me to miss him.

20:07.331 --> 20:08.999
You have to sleep.

20:09.083 --> 20:11.836
It's our first night here.
Don't spook yourself out.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.295
Let's go to bed.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.756
- Fine.
- Thank you.

20:33.482 --> 20:34.483
What the fuck?

20:36.444 --> 20:39.447
I'm not mad about it.
I just didn't pay for it.

20:39.530 --> 20:40.948
So, if it's free, I'll keep it.

20:41.031 --> 20:42.658
What do you mean you can't refund it?

20:42.742 --> 20:44.952
- I didn't order it.
- Have you seen my keys anywhere?

20:45.035 --> 20:47.955
Yeah, it's my name and my address,
but I personally didn't order it.

20:48.038 --> 20:50.750
- Kevin. Kevin, keys.
- I have to call you back.

20:50.833 --> 20:53.544
Hey, where was the last place you had 'em?

20:53.627 --> 20:56.630
My desk, but I've searched
the entire office, and they're not there.

20:56.714 --> 20:59.133
Right. So that's probably not
the last place you had them.

20:59.216 --> 21:01.260
Hmm. You know what?
I never really thought of that.

21:01.343 --> 21:04.305
It's amazing how some people could really
put it into perspective for you.

21:04.388 --> 21:05.931
Hey.

21:08.434 --> 21:12.563
I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm late, and
I slept like shit and I look like shit.

21:12.646 --> 21:14.064
Babe, you look beautiful.

21:14.815 --> 21:16.609
And you are gonna do great today.

21:20.488 --> 21:23.824
Okay, that, truly not what it looks like.

21:23.908 --> 21:25.451
Don't to be ashamed.
It's a magazine.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.328
It's weird, 'cause you have the Internet.

21:27.411 --> 21:28.871
- Can we look for your keys?
- Yes.

21:29.830 --> 21:32.875
Look, I told you,
I already excavated the entire place.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.043
It's not there.

21:36.962 --> 21:39.632
I swear to God I checked there.

21:39.715 --> 21:42.927
Well, maybe God's just having an off day
and he's trying to fuck with you.

21:43.010 --> 21:45.429
- Don't you have some porn to go look at?
- I love you.

21:45.513 --> 21:46.806
I love you, too.

21:46.889 --> 21:50.100
Oh, um, I know you have a crazy day
between work and class,

21:50.184 --> 21:52.561
so I packed your lunch.
It's in the fridge. Blue lid.

21:53.437 --> 21:55.731
Okay. Go on, get lost.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.358
- Bye.
- Bye.

22:11.080 --> 22:15.125
My youngest daughter, God love her,
is an absolute nightmare.

22:15.209 --> 22:17.336
- Thank you.
- Especially when it comes to wardrobe.

22:18.838 --> 22:21.257
The amount of gifts
that I've had to return

22:21.340 --> 22:23.759
could clothe an entire
Third World country.

22:24.552 --> 22:27.596
She's worn three of your samples
in the last week.

22:28.514 --> 22:34.103
I think you have a really good eye
for color, and texture, and quality.

22:34.186 --> 22:37.856
A female entrepreneur.
An intelligent one of that.

22:37.940 --> 22:41.569
Before opening up your own location,

22:41.652 --> 22:45.573
we'd like to establish you
as a brand name.

22:46.657 --> 22:47.700
Is that an offer?

22:47.783 --> 22:52.580
We can have you in anywhere
between 150 and 250 stores

22:52.663 --> 22:53.872
by the end of the season.

22:53.956 --> 22:55.165
Is this the part where I leave

22:55.249 --> 22:57.710
and pretend to think about it,
or can I just accept now?

22:57.793 --> 22:59.837
- No, you can wait.
- No, I would love to.

22:59.920 --> 23:01.255
- Great!
- Thank you.

23:01.338 --> 23:03.090
- Can I hug you?
- Of course.

23:03.173 --> 23:04.925
Thank you so much!

23:05.009 --> 23:06.552
I'm going out of town next week,

23:06.635 --> 23:09.179
but my associate will be handling
the preliminary process.

23:09.263 --> 23:10.389
Okay.

23:21.483 --> 23:26.447
I want you to modernize the structure
using the original foundation.

23:26.530 --> 23:27.865
Guess what? You get to pair up.

23:27.948 --> 23:30.075
Yes. So, look around. Find a partner.

23:30.159 --> 23:32.494
Someone that's probably smarter than you.

23:32.578 --> 23:34.204
You might actually learn something.

23:35.497 --> 23:39.460
Take this seriously.
This is half of your grade.

23:39.543 --> 23:41.962
Don't procrastinate.
Check in with each other.

23:42.046 --> 23:44.465
Meet up at a coffee shop, go to a house.

23:44.548 --> 23:49.053
I don't care. If you need help, email me.
Don't call. I won't answer.

23:51.347 --> 23:52.681
You again?

23:52.765 --> 23:55.351
Yes, me.
I'm stalking you, didn't you know?

23:55.434 --> 23:56.685
Yeah, I kinda figured.

23:56.769 --> 24:00.898
- So, Kevin?
- So, Avery?

24:03.567 --> 24:05.694
Oh, that's a little presumptuous.

24:06.487 --> 24:10.240
Okay, well, we're partners now,
so I have to be able to reach you.

24:10.324 --> 24:14.328
- Thank you for making it super weird.
- There you go.

24:15.704 --> 24:19.083
All right, Kevin, I'll see you in class.

24:19.166 --> 24:21.794
Don't worry, because this is going to be

24:21.877 --> 24:25.673
the single fucking greatest
class project of all time.

24:25.756 --> 24:26.840
- Just saying.
- Okay.

24:26.924 --> 24:28.217
History of mankind.

24:30.427 --> 24:32.096
Uh...

24:34.098 --> 24:36.809
All right, if this is all to show me
Odi's vomit again, I swear...

24:36.892 --> 24:39.228
Okay, shut it. You're ruining the moment.

24:40.771 --> 24:42.064
Oh, my God.

24:43.357 --> 24:44.692
Wow!

24:45.192 --> 24:46.902
- Who's the lucky lady?
- Mmm.

24:54.910 --> 24:57.496
Um, who, me?

24:57.579 --> 24:59.581
- 'Sup?
- "'Sup?"

24:59.665 --> 25:01.792
Never mind.

25:01.875 --> 25:04.044
I'm going to hang with Odi.
At least he appreciates me.

25:04.128 --> 25:06.046
- No, no, no. I appreciate you.
- Yeah, right.

25:06.130 --> 25:07.381
I do.

25:07.464 --> 25:09.216
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Come here.

25:09.299 --> 25:12.052
I just figured that if they offered you
a deal, we could celebrate,

25:12.136 --> 25:14.930
and if it's wrong and they didn't,
then we can just get drunk.

25:15.013 --> 25:16.014
Forget about it.

25:23.564 --> 25:24.815
- Mmm.
- Ah.

25:24.898 --> 25:27.526
God! You have no idea
how badly I needed that.

25:27.609 --> 25:29.486
I'm proud of you, Nat.

25:29.570 --> 25:32.281
And not just because
you chugged that whole thing.

25:33.240 --> 25:35.993
But you really deserve this.

27:44.288 --> 27:45.372
Kev?

29:52.791 --> 29:55.502
Hey, you okay?

29:55.585 --> 29:57.546
Yeah. Yeah.

29:58.672 --> 30:00.132
It's just, um...

30:00.590 --> 30:02.968
- Just a bad dream.
- Hmm.

30:03.051 --> 30:05.762
You know, I was thinking about tonight.

30:05.846 --> 30:08.807
- Yeah?
- It was really nice.

30:08.890 --> 30:12.102
I missed the way you sound.

30:12.185 --> 30:15.564
Yeah, me, too.

30:19.401 --> 30:21.069
Especially when I do this.

31:45.487 --> 31:47.280
I'm gonna miss you today.

31:48.448 --> 31:49.616
- Oh, really?
- Mmm-hmm.

31:49.699 --> 31:52.327
That's new.

31:52.411 --> 31:54.413
Well, my meeting is done at 5:00,

31:54.538 --> 31:57.624
so I was thinking maybe
we could grab dinner.

31:57.707 --> 31:59.668
Watch a movie.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.253
I wish. I got called on site.

32:01.962 --> 32:04.131
Oh, I thought you were gonna
cut back on your hours.

32:04.214 --> 32:06.633
Yeah, but I'm trying
to get ahead of the expenses.

32:06.716 --> 32:07.926
Just be smart about it.

32:08.009 --> 32:09.302
Hmm. That's new.

32:09.386 --> 32:12.222
You're a jerk. A very beautiful jerk.

32:12.305 --> 32:14.182
Oh, so I've heard.

32:14.266 --> 32:16.059
- Cocky.
- No.

32:16.143 --> 32:19.020
It's just my way of saying
thank you for the note.

32:20.272 --> 32:21.606
What note?

32:25.360 --> 32:26.361
- Kevin Dadich?
- Yeah.

32:26.445 --> 32:27.737
Sign right here, please?

32:27.821 --> 32:30.198
Okay. What exactly am I signing for?

32:30.282 --> 32:32.993
- Um...
- Okay. Here.

32:33.076 --> 32:35.787
- Thank you. Have a nice day.
- Okay.

32:40.459 --> 32:44.379
They racked up $2,000
worth of porn in your bank account?

32:44.463 --> 32:45.630
- Yeah.
- Wow.

32:45.714 --> 32:50.010
A ghost sighting and identity theft
in one day. That's pretty badass.

32:50.093 --> 32:52.179
- It wasn't a ghost.
- What kind of porn is it?

32:54.306 --> 32:57.309
What? I'm just trying to help.
Maybe I know some people who want it.

32:58.185 --> 32:59.352
Unbelievable.

33:02.397 --> 33:05.484
You know, maybe
it's a paranoid hallucination.

33:05.567 --> 33:06.818
I don't know. Think about it.

33:06.902 --> 33:10.197
Pressure of starting a new business,
the stuff with you guys, the new move.

33:10.280 --> 33:12.073
It is kind of a lot at once.

33:13.617 --> 33:16.745
Dude, are you gonna listen to me
or you're just gonna text?

33:17.579 --> 33:20.665
- Oh, no. I'm gonna text.
- Burn.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.213
Are you serious?

33:26.296 --> 33:28.298
- Who's Avery?
- Nobody.

33:28.381 --> 33:31.218
Some cute girl he shouldn't be texting,
but he is anyway.

33:31.301 --> 33:33.553
Stop.

33:34.471 --> 33:35.972
What? Is that not accurate?

33:36.056 --> 33:37.974
Okay. It's all contained in one room.

33:38.058 --> 33:40.810
- Let's get it cleaned up quickly.
- No. Wait a minute.

33:40.894 --> 33:43.730
Who is she? Where did you meet?
And did you touch bathing suit parts?

33:43.813 --> 33:45.565
No, you aging pervert.

33:45.649 --> 33:47.692
We're meeting up later
to work on some class stuff.

33:47.776 --> 33:49.819
- So the sooner we get done...
- Is she cute?

33:49.903 --> 33:51.279
- Yeah!
- I'm not gonna answer that.

33:51.363 --> 33:53.782
Why not?

33:54.241 --> 33:55.283
Because she's cute.

33:55.367 --> 33:59.454
- No. Because it doesn't matter.
- Sounds like karmic retribution.

33:59.538 --> 34:00.872
Yeah, because she's cute.

34:00.997 --> 34:03.083
Just so you guys know,
things between Natalie and I

34:03.166 --> 34:04.376
have been much better lately.

34:04.459 --> 34:06.628
Yeah, like, much better.

34:06.711 --> 34:09.922
- Aside from the paranoid hallucinations.
- Okay, guys, come on, let's go.

34:10.005 --> 34:12.842
But everything else is so much better.
Oh, it's so better.

34:12.926 --> 34:15.594
- Yeah. Nope. Pass.
- Please.

34:15.679 --> 34:18.974
Dani, I don't have time right now.
I have to get ready for a meeting.

34:19.056 --> 34:21.768
Oh, come on. After everything
I helped you with last year?

34:21.851 --> 34:24.771
Really? You're gonna guilt trip me now?

34:24.853 --> 34:26.481
Only because mom is guilt tripping me.

34:26.565 --> 34:28.650
Besides, I already told her
you're hosting dinner.

34:28.733 --> 34:29.900
What?

34:29.985 --> 34:31.820
Dani, the last time
that mom came into town,

34:31.902 --> 34:33.196
we had to check you into rehab.

34:33.280 --> 34:35.657
If you want to have a relationship
with her, do your thing.

34:35.739 --> 34:38.451
Okay? But I decided a long time ago,
I don't wanna deal with it.

34:38.534 --> 34:40.078
I never ask you for anything.

34:40.161 --> 34:43.248
That is definitely not true. Odi,
I have been playing with you all morning.

34:43.331 --> 34:45.500
She's probably gonna go MIA
again after this anyway.

34:45.583 --> 34:48.878
What is so bad about a slightly
painful dinner every few years?

34:48.962 --> 34:50.045
Fine.

34:52.882 --> 34:54.467
You can bring her here, okay?

34:54.551 --> 34:56.469
But that is as much effort
as I'm putting in.

34:56.553 --> 34:57.804
Okay.

34:57.887 --> 35:00.307
Okay, look, I have to get ready
for this meeting, okay?

35:00.390 --> 35:01.391
Goodbye.

35:04.019 --> 35:06.730
Did you get it stuck?

35:08.189 --> 35:10.108
Oh, yeah, right in the middle.

35:13.486 --> 35:17.240
Okay.

36:19.844 --> 36:22.430
Hi, I'm checking in
under Dadich.

36:22.514 --> 36:24.766
Perfect. The other member
of your party just arrived.

36:24.849 --> 36:26.726
Oh, great. Thank you.

36:30.647 --> 36:32.691
- Hey, stranger.
- Nick.

36:33.733 --> 36:34.818
It's good to see you.

36:36.069 --> 36:37.195
Yeah, you, too.

36:38.113 --> 36:39.698
If you wanna just follow me this way.

36:39.781 --> 36:40.824
Uh, yes. Sorry.

36:40.907 --> 36:43.827
I don't mean to be rude,
but actually have a business meeting, so...

36:43.910 --> 36:45.578
Yeah, I know.

36:48.456 --> 36:49.791
Natalie, wait. Just hear me out.

36:49.874 --> 36:51.543
You know I can't be seeing you right now.

36:51.626 --> 36:54.337
- If Kevin finds out about this...
- It's on me. Okay?

36:54.421 --> 36:56.965
You just tell him that you had no idea
and that's the truth.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.383
Why didn't you tell me?

36:59.676 --> 37:01.344
Because I knew you wouldn't come.

37:02.512 --> 37:05.473
A heads up would've been nice
before I signed the paperwork.

37:05.557 --> 37:08.101
I know. You have every right to be mad.
I get it.

37:08.184 --> 37:11.020
But you're talented, Natalie.

37:11.104 --> 37:13.106
And I'm not letting you
throw away an opportunity

37:13.189 --> 37:16.067
over whatever happened between us.
It's stupid.

37:16.151 --> 37:20.238
Anne really likes you, okay?
All I did was provide the info. That's it.

37:22.449 --> 37:25.660
Will you come inside?
Take the meeting? Please?

37:28.997 --> 37:30.165
Fine.

37:31.583 --> 37:34.586
Fuck it. I'm going in for another shot.
You want one?

37:34.669 --> 37:35.754
No, I'm good.

37:35.837 --> 37:38.047
You sure? It's a 100% agave.

37:38.131 --> 37:39.424
Yeah. I gotta drive.

37:39.507 --> 37:44.554
Dude, you do realize we have, like,
two solid hours of work ahead of us?

37:44.637 --> 37:47.599
All right. Yeah, I guess
I have to then.

37:50.643 --> 37:52.437
What is that? West Elm?

37:52.520 --> 37:55.190
Uh, close. It's a hand-me-down
from my brother.

38:00.779 --> 38:02.030
Cheers.

38:09.996 --> 38:12.624
So, what about you?
Do you have any siblings, or...

38:13.208 --> 38:15.585
Um... yeah, a brother.

38:16.252 --> 38:17.504
Be honest. Is he...

38:18.379 --> 38:19.798
The good looking one?

38:21.591 --> 38:23.051
He was, actually.

38:23.927 --> 38:25.845
What? And then he got fat?

38:31.476 --> 38:32.769
No, he died.

38:34.354 --> 38:36.147
Oh, my God, dude.

38:37.273 --> 38:38.983
Fuck, I am so sorry.

38:39.859 --> 38:41.486
I am just so insensitive.

38:41.569 --> 38:43.112
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're okay.

38:43.947 --> 38:48.159
If you ever needed someone
to talk to or anything...

40:11.159 --> 40:16.748
So, 30 feet from the load-bearing beam
is the first floor egress.

40:19.751 --> 40:21.753
Is this getting too cerebral for you?

40:22.503 --> 40:23.796
No, uh...

40:24.422 --> 40:27.091
- I think it's just a sinus issue.
- You want some nasal spray?

40:27.717 --> 40:30.428
Um, I'm gonna pass on the used
nasal spray. Thank you, though.

40:30.511 --> 40:32.764
Hey, hey, hey. It's organic.

40:33.097 --> 40:35.725
Clever upsell, but I think I'll live.

40:36.225 --> 40:37.810
I should get home anyway.

40:38.269 --> 40:39.646
All right, I'll walk you out.

40:57.580 --> 40:58.873
Wake up.

41:01.209 --> 41:03.711
Easy. It's just me.

41:04.963 --> 41:06.714
What are you doing sleeping on the couch?

41:11.010 --> 41:13.096
I don't... I don't know.

41:13.638 --> 41:14.639
Come on.

41:16.891 --> 41:17.892
What's wrong?

41:20.561 --> 41:22.271
Kevin, someone was in here.

41:23.272 --> 41:25.817
No, no, I know what you're gonna say.
It was another nightmare.

41:25.900 --> 41:28.820
But it was so vivid. Kevin, I felt it.

41:29.028 --> 41:31.489
Look, the door was locked.
You were passed out down there,

41:31.572 --> 41:33.491
- probably working...
- You're not listening!

41:33.616 --> 41:35.326
It was real, Kevin!

41:35.910 --> 41:37.245
You're calling me a liar.

41:37.328 --> 41:39.580
No. That's what you're choosing to hear.

41:39.664 --> 41:42.000
All right, let's just talk feelings.

41:42.083 --> 41:43.251
Pissed off.

41:43.960 --> 41:45.003
Kevin.

41:45.670 --> 41:46.963
Yeah, I can tell she is pissed.

41:47.046 --> 41:48.923
No. How are you feeling?

41:49.007 --> 41:51.884
Frustrated? I don't know.

41:52.010 --> 41:55.513
Look, my point is, is that we've both been
going through some difficult changes.

41:55.596 --> 41:57.223
We have this dinner with her mother

41:57.306 --> 41:59.308
that neither one of us are
looking forward to.

41:59.392 --> 42:02.687
Maybe all the stress is
an accumulation of these things.

42:02.770 --> 42:04.647
How does that explain what I saw?

42:07.567 --> 42:09.152
Paranoid hallucinations.

42:20.621 --> 42:21.622
No.

42:23.249 --> 42:25.084
We'll not gonna act like this
with each other.

42:25.168 --> 42:27.462
I never thought
you would take a side opposite me.

42:27.545 --> 42:28.421
I'm not!

42:29.172 --> 42:33.009
I'm just trying to think of
every rational explanation, Nat.

42:33.593 --> 42:35.344
I hate seeing you like this.

42:36.220 --> 42:39.557
If I could take this all away and
make it my own, you know I would.

42:55.198 --> 42:57.075
Let's go have a shitty meal with your mom.

42:57.909 --> 42:59.077
Okay.

43:19.013 --> 43:21.974
Jesus Christ, Odi!

43:22.058 --> 43:23.810
Gave me a freakin' heart attack.

43:58.636 --> 44:00.930
Yes, Nat, I fed your dog.

44:17.321 --> 44:18.406
Odi?

44:34.672 --> 44:35.798
Odi?

44:45.975 --> 44:47.059
Odi.

44:55.610 --> 44:56.652
Nat?

45:03.910 --> 45:04.994
Odi.

45:23.387 --> 45:24.430
Odi.

45:35.775 --> 45:38.611
Hey, little guy.

45:39.070 --> 45:40.446
You doing okay?

45:43.741 --> 45:47.286
Okay. I'll give you your space.

46:43.134 --> 46:45.011
Fuck this.

46:54.061 --> 46:55.062
Odi?

46:55.813 --> 46:57.106
Where'd you go?

47:34.518 --> 47:36.604
What the fuck?

49:38.267 --> 49:39.435
Dani?

49:44.440 --> 49:45.566
Dani.

49:46.483 --> 49:48.819
- I'll just check upstairs.
- Mmm-mmm.

49:53.073 --> 49:55.034
Un-fucking-believable.

49:56.285 --> 49:58.078
Let me guess. She's not upstairs.

49:58.162 --> 50:00.748
Well, maybe she went out to
get some last-minute stuff.

50:00.831 --> 50:02.333
She's not the most organized.

50:02.416 --> 50:05.252
I know, but I told her she needed
to be here to feed Odi.

50:05.336 --> 50:06.795
Okay, so we'll feed him now.

50:06.879 --> 50:09.715
Kevin, he's been home alone all day!

50:09.798 --> 50:11.592
Look, I'm sure he's down here somewhere.

50:11.675 --> 50:12.760
Odi?

50:12.843 --> 50:14.136
Odi, come on, bud!

50:14.678 --> 50:16.597
Odi.

50:18.224 --> 50:21.268
Hi, baby. You okay?

50:23.812 --> 50:25.564
You know, I knew she was going to do this.

50:25.648 --> 50:27.316
This is why I don't want to be involved.

50:27.399 --> 50:29.276
She tries to plan
these things with my mom,

50:29.360 --> 50:32.071
and then they get into it,
and I have to clean up the mess.

50:32.154 --> 50:34.782
And it's such bullshit! I just...
I just want her to show up

50:34.865 --> 50:36.283
when she says she's gonna show up.

50:36.367 --> 50:37.826
Don't worry about Dani.

50:37.910 --> 50:41.622
She'll show up. And if she doesn't,
just deal with her when she does.

50:42.248 --> 50:44.375
- Look, Odi is okay.
- Mmm-hmm.

50:44.458 --> 50:47.962
I'm gonna handle dinner.
I just want you to relax. Okay?

50:49.088 --> 50:53.676
Hmm! It is such a trip how America
westernizes these international cuisines.

50:53.968 --> 50:59.515
When I was in China, there was none of
this sweet and sour and General Tso crap.

50:59.598 --> 51:03.185
Yeah. Sorry to drop the takeout
on you, Farrah. Just short on time.

51:03.269 --> 51:05.312
No, no, no!
Thank you, Kevin. It's wonderful.

51:07.356 --> 51:09.024
Interesting. Mmm.

51:10.567 --> 51:15.281
So, I, uh, take it you're
still working on that documentary then?

51:16.407 --> 51:18.242
If you're talking about my life's work,

51:18.325 --> 51:20.369
yes, I'm still working
on that documentary.

51:20.953 --> 51:21.870
"Life's work?"

51:23.330 --> 51:24.498
How's that going, anyway?

51:24.581 --> 51:26.208
- Ah, it's going wonderfully.
- Hmm.

51:26.292 --> 51:27.960
- Joaquin and I...
- Who's Joaquin?

51:28.043 --> 51:29.086
He's my lover.

51:30.838 --> 51:33.257
Right. Is there any more
Szechuan chicken?

51:35.009 --> 51:36.093
Natalie...

51:36.552 --> 51:38.262
If there's something on your mind,

51:38.345 --> 51:40.848
I am opening the door for you
to share it with me.

51:42.099 --> 51:43.183
No, thanks.

51:43.642 --> 51:46.312
I'm allowed to enjoy my life, Natalie.

51:47.021 --> 51:48.522
You know, when I was your age,

51:48.605 --> 51:51.483
I was raising two daughters
and running a home business.

51:51.567 --> 51:54.278
And who funded that business, Mom?
Oh, right, it was dad.

51:54.361 --> 51:56.530
Drinks. Beer? Wine? I'll be right...

51:56.613 --> 51:58.490
Why is it so hard for you to support me?

51:58.574 --> 52:01.410
Well, it's hard to support something
that I've never seen!

52:02.286 --> 52:05.497
You know, I don't have to subject
myself to this kind of harassment.

52:05.748 --> 52:08.292
- Harassment?
- Yes! Harassment!

52:08.375 --> 52:10.544
You're a bully, Natalie.

52:10.627 --> 52:13.964
In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if that's
why your sister decided not to show up!

52:14.048 --> 52:15.632
Uh, I think we all know that's...

52:15.716 --> 52:18.510
No, no, no, no! No, Kevin.
It's fine. I'd like to leave now.

52:18.594 --> 52:20.763
Yeah! Kevin, she'd like to leave now.

52:20.846 --> 52:22.348
Tell Joaquin I said hi.

52:22.431 --> 52:24.266
You know what, sweetheart?

52:24.350 --> 52:27.353
This brooding teen act
is a little outdated.

52:27.436 --> 52:30.731
Well, so is the whole
free-spirited charade.

52:30.814 --> 52:34.526
You should probably think about taking
"I raised two daughters" off your resume,

52:34.610 --> 52:36.487
because you quit that job a long time ago.

52:36.570 --> 52:39.490
That is so unfair! I sacrificed
everything for you and Dani!

52:39.573 --> 52:44.286
Oh, nothing but "I, I, I, I!"
You are such a fucking narcissist!

52:44.370 --> 52:45.996
- I am not!
- You only care about things

52:46.080 --> 52:49.041
that affect you! Honestly, Dani is
probably at her house right now,

52:49.124 --> 52:51.960
relapsing. Shooting up just like she did
the last time you came!

52:52.044 --> 52:53.045
Why would you say that?

52:53.128 --> 52:56.090
All because you rip through our lives
like a goddamn cancerous tornado!

53:02.930 --> 53:04.723
Come on! We gotta go! We gotta go!

53:04.807 --> 53:06.433
You're not welcome here!

53:07.351 --> 53:08.602
What the fuck!

53:15.734 --> 53:18.695
Jon Santos, 19.
Katrina Kanter, 16.

53:18.779 --> 53:22.032
Trey Mahana, 17.
Any or all of 'em look familiar to you?

53:23.283 --> 53:26.036
No. I've never seen
any of these people in my life.

53:28.914 --> 53:30.124
"Unite the White?"

53:30.999 --> 53:32.209
I don't get it. What is that?

53:32.292 --> 53:35.546
One of the kids copied and pasted
this poster onto their Facebook page.

53:36.880 --> 53:40.509
The original source
had your address listed on it.

53:40.926 --> 53:43.345
It calls to recruit
white supremacist members.

53:46.557 --> 53:47.933
You think we did?

53:48.016 --> 53:49.435
I don't know what to think yet.

53:49.518 --> 53:52.521
But I do know it's a crazy time,
and anything goes.

53:52.604 --> 53:55.899
How dumb would you have to be
to put your home address on it?

53:55.983 --> 53:58.569
As dumb as you'd have to be
to post it in the first place.

54:00.946 --> 54:04.450
Okay. Officer Richardson,
I think what Kevin is trying to say is...

54:05.033 --> 54:07.161
That we would never contribute
to something like this...

54:09.163 --> 54:10.164
Ever.

54:16.670 --> 54:17.838
All right.

54:19.339 --> 54:22.968
If that's the case, you should start
thinking about someone you know who would.

54:23.469 --> 54:25.053
We just moved in a couple months ago.

54:25.137 --> 54:27.264
We haven't had time to
meet the people around us.

54:27.639 --> 54:29.558
But what about enemies outside the area?

54:29.641 --> 54:31.268
Anyone who may harbor ill will?

54:31.810 --> 54:33.770
A scorned lover? A vendetta of some kind?

54:34.688 --> 54:38.775
No. No. I mean, I'm at work,
school, or home.

54:38.859 --> 54:41.570
I don't have time for interactions
outside of that right now.

54:41.904 --> 54:42.988
Mrs. Dadich?

54:44.156 --> 54:46.283
Mmm-mmm. No one.

54:46.366 --> 54:49.453
Isn't there a way to
trace back who posted this?

54:49.536 --> 54:52.664
Sure. Absolutely.
If, uh, the original hadn't been deleted.

54:52.748 --> 54:55.751
So that's it? I mean, what do we do?

54:56.001 --> 54:58.420
They think we're running some
sort of goddamn Nazi operation?

54:58.504 --> 55:01.507
- Okay, Kevin...
- They burned the car! Natalie.

55:04.259 --> 55:07.971
Listen, Mr. Dadich,
we are following the trail that we have.

55:08.180 --> 55:10.807
But if there's other information
you have to offer us.

55:10.891 --> 55:13.852
Anything out of the ordinary,
disturbances of some kind?

55:13.936 --> 55:15.395
That would be very helpful.

55:16.813 --> 55:19.358
No, nothing that immediately
comes to mind.

55:21.401 --> 55:22.611
No.

55:23.028 --> 55:24.029
Right.

55:25.447 --> 55:27.699
Well, if something does.

55:34.873 --> 55:38.293
Claudia. Hi. It's Natalie Dadich.

55:38.585 --> 55:41.421
I was just in the neighborhood, and...

55:42.631 --> 55:44.341
These are for you.

55:44.424 --> 55:46.134
Oh! How nice.

55:48.053 --> 55:50.180
All right. Got the ball. Good boy.
Go get it!

55:50.264 --> 55:52.015
Go on! Go get it, Odi!

55:53.308 --> 55:55.143
The ball! Get... get the ball.

55:55.227 --> 55:56.645
Fancy meeting you here.

55:56.728 --> 55:58.105
Hey.

55:58.522 --> 55:59.606
- Here.
- No.

55:59.856 --> 56:02.359
You look tired
and dehydrated. Take it, please?

56:02.693 --> 56:05.028
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

56:05.195 --> 56:08.699
Mmm. And thanks for meeting me here today.

56:09.533 --> 56:13.829
Between Natalie's family drama,
house, school,

56:13.912 --> 56:16.290
I just needed a normal conversation.

56:16.373 --> 56:17.791
- Happy I can help.
- Mmm.

56:19.459 --> 56:21.295
Your dog sucks at fetch.

56:21.378 --> 56:23.046
Yeah, he does. Horrible.

56:24.506 --> 56:26.091
Here you go.

56:26.758 --> 56:29.553
Obviously what happened
the other night at the house

56:29.636 --> 56:34.391
was just people toying with us,
but there's still just some things that...

56:35.100 --> 56:38.228
I don't know,
they're just... different.

56:39.438 --> 56:42.274
- You wanna know what happened.
- Yeah.

56:44.151 --> 56:47.821
The truth is, I don't know.
Nobody does.

56:48.238 --> 56:51.241
Sure, we know the logistics,
but we don't know why.

56:52.284 --> 56:53.952
Jay could be an asshole.

56:55.621 --> 56:58.582
He was my older brother, and I love him.

57:00.042 --> 57:01.543
I loved him.

57:03.420 --> 57:05.255
When they were living out of state,

57:05.339 --> 57:08.467
Jay wasn't as faithful to to Erin
as he once promised.

57:08.592 --> 57:11.720
As you can imagine,
it didn't go over too well with Erin.

57:12.512 --> 57:14.264
So, she decided to get even.

57:15.515 --> 57:17.267
She had an affair, too?

57:18.226 --> 57:20.771
Some mystery man no one ever heard about.

57:21.438 --> 57:23.899
She never said his name, or who it was.

57:23.982 --> 57:26.944
- So Jay knew about it?
- Eventually.

57:27.694 --> 57:31.782
Thing is, all those women that Jay messed
around with, they were more like trophies,

57:31.865 --> 57:33.784
you know. But Erin...

57:34.451 --> 57:37.496
Erin, she had real feelings. Bang him...

57:37.579 --> 57:41.541
Well, she said it was a one-time thing,
but that bitch was up to something.

57:44.127 --> 57:48.799
Erin designed the house from the ground
up, but Jay paid for everything.

57:48.882 --> 57:51.885
Every single cent, no questions asked.

57:53.845 --> 57:56.765
My brother loved that woman to a fault.

57:58.266 --> 58:00.394
They were getting along better, too.

58:00.477 --> 58:05.607
I don't understand. If they were doing
so much better, then why...

58:08.860 --> 58:10.487
What is your location?

58:10.570 --> 58:12.447
I'm in my house...

58:16.201 --> 58:17.744
Between you and I...

58:18.996 --> 58:20.455
My brother didn't do it.

58:21.039 --> 58:24.918
Sure, he had a temper,
but he wasn't a murderer.

58:25.002 --> 58:27.337
And he certainly wouldn't commit suicide.

58:28.255 --> 58:31.675
And what, all of a sudden,
the cameras are all fucked up?

58:33.468 --> 58:37.597
There was a lot of
little details that just didn't add up.

58:38.640 --> 58:41.518
The cops didn't care about any of that.

58:42.644 --> 58:44.896
It's not like it was a white man's murder.

58:48.316 --> 58:50.152
I didn't know we had company.

58:54.114 --> 58:55.574
Oh. Oh, man.

58:55.657 --> 58:57.993
Please tell me you twisted your ankle
playing with my dog

58:58.076 --> 58:59.745
so I can make fun of you forever.

58:59.828 --> 59:01.955
I think it was a bee.
I think a bee got me.

59:02.039 --> 59:04.875
- A bee got you? A bee?
- Yes. Is it bad? Does it look bad?

59:05.250 --> 59:07.377
- Ah, there it is. Hold on. Hold on.
- Ow!

59:07.461 --> 59:09.880
Got it. Right there.

59:09.963 --> 59:11.173
Oh, it's a big one.

59:11.256 --> 59:13.383
Are you okay, or are we gonna
have to amputate?

59:13.467 --> 59:15.343
Think I'll get a second opinion.

59:21.266 --> 59:23.101
Hey, maybe you should check on Odi.

59:28.023 --> 59:28.982
Odi.

59:29.274 --> 59:30.901
Odi, come here, bud.

59:32.235 --> 59:33.195
Odi.

59:35.614 --> 59:39.159
- I've never seen him like this.
- I'll get some water.

59:40.035 --> 59:42.913
Natalie. Natalie.

59:43.663 --> 59:46.374
Uh, I'm... I'm so sorry for the intrusion.

59:46.458 --> 59:50.420
No. No, I... I'm sorry for
making you uncomfortable.

59:50.837 --> 59:53.632
Claudia just springs things on me
sometimes. I just...

59:53.715 --> 59:55.092
She runs her mouth a lot.

59:55.383 --> 59:57.677
Normal husband, wife stuff.
You know how it is.

59:57.886 --> 01:00:00.055
So you're having some...
some problems with the house?

01:00:01.765 --> 01:00:04.142
I may have heard a little more
than I was supposed to.

01:00:04.684 --> 01:00:06.770
I... I'm sure it's fine.

01:00:07.145 --> 01:00:09.815
You know, I think,
given the shock of everything...

01:00:10.565 --> 01:00:13.568
Claudia may have acted
a little impulsively.

01:00:14.653 --> 01:00:16.238
If you're having trouble with it,

01:00:16.655 --> 01:00:20.575
I'd be willing to negotiate with you.
Buy the house back.

01:00:22.119 --> 01:00:23.578
Not much less than you paid.

01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:26.248
Less?

01:00:27.082 --> 01:00:30.544
Yeah, given the issues,
I'm sure that depreciates the value.

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:34.840
Well, thank you for the offer, but, um...

01:00:35.382 --> 01:00:38.093
I just don't think we can
take the hit right now.

01:00:38.927 --> 01:00:40.595
Sorry for the intrusion.

01:00:42.931 --> 01:00:47.227
You and your husband took advantage
of a woman not in her right mind.

01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:50.772
All he left her was that house.

01:00:52.065 --> 01:00:56.570
And you two swiped it out from under her
like a free meal.

01:01:06.538 --> 01:01:07.747
Think about what I said.

01:01:13.879 --> 01:01:15.005
Kevin.

01:01:16.047 --> 01:01:18.383
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, slow down.
What's wrong?

01:01:24.639 --> 01:01:28.310
Hi. I'm Avery, Kevin's class partner.

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.353
I mentioned that a couple weeks ago.

01:01:31.605 --> 01:01:33.940
Right. I must've forgotten.

01:01:34.024 --> 01:01:35.817
Well, I'm gonna...

01:01:37.944 --> 01:01:39.654
Bye, buddy. Feel better.

01:01:41.615 --> 01:01:42.824
Nice to meet you.

01:01:43.158 --> 01:01:44.826
- See you in class.
- Yeah. Thanks.

01:01:48.872 --> 01:01:49.873
What?

01:01:50.832 --> 01:01:52.959
All right, let's get to it.

01:01:53.585 --> 01:01:56.713
We ran Odi's blood work.
I'm gonna be honest here.

01:01:56.796 --> 01:02:00.342
Between that and his physical,
it doesn't look good.

01:02:02.052 --> 01:02:03.845
How not good is it?

01:02:03.929 --> 01:02:08.183
His blood contains elements of a powerful
toxin causing his health to deteriorate.

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:11.728
It's usually due to something
the dog accidentally ingested.

01:02:11.811 --> 01:02:14.981
But the root of it is that
his heart is giving out on him.

01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:17.901
Well, is this something that we can treat?

01:02:18.193 --> 01:02:20.904
It'll really just be prolonging the pain.

01:02:22.113 --> 01:02:25.992
Take the time you need. Talk about it.

01:02:56.898 --> 01:02:59.317
How could you not tell me
something like that?

01:03:01.403 --> 01:03:03.613
I just...

01:03:04.906 --> 01:03:07.284
I didn't want it to cause any issues.

01:03:08.827 --> 01:03:12.038
Well, I'm going to call you out on
your bad judgment there, Nat.

01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:16.376
This deal could change everything.

01:03:16.459 --> 01:03:20.380
I wasn't in a position to turn it down.
I had already signed the paperwork,

01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:23.383
but I swear, I had no idea.

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.429
Have you been meeting him?

01:03:33.268 --> 01:03:34.269
It's just work.

01:03:34.352 --> 01:03:37.939
Whole goddamn city full of people,
and you have to work with him?

01:03:38.023 --> 01:03:40.108
Exactly, okay. Have to.

01:03:40.191 --> 01:03:42.986
- Look, I don't have a choice.
- Bullshit.

01:03:47.032 --> 01:03:48.700
You chose your work...

01:03:50.035 --> 01:03:52.120
Over my feelings, over our marriage.

01:03:52.203 --> 01:03:56.124
- No, that's not true. It is not like that.
- He's trying to get in your pants.

01:04:02.422 --> 01:04:03.923
Isn't that what you said last time?

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:06.259
Yeah.

01:04:08.762 --> 01:04:10.722
I remember that pretty fucking clearly.

01:04:22.776 --> 01:04:24.527
God damn it, Odi.

01:04:34.329 --> 01:04:35.372
Kevin.

01:04:36.414 --> 01:04:37.916
- Kevin.
- What?

01:04:40.502 --> 01:04:41.878
Someone's at the door.

01:04:44.464 --> 01:04:46.466
- I don't hear anything.
- Kevin, I swear to God.

01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:47.592
Okay, calm down.

01:04:55.308 --> 01:04:56.267
Don't move.

01:04:56.351 --> 01:04:59.729
- What the fuck do we do?
- Get your phone ready to call the cops.

01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:04.442
My phone's not here.
Kevin, my fucking phone's not here.

01:05:04.526 --> 01:05:05.652
Okay. Stay calm.

01:05:08.321 --> 01:05:10.782
Kevin. Kevin, don't fucking
leave me up here.

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:40.186
So, after you entered the kitchen,
you didn't hear any other noises?

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:42.147
No open doors, nothing?

01:05:43.189 --> 01:05:44.983
And no physical description?

01:05:47.152 --> 01:05:49.237
There wasn't anyone there to describe.

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.781
Hey, I'm just trying to jog your memory.

01:05:57.912 --> 01:06:00.457
Okay, we'll write up a report.

01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:05.462
If anything else comes to mind,
feel free to reach out to me directly.

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:08.047
- There is one other thing.
- Nat.

01:06:08.131 --> 01:06:11.426
If you could not make me feel
like a lunatic, that would be great.

01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:16.055
- I've been having these...
- Nightmares.

01:06:20.226 --> 01:06:25.899
- There is this man. He's rail thin, pale.
- In the home?

01:06:25.982 --> 01:06:28.860
Yes. I swear to you, I saw him.

01:06:28.943 --> 01:06:31.779
He crawled out into my hallway
and then he attacked me.

01:06:35.909 --> 01:06:41.206
Right, so you... you had a pale man crawl
into your hallway and attack you?

01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:44.292
And you didn't think to report it?

01:06:45.168 --> 01:06:49.214
No. Because, like Kevin mentioned, at the
time, I thought it was just nightmares.

01:06:49.297 --> 01:06:54.010
But then things, they started disappearing
and reappearing in other places.

01:06:54.093 --> 01:06:56.804
There was this tennis ball
that he put on my bed.

01:06:56.888 --> 01:06:59.265
Okay, so he put a tennis ball...

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:01.893
On your bed?

01:07:01.976 --> 01:07:06.147
No, the tennis ball, it was underneath
my bed and I could not reach it.

01:07:06.231 --> 01:07:10.401
So I went to grab something, and when I
came back, he had put it back on my bed.

01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:15.698
Okay. Okay.

01:07:16.449 --> 01:07:19.160
Tall, pale man, tennis ball, hallway.

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:21.871
Got it.

01:07:26.417 --> 01:07:27.585
We'll be in touch.

01:07:30.547 --> 01:07:33.633
- Oh, we found your phone in the kitchen.
- Thank you.

01:07:40.098 --> 01:07:42.809
I hope you know how insane
that made us just seem.

01:07:44.602 --> 01:07:47.855
Okay, you know what, Kevin,
your wife is sitting with the cops,

01:07:47.939 --> 01:07:51.192
telling them that she doesn't feel safe,
that I am terrified,

01:07:51.276 --> 01:07:52.652
and that's your response?

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:56.281
Someone just vandalized our house, Kevin.
You don't think it's within the realm

01:07:56.364 --> 01:07:59.033
of possibility that someone
could be breaking into our house?

01:07:59.117 --> 01:08:01.244
Not to move tennis balls
and house keys around. No.

01:08:01.369 --> 01:08:03.037
Well, you know what,
let me remind you

01:08:03.121 --> 01:08:06.082
that I am not the only one who heard
whatever was in our house tonight,

01:08:06.165 --> 01:08:08.001
- okay, so...
- What do you want me to do, Nat?

01:08:08.084 --> 01:08:11.796
I don't know, Kevin. We have a house full
of cameras. Maybe that's a good place...

01:08:11.879 --> 01:08:13.881
Do you have any idea
how expensive that would be?

01:08:13.965 --> 01:08:17.635
My guess would be less than our funerals
whenever someone murders us in our sleep.

01:08:17.719 --> 01:08:19.511
Okay, pump the brakes on the melodrama.

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:21.805
What we need to be buying is a new car.

01:08:22.015 --> 01:08:24.642
To replace the rental that
we're spending a fortune on.

01:08:25.059 --> 01:08:26.894
We can't afford this right now.

01:08:30.898 --> 01:08:33.734
So, uh, once you're logged in,
you'll be able to control the locks

01:08:33.818 --> 01:08:35.403
from any room in the house.

01:08:35.486 --> 01:08:40.617
So, red means locked. Green. Easy as that.

01:08:41.158 --> 01:08:43.077
Right now everything's running smoothly.

01:08:43.161 --> 01:08:45.537
If you start experiencing
some glitching, give us a call.

01:08:45.622 --> 01:08:49.334
If it's a consistent problem,
we might have to replace the whole system.

01:08:49.751 --> 01:08:50.835
Excellent.

01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:08.144
I asked for a completed sample rack

01:09:08.603 --> 01:09:12.439
with 15 additional samples
by the time I got back.

01:09:12.814 --> 01:09:14.524
- I know.
- And what?

01:09:15.693 --> 01:09:19.529
It's two weeks later
and I have half that.

01:09:19.613 --> 01:09:20.740
I know.

01:09:21.198 --> 01:09:25.118
As a person, I am empathetic to
the shitstorm that is your life right now.

01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:30.207
But as your boss, I warned you
what you would be getting into.

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:33.461
I don't know what to say.

01:09:34.337 --> 01:09:37.423
If you had any idea
how embarrassed I am...

01:09:41.551 --> 01:09:44.430
I'll give you the extension. One week.

01:09:44.639 --> 01:09:46.349
- Understood?
- Yes.

01:09:46.432 --> 01:09:50.603
I need to see the woman who was here
in this office when we first met.

01:09:50.812 --> 01:09:52.854
That woman had her life together.

01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:02.365
I don't know what to tell you, man.
Sounds like you bought a lemon.

01:10:02.448 --> 01:10:04.742
You guys saw that house. It's perfect.

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:08.371
- The price we got it for...
- Was apparently way too much.

01:10:08.454 --> 01:10:11.708
Whatever. Let's just get this cleaned up
before the sun goes down.

01:10:11.791 --> 01:10:14.001
You know, a similar thing
happened to me once.

01:10:14.085 --> 01:10:17.714
Met this super cute girl.
Eyes, smile, even had a good personality.

01:10:17.797 --> 01:10:22.927
So I sleep with her. I wake up
in the morning with chlamydia.

01:10:23.344 --> 01:10:25.054
False advertising all around, man.

01:10:25.138 --> 01:10:26.347
- What do you mean?
- What?

01:10:26.431 --> 01:10:28.099
You don't wake up with chlamydia.

01:10:28.182 --> 01:10:29.267
That's not the point.

01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:32.937
No, it is. If you're going to tell
a story like that, facts actually matter.

01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:35.273
How do you even know that
she gave you the chlamydia?

01:10:35.481 --> 01:10:36.441
Dude.

01:10:37.316 --> 01:10:38.860
- Hey.
- Oh.

01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:42.488
You're not getting squeamish
on us, are you?

01:10:42.572 --> 01:10:45.491
Maybe you're not cut out
for this line of work, Princess.

01:10:45.575 --> 01:10:47.076
- You did this.
- I did it?

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:49.036
Yeah. This is why you can't tell stories.

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:51.581
- Do you need me any help? Okay.
- No.

01:10:51.664 --> 01:10:53.166
Oh, God.

01:10:53.458 --> 01:10:57.420
I'm working as fast as I can, Nick,
but my mother showed up unexpectedly.

01:10:57.503 --> 01:10:59.464
I just had to put my dog down.

01:10:59.547 --> 01:11:00.840
I know. Um...

01:11:01.674 --> 01:11:07.096
Look, Anne's breathing down my neck. So,
is there anything I can help you with?

01:11:07.722 --> 01:11:10.516
No, no, no. I'm fine. I have it, okay?

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.435
Did I do something to upset you?

01:11:12.518 --> 01:11:15.146
I didn't want to bring this up,
especially not right now,

01:11:15.271 --> 01:11:16.773
but since we're on the subject of it,

01:11:16.856 --> 01:11:19.442
you cannot be sending flowers
to my house, Nick.

01:11:19.734 --> 01:11:23.446
Okay. Um...
was I supposed to send flowers?

01:11:24.363 --> 01:11:27.241
No, the flowers that you sent.
Me and Kevin got in a huge fight...

01:11:27.325 --> 01:11:30.870
Natalie, wait. I...
I didn't send you any flowers.

01:11:30.953 --> 01:11:34.665
- Nick, I saw the card. You signed it.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

01:11:34.749 --> 01:11:37.460
I'm sorry, you said stay away.
And so I did.

01:11:59.357 --> 01:12:00.358
What the hell?

01:13:01.002 --> 01:13:03.004
911. What's your emergency?

01:13:03.087 --> 01:13:07.592
I think that someone is trying to break
into my house. It's 992, Hallow Park Way.

01:13:07.717 --> 01:13:10.678
- What's your first and last name?
- Natalie Dadich.

01:13:12.096 --> 01:13:14.098
Please, I need somebody here right now!

01:13:14.181 --> 01:13:15.975
- Please!
- We have officers dispatched.

01:13:16.058 --> 01:13:18.519
I need you to remain calm.
Keep talking on the phone.

01:13:18.603 --> 01:13:19.729
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:13:20.062 --> 01:13:22.189
How many intruders are there?

01:13:22.273 --> 01:13:23.691
- I... I don't know.
- Are they armed?

01:13:23.774 --> 01:13:24.775
I don't know.

01:13:24.859 --> 01:13:27.403
Ma'am, are you able to get
to a secure location?

01:13:29.989 --> 01:13:31.157
Are they close?

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:34.160
They're on the way, but
I need you to answer my questions.

01:13:41.125 --> 01:13:42.418
Ma'am, can you hear me?

01:13:43.461 --> 01:13:47.548
Yes. Uh, I'm sorry I...
I made a mistake.

01:13:47.632 --> 01:13:49.300
So you don't need an officer?

01:13:49.967 --> 01:13:52.845
No, I just... I... I'm so sorry.

01:13:52.929 --> 01:13:56.349
We just had a scare earlier this week,
and I'm really on edge.

01:13:57.850 --> 01:14:00.144
- You be safe, okay?
- Yeah.

01:14:20.873 --> 01:14:22.333
Help.

01:14:40.935 --> 01:14:42.353
911. What's your emergency?

01:14:42.436 --> 01:14:44.271
I... I need someone here right now!

01:14:44.355 --> 01:14:47.441
It's 992 Hallow Park Way.
There's someone in the house.

01:14:47.525 --> 01:14:50.653
We got a call for this number and location
stating no assistance was needed.

01:14:50.736 --> 01:14:53.572
I changed my fucking mind!
I need someone here now!

01:14:58.452 --> 01:15:00.788
- How many intruders are there?
- I don't know how many.

01:15:00.871 --> 01:15:03.874
I don't know if they're armed. All I know
is that they're in my house.

01:15:03.958 --> 01:15:06.127
Are you able to get to a secure location?

01:15:28.733 --> 01:15:29.900
Hey, Nat?

01:15:46.584 --> 01:15:47.626
Nat.

01:16:26.707 --> 01:16:29.168
How's she doing?

01:16:29.251 --> 01:16:32.505
She's doing okay. Pretty bruised up.
May have a slight fracture.

01:16:36.675 --> 01:16:38.219
Did you find him?

01:16:38.844 --> 01:16:40.054
Not yet.

01:16:52.066 --> 01:16:53.901
We're not sleeping here tonight.

01:16:54.652 --> 01:16:56.529
The police checked the whole house.

01:16:56.612 --> 01:16:59.532
I don't care if they sit in their cars
and wait around all night.

01:16:59.615 --> 01:17:01.909
I'm not sleeping after what happened.

01:17:07.414 --> 01:17:08.707
You don't believe me.

01:17:08.833 --> 01:17:10.251
I believe you saw something.

01:17:10.334 --> 01:17:13.963
No. You don't believe that someone
was actually in the house.

01:17:14.046 --> 01:17:18.175
What about my phone, Kevin? How do you
explain all the pictures on it, huh?

01:17:19.093 --> 01:17:20.886
Maybe your friend, Nick, took 'em.

01:17:23.097 --> 01:17:26.767
- Wow, really?
- I said, "Maybe."

01:17:30.646 --> 01:17:35.317
Look, you said yourself the timestamps
were all from when you were home alone.

01:17:35.401 --> 01:17:37.903
- I'm sleeping in a hotel tonight.
- With what money?

01:17:37.987 --> 01:17:41.448
Our credit cards are maxed out.
The mortgage payment's due next week.

01:17:41.574 --> 01:17:43.450
Natalie, would you just stop?

01:17:46.996 --> 01:17:48.747
If you're seeing him, just tell me.

01:17:57.298 --> 01:18:01.135
Mr. Dadich, good to see you again.
Thanks for coming down on short notice.

01:18:01.218 --> 01:18:05.097
- I'm just looking for some answers.
- Uh, well, I am right there with you.

01:18:06.515 --> 01:18:09.435
So we went through your security footage.
Before we take a look,

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:12.688
I just want to go over your wife's
official statement, if that's okay.

01:18:12.771 --> 01:18:15.316
According to police records,
your wife spots the intruder.

01:18:15.399 --> 01:18:17.443
She runs upstairs, locks the door,

01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:21.405
then, somehow, the intruder
ends up in the room with her.

01:18:21.488 --> 01:18:24.575
She goes to run again,
blocked in by a bookcase,

01:18:24.658 --> 01:18:29.538
a bookcase, our team concluded, was in
a position inconsistent with her story.

01:18:30.789 --> 01:18:34.210
Mr. Dadich, to the best
of your recollection,

01:18:34.293 --> 01:18:37.922
is this account consistent with
what you believe to be true?

01:18:39.298 --> 01:18:41.383
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:18:49.433 --> 01:18:52.895
At no point does the footage
ever capture another person,

01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:58.651
not in the living room,
not in the foyer, not on the staircase.

01:19:02.196 --> 01:19:06.075
Mr. Dadich, no one ever enters
or exits the premises

01:19:06.617 --> 01:19:09.078
until your wife
throws herself out of the window.

01:19:12.706 --> 01:19:15.960
- I'm not making this up.
- I never said that.

01:19:16.043 --> 01:19:17.920
It's called fucking subtext, Kevin.

01:19:18.003 --> 01:19:20.631
Why else would you ask me
to go back on my medication?

01:19:20.756 --> 01:19:22.841
All right, let's just take a moment.

01:19:24.176 --> 01:19:29.556
Natalie, I'd like to be clear
that no one in this room

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:32.393
is suggesting
that you're fabricating anything.

01:19:32.476 --> 01:19:38.232
Believe me, okay? I know how this sounds,
but I know what I saw. I'm not delusional.

01:19:38.315 --> 01:19:42.027
- We never should've moved into that house.
- But we did. So...

01:19:42.111 --> 01:19:43.362
So we sell it.

01:19:43.445 --> 01:19:46.198
After all the attention
you've drawn to it?

01:19:46.323 --> 01:19:48.867
We. I meant, "we've drawn to it."

01:19:48.951 --> 01:19:52.204
Yes, we can sell it back
to Claudia and her husband, okay?

01:19:52.288 --> 01:19:53.664
I spoke with Robert, and he...

01:19:53.747 --> 01:19:56.417
Wait, you spoke to Robert? When?

01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:59.295
When when I went to go ask Claudia
for some history on the house.

01:19:59.378 --> 01:20:01.088
- Oh, my God.
- Look, it was a valid concern.

01:20:01.171 --> 01:20:02.506
Why would you bother them

01:20:02.589 --> 01:20:04.842
about being haunted
by who the fuck knows what

01:20:04.925 --> 01:20:06.802
in a place where
their family was murdered?

01:20:06.885 --> 01:20:09.263
I don't know, Kevin.
Why are you so concerned

01:20:09.346 --> 01:20:12.141
with everyone else's feelings but mine?

01:20:19.898 --> 01:20:23.569
I don't understand how I'm the bad guy
when all I'm doing is looking out for us.

01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:25.654
You don't have any boundaries.
That's your problem.

01:20:25.779 --> 01:20:28.032
You do whatever you want.
You don't care how people feel.

01:20:28.115 --> 01:20:31.160
Oh, well, what about how I feel, Kevin?

01:20:32.036 --> 01:20:35.456
You have never sounded
more like your mother, you know that?

01:20:35.539 --> 01:20:40.044
You're such a fucking asshole. Why
would you even say something like that?

01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:44.465
Oh, yeah, that's great. Just go ahead
and walk away like you always do

01:20:44.548 --> 01:20:47.843
because you're a fucking coward.

01:20:47.926 --> 01:20:51.138
Kevin, what are you doing?

01:20:51.263 --> 01:20:52.473
Kevin!

01:20:52.556 --> 01:20:56.226
Oh, my God. Someone help!
Someone call 911!

01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:59.563
Baby, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
It's okay.

01:20:59.646 --> 01:21:01.523
Someone call 911!

01:21:05.069 --> 01:21:06.737
Mrs. Dadich.

01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:08.739
He is coherent,
and there are no indications

01:21:08.822 --> 01:21:11.533
of any memory loss
or other physical trauma.

01:21:11.658 --> 01:21:16.330
- Okay. So, what happened?
- Uh, why don't you have a seat? Please.

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:24.421
Are you aware of something called Nerium?

01:21:25.881 --> 01:21:29.385
- No.
- It's a lethal poisoning agent.

01:21:29.468 --> 01:21:32.096
And the reason I ask
is because we found traces of it

01:21:32.179 --> 01:21:33.680
in your husband's bloodstream.

01:21:33.764 --> 01:21:37.309
Now, taken in small doses
over a prolonged period of time,

01:21:37.393 --> 01:21:42.147
it can lead to health deteriorations,
ranging from vomiting or muscle weakness

01:21:42.231 --> 01:21:48.153
to seizures or arrhythmic heart function,
sometimes mistaken as cardiac arrest.

01:21:49.196 --> 01:21:51.490
You have any idea
how that got into his blood?

01:21:55.452 --> 01:21:56.703
I wanna see Kevin.

01:21:56.787 --> 01:21:58.622
- I can't let that...
- It's my husband.

01:21:58.705 --> 01:22:01.750
- What do you mean you can't allow me to...
- I understand that, Mrs. Dadich.

01:22:01.834 --> 01:22:05.504
But he's with the authorities right now.
So, why don't you just have a seat?

01:22:06.839 --> 01:22:09.425
No, I am
on your side, Natalie.

01:22:09.508 --> 01:22:11.176
Well, it doesn't feel like it.

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:13.011
But I'm just trying to understand.

01:22:13.095 --> 01:22:15.055
According to
Mr. Dadich's hospital records,

01:22:15.139 --> 01:22:17.724
he's been exposed to this substance
for quite some time now.

01:22:17.808 --> 01:22:19.935
What? Why would I try
and kill my husband

01:22:20.018 --> 01:22:22.771
after working so hard
to rebuild our marriage?

01:22:22.855 --> 01:22:25.232
Oh, maybe because this Nick Scott guy
comes back into town.

01:22:25.315 --> 01:22:26.150
Oh, my God.

01:22:26.233 --> 01:22:28.110
You decide you wanna have a life with him.

01:22:28.193 --> 01:22:31.155
Young, stable, handsome.
Also, he's kick-starting your career.

01:22:31.238 --> 01:22:33.949
- I love my husband.
- Maybe a chemical imbalance in the brain.

01:22:34.032 --> 01:22:35.909
There's footage of you running around
the house

01:22:36.034 --> 01:22:38.704
- from an invisible intruder.
- There was someone in my house!

01:22:38.787 --> 01:22:40.956
Maybe because you just realized...

01:22:41.039 --> 01:22:43.876
Your husband is
never going to forgive you.

01:22:51.258 --> 01:22:52.968
Oh, is this you
ending our conversation?

01:22:53.051 --> 01:22:56.430
Well, if I'm not under arrest,
I'd like to get back to work now.

01:22:57.890 --> 01:22:59.099
By all means.

01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:24.291
- How're you feeling?
- Better than yesterday, I guess.

01:23:26.752 --> 01:23:28.754
Uh, hey, I was gonna
make us dinner tonight.

01:23:29.963 --> 01:23:32.257
Is there anything you want to request?

01:23:32.341 --> 01:23:34.801
You know, I've got to work
on the project again.

01:23:34.885 --> 01:23:37.846
- With Avery?
- Yeah.

01:23:38.764 --> 01:23:41.266
Are you sure that you should be
pushing yourself like that?

01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:42.976
You just got out of the hospital.

01:23:43.101 --> 01:23:46.146
It's half our grade.
I don't really know that we have a choice.

01:23:49.858 --> 01:23:53.612
Plus, we're running behind. I don't wanna
make her lift all the dead weight.

01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:58.742
You don't wanna take your lunch?

01:23:59.159 --> 01:24:01.745
No, I'm not feeling up to a whole meal.

01:24:03.038 --> 01:24:04.331
Start light.

01:24:06.124 --> 01:24:08.085
- Bye, Nat.
- Bye.

01:24:22.307 --> 01:24:24.476
Hi. Can I help you?

01:24:25.018 --> 01:24:31.191
Sor... Sorry, uh...
You're just such a beautiful woman.

01:24:32.109 --> 01:24:33.735
I think you have the wrong house.

01:24:34.861 --> 01:24:40.659
Oh... you really just like to
get right into things, huh?

01:24:41.785 --> 01:24:43.704
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

01:24:43.787 --> 01:24:46.248
Hey, what are you doing?

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.836
Chica, you really do
like to put up a fight.

01:24:50.919 --> 01:24:53.672
Come here.

01:24:53.755 --> 01:24:55.716
Come here. Hey, hey!

01:24:55.799 --> 01:24:57.884
I was just kinda hoping
you'd be wearing a dress,

01:24:57.968 --> 01:25:00.929
make this a little easier
on me, huh?

01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:05.767
Jesus Christ, lady!
What the f...

01:25:09.146 --> 01:25:11.982
Don't fight. It's a mistake...

01:25:30.959 --> 01:25:34.838
Got some good news for you.
We were able to ID your attacker.

01:25:34.921 --> 01:25:36.715
Travis Murray.

01:25:36.798 --> 01:25:40.469
Your camera caught him canvassing
the house just before the attack.

01:25:40.552 --> 01:25:43.096
We have reason to believe
he's been watching your house

01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:45.432
- for quite some time now.
- So what do we do now?

01:25:45.515 --> 01:25:47.643
We get a lawyer, press charges?

01:25:47.726 --> 01:25:50.395
Uh, well, not exactly.

01:25:50.479 --> 01:25:53.065
We aren't actually able
to place him under arrest.

01:25:53.148 --> 01:25:55.317
- What?
- There is an investigation

01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:58.362
that has dug up some information
relieving Travis of all charges.

01:25:58.445 --> 01:26:00.447
What do you mean? He broke into our house.

01:26:00.530 --> 01:26:03.825
Robert Sorrentino, the man who sold you
the house in which you currently reside.

01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:07.287
- What does he have to do with anything?
- Sorrentino has been taken into custody

01:26:07.371 --> 01:26:10.457
just a couple of hours ago.
He admitted to his involvement.

01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:13.877
What are you saying? He sent
some stranger to our house to attack her?

01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:18.799
Our detectives found an online post
in Travis Murray's search history.

01:26:20.258 --> 01:26:22.969
It disclosed
Mrs. Dadich's name

01:26:23.053 --> 01:26:26.765
in addition to a photograph
pulled from an online source.

01:26:26.848 --> 01:26:29.476
"I prefer to be taken by surprise?"

01:26:29.559 --> 01:26:33.814
Yeah. It was an ad
listed under the personals

01:26:33.939 --> 01:26:38.694
and intended to portray Mrs. Dadich
as a lonely, unsatisfied housewife

01:26:38.777 --> 01:26:42.823
with a fetish for spontaneous,
submissive sex, preferably with strangers.

01:26:43.865 --> 01:26:48.495
Luckily, our detectives were able to trace
the IP address directly to Robert.

01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:52.290
Robert also admitted to posting
the initial listing

01:26:52.374 --> 01:26:54.543
that provoked the vandalism to your house

01:26:54.626 --> 01:26:56.920
as well as purchasing
the magazine subscriptions.

01:26:57.003 --> 01:27:00.132
Mr. Sorrentino claims
he wasn't trying to inflict harm,

01:27:00.215 --> 01:27:04.010
just trying to scare you all,
hoping you'd forfeit the purchase.

01:27:04.094 --> 01:27:08.515
He nearly had my wife raped and beaten.

01:27:08.598 --> 01:27:12.519
She is so traumatized
she can't sleep in our house.

01:27:12.602 --> 01:27:16.648
He poisoned my dog to death and tried
to do the same fucking thing to me!

01:27:16.732 --> 01:27:18.734
Hey, well, hold on.
Hold on, Mr. Dadich.

01:27:18.817 --> 01:27:23.405
As of now, Mr. Sorrentino denies
ever personally entering the property.

01:27:23.488 --> 01:27:26.700
He says he has no knowledge
of the other attacks against your wife

01:27:26.783 --> 01:27:29.745
- and has never been exposed to the Nerium.
- No shit.

01:27:30.162 --> 01:27:31.788
Of course, he'd fucking deny it.

01:27:31.872 --> 01:27:35.208
Fraud is one thing, but attempted murder?
You're just gonna sit on this shit?

01:27:35.292 --> 01:27:39.504
Hey, listen, we have our men working
around the clock to get a confession.

01:27:39.588 --> 01:27:43.592
We're still holding him on the charges
he's taken responsibility for.

01:27:43.675 --> 01:27:45.510
I thought you said
there's some good news.

01:27:45.594 --> 01:27:47.220
Well, there is.

01:27:47.429 --> 01:27:49.765
Upon questioning him,
we now have reason to believe

01:27:49.848 --> 01:27:54.311
he has a certain level of involvement
with the death of the previous homeowners.

01:27:54.394 --> 01:27:56.897
- How so?
- Well, unbeknownst to Mrs. Sorrentino,

01:27:56.980 --> 01:27:59.524
Robert had accumulated
a significant amount of debt.

01:27:59.608 --> 01:28:03.403
Your house, knowingly left to him
by his brother-in-law...

01:28:03.487 --> 01:28:06.114
Was the only financial venture
he had going.

01:28:10.952 --> 01:28:12.579
I should've listened to you.

01:28:14.122 --> 01:28:15.457
I'm sorry.

01:28:24.883 --> 01:28:30.222
I was just tricking myself
into believing that

01:28:30.305 --> 01:28:34.100
if I just waited it out,
you'd come around.

01:28:36.394 --> 01:28:42.067
But you and I both know that you're never
really gonna trust me again...

01:28:43.610 --> 01:28:45.445
Not 100%.

01:28:53.370 --> 01:28:57.374
I think that we should
talk about separating...

01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:02.504
At least for a little while.

01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:56.850
This is half your grade.
Don't mess around.

01:29:56.933 --> 01:30:00.729
Check in with each other. Check in
with me. I'm here after class.

01:30:01.479 --> 01:30:03.732
Some of you already know that.

01:31:18.431 --> 01:31:20.350
How much did you
pay for those shoes?

01:31:20.433 --> 01:31:22.727
- Oh, you don't wanna know.
- I don't wanna know?

01:31:22.811 --> 01:31:26.189
- 'Cause they look just like...
- Kind of obscene, to be honest.

01:31:29.859 --> 01:31:32.654
You should answer the phone.

01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:36.991
I mean, what's the point?

01:31:37.075 --> 01:31:40.120
She made it very clear that
she doesn't want me to come home.

01:31:40.704 --> 01:31:42.330
She's your wife.

01:31:43.123 --> 01:31:44.791
You should answer the phone.

01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:52.173
Hey, it's me.

01:31:53.258 --> 01:31:54.551
Um...

01:31:56.136 --> 01:31:58.012
I don't even know where to start.

01:31:59.723 --> 01:32:03.059
I'm sorry for what I said last night.

01:32:04.144 --> 01:32:05.729
I didn't mean it.

01:32:06.938 --> 01:32:09.899
I, uh, assume that
you're still at work, but

01:32:09.983 --> 01:32:13.153
if you come home soon, I'd really
love to spend some time with you.

01:32:13.236 --> 01:32:16.740
I love you. I'll be up. Call me.

01:32:24.998 --> 01:32:26.875
I don't get it.

01:32:27.375 --> 01:32:29.377
That's the thing about people.

01:32:31.045 --> 01:32:32.672
They change their minds...

01:32:34.257 --> 01:32:36.217
A lot, actually.

01:32:39.429 --> 01:32:43.641
You know, um, we could just
pick this up tomorrow.

01:32:44.768 --> 01:32:46.060
Kevin.

01:32:48.104 --> 01:32:49.355
Go home.

01:33:13.630 --> 01:33:16.257
Jesus Christ, Natalie.

01:33:17.133 --> 01:33:19.052
Get it together.

01:33:33.066 --> 01:33:35.360
I hate this fucking house.

01:33:40.073 --> 01:33:42.826
- Hello?
- Hey, how's it going?

01:33:43.868 --> 01:33:44.953
Fine.

01:33:45.161 --> 01:33:48.540
- I'm on my way home now.
- Where have you been?

01:33:50.250 --> 01:33:53.419
- You told me not to come home. So...
- When?

01:33:55.380 --> 01:33:57.340
When you texted me.

01:33:58.007 --> 01:34:00.260
Kevin, I didn't text you anything.

01:34:01.469 --> 01:34:03.888
I am looking at
my text messages right now.

01:34:04.722 --> 01:34:07.100
I... I can screenshot you my thread
if you want.

01:36:11.933 --> 01:36:13.267
Hey, how much for the flowers?

01:36:13.351 --> 01:36:15.812
- $8.95.
- They're fresh, right?

01:36:15.895 --> 01:36:16.938
Absolutely.

01:37:16.289 --> 01:37:17.165
My brother?

01:37:17.832 --> 01:37:20.960
Yeah, he had a temper,
but he wasn't a murderer.

01:37:21.502 --> 01:37:24.088
- She had an affair, too?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:37:24.172 --> 01:37:26.549
Some mystery man no one ever heard about.

01:37:27.759 --> 01:37:29.927
Erin designed the house
from the ground up.

01:37:31.179 --> 01:37:32.889
That bitch was up to something.

01:39:10.778 --> 01:39:11.946
Who are you?

01:39:20.955 --> 01:39:22.331
The photos...

01:39:23.666 --> 01:39:25.001
Is that you?

01:39:36.512 --> 01:39:40.266
No, no, no, no! Please, please, please!
I won't scream, I promise!

01:39:42.435 --> 01:39:44.770
I just want to talk to you, okay?

01:39:57.283 --> 01:39:59.202
She brought you here, didn't she?

01:40:01.871 --> 01:40:04.207
Erin?

01:40:06.709 --> 01:40:09.086
She wanted you to be here with her.

01:40:11.047 --> 01:40:13.925
And you loved her.

01:40:18.095 --> 01:40:20.056
After everything that you gave up...

01:40:22.892 --> 01:40:25.228
She still chose him, didn't she?

01:40:44.121 --> 01:40:47.375
I think it's horrible
that she kept you here.

01:40:53.130 --> 01:40:54.674
You didn't deserve that.

01:40:57.134 --> 01:40:58.344
You didn't.

01:42:01.324 --> 01:42:02.158
No, no, no...

01:42:16.172 --> 01:42:17.882
No, no, no, no!
Please, wait, wait, wait!

01:42:17.965 --> 01:42:19.342
Let me help you! I wanna help you.

01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:20.885
Kill him.

01:42:22.178 --> 01:42:26.724
Yeah. I'll help you cover it,
and then we can stay here together.

01:42:30.478 --> 01:42:33.105
He doesn't love me anymore.

01:42:38.444 --> 01:42:41.364
I'm so tired of being alone.

01:43:48.556 --> 01:43:51.058
A little overboard
on the steam, Nat.

01:44:07.241 --> 01:44:10.286
Ah, it's the romantic effort
that counts, I guess.

01:44:26.010 --> 01:44:27.178
There you are.

01:44:27.428 --> 01:44:30.890
I like the sexy scavenger hunt thing.
The bathroom took a hit, though.

01:44:41.942 --> 01:44:45.237
Hey, are you asleep?

01:44:58.167 --> 01:44:59.668
You're so wet.

01:45:17.019 --> 01:45:18.270
Kevin!

01:48:07.189 --> 01:48:09.191
I'm so sorry.

01:48:09.274 --> 01:48:11.652
I love you so much. I'm so sorry.

01:48:12.403 --> 01:48:15.572
It's okay. Come on. Let's go. You're okay.

01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:20.596
Thank God!

01:49:22.264 --> 01:49:24.892
- Hey.
- Jesus Christ!

01:49:24.975 --> 01:49:25.976
Okay!

01:49:26.059 --> 01:49:27.352
You cannot scare me like that.

01:49:27.811 --> 01:49:30.731
Okay, in my defense, I thought
I'd just come through the front door.

01:49:30.814 --> 01:49:33.275
Can you just help me
get this stuff the hell out of here?

01:49:33.358 --> 01:49:36.320
You're doing such a good job
that I don't wanna mess it up.

01:49:36.403 --> 01:49:38.906
- I still have a knife in my hand.
- Uh-huh.

01:49:42.159 --> 01:49:44.203
Why are you looking at me like that?

01:49:44.828 --> 01:49:46.747
You just look good.

01:49:50.584 --> 01:49:52.044
How do I look?

01:49:52.127 --> 01:49:54.463
Okay, and that moment is ruined.

01:49:54.546 --> 01:49:57.424
Oh, I thought I made it better.
I should take that.

01:49:58.258 --> 01:50:01.136
- And, uh, hey, thanks for the gift.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:50:02.471 --> 01:50:04.515
I wasn't gonna keep it, so...

01:50:04.598 --> 01:50:08.185
Hey, guys. I checked all the rooms.
Everything's all clear.

01:50:08.310 --> 01:50:10.187
Unless you wanna send Dave back in there,

01:50:10.270 --> 01:50:12.147
and I honestly wouldn't care
if he came back.

01:50:12.272 --> 01:50:14.608
- That's fine.
- I heard that, Garrett.

01:50:15.317 --> 01:50:16.902
- That mustache has changed you.
- I know.

01:50:16.985 --> 01:50:18.529
- Um, last box?
- Yeah.

01:50:18.612 --> 01:50:20.739
- All right, let's do this.
- Oh, my God.

01:50:22.032 --> 01:50:23.617
- You ready?
- Yeah.

01:50:23.742 --> 01:50:25.118
Come here, bud.

01:50:30.541 --> 01:50:32.209
Should we all wave goodbye to the house?

01:50:32.292 --> 01:50:33.335
Absolutely.

01:50:36.129 --> 01:50:37.339
Bye, house.

01:50:39.341 --> 01:50:41.218
- They almost died.
- Yeah.
