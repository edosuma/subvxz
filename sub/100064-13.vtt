WEBVTT

00:08.542 --> 00:10.310
Sunshine Unit.

00:10.344 --> 00:11.411
Show's over mother‐

00:11.445 --> 00:14.314
How would you like to proceed
Madam President?

00:14.348 --> 00:15.582
Sweet Willem.

00:15.616 --> 00:17.150
[anguished groans]

00:17.184 --> 00:18.552
[screaming and sobbing]

00:20.320 --> 00:21.555
Ready?

00:26.493 --> 00:27.494
The Dark One.

00:27.528 --> 00:28.462
Yeah?

00:28.495 --> 00:29.429
Is gone.

00:29.463 --> 00:30.330
We have to save Jack!

00:30.364 --> 00:33.166
Wait! Her heart!
She's not breathing.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.468
No, no, no!

00:34.501 --> 00:35.235
Somebody help me!

00:35.269 --> 00:36.970
Violet! Vi!
No, no, no, no!!!

00:45.379 --> 00:56.423
[monitor beeping]

00:59.493 --> 01:02.229
We don't have a full account
of what happened.

01:02.262 --> 01:05.465
Jack is stable for now.

01:05.499 --> 01:07.267
I will transport her back
to a hospital

01:07.301 --> 01:10.604
and get her to a point
where she can be debriefed.

01:10.637 --> 01:13.240
Madam President,
without better resources

01:13.273 --> 01:14.207
I don't think she'll make it.

01:14.241 --> 01:16.143
Your chopper took some damage
on the way in.

01:16.176 --> 01:19.646
That's a six‐hour repair.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.715
Do you have any good news,
Colonel?

01:21.748 --> 01:25.719
Or am I better off talking
to Avery or Hansen?

01:28.755 --> 01:32.259
I think I need to fully
brief you.

01:32.292 --> 01:33.694
In private.

01:37.798 --> 01:40.200
Poor kid.

01:40.233 --> 01:42.736
I can't imagine what she's
been through.

01:42.769 --> 01:45.539
They got her all drugged up now.

01:45.572 --> 01:47.407
Strapped her in
so when she comes to

01:47.441 --> 01:51.278
she doesn't hurt herself.

01:51.311 --> 01:53.347
What the hell happened in there?

01:53.380 --> 01:55.215
I don't know.

01:55.248 --> 02:01.088
But whatever it was,
it really messed her up.

02:01.121 --> 02:04.391
Jack... is that you?

02:04.424 --> 02:05.626
Jack?

02:05.659 --> 02:07.294
Save Jack.

02:07.327 --> 02:08.729
Hey.

02:12.432 --> 02:18.405
[loud thunderous sounds]

02:58.445 --> 02:59.079
Madam President‐

02:59.112 --> 03:00.147
That is enough, Colonel.

03:00.180 --> 03:03.417
I want to talk to Avery
and that's the end of it.

03:03.450 --> 03:05.118
Are we clear?

03:06.820 --> 03:08.155
Thank you.

03:10.490 --> 03:11.758
Madam President!

03:11.792 --> 03:13.260
Thank goodness you're here!

03:13.293 --> 03:15.262
You can fix all this!

03:15.295 --> 03:16.263
Fix what, exactly?

03:16.296 --> 03:18.498
My false imprisonment.

03:18.532 --> 03:19.833
If you let me out
I can tell you‐

03:19.866 --> 03:21.802
I am eager to hear your side.

03:21.835 --> 03:22.869
I really am, Avery.

03:22.903 --> 03:25.772
But this arrangement
will be just fine for now.

03:25.806 --> 03:28.775
[stuttering]
Wha‐

03:28.809 --> 03:32.145
I came here to get answers
for you

03:32.179 --> 03:34.448
about Hansen,
his work.

03:34.481 --> 03:36.850
And at every turn
I have been blocked.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.151
Why?

03:38.185 --> 03:41.288
What does Hansen stand
to gain?

03:41.321 --> 03:43.356
Everything.

03:43.390 --> 03:46.293
Don't you realize who he's been
working for all along?

03:46.326 --> 03:48.295
Blak Tek made Daywalkers.

03:48.328 --> 03:51.131
He's been in league with them
from day one.

03:51.164 --> 03:53.200
Where is Hansen?

03:53.233 --> 03:55.769
I'd like to question him,
as well.

03:55.802 --> 03:57.571
Escaped.

03:57.604 --> 03:58.805
Hiding.

03:58.839 --> 04:04.644
The Colonel and his men were
supposed to be hunting for him.

04:13.353 --> 04:16.423
There's a dead body
on the floor.

04:16.456 --> 04:20.660
I had nothing to do with that.

04:20.694 --> 04:23.597
I don't know what the Colonel
has told you,

04:23.630 --> 04:26.700
why he won't unlock the door.

04:26.733 --> 04:29.703
He's probably working
with Hansen.

04:29.736 --> 04:32.105
You can't trust him
or any of his men.

04:32.139 --> 04:34.808
I can prove it.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.278
You're right.

04:38.311 --> 04:40.247
She is fascinating.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.948
And very, very dangerous.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.950
Please, Madam President.

04:43.984 --> 04:46.820
You have to believe me.

04:48.955 --> 04:51.625
You've been married
for a decade?

04:51.658 --> 04:53.360
I worked with your husband
at the state department

04:53.393 --> 04:54.728
before the rising.

04:54.761 --> 04:57.297
Of course.

04:57.330 --> 04:58.899
What's his name?

04:59.900 --> 05:01.334
Madam President...

05:01.368 --> 05:02.435
Where were you born?

05:02.469 --> 05:03.303
What town?

05:03.336 --> 05:03.970
Please...

05:04.004 --> 05:04.938
What is your date of birth?

05:04.971 --> 05:07.541
Your old social security number?

05:07.574 --> 05:10.143
What is your daughter's name?

05:13.914 --> 05:16.950
You won't win.

05:16.983 --> 05:20.720
But you probably know
that by now.

05:20.754 --> 05:24.291
You're just marking time.

05:24.324 --> 05:28.762
You're a dead woman walking
to her own funeral.

05:30.697 --> 05:31.832
Is there a way to kill it?

05:31.865 --> 05:33.033
Not sure.

05:33.066 --> 05:34.801
Sergeant Miller and his men
might know.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.837
They have a unique profile
and understanding.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.638
You're all dead!

05:38.672 --> 05:39.906
All of you!

05:39.940 --> 05:42.609
Each and every one of you!

05:54.955 --> 05:55.856
Kill it?

05:55.889 --> 05:57.924
You gotta take its head.
It's the only way.

05:57.958 --> 06:00.026
Which means opening that door.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.094
Which I don't recommend.

06:01.127 --> 06:01.928
Right.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.363
But if the Dark One
is dead then‐

06:03.396 --> 06:04.464
We don't know that.

06:04.497 --> 06:06.933
But that thing's still alive
and if we open that door

06:06.967 --> 06:09.102
it'll try and kill all of us
the first chance it gets.

06:09.135 --> 06:10.804
I agree, Madam President.

06:10.837 --> 06:12.806
So we're just to leave it
in that sealed room

06:12.839 --> 06:14.307
until the end of time?

06:14.341 --> 06:16.509
That does not sound like
an answer to me.

06:16.543 --> 06:19.613
Until you get better intel
that's your only play.

06:19.646 --> 06:21.615
If Hansen is dead then the only
ones who know anything

06:21.648 --> 06:23.450
are his daughters.

06:23.483 --> 06:24.417
What's their status?

06:24.451 --> 06:26.853
Without a trauma team,
better facilities...

06:26.887 --> 06:29.556
The Sunshine Unit.

06:29.589 --> 06:30.757
That's where Hansen sent Doc.

06:30.790 --> 06:34.995
Supposed to be some kinda
secret high‐level lab.

06:39.799 --> 06:44.037
Yes, well, uh... they went
offline several days ago

06:44.070 --> 06:47.874
and there hasn't been
any communication since.

06:49.042 --> 06:51.011
I could lead a team.

06:51.044 --> 06:52.012
It's not far from here.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.113
Find out what happened.

06:53.146 --> 06:55.815
They maybe lost power,
had an equipment malfunction.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.851
If that's the case I could
bring back a full triage unit,

06:57.884 --> 06:59.819
get those girls stable,
get the answers you need.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.421
I'm going with you.

07:01.454 --> 07:03.523
I gotta find Doc.

07:03.556 --> 07:05.425
This is not a mission
for civilians.

07:05.458 --> 07:07.560
Madam President, I could
use the help.

07:07.594 --> 07:10.430
He has unique abilities.

07:10.463 --> 07:11.998
Same with the Sergeant.

07:12.032 --> 07:13.700
Oorah.

07:13.733 --> 07:15.669
I won't sit around here
on my ass.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.606
[sighs]

07:19.639 --> 07:22.008
Fine.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.944
Put it in motion.

07:23.977 --> 07:25.545
Gentlemen.

07:26.546 --> 07:27.881
Madam.

07:48.702 --> 07:50.804
Stay close.

07:50.837 --> 07:53.406
We need to stick together.

07:53.840 --> 07:56.710
What about those?

07:56.743 --> 07:58.845
No idea.

07:59.346 --> 08:01.047
(Vanessa) I'm here.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.116
I will guide you.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.051
Trust me.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.886
Did you hear that?

08:06.920 --> 08:08.955
It sounded like...

08:08.989 --> 08:10.690
It's Vanessa.

08:16.596 --> 08:17.931
It's me.

08:17.964 --> 08:20.867
I'm right here with you.

08:30.610 --> 08:32.712
Wait.

08:32.746 --> 08:36.149
What if she's in here?

08:43.890 --> 08:48.395
[struggling grunts]

08:57.804 --> 08:59.139
It's not her.

09:00.240 --> 09:04.477
Follow, and all will
become clear.

09:04.511 --> 09:07.647
Her voice.

09:07.680 --> 09:09.883
It's coming from in there.

09:09.916 --> 09:11.818
Jack, wait.

09:22.095 --> 09:24.664
Come, my children.

09:24.697 --> 09:27.801
It is time you knew everything.

09:42.949 --> 09:45.785
Oh, you've come to kill me?

09:45.819 --> 09:48.788
To do what the other
Van Helsings could not.

09:51.458 --> 09:52.992
That's why we were made.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.727
Is that what you believe?

09:54.761 --> 09:57.063
That's what our father told us.

09:57.097 --> 09:57.864
He sacrificed himself‐

09:57.897 --> 10:00.400
So that you could die
for a lie?

10:00.433 --> 10:02.268
Don't listen to her.

10:02.302 --> 10:05.105
We just have to get close
to her and end this.

10:05.138 --> 10:09.275
Well what if the end is merely
just the beginning?

10:09.309 --> 10:14.914
I don't give a shit
about your riddles.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.149
[knife clatters to the ground]

10:16.182 --> 10:20.820
I welcome you here with open
arms and this is how you behave?

10:20.854 --> 10:21.888
Oh, tsk, tsk, tsk.

10:25.825 --> 10:27.427
We need help.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.963
Abraham or Vanessa.

10:29.996 --> 10:31.764
Your mother?

10:33.900 --> 10:35.401
Sit with me.

10:37.871 --> 10:41.107
I will not harm you.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.143
Let me tell you
what you do not know.

10:43.176 --> 10:45.011
You expect us to trust you?

10:45.044 --> 10:48.882
In the end, if you wish,

10:48.915 --> 10:54.988
I will bear my neck to you both
and you can fulfil your destiny.

10:55.021 --> 10:58.224
But it may well be that the
destiny you have been told

10:58.258 --> 11:03.763
is in fact not your destiny
at all.

11:10.904 --> 11:12.472
Mind if I join you?

11:20.880 --> 11:21.881
Are you two close?

11:21.915 --> 11:23.183
Yes.

11:23.216 --> 11:25.018
Oh, Violet, she saved my life.

11:25.051 --> 11:26.519
Hmm.

11:26.553 --> 11:30.123
But Jack just kinda gave it
back to me.

11:32.926 --> 11:37.363
I owe them both,
everything.

11:37.397 --> 11:40.867
And now there's nothing
I can do.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.071
Ten years ago it was me

11:45.104 --> 11:50.109
sitting beside a hospital bed,
powerless.

11:50.143 --> 11:52.345
Praying for a miracle.

11:58.284 --> 12:02.255
My son, Ben, was 12.

12:02.288 --> 12:05.792
He was obsessed with baseball
and wrestling

12:05.825 --> 12:08.127
and books about space travel.

12:08.161 --> 12:10.430
[laughs]

12:10.463 --> 12:15.168
I'll never forget when he hit
three home runs in one game.

12:15.201 --> 12:20.974
The first time he told me
about kissing a girl.

12:23.910 --> 12:29.415
Boy, you don't truly understand
how important those moments are

12:29.449 --> 12:33.219
when they're happening

12:33.253 --> 12:35.555
and how much they hurt
when all you have

12:35.588 --> 12:39.525
is the memory to hang on to.

12:43.529 --> 12:47.500
Um... why are you telling me
all of this?

12:47.533 --> 12:50.970
Well, Ivory, it seems that
in all of this you are

12:51.004 --> 12:56.309
about the closest thing I have
to an ally and I need your help.

12:56.342 --> 12:59.479
Um... I don't think you
really realize‐

12:59.512 --> 13:04.150
I know. I know what you were.

13:04.183 --> 13:08.021
I saw the transformation
with my own eyes.

13:08.054 --> 13:11.190
That's why I'm here.

13:11.224 --> 13:15.328
I need to know everything
that you know.

13:15.361 --> 13:17.030
What we may still be up against.

13:17.063 --> 13:18.631
Those sisters,
what they can do.

13:18.665 --> 13:25.605
That... thing we
have locked away.

13:29.208 --> 13:31.577
Will you help me?

13:35.415 --> 13:38.484
Quietly.

13:38.518 --> 13:41.154
With great calm.

13:41.187 --> 13:44.090
Fate unfolds.

13:47.660 --> 13:53.032
[ragged breathing]
Lies... lies...lies...

13:53.066 --> 13:57.503
it's not‐ it's not the truth...
it's not the truth...

13:57.537 --> 13:59.405
[gasping]

13:59.439 --> 14:04.143
Lies... the truth...
it's not the truth...

14:04.177 --> 14:09.082
Trust. Is it really
so impossible?

14:09.115 --> 14:12.452
You're the reason our family
was ripped apart.

14:15.588 --> 14:17.490
We need to kill her
before she kills us.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.692
This is my domain.

14:19.726 --> 14:22.995
If I wanted you dead
you already would be.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.297
Sit!

14:43.282 --> 14:44.384
Sit.

14:49.288 --> 14:53.526
You need to understand
who your mother really is.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.470
Just as it should be.

15:04.504 --> 15:07.240
The three of us together.

15:12.678 --> 15:14.046
This is Colonel Nicholson
from Bravo Company

15:14.080 --> 15:15.448
calling Sunshine command
and control.

15:15.481 --> 15:17.083
Does anybody copy?

15:32.532 --> 15:34.834
I figured as we get closer we'd
get them on the short wave.

15:34.867 --> 15:35.968
No dice.

15:36.002 --> 15:38.471
How many people are we expecting
at this Sunshine Unit?

15:38.504 --> 15:39.906
Keep six, threes and nines.

15:39.939 --> 15:40.740
10‐4.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.676
Main, support staff,
security detail,

15:43.709 --> 15:45.211
about three dozen.

15:45.244 --> 15:46.846
What if it's not
just a busted radio?

15:46.879 --> 15:48.481
What then?

15:49.415 --> 15:52.919
I will deal with worst case
scenario if it comes to it.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.588
This whole thing is worst case
scenario at this point.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.156
Your pessimism is contagious.

15:57.190 --> 15:58.991
Sunshine Unit, come in.

16:00.092 --> 16:01.527
Sunshine Unit, come in.

16:02.195 --> 16:03.229
Okay, careful.

16:03.262 --> 16:05.164
They still got power.

16:07.133 --> 16:09.836
No signs of struggle.

16:09.869 --> 16:14.173
Maybe they bugged out, or
retreated back to the facility.

16:14.207 --> 16:15.942
Why?

16:15.975 --> 16:17.109
I don't know.

16:17.143 --> 16:18.511
Corporal, get the gate.

16:18.544 --> 16:20.012
Take point.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.152
Come on. Go, go, go.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.766
What's this Sunshine Unit
up to, anyway?

16:40.800 --> 16:42.768
Working on a solution.

16:42.802 --> 16:44.036
We'll leave it at that.

16:44.070 --> 16:45.972
More than just a solution.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.207
This is the place
that blue shit, solicite,

16:48.241 --> 16:50.576
got turned into a vaccine.

16:50.610 --> 16:51.511
How do you know about that?

16:51.544 --> 16:55.815
Avery and Hansen's files
from Fort Collins.

16:55.848 --> 16:56.983
They went from repelling
vampires

16:57.016 --> 16:58.718
to flat out killing them.

16:58.751 --> 17:00.152
That's what Doc
got caught up in.

17:00.186 --> 17:03.055
Judging by Denver that didn't
turn out so good.

17:03.089 --> 17:07.326
The President was committed
to keeping all options open.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.795
Then she saw that broadcast.

17:09.829 --> 17:12.164
Violet turning vampires human.

17:12.198 --> 17:14.567
Objectives changed.

17:17.703 --> 17:19.238
What the hell is this?

17:19.272 --> 17:20.940
This doesn't look so good.

17:20.973 --> 17:22.608
What the hell are we dealing
with here?

17:22.642 --> 17:24.110
Not a clue.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.582
Spread out.

17:38.190 --> 17:40.326
They're here. Go up.

17:40.359 --> 17:41.327
Roger that.

17:41.360 --> 17:42.161
Woah.

17:42.194 --> 17:43.262
[gunfire]

17:43.296 --> 17:44.564
(Julius) Daywalkers?

17:47.233 --> 17:48.801
There's more over here.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.773
(Axel) Not a mark on 'em.

17:54.674 --> 17:57.310
Still got their heads
but dead as disco.

17:58.311 --> 18:00.079
(Julius) What?

18:03.316 --> 18:06.385
This powder, that some new
version of that blue shit?

18:06.419 --> 18:08.621
Maybe they figured it out
this time.

18:08.654 --> 18:09.956
Yeah.

18:15.227 --> 18:16.062
Oh, oh.

18:16.095 --> 18:16.963
Whoa, Julius.

18:16.996 --> 18:18.197
Julius, you all right?

18:18.230 --> 18:18.698
Yeah.

18:18.731 --> 18:19.665
(Axel) You good?

18:19.699 --> 18:20.633
Yeah, I'm okay.

18:20.666 --> 18:21.801
Just got a little dizzy.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.970
I'm good.

18:24.003 --> 18:25.271
I'm okay.

18:39.385 --> 18:42.154
[screaming]

18:42.188 --> 18:43.689
Jesus Christ!

18:43.723 --> 18:47.126
[screaming]

18:58.437 --> 18:59.905
[screaming]

18:59.939 --> 19:01.841
[gun shots]

19:06.912 --> 19:08.014
[snarling]

19:08.047 --> 19:08.714
Jesus Christ!

19:08.748 --> 19:16.355
[gun shots]

19:16.656 --> 19:17.857
Goddammit.

19:18.124 --> 19:19.992
[snarling and growling]

19:20.459 --> 19:21.661
Dammit.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.136
We gotta take its head.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.737
‐Nicholson!
‐Nicholson, get back here!

19:32.938 --> 19:37.777
[fighting grunts]

19:37.810 --> 19:39.245
Goddammit!

19:40.846 --> 19:42.281
[screaming]

19:42.314 --> 19:43.149
Kill it!

19:43.182 --> 19:43.916
[gunshot]

19:43.949 --> 19:45.117
No!

19:45.151 --> 19:47.053
[snarling]

19:48.120 --> 19:48.988
[gunshot]

19:49.021 --> 19:51.757
[gunshot]

19:51.791 --> 19:53.059
[gunshot]

19:56.929 --> 19:58.898
What the hell was that?

19:58.931 --> 20:00.299
What the !

20:01.867 --> 20:03.469
[snarling]

20:03.502 --> 20:06.405
[gunshots]

20:07.039 --> 20:11.110
[fighting grunts]

20:12.878 --> 20:14.747
[fighting grunts]

20:15.781 --> 20:18.184
[snarling and growling]

20:18.217 --> 20:20.920
Axel! Axel!!

20:20.953 --> 20:31.964
[fighting grunts]

20:33.799 --> 20:35.067
I think you got him!

20:35.868 --> 20:39.972
[groans]

20:40.005 --> 20:44.043
Well, whatever this
orange powder did to
the other daywalkers,

20:44.076 --> 20:46.445
it sure as shit did the opposite
to that dude.

20:47.213 --> 20:48.781
You okay?

20:49.849 --> 20:51.150
Yeah.

20:51.183 --> 20:53.219
That thing hit like
a sledgehammer.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.220
You?

20:54.253 --> 20:55.454
Yeah.

20:58.524 --> 21:00.893
Axel?

21:00.926 --> 21:02.528
What?

21:03.362 --> 21:05.264
You ain't healing.

21:10.236 --> 21:12.304
What the hell is happening
to us?

21:14.507 --> 21:16.575
You don't know anything
about our mother.

21:16.609 --> 21:18.410
Oh, sweet child.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.412
Neither do you.

21:20.446 --> 21:22.081
I know you took her from us.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.249
Yes, indeed.

21:23.282 --> 21:26.051
Your mother was taken from you.

21:26.085 --> 21:29.321
Willem told you so many things,
didn't he?

21:29.355 --> 21:31.423
Comforting stories to make
you comply,

21:31.457 --> 21:35.194
to keep you from questions
he didn't want asked.

21:35.227 --> 21:37.329
Like the fact we're
both Van Helsings,

21:37.363 --> 21:39.031
your sworn enemy?

21:39.064 --> 21:40.099
We know that's true.

21:40.132 --> 21:44.937
Did he ever tell you how
you came to be as you are?

21:44.970 --> 21:46.038
He showed us.

21:46.071 --> 21:47.273
Honestly?

21:47.306 --> 21:49.008
All truth?

21:54.146 --> 21:57.449
Lies are like drops of rain.

21:57.483 --> 22:00.953
A few of them seem not to matter
but enough of them,

22:00.986 --> 22:02.855
and you can drown.

22:10.329 --> 22:13.332
[laughs]

22:14.333 --> 22:15.935
He showed you a fiction.

22:15.968 --> 22:19.371
Perhaps now we could tell
the real story.

22:22.675 --> 22:24.210
Dad.

22:24.243 --> 22:25.978
Don't believe it, Jack.

22:26.011 --> 22:28.514
You know she can get inside
our heads.

22:31.350 --> 22:32.318
Jack.

22:33.319 --> 22:34.520
Jack!

22:34.820 --> 22:36.622
Jack, stay here!

22:37.456 --> 22:39.959
As you wish.

22:39.992 --> 22:42.194
She'll face the truth alone.

22:49.168 --> 22:50.603
[frustrated cry]

22:55.507 --> 22:59.511
Do not want this.

22:59.545 --> 23:02.414
Want must surrender to need.

23:02.448 --> 23:04.483
Do not make me betray
them further.

23:04.516 --> 23:08.153
Do you not see why we must?

23:10.389 --> 23:16.428
You are one with me now,
not them.

23:16.462 --> 23:20.332
And they will eternally
be our enemies.

23:20.366 --> 23:25.004
There is only one way
to safeguard ourselves

23:25.037 --> 23:28.440
against their threat.

23:30.175 --> 23:35.047
When the time comes you
must use what I have given you.

23:35.080 --> 23:41.053
The strength that I have bitten
into your blood.

23:41.086 --> 23:44.456
Make what will bring me back
to this world.

23:51.730 --> 23:54.967
Join with them.

23:56.068 --> 23:58.637
Make me a part of them.

24:26.532 --> 24:28.400
This is how we were made?

24:29.234 --> 24:30.569
No.

24:30.602 --> 24:32.271
It's not possible.

24:32.304 --> 24:34.273
The Dark One was locked away
by Abraham centuries

24:34.306 --> 24:36.675
before we were born.

24:36.709 --> 24:37.910
She couldn't have.

24:37.943 --> 24:40.612
I reached out to him much as
Bathory reached out to Vanessa,

24:40.646 --> 24:44.283
or she reached out to you,
in dreams.

24:44.316 --> 24:47.553
In whispered voices and wind.

24:56.795 --> 24:58.464
(Violet) No, Jack,
that's not real.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.432
It's in your head.

25:01.400 --> 25:04.103
Is it done?

25:04.136 --> 25:05.738
As you demanded.

25:05.771 --> 25:07.473
As I must.

25:07.506 --> 25:11.243
For you are my master,
forever and always.

25:11.276 --> 25:12.578
No.

25:12.611 --> 25:16.482
You are his, theirs, mine.

25:16.515 --> 25:19.251
Forever and always.

25:23.255 --> 25:26.592
Everything he said,
a lie within a lie.

25:26.625 --> 25:29.395
Jack, don't listen to her.

25:29.428 --> 25:31.497
He sacrificed himself for us.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.499
He made us.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.100
We're Van Helsings.

25:35.134 --> 25:37.669
You told me not to trust him.

25:37.703 --> 25:40.439
Now I understand why.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.443
Get your hands off her!

25:44.476 --> 25:47.613
Save her from herself... Jack...

25:47.646 --> 25:50.115
[gasps]

25:54.319 --> 25:57.189
What?

25:57.222 --> 25:59.191
Let me go!

25:59.224 --> 26:00.826
Let me go!!

26:00.859 --> 26:03.362
[screaming]

26:03.395 --> 26:07.433
Let me go! Let me go!

26:08.534 --> 26:10.269
Let me go!

26:10.736 --> 26:13.639
[screaming]

26:19.912 --> 26:22.181
Jack! Hey, hey.

26:22.214 --> 26:23.649
Shh, it's okay, it's okay.

26:23.682 --> 26:24.616
It's me. It's Ivory.

26:24.650 --> 26:26.185
It's okay.

26:42.968 --> 26:45.037
And then what happened?

26:45.070 --> 26:47.406
My sister attacked her.

26:47.439 --> 26:48.941
The Dark One?

26:51.110 --> 26:53.312
The next thing I remember,

26:53.345 --> 26:55.380
Violet had pinned her
to the ground.

26:55.414 --> 26:58.050
How?

26:58.083 --> 27:00.319
I don't know.

27:00.352 --> 27:04.123
And were you or your sister
able to bite her?

27:04.156 --> 27:05.757
Or be bitten?

27:05.791 --> 27:06.892
What?

27:06.925 --> 27:08.460
With the special coating
that you have in your blood

27:08.494 --> 27:11.096
that Hansen designed.

27:11.130 --> 27:13.532
So that you could kill
The Dark One.

27:19.471 --> 27:20.405
She needs to rest.

27:20.439 --> 27:22.241
And I promise there
will be time for that

27:22.274 --> 27:24.409
but right now I need answers.

27:24.443 --> 27:26.612
I need to know,
did you succeed?

27:26.645 --> 27:29.481
Is the Dark One dead?

27:35.320 --> 27:37.489
She's gone.

27:37.523 --> 27:39.992
Gone forever.

27:42.294 --> 27:44.062
Get off me!

27:45.230 --> 27:46.999
Let me go!

27:49.301 --> 27:51.537
[struggling grunts]

27:51.570 --> 27:52.504
Let me go!

27:52.538 --> 27:54.039
I have to see‐

27:54.072 --> 28:00.179
[struggling grunts]

28:00.212 --> 28:01.146
Stop!

28:01.180 --> 28:02.114
I have to see Jack!

28:02.147 --> 28:04.216
I tried sedating her
but it didn't last long.

28:04.249 --> 28:05.384
She woke up and went crazy.

28:05.417 --> 28:07.352
Some kind of psychotic break.

28:07.386 --> 28:09.721
Give her a stronger dose.

28:09.755 --> 28:11.223
You gotta listen to me!

28:11.256 --> 28:13.158
You're all gonna die!

28:13.192 --> 28:14.393
You're all gonna die!

28:14.426 --> 28:15.360
Get off!

28:18.263 --> 28:19.331
No!

28:19.364 --> 28:19.998
No!

28:20.032 --> 28:24.403
My sister... get off...

28:24.436 --> 28:26.305
[breathless]

28:28.540 --> 28:30.542
My sister...

28:30.576 --> 28:34.346
[breathless]

28:38.850 --> 28:43.855
My sister... I have
to save her...

28:43.889 --> 28:46.692
Jack. Jack, listen to me.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.193
We have to kill her.

28:48.227 --> 28:49.761
It's no use.

28:49.795 --> 28:54.266
I planted the seed for this
long ago in dreams.

28:54.299 --> 28:55.567
In reality.

28:55.601 --> 28:56.802
What're you talking about?

28:56.835 --> 29:01.240
When you reached out to Abraham
I made contact with your sister.

29:01.273 --> 29:04.376
Part of me entwined with her.

29:04.409 --> 29:05.677
No.

29:05.711 --> 29:07.346
She's too strong for that.

29:07.379 --> 29:08.347
Is she‐

29:11.116 --> 29:13.418
My beloved Bathory took her
on the next step.

29:13.452 --> 29:17.189
She accessed her mind, leaving
the seed there to take root,

29:17.222 --> 29:24.263
grow, thrive, until this time
came when we were reunited.

29:24.296 --> 29:26.098
Hmm?

29:26.131 --> 29:27.332
Jack.

29:28.200 --> 29:29.334
Jack.

29:29.368 --> 29:30.669
Fight this.

29:33.472 --> 29:35.173
Fight her.

29:35.774 --> 29:40.245
It's not too late for you
to join with us, you know.

29:40.279 --> 29:41.480
Never gonna happen.

29:41.513 --> 29:44.316
Oh, but it already has,
don't you see?

29:44.349 --> 29:47.552
You both played
right into my hand.

29:47.586 --> 29:48.754
Ah!

29:48.787 --> 29:52.791
(Dark One) I laid a path
for you, as well, long ago.

29:52.824 --> 29:53.859
(Violet) No.

30:00.365 --> 30:02.100
[thunder rolls]

30:02.134 --> 30:07.606
Violet. It's okay.

30:08.473 --> 30:10.876
Don't be afraid.

30:12.477 --> 30:14.146
No.

30:14.179 --> 30:16.515
It wasn't you.

30:16.548 --> 30:17.482
It was Vanessa.

30:17.516 --> 30:19.284
I laid a trap for you both.

30:19.318 --> 30:23.855
It brought you here to serve
in my salvation!

30:23.889 --> 30:25.223
No!

30:27.559 --> 30:30.629
You have made this
moment possible.

30:30.662 --> 30:35.367
Your ignorant self believe
your father's foolishness.

30:35.400 --> 30:38.637
He saw you for what you are.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.305
A cancer to be cut out!

30:40.339 --> 30:42.307
Willem turned against me.

30:42.341 --> 30:45.277
He lacked faith in my supremacy.

30:45.310 --> 30:46.445
[cries out]
Argh!!!

30:46.478 --> 30:49.848
A piece of humanity
that never left his soul.

30:49.881 --> 30:54.453
I offered him eternal life
and he threw it all away.

30:54.486 --> 30:55.954
For what?

30:58.357 --> 31:00.158
And now, my beloved,

31:02.561 --> 31:06.365
it is time you serve
your purpose.

31:23.682 --> 31:26.852
Oh, Abraham.

31:26.885 --> 31:30.689
[chuckles]

31:30.722 --> 31:33.692
My saviour after all.

31:37.562 --> 31:39.464
You've got the colour back
in your cheeks.

31:39.498 --> 31:40.432
Good.

31:40.465 --> 31:42.334
We'll get you to 100 percent
when we're back

31:42.367 --> 31:44.236
in the real world.

31:44.269 --> 31:46.505
Real world?

31:46.538 --> 31:47.873
Well, we can't stay here,
Jack.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.608
You're too crucial
to our objectives.

31:49.641 --> 31:51.543
We need to take you
someplace safe

31:51.576 --> 31:55.781
so we can talk about everything.

31:55.814 --> 31:57.516
Notify my security detail.

31:57.549 --> 31:58.617
Prep the chopper.

31:58.650 --> 32:00.452
Wheels up in 30 minutes.

32:00.485 --> 32:01.586
Yes, ma'am.

32:01.620 --> 32:02.754
Well, what about me?

32:02.788 --> 32:04.022
And Violet?

32:04.055 --> 32:06.725
Ivory, you're mission critical.

32:06.758 --> 32:09.728
I'm counting on your help.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.563
We'll get her healthy,
I promise.

32:11.596 --> 32:13.899
Don't worry.

32:13.932 --> 32:16.835
We want the same things.

32:19.738 --> 32:22.474
Madam President,

32:22.507 --> 32:26.611
my sister, I'd like to see her
before we leave.

32:26.645 --> 32:28.013
Of course.

32:48.533 --> 32:52.938
Would you mind if we had
a moment?

32:55.440 --> 32:56.875
Of course.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.459
Hi, Violet.

33:15.460 --> 33:18.363
I know you can hear me.

33:18.396 --> 33:22.334
I just wanted to say
thank you.

33:22.367 --> 33:24.669
If it weren't for you
I wouldn't be here.

33:36.515 --> 33:39.684
But you shouldn't
have tried to stop me.

33:40.285 --> 33:46.458
Once I opened that portal again
jumping in after me was futile.

33:47.526 --> 33:49.561
Now you're trapped here.

33:49.594 --> 33:51.796
Like this.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.769
And I'm free.

34:08.046 --> 34:18.557
[anguished screaming]

34:35.373 --> 34:37.976
We really need to be going.

34:38.009 --> 34:40.278
Yes.

34:40.312 --> 34:41.980
But a question.

34:42.013 --> 34:42.948
Sure.

34:45.884 --> 34:55.160
This real world, you are
in charge there?

34:55.193 --> 34:59.297
Some would argue that,
but yes, I am.

34:59.331 --> 35:05.170
And the people,
safe from all this?

35:05.203 --> 35:07.505
How many?

35:07.539 --> 35:09.074
Millions.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.709
Why?

35:10.742 --> 35:15.747
You must find that power
intoxicating.

35:15.780 --> 35:21.152
Uh... Jack, you've...
you've been through a lot.

35:21.186 --> 35:25.023
I'm sure this all must be very
confusing for you.

35:25.056 --> 35:28.360
No, Madam President.

35:28.393 --> 35:33.031
It's created a hunger.
A thirst.

35:33.064 --> 35:37.302
Jack, what‐ stop this,
Jack.

35:38.069 --> 35:45.076
I've had paupers and fools,
emperors and statesmen.

35:45.110 --> 35:49.748
Power has a very unique taste.

35:49.781 --> 35:53.084
But death, it's all the same.

35:53.118 --> 35:55.887
Desperate and wanting.

35:55.920 --> 35:57.222
[gasps]

35:57.255 --> 35:58.857
Jack!

36:17.008 --> 36:18.543
Where's Jack?

36:18.943 --> 36:21.546
She's already on board
the helicopter.

36:25.850 --> 36:28.253
So what're you doing here?

36:28.286 --> 36:34.359
I came to see the captive
one last time.

36:37.929 --> 36:40.965
I know what it's like
to be trapped.

36:41.633 --> 36:48.239
The ache to be back with those
you love and desire.

36:52.644 --> 36:56.448
The last time we saw each other

36:56.481 --> 37:00.018
I had great reason
to be suspicious.

37:00.051 --> 37:03.621
I made a mistake.

37:03.655 --> 37:05.490
One I deeply regret.

37:05.523 --> 37:08.026
You could atone for it.

37:08.059 --> 37:09.227
Do you wish for that?

37:09.260 --> 37:11.362
More than anything.

37:11.396 --> 37:13.131
I swear it.

37:22.073 --> 37:22.974
Release her.

37:23.007 --> 37:23.842
Madam President?

37:23.875 --> 37:24.609
You can't.

37:24.642 --> 37:25.543
I can.

37:25.577 --> 37:28.847
I am the president,
I can do as I wish.

37:28.880 --> 37:31.349
Is it not your job to follow
my orders?

37:31.683 --> 37:33.485
Then open the door
and let her out.

37:33.518 --> 37:35.186
Don't do this, okay?

37:35.220 --> 37:36.988
She's gonna kill all of you.

37:37.021 --> 37:38.223
She told you that she would!

37:38.256 --> 37:38.757
No!

37:38.790 --> 37:39.958
Get her out of here!

37:39.991 --> 37:40.859
No!

37:41.593 --> 37:42.627
[snap]

37:46.064 --> 37:47.098
Hmm.

37:48.666 --> 37:49.834
Ma'am.

37:50.502 --> 37:51.903
You killed her.

37:51.936 --> 37:55.006
She wanted me dead,
you hesitated.

37:55.039 --> 37:57.075
You. Open the door.

37:57.108 --> 37:58.109
Now!

38:06.217 --> 38:10.889
[inhales deeply]

38:17.061 --> 38:18.263
Not a step closer.

38:18.296 --> 38:20.498
You don't need your weapon
with her.

38:27.372 --> 38:30.175
You see?

38:32.310 --> 38:35.246
She's as meek as a baby lamb.

39:12.784 --> 39:14.152
No, no, no.

39:14.185 --> 39:15.220
Please.

39:15.253 --> 39:16.421
Please untie me.

39:16.454 --> 39:17.322
I'm sorry.

39:17.355 --> 39:19.023
I have orders.

39:23.127 --> 39:24.462
You put that needle
in her arm

39:24.495 --> 39:27.098
and that's gonna be the last
thing you ever do.

39:27.131 --> 39:28.466
Untie her.

39:28.499 --> 39:29.534
Now!

39:33.705 --> 39:36.741
Come on, come on.

39:36.774 --> 39:38.343
There's gotta be somebody here.

39:39.410 --> 39:42.714
[groaning]

39:43.781 --> 39:44.549
Hey!

39:45.316 --> 39:46.217
Hey!

39:47.452 --> 39:48.786
[groaning]

39:48.820 --> 39:50.722
Anybody in there?!

39:50.755 --> 39:51.890
Axel, I...

39:59.564 --> 40:00.732
Shit.

40:01.366 --> 40:02.600
Axel...

40:09.073 --> 40:09.641
Come here, buddy.

40:09.674 --> 40:10.942
I can't. I can't.

40:10.975 --> 40:12.043
Come on.

40:12.076 --> 40:14.345
I... I...

40:15.513 --> 40:17.248
What's happening?

40:23.621 --> 40:24.956
No, no, no, no, no, no.

40:24.989 --> 40:26.391
No, no, no, no, no, no.

40:26.424 --> 40:28.259
Come on. Come on.

40:37.502 --> 40:39.470
Come on! Come on!

40:42.440 --> 40:45.043
[groans]

40:47.612 --> 40:53.451
Hey, Doc!

40:53.484 --> 40:54.819
Doc?

40:55.320 --> 40:58.990
If you're in there, open up.

41:00.725 --> 41:02.794
Don't leave us out here.

41:07.131 --> 41:10.735
[helicopter whirring]

41:19.877 --> 41:20.878
We can't let them leave!

41:20.912 --> 41:21.779
Where's Jack?

41:21.813 --> 41:22.547
She never made it back!

41:22.580 --> 41:24.482
She's trapped in the Dark Realm!

41:25.483 --> 41:26.651
The grenade launcher!

41:31.990 --> 41:33.024
[explosion]

41:36.494 --> 41:44.569
[gunfire]

42:22.907 --> 42:23.975
Hey!

42:25.109 --> 42:26.778
Hey!

42:26.811 --> 42:28.746
Somebody let me out!

42:28.780 --> 42:31.115
Somebody help!

42:31.149 --> 42:32.517
Somebody!

42:32.550 --> 42:33.418
Help!

42:33.451 --> 42:35.019
(Vanessa's voice)
Don't lose hope.

42:35.053 --> 42:36.587
I'm right here.

42:42.060 --> 42:50.868
[muffled screaming]
...Somebody help!!!
