Malcolm, I think

00:34.827 --> 00:37.162
you should say something

to your classmates.

Nothing.

01:39.016 --> 01:40.976
You look different.

01:41.018 --> 01:42.310
I took a shower.

01:42.352 --> 01:43.270

legislature-sponsored initiative

01:49.568 --> 01:52.362
of overanalyzing past

01:49.568 --> 01:52.362
and current positions,

01:52.404 --> 01:54.155
aimed toward curbing this type

01:52.404 --> 01:54.155
of governmental interference.

01:54.197 --> 01:57.659
In international news,

01:54.197 --> 01:57.659
boring, boring, boring.

01:57.701 --> 01:59.078
I'm incredibly boring.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.329
Do you know who's boring? Me.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.791
Boring, goring, zoring,

02:01.371 --> 02:03.791
loring, doring, noring, foring.

02:03.832 --> 02:06.167

(cartoons playing)

02:16.887 --> 02:19.222
What? I took a shower.

02:19.264 --> 02:20.766
Is that a crime?

02:20.808 --> 02:23.184
Reese, is this going

02:20.808 --> 02:23.184
to be a daily thing?

02:23.226 --> 02:24.645
Because we got a schedule...

02:24.686 --> 02:28.023
Honey, let me

02:24.686 --> 02:28.023
handle this.

02:28.065 --> 02:30.191
Son, are you on drugs?

02:30.233 --> 02:31.986
No, it's just...

02:32.027 --> 02:34.446
Why doesn't everyone

02:32.027 --> 02:34.446
just leave me alone?!

02:36.115 --> 02:38.700
Wow. Usually we don't get

02:36.115 --> 02:38.700
someone storming off

02:38.742 --> 02:41.202
from the table

02:38.742 --> 02:41.202

Hey, kids, it's a new,

02:42.496 --> 02:44.289
improved sleepy-time Herbie,

02:44.331 --> 02:46.249
now with super-sleepy

02:44.331 --> 02:46.249
fuzzy fur.

02:46.291 --> 02:48.585
I'm sleepy.

02:48.627 --> 02:50.129
Herbie's not available

02:48.627 --> 02:50.129
in stores.

02:50.169 --> 02:51.212
Order yours now

02:51.254 --> 02:53.090
through this special TV offer.

02:53.132 --> 02:54.299
(yawns) Hi, Dewey.

02:54.341 --> 02:55.676
I can make you happy.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.511
I can make your brothers

02:55.717 --> 02:57.511
be nice to you.

02:57.552 --> 03:00.263
I can get you out of school.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.850
Your parents want

03:00.305 --> 03:02.850
to buy me for you.

03:02.891 --> 03:04.935
All you got to do is ask them.

03:04.977 --> 03:06.645
They're right there

03:04.977 --> 03:06.645
in the kitchen.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.022
Why don't you go ask them?

03:08.063 --> 03:10.107
Go on. Yeah.

03:10.149 --> 03:11.358
Go ask them.

03:12.275 --> 03:13.902
Can you buy me

03:12.275 --> 03:13.902
a Herbie?

03:13.944 --> 03:16.404
No, they're too expensive.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.615
Maybe. Ask me again

03:16.446 --> 03:18.615
in four seconds.

03:18.657 --> 03:22.243
Can you buy me a Herbie,  please?

03:22.285 --> 03:23.537
Didn't you just hear me?

03:23.578 --> 03:24.746
I said no.

03:24.788 --> 03:26.247
Ask louder.

03:26.289 --> 03:30.878
Son, what were you thinking?!

03:30.919 --> 03:33.254
Stealing 200 frogs

03:30.919 --> 03:33.254
from the biology lab

03:33.296 --> 03:35.256
and setting them loose

03:33.296 --> 03:35.256
on the highway!

03:35.298 --> 03:38.259
I was freeing the

03:35.298 --> 03:38.259
alleged frog, sir.

03:38.301 --> 03:41.262
Killing live animals in the

03:38.301 --> 03:41.262
name of science is inhumane.

03:41.304 --> 03:44.265
No! Inhumane is

03:41.304 --> 03:44.265
sitting in a car

03:44.307 --> 03:46.267
for two and a half hours

03:46.309 --> 03:49.270
when I live only eight blocks

03:46.309 --> 03:49.270
from campus.

03:49.312 --> 03:50.313
Sir, I didn't mean to...

03:50.355 --> 03:51.773
I am very tired

03:51.815 --> 03:54.568
of all the things

03:51.815 --> 03:54.568
that you didn't mean to do.

03:54.609 --> 03:57.445
You didn't mean to come in

03:54.609 --> 03:57.445
four hours after curfew.

03:57.487 --> 04:00.281
You didn't mean to replace

03:57.487 --> 04:00.281
the morning reveille record

04:00.323 --> 04:03.368
with a selection from

04:00.323 --> 04:03.368
trip-hop wizard Tricky.

04:03.410 --> 04:06.496
Maybe I should

04:03.410 --> 04:06.496
just rename this

04:06.538 --> 04:10.291
"Francis's

04:06.538 --> 04:10.291
'I didn't mean to' file."

04:10.333 --> 04:12.211
That would be

04:10.333 --> 04:12.211
a bold choice, sir.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.503
Glibness.

04:13.545 --> 04:14.963
What a surprise.

04:15.005 --> 04:18.466
I'm giving you exactly

04:15.005 --> 04:18.466
ten seconds to tell me

04:18.508 --> 04:21.302
why I shouldn't put you

04:18.508 --> 04:21.302
on latrine detail

04:21.344 --> 04:23.222
for the rest of this semester.

04:23.263 --> 04:26.225
Okay. Um, why shouldn't

04:23.263 --> 04:26.225
I have to clean toilets

04:26.266 --> 04:28.227
for the next three months?

04:28.268 --> 04:30.145
It's an intriguing question.

04:30.187 --> 04:31.688
Is that a new tie, sir?

04:31.730 --> 04:33.481
Four seconds.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.400
What a beautiful beach.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.318
Did you take this, sir?

04:35.442 --> 04:37.318
'Cause...

04:37.360 --> 04:41.115
you've certainly captured

04:37.360 --> 04:41.115
your young male friend's Speedo.

04:41.156 --> 04:42.950
That is a picture of me.

04:42.991 --> 04:44.325
Now, if I were you,

04:44.367 --> 04:47.370
I wouldn't try

04:44.367 --> 04:47.370
to distract me and...

04:55.545 --> 04:56.838
Sir?

04:58.381 --> 04:59.633
Sir?

04:59.674 --> 05:01.009
Hmm?

05:03.386 --> 05:04.846
That'll be all, Cadet.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.480
(sobbing)

05:22.405 --> 05:24.365
(sobbing stops)

05:24.407 --> 05:25.826
Were you crying?

05:25.867 --> 05:27.368
No, I was reading.

05:27.410 --> 05:28.369
You don't read.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.330
Just shut the door, Krelboyne.

05:32.415 --> 05:34.417
(sobbing resumes)

05:36.419 --> 05:38.005
I'm still in here, perv!

05:40.924 --> 05:42.383
(sobbing)

05:42.425 --> 05:44.136
Ha! You're crying.

05:45.262 --> 05:46.930
Oh, man. You're crying.

05:48.849 --> 05:51.226
You don't want

05:48.849 --> 05:51.226
to talk about it, do you?

05:51.268 --> 05:53.645
It's about a girl.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.438
I should've just walked away.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.565
Wendy Finnerman-- she hates me.

05:57.607 --> 05:59.109
I don't know what to do.

05:59.151 --> 06:01.402
I've tried everything

05:59.151 --> 06:01.402
to make her like me.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.362
(girls chattering)

06:05.490 --> 06:07.909
(laughing)

06:09.536 --> 06:12.371
(laughing)

06:14.833 --> 06:17.044
(laughing)

06:22.132 --> 06:24.425
I'm toilet-papering

06:22.132 --> 06:24.425
her house tonight.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.803
If that doesn't work,

06:24.467 --> 06:26.803
I'm out of ideas.

06:26.845 --> 06:29.097
Look, Reese,

06:26.845 --> 06:29.097
maybe I can help you.

06:29.139 --> 06:30.431
What am I

06:29.139 --> 06:30.431
supposed to do?

06:30.473 --> 06:32.017
I don't know.

06:32.059 --> 06:34.311
Just try anything

06:32.059 --> 06:34.311
that doesn't make her cry.

06:35.394 --> 06:36.604
I guess you could start off

06:36.646 --> 06:38.273
by finding out stuff about her.

06:38.315 --> 06:40.150
You know, do the things

06:38.315 --> 06:40.150
she likes to do.

06:40.192 --> 06:42.944
Is that before or after

06:40.192 --> 06:42.944
I go T.P. her house?

06:42.986 --> 06:44.112
Instead.

06:44.154 --> 06:46.114
All right.

06:46.156 --> 06:47.406
I'll try it your way.

06:48.491 --> 06:49.450
Thanks.

06:49.492 --> 06:51.161
No problem.

06:51.203 --> 06:53.038
I know I'm going

06:51.203 --> 06:53.038
to pay for this, but...

06:53.080 --> 06:54.331
(singsongy):

06:53.080 --> 06:54.331
Reese loves Wendy.

06:54.373 --> 06:56.166
Reese loves Wendy.

06:56.208 --> 06:57.376
Come here! Stay here!

06:56.208 --> 06:57.376
Ha-ha!

06:57.416 --> 06:58.626
(chanting):

06:57.416 --> 06:58.626
Go Wildcats, go!

06:58.668 --> 07:00.670
Go Wildcats, go, go!

07:00.712 --> 07:03.382
Go Wildcats,

07:00.712 --> 07:03.382
go, go!

07:03.422 --> 07:05.466
Go Wildcats, go, go!

07:05.508 --> 07:07.219
(cheering)

07:18.105 --> 07:20.065
That's it.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.482
(screams)

07:21.524 --> 07:23.735
Reese!

07:30.450 --> 07:31.534
Reese, why are you

07:30.450 --> 07:31.534
dressed like that?!

07:31.576 --> 07:33.078
I figured out

07:31.576 --> 07:33.078
what she likes.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.704
I saw her cheering

07:33.120 --> 07:34.704
for the football team,

07:34.746 --> 07:36.497
so I joined the

07:34.746 --> 07:36.497
cheerleading squad.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.792
Why didn't you join

07:36.539 --> 07:38.792
the football team, doofus?

07:38.833 --> 07:41.502
She's a cheerleader.

07:41.544 --> 07:42.963
Reese, you're a guy.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.757
Guy cheerleaders

07:43.004 --> 07:45.757
are the lowest of the low,

07:45.799 --> 07:49.344
worse than band,

07:45.799 --> 07:49.344
worse than Krelboynes.

07:49.386 --> 07:50.678
The only thing lower is that guy

07:50.720 --> 07:52.680
that never takes

07:50.720 --> 07:52.680
his hand out of his butt.

07:52.722 --> 07:53.723
Oh, Chester?

07:53.765 --> 07:55.142
He's a cheerleader, too.

07:55.183 --> 07:56.684
Does a lot of solo work.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.019
I tried to help him.

07:58.061 --> 07:59.396
I gave him advice.

07:59.438 --> 08:01.315
I tried reasoning with him.

08:01.356 --> 08:03.524
There's only one

08:01.356 --> 08:03.524
thing left to do:

08:03.566 --> 08:05.610
sit back and

08:03.566 --> 08:05.610
laugh my ass off.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.487
Good luck.

08:10.031 --> 08:12.367
Come in, Cadet.

08:12.409 --> 08:13.576
Look, sir...

08:13.618 --> 08:15.578
I have the floor.

08:17.580 --> 08:20.541
In the short time that

08:17.580 --> 08:20.541
you have been under my care,

08:20.583 --> 08:23.378
we have had

08:20.583 --> 08:23.378
our share of conflicts.

08:23.420 --> 08:26.006
In all my efforts

08:23.420 --> 08:26.006
to get through to you,

08:26.047 --> 08:29.468
I have tried

08:26.047 --> 08:29.468
every method I know how.

08:29.509 --> 08:30.844
And besides

08:29.509 --> 08:30.844
mental and physical abuse, sir,

08:30.885 --> 08:32.804
exactly which methods

08:30.885 --> 08:32.804
would those be?

08:34.973 --> 08:37.267
This photo made me

08:34.973 --> 08:37.267
realize something.

08:37.309 --> 08:39.853
I used to be like you.

08:39.894 --> 08:42.605
Insolent, arrogant, cavalier.

08:42.647 --> 08:45.566
Sir, I...

08:42.647 --> 08:45.566
Floor!

08:45.608 --> 08:47.486
Now, son, you are

08:47.527 --> 08:49.988
on the precipice.

08:55.494 --> 08:57.578
Now, I am going

08:55.494 --> 08:57.578
to tell you a story

08:57.620 --> 09:00.665
about my life, in the hopes

08:57.620 --> 09:00.665
of finally getting you

09:00.707 --> 09:02.501
to straighten yourself out.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.878
Now, in the coming hours,

09:02.542 --> 09:04.878
you are going to hear things

09:04.919 --> 09:06.587
that are going to horrify you.

09:06.629 --> 09:09.090
It sounds illuminating, sir,

09:06.629 --> 09:09.090
but I have biology.

09:09.132 --> 09:10.591
I've taken the liberty

09:10.633 --> 09:13.011
of canceling

09:10.633 --> 09:13.011
your next three classes.

09:14.095 --> 09:18.433
Son, do you know

09:14.095 --> 09:18.433
what a wet nurse is?

09:36.826 --> 09:39.204
Dewey, have you forgotten me?

09:36.826 --> 09:39.204
I thought we were friends.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.830
All of the boys and girls

09:40.872 --> 09:43.208
on your street are my friends.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.625
They all bought me.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.794
Your parents have lots of money.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.213
They're just hiding it.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.673
But I don't want you

09:48.255 --> 09:50.673
to buy me for me.

09:50.715 --> 09:52.300
It's for your own good.

09:52.342 --> 09:54.052
I didn't want to tell you this,

09:54.094 --> 09:56.721
but if you don't buy me,

09:54.094 --> 09:56.721
you'll die.

09:58.473 --> 10:00.641
Honestly, Hal, I don't know

09:58.473 --> 10:00.641
what's wrong with Reese.

10:00.683 --> 10:02.352
Oh, he's just

10:00.683 --> 10:02.352
a little slow.

10:02.394 --> 10:04.271
No. I mean the way

10:02.394 --> 10:04.271
he's been acting.

10:04.312 --> 10:06.273
Hey, Mom, where's the iron?

10:06.314 --> 10:07.524
Ah.

10:09.192 --> 10:11.027
It's a girl.

10:11.069 --> 10:12.946
Hal, it's time

10:11.069 --> 10:12.946
for the talk.

10:12.987 --> 10:14.655
I don't know

10:12.987 --> 10:14.655
what you mean.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.366
The talk, Hal.

10:16.408 --> 10:18.659
Oh, geez, he's a little young,

10:16.408 --> 10:18.659
don't you think?

10:18.701 --> 10:21.288
You waited so long with Francis;

10:18.701 --> 10:21.288
look what happened there.

10:21.329 --> 10:23.664
All right,

10:21.329 --> 10:23.664
but if I'm giving the talk,

10:23.706 --> 10:25.542
all three boys are getting it

10:23.706 --> 10:25.542
at the same time.

10:25.584 --> 10:26.918
And I'm not doing it again.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.087
So if we have any more kids,

10:26.960 --> 10:29.087
they're on their own.

10:30.797 --> 10:34.509
Mom, Dad,

10:30.797 --> 10:34.509
I'd really like a Herbie doll.

10:34.551 --> 10:37.471
I know it's expensive,

10:34.551 --> 10:37.471
but I don't ask for a lot.

10:37.512 --> 10:39.306
And I've been

10:37.512 --> 10:39.306
very good lately.

10:39.347 --> 10:42.392
I want it! I want it!

10:42.434 --> 10:44.685
I want it! I want it! I want it!

10:44.727 --> 10:46.396
Looks like he

10:44.727 --> 10:46.396
found the sugar.

10:46.438 --> 10:49.899
Oh, doesn't he look

10:46.438 --> 10:49.899
just like a little dust mop?

10:49.941 --> 10:51.109
(chanting):

10:49.941 --> 10:51.109
Ready? Hit it.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.903
B-E A-G-G-R-E-S-S-I-V-E!

10:54.737 --> 10:57.865
B-E A-G-G-R-E-S-S-I-V-E!

10:57.907 --> 10:59.534
(clapping rhythmically)

10:59.576 --> 11:01.161
What's that spell?

11:01.202 --> 11:02.203
Be aggressive!

11:02.245 --> 11:03.913
B-E aggressive!

11:03.955 --> 11:06.166
V-I-C-T-O-R-Y.

11:06.207 --> 11:08.709
That's the Wildcats' battle cry!

11:08.751 --> 11:10.795
What a... geek.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.797
I never thought...

11:12.839 --> 11:14.382
I'd get... to say that.

11:14.424 --> 11:15.925
Oh, my God.

11:15.967 --> 11:18.428
I'm a Krelboyne with a

11:15.967 --> 11:18.428
brother who's a cheerleader.

11:18.470 --> 11:20.013
I could wet my

11:18.470 --> 11:20.013
pants in public,

11:20.054 --> 11:21.722
and it would be

11:20.054 --> 11:21.722
a lateral move.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.724
...O-R-Y.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.393
That's the Wildcats' battle cry!

11:26.353 --> 11:27.437
Success!

11:27.479 --> 11:28.729
Victory, success!

11:28.771 --> 11:30.357
Victory, yes!

11:30.398 --> 11:33.193
Ow! Ow!

11:33.234 --> 11:35.529
So clumsy.

11:33.234 --> 11:35.529
(girls murmuring)

11:35.570 --> 11:36.737
Hey, Malcolm,

11:36.779 --> 11:39.740
you think your brother

11:36.779 --> 11:39.740
will lend me his corset?

11:39.782 --> 11:41.451
When a Krelboyne

11:39.782 --> 11:41.451
makes fun of you,

11:41.493 --> 11:42.827
you know you're

11:41.493 --> 11:42.827
in trouble.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.787
See, that comment was

11:42.869 --> 11:44.787
playing off the concept

11:44.829 --> 11:46.831
that we all have

11:44.829 --> 11:46.831
specific notions

11:46.873 --> 11:49.209
of gender-appropriate roles.

11:49.250 --> 11:50.835
At least they're

11:49.250 --> 11:50.835
no good at it.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.379
So there we were--

11:52.420 --> 11:54.755
the ocean,

11:52.420 --> 11:54.755
my stepfather and me.

11:54.797 --> 11:56.757
As the storm raged overhead,

11:56.799 --> 11:59.594
he made one final lunge

11:56.799 --> 11:59.594
for the rudder.

11:59.636 --> 12:02.930
I ripped it from his hands

11:59.636 --> 12:02.930
and stared him down.

12:02.972 --> 12:06.184
He knew that I was prepared

12:02.972 --> 12:06.184
to kill him.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.935
I left port

12:07.977 --> 12:10.355
that day a 16-year-old boy.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.731
I returned a man.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.486
That was an amazing

12:14.401 --> 12:16.486
story, sir.

12:16.528 --> 12:18.697
I mean, I was

12:16.528 --> 12:18.697
skeptical at first,

12:18.737 --> 12:20.990
but we do have

12:18.737 --> 12:20.990
something in common.

12:21.032 --> 12:24.785
I mean, look at the way

12:21.032 --> 12:24.785
both our mothers abandoned us.

12:24.827 --> 12:26.787
What are you talking about?

12:26.829 --> 12:28.415
You know, how I was

12:26.829 --> 12:28.415
shipped off here

12:28.456 --> 12:30.584
and you were left with your

12:28.456 --> 12:30.584
wet nurse for all those years.

12:30.625 --> 12:33.794
That story had nothing

12:30.625 --> 12:33.794
to do with my mother.

12:33.836 --> 12:37.798
It had to do with me

12:33.836 --> 12:37.798
finally taking responsibility

12:37.840 --> 12:39.384
for my own actions.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.802
Just sounded like she may

12:39.426 --> 12:41.802
have been a little bit distant.

12:41.844 --> 12:44.097
Well, that is none

12:41.844 --> 12:44.097
of your business.

12:44.138 --> 12:47.267
I swear, you are absolutely

12:44.138 --> 12:47.267
fixated on mothers.

12:47.308 --> 12:48.685
I am not fixated.

12:48.727 --> 12:50.186
Can you name one thing

12:48.727 --> 12:50.186
in your life

12:50.228 --> 12:51.854
that you don't blame

12:50.228 --> 12:51.854
on your mother?

12:51.896 --> 12:53.772
Sure.

12:56.735 --> 12:59.696
(grunts) I'm sorry.

12:56.735 --> 12:59.696
I was just giving an opinion!

12:59.738 --> 13:02.657
Well, it's that pop

12:59.738 --> 13:02.657
psychology nonsense that's...

13:02.699 --> 13:04.825
It is nothing to get

13:02.699 --> 13:04.825
defensive about.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.536
I am not defensive.

13:06.578 --> 13:09.830
Every time anybody

13:06.578 --> 13:09.830
denies a lie,

13:09.872 --> 13:11.499
they're called defensive.

13:11.541 --> 13:13.460
Fine. I take it back.

13:11.541 --> 13:13.460
Your mother was a saint.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.794
I am not saying

13:13.501 --> 13:15.794
that at all.

13:16.963 --> 13:18.839
Does this look anything

13:16.963 --> 13:18.839
like a "Q"?

13:18.881 --> 13:20.216
Reese, just stop this.

13:20.258 --> 13:21.760
You're acting like a moron.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.844
And you're making no

13:21.800 --> 13:23.844
progress with Wendy.

13:23.886 --> 13:26.222
And what the hell do you

13:23.886 --> 13:26.222
need a "Q" for anyway?

13:26.264 --> 13:28.266
You're right. I'm terrible.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.893
I'm just not coordinated

13:28.308 --> 13:30.893
unless I'm hitting somebody.

13:30.935 --> 13:33.020
But I really like her.

13:33.062 --> 13:34.689
I have to get good.

13:34.731 --> 13:36.232
Listen to the words.

13:36.274 --> 13:38.859
Good. Boy. Cheerleader.

13:38.901 --> 13:40.487
Quit while you still

13:38.901 --> 13:40.487
have some dignity.

13:40.528 --> 13:42.071
Oh, and let her think

13:40.528 --> 13:42.071
I'm a quitter?

13:42.113 --> 13:44.865
You can't even remember

13:42.113 --> 13:44.865
a simple six-step routine.

13:44.907 --> 13:47.452
There's six steps?

13:47.494 --> 13:51.038
Yes. It's just right, left,

13:47.494 --> 13:51.038
right, left, reverse, pose.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.333
You remember that

13:51.080 --> 13:53.333
from just watching?

13:53.374 --> 13:56.169
You guys did it,

13:53.374 --> 13:56.169
like, ten times.

13:56.210 --> 13:57.128
So...

13:57.170 --> 13:58.588
you know my routine?

13:58.630 --> 14:00.298
It's not that hard.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.882
But... you know

14:00.340 --> 14:01.882
my routine.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.259
Yes, I do.

14:03.301 --> 14:04.885
Look, I know where

14:03.301 --> 14:04.885
this is going, and...

14:04.927 --> 14:05.886
No, you don't.

14:05.928 --> 14:07.388
You're going to help me.

14:07.430 --> 14:08.889
That  is  where

14:07.430 --> 14:08.889
I was going.

14:08.931 --> 14:10.308
Oh. Good.

14:08.931 --> 14:10.308
Let's get started.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.352
No!

14:10.350 --> 14:12.352
Oh, come on, you have to.

14:12.393 --> 14:13.520
No. Don't you know

14:12.393 --> 14:13.520
how embarrassing

14:13.561 --> 14:14.895
that could be for me?

14:14.937 --> 14:17.148
I know what's

14:14.937 --> 14:17.148
more embarrassing.

14:14.937 --> 14:17.148
What?

14:17.190 --> 14:20.901
Getting beaten into a coma

14:17.190 --> 14:20.901
by a good boy cheerleader.

14:20.943 --> 14:24.739
SPANGLER: My mother was neither

14:20.943 --> 14:24.739
a Madonna or a whore!

14:24.781 --> 14:26.907
She was a damn fine woman!

14:26.949 --> 14:28.409
Stick your arms out!

14:28.451 --> 14:29.910
We have to sell this!

14:29.952 --> 14:32.413
Can you move your hand

14:29.952 --> 14:32.413
a little to the left?

14:32.455 --> 14:33.914
REESE:

14:32.455 --> 14:33.914
Spread your legs!

14:33.956 --> 14:35.124
MALCOLM:

14:33.956 --> 14:35.124
No!

14:35.166 --> 14:36.376
REESE:

14:35.166 --> 14:36.376
I said spread your legs!

14:36.417 --> 14:37.502
MALCOLM:

14:36.417 --> 14:37.502
No!

14:37.544 --> 14:38.919
It's time for the talk, Hal.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.547
REESE:

14:38.961 --> 14:40.547
Come on, spread your legs!

14:40.588 --> 14:42.841
MALCOLM:

14:40.588 --> 14:42.841
I'm not spreading my legs!

14:47.345 --> 14:48.638
(chanting): Fight, fight, fight!

14:47.345 --> 14:48.638
Fight harder!

14:48.680 --> 14:50.390
Wildcats, help us out, fight!

14:50.431 --> 14:51.850
Fight, fight, fight!

14:51.891 --> 14:52.933
Fight harder!

14:52.975 --> 14:54.853
Wildcats, help us out, fight!

14:54.894 --> 14:58.022
We got spirit!

14:54.894 --> 14:58.022
Wildcats, we got spirit!

14:58.064 --> 15:00.859
Wildcats, we got what?

14:58.064 --> 15:00.859
What, what, what?

15:00.900 --> 15:02.819
What, what, what,

15:00.900 --> 15:02.819
what, what, what, what?

15:02.861 --> 15:03.944
We got spirit!

15:03.986 --> 15:05.946
Wildcats, we got spirit!

15:05.988 --> 15:08.742
Wildcats, we got what?

15:05.988 --> 15:08.742
What, what, what?

15:08.783 --> 15:10.951
What, what, what,

15:08.783 --> 15:10.951
what, what, what, what?

15:10.993 --> 15:12.871
We got spirit!

15:12.912 --> 15:14.539
(cheering)

15:14.581 --> 15:16.583
Yes. Yes.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.334
(sniffs)

15:18.376 --> 15:20.961
Reese, that was incredible.

15:21.003 --> 15:22.963
Who's been helping you

15:21.003 --> 15:22.963
on your spirit kicks?

15:26.509 --> 15:28.177
(laughing)

15:33.015 --> 15:35.976
(Reese sobbing loudly)

15:36.018 --> 15:39.856
Come on, Reese,

15:36.018 --> 15:39.856
I really have to go!

15:39.898 --> 15:43.443
I'm the most worthless,

15:39.898 --> 15:43.443
putrid loser in the world.

15:43.484 --> 15:44.985
Everybody hates me.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.237
I  hate me.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.655
(sobbing)

15:47.697 --> 15:48.989
Your brother in there?

15:49.031 --> 15:50.991
Where else?

15:51.033 --> 15:53.828
Reese? Come on out.

15:51.033 --> 15:53.828
We need to have a talk.

15:53.870 --> 15:54.995
Finally.

15:55.037 --> 15:57.164
No, Malcolm, you're in

15:55.037 --> 15:57.164
on this talk, too.

15:57.206 --> 15:58.666
Me? Why do I

15:57.206 --> 15:58.666
have to be here?

15:58.708 --> 16:00.794
Relax-- it's going to be

15:58.708 --> 16:00.794
far worse for me

16:00.835 --> 16:03.003
than it is for you.

16:03.045 --> 16:04.297
Boys, this talk

16:04.338 --> 16:05.882
is very important,

16:05.924 --> 16:08.593
so I need

16:05.924 --> 16:08.593
your undivided attention.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.010
It's very important

16:10.052 --> 16:12.054
that you be bored

16:10.052 --> 16:12.054
and squirm a lot.

16:12.096 --> 16:14.265
Now, I want to tell you

16:12.096 --> 16:14.265
about what happens

16:14.307 --> 16:17.017
when a boy really,

16:14.307 --> 16:17.017
really likes a girl.

16:17.059 --> 16:20.647
And, Dewey, I'll try to make

16:17.059 --> 16:20.647
this easy for you to understand.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.022
Ah.

16:23.274 --> 16:26.026
Aw, man, I still

16:23.274 --> 16:26.026
play with that.

16:26.068 --> 16:27.487
Here we go.

16:27.528 --> 16:29.405
You see, there's a certain thing

16:27.528 --> 16:29.405
that happens

16:29.447 --> 16:31.031
between normal, healthy people.

16:31.073 --> 16:33.326
It's called chemistry.

16:33.367 --> 16:34.869
Well, that doesn't happen.

16:34.911 --> 16:36.287
Except maybe the first time.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.747
What  does  happen

16:37.789 --> 16:38.832
is this.

16:38.873 --> 16:40.291
I like you.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.042
(high-pitched voice):

16:40.333 --> 16:42.042
I like you, too.

16:42.084 --> 16:43.670
And if they love each other

16:43.711 --> 16:45.421
and take the proper precautions,

16:43.711 --> 16:45.421
they'll have sex.

16:45.463 --> 16:47.131
But I've told you

16:45.463 --> 16:47.131
about that already.

16:47.173 --> 16:48.048
Not me.

16:48.090 --> 16:50.259
Well, ask your brothers.

16:51.761 --> 16:55.055
Now, unfortunately,

16:51.761 --> 16:55.055
if the boy is from our family,

16:55.097 --> 16:57.934
it goes a little more like this.

16:57.976 --> 16:59.059
I like you.

16:59.101 --> 17:00.561
I hate you!

17:00.603 --> 17:02.856
Now I love you!

17:02.897 --> 17:04.064
Leave me alone!

17:04.106 --> 17:05.984
Your insane neediness

17:04.106 --> 17:05.984
is driving me away!

17:06.025 --> 17:08.068
Look at me! Look at me!

17:08.110 --> 17:09.278
Look, oh, I'm crazy! Look-it!

17:09.320 --> 17:10.864
Ooh! Ooh! Pay attention to me!

17:10.905 --> 17:12.699
Look at me!

17:10.905 --> 17:12.699
Look at me! I'm crazy!

17:12.740 --> 17:14.074
I'm an idiot!

17:14.116 --> 17:15.075
Watch me crash and burn!

17:15.117 --> 17:16.786
(hooting)

17:16.828 --> 17:18.955
There's no explaining it.

17:18.997 --> 17:20.247
It's hereditary.

17:20.289 --> 17:22.082
And it goes back

17:20.289 --> 17:22.082
for generations.

17:22.124 --> 17:24.669
Francis has it,

17:22.124 --> 17:24.669
so does Uncle Pete.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.546
It's why your great

17:24.711 --> 17:26.546
grandpa went to work

17:26.587 --> 17:27.922
on that oil rig in Peru.

17:27.964 --> 17:30.132
All I know is

17:27.964 --> 17:30.132
your mother must carry

17:30.174 --> 17:31.968
some sort of internal antidote,

17:32.010 --> 17:36.055
because, through some fluke,

17:32.010 --> 17:36.055
I was lucky enough to get her.

17:37.598 --> 17:40.018
I just wanted you boys

17:37.598 --> 17:40.018
to know what you were in for.

17:45.189 --> 17:49.027
There was so much I

17:45.189 --> 17:49.027
wanted to tell her...

17:49.068 --> 17:51.111
but she was gone.

17:51.153 --> 17:54.407
And I... I...

17:54.448 --> 17:55.783
Come on, sir.

17:55.825 --> 17:57.117
Just say it.

17:57.159 --> 17:59.704
I hated her!

17:59.746 --> 18:01.956
(sobbing)

18:06.002 --> 18:08.212
(sniffles)

18:08.254 --> 18:11.131
All these issues with my mother.

18:11.173 --> 18:14.802
I know now that this

18:11.173 --> 18:14.802
was not an accident.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.973
You know, talking with you

18:16.596 --> 18:18.973
has helped me

18:19.015 --> 18:21.434
work out some things

18:19.015 --> 18:21.434
with my own family.

18:22.810 --> 18:24.437
I mean, all those years

18:22.810 --> 18:24.437
I blamed my parents

18:24.478 --> 18:28.148
for every senseless act

18:24.478 --> 18:28.148
of self-destruction.

18:28.190 --> 18:31.193
And all this time, I was

18:28.190 --> 18:31.193
at least partially responsible

18:31.235 --> 18:33.112
for a couple of them.

18:34.196 --> 18:36.240
(school bell ringing)

18:49.670 --> 18:51.422
You know, it really

18:49.670 --> 18:51.422
means a lot to me

18:51.464 --> 18:54.174
to know that I can come to you

18:51.464 --> 18:54.174
when I need to talk.

18:54.216 --> 18:56.469
Familiarity

18:54.216 --> 18:56.469
breeds contempt, Cadet.

19:08.188 --> 19:09.189
What are you doing?

19:09.231 --> 19:10.357
What's the point?

19:10.399 --> 19:12.568
You heard Dad. I'm doomed!

19:12.610 --> 19:15.237
You can't quit! I've worked

19:12.610 --> 19:15.237
too hard for you to quit now!

19:15.279 --> 19:16.823
I hate to inform you, brain boy,

19:16.864 --> 19:18.658
it's not about you,

19:16.864 --> 19:18.658
it's about me.

19:18.699 --> 19:20.576
That's before I spent

19:18.699 --> 19:20.576
an entire day

19:20.618 --> 19:22.078
with your hand on my ass!

19:22.120 --> 19:23.203
You owe me!

19:23.245 --> 19:24.204
I can't help you.

19:24.246 --> 19:25.665
Yes, you can!

19:25.706 --> 19:28.208
You can break the cycle

19:25.706 --> 19:28.208
Dad was talking about!

19:28.250 --> 19:29.919
You have to talk to Wendy!

19:29.961 --> 19:31.587
I can't! I freeze up!

19:31.629 --> 19:34.715
Do you want to end up

19:31.629 --> 19:34.715
like Francis? Or Uncle Pete?

19:34.757 --> 19:35.925
I don't care anymore!

19:35.967 --> 19:37.426
Anything's better than this!

19:37.468 --> 19:40.346
Even marrying Mom?

19:43.265 --> 19:47.227
Dewey, your mother and I

19:43.265 --> 19:47.227
want to talk to you.

19:47.269 --> 19:49.105
You're a good boy.

19:49.147 --> 19:50.272
But in life,

19:50.314 --> 19:51.273
being good doesn't always

19:51.315 --> 19:53.067
get you the things you want.

19:54.276 --> 19:55.736
I guess what I'm trying

19:54.276 --> 19:55.736
to say is

19:55.778 --> 19:58.156
that when your mother and I

19:55.778 --> 19:58.156
don't buy you a toy,

19:58.197 --> 20:00.074
it doesn't mean

19:58.197 --> 20:00.074
that we don't love you.

20:00.116 --> 20:01.325
Hmm?

20:01.367 --> 20:03.327
You just have to learn

20:01.367 --> 20:03.327
that disappointment

20:03.369 --> 20:05.245
is all part of being a grown-up.

20:05.287 --> 20:08.708
But, luckily,

20:05.287 --> 20:08.708
you're not a grown-up yet!

20:08.749 --> 20:09.876
Ta-da!

20:09.917 --> 20:11.544
Wow!

20:11.585 --> 20:13.838
(both laugh)

20:13.880 --> 20:16.549
Oh, come on,

20:13.880 --> 20:16.549
how cute is that?

20:18.092 --> 20:19.426
Break me.

20:19.468 --> 20:20.594
Okay.

20:21.345 --> 20:23.181
(chuckles)

20:23.222 --> 20:25.933
Okay, second row.

20:27.601 --> 20:29.896
Okay, ready?

20:27.601 --> 20:29.896
Here we go.

20:31.772 --> 20:34.274
I... I...

20:34.316 --> 20:36.652
Did you say something?

20:36.694 --> 20:38.988
Wendy, I really like you.

20:39.030 --> 20:41.365
Like when a boy likes a girl--

20:39.030 --> 20:41.365
normal and healthy.

20:41.407 --> 20:43.910
I'm sorry for hurting

20:41.407 --> 20:43.910
you all those times.

20:43.951 --> 20:45.327
I'm really

20:43.951 --> 20:45.327
not a bad guy.

20:45.369 --> 20:49.248
Anyways... thanks.

20:52.210 --> 20:54.170
I like you, too.

20:56.047 --> 20:57.548
Really?

20:57.590 --> 20:58.966
Yeah.

20:59.008 --> 21:01.594
I even kind of liked

20:59.008 --> 21:01.594
your bad boy side, too.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.978
(all screaming)

21:11.020 --> 21:12.688
(gasping)

21:12.730 --> 21:14.607
Oh, my God!

21:14.648 --> 21:16.901
Call...

21:16.943 --> 21:19.486
nine...

21:19.528 --> 21:22.240
one...

21:22.281 --> 21:24.283
(clamoring)

21:28.996 --> 21:31.331
Hello, Mother?

21:31.373 --> 21:33.500
It's Edwin.

21:33.542 --> 21:36.545
Yes, it has been a long time.

21:36.587 --> 21:38.005
So be sure to try

21:38.047 --> 21:40.216
the new and improved

21:38.047 --> 21:40.216
Chip-A-Roo cookie today.

21:40.258 --> 21:43.761
I can make you taller,

21:40.258 --> 21:43.761
I can make you better-looking.

21:43.803 --> 21:47.014
If you eat enough of me,

21:43.803 --> 21:47.014
I can make you president,

21:47.848 --> 21:49.642
maybe even emperor of the world.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.352
Honey, can you buy me

21:50.977 --> 21:52.352
a box of these cookies?

21:52.979 --> 21:54.063
Make it two.

21:54.605 --> 21:55.648
Make it two boxes.
