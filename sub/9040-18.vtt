00:07.467 --> 00:08.800
- HEY, CAN YOU
GET THAT, MAN?

00:08.800 --> 00:11.667
- IT'S YOUR HOUSE.

00:11.667 --> 00:14.600
- MY PRETZELS.

00:16.267 --> 00:18.067
- SOMEDAY I'LL HAVE
A SATELLITE DISH,

00:18.067 --> 00:21.200
AND YOU WON'T SEE ME
NO MORE.

00:24.067 --> 00:25.767
- HELLO. RAYMOND?

00:25.767 --> 00:29.400
- EVEN BETTER.

00:29.400 --> 00:33.167
I'M ROBERT, THE BROTHER.

00:33.167 --> 00:34.700
- WELL, HI,
I'M CAROL MARSHALL

00:34.700 --> 00:37.067
FROM HUMM VAC CLEANING
SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL.

00:37.067 --> 00:39.600
- OH, PLEASE, COME IN.
- OH, THANK YOU.

00:39.600 --> 00:41.600
AH, YOU MUST BE RAYMOND.
- YEAH. HI.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.500
- HI. I SPOKE
TO YOUR WIFE LAST NIGHT

00:43.500 --> 00:45.300
ABOUT COMING BY
TO DEMONSTRATE OUR SYSTEM.

00:45.300 --> 00:47.000
- OH, RIGHT.
YEAH, OH, THE VACUUM.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.433
YEAH, BUT I THOUGHT SHE SAID

00:48.433 --> 00:49.667
THAT WE DIDN'T NEED
A NEW VACUUM CLEANER.

00:49.667 --> 00:51.667
YEAH, SHE DID.
I REMEMBER BECAUSE

00:51.667 --> 00:53.200
IT WAS RIGHT BEFORE
SHE TOLD ME THAT I HAVE

00:53.200 --> 00:55.933
TO GO PICK UP
SOMETHING FROM SOMEWHERE.

00:55.933 --> 00:57.400
OH, YOU DIDN'T HAPPEN

00:57.400 --> 00:59.800
TO CATCH ANY OF THAT,
DID YOU?

00:59.800 --> 01:01.267
- SORRY.

01:01.267 --> 01:03.100
YEAH, SO WHEN WE
SPOKE LAST NIGHT,

01:03.100 --> 01:04.600
THINGS DID SEEM
PRETTY HECTIC,

01:04.600 --> 01:06.400
SO SINCE I HAPPEN
TO BE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

01:06.400 --> 01:08.467
I WONDERED IF MAYBE NOW
MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME

01:08.467 --> 01:10.400
TO COME SHOW YOU HOW WONDERFUL
THE HUMM VAC IS,

01:10.400 --> 01:12.800
AND TO OFFER YOU THIS
COMPLIMENTARY LINT BRUSH.

01:12.800 --> 01:14.800
- YEAH. I DON'T KNOW.

01:14.800 --> 01:16.267
MY WIFE SAYS I'M
REALLY NOT SUPPOSED TO--

01:16.267 --> 01:20.933
- COME ON, RAY.
IT'S COMPLIMENTARY.

01:20.933 --> 01:22.767
- MAY I, ROBERT?

01:22.767 --> 01:25.100
THIS WON'T HURT A BIT.

01:27.500 --> 01:28.700
SEE?

01:28.700 --> 01:30.000
- EW. COOL.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.933
- AND THAT IS YOURS FOR BEING
SUCH A GOOD PATIENT.

01:31.933 --> 01:33.100
- THANK YOU.

01:33.100 --> 01:35.867
YOU WERE VERY GENTLE.
- OH.

01:35.867 --> 01:37.067
OH, HERE, I HAVE
ONE FOR YOU TOO.

01:37.067 --> 01:40.900
- OH. OH.

01:40.900 --> 01:42.433
THANK YOU.

01:42.433 --> 01:44.433
LISTEN, IT'S TOO BAD
THAT MY WIFE ISN'T HERE,

01:44.433 --> 01:45.767
'CAUSE SHE'S REALLY
THE VACUUMER.

01:45.767 --> 01:47.633
- OH. WELL, ALL I KNOW

01:47.633 --> 01:49.433
IS IF I WERE MARRIED
AND MY HUSBAND

01:49.433 --> 01:52.500
MISSED OUT ON A CHANCE TO MAKE
MY LIFE 50 TO 75% EASIER,

01:52.500 --> 01:56.167
WELL, I MIGHT BE
A LITTLE ANNOYED.

01:56.167 --> 01:59.300
- SO THERE'S NO

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:27.433 --> 02:28.833
YOU SCARED THE HELL
OUT OF ME.

02:28.833 --> 02:30.367

- WHAT, YOU BOUGHT THIS?

02:38.667 --> 02:39.833
- YUP.

02:39.833 --> 02:42.633
- YOU HEARD ME TELL
THE LADY ON THE PHONE

02:42.633 --> 02:45.600
THAT WE DO NOT NEED
A VACUUM CLEANER.

02:45.600 --> 02:46.833
- I KNOW, I KNOW,
BUT IT TURNS OUT,

02:46.833 --> 02:48.067
WE REALLY DO.

02:48.067 --> 02:51.267
SHE SHOWED ME
ALL THE DIRT.

02:51.267 --> 02:53.600
- YOU LET HER IN HERE?

02:53.600 --> 02:55.100
WAIT. WAIT A MINUTE.

02:55.100 --> 02:57.500
HOW GOOD-LOOKING
WAS THIS SALESLADY?

03:00.100 --> 03:03.667
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
SHE WAS QUITE GOOD-LOOKING,

03:03.667 --> 03:05.267
BUT I'M NOT AFRAID
TO SAY THAT,

03:05.267 --> 03:06.567
'CAUSE THAT'S HOW GOOD
THIS MACHINE IS.

03:06.567 --> 03:10.067
I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT THIS
FROM AN UGLY MAN!

03:10.067 --> 03:11.500
- YOU ARE
SUCH A SUCKER.

03:11.500 --> 03:14.633
- A SUCKER
FOR A GREAT PRODUCT.

THAT'S A FULLY INSULATED
4-HORSEPOWER MOTOR.

03:40.633 --> 03:43.000
TO THE NAKED EYE.

03:44.333 --> 03:45.600
IN A REGULAR VACUUM,

03:45.600 --> 03:47.067
THERE'S NOT
ENOUGH SUCTION POWER

03:47.067 --> 03:49.100
TO PICK UP ALL THE DIRT

03:49.100 --> 03:50.933
THAT THE BEATER BAR
KICKS UP.

I VACUUMED THERE YESTERDAY.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.467
- YOU COULD'VE VACUUMED HERE
FOUR OF FIVE TIMES

03:55.467 --> 03:56.800
YESTERDAY
WITH YOUR OLD VACUUM.

03:56.800 --> 03:58.467
- RAY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
TO MY PILLOW?

03:58.467 --> 04:01.667
- PATIENCE, MY DEAR.
LOOK.

04:10.667 --> 04:13.067
THE HUMM VAC,
IT HAS UP TO 50 TIMES

04:13.067 --> 04:15.133
MORE SUCTION POWER.

THE "WOW FACTOR."

RIGHT INTO THE SYSTEM.

RIGHT DOWN THE DRAIN.

HOW TO DO THE DRAPES.

05:09.667 --> 05:10.800
- NO, NO, SILLY.

05:10.800 --> 05:12.767
THE HUMM VAC'S GONNA
DO THE DRAPES.

THE CREDIT.

- HI, MARIE.

05:59.567 --> 06:02.133
- HI. I WAS
PASSING BY MY WINDOW,

06:02.133 --> 06:06.467
AND I COULDN'T HELP
SEEING INTO YOUR WINDOW.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.733
AND I NOTICE
YOU BOUGHT A NEW VACUUM.

06:08.733 --> 06:10.867
- IT'S AMAZING WHAT THIS THING
PICKS UP, MARIE,

06:10.867 --> 06:14.567
AND NO BAGS!
- NO BAGS!

06:14.567 --> 06:16.867
- I AM SO GLAD
THIS WORKED OUT.

06:16.867 --> 06:18.333
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

06:18.333 --> 06:19.833
- WELL, WHEN THE SALESLADY
CALLED ME AND TOLD ME

06:19.833 --> 06:21.800
SHE HAD THE GREATEST
CLEANING INNOVATION

06:21.800 --> 06:25.133
SINCE THE BROOM, I IMMEDIATELY
THOUGHT OF YOU.

06:33.167 --> 06:34.667
- YOU SENT HER OVER HERE?

06:34.667 --> 06:37.267
- OF COURSE.

06:41.133 --> 06:43.767
- I DID NOT KNOW THAT.

06:43.767 --> 06:45.300
- WELL, YOU TWO ENJOY.

06:45.300 --> 06:48.433
I WOULD NEVER WANT
TO INTERFERE WITH HOUSEWORK.

06:52.767 --> 06:54.400
- NOW MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME
TO TELL YOU

06:54.400 --> 06:57.500
ABOUT THE FREE
EUCALYPTUS ROOM FRESHENER.

07:05.200 --> 07:08.567

07:16.100 --> 07:17.400
- HI, MARIE.
- HELLO, DEAR.

07:17.400 --> 07:18.967
- AM I INTERRUPTING
ANYTHING?

07:18.967 --> 07:22.567
- OH, NO. I'M JUST LETTING
FRANK'S PANTS OUT AGAIN.

07:25.133 --> 07:28.267
IT'S IN GOD'S HANDS NOW.

07:33.900 --> 07:38.367
- UM, YOU KNOW, MARIE,
SOMETHING WAS BOTHERING ME,

07:38.367 --> 07:41.233
AND I JUST WANTED
TO ASK YOU ABOUT IT.

07:41.233 --> 07:42.600
- OF COURSE, DEAR.

07:42.600 --> 07:44.133
WHAT IS IT?

07:44.133 --> 07:45.500
- [clears throat]

07:45.500 --> 07:47.533
WELL, UM,

07:47.533 --> 07:49.767
YOU KNOW THIS AFTERNOON
WHEN YOU SAID

07:49.767 --> 07:52.133
THAT THE SALESLADY
TOLD YOU THAT SHE HAD

07:52.133 --> 07:54.933
THIS GREAT NEW
CLEANING DEVICE,

07:54.933 --> 07:58.200
YOU IMMEDIATELY
THOUGHT OF ME.

07:58.200 --> 08:01.167
WHY WAS THAT?

08:01.167 --> 08:03.300
- [laughs]

08:05.533 --> 08:08.300
- NO, REALLY, MARIE,
WHY?

08:08.300 --> 08:12.567
- IS THIS
A TRICK QUESTION?

08:12.567 --> 08:13.767
- UH, NO.

08:13.767 --> 08:15.667
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE
YOU'RE ALWAYS IMPLYING

08:15.667 --> 08:17.600
THAT I DON'T
KEEP A CLEAN HOUSE.

08:17.600 --> 08:19.767
- WELL, NOW YOU HAVE
A LITTLE HELP.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.567
[laughs]

08:21.567 --> 08:23.933
- BUT YOU DIDN'T
FEEL THE NEED

08:23.933 --> 08:25.133
TO BUY A HUMM VAC?

08:25.133 --> 08:28.100
- WELL, THAT MACHINE
IS FOR PEOPLE--

08:28.100 --> 08:31.333
IT'S LIKE,
IF YOU HAVE A BAD LEG,

08:31.333 --> 08:34.467
THEN YOU NEED CRUTCHES.

08:40.233 --> 08:43.367
- AND YOUR LEGS ARE FINE?

08:45.733 --> 08:47.300
SO THERE'S NO DIRT
IN THIS HOUSE?

08:47.300 --> 08:50.200
- NOT SINCE
I'VE LIVED HERE.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.933
- REALLY?
- MM-HMM.

08:52.933 --> 08:56.067
- THANK YOU.
- OKAY.

09:10.133 --> 09:13.100
OH, YOU BROUGHT
YOUR NEW VACUUM HERE.

09:13.100 --> 09:16.500
DO YOU NEED ME
TO SHOW YOU HOW TO USE IT?

09:16.500 --> 09:18.100
- NO. NOPE.

09:18.100 --> 09:19.333
I KNOW HOW TO USE IT.

09:19.333 --> 09:20.633
I JUST WANT
TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

09:20.633 --> 09:22.667
- YOU'RE GOING TO VACUUM
MY HOUSE?

09:22.667 --> 09:24.467
- YOU KNOW,
MY HOUSE MIGHT APPEAR

09:24.467 --> 09:26.400
TO BE A BIT
MORE CLUTTERED THAN YOURS,

09:26.400 --> 09:27.800
AND, YEAH, ALL RIGHT,

09:27.800 --> 09:29.633
THERE'S THE OCCASIONAL
CRUMB, DIRTY DISH.

09:29.633 --> 09:31.100
I'M NOT SAYING
THAT THERE'S NO DIRT.

09:31.100 --> 09:33.900
YEAH, THERE IS,
BUT THAT'S EVERY HOUSE.

09:33.900 --> 09:35.800
EVERY HOUSE
HAS DIRT, MARIE,

09:35.800 --> 09:37.367
EVEN THIS ONE.

09:37.367 --> 09:39.267
[vacuum cleaner whirring]

09:39.267 --> 09:42.333
- WELL, I MUST SAY,

09:42.333 --> 09:44.133
I THINK THAT MAYBE
YOU'RE GOING A LITTLE BIT--

09:44.133 --> 09:45.533
- EXCUSE ME, MARIE.
- OKAY, OKAY.

09:45.533 --> 09:50.067
- THIS IS WHAT WE CALL
A HIGH-TRAFFIC AREA.

09:50.067 --> 09:53.233
- YOU'RE GOING
AGAINST THE NAP.

09:53.233 --> 09:56.367
DID ANYONE EVER
TEACH YOU ABOUT NAP?

10:00.433 --> 10:01.767
- OKAY.

10:01.767 --> 10:04.533
NOW, LET'S TAKE A LOOK

10:04.533 --> 10:06.967
AT WHAT WE LIKE
TO REFER TO

10:06.967 --> 10:10.100
AS THE "WOW" FACTOR.

10:11.633 --> 10:16.667
- THAT WATER
LOOKS VERY CLEAN.

10:16.667 --> 10:19.600
WOW!
[laughs]

10:24.900 --> 10:28.467
- WELL, LET--
LET ME JUST, UH,

10:28.467 --> 10:31.833
LET ME JUST TRY
UNDER THE COUCH, OKAY?

10:31.833 --> 10:32.967
THERE WE GO.

10:32.967 --> 10:35.767
[vacuum cleaner whirring]

10:35.767 --> 10:40.100
'CAUSE IT CAN GET
PRETTY NASTY UNDER HERE.

10:46.700 --> 10:48.467
OKAY.

10:52.467 --> 10:54.400
DAMN IT.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.900
- IS IT ME,
OR DOES THAT WATER

11:00.900 --> 11:04.400
LOOK EVEN CLEANER?

11:04.400 --> 11:06.167
- WELL, I'M STILL

11:06.167 --> 11:08.700
KIND OF GETTING THE HANG
OF THIS, SO--

11:08.700 --> 11:10.167
- YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND,
DEAR,

11:10.167 --> 11:12.600
THAT VACUUMS
DON'T CLEAN HOUSES.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.533
PEOPLE CLEAN HOUSES.

11:16.700 --> 11:18.267
- YOU KNOW, MAYBE I JUST
DIDN'T HAVE THIS

11:18.267 --> 11:20.533
PUSHED ALL THE WAY IN.
THAT'S IT.

11:20.533 --> 11:23.400
- WELL, YOU'RE WELCOME
TO KEEP GOING.

11:23.400 --> 11:26.067
IT'S PROBABLY GOOD PRACTICE.

11:26.067 --> 11:28.100
- WHERE ARE MY PANTS, MARIE?

11:28.100 --> 11:31.167
I'M FREEZING HERE!
- OH! COMING, FRANK!

11:31.167 --> 11:34.200
OH, YOU'VE WORKED UP
QUITE A SWEAT.

11:34.200 --> 11:35.767
WHEN I COME BACK,
I'LL BRING YOU

11:35.767 --> 11:38.700
SOMETHING COOL TO DRINK.

11:44.767 --> 11:46.500
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- GIVE ME YOUR SHOES!

11:46.500 --> 11:47.800
- WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:47.800 --> 11:49.367
- YOU AND THE KIDS
WERE IN THE SANDBOX

11:49.367 --> 11:50.767
THIS MORNING, WEREN'T YOU?
- YEAH. WHY?

11:50.767 --> 11:53.433
OH, NO, DID PARKER'S CAT
GET IN THERE?

11:53.433 --> 11:55.233
- COME ON!

11:55.233 --> 11:57.067
I NEED SOME DIRT!

11:57.067 --> 11:58.167
I'M GONNA SHUT
YOUR MOTHER UP,

11:58.167 --> 11:59.567
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

11:59.567 --> 12:01.300
- YOU GONNA FILL
HER MOUTH WITH DIRT?

12:01.300 --> 12:03.600
- NO, ON THE RUG.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.867
SHE'S GONNA SEE SHE NEEDS
THIS VACUUM LIKE ANYBODY ELSE.

12:05.867 --> 12:09.467
- COME--OW!
UNTIE IT FIRST!

12:09.467 --> 12:11.667
- OH, COME ON,
GIVE ME THE OTHER ONE.

12:11.667 --> 12:13.800
- OH, NO.

12:13.800 --> 12:17.133
- DAMN IT, THE ONE DAY
THAT YOU'RE NOT A PIG!

12:18.900 --> 12:21.467
- I THINK YOU'RE GETTING
A LITTLE NUTS HERE.

12:21.467 --> 12:24.600
- OH, IT'S PLASTIC.
IT'S PLASTIC!

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
EVEN HER DIRT'S
NOT DIRT!

12:28.000 --> 12:29.467
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS?

12:29.467 --> 12:30.867
IT'S THIS
STUPID VACUUM CLEANER.

12:30.867 --> 12:32.300
I TOLD YOU
NOT TO BUY IT!

12:32.300 --> 12:34.967
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!
DON'T! STOP IT!

12:34.967 --> 12:39.633
- HEY, WHAT'S WITH
ALL THE YELLING?

12:39.633 --> 12:42.367
- I DON'T THINK DEBRA
COULD FIND ANY DIRT.

12:42.367 --> 12:44.433
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
THERE'S NO DIRT HERE.

12:44.433 --> 12:46.267
YOU WIN,
BUT I AM SICK OF YOU

12:46.267 --> 12:47.700
MAKING ME FEEL LIKE
A BAD PERSON BECAUSE

12:47.700 --> 12:49.667
I DON'T KEEP MY HOUSE
EXACTLY THE WAY YOU DO.

12:49.667 --> 12:51.333
A CLEAN HOUSE IS NOT
THE MOST IMPORTANT

12:51.333 --> 12:53.500
THING IN THE WORLD.

12:53.500 --> 12:54.900
- YOU KNOW
WHO SAYS THAT?

12:54.900 --> 12:57.633
A MESSY PERSON.

12:58.800 --> 13:00.200
- ALL RIGHT,

13:00.200 --> 13:02.233
AS HARD AS THIS IS
FOR YOU TO BELIEVE, MARIE,

13:02.233 --> 13:03.900
I DO LIKE
TO KEEP A NEAT HOUSE.

13:03.900 --> 13:06.933
I'M JUST NOT GOING TO SPEND
EVERY SPARE MINUTE CLEANING IT.

13:06.933 --> 13:08.300
- THERE ARE NO SPARE MINUTES.

13:08.300 --> 13:09.333
YOU HAVE A FAMILY
TO CARE FOR.

13:09.333 --> 13:10.567
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.

13:10.567 --> 13:12.967
- YES, I DO.
I CARE FOR MY FAMILY.

13:12.967 --> 13:14.800
I SPEND MY TIME
ENJOYING THEM,

13:14.800 --> 13:16.733
NOT STERILIZING THEM!

13:19.300 --> 13:21.667
- ARE YOU SAYING
I DON'T LOVE MY FAMILY?

13:21.667 --> 13:23.233
- NO, THAT'S NOT--
- BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING

13:23.233 --> 13:26.067
IN THE WORLD THAT I LOVE MORE
THAN MY FAMILY.

13:26.067 --> 13:27.467
- OW!

13:27.467 --> 13:29.433
- EASY.

13:31.867 --> 13:34.600
- NO, IT'S JUST THAT THIS HOUSE
IS SO CLEAN

13:34.600 --> 13:38.433
AND SO ARRANGED,
IT'S NOT EXACTLY

13:38.433 --> 13:40.267
THE WARMEST PLACE
IN THE WORLD.

13:40.267 --> 13:41.700
- HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT?

13:41.700 --> 13:45.200
- WELL, I MEAN, COME ON--
PLASTIC SLIPCOVERS.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.733
- THAT'S TO PROTECT
THE UPHOLSTERY.

13:46.733 --> 13:48.567
- OH, ALL RIGHT, SO IT
PROTECTS THE UPHOLSTERY,

13:48.567 --> 13:50.567
BUT HOW DO YOU THINK
IT MAKES PEOPLE FEEL?

13:50.567 --> 13:53.333
- HOT AND STICKY,

13:53.333 --> 13:55.067
ESPECIALLY IN THE SUMMER

13:55.067 --> 13:57.200
WHEN I'M
IN MY ALTOGETHER.

13:59.767 --> 14:02.900
- I SAY THANK THE LORD
FOR THE SLIPCOVERS.

14:02.900 --> 14:04.600
- OH, COME ON, RAY.

14:04.600 --> 14:07.367
YOU MAKE JOKES ABOUT THOSE
SLIPCOVERS ALL THE TIME.

14:07.367 --> 14:09.267
- YOU JOKE
ABOUT MY SLIPCOVERS?

14:09.267 --> 14:11.167
- NO WAY.
NO, THAT'S NOT MY STYLE.

14:11.167 --> 14:13.300
- WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY
ABOUT THE PLASTIC

14:13.300 --> 14:16.433
AND THE POWDER ROOM
AND THE GUEST TOWELS?

14:18.333 --> 14:20.467
- TELL ME, RAYMOND.

14:23.867 --> 14:27.333
- JUST THAT, YOU KNOW,
IT'S LIKE THERE'S--

14:27.333 --> 14:29.267
THERE'S CHINA
THAT WE NEVER USE,

14:29.267 --> 14:32.133
AND THERE'S TOWELS
THAT WE NEVER TOUCH.

14:32.133 --> 14:33.667
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE
SAVING EVERYTHING

14:33.667 --> 14:37.067
FOR A SPECIAL OCCASION
THAT HASN'T HAPPENED YET.

14:37.067 --> 14:39.267
[laughs]

14:39.267 --> 14:40.333
IT'S NOT EVEN A JOKE.
IT'S MORE LIKE

14:40.333 --> 14:43.500
A HUMOROUS OBSERVATION.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.567
- [chuckles]
HE'S RIGHT.

14:45.567 --> 14:48.500
WHAT ARE THOSE LITTLE TOWELS
WITH THE GOLD FRINGE FOR?

14:48.500 --> 14:50.300
FOR WHEN THE POPE
COMES OVER HERE

14:50.300 --> 14:53.033
TO USE THE DOWNSTAIRS CAN?

14:53.033 --> 14:54.433
- BE QUIET.

14:54.433 --> 14:57.300
- I'M USING 'EM.
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

14:57.300 --> 14:58.733
ARE YOU HAPPY NOW,
RAYMOND?

14:58.733 --> 15:00.567
- OH, COME ON, MA.
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.100
- I'M JUST TRYING
TO GIVE MY FAMILY

15:02.100 --> 15:04.067
THE NICEST AND CLEANEST
HOME I CAN.

15:04.067 --> 15:05.267
- AND YOU DO.

15:05.267 --> 15:06.733
- LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
RAYMOND.

15:06.733 --> 15:07.933
WHEN YOU BOYS WERE LITTLE,

15:07.933 --> 15:09.567
YOU WERE ALWAYS
OUTSIDE IN THE DIRT,

15:09.567 --> 15:10.867
AND THEN YOU'D
TROMP THROUGH HERE

15:10.867 --> 15:12.267
LIKE IT WAS A BUS STATION,

15:12.267 --> 15:14.567
AND ROBERT
WITH HIS GIGANTIC FEET,

15:14.567 --> 15:17.033
IT WAS LIKE HAVING
A HORSE IN THE HOUSE.

15:17.033 --> 15:18.600
[laughter]

15:18.600 --> 15:21.267
NO, NO. IT WAS
NOT FUNNY, NO.

15:21.267 --> 15:23.800
IT WAS ALL I COULD DO
TO TAKE CARE OF THIS PLACE.

15:23.800 --> 15:25.033
- HI.

15:25.033 --> 15:27.167
- TAKE OFF YOUR SHOES.
- HUH?

15:27.167 --> 15:28.300
- TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF.

15:28.300 --> 15:31.933
YOU'RE NOT IN A BARN.

15:31.933 --> 15:35.267
- DO WHAT SHE SAYS.
WE'LL GIVE YOU A CARROT.

15:37.833 --> 15:40.467
- WELL, WHAT'S GOING ON?
- OKAY, YOU SEE, MARIE?

15:40.467 --> 15:41.967
THIS IS WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

15:41.967 --> 15:43.467
YOU'RE SO OBSESSED
WITH THE HOUSE BEING CLEAN,

15:43.467 --> 15:46.600
LOOK WHAT YOU'RE DOING
TO YOUR SON.

15:49.400 --> 15:52.000
- ALL RIGHT.
FINE, FINE.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.367
PUT YOUR SHOES BACK ON AND

15:53.367 --> 15:55.333
GALLOP AROUND HERE
ALL YOU WANT.

15:55.333 --> 15:58.333
- WHAT?
- PUT THEM BACK ON!

15:58.333 --> 16:00.600
- YEAH, AND CHECK
THE EXPIRATION DATE

16:00.600 --> 16:02.533
ON YOUR FEET.

16:06.700 --> 16:07.667
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:07.667 --> 16:09.700
- EVERYONE WANTS ME
TO CHANGE?

16:09.700 --> 16:11.400
I CAN CHANGE.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.167
I'M TAKING THE COVERS OFF.

16:13.167 --> 16:17.100
- BUT WHERE ARE WE
GOING TO SIT?

16:17.100 --> 16:18.633
- YOU CAN SIT RIGHT HERE
ON THE COUCH,

16:18.633 --> 16:20.867
BECAUSE I DON'T CARE
ABOUT THESE THINGS ANYMORE.

16:20.867 --> 16:25.033
I'M NOTHING
IF I'M NOT FLEXIBLE.

16:25.033 --> 16:27.167
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
MARIE?

16:27.167 --> 16:30.467
WE CAN SIT ON THE COUCH?

16:30.467 --> 16:33.700
- BE MY GUEST, FRANK.
GO AHEAD.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.033
- SO WE CAN REALLY
SIT THERE,

16:43.033 --> 16:46.033
ON THE ACTUAL COUCH?

16:46.033 --> 16:49.167
- GO AHEAD. ENJOY.

16:49.167 --> 16:51.567
- YOU FIRST.
- NO.

16:51.567 --> 16:54.533
- WOULD YOU SIT?
IT'S A COUCH!

17:29.067 --> 17:30.200
- YOU SEE, DEBRA?

17:30.200 --> 17:32.167
I CAN CHANGE.
I CAN LET GO.

17:32.167 --> 17:34.267
IT'S NICE FABRIC,
ISN'T IT?

17:34.267 --> 17:37.167
- IT'S VERY NICE.

17:37.167 --> 17:40.300
- I FEEL
A LITTLE NAUGHTY.

17:45.933 --> 17:48.433
- CAN'T WAIT TILL SUMMER.

17:54.367 --> 17:56.333
- HEY, HEY,
WHAT ABOUT YOU, MARIE?

17:56.333 --> 17:57.700
YOU'VE SPENT
ALL THESE YEARS

17:57.700 --> 17:59.067
KNOCKING YOURSELF OUT
CLEANING.

17:59.067 --> 18:00.533
YOU SHOULD ENJOY THIS.

18:00.533 --> 18:03.300
- THAT'S RIGHT.

18:03.300 --> 18:06.500
THANK YOU, DEBRA.

18:09.067 --> 18:12.300
EXCUSE ME.

18:17.133 --> 18:20.133
THIS IS NICE.

19:29.100 --> 19:31.333
- [yelling]
DAD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:31.333 --> 19:32.867
- LOOK WHAT YOU DID!
ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?

19:32.867 --> 19:37.600
- YOU'RE MAKING ME NERVOUS,
GIVING ME THE SKUNK EYE!

19:37.600 --> 19:39.667
- WE'RE PUTTING
THE PLASTIC BACK ON.

19:39.667 --> 19:41.900
- NO, NO!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:41.900 --> 19:43.200
- LOOK,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.500
- YOU CAN PUT THE COVER
BACK IF YOU WANT.

19:45.500 --> 19:47.733
YOU KNOW, DO WHATEVER
MAKES YOU HAPPY.

19:47.733 --> 19:49.667
MY FAMILY COMES FIRST.

19:49.667 --> 19:51.700
YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE
THOSE CUSHIONS OUTSIDE

19:51.700 --> 19:53.467
AND SHAKE THEM OUT FIRST.

19:53.467 --> 19:56.033
COME ON,
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW.

19:56.033 --> 19:57.800
- COME ON.

19:57.800 --> 19:59.200
WE'LL SHAKE THEM OUT.

19:59.200 --> 20:00.400
CAN YOU DO THE CHIPS, DEBRA?

20:00.400 --> 20:01.933
CAN YOU PICK THEM UP, PLEASE?

20:01.933 --> 20:04.867
- [sighs]
YEAH. NO PROBLEM.

20:04.867 --> 20:08.000
JEEZ.

20:28.267 --> 20:30.400
[vacuum cleaner whirring]

20:32.467 --> 20:35.067
- HEY, TAKE A BREAK,
ALREADY.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.400
- OH, MAN,
ISN'T THIS THING GREAT?

20:36.400 --> 20:40.367
I WISH THEY MADE
ONE OF THESE YOU COULD RIDE.

20:40.367 --> 20:41.800
- HERE, I MADE YOU
A MEAT LOAF SANDWICH.

20:41.800 --> 20:44.467
- OH, THANKS.

20:46.433 --> 20:49.400
- MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES TODAY
WITH BRISK EASTERLY WINDS.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.567
EXPECT A HIGH NEAR 52 DEGREES,

20:51.567 --> 20:54.200
CLEAR TONIGHT,
WITH A LOW NEAR 41.

20:54.200 --> 20:57.033
TOMORROW--

21:34.367 --> 21:36.300
AAH!

21:38.567 --> 21:41.733
YOU SEE, OUR OLD VACUUM
COULDN'T DO THIS.
