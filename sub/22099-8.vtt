You cannot play God then wash your
hands of the things that you've created.

00:33.325 --> 00:36.703
Sooner or later,
the day comes

00:36.787 --> 00:39.789
when you can't hide from the
things that you've done anymore.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.635
I'll be right there.

00:52.845 --> 00:55.304
How? Why?

00:55.389 --> 00:57.223
It doesn't really matter now.

00:57.307 --> 01:00.852
What does matter is that,
as of this moment,

01:00.936 --> 01:02.186
we are at war.

01:03.272 --> 01:06.232
ADAMA:
You're full of bile, hatred,

01:06.316 --> 01:07.817
poison.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.403
And I'm sorry for what
happened to you down there,

01:10.487 --> 01:12.447
but I gotta run a ship.

01:12.531 --> 01:14.240
The last thing I need

01:14.324 --> 01:18.244
is a one-eyed drunk sowing
discontent and disobedience.

01:18.328 --> 01:21.831
So you can get your ass back
into your quarters and not leave

01:21.915 --> 01:25.418
until you're ready to act like the man
that I've known for the past 30 years.

01:25.502 --> 01:28.254
That man doesn't
exist anymore, Bill.

01:28.338 --> 01:30.798
You won't be
seeing me again.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.393

01:53.197 --> 01:56.491
Is there really any place
left in the universe

01:56.575 --> 01:59.786
deserving of such a rare
and distinguished item?

02:01.205 --> 02:05.249
I was thinking put it in the
bathroom, right over the toilet.

02:05.334 --> 02:06.876
Excellent choice.

Tory, come look at this.
This is the dossier

02:14.426 --> 02:18.012
that Billy prepared for me
my first day aboard Galactica.

02:20.015 --> 02:23.893
I can't believe I was about
to throw this out in the trash.

TORY: The Valkyrie.

02:26.063 --> 02:29.565
This was Adama's command
before Galactica? Mmm-hmm.

02:29.650 --> 02:30.775
Look at that.

02:30.859 --> 02:34.028
This year marks
Admiral Adama's

02:34.112 --> 02:37.323
45th anniversary
in the Colonial Fleet.

In fact, his commissioning
date's only a few days from now.

02:43.580 --> 02:44.622
Here.

02:48.085 --> 02:50.670
I think I want
to have a ceremony.

02:50.754 --> 02:54.423
Let's give the Admiral
a medal

02:54.508 --> 02:57.718
for 45 years
of devoted service.

02:57.803 --> 02:59.428
Couldn't have come
at a better time.

02:59.513 --> 03:02.515
Give the people something to
feel good about for a change.

I repeat, set condition one
throughout the ship.

03:14.069 --> 03:15.528
This is not a drill.

03:15.612 --> 03:17.655
What's the problem?
Three Raiders.

03:17.739 --> 03:20.449
CBDR, bearing 145,
carom 33.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.702
But this isn't their
standard wedge formation.

03:22.786 --> 03:24.328
Where's the CAP?

03:24.413 --> 03:26.914
Starbuck and Kat will
intercept in 98 seconds, sir.

03:26.999 --> 03:29.709
It looks like a pursuit and there's
been weapons exchange between them.

03:29.793 --> 03:32.044
A pursuit?
Yes, sir.

03:32.129 --> 03:35.256
We've got two Raiders
chasing a third.

03:42.139 --> 03:43.806
Have they fired
on any of ours yet?

03:43.891 --> 03:45.308
No, sir.

03:45.392 --> 03:47.643
What the hell
are they doing?

03:50.480 --> 03:53.691
All right, let's see if we can climb
up their asses without drawing any fire.

03:53.775 --> 03:55.693
These two seem pretty
preoccupied with the other one.

03:55.777 --> 03:58.362
Got any idea why Cylons
would be chasing Cylons?

03:58.447 --> 04:00.239
Don't know, don't care.

04:00.324 --> 04:01.657
But wait till
we close the gap.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.035
I don't wanna chase these frakking
things any longer than I have to.

04:04.119 --> 04:05.161
Yeah, roger that.

STARBUCK: Kat, check six.

guy's headed right for Galactica.

the consequences

08:33.930 --> 08:36.348
if you're discovered.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.934
And you understand,
Commander,

08:39.019 --> 08:41.645
that this conversation
did not happen.

Of course, sir.

are gonna be disappointed.

We've checked your DNA signature
against your military records,

09:15.180 --> 09:16.597

You're not a Cylon.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.279
Disappeared about
three years ago.

09:32.364 --> 09:33.906
We think that
he was captured.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.074
I'd like to meet him.

09:35.158 --> 09:37.451
Of course.
I'll arrange it.

09:44.668 --> 09:46.752

09:46.836 --> 09:49.088
Whatever they did
to him out there,

09:49.172 --> 09:52.800
they kept him fed
and relatively healthy.

Physically, anyway.

talk to me, Danny.

did you escape

10:31.339 --> 10:32.965
Well, sir,

10:33.049 --> 10:34.633
it's like this.

10:36.136 --> 10:40.139
The enemy had me locked
in a cell for three years.

10:40.223 --> 10:42.850
The accommodations
were lousy,

10:42.934 --> 10:45.019
the service was slow,

10:45.103 --> 10:49.606
and after a while I felt the institution
no longer had anything to offer me.

10:49.691 --> 10:51.066
So I left.

10:53.403 --> 10:54.695
(CHUCKLES)

10:55.155 --> 10:57.823
You had me worried there
for a moment.

the bullshit attitude out of you.

11:02.746 --> 11:03.996
(LAUGHING)

11:07.625 --> 11:09.501
How'd you get out?

11:15.342 --> 11:18.260
I thought I was gonna
die in there, Bill.

11:22.891 --> 11:26.518
But a while ago, they
all started getting sick.

11:26.603 --> 11:29.396
I mean really sick.

11:31.107 --> 11:32.399
You mean a virus?

11:32.484 --> 11:34.360
Yeah.

11:34.444 --> 11:36.236
We've seen that, too.

11:36.321 --> 11:40.866
I heard them say it was
spreading, getting worse,

11:40.950 --> 11:43.327
but eventually I realize,

11:45.080 --> 11:46.872
I'm not catching it.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.125
I'm immune.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.711
So what did you do?

11:52.796 --> 11:55.714
I was smart,

11:55.799 --> 11:56.882
patient.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.258
I waited.

12:00.095 --> 12:02.262

12:07.310 --> 12:10.396
Me, I've felt better.

I don't know why you
guys do all that exercise.

12:15.318 --> 12:18.362
What, are you trying to
stave off getting old?

12:18.446 --> 12:20.155
(CLANGING)

12:20.657 --> 12:24.243
Doesn't seem such
a tragedy to me,

12:24.327 --> 12:26.912
given the alternatives.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.664
(CLANGING)

12:29.207 --> 12:31.375
You know what I'm saying?

12:35.171 --> 12:37.214
Do I look that bad?

12:37.298 --> 12:38.549
(LAUGHS)

12:40.343 --> 12:42.302
You know what I think?

12:42.387 --> 12:44.346
I think you're afraid.

12:50.353 --> 12:51.353
(SCREAMS)

12:58.528 --> 13:00.863
Let me try and understand
exactly what happened to you.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.698
I'm just gonna
go back a little,

13:02.782 --> 13:03.782
all right?

13:03.867 --> 13:07.786
About a year prior to the
Cylon attack on the Colonies,

13:07.871 --> 13:11.623
you were on a mission with
Admiral Adama. Is that correct?

13:20.216 --> 13:22.968
It was a black ops mission.

13:23.052 --> 13:24.052
Hmm.

13:25.680 --> 13:29.933
You remember the Tauron
colonists were such outlaws,

13:30.018 --> 13:34.104
always pushing their luck with the
Admiralty every chance they got?

13:34.189 --> 13:35.939
ROSLIN: Right.

13:36.024 --> 13:40.360
The Taurons were
drilling for tylium ore

13:40.445 --> 13:44.239
on a moon that was too close
to the Cylon armistice line.

13:48.620 --> 13:51.497
We knew that they had
to get out of there

13:51.581 --> 13:53.916
or risk provoking
the Cylons.

13:56.461 --> 14:00.380
I'm sorry, but how did this
result in his ship being shot down?

14:00.465 --> 14:03.133
He was my recon pilot.

14:03.218 --> 14:05.219
He was there
to gather evidence.

14:05.303 --> 14:09.014
The Taurons must have seen us
coming, because they ambushed him.

14:09.098 --> 14:11.683
Lieutenant Novacek
was shot down

14:11.768 --> 14:14.019
by the Taurons
in cold blood.

14:14.103 --> 14:16.939
NOVACEK: Krypter! Krypter! Krypter!
I've got damage to the port engine.

14:17.232 --> 14:18.815

acquired. NOVACEK: This is Bulldog,

14:23.821 --> 14:25.072

14:25.156 --> 14:27.741
bird is down.
Request rescue.

14:32.747 --> 14:34.706
So what did you do?

14:36.459 --> 14:38.293
I made a bad call.

14:40.797 --> 14:42.881
His ship was gone.

14:42.966 --> 14:45.050
No ejection on dradis.

14:45.134 --> 14:47.135
No distress call.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.804
He was dead,

14:50.390 --> 14:51.974
so I left.

14:54.811 --> 14:58.230
But the lieutenant did eject,
obviously, and somehow survived

14:58.314 --> 15:00.774
in his ejection seat
long enough

15:00.858 --> 15:03.235
for the Cylons
to find him.

15:03.319 --> 15:04.653
Wow.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.407
Could you both give us
a moment, please?

15:08.491 --> 15:10.742
Thank you, Tory, and thank
you very much, Lieutenant,

15:10.827 --> 15:12.828
I appreciate it.
Madam President.

15:13.663 --> 15:16.081
Why don't we check
the fleet registry,

15:16.165 --> 15:18.500
see if any of your family
might have survived?

15:39.314 --> 15:43.525
So, are you gonna tell me
what really happened?

15:43.610 --> 15:46.194
You're gonna have to trust me
on this one, okay?

15:46.279 --> 15:48.530
It's my mess.

15:48.615 --> 15:49.615
I'll fix it.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.538
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

16:17.060 --> 16:19.186
Okay, this is the last one.
Yeah.

I see it.

17:45.690 --> 17:46.773
I see it.

17:53.573 --> 17:54.698
I see it.

17:56.159 --> 17:57.909
Daniel Novacek

17:57.994 --> 18:01.913
just escaped from a POW cell
on a Cylon baseship,

18:01.998 --> 18:05.333
stole a Raider,
flew it here.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.419
I just finished
debriefing him.

18:07.503 --> 18:09.212
Bulldog's alive?

18:09.297 --> 18:10.797
Yeah.

18:10.882 --> 18:13.049
My Gods.

18:13.134 --> 18:15.761
How could he be alive?

18:15.845 --> 18:18.930
That tough son of a bitch, he
actually made it, didn't he?

18:19.015 --> 18:21.308
Yeah, I guess he did.

18:21.392 --> 18:26.104
So, are you here to talk
to your friend or to your XO?

18:26.189 --> 18:28.940
And last time I checked,
I was neither.

18:31.986 --> 18:35.030
Oh... I get it.

18:36.908 --> 18:38.784
Oh, yeah.

18:38.868 --> 18:45.081
This is gonna be a little complicated
for you, isn't it, Admiral?

18:45.166 --> 18:46.833
You gonna tell him
what you did?

18:46.918 --> 18:48.585
I did what I had to do.

18:48.669 --> 18:51.922
So tell him.

18:52.006 --> 18:54.466
It's not gonna make any
difference. The past is the past.

18:54.550 --> 18:56.343
You're equivocating.

18:56.469 --> 18:59.471
I don't know why the frak
I came here. Tell him!

18:59.555 --> 19:01.681
He's gonna find out

19:01.766 --> 19:03.558
sooner or later.

19:13.069 --> 19:14.277

It's really you.

20:15.298 --> 20:17.507

20:17.592 --> 20:19.175
I heard you'd made it.

20:19.260 --> 20:21.261
Good for you, Bulldog.

20:24.432 --> 20:26.349
Oh, Gods.

20:26.434 --> 20:27.642

20:30.104 --> 20:31.605

20:31.689 --> 20:34.524
You have no idea.

20:34.609 --> 20:36.192
Yes, I do.

(DOOR OPENS)

20:47.163 --> 20:49.706
Dad?

20:49.790 --> 20:52.250
Hey, I just got your message.

20:52.335 --> 20:54.002
Thank you for coming.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.378
Sit down.

20:55.463 --> 20:57.547
It's time for us to talk.

21:05.306 --> 21:07.140
Let me ask you something.

21:07.224 --> 21:08.433
How often you get
out of here?

21:08.517 --> 21:10.185
Why? All the time.

21:11.896 --> 21:14.314
I've been a little under
the weather, that's all.

21:14.398 --> 21:17.901
And how'd you wind up
on this old bucket anyway?

21:17.985 --> 21:19.694
What happened
to the Valkyrie?

21:19.779 --> 21:21.821
Well, let's just say

21:23.366 --> 21:27.869
that last mission wasn't exactly
a boon to the old man's career.

21:27.954 --> 21:31.498
Galactica was his
graceful retirement.

21:31.582 --> 21:34.501
Heard you and the old man
haven't spoken in a while.

21:34.585 --> 21:36.211
What's wrong?

21:36.295 --> 21:38.797
He won't cover your ass
day and night like he used to?

21:38.881 --> 21:42.634
Oh, no, he still does
his share of ass-covering.

21:42.718 --> 21:46.096
Problem is,
it's his main function now.

21:46.180 --> 21:47.722
Of course,

21:47.807 --> 21:51.476
considering how you wound up
getting captured in the first place,

21:51.560 --> 21:56.314
I guess you found that out the
hard way yourself, didn't you?

21:56.399 --> 21:58.650
What's that supposed to mean?

22:01.070 --> 22:03.488
My Gods.

22:03.572 --> 22:06.032
He didn't tell you, did he?

22:09.370 --> 22:10.870
Did he?

22:10.955 --> 22:12.497
Tell me what?

22:14.291 --> 22:17.627
That son of a bitch.

22:23.092 --> 22:25.218
I shot him down.

22:30.599 --> 22:32.976
Well, if you shot him down,
you had your reasons.

22:33.060 --> 22:35.103
You were
following orders,

22:35.187 --> 22:37.814
preventing something worse,
right?

22:37.898 --> 22:39.899
No.

22:39.984 --> 22:42.986
I shot him down to avoid

22:43.070 --> 22:45.196
detection.

22:45.281 --> 22:48.033
Protect the mission,

22:48.117 --> 22:51.119
so it wouldn't be
discovered by the Cylons.

22:56.625 --> 22:59.794
It was a black ops mission

22:59.879 --> 23:02.630
whose sole purpose

23:02.715 --> 23:06.134
was to ascertain the
likelihood of a Cylon strike.

23:10.473 --> 23:12.390
"Cylon strike"?

23:22.151 --> 23:25.528
So, you're saying that...

23:25.613 --> 23:29.783
That we knew
they were out there?

23:29.867 --> 23:33.995
That they could launch
an attack on the Colonies?

23:34.080 --> 23:38.666
We didn't know
anything for sure.

23:38.751 --> 23:41.544
There were theories
in some circles

23:41.629 --> 23:46.466
that the reason that the Cylons
had stayed dormant for so long

23:46.550 --> 23:51.012
was because they were
building a war machine,

23:51.097 --> 23:53.056
preparing a strike.

23:56.018 --> 23:57.644
But I thought...

23:57.728 --> 24:01.815
I thought that no one had seen or
heard from the Cylons in over 40 years.

24:01.899 --> 24:04.692
That's true, partially.

24:07.404 --> 24:12.617
The Admiralty had grown restless
with the Adar administration.

24:12.701 --> 24:14.619
They thought we were
resting on our laurels,

24:14.703 --> 24:19.082
unprepared to protect
against an attack.

24:19.166 --> 24:22.544
My mission was to escort
a stealth recon ship

24:22.628 --> 24:25.296
just beyond
the armistice line.

24:25.381 --> 24:29.425
Stick our nose over,
gather evidence,

24:29.510 --> 24:32.679
see if there was
any suspicious activities.

24:32.763 --> 24:37.100
And if the Cylons discovered
you had crossed the line,

24:37.184 --> 24:40.353
breaching the armistice,
then they would see that as...

24:40.437 --> 24:42.438
An act of war.

24:46.402 --> 24:49.320
MAN: Stealthstar, Valkyrie.
We register you on dradis,

24:49.405 --> 24:50.989
just past the armistice line.

24:51.073 --> 24:53.366
You're on full alert.
Proceed with caution.

24:53.450 --> 24:56.870
Valkyrie, Bulldog.

24:56.954 --> 24:59.539
I'm exactly two clicks
past the line.

24:59.623 --> 25:01.624
Repeat, two clicks
and I've got

25:01.709 --> 25:04.544
negative dradis contacts.

25:04.628 --> 25:06.504
Sir, there's
nothing here, sir.

25:06.589 --> 25:09.090

25:51.675 --> 25:54.719

You don't want to do this.

25:54.803 --> 25:57.722
Do you want his ship
discovered?

25:57.806 --> 25:59.849
Do you know
where we are?

25:59.934 --> 26:04.062

what this could mean?

26:43.185 --> 26:44.936
And you know it's true.

26:45.020 --> 26:48.022
You've known it every second
of every day since it happened.

26:48.107 --> 26:49.274
And the sooner
you admit it,

26:49.358 --> 26:53.111
the sooner you might get that
haunted look out of your eyes.

26:53.195 --> 26:54.988
Listen to me.

26:56.031 --> 26:59.575
Sometimes surviving can be
its own death sentence.

27:01.662 --> 27:02.996

on Novacek's ship,

27:25.811 --> 27:27.812
the one that winged him

27:27.896 --> 27:31.399
and the two dradis contacts
that were following him,

27:31.483 --> 27:35.278
they weren't Taurons.
Those were the Cylons.

27:36.822 --> 27:39.824
For all those years,
I told myself

27:39.908 --> 27:43.202
that I didn't know
what they were.

27:43.287 --> 27:45.663
But I was just
lying to myself.

27:45.748 --> 27:48.333
Pretending that it
couldn't be true.

27:54.590 --> 27:55.757
It is true.

28:04.725 --> 28:07.852
I started it.

28:07.936 --> 28:10.021
Initiated it.

28:10.105 --> 28:11.689
Wait a minute.

28:11.774 --> 28:13.608
You started what?

28:13.692 --> 28:15.401
Started what?

28:15.486 --> 28:17.570
The attacks
on the Colonies.

28:21.450 --> 28:23.493
By crossing the line,

28:23.577 --> 28:25.370
I showed them that

28:25.454 --> 28:27.705
we were the warmongers

28:27.790 --> 28:29.582
they figured us to be.

28:35.172 --> 28:38.966
And I...

28:39.051 --> 28:42.887
I left them
but one choice.

28:42.971 --> 28:45.098
To attack us

28:45.182 --> 28:47.517
before we attacked them.

28:47.601 --> 28:50.728
No. No.

28:50.813 --> 28:53.898
Because it wasn't
just you.

28:53.982 --> 28:55.066
They put you there.

28:55.150 --> 28:58.820
They put you there, across
the line. You had no choice.

28:58.904 --> 29:02.573
That was the Admiralty. That
was the... That was the military.

29:02.658 --> 29:04.784
You were one mission.

29:04.868 --> 29:06.994
You were one man.

Hold on.
I'll be right there.

32:46.256 --> 32:48.299
The Cylons are
saddled up on him.

32:48.383 --> 32:52.219
They've got a perfect
point-blank, no-deflection shot.

32:52.304 --> 32:53.763
They had him dead to rights.

32:53.847 --> 32:55.139
I'd say so.

32:55.223 --> 32:59.477
Look, Novacek was hit and
smoking, flying straight and level.

32:59.561 --> 33:01.395
Any nugget could
make that kill.

33:01.480 --> 33:06.317
The Cylons could've wasted him any
number of times, and they didn't.

33:06.401 --> 33:08.861
They didn't.
They let him escape.

33:13.659 --> 33:17.203
The Cylons don't do
anything by accident.

33:17.287 --> 33:20.122
Yeah, that's what
I was thinking, too.

33:23.418 --> 33:24.919
Did Novacek say

33:25.003 --> 33:28.798
how he was able to overcome the
Cylons that were holding him prisoner?

33:28.882 --> 33:31.592
They were sick?
Had a virus?

33:33.095 --> 33:35.304
I mean, how many viruses
do the Cylons have, sir?

33:35.389 --> 33:37.348
Who knows?
Maybe it was the same virus

33:37.432 --> 33:39.684
those Cylons we found
were suffering from.

33:39.768 --> 33:42.728
Yeah, or maybe they just
told us a story that we'd buy.

33:42.813 --> 33:45.314
Something that was
credible, familiar.

33:47.317 --> 33:50.903

on a baseship for three years,

33:50.987 --> 33:53.656
escapes, and then conveniently
finds our fleet

and no reason to be here.

What stupid, frakked-up

35:00.348 --> 35:04.310
You didn't think I was alive. You
weren't even hoping I was alive!

35:06.021 --> 35:08.689
And if I hadn't
figured a way to escape,

35:08.774 --> 35:13.611
if I didn't make my move when I saw
they left that door wide open for me,

35:13.695 --> 35:15.905
I'd be as good as dead
right now!

35:18.533 --> 35:19.784
(COUGHING)

35:20.368 --> 35:22.620
Is that what they did?

35:22.704 --> 35:24.371
Did they leave the door
standing open?

35:24.456 --> 35:25.998
Did they let you escape?

35:26.082 --> 35:28.292
That's not what I meant.

35:28.376 --> 35:30.669
I know the truth.

35:30.754 --> 35:33.547
I beat them.
Do you understand?

35:33.632 --> 35:36.467
I beat them
at their own game.

35:36.551 --> 35:40.095
I frakking killed her,
and I escaped.

35:40.180 --> 35:42.515
You trying to take that
away from me?

35:42.682 --> 35:44.141
(GUN CLICKS)
TIGH: Bulldog!

35:54.027 --> 35:55.611
Stay down!

35:57.614 --> 36:00.241
Are you all right, Bill?

36:00.325 --> 36:01.659
Yeah, I'm okay.

36:03.203 --> 36:05.788
You don't wanna believe
it, do you? I know.

36:05.872 --> 36:07.581
The truth hurts, Bulldog,

36:07.666 --> 36:10.793
but it's better to know the
truth than to live a lie.

36:10.877 --> 36:12.503
We're all soldiers, Danny.

36:12.587 --> 36:14.171
We're all expendable.

36:14.256 --> 36:17.049
And we did what we had to do
to protect the mission.

36:17.133 --> 36:20.845
It's ugly, but there it is.
The Cylons let you go.

36:20.929 --> 36:24.807
The question is, why?
Ask yourself that, Danny.

36:24.891 --> 36:26.392
Because up until
a minute ago,

36:26.476 --> 36:29.144
you were doing exactly
what they wanted you to do.

36:29.229 --> 36:32.231
Come here and learn the truth
and seek revenge.

36:32.315 --> 36:34.775
And that's exactly
what you did.

36:34.860 --> 36:37.111
You almost gave them
what they wanted.

36:44.953 --> 36:46.829
Tell you a dirty
little secret.

36:46.913 --> 36:49.456
The toughest part
of getting played

36:49.541 --> 36:51.458
is losing your dignity.

36:53.628 --> 36:57.756
Feeling like you are not worth
the oxygen you are sucking down.

36:59.634 --> 37:02.261
You get used to it.

37:02.345 --> 37:05.222
You start to believe it.

37:05.307 --> 37:07.016
You start to love it.

37:07.100 --> 37:09.143
It's like a bottle
that never runs dry.

37:09.227 --> 37:15.024
You can keep reaching for it
over and over and over again.

37:15.108 --> 37:17.985
So, how do you put
that bottle away, Saul?

37:23.325 --> 37:25.117
I don't know.

37:26.745 --> 37:29.663
One day, you just decide to

37:31.666 --> 37:33.667
get up and walk
out of your room.

37:48.183 --> 37:49.934
ROSLIN: What is this?

37:55.023 --> 37:58.359
Your resignation? You
have gotta be kidding me.

38:00.695 --> 38:03.113
I've said before,

38:03.198 --> 38:06.033
we can't hide from the things
that we've done.

38:06.117 --> 38:09.411
I see no other way
around this situation.

38:09.496 --> 38:11.538
Maybe it's time, Laura.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.290
Sit down, Bill.

38:22.509 --> 38:25.344
I think you're being naive.

38:25.428 --> 38:27.137
"Naive"?

38:27.222 --> 38:29.264
Did it ever occur to you
that the Admiralty

38:29.349 --> 38:32.893
may have set you up
to provoke a war they wanted?

38:35.271 --> 38:38.482
It's naive to think that horrible
things that we can't understand

38:38.566 --> 38:41.068
have simple explanations.

38:41.152 --> 38:46.699
Because simple explanations make us
feel like we have control when we don't.

38:46.783 --> 38:49.618
We know why the Cylons
attacked us,

38:49.703 --> 38:52.371
and it wasn't any one thing.
Oh, my Gods!

38:54.124 --> 38:56.041
We did a thousand things,

38:56.126 --> 38:58.043
good and bad,

38:58.128 --> 39:02.131
every day for 40 years to
pave the way for those attacks.

39:04.843 --> 39:06.927
Something has to be done.

39:14.602 --> 39:16.603
You know what that is?

39:25.697 --> 39:27.948
Medal of distinction.

39:31.119 --> 39:34.121
This was before I heard about
this resignation of yours.

39:34.205 --> 39:35.539
So...

39:38.918 --> 39:41.211
I'd like to propose this.

39:41.296 --> 39:44.214
You seem hell-bent on
paying some kind of penance

39:44.299 --> 39:48.052
for whatever it is
you think you've done.

39:48.136 --> 39:51.221
So instead of resigning, why don't
you get up and walk out of here,

39:51.306 --> 39:54.641
meet me on the port hangar deck
tomorrow evening for this ceremony,

39:54.726 --> 39:57.144
and let me pin a frakking
medal to your chest?

39:59.439 --> 40:00.939
I can't.

40:01.024 --> 40:02.649
It's not for you.

40:02.734 --> 40:04.485
It's for them.

40:05.820 --> 40:08.405
Stand up there,
acknowledge your fleet,

40:08.490 --> 40:10.908
and give them
what they need.

40:10.992 --> 40:13.327
A hero.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.871
That'll be your penance,

40:15.955 --> 40:17.956
even if it kills you.

40:27.467 --> 40:30.928
ROSLIN: On behalf of everyone in this
room, it is my pleasure to present you,

40:31.012 --> 40:32.679
Admiral Adama,

40:32.764 --> 40:34.014
with the medal of distinction

40:34.140 --> 40:38.727
for your 45 years of courageous
service to the Colonial Fleet.

40:38.812 --> 40:40.020
Congratulations.

41:19.435 --> 41:22.604
Have Dr. Stoffa call me
as soon as you arrive.

41:22.689 --> 41:25.232
And, Bulldog,
you're gonna be fine.

41:25.316 --> 41:28.110
Just remember it'll take
some time. All right.

41:29.904 --> 41:31.405
Lieutenant,

41:34.367 --> 41:35.742
you forgot something.

41:38.496 --> 41:41.999
I can't. Bill, I...
Take it.

41:42.083 --> 41:43.917
You're not getting off
that easy.

41:48.715 --> 41:51.258
Once a pilot,
always a pilot, Bulldog.

41:55.388 --> 41:56.972
Yes, sir.

42:29.380 --> 42:31.048
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

42:32.217 --> 42:33.967
ADAMA: Come in.

42:48.358 --> 42:50.359
I heard you won a medal.

42:52.237 --> 42:53.362
Yeah.

42:54.489 --> 42:57.157
They give them out
for anything these days.

42:59.077 --> 43:01.161
Good behavior,

43:02.455 --> 43:05.332
attendance,
playing well with others.

43:18.846 --> 43:21.682
I need you back
in the CIC.

43:21.766 --> 43:25.018
It just ain't the same without you
in there intimidating the inmates.

43:25.103 --> 43:26.311
No.

43:29.899 --> 43:32.985
That's not what I came here
to talk to you about.

43:33.069 --> 43:34.194
Okay.

43:35.863 --> 43:37.614
So, why are you here?

43:37.699 --> 43:40.325
I don't know. Nothing.

43:43.579 --> 43:46.373
You wanna tell me
what happened to Ellen?

43:47.500 --> 43:48.709
(SIGHS)

43:53.381 --> 43:55.465
I could use a drink.

43:58.261 --> 43:59.386
Me, too.

44:31.919 --> 44:33.587
