00:39.916 --> 00:41.952
( knock at door)

00:42.126 --> 00:44.538
- Ma'am?
- Hi, Lizzie.

00:48.883 --> 00:51.795
They told me to come down here.

00:51.969 --> 00:53.800
Are you okay?

00:54.889 --> 00:57.005
Good.

00:59.644 --> 01:02.260
I wanted to see you
because I'm going on a run with Rick.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.304
(faint sloshing )

01:05.483 --> 01:07.599
Lizzie:
Do you think Daryl's dead?

01:07.777 --> 01:08.937
Carol:
No.

01:09.111 --> 01:10.772
He had to go far away
to get the medicine,

01:10.947 --> 01:13.233
so it's gonna take a while.

01:17.453 --> 01:19.239
We lost all our food in cell block D,

01:19.413 --> 01:23.076
so we're gonna go look for more
and whatever else we can find.

01:27.964 --> 01:30.125
Lizzie:
Nobody's died yet.

01:30.299 --> 01:31.914
Yet?

01:32.093 --> 01:33.799
I think a lot of people
are going to die.

01:33.970 --> 01:36.461
It's what always happens.

01:36.639 --> 01:38.971
Makes me sad, but...

01:39.141 --> 01:40.551
at least they get to come back.

01:40.726 --> 01:43.968
Lizzie, when they come back,
they aren't--

01:44.146 --> 01:45.886
people aren't who they were.

01:46.065 --> 01:48.647
Yeah, but they're something.

01:48.818 --> 01:49.978
They're someone.

01:52.989 --> 01:54.479
I'm little now.

01:54.657 --> 01:57.490
If I don't die, I'll get big.

01:57.660 --> 02:00.527
I'll be me, but I'll be different.

02:00.705 --> 02:02.366
It's how it is.

02:10.673 --> 02:13.210
(coughing)

02:16.012 --> 02:18.003
(grunts)

02:18.180 --> 02:19.795
Lizzie:
We all change.

02:19.974 --> 02:22.636
We all don't get to stay
the same way we started.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.516
Lizzie, it's more complicated--

02:24.687 --> 02:27.349
You said I was weak.
I'm not.

02:27.523 --> 02:30.356
l'm strong,
so I'm telling you what I think.

02:40.369 --> 02:42.360
You remember what I told you to do
when there's danger?

02:42.538 --> 02:44.119
Run as fast as I can.

02:44.290 --> 02:46.872
You run and run until you're safe.

02:50.629 --> 02:53.462
And if it's your life
or your sister's life,

02:53.632 --> 02:55.543
you can't be afraid to kill.

02:55.718 --> 02:57.379
Understand?

02:57.553 --> 02:59.214
Yes.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.556
Carol:
You are strong, Lizzie.

03:04.727 --> 03:06.342
You're gonna live.

03:07.813 --> 03:10.725
You, your sister,
and me--

03:10.900 --> 03:13.482
we're gonna survive, I know it.

03:14.987 --> 03:17.103
Where's your knife?

03:19.116 --> 03:20.777
Put your T-shirt behind it.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.816
You've gotta be able
to get to it quickly.

03:22.995 --> 03:24.326
Yes, Mom.
I mean ma'am.

03:24.497 --> 03:26.533
Do
nl
t call me "M
om."

03:27.833 --> 03:29.824
It was an accident.

03:31.420 --> 03:32.751
Just don't.

03:34.090 --> 03:36.046
Okay.

03:39.095 --> 03:40.551
Carol:
What is it?

03:40.721 --> 03:44.179
Lizzie:
I'm not afraid to kill.

03:44.350 --> 03:46.090
I'm just afraid.

03:47.269 --> 03:48.805
You can't be.

03:50.231 --> 03:51.937
How?

03:52.108 --> 03:53.598
You fight it.

03:54.652 --> 03:57.234
And fight it.

03:57.405 --> 03:59.236
You don't give up.

04:00.950 --> 04:03.282
And then one day,

04:03.452 --> 04:06.944
you just change.

04:10.626 --> 04:12.537
We all change.

04:24.723 --> 04:27.965
(theme music playing )

05:09.059 --> 05:10.390
Michonne:
This is Turner Creek,

05:10.561 --> 05:12.847
so Barnesville must be
a few miles downstream.

05:13.022 --> 05:15.559
Bob: Sounds like our best chance
at finding a new ride.

05:15.733 --> 05:18.145
Daryl:
Yo, Ty.

05:19.862 --> 05:22.695
Come on, let's go.
Vémonos.

05:31.415 --> 05:32.951
Ty.

05:34.043 --> 05:35.533
Ty!

05:37.213 --> 05:38.999
There should be a town
a few miles south.

05:39.173 --> 05:40.959
Lost a whole night.

05:43.802 --> 05:48.045
My sister,
everybody else--

05:49.058 --> 05:50.389
they're probably dead.

05:50.559 --> 05:52.390
Well, it helps
to keep moving.

05:54.230 --> 05:56.687
No, it doesn't.

06:21.257 --> 06:24.090
Maggie wanted to come, you know.

06:24.260 --> 06:27.923
Someone had to stay back,
watch over things.

06:28.931 --> 06:31.263
Someone you trust,
you mean.

06:37.523 --> 06:40.139
They would have drowned
in their own blood.

06:40.317 --> 06:43.104
They were suffering.
I made it quick.

06:47.324 --> 06:48.484
We needed the bodies gone.

06:48.659 --> 06:50.945
We needed to stop it from spreading.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.452
They were the only ones
who were sick.

06:53.622 --> 06:54.782
They were a threat.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.703
l was trying to save lives.

06:58.877 --> 07:01.584
I had to try.
Somebody had to.

07:05.593 --> 07:07.879
Maybe.

07:24.320 --> 07:26.606
- Is that jasper?
- Mm-hmm.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.112
It's a good color.
Brings out your eyes.

07:32.703 --> 07:35.945
When Miss Richards went into A block,
we were leaving.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.990
Asked me to keep a lookout.

07:39.168 --> 07:41.500
I'm gonna use it
for her old man's marker.

07:41.670 --> 07:44.787
You know all them back there?

07:44.965 --> 07:47.672
You stay in one place
more than a couple hours,

07:47.843 --> 07:49.799
you'd be surprised what you pick up.

07:54.600 --> 07:57.592
( crows cawing )

08:24.713 --> 08:26.874
Carol:
Think they're coming back?

08:27.049 --> 08:30.132
Windshield's clean,
wiped down.

08:30.302 --> 08:33.089
Can't have been here
more than a day, maybe two.

08:33.263 --> 08:36.221
You mean Daryl and the others.
That's what this is, right?

08:36.392 --> 08:37.973
In case they don't?

08:39.103 --> 08:42.095
Until they do.
That's what this is.

08:42.272 --> 08:44.763
Medicine cabinets,
first aid kits--

08:44.942 --> 08:48.855
anything that could help Hershel.
We get in, we get out.

08:49.029 --> 08:52.692
And if we can eat it, we take it.

08:54.702 --> 08:57.284
(wood creaking )

09:18.058 --> 09:19.389
You see something?

09:20.561 --> 09:22.927
I don't know. Maybe.

09:33.115 --> 09:35.071
(sighs)

09:38.203 --> 09:40.364
We gotta find us a new battery.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.913
-(spHs)
- ( walkers snarling )

09:48.046 --> 09:50.082
Got some friends inside.

09:51.133 --> 09:53.249
Come on.

09:54.261 --> 09:57.469
Let's clear a path,
see how many we got.

10:01.810 --> 10:05.473
(grunting)

10:07.024 --> 10:10.516
Hey, man, go easy.
We don't know what we're dealing with.

10:13.363 --> 10:14.944
- ( grunting)
- ( door rattling)

10:21.497 --> 10:23.283
(door rattling )

10:25.042 --> 10:27.033
(walker gasping )

10:34.551 --> 10:36.803
(walker growls )

10:38.847 --> 10:41.554
-(growli
n
- Ah! 9)

11:01.370 --> 11:02.906
Bob:
Tyreese!

11:04.373 --> 11:05.738
Ty!

11:05.916 --> 11:07.827
Ty, let him go.

11:09.586 --> 11:12.578
(grunting)

11:27.271 --> 11:30.013
Why the hell didn't you let go?

11:37.072 --> 11:39.063
(door creaking )

12:28.457 --> 12:29.788
(faint snarling )

12:29.958 --> 12:31.949
(growling)

12:33.837 --> 12:34.917
Carol!

12:48.518 --> 12:50.474
( door opens)

12:53.315 --> 12:56.307
( door creaks)

13:04.660 --> 13:08.448
Whoa, whoa. It's cool.
We're-- we're cool.

13:08.622 --> 13:10.408
We have fruit.

13:10.582 --> 13:13.198
Man: Yeah, we got
apricots, peaches.

13:13.377 --> 13:15.163
Here, catch.

13:18.840 --> 13:21.547
Or, you know, don't.
( chuckles )

13:30.894 --> 13:33.852
- Carol: How'd this happen?
- Greenhouse around the corner.

13:34.022 --> 13:35.762
We were looking for a place to crash.

13:35.941 --> 13:38.808
The roof's broken now and it's been
getting rain, so it's full of fruit.

13:38.986 --> 13:41.477
We were there about a day
and the skin-eaters showed up.

13:41.655 --> 13:43.270
( laughs )
Killjoys, man.

13:43.448 --> 13:45.359
Jackin' it up
for the whole world.

13:45.534 --> 13:48.321
I thought everybody was an asshole
before this all went down.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.360
Now I love people.

13:50.539 --> 13:53.201
You know-- people
who are alive.

13:53.375 --> 13:54.535
How did it happen?

13:54.710 --> 13:56.325
When they were coming in
through the door,

13:56.503 --> 13:58.664
l tripped crawling out
the other side.

13:58.839 --> 14:01.501
Pulled the glass out,
but my shoulder--

14:01.675 --> 14:03.165
it still hurts like a bitch.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.880
It's dislocated.

14:06.054 --> 14:08.670
Can you fix it?

14:08.849 --> 14:10.635
Here, lay on your back.

14:16.565 --> 14:18.977
Okay, scooch over to the edge.

14:19.151 --> 14:22.063
Just hold your arm...

14:22.237 --> 14:24.353
Grab ahold of this bag.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.738
- Hold on.
- ( groaning)

14:26.908 --> 14:29.399
- And keep holding on.
- ( crying ) No, that hurts.

14:29.578 --> 14:30.693
Keep holding.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.327
I can't, I can't.

14:32.497 --> 14:33.953
Keep holding.

14:34.124 --> 14:35.785
-( bone crackles )
- ( groaning )

14:36.960 --> 14:39.451
( man gasping )

14:41.256 --> 14:43.247
-( bone pops)
- ( panting )

14:45.218 --> 14:46.799
Sit up.

14:49.598 --> 14:50.929
Woman:
Is it...

14:52.142 --> 14:54.474
Yeah.

14:54.644 --> 14:57.602
It's gonna be sore for a few days.

14:57.773 --> 14:59.980
After the greenhouse,
you came here?

15:00.150 --> 15:02.141
Yeah. We thought
it was clear.

15:02.319 --> 15:05.857
We missed the deadie in the PJs,
so we dove into the bathroom.

15:06.031 --> 15:08.113
So how long were you up there
till we showed up?

15:08.283 --> 15:09.784
Like, two days.

15:09.951 --> 15:12.112
There was just one.
You had guns.

15:12.287 --> 15:13.948
We have about 12 bullets.

15:14.122 --> 15:17.285
It usually take us about five or six
to bring one of them down.

15:17.459 --> 15:18.790
But you have knives.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.575
To what, stab it in the head?

15:20.754 --> 15:22.119
Yeah.

15:22.297 --> 15:24.583
We got separated from
our crew about a week ago.

15:24.758 --> 15:27.295
Been trying to play it safe
since it's just the two of us.

15:27.469 --> 15:29.460
- l have to with my leg.
- Yeah.

15:29.638 --> 15:32.801
We were at a refugee center together
and there was a fire.

15:32.974 --> 15:34.714
People were just
trampling over me.

15:34.893 --> 15:36.224
Assholes.

15:36.394 --> 15:38.180
Sam saved my life.

15:38.355 --> 15:39.435
We didn't know each other before.

15:39.606 --> 15:42.313
It didn't heal right,
but it healed.

15:42.484 --> 15:44.270
And we found each other.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.685
It was worth it.

15:46.863 --> 15:48.478
Where are you two headed next?

15:48.657 --> 15:49.817
Wejust keep moving.

15:49.991 --> 15:53.199
We haven't been waiting
for places to go bad.

15:53.370 --> 15:55.486
I mean, it's getting a little old.

15:55.664 --> 15:58.030
You guys look all right.
What's your setup like?

15:58.208 --> 16:00.199
The "skin-eaters"?

16:00.377 --> 16:02.584
We call them walkers.

16:06.550 --> 16:08.836
How many have you killed?

16:09.010 --> 16:10.841
( door creaks)

16:20.897 --> 16:22.888
Come on.

16:30.198 --> 16:32.314
Here we go.

16:46.631 --> 16:49.213
Hmm, cells look pretty dry.

16:49.384 --> 16:51.375
A little distilled water
will clear that right up.

16:58.560 --> 17:00.551
You should have let him go.

17:01.605 --> 17:03.436
The hell you know about it, huh?

17:03.607 --> 17:05.689
- You the damn expert?
- No.

17:05.859 --> 17:08.191
| just don't want to see you die.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.397
Is that what you're trying to do?

17:11.656 --> 17:14.238
Do you even know
what you're trying to do?

17:15.285 --> 17:17.776
I know you're pissed.

17:17.954 --> 17:20.206
And you have every reason to be.

17:21.666 --> 17:24.123
But anger makes you stupid.

17:25.212 --> 17:28.079
Stupid gets you killed.

17:28.256 --> 17:31.498
Aren't you still angry
about the Governor?

17:31.676 --> 17:33.212
What he did?

17:33.386 --> 17:35.502
If he was here right now,

17:35.680 --> 17:38.467
l'd cut him in two.

17:38.642 --> 17:40.849
'Cause that's how it needs to be.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.765
But I'm not angry.

17:46.775 --> 17:49.266
l was.

17:49.444 --> 17:51.935
Then why are you still
going out looking for him?

18:01.206 --> 18:02.992
I don't know.

18:06.628 --> 18:08.619
(grunting)

18:14.803 --> 18:16.794
Daryl:
That's puke.

18:18.348 --> 18:21.010
Those douchebags in the vines

18:21.184 --> 18:23.175
took themselves out,

18:23.353 --> 18:24.718
holding hands--

18:24.896 --> 18:27.433
kumbaya style.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.518
They wanted to go out together
same as they lived.

18:29.693 --> 18:31.103
That make them douchebags?

18:31.278 --> 18:34.145
It does if they could have gotten out.

18:34.322 --> 18:38.486
Everybody makes it,
till they don't.

18:38.660 --> 18:40.776
People nowadays
are dominoes.

18:40.954 --> 18:44.037
What they did, maybe it's about not
having to watch them fall.

18:45.333 --> 18:46.834
Right.

18:49.546 --> 18:51.628
( raspy breathing )

18:51.798 --> 18:53.129
Come on.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.293
(grunts)

19:37.385 --> 19:38.886
We got about all
we're gonna get here.

19:39.054 --> 19:40.544
We should move on.

19:40.722 --> 19:42.963
So, did we pass your test?

19:49.397 --> 19:51.888
We're in a prison eight miles north.

19:52.067 --> 19:55.525
If you come back with us,
we can't guarantee your safety.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.936
There's an illness, a flu.

19:58.114 --> 20:00.070
It's bad.

20:00.241 --> 20:01.572
We've lost a lot.

20:01.743 --> 20:03.608
- Kids, too.
- Yours?

20:04.621 --> 20:06.407
No, thank God.

20:07.624 --> 20:09.535
But one of my girls, she's got it.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.826
- I'm sorry.
- She's strong. She'll make it.

20:14.089 --> 20:15.920
Sam:
You got fences and walls?

20:16.091 --> 20:18.582
- We're in.
- Yeah, whatever you need us to do.

20:18.760 --> 20:20.876
For now, sit tight.

20:21.054 --> 20:23.386
The two of us will circle back for you
before dark.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.763
Or you could help us sweep
the rest of this neighborhood.

20:25.934 --> 20:27.799
Woman: We can do that.
I can check the greenhouse,

20:27.977 --> 20:29.308
see if it's clear,
bring back more fruit.

20:29.479 --> 20:30.810
And I can hit
some of the houses.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.436
Well, it's nice
of you to offer,

20:32.607 --> 20:34.347
but your shoulder's
barely--

20:34.526 --> 20:36.892
Sam: As long as I don't put too much
weight on this arm, I'm good.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.435
Woman: And I can
still move pretty fast.

20:38.613 --> 20:41.605
- | just don't think--
- We won't take any chances.

20:41.783 --> 20:44.490
We'll look.
And if it's cake, we'll do it.

20:44.661 --> 20:47.573
If not,
we'll just roll.

20:47.747 --> 20:50.489
I mean, you don't look
so good yourself, man.

20:50.667 --> 20:52.157
Are you a righty
or a lefty?

20:53.461 --> 20:57.329
We'll cover more ground.
The sooner we get back...

20:57.507 --> 20:58.838
Sam:
You can't carry us, man.

20:59.008 --> 21:02.967
- It doesn't work that way.
- Please, we want to help.

21:12.647 --> 21:15.514
You fire a shot,
we'll come running.

21:15.692 --> 21:18.308
Let's meet back here in two hours.

21:24.284 --> 21:26.275
You'll need this.

21:29.789 --> 21:33.623
You never told us about the group
you were with before.

21:35.128 --> 21:37.039
Which one?

21:41.718 --> 21:44.755
You know, when you found me
out on that road,

21:44.929 --> 21:46.669
I almost kept walking.

21:46.848 --> 21:49.305
Why is that?

21:49.476 --> 21:51.341
'Cause l was done
being a witness.

21:51.519 --> 21:55.011
Two times,
two different groups.

21:56.691 --> 21:58.227
l was the last one standing.

21:59.861 --> 22:02.523
Like l was supposed
to see it happen over and over,

22:02.697 --> 22:04.733
like it's some kind of curse.

22:08.870 --> 22:13.079
But, when it's just you
out there with the quiet...

22:15.293 --> 22:17.033
Used to be l'd drink
a bottle of anything

22:17.212 --> 22:18.918
just so I could shut my eyes at night.

22:19.088 --> 22:23.047
Figured the prison, the people,
thought it'd be easier.

22:23.218 --> 22:27.461
The run to the Big Spot,
I did it for me.

22:27.639 --> 22:29.220
You gotta keep busy.

22:29.390 --> 22:32.177
No. I did it so I could get me
a bottle.

22:32.352 --> 22:35.389
Of anything.

22:35.563 --> 22:38.270
I picked it up,
I held it in my hand,

22:38.441 --> 22:40.147
but I put it down.

22:40.318 --> 22:43.060
I put it down so hard
it took the whole damn shelf with it.

22:43.238 --> 22:45.069
That's what brought on the walkers,

22:45.240 --> 22:47.526
and that's what got Zack killed.

22:52.413 --> 22:53.914
That's bullshit.

22:59.254 --> 23:00.710
Why don't you get in there
and try the engine?

23:00.880 --> 23:02.836
It's a red and a green wire.

23:03.007 --> 23:04.747
Go on. It ain't rocket science.

23:11.891 --> 23:14.553
Give it some gas.

23:19.899 --> 23:22.436
(engine starting )

23:25.238 --> 23:26.603
( whistles )

23:26.781 --> 23:28.567
( car door closes )

23:33.788 --> 23:35.619
Sasha and me picked that spot.

23:35.790 --> 23:37.997
He took you with us.

23:38.167 --> 23:40.658
There ain't no way
anybody could've known.

23:40.837 --> 23:43.294
You ain't gonna be standing alone,

23:43.464 --> 23:46.171
not no more. Let's go.

23:54.058 --> 23:56.390
(engine rewing)

24:02.150 --> 24:04.641
It's all expired
by at least a year.

24:04.819 --> 24:08.403
Better to take it.
Let Hershel decide what he needs.

24:12.285 --> 24:13.741
Did you think it was right?

24:13.911 --> 24:16.323
Letting those kids
come back with us?

24:16.497 --> 24:19.489
lthink it was
the humane thing to do.

24:19.667 --> 24:21.658
But did you think it was right?

24:23.421 --> 24:25.503
( drawer slides )

24:25.673 --> 24:27.709
Look at us.

24:27.884 --> 24:29.044
Digging through drawers,

24:29.218 --> 24:31.834
hoping that...
a couple of cough drops

24:32.013 --> 24:33.969
and some disinfectant
might be the difference

24:34.140 --> 24:36.677
between dying and living
a couple of more hours.

24:36.851 --> 24:38.352
(pills rattling)

24:38.519 --> 24:40.350
If they're strong enough
to help us survive this thing,

24:40.521 --> 24:42.728
yeah, I think you made
the right call.

24:42.899 --> 24:44.059
Rick:
And if they're not?

24:44.233 --> 24:46.519
Let's hope they are.

24:47.779 --> 24:49.861
( softly )
Yeah.

24:52.992 --> 24:54.778
Rick...

24:57.246 --> 25:01.535
I killed two people
and you haven't said a word about it.

25:03.211 --> 25:04.917
What do you want me to say?

25:05.088 --> 25:08.205
It's not about what you say.
It's about facing reality.

25:08.383 --> 25:11.090
It always comes for us
and over and over again

25:11.260 --> 25:12.545
we face it so that we can live.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.802
- So that we can live.
- That's right.

25:14.972 --> 25:17.224
That's what it always
comes down to.

25:17.392 --> 25:18.882
You can be a farmer, Rick.

25:19.060 --> 25:21.893
You can't just be a farmer.

25:30.154 --> 25:32.645
You're a good leader.

25:32.824 --> 25:36.066
Better than I probably
gave you credit for.

25:37.620 --> 25:39.326
I never murdered two of our own.

25:39.497 --> 25:41.704
Just one.

25:44.293 --> 25:46.670
He was gonna kill me.

25:46.838 --> 25:48.874
So were they.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.424
They were gonna kill all of us.

25:50.591 --> 25:52.752
You don't know that.

25:56.431 --> 25:58.422
If you thought it would
save Judith or Carl,

25:58.599 --> 26:00.885
would you have done it then or would you
have just gone back to your crops

26:01.060 --> 26:04.302
and hoped it'd all be okay?

26:04.480 --> 26:06.937
You don't have to like what I did, Rick.

26:07.108 --> 26:10.771
I don't.
You just accept it.

26:16.033 --> 26:18.695
(wind rustling)

26:18.870 --> 26:21.532
( distant can rattles )

26:22.957 --> 26:24.788
Daryl:
Looks like we're getting closer.

26:24.959 --> 26:27.325
Tyreese:
The building we want is just up ahead.

26:28.796 --> 26:31.629
( creaking )

26:36.679 --> 26:38.135
( softly )
Come on. Come on.

26:38.306 --> 26:40.092
Move, move.

26:41.309 --> 26:43.891
All right, let's make this quick

26:45.354 --> 26:47.310
There you go.

26:57.533 --> 26:59.649
Come on.

27:16.135 --> 27:18.626
Carol:
Let's hit the houses across the street.

27:18.805 --> 27:20.670
Hold on.

27:25.353 --> 27:27.639
How'd you put his
shoulder back before?

27:27.814 --> 27:29.179
You learn that from Hershel?

27:29.357 --> 27:32.019
Internet.

27:32.193 --> 27:33.979
It was easier than telling an ER nurse

27:34.153 --> 27:37.190
l'd fallen down the stairs a third time.

27:37.365 --> 27:39.105
I'm sorry.

27:39.283 --> 27:42.696
Don't be. Just fixed
what needed fixin'.

27:45.748 --> 27:49.206
I actually convinced myself
I was happy with him.

27:49.377 --> 27:50.583
Which wasn't all that hard to do,

27:50.753 --> 27:54.371
considering my idea of happiness then
was just not being alone.

27:54.549 --> 27:57.586
Made a decent living.

27:57.760 --> 27:59.546
He was charming
when he wanted to be,

27:59.720 --> 28:04.885
especially those mornings
after he'd come home piss-drunk and...

28:08.396 --> 28:12.560
Stupid. Stupid.

28:13.943 --> 28:16.901
I didn't think I could be strong.

28:17.071 --> 28:19.733
I didn't know I could.

28:19.907 --> 28:22.569
I already was.

28:24.787 --> 28:27.950
Why don't you say her name?

28:30.585 --> 28:32.621
She's dead, Rick.

28:32.795 --> 28:36.003
Sophia. Dead.

28:38.342 --> 28:40.879
Somebody else's slideshow.

28:47.560 --> 28:51.769
Some mornings I still wake up
half-expecting Lori to be there.

28:52.940 --> 28:56.273
Reminding me to pick up Carl
after school

28:56.444 --> 28:59.777
or telling me breakfast is ready.

29:02.283 --> 29:04.649
Every Sunday she'd make us
these pancakes

29:04.827 --> 29:08.536
that were just... godawful.

29:08.706 --> 29:09.946
(chuckling)

29:10.124 --> 29:13.537
Clumps of flour
that weren't mixed in right.

29:13.711 --> 29:15.793
Thing was...

29:15.963 --> 29:19.046
she knew it was bad.

29:19.216 --> 29:21.252
Why'd she keep at it?

29:22.845 --> 29:24.460
Well...

29:24.639 --> 29:28.928
she wanted us to be the kind of family
that ate pancakes on Sunday.

29:58.965 --> 30:00.626
( creaks )

30:07.848 --> 30:10.100
(grunting, munching)

30:12.103 --> 30:14.185
We should get back.

30:14.355 --> 30:16.892
Sam's probably waiting.

30:26.200 --> 30:26.313
Anything ending with -ci|lin or -cin,

30:26.325 --> 30:28.737
Anything ending with -ci|lin or -cin,

30:28.911 --> 30:30.776
C-l-N, grab it.

30:30.955 --> 30:35.039
We'll dissolve the pills in the IVs,
put 'em right into the bloodstream.

30:35.209 --> 30:38.793
Dosage will be tricky
but considering the time we lost...

30:42.258 --> 30:45.170
- How'd you do?
- Bags, tubes, clamps, connectors.

30:45.344 --> 30:47.209
- Everything on the list.
- What about y'all?

30:47.388 --> 30:49.549
Yeah, we got it all.

30:49.724 --> 30:52.431
Yeah. We're good.

30:52.601 --> 30:54.216
All right, let's roll.

31:12.830 --> 31:14.695
( softly )
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:17.001 --> 31:19.413
(snarling )

31:23.049 --> 31:24.630
Michonne:
Up ahead.

31:24.800 --> 31:27.883
(growling, snarling)

31:36.729 --> 31:39.596
( door creaks, shuts )

31:41.400 --> 31:43.140
Hey! Door's busted.

31:43.319 --> 31:45.355
Oh. Hold up.

31:46.405 --> 31:49.317
(walkers growling )

31:50.618 --> 31:54.327
(snarling )

31:58.793 --> 31:59.782
Michonne:
There.

32:11.847 --> 32:14.714
(snarling )

32:14.892 --> 32:17.304
(grunting)

32:22.358 --> 32:25.816
(snarling )

32:25.986 --> 32:27.396
- How many?
- I can't tell.

32:27.571 --> 32:28.560
(rumbling)

32:31.200 --> 32:33.657
- Tyreese: We can take 'em.
- Bob: No! They're infected.

32:33.828 --> 32:34.908
Same as at the prison.

32:35.079 --> 32:37.821
We fire at 'em, get their blood
on us, breathe it in.

32:37.998 --> 32:39.408
We didn't come all
this way to get sick.

32:39.583 --> 32:41.323
How do we know the ones in there
aren't any different?

32:41.502 --> 32:44.835
- We don't.
- Well, it's gotta change sometime.

32:48.717 --> 32:51.550
(snarling )

32:51.720 --> 32:54.177
-( blade rings)
- Daryl: Ready?

32:54.348 --> 32:55.849
Tyreese:
Do it!

32:56.016 --> 32:58.007
(growling, snarling)

32:58.185 --> 32:59.345
(grunts)

32:59.520 --> 33:01.556
(snarling )

33:06.527 --> 33:08.017
Daryl:
Come on.

33:09.738 --> 33:11.865
(snarling )

33:19.874 --> 33:22.536
(tapping )

33:30.551 --> 33:32.712
It's been too long.

33:34.180 --> 33:35.966
We should give him a couple more.

33:40.186 --> 33:42.177
He might be fine.

33:43.230 --> 33:45.312
He really might be.

33:48.569 --> 33:51.151
But it doesn't matter...

33:51.322 --> 33:55.440
because he's not here...
and we have to go.

34:05.461 --> 34:08.419
It was a nice watch.

34:15.930 --> 34:18.922
(snarling, growling)

34:19.099 --> 34:20.760
( snarls )

34:27.566 --> 34:28.726
- ( doorknob rattles )
- Back.

34:28.901 --> 34:30.311
Don't have an exit.

34:30.486 --> 34:31.896
Then we make one.

34:34.615 --> 34:36.196
Get down!
( grunts )

34:39.703 --> 34:41.614
- Come on, move it!
- Jump down to the walkway below.

34:41.789 --> 34:44.326
- Bob: They're here!
- Let's go! Go, go. Move.

34:52.508 --> 34:54.965
(snarling )

35:02.768 --> 35:06.101
Michonne:
Bob, let it go.

35:06.272 --> 35:07.557
Let it go, man.

35:07.731 --> 35:10.222
- ( grunting )
- Tyreese: Just let it go.

35:10.401 --> 35:13.017
- ( snarling, growling)
- Daryl: Let go of the bag, man.

35:16.824 --> 35:19.907
(snarling, growling)

35:27.251 --> 35:29.367
You got no meds in your bag?

35:29.545 --> 35:31.285
Just this?

35:34.425 --> 35:37.337
You should have kept
walking that day.

35:38.345 --> 35:39.755
Don't.

35:53.444 --> 35:56.151
(grunting)

35:58.365 --> 35:59.605
Just let it go, Daryl.

35:59.783 --> 36:01.614
The man's made his choice.

36:01.785 --> 36:03.491
Nothing you can do about it.

36:03.662 --> 36:06.495
Just gotta let it go.

36:06.665 --> 36:09.577
I didn't want to hurt nobody.

36:11.378 --> 36:14.370
It was just for when it gets quiet.

36:18.552 --> 36:20.133
Take one sip.

36:20.304 --> 36:23.341
When those meds get in our people,

36:23.515 --> 36:26.882
I will beat your ass into the ground.

36:27.061 --> 36:28.892
You hear me?

36:54.922 --> 36:57.584
( handle clicking )

36:58.926 --> 37:01.258
They might have lived.

37:03.847 --> 37:07.465
Karen and David,
they might have lived,

37:07.643 --> 37:09.929
and now they're dead.

37:10.104 --> 37:13.221
That wasn't your decision to make.

37:13.399 --> 37:16.766
When Tyreese finds out...

37:17.986 --> 37:19.977
...he'|| kill you.

37:20.155 --> 37:22.692
He damn near killed me over nothing.

37:22.866 --> 37:24.276
I can handle Tyreese.

37:24.451 --> 37:25.987
When the others find out,

37:26.161 --> 37:28.447
they won't want you there.

37:28.622 --> 37:31.159
And if they don't make it back,

37:31.333 --> 37:33.699
if everybody dies of this thing

37:33.877 --> 37:36.129
and it's just the two of us,

37:36.296 --> 37:41.006
with Judith and Carl--
with my children...

37:44.638 --> 37:47.596
I won't have you there.

37:47.766 --> 37:49.882
Rick, it's me.

37:51.895 --> 37:53.396
No one else has to know.

37:53.564 --> 37:56.101
I thought you were done making decisions
for everyone.

37:56.275 --> 37:59.733
I'm making this decision for me.

37:59.903 --> 38:04.146
I could have pretended
that everything was gonna be fine.

38:05.993 --> 38:08.109
But I didn't.

38:10.330 --> 38:13.618
I did something.
I stepped up.

38:13.792 --> 38:14.907
I had to do something.

38:15.085 --> 38:18.327
No, you didn't.

38:26.180 --> 38:28.717
If you think I'm going anywhere
without Lizzie and Mica--

38:28.891 --> 38:32.304
If you want them to leave,
to go out there with you?

38:32.478 --> 38:36.266
Lizzie's sick.
Mica is 10 years old.

38:36.440 --> 38:38.772
She can't.
( sniffles )

38:38.942 --> 38:41.354
We'll keep them safe.

38:46.617 --> 38:50.701
You're not that woman who was too scared
to be alone, not anymore.

38:50.871 --> 38:53.578
You're gonna start over,
find others,

38:53.749 --> 38:55.705
people who don't know,

38:55.876 --> 38:59.039
and you're gonna survive out here.

38:59.213 --> 39:01.829
You will.

39:04.384 --> 39:06.375
Maybe.

39:13.352 --> 39:16.810
Tyreese: That's where
lwas traveling, Highway 100.

39:16.980 --> 39:20.017
Michonne: Then it will take about
seven hours to get there.

39:20.192 --> 39:21.807
We're gonna need
more gas.

39:21.985 --> 39:23.850
Tyreese:
But we'll get there.

39:25.989 --> 39:28.651
- Taking Highway 100.
- I heard.

39:34.873 --> 39:36.374
( door closes)

39:41.004 --> 39:44.371
You were right,
what you said before.

39:44.550 --> 39:46.916
About the trail going cold.

39:49.805 --> 39:51.761
I don't need to go out anymore.

39:53.892 --> 39:55.598
Good.

39:58.146 --> 40:00.478
(engine starts)

40:12.703 --> 40:14.568
Take it.

40:26.174 --> 40:29.302
Ed gave this to me
on our first anniversary.

40:33.265 --> 40:35.551
Please.

40:41.440 --> 40:44.773
I should have given it away
a long time ago.

40:49.990 --> 40:52.697
(engine starting )

41:05.881 --> 41:09.999
J‘ It was a close call J‘

41:10.177 --> 41:13.135
J‘ Sitting in the back of the room J‘

41:13.305 --> 41:17.014
J‘ With a ball I had thrown at you J‘

41:24.524 --> 41:27.357
J‘ Close in on my black eye J‘

41:27.527 --> 41:32.897
J‘ | feel safe at times J‘

41:33.075 --> 41:37.034
J‘ Certain emblems J‘

41:37.204 --> 41:40.913
J‘ Tell me it's time J‘

41:43.710 --> 41:46.873
J‘ Serpents in my mind J‘

41:50.008 --> 41:53.876
J‘ Looking for your J‘

41:54.054 --> 41:56.215
J‘ Crimes J‘

41:56.390 --> 42:00.474
J‘ Everything changes J‘

42:02.896 --> 42:06.229
J‘ I don't want mine J‘

42:06.400 --> 42:12.066
J‘ This time J‘

42:12.239 --> 42:16.528
J‘ Everything changes. J‘
