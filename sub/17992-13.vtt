00:02.268 --> 00:04.371
{\an8}Announcer: This is "Love and
Hip Hop: Hollywood" the reunion.

00:04.437 --> 00:07.207
You know, sleep with
each other's boyfriends.

00:07.273 --> 00:08.641
But you ---- Ray though.

00:08.708 --> 00:09.442
You started.

00:09.509 --> 00:10.877
You're ---- right.

00:10.943 --> 00:12.645
You never know what to expect.

00:12.712 --> 00:13.913
What's up, big ass ho.

00:13.980 --> 00:14.814
You're a prostitute.

00:14.881 --> 00:15.715
Choke on that, ho.

00:15.782 --> 00:16.649
I'm a prostitute?

00:16.716 --> 00:18.318
Who's ---- was you
choking on last week?

00:18.385 --> 00:19.819
Hold up, hold up.

00:19.886 --> 00:21.888
Announcer: When
secrets are revealed.

00:21.955 --> 00:23.189
Teairra gave ----.

00:23.256 --> 00:24.824
He's a fraud ass bitch ass.

00:24.891 --> 00:26.960
Swear to God on
my life right now.

00:27.026 --> 00:28.161
Swear.

00:28.228 --> 00:31.765
If you ain't ----, why
you getting off the couch?

00:31.831 --> 00:33.967
Control your hos,
Berg, control your hos.

00:34.033 --> 00:34.734
You're the one who told
me she was an escort.

00:34.801 --> 00:36.636
Don't ---- address me.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.605
Bitch, ---- ----.

00:38.671 --> 00:41.174
Sit the ---- down.

00:41.241 --> 00:43.042
Announcer: Things spin out
of control when the cast of

00:43.109 --> 00:47.781
Hollywood is reunited on
stage for the very first time.

00:47.847 --> 00:49.649
There's some foul ----
going on and I don't like that.

00:49.716 --> 00:51.918
It's nobody's business for one.

00:51.985 --> 00:53.920
How is it nobody's business, but
it's public information and the

00:53.987 --> 00:55.455
whole ---- internet know,
but I don't know.

00:55.522 --> 00:57.557
I'm high, I'm
drunk, I want to ----.

00:57.624 --> 00:59.993
He cashed out because
the ---- is so little,

01:00.059 --> 01:01.461
he can't do nothing ---- else.

01:01.528 --> 01:02.462
Well, I'll pull it out.

01:02.529 --> 01:04.431
Omari, stop.

01:04.497 --> 01:06.633
Where was the love, Jesus?

01:06.699 --> 01:07.634
We broke up.

01:07.700 --> 01:09.436
We broke up because I left you.

01:09.502 --> 01:12.806
I'm beautiful, I'm
gorgeous and I'm funny as ----.

01:12.872 --> 01:15.442
Announcer: And the
insults run deep.

01:15.508 --> 01:17.177
I'm going to show you what
a masterpiece looks like.

01:17.243 --> 01:18.978
I have heels higher than
your self esteem, so sit down.

01:19.045 --> 01:20.680
I know you should
shut the ---- up.

01:20.747 --> 01:22.182
My mug shot looks
better than your work.

01:22.248 --> 01:24.651
You're a petty ass thief.

01:24.717 --> 01:26.820
Only thing I stole was your
---- and I didn't even wear 'em.

01:26.886 --> 01:29.189
Kiss my ass all day long, bitch.

01:29.255 --> 01:30.924
Announcer:
Nothing is left sacred.

01:30.990 --> 01:31.958
I mean, she gave me some ----.

01:32.025 --> 01:34.060
You gave me all the
---- in the world.

01:34.127 --> 01:35.862
You gave me more ----
than your bald head.

01:35.929 --> 01:36.896
Shut the ---- up.

01:36.963 --> 01:38.131
Like I told you before,

01:38.198 --> 01:40.066
I've been waiting to ----
you up, bitch.

01:40.133 --> 01:43.069
Announcer: But tonight
on part one of the reunion,

01:43.136 --> 01:45.672
they came to finish
what they started.

01:45.738 --> 01:47.540
You want to talk about you
smashing Yung Berg

01:47.607 --> 01:48.675
and dancing that?

01:48.741 --> 01:49.909
No, that's my man.

01:49.976 --> 01:52.445
Oh, really, that's your man
after you ---- my man, right?

01:52.512 --> 01:54.247
Why would you ---- here?

01:54.314 --> 01:57.116
Announcer: And the
heat gets turned up.

01:57.183 --> 01:58.551
Keep my name out of your mouth.

01:58.618 --> 02:00.053
I'm speaking for real though.

02:00.119 --> 02:02.856
Listen, Uncle Fester, keep my
---- name out of your mouth.

02:02.922 --> 02:03.523
When I see you.

02:03.590 --> 02:05.291
You're right here.

02:05.358 --> 02:06.459
I'll beat that little ---- ass.

02:06.526 --> 02:07.627
One of y'all want to fight?

02:07.694 --> 02:08.862
Let's get down.

02:08.928 --> 02:09.795
You ain't my boss.

02:09.863 --> 02:11.030
You worked for me though.

02:11.097 --> 02:12.632
No, I didn't work for you,
keep it real,

02:12.699 --> 02:13.766
can you shut the ---- up?

02:13.833 --> 02:16.469
Can you please go
knock her out real quick?

02:16.536 --> 02:23.109
Announcer: This is "Love and Hip
Hop: Hollywood", the reunion.

02:26.079 --> 02:28.948
{\an5}Welcome to "Love and Hip
Hop: Hollywood", the reunion.

02:29.015 --> 02:31.150
{\an5}I'm your host Mona Scott-Young.

02:31.217 --> 02:34.254
{\an5}When we settled in Hollywood
we quickly found out how wild

02:34.320 --> 02:36.556
things can get in the west.

02:36.623 --> 02:40.860
One couple embraced new life,
while another suffered a loss.

02:40.927 --> 02:44.297
We saw what was inside one
woman's heart, but we also saw

02:44.364 --> 02:46.065
what was inside her bag.

02:46.132 --> 02:49.435
A few ladies made the right
connections while others just

02:49.502 --> 02:51.571
connected with their right.

02:51.638 --> 02:55.575
There was fallout, or should
I say fall in by the pool.

02:55.642 --> 02:58.845
But as they say in
Hollywood, the show must go on.

02:58.912 --> 03:01.114
Tonight everyone is back
together for their very

03:01.180 --> 03:03.716
first reunion show.

03:03.783 --> 03:06.986
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome the cast of

03:07.053 --> 03:09.155
"Love and Hip Hop: Hollywood".

03:09.222 --> 03:23.870
[cheers and applause]

03:23.937 --> 03:25.939
The interesting
thing that we found about

03:26.005 --> 03:28.207
"Love and Hip Hop:
Hollywood" is that this

03:28.274 --> 03:31.444
cast is very connected.

03:31.511 --> 03:34.981
I mean, there was a lot of
relationship swapping,

03:35.048 --> 03:37.750
is it fair to say?

03:37.817 --> 03:41.421
I'm just trying to say when we
came out here to cast, that was

03:41.487 --> 03:44.157
the singular most interesting
aspect because as I was

03:44.223 --> 03:46.759
speaking to everyone, they
had all hooked up.

03:46.826 --> 03:49.195
There was actually this little
graph chart that we were able to

03:49.262 --> 03:52.765
make that connect
every single person.

03:52.832 --> 03:54.434
Let me ask Hazel this question.

03:54.500 --> 03:57.604
With the men feeling like it's
okay, what's the vibe for women?

03:57.670 --> 03:59.772
I mean, is there a different
perception in Hollywood for

03:59.839 --> 04:02.475
women who engage is
pretty much the same activity?

04:02.542 --> 04:06.512
{\an5}I mean, I just feel like there's
certain codes, like you don't

04:06.579 --> 04:09.048
sleep with each
other's ex-boyfriend.

04:09.115 --> 04:10.350
{\an8}But you ---- Ray though.

04:10.416 --> 04:11.384
{\an8}You ---- Ray.

04:11.451 --> 04:13.853
{\an8}Oh, oh, oh, oh.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.455
Why?

04:15.521 --> 04:17.055
She did though.

04:17.123 --> 04:18.690
You starting this already?

04:18.757 --> 04:19.659
---- right.

04:19.726 --> 04:20.593
The DaVinci Code.

04:20.660 --> 04:21.861
Hold on a second.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.463
Hold on a second.

04:23.529 --> 04:24.797
Ray, Ray, Ray, Ray, Ray, Ray.

04:24.864 --> 04:25.865
Let me just ask Hazel.

04:25.932 --> 04:29.936
Have you guys hooked up?

04:30.003 --> 04:34.641
He hit it first in
Hollywood when I was in college.

04:34.707 --> 04:36.809
And Teairra knew
that at the beginning.

04:36.876 --> 04:38.544
You knew that?

04:38.611 --> 04:39.445
She knew.

04:39.512 --> 04:41.047
This is exactly the
point I'm making.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.316
You hit it first, boy, oh ----.

04:43.383 --> 04:46.552
Ray J, you seem very
disturbed by all of this.

04:46.619 --> 04:47.954
Are you okay?

04:48.021 --> 04:52.325
I'm just trying to
have a good time.

04:52.392 --> 04:55.094
All right, well, we're going
to get more into all of these

04:55.161 --> 04:59.766
stories, but right now I want to
focus on Teairra Mari and Ray J.

04:59.832 --> 05:02.035
When we began the season,
the door was shut

05:02.101 --> 05:04.003
on their relationship.

05:04.070 --> 05:07.306
And although Teairra was able to
remove his name from her skin,

05:07.373 --> 05:09.842
he still managed
to get under it.

05:09.909 --> 05:12.145
Let's take a look.

05:12.211 --> 05:16.849
Every woman has that one that
she loves and will do anything

05:16.916 --> 05:19.419
for and will always go back to.

05:19.485 --> 05:21.587
Ray J is that one for me.

05:21.654 --> 05:24.323
{\an8}You left me for somebody else.

05:24.390 --> 05:25.792
{\an8}I felt like we was
headed for destruction.

05:25.858 --> 05:27.694
{\an8}All right, Ray, so if
you're happy where you are?

05:27.760 --> 05:29.595
{\an8}Yeah, I'm happy, are you happy?

05:29.662 --> 05:30.930
{\an8}No.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.999
{\an8}I haven't been
happy since you left.

05:33.066 --> 05:34.701
{\an8}T.

05:34.767 --> 05:36.235
{\an8}Leave me alone.

05:36.302 --> 05:38.471
{\an8}You're telling me how happy you
are and I haven't talked to you

05:38.538 --> 05:40.673
{\an8}in I don't know how long.

05:40.740 --> 05:42.709
{\an8}How the ---- do you
think that makes me feel?

05:42.775 --> 05:44.577
{\an8}I'm not saying it to
make you feel bad.

05:44.644 --> 05:45.411
{\an8}It's fine.

05:45.478 --> 05:46.412
{\an8}It's fine.

05:46.479 --> 05:47.647
Let's be friends.

05:47.714 --> 05:49.215
I'm doing this RayJ.com party.

05:49.282 --> 05:52.118
You're more than welcome
to come with your friend.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.653
The last time that I talked to
you you told me that your

05:53.720 --> 05:55.521
girl threw my ---- away.

05:55.588 --> 06:00.193
So, I just want to say
that a check needs to be cut.

06:00.259 --> 06:02.528
{\an8}Monistat, BV capsules,
were those in the bag?

06:02.595 --> 06:03.496
{\an8}What about it?

06:03.563 --> 06:04.964
{\an8}Bitch.

06:05.031 --> 06:07.100
{\an8}Don't ever call
me like that, ho.

06:07.166 --> 06:08.501
{\an8}What you doing?

06:08.568 --> 06:11.537
{\an8}Oh, really?

06:11.604 --> 06:13.272
{\an8}Whatever the ---- you
had in the bag, I got it.

06:13.339 --> 06:14.407
{\an8}It's right there.

06:14.474 --> 06:16.809
{\an8}I'm tripping.

06:16.876 --> 06:18.044
Still think about him every day?

06:18.111 --> 06:19.178
Why are you doing this?

06:19.245 --> 06:20.246
I'm just saying because I know.

06:20.313 --> 06:21.581
Let's just keep it real.

06:21.647 --> 06:25.084
If you want him, go get him.

06:25.151 --> 06:25.985
What's up?

06:26.052 --> 06:27.887
I wanted to apologize.

06:27.954 --> 06:30.490
All right, so you went in the
party and you did what you did.

06:30.556 --> 06:32.458
{\an8}And I feel like I'm
owed an apology too.

06:32.525 --> 06:34.660
{\an8}Well, you're never
going to get it.

06:34.727 --> 06:36.095
{\an8}It's okay, babe.

06:36.162 --> 06:40.433
{\an8}Have a good life.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.468
♪ I never should
have did that. ♪

06:42.535 --> 06:43.970
[applause]

06:44.036 --> 06:44.904
You're an asshole.

06:44.971 --> 06:48.374
You're an asshole.

06:48.441 --> 06:49.075
I'm an asshole too.

06:49.142 --> 06:49.876
Hold on to that thought.

06:49.942 --> 06:50.777
Let's go back a little bit.

06:50.843 --> 06:52.178
There was a lot of
confusion, I think.

06:52.245 --> 06:55.181
There was a timeline
of your relationship.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.617
You said you guys were
together for eight years.

06:57.683 --> 06:58.751
Off and on.

06:58.818 --> 07:00.353
{\an5}So, tell us a little about that.

07:00.419 --> 07:03.689
{\an5}But he said I was delusional, so
why would I backtrack into that?

07:03.756 --> 07:05.324
No, Teairra, you
wasn't delusional.

07:05.391 --> 07:06.759
You wasn't.

07:06.826 --> 07:07.894
That's what you said.

07:07.960 --> 07:09.495
I was upset with you.

07:09.562 --> 07:11.864
Okay, you hurt
people, is that okay?

07:11.931 --> 07:13.065
No, it wasn't.

07:13.132 --> 07:17.537
I'm so sorry I humiliated
you and I really genuinely am.

07:17.603 --> 07:18.805
I'll never do that to you again.

07:18.871 --> 07:19.705
Well, thank you.

07:19.772 --> 07:20.773
I appreciate that.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.008
You know what I'm
saying, for real.

07:22.074 --> 07:23.309
Okay.

07:23.376 --> 07:25.311
[applause]

07:25.378 --> 07:26.212
So, we good?

07:26.279 --> 07:27.013
Yes.

07:27.079 --> 07:28.548
Okay.

07:28.614 --> 07:30.183
He seems like
he's being sincere.

07:30.249 --> 07:31.450
I'm sorry.

07:31.517 --> 07:33.619
And I don't want her going about
thinking I didn't feel a certain

07:33.686 --> 07:35.621
way and I didn't feel
bad about what I did.

07:35.688 --> 07:37.290
I know you're sorry.

07:37.356 --> 07:38.591
{\an5}Because I did.

07:38.658 --> 07:41.928
{\an5}And watching it back,
I really feel terrible.

07:41.994 --> 07:44.730
I didn't like myself.

07:44.797 --> 07:45.932
Okay.

07:45.998 --> 07:47.033
Are you good?

07:47.099 --> 07:48.734
All right, we heard a
lot about that box.

07:48.801 --> 07:51.103
That box was its
own trending topic.

07:51.170 --> 07:52.438
Yes.

07:52.505 --> 07:54.540
And what was
missing from the box?

07:54.607 --> 07:56.442
You kept talking about a
check needed to be cut.

07:56.509 --> 07:57.443
Absolutely.

07:57.510 --> 07:59.145
For one it's Louis Vuitton.

07:59.212 --> 08:01.547
She knows, she was there.

08:01.614 --> 08:03.616
I didn't know where the
other Louis Vuitton was.

08:03.683 --> 08:06.118
Well, you said a
check needed to be cut.

08:06.185 --> 08:11.357
And from what we saw in the box
there was some vaginal products.

08:11.424 --> 08:12.892
But you didn't see
that in the box.

08:12.959 --> 08:15.695
You saw that in the picture that
this bitch ass bitch put up.

08:15.761 --> 08:16.796
Ooh.

08:16.863 --> 08:18.331
Listen, and all that was wrong.

08:18.397 --> 08:21.234
Well, we know there was one
person who seemed to know

08:21.300 --> 08:23.369
exactly what was
in Teairra's bag.

08:23.436 --> 08:26.339
Please help us welcome
Princess to the stage.

08:26.405 --> 08:31.544
[applause]

08:31.611 --> 08:33.446
What's up, fake ass ho?

08:33.511 --> 08:34.280
You talking about yourself?

08:34.347 --> 08:38.049
You're the only ho on the stage?

08:38.116 --> 08:40.385
Well, the last time, Princess,
we saw your relationship with

08:40.453 --> 08:43.589
Ray, you guys weren't
in a great space, right?

08:43.655 --> 08:45.558
What's been going on since?

08:45.625 --> 08:46.993
Well, we've been working it out.

08:47.059 --> 08:49.428
Things happened.

08:49.495 --> 08:52.732
We broke up for two
weeks, but we're good now.

08:52.798 --> 08:55.401
{\an5}We love each other and
that's all that matters.

08:55.468 --> 08:57.203
Well, we know Ray J
has a reputation for

08:57.270 --> 08:59.705
swimming in women.

08:59.772 --> 09:02.608
So, when the relationship
between Ray and Princess

09:02.675 --> 09:05.811
started to go under,
Princess found out just

09:05.878 --> 09:08.214
how deep Ray's love really was.

09:08.281 --> 09:10.182
Let's take a look.

09:10.249 --> 09:11.450
You know, me and Princess,
we connected on a

09:11.517 --> 09:12.718
whole other level.

09:12.785 --> 09:14.720
I've been with her for two
years and we just vibbed,

09:14.787 --> 09:16.422
it just worked.

09:16.489 --> 09:18.624
Where do you see
us going from here?

09:18.691 --> 09:19.792
We're going to
have kids together,

09:19.859 --> 09:22.962
we're going to get married.

09:23.029 --> 09:24.196
{\an8}How's Princess?

09:24.263 --> 09:25.865
{\an8}I love Princess.

09:25.932 --> 09:28.034
{\an8}We gotta work out some things
in our own relationship,

09:28.100 --> 09:30.102
{\an8}but I love Princess.

09:30.169 --> 09:31.837
{\an8}And then it's like
with this Teairra girl,

09:31.904 --> 09:34.340
{\an8}she just won't let go.

09:34.407 --> 09:37.376
I would never sit up and lay in
the bed with you and then tell

09:37.443 --> 09:41.514
somebody everything that
we had pillow talk about.

09:41.580 --> 09:42.982
{\an8}I know everything
that's been said.

09:43.049 --> 09:43.983
{\an8}How do you know?

09:44.050 --> 09:45.117
{\an8}Because your girl tells me.

09:45.184 --> 09:48.387
{\an8}All the women in your
life, from Princess to Morgan.

09:48.454 --> 09:51.057
{\an8}All of them are
talking to all of them.

09:51.123 --> 09:55.461
{\an8}What Princess is allowing is
going to break you guys

09:55.528 --> 09:58.331
{\an8}apart and it's going to be
a public shenanigan.

09:58.397 --> 10:00.666
{\an8}How the ---- does Morgan know
all this ---- about me

10:00.733 --> 10:02.601
{\an8}and my girlfriend?

10:02.668 --> 10:04.704
{\an8}When I was talking to Teairra
I didn't even want to say

10:04.770 --> 10:06.372
{\an8}she was right.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.807
{\an8}You want to say Teairra's right?

10:07.873 --> 10:08.808
{\an8}Seriously?

10:08.874 --> 10:09.875
{\an8}Floyd was right.

10:09.942 --> 10:15.881
{\an8}Maybe it's time for me
and you to just separate.

10:15.948 --> 10:18.851
{\an8}Stop, stop, stop, stop.

10:18.918 --> 10:19.685
{\an8}What'd I tell you?

10:19.752 --> 10:20.486
{\an8}Stop.

10:20.553 --> 10:21.153
{\an8}You're a bitch.

10:21.220 --> 10:21.954
{\an8}You're a bitch.

10:22.021 --> 10:23.589
{\an8}Stop.

10:23.656 --> 10:24.690
{\an8}Stop.

10:24.757 --> 10:25.958
{\an8}Sorry.

10:26.025 --> 10:27.059
{\an8}Stop.

10:27.126 --> 10:28.094
{\an8}I'm out.

10:28.160 --> 10:29.195
{\an8}You was right.

10:29.261 --> 10:30.930
{\an8}You don't have to
say anything else.

10:30.997 --> 10:31.797
{\an8}I love you.

10:31.864 --> 10:33.032
{\an8}I miss you.

10:33.099 --> 10:35.735
{\an8}[kissing noises]

10:35.801 --> 10:38.371
{\an8}I always felt that Ray
would come back to me.

10:38.437 --> 10:41.040
{\an8}The passion was
always there between us.

10:41.107 --> 10:44.610
[applause]

10:44.677 --> 10:45.711
That was cute.

10:45.778 --> 10:46.912
That was cute.

10:46.979 --> 10:48.047
Very cute.

10:48.114 --> 10:50.649
You don't seem very
surprised, Princess.

10:50.716 --> 10:53.886
Did you know that Ray J and
Teairra had kind of reconnected?

10:53.953 --> 10:55.321
Yeah, he told me.

10:55.388 --> 10:56.655
Yeah, I told her what happened
because she was going to

10:56.722 --> 10:58.157
see it anyway.

10:58.224 --> 11:01.394
When you guys reconnected,
what exactly happened between

11:01.460 --> 11:03.129
you and Ray?

11:03.195 --> 11:04.497
[laughs]

11:04.563 --> 11:06.065
Nothing.

11:06.132 --> 11:07.166
Enough.

11:07.233 --> 11:09.135
Not much, he's
right here with me.

11:09.201 --> 11:10.336
And that's okay, bitch.

11:10.403 --> 11:12.671
You're a prostitute,
choke on a ----, ho.

11:12.738 --> 11:13.472
I'm a prostitute?

11:13.539 --> 11:14.407
Yeah.

11:14.473 --> 11:15.174
Whose ---- was you
choking on last week?

11:15.241 --> 11:15.908
Bitch.

11:15.975 --> 11:18.377
In a back alley.

11:18.444 --> 11:19.678
Bitch, I wan't
choking on nobody's ----.

11:19.745 --> 11:24.483
Berg, wasn't she choking on
your ---- in a back alley?

11:24.550 --> 11:25.484
Is that true?

11:25.551 --> 11:26.552
Hey, hold on.

11:26.619 --> 11:27.686
No, that's not right, bitch.

11:27.753 --> 11:29.155
You don't even know what
the ---- you're talking about.

11:29.221 --> 11:31.891
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

11:31.957 --> 11:33.559
Hold on.

11:33.626 --> 11:35.728
You are not doing that.

11:35.795 --> 11:37.163
You better keep it cute,
because you don't know me.

11:37.229 --> 11:38.964
Bitch, I'm not going to keep it
cute because you're got on the

11:39.031 --> 11:40.766
rhinestones, you got on
the rhinestones, bitch.

11:40.833 --> 11:43.102
You don't know me, bitch.

11:43.169 --> 11:44.537
What'd I tell you?

11:44.603 --> 11:46.305
I'll pull that wig off, ho.

11:46.372 --> 11:47.606
{\an8}Pull it off.

11:47.673 --> 11:49.008
{\an8}Come on and pull it off.

11:49.075 --> 11:50.042
{\an8}Please, come on.

11:50.109 --> 11:51.143
{\an8}None of that is happening.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.044
{\an8}I wish you would.

11:52.111 --> 11:53.579
{\an8}I wish you would.

11:53.646 --> 11:55.681
{\an8}Nobody's going to
be taking off wigs.

11:55.748 --> 12:00.386
♪♪

12:02.588 --> 12:04.190
Hold on, hold on.

12:04.256 --> 12:04.957
Bitch.

12:05.024 --> 12:06.125
You gotta calm down.

12:06.192 --> 12:07.026
What'd I tell you?

12:07.093 --> 12:07.860
Ray, Ray, Ray, Ray.

12:07.927 --> 12:09.161
Give me that bag.

12:09.228 --> 12:10.029
I don't lie.

12:10.096 --> 12:11.030
Yeah, I will, bitch.

12:11.097 --> 12:12.398
I will.

12:12.465 --> 12:13.299
I'll pull that wig off, ho.

12:13.365 --> 12:14.033
Shut the ---- up.

12:14.100 --> 12:14.767
Pull it off.

12:14.834 --> 12:15.701
Come on and pull it off.

12:15.768 --> 12:18.003
Listen, none of
that is happening.

12:18.070 --> 12:18.971
I wish you would.

12:19.038 --> 12:20.539
I wish you ---- would.

12:20.606 --> 12:22.708
Bitch, you got on
rhinestones, ho.

12:22.775 --> 12:24.677
Bitch, you got on rhinestones.

12:24.743 --> 12:25.478
No, I don't.

12:25.544 --> 12:26.712
You fake ass.

12:26.779 --> 12:28.914
All right,
Teairra's out of control.

12:28.981 --> 12:31.016
If I cannot reel you back in.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.451
Well, tell her to
shut the ---- up.

12:32.518 --> 12:35.721
I thought I was about to
get hit with the whole thing.

12:35.788 --> 12:38.524
I thought she got a
knife or something.

12:38.591 --> 12:39.859
Now you're going to have to be
babysat by security because

12:39.925 --> 12:42.128
I can't trust you to not get up.

12:42.194 --> 12:43.696
Princess, you good?

12:43.762 --> 12:44.630
I'm great.

12:44.697 --> 12:46.132
All right.

12:46.198 --> 12:47.366
Teairra, let me ask you this.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.735
{\an5}Why did you say that Ray
wasn't happy with Princess?

12:49.802 --> 12:52.938
Because she was telling
all his business to Morgan.

12:53.005 --> 12:53.973
{\an5}But did I tell you?

12:54.039 --> 12:55.107
{\an5}No, it was on the streets.

12:55.174 --> 12:56.075
Thank you.

12:56.142 --> 12:57.209
She has a big ass mouth.

12:57.276 --> 12:58.277
Somebody else told you.

12:58.344 --> 12:59.678
Teairra, stop lying.

12:59.745 --> 13:00.913
{\an8}You told me she
told you everything.

13:00.980 --> 13:01.814
I never told you that.

13:01.881 --> 13:02.882
I never told you that.

13:02.948 --> 13:04.116
Don't lie.

13:04.183 --> 13:05.151
My mother, rest in peace, I
never told her ---- about y'all.

13:05.217 --> 13:06.952
I never told you that.

13:07.019 --> 13:08.320
Don't lie.

13:08.387 --> 13:09.288
You know I don't lie about ----.

13:09.355 --> 13:10.523
Ray, Ray, let me say this.

13:10.589 --> 13:13.125
I don't lie on my ----
and I don't lie about ----.

13:13.192 --> 13:14.160
We're going to get into this.

13:14.226 --> 13:15.594
Princess, let me ask you this.

13:15.661 --> 13:17.630
On a much lighter note you look
like you were trying to push

13:17.696 --> 13:18.731
Ray into the pool.

13:18.797 --> 13:19.698
I did.

13:19.765 --> 13:21.534
But then you ended up
going into the pool.

13:21.600 --> 13:22.735
Yeah.

13:22.801 --> 13:25.171
I used to play football,
so I stutter stepped back.

13:25.237 --> 13:27.006
[laughter]

13:27.072 --> 13:28.641
I mean, but Ray,
it's so messed up.

13:28.707 --> 13:29.942
You helped her into the
pool, at least you could

13:30.009 --> 13:31.310
have helped her out.

13:31.377 --> 13:32.378
I ran.

13:32.444 --> 13:34.480
She was coming for me.

13:34.547 --> 13:35.748
I wasn't going to touch you.

13:35.814 --> 13:36.849
But still I was running for my
life because I didn't know what

13:36.916 --> 13:38.284
was going to happen.

13:38.350 --> 13:42.354
All of the sudden she came
for me, I Bo Jacksoned her.

13:42.421 --> 13:45.457
And I love her, but
that's what happened.

13:45.524 --> 13:48.460
Princess, what was it that
he said that pissed you off?

13:48.527 --> 13:52.164
We were talking about Morgan and
he just brought up Teairra and

13:52.231 --> 13:55.100
{\an5}so I just was like, "What does
she have to do with anything

13:55.167 --> 13:56.702
we were talking about?"

13:56.769 --> 13:58.938
And I felt like he was doing
that because he was trying

13:59.004 --> 14:01.307
to get a reaction out of me.

14:01.373 --> 14:03.876
But you brought up
Floyd in the conversation.

14:03.943 --> 14:04.843
After that.

14:04.910 --> 14:06.645
I don't care about Floyd.

14:06.712 --> 14:08.714
He brought up Teairra,
so I brought up my ex,

14:08.781 --> 14:10.049
you know what I mean?

14:10.115 --> 14:13.719
Teairra, you mentioned to
Ray that Princess was still

14:13.786 --> 14:16.255
in communication with
Floyd when Ray was in jail.

14:16.322 --> 14:17.723
Is that the case?

14:17.790 --> 14:19.625
{\an8}I was upset because I felt like
Princess had threw me

14:19.692 --> 14:21.060
{\an8}under the bus?

14:21.126 --> 14:22.394
Is that what that was?

14:22.461 --> 14:24.096
You thought that everything that
Ray was saying to you came

14:24.163 --> 14:25.064
from Morgan?

14:25.130 --> 14:26.565
No, that's not how it happened.

14:26.632 --> 14:30.302
What happened was, what happened
was, everybody has that one

14:30.369 --> 14:35.207
person that they vent to.

14:35.274 --> 14:36.275
Finish, babe.

14:36.342 --> 14:37.476
You're about to get upset.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.712
Don't, just let it out,
if you gotta cry, cry.

14:39.778 --> 14:43.482
Just do it real quick.

14:43.549 --> 14:46.485
Wait, Princess, hold onto it
because thanks to Ray J,

14:46.552 --> 14:48.153
I think the moment has passed.

14:48.220 --> 14:51.257
How do you feel about the
period when you and Ray,

14:51.323 --> 14:53.092
after the pool where you
guys were separated.

14:53.158 --> 14:56.495
And Ray and Teairra reconnected,
what do you think about that?

14:56.562 --> 14:58.764
I felt like it was my fault.

14:58.831 --> 15:00.432
And I felt like if it was
genuine, it would have

15:00.499 --> 15:02.601
happened a long time ago.

15:02.668 --> 15:05.938
And I just felt like he was
vulnerable and you know,

15:06.005 --> 15:07.573
I did some stuff.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.508
I wasn't vulnerable,
I was mad as a ----.

15:09.575 --> 15:12.144
But as far as me and Teairra, I
had to make sure I connected

15:12.211 --> 15:13.712
the dots with.

15:13.779 --> 15:15.714
And I would rather you do
that when we're not together.

15:15.781 --> 15:20.219
All right, Morgan, you've
been around both couples, right.

15:20.286 --> 15:23.689
There's Ray with
Princess and Ray with Teairra.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.058
Who, from your perspective,
would you say is

15:26.125 --> 15:27.526
a stronger couple?

15:27.593 --> 15:29.628
Who do you think makes
more sense with Ray J?

15:29.695 --> 15:31.163
Tell the truth, Morgan.

15:31.230 --> 15:34.199
I would say their bond was
stronger, Ray's and Princess.

15:34.266 --> 15:35.434
Uh huh.

15:35.501 --> 15:37.903
But I would say that I've never
seen him the way he is with

15:37.970 --> 15:40.072
Princess with anybody
else, I've never seen that.

15:40.139 --> 15:41.440
That's the honest truth.

15:41.507 --> 15:42.875
So, when he's with Teairra
it's a different Ray J

15:42.941 --> 15:44.076
that you see now.

15:44.143 --> 15:45.377
He's older now.

15:45.444 --> 15:48.580
And he was a one-woman man
while he was with Princess.

15:48.647 --> 15:50.649
With all of that said,
where do you and Ray stand now?

15:50.716 --> 15:52.451

death, unconditionally.

be with Teairra, #raytt.

relationship with Hazel.

21:38.797 --> 21:40.399
Let me hear your thoughts on it.

21:40.465 --> 21:42.501
As far as her and Berg

{\an8}that wasn't the case.

21:44.503 --> 21:46.872
When he was hanging out with her
a lot more, that was a little

21:48.740 --> 21:50.342
Why is that though?

21:50.409 --> 21:52.844

She is a beautiful girl.

22:02.087 --> 22:03.088
She's very pretty.

When you're saying they're

22:03.989 --> 22:05.323
she's a beautiful woman.

22:05.390 --> 22:06.725
Older than Yung.

22:06.792 --> 22:07.826
I'm just four
years older than him.

22:07.893 --> 22:10.996
He's not in a
serious space right now.

22:11.063 --> 22:13.198

---- is so little he can't do

22:38.757 --> 22:42.894

22:42.961 --> 22:46.765

22:46.832 --> 22:52.003

22:52.070 --> 22:53.672
Can you just have my
back on one thing?

22:53.739 --> 22:55.907
You definitely said that, but
Hazel, at the end of the day,

22:55.974 --> 22:58.877

23:04.382 --> 23:07.986

got fun size, that means that it

23:08.053 --> 23:11.123
{\an5}feels good and you
can have fun with it.

23:11.189 --> 23:14.593

the bite size bags of candy.

23:14.659 --> 23:16.628

23:16.695 --> 23:17.896

23:33.211 --> 23:34.112
So, what was it?

23:34.179 --> 23:35.914
What was it?

23:35.981 --> 23:39.251
The fact that I've known
Berg since 2006, since I was

23:39.317 --> 23:41.119
a publicist, we were friends.

23:41.186 --> 23:43.255
When he moved in his
first house, I was there.

23:43.321 --> 23:46.458
When I wanted to get help on my
music and he came back around,

23:46.525 --> 23:47.359
he was there.

23:47.425 --> 23:48.727
Over a course of years.

23:48.794 --> 23:50.428
It wasn't I was chasing
Berg for eight years.

23:50.495 --> 23:52.664

and got back cool.

31:47.905 --> 31:49.340
{\an8}How is he a liar?

31:49.407 --> 31:51.809
{\an8}----, ----.

31:51.876 --> 31:56.748
{\an8}Don't ----, I'll
---- you, bitch.

31:56.814 --> 31:58.049
You said he said he
loved you, right?

31:58.116 --> 31:59.183
We both did.

31:59.250 --> 32:00.718
Did you not think that
relationship was a little phony

32:00.785 --> 32:02.387
because of the one month period?

32:02.453 --> 32:04.088
The only reason I even said
it was was because my hair

32:04.155 --> 32:05.556
was being pulled.

32:05.623 --> 32:08.026
Every man has their thing
that they do when they have sex.

32:08.092 --> 32:11.562
Mally in particular loves
to pull this long ass hair.

32:11.629 --> 32:13.931
And the only way Masika would
know that is if they really

32:13.998 --> 32:15.366
did sleep together.

32:15.433 --> 32:16.701
{\an8}So, she stayed
with you overnight,

32:16.768 --> 32:17.869
{\an8}spent the night with you.

32:17.935 --> 32:19.137
{\an8}She stayed at the
house overnight, yeah.

32:19.203 --> 32:22.106
{\an8}In your bed?

32:22.173 --> 32:23.908
{\an8}Was she in your bed?

32:23.975 --> 32:25.910
{\an8}Just answer her.

32:25.977 --> 32:27.512
{\an8}Yeah, I can
answer your question.

32:27.578 --> 32:29.580
{\an8}Jamal, you're just
going to walk out?

32:29.647 --> 32:31.983
{\an8}Get rid of all his
---- and close the door.

32:32.050 --> 32:33.751
[applause]

32:33.818 --> 32:36.154
So, Nikki, tell us about the
relationship with Mally

32:36.220 --> 32:37.522
before the breakup.

32:37.588 --> 32:38.790
How long were you guys together?

32:38.856 --> 32:41.326
{\an5}Before we broke up I would say
it's about a year and a half.

32:41.392 --> 32:43.227
{\an5}So, you guys were
together for a year and a half.

32:43.294 --> 32:44.128
Yes.

32:44.195 --> 32:45.596
Then why did you break up?

32:45.663 --> 32:48.032
We broke up because Mally
was always in the studio,

32:48.099 --> 32:49.300
he would be with friends.

32:49.367 --> 32:50.902
He was with all these
artists and I was like,

32:50.968 --> 32:53.671
"Baby, if you don't have
time for me, that's okay.

32:53.738 --> 32:55.740
I'll find a man who does, but
I'm not going to just sit here

32:55.807 --> 32:58.476
and be your wifey at home and
wait for you to come home every

32:58.543 --> 33:00.645
night if you were too busy."

33:00.712 --> 33:02.680
And he was like, "----
it, if you want to go, go."

33:02.747 --> 33:04.949
So, it was like a
mutual thing between us.

33:05.016 --> 33:07.352
But the same week we were
looking for a house together,

33:07.418 --> 33:09.253
so I'm like, this is not
going to come in between us.

33:09.320 --> 33:10.888
We always have these
little fights with each other.

33:10.955 --> 33:13.191
So, you didn't think this was a
final breakup, you thought you

33:13.257 --> 33:14.292
were just taking a break.

33:14.359 --> 33:15.827
Absolutely.

33:15.893 --> 33:17.028
I mean, I thought we were
going to make up in a day or two

33:17.095 --> 33:18.863
because that's
how we always do.

33:18.930 --> 33:20.098
Okay.

33:20.164 --> 33:21.866
And Michelle, were you surprised
at the way things turned out

33:21.933 --> 33:23.568
between Nikki and Mally?

33:23.634 --> 33:26.871
Yes, I was because they had
those moments where they fight.

33:26.938 --> 33:29.741
They go back and
forth, back and forth.

33:29.807 --> 33:33.244
So, it was nothing
different in their relationship.

33:33.311 --> 33:35.279
They did have many
of those moments.

33:35.346 --> 33:41.352
For me, the surprise was to
find those pictures that she

33:41.419 --> 33:45.056
was putting on her
Instagram and tagging Nikki.

33:45.123 --> 33:46.791
I never, in my life, tagged her.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.192
I never, in my life.

33:48.259 --> 33:50.395
So, if she didn't do
it, the world did it.

33:50.461 --> 33:53.698
We have those
pictures, so you want to.

33:53.765 --> 33:56.033
Go for it.

33:56.100 --> 33:57.301
You want to sit there and lie?

33:57.368 --> 33:58.302
Why are you on Instagram?

33:58.369 --> 33:59.670
{\an8}You're too old for Instagram.

33:59.737 --> 34:02.340

34:02.407 --> 34:04.142

34:11.349 --> 34:13.451
I already did.

34:13.518 --> 34:14.619
Let me tell you
something, bitch.

34:14.685 --> 34:16.521
Shut your ---- mouth.

You take your clothes off and
I'll take my clothes off and

34:34.972 --> 34:37.708
let's see who will get the
run of their life, bitch.

34:37.775 --> 34:39.476
Did a 70-year-old woman just
say she was going to take

34:39.543 --> 34:40.678
off her clothes?

34:40.745 --> 34:41.746
Watch your mouth.

34:41.813 --> 34:43.815
I'll give you the

34:43.880 --> 34:45.716

Is she serious?

35:37.835 --> 35:39.670
The whole point of this is
to get to the truth, guys.

35:39.737 --> 35:40.771
And if you start yelling
and screaming,

35:40.838 --> 35:43.674
the truth will never come out.

35:43.741 --> 35:44.842
Let's continue.

35:44.909 --> 35:46.244
All right, you were very
confident that Masika

35:46.310 --> 35:47.345
was lying, right?

35:47.411 --> 35:49.614
You didn't believe her,
you refused to believe her.

35:49.680 --> 35:53.117
Why was the hair pulling
a dead giveaway for you?

35:53.184 --> 35:54.385
Is that a the moment,
aha moment?

35:54.452 --> 35:56.854
You know, to be honest with you,
it's still not a dead giveaway.

35:56.921 --> 35:59.156
{\an5}You want to know why, because
when my man was with her,

35:59.223 --> 36:01.459
{\an5}he done ---- three bitches
while he was with her.

36:01.526 --> 36:02.994

36:03.060 --> 36:04.061
{\an5}he was with her.

36:04.128 --> 36:05.830
Oh, never.

36:05.897 --> 36:07.031
Be quiet.

36:07.098 --> 36:09.567
Mally was very open to me while
we were not together about

36:09.634 --> 36:10.735
girls he slept with.

36:10.801 --> 36:12.270
I'm a ---- adult.

36:12.336 --> 36:14.405
If you ----
somebody, I'll swallow it.

We're not together.

36:15.273 --> 36:16.440
It's okay.

36:16.507 --> 36:19.176
So, with her, you know, it's
not like, it wouldn't bother me.

36:19.243 --> 36:21.445
They spent time together,
it's not going to kill me,

36:21.512 --> 36:22.513
you know what I'm saying.

36:22.580 --> 36:23.648
So, I'm like what's up?

36:23.714 --> 36:24.882
Why are you not admitting
to ---- her if you didn't?

36:24.949 --> 36:26.417
He actually did in
the last episode.

36:26.484 --> 36:29.053
So, when I met up with you,
you said my problem with Mally.

36:29.120 --> 36:31.188
You mean you were stalking me?

36:31.255 --> 36:33.591
Nobody cares enough
to stalk you, honey.

36:33.658 --> 36:36.060
You said the problem with me and
Mally was he had numerous

36:36.127 --> 36:37.562
women, right?

36:37.628 --> 36:39.797
So, my point is I didn't know
why he would lie about her,

36:39.864 --> 36:41.532
she's just one
more ho on the list.

36:41.599 --> 36:42.800
No, you're one more ho.

36:42.867 --> 36:43.601
Okay.

36:43.668 --> 36:44.835
Let me ask you this, Masika.

36:44.902 --> 36:46.170
Why do you think Nikki would
not believe you when you were

36:46.237 --> 36:49.807
telling her what you
said was the truth?

36:49.874 --> 36:52.076
My thing about Nikki is her
whole problem is her

36:52.143 --> 36:53.911
insecurity with herself.

36:53.978 --> 36:55.413
You had so many surgeries that
you're trying to hide something.

36:55.479 --> 36:58.516
You had surgery too, but you
don't look good and you

36:58.583 --> 36:59.684
had your lips.

36:59.750 --> 37:01.519
Your lips don't move, baby girl.

37:01.586 --> 37:02.753
Your lips don't move.

37:02.820 --> 37:06.924
They don't move, your lips don't
move, your lips don't move.

37:06.991 --> 37:09.927
Cabbage doll, plastic
doll, you wish to be like her,

37:09.994 --> 37:14.098

a quarter of her.

37:14.165 --> 37:16.000
I'm not going to argue
with somebody's grandma.

Kiss my ass all day long, bitch.

37:19.470 --> 37:21.238
Mom, be quiet.

37:21.305 --> 37:23.708
All right, let
Masika finsh her point.

37:23.774 --> 37:26.844
My mother taught me to respect
my elders, especially someone

37:26.911 --> 37:28.613
who's old enough to
be my mother's mother.

37:28.679 --> 37:31.282
Bitch, I'm not old
enough to be your mother.

37:31.349 --> 37:32.316
You're 40-years-old.

37:32.383 --> 37:34.885
Stop lying about your ---- age.

37:34.952 --> 37:38.189
The reason I have no respect for
you, instead of doing macramé

37:38.255 --> 37:41.258
for plants and crocheting,
you're sticking your uninherited

37:41.325 --> 37:45.463
chiseled nose in
20-year-old women's business.

37:45.529 --> 37:47.832
Any issue that me and Nikki
have is between me and Nikki,

37:47.898 --> 37:49.000
not between me and Nana.

My question is for you, Nikki.

relationship before?

40:10.040 --> 40:11.408
{\an8}She's amazing at what she does?

40:11.475 --> 40:12.610
{\an8}The singing or the ----?

40:12.676 --> 40:14.845
{\an8}Both.

40:14.912 --> 40:18.349
{\an8}If I'm asking you something,
I already know the truth,

40:18.415 --> 40:20.851
{\an8}and clearly I was right.

40:20.918 --> 40:23.587
{\an8}I did fall in love with somebody
else, but me and you broke up.

40:23.654 --> 40:25.222
{\an8}We broke up because I left you.

40:25.289 --> 40:27.024
{\an8}My mug shot looks
better than your work.

40:27.091 --> 40:29.126
{\an8}I'm going to show you what
a masterpiece looks like.

40:29.193 --> 40:30.628
{\an8}Chill.

40:30.694 --> 40:32.630
{\an8}Uncle Fester, keep my
name out of your mouth.

40:32.696 --> 40:33.597
{\an8}Uncle Fester?

40:33.664 --> 40:34.532
{\an8}All right, all right.

40:34.598 --> 40:36.600
{\an8}Did you ever get
that circumcision?

40:36.667 --> 40:38.068
{\an8}You're talking
about the turtleneck.

40:38.135 --> 40:41.305
{\an8}Nia didn't tell you about
her dad, that he was not

40:41.372 --> 40:43.007
{\an8}her biological father.

40:43.073 --> 40:44.775
{\an8}How is it nobody's business,
but it's public information

40:44.842 --> 40:46.844
{\an8}the whole ---- internet
know, but I don't know.

40:46.911 --> 40:47.845
{\an8}Shut the ---- up.

40:47.912 --> 40:49.313
{\an8}You got a real problem.

40:49.380 --> 40:51.115
{\an8}She felt like I threw her
under the bus when she sent me a

40:51.182 --> 40:53.918
{\an8}screen shot of Masika saying
Ray was flirting with her.

40:53.984 --> 40:55.753
{\an8}You're completely a
pathological liar.

40:55.820 --> 40:56.687
{\an8}Shut up, bitch.

40:56.754 --> 41:00.724
{\an8}I just want you to
knock her out one time.

41:00.791 --> 41:01.792
{\an5}♪♪
