WEBVTT

00:02.336 --> 00:03.837
ARE YOU COOKING DINNER?

00:03.837 --> 00:06.174
YOU SEE IT, DON'T YOU?

00:06.174 --> 00:07.741
MOM'S
PLANNING A BIG WEDDING,

00:07.741 --> 00:10.778
SO DAD'S DOING
THE COOKING AND LAUNDRY.

00:10.778 --> 00:14.148
THAT'S WHY I'M HUNGRY
AND GOING COMMANDO.

00:14.148 --> 00:17.785
ALL RIGHT, FREE WILLY,
I'LL GIVE YOU A CHOICE.

00:17.785 --> 00:19.087
YOU CAN EITHER FIGURE OUT

00:19.087 --> 00:22.190
HOW TO WORK
THE WASHING MACHINE, OR...

00:22.190 --> 00:25.359
MM-HMM, YOU CAN MAKE
YOUR OWN UNDERWEAR.

00:25.359 --> 00:29.630
THIS IS A GAME OF CHICKEN
YOU'RE GONNA LOSE, OLD MAN.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.765
GO CLEAN YOURSELF.

00:39.107 --> 00:41.942
BROOKE,
THIS IS MY HUSBAND GEORGE

00:41.942 --> 00:43.511
AND MY MOTHER-IN-LAW
BENNY.

00:43.511 --> 00:45.279
OH, IT'S SO NICE
TO MEET YOU.

00:45.279 --> 00:47.081
I'M SORRY
I'M TAKING ALL OF ANGIE'S TIME.

00:47.081 --> 00:50.518
I JUST DIDN'T REALIZE IT TOOK
SO MUCH TO PLAN A WEDDING.

00:50.518 --> 00:52.420
WE NEVER HAD
WEDDING PLANNERS.

00:52.420 --> 00:54.422
ALL YOU HAD
TO DO WAS GET TO VEGAS,

00:54.422 --> 00:56.424
SAY YOUR VOWS
AT THE DRIVE-THROUGH CHAPEL

00:56.424 --> 00:58.126
AND BE ON YOUR WAY.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.329
WELL, BROOKE'S SITUATION'S

01:01.329 --> 01:03.331
A LITTLE DIFFERENT
THAN YOURS, MOM.

01:03.331 --> 01:06.634
FIRST OF ALL, SHE'S NOT A MINOR,
SHE'S NOT PREGNANT,

01:06.634 --> 01:09.637
AND SHE KNOWS THE LAST NAME
OF THE GUY SHE'S MARRYING.

01:09.637 --> 01:11.639
I KNEW HIS LAST NAME.
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW

01:11.639 --> 01:14.142
HE WAS GONNA BE USING
IT FOR HIS OTHER FAMILY, TOO.

01:14.142 --> 01:15.709
YOU KNOW,

01:15.709 --> 01:17.711
IF HE SAYS HE'S WORKING LATE,
HE'S CHEATING.

01:17.711 --> 01:19.713
IF HE GOES TO THE STORE,
HE'S CHEATING.

01:19.713 --> 01:23.050
MEN NEVER GET OFF THE COUCH
UNLESS THEY'RE CHEATING.

01:23.050 --> 01:24.485
ANYWAY...

01:24.485 --> 01:28.956
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR OH-SO-MAGICAL DAY.

01:28.956 --> 01:30.758
BROOKE,
DON'T LISTEN TO HER.

01:30.758 --> 01:33.627
GEORGE AND I HAVE BEEN MARRIED
FOR 19 YEARS.

01:33.627 --> 01:35.863
OH, MY GOSH.
WHAT'S YOUR SECRET?

01:35.863 --> 01:39.867
THE THREE L's--
LOVE, LAUGHTER AND, UH...

01:39.867 --> 01:42.069
YEAH, WHAT'S THAT THIRD ONE
YOU'RE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT?

01:42.069 --> 01:44.037
LISTENING.

01:44.037 --> 01:46.207
OH, YEAH, LISTENING.

01:46.207 --> 01:48.008
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE GONNA SAY LAUNDRY.

01:48.008 --> 01:52.913
I'M ALWAYS WASHING
MY FIANCÃ©'S BLOODY CLOTHES.

01:52.913 --> 01:54.215
NO, HE'S A BUTCHER.

01:54.215 --> 01:55.516
OH.
OH!

01:55.516 --> 01:57.818
WELL,
I HOPE HE'S A BUTCHER.

01:57.818 --> 01:59.453
OKAY, BROOKE, UM,

01:59.453 --> 02:01.455
I WILL CALL YOU LATER
ABOUT THE FLOWERS.

02:01.455 --> 02:03.891
AND DON'T WORRY,
YOUR WEDDING IS IN GOOD HANDS.

02:03.891 --> 02:05.893
OKAY, GREAT.
HEY, TELL ME SOMETHING.

02:05.893 --> 02:08.596
ANTHONY AND I ARE TRYING
TO WAIT UNTIL THE HONEYMOON.

02:08.596 --> 02:11.532
ANY IDEAS ON HOW TO KEEP HIM
FROM GETTING TURNED ON?

02:11.532 --> 02:13.734
AHEM. IF YOU WANNA
KILL THE MOOD,

02:13.734 --> 02:16.770
YOU COULD DIG AROUND
IN YOUR EAR WITH A Q-TIP

02:16.770 --> 02:21.275
AND PULL OUT SOMETHING
THAT LOOKS LIKE A CANDY APPLE.

02:21.275 --> 02:24.412
STILL, THAT ONLY WORKS
HALF THE TIME.

02:24.412 --> 02:26.714
(chuckles) WELL,
I GUESS IT'S GOING BACK

02:26.714 --> 02:28.649
TO STARTING A FIGHT
FOR NO REASON.

02:28.649 --> 02:29.783
(chuckles)

02:29.783 --> 02:33.987
PICK UP YOUR SOCKS!
I'M NOT YOUR MOTHER!

02:33.987 --> 02:36.156
I GUESS THAT'LL WORK.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.426
(laughs) GREAT,
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

02:38.426 --> 02:40.194
BYE-BYE.
TAKE CARE. DRIVE SAFE.

02:40.194 --> 02:43.063
YEAH,
I'M GONNA CALL YOU.
OKAY. CALL ME.
(chuckles)

02:43.063 --> 02:46.166
SHE IS A MONSTER!

02:47.401 --> 02:50.438
I CAN'T WORK
WITH HER ANYMORE. I QUIT.

02:50.438 --> 02:52.139
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

02:52.139 --> 02:54.475
SHE'S CRAZY, GEORGE.

02:54.475 --> 02:58.078
OH... I KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

02:58.078 --> 03:01.148
YOU GET TWO BEAUTIFUL GIRLS
TOGETHER AND THE NEXT THING...

03:01.148 --> 03:03.417
(imitates cats hissing)

03:06.520 --> 03:10.891
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
SHE CALLS ME 50 TIMES A DAY.

03:10.891 --> 03:12.893
NOTHING IS EVER RIGHT.

03:12.893 --> 03:15.829
SHE CAN'T MAKE A SIMPLE DECISION
TO SAVE HER LIFE.

03:15.829 --> 03:18.799
SO WOMEN ARE INDECISIVE.
I KNOW ONE WOMAN

03:18.799 --> 03:20.801
WHO COULDN'T DECIDE
WHAT TO NAME HER OWN KIDS.

03:20.801 --> 03:23.337
THAT'S WHY HER SON'S
LEGAL NAME

03:23.337 --> 03:28.609
IS MAX VICTOR ROBERTO
MAGIC JOHNSON LOPEZ.

03:30.378 --> 03:34.214
ALL RIGHT,
MAYBE THEY WEREN'T ALL YOURS.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.716
DO YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:35.716 --> 03:37.718
I KNOW THAT
THIS IS A BIG COMMISSION,

03:37.718 --> 03:39.720
BUT IT IS NOT WORTH
THE HEADACHE.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.756
I HAVE TO CALL HER AND TELL HER
I AM NOT GONNA PLAN HER WEDDING.

03:42.756 --> 03:43.857
SO YOU'RE GONNA QUIT

03:43.857 --> 03:46.927
JUST BECAUSE
YOU DON'T WANNA WORK HARD?

03:46.927 --> 03:49.430
EXCUSE ME, I WORK HARD!

03:49.430 --> 03:51.832
I AM TIRED OF YOU
BELITTLING MY JOB.

03:51.832 --> 03:54.335
OH, QUE LA. I'M NOT
BELITTLING YOUR JOB, ANGIE.

03:54.335 --> 03:56.404
IT JUST SEEMS THAT
MOST OF WHAT YOU DO

03:56.404 --> 04:00.073
IS CALL OTHER PEOPLE
SO THEY CAN DO THE WORK.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.709
THAT'S ALL
YOU THINK I DO?

04:01.709 --> 04:03.877
OKAY... YOU CALL THE PRINTER,
THEY PRINT THE INVITATIONS.

04:03.877 --> 04:06.447
YOU CALL THE CATERER,
THEY MAKE THE FOOD.

04:06.447 --> 04:08.716
YOU CALL THE BAKER,
THEY BAKE THE CAKE.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.718
THE HARDEST THING YOU DO,
YOU'RE LIKE THAT...

04:10.718 --> 04:13.721
BEEP, BEEP, BEEP, BEEP,
BEEP, BEEP, BEEP.

04:13.721 --> 04:17.358
ALL RIGHT, THAT MIGHT'VE BEEN
A LITTLE BELITTLING.

04:17.358 --> 04:20.461
IT IS NOT JUST
MAKING PHONE CALLS.

04:20.461 --> 04:21.962
I HELP A BRIDE

04:21.962 --> 04:24.264
THROUGH ONE OF THE MOST
STRESSFUL TIMES OF HER LIFE.

04:24.264 --> 04:27.167
THERE IS A WHOLE EMOTIONAL SIDE
TO WEDDING PLANNING

04:27.167 --> 04:28.769
THAT YOU
KNOW NOTHING ABOUT.

04:28.769 --> 04:31.138
PLEASE, ANGIE.
A STRESSED-OUT BRIDE IS NOTHING.

04:31.138 --> 04:32.640
LET ME TELL YOU THIS,

04:32.640 --> 04:34.642
AT THE FACTORY,
I WORK WITH EX-CONS,

04:34.642 --> 04:37.010
SUBSTANCE ABUSERS
AND SEXUAL HARASSERS.

04:37.010 --> 04:39.012
AND I'M NOT JUST
TALKING ABOUT MY MOM.

04:39.012 --> 04:41.815
THERE'S OTHER PEOPLE
LIKE THAT THERE, TOO.

04:41.815 --> 04:44.184
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU THINK YOU KNOW EVERYTHING.

04:44.184 --> 04:46.954
YOU WOULDN'T LAST A MINUTE
PLANNING A WEDDING.

04:46.954 --> 04:49.557
PLEASE, I COULD DO YOUR JOB
WITH MY EYES CLOSED

04:49.557 --> 04:53.927
AND BOTH LEGS
TIED BEHIND MY BACK.

04:53.927 --> 04:57.698
OH, YEAH, THEN WHY DON'T YOU
PLAN BROOKE'S WEDDING?

04:57.698 --> 05:00.167
FINE, BUT I GET
TO KEEP THE COMMISSION,

05:00.167 --> 05:03.637
AND I'M NOT USING THAT MONEY
ON THE HOUSE OR THE KIDS.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.939
I'M GONNA SPEND IT ON SOMETHING
THAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED--

05:05.939 --> 05:09.142
A GIANT PAINTING OF ME THAT
I CAN PUT OVER THE MANTLE.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.078
I'M-A BE LIKE THAT.
WATCH OUT.

05:11.078 --> 05:13.080
THERE IS NOT GOING
TO BE A COMMISSION

05:13.080 --> 05:15.082
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
PULL THIS JOB OFF.

05:15.082 --> 05:17.551
AND DON'T CALL ME
FOR HELP BECAUSE...

05:17.551 --> 05:19.987
BEEP, BOOP, BEEP, BOOP,
BEEP, BEEP, BEEP, BEEP...

05:19.987 --> 05:23.056
HI, YOU'VE REACHED ANGIE'S
CLUELESS HUSBAND HOTLINE.

05:23.056 --> 05:27.828
PLEASE PRESS NOTHING FOR HELP
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GETTIN' IT!

05:27.828 --> 05:30.964
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

05:34.201 --> 05:37.137
* ALL MY FRIENDS

05:37.137 --> 05:38.706
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

05:50.418 --> 05:52.219
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH YOUR GOLF CLUBS?

05:52.219 --> 05:55.055
BROOKE'S ON HER WAY
OVER HERE TO MEET WITH YOU

05:55.055 --> 05:57.057
ABOUT HER WEDDING.
HOW LONG CAN IT TAKE?

05:57.057 --> 05:59.760
I ASK HER WHAT SHE WANTS,
I WRITE IT DOWN,

05:59.760 --> 06:02.630
I MAKE SOME CALLS ON THE COURSE
IN BETWEEN SHOTS.

06:02.630 --> 06:05.766
(laughs)
THIS IS MY FAVORITE PART,

06:05.766 --> 06:09.903
WHEN YOU'RE ALL SMUG
RIGHT BEFORE YOU FAIL.

06:09.903 --> 06:13.073
LIKE THAT TIME YOU
PUT ON YOUR OWN FIREWORKS SHOW

06:13.073 --> 06:14.642
FOR THE 4th OF JULY.

06:14.642 --> 06:18.479
MAYBE I LIKE FIREWORKS
AT EYE LEVEL.

06:18.479 --> 06:19.847
(doorbell rings)

06:19.847 --> 06:22.149
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
KEEP AN EYE ON THOSE.

06:23.884 --> 06:27.220
BYE, MOM.
OOH, CARMEN, WAIT.
I'M NOT WORKING TODAY.

06:27.220 --> 06:30.924
MAYBE WE COULD
HANG OUT TOGETHER?
OH, NO, NO.
I'VE GOT A POETRY READING.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.926
WELL, I COULD GO WITH YOU.
WE HAVEN'T SPENT A LOT

06:32.926 --> 06:34.962
OF MOTHER-DAUGHTER TIME
TOGETHER LATELY.

06:34.962 --> 06:37.898
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT THE POEM'S
ABOUT HOW WE'RE DRIFTING APART.

06:37.898 --> 06:41.068
IT WOULD KILL IT
IF YOU WERE THERE.

06:41.068 --> 06:41.969
SEE YA.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.739
HEY, BROOKE.
COME ON IN.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.274
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE

06:47.274 --> 06:49.743
ANGIE CAN'T DO MY WEDDING
BECAUSE OF JURY DUTY.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.446
WHAT KIND OF TRIAL
LASTS A MONTH?
WELL, SHE'S NOT ALLOWED
TO TALK ABOUT THE TRIAL

06:52.446 --> 06:54.181
AND NEITHER AM I,

06:54.181 --> 06:58.018
BUT LET'S JUST SAY THAT
IT'S A HIGH PROFILE CELEBRITY.

06:58.018 --> 06:59.653
WATCH OUT. HEE HEE!

07:01.789 --> 07:04.157
BUT WHY DID SHE SUGGEST
YOU PLAN THE WEDDING?

07:04.157 --> 07:07.861
DON'T YOU WORK
IN A FACTORY?
YES, A DREAM FACTORY.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.864
I MAKE WEDDING FANTASIES
COME TRUE.

07:10.864 --> 07:14.034
NOW COME IN AND TAKE A LOOK
AT MY PORTFOLIO.

07:16.504 --> 07:19.006
OKAY.

07:19.006 --> 07:22.843
OH, THIS IS AMAZING!
(chuckles)

07:22.843 --> 07:28.516
WAIT, ARE THESE JUST PICTURES
CUT OUT OF A BRIDAL MAGAZINE?

07:28.516 --> 07:30.317
WELL, IF YOU DON'T WANT
A WEDDING

07:30.317 --> 07:33.086
THAT'S GONNA MAKE IT
INTO A NATIONAL MAGAZINE,

07:33.086 --> 07:35.523
THEN MAYBE I'M NOT
YOUR PLANNER. GOOD DAY.

07:35.523 --> 07:37.958
NO.
I SAID, GOOD DAY.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.828
EVERYONE ELSE
HAS QUIT ON ME.

07:40.828 --> 07:43.030
ALL THE GOOD WEDDING PLANNERS
ARE TAKEN.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.965
YOU'RE MY LAST OPTION.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.968
WELL, IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME
I'VE BEEN A GIRL'S LAST OPTION.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.838
AND LIKE ALL THE OTHER TIMES,
I'LL TAKE IT.

07:50.838 --> 07:53.006
LET'S GO OVER
THE DETAILS NOW.

07:53.006 --> 07:54.842
ANGIE SAID YOU WANTED
TO GET MARRIED MARCH 29th.

07:54.842 --> 07:57.878
NOW DO YOU WANT
AN INDOOR OR OUTDOOR WEDDING?

07:57.878 --> 07:58.679
OUTDOOR.

07:58.679 --> 07:59.980
OKAY. BAND OR DEEJAY?

07:59.980 --> 08:02.683
BAND.
OKAY. FISH OR CHICKEN?

08:02.683 --> 08:04.752
WELL, DON'T YOU USUALLY
GET BOTH?

08:04.752 --> 08:06.954
BUFFET IT IS.
I'LL SEE YOU MARCH 29th.

08:06.954 --> 08:08.956
NOW CALL ME
THE NIGHT BEFORE,

08:08.956 --> 08:11.158
BUT JUST TO MAKE SURE
EVERYTHING'S COOL.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.160
ALL RIGHT? LATER.

08:13.160 --> 08:16.363
(laughs)

08:16.363 --> 08:19.066
OH, MY GOD, I BELIEVED YOU
FOR, LIKE, A SECOND.

08:19.066 --> 08:21.569
THANK GOD YOU HAVE
A SENSE OF HUMOR,

08:21.569 --> 08:23.370
BECAUSE I AM TOTALLY
STRESSED OUT.

08:23.370 --> 08:25.873
WE HAVE, LIKE, A MILLION THINGS
TO TALK ABOUT TODAY,

08:25.873 --> 08:28.008
WITH THE GUEST LIST,
THE FLOWERS, THE LOCATIONS...

08:28.008 --> 08:30.010
YOU KNOW,
I HAD AN APPOINTMENT

08:30.010 --> 08:32.245
DOWN AT THE GOLF COURSE
THIS AFTERNOON.
NO.

08:32.245 --> 08:34.281
NO GOLF COURSES.
COUNTRY CLUBS ARE DONE TO DEATH.

08:34.281 --> 08:36.483
OKAY, I WAS THINKING SOMETHING
MORE LIKE A PARK.

08:36.483 --> 08:38.285
EXCEPT NOTHING WITH
TOO MANY FLOWERS

08:38.285 --> 08:40.487
'CAUSE MY GRANDMOTHER'S
ALLERGIC TO BEES.

08:40.487 --> 08:42.823
OOH, AND I WAS THINKING
SOMETHING NEXT TO A STREAM,

08:42.823 --> 08:44.357
BECAUSE I'M PISCES,

08:44.357 --> 08:46.560
AND THAT'S THE FISH SIGN
SO IT'LL BE GOOD LUCK.

08:46.560 --> 08:49.362
YOU'RE NOT
WRITING ANY OF THIS DOWN.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.999
SCRIBBLE, SCRIBBLE!

08:51.999 --> 08:55.368
NOW I WANT TORCHES EVERYWHERE,
BECAUSE FIRE BALANCES WATER,

08:55.368 --> 08:57.638
AND I DEFINITELY WANT BALANCE
IN MY MARRIAGE. (chuckles)

08:57.638 --> 08:59.640
BUT NONE OF THOSE
HAWAIIAN TORCHES, OKAY?

08:59.640 --> 09:01.642
THIS IS A WEDDING.
IT'S NOT A PIG ROAST.

09:01.642 --> 09:04.277
YOU KNOW,
IT NEEDS TO BE CLASSY.

09:04.277 --> 09:07.380
LIKE THE MUSIC--THE MUSIC BEFORE
THE SERVICE HAS TO BE A QUARTET,

09:07.380 --> 09:09.382
AND THEY SHOULD
ALL BE WEARING TUXEDOS.

09:09.382 --> 09:12.252
EXCEPT FOR THE WOMEN.
THEY SHOULD BE WEARING GOWNS.

09:12.252 --> 09:13.821
BUT NOT WHITE.

09:13.821 --> 09:16.724
MAYBE EGGSHELL OR PEARL,
BUT THAT'S PUSHING IT.

09:16.724 --> 09:18.726
ARE YOU GETTING
ALL OF THIS?

09:18.726 --> 09:21.629
UM... (chuckles)
NO BEES.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.769
(knock on door)
HEY.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.070
DID YOU GET THE GLUE?

09:30.070 --> 09:32.072
YEAH, I STOPPED
BY THE DRUGSTORE.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.074
MAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU TOOK A PERSONAL DAY

09:34.074 --> 09:35.776
TO FINISH
THESE WEDDING PROGRAMS.

09:35.776 --> 09:39.012
LET ME SHOW YOU
WHAT I GOTTA DO 150 TIMES.

09:39.012 --> 09:41.314
I CUT A LITTLE RIBBON,
RIGHT?

09:41.314 --> 09:43.951
I MAKE A TINY BOW.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.953
I GLUE IT
TO THE WEDDING PROGRAM,

09:45.953 --> 09:47.688
AND I SPRAY IT WITH
JUST A HINT...

09:47.688 --> 09:49.957
OF LAVENDER.

09:49.957 --> 09:52.626
BUT NOT TOO MUCH
'CAUSE IT LEAVES A SPOT!

09:54.294 --> 09:57.297
SOMETIMES YOU GOTTA
DO IT OVER AGAIN.

09:57.297 --> 09:59.633
MAN, HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN AT THIS?

09:59.633 --> 10:01.234
SIX HOURS.
OH.

10:01.234 --> 10:03.937
IT WOULD'VE BEEN DONE FASTER
BUT EVERY FIVE MINUTES OR SO,

10:03.937 --> 10:05.939
I GOTTA
LOOK DOWN MY PANTS

10:05.939 --> 10:08.441
TO REMIND MYSELF
I'M STILL A MAN.

10:08.441 --> 10:11.211
WAIT A MINUTE, I THOUGHT
YOU FINISHED THESE YESTERDAY?

10:11.211 --> 10:12.746
I DID.

10:12.746 --> 10:14.748
BUT APPARENTLY
I MADE A HUGE MISTAKE,

10:14.748 --> 10:16.549
AND NOW I GOTTA REDO
ALL OF 'EM

10:16.549 --> 10:19.152
BECAUSE BROOKE DOESN'T WANNA
GET MARRIED ON "MARCH 29th."

10:19.152 --> 10:23.023
SHE WANTS TO GET MARRIED
ON THE "29th OF MARCH."

10:24.291 --> 10:26.660
I HATE HER, ERNIE.
I HATE HER SO MUCH.

10:26.660 --> 10:29.897
HEY, LOOK WHAT SHE DID
TO MY HANDS.

10:29.897 --> 10:31.699
(cell phone rings)

10:36.536 --> 10:38.839
BROOKE,
IT'S 1:00 IN THE MORNING.

10:38.839 --> 10:41.742
LIKE I TOLD YOU
AT 12:30 AND 12:45,

10:41.742 --> 10:44.945
I GOT EVERYTHING
UNDER CONTROL.

10:44.945 --> 10:47.380
NO, YOU CAN'T COME OVER AND LOOK
AT THE WEDDING PROGRAMS.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.016
I'M ALREADY IN BED.

10:49.016 --> 10:51.719
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, I'M STANDING
NEXT TO MY CHUNKY ASSISTANT?

10:51.719 --> 10:53.486
(knock on door)

10:53.486 --> 10:55.856
OOH.
HEY, DON'T LOOK NOW,

10:55.856 --> 10:58.959
BUT THE HOTTEST BURGLAR EVER
IS IN YOUR YARD.

11:00.593 --> 11:03.931
WHAT THE HELL
IS SHE DOING HERE?

11:05.332 --> 11:08.035
OH, I COULDN'T SLEEP.
WE HAVE SO MUCH TO GO OVER.

11:08.035 --> 11:11.071
NOW... I WAS THINKING
ABOUT THE BIRDS IN THE PARK,

11:11.071 --> 11:13.573
AND I DON'T WANT THEM
FLYING DURING THE CEREMONY.

11:13.573 --> 11:15.075
THEY'RE GONNA
BE BOMBARDING GUESTS

11:15.075 --> 11:16.710
AND EATING
THE HORS D'OEUVRES.

11:16.710 --> 11:19.079
SO WE NEED
TO GET A SCARECROW,

11:19.079 --> 11:21.715
BUT HE'S GONNA
HAVE TO WEAR A TUX.

11:21.715 --> 11:24.617
THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME.

11:24.617 --> 11:26.787
HI, I'M LANCE...

11:26.787 --> 11:28.956
THE CHUNKY ASSISTANT.

11:28.956 --> 11:30.490
I'LL BE DOING
YOUR FITTING.

11:30.490 --> 11:34.027
AND IT'S OKAY IF YOU GET NAKED
BECAUSE I'M GAY.

11:36.429 --> 11:38.098
BEAT IT,
ROSIE O'DONNELL.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.371
LOOK, I TOLD YOU,
I HAVE EVERYTHING UNDER CONTROL.

11:44.371 --> 11:47.040
WE CAN TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS
IN THE MORNING.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.042
NO, GEORGE,
I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO SLEEP

11:49.042 --> 11:51.044
UNTIL WE GO OVER
THIS SEATING CHART.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.046
OKAY, NOW I TOLD YOU
MY PARENTS ARE DIVORCED,

11:53.046 --> 11:55.048
AND YOU PUT THEM
AT THE SAME TABLE.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.284
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
I'LL MOVE YOUR MOM TO TABLE 11,

11:57.284 --> 12:00.253
AND I'LL BUMP YOUR AUNT ELLEN
OVER TO TABLE SIX.

12:00.253 --> 12:02.756
OH, WAIT. IS THAT AT LEAST
100 FEET AWAY FROM UNCLE PETER?

12:02.756 --> 12:04.257
WHY?

12:04.257 --> 12:07.327
BECAUSE HE HAS
A RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST HER.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.296
WHAT ARE THOSE?

12:09.296 --> 12:11.664
OH, THOSE ARE THE SECOND BATCH
OF WEDDING PROGRAMS, HUH.

12:11.664 --> 12:13.934
"29th OF MARCH,"

12:13.934 --> 12:16.369
LITTLE RIBBON, TINY BOW,
WATCH OUT...

12:16.369 --> 12:18.071
HINT OF LAVENDER.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.940
EVERYTHING'S PERFECT.

12:19.940 --> 12:22.976
NO, I WANTED CHAMPAGNE RIBBONS.
THESE ARE GOLD.

12:22.976 --> 12:25.345
YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO REDO ALL OF THESE.

12:25.345 --> 12:27.881
WHY?

12:27.881 --> 12:30.650
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS TO ME?

12:30.650 --> 12:34.054
BECAUSE YOU SAID I COULD HAVE
THE WEDDING OF MY DREAMS,

12:34.054 --> 12:37.124
AND IN MY DREAMS,
THE RIBBON IS CHAMPAGNE!

12:37.124 --> 12:40.961
WELL, WHEN DO YOU DREAM?
YOU'RE NEVER ASLEEP.

12:40.961 --> 12:42.495
YOU'RE ALWAYS
CALLING ME.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.497
LOOK, THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN GOLD AND CHAMPAGNE.

12:44.497 --> 12:47.734
AND I'M NOT TAKING A SCARECROW
TO GET FITTED FOR A TUX!

12:47.734 --> 12:49.736
YOU KNOW WHY
GOD MADE YOU SO PRETTY?

12:49.736 --> 12:52.339
TO COVER UP
ALL THAT CRAZY.

12:52.339 --> 12:55.008
OKAY, I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY
WEDDINGS YOU'RE JUGGLING,

12:55.008 --> 12:57.410
BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE
TOO STRESSED OUT TO HANDLE MINE.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.412
YOU'RE FIRED.

12:59.412 --> 13:02.415
I WILL BE BACK
FOR THE REST OF THESE.

13:03.616 --> 13:07.087
WHAT IS ALL THAT YELLING?

13:08.455 --> 13:12.025
WHAT IS BROOKE DOING OVER HERE
AT 1:00 IN THE MORNING?

13:12.025 --> 13:14.394
OH, SHE WAS SO HAPPY
WITH MY WEDDING PROGRAMS

13:14.394 --> 13:16.396
SHE WANTED
TO THANK ME IN PERSON,

13:16.396 --> 13:19.666
SO SHE'S TAKING A BOX
TO SHOW HER FRIENDS.

13:19.666 --> 13:21.334
THAT--THAT--THAT...

13:21.334 --> 13:23.703
THAT EXPLAINS
EVERYTHING, RIGHT?

13:23.703 --> 13:26.639
IS SOMETHING GOING ON?

13:26.639 --> 13:29.309
YEAH, THERE IS.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.879
I THINK IT'S OBVIOUS
THAT I CAN DO YOUR JOB,

13:31.879 --> 13:34.447
SO LET'S CALL
THIS WHOLE THING OFF, OKAY?

13:34.447 --> 13:37.184
LOOK, LET'S STOP THE FIGHTING
AND START THE LOVING.

13:37.184 --> 13:39.686
I DON'T CARE IF THERE'S
SO MUCH WAX IN HERE

13:39.686 --> 13:41.488
I CAN MAKE A CANDLE.
Â¿SABES QUÃ©?

13:41.488 --> 13:44.024
I'LL LIGHT IT
AND SET THE MOOD.

13:44.024 --> 13:47.260
YOU DON'T REALIZE,
THIS IS THE EASY STUFF.

13:47.260 --> 13:51.064
THINGS DON'T GET TOUGH
UNTIL THE DAY OF THE WEDDING.

13:51.064 --> 13:53.600
PFFT. I'M NOT GONNA ADMIT
YOU CAN DO MY JOB

13:53.600 --> 13:57.170
UNTIL BROOKE WALKS DOWN
THAT AISLE AND SAYS, "I DO."

13:57.170 --> 14:00.507
THEN I'LL JUST HAVE
TO KEEP AT IT THEN.

14:00.507 --> 14:01.474
(sniffs)

14:04.244 --> 14:08.916
ARE YOU CRYING?
A LITTLE BIT.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.217
BUT I'M JUST
THINKING ABOUT

14:10.217 --> 14:13.253
HOW BEAUTIFUL
THE WEDDING'S GONNA BE.

14:22.662 --> 14:25.899
BROOKE, GIVE ME A SECOND CHANCE
TO PLAN YOUR WEDDING.

14:25.899 --> 14:27.767
I DON'T THINK SO.

14:27.767 --> 14:29.769
OKAY, YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND
ANOTHER PLANNER THIS LATE.

14:29.769 --> 14:32.272
I PROMISE YOU, FROM HERE ON IN,
EVERYTHING WILL BE PERFECT.

14:32.272 --> 14:34.274
AND YOU'LL FIX
THE PROGRAMS?

14:34.274 --> 14:36.476
I'LL PAY FOR 'EM
OUT OF MY OWN POCKET.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.378
FINE.

14:38.378 --> 14:41.381
BUT IF YOU MAKE
ONE MORE MISTAKE,

14:41.381 --> 14:42.449
YOU'RE FIRED.

14:42.449 --> 14:44.551
THANK YOU.
YOU WON'T REGRET THIS.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.987
YOU KNOW, THEY SAY
THAT DREAMS CAN'T COME TRUE,

14:46.987 --> 14:49.489
BUT THOSE PEOPLE
NEVER HIRED ME!

14:49.489 --> 14:52.059
THE PEOPLE IN THE STORY WHO SAID
THAT DREAMS CAN'T COME TRUE.

14:52.059 --> 14:55.528
THE--THE--THE NAYSAYERS
OF DREAMS. (laughs)

14:57.097 --> 14:59.566
I'M SORRY, I'VE BEEN
WORKING WITH GLUE ALL NIGHT.

15:03.770 --> 15:05.738
SMELL YOUR PROGRAM.

15:05.738 --> 15:09.576
YOU SMELL YOUR PROGRAM YET?
A LOT OF WORK WENT INTO THAT.

15:09.576 --> 15:12.245
SMELL YOUR PROGRAM.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.347
SMELL YOUR PROGRAM.

15:14.347 --> 15:15.482
SMELL IT.

15:19.786 --> 15:21.788
WHAT ARE YOU TWO
DOING HERE?

15:21.788 --> 15:23.290
I WANTED TO SEE

15:23.290 --> 15:25.492
IF YOU WERE REALLY
GONNA PULL THIS THING OFF.

15:25.492 --> 15:27.460
AND I CAME TO CHECK OUT
THE BRIDESMAIDS.

15:27.460 --> 15:29.662
WELL,
YOU'RE OUT OF LUCK, VIC.

15:29.662 --> 15:33.300
THE ONLY SINGLE ONE
ISN'T THAT EASY ON THE EYES.
AY, GEORGE, PLEASE.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.935
AT THIS STAGE OF MY LIFE,
I WANT A COMPANION--

15:35.935 --> 15:37.304
SOMEONE I CAN TALK TO,

15:37.304 --> 15:40.207
SOMEONE I CAN SHARE
MY LIFE WITH, A SOUL MATE.

15:40.207 --> 15:41.508
SHE'S OVER THERE.

15:41.508 --> 15:44.978
AY, DIOS MIO!
LOOK AT THAT HORSE FACE.

15:44.978 --> 15:48.348
(whispers)
GEORGE, GEORGE.

15:52.552 --> 15:55.855
BROOKE,
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

15:55.855 --> 15:57.690
THANK YOU.
I DON'T FEEL BEAUTIFUL.

15:57.690 --> 16:00.193
MY STOMACH'S IN A KNOT
AND MY HEART IS RACING

16:00.193 --> 16:02.195
AND I'M SWEATING
IN THIS DRESS.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.331
OKAY,
LISTEN TO ME, BROOKE.

16:04.331 --> 16:07.134
I'VE NEVER SEEN A WOMAN
LOOK MORE AMAZING

16:07.134 --> 16:09.136
IN A WEDDING DRESS
RIGHT NOW THAN YOU DO.

16:09.136 --> 16:11.604
AHEM.

16:11.604 --> 16:14.207
SORRY, BABY, NOT YOUR DAY.
DEAL WITH IT.

16:14.207 --> 16:19.546
A BEAUTIFUL BOUQUET
FOR A BEAUTIFUL BRIDE.

16:19.546 --> 16:21.281
WAAPAHH!

16:21.281 --> 16:24.951
IT'S JUST WHAT I WANTED,
A DOZEN YELLOW--

16:24.951 --> 16:27.087
OH, MY GOD!
WHAT?

16:27.087 --> 16:29.089
THERE ARE 13 ROSES HERE.
IT'S BAD LUCK.

16:29.089 --> 16:31.291
I'LL TAKE ONE OUT.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.360
NO, IT'S TOO LATE.
I ALREADY HELD IT.

16:33.360 --> 16:36.129
IT'S OKAY.
I GOT A BACKUP BOUQUET.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.267
WAAPAHH!

16:40.267 --> 16:42.202
IT'S THE SAME BOUQUET.

16:42.202 --> 16:45.205
NO, IT'S NOT.
COUNT THE ROSES.

16:45.205 --> 16:47.006
LOOK, THE DAMAGE
IS DONE, OKAY?

16:47.006 --> 16:50.043
JUST TELL EVERYBODY TO GO HOME
AND THE WEDDING IS OFF.

16:50.043 --> 16:52.145
BECAUSE
OF A STUPID SUPERSTITION?

16:52.145 --> 16:53.513
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.515
EVERYTHING
IS SUPPOSED TO BE PERFECT.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.517
THIS IS AN OMEN
THAT MY MARRIAGE IS DOOMED,

16:57.517 --> 17:00.087
AND I'M GONNA GET DIVORCED
JUST LIKE MY PARENTS

17:00.087 --> 17:02.589
AND EVERYBODY ELSE
IN MY FAMILY.

17:02.589 --> 17:04.524
AAH! (sobbing)

17:06.326 --> 17:10.230
THIS IS THAT EMOTIONAL STUFF
I WAS TALKING ABOUT.

17:10.230 --> 17:12.399
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT,
IT'S EMOTIONAL.

17:12.399 --> 17:14.401
I TIED TINY RIBBONS.
I SPRAYED LAVENDER.

17:14.401 --> 17:16.203
ANGIE, I BUSTED MY ASS!

17:16.203 --> 17:18.771
THIS ISN'T HER WEDDING ANYMORE,
IT'S MINE.

17:18.771 --> 17:22.109
AND I'M NOT GONNA LET HER RUIN
MY SPECIAL DAY. (crying)

17:29.382 --> 17:31.384
LOOK, I THINK YOU'RE MAKING
A BIG MISTAKE.

17:31.384 --> 17:35.088
NO, THIS WEDDING WAS A MISTAKE.
OKAY, I CAN'T DO THIS.

17:35.088 --> 17:36.889
BROOKE, LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING.

17:36.889 --> 17:39.659
DO YOU LOVE YOUR FIANCÃ©? DO YOU
WANNA SPEND YOUR LIFE WITH HIM?

17:39.659 --> 17:42.329
OF COURSE.
THEN HOW CAN YOU
THROW IT ALL AWAY

17:42.329 --> 17:44.164
JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE
IN YOUR FAMILY GOT DIVORCED?

17:44.164 --> 17:45.665
GEORGE,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

17:45.665 --> 17:47.967
EVERYBODY IN MY FAMILY
IS DIVORCED.

17:47.967 --> 17:50.537
MY PARENTS, MY SISTER,
MY BROTHER...

17:50.537 --> 17:52.539
MY COUSIN CHERYL
IS ON HER FOURTH MARRIAGE,

17:52.539 --> 17:54.441
AND THAT'S NOT GONNA LAST
'CAUSE THE GUY'S

17:54.441 --> 17:56.042
ALREADY CHEATING ON HER.

17:56.042 --> 17:58.745
DON'T WORRY, CHERYL.
IT'S JUST A RUMOR.

18:00.713 --> 18:03.116
I DON'T WANNA BE HER!

18:03.116 --> 18:05.418
JUST BECAUSE
YOUR FAMILY'S MESSED UP

18:05.418 --> 18:07.420
DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE
GONNA REPEAT THEIR MISTAKES.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.423
LOOK, MY DAD ABANDONED
MY MOM AND ME WHEN I WAS 2,

18:10.423 --> 18:12.425
BUT THAT DIDN'T AFFECT
ME AND ANGIE.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.427
WE'VE BEEN MARRIED
FOR 19 YEARS.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.496
IS IT GREAT?
ARE YOU HAPPY EVERY DAY?

18:16.496 --> 18:18.665
IS IT EVERYTHING
YOU WANTED?

18:18.665 --> 18:22.034
IS SHE BEHIND ME?

18:22.034 --> 18:26.105
THEN MY MARRIAGE IS PERFECT,
AND I'M HAPPY, LIKE...

18:26.105 --> 18:29.276
(chuckles)
99% OF THE TIME.

18:29.276 --> 18:31.077
HONEY.
50%.

18:31.077 --> 18:32.545
GEORGE.
75%.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.547
AND STOP TALKING TO ME
THROUGH THE BATHROOM DOOR,

18:34.547 --> 18:36.383
BECAUSE WHEN I'M IN THERE
LIKE THAT...

18:36.383 --> 18:39.686
(trills)
THAT'S GEORGE TIME.

18:39.686 --> 18:42.555
WHAT MY HUSBAND
IS TRYING TO SAY IS THAT

18:42.555 --> 18:45.425
YOU CAN'T EXPECT
YOUR MARRIAGE TO BE PERFECT.

18:45.425 --> 18:48.127
IF YOU DO, YOU'RE JUST
GONNA BE DISAPPOINTED.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.530
YOU'RE BOTH
GONNA MAKE MISTAKES.

18:50.530 --> 18:53.500
ONE OF YOU MIGHT BELITTLE
THE OTHER ONE'S JOB, AND...

18:53.500 --> 18:55.935
THEN YOUR STUPID PRIDE'S
GONNA KEEP YOU FROM APOLOGIZING.

18:55.935 --> 18:58.438
AND THEN YOU END UP
PLANNING YOUR FIRST WEDDING,

18:58.438 --> 19:02.842
AND YOU REALIZE
YOU'RE IN WAY OVER YOUR HEAD.

19:02.842 --> 19:05.278
SO THIS IS THE FIRST WEDDING
YOU'VE EVER PLANNED?

19:05.278 --> 19:07.414
YEAH, AND YOU'RE WEARING
A WHITE DRESS,

19:07.414 --> 19:10.317
SO WE BOTH
STRETCHED THE TRUTH A LITTLE.

19:12.151 --> 19:15.955
NOW... STOP SWEATING
THE SMALL STUFF.

19:15.955 --> 19:18.491
OKAY,
TAKE THIS BOUQUET.

19:18.491 --> 19:21.294
YOU WALK DOWN THAT AISLE,
AND YOU MAKE ANTHONY

19:21.294 --> 19:24.997
THE SECOND LUCKIEST GUY
IN THE WORLD.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.366
THANKS, GEORGE.

19:36.108 --> 19:37.877
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

19:37.877 --> 19:41.481
(Wagner's "Bridal Chorus
from 'Lohengrin'" playing)

19:51.958 --> 19:53.726
(thunder rumbles)

19:55.194 --> 19:56.596
STAY STRONG.

19:56.596 --> 20:00.233
THERE ARE NO SUCH THING
AS OMENS. (chuckles)

20:07.274 --> 20:09.242
PICK IT UP. PICK IT UP!

20:10.643 --> 20:12.211
YOU GOT TENTS,
DIDN'T YOU?

20:12.211 --> 20:14.213
"YOU GOT TENTS,
DIDN'T YOU?"

20:14.213 --> 20:16.249
LIGHTNING!

20:16.249 --> 20:18.951
THERE'S METAL UNDERWIRE
IN THIS DRESS!

20:18.951 --> 20:20.853
(Brooke) AAH!

20:20.853 --> 20:22.021
YOU'LL BE FINE.

20:22.021 --> 20:24.424
THIS IS YOUR DAY.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.259
START THE CAR.
THIS ISN'T GONNA END WELL.

20:26.259 --> 20:28.728
START THE CAR!

20:28.728 --> 20:31.331
WAIT,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!

20:31.331 --> 20:33.333
COME BACK!

20:33.333 --> 20:36.336
THIS IS MY DAY!

20:36.336 --> 20:38.471
(sobbing)

20:42.074 --> 20:43.142
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE JOKING.

20:43.142 --> 20:44.744
I CAN'T BELIEVE

20:44.744 --> 20:47.414
YOU WASTED ALL THE MONEY
YOU MADE FROM BROOKE'S WEDDING.

20:47.414 --> 20:49.716
I DIDN'T WASTE IT.
(knock on door)

20:49.716 --> 20:52.885
HEY, GEORGE, DID Y--
OH, YOU GOT IT!

20:52.885 --> 20:54.721
YEAH, CHECK IT OUT.

20:57.824 --> 21:00.760
DUDE, THAT IS AWESOME!

21:00.760 --> 21:02.194
IT'S STUPID.

21:02.194 --> 21:05.398
IS IT STUPID THAT NO MATTER
WHERE YOU GO IN THE LIVING ROOM,

21:05.398 --> 21:07.099
MY EYES FOLLOW YOU?

21:07.099 --> 21:08.568
THAT'S ART.

21:10.437 --> 21:13.740
WHY DOES IT SAY
"ONE OF TEN" ON HERE?

21:13.740 --> 21:16.509
GO UP TO THE BEDROOM,
LIE DOWN

21:16.509 --> 21:18.411
AND LOOK UP!

21:18.411 --> 21:19.712
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU!

21:19.712 --> 21:21.848
I'LL BE LIKE THAT.
WATCH OUT!
