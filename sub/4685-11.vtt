08:35.224 --> 08:38.059
Again!

08:38.727 --> 08:40.354
- Hey!
- You think this is easy?

08:40.479 --> 08:41.606
This map looks like

08:41.607 --> 08:42.731
the human nervous system!

08:42.856 --> 08:43.962
Is that Staten Island

08:43.962 --> 08:45.067
or a hypothalamus?

08:42.856 --> 08:45.067
You tell me!

08:46.318 --> 08:47.507
I'm telling you

08:47.508 --> 08:48.695
we should take a cab!

08:48.820 --> 08:49.821
We'll never catch one

08:49.822 --> 08:50.822
this time of day.

08:50.948 --> 08:52.283
Look, If we take

08:52.284 --> 08:53.617
the right train, we can

08:50.948 --> 08:53.617
be there in 10 minutes.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.327
That's a big "if."

08:55.453 --> 08:56.454
Meanwhile,

08:56.455 --> 08:57.455
my bathroom threat level

08:57.579 --> 08:58.580
just went from

08:58.581 --> 08:59.581
green to yellow!

09:05.212 --> 09:06.713
- Did you know
- this man is playing

09:06.838 --> 09:08.028
A traditional

09:08.029 --> 09:09.216
Chinese instrument

09:06.838 --> 09:09.216
called the ehru?

09:09.341 --> 09:10.906
If I had my sitar,

09:10.907 --> 09:12.470
we could kick it

09:09.341 --> 09:12.470
Eastern-style.

09:14.346 --> 09:16.027
- Okay, I've finally
- figured out the map.

09:18.476 --> 09:20.978
Oh, great!

09:21.103 --> 09:22.771
- Let's just check
- the map on the wall.

09:28.277 --> 09:29.341
Does it tell us

09:29.342 --> 09:30.404
where we are?

09:30.529 --> 09:32.590
- No, because - someone named "Wang"
- Feels the need to

09:32.614 --> 09:34.283
- Let everyone know
- where he's been.

09:34.408 --> 09:36.535
And that he rules.

09:36.660 --> 09:37.786
Why don't we

09:37.787 --> 09:38.912
just ask someone?

09:39.037 --> 09:40.247
(SCREAMS)

09:41.290 --> 09:42.791

09:42.916 --> 09:44.647
That's the

09:44.648 --> 09:46.378
least scary thing that

09:42.916 --> 09:46.378
we've seen down here.

09:46.504 --> 09:48.046
- Excuse me,
- Mr. Dragon. Hi.

09:48.172 --> 09:49.277
How do you

09:49.278 --> 09:50.382
get to Battery Park?

09:52.301 --> 09:53.302
The four train,

09:53.303 --> 09:54.303
got it. Thank you.

09:56.555 --> 09:58.182
Zuri, hurry!

09:58.307 --> 09:59.350
I'm going

09:59.351 --> 10:00.392
as fast as I can.

10:00.518 --> 10:02.020
It's times like this,

10:02.021 --> 10:03.521
I miss my pull-ups.

10:14.072 --> 10:15.637
Crickets are the

10:18.160 --> 10:19.953

10:21.079 --> 10:23.707
It's sayonara, spidey.

Nope.

Please let this

11:37.678 --> 11:38.990
be the right train.

11:39.116 --> 11:40.117
I've always

11:40.118 --> 11:41.118
been a good girl.

11:41.243 --> 11:42.827
- Okay, once
- in seventh grade,

11:42.953 --> 11:44.871
- I stole - Mindy Dropkin's
- Chocolate bar.

11:44.996 --> 11:46.498
- But all I had
- was an apple.

11:46.624 --> 11:48.126
And quite frankly,

11:48.127 --> 11:49.627
with her acne,

11:46.624 --> 11:49.627
I was doing her a favor.

11:49.751 --> 11:50.941
So please let this

11:50.942 --> 11:52.129
be the right train.

What would we

11:58.885 --> 12:01.721
do without you?

12:09.020 --> 12:10.897
Ha! You had that coming.

12:24.035 --> 12:26.746
And now we are in Germany!

12:26.871 --> 12:28.790
This truly is a magic train.

12:33.295 --> 12:34.672
- I think
- we're in Yorkville,

12:34.796 --> 12:35.922
A German neighborhood

12:35.923 --> 12:37.048
on the upper east side.

12:37.174 --> 12:38.863
Which is

12:38.864 --> 12:40.552
even farther away

12:37.174 --> 12:40.552
from Battery Park!

12:40.678 --> 12:41.930
When will I learn

12:41.931 --> 12:43.180
not to take directions

12:40.678 --> 12:43.180
from dragons?

12:44.764 --> 12:46.159
- I'm never going
- to make the fair,

12:46.183 --> 12:48.143
- And my whole grade
- depends on that report.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.415
You will!

12:49.416 --> 12:50.562
You'll get to the fair.

12:50.688 --> 12:51.751
Ravi, you will see

12:51.752 --> 12:52.814
the Statue of Liberty.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.129
And Zuri,

12:54.130 --> 12:55.317
I will get you to

12:52.939 --> 12:55.317
a park and a bathroom.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.443
I already took care

12:56.444 --> 12:57.444
of the bathroom thing.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.155
You don't want to know.

13:02.073 --> 13:03.074
You're right.

13:03.075 --> 13:04.075
I don't.

13:04.201 --> 13:05.494
Okay,

13:05.495 --> 13:06.786
I'm pretty sure

13:04.201 --> 13:06.786
I've got it now.

13:06.911 --> 13:08.059
So we take

13:08.060 --> 13:09.206
just a few more stops,

13:09.331 --> 13:10.687
and then we transfer to

13:10.688 --> 13:12.042

get out of here!

14:14.062 --> 14:16.774
we're ever lost,

14:16.940 --> 14:18.066
- stay put
- and hug a tree.

- and if he goes right,

14:37.711 --> 14:39.963
You hit him with this.

14:40.088 --> 14:41.923
What if he goes left?

14:42.048 --> 14:43.048
You hit him with this.

17:33.762 --> 17:34.847
Your colorful,

17:34.848 --> 17:35.931
and somewhat abusive,

17:33.762 --> 17:35.931
traditional dance.

17:37.975 --> 17:39.684
Auf wiedersehen, Fritz!

17:39.810 --> 17:41.937
See? Watching every

17:41.938 --> 17:44.063
episode of Project Runway

17:39.810 --> 17:44.063
does pay off.

17:48.485 --> 17:50.591
Remember,

17:50.592 --> 17:52.697
no matter what happens,

17:48.485 --> 17:52.697
we have to stick together.

17:52.823 --> 17:55.492
Right. Together.

17:55.617 --> 17:57.118
(BOTH SCREAMING)

17:57.243 --> 17:59.997
It's every man for himself!

18:06.003 --> 18:07.150
Did you get him?

18:07.151 --> 18:08.296
No, he's on the counter.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.007
What?

18:11.008 --> 18:12.759
Now he's on the cereal!

18:14.761 --> 18:16.304
Man, that thing is fast.

18:16.429 --> 18:17.555
Not as fast as me.

18:23.061 --> 18:24.521
Where are you going?

18:24.646 --> 18:25.710
Anywhere but here.

18:25.711 --> 18:26.773
And if this gets

18:24.646 --> 18:26.773
any more terrifying,

18:26.898 --> 18:28.316
- I might even
- take the stairs!

18:33.279 --> 18:34.698
(BOTH SCREAMING)

18:38.035 --> 18:39.202
He's getting closer!

18:43.540 --> 18:45.166
- Mr. Kipling,
- you saved us!

18:47.418 --> 18:49.254
And my therapist says

18:49.255 --> 18:51.089
you can't solve your

18:47.418 --> 18:51.089
problems by eating them.

18:55.343 --> 18:56.783
You are smaller than

18:56.784 --> 18:58.221
I thought you would be.

18:58.346 --> 19:00.161
And I did not

19:00.162 --> 19:01.975
expect Lady Liberty

18:58.346 --> 19:01.975
to have such hairy pits.

19:03.935 --> 19:05.937
Whee!

19:06.063 --> 19:07.085
We will be at the fair

19:07.086 --> 19:08.106
in five minutes.

19:08.272 --> 19:09.592
- Told you
- the subway was great.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.112
- (WOMAN ON PA)
- Stalled train ahead.

19:14.237 --> 19:15.489
We'll be stopped here for

19:15.490 --> 19:16.740
45 minutes to an hour.

19:16.865 --> 19:18.867
Have a good day.

19:18.992 --> 19:21.182
What? You finally say

19:21.183 --> 19:23.371
something I can understand

19:18.992 --> 19:23.371
and that's it?

19:23.496 --> 19:25.060
I hate you! I hate you!

19:25.061 --> 19:26.624
I hate you! I hate you!

19:26.750 --> 19:28.418
People are staring.

19:28.543 --> 19:29.857
And that's

19:29.858 --> 19:31.170
saying something

19:28.543 --> 19:31.170
in New York.

19:31.629 --> 19:33.048
I give up.

19:33.049 --> 19:34.465
I messed up

19:31.629 --> 19:34.465
everyone's day.

19:34.591 --> 19:36.509
- Zuri never even
- got to go to the park.

19:36.634 --> 19:38.136
- Whee! - Look at me!
- Look at me!

19:42.140 --> 19:43.224
Don't look at me!

19:45.643 --> 19:46.833
Ravi never got to see

19:46.834 --> 19:48.021
the Statue of Liberty.

19:48.146 --> 19:49.522
Say, "Green card."

19:53.818 --> 19:56.071
Mr. Lady Liberty is

19:56.072 --> 19:58.322
even more wonderful

19:53.818 --> 19:58.322
than I dreamed.

19:58.448 --> 20:01.325
She/he gave me a coupon

20:01.451 --> 20:03.266
for a free hot dog

20:03.267 --> 20:05.080
at the Liber-dog Deli.

20:05.747 --> 20:06.873
What a country!

20:09.876 --> 20:11.065
Jessie,

20:11.066 --> 20:12.253
look around you.

20:12.378 --> 20:13.609
Zuri and Ravi

20:13.610 --> 20:14.839
had a great time.

20:14.965 --> 20:16.404
And I did get to see

20:16.405 --> 20:17.842
parts of New York

20:14.965 --> 20:17.842
I've never seen.

20:17.968 --> 20:19.844
Or smelled before.

20:19.970 --> 20:21.596
Hold up.

20:21.597 --> 20:23.222
Did you take pictures of

20:19.970 --> 20:23.222
everything you saw today?

20:23.347 --> 20:24.537
Yep. You want to see

20:24.538 --> 20:25.725
a rat inside a burrito?

20:25.850 --> 20:28.227
Pass. No.

20:28.352 --> 20:29.792
What I mean is

20:29.793 --> 20:31.230
you met tons of

20:28.352 --> 20:31.230
different people

20:31.355 --> 20:32.649
from tons of

20:32.650 --> 20:33.942
different cultures

20:31.355 --> 20:33.942
all over the city, right?

20:34.067 --> 20:35.485
Right.

20:35.610 --> 20:37.133
Here's a traditional

20:37.134 --> 20:38.655
Dominican band

20:35.610 --> 20:38.655
playing Merengue.

20:38.780 --> 20:40.136
This is an ehru,

20:40.137 --> 20:41.491
a two stringed

20:38.780 --> 20:41.491
Chinese instrument

20:41.616 --> 20:43.139
that sounds kind of like

20:43.140 --> 20:44.661
a cat giving birth.

20:44.786 --> 20:46.038
Ooh, and here's Ravi

20:46.039 --> 20:47.288
eating a German delicacy,

20:47.413 --> 20:50.167
pickled pork knuckles.

20:50.291 --> 20:51.584
And here's

20:51.585 --> 20:52.877
Ravi throwing up

20:50.291 --> 20:52.877
pickled pork knuckles.

20:55.046 --> 20:56.152
So do a little more

20:56.153 --> 20:57.256
research tonight,

20:57.381 --> 20:58.571
slap on a title page,

20:58.572 --> 20:59.759
and there's your "A" paper!

21:01.011 --> 21:02.679
You're right!

21:02.804 --> 21:04.806
Thanks, Jessie!

21:04.931 --> 21:06.120
Oh, next week I have

21:06.121 --> 21:07.308
a paper on primates.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.153
- Can we take the subway
- to the Bronx Zoo?

21:10.937 --> 21:12.814
- You can.
- I'm taking a cab.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.113
Okay, everything's

21:20.114 --> 21:21.948
back to normal.

21:22.073 --> 21:23.450
Except for that

21:23.451 --> 21:24.826
big dent in the counter.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.203
By the way,

21:26.204 --> 21:27.453
when your parents are home

21:24.951 --> 21:27.453
don't ever move that vase.

21:29.206 --> 21:30.748
- Hey, wanna go
- watch a movie?

21:30.874 --> 21:32.855
Sure. Anything

21:32.856 --> 21:34.836
except Arachnophobia,

21:30.874 --> 21:34.836
or Charlotte's Web.

21:40.050 --> 21:42.426
(BOTH GASPING)

21:44.428 --> 21:45.806
Remember when we read

21:45.807 --> 21:47.182
that the speckled recluse

21:47.306 --> 21:48.599
- could lay up to
- 2,000 eggs?

21:48.725 --> 21:49.851
Uh-huh.

21:49.976 --> 21:51.457
I think our spider

21:51.458 --> 21:52.937
was a mommy.

21:53.063 --> 21:54.606
And we got ourselves

21:54.607 --> 21:56.149
some angry orphans!

21:58.026 --> 21:59.590
All right,

21:59.591 --> 22:01.154
guys, keep it down.

21:58.026 --> 22:01.154
I don't want to wake Zuri.

22:01.279 --> 22:02.406
I'm not asleep.

22:02.407 --> 22:03.531
I just didn't

22:01.279 --> 22:03.531
want to walk.

22:05.575 --> 22:06.910
Well played.

22:07.577 --> 22:08.870
I'm starving.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.059
Do you think

22:10.060 --> 22:11.122
Bertram has dinner ready?

22:11.248 --> 22:12.395
(SCREAMING)

22:12.396 --> 22:13.541
Bertram, they're on

22:11.248 --> 22:13.541
your back!

22:13.666 --> 22:14.856
Get it off!

22:14.857 --> 22:16.044
Get it off!

22:17.545 --> 22:19.297
He looks busy.

22:19.422 --> 22:20.527
Anyone for the

22:20.528 --> 22:21.632
Statue of Liber-dog Deli?

22:21.758 --> 22:22.926
ALL: Yeah!

22:23.051 --> 22:24.157
I'm going to order

22:24.158 --> 22:25.262
the Benjamin Frankfurter.

22:28.265 --> 22:29.473
