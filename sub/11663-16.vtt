Blanche, listen, honey, I need a favor.

01:11.567 --> 01:13.834
Oh, no. Forget it. You'll just laugh.

01:13.900 --> 01:15.033
-I won't.
-You will.

01:15.100 --> 01:16.700
-I won't.
-You will.

01:16.767 --> 01:19.967
You'll turn it into one hearty laugh
at my expense.

01:20.033 --> 01:22.567
Dorothy, this really hurts me. I will not.

01:23.100 --> 01:24.567
-You won't even giggle?
-No.

01:24.633 --> 01:28.233
-Not even a titter?
-Dorothy, I won't laugh.

01:28.300 --> 01:33.100
Okay. I have a blind date tonight.
I want you to go out with him.

01:33.166 --> 01:36.233
-Ha ha ha ha!
-Ha ha ha ha!

01:41.600 --> 01:45.567
You're right, Dorothy.
This is one hearty laugh at your expense.

01:47.233 --> 01:50.233
-At least Blanche didn't laugh.
-And you know why?

01:50.300 --> 01:53.767
I was singing a song in my mind,
"Camptown Races."

01:53.834 --> 01:55.633
I didn't hear a word you said.

01:58.133 --> 02:01.333
She said she had a date tonight
and she wants you to go out with him.

02:05.533 --> 02:10.467
Oh, that's funny. Hey, that is really
fun. I mean, that is funny.

02:10.533 --> 02:14.000
-It's even funnier the second time.
-Ditto!

02:14.066 --> 02:16.367
-Ha ha.
-Ha ha.

02:22.734 --> 02:25.600
-I'm sorry, Dorothy.
-Yes, we're sorry, honey.

02:26.100 --> 02:28.500
Now tell me why you need this favor.

02:28.567 --> 02:32.433
-No way. You'll only laugh at me.
-Now stop it, Dorothy.

02:32.500 --> 02:35.300
I really do want to help you if I can.

02:35.367 --> 02:38.166
We're not monsters.
We promise not to laugh.

02:38.233 --> 02:39.233
Right.

02:40.767 --> 02:44.333
All right. I want you to go out
with my blind date tonight because...

02:45.200 --> 02:46.800
I have other plans.

02:47.834 --> 02:48.934
Thank you.

02:52.333 --> 02:55.266
Blanche, are you going to do this?

02:55.333 --> 02:57.400
My date's on his way over, and...

02:57.900 --> 03:02.133
I just won a ticket on the radio to
Beatle mania.

03:02.200 --> 03:03.400
Shut up, Ma.

03:04.934 --> 03:08.400
Beatle mania? You're giving up a date
for Beatle mania?

03:08.467 --> 03:12.900
Rose, the Beatles were the first and only
rock 'n' roll group

03:12.967 --> 03:14.934
that I ever really loved.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.800
When they came to Shea stadium,
I got a ticket,

03:17.867 --> 03:20.533
but one of my kids got the flu.

03:21.066 --> 03:25.333
It was one of those times when you pretend
that you love your kids more

03:25.400 --> 03:28.266
than something you really want to do.

03:28.967 --> 03:31.367
-Yeah, right.
-Oh, boy. I remember.

03:31.433 --> 03:35.467
I've always regretted missing out
on that one night of history.

03:35.967 --> 03:38.100
I never got to see them...

03:38.367 --> 03:40.967
and the closest I'll ever get is
Beatle mania.

03:41.033 --> 03:45.100
It's not really the Beatles,
but it's an incredible simulation.

03:45.166 --> 03:46.700
Blanche, what do you say?

03:47.600 --> 03:52.900
-I say go and have a good time.
-Oh, oh, thank you. Thank you.

03:52.967 --> 03:54.066
Oh...

03:55.934 --> 03:58.400
Oh, Blanche, that was sweet of you.

03:58.467 --> 04:03.066
Well, Dorothy's a good friend.
Besides, maybe this guy will be cute.

04:20.433 --> 04:21.800
Uh...

04:23.000 --> 04:24.066
uh...

04:24.133 --> 04:26.000
I'm Dorothy Zbornak.

04:32.200 --> 04:36.000
Sophia, you stop that.
You are not Dorothy Zbornak.

04:37.133 --> 04:38.533
I'm Dorothy Zbornak.

04:40.900 --> 04:43.433
All right, all right, but I am a Petrillo.

04:43.500 --> 04:47.100
I've been known to make princes and kings
leave their wives and palaces

04:47.166 --> 04:49.100
and dance the bossa nova.

04:50.934 --> 04:52.734
Excuse me, what does that mean?

04:53.633 --> 04:56.500
I think it means today is placebo pill
day.

04:58.033 --> 04:59.433
I'm going to bed.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.200
This is all very confusing.

05:02.266 --> 05:06.800
I'm supposed to meet Dorothy Zbornak
at 7:30 for a dinner date.

05:06.867 --> 05:09.333
Which one of you
really is Dorothy Zbornak?

05:09.400 --> 05:12.467
I am Dorothy's best friend Blanche.

05:12.533 --> 05:15.500
I'm filling in for her because she's dead.

05:20.233 --> 05:26.700
(calm music playing)

05:32.300 --> 05:34.433
Morning, Blanche.
How was your date last night?

05:34.900 --> 05:36.500
How was my date last night?

05:36.567 --> 05:39.567
I woke up alone.
That's how my date was last night.

05:41.633 --> 05:44.834
He didn't open my car door,
he did not escort me into the restaurant,

05:44.900 --> 05:45.967
didn't pull out my chair.

05:46.033 --> 05:49.500
And then when the check came,
he made me pay half the bill.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.767
What did I ever do to deserve that?

05:52.834 --> 05:55.834
Sounds to me like you put
out before dinner again.

Ma, even you can't spoil my good mood.
Oh, what a glorious day.

06:19.734 --> 06:22.333
You must have had a great time
at Beatle mania.

06:22.400 --> 06:27.800
It was like seeing the Beatles,
and the fans went crazy,

06:27.867 --> 06:31.333
screaming and jumping up and down
just like it was the sixties.

06:31.400 --> 06:37.533
Everyone except me. I had a fabulous time,
but I managed to retain my dignity.

06:38.066 --> 06:39.400
(Liverpool accent) Mornin', blokes.

06:48.100 --> 06:51.967
He followed me home, Ma.
Can I keep him? Can I? Huh?

06:52.700 --> 06:57.300
-Dorothy, what's going on here?
-Ma, this is Don. Don, my mother.

06:57.867 --> 07:01.000
Ma, Don plays George in Beatle mania.

07:01.066 --> 07:03.333
And Paul when Ernie's sick.

07:04.633 --> 07:07.600
Well, good for you. Dorothy.

07:10.667 --> 07:12.667
What the hell are you
doing with this loser?

07:14.400 --> 07:18.734
Ma, he is not a loser.
He's a wonderful and gifted musician.

07:18.800 --> 07:21.934
I know this sounds odd, but...
when he was on stage,

07:22.000 --> 07:27.000
our eyes met, and it was...
well, it was... it was kismet.

07:27.500 --> 07:31.233
Suddenly, we were spiritually connected
soul mates.

07:31.533 --> 07:34.400
And then you threw your underwear at me,
didn't you, love?

07:41.800 --> 07:44.600
So sue me.
I just got caught up in the moment.

07:45.800 --> 07:50.367
And then afterwards we went for coffee,
and then... one thing led to another,

07:50.433 --> 07:52.266
and we wound up here.

07:52.700 --> 07:55.633
-What, is that so bad?
-I can't believe you.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.266
You're actually standing
here telling your mother

07:58.333 --> 08:00.834
you had sex with a complete stranger?

08:00.900 --> 08:04.367
No, but it was an incredible simulation.

08:07.700 --> 08:13.667
(mellow music playing)

08:17.700 --> 08:19.467
(doorbell chimes)

08:22.834 --> 08:26.367
-Blanche, I have to talk to you.
-What, do I owe you gas money?

08:26.433 --> 08:27.900
Let me get my purse.

08:30.066 --> 08:33.333
Please let me explain
the way I acted last night.

08:33.800 --> 08:36.700
My wife died two years ago.

08:36.767 --> 08:38.233
I really haven't dated since then.

08:38.300 --> 08:40.433
I wanted to get back
into the swing of things,

08:40.500 --> 08:43.500
so I read up on
what modern women want,

08:43.567 --> 08:48.266
equality, pay their own way.
I guess it's all got me confused.

08:48.333 --> 08:52.533
Oh, Jerry. Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.033
Come over here.

08:55.066 --> 08:58.367
Now let me clear up
any confusion you might have.

08:59.033 --> 09:01.433
I don't want to be treated as your equal.

09:01.500 --> 09:02.633
You don't?

09:02.700 --> 09:05.300
I want to be treated a lot better
than you.

09:08.166 --> 09:11.200
I mean, really. Like a goddess...

09:11.767 --> 09:13.633
who likes to go barhopping.

09:14.700 --> 09:18.300
-So, Blanche, go out with me again?
-I don't know.

09:18.367 --> 09:20.500
I do hate breaking in widowers.

09:22.166 --> 09:26.700
-Actually, I feel more like a schoolboy.
-I guess I could go out with a schoolboy.

09:59.867 --> 10:01.400
Girls, I have great news.

10:01.467 --> 10:05.367
I finally convinced Don to quit
Beatle mania. Isn't that wonderful?

10:05.433 --> 10:09.100
Dorothy, you're 60 years old
and breaking up fake rock 'n' roll bands.

10:09.166 --> 10:10.867

-Yoko Zbornak?

10:35.667 --> 10:37.667
I know what this is about.

10:37.967 --> 10:41.266
It's about that British invasion
that's been going on in your bedroom.

10:43.033 --> 10:47.233
Ma, this is about art
and love and inspiration,

10:47.300 --> 10:49.800
and... you make it sound dirty.

10:51.834 --> 10:52.867
Thank you.

10:59.934 --> 11:03.200
Girls, I have a question,
a vital question.

11:03.266 --> 11:06.900
I want you to think long
and hard before answering.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.100
-Am I ugly?
-Yes.

11:16.400 --> 11:17.400
I mean...

11:17.800 --> 11:20.800
I've always thought
of myself as ravishing. But...

11:21.500 --> 11:23.500
Is something changing? Is there...

11:23.567 --> 11:27.500
is there all of a sudden something
disgusting and unattractive about me?

11:27.567 --> 11:28.900
Yes.

11:31.967 --> 11:34.200
Now, you cut it out,
you old worm woman.

11:36.633 --> 11:38.100
What's wrong, Blanche?

11:38.166 --> 11:40.233
I'm in love, that's what's wrong.

11:40.800 --> 11:46.166
I am desperately, completely,
helplessly in love with Jerry.

11:46.934 --> 11:49.600
Nobody since George
has made me feel this way...

11:50.133 --> 11:52.767
-and I just hate it.
-Why?

11:54.000 --> 11:55.934
Oh, I don't even know if I can say this.

11:56.700 --> 11:57.934
He won't touch me.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.800
Five dates and not even a kiss.

12:02.433 --> 12:05.667
Just when I finally meet somebody
who can make me happy...

12:05.734 --> 12:07.367
just when I need it the most...

12:08.333 --> 12:10.467
I can't believe I'm about to say this.

12:11.834 --> 12:14.600
Blanche Devereaux has lost her sex appeal.

12:19.834 --> 12:21.500
They're always the last to know.

12:26.667 --> 12:31.367
(calm music playing)

12:34.734 --> 12:36.066
What are you looking for, Blanche?

12:36.133 --> 12:38.333
Batteries. You know, I bought one of those

12:38.400 --> 12:41.500
subliminal self-esteem tapes,
but my batteries are dead.

12:42.266 --> 12:45.333
Oh, you don't need those trendy tapes,
Blanche.

12:45.400 --> 12:48.166
You know what I do when I need
a shot of self-esteem?

12:48.233 --> 12:51.300
Yeah, you put on that dopey
"it's okay to be me" sweatshirt,

12:51.367 --> 12:53.967
go lock yourself in the bathroom,
and then like a moron,

12:54.033 --> 12:55.734
kiss yourself silly in the mirror.

12:58.166 --> 13:00.633
And I guess I'll be back in there again
tonight.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.967
Oh, Sophia, do you know
where any batteries are?

13:06.033 --> 13:07.934
Oh, you make me sick.

13:13.900 --> 13:17.133
Oh, I am home, dear, dear friends.

13:17.200 --> 13:19.266
What a glorious night.

13:19.767 --> 13:22.867
I just hate you. There you go again,

13:22.934 --> 13:26.400
rubbing it in how I'm having a sex drought
and you're having a bumper crop.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.900
And I'm expecting more rain.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.533
Now, you just stop that.

13:34.367 --> 13:36.200
Blanche, think about it.

13:36.266 --> 13:40.934
Would it really be so bad if you and Jerry
just had a platonic relationship?

13:41.000 --> 13:45.400
I already have friends
I don't have sex with... you guys.

13:47.233 --> 13:49.567
Oh. What am I going to do?

13:49.633 --> 13:53.667
Don't one of you have a story about some
man who wouldn't sleep with you?

13:53.734 --> 13:56.033
Golly, I sure don't.

13:57.166 --> 13:58.300
Stop it.

13:59.834 --> 14:04.700
-I have a story that'll end all stories.
-Oh, Rose, please.

14:04.767 --> 14:07.567
But, honey, make it fast.
10 words or less.

14:07.633 --> 14:11.367
But your curiosity's going to be so
piqued, you'll beg for more.

14:11.433 --> 14:14.367
When did a man refuse to sleep with you?

14:15.166 --> 14:17.166
The time I was radioactive.

14:22.033 --> 14:23.433
How about you, Sophia?

14:23.500 --> 14:27.367
There was that time Warren Beatty passed
up the chance to sleep with me.

14:29.567 --> 14:31.633
So, Rose, you say you were radioactive?

14:33.100 --> 14:36.734
(calm music playing)

14:36.800 --> 14:38.066
(knock on door)

14:45.333 --> 14:47.867
Oh, Jerry, how nice of you to stop by.

14:48.667 --> 14:50.900
Why'd you ask me
to pick you up at a motel?

14:52.200 --> 14:55.233
They're having a Beatle mania cast
party at our house.

14:55.300 --> 14:58.967
Last I looked, Ringo was hanging over the
toilet singing "Help!"

15:00.533 --> 15:03.233
I can understand that.
I was in the band in high school.

15:03.300 --> 15:06.834
-We went crazy--
-Yeah, yeah. Get in here.

15:10.867 --> 15:13.800
-Interesting place, Blanche.
-Oh, thank you.

15:14.233 --> 15:15.834
But so bright.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.300
Let me dim the lights.

15:18.367 --> 15:19.367
(clap)

15:23.166 --> 15:24.166
(clap)

15:27.700 --> 15:30.567
How about I make us a little drink
before we leave?

15:30.633 --> 15:32.767
-Well, maybe one.
-Ok.

15:33.433 --> 15:36.600
Huh. I wonder how this thing works.

15:39.133 --> 15:41.467
Oh, just like <i>The Jetsons.</i>

15:44.200 --> 15:47.200
Now, let's just sit ourselves down here
and have a little bubbly.

15:48.033 --> 15:50.967
You know what goes great
with champagne?

15:51.600 --> 15:52.767
Me.

15:54.867 --> 15:57.400
We seem to be missing a chair, Blanche.

15:57.800 --> 15:59.266
Yes, so we are.

15:59.333 --> 16:02.333
Well, let's see what I can do to fix it.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.333
Ha ha ha!

16:09.433 --> 16:11.033
Fixed it!

16:12.166 --> 16:15.967
-My God. This bed's vibrating.
-They better be at these prices.

16:17.367 --> 16:20.100
I don't think this was a very good idea.

16:20.166 --> 16:26.367
I know what you need, some music.
You need some nice soothing music.

16:26.433 --> 16:29.834
(exotic music plays)

16:29.900 --> 16:33.100
-I don't want any music.
-Ok.

16:33.166 --> 16:35.467
-(faster music plays)
-Hey, hey! Ho, ho!

16:35.533 --> 16:38.266
-Blanche!
-Oh! Oh!

16:38.333 --> 16:41.166
-Oh, no. A mirror!
-(slap)

16:44.033 --> 16:46.033
Now you're getting into the spirit
of things.

16:46.100 --> 16:47.400
No, I'm not.

16:47.467 --> 16:49.333
How do you turn this thing off?

16:49.400 --> 16:52.066
I don't know. I never tried to turn it
off.

16:58.266 --> 16:59.800
Oh! Ho ho!

17:00.533 --> 17:01.667
Goodness.

17:03.333 --> 17:05.200
Ooh!

17:07.600 --> 17:09.000
Oh!

17:11.000 --> 17:12.200
Oh, forget it.

17:12.800 --> 17:14.667
I don't know what you
were trying to accomplish,

17:14.734 --> 17:17.433
but it didn't work at all. Goodbye.

17:17.500 --> 17:18.967
There's been a mistake.

17:19.033 --> 17:21.834
I had no idea what kind of place this was.

17:22.800 --> 17:26.600
-Ms. Devereaux, nice to see you again.
-Oh.

17:29.233 --> 17:33.100
(serene music playing)

17:40.233 --> 17:43.700
I'm stunned. I'm completely stunned.

17:43.767 --> 17:46.834
-Dorothy, what's wrong?
-How was Don's debut?

17:46.900 --> 17:48.667
A disaster.

17:49.166 --> 17:52.367
What can you say about a show
by an ex-fake Beatle

17:52.433 --> 17:54.367
that began with "I've Gotta Be Me"

17:54.433 --> 17:57.400
and ended with "Everybody Was
Kung Fu Fighting?"

17:58.700 --> 18:01.500
What the hell was that man doing up there?

18:02.800 --> 18:04.533
Was it as bad as that?

18:04.600 --> 18:06.867
Had it been a fight,
they would have stopped it.

18:08.166 --> 18:12.400
-Did he do any of his own material?
-He did his own material.

18:12.467 --> 18:14.200
A tribute to Dorothy...

18:14.667 --> 18:16.900
"Dot, dot, what a girl I got."

18:20.066 --> 18:23.700
The last words I heard
sprinting to my car were...

18:23.767 --> 18:26.834
"When we shower together,
we don't have to turn on hot."

18:29.567 --> 18:31.900
I just feel a little silly right now.

18:32.734 --> 18:35.133
Could I have transferred
my love for the Beatles

18:35.200 --> 18:38.200
to this one man who plays a Beatle?

18:38.567 --> 18:42.867
Could I have been so shallow
to have fallen in love with a persona

18:42.934 --> 18:44.700
and not the person?

18:44.767 --> 18:47.500
Oh, Ma. I need support now, please.

18:47.567 --> 18:51.166
I mean, no jokes, no "I told you sos."

18:51.233 --> 18:52.500
Of course not...

18:53.166 --> 18:54.166
dot.

18:57.133 --> 18:58.867
Dot, I've gotta trot.

19:00.333 --> 19:02.066
Hey, listen to me. I'm a Beatle.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.200
I am nothing but a cheap, tawdry slut.

19:11.200 --> 19:13.333
Don't tell me. Is it Blanche?

19:15.000 --> 19:18.667
(calm music playing)

19:19.000 --> 19:21.533
I really want to thank you for coming
over, Jerry.

19:22.667 --> 19:24.467
Actually, I wasn't going to, Blanche,

19:24.533 --> 19:27.233
but I figured this explanation's
got to be a pip.

19:30.633 --> 19:34.033
Explanation? No, no, no. None of those.

19:34.100 --> 19:40.433
I just wanted to apologize for tonight
and say I hope we can still be friends.

19:40.500 --> 19:41.834
Oh, sure, Blanche.

19:43.033 --> 19:44.734
But there's something I need to know.

19:46.467 --> 19:49.433
-Why don't you find me attractive?
-Are you kidding?

19:49.900 --> 19:52.567
You're one of the most attractive women
I've ever met.

19:53.033 --> 19:56.233
But five dates,
you haven't laid a finger on me.

19:56.300 --> 19:58.567
You haven't tried to sleep with me once.

20:00.033 --> 20:01.934
Sleep with you on the fifth date?

20:03.000 --> 20:05.467
Boy, talk about your fast track
in the nineties.

20:08.233 --> 20:10.066
Blanche, maybe I should explain
something to you.

20:10.133 --> 20:12.667
I dated my high school
sweetheart for years.

20:13.166 --> 20:14.667
We married right out of school.

20:14.734 --> 20:16.600
We were both virgins on our wedding night.

20:21.834 --> 20:24.233
I'm sorry.
I thought you were making a funny.

20:25.133 --> 20:28.333
I'm just frozen back in
the old days of courtship.

20:29.900 --> 20:32.266
Remember when we went
to the movies last week?

20:33.266 --> 20:36.500
You didn't say a word,
didn't try to kiss me good night.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.166
You looked so beautiful,

20:39.233 --> 20:42.200
I felt awkward and tongue-tied
like a teenager.

20:42.266 --> 20:43.633
I was afraid to kiss you.

20:43.700 --> 20:48.266
-Afraid of a little old kiss?
-Hey, to me a first kiss

20:48.333 --> 20:50.567
is still the sexiest thing in the world.

20:51.367 --> 20:52.700
Get out of here.

20:53.967 --> 20:55.133
Really.

20:55.834 --> 20:59.400
The way I look at it,
anyone can just jump into bed together.

20:59.934 --> 21:02.967
Me... I believe in romance...

21:03.667 --> 21:06.367
and that can start with something
as simple as...

21:07.233 --> 21:09.967
the sensitive stroking of someone's
hair...

21:11.367 --> 21:14.700
to the delicate caress of one's cheek...

21:15.967 --> 21:17.633
all leading up to one...

21:18.000 --> 21:21.266
warm... long... beautiful...

21:22.367 --> 21:24.967
anyway, that's what romance means to me.

21:26.200 --> 21:29.800
I can't imagine why so many people
have abandoned it.

21:29.867 --> 21:31.400
Boy, neither can I.

21:33.266 --> 21:40.133
-But if you just want to be friends...
-No, I mean, can we try again, start over?

21:41.400 --> 21:42.834
I think I'd like that.

21:44.567 --> 21:48.500
Well, I... better be off.
Good night, Blanche.

21:48.967 --> 21:50.200
Good night, Jerry.

22:06.767 --> 22:11.700
(soft music playing)

22:35.800 --> 22:36.800
(door closes)

22:40.000 --> 22:41.967
Blanche, what happened with Jerry?

22:43.367 --> 22:50.300
He said he wants to take things slow
and have an old-fashioned romance.

22:50.367 --> 22:51.734
Take things slow?

22:52.567 --> 22:55.767
An old-fashioned romance?
How does all this make you feel?

22:57.400 --> 22:58.633
Like a lady.

23:02.367 --> 23:07.667
(soft music playing)

23:11.734 --> 23:12.734
Hello, luv.

23:13.033 --> 23:16.533
-Dorothy isn't here, Don.
-Actually, I was looking for you.

23:17.200 --> 23:19.967
Do you want to have a spot of dinner
with me?

23:20.700 --> 23:23.367
I don't think so. I have a boyfriend.

23:23.433 --> 23:27.800
Oh. Did I mention Ernie's sick
and I'll be playing Paul this week?

23:30.400 --> 23:32.300
Well, maybe just some coffee.
