[engine stops]

04:09.814 --> 04:11.816
[Bartender] Another round?

04:14.993 --> 04:17.605
I really shouldn't.

04:19.041 --> 04:20.781
I'm not in the best headspace.

04:20.911 --> 04:23.263
What's wrong?

04:23.393 --> 04:26.962
I got a cabin
about an hour from here.

04:27.092 --> 04:31.488
I went out scavenging. Came home
to find it overrun by groaners.

04:31.619 --> 04:33.360
Came to the right place.

04:33.490 --> 04:37.799
We uh, got a guy here,
he does groaner work.

04:38.147 --> 04:40.105
Could maybe loan him out.

04:40.236 --> 04:43.674
Really?
Is he any good?

04:43.805 --> 04:47.243
He's the best I ever saw.

04:47.548 --> 04:49.941
So he's, like, based out of
here, lives at the motel?

04:50.072 --> 04:52.944
Generator needs a refill by now.

04:54.729 --> 04:57.949
Wh--where's the
little girl's room?

04:58.080 --> 05:01.039
Down the hall.
First on the left.

05:18.883 --> 05:22.582
[indistinct arguing]

05:33.637 --> 05:39.687
[shower running]

06:30.041 --> 06:32.435
You know, I had a hunch
you were up to something.

06:34.959 --> 06:37.614
[grunting]

06:41.183 --> 06:46.057
Let me guess, Vasquez from down
the road sent you here to snoop?

06:46.188 --> 06:49.234
Mm-mm-mm.

06:49.365 --> 06:51.193
Well...

06:51.323 --> 06:54.283
I've got a little message
for Vasquez.

06:56.067 --> 06:58.679
Hold her still.

07:01.246 --> 07:02.117
I reckon you're
gonna have trouble

07:02.247 --> 07:03.553
sniffing around after this.

07:05.729 --> 07:07.165
[loud effort]

07:07.296 --> 07:08.645
Ah!

07:11.779 --> 07:13.258
[screams]

07:22.006 --> 07:24.574
Ah!
Ugh...

07:43.637 --> 07:45.595
[Man] Hey! Where you going?

07:50.774 --> 07:52.210
Come here, baby.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.433
[engine starts]

08:24.547 --> 08:26.810
Sorry, thought you were better
on your feet.

08:26.941 --> 08:28.551
Good to see you, too.

08:36.472 --> 08:39.256
[Negan] Wanted by the
New Babylon Marshals.

08:39.388 --> 08:41.085
Well, goddamn.

08:41.216 --> 08:43.479
For a wanted man,
I look good.

08:44.828 --> 08:46.787
Can I keep this?

08:50.268 --> 08:52.096
I'm keeping this.

08:58.538 --> 09:01.105
Ginny. Hey, come here.

09:08.504 --> 09:10.811
You remember what I taught you?

09:13.465 --> 09:16.860
Where's Annie and your kid?

09:16.991 --> 09:19.123
Ginny, this here is Maggie.

09:19.254 --> 09:21.778
See, Maggie and I are...

09:22.953 --> 09:25.129
old acquaintances.

09:26.914 --> 09:30.439
So, you are either here
not to kill me,

09:30.570 --> 09:33.790
or you have gotten
seriously rusty.

09:34.965 --> 09:38.273
A few weeks back, I got raided.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.146
Outnumbered, overpowered,
stole all our grain.

09:44.322 --> 09:46.498
Said they'd be back
in a month for more.

09:47.108 --> 09:48.457
Then a month after that...

09:50.546 --> 09:52.548
took a hostage as collateral.

09:55.029 --> 09:57.074
They took your kid.

09:57.205 --> 09:58.380
I tracked them
all the way up the Hudson,

09:58.510 --> 10:00.730
by then they'd already
made it across.

10:01.470 --> 10:03.603
[Negan] Across to what?

10:03.733 --> 10:05.474
Manhattan.

10:07.955 --> 10:09.739
Hey...

10:10.131 --> 10:12.786
That is a really nice job.

10:12.916 --> 10:15.658
Will you do me a favor and
go finish checking on our shit?

10:15.789 --> 10:18.095
Thank you.

10:21.359 --> 10:24.275
I hate to even ask, but

10:24.406 --> 10:28.062
how do I figure into this,
Maggie?

10:28.192 --> 10:31.413
The man who's got Hershel,

10:31.543 --> 10:34.198
they call him the Croat.

10:36.766 --> 10:39.377
Bullshit. You know him.

10:39.508 --> 10:41.466
When he scaled our walls,

10:41.597 --> 10:44.731
had us surrounded in the dark,

10:44.861 --> 10:47.124
right before he took my son.

10:47.255 --> 10:49.213
Do you know what he did?

10:50.475 --> 10:54.828
[whistles one high tone,
one low tone]

10:55.655 --> 10:59.920
That rings a bell, doesn't it?
It did for me.

11:00.050 --> 11:03.924
That's the last thing I heard
before I met you.

11:04.054 --> 11:07.275
Oh, that Croat.

11:09.843 --> 11:12.497
All right, so what you're
thinking is,

11:12.628 --> 11:14.325
since I knew this guy
back in the day

11:14.456 --> 11:17.894
when I was running the show,

11:18.025 --> 11:21.332
that maybe I had some special
insight into his modus operandi.

11:21.463 --> 11:23.552
Or, hell, maybe I could just
sweet-talk him

11:23.683 --> 11:26.642
into giving you your boy back.

11:26.773 --> 11:30.820
We're talking about
the same Croat?

11:32.082 --> 11:34.389
Let's just say there were a lot
of psychos in my crew back then.

11:34.519 --> 11:36.086
But he always stood out as being

11:36.217 --> 11:39.481
an exceptionally insane
son of a bitch.

11:39.611 --> 11:41.744
So the odds are

11:41.875 --> 11:43.833
if it's the Croat
that's got him--

11:43.964 --> 11:46.923
No.

11:48.403 --> 11:50.665
All right, tell me this.

11:50.797 --> 11:53.234
Why would I help you?

11:53.364 --> 11:56.803
-Because you owe me--
-Because I owe you, right.

11:56.933 --> 11:59.936
You're the last person
that I wanted to ask for help.

12:01.024 --> 12:04.636
It doesn't look like you got
too many options yourself.

12:04.767 --> 12:08.379
Because if I found you here,
the marshals will too.

12:09.859 --> 12:13.210
Far as I can tell, you have
exhausted every shithole.

12:14.124 --> 12:17.258
Still got a decent setup
at Hilltop?

12:17.388 --> 12:20.217
Kids? School?

12:21.436 --> 12:24.221
I'll put up that girl.

12:24.352 --> 12:27.311
You, we see how things play out.

12:35.232 --> 12:37.321
Fair enough.

12:42.849 --> 12:46.809
[engine rumbling]

13:00.910 --> 13:05.915
[unsettling music]

13:22.453 --> 13:25.456
[Negan] Here, take this.
There you go.

13:48.566 --> 13:54.442
[walker growling]

14:31.305 --> 14:34.743
Hey. I don't recall this
being the way to Hilltop.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.701
It's because it isn't.

14:36.832 --> 14:38.355
That's not what we talked about,
Maggie.

14:38.486 --> 14:40.270
It's the same people,
same setup.

14:40.401 --> 14:43.970
Just had to relocate
after you help burn it down.

14:44.100 --> 14:46.450
If you recall that.

14:55.764 --> 14:58.332
[Negan] Here you go, kid.

15:12.868 --> 15:17.786
I was on the run, doing a stint
on a farm about a year ago.

15:17.917 --> 15:21.746
The marshals came poking around.
She asked to go with me.

15:25.315 --> 15:27.230
Why doesn't she talk?

15:27.361 --> 15:30.973
The tale the people
on the farm told,

15:31.104 --> 15:33.323
she was living with her dad.

15:33.454 --> 15:36.283
He took off one night,
didn't come back.

15:36.413 --> 15:39.373
She went looking for him.

15:39.503 --> 15:42.028
She found him.

15:42.419 --> 15:46.771
He, uh, he'd turned.

15:47.337 --> 15:49.861
It was bad.

15:50.775 --> 15:52.777
She could tell by looking at him
that it wasn't the dead.

15:52.908 --> 15:54.779
It wasn't an animal.

15:57.565 --> 16:01.003
It was a person or people.

16:01.134 --> 16:03.919
She just hasn't spoken since.

16:09.229 --> 16:11.535
It's me.

16:14.234 --> 16:20.283
[tense music]

16:20.414 --> 16:21.545
[brakes squealing]

16:37.126 --> 16:38.823
Marshals!

16:38.954 --> 16:40.564
What? Shit, put that away!
Put that away!

16:59.322 --> 17:01.585
-Check the rooms.
-Sorry. For sure.

17:09.637 --> 17:11.682
Have you seen this man?

17:13.989 --> 17:16.512
Goes by the name of Negan.

17:23.259 --> 17:25.957
The reason it's crucial
we find this man

17:26.088 --> 17:28.612
is because he's murdered
a magistrate in cold blood,

17:29.526 --> 17:32.486
along with four others.

17:32.877 --> 17:35.141
Which means under Code 14,
Section 2 of New Babylon law,

17:35.271 --> 17:38.057
he'll be executed.

17:38.187 --> 17:41.147
But not just executed.

17:41.277 --> 17:43.323
Nothing so magnanimous
as a hanging or beheading, no.

17:43.453 --> 17:45.107
For what this man has done,

17:45.238 --> 17:47.588
he'll be dangled upside down

17:47.718 --> 17:49.720
and sawed in half lengthwise

17:49.851 --> 17:52.158
from the groin to the head

17:52.288 --> 17:56.771
very, very slowly.

17:56.901 --> 18:00.122
This is a man who's
built up an empire

18:00.253 --> 18:02.168
like a greedy king.

18:02.298 --> 18:05.475
Story goes, he once lined up
a group of unarmed folks

18:05.606 --> 18:09.566
and he bashed in a man's head
with a baseball bat

18:11.742 --> 18:14.571
in front of the man's
pregnant wife.

18:20.055 --> 18:23.363
Tranquillitas ordinis.

18:23.493 --> 18:28.237
Tranquility, order,
justice, the law.

18:28.368 --> 18:30.935
That's what keeps our
Federation of States at peace.

18:31.066 --> 18:35.462
Safe, stable.

18:42.730 --> 18:45.602
I'm going to ask you
one last time,

18:45.733 --> 18:48.257
have you seen this man?

18:58.615 --> 19:00.400
Alright, then.

19:02.489 --> 19:04.839
Liquor, drugs,
gambling, whoredom,

19:04.969 --> 19:07.015
all prohibited under Code 19,

19:07.146 --> 19:09.539
together amounting
to a public execution.

19:09.670 --> 19:11.106
Damnit, you're breaking my arm!

19:11.237 --> 19:14.370
I am.
You're very perceptive.

19:14.501 --> 19:16.764
[walkers growling]

19:16.894 --> 19:18.026
Okay. Yes. Yeah, Yeah.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.854
Yeah, no, I did see him.
I did see him.

19:19.984 --> 19:22.683
He-- he's-- he worked here.
He killed the walkers.

19:22.813 --> 19:24.815
-Someone took him. A woman.
-A woman?

19:24.946 --> 19:27.035
Yeah. I-- I'd never seen her
before today.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.037
-Where'd she take him?
-I don't know.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.431
-She drove off in a car!
-Describe the car.

19:31.561 --> 19:32.910
I don't know!

19:33.041 --> 19:34.825
[Woman] It was a blue truck
parked out front.

19:34.956 --> 19:36.262
That's it! That's it!
I swear! I swear!

19:36.392 --> 19:38.046
That's it, I swear!

19:42.181 --> 19:45.401
See.
That's all you needed to say.

19:45.532 --> 19:47.055
The truth.

19:47.186 --> 19:50.450
-And yet, Code 14, Section 8.
-What?

19:50.580 --> 19:52.408
Aiding and abetting.

19:53.104 --> 19:55.237
Ah! No!

19:55.368 --> 19:59.763
[walkers growling]

20:12.776 --> 20:15.910
I promise you something.

20:16.040 --> 20:19.261
Alright? I will come back
for you soon.

20:19.392 --> 20:20.480
'Kay?

20:20.610 --> 20:23.178
[Maggie] It's getting late.

20:37.497 --> 20:39.977
You be good.

21:02.652 --> 21:05.133
They're going to
take care of her, right?

21:05.264 --> 21:08.310
They're gonna--
Good people?

21:12.227 --> 21:14.534
That's how it's going to be?

21:14.664 --> 21:16.275
Unless you want the law
catching up with you.

21:21.628 --> 21:25.022
[walkers growling]

21:27.764 --> 21:29.723
So it's her, huh?

21:29.853 --> 21:31.377
Same woman's been
looking for him

21:31.507 --> 21:33.030
and leaving all those
broken bones behind.

21:33.161 --> 21:34.597
Hey.

21:34.728 --> 21:38.558
What I did back there
wasn't 'cause I wanted to.

21:38.688 --> 21:39.733
It had to be done.

21:40.647 --> 21:42.649
[walkers growling]

22:05.628 --> 22:07.587
[Jano] What is it?

22:16.422 --> 22:22.210
[sinister music]

22:43.449 --> 22:44.188
Mom!

22:44.319 --> 22:46.016
Hershel!

23:02.119 --> 23:04.383
[clears throat]

23:09.562 --> 23:15.437
Hell, when I was a kid, my pop,
he went on a business trip

23:15.568 --> 23:18.266
or some shit to New York City,
and he brought me back this

23:18.397 --> 23:23.924
little souvenir of the
Statue of Liberty.

23:24.054 --> 23:27.884
I remember, I just couldn't
imagine how something so small

23:28.015 --> 23:32.193
could also be so giant.
You know?

23:32.323 --> 23:35.762
So, anyway, Pop, he, uh...

23:35.892 --> 23:40.810
He promises he's going to take
me in to see the real thing and

23:40.941 --> 23:45.598
makes a whole plan, you know,
picked a weekend and

23:45.728 --> 23:49.297
train tickets, the whole nine.

23:49.428 --> 23:52.909
And as generally was
the case with my dad...

23:55.216 --> 23:58.088
...something came up, I guess.

24:01.048 --> 24:05.008
Anyway, I still haven't seen
Lady Liberty in the flesh.

24:11.232 --> 24:14.365
All right, so how's this whole
operation supposed to lay out?

24:14.496 --> 24:16.542
I mean, besides the part
where I charm my old pal

24:16.672 --> 24:19.893
into giving you your kid back?

24:20.023 --> 24:21.677
I got a plan.

24:21.808 --> 24:24.375
Ah, top secret, huh?

24:24.506 --> 24:28.118
I am on a need-to-know basis,
I guess.

24:28.249 --> 24:31.121
That's cool, you don't trust me.

24:31.252 --> 24:35.474
Hell,
I wouldn't trust me either.

24:36.344 --> 24:39.782
You see, I got what I wanted.
Ginny is safe.

24:39.913 --> 24:45.745
She is comfortable.
I could kill you right now.

24:45.875 --> 24:47.964
You could try.

24:48.095 --> 24:49.313
But then I'd have to
kill you first.

24:49.444 --> 24:53.404
