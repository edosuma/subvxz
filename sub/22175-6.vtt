- And everything you've done

01:59.018 --> 02:01.187

- What year did you

02:02.922 --> 02:05.225
start tattooing?
- I started tattooing in '67.

02:05.291 --> 02:07.360
- What was tattooing
like at that point?

02:07.427 --> 02:08.627
- Well,
it was just very limited.

02:08.695 --> 02:10.229
I think there were about
500 tattooers

02:10.295 --> 02:11.664

North America, right?

02:11.731 --> 02:13.032

different world.

02:17.537 --> 02:19.205

that I got into it early enough

02:19.272 --> 02:21.107

02:24.377 --> 02:26.212

I'm from West Oakland.

03:57.303 --> 03:59.238
I didn't have a lot.
I always been a artist

myself out of my situation,

04:02.141 --> 04:04.510
so I started airbrushing.
Somebody stole my car.

04:04.577 --> 04:06.079
My airbrushing
equipment was in there.

04:06.145 --> 04:08.581
Had nowhere else to turn to
to make money as a artist.

04:08.648 --> 04:11.284
One of my boys
bought me my first kit.

- So you don't think
tattooing is a real job?

but at the same time,

report for anybody.

{\an1}and I want it to embody
power and strength.

29:57.629 --> 30:01.733
{\an1}Being gay in a community
that didn't accept it,

30:01.799 --> 30:03.334

{\an3}- How hard was it

don't know what intersex is.

30:32.697 --> 30:36.334
{\an3}It's a person that was born

30:36.401 --> 30:37.936
{\an3}A lot of people
that are intersex,

30:38.002 --> 30:40.638
{\an3}either they don't find out
about their identity

30:40.705 --> 30:43.041
or they find out,
and they're upset

30:43.107 --> 30:45.677
{\an3}about not having the choice
to choose their gender.

30:45.743 --> 30:47.812
I found out when I was 33.

30:47.879 --> 30:49.781
{\an3}My mom told me
once my dad died.

30:49.847 --> 30:52.183
{\an3}That was really hard,
to come to the identity

30:52.250 --> 30:54.852
{\an3}as an intersex person
at such a late age.

30:54.919 --> 30:56.688
{\an1}- Do you think that your life
has changed drastically

30:56.754 --> 30:58.556
since you found out?

30:58.623 --> 31:00.825
{\an3}- For sure.
I became, like, a sex educator,

31:00.892 --> 31:02.560
because I wanted to know more

31:02.627 --> 31:04.495
about the different
bodies that exist,

31:04.562 --> 31:06.130
{\an3}and I also wanted to teach
young people

31:06.197 --> 31:08.132
about what is possible.

31:08.199 --> 31:09.867
{\an1}- Thank you for being so
inspiring.

31:09.934 --> 31:11.769
- Thank you.
- So what would you like

31:11.836 --> 31:13.238
to get tattooed today?

31:13.304 --> 31:15.373
{\an3}- I would like a tattoo
of something

31:15.440 --> 31:17.575

blended genders.

31:17.642 --> 31:20.345

both genders,

31:20.411 --> 31:22.180
and transitioning bodies.

31:22.247 --> 31:23.748

31:23.815 --> 31:27.952
isn't a physical thing
as much as a concept.

31:28.019 --> 31:29.821
<i>So my job is to figure out</i>

31:29.887 --> 31:33.358

<i>ideas come to life.</i>

31:33.424 --> 31:35.660
This design is
going to be difficult.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.028

of what I came up with.

31:37.095 --> 31:39.163

31:39.230 --> 31:41.065

31:42.867 --> 31:44.836

31:44.902 --> 31:46.437

in it,

31:46.504 --> 31:47.939
you can see the strength.

31:48.006 --> 31:50.008

31:52.744 --> 31:54.912

- I've been working on this.

31:54.979 --> 31:57.181
To represent both genders,

31:57.248 --> 32:00.118
we're going to have
two sets of arms

32:00.184 --> 32:02.887

different sides to you.

32:02.954 --> 32:05.189
