WEBVTT

00:18.625 --> 00:20.458
- This is it.
- Yeah.

00:20.500 --> 00:23.083
Hopefully this is
the right Alejandro Diaz.

00:23.166 --> 00:25.458
Yeah, I don't want
to hug another stranger.

00:26.458 --> 00:27.666
Here we go.

00:31.458 --> 00:34.125
Mom!

00:34.166 --> 00:35.541
We found you.

00:35.625 --> 00:36.791
What are you doing here?

00:36.875 --> 00:38.500
Camila, it's okay.

00:38.583 --> 00:39.583
Who is it?

00:45.958 --> 00:47.958
Oh.

00:59.958 --> 01:03.250
Welcome, little Alejandro.

01:17.333 --> 01:20.916
If someone adopts you,
tell them to adopt me too.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.125
I'll be a good brother.
What do you say?

01:24.958 --> 01:26.583
Alejandro. Keep moving.

01:26.666 --> 01:28.458
More babies need to be held.

01:45.958 --> 01:46.958
What are you doing?

01:47.458 --> 01:50.291
Seeing if this spot
would feel good to a flower.

01:50.375 --> 01:52.083
Ah.

01:52.166 --> 01:53.083
Does it?

01:53.166 --> 01:54.375
I think so.

01:55.125 --> 01:56.750
Hmm.

01:56.875 --> 01:58.875
There's a baby in there.

01:59.750 --> 02:00.916
That's right.

02:04.291 --> 02:06.791
This one is only for you.

02:07.500 --> 02:09.125
Take good care of it.

02:09.166 --> 02:10.750
Thank you!

02:21.583 --> 02:23.583
Are you sure about this job?

02:24.333 --> 02:26.666
I always thought you would
want to work with children.

02:26.750 --> 02:28.583
You're such a sweet boy.

02:29.125 --> 02:31.041
The pay is good,
and they provide housing.

02:31.125 --> 02:32.625
Also, please...

02:32.708 --> 02:37.291
don't tell the other guys in the
oil field that I'm a sweet boy.

02:40.125 --> 02:41.916
Okay. I won't.

02:48.958 --> 02:50.291
Good luck, Ale.

02:50.833 --> 02:51.833
We'll miss you.

03:50.708 --> 03:52.625
Hello?

03:54.208 --> 03:56.583
Hello? Who is this?

03:56.666 --> 03:58.583
I'm...

03:58.666 --> 03:59.916
I'm Alejandro.

04:01.458 --> 04:02.833
I'm your son.

04:06.833 --> 04:10.166
If it's weird, I get it.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.875
I can hang up right now.

04:11.958 --> 04:13.083
I know it's weird...

04:13.166 --> 04:15.541
No, please.

04:16.958 --> 04:21.875
I just thought my information,
that it was sealed.

04:21.958 --> 04:24.708
I unsealed it.

04:24.791 --> 04:26.500
Sorry if...

04:26.583 --> 04:27.958
No.

04:28.750 --> 04:31.083
I'm glad you found me.

04:32.583 --> 04:33.583
You are?

04:34.583 --> 04:35.625
Yes.

04:36.875 --> 04:38.291
I'm just surprised.

04:39.583 --> 04:40.583
Right.

04:46.625 --> 04:50.208
I'll be in Mexico soon
to visit my family.

04:51.250 --> 04:54.166
I'd like to meet you.
If you'd like that.

04:55.833 --> 04:57.916
I'd like that.

05:32.208 --> 05:34.125
It's good to...

05:34.208 --> 05:35.208
meet you?

05:37.000 --> 05:38.916
You're so...

05:40.041 --> 05:41.125
grown up.

05:42.250 --> 05:43.250
Come in.

05:47.875 --> 05:49.583
I bought you some cookies.

05:49.666 --> 05:50.625
Thank you.

05:50.708 --> 05:52.000
Sit.

05:56.125 --> 05:57.041
Your room is nice.

05:57.125 --> 05:58.250
Sí...

05:58.333 --> 06:00.000
It's good not having
all those pesky walls

06:00.083 --> 06:01.541
breaking up the space.

06:01.625 --> 06:03.208
They just get in the way.

06:04.500 --> 06:07.000
You joke around
like my daughter, Alma.

06:07.083 --> 06:08.291
I have a sister?

06:08.375 --> 06:09.458
Two, actually.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.041
Alma and Becca.

06:12.125 --> 06:14.166
I always wanted to be a brother.

06:17.041 --> 06:18.916
Wow, they're so cute.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.083
If it's okay,

06:20.166 --> 06:22.041
I'd like to meet them someday.

06:23.166 --> 06:25.875
Someday. Maybe.

06:27.500 --> 06:28.541
Are you all right?

06:28.625 --> 06:29.541
Yeah.

06:29.625 --> 06:31.083
There's just a lot of dust.

06:31.666 --> 06:33.625
This job doesn't seem very safe.

06:34.875 --> 06:36.916
Have you thought about
something else?

06:37.708 --> 06:39.666
I heard computers pay well.

06:39.750 --> 06:41.500
I could pay for training.

06:41.583 --> 06:44.291
Thank you, but you don't
need to do anything for me.

06:44.375 --> 06:45.375
That's not why...

06:45.458 --> 06:46.458
I'd like to.

06:47.250 --> 06:49.125
It's something I can do.

06:50.166 --> 06:51.166
I'll think about it.

06:52.875 --> 06:54.875
You can take the whole tin,
if you want.

06:57.083 --> 07:00.375
I will take the tin,
but I'll leave you the cookies.

07:00.458 --> 07:01.916
And then next time,

07:02.000 --> 07:06.375
I'll come back with the tin full
of something homemade for you.

07:07.125 --> 07:08.375
How does that sound?

07:08.458 --> 07:09.458
That sounds nice.

07:21.916 --> 07:23.541
-Hello?
-Alejandro?

07:24.916 --> 07:25.958
It's me.

07:26.041 --> 07:28.125
I'm glad you called.

07:28.208 --> 07:30.375
I can't wait to show you
my new apartment.

07:30.458 --> 07:31.750
It has so many walls.

07:31.833 --> 07:33.000
You're going to love it.

07:33.083 --> 07:36.250
It's great that the new job
is working out.

07:37.875 --> 07:39.208
Listen...

07:40.375 --> 07:42.750
I can't call you
from my house anymore,

07:42.833 --> 07:46.208
and you can't call me.

07:47.041 --> 07:48.583
Do you understand?

07:50.041 --> 07:51.625
Is everything okay?

07:52.291 --> 07:56.375
My husband asked
about my calls to you,

07:56.458 --> 08:01.458
and I can't explain it to him
right now, so...

08:01.541 --> 08:04.625
Oh, okay...

08:04.708 --> 08:06.083
I understand.

08:10.375 --> 08:12.250
Happy birthday,
my love.

08:12.333 --> 08:15.333
I hope this year is fantastic.

08:15.416 --> 08:16.958
Merry Christmas.

08:17.041 --> 08:19.583
May the holiday spirit
be with you.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.083
Happy birthday.

08:21.166 --> 08:24.166
- I hope you have another
wonderful year.

08:27.166 --> 08:28.083
You made it!

08:28.166 --> 08:29.166
Come in.

08:32.916 --> 08:35.291
I'm sorry it took so long.

08:35.416 --> 08:37.541
I do want to visit more often.

08:37.625 --> 08:39.583
I made you cookies.

08:39.666 --> 08:41.083
You remembered.

08:41.166 --> 08:42.083
Yes.

08:42.166 --> 08:43.083
Happy birthday.

08:43.166 --> 08:44.083
Merry Christmas.

08:44.166 --> 08:45.250
Happy birthday.

08:47.416 --> 08:48.666
I hope you like brownies.

08:49.791 --> 08:51.666
I'm glad you could make it.

08:53.041 --> 08:54.541
- Feliz navidad...
cumpleaños...

08:54.625 --> 08:56.666
navidad... cumpleaños...

09:00.500 --> 09:02.666
I've never made peppermint
bark before...

09:07.500 --> 09:09.291
You're warm.

09:09.375 --> 09:11.458
Yeah.
They think it's bronchitis.

09:11.541 --> 09:14.375
I feel like you've had
this cough for years now.

09:15.458 --> 09:17.208
- I know.
- So when

09:17.291 --> 09:20.916
are you going to get a wife
to take care of you?

09:22.791 --> 09:24.541
I don't know.

09:24.625 --> 09:25.708
Maybe never.

09:25.791 --> 09:27.041
Never?

09:27.125 --> 09:28.125
Why not?

09:31.000 --> 09:34.291
I'm not... interested in women.

09:36.250 --> 09:38.250
Ah.

09:39.791 --> 09:41.416
Men?

09:48.416 --> 09:49.958
Then a husband?

09:51.500 --> 09:53.000
I don't know...

09:53.083 --> 09:55.000
I'm pretty shy
about relationships.

09:55.083 --> 09:56.291
Why?

09:56.375 --> 09:57.875
You're so wonderful.

09:57.958 --> 10:01.666
I want to be my best self when
I approach someone seriously.

10:02.833 --> 10:05.333
I think you're perfect
right now.

10:06.833 --> 10:09.500
Thank you.

10:09.583 --> 10:11.416
But if I were your son...

10:11.500 --> 10:12.708
You are my son.

10:14.083 --> 10:17.125
If people knew I was your son,

10:17.208 --> 10:20.208
would it be so easy
to accept me?

10:20.291 --> 10:21.583
Yes.

10:21.666 --> 10:22.583
Of course.

10:22.666 --> 10:25.375
I would be proud.

10:28.083 --> 10:30.208
I am proud.

10:42.708 --> 10:44.500
I left you messages and emailed.

10:44.583 --> 10:45.583
I'm in town.

10:45.666 --> 10:48.375
Actually I'm...
outside your house.

11:01.458 --> 11:04.291
Alejandro, I'm sorry,
but you cannot

11:04.375 --> 11:07.416
just show up to my house
like this.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.958
I'm in town for a work
conference.

11:10.041 --> 11:11.458
I just wanted to see you.

11:11.541 --> 11:15.083
I've been busy
with Becca's wedding.

11:15.166 --> 11:17.375
The whole family is here.

11:17.458 --> 11:20.333
I haven't had time. I'm sorry.

11:20.416 --> 11:23.041
I know this is complicated
for you.

11:23.125 --> 11:26.291
But I need to talk to you.

11:26.375 --> 11:28.333
What is it? What's going on?

11:28.416 --> 11:30.583
They found scarring in my lungs.

11:31.625 --> 11:34.833
From the silica dust-- when
I worked in the oil fields.

11:35.916 --> 11:37.791
They want to remove lung tissue.

11:40.500 --> 11:43.416
I should have gotten you
out of that job earlier.

11:44.375 --> 11:46.291
Could you come and stay with me?

11:46.375 --> 11:47.875
Help me?

11:51.583 --> 11:54.500
It's difficult for me
to get away right now.

11:56.458 --> 11:58.083
Yeah.

11:58.166 --> 11:59.250
Okay.

12:01.791 --> 12:03.333
That's my daughter.

12:03.416 --> 12:04.875
Please, you have to go.

12:04.958 --> 12:05.875
Can I meet her?

12:05.958 --> 12:06.958
Not now.

12:07.041 --> 12:08.083
She just got married.

12:08.166 --> 12:09.666
I can't surprise her like this.

12:09.750 --> 12:12.041
Just admit it,
you're ashamed of me.

12:12.125 --> 12:14.291
No! That's not it.

12:14.375 --> 12:15.875
I'm ashamed of me.

12:15.958 --> 12:17.333
I'm ashamed of what I did.

12:17.416 --> 12:20.958
This thing you did-- it's me.

12:24.333 --> 12:26.708
I'll send money for the surgery.

12:26.791 --> 12:28.250
I'm sorry.

12:32.500 --> 12:34.416
Becca,
what are you doing here?

12:34.500 --> 12:36.416
- No, Alejandro.

12:36.500 --> 12:38.250
You need to go. Now!

13:04.458 --> 13:07.666
I brought you some things.

13:07.750 --> 13:09.541
Why did you change your mind?

13:09.625 --> 13:10.833
You ask so little of me,

13:10.916 --> 13:13.125
and my family asks so much...

13:13.208 --> 13:16.375
You shouldn't
have to go through this alone.

13:17.416 --> 13:19.291
I panicked.

13:19.375 --> 13:20.958
Please forgive me.

13:24.666 --> 13:27.583
- Okay.
- Okay.

13:34.791 --> 13:36.125
Here.

13:37.708 --> 13:39.666
Thank you for being here.

13:39.750 --> 13:41.625
I'm happy to be here.

13:51.625 --> 13:53.791
- Mom!
- We found you.

13:53.875 --> 13:55.458
What are you
doing here?

13:55.541 --> 13:57.041
Camila, it's okay.

13:57.083 --> 13:58.125
Who is it?

14:04.458 --> 14:06.458
Oh.

14:24.916 --> 14:26.541
Hey, you okay?

14:26.625 --> 14:28.708
What is going on?
Why are you here?

14:28.791 --> 14:30.916
We tried calling you.
You didn't answer.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.625
But it's okay.

14:32.708 --> 14:35.125
It's all gonna be better now
because we know everything.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.583
This is the worst time.

14:36.666 --> 14:38.125
No, this is okay.

14:38.208 --> 14:39.541
Hi, I'm Alma.

14:39.625 --> 14:41.208
I am your favorite sister.

14:41.291 --> 14:43.583
- How are you?
- Hi, I'm Alejandro.

14:43.666 --> 14:46.458
I'm your only brother...
that we know of.

14:46.541 --> 14:48.791
- Got you, Mom.
- Please.

14:48.875 --> 14:51.291
Eh, come in...
Please, come in.

14:53.791 --> 14:54.916
I'll make tea.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.750
No, no, you rest.

14:56.833 --> 14:57.750
I'll make the tea.

14:57.833 --> 14:59.333
Okay. Thank you.

14:59.416 --> 15:01.750
Alejandro,
we're so excited to meet you...

15:01.833 --> 15:04.000
I wish you'd told me about this.

15:05.041 --> 15:06.750
I'm sorry you felt
that you couldn't.

15:11.125 --> 15:13.291
Did you just hear me apologize?

15:13.375 --> 15:15.458
I can't talk about this
right now.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.458
I take it that's not weed, huh?

15:18.541 --> 15:21.166
It's medicine for the lungs.

15:21.250 --> 15:22.208
So it is weed.

15:25.791 --> 15:27.250
Oh, my God.

15:27.333 --> 15:29.125
I am so sorry
for making you laugh.

15:29.208 --> 15:30.958
It's really hard for me
not to be this hilarious.

15:31.041 --> 15:32.458
You'll learn that about me.

15:32.541 --> 15:34.541
- It's okay.
- So, Mom?

15:35.833 --> 15:37.916
How come you never
told us about Alejandro?

15:41.833 --> 15:45.250
I... I... couldn't.

15:47.791 --> 15:49.833
I was young.

15:49.916 --> 15:51.833
My mother already disowned me.

15:51.916 --> 15:53.708
I had nothing.

15:53.791 --> 15:56.041
How could I take care of a baby?

15:56.125 --> 15:59.833
I felt when I lost you...

15:59.916 --> 16:03.166
I lost half of myself.

16:03.250 --> 16:05.500
I tried once

16:05.583 --> 16:08.333
to put the two halves
of me together.

16:08.416 --> 16:11.916
I thought once I was
pregnant with Alma,

16:12.000 --> 16:15.250
you would be okay
with another child.

16:15.333 --> 16:17.375
With my son.

16:17.458 --> 16:20.333
I even went to get
the paperwork.

16:20.416 --> 16:22.666
I gave you a plant that day.

16:23.541 --> 16:26.666
This one is only for you.

16:26.750 --> 16:28.291
Take good care of it.

16:28.375 --> 16:29.916
Thank you!

16:30.000 --> 16:31.916
I was going to show you
the papers.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.958
I was going
to tell you everything.

16:34.041 --> 16:35.875
But I...

16:35.958 --> 16:37.958
couldn't.

16:40.750 --> 16:41.750
That was you.

16:45.291 --> 16:48.666
You came,
and you didn't take me.

16:50.541 --> 16:52.041
Why?

16:52.125 --> 16:56.000
What can we do about the past?

16:57.333 --> 16:58.875
It's not important anymore.

16:58.958 --> 17:00.958
It's not important?

17:04.500 --> 17:06.000
This is my life.

17:08.958 --> 17:11.291
Everything could have
been different,

17:11.375 --> 17:13.416
and you won't tell me why.

17:14.791 --> 17:17.625
- Are you all right?

17:17.708 --> 17:19.041
Calm.

17:20.166 --> 17:21.166
Calm.

17:22.458 --> 17:23.375
I need you to go.

17:23.458 --> 17:24.458
Okay.

17:24.541 --> 17:25.916
Alejandro needs you to leave.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.250
- He needs to rest.
- No.

17:31.083 --> 17:32.291
I don't want you here.

17:33.875 --> 17:40.125
I'm tired of being
what you're hiding--

17:40.208 --> 17:44.666
what you can't let
be part of your life.

17:44.750 --> 17:46.416
No, I want to stay.

17:47.541 --> 17:48.666
I'll bring the tea.

17:48.750 --> 17:50.458
I'll get it.

17:50.541 --> 17:51.541
Please...

17:54.833 --> 17:56.500
...just leave.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.000
Okay.

18:26.208 --> 18:28.041
How could you
do this?

18:28.125 --> 18:30.333
How could you invade
my privacy like this?

18:30.416 --> 18:32.041
What happened
to make you change your mind

18:32.125 --> 18:33.500
about adopting Alejandro?

18:33.583 --> 18:34.875
Alma, stop.

18:34.958 --> 18:36.875
I didn't want
to complicate your lives.

18:36.958 --> 18:38.833
I didn't want
to burden our family.

18:38.916 --> 18:41.416
I did it for you.

18:41.500 --> 18:44.416
To be a good mother
and-and wife to you.

18:44.500 --> 18:45.750
So this is our fault?

18:45.833 --> 18:47.791
But you never even
gave us a chance.

18:47.875 --> 18:50.208
You never
talked to me about this.

18:50.291 --> 18:52.958
Your mother told me
it was a mistake.

18:56.833 --> 18:59.916
That I shouldn't burden
my family with my past.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.458
That I needed to leave
that version of me behind.

19:18.750 --> 19:21.083
- ...for our family,
I was wrong.
- Becca.

19:21.166 --> 19:22.791
- I don't know
what you want me to say.
- The door, it just appeared.

19:22.875 --> 19:24.875
It's got to mean something.

19:24.958 --> 19:27.125
- You talked to my mother
about this?
- We were close.

19:27.208 --> 19:30.708
She was a mother to me when
my own mother refused to be.

19:30.791 --> 19:32.958
- I trusted her.
- But you didn't
trust me.

19:33.041 --> 19:34.916
When did this happen?
When were you close

19:35.000 --> 19:38.166
- with Geraldine?
- I used to visit her
in the mental hospital.

19:38.250 --> 19:40.250
And that's when she told you
not to adopt Alejandro?

19:40.333 --> 19:41.916
I hoped he would have
a better life.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.166
That he would be adopted.

19:45.250 --> 19:47.208
You think it's easy
to be wrong about this?

19:47.291 --> 19:49.125
Stop it.

19:50.166 --> 19:51.541
I'm sorry.

19:51.625 --> 19:54.166
I'm sorry it all happened
like this.

19:54.250 --> 19:56.583
Camila, please, don't walk away.

19:56.666 --> 19:59.291
What are you doing?

19:59.375 --> 20:01.416
Why didn't you go
into Mom's memory?

20:01.500 --> 20:03.875
Because searching around
is just making it worse.

20:03.958 --> 20:06.250
We know about our brother.
How is this worse?

20:06.333 --> 20:08.333
He doesn't want anything
to do with us.

20:08.416 --> 20:10.375
And we've wrecked
his relationship with Mom.

20:10.458 --> 20:12.083
And Mom and Dad
won't stop fighting.

20:12.166 --> 20:13.958
Don't you see
what's happening around you?

20:14.041 --> 20:15.958
When Mom was talking about
Geraldine, that door appeared

20:16.041 --> 20:17.500
in front
of Alejandro's apartment,

20:17.583 --> 20:19.083
and I heard
the crying child again.

20:19.166 --> 20:20.916
- Crying child?
- Yes.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.041
Behind the door,
there is a crying child,

20:23.125 --> 20:24.583
And I believe that's Alejandro.

20:24.666 --> 20:26.125
This feels insane.

20:26.208 --> 20:27.583
What if all we have to do
is go back

20:27.666 --> 20:29.125
and stop Geraldine
from telling Mom

20:29.208 --> 20:30.416
not to adopt Alejandro?

20:30.500 --> 20:32.250
There's no way it's that simple.

20:32.333 --> 20:34.250
Can we just give it a shot?
I mean, what do we have to lose?

20:34.333 --> 20:35.875
You have nothing to lose.

20:35.958 --> 20:37.875
I'm the one
that collapsed doing this.

20:37.958 --> 20:39.291
Just try and get us there.

20:39.375 --> 20:40.958
I can fix this.
I've done it before.

20:41.041 --> 20:42.625
Yeah, you know,
speaking of that,

20:42.708 --> 20:45.000
what is this other life
that you and Dad changed?

20:45.083 --> 20:46.750
- I can't talk about that.
- Oh.

20:46.833 --> 20:48.541
- Mm-hmm.
- He told me not to.

20:48.625 --> 20:51.125
Will you just trust me?

20:51.208 --> 20:54.500
You want to go on some quest
to be the big family hero?

20:54.583 --> 20:56.875
Then, fine.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.416
Mm-hmm.

21:10.875 --> 21:12.916
Becca...

21:13.000 --> 21:15.333
you accessed Mom's memory
without her even here.

21:15.416 --> 21:17.083
Come on.

21:17.166 --> 21:19.166
I'm not going.

21:20.916 --> 21:23.125
Then I'll do it myself.

21:23.208 --> 21:25.250
Good luck.

21:39.083 --> 21:40.333
Count Ten

21:44.750 --> 21:47.208
Wait, this is...

21:47.291 --> 21:49.833
don't come around...

21:49.916 --> 21:52.166
Becca?!

21:52.250 --> 21:54.583
Becca, come back.

21:54.666 --> 21:56.583
You sent me to the wrong time.

21:56.666 --> 21:58.375
Hey!

21:58.458 --> 22:00.166
You need to calm down.

22:02.625 --> 22:04.291
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
No, no, no, no, no, no

22:04.375 --> 22:06.041
no, no, no, no, no, no.
You don't understand.

22:06.125 --> 22:07.625
I'm not supposed
to be here, sir.

22:07.708 --> 22:09.750
Sure. Never heard that before.

22:09.833 --> 22:11.000
No, no, no!

22:13.000 --> 22:14.916
No, no, no, no, no,
wait, wait, wait!

22:17.125 --> 22:19.125
- No!

22:19.208 --> 22:20.791
Becca!

22:20.875 --> 22:22.541
Fuck!
