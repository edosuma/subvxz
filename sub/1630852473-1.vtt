ANNOUNCER 1: <i>Remain seated, please.</i>

00:04.212 --> 00:06.506
(in Spanish)
<i>Please remain seated.</i>

00:06.589 --> 00:08.591
(lively music)

00:11.469 --> 00:12.721
(elephants trumpeting)

00:18.893 --> 00:20.228
MAN 1: <i>The love of liberty.</i>

00:20.770 --> 00:21.771
(moans)

00:21.855 --> 00:23.064
(screaming)

00:34.909 --> 00:37.746
NARRATOR:
<i>The desert of Southern California.</i>

00:38.705 --> 00:41.541
<i>A harsh, barren expanse of dryness</i>

00:42.709 --> 00:45.879
<i>with nothing more
than the moisture of oranges,</i>

00:46.004 --> 00:48.089
-(creaking)
<i>-which are actually quite juicy.</i>

00:49.215 --> 00:54.429
<i>But in the 1950s,
here in the brutal California sun,</i>

00:54.512 --> 00:57.474
<i>an idea trickled out of the sand.</i>

00:58.141 --> 01:00.935
<i>An idea that quickly turned
into a torrent,</i>

01:01.019 --> 01:03.772
<i>which quickly turned
into a flowing tropical river.</i>

01:03.855 --> 01:05.940
MAN 2: <i>We'll leave the last
outpost of civilization,</i>

01:06.024 --> 01:08.109
<i>push off into the upper reaches
of the Amazon.</i>

01:08.193 --> 01:09.277
NARRATOR: <i>And the Jungle Cruise</i>

01:09.360 --> 01:13.198
<i>has been putting these tropical waters
for nearly 70 years,</i>

01:13.281 --> 01:18.661
<i>recreating the majesty of elephants,
hippos, crocodiles, giraffes,</i>

01:18.745 --> 01:24.334
<i>piranhas, lions, rhinos, apes,
exotic plants, boulders, and...</i>

01:24.959 --> 01:26.002
<i>rocks?</i>

01:26.086 --> 01:27.545
(laughs)

01:27.629 --> 01:29.464
-All right.
-NARRATOR: <i>Yep, there he is.</i>

01:29.547 --> 01:32.258
<i>Saving the world with Emily Blunt
in a movie</i>

01:32.342 --> 01:36.262
<i>inspired by one of the most
enduring attractions at Disneyland.</i>

01:36.346 --> 01:37.347
I am not afraid.

01:37.430 --> 01:38.640
NARRATOR: <i>And why would you be?</i>

01:38.723 --> 01:42.602
<i>Disney's Jungle Cruise
is revered for its team of skippers</i>

01:42.685 --> 01:44.771
<i>who deliver razor-sharp witticisms...</i>

01:44.854 --> 01:46.898
I'd like to point out
some plant life to you.

01:50.902 --> 01:52.487
NARRATOR: <i>...and highbrow humor...</i>

01:52.570 --> 01:54.614
Feel free to take as many photos
as you like.

01:54.697 --> 01:56.157
They all got their trunks on...

01:56.241 --> 01:57.826
NARRATOR: <i>...or otherwise known as...</i>

01:57.909 --> 01:58.868
Dad jokes.

01:58.952 --> 01:59.953
I love a good pun.

02:00.036 --> 02:01.371
We're in denial.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.123
NARRATOR: <i>But most of all,</i>

02:03.206 --> 02:08.002
<i>the Jungle Cruise is classic,
vintage Disneyland at its best.</i>

02:08.419 --> 02:10.547
<i>But before we climb aboard to find out</i>

02:10.630 --> 02:15.635
<i>how on earth a humid tropical ecosystem
ended up in Southern California...</i>

02:15.718 --> 02:19.681
MAN 3: <i>Yes, a visit by boat to remote,
adventurous regions of the world.</i>

02:19.764 --> 02:22.350
NARRATOR: <i>...and other Disney Parks
around the world...</i>

02:22.517 --> 02:24.310
(fire crackles)

02:24.394 --> 02:28.231
<i>...we need to go back to the dry desert
of the early 1950s</i>

02:28.314 --> 02:32.819
<i>where a chap named Walter Elias Disney
was gaining a bit of a reputation</i>

02:32.902 --> 02:34.237
<i>as an animal man.</i>

02:34.320 --> 02:35.321
Hi, Minnie!

02:35.405 --> 02:37.949
NARRATOR: <i>Not so much
the cute, animated kind.</i>

02:38.032 --> 02:39.701
<i>No. Cute, little bunny.</i>

02:39.784 --> 02:43.079
<i>We're talking about animals
with real killer instincts,</i>

02:43.163 --> 02:47.167
<i>ones that don't ever wear
either jackets or pants.</i>

02:47.250 --> 02:50.712
<i>That's right, our story begins
with Walt's love of animals</i>

02:50.795 --> 02:52.672
<i>in all shapes and sizes.</i>

02:53.047 --> 02:57.719
<i>And this fascination grew
when he ran a successful cartoon studio</i>

02:57.802 --> 03:00.555
<i>and was striving for animation perfection.</i>

03:00.638 --> 03:03.308
We knew that to retain
the charm of these creatures,

03:03.391 --> 03:06.352
our animated drawings must fully capture
the natural movements

03:06.436 --> 03:08.438
and attitudes of living animals.

03:08.521 --> 03:10.982
WALT: <i>So, we've studied motion pictures
of wild animals</i>

03:11.065 --> 03:12.650
<i>living in their natural state.</i>

03:13.443 --> 03:17.906
<i>And, in time, we added many reels
of wildlife scenes to our Bambi research.</i>

03:17.989 --> 03:19.157
NARRATOR: <i>And in doing this,</i>

03:19.240 --> 03:23.244
<i>Walt not only discovered
how to build better Bambis,</i>

03:23.828 --> 03:28.458
<i>he also, like a creature of the wild,
wasn't one to waste scraps,</i>

03:28.541 --> 03:30.543
<i>especially scraps of good footage.</i>

03:30.627 --> 03:34.422
One thing has always led to another here
and Bambi was no exception.

03:35.381 --> 03:39.928
The wildlife scenes in this research
yielded an unexpected dividend.

03:40.011 --> 03:44.432
NARRATOR: <i>That being many forms
of potential wildlife documentaries.</i>

03:44.515 --> 03:50.230
It was all about enjoying the grandeur,
and appreciating nature and real animals.

03:50.313 --> 03:53.483
NARRATOR: <i>Which is when Walt realized
that he could quite easily become...</i>

03:53.566 --> 03:58.071
A live action movie producer. And so,
he makes his first True-Life Adventure.

03:58.154 --> 04:00.198
NARRATOR: <i>Using this location footage,</i>

04:00.281 --> 04:03.493
<i>Walt was able to make
a documentary featurette.</i>

04:03.576 --> 04:05.286
<i>-Signed, sealed...</i>
-(barks)

04:05.370 --> 04:07.705
It's a story about Seal Island.

04:07.789 --> 04:08.957
NARRATOR: <i>...and delivered.</i>

04:09.040 --> 04:14.295
It becomes eligible for the Academy Award,
wins best short documentary,

04:14.379 --> 04:17.423
and that was the start
of 13 <i>True-Life Adventures,</i>

04:17.507 --> 04:19.342
8 of which won Academy Awards.

04:19.425 --> 04:20.551
NARRATOR: <i>Yes, it's true.</i>

04:20.635 --> 04:23.721
<i>Walt had more tuxedos
than a colony of penguins.</i>

04:23.972 --> 04:25.807
<i>They're always dressed so formally.</i>

04:25.890 --> 04:29.143
<i>And with that,
Walt Disney's reputation was sealed,</i>

04:29.227 --> 04:32.313
<i>as not just an Oscar-winning
animated filmmaker,</i>

04:32.397 --> 04:35.650
<i>but as a legitimate
wildlife documentarian.</i>

04:36.442 --> 04:37.777
(dings)

04:38.152 --> 04:41.489
<i>But Walt was looking
to break the seal-ing...</i>

04:41.572 --> 04:42.615
<i>No, that one doesn't work.</i>

04:42.907 --> 04:46.035
<i>...with another True-Life Adventure
he'd been working on at home...</i>

04:47.328 --> 04:48.454
<i>Parenthood.</i>

04:48.538 --> 04:51.374
It all started from a daddy
with two daughters...

04:51.457 --> 04:52.875
-(bicycle bell dings)
-<i>...wondering where he could take them</i>

04:52.959 --> 04:54.919
<i>where he could have a little fun
with them too.</i>

04:55.003 --> 04:57.297
There's a very famous story about him
going to Griffith Park

04:57.380 --> 04:59.632
and having his Daddy's Day
with the daughters.

04:59.716 --> 05:02.719
Walt was sitting on the bench,
feeding nuts to the squirrels

05:02.802 --> 05:04.470
and watching his girls ride the carousel.

05:04.554 --> 05:07.515
I felt that
there should be something built,

05:07.598 --> 05:10.018
some kind of, uh,
an amusement enterprise built

05:10.101 --> 05:14.188
where the parents and the children
could have fun together.

05:14.272 --> 05:16.107
NARRATOR: <i>And we all know
what this idea turned out to be.</i>

05:16.190 --> 05:18.026
WALT: That's it. Right here.

05:18.401 --> 05:19.610
Disneyland.

05:19.694 --> 05:22.155
NARRATOR: <i>And from the very first sketch
of Disneyland,</i>

05:22.238 --> 05:24.741
<i>to almost every single one since,</i>

05:24.824 --> 05:29.996
<i>Walt's incredible vision for the park
contained an exotic, jungle-laden river</i>

05:30.079 --> 05:32.206
<i>that twisted and turned across the map.</i>

05:32.290 --> 05:34.542
The reason why he created Jungle Cruise

05:34.625 --> 05:37.837
was because he wanted to create
an experience for people

05:37.920 --> 05:40.631
<i>who weren't able to travel the globe
at that time,</i>

05:40.715 --> 05:43.384
<i>and bring other parts of the world
to the people.</i>

05:43.468 --> 05:45.511
-Yes.
-He loved this idea

05:45.595 --> 05:49.891
of almost like a travelogue of all these,
you know, exotic waterways of the world

05:49.974 --> 05:53.102
that he could take his guests through
and show them something really good.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.312
NARRATOR: <i>And keep in mind,</i>

05:54.395 --> 05:58.858
<i>international travel to exotic
destinations wasn't so easy back then.</i>

05:58.941 --> 06:00.193
Very few people went to Africa.

06:00.276 --> 06:03.154
Very few people even saw
what hippos were like in the water.

06:03.529 --> 06:05.698
NARRATOR: <i>Uh, graceful, obviously?</i>

06:05.782 --> 06:08.868
<i>However, up until 1954,</i>

06:08.951 --> 06:12.663
<i>there was nothing but big talk
coming out of Walt Disney's mouth</i>

06:12.747 --> 06:14.290
<i>because, at this point,</i>

06:14.374 --> 06:18.336
<i>all Walt had was a basic premise
for an exotic boat ride,</i>

06:18.419 --> 06:24.133
<i>just one year to construct Disneyland,
and a very dry location to do it in.</i>

06:24.217 --> 06:28.513
We get an average rainfall
of 12 to 14 inches, and that's a desert.

06:28.805 --> 06:32.392
NARRATOR: <i>But the Walt Disney Company
was overflowing with talent.</i>

06:32.475 --> 06:36.729
<i>So, Walt turned to one guy
who had a particular talent with wetness.</i>

06:37.271 --> 06:40.525
If you look at Harper Goff's designs
for Walt,

06:40.608 --> 06:43.486
the Nautilus
for <i>20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,</i>

06:43.569 --> 06:46.239
<i>he was a very prolific designer.</i>

06:46.322 --> 06:48.783
Harper was one of the first Imagineers.

06:48.866 --> 06:50.910
He created the earliest concepts

06:50.993 --> 06:53.955
for what would become known
as the Jungle Cruise.

06:54.038 --> 06:56.249
NARRATOR:
<i>But Harper didn't draw inspiration</i>

06:56.332 --> 06:57.875
<i>from the depths of the ocean...</i>

06:57.959 --> 07:02.088
I've seen <i>The African Queen</i>
and I liked it.

07:02.880 --> 07:04.757
NARRATOR: <i>He saw a lot of potential</i>

07:04.841 --> 07:08.803
<i>in a movie about a crusty skipper
with questionable hygiene</i>

07:08.886 --> 07:11.931
<i>putting along the Ulanga River
in East Africa</i>

07:12.014 --> 07:16.894
<i>with its inherent sights, dangers,
and bathing opportunities along the way.</i>

07:17.478 --> 07:20.690
<i>So,</i> The African Queen <i>was a good place
to start.</i>

07:20.773 --> 07:24.235
<i>Emphasis on start
because before they could get here,</i>

07:24.569 --> 07:28.030
<i>they had to physically start here
or maybe there.</i>

07:28.865 --> 07:33.244
<i>Well, they needed to work it out fast,
so Walt assembled his team</i>

07:33.327 --> 07:36.831
<i>and shared the details
of his vision for Jungle Cruise.</i>

07:36.914 --> 07:39.959
BILL: <i>Walt, he'd take you
on that cruise verbally,</i>

07:40.042 --> 07:41.502
<i>and he'd really get into it.</i>

07:41.586 --> 07:48.009
Then his artist would try to visualize
what they heard him say,

07:48.092 --> 07:52.430
<i>and we'd mold this down into
where it came out as a drawing on paper.</i>

07:52.513 --> 07:55.933
NARRATOR: <i>And what they ended up with
was a sprawling cruise</i>

07:56.309 --> 07:59.729
<i>that not only floated down
the rivers of Eastern Africa</i>

07:59.812 --> 08:02.106
<i>but, you know,
all the jungles of the world.</i>

08:02.190 --> 08:06.444
We have things from the South Pacific,
we have things from Africa,

08:06.527 --> 08:09.363
we have things
from many different parts of the world.

08:09.447 --> 08:12.742
NARRATOR: <i>All a world away from Anaheim,
but not for long</i>

08:12.825 --> 08:15.077
<i>because when construction began
for Disneyland...</i>

08:15.161 --> 08:19.582
The bulldozer shows up,
ready to dig the trench for the river.

08:19.665 --> 08:23.127
NARRATOR: <i>To direct the bulldozers poised
to carve a jungle river</i>

08:23.211 --> 08:24.837
<i>in the bone-dry dirt,</i>

08:24.921 --> 08:28.049
<i>Harper Goff used the precision
of 1950s technology.</i>

08:28.132 --> 08:30.051
Harper Goff picks up a stick

08:30.134 --> 08:34.138
and he traces the entire outline
of one bank of the river,

08:34.222 --> 08:35.389
and then when he's completed,

08:35.473 --> 08:37.433
he goes about 10, 15 feet
to the other side

08:37.517 --> 08:39.894
and does the other bank of the river,

08:39.977 --> 08:42.396
<i>and has the bulldozer
start digging up from there.</i>

08:42.480 --> 08:45.483
NARRATOR: <i>And the legacy
of Harper Goff's powerful stick...</i>

08:45.566 --> 08:46.609
<i>Not actual stick.</i>

08:46.692 --> 08:48.319
<i>...can still be seen today.</i>

08:48.402 --> 08:52.406
And, of course, the Jungle Cruise was,
you know, obviously a big job,

08:52.490 --> 08:55.243
because we're bringing a jungle
into a farmland.

08:55.326 --> 08:57.703
NARRATOR:
<i>An overwhelming task, to be sure.</i>

08:57.787 --> 08:59.539
<i>So, for this worldly challenge,</i>

08:59.622 --> 09:04.085
<i>Walt scoured the lengths and breadths
of his backyard, actually,</i>

09:04.168 --> 09:07.046
<i>where he found
the landscape architect Bill Evans</i>

09:07.129 --> 09:12.843
<i>who had helped Walt landscape a man-sized
toy train set for his own house.</i>

09:12.927 --> 09:14.804
<i>Uh, don't worry. It's on a loop.
He'll be back.</i>

09:15.221 --> 09:19.892
<i>And now, it was full steam ahead
on a much bigger project.</i>

09:19.976 --> 09:22.186
DAVID: <i>Bill Evans, who was
our landscape architect, of course,</i>

09:22.270 --> 09:26.232
his job was to fill Disneyland in
with as much landscape as possible.

09:26.315 --> 09:29.193
This was kind of an on-the-job training.

09:29.860 --> 09:31.862
BILL: <i>A lot of these things
hadn't been done before.</i>

09:33.155 --> 09:35.866
NARRATOR: <i>Spinning their wheels,
there was no time to waste.</i>

09:36.450 --> 09:39.370
Jungle Cruise was the first attraction
that they really started to break...

09:39.453 --> 09:40.580
-NARRATOR: <i>The seal?</i>
-(seal barks)

09:40.663 --> 09:42.164
-...ground for.
-<i>Right, sure.</i>

09:42.248 --> 09:44.333
KEVIN: <i>They started with
the Jungle Cruise a little bit earlier</i>

09:44.417 --> 09:47.169
<i>to get an extra growing season in
for all the trees.</i>

09:47.253 --> 09:48.629
MICHAEL: <i>Great effort was made
to make sure</i>

09:48.713 --> 09:50.047
that the area around Adventureland

09:50.131 --> 09:53.259
was planted early and densely
so that you'd have this backdrop

09:53.342 --> 09:55.553
<i>for the Adventureland stories
that we wanted to tell.</i>

09:55.636 --> 09:58.598
But trees take time. I mean,
it's something you can't fake or force.

09:58.681 --> 09:59.682
NARRATOR: <i>But, of course,</i>

09:59.765 --> 10:01.892
<i>they weren't starting completely
from scratch.</i>

10:01.976 --> 10:06.022
PAULA: <i>They wanted to save as much
of the original trees as they could</i>

10:06.105 --> 10:07.898
<i>because the more that they saved,</i>

10:07.982 --> 10:10.860
the more they didn't have to go out
and buy and bring in.

10:10.943 --> 10:13.154
NARRATOR:
<i>In a flurry of colorful conservation...</i>

10:13.237 --> 10:15.573
TIM: <i>They had tagged
the trees to save green,</i>

10:15.656 --> 10:17.033
<i>and the ones to bulldoze red.</i>

10:17.116 --> 10:18.159
NARRATOR: <i>But, of course...</i>

10:18.242 --> 10:21.078
The bulldoze operator was color-blind.

10:21.162 --> 10:24.790
And he indiscriminately went through
and bulldozed everything.

10:24.874 --> 10:28.836
NARRATOR: <i>Well, in his defense,
it's all in black and white, so...</i>

10:28.919 --> 10:32.590
<i>But, one way or another,
Bill desperately needed trees.</i>

10:32.673 --> 10:35.301
He would go around
the different neighborhoods of Anaheim

10:35.384 --> 10:36.510
<i>and in California,</i>

10:36.594 --> 10:39.680
<i>buying people's trees,
buying their exotic plants,</i>

10:39.764 --> 10:40.723
<i>just to bring them in.</i>

10:40.806 --> 10:44.435
NARRATOR: <i>And one of those trees
even became a minor celebrity</i>

10:44.518 --> 10:46.479
<i>known as the Dominguez Palm.</i>

10:46.562 --> 10:51.651
The palm tree was given to my grandparents
as a wedding gift.

10:51.734 --> 10:54.403
NARRATOR: <i>So, when Walt
bought the property for Disneyland,</i>

10:54.487 --> 10:57.239
<i>he knew the tree had sentimental roots.</i>

10:57.323 --> 10:59.825
Walt promised them
that we'd take good care of it,

10:59.909 --> 11:03.037
and we brought it from over where it was
out in the parking lot

11:03.120 --> 11:04.246
and planted it here.

11:04.330 --> 11:08.501
RON: <i>It was in the Jungle Cruise
attraction, and they moved it.</i>

11:09.210 --> 11:14.215
It got moved a second time on expansion
and placed in the queue line.

11:14.298 --> 11:16.300
(tranquil music)

11:16.384 --> 11:19.178
RON: <i>I can stand back in Adventureland
and see it.</i>

11:19.804 --> 11:20.971
Yeah, it's a big tree.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.891
NARRATOR: <i>Well, that's one down... or up?</i>

11:23.974 --> 11:28.020
<i>But, as for the rest,
Bill was desperate so he began scouring</i>

11:28.104 --> 11:30.815
<i>the newly constructed freeway systems
of Southern California.</i>

11:30.898 --> 11:32.733
They were planning to run Interstate 5

11:32.817 --> 11:35.319
right past where, you know,
the plot that they picked.

11:35.403 --> 11:38.364
NARRATOR: <i>Bill would even stoop
to roadkill of sorts.</i>

11:38.447 --> 11:42.535
The freeways,
which were penetrating the suburbs

11:42.618 --> 11:44.829
around the Los Angeles area,

11:44.912 --> 11:48.374
uh, made possible the salvage
of a lot of trees

11:48.457 --> 11:50.418
<i>that we could not otherwise have found.</i>

11:50.501 --> 11:54.004
BILL: <i>And we literally snatched them
from the jaws of the bulldozer.</i>

11:54.088 --> 11:56.799
<i>We got there the day before
they were to be demolished.</i>

11:57.341 --> 12:01.262
<i>Box them out,
haul them down to Disneyland.</i>

12:01.762 --> 12:03.931
Now, I could tell you
tree after tree, you know,

12:04.014 --> 12:06.767
<i>this was Santa Monica Freeway,
that was at Pomona Freeway.</i>

12:08.144 --> 12:09.603
NARRATOR: <i>But making one jungle</i>

12:09.687 --> 12:12.773
<i>out of the building scraps
of the urban jungle,</i>

12:12.857 --> 12:14.233
<i>well, even that wasn't enough.</i>

12:14.316 --> 12:19.155
Bill would travel all over
jungles of the world

12:19.238 --> 12:22.658
<i>to collect seeds
to plant this incredible jungle.</i>

12:22.742 --> 12:25.578
NARRATOR:
<i>And the most exotic tree of them all,</i>

12:25.661 --> 12:31.542
<i>famous for its rare,
sweet fruit and luscious nectar.</i>

12:31.625 --> 12:33.085
<i>Yep, oranges.</i>

12:33.169 --> 12:37.047
Some of the orange trees that were saved
ended up in the Jungle Cruise.

12:37.131 --> 12:38.507
And they were planted upside down

12:38.591 --> 12:42.052
because the roots look like
some kind of exotic tree,

12:42.136 --> 12:45.347
and they provided some
of the shrubbery for the Jungle Cruise.

12:45.431 --> 12:48.309
NARRATOR: <i>Of course,
the shrubbery was merely the backdrop</i>

12:48.392 --> 12:52.855
<i>to an exotic animal-filled river
yet to be filled.</i>

12:52.938 --> 12:56.609
Here's a guy driving a Rambler
station wagon around a ditch

12:56.692 --> 12:58.903
and says,
"This is gonna be the Jungle Cruise."

12:59.570 --> 13:00.613
Hey, how's it going?

13:00.696 --> 13:03.157
"And you're gonna have the lions
jumping out over here."

13:03.240 --> 13:04.241
(lion roars)

13:04.325 --> 13:05.701
"And if you look over
at that pile of dirt,

13:05.785 --> 13:06.952
that's gonna be a bunch of hyenas."

13:07.036 --> 13:09.622
NARRATOR: <i>With a bit of imagination,
you might say...</i>

13:09.705 --> 13:11.165
"Wow, that's really cool," you know?

13:11.248 --> 13:14.210
NARRATOR:
<i>But as for the actual lions and hyenas,</i>

13:14.293 --> 13:15.503
<i>where would they come from?</i>

13:15.586 --> 13:18.506
<i>The I-5 South, like the trees did?
Chances were slim.</i>

13:18.589 --> 13:22.343
Walt did originally wanna have
real animals in the Jungle Cruise.

13:22.426 --> 13:24.261
NARRATOR:
<i>Well, that's an exciting prospect.</i>

13:24.345 --> 13:26.472
VANESSA: <i>It was quickly discovered that...</i>

13:26.555 --> 13:27.765
(goat bleats)

13:27.848 --> 13:31.018
...that would lead to
a not-very-exciting trip for our guests.

13:31.101 --> 13:33.062
NARRATOR: <i>Because, despite
what you may have heard,</i>

13:33.145 --> 13:35.689
<i>the lion doesn't always sleep at night.</i>

13:35.773 --> 13:38.025
Animals like to sleep a lot
during the day.

13:38.108 --> 13:40.820
KEVIN: <i>How do you get them to stay outside
so people can see them?</i>

13:40.903 --> 13:43.823
NARRATOR: <i>It's a question
that really only had one solution.</i>

13:43.906 --> 13:47.701
They realized that they needed
to make artificial animals,

13:47.785 --> 13:51.705
and that would be the way that you could
have hippos in front of you all the time.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.959
NARRATOR: <i>Making enough hippos
and artificial animals</i>

13:55.042 --> 13:56.669
<i>to fill a jungle and river?</i>

13:56.752 --> 13:58.671
<i>Well, that had never been done before.</i>

13:58.754 --> 14:01.966
<i>They were inventing this technology
from the ground up,</i>

14:02.049 --> 14:03.801
<i>minus the actual ground.</i>

14:03.884 --> 14:08.013
<i>However, Walt did have a bit of a leg up,
eight legs in fact.</i>

14:08.264 --> 14:10.349
Our work with three-dimensional
characters started

14:10.432 --> 14:14.311
when we needed a giant squid
for our feature picture,

14:14.395 --> 14:16.272
<i>20,000 Leagues Under The Sea.</i>

14:16.355 --> 14:18.816
NARRATOR:
<i>Hitting the screens in late 1954,</i>

14:18.899 --> 14:21.151
<i>the movie was a cinematic triumph.</i>

14:21.235 --> 14:28.242
<i>So, once again, out came the tuxedos
and Walt won two more Oscars in 1955.</i>

14:28.826 --> 14:32.121
<i>The timing of which
worked out pretty well for Walt</i>

14:32.204 --> 14:36.000
<i>and the now-unemployed
Oscar-winning special effects crew.</i>

14:36.083 --> 14:37.501
BRUCE: <i>All the special effects folks</i>

14:37.585 --> 14:41.088
that had been doing
the mechanical effects for motion pictures

14:41.171 --> 14:45.467
were recruited to create live animals
for the Jungle Cruise.

14:45.551 --> 14:48.596
NARRATOR:
<i>But cutting-edge technology in 1955</i>

14:48.679 --> 14:50.848
<i>was a little bit different
than it is today.</i>

14:50.931 --> 14:53.392
WALT: <i>Many new plastic materials
came to our aid</i>

14:53.475 --> 14:55.269
<i>in the creation of the jungle beasts.</i>

14:55.352 --> 14:58.314
LANNY: <i>The first robots in the parks
compared to the Animatronics</i>

14:58.397 --> 14:59.690
<i>that we have in the parks now...</i>

15:00.900 --> 15:02.359
are very primitive.

15:02.443 --> 15:05.029
NARRATOR: <i>Well, they were making primates,
but still.</i>

15:05.112 --> 15:07.448
Well, they were definitely mechanical,

15:07.531 --> 15:10.576
and you could see the joints
of their faces and jaws.

15:10.659 --> 15:11.702
NARRATOR: <i>And here's why.</i>

15:11.785 --> 15:14.079
Animatronics were hydraulic.

15:14.163 --> 15:17.917
A hydraulic means that
they had oil in them under high pressure

15:18.000 --> 15:19.919
that moved the joints
and that sort of thing.

15:20.002 --> 15:22.546
NARRATOR:
<i>And, like many high-pressure situations,</i>

15:22.630 --> 15:25.799
<i>sometimes, it helps to hide behind a bush.</i>

15:25.883 --> 15:30.262
And rhinoceroses could be...
the rhinoceri, I guess it is,

15:30.346 --> 15:33.599
could be behind the brush,
and the giraffe could...

15:33.682 --> 15:35.017
<i>even though he doesn't have his legs,</i>

15:35.100 --> 15:37.394
<i>he could be eating
the tip-tops of the trees.</i>

15:37.478 --> 15:40.147
WALT:
<i>Towering above them all, the giraffe.</i>

15:40.773 --> 15:43.567
<i>And it's pretty hard to tell him
from our mechanical version.</i>

15:43.651 --> 15:47.029
NARRATOR: <i>Depending on which angle
you're seeing him from, of course.</i>

15:47.112 --> 15:49.740
<i>But not every animal
could lurk in the shrubs.</i>

15:49.823 --> 15:54.828
The most sophisticated animation
that was in there were the hippos.

15:54.912 --> 15:56.830
We knew that the animals couldn't walk.

15:56.914 --> 15:59.583
'Cause we... They were...
had to be attached to something.

15:59.667 --> 16:03.462
NARRATOR: <i>So, to work that out,
these moviemakers went back to the studio.</i>

16:03.545 --> 16:04.838
WALT: <i>On the tank stage we had built</i>

16:04.922 --> 16:07.758
<i>for the submarine
in</i> 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,

16:07.841 --> 16:10.052
<i>our monorail system went underwater.</i>

16:10.135 --> 16:12.179
NARRATOR:
<i>And to keep the whole illusion intact,</i>

16:12.262 --> 16:16.934
<i>the water is actually dyed
a lovely shade of murky green</i>

16:17.017 --> 16:19.019
<i>to hide the assortment of mechanics,</i>

16:19.103 --> 16:22.940
<i>because those adorable,
authentic ears don't wiggle themselves.</i>

16:23.023 --> 16:26.485
<i>But any shortcomings the wild beasts
had in looks</i>

16:26.568 --> 16:29.363
<i>were more than made up for
by the way they sounded,</i>

16:29.446 --> 16:31.615
<i>as Walt Disney himself found out.</i>

16:31.699 --> 16:33.117
(trumpets)

16:33.200 --> 16:37.705
Walt Disney had spent so much time
with the park, he'd like to sleep there.

16:37.788 --> 16:41.792
JOHN: <i>And the first time he tried it,
no one could find the switch</i>

16:41.875 --> 16:45.004
-to turn off all the jungle noises.
-(monkey gibbers)

16:45.087 --> 16:48.215
And he complained about
that he couldn't sleep.

16:48.298 --> 16:50.551
He had to get up and stay up all night

16:50.634 --> 16:54.138
because it was just as bad
as being in a real jungle.

16:54.221 --> 16:55.514
NARRATOR: <i>This map is a reminder</i>

16:55.597 --> 16:58.100
<i>of just how well
the Jungle Cruise is hidden,</i>

16:58.183 --> 17:02.563
<i>because here is Walt's apartment,
and here's the Jungle Cruise,</i>

17:02.646 --> 17:06.817
<i>right when you walk in the park
and directly behind a sleeping Walt.</i>

17:06.900 --> 17:07.776
(elephant trumpets)

17:07.860 --> 17:09.111
NARRATOR: <i>It's also worth noting</i>

17:09.194 --> 17:12.322
<i>that Walt's apartment
is above the firehouse, so...</i>

17:13.157 --> 17:15.868
<i>Anyway, Walt would soon rest easy</i>

17:15.951 --> 17:19.288
<i>because opening day at Disneyland
was fast approaching.</i>

17:19.371 --> 17:22.666
Just a matter of days away
from the formal opening of Disneyland,

17:22.750 --> 17:25.210
we want to bring you up to date
on what's been happening

17:25.294 --> 17:30.299
and let you share with us the joys
and anxieties of our race against time.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.634
NARRATOR: <i>The jungle
had been growing for a year,</i>

17:32.718 --> 17:34.678
<i>so all the plants were coming along.</i>

17:34.762 --> 17:38.390
<i>The river was partially filled,
and the boats were going on their tracks.</i>

17:38.474 --> 17:41.769
<i>And, of course, Walt Disney
was on the maiden test voyage.</i>

17:41.852 --> 17:44.354
It was like the world's biggest toy
for the world's biggest kid.

17:44.438 --> 17:47.274
KEVIN: <i>And the Jungle Cruise was just like
a really cool action figure set</i>

17:47.357 --> 17:48.484
<i>you can go play inside.</i>

17:48.567 --> 17:49.985
NARRATOR: <i>Hmm. Nice waterfall.</i>

17:50.069 --> 17:52.446
<i>But, wait a minute,
where are all the animals?</i>

17:52.529 --> 17:55.574
They're still installing
the electromechanical animals

17:55.657 --> 17:56.575
that are over there.

17:57.701 --> 18:00.621
TODD: <i>And so, he knows
that this is down to the wire.</i>

18:00.996 --> 18:06.919
The big concern on July 17th
is that it looks good for the TV audience.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.755
NARRATOR:
<i>And this TV audience was important</i>

18:09.838 --> 18:11.590
<i>because the whole success of the park</i>

18:11.673 --> 18:14.927
<i>hinged on making a very good
first impression.</i>

18:15.010 --> 18:17.805
<i>So, with millions and millions
of people watching...</i>

18:17.888 --> 18:20.557
The pressure
has got to be unbelievable on him.

18:20.641 --> 18:21.892
NARRATOR: <i>Because, don't forget,</i>

18:21.975 --> 18:26.939
<i>Walt wasn't just building a jungle river
in an officially classified desert,</i>

18:27.022 --> 18:29.775
<i>he was also building a castle,
flying elephants,</i>

18:29.858 --> 18:31.735
<i>pretend flying pirate ships,</i>

18:31.819 --> 18:34.279
<i>a working steamboat,
little cars that drive about,</i>

18:34.363 --> 18:35.906
<i>all in a year.</i>

18:35.989 --> 18:37.366
<i>So, understandably...</i>

18:37.449 --> 18:41.286
Everybody is telling you,
"What in the hell are you thinking?"

18:42.162 --> 18:43.247
NARRATOR: <i>This, of course. </i>

18:43.330 --> 18:48.710
<i>And when the drawbridge
finally came down on July 17th, 1955,</i>

18:48.794 --> 18:51.338
<i>these broadcasting pioneers with their...</i>

18:51.421 --> 18:53.924
Twenty-nine cameras, dozens of crews.

18:54.007 --> 18:55.300
-NARRATOR: <i>...and one...</i>
-REPORTER 1: <i>Ronnie Reagan.</i>

18:55.384 --> 18:56.885
NARRATOR: <i>...saved the best for last.</i>

18:56.969 --> 18:59.263
Well, Walt, it seems to me
we've been everywhere, haven't we?

18:59.346 --> 19:01.348
Well, I hope so. I don't know.

19:01.431 --> 19:02.975
Say, haven't we missed something?

19:03.350 --> 19:04.518
Seems like it.

19:04.601 --> 19:05.769
A whole land?

19:06.311 --> 19:07.396
Adventureland.

19:07.479 --> 19:09.565
Oh, that's my favorite.
Let's go over there.

19:09.815 --> 19:12.067
And we are now at the beginning
of a true-life adventure...

19:12.151 --> 19:14.486
NARRATOR: <i>That's right,
a true-life adventure.</i>

19:14.570 --> 19:16.488
<i>Maybe the greatest one of all.</i>

19:16.572 --> 19:19.032
RONALD: <i>Now, we're all loaded up,
I believe. Thank you, Captain.</i>

19:19.116 --> 19:19.992
<i>You can take her off.</i>

19:20.075 --> 19:24.413
<i>We're ready for a ride
down the tropical waterways of the world.</i>

19:25.831 --> 19:29.126
<i>Now, you just can't believe it, folks.
The colors are so unbelievable.</i>

19:29.209 --> 19:32.004
<i>The banks are lined with rare trees
and exotic foliage</i>

19:32.087 --> 19:34.047
<i>flown here from the far corners
of the earth.</i>

19:34.131 --> 19:38.218
NARRATOR: <i>And the banks of the I-5 south.
But it worked, big-time!</i>

19:38.302 --> 19:42.097
The live TV broadcast
of Disneyland's grand opening on ABC

19:42.181 --> 19:46.560
<i>attracted an audience
of about 90 million people.</i>

19:46.643 --> 19:51.690
TIM: <i>It was the largest live TV spectacle
up to that point.</i>

19:52.316 --> 19:53.317
<i>That's pretty remarkable,</i>

19:53.400 --> 19:59.198
<i>considering the overall population
of the United States was only 170 million.</i>

19:59.281 --> 20:03.660
Those audiences are people
just like them, the spectators are them.

20:03.744 --> 20:07.122
PAULA:
<i>They're seeing themselves being there.</i>

20:07.206 --> 20:10.417
<i>That's what that opening broadcast does,</i>

20:10.500 --> 20:14.922
is it puts you in the place
where you want to be.

20:15.088 --> 20:16.381
(children cheer)

20:16.465 --> 20:19.259
NARRATOR: <i>And that opening day broadcast
at Disneyland,</i>

20:19.343 --> 20:21.136
<i>as awkward as it was...</i>

20:23.513 --> 20:27.768
<i>showed that Walt Disney had created
something absolutely incredible.</i>

20:27.851 --> 20:30.646
<i>And, after just one crazy year of work,</i>

20:30.729 --> 20:35.525
<i>an exotic river now flowed through
the arid Anaheim landscape,</i>

20:35.609 --> 20:38.111
<i>and Walt could finally get
a good night's sleep.</i>

20:38.278 --> 20:39.738
(animals roaring)

20:39.821 --> 20:41.365
NARRATOR: <i>And get ready for day two.</i>

20:44.201 --> 20:47.704
<i>In the coming weeks,
Disneyland was the hottest ticket in town.</i>

20:47.788 --> 20:51.250
<i>And word had spread
about the exotic Jungle Cruise.</i>

20:51.333 --> 20:54.378
<i>And, like the documentary series
it drew inspiration from,</i>

20:54.461 --> 20:59.383
<i>the Jungle Cruise was filled
with exotic animals and interesting facts,</i>

20:59.466 --> 21:02.427
<i>as told by non-robotic human skippers</i>

21:02.511 --> 21:05.347
<i>who navigated the waters
of the Jungle Cruise,</i>

21:05.430 --> 21:09.643
<i>as well doing their spiel
to about 30 excited guests per boat.</i>

21:09.726 --> 21:12.354
Steady, folks.
Watch those ripples up ahead.

21:12.437 --> 21:16.024
NARRATOR: <i>Well, for the skippers, they
were more on the lookout for the boss,</i>

21:16.108 --> 21:19.069
<i>because Walt would often come aboard
and rock the boat.</i>

21:19.152 --> 21:21.238
Walt went on to the Jungle Cruise,

21:21.321 --> 21:23.365
the skipper was kind of nervous, very...

21:23.448 --> 21:24.950
because he had Walt Disney in his boat.

21:25.033 --> 21:26.493
Oh, hi, Walt.

21:26.576 --> 21:28.620
He took the boat at a record pace.

21:28.704 --> 21:32.207
KEVIN: <i>He flew through the jungle,
full throttle, for the entire thing.</i>

21:32.791 --> 21:34.876
And he called me over and he said,
"Dick, what's the trip time?"

21:34.960 --> 21:37.296
And he knew, in those days,
it was seven and a half minutes.

21:37.379 --> 21:39.339
DICK: <i>And he said,
"Well, I just got a four-minute trip."</i>

21:39.423 --> 21:40.382
Hope you all enjoyed it.

21:40.465 --> 21:43.010
He said, "How would you feel
if you went to the movies

21:43.093 --> 21:45.595
and they cut the center reel out
of the picture?"

21:46.054 --> 21:50.392
DICK: <i>He said, "Dick," he said,
"we've got to establish a terrific show,</i>

21:50.475 --> 21:53.562
<i>a consistent show,
regardless of how long the line is."</i>

21:53.645 --> 21:57.983
And then, from there, the managers put in
little alarm clocks into all the boats,

21:58.066 --> 22:01.111
<i>so the skippers had to have their spiel
timed to a certain point.</i>

22:01.194 --> 22:03.280
<i>And so, everybody learned
and got accustomed to it.</i>

22:03.363 --> 22:05.157
<i>Next time Walt went on the Jungle Cruise,</i>

22:05.240 --> 22:08.535
<i>he had a normal length cruise
and he got off and didn't say a word.</i>

22:08.827 --> 22:11.788
<i>Which is a compliment
in the world of Walt Disney.</i>

22:11.872 --> 22:13.665
You know, that's how you get his approval.

22:14.291 --> 22:18.712
NARRATOR: <i>Nowadays, the skippers
just use landmarks to time their ride.</i>

22:18.795 --> 22:22.382
<i>And the steering is entirely controlled
by an underwater track,</i>

22:22.632 --> 22:26.428
<i>which explains
the one-handed precision moves, of course.</i>

22:26.678 --> 22:29.514
(chuckles)
A little close.

22:30.474 --> 22:32.517
NARRATOR: <i>So, let's stop it here,</i>

22:32.601 --> 22:36.021
<i>because anyone who's been
on the Jungle Cruise in the last 30 years</i>

22:36.104 --> 22:39.816
<i>would probably remember things
a bit differently.</i>

22:39.900 --> 22:43.445
The Jungle Cruise we know today is not
the Jungle Cruise that we opened with.

22:43.528 --> 22:47.449
JEANETTE: <i>Walt actually wanted
Jungle Cruise to be more serious.</i>

22:47.532 --> 22:48.533
NARRATOR: <i>Well, of course.</i>

22:48.617 --> 22:51.161
<i>Walt's</i> True-Life Adventures
<i>weren't funny at all.</i>

22:51.244 --> 22:52.162
(grunting)

22:52.245 --> 22:54.539
NARRATOR: <i>But they did pop in
a few thrills here and there.</i>

22:54.623 --> 22:56.291
MAN 4: Watch out for that big python.

22:57.209 --> 22:59.419
On the right-hand side,
watch, we're approaching them now,

22:59.503 --> 23:01.129
those giant alligators.

23:01.213 --> 23:04.299
Now, watch your hands, please.
Watch the hand... Oh.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.343
NARRATOR:
<i>Considering the abundance of wetness,</i>

23:06.426 --> 23:09.596
<i>the Jungle Cruise was dry
and informational...</i>

23:09.679 --> 23:11.890
WALT: <i>This is one animal
that has no vocal cords.</i>

23:11.973 --> 23:13.141
NARRATOR: <i>...educational...</i>

23:13.225 --> 23:17.104
WALT: <i>And now we're on the Mekong River
of Cochinchina.</i>

23:17.187 --> 23:19.731
NARRATOR: <i>...and absolutely humorless.</i>

23:19.815 --> 23:24.569
In this tropical rainforest,
every tree has a corsage.

23:24.653 --> 23:27.406
It's a misconception
that there was no humor

23:27.489 --> 23:28.990
in the early days of the Jungle Cruise.

23:30.534 --> 23:34.204
We have a copy of the very first script,
and there's a joke in there.

23:34.287 --> 23:36.498
WALT: <i>If you keep watching that far bank,</i>

23:36.581 --> 23:40.001
<i>you can say that you had
a nodding acquaintance with a giraffe.</i>

23:40.127 --> 23:42.003
(crickets chirping)

23:42.087 --> 23:43.463
(clears throat)

23:43.880 --> 23:47.008
It's not a very good joke,
but there's a joke.

23:47.092 --> 23:52.180
NARRATOR: <i>And someone who had to say
such not-very-good jokes was Ron Dominguez</i>

23:52.264 --> 23:55.016
<i>who ended up not only having
his grandparents' tree planted,</i>

23:55.100 --> 23:57.436
<i>but this local kid got a job too.</i>

23:57.519 --> 24:03.275
You had a basic script and then, you know,
sometimes, would throw your own stuff in.

24:03.358 --> 24:06.153
WALT:
<i>No one is invited to this family's dinner.</i>

24:06.236 --> 24:09.030
Now, you look back,
it was probably pretty darn corny.

24:09.114 --> 24:10.198
(chuckles)

24:10.282 --> 24:13.201
NARRATOR: <i>After five years or so
of Disneyland's operation,</i>

24:13.285 --> 24:17.706
<i>rumor has it Walt overheard
a mother deciding to skip the Cruise</i>

24:17.789 --> 24:20.125
<i>because she had done it before.</i>

24:20.208 --> 24:23.044
<i>That moment inspired
Walt's new philosophy.</i>

24:23.128 --> 24:25.797
As long as there is imagination
left in the world,

24:25.881 --> 24:27.716
Disneyland will never be complete.

24:27.799 --> 24:30.343
NARRATOR:
<i>So, to confirm his sneaking suspicions,</i>

24:30.427 --> 24:35.682
<i>Walt turned to his chief gag man,
the one who in large part was responsible</i>

24:35.765 --> 24:40.061
<i>for why so many of Walt's movies
were hilarious and adorable.</i>

24:40.145 --> 24:42.981
<i>And even though
he was an animation legend,</i>

24:43.064 --> 24:46.234
<i>Marc Davis spotted one big problem
with the Jungle Cruise.</i>

24:46.318 --> 24:47.903
"Well, it's not funny."
And he's like, "What?"

24:47.986 --> 24:49.237
He's all, "There's no humor."

24:49.321 --> 24:52.574
NARRATOR:
<i>Well, a nodding acquaintance with humor.</i>

24:52.657 --> 24:54.826
<i>But in any case, it was a problem.</i>

24:54.910 --> 24:58.747
<i>According to Marc, he felt that Disneyland
needed to be a place...</i>

24:58.830 --> 25:03.376
Where people would come in and look
at something and actually laugh out loud.

25:03.460 --> 25:07.005
There wasn't really anything
of that nature there.

25:07.088 --> 25:09.841
NARRATOR: <i>So, with Walt's
humorless hunch confirmed,</i>

25:09.925 --> 25:12.302
<i>Marc Davis made a career pivot</i>

25:12.385 --> 25:16.431
<i>from legendary animator
to Jungle Cruise fixer-upper.</i>

25:16.515 --> 25:19.768
In the early '60s, Marc Davis came in
and brought in the gags

25:19.851 --> 25:23.605
<i>that are really synonymous
with what the attraction has now become.</i>

25:23.688 --> 25:25.774
DAVE: <i>He brought the humor
to everything that he did.</i>

25:25.857 --> 25:27.150
<i>He brought the character,</i>

25:27.234 --> 25:30.403
and, frankly, he brought the basis
of the storytelling

25:30.487 --> 25:34.491
that we are still using to this day
with the hyenas and the apes.

25:34.574 --> 25:38.203
Marc Davis came up
with some artwork concepts

25:38.286 --> 25:41.957
to add not only some humor
to the attraction,

25:42.040 --> 25:43.917
<i>but to add some realism to the animals</i>

25:44.000 --> 25:46.086
<i>that were featured
throughout the Jungle Cruise.</i>

25:46.169 --> 25:49.130
Trying to create some things
that people understood,

25:49.214 --> 25:53.885
trying to do something
that people related to,

25:53.969 --> 25:56.263
and something
that they could possibly react to.

26:00.850 --> 26:02.227
NARRATOR: <i>Metaphorically, at least,</i>

26:02.310 --> 26:06.189
<i>Marc Davis completely drained
the river of that dryness</i>

26:06.273 --> 26:10.902
<i>and refilled the river to the brink
with dozens of new scenes and animals.</i>

26:10.986 --> 26:14.573
<i>And, thanks to advances
in Audio-Animatronics technology,</i>

26:14.656 --> 26:18.326
<i>Marc was able to unleash
a torrent of new ideas.</i>

26:20.745 --> 26:25.500
The elephant trunk, before, they had
just gone up and down or sideways.

26:26.126 --> 26:29.504
And Marc wanted them
to be able to go in a circle.

26:30.088 --> 26:33.592
So, that way, we had to do
a whole new prototype

26:33.675 --> 26:37.679
and come up with a whole new plans
of how to do that.

26:37.762 --> 26:40.098
NARRATOR:
<i>The solution was using a special tube,</i>

26:40.181 --> 26:43.810
<i>which was flexible, durable,
and, above all, water-resistant.</i>

26:44.019 --> 26:45.812
<i>Sometimes referred to as a hose.</i>

26:45.895 --> 26:48.565
And these are the challenges that we were,
you know,

26:48.648 --> 26:51.026
just daily challenges
that we were faced with.

26:51.109 --> 26:52.736
NARRATOR: <i>In a creative stampede,</i>

26:52.819 --> 26:55.780
<i>the elephants were trucked in
from Imagineering HQ.</i>

26:55.864 --> 26:58.491
<i>And, luckily,
they had plenty of trunk space.</i>

26:58.575 --> 26:59.618
(car horn beeps)

26:59.701 --> 27:01.745
NARRATOR: <i>Marc had designed
so many elephants,</i>

27:01.828 --> 27:04.456
<i>he began to worry what Walt might think.</i>

27:04.539 --> 27:07.292
"Well, there's one thing
you're probably not gonna like, Walt."

27:07.375 --> 27:11.338
I said, "That is that nobody
can go through here

27:11.421 --> 27:13.006
and see all these elephants at one time."

27:13.089 --> 27:16.968
NARRATOR: <i>And, like an elephant,
Walt had an idea he'd never forget.</i>

27:17.052 --> 27:19.763
MARC: <i>He said, "God, that's great.
So, the next time they come through,</i>

27:19.846 --> 27:21.806
<i>they'll see something
they didn't the second time."</i>

27:21.890 --> 27:24.309
NARRATOR:
<i>So, the first time, they might see...</i>

27:24.392 --> 27:26.227
-WALT: <i>Little squirt.</i>
-NARRATOR: <i>And the second time...</i>

27:26.311 --> 27:27.479
WALT: <i>And big squirt.</i>

27:27.812 --> 27:29.939
(water splashes)

27:31.524 --> 27:34.569
DAVE: <i>Walt used to tell Marc Davis,
"It's a cocktail party."</i>

27:34.653 --> 27:36.279
Right? These guys are gonna be talking,

27:36.363 --> 27:39.908
and whether you get the dialogue or not,
it's not important.

27:39.991 --> 27:42.702
But you know what?
Guests are wanna go on it again and again

27:42.786 --> 27:44.829
to discover more and more
as they go on it.

27:44.913 --> 27:48.249
NARRATOR: <i>Marc's talent for adding comedy
to serious attractions</i>

27:48.333 --> 27:49.876
<i>was ahead of its time.</i>

27:49.959 --> 27:52.921
<i>However, some of those gags
were based on stereotypes</i>

27:53.004 --> 27:55.507
<i>that are now recognized as inappropriate.</i>

27:56.007 --> 28:01.096
Walt Disney asked me to do
some ideas for the train to see...

28:01.179 --> 28:03.306
<i>that would kind of advertise, uh...</i>

28:04.057 --> 28:05.308
<i>the jungle river ride.</i>

28:05.392 --> 28:08.186
NARRATOR: <i>Well, being the poster boy
of good ideas...</i>

28:08.269 --> 28:09.270
He said, "Oh, god, no.

28:09.354 --> 28:11.981
Hell, that's too good.
We've gotta put it inside the ride."

28:12.607 --> 28:17.028
MARC: <i>It's kind of gratifying
to go through there with a crowd</i>

28:17.112 --> 28:19.781
<i>and people still laugh
after all this length of time.</i>

28:20.407 --> 28:23.076
WALT: <i>The laughing hyenas, at last,
have something to laugh at.</i>

28:23.159 --> 28:25.245
(hyenas laughing)

28:25.328 --> 28:28.415
NARRATOR: <i>Well, thanks to Marc Davis,
now, everybody did.</i>

28:29.582 --> 28:33.420
My history with Jungle Cruise
goes way back when I was just,

28:33.503 --> 28:36.047
<i>you know, a little punk kid
who had a big Afro.</i>

28:36.131 --> 28:37.882
<i>And we lived in Florida,</i>

28:37.966 --> 28:40.552
<i>and so we had this opportunity
to go to Disney.</i>

28:40.635 --> 28:43.596
And I remember riding the Jungle Cruise,

28:43.680 --> 28:47.475
and it's exciting
and it's tantalizing in a way,

28:47.559 --> 28:49.561
and you don't know
what's around the corner.

28:49.644 --> 28:52.021
And you're transported
into this other world.

28:52.105 --> 28:54.691
NARRATOR:
<i>A world where primates are armed,</i>

28:54.774 --> 28:58.403
<i>because the only thing funnier
than a gorilla with a gun</i>

28:58.486 --> 28:59.863
<i>is a skipper with a...</i>

28:59.946 --> 29:00.864
Pun.

29:00.947 --> 29:04.200
NARRATOR: <i>And being one of the fathers
of modern Imagineering,</i>

29:04.284 --> 29:08.329
<i>it only makes sense that Marc Davis
would make a lot of...</i>

29:08.413 --> 29:12.375
Dad jokes that everybody knows
and loathes.

29:12.459 --> 29:15.003
Careful, folks. Ginger snaps.

29:15.086 --> 29:16.337
I love a good pun.

29:16.421 --> 29:18.798
She's one tough cookie, let me tell you.

29:18.882 --> 29:21.050
I love getting on Jungle Cruise.

29:21.134 --> 29:22.510
I know it's a crummy joke,

29:22.594 --> 29:24.596
but I'm gonna milk it
for all it's worth, okay?

29:24.679 --> 29:27.098
It's what brings in the dough,
even though it is stale.

29:27.182 --> 29:29.851
The skippers, they make me laugh.

29:29.934 --> 29:31.936
They are great storytellers.

29:32.020 --> 29:34.981
CARMEN: <i>It's the magic
of the Jungle Cruise experience.</i>

29:35.064 --> 29:38.109
All right, we can go ahead
and put some people in the boat now.

29:38.193 --> 29:41.446
And in that boat is going to be a witty
and charming skipper.

29:41.529 --> 29:43.698
JASON: <i>And they're gonna take you
on an amazing journey.</i>

29:43.782 --> 29:45.408
<i>It's gonna take three weeks of your time.</i>

29:46.201 --> 29:48.369
It's gonna be so entertaining,
it's gonna feel like ten minutes though.

29:48.995 --> 29:53.416
NARRATOR: <i>Well, as the years went by,
it felt like decades, because it was.</i>

29:53.500 --> 29:55.919
<i>And just like the very nature
of the animals</i>

29:56.002 --> 29:58.213
<i>that inhabited the original attraction,</i>

29:58.296 --> 30:01.966
<i>the Jungle Cruise had evolved
into a different kind of experience.</i>

30:02.050 --> 30:04.969
Jungle Cruise became, now,
a very popular attraction

30:05.053 --> 30:05.887
because of the jokes.

30:05.970 --> 30:08.389
But you want it now
for the Jungle Cruise skippers

30:08.473 --> 30:11.935
and the great delivery that they have
more than you do to see

30:12.018 --> 30:13.394
the wildlife that surrounds you.

30:13.478 --> 30:14.354
NARRATOR: <i>But don't worry.</i>

30:14.437 --> 30:17.774
<i>A lot of the same information
from the original is still there.</i>

30:17.857 --> 30:19.359
That's Schweitzer Falls.

30:19.442 --> 30:21.903
Schweitzer Falls was named
after a very famous man,

30:21.986 --> 30:25.907
a very famous explorer and scientist,
Dr. Albert Falls.

30:25.990 --> 30:27.909
-(people laugh)
-A very important man around here.

30:27.992 --> 30:31.120
NARRATOR: <i>But, just to be clear,
there's no ad-libbing on deck.</i>

30:31.204 --> 30:32.956
FLOR: Oh, no! It looks like
a bunch of gorillas

30:33.039 --> 30:34.874
have taken over the safari camp.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.877
Don't make any noises
that sound like a banana.

30:38.795 --> 30:40.004
They find it appealing.

30:40.755 --> 30:42.131
FLOR: All right, let's split.

30:43.132 --> 30:47.220
NARRATOR: <i>When it comes to the script,
all the skippers are in the same boat.</i>

30:47.303 --> 30:50.598
You'll get a copy of the spiel scripts,
and that's kind of like a menu.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.350
NARRATOR: <i>Ooh. Delicious puns.</i>

30:52.433 --> 30:54.310
But instead of appetizers, main course,

30:54.394 --> 30:57.522
it's like, rainforest, elephant pool,
hippo pool, trap safari.

30:57.605 --> 30:58.648
NARRATOR: <i>Sleeping zebras.</i>

30:58.731 --> 31:01.860
FLOR: He looks dead... tired. Dead tired.

31:01.943 --> 31:04.153
Lions are enjoying
their favorite meal today,

31:04.571 --> 31:06.114
zebra on the rocks.

31:06.447 --> 31:08.950
And you get to kind of pick and choose
which ones you like,

31:09.033 --> 31:11.744
so every skipper
gets to have the same jokes,

31:11.828 --> 31:13.496
<i>but also,
it's a little bit of a different vibe</i>

31:13.580 --> 31:14.581
<i>with how they deliver the jokes</i>

31:14.664 --> 31:16.291
and which ones exactly it is
that they pick.

31:17.417 --> 31:20.128
You know, I think that rhinoceros there
is trying to his point across.

31:20.211 --> 31:22.547
FLOR: <i>They always manage
to get their point across.</i>

31:22.630 --> 31:26.634
My style? I would say
I have a pretty, like, high-energy,

31:26.718 --> 31:28.720
sarcastic Jungle Cruise spiel.

31:28.803 --> 31:30.597
Tigers are known to jump over 20 feet.

31:30.680 --> 31:33.725
But not to worry, we're only 15 feet away
so they'll jump right over us.

31:33.808 --> 31:36.519
NARRATOR: <i>Something else
that might go over your head</i>

31:36.603 --> 31:40.273
<i>is this clever little timing check
for the other skippers on the river.</i>

31:40.356 --> 31:41.357
(gunfires)

31:41.441 --> 31:46.738
NARRATOR: <i>Because here, at the hippo pool,
is their cue to fire their pistol upwards.</i>

31:46.821 --> 31:47.989
-(gunfire)
-NARRATOR: <i>Because, you know,</i>

31:48.072 --> 31:51.242
<i>conservation of mechanical hippos
is a real thing after all.</i>

31:51.326 --> 31:55.914
What other job is there here that you get
to stand in a boat with 45 other guests

31:55.997 --> 31:57.415
and just say jokes?

31:57.498 --> 31:59.792
FLOR: The second most feared animal
of the jungle,

31:59.876 --> 32:02.337
-it's the African bull elephant.
-(elephant trumpets)

32:02.420 --> 32:03.463
And if you were wondering

32:03.546 --> 32:05.965
what the number one most feared animal
of the jungle is, folks,

32:06.049 --> 32:09.344
take a look right over here,
it's his mother-in-law.

32:09.427 --> 32:13.097
NARRATOR: <i>But there's one joke
that towers above all the others.</i>

32:13.181 --> 32:17.060
<i>So perfectly crafted, it's become legend.</i>

32:17.143 --> 32:18.811
You've read about it in the papers,
you've seen it in the movies,

32:18.895 --> 32:21.397
put your hands together for the one,
the only, amazing...

32:21.481 --> 32:24.150
The back side of water!

32:24.233 --> 32:25.068
NARRATOR: <i>So, that's...</i>

32:25.151 --> 32:27.403
The back side of water. See that?

32:27.487 --> 32:29.113
Yeah, don't try that at home.

32:29.197 --> 32:30.156
You'll hit your head on the faucet.

32:30.239 --> 32:32.450
The back side of water, Schweitzer Falls.

32:32.533 --> 32:35.411
DWAYNE: <i>When I first heard it,
I remember thinking,</i>

32:35.495 --> 32:37.705
"I think I should get this,
but I don't understand it."

32:38.498 --> 32:39.832
It doesn't make any sense.

32:39.916 --> 32:42.377
The back side of water
makes no sense whatsoever.

32:42.877 --> 32:45.922
However, it makes all the sense
in the world.

32:46.005 --> 32:50.176
NARRATOR: <i>It's a joke that,
if you tell it right, never falls flat.</i>

32:50.259 --> 32:51.678
<i>Just make sure you tell it!</i>

32:51.761 --> 32:54.722
If you don't do the "back side of water"
joke, guests will tell you

32:54.806 --> 32:58.017
that you forgot to do
the "back side of water" joke.

32:58.101 --> 32:59.352
Like, "How dare you?"

32:59.435 --> 33:01.437
NARRATOR:
<i>As well as aggravating superfans,</i>

33:01.521 --> 33:04.399
<i>the falls actually serve
a practical purpose.</i>

33:04.482 --> 33:09.362
<i>That being the mixing station for the dye
that turns the water jungle green.</i>

33:09.445 --> 33:11.823
<i>You know, every jungle has them.</i>

33:11.906 --> 33:14.117
<i>But anyway,
from whichever side you see it,</i>

33:14.200 --> 33:15.785
<i>the waterfall marks the moment</i>

33:15.868 --> 33:18.871
<i>where the Jungle Cruise
heads toward the dock.</i>

33:18.955 --> 33:22.333
<i>But not without a final wink
to the original cruise.</i>

33:22.417 --> 33:24.335
FLOR:
Oh, look, it's my good friend, Trader Sam!

33:24.419 --> 33:26.045
Hey, Trader Sam! What's up?
How's it going?

33:26.129 --> 33:28.756
The great story behind Trader Sam
is, of course,

33:28.840 --> 33:31.175
<i>that started in the Jungle Cruise in 1955.</i>

33:31.259 --> 33:33.553
Trader Sam is kind of
like a friend of the skippers.

33:33.636 --> 33:35.888
He kind of hangs out on the river's edge

33:35.972 --> 33:38.433
and he also collects things
that he takes back

33:38.516 --> 33:41.102
to his Enchanted Tiki Bar
and his Grog Grotto.

33:41.185 --> 33:43.521
NARRATOR:
<i>Which is but a stone's throw away.</i>

33:43.604 --> 33:45.314
<i>Now, speaking of rocks...</i>

33:45.398 --> 33:47.025
<i>Oh, sorry, not those ones.</i>

33:47.108 --> 33:49.277
<i>The actual The Rock.</i>

33:49.360 --> 33:53.406
I have had a chance
to skipper many Jungle Cruise boats

33:54.407 --> 33:56.534
over the years, in multiple parks.

33:56.617 --> 33:58.494
NARRATOR: <i>Whoa. Hopefully not like this.</i>

33:58.578 --> 33:59.787
And you're probably thinking,

33:59.871 --> 34:02.415
"Wow, I don't remember
ever seeing you there, Rock."

34:02.498 --> 34:04.167
NARRATOR: <i>Ha! He's absolutely right.</i>

34:04.250 --> 34:06.669
Of course, you didn't,
because it all happened in my mind.

34:06.753 --> 34:08.296
NARRATOR: <i>And it was the imagination</i>

34:08.379 --> 34:12.008
<i>inside that muscular,
Mickey Mouse-loving mind</i>

34:12.091 --> 34:14.677
<i>that would eventually propel him to star</i>

34:14.761 --> 34:17.805
<i>in Disney's movie version
of the Jungle Cruise.</i>

34:17.889 --> 34:19.599
-Welcome to the adventure of a lifetime.
-Oh.

34:19.682 --> 34:22.351
CANDICE: <i>It's really interesting
to see that they're in costumes</i>

34:22.435 --> 34:25.271
that are actually inspired
by <i>The African Queen.</i>

34:25.354 --> 34:27.315
Mind takin' the tiller, miss?

34:27.398 --> 34:28.649
-Huh?
-Come on.

34:28.733 --> 34:32.111
NARRATOR: <i>And it's not just a nodding nod
to</i> The African Queen.

34:32.195 --> 34:33.154
<i>Just look at those hats.</i>

34:33.905 --> 34:37.992
So, it's nice to see that tie in
to our heritage here at this attraction

34:38.076 --> 34:39.535
with the film that inspired us.

34:39.619 --> 34:40.745
NARRATOR: <i>But mostly, of course,</i>

34:40.828 --> 34:43.664
<i>it was the Jungle Cruise itself
that inspired it,</i>

34:43.748 --> 34:45.500
<i>filled with action and comedy...</i>

34:45.583 --> 34:47.460
-I got it. I don't got it.
-Try... No...

34:47.543 --> 34:50.088
NARRATOR: <i>The movie really does
have a lot in common</i>

34:50.171 --> 34:53.216
<i>with the attraction,
and a lot not in common.</i>

34:53.299 --> 34:55.968
-The back side of water!
-NARRATOR: <i>Exactly!</i>

34:56.052 --> 34:58.888
<i>You won't be hearing
Dwayne Johnson saying...</i>

34:58.971 --> 35:00.890
The back side of water.

35:01.307 --> 35:03.309
NARRATOR:
<i>Actually, yeah, it works when he does it.</i>

35:03.392 --> 35:04.602
The eighth wonder of the world.

35:04.685 --> 35:05.603
(laughs)

35:05.686 --> 35:08.898
NARRATOR: <i>A world that's now rich
with Jungle Cruises,</i>

35:08.981 --> 35:11.567
<i>beginning when the river burst
its American banks</i>

35:11.651 --> 35:14.737
<i>into Tokyo Disneyland in 1983,</i>

35:14.821 --> 35:18.825
<i>where it was the first cruise
to run in a clockwise direction.</i>

35:18.908 --> 35:20.451
<i>Then there's Hong Kong,</i>

35:20.535 --> 35:23.621
<i>a humid and semitropical destination
in its own right.</i>

35:24.413 --> 35:27.166
<i>And this version is quite different.</i>

35:27.250 --> 35:30.086
<i>Guests get caught up in the middle
of an epic battle</i>

35:30.169 --> 35:32.505
<i>between the gods of fire and water,</i>

35:32.588 --> 35:36.926
<i>and being on the back side of that
is more of a relief than a laugh.</i>

35:37.301 --> 35:40.304
<i>And even though
this worldwide network of rivers</i>

35:40.388 --> 35:42.431
<i>might not be physically connected,</i>

35:42.515 --> 35:46.060
<i>there is a shared history
and kinship among the skippers.</i>

35:46.144 --> 35:48.354
They sent me to Tokyo when I was a skipper

35:48.437 --> 35:51.107
to meet with other Jungle Cruise skippers
from around the world.

35:51.190 --> 35:52.525
KEVIN: <i>They brought some
from Disney World...</i>

35:53.359 --> 35:55.862
<i>They brought some
from Hong Kong Disneyland</i>

35:55.945 --> 35:59.782
and we all connected immediately,
there was an immediate kinship.

35:59.866 --> 36:01.784
NARRATOR: <i>But the bond
these skippers share</i>

36:01.868 --> 36:03.744
<i>isn't just about the gags,</i>

36:03.828 --> 36:07.123
<i>although many say Kevin was the best
on the river in his day.</i>

36:07.206 --> 36:12.670
No! Bad elephant! Bad squirt.
Let's get out of here before he reloads.

36:12.753 --> 36:16.799
He's reloaded.
Everyone, get down! Duck! Duck! Goose.

36:17.550 --> 36:19.177
I have a lot of friends who've gone...

36:19.260 --> 36:20.970
who've left the Jungle Cruise
only to go back

36:21.053 --> 36:22.889
<i>because it's like therapy for them.</i>

36:22.972 --> 36:26.142
KEVIN: <i>It's a way for them
to forget everything else, go out there,</i>

36:26.225 --> 36:28.477
<i>and just tell jokes and have a good time.</i>

36:28.561 --> 36:31.397
I mean, I would, in a heartbeat,
jump into a boat and do a spiel,

36:31.480 --> 36:32.857
and then put on some shorts.

36:32.940 --> 36:34.942
NARRATOR: <i>Hopefully not in that order.</i>

36:35.943 --> 36:40.072
<i>In many ways, the Jungle Cruise
is more than just an attraction.</i>

36:40.156 --> 36:44.785
<i>It represents the long-running history
of the Disney Parks themselves.</i>

36:44.869 --> 36:46.829
We'll always have
a Sleeping Beauty Castle,

36:46.913 --> 36:49.707
<i>and we'll always have Jungle Cruise.</i>

36:49.790 --> 36:53.377
They're mainstays
that will always stay intact.

36:53.461 --> 36:55.630
NARRATOR:
<i>As an original opening day attraction,</i>

36:55.713 --> 37:01.260
<i>it was carved from the desert
and created literally out of thin, dry air</i>

37:01.344 --> 37:06.390
<i>by Harper Goff and his stick,
Bill Evans with his salvaged trees,</i>

37:06.474 --> 37:08.517
<i>and with the help of Marc Davis,</i>

37:08.601 --> 37:13.940
<i>it grew into the thick, luscious,
beloved attraction that it is today.</i>

37:14.023 --> 37:16.150
MARC: <i>I had a talk with Walt.</i>

37:16.234 --> 37:19.111
<i>I said, "You know,
there's two ways I could do this.</i>

37:19.195 --> 37:21.113
<i>An expensive way and an inexpensive way."</i>

37:21.197 --> 37:23.115
And he says,
"I think when you do something,

37:23.199 --> 37:25.701
and you do it well enough,

37:25.785 --> 37:27.620
the public's gonna pay you back for it."

37:27.703 --> 37:32.124
NARRATOR: <i>With close to a billion guests
visiting just Disneyland alone,</i>

37:32.208 --> 37:33.584
<i>it's fair to say...</i>

37:33.668 --> 37:37.255
The public appreciate and accept
what I've done all these years.

37:37.338 --> 37:38.881
That is a great reward.

37:39.382 --> 37:40.549
INTERVIEWER: <i>I'm sure it is.</i>

37:40.633 --> 37:44.553
<i>It seems unlikely,
but if you had it to do over again,</i>

37:44.637 --> 37:46.931
<i>would you do any part of it differently?</i>

37:47.014 --> 37:49.016
(laughs)

37:49.100 --> 37:51.352
I don't know.
I hope I don't have to do it over again.

37:53.771 --> 37:57.525
JEANETTE: <i>You think about what Walt's
original vision was for Jungle Cruise,</i>

37:57.608 --> 38:00.695
Walt wanted guests
to have a real adventure

38:00.778 --> 38:03.030
like the adventures they saw
on their television

38:03.114 --> 38:04.156
<i>when they were watching</i>
True-Life Adventures.

38:04.240 --> 38:06.367
NARRATOR: <i>And this was truly realized</i>

38:06.450 --> 38:11.289
<i>when Disney's Animal Kingdom theme park
opened in Florida in 1998.</i>

38:11.372 --> 38:13.291
JEANETTE:
<i>I think Walt would have been very proud</i>

38:13.374 --> 38:16.002
because he would have said,
"Yes, right! This is exactly it.

38:16.085 --> 38:20.131
Real animals where guests
can get on the vehicle

38:20.214 --> 38:22.174
<i>and believe they are in Africa."</i>

38:22.258 --> 38:24.302
WALT: <i>Most everyone has been impressed by</i>

38:24.385 --> 38:27.471
and curious about the realism
of Adventureland.

38:27.555 --> 38:31.517
The lifelike animals,
the authentic tropical settings.

38:31.934 --> 38:33.936
JEANETTE: <i>That is what Disney, I think,
would have been proud of.</i>

38:34.020 --> 38:35.354
<i>And so Jungle Cruise started it,</i>

38:35.438 --> 38:37.064
and we're actually delivering it
in full force

38:37.148 --> 38:39.275
with a full, built-out vision
at Animal Kingdom today.

38:39.650 --> 38:43.487
NARRATOR: <i>But the Jungle Cruise
is much more than just a stepping stone</i>

38:43.571 --> 38:47.158
<i>in the legacy of Disney's
immersive experiences.</i>

38:47.241 --> 38:51.787
<i>This truly classic attraction
isn't just about the skippers,</i>

38:51.871 --> 38:54.290
<i>or the jokes, or even the animals,</i>

38:54.373 --> 38:59.628
<i>but the incredible creative determination
of the original skipper</i>

38:59.712 --> 39:03.966
<i>who, above all the odds,
set sail on an adventure</i>

39:04.050 --> 39:06.552
<i>that's not even close
to pulling in to the dock.</i>

39:06.635 --> 39:08.512
WALT: <i>We're back to civilization,</i>

39:08.596 --> 39:11.390
<i>and it's been a real pleasure
to take this trip with you.</i>

39:11.474 --> 39:15.603
<i>Thank you, everyone.
Hope to ride with you again sometime.</i>

39:15.686 --> 39:18.689
NARRATOR: <i>But, for now,
it's time for us to disembark.</i>

39:18.773 --> 39:21.859
Have a great day, folks.
Take care, and always remember...

39:24.570 --> 39:25.529
Oh, wait, I forgot.

39:25.613 --> 39:27.615
(crickets chirping)

39:34.038 --> 39:36.040
(light music)
