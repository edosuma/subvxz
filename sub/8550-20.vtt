BUT NO BALLADS.

12:32.953 --> 12:34.387
THREE. ALL BALLADS.

12:34.454 --> 12:36.824
SEVEN, AND MAKE
MOON EYES DURING
THE MUSHY PARTS.

12:36.890 --> 12:39.459
FOUR. MOON EYES
DURING TWO.

12:39.526 --> 12:42.029
SIX. HALF BALLADS,
MOON EYES DURING
THE MUSHY PARTS,

12:42.095 --> 12:45.032
AND DURING
THE CHORUS,
SHAKE THE BOOTIE.

13:04.184 --> 13:05.752
HI.

13:05.819 --> 13:07.620
HELLO.

13:07.687 --> 13:09.389
IT'S SNOWING OUT HERE.

13:11.258 --> 13:12.525
WE NOTICED.

13:12.592 --> 13:14.261
WE HAVE A VIEW.

13:14.327 --> 13:15.762
WANT TO HAVE
A SNOWBALL FIGHT?

13:15.829 --> 13:17.030
NO, THANKS.

13:17.097 --> 13:17.931
I DO.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.332
HA HA HA!

13:21.835 --> 13:23.203
NO, NO.
CARL, CARL.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.538
DON'T GO OUT THERE.
YOU'LL CATCH COLD.

13:25.605 --> 13:27.007
HARRIETTE,
THERE'S NO WALL.

13:27.074 --> 13:30.410
IT'S THE SAME
TEMPERATURE IN HERE.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.812
ARE YOU IN A BAD MOOD?

13:32.880 --> 13:35.983
NOW, WHY WOULD I BE IN
A BAD MOOD, HARRIETTE?

13:36.049 --> 13:39.452
I DROVE 3 1/2 HOURS
THROUGH HEAVY TRAFFIC

13:39.519 --> 13:41.288
JUST SO WE COULD
HAVE OUR HONEYMOON

13:41.354 --> 13:44.391
IN A COZY, ROMANTIC
CONSTRUCTION BOO-BOO!

13:49.362 --> 13:52.799
CARL, YOU ACT LIKE
THIS IS MY FAULT.

13:52.866 --> 13:55.035
THERE'S ONLY TWO OF US
IN THE ROOM, HARRIETTE.

13:55.102 --> 13:57.070
AND I KNOW IT'S NOT
MY FAULT.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.906
WAIT A MINUTE, CARL.

13:58.972 --> 14:01.341
I ASKED FOR YOUR INPUT
AS TO WHERE TO GO.

14:01.408 --> 14:04.044
AND YOU SAID THAT
WHATEVER I DECIDED WAS FINE.

14:04.111 --> 14:05.678
WELL, THAT WAS
WHEN I THOUGHT,

14:05.745 --> 14:07.680
YOU KNEW WHAT
YOU WERE DOING.

14:07.747 --> 14:08.949
WHAT?

14:09.016 --> 14:11.018
YES. YOU SHOULD'VE FOUND OUT
ABOUT THE PLACE

14:11.084 --> 14:13.253
WHEN YOU CALLED
FOR RESERVATIONS.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.388
ALRIGHT.

14:15.455 --> 14:16.523
HELLO.

14:16.589 --> 14:19.359
WE'D LIKE TO
BOOK A CABIN
WITH A FIREPLACE,

14:19.426 --> 14:22.862
A KING-SIZE BED,
AND FOUR WALLS.

14:22.930 --> 14:25.332
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

14:25.398 --> 14:28.301
CARL, I'M SAYING THAT
WHENEVER THINGS
ARE GOING WELL,

14:28.368 --> 14:31.972
YOU ALWAYS FIND SOME
WAY TO TAKE YOUR SHARE
OF THE CREDIT,

14:32.039 --> 14:33.440
BUT WHEN THINGS
ARE GOING WRONG,

14:33.506 --> 14:37.945
IT'S ALWAYS ME
WHO TAKES ALL THE BLAME.

14:38.011 --> 14:40.647
OH, POOR HARRIETTE!

14:42.515 --> 14:44.584
WHAT A SAD SONG.

14:44.651 --> 14:46.019
I'D PLAY THE VIOLIN
FOR YOU

14:46.086 --> 14:47.854
IF I HAD FEELING
IN MY FINGERS.

14:47.921 --> 14:50.157
OH, THAT DOES IT!

14:50.223 --> 14:52.592
I WASN'T GONNA SAY IT
BUT IT'S GOT TO BE SAID.

14:52.659 --> 14:53.860
OH, IS THAT RIGHT?

14:53.927 --> 14:55.028
THAT'S RIGHT!

14:55.095 --> 14:56.896
CARL WINSLOW...

14:58.932 --> 15:00.934
THERE'S A GOAT
EATING YOUR SHORTS.

15:07.074 --> 15:08.408
YOU KNOW, HARRIETTE,

15:08.475 --> 15:12.212
YOU'VE SAID LOW THINGS
TO ME IN THE PAST,

15:12.279 --> 15:14.914
BUT WHAT THE HECK
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

15:14.982 --> 15:16.016
LOOK.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.951
THERE'S A GOAT
EATING YOUR SHORTS!

15:20.553 --> 15:21.921
HEY!

15:21.989 --> 15:23.323
SHOO!

15:23.390 --> 15:24.324
SHOO!

15:24.391 --> 15:25.525
SHOO, GOAT!

15:30.964 --> 15:32.199
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT?

15:32.265 --> 15:35.835
HE MADE A MEAL
OUT OF YOUR BOXERS.

15:35.902 --> 15:38.938
I WONDER WHAT KIND
OF WINE GOES BEST

15:39.006 --> 15:40.440
WITH UNDERPANTS.

15:44.511 --> 15:45.678
SWEETHEART,

15:45.745 --> 15:47.480
I'M SORRY
I YELLED AT YOU.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.182
OH, THAT'S OKAY.

15:49.249 --> 15:50.917
AND I'LL NEVER FORGET
THIS ANNIVERSARY,

15:50.984 --> 15:52.252
ME, NEITHER.

15:52.319 --> 15:55.188
HEY, YOU REMEMBER
WHEN WE FIRST
GOT MARRIED?

15:55.255 --> 15:57.257
OUR APARTMENT
HAD FOUR WALLS,

15:57.324 --> 15:59.092
BUT THAT'S
ABOUT ALL IT HAD.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.393
COULDN'T
AFFORD FURNITURE.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.895
HALF THE TIME
THE FURNACE WAS BUSTED.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.265
HARDLY HAD
ANY HOT WATER.

16:05.332 --> 16:07.200
BUT WE HAD
EACH OTHER.

16:07.267 --> 16:09.136
AND THAT WAS ENOUGH.

16:09.202 --> 16:11.538
IT STILL IS,
FOR ME.

16:11.604 --> 16:12.639
FOR ME, TOO.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.542
I LOVE YOU,
HARRIETTE WINSLOW.

16:16.509 --> 16:18.145
MORE NOW THAN EVER.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.020
HEY.

16:27.087 --> 16:28.055
WHY DON'T YOU
GO INSIDE

16:28.121 --> 16:30.857
AND PUT ON
THAT SEXY NEGLIGEE?

16:30.923 --> 16:33.460
CARL, IT'S FREEZING.

16:33.526 --> 16:35.662
I'LL KEEP YOU WARM.

16:35.728 --> 16:37.264
WHAT ABOUT THE GOAT?

16:37.330 --> 16:39.266
LET HIM GET
HIS OWN WOMAN.

16:41.168 --> 16:44.837
* TONIGHT WILL BE
A SPECIAL NIGHT *

16:44.904 --> 16:47.940
* NO MATTER WHERE WE GO *

16:48.007 --> 16:51.411
* AND I'M SO PROUD

16:51.478 --> 16:54.281
* I JUST WANT
TO LET YOU KNOW *

16:54.347 --> 16:55.648
* YOU'VE GOT ME SAYING *

16:55.715 --> 16:58.085
* MY, MY, MY *

16:58.151 --> 16:59.786
* MY, MY, MY, MY *

17:00.953 --> 17:02.122
* YOU SURE LOOK *

17:02.189 --> 17:04.391
* GOOD TONIGHT *

17:06.593 --> 17:09.396
* AND IT'S SO DAMN FINE *

17:13.566 --> 17:16.035
* YES, YOU DO,
YES, YOU DO *

17:17.304 --> 17:21.274
* AND I'M SO PROUD
TO BE WITH YOU *

17:21.341 --> 17:27.046
* SO PROUD
TO SHARE YOUR LOVE *

17:27.114 --> 17:29.716
* WHOA, MY BABY *

17:29.782 --> 17:32.051
* WHOA, MY BABY *

17:32.119 --> 17:34.921
* ALL THAT I WANT
YOU TO DO *

17:34.987 --> 17:36.256
* I WANT YA *

17:36.323 --> 17:38.858
* COME ON-UH,
COME ON-UH, COME ON *

17:38.925 --> 17:40.026
* I WANT YOU TO SAY *

17:40.093 --> 17:41.561
* THAT YOU'RE GONNA
BE ALL MINE *

17:41.628 --> 17:42.795
* YOU'RE GONNA
BE ALL MINE *

17:42.862 --> 17:45.265
* BABY, MINE *

17:48.435 --> 17:53.140
* YOU SURE
LOOK GOOD TO *

17:55.175 --> 18:00.580
* NIGHT *

18:17.897 --> 18:19.098
OH, JOHNNY,
YOU WERE GREAT.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.833
YOU WERE WONDERFUL,
INCREDIBLE--

18:20.900 --> 18:24.304
ALRIGHT! ALRIGHT!
I THINK WE GET THE POINT!

18:25.505 --> 18:27.740
WELL...THAT WAS
THE LAST SONG.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.976
I THINK YOU HAVE A...

18:30.042 --> 18:32.044
LITTLE SOMETHING
FOR ME.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.346
YES, INDEEDY.

18:33.413 --> 18:35.282
MY END
OF THE BARGAIN.

18:35.348 --> 18:38.251
YOUR VERY OWN
MICKEY MANTLE
ROOKIE CARD.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.022
YES!

18:43.089 --> 18:44.324
SO, JOHNNY,

18:44.391 --> 18:46.959
CARE TO SING
AT OUR WEDDING
IN A FEW YEARS?

18:47.026 --> 18:49.496
WELL...NO.
I'M A VERY BUSY MAN.

18:49.562 --> 18:53.500
TOO BUSY
FOR A TY COBB
AND HONUS WAGNER?

18:53.566 --> 18:55.502
I'LL BE THERE.

18:55.568 --> 18:56.869
I WON'T.

19:00.006 --> 19:01.341
BYE.

19:02.409 --> 19:05.878
* YOU SURE LOOK
GOOD TO *

19:08.315 --> 19:10.717
* NI-I-I-I... *

19:13.253 --> 19:14.987
HEY, ENOUGH OF THAT!

19:15.054 --> 19:17.290
* I-I-IGHT *

19:30.237 --> 19:31.638
WELL, LAURA,

19:31.704 --> 19:33.973
I ARRANGED FOR YOU
TO MEET JOHNNY GILL.

19:34.040 --> 19:37.544
AND NOT ONLY THAT
I GOT HIM TO SERENADE YOU.

19:37.610 --> 19:40.213
I THINK YOU
OWE ME A KISS.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.219
I KNOW.

19:49.456 --> 19:50.757
A DEAL IS A DEAL.

19:50.823 --> 19:53.293
I COULDN'T HAVE
PUT IT BETTER MYSELF.

19:55.262 --> 19:56.229
AHEM.

19:56.296 --> 19:58.231
ONE MOMENT, PLEASE.

20:22.355 --> 20:24.624
OH, IT'S NO GOOD.

20:28.595 --> 20:31.331
I CAN'T GO THROUGH
WITH IT.

20:35.001 --> 20:36.403
I'M SUPPOSED
TO SAY THAT.

20:38.037 --> 20:41.274
LAURA, I FEEL LIKE
I'M FORCING YOU
TO KISS ME,

20:42.409 --> 20:45.177
LIKE IT'S
A BUSINESS ARRANGEMENT.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.280
WELL, THAT'S
PRECISELY WHAT IT IS.

20:48.214 --> 20:50.016
OH, THAT CHEAPENS IT.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.285
OH, LAURA,
I WANT YOU TO KISS ME,

20:52.352 --> 20:54.687
BUT IT HAS TO BE
VOLUNTARY.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.923
I'LL WAIT FOR THAT
WONDERFUL MOMENT

20:56.989 --> 20:58.958
WHEN YOU WANT
TO KISS ME.

20:59.025 --> 21:00.360
GOODNIGHT, LAURA.

21:04.063 --> 21:05.498
STEVE.

21:05.565 --> 21:07.667
YEAH?

21:07.734 --> 21:11.504
WHAT YOU DID
FOR ME TONIGHT
WAS REALLY SPECIAL.

21:11.571 --> 21:13.473
IT MEANT
A LOT TO ME.

21:13.540 --> 21:17.243
I KNOW THAT
BASEBALL CARD
MEANT A LOT TO YOU.

21:17.310 --> 21:19.111
THE TRUTH IS,

21:19.178 --> 21:21.147
YOU DESERVE A KISS.

21:21.213 --> 21:23.049
YOU MEAN,
YOU WANT TO KISS ME?

21:23.115 --> 21:24.817
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.923
I SAID DESERVE,
NOT WANT.

21:32.459 --> 21:34.361
WELL, I'LL TAKE IT!

21:34.427 --> 21:35.962
OH...OH, BOY.

21:37.063 --> 21:38.398
OOHHH!

21:43.736 --> 21:45.304
OOOHHH!

21:45.372 --> 21:46.639
OOH-HOO!

21:47.340 --> 21:48.641
OOH.

21:48.708 --> 21:49.942
OOOH!

21:50.009 --> 21:51.644
OOH.

21:51.711 --> 21:52.044
OOH.

21:52.111 --> 21:53.713
OOOH.
