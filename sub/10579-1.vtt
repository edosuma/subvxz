WEBVTT

02:20.340 --> 02:21.707
Keith Jesperson,
my favorite driver.

02:21.841 --> 02:22.741
How you doing?

02:22.842 --> 02:24.443
Good.
So what's in the bag?

02:24.577 --> 02:26.078
Just some presents
for Cora and the kids

02:26.212 --> 02:26.945
from the road.

02:27.013 --> 02:28.113
I miss 'em
when I'm gone.

02:28.214 --> 02:30.249
Aw, that's sweet
you spoil them like that.

02:30.383 --> 02:31.884
Yeah, they're only kids
for so long.

02:32.018 --> 02:33.085
Yeah?

02:33.153 --> 02:34.286
Well, my 30-year-old's
still living in the garage

02:34.354 --> 02:36.088
trying to build
a better bong.

02:37.357 --> 02:38.423
Hey, today's the big day.

02:38.458 --> 02:39.925
The Mounties are calling.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.293
Yeah, I am golden.

02:41.361 --> 02:42.628
I studied that test for a year.

02:42.795 --> 02:43.896
I nailed it.

02:43.963 --> 02:45.264
Took the physical,

02:45.398 --> 02:46.665
nailed it.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.767
And you know what?
I look real good on a horse.

02:48.902 --> 02:50.936
Oh, well, I bet you do.

02:51.070 --> 02:51.870
You're not
even Canadian,

02:52.005 --> 02:53.105
Jesperson.

02:53.239 --> 02:55.607
I was born in Canada, Dez.

02:55.708 --> 02:57.776
It is the most beautiful place
in the world.

02:57.844 --> 03:00.345
And it's a better life
for me, Cora and the kids.

03:00.413 --> 03:01.346
Aw...

03:01.481 --> 03:03.282
Dudley Do-Right
to the rescue, huh?

03:03.316 --> 03:06.418
That's an animated character
and a cliche, Dez.

03:06.486 --> 03:10.422
The actual Mounties
are a world-class organization.

03:10.523 --> 03:11.757
Fascinating.

03:11.891 --> 03:12.991
Anyway,

03:13.159 --> 03:14.092
I got stuff coming in
every day this week,

03:14.227 --> 03:15.260
so I hope you're
around a while.

03:15.395 --> 03:17.196
No one ever
complains about you.

03:17.263 --> 03:19.598
Except that we don't
see enough of you.

03:19.766 --> 03:22.301
Personally speaking,
of course.

03:22.468 --> 03:24.303
Why don't you two
get a room?

03:25.305 --> 03:26.939
See you later.

03:28.541 --> 03:29.641
How's Cora
and the kids?

03:29.809 --> 03:31.076
A-1.

03:31.244 --> 03:32.778
You know, she's the best thing
that ever came along for you,

03:32.912 --> 03:33.812
you know that, right?

03:33.880 --> 03:35.881
She is a saint.

03:36.015 --> 03:37.716
How are you two lovebirds doing?

03:37.850 --> 03:39.551
Up and down.

03:39.652 --> 03:40.752
You and me didn't learn
a damn thing

03:40.820 --> 03:42.421
about marriage, huh?

03:42.589 --> 03:43.555
Except what a lousy idea it was.

03:47.327 --> 03:48.260
I'm on my way over

03:48.394 --> 03:49.528
to help pop build a deck.

03:49.596 --> 03:51.363
Why don't you come over?

04:02.308 --> 04:03.141
Sorry.

04:03.276 --> 04:06.144
Oh, no, no, I got it.

04:07.080 --> 04:07.846
Hey...

04:07.981 --> 04:10.349
You okay?

04:11.317 --> 04:13.285
Yukon, here I come.

04:24.063 --> 04:26.164
Hey, he's back!

04:26.266 --> 04:28.667
I'm back from the Crusades!

04:29.902 --> 04:31.169
Anyone home?

04:31.271 --> 04:33.605
Where are you guys?

04:44.417 --> 04:45.450
Hello.

04:45.518 --> 04:46.718
<i> Yes, hello,</i>

04:46.819 --> 04:48.720
<i> this is Colonel Lamaire,
from the Canadian police,</i>

04:48.821 --> 04:50.022
<i> calling from Toronto.</i>

04:50.056 --> 04:52.457
<i> I'm trying to reach
Mr. Keith Jesperson.</i>

04:52.558 --> 04:55.160
This is Keith speaking.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.262
I've been waiting
for your call.

04:57.363 --> 04:58.563
<i> Good afternoon,
mister Jesperson.</i>

04:58.665 --> 05:00.299
Good afternoon, Colonel.

05:00.433 --> 05:01.667
How is it up there?

05:01.768 --> 05:03.235
Perfect, I bet.

05:03.336 --> 05:04.636
<i> Yes, very nice up here.</i>

05:04.704 --> 05:08.106
<i> I'm afraid I have
some disappointing news, sir.</i>

05:08.241 --> 05:09.374
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

05:09.475 --> 05:10.742
<i> Well, sir,</i>

05:10.877 --> 05:12.177
<i> the RC's have looked over
your medical records,</i>

05:12.312 --> 05:14.146
<i> including X-rays
of your shoulder,</i>

05:14.280 --> 05:15.947
<i> and I'm very sorry
to inform you</i>

05:16.015 --> 05:17.316
<i> we aren't going to be able
to move forward</i>

05:17.417 --> 05:18.717
<i> with your application.</i>

05:18.851 --> 05:21.687
Uh, no, Colonel,
there must a mistake.

05:21.788 --> 05:22.888
There's nothing wrong
with my shoulder.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.190
Someone read the X-ray wrong.

05:25.291 --> 05:27.559
<i> Nonetheless, sir,
we cannot dismiss it.</i>

05:27.660 --> 05:28.894
<i> On behalf of the Mounties,</i>

05:28.961 --> 05:30.595
<i> you have my deepest regret,
Mr. Jesperson.</i>

05:30.730 --> 05:32.397
I don't understand.

05:32.465 --> 05:35.467
<i> I'm sorry, Mr. Jesperson.</i>

05:37.537 --> 05:38.704
<i> Are you there, sir?</i>

05:38.838 --> 05:41.540
Yeah, I'm here.

05:41.708 --> 05:43.275
Thank you for the call, sir.

06:17.443 --> 06:18.643
"Dear Keith...

06:18.811 --> 06:20.278
<i> ...by the time you read this,</i>

06:20.446 --> 06:23.949
<i> I will be at my parents
with the kids.</i>

06:24.117 --> 06:25.584
<i> After 14 years together,</i>

06:25.718 --> 06:26.952
<i> I can't continue
in our marriage.</i>

06:27.086 --> 06:29.855
<i> You know how much
we've grown apart.</i>

06:29.989 --> 06:31.623
<i> I never see you.</i>

06:31.791 --> 06:32.858
<i> You're always on the road.</i>

06:33.025 --> 06:34.860
<i> I've given this
a lot of thought,</i>

06:34.994 --> 06:37.162
<i> and I will always care
about you,</i>

06:37.263 --> 06:38.730
<i> but it's over.</i>

06:38.898 --> 06:40.365
<i> You can call the kids
now and then,</i>

06:40.533 --> 06:41.700
<i> but not me.</i>

06:41.834 --> 06:44.503
<i> Cora."</i>

06:57.884 --> 07:00.352
Special agent
Melinda Gand...

07:00.486 --> 07:02.120
The only reason
I stay in the FBI.

07:02.188 --> 07:04.156
What about stopping
criminals, Anselo?

07:04.290 --> 07:05.557
Protecting America.

07:05.658 --> 07:06.792
I find your
patriotism exciting.

07:06.926 --> 07:07.826
I thought you were
getting married.

07:07.960 --> 07:08.894
What happened,
she get to know you?

07:09.028 --> 07:10.061
You know, Gand,

07:10.196 --> 07:11.797
specializing in
crimes against women

07:11.864 --> 07:13.698
is taking the romance
out of your life.

07:13.833 --> 07:14.633
Is that right?

07:14.734 --> 07:16.835
I sense a secret
hunger in you

07:16.969 --> 07:18.470
for something
more thrilling

07:18.571 --> 07:20.038
than blood spatter

07:20.106 --> 07:21.373
and wiretaps.

07:21.507 --> 07:22.774
We should have dinner
and talk about it sometime.

07:22.942 --> 07:25.410
Anselo, I owe you an apology.

07:25.545 --> 07:27.779
See, I was under
the mistaken impression

07:27.914 --> 07:29.748
that you were living
in this century.

07:29.816 --> 07:32.083
Some people would take
what you just said

07:32.251 --> 07:33.351
as sexual harassment.

07:33.519 --> 07:35.253
MaybeIi should ask
special agent in charge Kuttner

07:35.388 --> 07:36.621
what he thinks?

07:36.689 --> 07:38.390
All I'm saying is you should
join the human race sometime

07:38.491 --> 07:39.991
and go on a date
with someone, Gand.

07:40.126 --> 07:42.194
Can't hurt.

07:43.429 --> 07:44.763
Did last time.

07:46.499 --> 07:48.600
I'm so sorry, Keith.

07:48.668 --> 07:49.634
I'm sure she'll...

07:49.769 --> 07:52.170
No, Cora,
she's stubborn.

07:53.706 --> 07:55.907
And I, I really
screwed up, Diane.

07:56.042 --> 07:59.711
Guess I worked too hard.

07:59.779 --> 08:02.481
I was just trying
to make a living.

08:03.983 --> 08:04.850
I'm sorry.

08:04.984 --> 08:06.952
I already miss the kids
so much.

08:07.053 --> 08:09.354
I'm sure they miss you, too.

08:10.857 --> 08:13.758
I didn't mean to hurt them,

08:13.893 --> 08:15.026
or Cora.

08:15.194 --> 08:17.562
We all mess up.

08:17.730 --> 08:19.498
You should see my list.

08:22.368 --> 08:24.369
I should get back to work.

08:24.537 --> 08:26.171
Thank you so much.

08:26.339 --> 08:29.441
I just really needed
someone to talk to.

08:29.542 --> 08:31.209
Anytime.

08:36.215 --> 08:37.282
<i> Hold onto my arm.</i>

08:37.383 --> 08:38.783
<i> Here, hold on.</i>

09:07.547 --> 09:08.647
<i> You've reached
Cora Jesperson...</i>

09:34.874 --> 09:35.874
<i> You've reached
Cora Jesperson.</i>

09:36.008 --> 09:37.709
<i> Please leave a message.</i>

09:37.843 --> 09:39.711
Hey, Cora, it's me.

09:39.812 --> 09:41.413
Um...

09:41.480 --> 09:43.982
Just called to say I'm sorry.

09:44.050 --> 09:45.650
You know...

09:45.751 --> 09:47.752
I know I screwed up,

09:47.853 --> 09:51.856
but I wanted you to know
that I love you.

09:51.891 --> 09:54.059
And the kids.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.461
I never thought
I was a bad father or nothing,

09:56.596 --> 09:58.997
but I do understand
that I have to be a...

09:59.065 --> 10:01.433
better husband.

10:03.002 --> 10:03.935
So if it's all right,

10:04.103 --> 10:06.004
I'd like to come see you
at your folks.

10:06.105 --> 10:07.906
If that's all right.

10:08.007 --> 10:09.207
Let me know.

10:09.308 --> 10:10.208
Alright bye.

11:04.463 --> 11:07.866
So she walked out,
just like that?

11:07.967 --> 11:09.701
Just like that.

11:09.769 --> 11:12.170
You gotta get back
on that horse, pal.

11:26.786 --> 11:28.620
Nice shot.

11:28.721 --> 11:29.988
Thanks.

11:30.089 --> 11:30.989
I'm a natural.

11:31.123 --> 11:32.223
Yes, you are.

11:32.358 --> 11:33.692
What's your name?

11:33.826 --> 11:34.726
Sissy.

11:34.827 --> 11:36.661
Peyton.

11:36.796 --> 11:38.763
Sissy... I love that name.

11:38.831 --> 11:40.598
Oh, nice one.

11:40.666 --> 11:41.666
Really?

11:41.734 --> 11:42.634
Yeah.

11:45.171 --> 11:46.304
Where you from?

11:46.472 --> 11:48.273
I don't live too far.

11:48.407 --> 11:50.542
What's your name?

11:50.643 --> 11:51.376
Keith,

11:51.510 --> 11:52.877
which means
"of the forest."

11:53.012 --> 11:55.080
"Of the forest?"

11:55.214 --> 11:56.915
Like... bears?

11:58.284 --> 11:59.451
Yeah, like bears.

12:00.853 --> 12:03.088
I love bears.

12:04.156 --> 12:04.856
Really?

12:15.134 --> 12:18.136
Take it easy, papa bear.

12:22.608 --> 12:23.508
You want it off?

12:23.576 --> 12:24.843
Yeah.

12:24.977 --> 12:26.177
And what if I don't?

12:26.278 --> 12:29.180
Don't be like that.

12:29.281 --> 12:31.382
Ooh, the forest bear
doesn't like that.

12:33.719 --> 12:34.686
Why are you calling me that?

12:38.057 --> 12:40.325
Ooh, the forest bear is sad.

12:46.165 --> 12:50.935
I just had a really... bad day.

13:12.658 --> 13:13.825
Don't touch that.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.960
Ooh...

13:17.096 --> 13:17.962
Giddyup.

13:29.308 --> 13:31.509
I said, don't touch that.

13:37.516 --> 13:39.284
I said, put that down.

13:39.418 --> 13:41.352
Faster, faster,
they're getting away.

13:56.569 --> 13:58.403
You know what, Sissy?

14:01.841 --> 14:03.007
You talk too much.

16:15.441 --> 16:16.874
Giddyup.

16:31.924 --> 16:33.524
Greetings.

16:33.659 --> 16:35.593
How are you today?

16:35.694 --> 16:37.295
I hope I'm in focus.

16:37.429 --> 16:38.629
That would be a first.

16:40.699 --> 16:42.633
Okay, so let's get started.

16:42.768 --> 16:45.570
Why am I videotaping myself?

16:45.704 --> 16:46.604
Simple.

16:46.705 --> 16:49.007
I'm protecting my reputation.

16:49.108 --> 16:51.075
I want
a permanent record of me,

16:51.210 --> 16:52.643
and I don't want
some cheesy reporter

16:52.778 --> 16:54.379
getting it all wrong.

16:54.513 --> 16:55.446
To begin with,

16:55.581 --> 16:57.982
I've been misunderstood
my whole life.

16:58.050 --> 16:59.450
And I live with that pain,

16:59.585 --> 17:02.153
I try to not let it
get me down.

17:02.254 --> 17:03.988
But let me tell you,

17:04.089 --> 17:07.825
every now and then,
I get urges,

17:07.893 --> 17:11.695
and I finally acted on them.

17:11.829 --> 17:15.532
And it was...

17:15.567 --> 17:18.603
What's the word I'm looking for?

17:19.905 --> 17:21.439
Exciting.

18:13.826 --> 18:14.859
Agent Gand,

18:14.993 --> 18:16.894
the Bureau appreciates
the recent work you did

18:16.962 --> 18:18.596
on the prostitution ring
in Spokane.

18:18.730 --> 18:19.664
Thank you, sir.

18:19.798 --> 18:20.932
You made
all the difference.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.101
I need you
to do that again.

18:24.636 --> 18:26.404
A female body was
discovered in Washington,

18:26.605 --> 18:28.239
in a gorge
near the Oregon border.

18:32.244 --> 18:33.711
A happy face...

18:33.879 --> 18:35.379
Drawn in blood?

18:38.684 --> 18:40.518
It appears the murder
was committed in Oregon

18:40.652 --> 18:42.120
but the body
dumped in Washington.

18:42.154 --> 18:43.087
With a state line
crossed,

18:43.188 --> 18:44.322
that makes it
an FBI matter.

18:44.490 --> 18:45.256
Local police?

18:45.424 --> 18:47.458
Under-staffed,
over-confident.

18:47.593 --> 18:48.426
I need you to get up

18:48.527 --> 18:49.627
to Ruskin County,
Washington,

18:49.661 --> 18:50.761
Meet with Sheriff J.D. Cotton.

18:50.896 --> 18:51.629
Yes, sir.

18:51.797 --> 18:52.930
Just remember,

18:52.998 --> 18:54.532
we're playing chess,
they're playing checkers.

18:54.633 --> 18:57.335
Try to make them feel included.

18:57.436 --> 18:59.103
Solve this thing for us, Gand.

18:59.271 --> 19:01.873
Yes, sir.

19:10.616 --> 19:11.816
Are you sure you wanna
pack up all this stuff

19:11.950 --> 19:12.817
so soon?

19:12.918 --> 19:14.752
Cora will probably
change her mind.

19:14.853 --> 19:15.820
Cora won't even
return my phone calls,

19:15.954 --> 19:17.054
and I can't keep living here

19:17.222 --> 19:20.124
with all her stuff.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.029
Aw...

19:26.165 --> 19:27.665
Please tell me
this isn't yours.

19:27.799 --> 19:29.901
I didn't have the heart
to get rid of it.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.703
The kids just loved it
when they were younger.

19:32.771 --> 19:34.238
Yeah.

19:34.306 --> 19:35.306
Hey...

19:35.474 --> 19:36.974
What's this?

19:38.677 --> 19:39.677
It's really pretty.

19:45.184 --> 19:48.119
It's Cora's.

20:58.890 --> 21:01.092
Hey, sweetheart.
Where are you headed?

21:44.736 --> 21:46.103
Look, agent Gand,

21:46.238 --> 21:47.338
these jurisdiction cases

21:47.506 --> 21:49.607
are usually just too many folks
at the same party.

21:49.775 --> 21:51.042
It's an interstate matter.

21:51.176 --> 21:52.610
The law is the law.

21:52.711 --> 21:53.978
Yeah, I've heard that.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.012
Felicia,

21:55.113 --> 21:57.181
can we get
some coffee?

21:58.183 --> 22:00.384
With all due respect,
agent Gand,

22:00.552 --> 22:01.519
I actually have
done this before,

22:01.687 --> 22:03.954
so you being here,
it may be overkill.

22:04.122 --> 22:05.790
The government prefers
to be thorough.

22:05.957 --> 22:08.426
Well, good for them.

22:08.527 --> 22:10.061
Uh, how do you take
your coffee,

22:10.228 --> 22:11.195
special agent Gand?

22:11.363 --> 22:12.630
That's okay, hon,
I can take it from here.

22:12.798 --> 22:13.764
I think we can
figure out coffee,

22:13.899 --> 22:16.167
we've got an FBI agent
on the premises.

22:16.301 --> 22:17.668
How long you been an FBI agent?

22:17.769 --> 22:19.370
11 years.

22:19.471 --> 22:20.504
Ah, is that right?

22:20.639 --> 22:22.306
Well, I've been
sheriff of this county 17.

22:22.407 --> 22:23.941
Every time
there's a murder,

22:24.042 --> 22:25.276
six in the last nine years,

22:25.410 --> 22:26.177
I've caught 'em
and got convictions.

22:26.311 --> 22:27.445
That's very impressive.

22:27.512 --> 22:30.081
Look, if Uncle Sam wants
to waste taxpayer money

22:30.248 --> 22:32.016
bringing in the FBI,
I can't stop him.

22:32.150 --> 22:33.684
But this isn't
Mayberry,

22:33.852 --> 22:36.787
and I'm not Andy.

22:38.657 --> 22:40.057
I'd like to see the body.

22:51.737 --> 22:53.070
Her blood?

22:53.238 --> 22:54.638
Yeah.

22:54.673 --> 22:56.107
I can also confirm

22:56.174 --> 22:57.942
time of death was
48 to 56 hours ago,

22:57.976 --> 22:58.876
agent Gand.

22:59.044 --> 23:00.211
We still haven't I.D.d her.

23:00.345 --> 23:01.145
FBI will run

23:01.279 --> 23:02.513
a thorough
DNA match.

23:02.681 --> 23:03.781
And look at this.

23:03.882 --> 23:06.884
From a place
called "O' Finn's Tavern,"

23:06.985 --> 23:09.153
in Portland.

23:10.756 --> 23:11.622
Whoever did this
has strong hands.

23:11.757 --> 23:13.324
The wounds
all indicate that.

23:13.492 --> 23:15.192
The strangulation marks

23:15.360 --> 23:16.560
are pretty severe.

23:16.661 --> 23:17.828
Euphoric rage.

23:17.929 --> 23:20.030
The murderer
savors the struggle.

23:20.098 --> 23:21.799
It's highly personal,
no weapons used.

23:21.933 --> 23:23.134
It's intimate.

23:23.235 --> 23:25.035
I'll need you to check
for latent prints

23:25.203 --> 23:26.637
in the blood
on this marking here.

23:26.805 --> 23:28.506
You got it.

23:29.374 --> 23:30.541
A happy face...

23:32.010 --> 23:33.210
It's a taunt.

23:33.378 --> 23:34.678
He thinks he's smarter
than everybody else,

23:34.846 --> 23:36.547
that he can't get caught.

23:36.681 --> 23:38.582
Any leads, Sheriff?

23:38.717 --> 23:40.351
So far,
we got three clues.

23:40.485 --> 23:41.685
One, the bloody
happy face.

23:41.853 --> 23:43.988
Two, the stamp on the back
of the victim's hand

23:44.055 --> 23:45.456
from "O' Finn's Tavern,"

23:45.624 --> 23:46.557
which tells us
she was in Oregon

23:46.725 --> 23:47.558
when she was murdered,

23:47.692 --> 23:48.592
and three,

23:48.727 --> 23:50.127
the zipper from her jeans
was cut-out.

23:50.228 --> 23:52.196
Probably a souvenir
for the killer.

23:52.264 --> 23:53.464
I've seen that before.

23:53.565 --> 23:55.733
May also be a deliberately
false detail to distract us.

23:55.867 --> 23:57.168
Well, even still,

23:57.302 --> 23:59.136
we find who has
that part of her jeans,

23:59.204 --> 24:00.271
he might be our killer.

24:00.305 --> 24:02.540
We have to contact
the police in Portland,

24:02.641 --> 24:04.608
see who's been
reported missing.

24:04.676 --> 24:05.743
I'll have my team
investigate the dump site

24:05.844 --> 24:07.011
here in Washington.

24:14.886 --> 24:16.620
That looks delicious.

24:17.789 --> 24:18.789
Well, it's
a treat for me.

24:18.890 --> 24:20.991
I don't get to bake
for anyone anymore.

24:21.092 --> 24:22.526
I can't tell you

24:22.594 --> 24:25.329
the last time I had
a home-cooked meal.

24:25.397 --> 24:28.199
I mean, all I eat
on the road is junk.

24:28.300 --> 24:31.402
How you holding up?

24:32.771 --> 24:34.605
I'm all right, I mean...

24:34.673 --> 24:36.340
It's a little weird
living here alone,

24:36.441 --> 24:38.676
but I'm not one to complain.

24:40.812 --> 24:42.146
Forks!

24:43.181 --> 24:44.482
Sure.

24:44.549 --> 24:45.616
Yeah...

25:17.015 --> 25:18.082
Is that you,
Jesperson?

25:20.018 --> 25:22.753
I thought you two
were honeymooning in Honolulu.

25:23.755 --> 25:24.722
This guy...

25:24.856 --> 25:26.557
Good one.

25:26.725 --> 25:28.759
Hey, hey,

25:28.894 --> 25:30.561
it's the Mountie!

25:32.330 --> 25:33.497
I know you?

25:33.632 --> 25:36.333
You still keep that stupid
postcard of Dudley Do-Right

25:36.401 --> 25:37.268
on your visor?

25:38.403 --> 25:40.437
Hey, I got myself
a new boyfriend,

25:40.572 --> 25:42.039
and it's the real thing,

25:42.207 --> 25:44.275
And I'm going to go
out on the road with him.

25:45.510 --> 25:48.078
And let me tell you something,
Mr. Mountie,

25:48.246 --> 25:51.148
weirdo truck driver man...

25:51.216 --> 25:55.586
He's screwing me
way better than you.

26:12.771 --> 26:14.605
I remember you now.

26:14.773 --> 26:19.143
You are the one
that always wears a flea collar.

26:27.686 --> 26:31.221
<i> Maybe I'm too sensitive
sometimes,</i>

26:31.356 --> 26:35.826
but when people get cute
and sarcastic with me,

26:35.927 --> 26:37.194
I see red.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.231
<i> And that's when
they have to pay.</i>

26:41.333 --> 26:43.968
And if I don't get
the respect I'm due,

26:44.069 --> 26:48.172
<i> it's gonna go downhill
real fast.</i>

26:50.008 --> 26:51.175
Do you recognize this girl?

26:56.915 --> 26:57.748
No.

26:57.882 --> 26:59.016
Really?

26:59.150 --> 27:01.151
Because she had your bar's name
stamped on her hand.

27:01.219 --> 27:02.987
It's not my business.

27:04.990 --> 27:06.090
See, that's unfortunate,

27:06.191 --> 27:07.625
for you.

27:07.692 --> 27:09.460
Because by not cooperating
with an FBI agent,

27:09.594 --> 27:10.461
I could arrest you

27:10.662 --> 27:11.528
for impeding
a federal investigation

27:11.596 --> 27:14.298
which has a penalty,
last time I looked,

27:14.466 --> 27:15.833
of five years in prison.

27:15.967 --> 27:17.768
Or...

27:17.969 --> 27:19.403
I could give you
a second chance.

27:19.604 --> 27:21.605
Since I don't want
your stupid ass

27:21.706 --> 27:23.841
clogging up the justice system.

27:24.809 --> 27:26.710
Which would you prefer?

27:32.050 --> 27:33.817
She used to come around here.

27:33.918 --> 27:35.919
She was in the other night,
she left with some guy.

27:36.054 --> 27:38.022
What's her name?

27:39.357 --> 27:41.792
Sissy Peyton.

27:42.894 --> 27:45.062
Thank you.

27:57.809 --> 27:58.676
Hey, Di.

27:58.777 --> 27:59.910
Miss me?

28:00.045 --> 28:01.645
<i> I've been
thinking of you all day.</i>

28:02.914 --> 28:04.515
I miss you, too.

28:04.649 --> 28:06.550
How long are you
going to be away for?

28:06.718 --> 28:07.518
<i> I'll be home in a few days.</i>

28:07.652 --> 28:08.585
<i> Oh.</i>

28:08.753 --> 28:11.188
<i> Yeah, that's great.</i>

28:11.289 --> 28:12.423
Listen, it's getting
a little busy,

28:12.424 --> 28:14.424
<i> I'm gonna have to jump back on the road.</i>

28:14.850 --> 28:15.225
<i> I'll call you later.</i>

28:15.226 --> 28:16.093
Okay.

28:16.227 --> 28:19.063
<i> Um... uh, take care,</i>

28:19.164 --> 28:20.864
<i> and we'll talk soon.</i>

28:20.965 --> 28:21.932
Bye.

28:22.067 --> 28:23.567
Bye.

28:25.270 --> 28:27.771
Nice rig.

28:31.876 --> 28:33.043
Where you headed?

28:33.144 --> 28:34.978
I was hoping to get
to the market today,

28:35.113 --> 28:36.914
get her formula.

28:38.016 --> 28:40.651
The least I could do
is give a mother a lift.

28:40.785 --> 28:41.819
Yeah?

28:41.886 --> 28:44.388
That's sweet.

28:44.489 --> 28:46.990
My name's Candy.

28:49.060 --> 28:51.528
Candy.

28:58.737 --> 28:59.737
That's her.

28:59.904 --> 29:01.405
That's Sissy.

29:01.573 --> 29:03.674
Can you cover her, please?

29:10.115 --> 29:12.249
It was just
a matter of time.

29:12.417 --> 29:14.451
Now I won't have to worry
about her anymore.

29:14.552 --> 29:16.053
I'm sorry, Ms. Peyton,

29:16.187 --> 29:17.087
she didn't deserve this.

29:17.188 --> 29:19.189
Who did it?

29:19.324 --> 29:22.826
We're doing our best
to find out.

29:28.967 --> 29:29.867
May I help you?

29:30.969 --> 29:33.337
I know who killed
Sissy Peyton.

29:35.907 --> 29:37.407
How do you
know that?

29:37.475 --> 29:39.576
I was there.

29:39.644 --> 29:41.078
Me and my boyfriend.

29:44.048 --> 29:46.316
We did it.

29:52.223 --> 29:53.724
FBI. Are you Bud Skinner?

29:53.858 --> 29:55.392
Yeah.

29:56.294 --> 29:57.461
Hey, whoa.

29:59.197 --> 30:00.631
Hey...

30:02.133 --> 30:03.867
Mr. Skinner,
you're under arrest

30:03.968 --> 30:05.569
for the murder
of Sissy Peyton.

30:05.703 --> 30:06.970
Murder!
Are you kidding me?

31:05.897 --> 31:07.331
Thank you.

31:07.465 --> 31:09.466
I'm sorry.

31:12.003 --> 31:15.172
150 sound about right?

31:15.306 --> 31:18.342
I just offered
to take you to the market.

31:18.443 --> 31:20.611
I didn't ask you
to do that.

31:20.712 --> 31:21.778
I made you feel good.

31:21.913 --> 31:23.347
Now you're making me feel bad.

31:25.650 --> 31:26.817
Well, how about this?

31:29.787 --> 31:30.654
I give you $20

31:30.755 --> 31:32.122
so you can buy formula

31:32.190 --> 31:33.924
for your baby,

31:34.025 --> 31:36.426
and you get
outta my truck.

31:36.527 --> 31:37.461
I know what I'm worth.

31:37.528 --> 31:39.463
I'm good at what I do.

31:40.565 --> 31:41.632
I'm calling the cops

31:41.733 --> 31:43.166
and telling 'em you raped me,
you loser.

31:46.471 --> 31:48.038
Are you gonna pay me
or not, you freak?

31:58.149 --> 31:59.383
No...

32:01.719 --> 32:03.587
Please don't hurt me.

32:07.225 --> 32:09.026
Please, don't hurt me!

32:25.143 --> 32:26.810
Leave.

34:38.775 --> 34:40.811
Hey!

34:42.045 --> 34:43.013
Don't be mad.

34:45.382 --> 34:46.817
What are you doing here?

34:48.252 --> 34:50.554
I missed you,
I missed the kids.

34:51.722 --> 34:53.857
Okay, look,
I want you to leave.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.128
Okay.

34:58.296 --> 35:00.464
Can I just see 'em?

35:00.631 --> 35:03.066
Just for a second, please?

35:04.102 --> 35:06.303
Please.

35:06.337 --> 35:08.338
Okay.

35:11.476 --> 35:13.243
But after that,
I really want you to leave.

35:13.311 --> 35:15.479
All right.

35:15.646 --> 35:16.880
Okay.

35:17.048 --> 35:18.782
Thank you.

35:21.886 --> 35:22.919
Kids?

35:22.920 --> 35:23.920
Your father's here.

35:26.224 --> 35:27.124
Dad!

35:27.291 --> 35:28.758
Hey, buddy,
how are you?

35:28.860 --> 35:29.860
Daddy!

35:29.927 --> 35:31.661
I missed you so much.

35:31.729 --> 35:33.797
Look, I got you
presents, look.

35:33.898 --> 35:35.332
Ladies first.
Thanks daddy!

35:35.433 --> 35:37.968
And I got you a new glove.
Awesome!

35:38.102 --> 35:39.269
How you guys been?

35:39.403 --> 35:40.036
Good.

35:40.138 --> 35:41.037
Come here,
come here.

35:54.185 --> 35:56.753
Delores, tell me again
what happened.

35:57.788 --> 35:58.622
John called,

35:58.756 --> 36:01.091
said he picked up
this girl at a bar

36:01.192 --> 36:04.261
so that we could have
a three-way, and...

36:04.295 --> 36:05.762
Things got rough,

36:05.830 --> 36:08.198
and he raped her.

36:08.232 --> 36:09.366
He killed her,

36:09.433 --> 36:10.767
and we dumped her body
off the highway

36:10.835 --> 36:11.801
near the Columbia gorge.

36:11.869 --> 36:13.870
What's really
going on here, Delores?

36:13.938 --> 36:15.739
Are you just
saying this

36:15.806 --> 36:17.841
because
Bud treats you bad,

36:17.909 --> 36:18.875
he beats you,

36:19.010 --> 36:20.143
you want to pin this on him
as payback?

36:21.746 --> 36:23.046
He'll get what he deserves
for what he's done.

36:23.214 --> 36:24.514
To you or to Sissy?

36:30.354 --> 36:31.454
How did he kill her?

36:31.622 --> 36:32.522
Rope.

36:32.690 --> 36:34.291
What else?

36:34.458 --> 36:36.626
Gloves.

36:36.794 --> 36:37.727
Duct tape.

36:37.828 --> 36:39.996
Like the ones I found
in your apartment?

36:40.131 --> 36:41.298
It was almost like you wanted me

36:41.465 --> 36:42.933
to find that stuff.

36:43.034 --> 36:44.034
Bud must've hid it.

36:45.369 --> 36:46.269
Ask him.

36:46.404 --> 36:47.370
Delores,

36:47.538 --> 36:48.805
if you're trying to set up
an innocent man...

36:48.973 --> 36:51.241
He's not innocent.

36:53.411 --> 36:54.711
Of anything.

36:54.845 --> 36:57.013
Tell me about the signature left
on Sissy's body.

36:58.182 --> 37:01.117
What does it mean,
whose idea was it?

37:03.387 --> 37:04.721
Delores...

37:06.157 --> 37:07.624
I know what you're doing.

37:07.792 --> 37:10.026
I understand
why you're doing it.

37:10.161 --> 37:12.963
But Bud didn't
kill this girl.

37:13.097 --> 37:15.665
The real killer
is still out there

37:15.766 --> 37:17.400
and he is going to
kill again.

37:18.836 --> 37:20.337
Please help me.

37:23.307 --> 37:25.709
I've told you
everything I know.

37:26.877 --> 37:28.078
<i> So, get this.</i>

37:28.179 --> 37:31.615
Some whack-job
named Delores Parnicke

37:31.749 --> 37:32.983
<i> told the cops</i>

37:33.050 --> 37:35.585
that her and her boyfriend
killed Sissy Peyton,

37:35.686 --> 37:38.355
which is a miracle,

37:38.389 --> 37:40.023
since they didn't!

37:40.157 --> 37:40.957
I did!

37:41.058 --> 37:42.525
I killed her!

37:42.627 --> 37:46.263
They're trying to take
the damn credit?

37:46.397 --> 37:49.299
It was me.

37:51.535 --> 37:52.769
Yeah?

37:52.937 --> 37:54.671
Someone found this
on the bathroom wall

37:54.805 --> 37:55.672
at a truck stop in Burlington.

37:55.773 --> 37:57.841
Cops there took these.

38:13.491 --> 38:14.658
Felicia...

38:15.760 --> 38:17.260
See if any of the papers
ever mentioned

38:17.395 --> 38:20.330
the missing zipper
from Sissy's pants?

38:24.769 --> 38:25.802
Hey.

38:26.771 --> 38:27.671
Can you...

38:27.738 --> 38:28.638
Can you sit
for a minute?

38:28.739 --> 38:29.639
Please?

38:29.807 --> 38:31.141
Sure.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.142
Good.

38:33.144 --> 38:36.212
I thought maybe
you forgot about me.

38:36.280 --> 38:37.914
What have you been up to?

38:38.082 --> 38:39.015
Not much.

38:39.183 --> 38:41.151
Just driving around,

38:41.218 --> 38:42.452
thinking.

38:42.653 --> 38:44.087
Oh, yeah?
About what?

38:44.288 --> 38:46.289
Well, I've been mostly
thinking about me...

38:46.390 --> 38:50.160
and you.

38:52.330 --> 38:53.330
Wow.

38:56.967 --> 38:58.001
I really want you

38:58.069 --> 39:01.004
to spend more time
at my place.

39:01.172 --> 39:04.808
I just feel so much better
when you're there.

39:04.942 --> 39:08.611
Everything is better.

39:10.014 --> 39:11.681
Okay.

39:21.759 --> 39:23.159
You lost me,
agent Gand.

39:23.227 --> 39:25.762
Someone writes a confession
on a bathroom wall,

39:25.796 --> 39:28.231
and you consider that
evidence left by the killer?

39:28.332 --> 39:31.201
It had details
only the killer would know.

39:31.268 --> 39:33.636
Delores couldn't even describe
the happy face signature.

39:33.704 --> 39:34.904
It's circumstantial.

39:35.039 --> 39:36.072
Call me old-fashioned,

39:36.173 --> 39:38.308
but I like my evidence
in the real and hard variety.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.944
<i> Listen, agent Gand,
as district attorney,</i>

39:41.112 --> 39:42.812
<i> I see a lot of guilt
and innocence</i>

39:42.947 --> 39:43.813
<i> coming and going,</i>

39:43.914 --> 39:45.048
<i> and on this one,</i>

39:45.182 --> 39:46.216
<i> the fat lady has sung,</i>

39:46.384 --> 39:48.752
<i> and her name
is Delores Parnicke.</i>

39:48.853 --> 39:50.220
Now, she signed a confession,

39:50.287 --> 39:51.187
stating her involvement

39:51.355 --> 39:52.288
in the killing
of Sissy Peyton.

39:52.423 --> 39:53.690
Innocent people
confess.

39:53.758 --> 39:54.691
So do guilty people.

39:54.825 --> 39:55.725
I think she's lying.

39:55.826 --> 39:56.826
Really? Why?

39:56.994 --> 39:58.061
What then,

39:58.262 --> 39:59.529
she read about Sissy's murder?

39:59.597 --> 40:00.663
Why confess to something
she didn't do?

40:00.765 --> 40:02.565
She wanted out.

40:02.700 --> 40:03.800
I found a book
in their apartment

40:03.934 --> 40:05.668
about how to leave
an abusive relationship.

40:05.803 --> 40:08.738
<i> She formulated a plan,
she implicated her boyfriend.</i>

40:10.040 --> 40:12.776
<i> I believe that she planted
evidence in their apartment.</i>

40:12.943 --> 40:14.277
<i> Here's the thing, agent Gand,</i>

40:14.445 --> 40:16.579
if you want to get Delores
and her boyfriend, Bud Skinner,

40:16.747 --> 40:17.647
out of jail,

40:17.748 --> 40:19.649
then you're going to have to
work harder,

40:19.750 --> 40:22.252
and give me some evidence
that actually means something.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.053
I'm on your side,

40:24.155 --> 40:25.588
and I'm all for truth
and justice,

40:25.756 --> 40:29.159
but I like evidence
even better.

40:30.294 --> 40:31.694
Yeah?

40:33.063 --> 40:34.130
Thanks.

40:46.143 --> 40:47.277
Bud Skinner
failed his polygraph.

40:50.414 --> 40:52.282
Convinced?

42:33.450 --> 42:36.452
I won't let him
get away with this, Summer,

42:36.520 --> 42:37.987
I promise you.

42:38.956 --> 42:41.024
Agent Gand.

42:52.420 --> 42:54.025
"I killed Sissy
and I did this one too.

42:54.026 --> 42:56.750
Maybe this time you
believe I am still out here"

42:58.208 --> 43:02.445
Really starting
to piss me off.

43:26.737 --> 43:28.004
Hi.

43:28.172 --> 43:29.505
Hi.

43:31.709 --> 43:34.877
This may sound crazy but,

43:35.012 --> 43:36.312
the last few weeks

43:36.480 --> 43:38.715
have been some of
the best days of my life.

43:38.816 --> 43:41.684
And there's just something
inside me changing.

43:41.752 --> 43:43.553
What do you mean?

43:46.323 --> 43:47.757
I'm falling
in love with you.

43:47.925 --> 43:49.092
I am in love with you,

43:49.259 --> 43:50.560
and I hope you feel
the same way about me.

43:50.694 --> 43:53.296
Yeah. I do.

43:53.430 --> 43:55.865
I just was afraid
to say it first.

43:57.501 --> 44:00.003
Okay, so,
once these papers are signed,

44:00.170 --> 44:02.238
I'd love to get married again.

44:03.240 --> 44:04.407
What are you saying?

44:06.110 --> 44:08.378
Well, if you'll have me...

44:11.048 --> 44:12.048
Will you be my wife?

44:14.685 --> 44:15.718
Yes!

44:15.853 --> 44:17.153
Yeah?

44:17.221 --> 44:18.655
Yes!

44:32.002 --> 44:33.803
<i> Now the latest</i>

44:33.971 --> 44:36.339
<i> in the brutal slaying
of Sissy Peyton.</i>

44:36.407 --> 44:38.975
<i> Delores Parnicke has confessed</i>

44:39.076 --> 44:41.377
<i>that her boyfriend
Bud Skinner killed Peyton,</i>

44:41.512 --> 44:43.479
<i> and that Parnicke
was an eyewitness.</i>

44:43.547 --> 44:44.781
<i> According to authorities,</i>

44:44.948 --> 44:46.482
<i> Skinner has denied
the allegations.</i>

44:46.617 --> 44:47.784
<i> The lurid case</i>

44:47.885 --> 44:49.719
<i> has brought notoriety
to Parnicke</i>

44:49.887 --> 44:51.788
<i> for her role
as the alleged accomplice</i>

44:51.955 --> 44:53.589
<i> in this brutal slaying...</i>

44:53.724 --> 44:55.758
They've got it all wrong.

45:02.329 --> 45:03.200
I did it!

45:19.450 --> 45:22.819
<i> "I would
like to tell my story.</i>

45:22.920 --> 45:24.087
<i> I am two people,</i>

45:24.221 --> 45:27.690
<i> and sometimes
the bad one is in charge.</i>

45:27.791 --> 45:31.194
<i> When I'm my bad self,
women better be careful.</i>

45:31.361 --> 45:33.196
<i> Remember Sissy Peyton?</i>

45:34.331 --> 45:36.899
<i> Met her at O' Finn's Tavern</i>

45:37.000 --> 45:39.469
<i> and raped her
and beat her up real bad...</i>

45:42.406 --> 45:43.372
<i> I strangled her</i>

45:43.440 --> 45:45.808
<i> and ended her life.</i>

45:47.269 --> 45:49.100
<i> This turned me on.
I got high.</i>

45:49.646 --> 45:53.649
<i> Painted a happy face
on her chest.</i>

45:55.119 --> 45:55.985
<i> "Told you it was time</i>

45:56.086 --> 45:57.120

46:04.928 --> 46:06.662
<i> "Met another one

46:06.797 --> 46:09.532
<i> Summer Northern.</i>

46:09.600 --> 46:12.201
<i>Long brown hair, country girl.</i>

46:12.302 --> 46:14.504
<i> My mind went wild</i>

46:14.638 --> 46:16.339
<i> with the thought
of a sex slave.</i>

46:16.473 --> 46:19.475
<i> Told her she was gonna die</i>

46:19.576 --> 46:24.147
<i> and slowly strangled her

46:24.314 --> 46:27.116
<i> I felt so much power...</i>

46:27.284 --> 46:29.185
<i> Dropped the body

<i> you are wrong.</i>

46:44.768 --> 46:48.104
<i> It was me."</i>

47:25.909 --> 47:27.944
Hi.

47:28.111 --> 47:29.779
Is everything okay?

47:29.947 --> 47:32.315
Yeah.

47:32.482 --> 47:34.884
Everything's fine.

47:34.952 --> 47:38.354
I miss you so much
when you're on the road.

47:38.488 --> 47:40.756
I miss you, too.

47:54.771 --> 47:55.872
I brought you
some coffee.

47:56.073 --> 47:58.074
Oh, thank you.

48:00.077 --> 48:04.280
It's personal
with you, isn't it?

48:04.448 --> 48:06.716
Yes.

48:07.784 --> 48:09.585
Two years
after I became an agent,

48:09.753 --> 48:11.053
my sister Alison was murdered.

48:13.056 --> 48:17.493
She had just gotten married,
and, one day, she went missing.

48:17.594 --> 48:19.495
I don't even really know
what happened.

48:19.630 --> 48:20.930
I never found out who did it.

48:22.399 --> 48:25.001
I'm sorry.

48:28.972 --> 48:30.473
You asked me to check
the papers

48:30.607 --> 48:33.209
to see if Sissy's zipper
was ever mentioned.

48:33.377 --> 48:35.177
It wasn't.

48:42.119 --> 48:44.153
-You got a sec?
-Yeah.

48:44.221 --> 48:45.288
These letters just came in.

48:45.389 --> 48:47.023
Showed up on my desk
and sent to the papers.

48:47.124 --> 48:49.325
Written by some nut,
signed with a happy face.

48:54.865 --> 48:56.899
It's not some nut, it's him.

48:58.735 --> 48:59.535
When are you
going to let this go?

48:59.670 --> 49:00.970
The FBI lab confirmed

49:01.104 --> 49:02.838
handwriting on the plywood
by Summer's body,

49:02.973 --> 49:04.674
the handwriting in
the truck stop restroom

49:04.775 --> 49:05.741
were a match.

49:05.876 --> 49:07.610
Now, Bud and Delores
were in custody

49:07.744 --> 49:08.611
when Summer was murdered.

49:08.779 --> 49:09.578
How do you explain that?

49:09.713 --> 49:11.247
It's a copycat.

49:11.348 --> 49:13.182
But the scrawl in the restroom
mentioned the missing zipper.

49:13.250 --> 49:14.517
That's a detail
only the killer would know.

49:14.651 --> 49:19.188
That is very interesting,
but it doesn't change anything.

49:19.256 --> 49:21.557
I've got some other news.

49:21.625 --> 49:23.426
Bud has entered a plea.

49:23.560 --> 49:24.927
He's agreed to 15 years.

49:25.062 --> 49:26.862
Now, does that
sound like something

49:26.964 --> 49:28.064
an innocent man would do?

49:28.165 --> 49:30.166
The only thing I know

49:30.267 --> 49:34.070
is that the person who did this
is still out there.

49:35.272 --> 49:36.939
Well unless you can prove it,
we're done here.

49:37.074 --> 49:39.909
Delores has confessed.

49:40.043 --> 49:41.143
Bud has pled.

49:41.278 --> 49:45.314
This is over, agent Gand.

49:53.357 --> 49:55.491
<i> In a case
that continues to astound,</i>

49:55.559 --> 49:58.127
<i> authorities have confirmed</i>

49:58.228 --> 49:59.595
<i> that Bud Skinner
murdered Sissy Peyton</i>

49:59.663 --> 50:02.431
<i> as his girlfriend,
Delores Parnicke watched,</i>

50:02.499 --> 50:04.533
<i> but troubling
new twists have surfaced,</i>

50:04.701 --> 50:05.634
<i> and it now appears</i>

50:05.702 --> 50:07.403
<i> someone dubbed
the "Happy Face Killer"</i>

50:07.537 --> 50:09.438
<i> is taking credit
for the murder,</i>

50:09.573 --> 50:10.473
<i> as well as others,</i>

50:10.640 --> 50:14.210
<i> and may or may not be
a copycat.</i>

50:17.080 --> 50:18.781
<i> Whatever the truth is,</i>

50:18.882 --> 50:21.117
<i> the entire pacific northwest
is on edge,</i>

50:21.251 --> 50:24.153
<i> and asking itself,
who is the "Happy Face Killer?"</i>

50:38.435 --> 50:41.737
A letter just came
for you, agent Gand.

50:52.749 --> 50:55.017
<i> "Dear FBI agent Gand.</i>

50:55.118 --> 50:57.987
<i> I've written
to everybody else,</i>

50:58.055 --> 50:59.088
<i> and I read in the paper</i>

50:59.256 --> 51:00.589
<i> about how you are
the lead investigator,</i>

51:00.724 --> 51:04.360
<i> so maybe
you will listen to me.</i>

51:04.428 --> 51:08.164
<i> Skinner and Parnicke had
nothing to do with anything,</i>

51:08.231 --> 51:11.300
<i> and they are pathetic liars.</i>

51:11.501 --> 51:12.468
<i> It was all me,</i>

51:12.569 --> 51:15.938
<i> and I feel like
I'm being treated wrong."</i>

51:17.140 --> 51:18.274
<i> I hope you believe me.</i>

51:18.442 --> 51:22.678
<i> I deserve that,
because I'm telling the truth.</i>

51:22.813 --> 51:25.948
<i> Maybe sometime we could meet.</i>

51:26.083 --> 51:29.452
<i> Good luck with everything.</i>

51:29.586 --> 51:31.454
<i> More to come.</i>

51:31.621 --> 51:33.622
<i> Sincerely yours."</i>

52:09.860 --> 52:11.060
Cotton.

52:12.395 --> 52:13.762
We need to interview people

52:13.897 --> 52:15.664
at the truck stops
along the interstate.

52:56.373 --> 52:58.841
Have a nice day.

53:30.874 --> 53:31.640
Hey, Di.

53:31.841 --> 53:32.942
Hi. Honey, I was thinking

53:33.109 --> 53:34.710
that we could have our honeymoon
in Lake Tahoe

53:34.844 --> 53:37.446
Oh. Yeah.

53:41.351 --> 53:43.485
Yeah, that...

53:43.587 --> 53:44.787
That sounds great.

53:44.888 --> 53:45.921
<i> And when we're married,</i>

53:45.989 --> 53:47.356
I could quit my job

53:47.424 --> 53:49.258
and ride in the truck
with you, and...

53:49.359 --> 53:51.193
<i> go everywhere you go.</i>

53:51.261 --> 53:52.995
Yeah, well,
let's talk about that.

53:53.964 --> 53:55.030
Okay.

53:55.131 --> 53:55.931
<i> Listen, sweetie, I gotta run.</i>

53:56.099 --> 53:58.300
Talk to you later.

54:12.782 --> 54:13.882
That was nice, sweetie.

54:25.395 --> 54:27.029
I'd recognize
that ass anywhere.

54:27.197 --> 54:28.464
Oh, my god, Keith,

54:28.531 --> 54:30.099
I was just thinking about you.

54:30.166 --> 54:31.533
How you been?

54:31.601 --> 54:33.402
Busy.

54:34.504 --> 54:35.571
So, where you headed?

54:36.506 --> 54:37.473
Everywhere.

54:37.607 --> 54:38.774
Ah, imagine that.

54:38.875 --> 54:40.743
That's where I'm headed.

54:42.412 --> 54:44.546
As long as you aren't
the Happy Face Killer.

54:46.783 --> 54:50.653
Darlin', do I look like
the Happy Face Killer?

54:50.754 --> 54:51.654
You're good...

54:51.855 --> 54:52.788
Ooh!

54:52.956 --> 54:54.757
You look good, baby.

54:54.858 --> 54:56.225
You been exercising?

54:56.326 --> 54:57.793
Here and there.

54:58.895 --> 55:00.029
Ooh, great postcard.

55:00.130 --> 55:01.563
I love Mounties.

55:01.698 --> 55:04.667
Yeah.

55:04.801 --> 55:06.101
I remember.

55:09.673 --> 55:12.708
I met him at a truck stop
in Mount Ruskin.

55:12.876 --> 55:14.710
I was with my baby.

55:14.778 --> 55:16.879
Me and him were
gonna party in his rig.

55:19.182 --> 55:23.719
He tried to strangle me,
but I got away.

55:25.689 --> 55:27.089
Is your baby all right?

55:29.092 --> 55:31.660
Other than having me
for a mother?

55:31.728 --> 55:32.661
Yeah, she's fine.

55:32.796 --> 55:35.264
Candy,

55:35.365 --> 55:37.533
are you willing
to press assault charges

55:37.701 --> 55:39.201
against him?

55:44.941 --> 55:46.675
Do you know his name?

55:49.879 --> 55:52.781
Keith Jesperson.

56:04.127 --> 56:05.160
You're still the best.

56:05.295 --> 56:07.329
That's not what you said

56:07.397 --> 56:08.797
last time.

56:08.865 --> 56:09.865
Come on, no way.

56:09.933 --> 56:12.134
No, you did, you insulted me,

56:12.268 --> 56:14.336
and the Mountie postcard
I have clipped on my visor.

56:15.338 --> 56:16.839
You had no right
to do that.

56:16.940 --> 56:18.874
Insensitivity
is the modern plague.

56:19.042 --> 56:21.977
It brings out
the worst in people.

56:23.613 --> 56:26.148
So, uh, I'll just get a cab.

56:27.851 --> 56:31.920
No, no you won't.

57:33.650 --> 57:36.518
<i> They say abusive behavior
toward animals</i>

57:36.653 --> 57:37.853
<i> is one of the first symptoms</i>

57:37.987 --> 57:39.488
<i> that you're on the road
to becoming a serial killer,</i>

57:39.622 --> 57:40.589
<i> or a murderer.</i>

57:42.192 --> 57:44.326
<i> And you know, I never
thought of it that way.</i>

57:44.394 --> 57:47.629
<i> I never thought of it,
like, I was abusing animals.</i>

57:47.697 --> 57:51.400
<i> I just enjoyed it.
I enjoyed watching them die.</i>

57:51.534 --> 57:53.135
<i> When I looked at those things,</i>

57:53.236 --> 57:55.471
<i> that are so scared
and trembling,</i>

57:55.538 --> 57:58.173
<i> and just watch the life
leave them...</i>

57:58.274 --> 58:02.077
<i> I got off on it.</i>

58:02.145 --> 58:04.079
<i> Just like I did with Taffy.</i>

58:04.247 --> 58:06.348
<i> Anyway, there isn't
much difference</i>

58:06.483 --> 58:10.052
<i> between killing an animal
and killing a human being.</i>

58:10.153 --> 58:12.721
<i> I mean, you get to the point</i>

58:12.789 --> 58:14.590
<i> where killing something
is nothing.</i>

58:14.691 --> 58:15.624
<i> Let's face it,</i>

58:15.658 --> 58:19.995
<i> being alive
is what kicks your ass.</i>

58:20.063 --> 58:21.063
So...

58:21.164 --> 58:23.465
<i> Be careful out there.</i>

58:23.566 --> 58:25.467
<i> Look over your shoulder,</i>

58:25.535 --> 58:28.770
<i> because I may be closer
than you think.</i>

58:30.573 --> 58:31.740
Hunters say

58:31.875 --> 58:34.977
their dogs
found the body.

58:44.721 --> 58:45.954
There's no happy face.

58:46.089 --> 58:48.357
Might not be him.

58:48.491 --> 58:49.324
It's him.

58:49.459 --> 58:51.426
He's just doing it different.

59:37.707 --> 59:40.442
Mr. Jesperson,

59:40.577 --> 59:43.045
I'm FBI special agent
Melinda Gand.

59:43.146 --> 59:47.115
Well, it's an honor
to meet anyone from the FBI.

59:47.183 --> 59:49.051
You can call me Keith.

59:49.152 --> 59:50.319
Okay.

59:52.088 --> 59:53.722
We brought you in today
to ask some questions.

59:53.823 --> 59:55.757
We appreciate
your cooperation.

59:55.892 --> 59:59.027
You mind
if I record this?

59:59.062 --> 01:00:00.963
Fire away.

01:00:03.132 --> 01:00:04.366
Have you ever been
to the O' Finn's Tavern

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:05.801
in Portland?

01:00:07.604 --> 01:00:09.638
Yeah. A while ago.

01:00:09.806 --> 01:00:11.673
Used to shoot pool there
and get some beers.

01:00:11.808 --> 01:00:14.743
Spend any time with a woman

01:00:14.911 --> 01:00:17.379
named Sissy Peyton?

01:00:19.315 --> 01:00:20.582
No.

01:00:20.683 --> 01:00:22.050
She was strangled
and tossed into a ravine,

01:00:22.151 --> 01:00:23.318
a happy face scrawled on her.

01:00:24.687 --> 01:00:25.854
I heard about that.

01:00:25.922 --> 01:00:27.356
Sissy was last seen
at O' Finn's Tavern.

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:28.323
Did you meet her?

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:30.092
No.

01:00:30.159 --> 01:00:31.259
You sure?

01:00:31.361 --> 01:00:32.194
Yeah, I'm sure.

01:00:32.295 --> 01:00:34.196
Wait...

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:36.932
Didn't I read
that some couple killed her?

01:00:38.001 --> 01:00:39.801
Have you ever been
to the Turlock,

01:00:39.969 --> 01:00:40.902
or Mount Ruskin,

01:00:41.070 --> 01:00:41.870
or Kennewick
truck stops?

01:00:42.005 --> 01:00:43.071
Yeah, all the time.

01:00:43.172 --> 01:00:44.206
They're right along
in my main route.

01:00:45.241 --> 01:00:46.742
Did you meet a Summer Northern?

01:00:48.378 --> 01:00:49.378
Or Taffy Billings?

01:00:49.545 --> 01:00:50.712
No.

01:00:50.847 --> 01:00:51.680
Do you recall

01:00:51.848 --> 01:00:53.882
meeting a woman named Candy?

01:00:54.017 --> 01:00:55.317
She had a baby.

01:00:55.451 --> 01:00:58.253
At the Mount Ruskin
truck stop?

01:00:58.421 --> 01:01:00.622
Candy claims that you tried
to sexually assault her,

01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:01.490
tried to kill her.

01:01:01.557 --> 01:01:03.959
So, that's what this is about?

01:01:04.093 --> 01:01:05.060
Look,

01:01:05.161 --> 01:01:06.328
I'm no angel,

01:01:06.429 --> 01:01:07.796
but Candy's
a working girl,

01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:08.997
and we got together.

01:01:09.032 --> 01:01:10.032
But that's it.

01:01:10.099 --> 01:01:12.401
If she wants to
press charges against me,

01:01:12.502 --> 01:01:14.036
do you think
anyone's gonna believe

01:01:14.137 --> 01:01:16.138
some lot lizard whore in court?

01:01:17.874 --> 01:01:19.608
Good luck.

01:01:29.852 --> 01:01:31.653
You recognize this?

01:01:34.757 --> 01:01:36.591
No.

01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:38.794
It's a letter
that you sent to me, Keith,

01:01:38.961 --> 01:01:40.629
signed by the Happy Face Killer.

01:01:41.898 --> 01:01:42.698
In it, it says,

01:01:42.865 --> 01:01:44.733
"maybe we'll meet
sometime."

01:01:44.867 --> 01:01:47.202
Here I am.

01:01:48.171 --> 01:01:50.138
Am I under arrest?

01:01:50.273 --> 01:01:53.108
Cause if not,
I've got to get back out there.

01:01:53.242 --> 01:01:54.342
Gotta make a living.

01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:57.279
No, you're not under arrest.

01:01:57.413 --> 01:01:59.514
Not yet.

01:02:01.851 --> 01:02:03.785
I didn't write that letter.

01:02:03.886 --> 01:02:05.654
I know you want to find
this killer

01:02:05.855 --> 01:02:08.256
and I'm sorry
I can't be more helpful.

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:14.096
It's been a pleasure.

01:02:58.174 --> 01:02:59.374
Just when I thought

01:02:59.542 --> 01:03:01.376
things were starting
to go my way,

01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:04.880
FBI special agent Melinda Gand

01:03:05.047 --> 01:03:07.516
had to come along
and ruin everything.

01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:12.187
I mean, the FBI did have to
send their best to get me,

01:03:12.321 --> 01:03:13.588
so I'm flattered,

01:03:13.656 --> 01:03:15.457
<i> but once she got involved
with the investigation,</i>

01:03:15.558 --> 01:03:16.725
<i> it made me nervous.</i>

01:03:16.793 --> 01:03:17.826
<i> She brought me in,</i>

01:03:17.927 --> 01:03:20.362
<i> made me think
she must be close, right?</i>

01:03:20.429 --> 01:03:23.732
<i> I hated
how she screwed with me.</i>

01:03:23.866 --> 01:03:27.869
<i> And it started to feel like
she was watching my every move.</i>

01:03:27.937 --> 01:03:32.174
<i> One more worthless,
uncaring bitch</i>

01:03:32.275 --> 01:03:34.009
<i> messing up my life.</i>

01:03:35.011 --> 01:03:36.278
<i> You gotta admit,</i>

01:03:36.445 --> 01:03:39.815
<i> it's pretty ironic that
they sent a woman after me.</i>

01:03:39.982 --> 01:03:43.518
<i> God has one messed-up
sense of humor.</i>

01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:51.226
Keith was always... sad,

01:03:51.294 --> 01:03:53.195
and lost.

01:03:53.262 --> 01:03:56.298
His childhood was
pretty much a nightmare.

01:03:56.332 --> 01:03:59.434
He said his father made him
torture animals.

01:03:59.535 --> 01:04:01.803
Electrocuted him even.

01:04:03.806 --> 01:04:04.840
The kids at school
tormented him.

01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:06.274
What was your marriage like?

01:04:06.409 --> 01:04:08.777
He was a caring father.

01:04:08.911 --> 01:04:11.746
Cora...

01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:13.748
Do you think
Keith could hurt women?

01:04:15.351 --> 01:04:16.585
He never touched
me or the kids.

01:04:17.887 --> 01:04:19.187
I mean, I know
he had affairs,

01:04:19.322 --> 01:04:21.223
but if you ask me,

01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:24.125
his problem with women
is that he likes them too much.

01:04:27.396 --> 01:04:29.264
I kind of like this one.

01:04:29.398 --> 01:04:31.933
My grandmother used to
have silverware like that.

01:04:32.001 --> 01:04:33.034
She gave it away.

01:04:35.071 --> 01:04:36.805
Do you like it?

01:04:36.906 --> 01:04:38.907
Keith?

01:04:38.975 --> 01:04:40.008
I like it
if you like it.

01:04:40.176 --> 01:04:42.811
I do.

01:04:48.017 --> 01:04:49.517
Now, this one
is my favorite.

01:04:49.685 --> 01:04:52.821
Silverware with
little tree limbs.

01:04:52.989 --> 01:04:55.724
Yeah, it's perfect...

01:04:55.892 --> 01:04:57.459
I like it.

01:04:59.595 --> 01:05:02.831
Good. Perfect.

01:05:02.999 --> 01:05:04.733
So, would you
consider Keith

01:05:04.867 --> 01:05:06.034
to be a violent person?

01:05:06.202 --> 01:05:09.704
It was just the way
that we were raised.

01:05:12.341 --> 01:05:13.341
My brother got the worst of it

01:05:13.476 --> 01:05:14.910
and probably took
a lot of it off of me.

01:05:15.044 --> 01:05:17.479
You were spared.

01:05:17.647 --> 01:05:19.114
Maybe, yeah.

01:05:19.248 --> 01:05:21.416
I talked to Cora.

01:05:21.517 --> 01:05:23.685
She told me about
your childhood.

01:05:23.853 --> 01:05:25.754
Sounded pretty rough.

01:05:26.956 --> 01:05:29.691
It was.

01:05:29.792 --> 01:05:32.227
With Keith, it wasn't just
about the abuse, though.

01:05:34.497 --> 01:05:36.831
He just always wanted to be
somebody else.

01:05:38.134 --> 01:05:40.468
He could never
control his emotions.

01:05:40.636 --> 01:05:43.271
I mean, the rage.

01:05:45.408 --> 01:05:47.842
I think he came
into the world like that.

01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:51.713
<i> Everybody thinks
they're special.</i>

01:05:51.814 --> 01:05:54.015
<i> Everyone thinks they're smart.</i>

01:05:54.083 --> 01:05:55.350
<i> But you're not.</i>

01:05:55.484 --> 01:05:58.486
You're either the wolf
or the sheep.

01:05:58.621 --> 01:06:00.121
All right, listen, listen,
hear me out,

01:06:00.289 --> 01:06:01.423
this is important.

01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:03.224
<i> As far as killing goes,
and getting away with it,</i>

01:06:03.326 --> 01:06:04.426
<i> here's the key.</i>

01:06:04.493 --> 01:06:05.927
<i> When you're trying
to dump a body,</i>

01:06:06.062 --> 01:06:08.129
<i> your real adversary
isn't the police,</i>

01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:09.197
<i> it's actually the public,</i>

01:06:09.365 --> 01:06:11.900
<i> so if you don't want
to get caught,</i>

01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:14.269
<i> make sure you have
no links to the victim,</i>

01:06:14.337 --> 01:06:18.006
<i> and then take their body
far, far away.</i>

01:06:18.174 --> 01:06:22.143
<i> Time and distance
is the main trick,</i>

01:06:22.311 --> 01:06:24.045
<i> and if you get that right,</i>

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:26.581
<i> well, abra-cadabra!</i>

01:06:49.772 --> 01:06:52.107
Dez...

01:06:52.208 --> 01:06:53.541
There's someone
here to see you.

01:06:53.609 --> 01:06:55.210
Mr. Whitman.

01:06:55.277 --> 01:06:56.344
Melinda Gand, FBI.

01:06:56.479 --> 01:06:57.779
Can we talk privately?

01:07:09.558 --> 01:07:10.358
Hey.

01:07:10.559 --> 01:07:11.726
<i> Dez, it's Keith.</i>

01:07:11.894 --> 01:07:13.128
<i> What's up?</i>

01:07:14.196 --> 01:07:15.030
Not much.

01:07:15.164 --> 01:07:16.031
How are you?

01:07:16.198 --> 01:07:17.132
I'm kinda busy here.

01:07:18.067 --> 01:07:19.601
Got any runs for me?

01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:20.635
Uh, let me take a look,

01:07:20.803 --> 01:07:22.637
and, I'll, uh,
call you right back.

01:07:22.772 --> 01:07:24.606
Dez, if you get any runs,
I could really use one now.

01:07:24.707 --> 01:07:25.573
All right?

01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:27.208
Gotta go.

01:07:48.564 --> 01:07:49.497
<i> "Police continue to investigate</i>

01:07:49.632 --> 01:07:51.922
<i> the brutal slayings of several young women..."</i>

01:07:52.523 --> 01:07:55.950
<i> "...left his signature happy face drawn
in blood on his victims at crime scenes."</i>

01:07:56.597 --> 01:07:58.023
<i> "Ongoing investigation..."</i>

01:07:58.103 --> 01:08:00.300
<i> "Criminal psychologists describe
him as someone who..."</i>

01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:51.960
You didn't
answer the phone.

01:08:52.127 --> 01:08:53.962
Diane, I...

01:08:54.063 --> 01:08:55.497
I just got busy.

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:57.265
That's...
that's all it is.

01:08:57.366 --> 01:09:00.401
It's not just that, honey.

01:09:00.536 --> 01:09:01.469
You say
you're going away

01:09:01.636 --> 01:09:02.770
for a certain
period of time

01:09:02.837 --> 01:09:05.305
and you don't come back
when you say you will.

01:09:05.508 --> 01:09:06.341
It's just,

01:09:06.442 --> 01:09:09.144
I have all these
wedding plans to make

01:09:09.245 --> 01:09:10.678
and decisions to make,

01:09:10.845 --> 01:09:12.981
and you're never around.

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:14.983
And you don't answer
your phone.

01:09:16.785 --> 01:09:17.986
You're right,
I'm sorry.

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:21.022
It's just, I'm forced to make
these decisions by myself,

01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:23.691
and it's
stressing me out.

01:09:23.759 --> 01:09:24.859
I need you
to be around.

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:25.960
And if you don't
answer your phone,

01:09:26.028 --> 01:09:27.428
how can I ask you
about anything?

01:09:27.496 --> 01:09:29.697
I said I'm sorry.

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:31.499
Okay?

01:09:31.634 --> 01:09:32.734
I just got busy.

01:09:32.902 --> 01:09:34.801
Yeah, you keep saying that.

01:09:36.538 --> 01:09:41.576
The dispatcher
tells me what to do.

01:09:41.676 --> 01:09:43.310
That's where I go.

01:09:43.412 --> 01:09:46.447
I'm just trying
to make a living.

01:09:51.053 --> 01:09:53.020
Yeah.

01:09:53.087 --> 01:09:54.722
I'm sorry.

01:09:55.658 --> 01:09:57.192
I'm sorry.

01:09:57.359 --> 01:09:58.860
You're right.

01:10:03.065 --> 01:10:04.199
I'm so sorry.

01:10:07.136 --> 01:10:10.238
Keith?

01:10:10.372 --> 01:10:12.273
What?

01:10:12.408 --> 01:10:13.875
What is it? Tell me?

01:10:17.379 --> 01:10:19.280
Why don't you ever
tell me anything?

01:10:19.348 --> 01:10:22.250
Don't be like that.

01:10:24.987 --> 01:10:26.621
Don't be like what?

01:10:30.326 --> 01:10:33.027
Let's start over.

01:10:33.195 --> 01:10:36.197
I'm starving.

01:10:36.298 --> 01:10:38.666
What's
in the fridge?

01:10:38.734 --> 01:10:41.302
Nothing!

01:10:48.911 --> 01:10:51.179
I think we should postpone
the wedding.

01:10:58.787 --> 01:11:01.889
<i> Why is it
that all women cause trouble?</i>

01:11:04.994 --> 01:11:08.830
You know what,
you don't want to see this.

01:11:35.457 --> 01:11:36.758
Just got a call.

01:11:36.859 --> 01:11:38.026
A woman named
Diane Loftin

01:11:38.193 --> 01:11:39.727
is missing from
her job at a diner.

01:11:39.862 --> 01:11:41.863
She's engaged
to Keith Jesperson.

01:13:34.576 --> 01:13:38.679
I'm sorry, Diane.

01:14:07.943 --> 01:14:11.045
Hey, Dez, it's Keith again.

01:14:11.146 --> 01:14:13.347
I just want you to know,
if there are any runs,

01:14:13.449 --> 01:14:14.515
I'm available.

01:14:14.616 --> 01:14:16.117
Here's the plan,

01:14:16.218 --> 01:14:17.151
when Jesperson calls
his dispatcher,

01:14:17.219 --> 01:14:18.453
he'll be directed
to a location.

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.321
Myself, Sheriff Cotton,
agent Anselo,

01:14:20.456 --> 01:14:21.756
and our team
will be there.

01:14:21.824 --> 01:14:22.890
Timing is key.

01:14:22.958 --> 01:14:25.193
Any questions?

01:14:27.930 --> 01:14:29.163
These women mattered.

01:14:30.165 --> 01:14:31.165
Let's bring him in.

01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:49.584
Hey, Dez.

01:14:49.718 --> 01:14:51.686
It's Keith.

01:14:51.787 --> 01:14:53.988
Is anybody looking for me?

01:14:54.122 --> 01:14:55.022
<i> What are you talking about?</i>

01:14:55.090 --> 01:14:56.257
Like who?

01:14:56.358 --> 01:14:57.124
You paranoid
or something?

01:14:57.226 --> 01:14:59.026
<i> What's your problem?</i>

01:14:59.061 --> 01:15:00.294
Nothing. Listen,

01:15:00.362 --> 01:15:02.330
I just really could use
a run right now.

01:15:04.132 --> 01:15:05.433
Find out where he is.

01:15:05.567 --> 01:15:06.767
Tell him to stay put,

01:15:06.902 --> 01:15:08.336
you'll call him with something.

01:15:08.437 --> 01:15:09.270
<i> Are you there, Dez?</i>

01:15:09.404 --> 01:15:10.905
<i> Dez?</i>

01:15:11.073 --> 01:15:12.173
Of course, I'm here.
where do I ever go?

01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:13.641
Stop messing with me!

01:15:13.809 --> 01:15:15.710
All right, hold tight,
and I'll get right back to you.

01:16:08.196 --> 01:16:09.764
Got it.

01:16:10.666 --> 01:16:12.033
Call him.

01:16:12.167 --> 01:16:14.101
Look, I know this is fun
and all, agent Gand,

01:16:14.169 --> 01:16:15.236
but I'm not gonna
get killed, am I?

01:16:15.304 --> 01:16:17.271
Call him and give him
this location.

01:16:28.450 --> 01:16:30.484
Hey, Dez...

01:16:30.619 --> 01:16:31.919
<i> You're in luck.</i>

01:16:32.087 --> 01:16:35.323
"Klingman Industrial Warehouse"
for pickup.

01:16:36.625 --> 01:16:38.960
What am I picking up?

01:16:40.796 --> 01:16:42.430
Uh, three tons
galvanized steel,

01:16:42.598 --> 01:16:43.464
six tons

01:16:43.632 --> 01:16:47.034
<i> of "I" beams.</i>

01:16:47.202 --> 01:16:48.603
<i> Keith...</i>

01:16:58.180 --> 01:16:59.347
<i> You want it or not, Keith?</i>

01:16:59.448 --> 01:17:02.183
Keith, you want it
or not?

01:17:03.819 --> 01:17:06.988
What's the address?

01:17:28.276 --> 01:17:30.378
<i> Hi, John.</i>

01:17:30.479 --> 01:17:32.913
<i> Well, it seems like
my luck has run out.</i>

01:17:33.048 --> 01:17:35.983
<i> I'll never be able
to enjoy life</i>

01:17:36.151 --> 01:17:37.318
<i> on the outside again.</i>

01:17:37.452 --> 01:17:40.755
<i> I got into a bad situation</i>

01:17:40.922 --> 01:17:42.490
<i> and my emotions
caught up with me.</i>

01:17:46.461 --> 01:17:47.928
<i> I killed a woman in my truck</i>

01:17:48.096 --> 01:17:49.597
<i> during an argument,</i>

01:17:49.731 --> 01:17:52.533
<i> and with all the evidence
against me,</i>

01:17:52.634 --> 01:17:54.869
<i> I guess I truly am
the black sheep of the family.</i>

01:17:56.638 --> 01:17:57.905
<i> The court will
appoint me a lawyer</i>

01:17:57.973 --> 01:17:59.807
<i> and there will be a trial</i>

01:17:59.908 --> 01:18:02.910
<i> and I'm sure they'll kill me
for this.</i>

01:18:03.011 --> 01:18:04.845
<i> Now...</i>

01:18:04.946 --> 01:18:08.349
<i> I'm sorry that things
turned out this way.</i>

01:18:09.951 --> 01:18:11.585
<i> I've been a killer
for some time.</i>

01:18:13.822 --> 01:18:16.724
<i> I've killed eight people,</i>

01:18:16.892 --> 01:18:18.559
<i> assaulted more.</i>

01:18:20.128 --> 01:18:21.295
<i> I guess I...</i>

01:18:21.463 --> 01:18:24.498
<i> haven't really
learned anything.</i>

01:19:28.463 --> 01:19:30.464
How you doing?

01:19:33.335 --> 01:19:34.401
Just leave
the rig here.

01:19:34.569 --> 01:19:36.871
We'll get the paperwork going.

01:19:54.356 --> 01:19:55.623
Freeze!

01:19:55.757 --> 01:19:56.891
Don't move!

01:20:04.699 --> 01:20:06.233
Hands behind
your head,

01:20:06.368 --> 01:20:07.668
Jesperson!

01:20:22.284 --> 01:20:23.717
You're under arrest

01:20:23.885 --> 01:20:25.653
for the murder of Diane Loftin.

01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:28.355
I didn't kill her.

01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:30.124
Yeah, you did.

01:20:32.127 --> 01:20:32.860
Just like you killed
Sissy Peyton

01:20:33.028 --> 01:20:34.128
and all the others.

01:20:34.229 --> 01:20:37.131
You can't prove that.

01:20:38.533 --> 01:20:42.369
I know you're
the Happy Face Killer.

01:20:45.841 --> 01:20:46.974
That's ridiculous.

01:20:47.108 --> 01:20:48.676
Get him out of here.

01:20:52.681 --> 01:20:56.150
I really am sorry that we didn't
have any time together... alone.

01:21:29.017 --> 01:21:31.051
Agent Gand?

01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:34.221
Something to remember us by.

01:21:37.692 --> 01:21:39.727
That's a big honor.

01:21:39.828 --> 01:21:42.096
She guards those
with her life.

01:21:46.167 --> 01:21:47.701
Thank you.

01:21:49.037 --> 01:21:51.906
Thanks, Felicia.

01:22:43.325 --> 01:22:44.458
You know what?

01:22:44.592 --> 01:22:46.293
I would've made
a hell of a Mountie.

01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:51.398
But, well, their loss.

01:22:51.566 --> 01:22:53.400
Come on, let's go.
