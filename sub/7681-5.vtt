01:13.166 --> 01:15.657
Cessna Zero-Five-Charlie,
cleared for touch and go.

01:15.667 --> 01:17.658
Wind at one yero
from the northeast.

01:17.667 --> 01:20.158
Roger, Lincoln Tower,
Zero-Five-Charlie.

01:20.166 --> 01:22.657
Piper Three-Six-Echo,
taxi to runway two six left

01:22.667 --> 01:24.703
and hold short
for outbound traffic.

01:25.166 --> 01:26.155
Three-Six-Echo.

01:26.166 --> 01:29.158
Cessna Two-Five-Bravo,
clear for takeoff.

01:29.166 --> 01:31.703
Lincoln Tower,
Bonanya Four-Eight-Zulu...

01:31.709 --> 01:33.165
request permission
to enter pattern.

01:33.166 --> 01:34.702
Four-Eight-Zulu,
request approved.

01:34.709 --> 01:36.700
Follow Cessna
Three-Eight-Charlie.

01:36.709 --> 01:38.700
Roger. Four-Eight-Zulu
following Cessna.

01:39.166 --> 01:42.158
Flying a small plane
can be fun.

01:42.166 --> 01:44.703
It can also be
kind of frightening.

01:44.709 --> 01:47.701
Now, I've always felt
the best way to confront a fear

01:47.709 --> 01:49.199
of the ocean
is to dive right in.

01:51.709 --> 01:52.698
So it seemed
like the smart way

01:52.709 --> 01:55.701
to deal with the fear
of flying light planes

01:55.709 --> 01:58.200
was to take the train or a bus.

01:58.208 --> 02:00.699
Now, it's possible
the carburetor froye up

02:00.709 --> 02:02.700
in this ice storm
I was flying through,

02:02.709 --> 02:04.745
but that didn't explain
why I wasn't getting

02:05.208 --> 02:07.199
a decent throttle response.

02:07.208 --> 02:09.745
Nor was there any indication
as to why the controls felt

02:09.750 --> 02:12.742
like they were stuck in cement.

02:13.208 --> 02:16.200
It did not look good
for the home team.

02:23.750 --> 02:26.241
I'm sorry, but you have crashed.

02:27.750 --> 02:28.739
Hey, Mac!

02:28.750 --> 02:30.240
You got a minute?

02:36.250 --> 02:38.241
What's the matter, Mac?

02:38.250 --> 02:40.741
Little simulator get to you?

02:40.750 --> 02:43.241
I'd rather fly a T-38 any day.

02:43.250 --> 02:45.241
Well, I have a
small confession.

02:45.250 --> 02:47.241
I had them rig it
so you'd crash.

02:47.792 --> 02:49.783
Worse possible weather,

02:49.792 --> 02:52.249
total engine malfunction,
froyen controls.

02:52.250 --> 02:52.784
You never had a chance.

02:54.792 --> 02:55.781
It was just a little joke.

02:57.792 --> 02:59.783
Besides, it builds character.

02:59.792 --> 03:01.783
I mean, the worst thing
happened, and you survived.

03:01.792 --> 03:04.784
I remember things
like this, Thornton.

03:04.792 --> 03:06.282
Oh, come on, Mac, relax.

03:06.792 --> 03:09.283
All of this would never happen
in a real plane.

03:09.291 --> 03:12.283
Why do I feel
all this has a point?

03:12.291 --> 03:13.781
I don't...

03:13.792 --> 03:15.783
You want me
to fly a plane

03:15.792 --> 03:16.781
just like that
, don't you?

03:16.792 --> 03:17.781
No, absolutely not!

03:18.291 --> 03:19.781
I would never ask you
to do that.

03:20.291 --> 03:21.781
You only have to ride in one.

03:23.291 --> 03:25.282
Mac, you remember
that pilot program

03:25.291 --> 03:27.828
Phoenix set up with
the National Youth Authority?

03:27.834 --> 03:30.280
The one based
on our gang violence research?

03:30.291 --> 03:32.828
Oh, yeah, the street
kids sort of roughing it

03:33.291 --> 03:34.280
out in the wilderness.

03:34.291 --> 03:35.827
Yeah, that's right,
as a part of their probation.

03:36.291 --> 03:37.827
Well, it's finally happening.

03:37.834 --> 03:38.823
Oh, good. How's it going?

03:38.834 --> 03:40.825
Put it out, Ramon.

03:40.834 --> 03:42.825
Look, take a chill pill, Cavanaugh.

03:42.834 --> 03:45.325
It isn't like I'm smoking crack
or nothing, all right?

03:45.333 --> 03:47.324
We're in a fire area...

03:47.333 --> 03:49.324
but I guess
you didn't read the sign.

03:49.333 --> 03:50.823
I read it.

03:51.333 --> 03:52.823
The problem is they've got a
social scientist

03:53.333 --> 03:54.322
heading the field test...

03:54.834 --> 03:57.325
a guy with a doctor's degree
but no street savvy.

03:57.333 --> 03:59.824
The powers-that-be insisted.
It was out of my hands.

04:00.333 --> 04:02.824
As I recall,
I really wanted that job.

04:02.834 --> 04:04.870
Yeah, I know. Guess what?

04:04.875 --> 04:07.867
No, are you serious?

04:07.875 --> 04:08.864
When do I leave?

04:08.875 --> 04:09.864
Tomorrow.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.866
But there's, uh,
one other small thing.

04:11.875 --> 04:13.866
Uh, we've really extended
the funds on this,

04:14.333 --> 04:15.869
so there's
very little money involved.

04:15.875 --> 04:16.863
I mean, like, none.

04:16.875 --> 04:17.863
Pete, when has that
ever stopped me?

04:18.333 --> 04:20.324
I'm dying to do this.
You know that.

04:20.333 --> 04:22.870
Great. Listen, I'll
even throw in the old bonus.

04:22.875 --> 04:23.864
No, don't bother.

04:23.875 --> 04:25.365
No, I want to.

04:25.375 --> 04:26.364
Whatever you want,
you just name it.

04:26.875 --> 04:28.365
I mean anything.

04:28.375 --> 04:30.366
The Colorado River Kayak Race.

04:30.375 --> 04:32.366
You and me shooting the rapids.

04:32.375 --> 04:34.866
That's the bonus I want.

04:34.875 --> 04:35.864
Yeah.

04:35.875 --> 04:37.866
Yeah, I like that.

04:43.375 --> 04:45.366
I'm not asking you
a second time.

04:45.375 --> 04:47.912
Good.

04:50.375 --> 04:53.913
Stay out of it, Luther.

04:53.917 --> 04:56.909
The man said no smoking.

05:02.917 --> 05:03.906
Stop it!

05:10.917 --> 05:11.906
Come on!

05:11.917 --> 05:13.908
Break it up! Break it up!
Break it up!

05:16.417 --> 05:17.907
That's it!

05:18.417 --> 05:19.406
You're all going back

05:19.917 --> 05:20.906
to four walls
when this is over!

05:21.417 --> 05:23.408
You blew it!

05:24.417 --> 05:25.953
You're going to need eyes

05:25.959 --> 05:27.415
in the back of your head.

05:27.417 --> 05:29.408
Yeah, right.

05:34.417 --> 05:36.954
You sure you got
enough runway, there?

05:36.959 --> 05:38.950
Relax, MacGyver.

05:38.959 --> 05:40.950
I've made this landing
doyens of times.

05:40.959 --> 05:42.950
Believe me, you're safer up here

05:43.417 --> 05:43.951
than you're going to be down there

05:44.458 --> 05:45.447
with those cutthroats.

05:45.959 --> 05:48.450
Boy, they tought to
put them all away... permanently.

05:48.458 --> 05:49.447
You know these kids?

05:49.959 --> 05:52.450
I had to fly them up here.

05:52.959 --> 05:55.951
You're really walking into
a hornet's nest.

06:04.458 --> 06:06.995
That's it! I can't eat
this yoid food.

06:07.001 --> 06:09.993
Fine. Starve. It's your choice.

06:10.001 --> 06:11.992
Listen, dipstick,
this was not my choice!

06:12.458 --> 06:13.994
This whole thing is lame!
You know what?

06:14.001 --> 06:15.457
Find yourself
another guinea pig.

06:21.001 --> 06:23.447
Whoa! What's
that smell?

06:23.458 --> 06:27.997
It's like chocolate cake...
or brownies.

06:28.001 --> 06:29.992
Come on,
let's check it out.

06:32.001 --> 06:33.491
I wonder who's making it.

06:33.500 --> 06:36.492
Who cares?
I just want to eat it.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.992
First impressions
are very important,

06:50.000 --> 06:52.491
and with this group,
I knew it'd be critical,

06:52.500 --> 06:55.492
so I decided to make
a grand entrance...

06:55.500 --> 06:57.491
through their noses.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.491
There it is.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.991
Someone's cooking
down there.

07:12.542 --> 07:14.999
Brownies, anyone?

07:15.000 --> 07:17.537
I'll take that as a yes.

07:21.542 --> 07:22.531
Who are you?

07:22.542 --> 07:24.032
Yeah.

07:24.041 --> 07:26.032
Who are you?

07:26.041 --> 07:29.033
Name's MacGyver.
Pete Thornton sent me.

07:29.041 --> 07:31.532
He's "the man"
in the fancy disguise.

07:31.542 --> 07:33.533
Cavanaughnumero dos.

07:33.542 --> 07:35.032
Hasta luego, ese.

07:35.041 --> 07:38.033
We don't buy.

07:38.041 --> 07:40.532
He sent you to bail me out,
didn't he?

07:40.542 --> 07:42.533
Well, I think of it
more as a collaboration.

07:42.542 --> 07:44.032
Hey, you want
to run this show?!

07:44.041 --> 07:46.032
Fine! You don't need me.

07:46.041 --> 07:48.032
I'll send the pilot
back for you on Friday.

07:48.583 --> 07:49.572
Hey, Tom, I'm here to help.

07:49.583 --> 07:51.574
Who said I needed any, huh?

07:51.583 --> 07:54.575
Obviously, Thornton thinks
that you can do a better job.

07:54.583 --> 07:57.040
No, I think he thought
we'd work together on it.

07:57.041 --> 07:59.032
Yeah, right.

07:59.583 --> 08:01.574
Keep baking those brownies,
MacGyver.

08:02.041 --> 08:03.577
See how far it gets you.

08:35.625 --> 08:37.616
You make a nice fire, MacGyver.

08:39.082 --> 08:41.073
Looks like your
girlfriend wants

08:41.082 --> 08:44.621
to cruise with
Mr. Wonder Bread.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.115
How's it going, Gina?

08:46.125 --> 08:48.116
Okay.

08:48.125 --> 08:49.615
Even better since you got here.

08:50.125 --> 08:51.615
She's not my girl.

08:52.125 --> 08:53.615
Not anymore.

08:53.625 --> 08:55.616
So, what's on your mind?

08:55.625 --> 08:57.115
Really want to know?

08:57.125 --> 08:58.615
Mm-hmm.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.115
Wood.

09:00.125 --> 09:02.116
Fire's getting low.

09:10.667 --> 09:12.123
That's okay.

09:12.125 --> 09:14.116
I like a challenge.

09:14.125 --> 09:15.661
That's why I'm in a gang.

09:16.125 --> 09:17.661
Yeah? Is that
the only reason?

09:18.125 --> 09:19.114
It's just the way it is.

09:19.125 --> 09:21.662
I was born into it
just like my sister was.

09:22.125 --> 09:23.661
Is your sister
still running with a gang?

09:23.667 --> 09:25.658
Let's just say she's
on a long vacation...

09:25.667 --> 09:27.658
about five years,

09:27.667 --> 09:29.658
maybe less with good behavior.

09:41.667 --> 09:43.658
Time to die, ese.

09:43.667 --> 09:46.158
All right, can it!

09:46.709 --> 09:49.155
You two want to fight,
you put on gloves,

09:49.166 --> 09:50.702
but it doesn't happen here!

09:50.709 --> 09:52.165
What a tough guy!

09:52.709 --> 09:53.698
What are you going to do next,
spank us?

09:53.709 --> 09:54.698
No, actually, you'd like that,

09:54.709 --> 09:56.165
wouldn't you, Gina?

09:56.709 --> 09:57.698
Why don't you shut up,
you idiot?

09:57.709 --> 10:00.701
Time out!

10:03.166 --> 10:06.203
Oh, it's going to
be a long two days.

10:09.208 --> 10:10.698
And, boy, was it.

10:10.709 --> 10:12.199
Felt like two weeks.

10:12.709 --> 10:14.700
Dealing with these kids
was a little like putting out

10:15.208 --> 10:16.197
a forest fire.

10:16.208 --> 10:17.197
You'd think you had it
under control,

10:17.709 --> 10:20.200
and then another spark
would set it off again.

10:20.208 --> 10:22.699
I can't help feeling
that more time alone with them

10:22.709 --> 10:24.199
might've made a difference.

10:25.208 --> 10:28.200
Hey, Mr. Pilot,
you gonna let me fly

10:28.208 --> 10:29.744
the plane this time, huh?

10:29.750 --> 10:31.741
Come on...
Sit back in your seat, punk!

10:31.750 --> 10:33.741
I won't put up
with this again.

10:33.750 --> 10:35.741
Just fly the plane, Carl.

10:39.208 --> 10:42.746
Try to just enjoy the scenery
outside the window, huh?

10:46.250 --> 10:47.740
Sit down! Now!

10:47.750 --> 10:49.741
No, my man.

10:49.750 --> 10:52.742
The no smoking and seat belt
signs are turned off, no?

10:52.750 --> 10:54.741
Come on...

10:54.750 --> 10:56.240
Stop it, stop it this second!

10:56.250 --> 10:58.741
Sit back down in that seat
and put your seat belt back on!

11:03.250 --> 11:04.786
What's wrong?

11:04.792 --> 11:06.248
What's happening?

11:06.792 --> 11:07.781
Hey, man, what's
with the pilot?!

11:09.792 --> 11:10.781
Do something!

11:10.792 --> 11:11.781
Do something!

11:11.792 --> 11:12.247
Come on!

11:17.792 --> 11:18.247
What's wrong?

11:19.792 --> 11:20.781
Come on!

11:25.792 --> 11:27.282
Are we going to crash?!

11:27.792 --> 11:28.281
Hey, no, man, no!

11:29.792 --> 11:31.282
Hey, get it up,
get it up!

11:34.792 --> 11:37.283
Don't hit it, man!

11:45.291 --> 11:46.280
Hey, what's
happening, man?

11:47.834 --> 11:50.280
Come on!

11:50.291 --> 11:52.828
Come on, MacGyver, do something!

11:55.291 --> 11:56.827
Hey, man, are we gonna crash?

11:57.834 --> 11:58.823
Come on, man!

12:03.834 --> 12:06.325
Look out for the trees!

12:18.834 --> 12:20.825
Hang on, everybody!

12:50.875 --> 12:51.864
We're on fire!

12:51.875 --> 12:52.864
The radio's burning.

12:58.875 --> 13:00.365
Everybody all right?

13:00.375 --> 13:01.364
You okay?

13:01.875 --> 13:03.365
Guys? Yeah.

13:03.375 --> 13:04.911
Ramon?

13:04.917 --> 13:05.917
Nothing wrong with me, man.

13:05.917 --> 13:06.372
Hands off.

13:08.917 --> 13:09.906
What happened to him?

13:10.375 --> 13:10.909
I don't know.

13:15.375 --> 13:17.912
I think he had a coronary...
a heart attack.

13:17.917 --> 13:18.906
Is he dead?

13:18.917 --> 13:20.908
Yeah.

13:20.917 --> 13:22.373
Let me outta here.

13:22.375 --> 13:23.364
Let me out!

13:23.375 --> 13:24.410
Oh!

13:35.917 --> 13:37.407
Nitroglycerin.

13:40.917 --> 13:42.407
This is your fault, sucker.

13:42.917 --> 13:43.906
Like always.

13:43.917 --> 13:46.408
Oh, you just had to be so damn

13:46.417 --> 13:48.954
cool, Ramon,
freak out the pilot.

13:48.959 --> 13:50.415
You're history, pal.

13:50.417 --> 13:54.410
Hey! You guys wann
a just shut it down?

13:54.417 --> 13:56.954
The pilot had a
serious heart condition.

13:56.959 --> 13:58.950
He shouldn't have been
flying in the first place.

13:58.959 --> 14:01.416
That doesn't excuse the
fact of what went down.

14:01.417 --> 14:02.953
Now he put us here

14:02.959 --> 14:04.449
and he's gonna pay the price...

14:04.959 --> 14:06.449
like he should've
done a long time ago.

14:08.458 --> 14:10.449
Somebody wanna fill me in?

14:10.458 --> 14:11.948
Nothing to fill in.

14:11.959 --> 14:13.449
The man's got a problem.

14:13.959 --> 14:15.449
We've all got problems.

14:15.458 --> 14:16.948
That's life, Whitebread.

14:36.001 --> 14:36.456
So what now?

14:37.001 --> 14:38.992
How are we gonna
get outta here, man?

14:39.001 --> 14:43.449
Well, first we're going to try
and find some food and shelter.

14:43.458 --> 14:46.996
And then hope a search party
starts looking for us.

14:47.001 --> 14:49.492
That aren't good enough, man.

14:49.500 --> 14:50.990
I got places to be.

14:51.500 --> 14:52.489
Yeah, see, MacGyver?

14:52.500 --> 14:54.491
It aren't safe
for him out here.

14:54.500 --> 14:55.990
He needs his gang.

14:56.001 --> 15:00.495
I lead my gang... because I
earned their respect...

15:00.500 --> 15:01.990
the hard way.

15:04.001 --> 15:06.492
Doggone it! Guys!

15:06.500 --> 15:11.494
Why don't you save
your energy, huh?

15:11.500 --> 15:13.991
Look, it's going to get
cold out here tonight,

15:14.000 --> 15:15.991
real cold.

15:16.500 --> 15:17.990
What do you say we pitch a tent?

15:20.500 --> 15:22.991
Parachute into a tent.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.991
Pretty slick, MacGyver.
I like it.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.537
Oh, Gina, please
spare us your sap.

15:27.542 --> 15:28.998
He hasn't saved us yet.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.991
I don't see you coming up
with any ideas, scum wad.

15:31.000 --> 15:31.989
Shut up!

15:34.542 --> 15:37.534
They used to be a thing.

15:37.542 --> 15:40.534
Aren't love blind, mam?

15:40.542 --> 15:43.989
Not if you give it
a chance... man.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.538
Hey, Luther.

15:47.542 --> 15:50.033
What do you say
we earn our dinner?

15:52.542 --> 15:55.033
Have you ever had
fresh mountain trout

15:55.542 --> 15:58.033
with wild mushrooms
and pine nuts?

15:58.542 --> 16:00.032
Outrageous.

16:32.083 --> 16:34.574
We both know nothing's
going to happen, Gina,

16:34.583 --> 16:36.073
so why don't we cut the act?

16:36.583 --> 16:38.073
Whoa, come here.

16:38.083 --> 16:40.574
Wanna level with me?

16:40.583 --> 16:43.074
All this has to do
with someone else, doesn't it?

16:43.083 --> 16:44.619
He made a choice.

16:44.625 --> 16:46.616
Tommy's gang won, and I lost.

16:46.625 --> 16:47.614
He couldn't have both.

16:47.625 --> 16:48.614
Why not?

16:48.625 --> 16:49.614
It just doesn't work

16:49.625 --> 16:50.614
that way, MacGyver.

16:50.625 --> 16:51.614
We're enemies.

16:52.083 --> 16:53.072
I don't wanna talk
about it anymore.

16:53.625 --> 16:54.614
Okay.

16:56.625 --> 16:57.614
Wanna fill me in

16:58.083 --> 17:01.075
on what's goin' down
between Ramon and Luther?

17:01.083 --> 17:02.619
Find someone else
to be your squeak.

17:03.083 --> 17:04.618
I'm sick and tired
of being used.

17:04.625 --> 17:05.614
Hey!

17:07.625 --> 17:09.616
Do you really think
that's what I'm doing?

17:09.625 --> 17:10.614
Really?

17:20.125 --> 17:23.117
Ramon wasted Luther's little
brother about a year ago.

17:23.625 --> 17:24.660
The kid was all he had

17:24.666 --> 17:27.124
unless you wanna count
his drunk mother.

17:27.666 --> 17:30.124
It messed him up pretty bad.

17:30.125 --> 17:31.661
Why didn't Ramon go to jail?

17:32.125 --> 17:34.662
'Cause there weren't
any eyewitnesses, bud.

17:34.667 --> 17:35.656
Don't you get it?

17:36.125 --> 17:37.661
But everybody
knows he did it.

17:37.667 --> 17:39.658
How do you think he got
to become El Pachuco,

17:40.125 --> 17:41.114
leader of his gang, huh?

17:47.667 --> 17:48.656
Beats the brownies, man.

17:49.166 --> 17:50.656
Look, who cares about food?

17:50.667 --> 17:53.659
What's this guy doing
to get us rescued? Nothing!

17:54.166 --> 17:55.155
And what're you doing, Tommy?

17:55.166 --> 17:56.656
Let's hear some of your ideas.

17:56.667 --> 17:57.656
Take it easy, Gina.

17:57.667 --> 18:00.158
Hey, don't ever stand up
for me, okay!

18:00.166 --> 18:02.657
I don't need it,
and I don't want it!

18:02.667 --> 18:03.156
You got that?

18:21.709 --> 18:23.165
You okay?

18:23.166 --> 18:26.704
Yeah, man, never felt better.

18:26.709 --> 18:27.698
Glad to hear it.

18:36.709 --> 18:38.199
Nobody move!

18:57.208 --> 18:58.197
Freeye, Luther.

19:01.208 --> 19:03.745
Don't move a muscle.

19:09.250 --> 19:11.241
Everyone stay froyen.

19:14.250 --> 19:14.739
I'll be right back.

19:15.250 --> 19:16.239
What the hell you doing, man?

19:16.250 --> 19:17.239
Where're you going?

19:50.792 --> 19:52.282
What the hell are you doing, man?

19:52.792 --> 19:55.283
Snake crawled in for warmth.

19:55.792 --> 19:57.783
That's why it's going to crawl out.

20:49.875 --> 20:51.866
Well, that takes care
of finding lunch.

20:51.875 --> 20:53.331
Ooh.

20:53.333 --> 20:55.324
Come on, Tommy, time to wake up.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.867
All right, folks.
I got a choice to make.

21:18.875 --> 21:21.366
Either I trust you all
and I go look for him,

21:21.375 --> 21:22.865
or I stay here.

21:22.875 --> 21:25.366
I want your word that nothing
will happen while I'm gone.

21:25.917 --> 21:27.373
Hey, don't be looking
at me, man.

21:27.917 --> 21:28.372
Look at him.

21:30.375 --> 21:32.366
I'm looking at both of ya.

21:37.917 --> 21:40.909
All right.
Nothing'll happen.

21:44.375 --> 21:46.411
You gonna believe
what he tells ya?

21:46.417 --> 21:47.406
That's right.

22:34.959 --> 22:35.948
Tommy?

23:02.001 --> 23:03.457
MacGyver!

23:18.083 --> 23:21.575
All right, hold still.

23:21.583 --> 23:23.073
She's just protecting her food.

23:25.083 --> 23:26.072
Don't look her in the eye.

23:39.083 --> 23:40.619
There's a time
to be Daniel Boone

23:41.083 --> 23:43.074
and a time to be a plumber.

23:43.083 --> 23:45.620
This one called for the latter.

24:00.625 --> 24:02.115
I knew that mountain lion

24:02.125 --> 24:05.117
wouldn't leave its meal behind
for just any old thing...

24:05.125 --> 24:08.117
except maybe a cold shower.

24:45.166 --> 24:46.702
You bet.

24:48.166 --> 24:49.702
Hey, listen,
I'm sorry about that.

24:50.166 --> 24:52.157
I know you coulda
handled that on your own,

24:52.166 --> 24:54.157
but I wanted to test a theory
and, uh...

24:54.166 --> 24:56.703
No hard feelings?

24:56.709 --> 24:58.165
No.

24:58.166 --> 25:00.157
All right, let's go.

25:10.709 --> 25:12.199
You all right?

25:13.709 --> 25:16.200
Why'd you come out here, Tommy?

25:16.208 --> 25:17.197
I want the truth.

25:19.208 --> 25:21.199
Ready for this?

25:21.208 --> 25:24.200
I was gonna get us all rescued...

25:24.208 --> 25:25.744
be a big hero.

25:25.750 --> 25:27.741
I'm an idiot sometimes.

25:27.750 --> 25:29.206
No, that took guts.

25:29.208 --> 25:30.744
I even think

25:30.750 --> 25:32.206
Gina'd appreciate that.

25:32.750 --> 25:36.197
Maybe once...
before she joined her gang.

25:36.208 --> 25:38.199
Before you joined yours.

25:38.208 --> 25:39.744
The gang was all that I had

25:40.208 --> 25:42.199
Better than getting
beat up by the old man.

25:42.208 --> 25:45.245
It's too bad you let the gangs
get in your way.

26:08.792 --> 26:10.248
Where is he?

26:10.250 --> 26:11.239
I don't know.

26:14.250 --> 26:15.239
I wouldn't do it, Luther.

26:15.792 --> 26:16.781
Don't be getting into this, girl.

26:16.792 --> 26:17.781
It aren't your business.

27:06.834 --> 27:08.324
Where'd you find him?

27:08.333 --> 27:10.824
Having lunch
with a mountain lion.

27:10.834 --> 27:12.825
It's a long story.

27:15.333 --> 27:17.324
Where's Luther and Ramon?

27:17.333 --> 27:19.824
They're around somewhere.

27:19.834 --> 27:22.325
Yeah?
How long they been gone?

27:22.333 --> 27:24.324
A while.

27:26.875 --> 27:29.332
What's the matter, Gina?

27:29.333 --> 27:30.869
Tell me.

27:30.875 --> 27:32.331
Luther's going after him.

28:02.875 --> 28:05.366
Time to make it even, ese.

28:06.917 --> 28:08.373
Don't do it, Luther!

28:08.375 --> 28:09.911
He killed my brother!

28:09.917 --> 28:11.373
What do you think'll
happen to you?

28:11.375 --> 28:12.364
I don't care, man.

28:12.375 --> 28:13.911
You do care!

28:13.917 --> 28:14.906
You're too smart not to.

28:39.917 --> 28:41.407
Where you feel it?

28:41.417 --> 28:43.408
My chest.

28:43.417 --> 28:44.907
For how long?

28:44.917 --> 28:48.409
Since the crash.

28:56.959 --> 28:59.416
I warned you
to stay out of this.

28:59.417 --> 29:01.408
Hey, hey, she didn't tell him
nothin', Luther.

29:01.959 --> 29:03.415
MacGyver figured it out
on his own.

29:03.417 --> 29:06.454
Look, you don't wanna be
jiving me, sucker.

29:06.458 --> 29:08.949
I'm not.

29:33.458 --> 29:35.995
I don't need
nobody's help, man.

29:36.001 --> 29:38.993
Humor me, okay?

29:46.001 --> 29:47.992
What's his problem?

29:48.001 --> 29:49.992
He's got all the symptoms
of internal injuries,

29:50.500 --> 29:51.000
and if that's true...

29:51.500 --> 29:52.990
What?

29:53.001 --> 29:56.493
We don't have time to wait
for a search party.

29:56.500 --> 29:58.491
Listen, underneath the dash
in the plane,

29:58.500 --> 30:00.491
there's a whole bunch
of rubber tubing.

30:00.500 --> 30:01.990
It's connected
to the oil pressure gauge.

30:02.001 --> 30:03.491
Bring me a couple
of two-foot lengths.

30:03.500 --> 30:04.489
And grab the radio headset, too.

30:05.001 --> 30:05.490
Okay.

30:10.500 --> 30:12.491
I really hope
he's gonna be okay.

30:12.500 --> 30:13.990
Yeah.

30:23.500 --> 30:24.990
Thanks.

30:25.542 --> 30:26.531
For what?

30:26.542 --> 30:27.998
You know... Luther.

30:28.000 --> 30:28.989
It was no strain.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.991
MacGyver told me
the reason you left

30:31.000 --> 30:32.536
was to get us all saved.

30:32.542 --> 30:34.999
MacGyver says a lot of stuff.

30:37.542 --> 30:39.533
Yeah, I know, but I think
this one was true.

30:46.041 --> 30:48.532
Uh, Gina?

30:49.041 --> 30:54.035
Look, maybe we could try
to be friends again.

30:54.041 --> 30:57.533
Yeah, I'd like that.

31:06.041 --> 31:07.577
Did you kill Luther's brother?

31:08.041 --> 31:10.578
Maybe I did.
Maybe I didn't.

31:13.041 --> 31:14.577
I think you didn't.

31:20.041 --> 31:21.577
What's all this jayy for?

31:21.583 --> 31:24.575
I'm gonna make
a little homemade stethoscope.

31:24.583 --> 31:27.074
It'll help pinpoint the damage.

31:45.083 --> 31:46.619
I don't like it.

31:46.625 --> 31:49.082
They were due back
yesterday afternoon.

31:49.083 --> 31:51.074
This just isn't like Mac.

31:51.083 --> 31:53.620
We'll start with a broad sweep
of the northwest sector

31:53.625 --> 31:55.081
and then go from there.

31:55.083 --> 31:57.074
This is Control Center
to Chopper Unit 44.

32:17.125 --> 32:19.616
His bowel sounds are almost gone.

32:19.625 --> 32:21.616
I think he's got
a punctured spleen.

32:27.125 --> 32:28.661
What do you think?

32:29.125 --> 32:30.114
I think Ramon's going to die

32:30.125 --> 32:31.661
if we don't get him
to a hospital fast.

32:32.125 --> 32:32.659
Justice!

32:33.125 --> 32:34.114
Not in my book.

32:34.125 --> 32:35.661
We're going to get him
out of here.

32:35.667 --> 32:36.656
How?

32:37.125 --> 32:37.659
In that.

32:39.125 --> 32:40.661
What?

32:43.125 --> 32:44.661
You've gotta be kidding.

32:56.166 --> 32:59.158
We're gonna need
a hollowed out log

32:59.166 --> 33:02.158
about three foot long
and smooth on the bottom.

33:05.709 --> 33:09.156
The lighter the load the better.

33:09.166 --> 33:11.703
And hopefully a head wind to
counteract the front-end weight.

33:11.709 --> 33:13.700
What're you saying, MacGyver?

33:13.709 --> 33:15.165
We're gonna build ourselves
a front ski

33:15.166 --> 33:16.155
where that tire used to be.

33:16.709 --> 33:17.698
Sorta like a snow plane.

33:17.709 --> 33:19.165
Can't wait to see
how you're gonna make snow.

33:19.709 --> 33:20.164
We're not.

33:20.709 --> 33:21.698
We're gonna make mud.

33:21.709 --> 33:23.165
But it's going to take

33:23.166 --> 33:25.157
all of us to pull this one off.

33:25.166 --> 33:27.202
Yeah?
Well, you can count me out.

33:27.208 --> 33:28.698
Uh-huh.

33:29.208 --> 33:30.197
Listen, why don't you
start clearing

33:30.208 --> 33:31.197
all the brush and rocks.

33:31.208 --> 33:32.197
Got it.

33:32.709 --> 33:33.698
Gina, find me some branches
about six-foot long

33:34.208 --> 33:34.708
and as straight as possible.

33:35.208 --> 33:35.708
Okay.

34:09.250 --> 34:10.739
How are these?

34:10.750 --> 34:12.239
Perfect.

34:12.250 --> 34:14.741
I got the field as clean
as I could get it.

34:14.750 --> 34:15.739
Good job.

34:15.750 --> 34:17.239
Can I borrow your earrings?

34:17.250 --> 34:18.739
Earrings, huh?

34:19.250 --> 34:19.739
Yeah.

34:23.750 --> 34:25.239
Are you building one of those
things that surveyors use?

34:25.250 --> 34:27.241
It's called a theodolite.

34:27.792 --> 34:28.246
A what?

34:28.792 --> 34:29.246
It's a sighting tool.

34:29.792 --> 34:31.248
I have a friend
that works in the city

34:31.250 --> 34:32.786
uses something like this.
You know how to work one?

34:32.792 --> 34:34.783
Yeah, I could figure it out.

34:34.792 --> 34:36.248
This is primitive, though.

34:36.250 --> 34:37.239
It's caveman time.

34:37.250 --> 34:39.786
More like George Washington's
time.

34:39.792 --> 34:41.783
Okay, look,
here's my compass.

34:41.792 --> 34:45.784
Think you can give me 300 yards
due west, straight as an arrow?

34:45.792 --> 34:47.783
Uh, sure, if you
give me some help.

34:48.291 --> 34:49.781
All right, here's
your first lesson.

34:49.792 --> 34:52.283
The average walking pace
is about one yard.

34:52.291 --> 34:54.782
Oh, so then, uh, 300 paces
and we got it?

34:55.291 --> 34:56.280
You got it.

34:56.291 --> 34:57.280
You heard the man...

34:57.291 --> 34:58.280
300 paces
across the meadow.

34:58.291 --> 34:59.280
Hurry up.

34:59.291 --> 35:00.280
I'll sight you up.
Go.

35:00.792 --> 35:01.781
AYe, aye, Captain.

35:01.792 --> 35:02.781
Relax.

35:02.792 --> 35:04.282
One, two, three,

35:04.291 --> 35:06.282
four, five, six,

35:06.291 --> 35:10.284
seven, eight, nine
, ten, 11, 12...

35:14.834 --> 35:17.826
What's taking the rescue
party so long, man?

35:17.834 --> 35:21.827
I'm getting bored
laying around here.

35:21.834 --> 35:24.280
We can't wait
for a rescue party.

35:27.333 --> 35:29.324
How do you feel
about another plane ride?

35:29.333 --> 35:31.824
What do I got to lose?

35:39.834 --> 35:42.325
You know, you're a fool
trying to save him.

35:44.834 --> 35:48.873
You know, you think you got
everybody pegged, don't ya?

35:48.875 --> 35:50.331
Well, maybe you don't.

35:52.875 --> 35:54.866
I went to school with a kid
named Andy Jarrett...

35:54.875 --> 35:56.866
Hey, I don't wanna hear this!

35:56.875 --> 35:58.331
Just shut up and listen!

35:58.333 --> 36:00.324
He was a junior safecracker,
real smart.

36:00.333 --> 36:02.324
Kept bragging how he could
break into anything

36:02.875 --> 36:03.864
if he really wanted to.

36:03.875 --> 36:06.366
Well, things started
disappearing from lockers.

36:06.875 --> 36:09.366
Everybody knew it was Andy,
but nobody could prove it.

36:09.375 --> 36:13.368
Then one day I opened up mine
and my knife is gone.

36:13.375 --> 36:15.366
I knew who did it.

36:15.375 --> 36:18.867
So I waited until after school,
and I busted his nose.

36:18.875 --> 36:21.366
Yeah? But you got
your knife back, right?

36:21.375 --> 36:23.366
That's right.

36:23.375 --> 36:25.912
When I got home,
it was sitting on my desk

36:26.375 --> 36:27.364
right where I left it.

36:29.375 --> 36:31.912
You sure you got your facts
straight, Luther?

36:35.375 --> 36:36.911
Think about it.

36:53.917 --> 36:56.408
You're gonna die.

36:56.417 --> 36:58.908
I wanna know what
went down that night,

36:58.917 --> 37:00.407
why you killed him.

37:03.417 --> 37:04.907
I didn't do it.

37:07.417 --> 37:10.409
I came around the alley

37:10.417 --> 37:14.956
and I saw your brother buying
crack from some junkie.

37:14.959 --> 37:18.406
The junkie took his money
and planted the steel.

37:18.417 --> 37:20.408
And then he saw me and flew.

37:20.417 --> 37:23.409
He left your brother
there in the street.

37:23.959 --> 37:24.948
You're lying, man.

37:25.417 --> 37:27.453
No, man.

37:27.458 --> 37:30.950
I lied then.

37:30.959 --> 37:33.951
My friend Lorenyo was with me.

37:34.458 --> 37:37.450
He backed me up.

37:37.458 --> 37:43.454
That's... that's how
I became apachuco, man.

37:43.458 --> 37:45.995
How I got my respect.

37:46.001 --> 37:47.992
It was my only chance.

37:48.001 --> 37:49.992
No.

37:50.001 --> 37:51.992
If you get outta here,

37:52.001 --> 37:56.449
you find Lorenyo
and you ask him.

37:57.001 --> 37:58.457
You're lying.

37:58.458 --> 37:59.994
Believe it, man.

38:57.000 --> 38:57.989
I'm over the airstrip.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.536
Looks like they're long gone.

38:59.542 --> 39:00.998
Let's retrace their
original flight plan.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.536
Affirmative.

39:02.542 --> 39:04.533
I know I am responsible
for the program.

39:04.542 --> 39:07.033
We're doing everything
we can to locate them.

39:07.041 --> 39:09.532
Look, my best friend
is out there.

39:09.542 --> 39:11.032
Get the Forest Service
on the line.

39:11.041 --> 39:12.030
See what they've come up with.

39:15.041 --> 39:17.532
You got your
300 yards, MacGyver.

39:17.542 --> 39:19.533
Okay, now we dig.

39:19.542 --> 39:21.533
We need a foot-deep trough

39:21.542 --> 39:23.533
straight down that line
you just surveyed.

39:23.542 --> 39:25.533
You got it.

39:25.542 --> 39:27.578
Looks like you're gonna
be slinging some mud.

39:27.583 --> 39:28.572
Great.

39:39.041 --> 39:41.032
I wanna know
what went down that night,

39:41.041 --> 39:42.577
why you killed him.

39:43.041 --> 39:44.030
I didn't do it.

40:02.583 --> 40:04.073
You're lying, man.

40:04.083 --> 40:06.074
I lied then.

40:06.083 --> 40:08.074
My friend Lorenyo was with me.

40:08.625 --> 40:11.617
He backed me up.

40:18.625 --> 40:20.616
That's how I became
apachuco, man.

40:20.625 --> 40:22.081
No.

40:54.125 --> 40:56.116
It was my only chance.

40:56.125 --> 40:57.661
You're lying.

40:57.667 --> 40:59.658
Believe it, man. Believe it.

42:01.208 --> 42:05.201
The remainder of their flight
plan is over civiliyation, sir.

42:05.208 --> 42:09.201
That means they went down way
off course, doesn't it?

42:09.208 --> 42:12.208
There's a thousand square miles

42:12.208 --> 42:14.199
of rough wilderness out there.

42:14.750 --> 42:17.207
I'm sorry, it's not very hopeful

42:17.208 --> 42:20.746
You don't know MacGyver.

42:33.750 --> 42:35.240
All right, start
letting it down.

43:07.291 --> 43:09.282
All right, easy.

43:09.291 --> 43:11.782
Keep it coming.

43:11.792 --> 43:13.783
Okay, now hold it.

43:13.792 --> 43:14.781
Now forward.

43:18.792 --> 43:20.282
A little more.

43:20.291 --> 43:23.783
Pivot. Pivot!

43:25.792 --> 43:26.827
Put it down.

43:27.291 --> 43:28.280
Down?

43:28.291 --> 43:29.827
Yeah.

43:37.834 --> 43:39.825
It's gonna work,
MacGyver.

43:41.291 --> 43:43.282
It's got to.

43:52.333 --> 43:54.324
You're gonna
be okay, Ramon.

43:54.333 --> 43:55.823
Thank you.

43:56.333 --> 43:57.322
I'll send the search
plane back

43:57.333 --> 43:58.823
the minute we
land, all right?

43:58.834 --> 43:59.823
Take it easy, MacGyver.

43:59.834 --> 44:01.324
I'll do my best.

44:10.875 --> 44:12.331
I've been a real...

44:12.333 --> 44:15.325
You're gonna be
just fine, Ramon.

44:15.333 --> 44:17.324
If we don't crash.

45:01.917 --> 45:03.908
Oh...
Come on.

45:06.917 --> 45:07.906
Go.
Please...

45:09.917 --> 45:10.406
Come on.

45:39.959 --> 45:42.416
You did it, man.

45:42.959 --> 45:45.416
Primo.

45:45.417 --> 45:47.453
Now all I gotta do
is find an airport,

45:47.458 --> 45:51.451
get them to lay down
some foam... and land.

45:51.458 --> 45:53.449
That's all.

45:53.458 --> 45:55.449
If you can do what you just did,

45:55.959 --> 45:57.950
you could land
this thing on the moon.

46:37.500 --> 46:38.990
Yo!

46:39.001 --> 46:40.491
How was your flight?

46:40.500 --> 46:42.491
Aw, I've been on worse.

46:42.500 --> 46:45.992
Hey, how is he?

46:46.001 --> 46:47.491
Ramon's gonna make it.

46:47.500 --> 46:49.491
Looks to me like they're
all gonna make it.

46:49.500 --> 46:50.489
Nice going, Mac.

46:50.500 --> 46:52.491
No, Pete, I had help
on this one.

46:52.500 --> 46:53.489
So what's the secret?

46:54.000 --> 46:54.989
I guess you could say.

46:55.500 --> 46:56.990
they found something
worth going for.
