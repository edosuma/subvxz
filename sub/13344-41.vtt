WEBVTT

00:05.773 --> 00:08.008
Man:
PREVIOUSLY ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.109 --> 00:10.078
MY DAD IS THE MOST
IMPORTANT PERSON TO ME

00:10.178 --> 00:11.479
IN THIS WHOLE WORLD.

00:11.579 --> 00:13.414
YOU'VE TRIED TO KILL
YOURSELF, SOPHIE,

00:13.514 --> 00:16.650
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO TELL
THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON
IN YOUR WORLD?

00:16.750 --> 00:18.152
HE HAS A LIFE!

00:18.252 --> 00:20.221
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT
THAT I TOOK THOSE PILLS!

00:20.321 --> 00:22.256
I'M NOT SAYING
IT IS HIS FAULT.

00:22.356 --> 00:23.524
I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

00:23.624 --> 00:25.426
WHY YOU WERE SO READY
TO LEAVE THE PLANET

00:25.526 --> 00:27.961
AND NOT TELL HIM.
ARE YOU ANGRY AT HIM
FOR SOMETHING?

00:28.062 --> 00:30.030
I'M NOT ANGRY AT HIM.

00:30.131 --> 00:31.699
YOU TOLD ME ONCE
THAT YOU WANTED

00:31.799 --> 00:34.068
TO MOVE ACROSS THE COUNTRY
TO BE WITH YOUR DAD
AND HIS NEW WIFE,

00:34.168 --> 00:36.070
BUT THAT THEY DIDN'T
HAVE A ROOM FOR YOU.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.971
I TOLD YOU-- HE LEFT HER
BECAUSE OF THAT.

00:38.072 --> 00:40.174
AFTER TWO YEARS, SOPHIE.

00:41.142 --> 00:43.111
HOW COULD HE
JUST STOP LOVING ME?

00:43.211 --> 00:45.279
WHAT DID I DO?

00:58.058 --> 00:59.960
LAURA, HI.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.829
IT'S-- IT'S ME, PAUL.

01:01.929 --> 01:04.098
I HOPE YOU'RE DOING OKAY.

01:04.198 --> 01:07.868
I'M STILL HOPING
WE COULD TALK,

01:07.968 --> 01:09.470
MEET UP MAYBE,
HAVE A COFFEE.

01:11.172 --> 01:13.641
OKAY, I GUESS
I'LL TRY YOU AGAIN.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.075
BYE.

01:18.812 --> 01:22.750
( theme music playing )

01:41.735 --> 01:43.271
Zach:
HEY, DOLL.

01:47.508 --> 01:49.210
HEY.

01:49.310 --> 01:51.579
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

01:51.679 --> 01:53.214
( chuckles )

01:53.314 --> 01:56.284
WOW, GOOD TO SEE YOU TOO.

01:57.718 --> 01:59.553
COME HERE.

01:59.653 --> 02:01.855
COME HERE.
COME HERE.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.524
GIVE ME A HUG.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.559
( grunts )

02:07.261 --> 02:09.730
LOOK AT YOU.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.732
YOU'RE A KNOCKOUT.

02:11.832 --> 02:14.001
HOW ARE THESE ARMS?

02:14.101 --> 02:16.504
( makes whirring sounds )
PERFECT.

02:17.905 --> 02:20.374
HOW DID YOU KNOW
I'D BE HERE?

02:20.474 --> 02:22.410
FROM MOM.

02:22.510 --> 02:24.978
SHE WAS EAGER TO REMIND ME
YOU HAD THERAPY
THIS MORNING

02:25.078 --> 02:28.482
AND THAT YOU WERE
BENEFITING FROM THERAPY.

02:28.582 --> 02:30.584
GETTING THE ADDRESS WAS
A LITTLE HARDER, THOUGH.

02:30.684 --> 02:32.653
MAYBE SHE'S AFRAID
I'LL EMBARRASS YOU

02:32.753 --> 02:34.822
IN FRONT
OF YOUR SHRINK--

02:34.922 --> 02:36.757
PROBABLY
BECAUSE SHE HAS.

02:41.662 --> 02:46.367
SO THIS IS WHERE
THE MAGIC HAPPENS, HUH?

02:49.770 --> 02:53.006
SO I HEAR YOU KICKED ASS
AT THE TRIALS, FROM MOM.

02:53.106 --> 02:54.708
YEAH.

02:54.808 --> 02:58.346
HOW COME YOU DIDN'T
CALL ME AFTERWARDS?

02:58.446 --> 03:01.282
I WAS REALLY TIRED.
I JUST WANTED TO SLEEP.

03:01.382 --> 03:04.318
'CAUSE YOU KNEW I WAS WAITING
FOR YOUR CALL, RIGHT, KIDDO?

03:05.085 --> 03:06.487
WERE YOU?

03:07.688 --> 03:09.723
YOU COULD HAVE COME
TO THE COMPETITION.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.325
I CAN'T JUST WALK AWAY

03:11.425 --> 03:13.494
FROM STUFF, SOPHIE.
YOU KNOW THAT.

03:13.594 --> 03:15.729
AND PLUS, I DIDN'T WANT
TO JUST SHOW UP

03:15.829 --> 03:18.131
OUT OF NOWHERE
AT THE LAST MINUTE
AND SURPRISE YOU.

03:18.232 --> 03:21.269
I WAS AFRAID IT MIGHT
MAKE YOU NERVOUS.

03:24.772 --> 03:27.441
WHAT'S GOING ON?
HOW COME I HAVEN'T
HEARD FROM YOU?

03:29.643 --> 03:31.912
ARE YOU ANGRY AT ME
FOR SOMETHING?

03:35.549 --> 03:38.051
THAT'S QUITE A STARE
YOU'VE DEVELOPED THERE.

03:38.151 --> 03:40.288
IT'S KIND OF
FREAKING ME OUT.

03:40.388 --> 03:41.855
I GOTTA GET IN THERE.

03:41.955 --> 03:45.426
WAIT WAIT,
COME HERE, COME HERE.
GIVE ME A HUG.

03:45.526 --> 03:47.361
OH...

03:47.461 --> 03:52.165
I'M SO INSANELY
PROUD OF YOU,

03:52.266 --> 03:55.235
MY CRAZY,
TALENTED KID,

03:55.336 --> 03:58.539
IT JUST KILLS ME
WHEN I DON'T HEAR
FROM YOU,

03:58.639 --> 04:00.441
SLAYS ME.

04:00.541 --> 04:03.344
I DON'T EAT.
I DON'T SLEEP.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.613
I CALLED, ACTUALLY,

04:05.713 --> 04:09.182
- A COUPLE OF TIMES.
- BUT YOU DIDN'T LEAVE
ANY MESSAGES.

04:09.283 --> 04:11.419
MOM ALWAYS ANSWERS
HER CELL PHONE.

04:11.519 --> 04:13.521
I'M NOT MOM, HONEY.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.291
COME ON, LET'S GO
TALK ABOUT THIS
OVER A BITE TO EAT.

04:17.391 --> 04:20.628
- I HAVEN'T HAD LUNCH YET.
- DAD, I HAVE THERAPY NOW.

04:22.430 --> 04:24.998
RIGHT.
THERAPY.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.969
ALL RIGHT.

04:29.069 --> 04:31.339
I'LL WAIT.
WE'LL GO AFTERWARDS.

04:31.439 --> 04:33.407
- YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WAIT FOR ME.
- I DO HAVE TO.

04:33.507 --> 04:34.642
APPARENTLY,
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
I'M GONNA GET A CHANCE

04:34.742 --> 04:36.444
TO SPEND SOME TIME
WITH MY KID.

04:39.847 --> 04:42.015
SO HOW'S IT GOING

04:42.115 --> 04:44.151
WITH THIS THING--
THIS SHRINK THING?

04:44.251 --> 04:46.487
- OKAY.
- YEAH?

04:46.587 --> 04:48.021
WHAT DO YOU GUYS
TALK ABOUT?

04:48.121 --> 04:49.990
STUFF.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.059
WHAT KIND OF STUFF?

04:52.159 --> 04:56.029
BOYS STUFF,
GYMNASTICS STUFF, WHAT?

04:56.129 --> 04:58.031
SOMETIMES.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.634
YOU TALK ABOUT ME?

05:00.734 --> 05:03.003
SOMETIMES.

05:03.103 --> 05:06.440
YOU TALK ABOUT ME
IN THERE? REALLY?

05:08.342 --> 05:10.411
WE TALK ABOUT
A LOT OF THINGS, DAD.

05:10.511 --> 05:13.013
WHAT DO YOU SAY
ABOUT ME?

05:13.113 --> 05:15.282
I DON'T KNOW.

05:15.383 --> 05:17.985
YOU DON'T KNOW?

05:18.085 --> 05:21.855
IS THAT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT--
ALL THIS WEIRDNESS
BETWEEN YOU AND ME?

05:21.955 --> 05:24.124
IS THAT WHAT'S GOING ON?

05:24.224 --> 05:27.094
IT'S BECAUSE
OF THIS THERAPY?

05:27.194 --> 05:29.897
WELL, FUCK ME
WITH A RUBBER HOSE.
I'M GONNA TALK TO HIM.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.465
- DAD.
- COME ON.

05:31.565 --> 05:33.066
IT'LL JUST TAKE A SECOND.
YOU CAN COME WITH ME.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.702
IT'LL BE FUN.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.909
ARE THOSE FOR ME?

05:45.446 --> 05:48.382
I'M ZACH.
I'M SOPHIE'S FATHER.

05:48.482 --> 05:50.684
OH, NICE TO MEET YOU.

05:50.784 --> 05:53.621
NO, THESE ARE
FOR SOPHIE,

05:53.721 --> 05:55.456
FOR DOING SO WELL
AT THE TRIALS.

05:55.556 --> 05:58.025
OH, THAT'S NICE.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.361
ISN'T THAT NICE, SOFA?

06:01.462 --> 06:02.996
THERE YOU GO.

06:04.398 --> 06:08.101
SO WE THOUGHT WE'D COME IN
TOGETHER TODAY.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.270
IS THAT ALL RIGHT?

06:10.370 --> 06:11.872
DID YOU PLAN
TO COME TOGETHER?

06:11.972 --> 06:13.807
NO. HE WAS WAITING
FOR ME OUTSIDE.

06:13.907 --> 06:17.110
- DOES IT MATTER?
- ACTUALLY, IT DOES, YES.

06:17.210 --> 06:20.380
WHY?
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

06:20.481 --> 06:21.982
WELL, I'D HAVE TO TALK
TO SOPHIE

06:22.082 --> 06:24.084
AND SEE HOW SHE FEELS
ABOUT THE THREE OF US
MEETING.

06:24.184 --> 06:26.920
OH, NO, IT'S FINE.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.689
SHE'S FINE.
YOU'RE COOL WITH IT,
RIGHT, SOFA?

06:28.789 --> 06:31.459
- WHATEVER.
- IT'S COOL.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.093
CAN WE COME IN?

06:35.429 --> 06:37.064
WHY DON'T WE SCHEDULE
A MEETING--

06:37.164 --> 06:40.400
A JOINT SESSION
FOR ALL THREE OF US
NEXT WEEK?

06:40.501 --> 06:42.503
NO TIME
LIKE THE PRESENT.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.507
I THINK SOPHIE AND I
NEED TO CONSIDER

06:46.607 --> 06:49.577
WHETHER OR NOT
A JOINT SESSION WOULD BE
TO HER BENEFIT.

06:49.677 --> 06:51.512
WE NEED TIME
TO PREPARE--

06:51.612 --> 06:54.047
TIME TO PREPARE FOR WHAT?
I'M HER FATHER.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.886
- DAD, BE COOL.
- NO, I'M--

06:58.986 --> 07:01.188
- IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.
- I'M TOTALLY COOL, KIDDO.

07:01.288 --> 07:04.157
IT'S THIS GUY WHO
SEEMS TO HAVE SOMETHING
WEDGED UP HIS ASS.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.159
DAD, WE CAN DO IT
NEXT WEEK, OKAY?

07:06.259 --> 07:07.661
PLEASE.

07:30.884 --> 07:33.020
DAD, DON'T GO.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.022
I'LL TELL HIM
THAT HE HAS TO
LET YOU IN.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.624
FORGET IT.

07:36.724 --> 07:38.526
HE'S JUST TRYING
TO PROTECT ME.

07:38.626 --> 07:41.495
PROTECT YOU? FROM WHAT?
FROM YOUR DAD?

07:41.595 --> 07:43.430
OH, GOOD.
THAT'S A RELIEF.

07:43.531 --> 07:45.098
I'LL TELL HIM
THAT I'LL CANCEL THE SESSION

07:45.198 --> 07:47.234
IF YOU DON'T COME IN.

07:47.334 --> 07:48.802
DO YOU HONESTLY THINK

07:48.902 --> 07:50.771
I WOULD GO BACK
IN THERE NOW?

07:50.871 --> 07:54.041
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW HUMILIATING THAT WAS--

07:54.141 --> 07:56.176
ME STANDING IN FRONT
OF YOUR THERAPIST

07:56.276 --> 07:59.079
LIKE I'M--
I'M WHAT?

07:59.179 --> 08:01.314
WHAT DOES HE THINK
I AM?

08:01.414 --> 08:03.984
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

08:04.084 --> 08:05.919
ARE YOU ACTUALLY TAKING
THIS GUY SERIOUSLY?

08:06.019 --> 08:10.023
IT'S LIKE HE'S
BRAINWASHING YOU
OR SOMETHING.

08:11.458 --> 08:14.662
BRAINWASHING ME
ABOUT WHAT?

08:14.762 --> 08:18.666
YOU HAVE TO PREPARE
TO MEET WITH YOUR DAD?

08:18.766 --> 08:21.034
BOY, IS THAT BULLSHIT.

08:25.205 --> 08:29.176
YOU CAN'T EVEN LOOK ME
IN THE EYE. BOY...

08:29.276 --> 08:31.278
THAT JUST
BREAKS MY HEART.

08:34.548 --> 08:37.250
I RAISED YOU TO BE
SMARTER THAN THIS.

08:38.451 --> 08:40.754
YOU DIDN'T REALLY
RAISE ME.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.424
EXCUSE ME?

08:44.524 --> 08:47.194
MOST OF THE TIME
YOU WERE FAR AWAY.

08:50.998 --> 08:53.200
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WHAT I'M HEARING.

09:13.020 --> 09:16.523
HE SAID HE'D NEVER
BEEN MORE HUMILIATED
IN HIS WHOLE LIFE.

09:16.624 --> 09:18.626
I CAN'T LET HIM IN
WITHOUT AN APPOINTMENT.

09:18.726 --> 09:22.129
- HE'S MY FATHER.
- EVEN STILL.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.231
YOU LET MY MOTHER IN.

09:24.331 --> 09:27.300
WE'D MADE AN APPOINTMENT
WITH YOUR MOTHER
AHEAD OF TIME.

09:28.636 --> 09:30.570
WHY COULDN'T YOU JUST
LET HIM IN?

09:30.671 --> 09:32.339
IT WOULDN'T HAVE
BOTHERED ME.

09:32.439 --> 09:33.641
I KNOW YOU'RE USED
TO YOUR FATHER

09:33.741 --> 09:35.809
COMING IN AND OUT
OF YOUR LIFE,

09:35.909 --> 09:37.911
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
IT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU.

09:38.011 --> 09:40.648
IN FACT, I SUSPECT
IT BOTHERS YOU VERY MUCH.

09:40.748 --> 09:43.416
AND HE'S NOT EXEMPT
FROM THE RULES
OF THIS OFFICE.

09:43.516 --> 09:45.986
YOU AND YOUR
FUCKING RULES.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.689
IF YOUR WIFE WALKED IN,
WOULD YOU CHASE HER AWAY,

09:48.789 --> 09:50.658
TELL HER TO COME BACK
NEXT WEEK?

09:50.758 --> 09:53.226
I WOULD ABSOLUTELY
TELL HER OR ANYONE ELSE

09:53.326 --> 09:55.963
IF I THOUGHT
THEIR PRESENCE IN MY OFFICE
WAS INAPPROPRIATE.

09:56.063 --> 09:58.699
I NEED TIME
TO PREPARE FOR A SESSION

09:58.799 --> 10:00.768
WITH BOTH YOU
AND YOUR FATHER.

10:00.868 --> 10:02.703
SO IT WASN'T EVEN
ABOUT ME AT ALL.

10:02.803 --> 10:04.838
YOU'RE SO FULL OF IT.

10:07.374 --> 10:08.876
WHAT?

10:08.976 --> 10:11.712
I SUDDENLY UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOUR MOTHER
MUST FEEL.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.516
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

10:16.616 --> 10:18.786
YOU'RE EASY
ON YOUR FATHER.

10:18.886 --> 10:21.789
HE DISAPPEARS FOR MONTHS,
THEN BARGES IN UNANNOUNCED,

10:21.889 --> 10:23.857
WANTS TO BREAK
INTO YOUR THERAPY.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.293
HE INVADES
YOUR PRIVATE SPACE,

10:26.393 --> 10:28.628
BUT STILL
YOU DEFEND HIM.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.698
HE IS ALWAYS THE KING.

10:31.631 --> 10:32.900
WELL, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO WORRY

10:33.000 --> 10:34.902
BECAUSE HE'S NEVER
COMING BACK HERE AGAIN.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.870
SO YOU CAN HAVE
YOUR CROWN BACK.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.572
OKAY, LET'S SAY
HE DOES COME BACK--

10:39.673 --> 10:41.174
- HE WON'T.
- BUT LET'S SAY

10:41.274 --> 10:43.410
WE WERE ABLE
TO GET HIM HERE.
WOULD YOU WANT THAT?

10:43.510 --> 10:45.078
YES.

10:45.178 --> 10:47.314
WHY?

10:47.414 --> 10:50.383
BECAUSE IT'S
IMPORTANT TO HIM.
ISN'T THAT OBVIOUS?

10:50.483 --> 10:52.219
TO HIM OR TO YOU?

10:56.690 --> 10:59.126
- DON'T YOU HAVE KIDS?
- YOU KNOW I DO.

10:59.226 --> 11:02.629
WELL, DON'T YOU
EVER DO THINGS
JUST TO MAKE THEM HAPPY?

11:02.730 --> 11:04.965
THAT'S A VERY DIFFERENT
SITUATION, SOPHIE.

11:05.065 --> 11:05.966
NOT REALLY.

11:06.066 --> 11:09.002
HE IS THE PARENT,
NOT YOU.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.204
SO WHAT?

11:13.473 --> 11:16.576
- YOU DON'T SEE
THE DIFFERENCE?
- DON'T PATRONIZE ME!

11:16.676 --> 11:19.880
I AM NOT
PATRONIZING YOU.

11:19.980 --> 11:22.082
THESE ARE YOUR SESSIONS,
SOPHIE, NOT HIS.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.752
ONE OF THE REASONS
EVEN ADULTS GO
INTO THERAPY

11:24.852 --> 11:26.987
IS TO SEPARATE
WHO THEY ARE

11:27.087 --> 11:29.456
FROM WHAT OTHER PEOPLE
WANT THEM TO BE.

11:32.659 --> 11:34.494
DO YOU ANALYZE
YOUR DAUGHTER TOO?

11:34.594 --> 11:36.730
NO, I TRY NOT TO.

11:36.830 --> 11:39.299
- WHY NOT?
- BECAUSE IT'S JUST
NOT A GOOD IDEA.

11:39.399 --> 11:42.202
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO TREAT
ONE'S OWN CHILDREN.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.204
WHY?

11:44.304 --> 11:45.873
PARENTS PLAY A BIG ROLE

11:45.973 --> 11:47.941
IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF
THE CHILD'S PERSONALITY.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.543
SO AS A DOCTOR IT WOULD
BE VERY HARD FOR ME

11:50.643 --> 11:52.479
TO KEEP
MY ROLE AS A FATHER

11:52.579 --> 11:55.015
SEPARATE
FROM THE THERAPY.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.484
BECAUSE YOU ARE
PART OF THE PROBLEM.

11:58.485 --> 11:59.953
CORRECT.

12:03.290 --> 12:05.525
I COULDN'T EVEN TELL HIM
ABOUT MY ACCIDENT.

12:05.625 --> 12:07.761
THAT IS SO FUCKED UP.

12:09.997 --> 12:13.066
- ( gate opens, closes )
- OH, SHIT.

12:20.073 --> 12:23.176
LET HIM IN, PAUL.
LET'S JUST DO THIS.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.513
I WANT TO TALK TO HIM.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.082
ARE YOU SURE?

12:34.587 --> 12:36.023
OKAY.

12:39.192 --> 12:41.394
I NEED YOU
TO LISTEN TO ME--

12:41.494 --> 12:43.230
COME ON IN, PLEASE.

12:48.535 --> 12:50.470
OH, YOU'VE DECIDED
IT'S OKAY,

12:50.570 --> 12:52.505
DAD IS NOT A LEPER?

12:52.605 --> 12:55.108
WOULD YOU CARE
TO SIT DOWN?

13:20.000 --> 13:22.202
ALL RIGHT, YOU SAID

13:22.302 --> 13:23.971
I DIDN'T RAISE YOU

13:24.071 --> 13:26.573
AND THAT I WASN'T THERE
FOR YOU.

13:26.673 --> 13:29.376
SO WHILE I WAS OUTSIDE

13:29.476 --> 13:31.444
I MADE A LIST.

13:39.552 --> 13:42.322
EVERY MORNING

13:42.422 --> 13:44.524
FROM THE TIME
YOU WERE SIX
UNTIL YOU WERE 10,

13:44.624 --> 13:49.196
I WOULD GET UP
WITH YOU AT 5:00,

13:49.296 --> 13:50.964
GET YOU DRESSED

13:51.064 --> 13:52.966
AND TAKE YOU
TO PRACTICE.

13:53.066 --> 13:55.402
AND I WOULD WAIT
OUTSIDE OF PRACTICE

13:55.502 --> 13:58.605
UNTIL YOU WERE DONE,
SO I COULD TAKE YOU
TO SCHOOL.

14:02.309 --> 14:05.045
AND THEN I WOULD
STAY UP WITH YOU,

14:07.881 --> 14:09.082
SO YOU COULD DO
YOUR HOMEWORK--

14:09.182 --> 14:11.618
BECAUSE YOU'D FALL ASLEEP
IF I DIDN'T.

14:14.787 --> 14:19.659
EXCEPT I SUCKED AT MATH,

14:19.759 --> 14:22.829
SO I GOT EVENING
TUTORING LESSONS

14:22.930 --> 14:25.165
THREE NIGHTS A WEEK.

14:30.803 --> 14:32.906
AND WHEN YOU--

14:35.375 --> 14:37.044
WHEN--

14:37.144 --> 14:39.312
WHEN YOU COULDN'T SLEEP,

14:41.648 --> 14:43.283
I WOULD HOLD YOU...

14:47.620 --> 14:50.590
AND DANCE WITH YOU
UNTIL YOU WOULD
GO TO SLEEP.

14:55.895 --> 14:59.933
AND WHEN YOU GOT INJURED,
I SAT WITH YOU
IN THE HOSPITAL

15:00.033 --> 15:02.435
DAY AND NIGHT.

15:05.038 --> 15:06.873
ENOUGH, DAD.
IT'S OKAY.

15:06.974 --> 15:09.842
JUST DON'T TELL ME
I DIDN'T RAISE YOU.

15:09.943 --> 15:14.614
I MEAN, DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEA

15:14.714 --> 15:16.283
HOW MUCH IT KILLS ME

15:16.383 --> 15:18.718
WHEN I DON'T HEAR
FROM YOU FOR TWO WEEKS?

15:18.818 --> 15:20.253
I CAN'T EAT.

15:20.353 --> 15:22.089
I CAN'T SLEEP.

15:22.189 --> 15:26.559
GOD, LOOK, MY HANDS
ARE SHAKING.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.331
YOU DIDN'T SEE ME
FOR ALMOST THREE YEARS.

15:31.431 --> 15:34.501
IT DIDN'T SEEM TO MATTER
SO MUCH THEN.

15:37.037 --> 15:39.872
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

15:39.973 --> 15:42.675
WHEN YOU MOVED TO NEW YORK
WITH THAT WOMAN.

15:46.413 --> 15:48.915
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH ANYTHING?

15:49.016 --> 15:50.683
WE SPOKE ON THE PHONE
EVERY DAY.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.352
IT WASN'T
THE SAME THING.

15:52.452 --> 15:55.989
I KNEW EVERYTHING
THAT WAS GOING ON
WITH YOU.

15:56.089 --> 15:58.391
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

16:05.965 --> 16:09.002
WELL, IT WAS TWO YEARS,
NOT THREE.

16:09.102 --> 16:10.770
TWO AND A HALF.

16:10.870 --> 16:13.006
LOOK, KIDDO...

16:14.674 --> 16:18.878
YOU KNEW
THAT I WANTED YOU
LIVE WITH US.

16:18.978 --> 16:22.149
- IT NEVER HAPPENED.
- WHICH IS WHY I LEFT.

16:22.249 --> 16:24.484
AFTER TWO AND A HALF
YEARS.

16:24.584 --> 16:27.120
WE NEVER WENT A DAY
WITHOUT SPEAKING.

16:27.220 --> 16:29.089
I WAS STILL
PART OF YOUR LIFE.

16:29.189 --> 16:31.291
YOU KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT ME NOW.

16:31.391 --> 16:34.361
WHY DO YOU
KEEP SAYING THAT?
WHAT HAVEN'T YOU TOLD ME?

16:34.461 --> 16:36.363
YOU KNEW
HOW DEPRESSED MOM WAS.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.865
YOU KNEW IT SUCKED
BEING AT HOME.

16:38.965 --> 16:40.200
I WANTED TO COME
LIVE WITH YOU.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.668
AND I WANTED THAT TOO.

16:41.768 --> 16:44.404
APPARENTLY NOT BADLY ENOUGH.

16:45.805 --> 16:46.906
I LEFT HER.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.775
AFTER TWO AND A HALF YEARS!

16:48.875 --> 16:51.010
I LEFT HER, SOPHIE.

16:51.111 --> 16:55.482
I LOVED HER
AND I LEFT HER FOR YOU.

16:55.582 --> 16:57.817
AND IF SHE CHANGED HER MIND
AND LET YOU COME
LIVE WITH US,

16:57.917 --> 17:00.453
I WOULD GO BACK TO HER
IN AN INSTANT.

17:01.754 --> 17:04.691
TO THE WOMAN WHO WOULDN'T
TAKE YOUR DAUGHTER IN,

17:05.525 --> 17:07.160
RIGHT?

17:18.705 --> 17:21.574
SOMETIMES GROWNUP THINGS
ARE JUST HARD TO EXPLAIN.

17:21.674 --> 17:24.244
GROWNUP THINGS?

17:24.344 --> 17:26.679
GROWNUP THINGS?
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

17:26.779 --> 17:29.949
JUST GO.
LEAVE.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.652
I DON'T WANT YOU
HERE ANYMORE.

17:39.559 --> 17:42.229
YOU THINK YOU CAN WALK
IN AND OUT OF MY LIFE

17:42.329 --> 17:45.165
LIKE I'M SOME SORT OF
FUCKING TRAIN STATION?

17:45.265 --> 17:47.200
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

17:47.300 --> 17:50.337
IS THIS WHAT HE TELLS YOU?
IS THIS WHAT YOUR MOTHER
TELLS YOU?

17:50.437 --> 17:52.071
THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH HER.

17:52.172 --> 17:53.506
THIS IS ABOUT ME.

17:53.606 --> 17:55.408
ABOUT YOU?

17:55.508 --> 17:58.545
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU?

17:58.645 --> 18:00.913
- DO YOU?
- YOU CAN'T LOVE ME.

18:01.013 --> 18:02.449
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ME!

18:02.549 --> 18:04.884
WHY DO YOU
KEEP SAYING THAT?
I'M YOUR FATHER.

18:04.984 --> 18:06.419
WHO KNOWS YOU BETTER
THAN I DO?

18:06.519 --> 18:07.820
HE DOES.

18:15.495 --> 18:16.863
HE DOES?

18:18.798 --> 18:21.334
REALLY?
BUT YOU'RE NOT
THE FATHER, ARE YOU?

18:21.434 --> 18:23.270
ONE DAY A WEEK
FOR A FEW WEEKS--

18:23.370 --> 18:24.604
IT'S NOT REALLY
THE SAME THING

18:24.704 --> 18:26.973
AS THE FIRST SEVEN YEARS,
IS IT, DOCTOR?

18:27.073 --> 18:28.808
NO, IT'S NOT.

18:32.379 --> 18:34.481
AND WHAT DO YOU HAVE
TO SAY TO THIS?

18:34.581 --> 18:37.750
OR IS THIS JUST YOUR VOICE
COMING THROUGH HER MOUTH?

18:37.850 --> 18:41.221
I'VE BEEN
LISTENING TO SOPHIE
FOR QUITE A WHILE NOW

18:41.321 --> 18:44.056
AND WHAT I HEAR
FROM HER

18:44.157 --> 18:48.094
IS A GREAT ANGER
AND RESENTMENT.

18:48.195 --> 18:50.163
BUT I ALSO HEAR
FROM HER

18:50.263 --> 18:52.932
THE NEED FOR YOU
TO RECLAIM

18:53.032 --> 18:55.535
YOUR RELATIONSHIP
AND TO FIGHT FOR IT.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.161
I--

19:25.432 --> 19:27.734
I NEVER STOPPED
LOVING YOU.

19:31.137 --> 19:33.540
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

19:33.640 --> 19:37.143
YOU WEREN'T THERE.
YOU CHOSE HER.

19:37.244 --> 19:40.813
NO, I DIDN'T PLAN IT
THAT WAY.

19:40.913 --> 19:43.583
IF I COULD DO IT
OVER AGAIN--

19:43.683 --> 19:44.517
YOU CAN'T.

19:44.617 --> 19:45.985
I KNOW, I KNOW,
BUT IF I COULD--

19:46.085 --> 19:47.820
YOU CAN'T.

19:49.121 --> 19:52.792
YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING
OVER AGAIN.

19:52.892 --> 19:55.828
YOU CAN'T SAY YOU'RE SORRY
AND MAKE IT BETTER.

19:55.928 --> 19:57.997
YOU CAN'T

19:58.097 --> 20:01.033
MAKE SOMEBODY TRUST YOU
IF THEY DON'T.

20:01.133 --> 20:04.337
AND YOU CAN'T
PUT A FAMILY BACK TOGETHER.

20:04.437 --> 20:06.573
IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT.

20:06.673 --> 20:09.976
THAT'S GROWNUP.

20:21.588 --> 20:24.724
DID YOU KNOW I TRIED
TO KILL MYSELF?

20:28.895 --> 20:30.330
WHAT?

20:32.932 --> 20:34.567
WHEN?

20:37.103 --> 20:39.539
I DIDN'T HAVE
AN ACCIDENT.

20:40.873 --> 20:43.976
I RODE MY BIKE
INTO A CAR ON PURPOSE.

20:44.076 --> 20:47.380
I GOT TIRED
OF BEING ALIVE.

20:49.816 --> 20:51.351
OH, GOD, KIDDO.

20:55.388 --> 20:57.857
I WANT YOU
TO LEAVE NOW, OKAY?

20:57.957 --> 20:59.459
NO. NO. NO.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.461
- PLEASE.
- SOPHIE, PLEASE.

21:01.561 --> 21:03.663
- NO.
- I WANT TO STAY.
PLEASE.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.432
LET ME STAY, PLEASE.

21:09.068 --> 21:11.304
IT'S MY THERAPY,

21:13.105 --> 21:14.741
MINE.

22:08.728 --> 22:11.431
JESUS, I KICKED
MY FATHER OUT.

22:13.299 --> 22:15.167
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

22:15.267 --> 22:17.904
THIS IS A GREAT INSIGHT
THAT YOU HAD,

22:20.339 --> 22:21.908
THAT YOU HAVE THE POWER

22:22.008 --> 22:23.876
TO LET YOUR
PARENTS INTO YOUR LIFE
WHEN YOU WANT THEM

22:23.976 --> 22:25.645
AND TO KEEP THEM OUT
WHEN YOU DON'T
WANT THEM.

22:25.745 --> 22:28.781
I THINK IT'S A SIGN
OF MATURITY.

22:33.720 --> 22:36.355
I'LL PROBABLY
NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN.

22:36.456 --> 22:39.158
I THINK YOU WILL.

22:39.258 --> 22:42.662
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE HE'LL REALIZE

22:42.762 --> 22:44.631
THAT HE'S CAUSED YOU PAIN

22:44.731 --> 22:49.201
AND THAT THIS WILL
CHANGE HIM.

22:49.301 --> 22:51.303
PEOPLE CAN CHANGE,
YOU KNOW.

22:51.404 --> 22:52.972
YOU THINK?

22:53.072 --> 22:54.474
MM-HMM.

22:54.574 --> 22:56.576
I THINK YOU'VE CHANGED.

23:06.419 --> 23:09.288
I'M GOING TO GO OUT
AND SEE IF I CAN CATCH HIM.

23:09.388 --> 23:10.890
OKAY.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.664
I'M GOING AWAY TO DENVER
TO TRAIN.

23:23.836 --> 23:26.573
I WANT TO BE BY MYSELF
FOR A WHILE,

23:27.940 --> 23:29.976
TO TAKE CARE OF MYSELF

23:31.110 --> 23:32.812
WITHOUT MY MOM

23:33.813 --> 23:35.114
OR YOU.

23:36.849 --> 23:38.451
NO OFFENSE.

23:39.251 --> 23:41.087
NO OFFENSE TAKEN.

23:43.656 --> 23:45.792
I'VE GOT TO
RUN IT BY MY MOM,

23:45.892 --> 23:48.661
BUT I THINK SHE'LL BE
OKAY WITH IT.

23:54.501 --> 23:56.235
IT'S GOOD.

23:56.335 --> 23:58.505
IT'S WHAT
I WANT NOW.

24:00.573 --> 24:02.842
YOU KNOW YOU CAN CALL ME
ANY TIME YOU WANT.

24:05.377 --> 24:06.646
YEAH YEAH,

24:06.746 --> 24:08.815
I KNOW THE DRILL, DOCTOR.

24:38.645 --> 24:41.080
ARE THERE
HUGGING RULES TOO, PAUL?

24:42.281 --> 24:43.716
YEP.

24:55.394 --> 24:57.697
FAREWELL, OLD FART.

24:59.265 --> 25:00.600
FAREWELL, YOUNG FART.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.869
( both chuckle )

25:04.370 --> 25:07.607
TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF, OKAY?

25:29.829 --> 25:32.565
- IS IT OKAY?
- SURE.

25:34.100 --> 25:35.902
SO WHAT'S GOING ON?

25:36.002 --> 25:38.437
I JUST SAW
THAT PATIENT LEAVING.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.239
DID YOU KNOW SHE USED
TO GO TO MY SCHOOL?

25:40.339 --> 25:42.809
YEAH.

25:42.909 --> 25:45.277
- IS THAT HER DAD?
- MM-HMM.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.047
HE LOOKS COOL.

25:50.316 --> 25:51.918
WHY ARE YOU SMILING?

25:53.620 --> 25:55.054
NO REASON.

26:00.660 --> 26:02.629
MOM SEEMS
A LITTLE TENSE.

26:02.729 --> 26:05.865
YOU MEAN, ABOUT HER DAUGHTER
DISAPPEARING INTO THE NIGHT?

26:05.965 --> 26:08.935
NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEAN.

26:11.503 --> 26:14.140
YOU GUYS ARE TALKING
ABOUT EVERYTHING, RIGHT?

26:14.240 --> 26:16.575
YEAH, WELL, WE'RE--

26:16.676 --> 26:18.310
WE'RE TRYING.

26:34.761 --> 26:38.731
( soft music playing )
