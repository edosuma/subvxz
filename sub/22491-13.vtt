00:18.852 --> 00:20.683
It's alive!

00:43.410 --> 00:45.002
We're going down!

00:45.045 --> 00:47.479
Hello?
Come on, this is ridiculous.

00:47.514 --> 00:53.111
Is this button even connected
to anything? Hello? Hello?

00:53.153 --> 00:55.951
Must Love Dogs,
that's a good in-flight movie, huh?

00:59.225 --> 01:02.388
What can I tell you?
I had a grandmother from hell, OK?

01:02.429 --> 01:04.260
She was a Jewish juggler...

01:04.297 --> 01:06.595
she used to worry
about six things at once.

01:06.633 --> 01:08.498
That's reasonably funny.

01:08.535 --> 01:12.369
- Come on! Let's fly!
- I can fly!

01:12.405 --> 01:14.202
To the sky!

01:15.508 --> 01:18.477
Remember to think
happy thoughts before you...

01:25.718 --> 01:26.844
May I help you, son?

01:26.886 --> 01:29.980
My dad said I could get a bitchin' sweet
ride for my birthday...

01:30.023 --> 01:32.457
but it has to be under 500 bones.

01:32.492 --> 01:36.053
- I think I have just the thing.
- What the hell is this?

01:36.096 --> 01:38.530
Oh, no, no.
Hold it like so.

01:40.433 --> 01:41.559
What's it doing?

01:58.618 --> 02:02.645
- Pull this thing over, right now!
- I don't know how to stop!

02:06.759 --> 02:09.592
This is freakin' awesome!

02:20.340 --> 02:24.003
- I have a very small penis.
- So you're looking for an SUV?

02:24.043 --> 02:27.171
- A very, very small penis.
- Perhaps a Hummer H2?

02:28.214 --> 02:31.547
You are misinterpreting
the insignificance of this penis.

02:31.584 --> 02:34.644
- It's literally concave.
- I think I have just the thing.

02:34.687 --> 02:37.918
Yes! Yes!
This is very satisfying.

02:37.957 --> 02:40.858
Look at the size of my phantom penis.

02:44.864 --> 02:47.526
This is some serious bullshit.

02:47.567 --> 02:50.866
If only we had
Rainbow Brite's Magic Star Sprinkles!

02:50.904 --> 02:53.634
We'd turn the whole world gray.

02:53.673 --> 02:55.368
Guys, every night with this.

02:55.408 --> 02:58.206
What's so great about turning
the world gray, anyway?

02:58.244 --> 03:01.008
Well, it's really more of a metaphor.

03:01.047 --> 03:04.414
I mean, if you want to do
something evil, arson is pretty evil.

03:04.450 --> 03:06.077
Look, just... Shut up!

03:06.119 --> 03:09.054
I say we break
into Rainbow Brite's place...

03:09.088 --> 03:12.182
and take all
the Star Sprinkles we want.

03:21.668 --> 03:23.898
None here.
What's under the sink?

03:23.937 --> 03:25.632
Tampons.

03:25.672 --> 03:27.640
Game over, man! Game over!

03:27.674 --> 03:30.768
Rainbow Brite's gonna kick our asses
if she finds us in here!

03:33.046 --> 03:36.072
Good God, what a day.

03:43.356 --> 03:47.053
Damn, I was holding that in for hours.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.837
I'm Rick James, bitch.

04:00.006 --> 04:03.908
Black people are so much funnier
than white people.

04:05.478 --> 04:09.642
Damn, I am effin' starvin'.

04:16.723 --> 04:18.623
Intruders!

04:18.658 --> 04:20.990
Let's get the fuck out of here, man!

04:29.502 --> 04:31.732
You're a bitch!

04:33.940 --> 04:37.967
"Dear citizens of Rainbow Land,
we have changed our ways...

04:38.011 --> 04:41.640
"and are moving to Tibet
to help battle Chinese tyranny. "

04:41.681 --> 04:43.239
Signed, Murky and Lurky.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.513
I knew those guys weren't so bad.

04:45.551 --> 04:49.112
Has anyone seen my cousin Blinky?
He hasn't been around lately.

04:49.155 --> 04:51.715
"P.S. Blinky came with us. "

04:54.927 --> 04:57.225
Rom Spaceknight!

04:57.263 --> 04:59.458
A warrior made of solid metal.

04:59.499 --> 05:02.297
He's beaten
the galaxy's toughest villains...

05:02.335 --> 05:06.032
but now faces a foe
in every way his equal.

05:06.072 --> 05:09.667
Jim, the guy with a giant magnet!

05:09.709 --> 05:11.040
- Come here.
- No.

05:11.077 --> 05:12.271
- Come on.
- Nuh-uh.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.779
- Chicken.
- You are!

05:13.813 --> 05:16.543
- Rom Spacechicken.
- Mature.

05:16.582 --> 05:18.743
Yeah, your mom
was mature last night.

05:18.785 --> 05:19.877
- What?
- Did her.

05:19.919 --> 05:22.615
- I'll teach you!
- Teach this.

05:22.655 --> 05:25.385
- Where's your gun now?
- I didn't need it anyway.

05:25.425 --> 05:27.825
- Rommy, it's on the magnet.
- You suck.

05:27.860 --> 05:31.227
- That's what your mom said.
- She did not, my mom was a saint!

05:31.264 --> 05:32.856
Saints suck.

05:32.899 --> 05:35.493
- How much is the doggy in the window?
- Which one?

05:35.535 --> 05:37.196
The one with the waggly tail.

05:37.236 --> 05:39.966
You don't want that one.
He's got cancer.

05:40.006 --> 05:43.237
We've gotta get to that treasure
before those bandits do.

05:43.276 --> 05:44.903
That means we'll have to go...

05:44.944 --> 05:48.072
into the blue.

05:48.114 --> 05:51.083
Hi, I'm Robot Chicken
Executive Producer Seth Green.

05:51.117 --> 05:53.517
Because animation
takes months to produce...

05:53.553 --> 05:57.182
we often write our movie parodies
before the films have been released.

05:57.223 --> 05:59.316
- Into the blue?
- Into the blue.

05:59.359 --> 06:02.453
I hope you've enjoyed
this parody of the movie Into the Blue...

06:02.495 --> 06:05.396
which I'm sure by now
has been a box office blockbuster...

06:05.431 --> 06:08.366
and nominated for several
Academy Awards. Thank you.

06:08.401 --> 06:12.303
- I'm in a bikini.
- I do lots of sit-ups.

06:14.474 --> 06:16.738
Damn it.
I hit the apple.

06:20.580 --> 06:23.048
Where the hell is all the gauze?

06:23.082 --> 06:24.481
No, stop!

06:24.517 --> 06:26.815
- Mummy time!
- You're so scary!

06:26.853 --> 06:30.550
Momma,
can my new curfew be midnight?

06:30.590 --> 06:33.218
Yeah. When pigs fly.

06:34.260 --> 06:37.195
You heard the lady, Oinky.

06:42.635 --> 06:43.761
Midnight it is.

06:45.338 --> 06:49.104
Wait, wait, wait,
he's under a blanket. He's safe.

06:51.677 --> 06:54.043
Get him, get him, get him!
I love beatin' kids!

07:01.187 --> 07:02.381
Take that!

07:02.422 --> 07:06.256
Young man, if you are not going
to use that staff of Ra properly...

07:06.292 --> 07:08.419
then you can't use it at all.

07:08.461 --> 07:11.362
You'll get this back
at the end of the week.

07:11.397 --> 07:15.731
Indy! You have to help me.
Those boys stole my dolly!

07:22.975 --> 07:24.408
What do you want, Henry?

07:35.488 --> 07:38.457
Please, no!
I'm easily nauseated!

07:40.626 --> 07:41.786
Look out!

07:59.979 --> 08:03.039
Start the station wagon, mom!
Start the station wagon!

08:09.388 --> 08:12.323
How was school, honey?
Did you make any new friends?

08:12.358 --> 08:16.158
There's a shake in the car, mom!
Why is there a shake in the car?

08:16.195 --> 08:18.595
What? I picked up some
Burger King for you.

08:18.631 --> 08:22.829
I hate shakes, mom!
I hate 'em! I wanted a soda.

08:22.869 --> 08:26.703
Prepare for a visit
from the Führer himself.

08:26.739 --> 08:30.835
Mein Gott!
Everything must be shpic und shpan!

08:30.877 --> 08:34.369
Hogan, will you and your men
promise to behave?

08:34.413 --> 08:37.541
You better believe it, brother!
What's Hitler gonna do...

08:37.582 --> 08:39.744
when these 24 fighters come for you?

08:39.784 --> 08:41.480
Hogan!

08:42.755 --> 08:44.620
I know nothing!

08:48.160 --> 08:50.253
OK, boys.
The big man's visit...

08:50.296 --> 08:52.787
is the perfect time
to make our escape.

08:52.832 --> 08:54.527
All right, what've we got?

08:56.302 --> 09:00.295
We have this rope and this flashlight,
the fake passports...

09:00.339 --> 09:02.830
Playboys, and these.

09:03.509 --> 09:06.910
- Yeah! Snap into a Slim Jim!
- Holy shit!

09:06.946 --> 09:10.109
Slim Jim!
I just love Slim Jims!

09:11.918 --> 09:13.351
Roddy, we need your stealth.

09:13.386 --> 09:17.447
Go take out the guard real quiet-like,
and the rest of us will sneak past...

09:17.490 --> 09:18.684
Gotcha, Hogan!

09:18.724 --> 09:22.387
Hey, you fucking Nazi! How are ya?

09:32.204 --> 09:35.264
Everything had better be
in tiptop shape.

09:35.308 --> 09:37.606
Jawohl, mein Führer!

09:37.643 --> 09:41.443
- Hulkamania, runnin' wild!
- Macho madness is comin' at you!

09:41.480 --> 09:43.641
Leaping Lanny Poffo's going baffo!

09:43.849 --> 09:45.976
- Mein schnitzel!
- Oh, no.

09:46.018 --> 09:48.885
Sergeant Slaughter's
not done with you two.

09:51.324 --> 09:53.792
And Hitler takes
a flaming chair to the spine...

09:53.826 --> 09:55.953
in what will surely
go down in history...

09:55.995 --> 09:58.361
as one of WrestleMania's
greatest moments.

09:58.397 --> 10:00.661
Sergeant Shultz,
do you have any comment?

10:00.700 --> 10:02.497
I know nothing!

10:03.305 --> 10:09.567
