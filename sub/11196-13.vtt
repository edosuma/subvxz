00:07.049 --> 00:10.636
Sir, if you don't mind,
I've got a couple of questions.

00:10.761 --> 00:12.804
Talk fast.

00:12.930 --> 00:17.059
Well, do you have any idea
how the Goa'uld escaped from the SGC?

00:17.184 --> 00:20.437
- None whatsoever.
- What weapons might we be facing?

00:20.521 --> 00:22.981
Not a clue. Anything else?

00:27.277 --> 00:31.156
Sorry, sir, I'm just...
trying to assess the situation.

00:31.281 --> 00:35.160
Two of my team were chasing a Goa'uld.
They've been missing four hours.

00:35.285 --> 00:37.538
That's the situation.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.172
This building was the last- known location
of Major Carter and Daniel Jackson.

00:48.757 --> 00:52.511
Elliot, have your team secure
the perimeter. Keep your channel open.

00:52.636 --> 00:54.680
Teal'c, you're with me.

00:54.805 --> 00:57.891
Sir! We're not going in with you?

00:59.226 --> 01:03.063
Have your team secure the perimeter.
Do you understand the order?

01:03.188 --> 01:06.024
- Yes, sir!
- Then do it, Lieutenant!

01:09.695 --> 01:12.865
Grogan, Satterfield.
Cover the other side of the building.

01:12.948 --> 01:15.409
- Yes, sir.
- Hailey.

01:15.826 --> 01:17.870
You're with me.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:27.713 --> 01:28.630
Hold position.

01:29.006 --> 01:31.842
- They're taking fire.
- Grogan, stay where you are.

01:31.967 --> 01:36.763
Backup! Elliot, get off
the channel. I say again, we need backup.

01:36.889 --> 01:39.183
OK. Move in. Move in!

02:04.583 --> 02:08.294
- Drop your weapon, Major!
- Daniel's become a Goa'uld!

02:08.419 --> 02:12.549
- She's the Goa'uld. Listen to her voice.
- Major, drop that weapon!

02:12.674 --> 02:16.053
I'm Tok'ra. Now listen carefully.
Daniel has become a Goa'uld.

02:16.178 --> 02:19.723
- We need to get him back to the SGC.
- She's already shot me once.

02:19.848 --> 02:22.851
- If she shoots me again...
- Drop it, Major! Now!

02:30.526 --> 02:33.195
Grogan. What the hell was that?

02:33.487 --> 02:37.199
She was gonna shoot Dr Jackson.
Two shots from a zat kills.

02:37.324 --> 02:40.410
That's true,
but you're wrong about one thing.

02:40.494 --> 02:43.580
She's the Tok'ra. I'm the Goa'uld.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.387
OK!

02:59.555 --> 03:01.181
So!

03:02.891 --> 03:06.854
We're all dead, and there's
an armed Goa'uld on the loose.

03:06.979 --> 03:09.356
I got a problem with that.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.694
Anybody else got a problem with that?

03:15.028 --> 03:19.324
Think it over.
Report to the ready line in 20 minutes.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.076
Dismissed.

03:25.956 --> 03:27.583
Move!

03:31.378 --> 03:34.548
Aren't you bein' a little hard on'em?

03:34.631 --> 03:38.218
- Will you turn that thing off?
- Sorry.

03:38.343 --> 03:41.263
No. I wasn't bein' too hard on'em.

04:45.452 --> 04:49.581
- You hesitated, Lieutenant.
- I was assessing the situation, sir.

04:49.706 --> 04:53.085
OK. We all ended up dead. Assess that.

04:54.044 --> 04:56.797
I stopped to argue with Grogan
and lost control.

04:56.922 --> 05:00.092
And that wasn't even your first mistake!

05:01.343 --> 05:03.387
What's your excuse?

05:03.512 --> 05:06.890
I didn't believe
Dr Jackson was the Goa'uld.

05:07.015 --> 05:10.936
- Why not, Satterfield?
- I don't know. That was just my instinct.

05:11.061 --> 05:13.438
She thinks he's cute.

05:15.691 --> 05:19.444
You let your personal feelings
for the host, in this case Dr Jackson,

05:19.570 --> 05:21.697
get in the way of what needed to be done.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.115
Yes, ma'am.

05:23.907 --> 05:27.452
- Hailey?
- I was awaiting Lieutenant Elliot's order.

05:27.578 --> 05:29.997
- To do what?
- Shoot'em both.

05:30.122 --> 05:35.043
If you don't know who's Goa'uld or Tok'ra,
disable them and sort it out later.

05:35.169 --> 05:36.795
Thank you!

05:38.213 --> 05:42.926
That was your mistake.
It's not always one or the other.

05:43.051 --> 05:45.304
I understand that, sir.

05:46.263 --> 05:49.016
May I ask how you and Teal'c
were taken out?

05:49.099 --> 05:52.352
- It was part of the scenario.
- I don't buy it, sir.

05:54.771 --> 05:56.815
- Excuse me?
- You're special- ops trained.

05:56.940 --> 06:01.236
Teal'c is a former first prime. There's no
way you'd allow yourself to be taken out.

06:01.361 --> 06:05.407
- We were taken by surprise.
- So you couldn't have called for backup.

06:05.490 --> 06:09.328
- There had to be something else.
- And that's why you hesitated?

06:09.453 --> 06:10.996
Yes, sir.

06:11.413 --> 06:16.502
OK. One of your team members distracted
you into getting shot by the enemy,

06:16.627 --> 06:19.630
and you want to poke holes
in the training scenario.

06:19.713 --> 06:20.839
It wasn't a fair test.

06:20.964 --> 06:24.635
There's such a thing as
overthinking a situation, Lieutenant.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.429
When you're dealing
with what we deal with,

06:27.513 --> 06:30.891
you've got to think on your feet,
and think fast.

06:35.854 --> 06:38.774
These... and other clichÃ©s

06:38.899 --> 06:43.111
will be available to you all
for one more day of training with me.

06:43.904 --> 06:50.077
After that... you'll either be
assigned to an SG team... or not.

06:54.623 --> 06:56.250
Dismissed.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.844
You realise he's right
about the scenario, sir.

07:06.969 --> 07:10.138
Yeah, we'll have to fix that for next time.

07:10.264 --> 07:13.433
- See you at the garage.
- Yes, sir. Good luck with them.

07:19.231 --> 07:20.858
Colonel!

07:22.025 --> 07:26.488
- Something on your mind, Lieutenant?
- I apologise for the attitude I gave you.

07:26.613 --> 07:30.492
I like people with attitude. I much
prefer them to people who suck up.

07:30.617 --> 07:33.078
That's not what I was doing, sir.

07:34.663 --> 07:38.792
You want my approval?
You're a fine officer.

07:38.876 --> 07:43.088
The Air Force has already decided that
or you wouldn't be here.

07:43.172 --> 07:46.175
But not everyone
is cut out to go off world.

07:46.300 --> 07:49.052
- I am.
- You don't decide that.

07:50.053 --> 07:55.392
What I'm trying to say, sir, is that I feel
like I've trained for this my whole life.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.978
I don't intend to let it slip by.

07:58.103 --> 08:00.355
See that you don't.

08:07.571 --> 08:11.783
Maybe he's not on our side.
Either that or he just doesn't like you.

08:12.159 --> 08:15.579
- Oh, but he loves you.
- I don't think he likes anybody.

08:15.704 --> 08:18.540
You're wrong about that.
He'd do anything for his team.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.834
- How do you know?
- I saw him in action.

08:20.959 --> 08:24.463
- He put his life on the line for us.
- Yeah. Tell us again, Hailey.

08:24.588 --> 08:27.257
May be some detail
you left out the last ten times.

08:27.341 --> 08:30.010
Hey. Nobody gets assigned to an SG team

08:30.135 --> 08:32.804
without the recommendation
of an SG team commander.

08:32.929 --> 08:37.683
It just so happened to be Colonel O'Neill's
turn, and I don't have a problem with that.

08:37.808 --> 08:39.602
Why not?

08:39.686 --> 08:43.190
It means if we get chosen,
we were chosen by the best.

08:45.067 --> 08:47.986
What happens if we don't?

08:48.111 --> 08:52.991
Then let's all decide, right here right now.
We all make it. Together.

08:57.913 --> 09:01.500
Like the man said, it's not up to us.

09:02.459 --> 09:04.920
You're wrong about that, too.

09:07.172 --> 09:10.175
I'm going for a run. Who's in?

09:10.884 --> 09:12.928
I'm in.

09:13.637 --> 09:15.681
All right.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.527
Later.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.577
Colonel. Thought you'd have
gone home for the night.

09:36.702 --> 09:39.454
I... thought about it.

09:39.538 --> 09:42.916
But I wanted to finish up
these training reports.

09:43.041 --> 09:45.210
What do you think of Lieutenant Elliot?

09:45.335 --> 09:50.215
He... thinks too much,
which makes him indecisive.

09:50.340 --> 09:53.969
He's trying to figure out what I want
instead of trusting his instincts.

09:54.094 --> 09:58.891
Or... he's very intelligent, recognises the
whole point of this training programme

09:59.016 --> 10:04.688
is to introduce non- terrestrial factors,
and he respects you more than you know.

10:05.480 --> 10:08.400
You bought his excuse for hesitating,
didn't you?

10:08.483 --> 10:11.862
Well, he was right.
You would never have let it happen.

10:11.987 --> 10:14.531
I think he was giving you
the benefit of the doubt.

10:14.656 --> 10:16.617
I think he was tap- dancing.

10:16.742 --> 10:19.661
Well, you have to admit
he's got leadership potential.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.830
Do I?

10:22.748 --> 10:26.001
Grogan. He'll make a fine addition
to an SG team one day.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.587
He'll make a fine target.

10:28.712 --> 10:31.882
- He's good at gettin' shot.
- OK. Satterfield's bright.

10:32.007 --> 10:36.762
I gave her high marks for her... high
marks. I'd never go into combat with her.

10:38.931 --> 10:43.060
- Then there's Hailey.
- Yeah. Four- foot- nine fightin' machine.

10:43.894 --> 10:45.896
- Colonel.
- All right, fine.

10:46.021 --> 10:51.527
They're the future of the Air Force,
the programme, the planet. God help us.

10:51.610 --> 10:55.989
- Try to remember being in their shoes.
- I wore boots.

10:56.073 --> 11:00.536
- Think back to when you were their age.
- I was never their age.

11:04.748 --> 11:06.542
Good night, sir.

11:07.751 --> 11:09.378
What?

11:10.629 --> 11:14.758
Inside that building
is a valuable piece of alien technology.

11:14.883 --> 11:19.680
Two things stand in your way.
Opposing fire and time.

11:20.430 --> 11:25.853
The Stargate is only open for another 12
minutes and it's a half a mile away. Clear?

11:25.936 --> 11:27.980
Yes, sir!

11:28.313 --> 11:31.650
Conduct yourselves
as though this were the real thing.

11:31.733 --> 11:36.405
The clock starts... now!
Move'em out, Lieutenant!

11:36.530 --> 11:39.199
Sir! Two by two advance! Go!

12:25.245 --> 12:27.623
Ten o'clock! Second level!

12:52.898 --> 12:56.401
- Yeah, sure, he's on our side!
- Grogan, you're with me!

12:56.527 --> 12:59.613
Hailey, Satterfield! Cover fire! Now!

13:17.047 --> 13:19.800
He broke contact.

13:19.883 --> 13:24.263
- What the hell was that?
- Colonel's got his intar on max.

13:24.346 --> 13:27.850
We've gotta keep moving.
Can you get out on your own?

13:28.433 --> 13:31.520
- Yeah, I think so.
- We've got seven minutes.

13:31.645 --> 13:35.566
We'll need three to get to the gate
at a dead run. Let's go.

13:53.834 --> 13:56.753
I'm picking up some sort of radiation.

14:01.717 --> 14:03.343
Here.

14:13.645 --> 14:16.565
All right. What do we got this time?

14:34.082 --> 14:36.585
Could be some sort of
Goa'uld power source.

14:36.710 --> 14:40.130
- Wrap it up. We don't have much time.
- Yes, sir.

14:40.255 --> 14:41.298
Whoa!

14:41.423 --> 14:43.050
- Dammit!
- What?

14:43.133 --> 14:45.177
Booby trap.

14:46.637 --> 14:49.556
- It's counting down in Goa'uld.
- How much time?

14:49.681 --> 14:52.684
- 90 seconds.
- I can try to disarm it.

14:52.809 --> 14:55.270
There's not enough time.

14:58.065 --> 15:00.984
Well, what do you want me to do?

15:24.216 --> 15:27.386
- Where is it?
- We couldn't get the device, sir.

15:27.469 --> 15:30.222
- It was booby- trapped.
- Really?

15:31.682 --> 15:33.392
Five seconds.

15:40.732 --> 15:44.361
- Did you try to disarm the device?
- Negative, sir. We only had 90 seconds.

15:44.486 --> 15:46.530
90 seconds.

15:47.698 --> 15:52.411
- Could you have disabled the device?
- I supported Lieutenant Elliot's decision.

15:52.536 --> 15:57.374
I don't care if you support him or not!
Could you have disarmed the device?

15:57.499 --> 16:01.128
- Possibly.
- I put the lives of my team members first.

16:01.420 --> 16:04.089
Really? Where's Grogan?

16:07.342 --> 16:09.511
- I ordered him to get out.
- Did you see him get out?

16:09.636 --> 16:13.223
- No, sir.
- Grogan was just killed in that explosion.

16:15.058 --> 16:18.520
- He should've been here by now.
- You left one of your team behind.

16:18.645 --> 16:22.024
That is one thing
I will not tolerate, Lieutenant!

16:29.531 --> 16:32.284
- O'Neill.
- Saved by the cell.

16:32.409 --> 16:36.205
Sorry. The colonel shot me again.
How did we do?

16:36.330 --> 16:39.958
- You were killed in the explosion.
- And I washed out.

16:40.083 --> 16:43.086
- You don't know that.
- Guys, something's going on.

16:43.170 --> 16:47.216
Sierra Golf niner.
Code Foxtrot Alpha six.

16:48.383 --> 16:51.470
- Maybe he's ordering our execution.
- Shut up.

16:54.556 --> 16:57.392
Confirm. Foothold Sierra Golf Charlie.

16:59.978 --> 17:02.564
Understood. Out.

17:07.236 --> 17:09.530
- Training's over.
- What?

17:09.655 --> 17:12.991
Training's over. Go home
until the Air Force contacts you.

17:13.116 --> 17:17.579
- Sir, I think we deserve to know...
- Dammit! What am I gonna have to do...?

17:38.767 --> 17:40.811
Wait here.

17:49.736 --> 17:53.782
- He said "Sierra Golf Charlie".
- Stargate Command.

17:58.120 --> 18:01.290
- He also said the word "foothold".
- Alien incursion.

18:06.170 --> 18:09.089
- Lieutenant.
- Everybody set their intars to maximum.

18:09.173 --> 18:11.842
- Those are our guys!
- Do it, Grogan.

18:15.053 --> 18:17.598
- We have to help him.
- Hold your position.

18:26.690 --> 18:29.359
- You're all dismissed.
- Colonel, you're injured.

18:29.443 --> 18:32.696
Stay together.
Don't trust anybody until I contact you.

18:32.821 --> 18:36.074
- You're injured. You need help.
- This is not an exercise.

18:36.200 --> 18:41.622
No, sir. It's a foothold situation. And it's
outside of the SGC. You need our help.

18:41.705 --> 18:45.292
Forgive my bluntness, Lieutenant,
but I was just about to fail you!

18:45.417 --> 18:48.795
- I'm not sure I want your help!
- I can't speak to that, sir.

18:48.921 --> 18:51.840
But at the moment we're all you've got.

18:56.428 --> 18:58.388
God help me.

19:06.188 --> 19:08.941
What's our first objective
once we make it down?

19:09.066 --> 19:11.318
- Armoury.
- Then what?

19:12.819 --> 19:17.991
Then we look for Major Carter, if she's
alive. She's the one who got the word out.

19:33.340 --> 19:36.093
What happens
if they change the access codes?

19:36.218 --> 19:38.262
Tear gas.

19:52.025 --> 19:54.570
- Clear.
- Lieutenant, take point.

19:56.864 --> 19:59.950
- Carter's lab's on sublevel 19.
- Yes, sir.

20:54.171 --> 20:59.760
- We're not authorised to use lethal force.
- I want you to have backup. Just in case.

21:07.809 --> 21:10.229
Major Carter has escaped custody.

21:10.354 --> 21:14.733
You will search sublevels 14 through 20
until she is located.

21:16.610 --> 21:20.656
Daniel Jackson. General Hammond
has been captured by my forces.

21:20.781 --> 21:26.370
And he's the last to be conformed. I've
dispatched units to locate Major Carter.

21:26.495 --> 21:29.665
She will be put to death
as you have ordered.

22:03.448 --> 22:06.451
Gather up any weapons you find
and lock them up somewhere.

22:06.535 --> 22:08.162
We could use'em.

22:08.245 --> 22:11.415
You've got enough intar rounds
to take out everybody in the mountain

22:11.498 --> 22:14.001
three times over,
plus your backup weapons.

22:14.168 --> 22:17.004
I think I found something.

22:19.882 --> 22:22.551
All right. This is a problem.

22:24.052 --> 22:27.514
- The gate's active, sir.
- Can we shut it down from here?

22:27.639 --> 22:32.019
No chance. The dialling computer's
isolated from the base mainframe.

22:32.102 --> 22:35.189
Then that's our first order of business.

22:47.493 --> 22:50.329
Looks like their leader is Dr Jackson.

22:51.163 --> 22:54.082
I always knew he wanted that office.

23:04.510 --> 23:07.596
- What is that?
- It's not our normal centrepiece.

23:08.180 --> 23:12.100
OK, so he's just possessed by something.
We gotta save him.

23:12.976 --> 23:15.562
Hailey.
Can you get me a closer view on that?

23:15.687 --> 23:17.648
I'll try.

23:23.070 --> 23:27.366
- I can't make out the writing.
- Maybe Dr Jackson took photos.

23:27.741 --> 23:31.703
Check out his office, one level up.
Grogan, make sure she gets there.

23:31.829 --> 23:34.039
- Report when you've got something.
- Yes, sir.

23:34.164 --> 23:37.167
Hailey. You and I'll shut down the gate.

23:38.877 --> 23:41.713
- Let's move out. Aagh!
- Sir.

23:42.464 --> 23:45.133
You're in no shape to do this.

23:45.801 --> 23:48.262
I've been worse.

23:48.387 --> 23:52.224
We can handle this, sir.
You're no good to us if you're dead.

24:03.735 --> 24:06.488
Stay on channel 12.

24:07.364 --> 24:09.658
This gets you anywhere in the base.

24:09.783 --> 24:13.829
Remember... those are
our people out there.

24:13.912 --> 24:17.791
- We'll get'em back, sir.
- Yeah.

24:27.593 --> 24:29.052
Damn.

24:46.195 --> 24:47.905
Oh, wrong turn!

25:26.193 --> 25:29.196
We're not here on the tour, Satterfield.

25:29.321 --> 25:30.948
Right.

25:58.684 --> 26:01.770
- I didn't have a choice.
- You did the right thing.

26:01.854 --> 26:05.440
- I've never...
- Hailey! Let's get him outta sight.

26:17.202 --> 26:18.745
I've got it.

26:18.871 --> 26:21.790
- Lieutenant, Satterfield.
- What have you got?

26:21.874 --> 26:24.543
Photos of the device
that reveal an obscure dialect

26:24.668 --> 26:29.047
SG-1 found on the planet
Argos, P3X- 8596.

26:29.131 --> 26:32.509
Rough translation: "Gift from on high. "

26:32.634 --> 26:35.721
I think we're looking at
a Goa'uld Trojan Horse.

26:35.804 --> 26:40.642
- Colonel, are you reading this?
- Yeah, I read you. That's enough chatter.

26:40.767 --> 26:45.147
The Goa'uld Pelops used nanotechnology
to rapidly age the people on Argos.

26:45.230 --> 26:49.359
- Let's get a blood sample from an SF.
- First we shut down the gate.

26:59.536 --> 27:01.163
O'Neill.

27:02.706 --> 27:04.750
Yeah. I got'em.

27:07.544 --> 27:12.090
- Elliot, get outta there! That's an order.
- Colonel, we're at the gate room.

27:12.466 --> 27:15.385
- Pull back to my position.
- Yes, sir.

27:22.809 --> 27:26.230
Oh, my God,
this blood is teeming with nanobots.

27:26.355 --> 27:29.358
The nanobots must somehow
make people responsive

27:29.483 --> 27:33.070
to the suggestions from the alien device
we saw in the briefing room.

27:33.195 --> 27:35.739
So the nanobots work together
as a receiver.

27:35.864 --> 27:39.827
Well, that's how they worked on Argos.
Right, Colonel?

27:39.952 --> 27:45.457
I was a hundred years old at the time.
The memory's the first to go.

27:45.582 --> 27:48.752
Maybe we can find out how
they communicate with the master.

27:48.836 --> 27:51.380
There are no signals being transmitted.

27:51.505 --> 27:54.174
We need to shut down
the device in the briefing room.

27:54.258 --> 27:56.677
That level's heavily guarded.

27:56.802 --> 27:59.972
We still need to
get control of the Stargate.

28:02.307 --> 28:05.310
If we take out the briefing room,
you'll have a better chance

28:05.435 --> 28:08.981
to get into the gate room
and lock out the dialling computer.

28:09.106 --> 28:11.358
That's the plan, then.

28:11.483 --> 28:13.694
Take corridor C- 19.

28:13.819 --> 28:15.445
Sir.

28:40.512 --> 28:42.848
They're on their way.

28:57.446 --> 28:59.490
Major Carter.

29:02.743 --> 29:06.163
- What are you doing here?
- Just helping out, ma'am.

29:06.288 --> 29:10.584
- Check the major for weapons.
- She was captured. We can't trust her.

29:10.709 --> 29:13.295
I escaped. Where's Colonel O'Neill?

29:13.420 --> 29:16.089
We'll take you to him.

29:16.965 --> 29:18.842
She's clear.

29:18.926 --> 29:20.969
This way, please.

29:33.982 --> 29:35.609
Colonel.

29:36.360 --> 29:40.280
- I was about to interrogate the prisoner.
- No! You weren't.

29:43.033 --> 29:46.119
Step away from the prisoner,
please, Colonel.

29:50.499 --> 29:53.418
Colonel O'Neill's been compromised.
I'll take it from here.

29:53.544 --> 29:57.589
Lieutenant, you've only been gone
for two minutes. There's no way that...

29:57.714 --> 30:00.467
- You saw what he was doing.
- Why'd you pull us out?

30:00.551 --> 30:03.804
- It was an ambush. A trap.
- I don't buy it, sir.

30:03.887 --> 30:06.974
Look... I am your commanding officer.

30:11.019 --> 30:15.649
Return Satterfield's weapon,
please, Major. We've got a job to do.

30:19.111 --> 30:22.531
- How did you know to trust me?
- Hailey figured the Goa'uld markers

30:22.656 --> 30:27.202
in your blood wouldn't allow you to be
influenced by Goa'uld nanotechnology.

30:27.327 --> 30:29.037
Lucky me.

30:29.163 --> 30:32.958
- Yes, ma'am.
- I need to stay here to work on a cure.

30:33.083 --> 30:35.836
- Can you take out the device alone?
- Yes, ma'am.

30:35.961 --> 30:39.464
- You'll also need to...
- Shut down the Stargate. Yes, ma'am.

30:39.590 --> 30:42.676
- We're on it.
- Good luck, Lieutenant.

30:54.646 --> 30:56.106
Whoops.

31:08.744 --> 31:11.330
- Everybody clear on your assignments?
- Yeah.

31:11.455 --> 31:14.458
Grogan.
Just make sure you take out Daniel.

31:14.541 --> 31:16.585
It's done.

31:32.851 --> 31:35.854
"Colonel O'Neill
has been compromised?"

31:35.938 --> 31:39.274
Well, they didn't take corridor C- 19
like you told them to.

31:39.358 --> 31:41.068
Crafty little buggers!

31:41.193 --> 31:44.112
- At least we pulled it off.
- Yeah.

31:44.238 --> 31:45.864
Ow!

31:47.282 --> 31:50.536
You did order them to set their
training weapons to maximum stun.

31:50.661 --> 31:56.333
Yes, I did. But it was only because
Daniel's had it so easy on this one.

31:56.416 --> 31:57.876
Is everybody upstairs?

31:57.960 --> 32:03.215
General Hammond and the Pentagon staff
are monitoring from the security office.

32:04.842 --> 32:09.221
Sir, if you don't mind,
your wound is getting all over my lab.

32:10.138 --> 32:11.765
Sorry.

32:13.392 --> 32:15.686
Same wager as last time, George?

32:15.811 --> 32:19.857
That's hardly fair.
These young people are against SG-1.

32:19.940 --> 32:24.319
- I'll give you double or nothing.
- Well, in that case, how can I refuse?

32:24.444 --> 32:26.488
You never could.

32:27.573 --> 32:32.661
So how's the pilot training programme
so far? The latest graduates working out?

32:32.786 --> 32:36.165
We believe they are faring better
than new team members in the past.

32:36.290 --> 32:40.252
Makes sense. Up to now we've only
trained people to defend this country.

32:40.377 --> 32:44.131
- Now that we're defending the planet...
- That's exactly right.

32:44.256 --> 32:48.802
In fact, in next year's SGC budget I am
proposing an offworld training facility.

32:48.927 --> 32:53.599
It must drive everyone crazy tying up
several floors to run these scenarios.

32:53.724 --> 32:56.560
My people are happy to cooperate.

32:59.396 --> 33:04.401
- Elliot certainly seems confident.
- Top of his class in the Academy.

33:04.526 --> 33:09.072
You should've seen him when I told him
about the training he'd been picked for.

33:09.156 --> 33:11.116
I can imagine.

33:11.241 --> 33:15.537
They should be emerging
from the access shaft on sublevel 27.

33:15.621 --> 33:20.083
Looks like they've split up, George.
Grogan just came out on sublevel 26.

33:20.209 --> 33:24.671
Apparently Lieutenant Elliot is planning
on assaulting the briefing room

33:24.796 --> 33:27.883
from several points of access.

33:27.966 --> 33:30.177
General. Generals.

33:31.136 --> 33:35.015
- What do you think of their strategy?
- It's hard to say.

33:35.140 --> 33:38.602
- I think he knows it's a test.
- How's that?

33:38.727 --> 33:42.689
I pulled him out of the gate room
just as SG- 3 was coming back.

33:42.814 --> 33:46.360
What's with those marines? Don't they
know we've got a scenario here?

33:46.485 --> 33:49.154
They were under heavy fire
from a Goa'uld.

33:49.279 --> 33:53.075
Well, if he knows it's an exercise,
he won't show it.

33:53.200 --> 33:56.036
However, he did appear
to enjoy shooting me.

33:56.161 --> 34:00.541
In light of SG- 3's emergency,
maybe we should call off the exercise.

34:00.666 --> 34:02.876
I don't think so. They all made it back.

34:03.001 --> 34:07.214
And besides, Elliot's team's almost ready
to launch their attack on Dr Jackson.

34:09.632 --> 34:14.012
I like this scenario way better than
the last one. Have you tried this chair?

34:14.096 --> 34:17.850
- This is, like, really comfortable.
- Indeed I have not.

34:20.811 --> 34:23.897
- Hello?
- Have fun, Daniel.

34:24.481 --> 34:28.944
You did tell them to take me prisoner
this time and not shoot me, right?

34:29.027 --> 34:30.654
Right?

34:35.324 --> 34:37.034
Hello?

35:07.065 --> 35:09.109
Dr Jackson?

35:13.572 --> 35:15.616
I'm so sorry.

35:17.743 --> 35:20.913
- Rig the charge. I'll get Grogan out.
- Got it.

35:24.082 --> 35:26.335
Come on. Let's go.

35:29.546 --> 35:32.007
That hurt a little.

35:32.132 --> 35:34.593
- Did we pull it off?
- Almost.

35:43.644 --> 35:45.687
15 seconds.

35:50.567 --> 35:52.194
Satterfield!

35:58.325 --> 35:59.785
Four.

36:12.297 --> 36:15.300
- Did you...?
- I set it. Something's wrong.

36:27.855 --> 36:31.108
Modelling clay doesn't pack
much of a punch, does it?

36:31.275 --> 36:34.528
We've been watching your every move
since your arrival.

36:34.653 --> 36:37.322
- Welcome to Stargate Command.
- Yes, sir.

36:39.158 --> 36:43.203
You may have noticed I lied a little bit
about the foothold situation.

36:43.871 --> 36:46.331
- But you were shot.
- So it appeared.

36:49.626 --> 36:53.505
- Hailey killed an SF.
- The SFs were using blank cartridges.

36:53.630 --> 36:55.716
Same as your backup weapons.

36:55.841 --> 36:59.803
You staged the whole thing when you
shot that general at the training complex?

36:59.928 --> 37:02.222
- Yep.
- It was important for us to know

37:02.347 --> 37:07.311
how you'd react in a real- life situation
before you encountered one off world.

37:08.061 --> 37:11.565
- You weren't... a little bit suspicious?
- No, sir.

37:13.483 --> 37:16.737
- How did we do?
- The entire exercise was recorded,

37:16.862 --> 37:20.991
and will be properly reviewed
before making a final assessment.

37:21.116 --> 37:23.869
But I'm sure you did very well.

37:24.369 --> 37:26.413
We kicked ass!

37:27.498 --> 37:31.543
You got yourself shot again, Grogan.
Don't be so cocky.

37:32.628 --> 37:35.714
Yeah, thanks for the rescue, by the way.

37:36.381 --> 37:38.634
Where's Lieutenant Hailey?

37:39.468 --> 37:41.512
Hailey, report.

37:43.263 --> 37:44.890
Hailey.

37:46.141 --> 37:48.185
She must still be in the gate room.

37:48.310 --> 37:51.230
Unscheduled offworld activation.

37:57.277 --> 37:59.738
Hailey, evacuate the gate room!

38:27.266 --> 38:30.102
Sir, I can't close the iris.

38:32.813 --> 38:35.357
There's radiation
coming through the Stargate.

38:35.482 --> 38:38.735
Sir, you have to order
an evacuation of this level.

38:38.819 --> 38:42.656
This is Hammond. All personnel
evacuate level 28 immediately.

38:42.781 --> 38:45.784
This is not a drill.
I repeat, this is not a drill.

38:45.868 --> 38:48.120
What about Hailey?

38:50.622 --> 38:52.875
She's already dead.

39:05.929 --> 39:08.473
What kinda radiation are we talkin' about?

39:08.599 --> 39:12.728
Gamma. Probably from the Goa'uld
that SG- 3 just barely got away from.

39:12.811 --> 39:16.481
I'd like to know why in God's name
we were unable to close the iris.

39:16.607 --> 39:20.652
In the test scenario, Lieutenant Hailey
was trying to shut down gate control.

39:20.777 --> 39:23.197
She must've taken our controls offline.

39:23.322 --> 39:26.408
- She's very smart, sir.
- Apparently.

39:26.533 --> 39:31.872
- We should head up to the security office.
- We'll monitor the gate room from there.

39:39.630 --> 39:43.425
I never thought she'd get around our
codes, and then we came under attack.

39:43.550 --> 39:45.928
- It's a worst- case scenario.
- What are our options?

39:46.053 --> 39:51.558
The only way is to manually close the iris.
At these radiation levels it'd be suicide.

40:01.151 --> 40:03.904
- Major?
- My access card, sir.

40:23.590 --> 40:25.634
There he is.

40:29.346 --> 40:32.349
Elliot, this is General Hammond.
If you enter that gate room,

40:32.474 --> 40:35.477
you're going to be killed
by radiation poisoning.

40:35.561 --> 40:37.938
Now, I'm ordering you...

41:04.089 --> 41:07.801
- He's gonna get it closed.
- That much radiation...

41:07.926 --> 41:10.596
He's already dead, isn't he?

41:22.149 --> 41:25.319
Hailey's still alive!
We need a medical team down here!

41:25.444 --> 41:28.363
I say again, Hailey needs help in here!

41:39.917 --> 41:42.586
You've gotta be kidding me!

41:44.671 --> 41:49.843
- You can put me down now, hero.
- You were in on it.

41:49.968 --> 41:55.224
How do you think I was able to show you
nanobots if they didn't really exist?

41:55.349 --> 41:56.892
I'm gonna kill you.

41:56.975 --> 41:59.895
You should've seen
what they put me through.

42:06.360 --> 42:10.197
SG teams require the commitment to go
above and beyond the call of duty.

42:10.322 --> 42:13.492
- You've just demonstrated that.
- Yes, sir!

42:13.575 --> 42:17.120
After a few days' rest,
you're to report back to the SGC,

42:17.246 --> 42:21.208
where you will be assigned to SG-17
under Major Mansfield.

42:21.333 --> 42:25.796
- If you think I was tough on you...
- What about the rest of the team?

42:25.879 --> 42:30.008
They will be assigned to SG teams
as positions become available.

42:30.133 --> 42:32.970
But the first assignment is yours.

42:33.095 --> 42:35.764
- Yes, sir.
- Congratulations, son.

42:39.852 --> 42:41.895
Good job.

42:42.020 --> 42:45.649
Hey! You knew it was a test
when you shot me, right?

42:45.774 --> 42:48.944
Well... maybe suspected.

42:49.027 --> 42:51.446
And you really think the test is over now?

43:15.429 --> 43:18.182
