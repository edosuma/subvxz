6a-47. We are code 6
at the prowler complaint.

00:40.082 --> 00:42.583
Sync: Kiry, ShalimarFox

00:49.359 --> 00:51.842
Merch, around back! He's running!

00:54.497 --> 00:57.306
47 requesting assistance.
We are in foot pursuit.

00:57.474 --> 01:00.701
Subject is white, male,
wearing dark clothing.

01:00.826 --> 01:04.830
I need a perimeter set up and be advised
we have not cleared the house.

01:43.093 --> 01:46.849
6a-32 requesting paramedics.
We've got a woman down in the house.

01:46.974 --> 01:48.024
She's gone.

02:13.978 --> 02:15.428
Evening, gentlemen.

02:16.011 --> 02:17.479
Have we been in the house yet?

02:17.604 --> 02:20.295
No, the dog handlers don't want
to contaminate the crime scene

02:20.420 --> 02:21.926
before the k-9 search is complete.

02:22.051 --> 02:25.560
So in the meantime, we got Tao
and Sanchez knocking on doors.

02:25.685 --> 02:28.227
Flynn wrote up a search warrant.
We found a judge a few blocks away

02:28.352 --> 02:30.023
- that will sign it.
- That's lucky.

02:30.191 --> 02:33.133
- What happened?
- The neighbor over there...

02:33.258 --> 02:35.660
called in a prowler
around 10:30 this evening.

02:35.785 --> 02:37.578
Responding officers knock one time,

02:37.703 --> 02:39.783
see the suspect run
from the back of the house.

02:39.951 --> 02:41.936
They call it in, set up a perimeter.

02:42.061 --> 02:44.377
Additional unit arrives,
enters through the back of the house

02:44.502 --> 02:46.564
to search and clear it,
finds the body inside.

02:46.689 --> 02:49.264
Paramedics pronounced
her dead 10 minutes ago.

02:49.389 --> 02:50.576
Who is she?

02:51.984 --> 02:52.880
Jessica...

02:53.336 --> 02:56.896
Jessica something. She only moved in
a couple of months ago.

02:57.021 --> 03:00.387
She seemed like a real nice
young woman. We kept meaning to...

03:00.839 --> 03:02.389
ask her over for dinner.

03:06.478 --> 03:10.230
<i>All units, stand by. We have
an alert at the back of 632 Devon.</i>

03:14.202 --> 03:15.819
Hands! Show me your hands!

03:18.490 --> 03:20.468
Get down on the ground now!

03:45.315 --> 03:49.319
S.I.D.'s got a 15-minute E.T.A.
Watch out for the popcorn there, Chief.

03:50.823 --> 03:53.730
So, it looks like
she was on her laptop,

03:54.275 --> 03:57.525
probably heard a sound,
put the TV on pause to listen.

03:57.650 --> 04:01.001
Then she saw her intruder
and bolted from the couch.

04:01.149 --> 04:03.514
He grabs her here. Now,
she's in pretty good shape,

04:03.639 --> 04:07.329
so she puts up some kind of a struggle
and then tries to escape.

04:07.497 --> 04:10.082
So he grabs her hair
at the back of her head...

04:10.250 --> 04:11.583
So she was running away.

04:11.876 --> 04:14.086
Right, and then flung her around

04:14.254 --> 04:17.603
onto the coffee table,
giving her that gash on her head.

04:17.860 --> 04:18.860
Then...

04:19.951 --> 04:23.095
- pins her down and...
- Tore off her underwear. Yes, I see.

04:25.574 --> 04:26.431
The...

04:27.160 --> 04:31.138
officers who found her said that they
found that pillow there on her face,

04:31.263 --> 04:32.713
like she had been smothered.

04:32.838 --> 04:36.638
Probably used it to keep her quiet
when they knocked on the door.

04:38.349 --> 04:39.849
Then why did he run?

05:12.360 --> 05:14.896
She was updating her web
page, Chief. Check it out.

05:15.064 --> 05:17.114
It's the last thing she wrote.

05:18.638 --> 05:21.152
"Missed home today,
but I'm better now."

05:21.277 --> 05:24.322
"Unpacked some pictures,
put them out. Feels good."

05:24.905 --> 05:28.027
"Gonna be strange celebrating without
mom's strawberry cake tomorrow,"

05:28.152 --> 05:29.661
"but I like it here."

05:29.829 --> 05:32.079
"And only two more weeks until... "

05:32.999 --> 05:34.799
Two more weeks until what?

05:35.065 --> 05:38.765
Two weeks till her fiancé joins her.
It's in her birthday card.

05:40.428 --> 05:43.205
"Jess, started packing my things."

05:43.478 --> 05:46.417
"Can't wait for the move.
Miss you. So proud."

05:47.360 --> 05:49.360
"Happy birthday.
Love, Pete."

05:50.782 --> 05:53.871
"P. S. Sally wants
her tummy scratched."

05:56.098 --> 05:57.798
Sally must be their dog.

06:00.479 --> 06:03.803
Her name's Jessica Goodall.
She's from Joplin, Missouri.

06:03.928 --> 06:06.156
And tomorrow
she was going to turn 30.

06:14.108 --> 06:16.546
Did someone open this door?
It's unlocked.

06:16.671 --> 06:20.420
Well, we all came in the back.
Maybe Jessica forgot to lock it.

06:20.588 --> 06:24.090
A woman who just moved {\(here)}from Missouri
does not forget to lock her door{\(at night)}.

06:24.630 --> 06:27.004
Maybe she opened it
for her attacker.

06:27.129 --> 06:29.179
- Chief, I found the point of entry!
- Or not.

06:29.347 --> 06:31.261
You know what?
I'm tired of these slip-ups.

06:31.386 --> 06:34.365
Whether it's the coroner, the paramedics
or one of our officers open a door

06:34.490 --> 06:37.882
before we've had a chance to document
the scene and you've let in the defense.

06:38.007 --> 06:42.011
Sgt Gabriel, please find out who came
through here, and quickly. Thank you.

06:44.764 --> 06:45.914
You see this?

06:46.280 --> 06:49.804
He cut the screen around
the edge from right to left,

06:50.409 --> 06:53.704
nice and square, and he
climbed in over that counter.

06:54.456 --> 06:58.206
- She must have left it unlocked.
- I find that hard to swallow.

06:58.451 --> 07:01.444
But even if she hadn't locked the window
how would our intruder know that?

07:01.569 --> 07:03.463
You can't see the lock from outside.

07:03.932 --> 07:07.832
Chief, they're bringing the suspect
out front for the field showup.

07:09.046 --> 07:10.046
Thank you.

07:10.475 --> 07:14.275
"This person is in temporary custody
as a possible suspect only."

07:14.764 --> 07:18.319
"And the factthat he is in custody
does not indicate guilt,"

07:18.975 --> 07:22.175
even though he looks like hell
from hiding in a tree.

07:25.604 --> 07:28.902
"The purposeof the confrontation
is either to eliminate

07:29.027 --> 07:31.327
or identify him as the perpetrator."

07:31.534 --> 07:33.184
- Chief.
- Lieutenant.

07:34.286 --> 07:35.686
Let's go. Come on.

07:38.441 --> 07:39.541
Mr. Evans...

07:42.883 --> 07:45.845
is this the man you saw approaching
your neighbor's house?

07:45.970 --> 07:47.170
Well...

07:48.414 --> 07:49.384
yeah.

07:50.956 --> 07:52.156
Yeah, I guess.

07:52.610 --> 07:54.160
He seemed a little...

07:55.072 --> 07:58.386
a little taller. I wasn't
wearing my glasses.

07:58.700 --> 08:00.826
My wife was there, and she saw him.

08:00.951 --> 08:03.106
Maybe we should be
talking to your wife, then.

08:03.385 --> 08:07.321
Well, she's gone to work already.
She's a nurse on the night shift.

08:07.446 --> 08:09.028
All right. Thank you. Lieutenant.

08:09.196 --> 08:11.246
Thank you, sir. Right this way.

08:11.371 --> 08:13.455
Lt Provenza, please
arrange to have a lineup

08:13.580 --> 08:15.880
with Mrs. Evans as soon as possible.

08:19.773 --> 08:20.873
Who are you?

08:27.235 --> 08:28.985
His name is Chris Dunlap.

08:31.385 --> 08:35.346
He's 27, he lives in Burbank... at least
according to his driver's license.

08:35.514 --> 08:38.265
That's all we have to go on,
'cause he hasn't said a word.

08:38.433 --> 08:41.144
Well, I just read
the little cretin his rights.

08:41.312 --> 08:44.397
I ran his name. Dunlap was
arrested two years ago

08:44.565 --> 08:47.848
for exposing himself to an 8-year-old
girl in a public restroom

08:47.973 --> 08:50.056
and then arrested again
nine months ago

08:50.181 --> 08:53.419
for molesting his cousin's 13-year-old
daughter while she took a shower.

08:53.544 --> 08:57.422
- Wasn't convicted on either charge.
- Yeah, well, then, he must be innocent.

08:57.547 --> 09:00.459
Sorry, Chief. This took a little longer
than I thought, but I went ahead

09:00.584 --> 09:02.187
and enlarged a map

09:02.312 --> 09:05.199
of the 3-square-mile
area around the victim.

09:05.324 --> 09:07.587
In the last 6 months,
there's been 7 other rapes.

09:07.712 --> 09:09.762
2 occurred in the last 20 days.

09:09.887 --> 09:12.444
Of those 7,
6 match your point of entry

09:12.569 --> 09:14.306
through an unlocked bathroom window.

09:14.431 --> 09:17.002
Screen's cut right to left,
just like this one.

09:17.127 --> 09:20.227
All the vics blond,
in their 20s, and living alone.

09:21.071 --> 09:23.315
All right, cdr Taylor,
would you please pull those files

09:23.440 --> 09:25.284
and see what physical evidence
was collected?

09:25.409 --> 09:27.876
Lt Tao, let's run a credit report
on Mr. Dunlap.

09:28.001 --> 09:31.494
Let's see if we can wrap this up
tonight. Thank you.

09:37.042 --> 09:38.042
Hi, Chris.

09:38.744 --> 09:41.194
I'm deputy chief
Brenda Leigh Johnson.

09:42.279 --> 09:45.879
It looks like you got pretty
scratched up climbing that tree.

09:46.004 --> 09:48.399
I'd like to have somebody
come take a look at you,

09:48.524 --> 09:50.324
but first we need to talk.

09:53.847 --> 09:56.770
Chris, something really
terrible happened tonight.

09:56.895 --> 10:00.306
And I want you to know
that I don't think it was intentional.

10:00.474 --> 10:04.478
In fact, I'm certain what happened to
that poor young woman was an accident.

10:07.569 --> 10:09.119
Her name was Jessica.

10:11.792 --> 10:15.668
She just moved here from Missouri.
She was looking forward to her fiancé

10:15.793 --> 10:18.443
joining her in a few weeks
with their dog.

10:19.576 --> 10:22.725
Today was her birthday.
She was gonna be 30 years old.

10:22.850 --> 10:24.420
And now she's not.

10:26.470 --> 10:28.520
I need to know how you met her.

10:30.864 --> 10:32.250
Chris, listen to me.

10:32.375 --> 10:34.790
I have a witness
who will identify you

10:34.915 --> 10:36.926
as the person she saw
in Jessica's house.

10:37.217 --> 10:40.147
Minutes later, you were seen running
from that house by a police officer.

10:40.272 --> 10:42.590
Put that together with our dogs
who are never wrong

10:42.715 --> 10:44.850
finding you in a tree
three blocks away,

10:45.018 --> 10:48.713
and people are gonna start jumping
to all sorts of conclusions.

10:48.838 --> 10:51.317
Now, if you have an explanation
for what happened tonight,

10:51.442 --> 10:54.392
- I need you to tell me.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

10:54.517 --> 10:57.867
Okay, what? About what, Chris?
What are you sorry about?

11:01.868 --> 11:05.518
- Detective why are you interrupting me?
- His lawyer's here.

11:08.625 --> 11:10.675
You already called your lawyer?

11:21.087 --> 11:22.887
You must be chief Johnson.

11:23.275 --> 11:25.349
Phillip Stroh. Pleasure to meet you.

11:26.008 --> 11:29.408
Your client has your number
on his speed dial, Mr. Stroh?

11:29.782 --> 11:31.782
I've represented Chris before.

11:32.345 --> 11:34.045
- Just this way?
- Yes.

11:38.405 --> 11:40.808
Last number dialed... 11:47 P.M.

11:41.324 --> 11:45.328
Son of a bitch called his attorney
when the dogs had him up in the tree.

11:47.247 --> 11:49.147
What is the world coming to?

12:00.552 --> 12:01.552
Chief.

12:02.126 --> 12:05.114
I just spoke to the nurse. She's
on her way in for the lineup.

12:05.239 --> 12:08.485
- Scrambled egg whites and turkey bacon.
- Thank you, Buzz.

12:08.610 --> 12:11.258
I went over Chris' financials.
He's got no current credit cards,

12:11.383 --> 12:13.689
no loans, no leases,
no bank accounts,

12:13.858 --> 12:14.846
no job.

12:15.286 --> 12:18.636
Other than his cellphone,
he's practically off the grid.

12:19.529 --> 12:21.041
Yeah? Thanks, Buzz.

12:21.166 --> 12:23.666
Speaking of his cellphone,
I dumped it.

12:24.510 --> 12:27.617
The little creep hardly uses the thing.
I mean, other than the call...

12:27.742 --> 12:30.644
that he made to his attorney
last night, from up in the tree,

12:30.769 --> 12:34.589
there's a few calls to a delivery
company, a few more to a temp agency,

12:34.714 --> 12:37.062
and then there's a whole bunch
to an address in Burbank,

12:37.187 --> 12:38.876
which happens to be
his mother's house.

12:39.001 --> 12:41.119
If he didn't have a job
and he didn't have any money,

12:41.244 --> 12:44.194
- what was he having delivered?
- I'll find out.

12:44.512 --> 12:46.191
Prelim from the autopsy confirms

12:46.316 --> 12:48.682
that Jessica Goodall was not
sexually assaulted.

12:48.850 --> 12:52.222
That's because the cops knocked on the
door. The bastard didn't have the time.

12:52.347 --> 12:54.855
Also, Dr. Morales...
he cut her nails,

12:55.023 --> 12:57.194
put them under the scope,
didn't find any skin fragments,

12:57.319 --> 12:59.588
- so she didn't scratch the guy.
- What about prints?

12:59.713 --> 13:02.069
They lifted 37
from inside the location.

13:02.194 --> 13:04.944
They're trying to exclude Jessica's now.
We should know more soon{\(by the end of the day}.

13:05.069 --> 13:08.804
Also I spoke to the coroner's assistant.
Swears he never used the front door,

13:08.929 --> 13:11.145
that he came around back
like everyone else.

13:11.270 --> 13:14.320
- Still tracking down the paramedics.
- Excuse me.

13:15.048 --> 13:16.892
Mr. Stroh, what are you
doing in here?

13:17.017 --> 13:19.216
- Sorry. Looking for vending machines.
- If you're hungry,

13:19.341 --> 13:20.962
{\(you can}take the elevator to the 1st floor.

13:21.087 --> 13:23.767
Public vending machines are the
same place they've always been.

13:23.892 --> 13:26.295
Yeah, and you can't just go
wandering around these halls.

13:26.420 --> 13:27.470
My mistake.

13:28.647 --> 13:32.651
You know, that's the same lawyer
that got Chris' other charges dropped.

13:33.356 --> 13:34.478
Morning, Chief.

13:36.025 --> 13:40.029
I've been combing through the files of
the six previous rapes, like you asked.

13:41.096 --> 13:43.306
They're getting more violent
and more frequent.

13:43.431 --> 13:44.863
The girl he raped before this,

13:45.031 --> 13:47.282
he tied to a bedpost,
then he knocked her around.

13:47.450 --> 13:51.174
- What about physical evidence?
- No prints, no DNA, anywhere.

13:51.299 --> 13:55.199
- How did he manage that, I wonder?
- He must have worn a raincoat.

13:57.375 --> 14:00.352
Hey, Chief, get this. You know
the company that Chris was calling?

14:00.477 --> 14:02.798
He wasn't expecting any deliveries.
He works there.

14:02.966 --> 14:04.416
He's a deliveryman.

14:05.385 --> 14:07.493
Excuse me, Chief.
Mr and Mrs Evans are here.

14:07.618 --> 14:10.806
- I set them up in the electronics room.
- Thank you, Buzz. We'll be right there.

14:11.011 --> 14:13.843
Lieutenant, would you please get
the delivery logs for these companies?

14:13.968 --> 14:16.607
If Chris Dunlap was anywhere
in the vicinity of any of these women,

14:16.732 --> 14:18.932
I want to know about it. Sergeant.

14:24.590 --> 14:26.490
Chris, ready for the lineup?

14:33.449 --> 14:35.149
Just step down the hall.

14:35.945 --> 14:36.865
Thanks.

14:36.990 --> 14:39.961
Mr. Stroh, I'm sure you know
how these things go.

14:40.086 --> 14:43.142
I'm gonna introduce you to the witness,
but you're not to ask her any questions.

14:43.267 --> 14:45.523
- Is that clear?
- I know the process, Chief.

14:45.648 --> 14:48.648
Hey, Mr. Stroh... Phil.
I'm just curious.

14:48.773 --> 14:52.097
You defended Chris for molesting
a 13-year-old family member,

14:52.265 --> 14:56.017
and you got the charges dismissed.
And now looks like the same guy

14:56.185 --> 14:57.735
has murdered someone.

14:57.981 --> 14:59.792
- How do you feel about that?
- Well,

14:59.917 --> 15:03.049
first of all, it doesn't look like Chris
murdered this young lady to me.

15:03.174 --> 15:05.764
And if you're asking
about his previous case,

15:05.889 --> 15:08.785
obviously, the State couldn't
prove their allegations. So...

15:08.910 --> 15:10.573
if you have a problem
with the legal...

15:10.698 --> 15:12.951
No, I don't think the sergeant
was talking about specifics,

15:13.119 --> 15:14.919
just about how you as a...

15:15.523 --> 15:18.373
human being justify
defending child molesters.

15:19.533 --> 15:20.533
All right.

15:20.960 --> 15:24.022
Most criminals... they do their time,
and when they get out of prison,

15:24.147 --> 15:26.747
they go on about their lives
anonymously.

15:27.046 --> 15:30.135
Sex offenders are registered
until the day they die.

15:30.681 --> 15:33.388
They're branded... like animals.

15:34.930 --> 15:38.087
Now, if the State is going to punish
them more harshly than other criminals,

15:38.212 --> 15:40.312
it also assumes a special burden

15:40.437 --> 15:43.685
to prove their continuing threat
to society. It's my job...

15:43.810 --> 15:46.760
to make sure the state
demonstrates that threat.

15:46.885 --> 15:48.612
So, Sergeant...

15:49.487 --> 15:53.063
if your charmingly phrased accusation
really does have something to do

15:53.188 --> 15:56.588
with how defending suspected
sex offenders makes me feel,

15:56.835 --> 15:58.135
the answer is...

15:59.883 --> 16:01.583
it gives purpose to my life.

16:03.628 --> 16:04.628
Now,

16:04.885 --> 16:07.726
I'd like to hear
what your eyewitness has to say.

16:07.851 --> 16:09.001
Wouldn't you?

16:10.267 --> 16:11.317
Absolutely.

16:11.798 --> 16:15.680
Lt Provenza, would you please
escort Mr. Evans out? Thank you.

16:17.749 --> 16:20.285
Hello, Mrs. Evans. I'm
deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.

16:20.410 --> 16:22.510
Thank you so much for coming in.

16:22.663 --> 16:24.856
This is Mr. Stroh. He's an attorney.

16:25.265 --> 16:27.565
- Yes. How do you do?
- Mrs. Evans.

16:31.498 --> 16:33.990
Any problem with the selection,
Mr. Stroh?

16:34.376 --> 16:35.634
No, looks fine to me.

16:35.759 --> 16:37.702
All right, then, Mrs. Evans,
you take your time.

16:37.870 --> 16:41.539
Let us know if there's anyone here
that you recognize from last night.

16:47.129 --> 16:48.779
<i>Number 1, step forward.</i>

16:49.622 --> 16:51.022
<i>Turn to the right.</i>

16:51.651 --> 16:52.651
<i>Again.</i>

16:53.252 --> 16:54.252
<i>Again.</i>

16:54.555 --> 16:56.155
<i>Step back to the wall.</i>

16:57.197 --> 16:58.768
<i>Number 2, step forward.</i>

16:58.893 --> 16:59.893
No.

17:02.705 --> 17:04.020
<i>Turn to the right.</i>

17:04.441 --> 17:05.441
<i>Again.</i>

17:05.566 --> 17:08.733
I remember he was slim
and he had dark clothes.

17:09.294 --> 17:13.144
But he had a t-shirt underneath.
I remember the white at his neck.

17:14.467 --> 17:15.483
<i>Number 3...</i>

17:15.608 --> 17:17.583
No. No, he wasn't hispanic.

17:17.708 --> 17:19.108
<i>Turn to the right.</i>

17:19.913 --> 17:22.570
<i>If you have a phone, take it out.</i>

17:25.003 --> 17:26.104
<i>Turn it off.</i>

17:27.259 --> 17:28.358
<i>Put it back.</i>

17:28.941 --> 17:30.591
<i>Number 4, step forward.</i>

17:32.911 --> 17:34.361
<i>Turn to your right.</i>

17:36.929 --> 17:39.143
<i>Again... Again.</i>

17:40.373 --> 17:42.673
- Back to the wall.
- I don't know.

17:43.618 --> 17:47.609
He was tall like number 5
but not as large.

17:48.266 --> 17:51.116
- I'm 6'2". Was he closer to my height?
- Hey!

17:51.684 --> 17:52.684
Quiet.

17:54.848 --> 17:56.598
Chief, can I talk to you?

17:57.091 --> 17:59.242
Yes. Sgt Gabriel, would you please

17:59.410 --> 18:02.660
take Mr. Stroh to interview 1
when we're through here?

18:02.952 --> 18:05.456
Mrs. Evans, thank you
so much for your help.

18:08.551 --> 18:11.706
Okay, Chris made deliveries
to every single one of these victims

18:11.831 --> 18:13.839
days before they were attacked.

18:14.007 --> 18:17.607
That's how come he knew their
bathroom windows were unlocked.

18:18.959 --> 18:20.709
He unlocked them himself.

18:21.666 --> 18:22.473
Four.

18:25.974 --> 18:26.974
Six.

18:32.658 --> 18:36.558
Sgt Gabriel, would you please keep
Mr. Dunlap company for a moment?

18:37.701 --> 18:39.851
Mr. Stroh, I need to talk to you.

18:41.577 --> 18:43.377
I'm arresting your client.

18:43.502 --> 18:45.202
For what... trespassing?

18:45.327 --> 18:48.817
Chris Dunlap works as a deliveryman,
Mr. Stroh. Are you aware of that?

18:48.942 --> 18:51.412
You said that the State
has a special burden of proof

18:51.537 --> 18:54.255
when it comes to sex-crime cases.
Well, here it is...

18:54.423 --> 18:57.216
Your client was in Jessica Goodall's
house delivering a dishwasher

18:57.539 --> 18:58.996
4 days before she was murdered.

18:59.121 --> 19:01.465
He delivered a mattress
to Lauren Clark

19:01.590 --> 19:04.591
three days before she was tied
to her bed and brutally raped.

19:04.716 --> 19:07.256
He delivered a refrigerator
to Rebecca Howl 5 days...

19:07.381 --> 19:10.294
- circumstantial.
- Six rapes and one murder,

19:10.610 --> 19:12.320
all at the same point of entry...

19:12.445 --> 19:16.185
a bathroom window your client opened
when he made these deliveries.

19:16.310 --> 19:19.910
Take this to a jury, and your
client faces the death penalty.

19:20.620 --> 19:22.220
I want to make a deal.

19:23.744 --> 19:25.390
You want to make a deal?

19:25.515 --> 19:27.602
Well, just to satisfy
my curiosity, Mr. Stroh,

19:27.727 --> 19:29.821
what kind of deal
would you like to make?

19:29.946 --> 19:32.228
I don't know.
You get the D.A. to agree,

19:32.353 --> 19:33.853
and Chris will do...

19:34.435 --> 19:36.714
- 8 years.
- What could you possibly give me

19:36.839 --> 19:39.955
that would merit reducing
your client's sentence to 8 years?

19:40.080 --> 19:42.030
The name... of the other guy.

19:44.856 --> 19:47.406
It was his partner
who raped those women

19:47.850 --> 19:49.931
and murdered Jessica Goodall.

19:50.970 --> 19:54.020
And for eight years,
Chris will give you his name.

19:56.981 --> 19:58.395
This may surprise you,{\(Mr. Stroh,}

19:58.520 --> 20:01.850
but we're very close to finding
Chris'partner on our own.

20:01.975 --> 20:04.128
- Really?
- If you'd like me to talk to the D.A.

20:04.253 --> 20:06.284
About giving you any kind of a deal,

20:06.409 --> 20:10.122
I suggest that you have Chris Dunlap
tell me something I don't already know.

20:10.692 --> 20:12.542
And it had better be good.

20:15.304 --> 20:18.037
Chris Dunlap, you are under arrest
for murder and 6 counts of rape.

20:18.162 --> 20:21.603
Sgt Gabriel, would you please take him
downstairs to booking? Thank you.

20:21.728 --> 20:23.676
Have a nice day, Mr. Stroh.

20:30.811 --> 20:33.361
Now his lawyer says
there's another guy.

20:41.919 --> 20:45.491
You don't like it, but I think
you've got to consider the deal.

20:45.863 --> 20:48.902
It's not right to let Chris Dunlap
walk after only eight years

20:49.027 --> 20:50.877
just to get this other guy.

20:51.002 --> 20:53.652
- What does Pope say?
- He agrees with me.

20:54.837 --> 20:55.835
Really?

20:55.960 --> 20:59.960
He's still smarting from that stupid
inquiry after the mall shooting.

21:00.537 --> 21:02.587
No one's letting him forget it.

21:03.001 --> 21:07.005
He managed to delay everything yesterday
while we hunted through Dunlap's life,

21:07.852 --> 21:10.720
but if we don't find
this creep's partner. If...

21:10.845 --> 21:12.895
this other partner even exists.

21:13.144 --> 21:16.999
Well, if he doesn't exist, then whatever
deal Dunlap's lawyer makes goes away.

21:17.124 --> 21:20.374
At the very least, you put
your suspect away for life.

21:21.632 --> 21:24.655
Or... if the other guy's real,

21:25.293 --> 21:28.393
then you get his name
and take him off the streets.

21:28.857 --> 21:31.657
Chris Dunlap walked
into these women's homes.

21:31.793 --> 21:33.893
He assessed their vulnerability.

21:34.408 --> 21:37.758
They probably tipped him
after he chose them as victims.

21:37.947 --> 21:41.697
He's a monster. He deserves
to go away for the rest of his life.

21:42.844 --> 21:46.234
You know, if this other guy is really
out there, then he's dangerous.

21:46.359 --> 21:49.555
The longer you wait, the more likely
he is to disappear forever

21:49.855 --> 21:51.155
or attack again.

21:52.328 --> 21:53.934
Look, it's not a fair deal,

21:54.102 --> 21:57.503
and I know this isn't how you like to
hand off cases to the D.A., but, honey,

21:57.628 --> 21:59.478
hey, at the end of the day,

22:00.559 --> 22:01.858
it may be necessary.

22:04.660 --> 22:07.948
Chief, lieutenant Provenza and Tao
got a warrant to search

22:08.116 --> 22:10.626
Dunlap's place to see if we could
find anything that might tip us off

22:10.751 --> 22:12.119
to this mysterious second man.

22:12.287 --> 22:14.936
And Sanchez is talking to a kid
who does deliveries with Dunlap.

22:15.061 --> 22:16.498
He's kind of a long shot,

22:16.666 --> 22:19.648
but he does have a juvenile conviction
for burglary, so who knows?

22:19.773 --> 22:21.670
Chief, if you ask me,
they're playing us.

22:21.956 --> 22:24.798
They're making up a soddi defense
so they can buy more time.

22:25.063 --> 22:26.591
- Making up a what?
- Soddi.

22:26.759 --> 22:28.628
"Some other dude did it" defense.

22:28.753 --> 22:32.055
But considering our witnesses
couldn't I.D. the suspect,

22:32.307 --> 22:33.849
we may be wrong.
I don't know.

22:34.822 --> 22:36.101
Chief Johnson, any luck?

22:37.145 --> 22:40.377
We haven't found Chris' partner yet,
if that's what you're asking.

22:40.502 --> 22:42.107
May I speak with you for a moment?

22:47.451 --> 22:49.281
I tried explaining things
to the deputy D.A.,

22:49.449 --> 22:50.782
but I can't hold him off.

22:50.950 --> 22:53.201
He's, like, half a block away,
and he wants the deal.

22:53.579 --> 22:55.704
- For eight years?!
- I don't like it, either,

22:55.872 --> 22:56.921
but...

22:57.180 --> 22:58.566
it has to be this way.

22:58.691 --> 23:00.981
Bring back the suspect.
Get his lawyer.

23:01.106 --> 23:03.628
I'll be back in a minute
with the D.D.A.

23:03.796 --> 23:04.936
I'm sorry.

23:07.722 --> 23:09.052
Detective Sanchez, any chance

23:09.177 --> 23:11.429
the guy who made deliveries
with Chris might be his partner?

23:11.554 --> 23:13.854
I'm sorry, chief.
The alibi's good.

23:14.020 --> 23:17.957
He did say that chris asked to use
the bathroom a lot during deliveries,

23:18.082 --> 23:19.659
which is against the rules,

23:19.784 --> 23:22.647
and that he liked to look
at the customers' pictures,

23:22.984 --> 23:24.566
the ones in the frames.

23:25.719 --> 23:27.669
Co-worker said it was creepy.

23:31.411 --> 23:33.586
Commander, where are we
with the rest of the victims?

23:33.711 --> 23:35.389
We've been going through
the rape files.

23:35.514 --> 23:38.657
Five of the victims either
can't remember what happened

23:38.782 --> 23:40.457
or never saw the assailant's face.

23:40.625 --> 23:43.835
Apparently, he wore a mask
or something... pantyhose.

23:44.003 --> 23:45.503
What about the sixth victim?

23:45.671 --> 23:46.821
Lauren Clark.

23:47.277 --> 23:50.077
She saw him.
Never I.D.'d him from the books.

23:50.243 --> 23:52.052
Dunlap wasn't in the books.

23:52.849 --> 23:55.249
- You want me to bring her in?
- Yes.

23:55.640 --> 23:57.740
But we're supposed
to evaluate her state of mind

23:57.865 --> 24:00.815
before we put her through that,
so, no, not yet.

24:01.524 --> 24:04.147
Sorry, chief, but there's nothing
where Chris Dunlap lived

24:04.315 --> 24:07.199
that would point to the so-called
other partner, but...

24:07.324 --> 24:09.194
He's awfully strange.

24:09.654 --> 24:12.322
He lives in the attic
at his mother's house.

24:12.849 --> 24:15.742
Very little furniture,
a mattress on the floor.

24:16.786 --> 24:18.870
Lots of lingerie catalogs.

24:20.122 --> 24:22.824
And a big wad of cash
stuffed in one of his shoes...

24:22.949 --> 24:24.276
Close to $5,500.

24:24.401 --> 24:27.353
Yeah, now, we asked the mom about it,
she said she's helping him to save up

24:27.478 --> 24:28.463
to fix his face.

24:28.788 --> 24:30.957
- What?
- Plastic surgery.

24:31.284 --> 24:33.334
Yeah, mommy seems to think that

24:33.618 --> 24:35.553
her little boy needs to be
better-looking,

24:35.721 --> 24:37.889
oh, and got all the brochures, too.

24:38.328 --> 24:40.583
You know, botox, rhinoplasty.

24:40.708 --> 24:42.827
Chief. Chief, I finally spoke
to the paramedics.

24:42.952 --> 24:45.397
They said that they went through
the back door of Jessica's house

24:45.565 --> 24:48.604
to get the body, that they never
touched the front door.

24:48.729 --> 24:51.234
Chief Johnson,
you remember D.D.A. Garnett.

24:51.359 --> 24:52.746
Yes. Just one second, please.

24:52.871 --> 24:56.699
Sergeant, what do you think this is
on Jessica's front porch?

24:58.817 --> 24:59.744
Looks like...

25:00.986 --> 25:01.746
popcorn.

25:01.914 --> 25:04.379
But none of our guys went out this way,
so who tracked it outside?

25:04.504 --> 25:06.407
Our officer chased Chris
out the back door while

25:06.532 --> 25:08.840
the murder walked
right out the front!

25:08.965 --> 25:10.425
- Chief Johnson.
- Yes?

25:10.550 --> 25:12.050
Your office, please.

25:16.183 --> 25:19.263
Now that you have confirmed
the existence of Mr. Dunlap's partner,

25:19.388 --> 25:22.109
In the interest of public safety,
we are compelled to act.

25:22.234 --> 25:24.310
- I don't agree to the 8 years.
- It's not up to you.

25:24.478 --> 25:26.771
Let's be clear here, Garnett,
for the record.

25:26.939 --> 25:29.774
You are insisting on making this deal
despite the fact that the L.A.P.D.

25:29.942 --> 25:31.335
needs more time to investigate.

25:31.460 --> 25:33.521
You understand,
I shouldn't have to explain it again.

25:33.646 --> 25:35.646
Can we get on with it, please?

25:39.820 --> 25:42.036
The D.A.'s office is willing
to consider the 8 years

25:42.204 --> 25:44.372
if your client will tell us
who his accomplice is,

25:44.922 --> 25:48.585
Assuming said accomplice committed
the murder and the sexual assaults.

25:51.404 --> 25:54.841
And here I thought you were close
to finding said accomplice

25:55.009 --> 25:56.134
on your own.

25:57.868 --> 26:00.597
I don't like being manipulated,
chief Johnson.

26:01.936 --> 26:04.892
Mr. Garnett, you can have the name.
But now my client wants probation.

26:05.892 --> 26:07.061
- What?
- Sir,

26:07.229 --> 26:09.512
- there's a murder at large.
- Then you'd better hurry.

26:09.637 --> 26:12.126
You are an officer of the court
and therefore obligated to aid...

26:12.251 --> 26:14.218
I am well aware
of my obligations, chief Johnson,

26:14.343 --> 26:16.430
as they relate to my client.

26:16.555 --> 26:18.644
Now, he has some
very important information

26:18.769 --> 26:20.450
that should be passed on to you, but

26:20.618 --> 26:22.654
I need to know he's getting
the best deal possible.

26:22.779 --> 26:26.372
And how do we convince you that
eight years is reasonable?

26:27.289 --> 26:29.500
- Show me your evidence.
- We are not doing that.

26:29.668 --> 26:31.753
Convince me you've
something substantial against him.

26:31.953 --> 26:33.379
I am not opening up my case.

26:33.547 --> 26:35.631
- He's got no incentive to give up...
- No way!

26:35.799 --> 26:37.675
I'll talk to him.
We can reach a compromise.

26:37.843 --> 26:40.695
Compromise?!
It is eight years, or there's no deal!

26:40.820 --> 26:41.980
Hold on one second.

26:42.105 --> 26:44.599
Mr. Stroh, could you excuse us
for just one moment, please?

26:45.881 --> 26:46.882
Thank you.

26:52.012 --> 26:53.881
I refuse to put
my evidence on display here.

26:54.006 --> 26:56.444
Excuse me? What evidence?
You don't have any.

26:56.612 --> 26:58.992
The investigation
is barely 24 hours old.

26:59.117 --> 27:02.311
To be manipulated into a plea agreement
for probation is ridiculous!

27:02.436 --> 27:05.450
I'm reduced to this possibility
because you haven't found me a killer.

27:05.575 --> 27:08.623
We need some time to go through
the old cases... a few days!

27:09.068 --> 27:13.018
With an active rapist on the loose,
a guy who just murdered someone?

27:13.270 --> 27:14.212
No way.

27:16.019 --> 27:17.613
I think this is a mistake.

27:17.738 --> 27:19.675
And you are the reigning expert
on mistakes,

27:19.843 --> 27:23.012
but this can't be one of them.
Now, do I do this with her or without?

27:29.211 --> 27:31.455
Victim 4, Kim Stansbury,

27:31.580 --> 27:33.064
raped january 12.

27:33.332 --> 27:36.833
Do you have any physical evidence
linking my client to the scene?

27:36.958 --> 27:37.995
No.

27:40.363 --> 27:42.490
No blood, no semen, no hair?

27:43.153 --> 27:44.327
No. No. No.

27:44.452 --> 27:46.136
Same as all the rest.

27:46.745 --> 27:49.795
- Any fingerprints I.D.'d to my client?
- Not yet.

27:50.541 --> 27:53.584
Any victim I.D.s or independent
witnesses that place him at the scene?

27:53.752 --> 27:55.285
No, but we do have him delivering

27:55.410 --> 27:58.510
a refrigerator to her six days
before the incident.

28:01.413 --> 28:02.760
Victim 5,

28:02.928 --> 28:05.342
Rebecca Howl, raped january 20.

28:05.749 --> 28:08.305
- Any physical evidence?
- We have him delivering a refrigerator

28:08.430 --> 28:09.809
to her five days before.

28:12.799 --> 28:14.980
Victim 6, Lauren Clark.

28:18.020 --> 28:19.942
Should I assume
the same as the preceding five?

28:20.067 --> 28:22.988
Actually, she says
she can identify the assailant.

28:23.530 --> 28:24.648
Interesting.

28:24.915 --> 28:27.535
But do you have any blood,
semen, hair,

28:27.703 --> 28:29.601
or any other physical evidence?

28:29.726 --> 28:30.726
No.

28:32.597 --> 28:34.542
All right, lastly, Jessica Goodall.

28:40.272 --> 28:41.093
Anything?

28:41.218 --> 28:43.185
Other the fact that
your client was seen running

28:43.310 --> 28:44.945
from the back of the victim's house

28:45.070 --> 28:49.074
by a los angeles police officer and
found hiding in a tree 30 minutes later,

28:49.622 --> 28:50.822
- no.
- Okay.

28:51.850 --> 28:53.010
Thank you.

28:53.698 --> 28:57.022
I will discuss this with Chris,
and, if he's in agreement,

28:57.454 --> 29:01.076
I'll write up the proffer to state that,
in addition to details of the crimes,

29:01.201 --> 29:02.945
he will reveal
the name of his partner.

29:03.113 --> 29:04.655
We can meet in the morning, and...

29:04.823 --> 29:05.656
No.

29:06.215 --> 29:08.826
We're doing this tonight.
You've got five hours, sir.

29:10.424 --> 29:11.450
Fine.

29:12.406 --> 29:13.607
Mr. Garnett.

29:13.982 --> 29:15.182
Chief Johnson.

29:18.654 --> 29:20.680
This is the right thing to do.

29:21.102 --> 29:22.802
Not for Jessica Goodall.

29:23.509 --> 29:24.644
Excuse me.

29:27.556 --> 29:28.554
Chief Johnson.

29:29.991 --> 29:31.015
Stroh is here.

29:32.080 --> 29:33.181
You ready?

29:34.270 --> 29:35.978
As I'll ever be.
What's the offer?

29:37.049 --> 29:40.899
His client gives up the name.
We split the difference, four years.

29:41.928 --> 29:43.547
This accomplice has a methodology.

29:43.672 --> 29:46.155
He's not gonna strike again
while we have Chris Dunlap in custody.

29:46.323 --> 29:48.554
- We have time to look for him.
- We're gonna find the guy

29:48.679 --> 29:50.576
a lot faster once we know his name.

29:50.820 --> 29:52.718
Can we just execute the deal?

29:52.843 --> 29:53.862
Please?

30:02.775 --> 30:04.214
<i>All right.</i>

30:04.382 --> 30:06.423
<i>Mr. Stroh. Chris.</i>

30:07.647 --> 30:10.054
You've read the statement
and agree to provide testimony

30:10.222 --> 30:13.622
as to the truthfulness of the facts
within this document?

30:16.241 --> 30:20.197
Four years for the name,
provided we can verify its validity.

30:23.423 --> 30:25.527
Mr. Stroh, maybe it's my ears,
but for the life of me,

30:25.695 --> 30:27.542
I can't hear
what your client is saying.

30:27.667 --> 30:28.667
Chris.

30:29.273 --> 30:30.673
Yes, I'll testify.

30:30.946 --> 30:31.946
Good.

30:32.373 --> 30:34.273
Would you sign this, please?

30:39.317 --> 30:40.417
Thank you.

30:42.404 --> 30:45.435
OK, you state here that
you were charged with finding women

30:45.560 --> 30:47.991
on your delivery that would best fit
your partner's type.

30:48.116 --> 30:49.988
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

30:50.613 --> 30:51.664
He...

30:52.340 --> 30:54.056
He likes blond hair.

30:56.496 --> 30:59.592
So you would unlock the windows
and watch them for a few days?

30:59.717 --> 31:02.022
To make sure there were
no roommates or boyfriends, right.

31:02.283 --> 31:03.815
And once you were sure?

31:05.786 --> 31:07.630
He'd pick a night.
We'd go in together.

31:07.755 --> 31:09.905
I'd watch the street, and he'd...

31:10.865 --> 31:11.990
He'd be with them.

31:15.057 --> 31:16.935
You state that you never
actually participated

31:17.060 --> 31:18.884
in any of the sexual assaults
yourself...

31:19.009 --> 31:19.794
No.

31:19.919 --> 31:22.426
... that you acted only as lookout
for your partner, and in return,

31:22.551 --> 31:24.144
he compensated you monetarily.

31:24.269 --> 31:25.162
Yes.

31:25.287 --> 31:26.338
How much?

31:30.360 --> 31:32.123
$1,500 apiece.

31:32.493 --> 31:33.720
That's a lot.

31:34.074 --> 31:36.361
I'm sure you must have been
worth it, though.

31:36.486 --> 31:38.772
In fact, if we weren't talking
about rape and murder,

31:38.897 --> 31:41.497
sounds like
you'd make an ideal employee.

31:45.725 --> 31:47.052
Now comes the hard part,

31:47.177 --> 31:50.510
and you had better tell the whole truth
and nothing but, so help you god,

31:50.635 --> 31:52.656
or this deal
for four years goes away.

31:54.776 --> 31:56.876
What's the name of your partner?

31:59.019 --> 32:00.664
It's okay, Chris, go ahead.

32:03.796 --> 32:04.885
It's him.

32:05.544 --> 32:06.762
Excuse me?!

32:07.166 --> 32:09.172
- What the hell?
- It's Mr. Stroh.

32:09.340 --> 32:12.047
- Chris, this is not funny.
- What? Did something change?

32:12.172 --> 32:14.522
Enough! That's it!
You, outside now!

32:21.023 --> 32:23.523
Just when you thought
you heard it all.

32:26.977 --> 32:29.230
Would you mind telling me
what the hell's going on in here?!

32:29.355 --> 32:32.059
I am as shocked as you are. Believe me.
I explained to him very specifically

32:32.184 --> 32:34.049
- what he need to do.
- If you're pulling some

32:34.174 --> 32:37.033
- kind of a stunt, so help me.
- I was... thrilled with four years.

32:37.201 --> 32:39.350
In fact, I think it's what
he deserves. I told him so.

32:39.475 --> 32:41.516
I can promise you
it's not gonna get any better.

32:41.641 --> 32:43.331
I don't know what to tell you,
except:

32:43.499 --> 32:45.917
I can't represent him
if he's accusing me of this.

32:46.085 --> 32:48.434
No. No.
You wrote up this proffer, sir.

32:48.559 --> 32:50.725
We are not going anywhere
until we get a name.

32:50.850 --> 32:52.750
All right. Hold on. Hold on.

32:59.481 --> 33:01.266
<i>Now, Chris,
just so we are perfectly clear,</i>

33:01.434 --> 33:03.555
<i>- this deal that you signed...
- Where's Mr. Stroh?</i>

33:03.680 --> 33:05.854
- What did he say?
- He said you should get yourself

33:06.022 --> 33:07.414
<i>- a new lawyer.
- What?</i>

33:07.539 --> 33:09.531
<i>- Frankly, I don't blame him.
- I don't understand.</i>

33:09.656 --> 33:11.776
This game you're playing
is a waste of everyone's time.

33:11.901 --> 33:14.104
He promised me,
if I kept my mouth shut...

33:14.229 --> 33:15.781
- You're ruining it.
- No, I swear.

33:15.906 --> 33:18.301
If this is some crazy attempt
to get a better deal,

33:18.426 --> 33:20.533
you are climbing up
the wrong tree... again!

33:20.658 --> 33:22.841
And if you don't straighten up,
and right this second,

33:22.966 --> 33:25.110
instead of 4 years,
you're looking at the death penalty!

33:25.235 --> 33:26.856
Do you understand me?!

33:28.148 --> 33:31.087
I'll ask you one more time.
What is the name of your partner?

33:33.255 --> 33:34.716
It's... It's Mr. Stroh.

33:35.954 --> 33:38.232
- That's it. We're through here.
- No, wait! Wait!

33:38.357 --> 33:41.264
I'm telling you the truth!
He just wanted to see what you had on us

33:41.596 --> 33:43.246
before I talked to you.

33:51.775 --> 33:53.902
Why would he need to do that?

33:54.991 --> 33:58.615
<i>He wanted to make sure you didn't have
any evidence on him. I swear. I swear.</i>

33:58.864 --> 34:01.793
I swear, I wanted to tell you everything
from the very beginning.

34:01.918 --> 34:03.995
But Mr. Stroh,
he said that if I ever was caught,

34:04.163 --> 34:05.952
I was supposed to call him
right away.

34:06.077 --> 34:09.277
And when that girl got hurt
and when the police came,

34:09.739 --> 34:11.543
He told me to run out the back door,

34:11.712 --> 34:15.161
and when I couldn't get away,
I did what he told me to do.

34:15.780 --> 34:17.217
<i>'cause Mr. Stroh, he told me,</i>

34:17.385 --> 34:19.960
<i>He said that even though
I hadn't done anything as bad as him</i>

34:20.085 --> 34:22.107
<i>that I would go to jail
for as long as he did</i>

34:22.232 --> 34:24.474
if I admitted anything
before I got a deal.

34:30.551 --> 34:32.601
Why did you do those things for him?

34:32.726 --> 34:34.326
He saved me from jail.

34:37.007 --> 34:39.614
And he wanted to help me
with my face.

34:41.826 --> 34:45.744
So when he asked me to use my job
to help him find these...

34:48.418 --> 34:49.998
I didn't want to let him down.

34:51.657 --> 34:53.043
So I found a girl.

34:53.476 --> 34:55.463
I found a really pretty girl

34:56.272 --> 35:00.219
that I knew he'd like, and I unlocked
the window, and we went in.

35:05.868 --> 35:07.173
I hid the money.

35:07.455 --> 35:09.658
You can find it in my room.

35:12.203 --> 35:14.256
I'm saving it up 'cause my mom

35:14.581 --> 35:16.567
says she can make me handsome.

35:23.211 --> 35:25.598
So, wait... Is... is that it?

35:27.909 --> 35:29.956
Do I... do I get my deal?

35:51.925 --> 35:53.855
You have anything to say, mr. Stroh?

35:57.096 --> 35:59.954
I guess I'd have to say he's crazy.

36:03.332 --> 36:06.367
I mean, he sounded so convincing.
He almost had me believing him, but...

36:07.836 --> 36:10.665
Come on, let's be honest.
That story is absurd.

36:10.790 --> 36:11.943
Yes, it is.

36:13.040 --> 36:14.380
Mr. Garnett, it seems to me

36:14.505 --> 36:17.297
that your presence here
could be a conflict of interest.

36:17.422 --> 36:20.214
If you stay,
you risk being called as a witness.

36:25.649 --> 36:29.249
Seems strangely self-destructive
of Chris, don't you think...

36:29.570 --> 36:32.560
Knowing that a lie would ruin
his chances to walk in four years?

36:33.635 --> 36:34.695
True.

36:35.150 --> 36:36.702
He blows his deal.

36:36.961 --> 36:37.961
But...

36:38.291 --> 36:40.991
You can't use anything
he said against him.

36:42.238 --> 36:44.306
Or against me, for that matter.

36:45.075 --> 36:47.909
Because, unfortunately for Chris,

36:48.495 --> 36:51.746
even if he was telling the truth,
even if I was an accomplice,

36:52.782 --> 36:56.120
in order to have his statement
admitted in court, you'd need some sort

36:56.245 --> 37:00.245
of corroborating evidence linking me
to at least one of these crimes.

37:00.893 --> 37:03.196
And, as you and Mr. Garnett

37:03.705 --> 37:06.005
made abundantly clear earlier today,

37:06.964 --> 37:08.596
you have no such evidence.

37:09.983 --> 37:11.101
So...

37:12.319 --> 37:13.897
If I'm not mistake

37:15.094 --> 37:16.771
we're through here.

37:18.273 --> 37:20.887
We have a witness, Mr. Stroh,
your sixth victim.

37:21.012 --> 37:23.712
Lauren Clark,
she says she can make an I.D.

37:25.513 --> 37:26.535
Right.

37:27.585 --> 37:29.035
I forgot about her.

37:29.433 --> 37:31.243
- You bringing her in?
- Yes, we are.

37:31.411 --> 37:33.996
So is there anyone you'd like to call?
Your lawyer, perhaps?

37:34.789 --> 37:37.639
No. That's very considerate of you.
Thank you.

37:38.093 --> 37:40.419
But...
Since I am a lawyer,

37:41.250 --> 37:43.050
I think i'll be just fine.

37:44.275 --> 37:46.884
And my advice to me would be to...

37:48.266 --> 37:49.376
Wait.

37:50.890 --> 37:52.434
So... I'll wait...

37:53.644 --> 37:55.444
Right here if that's okay.

38:03.789 --> 38:06.112
Miss Clark, I'm deputy chief
Brenda Leigh Johnson.

38:06.753 --> 38:09.047
Thank you so much
for coming down here so late.

38:09.172 --> 38:11.010
No, that's okay.
It's just...

38:11.135 --> 38:13.452
Scary thinking
that I might see him again.

38:14.738 --> 38:16.080
My stomach's in knots.

38:16.719 --> 38:18.013
I understand.

38:18.875 --> 38:20.925
Why don't you have a seat here?

38:21.942 --> 38:24.255
I'm gonna tell you
that none of these men in the lineup

38:24.423 --> 38:27.673
can see or hear you, okay?
You're perfectly safe here.

38:28.337 --> 38:30.344
You just take your time, all right?

38:30.512 --> 38:32.009
Ready to go, chief.

38:43.312 --> 38:44.730
I'm sorry. Wait.

38:45.485 --> 38:47.486
What if I know one of them?

38:47.887 --> 38:48.887
Who?

38:49.614 --> 38:51.657
Him, number 2.
I don't remember his name.

38:53.264 --> 38:55.208
- You know him?
- Yeah, he...

38:55.333 --> 38:57.997
He stopped by my work
a few hours ago. He's...

38:58.165 --> 39:00.495
a lawyer, Phil, I think.

39:00.620 --> 39:02.668
He said I'd probably
be coming down here tonight.

39:06.324 --> 39:07.214
Is that bad?

39:13.948 --> 39:15.922
He can't tamper with a witness
in his own case.

39:16.047 --> 39:18.801
Six hours ago,
it was his client's case.

39:18.926 --> 39:21.860
He'll say he was questioning her, which,
at the time, he had every right to do.

39:21.985 --> 39:24.148
He knew where she worked.
He couldn't have known that...

39:24.316 --> 39:26.235
Without looking at our files.

39:26.360 --> 39:29.069
Remember the part where you insisted
that we show him everything?

39:31.394 --> 39:34.394
You ever make a deal
with the devil, Mr. Garnett?

39:37.418 --> 39:39.518
This is probably what it's like.

39:44.958 --> 39:46.458
Thank you, sergeant.

39:47.941 --> 39:49.293
Chief Johnson.

39:50.240 --> 39:53.444
Did the search warrants served
at my home and office get you anywhere?

39:53.569 --> 39:54.569
No,

39:55.588 --> 39:58.217
but you had plenty of time
to dispose of anything incriminating

39:58.342 --> 40:01.310
while our investigation
was focused on your client.

40:01.641 --> 40:04.211
I'll admit to being mildly interested
in how you managed to rape

40:04.336 --> 40:06.648
seven women without
getting a mark on you.

40:07.411 --> 40:08.621
How about...

40:09.026 --> 40:11.153
I didn't rape seven women?

40:11.633 --> 40:13.323
Oh, I'm sorry. Six.

40:14.533 --> 40:16.133
One you just murdered.

40:16.743 --> 40:19.411
For which your former client
may now be facing life in prison.

40:19.800 --> 40:20.826
Well,

40:21.035 --> 40:23.185
he's obviously a dangerous guy...

40:24.548 --> 40:26.083
Criminally immature.

40:28.369 --> 40:30.764
But his next attorney
will probably throw out

40:30.889 --> 40:32.889
most of what you've done here.

40:34.616 --> 40:37.316
I'm sorry for wasting
so much of your time.

40:38.306 --> 40:40.932
I really should have mentioned
meeting Miss Clark

40:41.057 --> 40:43.457
when I left this afternoon,
but it...

40:44.180 --> 40:45.880
Totally slipped my mind.

40:47.030 --> 40:49.630
She didn't seem terribly bright,
did she?

40:50.385 --> 40:51.703
Pretty, though.

40:52.988 --> 40:54.240
Mr. Stroh...

40:55.015 --> 40:57.653
You think you're walking away
from this a free man, but I assure you,

40:57.778 --> 41:01.128
you are in more trouble
than you could possibly imagine!

41:02.171 --> 41:03.789
I hope that's not a threat.

41:04.744 --> 41:06.902
I would hate to have to bring
a lawsuit against the city

41:07.027 --> 41:08.794
for violating my civil rights.

41:09.804 --> 41:11.131
I know your accomplice.

41:11.256 --> 41:13.553
I know the women you raped
and the woman you murdered.

41:13.678 --> 41:16.092
And with the help
of every law-enforcement agency

41:16.217 --> 41:18.970
in the county of los angeles,
which, as of today, will become

41:19.138 --> 41:22.408
a permanent fixture in your life,
I will hunt relentlessly

41:22.533 --> 41:25.102
to tie you to these crimes
until the day you die.

41:25.227 --> 41:26.237
Really?

41:27.276 --> 41:29.162
What is it you hope to accomplish?

41:29.287 --> 41:31.441
To see you
on trial for murder, Mr. Stroh.

41:33.360 --> 41:34.674
Well, then...

41:35.225 --> 41:38.824
you must feel terribly disappointed
in the way things have turned out here.

41:40.274 --> 41:42.356
Look on the bright side, chief.

41:44.146 --> 41:45.596
At least it's over.

41:46.674 --> 41:47.666
It's not over.

41:50.216 --> 41:51.234
It is.
