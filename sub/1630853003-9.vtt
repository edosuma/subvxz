00:09.500 --> 00:12.833
- Ali's real first name
is Cassius.
- Is George.

00:12.916 --> 00:15.083
- No, that's Foreman.
- Oh.

00:15.166 --> 00:18.333
- Go on and get up there.
I'm paying this guy.
- I don't want him to...

00:18.416 --> 00:20.875
Oh, for. goodness sakes.

00:20.958 --> 00:22.375
Breakfast is served.

00:22.458 --> 00:25.166
More grass.
I feel like a cow.

00:25.250 --> 00:26.708
That stuff is
state-of-the-art.

00:26.791 --> 00:28.583
That nutritionist
does all of NASA.

00:28.666 --> 00:32.083
- Next, you'll be
launching me into space.
- Jeanie, make sure

00:32.166 --> 00:33.750
she drinks that whole
thing, will you?

00:33.833 --> 00:35.708
Put a wine spritzer
in if you have to.

00:35.791 --> 00:38.208
- Make it gin, and it's a deal.

00:38.291 --> 00:39.708
Ah! Don't touch me!

00:39.791 --> 00:42.083
I've asked you to do nothing...

00:42.166 --> 00:44.958
- How's she doin'?
- Are you kiddin'?

00:45.041 --> 00:47.208
She's about to get felt up
by a guy half her age.

00:47.291 --> 00:48.666
She's thrilled.

00:51.541 --> 00:53.708
What?
What's wrong with you?

00:53.791 --> 00:55.541
I just told him
the good news.

00:55.625 --> 00:58.958
First-round playoff
tickets went on sale.
Sold out in a day.

00:59.041 --> 01:00.708
That's a half a million dollars.

01:00.791 --> 01:04.458
- That's great.
- If we were playing
in the first round.

01:04.541 --> 01:07.041
Seattle lost.
We clinched a bye.

01:07.125 --> 01:08.416
That's two fewer home games.

01:08.500 --> 01:11.083
And that's a half
a million dollars in refunds.

01:11.166 --> 01:13.500
Plus what we would
have made in concessions.

01:13.583 --> 01:17.083
- So we lose money by winning.
- Welcome to the NBA.

01:17.166 --> 01:19.375
Is there any chance we're
still gonna break even?

01:19.458 --> 01:21.041
If we make the finals

01:21.125 --> 01:23.625
with an extended series,
we'll get close.

01:23.708 --> 01:25.000
Anything less than that...

01:25.083 --> 01:27.666
She'll be working for
the Great Western Bank.

01:27.750 --> 01:29.791
Meanwhile, I know
it's lousy timing,

01:29.875 --> 01:31.541
but I need some more help.

01:31.625 --> 01:35.166
- Marketing, PR,
another full-time hire.
- Yeah, sure.

01:35.250 --> 01:36.333
Sure. Why not two, huh?

01:36.416 --> 01:38.500
It's just a little bit
more money that

01:38.583 --> 01:39.666
we don't got in the first place.

01:39.750 --> 01:42.333
- Huh? Go crazy.
- I'm thinking Jeanie.

01:44.083 --> 01:46.583
- Who?

01:46.666 --> 01:49.708
- I'ma get that.
You two, uh, têtê-à-têtê.

01:52.458 --> 01:54.041
You mean my Jeanie?

01:54.125 --> 01:56.958
- I know she's got lots going on.
- She's taking care of my mother.

01:57.041 --> 01:59.416
Right. Which is
a top priority, of course.

01:59.500 --> 02:01.500
Claire, it's the only priority.

02:01.583 --> 02:03.541
Look, if she's spreading
herself too thin at the office,

02:03.625 --> 02:05.708
- she doesn't have to go there.
- It's the opposite.

02:05.791 --> 02:07.541
She's invaluable.

02:07.625 --> 02:08.833
Even with everything going on.

02:08.916 --> 02:10.708
I don't know how she does it,
to be honest.

02:10.791 --> 02:13.875
But this thing that we've built?
It's her as much as anybody.

02:13.958 --> 02:16.291
Probably more. And she has...

02:16.375 --> 02:19.916
- earned this opportunity.
- Don't mind me. I'm just...

02:21.125 --> 02:23.458
- Sneaking up on me?
- No, sir.

02:25.708 --> 02:27.500
I'm glad she's been useful,

02:27.583 --> 02:30.041
but we need her here,
so get somebody else.

02:30.125 --> 02:32.958
- Ay,<i> marone.</i>
Fuck. Jerry?

02:33.041 --> 02:35.083
What, Francis?
More good news?

02:35.166 --> 02:36.458
McKinney.

02:37.750 --> 02:38.958
What happened with the test?

02:39.041 --> 02:41.333
The doctor didn't
clear him to coach?

02:41.416 --> 02:42.708
Worse. He did.

02:42.791 --> 02:45.166
And now Jack's saying
he's ready to come back

02:45.250 --> 02:48.625
and coach the playoffs,
so long as you dump Westhead.

02:54.916 --> 02:57.750
("My Favorite Mutiny"
by The Coup playing

04:25.250 --> 04:26.500

04:29.000 --> 04:30.333
<i>All it's missing is McKinney.</i>

04:30.416 --> 04:32.125
A few weeks ago,

04:32.208 --> 04:33.666
Jack McKinney
didn't have a skull.

04:33.750 --> 04:35.958
Jerry, I wouldn't trust
him to park my car.

04:38.708 --> 04:41.416
Stick with the horse what
brung you. That's Westhead.

04:41.500 --> 04:44.291
- McKinney. He's the brains
behind it all.
- Brains mean shit

04:44.375 --> 04:46.083
if he just spilled the best
part on the pavement.

04:46.166 --> 04:47.666
He's never even
coached a playoff game.

04:47.750 --> 04:49.291
We don't even know if Jack
can process solid food.

04:49.375 --> 04:51.333
We know that Paul's
still eating Gerber's.

04:51.416 --> 04:55.458
Westhead. McKinney. Westhead.
McKinney. Westhead. McKinney...

04:55.541 --> 04:58.708
Alright already.
He's heard enough. Dr. Buss?

04:59.583 --> 05:00.791
What do you think?

05:05.458 --> 05:07.250
Playoffs are starting in a week.

05:13.625 --> 05:15.291
Who's it gonna be?

05:19.416 --> 05:21.041
I think we ought to sleep on it.

05:21.125 --> 05:22.500
No! N-no! No,

05:22.583 --> 05:25.666
you do not fuckin' dump that
turd on my fuckin' doorstep.

05:25.750 --> 05:27.708
I'm not asking you
to come back, Jerry.

05:27.791 --> 05:30.958
- I'm just asking for your
opinion,<i> mano a mano.</i>
- Oh, yeah, right.

05:31.041 --> 05:32.500
And then what, huh?

05:32.583 --> 05:35.166
It's on fuckin' me.
It's on my fuckin' conscience

05:35.250 --> 05:36.291
when whomever I choose

05:36.375 --> 05:39.083
craps the fuckin' bed.
I know. Fuck that!

05:39.166 --> 05:41.000
Fuck that and fuck you!

05:41.083 --> 05:43.916
- Jerry, look at me...
- No, I'm not-- Fuck, no.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.375
Look at me.

05:49.625 --> 05:52.416
I'm gonna tell you something
I don't tell many people.

05:54.500 --> 05:57.041
I am in over my head.

05:58.291 --> 06:00.708
I bought this thing,
and I own this thing,

06:00.791 --> 06:04.083
and I love this thing.
But you are this thing.

06:05.291 --> 06:07.208
So, you...

06:07.291 --> 06:09.791
You want-- You wanna
know what I would do?

06:13.916 --> 06:15.208
Fuck no. Beg somebody else.

06:15.291 --> 06:17.500
Believe me,
I've asked everybody.

06:17.583 --> 06:19.000
Hell, I'm about to
call a damn priest.

06:19.083 --> 06:20.458
No! Don't fuckin'--
don't do that.

06:20.541 --> 06:21.500
No, fuckin' chances are

06:21.583 --> 06:22.958
he's rooting for
the fuckin' Celtics.

06:23.041 --> 06:24.041
So help me out here.

06:24.125 --> 06:26.625
Westhead or McKinney?

06:26.708 --> 06:28.500
No one has to know
it came from you.

06:30.083 --> 06:32.208
I just can't fuck this up.

06:37.208 --> 06:38.625
Let me sleep on it.

06:52.708 --> 06:54.625
Shit...

06:58.041 --> 07:00.250
Nice playoff suit,

07:00.333 --> 07:02.458
but I think, ha,
they wear this one

07:02.541 --> 07:05.666
- with pants in Italy.
- Yeah, I just hope I get
to wear the fuckin' thing.

07:05.750 --> 07:07.416
You're going to wear it
in the playoffs.

07:07.500 --> 07:09.708
As long as I'm not
watching on TV.

07:14.208 --> 07:17.083
Jack's pushing hard.

07:17.166 --> 07:20.291
The doctors cleared him.
Now, it's back in Buss' court.

07:20.375 --> 07:22.791
Then, Buss'll judge it
fair and square.

07:22.875 --> 07:25.500
He likes Jack.
He hired the guy.

07:25.583 --> 07:29.916
Yeah, but that was before you
and Paul delivered 50 wins.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.291
What if this whole thing has
just been a giant fuckin' tease?

07:34.375 --> 07:37.291
Well then, at least you know
that the suit fits.

07:37.375 --> 07:38.625
Worst comes to worst,

07:38.708 --> 07:41.916
you can wear it next year
in Cleveland or wherever.

07:43.291 --> 07:45.250
And I'll fly out once in a while

07:45.333 --> 07:47.666
and admire it
without the pants on.

07:51.083 --> 07:52.875
What's our mantra?

07:54.291 --> 07:56.916
Function forward.
Control what we can.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.541
Yes.

07:59.625 --> 08:03.625
Christ, Chris,
if they fucking dump us
after everything that we--

08:03.708 --> 08:06.166
Then they deserve what they get!

08:09.458 --> 08:12.458
The last thing anyone
should do right now

08:12.541 --> 08:14.666
is mess with chemistry.

08:38.833 --> 08:40.208
- Alright, guys.

08:40.291 --> 08:42.083
Let's get it on its feet.
We got a week till playoffs.

08:42.166 --> 08:44.083
Come on. No lazing around.
Let's go.

08:44.166 --> 08:46.500
Come on, Wood.
Let's get some shots up.

08:49.875 --> 08:52.291
Wood?

08:52.375 --> 08:54.708
Alright, come on, man.
I know you fucking with me.
Come on.

08:56.416 --> 08:58.291
- Come here.
- Wood.

09:00.416 --> 09:03.958
- Hey, Wood? Wood! Wood!

09:05.833 --> 09:07.625
The fuck y'all doing?
Get the fuck off me.

09:07.708 --> 09:09.291
Your eyes was open
like you was

09:09.375 --> 09:11.458
- a dead man or somethin'!
- So?

09:11.541 --> 09:13.625
It's called meditating,
motherfucker!

09:15.791 --> 09:17.708
Keep your eyes off me,
motherfucker.

09:17.791 --> 09:20.125
Pretty angry for a guy
who's meditating.

09:32.083 --> 09:33.375
Fuck.

09:35.666 --> 09:37.250
Fuck...

09:39.625 --> 09:41.166
Hey, Wood.

09:42.875 --> 09:44.208
What--

09:44.291 --> 09:46.041
The fuck you looking at?

09:46.125 --> 09:48.291
Nothin', man.

09:48.375 --> 09:49.666
Are you looking for these?

09:49.750 --> 09:53.416
You were out there already,
so I borrowed 'em.

09:53.500 --> 09:56.666
- You what?
- It's just your tape
and your cutters.

09:56.750 --> 10:00.250
- Took them out of your bag--
- Fuck you borrowing my shit
without asking my shit!

10:00.333 --> 10:03.125
- Jesus Christ! I'm sorry, man!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:03.208 --> 10:05.125
- Relax, man!
- Get the fuck off me, rook!

10:05.208 --> 10:07.000
You want some of this shit, too?

10:07.083 --> 10:08.083
Huh?

10:08.166 --> 10:10.541
- What you want?! Bring it!
- Fuck, relax!

10:23.416 --> 10:26.166
- Hold it!
- No! You ain't see
what happen, Cap!

10:26.250 --> 10:29.583
- This punk-ass rootin'
around in my shit!
- Cheryl spoke to Iman.

10:33.541 --> 10:35.291
You lied to me.

10:35.375 --> 10:37.583
It's you.
You're on that shit again!

10:38.875 --> 10:40.750
I fucked up, Cap.

10:40.833 --> 10:42.708
I did. A few times, I said it.
I fucked up a few times--

10:42.791 --> 10:44.708
I'm telling you, when
the monkey on your back--

10:44.791 --> 10:46.333
Stop!

10:48.625 --> 10:50.083
Do you want this, Spence?

10:50.875 --> 10:52.416
This!

10:52.500 --> 10:54.041
Because I do.

10:54.125 --> 10:56.666
More than anything
in a long time.

10:56.750 --> 10:58.833
Maybe my whole career.

10:58.916 --> 11:01.541
I do. I swear to you, I do.

11:01.625 --> 11:04.333
I want the ring.
I want to be able to give
this to my baby girl.

11:04.416 --> 11:06.333
Then cut it out.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.541
Right now!

11:08.625 --> 11:11.375
- Cold turkey.
- I can. I will.

11:12.166 --> 11:13.750
I got this.

11:17.333 --> 11:18.958
One shot.

11:25.916 --> 11:27.541
I ain't gonna let you down!

<i>Kareem in the post,</i>
<i>shakes one, two defenders.</i>

11:44.750 --> 11:46.666

<i>Unbelievable.</i>

And, gals, if you don't
mind waiting outside here,

12:30.000 --> 12:31.458
we'll be right out. Uh,

12:31.541 --> 12:33.958
there's magazines and candies
in the drawer there,

12:34.041 --> 12:36.083
- so, you know...
- Look at that!

12:36.166 --> 12:37.541
knock yourself out.

12:37.625 --> 12:39.458
Doc, I'm so glad
you could come out.

12:39.541 --> 12:41.666
Nice little victory
for you, too.

12:41.750 --> 12:44.666
- You see that?
- Not bad at all.

12:44.750 --> 12:47.916
Listen, I know my mom must be
putting you through the ringer,

12:48.000 --> 12:49.333
but it's not gonna be
much longer.

12:49.416 --> 12:51.083
That new stuff we got her
guzzling down?

12:51.166 --> 12:53.750
State-of-the-art.
Did you know

12:53.833 --> 12:56.958
that not a single
NASA astronaut

12:57.041 --> 12:59.208
has died of natural causes?

12:59.291 --> 13:01.458
- I did not.
- That's a fact.

13:01.541 --> 13:02.958
What are you drinking?
Chivas?

13:03.041 --> 13:06.458
- I-I saw her lab results.

13:06.541 --> 13:07.916
Oh. Okay. Well,

13:08.000 --> 13:09.708
gonna get right into it.

13:09.791 --> 13:11.958
What's the good news?
How's it looking?

13:12.041 --> 13:14.041
It's worse.

13:15.166 --> 13:17.125
Well, she just started
that new protocol.

13:17.208 --> 13:19.750
She's in the end game, Jerry.

13:19.833 --> 13:22.458
And all the signs are pointing
in the same direction.

13:22.541 --> 13:23.875
Don't misinterpret.
I'm not saying

13:23.958 --> 13:26.583
your experimental treatments
are to blame. They're not.

13:26.666 --> 13:27.916
It's just...

13:28.000 --> 13:29.666
a case like hers,

13:29.750 --> 13:32.333
certain outcomes are...

13:34.583 --> 13:36.000
What?

13:36.083 --> 13:37.833
Inevitable.

13:37.916 --> 13:39.333
I know that can be hard to hear.

13:39.416 --> 13:41.708
I don't like saying it,
but I have seen too many people

13:41.791 --> 13:44.583
waste too much precious time
tilting at windmills.

13:44.666 --> 13:47.750
And when the curtain closes,
all they're left with is regret.

13:49.416 --> 13:51.583
My advice, friend to friend,

13:52.750 --> 13:55.375
enjoy your mother
while you have her.

13:55.458 --> 13:57.666
Say the things you wish you had.

13:58.833 --> 14:01.125
That is your fucking attitude?

14:01.208 --> 14:03.416
- Jerry--
- Don't you "Jerry" me.

14:04.333 --> 14:06.416
No, no, don't you "Jerry" me.

14:06.500 --> 14:07.916
It's Dr. Buss,

14:08.000 --> 14:09.375
as in the guy who just built

14:09.458 --> 14:10.916
your hospital a fucking wing!

14:11.000 --> 14:13.666
- For which the board
is very grateful.
- You guys are unbelievable.

14:13.750 --> 14:16.875
I let you in my club,
you feel up my girls,

14:16.958 --> 14:18.458
and now, you're gonna
hand me this plate of shit!

14:18.541 --> 14:20.916
- Look, I can't change
the science, Dr. Buss.
- Science?

14:21.000 --> 14:22.416
I am a fucking scientist.

14:22.500 --> 14:23.666
Roger Bannister.

14:23.750 --> 14:24.916
Now, there's a scientist!

14:25.000 --> 14:27.166
The Wright Brothers!
Those are scientists!

14:27.250 --> 14:29.958
Not you, pal!
You're Doctor Fucking No!

14:30.041 --> 14:32.375
If it was up to you,
planes wouldn't fly!

14:32.458 --> 14:34.125
They'd fucking crash and burn!

14:34.208 --> 14:36.291
And nobody'd be running
a four-minute mile

14:36.375 --> 14:38.791
'cause you'd be telling
them it's impossible!

14:38.875 --> 14:41.041
You're Dr. Fucking No!

14:41.125 --> 14:43.291
And you're standing in
a house that yes built!

14:43.375 --> 14:44.833
So, let me tell you something!

14:44.916 --> 14:47.458
- You can take that no-can-do...

14:47.541 --> 14:49.333
and get the fuck out!

14:55.125 --> 14:57.250
Fuck. What the fuck
are you lookin' at?!

15:15.041 --> 15:18.208
<i>Yeah. Can you go get</i>
<i>Cookie? It's Earvin.</i>

15:18.291 --> 15:21.000
<i>She's not here. I guess</i>
<i>she's at class or something.</i>

15:21.083 --> 15:23.916
Which you mean ain't there?
Cookie ain't got no class today.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.041
<i>Just tell her Rhonda</i>
<i>lost the baby,</i>

15:26.125 --> 15:27.916
<i>and I got proof anyway</i>
<i>it wasn't mine.</i>

15:28.000 --> 15:30.291
I'll be sure to let
her know you called.

15:31.916 --> 15:33.541
- You do that.

15:47.583 --> 15:50.166
<i>It's always been you and me.</i>

15:51.125 --> 15:52.416
Hasn't it?

15:52.500 --> 15:54.541
<i>Against all comers.</i>

15:54.625 --> 15:56.291
<i>Tuesday's the home opener.</i>

15:56.375 --> 15:58.250
<i>I'm gonna send</i>
<i>Jeanie with the car.</i>

15:58.333 --> 16:00.208
- <i> I wouldn't miss it.</i>

16:01.833 --> 16:03.875
- Love you, Ma.
- Love you.

16:09.583 --> 16:11.541
Lame. Lame! Tell her!

16:11.625 --> 16:14.666
- What?
- That she's being
a fucking idiot.

16:14.750 --> 16:16.333
That's more something
you would say, Linda.

16:16.416 --> 16:19.041
I'm being serious.
This is your job

16:19.125 --> 16:21.583
and it's in the classifieds.

16:21.666 --> 16:24.166
I already told you,
this isn't my job.

16:24.250 --> 16:26.291
- That's full-time.
- So are you.

16:26.375 --> 16:28.916
Why? Just because you
don't get paid for it?

16:29.000 --> 16:30.208
You need to talk to him.

16:30.291 --> 16:32.583
You need to tell him you
deserve this, or you watch.

16:32.666 --> 16:34.291
We'll have 60 people
lining up here Monday morning,

16:34.375 --> 16:36.125
waiting to take
what should be yours,

16:36.208 --> 16:37.583
and every one of them
dumber than Lon.

16:37.666 --> 16:39.333
It's not necessary to
say things like that.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.916
No. He needs me at home.

16:44.833 --> 16:46.500
I'm helping Grandma.

16:46.583 --> 16:48.250
If he thought I should
have taken the job,

16:48.333 --> 16:51.791
- he would have said so.
- Bullshit. Tell her.

16:51.875 --> 16:54.208
It kind of is.

16:59.958 --> 17:01.625
Jean-bean! There you are!

17:01.708 --> 17:02.750
Come on.
We're going on a mission.

17:02.833 --> 17:06.041
We're gonna kidnap Grandma.
Let's go.

17:06.125 --> 17:07.875
- Come on! Let's go! Giddy-up!

17:07.958 --> 17:09.750
Right now! Grab your stuff.

17:11.708 --> 17:13.208
I'll be back.

17:13.291 --> 17:15.166
I just wanna see
what it's about.

17:23.125 --> 17:25.625
This is insane.

17:25.708 --> 17:28.458
Oh, hogwash. This place
is easier to break into

17:28.541 --> 17:29.791
than a French girl's panties.

17:29.875 --> 17:31.166
We used to come here
every summer.

17:31.250 --> 17:33.791
- Practically
own the place.

17:33.875 --> 17:36.666
Mary Pickford would hit
the Riviera, and we'd pop in

17:36.750 --> 17:39.291
- for a picnic by the pool.
- We're all going
to end up in jail.

17:39.375 --> 17:40.916
Only if we let him
do the picking.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.916
Come on, let an expert
go to work.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.208
Goodness sakes,
you've been rich too long.

17:45.291 --> 17:48.041
- You forgot how to be useful.
- I learned how
to pay for things.

17:48.125 --> 17:51.041
Well, once you blow your
wad on basketball, what then?

17:51.125 --> 17:53.000
Get over here, missy.
You need to learn this.

17:53.083 --> 17:54.750
Girl needs something
to fall back on

17:54.833 --> 17:57.375
- when boys can't hold their own.

17:57.458 --> 18:00.083
- Oh!
- Wow!

18:00.166 --> 18:02.250
- You still got it.
- Home again, home again,

18:02.333 --> 18:04.708
- jiggety-jig.

18:04.791 --> 18:08.958
- I don't feel
good about this.
- Oh. Come on, baby.

18:11.416 --> 18:12.666
Hush up, hush up.

18:12.750 --> 18:14.458
He loved this pool so much

18:14.541 --> 18:16.458
that he would drop his drawers

18:16.541 --> 18:19.666
before we even got
the gate open!

18:19.750 --> 18:21.666
And then, he would take off

18:21.750 --> 18:23.083
across the lawn,

18:23.166 --> 18:25.375
trying to beat the Rottweilers
who were chasing

18:25.458 --> 18:27.666
his little ding-a-ling
the whole way, like a...

18:27.750 --> 18:30.500
- ...rabbit at the track!

18:32.875 --> 18:34.666
You see that? One false move,

18:34.750 --> 18:37.208
and then you wouldn't
be here!

18:37.291 --> 18:40.291
It was really scary.

18:40.375 --> 18:42.291
- Man, you two had a lot of fun.
- Mm, yeah.

18:42.375 --> 18:44.833
Being poor is a blast
until it's time to eat.

18:44.916 --> 18:47.000
Oh, we ate just fine.

18:47.083 --> 18:48.500
When he didn't tip the grift.

18:48.583 --> 18:51.458
He had this, this...

18:51.541 --> 18:53.375
uh, this left eyebrow of his

18:53.458 --> 18:56.458
that just twitched like crazy
whenever he was bluffing.

18:56.541 --> 18:58.833
He had no,
no poker face whatsoever.

18:58.916 --> 19:00.291
You should know that.

19:00.375 --> 19:01.958
Giving away all my secrets.

19:02.041 --> 19:03.541
Well, I never played, so...

19:03.625 --> 19:05.875
What?

19:05.958 --> 19:07.416
What kind of father are you?

19:07.500 --> 19:10.875
A good one that doesn't teach
his children how to gamble!

19:10.958 --> 19:12.500
Wait,
you have never taught her

19:12.583 --> 19:15.541
to play a single hand of cards?

19:15.625 --> 19:17.000
Only Monopoly.

19:17.083 --> 19:19.750
- You know what? You just
didn't wanna lose your shirt.
- Yeah.

19:20.375 --> 19:21.916
Buss women,

19:22.000 --> 19:24.291
we have cards in the blood.

19:24.375 --> 19:25.541
- I should point out

19:25.625 --> 19:28.000
that it was you that
stopped playing with me.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.416
Breaks my heart to see you cry.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.291
- Right.

19:31.375 --> 19:35.125
Well, Dad, I mean, don't you
have a deck with you?

19:35.208 --> 19:36.583
Huh?

19:36.666 --> 19:39.208
Alright, well...
are you chicken?

19:39.291 --> 19:41.916
- Them's fighting words, kiddo!

19:42.000 --> 19:44.541
- I got 'em right here!
Oh no, no, no.

19:44.625 --> 19:46.083
I love playing cards
with people

19:46.166 --> 19:47.875
that don't know how to play.
Trust me.

19:47.958 --> 19:49.291
No, I think you're afraid.

19:49.375 --> 19:51.083
- Come on, deal 'em out.
- What do you want?

19:51.166 --> 19:54.375
- Play Texas Hold 'Em.
- Okay, Texas Hold 'Em.
You got it.

19:54.458 --> 19:56.791
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I want to cut those.

20:11.541 --> 20:13.375
He's proud of you.

20:16.458 --> 20:19.333
I know.

20:19.416 --> 20:20.750
No, you don't know

20:20.833 --> 20:23.291
because he's lousy
at showing it.

20:23.375 --> 20:26.125
He learned that from his mother.

20:26.208 --> 20:27.791
But, he is.

20:32.250 --> 20:34.375
There's this job.

20:35.958 --> 20:38.083
And I know I can do it.

20:39.333 --> 20:41.833
I know I'd be great at it.

20:43.250 --> 20:45.041
I want it.

20:45.125 --> 20:47.916
What are you waiting for?

20:48.000 --> 20:51.291
Well, he just needs my
help right now with, um...

20:53.041 --> 20:54.583
Me.

20:56.833 --> 20:59.125
Wow.

20:59.208 --> 21:01.916
I don't think you'll have
to wait too long.

21:06.166 --> 21:08.708
Don't talk like that, okay?

21:08.791 --> 21:12.458
Don't let him make excuses.

21:15.083 --> 21:18.041
I have given
my whole life to men.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.125
Fathers, husbands, sons.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.958
Has its upsides.

21:26.041 --> 21:28.625
It's hard to be out there
all on your own.

21:29.875 --> 21:32.208
I fell on my ass a few times.

21:32.833 --> 21:34.708
I gave up.

21:34.791 --> 21:37.916
But, you're better than me.

21:40.708 --> 21:42.833
You're a good girl, Jeanie.

21:44.708 --> 21:47.125
Don't be too good.

21:58.125 --> 22:01.625
Okay then. I just want to thank
you for taking the time, Jack.

22:01.708 --> 22:04.333
All I have to give these days.

22:04.416 --> 22:06.708
Until you give
my whistle back to me.

22:06.791 --> 22:08.708
It's not my call.

22:08.791 --> 22:11.500
- Just lending a hand.
- But, uh...

22:13.458 --> 22:16.583
You, you will be having
a word with Buss?

22:16.666 --> 22:18.750
I'm telling you
I'm ready, Jerry.

22:18.833 --> 22:20.375
Ready for the playoffs.

22:20.458 --> 22:23.000
Oh, I'll be putting
a four-letter one, or two.

22:23.083 --> 22:24.708
You can count on that shit.

22:24.791 --> 22:26.125
I know I'm supposed
to be fucking retired,

22:26.208 --> 22:28.541
but he's got me out here
untangling his fucking knots.

22:29.458 --> 22:30.541
Hm...

22:32.000 --> 22:33.958
You remember the way out,
don't you?

22:37.125 --> 22:38.500
Oh, you bet.

22:39.708 --> 22:42.000
Uh, I didn't get hit
on the head that hard.

22:42.083 --> 22:45.125
Thanks, Jerry,
I'll see you soon.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.750
He'll be putting in a word.

23:05.833 --> 23:08.375
Goddamn it, Jack. You pushed.

23:08.458 --> 23:10.916
You pushed too hard.

23:22.750 --> 23:24.583
Uh, excuse me, sir?

23:58.291 --> 23:59.375
Oh...

24:03.416 --> 24:05.625
You alright there, Coach?

24:11.958 --> 24:14.250
Uh, where am I? Uh...

24:14.333 --> 24:17.208
I got turned around.
I-- Uh, where's the exit?

24:18.041 --> 24:20.041
It's right there, man.

24:20.125 --> 24:22.791
R-right.

24:29.625 --> 24:31.208
Hm.

24:40.875 --> 24:42.875
Sure you don't want
some hair of the dog?

24:42.958 --> 24:45.250
- That might go down well.

24:45.333 --> 24:47.375
Good morning.

24:47.458 --> 24:50.000
- Where's all my money at?

24:50.083 --> 24:52.041
Some night.

24:52.125 --> 24:55.041
Yeah, just like
old times.

24:55.625 --> 24:57.333
Yep.

24:57.416 --> 24:59.083
You still...

24:59.166 --> 25:00.833
pass out first.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.416
Well,

25:02.500 --> 25:04.416
Mr. Seagram's
had his way with me.

25:08.333 --> 25:11.833
Oh. You two...

25:11.916 --> 25:13.666
go back without me.

25:14.458 --> 25:16.583
I'll just... die here

25:16.666 --> 25:20.208
- and haunt the place.

25:20.291 --> 25:24.208
How about you
live here instead?

25:24.291 --> 25:27.208
You know, the offer stands.
I can get this place
on the cheap.

25:29.500 --> 25:33.166
You have a habit of
following your heart.

25:35.041 --> 25:37.833
- And you hate that about me.

25:37.916 --> 25:40.625
Just jealous maybe.

25:46.458 --> 25:47.791
Come here.

25:51.166 --> 25:53.166
Hm.

25:53.958 --> 25:56.083
Oh...

25:56.875 --> 25:58.500
I remember...

26:00.416 --> 26:02.750
the smile...

26:02.833 --> 26:04.958
you had on your face...

26:06.125 --> 26:09.916
first time we broke
into this place.

26:11.208 --> 26:13.333
And you laid back

26:13.416 --> 26:16.291
on the nice green grass...

26:17.916 --> 26:21.041
felt the California sun...

26:25.458 --> 26:28.708
I haven't seen that smile.

26:30.833 --> 26:33.458
Not for a very long time.

26:45.625 --> 26:47.541
Well, you stick around
to see us win this thing,

26:47.625 --> 26:49.791
you can see it then.

26:52.708 --> 26:54.291
You promise?

27:13.083 --> 27:14.625
Jean-bean.

27:18.750 --> 27:20.875
- Good morning.
- You ready?

27:21.791 --> 27:24.875
Because, you know, if my boss

27:24.958 --> 27:26.750
finds out that I was arrested,

27:26.833 --> 27:28.875
I think I might get fired.

27:28.958 --> 27:30.833
Alright.

27:32.083 --> 27:34.583
Come on, Mom. Let's go.

27:38.916 --> 27:41.625
Ma. Is she sleeping?

27:43.166 --> 27:44.958
Ma, we gotta go.

27:46.083 --> 27:47.416
Ma?

27:49.458 --> 27:50.833
Ma?

27:51.583 --> 27:54.250
Hey. Hey, Ma?

27:55.500 --> 27:57.916
Oh no. Shit.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.250
Sh-- Ma?

27:59.333 --> 28:01.250
- Dad?
- Ma, can you hear me?

28:01.333 --> 28:04.875
- Get my-- Get the keys out
of my jacket. Start the car!
- Okay!

28:04.958 --> 28:06.291
Ma, can you hear me?!

28:07.333 --> 28:08.291
Ma?

28:08.375 --> 28:10.250
Oh fuck, come on!

28:13.125 --> 28:15.500
Got your fucking pros,
got cons, fucking coaches.

28:15.583 --> 28:18.208
You get shit-store Shakespeare
on the one hand,

28:18.291 --> 28:20.541
and a limping fucking
Napoleon on the other.

28:21.583 --> 28:23.500
Fuck am I supposed
to do with that?

28:23.583 --> 28:24.750
Fuck.

28:26.291 --> 28:27.708
He can't really be
thinking about

28:27.791 --> 28:29.875
giving the team
back to McKinney.
Fucking ridiculous.

28:29.958 --> 28:31.375
Maurice found him
sitting on his ass

28:31.458 --> 28:33.875
like some fucking kid
who lost his mommy.

28:33.958 --> 28:35.083
Yeah.

28:35.166 --> 28:37.500
I noticed it with his
memory back in Philly.

28:37.583 --> 28:40.000
I just figured
he was better now.

28:40.083 --> 28:42.458
Well, he's not.
Not by a long shot.

28:42.541 --> 28:44.166
And if we don't speak up,

28:44.250 --> 28:46.583
he'll be having a conniption
in the finals.

28:46.666 --> 28:48.166
On the sidelines with our team.

28:48.250 --> 28:50.250
Well, I can't.

28:50.333 --> 28:51.291
Why not?

28:51.375 --> 28:52.708
Because my best friend
in the world

28:52.791 --> 28:55.791
may never talk to me again.
But at least...

28:55.875 --> 28:58.000
right now, I can still
look into the mirror

28:58.083 --> 28:59.875
and know that all we
ever did was do our job.

28:59.958 --> 29:01.708
That's what this is.

29:01.791 --> 29:03.958
Our job.
This squad.

29:04.041 --> 29:05.833
The guys who work
their hearts out.

29:05.916 --> 29:07.958
This is their life, too.

29:08.041 --> 29:10.250
I'll do it.

29:10.333 --> 29:13.125
I tell West what happened.
What he does with it,

29:13.208 --> 29:14.500
that's up to him.

29:14.583 --> 29:16.500
Hands clean. Hm?

29:16.583 --> 29:18.666
- Pat... Pat.

29:27.916 --> 29:28.833
Fuck.

29:30.333 --> 29:34.625
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck.

29:34.708 --> 29:36.750
- Well, I can't.
- Thank God.

29:36.833 --> 29:39.125
- We did everything right.
That ought to be enough.
- We did.

29:39.208 --> 29:41.000
- It should be.
- I mean, if they're

29:41.083 --> 29:43.375
too fucking blind
to see it, fuck 'em.

29:43.458 --> 29:45.333
Fuck West, fuck Buss.

29:45.416 --> 29:47.208
Fuck 'em all.

29:48.208 --> 29:51.125
Fuck me.

29:56.625 --> 29:59.208
It's looking like
a hemorrhagic stroke.

29:59.291 --> 30:01.250
We've got her on medication
to slow the bleeding

30:01.333 --> 30:04.083
and to relieve pressure
on her brain, but,

30:04.166 --> 30:06.875
right now, the machines
are breathing for her.

30:07.958 --> 30:09.708
What can we do?

30:10.583 --> 30:12.208
Keep her comfortable.

30:13.166 --> 30:15.500
As long as you decide.

30:21.958 --> 30:23.083
I wouldn't miss--

30:41.291 --> 30:43.166
Come on. Let's sit down.

30:52.125 --> 30:54.166
<i>Last game of the regular</i>
<i>season for these Lakers,</i>

30:54.250 --> 30:55.916
<i>and, right now,</i>
<i>everything is gravy.</i>

30:56.000 --> 30:58.083
<i>A win tonight locks in</i>
<i>the top seed in the West</i>

30:58.166 --> 31:00.375
<i>as they head into</i>
<i>their playoff run.</i>

31:02.291 --> 31:03.416
- Jerry.
- Bill.

31:03.500 --> 31:06.416
You hear about
the boss' mother?

31:06.500 --> 31:08.916
Some fuckin' timing.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.541
Well, thanks for helping
with the big decision.

31:11.625 --> 31:13.708
You look good in
the front office.

31:13.791 --> 31:15.416
Might consider that.

31:15.500 --> 31:19.125
Feels more like I'm sitting
in a hangman's chair.

31:19.208 --> 31:21.291
Winner gets a shot at the title.

31:21.375 --> 31:23.625
Loser gets the pain in the neck.

31:25.375 --> 31:27.833
What the fuck are we
doing this for, Bill, really?

31:30.958 --> 31:34.416
You know, I graduated
high school on a Monday,

31:34.500 --> 31:36.291
married my sweetheart
on Tuesday,

31:36.375 --> 31:39.416
and I shipped out to
the Navy on Wednesday night.

31:39.500 --> 31:43.583
Spent the next two years
on a boat in the Pacific.

31:43.666 --> 31:45.750
And once a week,

31:45.833 --> 31:49.000
the Armed Forces Network
would put a... a game on.

31:49.083 --> 31:51.666
One game.
You know, baseball,
basketball, jai alai.

31:51.750 --> 31:54.458
It didn't matter.
We'd all crowd
into the barracks.

31:56.333 --> 31:58.333
Just a bunch of kids,

31:58.416 --> 32:01.458
playing hide-and-seek
with death.

32:01.541 --> 32:04.375
I used to wonder, you know,
in the face of all that...

32:05.958 --> 32:09.666
how any of us can think
about a fucking game.

32:11.541 --> 32:13.750
It's a good question.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.125
But then, it hit me.

32:20.833 --> 32:23.291
How can you not?

32:42.916 --> 32:44.583
- Yeah?

32:45.291 --> 32:46.666
How is she?

32:48.500 --> 32:50.375
Oh, I'm, I'm sorry, Jerry.

32:52.958 --> 32:56.291
Yeah. It's alright.
Come on in.

32:56.375 --> 32:58.166
Appreciate you coming by.

32:59.500 --> 33:01.125
I brought you these.

33:02.375 --> 33:04.166
- You know, it's...

33:04.250 --> 33:06.958
It's not a good time,
I can always come back and...

33:07.041 --> 33:09.083
Well, that depends.

33:11.583 --> 33:14.166
Are they gonna
postpone the playoffs?

33:16.666 --> 33:18.083
Probably not, no.

33:18.166 --> 33:19.625
So, there's no time
like the present.

33:19.708 --> 33:22.208
Who is my coach, Jerry?

33:23.833 --> 33:25.083
Well, I thought about it.

33:27.708 --> 33:29.583
I did. I spoke to
everyone involved,

33:29.666 --> 33:31.958
and I feel strongly that...

33:37.583 --> 33:39.250
I'm damn lucky I'm not you.

33:39.333 --> 33:42.250
- No. There is no
right answer here.

33:42.333 --> 33:44.666
There's no wrong one either,
and you could be a hero or heel.

33:44.750 --> 33:48.583
I'll be fucking damned
if I or anyone else
can fault you on that.

33:48.666 --> 33:50.291
Whichever way you go.

33:51.291 --> 33:53.333
And you can quote me on that.

33:54.416 --> 33:57.000
When did I become
the executioner?

33:57.083 --> 33:59.375
Don't I have employees for that?

33:59.458 --> 34:01.833
Well, if it's any
consolation, you'll, uh,

34:01.916 --> 34:04.333
you'll be giving one of
these two the gift of life.

34:04.416 --> 34:05.958
Unless, of course,
they crap out and lose it

34:06.041 --> 34:07.583
to the fucking Celtics,
in which case,

34:07.666 --> 34:09.958
- I'll kill him myself.
- Come on, Jerry.

34:10.041 --> 34:13.041
- You're not even
gonna give me a hint?
- Oh...

34:13.125 --> 34:15.208
I know you're
thinking something!

34:15.291 --> 34:17.958
What got you this far?

34:18.041 --> 34:20.208
Yeah, you're richer than I am.

34:21.041 --> 34:23.000
You must have a gut.

34:23.083 --> 34:25.583
An instinct. Huh?

34:30.916 --> 34:34.958
- I followed my heart.
- There you go.

34:35.041 --> 34:37.875
Which way is it
beating this time?

35:03.166 --> 35:04.500
- Jack?
- What?

35:04.583 --> 35:06.041
- Where do we live?
- Huh?

35:06.125 --> 35:08.958
I said, where do we live?
Our address.

35:09.041 --> 35:10.791
Or do you forget?

35:10.875 --> 35:13.625
We lived here about half a year.
You need a hint?

35:14.958 --> 35:16.166
I found this in your pocket.

35:16.250 --> 35:18.000
It's a phone book page.

35:18.083 --> 35:20.583
- Fucking phone book page.
- I-I went for a jog--

35:20.666 --> 35:23.291
- Because you can't
remember where we live.
- I got turned around

35:23.375 --> 35:25.791
- because this goddamn town
doesn't make any sense.
- You can't remember...

35:25.875 --> 35:27.916
Are you really going
through my goddamn pockets,
now, Cranny?

35:28.041 --> 35:30.375
You're not even gonna tell me.
You're pushing it too hard!

35:30.458 --> 35:33.125
- I'm not stepping back,
Cranny. Not now.
- Jack...

35:33.208 --> 35:35.375
I'm too young to spend
the rest of my life

35:35.458 --> 35:36.875
wiping dribble off your chin!

35:36.958 --> 35:39.666
I think you like me being sick.

35:39.750 --> 35:43.791
- I think you liked me needing
you for once, an invalid.
- For once?

35:43.875 --> 35:45.208
Let me do my work!

35:45.291 --> 35:46.833
Get out, just let me do my--

35:50.125 --> 35:52.166
Who packed the boxes?

35:52.250 --> 35:55.666
Every time you get a job,
who has to tell the boys

35:55.750 --> 35:57.000
and break their hearts

35:57.083 --> 35:59.041
while Daddy gets
to stay the hero? Huh?

35:59.125 --> 36:00.666
- Cranny...
- I sat up

36:00.750 --> 36:02.791
every night in that hospital,

36:02.875 --> 36:04.875
so I could pound your chest

36:04.958 --> 36:08.291
every time your
heart stopped beating.
I did that.

36:08.375 --> 36:09.791
Yeah, I did that!

36:09.875 --> 36:13.750
And I didn't do it for
the fucking LA Lakers!

36:13.833 --> 36:17.416
For once! Fucking idiot.

36:17.500 --> 36:19.958
- Cranny...

36:23.208 --> 36:25.208
Can I help you?

36:27.333 --> 36:30.083
Special delivery
for Jack McKinney.

36:32.958 --> 36:34.750
Cranny!

36:34.833 --> 36:37.041
Can you come sign
for this, please?

36:38.958 --> 36:41.166
- Sorry. Hang on just a sec.

36:41.250 --> 36:43.958
- Jack...
- She'll be right here.

36:44.041 --> 36:45.625
Cranny!

36:45.708 --> 36:48.375
Can you sign for this guy?

36:48.458 --> 36:50.166
Dr. Buss.

36:51.458 --> 36:52.833
This guy,

36:52.916 --> 36:55.458
acting like he don't
recognize me.

36:55.541 --> 36:58.416
Always messing around.
What a kidder.

36:58.500 --> 37:01.125
- Here, I'll get us some glasses.

37:01.208 --> 37:02.416
Oh no, no. That's for you two.

37:02.500 --> 37:04.500
You drink in good health.
I got to run.

37:04.583 --> 37:06.958
I just came by to drop that off.
But, give my girl a call,

37:07.041 --> 37:11.083
come by in the morning,
and we'll sit down, we'll...

37:11.166 --> 37:13.708
work out this whole thing.
You know?

37:13.791 --> 37:16.041
You're looking good, Jack!
Good to see you.

37:25.208 --> 37:26.750
No bike ridin'!

37:42.250 --> 37:43.458
Fuck.

38:35.583 --> 38:37.666
It's the right call.

38:39.541 --> 38:41.791
Shut the blinds in there.

38:45.416 --> 38:47.833
Fuck. Bill's in there.

38:47.916 --> 38:51.500
They're going with McKinney.
I fucking knew it.

38:51.583 --> 38:52.958
- Okay.
- Fuck.

38:53.041 --> 38:55.625
- What? What? What?

38:57.750 --> 38:59.666
- Hey.
- Man...

39:27.416 --> 39:29.750
Can you get us to
the Promised Land?

39:32.333 --> 39:34.000
Of course, yeah.

39:34.083 --> 39:36.208
If there's no, uh,
bad blood with Jack,

39:36.291 --> 39:39.333
- we can stay on
and help him out.
- No.

39:39.416 --> 39:41.083
Not with Jack.

39:44.875 --> 39:46.000
We got it.

39:46.083 --> 39:48.000
- We got it.

39:50.333 --> 39:51.916
Yes.

39:52.541 --> 39:54.041
Absolutely.

39:55.208 --> 39:56.833
Don't fuck it up.

40:41.166 --> 40:43.000
<i>Nixon blazing down the court</i>

40:43.083 --> 40:45.041
<i>looking for an open man,</i>
<i>and there it is,</i>

40:45.125 --> 40:46.333
<i>the lob to Cooper.</i>
<i>Shazam!</i>

40:46.416 --> 40:48.125
<i>Just beautiful.</i>

40:48.208 --> 40:50.416
<i>Lakers besting the Suns</i>
<i>in this best of seven</i>

40:50.500 --> 40:52.291
<i>and it's been</i>

40:52.375 --> 40:54.958
<i>Lakers on the run.</i>
<i>Magic, beautiful pass</i>
<i>to Nixon! Oh my!</i>

40:55.041 --> 40:57.166
<i>Oh, showtime, folks!</i>

40:57.250 --> 40:59.541
<i>To Cooper. Slam dunk!</i>
<i>Just gorgeous.</i>

40:59.625 --> 41:01.958
<i>Remarkable passing</i>
<i>by the Lakers.</i>

41:02.041 --> 41:03.625
<i>Ha, ha!</i>

41:05.583 --> 41:08.708
<i>And the Lakers ran away</i>
<i>with this conference semi,</i>

41:08.791 --> 41:09.833

41:09.916 --> 41:11.708

41:29.333 --> 41:31.166
Love you.

41:31.250 --> 41:33.125
Bye-bye. Love you!

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
God, she is pretty.

41:42.083 --> 41:45.583
... Spencer.

41:45.666 --> 41:46.958
<i>Magic passes to Kareem.</i>

41:47.041 --> 41:48.583
<i>He's pivoting,</i>

41:48.666 --> 41:50.083
<i>Gets some help from</i>
<i>Haywood with a pick.</i>

41:50.166 --> 41:53.041
<i>And he lays it in.</i>
<i>Snug as a bug in a rug.</i>

Five! Four!

42:20.125 --> 42:22.875
Three! Two! One!

42:22.958 --> 42:24.583
- <i> And it's all over,</i>

42:24.666 --> 42:28.291

<i>and wait for a date</i>
<i>with the doctor.</i>

43:28.208 --> 43:30.125
All we care about is that
the boys in Forum Blue

43:30.208 --> 43:31.916
will be there,
and look at 'em celebrating.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.291
Boy, they sure have earned it.

43:33.375 --> 43:35.500
You made me believe, baby.
You made me believe.

43:35.583 --> 43:37.833
<i>And look at Magic out there,</i>
<i>smile shining</i>

43:37.916 --> 43:40.083
<i>like the North Star,</i>
<i>and Dr. Buss,</i>
<i>our other rookie,</i>

43:40.166 --> 43:43.125
<i>must be somewhere</i>
<i>beaming just as bright.</i>

44:05.958 --> 44:09.166
<i>There it is. Philly puts</i>
<i>this one over the top.</i>

44:09.250 --> 44:11.958
<i>And folks dreaming</i>
<i>of a Boston-LA finals</i>

44:12.041 --> 44:14.000
<i>will have to wait another year.</i>

44:14.083 --> 44:16.333
<i>- The 76ers have...</i>
Here we go, fellas.

44:16.416 --> 44:18.125
Philly it is.

44:18.208 --> 44:19.375
Man, I wanted Boston.

44:19.458 --> 44:20.791
Then you a dumbass.

44:20.875 --> 44:22.750
<i>...right here on CBS.</i>

44:26.333 --> 44:27.875
<i>The Celtics have</i>
<i>the best record</i>

44:27.958 --> 44:29.333
<i>of any team</i>
<i>in the league...</i>

44:29.416 --> 44:31.750
Same time next year, asshole.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.125
You know it.

44:34.208 --> 44:35.750
<i>And young Larry Bird may be</i>

44:35.833 --> 44:37.375
<i>disappointed by the outcome,</i>

44:37.458 --> 44:40.791
<i>but after watching his</i>
<i>performance in this series,</i>

44:40.875 --> 44:44.000
<i>he gets my vote</i>
<i>for Rookie of the Year.</i>

44:44.083 --> 44:46.041
<i>Bird led scoring</i>
<i>through the playoffs...</i>

44:46.125 --> 44:48.791
We win it all,
you'll get your due.

44:48.875 --> 44:51.000
<i>...far beyond his age.</i>

44:52.541 --> 44:54.208
Hey, Cap?

44:55.166 --> 44:57.416
We got a situation.

45:03.583 --> 45:05.416
Spence?

45:05.500 --> 45:08.208
- What happened to you?
What's the matter?

45:10.375 --> 45:12.958
I fucked up...

45:13.041 --> 45:16.333
Just... I fucked up, Cap...

45:18.541 --> 45:20.541
I'm sorry...

45:21.750 --> 45:23.333
I fucked up...

45:24.875 --> 45:28.083
Okay. It's okay...

45:28.166 --> 45:31.208
I fucked up...

45:31.291 --> 45:33.916
I'm sorry...
- Aw, fuck.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.375
Goddammit, man.

45:36.458 --> 45:38.125
Man, I can't watch this shit.

45:38.208 --> 45:40.125
There's an institute
in Arizona.

45:40.208 --> 45:43.916
They specialize in something
called aversion therapy.

45:44.000 --> 45:47.583
Spencer would admit
himself after the season.

45:47.666 --> 45:51.083
He's promised me he'll
keep clean through the finals.

45:54.208 --> 45:56.250
If you let him stay.

46:00.958 --> 46:04.416
Look, he's our one true four.

46:04.500 --> 46:05.916
Alright, if we lose him,

46:06.000 --> 46:07.791
that's gonna put a whole
lot on Cap down low.

46:07.875 --> 46:09.250
We gonna need him
in the paint.

46:09.333 --> 46:11.250
Them Twin Towers they got,
Dawkins, Jones.

46:11.333 --> 46:13.791
- Leave them to Chones.
The brother has a problem.

46:13.875 --> 46:15.708
Can't just throw
him to the wolves.

46:15.791 --> 46:17.458
Maybe somebody can just
keep an eye on him.

46:17.541 --> 46:20.416
This is the pros,
not daycare.

46:20.500 --> 46:22.458
Look, Wood's only problem

46:22.541 --> 46:24.375
is that he's a selfish
motherfucker.

46:24.458 --> 46:28.500
All that African brother
Hotep bullshit?

46:28.583 --> 46:31.833
Look, bottom line,
dude's not strong.
He's weak.

46:31.916 --> 46:33.791
And if we let this
motherfucker stay on the team,

46:33.875 --> 46:36.166
then the rest of us
is weak, too.

46:42.166 --> 46:43.750
And you, Buck?

46:48.458 --> 46:50.083
I wanna win a ring.

46:51.250 --> 46:53.208
That's what matters to me.

46:53.291 --> 46:55.708
And I feel bad for dude

46:55.791 --> 46:59.291
if he ain't ready
for what's coming.

46:59.375 --> 47:03.041
But, great man told me winning
in this league takes being hard.

47:08.666 --> 47:09.833
Listen.

47:09.916 --> 47:11.666
He's your teammate.

47:12.583 --> 47:13.916
So, this is a team call.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.333
Let's put it to a vote.

47:24.166 --> 47:25.958
All for cutting Spencer.

47:31.750 --> 47:33.083
Mm-hmm.

47:43.166 --> 47:44.583
All opposed.

48:02.791 --> 48:04.625
White folk still white folking?

48:06.875 --> 48:09.083
I just left.

48:09.166 --> 48:10.291
Hm...

48:29.500 --> 48:31.291
You ever been to Mississippi?

48:32.166 --> 48:33.958
- Never.
- No?

48:34.041 --> 48:35.416
I came up there.

48:35.500 --> 48:37.541
Family of field hands.

48:37.625 --> 48:38.958
<i>They call it sharecropping,</i>

48:39.041 --> 48:40.916
but if there's a difference
between it and slavery,

48:41.000 --> 48:41.875
I ain't see it.

48:41.958 --> 48:44.250
I was born in a barn,

48:44.333 --> 48:46.166
on the same dirt...

48:47.166 --> 48:50.000
as the pigs and chickens.

48:50.083 --> 48:53.416
The only thing that separated
us from them was...

48:55.541 --> 48:57.875
these right here.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.166
<i>Extra bone in each finger.</i>

49:01.250 --> 49:02.583
My Auntie Harriet

49:02.666 --> 49:05.166
<i>seen 'em and went, "Wow."</i>
<i>Touching them, said, uh,</i>

49:05.250 --> 49:08.500
"That boy is blessed.
That boy gonna do some...

49:08.583 --> 49:11.291
That boy gonna do
some great things."

49:12.750 --> 49:14.833
But, along come...

49:14.916 --> 49:18.333
old man Quinn. Field boss.

49:18.416 --> 49:21.500
<i>High yellow nigga.</i>

49:21.583 --> 49:23.375
Quick sight, you'd
think he a-a cracker.

49:23.458 --> 49:25.875
But, he worse than one of 'em.

49:25.958 --> 49:29.291
Used to whistle with
his pinkies in his mouth.

49:30.625 --> 49:33.708
And just like that,
our backs was bent.

49:33.791 --> 49:36.166
Shit, I think
the first real sound

49:36.250 --> 49:38.416
I ever heard was a whistle.

49:40.625 --> 49:42.458
So, he seen my mama
and my auntie

49:42.541 --> 49:44.500
fussing over this
little newborn child

49:44.583 --> 49:48.208
with these fancy little
hands, and took to him.

49:49.583 --> 49:51.208
He knew better.

49:53.916 --> 49:57.333
"Hoo, that boy got
some long fingers!

49:58.083 --> 50:00.083
"Oo-hoo-hoo-wee!

50:00.166 --> 50:03.333
"He gonna make a special...

50:04.166 --> 50:06.000
cotton picker."

50:08.875 --> 50:09.791
Hm.

50:09.875 --> 50:12.625
My mama used to
tell us that story.

50:12.708 --> 50:16.416
Without-- Without
skipping a breath, say,

50:16.500 --> 50:18.500
"God love us."

50:22.125 --> 50:24.541
Now, it took me...

50:24.625 --> 50:26.583
some years

50:26.666 --> 50:29.166
to muster up
the gumption to ask...

50:31.166 --> 50:33.375
"Why...

50:33.458 --> 50:36.500
"are we on the bottom then?

50:36.583 --> 50:40.375
"Everywhere you see
a brown face,

50:40.458 --> 50:42.583
"you see tears on it.

50:44.083 --> 50:48.083
If He love us so damn much,
then why?"

50:51.791 --> 50:53.958
And you know what she said?

50:56.125 --> 50:58.958
"God loves them more."

51:05.500 --> 51:08.208
Yeah, I don't know if
it's-- if there's a God,

51:08.291 --> 51:12.625
I don't know.
But I do know there's a them.

51:12.708 --> 51:17.041
Same ones in that room
right now, deciding my fate!

51:22.791 --> 51:25.291
So, I guess I'll just
wait for the whistle.

51:38.291 --> 51:40.583
This time,
they left it up to us.

51:45.583 --> 51:47.958
The team already voted on it.

51:53.166 --> 51:54.750
Damn!

51:56.458 --> 51:59.583
Damn! Damn it. Damn!

52:09.791 --> 52:11.500
You did your best.

52:13.500 --> 52:15.625
I appreciate it, Cap.

52:23.375 --> 52:25.500
I was the deciding vote.

53:11.166 --> 53:12.250
There we go.

53:22.125 --> 53:23.583
- There we go.

53:26.791 --> 53:27.875
There we go.

53:31.500 --> 53:34.541
- Is that
what I think it is?

53:34.625 --> 53:38.000
Oh hey, Cap.
Been practicing your skyhook.

53:38.083 --> 53:40.541
Way I figure, be seeing
more time in the post

53:40.625 --> 53:43.625
against Philly,
so better have a go-to.

53:48.000 --> 53:51.916
That is not a skyhook.
- Ain't that bad.

53:53.291 --> 53:55.958
Well, why ain't
you show me then?

53:56.041 --> 53:59.333
- Skyhook isn't just
any other shot.

54:00.375 --> 54:01.708
To master it,

54:01.791 --> 54:03.500
a player needs to comprehend

54:03.583 --> 54:04.916
a very important principle.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.375
And what principle is that?

54:06.458 --> 54:09.583
Isolation. Come over here
and play a little defense.

54:09.666 --> 54:12.208
See, when you're the big man,

54:12.291 --> 54:15.000
everybody wants a piece of you.

54:15.083 --> 54:17.666
The skyhook shuts them out.

54:17.750 --> 54:19.166
It turns your body into a wall,

54:19.250 --> 54:22.250
beyond which they can't reach
or even see your face,

54:22.333 --> 54:26.000
which means
they can't predict you.

54:26.083 --> 54:29.333
So, on your own time,
when you're good and ready,

54:29.416 --> 54:31.541
you can leave
their world behind.

54:33.083 --> 54:35.333
You leave the world?

54:35.416 --> 54:37.000
You elevate above it.

54:39.500 --> 54:42.125
Until you're completely
and totally...

54:44.541 --> 54:46.916
- ...alone.

54:47.000 --> 54:50.166
<i>And all they get</i>
<i>to do is watch.</i>

54:50.250 --> 54:52.125
Damn, Cap.

54:52.208 --> 54:55.000
You some kind of poet
or somethin'.

54:55.083 --> 54:56.541
That shit deep.

54:56.625 --> 54:57.875
Alright, let's work on it.

54:57.958 --> 54:59.958
I can't have you fucking up
my shot on the world stage.

55:00.041 --> 55:02.583
Come on, get that
arm up straight,

55:02.666 --> 55:03.875
like the Statue of Liberty.

55:03.958 --> 55:05.458
It's the most elegant finish

55:05.541 --> 55:08.250
in all of sports.

55:08.333 --> 55:10.208
Right on.

55:12.625 --> 55:14.666
- Hey! Sprinkles!

55:15.625 --> 55:16.541
Hey!

55:16.625 --> 55:18.791
- Yeah, that's right.

55:19.750 --> 55:21.500
Wood, Wood, Wood.

55:21.583 --> 55:23.000
What the fuck, brother?

55:23.083 --> 55:26.208
Congrats on the Finals, man.
Time to get that shiny ring, eh?

55:26.291 --> 55:28.708
You still got that magnum?

55:28.791 --> 55:29.958
Oh, man, I got...

55:30.041 --> 55:32.875
I got lots of guns.
I got a bazooka.

55:32.958 --> 55:35.000
I don't care what you use,

55:35.083 --> 55:38.000
as long as it works.

55:38.083 --> 55:41.500
Sure, man. Yeah, right on.
Love to do that for a friend.

55:41.583 --> 55:43.375
You just say the word.

55:43.458 --> 55:45.250
Who do you want me to kill?

55:47.291 --> 55:48.791
The Lakers.
