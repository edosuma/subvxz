ONLY IF I GET TO LEAD.

16:57.130 --> 17:00.300
THIS ONE'S FOR YOU, ZADY.

17:00.340 --> 17:02.270
GIVE HIM THE FUNK, BOYS!

17:04.340 --> 17:06.210
AAH!

17:10.650 --> 17:13.520
PLAY THAT SONG
WITH THE FUNKY BEAT,

17:13.550 --> 17:15.320
AND BEAT 'EM SILLY, BABIES!

17:21.420 --> 17:24.190
I'M IN THE GROOVE,
BOBBLE. HIT ME!

17:32.340 --> 17:35.740
NICE SHOT
WITH THE GLUCO-GEL, TECH.

17:35.770 --> 17:37.340
NOW, BOOTES,
YOU'LL BE SINGING

17:37.370 --> 17:39.640
ANOTHER TUNE
WHERE YOU'RE GOING,

17:39.680 --> 17:42.710
TO THE HOKEY-POKEY.

17:42.750 --> 17:44.210
WHAT'S THIS?

17:44.250 --> 17:47.880
Lexi: MANNEQUINS

17:47.920 --> 17:49.720
Man: HERE'S HOW, LOONATICS.

18:03.830 --> 18:05.230
ZODAVIA!

18:37.600 --> 18:40.270
ZODAVIA.

18:40.300 --> 18:41.770
SHE'S A HOLOGRAM!

18:41.800 --> 18:43.310
WHOO-HOO! HEH HEH HEH!

18:43.340 --> 18:46.410
LET'S MAKE
SOME FUNKY MUSIC, BOYS!

18:57.790 --> 19:01.560
BANDITS!

19:01.590 --> 19:03.860
I AM THE BOOTES!

19:03.890 --> 19:05.560
LOVE TO STAY AND RAP,

19:05.590 --> 19:08.900
BUT, UH, GOT ANOTHER GIG
UPTOWN, BOBBLES.

19:08.930 --> 19:11.730
THANKS FOR THE STRINGS,
HAIRBALL.

19:18.240 --> 19:22.450
Bootes: GOOD NIGHT,
AND THANK YOU, BOBBLES.

19:28.380 --> 19:30.690
THANK YOU
AND GOOD NIGHT, LOONATICS!

19:37.960 --> 19:41.930
MY...ENERGY IS--

19:41.960 --> 19:44.370
GOING...GOING...

19:44.400 --> 19:49.710
GONE, THANKS TO MY TECHNO-WACKO
MUSICAL GENIUS.

19:49.740 --> 19:51.910
NOW, TO DRAIN YOUR POWER

19:51.940 --> 19:53.940
INTO MY COSMIC GUITAR!

20:02.320 --> 20:05.720
BUT...WHY?

20:05.750 --> 20:07.660
YOU NEVER PAID
ANY ATTENTION TO ME

20:07.690 --> 20:09.390
BACK ON FRELENG.

20:09.430 --> 20:13.830
BUT MAYBE YOU'LL PAY
ATTENTION TO ME NOW, ZADY.

20:13.860 --> 20:17.300
OH! RUPES OBERON?

20:17.330 --> 20:18.830
HEH HEH HEH!

20:18.870 --> 20:23.970
SO YOU DO REMEMBER?

20:24.010 --> 20:27.680
YOU WERE ALWAYS SO BUSY
HANGING WITH THE ELITE,

20:27.710 --> 20:31.480
ALWAYS OBSESSED
WITH GLOBAL GALAXY ISSUES.

20:31.510 --> 20:33.980
ALL I WANTED WAS TO BECOME
A MEMBER OF YOUR COURT

20:34.020 --> 20:35.850
AND TO SERVE YOU.

20:35.880 --> 20:38.490
I EVEN BROUGHT YOU
A PRESENT.

20:38.520 --> 20:42.560
FOR YOU, MY LADY.

20:46.460 --> 20:50.470
I WANTED IT TO BE FRELENG'S
NEW NATIONAL ANTHEM,

20:50.500 --> 20:53.770
SO I COULD
BE REMEMBERED FOREVER.

20:59.510 --> 21:01.580
BUT YOU IGNORED ME

21:01.610 --> 21:03.780
AND MY MUSIC!

21:03.810 --> 21:08.020
BUT RUPES, WE ALREADY
HAD A NATIONAL ANTHEM--

21:08.050 --> 21:10.090
THAT HAD WORDS.

21:10.120 --> 21:11.920
BUT MINE WAS BETTER!

21:11.950 --> 21:13.360
* YEOW!

21:13.390 --> 21:15.090
NO!

21:15.120 --> 21:18.990
ANYWAY,
NOW I HAVE THE POWER--

21:19.030 --> 21:20.660
YOUR POWER.

21:20.700 --> 21:22.900
AND THINGS
ARE GONNA BE DIFFERENT.

21:22.930 --> 21:26.840
PEOPLE ARE GONNA
KNOW WHO I AM.

21:26.870 --> 21:29.040
WITH THE HELP

21:29.070 --> 21:31.510
OF MY GALACTIC FUNK BAND!

21:31.540 --> 21:35.410
BABY!

21:35.440 --> 21:37.010
YOU HAVE TO DIG.

21:37.050 --> 21:39.780
IT'S ALL ABOUT
THE KEY MAN'S BIG PLAN

21:39.820 --> 21:42.750
TO MAKE THE UNIVERSE
SIT UP AND NOTICE HIM.

21:42.790 --> 21:47.760
JUST LIKE
THEY NOTICE ME, BOBBLES.

21:47.790 --> 21:49.730
AFTER PERFORMING
A SONIC SCAN

21:49.760 --> 21:54.400
OF EACH OF THE BAND MEMBERS
USING MY BIO-QUANTUM FILTER,

21:54.430 --> 21:58.370
THEY'RE ALL MANNEQUINS,
EXCEPT FOR ONE.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.700
YOU MEAN LIKE PUPPETS?

22:00.740 --> 22:04.470
YEAH. BUT WHO'S
PULLING THE STRINGS?

22:04.510 --> 22:07.110
THAT WOULD BE
THE KEYBOARD MAN.

22:07.140 --> 22:09.450
NOW I UNDERSTAND
WHY HE WANTED

22:09.480 --> 22:11.550
THE 64-STRING GUITAR.

22:11.580 --> 22:14.080
ARE YOU FAMILIAR
WITH THE STRING THEORY?

22:14.120 --> 22:16.920
OF COURSE. IT'S THAT
STUFF THAT YOU WRAP

22:16.950 --> 22:20.090
AROUND YOUR PINKIE
SO THAT YOU DON'T, UH...

22:20.120 --> 22:21.590
YOU DON'T, UH...

22:21.620 --> 22:22.830
AH, I FORGOT.

22:25.160 --> 22:28.630
THINK OF THE UNIVERSE
AS A GALACTIC ORCHESTRA,

22:28.660 --> 22:31.800
THE KEYBOARD MAN KNOWS
THAT IF HE CAN CHANNEL

22:31.830 --> 22:34.140
ZODAVIA'S ENERGY
INTO HIS GUITAR,

22:34.170 --> 22:38.970
HE CAN USE THAT POWER
TO CONTROL THE UNIVERSE.

22:39.010 --> 22:43.510
UH, YOU SAID
SOMETHING ABOUT STRING?

22:43.550 --> 22:46.680
SO IF "FINGERS"
WAS TOUGH BEFORE,

22:46.720 --> 22:49.180
HE'LL BE IMPOSSIBLE
TO STOP NOW.

22:49.220 --> 22:51.790
THEN, WHAT'S
HIS NEXT MOVE?

22:51.820 --> 22:54.160
BEATS ME.
I'M A BRILLIANT SCIENTIST,

22:54.190 --> 22:55.920
NOT A MOODY MUSICIAN.

22:55.960 --> 23:00.600
A MOODY MUSICIAN
LOOKING FOR ATTENTION.

23:00.630 --> 23:02.430
WHATEVER HE'S GONNA TRY,

23:02.470 --> 23:05.730
HE'LL WANT THE BIGGEST
AUDIENCE POSSIBLE.

23:05.770 --> 23:08.470
All: GALAXYFEST!

23:08.500 --> 23:11.010
THE ULTIMATE
CONCERT OF CONCERTS.

23:11.040 --> 23:13.580
WE GOTTA FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO STOP HIM

23:13.610 --> 23:15.710
AND GET ZODAVIA BACK!

23:15.740 --> 23:17.080
LET'S JET!

23:21.480 --> 23:23.150
Ace: HEY, KEEP
YOUR EYES PEELED.

23:23.190 --> 23:26.790
THE KEY MAN'S GOTTA
BE AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.

23:26.820 --> 23:29.790
YOO-HOO! HEY, LOONIES!

23:29.830 --> 23:33.500
GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT
TO THE GAME, BOBBLES.

23:33.530 --> 23:35.460
ME AND THE BAND
WANNA WELCOME YOU

23:35.500 --> 23:37.070
WITH A LITTLE SONG
I CALL,

23:37.100 --> 23:39.770
KISS YOUR BUTTS
BYE-BYE, LOONATICS!

23:42.040 --> 23:44.040
GO AHEAD, WORM BRAIN!

23:44.070 --> 23:46.040
HIT ME!

23:46.070 --> 23:48.080
All: AAH!

23:48.110 --> 23:49.140
All: UHH!

23:52.180 --> 23:54.020
YOW!

24:12.070 --> 24:13.600
SEE IF YOU CAN KEEP UP

24:13.640 --> 24:16.840
WITH THIS
LITTLE NUMBER, BOOTES.

24:16.870 --> 24:19.640
HA HA HA, HOO HOO!

24:19.680 --> 24:21.510
AAH!

24:21.540 --> 24:24.010
OH, YEAH.

24:24.050 --> 24:26.750
IT'S TIME
TO TAKE TOTAL CONTROL.

24:26.780 --> 24:29.590
ONE UNIVERSE
UNDER ONE GROOVE.

24:29.620 --> 24:32.720
MY GROOVE!

24:32.760 --> 24:34.560
NOT IF I CAN HELP IT.

24:34.590 --> 24:36.090
Rupes: BLAST HER, BOOTES!

24:45.700 --> 24:48.140
Rupes: ONCE I BOOGIE MY WAY

24:48.170 --> 24:50.740
THROUGH THIS WORMHOLE
AND FIND THE OTHER DOG

24:50.770 --> 24:52.810
OF EQUAL POWER,

24:52.840 --> 24:54.180
THE WHOLE UNIVERSE
WILL BE PLAYING

24:54.210 --> 24:56.750
MY TUNE, BABY!

24:56.780 --> 24:58.710
Zodavia: STOP HIM!

25:03.120 --> 25:05.220
HE'S GONE.

25:05.250 --> 25:08.990
GOOD RIDDANCE TO BAD
MUSIC, I ALWAYS SAY.

25:09.020 --> 25:10.630
YOU KNOW,
DUCK HAS A POINT.

25:10.660 --> 25:13.030
WE CAN ALWAYS
GET THE GUITAR BACK.

25:13.060 --> 25:14.530
I'M AFRAID THAT
IT'S NOT JUST THE GUITAR
