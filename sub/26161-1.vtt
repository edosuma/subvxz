00:39.122 --> 00:41.708
Are you okay?

00:47.589 --> 00:49.966
Here you go.

00:51.050 --> 00:53.052
Okay, much better.

00:55.013 --> 00:56.514
Walk on this side.

00:57.015 --> 00:58.058
No.

00:58.641 --> 01:01.811
I'll walk on this side
so I can protect you.

01:02.395 --> 01:04.939
You're my hero.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.443
Mom.

01:09.444 --> 01:11.321
Can I hold your hand?

01:12.822 --> 01:14.282
Of course!

01:15.742 --> 01:16.868
Yeah!

01:28.254 --> 01:31.216
Doesn't she have an umbrella?

01:38.389 --> 01:39.641
I'll lend her mine.

01:41.768 --> 01:42.811
Ichigo!

01:51.986 --> 01:54.989
It's cold.

01:55.907 --> 01:56.950
Ichigo!

01:57.033 --> 01:59.327
Mom, I'm cold.

02:00.537 --> 02:01.788
Ichigo!

02:11.840 --> 02:13.007
Ichigo...

03:26.789 --> 03:28.041
MYSTERIOUS SINKHOLE

04:02.075 --> 04:03.326
You punk!

04:08.081 --> 04:10.708
What's your problem?

04:12.961 --> 04:14.170
You three.

04:16.965 --> 04:18.258
Look over there.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.098
What?

04:28.476 --> 04:31.020
Question. What's that you see?

04:33.690 --> 04:35.275
Answer me!

04:35.358 --> 04:38.361
Flowers for a kid who got run over.

04:38.444 --> 04:39.529
Correct!

04:43.199 --> 04:46.577
Question. Who knocked them over like that?

04:47.328 --> 04:48.579
Us... on our skateboards.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.001
Correct.

05:00.174 --> 05:02.010
You owe him an apology.

05:13.646 --> 05:14.939
Him?

05:15.023 --> 05:16.274
Who?

05:16.357 --> 05:17.567
Just apologize!

05:20.528 --> 05:22.822
Forgive us!

05:22.905 --> 05:24.741
Not me, him!

05:24.824 --> 05:25.908
What?

05:26.617 --> 05:29.037
We apologize!

05:31.372 --> 05:34.000
We're really sorry!

05:42.425 --> 05:45.178
I scared off those losers for good.

05:46.262 --> 05:47.096
Thank you.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.641
Don't hang around. Go to heaven.

05:51.225 --> 05:52.393
Okay.

05:57.815 --> 06:00.193
You go to hell!

06:08.493 --> 06:09.368
Chad.

06:10.244 --> 06:13.206
Ichigo, you better watch your back.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.252
Thank you.

06:27.261 --> 06:29.055
-I'm home.
-Hi, Ichigo.

06:30.598 --> 06:31.724
You're late. Dad!

06:33.017 --> 06:35.478
Why are you so late?

06:35.561 --> 06:36.938
It's still 7:00!

06:37.021 --> 06:38.439
Don't talk back.

06:39.941 --> 06:43.820
We eat dinner as a family, don't forget!

06:43.903 --> 06:46.989
I guided a lost soul to heaven.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.784
I didn't ask you to do that!

06:49.867 --> 06:51.994
I can't help how I was born.

06:52.662 --> 06:54.330
Lay off, you two.

06:54.413 --> 06:56.916
Eat before it gets cold.

06:56.999 --> 06:58.084
Forget them, Yuzu.

06:58.167 --> 07:00.837
I've had it! Good night!

07:00.920 --> 07:03.464
-How about dinner?
-Wait!

07:03.548 --> 07:05.216
I won't eat your food. That punk...

07:07.552 --> 07:08.719
Ichigo!

07:08.803 --> 07:12.890
He's stressed.
He's been seeing more ghosts lately.

07:15.101 --> 07:18.479
You mean, he tells you those things?

07:19.230 --> 07:20.189
Yes.

07:22.066 --> 07:24.569
He doesn't tell me his problems.

07:25.903 --> 07:28.364
I wouldn't either, Dad.

07:30.074 --> 07:31.284
Wait, Yuzu.

07:32.618 --> 07:36.122
You communicate like a 14-year-old.

07:36.205 --> 07:39.083
I wouldn't confide in you.

07:39.167 --> 07:40.793
Come on, Karin.

07:41.711 --> 07:42.712
Karin?

07:47.758 --> 07:49.969
The kids are disrespectful lately.

07:50.970 --> 07:54.515
Masaki, where did I go wrong?

08:20.208 --> 08:21.209
It's close.

08:27.465 --> 08:28.716
What is? You...

08:33.137 --> 08:34.805
You can see me?

08:34.889 --> 08:38.226
What century did you die in? Just go.

08:50.488 --> 08:54.283
No. I don't want to go to hell.

08:54.867 --> 08:58.788
Have no fear.
You're going to Soul Society.

08:59.664 --> 09:01.666
It's a peaceful place.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.888
What the hell was that?

09:15.972 --> 09:17.139
Where did he go?

09:22.770 --> 09:23.604
Grand Fisher?

09:24.814 --> 09:26.691
No. It's Fishbone.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.777
It's huge.

09:30.778 --> 09:32.071
What's huge?

09:32.655 --> 09:35.241
You feel at home, don't you, ghost?

09:35.324 --> 09:36.200
Binding spell!

09:40.413 --> 09:42.164
What's this, ghost?

09:42.248 --> 09:44.667
I'm a soul reaper, not a ghost.

09:46.711 --> 09:47.587
A reaper?

09:47.670 --> 09:48.879
Dad!

09:50.172 --> 09:51.007
Yuzu...

09:51.090 --> 09:53.759
-It's here.
-What's here?

10:03.269 --> 10:06.022
A human... broke my spell.

10:09.317 --> 10:10.943
-Yuzu.
-You okay?

10:11.027 --> 10:14.113
Why did you scream, Yuzu?

10:18.534 --> 10:21.537
I heard a scary voice.

10:22.538 --> 10:24.165
What voice?

10:27.168 --> 10:28.294
Where from?

10:40.264 --> 10:41.557
Hey...

10:45.269 --> 10:46.437
What the hell was that?

10:48.189 --> 10:49.899
He saw the Hollow.

11:01.619 --> 11:03.079
What is this thing?

11:04.038 --> 11:06.123
Yuzu! Let her go!

11:15.091 --> 11:18.135
I want your soul.

11:18.844 --> 11:19.887
Don't move!

11:33.150 --> 11:37.446
You must have high spiritual pressure
to see a Hollow.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.447
Huh?

11:38.531 --> 11:40.699
Hollows eat souls like yours.

11:40.783 --> 11:41.867
That's what it wants.

11:44.954 --> 11:48.416
I want your soul.

11:48.499 --> 11:49.500
Mine?

11:56.382 --> 12:00.886
Give me your soul.

12:05.766 --> 12:06.934
What's going on?

12:08.185 --> 12:09.103
What is it?

12:09.186 --> 12:11.272
-A Hollow.
-Which is?

12:12.690 --> 12:13.566
Look out!

12:18.571 --> 12:20.448
I stepped in too far.

12:21.282 --> 12:23.075
Get your hands off him!

12:51.061 --> 12:52.229
Are you okay?

12:53.147 --> 12:54.815
It got my good arm.

12:55.900 --> 12:58.986
But if I don't fight,
it'll devour our souls.

12:59.904 --> 13:01.322
Isn't there a way?

13:02.865 --> 13:04.116
Yes, there is.

13:04.909 --> 13:06.076
Which is?

13:09.246 --> 13:10.581
You become a reaper.

13:12.291 --> 13:13.167
Pardon?

13:14.001 --> 13:16.504
Only reapers can destroy Hollows.

13:17.338 --> 13:21.509
So you have to become one.
That's our only chance.

13:21.592 --> 13:22.801
How?

13:25.137 --> 13:28.390
I'll stab you in the center of your chest,

13:28.974 --> 13:32.394
and inject my energy through my Zanpakuto.

13:32.478 --> 13:33.854
If we fail, we'll...

13:36.148 --> 13:37.441
both die.

13:37.525 --> 13:39.235
-No way!
-We must risk it!

13:39.318 --> 13:41.946
The Hollow will do anything to get you.

13:46.158 --> 13:50.037
Give me your soul.

13:50.829 --> 13:52.373
Ichigo...

13:53.541 --> 13:55.084
I'm scared.

13:56.335 --> 13:57.836
Ichigo...

14:04.635 --> 14:05.928
Decide!

14:16.355 --> 14:17.314
Do it!

15:04.278 --> 15:07.197
<i>His strong spiritual pressure...</i>

15:08.782 --> 15:10.576
<i>is making the sword huge!</i>

15:42.149 --> 15:43.651
Are you really... just a human?

15:49.156 --> 15:50.282
What else?

15:52.409 --> 15:53.911
I'm just a human.

16:05.756 --> 16:06.840
Was it a dream?

16:15.516 --> 16:17.142
That was intense.

16:37.621 --> 16:39.331
Is this from...

16:40.332 --> 16:41.208
last night?

16:42.167 --> 16:43.502
It was a truck.

16:44.420 --> 16:47.798
A hit-and-run. The driver lost control.

16:49.383 --> 16:51.051
<i>What's going on?</i>

16:51.135 --> 16:52.219
What?

16:53.012 --> 16:54.263
What happened?

16:55.514 --> 16:57.224
Yuzu, are you okay?

16:57.933 --> 16:59.101
Huh?

17:00.144 --> 17:02.813
You don't remember last night?

17:03.981 --> 17:05.482
What do you mean?

17:08.902 --> 17:11.572
Dad, what happened here?

17:21.749 --> 17:22.833
Quit it!

17:25.502 --> 17:27.671
Thinking about Ichigo again?

17:27.755 --> 17:29.298
No, I'm not!

17:30.257 --> 17:33.177
What's good about him, Orihime?

17:33.886 --> 17:38.223
He's grumpy, childish,
and his hair's orange.

17:38.307 --> 17:39.683
He's funny.

17:40.309 --> 17:41.602
Is he?

17:41.685 --> 17:44.021
You just don't get it, Tatsuki.

17:44.813 --> 17:48.317
When I think about his grumpy face...

17:53.280 --> 17:54.865
He's adorable!

17:54.948 --> 17:56.366
It's beyond me.

17:57.117 --> 18:01.747
A truck crashed into Ichigo's house
last night.

18:01.830 --> 18:02.956
A truck?

18:03.040 --> 18:04.583
Is he okay?

18:06.001 --> 18:08.587
He's dead. He died on the spot.

18:09.630 --> 18:10.839
I'm alive.

18:12.132 --> 18:13.675
You are, too!

18:13.759 --> 18:16.178
Ichigo, are you okay?

18:16.261 --> 18:17.346
Sure I am.

18:17.429 --> 18:20.390
Nothing can kill his kind.

18:21.308 --> 18:22.935
How about you, Chad?

18:23.435 --> 18:25.854
-Thank God!
-Calm down.

18:25.938 --> 18:29.149
How did a truck crash into your house?

18:29.233 --> 18:31.860
-It wasn't a truck.
-What then?

18:31.944 --> 18:33.028
A crane?

18:33.112 --> 18:36.448
A creature put its huge hand
through the wall.

18:39.910 --> 18:42.037
You hit your head, Ichigo?

18:42.621 --> 18:44.123
Sounds like it.

18:44.206 --> 18:46.166
-I'm fine.
-Good morning!

18:52.131 --> 18:54.883
Rukia Kuchiki is our new classmate.

18:55.551 --> 18:56.885
Meet Ichigo.

19:00.514 --> 19:02.349
-You know her?
-No.

19:02.432 --> 19:03.350
Ichigo.

19:06.019 --> 19:07.563
Is this textbook okay?

19:09.773 --> 19:12.109
MAKE A SCENE AND YOU'RE DEAD!

19:16.071 --> 19:17.531
<i>You can't return?</i>

19:17.614 --> 19:21.118
Only reapers can travel to Soul Society.

19:21.743 --> 19:25.956
I can't go back
because I lost my reaper powers.

19:26.582 --> 19:29.501
Where did your powers go?

19:34.298 --> 19:37.426
I gave you more than I intended to.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.804
Because of your high spiritual pressure.

19:41.722 --> 19:43.473
I'm not a reaper, am I?

19:44.516 --> 19:48.270
Your soul has turned into a reaper's soul.

19:50.147 --> 19:53.567
So now you're not a reaper,
people can see you?

19:55.694 --> 19:59.531
No, I disguised as a human
with a faux body.

19:59.615 --> 20:02.242
Reapers, spirits, Hollows are invisible.

20:02.868 --> 20:06.163
Anyway, I need my powers back.

20:07.998 --> 20:09.499
Wait!

20:12.920 --> 20:15.088
Hey, that's me!

20:16.548 --> 20:20.052
That's me! What's happening to me?

20:23.513 --> 20:27.184
Stab me with this and reverse the powers.

20:27.267 --> 20:28.602
-Wait!
-Two hands!

20:29.478 --> 20:31.897
-Ready?
-No, please don't!

20:42.866 --> 20:43.951
What?

20:44.743 --> 20:45.827
It's not working.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.122
Huh?

20:49.706 --> 20:51.625
Your energy's too low.

20:58.632 --> 21:00.759
What do we do now?

21:01.260 --> 21:02.261
Hey.

21:06.139 --> 21:07.474
I know.

21:07.975 --> 21:12.229
You can work with me
as a substitute reaper.

21:12.312 --> 21:13.730
Work?

21:14.731 --> 21:15.732
<i>Get this.</i>

21:16.984 --> 21:18.902
<i>There are two kinds of souls.</i>

21:21.113 --> 21:23.615
<i>One is Whole, the normal ones.</i>

21:24.157 --> 21:27.619
<i>The ghosts you see are this type.</i>

21:28.745 --> 21:32.040
<i>The others are Hollows that eat souls.</i>

21:32.582 --> 21:37.170
<i>They're the souls of those</i>
<i>who died with a grudge.</i>

21:39.631 --> 21:42.092
<i>Reapers have two duties.</i>

21:42.718 --> 21:47.431
<i>We guide the Wholes to Soul Society</i>
<i>with a ritual.</i>

21:48.557 --> 21:50.350
<i>It's called a Soul Burial.</i>

21:52.436 --> 21:55.105
<i>I did this to the man in your bedroom.</i>

21:57.858 --> 22:02.404
<i>Our other duty is to destroy Hollows</i>
<i>with Zanpakuto.</i>

22:03.864 --> 22:06.158
<i>You'll help me do the latter.</i>

22:08.243 --> 22:09.244
No, I won't!

22:09.328 --> 22:13.373
The Hollows might harm innocent people!

22:13.457 --> 22:18.378
So what? I only fought last night
to protect my family.

22:18.879 --> 22:21.298
I'll return your powers.

22:21.381 --> 22:24.885
-Your energy's too low.
-You said it was high yesterday!

22:24.968 --> 22:28.263
It might work, but it will kill you.

22:29.222 --> 22:32.642
<i>Your soul has high pressure,</i>
<i>but it's untrained.</i>

22:33.268 --> 22:39.357
<i>Your body is too weak to survive it.</i>

22:39.441 --> 22:41.026
What should I do?

22:41.109 --> 22:44.571
Destroy the Hollows
to increase your energy.

22:45.155 --> 22:48.658
<i>But to endure the energy,</i>
<i>you'll need training.</i>

22:48.742 --> 22:49.993
Training?

22:50.744 --> 22:53.663
Just give in to your fate.

22:53.747 --> 22:54.873
Forget it!

22:55.791 --> 22:57.501
Screw fate! I want to be myself!

23:02.297 --> 23:03.548
I'm home.

23:05.008 --> 23:06.218
Hi.

23:06.301 --> 23:08.428
Have you seen my pajamas?

23:08.512 --> 23:09.805
Why would I?

23:12.015 --> 23:14.184
I can't find them.

23:22.275 --> 23:23.944
Don't barge into my room!

23:24.027 --> 23:25.487
It's my room.

23:25.987 --> 23:27.114
Yuzu's pajamas!

23:27.197 --> 23:29.533
I have no house or clothes,

23:29.616 --> 23:32.160
and you need my help to become a reaper.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.995
Forget it.

23:34.079 --> 23:36.248
Give in to your fate.

23:37.541 --> 23:38.375
Ichigo!

23:38.458 --> 23:39.960
Who's there?

23:40.919 --> 23:42.129
Yes?

23:44.256 --> 23:45.674
-What's up?
-Nothing.

23:50.554 --> 23:51.847
Hello!

23:56.601 --> 23:59.771
Don't try sneaking girls in here!

23:59.855 --> 24:01.189
I am not.

24:05.277 --> 24:06.778
Hey, reaper.

24:07.404 --> 24:08.613
Rukia Kuchiki.

24:10.240 --> 24:11.408
That's my name.

24:12.159 --> 24:15.078
Get out of my sight right now.

24:15.162 --> 24:18.915
You can't escape your fate
to be a reaper's agent.

24:18.999 --> 24:23.003
Comply with the rules of communal life.

24:23.086 --> 24:25.463
What do you mean, communal...

24:34.181 --> 24:35.640
Dad!

24:36.850 --> 24:37.893
Let's go.

24:41.062 --> 24:42.022
Huh?

24:43.565 --> 24:44.774
Watch it!

24:45.901 --> 24:46.818
Hey!

24:49.279 --> 24:50.363
What's this?

24:51.948 --> 24:53.366
Reaper training.

24:54.492 --> 24:56.453
This isn't training!

24:58.371 --> 24:59.289
Stop it!

25:02.500 --> 25:04.169
That does it!

25:05.879 --> 25:07.505
Hey!

25:07.589 --> 25:08.924
Don't walk away.

25:10.842 --> 25:12.093
Ichigo!

25:12.177 --> 25:14.888
-Hi.
-You're dating the new girl?

25:14.971 --> 25:16.514
Of course not!

25:16.598 --> 25:17.515
Fast move.

25:19.351 --> 25:21.353
You waste no time.

25:23.939 --> 25:26.733
He's just showing the new girl around.

25:26.816 --> 25:29.236
What have you shown her?

25:29.319 --> 25:30.403
How rude!

25:32.822 --> 25:33.990
Hello.

25:34.074 --> 25:36.201
We're just classmates.

25:37.285 --> 25:40.247
-Can I speak to you?
-Yes, Miss Kuchiki?

25:43.291 --> 25:46.586
Is it a stomachache?
Let's go to the nurse.

25:49.256 --> 25:50.423
She hit him.

25:50.507 --> 25:52.217
Did you see that?

25:56.680 --> 25:58.139
No! Ouch!

26:08.817 --> 26:10.860
I have better things to do!

26:11.987 --> 26:13.029
I'm going.

26:22.998 --> 26:24.749
Why you...

26:27.335 --> 26:29.879
You're not a reaper now, so...

26:48.982 --> 26:50.692
Damn it.

27:15.508 --> 27:18.470
You have no friends...
I can be your friend.

27:22.557 --> 27:25.977
A reaper and a human can't be friends.

27:26.728 --> 27:28.188
I'm kidding.

27:28.271 --> 27:30.148
Don't be so serious.

27:32.817 --> 27:36.654
I don't need friends.
I live by the reaper codes.

27:36.738 --> 27:38.823
Reaper codes?

27:41.451 --> 27:43.119
Hi, Ichigo.

27:44.913 --> 27:46.039
Orihime.

27:46.539 --> 27:47.874
What's going on?

27:49.000 --> 27:50.877
Well, we...

27:52.962 --> 27:54.005
Rukia?

27:54.089 --> 27:56.674
Greetings, Orihime.

27:56.758 --> 27:57.675
That's old!

27:57.759 --> 28:00.261
-It's in your book.
-My manga?

28:00.345 --> 28:02.764
-It's modern Japanese.
-It's not.

28:02.847 --> 28:04.974
Sorry to interrupt.

28:05.683 --> 28:07.811
-See you.
-But...

28:12.065 --> 28:15.777
She completely misunderstands
our relationship.

28:16.820 --> 28:17.654
Resume.

28:17.737 --> 28:19.114
I'm done.

28:19.197 --> 28:21.783
Reapers obey their superiors.

28:22.325 --> 28:24.327
Since when am I inferior to you?

28:25.036 --> 28:27.747
I need you to help me go back.

28:27.831 --> 28:30.083
You can make it in this world.

28:30.917 --> 28:33.586
You can be a swordsmanship coach.

28:34.212 --> 28:35.213
See you.

28:56.276 --> 28:59.779
URAHARA SHOP

29:12.417 --> 29:14.085
How's your faux body?

29:14.961 --> 29:18.256
You look all right
as a human high school girl.

29:18.882 --> 29:20.425
Don't be ridiculous.

29:21.259 --> 29:23.553
I have no other choice.

29:26.347 --> 29:29.768
I have a new battery for you.

29:30.477 --> 29:31.728
Here.

29:58.421 --> 29:59.923
You have a plan?

30:03.259 --> 30:07.222
Reapers who give their powers to a human
can be executed.

30:09.641 --> 30:13.311
You had no choice,
but you defied the reaper's code.

30:14.229 --> 30:16.731
They might find out.

30:22.779 --> 30:25.448
I can't locate her spiritual pressure.

30:26.032 --> 30:30.328
Rukia wouldn't lose
to a lesser Hollow like Fishbone.

30:31.871 --> 30:32.956
Did she really...

30:34.165 --> 30:36.292
give her powers to a human?

30:36.376 --> 30:37.585
Find her.

30:38.628 --> 30:40.672
If she gave him her powers...

30:41.714 --> 30:43.132
detain her.

30:44.968 --> 30:46.886
That's an order from above.

31:16.124 --> 31:17.458
Who are you?

31:18.376 --> 31:19.919
So...

31:23.131 --> 31:24.632
you can see me.

31:26.676 --> 31:28.303
What do you want?

31:29.095 --> 31:33.474
I sensed high spiritual pressure
and found you.

31:38.313 --> 31:39.480
Rukia.

31:40.565 --> 31:41.858
You know her?

31:42.984 --> 31:45.820
The reaper woman who visited you.

31:45.904 --> 31:46.988
A reaper?

31:47.655 --> 31:49.157
As if I do.

31:49.240 --> 31:50.825
Don't play dumb!

31:52.577 --> 31:55.830
She was after a Hollow known
as Grand Fisher.

31:55.914 --> 31:59.083
And she was attracted to your powers.

31:59.167 --> 32:00.752
Grand Fisher?

32:00.835 --> 32:02.086
Hey.

32:03.421 --> 32:04.881
Where's Rukia?

32:06.507 --> 32:08.843
I don't know any reapers.

32:09.886 --> 32:11.930
Don't lie to me.

32:38.414 --> 32:39.916
The arrow...

32:55.390 --> 32:56.349
It means...

32:57.767 --> 32:59.060
it's a Quincy.

33:22.750 --> 33:23.960
<i>Rukia.</i>

33:25.336 --> 33:26.963
Tell me why you are here.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.383
What do you mean?

33:31.467 --> 33:36.931
You see, I hate being the last one
to know what's going on.

33:38.933 --> 33:40.143
Like what?

33:40.226 --> 33:41.519
You're lying.

33:42.937 --> 33:44.689
Don't hide things from me.

33:46.190 --> 33:48.026
I'm hiding nothing.

33:48.109 --> 33:51.571
Then why did the red-haired reaper
try to kill me?

33:55.783 --> 33:56.993
I knew it.

33:59.203 --> 34:00.288
Spill it out.

34:06.961 --> 34:08.337
Then I'll tell you.

34:08.838 --> 34:11.382
You came here chasing a Grand Hollow.

34:11.466 --> 34:14.093
Now the red-haired reaper wants you.

34:14.177 --> 34:16.763
And I almost got killed for hiding you.

34:16.846 --> 34:18.598
Shut up and start training.

34:18.681 --> 34:20.224
Is that a joke?

34:20.308 --> 34:22.435
Don't get me involved!

34:22.518 --> 34:24.103
You need to train!

34:24.187 --> 34:25.730
What for?

34:25.813 --> 34:29.108
I don't care if you're stuck here!

34:29.192 --> 34:31.819
Who said you could live here...

34:34.155 --> 34:35.490
<i>Train or...</i>

34:36.866 --> 34:38.242
<i>you'll die.</i>

34:44.707 --> 34:46.375
Are you certain?

34:47.919 --> 34:53.633
When a Hollow turns up,
Rukia will emerge with that human.

35:23.246 --> 35:25.706
Where do you think she lives?

35:26.874 --> 35:30.419
-Maybe with Ichigo.
-Really?

35:30.503 --> 35:33.506
Relax. It's just a rumor.

35:36.384 --> 35:38.219
FIGHT YOURSELF!

35:39.137 --> 35:40.388
Dad...

35:50.314 --> 35:51.149
You're...

35:51.941 --> 35:53.025
a reaper.

35:56.779 --> 35:58.239
I thought so.

35:59.323 --> 36:01.117
Are you an idiot?

36:01.200 --> 36:03.578
Your spiritual pressure is high.

36:04.537 --> 36:10.126
But it got higher in the last few days
since the new girl came.

36:10.918 --> 36:12.461
That girl...

36:12.545 --> 36:16.007
she looks human, so that's a faux body.

36:19.051 --> 36:20.469
Who are you?

36:21.053 --> 36:23.764
You've never noticed me, have you?

36:24.432 --> 36:28.853
You transferred here a year ago,
but we've never talked.

36:30.354 --> 36:32.023
Who the hell are you?

36:33.524 --> 36:35.568
My name is Uryu Ishida.

36:37.403 --> 36:41.199
How do you know
I have high spiritual pressure?

36:41.908 --> 36:45.953
I'm from the Quincy tribe
and reapers killed my people.

36:47.705 --> 36:50.166
Is anyone sane around here?

36:50.249 --> 36:51.292
Watch this.

37:17.151 --> 37:18.527
The arrows yesterday...

37:20.780 --> 37:21.906
That was you.

37:22.573 --> 37:24.617
Are you convinced?

37:25.284 --> 37:28.079
I'm a human, but I can destroy Hollows.

37:28.663 --> 37:34.043
I live to exorcize Hollows
and avenge my tribe.

37:35.586 --> 37:39.840
A year ago, I sensed your power,
so I came here.

37:45.930 --> 37:47.306
Wait!

37:47.390 --> 37:48.599
I challenge you.

37:49.308 --> 37:50.351
What?

37:50.935 --> 37:53.980
We share the world with other beings.

37:55.356 --> 37:56.732
Humans...

37:57.441 --> 37:58.776
lost souls...

37:59.360 --> 38:02.280
and souls that became Hollows and reapers.

38:02.363 --> 38:05.032
Plus, those who hate reapers.

38:05.116 --> 38:08.786
There's a turbulent world
that people can't see.

38:09.662 --> 38:13.874
If you're a reaper,
it's my fate to defeat you.

38:14.458 --> 38:16.585
Wait! This is too complicated!

38:16.669 --> 38:21.924
I'll prove that the Quincies are
superior to the reapers.

38:23.718 --> 38:24.885
Hey, don't!

38:24.969 --> 38:26.012
Use your sword.

38:26.095 --> 38:27.013
No!

38:30.016 --> 38:31.309
Well, then...

38:32.268 --> 38:34.770
I'll have to force you to be a reaper.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.582
What did you do?

38:56.625 --> 38:57.835
Ichigo!

38:57.918 --> 38:59.462
Hollows are on the move!

39:01.547 --> 39:02.381
Get to work!

39:03.090 --> 39:05.426
What? Wait a minute!

39:10.348 --> 39:12.224
-What?
-Hollows!

39:12.308 --> 39:13.851
So, what?

39:13.934 --> 39:18.689
Exorcize them so your powers increase.
Then, I can go back!

39:18.773 --> 39:22.443
No way.
Who cares about reapers and Hollows?

39:22.526 --> 39:25.571
Someone help me, please!

39:25.654 --> 39:26.697
That voice...

39:27.865 --> 39:28.699
Hey!

39:35.331 --> 39:39.377
All these Hollows!
Is someone baiting them?

39:41.629 --> 39:44.590
They might attack people
or spirits any time.

39:53.974 --> 39:55.726
I'm scared.

39:55.810 --> 39:58.562
He hasn't gone to heaven yet.

40:07.363 --> 40:08.697
Wait!

40:08.781 --> 40:12.827
You must protect all people and spirits,
not just him.

40:13.327 --> 40:14.286
Huh?

40:14.370 --> 40:17.581
Reapers treat all spirits
and people equally.

40:18.082 --> 40:21.127
Take an oath if you want to save him.

40:24.672 --> 40:26.966
Screw the reaper oath!

40:37.643 --> 40:38.894
Go now.

40:42.314 --> 40:45.693
I'm not so noble
to risk my life for strangers...

40:47.278 --> 40:51.198
or so low to desert people in trouble!

41:03.377 --> 41:04.503
I'm here! Watch it!

41:46.086 --> 41:47.213
Renji!

42:08.192 --> 42:09.818
You're slow.

42:31.423 --> 42:33.133
Don't mess with reapers.

42:43.561 --> 42:45.104
That was easy.

42:52.486 --> 42:53.862
Don't, Renji.

42:59.577 --> 43:01.662
You didn't dodge that.

43:02.496 --> 43:04.164
I went easy on you.

43:06.041 --> 43:07.167
Why are you here?

43:07.251 --> 43:08.836
You know why.

43:09.420 --> 43:13.465
To take you in
and kill the human with your powers.

43:16.885 --> 43:19.972
What's that look on your face?

43:21.473 --> 43:24.143
It's offensive that you look so human!

43:26.687 --> 43:31.567
We were both born in Rukon District
and adopted by the noble Kuchiki Clan.

43:32.192 --> 43:36.447
You were groomed to become
an elite soul reaper!

43:38.657 --> 43:41.285
You shouldn't look like a human.

43:43.912 --> 43:46.624
Right, Captain Kuchiki?

43:51.420 --> 43:52.630
Brother...

44:11.523 --> 44:13.525
Why did you break the code?

44:15.778 --> 44:19.907
I gave him my powers
so I wouldn't be eaten.

44:20.866 --> 44:23.410
I gave him all my powers by mistake.

44:23.494 --> 44:25.496
That's an excuse.

44:29.750 --> 44:32.544
What you did is a felony.

44:34.213 --> 44:38.050
You'd be executed
if you went back to Soul Society.

44:40.594 --> 44:44.181
You have to get your powers back from him.

44:45.933 --> 44:47.476
Then you will be pardoned.

44:47.559 --> 44:52.523
He'd die if I did that now.
His pressure is too low.

44:53.565 --> 44:54.733
So?

44:56.485 --> 44:57.736
Let him die.

45:01.198 --> 45:04.034
It was I who gave him my powers.

45:05.619 --> 45:07.079
It wasn't his fault.

45:11.375 --> 45:14.795
A reaper's job isn't to kill innocent men.

45:19.425 --> 45:21.969
Why do you feel compassion for him?

45:22.052 --> 45:23.679
I don't.

45:23.762 --> 45:25.681
Retrieve your powers from him...

45:27.015 --> 45:28.142
and kill him.

45:29.768 --> 45:31.186
Or else, Rukia...

45:32.813 --> 45:34.314
you'll die.

45:41.780 --> 45:43.365
You have until the full moon.

45:44.908 --> 45:46.160
Wait.

45:46.660 --> 45:47.744
Brother!

45:48.787 --> 45:51.331
Get the Hollow to the west, Renji.

46:09.600 --> 46:15.689
Your wounds must heal
before you return to your human self.

46:16.273 --> 46:19.443
Or you might die, both body and soul.

46:25.157 --> 46:26.700
What will we do?

46:28.535 --> 46:29.912
Rukia...

46:47.346 --> 46:49.640
Okay, much better.

46:50.807 --> 46:52.309
Walk on this side. No.

46:53.977 --> 46:57.814
I'll walk on this side
so I can protect you.

46:57.898 --> 47:01.068
You're my hero.

47:03.111 --> 47:05.447
Is it okay if I hold your hand?

47:06.031 --> 47:07.616
Of course!

47:12.329 --> 47:13.372
Ichigo!

47:28.929 --> 47:31.306
Mom?

47:55.956 --> 47:57.040
Dad...

47:58.000 --> 48:00.335
Hey, you're awake.

48:02.921 --> 48:05.465
That was some accident you had.

48:06.842 --> 48:08.552
A classmate brought you here.

48:09.761 --> 48:12.055
Bring her home some time!

48:19.688 --> 48:21.565
I dreamed about Mom.

48:23.275 --> 48:26.403
The anniversary of her death is soon.

48:28.405 --> 48:30.574
I dream about her sometimes.

48:37.623 --> 48:39.249
Me too. Every night.

48:46.214 --> 48:48.967
I failed to protect her.

48:52.012 --> 48:53.680
Mom died...

48:56.975 --> 48:58.560
because of me.

49:08.779 --> 49:10.322
It turns out...

49:13.492 --> 49:15.285
I can't protect anyone.

49:17.162 --> 49:18.914
You got that wrong, son.

49:21.249 --> 49:22.668
The love of my life...

49:23.710 --> 49:25.295
died protecting you. I'm proud of her for that.

49:36.056 --> 49:37.057
Guys!

49:38.266 --> 49:41.353
Apparently, Ichigo was in an accident!

49:41.436 --> 49:42.938
Is he okay?

49:45.482 --> 49:48.026
He's dead. He died on the spot.

49:48.110 --> 49:49.444
I'm alive.

49:50.153 --> 49:53.657
Good! Nothing kills his kind, right?

49:53.740 --> 49:55.367
Ichigo!

49:58.161 --> 49:59.871
The bandage...

50:02.416 --> 50:03.834
It's nothing.

50:38.368 --> 50:40.787
Ichigo isn't himself.

50:41.872 --> 50:43.790
Rukia ditched him?

50:43.874 --> 50:46.543
You mean, they were dating?

50:46.626 --> 50:48.462
You knew that!

50:49.004 --> 50:50.881
This is your chance, Orihime.

50:51.882 --> 50:55.177
ICHIGO KUROSAKI

50:55.260 --> 50:56.803
He's not ready.

51:04.311 --> 51:06.688
Retrieve your powers from him...

51:07.731 --> 51:08.857
and kill him.

51:10.776 --> 51:12.319
Or else, Rukia...

51:13.528 --> 51:14.905
you'll die.

51:17.240 --> 51:18.992
<i>You have until the full moon.</i>

51:35.592 --> 51:36.426
<i>Look out!</i>

51:38.512 --> 51:40.931
Get your hands off him!

51:44.059 --> 51:45.477
Hey, Rukia.

51:48.980 --> 51:50.440
That night...

51:52.734 --> 51:54.611
why did you save me?

51:59.449 --> 52:03.995
I'm nobody, but you gave me
your reaper powers...

52:05.247 --> 52:07.624
knowing it would incriminate you.

52:12.045 --> 52:13.421
That night...

52:14.756 --> 52:17.926
we both could've died.

52:23.265 --> 52:24.724
But...

52:28.144 --> 52:30.689
you saved me.

52:33.525 --> 52:35.569
Risking your own life.

52:43.827 --> 52:44.828
Rukia? Wait...

53:22.908 --> 53:23.909
He'd know!

53:37.797 --> 53:38.715
There he is!

53:40.216 --> 53:41.885
Where's Soul Society?

53:45.680 --> 53:47.265
You're so abrupt.

53:48.224 --> 53:50.769
Rukia's gone. Did she go back?

53:51.353 --> 53:52.896
How would I know?

53:52.979 --> 53:56.149
You have to tell me where Soul Society is!

53:56.232 --> 53:59.736
Then what? Will you bring her back?

54:02.364 --> 54:03.782
What if I did?

54:04.741 --> 54:06.201
Intriguing.

54:06.868 --> 54:11.498
<i>The reaper who attacked you</i>
<i>is a top combatant...</i>

54:12.082 --> 54:13.708
named Renji Abarai.

54:13.792 --> 54:15.460
Just tell me!

54:16.795 --> 54:19.172
I don't know how to get there.

54:19.255 --> 54:20.840
You don't?

54:22.300 --> 54:23.510
But...

54:24.803 --> 54:27.055
I know someone who does.

54:29.975 --> 54:34.854
<i>A reaper was exiled from Soul Society</i>
<i>and lives here.</i>

54:37.983 --> 54:38.984
What can I do?

54:41.569 --> 54:46.157
I don't think Rukia has gone back
to Soul Society.

54:47.409 --> 54:49.703
She'd be executed if she did.

54:50.537 --> 54:53.623
She wouldn't waste her life like that.

54:56.167 --> 54:59.838
I think she's trying to protect you.

55:00.880 --> 55:02.007
How?

55:04.926 --> 55:10.974
She'd risk her life by asking
her brother to spare you.

55:14.811 --> 55:16.688
To protect me.

55:18.815 --> 55:21.526
That human will attract the Grand Fisher.

55:23.028 --> 55:26.281
I'll exorcize it and redeem myself...

55:26.990 --> 55:29.075
and please the superiors.

55:29.659 --> 55:31.161
So let him live.

55:34.706 --> 55:36.082
Rukia...

55:39.961 --> 55:41.671
you have a scheme?

55:44.215 --> 55:48.136
If that's what Rukia does,

55:48.720 --> 55:51.014
she might get killed on the spot.

55:53.933 --> 55:57.604
By her ruthless brother, Byakuya.

56:03.026 --> 56:07.155
<i>You can enter Soul Society from anywhere.</i>

56:07.238 --> 56:10.784
<i>The reapers' favorite portal is near here.</i>

56:11.367 --> 56:14.120
You'd put yourself at risk for him?

56:14.204 --> 56:15.413
No.

56:15.497 --> 56:18.416
You'd disobey your older brother?

56:20.376 --> 56:22.378
You distrust me?

56:25.006 --> 56:26.674
You'd defy me...

56:27.509 --> 56:29.260
to protect him?

56:31.304 --> 56:34.015
Answer me, Rukia.

56:37.268 --> 56:38.603
Answer me.

56:41.981 --> 56:45.735
Hurry up and kill that human, Rukia.

56:47.654 --> 56:48.780
That way...

56:49.989 --> 56:51.574
you'll be pardoned.

56:57.831 --> 56:58.998
Rukia!

57:00.041 --> 57:01.751
Why not kill him?

57:01.835 --> 57:04.838
The Grand Fisher will eat him anyway!

57:05.588 --> 57:09.342
He's just bait, a piece of garbage!
Kill him!

57:09.425 --> 57:11.136
Enough!

57:20.103 --> 57:21.771
You just sit and watch.

57:22.605 --> 57:25.024
That Grand whatever-the-hell...

57:25.942 --> 57:27.819
I'll destroy it!

57:31.865 --> 57:33.658
Great timing.

57:35.076 --> 57:37.203
I'll kill him for you!

57:37.287 --> 57:38.329
Renji!

57:38.913 --> 57:39.998
Hold it.

57:43.042 --> 57:45.420
Go on. Give it a try, human.

57:46.463 --> 57:47.505
But, Captain...

57:48.423 --> 57:50.300
Destroy the Grand Fisher.

57:51.342 --> 57:52.510
Yeah.

57:53.428 --> 57:55.096
On one condition.

57:57.557 --> 57:59.309
If I succeed... you free Rukia.

58:09.944 --> 58:11.029
Rukia...

58:12.071 --> 58:14.741
complete my reaper training...

58:15.617 --> 58:17.785
and I'll defeat the Grand Fisher.

58:18.953 --> 58:23.583
And you'll get your powers back
triple fold.

58:42.060 --> 58:46.147
<i>Us reapers have pursued the Grand Fisher</i>
<i>for 54 years.</i>

58:48.775 --> 58:54.572
<i>It's more powerful and agile</i>
<i>than any Hollow we've encountered.</i>

58:57.242 --> 58:58.618
<i>It uses a lure</i>

58:59.202 --> 59:02.330
<i>to attract those</i>
<i>with strong spiritual pressure</i>

59:02.872 --> 59:04.374
<i>and preys on their souls.</i>

59:06.084 --> 59:08.294
<i>As your powers increase...</i>

59:09.504 --> 59:11.589
<i>it will be drawn to you.</i>

59:18.137 --> 59:18.972
No?

59:52.922 --> 59:54.132
Look.

59:54.215 --> 59:55.883
What's going on?

1:00:01.764 --> 1:00:04.851
Ichigo was doing kendo by the river.

1:00:04.934 --> 1:00:06.269
He was?

1:00:06.352 --> 1:00:09.397
He's training with Rukia.

1:00:09.480 --> 1:00:11.649
Ichigo? Why?

1:00:11.733 --> 1:00:14.277
-To be slim?
-An action star!

1:00:14.360 --> 1:00:15.862
-Yeah.
-Right?

1:00:15.945 --> 1:00:19.824
An action star!
Well, he has the body for it.

1:00:19.907 --> 1:00:21.951
Way to go!

1:00:24.996 --> 1:00:26.789
<i>One thing about exorcism.</i>

1:00:27.540 --> 1:00:30.293
<i>You're not killing the Hollow.</i>

1:00:31.377 --> 1:00:33.880
<i>You're redeeming its sins.</i>

1:00:35.465 --> 1:00:37.425
Go for its forehead.

1:00:38.009 --> 1:00:41.512
Even the Grand Fisher
can't tolerate being hit there.

1:00:41.596 --> 1:00:43.097
That's Grand Fisher?

1:00:43.931 --> 1:00:45.266
Kind of.

1:00:45.350 --> 1:00:47.185
I'm fighting this?

1:00:47.268 --> 1:00:48.978
I'm sure it's huge.

1:00:50.521 --> 1:00:52.690
You said it's been after me?

1:00:53.566 --> 1:00:55.485
-Right.
-Since when?

1:00:56.569 --> 1:00:59.322
Probably since you were a kid.

1:01:03.993 --> 1:01:05.703
You think I saw it?

1:01:08.289 --> 1:01:10.333
Only you know that.

1:01:11.876 --> 1:01:14.170
Grand Fisher sightings are rare.

1:01:14.921 --> 1:01:17.173
Some say it's a great beast.

1:01:17.757 --> 1:01:20.510
Others say it's like an evil flower.

1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:24.764
What was it?

1:01:26.933 --> 1:01:28.851
I mean, originally.

1:01:29.560 --> 1:01:32.480
-Sorry?
-Before it turned into a Hollow.

1:01:33.815 --> 1:01:37.193
At first, it was a girl's spirit.

1:01:41.698 --> 1:01:42.824
A girl...

1:01:51.249 --> 1:01:52.250
What's wrong?

1:01:52.333 --> 1:01:53.876
A girl's spirit...

1:01:55.211 --> 1:01:56.879
You remember something?

1:01:58.297 --> 1:01:59.549
Yes.

1:02:01.759 --> 1:02:02.802
Rukia...

1:02:06.472 --> 1:02:08.975
it sounds like this is personal.

1:02:20.069 --> 1:02:23.114
Ichigo beat up some thugs a while back.

1:02:24.365 --> 1:02:25.950
They might show up.

1:02:27.076 --> 1:02:30.496
Is he preparing for that?

1:02:32.915 --> 1:02:35.668
Your friend's up against something bigger.

1:02:38.796 --> 1:02:42.800
It might be too big for him to handle.

1:02:44.635 --> 1:02:50.183
He might die,
but he'll take up the challenge.

1:04:02.171 --> 1:04:03.214
I did it!

1:04:08.970 --> 1:04:09.846
Hey!

1:04:10.638 --> 1:04:11.472
Here!

1:04:13.766 --> 1:04:14.851
Yeah!

1:04:15.518 --> 1:04:17.687
-You did it!
-Right?

1:04:19.772 --> 1:04:22.024
-What's this?
-High five.

1:04:26.612 --> 1:04:28.281
There you go.

1:04:28.781 --> 1:04:30.199
I like that.

1:04:36.539 --> 1:04:38.541
Are you sure, Captain?

1:04:38.624 --> 1:04:41.002
He won't make it anyway.

1:04:41.961 --> 1:04:45.047
He's just bait to lure the Grand Fisher.

1:04:46.549 --> 1:04:48.801
You'll destroy the Grand Fisher.

1:04:50.720 --> 1:04:54.223
And you'll kill Rukia, too.

1:05:01.147 --> 1:05:03.774
She won't be able to kill him.

1:05:05.693 --> 1:05:07.194
She is attached to him.

1:05:09.322 --> 1:05:13.534
That's as deadly
as an ailment for a reaper.

1:05:15.369 --> 1:05:16.829
It weakens a reaper...

1:05:18.748 --> 1:05:21.542
and if it is serious, it's lethal.

1:05:26.631 --> 1:05:31.636
We're here to plan
Mom's memorial ceremony.

1:05:32.553 --> 1:05:34.764
Any ideas? Raise your hand!

1:05:34.847 --> 1:05:36.015
Me, me!

1:05:36.098 --> 1:05:37.767
Yuzu on lunch duty.

1:05:37.850 --> 1:05:41.270
Karin on flowers, incense and offerings.

1:05:41.354 --> 1:05:42.563
Don't ignore us!

1:05:42.647 --> 1:05:44.023
I raised my hand!

1:05:44.607 --> 1:05:46.692
I'm on beer duty.

1:05:46.776 --> 1:05:49.445
-That's for you.
-No way.

1:05:49.528 --> 1:05:52.156
It's for me and your mother.

1:05:53.199 --> 1:05:55.743
Bring other stuff, too.

1:06:00.331 --> 1:06:02.416
You're going on a picnic?

1:06:04.835 --> 1:06:05.795
A picnic...

1:06:07.588 --> 1:06:08.798
I guess so.

1:06:10.383 --> 1:06:12.301
We are visiting Mom's grave.

1:06:13.928 --> 1:06:18.349
Of course, my dad
and my sisters loved her.

1:06:21.143 --> 1:06:22.520
They all loved her...

1:06:24.397 --> 1:06:26.190
and I took her away from them.

1:06:28.901 --> 1:06:30.778
Is it so valuable...

1:06:32.405 --> 1:06:33.948
a family's bond?

1:06:35.992 --> 1:06:39.537
Don't you have anyone back home?

1:06:41.872 --> 1:06:42.957
I have no parents.

1:06:54.510 --> 1:06:56.303
You could stay in our world.

1:06:59.306 --> 1:07:00.975
I'll be your friend.

1:07:03.686 --> 1:07:05.146
That's impossible.

1:07:05.730 --> 1:07:07.106
Why?

1:07:07.189 --> 1:07:08.899
It's against the codes.

1:07:11.610 --> 1:07:12.945
The codes...

1:07:14.113 --> 1:07:16.490
Reapers are so inflexible.

1:07:28.753 --> 1:07:29.920
Anyway...

1:07:36.677 --> 1:07:37.762
thank you.

1:07:42.933 --> 1:07:44.769
When you say something like that...

1:07:46.604 --> 1:07:47.813
I feel happy.

1:08:21.388 --> 1:08:22.681
Up we go!

1:08:23.474 --> 1:08:29.021
I get so tired
climbing this hill every year.

1:08:29.105 --> 1:08:30.314
Come on!

1:08:31.232 --> 1:08:32.608
I'll go first.

1:08:33.526 --> 1:08:37.530
Dad, you cheat!

1:08:39.657 --> 1:08:44.495
Ichigo, can you please go down
to the vending machine?

1:08:44.578 --> 1:08:46.872
I'm so thirsty I could die.

1:08:46.956 --> 1:08:50.584
-I want pineapple juice.
-Why ask for it now?

1:08:50.668 --> 1:08:52.086
I'm thirsty now!

1:08:52.878 --> 1:08:55.089
Fine. Go on ahead.

1:08:56.966 --> 1:08:57.967
Come on.

1:09:09.270 --> 1:09:10.688
See anything?

1:09:10.771 --> 1:09:11.897
Nothing yet.

1:09:13.816 --> 1:09:17.820
MASAKI KUROSAKI

1:09:19.947 --> 1:09:22.908
Here's to you, Masaki.

1:09:36.380 --> 1:09:37.715
About Ichigo...

1:09:40.801 --> 1:09:42.469
Can't you tell him...

1:09:44.013 --> 1:09:45.723
that it's not his fault?

1:09:54.648 --> 1:09:57.109
What's that girl doing there?

1:10:16.420 --> 1:10:17.504
It's close.

1:10:22.301 --> 1:10:23.719
What's wrong?

1:10:24.303 --> 1:10:25.471
Are you okay?

1:10:42.154 --> 1:10:44.698
What's taking them so long?

1:10:57.127 --> 1:10:58.337
Grand Fisher!

1:11:04.218 --> 1:11:06.095
I knew it was you.

1:11:12.559 --> 1:11:13.602
Rukia!

1:11:15.271 --> 1:11:16.397
Ready!

1:11:20.943 --> 1:11:22.569
You killed Mom!

1:11:28.492 --> 1:11:30.452
Go behind it!

1:11:45.259 --> 1:11:46.677
Ichigo.

1:11:48.679 --> 1:11:49.763
Mom.

1:12:04.236 --> 1:12:05.571
Ichigo.

1:12:17.041 --> 1:12:18.792
How I missed you.

1:12:30.721 --> 1:12:31.805
It's an illusion!

1:12:42.691 --> 1:12:45.569
How dare you bring Mom into our fight!

1:12:45.652 --> 1:12:48.072
I've been waiting for you!

1:12:54.453 --> 1:12:57.790
Where are you, Yuzu? Karin?

1:13:00.542 --> 1:13:02.044
Sleep a while.

1:13:14.098 --> 1:13:15.391
It's begun.

1:13:22.064 --> 1:13:24.316
-What's that?
-A tornado!

1:13:27.361 --> 1:13:28.612
Run for it!

1:14:07.568 --> 1:14:08.986
A tornado!

1:14:10.821 --> 1:14:12.531
What the...

1:14:34.970 --> 1:14:36.180
Is it a tornado?

1:14:36.972 --> 1:14:38.265
Oh, my God!

1:14:42.311 --> 1:14:43.312
It's here.

1:14:55.824 --> 1:14:56.950
Guys!

1:15:00.746 --> 1:15:02.080
Ichigo...

1:15:02.664 --> 1:15:04.291
<i>They can't see me.</i>

1:15:11.507 --> 1:15:12.758
Damn!

1:15:43.372 --> 1:15:44.206
Chad.

1:15:45.832 --> 1:15:47.501
Take care of them.

1:15:52.589 --> 1:15:53.715
Ichigo...

1:15:55.551 --> 1:15:57.177
You felt him too, Chad?

1:15:58.845 --> 1:16:00.764
-What?
-Ichigo?

1:16:01.515 --> 1:16:05.435
I'm sure it was him.

1:16:10.983 --> 1:16:12.651
Everyone, out!

1:16:13.318 --> 1:16:14.903
This way!

1:16:15.654 --> 1:16:16.822
Hurry!

1:16:54.151 --> 1:16:55.068
Ichigo!

1:16:57.237 --> 1:17:02.367
I have to win this battle no matter what!

1:17:21.261 --> 1:17:22.721
That was close.

1:17:23.513 --> 1:17:24.514
You!

1:17:26.975 --> 1:17:28.185
A Quincy.

1:17:52.709 --> 1:17:54.544
Damn you!

1:17:55.462 --> 1:17:57.005
I've got this covered.

1:17:57.089 --> 1:18:00.342
I need you alive
so I can challenge you some day.

1:18:31.248 --> 1:18:34.751
You're finished!

1:19:04.948 --> 1:19:06.116
Ichigo!

1:19:12.539 --> 1:19:13.582
The forehead!

1:19:24.718 --> 1:19:25.719
<i>Did I miss?</i>

1:19:40.484 --> 1:19:42.444
Mom, I'll protect you.

1:20:23.819 --> 1:20:24.945
Ichigo!

1:20:25.862 --> 1:20:28.406
Are you okay?

1:20:47.509 --> 1:20:48.927
Thank you.

1:20:50.887 --> 1:20:52.597
Don't flatter yourself.

1:20:53.306 --> 1:20:54.975
It was my chance.

1:20:57.602 --> 1:20:59.563
You and your attitude.

1:21:07.195 --> 1:21:09.489
I'm surprised. You destroyed Grand Fisher.

1:21:16.246 --> 1:21:19.124
A Quincy will make my sword rusty.

1:21:23.378 --> 1:21:24.588
Now, die.

1:21:25.338 --> 1:21:26.673
No, Renji!

1:21:26.756 --> 1:21:27.716
Rukia...

1:21:31.052 --> 1:21:33.555
stop pretending to be a human.

1:21:41.021 --> 1:21:42.856
What's wrong, Rukia?

1:21:47.110 --> 1:21:49.946
Where's the reaper in you gone?

1:21:52.574 --> 1:21:57.078
A human and a reaper
shouldn't get emotionally involved.

1:22:01.374 --> 1:22:03.251
Kill the man.

1:22:08.173 --> 1:22:10.216
I order you to, for the last time.

1:22:15.847 --> 1:22:17.057
Rukia.

1:22:23.521 --> 1:22:24.689
You...

1:22:25.774 --> 1:22:27.233
can't be cured.

1:22:36.993 --> 1:22:38.078
Renji.

1:22:40.163 --> 1:22:41.289
Kill...

1:22:41.957 --> 1:22:43.375
both of them.

1:22:53.134 --> 1:22:55.261
Keep your word, asshole.

1:22:56.096 --> 1:22:56.972
Ichigo.

1:22:57.973 --> 1:22:59.516
I'll protect you.

1:23:02.686 --> 1:23:04.938
-No, run!
-I won't.

1:23:41.391 --> 1:23:42.851
You're slow.

1:23:45.437 --> 1:23:46.855
You're dead.

1:24:25.185 --> 1:24:26.394
Is that all?

1:25:29.916 --> 1:25:31.417
That all you've got?

1:25:42.637 --> 1:25:43.972
It's my turn.

1:25:45.515 --> 1:25:49.144
You're 2,000 years too early
to be my rival.

1:25:56.860 --> 1:25:59.612
Hear the Zabimaru roar!

1:26:48.828 --> 1:26:50.079
Adios.

1:27:11.100 --> 1:27:13.603
Looks like I killed your boyfriend.

1:27:16.898 --> 1:27:20.401
No hard feelings, Rukia.

1:27:39.003 --> 1:27:41.339
Something tells me...

1:27:46.386 --> 1:27:48.596
that you won't defeat me.

1:28:01.484 --> 1:28:03.403
<i>Is he invincible?</i>

1:28:47.113 --> 1:28:50.158
Renji... step back.

1:29:13.348 --> 1:29:14.849
Brace yourself.

1:29:31.699 --> 1:29:32.867
You're slow.

1:29:45.546 --> 1:29:46.839
Ichigo!

1:29:59.560 --> 1:30:00.895
Wait a minute.

1:30:08.986 --> 1:30:13.199
If you can stand, run!
You're no match for him!

1:30:36.389 --> 1:30:37.515
Rukia...

1:30:39.725 --> 1:30:41.519
it's time you woke up.

1:30:47.150 --> 1:30:48.484
I'll...

1:30:49.402 --> 1:30:50.945
protect her.

1:31:10.089 --> 1:31:11.841
I'm not done yet.

1:32:36.092 --> 1:32:37.426
Ichigo!

1:33:43.451 --> 1:33:45.119
Not yet.

1:33:53.711 --> 1:33:55.504
He won't give up.

1:34:01.177 --> 1:34:05.848
We're not finished yet.

1:34:08.392 --> 1:34:10.519
How dare you...

1:34:37.046 --> 1:34:38.464
You lowly human!

1:34:40.883 --> 1:34:44.929
How dare you grab my brother's cape?

1:34:51.227 --> 1:34:53.062
Move any closer...

1:34:54.688 --> 1:34:56.649
and I'll destroy you!

1:35:27.721 --> 1:35:28.848
Brother...

1:35:31.058 --> 1:35:32.768
I've awakened.

1:35:34.812 --> 1:35:36.397
I, Rukia Kuchiki...

1:35:37.982 --> 1:35:40.734
beg for my sin to be redeemed.

1:35:44.697 --> 1:35:46.323
Do you mean it?

1:35:55.583 --> 1:35:56.584
Yes.

1:36:21.775 --> 1:36:23.110
Very well.

1:36:26.864 --> 1:36:28.115
We'll return.

1:36:31.118 --> 1:36:32.161
Yes.

1:36:51.555 --> 1:36:53.265
Return my powers to me.

1:36:59.188 --> 1:37:03.567
And you'll get back the normal life
you wanted.

1:37:07.196 --> 1:37:08.531
As a result...

1:37:11.200 --> 1:37:12.868
you'll forget everything.

1:37:16.330 --> 1:37:17.790
Including me.

1:37:20.543 --> 1:37:21.919
Everything.

1:37:30.511 --> 1:37:32.721
I've had enough of humans.

1:37:34.890 --> 1:37:36.475
Especially you.

1:37:38.060 --> 1:37:40.688
You're rowdy and ill-tempered...

1:37:42.106 --> 1:37:43.649
and irresponsible!

1:38:03.419 --> 1:38:04.461
Rukia.

1:38:17.266 --> 1:38:18.601
So long...

1:38:21.312 --> 1:38:22.521
Ichigo.

1:39:31.965 --> 1:39:33.342
I was protected...

1:39:36.679 --> 1:39:37.846
again.

1:40:21.598 --> 1:40:22.975
Good morning.

1:40:23.058 --> 1:40:24.601
You slept so long.

1:40:26.061 --> 1:40:27.563
You feeling okay?

1:40:31.650 --> 1:40:33.402
I had a dream.

1:40:35.195 --> 1:40:36.780
I don't remember the details...

1:40:38.323 --> 1:40:40.033
but it was long.

1:40:50.836 --> 1:40:53.380
-You're up, Ichigo.
-Yeah.

1:40:55.507 --> 1:40:58.135
Eat well and live well.

1:40:58.886 --> 1:41:01.847
Age well till you go bald.

1:41:04.433 --> 1:41:06.226
And die smiling, son.

1:41:10.898 --> 1:41:12.941
Make your life worth living.

1:41:28.999 --> 1:41:32.586
The tornado at the train station
was devastating!

1:41:32.669 --> 1:41:34.379
Ichigo was there, too.

1:41:35.214 --> 1:41:36.632
Is he okay?

1:41:38.884 --> 1:41:40.844
-He's--
-I'm alive.

1:41:41.386 --> 1:41:44.097
Good! I knew you'd be okay.

1:41:46.934 --> 1:41:48.685
Ichigo...

1:41:51.188 --> 1:41:53.816
You look kind of different.

1:41:54.441 --> 1:41:56.944
You look... taller?

1:41:58.403 --> 1:41:59.571
No way.

1:42:00.531 --> 1:42:03.242
<i>You have my gratitude, Ichigo.</i>

1:42:04.451 --> 1:42:08.622
<i>Nobody else has ever risked</i>
<i>his life for me.</i>

1:42:08.705 --> 1:42:09.957
Good morning.

1:42:10.040 --> 1:42:10.999
Wait.

1:42:12.668 --> 1:42:14.336
Have we ever talked?

1:42:16.046 --> 1:42:17.548
No.

1:42:19.299 --> 1:42:20.592
Good to know you.

1:42:21.260 --> 1:42:22.302
Yeah.

1:42:29.768 --> 1:42:34.523
<i>I'm back in Soul Society</i>
<i>to redeem my sins,</i>

1:42:35.232 --> 1:42:37.359
<i>but I don't regret what I did.</i>

1:42:39.278 --> 1:42:41.238
<i>I made a human friend.</i>

1:42:45.826 --> 1:42:46.827
<i>But...</i>

1:42:47.619 --> 1:42:49.955
<i>everyone's memory of me...</i>

1:42:50.747 --> 1:42:52.541
<i>has been wiped clean.</i>

1:42:56.253 --> 1:42:57.379
<i>Yours, too.</i>

1:42:57.462 --> 1:42:59.965
<i>You won't remember me.</i>

1:43:02.926 --> 1:43:04.094
<i>Never.</i>

1:43:04.845 --> 1:43:08.265
MAKE A SCENE AND YOU'RE DEAD!
