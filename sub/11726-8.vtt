WEBVTT

00:10.711 --> 00:15.614
We have lost not one
Culper, but both.

00:15.616 --> 00:17.783
Robert Rogers.

00:17.785 --> 00:20.486
I should have known.

00:20.488 --> 00:23.055
He's always been a thorn
in our side, sir.

00:23.057 --> 00:27.226
Indeed, but these wounds
are self-inflicted.

00:27.228 --> 00:30.396
<i>I feel as if my eyes
have been gouged out.</i>

00:30.398 --> 00:34.133
<i>We are blind to the enemy
in New York once again.</i>

00:35.469 --> 00:40.072
Sir, I have failed you.

00:40.074 --> 00:45.411
I wish to resign my post
as head of intelligence.

00:45.413 --> 00:49.415
So, Arnold wants a second
bite of the apple, does he?

00:49.417 --> 00:51.283
"I'm so far recovered
I can walk with ease

00:51.285 --> 00:53.285
and expect to be
on horseback soon.

00:53.287 --> 00:55.721
¿10,000 shall be engaged
for my services

00:55.723 --> 00:59.625
<i>whether the contest be finished
by sword or by treaty."</i>

00:59.627 --> 01:01.393
<i>( vocalizing )</i>

01:01.395 --> 01:03.629
Hmm, requests
a meeting in person.

01:03.631 --> 01:07.366
- This could be our chance.
- <i>This could be a hoax.</i>

01:07.368 --> 01:10.269
I don't trust the man.

01:10.271 --> 01:12.571
General Arnold once told me
you can be a soldier

01:12.573 --> 01:15.274
or you can be a spy,
but you can't be both.

01:15.276 --> 01:18.477
Nonsense.
They go hand in glove.

01:18.479 --> 01:22.347
There is nothing more necessary
than good intelligence

01:22.349 --> 01:25.651
and nothing requires
greater pains to obtain.

01:25.653 --> 01:29.721
<i>You did not retreat from
the heat of battle, Ben.</i>

01:29.723 --> 01:33.292
Why are you deserting me now?

01:33.294 --> 01:36.628
Why contact us now?
Did they not exonerate him?

01:36.630 --> 01:40.466
Yes, but read closer.

01:40.468 --> 01:44.403
"I took Ticonderoga.
I triumphed at Saratoga.

01:44.405 --> 01:46.305
I defended myself
at Middlebrook,

01:46.307 --> 01:48.607
yet still they deny me
what I am owed."

01:48.609 --> 01:51.243
Middlebrook.

01:51.245 --> 01:55.147
This is strictly about his
finances now, or lack thereof.

01:55.149 --> 01:58.183
He defended himself at Middlebrook,
yes, but not in battle.

01:58.185 --> 01:59.685
From court-martial.

01:59.687 --> 02:01.587
An officer of Arnold's rank

02:01.589 --> 02:03.789
must be tried
by a jury of his peers.

02:03.791 --> 02:07.192
The only place to find
that many generals

02:07.194 --> 02:10.362
would be the rebel camp itself.

02:10.364 --> 02:12.865
Washington is at Middlebrook.

02:19.473 --> 02:22.574
I do not accept
your resignation.

02:22.576 --> 02:27.346
We may have lost
our man in New York,

02:27.348 --> 02:30.682
but we have not lost
our woman there.

02:30.684 --> 02:36.255
Sir, a foray against Washington's
camp would be perilous.

02:36.257 --> 02:38.790
<i>Were the regulars
to march out of New York,</i>

02:38.792 --> 02:41.293
the rebels would
surely be alerted.

02:41.295 --> 02:44.229
I'll dispatch the provincial
militia from Stony Point.

02:44.231 --> 02:47.499
Give Bill Tryon
a crack at the old fox.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.635
Washington will never
see them coming.

02:49.637 --> 02:52.204
Washington will never
see Arnold coming.

02:52.206 --> 02:55.407
We have no need of Arnold.

02:55.409 --> 02:59.211
He's stuck in
Philadelphia, as are you.

02:59.213 --> 03:02.314
You haven't been the same
since we left there, John.

03:02.316 --> 03:05.284
You're seeking
to win back a woman

03:05.286 --> 03:07.819
while I am trying
to end this war.

The standard bearer was shot.

04:12.786 --> 04:15.287
They used the colors
as a tourniquet.

04:15.289 --> 04:16.654
Where was this?

04:16.656 --> 04:18.523
Franklin Township.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.361
Ben, you all right?

04:22.363 --> 04:24.396
Yes.

04:24.398 --> 04:26.832
I just hope it can be mended.

04:29.637 --> 04:33.605
I... I spoke
with Washington

04:33.607 --> 04:35.474
about the ring.

04:35.476 --> 04:38.644
And, well, he reminded me

04:38.646 --> 04:42.014
that we do still have one
asset left to us in New York.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.651
Abigail?

04:46.954 --> 04:49.888
I haven't heard from her
since I sent Cicero back.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.958
Well, perhaps it's time you
renewed your acquaintance, then.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.593
( sighs )

04:54.595 --> 04:55.861
I have no way to contact her.

04:55.863 --> 04:57.696
You could pay her a visit.

04:57.698 --> 05:00.799
A man we'd have
to smuggle into the city.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.801
You can enter on a pass.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.770
Abigail can't get me a pass.

05:04.772 --> 05:07.506
No, but an officer can.

05:16.750 --> 05:19.518
I haven't exchanged
a word with Ed...

05:20.888 --> 05:22.854
with Major Hewlett

05:22.856 --> 05:24.856
since I left him at the altar.

05:24.858 --> 05:27.726
Right, so maybe
he wants some answers.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.961
I can't lie to him again.

05:29.963 --> 05:33.398
Anna, just think of it
as doing your duty.

05:33.400 --> 05:34.966
All right? For Washington.
For your country.

05:34.968 --> 05:38.470
A lie for my country
is still a lie.

05:42.743 --> 05:47.579
Sometimes you ask
too much of people.

05:51.719 --> 05:53.685
I know.

06:02.896 --> 06:05.630
I know there's nothing
more painful for you.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.869
Nor is there anything more
necessary for the cause.

06:14.708 --> 06:18.977
We make sacrifices so that
others don't have to.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.687
Anna's voice:
<i>"Dear Edmund...</i>

06:32.659 --> 06:34.760
<i>I write to you
with a heavy heart</i>

06:34.762 --> 06:37.763
<i>and against my better instincts,</i>

06:37.765 --> 06:39.898
<i>but write I must,</i>

06:39.900 --> 06:42.934
<i>though I suppose you never
wished to hear from me again.</i>

06:42.936 --> 06:47.506
<i>If that is the case,

06:47.508 --> 06:49.808
<i>( men laughing )</i>

06:51.612 --> 06:53.845

<i>so that this gaping wound
can, if not be healed,</i>

06:57.951 --> 06:59.918
<i>then at least be closed.</i>

06:59.920 --> 07:02.721
<i>Such sorrow, however,</i>

07:02.723 --> 07:05.891
<i>cannot be conveyed

07:05.893 --> 07:09.060

( laughing )

07:13.634 --> 07:16.601
I'll drink to that!

07:16.603 --> 07:20.772
Gentlemen, we are about to
change the course of history.

07:20.774 --> 07:23.642
And to the victors
go the spoils.

07:23.644 --> 07:26.044
Honors and riches
and girls with no britches.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.680
( laughing )

07:31.018 --> 07:33.585
I've been spoiling for another
chance at Washington.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.987
I intend to flank him
and collapse his center

07:35.989 --> 07:37.789
as I did to Arnold
at Ridgefield.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.025
It seems I chose the right man.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.995
I would caution you, William,

07:43.997 --> 07:46.665
not to deal the rebels
too heavy a blow.

07:46.667 --> 07:47.999
How's that?

07:48.001 --> 07:50.902
Cooke wants the war to
end, but not just yet.

07:50.904 --> 07:53.572
My fields on Long Island have
never been more numerous.

07:53.574 --> 07:55.006
Nor more profitable.

07:55.008 --> 07:58.043
- ( laughing )
- To Washington's health.

07:58.045 --> 08:01.513
May he survive the battle
long enough to hang.

08:01.515 --> 08:03.982
- ( laughing )
- There you are.

08:05.586 --> 08:08.086
Mr. Townsend,
if you please.

08:08.088 --> 08:09.521
Townsend.

08:09.523 --> 08:10.589
Psst.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.158
More Madeira.

08:21.535 --> 08:25.770
General Clinton, it is an honor
to have you in our presence.

08:25.772 --> 08:29.608
I intend to be back with
something to celebrate.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.543
Perhaps I shall leave
the bottle, gentlemen,

08:31.545 --> 08:33.245
so that you will not
be disturbed.

08:36.884 --> 08:39.717
Um, Townsend.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.953
My sources say
big things are afoot.

08:41.955 --> 08:43.822
- Is that so?
- Yes.

08:43.823 --> 08:46.091
We better stock up.
Business will be booming.

08:46.093 --> 08:48.126
That's a pity.
I was thinking

08:48.128 --> 08:50.862
of traveling back to Oyster
Bay to visit my father

08:50.864 --> 08:54.733
and perhaps, James,
to remain there.

08:54.735 --> 08:57.202
I'm thinking
of selling my stake.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.704
( chuckles ) Well,
you'll change your tune

08:59.706 --> 09:01.840
as soon as you read
Saturday's headlines.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.642
I'm quite sure I won't.

09:03.644 --> 09:06.945
But I assure you the news

- What?

11:31.958 --> 11:34.726
Yeah, that's what I thought
when I saw her at Whitehall

11:34.728 --> 11:37.128
running around with your rifle.

11:37.130 --> 11:40.231
Now hurry up and show him some

I'm still finding out.

11:52.245 --> 11:54.312
We need to get out of here.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.314
All of us.
Right now.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.249
Yeah, well, there's
a problem with that.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.985
Thanks to your wife,
I ain't got a boat.

12:04.191 --> 12:07.192

Plus a few on the groom's side.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.240
20? In total?

12:22.242 --> 12:24.843
I had more bridesmaids.

12:24.845 --> 12:27.112
Not everyone can be
accommodated at short notice.

12:27.114 --> 12:28.980
What will I tell my friends?

12:28.982 --> 12:31.783
Would you prefer to tell
them your daughter eloped?

12:31.785 --> 12:34.185
This is all so sudden, Peggy.

12:34.187 --> 12:38.189
- <i>( door opens )</i>
- Is there another guest on the way?

12:38.191 --> 12:42.160
- No, Mother.
- <i>( door closes )</i>

12:42.162 --> 12:45.864
Every time I'm here, there seem
to be fewer and fewer servants.

12:45.866 --> 12:48.967
Won't be long before
we outnumber them.

12:48.969 --> 12:51.202
Haven't you been reimbursed
by the Congress yet?

12:51.204 --> 12:53.872
You needn't worry, sir.
I will get what I am owed.

12:53.874 --> 12:56.975
I've been offered command
of the fort at West Point.

12:56.977 --> 12:58.977
West Point?

12:58.979 --> 13:01.312
It's not a field command, but
it's a very important position.

13:01.314 --> 13:04.983
Who better to command Fort Arnold
than the man it's named after?

13:04.985 --> 13:08.153
Am I not to remain
in Philadelphia?

13:08.155 --> 13:10.321
Who will oversee Penn Mansion?

13:10.323 --> 13:13.158
Well, whomever
I sell it to, I suppose.

13:13.160 --> 13:17.395
But you just had it restored.

Cavil, you're to stand
down from your post.

13:38.852 --> 13:41.386
I require you for a guard duty.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.357
What happened?

13:46.359 --> 13:49.360
Did he do that to you?

13:49.362 --> 13:51.362
You said Rogers
had you watching someone.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.932
- Tell me again, who was it?
- My wife and child.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.333
- How are they?
- Answer the question.

13:55.335 --> 13:59.237
Answer mine.

13:59.239 --> 14:02.040
Mrs. Woodhull braved the entire
assault from her bathtub.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.008
I believe the boy
slept through it.

14:12.953 --> 14:14.986
It was John Robeson,
as I already told you.

14:14.988 --> 14:18.223
Would you swear to that on the
lives of your wife and child?

14:18.225 --> 14:20.091
And on my own.

14:22.429 --> 14:25.363
- Come with us.
- ( horse snorts )

14:35.308 --> 14:39.043
I knew it.
Bloody well knew it.

14:39.045 --> 14:41.312
Washington's made
a pact with the devil.

14:41.314 --> 14:44.983
He's promised Rochambeau
if the rebels win,

14:44.985 --> 14:47.018
the French can help themselves
to all of New England.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.286
<i>Allemachtig!</i>

14:48.288 --> 14:51.322
Are you saying across
the sound would be France?

14:51.324 --> 14:54.259
It ain't ever
gonna happen, though.

14:54.261 --> 14:56.227
Excuse us.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.162
Not you.

15:00.467 --> 15:05.336
I know you killed Captain Joyce.

15:05.338 --> 15:06.471
What?

15:06.473 --> 15:08.439
No, no, no.
It was Clayton.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.375
That's what Robert Rogers
said to protect you.

15:10.377 --> 15:12.277
Isn't that right, Woodhull?

15:12.279 --> 15:14.279
It was him.
He's the murderer.

15:14.281 --> 15:16.247
He's the one trying
to cover his...

15:16.249 --> 15:18.383
Where is Robert Rogers?

15:18.385 --> 15:19.984
I swear I haven't
seen him in years.

15:19.986 --> 15:22.287
- Then where's your boat?
- My boat?

15:22.288 --> 15:24.589
The one you used to smuggle on the London
trade, the boat he used to evade me.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.424
We found his craft
near Frog's Cove.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.959
When we searched for yours,
we found it missing.

15:27.961 --> 15:29.260
My boat's gone?
( grunts )

15:29.262 --> 15:31.562
Woodhull was assigned
to watch you.

15:31.564 --> 15:33.464
Who were you assigned to watch?

15:33.466 --> 15:36.134
- Nobody.
- Who else does Rogers control?!

15:36.136 --> 15:39.170
( screaming )

15:40.373 --> 15:43.041
<i>( moaning )</i>

15:47.247 --> 15:51.049
Who did Rogers
have you watching?

15:56.990 --> 15:58.690
( exhales )

16:08.401 --> 16:10.134
It was an accident.

16:10.136 --> 16:11.536
He should have been
more careful.

16:13.173 --> 16:15.440
( chatter )

16:27.053 --> 16:29.287
Not the first time I've had
to carry him out of here.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.389
Spent a lot of time
in the tavern, did he?

16:31.391 --> 16:34.292
- Boone: You'd think he owned the place.
- Aye.

16:41.434 --> 16:44.035
Robeson was your best customer?

16:44.037 --> 16:46.237
I wouldn't say so, no.
He owed me money.

16:46.239 --> 16:48.773
Then why didn't you collect?

16:48.775 --> 16:50.675
Woodhull was watching Robeson.

16:50.677 --> 16:53.111
Robeson was watching you.

16:54.614 --> 16:57.415
- What?
- He knew all their dirty secrets.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.550
- And yours.
- What secret?

16:59.552 --> 17:01.652
The one you're going to tell me.

17:01.654 --> 17:04.388
But I don't...
I don't have any...

17:04.391 --> 17:07.558
my rum, my rum!
I buy it from a privateer.

17:07.560 --> 17:11.396
- The London trade?
- Yeah, yeah. The black market.

17:11.397 --> 17:13.564
That's all I did.
I swear!

17:13.566 --> 17:16.534
I don't even know Roger Roberts.

17:16.536 --> 17:19.569
( horse snorts, nickers )

17:19.571 --> 17:21.638
You come from
far afield, mister?

17:21.641 --> 17:24.474
All the way from York City.

17:29.582 --> 17:32.250
I'm thinking
of selling my business

17:32.252 --> 17:34.619
and I heard there was land here

17:34.621 --> 17:37.422
going for cheap previously
owned by rebels.

17:39.626 --> 17:43.161
Well, Setauket's a sleepy town
compared to what you're used to.

17:43.163 --> 17:44.395
<i>( door opens )</i>

17:45.331 --> 17:47.165
Please don't kill me!

17:47.167 --> 17:50.568
- <i>( people murmuring )</i>
- Please help me!

17:50.570 --> 17:51.736
I'm innocent!

17:51.738 --> 17:53.604
I'll be the judge of that.

17:53.606 --> 17:56.374
<i>( crowd murmuring )</i>

17:58.611 --> 18:03.247
People of Setauket,
pay close attention.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.318
( crying )

18:19.299 --> 18:20.598
( people gasp )

18:22.302 --> 18:24.602
<i>( horse whinnies )</i>

18:24.604 --> 18:26.637
<i>- ( goat bleats )
- ( bell jingles )</i>

18:26.639 --> 18:28.673
<i>( chatter )</i>

18:28.675 --> 18:30.475
Which of these people

18:30.477 --> 18:33.277
did Rogers command you to watch?

18:33.279 --> 18:34.745
I want names!

18:34.747 --> 18:37.281
DeJong:
<i>I haven't any.</i>

18:37.283 --> 18:39.484
<i>With God as my witness,</i>

18:39.486 --> 18:43.654
<i>I... I would tell you
if I did!</i>

18:43.656 --> 18:45.389
I want names!

18:45.391 --> 18:48.359
( sobbing )

18:50.163 --> 18:52.697
You poor pathetic soul.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.534
I know what's bedeviling you.

18:58.171 --> 19:01.539
You're scared of Robert Rogers.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.743
But you should be scared of me.

19:05.745 --> 19:09.180
<i>Whatever he's
threatened you with</i>

19:09.182 --> 19:12.583
is nothing compared
to what I will do

19:12.585 --> 19:17.455
unless those aiding and
abetting him come forward.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.657
<i>( people murmuring )</i>

19:22.295 --> 19:24.495
<i>( goat bleats )</i>

19:28.635 --> 19:31.335
So be it.

19:31.337 --> 19:35.740
I will raze this town if I must!

19:37.644 --> 19:39.377
( woman gasps )

19:39.379 --> 19:42.313
Jesus, that poor man.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.228
( whispering ) What
are you doing here?

19:57.230 --> 19:59.931
I was going to ask myself
the same thing.

20:01.734 --> 20:03.601
Lovely town, by the way.

20:03.603 --> 20:06.470
Can't imagine why
I didn't visit earlier.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.607
I'll set off towards my farm.

20:09.609 --> 20:12.310
Wait two minutes, then follow.

20:19.752 --> 20:22.553
<i>( birds chirping )</i>

20:22.555 --> 20:24.589
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.626
<i>( bird calling )</i>

20:38.671 --> 20:40.871
- You're being followed?
- Yeah, yeah.

20:40.873 --> 20:42.573
- No, no, no. It's Townsend.
- What?

20:42.575 --> 20:44.275
Townsend.

20:44.277 --> 20:45.776
Dear God, what is that smell?

20:45.778 --> 20:48.346
( clears throat )

20:48.348 --> 20:49.814
Morning.

20:49.816 --> 20:52.617
- What's he doing here?
- Getting me out of town.

20:52.619 --> 20:54.719
Are we taking him as well?

20:54.721 --> 20:56.721
I'm not going anywhere with you.

20:56.722 --> 20:58.722
Listen, listen, you came here
for a reason, all right?

20:58.725 --> 21:02.260
- We don't have time for old grudges.
- Just shut it.

21:02.262 --> 21:04.762
The man has his rights.

21:04.764 --> 21:07.531
And we do have business
to square, so...

21:08.901 --> 21:11.702
I'm sorry what happened
to your father.

21:11.704 --> 21:13.671
Abe's orders
were as clear as day.

21:13.673 --> 21:16.507
He was not to be touched.
So that's on me.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.513
It should've never happened.

21:26.653 --> 21:29.654
You can knock me if you like
to even things up.

21:29.656 --> 21:31.889
- Caleb.
- I'm serious. Eye for an eye.

21:31.891 --> 21:34.358
- Caleb, he's a Quaker. He doesn't believe...
- ( grunts )

21:34.360 --> 21:36.460
Jesus!

21:36.462 --> 21:38.696
Knew I loved this bastard.

21:38.698 --> 21:39.930
- Abe: <i>All right, quiet.
- ( Caleb groans )</i>

21:39.932 --> 21:43.534
Robert, you need
to start talking.

21:43.536 --> 21:45.670
- We thought you were out.
- I am.

21:45.672 --> 21:47.738
But this is bigger than me.

21:47.740 --> 21:51.342
This needs to get
to Washington with haste.

21:51.344 --> 21:52.710
They know where your camp is.

21:52.712 --> 21:54.478
It's only a matter of time.

21:55.882 --> 21:57.648
Shite.

21:57.650 --> 22:00.885
Well, I got Robeson's boat
stashed at the Fingers.

22:00.887 --> 22:05.356
I heard. Simcoe thought
he lent it to Rogers.

22:05.358 --> 22:07.692
Killed Robeson
right in front of me.

22:07.693 --> 22:10.053
Jesus. Well, let's grab your
family and get you out of here.

22:13.466 --> 22:14.732
No.

22:14.734 --> 22:16.600
- <i>No?</i>
- No.

22:18.438 --> 22:21.038
Townsend is right.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.957
There's no time
to waste, all right?

22:22.958 --> 22:24.875
- You'll be faster without us.
- Woody, I'm not leaving here without you.

22:24.877 --> 22:26.610
I can't go, Caleb.

22:26.612 --> 22:28.913
<i>I can't go as it stands alright.
Simcoe, he's chasing a ghost.</i>

22:28.915 --> 22:30.881
I'm the one who set him off.
He will burn down Setauket.

22:30.883 --> 22:33.751
No, he will burn you.
That is what he'll do.

22:36.589 --> 22:38.556
Look, this man had every
reason to run, all right?

22:38.558 --> 22:41.492
But instead he ran to us.

22:41.494 --> 22:43.527
'Cause he's the only man
who could.

22:43.529 --> 22:47.431
Now, if you don't get this
to Washington, who will?

22:47.433 --> 22:51.936
If I don't stand up
to Simcoe, who will?

23:05.017 --> 23:08.586
I was wondering if there had
been any callers from town.

23:08.588 --> 23:11.655
Someone who may have brought
information on Rogers.

23:11.657 --> 23:13.758
No.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.459
Pity.

23:15.461 --> 23:17.628
They leave me no choice.

23:17.630 --> 23:19.497
I'm compelled
to strike at random

23:19.499 --> 23:21.499
until the conspiracy
comes to light.

23:21.501 --> 23:22.967
No, surely there's a better way.

23:22.969 --> 23:25.536
If there is,
I'm not aware of it.

23:25.538 --> 23:27.938
Though as magistrate, you know
this town better than anyone.

23:27.940 --> 23:30.975
You already have a list
of suspected Whigs

23:30.977 --> 23:33.611
and of people who haven't
paid their taxes to the king.

23:33.613 --> 23:37.782
Rogers is too clever to be found
amongst the usual suspects.

23:37.784 --> 23:40.451
What makes you so sure
he's still here?

23:40.453 --> 23:42.486
<i>He missed his chance
to kill you.</i>

23:42.488 --> 23:44.622
A clever man
would cut his losses.

23:44.624 --> 23:46.624
But he and I are cut
from the same cloth.

23:46.626 --> 23:50.094
Neither of us will cease until
our enemy has been destroyed.

23:51.764 --> 23:54.765
What I require are secrets.

23:54.767 --> 24:00.171
Greed, revenge, perversions.

24:00.173 --> 24:03.474
The sort of secrets that cannot
be hidden in a small town.

24:03.476 --> 24:05.910
The sort of secrets that can
be used against someone.

24:07.680 --> 24:09.013
Not by me, of course,

24:09.015 --> 24:10.748
but by Rogers.

24:16.589 --> 24:20.925
If you give me time,
I will draw up a list

24:20.927 --> 24:22.893
based upon what I know.

24:22.895 --> 24:25.629
Be quick about it.

24:25.631 --> 24:28.999
<i>There's no telling
when Rogers will strike next.</i>

24:29.001 --> 24:31.635
Any old iron?

24:33.506 --> 24:34.805
Philomena:
<i>Thank you.</i>

24:34.807 --> 24:36.140
I'll see you tomorrow.

24:39.846 --> 24:42.079
Any old iron?

24:43.916 --> 24:47.051
Any old iron?

24:49.055 --> 24:50.855
Hello, Philomena.

24:50.857 --> 24:53.858
Have we...

24:53.860 --> 24:56.861
- Robert Rogers?
- In the flesh.

24:56.863 --> 24:58.996
<i>( laughs ) Haven't seen
you since the disaster.</i>

24:58.998 --> 25:01.599
- Major Rogers.
- Aye.

25:01.601 --> 25:03.133
You're a wanted man.

25:03.135 --> 25:06.036
I can cut your throat faster
than you can scream for help.

25:06.038 --> 25:10.574
Now, I have it
on very good authority

25:10.576 --> 25:13.043
that you have taken up
with the major again.

25:13.045 --> 25:14.712
We're not together, I swear.

25:14.714 --> 25:18.849
Don't try to play me.
I have seen your acting.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.985
Either you're going to help me

25:20.987 --> 25:22.987
to give the major
his comeuppance

25:22.989 --> 25:25.155
or you're going to get it.

25:25.157 --> 25:27.925
You don't have to force me to betray him.
He already has that coming.

25:27.927 --> 25:30.027
He's a liar and a cad.

25:30.029 --> 25:32.196
I did everything he asked
and how does he thank me?

25:32.198 --> 25:35.866
By dressing me up like some
trollop from Philadelphia.

25:35.868 --> 25:37.735
Aye.

25:37.737 --> 25:42.072
And after he's used you up,
he throws you away, hmm?

25:44.577 --> 25:46.210
What do you want?

25:46.212 --> 25:48.879
I aim to know the major's
comings and goings,

25:48.881 --> 25:51.015
but seeing as I am a wanted man,

25:51.017 --> 25:54.084
well, there are places
I cannot go.

25:54.086 --> 25:56.120
But you can.

25:59.659 --> 26:01.926
( chatter )

26:09.669 --> 26:11.702
- <i>( music playing )</i>
- ( chatter )

26:11.704 --> 26:14.205
Major Hewlett,

26:14.206 --> 26:16.707
there's a young lady who bears
a pass with your signature.

26:20.913 --> 26:23.981
If you won't admit her, may I?

26:38.698 --> 26:40.931
Major Hewlett.

26:40.933 --> 26:42.933
Mrs. Strong.

26:42.935 --> 26:45.069
May we speak privately?

26:45.071 --> 26:48.639
Anything you have to say
to me can be said here.

27:01.253 --> 27:03.387
You look well.

27:03.389 --> 27:06.690
Well, looks can be
deceiving, as you know.

27:08.127 --> 27:10.294
I'm still an officer,
but it's merely a formality.

27:10.296 --> 27:14.164
I'll be cashiered once I
make it back to England.

27:19.305 --> 27:21.639
It... it wasn't my aim
to disgrace you.

27:21.641 --> 27:24.775
Yes, it was.
In order to save me.

27:28.814 --> 27:31.348
You knew that the judge
would challenge

27:31.350 --> 27:33.017
the authenticity of the divorce.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.688
How did you know that I
would take the blame?

27:41.327 --> 27:43.894
Because of who you are.

27:43.896 --> 27:46.263
The kind of man
that can't beat Simcoe.

27:46.265 --> 27:48.966
- No
- I could have taken him. I took him before.

27:48.968 --> 27:51.702
I wasn't protecting
you from Simcoe.

27:53.673 --> 27:55.372
It was Abraham.

27:58.110 --> 28:01.879
He was plotting to kill you.

28:01.881 --> 28:06.083
Why didn't you warn me?

28:06.085 --> 28:08.185
Because I was a spy, too.

28:14.026 --> 28:17.061
I had to choose
between the two of you

28:17.063 --> 28:19.463
and I found a third way.

28:19.465 --> 28:21.365
I figured it was better for you

28:21.367 --> 28:24.268
to fall on your own sword
than to perish from his.

28:24.270 --> 28:26.236
<i>( cup thuds )</i>

28:29.709 --> 28:32.176
You've played me for a fool.

28:32.178 --> 28:35.279
When you jumped out of that boat,
I thought it was out of loyalty.

28:35.281 --> 28:38.348
It was, for my country.

28:38.350 --> 28:41.351
And for Abe.

28:42.722 --> 28:44.421
At first...

28:44.423 --> 28:48.726
I encouraged your
affections to protect him.

28:48.728 --> 28:51.328
But as you and I grew closer,

28:51.330 --> 28:56.033
I discovered you were
a man of honor,

28:56.035 --> 28:57.101
of intellect,

28:57.103 --> 29:02.806
of kindness.

29:02.808 --> 29:05.008
Why did you come here?

29:06.879 --> 29:10.013
To give you the truth.

29:10.015 --> 29:10.881
You deserve it.

29:10.883 --> 29:13.250
I mean, why were you sent?

29:16.021 --> 29:17.855
Look around, Edmund.

29:17.857 --> 29:19.823
You could have me arrested.

29:19.825 --> 29:23.160
I chose to tell you this
on my own accord

29:23.162 --> 29:25.429
and against my orders

29:25.431 --> 29:29.066
because I cannot
tell another lie

29:29.068 --> 29:31.301
to a man who never lied to me.

29:36.342 --> 29:39.143
Did you ever love me?

29:46.252 --> 29:49.953
When I proposed we leave America

29:49.955 --> 29:52.256
and marry, I meant that.

29:52.258 --> 29:54.491
Answer my question.

29:57.029 --> 30:00.097
Did you ever love me?

30:16.448 --> 30:21.185
We were both swept up
by our passions.

30:21.187 --> 30:23.220
I by my infatuation with you,

30:23.222 --> 30:28.258
and you by your love
for a married man.

30:31.230 --> 30:34.398
It is good that
you've quit Abraham.

30:37.002 --> 30:39.036
Now I must quit you.

30:51.383 --> 30:53.417
<i>( door opens )</i>

30:55.554 --> 30:57.187
<i>( door closes )</i>

31:02.928 --> 31:05.028
( chatter )

31:08.968 --> 31:11.101
What on earth?
Caleb?

31:11.103 --> 31:15.072
Compliments of Culper...
Jr. and Sr.

31:15.074 --> 31:16.273
What?

31:16.275 --> 31:17.975
Where is he?
Where is Abe?

31:17.977 --> 31:21.011
Setauket. Ring's not as
dead as you thought.

31:23.015 --> 31:26.350
"Washington Trounced
in Tryon Triumph."

31:26.352 --> 31:30.454
There's a ring to it. Yet I
wonder if that rings false.

31:30.456 --> 31:34.024
Not long ago you informed me
that Culper Jr. had quit.

31:34.026 --> 31:37.461
Now he's riding to Setauket
as if he were Paul Revere.

31:37.463 --> 31:39.563
<i>Perhaps he was driven
to the enemy.</i>

31:39.565 --> 31:41.265
Or perhaps he's just
settling scores.

31:41.267 --> 31:42.599
No, sir.
He settled them.

31:42.601 --> 31:44.568
He got it out
of his system, trust me.

31:44.570 --> 31:47.304
In any case, the enemy knows
precisely where we are.

31:47.306 --> 31:49.006
We must decamp
beyond harm's way.

31:49.008 --> 31:50.607
What, and let Clinton
get the better of us?

31:50.609 --> 31:53.176
Sir, rather than merely
dodging a blow,

31:53.178 --> 31:56.513
why not hit back so hard that he'll
think twice about ever trying it again?

31:56.515 --> 32:00.617
This credits the victory to
Governor Tryon's Tory militia,

32:00.619 --> 32:04.388
which we know to be
stationed at Stony Point.

32:04.390 --> 32:08.425
Now, surely he'll devote most
of his forces to the attack,

32:08.427 --> 32:11.495
leaving the garrison
undermanned.

32:11.497 --> 32:13.330
A small force of light infantry

32:13.332 --> 32:16.633
could penetrate their defenses
under the cover of darkness.

32:16.635 --> 32:21.605
I thought one couldn't be
a soldier and a spy.

32:25.945 --> 32:28.011
We set off at sundown.

32:28.013 --> 32:31.181
Now, Lieutenant Brewster
is passing out pieces of paper

32:31.183 --> 32:34.017
that will help you
distinguish friend from foe.

32:34.019 --> 32:37.054
Right, pin them on your noggin,

32:37.056 --> 32:39.489
anywhere you don't
want to get nicked.

32:39.491 --> 32:42.526
- ( men chuckle )
- And once inside the fort...

32:44.430 --> 32:47.197
kill any man not wearing one.

32:47.199 --> 32:49.533
<i>( birds screeching )</i>

32:56.342 --> 33:00.477
Tryon: <i>Abscissa
caputserpentis</i> et emoritur.

33:03.115 --> 33:06.350
Cut off the head of the snake
and the body will die.

33:06.352 --> 33:09.152
Our target
is the officers' tents,

33:09.154 --> 33:11.588
specifically Washington's.

33:11.590 --> 33:14.458
A prize of ¿500 to the man

33:14.460 --> 33:17.361
who captures or kills him.

33:17.363 --> 33:20.664
We only have need of bayonets.

33:22.601 --> 33:25.369
Remove the flints
from your weapons.

33:25.371 --> 33:28.138
( men muttering )

33:28.140 --> 33:31.341
We can't risk any sound that
might give away our position.

33:32.578 --> 33:36.646
We take them by surprise
or we die.

34:01.140 --> 34:04.274
Charge your bayonets.

34:05.544 --> 34:08.411
To the front, march.

34:26.697 --> 34:28.431
( grunts )

34:28.434 --> 34:31.268
( echoes ) Where in the
hell are the rebels?!

34:35.541 --> 34:37.507
( grunts )

34:37.509 --> 34:39.509
( gunshot )

34:45.317 --> 34:48.552
- We're under attack!
- ( men shouting )

34:48.554 --> 34:51.353
Go! To arms!

35:04.470 --> 35:06.369
( gunshot )

35:17.416 --> 35:19.683
- We yield! We yield!
- Hold! Hold!

35:19.685 --> 35:22.385
- Hold, hold, hold!
- Give us quarter!

35:22.387 --> 35:24.821
Cease, men!
Cease!

35:28.327 --> 35:30.293
The fort is ours!

35:30.295 --> 35:33.463
( cheering )

36:00.726 --> 36:02.826
<i>( birds chirping )</i>

36:11.737 --> 36:13.803
How's your wound, Captain?

36:15.541 --> 36:17.741
I must confess
it still pains me.

36:17.743 --> 36:19.743
But I consider myself fortunate.

36:19.745 --> 36:22.812
An inch or two closer and my life
would have been extinguished.

36:25.417 --> 36:26.783
You needn't worry.

36:26.785 --> 36:29.686
It's Rogers who will
soon be snuffed out.

36:29.688 --> 36:34.558
Captain, a word if we may.

36:34.560 --> 36:37.177
I haven't finished my breakfast.

36:37.178 --> 36:39.795
<i>Whatever you need to say can be
said in front of Mrs. Woodhull.</i>

36:42.334 --> 36:43.800
I have that list.

36:45.604 --> 36:47.837
Ah, the names.

36:51.877 --> 36:53.910
Who'd have thought
a town this size

36:53.912 --> 36:56.746
could have so many secrets?

36:56.748 --> 37:00.483
I would appreciate if we kept the
source of this information between us.

37:00.485 --> 37:02.786
It'll be our secret.

37:09.661 --> 37:11.661
You're giving him names?

37:11.663 --> 37:13.530
Why are you helping him?

37:13.532 --> 37:17.467
You of all people
have no right to judge me.

37:25.811 --> 37:29.879
Clinton: <i>Look at him.
In his cups.</i>

37:29.881 --> 37:32.816
We should never have sent the
militia in place of the regulars.

37:32.818 --> 37:35.518
It's like sending boys
to do men's work.

37:35.520 --> 37:38.922
I beg to differ. The result
wouldn't have been any different.

37:38.924 --> 37:40.991
( cracks )

37:43.262 --> 37:45.328
They knew we were coming.

37:46.632 --> 37:48.898
We have a traitor in our ranks.

37:50.702 --> 37:52.736
Gentlemen.

38:02.714 --> 38:04.714
What are we burning?

38:04.716 --> 38:06.850
Old news.

38:12.624 --> 38:15.558
Washington: <i>It's a pity that
no one can know about this.</i>

38:15.560 --> 38:19.429
It would have made
quite the memento.

38:19.431 --> 38:22.599
Well, we have plenty
of other mementos, sir.

38:22.601 --> 38:25.535
11 field pieces,
among them seven cannons,

38:25.537 --> 38:28.705
93 men taken.

38:28.707 --> 38:30.674
Yes.

38:30.676 --> 38:34.477
And we can exchange them for some
of ours taken in Charleston.

38:34.479 --> 38:37.947
Well, not before I have a chance
to interrogate the officers.

38:37.949 --> 38:41.785
We must find out who gave away
the location of our camp.

38:41.787 --> 38:44.921
You think it's one of our own?

38:44.923 --> 38:49.059
Well, they would never have committed so
many men to the attack if it weren't.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.663
<i>( knocks )</i>

38:55.734 --> 38:58.435
- Miss Anna!
- Oh!

38:58.437 --> 39:00.837
Oh, I can't believe
how you've grown.

39:00.839 --> 39:03.540
<i>And how old I feel saying that.</i>

39:03.542 --> 39:06.076
Abigail.

39:06.078 --> 39:07.944
It's good to see you.

39:09.981 --> 39:12.849
I'm... I'm sorry
I stopped by unannounced.

39:12.851 --> 39:15.518
I just wanted to see you
before I left the city.

39:17.956 --> 39:20.690
The major won't be home
until nightfall.

39:20.692 --> 39:22.359
Have some tea.

39:25.030 --> 39:28.031
Engaged?
My goodness.

39:28.033 --> 39:29.966
I never knew you had
feelings for him.

39:29.968 --> 39:32.635
Neither did I.

39:32.637 --> 39:35.672
But it wasn't meant to be.

39:35.674 --> 39:37.640
Is it ever?

39:39.611 --> 39:42.078
When Akinbode
brought Cicero back,

39:42.080 --> 39:44.814
he asked me to run away
with him to Canada.

39:44.816 --> 39:46.850
I wasn't ready.

39:46.852 --> 39:49.018
Besides, I didn't need
a man to lead me.

39:49.020 --> 39:51.020
I can go on my own.

39:52.491 --> 39:54.491
But I miss him.

39:54.493 --> 39:57.727
And now it seems
he's gone for good.

39:57.729 --> 39:59.963
<i>( clock ticking )</i>

40:01.099 --> 40:02.766
I'm sorry.

40:02.768 --> 40:05.635
He had to look out for himself.

40:05.637 --> 40:07.003
And so do you.

40:07.005 --> 40:09.639
You need to do
what you think best.

40:12.577 --> 40:15.979
What I need to do and what I think
best are two different things.

40:17.749 --> 40:22.719
Anna, I... I've been
working for Major Andrí.

40:22.721 --> 40:23.870
I know.

40:23.871 --> 40:25.020
And I don't just mean
cooking and cleaning.

40:25.023 --> 40:27.657
I'm not here for that.

40:27.659 --> 40:29.893
You don't have to tell me
anything you don't want to.

40:33.598 --> 40:35.832
We're just making
conversation, right?

40:40.138 --> 40:43.706
Major Andrí left a woman he
loves back in Philadelphia

40:43.708 --> 40:47.710
so she could introduce him
to a Continental general there.

40:47.712 --> 40:49.646
A general?

40:51.183 --> 40:53.116
You want to take this one?

40:57.956 --> 41:00.623
General Benedict Arnold.

41:04.729 --> 41:06.830
Man:
<i>Wilt thou love her,</i>

41:06.832 --> 41:11.067
honor and keep her
in sickness and in health,

41:11.069 --> 41:14.737
and, forsaking all other,
keep thee only unto her

41:14.739 --> 41:16.806
so long as you both shall live?

41:16.808 --> 41:18.775
I will.

41:18.777 --> 41:22.212
And, Margaret,
will thou take this man

41:22.214 --> 41:25.248
to be thy wedded husband?

41:25.250 --> 41:27.217
<i>Wilt thou obey him,</i>

41:27.219 --> 41:30.753
<i>love, honor, and keep him</i>

41:30.755 --> 41:32.989
<i>in sickness and in health,</i>

41:32.991 --> 41:35.158
<i>and, forsaking all other,</i>

41:35.160 --> 41:38.094
<i>keep thee only unto him</i>

41:38.096 --> 41:40.129
<i>so long as you both shall live?</i>

41:47.906 --> 41:49.839
I will.

42:04.689 --> 42:07.290
<i>( music playing )</i>
