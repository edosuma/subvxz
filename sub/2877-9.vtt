WEBVTT

00:03.128 --> 00:04.211
Hey.

00:04.379 --> 00:05.504
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:05.672 --> 00:07.965
We're here to say goodbye.
We're off to Ohio.

00:08.132 --> 00:10.384
Oh, right, your adoption interview.

00:10.593 --> 00:13.387
Yep. We'll meet the lady
who could be carrying our baby.

00:13.596 --> 00:17.725
I can't believe it. When you come back,
you'll have a baby. That is so weird.

00:17.934 --> 00:19.810
And so incorrect.

00:20.645 --> 00:22.312
She's only a couple months pregnant.

00:22.480 --> 00:24.898
She liked our application,
who knows if she'll like us.

00:25.108 --> 00:27.109
Oh, come on, she's gonna
love you guys.

00:27.277 --> 00:30.029
Oh, thank you. But we're trying
not to get our hopes up.

00:30.196 --> 00:31.822
A lot could still get in our way.

00:31.990 --> 00:34.992
She could decide against adoption,
like another couple better.

00:35.201 --> 00:36.618
What are you gonna name it?

00:37.037 --> 00:40.914
I could develop a condition in which
I talk and talk, and no one hears a word.

00:42.584 --> 00:45.210
But just think, okay?
What if everything goes right?

00:45.378 --> 00:47.588
What if this woman does pick you guys?

00:48.840 --> 00:51.967
Oh, my God. She's gonna pick us!

00:52.177 --> 00:54.762
So we're standing firm on
"not getting our hopes up"?

00:55.555 --> 00:58.432
No. I know things could still
go wrong, but if they don't...

00:58.600 --> 01:01.477
...if this works out,
we're gonna have a baby. A baby!

01:01.686 --> 01:03.645
- Yes. But...
- Oh, my God. It's gonna work!

01:03.813 --> 01:05.313
We're gonna make it work!

01:05.482 --> 01:07.858
I'm gonna be a mommy
and you're gonna be a daddy!

01:08.026 --> 01:10.903
All right, I'll see you suckers.
I'm gonna go get me a baby!

01:15.617 --> 01:17.701
Oh, screw it. I'm gonna be a daddy!

02:02.455 --> 02:03.789
Hey, who's Phoebe with?

02:05.458 --> 02:08.460
I wanna say, "Someone
I'm gonna have sex with."

02:11.464 --> 02:13.298
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:13.466 --> 02:16.635
- So, uh, who's your friend?
- Oh, that's Sarah.

02:17.220 --> 02:18.929
No. Don't you get any ideas.

02:19.097 --> 02:21.557
I'm not setting you up
with any more of my friends.

02:21.766 --> 02:24.101
- Why? Why?
- Because you'll date her once...

02:24.269 --> 02:26.478
...sleep with her, then forget she exists.

02:26.646 --> 02:28.814
Oh! Name one friend of yours
I did that with.

02:29.023 --> 02:31.358
- Mandy.
- Mandy, huh? Uh...

02:31.860 --> 02:34.111
Really hot blond, big boobs?

02:35.363 --> 02:39.158
- No.
- Might be why I don't remember her, huh?

02:40.660 --> 02:42.578
Do you think I'm someone else?

02:47.250 --> 02:50.294
Okay, look, I may not have treated
your friends well in the past.

02:50.461 --> 02:53.422
But I have grown up a lot.
Really. Honest. Rach?

02:53.631 --> 02:55.549
Yeah, believe it or not, it's true.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.634
I mean, when Joey and I were together...

02:57.802 --> 03:02.014
...he was wonderful.
He was thoughtful and mature.

03:02.182 --> 03:05.184
And for the one week
that we went out...

03:05.977 --> 03:07.769
...he didn't sleep with anybody else.

03:07.979 --> 03:10.022
Growth.

03:12.275 --> 03:15.152
- Fine, I'll give you her number.
- Okay. Thank you.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.487
And I promise you
I will not forget this one.

03:17.655 --> 03:18.947
- Mandy.
- Sarah!

03:19.157 --> 03:20.949
Sarah.

03:23.578 --> 03:24.703
- Hey.
- Hi.

03:24.871 --> 03:27.122
- Hey.
- Hey, guys, I need some fashion advice.

03:27.332 --> 03:28.790
Oh. Huh.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.834
How does this look?

03:36.341 --> 03:38.884
Well, it's... It's a little low.
Pick it up a little.

03:40.637 --> 03:43.680
A little bit more.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.265
There you go.

03:47.185 --> 03:48.852
Now throw it away.

03:49.562 --> 03:51.730
Come on! This looks good.

03:51.898 --> 03:55.359
Ross, please trust me.
I buy 30 fashion magazines a month.

03:55.526 --> 03:59.029
Now, I don't know who's running
for president or who that NATO guy is...

03:59.197 --> 04:02.199
...but I do know that you
have to get far away from that hat.

04:02.575 --> 04:03.992
Damn it. God...

04:04.160 --> 04:07.537
I have this date tomorrow night,
and I have to look cool.

04:07.747 --> 04:10.832
If you want fashion help, Rachel and I
are going shopping tomorrow.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.086
- You're welcome to come with us.
- Really? That would be great.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.754
Uh, I mean, I have to do something.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.798
She kind of teased me
about how I dress.

04:17.966 --> 04:20.591
I can see why. Nice shirt. Ha, ha.

04:20.843 --> 04:22.886
You're wearing the same shirt.

04:25.765 --> 04:27.849
Stupid Gap on every corner!

04:36.192 --> 04:38.944
Make yourselves comfortable,
and I'll be back with Erica.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.612
Okay, thank you.

04:41.990 --> 04:44.783
Well, this is it.

04:44.951 --> 04:47.244
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, it's just weird, you know?

04:47.412 --> 04:52.124
It's like, uh, "Hi, I'm Chandler. May I
have the human growing inside you?"

04:52.875 --> 04:53.917
Ooh!

04:54.085 --> 04:57.462
You're gonna be great.

04:57.630 --> 05:00.048
Well, obviously.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.885
Monica? Chandler?
I'd like you to meet Erica.

05:04.053 --> 05:06.763
- Hi.
- Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.

05:06.931 --> 05:08.974
- Hi.
- Thank you for agreeing to see us.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.851
- Hi.
- I'll let you get acquainted.

05:11.019 --> 05:14.062
- Okay.
- So it's Monica and Chandler?

05:14.272 --> 05:18.525
I only know you as
"File CRW33815-D."

05:19.110 --> 05:21.653
That's what our friends call us.

05:22.322 --> 05:26.533
Gosh, you know, you're just
such an amazing couple. It's...

05:26.701 --> 05:28.035
...kind of intimidating.

05:28.244 --> 05:30.120
Oh, ha, ha. I don't know about that.

05:30.288 --> 05:33.248
Are you kidding me?
I mean, it's enough that you're a doctor.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.753
But on top of it,
you're married to a reverend?

05:42.216 --> 05:45.427
- I don't think that's exactly...
- Let her finish, doctor.

05:49.682 --> 05:51.558
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:51.726 --> 05:54.394
Oh, my friend Sarah
had a great time last night.

05:54.562 --> 05:57.105
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so you gonna call this one back?

05:57.315 --> 05:59.107
Ha, ha. No.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.027
What are you talking about?
Sarah's great.

06:02.195 --> 06:05.906
Oh, really? You wanna know
what your "great" friend did?

06:06.282 --> 06:07.783
We were out to dinner, okay?

06:07.950 --> 06:10.410
We were getting along,
having a really nice time.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.537
I was thinking she was really cool.

06:12.705 --> 06:15.207
And then, out of nowhere...

06:38.106 --> 06:39.564
That's it?

06:39.732 --> 06:42.109
That's why you won't
go out with her again?

06:42.276 --> 06:43.944
So she took some fries. Big deal.

06:44.153 --> 06:46.446
Hey, look, it's not about a few fries.

06:46.614 --> 06:48.490
It's about what the fries represent.

06:48.699 --> 06:51.076
- What?
- All food!

06:51.702 --> 06:53.453
Well, I'm sorry.

06:53.621 --> 06:56.832
I can't believe I set you up
with such a monster!

06:56.999 --> 06:59.167
Hey, hey, hey, look, I take a girl out...

06:59.335 --> 07:02.629
...she can order whatever she wants.
The more the better, all right?

07:02.797 --> 07:06.800
Just don't order a garden salad
and then eat my food!

07:07.635 --> 07:09.511
That's a good way to lose some fingers.

07:11.514 --> 07:13.014
Oh, thank God you're here.

07:13.182 --> 07:14.266
- Listen to this.
- What?

07:14.475 --> 07:18.186
Joey and my friend are out last night,
having dinner, and she reaches over...

07:18.354 --> 07:21.189
...and takes a few of his fries...
- Oh, no!

07:21.399 --> 07:23.483
Mm-hm.
- What?

07:24.152 --> 07:26.862
You know about the plate thing?

07:27.071 --> 07:29.573
Oh, yeah, yeah.
No, Joey doesn't share food.

07:29.740 --> 07:32.451
I mean, just last week
we were having breakfast...

07:32.618 --> 07:34.661
...and he had a couple grapes
on his plate.

07:34.871 --> 07:37.372
- You wouldn't let her have a grape?
- Oh, no, not me.

07:37.540 --> 07:38.665
Emma.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.212
Joey doesn't share food!

07:48.634 --> 07:52.012
Well, I still think that is a stupid reason
not to call someone again.

07:52.221 --> 07:54.473
You are calling her, okay?

07:54.682 --> 07:58.226
And if you need to, then just
get an extra plate of fries for the table.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.649
I like that.

08:04.817 --> 08:07.194
A sharing buffer. Yeah.

08:07.361 --> 08:10.822
Yeah, I'll order some extra fries.
Maybe a plate of onion rings.

08:11.199 --> 08:12.699
Yeah. Yeah.

08:12.909 --> 08:15.243
And a shrimp cocktail.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.662
Uh-huh. And some Buffalo wings.

08:17.830 --> 08:20.874
Maybe...
Maybe an individual pizza, huh?

08:21.042 --> 08:23.543
And some mozzarella sticks.

08:24.754 --> 08:26.546
What were we talking about?

08:31.552 --> 08:33.428
Wow, this place is awesome.

08:33.638 --> 08:36.181
We should just go.
I'm not gonna find anything here.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.807
This stuff is ridiculous.

08:37.975 --> 08:40.559
Oh, this place is great!

08:41.187 --> 08:42.270
Wow.

08:42.480 --> 08:45.732
Rach, come on, I'm not gonna wear
any of this. Nothing silver.

08:45.942 --> 08:48.985
- Wha...?
- Okay, nothing with hair.

08:49.153 --> 08:51.863
- And nothing with padlocks on it!
- Aw.

08:52.031 --> 08:55.033
Ross, look. Look, I know that
some of this stuff is out there.

08:55.201 --> 08:58.119
But, I mean, come on, look at this.
Look at this sweater.

08:58.287 --> 08:59.788
I mean, this is just beautiful.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.165
Wow, this is really soft.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.876
Three hundred and fifty dollars?

09:05.086 --> 09:09.381
Down from 700.
You're saving like 200 bucks.

09:11.133 --> 09:15.345
Both logic and math are taking
a serious hit today.

09:16.138 --> 09:19.266
Hey, check this out. It's totally you.

09:19.433 --> 09:20.559
- Wow.
- Yeah.

09:20.726 --> 09:22.227
Huh.

09:24.772 --> 09:27.148
Wow. Actually, this looks pretty good.

09:27.316 --> 09:28.692
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:32.029 --> 09:33.989
"Boys will be boys"?

09:35.116 --> 09:37.325
- What? They will be!
- All right.

09:37.535 --> 09:40.662
- That's it, I'm getting out of here.
- No, Ross, wait, come on.

09:40.871 --> 09:44.332
There's other stuff here. There's some
nice shirts, these nice pants.

09:44.500 --> 09:47.252
Huh. Actually, these might look
pretty good on me.

09:47.420 --> 09:50.297
Yes, they will. You know what you
should do? Go take a walk.

09:50.464 --> 09:54.134
I know your size, and I'm gonna pick out
some really good stuff for you.

09:54.302 --> 09:55.719
- Really?
- Yes.

09:55.886 --> 09:57.387
I know what looks sexy on guys.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.682
Just wear what I suggest,
and she is gonna go nuts for you.

10:00.891 --> 10:02.267
So you're saying, uh...

10:02.435 --> 10:06.605
...if I wear these pants,
I might be getting into hers?

10:07.857 --> 10:09.983
Why do men keep talking to me like this?

10:12.903 --> 10:16.239
So the fact that I'm a doctor
and my wife's a reverend...

10:16.407 --> 10:17.866
...that's important to you?

10:18.034 --> 10:19.951
Yeah. I read some great applications...

10:20.119 --> 10:23.204
...but I thought, "Who better
than a minister to raise a child?"

10:23.372 --> 10:24.956
Amen.

10:26.792 --> 10:29.794
Plus, I thought the baby would be
in good hands with a doctor.

10:29.962 --> 10:32.047
Oh, good hands.

10:32.214 --> 10:34.299
Healing hands.

10:35.468 --> 10:38.803
Reverend, can I ask? Does the Bible
say anything about adoption?

10:38.971 --> 10:40.972
It says, "Do it."

10:42.850 --> 10:48.438
"And behold, she did adopt
unto them a baby.

10:49.398 --> 10:51.941
And it was good."

10:53.277 --> 10:56.571
- Wow.
- Yeah, wow.

10:57.156 --> 10:59.574
I was wondering...
You both have such serious jobs.

10:59.742 --> 11:02.869
Would you have time to take care
of a baby and your flock?

11:03.037 --> 11:05.246
Oh, no, my flock? My flock is good.

11:05.414 --> 11:08.708
Yeah. My flock pretty much
takes care of themselves by this point.

11:08.876 --> 11:10.877
It's a good flock. Flock, flock, flock.

11:13.297 --> 11:15.924
But being a doctor,
that must take up a lot of time.

11:16.133 --> 11:18.885
Not for me it doesn't.

11:19.053 --> 11:21.137
So how's everything going in here?

11:21.305 --> 11:23.932
We're great. I think
I may have asked all my questions.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.975
Good. Do you have questions for Erica?

11:26.143 --> 11:29.896
Yeah, actually.
So you read a file that you liked...

11:30.064 --> 11:33.650
...and then you gave the agency
the serial number and they contacted us?

11:33.859 --> 11:36.152
Oh, yes. Our system ensures
total anonymity.

11:36.320 --> 11:39.364
- We're very proud of it.
- You should be.

11:39.990 --> 11:42.909
You're really on top of stuff.

11:43.077 --> 11:46.746
Well, then if there's nothing else,
then the two of us should talk.

11:46.914 --> 11:48.456
I actually...

11:48.624 --> 11:50.917
- I don't think we have to.
- We don't?

11:51.085 --> 11:54.337
Yeah, when I read about you two,
I was pretty sure I wanted you...

11:54.505 --> 11:57.132
...but I just thought we should meet
face to face.

11:57.341 --> 11:59.509
I've made my decision.

11:59.802 --> 12:01.553
I choose them. Heh.

12:02.346 --> 12:04.347
Oh, my God, this is great.

12:04.515 --> 12:06.391
This is so great. Did you hear that?

12:06.559 --> 12:07.851
Yeah, I did.

12:08.060 --> 12:09.561
Okay.

12:09.770 --> 12:13.273
- Thank you. Thank you so much. Oh.
- Ha, ha.

12:14.191 --> 12:16.776
Oh. You are so going to heaven!

12:22.908 --> 12:26.619
- Oh, we got some really great stuff.
- Yeah.

12:26.787 --> 12:29.289
Yeah, but I'm not sure about some
of the bras I got.

12:29.457 --> 12:32.083
Oh, really? Do you wanna try
some of them on for me?

12:32.251 --> 12:33.585
Oh, okay.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.463
Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?

12:38.591 --> 12:42.051
Oh, no. I took one of Ross' bags
by mistake.

12:42.219 --> 12:44.137
And one of mine is missing.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.681
Ross probably has it.
You'll get it from him later.

12:52.521 --> 12:55.732
So, what do you think?

12:57.902 --> 13:01.196
I think we're not wearing
the same shirt anymore.

13:02.156 --> 13:04.407
Yeah. Yeah, Rachel picked it out for me.

13:04.575 --> 13:07.452
She told me to trust her,
and you know what? I'm glad I did.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.246
I turned quite a few heads
on my way over here.

13:12.500 --> 13:15.418
Dude, I really don't think
you should be wearing that.

13:16.003 --> 13:17.504
Oh, I see.

13:17.671 --> 13:21.925
Somebody's afraid of a little competition
with the ladies?

13:22.092 --> 13:25.512
Looks like someone is the ladies!

13:26.138 --> 13:29.098
You're just jealous
because you couldn't pull this off.

13:29.308 --> 13:33.102
Yeah. Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a date.

13:34.939 --> 13:39.484
See? All eyes on me!

13:44.156 --> 13:47.242
- We are not signing those papers.
- Why not?

13:47.409 --> 13:51.079
It's wrong. They made a mistake.
They think we're somebody else.

13:51.288 --> 13:53.790
God works in mysterious ways.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.709
You have gotta stop.

13:57.253 --> 13:58.795
But she liked us.

13:59.004 --> 14:01.798
She likes Doctor Chandler
and Reverend Monica.

14:02.466 --> 14:06.052
If you think about it,
I'm kind of like a reverend.

14:06.220 --> 14:12.600
I mean, as a chef, I serve God
by feeding the hungry and poor.

14:13.185 --> 14:16.271
Your veal chop is 34.95.

14:17.481 --> 14:20.316
Come on, I just...
I think we've been given an opportunity.

14:20.484 --> 14:23.486
The mistake's already made.
They're writing up the papers now.

14:23.654 --> 14:25.572
But we're not the ones she chose.

14:25.739 --> 14:27.824
How can you feel okay about this?

14:29.451 --> 14:31.327
Because.

14:31.495 --> 14:34.789
We may not be who she thinks we are...

14:34.957 --> 14:37.709
...but no one will ever
love that baby more than us.

14:37.918 --> 14:39.377
- I know.
- I mean, who knows...

14:39.545 --> 14:42.630
...how long it's gonna take
for someone else to give us a baby?

14:42.798 --> 14:45.633
What if no one ever picks us?

14:45.801 --> 14:47.218
Oh, honey...

14:47.386 --> 14:48.970
Please?

14:49.138 --> 14:51.639
Please. We are so close.

14:53.517 --> 14:55.894
Monica, I want a baby too.

14:56.061 --> 14:58.354
But this woman is giving away her child.

14:58.522 --> 15:01.399
She deserves to know who it's going to.

15:08.657 --> 15:10.783
Okay. You're right.

15:12.703 --> 15:15.121
So we'll tell the truth.

15:15.289 --> 15:18.791
And who knows, you know?
Maybe she'll like us for us.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.296
Maybe she will.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.049
Oh, why couldn't I
have been a reverend?

15:26.216 --> 15:28.468
You're Jewish.

15:29.887 --> 15:32.096
Technicality!

15:37.394 --> 15:39.145
Garden salad for the lady.

15:39.313 --> 15:42.607
- Oh, that looks great. Good ordering.
Ha-ha-ha.

15:42.775 --> 15:46.653
Seafood platter for the gentleman,
and extra fries.

15:46.820 --> 15:48.529
- Enjoy.
- Ha, ha.

15:50.115 --> 15:52.492
Mm. Those fries look delicious.

15:52.701 --> 15:55.161
- Oh, I didn't know you liked french fries.
- Ha, ha.

15:55.329 --> 15:57.205
Help yourself. What's mine is yours.

16:01.543 --> 16:04.379
Oh. Wow, are those stuffed clams?

16:07.883 --> 16:08.967
Uh...

16:09.134 --> 16:11.469
Yes, they are my stuffed clams.

16:13.931 --> 16:15.598
How about those fries, though, huh?

16:17.810 --> 16:20.687
- They are delicious. Ha-ha-ha.
- Yeah.

16:23.524 --> 16:27.026
You are beautiful, you know that?

16:28.237 --> 16:30.113
That is so sweet.

16:31.824 --> 16:34.117
Okay, then.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.703
Mm.

16:40.124 --> 16:41.791
Mm-hm.

16:45.546 --> 16:47.213
Now look what you did!

16:47.381 --> 16:50.049
What? What is the matter with you?

16:50.259 --> 16:53.594
I don't like it when people
take food off of my plate, okay?

16:53.804 --> 16:55.763
But you said, "What's mine is yours."

16:55.973 --> 16:57.640
Well, I didn't mean it!

16:58.976 --> 17:03.354
Fine. Sorry, I didn't think
it was that big a deal.

17:04.940 --> 17:06.898
No, I'm sorry. I...

17:07.067 --> 17:11.529
I'm overreacting, okay?
It's just, when it comes to food, I...

17:11.696 --> 17:13.239
...have certain rules...

17:13.449 --> 17:15.199
...okay? I mean...

17:15.409 --> 17:20.371
...there are things you do, and,
you know, things that you don't do.

17:27.337 --> 17:28.796
Wow, this place looks great.

17:28.964 --> 17:33.634
Oh, you are gonna love it.
And I'm so glad we're finally doing this.

17:33.802 --> 17:36.846
- Me too.
- Here.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.690
So this was fun.

17:55.741 --> 17:58.701
I really am sorry about,
you know, before.

17:58.869 --> 18:01.496
And I wanna make sure you know
I really do like you.

18:01.705 --> 18:04.457
Sure, just not as much as clams.

18:04.666 --> 18:06.417
Well, stuffed clams, ha, ha...

18:08.420 --> 18:10.338
- Chocolate torte for the lady.
- Mm.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.632
Cheesecake for the gentleman.

18:12.841 --> 18:17.595
Uh, excuse me, sir. There seems to be
some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.

18:18.180 --> 18:21.140
Oh. Yes, that's a raspberry coulis.

18:21.350 --> 18:24.852
I'm so stupid ordering cheesecake,
trying to be healthy.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.564
Oh, my God. Mm.

18:28.774 --> 18:31.275
- I'll just have what she's having.
- I'm sorry, sir.

18:31.443 --> 18:33.319
- That was our last piece.
- Mm.

18:34.404 --> 18:36.239
Mm. Mm.

18:37.741 --> 18:39.784
Oh, no.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.745
This is work. I should call in.
Can you excuse me?

18:42.913 --> 18:45.123
Oh, yeah, sure. No problem.

18:47.459 --> 18:50.628
What are you doing?
I thought you don't share food?

18:50.796 --> 18:52.255
Sure I do.

18:52.464 --> 18:54.132
- Coulis?
- Ha, ha.

18:54.633 --> 18:58.636
No. If I can't have your clams,
you can't have my dessert.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.263
This is a two-way street.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.684
Really?

19:05.477 --> 19:06.519
Really.

19:06.687 --> 19:09.730
Now this all better be here
when I come back.

19:09.898 --> 19:14.944
Yeah, of course. I can control myself.
Ha-ha-ha. Yeah.

19:25.956 --> 19:28.332
Stop staring at me!

19:39.094 --> 19:42.138
Just a tiny little... Ha, ha.

19:44.641 --> 19:46.642
Uh-oh.

19:56.111 --> 19:58.654
I'm not even sorry.

20:02.576 --> 20:04.744
- Hi.
- Hey.

20:04.912 --> 20:08.831
So these are the preliminary forms
for an open adoption. Uh...

20:09.041 --> 20:11.918
There's a lot to go over,
but I'll explain as we go through.

20:12.753 --> 20:16.172
- Is that a picture?
- Yeah.

20:16.381 --> 20:18.841
It's a sonogram they took
of the baby last week.

20:19.009 --> 20:20.676
I thought you might wanna see it.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.228
Look, doctor.

20:34.274 --> 20:37.526
Look, before we sign anything,
we really have to talk.

20:41.031 --> 20:42.907
We're not who you think we are.

20:43.075 --> 20:46.202
- I don't understand.
- The agency must have made a mistake.

20:46.370 --> 20:49.288
My wife is not a reverend,
and I'm not a doctor.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.374
- What?
- That's impossible.

20:51.583 --> 20:54.919
I could perform an operation on you
and prove it if you'd like.

20:56.672 --> 20:59.840
Um, I have to check your file. Excuse me.

21:00.008 --> 21:01.300
So who are you?

21:01.510 --> 21:04.595
Our names really are Monica and
Chandler. We're from New York.

21:04.763 --> 21:07.181
Yeah, but the important thing
to know about us...

21:07.349 --> 21:10.518
...is how much we would care
for this little baby.

21:10.727 --> 21:12.728
So you lied to me before?

21:12.896 --> 21:16.482
Well, we "bore false witness."

21:17.901 --> 21:20.403
See? I could be a reverend.

21:21.405 --> 21:22.989
I can't believe this.

21:23.156 --> 21:25.741
But we were hoping that
since we told you the truth...

21:25.909 --> 21:28.953
...that you still might consider...
- Giving you my baby?

21:29.121 --> 21:31.247
You think I'd give you my child
after this?

21:31.456 --> 21:34.083
You don't have to decide now.
If you look at our file...

21:34.251 --> 21:37.336
I don't wanna look at your file.
This is over.

21:41.758 --> 21:43.509
Erica, wait.

21:43.677 --> 21:45.636
I have nothing to say to you.

21:45.804 --> 21:49.557
Look, you have every reason to be upset.
We did lie.

21:49.766 --> 21:53.811
But only because we've been waiting
and trying to have a baby for so long.

21:53.979 --> 21:57.440
And we don't know how long it's gonna be
before we get another chance.

21:57.649 --> 21:59.817
Why don't you ask the reverend
to pray on it?

21:59.985 --> 22:02.486
Erica, please.

22:03.071 --> 22:07.199
Just consider us.
Ask them to see our file.

22:07.367 --> 22:09.327
Our last name's Bing.

22:09.494 --> 22:12.079
My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.

22:13.165 --> 22:14.999
Oh, yeah.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.710
I actually liked you guys.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.464
But it doesn't matter.
What you did was wrong.

22:21.631 --> 22:24.258
But you did like us.

22:24.426 --> 22:26.260
And you should.

22:26.762 --> 22:29.013
My wife's an incredible woman.

22:29.181 --> 22:33.225
She is loving, and devoted and caring.

22:33.643 --> 22:37.563
And don't tell her I said this,
but the woman's always right.

22:41.276 --> 22:44.779
I love my wife more than anything
in this world.

22:46.073 --> 22:47.656
And it...

22:48.784 --> 22:52.244
It kills me that I can't give her a baby.

22:57.626 --> 23:00.002
I really want a kid.

23:01.088 --> 23:04.799
And when that day finally comes,
I'll learn how to be a good dad.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.301
But my wife...

23:07.636 --> 23:09.762
...she's already there.

23:10.097 --> 23:12.098
She's a mother...

23:13.183 --> 23:15.226
...without a baby.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.193
Please?

23:36.039 --> 23:38.165
You still want that baby?

23:53.807 --> 23:56.016
God bless you, Chandler Bing!

24:09.906 --> 24:12.533
Turns out this sweater
is made for a woman.

24:14.911 --> 24:16.912
So why are you still wearing it?

24:17.122 --> 24:18.664
Because it's soft.

24:20.709 --> 24:22.251
- Hey, so how was your date?
- Ugh.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.253
Not so good.

24:26.047 --> 24:30.593
Well, looks like it's just
the two of us tonight, huh, buddy?

24:30.760 --> 24:33.804
Yeah. And you know what?
We could do a lot worse.

24:33.972 --> 24:36.891
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Ha-ha-ha.

24:38.185 --> 24:41.187
Joey doesn't share food!
