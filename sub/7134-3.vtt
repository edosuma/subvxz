28:14.042 --> 28:17.291
- Said!

28:17.291 --> 28:19.166
- Yo!

28:19.166 --> 28:21.084
- You are disturbing
our morning prayer.

28:21.084 --> 28:22.625
- Yeah well,
you got mail.

28:22.625 --> 28:24.126
Sign here.

28:24.126 --> 28:26.209
- I will sign
for it later.

28:26.209 --> 28:27.625
- Look, I haven't
got time for this.

28:27.625 --> 28:29.126
Schillinger's
still in the hole.

28:29.126 --> 28:30.542
So we're short staffed
in the mail room.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.125
I gotta get back.

28:32.125 --> 28:36.000
- Now this I will
gladly sign for.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.083
- Yeah?

28:38.083 --> 28:40.959
Well, I'm fucking thrilled.

28:51.126 --> 28:53.041
- My brothers.

28:53.041 --> 28:54.625
Your book about the riot.

28:54.625 --> 29:01.166
This is proof that the truth
cannot be silenced.

29:10.333 --> 29:13.667
- The annotated code.

29:13.667 --> 29:15.834
You giving up god
for the law?

29:15.834 --> 29:18.166
- God's laws
are clear to me.

29:18.166 --> 29:21.166
It's those of man
that are not.

29:21.166 --> 29:23.208
I've been studying
legal books

29:23.208 --> 29:25.042
for the last eight months,

29:25.042 --> 29:27.917
trying to see if god's laws
and those of the white man

29:27.917 --> 29:31.709
have anything in common.

29:31.709 --> 29:34.208
- What have you
discovered?

29:34.208 --> 29:38.001
- That these are nothing
but words on a page.

29:38.001 --> 29:41.583
The annotated code exists
solely to be circumvented.

29:41.583 --> 29:44.959
- Without law,
we have anarchy.

29:44.959 --> 29:48.291
- You should read your
morning paper, old man.

29:48.291 --> 29:51.209
We have
anarchy anyway.

29:51.209 --> 29:53.291
- I would have thought
after the riot

29:53.291 --> 29:54.542
you would have learned.

29:54.542 --> 29:57.167
You can't overthrow
the system.

29:57.167 --> 30:00.209
- Oh, I learned,

30:00.209 --> 30:02.333
and I have no interest
in seeing more men die.

30:02.333 --> 30:06.417
No, I intend to
use the tools

30:06.417 --> 30:08.000
that were used against me.

30:08.000 --> 30:14.959
I intend to make
the law devour itself.

30:14.959 --> 30:16.208
- Judge Richard Kibler
was sentenced today

30:16.208 --> 30:18.083
to 16 months in prison.

30:18.083 --> 30:21.000
The 12-year veteran
of the state criminal court

30:21.000 --> 30:22.625
was convicted
of taking bribes

30:22.625 --> 30:24.667
in exchange for leniency
in three murder cases

30:24.667 --> 30:25.750
he presided over in 1995.

30:25.750 --> 30:27.208
- You hear this?

30:27.208 --> 30:28.875
Cocksucker Kibler
was the judge

30:28.875 --> 30:30.166
at my fucking trial.

30:30.166 --> 30:33.125
- For real?
- Shit, yeah.

30:33.125 --> 30:35.041
If I'd have known the
motherfucker was up for bribes,

30:35.041 --> 30:37.042
I'd have put my
two dollars down.

30:37.042 --> 30:38.583
Shit ain't fair.

30:38.583 --> 30:41.001
- You're right,
it's not.

30:41.001 --> 30:42.875
You know what you
ought to do, Hill?

30:42.875 --> 30:45.583
- What?
- Talk to Said.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.500
- Now it says here
in this article

30:48.500 --> 30:51.208
that Kibler took
bribes in November.

30:51.208 --> 30:54.291
You weren't approached
by him or anyone else

30:54.291 --> 30:56.125
about taking bribes?

30:56.125 --> 30:58.084
- Nobody said dick to me.

30:58.084 --> 31:02.000
- Did he talk to
your lawyer?

31:02.000 --> 31:05.834
- If they did, he never
said word one to me.

31:05.834 --> 31:09.001
- Good, that's good,

31:09.001 --> 31:11.667
I think we have a case.

31:11.667 --> 31:14.750
- A case?
- Yeah.

31:14.750 --> 31:17.041
You were denied your right
to a fair trial

31:17.041 --> 31:18.959
by an impartial judge.

31:18.959 --> 31:23.709
- So you're saying that
we could go to court

31:23.709 --> 31:25.041
and have the verdict
overturned?

31:25.041 --> 31:28.875
- My friend,

31:28.875 --> 31:32.000
you have a real shot

31:32.000 --> 31:33.875
at going free.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.583
- Now let me get
this straight--

31:41.583 --> 31:44.291
Judge Kibler did not take
a bribe in Hill's case?

31:44.291 --> 31:45.792
- That is correct.

31:45.792 --> 31:47.417
- Ad he didn't ask for
a bribe either?

31:47.417 --> 31:48.792
- This is also correct.

31:48.792 --> 31:50.375
- Then what exactly are
we talking about?

31:50.375 --> 31:54.084
- The judge was lenient with
those who did give bribes,

31:54.084 --> 31:56.125
so he may have been harsher
with those who did not.

31:56.125 --> 31:58.291
Look, all we ask is
for the opportunity

31:58.291 --> 32:00.041
to explore the merits
of the case.

32:00.041 --> 32:02.834
- What opportunities
are we talking about?

32:02.834 --> 32:04.250
- And for how long?

32:04.250 --> 32:08.500
- Look, we're gonna need
more time for visitations.

32:08.500 --> 32:10.042
I'm gonna need to
talk to the lawyer

32:10.042 --> 32:12.167
who originally represented
Augustus and anybody

32:12.167 --> 32:14.042
that offered bribes,
their lawyers,

32:14.042 --> 32:18.083
the prosecution at Judge
Kibler's trial, et cetera.

32:18.083 --> 32:22.209
- You've stayed pretty
quiet through all this.

32:22.209 --> 32:23.542
- Kareem said he'd
be doing the talking.

32:23.542 --> 32:25.875
I'd be an idiot not to keep
my fucking mouth shut.

32:30.209 --> 32:32.750
You lying.
- I ain't.

32:32.750 --> 32:34.458
- Clifford, I sat next to you
through all those hearings,

32:34.458 --> 32:36.166
all those days
of the trial.

32:36.166 --> 32:38.209
I got so I could tell
when you was lying.

32:38.209 --> 32:39.291
You get that
little twitch.

32:39.291 --> 32:40.834
- I do?

32:40.834 --> 32:43.041
- That's probably why
you're such a shit lawyer.

32:43.041 --> 32:44.333
- Augustus, please.

32:44.333 --> 32:46.250
Insults do us
no good at all.

32:46.250 --> 32:48.084
- Sure as hell make
me feel better.

32:48.084 --> 32:49.834
- Look, I did the best
I could for you.

32:49.834 --> 32:50.959
- Yeah, I know.

32:50.959 --> 32:52.542
That's why I'm saying,
you shit.

32:52.542 --> 32:54.750
- Can we get back to
the point, please?

32:56.917 --> 33:01.917
Now you knew others
were giving bribes.

33:01.917 --> 33:04.583
- I heard stuff in
the courthouse hallways,

33:04.583 --> 33:06.042
that's all.

33:06.042 --> 33:07.125
- Then why didn't you jump,
you motherfucker?

33:07.125 --> 33:08.375
- Call me naive.

33:08.375 --> 33:09.834
I thought I'd get
a "not guilty"

33:09.834 --> 33:11.333
based on the strength
of the case.

33:11.333 --> 33:13.001
- If you knew
what was going on,

33:13.001 --> 33:15.126
why did you not go to
the state judicial commission?

33:15.126 --> 33:16.834
- Come on, I go
to the state commission?

33:16.834 --> 33:19.041
And nothing happens,
except the next time,

33:19.041 --> 33:20.417
I'm pleading a case
in front of Kibler,

33:20.417 --> 33:23.417
he cuts off my balls.

33:24.417 --> 33:29.208
- Well?
- Marilyn Crenshaw,

33:29.208 --> 33:32.083
the assistant district attorney
who prosecuted Kibler,

33:32.083 --> 33:34.375
she will meet
with us tomorrow.

33:34.375 --> 33:36.083
- Oh, cool!

33:36.083 --> 33:37.667
- Unfortunately though,

33:37.667 --> 33:39.834
the lawyers who gave bribes
won't take my calls.

33:39.834 --> 33:42.001
The secretaries say,
"I'll get back to you".

33:42.001 --> 33:44.208
I say, "You can't
get back to me."

33:44.208 --> 33:45.542
- You know what
we should do?

33:45.542 --> 33:46.834
We should
check and see

33:46.834 --> 33:48.000
if any of those
three murderers

33:48.000 --> 33:49.417
are doing their time in Oz.

33:49.417 --> 33:50.834
- I did;
they're not.

33:50.834 --> 33:52.250
They're in
different prisons.

33:52.250 --> 33:53.625
- So what
do we do?

33:53.625 --> 33:55.126
- Well, I'm gonna
write to each one,

33:55.126 --> 33:56.709
but I don't expect
any response.

33:56.709 --> 33:57.875
- So we're fucked?

33:57.875 --> 33:59.250
- No, no, no.

33:59.250 --> 34:03.167
Good things don't
come easy, my brother.

34:03.167 --> 34:04.792
- Yeah.

34:04.792 --> 34:06.709
[buzzer sounds]
- Count!

34:06.709 --> 34:09.542
- Until tomorrow.

34:09.542 --> 34:12.209
As-salaam alaikum,
brother.

34:13.667 --> 34:15.375
- Straight line.
You know how we do this.

34:19.167 --> 34:21.750
[tense percussive tones]

34:25.417 --> 34:27.250
- When you were
gathering evidence

34:27.250 --> 34:29.000
to prosecute Judge Kibler,

34:29.000 --> 34:32.792
did you ever hear Augustus
Hill's name mentioned?

34:32.792 --> 34:34.458
- No.

34:34.458 --> 34:35.834
- In reference to the
three murder convictions

34:35.834 --> 34:37.166
that Kibler was lenient with,

34:37.166 --> 34:40.542
did you perceive any
sort of pattern?

34:40.542 --> 34:42.042
- No.

34:42.042 --> 34:44.291
- So nothing about these
three men was consistent?

34:44.291 --> 34:45.959
They share the same
style of murder,

34:45.959 --> 34:49.000
same lawyer,
same skin tone?

34:49.000 --> 34:51.041
- Sorry, you're not
gonna be able to

34:51.041 --> 34:52.333
turn this into
something racial.

34:52.333 --> 34:53.875
- That is not
my intention.

34:53.875 --> 34:55.125
- Bullshit!

34:55.125 --> 34:57.001
The only two elements
that are similar

34:57.001 --> 34:58.208
in these three murders
is they were men

34:58.208 --> 34:59.709
and they were guilty.

34:59.709 --> 35:01.001
- Oh, so you're saying
the bribes were random?

35:01.001 --> 35:02.125
- Yes.

35:02.125 --> 35:03.625
- And would you testify
to that in court?

35:03.625 --> 35:05.000
- I never said that
I would testify in court,

35:05.000 --> 35:06.917
and if you try to compel me,
I'll take you to court.

35:06.917 --> 35:08.792
- Now why would
you do that?

35:08.792 --> 35:10.583
You're an assistant
district attorney,

35:10.583 --> 35:12.709
sworn to seeing
justice done.

35:12.709 --> 35:14.333
Now doesn't your definition
of justice extend

35:14.333 --> 35:15.875
to my client?

35:15.875 --> 35:17.709
- Your client?
Please.

35:17.709 --> 35:19.208
The only place that
you are a lawyer

35:19.208 --> 35:21.084
is in your own head.

35:21.084 --> 35:23.333
I see what you're doing,
strutting around,

35:23.333 --> 35:25.500
thumbing your nose
at the system,

35:25.500 --> 35:29.125
thumbing your nose at everything
that I believe in.

35:29.125 --> 35:33.542
It's not him that
I won't help; it's you.

35:33.542 --> 35:35.333
Look, you could
win this case.

35:35.333 --> 35:37.083
Let me give you
some free legal advice,

35:37.083 --> 35:39.959
get yourself a lawyer,
a real  fucking lawyer.

35:48.250 --> 35:50.750
- You know
that woman?

35:50.750 --> 35:52.167
- Why do you ask?

35:52.167 --> 35:55.042
- You two seemed
awful familiar.

35:55.042 --> 35:57.041
That's not the bitch that
prosecuted you, is she?

35:57.041 --> 35:59.834
- Marilyn and I,

35:59.834 --> 36:06.375
before I found Allah,

36:06.375 --> 36:09.167
we were engaged
to be married.

36:12.792 --> 36:14.166
[knocking]

36:14.166 --> 36:16.208
I need more
access to phones.

36:16.208 --> 36:17.458
I need to be able
to get calls

36:17.458 --> 36:19.000
as well as make them.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.167
- Well, why don't we just run
a switchboard into your pod?

36:22.167 --> 36:25.750
- Oh, answer a legitimate
request with sarcasm.

36:25.750 --> 36:28.500
- Legitimate request?
- Yes.

36:28.500 --> 36:31.126
- Said, you're an inmate
in a maximum-security prison.

36:31.126 --> 36:32.583
Now if I say yes to you,

36:32.583 --> 36:34.709
what's to stop next guy from
asking for the same thing?

36:34.709 --> 36:35.917
- These are special
circumstances.

36:35.917 --> 36:37.250
- No, they're not.

36:37.250 --> 36:39.000
I hate to break
the news to you, pal,

36:39.000 --> 36:41.291
but in here,
you're nobody special.

36:41.291 --> 36:43.792
You deserve no more
than the next man.

36:43.792 --> 36:47.125
- What is
this about?

36:47.125 --> 36:49.250
Is this because you don't
like what I said

36:49.250 --> 36:50.959
about you
in my book?

36:50.959 --> 36:54.542
- No, this is about the fact
that you always ask for help

36:54.542 --> 36:57.208
and you're never willing to
do anything for me in return.

36:57.208 --> 37:00.209
- Why does there have to be
a trade, a negotiation?

37:00.209 --> 37:02.375
I thought that doing
what's right

37:02.375 --> 37:03.792
would be enough for you.

37:07.167 --> 37:08.792
[tense music]

37:08.792 --> 37:11.208
[indistinct chatter]

37:17.166 --> 37:22.001
- No go, huh?

37:22.001 --> 37:24.209
Oh, damn.

37:27.083 --> 37:29.209
Yo, what was that
you were saying about

37:29.209 --> 37:31.001
nothing good
coming easy?

37:31.001 --> 37:34.417
[sighs] Life in prison
is some tough shit

37:34.417 --> 37:36.166
to wrap your
mind around.

37:36.166 --> 37:38.001
But see, I did.

37:38.001 --> 37:40.042
Like everybody else
in this come hole,

37:40.042 --> 37:42.750
I settled in,
I settled down.

37:42.750 --> 37:48.209
But then when you said
the word "free" to me...

37:49.000 --> 37:50.041
I...

37:52.084 --> 37:56.500
Yo, something inside of me
stirred, you know?

37:56.500 --> 38:00.792
Freedom,
I want my freedom.

38:02.959 --> 38:05.209
- And you shall have it,
my brother.

38:05.209 --> 38:08.542
I swear to you
by almighty god,

38:08.542 --> 38:11.750
and everything
that I hold holy,

38:11.750 --> 38:13.917
you will go free.

38:23.208 --> 38:25.209
- Those files are
confidential.

38:25.209 --> 38:27.375
- Yeah, well, I had this
natural curiosity

38:27.375 --> 38:29.917
about my
fellow man.

38:32.458 --> 38:36.542
- We got the results back
