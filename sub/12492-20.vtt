00:08.990 --> 00:12.020
Great news, you guys...
my friend's grandma died.

00:12.060 --> 00:14.460
That's nice, P.J.

00:14.490 --> 00:16.230
You didn't hear what he said, did you, dad?

00:16.260 --> 00:18.060
That's nice, Gabe.

00:18.090 --> 00:21.130
P.J., how is it good news
that an old lady died?

00:21.160 --> 00:24.030
It's good news because
now I can buy her car.

00:24.070 --> 00:26.100
And they're only asking $1000,

00:26.140 --> 00:28.770
Which dad will help me out with.

00:28.810 --> 00:31.610
No, I won't.

00:31.640 --> 00:34.040
Amazing. How do you only
hear what you want to hear?

00:34.080 --> 00:36.910
Hey, I've been married to
your mother for 20 years.

00:36.950 --> 00:40.220
It's called survival.

00:40.250 --> 00:43.020
Come on, dad, I've saved up $700.

00:43.050 --> 00:45.850
All yohave to do is give me...

00:45.890 --> 00:47.860
The rest.

00:47.890 --> 00:50.530
No no.
I'm your dad.

00:50.560 --> 00:53.000
I'm not Santa claus and I'm not a bank.

00:53.030 --> 00:55.030
Well, you're built like both of them.

00:55.060 --> 00:58.500
Dad, please please.

00:58.530 --> 01:00.440
I really need my own car.

01:00.470 --> 01:02.440
Driving girls around in the bug truck.

01:02.470 --> 01:04.410
Just isn't working.

01:04.440 --> 01:07.980
Yeah, that's what's not
working... the bug truck.

01:08.010 --> 01:11.610
Look, P.J., I'm sorry, but I'm
not gonna give you the money.

01:11.650 --> 01:13.420
So I guess you're out of luck on this one.

01:13.450 --> 01:14.850
Way to go, dad.

01:14.880 --> 01:16.850
You just took an old lady's death.

01:16.890 --> 01:19.320
And turned it into something sad.

01:24.830 --> 01:26.330

02:16.980 --> 02:19.250
Okay, Charlie.
These are tools.

02:19.280 --> 02:22.380
This is a screwdriver.
And this is a hammer.

02:22.420 --> 02:24.220
And if you play your cards right,

02:24.250 --> 02:26.220
You'll never have to use either of them.

02:32.660 --> 02:35.830
- Hi. - Hi.
I brought you something from work.

02:35.870 --> 02:38.130
- It's grape to see you.
- It's great to see you too.

02:38.170 --> 02:40.770
Oh no, "grape to see you"
is the name of the smoothie.

02:40.800 --> 02:43.010
Wow, that is lame.

02:43.040 --> 02:44.640
I came up with it.

02:44.670 --> 02:46.340
And delicious.

02:46.380 --> 02:48.340
Hey, Charlie.

02:48.380 --> 02:51.310
Oh, so my mom's gonna be home from work.

02:51.350 --> 02:53.680
In, like, half an hour,
and then we can start studying.

02:53.720 --> 02:56.650
Oh, we were gonna study?
I didn't bring my books.

02:56.690 --> 02:58.520
Perfect.

02:58.550 --> 03:02.020
What're you doing?
Playing with tools, huh?

03:02.060 --> 03:03.860
Ow.

03:03.890 --> 03:07.100
Charlie, what are you doing?
That's Spencer, not Gabe.

03:07.130 --> 03:09.230
Ouch, she really got me.

03:09.270 --> 03:11.700
Oh, I'm so sorry.
That's not like her.

03:11.730 --> 03:13.600
It's okay.
She didn't mean it.

03:13.640 --> 03:15.270
Right, Charlie?

03:15.300 --> 03:16.610
Who's your buddy?
Who's your buddy?

03:16.640 --> 03:19.040
Ow! She bit me.

03:19.080 --> 03:20.210
Charlie.

03:20.240 --> 03:22.410
Man, this really hurts.

03:22.450 --> 03:23.850
I'm so sorry.

03:23.880 --> 03:26.210
Maybe she thought you were yummy.

03:26.250 --> 03:28.450
Maybe you guys should feed her.

03:28.480 --> 03:30.890
We do feed her.
I mean, I don't,

03:30.920 --> 03:33.720
But I assume somebody does.

03:33.760 --> 03:35.520
I'd better go get this looked at.

03:35.560 --> 03:38.060
I'm so sorry.

03:38.090 --> 03:41.030
Oh, maybe we could
not study some other time.

03:41.060 --> 03:43.070
I'll call you.

03:43.100 --> 03:45.570
Okay.

03:49.970 --> 03:52.570
Charlie, you chased my boyfriend away.

03:52.610 --> 03:53.880
Are you happy now?

04:01.520 --> 04:03.790
- What are you doing?
- Looking for loose change.

04:03.820 --> 04:07.020
Gotta scrounge up 300 bucks somehow.

04:07.060 --> 04:08.460
How much do you have so far?

04:08.490 --> 04:10.460
A Penny.

04:10.490 --> 04:13.800
A checker.

04:13.830 --> 04:15.860
Possibly a grape?

04:17.329 --> 04:19.529
No.

04:21.240 --> 04:23.810
What if I said

04:23.840 --> 04:27.010
I could take care of your little problem?

04:27.040 --> 04:31.050
You can get this taste out of my mouth?

04:31.080 --> 04:34.320
No, I'm talking about the 300 bucks.

04:34.350 --> 04:35.820
How do you have $300?

04:35.850 --> 04:38.550
Simple... every day I have
mom make me lunch.

04:38.590 --> 04:41.520
And ask dad for lunch money.

04:41.560 --> 04:42.990
It adds up quick.

04:43.030 --> 04:45.090
So you'll give me the money?

04:45.130 --> 04:46.530
I will loan you the money.

04:46.560 --> 04:48.600
Oh, you know I'm good for it.

04:48.630 --> 04:52.000
Hey, you know where I live, right?

04:52.030 --> 04:55.400
Yeah, gonna need you to sign this.

04:55.470 --> 04:59.240
- What is it?
- Just a simple contract.

04:59.280 --> 05:01.240
That I downloaded from the Internet.

05:01.280 --> 05:03.380
Feel free to look it over.

05:03.410 --> 05:06.780
Whoa, a lot of words here.

05:06.820 --> 05:09.350
It's pretty standard.

05:09.390 --> 05:11.350
It just says you'll pay me back some money.

05:11.390 --> 05:13.820
And some, you know, other stuff.

05:13.860 --> 05:17.290
Good enough for me.

05:17.330 --> 05:19.290
Okay.

05:19.330 --> 05:24.100
You signed
where it says "date."

05:24.130 --> 05:26.940
And thinking that might happen,

05:26.970 --> 05:29.470
Here's another copy.

05:32.640 --> 05:35.940
And then Charlie bit him.
Why would she do that?

05:35.980 --> 05:38.350
Was he dressed like a giant cookie?

05:38.380 --> 05:40.850
Yes, Ivy.

05:40.880 --> 05:44.220
Spencer was dressed like a giant cookie.

05:44.250 --> 05:46.020
I'm serious.

05:46.060 --> 05:48.360
Charlie's never done this
before, like, with anyone.

05:48.390 --> 05:51.330
Well, maybe Charlie senses there's
something wrong with Spencer.

05:51.360 --> 05:53.160
You know what they say...

05:53.200 --> 05:55.900
Dogs and kids are the best
judges of character.

05:55.930 --> 05:59.570
Yeah, what could possibly
be wrong with Spencer?

05:59.600 --> 06:01.870
He's good looking.
He's smart.

06:01.900 --> 06:03.870
He's Captain of the football team.

06:03.910 --> 06:06.210
And he likes me.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.580
But how much do you really know about him?

06:08.610 --> 06:12.380
Spencer could be hiding something.
Everybody has a secret.

06:12.420 --> 06:14.380
Oh yeah?

06:14.420 --> 06:16.420
What's your secret?

06:16.450 --> 06:19.190
I love country music.
There, I said it.

06:21.860 --> 06:24.160
- You do not.
- Oh?

06:24.190 --> 06:26.260
Check this out.

06:29.670 --> 06:33.130
Oh yeah.

06:33.170 --> 06:36.300
Come on, do it with me.

06:36.340 --> 06:38.840
You know you want to.

06:38.870 --> 06:40.980
Oh, what the heck.

06:42.450 --> 06:44.410
To the left.

06:44.450 --> 06:46.410
To the back.

06:46.450 --> 06:48.480
Kick it.

06:54.760 --> 06:56.690
What do you think, mom?

06:56.730 --> 06:58.660
Wow, it's...

06:58.690 --> 07:01.330
It's a car.

07:01.360 --> 07:03.130
Where did you get it?

07:03.170 --> 07:05.000
It used to belong to my friend's grandma.

07:05.030 --> 07:06.670
Oh, did she stop driving?

07:06.700 --> 07:08.670
No, breathing.

07:08.700 --> 07:10.670
She was on her way to a buffet.

07:10.710 --> 07:12.770
And took a detour to heaven.

07:12.810 --> 07:14.240
Oh no.

07:14.280 --> 07:16.110
Luckily she was at a stop sign,

07:16.150 --> 07:19.710
So there was no body
damage... to the car, I mean.

07:19.750 --> 07:23.050
Okay, so she passed away in here?

07:23.090 --> 07:24.550
Right where you're sitting.

07:24.590 --> 07:26.450
And I'm out.

07:30.130 --> 07:31.390
Ahh.

07:31.430 --> 07:35.800
Ah, the new car smell.

07:35.830 --> 07:38.070
Or is it death?

07:40.340 --> 07:42.970
Take me to the arcade.
Step on it.

07:43.010 --> 07:44.810
Excuse me?

07:44.840 --> 07:47.780
Arcade... place for
fun and games.

07:47.810 --> 07:51.250
Step on it...
to drive quickly.

07:51.280 --> 07:53.420
I'm not taking you anywhere.

07:53.450 --> 07:56.380
I guess somebody didn't read his contract,

07:56.420 --> 07:59.220
Which clearly States.

07:59.260 --> 08:01.660
That you have to give me a ride.

08:01.690 --> 08:04.830
Whenever and wherever I want.

08:04.860 --> 08:07.030
You tricked me.

08:08.530 --> 08:11.630
Here, I brought you
a cute little cap to wear.

08:11.670 --> 08:14.240
While you're driving me around.

08:16.000 --> 08:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:23.280 --> 08:25.480
- Hey, Spencer.
- What's up?

08:25.510 --> 08:27.520
I just wanted to see if we
were still on for tonight.

08:27.550 --> 08:29.550
My mom's working, so it's
just gonna be you and me.

08:29.590 --> 08:31.690
- That's great.
- And of course Charlie.

08:31.720 --> 08:34.690
Oh, wait a minute.

08:34.720 --> 08:37.090
Tonight? I totally forgot.
I have a thing.

08:37.130 --> 08:38.760
A thing?
What kind of thing?

08:38.789 --> 08:40.760
It's a family thing.
I can't get out of it.

08:40.799 --> 08:42.230
Oh really?
Are you sure?

08:42.260 --> 08:46.000
Honey, he's not coming.

08:46.040 --> 08:50.410
Now chop me up something
and put it in the blender.

09:00.080 --> 09:03.050
Hey, I thought you said you had a thing.

09:03.090 --> 09:05.550
Yeah, but I think we need to talk.

09:05.590 --> 09:06.820
Oh, okay.
Come on in.

09:06.860 --> 09:08.490
I'd rather do this out here.

09:08.520 --> 09:09.660
Okay.

09:09.690 --> 09:13.130
What's going on?

09:13.160 --> 09:15.030
Teddy, I don't think this is working out.

09:15.060 --> 09:16.430
What's not working out?

09:16.470 --> 09:17.800
Us.

09:17.830 --> 09:19.800
Wait a minute.

09:19.840 --> 09:21.870
Are you breaking up with me?

09:21.900 --> 09:23.640
Yes.

09:23.670 --> 09:25.340
Why?

09:25.370 --> 09:28.280
Because of her.

09:33.820 --> 09:35.520
Spencer, wait!

09:36.820 --> 09:38.620
Spencer!
Spencer!

09:41.300 --> 09:45.260
It was just a dream.

09:55.230 --> 09:57.600
Oh, Teddy honey, I almost forgot.

09:57.630 --> 10:00.340
I'm gonna need you to watch Charlie after school.
I have a dentist's appointment.

10:00.370 --> 10:02.300
No, I can't watch Charlie.
I have plans.

10:02.340 --> 10:04.140
I was gonna go surprise Spencer at work.

10:04.170 --> 10:06.640
Teddy, I've had a temporary crown.

10:06.680 --> 10:08.640
Since I was pregnant.

10:08.680 --> 10:10.650
With you.

10:10.680 --> 10:14.850
Mom, mom, mom, Charlie's been
driving Spencer and I apart.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.790
And if I don't go see him today,

10:16.820 --> 10:18.850
Our entire relationship might be at stake.

10:18.890 --> 10:21.960
Whoa. Okay,
calm down here.

10:21.990 --> 10:24.630
I was a teenager once.
I know what you're going through.

10:24.660 --> 10:27.060
And I'm gonna say to you exactly
what my mom said to me.

10:27.100 --> 10:28.700
In times like this...

10:28.730 --> 10:30.230
Get over it.

10:30.270 --> 10:33.040
That's so unfair.

10:33.070 --> 10:34.700
"deal with it," she said to me.

10:34.740 --> 10:37.070
You're ruining my life.

10:37.110 --> 10:39.210
I said to her.

10:39.240 --> 10:41.980
Now I could give you the
rest of the conversation,

10:42.010 --> 10:44.180
But let's just cut to the
chase... you're babysitting.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.190
<i>Strangling me</i>
<i>is not gonna help.</i>

10:53.560 --> 10:55.520
Dad, dad, dad!

10:55.560 --> 10:57.860
Hey! Hey!

10:57.890 --> 10:59.860
Help me, dad!

10:59.900 --> 11:03.170
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

11:03.200 --> 11:06.340
- What is going on?
- He says he owns my car now.

11:06.370 --> 11:08.340
You refused to take me
where I wanted to go,

11:08.370 --> 11:10.610
Which means you're in
violation of our contract.

11:10.640 --> 11:13.180
- What contract?
- Here, read this for yourself.

11:15.810 --> 11:19.480
Whoa, a lot of words here.

11:19.520 --> 11:21.480
It clearly States.

11:21.520 --> 11:23.620
That if P.J. Doesn't
drive me wherever I want,

11:23.650 --> 11:24.920
The old lady's car is mine.

11:24.950 --> 11:28.020
P.J., you did sign it.

11:28.060 --> 11:29.790
Dad, it isn't fair.
He tricked me.

11:29.830 --> 11:33.160
Okay okay, all right,
all right, here we go.

11:33.200 --> 11:35.160
The hard part about being a dad...

11:35.200 --> 11:36.700
Making the tough decisions, right?

11:36.730 --> 11:40.700
So my decision...

11:40.740 --> 11:43.340
Uh, check page five, third paragraph.

11:49.080 --> 11:51.050
"this contract is not subject.

11:51.080 --> 11:53.780
R= arbitration
by Bob Duncan."

11:53.820 --> 11:55.820
Huh.

11:55.850 --> 11:58.620
Sorry, P.J.,
my hands are tied.

11:58.660 --> 12:01.560
Can I at least hurt him a little?

12:02.590 --> 12:04.590
No.

12:18.440 --> 12:20.980
Giddy-up.

12:25.950 --> 12:28.580
Boy, you've really embraced.

12:28.620 --> 12:30.650
The whole country Western thing.

12:30.690 --> 12:34.560
I've never felt so alive, y'all.

12:34.590 --> 12:38.630
I'm happy as a Turkey
the day after Thanksgiving,

12:38.660 --> 12:41.800
'cause it didn't get killed and eaten...

12:41.830 --> 12:43.600
Y'all.

12:43.630 --> 12:46.240
Yeah, real country people.

12:46.270 --> 12:48.240
Don't say "y'all" after every sentence.

12:48.270 --> 12:50.240
I think you let them say what they want.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.240
When they're babysitting your sister.

12:52.280 --> 12:55.240
Right. So Charlie's
upstairs taking a nap.

12:55.280 --> 12:57.280
And when she wakes up,
she might be a little hungry.

12:57.310 --> 13:00.450
Don't worry, partner.
I'll rustle her up some grub.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.450
Okay, well,

13:02.490 --> 13:05.590
I'd better hop in the saddle
and mosey on down to the mall.

13:05.620 --> 13:08.390
Before Spencer's shift ends.

13:08.420 --> 13:11.630
Yeah, it's only cool when I do it.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.840
What's wrong with you?

13:22.870 --> 13:26.240
You want the car?
Here, take it.

13:26.280 --> 13:28.740
I hope I never see it again.

13:28.780 --> 13:32.080
- What are you talking about?
- Okay, she's in it.

13:32.120 --> 13:34.080
- Who is?
- The old lady.

13:34.120 --> 13:38.450
She did not go to heaven.
She just went to the back seat.

13:38.490 --> 13:40.590
Really?

13:40.620 --> 13:42.560
You're saying the old lady's
ghost is haunting your car?

13:42.590 --> 13:44.990
No, she's haunting your car.

13:46.600 --> 13:48.730
What happened?

13:48.770 --> 13:50.200
I was just driving.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.200
And the radio goes on all by itself...

13:52.240 --> 13:54.670
Classical music.
I don't listen to that.

13:54.700 --> 13:57.570
Then I smell perfume...

13:57.610 --> 14:00.810
Old lady perfume.
I don't wear that.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.980
You're crazy.

14:04.010 --> 14:06.980
Dad, will you please tell him
there's no such thing as ghosts?

14:07.020 --> 14:10.290
I wish I could, Gabe.

14:10.320 --> 14:13.060
I wish I could.

14:13.090 --> 14:14.960
You believe in ghosts too?

14:14.990 --> 14:16.960
Well, I didn't used to.

14:16.990 --> 14:19.390
And then came the fontana house.

14:19.430 --> 14:21.400
I'm telling you,

14:21.430 --> 14:23.400
It seemed like a routine extermination...

14:23.430 --> 14:25.900
A black widow nest up in the attic.

14:25.940 --> 14:27.900
But the widow.

14:27.940 --> 14:31.070
Turned out to be
Mrs. Fontana...

14:31.110 --> 14:34.040
The late Mrs. Fontana.

14:34.080 --> 14:37.150
"late" means "dead."

14:37.180 --> 14:39.150
You guys are just trying to scare me.

14:39.180 --> 14:42.520
I wish we were, Gabe.
I wish we were.

14:42.550 --> 14:44.720
Why are you saying everything twice?

14:44.750 --> 14:47.460
I don't know, Gabe.

14:47.490 --> 14:49.060
I don't know.

14:49.090 --> 14:53.130
All right, enough.
I don't believe in ghosts.

14:53.160 --> 14:56.130
That car is not haunted.
And thank you.

14:56.170 --> 14:57.870
Don't say you weren't warned.

14:57.900 --> 14:59.870
And remember, if you go in that car,

14:59.900 --> 15:02.740
Beware of classical music,
smelly perfume...

15:02.770 --> 15:04.740
And murder.

15:04.770 --> 15:08.640
Dad, nobody was murdered in that car.

15:08.680 --> 15:10.610
Not yet.

15:31.100 --> 15:34.170
Don't move.
I'm in a relationship crisis.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.770
This is your lucky day.
I rarely move.

15:42.280 --> 15:45.750
- Spencer.
- Teddy.

15:45.780 --> 15:49.850
What's going on?
Are you cheating on me?

15:49.890 --> 15:51.320
What are you talking about?

15:51.350 --> 15:54.520
I saw you with your arm around that girl.

15:56.060 --> 15:59.360
You're cheating on me, aren't you?

15:59.400 --> 16:01.200
Attention, everybody.

16:01.230 --> 16:03.830
Juice boy here is a cheater.

16:03.870 --> 16:06.940
And he never gives me
a full serving either.

16:06.970 --> 16:08.940
Teddy, you've got it all wrong.

16:08.970 --> 16:10.940
Oh, okay, so you just put your arm around.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.270
All your customers, is that it?

16:12.310 --> 16:14.280
No, I put my arm around my cousin.

16:14.310 --> 16:16.880
- Your what?
- My cousin Skyler.

16:19.620 --> 16:21.580
Oh.

16:21.620 --> 16:23.590
Your cousin Skyler.

16:23.620 --> 16:26.520
She seems nice.

16:26.560 --> 16:29.620
It's okay, everybody.

16:29.660 --> 16:32.790
She's just his cousin.

16:32.830 --> 16:35.600
So return to your juices.

16:35.630 --> 16:37.570
Look, my break's over.
Maybe you should go.

16:37.600 --> 16:40.440
Yeah, sure.
I'm sorry.

16:40.470 --> 16:44.270
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

16:46.340 --> 16:49.210
I'm sorry too.

16:49.250 --> 16:51.650
It's the other kid who never fills it up.

16:53.620 --> 16:56.550
My own car.

16:56.590 --> 16:58.550
The open road,

16:58.590 --> 17:00.990
Freedom, wind in my hair,

17:01.020 --> 17:04.390
And it's all just six years away.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.970
Perfume?
No way.

17:19.910 --> 17:23.150
Very funny, P.J.

17:23.180 --> 17:27.050
P.J.? P.J.?

17:27.079 --> 17:31.220
<i>Get out of my car.</i>

17:33.490 --> 17:36.690
<i>Get out of my car,</i>

17:36.730 --> 17:39.660
<i>Little boy.</i>

17:39.700 --> 17:42.200
Who said that?

17:42.230 --> 17:45.830
<i>Or you can stay</i> <i>with me</i>

17:45.870 --> 17:50.040
<i>Forever and ever</i>
<i>and ever!</i>

17:56.610 --> 17:59.950
Mommy!
Mommy!

18:03.020 --> 18:04.990
Whew.

18:05.020 --> 18:06.660
That went well.

18:08.690 --> 18:12.530
Here, take your stupid car!

18:25.340 --> 18:28.510
Hi. You're Skyler, right?
I'm Teddy.

18:28.540 --> 18:31.980
Oh, right. I saw your picture
in Spencer's wallet.

18:32.010 --> 18:34.080
Spencer keeps my picture in his wallet?

18:34.120 --> 18:35.920
That's sweet.

18:35.950 --> 18:37.920
Of course I put it in there,

18:37.950 --> 18:40.760
But it's so sweet he didn't throw it out.

18:40.790 --> 18:42.760
What have you got there?

18:42.790 --> 18:44.630
- Pie on a stick.
- Where did you get it?

18:44.660 --> 18:46.530
Pie on a stick.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.600
It's just my way to say
"I'm sorry" to Spencer.

18:48.630 --> 18:50.370
Because I kind of freaked out earlier.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.000
I didn't know you two were cousins.

18:52.030 --> 18:54.870
I thought <i>you two</i> were cousins.

18:56.740 --> 18:59.310
No, Spencer's my boyfriend.

18:59.340 --> 19:01.310
No, Spencer's <i>my</i> boyfriend.

19:01.340 --> 19:03.380
Uh-oh.

19:03.410 --> 19:06.850
So you two have met, huh?

19:06.880 --> 19:09.750
Yeah, turns out we're cousins.

19:09.790 --> 19:12.090
Anything you want to say, Spencer?

19:14.490 --> 19:16.460
A free sample?

19:16.490 --> 19:19.230
Sure, I'd love one.

19:19.260 --> 19:21.430
Mm, delicious.

19:21.460 --> 19:23.500
You should try some.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.740
Don't forget dessert.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.640
Hey, wait.

19:32.680 --> 19:35.110
How could you?

19:35.140 --> 19:37.610
- I'm sorry.
I can exp... - Just don't.

19:45.150 --> 19:48.690
Teddy honey, are you okay?

19:49.760 --> 19:52.260
No.

19:54.300 --> 19:56.730
Scoot over.

19:59.400 --> 20:02.100
Look, I know this probably
won't make you feel better,

20:02.140 --> 20:03.970
But I know what you're going through.

20:04.010 --> 20:07.440
So you had your heart broken too?

20:07.480 --> 20:10.910
I did.
By Warren snodgrass.

20:10.950 --> 20:13.950
Warren snodgrass?

20:13.980 --> 20:17.820
Yeah, he was a lot cuter than he sounds.

20:17.850 --> 20:19.820
Anyway, I was madly in love with him.

20:19.860 --> 20:21.820
And then one day out of the blue.

20:21.860 --> 20:23.830
He dumped me for Kim Brooks.

20:23.860 --> 20:25.390
I was devastated.

20:25.430 --> 20:28.260
So how did you deal with it?

20:28.300 --> 20:30.270
I didn't.

20:30.300 --> 20:32.770
I was a mess, thought my life was over.

20:32.800 --> 20:35.940
But then I started dating.

20:35.970 --> 20:38.810
This tall, blond goof ball named Bob.

20:38.840 --> 20:42.440
- Dad?
- No, Bob diddlebock.

20:42.480 --> 20:45.080
But he introduced me to dad.

20:45.110 --> 20:47.080
Look, honey, the point is.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.680
If I hadn't had my heart broken,

20:48.720 --> 20:50.350
I never would have met your father.

20:50.390 --> 20:53.790
Then I would have never been born.

20:53.820 --> 20:56.420
And I wouldn't be so sad right now.

20:56.460 --> 20:59.590
Oh, no no, honey.

20:59.630 --> 21:02.430
Oh, it's terrible, I know.

21:02.470 --> 21:04.430
It stinks.

21:04.470 --> 21:06.430
But you know what, babe?

21:06.470 --> 21:09.100
It will get better.
I promise.

21:13.210 --> 21:16.210
Hi, Charlie.
I'm here with your sister.

21:16.250 --> 21:18.580
Who's having her first broken heart.

21:18.610 --> 21:20.580
My first?

21:20.620 --> 21:23.050
There's gonna be more?

21:23.090 --> 21:25.120
No, honey, this is it.

21:26.590 --> 21:29.690
Anyway, by the time you're watching this,

21:29.730 --> 21:32.430
You might be experiencing
your first heartbreak.

21:32.460 --> 21:36.030
So just remember, it always gets better.

21:36.070 --> 21:39.300
And I just wanted to say.

21:39.340 --> 21:41.300
You were right about Spencer.

21:41.340 --> 21:43.300
It's too bad you won't have a little sister.

21:43.340 --> 21:46.070
Looking out for you when you're my age,

21:46.110 --> 21:48.080
Although we never know.

21:48.110 --> 21:50.080
Oh, we know.

21:50.140 --> 21:52.270
Good luck, Charlie.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.170
What the...?

22:02.200 --> 22:04.130
I'm sorry.

22:04.170 --> 22:05.740
Leave melone.

22:09.410 --> 22:11.380
No.

22:11.410 --> 22:12.810
No-o-o!

22:24.900 --> 22:27.130
You such a good sister.

22:27.450 --> 22:29.290
Come here. Come here
