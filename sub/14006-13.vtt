00:02.500 --> 00:05.100
The photos link 
Ray Fiske to Gregory Malina.

00:05.100 --> 00:07.400
Patty used it as leverage 
against Fiske.

00:07.700 --> 00:08.900
Do you regret what we did?

00:08.900 --> 00:09.800
Because I do.

00:10.600 --> 00:12.200
I did everything you asked me to.

00:12.300 --> 00:13.700
You said I'd be taken care of.

00:13.800 --> 00:17.200
Mr. Popler is leaking 
information to Frobisher's camp.

00:17.300 --> 00:18.200
Ellen, it's me.

00:18.500 --> 00:21.400
Katie brought you a videotape 
that Gregory Malina made.

00:21.500 --> 00:24.600
Do anything you have to do, 
but get me that tape.

00:25.500 --> 00:27.100
We went to Patty Hewes'apartment.

00:27.100 --> 00:28.200
We didn't find the tape.

00:28.300 --> 00:29.800
No matter what you think,

00:29.900 --> 00:33.300
- I didn't have anything to 
do with any of this.
- I know.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.900
I've been accused of murder, 
and you're going to exonerate me.

00:35.900 --> 00:37.100
Then I'll give you the tape.

00:37.200 --> 00:38.900
Ellen Parsons is out on bail.

00:39.100 --> 00:40.300
You know where to find her.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:03.600 --> 01:05.500
You have one new message.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.400
Ellen. Ellen, it's me.

01:07.900 --> 01:09.900
Look, there's something here 
that you really got to see.

01:10.300 --> 01:13.200
Katie brought you a videotape 
that Gregory Malina made.

01:20.900 --> 01:23.800
Gregory confessed everything 
about what happened in Florida.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.800
I'm going to leave it in our 
hiding place, okay?

02:15.400 --> 02:18.000
You go in, you get the tape, 
and you get out.

02:18.100 --> 02:18.800
- You ready?
- Yeah.

02:24.400 --> 02:25.200
Give me your penlight.

02:25.300 --> 02:26.700
- Where's yours?
- I'm not sure.

02:31.800 --> 02:33.500
Yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am.I'll take a look.

02:49.300 --> 02:50.200
David!

03:08.200 --> 03:10.900
Bloody, half-naked,?????a.m.?

03:10.900 --> 03:11.900
Just your type.

03:13.200 --> 03:14.000
You get a name?

03:14.200 --> 03:15.500
All we found on her was this.

03:17.200 --> 03:19.500
"Hollis M. Nye, Attorney-at-Law."

03:20.300 --> 03:21.300
You her lawyer?

03:21.500 --> 03:22.900
No. A friend.

03:23.200 --> 03:24.800
You have a current address?

03:25.000 --> 03:26.700
Yes, certainly.

03:28.500 --> 03:32.100
She, uh, she lives with her fianc?

03:32.200 --> 03:33.000
We have a problem.

03:33.600 --> 03:36.400
The police just came to see me 
Your mom made these for us.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.500
Your Mom made this for us

03:58.700 --> 04:01.700
I'm accused of murder, 
and my mom bakes cookies.

04:03.500 --> 04:04.700
Sounds about right.

04:06.200 --> 04:07.600
Who attacked you?

04:08.700 --> 04:09.700
I don't know.

04:10.400 --> 04:12.000
I never saw him before.

04:13.800 --> 04:18.100
Your mom said 
Patty Hewes posted the bail.

04:19.899 --> 04:21.300
She knows I'm innocent.

04:22.500 --> 04:23.900
She's representing me now.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.300
When is David's funeral?

04:28.700 --> 04:30.000
I can't go.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Why not?

04:33.400 --> 04:36.500
Conditions of my bail. I...

04:37.300 --> 04:38.400
I can't travel.

04:40.800 --> 04:43.500
Patty can petition the judge 
for an allowance.

04:44.300 --> 04:47.900
I don't know if David's family 
even wants me to be there.

04:51.200 --> 04:52.800
I am so sorry, El.

05:48.900 --> 05:51.600
Could you help me? 
I'm looking for Lot 77.

05:52.600 --> 05:56.500
Yeah, you want to stay on the path
then swing a right at the oak grove.

05:57.000 --> 05:57.800
Thank you.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.700
You don't look like 
you're from around here.

06:00.700 --> 06:02.100
It's been 35 years.

06:36.500 --> 06:37.400
Anything I can do?

06:41.400 --> 06:42.600
I'll be up in a minute.

06:59.300 --> 07:02.200
How does Ray Fiske's suicide 
affect our case?

07:02.600 --> 07:05.700
Judge Toomey granted the 
opposition a one-month continuance,

07:05.900 --> 07:09.000
which we expected 
under the circumstances.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
And Marshall Phillips has 
assumed lead counsel for Mr. Frobisher.

07:13.300 --> 07:14.300
He a good attorney?

07:14.400 --> 07:15.400
He's one of the best.

07:15.900 --> 07:19.100
Has there been another offer since 
we turned down the 500 million?

07:19.200 --> 07:20.800
No, not yet.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.300
I want to reiterate that 
none of what's happened

07:23.300 --> 07:25.000
can detract from our case.

07:25.100 --> 07:28.600
We know what Frobisher did, 
and we're ready to prove it to a jury.

07:29.500 --> 07:31.000
Your office is finished.

07:31.100 --> 07:33.100
I promise you, Patty,

07:33.500 --> 07:34.900
the place is as good as new.

07:35.800 --> 07:36.800
Thank you, Pete.

08:13.600 --> 08:18.600
DNA tests confirm that the blood of an 
unknown male was found in my apartment

08:18.900 --> 08:20.500
and on my client's clothing.

08:20.700 --> 08:23.200
That corroborates her story 
that she was attacked.

08:24.100 --> 08:26.600
By who? There was no body 
found in your apartment.

08:26.700 --> 08:30.200
Our detectives did a thorough 
search of the building,

08:30.200 --> 08:31.300
they talked to the neighbors.

08:31.300 --> 08:32.799
The blood evidence...

08:32.799 --> 08:34.799
Is inconclusive at best.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.700
No, Ms. Parsons still had the 
motive, the opportunity,

08:37.700 --> 08:42.200
and her fingerprints were in the 
victim's blood on the murder weapon.

08:42.299 --> 08:43.600
She explained that.

08:43.700 --> 08:46.200
Can you explain why her 
apartment was ransacked?

08:46.400 --> 08:49.000
A file cabinet broken into 
with contents stolen?

08:49.000 --> 08:53.500
I mean, not exactly consistent 
with a crime of passion, is it?

08:53.500 --> 08:56.800
Look, a young doctor was found 
murdered on Riverside Drive...

08:56.800 --> 08:58.300
And people are scared,

08:58.400 --> 09:00.400
which is why you want 
this to go away quickly.

09:00.400 --> 09:03.700
I mean, hell, if, if I lived on the 
Upper West Side,
I wouldn't sleep tonight.

09:04.500 --> 09:07.200
In fact, I might not want to 
re-elect my district attorney.

09:10.700 --> 09:13.000
Ms. Hewes, Ellen Parsons 
worked for you.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.700
I don't think you can be 
objective about this.

09:14.700 --> 09:16.600
I'm not! I'm not objective at all,

09:16.700 --> 09:18.200
and I'm going to turn my passionate,

09:18.200 --> 09:21.300
irrational anger against your office.

09:21.500 --> 09:24.200
I am going to go on every talk show,

09:24.200 --> 09:26.400
every media outlet I can find

09:26.400 --> 09:30.000
to expose how you 
ignored key evidence

09:30.000 --> 09:32.200
in your incompetent rush to accuse...

09:32.200 --> 09:34.600
- Ms. Hewes...
- ...how, for political ends,

09:34.600 --> 09:37.500
you destroyed the life of an 
exceptional young woman,

09:38.700 --> 09:41.800
while the real murderer 
walks the streets.

09:44.800 --> 09:47.300
This would be a lot more pleasant
if I were dealing with you, Hollis.

09:47.400 --> 09:49.200
I tried to reason with my client,

09:49.300 --> 09:51.600
but she insisted on 
Ms. Hewes representing her.

09:53.600 --> 09:54.500
What do you want?

09:55.300 --> 09:57.700
The DA's agreed to 
reopen the crime scene.

09:58.100 --> 09:58.700
Good.

09:58.900 --> 10:01.900
Ellen... you still know 
where the tape is?

10:03.000 --> 10:03.800
Of course.

10:05.300 --> 10:06.400
And it's safe?

10:07.200 --> 10:08.300
It's safe.

10:08.500 --> 10:10.600
Get the charges dropped, 
and it's yours.

10:15.800 --> 10:17.200
Ellen pushed me aside.

10:17.800 --> 10:18.500
Shit.

10:18.700 --> 10:19.800
Who's representing her now?

10:20.200 --> 10:21.300
Patty Hewes.

10:22.300 --> 10:25.200
She got the DA to reopen 
the murder investigation.

10:26.200 --> 10:28.100
All right, how would 
you like us to play it?

10:28.800 --> 10:30.500
Has the videotape been 
put into evidence?

10:31.500 --> 10:32.900
I don't think so. No.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.300
Then maybe Patty Hewes doesn't have it.

10:35.500 --> 10:37.500
What are we doing, 
playing guessing games?

10:37.500 --> 10:39.500
There's a goddamn gun 
out there pointed right at me,

10:39.500 --> 10:42.400
and you don't know 
if it's loaded. Jesus!

10:42.500 --> 10:43.900
What about David Connor?

10:44.400 --> 10:45.600
Do I have to worry about him?

10:47.300 --> 10:48.100
No.

10:49.400 --> 10:50.900
There's nothing that 
could get back to you.

10:52.700 --> 10:53.400
Good.

10:53.600 --> 10:54.900
Christ, what a mess.

11:01.600 --> 11:03.300
You're looking for 
anything incongruous,

11:04.300 --> 11:06.300
anything that didn't 
belong to you and your fianc?

11:08.300 --> 11:10.200
Anything that's not in the right place.

11:27.800 --> 11:28.500
Got to go.

11:58.200 --> 11:59.600
Take your time, Ms. Parsons.

12:20.500 --> 12:21.200
Excuse me.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.100
- Hey, Rick.
- How's it going?

12:25.600 --> 12:27.200
- Hey, Rosie.
- How you doing, Rick?

12:27.500 --> 12:30.300
This is Detective Rick Messer.
He asked if he could take a look around,

12:30.400 --> 12:34.400
see if the scene fits the profile 
of a case he's working downtown.

12:34.600 --> 12:35.400
Any luck?

12:35.800 --> 12:36.700
No.

12:39.900 --> 12:41.400
I'm very sorry for your loss.

12:43.600 --> 12:44.700
I hope they find the guy.

12:54.400 --> 12:55.500
Can we have a moment, please?

13:02.900 --> 13:03.700
Hi.

13:11.600 --> 13:14.300
I'm... sorry, Patricia.

13:16.300 --> 13:17.600
I'm terribly sorry.

13:26.700 --> 13:27.800
Mr. Frobisher?

13:29.000 --> 13:30.900
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.Yeah, I do.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.400
What...? 
She turned down $500 million, Larry.

13:35.400 --> 13:37.000
What the hell's going on over there?

13:37.300 --> 13:38.400
Does she have something?

13:38.500 --> 13:40.500
I don't know. 
She's not telling us anything.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.300
Then what do I have you for?

13:42.400 --> 13:45.500
Larry, you know, you haven't 
given me anything in weeks.

13:45.800 --> 13:46.700
What can I do?

13:48.200 --> 13:49.700
All right, look.

13:50.100 --> 13:53.300
Has she said anything 
about a videotape?

13:53.600 --> 13:57.500
Think-- a videotape? A confession?

13:57.700 --> 13:58.500
What? No.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.600
I don't know nothing about that.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.700
What tape? 
What are you talking about?

14:02.800 --> 14:04.100
No... forget it.

14:05.500 --> 14:07.100
I got to tell you,Mr. Frobisher,

14:07.700 --> 14:09.000
ever since your deposition, 

14:09.000 --> 14:10.600
I don't think she's going 
to settle for any amount.

14:10.600 --> 14:11.900
God damn it!

14:13.000 --> 14:15.700
You know something-- 
I don't pay you to think. Do I, Larry?

14:16.900 --> 14:18.800
You haven't paid me for 
anything, Mr. Frobisher...

14:18.800 --> 14:20.500
I need facts, all right?
I need information, that's all I want.

14:20.500 --> 14:22.500
Mr. Frobisher, I know!

14:22.800 --> 14:24.200
No, you actually don't know!

14:24.200 --> 14:26.300
You don't know shit, 
and you've done shit...

14:26.400 --> 14:28.500
which is exactly what you're 
going to get from me.

14:28.700 --> 14:30.100
I ain't paying you a penny.

14:30.200 --> 14:32.900
I don't need your money, you prick!

14:34.000 --> 14:35.400
I have to admit,

14:35.700 --> 14:37.600
I think there's something 
you're not telling me.

14:42.700 --> 14:45.000
Arthur, why hasn't this 
case already settled?

14:51.700 --> 14:52.600
What's this?

14:53.600 --> 14:56.200
Ray with Gregory Malina.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.600
Jesus.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.500
- Was Ray having a thing with this kid?
- I don't know.

15:05.800 --> 15:06.800
Maybe.

15:07.800 --> 15:10.800
I mean, the kid's a hustler, 
for Christ sake. He's a liar.

15:11.300 --> 15:14.100
Ray brought him down to 
Florida the same weekend I was there.

15:15.100 --> 15:18.500
The kid took advantage of him.
He tried to extort money from him.

15:18.800 --> 15:19.500
How?

15:19.600 --> 15:22.300
BI made up some bullshit videotape,

15:22.300 --> 15:24.400
confessing crap that never happened.

15:27.500 --> 15:29.700
What did happen in Florida, Arthur?

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
I stepped into that condo 
and she was staring right at me.

15:43.100 --> 15:45.200
That girl was high and out of her mind.

15:45.300 --> 15:47.300
My assistant assured me, 
she didn't see a thing.

15:47.300 --> 15:49.400
- And you believed him?
- Hey, relax.

15:49.800 --> 15:51.100
We'll take care of the girl.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.400
You have my word on that.

15:53.800 --> 15:54.700
Now tell me.

15:55.300 --> 15:56.200
It's not good.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.700
This is the report we're 
going to be filing next week.

16:00.900 --> 16:04.000
The SEC has evidence that the 
accounting fraud in your company

16:04.000 --> 16:05.300
has been going on for years.

16:06.100 --> 16:07.400
What kind of evidence?

16:07.500 --> 16:10.400
You use shell corporations to hide your debt.

16:10.600 --> 16:14.600
You book potential earnings as 
current earnings to artificially boost profits.

16:14.700 --> 16:17.700
I can't even tell what I'm looking at here.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.700
I've known you 40 years.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.100
Don't give me that shit, Arthur.

16:27.300 --> 16:28.400
Arthur...

16:28.800 --> 16:30.100
what happened in Florida?

16:31.500 --> 16:32.500
Nothing.

16:32.900 --> 16:34.500
Absolutely nothing.

16:38.200 --> 16:41.400
So this tape... have you viewed it?

16:43.000 --> 16:43.500
No.

16:43.700 --> 16:45.500
- Did Ray?
- I don't know.

16:45.700 --> 16:46.800
But...

16:47.800 --> 16:51.700
Malina wrote him a letter 
saying the tape was out there.

16:52.600 --> 16:53.900
And you think Patty has it?

16:55.500 --> 16:56.600
She might.

16:58.600 --> 16:59.600
Well...

17:01.000 --> 17:02.200
there's a way to find out.

17:02.800 --> 17:04.599
We file for summary judgment.

17:04.900 --> 17:07.099
We get the judge to rule on the case now.

17:07.300 --> 17:09.000
It'll force Patty to show her hand.

17:10.800 --> 17:12.300
But what if she does have the tape?

17:12.500 --> 17:14.700
Well, then at least we'll 
know where we stand.

17:15.099 --> 17:16.700
But if she doesn't,

17:16.900 --> 17:18.599
based on the evidence I've seen,

17:19.099 --> 17:21.500
I'm betting the judge will 
dismiss the whole case.

17:23.400 --> 17:25.200
Summary judgment.

17:25.800 --> 17:28.600
Why wait for a trial when a judge 
can decide the case now?

17:29.300 --> 17:33.000
If I file today, this all could 
be over by next month.

17:37.200 --> 17:38.500
We're going to trial.

17:41.800 --> 17:42.800
I'll be in touch.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.800
Turn this over to a judge? 
What is he, crazy?

17:55.100 --> 17:56.100
He's desperate.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.700
He needs to know if we have the tape.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.100
So Phillips is forcing your hand?

18:01.900 --> 18:03.100
I need the tape, Ellen.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
If the judge rules against us, 
we lose the case.

18:09.500 --> 18:10.800
That would be unfortunate.

18:11.700 --> 18:14.200
I'm doing everything I 
can to exonerate you.

18:14.800 --> 18:17.200
- I had the crime scene reopened... 
- There was nothing there.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.300
I've hired my own investigators.

18:19.600 --> 18:22.100
I'm puttI'g as much pressure 
on the DA as I can.

18:23.400 --> 18:24.400
I don't think so.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.100
He's a DA.

18:28.800 --> 18:30.500
DAs want to be reelected.

18:32.200 --> 18:33.600
Yes, they do.

18:33.900 --> 18:35.300
So cut a deal with him.

18:36.400 --> 18:37.700
Give him what he wants.

18:46.400 --> 18:49.800
Right over there, 
it's going to be the R&D building.

18:50.200 --> 18:51.200
You know what that is?

18:51.600 --> 18:52.300
Yeah.

18:52.400 --> 18:54.300
- It's research and development.
- There you go.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.600
That's the brain center of any company.

18:56.900 --> 18:58.800
Hub of creation, that's where...

18:59.500 --> 19:02.100
that's where dreams 
are forged into reality.

19:02.400 --> 19:03.800
Are we losing the house, Dad?

19:04.800 --> 19:07.300
Holly said she and Bethie 
are moving out to Aspen.

19:07.600 --> 19:09.400
Well, whatever happens,

19:09.400 --> 19:11.800
you're going to be living with 
your mom in San Diego.

19:12.500 --> 19:14.200
Well, why can't I stay here with you?

19:14.900 --> 19:16.500
I've got a lot on my plate right now.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.300
So what, I just have to pick up 
and just move across the country?

19:21.000 --> 19:22.100
Hey, you know something?

19:22.500 --> 19:23.900
You need to grow up.

19:24.400 --> 19:26.000
I'm dealing with some... 
Hey, listen to me.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.100
I'm dealing with some major shit here.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.900
I'm a guy who always lands on his feet.

19:31.100 --> 19:34.100
But right now, I need to focus 
on making things right.

19:34.600 --> 19:35.600
You understand that?

19:36.500 --> 19:38.300
No... Yeah. Whatever.

19:38.400 --> 19:40.800
Hey, come here. 
Come here, come here.

19:44.900 --> 19:46.600
I did something stupid, Owen.

19:47.900 --> 19:50.100
I made a... big mistake.

19:50.100 --> 19:52.100
I'm going to be paying for 
the rest of my life.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.300
What mistake?

19:56.300 --> 19:58.200
I trusted too many people.

20:10.700 --> 20:11.800
All right.

20:12.600 --> 20:13.800
What's it going to take?

20:15.200 --> 20:16.500
What's what going to take?

20:17.500 --> 20:21.800
For you to drop these preposterous 
charges against Ellen Parsons.

20:22.200 --> 20:24.000
You didn't find any new evidence.

20:28.300 --> 20:30.700
Let's cut the bullshit and talk business.

20:44.600 --> 20:45.700
You're a free woman.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.100
You struck a deal?

20:50.100 --> 20:52.000
The DA dropped the charges.

20:53.400 --> 20:55.500
The investigation's been reopened.

20:55.900 --> 20:58.600
They'll be a press 
conference later today.

21:01.100 --> 21:03.200
You can go to David's funeral now.

21:08.600 --> 21:09.500
Thank you.

21:10.100 --> 21:11.200
You're welcome.

21:20.300 --> 21:21.500
Now where's the tape?

21:26.100 --> 21:27.300
I don't have it.

21:29.100 --> 21:30.800
You told me you did.

21:31.900 --> 21:33.400
I told you it was safe.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.700
- You got five minutes.
- Thank you.

23:07.800 --> 23:08.700
Good evening.

23:12.700 --> 23:13.800
Got have a few minutes?

23:15.800 --> 23:17.400
In 2002...

23:18.400 --> 23:19.800
I met Ray Fiske.

23:20.800 --> 23:23.700
I didn't know this at the time,
but he was Arthur Frobisher's lawyer.

23:24.600 --> 23:28.300
Shortly after, Mr. Fiske sent me down
to Florida to help set up a meeting.

23:29.900 --> 23:31.800
I didn't know what this 
meeting was about,

23:33.100 --> 23:36.600
but I know that 
Arthur Frobisher was in contact

23:36.600 --> 23:39.300
with a member of the Securities 
and Exchange Commission.

23:40.200 --> 23:41.700
The name of that member is...

23:43.200 --> 23:44.900
George Moore...

23:46.200 --> 23:47.700
tipped you off.

23:51.800 --> 23:55.800
That's going to get you quite a 
few years in the federal penitentiary.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.400
Tell me what you want.

24:03.100 --> 24:05.600
Well, we have a couple of options.

24:09.200 --> 24:10.300
What are they?

24:11.100 --> 24:14.200
If I turn this over to the U.S. 
attorney's office,

24:14.200 --> 24:16.500
you either plead guilty

24:17.200 --> 24:18.800
or you fight it in court.

24:19.400 --> 24:22.500
Either way, you lose years of your life,

24:23.400 --> 24:25.300
and I'm still waiting in the wings

24:25.300 --> 24:27.600
to bleed you dry in a civil trial.

24:29.800 --> 24:31.100
And the other option?

24:31.800 --> 24:33.000
We settle.

24:34.700 --> 24:36.100
At my price.

24:39.300 --> 24:40.500
The videotape?

24:40.800 --> 24:42.300
It goes away forever.

24:44.500 --> 24:47.000
You'll sign a 
non disclosure agreement?

24:48.900 --> 24:52.400
All the evidence I have against 
you will never come to light.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.300
So think about it.

25:00.400 --> 25:02.800
But not for too long. 

25:03.500 --> 25:06.400
If I don't hear from you by the 
end of the day tomorrow,

25:08.000 --> 25:10.900
I'm going to treat some friends 
of mine at the Justice Department

25:10.900 --> 25:12.700
to dinner and a movie.

25:18.100 --> 25:19.900
Boy, you really enjoy this, don't you?

25:21.600 --> 25:22.800
It's my job.

25:26.200 --> 25:27.800
Why do you hate me so much?

25:42.800 --> 25:45.500
Someone was attacked in our home.
You haven't said a word about it.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.100
I didn't get attacked.

25:48.100 --> 25:49.700
Ellen saw you, Michael.

25:52.700 --> 25:54.800
You said you were going to 
Henry's house for the weekend.

25:54.800 --> 25:55.700
I did.

25:56.500 --> 25:57.600
Then what were you doing here?

25:57.900 --> 26:00.100
I left my laptop,

26:00.500 --> 26:02.200
so Why, am I a suspect?

26:03.200 --> 26:04.000
No.

26:04.100 --> 26:05.900
Then why are you interrogating me?

26:06.300 --> 26:09.200
We'd just like to know why 
you feel the need to lie.

26:10.600 --> 26:12.200
Maybe it just runs in the family.

26:17.300 --> 26:19.600
I've gone over all of it with 
your money managers.

26:19.800 --> 26:23.900
Now, remember, this is just a theoretical 
dismantling of your asset structure.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.300
What did they come up with?

26:26.100 --> 26:28.800
You'd have to give up 
93% of your net worth.

26:29.700 --> 26:33.200
They'd start with your 
bonds preferred stock,

26:33.300 --> 26:34.900
and then move on to real estate.

26:36.100 --> 26:38.700
- The houses?
- Yes, all the houses.

26:42.700 --> 26:43.600
Fine.

26:45.300 --> 26:46.700
Liquidate all of it.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.400
Foreign holdings, domestic holdings.

26:50.600 --> 26:52.500
I don't really care about anything else,

26:52.500 --> 26:56.000
but I need to know that I can keep the
new land that I'm developing.

26:56.500 --> 26:59.000
Arthur, you don't have to do this.
We could still win.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.400
Can I keep the goddamn land, Marshall?

27:02.800 --> 27:03.500
Yes.

27:03.800 --> 27:04.800
Promise me that.

27:05.300 --> 27:07.800
We would find a way for 
you to keep your land.

27:10.500 --> 27:11.200
All right.

27:13.700 --> 27:14.500
Pay her.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.100
Arthur, this is ludicrous.

27:17.100 --> 27:19.300
Let's just cool down 
and think this through.

27:19.300 --> 27:22.400
I have thought it through, 
Marshall, and it's my call.

27:22.700 --> 27:23.500
Pay her.

27:23.800 --> 27:25.800
What about our motion for 
summary judgment?

27:26.600 --> 27:29.400
A settlement like you're talking about,
we have nothing to lose.

27:30.500 --> 27:32.300
I have everything to lose, Marshall.

27:32.500 --> 27:34.200
That number is astronomical.

27:34.300 --> 27:37.200
Even if we lose at trial,
you may never have to pay a figure so high.

27:37.900 --> 27:41.800
I'll give a jury a dozen reasons
to award your employees less than that.

27:42.500 --> 27:43.400
Marshall...

27:44.300 --> 27:47.400
I will build all this back up 
again, believe me.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.800
But right now, I'm done with this.

27:50.600 --> 27:51.900
I need to move on.

27:57.900 --> 28:00.300
Miss Hewes, 
Marshall Phillips is here to see you.

28:00.300 --> 28:02.200
Thank you, Betty. Send him in.

28:05.800 --> 28:06.500
Marshall.

28:07.100 --> 28:08.500
This is a surprise.

28:08.900 --> 28:10.300
Oh, I doubt that.

28:10.600 --> 28:11.500
Please.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.800
Can you believe it's almost fall?

28:18.000 --> 28:19.100
What sign are you?

28:21.000 --> 28:23.300
We're dropping our motion 
for summary judgment.

28:23.900 --> 28:26.400
My client has instructed me

28:26.400 --> 28:29.700
to extend to you this settlement offer.

28:31.200 --> 28:32.300
There's a condition.

28:33.400 --> 28:35.200
He wants a nondisclosure agreement.

28:35.600 --> 28:37.200
All evidence sealed.

28:37.600 --> 28:38.700
Nothing comes out.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.900
Whatever you've got is buried.

28:41.400 --> 28:43.300
Otherwise, the offer evaporates.

28:43.500 --> 28:44.500
Understood.

29:00.400 --> 29:02.000
Tell him we accept.

29:06.300 --> 29:08.500
- You knew my father, didn't you?
- Mm-hmm.

29:09.900 --> 29:11.200
I never liked him.

29:11.600 --> 29:12.900
Oh, he never liked you.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.900
He always thought your 
cases had a stink to them.

29:18.600 --> 29:20.000
Good to see you, Marshall.

29:26.500 --> 29:29.100
Together, we hit a few 
bumps along the way,

29:29.500 --> 29:30.700
but in the end

29:31.000 --> 29:34.300
you believed in me and in 
our justice system.

29:34.900 --> 29:38.100
Your trust won this case.

29:41.600 --> 29:42.600
Ah... there we go.

29:45.600 --> 29:46.300
Here we go.

29:47.300 --> 29:48.300
There we are.

29:48.800 --> 29:50.300
We're billing you for this by the way.

29:52.200 --> 29:53.200
Congratulations.

29:53.400 --> 29:55.200
Cheers!

29:58.000 --> 29:59.900
Hear! Hear!

30:01.500 --> 30:03.000
There's a psychiatrist there.

30:03.200 --> 30:04.900
- Why'd you come in this room?
- Larry?

30:05.600 --> 30:06.800
- Do you have a moment?
- "The light was on."

30:16.800 --> 30:19.100
Don't sit, Larry. This won't take long.

30:21.900 --> 30:22.800
What's going on?

30:27.000 --> 30:29.700
We know you were leaking 
information to Frobisher.

30:30.900 --> 30:34.400
We want you to disclaim your 
interest in the settlement,

30:34.680 --> 30:35.900
voluntarily.

30:39.600 --> 30:41.900
And cut myself out of two billion?

30:43.100 --> 30:44.600
You gotta be kidding me.

30:44.700 --> 30:47.900
If you don't remove yourself, we'll turn 
you over to the U.S. attorney's office.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.100
It's your choice.

30:53.600 --> 30:55.500
But I made amends.

30:57.700 --> 30:59.500
They've made their decision, Larry.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.400
Hey, I'm 70 years old.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.400
I lost everything.

31:06.600 --> 31:09.300
The man came to me.
What was I supposed to do, huh?

31:09.800 --> 31:10.700
Huh?

31:15.300 --> 31:17.400
What am I gonna do now?!

31:20.300 --> 31:21.300
Ellen.

31:22.300 --> 31:23.200
Before you go?

31:24.200 --> 31:25.800
If you'll excuse me? Sure.

31:34.300 --> 31:36.100
Your first victory as an attorney.

31:44.400 --> 31:48.200
Have you given any thought
to what you're going to do next?

31:49.600 --> 31:51.200
I don't much care at the moment.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.800
Your office is still empty.

31:55.200 --> 31:57.500
I'm sure someone will 
make good use of it.

32:00.200 --> 32:01.600
The job is yours, Ellen.

32:01.900 --> 32:03.200
Anytime you're ready.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.200
Thanks for the drink.

32:15.800 --> 32:16.700
Ellen.

32:17.300 --> 32:18.200
Mr. Nye.

32:18.800 --> 32:19.800
Get in the car.

32:34.900 --> 32:36.400
They know what you did, Ellen.

32:40.800 --> 32:41.600
Who are you?

32:42.500 --> 32:45.700
I'm Agent Harrison. 
This is Agent Werner.
We're with the FBI.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.300
Miss Parsons, 
the night of Ray Fiske's suicide,

32:49.300 --> 32:51.400
you were seen leaving 
Hewes & Associates.

32:58.500 --> 32:59.500
I worked there.

33:00.200 --> 33:01.700
You were fired at the time.

33:02.800 --> 33:03.900
What is this about?

33:04.800 --> 33:06.400
It's about Patricia Hewes.

33:07.600 --> 33:08.800
And the Frobisher case?

33:09.600 --> 33:12.800
No, we were investigating Ms. Hewes 
long before the Frobisher case.

33:15.200 --> 33:17.500
Arthur Frobisher had my fiance killed,

33:17.500 --> 33:19.300
and you're investigating Patty Hewes?

33:19.400 --> 33:22.900
I tried to warn you, Ellen, 
not to take the job.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.200
You talk to us,

33:24.900 --> 33:27.100
maybe we overlook what you 
were doing there that night.

33:28.400 --> 33:30.100
ARis is your leverage?

33:31.900 --> 33:33.400
You're gonna have to do better than that,

33:33.400 --> 33:35.800
this picture means nothing.

33:38.100 --> 33:39.800
You don't want us pursuing it.

33:41.600 --> 33:42.800
Go ahead.

33:44.800 --> 33:46.000
Thanks for the chat.

34:06.800 --> 34:08.500
We commend our brother, David Connor,

34:09.600 --> 34:10.699
unto you, Lord,

34:11.400 --> 34:13.199
now that he has passed from this life.

34:13.800 --> 34:15.800
May he live on in Your presence.

34:16.900 --> 34:20.900
Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord,
and let perpetual light shine upon him.

34:21.500 --> 34:23.000
May he rest in peace.

34:23.600 --> 34:26.500
May his soul, and the souls 
of the faithful departed,

34:26.500 --> 34:29.199
through the mercy of God, 
rest in peace. Amen.

34:29.300 --> 34:30.800
Amen.

35:09.200 --> 35:10.800
I'm trying to forgive you.

35:24.500 --> 35:25.600
You don't have to.

35:27.200 --> 35:28.600
It's my fault.

35:29.600 --> 35:30.200
No.

35:31.800 --> 35:34.900
This whole thing started because 
I took Frobisher's money.

35:39.200 --> 35:40.100
The last time...

35:41.000 --> 35:42.800
the last time I saw David...

35:45.700 --> 35:47.000
we had a fight.

35:50.700 --> 35:52.000
And he was right.

35:54.600 --> 35:56.300
He was right about everything.

36:00.800 --> 36:03.900
Thank you for... 
thank you for letting me come today.

36:06.100 --> 36:07.600
David would have wanted you here.

36:13.600 --> 36:15.700
I know you're not the 
enemy in all of this.

36:17.900 --> 36:19.100
Thank you.

36:20.600 --> 36:22.500
Call me when you get 
back to New York.

37:04.500 --> 37:05.300
Okay, let me know.

37:14.700 --> 37:15.600
We're square.

37:15.900 --> 37:17.000
Indeed, we are.

37:19.600 --> 37:21.200
You didn't get this from me.

37:22.100 --> 37:24.100
You sound like my college girlfriend.

37:24.700 --> 37:26.600
Sit on it till the next election.

37:27.400 --> 37:30.200
When it comes out, 
there'll be a lot more lawsuits.

37:30.800 --> 37:34.300
Shareholders are going to go after 
the rest of Frobisher's fortune.

37:36.600 --> 37:38.400
And you can send him to jail.

38:05.000 --> 38:05.900
Hey!

38:16.100 --> 38:17.600
Now we're even.

38:26.900 --> 38:27.900
Oh, God.

38:49.700 --> 38:51.900
I've been in touch with the 
DA's office every day.

38:52.200 --> 38:53.200
And what have they found?

38:54.500 --> 38:58.200
Well, they've turned the 
crime scene inside out, but...

39:00.100 --> 39:02.400
even if they find the guys who did this...

39:02.500 --> 39:04.400
They'll never trace them 
back to Frobisher?

39:06.100 --> 39:06.900
I'm sorry.

39:10.300 --> 39:13.000
So, Patty tells me that you're not 
coming back to work.

39:14.500 --> 39:15.900
So you're in the loop again.

39:17.300 --> 39:20.600
Now that you're partner,
you must have got a nice chunk of 
change from that settlement.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.200
Yeah. Yeah.

39:25.600 --> 39:26.600
So...

39:27.500 --> 39:29.800
what did, what did you and Patty do

39:31.000 --> 39:32.100
to win this thing?

39:34.300 --> 39:35.800
Enjoy your money,Tom.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.700
There's a lot of great charities out there.

39:42.900 --> 39:44.300
Hey, can I ask you something?

39:45.600 --> 39:46.500
Sure.

39:47.500 --> 39:50.100
When Patty went away,
did she ever tell you where she went?

39:50.500 --> 39:51.300
No.

39:51.600 --> 39:53.300
Told me she was visiting family.

40:32.500 --> 40:35.400
You, uh, had a little girl.

40:36.900 --> 40:38.600
She died before delivery.

40:42.800 --> 40:44.200
May I ask...

40:46.500 --> 40:50.000
is there a name you'd like on the certificate?

41:39.600 --> 41:40.700
You wanted to speak with me?

41:48.300 --> 41:50.800
The other night at my apartment...

41:52.700 --> 41:54.000
you asked me

41:55.600 --> 41:58.500
if I regret what we did.

42:01.600 --> 42:03.300
I want you to know...

42:08.800 --> 42:10.000
...that I do.

42:13.700 --> 42:15.900
I deeply regret it.

42:18.500 --> 42:20.200
Why are you telling me this now?

42:23.800 --> 42:25.000
Because you're right.

42:27.400 --> 42:28.600
I've lied.

42:29.700 --> 42:31.300
I hired you to get to Katie.

42:31.400 --> 42:35.100
I've... manipulated you.

42:41.300 --> 42:43.200
I am ashamed of what I did.

42:46.400 --> 42:48.200
I hope you can forgive me.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.200
Someday.

43:00.700 --> 43:01.800
I have...

43:03.300 --> 43:05.700
...a lot of flaws.

43:10.100 --> 43:11.600
Come back, Ellen.

43:14.400 --> 43:16.000
Give me a second chance.

43:28.600 --> 43:31.100
I was thinking of going away for a while.

43:37.500 --> 43:39.300
Without David, I...

43:40.100 --> 43:41.800
I don't have a reason to be anywhere.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.100
I understand.

43:49.500 --> 43:51.300
I don't believe in the law anymore.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.600
But I believe in justice.

44:00.900 --> 44:02.400
So I'll come work for you again.

44:05.500 --> 44:06.700
On one condition.

44:10.400 --> 44:11.200
What's that?

44:12.400 --> 44:16.300
Let me use the firm's resources to prove
that Frobisher had David killed.

44:21.400 --> 44:22.200
It's a deal.

44:31.500 --> 44:32.200
Ellen?

44:39.600 --> 44:40.500
Thank you.

44:41.700 --> 44:42.700
You're welcome.

44:46.400 --> 44:47.700
Thanks for the chat.

45:10.200 --> 45:11.500
What are you looking at her for?

45:12.300 --> 45:16.000
Fraud, conspiracy, 
obstruction of justice.

45:16.700 --> 45:19.000
Now, Mr. Nye tells us you might 
have reasons of your own

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
for wanting to take down Ms. Hewes.

45:22.500 --> 45:23.200
Yes.

45:24.800 --> 45:25.600
I do.

45:27.900 --> 45:29.500
Do you regret what we did?

45:34.100 --> 45:35.200
Because I do.

45:40.100 --> 45:40.900
You do?

45:45.900 --> 45:49.100
While I'm gone, 
you're welcome to stay here.

46:11.100 --> 46:12.400
It's done.

46:47.500 --> 46:48.700
She tried to kill me.

46:50.300 --> 46:51.200
How do you know that?

46:53.500 --> 46:54.900
Because I know Patty.

46:58.900 --> 47:00.100
See you on Monday.

47:04.300 --> 47:06.500
You want me to go 
back and work for her?

47:07.000 --> 47:10.000
Ms. Parsons, you'll be working for us.

47:12.700 --> 47:13.700
See you Monday.
