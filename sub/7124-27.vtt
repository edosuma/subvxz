00:52.114 --> 00:54.464
That's the comet
you're supposed to follow.

00:56.758 --> 00:59.763
Right. Right. I knew that.

01:03.368 --> 01:06.076
Hey, be careful, okay? Hold on tight.

01:06.153 --> 01:08.629
It's okay.
I won't ever let you go.

01:08.867 --> 01:10.639
<i>That's... true.</i>

01:21.383 --> 01:23.953
Wow. Already? That was fast.

01:24.030 --> 01:26.777
Yep. We're here. It's time to wake up now.

01:26.854 --> 01:29.029
- What? Now?
- Yep.

01:29.106 --> 01:31.657
- Like,<i> right</i> now?
- Y...

01:32.904 --> 01:37.277
Ah. Where am I?

01:37.425 --> 01:39.247
What the heck?
Is that the comet?

01:39.459 --> 01:43.591
And a little farming village?
How long have I been walking?

01:43.699 --> 01:46.521
Man, two whole days... at least.

01:46.598 --> 01:51.130
- Wow. I need some water.
- No, wait... ah... geez.

01:52.030 --> 01:53.074
Hmm.

01:53.235 --> 01:55.392
Fields are looking a little sparse.

01:55.544 --> 01:56.953
Kind of runty.

01:57.072 --> 01:59.258
Wonder if this village even has any wat...

01:59.335 --> 02:01.100
oh, snap! I see some!

02:03.167 --> 02:04.243
Excuse me, sir.

02:04.320 --> 02:07.623
Could I have some water? I've
been sleepwalking for days.

02:08.473 --> 02:10.209
Awesome.

02:14.432 --> 02:15.401
Heck yeah!

02:15.478 --> 02:18.309
Thanks, little friend! You
just totally saved my life.

02:18.386 --> 02:19.819
No pun intended.

02:21.212 --> 02:23.541
What's the matter?
Can't talk? Oh.

02:23.618 --> 02:25.261
Or are you guys comet boyz?

02:25.338 --> 02:26.484
From up in there?

02:26.561 --> 02:28.314
Listen,
I'm no expert,

02:28.391 --> 02:30.532
but I think y'all are
gonna need a lot more corn.

02:30.609 --> 02:32.660
And it's supposed to
stand straight-up-like.

02:32.761 --> 02:34.877
Or maybe comet boyz
only need just, like, a

02:34.954 --> 02:37.402
- little bit of limp corn?
- No, I'm a regular guy.

02:37.479 --> 02:39.880
I... I'm just not supposed
to talk to strangers.

02:39.957 --> 02:43.009
Lionel, what did I tell you
about talking to strangers?!

02:43.086 --> 02:45.566
You get your butt inside
this instant!

02:45.759 --> 02:48.876
- Human boy!
- What the...?

02:48.953 --> 02:52.904
The tree spirit does
not permit freeloaders!

02:52.981 --> 02:57.970
Either help fetch the escape-pod
engine or kindly move along.

02:58.047 --> 02:59.951
- Dad?
- Wait! Wait!

03:00.028 --> 03:03.619
What are you doing?
Don't come over here!

03:04.521 --> 03:09.127
- Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. 
- Dad?

03:09.204 --> 03:10.886
Ptooooooooooooo!

03:10.963 --> 03:12.044
- Finn!
- Dad?

03:12.121 --> 03:13.881
- What the heck are you doing here?
- What the heck are you doing here?

03:13.958 --> 03:15.837
What?
You were just yelling at me.

03:15.914 --> 03:18.419
No, no, that was the tree spirit...

03:18.496 --> 03:22.502
commander of all trees,
bringer of hard times.

03:22.579 --> 03:23.610
Dad.

03:23.687 --> 03:25.589
You're not falling for it,
huh? Well,

03:25.666 --> 03:28.297
it was worth a try.
You know, those little guys down there,

03:28.374 --> 03:30.878
they'll do <i> anything</i>
for the tree spirit.

03:30.955 --> 03:33.494
I got them fetching
parts to fix my escape pod

03:33.571 --> 03:37.323
instead of planting their
fields. Isn't that sweet?

03:37.426 --> 03:39.093
Dad, your arm.

03:39.170 --> 03:41.663
Oh, this? Yeah.

03:41.740 --> 03:44.881
When my ship crashed, 
I got shot out of the window.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.812
I knocked a kite out of the air,

03:46.889 --> 03:50.679
then caught my arm in a woodpecker hole.

03:50.756 --> 03:51.879
Whoa.

03:51.981 --> 03:54.428
But it's cool, you know.
Arms come and go.

03:54.505 --> 03:57.042
It's <i> family</i>
that's important.

03:57.409 --> 03:59.292
Speaking of arms, though,

03:59.369 --> 04:00.896
I see you got yourself

04:00.973 --> 04:03.429
a brand-spankin'-new one.
How about that?!

04:03.506 --> 04:04.773
Oh. Yeah.

04:04.987 --> 04:08.056
- I-I got it from my P.B. dream sword.
- Uh-huh. Neat.

04:08.133 --> 04:09.871
Actually, for a while there,

04:09.948 --> 04:12.955
I thought if I ever saw you again,
I was gonna tear <i> your</i> arm off.

04:13.032 --> 04:15.683
Well, shoot. Who could blame you? Yeah.

04:15.760 --> 04:19.248
But you definitely don't
feel that way anymore, right?

04:19.325 --> 04:22.004
No. No. It's... it's okay now.

04:22.699 --> 04:24.325
Great! Great.

04:24.402 --> 04:25.843
How about hug?

04:27.178 --> 04:30.037
What the heck, dad?!
Is everything you say a lie?

04:30.114 --> 04:32.008
No, no. 'Course not.

04:32.089 --> 04:33.158
Well

04:33.278 --> 04:35.299
is there any way
I can tell the difference?

04:36.322 --> 04:37.832
I hope not.

04:38.229 --> 04:40.238
Hot dang! Hold that thought.

04:40.315 --> 04:43.631
Those little guys are back
with the engine bulb for my pod.

04:43.732 --> 04:44.855
Excuse me.

04:45.505 --> 04:48.769
I am sending
forth my holy emissary,

04:48.846 --> 04:50.440
Martin Mertens,

04:50.525 --> 04:53.484
and his regular son, Finn.

04:53.561 --> 04:57.429
Don't forget to do
whatever Martin tells you!

04:58.411 --> 05:00.713
Almost there. Little further.

05:00.790 --> 05:03.539
Uh-huh. Little further.
Keep it coming. There you go.

05:03.616 --> 05:08.425
A <i> little</i> further. And... stop.

05:09.258 --> 05:12.516
Fantastic work, boys. Absolutely fantastic.

05:12.593 --> 05:14.276
Holy stonk, dad!

05:14.400 --> 05:15.989
You're messing them all up!

05:16.108 --> 05:17.462
This is why
you're lying to them?

05:17.539 --> 05:19.088
So they'll mess themselves up for you?

05:19.165 --> 05:21.058
Wha?! No, no, no! Look...

05:21.135 --> 05:22.833
they love it.
See?

05:22.910 --> 05:24.568
Goochy goochy goo!

05:24.645 --> 05:26.351
Goochy goochy!

05:26.428 --> 05:28.208
They're helping a poor, old,

05:28.285 --> 05:30.023
stranded man in need.

05:30.100 --> 05:32.014
You like to help people, don't you?

05:32.091 --> 05:34.124
I... I'd do it myself if I could,

05:34.201 --> 05:37.455
but I'm too strong to fit
through the service hatches.

05:38.871 --> 05:41.272
Come on!
Gimme a chance!

05:42.939 --> 05:44.982
They're gonna fetch me
one last piece,

05:45.059 --> 05:46.998
and you and I can watch them do it.

05:47.075 --> 05:50.351
Then I'll be out of your
hair by tomorrow morning.

05:50.428 --> 05:51.710
Oh. Right.

05:52.053 --> 05:54.499
Yeah, don't worry.
I know I'm cramping your style

05:54.576 --> 05:57.564
- down here, am I right, huh?
- Uh... yeah.

05:57.641 --> 05:59.998
- Yeah, I... I guess.
- Sure I am!

06:00.075 --> 06:01.967
Now let's go fetch that piece.

06:05.445 --> 06:07.050
It's really warm down here.

06:07.127 --> 06:09.208
- Whoa!
- Well, yeah, son.

06:09.285 --> 06:12.390
That's just the ship cooking.
One thing about this ship...

06:12.467 --> 06:13.892
it cooks.

06:13.969 --> 06:15.411
<i>Should</i> it be cooking?

06:15.488 --> 06:17.393
Nah,
but that's just real life.

06:17.470 --> 06:20.686
Okay, babies, I need this piece.

06:20.763 --> 06:23.974
It's a steering wheel.
It's in the steering room.

06:27.752 --> 06:30.925
Last one in breaks tree spirit's heart!

06:31.335 --> 06:32.755
Wait! Wait! W-w-wait!

06:32.832 --> 06:34.684
You don't have to go in
there if you don't want to.

06:34.761 --> 06:37.019
Nah, I think we want to.

06:40.983 --> 06:43.850
Okay, I know, I know. Listen,

06:43.927 --> 06:46.166
that's the last piece of the pod, right?

06:46.243 --> 06:50.282
Well, I promise I'll make it up
to the little boogers tonight.

06:51.500 --> 06:52.778
Come here!

06:59.358 --> 07:02.798
Live it up, pals!
This is <i> your</i> night!

07:02.875 --> 07:04.755
Hey, hey!
Careful with the finish.

07:04.832 --> 07:06.809
That buggy's ready to blast.

07:09.197 --> 07:12.491
Yo! Party animals!
Still hungry?

07:12.568 --> 07:16.525
- Mm-nn-mm.
- Come on. Tree spirit says!

07:16.602 --> 07:22.018
Scoop it till you poop it! Let's get gross!

07:22.423 --> 07:24.379
- Finn?
- Oh. Sorry.

07:24.456 --> 07:26.943
So... you guys
want to learn another one?

07:27.435 --> 07:29.367
Okay, watch this.

07:33.383 --> 07:34.976
Cute.

07:35.263 --> 07:36.728
Uh, hey...

07:37.129 --> 07:39.821
So, you guys really
believe in the tree spirit?

07:39.898 --> 07:41.572
Eh, not really, I guess.

07:41.649 --> 07:43.243
We're kind of just looking
to help out.

07:43.320 --> 07:44.322
Hmm.

07:44.399 --> 07:47.924
Hey! It's Finn with the
grin! Mind if I sit down?

07:50.429 --> 07:51.495
Look at this!

07:51.572 --> 07:53.740
You ever see
someone sit like this?

07:53.817 --> 07:55.289
I guess not.

07:55.456 --> 07:56.712
Hey, Martin?

07:56.789 --> 07:58.423
- Yeah?
- Uh,

07:58.500 --> 08:01.390
I think I really need some
answers to stuff... like

08:01.467 --> 08:02.909
where did I come from or

08:02.986 --> 08:05.936
- who's my mom?
- Whoops.

08:08.224 --> 08:10.634
Okay, uh, long story short...

08:10.711 --> 08:14.135
you were born on a...
boat... I guess. Like a...

08:14.212 --> 08:15.660
banana boat...

08:16.162 --> 08:17.583
in the middle of the ocean.

08:17.660 --> 08:20.794
So all kinds of stuff tried
to eat you...

08:20.871 --> 08:25.028
whales and fish... squids.

08:25.169 --> 08:28.122
Uh, there was a tiger...

08:29.212 --> 08:31.701
and... seaweeds.

08:31.778 --> 08:34.957
- The sea's weeds.
- Finn:

08:35.034 --> 08:36.688
Your mom was...

08:36.789 --> 08:39.835
okay. I don't know. Talking
about it stresses me out.

08:39.912 --> 08:43.235
Maybe later. So, one day, I got called on a

08:43.312 --> 08:47.454
dangerous mission... no,
like a dangerous life choice,

08:47.641 --> 08:50.425
two roads diverging in
the night and all that.

08:50.502 --> 08:52.470
And I couldn't bring you along.

08:52.547 --> 08:55.462
I always planned to come
back for you, but I didn't.

08:55.989 --> 08:57.956
That's... true.

08:58.888 --> 09:00.590
The end!

09:03.272 --> 09:04.782
Look out!

09:10.031 --> 09:13.970
Everything is ruined.
Everyone is fat.

09:15.630 --> 09:17.298
Aah!

09:19.585 --> 09:22.121
- Martin!
- Again?

09:22.198 --> 09:24.177
Oh, good morning, sweetie!

09:24.254 --> 09:27.535
- Martin, are you leaving?!
- I absolutely gotta, kid.

09:27.612 --> 09:30.550
I got pressures on me, stuff
you wouldn't understand.

09:30.627 --> 09:32.083
But what about the villagers?!

09:32.160 --> 09:34.090
That ship looks like it's gonna blow up!

09:34.167 --> 09:36.456
Uhhhhh... maybe. I don't know.

09:36.533 --> 09:37.880
Maybe it <i> won't</i> blow up.

09:37.957 --> 09:41.228
I've seen 100 things weirder
than a ship not blowing up.

09:41.305 --> 09:42.679
Oh, dad!

09:42.799 --> 09:45.558
- I need to go shut it off!
- Okay, okay, wait! Wait.

09:45.635 --> 09:47.067
If you're gonna turn it off,

09:47.144 --> 09:48.542
you got to pull the heat-dump

09:48.619 --> 09:49.870
toggle in the engine core.

09:49.947 --> 09:53.674
It was too snug for me to get to, and
those little guys aren't strong enough.

09:53.875 --> 09:56.251
Hmm. Hey, I could wait for you.

09:56.328 --> 09:58.289
Maybe we could go into space together.

09:58.366 --> 10:01.254
Why didn't you tell me about
the heat dump in the first place?!

10:01.331 --> 10:03.225
I don't... know.

10:03.352 --> 10:05.743
- Wink.
- Daaaaaah!

10:06.621 --> 10:08.123
What the...

10:19.050 --> 10:20.632
Heat dump!

10:23.209 --> 10:26.546
Too... stuck!

10:26.623 --> 10:30.046
Ohhhh, no.
This is new to me.

10:30.123 --> 10:32.248
Mm...

10:51.540 --> 10:53.765
<i>Man, you know what's weird?</i>

10:53.868 --> 10:56.537
That wasn't even a comet
that crashed back there.

10:56.614 --> 10:59.185
So, then, what was that dream about?

10:59.262 --> 11:00.914
<i>I don't get my brain.</i>

11:01.612 --> 11:03.641
Okay, when we get back
to the tree house,

11:03.718 --> 11:04.980
let <i> me</i> do the talking.
