00:03.300 --> 00:05.689
(cork popping)

00:21.320 --> 00:24.710
(spray hissing)

00:39.500 --> 00:41.058
(panﬁng)

00:41.100 --> 00:43.739
Come here!
(grunts)

00:43.770 --> 00:45.169
(man grunting on TV)

00:45.210 --> 00:48.577
MAN (on TV):
On your knees, Burt.

00:48.610 --> 00:51.408
This is how the world ends.

00:51.450 --> 00:54.214
Someone begs, and someone

00:54.250 --> 00:56.218
stands over him with a gun.
(mutters)

00:56.250 --> 00:58.184
(gunshot)
(grunts)

00:58.220 --> 01:01.348
(birds squawking
and screeching)

01:01.390 --> 01:02.721
(applause)

01:02.760 --> 01:04.421
Welcome back to Talking at Noon.

01:04.460 --> 01:06.394
Wow, a rough episode.

01:06.430 --> 01:09.467
Now, we're gonna talk all things
Darkness at Noon in just a sec,

01:09.500 --> 01:11.559
but first, spoiler alert.

01:11.600 --> 01:13.431
Sam is dead, John was arrested,

01:13.470 --> 01:16.564
Linda gave birth,
Miguel did look at the flowers,

01:16.610 --> 01:19.704
and the yellow arm was moved.

01:19.740 --> 01:22.470
Badass stuff.
Your thoughts, Carmen?

01:22.510 --> 01:24.398
I was blown away. I mean...
Mm-hmm.
(doorbell rings)

01:24.450 --> 01:27.772
...every assumption
I had was turned upside down.

01:27.820 --> 01:29.185
Hi.

01:29.220 --> 01:30.778
Hi.

01:30.820 --> 01:32.617
Come on in.

01:34.820 --> 01:38.324
Would you like a glass
of wine? Red or white?

01:38.360 --> 01:39.759
No, I'm fine.

01:39.800 --> 01:42.325
Wow.

01:42.370 --> 01:43.792
You've really been
working overtime.

01:43.830 --> 01:46.799
Well, I didn't know
if you'd eaten.

01:46.840 --> 01:49.707
Maybe I will have
a glass of wine. Red.

02:02.450 --> 02:04.839
Nervous?

02:04.890 --> 02:06.289
Well, we're just talking, right?

02:06.320 --> 02:07.878
It doesn't mean anything.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.229
Right, right.
You can always say "no".

02:10.260 --> 02:12.592
(sighs)

02:12.630 --> 02:14.894
The election is in eight months,
the debates in six,

02:14.930 --> 02:16.727
and the candidate
announcement, Monday.

02:16.770 --> 02:19.238
This Monday?
Yes. That's the filing deadline.

02:19.270 --> 02:20.897
Eli, that's in four days.
Yes, but the good news is

02:20.940 --> 02:22.567
that we're ready to go.

02:22.610 --> 02:25.465
We have a plan in place, we've
done some initial polling.

02:25.510 --> 02:28.229
Alicia, things just
move faster now. They just do.

02:29.510 --> 02:31.239
You have the polling?

02:31.280 --> 02:34.738
Yes. If the election
were held today,

02:34.780 --> 02:37.886
and the only candidates
were you and Castro...

02:37.920 --> 02:40.650
you would win
by eight points.

02:40.690 --> 02:42.851
So you think it'll
just be me and Castro?

02:42.890 --> 02:44.448
Alicia, Alicia,
just wait a minute.

02:44.490 --> 02:45.923
You have
to hear these things first.

02:47.930 --> 02:50.569
You would win
by eight points.
Yes.

02:50.600 --> 02:52.295
That's good, right?
That's not just good.

02:52.340 --> 02:53.932
That's remarkable.
That kind of gap

02:53.970 --> 02:55.835
just doesn't exist
in Cook County.

02:55.870 --> 02:58.964
I just don't think it lasts.
Good news tends not to last.

02:59.010 --> 03:01.774
And that's what
I like about you.

03:01.810 --> 03:03.949
You're always looking
for the bad.

03:03.980 --> 03:06.847
But there are so many disasters
in a campaign

03:06.880 --> 03:09.678
that you have to acknowledge the
non-disasters when they happen.

03:09.720 --> 03:10.846
Good.

03:10.890 --> 03:12.915
But people don't really
know me yet.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.916
And Castro will try
to define me.
Yes.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.222
Before you define yourself.

03:16.260 --> 03:17.784
Go after the clients
I represent.

03:17.830 --> 03:19.821
Correct. You're a brand now.
Saint Alicia.

03:19.860 --> 03:21.327
Eli, I wish you would say that

03:21.360 --> 03:22.861
with at least a hint
of Irony.
No.

03:22.900 --> 03:24.868
Irony is dead now.
You're campaigning.

03:24.900 --> 03:26.788
JFK could be funny.
You can't.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.967
There's too many bloggers
out there quoting every

03:29.000 --> 03:31.002
ironic comment
as truth.
Okay.

03:31.040 --> 03:32.928
"Stop joking."
Good.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.971
Another part of your brand is
that you stood by your husband.

03:35.010 --> 03:37.274
Six years ago.
Yes, but that image
of you beside him

03:37.310 --> 03:38.777
is still bumping
around the Internet.

03:38.810 --> 03:40.869
You look better now.
People like that.

03:40.920 --> 03:42.888
You survived,
you prospered.

03:42.920 --> 03:45.388
You... didn't divorce.

03:45.420 --> 03:46.910
I know, but

03:46.960 --> 03:49.258
people don't need
to see the messiness.

03:49.290 --> 03:50.951
But Castro will make them
see the messmess.

03:50.990 --> 03:53.299
Yes, but he has to be careful,
or he'll look like a bully.

03:53.330 --> 03:54.854
He knows he can't go too far,

03:54.900 --> 03:57.698
'cause we have
some oppo research of our own.

03:57.730 --> 03:59.368
Such as?
Let's not

03:59.400 --> 04:01.595
get ahead of ourselves.
(doorbell rings)

04:01.640 --> 04:02.959
Oh, yeah, right.
I invited

04:03.010 --> 04:04.932
your campaign manager over
so you can meet him.

04:04.970 --> 04:08.508
What?! Wait. Eli,
you're my campaign manager.

04:08.540 --> 04:10.599
No, you need someone full-time.
I'm Peter's chief of staff.

04:10.650 --> 04:13.016
No, I can't. I'm... Uh...

04:13.050 --> 04:15.712
Who is it? I mean,
if I do decide to run?

04:15.750 --> 04:16.978
Johnny Elfman.
You'll like him.

04:17.020 --> 04:18.612
He's a top campaign op.

04:18.650 --> 04:19.981
He consulted
on the Obama 2012 win.

04:20.020 --> 04:21.851
He turned around Ohio.

04:21.890 --> 04:23.858
Eli, wait. No.
Okay, listen.
(doorbell rings)

04:23.890 --> 04:25.687
You know I said things move
faster now? That's this.

04:25.730 --> 04:26.992
Talk to him, meet him,
question him.

04:27.030 --> 04:29.021
This is his job interview.

04:29.060 --> 04:30.823
If you don't like him, just
pull me aside after 20 minutes,

04:30.870 --> 04:32.337
and say he's not for you,
and we'll keep looking.

04:32.370 --> 04:33.997
20 minutes?
Mm-hmm.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.393
(knocking)

04:35.440 --> 04:36.964
I have to answer
the dﬁor now.
0.

04:37.010 --> 04:38.659
I will.

04:43.350 --> 04:46.740
Hi. I'm Alicia Florrick.

04:46.780 --> 04:49.044
Uh, Johnny Elfman.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.480
Can I get you some wine,
Mr. ﬁfman?
o.

04:51.520 --> 04:52.987
Thank you. I'm fine.
Is-is Eli...?

04:53.020 --> 04:54.988
Here, Johnny.
Eli,

04:55.020 --> 04:57.557
do you have a second? Would you
excuse us, Mrs. Florrick?

05:01.960 --> 05:03.564
Eli.
(door closes)

05:03.600 --> 05:05.465
What the hell?
You said
you'd listen to her.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.991
No, I said I'd listen to you. I
thought this was your apartment.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.098
Well, you're here now.
Just listen to her.

05:09.140 --> 05:10.732
If you don't like her,
in 20 minutes,

05:10.770 --> 05:12.977
just pull me aside,
and say "No, thanks."

05:13.010 --> 05:14.773
MAN: I hate her.
WOMAN: The wife? Why? She's just
trying to protect him.

05:14.810 --> 05:16.107
Because she took his guns.
She wants him

05:16.140 --> 05:19.075
not to be normal,
not a badass...
I just think

05:19.110 --> 05:20.919
she's so repressed, she had
to do something like this.

05:20.950 --> 05:23.646
MAN: Oh, she's definitely
repressed, but...

05:23.690 --> 05:25.817
This is so disrespectful.
You're trying to get me pregnant

05:25.850 --> 05:27.056
with her.
I knew you'd just
say "no"

05:27.090 --> 05:28.580
if you didn't meet her.
She's a first-timer.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.759
I'm finished with first-timers.

05:30.790 --> 05:31.950
They-they have lives.
They have...
Hi.

05:31.990 --> 05:33.423
Mr. Gold, hey.

05:33.460 --> 05:36.361
Is my mom here?
Hi, Grace. Yes.

05:36.400 --> 05:39.995
(indistinct, overlapping
chatter, music playing)

05:44.410 --> 05:46.799
They have kids.

05:46.840 --> 05:49.707
What's going on?
I have school
choir tonight.

05:49.750 --> 05:53.140
I told you.
Okay, um, I need you
to do it in your room, okay?

05:53.180 --> 05:55.944
Okay. Love you.

05:55.980 --> 05:58.141
Everything all right, gentlemen?

05:58.190 --> 06:00.784
Should we do this another time?
No. John just

06:00.820 --> 06:02.651
had some questions,
but now they're answered, right?

06:05.090 --> 06:06.751
Yeah.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.564
The plan is a speech on the
steps of the courthouse,

06:09.600 --> 06:11.090
the governor
introducing you,

06:11.130 --> 06:13.030
then you speaking for five
minutes introducing yourself.

06:13.070 --> 06:15.391
Isn't it a mistake
to use Peter?

06:15.440 --> 06:17.806
Won't it look like
I'm in his shadow?
No. The only way your story...

06:17.840 --> 06:21.606
GIRLS:
* I will trust in the Lord,
I will trust in the Lord *

06:21.640 --> 06:23.107
* I will trust in the Lord...

06:23.150 --> 06:25.175
The only way your story gets
traction is a good visual.

06:25.210 --> 06:28.043
They'll show the old shot of you
standing by Peter in disgrace.

06:28.080 --> 06:31.117
Then this new shot of Peter
standing by you in triumph.

06:31.150 --> 06:32.879
That's the story.

06:32.920 --> 06:34.751
What do you think, Mr. Elfman?

06:34.790 --> 06:36.018
About?

06:36.060 --> 06:37.652
About what Eli just said.

06:37.690 --> 06:40.158
Uh, I'm reserving judgment.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.952
It_ doesn't seem like there's
time to reserve judgment.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.993
And yet here I
am, reserving it.

06:46.030 --> 06:49.932
Aanay, our first strategic move
is embracing the governor.

06:49.970 --> 06:53.178
Peter brings in the big bucks,
and also reminds voters

06:53.210 --> 06:54.905
of your constancy...
Why do you want
to run, Mrs. Florrick?

06:54.940 --> 06:57.101
Excuse me?

06:57.150 --> 06:59.618
Why do you want to run for
state's attorney, Mrs. Florrick?
Because

06:59.650 --> 07:02.539
the current state's attorney
is using the office politically.

07:02.590 --> 07:05.150
And how is he doing that?
He's prosecuting people,
not because they've done

07:05.190 --> 07:06.851
anything wrong, but because
he doesn't like them,

07:06.890 --> 07:08.881
or he doesn't like the people
associated with them.

07:08.920 --> 07:11.889
And how would you...?
I'm not finished yet.
Do you want me to finish?

07:11.930 --> 07:14.194
There has been more

07:14.230 --> 07:16.050
corruption in the current
state's attorney's office

07:16.100 --> 07:18.591
than at any point since...

07:18.630 --> 07:20.791
Since your husband?

07:22.540 --> 07:25.566
Do you have an issue with me,
Mr. Elfman?

07:25.610 --> 07:28.170
I don't even
know you, ma'am.

07:28.210 --> 07:30.440
Do you have an issue
with my running?

07:33.620 --> 07:35.941
There is always a point
during the campaign where

07:35.980 --> 07:37.186
I'm not proud of myself.

07:37.220 --> 07:38.847
Where I've lied to a reporter,

07:38.890 --> 07:40.187
_ or smeared
an Innocent bystander,

07:40.220 --> 07:42.188
or badgered a friend
into giving money.

07:42.220 --> 07:44.620
But I do it willingly because
I believe in the candidate,

07:44.660 --> 07:47.220
Mrs. Florrick, so, yes,
I have an issue with you

07:47.260 --> 07:48.955
or anyone who considers running.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.059
Are you up to it? Because
I'm not some dilettante...

07:51.100 --> 07:52.897
Neither am I.
I build my life
on winning.

07:52.940 --> 07:56.603
On hating the enemy
and loving my candidate.

07:56.640 --> 07:58.039
(phone ringing)

07:58.070 --> 08:00.106
GRACE:
I've got it.

08:01.780 --> 08:04.999
I'm not your superhero,

08:05.050 --> 08:08.019
Mr. Elfman. You want to go find
someone to restore your faith

08:08.050 --> 08:11.110
in humanity,
don't waste my time, or yours.

08:11.150 --> 08:14.051
GRACE:
Mom, it's for you.
It's work.

08:14.090 --> 08:16.627
It was nice to meet you,
Mr. Elfman.

08:16.660 --> 08:18.287
Well?

08:18.330 --> 08:21.197
What's up? 1-1 don't understand.
What happened?

08:21.230 --> 08:22.629
CARY:
It's Bishop. He got a subpoena.

08:22.670 --> 08:24.092
For what?

08:24.130 --> 08:26.189
All records associated
with his real estate holdings.

08:26.230 --> 08:27.959
Well, that's good.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.865
There's nothing wrong
with his real estate holdings.

08:29.910 --> 08:32.003
Right, which is why we comply
with the subpoena.

08:32.040 --> 08:33.530
Bishop is our client...

08:33.580 --> 08:35.707
They're not after Bishop.
They're after me.

08:35.740 --> 08:37.241
We don't know that.

08:37.280 --> 08:39.669
And it doesn't matter.
It doe matter.

08:39.720 --> 08:42.143
Wait! Bishop's innocent, right?

08:42.180 --> 08:43.647
Of the real estate charge, yes.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.043
They say he failed to
pay real estate taxes

08:45.090 --> 08:46.318
on property used for
commercial purposes.

08:46.350 --> 08:48.557
Okay, then we comply.

08:48.590 --> 08:50.581
There's nothing there,
so we should

08:50.630 --> 08:52.188
show the state's attorney
there's nothing there.

08:52.230 --> 08:54.653
(doorbell rings)
CARY: Alicia, they only
want us to comply,

08:54.700 --> 08:56.053
so they can use that precedent

08:56.100 --> 08:57.727
in front of a judge
in my criminal case.

08:57.770 --> 08:59.761
It's the camel nose
under the tent.

08:59.800 --> 09:02.166
Hi.

09:02.200 --> 09:03.565
Grace sent up the bat signal.

09:03.610 --> 09:05.100
Sure. In her room.

09:05.140 --> 09:06.676
ELI:
You're saying every housewife
is the same.

09:06.710 --> 09:08.177
That's not_ what
I'm saying.
Come on!

09:08.210 --> 09:10.644
(classical music playing)

09:12.210 --> 09:14.610
Who-who was that?

09:14.650 --> 09:17.084
I have no idea.
It's like a_Marx Brothers
mowe In here.

09:17.120 --> 09:19.247
It doesn't matter, Cary!
He's our client.

09:19.290 --> 09:20.780
We can't favor you over him,
or him over you.

09:20.820 --> 09:22.185
See? See?
Tough cookie.

09:22.220 --> 09:23.858
(phone ringing)

09:23.890 --> 09:26.029
Hi. No, it's
going very well.

09:26.060 --> 09:27.254
Yes.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.598
No, 1-1 haven't shown that
to her yet.

09:29.630 --> 09:32.019
You_h_aven't shown her the
oppOSItlon research? Why not?

09:32.070 --> 09:33.935
Because you don't start
with the dirt.

09:33.970 --> 09:36.632
You end with it.
Same thing I did with you.

09:36.670 --> 09:38.035
How dirty is it?

09:38.070 --> 09:39.264
I can't tell you that, Peter.

09:39.310 --> 09:40.868
This is for Alicia, not you.

09:40.910 --> 09:42.332
(sighs)
Anything about me in there?

09:42.380 --> 09:44.041
We can't do this, Peter.

09:44.080 --> 09:45.945
I'm not her campaign manager.
Talk to him.

09:45.980 --> 09:47.709
Oh, uh, who'd you get,
by the way?

09:47.750 --> 09:49.217
Uh, Johnny Elfman.

09:49.250 --> 09:51.616
Johnny Elfman?

09:51.650 --> 09:53.288
I thought he was in Ohio.

09:53.320 --> 09:55.311
He was in Ohio, but he wanted
to broaden his scope.

09:55.360 --> 09:57.157
To a state's attorney's race?

09:57.190 --> 09:58.350
Well, to this
state's attorney's race.

09:58.390 --> 09:59.948
(chatter, laughter,
music playing)

10:00.000 --> 10:01.695
How's he looking these days?

10:01.730 --> 10:04.062
Uh, Elfman?
What do you mean?

10:04.100 --> 10:05.863
Oh, I heard he was
in a motorcycle accident.

10:05.900 --> 10:08.130
Scar on his face
or something like that.

10:08.170 --> 10:10.309
I can't see anything.
Uh, I got to go.
PETER: Uh, listen,

10:10.340 --> 10:11.807
I want to be kept
in the loop on this.

10:11.840 --> 10:13.307
I understand.
JOHNNY:
Yes, but all

10:13.340 --> 10:15.877
of your rationales for running
were negative. They were all

10:15.910 --> 10:18.640
about what the current state's
attorney's donng wrong.
That's because he...

10:18.680 --> 10:20.341
Yes, but you need to find a
positive reason for running.

10:20.380 --> 10:21.972
Give me an example.

10:22.020 --> 10:24.648
Why did you
get into law?

10:24.690 --> 10:26.214
I like clarity.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.309
I like rules that tell me
what's right and wrong.

10:28.360 --> 10:31.386
And you wanted to help
people with those rules?
No.

10:31.430 --> 10:34.228
I know I'm supposed to
say "yes," but I just

10:34.260 --> 10:37.024
wanted to be inside something
that made sense to me.

10:37.070 --> 10:39.391
I never thought about...

10:39.430 --> 10:41.762
People?
Yeah.

10:41.800 --> 10:44.234
Maybe don't put that
in the stump speech.

10:44.270 --> 10:47.376
Okay.

10:47.410 --> 10:48.900
"Okay" what?

10:48.940 --> 10:50.407
Okay, Johnny needs to take you

10:50.450 --> 10:52.008
through the opposition research.

10:52.050 --> 10:54.245
The research of Castro?

10:54.280 --> 10:55.349
Uh, no, of you.

10:55.380 --> 10:57.883
The skeletons in my closet?

10:57.920 --> 11:00.252
Yes.

11:00.290 --> 11:01.712
That's a lot of skeletons.

11:01.760 --> 11:03.751
You ever seen The Matrix?

11:03.790 --> 11:05.826
Yes.
Remember when
they show Keanu

11:05.860 --> 11:08.852
a red pill and a blue one,
and if he takes the red pill,

11:08.900 --> 11:10.322
he'll keep going down
the rabbit hole?

11:10.370 --> 11:11.826
Yeah.

11:11.870 --> 11:14.031
This is the red pill.

11:15.300 --> 11:17.768
What's the blue pill?

11:17.810 --> 11:19.402
You tell us you don't
want to run.

11:26.350 --> 11:28.341
Let's go.

11:46.330 --> 11:48.332
(papers rustling)

11:55.510 --> 11:56.943
Your clients.

11:56.980 --> 11:58.402
I know. Colin Sweeney
and Lemond Bishop.

11:58.450 --> 12:00.475
And the Paisley Group.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.408
Why the Paisley Group?
Mr. Paisley spoke out on Israel.

12:02.450 --> 12:05.112
_ And that matters
In a state's attorney's race?

12:05.150 --> 12:07.459
Israel matters in every race.
But won't it look
opportunistic

12:07.490 --> 12:09.378
if I just drop them as clients?

12:09.420 --> 12:11.251
Yes. Which is why you
only drop Bishop.

12:11.290 --> 12:12.928
He's the one that
hurts you the most and

12:12.960 --> 12:14.222
there's reason to
drop him. The firm's

12:14.260 --> 12:15.454
representation of
your law partner

12:15.500 --> 12:17.866
means you're
conflicted out, right?

12:17.900 --> 12:19.788
Right.
Good. So we need that to happen

12:19.840 --> 12:21.034
before the
announcement.

12:21.070 --> 12:22.389
I'll meet with him
tomorrow.

12:22.440 --> 12:26.160
Okay, good.
Now, your son, Zach.

12:26.210 --> 12:28.201
He got his girlfriend,
Nisa Dalmar,

12:28.240 --> 12:30.242
pregnant last year and
they had an abortion.

12:30.280 --> 12:32.475
Now, there's nothing
much to be done about it

12:32.510 --> 12:34.011
as a campaign issue,
but you should

12:34.050 --> 12:35.472
be prepared for questions.

12:35.520 --> 12:37.181
Mostly because when
the abortion happened

12:37.220 --> 12:38.949
he was 17 and
she was 16,

12:38.990 --> 12:40.412
and because she's Muslim.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.314
Alicia, we don't want
to bring these things up,

12:42.360 --> 12:43.952
but we're
just afraid you're

12:43.990 --> 12:46.026
gonna be sandbagged
during the campaign.

12:46.060 --> 12:47.857
It's the working
mother question.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.458
Were your children
unsupervised

12:49.500 --> 12:51.525
while you were at work?
It's sexist, I know, but

12:51.570 --> 12:53.538
you may get hit with that
from the conservative press.

12:53.570 --> 12:55.834
You're...
How do you know this?

12:55.870 --> 12:57.838
Is this a-a campaign smear?

12:57.870 --> 13:01.328
Yes, but we can't deny
it, unfortunately.

13:01.380 --> 13:03.109
Why?

13:03.150 --> 13:04.447
Because it happened.

13:04.480 --> 13:07.278
VVhen?

13:07.320 --> 13:09.276
Last year.

13:09.320 --> 13:11.311
August.

13:17.390 --> 13:19.085
What day?

13:20.500 --> 13:22.149
August 5.

13:22.200 --> 13:23.929
How do you know?
We have a record

13:23.970 --> 13:25.323
from the abortion clinic.

13:28.170 --> 13:30.229
Do you know
how many months pregnant?

13:30.270 --> 13:32.261
No.

13:36.510 --> 13:39.308
She was 16. She was a minor?
Yes.

13:39.350 --> 13:40.612
Did they have the abortion
in Illinois?

13:40.650 --> 13:42.413
JOHNNY:
Yes.

13:42.450 --> 13:44.486
The parents of a minor have
to be notified in Illinois.

13:44.520 --> 13:45.987
Yes, and they were.

13:51.190 --> 13:52.452
I know this is hard,

13:52.490 --> 13:54.458
Mrs. Florrick, but
everything that you're

13:54.500 --> 13:56.923
feeling now will be used
against you later.

13:56.970 --> 13:59.427
So it's important
to inure yourself.

14:02.440 --> 14:05.409
I'm sorry. Tell me
when you're ready to move on.

14:05.440 --> 14:07.431
I'm sorry, I need
to make a phone call.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.402
Alicia, you can't.
I'll be
right back.

14:09.440 --> 14:11.943
Are you calling your son?
That's none of your business.

14:11.980 --> 14:13.470
If you get his voice mail,
you can't leave a message--

14:13.520 --> 14:15.215
nothing specific--
it can be used against you.

14:19.220 --> 14:20.881
PETER:
Hey. What's up?

14:20.920 --> 14:23.320
Our son had an abortion.
Did you know that?

14:24.560 --> 14:26.289
What?

14:26.330 --> 14:28.958
Did Zach tell you he had
an abortion? On August 5.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.093
When he was supposed to be
touring colleges in Boston.

14:31.130 --> 14:32.392
Wait,

14:32.430 --> 14:33.931
where are you hearing this from?

14:33.970 --> 14:36.438
Opposition research.
What do you think?

14:36.470 --> 14:37.539
(soft sigh)

14:37.570 --> 14:39.504
Uh, no, no, he never
said anything.

14:39.540 --> 14:41.337
We're cutting him off without
a cent, you know that.

14:41.380 --> 14:43.507
He can buy his own
frigging way though college.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.302
Or get Nisa's parents to do it.

14:45.350 --> 14:47.511
Nisa? Not Becca?

14:47.550 --> 14:50.041
August 5. Nisa.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.443
Every time
he's been lying to me.

14:51.490 --> 14:53.048
"It's all in your head, Mom.

14:53.090 --> 14:54.614
"I don't smoke pot, Mom.

14:54.660 --> 14:57.083
I'm a good boy."
Well, let's see how he deals.

14:57.130 --> 14:59.086
All right, Alicia, listen to me.

14:59.130 --> 15:01.018
Don't you dare
tell me to calm down.

15:01.060 --> 15:02.391
He lied to me.

15:02.430 --> 15:03.692
I know, I'm sorry.

15:03.730 --> 15:05.493
But I want you to let me
talk to him.
No.

15:05.530 --> 15:07.964
This one's mine.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.366
(dials phone)

15:10.410 --> 15:13.470
(line ringing)

15:13.510 --> 15:15.205
ZACH:
You've reached Zach's
voice mail. I'm in class

15:15.240 --> 15:16.434
right now or sleeping it off.

15:16.480 --> 15:17.549
Leave a message.
(beep)

15:17.580 --> 15:19.969
Zach...

15:20.020 --> 15:22.045
it's Mom.

15:22.080 --> 15:24.082
Call me back.

15:29.390 --> 15:31.381
(eagle cries)

15:38.370 --> 15:40.338
You have kids?

15:40.370 --> 15:41.564
No.

15:41.600 --> 15:43.704
No time.
TOM:
So what does the elk

15:43.740 --> 15:46.038
symbolize?
Oh, easy-- the soul
of Michael,

15:46.070 --> 15:48.004
rising from the dead,
reincarnated.

15:48.040 --> 15:50.747
(phone rings)
His master's voice.

15:50.780 --> 15:52.543
Mr. Governor. Good evening.

15:52.580 --> 15:54.616
You told Alicia
that Zach got an abortion?

15:55.720 --> 15:56.744
Yes.

15:56.780 --> 15:59.442
Why?

15:59.490 --> 16:00.479
Because he did.
Eli,

16:00.520 --> 16:02.010
this is becoming...

16:02.060 --> 16:03.482
Yes?

16:04.590 --> 16:06.023
Are you gonna
bring up the intern?

16:06.060 --> 16:07.527
I can't tell you that,
Mr. Governor.

16:07.560 --> 16:08.652
Eli,

16:08.700 --> 16:10.361
I'm not sleeping with her.

16:10.400 --> 16:11.992
I understand that,
but oppo research is not

16:12.030 --> 16:13.338
just about what's true.
It's about

16:13.370 --> 16:14.496
where we're vulnerable.
Listen, Ell,

16:14.540 --> 16:15.598
you bring her up,

16:15.640 --> 16:17.505
and it becomes a thing.

16:20.140 --> 16:21.778
I will deal with this here.
Lauren will not

16:21.810 --> 16:23.505
be an issue in Alicia's
campaign, okay?

16:23.550 --> 16:25.347
I'll talk to you,
Mr. Governor.

16:25.380 --> 16:26.506
Peter?

16:26.550 --> 16:28.177
Asking how you knew about Zach?

16:28.220 --> 16:30.040
Yeah.

16:31.590 --> 16:33.558
You, uh, sure you want
to continue, Mrs. Florrick?

16:33.590 --> 16:34.682
We can stop right here.

16:34.720 --> 16:37.518
Why? Let's do it. I'm inured.

16:40.160 --> 16:42.458
Okay. (clears throat)
Well, there are some issues

16:42.500 --> 16:44.798
with your brother
and your mom.

16:44.830 --> 16:47.037
(laughs)
Of course there are.

16:47.070 --> 16:48.537
Gay support--

16:48.570 --> 16:50.037
especially
financial support--

16:50.070 --> 16:51.469
it matters _
to your campaign.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.478
That's why your brother's
actions matter.

16:53.510 --> 16:55.137
What'd he do?
Well, he's been

16:55.180 --> 16:56.374
having an affair
with a married

16:56.410 --> 16:58.469
Palestinian man who also does

16:58.510 --> 17:00.319
barebacked gay porn

17:00.350 --> 17:02.079
under the name Phil.

17:07.520 --> 17:09.750
I don't know hoIiév to answer that.
s

17:09.790 --> 17:12.520
the affair with a married man
that's the most problematic.
Well, that and the

17:12.560 --> 17:15.620
barebacked gay porn.
Yeah, and the porn. Yeah.

17:15.660 --> 17:18.220
These issues tend to
create a division within

17:18.270 --> 17:20.397
the gay community.
GIRLS:
* I will trust in the Lord

17:20.440 --> 17:23.261
_* I will trust
in the Lord *

17:23.310 --> 17:25.505
So you want me
to break up

17:25.540 --> 17:28.134
the affair with the Palestinian?
No. It's just

17:28.180 --> 17:31.570
Owen has a tendency to talk. And
Castro will have video trackers.

17:31.610 --> 17:34.443
ZACH:
It's Boston College, Mom.
I have to go see it.

17:34.480 --> 17:36.539
Really, it means a lot to me.
JOHNNY:
The story could get pinned

17:36.580 --> 17:39.344
to any visual--
pixilated gay porn...

17:39.390 --> 17:41.585
We need him to lay low
for a little while.

17:41.620 --> 17:44.680
* I will trust in the Lord

17:44.730 --> 17:46.425
Okay.

17:46.460 --> 17:49.623
Talk to Zach and Owen.

17:49.660 --> 17:52.163
Now, Mom.

17:52.200 --> 17:53.531
What about Mom?

17:53.570 --> 17:54.639
(clears throat)

17:54.670 --> 17:56.763
She hit a child
in a department store.

17:57.810 --> 17:59.209
What?

17:59.240 --> 18:00.878
A five-year-old
child, uh,

18:00.910 --> 18:03.549
Greg Weymouth. Veronica
took him over her knee

18:03.580 --> 18:06.640
and, uh... spanked him.

18:06.680 --> 18:08.671
Why would she do that?

18:08.720 --> 18:10.415
I don't know.
But there's videotape.

18:10.450 --> 18:13.180
There's videotape
of her hitting a child?

18:13.220 --> 18:14.551
We just need her
to apologize

18:14.590 --> 18:16.455
to the family.
Fend off any possible suits.

18:16.490 --> 18:19.186
Okay.

18:19.230 --> 18:22.597
Talk to Mom about
hitting children.

18:22.630 --> 18:24.564
Next.

18:24.600 --> 18:26.761
What about Grace?
What did she do?

18:26.800 --> 18:29.360
Turning tricks after school?

18:29.400 --> 18:30.765
Well, actually...

18:32.170 --> 18:33.569
No, that was a joke.
(laughs)

18:33.610 --> 18:35.373
Grace is good.

18:35.410 --> 18:38.208
Christianity 3, atheism 0.
Uh, yes,

18:38.250 --> 18:39.569
talking of atheism...

18:39.610 --> 18:41.714
I know.
If you need
to talk about religion--

18:41.750 --> 18:42.774
and you shouldn't
talk about religion--

18:42.820 --> 18:44.708
just say you're
struggling.

18:44.750 --> 18:46.615
Just say you're an agnostic

18:46.650 --> 18:47.617
who's struggling.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.651
Right, I'll get on that.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.479
Anything else?

18:52.530 --> 18:54.725
_* I will trust
in the Lord *

18:54.760 --> 18:56.591
* I will trust in the Lord

18:56.630 --> 18:59.497
Well, now it's time to turn
to you, Mrs. Florrick.

18:59.530 --> 19:00.633
Your issues.

19:00.670 --> 19:01.659
Can't wait.

19:04.540 --> 19:06.735
Yes. This is a photo
of me with

19:06.770 --> 19:08.670
my boss, Will Gardner,
at a hotel reception desk

19:08.710 --> 19:10.371
researching a case.
A rape case.

19:10.410 --> 19:12.207
Can you substantiate that?

19:12.250 --> 19:14.844
Well, Will's dead.
So not from him.

19:14.880 --> 19:17.383
But I'm sure you can
from the clerk there.
Do you

19:17.420 --> 19:19.786
remember her name?
It was five years ago.
But I can look back in my files.

19:19.820 --> 19:22.618
That would be good,
thank you. And...

19:22.660 --> 19:24.355
how about this?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.558
Isn't it lovely

19:29.600 --> 19:32.569
how your whole life
gets documented?

19:32.600 --> 19:35.933
I lived for 13 years in Highland
Park in complete obscurity.

19:35.970 --> 19:39.428
Going to lunches
with my tennis friends,

19:39.470 --> 19:40.971
picking up the kids from school,

19:41.010 --> 19:43.899
drinking a glass
of wine at 5:00.

19:43.950 --> 19:45.645
And no one cared.

19:45.680 --> 19:48.843
No one bothered
to look in on me.

19:48.880 --> 19:51.644
Now people care.

19:51.690 --> 19:54.511
It almost gives you
a warm feeling.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.289
Castro intends to use this.
Use what?

19:56.320 --> 19:57.981
That photo?
The time stamp reads

19:58.030 --> 20:00.498
8:27 a.m., and Mr. Polmar
is leaving your apartment.

20:00.530 --> 20:01.997
Yes, well,
I don't like

20:02.030 --> 20:03.895
my kids seeing who I sleep with.

20:03.930 --> 20:06.922
How could they get out
in time for their abortions?
Okay,

20:06.970 --> 20:09.837
remember what I said
about irony during campaigns?
I was taking

20:09.870 --> 20:12.304
Finn through his testimony
that morning

20:12.340 --> 20:15.002
for his S.A.
disciplinary panel.
And he'll back you up on this?

20:15.040 --> 20:17.508
It's the truth.
It's our understanding,
Mrs. Florrick,

20:17.550 --> 20:19.279
that he's prosecuting
your law partner,

20:19.310 --> 20:20.777
and that you
have fought...

20:20.820 --> 20:22.549
In court.
And that he was asked

20:22.580 --> 20:25.378
to run and then forced to quit
before you decided to run.

20:28.820 --> 20:32.028
What's that?
Talk to Zach,
Owen, Mom and

20:32.060 --> 20:34.528
Finn Polmar. See if any of them
plan to screw me over.

20:34.560 --> 20:35.993
And Lemond Bishop.
Right.

20:36.030 --> 20:39.022
And fire him as a client.
Anything else?

20:39.070 --> 20:40.469
Yes. The governor has a few...
That's okay, John.

20:40.500 --> 20:43.264
That-That's enough for now.

20:44.070 --> 20:45.935
No, what is it?
We just want to do

20:45.970 --> 20:48.302
a little more digging before
we present you with this.

20:48.340 --> 20:50.570
If it's about Peter,
I'm ready.

20:50.610 --> 20:52.271
It's okay.

20:53.350 --> 20:54.840
Is it about Kalinda?

20:56.950 --> 20:59.714
What?
Is_ it about Kalinda's
one-night stand With Peter?

20:59.750 --> 21:01.058
Because I know
about that already.

21:01.090 --> 21:02.318
Uh, who's Kalinda?

21:02.360 --> 21:03.486
She's an investigator

21:03.530 --> 21:05.054
who used to work
in the S.A.'s office.

21:05.090 --> 21:06.626
She slept with my husband.

21:06.660 --> 21:07.957
Now she works at my firm.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.991
Do we have that one?

21:10.030 --> 21:11.793
We'll look into it.
Kalinda won't talk,

21:11.830 --> 21:13.639
but if you're worried about
what might complicate

21:13.670 --> 21:16.867
my campaign...
Let us do our job.
I'll look into it, okay?

21:18.510 --> 21:20.978
Okay.

21:21.010 --> 21:22.932
Well, this was fun.

21:22.980 --> 21:25.847
You've passed basic training,
Mrs. Florrick.

21:25.880 --> 21:27.074
Are you running?

21:27.110 --> 21:28.771
I don't know.

21:28.820 --> 21:30.071
I'm still contemplating.

21:30.120 --> 21:32.338
You have till Monday to decide.

21:34.090 --> 21:36.684
If it's any consolation,
Mrs. Florrick, uh...

21:36.720 --> 21:37.982
Alicia.

21:38.030 --> 21:40.351
Anyone who's pawed
through my undenNear drawer

21:40.400 --> 21:42.095
should really call me
by my first name.

21:42.130 --> 21:45.327
Alicia. I've sat
through 18 of these

21:45.370 --> 21:47.361
"Come to Jesus" moments
with candidates, and

21:47.400 --> 21:48.936
you've handled it the best.

21:48.970 --> 21:51.438
Great. Thank you.

21:51.470 --> 21:53.973
Nice meeting you,
Mrs. Florrick.

21:54.010 --> 21:56.501
You, too, Mr. Elfman.

21:56.540 --> 21:59.338
TOM: There are so many
badasses in this show.

21:59.380 --> 22:01.610
JOE: What?
TOM: You got Sam,
Michael, Gifford...

22:01.650 --> 22:04.118
There's only one badass.
CARMEN:
No, no, no, no.

22:04.150 --> 22:06.414
He thinks he's a badass. You
know who's really the badass?
Oh, my God.

22:06.450 --> 22:07.917
Whoa, whoa, whoa. And
isn't the whole point

22:07.960 --> 22:10.383
that the-the badass
is the guy with the gun?

22:10.430 --> 22:11.727
CARMEN:
Big badass. Capital...

22:18.500 --> 22:20.365
Hi.

22:20.400 --> 22:21.936
Hello.

22:21.970 --> 22:22.629
What's up?

22:22.670 --> 22:24.501
We've received your subpoena.

22:24.540 --> 22:26.462
The subpoena
for your real estate holdings.

22:26.510 --> 22:29.479
We believe it's a good idea
to comply with this subpoena.

22:29.510 --> 22:31.899
BISHOP:
Good. I would agree.

22:31.950 --> 22:34.077
We've done nothing wrong.
DIANE:
That's right. But,

22:34.120 --> 22:37.146
um, we have run into
a bit of a problem.

22:37.180 --> 22:38.943
What problem?

22:40.020 --> 22:42.818
We can't represent you anymore.

22:44.160 --> 22:45.821
Why not?
I think I'd
better leave

22:45.860 --> 22:48.499
for this discussion.

22:53.100 --> 22:54.988
(door shuts)
We represent Cary.

22:55.040 --> 22:58.407
He's being prosecuted because
of his relationship with you,

22:58.440 --> 23:01.807
and we're having difficulty
representing both of you.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.501
Why is that?

23:04.710 --> 23:07.508
Well...
We believe
that this...

23:07.550 --> 23:09.472
real estate attack by the SA.

23:09.520 --> 23:12.045
is purely a Trojan horse
to get at Cary.

23:12.090 --> 23:13.819
I don't understand.
Well,

23:13.860 --> 23:15.987
if we comply
with the SA. subpoena,

23:16.020 --> 23:18.580
we think they intend
to use that compliance

23:18.630 --> 23:21.053
as a precedent in Cary's case.
That's why

23:21.100 --> 23:23.056
we're suggesting
you change representation.

23:23.100 --> 23:26.467
This is a list
of five firms that we recommend.

23:26.500 --> 23:29.936
And they are all willing--
no, excited--

23:29.970 --> 23:32.632
to take you on. And we can get
you on the phone with them.

23:34.080 --> 23:37.208
DIANE:
Uh, Mr. Bishop,
it's best for your business

23:37.240 --> 23:38.878
that you work with another firm.

23:41.650 --> 23:42.969
No.

23:45.250 --> 23:48.219
The problem is, Mr. Bishop,
the state's attorney

23:48.260 --> 23:52.128
is taking advantage
of our conflict of interests.

23:52.160 --> 23:54.128
We need you
to consider another firm.

23:54.160 --> 23:56.958
No. But thank you.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.025
Is there anything else?

23:59.070 --> 24:01.493
Mr. Bishop,

24:01.540 --> 24:03.701
I'm gonna have to go
to the judge to remove myself.

24:03.740 --> 24:05.162
Do it.

24:05.210 --> 24:07.508
I'll say I need you
as my attorney.

24:07.540 --> 24:10.646
Who do you think
the judge will listen to?

24:16.580 --> 24:19.981
Yes?

24:20.020 --> 24:21.658
Did you want
to ask me something?

24:21.690 --> 24:22.850
Did you sleep with Peter?

24:24.690 --> 24:27.591
That's why we're meeting here
and not in your office?

24:27.630 --> 24:29.154
Now I understand _
why there was so much ten5ion

24:29.200 --> 24:30.622
between you and Peter.

24:32.530 --> 24:33.531
Did Alicia say...?

24:33.570 --> 24:34.832
No.

24:34.870 --> 24:38.601
Did Peter say...?
No.

24:38.640 --> 24:41.871
Why are you asking?
Alicia's running for state's
attorney. I need to know

24:41.910 --> 24:45.209
where my land
mines are.

24:45.250 --> 24:48.913
Well, this is not a land mine.
Really?

24:48.950 --> 24:51.248
Peter Florrick sleeps with you
while you're working at the
state's attorney's office.

24:51.290 --> 24:53.679
Then he sleeps with
prostitutes, while you
become Alicia's best friend.

24:53.720 --> 24:55.881
Well, not best friend.
Uh, out

24:55.920 --> 24:58.229
of all those things I just said,
you find objectionable

24:58.260 --> 24:59.989
the best friend charge?

25:01.200 --> 25:04.692
So you slept
with him?

25:04.730 --> 25:08.598
Eli, let me put this to you
another way.

25:08.640 --> 25:11.700
You have nothing to worry about.
Kalinda,

25:11.740 --> 25:14.004
I treat you with respect
because I know that you know

25:14.040 --> 25:16.634
what my job entails.
There is nothing

25:16.680 --> 25:19.240
that will bite me
in the ass here?
Nothing.

25:19.280 --> 25:20.611
Unless you ask me again,

25:20.650 --> 25:22.242
_ there
is nothing.
Believe me,

25:22.280 --> 25:24.817
this is the last lunch
I wanted to have.
Good.

25:24.850 --> 25:27.978
Then we're okay.

25:28.020 --> 25:30.625
So now we have
to wait for lunch?

25:30.660 --> 25:32.651
Or we could just go.

25:32.690 --> 25:34.794
Without ordering or paying?

25:34.830 --> 25:36.695
Yeah.

25:43.710 --> 25:46.634
VERONICA:
You don't think it's weird
that she invited us both

25:46.670 --> 25:48.672
to her apartment
at the same time?

25:48.710 --> 25:50.598
She wants something.

25:52.310 --> 25:54.016
She wants me to be
the godfather.

25:54.050 --> 25:56.109
God, what a frightening
thought that would be.

25:56.150 --> 25:57.788
No, she wants
money or something.

25:57.820 --> 25:59.708
Wait, why is that
a frightening thought?

25:59.750 --> 26:01.251
Oh. Yay.

26:01.290 --> 26:02.609
Here we all are,

26:02.660 --> 26:04.878
together.

26:04.930 --> 26:06.579
Family.
It's good to see you both.

26:06.630 --> 26:07.949
Have you read
The Goldfinch?

26:08.000 --> 26:10.059
It's such
beautiful writing.

26:10.100 --> 26:12.660
It's all
about art and life.

26:12.700 --> 26:14.736
So, you're probably wondering

26:14.770 --> 26:16.738
why I needed
to meet with you...
No...

26:16.770 --> 26:18.203
I'm thinking of running
for state's attorney.

26:18.240 --> 26:21.801
And I needed
to talk to you

26:21.840 --> 26:24.775
about a few dos and don'ts
regarding talking to the press.

26:24.810 --> 26:25.879
You're what?
Running.

26:25.910 --> 26:28.242
For state's attorney.
Why?

26:28.280 --> 26:30.817
I think I could do a good job
of it.
How does this work

26:30.850 --> 26:32.738
with you being a lawyer?
Well,
I'll still have

26:32.790 --> 26:34.917
my ongoing cases
that I'll be involved with

26:34.960 --> 26:36.279
during my campaign.
But if
you Win,

26:36.320 --> 26:37.787
you'll have to quit.

26:37.830 --> 26:39.752
Yes, I'll be state's attorney.

26:39.790 --> 26:41.121
Where does this come from,
Alicia?

26:41.160 --> 26:44.288
So here's what I need
from you two.

26:44.330 --> 26:46.719
My team worries
that there are

26:46.770 --> 26:48.761
some issues in your life--
both your lives...
"My team"?

26:48.800 --> 26:51.405
You're-you're already talking
about a team?
Why not

26:51.440 --> 26:53.806
just take a trip?
You'd love Bali.

26:53.840 --> 26:55.000
This is empty nest syndrome.

26:55.040 --> 26:56.837
You know, I read this great book
about it...

26:56.880 --> 27:00.008
Mom, did you hit a kid
in a department store?

27:01.180 --> 27:02.716
What?

27:02.750 --> 27:05.844
Did you hit a five-year-old kid
named Greg Weymouth

27:05.890 --> 27:07.858
in Browards'
dress department?
That's crazy.

27:07.890 --> 27:09.187
Where'd you hear that?

27:09.220 --> 27:10.824
It was videotaped.

27:10.860 --> 27:11.827
(chuckles)

27:11.860 --> 27:12.849
Wait,
are you kidding?

27:12.890 --> 27:14.699
This is fantastic.

27:14.730 --> 27:16.095
It was a spanking.
I didn't hit him.
Well,

27:16.130 --> 27:17.688
his parents are thinking
of suing.
I was

27:17.730 --> 27:19.027
doing them a favor.
That kid was running

27:19.070 --> 27:20.833
around the
store, yelling.

27:20.870 --> 27:22.735
He was knocking over things.
It was...

27:22.770 --> 27:25.102
A public service.
Yes.
Even though

27:25.140 --> 27:26.698
you're making fun of me, it was.
Well,
I set up

27:26.740 --> 27:28.731
an appointment with the parents.

27:28.780 --> 27:30.771
I need you to apologize.
No.

27:30.810 --> 27:32.778
They should apologize to me.
I was

27:32.810 --> 27:35.278
doing them
a favor.
Mom, I need you
to do this

27:35.320 --> 27:38.118
_ for me. _
It Will become a news item.

27:39.790 --> 27:42.111
Now,
Owen...

27:42.160 --> 27:44.879
What? Um, what did I do?

27:44.930 --> 27:47.182
Why don't you join me
in the kitchen.
Wait,

27:47.230 --> 27:48.993
why does Owen get
privacy and I didn't?

27:50.900 --> 27:53.027
Because mine's
way worse.

27:53.070 --> 27:54.992
They just
discovered the body.

28:02.240 --> 28:04.208
Are you careful?
Am I careful?

28:04.250 --> 28:07.845
I... tend to be.
What-what do you mean?

28:07.880 --> 28:10.713
Safe sex. HIV rates

28:10.750 --> 28:13.014
have been steadily climbing
in the past few years.
I'm all good,

28:13.050 --> 28:15.109
sis. Don't worry
your little head.

28:15.160 --> 28:17.720
Phil's married.
Did you know that?

28:17.760 --> 28:20.354
Who's Phil?

28:20.390 --> 28:23.860
He also performs in gay porn
without...

28:23.900 --> 28:25.720
protection.

28:29.840 --> 28:31.899
They looked into my background.

28:31.940 --> 28:35.171
And when they did, they looked
into my family's, too.

28:38.280 --> 28:40.077
Owen.

28:40.110 --> 28:41.873
Owen.

28:41.920 --> 28:43.888
(phone ringing)

28:43.920 --> 28:45.444
VERONICA:
Where's Owen going?

28:51.430 --> 28:53.182
(phone clatters)

28:53.230 --> 28:55.198
ELI:
Yes.

28:55.230 --> 28:58.495
Eli, do you have some issue
with me?

28:58.530 --> 29:01.431
No.
Well, just
so you know,

29:01.470 --> 29:04.109
I'm not trying
to undercut Alicia's campaign.

29:04.140 --> 29:07.268
I didn't say you were.

29:09.940 --> 29:11.908
Okay.

29:11.950 --> 29:13.872
Okay what?
Okay,

29:13.920 --> 29:14.978
fire her.

29:15.020 --> 29:17.818
Get her a new job
in Springfield.

29:17.850 --> 29:19.841
The intern?
Yes.

29:19.890 --> 29:20.914
Lauren Lytton. The intern.

29:20.960 --> 29:22.985
You've been trying
to get rid of her for a month.

29:23.020 --> 29:25.124
Get her a job in the senate.

29:25.160 --> 29:28.049
I think that, uh,
Shaw's looking for someone.

29:30.400 --> 29:32.994
Where's Lauren?
Down the hall.

29:33.030 --> 29:35.134
Take her name
off the security logs.

29:35.170 --> 29:36.068
Really?

29:38.370 --> 29:40.099
Lauren.

29:40.140 --> 29:42.074
What?

29:42.110 --> 29:45.375
You're fired.

29:45.410 --> 29:48.379
(sighs)
So...

29:48.420 --> 29:51.389
this is a nice change for us.
Not yelling

29:51.420 --> 29:53.183
at each other
in court.

29:53.220 --> 29:56.189
There's a photo of you
leaving my apartment

29:56.220 --> 29:59.326
at 8:30 am. on March 18.

29:59.360 --> 30:00.918
Really?

30:00.960 --> 30:02.222
Is it a good photo?

30:02.260 --> 30:04.160
Depends.

30:04.200 --> 30:06.191
Were we up to
something naughty?

30:06.230 --> 30:07.390
Witness prep.

30:07.430 --> 30:09.091
(exhales)
Disgusting.

30:09.140 --> 30:11.358
(chuckles)
Thanks.

30:12.970 --> 30:15.939
If they ask you about it, Finn,

30:15.980 --> 30:18.346
you'd say it was
about the disciplinary hearing?

30:18.380 --> 30:20.348
You mean the truth? Sure.

30:20.380 --> 30:22.974
Unless you want me to say
I stayed the night.

30:23.020 --> 30:26.114
Probably not.

30:26.150 --> 30:28.414
Sorry. I'm in a funny mood.
I don't know why.

30:28.460 --> 30:31.429
I-I know... I know why.
Because, uh...

30:31.460 --> 30:33.951
I thought that maybe there'd be
some tension between us

30:34.000 --> 30:35.422
because...

30:35.460 --> 30:36.950
You're trying to put my partner
in prison?

30:37.000 --> 30:38.399
Yeah. Kind of has a way

30:40.130 --> 30:41.290
(chuckles)

30:41.340 --> 30:43.467
And I thought
there'd be tension because...

30:43.500 --> 30:46.901
I'm thinking
about running.

30:46.940 --> 30:48.908
No.

30:48.940 --> 30:51.545
I think it's
great. Honestly.

30:51.580 --> 30:53.946
I'm glad you called.

30:53.980 --> 30:56.244
Come on. Take a cab.

30:56.280 --> 30:57.349
Drink with me.
What's wrong with you?

30:57.380 --> 30:59.348
(chuckles)
I'd better not.

30:59.390 --> 31:02.086
What, do something
you regret, like...

31:02.120 --> 31:04.224
more witness prep?

31:04.260 --> 31:06.854
(chuckles)

31:08.660 --> 31:10.196
I'd better go.

31:11.600 --> 31:14.091
Castro wants to scare you
from the race

31:14.140 --> 31:15.937
by hitting you
where you're vulnerable.

31:15.970 --> 31:17.232
He said that?

31:17.270 --> 31:19.033
I heard him say it.

31:19.070 --> 31:20.503
Be careful.

31:20.540 --> 31:24.078
Don't be vulnerable.
If you can help it.

31:24.110 --> 31:26.999
ZACH (recorded):
You've reached
Zach's voice mail.

31:27.050 --> 31:28.472
I'm in class right now
or sleeping it off.

31:28.520 --> 31:30.317
Leave a message.
ALICIA:
Zach,

31:30.350 --> 31:33.319
it's Mom. Something's come up.
Call me tomorrow.

31:33.350 --> 31:35.910
(siren wailing)

31:35.960 --> 31:38.428
Oh, no. No.

31:38.460 --> 31:40.052
(exhales)

31:40.090 --> 31:42.229
One glass of wine. That's all.

31:42.260 --> 31:44.626
OFFICER (over speaker):
Pull to the side of the road.

31:51.140 --> 31:52.937
Good evening,
Mrs. Florrick.

31:52.970 --> 31:55.109
Have you been
drinking?

31:55.140 --> 31:57.506
How did you know my name?

31:59.150 --> 32:01.345
Please step out of the car,
ma'am.

32:09.020 --> 32:11.159
Nine steps forward, ma'am. Turn
on the line, nine steps back.
I've...

32:11.190 --> 32:13.124
I've already agreed
to a Breathalyzer test.

32:13.160 --> 32:16.459
Yes, you said that, ma'am. I
need you to turn on the line,

32:16.500 --> 32:18.024
nine steps back.

32:20.270 --> 32:22.238
I have admitted
to having one glass of wine,

32:22.270 --> 32:24.431
which would make my BAC
well below the legal limit.

32:24.470 --> 32:27.268
This is called a horizontal
gaze nystagmus test.

32:27.310 --> 32:28.675
I need you
to follow

32:28.710 --> 32:30.473
my flashlight.

32:34.220 --> 32:35.619
(phone rings)

32:35.650 --> 32:37.618
Hello. What's wrong?

32:37.650 --> 32:39.618
I was just pulled over, Eli.

32:39.650 --> 32:41.618
Damn it. For a DUI.

32:41.660 --> 32:43.616
Oh, my God. Where are you?

32:43.660 --> 32:45.457
I'm in my car. I passed.

32:45.490 --> 32:48.050
I only had one glass of wine.
But...

32:48.100 --> 32:50.091
I think it was a setup.

32:50.130 --> 32:52.496
Why?
Because I volunteered
a Breathalyzer,

32:52.530 --> 32:55.090
but he insisted
on a roadside test.

32:55.140 --> 32:57.096
Okay, I'll keep an eye
on the blogs.

32:57.140 --> 32:58.562
Good. Call me.

32:58.610 --> 33:01.170
OFFICER:
Pull into the traffic,
ma'am. Let's go.

33:01.210 --> 33:03.701
(starts engine)

33:20.260 --> 33:25.061
Kalinda, hello.

33:25.100 --> 33:27.091
I need a moment.

33:27.130 --> 33:30.133
It's nothing bad.

33:30.170 --> 33:31.501
Five minutes.

33:33.170 --> 33:36.139
I know that's where
you have your gun.

33:36.180 --> 33:38.478
You won't need it.

33:43.280 --> 33:46.147
This is Clyde and Jim.

33:46.190 --> 33:48.784
Hi.

33:48.820 --> 33:54.099
Your firm tried to
drop me as a client.

33:54.130 --> 33:57.691
This is my best
month in five years.

33:57.730 --> 34:01.689
I pay on time,
I pay well,

34:01.740 --> 34:03.799
and yet your firm

34:03.840 --> 34:06.536
wanted to drop me.

34:06.570 --> 34:08.128
Why?

34:08.180 --> 34:10.205
I don't know.

34:10.240 --> 34:12.208
I didn't even know
that they had tried to drop you.

34:12.250 --> 34:13.205
Is it the
subpoena?

34:13.250 --> 34:15.639
I don't think so.

34:15.680 --> 34:18.240
There's nothing there.

34:18.290 --> 34:20.315
Is it about Cary?

34:20.350 --> 34:23.148
Is he in deeper trouble
than I thought?

34:23.190 --> 34:25.727
No.

34:25.760 --> 34:27.523
Then I'm confused.

34:29.900 --> 34:32.698
You should talk to Alicia.

34:32.730 --> 34:35.290
Why?

34:36.240 --> 34:38.765
KaHnda?

34:38.810 --> 34:42.530
Alicia's considering running
for state's attorney.

34:42.580 --> 34:44.605
I'm not sure
if that's why, but...

34:44.650 --> 34:47.278
it would make sense.

34:51.720 --> 34:54.689
Huh.

34:54.720 --> 34:57.188
(loud thumping)

35:03.900 --> 35:07.290
Thank you for doing this,
Mrs. Weymouth. Veronica.

35:07.330 --> 35:10.231
We just wanted to
apologize for the events

35:10.270 --> 35:13.239
of last week.
You mean when she hit my son?

35:13.270 --> 35:15.477
Yes._Veronica
realizes now

35:15.510 --> 35:17.307
_that she was
in the wrong.

35:17.340 --> 35:20.309
Yes, I was in the wrong.

35:20.350 --> 35:23.148
ALICIA:
I'm sorry I'm late.
Mrs. Weymouth.

35:23.180 --> 35:24.511
You're the
governor's Wife?

35:24.550 --> 35:27.348
Yes. And this
must be Greg. Hi.

35:29.360 --> 35:32.329
I'm sure my mother has expressed
her deepest regrets

35:32.360 --> 35:34.191
at her overreacting
last week.
No.

35:34.230 --> 35:37.324
I just see her smiling there.

35:37.360 --> 35:40.466
I deeply regret my overreaction.

35:40.500 --> 35:42.468
We're hoping this settles
the matter, Myra.

35:42.500 --> 35:43.797
It does.

35:43.840 --> 35:46.206
That and $50,000.

35:46.240 --> 35:48.208
What?
You don't want
a swt. I get it.

35:48.240 --> 35:49.468
But Greg was scarred

35:49.510 --> 35:50.909
by this.
VERONICA:
He was not scarred.

35:50.940 --> 35:52.476
IfI had wanted to scar him...

35:52.510 --> 35:54.478
ALICIA:
Mom. Mrs. Weymouth,

35:54.520 --> 35:56.374
we're not
gonna just

35:56.420 --> 35:57.739
give you $50,000.

35:57.780 --> 35:59.418
Okay. I'll see you in court.

35:59.450 --> 36:01.657
I should've spanked
you, you bitch.

36:01.690 --> 36:03.612
Oh, you know What, let's go.
Just try it.

36:03.660 --> 36:07.426
(overlapping arguing)

36:11.400 --> 36:14.198
GRACE:
Mom, is that you?

36:14.240 --> 36:16.299
Yeah, did Zach call?
No. Come here.

36:16.340 --> 36:17.591
You have
to see this.

36:17.640 --> 36:19.301
What?

36:19.340 --> 36:21.308
Hi, Mrs. Florrick.
Jennifer.

36:21.340 --> 36:24.309
What's going on?
I'm just editing
Grace's video.

36:24.350 --> 36:26.272
But look.

36:26.310 --> 36:30.815
I have a Google alert on
your name, and this popped up.

36:30.850 --> 36:32.488
JENNIFER:
It's cool, Mrs. Florrick.

36:32.520 --> 36:35.318
Like Hillary, huh?
Oh, no. Eli.

36:35.360 --> 36:36.349
But look.

36:36.390 --> 36:38.358
Look how much they've raised.

36:38.390 --> 36:41.257
It just started 24 hours ago,
and you already have $83...

36:41.300 --> 36:42.858
$84,000.
But I haven't decided

36:42.900 --> 36:45.289
to run yet.
You have
to run.

36:45.330 --> 36:46.262
People are giving money.

36:46.300 --> 36:47.995
ELI:
It's a PAC.

36:48.030 --> 36:49.338
And we had nothing to do
with it. I'm serious.

36:49.370 --> 36:50.928
Alicia, it is illegal for us

36:50.970 --> 36:53.336
to have anything to do
with something like this.

36:53.370 --> 36:56.373
And even if it weren't,
we didn't do this. Did you?

36:56.410 --> 36:59.379
No. It's a popular expression
of grassroots approval.
What's wrong?

36:59.410 --> 37:00.900
The intern's here.

37:00.950 --> 37:02.542
The intern is...

37:02.580 --> 37:04.389
Alicia, I have to call you back.

37:04.420 --> 37:05.717
You saw her here?
No.

37:05.750 --> 37:07.286
I have a security alert
on my account

37:07.320 --> 37:09.584
in case the governor
signs her back in. Right there.

37:10.820 --> 37:12.788
When was_ the entrance?
Ten minutes ago.

37:12.830 --> 37:14.559
Where's the governor?
In his office.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.898
Door closed.
Damn it.

37:16.930 --> 37:19.421
It's like a grade school
around here.

37:19.470 --> 37:20.869
(Peter speaks indistinctly)

37:20.900 --> 37:23.460
(woman laughs)

37:23.500 --> 37:25.400
What are
you gonna do?

37:25.440 --> 37:27.704
(woman laughs)

37:27.740 --> 37:29.298
Mr. Governor, I am seeing...

37:29.340 --> 37:32.468
(door shuts)
Hello.

37:32.510 --> 37:35.479
Eli, I'd like you to meet an old
friend of mine, Ramona Lytton.

37:35.520 --> 37:37.943
I'm trying to convince her
not to become a lobbyist.

37:37.980 --> 37:38.947
(laughs)

37:38.990 --> 37:41.311
Eli. Gold.

37:41.360 --> 37:45.456
Ramona Lytton.
So you're Lauren's...

37:45.490 --> 37:47.481
Don't you dare butter me up
by saying "sister."

37:47.530 --> 37:48.952
Mother.
(chuckles)
However,

37:49.000 --> 37:50.456
uh, Ramona did
have her at 12.

37:50.500 --> 37:52.320
Oh, stop it.

37:52.370 --> 37:54.793
So, is Eli who I have to thank?

37:54.840 --> 37:56.489
Yep. It was all his idea.

37:56.540 --> 37:58.701
Mmm. Thank you, Eli.

37:58.740 --> 38:01.538
My idea?
Getting Lauren a job
in Shaw's senate office.

38:01.580 --> 38:03.502
And thank you
for tolerating her here.

38:03.540 --> 38:05.007
She was sad to leave.

38:05.050 --> 38:08.542
Yes, it was s-sad.

38:12.520 --> 38:14.886
Eli.

38:17.960 --> 38:20.520
(quietly):
See, that's Why I didn't want
to fire Lauren.

38:20.560 --> 38:22.357
Her mother was going
through a hard time

38:22.400 --> 38:23.753
and she asked me
to get her a job.

38:23.800 --> 38:26.894
How do you know her?
She's
a family friend.

38:26.930 --> 38:29.899
Show a little relief, Eli.

38:29.940 --> 38:33.603
I wasn't sleeping with Lauren.

38:33.640 --> 38:35.608
(door opens)

38:35.640 --> 38:37.437
(door shuts)

38:37.480 --> 38:39.300
(Ramona laughs)

38:46.720 --> 38:48.688
Hello, Greg.

38:48.720 --> 38:49.982
Hello, Myra.
Hi.

38:50.020 --> 38:51.624
Where are we
on the money?

38:51.660 --> 38:52.922
Here we are.

38:52.960 --> 38:55.827
What's this?
Surveillance video.

38:55.860 --> 38:57.521
These are the store's cameras.

38:57.560 --> 39:00.768
MYRA:
There. See?

39:00.800 --> 39:01.994
I don't know What you thought
this would prove.

39:02.040 --> 39:05.009
This is your mom
spanking my son.

39:05.040 --> 39:06.701
JOHNNY:
Yes, it is. And this
is three minutes earlier.

39:09.640 --> 39:11.949
MYRA:
So?

39:11.980 --> 39:13.800
JOHNNY:
And this...

39:13.850 --> 39:17.069
is three minutes before that.

39:17.120 --> 39:18.815
Now, this woman

39:18.850 --> 39:21.819
is an 86-year-old widow
named Mrs. Skreeker,

39:21.860 --> 39:24.749
and she'd like to_know
Who's responSIble
for several thousand dollars

39:24.790 --> 39:26.985
in hospital bills.

39:27.030 --> 39:28.452
Your move, Myra.
ALICIA:
I think

39:28.500 --> 39:29.694
it would be best
if you accepted

39:29.730 --> 39:30.822
our apology,
ma'am.

39:30.860 --> 39:32.623
It'll make life easier.

39:32.670 --> 39:35.662
(phone ringing)

39:35.700 --> 39:38.669
Let's go. Let's go.

39:40.870 --> 39:42.804
Where are you?
In my room. At school.

39:42.840 --> 39:44.876
Mom, I'm so sorry. Dad told me.

39:44.910 --> 39:46.571
Told you what?

39:46.610 --> 39:50.114
That you're upset
about the Nisa thing.

39:50.150 --> 39:51.788
What's the Nisa thing?

39:51.820 --> 39:54.186
I wanted to tell you.
Mom, I really did.

39:54.220 --> 39:56.654
Ijust... didn't want
to get Nisa in trouble.

39:56.690 --> 39:58.851
Were Nisa's parents there?

39:58.890 --> 40:00.687
Where?

40:00.730 --> 40:03.198
(quietly):
At the abortion clinic.

40:03.230 --> 40:05.528
Yes. But-but, Mom,
I didn't know that.

40:05.570 --> 40:09.165
And I-I didn't know What Nisa
wanted. It all happened so fast.

40:09.200 --> 40:12.601
I said you could go
to check out Boston College.

40:12.640 --> 40:14.437
I saw you leave
with your duffel bag.

40:14.480 --> 40:17.438
I know, Mom. I'm sorry.

40:17.480 --> 40:20.176
I'm so sorry.

40:20.210 --> 40:22.713
Have you smoked pot, Zach?

40:22.750 --> 40:24.445
What?

40:24.490 --> 40:26.549
When you said
that you hadn't smoked pot,

40:26.590 --> 40:28.751
were you lying?

40:28.790 --> 40:30.883
M-Mom, here's the thing...

40:30.920 --> 40:35.152
No, Zach. Don't embarrass
yourself by saying any more.

40:35.200 --> 40:37.725
I'm running
for state's attorney.

40:37.760 --> 40:41.059
My parenting skills
will be called into question.

40:41.100 --> 40:43.159
I need you to say
that I am a good parent,

40:43.200 --> 40:45.168
that I knew about your abortion.

40:45.210 --> 40:47.838
We talked about it.
I gave you all the options.

40:47.870 --> 40:49.679
I counseled you
to have the baby.

40:49.710 --> 40:52.599
I would help take care of it.
You decided against that.

40:52.650 --> 40:54.675
That was your right.
Do you understand?

40:56.020 --> 40:58.488
Why are you running
for state's attorney?

40:58.520 --> 41:00.010
(scoffs)

41:00.050 --> 41:03.656
Have fun in college, Zach.

41:03.690 --> 41:05.885
(sighs)

41:26.050 --> 41:28.109
Mr. Elfman.

41:28.150 --> 41:29.811
Yes, I have
to show you something.

41:30.850 --> 41:32.886
I'm running.

41:32.920 --> 41:35.582
Good.

41:35.620 --> 41:38.214
'Cause there's an article coming
out about you going into detox

41:38.260 --> 41:39.727
for your alcohol addiction.

41:39.760 --> 41:41.591
What?

41:41.630 --> 41:43.825
And...

41:43.860 --> 41:46.761
there's a photo.

41:48.170 --> 41:50.161
(scoffs)

42:06.650 --> 42:08.083
Mrs. Florrick.

42:08.120 --> 42:10.782
Mr. Bishop, hi.
Is everything all right?

42:10.820 --> 42:14.859
It is. I decided to take your
advice and hire another firm.

42:14.900 --> 42:16.595
Good. I think
that's for the best.

42:16.630 --> 42:17.824
I'm also saying

42:17.860 --> 42:20.658
that you fired me as a client.

42:20.700 --> 42:23.134
And I'm very upset.

42:23.170 --> 42:25.832
I... Y-You don't need
to do that, Mr. Bishop.
I know.

42:25.870 --> 42:27.337
But it's good for you.

42:27.370 --> 42:29.338
Oh. Here.

42:29.380 --> 42:32.838
We can't coordinate,
but you can get to me

42:32.880 --> 42:34.848
through my
associate.

42:34.880 --> 42:37.144
Get to you, um, about what?

42:37.180 --> 42:39.648
Your PAC.
I mean,

42:39.690 --> 42:41.817
the PAC that I set up
in support of you.

42:41.860 --> 42:44.829
$140,000 and
counﬁng.

42:44.860 --> 42:46.851
That's...
Yes.

42:46.890 --> 42:49.723
The least
I could do.

42:49.760 --> 42:51.864
There's more money
Where that came from.

42:51.900 --> 42:54.630
We'll be in touch.

42:55.670 --> 42:57.888
