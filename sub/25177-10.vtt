00:00.031 --> 00:02.085
<i>Previously,
on</i> "Cloak and Dagger"...

00:02.329 --> 00:04.276
What happened to us
back there? Why us?

00:04.353 --> 00:07.018
People didn't just die
in the Core, they were infected.

00:07.095 --> 00:09.360
That fear spreads
from person to person.

00:09.437 --> 00:10.383
I call them Terrors.

00:10.460 --> 00:13.110
A valve is part of a complex
and thoughtful system

00:13.187 --> 00:14.562
connected to a new drill.

00:15.939 --> 00:19.127
If I had a knife of light, Detective
Connors would be dead and buried.

00:19.204 --> 00:21.619
How's your little quest
for justice feeling now?

00:21.696 --> 00:23.575
Tyrone Johnson!
You are under arrest

00:23.652 --> 00:24.912
for the murder
of Officer Fuchs!

00:24.989 --> 00:26.633
Mr. Scarborough
sends his regards.

00:27.847 --> 00:30.554
Three... two... one.

00:43.879 --> 00:45.749
The first time we know
what happened

00:45.826 --> 00:49.624
was the Great Famine
that stuck the Chocktaw people.

00:49.701 --> 00:53.538
The crops were fallow.
The fish had not bitten.

00:53.641 --> 00:57.108
The men that went off
to find help never came back.

00:59.918 --> 01:03.967
But through this darkness,
two lights shine bright,

01:04.069 --> 01:06.566
two children
who were alive and healthy

01:06.643 --> 01:09.259
despite nature's
angriest efforts.

01:09.336 --> 01:12.377
It was on their shoulders
to save the whole village.

01:13.402 --> 01:16.456
That one of set of shoulders
with the mark on it, of course,

01:16.533 --> 01:18.526
bore most of all that weight.

01:20.926 --> 01:22.745
It wasn't fair.

01:23.035 --> 01:26.893
It wasn't anything
resembling justice.

01:27.692 --> 01:29.088
It just was.

01:50.581 --> 01:51.880
But when she died,

01:51.957 --> 01:54.299
they say the land
grew fertile again,

01:54.637 --> 01:56.278
the fish came back,

01:56.355 --> 01:59.313
and from that seed
of sacrifice grew the city

01:59.390 --> 02:02.276
we would probably know
as New Orleans.

02:30.801 --> 02:34.482
Three... two... one.

02:34.559 --> 02:36.839
Don't hurt her,
or you'll never see the files.

02:36.916 --> 02:39.620
- Tandy, get out of here!
- Mom, I got this.

02:39.801 --> 02:42.502
What files? -The ones
you're here to kill me over.

02:42.668 --> 02:46.592
Roxxon's off-point oil rig turned
its workers into primal screams.

02:47.969 --> 02:51.428
Clever...
your water delivery getup.

02:51.555 --> 02:53.009
Use what you can
to survive, right?

02:53.086 --> 02:55.064
Well, then, I suggest you
use those sensible shoes

02:55.141 --> 02:56.202
and get out of my mother's home.

02:56.279 --> 02:57.413
Read the room, princess.

02:57.490 --> 02:59.132
I kind of hold all the cards.

02:59.209 --> 03:01.397
Maybe I have a few
up my sleeves.

03:01.578 --> 03:04.163
Scarborough didn't tell you
about me, did he?

03:04.711 --> 03:08.392
That makes sense. He's a
need-to-know kind of guy.

03:08.469 --> 03:10.751
And this, I'm assuming,
is his need to clean up

03:10.828 --> 03:12.796
everyone who knows too much
about that rig.

03:12.873 --> 03:15.491
- Don't step any closer!
- Tandy, what are you doing?

03:15.568 --> 03:18.320
Ivan and Mina.
Do they know too much, too?

03:18.397 --> 03:20.086
Don't move, I'm serious!

03:20.163 --> 03:22.756
About what?
I'm unarmed.

03:24.335 --> 03:25.485
No!

03:37.416 --> 03:39.766
Hiyah!

03:47.342 --> 03:48.731
Are you okay?

03:48.922 --> 03:50.692
Yeah, are you?

03:51.686 --> 03:54.981
No. No, Mom,
I... I screwed up.

03:55.832 --> 03:57.085
Mom, listen, okay?

03:57.162 --> 03:58.759
I need you to go
to Mr. Munney's,

03:58.836 --> 04:00.983
and I need you to tell him that
the government is after you.

04:01.060 --> 04:02.271
He'll keep you safe.

04:04.681 --> 04:06.685
<i>Mina here.
You have been missed.</i>

04:06.762 --> 04:08.472
- <i>Please leave a mess..</i>.
- I got to go.

04:08.549 --> 04:10.387
Hey. Where are you going?

04:11.006 --> 04:14.146
- I need to go help some people.
- Why you?

04:17.493 --> 04:18.750
Why not?

04:45.296 --> 04:47.357
You looking for this?

04:51.361 --> 04:53.515
I... I already know
what you're gonna say.

04:53.611 --> 04:56.185
You have no idea
what I'm going to say.

04:56.486 --> 04:58.251
Because I have no idea.

04:58.478 --> 05:00.222
I get a call
from your mother.

05:00.299 --> 05:03.517
She's hysterical because the police
are calling you a cop killer.

05:03.594 --> 05:05.975
- I didn't kill anyone.
- Of course you didn't.

05:06.052 --> 05:09.663
But, Tyrone, you need to run
as far away as you can,

05:09.740 --> 05:12.712
as fast as you can,
and never look back.

05:13.010 --> 05:14.501
You don't call us.

05:14.649 --> 05:16.629
You don't send us a postcard.

05:17.440 --> 05:19.102
You hear me?

05:20.289 --> 05:21.829
Yes, sir.

05:25.094 --> 05:29.556
Ty, I have no idea if I've
done any good as a father,

05:29.633 --> 05:30.945
for either of you boys.

05:33.172 --> 05:34.726
What can we
do for you, Officer?

05:34.803 --> 05:37.501
One of your Red Hawks seems to
have gone off the reservation.

05:37.578 --> 05:41.312
<i>I know you think
you're being clever,</i>

05:41.389 --> 05:44.516
<i>but the fact is,
that's quite racist.</i>

05:44.706 --> 05:48.319
<i>Our native brothers and sisters helped
our people survive</i>

05:48.396 --> 05:50.123
- <i>under slavery.</i>
- Listen.

05:50.245 --> 05:52.883
I'm gonna try to sneak you
out the back.

05:55.202 --> 05:56.362
Tyrone?

06:01.626 --> 06:02.916
Mina!

06:28.112 --> 06:30.262
How is this happening again?

06:31.826 --> 06:33.337
It's so far away
from the ri...

06:52.836 --> 06:54.229
Hey!

06:58.624 --> 07:01.635
Hey, are you okay?

07:02.814 --> 07:05.849
- What the hell happened to him?
- He turned into a Terror.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.698
- A what?
- Mina, listen.

07:08.006 --> 07:10.927
Eight years ago,
on the rig that stole our dads,

07:11.004 --> 07:13.768
the entire crew went crazy,
just like this guy did.

07:13.845 --> 07:16.297
No, that's not true.
The reports from the rig...

07:16.374 --> 07:17.830
Were Scarborough lies!

07:17.928 --> 07:21.413
Aimed at getting you back in there to
extract whatever had that kind of power.

07:21.490 --> 07:23.526
That power made people crazy.

07:23.647 --> 07:26.260
It turned their adrenaline
up to 22.

07:26.415 --> 07:28.330
Your dad called
them Terrors.

07:28.802 --> 07:31.981
Yeah, he always did have a knack
for accurate nomenclature.

07:32.086 --> 07:35.594
Dan was there at the valve when it
blew, and then they were chasing me...

07:35.671 --> 07:37.619
That power is rearing
its head again.

07:37.876 --> 07:40.548
Heads... plural.

07:40.625 --> 07:41.968
What?

07:43.765 --> 07:45.344
There are nine other valves,

07:45.421 --> 07:47.563
spread out around the city
by design.

07:47.706 --> 07:49.885
My design.

07:53.187 --> 07:55.549
The rest of my map
is feeling the pressure, too.

07:55.626 --> 07:57.434
It's only a matter of
time until they blow.

07:57.511 --> 07:59.256
Okay, so what do we do
to stop it?

08:00.345 --> 08:01.517
Mina!

08:01.609 --> 08:03.976
Yeah... okay.

08:04.352 --> 08:07.081
There may be a way
to shut it off, centrally.

08:07.462 --> 08:08.899
But we need to get to Roxxon.

08:08.976 --> 08:11.070
Of course we do.

08:52.956 --> 08:55.632
One-Adam-Nine,
possible match to APB.

09:21.069 --> 09:23.968
Stop! NOPD! Stop!

09:25.556 --> 09:27.209
- Get in!
- Thank God.

09:27.286 --> 09:29.046
Show me your hands!

09:29.123 --> 09:31.009
- Freeze!
- Hands! Let me see 'em!

09:31.086 --> 09:32.906
What are you doing?
Do your thing!

09:36.834 --> 09:39.684
I can't. There's
too many people.

09:57.219 --> 09:59.820
They say
it was over a woman.

09:59.914 --> 10:02.437
They say it's why Leland,
the eldest brother,

10:02.514 --> 10:04.969
wore that mourning band
on his left arm.

10:05.046 --> 10:06.879
His heart had been broken.

10:06.956 --> 10:09.693
And just as the blue blood
of the Wilson brothers

10:09.770 --> 10:12.937
boiled over, New Orleans
was struck by a storm

10:13.014 --> 10:15.637
more devastating
than it had ever seen.

10:16.126 --> 10:18.965
And as brother faced off
against brother,

10:19.046 --> 10:21.551
it only looked to get worse.

10:28.206 --> 10:30.872
But Leland had
a change of heart in the rain.

10:31.046 --> 10:33.983
They say he found grace
when he was loading his gun.

10:34.060 --> 10:37.253
They say he knew somehow
that sacrificing himself

10:37.330 --> 10:39.643
was the only way
to save his family.

10:40.547 --> 10:43.606
And when he died,
he not only ended the feud,

10:43.717 --> 10:45.356
but the storm as well.

10:45.433 --> 10:49.373
And the young city of New Orleans
lived to see another day.

10:51.916 --> 10:54.874
It's a wonder that mantle
ain't come crashing down.

10:54.951 --> 10:57.434
Weight of the world
all up on it four times over.

10:57.511 --> 10:59.364
Maybe five now.

10:59.686 --> 11:02.484
You found her?
Tyrone's divine pairing?

11:02.561 --> 11:05.333
I found her, but she ain't
particularly divine.

11:06.102 --> 11:08.184
- Do they know?
- Know what?

11:08.376 --> 11:09.746
I have no idea
what's going on,

11:09.823 --> 11:11.286
or what's going to happen,
or what Tyrone

11:11.363 --> 11:13.006
and his friend
have to do with it.

11:13.083 --> 11:16.129
There is a danger
coming right at us.

11:16.214 --> 11:19.540
Fear bubbling just beneath
the skin of this city.

11:19.617 --> 11:22.979
Greed bringing our worst
instincts to the surface.

11:23.056 --> 11:24.807
I don't understand
how Tyrone and that girl

11:24.884 --> 11:26.684
can do anything about that.

11:26.945 --> 11:30.169
That's why we need
to remember our history.

11:34.506 --> 11:36.330
Hey, you gonna book us
or what?

11:36.407 --> 11:37.772
What.

11:38.484 --> 11:39.972
What is going on?

11:40.049 --> 11:41.692
Nothing good.

11:49.086 --> 11:51.666
Police have issued
a warning for an aggressive celebration

11:51.743 --> 11:53.757
that has led to violence
in the Garden District.

11:53.834 --> 11:56.116
Authorities warn citizens
to avoid the area

11:56.193 --> 11:57.903
until the situation
has been nullified.

11:57.980 --> 11:59.062
How you doing?

11:59.139 --> 12:02.216
Aside from the crushing fear that in
trying to make the world a better place,

12:02.293 --> 12:04.895
- I might have broken it?
- Besides that?

12:05.428 --> 12:06.628
Yeah, I've been better.

12:06.705 --> 12:08.969
We're gonna fix this.
We're gonna fix this,

12:09.046 --> 12:10.698
and we're gonna get you back
to saving the world.

12:10.775 --> 12:12.542
Maybe I'm not cut out
to save her, Tandy.

12:12.619 --> 12:14.708
Mina, you might be
our only hope.

12:15.756 --> 12:18.184
And I know hope,
believe it or not.

12:18.296 --> 12:20.251
And destiny, this is yours.

12:20.328 --> 12:22.684
Destiny doesn't exist.

12:23.181 --> 12:24.781
Sure it does.

12:26.626 --> 12:29.396
It's just string theory
we don't understand yet, right?

12:38.099 --> 12:40.447
Why are we
back here and not in a cell?

12:40.524 --> 12:41.873
They have to book us
officially

12:41.950 --> 12:43.562
if they wanna put us in holding.

12:45.159 --> 12:49.562
But we're not here officially,
so if something happens to us...

12:49.639 --> 12:52.474
It's looking less like "if"
and more like "when."

12:52.551 --> 12:55.744
Unless you can, you know,
do your thing.

13:09.246 --> 13:11.062
Look, I'm trying, I am.

13:11.759 --> 13:13.896
I need that cloak
to control it.

13:15.296 --> 13:18.159
Or someone
to fire a gun at me.

13:18.236 --> 13:20.106
Hey, beware
of what you wish for.

13:23.275 --> 13:25.250
Lafayette, right?

13:25.446 --> 13:26.875
You're not supposed to talk.

13:26.952 --> 13:28.966
Yeah, they've been telling me
that my whole life,

13:29.043 --> 13:30.750
but here I am, gabbing.

13:31.697 --> 13:33.756
So, uh, what are we waiting for?

13:33.876 --> 13:36.529
What, you guys can't do anything
without Connors, is that it?

13:36.606 --> 13:37.891
What am I not getting here?

13:37.968 --> 13:41.586
Everything, 'cause you're
not from here, O'Reilly.

13:45.323 --> 13:48.648
I am.
Straight up.

13:49.811 --> 13:53.593
I... I grew up in the Lower Ninth
and now I live in MidCity.

13:54.056 --> 13:57.171
- And now you're a cop killer.
- I'm not any kind of killer.

13:57.666 --> 14:00.469
And Fuchs? I knew him
for less than a day,

14:00.546 --> 14:02.943
- and he's more cop than you'll ever be.
- You watch your mouth, boy.

14:03.020 --> 14:04.593
Don't call me boy.

14:04.882 --> 14:07.850
My name is Tyrone,
my parents pay taxes,

14:07.927 --> 14:10.554
and it's your job
to protect me.

14:11.702 --> 14:14.093
And if you're really 504,
you would know that.

14:15.812 --> 14:18.640
You know, I got a mom
worried sick about me?

14:19.750 --> 14:23.203
And a dad ready take on
the world to protect me.

14:23.976 --> 14:26.070
I bet your parents
would do the same.

14:29.126 --> 14:31.846
Listen, I get you're afraid,
we all are.

14:34.072 --> 14:36.461
Most of the time
we have a good reason to be.

14:37.132 --> 14:38.852
But right now...

14:40.376 --> 14:43.105
I need you to find
a reason to be just,

14:43.650 --> 14:45.306
to protect us.

14:47.126 --> 14:48.781
Look, you took an oath,

14:49.089 --> 14:53.171
and right now, you have
two lives in your hands.

14:53.919 --> 14:56.078
Understand that power.

14:57.064 --> 14:58.540
Please.

15:12.096 --> 15:14.946
Connors just pulled up.
He's putting the place on lockdown.

15:15.983 --> 15:18.445
Yeah, watch them
for me, okay?

15:19.157 --> 15:20.887
Where... Where you going?

15:43.474 --> 15:45.024
Hey, again.

15:47.175 --> 15:48.865
I can tell by
the look on your face,

15:48.942 --> 15:51.328
you already know about the valve
that blew by Mina's.

15:51.407 --> 15:53.406
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

15:53.712 --> 15:56.156
For a while, you were
the only one that knew.

15:56.916 --> 15:59.328
But you kept
scratching that itch,

15:59.665 --> 16:02.877
and now, instead of a handful of
Terrors on an isolated oil rig,

16:02.954 --> 16:05.319
we're looking at a whole city
about to destroy itself.

16:05.422 --> 16:07.585
What's so important down there?

16:10.336 --> 16:11.922
Power.

16:12.375 --> 16:15.663
And with great power
comes even more power.

16:15.740 --> 16:18.639
In this day and age, you need
to keep up with the Joneses,

16:18.716 --> 16:20.772
as well as the Starks
and the Rands.

16:20.849 --> 16:23.246
What we need to do
is shut all of this down,

16:23.323 --> 16:24.663
which is why we're here.

16:24.740 --> 16:27.969
We tried, but the equipment
at the Core is not responding.

16:28.046 --> 16:30.507
We've lost the ability
to shut it down remotely.

16:30.584 --> 16:32.773
You had me build these things
all over the city.

16:32.912 --> 16:36.022
We put one near a school
and a police station.

16:36.099 --> 16:38.583
City property
is the easiest to indemnify.

16:38.660 --> 16:40.444
Aah!

16:40.521 --> 16:42.319
You said Core.

16:42.546 --> 16:44.924
Mina, that's where
we were on the rig, we were in the Core.

16:45.001 --> 16:48.018
And that's where we shut it off. There's
a kill switch and three shut-off valves.

16:48.095 --> 16:49.780
Shut it down
manually, yeah.

16:49.857 --> 16:52.288
- Yeah, okay.
- So where is it?

16:54.710 --> 16:58.186
It's in our annex building 616,
by the waterfront.

17:00.170 --> 17:02.850
See, that wasn't so hard,
was it?

17:12.904 --> 17:14.224
Look at me.

17:16.936 --> 17:18.507
Where are we?

17:18.617 --> 17:20.257
Your greatest hopes.

17:21.553 --> 17:24.849
This is the place
where anything is possible.

17:25.826 --> 17:27.465
You want power?

17:28.311 --> 17:29.601
I do.

17:29.930 --> 17:31.764
You want to be a God?

17:31.931 --> 17:33.740
I want to be God.

17:33.828 --> 17:35.624
Right through that door.

17:53.627 --> 17:56.316
- Thank you.
- For what?

17:56.672 --> 17:58.733
For being the one good cop.

17:59.992 --> 18:01.858
No, there's more than one.

18:02.704 --> 18:04.894
Not as many
as there should be.

18:07.953 --> 18:09.336
Well...

18:10.323 --> 18:13.577
if it isn't the Gaslight Gang,
all together again.

18:13.977 --> 18:16.132
We're all going
to take a drive.

18:16.263 --> 18:18.192
This one here,
he's gonna get loose.

18:18.269 --> 18:21.350
He's gonna kill you,
and then we're gonna kill him,

18:21.539 --> 18:25.585
and then we're gonna mourn you
like the fallen hero that you are.

18:28.456 --> 18:32.007
And you think, uh... the chief's
just gonna let any of that fly?

18:32.084 --> 18:33.436
It's Mardi Gras.

18:33.788 --> 18:36.030
Even if she weren't
waving from a float,

18:36.107 --> 18:40.149
she's got way too many citizens out
there saying farewell to the flesh.

18:40.226 --> 18:43.577
- It's mayhem, O'Reilly.
- No one's gonna believe you.

18:43.654 --> 18:45.624
They have so far, haven't they?

19:09.046 --> 19:11.505
Go get him! Get him!

19:16.734 --> 19:18.770
What was that guy on?

19:32.019 --> 19:35.810
The War of 1812
had been over for a month now.

19:35.999 --> 19:38.763
But the Battle of New Orleans
was fought so fierce

19:38.840 --> 19:41.747
that word couldn't get
to the battlefield.

19:42.197 --> 19:46.505
As legend has it, a young private
whose name was lost to history

19:46.582 --> 19:48.008
was tasked
with getting word

19:48.085 --> 19:50.630
of the ceasefire to General Jackson...

19:50.827 --> 19:53.056
..and fell short
of his delivery.

19:58.416 --> 20:02.192
As legend has it, he died in
the arms of a young refugee,

20:02.310 --> 20:06.520
and with but a look, he
passed his urgency on to her.

20:06.630 --> 20:08.809
His mission was executed.

20:08.953 --> 20:11.839
And because of this
divine pairing,

20:11.916 --> 20:16.936
this man without a name was the
last soldier to die for the cause.

20:17.849 --> 20:21.019
They didn't understand how
a young maiden could end a war,

20:21.096 --> 20:23.441
how a little girl
could stop a famine,

20:23.518 --> 20:28.742
a bullet could stop a storm, or the
love of one man could stop a plague,

20:28.819 --> 20:32.299
but here we are,
alive to tell the stories.

20:32.376 --> 20:33.812
How are we gonna help them?

20:33.889 --> 20:35.932
Suppose you tell them
of their destiny?

20:36.009 --> 20:37.296
You mean their fate.

20:37.373 --> 20:40.518
I mean, what has always
been the way:

20:40.719 --> 20:44.760
One must live,
one must die.

20:46.229 --> 20:47.589
We should've taken
my truck.

20:47.666 --> 20:49.682
Scarborough said the Core is
near the waterfront downtown.

20:49.759 --> 20:51.554
That's on the other side of the
Mardi Gras masses, there's no...

20:54.889 --> 20:56.835
Stay behind me, okay?

20:57.163 --> 20:58.203
Run!

21:06.702 --> 21:08.376
Come on!

21:14.536 --> 21:16.210
You try over there.

21:25.393 --> 21:27.790
I'm trying to find a ladder,
or some sort of roof access,

21:27.867 --> 21:29.233
but I'm not seeing...

21:30.281 --> 21:31.320
Mina?

21:33.705 --> 21:34.919
Mina!

21:42.654 --> 21:45.683
- What are these things?
- Fear itself. Look, don't touch!

22:00.944 --> 22:02.471
I need to find that cloak
you took from me.

22:02.548 --> 22:04.901
- My costume?
- He moved it to weapons.

22:12.976 --> 22:15.347
Go, go, go!
I'll hold 'em off!

22:33.586 --> 22:35.691
Let me see your hands.

22:37.976 --> 22:40.503
You need to get out of here
as fast as you can.

22:40.665 --> 22:42.402
What? -You need to
get out of town.

22:42.479 --> 22:44.432
- Not now.
- Especially now.

22:44.509 --> 22:47.296
No, everything I just said to
that cop, that's on me, too.

22:47.373 --> 22:50.855
Okay? I live here, too.
I need to help.

22:52.486 --> 22:53.917
You okay in here?

22:54.514 --> 22:55.723
I will be.

22:56.006 --> 22:58.464
As soon as I find
the mercy bullets.

22:58.959 --> 23:01.237
Hey, be safe.

23:01.498 --> 23:02.841
Ish.

23:02.994 --> 23:04.763
Yeah, you too.

the Spanish influenza</i>

24:32.456 --> 24:35.475
<i>spread throughout the globe,
killing millions.</i>

24:35.632 --> 24:38.116
<i>New Orleans was hit
harder than most.</i>

24:38.235 --> 24:41.970
<i>A young doctor named Jack Rogers
found himself running a clinic</i>

24:42.047 --> 24:46.087
<i>out of St. Theresa's Church, giving
everything he could to stem the tide</i>

24:46.164 --> 24:48.227
<i>against the plague.</i>

24:50.563 --> 24:54.937
<i>But when his lover, famed jazz
clarinetist Bobo Smith was struck</i>

24:55.014 --> 24:58.256
<i>with the disease,
Jack gave even more.</i>

25:03.017 --> 25:08.677
<i>Experts claimed his blood donation,
this passive immunization,</i>

25:08.754 --> 25:11.397
<i>is what saved his lover.</i>

25:19.744 --> 25:23.468
<i>But that doesn't explain the two
dozen other patients in that church</i>

25:23.545 --> 25:26.785
<i>who up and walked out,
healthy as oxen</i>

25:26.862 --> 25:28.584
<i>the day Jack died.</i>

25:31.530 --> 25:35.441
Those who pay attention know,
there were other forces at play.

25:35.518 --> 25:40.584
And it was because of Jack's
sacrifice that New Orleans lived on

25:40.661 --> 25:42.644
for one more song.

25:50.954 --> 25:55.416
It's gone. I just got it back,
I... I just got control,

25:55.493 --> 25:57.357
and now it's gone.

25:57.820 --> 25:59.732
So is Mina.

26:00.370 --> 26:01.959
I mean, she was the one
who was supposed

26:02.036 --> 26:03.311
to figure out
how to stop this thing,

26:03.388 --> 26:06.631
and now the whole city's running
wild with Ivan's Terrors.

26:06.780 --> 26:08.513
I don't know, Ty.

26:08.704 --> 26:10.485
I think we lost.

26:10.562 --> 26:12.161
I think you're right.

26:12.429 --> 26:14.193
So what happens now?

26:14.710 --> 26:18.263
What happens is you two are gonna
come at the problem and fix it.

26:18.631 --> 26:19.791
Somehow.

26:22.623 --> 26:25.615
But in the process,
one of you is going to die.

26:25.907 --> 26:28.495
Uh... Uh, I'm sorry,
can you repeat that last part?

26:28.572 --> 26:31.019
Every time the city's
been struck with a catastrophe,

26:31.096 --> 26:32.896
it's always come down
to two people.

26:33.045 --> 26:35.662
My auntie calls them
the divine pairing.

26:36.192 --> 26:39.661
It's always two,
since the stories began.

26:39.750 --> 26:41.958
Wait, those dolls on her
mantle, that's what they were?

26:42.035 --> 26:46.256
Yeah. And here are the latest
two editions to her display.

26:51.561 --> 26:53.598
Uh... No, this is ridiculous.

26:53.675 --> 26:55.187
Maybe not.

26:55.616 --> 26:58.175
Maybe that's why we've been
going through all this.

26:58.263 --> 27:00.027
Did you not hear the part
where we die?

27:00.104 --> 27:01.763
Not both of you.

27:02.078 --> 27:03.927
- Just one.
- Still!

27:04.008 --> 27:06.759
I know, okay? Listen, it's
on me to let you know

27:06.836 --> 27:08.305
what you're
going up against.

27:08.382 --> 27:10.765
The same way it's on you
to go up against it.

27:10.976 --> 27:14.556
Now, I'm sorry, I wish I could do
more to help you, I really do.

27:16.630 --> 27:18.450
Yeah, I know.

27:18.527 --> 27:19.837
I was in your head.

27:20.755 --> 27:24.405
Look, you should be
somewhere safe, okay?

27:24.482 --> 27:27.053
I needed
to tell you... everything.

27:27.130 --> 27:28.678
Evita, you got
to get out of here.

27:28.755 --> 27:31.303
You know this whole city
is tearing itself apart.

27:31.380 --> 27:33.787
I also know it's in good hands.

27:35.201 --> 27:39.576
Look, you've become...
You are important.

27:40.571 --> 27:42.256
And I don't
want to see you hurt.

27:43.023 --> 27:44.103
Okay?

27:55.162 --> 27:56.312
What?

27:57.219 --> 27:58.522
Nothing.

27:59.991 --> 28:02.545
I'll see you soon,
Tyrone Johnson.

28:14.382 --> 28:17.771
You know, on second throw,
I don't hate you two together.

28:17.960 --> 28:20.413
- Tandy...
- If the city doesn't destroy itself,

28:20.490 --> 28:22.420
you should lock that down.

28:22.903 --> 28:26.799
So, what are
we gonna do now?

28:26.876 --> 28:31.839
Um... we'll beeline past the CBD
and see if the parade's past

28:31.916 --> 28:33.584
and no Terrorizing
has gone down.

28:33.661 --> 28:36.402
Oh, I mean, there's got to be
hundreds of Terrors by now, right?

28:36.479 --> 28:38.709
Okay, then we deal., and we
go straight to the Core,

28:38.786 --> 28:41.086
and we stop it at the source,
just like we did at the rig.

28:41.163 --> 28:42.537
Ivan stopped the rig.

28:42.614 --> 28:45.354
We're not even sure stopping it
will make the Terrors go away.

28:45.431 --> 28:47.186
And I... I don't know
how good I'm gonna be

28:47.263 --> 28:50.310
now that my cloak is ripped
to shreds, it's useless.

28:50.422 --> 28:51.731
Look, I... I'm useless!

28:51.843 --> 28:54.553
Maybe the city picked
the wrong saviors this time.

28:56.729 --> 28:57.921
No.

28:59.290 --> 29:00.530
No, what?

29:00.607 --> 29:03.303
No... to this whole thing.

29:03.509 --> 29:06.909
This old you that I met,
hiding from his own shadow?

29:06.986 --> 29:09.532
Second-guessing every move
instead of actually moving,

29:09.609 --> 29:11.273
if this is the guy
that's gonna show up, Tyrone,

29:11.350 --> 29:12.363
we're both gonna die.

29:12.440 --> 29:13.637
Maybe that's who I am.

29:13.714 --> 29:16.023
Again, no.

29:16.611 --> 29:22.879
You are Tyrone freaking Johnson. Baller
lady-killer, master of space, if not time,

29:22.956 --> 29:25.186
and you don't need a cloak
for all of that.

29:27.666 --> 29:29.326
Look, what if I do?

29:35.654 --> 29:37.545
Well, then you can use this.

29:44.436 --> 29:45.857
Is that...?

29:45.938 --> 29:47.453
It is.

29:47.956 --> 29:49.067
How did you...?

29:49.144 --> 29:50.407
I stole it.

29:51.876 --> 29:53.556
From little you.

29:54.568 --> 29:57.084
It was the first thing
I ever stole.

29:58.351 --> 30:01.200
Why didn't you say anything
about his before?

30:01.328 --> 30:02.826
Because I needed it.

30:03.702 --> 30:05.172
I really needed it.

30:06.424 --> 30:08.053
And now?

30:08.264 --> 30:09.920
And now you need it.

30:10.271 --> 30:12.349
Even though you don't need it.

30:14.246 --> 30:15.896
But I need you.

30:23.291 --> 30:24.381
Okay.

30:25.432 --> 30:26.772
Okay.

30:33.705 --> 30:35.365
You ready to do this?

30:36.065 --> 30:37.104
Yeah.

30:40.795 --> 30:42.600
Oh, you were right.
This is the quickest way!

30:42.677 --> 30:45.077
There it is, right up there!
I think we finally got a path...

30:46.654 --> 30:47.820
luck.

30:52.718 --> 30:54.206
- Heh!
- Aah!

30:55.749 --> 30:57.006
- Heh!
- Aah!

30:57.083 --> 30:58.545
Aah!

30:58.631 --> 31:00.231
- Heh!
- Aah!

31:04.477 --> 31:06.207
Aah!

31:32.142 --> 31:33.749
- Shit.
- Yep.

31:42.913 --> 31:44.904
You just couldn't
leave it alone, could you?

31:44.981 --> 31:46.374
Well, what fun would that be?

31:59.058 --> 32:01.958
You should've stayed
in New York, bitch.

32:09.615 --> 32:12.958
<i>Auntie speaking French...</i>

32:36.171 --> 32:37.810
Amen.

32:38.086 --> 32:40.964
- You okay?
- No, I just...

32:41.041 --> 32:42.481
It stings a little.

32:47.327 --> 32:49.943
So... here we are.

32:50.126 --> 32:51.456
Yep.

32:52.524 --> 32:54.044
Here we are.

32:55.566 --> 32:57.559
Looks like O'Reilly
led me right to you.

32:57.636 --> 32:59.908
You really gonna try
to shoot at me again?

32:59.985 --> 33:03.130
No... fool me thrice.

33:03.381 --> 33:05.482
Your little side piece, though.

33:05.944 --> 33:08.872
I'm guessing she doesn't travel
as light as you.

33:14.204 --> 33:17.204
Nope, she doesn't.

33:18.638 --> 33:21.336
I'm not letting you
hold my life hostage anymore.

33:21.413 --> 33:23.720
Not my friends
or my family, you understand?

33:23.797 --> 33:25.350
Listen, you little...

33:32.956 --> 33:35.141
I'm not afraid
of you anymore.

33:35.398 --> 33:36.527
Are you?

33:36.604 --> 33:37.885
Yeah.

33:38.233 --> 33:39.821
You should be.

33:40.529 --> 33:44.766
You should be very...
very... afraid.

33:45.783 --> 33:47.259
You afraid?

33:47.702 --> 33:48.912
I am.

34:17.916 --> 34:19.291
You okay?

34:19.757 --> 34:22.297
Like I said before, if I had a
knife of light I'd kill him,

34:22.375 --> 34:25.516
but... I don't.

34:26.451 --> 34:29.000
No, but you have the power
to be wherever you want.

34:33.103 --> 34:35.196
Or wherever I'm supposed to be.

34:45.074 --> 34:46.434
in order for us
to stop this.

34:46.511 --> 34:48.632
Yeah, but nobody says
that has to be you.

34:48.708 --> 34:50.070
Fate does!

so I can get there first.

34:53.775 --> 34:55.000
No.

34:55.257 --> 34:56.821
No. This is bullshit.
You can't...

One of us has to.

35:53.046 --> 35:54.850
Aah!

36:02.960 --> 36:04.623
Then we both have to.

36:04.709 --> 36:06.907
For some reason,
life tossed us together

36:06.984 --> 36:09.916
and mixed up our mojo, so if
it's on you, it's on me, too,

36:09.993 --> 36:11.264
I know that.

36:11.341 --> 36:13.765
Shit, Ty, sometimes it's the
only thing that I know.

36:13.842 --> 36:17.019
And this swirling ball of scary
down here is probably nothing

36:17.096 --> 36:19.505
