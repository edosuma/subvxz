KATARA: <i>Water...</i>

00:04.840 --> 00:06.090
<i>Earth...</i>

00:06.670 --> 00:07.970
<i>Fire...</i>

00:09.050 --> 00:10.300
<i>Air...</i>

00:11.050 --> 00:14.520
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

00:15.270 --> 00:18.770
<i>Then, everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

00:19.600 --> 00:22.440
<i>Only the Avatar,
master of all four elements,</i>

00:22.520 --> 00:23.650
<i>could stop them.</i>

00:23.730 --> 00:25.530
<i>But when the world needed him most,</i>

00:25.610 --> 00:26.780
<i>he vanished.</i>

00:27.240 --> 00:29.240
<i>A hundred years passed,
and my brother and I</i>

00:29.320 --> 00:32.620
<i>discovered the new Avatar,
an airbender named Aang.</i>

00:32.950 --> 00:35.080
<i>And although his airbending
skills were great,</i>

00:35.160 --> 00:38.580
<i>he has a lot to learn
before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

00:38.960 --> 00:42.090
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

01:01.520 --> 01:03.990
Let's go, Appa! Come on, boy.

01:04.070 --> 01:05.400
( GRUNTING )

01:06.070 --> 01:08.200
Look, I'm sorry, but Katara and Sokka

01:08.280 --> 01:10.080
aren't coming
to the Fire Nation with us.

01:10.700 --> 01:13.250
If they got hurt,
I'd never forgive myself.

01:13.950 --> 01:16.290
So get your big butt
off the ground and let's go!

01:16.370 --> 01:17.460
Uhh...

01:17.540 --> 01:18.880
Aah!

01:19.210 --> 01:20.210
SOKKA: I think his big butt

01:20.290 --> 01:21.380
is trying to tell you something.

01:21.750 --> 01:23.260
KATARA: Please don't go, Aang.

01:23.340 --> 01:25.880
The world can't afford to lose you
to the Fire Nation.

01:26.380 --> 01:27.470
Neither can I.

01:32.810 --> 01:34.560
But I have to talk to Avatar Roku

01:34.640 --> 01:36.020
to find out what my vision means.

01:36.350 --> 01:38.140
I need to get to the fire temple

01:38.230 --> 01:39.850
before the sun sets on the solstice.

01:40.190 --> 01:41.310
That's today!

01:44.650 --> 01:47.530
We're not letting you
go into the Fire Nation, Aang.

01:48.410 --> 01:50.280
At least not without your friends.

01:50.370 --> 01:51.530
We got your back.

01:54.700 --> 01:55.750
Ew!

01:55.830 --> 01:58.210
It's a long journey
to the crescent island.

01:58.620 --> 02:00.380
You'll have to fly fast
to have any chance

02:00.460 --> 02:02.250
of making it before sundown.

02:02.880 --> 02:03.880
Good luck.

02:03.960 --> 02:04.960
Thank you for your―

02:05.050 --> 02:06.050
Go!

02:06.130 --> 02:07.130
( GRUNT )

02:10.840 --> 02:11.930
Ah.

02:12.680 --> 02:13.890
Having trouble sleeping?

02:13.970 --> 02:14.970
Uh!

02:16.560 --> 02:18.230
Seen the Avatar lately?

02:27.240 --> 02:29.450
Come on, boy.
We've got a long way to go.

02:29.530 --> 02:30.530
Faster!

02:30.610 --> 02:32.280
( GRUNT )

02:36.370 --> 02:38.910
Sailing into Fire Nation waters.

02:39.830 --> 02:41.790
Of all the foolish things you've done

02:41.880 --> 02:44.590
in your 16 years, Prince Zuko,

02:44.670 --> 02:47.300
this is the most foolish.

02:47.380 --> 02:48.840
I have no choice, uncle.

02:49.380 --> 02:51.010
Have you completely forgotten

02:51.090 --> 02:53.550
that the Fire Lord banished you?

02:54.050 --> 02:55.260
What if you're caught?

02:55.560 --> 02:57.270
I'm chasing the Avatar.

02:57.350 --> 02:59.230
My father will understand
why I'm returning home.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.810
You give him too much credit.

03:01.900 --> 03:04.520
My brother is not
the understanding type.

03:08.230 --> 03:09.610
There they are.

03:09.820 --> 03:11.530
Helmsman, full steam ahead.

03:13.530 --> 03:15.200
Aang, we got trouble.

03:15.280 --> 03:17.160
Yeah, and it's gaining fast!

03:24.580 --> 03:27.960
Really, Prince Zuko,
couldn't you shoot them down

03:28.050 --> 03:29.550
with something more fragrant?

03:30.550 --> 03:31.550
Huh!

03:32.840 --> 03:34.300
On my mark.

03:34.590 --> 03:35.600
Fire!

03:38.390 --> 03:39.850
Fire ball!

03:39.930 --> 03:40.930
I'm on it!

03:44.940 --> 03:46.770
We have to get out of Zuko's range

03:46.860 --> 03:49.110
before he shoots
another hotsticker at us!

03:49.320 --> 03:51.110
Can't you make Appa go any faster?

03:51.570 --> 03:53.910
Yeah, but there's
just one little problem.

03:54.530 --> 03:55.660
A blockade.

04:02.620 --> 04:03.960
Technically, you are still

04:04.040 --> 04:05.500
in Earth Kingdom waters.

04:05.580 --> 04:07.750
Turn back now,
and they cannot arrest you.

04:08.210 --> 04:09.210
If we fly north,

04:09.300 --> 04:10.800
we can go around the Fire Nation ships

04:10.880 --> 04:12.220
and avoid the blockade.

04:12.470 --> 04:13.680
It's the only way.

04:13.760 --> 04:15.390
KATARA: There's no time!

04:15.470 --> 04:17.350
This is exactly why
I didn't want you to come.

04:17.430 --> 04:18.930
It's too dangerous.

04:19.010 --> 04:20.770
And that's exactly why we're here.

04:20.850 --> 04:22.600
Let's run this blockade.

04:23.390 --> 04:24.560
Appa, yip yip!

04:24.890 --> 04:26.190
( APPA GRUNTS )

04:27.400 --> 04:28.690
He's not turning around.

04:28.770 --> 04:32.360
Please, Prince Zuko.
If the Fire Nation captures you,

04:32.440 --> 04:34.360
There is nothing I can do.

04:34.450 --> 04:36.530
Do not follow the Avatar.

04:37.160 --> 04:38.410
I'm sorry, uncle.

04:39.240 --> 04:40.830
Run the blockade!

04:41.660 --> 04:43.410
ZHAO: The Avatar...

04:44.120 --> 04:46.330
And the banished prince.

04:46.920 --> 04:49.460
This must be my lucky day.

04:49.540 --> 04:51.840
Commander Zhao, what are your orders?

04:51.920 --> 04:54.050
Shoot the bison down, captain.

04:54.130 --> 04:57.090
But there's a fire navy ship
out there, sir― One of our own.

04:57.180 --> 04:58.220
What if it's hit?

04:58.300 --> 05:00.850
So be it. It belongs to a traitor.

05:01.390 --> 05:02.390
Ignite!

05:05.890 --> 05:06.900
Launch!

05:10.940 --> 05:12.280
Aah! Aah! Aah!

05:29.210 --> 05:30.540
Appa, are you ok?

05:31.290 --> 05:32.550
( GRUNT )

05:44.970 --> 05:47.230
Prince Zuko, the engines are damaged!

05:47.310 --> 05:49.520
We need to stop and make repairs!

05:49.850 --> 05:51.650
Do not stop this ship.

05:52.190 --> 05:53.190
Launch!

05:58.700 --> 06:00.990
Aah!

06:06.790 --> 06:08.580
( GRUNT )

06:08.670 --> 06:11.040
Aah! Aah! Aah!

06:12.170 --> 06:13.340
Aah!

06:14.300 --> 06:16.460
Sokka!

06:18.680 --> 06:20.590
Aah!

06:22.350 --> 06:23.350
Aah!

06:26.470 --> 06:27.480
Oh!

06:38.150 --> 06:39.320
Ready.

06:44.120 --> 06:45.120
Fire!

06:48.160 --> 06:49.790
Aah!

06:53.420 --> 06:54.420
Huh!

06:58.460 --> 07:00.550
Aah! Ooh!

07:06.930 --> 07:08.020
We made it!

07:08.100 --> 07:10.890
We got into the Fire Nation. Great.

07:11.480 --> 07:13.520
Where do you think
the Avatar is headed, sir?

07:13.610 --> 07:15.520
I'm not sure,

07:15.610 --> 07:18.230
but I bet a certain
banished prince will know.

07:21.110 --> 07:22.610
We're on a collision course!

07:22.700 --> 07:23.870
We can make it.

07:24.370 --> 07:27.240
The boarding party is ready
to apprehend Prince Zuko, sir.

07:27.620 --> 07:29.540
Wait. Cut the engines

07:29.620 --> 07:30.830
and let them pass.

07:30.910 --> 07:31.910
Sir?

07:45.010 --> 07:46.100
( APPA SNORING )

07:53.940 --> 07:54.940
There it is―

07:55.650 --> 07:57.690
The island
where Roku's dragon took me.

08:03.200 --> 08:05.320
You did it, buddy. Nice flying.

08:05.530 --> 08:06.780
( SNORING )

08:06.870 --> 08:08.910
Oh, you must be tired.

08:08.990 --> 08:14.790
No, I'm good. Refreshed and ready
to fight some firebenders.

08:14.870 --> 08:16.750
I was talking to Appa.

08:17.340 --> 08:19.550
Well, I was talking to Momo.

08:27.510 --> 08:28.970
SOKKA: I don't see any guards.

08:29.060 --> 08:30.060
KATARA: The Fire Nation

08:30.140 --> 08:31.180
must have abandoned the temple

08:31.270 --> 08:32.600
when Avatar Roku died.

08:32.890 --> 08:34.940
It's almost sundown.
We'd better hurry.

08:44.860 --> 08:47.660
Wait. I think I heard something.

08:48.700 --> 08:54.710
We are the fire sages,
guardians of the temple of the Avatar.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.870
Great. I am the Avatar.

08:57.460 --> 08:58.460
We know.

09:04.550 --> 09:06.050
I'll hold them off. Run!

09:08.800 --> 09:10.350
Uh! Uh! Uh!

09:10.890 --> 09:13.390
If the Avatar contacts Roku,

09:13.470 --> 09:15.850
there's no telling how powerful
the boy will become.

09:15.940 --> 09:17.690
Split up and find him.

09:21.610 --> 09:22.610
Follow me!

09:22.690 --> 09:23.740
Do you know where you're going?

09:24.030 --> 09:25.030
Nope.

09:26.740 --> 09:28.200
Wrong way!

09:28.820 --> 09:29.910
SHYU: Come back!

09:35.830 --> 09:38.750
I don't want to fight you.
I am a friend.

09:39.250 --> 09:41.040
Firebenders aren't our friends.

09:43.880 --> 09:46.050
I know why you're here, Avatar.

09:46.130 --> 09:47.260
You do?

09:47.340 --> 09:50.640
Yes. You wish to speak to Avatar Roku.

09:51.300 --> 09:52.850
I can take you to him.

09:52.930 --> 09:53.930
How?

09:56.270 --> 09:57.270
Uh!

09:59.650 --> 10:00.650
This way.

10:01.440 --> 10:02.440
MAN: Find him!

10:03.860 --> 10:05.440
Time is running out! Quickly!

10:14.410 --> 10:16.080
What's he up to, uncle?

10:16.160 --> 10:18.210
Why didn't Commander Zhao arrest me?

10:18.290 --> 10:20.670
Because he wants to follow you.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.080
He knows you'll lead him

10:22.170 --> 10:24.380
to the prize you're both after―

10:24.460 --> 10:25.590
The Avatar.

10:26.300 --> 10:28.300
If Zhao wants to follow
our trail of smoke,

10:28.380 --> 10:30.590
then that's exactly
what I'll let him do.

10:31.390 --> 10:34.010
SHYU: Avatar Roku once called
this temple his home.

10:34.510 --> 10:37.600
He formed these secret passages
out of the magma.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.480
AANG: Did you know Avatar Roku?

10:39.560 --> 10:42.190
No, but my grandfather knew him.

10:42.810 --> 10:44.650
Many generations of fire sages

10:44.730 --> 10:47.320
guarded this temple long before me.

10:47.400 --> 10:49.530
We all have a strong
spiritual connection

10:49.610 --> 10:51.030
to this place.

10:51.110 --> 10:52.570
Is that how you knew I was coming?

10:52.950 --> 10:56.040
A few weeks ago,
an amazing thing occurred.

10:56.120 --> 10:58.250
The statue of Avatar Roku―

10:58.870 --> 11:00.670
Its eyes began to glow.

11:00.750 --> 11:02.670
KATARA: That's when we were
at the air temple.

11:02.750 --> 11:05.380
Avatar Roku's eyes
were glowing there, too.

11:05.460 --> 11:09.130
At that moment,
we knew you had returned to the world.

11:09.670 --> 11:11.630
If this is the Avatar's temple,

11:11.720 --> 11:13.390
why did the sages attack me?

11:13.470 --> 11:15.220
Things have changed.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.930
In the past, the sages were loyal

11:17.010 --> 11:18.640
only to the Avatar.

11:19.180 --> 11:23.940
When Roku died, the sages eagerly
awaited for the next Avatar to return,

11:24.360 --> 11:25.820
but he never came.

11:26.230 --> 11:27.780
They were waiting for me.

11:27.860 --> 11:30.570
Hey, don't feel bad.
You're only 100 years late.

11:30.990 --> 11:33.530
They lost hope that the Avatar
would ever return.

11:33.950 --> 11:36.620
When Fire Lord Sozin began the war,

11:36.700 --> 11:38.620
my grandfather and the other sages

11:38.700 --> 11:40.870
were forced to follow him.

11:40.960 --> 11:43.670
I never wanted to serve the Fire Lord.

11:44.290 --> 11:46.040
When I learned you were coming,

11:46.130 --> 11:48.550
I knew I would have to
betray the other sages.

11:48.960 --> 11:50.170
Thank you for helping me.

11:52.630 --> 11:54.470
We'll follow these stairs
to the sanctuary.

11:55.390 --> 11:56.890
Once you're inside,

11:56.970 --> 11:59.890
wait for the light to hit
Avatar Roku's statue.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.690
Only then will you be
able to speak with him.

12:10.690 --> 12:11.690
( GASP )

12:11.780 --> 12:12.780
No!

12:13.450 --> 12:15.160
Shyu, what's wrong?

12:15.450 --> 12:18.370
The sanctuary doors― They're closed.

12:18.450 --> 12:20.660
Can't you just open them
with firebending,

12:20.750 --> 12:22.200
like you opened that other door?

12:22.620 --> 12:26.040
SHYU: No. Only a fully realized Avatar

12:26.130 --> 12:28.500
is powerful enough
to open this door alone.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.920
Otherwise, the sages must
open the doors together

12:32.260 --> 12:35.300
with five simultaneous fire blasts.

12:35.720 --> 12:37.390
Five fire blasts, huh?

12:37.470 --> 12:38.680
( DING )

12:38.760 --> 12:40.220
I think I can help you out.

12:42.890 --> 12:44.440
ZUKO: Uncle, keep heading north.

12:44.810 --> 12:46.310
Zhao will follow the smoke trail

12:46.400 --> 12:47.980
while I use it as a cover.

12:48.060 --> 12:49.610
Hmmm.

12:57.820 --> 12:58.820
SOKKA: This is a little trick

12:58.910 --> 13:00.240
I picked up from my father.

13:00.580 --> 13:03.620
I seal the lamp oil inside
an animal skin casing.

13:04.040 --> 13:05.920
Shyu lights the oil-soaked twine,

13:06.000 --> 13:07.080
and ta da!

13:07.170 --> 13:08.540
Fake firebending.

13:09.040 --> 13:11.170
You're really outdone yourself
this time, Sokka.

13:11.250 --> 13:13.260
This might actually work.

13:16.130 --> 13:17.680
The sages will hear the explosion,

13:17.760 --> 13:19.760
so as soon as they go off,
you rush in.

13:22.520 --> 13:24.520
It's almost sunset. Are you ready?

13:24.600 --> 13:25.690
Definitely.

13:34.240 --> 13:35.240
Ooh!

13:40.490 --> 13:41.580
Uh! Uh!

13:41.660 --> 13:42.700
They're still locked!

13:46.500 --> 13:48.170
It didn't work.

13:58.220 --> 14:02.180
Why won't it open?! Uh!

14:02.930 --> 14:04.640
Aang, stop.

14:04.970 --> 14:06.480
There's nothing else we can do.

14:06.560 --> 14:09.520
I'm sorry I put you
through all this for nothing.

14:09.600 --> 14:10.690
SOKKA: I don't get it.

14:11.270 --> 14:12.650
That blast looked as strong

14:12.730 --> 14:14.280
as any firebending I've seen.

14:15.190 --> 14:17.610
Sokka, you're a genius!

14:17.700 --> 14:19.610
Wait. How is Sokka a genius?

14:19.700 --> 14:21.030
His plan didn't even work.

14:21.530 --> 14:23.580
Come on, Aang. Let her dream.

14:24.120 --> 14:27.200
You're right.
Sokka's plan didn't work,

14:27.290 --> 14:29.370
but it looks like it did.

14:29.620 --> 14:31.210
Did the definition of genius change

14:31.290 --> 14:32.920
in the last 100 years?

14:33.840 --> 14:36.630
SHYU: Come quickly!
The Avatar has entered the sanctuary!

14:36.710 --> 14:38.010
How did he get in?

14:38.090 --> 14:40.590
I know, but look at the scorch marks,

14:40.680 --> 14:41.680
and down there.

14:43.760 --> 14:47.020
He's inside.
Open the doors immediately

14:47.390 --> 14:50.440
before he contacts Avatar Roku.

14:52.980 --> 14:54.190
- Huh!
- Huh!

15:03.700 --> 15:04.780
( SNEEZE )

15:04.870 --> 15:06.410
It's the Avatar's lemur.

15:06.700 --> 15:08.830
He must have crawled
through the pipes.

15:08.910 --> 15:10.120
We've been tricked!

15:10.210 --> 15:11.290
-( YOWLING )
- Aah!

15:14.540 --> 15:15.540
Now, Aang.

15:17.340 --> 15:18.840
Aang, now's your chance!

15:21.220 --> 15:23.220
The Avatar's coming with me.

15:23.300 --> 15:25.470
Uh! Uh!

15:25.550 --> 15:27.260
Uh!

15:28.020 --> 15:29.640
Close the doors, quickly!

15:35.190 --> 15:36.770
- Uh!
- Aah!

15:37.480 --> 15:38.480
Go!

15:45.870 --> 15:46.870
He made it!

15:59.760 --> 16:02.260
The light hits the statue,
and I talk to Roku.

16:02.340 --> 16:03.840
So why isn't anything happening?

16:05.090 --> 16:06.100
- Huh!
- Huh!

16:09.470 --> 16:11.770
Why isn't it working?
It's sealed shut.

16:11.850 --> 16:13.600
It must have been the light.

16:13.690 --> 16:16.270
Avatar Roku doesn't want us inside.

16:19.020 --> 16:20.860
AANG: Why isn't anything happening?

16:21.570 --> 16:22.990
I don't know what I'm doing.

16:23.070 --> 16:24.530
All I know is airbending.

16:24.610 --> 16:26.620
Please, Avatar Roku, talk to me.

16:34.500 --> 16:36.540
It's good to see you, Aang.

16:37.210 --> 16:39.130
What took you so long?

16:43.840 --> 16:45.590
ZUKO: Why did you help the Avatar?

16:45.680 --> 16:48.390
Because it was once the sage's duty.

16:48.890 --> 16:51.430
It is still our duty.

16:51.640 --> 16:52.980
( ONE PERSON CLAPPING )

16:55.230 --> 16:58.520
What a moving
and heartfelt performance.

16:59.360 --> 17:01.780
I'm certain the Fire Lord
will understand

17:01.860 --> 17:04.610
when you explain why you betrayed him.

17:04.700 --> 17:05.950
Commander Zhao―

17:06.530 --> 17:08.030
ZHAO: And, Prince Zuko,

17:08.120 --> 17:10.240
it was a noble effort,

17:10.330 --> 17:13.330
but your little smokescreen
didn't work.

17:13.660 --> 17:16.210
Two traitors in one day.

17:16.290 --> 17:18.330
The Fire Lord will be pleased.

17:18.630 --> 17:20.130
You're too late, Zhao.

17:20.210 --> 17:21.590
The Avatar's inside,

17:21.670 --> 17:22.670
and the doors are sealed.

17:23.050 --> 17:25.760
No matter. Sooner or later,

17:25.840 --> 17:27.470
he has to come out.

17:31.430 --> 17:35.270
I have something very important
to tell you, Aang.

17:35.600 --> 17:39.860
That is why,
when you were in the spirit world,

17:39.940 --> 17:42.190
I sent my dragon to find you.

17:42.570 --> 17:44.030
Is it about that vision―

17:44.110 --> 17:45.110
The one of the comet?

17:45.360 --> 17:46.450
Yes.

17:46.530 --> 17:47.660
What does it mean?

17:47.950 --> 17:50.030
100 years ago,

17:50.120 --> 17:52.410
Fire Lord Sozin used that comet

17:52.490 --> 17:54.160
to begin the war.

17:54.250 --> 17:56.710
He and his firebending army

17:56.790 --> 17:59.040
harnessed its incredible power

17:59.120 --> 18:01.040
and dealt a deadly first strike

18:01.130 --> 18:03.130
against the other nations.

18:03.210 --> 18:05.260
So the comet made them stronger?

18:05.670 --> 18:09.390
Yes, stronger than you
could even imagine.

18:09.590 --> 18:11.430
But that happened a hundred years ago.

18:11.510 --> 18:13.720
What does the comet
have to do with the war now?

18:13.810 --> 18:15.140
Listen carefully.

18:15.890 --> 18:19.190
Sozin's Comet will return
by the end of this summer,

18:19.270 --> 18:21.860
and Fire Lord Ozai will use its power

18:21.940 --> 18:24.780
to finish the war once and for all.

18:24.860 --> 18:26.570
Aah!

18:27.320 --> 18:29.910
If he succeeds, even the Avatar

18:29.990 --> 18:32.910
won't be able to restore
balance to the world.

18:32.990 --> 18:36.540
Aang, you must defeat the Fire Lord

18:36.620 --> 18:38.580
before the comet arrives.

18:39.040 --> 18:41.040
But I haven't even started
learning waterbending,

18:41.130 --> 18:43.040
not to mention earth and fire.

18:43.130 --> 18:47.260
Mastering the elements takes years
of discipline and practice,

18:47.590 --> 18:49.800
But if the world is to survive,

18:49.880 --> 18:52.590
you must do it by summer's end.

19:00.560 --> 19:02.400
ZHAO: When those doors open,

19:02.480 --> 19:04.820
unleash all your firepower.

19:05.230 --> 19:07.070
How's Aang gonna make it out of this?

19:07.150 --> 19:08.490
How are we gonna make it out of this?

19:11.700 --> 19:13.910
What if I can't master
all the elements in time?

19:13.990 --> 19:15.160
What if I fail?

19:15.240 --> 19:17.290
I know you can do it, Aang,

19:17.700 --> 19:20.710
for you have done it before.

19:21.080 --> 19:23.330
The solstice is ending.

19:23.420 --> 19:27.840
We must go our separate ways for now.

19:27.920 --> 19:29.970
But I won't be able
to come back to the temple.

19:30.340 --> 19:31.840
What if I have questions?

19:31.930 --> 19:33.050
How will I talk to you?

19:33.430 --> 19:35.930
I am a part of you.

19:36.010 --> 19:38.890
When you need to talk to me again,

19:38.970 --> 19:41.190
you will find a way.

19:43.190 --> 19:46.400
A great danger awaits you
at the temple.

19:47.270 --> 19:49.690
I can help you face the threat,

19:49.780 --> 19:51.400
But only if you are ready.

19:53.660 --> 19:54.660
I'm ready.

20:05.330 --> 20:06.630
ZHAO: Ready...

20:07.960 --> 20:09.380
No! Aang!

20:09.920 --> 20:10.920
Fire!

20:17.640 --> 20:18.930
Avatar Roku!

20:21.890 --> 20:22.890
- Uh!
- Uh!

20:24.440 --> 20:25.440
Uh!

20:30.030 --> 20:31.440
- Oh!
- Oh!

20:31.530 --> 20:33.450
Avatar Roku is going to
destroy the temple.

20:33.530 --> 20:34.910
We have to get out of here!

20:34.990 --> 20:36.240
Not without Aang!

20:36.780 --> 20:37.780
Huh!

21:07.020 --> 21:08.270
We got your back.

21:08.690 --> 21:10.520
Thanks. Where's Shyu?

21:10.610 --> 21:11.610
I don't know.

21:16.740 --> 21:17.820
Uh! Uh! Uh!

21:21.620 --> 21:22.620
( GASPS )

21:37.470 --> 21:40.220
No prince, no Avatar.

21:40.350 --> 21:42.430
Apparently the only thing I do have

21:42.680 --> 21:44.270
is five traitors.

21:44.350 --> 21:47.020
But, Commander,
only Shyu helped the Avatar.

21:47.190 --> 21:49.400
Save your stories for the Fire Lord.

21:49.690 --> 21:51.400
As far as I'm concerned,

21:51.480 --> 21:53.360
you are all guilty.

21:53.650 --> 21:55.110
Take them to the prison hold!
