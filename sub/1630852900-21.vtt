WEBVTT

00:36.266 --> 00:37.966
WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:38.033 --> 00:38.366
WELCOME TO

00:38.433 --> 00:38.933
TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT"!

00:39.000 --> 00:39.300
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:39.366 --> 00:39.900
THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.

00:39.966 --> 00:40.400
IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK.

00:40.466 --> 00:40.866
JOE BIDEN SIGNED THE

00:40.933 --> 00:41.533
INFLATION REDUCTION ACT,

00:41.600 --> 00:42.366
THE C-D-C ANNOUNCED A MAJOR

00:42.433 --> 00:45.000
REOGANIZATION, AND THE FALLOUT

00:45.066 --> 00:46.700
FROM THE FBI SEARCH AT MAR A

00:46.766 --> 00:47.600
LAGO CONTINUED, WITH TRUMP'S

00:47.666 --> 00:48.233
ASSOCIATES SPINNING INCREASINGLY

00:48.300 --> 00:48.866
OUTLANDISH RATIONALIZATIONS FOR

00:48.933 --> 00:50.533
WHY IT WAS OKAY FOR HIM TO KEEP

00:50.600 --> 00:54.733
SENSITIVE DOCUMENTS THERE,

00:54.800 --> 00:55.466
INCLUDING THIS ONE.

00:55.533 --> 00:56.500
>> REALLY, IF YOU LOOK AT THE

00:56.566 --> 00:58.466
ESPIONAGE ACT, IT'S NOT REALLY

00:58.533 --> 01:00.833
ABOUT TAKING THE DOCUMENTS, IT'S

01:00.900 --> 01:01.500
ABOUT DESTROYING THEM, OR HIDING

01:01.566 --> 01:02.300
THEM, OR GIVING THEM TO THE

01:02.366 --> 01:07.300
ENEMY.

01:07.366 --> 01:08.100
IT'S NOT ABOUT TAKING THEM AND

01:08.166 --> 01:10.433
PUTTING THEM IN A PLACE THAT'S

01:10.500 --> 01:11.066
ROUGHLY AS SAFE AS THEY WERE IN

01:11.133 --> 01:13.266
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

01:13.333 --> 01:15.100
LOOK, PUTTING ASIDE

01:15.166 --> 01:18.333
RUDY WALKING RIGHT UP TO THE

01:18.400 --> 01:18.933
LINE OF PLEADING GUILTY ON

01:19.000 --> 01:19.766
TRUMP'S BEHALF -- IF YOU'RE

01:19.833 --> 01:21.333
COMPARING THE SECURITY OF TWO

01:21.400 --> 01:22.700
PLACES, THE TWO WORST EXAMPLES

01:22.766 --> 01:24.766
WOULD BE THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE

01:24.833 --> 01:26.233
FLORIDA RESORT WHERE A FAILED

01:26.300 --> 01:27.366
BACHELORETTE CONTESTANT ACTUALLY

01:27.433 --> 01:29.666
CLAIMED ON INSTAGRAM,

01:29.733 --> 01:30.933
"I SNOOPED AROUND PRETTY DANG

01:31.000 --> 01:32.966
FREELY AND THE SECRET SECURITY

01:33.033 --> 01:34.700
WASN'T TOO WORRIED ABOUT WHICH

01:34.766 --> 01:35.333
ROOM I WENT IN."

01:35.400 --> 01:37.166
AND IT'S NOT EXACTLY A SECURE

01:37.233 --> 01:38.400
STORAGE FACILITY IF

01:38.466 --> 01:40.233
YOUTH PASTOR RYAN REYNOLDS HERE

01:40.300 --> 01:43.066
CAN JUST WANDER AROUND.

01:43.133 --> 01:43.966
BUT WE'RE GOING TO START WITH

01:44.033 --> 01:45.066
THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS.

01:45.133 --> 01:45.966
MORE PRIMARIES TOOK PLACE THIS

01:46.033 --> 01:48.100
WEEK.

01:48.166 --> 01:49.333
IN WYOMING, REPUBLICANS

01:49.400 --> 01:50.300
OVERWHELMINGLY VOTED OUT

01:50.366 --> 01:51.533
LIZ CHENEY, DESPITE HER FATHER'S

01:51.600 --> 01:52.433
LAST-MINUTE EMPEROR

01:52.500 --> 01:54.466
PALPATINE-LIKE ENDORSEMENT.

01:54.533 --> 01:55.233
AND IN ALASKA, A LOT'S BEEN

01:55.300 --> 01:57.400
HAPPENING.

01:57.466 --> 01:58.766
THEY HAVE OPEN PRIMARIES, WHERE

01:58.833 --> 02:00.766
THE TOP FOUR FINISHERS,

02:00.833 --> 02:01.966
REGARDLESS OF PARTY, GO ON TO

02:02.033 --> 02:02.866
THE GENERAL ELECTION.

02:02.933 --> 02:05.300
SO, ON THE SENATE SIDE, THERE'LL

02:05.366 --> 02:06.400
BE AT LEAST TWO REPUBLICANS ON

02:06.466 --> 02:08.033
SITTING

02:08.100 --> 02:10.266
SENATOR LISA MURKOWSKI, AND THE

02:10.333 --> 02:10.933
MORE EXTREME KELLY TSHIBAKA, WHO

02:11.000 --> 02:13.433
NOT ONLY QUESTIONS THE 2020

02:13.500 --> 02:15.066
ELECTION RESULTS, BUT ALSO, PUTS

02:15.133 --> 02:16.766
OUT ALLITERATION-HEAVY ADS LIKE

02:16.833 --> 02:17.200
THIS.

02:17.266 --> 02:20.000
>> TOGETHER, I'M CONFIDENT THAT

02:20.066 --> 02:21.766
WE CAN BLOCK JOE BIDEN'S

02:21.833 --> 02:22.700
BUSINESS-BUSTING,

02:22.766 --> 02:24.666
CRIME-CASCADING,

02:24.733 --> 02:26.700
DEFENSE-DECIMATING,

02:26.766 --> 02:28.200
ENERGY-ANNIHILATING,

02:28.266 --> 02:29.600
FREEDOM-FLATTENING,

02:29.666 --> 02:31.000
GUN-GRABBING,

02:31.066 --> 02:32.566
MANDATE-MILITATING,

02:32.633 --> 02:33.533
PARENT-PUNISHING,

02:33.600 --> 02:34.766
POLICE-PERSECUTING,

02:34.833 --> 02:36.600
SOCIALIST-SYMPATHIZING,

02:36.666 --> 02:40.833
AMERICA-OBLITERATING AGENDA.

02:40.900 --> 02:42.500
OKAY, I HAVE A MILLION

02:42.566 --> 02:43.800
PROBLEMS WITH THAT.

02:43.866 --> 02:44.433
"CRIME CASCADING" DOESN'T

02:44.500 --> 02:45.166
WORK.

02:45.233 --> 02:46.400
CASCADING DOESN'T REALLY TAKE A

02:46.466 --> 02:48.366
DIRECT OBJECT LIKE THAT.

02:48.433 --> 02:49.400
"ENERGY" AND

02:49.466 --> 02:50.033
"ANNIHILATING" DON'T START WITH

02:50.100 --> 02:50.933
THE SAME LETTER.

02:51.000 --> 02:51.866
WHICH IS WEIRD, BECAUSE THERE

02:51.933 --> 02:53.200
ARE TONS OF OTHER OPTIONS FOR

02:53.266 --> 02:53.700
"E" -- "EXTINGUISHING",

02:53.766 --> 02:55.200
"EXTERMINATING", EVEN JUST A

02:55.266 --> 02:55.733
SIMPLE "ENDING" IF YOU'RE

02:55.800 --> 02:57.033
FEELING LAZY.

02:57.100 --> 02:58.200
THEN THERE'S

02:58.266 --> 02:59.066
"MANDATE MILITATING", WHICH

02:59.133 --> 03:00.366
MAKES NO SENSE AND I'M NOT EVEN

03:00.433 --> 03:01.066
GOING TO TRY AND EXPLAIN IT.

03:01.133 --> 03:02.166
AND OF COURSE THE GRAND FINALE

03:02.233 --> 03:04.033
OF "AMERICA OBLITERATING

03:04.100 --> 03:04.800
AGENDA"?

03:04.866 --> 03:07.233
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING

03:07.300 --> 03:08.633
GOING "A" TO "O" TO "A" THERE?

03:08.700 --> 03:09.466
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE A GREAT

03:09.533 --> 03:10.533
REPLACEMENT FOR "OBLITERATING"

03:10.600 --> 03:11.166
IN THIS SITUATION?

03:11.233 --> 03:12.533
"ANNIHILATING."

03:12.600 --> 03:13.333
BUT IT'S TOO LATE, BECAUSE YOU

03:13.400 --> 03:14.600
BLEW THAT ONE RIGHT AT THE

03:14.666 --> 03:16.200
START.

03:16.266 --> 03:20.166
OTHER THAN THAT, NO NOTES.

03:20.766 --> 03:21.500
ALASKANS ALSO VOTED IN A SPECIAL

03:21.566 --> 03:22.133
ELECTION THIS WEEK, TO FILL A

03:22.200 --> 03:23.966
VACANT HOUSE SEAT, AND FOR

03:24.033 --> 03:25.500
"THAT" ONE, THEY GOT TO USE

03:25.566 --> 03:26.933
RANKED-CHOICE VOTING FOR THE

03:27.000 --> 03:28.400
FIRST TIME, WHICH THEIR LOCAL

03:28.466 --> 03:28.933
NEWS EXPLAINED IN THE MOST

03:30.866 --> 03:32.133
>> IMAGINE ELK, POLAR BEAR,

03:32.200 --> 03:34.133
PENGUIN, AND OWL ARE RUNNING FOR

03:34.200 --> 03:35.733
OFFICE.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.266
YOU PREFER ELK, AND YOU'RE

03:37.333 --> 03:38.766
DEFINITELY ANTI-PENGUIN.

03:38.833 --> 03:40.333
SO MAYBE YOU'LL FILL OUT YOUR

03:40.400 --> 03:43.333
ELK, POLAR

03:43.400 --> 03:45.066
BEAR, OWL, AND PENGUIN.

03:45.133 --> 03:46.966
YOU COULD ALSO CHOOSE TO ONLY

03:47.033 --> 03:48.000
PARTIALLY FILL OUT THE BALLOT,

03:48.066 --> 03:49.033
AND JUST LEAVE OFF PENGUIN

03:49.100 --> 03:50.966
ENTIRELY.

03:51.033 --> 03:51.700
EXCELLENT.

03:51.766 --> 03:53.000
I LOVE SO MUCH THERE, FROM THE

03:53.066 --> 03:54.200
FACT THAT HOST DIDN'T FEEL THE

03:54.266 --> 03:55.200
NEED TO TAKE HIS

03:55.266 --> 03:56.800
FESTIVELY-WRAPPED CELL PHONE OUT

03:56.866 --> 03:58.700
OF HIS BREAST POCKET, TO THE

03:58.766 --> 03:59.500
OFFENSIVELY ALASKAN CHOICE OF

03:59.566 --> 04:01.300
CANDIDATES.

04:01.366 --> 04:02.033
IT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF NEW

04:02.100 --> 04:03.033
JERSEY EXPLAINING RANKED CHOICE

04:03.100 --> 04:04.666
VOTING USING BON JOVI,

04:04.733 --> 04:06.833
TONY SOPRANO, A DEER THAT'S

04:06.900 --> 04:07.966
NEVER EATEN FOOD INTENDED FOR

04:08.033 --> 04:10.133
DEER, AND MELANOMA.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.700
ALSO, GOOD CALL LOSING PENGUIN,

04:11.766 --> 04:12.933
WHICH, OF COURSE, DON'T EVEN

04:13.000 --> 04:13.933
HAVE THE DECENCY TO LIVE IN THE

04:14.000 --> 04:14.766
STATE.

04:14.833 --> 04:16.166
BUT I GUESS IT JUST GOES TO

04:16.233 --> 04:17.266
SHOW, EVEN WHEN THEY'RE MADE UP

04:17.333 --> 04:22.166
OF FICTIONAL ANIMALS, EVERY

04:22.233 --> 04:22.866
ELECTION HAS TO HAVE ITS DR. OZ.

04:22.933 --> 04:23.533
NOW, THE REASON ALASKANS NEED TO

04:23.600 --> 04:24.933
FILL THAT HOUSE SEAT IS THAT

04:25.000 --> 04:26.600
DON YOUNG, WHO SERVED SINCE

04:26.666 --> 04:28.833
1973, DIED EARLIER THIS YEAR.

04:28.900 --> 04:31.433
AND IF YOU'RE NOT AWARE OF

04:31.500 --> 04:33.166
DON YOUNG, HE WAS A "LOT".

04:33.233 --> 04:34.400
JOHN BOEHNER ONCE CLAIMED THAT

04:34.466 --> 04:35.766
YOUNG PINNED HIM AGAINST A WALL

04:35.833 --> 04:36.766
IN THE HOUSE AND HELD A TEN-INCH

04:36.833 --> 04:38.500
KNIFE TO HIS THROAT.

04:38.566 --> 04:40.200
BUT HE ALSO HAD LESS LIKEABLE

04:40.266 --> 04:41.633
MOMENTS, LIKE CALLING THE

04:41.700 --> 04:43.733
BP OIL SPILL NOT AN

04:43.800 --> 04:44.933
ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER BUT

04:45.000 --> 04:45.866
"A NATURAL PHENOMENA",

04:45.933 --> 04:47.533
REFERRING TO LATINOS USING A

04:47.600 --> 04:48.966
RACIAL SLUR, AND BEHAVING LIKE

04:49.033 --> 04:50.500
THIS DURING A DISCUSSION OF

04:50.566 --> 04:52.133
NAMING A POST OFFICE AFTER A

04:52.200 --> 04:52.633
MARINE WHO WAS KILLED IN

04:52.700 --> 04:54.000
AFGHANISTAN.

04:54.066 --> 04:54.866
JUST WATCH THE LEFT-HAND SIDE OF

04:54.933 --> 04:56.500
YOUR SCREEN.

04:56.566 --> 04:58.133
>> STAFF SERGEANT DeAUGUSTINE

04:58.200 --> 05:02.333
WAS KILLED ON MARCH 27, 2012, IN

05:02.400 --> 05:05.166
HELMAND PROVINCE, AFGHANISTAN, A

05:05.233 --> 05:08.066
FIERCE BATTLEGROUND WHERE OVER

05:08.133 --> 05:12.166
19,000 MARINES WERE DEPLOYED.

05:12.233 --> 05:12.733
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:12.800 --> 05:13.400
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SOMBER

05:13.466 --> 05:14.333
MOMENT!

05:14.400 --> 05:15.966
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF SOMEONE

05:16.033 --> 05:17.000
DISRESPECTED YOUR MEMORY LIKE

05:17.066 --> 05:17.433
THAT?

05:17.500 --> 05:18.600
WATCH.

05:18.666 --> 05:20.166
>> DON YOUNG, THE SO-CALLED DEAN

05:20.233 --> 05:22.166
OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,

05:22.233 --> 05:22.866
HAS PASSED AWAY AT THE AGE OF

05:22.933 --> 05:24.900
88.

05:24.966 --> 05:25.566
YEAH, SEE?

05:25.633 --> 05:26.666
DOESN'T FEEL GOOD, DOES IT, DON?

05:26.733 --> 05:27.766
YOU'RE SO LUCKY YOU'RE DEAD

05:27.833 --> 05:29.566
RIGHT NOW!

05:29.633 --> 05:30.500
AND THEN THERE WAS YOUNG'S

05:30.566 --> 05:31.900
CONGRESSIONAL OFFICE DECORATION

05:31.966 --> 05:33.166
CHOICES, WHICH WERE STRIKING,

05:33.233 --> 05:34.833
AND ALWAYS HAD THE CAPACITY TO

05:34.900 --> 05:36.200
SURPRISE.

05:36.266 --> 05:37.866
>> THAT'S A HECK OF A GAVEL.

05:37.933 --> 05:38.533
>> YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS, DON'T

05:38.600 --> 05:42.200
YOU?

05:42.266 --> 05:43.266
>> UHHH, YEAH.

05:43.333 --> 05:44.066
>> YOU DO, HUH?

05:44.133 --> 05:44.433
WHAT IS IT?

05:44.500 --> 05:46.433
I DUNNO.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.466
>> IT'S A WALRUS'S PENIS.

05:48.533 --> 05:51.333
YEAH.

05:51.400 --> 05:53.100
THE QUESTION "WHAT IS IT" COULD

05:53.166 --> 05:54.033
REALLY ONLY BE ANSWERED WITH "I

05:54.100 --> 05:54.466
DUNNO" THERE.

05:54.533 --> 05:56.033
THE BIGGEST RED FLAG POSSIBLE

05:56.100 --> 05:56.733
WOULD BE FOR SOMEONE TO SAY,

05:56.800 --> 05:57.966
"HUNDRED PERCENT, NO DOUBT ABOUT

05:58.033 --> 05:58.400
IT, I COULD TELL YOU

05:58.466 --> 05:58.966
THAT'S A WALRUS

05:59.033 --> 06:03.400
DICK."

06:03.466 --> 06:04.033
ALSO, I'M NOT SURE WHERE DON

06:04.100 --> 06:05.266
YOUNG GOT THAT GAVEL, BUT I'M

06:05.333 --> 06:06.400
JUST GOING TO ASSUME HE USED TO

06:06.466 --> 06:07.633
HOST A PATERNITY COURT REALITY

06:07.700 --> 06:09.100
SHOW FOR WALRUSES.

06:09.166 --> 06:12.233
SO CLEARLY, DON YOUNG IS LEAVING

06:12.300 --> 06:14.266
SOME BIG, WEIRD SHOES TO FILL,

06:14.333 --> 06:15.466
AND THERE'S ALREADY A NAME-BRAND

06:15.533 --> 06:16.800
CONTENDER TO FILL THEM.

06:16.866 --> 06:18.566
AND DEEP DOWN, YOU ALREADY KNOW

06:18.633 --> 06:19.800
WHO IT IS, RIGHT?

06:19.866 --> 06:21.466
ALASKA NEEDS A POLITICIAN?

06:21.533 --> 06:23.366
YOU KNOW WHAT'S COMING.

06:23.433 --> 06:25.200
>> IF I WERE ASKED TO SERVE IN

06:25.266 --> 06:29.566
THE HOUSE AND TAKE HIS PLACE, I

06:29.633 --> 06:30.833
WOULD BE HUMBLED AND HONORED AND

06:30.900 --> 06:31.466
I WOULD.

06:31.533 --> 06:32.633
YEAH, IN A HEARTBEAT, I WOULD.

06:32.700 --> 06:37.466
YEP!

06:37.533 --> 06:38.933
SARAH FUCKING PALIN'S BACK, AND

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
IT'S LIKE IT'S 2008 ALL OVER

06:40.066 --> 06:40.366
AGAIN!

06:40.433 --> 06:41.000
SHE'S RUNNING FOR OFFICE, THE

06:41.066 --> 06:41.600
U-S ENTERED A BEAR MARKET, AND

06:41.666 --> 06:42.200
SEX AND THE CITY IS MAKING

06:42.266 --> 06:42.766
SPIN-OFFS IT, QUITE FRANKLY,

06:42.833 --> 06:43.700
DOESN'T HAVE THE MATERIAL TO

06:43.766 --> 06:45.433
BACK UP.

06:45.500 --> 06:47.500
SOCIETY IS GOING BACKWARDS.

06:47.566 --> 06:49.333
UNSURPRISINGLY, PALIN'S PLATFORM

06:49.400 --> 06:50.533
IS FULL OF CULTURE WAR BULLSHIT.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.600
SHE'S SAID WE "CAN'T GIVE UP" ON

06:52.666 --> 06:53.933
BENGHAZI AND HILLARY'S MISSING

06:54.000 --> 06:55.300
EMAILS, AND HAS VOWED TO FIGHT

06:55.366 --> 06:57.033
GUN CONTROL AND ABORTION RIGHTS.

06:57.100 --> 06:58.533
BUT SOME ALASKANS WORRY SHE'S

06:58.600 --> 06:59.700
ONLY RUNNING FOR THE FAME.

06:59.766 --> 07:01.100
LOCAL PRESS HAS SAID SHE'S BEEN

07:01.166 --> 07:02.266
NOTABLY DIFFICULT FOR ALASKANS

07:02.333 --> 07:04.166
TO TRACK DOWN, AND POINTED OUT

07:04.233 --> 07:05.800
SHE'S TURNED DOWN CANDIDATE

07:05.866 --> 07:07.466
FORUMS, INCLUDING ONE HOSTED BY

07:07.533 --> 07:09.000
THE ANCHORAGE REPUBLICAN WOMEN.

07:09.066 --> 07:11.366
SOMETHING THEY HANDLED WITH

07:11.433 --> 07:12.800
SUBLIME PASSIVE-AGGRESSION BY

07:12.866 --> 07:14.600
LEAVING AN EMPTY CHAIR FOR HER

07:14.666 --> 07:15.200
WITH HER NAME ON IT

07:15.266 --> 07:19.666
AND THE WORD, "NO".

07:20.233 --> 07:20.866
AND I KNOW CHAIRS DON'T HAVE

07:20.933 --> 07:21.633
AGENCY, OR ACCESS TO A PRINTER,

07:21.700 --> 07:23.133
BUT IT DOES LOOK LIKE SOMEONE

07:23.200 --> 07:24.466
TAPED THE NAME "PALIN" TO A

07:24.533 --> 07:25.733
CHAIR, AND NOW THE CHAIR ITSELF

07:25.800 --> 07:28.333
IS PROTESTING IT.

07:28.400 --> 07:29.366
ONE CONSERVATIVE PUBLISHER IN

07:29.433 --> 07:32.133
ALASKA EVEN SAID, "SARAH KNOWS

07:32.200 --> 07:33.900
HOW TO WORK A CROWD, BUT IT'S

07:33.966 --> 07:34.466
SARAH, INC."

07:34.533 --> 07:36.033
WHICH HONESTLY SOUNDS LIKE THE

07:36.100 --> 07:37.566
TITLE OF A SITCOM STARRING KAT

07:37.633 --> 07:39.700
DENNINGS THAT'S ALREADY QUIETLY

07:39.766 --> 07:42.800
DISAPPEARED FROM HBO MAX.

07:42.866 --> 07:43.400
IT'S NOT TV.

07:43.466 --> 07:44.000
IT'S A SERIES OF TAX WRITEOFFS

07:44.066 --> 07:46.366
TO APPEASE WALL STREET.

07:46.433 --> 07:48.233
LOOK, PALIN HAS ALWAYS BEEN A

07:48.300 --> 07:49.800
GRIFTER.

07:49.866 --> 07:51.400
AND IF THERE WAS ANY DOUBT ABOUT

07:51.466 --> 07:54.266
WHAT SHE REALLY CARES ABOUT,

07:54.333 --> 07:54.900
CHECK OUT THIS CHAOTICALLY SHOT

07:54.966 --> 07:56.333
AND EDITED VIDEO FROM HER

07:56.400 --> 07:57.500
INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT IN MAY, WHERE

07:57.566 --> 07:58.833
SHE SPOUTS A STREAM OF CAMPAIGN

07:58.900 --> 08:00.300
PLATITUDES, THEN MAKES CLEAR

08:00.366 --> 08:02.733
WHAT SHE'S REALLY UP TO.

08:02.800 --> 08:04.766
>> I'M STANDING HERE GETTING

08:04.833 --> 08:06.533
READY FOR A RIDE BACK TO MY HOME

08:06.600 --> 08:08.266
WITH OTHER CANDIDATES RUNNING

08:08.333 --> 08:10.300
FOR THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS

08:10.366 --> 08:11.666
TO REALLY MAKE THINGS RIGHT.

08:11.733 --> 08:13.066
THINGS ARE GOING ON IN OUR

08:13.133 --> 08:14.933
WORLD, IN OUR COUNTRY, AND WE'RE

08:15.000 --> 08:16.866
GONNA TAKE IT BACK.

08:16.933 --> 08:17.500
YAHOOS RUNNING OUR COUNTRY RIGHT

08:17.566 --> 08:18.233
NOW.

08:18.300 --> 08:19.466
WHOO, YEAH.

08:19.533 --> 08:21.100
THEY NEED TO REPLACED.

08:21.166 --> 08:21.466
SO, JOHN.

08:21.533 --> 08:22.533
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU.

08:22.600 --> 08:24.100
AND KNOW THAT THOSE AROUND YOU

08:24.166 --> 08:25.066
WHO LOVE YOU SO MUCH AND SPEAK

08:25.133 --> 08:27.800
SO HIGHLY OF YOU-ESPECIALLY

08:27.866 --> 08:28.600
JUSTIN-BUT OTHERS, THEY TOO

08:28.666 --> 08:30.000
WISHING YOU HAPPY, HAPPY

08:30.066 --> 08:32.633
BIRTHDAY.

08:32.700 --> 08:33.233
YEAH, IT SEEMS TO BE

08:33.300 --> 08:34.333
AN AD FOR BOTH HER CAMPAIGN, AND

08:34.400 --> 08:36.633
HER CAMEO, WITH THE CAPTION EVEN

08:36.700 --> 08:37.500
READING, "DON'T FORGET FATHER'S

08:37.566 --> 08:38.133
DAY CAMEO ORDERS FOR YOUR LOVED

08:38.200 --> 08:41.766
ONES".

08:41.833 --> 08:42.366
WHICH IS A SPECTACULAR RACKET,

08:42.433 --> 08:43.066
SINCE SHE'S ESSENTIALLY SAYING

08:43.133 --> 08:44.300
"DON'T FORGET TO PAY ME TO

08:44.366 --> 08:46.433
BRAINWASH YOUR DAD!"

08:46.500 --> 08:47.600
THE JOHN IN

08:47.666 --> 08:47.933
QUESTION?

08:48.000 --> 08:50.433
THAT WAS ME.

08:50.500 --> 08:53.233
MY BUDDY JUSTIN -- HE LOVES ME

08:53.300 --> 08:53.866
AND SPEAKS VERY HIGHLY OF ME --

08:53.933 --> 08:54.500
GOT IT FOR ME, AND IT WAS THE

08:54.566 --> 08:56.300
BEST GIFT I'VE EVER RECEIVED.

08:56.366 --> 08:58.100
BUT BEING SARAH PALIN IS GOOD

08:58.166 --> 08:59.500
BUSINESS -- ON HER FINANCIAL

08:59.566 --> 09:00.533
DISCLOSURES, SHE REVEALED THAT

09:00.600 --> 09:03.966
LAST YEAR, SHE MADE OVER TWO

09:04.033 --> 09:04.566
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM

09:04.633 --> 09:05.966
CAMEO.

09:06.033 --> 09:07.066
WHICH SHE DID BY CHARGING $199

09:07.133 --> 09:08.066
PER VIDEO.

09:08.133 --> 09:09.833
AND THAT'S JUST TOO MUCH TO PAY

09:09.900 --> 09:11.100
FOR AN INCOHERENT MESSAGE FROM A

09:11.166 --> 09:12.800
PARKING LOT.

09:12.866 --> 09:14.066
ESPECIALLY WHEN, FOR JUST $75,

09:14.133 --> 09:14.633
YOU CAN GET A MESSAGE FROM

09:14.700 --> 09:18.333
CARSON KRESSLEY, WHO'LL TELL YOU

09:18.400 --> 09:18.866
YOU LOOK GREAT.

09:18.933 --> 09:19.100
LOOK.

09:19.166 --> 09:19.800
>> HEY, JOHN, CARSON KRESSLEY

09:19.866 --> 09:20.866
HERE!

09:20.933 --> 09:22.200
YOU LOOK GREAT!

09:22.266 --> 09:24.166
HAVE YOU BEEN MOISTURIZING?

09:24.233 --> 09:26.233
THAT'LL BE $75, PLEASE.

09:26.300 --> 09:27.500
THANK YOU, CARSON!

09:27.566 --> 09:30.000
I HAVEN'T BEEN MOISTURIZING!

09:30.066 --> 09:31.766
AND LOOK -- WILL ALASKANS FALL

09:31.833 --> 09:32.300
FOR PALIN'S BULLSHIT?

09:32.366 --> 09:33.366
MAYBE!

09:33.433 --> 09:35.633
THEY'VE DONE SO IN THE PAST!

09:35.700 --> 09:37.566
BUT I SURE HOPE THEY DON'T THIS

09:37.633 --> 09:37.766
TIME.

09:37.833 --> 09:38.933
BECAUSE FRANKLY, THE ONLY

09:39.000 --> 09:40.900
CONCEIVABLE STEP DOWN FROM

09:40.966 --> 09:43.400
DON YOUNG WOULD BE SARAH PALIN,

09:43.466 --> 09:45.700
WHO, LIKE A WALRUS'S PENIS, IS A

09:45.766 --> 09:46.466
FUN ALASKAN NOVELTY, AND ONE

09:46.533 --> 09:48.933
THAT HAS ABSOLUTELY NO BUSINESS

09:49.000 --> 09:49.333
BEING IN CONGRESS.

09:49.400 --> 09:56.800
AND NOW, THIS.

09:56.866 --> 09:59.933
>> AND NOW 60 SECONDS OF TUCKER

10:00.000 --> 10:01.766
CARLSON BEING RIGHT ABOUT STUFF.

10:01.833 --> 10:04.400
>> AMERICA IS A RACIST COUNTRY.

10:04.466 --> 10:06.166
WHITE SUPREMACY IS OUR BIGGEST

10:06.233 --> 10:06.800
THREAT.

10:06.866 --> 10:07.466
REPUBLICAN SENATORS ARE

10:07.533 --> 10:09.233
PSYCHOSIS BIGOTS AND THEY DON'T

10:09.300 --> 10:09.633
CARE ABOUT WOMEN.

10:09.700 --> 10:11.733
THIS IS A BAD COUNTRY RUN BY

10:11.800 --> 10:11.966
RACISTS.

10:12.033 --> 10:16.766
IT'S HERE HISTORY IS INHERENTLY

10:16.833 --> 10:20.166
RACIST.

10:20.233 --> 10:23.533
THE PHRASES ALL LIVE MATTERS

10:23.600 --> 10:24.433
AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM AND THE

10:24.500 --> 10:26.233
CELEBRATION OF COLUMBUS DAY ARE

10:26.300 --> 10:29.200
RACIST.

10:29.266 --> 10:29.733
THE CAPITAL WAS A WHITE

10:29.800 --> 10:33.333
SUPREMACIST INSURRECTION.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.033
ONLY LOSERS AND FREAK SUPPORT

10:34.100 --> 10:36.800
DONALD TRUMP YEAR AGO I'VE

10:36.866 --> 10:37.800
ENJOYED WHITE PRIVILEGE.

10:37.866 --> 10:39.433
I'M A RACIST.

10:39.500 --> 10:40.633
RACIST!

10:40.700 --> 10:42.166
WHITE PEOPLE ARE A HOLES!

10:42.233 --> 10:44.366
THIS IS PROPAGANDA AT WORK!

10:44.433 --> 10:45.233
FOX NEWS IS PROPAGANDA!

10:45.300 --> 10:46.966
THIS IS THE GREATEST KIND OF

10:47.033 --> 10:48.200
PROPAGANDA DESIGNED TO DIVIDE

10:48.266 --> 10:49.900
THE COUNTRY BY RACE!

10:49.966 --> 10:51.033
TOO STUPID.

10:51.100 --> 10:52.966
NONE OF THIS IS REAL.

10:53.033 --> 10:53.966
IT'S ALL JUST NOISE.

10:54.033 --> 10:55.366
ALL OF THIS IS CRAZY.

10:55.433 --> 10:56.133
THIS IS TOTAL LUNACY.

10:56.200 --> 10:57.600
IT'S EASY TO LAUGH AT THIS BUT

10:57.666 --> 10:59.433
IT'S ALSO HORRIFYING.

10:59.500 --> 11:00.766
THINK ABOUT THE BRAINWASHING

11:00.833 --> 11:01.933
REQUIRED TO DO THIS.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.300
THIS CHANNEL SHOULDN'T BE

11:03.366 --> 11:05.633
ALLOWED.

11:06.933 --> 11:07.366
MOVING ON.

11:07.433 --> 11:08.033
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

11:08.100 --> 11:09.233
EARTH.

11:09.300 --> 11:10.366
IT'S BASICALLY THE OSCAR ISAAC

11:10.433 --> 11:11.766
OF PLANETS IN THAT IT SEEMS TO

11:11.833 --> 11:12.366
BE GETTING ALARMINGLY HOTTER

11:12.433 --> 11:14.300
EVERY YEAR.

11:14.366 --> 11:15.700
IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THIS PLANET'S

11:15.766 --> 11:16.533
NOT DOING GREAT.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.466
THE LEVEL OF CARBON DIOXIDE IN

11:18.533 --> 11:20.900
THE ATMOSPHERE IS NOW HIGHER

11:20.966 --> 11:22.233
THAN EVER IN HUMAN HISTORY, AND

11:22.300 --> 11:27.633
THE LATEST

11:27.700 --> 11:29.800
U.N.-COMMMISSIONED CLIMATE

11:29.866 --> 11:30.200
REPORT WAS CALLED

11:30.266 --> 11:30.800
"AN ATLAS OF HUMAN SUFFERING".

11:30.866 --> 11:31.400
WHICH, COINCIDENTALLY, IS ALSO

11:31.466 --> 11:31.933
THE SLOGAN FOR CRAIGSLIST.

11:32.000 --> 11:32.533
LUCKILY, THOUGH, ONE GROUP IS

11:32.600 --> 11:33.000
GIANT

11:33.066 --> 11:33.333
CORPORATIONS.

11:33.400 --> 11:35.000
MANY ARE NOW CLAIMING THEY'VE

11:35.066 --> 11:37.000
HIT UPON A SOLUTION -- BECOMING

11:37.066 --> 11:38.233
"CARBON NEUTRAL" OR "NET ZERO".

11:38.300 --> 11:39.733
BASICALLY, RUNNING THEIR

11:39.800 --> 11:40.866
BUSINESSES IN SUCH A WAY, THEY

11:40.933 --> 11:41.966
DON'T INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF

11:42.033 --> 11:43.033
CARBON IN THE ATMOSPHERE.

11:43.100 --> 11:45.366
AS OF LAST YEAR, "ONE IN FIVE OF

11:45.433 --> 11:46.966
THE WORLD'S TWO THOUSAND LARGEST

11:47.033 --> 11:50.300
PUBLICLY LISTED COMPANIES HAVE

11:50.366 --> 11:50.900
NOW COMMITTED TO A "NET-ZERO"

11:50.966 --> 11:51.333
EMISSIONS TARGET."

11:51.400 --> 11:52.500
WHICH SOUNDS GREAT!

11:52.566 --> 11:53.766
YOU MAY HAVE EVEN SEEN THEM

11:53.833 --> 11:55.833
BRAGGING ABOUT THEIR CLAIMS IN

11:55.900 --> 11:57.000
ADS, LIKE THIS ONE FROM UNITED

11:57.066 --> 11:58.566
AIRLINES, THIS ONE FROM APPLE,

11:58.633 --> 12:01.400
THIS ONE FROM SHELL, AND THIS

12:01.466 --> 12:02.466
ONE FROM AN UNEXPECTED SOURCE.

12:02.533 --> 12:04.166
>> KIT KAT IS COMMITTING TO

12:04.233 --> 12:09.633
BECOMING CARBON NEUTRAL BY

12:09.700 --> 12:10.266
2025, REDUCING EMISSIONS BY 50%

12:10.333 --> 12:11.366
THROUGH FOREST REGENERATION,

12:11.433 --> 12:13.833
PLANTING FIVE MILLION SHADE

12:13.900 --> 12:16.100
TREES, SUPPORTING REGENERATIVE

12:16.166 --> 12:18.800
FARMING, AND SECURING 100%

12:18.866 --> 12:19.400
RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY FOR OUR

12:19.466 --> 12:21.633
FACTORIES WORLDWIDE.

12:21.700 --> 12:23.766
AND WE'LL OFFSET ANY REMAINING

12:23.833 --> 12:24.800
CARBON BY INVESTING IN CLIMATE

12:24.866 --> 12:27.300
PROJECTS.

12:27.366 --> 12:29.400
LET'S GIVE THE PLANET A BREAK.

12:29.466 --> 12:30.200
YEAH, EVEN KIT KAT IS

12:30.266 --> 12:31.900
GETTING INVOLVED.

12:31.966 --> 12:32.400
WHICH IS A STRANGE SALES

12:32.466 --> 12:33.233
TECHNIQUE.

12:33.300 --> 12:34.366
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU DECIDE TO EAT

12:34.433 --> 12:35.666
A KIT KAT BAR BECAUSE OF THEIR

12:35.733 --> 12:37.366
NET ZERO TARGETS.

12:37.433 --> 12:38.233
YOU DECIDE TO EAT ONE BECAUSE

12:38.300 --> 12:40.400
YOU'RE AT ROCK BOTTOM AND YOU'RE

12:40.466 --> 12:40.600
OUT OF

12:40.666 --> 12:43.400
REESE'S PEANUT BUTTER CUPS.

12:43.466 --> 12:44.600
AS FOR THE SHOVEL MADE OUT OF A

12:44.666 --> 12:46.133
KIT KAT, THAT SEEMS LESS LIKE A

12:46.200 --> 12:47.200
SUSTAINABLE FARMING TOOL AND

12:47.266 --> 12:49.733
MORE LIKE WHAT YOU'D USE TO BURY

12:49.800 --> 12:51.600
THE BODY OF THE RED M&M.

12:51.666 --> 12:53.900
BUT THE KEY PHRASING COMES AT

12:53.966 --> 12:55.200
THE END THERE -- THAT THEY'D

12:55.266 --> 12:57.066
"OFFSET ANY REMAINING CARBON".

12:57.133 --> 12:59.133
THAT'S ACTUALLY A COMMON TACTIC.

12:59.200 --> 13:00.566
IN FACT, ONE STUDY THAT LOOKED

13:00.633 --> 13:01.833
CLOSELY AT THE NET-ZERO PROMISES

13:01.900 --> 13:03.266
OF DOZENS OF COMPANIES IN

13:03.333 --> 13:05.266
HEAVILY-POLLUTING INDUSTRIES

13:05.333 --> 13:06.733
FOUND THAT TWO-THIRDS OF THEM

13:06.800 --> 13:08.400
ARE RELYING ON OFFSETS INSTEAD

13:08.466 --> 13:10.833
OF EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS.

13:10.900 --> 13:13.933
OFFSETS ARE WILDLY POPULAR --

13:14.000 --> 13:14.666
EVEN BANDS HAVE PROMISED OVER

13:14.733 --> 13:16.333
THE YEARS TO USE THEM TO REDUCE

13:16.400 --> 13:17.400
THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF

13:17.466 --> 13:20.500
THEIR TOURS.

13:20.566 --> 13:21.633
ALL THE GREATS -- DAVE MATTHEWS,

13:21.700 --> 13:24.000
BON JOVI, COLDPLAY, AND EVEN

13:24.066 --> 13:25.900
SERGEANT PEPPER'S ANGSTY

13:26.600 --> 13:28.366
MY CHEMICAL ROMANCE.

13:28.433 --> 13:30.133
>> A BIG TOUR LIKE THIS USES

13:30.200 --> 13:31.900
TRUCKS, VANS,

13:31.966 --> 13:33.200
LIGHTS, SOUND, AND MORE, AND

13:33.266 --> 13:33.900
THAT HAS AN IMPACT ON THE

13:33.966 --> 13:35.300
ENVIRONMENT.

13:35.366 --> 13:36.400
SO WE'VE PARTNERED UP WITH A

13:36.466 --> 13:37.900
REALLY COOL NON-PROFIT

13:37.966 --> 13:38.700
ORGANIZATION CALLED REVERB TO

13:38.766 --> 13:40.366
HELP US GREEN THINGS UP.

13:40.433 --> 13:41.666
>> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY

13:41.733 --> 13:42.400
DO IS FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH ENERGY

13:42.466 --> 13:43.766
THE TOUR USES.

13:43.833 --> 13:46.066
THEN THEY INVEST IN ALTERNATIVE

13:46.133 --> 13:46.700
ENERGY PROJECTS TO HELP MAKE UP

13:46.766 --> 13:47.500
FOR IT.

13:47.566 --> 13:52.900
COOL.

13:52.966 --> 13:53.466
THANKS GUYS.

13:53.533 --> 13:54.300
AND I ADMIT IT'S NICE TO SEE

13:54.366 --> 13:54.900
THEM REPRESENT THEIR CORE FAN

13:55.266 --> 13:55.800
MIDDLE SCHOOLERS WHO HAVE TO

13:55.866 --> 13:56.600
GIVE A PRESENTATION IN FRONT OF

13:56.666 --> 13:58.033
THE CLASS AGAINST THEIR WILL.

13:58.100 --> 13:59.700
BUT I DON'T PARTICULARLY CARE

13:59.766 --> 14:00.300
FOR THE PHRASE "GREEN THINGS

14:00.366 --> 14:00.933
UP".

14:01.000 --> 14:02.133
IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING SHREK

14:02.200 --> 14:03.200
WOULD SAY RIGHT BEFORE HE

14:03.266 --> 14:04.366
REACHES A SEXUAL CLIMAX.

14:04.433 --> 14:06.400
"LOOK OUT, I'M ABOUT TO GREEN

14:06.466 --> 14:08.100
THINGS UP!

14:08.166 --> 14:14.500
WATCH ME, DONKEH!"

14:14.566 --> 14:16.033
AND YET, IF THE IDEA THAT YOU

14:16.100 --> 14:18.100
CAN SIMPLY INVEST A LITTLE MONEY

14:18.166 --> 14:19.633
AND MAKE YOUR CARBON FOOTPRINT

14:19.700 --> 14:20.633
DISAPPEAR SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE

14:20.700 --> 14:21.133
TRUE, THAT'S BECAUSE IT

14:21.200 --> 14:23.600
ABSOLUTELY IS.

14:23.666 --> 14:24.833
STUDY AFTER STUDY HAS INDICATED

14:24.900 --> 14:26.333
THAT MOST OFFSETS AVAILABLE ON

14:26.400 --> 14:28.366
THE MARKET DON'T RELIABLY REDUCE

14:28.433 --> 14:30.600
EMISSIONS.

14:30.666 --> 14:31.833
AND YET, OFFSETS ARE NOW THE

14:31.900 --> 14:33.433
BACKBONE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL

14:33.500 --> 14:34.800
POLICIES OF MANY OF THE BIGGEST

14:34.866 --> 14:36.033
POLLUTERS ON THE PLANET.

14:36.100 --> 14:37.533
SO, GIVEN THAT, TONIGHT, LET'S

14:37.600 --> 14:38.700
TALK ABOUT CARBON OFFSETS.

14:38.766 --> 14:40.400
WHAT THEY ARE, WHAT THEY CLAIM

14:40.466 --> 14:41.500
TO DO, AND HOW THEY MAY ACTUALLY

14:41.566 --> 14:43.266
BE MAKING THINGS EVEN WORSE.

14:43.333 --> 14:44.800
AND LET'S START WITH SOME BASIC

14:44.866 --> 14:46.000
DEFINITIONS.

14:46.066 --> 14:47.366
THE IDEA OF A CARBON OFFSET IS

14:47.433 --> 14:49.033
THAT, IF YOU EMIT CO2 INTO THE

14:49.100 --> 14:51.066
ATMOSPHERE, YOU CAN OFFSET IT

14:51.133 --> 14:52.800
BY, SAY, PLANTING OR PROTECTING

14:52.866 --> 14:54.733
TREES, WHICH REMOVE CARBON FROM

14:54.800 --> 14:56.900
THE AIR, OR BUILDING A WIND FARM

14:56.966 --> 14:58.566
TO REPLACE A FOSSIL FUEL PLANT.

14:58.633 --> 15:00.300
HERE'S HOW BP -- A MAJOR

15:00.366 --> 15:00.933
POLLUTER, OF COURSE -- SELLS THE

15:01.033 --> 15:02.566
IDEA.

15:02.633 --> 15:04.400
>> I'VE BEEN DRIVING AROUND AND

15:04.466 --> 15:06.100
GENERATING THREE TONS OF CARBON

15:06.166 --> 15:07.766
DIOXIDE, WHICH OF COURSE I'VE

15:07.833 --> 15:10.133
RELEASED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE TO

15:10.200 --> 15:11.233
JOIN ALL THE REST OF THE

15:11.300 --> 15:11.966
GREENHOUSE GASSES THAT ARE

15:12.033 --> 15:15.100
ALREADY OUT THERE.

15:15.166 --> 15:16.666
NOW, IMAGINE THAT MILES AWAY,

15:16.733 --> 15:18.533
MAYBE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE

15:18.600 --> 15:20.000
WORLD, SOMEBODY ELSE TAKES THREE

15:20.066 --> 15:20.600
TONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE OUT OF

15:20.666 --> 15:23.866
THE ATMOSPHERE.

15:23.933 --> 15:24.900
SO, WHAT'S HAPPENED?

15:24.966 --> 15:26.700
THREE TONS IN, THREE TONS OUT,

15:26.766 --> 15:30.400
ZERO.

15:30.466 --> 15:32.433
THAT VIOLENTLY BRITISH

15:32.500 --> 15:33.066
MAN DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF

15:33.133 --> 15:34.766
ILLUSTRATING THE CONCEPT THERE.

15:34.833 --> 15:36.633
I'M NOT SURE HE NEEDED TO USE

15:36.700 --> 15:38.566
THE DECORATIONS FROM A CLOWN'S

15:38.633 --> 15:39.200
FUNERAL TO DO IT, BUT I GUESS,

15:39.266 --> 15:40.633
WITHOUT THEM, I'D NEVER HAVE

15:40.700 --> 15:42.333
KNOWN WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN

15:42.400 --> 15:43.533
YOU ADD THREE TO SOMETHING BUT

15:43.600 --> 15:44.166
THEN TAKE THREE AWAY, IT SIMPLY

15:44.233 --> 15:45.066
CAN'T BE DONE.

15:45.133 --> 15:46.833
BUT IF THAT SIMPLE EXPLANATION

15:46.900 --> 15:47.800
DIDN'T DO IT FOR YOU, HERE'S ONE

15:47.866 --> 15:49.433
IDIOT EXPLAINING OFFSETS TO

15:49.500 --> 15:50.600
ANOTHER IDIOT, USING THE WORST

15:50.666 --> 15:53.166
POSSIBLE METAPHOR, GIVEN WHO THE

15:53.233 --> 15:54.900
SECOND IDIOT IS.

15:54.966 --> 15:56.133
>> OF COURSE, YOU CAN BUY CARBON

15:56.200 --> 15:57.033
OFFSETS, WHICH IS THE EQUIVALENT

15:57.100 --> 16:00.366
OF BUYING, YOU KNOW, A DIAMOND

16:00.433 --> 16:01.866
WATCH, RING, AND NECKLACE.

16:01.933 --> 16:03.233
IF YOU'RE UNFAITHFUL TO YOUR

16:03.300 --> 16:04.566
WIFE AND SAY, 'OH IT'S JUST AN

16:04.633 --> 16:06.266
OFFSET HONEY, NO PROBLEM.'

16:06.333 --> 16:08.666
THAT'LL WORK...

16:08.733 --> 16:10.333
WHICH A CARBON OFFSET IS 'OH I

16:10.400 --> 16:10.866
CAN SIN ALL I WANT.

16:10.933 --> 16:12.666
I CAN PUT OUT ALL THE EMISSIONS

16:12.733 --> 16:13.766
I WANT-BUT YOU GOT TO GET RID OF

16:13.833 --> 16:14.733
YOUR CARAVAN AND DRIVE A

16:14.800 --> 16:15.966
BICYCLE.'

16:16.033 --> 16:19.466
OKAY, SET ASIDE

16:19.533 --> 16:20.100
HANNITY'S INABILITY TO DECIDE IF

16:20.166 --> 16:20.700
HE THINKS CARBON OFFESETS ARE

16:20.766 --> 16:21.800
LIKE BUYING YOUR WIFE A NECKLACE

16:21.866 --> 16:22.366
"OR" FORCING SOMEONE ELSE TO

16:22.433 --> 16:25.366
RIDE A BIKE.

16:25.433 --> 16:25.966
LET'S JUST DWELL ON HIM SAYING

16:26.033 --> 16:26.766
THE WORDS, "IF YOU'RE UNFAITHFUL

16:26.833 --> 16:30.566
TO YOUR WIFE" TO NEWT GINGRICH,

16:30.633 --> 16:31.733
A MAN WHO WAS FAMOUSLY

16:31.800 --> 16:33.633
UNFAITHFUL TO "TWO" OF HIS THREE

16:33.700 --> 16:35.000
WIVES, SO FAR, TRYING TO GET

16:35.066 --> 16:36.700
ONE TO SIGN DIVORCE DOCUMENTS

16:36.766 --> 16:37.566
WHILE SHE WAS RECOVERING FROM

16:37.633 --> 16:39.400
CANCER SURGERY, AND ASKING THE

16:39.466 --> 16:40.800
SECOND FOR A DIVORCE SHORTLY

16:40.866 --> 16:43.133
AFTER SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH

16:43.200 --> 16:43.500
M.S.

16:43.566 --> 16:44.066
NO WONDER HE JUST SAT THERE

16:44.133 --> 16:44.666
SILENTLY UNTIL HANNITY STARTED

16:44.733 --> 16:46.233
SPEAKING AGAIN.

16:46.300 --> 16:47.866
I'M SURE HE DESPERATELY WANTED

16:47.933 --> 16:50.200
TO WALK OUT, BUT I GUESS NEWT

16:50.266 --> 16:51.600
WOULD NEVER DO THAT TO SEAN --

16:51.666 --> 16:52.266
HE ONLY DOES THAT TO PEOPLE WITH

16:52.333 --> 16:54.166
SEVERE ILLNESSES.

16:54.233 --> 16:57.033
OFFSETS ALLOW

16:57.100 --> 16:58.266
BUSINESSES THAT CAN'T

16:58.333 --> 16:59.066
IMMEDIATELY "REDUCE" THEIR

16:59.133 --> 17:00.566
EMISSIONS TO BALANCE THINGS OUT

17:00.633 --> 17:01.633
BY BUYING EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS

17:01.700 --> 17:04.100
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

17:04.166 --> 17:04.933
AND IN SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD,

17:05.000 --> 17:05.800
THEY'RE ACTUALLY A WAY TO MEET

17:05.866 --> 17:06.900
REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ON

17:06.966 --> 17:08.300
EMISSIONS.

17:08.366 --> 17:11.433
PLACES LIKE CHINA, KOREA,

17:11.500 --> 17:12.600
AUSTRALIA, AND CALIFORNIA HAVE

17:12.666 --> 17:13.700
SET CAPS FOR HOW MUCH COMPANIES

17:13.766 --> 17:14.466
CAN EMIT.

17:14.533 --> 17:16.800
AND IF YOU GO ABOVE THAT CAP,

17:16.866 --> 17:18.133
YOU MIGHT OPT TO BUY AN OFFSET

17:18.200 --> 17:20.566
TO GET BACK BELOW IT.

17:20.633 --> 17:21.200
BUT COMPANIES OPERATING OUTSIDE

17:21.266 --> 17:23.100
OF THOSE AREAS MIGHT STILL

17:23.166 --> 17:24.800
CHOOSE TO BUY OFFSETS

17:24.866 --> 17:26.266
VOLUNTARILY, SO THEY CAN

17:26.333 --> 17:27.466
MAKE CLAIMS LIKE THE ONES YOU

17:27.533 --> 17:29.766
SAW IN THOSE ADS EARLIER.

17:29.833 --> 17:31.000
THE VOLUNTARY MARKET IS SMALLER,

17:31.066 --> 17:36.566
BUT IT'S GROWING INCREDIBLY FAST

17:36.633 --> 17:37.166
- - IT QUADRUPLED TO NEARLY TWO

17:37.233 --> 17:37.666
BILLION DOLLARS IN 2021.

17:37.733 --> 17:38.500
EVEN YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL CAN

17:38.566 --> 17:41.033
NOW BE SOLD OFFSETS.

17:41.100 --> 17:45.466
YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN CHECKBOXES

17:45.533 --> 17:46.066
LIKE THESE ON SITES LIKE UPS,

17:46.133 --> 17:47.000
OFFERING YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO

17:47.066 --> 17:47.533
OFFSET THE CARBON OF YOUR

17:47.600 --> 17:49.166
DELIVERY, OR MAYBE YOU WERE

17:49.233 --> 17:51.366
OFFERED ONE AS AN IMPULSE BUY

17:51.433 --> 17:52.033
WHILE TRAVELING.

17:52.100 --> 17:52.766
>> TRAVELERS THROUGH AUSTIN'S

17:52.833 --> 17:54.500
AIRPORT CAN HELP OFFSET THE

17:54.566 --> 17:56.100
EMISSIONS THEIR FLIGHTS PUT INTO

17:56.166 --> 17:57.300
THE ATMOSPHERE.

17:57.366 --> 17:59.833
IT ONLY COSTS $2 AND OFFSETS

17:59.900 --> 18:01.600
MORE THAN 1,000 MILES OF AIR

18:01.666 --> 18:03.333
TRAVEL.

18:03.400 --> 18:06.133
THAT PRICE IS OBVIOUSLY

18:06.200 --> 18:10.033
TOO LOW.

18:10.100 --> 18:10.666
IT'S PRETTY SUSPICIOUS THAT YOU

18:10.733 --> 18:11.300
COULD WALK INTO AN AIRPORT, AND

18:11.366 --> 18:11.866
OFFSET MORE THAN A THOUSAND

18:11.933 --> 18:12.533
MILES OF AIR TRAVEL FOR JUST TWO

18:12.600 --> 18:13.533
DOLLARS, THEN HEAD OVER TO A

18:13.600 --> 18:14.866
CIBO EXPRESS WHERE IT COSTS AT

18:14.933 --> 18:16.666
LEAST FIVE TIMES THAT TO BUY A

18:16.733 --> 18:18.766
SOGGY CHICKEN WRAP THAT SOMEHOW

18:18.833 --> 18:20.800
LOOKS -- IF I HAD TO PICK ONE

18:20.866 --> 18:21.400
DESCRIPTOR FOR IT -- RECENTLY

18:21.466 --> 18:22.866
DIVORCED.

18:22.933 --> 18:24.533
THERE ARE EVEN BOUTIQUE

18:24.600 --> 18:27.566
COMPANIES POPPING UP, LIKE

18:27.633 --> 18:28.700
"WORLD'S FIRST HUMAN BREATH

18:28.766 --> 18:29.200
CARBON OFFSET SERVICE,"

18:29.266 --> 18:30.933
WHERE YOU CAN, FOR SEVENTEEN

18:31.000 --> 18:31.700
DOLLARS A YEAR, OFFSET YOUR OWN

18:31.766 --> 18:33.366
BREATH.

18:33.433 --> 18:34.933
AND IF YOU JUST LET OUT A HUGE

18:35.000 --> 18:36.600
EXASPERATED SIGH AT HEARING

18:36.666 --> 18:38.333
THAT'LL COST

18:38.400 --> 18:40.233
EXTRA.

18:40.300 --> 18:43.133
YEP, YOU ALSO OFFERS YOU THE

18:43.200 --> 18:45.100
CHANCE TO OFFSET YOUR PETS,

18:45.166 --> 18:46.800
RANGING FROM $.06 FOR A HAMSTER

18:46.866 --> 18:49.100
TO $6 FOR A CAT, ALL THE WAY TO

18:49.166 --> 18:50.433
$10 TO OFFSET YOUR PIG.

18:50.500 --> 18:52.800
WHICH SEEMS GREAT, ASIDE FROM

18:52.866 --> 18:53.366
THE FACT THAT "$10 TO OFFSET

18:53.433 --> 18:55.666
YOUR PIG" SOUNDS LIKE A DUTCH

18:55.733 --> 18:57.133
SEX ACT THAT WAS SENT BACK AND

18:57.200 --> 18:58.866
FORTH THROUGH GOOGLE TRANSLATE

18:58.933 --> 19:01.766
ONE TOO MANY TIMES.

19:01.833 --> 19:02.733
"FOR $10, BASILIUS, HE OFFSET

19:02.800 --> 19:04.566
YOUR PIG, SO GOOD, SO STRONG,

19:04.633 --> 19:06.833
YOUR EYES WILL POP AND YOUR

19:06.900 --> 19:12.433
BRAVE TESTICLES WILL SWITCH."

19:12.500 --> 19:13.966
ON SOME LEVEL, YOU

19:14.033 --> 19:15.600
PROBABLY KNOW CARBON OFFSETS ARE

19:15.666 --> 19:16.700
BULLSHIT.

19:16.766 --> 19:21.500
BOTH BECAUSE YOU'RE A REASONABLY

19:21.566 --> 19:22.100
INTELLIGENT PERSON AND BECAUSE

19:22.166 --> 19:22.633
YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT SHOW

19:22.700 --> 19:24.300
YOU'RE WATCHING RIGHT NOW.

19:24.366 --> 19:26.800
I DON'T OPEN MY BEAK TO SQUAWK

19:26.866 --> 19:28.433
OUT GOOD NEWS; THIS THING POPS

19:28.500 --> 19:29.600
OPEN FOR SAD NEWS AND PORRIDGE,

19:29.666 --> 19:32.500
AND I'M ALL OUT OF PORRIDGE.

19:32.566 --> 19:34.933
BUT EXACTLY HOW THEY'RE BULLSHIT

19:35.000 --> 19:39.133
IS INTERESTING.

19:39.200 --> 19:39.900
BECAUSE IT'S EASY TO SAY

19:39.966 --> 19:41.033
YOU'RE REDUCING CARBON

19:41.100 --> 19:42.866
EMISSIONS, BUT IT'S MUCH HARDER

19:42.933 --> 19:43.466
TO PROVE IT, AND THE TRUTH IS,

19:43.533 --> 19:44.066
THERE AREN'T MANY CHECKS AND

19:44.133 --> 19:44.800
BALANCES IN PLACE TO PREVENT

19:44.866 --> 19:46.300
ABUSE.

19:46.366 --> 19:49.300
AND LET'S START WITH THE FACT

19:49.366 --> 19:49.866
THAT A KEY CRITERION FOR ANY

19:49.933 --> 19:51.566
OFFSET PROJECT IS WHAT'S CALLED

19:51.633 --> 19:52.800
"ADDITIONALITY."

19:52.866 --> 19:54.300
THE IDEA IS THAT AN OFFSET

19:54.366 --> 19:56.933
SHOULD PROVIDE AN "EXTRA"

19:57.000 --> 19:57.466
REDUCTION OF CARBON, THAT

19:57.533 --> 19:58.333
WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED ANY OTHER

19:58.400 --> 19:59.300
WAY.

19:59.366 --> 20:00.433
FOR INSTANCE, IF YOU PLANTED A

20:00.500 --> 20:01.333
TREE THAT WOULDN'T OTHERWISE

20:01.400 --> 20:02.833
HAVE BEEN PLANTED, THAT'S

20:02.900 --> 20:04.333
ADDITIONAL.

20:04.400 --> 20:05.733
AS IS SAVING A TREE THAT WOULD

20:05.800 --> 20:07.466
OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN CUT DOWN.

20:07.533 --> 20:10.966
BUT THERE ARE MANY CASES WHERE

20:11.033 --> 20:12.866
THE CLAIM OF "ADDITIONALITY" IS

20:12.933 --> 20:16.433
SHAKY, AT BEST.

20:16.500 --> 20:18.900
TAKE J.P. MORGAN, WHICH

20:18.966 --> 20:22.300
ANNOUNCED IT HAD ACHIEVED

20:22.366 --> 20:22.900
"CARBON NEUTRALITY" ACROSS ITS

20:22.966 --> 20:23.566
OPERATIONS IN 2020.

20:23.633 --> 20:25.933
ONE OF THE WAYS IT CLAIMED TO

20:26.000 --> 20:26.466
HAVE ELIMINATED ITS CARBON

20:26.533 --> 20:27.100
FOOTPRINT IS BY BUYING A MILLION

20:27.166 --> 20:27.633
DOLLARS WORTH OF OFFSETS,

20:27.700 --> 20:28.266
CLAIMING TO PROTECT AN AREA IN

20:28.333 --> 20:28.933
PENNSYLVANIA CALLED

20:29.000 --> 20:30.266
HAWK MOUNTAIN SANCTUARY.

20:30.333 --> 20:31.866
BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT THE

20:31.933 --> 20:32.666
THREATS TO THE SANCTUARY WERE

20:32.733 --> 20:34.800
WILDLY OVERBLOWN.

20:34.866 --> 20:35.866
>> THIS IS THE PROJECT'S

20:35.933 --> 20:37.466
PLANNING DOCUMENT SUBMITTED IN

20:37.533 --> 20:38.633
2018 TO THE AMERICAN CARBON

20:38.700 --> 20:40.466
REGISTRY, AND THIS IS THE

20:40.533 --> 20:42.266
BASELINE THE PROJECT'S BUILT

20:42.333 --> 20:42.966
UPON -- THAT IF IT WEREN'T FOR

20:43.033 --> 20:43.933
INTERVENTION, THE FORESTS WILL

20:44.000 --> 20:45.800
BE SUBJECT TO AGGRESSIVE

20:45.866 --> 20:47.533
CLEAR-CUTTING AND HIGH GRADING.

20:47.600 --> 20:49.900
THE PROBLEM WAS HAWK MOUNTAIN

20:49.966 --> 20:50.466
PRESERVE, AS ITS NAME WOULD

20:50.533 --> 20:54.500
SUGGEST, WAS ALREADY A PRESERVE.

20:54.566 --> 20:55.500
SINCE THE 1930S.

20:55.566 --> 20:57.766
THIS AREA HAS BEEN CLOSELY

20:57.833 --> 20:58.400
LOOKED AFTER, MANAGED, AND

20:58.466 --> 20:59.100
PROTECTED.

20:59.166 --> 21:00.433
THE FOREST DIDN'T NEED SAVING.

21:00.500 --> 21:02.433
IT WASN'T UNDER THREAT.

21:02.500 --> 21:03.366
YEAH, OF COURSE IT

21:03.433 --> 21:04.500
WASN'T.

21:04.566 --> 21:05.866
AND THAT PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE

21:05.933 --> 21:06.933
BEEN OBVIOUS FROM THE FACT IT

21:07.000 --> 21:10.033
WAS A PRESERVE, AND NOT CALLED

21:10.100 --> 21:10.700
THE "HAWK MOUNTAIN CHOP-CHOP

21:10.766 --> 21:11.166
ZONE AND TREE MURDER

21:11.233 --> 21:14.100
PLAYGROUND".

21:14.166 --> 21:14.866
AS A REPORTER FROM BLOOMBERG

21:14.933 --> 21:18.000
UNCOVERED, THAT OFFSET WAS SOLD

21:18.066 --> 21:18.566
TO J.P. MORGAN BY THE NATURE

21:18.633 --> 21:19.533
CONSERVANCY, WHICH HAS BEEN VERY

21:19.600 --> 21:20.200
ACTIVE IN SELLING CARBON OFFSET

21:20.266 --> 21:23.133
PROJECTS.

21:23.200 --> 21:23.733
THEY ALSO SOLD ONE HUNDRED AND

21:23.800 --> 21:24.300
EIGHTY THOUSAND CREDITS TO

21:24.366 --> 21:27.100
DISNEY, WHICH OSTENSIBLY WENT TO

21:27.166 --> 21:27.666
PROTECT THIS FOREST IN RURAL

21:27.733 --> 21:28.400
PENNSYLVANIA FROM WHAT THE

21:28.466 --> 21:29.900
CONSERVANCY WARNED WAS A RISK OF

21:29.966 --> 21:31.300
SIGNIFICANT COMMERCIAL TIMBER

21:31.366 --> 21:32.933
HARVESTING.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.400
THE NATURE

21:34.466 --> 21:37.300
CONSERVANCY ITSELF HAD OWNED

21:37.366 --> 21:39.400
MOST OF THAT LAND SINCE 1999.

21:39.466 --> 21:40.833
AND THEY'RE NOT, FAMOUSLY, IN

21:40.900 --> 21:41.500
THE COMMERCIAL TIMBER HARVESTING

21:41.566 --> 21:43.966
BUSINESS.

21:44.033 --> 21:45.366
AND YOU MIGHT THINK, "WELL, GOOD

21:45.433 --> 21:45.933
FOR THEM.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.066
THEY'RE TAKING DISNEY'S MONEY,

21:47.133 --> 21:48.266
AND NOT HAVING TO GIVE THEM

21:48.333 --> 21:49.266
ANYTHING IN RETURN."

21:49.333 --> 21:51.366
BUT THEY ARE GIVING THEM

21:51.433 --> 21:52.500
SOMETHING, THOUGH -- NAMELY, THE

21:52.566 --> 21:54.333
ABILITY TO MAKE CLAIMS LIKE,

21:54.400 --> 21:56.900
"DISNEY REDUCED OVER 4 MILLION

21:56.966 --> 21:58.166
TONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE, EQUAL TO

21:58.233 --> 22:00.166
TAKING OVER 900,000 CARS OFF THE

22:00.233 --> 22:00.866
ROAD."

22:00.933 --> 22:02.666
WHICH WE ALREADY KNOW ISN'T TRUE

22:02.733 --> 22:05.000
BUT, IF IT WERE, I DO HOPE THEY

22:05.066 --> 22:07.700
WOULD START WITH MATER.

22:07.766 --> 22:10.933
I DON'T CARE IF HE'S LIGHTNING

22:11.000 --> 22:11.500
McQUEEN'S BEST FRIEND, HE'S

22:11.566 --> 22:11.800
CHOKING US.

22:11.866 --> 22:12.333
HE'S CHOKING OUR PLANET TO

22:12.400 --> 22:14.133
DEATH.

22:14.200 --> 22:15.833
ALSO THE MONEY FROM OFFSETS

22:15.900 --> 22:17.133
DOESN'T ALWAYS GO TO PLACES LIKE

22:17.200 --> 22:19.033
THE NATURE CONSERVANCY.

22:19.100 --> 22:21.166
REMEMBER THAT AIRPORT PLAN WHERE

22:21.233 --> 22:23.366
YOU COULD OFFSET MORE THAN A

22:23.433 --> 22:26.566
THOUSAND MILES OF AIR TRAVEL FOR

22:26.633 --> 22:27.666
$2?

22:27.733 --> 22:28.266
RECORDS SHOW THAT THIS YEAR, A

22:28.333 --> 22:29.666
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE MONEY

22:29.733 --> 22:30.266
FROM THAT PROGRAM HAS GONE TO

22:30.333 --> 22:31.700
SUPPORT TREES AT THE

22:31.766 --> 22:32.400
"HUDSON FARM CLUB," IN NEW

22:32.466 --> 22:34.533
JERSEY, A 3,800-ACRE PRIVATE

22:34.600 --> 22:35.800
HUNTING CLUB SET UP BY

22:35.866 --> 22:38.300
PETER KELLOGG -- BILLIONAIRE AND

22:38.366 --> 22:40.133
MODEL FOR THE L.L. BEAN "HEART

22:40.200 --> 22:40.666
FAILURE AT THE YACHT CLUB"

22:40.733 --> 22:41.333
COLLECTION.

22:41.400 --> 22:41.900
HERE'S ONE MEMBER EXPLAINING

22:41.966 --> 22:43.766
WHAT HAPPENS THERE.

22:43.833 --> 22:46.400
>> PETER HAD THIS VISION OF

22:46.466 --> 22:49.366
HAVING A PLACE FOR SEVERAL OF

22:49.433 --> 22:52.933
HIS FRIENDS AND ADDITIONAL

22:53.000 --> 22:54.333
MEMBERS TO HUNT IN NEW JERSEY

22:54.400 --> 22:56.166
AND TO SHOOT IN NEW JERSEY AND

22:56.233 --> 22:58.333
TO DEVELOP ONE OF THE BEST

22:58.400 --> 22:59.000
SPORTING CLAYS SPOTS IN THE

22:59.066 --> 23:00.200
WHOLE NORTHEAST, IF NOT THE

23:00.266 --> 23:01.700
COUNTRY.

23:01.766 --> 23:02.600
IT'S CALLED HUDSON FARM.

23:02.666 --> 23:04.200
IT'S APPROXIMATELY 3800 ACRES.

23:04.266 --> 23:06.100
IT'S IN ANDOVER, NEW JERSEY.

23:06.166 --> 23:07.100
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL

23:07.166 --> 23:09.700
PLACES ON EARTH I'VE EVER SEEN.

23:09.766 --> 23:10.400
AND IT IS A HUNTERS' AND

23:10.466 --> 23:12.066
SHOOTERS' PARADISE.

23:12.133 --> 23:18.866
OKAY.

23:18.933 --> 23:20.033
FIRST, IT'S NOT JUST ME, WE'RE

23:20.100 --> 23:25.233
GETTING "GET OUT" VIBES?

23:25.300 --> 23:27.833
SECOND, THEY CLAIMED WITHOUT THE

23:27.900 --> 23:30.600
MONEY FROM CARBON OFFSETS, 77%

23:30.666 --> 23:32.866
OF THE TREES COULD BE CLEAR-CUT

23:32.933 --> 23:34.200
IN FIVE YEARS.

23:34.266 --> 23:34.866
BUT THAT CLEARLY WASN'T GOING TO

23:34.933 --> 23:35.100
HAPPEN.

23:35.166 --> 23:35.733
IT'S OWNED BY A BILLIONAIRE, AND

23:35.800 --> 23:36.233
EXISTS FOR RICH GUYS TO

23:36.300 --> 23:36.866
FANTASIZE ABOUT SHOOTING ANIMALS

23:36.933 --> 23:40.966
IN THE WILD, RIGHT DOWN TO

23:41.033 --> 23:41.600
THIS LIFE-SIZED CARDBOARD CUTOUT

23:41.666 --> 23:44.000
OF A BUFFALO ON FOUR WHEELS.

23:44.066 --> 23:45.666
IN FACT, I'D ARGUE THE ONLY REAL

23:45.733 --> 23:47.933
DAMAGE THAT MIGHT HAPPEN THERE

23:48.000 --> 23:48.700
IS FROM THAT GUY YOU SAW TALKING

23:48.766 --> 23:50.133
EARLIER, WHO SEEMS IN DANGER OF

23:50.200 --> 23:51.533
CASUALLY SHOOTING OFF HIS OWN

23:51.600 --> 23:53.533
NUTSACK.

23:53.600 --> 23:54.666
AND WITH THE MARKET FOR CARBON

23:54.733 --> 23:59.766
OFFSETS INCREASING, THERE ARE

23:59.833 --> 24:00.300
NOW COMPANIES NOW ACTIVELY

24:00.366 --> 24:00.933
RECRUITING ALMOST ANYONE WHO HAS

24:01.000 --> 24:02.300
A TREE, TO GET IN ON THE ACTION.

24:02.366 --> 24:03.000
FIRMS LIKE THESE ARE IN THE

24:03.066 --> 24:04.433
BUSINESS OF FINDING SMALL

24:04.500 --> 24:05.633
LANDOWNERS AND CONNECTING THEM

24:05.700 --> 24:06.800
WITH COMPANIES WHO'LL PAY THEM

24:06.866 --> 24:08.633
NOT TO CUT DOWN THEIR TREES,

24:08.700 --> 24:12.933
PITCHING THEMSELVES WITH ADS

24:13.000 --> 24:13.666
LIKE THIS ONE FROM NCX.

24:13.733 --> 24:14.266
>> WE'RE IN A CRITICAL DECADE

24:14.333 --> 24:14.900
FOR THE CLIMATE AND FORESTS ARE

24:14.966 --> 24:16.033
A POWERFUL NATURAL SOLUTION FOR

24:16.100 --> 24:17.066
REMOVING CARBON FROM THE

24:17.133 --> 24:18.266
ATMOSPHERE.

24:18.333 --> 24:19.566
NCX'S FOREST DATA SCIENTISTS

24:19.633 --> 24:20.766
DEVELOPED THE FIRST

24:20.833 --> 24:21.566
HIGH-RESOLUTION FOREST MAP OF

24:21.633 --> 24:23.333
EVERY ACRE OF AMERICA.

24:23.400 --> 24:25.633
NOW, EVERY LANDOWNER AND

24:25.700 --> 24:26.433
EVERY ACRE OF FOREST CAN BE PART

24:26.500 --> 24:28.433
OF THE CLIMATE SOLUTION.

24:28.500 --> 24:29.600
YEAH, BASICALLY,

24:29.666 --> 24:30.666
THEY'LL PAY YOU TO LEAVE YOUR

24:30.733 --> 24:31.466
TREES ALONE.

24:31.533 --> 24:32.600
WHICH IS A PRETTY GOOD DEAL, AS

24:32.666 --> 24:34.200
IT SHOULD BE EASY NOT TO CUT

24:34.266 --> 24:35.400
DOWN TREES, UNLESS, OF COURSE,

24:35.466 --> 24:37.200
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS ONE.

24:37.266 --> 24:39.700
BECAUSE FUCK THIS TREE.

24:39.766 --> 24:41.033
IT HAS AT LEAST SEVEN DIFFERENT

24:41.100 --> 24:43.900
EYES, "TEETH", AND IT SEEMS TO

24:43.966 --> 24:44.633
BE VOMITING UP A BUSH.

24:44.700 --> 24:46.233
YOU LOOK LIKE THE GIVING TREE IF

24:46.300 --> 24:51.766
ALL IT GAVE YOU WAS NIGHTMARES

24:51.833 --> 24:54.200
H.P. LOVECRAFT.

24:54.266 --> 24:54.733
I HATE THIS TREE!

24:54.800 --> 24:55.933
AND WITH NCX, YOU DON'T EVEN

24:56.000 --> 24:56.533
HAVE TO PROMISE "NEVER" TO CUT

24:56.600 --> 24:57.133
YOUR TREES DOWN, AS THEY GIVE

24:57.200 --> 24:57.800
YOU THE OPTION TO STILL GET PAID

24:57.866 --> 25:01.266
SIMPLY TO DEFER CUTTING THEM

25:01.333 --> 25:01.800
DOWN FOR "AS LITTLE AS ONE

25:01.866 --> 25:02.633
YEAR."

25:02.700 --> 25:04.000
BUT A TWELVE-MONTH DELAY DOESN'T

25:04.066 --> 25:05.500
REALLY BENEFIT THE PLANET MUCH.

25:05.566 --> 25:07.033
AS ONE EXPERT WE TALKED TO

25:07.100 --> 25:09.166
FRAMED IT, IT'S AKIN TO SELLING

25:09.233 --> 25:10.300
A CARBON CREDIT FOR HOLDING YOUR

25:10.366 --> 25:11.300
BREATH FOR FIFTEEN SECONDS.

25:11.366 --> 25:12.566
ALSO, THERE'S A MUCH BIGGER

25:12.633 --> 25:14.066
PROBLEM WITH ALL THESE

25:14.133 --> 25:15.133
TREE-BASED PROGRAMS, WHICH IS

25:15.200 --> 25:17.866
THAT EVEN THEY DO PROTECT ONE

25:17.933 --> 25:19.166
SECTION OF TREES FROM LOGGING,

25:19.233 --> 25:20.866
THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN

25:20.933 --> 25:22.000
MUCH, IF A LOGGING OPERATION

25:22.066 --> 25:23.600
SIMPLY CUTS DOWN THE TREES ON

25:23.666 --> 25:25.533
THE LAND NEXT DOOR INSTEAD.

25:25.600 --> 25:27.000
PLUS, GIVEN THAT

25:27.066 --> 25:28.800
FOREST FIRES ARE NOW ON THE RISE

25:28.866 --> 25:29.866
THANKS TO CLIMATE CHANGE, OFFSET

25:29.933 --> 25:31.266
PROGRAMS CAN, AND HAVE,

25:31.333 --> 25:34.366
LITERALLY GONE UP IN FLAMES.

25:34.433 --> 25:36.800
ALL OF THIS IS WHY, WHILE

25:36.866 --> 25:37.566
COMPANIES LOVE TO MAKE BIG,

25:37.633 --> 25:39.100
BROAD CLAIMS ABOUT THE BENEFITS

25:39.166 --> 25:40.566
OF THEIR OFFSETS, THEY REALLY

25:40.633 --> 25:41.133
DON'T LIKE GETTING INTO THE

25:41.200 --> 25:43.900
DETAILS.

25:43.966 --> 25:45.233
TAKE THE AIRLINE A FEW YEARS

25:45.300 --> 25:45.633
AGO, THEY BEGAN A

25:45.700 --> 25:46.333
VOLUNTARY PROGRAM WHERE

25:46.400 --> 25:48.100
CUSTOMERS COULD CONTRIBUTE ONE

25:48.166 --> 25:49.133
EURO TO HELP OFFSET THEIR

25:49.200 --> 25:50.700
FLIGHT, POINTING TO

25:50.766 --> 25:52.200
TREE-PLANTING SCHEMES IN IRELAND

25:52.266 --> 25:53.400
AND PORTUGAL THAT WOULD HELP DO

25:53.466 --> 25:55.000
THAT.

25:55.066 --> 25:56.700
BUT AN EXPERT LATER FOUND

25:56.766 --> 25:59.266
THOSE SCHEMES OFFSET LESS THAN

25:59.333 --> 26:03.100
0.01 PERCENT OF RYANAIR'S 2019

26:03.166 --> 26:04.633
EMISSIONS -- AND WHEN ITS CEO

26:04.700 --> 26:05.233
WAS PRESSED ON THIS, HE GOT A

26:05.300 --> 26:05.966
LITTLE DEFENSIVE.

26:06.033 --> 26:07.233
>> THE POINT HERE IS THAT YOU'VE

26:07.300 --> 26:08.700
GOT A LARGE AND GROWING AIRLINE

26:08.766 --> 26:10.300
THAT EMITS A LOT OF CARBON

26:10.366 --> 26:12.866
DIOXIDE AND YOUR OFFSETTING

26:12.933 --> 26:13.900
SCHEME NOWHERE NEAR MEETS THAT.

26:13.966 --> 26:15.800
>> ABSOLUTELY WRONG!

26:15.866 --> 26:20.333
>> BUT THERE'S AN IRISH FOREST,

26:20.400 --> 26:20.866
ISN'T THERE, IN ROSCOMMON?

26:20.933 --> 26:21.633
>> YEP.

26:21.700 --> 26:22.533
>> WHICH IS 7 HECTARES.

26:22.600 --> 26:24.766
I MEAN, IT IS NOTHING.

26:24.833 --> 26:25.400
>> FROM LITTLE ACORNS GROW

26:25.466 --> 26:27.000
MIGHTY TREES.

26:27.066 --> 26:28.333
>> IF YOU'VE ONLY GOT 7

26:28.400 --> 26:28.933
HECTARES, YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO

26:29.000 --> 26:30.333
GET 7 HECTARES OF MIGHTY OAKS

26:30.400 --> 26:31.233
AREN'T YOU?

26:31.300 --> 26:31.833
>> WE'VE ONLY STARTED THIS IN

26:31.900 --> 26:32.333
THE LAST YEAR.

26:32.400 --> 26:33.033
I MEAN, WE'RE WORKING WITH FOUR

26:33.100 --> 26:33.766
PROJECTS.

26:33.833 --> 26:35.966
WE'RE RE -- YOU KNOW, WE'RE

26:36.033 --> 26:36.633
REPLANTING TREES IN MONCHIQUE IN

26:36.700 --> 26:38.466
PORTUGAL.

26:38.533 --> 26:40.133
WE'RE SUPPORTING WHALES AND

26:40.200 --> 26:41.066
DOLPHINS IN IRELAND AS WELL.

26:41.133 --> 26:41.633
>> WHALE TRACKING WHICH HAS

26:41.700 --> 26:42.766
NOTHING TO DO WITH CARBON

26:42.833 --> 26:43.366
DIOXIDE.

26:43.433 --> 26:44.066
>> AND THE BIZARRE ONE --

26:44.133 --> 26:44.700
>> WHICH HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

26:44.766 --> 26:45.200
CARBON DIOXIDE.

26:45.266 --> 26:45.933
>> NO, BUT IT'S GOOD FOR THE

26:46.000 --> 26:46.533
ENVIRONMENT.

26:46.600 --> 26:48.466
I DON'T THINK ANY OF OUR

26:48.533 --> 26:49.633
CUSTOMERS WOULD OBJECT TO

26:49.700 --> 26:50.233
SUPPORTING WHALES AND DOLPHINS

26:50.300 --> 26:51.166
IN IRELAND.

26:51.233 --> 26:52.400
OKAY, IT'S NOT THAT

26:52.466 --> 26:53.433
PEOPLE WOULD OBJECT TO THAT.

26:53.500 --> 26:54.233
OF COURSE PEOPLE LOVE WHALES AND

26:54.300 --> 26:56.966
DOLPHINS.

26:57.033 --> 26:58.333
WHALES ARE BIG HONKIN' BOYS WHO

26:58.400 --> 26:59.900
UPSHIT WATER OUT OF THEIR HEADS,

26:59.966 --> 27:01.400
AND DOLPHINS ARE SMOOTH,

27:01.466 --> 27:02.266
FRIENDLY WATER DOGS WHO CACKLE

27:02.333 --> 27:05.033
LIKE DEMONIC BABIES -- THEY'RE

27:05.100 --> 27:05.633
BOTH EXCELLENT.

27:05.700 --> 27:06.566
BUT PROTECTING THEM ISN'T THE

27:06.633 --> 27:08.266
THING YOU PROMISED.

27:08.333 --> 27:08.900
IT'S LIKE IF YOU ASKED YOUR

27:08.966 --> 27:10.466
HUSBAND TO PICK UP YOUR KIDS

27:10.533 --> 27:13.966
FROM SCHOOL AND HE CAME HOME

27:14.033 --> 27:17.566
CHILDLESS, BUT WITH A PIZZA.

27:17.633 --> 27:18.200
YOU'RE NOT MAD AT THE PIZZA --

27:18.266 --> 27:18.800
NO ONE'S EVER MAD AT THE PIZZA

27:18.866 --> 27:19.400
- - BUT IT'S NOT THE IMPORTANT

27:19.466 --> 27:20.000
THING HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO

27:20.066 --> 27:20.733
DO.

27:20.800 --> 27:23.300
THE PROBLEM WITH CARBON OFFSETS

27:23.366 --> 27:23.966
IS, EVERYONE WANTS TO BELIEVE IN

27:24.033 --> 27:25.833
THEM.

27:25.900 --> 27:26.866
BUYERS WANT A CHEAP WAY TO MAKE

27:26.933 --> 27:28.500
A BIG CLAIM, AND SELLERS WANT

27:28.566 --> 27:29.100
MONEY FOR DOING AS LITTLE AS

27:29.166 --> 27:31.133
POSSIBLE.

27:31.200 --> 27:32.333
AND IDEALLY, THERE WOULD BE AN

27:32.400 --> 27:33.466
ENTITY IN THE MIDDLE CHARGED

27:33.533 --> 27:34.800
WITH KEEPING BOTH SIDES HONEST.

27:34.866 --> 27:37.200
AND THERE ACTUALLY IS -- THEY'RE

27:37.266 --> 27:39.466
CALLED CARBON OFFSET

27:39.533 --> 27:39.966
REGISTRIES.

27:40.033 --> 27:40.566
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE NEUTRAL

27:40.633 --> 27:42.400
THIRD PARTIES WHO SIGN OFF ON

27:42.466 --> 27:43.933
THE EFFICACY OF POTENTIAL

27:44.000 --> 27:45.100
OFFSETS.

27:45.166 --> 27:47.433
THESE FOUR ARE THE MAJOR ONES IN

27:47.500 --> 27:48.900
THE VOLUNTARY OFFSET MARKET.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.866
BUT THOSE REGISTRIES AREN'T

27:50.933 --> 27:52.566
REALLY ACCOUNTABLE TO ANYONE --

27:52.633 --> 27:53.666
TECHNICALLY, YOU OR I COULD

27:53.733 --> 27:55.033
START A REGISTRY.

27:55.100 --> 27:56.800
AND GIVEN THAT THEY'RE PAID BY

27:56.866 --> 27:58.466
THE COMPANIES SELLING THE

27:58.533 --> 28:02.866
OFFSETS, IT WON'T SURPRISE YOU

28:02.933 --> 28:03.566
TO LEARN MANY EXPERTS SAY

28:03.633 --> 28:04.500
THEIR STANDARDS ARE FAR TOO LOW

28:04.566 --> 28:05.700
- - AS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE FACT

28:05.766 --> 28:07.700
THE HAWK MOUNTAIN PRESERVE, THE

28:07.766 --> 28:08.433
DISNEY FOREST, AND THE HUNTING

28:08.500 --> 28:10.166
CLUB, ALL MET THE STANDARDS

28:10.233 --> 28:12.333
OF THE AMERICAN CARBON REGISTRY.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.400
BASICALLY, GETTING A SIGN OFF

28:14.466 --> 28:15.700
FROM A CARBON REGISTRY IS LIKE

28:15.766 --> 28:17.600
WINNING A KIDS CHOICE AWARD --

28:17.666 --> 28:19.133
IT DOESN'T REALLY MEAN MUCH, BUT

28:19.200 --> 28:20.333
IT WILL HELP YOU TEMPORARILY

28:20.400 --> 28:23.400
LOOK A LITTLE GREENER.

28:23.466 --> 28:24.900
THE PROBLEM ISN'T

28:24.966 --> 28:26.000
THOSE PROJECTS THEMSELVES.

28:26.066 --> 28:28.866
IT'S GOOD TO PROTECT FORESTS!

28:28.933 --> 28:30.266
BUT THE ISSUE IS CLAIMING THEY

28:30.333 --> 28:32.200
CANCEL OUT CARBON EMISSIONS.

28:32.266 --> 28:34.266
BECAUSE TRULY OFFSETTING CARBON

28:34.333 --> 28:36.266
IS TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE.

28:36.333 --> 28:38.133
THEORETICALLY, IF A WIND FARM

28:38.200 --> 28:39.766
GETS BUILT TO REPLACE A

28:39.833 --> 28:41.100
FOSSIL-FUEL PLANT, THAT HAD ZERO

28:41.166 --> 28:45.633
LIKELIHOOD OF GETTING BUILT

28:45.700 --> 28:46.166
OTHERWISE, THAT COULD BE A

28:46.233 --> 28:47.366
GENUINE OFFSET.

28:47.433 --> 28:48.600
BUT REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES OF THAT

28:48.666 --> 28:50.733
ARE EXTREMELY HARD TO FIND.

28:50.800 --> 28:52.133
ONE STUDY OF WIND TURBINE

28:52.200 --> 28:54.100
PROJECTS IN INDIA, FOR INSTANCE,

28:54.166 --> 28:55.666
FOUND THAT AT LEAST FIFTY-TWO

28:55.733 --> 28:57.600
PERCENT OF APPROVED CARBON

28:57.666 --> 28:59.600
OFFSETS STEMMED FROM PROJECTS

28:59.666 --> 29:00.266
THAT WOULD VERY LIKELY HAVE BEEN

29:00.333 --> 29:01.500
BUILT ANYWAY.

29:01.566 --> 29:02.733
WHICH CAUSES REAL DAMAGE.

29:02.800 --> 29:04.266
BECAUSE POLLUTERS IN COUNTRIES

29:04.333 --> 29:05.033
THAT CAP EMISSIONS BOUGHT THOSE

29:05.100 --> 29:07.400
OFFSETS.

29:07.466 --> 29:09.400
AND WHEN YOU BUY AN OFFSET SO

29:09.466 --> 29:10.833
YOU CAN POLLUTE MORE -- AND THAT

29:10.900 --> 29:13.133
OFFSET IS BULLSHIT -- YOU'RE

29:13.200 --> 29:14.133
ACTIVELY MAKING THINGS WORSE.

29:14.200 --> 29:15.400
IN FACT, THAT STUDY ARGUES

29:15.466 --> 29:17.766
THE SALE OF THOSE OFFSETS

29:17.833 --> 29:18.900
SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED GLOBAL

29:18.966 --> 29:20.266
CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS.

29:20.333 --> 29:22.200
WHICH CLEARLY ISN'T GOOD.

29:22.266 --> 29:25.400
AND THERE'S ONE FINAL WAY CARBON

29:25.466 --> 29:25.900
OFFSETS CAN CAUSE HARM.

29:25.966 --> 29:28.766
BECAUSE WHEN THAT

29:28.833 --> 29:29.533
BP SPOKESPERSON WITH THE GOTH

29:29.600 --> 29:31.833
BALLOONS REFERRED TO BUILDING AN

29:31.900 --> 29:32.466
OFFSETTING PROJECT "MILES AWAY,

29:32.533 --> 29:34.833
MAYBE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE

29:34.900 --> 29:36.266
WORLD", IT'S WORTH REMEMBERING

29:36.333 --> 29:37.800
THAT PEOPLE MIGHT BE LIVING

29:37.866 --> 29:38.866
THERE.

29:38.933 --> 29:39.700
A DECADE AGO, THE SWEDISH ENERGY

29:39.766 --> 29:41.700
AGENCY ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD

29:41.766 --> 29:42.700
BOUGHT CARBON CREDITS FROM A

29:42.766 --> 29:43.833
COMPANY CALLED GREEN RESOURCES,

29:43.900 --> 29:45.266
WHICH SAID IT HAD PLANTED

29:45.333 --> 29:47.466
PINE FORESTS IN UGANDA, THAT

29:47.533 --> 29:48.200
COULD OFFSET CARBON EMISSIONS

29:48.266 --> 29:49.700
ELSEWHERE.

29:49.766 --> 29:51.966
THE PROBLEM WAS, THOUSANDS OF

29:52.033 --> 29:53.366
RURAL UGANDANS WERE EVICTED BY

29:53.433 --> 29:55.766
THE UGANDAN GOVERNMENT TO MAKE

29:55.833 --> 29:57.066
ROOM FOR THE PLANTATION,

29:57.133 --> 29:58.600
INCLUDING THIS MAN, WHOSE FAMILY

29:58.666 --> 29:59.766
ONCE FARMED A LARGE PLOT OF LAND

29:59.833 --> 30:02.466
THERE.

30:02.533 --> 30:04.066
>> WHEN I WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD, I

30:04.133 --> 30:05.233
STARTED HERDING CATTLE.

30:05.300 --> 30:06.766
THE OTHER KIDS AND I HERDED THE

30:06.833 --> 30:08.433
LIVESTOCK ON OUR LAND.

30:08.500 --> 30:10.000
THERE WERE ROCKS, WHICH WERE

30:10.066 --> 30:10.566
REMNANTS FROM MY GREAT GREAT

30:10.633 --> 30:14.533
GRANDFATHER'S DAY.

30:14.600 --> 30:15.733
ODONGO, DO YOU HAVE

30:15.800 --> 30:16.400
A POSSIBILITY TO JUST SHOW US

30:16.466 --> 30:18.533
WHERE YOUR LAND WAS?

30:18.600 --> 30:20.033
>> NO, THAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM.

30:20.100 --> 30:20.633
I CAN GET IN TROUBLE IF I SHOW

30:20.700 --> 30:21.966
YOU THE LAND.

30:22.033 --> 30:26.733
THAT'S AWFUL.

30:26.800 --> 30:27.333
NO ONE SHOULD EVER BE SCARED

30:27.400 --> 30:29.966
TO SHOW SOMEONE A PIECE OF LAND,

30:30.033 --> 30:32.333
UNLESS, OF COURSE, THAT JANKY

30:32.400 --> 30:32.800
FUCKING TREE IS ON IT.

30:32.866 --> 30:33.533
IF THERE WERE ANY SQUIRRELS

30:33.600 --> 30:34.633
LIVING IN YOU, THEY'VE DIED OF

30:34.700 --> 30:35.933
EMBARRASSMENT, I HOPE YOU KNOW

30:36.033 --> 30:37.300
THAT.

30:37.366 --> 30:38.533
AND THE SWEDISH ENERGY AGENCY

30:38.600 --> 30:39.800
WILL POINT OUT THAT THEY'VE NOW

30:39.866 --> 30:41.033
BACKED AWAY FROM THAT UGANDAN

30:41.100 --> 30:42.466
PROJECT, BUT I'LL POINT OUT THEY

30:42.533 --> 30:44.433
ONLY DID THAT AFTER THAT

30:44.500 --> 30:45.500
NEWS SEGMENT YOU JUST SAW

30:45.566 --> 30:46.133
EMBARRASSED THEM ON SWEDISH

30:46.200 --> 30:47.433
TELEVISION.

30:47.500 --> 30:48.966
THEY WERE COMPLETELY FINE WITH

30:49.033 --> 30:50.666
IT UNTIL THEN.

30:50.733 --> 30:52.333
SO, IT SEEMS, AT BEST, THE

30:52.400 --> 30:54.233
BENEFITS OF CARBON OFFSETS ARE

30:54.300 --> 30:56.033
WILDLY OVERSTATED, WHILE THE

30:56.100 --> 30:58.700
HARM THEY CAN DO IS VERY REAL.

30:58.766 --> 30:59.900
AND WHILE THERE ARE ONGOING

30:59.966 --> 31:01.433
EFFORTS TO AT LEAST IMPROVE THE

31:01.500 --> 31:02.666
STANDARDS OF REGISTRIES, THE

31:02.733 --> 31:04.233
TRUTH IS, OFFSETS AREN'T THE

31:04.300 --> 31:05.500
ANSWER HERE.

31:05.566 --> 31:07.233
FUNDAMENTALLY, WE CAN'T OFFSET

31:07.300 --> 31:09.433
OUR WAY OUT CLIMATE CHANGE.

31:09.500 --> 31:10.900
EVEN THE CURRENT CEO OF

31:10.966 --> 31:13.566
UNITED AIRLINES KNOWS THIS.

31:13.633 --> 31:15.300
HE'S ONE OF THE FEW HEADS OF A

31:15.366 --> 31:17.333
FOSSIL-FUEL-DEPENDENT COMPANY

31:17.400 --> 31:19.466
WHO'S WILLING TO ACKNOWLEDGE HOW

31:19.533 --> 31:20.266
INADEQUATE OFFSETS CAN BE.

31:20.333 --> 31:22.500
>> THE REAL CHALLENGE WE HAVE

31:22.566 --> 31:24.233
GLOBALLY IS THAT MANKIND

31:24.300 --> 31:26.700
PRODUCES 4,000 TIMES AS MANY

31:26.766 --> 31:27.633
EMISSIONS AS WE DID IN THE

31:27.700 --> 31:29.266
PRE-INDUSTRIAL ERA.

31:29.333 --> 31:30.433
AND MOST OF THESE CARBON OFFSET

31:30.500 --> 31:31.000
PROJECTS ARE ABOUT PLANTING

31:31.066 --> 31:32.933
TREES.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.333
THERE IS NOT ROOM ON THE PLANET

31:34.400 --> 31:35.733
TO PLANT 4,000 TIMES AS MANY

31:35.800 --> 31:37.966
TREES.

31:38.033 --> 31:38.666
IT SIMPLY CAN'T BE THE ANSWER.

31:38.733 --> 31:40.766
AND THE PROBLEM WITH IT IS IS

31:40.833 --> 31:41.733
IT'S THE EASY SOLUTION.

31:41.800 --> 31:43.533
IT'S THE SOLUTION THAT IF YOU'RE

31:43.600 --> 31:45.766
SITTING IN THE C-SUITE, YOU CAN

31:45.833 --> 31:46.533
WRITE A CHECK AND CHECK THE BOX

31:46.600 --> 31:47.833
AND HAVE A MARKETING MESSAGE

31:47.900 --> 31:49.633
THAT I'VE OFFSET ALL MY CARBON,

31:49.700 --> 31:50.200
BUT YOU REALLY HAVEN'T DONE

31:50.266 --> 31:51.433
ANYTHING.

31:51.500 --> 31:52.566
HE'S RIGHT.

31:52.633 --> 31:56.366
THAT AIRLINE CEO IS RIGHT.

31:56.433 --> 31:57.633
ALTHOUGH IT SPEAKS TO THE

31:57.700 --> 31:58.900
SEDUCTIVE POWER OF OFFSETS THAT

31:58.966 --> 32:00.333
EVEN HIS COMPANY CAN'T GIVE THEM

32:00.400 --> 32:02.333
UP.

32:02.400 --> 32:03.000
IF YOU GO TO THE UNITED AIRLINES

32:03.066 --> 32:05.066
WEBSITE RIGHT NOW, YOU'LL FIND A

32:05.133 --> 32:05.666
PAGE WHERE YOU CAN OFFSET YOUR

32:05.733 --> 32:07.466
FLIGHT, IN FRONT OF A PICTURE OF

32:07.533 --> 32:09.333
A FUCKING FOREST.

32:09.400 --> 32:10.566
SO AT LEAST ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE

32:10.633 --> 32:11.666
SITTING IN THE C-SUITE, CHECKING

32:11.733 --> 32:14.633
A BOX IS THE GHOST OF MARK

32:14.700 --> 32:17.766
ZUCKERBERG FUTURE.

32:17.833 --> 32:19.233
BUT IT'S TRUE THAT THERE

32:19.300 --> 32:20.866
LITERALLY ISN'T ENOUGH SPACE FOR

32:20.933 --> 32:22.433
EVERY COMPANY TO PLANT TREES AND

32:22.500 --> 32:23.566
FULFILL THEIR OWN NET ZERO

32:23.633 --> 32:24.700
PLEDGE.

32:24.766 --> 32:26.633
BY ONE ESTIMATE, THERE'S ONLY

32:26.700 --> 32:27.466
ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

32:27.533 --> 32:28.600
HECTARES OF LAND LEFT THAT CAN

32:28.666 --> 32:30.400
BE DEDICATED TO NEW FORESTS FOR

32:30.466 --> 32:32.433
CARBON CAPTURE.

32:32.500 --> 32:34.900
AND SHELL ALONE, HAS PROPOSED

32:34.966 --> 32:37.000
PLANTING A TENTH OF THAT AMOUNT.

32:37.066 --> 32:38.633
THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE HAVE AN

32:38.700 --> 32:39.933
OFFSET SYSTEM THAT PLACES

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
PROFITS OVER SCIENCE, AND THE

32:41.066 --> 32:42.833
RULES REGULATING IT ARE FAR TOO

32:42.900 --> 32:43.500
LAX.

32:43.566 --> 32:45.033
AND THE REASON I KNOW THAT IS,

32:45.100 --> 32:47.400
REMEMBER WHEN, FIVE MINUTES AGO,

32:47.466 --> 32:48.900
I SAID THAT I COULD SET UP A

32:49.000 --> 32:49.800
CARBON REGISTRY?

32:49.866 --> 32:50.566
YOU ALREADY KNEW WHERE THIS WAS

32:50.633 --> 32:52.400
HEADING, RIGHT?

32:52.466 --> 32:54.166
YOU KNEW, IF THEY HAD A LOOPHOLE

32:54.233 --> 32:55.333
WHERE I COULD SET UP A REGISTRY,

32:55.400 --> 32:56.300
ESTABLISH WHATEVER STANDARDS I

32:56.366 --> 32:58.000
WANT, AND START LISTING

32:58.066 --> 32:58.700
PROJECTS, THAT I WAS GOING

32:58.766 --> 32:59.766
STRAIGHT THROUGH THAT FUCKING

32:59.833 --> 33:01.266
LOOPHOLE, RIGHT?

33:01.333 --> 33:02.100
YOU KNEW THAT WAS GOING TO

33:02.166 --> 33:09.100
HAPPEN.

33:09.166 --> 33:13.533
WELL I'M GLAD TO SAY YOU WERE

33:13.600 --> 33:13.833
CORRECT.

33:13.900 --> 33:14.466
WE SET UP OLIVER'S OFFSETS

33:14.533 --> 33:14.966
CARBON REGISTRY, AND I'M

33:15.033 --> 33:15.600
THRILLED TO ANNOUNCE AN EXCITING

33:15.666 --> 33:16.133
NEW PROJECT THAT MEETS OUR

33:16.200 --> 33:16.566
EXACTING STANDARDS.

33:16.633 --> 33:17.066
PLEASE -- COME WITH ME.

33:17.133 --> 33:18.833
AS YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE, WE HAVE

33:18.900 --> 33:20.100
TREES IN THE STUDIO NOW, TREES

33:20.166 --> 33:21.633
YOU CAN HELP PROTECT, WHILE ALSO

33:21.700 --> 33:22.266
OFFSETTING YOUR PERSONAL CARBON

33:22.333 --> 33:24.466
FOOTPRINT.

33:24.533 --> 33:26.500
NOW, ARE ANY OF THESE TREES

33:26.566 --> 33:27.566
UNDER THREAT?

33:27.633 --> 33:28.233
I'M CERTAINLY GOING TO TELL YOU

33:28.300 --> 33:31.700
THAT THEY ARE.

33:31.766 --> 33:33.833
BECAUSE I'LL CUT EVERY SINGLE

33:33.900 --> 33:39.133
ONE OF THESE FUCKERS DOWN.

33:39.200 --> 33:39.466
I'LL DO IT!

33:39.533 --> 33:40.066
MAYBE THERE ARE BIRDS LIVING IN
