WEBVTT

00:19.185 --> 00:20.953
Dads <i>is recorded in front</i>
<i>of a live studio audience.</i>

00:20.955 --> 00:23.022
(sound of
tennis ball thwacking)

00:27.193 --> 00:30.295
Wow, video game tennis.

00:30.297 --> 00:33.599
I had no idea my son was such
a gifted fake athlete.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.535
We got to practice.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.704
We're partners
in the SFVTT.

00:38.706 --> 00:41.440
I already don't care
what it is.

00:42.575 --> 00:45.644
It's the San Francisco
Virtual Tennis Tournament.

00:47.714 --> 00:50.549
I was right not to care.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.217
Hey, David.
Hey, Crawford.

00:52.219 --> 00:54.253
Camila, two martinis.

00:55.221 --> 00:56.889
I don't need one.

00:56.891 --> 00:59.324
I know.
(chuckles)

00:59.326 --> 01:02.227
Can you believe
this nonsense?

01:02.229 --> 01:04.063
When we were kids,
you actually did things.

01:04.065 --> 01:06.365
You wanted to play tennis,
you played tennis.

01:06.367 --> 01:08.367
Well, and we didn't
have computers then,

01:08.369 --> 01:13.572
so basically tennis was the only
way to see women's underwear.

01:13.574 --> 01:16.008
Video games are why
this country's going to hell.

01:16.010 --> 01:18.577
By the time I was his age,
I already had a family

01:18.579 --> 01:20.913
<i>and</i> left them.

01:20.915 --> 01:22.848
Look, I'm having fun
with my best friend.

01:22.850 --> 01:24.416
That's an experience
you've never had.

01:24.418 --> 01:25.884
I got friends.

01:25.886 --> 01:27.219
No, you don't.

01:27.221 --> 01:29.755
Name me one friend you've
got besides Crawford.

01:29.757 --> 01:33.058
Edna.

01:33.060 --> 01:34.760
My maid?

01:34.762 --> 01:36.628
What's her last name?

01:39.732 --> 01:41.900
All right, you got me.

01:41.902 --> 01:44.236
But I could make friends
in two seconds.

01:44.238 --> 01:45.604
How could you make friends?

01:45.606 --> 01:48.140
M-Maybe if you were in a
plane crash and survived,

01:48.142 --> 01:50.742
you could have weird
survival friends,

01:50.744 --> 01:52.578
but there is no way

01:52.580 --> 01:54.146
that you could have
personality-based friends

01:54.148 --> 01:56.882
in a non-plane-crash setting.

01:56.884 --> 02:02.421
Boy, it'd be so much easier to
make friends if we were Mormons.

02:02.423 --> 02:06.892
We'd have 18 brothers and
sisters right in the bedroom.

02:10.263 --> 02:13.398
¶ Daddy took me to the zoo

02:13.400 --> 02:15.434
¶ <i>Na, na, na, na</i> ¶

02:15.436 --> 02:19.471
¶ Just to see
something brand-new ¶

02:19.473 --> 02:21.507
¶ <i>Na, na, na</i> ¶

02:21.509 --> 02:25.744
¶ So many stars up in the sky

02:25.746 --> 02:30.182
¶ So many questions have I

02:30.184 --> 02:32.284
¶ <i>Na, na, na, na</i> ¶

02:32.286 --> 02:34.920
¶ Daddy took me for a ride.

02:38.791 --> 02:41.093
Ah.

02:41.095 --> 02:43.762
Yep, scotch definitely
tastes better

02:43.764 --> 02:46.632
when you're wearing pajamas.

02:46.634 --> 02:48.767
Whether it's that last one
at night

02:48.769 --> 02:51.837
or that first one
in the morning.

02:53.039 --> 02:55.040
That was pretty cute

02:55.042 --> 02:58.343
when Eli said
you were his best friend.

02:58.345 --> 03:01.346
Yeah.

03:01.348 --> 03:04.816
He's a cute kid.

03:04.818 --> 03:07.486
Is he your best friend?

03:07.488 --> 03:09.655
(Crawford clears throat)

03:09.657 --> 03:12.224
Course not, honey.

03:12.226 --> 03:13.725
And...

03:13.727 --> 03:15.827
You are.

03:15.829 --> 03:18.063
Good. 'Cause I was thinking I
could be your teammate this year

03:18.065 --> 03:19.464
in the tennis tournament.

03:19.466 --> 03:21.667
I can't do that to Eli.
He's my best friend.

03:21.669 --> 03:25.170
We have no activities together.

03:25.172 --> 03:27.906
What are you talking about?
We take long, silent car rides

03:27.908 --> 03:30.075
together all the time.

03:30.077 --> 03:32.477
Can't Eli just find
another partner?

03:32.479 --> 03:36.415
Well, you know, it's hard
for redheads to make friends.

03:36.417 --> 03:41.220
'Cause people subconsciously
think they're evil.

03:42.889 --> 03:46.091
Well, I am off
to my twin bed.

03:46.093 --> 03:48.727
Say good night
to the missus.

03:54.500 --> 03:58.036
Honey, couples do things
together all the time.

03:58.038 --> 04:00.005
Jen and Bob play golf.

04:00.007 --> 04:03.008
Well, that's because he feels
bad for cheating on her.

04:03.010 --> 04:05.177
Zack and Beth have karaoke.

04:05.179 --> 04:09.181
That's because Zack feels bad
for hooking up with Bob.

04:09.183 --> 04:11.283
Lucas and Moira
go rock climbing.

04:11.285 --> 04:13.185
But he's trying to kill her.

04:14.354 --> 04:15.520
He's-he's gonna cut the rope.

04:15.522 --> 04:18.023
It's a <i>Dateline </i>
<i>waiting to happen.</i>

04:18.025 --> 04:22.694
Seriously, baby,
what do we do together?

04:22.696 --> 04:26.064
We-we talk about other couples.

04:26.066 --> 04:29.134
All right. I just thought...

04:29.136 --> 04:32.137
it would be something fun
for us to do together, but...

04:32.139 --> 04:34.273
I guess...

04:34.275 --> 04:36.608
I was wrong.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.278
(sighs)

04:39.280 --> 04:43.615
(shuffling feet)
Oh, come on.

04:43.617 --> 04:47.786
Not the sad walk.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.122
(stammering): It's not...
I'm not gonna fall for it.

04:50.124 --> 04:52.658
Nah, n-no. Not this time.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.726
No.

05:00.166 --> 05:02.234
(sighs)

05:07.307 --> 05:09.374
(very long, exaggerated sigh)

05:13.946 --> 05:16.014
(sigh continuing)

05:18.584 --> 05:20.652
What's wrong?

05:22.288 --> 05:25.590
Oh, nothing. I'm just trying
to figure out a way to tell Eli

05:25.592 --> 05:27.459
that Camila's
my new tennis partner.

05:27.461 --> 05:28.994
Oh, how are you gonna do that?

05:28.996 --> 05:32.931
Well, I-I wrote some stuff down
that maybe I could...

05:32.933 --> 05:34.599
Go for it.
Okay, uh...

05:34.601 --> 05:36.601
First, how much I-I love him
as a friend

05:36.603 --> 05:39.271
and I value his partnership.
Uh...

05:39.273 --> 05:41.373
next, I slipped
in a little joke.

05:41.375 --> 05:44.343
And then I, uh, reminded him of
the good times we had together,

05:44.345 --> 05:46.945
then a second smaller joke,
this and that...

05:46.947 --> 05:49.047
and then, uh, I hit him hard
with the bad news,

05:49.049 --> 05:50.882
but I just don't think
I can say it to his face.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.050
So text him.

05:52.052 --> 05:53.618
Really? I can't text him.

05:53.620 --> 05:56.388
That's so cowardly.
I mean, come on. That's ridi...

05:56.390 --> 05:57.389
Oh, here he is.

05:57.391 --> 05:58.824
And send.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.892
Hey, guys.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.262
(phone chimes)

06:09.902 --> 06:12.537
Aw.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.873
(laughs)

06:16.376 --> 06:20.078
It was good times.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.914
(chuckles)

06:22.916 --> 06:25.984
Not as good as the first one
but still-still funny.

06:48.207 --> 06:50.275
(phone chimes)

06:51.744 --> 06:53.812
(quietly):
One second.

07:00.586 --> 07:02.654
(phone blips)

07:13.633 --> 07:16.301
I didn't get it.

07:17.270 --> 07:20.605
Oh, I sent it to Edna.

07:23.142 --> 07:25.210
Not cool, man.

07:32.151 --> 07:33.819
Where do you want this, Eli?

07:33.821 --> 07:35.887
Oh.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.828
Perfect.

07:43.830 --> 07:45.897
Come on.

07:52.805 --> 07:55.307
(chuckles)
This is ridiculous.

07:55.309 --> 07:57.809
We're best friends.
Talk to me.

08:11.824 --> 08:14.826
It's upside down.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.895
No, it's not.

08:18.664 --> 08:21.833
Look, I know
you're really disappointed,

08:21.835 --> 08:24.035
but my wife wants
to be my tennis partner

08:24.037 --> 08:26.137
and she comes first.

08:26.139 --> 08:28.807
Well, not in that way.

08:28.809 --> 08:32.644
Well, okay, sometimes.

08:32.646 --> 08:36.615
Okay, once and I still have
no idea what I did.

08:46.325 --> 08:49.160
Look, I know you want to do
fun stuff with Camila,

08:49.162 --> 08:51.663
but virtual tennis was ours.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.899
How would she like it
if I went to your house

08:53.901 --> 08:57.469
and ironed your clothes
and had your kids?

09:06.879 --> 09:11.883
I think she'd be
very, very confused.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.319
I'm very confused right now.

09:14.321 --> 09:16.888
I don't even know my own name!

09:16.890 --> 09:19.658
It's Eli.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.726
That doesn't sound right.

09:25.731 --> 09:27.732
Do you want
to lie down right now?

09:27.734 --> 09:28.733
No.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.735
I want to find another partner.

09:30.737 --> 09:33.171
Well, okay.
That's the spirit, Eli.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.340
I don't know who that is!

09:38.277 --> 09:40.912
Yeah. No, no, no, Jeff.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.747
I totally understand.

09:42.749 --> 09:45.150
Hey, what are you doing
after chemo?

09:49.088 --> 09:50.755
Fine.

09:50.757 --> 09:54.926
(groans)
People are so selfish!

09:54.928 --> 09:57.796
So, all your friends
coming through for you?

09:57.798 --> 09:59.631
Not now, Dad.

09:59.633 --> 10:02.601
The movie <i>Castaway </i>
<i>got it right.</i>

10:02.603 --> 10:06.738
Friends can be replaced
by an inflatable ball.

10:06.740 --> 10:09.240
You know, I just lost
my actual best friend.

10:09.242 --> 10:11.076
I could use
a little bit of support.

10:11.078 --> 10:13.912
There's no such thing
as a best friend.

10:13.914 --> 10:16.948
Even dogs aren't
your best friends.

10:17.917 --> 10:20.251
What are you talking about?

10:20.253 --> 10:23.755
If you were to die in your
apartment, within 24 hours,

10:23.757 --> 10:27.826
your "best friend"
would be eating your face.

10:29.762 --> 10:35.100
Remember how you picked up
his poop for five years?

10:35.102 --> 10:37.669
He doesn't.

10:39.171 --> 10:40.972
He's got your ear
in his mouth,

10:40.974 --> 10:44.442
tail wagging, having
a grand old time.

10:44.444 --> 10:46.444
Dad, if you really want
to help me,

10:46.446 --> 10:48.813
maybe you can be my partner
in this tennis tournament.

10:48.815 --> 10:52.117
If there's anything in my
personality that has given rise

10:52.119 --> 10:54.919
to the belief that I
would help you with this,

10:54.921 --> 10:57.689
I truly apologize.

10:58.958 --> 11:01.192
Is easy, Mr. David.

11:01.194 --> 11:03.461
Like feather duster.

11:03.463 --> 11:05.630
Feather, dust. Feather, dust.

11:05.632 --> 11:07.832
Feather, dust. Feather,

11:07.834 --> 11:10.468
dust.
Oh, my God.

11:10.470 --> 11:13.805
E-Edna, you're amazing.

11:13.807 --> 11:15.373
Wait, a-are you busy tomorrow?

11:15.375 --> 11:18.843
I spend eight hours a day
cleaning two rooms.

11:18.845 --> 11:21.179
Yeah, I got time.

11:26.318 --> 11:28.553
Well, here it is,

11:28.555 --> 11:31.923
the Super Bowl of
the participation
ribbon generation.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.995
You know who I love
to watch play tennis?

11:36.997 --> 11:38.596
Those Williams brothers.

11:41.167 --> 11:42.867
Amazing.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.836
ANNOUNCER:
And now,

11:44.838 --> 11:46.738
for our final match of the day,

11:46.740 --> 11:50.241
Warner and Camila Whittemore...
Yes! Yes!

11:50.243 --> 11:54.579
versus Eli and Ed-na...!

11:54.581 --> 11:56.648
(others cheering, whistling)

11:59.919 --> 12:04.422
Oh. So, this is the other woman
I've been hearing so much about.

12:04.424 --> 12:07.325
Eli, I've known you
for 15 years.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.928
Yeah? Well, I've
known him for 25.
WARNER: Okay,

12:09.930 --> 12:12.030
guys, this is not
a competition.

12:12.032 --> 12:14.566
ANNOUNCER:
The competition will now begin.

12:14.568 --> 12:17.368
Team Whittemore to serve.

12:17.370 --> 12:20.004
(sound of
tennis ball thwacking)

12:20.006 --> 12:21.740
(high-pitched grunt)

12:22.708 --> 12:24.943
Point, Edna. Love-15.

12:24.945 --> 12:27.212
Sorry. I'm so sorry.
It's okay.

12:27.214 --> 12:28.546
It's okay, you're
doing great.

12:28.548 --> 12:29.848
Okay? You're
doing great.
Okay.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.850
Would you look
at those legs!

12:31.852 --> 12:36.187
Yeah, we Whittemore men
are known for our great legs.

12:36.189 --> 12:38.857
You know, once
I was wearing short shorts

12:38.859 --> 12:40.391
in New York City...

12:40.393 --> 12:43.528
(chuckles)
and two cabs just drove
right up on the sidewalk.

12:43.530 --> 12:46.364
One of them hit a fire hydrant,
and five minutes later,

12:46.366 --> 12:48.700
it was an ethnic water park.

12:52.371 --> 12:55.473
(sound of tennis ball
thwacking)

12:55.475 --> 12:56.975
(high-pitched grunt)

13:00.880 --> 13:02.881
(high-pitched grunt)

13:04.116 --> 13:06.751
ANNOUNCER: Game and first set,
Eli and Edna!

13:06.753 --> 13:07.952
Yeah!

13:07.954 --> 13:10.588
Oh, great partner choice, buddy.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.490
Look, I need you to
pick it up, all right?

13:12.492 --> 13:14.392
You wanted to be partner,
so let's go, all right?

13:14.394 --> 13:16.561
I love you.
Love, love, love.

13:16.563 --> 13:18.129
Love, love,
love. Love.

13:19.932 --> 13:23.001
(sound of tennis ball
thwacking)

13:32.812 --> 13:35.180
How do you know Edna?

13:35.182 --> 13:37.982
Who's Edna?

13:37.984 --> 13:39.984
We just came
from a Dane Cook show.

13:41.854 --> 13:43.488
How was it?

13:43.490 --> 13:44.823
It sucked.

13:44.825 --> 13:48.660
ANNOUNCER:
Match point, Eli and Edna.

13:48.662 --> 13:50.461
All right, honey,
we just need to win

13:50.463 --> 13:52.997
212 points
in a row, okay?
Okay.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.866
Okay?
Okay.

13:54.868 --> 13:58.703
¶

13:58.705 --> 14:01.239
(sound of tennis ball
thwacking)

14:09.782 --> 14:13.218
¶

14:28.500 --> 14:31.402
¶

14:31.404 --> 14:35.473
ANNOUNCER: Eli and Edna are
your virtual tennis champions!

14:35.475 --> 14:37.575
She cheated!
She's on steroids!

14:37.577 --> 14:41.379
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
come on, dude, relax.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.748
Oh, yeah!
Great advice!

14:43.750 --> 14:45.583
That's you, isn't it?

14:45.585 --> 14:47.352
Mr. Relaxed.

14:47.354 --> 14:48.920
Never doing anything at work.

14:48.922 --> 14:51.489
Hey, I'm really cool
'cause I'm wearing a T-shirt

14:51.491 --> 14:54.225
and I'm 40 years old.
(goofy grunt, blows raspberry)

14:54.227 --> 14:56.427
CAMILA:
Okay, Werner,

14:56.429 --> 14:58.096
stop it!
Oh, my gosh,

14:58.098 --> 15:00.265
you are making a fool
of yourself right now.

15:00.267 --> 15:01.833
I-I'm making a fool of myself?!

15:01.835 --> 15:04.235
You totally blew
that last shot, honey.
No.

15:04.237 --> 15:08.072
I <i>almost</i> got that last
shot, but you pushed
me out of the way.

15:08.074 --> 15:11.442
Oh! Was that the one shot
you were gonna make?

15:11.444 --> 15:14.412
Yay! You didn't make one!
You know what?

15:14.414 --> 15:16.214
'Cause <i>almost</i> is good enough.

15:16.216 --> 15:18.383
And Jar Jar Binks
was <i>almost</i> funny.

15:18.385 --> 15:21.185
And America <i>almost</i> won Vietnam!

15:21.187 --> 15:22.520
Hey, let's celebrate, huh?

15:29.128 --> 15:31.529
(shrieks)

15:41.640 --> 15:44.709
Don't look at me.

15:46.578 --> 15:48.613
Well, you know,
if you go by body count,

15:48.615 --> 15:50.982
we did win the Vietnam War.

15:58.757 --> 15:59.924
So, who wants to start?

15:59.926 --> 16:02.126
Uh, well, I think
Warner should start.

16:02.128 --> 16:04.429
Yeah, me, too.

16:04.431 --> 16:07.298
Warner, why do you think
you're all here today?

16:08.267 --> 16:09.801
Uh... 'cause...

16:09.803 --> 16:13.471
'cause I got a little upset.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.239
A  <i>little</i>upset?
Yeah.

16:15.241 --> 16:18.409
You compared me
to Jar Jar Binks.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.345
Yeah, and you
smashed a TV.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.513
That was an inner-
city school, man.

16:22.515 --> 16:25.616
They're not gonna get
another one of those.

16:25.618 --> 16:28.019
Warner, can you explain
where your anger came from,

16:28.021 --> 16:30.321
why you felt the need
to manifest it physically?

16:30.323 --> 16:32.123
Uh...

16:32.125 --> 16:34.125
no.

16:34.127 --> 16:36.094
Maybe it has something
to do with the fact

16:36.096 --> 16:38.329
that your wife doesn't
respect our friendship.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.665
Maybe it's because your
best friend doesn't realize

16:40.667 --> 16:42.767
your wife and
children need you.

16:42.769 --> 16:46.004
Need him?! More like
need to smother him.

16:46.006 --> 16:48.006
What about your need
to keep him working late

16:48.008 --> 16:50.808
so you have someone
around to laugh at your
dumb movie references.

16:50.810 --> 16:53.011
From hell's heart
I stab at thee!

16:53.013 --> 16:54.679
<i>Wrath of Khan. </i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

16:54.681 --> 16:56.014
So what?

16:56.016 --> 16:57.849
I'm his wife.

16:57.851 --> 17:00.618
Yeah, I saw him naked
before you did.

17:00.620 --> 17:03.788
Is there a sexual element
to this relationship?

17:03.790 --> 17:04.856
No.
No.
No.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.190
Well, maybe that's the problem.

17:06.192 --> 17:08.793
No.
No.
No.

17:08.795 --> 17:10.628
You know, I'm hearing
a lot of "no,"

17:10.630 --> 17:13.331
which makes me think that
words may be failing us here.

17:13.333 --> 17:14.365
Come with me.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.733
Okay.

17:22.641 --> 17:23.574
Oh.

17:23.576 --> 17:24.742
This is cool.

17:24.744 --> 17:26.711
Hey, do you party?

17:26.713 --> 17:29.380
This is our nonverbal
communication room.

17:29.382 --> 17:30.548
What does that mean?

17:30.550 --> 17:32.350
It allows you
to express your emotions

17:32.352 --> 17:35.086
using the pure truth of sound.

17:35.088 --> 17:37.455
Yeah, you party.

17:38.824 --> 17:40.391
Please.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.228
So, uh...
(chuckles)

17:44.230 --> 17:47.265
w-we just choose
a drum or what...?

17:47.267 --> 17:50.001
The drum will choose you.

17:56.275 --> 17:58.643
All right,
just pick one.

18:01.246 --> 18:03.781
Now let me start
the conversation.

18:03.783 --> 18:06.250
(high-pitched beat)

18:06.252 --> 18:08.319
(deep-pitched beat)

19:49.855 --> 19:50.721
No.

19:52.324 --> 19:55.293
Put the drum down.

19:55.295 --> 19:57.228
I can't.

20:04.836 --> 20:06.070
Hey.

20:06.072 --> 20:07.838
You want to
hang out tonight?

20:07.840 --> 20:09.807
Well, I would love
to hang out with you,

20:09.809 --> 20:13.311
because you are a great friend
and I value our time together...

20:14.846 --> 20:17.481
...but I'm doing something
with Camila,

20:17.483 --> 20:19.517
who's also a great friend,

20:19.519 --> 20:22.653
and a generous lover.

20:22.655 --> 20:24.355
I am so glad to hear that.

20:24.357 --> 20:26.857
And while I <i>am</i> disappointed
that I won't get to see you,

20:26.859 --> 20:29.193
I appreciate you communicating
your plan to me.

20:29.195 --> 20:30.828
Well...

20:30.830 --> 20:34.565
communication is the basis
for a strong friendship.

20:35.901 --> 20:38.869
Which is what we have.

20:38.871 --> 20:40.938
To friendship.
To friendship.

20:42.074 --> 20:45.876
What the hell is going on?

20:45.878 --> 20:48.879
Well, Eli and I worked
some stuff out in therapy.

20:48.881 --> 20:50.047
You should try it.
Ugh,

20:50.049 --> 20:51.849
no way-- Asians
don't believe in therapy.

20:51.851 --> 20:54.185
We have on-off switches.

20:54.187 --> 20:55.920
Oh. I'd like to hear
more about this.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.054
Are you free tonight?

20:57.056 --> 20:58.456
And off.

20:59.558 --> 21:01.025
So, things good with Camila?

21:01.027 --> 21:03.227
Oh, yeah, we made up
big-time last night.

21:03.229 --> 21:07.031
This time she
brought <i>me</i> the towel.

21:07.033 --> 21:09.867
She is such
a generous lover.

21:09.869 --> 21:11.369
Yeah.

21:11.371 --> 21:14.005
How did things end up
with you and the therapist?

21:17.743 --> 21:20.544
So she's <i>not</i> pressing charges?

21:25.651 --> 21:29.954
You have to stay a hundred yards
away at all times?

21:31.923 --> 21:34.825
Oh, 50. Okay, nice, yeah.

21:34.827 --> 21:36.327
You guys,

21:36.329 --> 21:38.429
come on!
Oh!

21:38.431 --> 21:41.098
Are you ready to get
your Tiger Woods on?!

21:41.100 --> 21:44.502
Sí. He best
Mexican golfer ever.

21:45.804 --> 21:49.073
No, uh, Tiger Woods
is black plus Asian.

21:49.075 --> 21:51.142
Sí. Equal Mexican!
