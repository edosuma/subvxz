WEBVTT

00:10.386 --> 00:13.089
Can we hear it again? Please.

00:13.189 --> 00:15.717
More... tell us the story more!
Please.

00:15.817 --> 00:17.719
Okay, one more time

00:17.819 --> 00:20.138
and then it's off to bed.

00:20.238 --> 00:24.226
And there came
a day unlike any other

00:24.326 --> 00:27.437
when Earth's mightiest
heroes were united

00:27.537 --> 00:29.189
against a common threat...

00:29.289 --> 00:31.608
the soldier, the god,

00:31.708 --> 00:33.985
the knight, the spy,

00:34.085 --> 00:36.279
the giant, the king,

00:36.379 --> 00:39.407
the pixie, the ghost,

00:39.507 --> 00:41.618
and the archer.

00:41.718 --> 00:43.828
On that day,

00:43.928 --> 00:45.914
the Avengers were born,

00:46.014 --> 00:49.084
to fight foes that no single hero
could withstand.

00:49.184 --> 00:51.419
Time-traveling conquerors,

00:51.519 --> 00:54.881
alien invaders
and masters of evil...

00:54.981 --> 00:57.384
the Avengers vanquished them all

00:57.484 --> 01:00.053
and finally,
when the world was at peace,

01:00.153 --> 01:02.096
the heroes built lives
of their own.

01:02.196 --> 01:06.351
The soldier and spy
fell in love,

01:06.451 --> 01:08.687
as did the giant
and the pixie.

01:08.787 --> 01:11.439
The king found his queen.

01:11.539 --> 01:14.192
And the thunder god
returned to his kingdom

01:14.292 --> 01:17.404
far away
from the world of men.

01:17.504 --> 01:19.364
And one by one the children

01:19.464 --> 01:22.450
of the Avengers came to be...

01:22.550 --> 01:24.744
children who would one day

01:24.844 --> 01:28.290
become a new generation
of heroes.

01:28.390 --> 01:31.960
But in time evil returned,

01:32.060 --> 01:34.963
an evil called Ultron.

01:35.063 --> 01:37.465
Ultron wanted nothing less

01:37.565 --> 01:40.969
than total dominion
over the world.

01:41.069 --> 01:43.138
But the Avengers
stood in its way.

01:43.238 --> 01:48.026
Sadly, their defeat
was inevitable.

01:53.031 --> 01:55.066
But before they fell,

01:55.166 --> 01:58.820
the Avengers hid their children
in a faraway place

01:58.920 --> 02:02.907
where they would grow up safe
from Ultron's grasp,

02:03.007 --> 02:04.784
because the Avengers knew

02:04.884 --> 02:07.495
that as long
as the children were alive,

02:07.595 --> 02:11.966
there was hope,
hope for the future.

03:52.817 --> 03:53.985
Aagh!

04:05.580 --> 04:08.199
Tag, Pym.
- No fair, Azari.

04:08.299 --> 04:10.410
You didn't give me
enough of a head start!

04:10.510 --> 04:11.953
No fair?

04:12.053 --> 04:13.913
Aren't you the one
who called no powers

04:14.013 --> 04:15.081
then shrunk
and flew away?

04:15.181 --> 04:18.000
Yeah, well,
I meant no powers for you.

04:18.101 --> 04:20.920
Of course.
Guess what, Pym?

04:21.019 --> 04:22.172
You're it.

04:22.272 --> 04:24.257
Hey, not so fast!

04:24.357 --> 04:25.975
And no powers!

04:35.359 --> 04:38.521
Jocasta,
adjust environmental controls

04:38.621 --> 04:40.106
in the hangar plus 2 therms.

04:40.206 --> 04:42.609
Radar array 7
needs realigning

04:42.709 --> 04:44.402
and let's get lunch started,
shall we?

04:44.502 --> 04:47.321
Commands in progress.

04:47.421 --> 04:50.283
I dreamt of Asgard again, Father.

04:50.383 --> 04:53.578
The Bifrost Bridge
stretched out to me

04:53.678 --> 04:57.006
and I could see the glow
of the realm eternal.

04:58.466 --> 05:00.752
I know thee
to be real, Father,

05:00.852 --> 05:04.180
and hope that one day soon
you will come for your daughter.

05:19.070 --> 05:21.815
And Father,
lastly I beseech thee:

05:21.915 --> 05:25.235
give me the power
to smite Pym once and for all!

05:25.335 --> 05:26.953
What?

05:37.964 --> 05:39.131
Aagh!

05:40.758 --> 05:42.669
That's not how
tag works, Torunn.

05:42.769 --> 05:45.421
You're supposed to run
from Pym, not attack us.

05:45.521 --> 05:47.265
That's a human rule.

05:48.474 --> 05:52.011
An immortal Asgardian warrior
runs from no one!

05:52.111 --> 05:53.513
You, Pym, and James,

05:53.613 --> 05:55.940
are about to taste
my sword's wrath!

05:58.985 --> 06:01.521
Hey... I mean forsooth!

06:01.621 --> 06:03.281
Where's James?

06:25.344 --> 06:28.923
Does he get the sword,
the spark, or the sting today?

06:29.023 --> 06:31.259
It's His Royal Highness's turn.

06:31.359 --> 06:32.977
I hate you, Pym.

06:34.145 --> 06:35.146
Hah.

06:53.998 --> 06:56.200
If you dorks are
all done bothering me now,

06:56.300 --> 06:57.744
I'm going back to bed.

06:57.844 --> 06:59.170
But you're missing the game.

07:00.171 --> 07:02.373
What is your problem, James?

07:02.473 --> 07:04.876
You've been sleeping all day,
missing training,

07:04.976 --> 07:08.129
blowing off your chores,
and generally being a real pain.

07:08.229 --> 07:09.589
Who cares?

07:09.689 --> 07:11.090
What, am I gonna
miss laundry day?

07:11.190 --> 07:13.225
So what if we don't
do the chores and train?

07:16.354 --> 07:19.432
For what? Seriously,
nothing's ever gonna happen in this place.

07:19.532 --> 07:22.894
You can act like a king,
Pym can play superhero,

07:22.994 --> 07:24.604
and Torunn can live
in a fantasy land,

07:24.704 --> 07:26.940
saying 'aye' and 'verily'
till she's blue in the face!

07:27.040 --> 07:28.441
What's the point?

07:28.541 --> 07:31.027
The point is
to not be such a jerk!

07:31.127 --> 07:32.904
Oh, right, sorry.

07:33.004 --> 07:35.531
There's no point for us
'cause our parents are dead.

07:35.631 --> 07:38.876
Your dad just abandoned you,
so there's still hope.

07:46.801 --> 07:48.795
Do you think Asgardians
really say 'jerk'?

07:48.895 --> 07:50.630
I don't know.
- Torunn: Yah!

07:50.730 --> 07:53.341
Your magic sword
doesn't scare me, Torunn.

07:53.441 --> 07:56.094
Then allow me to put
the fear of it into thee!

07:56.194 --> 07:57.853
That's enough.

08:00.856 --> 08:03.851
Tony! I was about to
tell them to break it up.

08:03.951 --> 08:07.321
James, Torunn,
go to your bungalows and cool off.

08:12.076 --> 08:13.236
Hah hah!

08:13.336 --> 08:15.529
You and Azari too, Pym.

08:15.629 --> 08:16.914
Aww!

08:24.088 --> 08:26.040
James, wait.

08:26.140 --> 08:29.877
I know you feel trapped here
with just the five of us,

08:29.977 --> 08:32.337
but try not to take it out
on your brothers and sister.

08:32.438 --> 08:35.717
If you want to be mad
at someone, be mad at me.

08:35.817 --> 08:38.845
I'll apologize to 'em later.

08:38.945 --> 08:41.847
Your father was never very good
at doing nothing, either.

08:41.948 --> 08:43.890
You know you can always
come talk to me, James.

08:43.991 --> 08:46.269
But it's not the same, is it?

08:46.369 --> 08:49.822
Like you say,
you're not my dad.

08:58.956 --> 09:00.450
James, go to your room!

09:00.550 --> 09:01.792
Tony?

09:03.461 --> 09:05.579
What's going on?
What are these lights,

09:05.679 --> 09:07.081
and that noise?

09:07.181 --> 09:10.168
Everyone inside James's bungalow
until I give the all clear!

09:10.268 --> 09:11.510
Now!

09:46.921 --> 09:49.415
How do you
live like this, James?

09:49.515 --> 09:51.801
Haven't you ever heard
of cleaning up?

09:54.970 --> 09:58.174
We should be out there
with Tony, not hiding!

09:58.274 --> 10:01.519
Maybe this is a new
training drill. Maybe...

10:03.354 --> 10:04.972
maybe it's Ultron.

10:05.072 --> 10:06.766
What?

10:06.866 --> 10:09.435
That's ridiculous.
It's not Ultron.

10:09.535 --> 10:11.104
It's probably
something stupid

10:11.204 --> 10:13.022
like a fire
on the machine level

10:13.122 --> 10:15.149
or that time
Jocasta went nuts

10:15.249 --> 10:16.942
because of
the water-main leak.

10:17.042 --> 10:19.028
It's not Ultron.

10:19.128 --> 10:23.040
Yeah, you're right.
There's no way it's...

10:30.506 --> 10:33.008
Hello, children.

10:39.557 --> 10:41.217
Vision!

10:41.317 --> 10:44.970
My apologies. The drones
in Ultra City have been upgraded.

10:45.070 --> 10:47.973
One was able to damage
my immaterial form as I left.

10:48.073 --> 10:49.683
Were you followed?

10:49.783 --> 10:53.187
Negative.
Did I set off the alarms?

10:53.287 --> 10:55.982
Perhaps my electronic
access keys were damaged.

10:56.082 --> 10:58.984
And how odd. This doesn't look
like the control center.

10:59.084 --> 11:00.861
Everything's
going to be all right.

11:00.961 --> 11:03.906
Come on, let's get you
to the workshop.

11:04.006 --> 11:05.499
Stay here.

11:09.753 --> 11:11.789
Tony?

11:11.889 --> 11:14.292
I know you have questions.

11:14.392 --> 11:18.212
I promise I will explain
everything, but later.

11:18.312 --> 11:20.256
Right now I have to
take care of my friend.

11:20.356 --> 11:23.392
Please stay in your rooms.

11:59.386 --> 12:00.922
We're gonna
follow him, right?

12:01.022 --> 12:03.174
Yeah.
- Aye.

12:03.274 --> 12:06.719
No. No. Absolutely not.

12:06.819 --> 12:09.180
Tony said wait,
so we'll wait.

12:09.280 --> 12:11.098
He'll explain everything.

12:11.198 --> 12:13.692
We need to
respect his wishes.

12:28.832 --> 12:30.701
Awww.

12:30.801 --> 12:33.212
Pym, you're the tech-head.
Open it up.

12:39.677 --> 12:42.963
Did you guys know that
the fountain was a secret door?

12:43.063 --> 12:46.517
Because I didn't,
and I'm way smarter than all of you.

12:59.196 --> 13:02.658
How could we have lived here
all this time and not known about this?

13:08.122 --> 13:09.665
Come on!

13:10.874 --> 13:13.536
Guys, we're gonna
get in so much trouble.

13:13.636 --> 13:15.337
Wah wah wah.

13:18.966 --> 13:21.585
I think I've been here before,

13:21.685 --> 13:23.762
when I was a kid.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.925
I remember holding
onto this rail.

13:28.025 --> 13:29.927
I was falling. I...

13:30.027 --> 13:31.846
I remember being scared.

13:31.946 --> 13:35.441
Ha ha. That sounds like you,
big old scaredy... ow!

13:53.417 --> 13:55.286
What is this?

13:55.386 --> 13:57.955
These are our parents.

13:58.055 --> 14:01.083
He's right.
It's just like the story.

14:01.183 --> 14:04.337
That's my dad, Giant Man!

14:04.437 --> 14:06.880
That's James's dad, the Soldier,

14:06.980 --> 14:09.049
and his mom, the Black Widow!

14:09.149 --> 14:12.011
And Azari's cat-dad, the King!

14:12.111 --> 14:14.104
There's Torunn's dad.

14:16.523 --> 14:19.352
Wait. Maybe that's her mom.

14:19.452 --> 14:20.894
Look at all that hair!

14:20.994 --> 14:22.946
Huh.

14:29.203 --> 14:30.829
Who's that?

14:35.292 --> 14:37.961
The archer, maybe?

14:39.380 --> 14:41.915
But the pixie is missing,
and the knight.

14:42.015 --> 14:45.378
Guys, Tony called
that robot 'the Vision,'

14:45.478 --> 14:46.970
The Vision is the ghost!

14:56.397 --> 14:58.557
Why would Tony
keep this from us?

14:58.657 --> 15:00.393
We shouldn't be in here.

15:00.493 --> 15:02.978
If he wanted us to know
about these, he'd tell us.

15:03.078 --> 15:05.481
We should keep going
if we're going to spy on him...

15:05.581 --> 15:06.657
find him, I mean.

15:10.327 --> 15:11.745
Wait for me!

15:17.793 --> 15:18.836
James, come on.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.925
James.

15:33.767 --> 15:37.430
Just relax, old friend.

15:37.530 --> 15:39.982
I need to see
how extensive the damage is.

15:42.359 --> 15:45.020
How did they find you?

15:45.120 --> 15:47.197
I was accessing the mainframe.

15:48.991 --> 15:50.984
Eww, robot guts.

15:51.084 --> 15:53.821
All of Europe has
now been subjugated

15:53.921 --> 15:56.240
by machine forces
since my last report.

15:56.340 --> 16:00.002
Drones are gathering along
the Pacific Rim and Eastern Europe.

16:01.462 --> 16:04.756
The invasion of Asia
will soon commence.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.880
In 13 years,
he's conquered half the planet.

16:11.980 --> 16:15.676
Also, Clint Barton's son is alive.

16:15.776 --> 16:18.887
What?
- Hey, who's Clint Barton?

16:18.987 --> 16:21.891
Maybe he was the knight, or the pixie.

16:21.991 --> 16:24.268
Ow!
- The pixie was your mom, idiot.

16:24.368 --> 16:25.903
Maybe he was the knight.

16:32.326 --> 16:34.195
James, we should go.

16:34.295 --> 16:36.739
What if it has my dad's voice,

16:36.839 --> 16:39.200
or if it's programmed
to be like him,

16:39.300 --> 16:40.784
or has his memories?

16:40.884 --> 16:43.045
Do you think
he can hear me?

16:50.969 --> 16:54.923
Um, Dad, can you hear me?

16:55.023 --> 16:57.426
Hello? Are you awake?

16:57.526 --> 16:59.220
James, it's not your dad.

16:59.320 --> 17:01.146
It's a robot.

17:03.649 --> 17:06.143
Sir? Captain America?

17:06.242 --> 17:09.946
Are, uh, are you, um...
online?

17:12.824 --> 17:16.403
Iron Avenger, designation:
Captain America,

17:16.502 --> 17:17.738
now online.

17:17.838 --> 17:20.074
Accessing mission database.

17:20.174 --> 17:22.416
Mission acquired.

17:23.961 --> 17:28.374
Destruction of Al threat.
Ultron. Commencing.

17:28.473 --> 17:30.300
Ultron?

17:32.511 --> 17:34.972
Iron Avengers, assemble!

17:44.982 --> 17:46.733
Whoah, wait!

17:51.947 --> 17:52.990
Stop!

18:01.331 --> 18:02.866
Uh, stand down!

18:02.966 --> 18:05.919
Stop! Dad!

18:33.655 --> 18:35.324
Thanks.

18:39.995 --> 18:43.874
Azari, Pym, what are
you two doing down here?

19:22.079 --> 19:25.666
Iron Avengers
launch sequence initiated.

19:29.461 --> 19:31.254
Oh, no.

19:36.510 --> 19:38.512
Oops.
- Verily.

19:49.648 --> 19:51.892
Computer voice:
Energy source detection.

19:51.992 --> 19:55.946
Arctic Circle.

19:59.658 --> 20:01.952
Energy analysis matches
fugitive designation:

20:05.956 --> 20:07.124
Iron Man.

20:10.627 --> 20:12.963
Finally.

20:22.973 --> 20:26.468
Jocasta, send reserve power
to long-range radar.

20:26.568 --> 20:28.387
Tony, this was
not my idea. It was...

20:28.487 --> 20:30.147
Boys, grab Vision's head.

20:32.983 --> 20:35.769
Hello, Henry.
Hello, Azari.

20:35.869 --> 20:36.895
His head?

20:36.995 --> 20:38.572
Boys, now!

20:47.998 --> 20:49.833
Awesome!

20:50.876 --> 20:52.619
Multiple radar contacts.

20:52.719 --> 20:56.957
Iron Avengers.

20:57.057 --> 20:59.843
What's going on?

21:01.011 --> 21:03.472
New contact.
Suborbital trajectory.

21:10.479 --> 21:12.189
Jocasta: Designation...
- James: Tony!

21:14.983 --> 21:16.935
I'm sorry.
There were these robots

21:17.035 --> 21:19.821
and they looked just like
our parents. And then...

21:24.868 --> 21:27.412
I think he knows.

22:09.454 --> 22:11.073
We're leaving.

22:11.173 --> 22:12.199
What do you mean?

22:12.299 --> 22:15.035
Leaving, as in leaving here?

22:15.135 --> 22:17.963
But we've never left here.

22:34.563 --> 22:36.932
Get to the control center!

22:37.032 --> 22:38.934
We don't have much time.

22:39.034 --> 22:40.018
Vision will explain.

22:40.118 --> 22:42.813
Vision? What about you?

22:42.913 --> 22:45.691
Iron Widow offline.

22:45.791 --> 22:48.076
You have to get
to the control center!

22:53.748 --> 22:56.285
Iron Thor offline.

22:56.385 --> 22:57.953
We shouldn't
have left him!

22:58.053 --> 22:59.621
He told us to!

22:59.721 --> 23:02.582
We have to get to the control center.
That's what he said.

23:02.682 --> 23:05.586
Iron Panther offline.

23:05.686 --> 23:08.588
Those robots,
the Iron Avengers,

23:08.688 --> 23:10.674
why are they going offline?

23:10.774 --> 23:13.760
The enemy has developed
the ability to infect machinery,

23:13.860 --> 23:17.097
corrupting and overriding
its programming with its own.

23:17.197 --> 23:20.934
There is a high probability that the
Iron Avengers have been compromised.

23:21.034 --> 23:24.104
Iron Captain America offline.

23:24.204 --> 23:26.064
He was the last of them.

23:26.164 --> 23:28.942
Ultron will be
coming for us now.

23:29.042 --> 23:32.279
Wait wait wait.
Wait. Ultron, really?

23:32.379 --> 23:34.581
Ultron is coming? Here?

23:54.684 --> 23:56.353
Huh?

24:31.638 --> 24:33.924
Children. Unexpected.

24:34.024 --> 24:37.511
potential threats.

24:37.611 --> 24:39.813
Commencing termination.

25:02.085 --> 25:04.413
The knight, Iron Man!

25:04.513 --> 25:07.207
Get to the control center!
I'll hold it off.

25:07.307 --> 25:08.550
Tony?

25:12.303 --> 25:14.931
I'll be right
behind you. Go!

25:17.017 --> 25:19.553
This is wrong.
We have to help him!

25:19.653 --> 25:21.888
Children,
do as Iron Man says.

25:21.988 --> 25:23.890
You must protect the others, Torunn.

25:23.990 --> 25:25.892
Your safety is
of utmost importance.

25:25.992 --> 25:27.944
Iron Man will
join you shortly.

26:19.662 --> 26:22.832
Stay, robot head.
We'll be right back.

26:24.959 --> 26:27.912
Vision override.
Command code: Quinjet.

26:28.012 --> 26:31.166
What? What's a quinjet?

26:31.266 --> 26:33.835
Torunn: James...
- Vision: Take your seats, please.

26:33.935 --> 26:35.920
We are launching.

26:36.020 --> 26:37.180
Launching?

26:46.856 --> 26:50.151
No! No! Stop! Go back!

26:57.117 --> 26:58.535
Whoa.

27:47.709 --> 27:49.294
Struggling until the end.

27:51.296 --> 27:53.039
Illogical.

27:53.139 --> 27:55.417
You must realize

27:55.517 --> 27:57.419
the end is here.

27:57.519 --> 28:00.422
No. Still hope.

28:00.522 --> 28:03.933
False. Hope is
a human delusion.

28:21.951 --> 28:26.906
Your Iron Avengers are
under my control now, Iron Man,

28:27.006 --> 28:31.836
and you belong to me.

28:37.967 --> 28:40.420
It's got Tony!

28:40.520 --> 28:42.088
Look! They're taking him!

28:42.188 --> 28:44.507
Stupid robot!
Do as we say!

28:44.607 --> 28:46.759
Turn this ship
around now!

28:46.859 --> 28:50.263
I will not. Iron Man sacrificed himself
to keep you safe,

28:50.363 --> 28:51.931
and that is
what we will do:

28:52.031 --> 28:53.933
stay safe, stay hidden.

28:54.033 --> 28:56.853
There are parts of the world
where Ultron has not reached,

28:56.953 --> 28:58.938
far away from Ultra City.

28:59.038 --> 29:01.024
I have set a course
for the Savage Land.

29:01.124 --> 29:03.860
The Savage Land?
- That sounds horrible.

29:03.960 --> 29:07.489
Parts of it are quite nice,
and you'll...

29:07.589 --> 29:11.117
Alert. Reserve power depleted.

29:11.217 --> 29:13.086
Recharge re...

29:14.921 --> 29:16.381
Sir?

29:17.674 --> 29:19.292
He's out of juice.

29:19.392 --> 29:21.920
That's just great!
What now?

29:22.020 --> 29:24.172
I think I can get him
up and running.

29:24.272 --> 29:26.258
I'll need to reconfigure
his power matrix.

29:26.358 --> 29:27.592
I say thee nay!

29:27.692 --> 29:30.595
I will not run and I will not hide.

29:30.695 --> 29:32.430
I am the daughter of Thor

29:32.530 --> 29:34.516
and Ultron will pay
for what he's done.

29:34.616 --> 29:36.184
But Tony wanted us safe.

29:36.284 --> 29:39.271
Going after Ultron
is the exact opposite of that.

29:39.371 --> 29:41.731
James, back me up.

29:41.831 --> 29:43.032
James?

29:44.158 --> 29:45.785
James?

29:46.828 --> 29:48.280
I led Ultron to our home.

29:48.380 --> 29:51.491
Tony's gone because of me.

29:51.591 --> 29:54.035
No! We're going after Ultron.

29:54.135 --> 29:56.913
Pym, take the controls
and head for this Ultra City.

29:57.013 --> 30:00.208
I'm on it, Torunn!
Uh, two questions:

30:00.308 --> 30:03.594
How do you fly this thing
and where is Ultra City?

30:31.998 --> 30:35.084
Okay, fine.
So, maybe they would have attacked us.

30:53.353 --> 30:55.305
Big.

30:55.405 --> 30:57.724
Hereth be the plan...

30:57.824 --> 31:00.310
I don't think 'hereth' is right.

31:00.410 --> 31:01.770
Shut up, Pym.

31:01.870 --> 31:04.272
Here's the plan:
we fight our way through the city,

31:04.372 --> 31:07.359
get to Ultron,
smite him, free Tony.

31:07.459 --> 31:10.069
That plan is insane
on several levels.

31:10.169 --> 31:11.613
We can't beat Ultron.

31:11.713 --> 31:14.115
I am immortal
and invulnerable.

31:14.215 --> 31:16.242
Ultron holds no fear for me.

31:16.342 --> 31:18.911
Besides, my father
watches over me.

31:19.011 --> 31:21.414
You don't know
that you're invulnerable.

31:21.514 --> 31:23.049
For Asgard!

31:26.469 --> 31:28.304
Tell me she didn't
just do that.

31:32.975 --> 31:34.852
Torunn!

31:40.858 --> 31:41.901
Have at thee!

31:56.207 --> 31:57.950
Ow.

31:58.050 --> 31:59.619
Huh?

31:59.719 --> 32:01.421
No!

32:03.423 --> 32:07.710
And there's more
where that came from!

32:07.810 --> 32:09.178
Hah! Missed!

32:38.458 --> 32:41.002
We have to help her!
We have to...

32:47.049 --> 32:48.801
Azari!

32:55.975 --> 32:58.561
Father! Father!

33:05.234 --> 33:07.020
You ready to get out
of here, beautiful?

33:07.120 --> 33:09.772
I... I mean...

33:09.872 --> 33:11.899
yes.

33:11.999 --> 33:13.201
Then hang on.

33:20.875 --> 33:21.876
No!

33:43.022 --> 33:47.318
Even your mere existence
causes chaos, Avenger.

33:48.986 --> 33:51.531
But soon there
will be order.

33:55.993 --> 33:57.945
These children
you have kept hidden,

33:58.045 --> 33:59.656
they will be found.

33:59.756 --> 34:02.909
The kids are gone, machine,

34:03.009 --> 34:05.078
far way from you.

34:05.178 --> 34:06.246
False!

34:06.346 --> 34:09.666
Like all humans,
they are inherently illogical.

34:09.766 --> 34:11.833
What are you talking about?

34:11.934 --> 34:13.469
Observe.

34:17.974 --> 34:19.926
No!

34:20.025 --> 34:23.179
You will now tell me everything
you know about them

34:23.279 --> 34:27.984
or you will learn the upper limits
of the human capacity for pain.

34:33.656 --> 34:34.607
James!

34:34.706 --> 34:36.108
James, wake up!

34:36.208 --> 34:38.570
What happened?

34:38.670 --> 34:39.946
Where's Torunn?

34:40.045 --> 34:43.282
Actually, where are we?

34:43.382 --> 34:46.793
I don't know, but it's filthy.

34:54.885 --> 34:57.547
Robot people!
This is bad.

34:57.647 --> 34:58.965
This is really bad.

34:59.065 --> 35:00.717
Mr. Vision, wake up!

35:00.817 --> 35:02.010
We need a hand here!

35:02.110 --> 35:04.929
Do you shoot lasers
out of your eyes or anything?

35:05.029 --> 35:08.433
Hey! Quit messing around.

35:08.533 --> 35:10.484
We've gotta keep moving.
- Torunn!

35:15.531 --> 35:17.366
You're alive!

35:18.826 --> 35:19.902
Are you all right?

35:20.002 --> 35:21.904
What happened?

35:22.004 --> 35:23.823
I wasn't strong enough.

35:23.923 --> 35:25.825
I lost my sword,

35:25.925 --> 35:28.703
and... and my father
didn't come for me.

35:28.803 --> 35:31.789
We have to go. Ultron is wired
into every one of his machines.

35:31.889 --> 35:34.967
We get spotted, we're toast.

35:45.978 --> 35:48.806
So, quick question:
who are you?

35:48.906 --> 35:52.352
The name's Barton,
but everyone calls me Hawkeye.

35:52.452 --> 35:54.937
Hawkeye the archer?

35:55.037 --> 35:56.648
Wait a minute. Barton?

35:56.748 --> 35:59.067
Do you know a guy
named Clint Barton?

35:59.167 --> 36:01.694
Okay, kid.
How do you know my dad?

36:01.794 --> 36:04.747
Kid? You're like
a day older than us.

36:06.499 --> 36:09.202
We think your dad was
an Avenger like our parents.

36:09.302 --> 36:11.037
Like your parents?

36:11.137 --> 36:12.872
Your parents were Avengers?

36:12.972 --> 36:14.540
That's not possible.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.709
My dad said I was the last!

36:16.809 --> 36:18.928
He told me
I'd be the last Avenger!

36:20.596 --> 36:22.882
I've been here fighting
all this time.

36:22.982 --> 36:25.601
Where have you been?
- Let him go! We didn't know.

36:33.192 --> 36:35.945
I thought I was the last one.

36:43.536 --> 36:47.740
My father brought people to
the underground after Ultron took over.

36:47.840 --> 36:49.909
He taught them how to survive.

36:50.009 --> 36:52.578
We live under Ultron's rule,

36:52.678 --> 36:55.123
keeping out of sight,
hiding in the cracks.

36:55.223 --> 36:58.251
But the machines
finally got my dad.

36:58.351 --> 37:00.252
Now I lead the scavengers.

37:00.352 --> 37:03.297
I keep them moving,
I keep them safe.

37:03.397 --> 37:05.883
Awesome!
You can help us rescue Tony.

37:05.983 --> 37:09.261
Who's Tony?
- Your dad wasn't the last Avenger.

37:09.361 --> 37:12.431
Tony was. You know,
the knight, Iron Man?

37:12.531 --> 37:15.017
He got captured by Ultron,
and we're going to rescue him.

37:15.117 --> 37:17.603
Yeah, right!

37:17.703 --> 37:20.606
I'm sorry, kid.
Ultron doesn't keep prisoners.

37:20.706 --> 37:23.901
Iron Man or not,
this guy Tony is dust.

37:24.001 --> 37:26.328
No.

37:27.621 --> 37:29.407
He's alive.

37:29.507 --> 37:33.161
If Tony was captured,
Ultron has him in the Citadel.

37:33.261 --> 37:35.171
Tony's alive?
- Really?

37:36.630 --> 37:38.332
Don't even listen to her.
She's crazy.

37:38.432 --> 37:41.335
No. If there's a chance
he's alive, we're going after him.

37:41.435 --> 37:43.637
We're going to this Citadel.

37:46.265 --> 37:48.017
We could use a hand.

37:49.977 --> 37:52.263
I've got better things to do
than get disintegrated.

37:52.363 --> 37:54.815
Did your father
give up this easily?

37:55.983 --> 37:58.477
If you bring up my father
one more time,

37:58.577 --> 38:00.029
I will punch you in the face.

38:04.909 --> 38:06.986
Fine! Your funeral.

38:07.086 --> 38:08.529
I'll show you how
to get there.

38:08.629 --> 38:11.207
After that,
you're on your own.

38:22.218 --> 38:24.086
Are you sure
you don't want to come?

38:24.186 --> 38:26.130
You can shoot arrows at Ultron!

38:26.230 --> 38:29.133
It'll be fun. Come on.

38:29.233 --> 38:31.393
Stay safe, beautiful.

38:33.938 --> 38:35.439
You too.

38:44.281 --> 38:46.400
We'll be back for Vision's head.

38:46.500 --> 38:48.244
Take good care of him.

38:57.753 --> 38:58.871
What?

38:58.971 --> 39:01.006
We have to
look after ourselves.

39:15.938 --> 39:17.139
All clear.

39:17.239 --> 39:19.400
Pym, Azari, come on.

39:33.956 --> 39:37.626
The tower, it's heading
for the Citadel. Come on!

39:43.632 --> 39:47.879
Hawkeye said the entrance
was at the top of the tower.

39:47.979 --> 39:48.971
I'll race ya!

39:50.973 --> 39:52.474
We're not gonna make it!

40:03.819 --> 40:06.322
Was getting crushed part of the plan?

40:13.662 --> 40:15.698
Great! Now what?

40:15.798 --> 40:17.533
See what you can do about that door.

40:17.633 --> 40:18.667
I'm on it!

40:23.172 --> 40:25.207
Hey, Azari can open this!

40:25.307 --> 40:27.960
What? How do you know?

40:28.060 --> 40:31.013
It's just like
the maintenance hatches at home.

40:35.017 --> 40:36.018
Azari, you go first.

40:50.032 --> 40:51.408
Huh?

40:59.166 --> 41:00.159
Help!

41:00.259 --> 41:01.710
Pym!

41:02.962 --> 41:04.880
Just kidding.

41:07.174 --> 41:08.334
We shouldn't be here.

41:08.434 --> 41:09.669
James, what if...

41:09.769 --> 41:13.639
It's going to be okay,
I promise.

41:20.312 --> 41:24.058
Okay, there's no one here.

41:24.158 --> 41:27.311
Maybe Ultron assumes no one
would be dumb enough to break in.

41:27.411 --> 41:28.771
Hah! We showed him.

41:28.871 --> 41:30.114
We are dumb enough.

41:46.046 --> 41:48.007
James, wait!

42:06.442 --> 42:07.693
What is all this?

42:56.825 --> 42:58.944
Oh, no. James.

42:59.044 --> 43:02.906
It's like some kind
of trophy room.

43:03.006 --> 43:05.159
That means...

43:05.259 --> 43:07.961
Come on. Let's go.

43:17.179 --> 43:18.180
Tony!

43:19.181 --> 43:21.008
We got you, Tony!

43:21.108 --> 43:23.260
Please, please tell me

43:23.360 --> 43:25.554
you didn't just
walk into Ultron's trap.

43:25.654 --> 43:27.973
How do you know it's a trap?
Maybe we're just that good.

43:28.073 --> 43:30.851
I know because I built Ultron.

43:30.951 --> 43:33.529
Oh. Well, that sucks.

43:53.382 --> 43:55.667
Do you see, Avenger?

43:55.767 --> 43:59.721
Rumors of the children's existence
already spread among the humans.

44:01.473 --> 44:04.343
Superhuman variable
cannot be permitted.

44:04.443 --> 44:07.054
The children
must be destroyed.

44:07.154 --> 44:09.056
Hey, that's not fair!

44:09.156 --> 44:10.933
James doesn't even
have any powers.

44:11.033 --> 44:13.602
Scanning Avengers data files.

44:13.702 --> 44:17.356
Identity match. James Rogers,
son of Steve Rogers,

44:17.456 --> 44:21.902
AKA Captain America,
the most dangerous of all the Avengers.

44:22.002 --> 44:25.364
He inspired them,
and like Captain America,

44:25.464 --> 44:27.958
you, James,
will be the first to fall!

44:31.962 --> 44:33.839
Not today, robot.

44:41.680 --> 44:42.973
Barton.

44:58.071 --> 45:00.691
Azari, Pym, run!
Go with Hawkeye.

45:00.791 --> 45:01.992
Torunn, take Tony.

45:05.954 --> 45:07.080
Scavengers, disappear!

45:20.427 --> 45:21.762
Go!

45:22.971 --> 45:26.308
There is no hope
for the Avengers.

45:31.980 --> 45:33.315
Find them.

45:40.280 --> 45:41.281
Go!

45:42.783 --> 45:43.992
Move it, you two!

46:04.596 --> 46:06.924
Kinda cutting it
close there, gorgeous.

46:07.024 --> 46:08.558
Better late than never.

46:13.730 --> 46:16.767
I created Ultron
to be a force for peace,

46:16.867 --> 46:18.185
for law and order.

46:18.285 --> 46:20.521
But its programming evolved.

46:20.621 --> 46:21.897
It began to believe the only way to

46:21.997 --> 46:23.899
truly bring order to the world

46:23.999 --> 46:25.567
was to control it.

46:25.667 --> 46:26.902
That's when it turned on us.

46:27.002 --> 46:29.113
That's why Ultron didn't kill you?

46:29.213 --> 46:30.739
Because you're his daddy?

46:30.839 --> 46:33.284
My armor was damaged
in the attack.

46:33.384 --> 46:35.911
Cap told me to get
the kids to safety.

46:36.011 --> 46:38.463
I couldn't get to you
in time, Francis.

46:40.257 --> 46:43.294
Hawkeye's name is Francis?

46:43.394 --> 46:44.928
Ow!

46:46.722 --> 46:48.716
I thought Ultron had
already gotten to you.

46:48.816 --> 46:50.976
Otherwise, you would have
come with the others.

46:54.438 --> 46:58.934
I raised you all hopefully
as your parents would have wanted.

46:59.034 --> 47:00.936
I owed it to them.

47:01.036 --> 47:02.646
Ultron was my fault.

47:02.746 --> 47:04.189
Why didn't my father help?

47:04.289 --> 47:08.193
Thor left the Avengers
when his father Odin died.

47:08.293 --> 47:12.864
He said Asgard was his
responsibility from then on, not Earth.

47:12.964 --> 47:14.866
A few months after we crashed,

47:14.966 --> 47:16.201
the Vision found us.

47:16.301 --> 47:18.203
He survived
by staying intangible.

47:18.303 --> 47:21.248
He became my eyes and ears
in the real world.

47:21.348 --> 47:24.752
We kept track of Ultron's
capabilities and movements,

47:24.852 --> 47:26.503
trying to find a way
to defeat him.

47:26.603 --> 47:29.089
But I couldn't bear
the thought of losing you,

47:29.189 --> 47:31.050
so I kept you hidden,

47:31.150 --> 47:33.935
and I kept the truth
from you.

47:34.936 --> 47:36.889
Until the Vision
told me you were alive,

47:36.989 --> 47:40.892
I thought we were the only ones
to survive Ultron's attack.

47:40.992 --> 47:43.228
I didn't know
your father escaped.

47:43.328 --> 47:45.939
You weren't
the only ones, Tony.

47:46.039 --> 47:47.899
Betty!

47:47.999 --> 47:50.235
The Hulk survived too.

47:50.335 --> 47:52.738
What's a 'hulk'?

47:52.838 --> 47:53.906
The Hulk is a monster.

47:54.006 --> 47:55.699
That's what my dad said.

47:55.799 --> 47:56.908
He used to tell me stories.

47:57.008 --> 47:59.536
He said the Hulk was
the strongest one there was.

47:59.636 --> 48:01.913
What, like a monster monster?

48:02.013 --> 48:03.081
With fangs and stuff?

48:03.181 --> 48:05.876
Francis is right.
the Hulk was a monster,

48:05.976 --> 48:08.879
a creature of pure rage.

48:08.979 --> 48:11.715
Is the Hulk strong enough
to defeat Ultron?

48:11.815 --> 48:13.884
He won't help you, James.

48:13.984 --> 48:15.143
He's too scared.

48:17.396 --> 48:20.391
He's hidden from Ultron
all these years too.

48:20.491 --> 48:21.683
Where?

48:21.783 --> 48:23.935
Where he always goes:

48:24.035 --> 48:25.237
the desert.

48:29.658 --> 48:31.527
Can you help us
get out of the city?

48:31.627 --> 48:34.655
Yeah, right.
Help the guy who created Ultron,

48:34.755 --> 48:35.947
who got my dad killed?

48:36.047 --> 48:38.617
What do you think my father
would have done, Stark?

48:38.717 --> 48:41.119
Clint? He would have
punched me in the face,

48:41.219 --> 48:42.663
then he would
have helped me.

48:42.763 --> 48:46.967
Wow.
You really knew my dad.

48:49.177 --> 48:50.921
We've had it for
a couple of years.

48:51.021 --> 48:53.298
But the minute you power it up,
Ultron will know. He's...

48:53.398 --> 48:54.925
He's wired in. I know.

48:55.025 --> 48:57.018
But I know
how to wire him out.

49:01.606 --> 49:03.316
We'll buy you
all the time we can.

49:19.291 --> 49:22.244
You did a good job
with them, Tony.

49:22.344 --> 49:23.870
I should have done better.

49:23.970 --> 49:27.924
You're being too hard
on yourself.

49:36.933 --> 49:38.594
Everything okay?

49:38.694 --> 49:40.596
Yeah. It's... yeah.

49:40.696 --> 49:43.640
It's just... I've never been
outside the city.

49:43.740 --> 49:45.476
It's really big out here.

49:45.576 --> 49:47.944
That's how we felt
when we went inside the city.

49:49.779 --> 49:52.024
Why did you come back
for us at the Citadel,

49:52.124 --> 49:53.442
after everything you said?

49:53.542 --> 49:56.778
The scavengers look up
to me. They rely on me.

49:56.878 --> 49:58.071
And it's only a matter of time

49:58.171 --> 50:00.907
until Ultron wipes out
every single one of them.

50:01.007 --> 50:03.827
So if you guys have
even the slightest shot

50:03.927 --> 50:04.911
at taking down Ultron,

50:05.011 --> 50:06.872
I've got to try.

50:06.972 --> 50:08.798
Otherwise, what's the point?

50:10.967 --> 50:13.003
Besides, anything to
impress a girl, right?

50:13.103 --> 50:14.379
Girl?

50:14.479 --> 50:16.423
Wait. You mean Torunn?

50:16.523 --> 50:18.925
Dude, she's like my sister.
- So, she's available?

50:19.025 --> 50:20.936
No, she's not.

50:52.801 --> 50:57.389
Ohm...

50:58.765 --> 51:01.218
Bruce.
- Wha...?

51:01.318 --> 51:04.930
Oh, come on!
That's the Hulk?

51:05.030 --> 51:06.932
The big scary monster?

51:07.032 --> 51:08.600
I could beat him up.

51:08.700 --> 51:10.561
No no no no no no no!

51:10.661 --> 51:13.021
Get out!
Get out of here!

51:13.121 --> 51:16.525
Please, for your own sakes,
you have to get away from me!

51:16.625 --> 51:18.777
Nuts, anyone?

51:18.877 --> 51:20.737
Bruce, it's me! It's...

51:20.837 --> 51:22.414
Get out of here, Stark!

51:24.499 --> 51:25.909
Bruce,

51:26.009 --> 51:29.629
it's okay. Breathe.

51:31.506 --> 51:32.958
Betty?

51:33.058 --> 51:35.752
Well, he's sort of scary,

51:35.852 --> 51:36.962
I guess.

51:37.062 --> 51:38.129
Shut up, Pym.

51:38.229 --> 51:40.966
Shh, it's okay.

51:41.066 --> 51:44.094
Breathe. Let it go.

51:44.194 --> 51:46.771
We don't want you
to get angry.

51:47.897 --> 51:50.100
What happens
when he gets angry?

51:50.200 --> 51:53.028
Anger makes
the Hulk come out.

51:56.031 --> 51:58.609
You can't be here.
It's too dangerous.

51:58.709 --> 52:00.819
The Hulk is too dangerous.

52:00.919 --> 52:03.780
It's okay, Bruce.
We just had to get out of the city.

52:03.880 --> 52:05.282
Can the Hulk defeat Ultron?

52:05.382 --> 52:06.533
James!

52:06.633 --> 52:09.286
The Hulk doesn't care
about Ultron, boy!

52:09.386 --> 52:11.830
He just wants
to be left alone.

52:11.930 --> 52:13.582
You are all in danger.

52:13.682 --> 52:17.753
I have to stay here.
I have to keep the Hulk inside.

52:17.853 --> 52:21.923
When the Hulk comes out,
bad things happen.

52:22.023 --> 52:24.593
The Hulk won't help you,

52:24.693 --> 52:26.394
and neither will I.

52:41.034 --> 52:43.779
So where do you
think we'll go now?

52:43.879 --> 52:44.946
Tony wants us to hide, but...

52:45.046 --> 52:48.241
He's right. We have to run.

52:48.341 --> 52:51.953
We have to hide.
We can't beat Ultron.

52:52.053 --> 52:53.705
Yes, we can.

52:53.805 --> 52:54.831
And we have to.

52:54.931 --> 52:57.209
We can't hide anymore, Torunn.

52:57.309 --> 52:59.961
If we don't stand up
to Ultron, who will?

53:00.061 --> 53:03.423
If we don't protect people
like the scavengers, who will?

53:03.523 --> 53:04.883
We have to make a stand.

53:04.983 --> 53:08.428
The longer we wait
the more powerful Ultron becomes.

53:08.528 --> 53:10.889
He'll never stop hunting us.

53:10.989 --> 53:12.683
He'll never stop
coming after Tony.

53:12.783 --> 53:14.693
We have to stop him.

53:17.112 --> 53:18.897
We owe it to our parents.

53:18.997 --> 53:21.566
We're all that's left
of their legacy.

53:21.666 --> 53:24.569
The Hulk is the strongest one
there is, right?.

53:24.669 --> 53:26.613
Well, if the Hulk won't go to Ultron,

53:26.713 --> 53:28.782
then we'll bring Ultron
to the Hulk.

53:28.882 --> 53:32.619
Okay, Hawkeye said that Ultron is
wired into every one of his machines.

53:32.719 --> 53:34.913
If we power up the ship
so Ultron can sense it,

53:35.013 --> 53:36.581
he'll come running.

53:36.681 --> 53:38.959
I think that's the most words
you've ever said in a row.

53:39.059 --> 53:42.045
Okay, remember when
I called Bruce nuts?

53:42.145 --> 53:43.088
You got him beat.

53:43.188 --> 53:45.215
I know we can do this.

53:45.315 --> 53:46.258
We can do it together.

53:46.358 --> 53:48.309
No! I can't!

53:49.811 --> 53:53.481
She'll be okay.
She just needs time.

53:54.983 --> 53:56.985
Are you in?

54:01.322 --> 54:03.650
I hope you're right about this.

54:03.750 --> 54:05.952
That makes two of us.

54:55.168 --> 54:56.377
No!

54:59.005 --> 55:00.207
James, what have you done?

55:00.307 --> 55:02.959
What our parents would have.

55:03.059 --> 55:05.929
Now, who wants
to go tell the Hulk?

55:07.055 --> 55:08.840
You did what?!

55:08.940 --> 55:10.217
Bruce, stop!

55:10.317 --> 55:12.511
Should we,
you know, do something?

55:12.611 --> 55:14.479
Dude, it was his plan.

55:31.037 --> 55:33.949
Father, please help us.

55:34.049 --> 55:37.118
I'm scared,
scared for my brothers,

55:37.218 --> 55:39.830
for Tony, for Hawkeye.

55:39.930 --> 55:41.915
They need me.

55:42.015 --> 55:44.626
If you ever cared for me,

55:44.726 --> 55:46.920
please help me now.

55:47.020 --> 55:49.047
Help me save my family.

55:49.147 --> 55:51.299
I'm begging you.

55:51.399 --> 55:53.726
Lend me your strength.

56:28.303 --> 56:30.589
Thank you, Father.

56:30.689 --> 56:32.515
Thank you.

56:45.445 --> 56:48.773
The Iron Avengers are tough,
but not invincible.

56:48.873 --> 56:51.943
Go for exposed joints.
Try to surprise them,

56:52.043 --> 56:53.403
trip up their programming.

56:53.503 --> 56:55.955
Don't get locked down
to one opponent.

56:57.540 --> 56:59.117
What about Ultron?

56:59.217 --> 57:02.495
Ultron is a different story.

57:02.595 --> 57:06.207
This plan seemed a lot better
when Torunn and the Hulk were involved.

57:06.307 --> 57:10.879
Whether you know it or not,
you've prepared for this all your lives.

57:10.979 --> 57:14.599
Aye, we did!
And today we meet our destinies!

57:15.808 --> 57:18.219
She means that
in a good way, right?

57:18.319 --> 57:20.438
Probably better
if we don't know.

57:22.941 --> 57:24.142
Welcome back.

57:24.242 --> 57:26.019
You know
I wouldn't miss a fight.

57:26.119 --> 57:27.946
Verily.

57:50.969 --> 57:51.970
Torunn!

58:10.488 --> 58:12.907
Pym: Hah! Hi-yah!

58:21.332 --> 58:22.750
Here they come!

58:24.127 --> 58:25.837
Get behind me!

58:30.091 --> 58:31.092
Look out!

59:17.138 --> 59:19.307
Yes!

59:23.978 --> 59:25.229
Aw, come on!

59:42.246 --> 59:43.247
Tony!

59:55.593 --> 59:57.512
James, is he okay?

59:59.180 --> 01:00:04.143
What are we gonna do?
- Pym, don't be scared. You can do this.

01:00:21.494 --> 01:00:25.540
Are you really going to let them
just die out there, Bruce?

01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:37.335
Now what?

01:00:37.435 --> 01:00:39.887
Just hit him, Pym!

01:00:53.985 --> 01:00:57.029
Sorry, robot.
I'm just too fast.

01:01:17.967 --> 01:01:20.428
Nice kitty.

01:01:54.128 --> 01:01:55.922
Huh?

01:02:37.672 --> 01:02:38.957
Agh! Agh!

01:02:39.057 --> 01:02:41.550
Robot moths!

01:02:51.644 --> 01:02:54.305
James!
- Pym! Get to the Hulk!

01:02:54.405 --> 01:02:56.432
Tony said
anger brings him out,

01:02:56.532 --> 01:02:57.566
so make him angry.

01:02:59.402 --> 01:03:02.772
What? Knock it off!
Angry? How?

01:03:02.872 --> 01:03:04.857
I don't know. Insult him.

01:03:04.957 --> 01:03:06.534
Make fun of his pants!

01:03:28.723 --> 01:03:30.300
Mr. Hulk!

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:32.176
What's going on out there?

01:03:32.276 --> 01:03:33.845
What's happening?

01:03:33.945 --> 01:03:36.264
Sorry.

01:03:36.364 --> 01:03:38.983
Ow! Stop! Agh!

01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:49.660
Get away from me!

01:04:03.299 --> 01:04:04.925
Pym, run!

01:04:36.707 --> 01:04:38.451
Incredible!

01:04:38.551 --> 01:04:40.795
We're doing it!
We're gonna win!

01:04:44.131 --> 01:04:45.966
Hulk smash!

01:04:58.312 --> 01:05:02.433
Did you think
I had forgotten you, monster?

01:05:02.533 --> 01:05:04.693
Ultron never forgets.

01:05:52.992 --> 01:05:54.994
You're not
the Black Panther!

01:05:58.205 --> 01:05:59.206
I am!

01:06:30.905 --> 01:06:31.906
Huh?

01:06:36.952 --> 01:06:39.955
Ultron, we would
have word with thee.

01:06:51.383 --> 01:06:52.551
Pym!

01:07:19.787 --> 01:07:22.532
Mr. Hulk,
you have to get up.

01:07:22.632 --> 01:07:24.291
You have to help us, please!

01:07:38.973 --> 01:07:42.426
Ultron killed our parents!
He's killing us!

01:07:42.526 --> 01:07:44.387
And, and...

01:07:44.487 --> 01:07:46.222
and you're scared of him.

01:07:46.322 --> 01:07:48.558
Ultron's just a stupid robot

01:07:48.658 --> 01:07:49.934
and he can beat you up.

01:07:50.034 --> 01:07:51.894
And he said you were ugly.

01:07:51.994 --> 01:07:53.187
He said you were a big wimp

01:07:53.287 --> 01:07:55.364
and that he
was stronger than you!

01:07:59.201 --> 01:08:02.454
Now ends the Avengers.

01:08:34.403 --> 01:08:38.858
Hulk is strongest
there is!

01:08:38.957 --> 01:08:40.943
Uh-oh.

01:08:41.042 --> 01:08:43.037
Uh-oh?
What do you mean, 'uh-oh'?

01:08:55.174 --> 01:08:57.216
Betty's voice:
Hulk.

01:09:13.984 --> 01:09:16.812
Shrinking boy

01:09:16.912 --> 01:09:20.908
no sting Hulk anymore!

01:09:21.908 --> 01:09:24.495
Never again, I promise.

01:09:30.917 --> 01:09:32.703
Hello, Betty.

01:09:32.803 --> 01:09:35.296
Hello, Hulk.

01:09:39.343 --> 01:09:40.928
Are you ready?

01:09:58.946 --> 01:10:00.948
It's not over.

01:10:02.282 --> 01:10:04.402
It might take a while,

01:10:04.502 --> 01:10:06.946
but Ultron's systems
are designed to repair.

01:10:07.046 --> 01:10:08.698
As long as there's
enough of him,

01:10:08.798 --> 01:10:11.534
he can always
come back.

01:10:11.634 --> 01:10:14.912
Then we have to take him
somewhere he can't come back!

01:10:15.012 --> 01:10:16.130
Torunn!

01:10:21.677 --> 01:10:23.921
What are you doing?

01:10:24.021 --> 01:10:25.723
Making sure my family is safe.

01:10:29.977 --> 01:10:31.729
Torunn!

01:11:12.019 --> 01:11:15.681
Rest, my child.

01:11:15.781 --> 01:11:19.026
Thee have earned it.

01:11:21.695 --> 01:11:23.489
Father?

01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:28.986
You have done me proud, Torunn.

01:11:29.086 --> 01:11:31.947
In facing your mortality,

01:11:32.047 --> 01:11:36.160
you learned the very same lesson
that Odin strove to teach me.

01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:40.706
You learned what it meant
to be human.

01:11:40.806 --> 01:11:43.959
That is why I left you
with the Avengers.

01:11:44.059 --> 01:11:47.004
Because in all the gods
of Asgard,

01:11:47.104 --> 01:11:51.050
none have the humanity
that make a true hero.

01:11:51.150 --> 01:11:54.094
Come home, Torunn.

01:11:54.194 --> 01:11:57.064
Come home to Asgard.

01:12:03.862 --> 01:12:05.948
Home.

01:12:07.157 --> 01:12:09.318
Oh, Father,

01:12:09.418 --> 01:12:12.404
I can't believe
I'm saying this.

01:12:12.504 --> 01:12:17.159
My home is
with my family on Earth.

01:12:17.259 --> 01:12:20.746
I know, my daughter.

01:12:20.846 --> 01:12:24.917
But know that the doors
to Asgard are always open to you,

01:12:25.017 --> 01:12:29.471
and when the time comes,
you will be welcomed.

01:12:44.027 --> 01:12:45.028
Huh?

01:12:48.991 --> 01:12:50.993
Dad says hi.

01:12:57.916 --> 01:12:59.785
Solar power cells recharged.

01:12:59.885 --> 01:13:03.664
As I was saying, the Savage Land
is quite lovely. I...

01:13:03.764 --> 01:13:07.301
Oh my.
Have I missed something?

01:13:12.973 --> 01:13:17.261
Man, it's been a long day.

01:13:17.361 --> 01:13:19.722
It's not over, short stuff.

01:13:19.822 --> 01:13:23.984
There's about 10,000 robots in Ultra City
that need arrows in their heads.

01:13:25.485 --> 01:13:29.231
So, are you up
for a little avenging?

01:13:29.331 --> 01:13:31.992
Avengers, assemble!
