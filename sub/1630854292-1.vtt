WEBVTT

01:56.181 --> 01:57.191
Doing good.

02:02.330 --> 02:03.362
Yeah.

02:04.530 --> 02:05.991
Keep going. Yeah.

02:07.335 --> 02:08.532
Just on the left.

02:10.866 --> 02:12.767
Left foot where your knee is.

02:21.382 --> 02:24.647
Ugh... Agh... Huh!

02:27.487 --> 02:28.618
Fuck!

02:28.653 --> 02:30.554
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

02:31.755 --> 02:34.151
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

02:34.186 --> 02:35.658
Slipped on the hold.

02:39.631 --> 02:41.334
Cogs beat the shit out
of me, man.

02:41.369 --> 02:44.502
Almost had it.
Yeah.

02:45.703 --> 02:47.197
Nice one.

02:47.232 --> 02:48.902
Ah, you made it look easy.

02:50.070 --> 02:51.641
There's not a hundred people
in this country

02:51.676 --> 02:53.577
that could have made
that move, man.

02:53.612 --> 02:56.316
You're climbing two grades
better than last time.

02:56.351 --> 02:57.383
Yeah.

02:59.387 --> 03:02.487
Did I tell you I got
a few sponsors looking at me?

03:02.522 --> 03:03.719
Yeah?
Yeah.

03:03.754 --> 03:06.117
To climb
out in Chamonix, man.

03:06.152 --> 03:09.054
If I can make
enough noise this summer,
they should bite.

03:09.089 --> 03:10.495
Nice one, man.

03:10.530 --> 03:12.332
Got a couple of interviews
lined up.

03:12.367 --> 03:14.334
Planning on posting
some big routes.

03:14.369 --> 03:16.226
Yeah? Like what?

03:16.261 --> 03:17.337
Like what?

03:17.372 --> 03:19.097
Like Matterhorn,

03:19.132 --> 03:20.439
Eiger

03:20.474 --> 03:22.034
and the south face
of Mont Blanc.

03:22.069 --> 03:24.102
Ah, the big three.

03:24.137 --> 03:26.236
It's quite an ask.
Yep.

03:26.271 --> 03:28.480
Which is why I need
my climbing partner.

03:28.515 --> 03:31.747
Ah, I can't, man.
Even if I wanted to.

03:31.782 --> 03:34.178
The internship
starts on Monday.
You know that.

03:34.213 --> 03:36.587
Oh, yeah. Insurance, right?

03:36.622 --> 03:38.523
It's just temporary.

03:38.558 --> 03:40.525
It's gonna be temporary
for the next 50 years, man,

03:40.560 --> 03:41.724
if you're not careful.

03:41.759 --> 03:43.726
Come on. Term's over.

03:43.761 --> 03:46.091
This is our last
real summer holiday.

03:46.126 --> 03:47.532
Ever.

03:47.567 --> 03:49.435
You can worry about next year
next year.

03:50.196 --> 03:51.701
What do you say?

03:51.736 --> 03:53.571
Suit and tie...

03:53.606 --> 03:55.738
or ice ax and crampons?

04:03.814 --> 04:07.321
Twenty-two years on this planet,
you still can't tie a tie.

04:08.852 --> 04:11.050
Label's sticking out.
Smarten up.

04:11.085 --> 04:13.756
You've got
a real opportunity here.

04:15.089 --> 04:16.220
Fit in.

04:16.255 --> 04:17.529
Keep up.

04:20.259 --> 04:21.368
Ah, David.

04:21.403 --> 04:23.128
This is my son, Michael.

04:23.163 --> 04:24.294
All right, son,
how you doing?

04:24.329 --> 04:26.703
Give him the tour,
would you?

04:29.037 --> 04:30.267
See that?

04:30.302 --> 04:31.774
Six grands' worth
of kettle.

04:31.809 --> 04:33.237
Shoes, another bag.

04:33.272 --> 04:34.810
Whistle,
three large.

04:34.845 --> 04:37.142
See the Porsche outside?
That's mine, innit.

04:37.177 --> 04:39.485
I'm walking round this place
with a hundred grand
wrapped round me.

04:39.520 --> 04:41.982
You know how I got it?
On the fucking phones.

04:43.084 --> 04:44.182
This is you.

04:47.429 --> 04:49.957
Now, pick up the phone
and dream big.

04:52.533 --> 04:54.632
Carol, where's that latte?

05:03.302 --> 05:04.972
I'd love to have
a minute of your time.

05:06.514 --> 05:08.173
Hello.

05:10.716 --> 05:12.848
How we doing, boy?
What we got?

05:12.883 --> 05:15.180
That should have been done
about- 00.
Yeah, but it's my first day.

05:15.215 --> 05:16.786
Don't really care, buddy.
I know.

05:16.821 --> 05:18.854
Don't really care.
Fake it till you make it.

05:18.889 --> 05:20.922
<i>Any other clich√© you want, mate.</i>

05:22.387 --> 05:24.090
<i>Hey, Mikey, Mikey!</i>

05:24.125 --> 05:26.796
<i>Just want you to see</i>
<i>what you're missing out here.</i>

05:26.831 --> 05:29.634
<i>Look at that!</i>
<i>Yee-hoo-hoo!</i>

05:33.805 --> 05:34.837
Mm?

05:42.715 --> 05:43.582
All right.

05:55.354 --> 05:56.694
<i>High pressure moving in.</i>

05:56.729 --> 05:58.993
<i>One mountain, one week.</i>

05:59.028 --> 06:02.194
<i>You'll be back</i>
<i>in front of your computer</i>
<i>before you're even missed.</i>

07:00.892 --> 07:04.157
I do appreciate
you didn't break into
your own house.

07:05.127 --> 07:06.896
Yeah, right, mate. Yeah, yeah.

08:35.184 --> 08:37.822
Aaah, Mikey! There he is!

08:37.857 --> 08:39.791
A postcard?

08:39.826 --> 08:42.519
Ah, man, what, you traveled
back in time to get this?

08:43.764 --> 08:46.897
1984. I knew
it would get your attention.

08:46.932 --> 08:48.734
A text
would have been fine.

08:48.769 --> 08:50.230
You ignore
my texts, man.

08:50.265 --> 08:52.870
All right, guys,
a couple of quick intros.

08:52.905 --> 08:56.401
Michael, say hi to Natascha.
Natascha, say hi to Michael.

08:56.436 --> 08:58.073
Hey.
American?

08:58.779 --> 08:59.844
Canadian.
Yep.

09:03.014 --> 09:04.882
But don't get any ideas.

09:04.917 --> 09:07.115
'Cause this is Leo,
her boyfriend.

09:07.150 --> 09:08.655
He's a climbing guide.

09:08.690 --> 09:12.087
Alps, Andes,
wherever you wanna die, man.

09:12.122 --> 09:14.727
'Sup?
Not Canadian.

09:14.762 --> 09:18.863
California.
Make a lot more money here
than back home in the Sierra.

09:18.898 --> 09:20.766
Well, Mr. Moneybags...

09:21.670 --> 09:24.099
And this is Rudi.
He's a snowboarder.

09:24.134 --> 09:25.771
He should turn pro
any day now, yeah?

09:25.806 --> 09:28.939
Yeah, and then I can kiss
my day job goodbye.

09:31.944 --> 09:34.010
I need money, bro.
Gimme your watch, hmm?

09:39.215 --> 09:40.313
Ah.
Uh-huh.

09:40.348 --> 09:41.754
A review on Tripadvisor

09:41.789 --> 09:43.723
called me "a fucking prick".

09:43.758 --> 09:45.153
A review we can all trust.

09:45.188 --> 09:46.924
Ha, fuck you!

09:46.959 --> 09:48.728
It was my proudest moment.
So what?

09:49.258 --> 09:50.730
Yeah.

09:50.765 --> 09:52.930
All right, brother,
how long have I got you?

09:52.965 --> 09:55.460
Five days.
It's the best I could do, man.

09:55.495 --> 09:57.462
Any longer
and I'm out of a job.

09:57.497 --> 09:59.068
All right, finish up,
girls and boys.

09:59.103 --> 10:00.971
Let's go climbing.
'Bout time.

10:01.006 --> 10:02.368
Let's go!

10:02.403 --> 10:04.777
Wait. What, what, what, now?
Yeah.

10:04.812 --> 10:07.307
Man, I've just driven 500 miles.
I've hardly slept.

10:07.342 --> 10:08.638
What are you, like, 40?

10:08.673 --> 10:10.915
We need to get you
acclimatized, man!

10:10.950 --> 10:13.577
Come on.
This is it, Mikey!

10:14.382 --> 10:15.953
Grab your kit, man.

10:15.988 --> 10:18.087
We take the telecabin
in 20 minutes, all right?

10:18.122 --> 10:19.957
Uh...
Ha ha!

10:19.992 --> 10:22.091
You're in Chamonix, baby!

10:22.126 --> 10:24.357
Climbed anything of note
out here, Michael?

10:24.392 --> 10:26.128
It's my first time in the Alps.

10:26.163 --> 10:29.296
Fledgling, huh?
Guess you must like babysitting.

10:29.331 --> 10:31.397
Ah, Michael
can handle himself.

10:31.432 --> 10:33.839
He put up a new route
on the Orion Face.

10:33.874 --> 10:35.940
Orion Face?
Never heard of it.

10:35.975 --> 10:37.172
It's on Ben Nevis.

10:38.175 --> 10:40.780
I did Scotland once.
Never again.

10:40.815 --> 10:42.848
Who the hell climbs
in weather like that?

10:42.883 --> 10:45.917
Yeah, well,
any fool can climb
when the sun's out.

10:45.952 --> 10:47.182
We'll see.

10:52.486 --> 10:53.793
I can feel the altitude.

10:53.828 --> 10:55.619
I mean, come on.

10:55.654 --> 10:58.732
You just ascended
a third of Mount Everest
in 20 minutes.

10:58.767 --> 11:01.999
Push through, man.
Couple of days,
you won't even notice it.

11:08.733 --> 11:11.338
Ah,<i> au revoir,</i>
motherfuckers!

11:11.373 --> 11:12.636
Yee-hoo!
Be safe.

11:12.671 --> 11:14.374
<i>Au revoir.</i>
<i>Tres bien.</i>

11:19.183 --> 11:20.952
Hey! Isa.

11:26.685 --> 11:30.027
Hey, Michael,
this is Isabelle.
She's one of us.

11:30.062 --> 11:31.523
Not much of a climber, though.

11:31.558 --> 11:33.195
And you're not much of a skier.

11:33.230 --> 11:34.966
Ooh.

11:38.532 --> 11:39.729
First day?

11:39.764 --> 11:41.236
Yeah.

11:41.271 --> 11:42.501
I can see that.

11:44.175 --> 11:45.944
He's used to climbing molehills
in Scotland.

11:45.979 --> 11:47.638
And Wales.

11:47.673 --> 11:49.640
And Wales.
Yeah, he's just finding out

11:49.675 --> 11:52.049
what thin air tastes like,
that's all.

11:56.451 --> 11:59.320
We're gonna see
how the Englishman copes
at altitude.

12:00.752 --> 12:03.687
All righty.
Well, good luck and be safe.

12:03.722 --> 12:05.260
You too.
Thanks.

12:33.422 --> 12:36.390
Hey, this is slow, Michael.
Even for you. Come on.

12:37.459 --> 12:40.130
I haven't acclimatized yet.
Gimme a break.

12:53.013 --> 12:55.574
Don't get used to
these baby rocks, Michael.

12:55.609 --> 12:57.543
You won't find them
on the Matterhorn.

12:57.578 --> 12:59.281
Shit.
Well, I'd better go home then.

12:59.316 --> 13:01.811
Too late, baby!
I got you now.

13:01.846 --> 13:03.747
Whoo-hoo!

13:03.782 --> 13:06.860
Hey, honey,
JP's climbing faster than you.

13:07.819 --> 13:11.227
If he tries to pass you,
push him off.

13:11.262 --> 13:12.965
I'll say it was an accident.

13:28.048 --> 13:29.212
All right, let's go.

13:30.182 --> 13:31.775
Hey, Michael,

13:31.810 --> 13:33.381
look beneath your feet, man!

13:33.988 --> 13:35.680
Yee-hoo-hoo!

13:36.518 --> 13:38.155
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

13:39.686 --> 13:41.620
Yeah!

13:41.655 --> 13:43.963
That's a keeper, my friend.

13:44.966 --> 13:46.823
You don't wanna wait
for JP and Michael?

13:47.859 --> 13:49.298
I need a beer.

13:49.333 --> 13:51.498
There's no bar up here
last I checked.

13:52.270 --> 13:54.435
They'll catch up.
Okay.

13:54.470 --> 13:56.866
Well, age before beauty.

13:56.901 --> 13:58.637
Mwah.

14:14.358 --> 14:17.392
Come on, Mikey.
Last few steps. Almost there.

14:20.001 --> 14:21.099
Heh heh, yeah!

14:23.103 --> 14:24.102
Yeah.

14:24.863 --> 14:26.830
Whoo-hoo!

14:26.865 --> 14:32.506
Welcome to the asylum
above 4,000 meters!

14:32.541 --> 14:33.947
You nutter, huh?

14:34.708 --> 14:35.916
Worth bleeding for?

14:37.447 --> 14:39.546
That's the altitude, man.

14:39.581 --> 14:40.844
Worth bleeding for.

14:40.879 --> 14:42.681
Yeah.

14:42.716 --> 14:44.749
This is only
the beginning, mate.

14:50.955 --> 14:53.032
Come on. We're gonna miss
the last lift.

14:53.067 --> 14:54.792
Ah, we'll make it!

14:54.827 --> 14:56.200
Yeah, you might.

14:56.235 --> 14:57.861
He looks fried.

14:57.896 --> 14:59.929
Well, I made it
to the top, didn't I?

14:59.964 --> 15:02.503
Yeah, and it
beat the crap out of you
in the process.

15:02.538 --> 15:04.274
The Dent's a training climb.

15:04.309 --> 15:07.508
There's no skills required,
just big fat ropes.

15:07.543 --> 15:10.379
Did you shit yourself while you
were up there, Michael?
You need a fresh diaper?

15:10.414 --> 15:13.580
No, I already went.
I'll save you one
for the Matterhorn.

15:13.615 --> 15:17.056
I love a good
dick-measuring contest.
I'll just get mine out.

15:17.091 --> 15:18.948
Ugh, please don't.

15:18.983 --> 15:21.687
And you can put yours back in
your pants for now, Leo, okay?

15:21.722 --> 15:22.963
Okay, okay.

15:24.857 --> 15:26.923
Hey, don't worry
about him.

15:26.958 --> 15:30.861
The locals take a while
to warm up. That's all.

15:30.896 --> 15:32.731
He's about as local as I am.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.469
Well, he's not French.

15:34.504 --> 15:36.240
But this is Chamonix.

15:36.275 --> 15:39.144
The only way to be one
is to put in the time.

15:39.179 --> 15:40.211
He's earned it.

15:48.683 --> 15:50.947
Oh, right.
Thank you, Laura.

16:01.630 --> 16:02.662
Mmm.

16:14.940 --> 16:16.247
Ah, man.

16:16.282 --> 16:17.875
Who was that?

16:17.910 --> 16:20.515
Mm. A client.

16:20.550 --> 16:23.947
Like, just because
I laugh at
one of his jokes,

16:23.982 --> 16:26.015
he thinks
it's a come on.

16:26.050 --> 16:28.127
I would.
I know you would,

16:28.162 --> 16:29.194
you little pig.

16:29.229 --> 16:31.493
Oh, ho ho! Okay.

16:31.528 --> 16:33.231
<i>Salut,</i> Michael.
<i>Salut.</i>

16:38.700 --> 16:39.534
<i>Merci.</i>

16:40.372 --> 16:42.207
<i>Sant√©.</i>
<i>Sant√©. Sant√©.</i>

16:49.381 --> 16:51.084
So, what are we doing tomorrow?

16:51.119 --> 16:52.580
I'm working tomorrow.

16:52.615 --> 16:54.813
Leo's guiding. Uh... Oh.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.221
What about you, Isa?

16:56.784 --> 16:58.014
What?

16:58.049 --> 17:00.258
I'm doing nothing. Why?

17:01.261 --> 17:03.459
Why don't you take
Michael skiing, hmm?

17:03.494 --> 17:05.824
He should get
into the glacier
every chance he gets.

17:05.859 --> 17:08.332
I need him acclimatized
for the Matterhorn.

17:08.367 --> 17:12.369
Do you ski well?
Well, you're not gonna have to
babysit me or anything.

17:12.404 --> 17:14.536
I won't. Keep up.

17:16.672 --> 17:18.936
Ooh...

18:15.269 --> 18:16.301
Okay.

18:22.100 --> 18:23.605
Okay, yes.

18:39.524 --> 18:41.425
Hello.

18:41.460 --> 18:42.954
Mm.
Is that a Super 8?

18:42.989 --> 18:43.988
Yeah.

18:44.023 --> 18:45.858
Late '70s model.

18:45.893 --> 18:47.893
I just love the images.

18:47.928 --> 18:49.499
Soft and imperfect.

18:50.370 --> 18:52.337
There is no romance
with digital.

18:53.039 --> 18:55.208
You want to have a try?
Sure.

18:55.843 --> 18:57.474
You just have to squeeze
the trigger there

18:57.509 --> 18:59.069
and you're rolling.
Okay.

19:01.777 --> 19:03.139
Hello!

19:03.174 --> 19:04.712
Me?
Yes, you.

19:05.319 --> 19:06.516
I'm camera shy.

19:06.551 --> 19:07.781
I don't know what to do.

19:07.816 --> 19:09.046
Oh, are you now?

19:10.522 --> 19:11.818
I am.

19:11.853 --> 19:14.260
Mm.

19:16.528 --> 19:18.759
So, what's the deal
with you and Jean Pierre?

19:19.960 --> 19:21.333
Are you like, uh...

19:22.930 --> 19:25.799
Like?
You know, dating or...

19:28.034 --> 19:30.804
Well, we're good friends.

19:30.839 --> 19:33.136
He's like a brother
to me now, you know.

19:35.415 --> 19:37.206
What do you mean now?

19:37.241 --> 19:39.208
You have so many questions!

19:39.243 --> 19:40.550
I-- Uh--

19:40.585 --> 19:43.146
Well, yeah,
we've been dating.

19:43.885 --> 19:45.951
Like two or three years ago.

19:45.986 --> 19:48.954
And, actually,
he was my first love.

19:48.989 --> 19:50.230
Right.

19:51.024 --> 19:52.056
Why?

19:52.091 --> 19:53.563
Are you jealous, Michael?

19:55.028 --> 19:56.269
Course not.

19:58.262 --> 19:59.338
Liar.

20:42.812 --> 20:44.108
Jesus.

20:46.585 --> 20:50.114
Poor bastards.
Come August,

20:50.149 --> 20:52.622
they'll be dying
almost every day out here.

21:22.456 --> 21:23.785
Nice one.

21:25.217 --> 21:27.085
Yeah, man.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.461
The face is pretty loose.

21:30.629 --> 21:32.893
Yeah. It will settle.

21:32.928 --> 21:34.862
Plenty of good ice
further up the route.

21:41.640 --> 21:44.476
He's fast!

21:45.677 --> 21:47.105
Definitely better than us.

21:47.140 --> 21:49.272
Yeah, he's in
a different league.

21:55.852 --> 21:57.115
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

22:00.384 --> 22:03.352
Man, that's Damien Roux.
The guy's a movie star here.

22:03.387 --> 22:04.661
Yeah, he's pretty insane.

22:04.696 --> 22:06.498
Oh, man, look at that!

22:06.533 --> 22:08.566
That's climbing.
All right.

22:10.064 --> 22:11.261
I'll take the next pitch.

22:11.296 --> 22:12.900
You sure?
Yeah!

22:12.935 --> 22:14.803
All right.
But don't hang about.

22:14.838 --> 22:17.674
I wanna be on the summit
long before sunset, okay?

22:31.624 --> 22:32.557
Agh!

23:00.246 --> 23:02.279
Yeah, we made it, man!

23:02.314 --> 23:05.018
Yep.

23:08.419 --> 23:10.188
Whoo! Well done.

23:18.264 --> 23:20.506
Whoo-hoo!

23:20.541 --> 23:21.573
Yes!

23:28.813 --> 23:31.077
Lucy would love this.

23:31.112 --> 23:32.650
Your sister could have led that

23:32.685 --> 23:34.751
with one hand
tied behind her back, man.

23:34.786 --> 23:36.115
Yeah.

23:37.723 --> 23:40.119
This should have been
her mountain.

23:40.154 --> 23:42.451
Why do you think
I sent the postcard, eh?

23:43.421 --> 23:44.530
Oh, okay.

23:49.603 --> 23:51.504
I'm gutted she never
made it out here.

23:52.166 --> 23:53.836
But you did.

23:53.871 --> 23:55.475
That counts for something.

23:56.973 --> 23:58.005
Yeah.

23:58.942 --> 23:59.974
Yep.

24:02.583 --> 24:03.978
You want a picture?

24:04.618 --> 24:06.046
No.

24:06.081 --> 24:07.487
This is enough.

24:08.589 --> 24:09.588
Hell yeah.

24:21.426 --> 24:24.163
Leo reckons
the weather's breaking
for the Eiger.

24:24.198 --> 24:27.001
There's gonna be
a window in the next
couple of days, man.

24:27.036 --> 24:28.904
Don't start.
You just climbed

24:28.939 --> 24:30.367
the north face
of the Matterhorn.

24:30.402 --> 24:32.138
You can do this.

24:34.010 --> 24:35.174
I'm so tempted.

24:35.209 --> 24:37.242
Stay one more day
at least.

24:37.277 --> 24:39.717
You know, we're heading
to the Valley Noir
in Italy tomorrow.

24:39.752 --> 24:42.016
Yeah.
It's kind of
a tradition we have

24:42.051 --> 24:43.688
to mark
the summer solstice.

24:43.723 --> 24:45.591
I know. You've said.

24:45.626 --> 24:47.824
And it's the last chance
to ski the glacier.

24:47.859 --> 24:49.595
I've skied the glacier.

24:49.630 --> 24:51.696
Not like this, my friend.
Not like this.

24:53.458 --> 24:57.493
Look, I'd love to,
but I've gotta go.

25:03.501 --> 25:04.742
I can't miss that ferry.

25:05.503 --> 25:06.546
Yeah.

25:08.308 --> 25:09.846
She likes you I think.

25:09.881 --> 25:12.211
Who?
You know who.

25:12.246 --> 25:15.115
We went skiing, Jean Pierre,
that's all.

25:15.150 --> 25:17.381
Chamonix gossips, my friend.
We went skiing!

25:17.416 --> 25:19.350
Chamonix gossips!
We went skiing!

25:25.160 --> 25:27.193
Ooh, it's baking
down here now.

25:27.228 --> 25:29.701
Yeah.
Must be 80/85.

25:29.736 --> 25:31.901
Gotta stop talking
in Fahrenheit.
No one understands!

25:31.936 --> 25:33.804
Yes, please, sir.

25:33.839 --> 25:35.003
And feet.

25:35.038 --> 25:36.400
Why do you
use feet, bro?

25:36.435 --> 25:37.709
Yep.
I don't get it.

25:37.744 --> 25:39.238
Meters and Celsius,
honey.

25:39.273 --> 25:41.042
Okay, it's fucking hot, man.
Better.

25:41.077 --> 25:42.615
But it's still cool up high.

25:42.650 --> 25:44.650
That's what matters.
<i>Oui.</i>

25:44.685 --> 25:45.684
Yo!

25:46.610 --> 25:49.622
Hey, Mikey! There he is!

25:49.657 --> 25:50.887
You good?
<i> Ca va?</i>

25:50.922 --> 25:51.789
Aha!

25:53.892 --> 25:55.089
What about your job?

25:55.124 --> 25:56.255
Ah, I'll get fired.

25:56.895 --> 25:58.191
What about your father?

25:58.226 --> 26:00.556
Well, he told me
to follow my dreams.

26:00.591 --> 26:02.294
Whoa, he actually said that?

26:02.329 --> 26:04.230
No, he called me
a cunt and hung up.

26:04.265 --> 26:08.498
Ah. . Well, life's
not over yet my friend.

26:08.533 --> 26:10.599
You're surfing. Hm?

26:10.634 --> 26:11.743
Yo!

26:13.813 --> 26:15.142
You coming up?

26:15.177 --> 26:16.748
Ah, no,
I didn't bring any skis.

26:16.783 --> 26:18.013
I just came to say hi.

26:18.048 --> 26:19.443
No way, man.

26:19.478 --> 26:21.445
You can't miss this ride.

26:22.756 --> 26:24.954
You brought a spare pair?

26:24.989 --> 26:27.418
Thanks, man.
You haven't seen
what we're skiing yet.

26:27.453 --> 26:28.925
Exactly!

26:28.960 --> 26:30.795
I'm ready. Whoo!
<i>On y va.</i>

26:36.627 --> 26:38.429
<i>A ce soir.</i>

26:38.464 --> 26:40.167
Whoo-hoo!

26:44.877 --> 26:46.206
Michael!

26:47.143 --> 26:49.011
<i>Ca va?</i>

26:52.445 --> 26:53.477
Whoo!

26:56.581 --> 26:58.790
Whoo-hoo!

27:03.027 --> 27:04.356
Whoo-hoo!

27:10.804 --> 27:12.067
Come on, Michael!

27:12.102 --> 27:13.101
Oh, shit!

27:15.336 --> 27:16.599
Shit!

27:18.405 --> 27:19.877
Oh, shit!

27:31.517 --> 27:33.154
Oh, fuck.

28:01.382 --> 28:02.414
Michael!

28:04.715 --> 28:07.859
You made a left
through the ice tunnel?

28:07.894 --> 28:10.224
Isabelle told me.
That's fucking nuts, man!

28:10.259 --> 28:12.358
Yeah, it was
a wrong turn.
No, no, no.

28:12.393 --> 28:16.032
It's only a wrong turn if you
don't make it out, right?

28:17.035 --> 28:18.661
Did you hear about this?

28:18.696 --> 28:20.905
He was skiing like he was
Roger Moore or some shit.

28:20.940 --> 28:24.007
Heard he went full-on
<i>View to a Kill</i> up there.

28:24.042 --> 28:27.340
Almost like
he's one of our own.
Aw, Leo.

28:27.375 --> 28:29.848
Anybody who climbs
the north face of
the Matterhorn in one day

28:29.883 --> 28:31.476
gets my vote.

28:31.511 --> 28:34.050
Well, it was
pretty messy, okay?

28:34.085 --> 28:35.447
It can be messy.

28:35.482 --> 28:37.482
It's a big fucking tick, man.

28:38.749 --> 28:40.188
And that's all you're getting.

28:41.290 --> 28:43.554
I'll take it.

28:46.361 --> 28:48.559
I bet that was hard
for him.

28:48.594 --> 28:52.167
Well, he sees a lot
of fresh faces come up
to Chamonix, Michael.

28:52.202 --> 28:53.630
All gear and no idea.

28:54.765 --> 28:56.006
You can't
just expect him

28:56.041 --> 28:57.843
to welcome you in
with open arms.

28:57.878 --> 28:59.306
Yeah.
Gotta earn that.

29:00.947 --> 29:02.606
I think you just did.

29:02.641 --> 29:04.212
Really?
Mm-hmm.

29:04.247 --> 29:05.708
Yeah.

29:05.743 --> 29:08.381
Oh, we all love you,
Michael.

29:08.416 --> 29:12.517
But I don't think
I'm the girl you should be
talking to right now.

29:14.257 --> 29:15.795
Go get 'em, tiger.

29:24.399 --> 29:25.464
Hello.

29:26.731 --> 29:29.765
You look, uh,
you look good tonight.

29:30.669 --> 29:32.042
Only tonight?

29:32.077 --> 29:34.110
N-- Not just tonight.

29:34.145 --> 29:37.245
I'm sorry, I've, uh,
I've had a few beers.

29:37.280 --> 29:40.215
Wow, you really know
how to make a girl feel special.

29:40.250 --> 29:41.810
No, come on.
That's not what I meant.

29:41.845 --> 29:44.285
You know what I meant.
So what did you mean?

29:44.320 --> 29:46.991
Well, I said it before,
that you look--

29:47.961 --> 29:49.961
you look beautiful.

29:49.996 --> 29:53.591
You got anything else
than I'm beautiful?

29:54.858 --> 29:56.231
It's a bit lousy.
Okay.

29:56.266 --> 29:57.628
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

29:57.663 --> 30:00.268
Uh... Mm...

30:00.303 --> 30:02.666
It was really special
skiing with you today.

30:04.208 --> 30:06.472
And what was so special
about skiing with me?

30:08.047 --> 30:09.211
The chase.

30:11.919 --> 30:14.579
And what do you plan to do
if you got me?

30:16.517 --> 30:17.549
Hmm?

30:25.691 --> 30:28.791
So, why did you come back?

30:28.826 --> 30:34.599
Well, 'cause I wanted to climb
and help JP realize his dream.

30:34.634 --> 30:36.876
Mm. That's the only reason
you stayed?

30:37.769 --> 30:39.241
Well, it's not the only reason.

30:40.541 --> 30:42.013
So?

30:42.048 --> 30:43.674
Are you really gonna
make me say it?

30:43.709 --> 30:45.643
Yeah.

30:45.678 --> 30:47.381
Because I wanted to see you.

30:49.715 --> 30:52.419
And I thought that maybe...

31:22.286 --> 31:23.351
Mm...

31:25.058 --> 31:27.091
Mm...

31:29.425 --> 31:30.655
Good morning.

31:31.955 --> 31:33.658
Did you sleep well?

31:33.693 --> 31:35.693
Mmm...

31:35.728 --> 31:37.266
Mmm...

31:40.469 --> 31:43.371
I'm going for a swim.

31:45.804 --> 31:47.573
Isn't it a bit cold?

31:47.608 --> 31:48.772
No.

31:52.514 --> 31:53.744
Ooh la la!

32:01.589 --> 32:02.456
It's good!

32:02.491 --> 32:03.391
Yeah?

32:47.305 --> 32:49.404
Hey...
Hey!

32:53.542 --> 32:57.247
So we're
holding hands now?

32:57.282 --> 32:59.546
Ah. You can let go
anytime.

33:05.983 --> 33:08.016
Then put it through the till
like any other bar beer.

33:08.051 --> 33:10.623
That's pretty much it.
Got it.

33:10.658 --> 33:13.164
It's a boring job
but pays enough to get
up to the glacier.

33:13.199 --> 33:15.023
That's all that
really matters, right?

33:15.058 --> 33:16.761
Yep.

33:22.340 --> 33:25.902
There he is!
With a whole new career.

33:27.345 --> 33:29.378
How did it go,
lover boy?

33:29.413 --> 33:31.908
All right,
you don't have to
say a word.

33:31.943 --> 33:33.580
How's working with B√©a?

33:33.615 --> 33:35.978
Yeah, she's cool.
Yeah, she's cool, man.

33:36.013 --> 33:38.156
She's playing the same game
as the rest of us.

33:38.191 --> 33:40.686
Just waiting to become
the next big thing.

33:41.425 --> 33:43.018
How good is she?

33:43.053 --> 33:46.296
Man, she was hot
for a little while.

33:46.331 --> 33:48.397
Then her sponsor
got a crush on someone new.

33:48.432 --> 33:50.267
Someone crazier.

33:50.302 --> 33:53.336
She's gotta up her game though.
Bust some big-ass routes.

33:54.867 --> 33:56.669
Just like you,
right?

33:56.704 --> 33:58.242
Ah, Mikey, Mikey.

33:58.277 --> 34:00.508
You know, if you stay
in your comfort zone,

34:00.543 --> 34:03.775
you'll stay here
behind this shitty bar
for the rest of your life.

34:03.810 --> 34:06.118
Come on.
You know,
this life-and-death business

34:06.153 --> 34:07.944
is very fickle.

34:09.882 --> 34:12.388
It's Damien Roux.
Hey, turn this up, would you?

34:18.858 --> 34:20.022
Yeah, Damien!

34:55.158 --> 34:56.597
Yeah, my man!

34:56.632 --> 34:57.796
Yes.

35:38.278 --> 35:40.135
Harder ground's
not stopping him.

35:40.170 --> 35:42.104
He'll need to slow down
on the crux pitch.

35:42.139 --> 35:43.479
There's no shortcuts.

36:13.236 --> 36:14.774
Holy crap!

36:14.809 --> 36:15.841
This guy is nuts.

36:15.876 --> 36:17.249
Wait, lemme see.

36:17.284 --> 36:19.174
Wait.
Lemme see!

36:40.472 --> 36:41.900
Damien, you legend!

37:09.501 --> 37:11.270
Turn the music off!

37:12.262 --> 37:13.965
Turn the music off now!

37:15.265 --> 37:18.233
Turn the goddamn
fucking music off!

37:18.268 --> 37:20.279
Don't make me
come up there, asshole!

37:28.586 --> 37:30.619
<i> Hero amongst</i>
<i>the climbing fraternity,</i>

37:30.654 --> 37:32.181
<i>veteran of the Alps,</i>

37:32.216 --> 37:33.886
<i>Damien Roux has been killed</i>

37:33.921 --> 37:35.756
<i>attempting a new speed record</i>

37:35.791 --> 37:38.363
<i>on the route Divine Providence</i>
<i>on Mont Blanc.</i>

37:38.398 --> 37:41.091
<i>He is the latest victim</i>
<i>in a string of accidents</i>

37:41.126 --> 37:43.929
<i>to take place in the Alps</i>
<i>this summer.</i>

37:43.964 --> 37:46.899
One moment he was just
picking it to shreds,

37:46.934 --> 37:48.835
unlocking all these moves
and then...

37:49.838 --> 37:51.233
I feel sick.

37:51.268 --> 37:53.235
I feel
a lot of things.

37:53.270 --> 37:54.907
Surprise
ain't one of them.

37:55.778 --> 37:58.416
Dance music, a fucking DJ?

37:58.451 --> 38:00.550
It wasn't climbing,
it was a freak show

38:00.585 --> 38:04.851
set up by his sponsors demanding
bigger, bolder, scarier routes.

38:04.886 --> 38:06.655
That's what
we all came to see, Leo.

38:06.690 --> 38:08.492
They pushed him too hard, man.

38:08.527 --> 38:11.462
You saw those slick moves
and the flashy touches.

38:11.497 --> 38:13.090
That's showboating.
No.

38:13.125 --> 38:15.796
Damien is a legend.
One of a kind.

38:15.831 --> 38:19.096
Yeah, you keep telling
a man that, he'll start
to believe you.

38:19.131 --> 38:21.934
Vanity is a deadly thing
to bring into these mountains.

38:43.287 --> 38:44.528
Come in!

38:45.828 --> 38:47.564
Hello, hello!
Hey!

38:49.392 --> 38:52.470
Cold snap's kicked out
a good dusting of snow
on the Bernese Oberland.

38:52.505 --> 38:55.033
Folks round Interlaken reckon
the Eiger's gonna play ball.

38:55.068 --> 38:56.870
Yeah? She's in condition?

38:56.905 --> 38:58.872
About as good as
you're gonna get right now.

38:58.907 --> 39:01.644
If you want it perfect,
wait till November.

39:01.679 --> 39:02.711
Let's do this!

39:04.044 --> 39:04.911
Michael?

39:06.145 --> 39:08.046
We took 16 hours
on the Matterhorn.

39:08.081 --> 39:11.181
We could have done it in ten.
The Eiger's twice the size.

39:11.216 --> 39:14.052
You heard what he just said.
We might not get another chance.

39:14.087 --> 39:17.561
That's a risk that could end
in disappointment,
not-- not death, JP.

39:20.423 --> 39:22.060
This is not about the Eiger.

39:22.095 --> 39:24.194
It's about Damien Roux.

39:24.229 --> 39:26.196
You know why he's dead, Michael?

39:27.067 --> 39:28.297
'Cause free solo climbers

39:28.332 --> 39:29.903
don't live
to a ripe old age.

39:29.938 --> 39:32.840
That's just
a cold, hard fact of life.

39:32.875 --> 39:34.710
No ropes,
no partner.

39:35.581 --> 39:37.042
Just a matter of time.

39:38.178 --> 39:42.487
Me? I'd like to get
back to some good,
old-fashioned mountaineering.

39:42.522 --> 39:44.720
Put yesterday behind us.
Thank you.

39:46.625 --> 39:47.690
Yo.

39:49.727 --> 39:51.694
That's what separates
him and us.

39:53.027 --> 39:55.423
And I'll be at the end
of that rope,

39:55.458 --> 39:57.359
babysitting you as always.

39:57.394 --> 39:59.196
And just remember, Michael,

39:59.231 --> 40:01.737
yes or no is the right answer.

40:01.772 --> 40:04.201
I won't climb with you
on a maybe.

40:04.236 --> 40:06.940
You make your decision,
we'll back you either way.

40:17.788 --> 40:19.084
Hey, Michael.

40:21.253 --> 40:22.692
Hello.
Hey.

40:22.727 --> 40:24.419
It's not so bad here.

40:24.454 --> 40:26.256
No, best hotel
in Chamonix.

40:26.291 --> 40:29.633
And how is your room service?

40:31.065 --> 40:32.328
You're looking at it.

40:32.935 --> 40:34.506
Mm, cup of tea?

40:34.541 --> 40:36.838
No, no, no,
I don't drink tea.

40:38.138 --> 40:40.138
I'm not one of
your English girls, Michael.

40:40.173 --> 40:41.304
Okay.

40:43.275 --> 40:45.341
Mm. In the backpack.

40:47.477 --> 40:51.149
The real gourmet stuff.

40:51.184 --> 40:54.152
But I see something interesting.

40:55.188 --> 40:57.826
Mm-hmm-hmm.
Let's have a look.

41:00.160 --> 41:01.698
<i>Oh, putain.</i>

41:01.733 --> 41:04.327
That's a strong look.

41:04.362 --> 41:06.901
I was young.

41:07.937 --> 41:09.970
Oh, who's this?

41:10.005 --> 41:11.972
She's very pretty.

41:12.975 --> 41:14.304
Should I be jealous?

41:15.648 --> 41:17.681
That's Lucy, my sister.

41:18.178 --> 41:19.210
Mmm.

41:22.116 --> 41:24.215
You do look a bit alike.

41:24.250 --> 41:26.349
Same big, bright eyes.

41:31.697 --> 41:33.158
Did I say something wrong?

41:36.669 --> 41:38.801
Uh, nothing.

41:41.564 --> 41:42.937
She's not with us anymore.

41:44.941 --> 41:47.271
Okay. I'm so sorry.

41:47.306 --> 41:49.944
If you want, we can
talk about something else.

41:49.979 --> 41:51.143
It's okay.

41:51.915 --> 41:53.343
Uh, I don't mind.

41:53.378 --> 41:55.048
Are you sure?

41:55.083 --> 41:58.150
Usually, uh, I can't stand
talking about her.

41:58.185 --> 42:00.251
I can barely even think
about her without...

42:04.829 --> 42:07.929
But out here, it's strange.

42:09.933 --> 42:11.867
It's like she's with us.

42:11.902 --> 42:14.298
I know it sounds silly.
No, it's not.

42:14.333 --> 42:16.531
So, she was a climber too?
Yeah.

42:17.270 --> 42:18.467
A good one.

42:23.606 --> 42:25.078
When my mum died,

42:25.883 --> 42:27.344
my dad...

42:27.379 --> 42:29.577
kinda went off
the deep end.

42:29.612 --> 42:33.592
He was pretty horrible
to be around.

42:34.859 --> 42:36.056
Still is.

42:37.026 --> 42:39.521
Her solution was
to take us climbing.

42:39.556 --> 42:41.325
So, she got you hooked.

42:41.360 --> 42:42.700
She did.

42:43.736 --> 42:45.065
When you climb,

42:46.233 --> 42:47.397
it's like...

42:48.598 --> 42:50.367
nothing else exits.

42:51.942 --> 42:55.878
You know, there's no room
for bullshit, grief, pain.

42:55.913 --> 42:57.506
Only the present.

42:57.541 --> 42:58.914
The next move.

43:00.643 --> 43:02.885
And what happened to her?

43:05.450 --> 43:08.891
We were on a climb in Scotland,
and the weather turned.

43:08.926 --> 43:10.794
Total whiteout.

43:10.829 --> 43:12.664
It-- It was-- It was scary.

43:13.299 --> 43:15.458
When we got back
to the car park,

43:15.493 --> 43:19.968
we were so buzzed
that we'd made it back
that we had a couple of beers.

43:20.003 --> 43:21.167
Just a couple.

43:22.170 --> 43:23.532
Take the edge off, you know.

43:24.777 --> 43:26.777
She was in such a rush
to get home.

43:27.505 --> 43:28.977
She wanted to drive.

43:29.815 --> 43:33.575
I just had this... feeling.

43:33.610 --> 43:36.149
Like something bad
was gonna happen.

43:40.958 --> 43:42.452
And I did nothing.

44:22.901 --> 44:25.132
Michael, get down!

44:29.534 --> 44:30.874
Ah, fuck!

44:41.348 --> 44:42.446
Fuck.

44:47.519 --> 44:49.618
Michael! You all right?

44:49.653 --> 44:51.356
Yeah.

45:08.276 --> 45:10.012
Hey, hey, get in!

45:31.068 --> 45:33.266
Whoa.

45:33.301 --> 45:35.235
The face is falling
to fucking bits.

45:35.270 --> 45:38.733
The sun is warming up the face,
melting the ice.

45:38.768 --> 45:41.109
All that compacted rock's
come loose.

45:41.144 --> 45:44.343
We need to stop climbing now.
Bivvy at the Swallow's Nest.

45:45.577 --> 45:47.412
See how it is tomorrow.

45:57.556 --> 46:00.392
Oh, my God.
All right now, you got this.

46:00.427 --> 46:01.492
Just get to me.

46:03.001 --> 46:04.396
All right, honey,
I'm right here.

46:04.431 --> 46:06.134
I'm right here.

46:06.169 --> 46:07.729
Okay.
Quick as you can.

46:09.106 --> 46:11.106
Hey!

46:11.141 --> 46:12.910
Hey, honey...

46:14.144 --> 46:16.276
All  right, get to me.

46:18.313 --> 46:20.775
I got you!
Right, recover!

46:24.781 --> 46:27.353
Gimme some slack!

46:29.852 --> 46:30.994
Come on.
Okay.

46:31.029 --> 46:32.061
All right.

46:36.628 --> 46:37.935
Oh, my God!
That was close.

46:37.970 --> 46:39.266
I'm sorry for freaking out.

46:39.835 --> 46:41.873
No, no, it's crazy.
It's still coming.

47:00.157 --> 47:01.860
<i>JP, Michael, come in.</i>

47:02.489 --> 47:04.027
Yep, Leo.

47:04.062 --> 47:06.458
How are you two doing?
<i>We're at Death Bivvy,</i>

47:06.493 --> 47:08.493
about to turn in
for the night. You?

47:08.528 --> 47:10.363
We're at Swallow's Nest.

47:10.398 --> 47:12.629
Could've gotten further,
but there's a lot of rockfall,

47:12.664 --> 47:14.697
and we don't need to push it
right now.

47:14.732 --> 47:16.534
Yeah, it gets worse higher up.

47:16.569 --> 47:18.602
It's too warm,
there's not enough ice.

47:18.637 --> 47:20.307
<i>It's choppy as fuck.</i>

47:20.342 --> 47:22.606
Yeah, but should be fine
if we get moving early enough.

47:22.641 --> 47:25.279
It's your call, Leo.
What are you thinking?

47:25.314 --> 47:28.612
<i>I mean, Natascha and I</i>
<i>are above all the problems now.</i>

47:28.647 --> 47:31.813
We should be able to summit
pretty easily tomorrow.

47:31.848 --> 47:34.156
You guys still got all that
bad shit in front of ya.

47:34.191 --> 47:37.753
Do you suggest a retreat?
Over.

47:37.788 --> 47:40.723
Come on, man,
he isn't saying that.
What the fuck?

47:40.758 --> 47:44.001
If you wanna go for the summit,
you gotta keep your foot down.

47:44.036 --> 47:46.729
Hit the face
before the sun comes up.

47:46.764 --> 47:49.666
Exactly what we're
planning to do, Leo.

47:51.208 --> 47:54.077
What are you doing?
It's a fucking blitzkrieg
on the ice fields.

47:54.112 --> 47:56.310
Get them off the damn thing.

47:56.345 --> 47:59.984
Hey, guys, you're still
close enough to Railway Tunnel.

48:00.019 --> 48:01.678
You might wanna consider
a retreat

48:01.713 --> 48:03.647
<i>while you're still</i>
<i>in a position to do so.</i>

48:09.886 --> 48:11.226
Fine, yes, we will.

48:11.855 --> 48:13.096
Stay safe.

48:13.998 --> 48:17.067
<i> Always.</i>
<i>We'll meet you in</i>
<i>Kleine Scheidegg tomorrow night</i>

48:17.102 --> 48:19.102
<i>for a beer</i>
<i>no matter what you decide.</i>

48:20.039 --> 48:22.270
Sure thing,
sure thing. Out.

48:25.275 --> 48:26.703
It's gotta be their choice.

48:28.971 --> 48:30.806
Do you think
they'll turn back?

48:31.644 --> 48:32.775
Did we?

48:48.760 --> 48:51.002
A lot colder than yesterday.
Yeah.

48:52.236 --> 48:53.961
Face looks pretty good.
Yeah.

48:53.996 --> 48:57.008
So, up or down?

49:01.179 --> 49:02.904
I don't know, man.

49:02.939 --> 49:04.477
Ah...

49:04.512 --> 49:06.479
Couple hours and we
could be having breakfast

49:06.514 --> 49:08.316
with the best view
in Switzerland.

49:08.351 --> 49:10.483
Eggs, bacon, coffee.

49:10.518 --> 49:15.125
Come on, man.
I didn't come this far
to eat eggs and fucking bacon!

49:15.160 --> 49:17.985
Now, come on,
at least let's try
a couple more pitches.

49:18.020 --> 49:19.855
See how it plays out.

49:20.792 --> 49:21.791
So...

49:22.365 --> 49:23.826
up or down?

49:28.371 --> 49:29.931
More like it.

49:39.514 --> 49:41.448
It looks loose.

49:42.550 --> 49:43.813
Not so bad.

49:44.783 --> 49:45.848
Small steps.

49:58.302 --> 50:00.401
All right. Come on.
Come across, man.

50:10.314 --> 50:12.248
Michael! Watch out!

50:16.155 --> 50:17.979
Oh, fuck!

50:18.014 --> 50:19.486
Michael! Get over here!

50:19.521 --> 50:21.224
Hurry the fuck up, man!

50:24.922 --> 50:25.921
Hurry up!

50:27.859 --> 50:30.068
Michael!
Come on, man!

50:31.434 --> 50:33.401
Come on, come on, come on!

50:33.436 --> 50:36.470
Forget the fucking ice screw
and get over here! Hurry!

50:42.412 --> 50:44.775
Michael! Get down!

51:12.739 --> 51:14.772
Michael!

51:24.322 --> 51:25.453
No!

51:29.052 --> 51:30.755
Michael!

51:30.790 --> 51:31.921
Michael!

51:33.155 --> 51:34.231
Michael.

51:35.399 --> 51:37.168
Michael!

51:41.306 --> 51:43.867
Can you reach the face?

51:46.102 --> 51:48.641
I can't get it, man!

51:48.676 --> 51:51.974
Ah, fuck.

51:52.009 --> 51:53.844
Try your ice axes!

52:04.153 --> 52:05.691
I can't reach!

52:06.331 --> 52:08.298
Ah, fuck!

52:08.993 --> 52:10.696
<i>Putain! Merde!</i>

52:10.731 --> 52:12.599
All right! Hold on!

52:12.634 --> 52:14.667
I'll rig a hoist!

52:23.975 --> 52:25.678
<i>Vite, vite, vite, vite, vite.</i>

52:25.713 --> 52:27.108
<i>Allez, vite, vite, vite.</i>

52:51.167 --> 52:52.342
I can't get it!

53:43.219 --> 53:44.493
I got you, brother!

54:00.940 --> 54:02.313
Fuck.

54:04.581 --> 54:06.284
I'm calling mountain rescue.

54:44.489 --> 54:46.181
I'm all right. I'm not too bad.

54:49.659 --> 54:50.691
I'm okay.

54:51.661 --> 54:52.825
Yeah, I'm okay, I'm okay.

55:30.700 --> 55:35.164
<i> Natascha, Leo,</i>
<i>lost to the Eiger.</i>

55:35.199 --> 55:36.803
We're all grieving.

55:38.235 --> 55:41.170
The respect you commanded
was indisputable.

55:42.140 --> 55:44.041
As was the love.

55:48.487 --> 55:52.379
We can all go crazy
trying to figure out
what happened up there.

55:52.414 --> 55:53.754
Was it a slip?

55:53.789 --> 55:55.525
Was it a rockfall?

55:55.560 --> 55:57.461
Did their gear fail?

55:57.496 --> 55:59.892
The truth is, we'll never know.

56:00.862 --> 56:02.565
But what we know

56:02.600 --> 56:05.898
is that you guys
were together at the end.

56:05.933 --> 56:07.504
Whoo!
We love you!

56:07.539 --> 56:09.396
And we're fucking thankful
for that.

56:09.431 --> 56:11.871
Yeah. Yeah!

56:11.906 --> 56:14.676
And now, we raise our glasses,

56:14.711 --> 56:19.714
Yeah!
and we drink the biggest
fucking toast we can!

56:19.749 --> 56:21.584
To you guys!

56:21.619 --> 56:22.684
Leo!

56:22.719 --> 56:23.751
Natascha!

56:23.786 --> 56:25.918
We fucking love you!

56:28.725 --> 56:30.417
We fucking love you!

56:30.452 --> 56:33.662
Can you reach the top?
Can you reach the top?

56:37.426 --> 56:39.734
We fucking love you!

56:45.401 --> 56:46.708
We love you, guys!

56:53.310 --> 56:55.442
I just don't understand.

56:55.477 --> 56:58.852
They're all laughing
and drinking
as if nothing happened.

56:58.887 --> 57:00.249
It just doesn't feel right.

57:06.125 --> 57:07.729
Wakey, wakey!

57:07.764 --> 57:08.994
Ah!

57:10.261 --> 57:11.359
You ready?

57:13.605 --> 57:15.099
For what?

57:15.805 --> 57:17.002
Climbing. Come on.

57:18.434 --> 57:20.907
Are you serious?

57:20.942 --> 57:23.272
Two of your best friends have
just been put in the ground.

57:23.307 --> 57:24.944
This is how we honor them.

57:26.585 --> 57:28.618
Come on. Grab your harness,
get your gear.

57:31.117 --> 57:32.347
Five minutes.

58:13.225 --> 58:14.455
Hey, what's going on?

58:14.490 --> 58:16.325
Low-Lower me down, man.

58:17.900 --> 58:19.768
Why?
Lower me down!

58:23.169 --> 58:24.938
What the fuck happened up there?

58:28.570 --> 58:31.043
Look, I'm not in the mood
for honoring anyone today.

58:33.212 --> 58:34.717
Hey, what's the matter?

58:34.752 --> 58:35.982
What's the matter?

58:36.017 --> 58:38.182
This place is insane.

58:38.217 --> 58:40.382
People are dropping like flies.

58:40.417 --> 58:43.594
Yeah, well, next summer,
it will be the same, man.

58:43.629 --> 58:46.553
Leo and Natascha may have died,
but they died
doing what they loved,

58:46.588 --> 58:48.863
doing what they lived for.
Doing what they loved?

58:48.898 --> 58:50.733
Are you serious?

58:50.768 --> 58:53.395
They died screaming,
Jean Pierre.

58:53.430 --> 58:55.166
Don't you get it?

58:55.201 --> 58:57.971
That's why
we come back out here.

58:58.006 --> 59:01.172
When we climb,
they're right here with us.

59:01.207 --> 59:03.647
They're alive again.
Don't you feel it?

59:05.475 --> 59:08.377
Come on, you--
you can't quit now.

59:08.412 --> 59:10.313
Not when we're this close.

59:10.348 --> 59:11.688
The Eiger said no.

59:11.723 --> 59:14.251
Fine, we have to respect that.

59:15.551 --> 59:17.661
So we move on
to the White Mountain.

59:21.557 --> 59:22.666
I'm afraid.

59:22.701 --> 59:24.327
I know you're afraid.

59:25.429 --> 59:27.462
I'm afraid too.

59:27.497 --> 59:31.136
But everything we ever wanted
is on the other side of fear.

59:34.438 --> 59:36.680
I'm doing this
with or without you,
Michael.

59:36.715 --> 59:38.473
So make a decision.

59:38.508 --> 59:42.147
I'm not sharing my headstone
with some mountain, JP.

59:43.513 --> 59:44.919
I can't do it.

1:00:03.170 --> 1:00:04.400
<i>Ca va?</i>
<i> Comment allez-vous?</i>

1:00:06.008 --> 1:00:07.535
Mm-hmm.

1:00:14.511 --> 1:00:16.819
Jean Pierre told me
that you're out now.

1:00:16.854 --> 1:00:19.921
Yeah, it's over.
Done.

1:00:24.125 --> 1:00:29.161
I was thinking that maybe...
we could take your car.

1:00:29.196 --> 1:00:30.998
Just get away from here.

1:00:31.033 --> 1:00:33.770
Be our chance to be alone
and be ourselves.

1:00:33.805 --> 1:00:34.837
<i>Merci.</i>

1:00:35.807 --> 1:00:37.598
Nine days,

1:00:37.633 --> 1:00:40.337
that's all we have left,
and I have to leave, you know.

1:00:41.010 --> 1:00:42.108
I hate that.

1:00:43.408 --> 1:00:44.847
We get together,

1:00:44.882 --> 1:00:47.476
then life
gets in the way.

1:00:47.511 --> 1:00:50.248
It doesn't have to.
Yeah, but it always does.

1:00:50.283 --> 1:00:51.678
Doesn't it?

1:00:51.713 --> 1:00:53.581
Come Christmas,

1:00:53.616 --> 1:00:55.825
we would have gone
our separate ways

1:00:55.860 --> 1:00:58.795
and you won't even know
what the fuck I look like.

1:01:00.359 --> 1:01:02.392
This self-pitying drunk act,

1:01:03.593 --> 1:01:05.098
it's boring.

1:01:05.133 --> 1:01:07.265
Yeah.
Yeah, it doesn't suit you.

1:01:08.301 --> 1:01:09.498
That's not who you are.

1:01:09.533 --> 1:01:11.203
That's not who I am?
Mm-mmm.

1:01:11.238 --> 1:01:13.502
I've known you
for seven fucking days.

1:01:13.537 --> 1:01:15.306
You don't--
You don't know who I am.

1:01:15.341 --> 1:01:18.045
I don't even know
who I fucking am, okay?

1:01:18.080 --> 1:01:19.112
Enjoy.

1:01:20.082 --> 1:01:21.279
See ya later.

1:01:30.686 --> 1:01:32.829
Hey! Hey!

1:01:41.037 --> 1:01:45.072
<i>One of the stars of the future,</i>

1:02:10.627 --> 1:02:11.967
<i>We're all bleeding, you know.</i>

1:02:12.002 --> 1:02:13.562

<i>Watch this space.</i>

1:02:32.121 --> 1:02:34.121

1:02:52.174 --> 1:02:53.701
Whoo!

1:03:17.463 --> 1:03:19.496
I just wanted to say
that I...

1:03:20.466 --> 1:03:21.498
What?

1:03:23.370 --> 1:03:25.007
I probably deserved that.

1:03:25.042 --> 1:03:28.439
And I can hit a lot harder.
You got off lightly.

1:03:30.014 --> 1:03:31.607
Did I?
Mm-hmm.

1:03:34.282 --> 1:03:35.710
Because I like you.

1:03:39.155 --> 1:03:40.781
You like me?

1:03:40.816 --> 1:03:43.751
Not right now.

1:03:43.786 --> 1:03:48.492
You're insensitive,
you're a drunk. Dumb<i> connard.</i>

1:03:48.527 --> 1:03:50.362
That's all you are.

1:03:50.397 --> 1:03:52.529
<i>Canard?</i>
Yeah,<i> connard.</i>

1:03:52.564 --> 1:03:54.300
I'm a--
I mean--

1:03:55.468 --> 1:03:56.698
I'm a duck?

1:03:57.833 --> 1:03:59.976
No. Asshole.

1:04:02.079 --> 1:04:03.144
Yeah.

1:04:04.081 --> 1:04:05.377
I already knew that.

1:04:06.347 --> 1:04:07.379
Okay.

1:04:24.530 --> 1:04:25.562
Get in.

1:04:28.105 --> 1:04:30.039
Oh, you smell so bad!

1:04:30.074 --> 1:04:33.504
I can't... Oh,<i> putain!</i> Oh, no.

1:04:33.539 --> 1:04:36.375
Mmm!

1:04:36.410 --> 1:04:39.345
You smell like a vat of wine.
It's disgusting.
Yeah?

1:04:39.380 --> 1:04:40.841
Yeah.
Yeah.

1:04:40.876 --> 1:04:42.249
Go brush your teeth. Oh!

1:04:42.284 --> 1:04:45.153
Go brush your teeth.

1:04:45.188 --> 1:04:47.221
Please, go.
Okay.

1:04:56.496 --> 1:05:00.971
You thought a bit more about
what we were saying?

1:05:03.008 --> 1:05:08.176
You know, you and me
getting off a few days.

1:05:10.081 --> 1:05:12.114
I did, yeah.

1:05:15.086 --> 1:05:16.151
And?

1:05:21.653 --> 1:05:23.455
I need to go and see JP.

1:05:26.592 --> 1:05:27.723
About what?

1:05:29.925 --> 1:05:31.463
Mont Blanc.

1:05:32.664 --> 1:05:34.730
But you said you were finished.

1:05:38.505 --> 1:05:41.143
I'm his climbing partner,
Isabelle. What do you want?

1:05:43.279 --> 1:05:45.972
Well, from what I heard,
you've been replaced.

1:05:46.007 --> 1:05:47.875
With B√©a and Rudi?
Mmm.

1:05:48.845 --> 1:05:50.317
They're not good enough.

1:05:51.320 --> 1:05:53.122
He's not thinking straight.

1:06:01.198 --> 1:06:02.725
I don't know, just...

1:06:04.696 --> 1:06:06.498
Maybe you could...

1:06:08.172 --> 1:06:11.701
just talk him out of it,
you know?

1:06:12.473 --> 1:06:13.505
For me?

1:06:16.609 --> 1:06:17.872
He won't listen.

1:06:19.480 --> 1:06:20.512
You know that.

1:06:21.812 --> 1:06:24.450
He's climbing
that white mountain
no matter what.

1:06:27.015 --> 1:06:29.059
That's his choice.

1:06:33.560 --> 1:06:36.858
You know he's obsessional
and unbending.

1:06:41.865 --> 1:06:44.074
I can't believe I'm so stupid.

1:06:49.444 --> 1:06:50.806
Once again...

1:06:53.580 --> 1:06:56.218
none of us stood a chance
against this place.

1:07:01.192 --> 1:07:02.884
I owe him.

1:07:02.919 --> 1:07:04.061
For what?

1:07:06.758 --> 1:07:09.132
He was there for me
when I needed him most.

1:07:10.091 --> 1:07:12.025
Okay? He-- He--

1:07:12.060 --> 1:07:14.368
he took me climbing,
he kept me busy,

1:07:14.403 --> 1:07:16.106
he kept me sane.

1:07:17.703 --> 1:07:20.506
And now
he's going to get you killed.

1:07:24.446 --> 1:07:27.084
Lucy died
because I did nothing.

1:07:30.650 --> 1:07:34.322
I'm not gonna let that happen
to my best friend, too. No.

1:07:44.268 --> 1:07:45.399
Let's push.

1:07:46.435 --> 1:07:47.566
Come on.

1:07:49.405 --> 1:07:52.208
Yep, come on. I don't have
all day, man. Come on.

1:07:56.577 --> 1:07:57.939
He's not so bad.

1:08:01.076 --> 1:08:02.944
Yeah, well,
it's only a 6c man.

1:08:02.979 --> 1:08:06.288
Should be running up that thing!
Hey, Rudi, you're shit.

1:08:10.954 --> 1:08:12.228
Come on, right foot.

1:08:14.529 --> 1:08:16.133
I want back in.

1:08:17.928 --> 1:08:19.961
Now you change your mind.

1:08:19.996 --> 1:08:21.996
Yeah, only because
I know you won't.

1:08:22.031 --> 1:08:24.339
JP said you froze up
climbing Maladiere.

1:08:25.474 --> 1:08:27.243
Yeah, well, I wasn't feeling it.

1:08:27.278 --> 1:08:29.905
You want us to put our lives
on the line for how you feel?

1:08:29.940 --> 1:08:30.972
No.

1:08:31.678 --> 1:08:32.908
Just him.

1:08:34.483 --> 1:08:36.681
You wanna tie in? Hmm?

1:08:40.588 --> 1:08:42.621
Not bad. Not bad.

1:08:50.994 --> 1:08:52.631
He's fast.

1:08:52.666 --> 1:08:54.930
Hardly the south face
of Mont Blanc, is it?

1:08:59.310 --> 1:09:01.343
He's really fucking fast.

1:09:11.553 --> 1:09:14.015
You may come in useful
after all.

1:09:14.050 --> 1:09:16.116
Let's go and knock
this bastard off.

1:09:47.721 --> 1:09:49.853
Looking good! Moving fast! Hey.
Yeah.

1:09:49.888 --> 1:09:51.624
Feeling good, man.

1:09:51.659 --> 1:09:52.889
Oh.

1:09:56.026 --> 1:09:57.366
Oh!

1:09:58.402 --> 1:09:59.434
What the fuck?
Oh!

1:10:00.932 --> 1:10:03.999
Guys! We've got a pair
of jokers above us.

1:10:04.034 --> 1:10:06.166
What the fuck are these idiots
playing at?

1:10:06.201 --> 1:10:10.280
They've been
kicking rocks down on us
the whole fucking time, huh?

1:10:10.315 --> 1:10:11.974
You shouldn't be here, assholes!

1:10:17.751 --> 1:10:19.454
<i> Merci, putain!</i>

1:10:46.417 --> 1:10:47.845
<i>Ahi. Ahi.</i>

1:10:51.422 --> 1:10:52.685
Okay.<i> Uno.</i>

1:11:03.797 --> 1:11:04.928
<i>Tre! Ah!</i>

1:11:06.162 --> 1:11:08.261
Tino!

1:11:13.378 --> 1:11:15.169
<i>Attenzione!</i>

1:11:18.108 --> 1:11:19.415
Look out!

1:11:21.386 --> 1:11:23.276
B√©a!

1:11:23.311 --> 1:11:24.783
B√©a!

1:12:00.557 --> 1:12:02.788
B√©a! Stay calm, B√©a, okay?

1:12:02.823 --> 1:12:03.855
Stay calm!

1:12:05.529 --> 1:12:07.958
B√©a! B√©a!

1:12:10.226 --> 1:12:12.127
Gimme some slack!
Yeah!

1:12:12.162 --> 1:12:14.899
JP!
Yeah, I'm here!
I'm here, I'm here.

1:12:14.934 --> 1:12:16.835
I'm with you, I'm with you.

1:12:16.870 --> 1:12:18.133
Give me rope.

1:12:22.040 --> 1:12:24.337
Okay, coming! Coming!

1:12:24.372 --> 1:12:26.042
It's okay, it's okay.
I'm with you.

1:12:26.077 --> 1:12:27.780
I'm coming!

1:12:31.522 --> 1:12:34.149
I'm coming.
I'm coming, baby.

1:12:34.184 --> 1:12:35.623
Breathe in,
breathe out.

1:12:37.121 --> 1:12:38.923
Show me. Wha--

1:12:41.257 --> 1:12:42.388
Look at me.
Look at me.
Okay.

1:12:42.423 --> 1:12:44.192
Don't look. Don't look.

1:12:44.227 --> 1:12:45.600
Don't look, okay?
Can you move it?

1:12:47.571 --> 1:12:50.605
I got you. B√©a, I got you.

1:12:53.907 --> 1:12:57.513
Here, take these.
B√©a, take these.
Ibuprofen?

1:12:57.548 --> 1:12:59.911
It's not much, but it should
take the edge off, okay?

1:13:07.954 --> 1:13:10.526
Okay, hey. Easy, easy.

1:13:10.561 --> 1:13:13.023
We're gonna call
the rescue and we're
gonna have dinner tonight.

1:13:13.058 --> 1:13:15.256
Okay? Easy. Don't worry.

1:13:40.316 --> 1:13:42.448
The storm
has changed course.
Yeah?

1:13:42.483 --> 1:13:44.252
It's gonna be here
within the hour.

1:13:44.287 --> 1:13:46.056
Coming in
from the west.
Shit.

1:13:46.091 --> 1:13:47.222
Means we won't see it
till it hits.

1:13:47.257 --> 1:13:48.454
Did you call
Mountain Rescue?

1:13:48.489 --> 1:13:50.126
They're sending a party on foot

1:13:50.161 --> 1:13:52.799
but they have to come up
from Courmayeur.
Fuck.

1:13:52.834 --> 1:13:54.361
They won't get here
until tomorrow.

1:13:54.396 --> 1:13:56.033
Well, then we retreat.

1:13:56.068 --> 1:13:57.639
We dig in at the Eccles
shelter and we wait.

1:13:57.674 --> 1:13:59.432
No, we cannot
turn back, man.

1:13:59.467 --> 1:14:00.807
That's exactly what
we're gonna do, Jean Pierre.

1:14:00.842 --> 1:14:02.303
Climb's over.
Michael,

1:14:02.338 --> 1:14:03.909
right below us
is the Fr√™ney Glacier,

1:14:03.944 --> 1:14:05.878
worst avalanche black spot
on the whole massif.

1:14:05.913 --> 1:14:08.078
Yeah.
Half an hour of snow
is all it needs.

1:14:13.690 --> 1:14:15.151
No, we bivvy on the face.

1:14:15.686 --> 1:14:17.791
Wait for the storm to pass.

1:14:22.864 --> 1:14:24.259
That's it.

1:16:07.672 --> 1:16:08.869
Shit!

1:16:09.971 --> 1:16:11.201
What is it?

1:16:11.636 --> 1:16:14.567
The rescue team are holed up
at the Messina heart.

1:16:14.602 --> 1:16:16.206
They can't continue.

1:16:16.241 --> 1:16:17.944
They're gonna
wait out the storm.

1:16:19.541 --> 1:16:21.409
Should pass in a few hours.

1:16:30.255 --> 1:16:32.255
It's another avalanche.
A big one.

1:16:32.290 --> 1:16:34.389
Okay, there is no way down now.

1:16:49.472 --> 1:16:50.647
Isabelle.

1:17:12.033 --> 1:17:15.166
One, two, three.

1:17:17.665 --> 1:17:19.368
One kilometer away!

1:17:20.778 --> 1:17:23.471
I can't--
I can't feel my fingers.

1:17:24.106 --> 1:17:26.045
Give me your hand.
I got you.

1:17:43.064 --> 1:17:44.195
Okay.

1:17:48.399 --> 1:17:50.135
<i>Merde!</i>
<i>Putain!</i>

1:17:52.205 --> 1:17:53.534
That's it.
That's all our fucking water!

1:17:53.569 --> 1:17:55.569
All of it!
All of it gone!

1:17:58.981 --> 1:18:00.508
Shut the fuck up.

1:18:00.543 --> 1:18:03.214
Shut the fuck up!
Shut the fuck up!

1:18:03.249 --> 1:18:05.381
Both of you!
It's gone, okay?

1:18:05.416 --> 1:18:07.889
We're sitting on a giant
lightning conductor,

1:18:07.924 --> 1:18:10.320
we need to get
the hell out of here. Now!

1:18:10.355 --> 1:18:12.157
A rescue team will come.

1:18:12.192 --> 1:18:13.521
In this?

1:18:14.023 --> 1:18:16.623
They're playing cards
in a cozy little hut

1:18:16.658 --> 1:18:18.999
3,000 feet south of here,
and you're stalling.

1:18:19.601 --> 1:18:22.596
If we don't make
a decision now, we die.

1:18:22.631 --> 1:18:25.170
The only way down is up.

1:18:26.668 --> 1:18:29.207
Look, we climb to the top
of the Pillar.

1:18:29.242 --> 1:18:31.374
We follow the ridge
to the summit

1:18:31.409 --> 1:18:33.640
and then we get
to the Vallot Hut
and we dig in.

1:18:33.675 --> 1:18:35.180
Okay?
Come on.

1:18:35.215 --> 1:18:37.545
Two hundred meters
in this storm?

1:18:37.580 --> 1:18:40.548
It's fucking suicide, man!
B√©a has hypothermia!

1:18:40.583 --> 1:18:42.418
We don't have enough time.
You cannot climb!

1:18:42.453 --> 1:18:44.156
Not in this!
No, you can't!

1:18:44.191 --> 1:18:46.554
You can't climb it!
Fuck you! For fuck's sake!

1:18:46.589 --> 1:18:49.095
Listen. Three years ago,
Cairngorms,

1:18:49.130 --> 1:18:51.768
we got caught
in all fucking hell
and I led us out.

1:18:52.437 --> 1:18:55.332
Yeah. Yeah, he's right.
He's right.

1:18:55.367 --> 1:18:56.564
He led us out.

1:18:57.270 --> 1:18:58.907
You have to trust me.

1:18:58.942 --> 1:19:01.404
Rudi, I can do this.

1:20:51.912 --> 1:20:54.022
Huh?

1:20:54.591 --> 1:20:57.487
Rescue party?
Are you the rescue party?

1:20:57.522 --> 1:21:01.095
There is no rescue party!
It's just us.

1:21:02.065 --> 1:21:03.526
What happened?

1:21:03.561 --> 1:21:05.033
Took a fall.

1:21:05.068 --> 1:21:07.167
Broke his leg.
Frost bite.

1:21:07.730 --> 1:21:09.037
What about you?

1:21:09.072 --> 1:21:10.940
One of us has a broken arm.

1:21:10.975 --> 1:21:13.008
You dropped a rock the size
of a house on us.

1:21:13.043 --> 1:21:14.372
The rock.

1:21:15.243 --> 1:21:17.507
It broke like a rotten branch.

1:21:18.840 --> 1:21:20.180
Can you help us?

1:21:24.384 --> 1:21:26.186
You have a tough rope.

1:21:26.221 --> 1:21:28.683
Michael's gonna pull you,
but you have to climb!

1:21:29.218 --> 1:21:31.059
All right, take it!

1:21:33.195 --> 1:21:34.425
Go B√©a! Go!

1:21:34.460 --> 1:21:35.822
You can do it B√©a! Go!

1:21:51.510 --> 1:21:52.949
Are you in?
Yeah.

1:21:53.908 --> 1:21:55.710
Fucking novices.

1:21:56.312 --> 1:21:58.845
We cannot take
these two with us.
They're dead weight.

1:21:58.880 --> 1:22:01.188
We have to try.
No, we don't.

1:22:01.223 --> 1:22:02.585
They're responsible
for themselves.

1:22:02.620 --> 1:22:04.488
They need our help,
Jean Pierre!

1:22:04.523 --> 1:22:06.292
They're gonna
get us all killed!

1:22:07.130 --> 1:22:08.954
I'm climbing
to the next stance.

1:22:08.989 --> 1:22:11.066
Tino, you're next!

1:22:11.101 --> 1:22:13.035
Okay, I'm gonna pull you up
on the rope.

1:22:13.070 --> 1:22:15.895
Use your arms, your good leg,
whatever will help me!

1:22:15.930 --> 1:22:18.601
I'm gonna get you
up this, all right?
Pitch by pitch.

1:22:28.646 --> 1:22:30.481
Come on. Get up!

1:22:30.516 --> 1:22:32.615
Okay, safe!

1:22:36.291 --> 1:22:38.291
Come on, Tino!

1:22:38.326 --> 1:22:40.887
Take care. Take care!

1:22:40.922 --> 1:22:42.394
Keep going!
Come on!

1:22:43.133 --> 1:22:44.297
Come on, try!

1:22:44.332 --> 1:22:45.991
I'm sorry.
Harder!

1:22:49.568 --> 1:22:51.667
Michael!
It's not gonna work!

1:22:53.440 --> 1:22:54.934
Fuck!

1:23:01.745 --> 1:23:03.976
Tino, you have to do this.

1:23:04.011 --> 1:23:05.318
There's no other way.

1:23:08.224 --> 1:23:11.786
Give us a fucking chance!
Piece of shit!

1:23:13.229 --> 1:23:15.361
I couldn't limp across
the street, my friend.

1:23:16.230 --> 1:23:18.529
How do you propose I can
traverse Monte Bianco?

1:23:19.064 --> 1:23:21.466
My only chance is to wait here
for the rescue party.

1:23:23.569 --> 1:23:26.372
Get out of here while
you still can. Please.

1:23:28.772 --> 1:23:31.113
I stay with him.
Angelo, please.

1:23:31.148 --> 1:23:33.148
Shut up.
Please! You don't need to.

1:23:33.183 --> 1:23:35.117
You've said your piece.
I'm staying.

1:23:35.152 --> 1:23:38.318
You and me, we get lifted off
this rock come the morning.

1:23:41.422 --> 1:23:42.751
Right, boys?

1:23:54.996 --> 1:23:56.270
I got you!

1:24:25.301 --> 1:24:27.367
We did it, Michael.
How's your arm?

1:24:27.402 --> 1:24:29.138
It's frozen below the elbow.

1:24:34.068 --> 1:24:37.344
No! B√©a! B√©a

1:24:37.379 --> 1:24:39.742
B√©a! B√©a!

1:24:39.777 --> 1:24:40.743
Michael!

1:24:41.746 --> 1:24:45.418
Fuck,<i> putain!</i> No!

1:24:47.488 --> 1:24:49.653
Okay, JP! Clip on!

1:24:51.459 --> 1:24:52.557
Go, JP!

1:24:52.592 --> 1:24:53.591
Safe?

1:24:55.265 --> 1:24:56.297
Okay!

1:24:57.597 --> 1:24:59.058
<i> Allez,</i> go!

1:25:17.716 --> 1:25:19.617
All right,
clip in, clip in.

1:25:19.652 --> 1:25:21.718
Okay.<i> C'est bon.</i>
<i>C'est bon.</i>
You're on.

1:25:22.523 --> 1:25:23.786
Fucking hell.

1:26:35.123 --> 1:26:38.333
Come on, guys. Keep pushing!

1:26:55.715 --> 1:26:57.913
Hey, this is
the summit, I think.

1:26:58.685 --> 1:26:59.750
You sure?

1:27:00.419 --> 1:27:02.588
Well, we can't go
no higher, Michael.

1:27:02.623 --> 1:27:05.217
Guys, we need to dig
a shelter right now!

1:27:05.252 --> 1:27:08.495
The Vallot Hut is over there!
A few hundred meters away!

1:27:08.530 --> 1:27:10.189
Come on, we've gotta keep going.

1:27:10.224 --> 1:27:11.399
Come on.

1:27:12.001 --> 1:27:14.864
Okay, your call.
Your fucking call!
Come on.

1:27:27.681 --> 1:27:29.010
<i>Michael.</i>

1:27:31.278 --> 1:27:32.684
<i>Michael.</i>

1:27:35.953 --> 1:27:37.887
<i>Michael.</i>
<i>Michael, help me.</i>

1:29:33.103 --> 1:29:35.169
What the hell
have you just done?

1:29:35.204 --> 1:29:38.073
Fuck you!

1:29:38.108 --> 1:29:40.581
That's his lifeline,
you fucking--
Shut up!

1:29:40.616 --> 1:29:43.309
He's gonna get
us all killed, man!

1:29:43.344 --> 1:29:45.982
Are you nuts?
He's done what he wants.

1:29:53.497 --> 1:29:55.123
Fuck you!

1:29:56.599 --> 1:29:59.435
What the fuck have you done?
Huh? Huh?

1:30:02.462 --> 1:30:04.473
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Mike! Mike!

1:30:16.718 --> 1:30:17.915
You wanna die, man!

1:30:20.447 --> 1:30:21.787
Not with you.

1:30:57.825 --> 1:30:59.088
Jean Pierre?

1:31:01.763 --> 1:31:03.191
Jean Pierre?

1:31:10.574 --> 1:31:12.035
Jean Pierre?

1:31:20.683 --> 1:31:22.144
JP!

1:31:24.049 --> 1:31:27.083
That could be hundreds
of meters deep, man.

1:31:27.855 --> 1:31:29.954
No way he survived this.

1:31:29.989 --> 1:31:30.988
We're gonna find out.

1:31:49.976 --> 1:31:51.206
Jean Pierre?

1:31:51.241 --> 1:31:53.175
Michael.

1:31:54.475 --> 1:31:56.046
I can't move.

1:31:59.249 --> 1:32:00.985
I'm fucked.

1:32:01.020 --> 1:32:02.987
Stay there. Stay there.

1:32:13.329 --> 1:32:15.032
I'm fucking dead, man.

1:32:15.067 --> 1:32:16.462
You're gonna be fine.

1:32:16.497 --> 1:32:17.738
Okay?

1:32:17.773 --> 1:32:19.267
Rudi's gonna pull you up.

1:32:19.902 --> 1:32:21.368
We're gonna get you out.

1:32:21.403 --> 1:32:23.502
Okay Rudi! He's on!

1:32:23.537 --> 1:32:25.372
Okay. Ready?

1:32:25.407 --> 1:32:27.616
Here, ice ax.
Take it, take it.

1:32:29.213 --> 1:32:30.509
Fuck.

1:32:30.544 --> 1:32:33.017
On three. Okay Rudi?

1:32:33.052 --> 1:32:35.547
When I say go,
pull like hell!

1:32:35.582 --> 1:32:38.352
Three, two, one.

1:32:41.588 --> 1:32:43.093
Pull, Rudi!

1:32:43.931 --> 1:32:45.491
Come on, JP.

1:32:48.738 --> 1:32:50.463
Pull, Rudi!

1:32:51.565 --> 1:32:52.674
Good job!

1:33:01.179 --> 1:33:02.508
Rudi!

1:33:08.252 --> 1:33:11.451
I got you, JP!

1:33:25.269 --> 1:33:26.565
Rudi!

1:33:33.475 --> 1:33:35.607
Rudi!

1:33:39.151 --> 1:33:40.447
Rudi?

1:33:47.797 --> 1:33:49.192
Rudi?

1:34:10.050 --> 1:34:11.379
Not like this.

1:34:12.448 --> 1:34:13.546
Not here.

1:34:52.796 --> 1:34:55.830
I should have gone
for eggs and bacon.

1:34:58.931 --> 1:35:03.233
Michael, I need you
to do something for me.

1:35:04.874 --> 1:35:08.172
When you see my parents,
I want you to say that...

1:35:08.207 --> 1:35:10.570
Don't say that,
Jean Pierre.

1:35:11.815 --> 1:35:13.474
We'll get you
off this mountain.

1:35:15.951 --> 1:35:17.709
Tell them I was happy.

1:35:20.923 --> 1:35:24.221
Tell them you-- you did
everything you could.

1:35:24.256 --> 1:35:27.389
No way. All right,
we're gonna rest here
for a few minutes.

1:35:27.424 --> 1:35:30.491
Then we're gonna get our energy
back and I'll get you down.

1:35:30.526 --> 1:35:34.132
I swear.
We're all gonna die here!

1:35:34.167 --> 1:35:37.201
If we die, we die together.

1:35:37.236 --> 1:35:39.137
'Cause I'm not leaving.

1:35:40.006 --> 1:35:43.174
It doesn't...
doesn't hurt anymore.

1:35:45.508 --> 1:35:47.739
Just rest here for a minute.

1:35:54.088 --> 1:35:55.615
Just a couple...

1:36:46.734 --> 1:36:47.876
Lucy?

1:36:49.341 --> 1:36:50.439
I'm here.

1:37:08.162 --> 1:37:09.854
I'm so sorry.

1:37:09.889 --> 1:37:12.692
No. Michael, don't be.

1:37:13.662 --> 1:37:15.266
<i> Michael?</i>

1:37:15.301 --> 1:37:18.038
You have to go. Now.

1:37:18.073 --> 1:37:20.403
No.
<i> Michael?</i>

1:37:20.438 --> 1:37:22.075
I can't go back there.

1:37:22.704 --> 1:37:24.209
I don't wanna go back.

1:37:24.244 --> 1:37:26.343
I wanna stay here.
<i> Michael? Michael!</i>

1:37:26.378 --> 1:37:28.378
I've missed you so much.

1:37:29.810 --> 1:37:32.151
<i> Michael! Michael!</i>

1:37:32.186 --> 1:37:33.922
<i>Michael! Michael!</i>

1:37:33.957 --> 1:37:36.188
Hey. Hey!

1:37:36.223 --> 1:37:39.092
You cannot sleep.
You sleep, you die.

1:37:39.919 --> 1:37:42.161
If we stay here, we die!

1:37:42.196 --> 1:37:43.591
All right? Come on.

1:37:45.034 --> 1:37:47.232
Jean Pierre.
Hey, wake up, man.

1:37:47.267 --> 1:37:48.530
I couldn't wake him.
Huh?

1:37:48.565 --> 1:37:49.894
He's gone.
No, shut up.

1:37:49.929 --> 1:37:51.203
He's gone.
Come on, man!

1:37:51.832 --> 1:37:53.271
Come on!
Michael.

1:37:53.306 --> 1:37:55.339
Wake up!
Michael.

1:37:56.210 --> 1:37:57.572
Michael.
Jean Pierre...

1:37:57.607 --> 1:37:58.837
Michael!

1:37:59.372 --> 1:38:00.806
Michael!
Jean Pierre, wake up, man.

1:38:00.841 --> 1:38:03.710
Michael. Michael!
Wake up. What?

1:38:03.745 --> 1:38:04.909
Michael!
What do you want?

1:38:04.944 --> 1:38:06.251
Listen to me!

1:38:06.286 --> 1:38:07.846
Jean Pierre?
He's gone, man!

1:38:08.453 --> 1:38:09.584
He can't be.

1:38:09.619 --> 1:38:10.684
Look...

1:38:16.626 --> 1:38:17.790
I'm sorry.

1:38:23.831 --> 1:38:25.336
We need to go, man.

1:38:31.245 --> 1:38:33.542
I won't leave you here, okay?

1:38:33.577 --> 1:38:34.840
Okay.

1:38:34.875 --> 1:38:36.083
Okay.

1:39:21.658 --> 1:39:24.164
Michael! Michael!

1:39:24.199 --> 1:39:27.233
I see the hut! Follow me!

1:39:27.268 --> 1:39:28.960
Follow me!

1:39:28.995 --> 1:39:30.335
We can make it.

1:39:36.310 --> 1:39:37.474
Help!

1:39:41.876 --> 1:39:44.019
Help!

1:39:56.594 --> 1:39:57.923
Michael!

1:40:09.541 --> 1:40:11.409
Sarah!
Yeah?

1:40:12.643 --> 1:40:15.644
Michael.
Stay with me. Look at me.

1:40:30.298 --> 1:40:32.199
Michael...

1:42:23.037 --> 1:42:24.179
Hello, you.

1:42:31.716 --> 1:42:32.814
B√©a...

1:42:34.719 --> 1:42:36.048
Jean Pierre...

1:42:38.118 --> 1:42:39.524
I tried to get them down.

1:42:45.565 --> 1:42:47.367
I crossed over, you know.

1:42:51.406 --> 1:42:53.373
If I wanted to die,

1:42:53.875 --> 1:42:56.442
all I had to do was...

1:42:56.477 --> 1:42:57.806
lie down

1:42:58.842 --> 1:43:00.248
and sleep.

1:43:04.353 --> 1:43:06.111
That's when I saw them.

1:43:10.249 --> 1:43:12.084
What did you see?

1:43:14.495 --> 1:43:15.527
Ghosts.

1:43:17.894 --> 1:43:20.400
Waiting for me to fall.

1:43:22.998 --> 1:43:25.735
But there was someone else
up there, you know.

1:43:30.478 --> 1:43:32.071
A presence...

1:43:33.679 --> 1:43:35.943
that was keeping me alive.

1:43:38.585 --> 1:43:40.013
Willing me on.

1:43:45.053 --> 1:43:46.888
In the end...

1:43:48.628 --> 1:43:50.529
there are no ghosts.

1:43:51.961 --> 1:43:53.125
No...

1:43:54.128 --> 1:43:55.798
guardian angels.

1:43:59.375 --> 1:44:00.935
Just you...

1:44:04.270 --> 1:44:07.205
and how much you have
left in you to get home.

1:44:07.944 --> 1:44:09.449
And you did.

1:44:24.125 --> 1:44:26.829
I'm told my son
may never be found.

1:44:28.371 --> 1:44:30.195
That Mont Blanc
is now his grave.

1:44:41.813 --> 1:44:45.144
How was Jean Pierre...
at the end?

1:44:52.527 --> 1:44:54.626
He died doing what he loved.

1:44:56.025 --> 1:44:58.223
Not many of us
have that privilege.

1:44:58.825 --> 1:45:00.368
Is that what you believe?

1:45:06.299 --> 1:45:08.970
I'm not interested
in beautiful fiction,
Michael.

1:45:19.213 --> 1:45:20.652
We were in hell.

1:45:24.988 --> 1:45:28.286
We were making strange
decisions up there.

1:45:28.321 --> 1:45:29.529
Uh...

1:45:33.128 --> 1:45:34.699
Decisions that now,

1:45:35.735 --> 1:45:37.570
sitting opposite you...

1:45:40.003 --> 1:45:42.971
I mean,
they don't make sense.

1:45:51.652 --> 1:45:53.916
He wanted me to tell you
something.

1:45:56.217 --> 1:45:58.085
That he was happy...

1:46:00.089 --> 1:46:01.352
at the end.

1:46:04.731 --> 1:46:06.126
He wasn't crying.

1:46:09.538 --> 1:46:11.131
He wasn't in pain.

1:46:17.711 --> 1:46:20.712
The last thing I saw
on his face was a smile.

1:46:24.245 --> 1:46:25.750
That's the truth.

1:46:52.108 --> 1:46:53.140
So...

1:46:54.748 --> 1:46:55.879
So...

1:46:58.554 --> 1:47:02.083
I guess we just have to
step away from this place.

1:47:03.284 --> 1:47:04.316
Just like that?

1:47:05.924 --> 1:47:06.989
Are we...

1:47:10.126 --> 1:47:12.291
You really wanna
end it like this?

1:47:14.328 --> 1:47:16.097
Do you really think I want to?

1:47:18.002 --> 1:47:19.540
It has to.

1:47:20.175 --> 1:47:22.367
I can't be part of this
any longer.

1:47:22.402 --> 1:47:24.974
I can't watch all
the people I Iove die.

1:47:25.009 --> 1:47:27.746
I won't.
You won't have to, okay?

1:47:27.781 --> 1:47:30.111
Come on. You and me,

1:47:30.146 --> 1:47:33.521
let's go somewhere
completely different
and never come back.

1:47:34.854 --> 1:47:36.282
I would love that.

1:47:36.984 --> 1:47:39.692
But you're always going
to carry that place
in your heart.

1:47:40.992 --> 1:47:43.223
You're going to miss it.
No, I'm done with it.

1:47:43.258 --> 1:47:44.895
All of it.
No.

1:47:44.930 --> 1:47:46.424
I promise.
No.

1:47:46.459 --> 1:47:48.129
You say that now.

1:47:49.638 --> 1:47:53.035
Sooner or later, you'll be
back on the mountain

1:47:53.708 --> 1:47:55.235
and I'll be stuck in a hut

1:47:55.270 --> 1:47:57.512
hoping that you
make it back down.

1:47:58.147 --> 1:47:59.877
That's it.
It won't be like that.

1:48:00.473 --> 1:48:01.505
I know.

1:48:04.180 --> 1:48:06.213
Because I'm not going
to let it happen.

1:48:12.287 --> 1:48:13.726
I fell in love with you,
you know.

1:48:26.235 --> 1:48:30.204
‚ô™<i> Melody day</i>
<i>What have I done?</i> ‚ô™

1:48:31.174 --> 1:48:33.240
That's why I have to go.

1:48:33.275 --> 1:48:38.146
‚ô™<i> Now our hearts</i>
<i>Are locked up tight again</i> ‚ô™

1:48:40.117 --> 1:48:42.051
‚ô™<i> And when I pray</i>
<i>It's all begun</i> ‚ô™

1:48:42.086 --> 1:48:44.317
But we will always have
this place, right?

1:48:55.737 --> 1:48:56.868
Okay.

1:49:08.079 --> 1:49:12.114
‚ô™<i> Melody day</i>
<i>Where have you gone?</i> ‚ô™

1:49:15.053 --> 1:49:20.221
‚ô™<i> All the hope I had</i>
<i>Has gone away</i> ‚ô™

1:49:22.060 --> 1:49:26.634
‚ô™<i> And what we had</i>
<i>Has come undone</i> ‚ô™

1:49:28.803 --> 1:49:34.070
‚ô™<i> And when you smile</i>
<i>It melts away again</i> ‚ô™

1:49:35.106 --> 1:49:41.374
‚ô™<i> Be there</i> ‚ô™

1:49:42.047 --> 1:49:47.754
‚ô™<i> Be there</i> ‚ô™

1:49:48.988 --> 1:49:55.960
‚ô™<i> Be there</i> ‚ô™

1:49:55.995 --> 1:50:01.262
‚ô™<i> Be there</i> ‚ô™

1:50:03.772 --> 1:50:09.501
‚ô™<i> Melody day</i>
<i>What have I done?</i> ‚ô™

1:50:10.670 --> 1:50:15.749
‚ô™<i> Now our hearts</i>
<i>Are locked up tight again</i> ‚ô™

1:50:17.720 --> 1:50:23.317
‚ô™<i> And when I pray</i>
<i>It's all begun</i> ‚ô™

1:50:24.320 --> 1:50:30.797
‚ô™<i> And when you smile</i>
<i>It melts away again</i> ‚ô™

1:50:30.832 --> 1:50:36.627
‚ô™<i> Tell them, oh</i> ‚ô™

1:50:38.334 --> 1:50:42.875
‚ô™<i> Tell them I always knew why</i> ‚ô™

1:50:44.747 --> 1:50:48.342
‚ô™<i> So long</i> ‚ô™
