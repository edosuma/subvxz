WEBVTT

00:07.874 --> 00:11.544
We're getting ready to knock,
so let's get into position.

00:20.453 --> 00:21.554
(laughter inside)

00:21.621 --> 00:23.656
They're definitely
in there.

00:24.624 --> 00:26.359
MAN:
Look, look, look...

00:26.426 --> 00:27.861
(knocks softly)

00:27.927 --> 00:29.996
What are you doing?
It's a knock warrant.

00:30.063 --> 00:31.731
Doesn't say how hard
we have to knock.

00:31.798 --> 00:33.466
Yeah.

00:33.533 --> 00:35.068
(knocks loudly)
Police.

00:35.135 --> 00:36.436
Open up.

00:37.470 --> 00:40.006
I'll be right there.
(muttering)

00:40.073 --> 00:41.074
Just, uh, give me a moment.

00:41.141 --> 00:43.610
(speaks Spanish)

00:48.047 --> 00:49.949
(toilet flushing)

00:51.251 --> 00:52.986
Hit it.
No, no.

00:53.052 --> 00:55.021
Wait.
Hit it. They're flushing
the damn drugs down the toilet.

00:55.088 --> 00:56.322
You don't know that.

00:57.090 --> 00:58.725
(toilet flushing)

01:02.262 --> 01:03.296
If we don't go in
right now,

01:03.363 --> 01:04.330
there's gonna be
nothing left.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.932
It's a knock warrant.

01:05.999 --> 01:07.100
And we knocked.

01:11.137 --> 01:12.672
On the ground.

01:13.440 --> 01:15.308
<i>Ay, dios mío.</i>
Hands.

01:15.375 --> 01:16.843
Son of a bitch.

01:17.677 --> 01:19.946
On the ground. Stand up.
Hands where I can see 'em.

01:20.013 --> 01:21.915
(toilet flushing)
AGENT: Clear.

01:22.949 --> 01:24.317
Clear here.

01:24.384 --> 01:26.719
Can I help you
with something, Officer?

01:31.658 --> 01:34.494
Hey.
Sorry I'm late.

01:34.561 --> 01:35.862
What do we got? A suicide?

01:35.929 --> 01:37.297
DANNY: No, looks like
she was strangled.

01:37.363 --> 01:38.465
And then posed?

01:38.531 --> 01:39.666
Yeah, from the looks of it,

01:39.732 --> 01:41.434
the rosary beads
were placed after

01:41.501 --> 01:42.635
she was already dead.

01:42.702 --> 01:44.637
Any signs of forced entry?
No,

01:44.704 --> 01:46.706
but the killer seems
to have left a note.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.141
"Sufferings of this

01:48.208 --> 01:49.876
"present time are not
worthy to be compared

01:49.943 --> 01:51.211
"with the glory
which shall

01:51.277 --> 01:52.912
be revealed to us."

01:52.979 --> 01:55.415
So, we've got a religious nut
that wants to send a message.

01:55.482 --> 01:59.752
Or just a nut who we need
to send a message to ourselves.

02:03.556 --> 02:05.258
(indistinct chatter)

02:05.325 --> 02:06.259
I know, it's crazy.

02:06.326 --> 02:07.360
Did someone call 911?

02:07.427 --> 02:09.295
Yeah, we did.

02:09.362 --> 02:10.396
Is anyone hurt?

02:10.463 --> 02:11.798
He's in there.

02:19.572 --> 02:21.941
(sighs)

02:27.013 --> 02:28.815
29-David. Be advised

02:28.882 --> 02:31.284
we have a DOA at this location,
appears to be a homicide.

02:31.351 --> 02:33.486
Ma'am, you can't be here.
Send a bus and
a supervisor.

02:34.821 --> 02:38.558
This is a crime scene.
You need to step away.

02:39.692 --> 02:42.028
Do you know
who stabbed him?

02:43.997 --> 02:45.031
Mm-hmm.

02:45.098 --> 02:46.499
Mm-hmm.

02:46.566 --> 02:48.434
It was you.

02:49.769 --> 02:51.838
Yeah, I did it.

02:53.706 --> 02:56.109
I killed him.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.080
You want to tell me
exactly what happened?

03:01.147 --> 03:03.650
I'm not sure
I should talk to you.

03:03.716 --> 03:06.486
You spoke to the officers
at the scene this morning.

03:06.553 --> 03:08.922
I did, but I...
But what?

03:08.988 --> 03:11.758
But one of the cops
pulled me aside

03:11.824 --> 03:13.960
and told me that
if I want to avoid jail,

03:14.027 --> 03:15.728
I shouldn't talk to anyone
without my lawyer.

03:15.795 --> 03:17.430
A cop told you this?

03:17.497 --> 03:18.631
Yes.

03:18.698 --> 03:19.999
Which one?

03:20.066 --> 03:21.167
The nice one.

03:22.368 --> 03:23.703
She said she'd help me.

03:23.770 --> 03:25.471
Does this officer have a name?

03:25.538 --> 03:27.440
(sighs)

03:27.507 --> 03:28.975
Officer Janko.

03:31.945 --> 03:33.212
I told Detective Hill
to stand down

03:33.279 --> 03:34.781
and wait for the occupants
to answer the door.

03:34.847 --> 03:36.115
They were flushing
drugs down the toilet

03:36.182 --> 03:37.884
while we waited outside.
And his cowboy tactics

03:37.951 --> 03:39.819
caused injury to a female inside
the apartment who was on the

03:39.886 --> 03:41.287
other side of the door.
Come on, man, she was faking it.

03:41.354 --> 03:44.824
When she files a civil suit,
are you gonna pay for it?

03:44.891 --> 03:48.361
Could we please just stick
to the facts for now?

03:48.428 --> 03:49.662
GREEN:
Here's the facts.

03:49.729 --> 03:51.631
We have FBI protocols.

03:51.698 --> 03:53.499
Detective Hill can't just
do whatever he wants,

03:53.566 --> 03:56.569
whenever he wants, and the rest
of the team be damned.

03:56.636 --> 03:58.104
Okay, but in terms of the law,

03:58.171 --> 04:00.573
Detective Hill
didn't do anything wrong.

04:00.640 --> 04:03.276
Once we knock,
if we hear toilets flushing

04:03.343 --> 04:04.978
or drugs
being destroyed,

04:05.044 --> 04:06.312
we go in.

04:06.379 --> 04:08.414
So, you're telling me
you're gonna do nothing?

04:08.481 --> 04:10.583
No one said that.

04:11.985 --> 04:15.421
He's your grandson, right?

04:15.488 --> 04:17.624
Clearly, that makes him Teflon.

04:19.659 --> 04:21.594
You asked for
this meeting, Jeff.

04:21.661 --> 04:23.630
If anyone is giving
Detective Hill

04:23.696 --> 04:26.899
special treatment,
it's you.

04:28.401 --> 04:29.702
I got nothing more to say.

04:32.138 --> 04:33.172
(door opens)

04:35.208 --> 04:36.809
I don't know
what that guy's problem is.

04:36.876 --> 04:39.445
(scoffs)
I do. It's you.

04:39.512 --> 04:40.580
It's pretty clear

04:40.647 --> 04:41.648
you don't listen

04:41.714 --> 04:42.849
and you can't take direction.

04:42.915 --> 04:44.117
You're siding with him?

04:44.183 --> 04:46.085
No one's taking sides
with anyone.

04:46.152 --> 04:48.421
If we had done things my way,
our target would be in custody

04:48.488 --> 04:50.790
right now, charged with
possession with intent to sell,

04:50.857 --> 04:52.992
instead of back out
on the street.

04:55.194 --> 04:56.796
Boy...

04:57.997 --> 04:59.932
Sid, give us the room.

05:05.071 --> 05:06.939
(sighs)

05:09.142 --> 05:12.045
You ever notice how, when
you've got a beef with someone,

05:12.111 --> 05:15.114
it's always that other person
who's always dead wrong?

05:15.181 --> 05:16.215
I hadn't, no.

05:16.282 --> 05:17.717
I have.

05:19.218 --> 05:22.522
(sighs) You know,
no one's perfect, Joe.

05:22.588 --> 05:25.692
I know that. Do you know that?

05:25.758 --> 05:28.027
I'm pretty sure I do.

05:28.094 --> 05:29.762
Well, it can be hard
to tell sometimes.

05:29.829 --> 05:33.166
Especially when it suits
your take on things.

05:33.232 --> 05:35.768
Agree to disagree.

05:37.103 --> 05:39.839
Sorry, I can't do it on this.

05:43.676 --> 05:46.946
♪ ♪

06:06.632 --> 06:10.470
No, she wasn't religious,
as far as I know.

06:10.536 --> 06:11.838
When's the last time
you saw Sarah?

06:11.904 --> 06:13.806
Night before last.
We went out to dinner.

06:13.873 --> 06:15.541
Right around the block
from her apartment.

06:15.608 --> 06:16.809
And what time
was that?

06:16.876 --> 06:18.044
8:00.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.912
Then what?

06:19.979 --> 06:23.149
Then I walked her home.
We kissed good night.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.017
You didn't stay overnight
with her?

06:25.084 --> 06:27.854
I had a big presentation
early the next morning.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.122
Was that unusual?

06:29.188 --> 06:30.523
What unusual?

06:30.590 --> 06:32.859
The presentation
or not staying the night?

06:32.925 --> 06:33.960
Both.

06:34.026 --> 06:35.161
Why?

06:35.228 --> 06:36.429
Just a question.

06:36.496 --> 06:38.564
Okay, well, I got
a question for you.

06:38.631 --> 06:41.834
Why don't you go and find
the guy who did this to Sarah?

06:41.901 --> 06:43.970
What you're doing
is trying to figure out

06:44.036 --> 06:45.905
if I killed my girlfriend.

06:45.972 --> 06:48.574
I'll save you the trouble.

06:48.641 --> 06:52.178
I did not kill Sarah.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.913
Any idea who did?

06:53.980 --> 06:55.148
Any idea who

06:55.214 --> 06:56.449
might've wanted to hurt her?

06:56.516 --> 06:57.984
Maybe had a problem with her?

06:58.050 --> 07:00.419
No.

07:00.486 --> 07:02.622
And you know why?

07:02.688 --> 07:06.225
Because she was
the nicest person I ever met.

07:06.292 --> 07:08.327
Everyone loved her,

07:08.394 --> 07:10.897
including me.

07:11.664 --> 07:14.167
So, if you got
any more questions,

07:14.233 --> 07:16.836
talk to my lawyer.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.707
(door opens)

07:21.774 --> 07:23.810
Did you speak
to Jennifer Carpenter

07:23.876 --> 07:25.678
when you responded
to the crime scene?

07:25.745 --> 07:28.347
Hi. Yeah.

07:28.414 --> 07:30.850
She said that Duarte
tried to rape her,

07:30.917 --> 07:32.885
and she killed him
in self-defense.

07:32.952 --> 07:33.920
Allegedly.

07:33.986 --> 07:35.221
You don't believe her?

07:35.288 --> 07:37.256
I don't know.
Were there any witnesses?

07:37.323 --> 07:38.524
Any evidence?

07:38.591 --> 07:39.926
Anyone to back up
the story?

07:39.992 --> 07:41.427
Well, what did she say?

07:41.494 --> 07:43.095
She refused to speak with me.

07:43.162 --> 07:45.164
She said an Officer Janko
told her

07:45.231 --> 07:47.099
to only speak with an attorney.

07:47.166 --> 07:49.468
Well, that's true,

07:49.535 --> 07:51.938
but I believe her, Erin.
She's not a murderer.

07:52.004 --> 07:53.439
I'm sorry, I'm confused,
are-are you

07:53.506 --> 07:55.441
Jennifer Carpenter's
attorney now?

07:55.508 --> 07:57.810
Actually, I am.

07:57.877 --> 07:59.178
(stammers)

07:59.245 --> 08:01.180
I'm representing
Jennifer Carpenter.

08:01.247 --> 08:02.715
Wait, she called you?

08:02.782 --> 08:04.417
Ah...

08:05.551 --> 08:06.586
I called him.

08:06.652 --> 08:07.987
Are you kidding me?

08:08.054 --> 08:10.890
She asked for the best
defense attorney I know.

08:10.957 --> 08:13.092
So, you counseled a defendant
who confessed

08:13.159 --> 08:14.360
to murder
not to speak

08:14.427 --> 08:15.661
to anyone,
and then you

08:15.728 --> 08:16.929
secured them an attorney?

08:16.996 --> 08:18.397
It was not like that.

08:18.464 --> 08:19.699
Which part of that wasn't true?

08:19.765 --> 08:21.267
If Jennifer asked
for a lawyer,

08:21.334 --> 08:22.568
it's Eddie's
obligation...

08:22.635 --> 08:24.103
It's actually not her obligation

08:24.170 --> 08:25.471
to secure a lawyer for people

08:25.538 --> 08:27.039
who stab other people to death.

08:31.677 --> 08:34.347
How about you stay
in your lane from now on?

08:41.854 --> 08:43.222
Joe Hill did
nothing wrong.

08:43.289 --> 08:45.725
The FBI just does things
a different way.

08:45.791 --> 08:47.493
But he's on an FBI task force,

08:47.560 --> 08:49.962
so you're supposed to follow
their rule book.

08:50.029 --> 08:52.665
Boss, I would've done
exactly what he did.

08:52.732 --> 08:54.467
GARRETT: Of course you would.
Let's use that

08:54.533 --> 08:57.570
as the barometer
for all FBI-NYPD relations.

08:57.637 --> 08:58.838
Sid would've done it.

08:58.905 --> 08:59.872
(scoffs)

08:59.939 --> 09:01.774
Well... (sighs)

09:01.841 --> 09:03.910
there's a way of doing things
that doesn't put

09:03.976 --> 09:06.579
everybody's back
up against the wall,

09:06.646 --> 09:09.682
and clearly Joe has not learned
the art of that.

09:09.749 --> 09:12.618
Like, play by the rules,
respect chain of command?

09:12.685 --> 09:14.153
Yeah.
GORMLEY: In this instance,

09:14.220 --> 09:15.988
he played by the rules.

09:16.055 --> 09:18.591
Except you can't play
by the NYPD rules

09:18.658 --> 09:20.526
when the FBI
is calling the shots.

09:20.593 --> 09:22.161
BAKER: Obviously, he
ruffled some feathers,

09:22.228 --> 09:23.829
but I do think
it'll blow over.

09:23.896 --> 09:26.065
Boss, my two cents?
He's a good cop.

09:26.132 --> 09:29.435
Yeah, with a chip on his
shoulder the size of a Buick.

09:29.502 --> 09:31.437
Because his
grandfather's the PC?

09:31.504 --> 09:33.339
(sighs) If that were so,

09:33.406 --> 09:35.875
he'd be like
some trust fund kid,

09:35.942 --> 09:38.411
born on third base
and thinks he hit a triple.

09:38.477 --> 09:40.947
So, no.

09:42.181 --> 09:44.350
He's not dumb
and he's not shallow,

09:44.417 --> 09:46.485
but...

09:46.552 --> 09:48.521
he is troubled.

09:48.587 --> 09:50.423
About what?

09:50.489 --> 09:53.793
(sighs) Sid, I have no idea.

09:59.065 --> 10:00.499
This is the last time.

10:00.566 --> 10:02.435
Fair enough.
We won't ask again.

10:02.501 --> 10:04.937
She has petechiae in the eyes,

10:05.004 --> 10:07.773
swollen lips,
these marks on her neck.

10:07.840 --> 10:10.543
She died due to
asphyxiation

10:10.609 --> 10:12.278
as a result
of external pressure.

10:12.345 --> 10:13.813
Manual strangulation.

10:13.879 --> 10:15.348
Any signs

10:15.414 --> 10:16.716
of sexual assault?

10:16.782 --> 10:19.485
We did a rape kit.
I'll rush the testing.

10:19.552 --> 10:21.053
Was she tortured or anything?

10:21.120 --> 10:22.355
She was bound.

10:22.421 --> 10:23.522
These marks
on her wrists.

10:23.589 --> 10:24.824
Duct tape is my guess.

10:24.890 --> 10:26.292
Anything else you could tell us?

10:26.359 --> 10:27.994
Well, I think he took a trophy.

10:28.060 --> 10:29.095
What kind of trophy?

10:30.363 --> 10:32.865
See right here?
A locket of her hair.

10:32.932 --> 10:34.533
Too bad he didn't leave one.

10:34.600 --> 10:37.203
No, surprisingly there was
no trace evidence.

10:37.269 --> 10:39.939
And there's no chance
she cut that herself?

10:40.006 --> 10:42.241
Maybe she got gum
stuck in it or something.

10:42.308 --> 10:45.077
No. She had
a perfect manicure.

10:45.144 --> 10:46.445
She just had a pedicure.

10:46.512 --> 10:48.114
Her legs were waxed.
Her eyebrows were done.

10:48.180 --> 10:50.416
This was a young woman
who was very well put together.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.118
She wasn't sloppy.

10:52.184 --> 10:54.153
Well, let's hope to God he was.
(phone chimes)

10:54.220 --> 10:56.455
Danny, we got another body.

10:58.724 --> 11:00.693
BAEZ:
Maryanne Kauffman.

11:00.760 --> 11:01.994
25 years old.

11:02.061 --> 11:04.263
Looks like
she was strangled, too.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.731
Same staged body,

11:05.798 --> 11:07.666
same rosary beads.

11:07.733 --> 11:08.968
And another note.

11:09.035 --> 11:10.836
"Return unto me,

11:10.903 --> 11:12.772
for I have
redeemed thee."

11:12.838 --> 11:15.608
Looks like we have
a serial killer on our hands.

11:15.674 --> 11:18.144
Yeah, it does.

11:21.347 --> 11:24.050
(knock on door)

11:24.116 --> 11:26.052
Hi.

11:26.118 --> 11:28.387
Hi. (sighs)

11:28.454 --> 11:30.756
Can I come in?

11:30.823 --> 11:32.691
Sure.

11:34.393 --> 11:36.829
I take it you
are not happy

11:36.896 --> 11:39.498
that I've taken
this case.

11:39.565 --> 11:42.802
Just gonna be fodder
for the press, Jack.

11:42.868 --> 11:45.571
Not to mention,
you didn't give me a heads-up

11:45.638 --> 11:47.006
that Eddie
called you in on this.

11:48.407 --> 11:51.610
Erin, you broke up with
me because you thought

11:51.677 --> 11:53.712
that I wouldn't look
good as your partner

11:53.779 --> 11:55.414
coming up to your run,

11:55.481 --> 11:58.884
but now you also want to
dictate what cases I'll take?

11:58.951 --> 12:00.586
Did you really have
to take the one

12:00.653 --> 12:02.388
that I'm personally handling?

12:02.455 --> 12:04.290
Oh, so now I'm supposed to say
to my clients,

12:04.356 --> 12:07.226
"Hold on, I can't let you know
if I'm gonna represent you

12:07.293 --> 12:09.862
"until I make sure that my
ex-wife isn't the prosecutor

12:09.929 --> 12:11.564
on your case"? Seriously?

12:11.630 --> 12:14.767
Okay, when you put it that way,
it does sound a little...

12:14.834 --> 12:16.235
Unreasonable?

12:16.302 --> 12:19.772
Intrusive? Insulting? It is.

12:19.839 --> 12:22.608
Okay, you made your point.

12:22.675 --> 12:25.144
Jennifer Carpenter
is my client now,

12:25.211 --> 12:27.113
so please don't speak with
her unless I'm present.

12:27.179 --> 12:28.881
Well, I would like
to speak to her to see

12:28.948 --> 12:30.649
if she did act
in self-defense

12:30.716 --> 12:33.052
and to know whether or not
I should charge her.

12:33.119 --> 12:34.320
No.

12:34.386 --> 12:36.188
No?
No, you can't.

12:36.255 --> 12:40.092
She made her statement,
so ball's in your court now.

12:41.961 --> 12:44.964
May the best man or woman win.

12:53.939 --> 12:56.575
BAEZ:
Both of our victims-- 20s,

12:56.642 --> 12:58.144
female, strangled.

12:58.210 --> 13:01.447
Doesn't exactly narrow it down.
Anything else in common?

13:01.514 --> 13:05.351
Different neighborhoods,
different gyms, jobs, clubs...

13:05.417 --> 13:07.319
I'm still looking,
but so far nothing.

13:07.386 --> 13:09.088
Well, there's this,

13:09.155 --> 13:10.222
rosary beads.

13:10.289 --> 13:12.758
Maybe we follow them.
(phone ringing)

13:14.593 --> 13:15.828
Reagan.

13:15.895 --> 13:18.564
Yeah, we're working
that case. Why?

13:18.631 --> 13:20.399
Okay.

13:20.466 --> 13:23.235
All right.
15 minutes.

13:24.270 --> 13:25.838
That's Rosanna Diaz
from the<i> Ledger.</i>

13:25.905 --> 13:27.306
She said she got
a letter from a guy

13:27.373 --> 13:30.376
claiming to be the one
who killed our two vics.

13:32.278 --> 13:34.513
(sighs)

13:34.580 --> 13:35.948
It arrived
this morning.

13:36.015 --> 13:37.383
We need to know everyone
who had contact with it

13:37.449 --> 13:38.684
once it came out
of the envelope.

13:38.751 --> 13:41.086
Uh, me, our photographer,
my editor.

13:41.153 --> 13:43.389
Maybe we should be asking
who didn't touch it.

13:43.455 --> 13:46.225
We were careful, but we had
to run with it. It's news.

13:46.292 --> 13:47.593
Well, no, it's evidence,

13:47.660 --> 13:49.728
and if it's contaminated now,
that's a problem.

13:49.795 --> 13:50.930
I didn't have
to call you at all.

13:50.996 --> 13:52.031
Well, we can
just charge you

13:52.097 --> 13:53.632
with tampering
physical evidence.

13:53.699 --> 13:55.234
And I can tell you
to kiss my ass.

13:55.301 --> 13:57.336
All right, time-out.
Why don't we just start over?

13:57.403 --> 13:58.671
Okay? Where is it?

13:59.672 --> 14:00.839
ROSANNA:
Arrived at 2:15.

14:00.906 --> 14:02.408
Arrived how?
Mail.

14:02.474 --> 14:04.476
I assumed it was legit
because he sent these pictures

14:04.543 --> 14:06.045
of Sarah and Maryanne with it.

14:08.314 --> 14:09.815
DANNY:
"I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to do it,

14:09.882 --> 14:11.317
"but I can't
help myself.

14:11.383 --> 14:13.018
"I hope the police
are smart enough to find me

14:13.085 --> 14:15.254
before I have to do it again."

14:17.590 --> 14:19.992
Let's get Crime Scene up here.

14:31.470 --> 14:33.739
Detective Hill asked
if he could have a moment.

14:35.074 --> 14:36.609
Oh.

14:37.476 --> 14:38.777
Temperature?

14:38.844 --> 14:40.179
Simmering.

14:40.246 --> 14:42.381
Okay. (chuckles)

14:42.448 --> 14:44.350
Let's have him.

14:55.094 --> 14:56.462
(door closes)

14:56.528 --> 15:00.332
You transferred me to the
chief of D's office? Why?

15:02.234 --> 15:04.470
When you commit an error
in the field,

15:04.536 --> 15:06.672
you generally
are taken off the field.

15:06.739 --> 15:07.906
I didn't do anything wrong.

15:07.973 --> 15:09.942
I followed
the letter of the law.

15:10.009 --> 15:11.644
There is a chain of command.

15:11.710 --> 15:14.346
Last time I looked,
you weren't at the top of it.

15:14.413 --> 15:17.216
So this assignment is,
what, like a time-out?

15:17.283 --> 15:18.817
Like I'm not playing well
with others?

15:18.884 --> 15:21.020
My hope is that

15:21.086 --> 15:24.923
you will use it
as a time to reflect.

15:24.990 --> 15:26.592
On my shortcomings?

15:27.826 --> 15:30.362
On your potential
and what the obstacles

15:30.429 --> 15:33.299
may be to achieving it.

15:34.366 --> 15:36.702
You describe my old man as a...

15:36.769 --> 15:39.204
a hard charger, a "first one in"
kind of guy, right?

15:39.271 --> 15:41.607
So maybe what this
is actually about is

15:41.674 --> 15:44.076
you trying to make sure that
history doesn't repeat itself.

15:44.143 --> 15:45.911
Maybe reflect on that.

15:49.815 --> 15:51.784
Hold on.

15:58.290 --> 16:00.826
(sighs) I have reflected

16:00.893 --> 16:02.394
on just that,

16:02.461 --> 16:03.929
many times,

16:03.996 --> 16:06.365
often in the middle
of the night,

16:06.432 --> 16:08.667
and I can tell you
one thing for certain--

16:08.734 --> 16:11.370
whatever this thing of ours is,

16:11.437 --> 16:13.405
it ain't that.

16:18.577 --> 16:21.246
Just so's you know.

16:21.313 --> 16:23.716
(writing)

16:34.360 --> 16:35.527
ABETEMARCO:
Hey.

16:35.594 --> 16:37.196
Detectives were swamped,
so I helped

16:37.262 --> 16:38.630
reinterview
a bunch of the women

16:38.697 --> 16:40.165
in the office and, uh...

16:40.232 --> 16:41.533
And what are you doing here?

16:41.600 --> 16:43.135
I offered to help.

16:43.202 --> 16:44.803
I think you've helped enough.

16:44.870 --> 16:46.405
JANKO:
Well, I just feel

16:46.472 --> 16:48.407
strongly that this woman
is telling the truth.

16:48.474 --> 16:50.743
Yeah, well, then why even bother
investigating

16:50.809 --> 16:52.911
if you feel so strongly
she's innocent?

16:52.978 --> 16:55.881
There's something
about this case.

16:55.948 --> 16:58.150
With you, there's always
something about every case,

16:58.217 --> 16:59.284
every time.

16:59.351 --> 17:00.853
You overstepped
on so many levels,

17:00.919 --> 17:02.488
I don't even know
where to begin.

17:02.554 --> 17:04.523
Erin, if you just
take a look at...

17:04.590 --> 17:06.892
I think you should go back
to patrol, Eddie.

17:06.959 --> 17:08.627
I've got this.

17:13.031 --> 17:15.734
You know, not for nothing,
she really helped.

17:15.801 --> 17:18.771
Not for nothing is something,
and I know she wants to help,

17:18.837 --> 17:21.473
but you know what the road
to hell is paved with?

17:21.540 --> 17:24.343
Yes, but apparently
the road to promotion

17:24.410 --> 17:26.879
at Duarte's company is sex.

17:26.945 --> 17:28.514
How so?

17:28.580 --> 17:30.015
We talked to almost everyone
who worked there.

17:30.082 --> 17:32.451
They all say that Duarte
had a reputation

17:32.518 --> 17:34.653
for forcing sex
on his female employees.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.622
Is there any record
of complaints?

17:36.688 --> 17:38.624
Nothing in the online
complaint system.

17:38.690 --> 17:41.727
I subpoenaed HR records.

17:41.794 --> 17:44.530
His M.O. seems to be
to handpick and hire

17:44.596 --> 17:47.065
young, attractive women
and hold promotion

17:47.132 --> 17:48.801
over their heads for sex.

17:48.867 --> 17:50.903
And if they
say no, well,

17:50.969 --> 17:54.440
guy like that, it's not a big
leap for him to force himself.

17:54.506 --> 17:56.675
And how about
Jennifer Carpenter?

17:56.742 --> 17:57.910
According to co-workers,

17:57.976 --> 17:59.578
Jennifer
told them that Duarte raped her.

17:59.645 --> 18:01.113
And did she file a report?

18:01.180 --> 18:02.714
She did not. No.

18:02.781 --> 18:04.049
So, she was raped, and instead

18:04.116 --> 18:06.552
of filing a report
with the police,

18:06.618 --> 18:09.788
she decided to get revenge
by stabbing him?

18:09.855 --> 18:11.156
She's claiming that
she only stabbed him

18:11.223 --> 18:12.357
out of fear for her life.

18:12.424 --> 18:14.693
Well, Jack knows his best shot

18:14.760 --> 18:17.429
is to convince the jury
that it was self-defense.

18:17.496 --> 18:19.131
So you think
it was premeditated?

18:19.198 --> 18:21.567
I mean, I need to know
if she believed

18:21.633 --> 18:23.602
he was using...

18:23.669 --> 18:24.703
or going to use

18:24.770 --> 18:26.238
deadly physical force.

18:26.305 --> 18:29.875
I mean, were there any...
injuries or defense wounds?

18:29.942 --> 18:31.410
No.

18:31.477 --> 18:35.113
Did any of these other women
witness the attempted rape

18:35.180 --> 18:36.515
or the subsequent murder?

18:36.582 --> 18:39.618
No, Jennifer arrived early,
as did Duarte.

18:39.685 --> 18:41.320
And what about
the murder weapon?

18:41.386 --> 18:43.989
A seven-inch fixed blade knife.

18:45.357 --> 18:47.292
Find out where that
murder weapon came from

18:47.359 --> 18:48.360
and who owns it.

18:48.427 --> 18:50.996
You got it.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.601
Just blurted it out
like that?

18:55.667 --> 18:58.303
Yeah, she didn't try
to hide anything.

18:58.370 --> 18:59.738
Maybe that's why
I believed her.

18:59.805 --> 19:02.307
Sh-She even looked
traumatized.

19:02.374 --> 19:04.209
Please, um...
Okay.

19:04.276 --> 19:06.945
And Badillo,
what did he think?

19:07.012 --> 19:09.982
Um, I mean,
he believed her, too,

19:10.048 --> 19:13.085
but you should probably
talk to him directly

19:13.151 --> 19:14.086
about that.

19:14.152 --> 19:16.755
I will, but this really helps.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.458
So, what happened?

19:19.525 --> 19:22.194
Uh, I can't really share with
you what Jennifer said to me.

19:22.261 --> 19:24.630
No, not this. What happened
with you and Erin?

19:24.696 --> 19:25.864
I mean,
you two seemed

19:25.931 --> 19:27.399
perfect for each other.

19:27.466 --> 19:29.334
Um...

19:29.401 --> 19:31.436
Uh, we are. Or, uh,

19:31.503 --> 19:33.005
we-we were.

19:33.071 --> 19:35.641
Then why'd you break up
in the first place?

19:37.309 --> 19:40.812
Um, uh, we were too young
when we got married.

19:40.879 --> 19:43.015
We were too young
when we became parents.

19:43.081 --> 19:45.717
There's plenty of people
get married young

19:45.784 --> 19:47.019
and have kids young.

19:47.085 --> 19:50.589
Yup, they're, um,
they're not both lawyers,

19:50.656 --> 19:52.891
juggling careers,
uh, and a baby,

19:52.958 --> 19:55.527
and they're
not married into a...

19:55.594 --> 19:57.763
a very Irish Catholic family

19:57.829 --> 20:00.432
that was very
opinionated and vocal

20:00.499 --> 20:02.334
about every move
that we made.

20:02.401 --> 20:04.369
Mm, so you blame the family?

20:04.436 --> 20:05.871
No. No, no, no.

20:05.938 --> 20:08.607
Um, I, uh,
I blame me.

20:08.674 --> 20:09.875
Um...

20:09.942 --> 20:13.345
I wasn't, uh,
mature enough

20:13.412 --> 20:15.914
for all of that.

20:15.981 --> 20:18.216
Kind of the,
the poster boy

20:18.283 --> 20:21.920
for, uh, "don't know what
you got until it's gone."

20:21.987 --> 20:24.056
But, I mean, it's not gone.

20:24.122 --> 20:27.092
You can still fix it.
You could still be together.

20:27.159 --> 20:29.595
Erin's priority
right now

20:29.661 --> 20:31.530
is making D.A.,

20:31.597 --> 20:33.465
and I don't fit
into that equation.

20:33.532 --> 20:35.067
I mean, she actually
thinks that

20:35.133 --> 20:39.304
being seen with me
would hurt her chances.

20:39.371 --> 20:42.007
So, you're just gonna walk away?

20:42.074 --> 20:45.377
Much as I appreciate
your concern for us,

20:45.444 --> 20:47.546
uh, a relationship takes

20:47.613 --> 20:49.915
two committed people to work.

20:51.717 --> 20:53.752
Back to the case?

20:53.819 --> 20:56.021
Right this way, Doc.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.422
Hey.

20:57.489 --> 20:59.291
Hey, this is
Dr. Walker,

20:59.358 --> 21:00.792
forensic psychologist.

21:00.859 --> 21:02.427
Thanks for helping out.

21:02.494 --> 21:03.629
DANNY:
Why don't you have a seat?

21:03.695 --> 21:05.998
(clears throat)
I looked at everything

21:06.064 --> 21:07.833
you sent.

21:07.899 --> 21:09.668
He's certainly meticulous

21:09.735 --> 21:11.470
and very intelligent.

21:11.536 --> 21:13.405
He's covered
his tracks,

21:13.472 --> 21:15.607
and that takes a lot
of thought to be able to evade

21:15.674 --> 21:17.743
seasoned homicide detectives
like you.

21:17.809 --> 21:20.245
Okay, well, now that
we know how smart he is,

21:20.312 --> 21:23.482
any suggestions on how we
can nail this son of a bitch?

21:23.548 --> 21:26.318
He's white, probably late-30s

21:26.385 --> 21:28.353
to mid-40s, single,

21:28.420 --> 21:30.055
had some kind
of tragic

21:30.122 --> 21:32.557
childhood, an abusive one,

21:32.624 --> 21:33.925
a warped relationship

21:33.992 --> 21:36.128
with his mother,
who was very religious,

21:36.194 --> 21:37.596
since he's making

21:37.663 --> 21:39.164
a statement
with the rosary beads.

21:39.231 --> 21:43.101
He has a post-graduate degree
and is bipolar.

21:43.168 --> 21:45.070
You got all that
from two bodies?

21:45.137 --> 21:47.172
Can you tell us what he likes
to eat for breakfast?

21:47.239 --> 21:49.408
Detective, it's not just
the bodies,

21:49.474 --> 21:51.309
it's the notes,

21:51.376 --> 21:52.678
it's the posing,

21:52.744 --> 21:54.379
the rosary beads,

21:54.446 --> 21:56.014
strangulation,

21:56.081 --> 21:58.550
the, uh, lack of trace evidence,
the Bible quotes.

21:58.617 --> 22:00.886
Well, outside of the obvious,
we still can't make

22:00.952 --> 22:02.754
any connection
between the two victims.

22:02.821 --> 22:06.091
They're both similar age,
and they both

22:06.158 --> 22:07.492
seem to have been
meticulous

22:07.559 --> 22:09.027
about their appearance.

22:09.094 --> 22:10.896
That might be
what he was killing.

22:10.962 --> 22:13.398
Meticulousness?
What, perfection?

22:13.465 --> 22:16.535
Sophistication. Youth.

22:16.601 --> 22:18.503
Uh, female empowerment.

22:18.570 --> 22:20.172
They're both brunette.
Yes.

22:20.238 --> 22:22.874
It's, uh, most likely
that his mother was a brunette,

22:22.941 --> 22:26.311
and I'll assure you that
most of his victims will be.

22:26.378 --> 22:27.612
Still, could really use

22:27.679 --> 22:29.614
some thoughts on how
we can get this guy.

22:29.681 --> 22:32.150
He sent you a message. Several.

22:32.217 --> 22:33.952
Uh-huh.
Perhaps you should
send one back.

22:34.019 --> 22:35.454
What are you suggesting?

22:35.520 --> 22:38.490
Give him some attention.
Ask the public for help.

22:38.557 --> 22:41.159
Can't give this guy
the satisfaction, Doc.

22:41.226 --> 22:44.029
I mean, besides, we have no idea
what this guy looks like,

22:44.096 --> 22:46.431
and we have no idea how
he chooses his victims.

22:46.498 --> 22:48.767
(phone chimes)
He's killed two victims
in 24 hours, so he is

22:48.834 --> 22:50.402
in a cooling off period,

22:50.469 --> 22:52.237
but who knows
how long that will last?

22:52.304 --> 22:54.773
The lab reached out.
They pulled a partial print

22:54.840 --> 22:56.441
off the cross
on the rosary beads.

22:56.508 --> 22:57.743
Did they run it?
Yeah.

22:57.809 --> 22:59.611
Comes back to a one
Martin Langley,

22:59.678 --> 23:03.482
and guess what. He owns
a religious supply store.

23:03.548 --> 23:05.317
You don't say.

23:09.921 --> 23:11.256
DANNY:
Excuse me, sir.

23:11.323 --> 23:13.692
Detective Reagan.
My partner's Detective Baez.

23:13.759 --> 23:14.860
You have a minute?

23:14.926 --> 23:15.961
Yeah, what can I
do for you?

23:16.027 --> 23:17.662
You recognize this?

23:17.729 --> 23:19.965
Can I see?

23:20.031 --> 23:21.833
Black onyx rosary beads.

23:21.900 --> 23:23.435
I sell them.

23:23.502 --> 23:25.070
Yeah, you want to tell me
what this is about?

23:25.137 --> 23:27.105
Those were found
at two separate crime scenes

23:27.172 --> 23:29.608
with fingerprints on them,
your fingerprints,

23:29.674 --> 23:31.009
and they were
the only fingerprints.

23:31.076 --> 23:33.011
(chuckles) Because I sell them.

23:33.078 --> 23:34.880
Mm-hmm.
I handle them

23:34.946 --> 23:36.948
when I'm packing them up
for customers.

23:37.015 --> 23:39.384
I even mail them myself.

23:39.451 --> 23:41.987
Where were you Thursday between
the hours of 6:00 to 9:00 a.m.,

23:42.053 --> 23:43.722
and 3:00 to 5:00 p.m.?

23:43.789 --> 23:46.224
I spent the day with my mother.

23:46.291 --> 23:48.226
She's in the Bristol
in Great Neck.

23:48.293 --> 23:51.263
You can call there.
They'll verify.

23:51.329 --> 23:52.764
Okay, we will.

23:52.831 --> 23:54.966
Do you know of anyone who may
have purchased these recently?

23:55.033 --> 23:57.435
A-a lot of people purchase them.

23:57.502 --> 24:00.305
What about someone
who purchased several at once?

24:00.372 --> 24:03.308
Um...

24:06.178 --> 24:08.847
Oh, yeah, now I remember.

24:08.914 --> 24:11.249
There was a gentleman
who bought ten of these.

24:11.316 --> 24:12.484
Ten?

24:12.551 --> 24:14.719
We need to know
who purchased them.

24:14.786 --> 24:16.855
I'm sorry, he paid cash.

24:16.922 --> 24:20.025
Okay, well, can you
remember him at all?

24:20.091 --> 24:21.560
Give us a description?

24:21.626 --> 24:23.495
He was in his 40s,

24:23.562 --> 24:26.298
he wore glasses and a suit,

24:26.364 --> 24:29.167
and he kept complaining
because he'd gotten a ticket

24:29.234 --> 24:31.670
for parking in the
"no standing" zone outside.

24:31.736 --> 24:33.772
Outside, okay. Uh, how long ago?

24:33.839 --> 24:35.540
About a month ago.

24:35.607 --> 24:37.409
Uh-huh.
I-I remember

24:37.475 --> 24:39.644
he asked
about the St. Benedict medal.

24:39.711 --> 24:41.880
St. Benedict?
He say why?

24:41.947 --> 24:43.648
No, but most people want
that particular one

24:43.715 --> 24:45.584
because it's used
to ward off evil.

24:45.650 --> 24:48.053
Don't they all ward off evil?

24:48.119 --> 24:50.055
Uh, somewhat.

24:50.121 --> 24:55.060
But St. Benedict is the medal
used during exorcisms.

25:09.374 --> 25:11.543
Chief asked me to drop these off
for the commissioner.

25:11.610 --> 25:14.646
Thanks. Commissioner asked
if you'd say hi.

25:20.285 --> 25:21.219
Thanks.

25:21.286 --> 25:23.154
(door opens)

25:23.221 --> 25:24.923
(Frank sighs)

25:25.724 --> 25:28.426
Want to have a seat this time?

25:33.231 --> 25:35.734
Did you have the chief
send me up here as an excuse

25:35.800 --> 25:37.402
to get me to come in again?

25:37.469 --> 25:41.439
(sighs) I'm pretty sure the
chief sent you up here himself

25:41.506 --> 25:43.608
with some intel
he wanted me to look at.

25:43.675 --> 25:45.143
That's kind of how that goes.

25:45.210 --> 25:47.913
It's just a coincidence
that you transferred me

25:47.979 --> 25:49.347
so I'm right under your nose?

25:49.414 --> 25:52.584
My chief of Ds is a wizard
at making

25:52.651 --> 25:56.187
almost any move he wants
while somehow staying

25:56.254 --> 25:57.222
inside the box.

25:57.289 --> 25:59.524
I just thought

25:59.591 --> 26:01.593
maybe you could learn
a thing or two

26:01.660 --> 26:02.861
being around him.

26:02.928 --> 26:03.929
Does every other cop
that screws up

26:03.995 --> 26:05.497
get sent to One PP for a week?

26:05.563 --> 26:08.199
My only agenda here
is to try to prevent

26:08.266 --> 26:11.403
a potentially great cop
from getting himself

26:11.469 --> 26:12.938
bounced off the job.

26:13.004 --> 26:15.941
Your name is Joe Hill,
but in that sense

26:16.007 --> 26:18.677
it could just as easily be
Joe Blow.

26:20.578 --> 26:22.113
I never know where
I stand with you.

26:22.180 --> 26:25.517
Half the time I feel like
I'm competing with a ghost.

26:25.583 --> 26:27.552
(sighs)

26:27.619 --> 26:29.154
Whose ghost?

26:29.220 --> 26:30.555
Come on.

26:30.622 --> 26:34.292
Did you walk by a big
bronze statue of him

26:34.359 --> 26:35.427
on your way in here?

26:35.493 --> 26:36.494
Not literally.

26:36.561 --> 26:38.129
Not anything.

26:41.766 --> 26:45.170
He was a good cop
and could have been a great one.

26:45.236 --> 26:48.073
He was your father and would
have been a great one.

26:48.139 --> 26:51.943
He was my son, and he was
a wonderful son.

26:52.010 --> 26:56.581
And he's gone way too soon.
That's all.

26:59.317 --> 27:00.385
How is that all?

27:00.452 --> 27:02.554
No, I mean, that's everything.

27:02.620 --> 27:05.724
He wasn't a legend
or a mythical figure.

27:05.790 --> 27:10.195
He was a good man,
and I wish he was still with us.

27:12.230 --> 27:15.000
Most especially for you.

27:20.372 --> 27:23.041
That's a good answer to a...

27:23.108 --> 27:25.577
question that neither
of us asked.

27:26.711 --> 27:28.880
The dynamic that I have
with you,

27:28.947 --> 27:30.882
that I have with your family,

27:30.949 --> 27:32.317
didn't come out of a vacuum.

27:32.384 --> 27:34.386
I'm being measured
against something here.

27:34.452 --> 27:36.121
And if you tell me that

27:36.187 --> 27:38.423
it's not against my father,
I'll believe you

27:38.490 --> 27:39.758
It's not.

27:39.824 --> 27:41.693
Then tell me what it is.

27:43.528 --> 27:44.496
I can't.

27:44.562 --> 27:46.131
You mean you won't.

27:47.766 --> 27:52.170
No, I mean I can't right now.

27:52.237 --> 27:56.541
I don't know which one of us
has the answer to that.

27:58.243 --> 28:01.613
Well, if you figure it out,
you know where to find me.

28:12.123 --> 28:13.525
I will be charging
your client

28:13.591 --> 28:15.193
with manslaughter
in the first degree.

28:15.260 --> 28:17.829
For protecting herself?
Oh, come on, Jack.

28:17.896 --> 28:20.965
She told coworkers
he raped her in the past.

28:21.032 --> 28:23.001
Yeah, exactly, and she didn't
want it to happen again.

28:23.068 --> 28:25.570
She didn't file a report,
didn't go to the police.

28:25.637 --> 28:27.539
We've both seen plenty of cases

28:27.605 --> 28:28.940
of women afraid to come forward.

28:29.007 --> 28:31.276
And she continued to work there?

28:31.342 --> 28:34.212
Did it ever occur to you that
she couldn't afford to quit?

28:34.279 --> 28:37.315
Did it ever occur to you
that this is revenge killing?

28:37.382 --> 28:39.284
What, "hell hath no fury"?

28:39.350 --> 28:42.587
No bruising, no marks,
no witnesses, no corroborations.

28:42.654 --> 28:44.422
Her coworkers said

28:44.489 --> 28:46.624
this was consensual sex,

28:46.691 --> 28:48.660
and she was angry
she didn't get promoted.

28:48.726 --> 28:49.961
Hearsay.

28:50.028 --> 28:51.496
I haven't seen any evidence

28:51.563 --> 28:52.964
that it's not cold-blooded.

28:53.031 --> 28:55.767
A jury's not going
to convict her.

28:55.834 --> 28:57.235
She's sympathetic,

28:57.302 --> 28:59.037
and he was a monster
by all standards.

28:59.104 --> 29:01.973
And there are plenty of
employees who can verify that.

29:02.040 --> 29:05.477
"He had it coming"
is not much of a defense.

29:05.543 --> 29:10.381
And justice is not only for
victims of good character, Jack.

29:10.448 --> 29:12.851
If there are even a few women
on that grand jury,

29:12.917 --> 29:14.586
you're not gonna get
an indictment.

29:14.652 --> 29:16.688
Watch me.

29:16.754 --> 29:19.023
With pleasure.

29:28.366 --> 29:30.301
Don't all talk at once.

29:30.368 --> 29:32.504
Sorry, Pop,
I'm a little preoccupied.

29:32.570 --> 29:34.739
Me, too.
DANNY: No wonder.

29:34.806 --> 29:36.808
Heard Jack's defending
Jennifer Carpenter.

29:36.875 --> 29:39.210
Didn't realize he was
chasing ambulances now.

29:39.277 --> 29:41.913
Apparently he gets
personal invitations

29:41.980 --> 29:43.748
from within the family.

29:43.815 --> 29:45.683
Who?
Yeah, who?

29:45.750 --> 29:47.118
Me, okay?

29:47.185 --> 29:49.921
You could just say it, Erin.
I asked him.

29:49.988 --> 29:52.290
So you're, uh, helping out
defense attorneys now?

29:52.357 --> 29:55.026
Yeah, aren't you supposed to
be on the prosecutors' side?

29:55.093 --> 29:56.761
I'm not on anyone's side.

29:56.828 --> 29:58.229
The victim said
he raped her.

29:58.296 --> 29:59.597
She stabbed him
because she was afraid

29:59.664 --> 30:00.899
he was gonna
rape her again.

30:00.965 --> 30:02.233
Or it was premeditated.

30:02.300 --> 30:03.735
But maybe we shouldn't speak
about this

30:03.801 --> 30:04.903
at family dinner.

30:04.969 --> 30:07.138
Why not?
We always talk shop.

30:07.205 --> 30:08.606
Maybe this time we should
take a break

30:08.673 --> 30:10.542
from bringing the work home.
Yeah.

30:10.608 --> 30:12.777
Thank you.
But tell the truth.

30:12.844 --> 30:14.345
You were playing matchmaker,
weren't you?

30:14.412 --> 30:15.880
I was not.

30:15.947 --> 30:17.749
I can't blame you.
I always liked Uncle jack.

30:17.815 --> 30:19.050
That makes one of us.

30:19.117 --> 30:20.585
That's not what
I was doing.

30:20.652 --> 30:22.820
Well, this doesn't necessarily
have anything to do

30:22.887 --> 30:24.522
with past history.

30:24.589 --> 30:27.525
Exactly.
My intentions were pure.

30:27.592 --> 30:29.093
Oh, save it.

30:29.160 --> 30:32.463
Maybe we could give each other
the benefit of the doubt.

30:33.565 --> 30:34.632
Thank you.

30:34.699 --> 30:36.134
Or they could just
duke it out.

30:36.201 --> 30:37.602
You've been spending
too much time with your dad.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.337
Sorry.
JAMIE:
You can deny it all you want,

30:39.404 --> 30:42.440
but I think everything is
influenced by past history.

30:42.507 --> 30:44.175
So, what, you're saying
people don't move on from things

30:44.242 --> 30:47.011
or get over things?
They just harbor grudges?

30:47.078 --> 30:49.147
No, but that's about
forgiveness, not amnesia.

30:49.214 --> 30:51.549
Those who do not
remember the past

30:51.616 --> 30:53.117
are condemned to repeat it.

30:53.184 --> 30:54.852
Remembering the past is good,

30:54.919 --> 30:58.223
but sometimes it's just as good
to let it go.

30:58.289 --> 31:01.426
Otherwise you get
Irish Alzheimer's:

31:01.492 --> 31:04.395
forget everything
except the grudges.

31:10.235 --> 31:13.705
JANKO:
You know, it's even worse
doing dish duty with you

31:13.771 --> 31:15.840
when you're not
talking to me.

31:18.576 --> 31:20.945
I thought the guy was like
a Harvey Weinstein type,

31:21.012 --> 31:24.082
and I didn't want this woman
to get railroaded.

31:24.148 --> 31:27.018
And what makes you think
I would railroad anyone?

31:27.085 --> 31:28.486
Oh, that's not
what I meant.

31:28.553 --> 31:30.288
I meant I...

31:30.355 --> 31:32.957
I want her to have
good representation.

31:33.024 --> 31:34.792
So you went to
Jack's office?

31:34.859 --> 31:36.594
He had questions
about her confession.

31:36.661 --> 31:39.931
And you usually help out
the defense attorneys?

31:39.998 --> 31:41.866
He's not just
a defense attorney.

31:41.933 --> 31:44.035
He's part of this family.

31:44.102 --> 31:46.571
Hmm, technically not.

31:46.638 --> 31:48.373
Okay, well, he's a great lawyer,

31:48.439 --> 31:50.842
and that's why I called him.
Okay?

31:50.908 --> 31:53.011
Are you really gonna tell me

31:53.077 --> 31:56.814
you didn't do this in some
misguided attempt

31:56.881 --> 31:58.750
to get us to reconcile?

31:58.816 --> 32:00.885
I mean, I'll admit it,
I-I like the idea

32:00.952 --> 32:03.721
of you two working together.
Is that so wrong?

32:03.788 --> 32:05.456
Yeah, it is.

32:05.523 --> 32:07.992
You two are perfect
for each other.

32:09.060 --> 32:10.495
Everyone else might not agree,
but I see it

32:10.561 --> 32:11.963
whenever you're together.

32:12.030 --> 32:13.698
And I don't want you
to miss out on the one guy

32:13.765 --> 32:16.067
I've ever seen you happy with.

32:20.938 --> 32:23.041
A Toyota Camry parked
in a "no standing" zone,

32:23.107 --> 32:24.776
license plate number

32:24.842 --> 32:28.346
2-X-ray-5107.

32:29.314 --> 32:32.617
It's registered to
a Dianne Corchran,

32:32.684 --> 32:34.452
35, from Mineola.

32:34.519 --> 32:39.324
Honda Pilot,
Charlie-Nora-Thomas-4712.

32:41.893 --> 32:42.927
Wait a minute,
read me that again.

32:42.994 --> 32:46.931
Charlie-Nora-Thomas-4712.

32:46.998 --> 32:48.966
This can't be.
What?

32:49.033 --> 32:51.502
It's registered to a Dr. Walker.

32:51.569 --> 32:52.770
Our Dr. Walker?

32:52.837 --> 32:54.405
Well, that's
a damn good question.

32:56.841 --> 32:58.176
(sighs)

32:59.143 --> 33:01.012
Is the doctor in? Great.

33:01.079 --> 33:02.547
We'll find our way back.
Don't worry about it.

33:02.613 --> 33:04.482
You can't go in there.
He said not to disturb him.

33:04.549 --> 33:07.285
We'll just be a minute.
RECEPTIONIST: Excuse me!

33:08.886 --> 33:10.088
Hello, Doc.

33:10.154 --> 33:11.489
What can I do for you,
Detectives?

33:11.556 --> 33:12.724
You can start by telling us
what the hell

33:12.790 --> 33:14.092
kind of game you're playing.

33:14.158 --> 33:15.426
I have no clue
what you're talking about.

33:15.493 --> 33:16.994
You bought ten sets
of rosary beads,

33:17.061 --> 33:18.896
two of which ended up
on murder victims.

33:18.963 --> 33:21.032
Are you suggesting
I put them there?

33:21.099 --> 33:23.167
Murder victims that we
consulted you about.

33:23.234 --> 33:25.603
Yet you didn't mention
those rosary beads, did you?

33:25.670 --> 33:27.839
Hundreds of thousands of people
buy rosary beads.

33:27.905 --> 33:29.607
Where were you
between the hours

33:29.674 --> 33:31.909
of 6:00 to 9:00 a.m.,
and 3:00 to 5:00 p.m.

33:31.976 --> 33:33.444
Thursday?

33:33.511 --> 33:35.346
Well, most likely
I was at home.

33:35.413 --> 33:38.516
I keep very regular hours.
Do me a favor, Doc.

33:38.583 --> 33:40.051
Take your hands out
of your pockets, please.

33:40.118 --> 33:42.387
Right now!
Step over there.

33:42.453 --> 33:44.555
(chuckles):
This is ridiculous.

33:49.560 --> 33:51.262
(clears throat)

33:53.164 --> 33:55.266
You giving haircuts now, Doc?

33:55.333 --> 33:56.634
It's not what you think it is.

33:56.701 --> 33:58.636
You're under arrest,
you sick son of a bitch.

33:58.703 --> 34:00.371
Hands behind your back.
For the murders of
Sarah Montgomery...

34:00.438 --> 34:02.840
Janine, call Solomon and Rubin
and tell them I need

34:02.907 --> 34:04.275
their best criminal
defense attorney.

34:04.342 --> 34:06.744
...may be used against you
in a court of law.

34:06.811 --> 34:08.112
(handcuffs click)

34:16.687 --> 34:18.456
(humming)

34:18.523 --> 34:19.891
Your client's looking at
two counts of murder.

34:19.957 --> 34:21.025
He's innocent.

34:21.092 --> 34:22.827
Oh, really? Well, great.

34:22.894 --> 34:25.196
Then you won't mind him
answering a few questions for us

34:25.263 --> 34:27.465
so we can clear up
all the confusion.

34:27.532 --> 34:29.867
My client is a sick man,
Detective.

34:29.934 --> 34:30.968
You think?

34:31.035 --> 34:32.303
If he's innocent,
he should be able

34:32.370 --> 34:33.337
to give us an alibi.

34:33.404 --> 34:34.439
My client is suffering from

34:34.505 --> 34:36.107
extreme psychiatric distress

34:36.174 --> 34:37.909
brought on by his arrest
at his place of work.

34:37.975 --> 34:40.111
Or maybe it was brought on
by killing

34:40.178 --> 34:41.245
two innocent young women.

34:41.312 --> 34:42.447
(humming)
He's fearful and depressed,

34:42.513 --> 34:43.714
and I fear for his safety.

34:43.781 --> 34:45.049
I wonder how fearful
and depressed

34:45.116 --> 34:47.718
Sarah and Maryanne were
before he killed them.

34:47.785 --> 34:49.153
You want to talk
about that, Doc?!

34:49.220 --> 34:50.588
If you forgive others
their sins against you...

34:50.655 --> 34:52.256
Dr. Walker,
do not say another word.

34:52.323 --> 34:54.559
...your heavenly Father will
also forgive you.
Dr. Walker!

34:56.327 --> 34:57.795
Dr. Walker!
Hey!

34:57.862 --> 34:59.931
Hey, stop! Hey!
Dr. Walker!

34:59.997 --> 35:02.800
BAEZ: We need some help in here!
Stop! Stop.

35:02.867 --> 35:04.502
Come on.

35:04.569 --> 35:06.637
Get him a bus seat.

35:06.704 --> 35:09.006
Heavenly Father, forgive them
their trespasses.

35:09.073 --> 35:10.241
Shut up.

35:11.476 --> 35:13.344
He's clearly faking it.

35:13.411 --> 35:15.480
Look, I'd be happy to
encourage my client

35:15.546 --> 35:16.981
to answer your questions,

35:17.048 --> 35:18.616
but he clearly doesn't have
the mental capacity

35:18.683 --> 35:20.084
to sit through
an interrogation.

35:20.151 --> 35:21.919
I'd like him evaluated
by a professional.

35:21.986 --> 35:23.421
You really think he's gonna
get out of

35:23.488 --> 35:25.656
these charges he's facing
by pretending to be crazy?

35:25.723 --> 35:27.859
I think he won't face
any charges

35:27.925 --> 35:30.394
because everything you have
is circumstantial.

35:30.461 --> 35:32.964
Well, we'll see about that.
Fine.

35:33.030 --> 35:34.866
Get him to Bellehaven
Psychiatric,

35:34.932 --> 35:37.735
or I will file a 730
with the judge. Thank you.

35:37.802 --> 35:41.305
He knew what he was doing.
He planned those murders!

35:43.574 --> 35:44.942
What?

35:45.009 --> 35:46.177
The hairs we got
from his office,

35:46.244 --> 35:48.246
they don't match either
of our victims.

35:49.647 --> 35:52.350
(groans, chuckles)

35:52.416 --> 35:54.018
(sighs)

35:55.186 --> 35:57.488
Erin, how did it go?

35:57.555 --> 35:58.656
(sighs)

35:58.723 --> 36:01.125
Grand jury refused
to indict.

36:01.192 --> 36:03.728
They didn't see Jennifer
Carpenter as a killer,

36:03.794 --> 36:06.230
they saw her as a victim
who fought back.

36:06.297 --> 36:10.735
And in today's climate,
that's all that matters.

36:10.801 --> 36:12.937
I'm sorry.

36:13.004 --> 36:15.273
You're sorry you won or that
she got away with murder?

36:15.339 --> 36:20.278
If it's any consolation,
I believe her.

36:20.344 --> 36:21.812
I believe he raped her,

36:21.879 --> 36:24.582
and I believe that she
stabbed him in self-defense.

36:24.649 --> 36:26.017
Well, he may have raped her,

36:26.083 --> 36:28.519
but this was cold,
calculated revenge.

36:28.586 --> 36:33.424
She went to that office early
to kill him, and she planned it.

36:33.491 --> 36:35.826
But I can't make a case

36:35.893 --> 36:39.063
based on my gut, so...

36:39.130 --> 36:40.364
you win.

36:42.300 --> 36:45.970
Just for the record,
I don't feel much

36:46.037 --> 36:49.040
like a winner at all these days.

36:50.374 --> 36:51.976
(sighs)

36:54.745 --> 36:56.847
Erin. I've been calling you.

36:56.914 --> 37:01.052
Oh. I was in the grand jury.
I didn't have my phone.

37:01.118 --> 37:03.387
I finally found out where
the murder weapon came from.

37:03.454 --> 37:05.990
Jennifer Carpenter purchased
a hunting knife

37:06.057 --> 37:07.725
the day before the murder.

37:07.792 --> 37:09.994
Even asked if it could
kill a large animal.

37:10.061 --> 37:13.931
Anthony, the grand jury voted
not to indict.

37:15.299 --> 37:17.101
It's too late.

37:18.502 --> 37:19.570
WALKER:
<i>It is written,</i>

37:19.637 --> 37:21.606
"Vengeance is mine.

37:21.672 --> 37:25.810
I will repay the faithless
with everlasting darkness."

37:25.876 --> 37:27.812
You're gonna pay, all right.
Shut your mouth.

37:29.714 --> 37:31.349
Sir, you're gonna hurt yourself.

37:31.415 --> 37:32.683
He'll be fine.

37:32.750 --> 37:34.986
"If your enemies are hungry,
feed them.

37:35.052 --> 37:36.454
"If they're thirsty,

37:36.520 --> 37:38.089
give them a drink."
I'm gonna get security.

37:38.155 --> 37:39.056
Thank you.

37:39.123 --> 37:41.258
All right, knock it off already.

37:41.325 --> 37:42.994
Nobody's buying your crap.

37:45.563 --> 37:47.365
I killed all of them.

37:47.431 --> 37:49.333
I know you killed all of them.

37:49.400 --> 37:50.701
All two of them, Doc.

37:50.768 --> 37:53.137
That's what you think.

37:54.605 --> 37:57.141
How many were there, Doc?
Let's go, Dr. Walker.

37:57.208 --> 37:58.643
Wait a minute,
how many were there?

37:58.709 --> 38:00.311
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

38:00.378 --> 38:01.746
What the hell are you
talking about?
Detective,

38:01.812 --> 38:03.080
let go of him.
Step aside!

38:03.147 --> 38:04.415
WALKER: "How long will
the wicked triumph?"

38:04.482 --> 38:06.150
How many were there, Doc?

38:06.217 --> 38:09.787
We got it from here.
"How long will
the wicked triumph?"

38:16.727 --> 38:18.262
Hello?

38:18.329 --> 38:20.364
FRANK:
Sunroom.

38:20.431 --> 38:22.199
(clears throat)

38:26.470 --> 38:27.905
Uh, where's Henry?

38:27.972 --> 38:32.343
Oh, he's out with the boys
from his days in the 3-5.

38:34.111 --> 38:36.914
Hey, come on, sit down.

38:48.325 --> 38:49.427
This for me?

38:49.493 --> 38:51.529
It is.

38:51.595 --> 38:52.697
Bourbon.

38:52.763 --> 38:55.266
It was your dad's favorite.

38:58.235 --> 38:59.870
(sighs)

39:02.907 --> 39:06.410
Uh, I was unfair to you
the other day,

39:06.477 --> 39:08.245
and I owe you an apology.

39:08.312 --> 39:10.915
Uh, actually,
I picked his brain,

39:10.981 --> 39:12.283
and he shared a lot
of great stuff.

39:12.349 --> 39:14.085
So if anything, I actually
owe you a thanks.

39:14.151 --> 39:17.088
Uh, I don't mean about
the desk assignment.

39:18.456 --> 39:20.324
Oh.

39:20.391 --> 39:23.527
(sighs) Look...

39:25.329 --> 39:29.500
...of course you feel compared
to your father.

39:29.567 --> 39:33.337
We knew him.
You never even met him.

39:33.404 --> 39:34.538
We lost him.

39:34.605 --> 39:39.043
He was never really
yours to lose.

39:39.110 --> 39:41.145
And then we found you.

39:41.212 --> 39:45.783
And I'm sure you felt like
you were kind of being...

39:45.850 --> 39:47.985
X-rayed sometime.

39:48.052 --> 39:51.622
Like we figured some shadow

39:51.689 --> 39:54.658
or shape in you

39:54.725 --> 39:57.595
would bring him back to us

39:57.661 --> 39:59.830
for a moment.

40:02.500 --> 40:05.469
So...

40:05.536 --> 40:07.905
I'm sorry for that.

40:07.972 --> 40:11.108
Not necessary
you put it that way.

40:11.175 --> 40:13.410
Absolutely necessary.

40:13.477 --> 40:15.946
And, uh, I don't apologize
very often,

40:16.013 --> 40:17.414
so enjoy it.

40:17.481 --> 40:20.317
Okay. It is fun.

40:22.286 --> 40:24.221
I, uh...

40:24.288 --> 40:27.925
Look, your dad was
a natural-born leader,

40:27.992 --> 40:30.161
and I think you could be, too.

40:30.227 --> 40:33.798
But it means you have to
set the tone

40:33.864 --> 40:35.199
for those under you,

40:35.266 --> 40:37.635
especially as you rise
in the ranks.

40:37.701 --> 40:40.871
And I just think that...

40:40.938 --> 40:43.841
Well, you could do a better job

40:43.908 --> 40:45.709
of being aware of that.

40:45.776 --> 40:47.611
Fun while it lasted.

40:49.013 --> 40:50.381
(chuckles)

40:50.447 --> 40:51.415
I, uh...

40:51.482 --> 40:54.151
well, I made something for you.

41:10.100 --> 41:11.769
Is that him?

41:11.836 --> 41:13.604
Yeah. And that's my hat.

41:13.671 --> 41:18.008
He would sneak into my closet
and steal it all the time.

41:18.075 --> 41:19.476
JOE: So, what,
he always wanted to be a cop?

41:19.543 --> 41:22.813
FRANK: Kind of,
but I think it started when

41:22.880 --> 41:27.051
he began copying whatever I did.

41:27.117 --> 41:29.920
Greatest feeling in the world.

41:32.456 --> 41:34.758
So he didn't like ties
either, huh?

41:34.825 --> 41:38.262
Hated ties. Suits, too.

41:38.329 --> 41:41.265
That thing was covered
in grass stains

41:41.332 --> 41:42.933
an hour after church.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.269
(laughs)
So he got a scolding,

41:45.336 --> 41:47.271
and you know what,
he just marched right back out

41:47.338 --> 41:48.739
and rolled down the hill again.

41:48.806 --> 41:51.308
All right, so there is
a lesson in here, then?

41:53.077 --> 41:56.580
Not a lesson.
An observation.
