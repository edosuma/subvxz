00:13.833 --> 00:15.833
It's been a while
since we saw you in here.

00:16.083 --> 00:18.375
I was so sorry to hear about your parents.

00:18.875 --> 00:19.708
Yes.

00:22.750 --> 00:24.916
Crispbread and liver patÃ© are coming soon.

00:25.666 --> 00:26.541
Thanks.

01:33.875 --> 01:37.958
He's a foreign quack with no references.
But I had to find someone.

01:38.041 --> 01:41.916
It's Christmas Eve. If we don't assess
her condition today, we're not insured.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.333
We'll talk later, bye.

01:46.416 --> 01:47.625
Nice to meet you.

01:48.041 --> 01:51.000
-Where is the patient?
-She is over there.

01:51.083 --> 01:53.666
We have no name and no address.

01:54.041 --> 01:57.958
I need your signature,
so we can give her medicine.

02:15.875 --> 02:16.916
Where...

02:17.208 --> 02:18.083
Where is she?

02:18.833 --> 02:20.541
When did you last see her?

02:24.541 --> 02:27.125
No! No! Don't touch me.

02:28.375 --> 02:29.916
Don't touch me.

02:32.500 --> 02:35.458
Did you try to hurt yourself?

02:36.208 --> 02:38.291
You can't stop it.

02:40.166 --> 02:41.166
Please.

02:54.041 --> 02:55.041
No...

02:55.125 --> 02:57.166
I'm not insane.

02:59.625 --> 03:01.250
No!

03:01.666 --> 03:02.833
No!

04:59.625 --> 05:02.833
Dr. Halvorson knew
you had to see it for yourself.

05:07.541 --> 05:08.625
Who are you?

05:10.708 --> 05:11.875
My name is Runa.

06:21.625 --> 06:23.625
When did you start working for this cult?

06:23.708 --> 06:25.125
It's not a cult.

06:26.166 --> 06:29.000
I've told you. It's a sanctuary.

06:29.083 --> 06:32.083
People go to sanctuaries
of their own free will.

06:32.166 --> 06:33.916
I'm bringing the girl to her mother.

06:34.666 --> 06:37.166
Better than living
on the street with some idiot.

06:41.208 --> 06:44.791
What do you get then?
I know what my share is, but...

06:44.875 --> 06:47.416
What's the total amount?

06:48.416 --> 06:49.708
It's not about money.

06:50.458 --> 06:52.083
No, no...

06:52.791 --> 06:54.041
It never is...

06:54.583 --> 06:55.625
with cults.

07:49.041 --> 07:50.208
They know something.

10:00.125 --> 10:03.708
Let's wait here
and see if they find her.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.083
There's the boy.

11:44.333 --> 11:46.625
-But that's not the girl.
-It's them.

21:58.625 --> 22:01.041
We need to get her by herself this time.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.625
I always admired you in school, Steinar.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.250
In school and...

22:07.625 --> 22:11.125
Even if you roughed me up,
we were always friends afterwards.

22:13.583 --> 22:14.583
But now...

22:16.291 --> 22:18.791
Now we're outside a house
waiting to kidnap

22:18.875 --> 22:21.041
a sixteen year old girl
who is not even there!

22:22.500 --> 22:24.333
Is anyone forcing you to do this?

22:25.875 --> 22:28.375
-If they've got something on you...
-Shut it, now.

22:29.666 --> 22:30.500
Stop.

22:33.250 --> 22:38.083
-I know it got bad when your parents died.
-You have no idea, Alf.

22:38.166 --> 22:39.458
You have no idea.

22:42.208 --> 22:43.875
I tried to end my life.

22:46.083 --> 22:47.375
You tried to end your life?

22:47.833 --> 22:48.666
Yes.

22:53.041 --> 22:54.541
Why haven't you said anything?

22:56.083 --> 22:59.500
I couldn't talk to someone who knew me.

23:00.541 --> 23:02.750
But there was a man, a doctor.

23:03.416 --> 23:05.583
I don't know how, but he saved me.

23:06.625 --> 23:08.208
He gave me something to live for.

23:08.708 --> 23:09.833
A new family.

23:09.916 --> 23:11.541
We are partners.

23:12.166 --> 23:13.000
Okay.

23:13.541 --> 23:16.125
So why isn't he
on this lunatic stake-out with you?

23:21.041 --> 23:22.041
Why not?

23:23.166 --> 23:25.166
The girl is in there.

23:25.583 --> 23:26.416
Trust me.

23:27.166 --> 23:28.666
I trust my eyes.

23:29.750 --> 23:34.125
And they saw the boy
go in with a pregnant woman.

23:38.125 --> 23:39.166
This is...

26:24.208 --> 26:25.958
But Elena, this is no life.

26:26.458 --> 26:30.333
Don't you want your own home?
New friends? A lover?

26:30.666 --> 26:34.541
-God, I've missed being touched.
-Those things have never brought me peace.

26:36.166 --> 26:39.916
I thought you liked it here.
You've been so committed.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.458
To getting well, yes.
To getting out of here.

26:45.083 --> 26:46.291
Runa has never left.

26:46.375 --> 26:49.833
But Runa is not a patient.
She is a partner.

26:49.916 --> 26:51.500
Sanctum is her life.

26:52.250 --> 26:53.291
It's all she has.

26:54.166 --> 26:56.083
Maybe it is all she wants.

27:00.458 --> 27:01.625
Well, I want more.

27:02.083 --> 27:03.208
And so should you.

28:34.708 --> 28:36.000
Get ready.

28:53.625 --> 28:56.875
Steinar, this is a mistake...

29:46.083 --> 29:47.000
I knew it!

29:51.833 --> 29:54.416
-Steinar!
-Start the van, I've got the girl!

29:54.500 --> 29:58.291
-She's pregnant! You could hurt the baby.
-It's the girl that's important!

30:14.125 --> 30:14.958
Stop!

30:15.041 --> 30:15.958
Stop!

30:24.291 --> 30:25.333
Who the hell are you?

30:32.708 --> 30:34.833
That's enough. Do you hear me?

30:34.916 --> 30:35.916
Enough!

30:46.291 --> 30:47.208
Fuck this shit!

33:44.916 --> 33:45.791
Open the door!

41:10.208 --> 41:11.750
What... are you talking about?

41:11.916 --> 41:12.750
Runa is not well.

41:14.291 --> 41:18.166
It's so obvious.
You have invested everything in this girl.

41:21.750 --> 41:23.500
Don't patronise me.

41:24.416 --> 41:28.750
Ben and I saved you when you were lost.
You had nothing, everything was shit.

41:30.833 --> 41:31.708
You...

41:32.500 --> 41:35.125
You stay the hell away from me.

41:37.250 --> 41:38.208
Fuck!

44:11.250 --> 44:14.958
No, I don't want to...
I don't want to listen. I...

44:22.958 --> 44:24.500
There, there, my love.

44:25.791 --> 44:27.125
Easy does it...

44:30.416 --> 44:31.666
I've got you.

44:32.916 --> 44:34.166
I've got you.

44:38.416 --> 44:39.666
I've got you.

51:39.083 --> 51:41.083
