00:02.020 --> 00:03.860
- How long does it say we've got?
- Five years.

00:03.860 --> 00:06.620
- Bring me the flash drive.
- I haven't got it. Renko took it.
It's gone.

00:06.620 --> 00:07.980
- Will Benedetti?

00:07.980 --> 00:09.780
They're killing everyone who's seen
it.

00:09.780 --> 00:12.260
So if you want to protect yourself,
you need to run the story.

00:12.260 --> 00:15.620
MI5, they take the truth and fold it
into whatever shape they want.

00:15.620 --> 00:17.780
They turn a leak into a conspiracy
theory.

00:17.780 --> 00:20.340
- Have you been watching the news?
The Hard Sun.

00:20.340 --> 00:23.660
- You were right. There'll be more
like this when the news gets out.

00:23.660 --> 00:25.220
- We cut you a deal.

00:25.220 --> 00:28.100
We keep your son out of prison, you
bring us Charlie Hicks.

00:28.100 --> 00:30.820
- There's nothing to suggest that
Hicks killed Butler.

00:32.980 --> 00:34.940
- Daniel? You've got a visitor.

00:34.940 --> 00:36.860

01:30.940 --> 01:32.860
- Hello. I'm Jamie.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.980
I'm here to listen.

01:39.460 --> 01:41.500
What's on your mind?

01:41.500 --> 01:43.500
- Why do you do this...

01:43.500 --> 01:45.260
help strangers?

01:47.300 --> 01:49.780
Do you think your goodness will save
you...

01:51.700 --> 01:53.420
...when the end comes?

01:58.100 --> 02:00.900
Please don't hang up.

02:00.900 --> 02:03.820
- I'm not going anywhere. I'm here.

02:12.460 --> 02:15.060
- So here's how I understand the
deal you've cut.

02:16.940 --> 02:19.900
In exchange for a reduced sentence
and witness protection,

02:19.900 --> 02:23.460
you detail everything you've done
for the Nicholson family.

02:24.820 --> 02:27.580
Three nights ago, you coughed to
killing an Armenian national

02:27.580 --> 02:29.660
by the name of Alan Grigoryan.

02:32.380 --> 02:35.620
Turns out, we didn't even know Mr
Grigoryan was dead.

02:35.620 --> 02:38.740
So, I'm going to need you to explain
that. If you don't mind.

02:38.740 --> 02:40.020
- Sure.

02:40.020 --> 02:43.300
Grigoryan came to London to discuss
a new partnership.

02:44.540 --> 02:46.740
The boss laid a party for him at his
hotel.

02:46.740 --> 02:49.100
- The boss being Terry Nicholson.
- Of course.

02:49.100 --> 02:52.980
Mr Nicholson sends a girl in to
Grigoryan. The best one.

02:54.380 --> 02:57.300
But the guy is an animal. He choked
her.

02:57.300 --> 02:59.820
Says it was a game that went a
little bit too far.

03:00.940 --> 03:04.340
But Mr Nicholson won't allow his
girls to be treated like that.

03:04.340 --> 03:06.540
So he orders me to sanction him.

03:06.540 --> 03:08.820
- So where's Grigoryan's body?

03:08.820 --> 03:10.900
- I put him through...

03:13.140 --> 03:15.260
...hachoir industriel.

03:15.260 --> 03:17.020
- An industrial mincer.

03:17.020 --> 03:20.300
- Yeah. And then after that, I fed
him to the dogs.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.940
- Nice touch.

03:21.940 --> 03:23.300
- Thank you.

03:25.580 --> 03:28.460
- And this is the dead woman? Petra
Andrei?

03:28.460 --> 03:30.180
- That's her.

03:30.180 --> 03:33.420
- Just out of interest, do you know
what happened to Miss Andrei's body?

03:33.420 --> 03:35.820
- It was found, I think.

03:35.820 --> 03:37.780
- It was found in the boot of a car

03:37.780 --> 03:40.300
belonging to a man called Spencer
Coleman.

03:41.740 --> 03:44.140
Who was later found guilty of her
murder.

03:47.900 --> 03:51.180
So, what I'm wondering is how come a
rival of the Nicholson family

03:51.180 --> 03:53.620
is doing time for a murder that
isn't down to him?

03:53.620 --> 03:55.140
- I have no idea.

03:55.140 --> 03:57.260
- Do you know these men?

04:04.060 --> 04:06.860
- I don't know them.
- I think you do.

04:08.340 --> 04:11.420
I think Butler and Hicks were on the
Nicholson family payroll.

04:11.420 --> 04:13.940
I think you called them to sort out
your mess.

04:13.940 --> 04:16.019
I think they moved Petra Andrei's
body

04:16.019 --> 04:18.620
and placed it in the boot of Spencer
Coleman's Jag.

04:20.540 --> 04:22.940
I think Butler and Hicks fitted him
up.

04:25.380 --> 04:28.220
Are you sure there's nothing you
want to tell me, Jean-Paul?

04:29.540 --> 04:31.780
Or are you more afraid of DCI
Hicks...

04:33.700 --> 04:35.900
...than your old firm?

05:24.140 --> 05:26.260
- Oh, come on.

07:32.900 --> 07:35.020
- Will, what do you want?

07:35.020 --> 07:37.860
- Just to talk about it. There's
no-one I can talk to.

07:39.340 --> 07:41.540
- You know I lost my job, right?
- Yeah.

07:44.900 --> 07:47.180
But they've left you alone, right?

07:47.180 --> 07:49.620
- MI5? Yeah, they're not interested
in me

07:49.620 --> 07:51.940
and I've done all the damage I'm
going to.

07:51.940 --> 07:54.900
Still got the conspiracy nut-jobs
crawling all over me though.

07:54.900 --> 07:56.820
I'm basically in hiding from them.

07:59.420 --> 08:01.180
Actually, I'm not...

08:01.180 --> 08:03.580
I'm not dealing with it all that
well.

08:03.580 --> 08:06.740
I'm not dealing very well with
knowing.

08:10.140 --> 08:12.660
What do you think it is? Hard Sun?

08:14.380 --> 08:17.620
- I don't know.
- No, I mean is it a comet, an
asteroid?

08:17.620 --> 08:20.660
Or is it something to do with the
Earth's magnetic field?

08:20.660 --> 08:22.820
- You need to spend less time on the
internet.

08:22.820 --> 08:26.140
- I lost my job and my girlfriend. I
have nothing to do but spend time on
the internet!

08:26.140 --> 08:27.900
- Look, you'll get another job!

08:27.900 --> 08:30.780
- Yeah, and what will be the point
in that, when we know what's coming?

08:30.780 --> 08:34.100
- Will, everyone dies! Cancer,
measles, murder.

08:34.100 --> 08:38.299
Worrying about what's going to
happen in five years, it's just...

08:40.780 --> 08:42.419
- It's what?

08:44.580 --> 08:46.380
- It's narcissistic.

08:48.900 --> 08:50.820
- I'm not thinking about myself.

08:50.820 --> 08:54.220
I'm thinking that in five years,
this is all gone.

08:54.220 --> 08:57.780
Shakespeare and the Sex Pistols and
Mozart.

08:57.780 --> 08:59.580
Twitter. Cary Grant.

08:59.580 --> 09:01.660
The Tellytubbies. It's all gone.

No-one is ever going to sing your
favourite song ever again.

09:05.260 --> 09:07.380
And that doesn't worry you?

09:08.620 --> 09:10.140
- Not unduly.

09:11.300 --> 09:13.380
- Well, if you really believe that,

09:13.380 --> 09:17.060
why not just neck a fistful of pills
or jump off a bridge?

11:14.140 --> 11:16.700
- I'll be there.
- OK.

12:04.420 --> 12:05.860
- Thom!

12:09.820 --> 12:11.260
Welcome!

12:13.180 --> 12:16.500
I thought you were still abroad
working with refugees?

12:19.020 --> 12:20.780
How was it?

12:22.660 --> 12:24.900
- Would you hear my confession,
Dennis?

12:35.700 --> 12:38.500
- Victim's Jamie Unwin. 26.

12:38.500 --> 12:41.460
Junior editor at a trade publishing
house.

12:41.460 --> 12:43.460

- Boyfriend.

12:45.700 --> 12:48.460
Shares a house in Peckham with four
others.

12:48.460 --> 12:50.500
Apparently, he was home all night.

- All right. Time of death?
- Sometime after 3.30am.

12:55.780 --> 12:58.540
- Was she with anyone?
- No, she was alone.

12:58.540 --> 13:00.860
- 26-year-old woman, educated
professional.

13:00.860 --> 13:03.860
She's not out alone at half past
three in the morning.

13:03.860 --> 13:07.180
- We don't have to assume the worst
about people. Not every time.

13:07.180 --> 13:09.340
- I'm not assuming anything about
anyone.

13:09.340 --> 13:11.460
- She was on her way home from
pulling a shift.

13:11.460 --> 13:15.140
- She volunteered on a suicide
helpline.
- Oh, Christ. Seriously?

13:15.140 --> 13:17.380
How does God get up in the morning?

13:17.380 --> 13:20.380
- By not existing. Same as every
other morning.

13:20.380 --> 13:22.220
- Actually, it's worse than it
looks.

13:22.220 --> 13:24.460
Her scooter is still outside the
office.

13:24.460 --> 13:27.180
- The engine had been tampered with.
- What, so it was targeted?

13:27.180 --> 13:30.580
- He marched her half a mile at
knife-point and no-one intervened.

13:32.140 --> 13:35.220
- Yeah, he chose his spot well. This
is a big intersection.

13:35.220 --> 13:38.140
Hundreds of cars passing by, even
early in the morning.

13:38.140 --> 13:40.740

still alive.

- Of course.

- I'm not sure I follow.
- The horror of it.

God commands Abraham to murder his
child.

14:16.020 --> 14:20.820
He commands the slaughter of 3,000
men for worshipping a Golden Calf.

14:20.820 --> 14:24.140
He commands genocide in seven
nations.

Genocide.

- In which He demands the torture
and murder of his own son.

14:33.340 --> 14:36.380
- Thom, I can hear that you're
troubled.

14:37.980 --> 14:39.180
- I saw...

14:40.340 --> 14:43.980
...families floating, face down.

14:45.980 --> 14:47.460
Dozens of them.

a lie?

15:07.420 --> 15:10.860
The God of murdered children and
drowned babies?

15:11.860 --> 15:15.500
- God is the only thing I am certain
of.

15:17.300 --> 15:19.740
It's everything else that's a
mystery.

15:21.940 --> 15:23.820
- I just wanted to know He's there.

15:26.260 --> 15:28.020
Don't you think it's cruel?

15:29.060 --> 15:33.460
To hide Himself from a man cradling
a dead child?

15:34.700 --> 15:39.180
- He only had one son on Earth
without sin, Thom.

15:39.180 --> 15:41.620
But never one without suffering.

15:52.260 --> 15:54.060
- I hurt someone.

- We all hurt people.

- No. I...

...hurt... someone.

That's my confession.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.980
- Who did you hurt?

16:15.420 --> 16:19.060
- She was a young woman. A girl,
really.

16:20.740 --> 16:22.780
I wanted to see what He'd do.

16:25.300 --> 16:27.140
She was so innocent.

16:27.140 --> 16:31.260
So I wiped her from the face of the
Earth.

16:33.100 --> 16:35.220
Just to see what He'd do.

16:36.420 --> 16:38.300
She was so frightened, Dennis.

16:39.820 --> 16:41.620
But He did nothing.

All He had to do was show Himself or
strike me down...

circumstances.

Roland Bell

18:18.660 --> 18:21.060
says a murder investigation has been
launched.

18:22.220 --> 18:25.420
- RADIO:
- This harrowing crime occurred in a
busy area of Central London,

18:25.420 --> 18:28.060
so it's very likely there are
potential witnesses

18:28.060 --> 18:30.340
who might be able to help our
investigation.

18:30.340 --> 18:32.740
We are keen to hear from anyone who
was in the area

18:32.740 --> 18:34.460
between midnight and 7.00am.

18:34.460 --> 18:36.260
- All right, so where are we?

- No reported stalkers, restraining
orders.

She was a junior editor at a trade
publishing house based out in
Vauxhall.

18:42.460 --> 18:44.540
- Oh, yeah? Work on anything I'd
know?

18:45.780 --> 18:48.340
- To be fair, that seems pretty
unlikely.

18:48.340 --> 18:50.220
- Why? I read.

18:50.220 --> 18:52.380
- You CAN read. Different thing.

18:52.380 --> 18:54.900
- All right, all right. Let's just
get to her place of work

18:54.900 --> 18:58.540
and see if she rejected any, I don't
know, obsessive would-be author.

18:58.540 --> 19:01.860
- Officers are on their way.
- All right. Good.

19:02.980 --> 19:05.540
Yeah, we also need to trace whoever
was calling her

19:05.540 --> 19:07.300
at the help centre.

19:07.300 --> 19:09.140
They're careful about anonymity,

19:09.140 --> 19:11.780

paperwork.

- All right, boss.
- Yes, boss.
- All right, let me know.

Excuse me.

- I don't care what you'd like.

20:06.580 --> 20:08.740
Just tell me what happened.

20:12.420 --> 20:15.540
- She told the duty nurse she was
from Social Services.

20:15.540 --> 20:18.500
- And the duty nurse didn't find
that strange?

20:19.980 --> 20:21.820
- Her credentials panned out.

20:41.740 --> 20:43.620
- I need to see him.

21:55.300 --> 21:56.940
Hey, Daniel.

21:58.500 --> 22:00.060
- Hello, Mum.

22:01.620 --> 22:04.660
So, who is she then? That woman.

22:05.780 --> 22:08.460
- Someone who wanted to hurt me by
hurting you.

22:08.460 --> 22:09.900
- Why?

22:11.020 --> 22:12.980
- I don't know, but I'll find out.

22:15.460 --> 22:17.420
I'm pretty good at that.

22:17.420 --> 22:19.020
Finding stuff out.

22:21.540 --> 22:24.300
- What did she say?
- She talked about you.

22:24.300 --> 22:27.460
- Yeah, what about me?
- How I shouldn't trust you.

22:29.220 --> 22:31.620
- Why not?
- Because you're a liar.

22:31.620 --> 22:35.060
- OK. So you need to listen to me
now. She's the liar.

22:35.060 --> 22:36.780
She was lying to you.

22:36.780 --> 22:39.820
- She said, when I was born, you
probably wanted to love me.

22:39.820 --> 22:42.380
But you couldn't cos of how I came
to be.

22:43.700 --> 22:45.780
- And that's...
- That's what?

22:47.180 --> 22:49.140
- Why you hated me.

22:49.140 --> 22:52.340
- Look, that is not true!
- But you did give me away.

22:52.340 --> 22:55.020
- Yeah, but that's not because I
didn't love you.

22:59.540 --> 23:01.300
- Did my dad rape you?

23:04.580 --> 23:06.580
- Daniel...
- Yeah, but did he?

23:12.220 --> 23:13.540
- Yes.

23:14.940 --> 23:18.900
- That's why you couldn't keep me,
you looked at me and you thought of
him?

23:18.900 --> 23:21.780
- All I ever saw was you. You were
my baby.

23:21.780 --> 23:23.780
- Do you know where he is?

23:27.540 --> 23:29.100
- Yeah.

23:29.100 --> 23:30.980
- Yeah.
- So, why not tell me?

23:30.980 --> 23:34.220
- It's not because I'm scared of him
or he means anything to me.

23:34.220 --> 23:35.820
It's not that.

23:37.100 --> 23:40.060
- It's the opposite of that.
- Did he hurt you?

23:42.740 --> 23:44.020
- Yes.

- No, you're... You're not like him.

were ill.

I just... Well, I just noticed you
earlier at the crime scene.

- You did. It's a terrible thing.

26:57.340 --> 27:01.660

it? Hang around murder scenes?

27:01.660 --> 27:03.820
- This is my parish.

27:05.100 --> 27:08.060
I wanted to offer what help I could.

27:09.580 --> 27:11.220

the door.

Yeah, you can see it in their eyes.

me about? Nothing like that?

- No.
- And there's nothing you might want
to tell me?

28:32.460 --> 28:35.140

hearing.

28:39.180 --> 28:42.220

came in?

28:42.220 --> 28:44.620
- A transsexual dominatrix.

28:46.380 --> 28:47.940
- Right.

28:54.340 --> 28:56.300
- May I?
- You may not.

28:59.020 --> 29:00.820

Just tell me where. I'll come alone.

- Mishal, can you see if you can
scare up any link between the victim

29:59.460 --> 30:02.540
and the priest at St Mary of the
Angels on Salcott Road?

30:02.540 --> 30:04.580
Yeah, bloke called Dennis Chapman.

You call me when you know anything,

- All right, boss. What's up?

Listen, I've got to shoot.

Mishal, I need urgent assistance.

31:17.660 --> 31:20.420

trouble.

31:25.380 --> 31:27.060

All right, well, hurry them up.

32:58.660 --> 33:00.340

33:02.700 --> 33:04.300
I'm alone.

33:13.220 --> 33:16.380
- Have you read the story of Job?
- Of course.

33:17.820 --> 33:19.580
- I mean, really read it?

33:21.100 --> 33:25.140
Because when it comes to punishing
the wicked and rewarding the just,

33:25.140 --> 33:28.140
it disagrees with every other book
in the Bible.

33:29.780 --> 33:31.580
Job loses everything.

33:33.420 --> 33:35.580
Not despite the fact that he's a
good man,

judgement," he says.

33:51.420 --> 33:53.180
And at the end of it...

33:54.860 --> 34:00.420
...at the end of this cry of absolute
desolation from God's silence...

34:02.940 --> 34:04.540
...God speaks.

34:05.940 --> 34:10.300
"Where were you when I founded the
Earth?" he says.

34:11.380 --> 34:14.179

together"

34:14.179 --> 34:17.580

joy?"

55:10.300 --> 55:13.020
I tried the son. He knows nothing.

55:15.460 --> 55:18.100
As far as I know, there's no-one
else in her life.

55:18.100 --> 55:20.060
- She saved my life with this.

55:20.060 --> 55:22.300
- That was then, this is now.

55:22.300 --> 55:25.380
If you can find out what she's done
with this file,

55:25.380 --> 55:29.860
then she's not in play, which means
she's not in your life any more.

55:33.780 --> 55:35.380
- And what happens to her?

55:38.740 --> 55:40.180
- Do you care?

55:43.100 --> 55:44.700
Really?

55:49.020 --> 55:51.860
- I need protection for my family.

55:51.860 --> 55:54.900
I want them kept safe for as long as
possible.

55:57.020 --> 55:59.020
- I mean...
- I know what you mean.

56:04.940 --> 56:06.700
- All right, if you can give me
that...

56:10.420 --> 56:12.420
...then I'll give you whatever you
want.

56:30.580 --> 56:32.300
REPORTER:
- Midnight in west London.

56:32.300 --> 56:34.420
As police search for an unknown
killer,

56:34.420 --> 56:38.380
grieving loved ones, family, friends
and a community shocked to its core

56:38.380 --> 56:41.300
have gathered in spontaneous tribute
to Jamie Unwin,

56:41.300 --> 56:44.540
a young woman taken in an act of
inexplicable violence.

56:44.540 --> 56:46.260
Now, just a few hours ago,

56:46.260 --> 56:49.060
an estimated 300 people stood here.

56:49.060 --> 56:51.220
Some singing, some praying...

56:52.940 --> 56:54.780
- Keep filming, or he dies.

56:54.780 --> 56:58.260
The Hard Sun is coming and I am its
messenger.

57:05.060 --> 57:06.900
- No-one's going to be protecting
you.

57:06.900 --> 57:08.780
No-one will be watching you.

57:08.780 --> 57:10.540
You are completely alone.

57:10.540 --> 57:14.940
- If all she's got is enemies, which
enemy can she trust the most?

57:14.940 --> 57:16.780
- What are you doing?

57:16.780 --> 57:18.340
- You will never step away from
this?

57:18.340 --> 57:20.100
- Absolutely not.

57:20.100 --> 57:22.980
- Can you hear him? Because I can.

57:22.980 --> 57:24.660
- Where will you be?

57:24.660 --> 57:26.460
- Probably best you don't know.

57:28.460 --> 57:30.300
- Excuse me, sir, do you have a
second?

57:32.220 --> 57:33.740
- Absolutely.

57:37.020 --> 57:38.540
- It's me.

57:38.540 --> 57:40.380
I've got something for you.
