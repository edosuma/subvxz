00:05.256 --> 00:06.341
Then you don't need me.

00:06.466 --> 00:09.594

- His fault.

We're not family,
we're co-workers.

He's not even
that any more.

00:21.398 --> 00:23.066
I can't believe
you just said that.

Can't come between a man
and his beer money.

00:25.985 --> 00:27.278
See the big
heavy machinery?

00:27.404 --> 00:30.782
I'm sorry, but he should give.
You gave.

00:31.825 --> 00:33.493
Go back to work.

00:35.495 --> 00:38.373
Paolo is the one
who got you off the night shift.

I asked him.

- Morning.
- Don't want to hear it.

02:09.047 --> 02:11.883
So, I take it you
did not ask Cuddy out.

02:12.008 --> 02:12.842
Yeah.

02:12.967 --> 02:14.260
"Yeah" I didn't
or "Yeah" I did?

02:14.385 --> 02:17.514
Whichever one means you almost
had me convinced it was a good idea.

02:17.639 --> 02:18.765
Oh.

02:23.353 --> 02:25.230
- Nothing to say?
- No.

02:25.355 --> 02:27.398
"No" you don't
or "No" you don't don't.

02:27.524 --> 02:28.566
Whichever one means no.

KUTNER: Sixteen-year-old girl

02:49.087 --> 02:51.172
No previous trauma,
lung or cardiac issues.

02:51.297 --> 02:53.550
Gram stain was negative,
no bacteria, no pneumonia.

02:53.675 --> 02:54.592
She's a factory worker,

02:54.717 --> 02:57.720
means she probably works close
to a lot of recent immigrants.

02:58.513 --> 03:01.224
Thank God some of those
offshore sweatshop jobs

03:01.349 --> 03:02.809
are coming back to America.

03:02.934 --> 03:04.769
She's an emancipated minor.

03:04.894 --> 03:06.271
In a factory?

03:06.896 --> 03:09.774
Either an Olympic gymnast
who busted her leg,

03:09.899 --> 03:13.194
a child star who blew
all her sequel money on drugs,

03:13.319 --> 03:14.779
or she's just
a lying runaway.

03:14.904 --> 03:17.490
Her parents died last year.
No relatives.

03:17.615 --> 03:20.577
To avoid foster care,
she got a GED and got emancipated.

03:20.702 --> 03:22.453
Could have picked up
a parasite from a co-worker.

03:22.579 --> 03:25.123
She'd be having GI problems.
Pregnancy's more likely.

Sparks a fluid overload, hits the lungs,
causes the pulmonary edema.

03:28.334 --> 03:30.003
Her history says
she's not sexually active.

03:30.128 --> 03:32.213
And our history says
she could be lying.

03:32.338 --> 03:34.382
But not every teenager
is having sex.

03:34.507 --> 03:36.175
But every teenager
is stupid.

03:36.301 --> 03:38.177
Teenagers on their own
are stupider.

03:38.303 --> 03:40.847
The girl's holding down a job,
makes her rent.

03:40.972 --> 03:43.349
On the one hand,
Kutner's right,

03:43.474 --> 03:47.437
maybe she's a sweet young thing who's
not a screw-up lying through her teeth.

03:47.562 --> 03:50.440
On the two hand,
pregnancy test only takes five minutes,

03:50.565 --> 03:51.983
and we no longer
kill rabbits,

03:52.108 --> 03:55.445
so, in conclusion, shut up,
do the test. What else?

03:55.570 --> 03:56.738
Drugs could
damage the heart.

03:56.863 --> 03:58.907
Pressure imbalance allows fluid
to build up in the lungs.

03:59.032 --> 04:00.074
Tox screen's clean.

04:00.199 --> 04:03.536
For drugs used recently,
not for drugs used before recently.

04:03.661 --> 04:06.497
Sixteen doesn't automatically mean
a risky lifestyle.

04:06.623 --> 04:07.957
HOUSE: Didn't we just
have this conversation?

04:08.082 --> 04:12.921
Kutner trusts her, someone else doesn't.
So, in conclusion, shut up,

04:13.046 --> 04:15.298
check her home and work
for toxins or drugs.

04:15.423 --> 04:17.133
Kutner and Foreman,
do an echo,

04:17.258 --> 04:19.302
find the extent
of the heart damage.

04:27.268 --> 04:29.604
Kutner can do the echo
on his own.

04:29.729 --> 04:32.190
Yes, but he'll be
very lonely,

04:33.608 --> 04:36.778
so I have to ask why.

04:37.904 --> 04:40.198
I've been asked to help
run a clinical trial.

04:41.199 --> 04:42.575
That okay with you?

04:44.077 --> 04:47.872
Good for your career, great for
your street cred. What's in it for me?

04:47.997 --> 04:51.000
You have four doctors
and never more than one case.

04:51.125 --> 04:53.044
Means I have time
to work on other things,

04:53.169 --> 04:56.547
and they all have more chances
to step up, stand on their own.

04:56.673 --> 04:59.759
And if there is
an emergency with Annie,

04:59.884 --> 05:01.886
should she wait
until you finish grooming lab rats?

05:02.011 --> 05:03.388
If there's a problem
with Sophia,

05:03.513 --> 05:05.682
or any other patient,
you know I'll be there.

05:05.807 --> 05:07.433
Your patient is my priority.

05:09.268 --> 05:10.603
No.

05:15.316 --> 05:16.734
What? You want a reason?

05:17.652 --> 05:19.862
Clinical trials take time,
your time is my time.

05:32.041 --> 05:34.335
I told you,
I don't do drugs.

05:34.460 --> 05:36.045
Still a good idea
to check your heart.

05:36.170 --> 05:38.131
Something else
could've damaged it.

05:38.256 --> 05:40.258
You find it hard,
being all on your own?

05:40.383 --> 05:41.968
Having to do
everything without...

05:42.093 --> 05:43.386
Drugs to ease my pain?

05:43.511 --> 05:46.055
- That's not...
- A teenager on her own,

05:46.180 --> 05:47.557
I wouldn't trust me either.

05:47.682 --> 05:49.517
I meant it must be hard.

05:51.561 --> 05:53.479
No one there to back you up.

05:54.147 --> 05:56.941
I know you're trying to be nice,
but I'm not into the whole pity thing.

05:57.066 --> 05:59.444
I was actually doing
the "I get it" thing.

05:59.569 --> 06:02.155
I lost my parents
when I was six.

06:02.572 --> 06:06.826
It doesn't go away, but it gets easier.
You learn to deal.

06:10.621 --> 06:13.708
I still get nervous
when there's a knock on the door.

06:13.833 --> 06:18.379
Always think it's the state trooper
with more bad news.

06:19.047 --> 06:22.717
You already got the worst news
and survived. That's sort of the upside.

06:27.180 --> 06:28.890
Your heart's healthy.

06:29.724 --> 06:31.059
Isn't that good news?

06:31.642 --> 06:35.354
For your heart, yeah, but it also means
we still don't know what's wrong.

06:40.359 --> 06:42.862
Check book balanced,
place spotless,

06:42.987 --> 06:44.739
looks like she builds
her own furniture.

06:44.864 --> 06:46.949
If you're this grown-up at 16,
what happens at 30?

06:47.075 --> 06:49.827
You turn back into a kid,
like Kutner.

06:49.952 --> 06:51.162
Kutner's not that bad.

06:51.287 --> 06:55.500
He needs everything to be nice,
wants to see the best in everyone.

06:55.625 --> 06:58.503
- Kitchen's clear.
- Yeah, friendly is a dangerous thing.

06:58.628 --> 07:00.421
There is such a thing
as too trusting.

07:00.546 --> 07:03.591
Corollary is there's such a thing
as not trusting enough.

07:03.716 --> 07:07.345
Too much, you get hurt.
Not enough, you don't live.

07:07.470 --> 07:11.015
So, the object in life is to get hurt
just the right amount?

07:11.140 --> 07:15.520
Excuse me if I don't go out of my way
to take relationship advice from you.

07:15.645 --> 07:19.440
And trust should be earned.

07:26.322 --> 07:28.116
Bong means nothing,
drugs are irrelevant.

07:28.241 --> 07:29.534
Relevant if
she's taking them.

07:29.659 --> 07:32.662
Even if she is, irrelevant.
Echo showed no heart damage.

07:33.704 --> 07:36.707
Would that be the echo
that Foreman chose not to run with you

07:36.833 --> 07:40.294
after I dashed
his new drug discovery dreams?

07:40.419 --> 07:42.547
You mad at me because you think
Kutner screwed up the echo?

07:42.672 --> 07:43.548
I didn't screw up
the echo.

07:43.673 --> 07:46.259
I know.
No structural heart damage.

07:46.384 --> 07:48.803
- So, if it's not the heart...
- It's the heart.

07:48.928 --> 07:50.263
Didn't you just say
it's not?

07:50.388 --> 07:52.557
Not all heart damage
has to be structural.

07:52.807 --> 07:55.143
Drugs could have caused
intermittent tachycardia.

07:55.268 --> 07:57.436
Irregular heartbeat
would account for the pulmonary edema.

07:57.562 --> 07:59.522
Edema was acute,
vasculitis makes more sense.

07:59.647 --> 08:00.815
There's no sign
in her blood work,

08:00.940 --> 08:03.568
and if she had vasculitis, she'd be
too weak to work in the factory.

08:03.693 --> 08:05.778
She builds her own furniture,
you think she skips work

08:05.903 --> 08:08.948
'cause she's feeling a little weak?
She needs steroids.

08:09.073 --> 08:10.992
Steroids could cause
an irregular heartbeat,

08:11.117 --> 08:13.578
making her current
one irregular-er.

08:14.829 --> 08:16.998
Foreman,
start her on beta-blockers.

08:17.123 --> 08:20.835
Rest of you, do anything that isn't
starting her on beta-blockers.

08:26.007 --> 08:28.843
Start her on the treatment.
Page me if you need me.

08:30.469 --> 08:31.888
(DOOR OPENS)

08:33.472 --> 08:37.268
Irregular heartbeat causes blood to back
up behind the heart and into the lungs.

08:37.393 --> 08:39.228
The beta-blockers keep
this from happening.

08:39.353 --> 08:41.063
I thought the test showed
my heart was fine.

08:41.189 --> 08:43.232
It's tricky.
An arrhythmia can come and go.

08:44.066 --> 08:46.736
So, you don't believe
me or the test.

08:48.487 --> 08:50.489
You guys are more cynical
than I am.

08:51.949 --> 08:54.076
We found the bong
in your apartment.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.162
You went into my apartment?

08:56.287 --> 08:57.830
Extended drug use
can damage...

08:57.955 --> 09:01.209
The bong belongs to my ex.
It's why he's ex.

09:01.334 --> 09:03.336
That doesn't mean
you didn't use it.

09:03.794 --> 09:05.046
No.

09:06.005 --> 09:07.965
You have no reason
to trust me.

09:10.051 --> 09:11.802
You have to do
your treatment.

09:14.805 --> 09:17.975
The other possibility is
you have vasculitis.

09:18.100 --> 09:19.602
The treatment
for that is steroids.

09:19.727 --> 09:21.979
If you've been using drugs,
if they've damaged your heart,

09:22.104 --> 09:25.024
and I start you on steroids,
they could kill you.

09:27.401 --> 09:29.528
I haven't used drugs.

09:32.323 --> 09:33.908
(SIGHS)

09:35.868 --> 09:37.411
I'll get the steroids.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.129
Why are you here?

09:47.255 --> 09:49.382
- I owe clinic hours.
- No, you don't.

09:50.216 --> 09:52.176
I'm here because House
doesn't want me to be here.

09:52.301 --> 09:54.845
I'm guessing he said no
to the clinical trials.

09:54.971 --> 09:57.598
He didn't need to say no,
he just wanted to say no.

09:57.723 --> 10:00.142
House did something solely
out of self-interest?

10:00.268 --> 10:01.644
Freaky.

10:01.769 --> 10:04.105
- Don't suppose you want to override...
- No.

10:05.481 --> 10:07.483
What do you think
this is going to prove?

10:07.608 --> 10:10.444
Does it matter? Just figured
you could use some help down here.

10:10.569 --> 10:13.197
And you spending two hours wiping noses
will annoy House.

10:13.322 --> 10:15.408
If that is your dream,
God bless.

10:15.533 --> 10:19.078
If you want to prove
you can do his job and something more...

10:26.043 --> 10:28.838
His puke is red.
That's blood, right?

10:32.008 --> 10:33.134
That hurt?

10:34.385 --> 10:36.012
How about that?

10:36.137 --> 10:38.973
Four days he's been like this.
It's just getting worse.

10:39.098 --> 10:40.474
Maybe he just needs to poop.

10:40.599 --> 10:42.435
- Evan.
- What?

10:42.560 --> 10:44.562
Worked last time
I had a stomach ache.

10:44.687 --> 10:46.147
That's actually
a smart idea,

10:46.272 --> 10:48.816
which is why that's the first thing
the other doctors checked.

10:48.941 --> 10:50.693
His insides are clear.

10:50.818 --> 10:53.362
- Anyone else sick at day-care?
- No.

10:53.487 --> 10:55.031
- How about his friends?
- No. No one.

10:55.156 --> 10:57.742
- What's happening to him?
- Not sure yet.

10:58.451 --> 11:00.745
Don't worry,
I've got an idea.

11:03.789 --> 11:05.207
You can make
him better, right?

11:06.250 --> 11:07.793
That's my plan.

11:07.918 --> 11:09.503
You need to make him better.

11:15.509 --> 11:16.719
Stay the hell away from me.

11:16.844 --> 11:18.220
NURSE: Just calm down.

11:18.346 --> 11:19.180
What happened?

11:19.305 --> 11:20.848
I adjusted her IV,
and she went crazy.

11:20.973 --> 11:22.350
Don't touch me!
Leave me alone!

11:22.475 --> 11:23.517
Sophia, it's okay,
we're here to help you.

11:23.642 --> 11:24.977
Just stay away from me!

11:25.102 --> 11:26.729
Don't touch me!

11:27.938 --> 11:32.610
I said don't...
Get your hands off of me.

11:32.735 --> 11:33.736
Get your hands...

11:33.861 --> 11:36.113
Beta-blockers don't
cause psychotic breaks.

11:36.739 --> 11:38.574
She's not on beta-blockers.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.460
<i>KUTNER: We started her on
haloperidol, she's stable.</i>

11:49.585 --> 11:52.254
Lab tests show the delirium
wasn't caused by a metabolic problem.

11:52.380 --> 11:53.547
Means we still don't know
what caused it.

11:53.672 --> 11:55.800
Yeah, we do.
Nice job, Foreman.

11:55.925 --> 11:56.967
I didn't switch her meds.

11:57.093 --> 11:59.553
But your decision
to stick it to the man

11:59.678 --> 12:01.889
clearly inspired
Oliver Twist.

12:02.014 --> 12:04.058
I treated her based on
the symptoms she presented.

12:04.183 --> 12:06.352
You treated her based on
empathetic orphan syndrome,

12:06.477 --> 12:08.270
and almost killed her
in the process.

12:08.396 --> 12:11.315
She wasn't on steroids long enough
for it to cause the delirium.

12:11.440 --> 12:13.776
- It's a new symptom.
- One that rules out vasculitis.

12:13.901 --> 12:17.113
And arrhythmia. The psychotic break
caused a surge of adrenaline,

12:17.238 --> 12:20.658
but no irregular heartbeat. Heart's
not the problem. We're both wrong.

12:22.618 --> 12:26.038
So, what causes
lung issues and delirium

12:26.163 --> 12:29.417
and is not based on wishful thinking
that she's safe and happy?

12:30.835 --> 12:32.294
Prinzmetal angina.

12:35.673 --> 12:39.135
Silent and unhappy
is better than vocal and unhelpful.

12:39.677 --> 12:41.137
If you'd run the echo
that you didn't run

12:41.262 --> 12:43.347
before giving her the beta-blockers
that you didn't give her,

12:43.472 --> 12:44.765
if you'd listened to
what Kutner said,

12:44.890 --> 12:45.933
you'd know it's
not a heart problem.

12:46.058 --> 12:48.144
I'm not talking about her heart,
I'm talking about her head.

12:48.269 --> 12:49.520
Prinzmetal angina
doesn't affect...

12:49.645 --> 12:52.731
No reason it couldn't cause
an artery in the brain to spasm.

12:52.857 --> 12:55.192
Leads to the delirium
and the pulmonary edema.

12:59.280 --> 13:02.283
Foreman, give her Ergonovine
to cause vasospasms

13:02.408 --> 13:04.535
and run an fMRI to see
which artery's dancing.

13:04.660 --> 13:06.745
And when I say Foreman,
I mean Foreman.

13:07.371 --> 13:10.166
I want his signature on the paperwork.
I want videotape.

13:10.291 --> 13:13.711
I want photographs of him
with the patient and today's newspaper.

13:15.754 --> 13:17.131
Set her up.
When you're ready...

13:17.256 --> 13:18.466
House wants you...

13:18.591 --> 13:22.428
To do the procedure.
When you get everything set up, page me.

13:32.229 --> 13:35.191
- That's really a camera?
- Pretty cool, huh?

13:35.316 --> 13:37.735
This can go places
the other scopes can't.

13:37.860 --> 13:40.654
Jonah, I need you
to swallow this pill.

13:40.779 --> 13:43.908
- Don't wanna.
- It doesn't hurt, promise.

13:46.243 --> 13:49.497
Jonah, please,
this will help make you better.

13:50.831 --> 13:54.793
I don't want to be mean, but if you
don't do this, we'll have to make you.

13:55.628 --> 14:00.341
It's a power pill. It's not just
a camera, it makes your muscles grow.

14:01.550 --> 14:06.138
Like the vitamins we take, except
this was made with a secret formula.

14:16.941 --> 14:19.818
You did great, sweetheart.
You're very brave.

14:19.944 --> 14:24.949
Jonah's lucky. I was pretty cruel to
my little brother when I was your age.

14:25.074 --> 14:26.617
Why?

14:26.742 --> 14:30.162
I guess I thought it's what big brothers
did. Obviously, I was wrong.

14:31.664 --> 14:33.916
Is he a doctor, too?

14:34.041 --> 14:35.167
No.

14:35.292 --> 14:37.169
(JONAH LAUGHING)

14:38.629 --> 14:40.756
Does the pill tickle,
sweetie?

14:40.881 --> 14:43.926
He can't feel it.
What's funny? Your brother?

14:49.932 --> 14:52.726
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

14:56.897 --> 14:58.857
How are you guys
getting along?

14:59.817 --> 15:01.819
And you suddenly
care why?

15:01.944 --> 15:03.279
House was asking
questions last week.

15:03.404 --> 15:04.446
I assume Foreman
needs us,

15:04.572 --> 15:06.824
and he's worried that if we're sniping,
we might be distracted.

15:06.949 --> 15:09.535
- That's kind of insulting, isn't it?
- Very.

15:09.660 --> 15:11.120
You're obviously fine.

15:13.163 --> 15:15.916
I need a differential
for uncontrollable giggling.

15:16.041 --> 15:18.002
He's four, they laugh.

15:19.086 --> 15:21.797
Yeah, nothing like diarrhea
and bloody vomit

15:21.922 --> 15:23.632
to put you in the mood to goof around.

15:23.757 --> 15:25.384
I've looked down one end
and up the other.

15:25.509 --> 15:28.345
All the tests came back clean.
Can't figure this out.

15:28.470 --> 15:31.890
You can't? Don't you work with
three other doctors and a grouchy gimp?

15:33.892 --> 15:36.020
This isn't House's case.

15:40.899 --> 15:44.403
Just so you know, whatever you're
trying to prove, it won't be enough.

15:44.528 --> 15:45.487
(PAGER BEEPING)

15:46.864 --> 15:47.865
Gotta go.

15:57.708 --> 15:58.584
Sorry.

15:58.709 --> 16:00.502
You didn't miss much.
No spasms yet.

16:00.628 --> 16:03.631
Nothing in the anterior
or posterior cerebral arteries.

16:03.756 --> 16:05.507
<i>SOPHIA: How much longer?</i>

16:05.633 --> 16:07.176
Just a few more minutes.

16:07.301 --> 16:09.887
Were your foster homes all around here,
or did you have to change schools?

16:10.012 --> 16:13.349
Is chatting about lousy foster parents
supposed to relax me?

16:13.474 --> 16:16.018
Left middle cerebral artery
looks good.

16:16.143 --> 16:17.686
My foster parents were great.

16:17.811 --> 16:19.063
I think most foster parents do it

16:19.188 --> 16:20.814
because they want to do
something decent.

16:20.939 --> 16:23.567
Which is why
you didn't get emancipated.

16:23.692 --> 16:27.738
Nothing around the vertebral artery.
No sign of spasms.

16:27.863 --> 16:29.073
But that's odd.

16:30.741 --> 16:32.660
How'd you find out
about your parents?

16:32.785 --> 16:34.787
Told you. State trooper.

16:35.621 --> 16:36.747
Look at that.

16:36.872 --> 16:39.208
Arteries are fine.
You can stop.

16:39.333 --> 16:41.001
Not that.

16:41.126 --> 16:44.755
I forget. Did he come to your house,
or call you down to the station?

16:44.880 --> 16:48.717
Came to my house. I cried
into the guy's shirt for an hour.

16:49.927 --> 16:51.345
Wow.

16:53.347 --> 16:55.724
FMRIs tell us
where the blood flow is.

16:55.849 --> 16:57.351
You were using
your limbic region.

16:57.476 --> 16:59.269
Lights up when we use our imagination,

16:59.395 --> 17:01.480
doesn't light up
when we're telling the truth.

17:02.731 --> 17:04.441
Your parents aren't dead,
are they?

17:06.652 --> 17:08.737
I risked my job,
put you on a different treatment.

17:08.862 --> 17:09.863
I didn't lie
about the drugs.

17:09.988 --> 17:10.906
Then why lie
about your parents?

17:11.031 --> 17:13.826
Because I wish
they were dead.

17:15.202 --> 17:18.080
I got emancipated
because my dad raped me,

17:19.748 --> 17:21.917
and my mom pretended
it didn't happen.

17:30.718 --> 17:32.636
KUTNER: No signs of spasm,
impeded blood flow,

17:32.761 --> 17:35.055
or brain dysfunction.
It's not Prinzmetal's.

17:35.180 --> 17:38.559
All the fMRI showed is House was right.
She was lying.

17:39.226 --> 17:43.230
Only relevant if it could cause
pulmonary edema and delirium.

17:43.355 --> 17:46.024
We find out our patient's been raped,
and that's your response?

17:46.150 --> 17:47.526
Is she a psych patient?

17:47.651 --> 17:49.945
Rape could mean STD.

17:50.070 --> 17:52.948
Thank goodness,
one of you doesn't have a heart.

17:53.991 --> 17:56.744
Maybe if we all stop wringing our hands,
we could solve this thing

17:56.869 --> 17:58.746
and let her live to have
a few more nightmares.

17:58.871 --> 18:02.875
Gonococcal endocarditis would explain
the pulmonary edema, the delirium.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.752
No sign in her blood work.

18:06.378 --> 18:08.088
Could be lying
about the rape.

18:08.839 --> 18:13.469
Yesterday, you were all BFF,
now you think she's pathological.

18:13.594 --> 18:15.053
Yesterday,
I had no reason to doubt her.

18:15.179 --> 18:16.638
If she'd been honest
with us from the beginning...

18:16.764 --> 18:20.267
She lied about dead parents
because it's better than rapist parents.

18:20.392 --> 18:21.643
You find that unsympathetic?

18:21.769 --> 18:22.603
HOUSE: That's it.

18:22.728 --> 18:23.562
What's it?

18:23.687 --> 18:26.523
Her whole life's a mess.
What rhymes with mess?

18:27.399 --> 18:31.445
It's not stress. She has
none of the usual manifestations.

18:31.570 --> 18:33.280
No hormone imbalance,
no cardiac...

18:33.405 --> 18:35.657
Yeah, she's drowning in her own lungs,
and she's delirious.

18:35.783 --> 18:37.367
She's a picture
of emotional health.

18:37.493 --> 18:40.662
Severe emotional stress can lead
to asymmetric function of the mid-brain.

18:40.788 --> 18:42.164
Explains the delirium.

18:42.289 --> 18:45.959
Interruption in the brain-heart coupling
could cause pulmonary edema.

18:46.668 --> 18:49.630
Even if House is wrong, the treatment's
basically anti-anxiety meds.

18:49.755 --> 18:51.632
Hard to argue with.

18:51.757 --> 18:54.468
Yes, I agree,
it does explain everything.

18:55.469 --> 18:59.014
Thirteen, load her up on diazepam.
Foreman, make sure she does it.

18:59.139 --> 19:01.892
Thirteen,
make sure he makes sure.

19:06.772 --> 19:08.649
I went to Cuddy's house.

19:10.067 --> 19:11.860
But I didn't go in.

19:12.444 --> 19:17.324
Went home without ringing
either her metaphorical or actual bell.

19:17.825 --> 19:19.076
Huh.

19:20.494 --> 19:22.454
You're processing.

19:22.579 --> 19:24.206
I'm scrubbing.

19:24.498 --> 19:26.083
"Huh" means processing.

19:26.208 --> 19:28.585
"Huh" means acknowledging.

19:28.710 --> 19:31.839
If you prefer,
I could say "hah" or "hmm" or...

19:31.964 --> 19:34.049
No insights? No opinions?

19:36.260 --> 19:38.345
- You're disappointed.
- You made a decision.

19:38.470 --> 19:40.389
I can't tell you
what's right for you.

19:40.514 --> 19:43.600
Seriously?
Because last week you could.

19:43.725 --> 19:46.228
Last year, you could.
Seems to come pretty easy to you.

19:46.353 --> 19:48.939
Do you want me to tell you
what you should do?

19:49.398 --> 19:50.732
I want you to stop thinking

19:50.858 --> 19:54.236
that acting inscrutable
makes you anything other than annoying.

19:56.989 --> 19:58.448
Interesting.

20:02.494 --> 20:04.872
Holding things in
can give you cancer.

20:06.832 --> 20:08.417
Kid's in day-care,
could be meningitis.

20:08.542 --> 20:10.419
No fever,
no stiffness, no rash.

20:10.544 --> 20:11.587
You check his thyroid?

20:11.712 --> 20:13.922
TSH, T3, T4
were within range.

20:14.047 --> 20:15.257
Ruled out all
the usual suspects.

20:15.382 --> 20:16.592
Nothing's usual
for a 4-year-old.

20:16.717 --> 20:18.844
And as fun as this is,
it feels like we're your goomah.

20:18.969 --> 20:20.387
Your feelings are hurt?

20:20.512 --> 20:22.014
Either you can handle
both these cases or you can't.

20:22.139 --> 20:23.891
If you can't,
it's dangerous and stupid.

20:24.016 --> 20:27.769
On the other hand,
stomach cancer, leiomyosarcoma.

20:27.895 --> 20:31.315
Long shot. Altered mental status
means porphyria's more likely.

20:31.440 --> 20:35.027
No abdominal pain. Cancer explains
the lethargy, the GI symptoms.

20:35.152 --> 20:36.778
Neither is perfect.

20:37.237 --> 20:38.655
Then we test for both.

20:38.780 --> 20:41.491
And by "we" you mean
the collective, not you?

20:42.910 --> 20:44.202
Thanks.

with the rest of the body.

20:50.834 --> 20:52.336
I have a problem
with my brain?

20:52.461 --> 20:56.006
Not exactly. The problem would be
with your body chemistry.

20:56.131 --> 20:57.466
Where's Dr. Kutner?

20:57.591 --> 20:59.676
There's four of us,
it's my turn.

21:02.596 --> 21:04.598
I'm sorry I lied
about my parents.

21:06.183 --> 21:09.061
You did what you thought you had to do
to protect yourself.

21:09.895 --> 21:13.190
If we're right, we should see a change
in your lungs pretty fast.

21:13.315 --> 21:15.901
Then we can figure out
how to manage your stress.

21:16.026 --> 21:20.113
It might help to turn him in,
file a police report. Get closure.

21:20.238 --> 21:21.490
Won't help.

21:22.407 --> 21:25.285
Not addressing what happened
won't make it go away.

21:25.410 --> 21:29.498
Yeah? What do I have to do
to make it go away?

21:30.624 --> 21:32.209
I didn't mean that.
I just mean that you...

21:32.334 --> 21:35.379
I addressed it.
I got away from him.

21:36.338 --> 21:39.841
Reporting it just labels me
"girl raped by dad."

21:39.967 --> 21:41.843
It doesn't have to
define you.

21:41.969 --> 21:43.512
It's how you see me.

21:44.596 --> 21:46.932
It's why you're treating me
with tranquillizers.

21:47.057 --> 21:48.725
Not any more.

21:49.101 --> 21:52.270
Stress wouldn't change
your urine color.

22:00.862 --> 22:03.824
Labs show the brown urine
was caused by shredded red cells.

22:04.866 --> 22:08.203
So, what messes with her lungs,
her mental status,

22:08.328 --> 22:10.497
and runs her blood
through a wood chipper?

22:10.622 --> 22:12.416
Factory lunch rooms
aren't the cleanest places.

22:12.541 --> 22:13.709
Could have
picked up E. coli.

22:13.834 --> 22:15.085
Or Shigella,
from the restroom.

22:15.210 --> 22:17.004
Either would account
for the red cells, the delirium.

22:17.129 --> 22:20.424
But not the original lung symptoms.
Legionnaire's could and cause delirium.

22:20.549 --> 22:21.675
No, her sodium's normal.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.927
What did her furniture
look like?

22:27.806 --> 22:30.600
You said it was homemade.
Old boxes, what?

22:30.726 --> 22:33.020
It was wood,
nailed together.

22:33.145 --> 22:35.522
The wood have
little dents or holes?

22:35.647 --> 22:37.858
I didn't see any on the bookshelves,
but they were painted.

22:37.983 --> 22:41.153
The desk did. Looked like
she'd stapled stuff all over it.

22:41.278 --> 22:43.447
HOUSE: Holes means that
it was pressure treated.

22:43.572 --> 22:44.406

Sawing or burning it releases

22:49.661 --> 22:51.913

22:52.039 --> 22:53.915
Arsenic gets absorbed
in the internal organs

(EXHALES)

24:11.368 --> 24:14.621
Foreman, we're there.

24:24.840 --> 24:28.343
Chelation's complete.
You're arsenic-free.

24:28.468 --> 24:30.262
So, I can get out of here?

24:30.470 --> 24:31.930
In the morning.

24:33.306 --> 24:39.354
That's it? No advice?
No, "Be careful out there, kiddo"?

24:40.730 --> 24:42.482
You want my advice?

24:42.607 --> 24:45.777
Want is one thing,
expect is another.

24:49.489 --> 24:51.741
I wish I could
tell you what to do.

24:52.200 --> 24:56.371
But you're strong. You've made
good choices. You'll be fine.

24:58.165 --> 24:59.416
Thanks.

25:04.254 --> 25:07.007
(MACHINE BEEPING)

25:10.844 --> 25:13.388
Need four milligrams
of Lorazepam.

25:24.065 --> 25:26.067
THIRTEEN: After the seizure,
we ran a new MRI.

25:26.193 --> 25:32.449
This is Sophia's brain three days ago,
this is her brain today.

25:34.659 --> 25:35.744
TAUB: Lesions.

25:35.869 --> 25:38.205
Magical lesions,
which appear out of nowhere.

25:39.956 --> 25:41.917
She was cured,
then she wasn't.

25:42.042 --> 25:43.793
Lesions grew
too fast for cancer.

25:43.919 --> 25:45.545
Could be infection, MRSA.

25:45.670 --> 25:47.756
WBC count would be
through the roof.

25:47.881 --> 25:49.341
Put the arsenic back.

25:49.466 --> 25:51.801
You wanna treat a patient
nearly poisoned to death

25:51.927 --> 25:53.386
by giving her more poison?

25:53.511 --> 25:56.598
Just because we call something a poison
doesn't mean it's bad for you.

25:56.723 --> 25:57.891
It was killing her.

25:58.016 --> 26:01.144
But since she's still dying, the
arsenic, obviously, wasn't killing her.

26:01.269 --> 26:02.270
And since she's now getting worse,

26:02.395 --> 26:05.523
the arsenic was obviously
fighting the killer.

26:05.649 --> 26:09.486
It's a hero.
We should be organizing a parade.

26:10.153 --> 26:12.906
So, what does
arsenic treat?

26:13.031 --> 26:15.742
Syphilis. Before penicillin,
the treatment was arsenic.

26:15.867 --> 26:17.994
We already ruled out STDs,
and even if we were wrong,

26:18.119 --> 26:21.039
that much arsenic in her system
would have wiped out the syphilis.

26:21.164 --> 26:23.833
Acute promyelocytic leukemia
is still treated with arsenic.

26:23.959 --> 26:28.838
APL explains the lesions and why they
appeared after we took the arsenic out.

26:28.964 --> 26:31.258
So, put the arsenic back.

26:31.383 --> 26:34.761
We still have a problem. Arsenic
slows leukemia, but it can't cure it.

26:34.886 --> 26:37.639
If she wants to see 17, she's gonna
need a bone marrow transplant.

26:37.764 --> 26:40.517
The best match would be
a sibling or a parent.

26:40.642 --> 26:45.939
Biopsy a lesion, confirm that she's
dying, and load her up with arsenic.

26:46.189 --> 26:48.108
Keep her alive till
you can convince her that

26:48.233 --> 26:50.735
rapist marrow
and rapist-enabling marrow

26:50.860 --> 26:53.113
work just as well
as the unleaded stuff.

26:56.491 --> 26:58.076
We need to talk.

26:58.994 --> 27:01.454
This about the case
you didn't want me to know about?

27:01.579 --> 27:03.665
- Cuddy?
- Foreman.

27:05.041 --> 27:06.459
You didn't flinch
when you found out about

27:06.584 --> 27:09.838
a 16-year-old who could be
dying in the next few days.

27:09.963 --> 27:13.550
Means you're here about
someone even younger, dying even faster.

27:13.675 --> 27:16.886
- He needs you.
- But he has you.

27:21.975 --> 27:25.061
This boy is going to die.
You selfish enough to let it happen?

27:25.186 --> 27:28.064
- Pot calling a kettle a pot?
- You're a hypocrite.

27:28.189 --> 27:31.484
If our job is to find out what's
killing patients, you'd help this kid.

27:31.609 --> 27:33.403
But you'd rather play mind games
to prove

27:33.528 --> 27:34.988
you're the only one
with magical powers.

27:35.113 --> 27:37.532
You wanted something all your own,
now you got it.

27:39.117 --> 27:40.827
Your disengagement
won't work.

27:40.952 --> 27:42.287
I can see that.

27:42.412 --> 27:43.913
You think that when you tell me
what I should do,

27:44.039 --> 27:45.332
my instincts are
to push back,

27:45.457 --> 27:47.500
so that by not telling me
what you think I should do,

27:47.625 --> 27:49.002
I'll do what
you think I should do.

27:49.127 --> 27:50.337
I sound convoluted.

27:50.462 --> 27:53.256
Disengagement is neither
artful, nor effective.

27:53.381 --> 27:56.968
So, my not doing anything
isn't causing you to do anything.

27:57.093 --> 27:58.470
Right.

27:58.595 --> 28:00.180
I'm okay with that.

28:00.305 --> 28:01.639
No, you're not.

28:01.765 --> 28:05.352
You are designed to have opinions
and to force them on people.

28:05.477 --> 28:08.188
I'm starting to
sound desperate.

28:10.106 --> 28:11.649
Don't screw
with my stuff.

28:16.654 --> 28:19.657
I just need a donor with
the same blood type or something, right?

28:19.783 --> 28:22.619
Actually, bone marrow's
a little more complex.

28:22.744 --> 28:24.996
The best donors
are immediate family.

28:25.955 --> 28:28.792
But those donor banks
have thousands of names.

28:29.667 --> 28:31.086
Your parents' similar DNA

28:31.211 --> 28:33.296
- gives you a much better chance...
- No.

28:34.464 --> 28:35.757
If I do this,

28:37.759 --> 28:39.386
I'll owe my life to them.

28:41.346 --> 28:44.641
It would mean everything else
that happened was somehow okay.

28:45.558 --> 28:47.060
They don't deserve that.

28:48.686 --> 28:50.188
They're not in my life.

28:51.314 --> 28:53.525
If that means I'm dead,
then I'm dead.

28:58.947 --> 29:00.865
I have Huntington's disease.

29:02.909 --> 29:04.119
I'm dying-

29:05.578 --> 29:09.499
I don't know when it will happen,
but it'll be sooner than I ever planned,

29:09.624 --> 29:12.252
and I'd do anything
to stop it.

29:13.086 --> 29:16.047
Because the only way
to make anything right,

29:16.172 --> 29:18.133
the only way
to make your life matter,

29:18.258 --> 29:23.763
is to live as long
and as well as you possibly can.

29:29.436 --> 29:31.604
Have you ever been raped?

29:34.607 --> 29:35.817
No.

29:36.860 --> 29:40.655
Don't try to walk in my shoes,
and I won't try to walk in yours.

29:47.787 --> 29:48.746
You had no right.

29:48.872 --> 29:50.039
To try to convince her
to do the right thing?

29:50.165 --> 29:51.124
To lie to her.

29:51.249 --> 29:52.917
It's a true story.
Who cares if it's not my story?

29:53.042 --> 29:54.878
- It's my life.
- It's her life.

29:55.003 --> 29:57.422
The point wasn't I'm dying,
the point was she should live.

29:57.547 --> 29:58.756
You should have told her.

29:58.882 --> 30:01.676
Instead you tell her to call the cops,
give her stats on DNA markers.

30:01.801 --> 30:05.054
Everything's by the book,
nothing is ever personal.

30:05.180 --> 30:06.764
Trying to sleep here.

30:07.891 --> 30:10.810
Biopsy confirmed APL.
She needs a bone marrow transplant.

30:11.728 --> 30:14.564
Run the donor banks.
I'm going home.

30:15.315 --> 30:17.358
We need to track down
her parents.

30:19.068 --> 30:22.030
I assume she's already
said no to that idea

30:22.155 --> 30:25.116
or there'd be no need to screw up
your courage before saying it.

30:25.241 --> 30:26.784
Children who've been through trauma
can't think clearly.

30:26.910 --> 30:28.786
Children who've been through trauma
and are dying...

30:28.912 --> 30:30.747
Guess I'm the only one
who cares about patient rights.

30:30.872 --> 30:34.375
What she wants could kill her,
what she needs could save her.

30:34.501 --> 30:36.669
Our job is to find out
what's killing patients,

30:36.794 --> 30:38.463
not treat them for chronic idiocy.

30:38.588 --> 30:39.881
Idiocy is
what's killing her.

30:40.006 --> 30:41.758
And since we can't cure that,
I'm going home.

30:41.883 --> 30:45.887
We could save this patient, but all
you care about is getting your answer.

30:48.348 --> 30:50.016
Your point being?

30:51.059 --> 30:54.771
Taub and Kutner can check the donor
banks. I'm gonna find her parents.

30:57.774 --> 30:59.150
Can't see why
you're surprised.

30:59.275 --> 31:00.902
You push against House,
he's going to push back.

31:01.027 --> 31:03.530
Against me, I get,
but his ego's killing my patient.

31:03.655 --> 31:06.241
You liked this case
because he wasn't looming over you,

31:06.366 --> 31:07.450
the decisions were yours.

31:07.575 --> 31:09.827
Only difference now
is he decided not to loom.

31:09.953 --> 31:12.664
Doesn't change the fact
that your patient's dying.

31:13.248 --> 31:15.416
What are we missing?
What's not in the file?

31:15.542 --> 31:18.503
The mother.
Overburdened, at the end of her rope.

31:18.628 --> 31:21.339
Makes her kid sick,
so someone else will take care of him,

31:21.464 --> 31:22.507
sympathize with her.

31:22.632 --> 31:24.092
Munchausen by proxy?

31:24.217 --> 31:27.220
She brought him to the clinic, was with
him when he went into cardiac arrest.

31:27.345 --> 31:29.681
The brother would have noticed,
said something.

31:29.806 --> 31:31.683
Evan's even more protective
than she is.

31:31.808 --> 31:33.643
Then maybe it's the brother.

31:33.768 --> 31:35.645
- He's eight.
- Could be jealous.

31:35.770 --> 31:40.024
He's the opposite of jealous.
He includes Jonah in everything he does.

31:40.149 --> 31:42.819
Makes sure he eats,
brushes his teeth...

31:48.199 --> 31:50.410
You think
we gave him an idea?

31:50.535 --> 31:52.620
Either that
or he's off to kill House.

32:01.087 --> 32:03.798
- Mr. Valez?
- Yeah?

32:03.923 --> 32:06.634
I'm Dr. Remy Hadley
from Princeton-Plainsboro Hospital.

32:06.759 --> 32:10.054
We're treating your daughter,
Sophia, for leukemia

32:10.179 --> 32:14.017
and we need to test both you
and your wife for bone marrow donation.

32:14.142 --> 32:16.269
I'm sorry, you said
you're from Princeton-Plainsboro?

32:16.394 --> 32:19.063
I know this is unexpected,
but time is short and...

32:19.814 --> 32:23.693
What's going on?
This doctor says you have leukemia.

32:25.153 --> 32:26.946
I don't have leukemia.

32:27.071 --> 32:29.949
- Sophia Valez?
- Yeah?

32:31.784 --> 32:35.830
- Sophia Isabel Valez?
- Yeah.

32:36.998 --> 32:38.625
Do you know
something I don't?

32:41.753 --> 32:44.088
Just that liars lie.

32:49.052 --> 32:50.637
You stole her identity.

32:50.762 --> 32:52.764
To protect myself.

32:53.264 --> 32:54.390
So they can't find me.

32:54.515 --> 32:57.644
We can protect you,
but we need to find your parents.

32:57.769 --> 32:58.853
Why?

32:59.729 --> 33:02.357
You have my blood,
you don't need my name to find a donor.

33:02.482 --> 33:05.401
You're a minor, you, obviously,
forged the emancipation papers.

33:05.526 --> 33:10.031
Even if we had a donor, we'd still
need your parents' consent to treat you.

33:10.156 --> 33:13.117
Can't you just pretend
you didn't go to that house,

33:14.327 --> 33:16.537
that you didn't
find that girl?

33:20.833 --> 33:23.878
Calling your parents
doesn't mean a family reunion.

33:25.505 --> 33:28.049
You don't even
have to see them.

33:33.096 --> 33:37.850
When I get sick enough,
it'll be an emergency.

33:38.351 --> 33:42.772
You'll have to give me a transplant,
even without consent.

33:54.450 --> 33:55.702
MELINDA: An iron overdose?

33:55.827 --> 33:57.704
From his vitamins.

33:57.829 --> 33:59.997
If I'm right, we can treat him tonight.

34:00.123 --> 34:02.458
He'll be back to his old self
in the morning.

34:05.878 --> 34:09.757
But they're children's vitamins,
I only give him one.

34:10.258 --> 34:12.009
I know.

34:17.181 --> 34:19.892
I thought more
would make him strong.

34:22.270 --> 34:24.188
I didn't mean
to make him sick.

34:26.107 --> 34:28.067
He's gonna be okay.

34:31.946 --> 34:33.823
He's gonna hate me.

34:35.283 --> 34:38.119
That's the great thing
about brothers.

34:39.662 --> 34:42.081
You can make mistakes,
and they'll still love you.

35:01.726 --> 35:03.936
Donor list turned up
a partial match.

35:04.061 --> 35:04.896
So treat her.

35:05.021 --> 35:06.856
It's only
a three out of six.

35:06.981 --> 35:07.857
So don't treat her.

35:07.982 --> 35:10.902
She may not last the week.
Partial's better than nothing.

35:11.027 --> 35:12.570
- So treat her.
- She'll reject it,

35:12.695 --> 35:15.948
then she'll be too weak to try again
when a better match turns up.

35:16.073 --> 35:18.451
- It's my turn now, right?
- If a better match turns up.

35:18.576 --> 35:21.412
Well, when you decide,
get back to me.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.376
She's scared.

35:28.669 --> 35:30.505
Not scared enough.

35:30.880 --> 35:33.049
Tell her the thing
about emotional reactions is

35:33.174 --> 35:37.011
they're definitionally
irrational or stupid.

35:37.970 --> 35:40.014
You might want to phrase
that in your own words.

35:40.139 --> 35:42.809
She wants to deny her parents
the satisfaction of saving her life.

35:42.934 --> 35:45.770
That's your rational explanation
of her emotional response.

35:45.895 --> 35:47.730
That was her explanation.

35:50.525 --> 35:52.360
That makes sense.

35:52.485 --> 35:53.903
How long did it take her
to come up with that?

35:54.028 --> 35:55.571
It was her
immediate reaction.

35:56.697 --> 35:58.324
That doesn't make sense.

35:58.449 --> 36:00.535
The fact that it makes sense
doesn't make sense?

36:00.660 --> 36:02.578
Emotional is immediate.

36:02.703 --> 36:06.749
She went to rational first,
means there was no emotional to process.

36:06.874 --> 36:09.418
You're saying
she's lying about being raped?

36:09.544 --> 36:10.545
Wouldn't be her first.

36:10.670 --> 36:13.464
She lied about one trauma
to cover a worse trauma.

36:15.550 --> 36:19.637
So, what's worse than rape?

36:26.686 --> 36:28.771
Hi. I'm Dr. House.

36:32.441 --> 36:34.151
What did you do?

36:35.528 --> 36:37.238
- I don't...
- Something happened,

36:37.363 --> 36:38.573
but it wasn't rape.

36:40.366 --> 36:42.410
Believe whatever you want.

36:42.535 --> 36:44.662
You're scared and stubborn,

36:44.787 --> 36:47.707
and you don't like people
feeling sorry for you. Why not?

36:47.832 --> 36:51.586
I don't want pity,
I just want to be normal.

36:52.628 --> 36:54.088
But you know you're not.

36:56.340 --> 36:59.927
You need people to see how independent
you are, how well you're coping,

37:01.721 --> 37:04.307
so they won't see the lost,
hurt little girl.

37:07.768 --> 37:10.021
Because that's
not what you see.

37:11.564 --> 37:14.609
You see someone
who did something terrible,

37:16.360 --> 37:20.531
who deserves to suffer,
who doesn't deserve to live.

37:25.536 --> 37:27.872
What did you do?

37:35.421 --> 37:39.300
Eventually, we'll find your parents,
if only to deliver the body.

37:42.094 --> 37:43.596
And they won't care.

37:43.763 --> 37:45.473
You're an idiot.

37:46.682 --> 37:49.185
You'd rather die
than face your parents because of what?

37:49.310 --> 37:50.770
You broke their Fabergé egg?

37:50.895 --> 37:52.772
I killed their son.

37:56.859 --> 37:58.694
I killed my brother.

38:00.988 --> 38:03.282
I was supposed to watch him.

38:06.619 --> 38:08.663
He was in the bath.

38:12.541 --> 38:14.752
I could hear him laughing.

38:19.006 --> 38:22.134
Every time they'd look at me,
it's like I killed him again.

38:40.236 --> 38:43.406
If you don't take
your parents' bone marrow,

38:43.906 --> 38:46.075
you'll be killing
their other child.

38:47.660 --> 38:49.745
If they don't hate you now,
they will then.

38:53.374 --> 38:54.667
I don't care.

38:55.918 --> 38:57.503
Sure you do.

39:00.798 --> 39:03.426
You want someone to tell you
that it was just an accident,

39:03.551 --> 39:05.011
that it's not that bad.

39:05.136 --> 39:08.014
Well, it is that bad,
and you know it.

39:09.265 --> 39:12.184
There's nothing
you can do to change that,

39:16.230 --> 39:20.526
but there is one thing you can do
to not make it worse.

41:10.553 --> 41:14.306
If you're here to celebrate the kid's
bone marrow transplant working,

41:14.431 --> 41:15.474
you missed cake.

41:15.599 --> 41:18.102
I want to do
clinical trials.

41:18.227 --> 41:20.104
Already had
this conversation.

41:20.229 --> 41:22.606
I've proved I can work
two cases at once.

41:22.731 --> 41:25.359
I can do this,
and I'm doing it.

41:26.777 --> 41:28.154
Okay-

41:28.571 --> 41:31.448
Okay? Just like that?

41:31.574 --> 41:34.785
Can I give my reasons later,
or never?

41:34.910 --> 41:37.163
Three days ago you said no.

41:37.288 --> 41:41.250
Three days ago, you asked me.
Now you told me.

41:42.001 --> 41:44.086
Can't say no
if it's not a question.

41:59.935 --> 42:01.729
(CLEARS THROAT)

42:13.365 --> 42:14.742
Nice thing you did
for Foreman.

42:15.492 --> 42:17.119
He speaks.

42:18.329 --> 42:20.122
He deflects.

42:23.209 --> 42:26.212
I almost cost
a 4-year-old his life.

42:26.337 --> 42:28.756
You knew Foreman
would figure it out.

42:29.256 --> 42:30.966
Did I?

42:35.012 --> 42:37.181
You just needed
to prove it to him.

42:37.306 --> 42:40.226
You're an ass,
but a noble one.

42:40.351 --> 42:42.102
I sound clever.

42:42.228 --> 42:43.395
Thank you.

42:43.520 --> 42:45.689
Your little game
didn't work.

42:45.814 --> 42:48.192
I'm not Foreman,
and you're not me.

42:53.530 --> 42:55.699
You want to talk
about her?

42:56.659 --> 42:58.160
Nope.

42:58.786 --> 43:00.454
All right.

43:03.249 --> 43:05.834
You're gonna be okay,
House.

43:07.503 --> 43:09.171
Good to know.
