00:28.898 --> 00:31.770
Yo, Cy. You ready to watch
some of that good TV?

00:31.814 --> 00:32.771
Oh, yeah.

00:32.815 --> 00:34.164
And you know,

00:34.208 --> 00:35.688
I got some of those
goods snacks, too.

00:38.386 --> 00:39.474
These are for you.

00:40.518 --> 00:42.085
Chocolate covered raisins.

00:42.129 --> 00:44.783
My favorite!

00:46.046 --> 00:47.569
- You want some?
- No, thanks.

00:47.612 --> 00:48.932
I have a hard time
eating raisins.

00:48.961 --> 00:50.876
They always get stuck
in my gears.

00:51.964 --> 00:53.618
So, what are we watching, yo?

00:53.662 --> 00:56.273
For today's screening,
I have chosen a classic tale,

00:56.317 --> 00:58.101
filled with action, comedy

00:58.145 --> 01:00.712
and a serious case
of cat and mouse.

01:00.756 --> 01:03.106
Oh, snaps. You're talking
about <i>Tom and Jerry?</i>

01:04.194 --> 01:05.326
Bingo!

01:29.480 --> 01:32.179
Yeah, boy. I love me
some <i>Tom and Jerry.</i>

01:32.222 --> 01:34.311
And you know
who the best character is...

01:34.355 --> 01:35.530
Uh-huh.

01:35.573 --> 01:37.358
Jerry.
Tom.

01:37.401 --> 01:39.682
What? You shouldn't be rooting
for that no good dirty Tom.

01:39.708 --> 01:42.058
Tom's not dirty.
He's just trying to do his job

01:42.102 --> 01:43.427
getting rid
of that freeloading Jerry.

01:43.451 --> 01:44.756
Jerry ain't no freeloader.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.541
He's just trying to survive, yo.

01:46.584 --> 01:48.847
What are you guys arguing about?

01:48.891 --> 01:50.762
Certainly it must be
the important

01:50.806 --> 01:52.677
if you are doing
all of the shouting.

01:52.721 --> 01:55.071
Cyborg thinks
Tom is better than Jerry.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.333
That's right, he's better.

01:56.377 --> 01:58.205
Tom's got
that strong determination.

01:58.248 --> 01:59.747
Just look at how much
punishment he takes,

01:59.771 --> 02:02.034
and he just keeps coming back
for more.

02:02.078 --> 02:04.733
Yeah, but Jerry is smarter
and faster than Tom.

02:04.776 --> 02:06.909
Just look at him.
Anything Tom tries,

02:06.952 --> 02:09.390
Jerry always gets away.

02:09.433 --> 02:11.348
Now you tell this fool
who's better.

02:11.392 --> 02:13.481
Actually, I think
they're both pretty great.

02:13.524 --> 02:16.484
I do love the sadistic kitty

02:16.527 --> 02:18.877
and the tormenting mouse
as well.

02:18.921 --> 02:21.053
Does it really matter
who's better?

02:21.097 --> 02:24.318
Cartoon rivalries are stupid
and ultimately pointless.

02:24.361 --> 02:26.929
Now, who's ready to T.P.
Titans East?

02:26.972 --> 02:29.105
Oh, I cannot wait
to cover their home

02:29.149 --> 02:30.846
in the paper of the toilets.

02:30.889 --> 02:32.935
That'll shown them that
we're the better titans.

02:32.978 --> 02:34.763
So, are you guys in?

02:34.806 --> 02:38.158
No way. I ain't skinning no car
with this Tom-loving fool.

02:38.201 --> 02:41.073
And I refuse to go anywhere
with this Jerry-obsessed dummy.

02:41.117 --> 02:44.512
Fine. Then you can both
stay here... together.

02:44.555 --> 02:45.991
Wait, you can't leave me alone

02:46.035 --> 02:47.950
with this mouse-loving dum-dum.

02:47.993 --> 02:50.518
Oh, yeah? Well, if I was
a mouse like Jerry,

02:50.561 --> 02:52.084
and yous was a cat like Tom,

02:52.128 --> 02:54.217
you'd never catch me
in a million years.

02:54.261 --> 02:55.871
Are you challenging me, bro?

02:55.914 --> 02:57.046
Maybe I am.

02:57.089 --> 02:58.700
Then challenge accepted.

02:58.743 --> 03:00.049
It's on!

03:50.447 --> 03:52.362
Get away, get away, get away.

05:19.928 --> 05:21.321
Huh?

05:34.986 --> 05:35.986
Ah!

05:47.216 --> 05:48.565
Woah.

06:35.482 --> 06:38.136
Yeah! In your face!

06:38.180 --> 06:39.224
Huh?

07:18.829 --> 07:20.570
Huh? Uh-oh.

07:20.614 --> 07:23.965
Oh! Ah! Oh!

07:24.008 --> 07:25.270
Wait a minute...

07:34.454 --> 07:35.846
Burrito!

07:41.635 --> 07:42.635
What?

08:07.443 --> 08:09.184
What's up with your body?

08:09.227 --> 08:11.162
The toaster must have
shorted out the logic circuits,

08:11.186 --> 08:12.492
and now it's going haywire.

08:16.583 --> 08:17.932
Let's get out of here!

08:47.178 --> 08:48.963
How are we gonna
stop that thing?

08:49.006 --> 08:51.835
There's only one way.
We need to work together.

08:51.879 --> 08:53.576
Now grab that box of raisins.

08:54.708 --> 08:56.057
I thought you hated raisins

08:56.100 --> 08:57.711
'cause they get stuck
in your gears.

08:57.754 --> 08:58.754
Exactly.

09:15.903 --> 09:17.295
Oh, yeah! We did it!

09:22.823 --> 09:23.823
Howdy?

09:26.391 --> 09:28.263
Nice teamwork, bro.

09:28.306 --> 09:30.352
Hey, you just reminded me
of something.

09:30.395 --> 09:31.614
What's that?

09:31.658 --> 09:33.660
The best episodes
of <i>Tom and Jerry</i>

09:33.703 --> 09:35.575
are the ones
when they work together.

09:35.618 --> 09:38.621
Yeah. It's like Tom and Jerry,
both have their strong points,

09:38.665 --> 09:40.231
but they work best as a team,

09:40.275 --> 09:41.624
kind of like us.

09:41.668 --> 09:43.191
Listen, man, I'm sorry

09:43.234 --> 09:44.821
I let a stupid argument
ruin our friendship.

09:44.845 --> 09:46.194
Me too, yo.

09:46.237 --> 09:48.022
So, you wanna go
read some comic books?

09:48.065 --> 09:49.545
I got a new issue of <i>Superman.</i>

09:49.589 --> 09:52.113
No, thanks. I prefer Batman
over Superman.

09:52.156 --> 09:55.072
What? You can't pick Batman
over Superman.

09:55.116 --> 09:56.508
Superman is super strong.

09:56.552 --> 09:58.685
And Batman is super weak.

09:58.728 --> 10:01.818
Well, at least Batman
ain't afraid of no
stupid green rock.

10:01.862 --> 10:03.690
You wanna talk stupid and green?

10:03.733 --> 10:05.039
Let's talk about your face.

10:05.082 --> 10:06.649
You did not just go there.

10:06.693 --> 10:08.303
That is what the God's given me.
