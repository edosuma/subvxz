08:36.385 --> 08:38.126
respect his acting chops
coming off of Kotter,

08:38.169 --> 08:40.520
but he showed some
serious range in that.

08:40.563 --> 08:41.869
What is wrong with you?

08:41.912 --> 08:43.871
Sorry, sorry.

08:43.914 --> 08:45.829
Turns out I am a little drunk.

08:45.873 --> 08:47.527
All right, new rule:

08:47.570 --> 08:48.832
no more beer in the house, ever!

08:48.876 --> 08:50.747
What about...No weed either!

08:50.791 --> 08:51.661
[groaning]

08:51.705 --> 08:53.054
And if he'’s coming over,

08:53.097 --> 08:54.272
I need to know about it
ahead of time!

08:54.316 --> 08:55.622
Why?Because I need to know!

08:55.665 --> 08:57.798
Okay, you'’re way over the line.

08:57.841 --> 08:59.277
Don'’t you tell me
I'’m over the line!

08:59.321 --> 09:00.540
A couple of years ago,

09:00.583 --> 09:02.629
the only lines you knew
went up your nose!

09:05.849 --> 09:07.938
Crazy never takes a day off
here, does it?

09:14.292 --> 09:15.598
So it turns out,

09:15.642 --> 09:17.774
my old boyfriend is
a little less divorced

09:17.818 --> 09:19.820
than I was led to believe.

09:19.863 --> 09:20.951
What does that mean?

09:20.995 --> 09:22.083
He'’s happily married

09:22.126 --> 09:24.215
and his wife
was out of town.

09:24.259 --> 09:25.782
I guess that'’s
the end of that.

09:25.826 --> 09:28.655
Well, that'’s
the obvious move.

09:28.698 --> 09:30.657
I'’ll keep you posted.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.528
Where'’s your mom?

09:32.572 --> 09:33.790
Who cares?

09:33.834 --> 09:34.965
Oh, no, don'’t tell me

09:35.009 --> 09:36.750
you two are bickering.

09:36.793 --> 09:38.534
Back me up here.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.232
Her boyfriend was drinking beer
in front of Roscoe.

09:41.276 --> 09:42.712
That'’s a huge problem, right?

09:42.756 --> 09:44.366
I don'’t think so.

09:44.409 --> 09:45.933
Wow.

09:45.976 --> 09:48.979
Et tu, Marjorie?

09:49.023 --> 09:51.460
Someone wants us to know
they'’re going to college.

09:53.288 --> 09:56.726
Of all people, I thought
you'’d see what I'm up against.

09:56.770 --> 09:59.816
Well, Christy, you have to know
that watching your son

09:59.860 --> 10:01.949
every minute of the day
is not the answer.

10:01.992 --> 10:04.821
I think you'’re wrong.
I think it'’s the perfect answer.

10:04.865 --> 10:07.737
You know when I
was a little girl,

10:07.781 --> 10:09.565
my parents gave
me a baby duck.

10:09.609 --> 10:10.914
I named him Lucky.

10:10.958 --> 10:13.221
This better go
somewhere, Wendy.

10:13.264 --> 10:15.179
Hang on.

10:15.223 --> 10:17.138
I was so afraid
that something would happen

10:17.181 --> 10:19.706
to my little baby duck,
I took him with me everywhere.

10:19.749 --> 10:22.404
Seriously, I'’m a woman
on the edge.

10:22.447 --> 10:25.407
He had a cage in the backyard,
but I was worried

10:25.450 --> 10:28.149
coyotes would eat him,
so I brought him to bed with me.

10:28.192 --> 10:29.672
And?

10:29.716 --> 10:33.676
And... I accidentally rolled
on top of him in my sleep,

10:33.720 --> 10:36.374
and that was it for poor Lucky.

10:36.418 --> 10:39.726
So you'’re saying I could kill
my son by caring about him?

10:39.769 --> 10:42.380
I think she'’s saying,
in her own adorable way...

10:42.424 --> 10:43.730
Thank you.

10:43.773 --> 10:46.994
...that it is possible
to love something too much.

10:47.037 --> 10:49.823
You really think
I need to stop seeing that guy?

10:50.954 --> 10:52.608
Hang on, Jill.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.132
I mean, his wife'’s not back
till Tuesday.

10:57.047 --> 10:58.919
Christy, is there a chance

10:58.962 --> 11:01.704
that you'’re going past mothering
into smothering?

11:01.748 --> 11:03.706
You know, Marjorie,
just because it rhymes

11:03.750 --> 11:05.055
doesn'’t make it good advice.

11:05.099 --> 11:08.798
Oh, I'’ve been wanting
to say that for so long.

11:08.842 --> 11:11.192
You'’re carrying around
so much anger

11:11.235 --> 11:13.411
about your mother,
about your son.

11:13.455 --> 11:15.022
Have you thought
of trying Al-Anon?

11:15.065 --> 11:17.677
I don'’t want to go to Al-Anon.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.679
All those people do
is bitch and moan.

11:24.248 --> 11:25.859
All right, I'’ll say it.

11:25.902 --> 11:27.904
You'’ll fit right in!

11:27.948 --> 11:30.254
I just think it would
help you put your focus

11:30.298 --> 11:32.735
on yourself instead of
the things you can'’t control.

11:32.779 --> 11:34.563
Unbelievable.

11:34.606 --> 11:37.131
I come to you with serious
concerns about my child,

11:37.174 --> 11:39.699
and you give me more meetings
and dead ducks.

11:39.742 --> 11:42.614
It was just one dead duck,
and he had a name!

11:50.013 --> 11:51.145
What?

11:51.188 --> 11:53.103
Nothing.

11:56.106 --> 11:57.891
It'’s just...

11:57.934 --> 11:59.153
[sighs]

12:02.286 --> 12:05.899
When I got sober,
I began to understand

12:05.942 --> 12:08.249
the damage that I'’d done
to my kids while I was drinking.

12:08.292 --> 12:09.729
And it haunts me.

12:09.772 --> 12:11.818
I beat myself up
about it every day.

12:11.861 --> 12:14.951
And so I just wonder
what it must be like for you

12:14.995 --> 12:18.302
to not have any of
those feelings about yourself.

12:18.346 --> 12:20.783
It'’s okay.

12:23.003 --> 12:23.743
[door opens]

12:25.570 --> 12:26.746
Hey, bud.
Hey.

12:26.789 --> 12:28.748
We'’re all done,
but I'’d love to talk

12:28.791 --> 12:30.706
to the two of you
for a few minutes.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.099
Roscoe, you can wait here.

12:32.142 --> 12:33.361
By himself?

12:34.536 --> 12:35.798
Yeah, I saw it.

12:35.842 --> 12:36.930
Please.

12:39.236 --> 12:41.630
So I'’ve talked to
Roscoe a few times now,

12:41.673 --> 12:43.980
and I'’ve also spoken
to some of his teachers,

12:44.024 --> 12:46.853
and I feel confident that
he does not have a drug problem.

12:46.896 --> 12:48.768
Oh, that'’s terrific.

12:48.811 --> 12:50.987
An actual doctor says he
doesn'’t have a problem.

12:51.031 --> 12:53.163
You are an actual
doctor, right?

12:53.207 --> 12:54.382
I am.

12:54.425 --> 12:56.601
I'’m only asking
'’cause in California

12:56.645 --> 12:59.779
any clown can hang a shingle.

12:59.822 --> 13:02.129
What are you basing that on,
what Roscoe says?

13:02.172 --> 13:04.435
He can lie to you
just like he lied to us.

13:04.479 --> 13:08.004
That'’s true, but I've been
doing this a long time.

13:08.048 --> 13:10.659
I'’ve also been sober
for 22 years, and I think that

13:10.702 --> 13:13.880
what we'’re seeing with Roscoe
is typical experimentation.

13:13.923 --> 13:17.840
A 12-year-old smoking pot
hardly seems typical.

13:17.884 --> 13:19.886
It'’s not as unusual
as you might think.

13:19.929 --> 13:20.974
You were 12.

13:21.017 --> 13:22.802
I was 11,
and you'’re not helping.

13:25.413 --> 13:26.936
So, what,
you expect me to go home

13:26.980 --> 13:28.546
and pretend this is no big deal?

13:28.590 --> 13:30.331
I think what
Dr. LaSalle is saying...
Hey!

13:30.374 --> 13:34.074
I'’m not spending $150 an hour
to hear from you.

13:35.902 --> 13:38.165
Can you promise me
that this isn'’t gonna lead

13:38.208 --> 13:39.906
to a bigger problem
down the line?

13:39.949 --> 13:41.951
No, I can'’t.

13:41.995 --> 13:44.693
But I can tell you
that your son'’s trying very hard

13:44.736 --> 13:46.651
to rebuild his trust with you.

13:46.695 --> 13:49.872
Well, it takes a long time
to get my trust back.

13:49.916 --> 13:52.092
I'’m going into
my third decade.

13:54.181 --> 13:56.879
Christy, I know
what you'’re going through.

13:56.923 --> 13:59.969
My husband and I
have teenagers ourselves.

14:00.013 --> 14:01.405
It'’s a scary world,

14:01.449 --> 14:03.799
and you want to protect
them from everything.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.062
But sometimes all you can do
is stay close

14:06.106 --> 14:07.890
and let them find their own way.

14:09.239 --> 14:11.894
Well put.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.156
Hey, while we'’re here,

14:13.200 --> 14:14.810
I'’ve been having

14:14.854 --> 14:17.944
a recurring dream
where I'’m at a...

14:17.987 --> 14:20.207
a big fancy banquet,
and there are a lot of

14:20.250 --> 14:22.862
important people there, but
I can'’t for the life of me

14:22.905 --> 14:25.212
find a place to pee.

14:25.255 --> 14:27.083
What do you think
that means?

14:27.954 --> 14:29.129
Mom! Roscoe.

14:29.172 --> 14:31.740
Oh, sorry, I thought
we were done with him.

14:34.047 --> 14:35.526
Roscoe, wait here.

14:35.570 --> 14:37.528
I'’m gonna talk to your dad
before you go in.

14:37.572 --> 14:39.052
You mean yell at him?

14:39.095 --> 14:41.097
Would you rather I yell at you?

14:41.141 --> 14:42.098
Take your time.

14:45.928 --> 14:47.103
Put those down.

14:47.147 --> 14:49.671
Are you gonna yell at me, too?

14:49.714 --> 14:53.109
No. I think your mom'’s done
enough of that for both of us.

14:53.153 --> 14:55.068
I just want to know
how you'’re doing.

14:55.111 --> 14:56.896
Everybody keeps asking me that.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.114
I'’m fine.

14:58.158 --> 14:59.986
You know what,
that'’s probably true.

15:00.029 --> 15:01.465
I think you are fine.

15:01.509 --> 15:02.553
You do?

15:02.597 --> 15:04.033
Yeah.

15:04.077 --> 15:06.079
Your biggest problem is
you come from a crazy family.

15:06.122 --> 15:07.515
BAXTER:
Oh, for God'’s sakes, Christy!

15:07.558 --> 15:11.519
I'’m not putting a surveillance
camera in his room!

15:11.562 --> 15:15.305
And you have every reason
to be mad at your mom and dad.

15:15.349 --> 15:16.654
And even me.

15:16.698 --> 15:18.961
I am kind of sometimes.

15:19.005 --> 15:20.484
I totally get it.

15:20.528 --> 15:22.922
I spent most of my life
pissed off at the world.

15:22.965 --> 15:25.272
So I got high,
I made bad choices,

15:25.315 --> 15:27.970
and then I got even higher
to forget the bad choices.

15:28.014 --> 15:29.493
Your mom wasn'’t
much different.

15:29.537 --> 15:34.977
She was mad at me,
so she did a lot of dumb things.

15:35.021 --> 15:37.327
Thank God both of us
got our lives together.

15:37.371 --> 15:41.070
BAXTER: Yes, there'’s wine in
the cellar, beer in the fridge,

15:41.114 --> 15:43.943
and thanks to you,
Xanax in the medicine cabinet!

15:47.120 --> 15:50.210
My point is...

15:50.253 --> 15:53.213
the best thing you can do
is take your anger

15:53.256 --> 15:54.910
and turn it into
something positive.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.304
In fact, if you really want
to be a rebel in this family,

15:57.347 --> 15:58.827
don'’t waste your time
getting high,

15:58.870 --> 16:00.655
do well in school
and succeed in life.

16:02.439 --> 16:04.093
I guess I can do that.

16:04.137 --> 16:06.269
And if the goal is just
to piss off your mom,

16:06.313 --> 16:08.445
make a lot of money
and buy Grandma a condo.

16:10.752 --> 16:11.753
BAXTER:
You kicked me!

16:11.796 --> 16:13.668
I can'’t believe
you kicked me!

16:17.846 --> 16:19.369
Maybe everyone'’s mad at me,

16:19.413 --> 16:21.067
but I think
I'’m handling this really well.

16:21.110 --> 16:23.199
Everyone ismad at
you, and you'’re not.

16:23.243 --> 16:24.635
Disagree.

16:24.679 --> 16:26.986
I'’m a mama bear
fiercely protecting her cub.

16:27.029 --> 16:29.118
Yeah, or you'’re a
middle-aged drunk

16:29.162 --> 16:31.381
who'’s projecting her fears
about herself onto her son.

16:31.425 --> 16:33.688
Hey, I'’m not middle-aged
till next March.

16:36.560 --> 16:39.302
Where'’d you come up
with this stuff anyway?

16:39.346 --> 16:41.000
I'’ve been going
to Al-Anon.

16:41.043 --> 16:42.436
Why?

16:42.479 --> 16:45.178
Because I live with an alcoholic
who drives me nuts.

16:47.397 --> 16:49.051
Me?

16:50.922 --> 16:53.447
So, wait, you'’re going
to meetings to deal with me?

16:53.490 --> 16:56.015
I go to meetings to deal
with a lot of stuff.

16:56.058 --> 16:57.190
But, yeah, mostly you.

16:58.626 --> 17:00.193
How long has this been going on?

17:00.236 --> 17:01.455
Not long.

17:01.498 --> 17:03.587
Two years.

17:03.631 --> 17:05.285
Why are we stopping?

17:05.328 --> 17:06.460
'’Cause I'm going to
an Al-Anon meeting.

17:06.502 --> 17:07.461
You want to come?

17:07.503 --> 17:09.070
No, I would not.

17:09.115 --> 17:11.334
Fine.

17:11.377 --> 17:13.205
You'’re not gonna try
to talk me into it?

17:13.249 --> 17:16.035
No. I'’m leaving
that up to you.

17:16.078 --> 17:17.775
'’Cause I can't control
anyone else'’s life,

17:17.819 --> 17:20.169
I can only
control my own.

17:20.213 --> 17:22.171
And, yeah, that can
be really scary,

17:22.214 --> 17:25.435
especially when it'’s your kid
and you love them very much.

17:25.479 --> 17:27.349
And that'’s what I
learned at Al-Anon.

17:27.394 --> 17:29.613
Anyway, I'’ll see
you in an hour.

17:29.657 --> 17:31.572
Try not to
get abducted.

17:31.615 --> 17:33.052
Wait.

17:34.488 --> 17:36.098
Do they have coffee?

17:36.142 --> 17:37.926
Yeah, but I
wouldn'’t drink it.

17:37.969 --> 17:39.928
Fine, I'’ll go.

17:39.971 --> 17:41.625
Great. Oh, just a heads up.

17:41.669 --> 17:44.411
You'’re kind of famous in this
meeting, but not in a good way.

17:44.454 --> 17:45.629
What?!

17:45.673 --> 17:47.544
What did you say about me?!

17:51.635 --> 17:53.202
When I left the house
this morning,

17:53.246 --> 17:55.422
my wife was already
three drinks in.

17:55.465 --> 17:57.293
I know I'’m not
supposed to count,

17:57.337 --> 17:59.165
but I just happened to notice.

17:59.208 --> 18:02.951
And when I was walking out,
she asked me if I would

18:02.994 --> 18:05.345
call in sick for her.

18:05.388 --> 18:06.781
But I didn'’t do it.

18:09.175 --> 18:10.741
You see,
because she'’s not sick.

18:10.785 --> 18:15.485
I mean, she is,
but in a different way.

18:15.529 --> 18:18.053
It used to be that
I would spend the whole day

18:18.097 --> 18:19.185
just worryin'’ about her,

18:19.228 --> 18:23.102
about us and what
was gonna happen.

18:25.234 --> 18:27.976
But I actually wound up
having a good day.

18:28.019 --> 18:31.458
Went to work,
had lunch with some friends,

18:31.501 --> 18:33.982
came here, and...

18:34.025 --> 18:37.246
I'’ll deal with home
when I get there.

18:37.290 --> 18:39.292
Anyway, thanks.

18:41.598 --> 18:43.339
LINDA:
We have time for one more.

18:43.383 --> 18:44.906
Would our newcomer
like to share?

18:49.258 --> 18:53.175
Oh. Okay.

18:53.219 --> 18:56.091
Hi. I'’m Christy and I'm...

18:56.135 --> 18:57.875
What am I here?

18:57.919 --> 18:59.007
You'’re Christy.

18:59.050 --> 19:00.008
That'’s it?

19:00.051 --> 19:01.140
That'’s enough. Go.

19:03.316 --> 19:04.578
Right.

19:04.621 --> 19:06.145
Uh...

19:08.538 --> 19:12.760
I don'’t know
what to say exactly.

19:12.803 --> 19:15.719
I guess what'’s happening
is, uh...

19:17.939 --> 19:20.202
...my 12-year-old son'’s been

19:20.246 --> 19:23.814
smoking pot and drinking beer.

19:23.858 --> 19:25.773
And...

19:29.168 --> 19:30.343
I'’m...

19:32.432 --> 19:35.261
I'’m just really, really scared.

19:39.047 --> 19:41.310
[quietly]: She'’s usually
a lot more annoying.
