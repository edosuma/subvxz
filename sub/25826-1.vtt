He's not my boss, he's my father.

three fucking days.

You are my rock, big man.

[Everest] No, it's not
just another Wednesday.

21:37.297 --> 21:38.840
The noise you're hearing out there,

21:38.924 --> 21:40.717

Yeah, ha, ha, ha. Laugh it up, Frenchie.

22:53.248 --> 22:54.448
But those slum rats out there,

they're slinging Balzalt 500

23:00.797 --> 23:04.259
Aftershave, hair spray, flop sweat.

23:04.593 --> 23:05.753
You're an arms dealer, right?

23:05.802 --> 23:07.722
What's this? You're gonna
give me a superior act?

23:08.472 --> 23:09.681
It's not an act.

23:10.807 --> 23:12.809
I tell you what. I'm a friendly guy.

23:13.560 --> 23:17.481
But don't push my buttons.
Don't you do that.

23:17.814 --> 23:20.692
Please. You're nothing without your toys.

23:21.234 --> 23:23.653
Oh, well, who says I don't have any toys?

23:24.780 --> 23:26.323
But let me ask you something.

23:26.990 --> 23:28.492
What would people like you even be

without people like me?

23:30.077 --> 23:31.620
You don't know what I do.

Well, you're in this place.
You're talking to me.

23:33.747 --> 23:35.749
So, I highly fucking doubt
you're an au pair.

23:36.333 --> 23:37.626
But you know what gets me?

23:38.794 --> 23:40.188
Here you are, you're in my country,

23:40.212 --> 23:41.421
you're doing some lowball job,

23:41.505 --> 23:42.923

23:43.006 --> 23:44.883
- [chuckling]
- Who the fuck are you?

23:45.592 --> 23:48.553
You're a street taco,

You're a housemaid with a handgun.

24:11.409 --> 24:13.729
It's a party for two, so why
don't you skip the fuck along?

You know, I'm trying real hard
to keep myself to myself,

Hey, you want a treat?

Check out the joker at
the Flower Street door.

24:55.996 --> 24:57.076
[Everest] Fuck is he doing?

24:57.122 --> 24:59.183
[The Nurse] I told him I wouldn't hold
a room for his Code Red,

24:59.207 --> 25:01.007
so it looks like he's gonna
seal up the doors.

25:01.042 --> 25:03.882
Guess he's making a big show of the fact
that nobody else is getting in.

Be a major pain in my ass
trying to unseal those tomorrow.

25:14.556 --> 25:15.974
We'll just have to bill his daddy.

25:16.516 --> 25:17.684
He does own the place.

- Yup.

better than him, anyway.

32:10.013 --> 32:12.307
Here. Now, take these.

32:12.390 --> 32:14.118
I'm not on anyone's side,
all right? And you're hurt.

32:14.142 --> 32:16.019
- Here, take that.
- [gunshot]

32:16.102 --> 32:18.313
- Hands up! Right now!
- Hands or we shoot!

32:18.396 --> 32:21.107
- Sarge, we got a cop down!
- What are you doing out here?

32:21.190 --> 32:22.400
[stammers] I live here.

32:22.483 --> 32:24.253
Another fucking vagrant!
Put her in the truck!

32:24.277 --> 32:25.778
No! I gotta take care of her.

32:25.862 --> 32:27.214
[cop] Sarge, how should I proceed?

32:27.238 --> 32:29.574
Cuff her. And if she gives you
any more shit, put her in...

32:30.408 --> 32:31.826
[Everest grunting]

32:38.333 --> 32:39.792
[grunts]

32:39.876 --> 32:41.377
[panting]

32:41.461 --> 32:44.339
[Everest] Respect your elders,
<i>pulis.</i> [grunts]

32:45.381 --> 32:46.674
Nurse, go inside now!

32:46.966 --> 32:48.259
We gotta bring her in.

32:48.343 --> 32:49.218
No!

32:49.302 --> 32:50.529
[man on PA] <i>Remain in your homes.</i>

32:50.553 --> 32:52.013
Oh, damn it, Nurse.

32:52.096 --> 32:53.723
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

32:54.182 --> 32:57.352
<i>Los Angeles is under
ProShield jurisdiction.</i>

32:59.270 --> 33:01.022
[Everest] This is a terrible idea.

33:01.606 --> 33:03.650
[PA announcement continues indistinctly]

33:04.734 --> 33:05.734
[door closes]

33:15.411 --> 33:17.997
These rioters are really
stepping up their game, huh?

33:19.791 --> 33:22.710
- Double tap them to be sure.
- Is that really necessary?

33:23.211 --> 33:25.046
Uh... I don't know.
What do you want to do?

33:25.129 --> 33:27.632
You wanna get into heaven
or you wanna make the Wolfking happy?

33:28.675 --> 33:29.676
All right.

33:30.259 --> 33:32.512
[Franklin's son] Hurry up.
Dad's almost here.

33:54.575 --> 33:55.575
Hmm.

33:56.244 --> 33:58.121
Who says he doesn't have any toys?

34:06.462 --> 34:07.588
Busted.

34:08.547 --> 34:09.590
[chuckles softly]

34:09.674 --> 34:12.176
I can't believe
you got his wallet before me.

34:12.552 --> 34:15.554
Hotel full of criminals.
You gotta move quick.

34:17.348 --> 34:19.434
I did find this in the corridor.

34:19.516 --> 34:20.518
Hey!

34:21.978 --> 34:24.313
I think the old lady likes to drink.

34:24.397 --> 34:25.523
[glasses clink]

34:28.775 --> 34:29.775
[coughs]

34:30.737 --> 34:31.821
So...

34:34.197 --> 34:35.074
How long has it been?

34:35.158 --> 34:37.702
- You know exactly how long.
- Okay. Yeah, I do.

34:37.784 --> 34:39.661
[helicopter whirring in distance]

34:40.746 --> 34:42.915
[Waikiki] Really stacking up
those memberships, huh?

34:42.998 --> 34:44.542
It's been a busy year.

34:45.251 --> 34:46.918
The Dressler, Berlin.

34:47.003 --> 34:49.297
The Floridita, Miami. Hotel Sazerac.

34:49.589 --> 34:51.549
- That's a lot of travel.
- You should try it.

34:51.632 --> 34:53.110
You could have been one of the greats

34:53.134 --> 34:54.761
if you ever got a goddamn passport.

34:54.844 --> 34:56.429
Hey, you know I only work domestic.

34:56.512 --> 34:58.014
Don't make that sound like a choice.

34:58.097 --> 35:02.018
You drew a line...
you knew I couldn't cross.

35:03.478 --> 35:04.562
[sighs]

35:06.439 --> 35:07.815
What's with the implant?

35:08.232 --> 35:11.652
Oh. You noticed? That's sweet.

35:12.069 --> 35:13.488
They're industry standard now.

35:13.821 --> 35:15.323
Wetwork's so fancy.

35:15.406 --> 35:17.575
All I get is a shotgun and a duffel bag.

35:18.075 --> 35:21.704
Well, tonight, I had to look my target
in the eye while I slit his throat,

35:21.788 --> 35:23.664
so the client can watch it later

35:23.748 --> 35:25.333
while he masturbates.

35:26.375 --> 35:29.670
- That's fucking gross.
- That's what happens...

35:29.754 --> 35:31.190
[both] When you only kill
important people.

35:31.214 --> 35:32.507
Yeah, I've heard that before.

35:34.091 --> 35:35.259
And how was your night?

35:36.719 --> 35:38.596
Well... [sighs]

35:39.639 --> 35:40.807
This happened.

35:41.766 --> 35:42.809
[sighs]

35:42.892 --> 35:44.227
Oh, <i>putain,</i> Sherman.

35:44.977 --> 35:47.271
You need to leave here right fucking now.

35:48.272 --> 35:49.315
[speaking indistinctly]

35:49.398 --> 35:51.734
- Let's go.
- Bye, I gotta go.

35:59.909 --> 36:03.287
Oh, man. This thing's on its last legs.

36:03.371 --> 36:04.455
All right.

36:07.750 --> 36:10.086
- [breathing heavily]
- So, you went outside for her?

36:11.254 --> 36:12.296
Yeah.

36:12.547 --> 36:13.548
How long has it been?

36:13.798 --> 36:16.384
Does that make it, like, three years?

36:18.219 --> 36:21.389
A little longer, maybe.
I'm not doing it again.

36:21.764 --> 36:22.765
I just can't.

36:24.183 --> 36:25.434
I can help you.

36:27.728 --> 36:30.231
You do. You do, babe.

36:33.067 --> 36:34.193
[rattling]

36:34.277 --> 36:35.903
Okay, we're home. Let's go.

36:37.989 --> 36:40.575
Careful, careful.
Internal bleeding. Come on.

36:40.658 --> 36:42.910
You know you're risking
everything for this cop?

36:42.994 --> 36:44.662
Yeah, I've got my reasons.

36:45.246 --> 36:47.331
Hey, I broke the rules once before.

36:47.665 --> 36:49.345
It worked out pretty good if you remember.

36:50.668 --> 36:53.671
It was different. I was just a kid.

36:54.005 --> 36:55.399
Yeah, well, so was she when I knew her.

36:55.423 --> 36:56.799
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

36:57.174 --> 36:58.485
[Acapulco] <i>Christ, open your ears,</i>

36:58.509 --> 36:59.677
<i>you ignorant fuck!</i>

37:00.052 --> 37:01.888
[The Nurse] Great. Mr. Acapulco.

37:02.305 --> 37:04.682
All right. Code Red's 18 minutes out.

37:04.765 --> 37:06.601
So get the crash cart
and meet me in my room.

37:06.893 --> 37:08.269
Radio me when the coast is clear.

37:08.352 --> 37:09.352
Yes, Nurse.

37:10.563 --> 37:14.191
I don't care where!
Uh, Cancun. Uh, Guadalajara.

37:14.275 --> 37:16.485
Even fucking Acapulco.
I don't give a shit!

37:16.569 --> 37:18.654
Just make sure there's
a fucking infinity pool.

37:18.738 --> 37:20.948
And don't give me shit about
the price of water, okay?

37:21.032 --> 37:22.533
I know how much fucking water costs.

37:29.540 --> 37:31.250
- [rattling]
- [Waikiki] It's bad, right?

37:31.542 --> 37:32.919
[Nice] You know what this is?

37:33.002 --> 37:34.402
[Waikiki] I know who it belongs to.

37:34.545 --> 37:36.297
- You know what's in it?
- No idea.

37:36.964 --> 37:39.800
Those things are tougher
to crack than a Teikoku vault.

37:41.928 --> 37:43.721
You're a professional. I'm the business.

37:43.804 --> 37:44.804
[rattling]

37:45.348 --> 37:46.974
[scoffs] You know what these are?

37:47.391 --> 37:48.434
Yellow diamonds?

37:48.517 --> 37:51.729
[Nice] Yakutia Canaries.
Worth about 18 million.

37:51.812 --> 37:52.897
Domestic.

37:53.439 --> 37:54.607
Fuck.

37:55.107 --> 37:57.026
Wolfking's probably gonna want those back.

37:59.320 --> 38:00.529
This is no joke.

38:00.613 --> 38:02.132
- You know what he does to thieves.
- Yeah.

38:02.156 --> 38:04.076
You need to walk straight out
the door right now.

38:04.325 --> 38:05.785
I gotta wait till Lev can move.

38:05.868 --> 38:07.495
It is too dangerous for you in here.

38:07.578 --> 38:08.412
You have to trust me.

38:08.496 --> 38:10.998
I do trust you. But he's my brother.

38:12.041 --> 38:14.627
There's so much more
you could have done without him.

38:14.919 --> 38:18.798
You work with what you got,
not what you hoped for.

38:19.674 --> 38:20.967
- Go.
- [pen drops]

38:21.634 --> 38:24.178
You have a lot to live for, out there.

38:25.262 --> 38:26.722
I don't know if that's true.

38:37.817 --> 38:38.817
It is.

38:40.569 --> 38:43.239
Go. Now.

39:02.925 --> 39:04.945
[The Nurse] All right, oxygen.
I need to get a line going.

39:04.969 --> 39:05.803
[machine beeping]

39:05.886 --> 39:08.931
Jesus. They stomped on her
like they were making Merlot.

39:09.306 --> 39:11.434
[Everest] She's a cop in a riot.
What'd you expect?

39:11.517 --> 39:14.020
No, she's a community liaison.

39:14.103 --> 39:15.497
That's what it says. That's her job.

39:15.521 --> 39:16.939
Think that's how she knew about us?

39:17.023 --> 39:17.940
Oh, I don't know.

39:18.024 --> 39:19.483
Maybe she heard something.

39:19.567 --> 39:20.967
Maybe she put two and two together.

39:21.193 --> 39:23.904
You know, I know her from back in the day.

39:23.988 --> 39:25.740
In the day? Before this place?

39:26.157 --> 39:29.076
Yeah. All right. I gotta go in old-school.

39:29.410 --> 39:31.346
I'm gonna need a microwave scalpel,
set to two inches.

39:31.370 --> 39:33.456
- [Everest] Yes, Nurse.
- [whirring]

39:33.539 --> 39:35.666
- Come on. Chop, chop.
- Yes, Nurse!

39:35.916 --> 39:37.960
Great, prep pad. Come on.

39:41.088 --> 39:42.089
[blowing]

39:43.799 --> 39:44.799
[sighs]

39:48.596 --> 39:49.638
[Everest] <i>Nurse?</i>

39:50.431 --> 39:53.726
Nurse? You okay? Do you need to rest?

39:53.809 --> 39:55.019
[breathing heavily] What? No.

39:55.686 --> 39:57.396
Yeah, I'm fine. What I need to do is work.

39:58.147 --> 39:59.940
All right.
You concentrate on that suction.

40:00.024 --> 40:01.609
I'm very fond of this rug.

40:03.736 --> 40:08.157
That's it. There we go. Merlot time.

40:10.242 --> 40:12.828
Yeah, '74 Chevy Nova,
parking lot on Main Street.

40:14.121 --> 40:14.997
Appreciate it.

40:15.081 --> 40:17.083
[automated voice] <i>Patient
regaining consciousness.</i>

40:17.166 --> 40:18.166
[Honolulu gasps]

40:18.793 --> 40:21.712
[Honolulu] Sherm. [groaning]

40:23.422 --> 40:25.633
It hurts so fucking bad, man.

40:25.716 --> 40:27.176
Oh, bro, you're on life support.

40:28.052 --> 40:29.720
Yeah, but we scored, man.

40:30.971 --> 40:32.515
And the stash is safe.

40:33.099 --> 40:36.560
And me and you,
we can go somewhere nice like...

40:36.936 --> 40:38.062
Like that.

40:38.854 --> 40:42.399
Oh, yeah. Drinking daiquiris, man.

40:43.442 --> 40:45.277
Fighting off the hula girls.

40:47.154 --> 40:48.948
Till then, we in the safest place in town.

40:49.031 --> 40:50.950
No, man, daiquiris aren't from Hawaii,

40:51.283 --> 40:52.993
hula girls don't even exist,

40:53.077 --> 40:55.955
and the Artemis isn't safe for us,
all right?

40:56.497 --> 40:57.706
'Cause of this.

40:58.082 --> 40:59.166
A pen?

40:59.250 --> 41:01.043
It's not a pen. It's a goddamn curse.

41:01.127 --> 41:02.294
[scoffs] Okay.

41:02.378 --> 41:03.921
It's a portable vault.

41:04.213 --> 41:07.258
Like the ones that
Malibu mob couriers use, all right?

41:08.008 --> 41:10.594
Exactly like the ones they use.

41:11.262 --> 41:13.305
- Oh, fuck, man.
- That's right.

41:13.389 --> 41:15.391
Fuck! [stammers]
We stole from the Wolfking?

41:15.474 --> 41:16.914
- You did!
- But by accident, though.

41:16.976 --> 41:19.854
That excuse probably won't fly
with the man who runs Los Angeles.

41:19.937 --> 41:21.706
You know what he does to people
who steal from him?

41:21.730 --> 41:23.816
- I do. Yup.
- He has them drowned, man.

41:23.899 --> 41:24.979
Like in an ocean like this.

41:25.025 --> 41:26.402
I don't float, man!

41:26.485 --> 41:28.362
Calm the fuck down, okay?

41:29.155 --> 41:31.115
I called in a favor. Got us a new plan.

41:31.490 --> 41:33.117
An exit strategy.

41:33.200 --> 41:35.619
All we got to do is keep our heads
way down low

41:35.703 --> 41:36.829
until we can move you.

41:37.621 --> 41:38.789
- Hey!
- Hmm.

41:38.873 --> 41:41.000
- Can you do that?
- Yeah. Yeah.

41:42.960 --> 41:44.795
We'll be fine, man.

41:46.380 --> 41:47.380
'Cause you here.

41:47.965 --> 41:49.258
My big brother.

41:50.342 --> 41:51.844
This is the last time.

41:54.305 --> 41:55.305
Yeah.

41:57.391 --> 41:58.392
I'll be right back.

42:00.644 --> 42:02.229
There's something I need to check out.

42:22.750 --> 42:23.977
[Everest] Wolfking's almost here.

42:24.001 --> 42:25.001
All right.

42:25.544 --> 42:27.421
Let's, uh, let's get her talking.

42:27.796 --> 42:31.759
[Everest] Lowering the benzo.
Here she comes.

42:32.551 --> 42:33.677
Mo?

42:34.094 --> 42:36.180
Mo? Hey.

42:37.389 --> 42:40.601
Hey, long time no see, huh?

42:41.685 --> 42:44.188
[groans] Mrs. Thomas.

42:44.271 --> 42:45.981
[chuckles] Yeah.

42:48.734 --> 42:51.320
Your house looks really different.

42:52.738 --> 42:54.198
I don't know, Morgan.

42:54.281 --> 42:55.908
[chuckles weakly]

42:56.867 --> 42:57.867
[chuckling]

42:58.410 --> 43:00.454
Always with the jokes.

43:00.537 --> 43:01.455
Yeah.

43:01.538 --> 43:02.873
You haven't changed.

43:03.749 --> 43:05.584
Well, my hair is longer.

43:06.585 --> 43:08.837
Yeah. It looks nice. I like it.

43:09.546 --> 43:12.549
And I get the shit kicked out
of me more these days.

43:13.676 --> 43:14.802
Yeah, I spotted that.

43:15.886 --> 43:17.179
You know, I thought...

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:09.939

Niagara.

01:09:17.196 --> 01:09:18.572
What is she doing in there?

01:09:19.031 --> 01:09:20.448
Wait, Nice is in there with him?

01:09:20.533 --> 01:09:21.700
He's flatlining.

01:09:22.201 --> 01:09:23.953
[groans]

01:09:24.703 --> 01:09:29.041
Of course. She only kills
important people.

01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:31.377
Wait. You can't. That's against the rules!

01:09:32.294 --> 01:09:36.423
Shit. Everest, get down here now!

01:09:36.631 --> 01:09:38.193
Things are going to hell in a hand basket

01:09:38.216 --> 01:09:39.676
full of blood and shit!

01:09:40.553 --> 01:09:44.223
Fuck! Yeah, the power's out.

01:09:44.305 --> 01:09:45.724
You know what the old man said.

01:09:45.808 --> 01:09:46.808
Yeah, I got it!

01:09:50.479 --> 01:09:52.606
- Okay.
- [beeping]

01:09:59.572 --> 01:10:02.157
Don't look at me. Turn back around.

01:10:03.117 --> 01:10:04.493
[Waikiki breathing shakily]

01:10:04.577 --> 01:10:05.577
What are you doing?

01:10:06.912 --> 01:10:08.539
Lev was on fucking life support

01:10:08.622 --> 01:10:10.182
when you pulled the plug on this place.

01:10:15.754 --> 01:10:17.256
I did not know that.

01:10:18.007 --> 01:10:20.384
You're the business. You knew.

01:10:23.095 --> 01:10:24.095
Ah-ah-ah.

01:10:27.224 --> 01:10:28.224
Okay.

01:10:29.685 --> 01:10:31.854
If you truly believe
you lost him because of me.

The accuracy on these is for shit!

01:10:56.253 --> 01:10:58.547
That's 'cause they're US made, right?
Who sells this crap?

01:10:58.797 --> 01:11:00.257
I'm going to fucking kill you!

01:11:00.341 --> 01:11:02.217
Oh, fuck you! You're not gonna do shit!

I'm sick of you acting superior!

01:11:04.845 --> 01:11:07.514
You are not superior to me!

01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:10.110
You know, I was supposed
to be safe in here.

01:11:10.267 --> 01:11:11.828
That's the fucking deal with this place!

01:11:11.852 --> 01:11:13.228
That's what I fucking paid for!

01:11:13.854 --> 01:11:15.272
But you had to go and fuck that up!

01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:19.735
Well, now I gotta shoot ya.
And I don't want to shoot ya.

01:11:19.818 --> 01:11:22.464
We coulda worked something out.
We had some kind of fucking chemistry.

01:11:22.488 --> 01:11:24.156
But now I gotta fucking shoot you!

01:11:27.952 --> 01:11:29.411
So, who's superior now, bitch?

01:11:29.495 --> 01:11:31.205

My rule number one!

01:12:04.863 --> 01:12:06.115
How many times I gotta say it?

01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:08.283
I'll pay for the damages.

01:12:08.367 --> 01:12:11.203
Are you okay?
You look like all the shades of shit.

01:12:11.286 --> 01:12:13.414
I'm fine. This thing's Kevlar.

01:12:13.789 --> 01:12:15.349
How about the bullet in that waistband?

01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:17.750
Oh, fuck.

01:12:28.053 --> 01:12:29.179
The new owner.

01:12:29.638 --> 01:12:31.724
- We gotta get him out of here.
- [groans] Shit.

01:12:32.182 --> 01:12:33.182
Wait!

01:12:39.815 --> 01:12:40.816
[coughs]

01:12:41.275 --> 01:12:42.109
Pull this thing apart.

01:12:42.192 --> 01:12:43.777
Use anything you can to get inside.

01:12:44.403 --> 01:12:46.655
Go through the floors, through the wall.
I don't care.

01:12:46.989 --> 01:12:49.158
- Just get to my father!
- [man] Two men on the wall!

- [Everest] Hey!
- Where's the girl? Where's Mo?

01:13:01.837 --> 01:13:03.547
She's safe, but we're not.

- We gotta go.
- Come on.

01:13:06.925 --> 01:13:08.111

Let me help you. Please.

01:13:41.585 --> 01:13:43.212
Take good care of her, okay?

01:13:46.799 --> 01:13:48.717

You fix people. I break them.

We can't pick what we're good at

01:14:12.282 --> 01:14:13.450

[Everest] Apparently,
you guys don't know the rules.

01:15:05.294 --> 01:15:07.838
Visiting hours are never.

01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:10.883
What's going on? Where's my father?

01:15:12.467 --> 01:15:13.635

[both grunting]

01:15:53.008 --> 01:15:55.844
In hospitals, we use codes.

01:15:56.595 --> 01:15:59.765
A slow code,
that's when a patient's already dead.

01:16:00.265 --> 01:16:02.643
But, you know, we gotta make a show of it.

01:16:02.976 --> 01:16:04.645
Ease the family into the idea.

01:16:05.312 --> 01:16:06.313
Why are you telling me?

01:16:07.564 --> 01:16:10.734
Because, Junior, you're a slow code.

01:16:11.401 --> 01:16:13.201
See, your homies here,
they don't know it yet,

01:16:14.529 --> 01:16:15.530

Well, people broke the rules.

01:17:24.683 --> 01:17:26.268
No guns, no guests, no bombs.

01:17:26.351 --> 01:17:28.520
No insulting staff,
no killing the other patients.

01:17:28.603 --> 01:17:29.938
And no cops?

01:17:31.356 --> 01:17:32.399
I met your friend.

01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:36.611
She's not my friend. She knew my son.

01:17:38.530 --> 01:17:42.242

- Yeah, I used to.

Don't cross my fucking line.

[indistinct announcement on PA]

01:18:30.457 --> 01:18:32.501
[The Nurse] Put your weight on me.
That's right.

01:18:32.584 --> 01:18:34.294
[Waikiki] Which door we leaving out of?

01:18:34.378 --> 01:18:36.498
[The Nurse] They sealed
all the doors and the tunnels.

01:18:36.755 --> 01:18:37.964
But there's one they missed.

01:18:39.299 --> 01:18:41.099
- [Waikiki] Is this the front?
- That's right.

01:18:41.468 --> 01:18:42.719
You're going out

01:18:42.803 --> 01:18:44.262
the way nobody uses anymore.

01:18:44.888 --> 01:18:46.681
The way I walked in 22 years ago.

01:18:46.765 --> 01:18:48.076
[Waikiki] Wait, hold on. Back up.

01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:50.102
What do you mean, I'm going?

01:18:50.185 --> 01:18:51.185
[Crosby] You!

01:18:52.687 --> 01:18:54.022
You let him die.

01:18:54.898 --> 01:18:58.568
He made me bring him here
and you fucking let him die.

01:18:58.652 --> 01:19:01.071
Okay, just wait. Wait.
Something you need to see.

01:19:01.738 --> 01:19:04.491
- Right here, huh?
- Who the fuck are you?

01:19:04.574 --> 01:19:06.576
[Waikiki] I'm the guy
who stole your diamonds.

01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:09.371
Now, Daddy's dead, okay?

01:19:09.454 --> 01:19:11.123
Your mob's gonna need a new boss.

01:19:11.206 --> 01:19:12.332
Somebody special.

01:19:12.416 --> 01:19:13.542
Somebody who's got

01:19:13.625 --> 01:19:15.669
what all your daddy's
other kids don't. Hmm?

01:19:16.586 --> 01:19:18.922
Six Yakutia Canaries.

01:19:19.464 --> 01:19:20.464
Right?

01:19:23.301 --> 01:19:24.821
Okay, I'll take that deal. You can go.

01:19:25.303 --> 01:19:26.179
Okay.

No, you! You can go! She fucking stays.

01:20:04.968 --> 01:20:05.968
[groaning]

01:20:10.056 --> 01:20:11.516
[choking]

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:13.477
[Waikiki] Whoa. What was that?

01:20:14.186 --> 01:20:16.813
[panting] I told you.
Baby fucking elephants.

01:20:19.649 --> 01:20:20.649
[Waikiki] His men!

01:20:21.568 --> 01:20:23.069
There may be more of them coming.

01:20:23.153 --> 01:20:24.279
We need to get out of here.

01:20:24.696 --> 01:20:27.741
- I can't. I can't do it. No.
- We can do it together.

01:20:27.824 --> 01:20:29.201
Okay. Come on. Come on. Take this.

01:20:29.284 --> 01:20:30.785
Let's go. Come on. Let's go.

01:20:36.416 --> 01:20:37.459
You got keys?

01:20:45.425 --> 01:20:47.928
- You okay?
- I don't know.

01:20:48.386 --> 01:20:51.681
Hey. Getting out is always
tougher than getting in.

01:20:52.265 --> 01:20:53.600
Believe me. I know.

01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:56.728
There you go.

01:21:02.901 --> 01:21:03.901
[clatters]

01:21:06.530 --> 01:21:08.365
[people clamoring in distance]

01:21:30.345 --> 01:21:31.345
Okay.

01:21:45.235 --> 01:21:46.236
[Waikiki] We gotta go.

01:21:49.281 --> 01:21:50.633
[protesters chanting] Free the water!

01:21:50.657 --> 01:21:53.451
Free the water! Free the water!

01:21:57.914 --> 01:21:59.916
[chanting continues]

01:22:19.728 --> 01:22:21.021
Car's right around this bus.

01:22:37.746 --> 01:22:41.249
[grunts] There it is. We're gonna make it.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.168
[groans]

01:22:43.627 --> 01:22:44.753
All right. One second.

01:22:47.088 --> 01:22:48.423
[panting]

01:22:51.885 --> 01:22:52.969
We're good to go.

01:22:54.888 --> 01:22:56.306
[breathing heavily]

01:22:57.641 --> 01:22:58.641
You know what?

01:23:02.187 --> 01:23:05.315
It looks like it's...
It's gonna be a nice morning.

01:23:05.899 --> 01:23:07.525
I think I'm just gonna take a walk.

01:23:07.609 --> 01:23:09.361
No, hey. Hey.

01:23:10.654 --> 01:23:12.155
Tell me you're not going back inside.

01:23:13.031 --> 01:23:15.992
The Artemis? Nah, we're done.

01:23:18.119 --> 01:23:20.789
But, uh, you know...

01:23:22.999 --> 01:23:24.376
if I leave town, who...

01:23:24.876 --> 01:23:26.753
who's going to fix all these people? Huh?

01:23:26.836 --> 01:23:29.214
- Just get in the car. Come on.
- Nah. I'm old.

01:23:31.424 --> 01:23:33.301
Helping people's all I know how to do.

01:23:34.135 --> 01:23:35.136
I'm good with that.

01:23:37.389 --> 01:23:38.389
Which reminds me.

01:23:39.432 --> 01:23:42.811
That last bullet that missed
your mesenteric artery.

01:23:43.186 --> 01:23:44.938
Still gotta get that cleaned and stitched.

01:23:46.815 --> 01:23:49.025
There's a dark room in Vegas.

01:23:49.359 --> 01:23:50.360
It's called The Apache.

01:23:52.195 --> 01:23:53.780
Heading out that way? Huh?

01:23:55.907 --> 01:23:58.118
Honestly, I don't know
where I'm going next.

01:23:59.744 --> 01:24:02.205
First time in my life
I can do whatever I want.

01:24:03.790 --> 01:24:05.083
Never planned for that.

01:24:07.001 --> 01:24:08.002
You'll figure it out.

01:24:11.464 --> 01:24:13.341
Getting out's always tougher
than getting in.

01:24:18.179 --> 01:24:19.179
Go on.

01:24:32.402 --> 01:24:33.778

01:24:42.912 --> 01:24:44.164

01:25:09.814 --> 01:25:11.232
