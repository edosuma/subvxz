<i>Previously on </i>Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...

00:03.086 --> 00:05.046
Oh, my God.
This is everything I've ever wanted.

00:05.130 --> 00:07.382
-Will you...
-Wait!

00:07.465 --> 00:08.842
-...marry...
-Please!

00:08.925 --> 00:10.802
-...me?
-Yes!

00:10.885 --> 00:11.970
No!

00:13.096 --> 00:15.890
I had sex with Tanya.
I promise it will never happen again. You don't live here anymore.

00:18.852 --> 00:21.646
You have been such a great friend.

00:21.730 --> 00:24.899
Like a best friend. You can say it.
Just say it. Please?

00:24.983 --> 00:27.902
This is Nathaniel Plimpton,
the new owner of the firm.

00:27.986 --> 00:29.237
What's that guy's name?

00:29.320 --> 00:30.447
-Glen?
-Gene.

00:30.530 --> 00:34.325
-It's George.
-It's weird how good-looking he is.

00:34.409 --> 00:37.454
You are everything I moved
across country to get away from.

00:37.537 --> 00:40.415
You're the one who put this place on
our radar. It's your fault that I'm here.

00:40.498 --> 00:41.458
Yay for me.

-What was that?

00:54.012 --> 00:57.807
Didn't you read the forecast?
The Santa Ana winds are coming.

00:57.891 --> 01:02.270
The devil winds. Oh, I hate them.
They ruin my eyelash extensions.

01:02.979 --> 01:06.024
I have eyelash-specific alopecia.
You know that.

01:06.107 --> 01:08.735
Karen, we are talking about
something important over here, okay?

01:08.818 --> 01:10.361
Just focus...

01:10.445 --> 01:11.905
...on my ring!

01:12.489 --> 01:15.241
Look at my ring, guys!
[squeals]

01:15.325 --> 01:19.621
I have a ring! A ring! See? See?

01:19.704 --> 01:24.125
See? See?
It's a priceless family heirloom.

01:24.209 --> 01:25.710
He didn't buy you a ring?

01:25.794 --> 01:29.506
Yeah, he did buy it for me. He bought it
back from the pawn shop that I sold it to.

01:29.589 --> 01:32.675
Which is so sweet
'cause he knew how much it meant to me.

01:32.759 --> 01:35.178
I mean, if it meant that much to you,
you probably wouldn't have pawned it--

01:35.261 --> 01:38.348
No. Shh...

01:38.431 --> 01:40.433
Look how good my ring looks
on someone's face.

02:15.176 --> 02:16.845
-why wait, right?
-Exactly!

02:16.928 --> 02:19.472
Maybe because making
a permanent commitment to someone

02:19.556 --> 02:22.016
-is not to be taken lightly?
-Wow, so this is our thing now.

02:22.100 --> 02:25.145
You say insulting things in a calm voice

To be fair, Mrs. H, Josh and Rebecca
have known each other since they were 16,

02:30.150 --> 02:32.360
and they've been through a lot
this last year, so...

02:32.443 --> 02:35.989
Thank you, matron of honor.
See, that's how you read a room.

02:36.072 --> 02:37.657
Don't condescend to me, little girl.

02:37.740 --> 02:39.117
[babbling incoherently]

02:39.200 --> 02:42.078
Listen, guys, I know it seems
like the proposal came very quickly,

02:42.162 --> 02:43.580
but we haven't even set a date yet.

02:43.663 --> 02:47.625
Good for you. I have been engaged
to someone for 12 years.

02:48.585 --> 02:51.629
He's doing a life sentence
in San Quentin, so...

02:51.713 --> 02:53.673
What is going on in here?

02:53.756 --> 02:56.593
Are you guys trying to decide
if a dead spider is a black widow again?

02:56.676 --> 02:59.053
That was a productive Wednesday afternoon.

02:59.137 --> 03:00.138
Hello, Nathan-ay-el.

03:00.221 --> 03:03.057
How are you? What's new with you?
I don't care! I got en-gahged.

03:03.141 --> 03:05.059
Is that why you look halfway decent?

03:05.143 --> 03:09.147
'Cause, usually, you look like
what librarians look like in real life.

03:09.230 --> 03:10.398
[chuckles]
Thank you.

03:10.481 --> 03:12.734
I loved Ms. Patty
and her squishy tummy.

03:12.817 --> 03:14.611
Well, condolences on the engagement.

03:14.694 --> 03:18.156
Shackled to one person
for eternity... So boring.

03:18.907 --> 03:22.744
The pursuit is the fun.
We're hunters by nature.

03:22.827 --> 03:26.205
When I'm chasing a client,
I'm on them 24/7.

03:26.289 --> 03:29.042
Once I sign them, it's like,
"Quit calling me all the time.

03:29.125 --> 03:30.960
Nobody likes a needy whore."

03:34.255 --> 03:35.340
Who wants to talk budgets?

03:39.594 --> 03:43.723
Oh! This must be such a romantic time
for you and Josh.

03:43.806 --> 03:47.602
I bet you're just doing it all the time,
like newly-engaged bunnies.

03:48.269 --> 03:49.896
Yeah, yeah.

03:49.979 --> 03:52.357
-It's kinda hard to walk most days.
-Oh, yeah.

03:52.440 --> 03:55.068
Feels like the carrot's still in the dip,
if you know what I'm saying.

03:55.151 --> 03:56.110
Yeah.

03:56.986 --> 03:59.489
-Ew. But, yeah.
-Yeah, yeah.

03:59.572 --> 04:03.076
So, every time Josh touches you,
it's, like, total goosebumps, right?

04:03.910 --> 04:07.080
Uh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, my God.

04:07.163 --> 04:11.292
He, like, kisses my neck
and it's totally goosebumps city.

04:11.376 --> 04:13.628
Like, my skin looks
like a cold, raw chicken.

04:13.711 --> 04:17.882
Aw! I remember that with Scott,
once upon a time.

04:17.966 --> 04:19.467
Yeah, what's going on with you guys?

04:19.550 --> 04:22.262
You know, I mean,
we're barely talking, and...

04:22.345 --> 04:23.888
we just exchange the children

04:23.972 --> 04:27.558
like political prisoners
at a militarized border, but...

04:28.726 --> 04:33.731
I find myself, sometimes,
looking at old photos of us and...

04:33.815 --> 04:36.651
getting teary and missing him,
like a pathetic loser.

04:36.734 --> 04:38.653
Have you thought about calling him
and telling him that?

04:38.736 --> 04:42.699
No! He cheated on me.

04:42.782 --> 04:46.327
He cheat-- And I, you know--
I have my pride.

04:46.411 --> 04:48.579
I don't want people thinking
I'm a doormat.

04:48.663 --> 04:50.790
-No one would think that.
-[scoffs]

04:50.873 --> 04:53.626
Whatever you decide, whatever happens,

04:53.710 --> 04:56.254
it'll work out great
because you're smart and amazing.

04:56.337 --> 04:58.548
-Oh, thanks, babe.
-Okay?

05:03.511 --> 05:05.638
I, for one, definitely don't think
you're a doormat.

05:05.722 --> 05:08.641
Darryl, have you been eavesdropping again?
Because we talked about that.

05:08.725 --> 05:12.312
I wasn't eavesdropping. I was actually
listening actively from afar.

05:12.895 --> 05:14.314
Because I care!

05:14.397 --> 05:19.986
Look, Paula, I also experienced
a humiliating infidelity.

05:20.653 --> 05:24.991
And I know what it feels like to know
that your spouse's genitals

05:25.074 --> 05:27.410
are taking a little stroll
around the block.

05:27.493 --> 05:32.582
But I can be a good sounding board
for you. I can help you feel better.

05:32.665 --> 05:39.088
No, thanks. You just made me feel worse
and a little nauseous, so...

05:42.341 --> 05:43.593
I can do better.

05:46.846 --> 05:50.183
There must be some sort of light
to get this thing to sparkle. It's duller than Audra Levine's
annual Yom Kippur letter.

05:53.686 --> 05:57.398
The kids are really excited
about us getting married.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.984
Well, they thought I was 17 at first,
so they were shocked.

06:00.068 --> 06:03.154
Becks, I'm really grateful to you

06:03.237 --> 06:05.907
for inspiring me
to volunteer at the church.

06:05.990 --> 06:09.327
You know, you got way more out
of that Scarsdale bar mitzvah than I did.

06:09.410 --> 06:12.997
It made me realize how much
I like all that spiritual stuff.

06:13.081 --> 06:14.457
Like basketball?

06:14.540 --> 06:18.961
-Church basketball at a church.
-Ha-ha. Hilarious. Hey, come here.

06:20.046 --> 06:24.008
Okay, check out this gorgeous
wedding venue in Malibu. Isn't it amazing?

06:39.982 --> 06:42.902

because I will literally drop dead.

06:42.985 --> 06:45.321
Wow, I mean, it's pretty great.

06:45.404 --> 06:48.157
Isn't it? It's so beautiful
and they film movies here...

06:48.241 --> 06:50.910
Really? Wait a minute.

06:50.993 --> 06:54.330

Wine Mixer in <i>Step Brothers,</i> right?

06:54.413 --> 06:55.456
I have no idea.

06:55.540 --> 06:58.835
God, I love that movie. I'm in.
We should totally have our wedding there.

06:58.918 --> 07:02.046
Oh, my God! Um, okay,
let me check the wedding calendar...

07:02.130 --> 07:04.841
-Yeah, come on.
-Oh, no.

07:04.924 --> 07:08.511
They are booked solid
for the next two years.

07:08.594 --> 07:09.720
Oh, bummer.

07:09.804 --> 07:12.765
Well, we both love it
and we're not in a rush, right?

07:12.849 --> 07:15.017
What's two years
when we're gonna be married forever?

07:16.144 --> 07:20.523
Exactly. Perfect. Okay, I will put
our name on the waiting list?

07:20.606 --> 07:22.984
-Great idea.
-Oh, okay. Oh!

07:23.067 --> 07:26.237
You know what? This is... I'm so happy.

07:26.320 --> 07:29.115
Oh, we're crushing this fiancé thing.

07:29.198 --> 07:32.785
And now, we're gonna
be en-gahged for two years.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.668
Huh? No goosebumps?

07:41.669 --> 07:43.171
-What?
-Nothing.

07:43.254 --> 07:46.799
You just said, "Huh?"
and then muttered something?

07:46.883 --> 07:50.011
No, I didn't. Hey, just kiss
this part of my neck.

07:50.094 --> 07:53.681
Just kiss this part of my neck.
Yeah. Okay. Try the clavicle.

07:53.764 --> 07:57.185
-This-- What's--? Okay.
-It's this. It's just anywhere there.

07:57.268 --> 08:00.104

-Is that what you want?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's totally hot.

Lobes? Just go up to the lobes.
Try the lobes.

08:09.780 --> 08:13.451
I'm sorry. I'm in a weird mood today. Um... I apologize. I don't know...
I don't know what's wrong with me.

08:17.288 --> 08:21.876
Wait, don't be sorry.
It's probably just the weather.

08:21.959 --> 08:24.378
-But we don't have weather here.
-We have the Santa Ana winds.

08:24.462 --> 08:27.173
Just like that weatherman said,
they're the worst.

08:27.256 --> 08:31.344
They give me bad allergies,
and people act weird during them, too.

I wanna have sex with you or not.

-What, you think <i>Harry Potter</i> is stupid?

No, I think that when people
say they're Ravenclaw,

they really think that they're Gryffindor,
but they don't wanna sound too braggy.

Okay, wow, so you've seen
one of the movies. Cool?

26:42.642 --> 26:44.269
No, I read all the books.

26:44.352 --> 26:45.603
I had mono in college,

26:45.687 --> 26:48.732
and my weird theater major roommate
had them, and I read them in a week.

You've got something on me.

I've been giving you some space,

It was the biggest mistake of my life.

and had him come here, and then I peed.

Slytherin are proud, cunning, ambitious.

29:10.290 --> 29:11.499
And evil.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.877
Which, actually, totally fits you

even though I'm engaged.

I've missed you, too.

36:03.744 --> 36:06.998
And that toilet upstairs
has been running for three weeks,

36:07.081 --> 36:08.624
and it is driving me insane.

36:08.708 --> 36:12.128
So you are gonna have to put
your hand in that tank ASAP.

36:12.211 --> 36:15.173
Honey, I would put my hand
in an unflushed toilet bowl for you.

36:16.007 --> 36:17.008
Yeah, you will.

36:28.060 --> 36:29.770
Don't yell at me again, please.

36:29.854 --> 36:33.482
Darryl, I'm here to apologize.

36:33.566 --> 36:37.862
-I know, I know. I am so sorry.
-No, I'm the one who...

36:38.779 --> 36:40.198
Just...

36:42.366 --> 36:43.492
-Darryl...
-Hm?

36:43.576 --> 36:50.124
Thanks to your unsolicited
and presumptuous interference,

36:50.208 --> 36:53.544
Scott and I are going to try
and work things out.

36:53.628 --> 36:57.423
-Oh, God, that's great!
-But you definitely overstepped.

36:58.799 --> 37:00.509
[sighs]
But I know you meant well.

37:00.593 --> 37:03.971
Of course, I did, because I care.
You're my best friend.

37:04.055 --> 37:08.684
I know, I know. I'm not your best friend.
Please, just don't say it.

37:08.768 --> 37:12.480
'Cause I think I've always known it.
But the truth is...

37:13.814 --> 37:16.901
I don't really care
'cause you make me happy.

37:16.984 --> 37:18.694
-I do?
-Yes.

37:18.778 --> 37:22.573
Every day when I come to work,
you have the perfect sarcastic remark,

37:22.657 --> 37:24.825
or a great insight into a case,

37:24.909 --> 37:26.953
and you always tell me the truth,
no matter what.

37:27.036 --> 37:30.498
And I like those things so much
that I don't care where I rank with you.

37:31.332 --> 37:34.293
-But--
-No, no. Let me finish.

Okay, so we need to clear the air. Um...

Last week...

39:34.455 --> 39:35.873

39:36.665 --> 39:41.045

and it's never gonna happen again.

Whatever you say.

39:44.340 --> 39:49.845
I do say. 'Cause I just-- I said it. Yeah.
And I actually have marvelous news.

40:15.329 --> 40:17.706
-Do you know my name?
-Of course, I do.

40:17.790 --> 40:20.209
You finally made an impression
with that elevator thing.

40:20.292 --> 40:24.588
I asked around, and no one seemed to know
your name either, so then I looked you up.

40:25.881 --> 40:27.800
Wow, that's thoughtful.

40:29.218 --> 40:33.305
And I am sorry, by the way,
about all the-- I was triggered.

Also, those came in.

And then, I was--
I was worried you might be upset.
