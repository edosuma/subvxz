00:10.377 --> 00:12.889
Something kills people here.

00:12.891 --> 00:15.861
Lots of pain.

00:15.863 --> 00:18.466
This isn't normal.
There's something going on.

00:18.468 --> 00:21.805
Really strong.

00:21.807 --> 00:24.581
Something's grabbing my arm and hurting me.

00:24.583 --> 00:26.253
And then, she's screaming.

00:28.592 --> 00:30.762
He was classified as insane.

00:31.666 --> 00:33.637
This is not good.

00:33.639 --> 00:36.042
They're being tortured.

00:36.044 --> 00:38.715
Something bad's going to happen.

00:38.717 --> 00:41.621
My name is Amy Allan.

00:41.623 --> 00:42.990
There's panic.

00:42.992 --> 00:44.425
And it's almost like a butchering.

00:44.427 --> 00:45.495
I see dead people.

00:45.497 --> 00:47.633
They all died horribly.

00:47.635 --> 00:49.337
I speak to dead people.

00:49.339 --> 00:50.741
Get out of here.

00:50.743 --> 00:52.376
And they speak to me.

00:52.378 --> 00:54.415
Vicious.

00:54.417 --> 00:57.563
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:57.565 --> 00:59.268
It doesn't matter where you are.
I'll find you.

00:59.270 --> 01:00.836
I rely on my partner.

01:00.838 --> 01:02.473
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:02.475 --> 01:04.376
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:04.378 --> 01:06.079
This guy's a real piece of work.

01:06.081 --> 01:09.755
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:09.757 --> 01:11.258
I feel like I live in a house of Hell.

01:11.260 --> 01:12.426
It's my job to reveal them.

01:12.428 --> 01:14.699
This is not good.

01:14.701 --> 01:16.437
But Steve and I never speak...

01:16.439 --> 01:18.473
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:18.475 --> 01:20.242
Until the very end.

01:20.244 --> 01:21.713
I want my life back.

01:21.715 --> 01:24.185
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:24.187 --> 01:25.788
Is he trying to kill her?

01:25.790 --> 01:27.057
Or time to get out.

01:27.059 --> 01:28.728
Oh, my god.

01:28.730 --> 01:30.065
This is going to kill us.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074

01:43.732 --> 01:46.072
I'm in the small town of Falconer,
New York.

01:46.074 --> 01:47.941
It's about an hour south of Buffalo.

01:49.010 --> 01:50.914
I received a call from a woman named Sheila.

01:50.916 --> 01:53.688
She said there's something
very wrong in her new home.

01:53.690 --> 01:56.560
The activity is nonstop, and it's violent.

01:56.562 --> 01:58.266
Everybody in the house is living in fear.

01:58.268 --> 02:01.003
But Sheila says her 14-year-old daughter is

02:01.005 --> 02:02.504
getting the worst of it.

02:02.506 --> 02:04.741
She says she may be in grave danger.

02:10.449 --> 02:12.086
Before Amy arrives,

02:12.088 --> 02:16.458
I look for anything that
might influence her findings.

02:16.460 --> 02:17.727
Once all the family photos

02:17.729 --> 02:19.832
and personal items are covered or removed,

02:19.834 --> 02:22.536
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

02:38.531 --> 02:40.264
Oh, boy.

02:42.067 --> 02:45.873
I'm getting lots of anger and drugs.

02:45.875 --> 02:49.278
Someone is sick.

02:49.280 --> 02:51.282
Currently?

02:51.284 --> 02:52.885
It feels like it.

02:54.621 --> 02:56.991
Lots of pain.

03:00.133 --> 03:02.801
Ugh, this person is a disaster.

03:10.710 --> 03:12.210
Sheila, when we spoke on the phone,

03:12.212 --> 03:14.011
I know you were upset,

03:14.013 --> 03:16.549
and it sounds like you've
got a problem here.

03:16.551 --> 03:18.187
Tell me a little bit about what's going on.

03:18.189 --> 03:22.193
It seems like something
is targeting my daughter.

03:22.195 --> 03:24.430
It's very hard for her to be here.

03:24.432 --> 03:26.366
She doesn't want to be here.

03:26.368 --> 03:28.635
There's nothing I can do to protect her

03:28.637 --> 03:30.838
'cause I don't know what's going on.

03:30.840 --> 03:34.108
I mean, she's having experiences every day.

03:34.110 --> 03:35.743
She's having a lot of stomach issues,

03:35.745 --> 03:37.914
and the doctors can't find
anything wrong with her.

03:37.916 --> 03:40.016
At one point, she had bruises on her hand

03:40.018 --> 03:41.985
that looked like somebody grabbed her.

03:43.588 --> 03:46.687
And that was really what prompted me

03:46.689 --> 03:49.653
to try and find somebody to help us.

03:49.655 --> 03:52.894
So, who exactly is living in the house?

03:52.896 --> 03:56.229
That's my husband, George.

03:56.231 --> 03:58.200
- This is my daughter, Sara.
- Sara?

03:58.202 --> 04:01.406
And that's my 15-year-old son, Nathan.

04:01.408 --> 04:02.774
Okay.

04:02.776 --> 04:04.775
We've all had experiences.

04:04.777 --> 04:06.111
Okay.

04:06.113 --> 04:09.148
There's all kinds of noises in the house.

04:09.150 --> 04:11.915
We have a lot things that
just come up missing.

04:11.917 --> 04:14.953
My back has been worse than it's ever been.

04:14.955 --> 04:17.356
Now, what kind of back pain
are you talking about?

04:17.358 --> 04:19.524
Severe, stabbing pain,

04:19.526 --> 04:22.125
where sometimes it takes your breath away.

04:22.128 --> 04:25.228
And now it's to the point where, you know,

04:25.230 --> 04:28.063
I'm going to different doctors,
having injections,

04:28.065 --> 04:31.567
and taking medication just
so that I can basically do

04:31.569 --> 04:32.501
what I need to do.

04:33.802 --> 04:36.003
This isn't normal.
There's something going on.

04:42.810 --> 04:45.378
A lot of pain,
a lot of pain, physical pain.

04:45.380 --> 04:48.547
Somebody is [bleep] in
a lot of [bleep] pain.

04:48.549 --> 04:54.420
It's really bad back pain,
like super [bleep] bad.

05:01.957 --> 05:08.394
First, I have no idea how
anybody [bleep] lives here.

05:11.466 --> 05:15.569
I don't know how they sleep.
I don't know how they eat.

05:15.571 --> 05:19.973
I don't know how they can leave.

05:21.709 --> 05:24.774
And just the physical pain

05:24.776 --> 05:31.545
that I feel that they're
dealing with is ridiculous.

05:37.282 --> 05:38.883
So, Sheila,
why did you bring me outside?

05:38.885 --> 05:41.652
I see somebody walking up the steps.

05:41.654 --> 05:43.554
And there's a couch right in there

05:43.556 --> 05:45.456
where I sit at night,

05:45.458 --> 05:47.560
and I'm thinking somebody's
coming to the door.

05:47.562 --> 05:50.659
So, I'll get up and answer,
you know, go to the door,

05:50.661 --> 05:52.095
and there's nobody there.

05:52.097 --> 05:54.865
Can you make out any features at all,
like a face or anything.

05:54.867 --> 05:56.966
No, it kind of happens really quick,

05:56.968 --> 05:59.469
but it looks more like a shadowy figure.

05:59.471 --> 06:03.909
Okay, so, have you ever seen
this figure anyplace else?

06:03.911 --> 06:05.578
Yes, inside the house.

06:05.580 --> 06:07.249
Okay, show me.

06:11.953 --> 06:13.754
I was sitting on that same couch,

06:13.756 --> 06:17.059
and I heard footsteps
coming down these stairs,

06:17.061 --> 06:19.559
so I was looking to see who it was,

06:19.561 --> 06:21.294
and I never heard the door open,

06:21.296 --> 06:24.364
but, all of a sudden,
I saw that same shadowy figure,

06:24.366 --> 06:27.563
like, look around the corner at me

06:27.565 --> 06:29.667
and then came right back
towards this direction.

06:29.669 --> 06:31.269
All right, so, you come to investigate,

06:31.271 --> 06:32.971
and you're sure there was nobody down here?

06:32.973 --> 06:34.069
I'm positive.

06:34.071 --> 06:36.270
Okay, did you hear it go back up the steps?

06:36.272 --> 06:38.141
No, I did not.

06:38.143 --> 06:40.343
Okay.

06:40.345 --> 06:42.812
And you definitely hear the door.

06:42.814 --> 06:46.081
I got no explanation for it other
than what you're telling me.

06:46.083 --> 06:48.116
What do you really hoping
for us to do for you?

06:48.118 --> 06:50.885
Well, I'm hoping to be able to find out

06:50.887 --> 06:53.419
whatever it is that's hurting Sara.

06:53.421 --> 06:56.553
Just show us how or tell
us how we can get rid of it

06:56.555 --> 06:59.022
so that we can have an everyday life,

06:59.024 --> 07:01.859
she can stay here without having
to worry about being alone.

07:01.861 --> 07:03.328
I don't know what else I can do.

07:03.330 --> 07:06.131
Okay.

07:10.304 --> 07:13.340
There's, like, this guy.

07:13.342 --> 07:15.406
He's super-religious...

07:15.408 --> 07:20.845
like <i> super-religious.</i>

07:20.847 --> 07:22.178
Wow.

07:23.247 --> 07:29.285
He wants everyone in this home to leave

07:29.287 --> 07:32.557
because they are unclean.

07:34.124 --> 07:36.891
So, you know,
he's haunting the [bleep] out of them.

07:38.493 --> 07:39.893
What does he do?

07:39.895 --> 07:42.062
He acts like a ghost.

07:42.064 --> 07:45.200
Out of here, he will stomp.

07:45.202 --> 07:47.705
Like, he'll...

07:49.742 --> 07:55.477
He gives no privacy

07:55.479 --> 07:59.413
and lets it be known there's no privacy.

08:05.583 --> 08:07.917
So, Sara, I was talking to Mom earlier

08:07.919 --> 08:09.922
about the stuff that's going on here.

08:09.924 --> 08:11.525
And the reason I took this
case is because of you

08:11.527 --> 08:13.258
and what she said you're going through.

08:13.260 --> 08:16.559
She mentioned some physical problems.

08:16.561 --> 08:17.628
What's happening?

08:17.630 --> 08:19.730
Ever since we moved into this house,

08:19.732 --> 08:21.231
I've had really bad stomach pains

08:21.233 --> 08:24.199
that feel like someone's
stabbing me all the time,

08:24.201 --> 08:27.038
and I've gone to like 10 doctors about it,

08:27.040 --> 08:29.239
and none of them can
figure out what's wrong.

08:29.241 --> 08:32.544
Is that the only physical
thing you're having, I mean?

08:32.546 --> 08:34.881
I'll wake up at night,
and I'll be getting scratched,

08:34.883 --> 08:36.381
and even the whole family,

08:36.383 --> 08:39.318
like, says that it's centered around me.

08:39.320 --> 08:41.623
These scratches that
you're getting, I mean,

08:41.625 --> 08:43.256
how bad are we talking about?

08:43.259 --> 08:44.625
What are they looking like?

08:44.627 --> 08:46.626
They'll go away within three or four days,

08:46.628 --> 08:48.562
but I've had some that have scarred over.

08:48.564 --> 08:50.563
So I've had some bleeding.

08:50.565 --> 08:52.498
Where do you generally get these scratches?

08:52.500 --> 08:54.800
On my thigh and my lower back.

08:54.802 --> 08:56.302
You have cats here. Yeah.

08:56.304 --> 08:57.804
Are we pretty sure it's not that?

08:57.806 --> 08:59.574
Yeah, 'cause I had them
before the cats were here.

08:59.576 --> 09:00.709
Before the cats.

09:00.711 --> 09:02.343
Anything else physical happening to you?

09:02.345 --> 09:04.511
I've gotten bruises on my arm.

09:06.281 --> 09:07.848
What kind of bruises?

09:07.850 --> 09:11.015
Like,
something's grabbing my arm and hurting me.

09:11.017 --> 09:14.082
It looked like four fingers going across,

09:14.084 --> 09:15.150
and they were really big,

09:15.152 --> 09:17.319
like,
probably two times the size of my hand.

09:17.321 --> 09:19.321
- So, like a man's hands.
- Yes.

09:22.692 --> 09:28.531
The religious guy,
he prefers a particular woman here.

09:28.533 --> 09:31.899
I see him looming over her.

09:33.803 --> 09:38.473
He can make physical contact.
Like, he just grabbed my head.

09:38.475 --> 09:41.845
He was making it known
that he can touch me,

09:41.847 --> 09:45.612
and it felt like a tingling
where his fingers would be,

09:45.614 --> 09:48.116
like down into my brain even.

09:48.118 --> 09:53.521
He gets super-big, smothering,
you know, trying to smother.

09:53.523 --> 09:56.292
Pressure, panic.

09:56.294 --> 09:58.428
The way that he smothers people is

09:58.430 --> 10:02.228
he sticks his fingers in
their mouth and down their...

10:02.230 --> 10:03.864
He makes people choke.

10:06.197 --> 10:08.864
He's like, "This is chaos,

10:08.866 --> 10:11.838
"and they need to fix
it and take care of it

10:11.840 --> 10:18.612
and accept Jesus Christ,"
into, you know, their lives.

10:18.614 --> 10:19.881
Okay.

10:21.919 --> 10:25.592
Things going on all the time.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.598
They're being tortured.

10:52.443 --> 10:53.979
So, George, I was talking to Sheila,

10:53.981 --> 10:55.746
and you guys are practically newlyweds,
right?

10:55.748 --> 10:56.848
Yes.

10:56.850 --> 10:59.286
But it seems like you can't even enjoy it.

10:59.288 --> 11:00.818
No.

11:00.820 --> 11:02.752
And I know you must be concerned for Sara,
as well.

11:02.754 --> 11:05.188
Being the stepdad,
it's my job to protect the family,

11:05.190 --> 11:07.026
and it just freaks me out

11:07.028 --> 11:10.361
that I can't prevent
what's happening to her.

11:10.363 --> 11:12.365
Do you ever experience anything?

11:12.367 --> 11:15.040
On two occasions,
something was on the porch,

11:15.042 --> 11:19.107
so got the flashlight,
and I took off toward the garage,

11:19.109 --> 11:22.776
and whatever it was went into the garage.

11:22.778 --> 11:26.714
Everything that was in
its way was pushed aside.

11:26.716 --> 11:29.751
It makes the hair on the
back of my neck stand up

11:29.753 --> 11:33.719
because if I can't catch
and if I can't see it

11:33.721 --> 11:35.689
and if I can't stop it,

11:35.691 --> 11:38.625
how can I stop it from
coming into the house?

11:38.627 --> 11:40.694
So, George,
with all this stuff going on in the house,

11:40.696 --> 11:42.396
have you tried any kind of...

11:42.398 --> 11:44.999
get help here or anything like that?

11:45.001 --> 11:47.634
One afternoon,
somebody stopped by the house,

11:47.636 --> 11:49.838
and I'm like, "Excuse me. Can I help you?

11:49.840 --> 11:51.507
Do you have the right house?"

11:51.509 --> 11:54.678
And he says, "Yeah,
I'm from your wife's church."

11:54.680 --> 11:58.784
He was wearing the old-style,
black-rimmed hat...

11:58.786 --> 12:00.820
Okay.

12:00.822 --> 12:04.126
And a full-length black jacket.

12:04.128 --> 12:06.130
Like an old preacher type of thing?

12:06.132 --> 12:08.067
Yes, exactly like an old preacher,

12:08.069 --> 12:10.505
like from the early 1900s maybe.

12:10.507 --> 12:13.705
So, he comes in,
and he checks out the house,

12:13.707 --> 12:16.008
and he starts to make for the door.

12:16.010 --> 12:17.777
I'm like, "Oh, hey, wait a minute.

12:17.779 --> 12:18.945
You got anything to tell us?"

12:18.947 --> 12:22.751
And he just looks at me
dead in the face and says,

12:22.753 --> 12:23.919
"I can't help you."

12:23.921 --> 12:25.521
Did you tell your wife what happened?

12:25.523 --> 12:26.556
Yes, I did.

12:26.558 --> 12:27.791
As soon as she came home, I told her.

12:27.793 --> 12:31.128
I said, "Hey,
your friend from the church came."

12:31.130 --> 12:32.197
And she says, "What friend?"

12:40.812 --> 12:48.622
I would say that this is not
a very good area in the house.

12:48.624 --> 12:50.624
This religious guy,

12:50.626 --> 12:55.660
he doesn't like it up here, either.

12:55.662 --> 12:59.534
It makes him agitated.

12:59.536 --> 13:06.008
He thinks that there is
something evil here.

13:07.846 --> 13:09.744
This is not good.

13:09.746 --> 13:12.979
From his religious perspective,

13:12.981 --> 13:17.481
it's, you know,
some kind of demon or something.

13:20.285 --> 13:22.188
Something kills people here.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.498
So, when I was talking to Mom,

13:31.500 --> 13:34.333
she mentioned that everybody's
having experiences in the house,

13:34.335 --> 13:35.868
and I was wondering about you.

13:35.870 --> 13:37.303
I used to sleep in this bed right here

13:37.305 --> 13:38.437
and had a laptop there.

13:38.439 --> 13:39.736
I would watch stuff before I went to sleep.

13:39.738 --> 13:41.939
And I used to see eyes peering at me

13:41.941 --> 13:44.705
through this door leading
into the bathroom.

13:44.707 --> 13:45.972
Describe what it looked like.

13:45.974 --> 13:47.373
It kind of just looked like

13:47.375 --> 13:49.376
just two sets of balls that were red,

13:49.378 --> 13:51.277
that were right next to each other.

13:51.279 --> 13:53.879
Are you sure it's not something
you're looking at on your laptop

13:53.881 --> 13:55.214
that's screwing your eyes up?

13:55.216 --> 13:57.452
No, 'cause, I mean, I'm
trying to comprehend

13:57.454 --> 13:59.690
what's going on and find
a way to just prove

13:59.692 --> 14:01.658
that it's not, you know, paranormal.

14:01.660 --> 14:04.195
Right,
and you're not coming up with any answers?

14:04.197 --> 14:05.497
I haven't come up with
anything other than...

14:05.499 --> 14:06.597
Yeah, nothing.

14:06.599 --> 14:08.898
Okay, so, is there anything else going on?

14:08.900 --> 14:11.299
Well, I have a few items go
missing for months at a time

14:11.301 --> 14:12.866
that I've know I placed somewhere.

14:12.868 --> 14:14.099
What kind of stuff?

14:14.101 --> 14:17.735
It's been water bottles,
keys, a belt one time.

14:17.737 --> 14:18.971
It's not there when you check,

14:18.973 --> 14:20.339
and then you come back,
and it's in the spot.

14:20.341 --> 14:22.408
Like, you know it was there before,

14:22.410 --> 14:23.842
but you couldn't find it.

14:23.844 --> 14:26.675
Are you having trouble going
to bed at night or sleeping?

14:26.677 --> 14:28.177
Yeah, sometimes.

14:28.179 --> 14:29.514
I've always had feeling
that somebody's watched me

14:29.516 --> 14:32.348
from that corner ever since we moved in.

14:37.419 --> 14:39.254
God.

14:43.892 --> 14:46.559
It gets even worse in here.

14:46.561 --> 14:50.696
There's something here that I'm missing.

14:50.698 --> 14:54.534
And I'm gonna tell you that
it can [bleep] jump people,

14:54.536 --> 14:56.734
get inside of people's bodies.

14:56.736 --> 14:59.606
I don't think it's this religious guy.

14:59.608 --> 15:02.175
It feels feminine.

15:02.177 --> 15:03.775
This person's good.

15:03.777 --> 15:05.542
They're [bleep] good.

15:05.544 --> 15:08.145
Really strong.

15:10.584 --> 15:12.250
She knows how to [bleep] hide.

15:12.252 --> 15:13.251
She knows that I...

15:13.253 --> 15:14.921
They're dangerous when they can...

15:14.923 --> 15:15.823
[bleep] dangerous.

15:15.825 --> 15:19.565
She makes people sick.

15:19.567 --> 15:23.536
This is way deliberate,
<i>way</i> intentional.

15:23.538 --> 15:24.837
Definitely.

15:24.839 --> 15:32.581
And she messed people up.

15:49.350 --> 15:51.119
Sheila and George didn't know anything

15:51.121 --> 15:52.622
about the history of their property,

15:52.624 --> 15:53.958
so I made few calls.

15:53.960 --> 15:56.362
Turns out one of the original owners

15:56.364 --> 15:57.664
had real bad go of things.

15:59.233 --> 16:01.568
I'm heading over to meet
with a local historian

16:01.570 --> 16:02.902
who says this story is filled

16:02.904 --> 16:05.273
with heartbreak, insanity, and death.

16:14.312 --> 16:16.844
What can you tell me
about the Southland family?

16:16.846 --> 16:21.415
Jon and his wife, Jane,
purchased the property in 1869.

16:21.417 --> 16:25.786
They had 75 acres of land,
and he was a farmer.

16:25.788 --> 16:28.656
I have an 1881 atlas of Chautauqua County

16:28.658 --> 16:31.392
which shows the property, the 75 acres.

16:32.761 --> 16:35.496
Okay, Now, on the phone,
you said things were tough

16:35.498 --> 16:37.099
for this family. What did you mean by that?

16:37.101 --> 16:41.873
In 1880,
John and his wife were out one morning

16:41.875 --> 16:43.474
- for a ride in their carriage.
- Okay.

16:43.476 --> 16:45.444
And something spooked the horses,

16:45.446 --> 16:47.449
and they veered very hard,

16:47.451 --> 16:50.419
and it caused the carriage to topple over.

16:50.421 --> 16:53.121
Jonathan apparently hit his head.

16:53.123 --> 16:56.122
He managed to hold on to the reins,

16:56.124 --> 16:57.523
but he was dragged behind the horses.

16:57.525 --> 17:02.463
He managed to control them,
and he hitched them to a post

17:02.465 --> 17:06.165
and went back to aid his
wife and dropped dead.

17:06.167 --> 17:08.000
Wow.

17:09.035 --> 17:12.138
He must have had some hit to the head.

17:12.141 --> 17:13.575
So, I would assume that
Jane got the property then

17:13.577 --> 17:14.909
once he passed.

17:14.911 --> 17:17.645
No, at that time period,
a woman didn't automatically inherit

17:17.646 --> 17:20.314
her husband's full estate
because there were children.

17:20.316 --> 17:23.252
- Okay.
- They had two grown sons.

17:23.253 --> 17:25.386
Martin was 31, and Charles was 25.

17:25.387 --> 17:28.020
And they were the ones
who inherited the farm.

17:28.021 --> 17:29.288
And so, what happens?

17:29.290 --> 17:32.625
In 1883, Martin was committed

17:32.627 --> 17:35.496
to a mental institution in Buffalo.

17:35.498 --> 17:36.931
What was his issue?

17:36.933 --> 17:39.503
His commitment was for
religious excitement.

17:40.538 --> 17:41.536
What does that mean?

17:41.538 --> 17:44.739
In the mid to late 1800s,

17:44.741 --> 17:47.542
people were being exposed to spiritualism

17:47.544 --> 17:52.344
and Mormonism and other new beliefs.

17:52.346 --> 17:55.947
Perhaps his family was
concerned about that.

17:57.016 --> 18:00.053
Geez.

18:00.055 --> 18:02.089
He was classified as insane.

18:06.864 --> 18:11.434
This guy I met earlier,
he speaks funny.

18:12.703 --> 18:14.974
He does. He speaks strange.

18:14.976 --> 18:16.377
How?

18:16.379 --> 18:19.381
Like old-fashioned.

18:20.416 --> 18:24.792
This creepy religious guy is
suddenly opening up to me,

18:24.794 --> 18:27.894
and I'm seeing glimpses of
what he was like in life.

18:27.896 --> 18:30.231
I thought he was in his 60s, but, actually,

18:30.233 --> 18:31.734
looking at him when he was healthy,

18:31.736 --> 18:34.102
he might have been younger.

18:34.104 --> 18:36.771
In his 50s, maybe, I'm thinking.

18:36.773 --> 18:41.242
He's very skittish.

18:42.311 --> 18:44.479
He's like, "Where are you going?

18:44.481 --> 18:45.715
"Where are you going? What's up? What's up?

18:45.717 --> 18:46.950
"Where are you going? Where are you going?

18:46.952 --> 18:49.017
Okay, okay, okay, okay."

18:50.585 --> 18:55.721
He was detained at some point in his life.

18:58.423 --> 19:01.092
So, yeah, he had problems,
you know, with his family.

19:01.094 --> 19:02.327
There were problems there.

19:02.329 --> 19:03.794
Hmm.

19:04.828 --> 19:09.964
He's okay with us knowing some
things but not everything.

19:11.935 --> 19:13.369
So, now, what happens to him?

19:13.371 --> 19:17.270
Well, he was discharged from
that commitment in 1883.

19:17.272 --> 19:19.839
I don't know how long he was there in 1883,

19:19.841 --> 19:22.008
but I found him in later census records

19:22.010 --> 19:23.978
working in Buffalo as a shoemaker.

19:23.980 --> 19:25.915
So, was he okay after that?

19:25.917 --> 19:28.416
Well, he apparently wasn't,

19:28.418 --> 19:30.882
because he ended up taking his own life.

19:31.983 --> 19:34.653
He slit his own throat with a razor.

19:34.655 --> 19:36.856
Geez.

19:38.558 --> 19:41.394
Martin kills himself in 1909.

19:41.396 --> 19:44.534
- He was 60 years old at the time.
- Right.

19:44.536 --> 19:46.536
This is interesting... "An effort
is being made to find relatives."

19:46.538 --> 19:47.703
Correct.

19:47.705 --> 19:51.037
His brother's gone. His parents are gone.

19:51.039 --> 19:52.371
He was pretty much alone.

19:58.311 --> 20:03.609
He, uh, got really hurt, really bad.

20:05.578 --> 20:07.279
He goes, "Then, it all just stopped."

20:09.783 --> 20:13.049
Mmm...

20:13.051 --> 20:14.451
He's like, "I was trying to...

20:14.453 --> 20:16.587
I got to get to the church.
I got to get to the church."

20:17.622 --> 20:22.926
Didn't work out that way.
Mm, they put him in the ground.

20:22.928 --> 20:25.362
They just threw him in the ground.

20:31.736 --> 20:35.474
But he's not angry anymore,
not angry anymore.

20:35.476 --> 20:41.011
Now it's the sad. He's sad.

20:52.426 --> 20:55.263
Now that I know a former
owner of Sheila and George's property

20:55.265 --> 20:57.367
was committed to mental institution

20:57.369 --> 20:59.438
and later committed suicide,

20:59.440 --> 21:00.940
I need to see if there's anything else

21:00.942 --> 21:03.142
that could help my case.

21:04.143 --> 21:07.713
Searching through old records,
I come across the Crapo family

21:07.715 --> 21:14.254
and find not one but four deaths
all inside my clients' house.

21:14.256 --> 21:16.559
I'm heading over to meet
with a local genealogist

21:16.561 --> 21:18.259
who says she's got information

21:18.261 --> 21:19.695
that will definitely help my case.

21:27.008 --> 21:30.509
So, in my research,
I came across the Crapo family

21:30.511 --> 21:31.776
that lived on my clients' property.

21:31.778 --> 21:33.879
What do you know about the family itself?

21:33.881 --> 21:36.483
Well, Archie Crapo and his
wife and his four children

21:36.485 --> 21:42.456
moved here from Kansas in 1931
during the Great Depression.

21:42.458 --> 21:44.927
I saw that there was four
deaths inside the house.

21:44.929 --> 21:46.429
What do you know about those?

21:46.431 --> 21:50.599
By this time, Archie had moved
his ailing parents in with them.

21:50.601 --> 21:52.433
The first death was Archie's mother

21:52.435 --> 21:54.635
in January of 1948,

21:54.637 --> 21:56.970
and she died of heart failure.

21:56.972 --> 21:59.107
And this is her death certificate.

21:59.109 --> 22:00.843
She was 88 years old.

22:00.845 --> 22:02.111
Mm-hmm.

22:02.113 --> 22:05.181
Well, less than a month later,
her husband dies.

22:05.183 --> 22:09.054
His official cause of death
was heart failure, as well.

22:09.056 --> 22:10.689
Was he around the same age?

22:10.691 --> 22:11.690
I think he was about 96.

22:11.692 --> 22:13.126
Wow.

22:13.128 --> 22:14.829
So, what was the third death?

22:14.831 --> 22:18.165
The third death happens in 1962...

22:18.167 --> 22:20.033
Archie's wife, Carola.

22:20.035 --> 22:22.368
After a long struggle with lung cancer,

22:22.370 --> 22:24.271
she passes away in the house.

22:26.941 --> 22:28.242
She was 67.

22:30.313 --> 22:31.849
But what was the fourth one?

22:31.851 --> 22:35.020
Well, Archie sold the house to his son,
Joseph,

22:35.022 --> 22:36.555
and his wife, Joyce, and their two kids.

22:36.557 --> 22:38.057
Okay.

22:38.059 --> 22:41.993
And soon after they moved her mother in,
Margaret Penticoff.

22:41.995 --> 22:46.232
She passes away on February 1, 1975

22:46.234 --> 22:49.300
of congestive heart failure in the house.

22:49.302 --> 22:50.301
This is a photo of her?

22:50.303 --> 22:52.772
This is a photo of her.

22:52.774 --> 22:54.240
I mean, I know it's natural causes,

22:54.242 --> 22:57.074
but, I mean, this house is like bad luck.

22:59.212 --> 23:02.481
What the hell? There's some lady.

23:02.483 --> 23:04.249
And they're flipping the [bleep] out.

23:07.323 --> 23:11.924
Feisty, feisty,
and not happy that we're here,

23:11.926 --> 23:18.563
and she's like spitting at
us and calling us names.

23:18.565 --> 23:21.768
We'd probably maybe hear her yelling

23:21.770 --> 23:23.804
or maybe see her quickly.

23:25.609 --> 23:27.410
Any idea what time
period she might be from?

23:27.412 --> 23:29.246
'70s or '80s.

23:33.252 --> 23:37.086
The little old lady from outside,

23:37.088 --> 23:39.619
she likes it in here.

23:41.521 --> 23:43.689
She's vomiting.

23:44.990 --> 23:46.823
I think she died here.

23:47.892 --> 23:49.225
It was fast.

23:49.227 --> 23:51.226
I don't know if it's her heart.

23:53.060 --> 23:56.930
This is making me too sick.

24:01.903 --> 24:04.973
It's not healthy for the living

24:04.975 --> 24:09.911
to be in that area

24:09.913 --> 24:14.047
because they are...

24:14.049 --> 24:16.984
Absorbing that.

24:16.986 --> 24:19.854
And that's very bad for them.

24:24.395 --> 24:25.862
Look,
I don't know if this is gonna help my case,

24:25.864 --> 24:28.364
but during my research,
one thing really caught my eye...

24:28.366 --> 24:30.366
the murder of a pregnant girl

24:30.368 --> 24:32.336
less than a mile from my client's house.

24:32.338 --> 24:35.170
I'm heading over to meet
with a local police sergeant

24:35.172 --> 24:37.273
who said this is one of
the most brutal murders

24:37.275 --> 24:38.543
in the county's history.

24:43.781 --> 24:45.982
The reason I called you is
I came across that article

24:45.984 --> 24:49.520
about a 7-month-pregnant
female that was murdered

24:49.522 --> 24:52.324
within less than a mile from my clients'
property,

24:52.326 --> 24:54.325
and you were able to look into it for me.

24:54.327 --> 24:56.225
Yeah, that's why I brought you here.

24:56.227 --> 24:58.160
Just a couple hundred
yards up the riverbank is

24:58.162 --> 24:59.494
where the woman's body was found.

24:59.496 --> 25:01.663
Okay, so when did this happen?

25:01.665 --> 25:03.366
It was September 23, 1899.

25:03.368 --> 25:05.469
It was about 8:00 at night.

25:05.471 --> 25:07.671
There was three boys that were
walking along the riverbank,

25:07.673 --> 25:09.138
and they heard a woman screaming.

25:09.140 --> 25:11.975
The three of them went down
to the edge of the riverbank,

25:11.977 --> 25:13.843
and they found the woman facedown,

25:13.845 --> 25:15.045
partially in the water.

25:15.047 --> 25:19.151
They turned her over and
immediately noticed

25:19.153 --> 25:21.753
that she was bleeding
severely from her neck.

25:21.755 --> 25:24.391
Before the doctor could come, she had died.

25:25.526 --> 25:27.793
Okay, now,
did they ever wind up identifying her?

25:27.795 --> 25:28.762
Yes.

25:28.764 --> 25:30.298
They identified her at the morgue

25:30.300 --> 25:33.204
as 26-year-old Emily Adolphson.

25:33.206 --> 25:34.806
She was a Swedish immigrant.

25:34.808 --> 25:37.710
Her throat had been slit from
her chin to her spinal column,

25:37.712 --> 25:38.445
and she bled to death.

25:38.447 --> 25:39.713
Okay.

25:39.715 --> 25:42.680
And they also determined that
she was 7 months pregnant.

25:44.550 --> 25:48.021
So, did they have any idea
who might have done this?

25:48.023 --> 25:50.325
She had a lover named Frank Vennerholm.

25:50.327 --> 25:51.930
Now, did they go after this guy?

25:51.932 --> 25:53.663
They go in the early morning hours,

25:53.665 --> 25:56.034
and they go to his
residence to interview him.

25:56.036 --> 25:59.037
They scour the apartment

25:59.039 --> 26:01.103
just trying to look for some evidence.

26:01.105 --> 26:02.838
They go into the closet,

26:02.840 --> 26:05.775
and they find a pair of pants and a vest

26:05.777 --> 26:07.409
that are covered in mud and blood.

26:07.411 --> 26:10.080
And then, he gets arrested.

26:10.082 --> 26:12.283
So, does it go to trial?
Does he get indicted?

26:12.285 --> 26:14.720
- Yes.
- And so, how'd the trial go?

26:14.722 --> 26:17.423
They find Vennerholm guilty
for the murder of Emily.

26:17.425 --> 26:19.025
Okay.

26:19.027 --> 26:25.134
On July 16, 1901, Vennerholm was
executed in Auburn, New York.

26:25.136 --> 26:27.037
Does this guy ever confess to anything?

26:27.039 --> 26:28.438
He never confesses.

26:28.440 --> 26:29.939
- Never?
- Never.

26:32.076 --> 26:33.043
There's a woman.

26:33.045 --> 26:34.043
She's crying.

26:34.045 --> 26:36.245
There's a river, or, like, a stream.

26:36.247 --> 26:39.246
Something about that and
something about her child.

26:39.248 --> 26:41.980
Usually, she's down like this,

26:41.982 --> 26:43.617
and she's like rocking, you know,

26:43.619 --> 26:45.452
and she's like, "Aah," crying.

26:45.454 --> 26:46.787
But then, she stands up,

26:46.789 --> 26:50.256
and she becomes this big different,

26:50.258 --> 26:55.196
totally different kind
of thing, uh, person.

26:55.198 --> 26:58.764
I think that's, like, really,
like, her pain and everything,

26:58.766 --> 26:59.767
like, comes up like that.

26:59.769 --> 27:01.771
And then, she's screaming.

27:05.073 --> 27:09.408
If someone sees this happening,
it's not good for them.

27:18.384 --> 27:21.051
I saw several dead people during my walk,

27:21.053 --> 27:23.887
but the religious man
smothering a female in the house

27:23.889 --> 27:25.955
has me the most concerned.

27:25.957 --> 27:29.892
There was a female on the bed.

27:29.894 --> 27:35.799
And there was a male there.

27:35.801 --> 27:41.143
He would kind of make himself into a black,
thick mass.

27:46.049 --> 27:47.449
Amy, is this what you saw?

27:47.451 --> 27:49.718
Yes.

28:09.493 --> 28:12.628
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

28:12.630 --> 28:15.064
we're ready to reveal our
findings to each other

28:15.066 --> 28:17.866
and our clients for the first time.

28:17.868 --> 28:19.432
Amy, I'd like you to
meet George and Sheila.

28:19.434 --> 28:21.400
This is their home.

28:21.402 --> 28:22.435
They've owned it about two years.

28:22.437 --> 28:24.704
Now, the activity's really bad here.

28:24.706 --> 28:26.340
They actually live here

28:26.342 --> 28:29.778
with Sheila's son, Nathan, who's 15.

28:29.780 --> 28:31.679
This is Evan, who's 18,

28:31.681 --> 28:33.014
who moved out about 10 days ago?

28:33.016 --> 28:34.149
Mm-hmm.

28:34.151 --> 28:35.383
And this is Sara, who's 14,

28:35.385 --> 28:36.884
and she's the main reason we're here.

28:36.886 --> 28:38.685
And she's a sweet kid,

28:38.687 --> 28:41.151
and she's getting physically attacked.

28:41.153 --> 28:42.921
They're desperate for help,
and that's why they called us.

28:42.923 --> 28:45.326
So, now that Amy knows a little
bit about what's going on,

28:45.328 --> 28:46.995
I'm gonna ask her to
tell us about her walk.

28:51.197 --> 28:53.601
When I first arrived,

28:53.603 --> 28:55.202
I noticed this little old lady there,

28:55.204 --> 28:59.071
and she was yelling at me from the garage.

28:59.073 --> 29:02.176
Later on, in the house,

29:02.178 --> 29:03.742
I encountered her in the kitchen,

29:03.744 --> 29:08.143
and I saw her and felt
her become extremely ill,

29:08.145 --> 29:10.413
like violently ill.

29:10.415 --> 29:14.252
She was vomiting, extreme stomach pain.

29:14.254 --> 29:16.921
It's like... I'm like,
"Maybe this is a heart attack."

29:16.923 --> 29:20.787
She projects it out so intensely

29:20.789 --> 29:22.789
that the living would absorb this,

29:22.791 --> 29:25.491
and it would physically affect you.

29:25.493 --> 29:32.968
So, I don't think it's good
for you to be in that area.

29:32.970 --> 29:36.940
I do think that she died
possibly in the kitchen,

29:36.942 --> 29:41.078
and fairly recently... '70s, '80s.

29:41.080 --> 29:43.748
You know,
the one thing that really struck me odd

29:43.750 --> 29:45.449
during the research for your property...

29:45.451 --> 29:47.785
actually, the home itself...

29:47.787 --> 29:49.856
was that four people actually
died right inside the house.

29:49.858 --> 29:51.491
Oh, my.

29:51.493 --> 29:54.394
- Three of them were women.
- Oh.

29:54.396 --> 29:55.796
And all from the same family.

29:55.798 --> 30:00.701
Now, who I think you may be
talking about is this woman.

30:00.703 --> 30:02.135
This is Margaret Penticoff.

30:02.137 --> 30:04.474
She died of congestive heart failure

30:04.476 --> 30:08.311
in 1975 in the home.

30:08.313 --> 30:10.711
Okay. How old was she when she died?

30:10.713 --> 30:12.578
She was pretty young... 62.

30:12.580 --> 30:15.515
Yeah, that looks like her.

30:15.517 --> 30:17.251
The lips and the nose.

30:19.819 --> 30:22.522
- It's a little disconcerting.
- Yeah.

30:22.524 --> 30:25.556
Yeah,
that definitely might have put a difference

30:25.558 --> 30:29.192
onto whether or not I would
have bought the house, honestly,

30:29.194 --> 30:31.929
had I known.

30:31.931 --> 30:39.439
The other thing was when
I got to the porch area,

30:39.441 --> 30:43.077
I felt a lot of anger,

30:43.079 --> 30:47.484
and this anger is actually
from a living person.

30:47.486 --> 30:52.124
I felt that someone
who's living in the house

30:52.126 --> 30:53.424
is actually very sick.

30:53.426 --> 30:58.864
I felt extreme physical pain,
especially in the back.

31:01.168 --> 31:03.335
Yeah, it was really bad.

31:03.337 --> 31:05.001
That would be me.

31:06.369 --> 31:08.705
And pretty
much every single thing

31:08.707 --> 31:10.107
that I go through every day.

31:12.376 --> 31:15.743
And I'm angry because I hurt so bad.

31:15.745 --> 31:18.615
It sucks.

31:24.285 --> 31:28.723
And I get anxiety, and I can't breathe.

31:28.725 --> 31:32.130
So, every single thing you
said just nailed it up.

31:33.735 --> 31:36.838
And it's just kind of nice
to know that somebody knows

31:36.840 --> 31:38.473
that I'm making it up.

31:38.475 --> 31:40.140
Mm-hmm.

31:40.142 --> 31:41.741
I can see it upsets you
seeing your wife like that.

31:41.743 --> 31:43.109
It does.

31:43.111 --> 31:46.545
You know,
and I really can't do anything to help her.

31:46.547 --> 31:49.279
Well, I didn't even realize I was angry

31:49.281 --> 31:52.216
until you said it, and I want my life back.

31:53.453 --> 31:55.153
I couldn't believe

31:55.155 --> 31:57.523
that people could even get
out of bed in the morning

31:57.525 --> 32:00.862
or do anything because it's so severe.

32:00.864 --> 32:03.133
I was just overwhelmed.

32:03.135 --> 32:07.941
I felt that there were possibly
other people in the house

32:07.943 --> 32:10.878
that might be having health issues, too.

32:10.880 --> 32:12.614
Well, Sara... You've been taking her

32:12.616 --> 32:14.536
to the doctors for how
long for her stomach?

32:14.561 --> 32:15.517
A year and a half.

32:15.519 --> 32:18.755
And they can't find anything wrong.

32:24.761 --> 32:26.462
What else did you get?

32:26.464 --> 32:32.497
So, there's one male that's
causing a lot of problems here.

32:32.499 --> 32:35.465
Right off the bat, it was...

32:35.467 --> 32:37.367
You know, he was telling me, you know,

32:37.369 --> 32:42.371
that he's extremely religious, that you...

32:42.373 --> 32:44.472
the family that's there now...

32:44.474 --> 32:48.608
needs to accept Jesus Christ
into your hearts as your savior.

32:48.610 --> 32:51.678
He despises everybody in the house,

32:51.680 --> 32:53.612
and he wants you all out

32:53.614 --> 32:55.916
because he believes you
are not clean or pure,

32:55.918 --> 32:59.782
and he is taking on the role of a ghost.

32:59.784 --> 33:03.955
He was showing himself
becoming massive and dark,

33:03.957 --> 33:05.557
and he was showing me

33:05.559 --> 33:09.428
how he would stomp down the hallway

33:09.430 --> 33:11.300
between the rooms and
be in the hall like...

33:12.736 --> 33:15.437
The footstep stuff
is something they all hear.

33:15.439 --> 33:18.076
Oh, yeah.

33:18.078 --> 33:20.446
Yep, on a daily basis.

33:21.716 --> 33:24.053
Now, you see a shadow figure

33:24.055 --> 33:26.090
- coming up the porch all the time.
- Yeah.

33:26.092 --> 33:28.692
Like somebody's coming up the stairs

33:28.694 --> 33:32.297
and then passing the windows
and going to the door,

33:32.299 --> 33:33.797
but when I go to answer the door,

33:33.799 --> 33:35.366
- there's nobody there.
- Mm-hmm.

33:35.368 --> 33:37.502
You got a real interesting story.

33:37.504 --> 33:39.370
It was about 2:30 in the morning.

33:39.372 --> 33:42.504
The shadow was on the porch, and I said,

33:42.506 --> 33:44.439
"I'm gonna do something,"

33:44.441 --> 33:45.540
so I grabbed the flashlight,

33:45.542 --> 33:47.241
I opened the door, and this thing took off.

33:47.243 --> 33:48.943
- And I gave chase.
- Mm-hmm.

33:48.945 --> 33:52.380
And we get to the garage,
and I stopped immediately

33:52.382 --> 33:58.288
because whatever it was just
cleared a path for itself.

33:58.290 --> 34:01.258
The bikes were thrown to
the left and to the right.

34:01.260 --> 34:03.394
I didn't know what to do.

34:03.396 --> 34:04.595
Now,
does the stuff they're describing

34:04.597 --> 34:06.297
sound like it's him?

34:06.299 --> 34:08.532
I think so because those are all things

34:08.534 --> 34:12.672
that I think he believes would bother you.

34:12.675 --> 34:15.976
But the other thing that he would do is

34:15.978 --> 34:18.982
become physical towards people.

34:18.984 --> 34:21.485
He touched my head.

34:21.487 --> 34:28.464
He also showed me him kind
of trying to smother people.

34:28.466 --> 34:32.135
He likes to get close to certain
people while they're in bed.

34:32.137 --> 34:34.304
He likes to take his fingers

34:34.306 --> 34:36.005
and try to push them down people's throats

34:36.007 --> 34:39.172
to make you choke.

34:39.175 --> 34:43.945
This man kind of has his sights set

34:43.947 --> 34:47.478
on one female in particular
in the household,

34:47.481 --> 34:49.844
and the one thing that I did see
was that she had longer hair.

34:51.649 --> 34:54.719
What he would do is, like,
go to the end of the bed

34:54.722 --> 34:56.387
and, like, become this dark,

34:56.389 --> 34:57.752
you know, this darkness

34:57.754 --> 34:59.754
and would then show me him,

34:59.756 --> 35:03.324
like, laying on top of this person.

35:03.326 --> 35:06.899
Yeah, that is quite disturbing.

35:06.901 --> 35:10.530
The main reason we're here
is for your daughter, Sara.

35:10.555 --> 35:11.437
Right.

35:11.439 --> 35:14.108
- And she just kind of described her.
- Yeah.

35:14.110 --> 35:15.578
But she's also been getting scratched.

35:15.580 --> 35:16.912
Okay.

35:16.914 --> 35:19.516
And at one point, it had looked

35:19.518 --> 35:22.488
like somebody had taken her by the wrist

35:22.490 --> 35:25.258
and held her wrist tight,
and she was bruised.

35:26.895 --> 35:30.867
I explained the situation to an artist,
and she drew it.

35:30.869 --> 35:32.601
Of what he's doing?

35:32.603 --> 35:33.769
Yes.

35:37.742 --> 35:39.177
Oh, geez.

35:44.151 --> 35:45.083
Wow.

35:50.086 --> 35:53.689
Wow.

35:53.691 --> 35:56.793
Yeah, that's very disturbing.

35:59.666 --> 36:02.135
You can't even protect her from him.

36:02.137 --> 36:04.534
That's the infuriating part.

36:04.536 --> 36:07.135
I can't... That's my job.

36:07.137 --> 36:08.671
I can't do it.

36:08.673 --> 36:13.976
But it at least explains
some things of why maybe

36:13.978 --> 36:15.812
nobody could find out
what's going on with her.

36:17.081 --> 36:18.280
They're not gonna find it.

36:18.282 --> 36:20.115
It's not anything that
any doctors can find.

36:20.117 --> 36:23.155
Mm-hmm. Yeah, exactly.

36:27.060 --> 36:30.062
Do you have any idea who this
guy might have been in life?

36:30.064 --> 36:31.966
Well, the first thing is, obviously,

36:32.167 --> 36:36.106
he was <i> extremely</i> religious.

36:36.108 --> 36:37.775
I know that at some point he
was living with his mother,

36:37.777 --> 36:43.412
also that he was, at some point, detained.

36:43.414 --> 36:45.281
When I first met him,

36:45.283 --> 36:49.819
he was kind of giving me
the details about his death.

36:49.821 --> 36:53.325
And there was extreme head and chest pain,

36:53.327 --> 36:56.995
and then everything just stopped for him.

36:56.997 --> 37:01.765
He was, I mean, severely injured and hurt.

37:01.767 --> 37:03.833
Well, a lot of who you're describing

37:03.835 --> 37:05.134
reminds me of a guy

37:05.136 --> 37:07.169
that actually lived on
your property at one time.

37:07.171 --> 37:09.204
Now, a guy named Martin Southland

37:09.206 --> 37:12.442
moved onto your property
with this parents in 1869.

37:12.444 --> 37:14.142
You said the guy was detained.

37:14.144 --> 37:15.911
Well, he was institutionalized three times.

37:15.913 --> 37:16.979
Oh.

37:16.981 --> 37:21.282
1871, 1878, and then again in 1883.

37:21.284 --> 37:23.318
And you said the guy was a religious freak,
right?

37:23.320 --> 37:26.086
- Uh, yes.
- Okay.

37:26.088 --> 37:28.556
So, the article I came across for him...

37:28.558 --> 37:30.725
According to this, he's "mentally disturbed

37:30.727 --> 37:32.261
by religious excitement."

37:33.397 --> 37:36.001
And the other thing you said...
He was a painful death?

37:36.003 --> 37:37.636
Mm-hmm.

37:37.638 --> 37:39.839
He didn't do it on the property,
but he was living in Buffalo.

37:39.841 --> 37:41.875
At the age of 60, he committed suicide,

37:41.877 --> 37:42.878
and he cut his throat.

37:42.880 --> 37:44.014
Oh.

37:44.016 --> 37:46.051
Makes sense, it does.

37:52.825 --> 37:54.125
Okay, you've got a lot going on.

37:54.127 --> 37:55.927
I mean, did you encounter anything else?

37:55.929 --> 37:57.362
Yes, I did.

37:57.364 --> 37:59.231
Geez.

37:59.233 --> 38:04.708
The upstairs is a very, very bad area.

38:04.710 --> 38:06.276
Okay.

38:06.278 --> 38:08.944
I figured out that there was someone

38:08.946 --> 38:11.247
or something there that could jump you.

38:11.249 --> 38:15.416
So, this means that they can
enter your body and take over.

38:15.418 --> 38:20.752
So, initially, I was assuming
that it was the religious male,

38:20.754 --> 38:25.022
but later,
I figured out that it's actually a female.

38:25.024 --> 38:28.022
She's really good.

38:28.024 --> 38:29.690
Like, she can hide.

38:29.692 --> 38:33.794
That scares me.

38:33.796 --> 38:37.165
I think that she is very dangerous,

38:37.167 --> 38:41.369
and I think she has an
extreme effect on the living.

38:41.371 --> 38:44.039
One of things that she's doing
to draw out her energy needs

38:44.041 --> 38:46.675
is to actually tap into
the electrical impulses

38:46.677 --> 38:51.213
of the human brain and feed off of that,
as well.

38:51.215 --> 38:56.487
And this could possibly cause
brain damage in the long term.

38:56.489 --> 39:00.793
We feel lost. I don't know what to do.

39:00.795 --> 39:02.794
There's no words that can even describe

39:02.796 --> 39:03.829
how I feel about it.

39:03.831 --> 39:06.231
Totally helpless.

39:23.566 --> 39:24.700
Well, all I can say is

39:24.702 --> 39:26.203
I'm glad you guys called us when you did

39:26.205 --> 39:29.208
because, obviously,
you've got a serious problem in your house.

39:29.210 --> 39:31.408
The big question is do you stay and fight,

39:31.410 --> 39:33.776
or do you pack up your bags

39:33.778 --> 39:36.611
and take Nathan and Sara, especially,

39:36.613 --> 39:38.812
and move the hell out of here?

39:38.814 --> 39:41.712
For the answer to that question,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:43.313 --> 39:46.380
I have some good news and some bad news.

39:46.382 --> 39:52.385
Unfortunately,
there's nothing that can really be done

39:52.387 --> 39:54.888
in the case of the elderly woman.

39:54.890 --> 39:57.861
If someone was to approach her

39:57.863 --> 40:02.166
and try to tell her that she's deceased,

40:02.168 --> 40:05.835
it would make matters worse.

40:05.837 --> 40:08.337
As far as the religious man,

40:08.339 --> 40:11.877
I think the best thing
to do is to reach out

40:11.879 --> 40:16.818
to an Evangelical or Pentecostal church.

40:16.820 --> 40:19.587
And you need to find a holy person,

40:19.589 --> 40:23.927
and this person needs to deliver
a sermon a perform a blessing.

40:23.929 --> 40:27.063
And then, once that's done,
he'll move right on.

40:29.501 --> 40:32.000
So, what do they do about
this woman that jumps people?

40:32.002 --> 40:33.233
There needs to be three sensitives.

40:33.235 --> 40:37.402
It needs to be two females and one male.

40:37.404 --> 40:39.168
One of them has to be a physical medium.

40:39.170 --> 40:40.969
The other two, I want to be different,

40:40.971 --> 40:45.810
whatever,
like a psychic knower or a psychic empath.

40:45.812 --> 40:48.445
And what they need to do is
actually have sÃ©ance upstairs.

40:51.317 --> 40:54.085
That's how they're going
to basically trap her...

40:54.087 --> 40:56.355
amongst the three of them.

40:56.357 --> 41:00.026
And then,
each one is going to do what they do

41:00.028 --> 41:02.396
to move a deceased person on.

41:02.398 --> 41:06.234
And then, once that's completed,
she'll be gone.

41:06.236 --> 41:09.671
In the meantime,

41:09.673 --> 41:15.341
because your daughter is so sensitive,

41:15.343 --> 41:18.645
I do think that she
should not be in the house

41:18.647 --> 41:19.746
until this is completed.

41:22.046 --> 41:23.545
And things could get a lot more intense.

41:24.983 --> 41:27.550
Now, the question is will
there be a change in Sara

41:27.552 --> 41:28.518
when all this is done?

41:28.520 --> 41:30.754
I mean, she should be fine.

41:32.323 --> 41:33.623
I'm glad to hear that.

41:33.625 --> 41:35.424
And, you know, I don't even have to ask you

41:35.426 --> 41:36.891
if you're gonna take Amy's advice.

41:36.893 --> 41:38.291
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yes.

41:38.293 --> 41:39.890
Without question.

41:39.892 --> 41:42.234
No, I just really want to
get started with these tasks

41:42.334 --> 41:43.999
that we have that Amy has given us

41:44.001 --> 41:45.668
so that we can help Sara,

41:45.670 --> 41:46.870
help the family, and get our house back.

41:46.872 --> 41:49.241
It's like taking that big sigh

41:49.341 --> 41:51.207
that you've wanted to take forever.

41:52.443 --> 41:55.509
I really hope Sheila
and George follow my advice

41:55.511 --> 41:56.843
and deal with the dangerous entities

41:56.845 --> 41:58.544
terrorizing their family.

41:58.546 --> 42:01.547
With the help of priest and mediums,

42:01.549 --> 42:03.416
they should be able to
free their home of evil

42:03.418 --> 42:05.085
and lead a peaceful life.
