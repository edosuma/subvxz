Okay? 'Cause I don't think
I can do this alone.

11:24.442 --> 11:27.721
Great. Great.
Let's go. Hurry!

11:27.756 --> 11:30.310
-We're the idiots.
-Yeah.

11:35.142 --> 11:38.111
Sags in the middle,
but it was cheap.

11:38.145 --> 11:39.768
Besides, I don't sleep much.

11:39.802 --> 11:43.116
Yeah, I could tell.
A lot of coffee cups.

11:43.150 --> 11:44.427
Must get expensive.

11:44.462 --> 11:46.982
What can I say?
I love my dark roast.

11:47.016 --> 11:50.606
[both chuckle]

11:50.640 --> 11:53.160
I never really liked
the taste of coffee.

11:53.195 --> 11:57.717
Oh, it's just about the beans.
I'll take you to my spot.

11:59.304 --> 12:01.997
You look exhausted.

12:02.031 --> 12:05.932
No, I'm-I'm fine.

12:05.966 --> 12:08.728
Tell me what's up?

12:13.318 --> 12:15.838
This place is no joke, Dej.

12:18.807 --> 12:22.500
I mean, I knew it wouldn't be,
it's Harvard, but...

12:22.534 --> 12:23.984
it's on a whole 'nother level.

12:25.986 --> 12:28.437
You know, if there's not
a test one day,

12:28.471 --> 12:30.473
there's a paper due
the next Monday.

12:30.508 --> 12:34.650
And I got Janelle half the time.
Jennifer doesn't make it easy.

12:34.684 --> 12:36.963
And if I'm not studying,
I'm working.

12:36.997 --> 12:39.689
'Cause scholarships, they cover
tuition, but not books

12:39.724 --> 12:42.692
and food and clothes and...

12:42.727 --> 12:44.349
How much time do you need
to finish your paper?

12:44.384 --> 12:48.146
No. No way. No, you're
only here for a day.

12:48.181 --> 12:51.805
Look, Malik, how much time?

12:51.840 --> 12:55.705
Like, an hour.

12:55.740 --> 12:59.640
Take two.

12:59.675 --> 13:02.022
-Are you serious?
-I'm serious.

13:02.057 --> 13:04.680
-You sure?
-Very sure.

13:04.714 --> 13:06.820
Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank...

13:06.855 --> 13:09.547
Mwah, mwah, mwah.

13:09.581 --> 13:10.962
I'm gonna make it up
to you tonight.

13:10.997 --> 13:13.862
After my paper, we goin' out.

13:17.417 --> 13:19.350
[door shuts]

13:21.697 --> 13:23.147
NICKY:
Okay...

13:23.181 --> 13:26.357
Hello, Sally. Hi, Sally.

13:26.391 --> 13:28.842
-[doorbell rings]
-It's been... 50...

13:28.877 --> 13:31.465
-It's been 50 years.
-REBECCA: I hear someone.

13:31.500 --> 13:33.640
Someone's home.

13:33.674 --> 13:34.952
-MIGUEL: Really?
-REBECCA: Uh-huh.

13:34.986 --> 13:36.125
I don't think so.

13:36.160 --> 13:37.299
-[Rebecca gasps]
-Oh, okay.

13:37.333 --> 13:38.541
MIGUEL:
Here we go.

13:40.889 --> 13:44.168
It's her. It's her.
It's her.

13:46.204 --> 13:49.000
Hello?

13:49.035 --> 13:50.346
Say "Hi, Sally."

13:55.006 --> 13:56.525
I finally made it
to California,

13:56.559 --> 13:59.666
and boy are my arms tired.

13:59.700 --> 14:02.151
I'm sorry, do I know you?

14:02.186 --> 14:04.050
Okay...

14:04.084 --> 14:05.741
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Hi, Sally.

14:05.775 --> 14:08.330
This is, uh, Nicky Pearson.

14:08.364 --> 14:11.851
In 1969, his path
crossed with yours

14:11.885 --> 14:15.716
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
on your way to Woodstock.

14:15.751 --> 14:17.857
And he's been pining
for you ever since.

14:17.891 --> 14:22.585
Oh, and he, um,
he got you this gift here.

14:22.620 --> 14:24.415
It's an old camera,
'cause I remember

14:24.449 --> 14:26.796
you used to take pictures.

14:37.773 --> 14:39.740
Oh, my God.

14:41.604 --> 14:43.192
[chuckles]

14:45.436 --> 14:47.369
Hello, Nicky.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.787
Hello, Sally.

14:57.620 --> 15:00.727
♪

15:21.610 --> 15:23.232
-Nice.
-Mm-hmm.

15:26.235 --> 15:27.754
You've got an eye.

15:27.788 --> 15:31.068
Oh, no, that was taken
by a friend of mine

15:31.102 --> 15:32.586
in Cambria.

15:32.621 --> 15:35.244
A pro.

15:35.279 --> 15:38.282
No, I, uh, got a job at
a pharmaceutical company

15:38.316 --> 15:40.801
in the late '70s.
Help yourself.

15:40.836 --> 15:44.840
And, uh, well, photography
became more of a hobby.

15:49.051 --> 15:52.089
How was Woodstock?

15:52.123 --> 15:54.746
[chuckles]
Wet.

15:54.781 --> 15:57.957
It rained a lot.

15:57.991 --> 15:59.889
My friends told me
I'm in Scorsese's

15:59.924 --> 16:02.030
Woodstock documentary.

16:02.064 --> 16:05.033
They say I'm dancing topless.

16:05.067 --> 16:08.726
But I can't bring myself
to watch it.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.108
Oh, I could certainly
bring myself to watch that.

16:11.142 --> 16:12.626
Yeah.

16:14.145 --> 16:17.079
[laughs]

16:21.290 --> 16:22.982
Oh...

16:24.293 --> 16:26.571
Oh, what do we have here?

16:26.606 --> 16:28.470
Oh, hi, hi. Um...

16:28.504 --> 16:30.265
Well, these are old friends
of mine

16:30.299 --> 16:32.094
from when I lived
in Pittsburgh.

16:32.129 --> 16:34.062
This is my husband Eric.

16:34.096 --> 16:37.065
Nicky and Miguel and...

16:37.099 --> 16:38.652
Rebecca. Hi.

16:38.687 --> 16:41.586
-ERIC: Hey. Nice to meet you.
-REBECCA: Very nice to meet you.

16:41.621 --> 16:44.417
MIGUEL:
You have a very lovely...

16:44.451 --> 16:46.591
Yeah, well, uh,
we should be going.

16:46.626 --> 16:48.490
So, thanks for letting us
use the can there.

16:48.524 --> 16:51.251
Well, stay for dinner.

16:51.286 --> 16:52.666
REBECCA:
No, no, no, no.

16:52.701 --> 16:55.255
We wouldn't want to impose.

16:55.290 --> 16:58.569
Oh, come on.
We have plenty of food.

16:58.603 --> 17:01.434
Yeah, yeah, please.

17:01.468 --> 17:04.782
Uh, yeah, please stay.
Uh... insist.

17:06.853 --> 17:09.925
-Sure.
-Sure. Thank you.

17:09.959 --> 17:12.617
-We'll... We'll stay.
-SALLY: That's lovely.
[chuckles]

17:16.173 --> 17:18.106
Hey, Dej.

17:23.973 --> 17:27.632
Wow, you, uh... Um...

17:27.667 --> 17:29.117
You, uh...

17:30.877 --> 17:33.604
Y-You look...

17:33.638 --> 17:35.157
incandescent.

17:35.192 --> 17:37.987
[laughs]

17:38.022 --> 17:39.334
Okay, Harvard.

17:39.368 --> 17:41.508
[both laugh]

17:41.543 --> 17:44.891
Sure this isn't too much?

17:44.925 --> 17:48.170
Babe, you sat on a bus

17:48.205 --> 17:50.517
that I know smelled rank

17:50.552 --> 17:53.037
-for five hours.
-Mm-hmm.

17:53.072 --> 17:56.040
And you had to deal with
my messy Jennifer situation,

17:56.075 --> 17:57.697
and you still gave me
the two hours

17:57.731 --> 18:01.390
I desperately needed to finish
my Russian Lit paper.

18:01.425 --> 18:05.360
You're not too much.

18:05.394 --> 18:09.329
This dress is not too much.
I love it.

18:12.332 --> 18:15.301
I love you.

18:15.335 --> 18:18.511
I don't know whether to keep you
here or show you off.

18:20.685 --> 18:23.999
-Show me off.
-[both giggle]

18:24.033 --> 18:28.141
I seem to remember you
having a brother, Nicky.

18:28.176 --> 18:30.488
Yeah, Jack. He's dead.

18:30.523 --> 18:33.146
He was my husband.

18:33.181 --> 18:35.528
And he was Miguel's best friend,

18:35.562 --> 18:37.357
but he didn't,
he didn't snake his widow.

18:39.048 --> 18:42.051
I see. I think.

18:42.086 --> 18:44.537
Nicky, help me.

18:44.571 --> 18:48.057
It's so long ago.
Where did we meet?

18:49.921 --> 18:51.371
At the vet's.

18:51.406 --> 18:54.512
Ah, okay.

18:54.547 --> 18:56.859
We worked together one summer

18:56.894 --> 19:00.380
at the veterinarian clinic
in Pittsburgh.

19:00.415 --> 19:03.694
Yes. In June of 1969.

19:03.728 --> 19:06.904
And you were wearing a long,

19:06.938 --> 19:08.802
red floral dress.

19:10.735 --> 19:14.739
And I sort of asked you out
on a date,

19:14.774 --> 19:18.847
which we spent in the back
of your Volkswagen van

19:18.881 --> 19:22.747
you named Pearl.

19:22.782 --> 19:26.061
And you, uh...

19:26.095 --> 19:30.238
You deflowered me under a moon

19:30.272 --> 19:32.895
that men had just walked upon.

19:35.553 --> 19:38.246
Oh, my God.

19:38.280 --> 19:40.524
Yes.

19:40.558 --> 19:44.390
Yes, it's all coming back
to me now.

19:44.424 --> 19:47.220
The moon. Your parents.

19:47.255 --> 19:50.568
-Salisbury steak. [laughs]
-[laughs]

19:50.603 --> 19:51.880
Oh, gosh.

19:51.914 --> 19:53.709
For a minute there
I thought I had

19:53.744 --> 19:56.091
early onset Alzheimer's.

19:56.125 --> 19:59.405
Or not just early.
Plain old Alzheimer's.

19:59.439 --> 20:01.752
-[laughs]
-ERIC: Deflowered, huh?

20:01.786 --> 20:06.412
Seems my wife defoliated
much of the northeast.

20:06.446 --> 20:08.137
You reaped the rewards.

20:08.172 --> 20:09.587
ERIC:
Oh, she could teach
a master class.

20:09.622 --> 20:11.244
SALLY:
Ah. Cheers.

20:11.279 --> 20:13.108
MIGUEL:
This meal is excellent.

20:13.142 --> 20:17.077
You know, Rebecca has
a cold asparagus soup recipe.

20:17.112 --> 20:19.632
JACK:
Perfect end to a perfect day.

20:19.666 --> 20:22.704
[chuckles]

20:22.738 --> 20:26.052
I'm gonna get one
of these sometime. Someday.

20:26.086 --> 20:28.261
I mean, after we buy

20:28.296 --> 20:30.953
a sensible family car,
of course.

20:30.988 --> 20:33.370
You know, maybe like
a midlife crisis purchase.

20:33.404 --> 20:36.165
-Just warning you.
-[laughs]

20:39.099 --> 20:41.895
I always thought the wind in my
hair would be overrated,

20:41.930 --> 20:44.450
but it is properly rated.

20:45.451 --> 20:49.972
A car like this can make
a person feel immortal.

20:51.974 --> 20:53.735
I don't need a car
to feel that.

20:53.769 --> 20:55.461
I got you.

21:00.120 --> 21:02.261
I'm not even a cold soup guy,

21:02.295 --> 21:05.091
but hers is just some...

21:05.125 --> 21:07.473
I do have Alzheimer's.

21:09.820 --> 21:13.410
Yeah, I have, um, plaques

21:13.444 --> 21:15.653
forming on my brain,

21:15.688 --> 21:20.417
and no amount of medications
or word exercises

21:20.451 --> 21:21.763
will cure me.

21:21.797 --> 21:23.799
First goes
the short-term memory,

21:23.834 --> 21:26.112
and then the longer ones,
one by one.

21:26.146 --> 21:29.840
Or is it a thousand each day?

21:29.874 --> 21:32.463
I don't even know.

21:32.498 --> 21:37.951
Sometimes I think about what
my very last memory will be

21:37.986 --> 21:41.161
before the candle goes out.

21:45.614 --> 21:48.272
I am so embarrassed.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.585
Rebecca, I'm sorry.
I-I had no idea.

21:50.619 --> 21:53.173
No, no, no, you wouldn't know.

21:53.208 --> 21:57.661
You would think
that this diagnosis

21:57.695 --> 21:59.352
would help me sweat
the small stuff less,

21:59.387 --> 22:01.975
but not really.

22:02.010 --> 22:04.184
I just, this morning,

22:04.219 --> 22:07.291
rolling out the garbage cans
before we left was something

22:07.326 --> 22:09.431
that kept nagging at me.

22:09.466 --> 22:11.778
Even during this dinner,
this strange dinner,

22:11.813 --> 22:13.953
I thought about them.

22:13.987 --> 22:18.302
You'd think that we would
stop sweating the small stuff

22:18.337 --> 22:21.788
as we got older,
when bigger things

22:21.823 --> 22:26.034
started happening to us,
but nope.

22:26.068 --> 22:29.796
Not the case.

22:29.831 --> 22:32.661
It's so strange, isn't it?

22:37.079 --> 22:39.012
ERIC:
The deck.

22:39.047 --> 22:44.432
I-I worry about the deck
we-we built out back.

22:44.466 --> 22:47.296
Um...

22:47.331 --> 22:48.367
it was built without permits,

22:48.401 --> 22:49.954
and I'm afraid it's gonna
collapse,

22:49.989 --> 22:52.025
or the city's gonna find out
and, you know, come after me.

22:52.060 --> 22:54.994
It's stupid, I know,
but I wonder

22:55.028 --> 22:59.032
how many, uh, months I've spent

22:59.067 --> 23:01.863
thinking about that day.

23:01.897 --> 23:06.039
I still look at my hairbrush
in the morning,

23:06.074 --> 23:07.662
looking for fallout.

23:09.664 --> 23:12.149
It's kind of my signature thing,
my hair.

23:12.183 --> 23:14.047
You have great hair.

23:14.082 --> 23:16.325
-MIGUEL: You, too, Nicky.
-Thank you.
-[Sally chuckles]

23:16.360 --> 23:19.639
I've only lost, like,
seven strands in 30 years.

23:19.674 --> 23:24.057
But still, I worry that
I'm gonna lose all my hair.

23:24.092 --> 23:27.854
The years that I have lost

23:27.889 --> 23:29.718
worrying about something
that never happened.

23:29.753 --> 23:33.377
Hmm. Mm-hmm.

23:33.412 --> 23:37.208
NICKY [sighs]:
Oh, God,

23:37.243 --> 23:39.866
I wonder how many years

23:39.901 --> 23:43.076
I spent thinking about Sally.

23:43.111 --> 23:45.216
I mean...

23:45.251 --> 23:49.497
oh, like, decades maybe?
I don't know.

23:49.531 --> 23:54.225
But, uh, you know, uh,
I d-- I don't regret that.

23:54.260 --> 23:56.814
That, um...

23:56.849 --> 24:00.542
those lost years.

24:00.577 --> 24:04.063
I think... I think
it got me through.

24:04.097 --> 24:08.654
It gave me, uh, reason to hope

24:08.688 --> 24:11.691
that, you know, one day
something good might happen

24:11.726 --> 24:12.865
to me.

24:16.869 --> 24:20.838
Maybe it was all leading up
to this, the...

24:20.873 --> 24:23.876
most awkward meal of all time.

24:26.706 --> 24:29.537
But not a waste of time.

24:29.571 --> 24:31.884
No way.

24:31.918 --> 24:33.955
Not for me.

24:37.130 --> 24:39.236
That's lovely, Nicky.
