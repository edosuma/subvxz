00:10.140 --> 00:11.402
This was
an important day for me

00:11.446 --> 00:13.013
and I wanted
to share it with you.

00:13.056 --> 00:14.231
I have things I want
to tell you,

00:14.275 --> 00:17.060
but I can't.
- Then you should take this.

00:17.104 --> 00:19.715
- Are you breaking up with me?
- Yeah.

The ascension is nearly
upon us, my friends.

Go, merge with your other self.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.118

No!

Anderson is dead,

02:24.970 --> 02:27.277
our family was a disaster,

02:27.321 --> 02:29.279
to put it mildly,

02:29.323 --> 02:31.847
and everything Ally
was preaching was true.

02:31.890 --> 02:34.154
I tried to stop her.
I really did.

02:34.197 --> 02:37.069
I just wasn't strong enough.

02:37.113 --> 02:39.376
So if Ally Allston merged
with her bizarro self,

02:39.420 --> 02:41.248
does that mean
she's some sort of god now?

02:41.291 --> 02:42.510
I don't know what she is.

02:42.553 --> 02:44.207
All I know is that pendant
gave her power,

02:44.251 --> 02:46.601
a lot of power,
and the Jon that came here

02:46.644 --> 02:49.430
wants to do the same thing
with you.

02:49.473 --> 02:51.432
Yeah, I could tell.

02:51.475 --> 02:54.522
Sweetheart, we are not going
to let that happen.

02:54.565 --> 02:56.480
Yeah, but he can do
everything Dad can do, right?

02:56.524 --> 02:59.309
Yes, but he's on our Earth.

02:59.353 --> 03:00.745
The yellow sun
should weaken him

03:00.789 --> 03:02.486
the same way
the red sun weakened me.

03:02.530 --> 03:04.227
He's still
pretty strong though.

03:04.271 --> 03:05.924
He had no problem
kicking my ass.

03:05.968 --> 03:07.187
What are we supposed to do?

03:07.230 --> 03:10.059
Hide out--hide out
at your fortress?

03:10.102 --> 03:12.192
Have you been having visions?

03:12.235 --> 03:15.195
No.
I mean, I've had this, like,

03:15.238 --> 03:16.805
weird brain freeze feeling

03:16.848 --> 03:18.850
when I was walking
Candice home earlier tonight.

03:18.894 --> 03:21.766
But, what? Why?
Is that like the visions

03:21.810 --> 03:23.246
you were getting
from the other Superman?

03:23.290 --> 03:25.596
It sounds like
the beginning of them.

03:25.640 --> 03:26.989
Great.

03:27.032 --> 03:28.643
Does that mean
he'll get a lot more of them?

03:28.686 --> 03:30.775
Probably and when you do,

03:30.819 --> 03:33.256
he's gonna be able to see
where we are.

03:33.300 --> 03:36.259
Not if we can stop them from
happening in the first place.

03:36.303 --> 03:38.261
I'll go see if John Henry
is still up.

03:47.096 --> 03:51.318
Jonathan, I know things
have been rough between us,

03:51.361 --> 03:54.538
but none of that matters.

03:54.582 --> 03:59.021
You're my son and I love you.

03:59.064 --> 04:01.241
And I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

04:18.954 --> 04:21.391
You sure now's a good time
to be texting Sarah?

04:21.435 --> 04:22.958
I know she's up.

04:23.001 --> 04:25.395
That's not
what I'm talking about.

04:25.439 --> 04:26.744
Nothing's happening
with Jon right now, Mom.

04:34.012 --> 04:36.276
I have to fix this with her.

04:36.319 --> 04:38.887
She dumped me 'cause she thinks
I didn't see her as a priority,

04:38.930 --> 04:40.454
but that's just not true.

04:40.497 --> 04:43.021
You have had a lot
on your plate lately.

04:43.065 --> 04:45.502
Maybe she's noticed
how distracted you've been.

04:45.546 --> 04:47.983
That doesn't mean
she's not important to me.

04:48.026 --> 04:49.463
You know, and that's what
I've been trying to tell her,

04:49.506 --> 04:50.986
but she's not replying
to my texts.

04:51.029 --> 04:53.467
Well, she probably needs
some time to think, sweetie,

04:53.510 --> 04:56.513
and so do you.
- About what?

04:56.557 --> 04:58.254
You know, sometimes
when I'm working through

04:58.298 --> 05:00.648
a really big problem,

05:00.691 --> 05:02.780
I write it all down
in a letter.

05:02.824 --> 05:04.304
You're serious?

05:04.347 --> 05:06.131
A letter?
- Yeah.

05:06.175 --> 05:09.787
It helps me to take a breath
and process my emotions.

05:09.831 --> 05:12.355
And then when everything
is laid out in front of me,

05:12.399 --> 05:14.662
I can hone in
on what it is exactly

05:14.705 --> 05:17.055
that I'm trying to communicate.

05:17.099 --> 05:20.407
I think you should try that
instead of texting.

05:24.802 --> 05:27.022
Clark.

05:27.065 --> 05:29.329
It's gonna take a while to
figure something like this out.

05:29.372 --> 05:31.374
- Ballpark?
- No idea.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.594
I mean, disrupting inter--

05:33.637 --> 05:34.682
what does your mother call it?

05:34.725 --> 05:36.336
Inter-dimensional

05:36.379 --> 05:38.555
Yeah, that?
That's all new.

05:38.599 --> 05:40.862
I'm not sure I have any tech
that'll even work.

05:40.905 --> 05:43.386
Did your mother say anything
else that could be helpful?

05:43.430 --> 05:45.519
This is all new to her too.

You were gone for a month
away from your family.

I really, really have to go.

Okay.

06:57.678 --> 06:59.288
It's just things
have been crazy lately

06:59.331 --> 07:00.681
and I've got to
fix this thing at the farm.

07:00.724 --> 07:04.511
No, totally.
We'll catch up another time.

just like Jonathan said.

07:25.836 --> 07:29.492
But before I could get to him,
Lana ran into me.

07:29.536 --> 07:31.799
She said
I've been gone a month?

07:31.842 --> 07:34.497
It's been 33 days.

07:34.541 --> 07:36.499
How long was it
on the other world?

07:37.848 --> 07:39.459
A day? Maybe?

07:39.502 --> 07:41.722
So what, time moves
differently over there?

07:41.765 --> 07:43.463
Either that or
in the portals I went through

07:43.506 --> 07:45.943
which I really wish I'd known
before I ran into her.

07:45.987 --> 07:47.728
Why? What happened?

07:47.771 --> 07:51.340
She said you told her
I was on some assignment.

07:51.383 --> 07:52.820
That was the best
I could come up with.

07:52.863 --> 07:56.432
It's not your fault.
I just could tell she was hurt.

07:56.476 --> 07:59.696
She probably wanted to talk
about winning the election.

07:59.740 --> 08:02.133
She won?

08:02.177 --> 08:03.918
She moves into
her new office tomorrow.

08:03.961 --> 08:05.397
Maybe I should
just go over there later

08:05.441 --> 08:08.357
and smooth things over for you.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.187
Anything else
I should know about?

08:13.057 --> 08:14.276
Why didn't you just tell me

08:14.319 --> 08:15.973
those drugs
belonged to Candice?

08:16.017 --> 08:17.584
Dad, I thought you said that
everything was cool between us.

08:17.627 --> 08:19.107
It is, Jonathan,

08:19.150 --> 08:20.935
but I still want to understand
what you were thinking.

08:20.978 --> 08:23.938
Okay, well, clearly I didn't
want Candice to get in trouble.

08:23.981 --> 08:25.417
Well, maybe she should have.

08:25.461 --> 08:27.550
She was selling drugs.
- See?

08:27.594 --> 08:29.770
That's--that is exactly
why I didn't say anything.

08:29.813 --> 08:31.554
Because you ask me a question

08:31.598 --> 08:33.121
and then you don't even listen
to what I have to say.

08:33.164 --> 08:34.426
No, don't make this about me.

08:34.470 --> 08:36.994
I'm the one who was lying.

08:37.038 --> 08:38.561
Are you serious?

08:38.605 --> 08:41.390
You lied to me for 14 years
about who you actually are.

08:41.433 --> 08:43.348
No, Jonathan,
that is not the same thing.

08:43.392 --> 08:44.785
Yeah, it's worse.

08:44.828 --> 08:47.396
Because I lied
to protect someone else

08:47.439 --> 08:49.050
and he lied
to protect his own secret.

08:49.093 --> 08:52.140
That secret
keeps this family safe.

08:52.183 --> 08:53.663
It allows you
to have a normal life.

08:53.707 --> 08:56.361
One that isn't in the shadow
of me being Superman.

08:56.405 --> 08:58.450
Okay, well, if that's
what the secret's doing,

08:58.494 --> 09:01.062
it's doing a pretty crap job.
- Jonathan, I'm serious.

09:01.105 --> 09:03.630
On the other world, our family
lived without that secret.

09:03.673 --> 09:05.588
I know, okay?
You said that already

09:05.632 --> 09:08.635
and honestly,
it doesn't seem that bad

09:08.678 --> 09:10.637
because at least there
I have powers.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.508
Maybe then you'd actually
listen to me.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.075
Jon.

09:14.118 --> 09:15.685
You know what?

09:15.729 --> 09:18.732
I'll let you know if I have
any more visions or whatever.

09:25.434 --> 09:29.612
So how powerful
is Ally Allston now?

09:29.656 --> 09:33.094
Uh, Clark wasn't sure exactly.

09:33.137 --> 09:34.704
But stronger than Superman,

09:34.748 --> 09:37.533
the most powerful person
in the world.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.100
Ally Allston
isn't the problem.

09:39.143 --> 09:41.581
Not yet, but if Jonathan
merges with his bizzaro self,

09:41.624 --> 09:43.104
he'll be as strong as she is.

09:43.147 --> 09:44.409
It's not gonna happen.

09:44.453 --> 09:46.716
And he has the pendant
which mean he can create

09:46.760 --> 09:48.675
a whole army of people that
are stronger than Superman.

09:48.718 --> 09:50.328
Okay, look.

09:50.372 --> 09:53.636
You cannot spiral out
at the worst case scenario.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.725
You mean the one where your
entire planet gets destroyed

09:55.769 --> 09:58.902
and you lose everyone
you care about?

09:58.946 --> 10:00.991
Nat, that's not gonna happen.

10:01.035 --> 10:05.256
- How can you say that?
- Because I won't let it.

10:05.300 --> 10:08.956
There is nothing I won't do
to keep you safe.

10:08.999 --> 10:11.480
You hear me?

10:11.523 --> 10:13.482
Nothing.

10:14.657 --> 10:17.225
Good.

10:17.268 --> 10:18.748
'Cause I really need your help

10:18.792 --> 10:21.533
if I'm gonna get this thing
finished in time.

10:24.928 --> 10:26.626
I know that look.

10:26.669 --> 10:28.889
Jordan was texting me
nonstop last night

10:28.932 --> 10:33.850
and as soon as I message back,
nothing but radio silence, so.

10:33.894 --> 10:37.462
Yeah, well, I ran into
his dad in town last night

10:37.506 --> 10:39.203
and he was clearly wishing
I hadn't.

10:39.247 --> 10:41.684
Really?

10:41.728 --> 10:43.599
He always seems
so excited to see you.

10:43.643 --> 10:47.472
Yeah, I could literally feel
him trying to get rid of me.

10:47.516 --> 10:49.257
I mean, he didn't even
mention the election.

10:49.300 --> 10:51.215
I don't get it.
He's your biggest supporter.

10:51.259 --> 10:52.956
Yeah.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.089
I don't know.

10:55.132 --> 10:57.961
You know, there's always been
this other side of him

10:58.005 --> 11:01.051
that's a little... I don't know,

11:01.095 --> 11:04.272
not present.

11:04.315 --> 11:07.971
Yeah, Jordan used to
get like that too.

11:08.015 --> 11:10.670
Honey, I'm sorry.

11:10.713 --> 11:13.542
I know how tough it is
after a breakup.

11:16.023 --> 11:17.415
You know what?
It's all good.

11:17.459 --> 11:20.680
My mom, the mayor, is moving
into new offices today

11:20.723 --> 11:24.161
and I packed some boxes
to go inside of your car.

11:24.205 --> 11:27.164
You are the best
daughter ever,

11:27.208 --> 11:30.994
but I don't think we should
put those boxes in my car.

11:31.038 --> 11:32.387
Why not?

11:32.430 --> 11:36.217
Well,
because I would, um,

11:36.260 --> 11:38.480
rather...

11:39.394 --> 11:42.223
You drive them over in yours.

11:42.266 --> 11:44.616
Please tell me
you're not joking.

11:44.660 --> 11:47.750
Your dad and I both agreed
you've earned this.

11:47.794 --> 11:49.230
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you,

11:49.273 --> 11:52.146
thank you, thank you!

11:52.189 --> 11:55.018
Now, honey, it's only
for driving in Smallville.

11:55.062 --> 11:56.454
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:56.498 --> 11:58.413
And I want to know
where you are at all times.

11:58.456 --> 11:59.675
- Okay.
- Hey, Sarah.

11:59.719 --> 12:00.807
Huh?

12:00.850 --> 12:02.199
I'll meet you
over at the office.

12:02.243 --> 12:03.592
- Okay.
- Okay.

12:03.635 --> 12:05.986
Thank you.

12:18.781 --> 12:20.827
Have you been having
more of those visions?

12:23.046 --> 12:24.787
No, it was just--

12:24.831 --> 12:27.964
it was just Dad going all ape
over the X-K again.

12:28.008 --> 12:31.533
Yeah.

12:31.576 --> 12:33.187
What's that about?

12:33.230 --> 12:36.233
It's a letter
I wrote to Sarah.

12:36.277 --> 12:38.670
You wrote her a letter?

12:38.714 --> 12:41.456
What, is she taking a prairie
wagon to the 1880s or...

12:41.499 --> 12:45.112
Well, Mom took my phone, so.

12:45.155 --> 12:47.679
- Let me see.
- Uh...

12:49.246 --> 12:50.726
Bro.

12:55.122 --> 12:57.124
Let's see here. Um...

12:57.167 --> 12:58.429
"To Sarah,

12:58.473 --> 13:01.302
my dearest flower petal--"
- Okay, all right.

13:01.345 --> 13:03.783
Let me see.
No, let me see.

13:10.354 --> 13:12.313
Wow.

13:12.356 --> 13:14.924
Are you really
gonna give this to Sarah?

13:14.968 --> 13:16.534
Yeah.

13:21.452 --> 13:23.933
This is so cool.

13:26.980 --> 13:29.634
Oh.

13:29.678 --> 13:31.506
Hey.

13:31.549 --> 13:34.117
I didn't see you
whenever I was backing up.

13:34.161 --> 13:36.467
That's 'cause I just landed.

13:36.511 --> 13:39.166
Okay, what's with
the gloves and the jacket?

13:39.209 --> 13:40.602
I mean, Wellnitz is gonna have

13:40.645 --> 13:42.343
some serious opinions
about this.

13:42.386 --> 13:43.474
Do you really think I care

13:43.518 --> 13:46.129
what some
small town idiot thinks?

13:46.173 --> 13:48.088
Aren't you going to
say anything about the car?

13:50.177 --> 13:51.787
It's not bad,

13:51.831 --> 13:56.096
but I've pretty much been
all in on Lambo's recently so.

13:56.139 --> 13:57.445
Okay.

13:57.488 --> 14:01.666
Well, if you're gonna
be like that then...

14:01.710 --> 14:04.060
I'll just see you later.

14:04.104 --> 14:07.585
<i>♪ Young lady,</i> <i>
I'll scare 'em ♪</i>

14:07.629 --> 14:09.022
<i>♪ Whoo</i>

14:09.065 --> 14:16.029
<i>♪</i>

14:25.560 --> 14:27.344
Oh, honey, I'm so glad
you came back.

14:27.388 --> 14:29.433
I--I just found this.

14:31.479 --> 14:33.655
Jonathan.

14:33.698 --> 14:35.918
What are you doing here?

14:35.962 --> 14:42.882
<i>♪</i>

14:59.942 --> 15:01.726
Hey, Sarah,
is your mom around?

15:01.770 --> 15:03.337
Uh, no,
but she'll be here soon.

15:03.380 --> 15:04.599
Do you mind if I wait here?

15:04.642 --> 15:06.296
No, yeah, go ahead.

15:06.340 --> 15:08.037
I was thinking about
going to grab some coffees.

15:08.081 --> 15:11.562
Do you want one?
- I'm okay. Thank you.

15:11.606 --> 15:14.043
I heard about you and Jordan.

15:15.523 --> 15:18.569
Yeah, I mean,
it's kind of complicated.

15:18.613 --> 15:20.397
I know he's been
unpredictable lately

15:20.441 --> 15:21.572
and I'm sorry about that.

15:21.616 --> 15:23.705
No, it's not your fault.

15:25.794 --> 15:27.056
He's okay, though, right?

15:27.100 --> 15:28.579
I mean, there's not
something else going on

15:28.623 --> 15:30.364
that I don't know about?

15:30.407 --> 15:33.106
We've just been dealing with
some family stuff lately.

15:33.149 --> 15:35.021
Seems like every family
in Smallville

15:35.064 --> 15:38.894
is going through something so.
- That's probably true.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.940
And I just wanted to say
how impressed I am

15:40.983 --> 15:43.159
with how well you've been
handling everything.

15:43.203 --> 15:45.292
You're way more mature
than I was at that age.

15:45.335 --> 15:48.164
Thanks but that
really doesn't seem possible.

15:48.208 --> 15:49.470
You have no idea.

15:49.513 --> 15:52.125
When I was 15,
every guy I dated

15:52.168 --> 15:53.953
was just me trying
to piss off my dad

15:53.996 --> 15:55.606
and I was really good
at pissing off my dad.

15:55.650 --> 15:57.260
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

15:57.304 --> 16:01.699
There was this one guy, Dave.
He was spectacularly awful.

16:01.743 --> 16:03.310
He was in this
Primus cover band.

16:03.353 --> 16:05.094
What's Primus?

16:05.138 --> 16:07.140
A band no other band
should ever cover.

16:08.358 --> 16:10.839
I still haven't
told Clark about him.

16:10.882 --> 16:13.233
Or any other guy I dated
in high school actually.

16:13.276 --> 16:18.368
Wow, that kind of sounds
crazy coming from you.

16:18.412 --> 16:21.502
Anyway, the older you get,
the more you realize

16:21.545 --> 16:24.592
everyone is dealing
with something.

16:24.635 --> 16:27.290
Yeah.

16:27.334 --> 16:31.294
Speaking of,
what's going on with Jonathan?

16:31.338 --> 16:32.817
What do you mean?

16:32.861 --> 16:34.080
Well, when I saw him earlier,
it looked like

16:34.123 --> 16:37.300
he was going to a rave
out in "The Matrix."

16:37.344 --> 16:39.302
Where did you see him?

16:39.346 --> 16:41.130
Um...

16:41.174 --> 16:43.741
Walking on my street
as I pulled out.

16:43.785 --> 16:45.439
It looked like
he was going to Candice's.

16:45.482 --> 16:47.310
Tell your mom I dropped by.

16:47.354 --> 16:49.051
I have to go.

16:49.095 --> 16:51.010
Okay.

16:55.362 --> 16:56.667
Clark.

16:56.711 --> 16:59.018
What is it?

16:59.061 --> 17:00.671
I think the other Jonathan
has Lana.

17:00.715 --> 17:01.672
Whoa, how do you know that?

17:01.716 --> 17:02.847
Because Sarah said she saw

17:02.891 --> 17:05.067
an oddly dressed Jonathan
on her street.

17:05.111 --> 17:06.938
Why were you talking
to Sarah?

17:06.982 --> 17:08.331
Why would he want
to take Mrs. Cushing?

17:08.375 --> 17:09.637
Because on his Earth,

17:09.680 --> 17:11.160
he and Lana
work together for Ally.

17:11.204 --> 17:12.292
So wait, he thinks that

17:12.335 --> 17:13.684
Sarah's mom's gonna
help him merge?

17:13.728 --> 17:15.034
You said that
you saw him last night.

17:15.077 --> 17:16.644
Maybe he was trying
to get your attention.

17:16.687 --> 17:19.255
Wait, you saw him
and you just let him go.

17:19.299 --> 17:21.649
There wasn't anything
I could do.

17:21.692 --> 17:23.216
You're--what do you mean?
You're Superman.

17:23.259 --> 17:24.869
You could've flown over there
and stopped him.

17:24.913 --> 17:26.871
Not with Lana there.

17:26.915 --> 17:28.090
Right, right, right, right.

17:28.134 --> 17:29.787
'Cause you gotta keep
your precious secret

17:29.831 --> 17:32.181
so we can live "a normal life."
- You're serious?

17:32.225 --> 17:33.574
Why didn't you say anything
to Sarah's mom?

17:33.617 --> 17:36.446
Boys, we are not talking
about this right now!

17:36.490 --> 17:38.927
It's literally the entire
reason she's in danger.

17:38.970 --> 17:40.711
Okay, Jonathan,
I don't have time to stand here

17:40.755 --> 17:42.061
and defend
the decisions I've made.

17:42.104 --> 17:43.801
Right 'cause you never think
you're wrong.

17:43.845 --> 17:45.412
No, it's because
my best friend is in danger.

17:45.455 --> 17:47.327
Okay, well, maybe
if you didn't care so much

17:47.370 --> 17:48.545
about keeping your secret--

17:48.589 --> 17:51.374
Jonathan, upstairs right now.

17:51.418 --> 17:54.160
Clark, go find her.

17:56.031 --> 17:56.988
Jordan.

17:57.032 --> 17:58.077
Why were you talking
to Sarah?

18:02.168 --> 18:04.431
Here goes nothing.

18:08.609 --> 18:09.958
It's working.

18:13.875 --> 18:17.618
I mean, if Jon curls up
into the fetal position.

18:27.932 --> 18:30.500
We need more energy.

18:30.544 --> 18:32.459
A lot more.

18:32.502 --> 18:34.852
Where are we gonna get that?

18:34.896 --> 18:38.900
Same place we get the stuff
that powers my suit.

19:28.515 --> 19:31.170
Hey, have you seen my mom?

19:31.213 --> 19:33.215
I thought she was with you.

19:33.259 --> 19:34.825
Uh, no,
we drove here separately,

19:34.869 --> 19:37.219
but that was, like,
an hour ago.

19:37.263 --> 19:39.090
Well, she hasn't answered
any of my calls

19:39.134 --> 19:42.224
and we really need to schedule
a staff meeting.

19:42.268 --> 19:45.662
Um, maybe she just deciding
on what to bring to the office?

19:45.706 --> 19:49.057
So I'm gonna go home
and check on her.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.059
Okay.

19:52.713 --> 19:53.670
You were trying
to smooth things over.

19:53.714 --> 19:55.019
What does that even mean?

19:55.063 --> 19:57.457
It means I was trying
to give her some context

19:57.500 --> 19:59.198
about what's going on with you.

19:59.241 --> 20:01.330
I was doing that, but then
you took my phone away.

20:01.374 --> 20:03.376
Honey, I know that's
what you think you were doing,

20:03.419 --> 20:05.595
but trust me,
it's better this way.

20:05.639 --> 20:07.206
Oh, so you're allowed
to talk to her and I'm not.

20:07.249 --> 20:10.209
- That's not what I said.
- That's what you meant.

20:10.252 --> 20:12.036
Can we please
not do this right now?

20:12.080 --> 20:14.343
We have way bigger problems
on our hands.

20:14.387 --> 20:15.736
Well, Mom,
this is pretty big to me.

20:15.779 --> 20:17.390
I know, sweetheart,

20:17.433 --> 20:20.784
and I promise you,
I am on your team.

20:20.828 --> 20:21.872
Then you shouldn't
have talked to her

20:21.916 --> 20:23.874
without at least
asking me first.

20:28.052 --> 20:31.186
You're right.
I'm sorry.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.754
But there is a dangerous
version of your brother

20:33.797 --> 20:36.235
to worry about right now,
so can we please

20:36.278 --> 20:38.019
just cut each other some slack?

20:40.326 --> 20:42.284
What is it?

20:42.328 --> 20:43.764
Someone's here.

20:51.685 --> 20:54.165
I think something
might've happened to my mom.

21:00.128 --> 21:01.390
She never showed up
at the office.

21:01.434 --> 21:02.522
So I went back to the house
to look for her

21:02.565 --> 21:04.567
and she wasn't there.
I mean, Jon--

21:04.611 --> 21:08.049
Jon was in the neighborhood.
Maybe he knew where she went.

21:08.092 --> 21:09.442
I talked to him
when he got home.

21:09.485 --> 21:11.661
He said he went
straight to Candice's.

21:11.705 --> 21:13.141
It doesn't make any sense.

21:13.184 --> 21:14.795
Her car is still there
and when I went home,

21:14.838 --> 21:17.450
there was a busted cabinet
and glass all over the floor.

21:17.493 --> 21:19.103
Okay, let's not
jump to conclusions.

21:19.147 --> 21:21.062
I am sure everything is fine.
- Mom.

21:21.105 --> 21:22.629
Let me make some phone calls.

21:22.672 --> 21:25.327
I promise you,
we will find out what happened.

21:25.371 --> 21:26.894
But the best thing
for you to do right now

21:26.937 --> 21:28.939
is go back to her office
and I will reach out

21:28.983 --> 21:30.637
the moment I hear
of anything, okay?

21:30.680 --> 21:32.943
Okay.

21:32.987 --> 21:34.380
Thank you.

21:39.907 --> 21:42.126
Sarah, wait.

21:42.170 --> 21:44.128
Look, I'm sorry
for blowing up your phone.

21:44.172 --> 21:47.218
Jordan, can we--can we just
not do this right now?

21:47.262 --> 21:50.396
Wait, I know it's a bad time,
but this is important.

21:50.439 --> 21:52.093
I need to tell you
how I really feel.

21:52.136 --> 21:54.182
Jordan, my mom is missing.

21:54.225 --> 21:57.185
Look, look, instead
of stumbling over my words

21:57.228 --> 21:58.447
in a million texts...

21:58.491 --> 22:00.014
I wrote it all down.

22:00.057 --> 22:03.931
Everything I've been trying
to say to you but couldn't.

22:03.974 --> 22:05.846
It's all in here.

22:07.195 --> 22:09.893
Jordan,
I don't want your letter.

22:12.940 --> 22:19.207
<i>♪</i>

22:19.250 --> 22:21.514
I'm sorry, sweetie.

22:21.557 --> 22:23.342
Yeah, great idea.

22:42.535 --> 22:44.014
It's kind of beautiful.

22:44.058 --> 22:46.147
No, no, no.
Don't be fooled.

22:46.190 --> 22:47.409
Anyone who tries
to go in through

22:47.453 --> 22:50.020
without protection
gets torn to shreds.

22:50.064 --> 22:52.196
So what, it's like
some dimensional rift

22:52.240 --> 22:54.285
that leads to the other Earth?

22:54.329 --> 22:56.200
There's more to it than that.

22:56.244 --> 22:57.811
Clark mentioned
the middle ground,

22:57.854 --> 22:59.813
like a negative zone,

22:59.856 --> 23:02.642
completely devoid
of time and space.

23:02.685 --> 23:04.208
Sounds just like
what I was stuck in

23:04.252 --> 23:07.908
before my AI located your suit.

23:07.951 --> 23:09.910
Come on.
Let's get what we came for.

23:13.696 --> 23:15.045
Oh, no.

23:15.089 --> 23:16.351
I'm afraid that's--
that's not gonna do much.

23:16.395 --> 23:19.702
No, this stuff
is really wedged in there.

23:19.746 --> 23:23.271
So what, you created
something to get it out with?

23:23.314 --> 23:24.620
Yeah.

23:43.596 --> 23:46.686
Jonathan,
what are we doing here?

23:51.995 --> 23:54.389
Besides waiting
until it's time?

23:54.433 --> 23:57.436
You know the answer to that.

23:57.479 --> 24:00.656
That X-K you're taking
is getting to your head.

24:00.700 --> 24:02.441
You're not making any sense.

24:02.484 --> 24:03.659
You don't know
what you're talking about.

24:03.703 --> 24:06.053
I know that
you've been struggling.

24:06.096 --> 24:07.402
Got kicked out of school.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.491
That Jonathan is not me.

24:09.535 --> 24:11.406
And that your parents
are worried about you.

24:11.450 --> 24:14.627
You don't know my parents.

24:17.586 --> 24:19.196
Those people...

24:22.025 --> 24:23.723
They just look like them.

24:23.766 --> 24:27.117

looking for her mom

25:03.719 --> 25:04.938

25:04.981 --> 25:07.070

lie to her face.

everything we care about.

everything we care about.

this secret safe,

two very exceptional young men

25:38.798 --> 25:42.366
