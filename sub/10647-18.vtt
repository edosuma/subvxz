WEBVTT

00:01.827 --> 00:03.521
SPIDER-MAN: Hey, Miles,
you're really warming up

00:03.566 --> 00:05.221
to this "falling through
a wormhole" thing.

00:05.387 --> 00:07.306
There's way less screaming
in terror this time.

00:07.341 --> 00:09.809
MILES: Yeah, at first
I was all,

00:09.844 --> 00:13.112
"Ah, I'm in a wormhole!
I'm Freaking out!"

00:13.147 --> 00:14.813
Then, after a while,
you're like,

00:14.848 --> 00:17.416
(YAWNS)
"This is a long wormhole."

00:17.451 --> 00:18.665
So, what are we doing here?

00:18.710 --> 00:21.820
It all started when a mystical gem
called the Siege Perilous was shattered,

00:21.855 --> 00:23.956
<i>scattering pieces
across various dimensions.</i>

00:23.991 --> 00:25.624
Now, those pieces are
coming back together,

00:25.659 --> 00:27.459
and drawing all the different
Universes with them

00:27.494 --> 00:29.695
on a collision course.
And that's bad.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.664
<i>Like, end of all reality bad.</i>

00:31.699 --> 00:33.632
<i>So, we're racing through all
the alternate dimensions</i>

00:33.667 --> 00:37.136
<i>to gather the shards
and save the Universes.</i>

00:37.171 --> 00:38.504
<i>And to make things worse,</i>

00:38.539 --> 00:40.273
<i>there's some creep called
the Wolf Spider out there</i>

00:40.318 --> 00:42.008
<i>trying to gather
the fragments, too.</i>

00:42.043 --> 00:44.309
<i>I don't know why, but 
I'm not looking to find out.</i>

00:49.382 --> 00:51.017
(YELLING)

00:51.052 --> 00:52.584
Whoa! (GRUNTS)

00:52.619 --> 00:54.487
(SCREAMS)

00:54.522 --> 00:56.722
Hey, I've been here before.

00:56.757 --> 00:57.990
(GRUNTS)

00:58.725 --> 00:59.892
MILES: Wow!

00:59.927 --> 01:03.229
This place is,
like, retro-cool.

01:03.264 --> 01:04.730
What's the deal
with the colors?

01:04.765 --> 01:07.233
Think of this world
like an old movie.

01:07.268 --> 01:09.168
The Spider-Man here
is a friend. He'll help us.

01:09.203 --> 01:12.404
I hope so. This place
seems kinda dangerous.

01:12.439 --> 01:13.939
Like, for example...

01:18.360 --> 01:21.509
(GUNS COCKING)

01:22.282 --> 01:23.649
(TYRES SCREECHING)

Light 'em up, boys.

01:33.127 --> 01:34.593
You got it, Hammerhead.

01:35.728 --> 01:37.096
Aah!

01:41.434 --> 01:44.203
(GRUNTING)

01:44.238 --> 01:46.238
Let me guess.
He didn't signal?

01:46.273 --> 01:48.774
I've heard of road rage,
but this is outta hand.

01:48.809 --> 01:51.210
Spider? That you?

01:51.245 --> 01:52.878
With a sidekick?

01:52.913 --> 01:54.046
Sidekick?

01:54.081 --> 01:55.247
(GRUNTS)

01:55.282 --> 01:57.950
Oh, I'll give
you a side-kick.

01:59.252 --> 02:00.219
(GRUNTS)

02:00.254 --> 02:01.286
(GRUNTS)

02:04.991 --> 02:08.794
Hey, you two look kinda familiar, 
but totally different.

02:08.829 --> 02:12.565
We look different,
says the guy in the tights.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.867
Allow us to
introduce ourselves.

02:14.902 --> 02:16.969
The name's Thunderbolt,
bug-man.

02:17.004 --> 02:19.038
And this here's Jonesy.

02:19.073 --> 02:20.806
How many times
do I gotta tell ya?

02:20.841 --> 02:24.276
Call me the A-Bombardier.
(LAUGHS)

02:24.311 --> 02:25.177
Shut up.

02:27.647 --> 02:30.316
(GROANS)
(GRUNTS)

02:30.351 --> 02:32.618
Whoa, slow down.
We came to stop this fight.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.353
Put those weapons away.

02:34.388 --> 02:35.481
(ROARS)

02:37.357 --> 02:40.626
Nobody tells Mr. Fix-It's
gang what to do.

02:41.862 --> 02:44.263

Um, Spidey, was there a Hulk
the last time you were here?

03:01.915 --> 03:04.349
No, and he's never been
a gangster before.

03:04.384 --> 03:05.951
So, we might be
in trouble.

03:05.986 --> 03:08.954
You and your gang
are through, Freak.

03:08.989 --> 03:11.790
This territory belongs
to Hammerhead now.

03:11.825 --> 03:15.127
Yeah? Your goons are no match
for us, flat-head.

03:15.162 --> 03:17.696

get plugged, but good.

A dirt nap.

03:35.282 --> 03:37.716

03:37.751 --> 03:40.319
Enough! This neighborhood
is full of innocent people.

03:41.355 --> 03:43.388

Whoa!
Hey!

What just happened?

03:48.362 --> 03:50.129
You're welcome.

03:50.164 --> 03:52.798
You, I know.
You, I'm not so sure.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.533
You remember Miles.
He came with you

03:54.568 --> 03:56.235
in that whole
Goblin portal thing.

03:56.270 --> 03:58.403
Oh, yeah. I tried
to forget that.

04:02.309 --> 04:03.751
(CONTINUOUS GUNFIRE)

04:03.876 --> 04:05.244
Thanks for the
assist, Spider.

04:05.279 --> 04:07.346
Now, let's go
stop that battle!

04:07.381 --> 04:09.348
Stop it?
You flipped your wig?

04:09.383 --> 04:11.350
- They're doing us a favor.
- Say what?

04:11.385 --> 04:15.054
Fix and Hammerhead and their gangs are 
just crooks bleeding this town dry.

04:15.089 --> 04:16.521
If they finish each other off,

04:16.555 --> 04:18.223
they'll be doing
our jobs for us.

04:18.257 --> 04:20.726
Okay, Mr. Negative.
That's pretty bleak.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.328
That's not what heroes do.

04:22.363 --> 04:23.762
He's got a point,
Spidey.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.364
We're just here for
the shard, really.

04:25.399 --> 04:26.798
You're supposed
to be on my side.

04:26.833 --> 04:28.267
The kid's smart.

04:28.302 --> 04:30.702
The war between these two
has been raging for weeks,

04:30.737 --> 04:32.537
throwing this whole town
into chaos.

04:32.572 --> 04:35.374
I say we let 'em end each other,
once and for all.

04:35.409 --> 04:38.043
I won't just stand around here
while they destroy the city.

anywhere, Pal.

could be used for more than this.

I pay you to
make weapons, Marty.

at stake now than just a gang war.

05:54.488 --> 05:56.288

is formidable.

05:56.323 --> 05:58.757
You have no idea.
The shard powering that thing

is what's crashing all

my city is in danger.

agree on something.

with the place.

09:19.125 --> 09:20.692
Like he says,
this gangster

09:20.727 --> 09:22.561
isn't much more
than a monster.

calling "monster"?

Besides, I know you're
not a monster.

09:32.872 --> 09:34.540
Hey, ask Mary Jane.

09:34.575 --> 09:37.742
She'll agree. She always
sees the best in people.

09:37.777 --> 09:40.579
Not anymore.
She's gone.

09:40.614 --> 09:42.347
I don't understand.
What happen...

09:42.382 --> 09:44.650
Ask your friend.
He did it.

09:44.685 --> 09:45.917
I don't know what
you're talking about.

09:45.952 --> 09:48.487

09:51.725 --> 09:52.991
Can it.

09:53.026 --> 09:55.527
(SCOFFS) You wouldn't
believe me anyway.

09:55.562 --> 09:58.196
You just think I'm a...
What I am.

09:58.231 --> 09:59.864
And that ain't
ever gonna change.

09:59.899 --> 10:02.200
You're wrong.
Things can change.

10:02.235 --> 10:04.135
What we need right now
is some positivity.

10:12.878 --> 10:15.714
You had your chance,
New York.

10:15.749 --> 10:20.385
Now, you belong
to Mr. Negative!

10:20.420 --> 10:22.721
(SIRENS WAILING)

10:22.756 --> 10:24.956
Mr. N, the Coppers!

10:24.991 --> 10:26.758
(TYRES SCREECH)

10:26.793 --> 10:28.627
What do we do?

10:28.662 --> 10:31.329
Time to light
up this town!

10:34.166 --> 10:35.800
No!
Aah!

10:36.802 --> 10:38.737
VOICE: A powerful weapon...
Huh?

10:40.239 --> 10:42.274
Used to be
only one Spider.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.275
Then today,
two more show up.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.544
Now you.

10:45.579 --> 10:46.811
It's getting too crowded.

10:46.846 --> 10:48.614
I'm not with them.

10:48.649 --> 10:50.115
And if you join me,

10:50.150 --> 10:53.151
I will grant you
unimaginable power.

10:53.186 --> 10:55.320
Just give me that shard.

10:55.355 --> 10:59.324
This little sparkly
gives me all the power I need.

10:59.359 --> 11:03.662
What I really want
is less spiders.

11:03.697 --> 11:05.263
(GRUNTS)

11:05.298 --> 11:07.265
Short-sighted fool!

11:07.300 --> 11:10.669
(YELLING) There are
other shards to find!

11:13.706 --> 11:15.007
I don't get it.

11:15.042 --> 11:17.309
Martin Li was always
chump change.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.844
How'd that cut ice
turn him into a somebody?

11:19.879 --> 11:22.014
That "cut ice" isn't
from this world.

11:22.049 --> 11:24.549
It's a part of a crystal
called the Siege Perilous.

11:24.584 --> 11:26.652
Like this one.

11:26.687 --> 11:29.888
I'm guessing the shard's acting 
like a Quantum Photonic lens,

11:29.923 --> 11:31.289
absorbing light and color

11:31.324 --> 11:33.725
and turning it into dark
energy that feeds Negative.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.194
Yeah, that cleared it up,
egg-head.

11:36.229 --> 11:39.998
He means that creep's using
the crystal in his hand like an energy sponge.

11:40.033 --> 11:43.201
Told ya you should have
let me smash him when
we had the chance.

11:43.236 --> 11:45.103
For once,
I agree with you.

11:45.138 --> 11:47.172
And if it destroyed you
in the process,

11:47.207 --> 11:48.807
we'd be rid
of two monsters...

11:48.842 --> 11:50.742
Him and you.

11:50.777 --> 11:52.444
(GROWLS)

11:52.479 --> 11:55.847

to call me that!

slugging the wrong guy.

I sure hope the Spider puts
an end to that Fix-It guy.

12:38.425 --> 12:41.126
That'll get us nowhere.
We should be working with Fix-It.

12:41.161 --> 12:42.994
Why? He's just a goon.

12:43.029 --> 12:44.563
He's more than that.

12:44.598 --> 12:46.931
Hammerhead didn't care
what happened to his people.

12:46.966 --> 12:50.769
But Fix-It refused to leave his friends
 unless he knew we'd go back for them.

12:50.804 --> 12:54.506
That kind of loyalty?
That sounds like our world's Hulk.

12:54.541 --> 12:55.807
I know there's good in him.

12:55.842 --> 12:58.443
So, why are good guys
fighting good guys?

12:58.478 --> 13:00.879
Just seems like how things
are done in this world.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.113

you're on the same side

13:46.392 --> 13:48.693
Only way we 86 Mr. Negative

is to gum ourselves
together, see?

You two couldn't stop fighting, 
and now we've lost Miles.

Maybe now you know
how I felt,

15:08.408 --> 15:10.542
losing Thunderbolt
and A-Bombardier.

15:10.577 --> 15:13.912
There he goes, pretending to care 
about anyone other than himself.

15:13.947 --> 15:16.081
Why should I trust him?

15:16.116 --> 15:19.083
In my Universe, Fix-It is
a hero called the Hulk.

15:19.118 --> 15:21.552
Looks just like him,
only greener.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.054
What's "green"?

15:23.089 --> 15:26.257
The point is, the Hulk
is one of the bravest
heroes I've ever known.

15:26.292 --> 15:27.759
People treat him
like a monster,

15:27.794 --> 15:29.727

and again to help others.

Mr. Negative is together.

forget what happened to MJ.

wasn't his fault.

to believe that?

Maybe if I'd been
a better guy,

16:36.663 --> 16:38.329
I wouldn't have been
so quick to misjudge you,

16:43.203 --> 16:45.070
What's the plan?
We'll never get close

16:45.105 --> 16:46.804
if we try to take
the fight to him.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.107
We have to bring him to us.

17:33.552 --> 17:36.354
I still don't
get this plan.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.957
It's simple. The only way
to stop Mr. Negative

17:38.992 --> 17:41.325
is to get the shard
of the Siege Perilous
back from him.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.028
And the only way
to do that

17:43.063 --> 17:44.929
is to get him to use up
all the power he's absorbed.

17:44.964 --> 17:47.065
What if he gets his hands
on your shard

17:47.100 --> 17:49.167
and absorbs us
in the process?

17:49.202 --> 17:50.902
Why do you have to be
so negative?

17:50.937 --> 17:52.703
How about,
"Great idea, Spidey"?

17:52.738 --> 17:55.039

ain't a great idea.
