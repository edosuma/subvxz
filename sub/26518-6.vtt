WEBVTT

00:01.251 --> 00:02.461
Where is it?

00:02.461 --> 00:04.504
Please, please, I swear,
there's no recording.

00:04.504 --> 00:05.505
I'll do whatever you want.

00:05.505 --> 00:06.506
Where is it, Justin?!

00:09.218 --> 00:11.053
Please.
Don't do this.

00:11.053 --> 00:13.263
(silenced gunshot,
Justin grunts)

00:24.441 --> 00:26.109
Oh, my God.

00:31.740 --> 00:34.117
Shepherd's holding cell
is straight ahead.

00:34.117 --> 00:35.702
I got the security cams
on a loop

00:35.702 --> 00:37.454
so you can make your way
through the building undetected.

00:37.454 --> 00:39.289
But as soon as
the code breaker's activated,

00:39.289 --> 00:41.250
it triggers the alarm.

00:41.250 --> 00:42.376
You'll be shooting
your way out.

00:42.376 --> 00:45.295
Very aware. We're here.

00:49.341 --> 00:50.425
Code breaker's on the lock.

00:50.425 --> 00:52.177
60 seconds
to crack the password.

00:52.177 --> 00:53.720
Good luck, Remi.

00:58.767 --> 00:59.518
Uhh!

00:59.518 --> 01:00.519
Stay in formation!

01:00.519 --> 01:02.437
Uhh!

01:02.437 --> 01:03.438
40 seconds.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.235
One number left.

01:14.199 --> 01:17.119
♪♪

01:21.123 --> 01:23.250
Damn it!

01:23.250 --> 01:24.835
Reset,
let's run it again.

01:24.835 --> 01:27.254
No, we have run it
100 times already.

01:27.254 --> 01:28.630
It doesn't work.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.882
I'm sick of getting hit
with these rubber bullets.

01:30.882 --> 01:33.719
How does the last number
take 40 seconds, Violet?

01:33.719 --> 01:36.096
It doesn't, it's verifying
all the other numbers.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.639
Yeah, well,
your code breaker sucks.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.391
You knew the deal-- this
was the best one we could get

01:39.391 --> 01:40.809
with the time frame
you gave me.

01:40.809 --> 01:42.602
You want the better one?
It'll take three months.

01:44.229 --> 01:45.897
It looks like Jane's
ZIP poisoning

01:45.897 --> 01:47.149
is worse than we thought.

01:47.149 --> 01:49.109
It's killing you.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.611
I don't have
three months.

01:51.611 --> 01:53.071
So, what are we
gonna do?

01:53.071 --> 01:54.239
I'm gonna go.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.366
And you are
gonna problem-solve.

01:56.366 --> 01:58.910
I hired you to get us
into that cell

01:58.910 --> 02:00.912
without getting me killed.

02:00.912 --> 02:04.207
(code breaker chirping,
buzzer sounding)

02:04.207 --> 02:07.127
Fix it today.

02:12.883 --> 02:13.967
Good morning.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.802
Hi.
How was your run?

02:15.802 --> 02:18.430
It was good.

02:20.057 --> 02:22.184
Mm. Mmm!

02:22.184 --> 02:24.394
Next time, why don't
you wake me up?

02:24.394 --> 02:25.896
I'll come with you.

02:25.896 --> 02:27.314
Oh, I like to keep
a good pace.

02:27.314 --> 02:28.690
I could outrun you any day.

02:28.690 --> 02:31.234
Keep telling yourself that.

02:31.234 --> 02:33.028
I'm gonna go grab
a shower.

02:36.948 --> 02:38.408
I already looked
into Violet.

02:38.408 --> 02:39.868
She's the queen
of the black market.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.912
She can get you anything
for the right price.

02:45.332 --> 02:47.334
Hey, everyone.
Sorry I'm late.

02:47.334 --> 02:50.087
The shower in the gym
just took forever to get hot.

02:50.087 --> 02:51.588
Has it always been
like that?

02:51.588 --> 02:53.006
What is the point
of coming in early

02:53.006 --> 02:54.633
if the shower's
gonna make you late?

02:54.633 --> 02:57.177
Ahem.
Yeah, let's get started.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.220
We're here to talk about

02:58.220 --> 03:00.430
the security breach
the other day.

03:03.225 --> 03:04.309
What do you want?

03:04.309 --> 03:07.187
Just your access
to the FBI servers.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.480
Download's almost finished.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.649
So, Edgar,
why don't you...

03:10.649 --> 03:12.150
you know,
in your own words.

03:12.150 --> 03:14.319
Uh, sorry, perhaps there's
been a misunderstanding.

03:14.319 --> 03:17.280
Is the CIA really expected
to sit here quietly nodding

03:17.280 --> 03:18.532
while the FBI conducts

03:18.532 --> 03:20.492
an interrogation
of their own agent?

03:20.492 --> 03:23.286
Clearly, there has been
a misunderstanding,

03:23.286 --> 03:26.289
because this is a debrief
and not an interrogation.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.375
Edgar Reade isn't an agent,

03:28.375 --> 03:30.293
he's an assistant director
of the FBI.

03:30.293 --> 03:32.170
We're aware of his title.

03:32.170 --> 03:35.465
Tasha Zapata couldn't have
stolen 50 secret files

03:35.465 --> 03:40.303
from the FBI server without
his hardwired personal access.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.890
Let's take a quick recess.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.475
This is a waste
of our time.

03:51.064 --> 03:54.192
So... I used
to be in politics,

03:54.192 --> 03:56.361
and I make an effort
to know people.

03:56.361 --> 03:58.405
I knew everyone
in this meeting

03:58.405 --> 03:59.489
except for you.

03:59.489 --> 04:01.533
I was expecting the head
of the CIA here,

04:01.533 --> 04:03.702
and instead, you are.

04:03.702 --> 04:05.537
Well, the director
is very busy.

04:05.537 --> 04:06.997
Who are you?

04:06.997 --> 04:09.666
Sabrina Larren, I work
directly for the director.

04:09.666 --> 04:10.834
Indirectly.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.627
I'll be taking over
for Jake Keaton

04:12.627 --> 04:15.172
since he's...
unfit for duty.

04:15.172 --> 04:16.131
Keaton is not unfit,

04:16.131 --> 04:18.216
he's in
a medically-induced coma

04:18.216 --> 04:20.844
because he risked his life
saving members of this team.

04:20.844 --> 04:24.055
Keaton clearly held
an affinity for Zapata

04:24.055 --> 04:28.477
and this team as a whole...
that's become problematic.

04:28.477 --> 04:30.395
Luckily, that's not
an affliction I share.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.898
I talk to Reade alone

04:32.898 --> 04:35.650
or I expand the parameters
of my investigation

04:35.650 --> 04:38.987
to include... well, you.

04:38.987 --> 04:41.823
You think Reade's
the only one culpable here?

04:42.908 --> 04:45.911
I'll give you the room.

04:45.911 --> 04:48.955
Oh, I don't need a big,
fancy conference table.

04:48.955 --> 04:51.583
Any old interrogation room
will do.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.586
Whatever you need.

04:56.630 --> 05:00.008
This is Adam Booth,
head engineer

05:00.008 --> 05:02.219
at Bradley Dynamics,
London office.

05:02.219 --> 05:05.430
And based on
the FBI file you stole,

05:05.430 --> 05:08.308
I think our best shot at
infiltrating Project Arvo.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.809
Never heard of it.

05:09.809 --> 05:11.645
Neither had I,
but Booth required

05:11.645 --> 05:13.230
an FBI background check
to work on it.

05:13.230 --> 05:16.399
Bradley Dynamics is pouring
a fortune into it,

05:16.399 --> 05:20.028
and I think Project Arvo
is gonna save my company.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.531
How? You don't even
know what it is.

05:22.531 --> 05:24.574
Well...

05:24.574 --> 05:28.745
Hank Crawford,
in his infinite wisdom,

05:28.745 --> 05:32.040
left us $40 billion
in debt.

05:32.040 --> 05:35.585
Now, all that oil pipeline,
one-world army nonsense

05:35.585 --> 05:37.128
had us leveraged
to the hilt.

05:37.128 --> 05:39.422
So, we need a cash infusion,
and we need a big one.

05:39.422 --> 05:41.091
Or a government bailout.

05:41.091 --> 05:43.760
Well, you're joking,
but that's precisely the plan.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.596
Bradley Dynamics
is our main competition

05:46.596 --> 05:48.473
in an upcoming
defense contract

05:48.473 --> 05:49.808
worth billions.

05:49.808 --> 05:51.601
But if we can make
Project Arvo

05:51.601 --> 05:55.730
an abject failure and publicly
disgrace Bradley Dynamics...

05:55.730 --> 05:58.024
HCI Global swoops in
and takes the win.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.776
What exactly
do you need me to do?

05:59.776 --> 06:02.821
Go to London,
find out about Project Arvo.

06:02.821 --> 06:04.614
Have some fun.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.283
Consider it done.

06:10.453 --> 06:11.871
What do you got?

06:11.871 --> 06:13.081
New York Congressman
Justin Trimble

06:13.081 --> 06:14.249
was murdered this morning.

06:14.249 --> 06:15.458
It hasn't been
reported yet,

06:15.458 --> 06:17.544
but the preliminary
crime scene photos

06:17.544 --> 06:19.087
triggered the tattoo
database.

06:19.087 --> 06:21.715
It appears that before
he died, he wrote this

06:21.715 --> 06:23.383
in his own blood.
"GPA"?

06:23.383 --> 06:25.385
But I thought we already
unlocked this tattoo.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.970
It was the flag one, right?
We did.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.847
Uh, I did.
Uh, not a competition.

06:28.847 --> 06:30.515
Funny how you only
say that when I'm winning.

06:30.515 --> 06:32.642
Anyhoo, let's take a look
at Old Glory here.

06:32.642 --> 06:35.520
The fourth star, red,
second star, white,

06:35.520 --> 06:36.813
49th star, blue.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.898
That's Georgia,
Pennsylvania, and Alaska.

06:38.898 --> 06:41.568
Add that to the first letter
indicator on the flagstaff,

06:41.568 --> 06:44.195
and we get GPA.

06:44.195 --> 06:45.822
But connections to those
letters are multiple--

06:45.822 --> 06:49.659
about 52 million results
per .52 seconds,

06:49.659 --> 06:51.911
so effectively meaningless.
Until now.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.913
With this new political angle,
we are confident

06:53.913 --> 06:55.665
that the tattoo
is pointing to

06:55.665 --> 06:57.542
Growth and Prosperity
for America.

06:57.542 --> 07:00.170
The lobbying group.
No, the lobbying group.

07:00.170 --> 07:02.130
GPA is the largest
outside spender

07:02.130 --> 07:04.132
in federal elections
and state initiatives.

07:04.132 --> 07:07.218
Last year in New York alone,
they gave $13 million

07:07.218 --> 07:08.928
to individual
congressional candidates.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.597
Here's the kicker--
you'll never guess

07:10.597 --> 07:11.681
who one of those
candidates was.

07:11.681 --> 07:13.850
Matthew Weitz.

07:15.018 --> 07:16.645
Of course I took
money from GPA.

07:16.645 --> 07:18.313
That's how politics works!

07:18.313 --> 07:20.148
Yeah, so what
was the money for?

07:20.148 --> 07:22.275
Winning.
Lobbyists give money,

07:22.275 --> 07:24.319
politicians vote
for things lobbyists want.

07:24.319 --> 07:27.072
Or, in my case,
my own independent ideals

07:27.072 --> 07:28.990
which happened to line up
with what lobbyists want.

07:28.990 --> 07:31.326
What do you know about
Congressman Justin Trimble?

07:31.326 --> 07:32.661
Why?

07:32.661 --> 07:33.870
His name came up
in connection

07:33.870 --> 07:35.538
with the tattoo case
involving GPA.

07:35.538 --> 07:37.666
Well, I don't him that well.
What's the connection?

07:37.666 --> 07:39.668
He was murdered
in his home this morning.

07:39.668 --> 07:41.670
Wrote "GPA"
in his own blood.

07:41.670 --> 07:43.171
I'm sorry to hear that.

07:43.171 --> 07:44.506
So, you don't know anything

07:44.506 --> 07:45.799
that could help us
with this case?

07:45.799 --> 07:47.258
Not that I'm aware of.

07:47.258 --> 07:48.760
When was the last time
you spoke to Justin?

07:48.760 --> 07:50.887
Months. Years.
I don't recall.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.347
Now, if this interrogation
is over,

07:52.347 --> 07:53.682
I'm gonna
check on Reade's.

07:53.682 --> 07:55.225
Excuse me.

07:55.225 --> 07:57.018
Weitz is lying.

07:57.018 --> 07:58.687
Justin texted him
yesterday.

07:58.687 --> 08:00.355
Are you sure?
100%.

08:00.355 --> 08:02.148
I dug into the deleted data
on Justin's phone.

08:02.148 --> 08:05.151
He was using a texting app
called "TextandFly."

08:05.151 --> 08:06.861
It's basically
Snapchat for messaging.

08:06.861 --> 08:08.154
You send a text,
it deletes,

08:08.154 --> 08:09.572
and it doesn't save
to your phone.

08:09.572 --> 08:11.282
So, I called a friend at
TextandFly Headquarters

08:11.282 --> 08:13.618
in Silicon Valley.
Humble brag.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.704
No, that's a brag-brag.
I know people.

08:15.704 --> 08:18.498
And I recovered Justin's texts
from their servers.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.667
See, they say they don't
keep them, but they do.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.711
You really gotta read
the privacy policies
very carefully.

08:22.711 --> 08:24.170
What did
Justin's text say?

08:24.170 --> 08:25.797
"Need to meet. ASAP."

08:25.797 --> 08:27.716
Did Weitz reply?

08:27.716 --> 08:28.967
Sort of.
He liked the text,

08:28.967 --> 08:30.927
and then Justin
texted again.

08:30.927 --> 08:33.471
"8:30, Soho."
Weitz also liked that one.

08:33.471 --> 08:35.515
He's a very efficient
communicator.
Where in Soho?

08:35.515 --> 08:38.268
Not Soho, the neighborhood.
The Soho House in Brooklyn.

08:38.268 --> 08:40.687
Justin checked into
the members-only club

08:40.687 --> 08:42.731
last night with
an unnamed plus-one.

08:42.731 --> 08:46.192
Weitz.
He could have been the last
person to see Justin alive.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.736
Why is he lying?
Why is he saying

08:47.736 --> 08:49.654
he hasn't seen him in years?
You don't think that--

08:49.654 --> 08:52.699
Yes, I do. It seems like
the director of the FBI

08:52.699 --> 08:54.409
is trying to
cover up a murder.

08:54.409 --> 08:56.745
♪♪

09:08.798 --> 09:10.216
This is unreal.

09:10.216 --> 09:11.551
First we're digging into Hirst.
And now Weitz?

09:11.551 --> 09:13.762
How deep do we think
Weitz's connection goes

09:13.762 --> 09:15.555
to the congressman's murder?

09:15.555 --> 09:17.432
I mean, do you really think
he's capable of killing a guy?

09:17.432 --> 09:19.559
No. He showed up early
for work today,

09:19.559 --> 09:21.686
so given the timeline,
he couldn't have done that.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.563
But he's definitely
hiding something.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.398
Okay, so just on a scale
of one to ten,

09:25.398 --> 09:27.567
how close are we
to building a secret SIOC

09:27.567 --> 09:29.027
in your apartment--
like a five?

09:29.027 --> 09:30.487
Even if he didn't
kill Justin,

09:30.487 --> 09:32.071
it doesn't mean
he didn't order the hit,

09:32.071 --> 09:34.991
and it doesn't mean he isn't
part of a larger conspiracy.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.993
I'm hearing, like, six, seven.
When we get to eight, nine,

09:36.993 --> 09:38.661
let me know, I'll start
building the shadow lab.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.830
I should probably give back
the keys to your apartment.
No.

09:40.830 --> 09:43.291
Jane and I will head to the
crime scene, see if we can find

09:43.291 --> 09:45.210
any connections that
NYPD might have missed.

09:45.210 --> 09:46.711
Okay, we'll dig into GPA

09:46.711 --> 09:49.672
and, obviously, make sure
none of this gets back to Weitz.

09:54.385 --> 09:56.805
Is it possible
she was the masked woman

09:56.805 --> 09:58.765
from the break
Yes, it's possible.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.892
Like I said,
she was wearing a mask.

10:00.892 --> 10:02.477
This is Claudia Murphy.

10:02.477 --> 10:04.771
My intel suggests
she was the other woman

10:04.771 --> 10:06.272
in your apartment.

10:06.272 --> 10:09.859
My intel also suggests
that Claudia is MI6.

10:09.859 --> 10:12.278
My contacts
at MI6 are suggesting

10:12.278 --> 10:14.864
that Claudia is missing,
presumed dead.

10:16.199 --> 10:17.784
And what are you
suggesting?

10:17.784 --> 10:20.328
I guess I'm just curious
what you think of that.

10:20.328 --> 10:21.913
How you think
that might have happened.

10:21.913 --> 10:24.833
Well, if Claudia is dead,

10:24.833 --> 10:27.126
it might be because she
pointed her pistol at Zapata.

10:27.126 --> 10:28.878
That's not something
you can do to Zapata

10:28.878 --> 10:30.004
without consequence.

10:30.004 --> 10:32.632
Well, that certainly
changes things.

10:32.632 --> 10:33.716
How so?

10:33.716 --> 10:35.468
Well, when this
manhunt started,

10:35.468 --> 10:38.263
Zapata was simply
an embarrassment
to the agency.

10:38.263 --> 10:41.933
But now, she could be
out there killing MI6 agents?

10:41.933 --> 10:44.352
That can't happen.

10:44.352 --> 10:46.604
We have to bring her in now.

10:46.604 --> 10:47.939
That's what we've been
trying to do.

10:47.939 --> 10:49.899
Dead or alive.

10:49.899 --> 10:52.318
Is that gonna be
a problem for you?

10:52.318 --> 10:55.822
I only ask because
you and Zapata have...

10:55.822 --> 10:56.990
a history.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.741
Had history.

10:58.741 --> 11:01.411
And no, it's not a problem.

11:02.537 --> 11:04.163
I don't like
this Weitz thing.

11:04.163 --> 11:05.748
Yeah, me neither.
I've never trusted him.

11:05.748 --> 11:07.625
No, that's not what--
I'm saying I don't buy it.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.627
Okay, look, I mean,
he stuck his neck out for us

11:09.627 --> 11:12.255
with the NYPD, with the whole
bomb in the train thing.

11:12.255 --> 11:14.132
Just devil's advocate,
tell me one nefarious thing

11:14.132 --> 11:15.466
that we actually know
that he's done.

11:15.466 --> 11:18.636
Uh, he lied to us about
talking to Justin.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.847
Did he, though?
I mean, technically,
they were texting,

11:20.847 --> 11:22.307
which is not a verbal
communication.

11:22.307 --> 11:23.850
Ergo, that's not talking.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.059
Not if they spoke
at the Soho House.

11:25.059 --> 11:26.311
Yeah, but how do we know
they did?

11:26.311 --> 11:27.604
What if he just
showed up there

11:27.604 --> 11:28.855
and just listened
the whole time?

11:28.855 --> 11:29.898
How do we know
he was even there?

11:29.898 --> 11:31.858
We don't.
I mean, technically,

11:31.858 --> 11:33.985
is liking a text
even texting?

11:33.985 --> 11:35.236
He just clicked like.
Devil's advocate.

11:35.236 --> 11:37.280
I'm not gonna argue
semantics with you.

11:37.280 --> 11:40.825
Weitz said that he didn't
know Justin very well,

11:40.825 --> 11:43.161
and he downplayed
his connection to GPA.

11:43.161 --> 11:46.789
Yet, here is a picture
of Justin and Weitz

11:46.789 --> 11:49.208
celebrating at a GPA
lobbying event,

11:49.208 --> 11:51.878
because GPA funded
their campaigns, bigly!

11:51.878 --> 11:55.131
Yeah, but that's just the way
politics works in this country.

11:55.131 --> 11:56.758
Look, I know that the role
of FBI Director

11:56.758 --> 11:58.760
has been a little "Defense
Against the Dark Arts"

11:58.760 --> 12:00.970
around here lately,
but it makes no sense

12:00.970 --> 12:02.639
for Weitz to be working
against us.

12:02.639 --> 12:05.683
That's career suicide,
and Weitz loves his career.

12:05.683 --> 12:07.685
I'm just saying--
devil's advocate.

12:07.685 --> 12:11.314
I don't know that's he done
anything remotely suspicious.

12:12.607 --> 12:14.442
Uh, Weitz just pushed
all of his meetings,

12:14.442 --> 12:16.653
and a driver is outside
to pick him up.

12:16.653 --> 12:19.697
Sure, that's a little
suspicious, yeah.

12:20.782 --> 12:21.866
Okay.

12:21.866 --> 12:24.077
That was Rich
and Patterson.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.328
Weitz is on the move.

12:25.328 --> 12:26.913
They tracking him?

12:26.913 --> 12:28.289
Yeah, they are.

12:28.289 --> 12:29.374
Did you find anything?

12:29.374 --> 12:30.959
This place is pretty trashed.

12:30.959 --> 12:34.003
Justin's killer is definitely
looking for something.

12:38.424 --> 12:39.759
What?

12:39.759 --> 12:41.427
Nothing.

12:43.846 --> 12:46.349
Whatever Weitz was into,

12:46.349 --> 12:49.686
his biggest mistake
was lying about it.

12:50.937 --> 12:52.605
How do you figure?

12:54.148 --> 12:57.443
The worst part
isn't getting caught.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.654
It's waiting to be caught.

12:59.654 --> 13:01.948
We're just looking into him
'cause he was lying.

13:01.948 --> 13:04.367
So whatever secrets
he's hiding,

13:04.367 --> 13:06.077
they make him a suspect.

13:06.077 --> 13:08.955
Well, he's allowed
to have secrets.

13:08.955 --> 13:12.458
People don't have to tell
everything to everyone.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.043
No.

13:14.043 --> 13:16.170
But when they don't,

13:16.170 --> 13:18.548
and we know
something's wrong...

13:20.675 --> 13:23.344
...it's kinda hard
not to imagine the worst.

13:23.344 --> 13:26.931
He should have trusted us
and told us the truth.

13:31.519 --> 13:36.149
Hey, this fuse box
has a switch labeled 4.0.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.276
As in Grade Point Average.

13:38.276 --> 13:40.570
GPA.
That can't be a coincidence.

13:54.083 --> 13:58.046
"Yes" on 8818,
or we release the tapes.

13:58.046 --> 14:00.131
Do you want the world
to know what kind of man
you really are?

14:00.131 --> 14:01.507
It's a blackmail scheme.

14:01.507 --> 14:02.925
Justin was being
leveraged,

14:02.925 --> 14:04.594
so he started recording
his phone conversations.

14:04.594 --> 14:06.429
Think about it, Justin--
your career over,

14:06.429 --> 14:08.014
your family
destroyed, for what?

14:08.014 --> 14:09.682
All we're asking for
is loyalty.

14:09.682 --> 14:12.101
I've been loyal
to GPA for years.

14:12.101 --> 14:17.690
I voted "yes" on 1020,
846, 6414, 8221,

14:17.690 --> 14:20.693
9871, just like GPA asked.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.945
He's trying to get confirmation
that GPA's behind this,

14:22.945 --> 14:24.238
but he's pushing too hard.

14:24.238 --> 14:25.656
Why did you say that, Justin?

14:25.656 --> 14:27.200
Don't answer that,
Justin, don't you dare.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.659
You think I don't know
what's going on?

14:28.659 --> 14:30.078
I could have told anyone

14:30.078 --> 14:31.621
who GPA really is at any time.

14:31.621 --> 14:33.122
Are you recording
this conversation?

14:33.122 --> 14:34.290
Say no.
Justin, say no!

14:34.290 --> 14:36.209
Rich!
You know how this ends.
Okay.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.044
No, of course not.
You think I'm crazy?

14:38.044 --> 14:40.088
Refusing to vote
our way is crazy.

14:40.088 --> 14:43.049
Recording this conversation
is a death wish,

14:43.049 --> 14:44.425
for you and the others.

14:44.425 --> 14:46.677
Well, I guess we know
why they killed him.

14:46.677 --> 14:49.097
The voice mentioned others.
What others?

14:49.097 --> 14:51.307
More congresspeople?
More whistleblowers?

14:51.307 --> 14:52.725
We better find out fast.

14:52.725 --> 14:56.229
If we don't, a whole lot
of people are gonna die.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.694
GPA's motive makes sense.

15:03.694 --> 15:05.947
Kill a whistleblower
to avoid exposure.

15:05.947 --> 15:08.449
Only question is,
other than Justin,

15:08.449 --> 15:09.909
who else is being leveraged?

15:09.909 --> 15:11.452
Yeah, and who's
the GPA's next target?

15:11.452 --> 15:12.829
I say that we follow
the money and the votes.

15:12.829 --> 15:14.247
I've got
the congressional bills

15:14.247 --> 15:16.124
Justin mentioned
in his recordings.

15:16.124 --> 15:18.209
And I've got a list of
all the reps who voted "yes"

15:18.209 --> 15:19.377
on each of them.
It is a long list.

15:19.377 --> 15:21.379
Spoiler alert--
GPA basically runs Congress.

15:21.379 --> 15:22.922
Well, not when we're done
with 'em.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.507
Weitz just arrived
at his destination.

15:24.507 --> 15:26.509
It's house in Westchester.
He really made good time.

15:26.509 --> 15:28.094
Usually traffic
up there is killer.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.846
Bad choice of words,
I'm sorry.
Whose house?

15:29.846 --> 15:33.015
Frank Davenport, congressman
of New York's 17th District.

15:33.015 --> 15:34.642
Yeah, Davenport's
on our list.

15:34.642 --> 15:35.977
He is third in line
for the Speaker of the House

15:35.977 --> 15:38.604
and a major recipient
of GPA funding.

15:38.604 --> 15:41.357
What in the hell
is Weitz doing?

15:50.658 --> 15:52.368
We need to talk
about GPA.

15:52.368 --> 15:54.162
You can't be here
right now, Matthew.

15:54.162 --> 15:56.164
I can, and I am.

15:56.164 --> 15:57.790
I'm in the middle
of a meeting.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.709
I have people
upstairs in my office.

15:59.709 --> 16:02.879
And I'm the director
of the FBI, Frank.

16:07.717 --> 16:10.428
Don't forget
who got you that job.

16:10.428 --> 16:11.971
And that's why
I came alone,

16:11.971 --> 16:14.182
as a courtesy
for old-time's sake.

16:16.142 --> 16:17.852
Justin Trimble reached out
to me yesterday,

16:17.852 --> 16:20.271
said he had some interesting
things to say about GPA--

16:20.271 --> 16:21.314
that they were
blackmailing him

16:21.314 --> 16:22.982
and that he wasn't
the only one.

16:22.982 --> 16:26.110
When I asked him for proof,
he showed up dead.

16:26.110 --> 16:28.362
GPA is your
biggest donor, Frank.

16:28.362 --> 16:30.114
It is a matter
of public record

16:30.114 --> 16:32.074
that you and Justin voted
exactly the same

16:32.074 --> 16:34.076
on every bill GPA supported.

16:34.076 --> 16:38.289
So... are you compromised?

16:39.415 --> 16:41.375
You need to leave this alone.

16:41.375 --> 16:43.920
You don't know
who you're dealing with.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.130
Well, who am I
dealing with?

16:46.130 --> 16:48.883
Matthew, please,
let it go.

16:48.883 --> 16:52.345
If you keep looking into GPA,
it could be bad for you, too.

16:52.345 --> 16:55.181
Bad like it was
for Justin?

16:55.181 --> 16:56.891
Think about this.

16:56.891 --> 16:58.976
Now, GPA has something
on everyone.

16:58.976 --> 17:03.314
So, for my sake
and your sake...

17:03.314 --> 17:05.524
let it go.

17:05.524 --> 17:08.903
Are you asking me
to bury this, Frank?

17:08.903 --> 17:12.198
I'm asking you
to be a friend.

17:20.414 --> 17:22.500
Hey, I think we got something.
Yeah, us too.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.168
You wanna go first?
No, you guys go.

17:24.168 --> 17:26.003
Oh, we always go first.
You seem so excited.

17:26.003 --> 17:30.049
Someone go first.
This whole conspiracy
is about China.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.260
That's exactly
what we had.
Oh yeah, sure, likely story.

17:32.260 --> 17:34.220
We should have
gone first.
Look, can we just have a look

17:34.220 --> 17:36.472
at the flag tattoo again?
Oh, yeah, okay.

17:36.472 --> 17:41.185
See that outline?
That is the same shape
as the Yangtze River.

17:41.185 --> 17:42.311
Roman was telling us

17:42.311 --> 17:44.355
our country has been
infiltrated by China.

17:44.355 --> 17:46.107
I can't believe
we missed this.
Hey, don't blame yourself.

17:46.107 --> 17:47.191
I'm not.
I'm blaming both of us.

17:47.191 --> 17:48.859
What did you have?

17:48.859 --> 17:51.862
Ours is a little less visual,
a little less obvious.

17:51.862 --> 17:53.197
These bills
are incredibly dense,

17:53.197 --> 17:55.741
and China's involvement
with GPA

17:55.741 --> 17:57.618
is buried in shell companies.

17:57.618 --> 17:58.911
Basically, GPA is trying
to strip away

17:58.911 --> 18:00.538
sanctions on China
and protections

18:00.538 --> 18:03.791
against Chinese tech companies
entering the U.S. marketplace.

18:03.791 --> 18:07.128
This whole thing
is about 5G technology.

18:07.128 --> 18:08.212
Why is that a big deal?

18:08.212 --> 18:10.172
5G is basically
the new space race.

18:10.172 --> 18:12.216
It's actually like more
an arms race.

18:12.216 --> 18:14.844
Imagine if Japan had
the A-bomb before we did.

18:14.844 --> 18:16.345
Except the weapon
is the Internet

18:16.345 --> 18:18.347
and everybody's cell phones.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.266
It sounds a little goofy
when you say it like that.

18:20.266 --> 18:22.184
Okay, look, it cannot
all be armed nukes

18:22.184 --> 18:23.644
falling out of airplanes,
all right?

18:23.644 --> 18:25.688
This is an ongoing
insidious threat.

18:25.688 --> 18:27.315
China will own us.

18:27.315 --> 18:28.316
They already own us.

18:28.316 --> 18:30.568
They own GPA,
and GPA owns Congress.

18:30.568 --> 18:32.361
What is Weitz's connection
to all this?

18:32.361 --> 18:34.238
Stop what you're doing
right now!

18:34.238 --> 18:35.656
Are you kidding me?

18:35.656 --> 18:37.158
I've been defending you all day.
You're shutting us down?

18:37.158 --> 18:40.119
I'm... wait, what are
you doing right now?

18:40.119 --> 18:41.495
Solving the murder
of your friend Justin

18:41.495 --> 18:42.580
and uncovering
a political conspiracy

18:42.580 --> 18:44.290
of international magnitude.

18:44.290 --> 18:46.417
What are you doing
right now?
Oh, um...

18:46.417 --> 18:48.044
Okay, there's been
a misunderstanding.

18:48.044 --> 18:50.671
I thought you guy...
I'm working on the same case.

18:50.671 --> 18:52.631
So, that's why you went
to see Frank Davenport?

18:52.631 --> 18:54.383
Uh... don't love that
you tracked me,

18:54.383 --> 18:55.968
but we have
bigger fish to fry.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.387
GPA has been bribing
congresspeople,

18:58.387 --> 18:59.889
and I think
they killed Justin.

18:59.889 --> 19:02.266
I looked into their
voting history.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.393
I think China's behind it.

19:04.393 --> 19:05.478
We know.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.938
Well, that's deflating.

19:07.938 --> 19:09.565
I drove to Westchester
for nothing?

19:09.565 --> 19:12.109
Let's go back. I want
to clarify something.

19:12.109 --> 19:14.403
You're sure Claudia
said "JB"?

19:14.403 --> 19:16.322
We have two hours.
Or what?

19:16.322 --> 19:17.365
Or JB goes ahead
without us.

19:17.365 --> 19:20.242
Yes.
Any idea who JB is?

19:20.242 --> 19:21.369
Yeah, we have some leads.

19:21.369 --> 19:23.287
Uh, James Bond,
Jack Bauer,

19:23.287 --> 19:25.748
Justin Bieber,
Jim Beam, Jim Brown.

19:25.748 --> 19:27.500
A little premature
to be making jokes.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.667
Look, I told you.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.294
I got knocked out
and I came to

19:30.294 --> 19:31.587
before Zapata and Claudia
could realize,

19:31.587 --> 19:33.047
so I played possum.

19:33.047 --> 19:35.591
I heard Claudia say,
"or JB will go without us."

19:35.591 --> 19:37.093
That's all I heard.
Next thing you know,

19:37.093 --> 19:38.511
they're waking me up
with ammonia.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.513
And that's when you gave
Zapata the password

19:40.513 --> 19:42.348
to your computer.

19:42.348 --> 19:43.933
Am I a suspect?

19:43.933 --> 19:45.726
Because this little chat
is taking a very long time.

19:45.726 --> 19:48.854
Were you hacked?
Were you tortured?

19:48.854 --> 19:51.148
Did they put a gun
to your head?

19:51.148 --> 19:53.818
Look, I wanna know how
she got into your computer,

19:53.818 --> 19:55.611
and I'm having a hard time

19:55.611 --> 19:58.114
reconciling everyone's
motivations.

19:58.114 --> 20:00.366
If you don't want your
girlfriend's brains on you,

20:00.366 --> 20:02.076
you'll give me that code.

20:02.076 --> 20:04.870
I mean...
you can be honest, Edgar.

20:04.870 --> 20:07.373
It's not a crime
to have feelings

20:07.373 --> 20:08.374
for a former teammate.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.292
We live
in a gray world.

20:13.462 --> 20:14.380
No.

20:14.380 --> 20:16.966
There wasn't a gun on me.

20:16.966 --> 20:19.677
Claudia pointed
her gun at Zapata...

20:19.677 --> 20:21.679
I didn't want anyone to die,

20:21.679 --> 20:24.014
so I just gave Zapata
my password.

20:24.014 --> 20:26.392
Thank you.

20:26.392 --> 20:29.562
In the end, it's our honesty
that protects us.

20:53.419 --> 20:56.297
So, you think Frank Davenport
is being blackmailed too?

20:56.297 --> 20:57.506
He basically admitted it.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.467
So, why'd you lie to us?
'Cause he's my friend,

20:59.467 --> 21:01.552
and I thought he was
in trouble.

21:01.552 --> 21:02.636
Oh, what,
you four Mouseketeers

21:02.636 --> 21:03.971
never lied to protect
a friend?

Why didn't you
just bring him in,

21:07.391 --> 21:09.643
put a detail on him?
There was too much
that could go wrong.

21:09.643 --> 21:11.395
Frank was in danger
just from me being there.

21:11.395 --> 21:13.189
Justin was killed
for meeting with me.

21:13.189 --> 21:15.399
Justin was killed because
he slipped up on getting proof.

21:15.399 --> 21:17.776
He pushed the blackmailers
too hard and too soon.

21:17.776 --> 21:20.446
Because I asked him to.
He didn't wanna do it.

21:20.446 --> 21:22.573
Justin and another
congresswoman from New York,

21:22.573 --> 21:24.074
they wanted to come clean,
but I told them

21:24.074 --> 21:25.493
I couldn't investigate
without evidence.

21:25.493 --> 21:26.452
Whoa, back it up.

There's no case
without a tape.

21:27.953 --> 21:29.663
W-what do you mean,
other congresswoman?

21:29.663 --> 21:31.040
I don't know.
Justin never told me her name.

21:31.040 --> 21:32.666
He was trying
to protect her.

21:32.666 --> 21:33.876
Oh, I-- I get it.

21:33.876 --> 21:35.169
Congresswoman,
right, right.

There's 27 congressional seats
in New York,

21:37.004 --> 21:38.797
nine are held by woman.

21:38.797 --> 21:41.217
Two of those women are major
recipients of GPA money.

Elaine Bell, boom.

matches Davenport's

21:44.261 --> 21:45.846
and Trimble's exactly.

21:45.846 --> 21:47.765
Okay, I am now deeply ensconced
in Elaine Bell's personal life.

21:47.765 --> 21:49.934
Hang on-- she booked
a vacation earlier today.

21:49.934 --> 21:51.560
Yeah, but she only booked
three tickets to Florida.

She's flying to DC tonight

"Budget meeting,

21:56.440 --> 21:58.400
House subcommittee
on fisheries and forests."

22:24.468 --> 22:26.387
Elaine's in critical condition.
She's in surgery now.

22:26.387 --> 22:28.138
What is this? I told you
to come up with a list
of potential targets.

22:28.138 --> 22:30.349
That's it.
But there's 100
names up there!

22:30.349 --> 22:33.561
These are the Reps
that are taking legitimate
donations from GPA,

22:33.561 --> 22:35.396
ranked from highest amount
to lowest.

22:35.396 --> 22:36.981
Any of 'em could be
potential whistleblowers

22:36.981 --> 22:38.941
that want to expose GPA.

22:38.941 --> 22:41.318
We gotta narrow it down.
Lives are in danger, people.

22:41.318 --> 22:43.487
Well, we got Justin
Trimble near the top,

22:43.487 --> 22:46.657
Elaine Bell near the
bottom, and Davenport
right in the middle.

22:46.657 --> 22:49.201
It is impossible to tell
who's being blackmailed
and who isn't,

22:49.201 --> 22:51.287
which is likely the point.
We're out of time.

22:51.287 --> 22:53.289
I mean, we can't just keep
investigating under the radar.

22:53.289 --> 22:55.249
I just email blasted every
field office in the country

22:55.249 --> 22:56.625

every name on this list

22:56.625 --> 22:58.294
into protective
custody immediately.

22:59.920 --> 23:02.548
Sick.
Jane and I will head
to the hospital.

23:02.548 --> 23:04.049
Elaine'll be
out of surgery soon.

23:04.049 --> 23:05.551
She could possibly
ID the shooter.

23:05.551 --> 23:06.927
Maybe she'll know
who's pulling the strings

23:06.927 --> 23:08.679
for the Chinese
inside GPA.

23:08.679 --> 23:10.681

No. Protective custody.

23:21.191 --> 23:24.445
Hopefully, I'll get him
to talk to us before a long
car ride changes his mind.

termination followed by
a formal investigation

23:48.093 --> 23:50.262

Yeah. I'd always
choose the truth.

all the good times?

What were you
doing in here, Jane?

39:47.343 --> 39:49.304
Gotta say I didn't love
your exit line.

39:49.304 --> 39:51.347
My what?
You know, put the badge
on the table and go like,

39:51.347 --> 39:52.390
"You're a snake."

39:52.390 --> 39:53.891
I don't know,
it was kind of a...

39:53.891 --> 39:56.144
I was expecting a little bit
more from you, I guess.

39:56.144 --> 39:57.520
You're only fired
on paper, by the way.

39:57.520 --> 39:59.188
Here's your gun back.

39:59.188 --> 40:01.649
If we're going after Zapata,
I need Larren and the CIA

40:01.649 --> 40:02.859
to think
that we dropped it.

40:02.859 --> 40:04.402
You mean all that stuff
you said about me

40:04.402 --> 40:06.195
being emotionally
compromised and unreliable--

40:06.195 --> 40:08.948
Plausible deniability.
A little smokescreen
to buy us some time.

40:08.948 --> 40:10.074
Time for what?

40:10.074 --> 40:11.659
Larren is gunning
for Zapata now,

40:11.659 --> 40:13.995
which means we only
have a couple days
to get in front of it

40:13.995 --> 40:15.913
and bring this whole mess
to a close.

40:15.913 --> 40:17.373
"We"

40:17.373 --> 40:19.500
Yeah... I don't know
when it happened,

40:19.500 --> 40:21.544
but I got a real affinity
for this team.

40:21.544 --> 40:22.879
Kinda snuck up on me.

40:22.879 --> 40:25.965
And I'm taking the Zapata
betrayal very personally.

40:25.965 --> 40:27.925
Perhaps...
the most personally.

40:27.925 --> 40:29.594
Oh, I seriously
doubt that.

40:29.594 --> 40:31.137
Also, I'm being really good
at reading between the lines,

40:31.137 --> 40:33.473
and when the CIA says
they wanna bring Zapata in

40:33.473 --> 40:35.058
"dead or alive"...

40:35.058 --> 40:37.602
there's a real good chance
they just mean "dead."

40:40.188 --> 40:42.190
So what do you
got to eat?

40:42.190 --> 40:43.983
I'm vegan right now.
But like...

40:43.983 --> 40:45.860
also, not really.

40:51.741 --> 40:54.327
What in the hell are you
thinking calling this number?

40:54.327 --> 40:55.828
I'm sorry, I didn't know
what else to do.

40:55.828 --> 40:57.372
Some guy was snooping
around the warehouse.

40:57.372 --> 40:58.915
Who?
I don't know.

40:58.915 --> 41:00.500
But he had "Fed"
written all over him.

41:00.500 --> 41:03.044
We're burned.
We need to go dark-- now.

41:03.044 --> 41:06.255
I'll send you coordinates.
Wait for me there!

41:19.602 --> 41:21.104
You feeling better?

41:21.104 --> 41:22.397
Yeah.

41:22.397 --> 41:24.732
I'm gonna...
go to the gym.

41:24.732 --> 41:26.859
I just went
to the warehouse.

41:28.736 --> 41:30.238
I put a tracker on you, Jane.

41:32.782 --> 41:34.909
You're spying on me.

41:34.909 --> 41:37.787
You've been lying to me.

41:37.787 --> 41:40.665
Your friend Violet...

41:40.665 --> 41:42.417
she just tried
to kill me.

41:42.417 --> 41:44.127
What?

41:44.127 --> 41:45.169
God.

41:45.169 --> 41:47.213
Kurt...
are you okay?

41:52.468 --> 41:56.097
No... I'm not.
