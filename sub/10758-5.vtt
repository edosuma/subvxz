00:09.090 --> 00:13.136
Dr. Crane, I just wanted to tell you
how much I miss your show.

00:13.302 --> 00:16.097
Oh, well, thank you so much.
I miss it too.

00:16.305 --> 00:17.640
Yes, the brisk exchange of ideas,

00:17.807 --> 00:20.685
the crackling interplay
between me and my callers.

00:25.398 --> 00:26.440
Well, you're very kind.

00:28.568 --> 00:31.070
See that, Roz? The public
still craves the kind of excitement

00:31.237 --> 00:32.947
that only Frasier Crane can provide.

00:34.282 --> 00:36.200
Roz!

00:37.827 --> 00:39.287
I am so sorry.

00:39.495 --> 00:41.455
The baby kept me up
all night long last night.

00:41.622 --> 00:46.210
I'm trying to get her used to her crib,
but she just hates to sleep alone.

00:46.419 --> 00:48.421
Well, the acorn certainly
doesn't fall far from...

00:48.587 --> 00:52.466
I have got to wake up.
I'm on my way to an interview.

00:52.633 --> 00:56.220
I'd kill for a cup of regular coffee,
but I'm still nursing, so I can't.

00:56.387 --> 00:58.889
You know, it was just all I could do
to get myself dressed

00:59.056 --> 01:00.808
and then feed the baby
this morning.

01:01.016 --> 01:02.059
Yes, well, next time,

01:02.226 --> 01:04.769
maybe you should try feeding first
and dressing second.

01:04.937 --> 01:06.397
- Oh, my God!
- Yes.

01:06.564 --> 01:09.108
- How did I miss this?
- Well...

01:09.275 --> 01:12.611
On the plus side, it does divert the eye
from the blueberries in your teeth.

01:12.778 --> 01:15.072
What? I can't go
to this interview like this.

01:15.239 --> 01:17.741
- Of course you can.
- Oh, I'm just gonna call and cancel.

01:17.908 --> 01:20.661
No, Roz, no, please, just check
your teeth, yes, put your jacket on,

01:20.869 --> 01:24.456
and I swear, you'll look every inch
the smart career gal on the go.

01:24.665 --> 01:25.708
- There.
- Thanks, Frasier.

01:25.874 --> 01:28.460
Hey, Roz. Is that the newest thing,
wearing two different shoes?

01:28.627 --> 01:31.130
Oh, my God!

01:31.922 --> 01:33.882
Hi, Dad. So, what brings you here?

01:34.049 --> 01:35.968
Well, I thought you needed
a little cheering up.

01:36.135 --> 01:37.469
You've been kind of mopey lately.

01:37.636 --> 01:40.681
Well, I had kind of a rough night
at the wine club.

01:40.889 --> 01:42.891
During the blindfolded tasting,

01:43.058 --> 01:46.436
I gave four stars
to a Mexican Zinfandel.

01:47.271 --> 01:48.689
Well, I don't just mean last night.

01:48.856 --> 01:51.900
I mean, you've been kind of down ever
since you lost your job, you know?

01:52.067 --> 01:54.653
And you haven't had a date
in I don't know how long.

01:54.861 --> 01:57.114
I know how long,
and this isn't the way to cheer me up.

01:57.281 --> 01:58.824
Don't worry. I found a girl for you.

01:58.991 --> 02:01.076
Now, Duke's daughter Marie
just moved back in town...

02:01.243 --> 02:03.870
Dad, blind dates remain
the refuge of the lovelorn.

02:04.079 --> 02:07.040
If you didn't talk like that, you might
not have to get set up so much.

02:07.457 --> 02:09.918
Now, listen, she's not a blind date.
You know Marie.

02:10.085 --> 02:13.088
- Spent a week with her at the lake.
- She was 6 years old!

02:13.296 --> 02:14.965
Duke said she's grown
into a real looker.

02:15.132 --> 02:16.466
Yes, well, I have seen Duke.

02:16.675 --> 02:19.010
And unless he sired a love child
with Catherine Deneuve,

02:19.177 --> 02:21.221
I don't like my odds.

02:22.180 --> 02:24.599
- Uncle Martin!
- Oh, Marie!

02:24.766 --> 02:28.061
Look at you. You remember Frasier?

02:28.270 --> 02:29.396
<i>Bonjour!</i>

02:37.278 --> 02:39.531
I don't know when I've had
such a delicious meal.

02:39.698 --> 02:41.324
You really made this dessert
yourself?

02:41.491 --> 02:46.371
Well, yes. It's a little something
I like to call Crane brûlée.

02:48.289 --> 02:49.833
You always were a gourmet.

02:50.041 --> 02:51.876
Even at the lake,
whenever we had fish sticks,

02:52.043 --> 02:54.295
you insisted on white grape juice.

02:58.299 --> 03:00.385
Is everything all right there?

03:02.470 --> 03:04.264
It's just a little quirk of mine.

03:04.430 --> 03:07.725
I like to keep things straight,
you know, in parallel lines.

03:07.892 --> 03:10.478
Yes, I noticed that earlier
with the asparagus.

03:12.563 --> 03:15.024
It's weird, I know.
It used to drive my mother crazy.

03:15.233 --> 03:17.402
Well, you know, we all have
our little idiosyncrasies.

03:17.568 --> 03:19.654
- How is your mother, anyway?
- Still on my case.

03:19.821 --> 03:23.574
After the divorce,
things just got worse.

03:27.578 --> 03:32.250
Oh, I'm doing it again, aren't I?
I'm sorry. I'll stop.

03:32.834 --> 03:34.460
Look.

03:36.003 --> 03:39.173
Anyway, I haven't figured out how
to have a normal relationship with her.

03:39.382 --> 03:43.177
You know, we're all striving to have
what we call "normal" relationships.

03:43.344 --> 03:45.096
But who really knows
what normal is?

03:45.304 --> 03:48.349
- You can move it back now.
- Thank you.

03:49.809 --> 03:51.936
What do you say we have our wine
out on the balcony?

03:52.520 --> 03:53.729
- The balcony?
- Yes.

03:53.938 --> 03:56.482
You haven't had a chance
to see the view.

03:57.483 --> 04:02.446
Wow! That is some view, all right.
Beautiful.

04:03.364 --> 04:07.076
- You're afraid of heights, aren't you?
- I'm taking classes.

04:08.035 --> 04:09.495
They give us these exercises to do.

04:09.662 --> 04:13.457
They just work better when
you're standing on a little milk crate.

04:14.875 --> 04:18.045
Oh, I must seem totally neurotic.

04:18.254 --> 04:20.172
Not at all.

04:20.673 --> 04:23.175
I guess I'm going a little nuts
since I moved in with my dad.

04:23.342 --> 04:25.177
Thank God,
I'm getting my own place next week.

04:25.386 --> 04:27.513
Oh, yes, well,
I suspect that will help a lot.

04:27.680 --> 04:29.640
You know, very often,
the key to mental health

04:29.807 --> 04:32.226
is distancing ourselves
from our parents.

04:32.434 --> 04:34.770
I'm home. Oh, hey!

04:37.981 --> 04:39.233
Sorry to barge in on you kids.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.485
That's all right.
Why don't you join us for dessert?

04:41.693 --> 04:45.864
Oh, thanks anyway,
but I had Crane brûlée for lunch.

04:47.199 --> 04:48.450
I did a little dry run earlier.

04:48.617 --> 04:51.286
I wanted to make sure my carameliser
wasn't on the fritz.

04:51.495 --> 04:53.830
I was proud the first time
he brought that blowtorch home

04:53.997 --> 04:55.791
- until I saw what it was for.
- Dad!

04:55.958 --> 04:59.294
Oh, no, I'm only joking.
She knows that.

04:59.461 --> 05:01.171
He's a great kid, Marie.

05:01.338 --> 05:05.175
I mean, sure, he's out of work now,
but he's hit the skids a lot of times,

05:05.384 --> 05:08.595
and he always manages
to bounce right back up.

05:08.804 --> 05:11.348
I think you've sprinkled enough
pixie dust for one evening.

05:11.556 --> 05:13.308
Okay. Okay.

05:14.059 --> 05:15.560
Well, good night, you two.

05:15.769 --> 05:19.272
- I should probably get going too.
- All right.

05:19.439 --> 05:21.483
Thank you for a great evening.

05:21.650 --> 05:24.569
And for all the wonderful advice.
It was very insightful.

05:24.778 --> 05:26.655
You're quite welcome, Marie.

05:26.822 --> 05:32.452
Perhaps you can offer me
a little insight as well.

05:33.036 --> 05:36.539
Will this be our only night together
or will I see you again?

05:36.748 --> 05:39.042
Well, you're pretty good
at interpreting things.

05:39.209 --> 05:41.044
Maybe this will answer
your question.

05:43.000 --> 05:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:54.641 --> 05:56.309
Well, then, you have a nice life.

06:00.855 --> 06:05.109
And just as this hunter catches up
to me and is about to kill me,

06:05.318 --> 06:08.988
I wake up on the cot in my dad's
oak-panelled rumpus room.

06:09.197 --> 06:12.617
That is a terrifying nightmare.

06:12.867 --> 06:14.786
Are there any other figures
in the rumpus room?

06:14.994 --> 06:18.456
No, that's not part of the dream.
I really sleep there.

06:19.457 --> 06:22.543
I wish I didn't have to go. Can we talk
about this after the museum tonight?

06:22.752 --> 06:24.754
Oh, of course.
I thought it was the opera tonight.

06:24.921 --> 06:26.047
No, the museum opening.

06:26.214 --> 06:28.383
You promised me in the shower
this morning, remember?

06:28.549 --> 06:29.967
Yes.

06:30.510 --> 06:32.595
But I was under duress.
You had a loofah to my head.

06:39.936 --> 06:41.979
Oh, Niles,
you just missed Duke's daughter.

06:42.146 --> 06:43.648
I saw!

06:43.856 --> 06:45.566
Is it possible that's the same little girl

06:45.733 --> 06:47.443
we used to refer to as
"The Ugly Dukeling"?

06:51.656 --> 06:53.824
- She is stunning.
- Isn't she, though?

06:54.033 --> 06:55.534
You know, the insecure part of me

06:55.701 --> 06:57.870
has trouble figuring out
why she's going out with me.

06:58.037 --> 07:00.498
I mean,
she could have her pick of men.

07:01.165 --> 07:04.001
And I am a little older, haven't been
to the gym as often as I should,

07:04.168 --> 07:07.254
and you can feel free to contradict me
anytime you like, Niles.

07:07.588 --> 07:10.091
You must have something,
because she's clearly charmed by you.

07:10.257 --> 07:11.509
Yes, well, whatever the reason,

07:11.675 --> 07:14.428
we certainly have
the most wonderful time together.

07:14.637 --> 07:15.971
We have the greatest discussions.

07:16.138 --> 07:18.307
I've been helping her sort
through some of her issues.

07:18.474 --> 07:19.642
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

07:19.850 --> 07:21.936
It's a very complex relationship
with her mother

07:22.102 --> 07:26.106
which has given rise to several striking
phobias and a recurring dream.

07:26.273 --> 07:29.526
And the most charming little
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

07:30.152 --> 07:32.196
Oh, well, then, there you go.

07:32.655 --> 07:36.116
Perhaps she's attracted to you
because of your psychiatric expertise.

07:36.825 --> 07:38.327
Well, what are you suggesting,
Niles?

07:38.494 --> 07:40.788
That Marie's going out with me
just to get free therapy?

07:40.996 --> 07:43.916
- Well, it was just a thought.
- That's a mean-spirited thought.

07:44.124 --> 07:45.334
Marie's not using me.

07:45.501 --> 07:48.212
She would want me just as much
even if I weren't a psychiatrist.

07:48.420 --> 07:50.672
Why, you're jealous.
You're jealous that I'm having sex.

07:50.881 --> 07:53.300
Jealous that I'm having hot,
passionate, sweaty, jungle sex.

07:53.467 --> 07:55.344
What are you having?

07:58.263 --> 08:00.140
I'm having a latte.

08:05.270 --> 08:06.897
Will this be all right for you?

08:07.064 --> 08:09.066
Is there enough light here
for you to see her?

08:09.274 --> 08:11.902
Yeah, I'm telling you, Phil,
she's really cute.

08:12.069 --> 08:14.488
You'll see for yourself
in a couple of minutes.

08:14.655 --> 08:17.657
Oh, wait. She's coming in now.
I gotta go.

08:20.494 --> 08:22.245
- Hey, Daphne, how's it going?
- Fine.

08:22.412 --> 08:24.247
- Good.
- What are you so chipper about?

08:24.456 --> 08:27.125
Oh, nothing. It's a beautiful night out.

08:27.292 --> 08:29.961
Say, why don't you come out and
have a look at the moon with me?

08:30.170 --> 08:33.465
- Why, is it full?
- I don't know.

08:34.006 --> 08:35.967
All right.

08:39.721 --> 08:43.515
- It's a beaut, isn't it?
- Oh, yeah, very romantic.

08:43.725 --> 08:45.352
Now, wait! Wait!
Come here, come here.

08:45.518 --> 08:47.395
I gotta show you something else too.
Over here.

08:48.021 --> 08:51.983
Look at that, the way the moonbeams
bounce off that reflecting pool.

08:52.150 --> 08:55.945
Oh, yeah, that's really something.

08:59.199 --> 09:00.742
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

09:00.909 --> 09:02.077
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

09:02.243 --> 09:03.411
- Yes, you are.
- I'm not.

09:03.578 --> 09:04.746
You're signalling to someone.

09:05.413 --> 09:08.041
Well, all right.
I did such a good job with Frasier,

09:08.208 --> 09:10.502
I thought maybe I could fix you up
with some nice guy.

09:11.252 --> 09:13.087
Is it that man up there
with the binoculars?

09:13.254 --> 09:14.631
Yeah, isn't that a great building?

09:14.797 --> 09:16.507
He does real well.
He owns half that floor.

09:16.674 --> 09:18.134
- Mr. Crane!
- What?

09:18.343 --> 09:19.385
I don't believe it!

09:19.552 --> 09:21.429
Putting me on display,
like a bloody concubine!

09:21.596 --> 09:22.847
Well, you get a turn too.

09:23.014 --> 09:26.726
I got this telescope set up
so you could have a look at him.

09:26.893 --> 09:29.520
See, he liked you. Hello?

09:29.687 --> 09:32.940
Yeah, well, I told you she was pretty.

09:33.107 --> 09:34.942
What do you mean,
can I show you another one?

09:35.109 --> 09:37.612
What do you think I'm running here?

09:37.820 --> 09:40.698
So there I am,
actually biting the fingernails

09:40.865 --> 09:42.617
of the same hand
that's holding the phone,

09:42.784 --> 09:45.119
not two minutes after
I'm on with my mother.

09:45.286 --> 09:50.082
- Isn't that so revealing?
- Well, yes. Yes, I'd say it is.

09:50.541 --> 09:53.336
Is everything okay, Frasier?
You seem a little quiet.

09:53.878 --> 09:57.590
No, no, I was just so enjoying
our museum chat,

09:57.757 --> 10:01.260
I was wondering how we got on
to the subject of mothers.

10:01.761 --> 10:04.722
Well, it was a Whistler exhibit.

10:06.766 --> 10:10.478
Yes, yes, I'm sorry.
I guess I'm just a bit tense.

10:10.644 --> 10:13.147
Why didn't you say something?
I'll give you a little massage.

10:13.314 --> 10:15.775
Oh, really? Well, all right,
if you think that'll help.

10:18.110 --> 10:22.156
It's such an amazing feeling, being
in the presence of so much beauty.

10:22.364 --> 10:23.657
Yes, well, you say that now.

10:23.824 --> 10:26.493
In six weeks,
you'll be telling me to lose weight.

10:29.955 --> 10:32.249
The Whistler, I know, I know.

10:32.416 --> 10:34.543
Gosh, isn't it great
that we both enjoy art so much?

10:34.710 --> 10:38.339
- I could just talk about it all night.
- Me too.

10:38.672 --> 10:42.926
Oh, you know, I couldn't help noticing
your staring at that riverscape.

10:43.093 --> 10:44.636
You couldn't take your eyes off of it.

10:44.803 --> 10:48.682
Yeah, I think it's because it
reminded me of my recurring dream.

10:48.849 --> 10:51.435
You know, we were gonna talk
more about that.

10:51.602 --> 10:57.274
Oh, yes, yes. The dream, being
pursued by the hunter and the arrows.

10:57.441 --> 11:00.569
- Yeah.
- Well...

11:00.736 --> 11:04.281
You know, I'm not really feeling up
to talking about it right now.

11:04.448 --> 11:06.325
Do you think we could do it
some other night?

11:07.743 --> 11:09.536
All right.

11:12.664 --> 11:14.166
What did you think
of the riverscape?

11:14.791 --> 11:16.752
Oh, well, I enjoyed it.

11:16.918 --> 11:19.588
I was also enjoying
what you were doing just now.

11:19.796 --> 11:23.050
I'm sorry. My hands were just
getting a little bit of a cramp.

11:23.258 --> 11:24.676
Oh, well, then let me do you, then.

11:24.843 --> 11:27.846
Oh, actually, it's getting late.
You know, maybe I should get home.

11:28.055 --> 11:29.473
Thought you were
spending the night.

11:29.639 --> 11:32.684
Oh, I'd like to, but I have
an early morning and I hate to rush.

11:33.435 --> 11:34.644
I had a great evening tonight.

11:34.811 --> 11:39.566
You know, about that dream,
I did have one thought.

11:39.774 --> 11:41.651
- Really?
- Yes.

11:41.860 --> 11:48.241
Forest imagery very often represents
our most primal emotions,

11:48.450 --> 11:50.827
hence its frequent use in fairy tales,

11:51.036 --> 11:53.204
which could be a link
to your childhood.

11:54.122 --> 11:58.460
You are so good at this.
Much better than my therapist.

11:58.626 --> 12:02.213
- You have a therapist?
- Oh, not anymore. Who can afford it?

12:04.340 --> 12:06.468
Anyway, you know,
my hands are feeling much better.

12:06.634 --> 12:08.386
Why don't we give that massage
another shot?

12:08.553 --> 12:09.929
Oh, yeah.

12:10.096 --> 12:15.059
So I noticed that I often have this
dream right after I talk to my mother.

12:15.226 --> 12:20.231
Boy, your muscles are so tense.
Is it just your neck or all over?

12:20.398 --> 12:22.775
It's all over.

12:27.697 --> 12:31.034
Frasier, Frasier,
you will not believe this.

12:31.200 --> 12:33.995
Little Alice said her first word today.
It was "ma."

12:34.203 --> 12:35.246
Or it may have been "moo."

12:35.413 --> 12:37.790
Mary, that's the sitter,
gave her this little toy cow.

12:37.999 --> 12:40.251
She's always doing stuff like that.
I love Mary.

12:40.418 --> 12:42.503
I love this little cow too.

12:42.670 --> 12:44.714
It's the cutest little thing.
It's brown and white.

12:44.881 --> 12:47.383
That's a Jersey cow, right?
That's where Mary's from, Jersey.

12:47.550 --> 12:50.261
Yeah! I'll take a splash more.

12:51.179 --> 12:54.473
You know, I stopped nursing yesterday
and, boy, have I missed this stuff.

12:54.682 --> 12:56.475
Cup of mud, java, my old friend joe.

12:56.642 --> 12:58.394
That's funny,
Mary's husband's name is Joe.

12:58.561 --> 13:01.147
Oh, my God, he's picking her up.
I gotta go. This has been fun.

13:01.314 --> 13:03.733
You look great.
Nice talking with you.

13:09.447 --> 13:12.074
- Frasier, may I join you?
- Well, of course, Niles.

13:12.241 --> 13:14.493
And I'm sorry about yesterday.

13:14.660 --> 13:16.495
No, no, I'm the one
who should be apologizing.

13:16.662 --> 13:18.581
I never meant to suggest
that Marie was...

13:18.748 --> 13:21.584
Niles, Marie and I broke up.

13:22.376 --> 13:25.379
I'm sorry.
Did she at least give you a reason?

13:26.005 --> 13:29.717
I broke up with her, but thank you for
the daily shot in the arm of confidence.

13:29.925 --> 13:32.511
I talked to Duke. What the hell
did you break up with Marie for?

13:32.678 --> 13:34.597
I'm terribly sorry.
I don't mean to cause a rift

13:34.763 --> 13:37.266
between you and your friend,
but I couldn't continue with it.

13:37.433 --> 13:40.144
You see, once I confirmed that Marie
was primarily interested in me

13:40.311 --> 13:43.689
as a sounding board for her problems,
I just had to end it.

13:43.897 --> 13:45.399
Just as Niles suggested I should.

13:46.317 --> 13:48.193
I never suggested that!

13:48.360 --> 13:51.113
Well, no, all I said
was that one of the things

13:51.280 --> 13:53.907
she might appreciate about you
is your psychiatric expertise.

13:54.116 --> 13:57.077
If you were a world-class chef,
she'd appreciate your cooking.

13:57.244 --> 13:59.747
If you were a stand-up comedian,
she'd appreciate your jokes.

13:59.913 --> 14:02.916
If you were a dermatologist, she had
a big growth coming out of her face...

14:03.125 --> 14:04.585
Yes, Dad, I get it. Thank you.

14:05.627 --> 14:08.130
I am sorry, but if you had let
the relationship continue,

14:08.297 --> 14:09.840
she might have found other things

14:10.007 --> 14:12.175
that she'd appreciate about you
just as much.

14:12.384 --> 14:14.052
Maybe there's still time
to win her back.

14:14.261 --> 14:16.430
It'd take a pretty big bouquet
of flowers to do that.

14:16.597 --> 14:19.600
I don't know. Maybe if I explain what
really happened, she'll forgive me.

14:19.766 --> 14:21.435
Sometimes the best apology
is the truth.

14:21.601 --> 14:24.604
You'll tell her you thought she was
prostituting herself for therapy,

14:24.771 --> 14:27.566
but now you've decided that's okay?

14:30.819 --> 14:33.488
Well, not that truth.
Some other truth.

14:40.287 --> 14:42.789
- Good evening, Dad.
- Hey, you two. How was dinner?

14:42.956 --> 14:46.501
It was great. We went to my favourite
restaurant, this little Korean barbecue.

14:46.668 --> 14:49.212
Yes, it's just fabulous.
You get to cook your own food

14:49.379 --> 14:51.923
on this little grill that's
right in the centre of the table.

14:52.090 --> 14:54.801
It splatters a little bit, but,
you know, that's what makes it fun.

14:54.968 --> 14:57.554
Well, clearly,
you had a marvellous time.

14:58.680 --> 15:00.640
- Oh, hello again, Marie.
- Hi, Niles.

15:00.849 --> 15:02.892
If we're gonna go away,
I should make reservations.

15:03.059 --> 15:06.271
Right. I tell you what, use the phone
in my bedroom. I'll be in in a minute.

15:06.479 --> 15:08.148
Actually, just thinking about
getting away

15:08.314 --> 15:10.817
is making me feel more
relaxed already.

15:18.491 --> 15:20.994
- She has a little problem with heights.
- I saw that.

15:21.161 --> 15:23.997
Well, I'm sure glad you guys
patched things up, anyway.

15:24.163 --> 15:26.249
You know,
Duke and I go back a long way.

15:26.416 --> 15:28.793
Got a lot of friends,
but there's something I get from Duke

15:28.960 --> 15:31.379
- that I don't get from anybody else.
- Seahawks tickets.

15:31.588 --> 15:34.590
And don't think that SOB
wasn't ready to pull them, either.

15:37.719 --> 15:40.179
Dad dragged me to one
of those Korean barbecues once.

15:40.638 --> 15:42.348
I've had that suit
dry-cleaned three times.

15:42.515 --> 15:45.727
Eddie still greets me in a carnivorous
frenzy every time I wear it.

15:47.061 --> 15:49.272
Yes, well, the next time Marie
and I go out for dinner,

15:49.439 --> 15:50.648
I'm gonna pick the restaurant,

15:50.815 --> 15:54.152
preferably one where
the stove gets its own room.

15:54.735 --> 15:56.988
Well, she certainly seems
smitten with you.

15:57.155 --> 15:58.781
Yes, she certainly does,
doesn't she?

15:59.282 --> 16:00.825
And I'm quite captivated with her.

16:00.992 --> 16:04.495
You know, I can't put my finger
on exactly why, but...

16:04.704 --> 16:06.581
I'm just glad things
are going well for you.

16:06.747 --> 16:08.249
Are they ever.

16:08.583 --> 16:10.960
I find her more enchanting each day.
Oh, you know what?

16:11.127 --> 16:15.423
I am particularly intrigued
by this recurring dream she has.

16:15.631 --> 16:18.384
She's in the woods,
she's being pursued by a hunter.

16:18.551 --> 16:21.303
And get this, when she turns to
confront the pursuer,

16:21.470 --> 16:23.931
- the hunter has no face.
- Fascinating.

16:24.098 --> 16:25.766
I'm determined to get to
the bottom of it.

16:25.933 --> 16:28.978
I'm sure it would shed light on her
mother issues and this fear of heights.

16:29.145 --> 16:31.480
Oh, God, I've just discovered
that she absolutely refuses

16:31.647 --> 16:33.941
to touch a doorknob
with her bare hand.

16:34.108 --> 16:37.152
Thanks to my natural chivalry,
I missed that for a whole week.

16:38.195 --> 16:40.406
Is that all you talk about,
her problems?

16:40.614 --> 16:44.368
Well, no, no.
We talk about lots of things.

16:44.535 --> 16:47.246
Art, the theatre. Why?

16:47.413 --> 16:51.375
- Oh, it's just a passing thought.
- Well, pass it over here.

16:51.583 --> 16:54.753
Well, you were asking
what most captivated you about her.

16:54.920 --> 16:58.215
Perhaps she's giving you a chance to
exercise your psychiatric muscles.

16:58.424 --> 17:01.093
- What?
- You've been out of work for a while.

17:01.260 --> 17:06.056
Niles, Marie is a stunning woman
with a body to die for,

17:06.223 --> 17:08.142
and you think all I'm interested in
is her mind?

17:08.308 --> 17:10.644
How shallow do you think I am?

17:12.604 --> 17:14.146
Well, there's no need
to get defensive.

17:14.314 --> 17:18.068
There's not a problem,
unless she's falling in love with you

17:18.234 --> 17:20.862
and you're only interested in her
as a case study.

17:21.070 --> 17:25.659
I assure you, I am interested in all
aspects of Marie, not just her psyche.

17:25.867 --> 17:26.910
For God's sakes, you know,

17:27.077 --> 17:29.329
I could happily go for weeks
without discussing it once.

17:29.496 --> 17:31.164
- Glad to hear it.
- Well, thank you.

17:31.331 --> 17:34.459
If you'll excuse me, I have someone
waiting for me in the other room.

17:36.545 --> 17:39.214
Oh, dear God!
Unhand me, you wretch!

17:39.381 --> 17:43.260
Oh, you vile creature!
Oh, for God's sake, you miserable...

17:43.427 --> 17:46.012
Niles, please,
drop him a Liv-A-Snap!

17:46.179 --> 17:49.182
Oh, let go of me!

17:49.391 --> 17:52.519
Let go of that leg, you...

17:54.646 --> 17:56.982
My father's best friend.

17:57.566 --> 17:59.484
Well, after your father.

18:00.026 --> 18:02.362
We're all booked for this weekend.
There's a lake, hiking.

18:02.529 --> 18:04.030
Sounds like a perfect place to relax.

18:04.197 --> 18:06.199
You know, I do love the country.
It's so relaxing.

18:06.366 --> 18:09.494
I swear to God, I'm out like a light
as soon as my head hits the pillow.

18:09.703 --> 18:13.164
Then we'll have to ask for a room
with no pillows.

18:13.665 --> 18:15.959
Oh, that reminds me,
I had that dream again.

18:16.126 --> 18:18.420
But this time,
I saw the hunter's face.

18:19.170 --> 18:20.922
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:21.131 --> 18:23.091
- You'll never guess who it was.
- Who?

18:23.299 --> 18:25.802
- No, no.
- Is something wrong?

18:25.969 --> 18:28.555
No, it's just that I'd rather not
discuss the dream right now.

18:28.763 --> 18:30.265
Oh, you're right. I'm sorry.

18:30.431 --> 18:33.017
Like you even care
who the hunter is right now.

18:33.184 --> 18:37.480
Yes, there are so many other things
I'm more interested in.

18:38.481 --> 18:41.150
- Yeah, that's better, isn't it?
- Yeah.

18:41.526 --> 18:43.569
Do you feel relaxed?

18:44.988 --> 18:47.907
- Was it your sister?
- What?

18:48.074 --> 18:50.201
The hunter.
It was your sister, wasn't it?

18:50.410 --> 18:52.412
No. I thought
you didn't wanna talk about this.

18:52.578 --> 18:55.998
Oh, God, you're right, you're right.
I don't. I really... I really don't.

18:56.165 --> 18:59.377
I'd much rather be exploring
other things right now,

18:59.585 --> 19:04.215
like your lips and your chin

19:04.465 --> 19:08.636
- and your neck.
- Oh, keep going.

19:09.428 --> 19:12.014
Oh, for God's sake, who was it?

19:12.807 --> 19:15.476
- What is with you?
- I just have to know!

19:15.685 --> 19:21.315
- Okay. It was me.
- Of course it was!

19:22.525 --> 19:25.528
The hunter represents your feelings
of anger and abandonment

19:25.695 --> 19:28.239
that you've been running
from ever since your parents' divorce.

19:28.406 --> 19:30.741
Until now, you've been able
to avoid those painful arrows,

19:30.908 --> 19:33.619
sometimes seeking refuge
in the forest of repression.

19:33.828 --> 19:37.873
Now, your willingness to identify the
hunter signals that you are now ready

19:38.040 --> 19:42.127
to reintegrate these complex emotions
into a more cohesive self!

19:42.336 --> 19:46.006
Wow! It's all so clear now.

19:46.215 --> 19:49.510
It certainly is!

19:49.885 --> 19:51.262
That was amazing.

19:51.470 --> 19:53.555
I'm so glad I gave you
a second chance.

19:53.764 --> 19:56.100
- Oh, Marie, l...
- Please don't apologise.

19:56.934 --> 19:59.478
Maybe someday it'll be some
funny story we tell our grandkids,

19:59.645 --> 20:02.606
the time Grandpa broke up
with Grandma.

20:03.982 --> 20:08.445
- Actually, Grandma...
- Yes?

20:08.654 --> 20:12.074
I'm afraid this isn't gonna work.

20:12.866 --> 20:14.451
What?

20:15.452 --> 20:18.080
- Us. I'm afraid that...
- Wait a minute.

20:18.288 --> 20:21.708
Am I crazy
or are you breaking up with me again?

20:21.917 --> 20:24.002
Well, they're not completely
unrelated.

20:26.880 --> 20:32.678
You see,
you are a beautiful young woman

20:32.844 --> 20:35.514
and I have really enjoyed tackling
some of these issues with you.

20:35.681 --> 20:38.266
It's that I don't think
that's the basis for a relationship.

20:38.475 --> 20:40.560
You deserve someone
who appreciates all you offer.

20:40.769 --> 20:41.812
I don't believe this.

20:41.978 --> 20:44.064
I feel more like your therapist
than your boyfriend.

20:44.231 --> 20:46.775
But I thought we were having
such a good time together.

20:48.777 --> 20:51.113
I'm afraid our time is up.

20:56.493 --> 20:59.371
This weekend's game?
Well, yeah, I want them, Duke.

20:59.538 --> 21:03.041
Seahawks-Chiefs, are you kidding?
I'll pick them up tomorrow.

21:03.208 --> 21:06.127
Hey, wouldn't it be a kick
if we wound up in-laws?

21:06.294 --> 21:08.338
- Go to hell!
- Oh, hold on a sec.

21:08.505 --> 21:12.008
Good, embrace the anger.
It's the best way to mental health.

21:12.175 --> 21:15.970
I don't need health tips
from you, you quack!

21:16.179 --> 21:18.139
You made progress
in the time we've been together.

21:18.348 --> 21:21.101
Oh, don't flatter yourself!

21:22.602 --> 21:25.355
- I have the name of a specialist.
- Call him yourself!

21:26.564 --> 21:29.108
Hey, Duke, I'm gonna be kind
of busy tomorrow.

21:29.275 --> 21:31.361
Maybe you could just drop
those tickets in the mail

21:31.528 --> 21:33.488
right now, so you don't forget.
