(NARRATOR READING)

01:01.162 --> 01:03.128
(KION READING)

01:05.399 --> 01:08.400
So, Scar has returned.

01:08.436 --> 01:10.335
I'm afraid so, Father.

01:10.371 --> 01:12.471
It's my fault,
Grandfather Mufasa.

01:12.506 --> 01:13.572
The Roar...

01:13.607 --> 01:17.476
The Roar has the ability
to do both good and evil.

01:17.511 --> 01:21.080
I know.
But now that Scar is back,

01:21.115 --> 01:22.147
how do we defeat him?

01:22.183 --> 01:25.084
The appearance of an evil lion
from the past

01:25.119 --> 01:28.187
is beyond my experience,
my son.

01:28.222 --> 01:33.158
But you have
saved the Pride Lands
from Scar before.

01:33.194 --> 01:36.195
Trust that the wisdom
to defeat Scar

01:36.230 --> 01:38.497
lies within the Pride Lands,

01:38.532 --> 01:41.366
and within the two of you.

01:44.238 --> 01:47.506
"The wisdom is within
the Pride Lands." Dad?

01:47.541 --> 01:50.476
Do you think Grandfather
means a wise animal?

01:50.511 --> 01:55.547
Perhaps, and if he did,
I know exactly
who we should talk to.

01:55.583 --> 01:58.150
Me? You want me to escort

01:58.185 --> 02:01.120
the wisest animal
in the Pride Lands
to meet with the King?

02:01.155 --> 02:04.356
Yes, yes! It is one
of the duties
of the Royal Mjuzi.

02:05.426 --> 02:07.326
You don't need
to send Makini, Simba.

02:07.361 --> 02:08.494
I can talk to you
right now.

02:08.529 --> 02:11.363
I don't think he's looking
for advice from you, Bunga.

02:11.398 --> 02:13.365
Most definitely not.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.300
Okay, your loss.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.436
Simba seeks counsel
from Kongwe,

02:17.471 --> 02:20.272
the wisest of the wise.
BESHTE: Oh, yeah!

02:20.307 --> 02:23.075
Kongwe's the oldest animal
in the Pride Lands.

02:23.110 --> 02:25.077
Ooh! Do you know
where she is?

02:25.112 --> 02:28.213
Last I heard, she was living
along the rocky bank
of Urembo River,

02:28.249 --> 02:29.548
about a half-a-day's walk
from here.

02:29.583 --> 02:33.318
Half a day? I'd like
to speak to her
as soon as possible.

02:33.354 --> 02:36.488
Maybe a half-day for them,
but I can do it faster.

02:36.524 --> 02:38.490
Excellent.
Thank you, Fuli.

02:38.526 --> 02:42.394
Yes! You shall escort
the escort. (LAUGHS)

02:42.429 --> 02:44.363
I can't wait!
Let's go, Fuli!

02:44.398 --> 02:47.132
I'm so excited
to spend time with you.

02:47.168 --> 02:49.434
I'll learn all about you
and you'll learn all about me.

02:49.470 --> 02:51.570
It's gonna be so great!
Don't you think so, Fuli?

02:53.407 --> 02:54.406
Fuli?

02:54.441 --> 02:56.208
You coming, Makini?

02:56.243 --> 02:58.277
Ooh, yeah! Wait for me.

02:59.313 --> 03:02.047
Okay, the rest of us
are on patrol.

03:02.082 --> 03:05.317
Whatever Scar has planned
for the Pride Lands,
we need to be ready.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.486
You got it, Kion!
Affirmative.

03:09.490 --> 03:12.090
MAKINI: My favorite
is definitely
bright pink flamingos.

03:12.126 --> 03:14.092
Oh, but orange
and brown giraffes
are pretty, too.

03:14.128 --> 03:16.161
What animal do you think's
the prettiest, Fuli?

03:16.197 --> 03:18.263
I never really
thought about it.

03:18.299 --> 03:21.099
Oh, blue turacos!
I forgot about them.

03:21.135 --> 03:22.234
I love blue!

03:22.269 --> 03:23.235
(SIGHS IN EXASPERATION)

03:25.172 --> 03:27.172
Okay, here we are.

03:27.208 --> 03:30.275
Urembo River.
Really? We got here fast.

03:30.311 --> 03:31.577
Fast is what I do.

03:31.612 --> 03:35.581
So, let's find Kongwe
and get her back
to the King, quick.

03:35.616 --> 03:37.216
What does she look like?

03:37.251 --> 03:38.450
Ooh, I don't know.

03:38.485 --> 03:41.220
Okay, what kind of animal
is she?

03:41.255 --> 03:42.387
Don't know that, either.

03:42.423 --> 03:44.256
Don't you think
that's something

03:44.291 --> 03:47.159
we might have asked Rafiki
before we left?

03:47.194 --> 03:49.361
Yes, you are so right, Fuli!

03:49.396 --> 03:52.531
That's definitely something
we should have asked Rafiki
before we left.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.433
But at least we know
where to find her.

03:54.468 --> 03:56.168
She should be right here.

03:56.203 --> 04:00.138
Huh, finding her would go
a lot faster if we knew
what she looked like.

04:00.174 --> 04:01.240
Whoa!

04:04.078 --> 04:06.211
Faster is not always better.

04:06.247 --> 04:07.512
Oh, are you Kongwe?

04:07.548 --> 04:09.181
Yes.

04:09.216 --> 04:12.417
Of course, you are.
What you just said
sounded really wise.

04:12.453 --> 04:15.220
But you already know that,
being so wise and all.

04:15.256 --> 04:16.521
And that's why the King
needs to see you.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.090
The King?

04:18.125 --> 04:20.125
Yes, he wants to see you
right away.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.460
I see.

04:21.495 --> 04:24.429
But, of course,
you're a tortoise.

04:24.465 --> 04:28.300
Indeed, for my mother
was a tortoise.

04:28.335 --> 04:33.138
A child of a tortoise
is also a tortoise.

04:33.173 --> 04:37.242
Oh, you are wise.
Isn't she wise, Fuli?

04:37.278 --> 04:38.477
Uh, I guess?

04:38.512 --> 04:41.380
Now, let's go.
We don't want to keep
the King waiting.

04:41.415 --> 04:43.515
Oh, Fuli's right.
We should hurry.

04:44.218 --> 04:47.552
To run is not necessarily
to arrive.

04:47.588 --> 04:50.555
That sounds super-wise!

04:51.358 --> 04:53.158
What exactly does it mean?

04:53.193 --> 04:56.361
It means this is gonna be
a long trip.

04:58.365 --> 05:02.200
So, Kion, does King Simba
have a plan to defeat Scar?

05:02.236 --> 05:03.302
KION: Not yet.

05:03.337 --> 05:06.138
Hopefully, this Kongwe
will have some good ideas.

05:06.340 --> 05:08.140
Seeing anything
interesting, Ono?

05:08.175 --> 05:09.374
Not really.

05:09.410 --> 05:11.510
Unless you count hyraxes
crossing the bridge

05:11.545 --> 05:13.278
to the watering hole
as interesting.

05:13.314 --> 05:14.446
Wait a tick.

05:18.085 --> 05:20.319

Affirmative.

05:56.523 --> 05:59.224
Though we now have
a bunch of thirsty hyraxes

05:59.259 --> 06:00.392
that can't get
to the watering hole.

06:00.427 --> 06:02.294
Sorry, little guys.

06:02.329 --> 06:05.097
Aw, they look so thirsty.

06:05.132 --> 06:08.266
Hey! I can go up there
and throw 'em
across the ravine.

06:08.302 --> 06:10.469
I'm not so sure
that's a good idea, Bunga.

06:10.504 --> 06:12.070
Hmm...

06:12.106 --> 06:13.505
What you thinking, Beshte?

06:13.540 --> 06:16.408
Well, if we could move
one of those big rocks...

06:16.443 --> 06:18.143
KION: It could make
another bridge.

06:18.178 --> 06:20.245
But how would we hold it up?

06:34.228 --> 06:36.428
Back it up
a little more, Beshte.

Sure was!

06:49.576 --> 06:52.544
You make an un-Bunga-lievable
bridge, Beshte.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.112

06:58.552 --> 06:59.818
I like it.

But I always like
helping the animals
of the Pride Lands.

07:03.457 --> 07:05.290
Okay, if we keep up this pace,

07:05.325 --> 07:08.226
I think we can be back at
Pride Rock just after sundown.

07:11.165 --> 07:13.365

07:18.105 --> 07:21.273
Kongwe found
an amazing flower. Look.

07:21.308 --> 07:23.241
Another flower?
Yeah!

07:23.277 --> 07:25.343
It's totally different
from the last one.

07:25.379 --> 07:26.378
It's a flower.

07:26.413 --> 07:29.481
(SNIFFS) Each bloom
is unique, Fuli.

07:29.516 --> 07:32.384
You'd see that if you
just stop and observe.

07:32.419 --> 07:34.453
That is so true, Kongwe!

07:34.488 --> 07:37.222
And so wisdom-y!

07:37.257 --> 07:39.424
Okay, but right now we have

07:39.460 --> 07:43.094
slightly more important things
to see than flowers,

07:43.130 --> 07:44.229
like the King!

Oh, that's so true,
too, Fuli.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.201
Aren't you excited
to see the King, Kongwe?

07:49.236 --> 07:52.170
I have seen many things,
young Mjuzi,

07:52.206 --> 07:55.307
because I stop and observe.

07:55.342 --> 07:58.143
That's probably the best way
to see a lot of things.

07:58.178 --> 08:00.212
I see a lot more
when I'm going fast.

08:00.247 --> 08:03.215
Oh, that must be a good way
to see things, too.

11:34.294 --> 11:36.394
What are you waiting for?
We need to see the King.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.565
MAKINI: At least we're going
faster now, right, Fuli?

11:40.600 --> 11:43.568
I think it was faster
when we were pushing her.

11:44.337 --> 11:45.336
Hmm.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.139
Would you look at this?

11:48.175 --> 11:49.574
Do we have to?

11:49.609 --> 11:53.344
One doesn't usually see
roots like this close-up.
I sure haven't.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.313
I wonder why these roots
aren't in the ground.

11:57.451 --> 12:00.085
And I wonder
why they're moving.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.453
FULI: Because that tree's
about to fall!

12:01.488 --> 12:02.487
Move!

12:02.522 --> 12:04.189
(FULI GRUNTS)
(MAKINI SCREAMS)

12:06.159 --> 12:08.293
That was some fast save, Fuli.

12:08.328 --> 12:11.362
Hey, maybe fast is best.

12:11.398 --> 12:14.332
That's what I keep saying.
KONGWE: Perhaps.

12:15.135 --> 12:16.468
Kongwe?

12:16.503 --> 12:20.505
But sometimes,
standing still is
the fastest route to safety.

12:20.540 --> 12:21.539
You got lucky.

12:21.575 --> 12:24.209
Not luck, observation.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.478
But also, I did get lucky.

12:29.316 --> 12:33.184
When a big tree falls,
many eat its leaves.

12:33.220 --> 12:34.552
Or many get crushed.

12:34.588 --> 12:38.189
If I hadn't gotten you
to stop and look at the tree,

12:38.225 --> 12:40.291
perhaps we all would have
been crushed.

12:40.327 --> 12:41.359
Maybe.

12:42.195 --> 12:44.095
This tree is
not going anywhere,

12:44.131 --> 12:47.098
and neither are we,
at least not on this path.

12:47.134 --> 12:48.333
We could go over!

12:49.236 --> 12:51.269
Oh, but Kongwe can't.

12:55.242 --> 12:57.208
So, here's what
we're gonna do.

12:57.244 --> 13:00.111
There's a path back there
that cuts through
the Backlands.

13:00.147 --> 13:02.180
That's the fastest way
to get to Pride Rock
from here.

13:02.215 --> 13:03.381
Come on.

13:04.151 --> 13:06.317
The Backlands
are leopard territory,

13:06.353 --> 13:07.485
so stay close to me.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.088
Unless one is a bird,

13:10.123 --> 13:13.391
one rarely gets to see
the top of a tree this close.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.093
Seriously?

13:17.097 --> 13:19.430
We're going the right way,
but keep an eye out.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.267
I always keep an eye out.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.536
Well, there is a lot to see
here in the Backlands.

13:24.571 --> 13:26.371
I should come here
more often.

13:26.406 --> 13:28.206
You're always welcome.

13:29.176 --> 13:31.075
Especially you, tortoise.

13:31.111 --> 13:33.111
That's very friendly
of you! I'm...

13:33.146 --> 13:34.212
(ROARS)
(WHIMPERS)

13:35.282 --> 13:37.482
You're a real delicacy
around here, tortoise.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.551
Back off, Makucha.
They're with me.

13:39.619 --> 13:42.420
(CHUCKLES) Oh.
Didn't see you there, cheetah.

13:42.455 --> 13:44.088
Well, now you have.

13:44.124 --> 13:47.525
And now I wanna see
you walking away.

13:47.561 --> 13:50.428
So, where are
your Lion Guard pals?

13:50.463 --> 13:54.098
Don't you worry about them.
You deal with me.

13:54.134 --> 13:58.203
Okay, cheetah,
I'll be on my way...
For now.

13:58.238 --> 14:01.239
But remember,
you're in my territory.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.276
Not for long.
Let's keep moving.

14:05.312 --> 14:07.512
Wow, Fuli, that was amazing!

14:07.547 --> 14:10.448
You were amazing! I've never
seen anything like that.

14:10.483 --> 14:12.450
Have you ever seen
anything like that, Kongwe?

14:12.485 --> 14:15.053
I've seen many things.

14:16.089 --> 14:18.289
He's gone for now,
but I bet he comes back.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.391
So we really need
to pick up the pace.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.530
This way!

14:27.100 --> 14:29.133
Where are they?
I don't see 'em.

14:29.169 --> 14:30.368
They were right here, Kion.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.170
They must be lost
in the smoke.

14:32.205 --> 14:35.173
ELAND: Help! (COUGHS) Help!

14:35.208 --> 14:37.308
Beshte, Bunga,
you're with me.

14:37.344 --> 14:39.510
Ono, see if you can
guide us from the sky.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.079
Affirmative.

14:43.450 --> 14:44.716
Guys!

14:44.751 --> 14:47.118
The fires are limited to
the trees at the top
of the canyon!

14:47.153 --> 14:49.220
It's not spreading
any further.

14:49.256 --> 14:50.221
Guys?

14:50.523 --> 14:54.192
Guys?
KION: This way, elands!
This way!

14:54.227 --> 14:56.194
(ELANDS COUGHING)

14:58.398 --> 15:01.099
Thank you, Kion.
We're not
out of the woods, yet.

15:01.134 --> 15:03.434
Uh, actually, Kion,
we are.

15:03.470 --> 15:05.403
He means the fire's
still a threat.

15:05.438 --> 15:08.406
KION: Right. We need
to get everyone
into the canyon.

15:08.441 --> 15:12.043
ONO: Of course.
The canyon's a natural break
against the fire.

15:12.078 --> 15:14.245
Come on, elands.
You can follow me.

15:17.384 --> 15:18.383
(ALL GASP)

15:19.185 --> 15:20.151
Look out!

15:21.354 --> 15:24.289
Kion!
We're okay, but we're cut off.

15:24.324 --> 15:27.458
Ono, any other way down?
Or across?

15:30.263 --> 15:33.164
I don't think so.
The canyon narrows up ahead.

15:33.199 --> 15:35.199
But it's too far
for the elands to jump.

15:35.235 --> 15:38.436
Maybe they can't jump it,
but if we could cross it...

15:38.471 --> 15:41.439
Beshte! We could sure use
a bridge right about now.

15:41.474 --> 15:45.209
Just what I was thinking.
One Big B bridge coming up.

15:48.581 --> 15:51.549
Big B bridge!
Told you it'd catch on.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.260
Let's go!
Is it safe?

16:02.295 --> 16:04.262
Um, it's safer than flames.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.263
Good point.

16:06.066 --> 16:08.099
(BESHTE GRUNTING)
KION: Keep moving.

16:08.134 --> 16:09.467
You doing okay, Beshte?

16:09.502 --> 16:13.071
'Course he's okay.
He did it before
with the hyraxes.

16:13.106 --> 16:14.339
Right, Big B?

16:14.374 --> 16:18.343
Well, a herd of eland
is a little heavier
than hyraxes.

16:18.378 --> 16:20.078
But I don't mind.

16:20.413 --> 16:22.280
That's all of them, Kion.

16:25.218 --> 16:26.217
(GRUNTS)

16:26.252 --> 16:28.086
Nice work, Beshte.

16:31.358 --> 16:33.324
MAKINI: Rafiki will be
so impressed

16:33.360 --> 16:37.128
if I can remember
every super-wise thing
you've ever said, Kongwe.

16:37.163 --> 16:38.396
But it's not easy.

16:39.099 --> 16:41.466
"A patient creature
never misses a thing."

16:41.501 --> 16:43.067
I think that's right.

16:43.103 --> 16:45.069
Sure sounds smart,
don't you think, Fuli?

16:45.105 --> 16:46.471
(ROARS)

16:46.506 --> 16:47.505
I think so.

16:47.540 --> 16:50.241
I've been patiently waiting.

16:50.276 --> 16:52.443
And now,
I won't miss my supper.

to back off.

some other moves.

You chased him off!
Big deal, he'll be back.

18:33.546 --> 18:36.347
Unless I can figure out
a way to beat him.

18:36.382 --> 18:41.119
To beat the leopard,
you must observe the leopard.

18:41.154 --> 18:43.154
I have observed him!

18:43.189 --> 18:46.457
I observe him zigzagging
away from me every time.

18:46.493 --> 18:50.428
I observe him making me
run a lot more than he does.

18:50.463 --> 18:54.365
Cheetah, cheetah,
always running.

18:54.400 --> 18:58.336
You must relax and observe.

Relax?
Of course!

Fine. (BREATHES DEEPLY)

Now, Fuli,
what have you observed?

He always zigzags,
but I can't.

19:21.060 --> 19:25.496
I see. So, he always zigzags.

19:25.532 --> 19:27.165
Yes, he...

But who's counting?

All it took was
a little observing.

20:32.298 --> 20:35.233
The cheetah listened
to the tortoise.

I've truly seen everything.

going as fast as she can.

Kongwe turned out to be
a tortoise.

Have you ever

They just follow the wind.

21:21.147 --> 21:24.315
Hmm. So Scar has returned.

21:24.350 --> 21:26.450
It is indeed
a difficult problem.

Uh, yeah!

21:28.421 --> 21:29.487
Bunga!

21:30.356 --> 21:33.124
So, Kongwe,
what do we do?

21:33.159 --> 21:38.095
Fortunately, it is
the patient animal
who eats the ripe fruit.

21:38.564 --> 21:40.398
Yes.
Uh-huh.

21:40.433 --> 21:41.565

21:41.601 --> 21:45.236
I think she means we'll
find the solution eventually.

21:45.271 --> 21:47.371
But we need to take
the time to look.

21:47.407 --> 21:48.539
I see.
Oh!

21:48.574 --> 21:50.341
Very wise.

21:50.376 --> 21:54.178
Yes, yes, cheetah!
I have seen many things.

21:54.213 --> 21:58.382
And good always triumphs
over evil, in time.
