02:33.953 --> 02:36.080
Hi. Welcome to the future.

02:36.389 --> 02:39.586
San Dimas, California, 2688.

02:39.893 --> 02:42.418
And I'm telling you, it's great here.

02:42.495 --> 02:45.191
The air is clean. The water's clean.

02:45.431 --> 02:47.558
Even the dirt is clean.

02:48.134 --> 02:52.161
Bowling averages are way up.
Mini-golf scores are way down.

02:52.272 --> 02:54.570
And we have more excellent waterslides...

02:54.641 --> 02:57.132
...than any other planet
we communicate with.

02:57.443 --> 02:59.968
I'm telling you, this place is great...

03:00.380 --> 03:02.109
...but it almost wasn't.

03:02.315 --> 03:05.842
You see, 700 years ago,
the two great ones...

03:06.386 --> 03:08.081
...ran into a few problems.

03:08.154 --> 03:10.816
So now I have to travel back in time
to help them out.

03:12.158 --> 03:14.752
<i>If I fail to keep these two</i>
<i>on the correct path...</i>

03:14.994 --> 03:17.087
<i>... the basis of our society will be in danger.</i>

03:17.497 --> 03:20.193
<i>Don't worry, it'll all make sense.</i>
<i>I'm a professional.</i>

03:21.267 --> 03:24.065
I'm Bill S. Preston, Esquire!

03:24.137 --> 03:28.665
And I'm Ted... Hold on.
Bill, here, you take it.

03:28.875 --> 03:30.069
Okay.

03:34.147 --> 03:37.275
- And I'm Ted <i>"</i> Theodore <i>"</i> Logan.
- Yeah!

03:42.355 --> 03:45.552
And we're Wyld Stallyns!

03:55.602 --> 03:58.400
- Smell it, dude.
- Let's bail.

04:08.581 --> 04:09.946
We blew it.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.877
Guess we used too much power.

04:13.453 --> 04:14.818
I liked it.

04:17.991 --> 04:22.087
While I agree that, in time,
our band will be most triumphant...

04:22.161 --> 04:25.130
...the truth is,
Wyld Stallyns will never be a super band...

04:25.198 --> 04:27.223
...until we have Eddie Van Halen on guitar.

04:27.867 --> 04:31.803
Yes, but I do not believe
we will get Eddie Van Halen...

04:31.871 --> 04:33.498
...until we have a triumphant video.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.508
It's pointless to have a triumphant video...

04:36.576 --> 04:39.067
...before we even have decent instruments.

04:39.212 --> 04:42.511
How could we have decent instruments
if we don't know how to play?

04:43.182 --> 04:45.207
That is why we need Eddie Van Halen!

04:45.718 --> 04:48.209
And that is why we need
a triumphant video.

04:50.323 --> 04:51.551
Excellent!

04:56.629 --> 04:58.358
- We're late!
- For what?

04:58.698 --> 05:00.962
- For school, dude!
- Yeah.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.338
Bill, I'm waiting.

05:14.647 --> 05:15.636
He's dead?

05:17.884 --> 05:21.786
What you're telling me, essentially,
is that Napoleon...

05:22.422 --> 05:25.255
...was a short dead dude.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.049
Yeah.

05:28.961 --> 05:30.724
You totally blew it, dude.

05:31.130 --> 05:33.155
- Ted, stand up.
- Stand up?

05:33.232 --> 05:34.597
Yes, son. Stand up.

05:37.503 --> 05:38.663
Now...

05:39.739 --> 05:40.899
Who was Joan of Arc?

05:43.676 --> 05:44.665
Noah's wife.

05:48.981 --> 05:51.848
Listen, guys, don't forget:
Tomorrow, final report...

05:51.984 --> 05:53.781
...1:30 to 3:30, okay?

05:59.692 --> 06:00.954
Guys.

06:04.130 --> 06:05.495
Mr. Ryan...

06:06.132 --> 06:10.626
Before you say anything,
my distinguished colleague, Ted, and I...

06:10.803 --> 06:13.294
...wish to express to you our thanks...

06:13.606 --> 06:16.439
...for all the things
we have learned in your class.

06:16.509 --> 06:17.874
And what have you learned?

06:23.015 --> 06:25.848
We've learned
that the world has a great history.

06:26.285 --> 06:30.881
Yes. And that thanks
to great leaders such as...

06:31.924 --> 06:33.915
...Genghis Khan, Joan of Arc...

06:34.026 --> 06:36.017
...and Socratic Method...

06:36.095 --> 06:39.792
...the world is full of history.

06:43.102 --> 06:47.732
It seems to me the only thing
you've learned is that Caesar...

06:49.041 --> 06:50.872
...is a <i>"</i> salad-dressing dude.<i>"</i>

06:52.278 --> 06:54.542
Bill, Ted, this is really quite simple.

06:54.614 --> 06:57.048
You have flunked
every section of this class.

06:58.251 --> 07:02.210
Now, unless you get an A plus
on your final oral report tomorrow...

07:03.055 --> 07:06.149
...guys, I have no choice
but to flunk the both of you.

07:07.293 --> 07:08.453
You know your topics.

07:09.295 --> 07:12.662
So I would suggest
you at least cover those areas...

07:13.266 --> 07:15.131
...if you want to pass the course.

07:15.635 --> 07:17.796
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

07:18.538 --> 07:19.732
Okay.

07:23.643 --> 07:28.171
Your report
had better be something very special.

07:31.384 --> 07:32.476
Man.

07:34.954 --> 07:38.014
What are we supposed to know
for our report?

07:38.090 --> 07:39.250
I'm not sure.

07:39.325 --> 07:42.761
One thing I know is that
Joan of Arc is not Noah's wife.

07:42.829 --> 07:47.459
- Then who is Noah's wife?
- I don't know, Ted.

07:47.900 --> 07:51.836
But I do know we're in serious trouble.
Listen to this:

07:52.805 --> 07:55.899
<i>"</i> Express to the class
how an important historical figure...

07:55.975 --> 07:57.704
<i>"</i>... from each of your time periods...

07:57.777 --> 08:01.235
<i>"</i>... would view the world
of San Dimas, 1988.<i>"</i>

08:03.115 --> 08:06.778
We're in danger of flunking
most heinously tomorrow.

08:07.920 --> 08:10.684
- Hi, Bill. Want a ride?
- Sure, Missy.

08:12.091 --> 08:13.080
I mean, Mom.

08:16.095 --> 08:18.563
- Your stepmom is cute.
- Shut up.

08:18.631 --> 08:21.964
Remember when she was a senior
and we were freshmen?

08:28.841 --> 08:31.537
I'll be right back as soon as I get my books.

08:44.790 --> 08:48.248
- What are you doing home, Dad?
- I'm looking for my keys.

08:48.928 --> 08:50.793
You haven't done anything with them?

08:52.164 --> 08:53.392
No, sir.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.831
I spoke to your principal today.

08:56.335 --> 08:58.997
- He said you're failing history.
- Me and Bill...

08:59.071 --> 09:02.507
He also said that if you fail history,
you flunk out of school.

09:03.943 --> 09:06.673
You know what that would mean,
don't you?

09:07.113 --> 09:11.072
That I would have to go
to Oates Military Academy, sir.

09:11.851 --> 09:14.445
I spoke to Col. Oates this morning.

09:16.522 --> 09:19.116
He's anxious to meet you.

09:34.473 --> 09:38.432
Dude, we gotta pass,
otherwise there's no more band.

09:39.245 --> 09:42.681
- Why?
- My dad's sending me to military school.

09:43.416 --> 09:44.576
Where?

09:46.085 --> 09:47.245
Alaska.

09:49.188 --> 09:50.348
Alaska.

09:57.363 --> 10:01.356
It is time. Their separation is imminent.

10:31.297 --> 10:32.992
Be excellent to each other.

10:34.734 --> 10:36.395
Party on, dude.

11:05.231 --> 11:07.165
<i>Okay, Ted, George Washington.</i>

11:07.400 --> 11:12.235
- One: The father of our country.
- Two: Born on Presidents' Day.

11:12.772 --> 11:15.332
Three: The dollar-bill guy.

11:15.875 --> 11:18.503
You ever made
a mushroom out of his head?

11:18.944 --> 11:20.002
Alaska.

11:22.081 --> 11:23.173
Okay.

11:26.819 --> 11:29.117
Had wooden teeth, chased Moby Dick.

11:30.256 --> 11:32.247
That's Capt. Ahab, dude.

11:33.826 --> 11:36.158
Wait. Remember Disney World?

11:36.328 --> 11:39.855
- Hall of Presidents?
- Yeah, good. What did he say?

11:41.100 --> 11:43.398
<i>"</i> Welcome to the Hall of Presidents.<i>"</i>

11:45.071 --> 11:47.562
Hi. I brought you guys some food.

11:59.618 --> 12:01.483
It's your mom, dude.

12:02.555 --> 12:03.681
How's it going?

12:05.157 --> 12:06.215
Bad.

12:07.193 --> 12:10.560
We're destined to flunk
most egregiously tomorrow.

12:11.063 --> 12:15.295
And I am destined to end up
at Oates Military Academy.

12:15.901 --> 12:18.165
And then we will never start our band.

12:20.039 --> 12:22.473
Good.

12:28.614 --> 12:31.742
- What are you guys studying, anyway?
- History.

12:31.951 --> 12:33.111
Mr. Ryan?

12:33.919 --> 12:35.318
Tell him hi.

12:35.488 --> 12:38.651
Why don't you guys take a dinner break?

12:39.892 --> 12:41.291
Thanks, Dad.

12:55.474 --> 12:58.705
Now your dad is going for it
in your own room.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.006
Shut up.

13:00.880 --> 13:03.906
- Your stepmom is cute, though.
- Shut up.

13:03.983 --> 13:07.282
- Remember when I asked her to the prom?
- Shut up!

13:10.823 --> 13:13.383
1275.

13:15.928 --> 13:18.362
Okay, the lady in that car over there...

13:18.430 --> 13:21.866
...said that Marco Polo was
in the year 1275.

13:22.434 --> 13:25.232
It's not just a water sport. I knew it.

13:26.038 --> 13:29.599
Excuse me.
When did the Mongols rule China?

13:30.242 --> 13:32.506
I don't know. I just work here.

13:37.783 --> 13:40.684
- You want to try the Thrifty Mart?
- Sure.

14:02.975 --> 14:04.636
Not bad.

14:09.148 --> 14:11.810
Greetings, my excellent friends.

14:13.152 --> 14:15.643
Do you know
when the Mongols ruled China?

14:18.691 --> 14:19.988
Perhaps we can ask them.

14:23.462 --> 14:25.760
Bill S. Preston, Esquire.

14:27.566 --> 14:29.557
And Ted <i>"</i> Theodore <i>"</i> Logan.

14:30.536 --> 14:31.833
Gentlemen...

14:32.204 --> 14:34.536
I'm here to help you
with your history report.

14:35.274 --> 14:38.175
- What?
- How?

14:41.313 --> 14:42.871
I hate that part.

14:44.316 --> 14:46.341
- Bill.
- What?

14:46.418 --> 14:49.945
Strange things are afoot at the Circle K.

14:55.995 --> 14:58.987
Dudes, you guys are going to
go back in time!

14:59.732 --> 15:03.862
You are going to have the most excellent
adventure through history.

15:04.536 --> 15:07.437
- Who are you guys?
- We're you, dude!

15:07.973 --> 15:09.235
No way.

15:09.975 --> 15:13.206
- No way.
- Yes way!

15:13.279 --> 15:14.473
We know how you feel.

15:15.014 --> 15:17.175
We didn't believe it either
when we were you...

15:17.249 --> 15:20.082
...and we-us said
what we-us are saying right now.

15:20.152 --> 15:21.619
Okay, wait.

15:22.021 --> 15:24.512
If you guys are really us...

15:26.392 --> 15:28.326
...what number are we thinking of?

15:29.361 --> 15:31.556
Sixty-nine, dudes!

15:38.404 --> 15:42.966
- Look, dudes, we gotta go.
- Yeah, we gotta get back to the report.

15:43.108 --> 15:44.268
Rufus!

15:45.577 --> 15:48.944
Listen to this dude Rufus.
He knows what he's talking about.

15:49.014 --> 15:52.745
Right. And, Ted,
give my love to the princesses.

15:53.252 --> 15:55.948
- Who?
- You'll see.

15:57.456 --> 15:59.686
Gentlemen, is everything all right?

15:59.758 --> 16:02.727
Yeah, except how come
the number we dialed...

16:03.963 --> 16:06.261
Don't forget to wind your watch!

16:08.834 --> 16:11.064
Thanks, Rufus.

16:12.071 --> 16:14.266
Catch you later, Bill and Ted!

16:26.185 --> 16:28.847
Dude, are you sure
we should be doing this?

16:29.588 --> 16:32.819
Ted, you and I have witnessed
many things...

16:33.559 --> 16:36.722
...but nothing as bodacious
as what just happened.

16:37.329 --> 16:39.627
Besides, we told ourselves
to listen to this guy.

16:41.266 --> 16:42.597
What if we were lying?

16:45.304 --> 16:47.169
Why would we lie to ourselves?

16:52.978 --> 16:54.843
How are you going to help us?

16:54.913 --> 16:57.507
Yeah, are you going to call someone
and get the answers?

16:57.583 --> 17:00.780
Gentlemen, we're going to do
a lot more than that.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.349
Excellent.

17:07.992 --> 17:09.961
<i>Brace yourselves, amigos.</i>

17:19.003 --> 17:20.403
Gentlemen...

17:22.207 --> 17:23.367
We're history.

17:31.784 --> 17:35.242
Rufus, where are we, dude?

17:35.888 --> 17:38.049
These are the circuits of history,
gentlemen.

17:38.123 --> 17:40.990
They'll take us
to any point in time we wish.

17:41.093 --> 17:42.151
How?

17:43.028 --> 17:45.223
Modern technology, William.

18:03.248 --> 18:07.309
- That was most unprecedented, Rufus.
- Yeah.

18:09.154 --> 18:11.054
But where are we, Rufus?

18:12.491 --> 18:14.721
Austria, 1805.

18:15.661 --> 18:17.253
The French have just invaded.

18:20.332 --> 18:22.300
Bill, check it out!

18:23.168 --> 18:25.659
We're in the middle of a war, dude!

18:38.050 --> 18:40.814
<i>Amigos, time to depart.</i>

18:43.789 --> 18:45.347
How's it going, dude?

19:20.292 --> 19:21.623
Now where are we, dude?

19:23.595 --> 19:24.857
It's my house.

19:24.930 --> 19:29.458
Rufus, can we go
anywhere we want at any time?

19:29.601 --> 19:31.364
You can do anything you want...

19:31.436 --> 19:34.064
...as long as you remember this:
No matter what happens...

19:34.139 --> 19:36.937
...you must get to that report. Got it?

19:37.309 --> 19:38.970
<i>All right, amigos...</i>

19:39.111 --> 19:42.171
...that book will give you the number
of anyplace you want to go.

19:43.182 --> 19:46.618
Now, most important,
no matter what you do...

19:46.685 --> 19:51.349
...no matter where you go,
that clock, the clock in San Dimas...

19:51.790 --> 19:53.382
...is always running.

19:53.458 --> 19:54.823
- Got it?
- Yeah.

19:55.093 --> 19:57.323
All right, time for me to go.

19:57.796 --> 20:00.822
- What do you mean, Rufus?
- Yeah, aren't you coming with us?

20:01.200 --> 20:03.794
Gentlemen, you're on your own.

20:18.183 --> 20:20.344
- Ted?
- What?

20:21.153 --> 20:23.781
This has been a most unusual day.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.227
- It's Napoleon.
- Who?

20:36.668 --> 20:39.967
The short dead dude
from our history review.

20:41.173 --> 20:43.368
I have a most excellent idea.

20:43.642 --> 20:46.406
Grab his legs. We gotta get him inside.

20:47.613 --> 20:50.241
I think I figured out
a way to pass our report.

20:50.315 --> 20:51.441
How?

20:51.516 --> 20:55.850
We got one historical figure here,
maybe we can go back and get more.

20:56.421 --> 20:57.547
Yeah.

20:58.056 --> 21:01.025
Deacon, you have to watch this guy.

21:01.093 --> 21:05.553
His name is Napoleon.
He is a very famous French dude.

21:05.631 --> 21:08.532
We've decided to collect
other important figures from history...

21:08.600 --> 21:10.397
...for an oral report we are doing.

21:10.469 --> 21:14.166
While we are gone,
you are not to let him out of your sight.

21:14.239 --> 21:18.005
Here is some money.
Take him to the movies or something.

21:25.217 --> 21:26.809
Napoleon?

21:27.519 --> 21:29.680
I am Bill.

21:30.756 --> 21:34.453
We'll take you back to France after
you tell us what you think of San Dimas.

21:35.027 --> 21:38.224
- This is Ted's little brother, Deacon.
- Hi.

21:38.297 --> 21:39.821
He'll take care of you.

21:43.502 --> 21:46.266
- Ready, Ted?
- Ready, Bill.

21:46.571 --> 21:48.766
Let's go back into history.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.545
This should be most triumphant.

21:56.581 --> 21:58.776
I want to speak with you, son.

21:59.651 --> 22:01.346
Alone, please, Bill.

22:04.523 --> 22:06.286
All right, sit down.

22:08.994 --> 22:11.121
What am I going to do with you?

22:11.196 --> 22:12.356
Great.

22:12.964 --> 22:15.660
You lose my keys, you fail history.

22:15.901 --> 22:17.994
You spend all your time
with your loser friend...

22:18.070 --> 22:20.095
...planning a band that will never happen.

22:20.172 --> 22:23.630
You're not to leave this house
until tomorrow morning.

22:27.412 --> 22:28.401
Yes?

22:28.480 --> 22:32.883
<i>Capt. Logan, this is Dep. Van Halen</i>
<i>down at the station.</i>

22:33.185 --> 22:34.982
Dep. Van Halen?

22:38.824 --> 22:40.758
I'm new, dude... sir.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.991
Look, we found your keys...

22:44.062 --> 22:47.395
<i>... and if you want them,</i>
<i>you better come and get them.</i>

22:51.069 --> 22:55.631
When I get back from the station,
I want you packed and ready to go. Got it?

23:02.614 --> 23:04.673
We are in serious trouble.

23:04.916 --> 23:08.044
My dad already signed me up.
My plane leaves tomorrow night.

23:09.054 --> 23:11.113
That's only if we fail, dude.

23:15.694 --> 23:17.286
No way!

23:18.663 --> 23:22.929
Okay, we got Sigmund Frood,
Beeth Oven...

23:23.001 --> 23:27.199
Is there one for the Western Movement
in America in the 19th century?

23:28.106 --> 23:29.198
Yeah.

23:29.741 --> 23:31.208
Well, then...

23:32.677 --> 23:35.077
Let's reach out and touch someone.

24:24.362 --> 24:26.557
How's it going, Old West dude?

24:28.166 --> 24:31.465
This is just like Frontierland.

24:31.536 --> 24:34.004
Yeah, but you can get shot here.

24:35.340 --> 24:38.138
- So just try to act natural.
- Okay.

24:41.680 --> 24:43.580
- Howdy, partner.
- Howdy.

24:43.648 --> 24:47.106
- Watch out for the horse crap.
- Thanks, dude.

24:47.752 --> 24:49.947
- I'm totally thirsty.
- Me, too.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.165
Two beers, please.

25:13.178 --> 25:17.808
- He didn't even card us, dude.
- Yeah, we'll have to remember this place.

25:24.756 --> 25:26.656
Who should we take with us?

25:37.469 --> 25:40.199
- Who's he?
- He's Billy the Kid.

25:41.573 --> 25:45.009
He's famous, dude. Let's bag him.

25:47.979 --> 25:49.606
I need two men.

25:51.616 --> 25:52.844
Who's with me?

25:53.485 --> 25:55.578
We're with you, Billy the Kid.

26:04.796 --> 26:08.755
Here's the deal. What I win, I keep.

26:09.467 --> 26:12.459
What you win, I keep.

26:13.638 --> 26:15.401
Sounds good, Mr. The Kid.

26:30.488 --> 26:34.549
Dude, you've got to have
a poker face like me.

26:39.664 --> 26:41.427
Three aces!

26:43.234 --> 26:45.327
What the hell's going on here, Billy?

26:46.972 --> 26:48.997
Are you a-cheatin' us, Kid?

26:50.675 --> 26:53.803
Cheating? Me?

27:12.664 --> 27:14.029
Excellent!

27:21.673 --> 27:26.542
Look, we're totally weak.
We can't possibly fight you.

27:27.012 --> 27:30.504
However, how would you gentlemen like...

27:31.016 --> 27:35.612
...free passes to Waterloo,
home of excellent waterslides?

27:36.621 --> 27:38.145
Nice try, dude.

27:52.570 --> 27:53.798
Come on.

27:56.241 --> 27:59.005
- Look.
- It's the Goodyear blimp.

28:06.051 --> 28:08.485
I can't believe they fell for that.

28:13.158 --> 28:14.921
- Let's get 'em!
- Let's kill them!

28:16.995 --> 28:18.223
Come on!

28:19.464 --> 28:22.763
- You guys saved my life.
- Nothing doing, Billy the Kid.

28:22.834 --> 28:25.359
- Where are we going?
- The golden age of civilization.

28:25.437 --> 28:27.735
- Where?
- Ancient Greece, dude.

28:27.806 --> 28:31.003
Don't worry, we'll bring you back
as soon as you talk at our report.

28:32.811 --> 28:33.800
What?

29:08.480 --> 29:09.879
Socrates?

29:10.849 --> 29:14.979
- We know that name.
- Yeah. Look him up.

29:16.054 --> 29:17.919
It's under <i>"</i> So-crates.<i>"</i>

29:18.323 --> 29:19.585
Yeah.

29:23.261 --> 29:24.626
<i>"</i> So-crates:

29:25.430 --> 29:26.863
<i>"'</i> The only true wisdom...

29:26.931 --> 29:29.991
<i>"'</i>... consists in knowing
that you know nothing.<i>"'</i>

29:32.504 --> 29:34.096
That's us, dude!

29:34.472 --> 29:35.734
Yeah!

29:36.274 --> 29:38.299
- Let's bag him.
- Yeah.

29:54.359 --> 29:55.883
How's it going?

30:04.936 --> 30:08.929
I'm Bill. This is Ted.
We're from the future.

30:11.309 --> 30:12.776
Socrates.

30:14.679 --> 30:15.941
Now what?

30:17.382 --> 30:18.849
I don't know.

30:20.084 --> 30:21.949
Philosophize with him.

30:28.026 --> 30:32.486
<i>"</i> All we are is dust in the wind,<i>"</i> dude.

30:40.638 --> 30:41.730
Dust.

30:43.608 --> 30:44.700
Wind.

30:44.976 --> 30:45.965
Dude.

30:58.189 --> 31:00.384
Let's get out of here, dude.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.165
All right!

31:17.242 --> 31:19.107
Not bad, eh, So-crates?

31:20.612 --> 31:24.605
- Where are we, dude?
- England, 15th century.

31:24.983 --> 31:27.747
We are in most excellent shape
for our report.

31:27.819 --> 31:30.447
Yeah, all we need is one
more speaker from Medieval.

31:30.521 --> 31:31.818
Excellent.

31:32.023 --> 31:35.584
Billy, you are dealing with
the oddity of time travel...

31:35.660 --> 31:37.685
...with the greatest of ease.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.228
Excuse me.

31:40.698 --> 31:42.757
Do you know where
there are any personages...

31:42.834 --> 31:45.632
...of historical significance around here?

31:52.844 --> 31:54.311
Check it out!

31:56.314 --> 31:58.373
Must be the castle of King Henry.

31:59.117 --> 32:00.641
Let's go, dude!

32:02.387 --> 32:04.412
Billy, guard the booth.

32:05.223 --> 32:07.054
And watch So-crates.

32:12.497 --> 32:15.091
Who should we get for Medieval?

32:17.035 --> 32:19.526
How about that gnarly old goat dude?

32:23.808 --> 32:25.275
I'm in love, dude.

32:32.250 --> 32:36.687
Those must be the princesses
you told yourself about at the Circle K.

32:38.323 --> 32:42.225
We gotta go.
It's a history report, not a babe report.

32:42.961 --> 32:44.360
But, Bill...

32:45.229 --> 32:47.561
Those are historical babes.

32:49.701 --> 32:50.725
Okay.

32:51.235 --> 32:55.331
You're the ladies' man.
How are we gonna meet them?

33:04.916 --> 33:06.247
Excellent!

33:14.625 --> 33:16.718
- Bill.
- What?

33:16.794 --> 33:18.989
- These are heavy.
- Yeah.

33:19.163 --> 33:20.562
Heavy metal.

33:26.838 --> 33:29.534
- We better go find the princesses.
- Yeah.

33:30.742 --> 33:32.004
Watch it!

33:32.643 --> 33:34.941
Who turned out all the lights?

33:35.880 --> 33:38.781
- What?
- I'm Darth Ted.

33:40.518 --> 33:44.614
I'm Luke Bill.
And you're not my father! No!

33:46.924 --> 33:48.152
Come on!

33:49.894 --> 33:52.488
Beat you, I will, yes!

33:57.869 --> 34:01.168
- I totally conquered you, dude!
- No way!

34:01.739 --> 34:02.967
Come on!

34:04.609 --> 34:07.203
I'll never rule the universe with you!

34:09.514 --> 34:10.844
- Bill!
- What?

34:10.915 --> 34:13.782
- We totally know how to sword fight!
- Yeah!

34:41.045 --> 34:43.842
Search the castle! There might be more!

35:18.616 --> 35:20.208
Get out of here!

35:25.990 --> 35:27.150
Bogus.

35:29.694 --> 35:30.922
Heinous.

35:34.732 --> 35:36.859
Most non-triumphant.

35:44.742 --> 35:46.642
Don't be dead, dude.

35:55.853 --> 35:59.254
You killed Ted, you medieval dickweed!

36:23.848 --> 36:25.907
Ted! You're alive!

36:25.983 --> 36:29.214
Yeah! I fell out of my suit
when I hit the floor.

36:31.956 --> 36:33.287
Fag!

36:34.225 --> 36:37.217
Dude, you totally boned that dude
in the head!

36:37.828 --> 36:39.625
He's a total bonehead!

36:39.897 --> 36:43.594
He's a fat old man. There must be a way
to escape before the night falls.

36:43.668 --> 36:44.896
But how?

36:46.437 --> 36:47.563
What's that?

36:49.740 --> 36:52.937
Those boys. I can't believe they're here.

36:55.980 --> 36:57.572
How's it going, ladies?

36:59.717 --> 37:01.685
You're the ones
we saw in front of the castle.

37:04.088 --> 37:07.114
I am Ted of San Dimas.

37:08.092 --> 37:11.926
And I bring to you a message of love.

37:14.532 --> 37:15.692
From who?

37:17.735 --> 37:19.259
From myself.

37:20.037 --> 37:22.028
And what is this message you speak of?

37:25.209 --> 37:28.201
Lyrics, dude. Recite them some lyrics.

37:32.783 --> 37:35.684
O you beautiful babes from England...

37:36.420 --> 37:38.445
...for whom we have
traveled through time...

37:40.057 --> 37:42.355
...will you go to the prom with us
in San Dimas?

37:42.426 --> 37:44.690
We will have a most triumphant time.

37:45.563 --> 37:47.224
Way to go, dude.

37:48.566 --> 37:50.158
It's Father!

38:00.111 --> 38:01.703
What does your father want?

38:01.779 --> 38:04.270
We're to be married to
two horrible old men today.

38:04.348 --> 38:05.542
No way!

38:06.317 --> 38:08.376
Will you help us escape?

38:09.387 --> 38:11.014
Of course, babes.

38:16.127 --> 38:18.561
How's it going, royal ugly dudes?

38:22.333 --> 38:24.631
I'm the Earl of Preston.

38:25.436 --> 38:28.599
And I am the Duke of Ted.

38:42.053 --> 38:44.521
Put them in the iron maiden.

38:45.556 --> 38:48.320
Iron maiden? Excellent!

38:49.727 --> 38:50.955
Execute them.

38:52.096 --> 38:53.586
Bogus.

38:55.900 --> 38:57.197
We'll save you, babes!

39:00.671 --> 39:03.834
Witches! Heretics! I saw them!

39:04.208 --> 39:06.039
They fell from the sky!

39:06.377 --> 39:07.742
Heretics!

39:08.579 --> 39:10.513
They fell out of the sky!

39:11.315 --> 39:15.115
They had fire in their eyes
and they had horns!

39:24.962 --> 39:26.259
Off with their heads!

39:32.269 --> 39:34.237
- Bill?
- What?

39:34.638 --> 39:39.234
I believe our adventure through time
has taken a most serious turn.

39:50.821 --> 39:52.516
- Billy!
- So-crates!

39:52.923 --> 39:54.288
Let's go!

39:55.960 --> 39:57.928
Guards! After them!

39:58.162 --> 40:00.460
- So-crates!
- Bye, babes!

40:03.033 --> 40:04.591
Catch you later, evil dudes.

40:05.736 --> 40:07.670
Kill them! Guards!

40:16.213 --> 40:17.578
Hurry up!

40:18.716 --> 40:20.115
Out of the way!

41:05.996 --> 41:07.190
Dial fast, dude!

41:10.234 --> 41:13.067
<i>The number you have</i>
<i>dialed is not in service at this time.</i>

41:13.137 --> 41:16.004
<i>Please check your directory and dial again.</i>

41:16.073 --> 41:17.404
<i>Party on, dude.</i>

41:24.148 --> 41:25.775
Okay, I got one! Let's go!

42:00.284 --> 42:01.945
You guys stay here.

42:04.955 --> 42:06.684
Where are we, dude?

42:07.825 --> 42:09.292
I don't know.

42:10.761 --> 42:15.289
- Sure do play excellent music.
- Most outstanding.

42:35.119 --> 42:38.748
- It's you.
- Yeah. It's us.

42:40.090 --> 42:41.455
Who are we?

43:32.142 --> 43:34.838
I think they want us to say something.

43:35.279 --> 43:36.940
What should I say?

43:38.182 --> 43:39.979
Make something up.

43:48.125 --> 43:50.719
Be excellent to each other.

43:57.334 --> 43:59.063
Party on, dudes.

44:00.237 --> 44:01.704
Good one, dude.

44:08.145 --> 44:10.306
Got to get back to our report.

44:10.381 --> 44:14.317
Yeah. We'd take you with us,
but it's a history report...

44:14.385 --> 44:16.148
...not a future report.

44:19.590 --> 44:20.818
Later.

44:21.725 --> 44:22.987
Later.

44:26.330 --> 44:29.629
- Let's get back and do our report.
- Good idea.

44:47.584 --> 44:51.850
- Dude! Where are we going?
- I don't know! I think the booth's broke!

44:51.989 --> 44:55.550
We've got to keep dialing San Dimas
until we get back and get Napoleon.

44:58.562 --> 45:00.427
Behold.

45:00.764 --> 45:01.924
The Zyggie Pig.

45:01.999 --> 45:05.662
The single greatest ice-cream spectacle
known to man.

45:05.736 --> 45:10.173
<i>"</i> Eat the Pig, eat the Pig,
zyggie, zyggie, zyggie, zyg!<i>"</i>

45:14.178 --> 45:15.668
<i>Embêtants!</i>

45:18.449 --> 45:19.882
It's ice cream.

45:20.851 --> 45:22.216
You eat it.

45:23.353 --> 45:24.684
It's good.

45:26.957 --> 45:27.981
<i>La glace.</i>

45:29.193 --> 45:30.592
Whatever. Just eat it.

45:51.515 --> 45:52.812
All behold!

45:52.883 --> 45:56.785
- He ate the Pig, thus proving that he's...
- A...

45:56.854 --> 45:59.846
<i>"</i> Zyggie piggy!<i>"</i>

46:17.674 --> 46:19.073
What's that?

46:23.046 --> 46:24.513
I don't know.

46:28.719 --> 46:31.153
Shit!

46:54.111 --> 46:56.079
Where did we land now?

46:57.047 --> 46:59.345
Dude, it's Sigmund Frood.

47:00.017 --> 47:01.951
How much time we got left?

47:02.252 --> 47:04.083
Tons. Why?

47:04.888 --> 47:06.617
Extra credit, dude.

47:10.360 --> 47:12.123
How's it going, Frood dude?

47:21.305 --> 47:25.036
What is this? Let go of me.
What are you doing?

48:04.448 --> 48:07.349
<i>Was? Was ist los?</i>

48:08.018 --> 48:09.645
Come on, So-crates.

48:59.303 --> 49:01.567
Welcome aboard, Miss Joan of Arc.

49:01.772 --> 49:04.332
My name is Ted and this is Bill.

49:31.735 --> 49:33.965
Want a Twinkie, Genghis Khan?

49:34.304 --> 49:35.862
Say please.

49:38.442 --> 49:40.501
Come on, guys. Jump him!

49:45.415 --> 49:46.439
Candygram!

49:57.761 --> 49:59.422
Yes, what can I...

50:06.970 --> 50:10.997
We've got plenty of time,
but we don't have any more room left.

50:11.074 --> 50:13.269
- Ted, we're out of control.
- What?

50:13.343 --> 50:14.503
Next place we stop...

50:14.578 --> 50:18.173
...we gotta try and figure out
what's wrong with the booth.

50:25.288 --> 50:28.917
Bill, I think I got an idea what's wrong.

50:29.226 --> 50:30.352
What?

50:30.761 --> 50:32.592
The antenna's broken.

50:41.304 --> 50:42.896
Yeah. All right.

51:11.868 --> 51:13.096
<i>Attends.</i>

51:17.707 --> 51:18.696
<i>Crétin.</i>

51:36.026 --> 51:37.994
Come on, let's ditch him.

51:43.667 --> 51:46.067
<i>Attends!</i>

51:47.704 --> 51:48.932
<i>Attends!</i>

51:51.374 --> 51:55.174
<i>- Excusez-moi, monsieur.</i>
- Hold on there. Not so fast, buddy.

51:55.779 --> 51:58.304
- <i>"</i> Buddy <i>"</i> ?
- You ain't paid yet.

51:58.682 --> 52:01.014
- Pay?
- Pay.

52:05.622 --> 52:08.523
I don't want to see
you around here anymore! Beat it!

52:08.592 --> 52:11.823
<i>- Vous me connaissez, monsieur?</i>
- Beat it, buddy!

52:13.396 --> 52:14.556
<i>Idiot!</i>

52:31.515 --> 52:32.675
Deacon!

52:42.859 --> 52:46.920
Here is a treat to make
our minor prehistoric pit stop...

52:47.631 --> 52:49.428
...a bit more enjoyable.

52:51.201 --> 52:52.600
Why, thank you.

53:21.331 --> 53:22.798
Thanks, guys.

53:26.203 --> 53:28.103
I sure hope this works.

53:42.752 --> 53:44.777
I think it's working, dude.

53:57.667 --> 54:00.659
Just a little farther, I hope.

54:09.412 --> 54:12.347
That's us. We're back in San Dimas!

54:12.616 --> 54:16.450
Yeah. Only now it's not now,
it's last night.

54:16.820 --> 54:17.809
Dude.

54:17.887 --> 54:20.720
- What?
- Let's go talk to ourselves.

54:20.790 --> 54:22.121
Excellent.

54:22.192 --> 54:26.595
- What did we say, anyways?
- I don't know. Let's go find out.

54:27.631 --> 54:29.496
Sixty-nine, dudes!

54:33.003 --> 54:34.937
Look, dudes, we gotta go.

54:37.741 --> 54:40.972
Listen to this dude Rufus.
He knows what he's talking about.

54:41.044 --> 54:45.447
Right. And, Ted,
give my love to the princesses.

54:46.116 --> 54:48.710
- Who?
- You'll see.

54:50.153 --> 54:52.713
Gentlemen, is everything all right?

54:52.789 --> 54:56.247
Yeah, except how come
the number we dialed for San Dimas...

54:56.326 --> 54:59.090
...brought us here
instead of to tomorrow, Rufus?

54:59.162 --> 55:02.222
Because in San Dimas
it is tomorrow, William.

55:02.299 --> 55:04.665
You have to dial one number higher.

55:05.769 --> 55:08.397
Yeah. Thanks, Rufus.

55:08.772 --> 55:11.104
And hurry,
because you don't have much time.

55:11.174 --> 55:14.075
What do you mean, Rufus?
We got 10 hours left.

55:14.978 --> 55:16.878
You got two hours.

55:17.580 --> 55:22.517
Ted, you forgot to wind your watch again.
And after you reminded yourself not to.

55:22.719 --> 55:27.679
I better remind myself again.
Don't forget to wind your watch!

55:29.292 --> 55:30.850
Thanks, Rufus.

55:33.063 --> 55:34.963
Catch you later, Bill and Ted.

55:36.766 --> 55:39.030
That conversation
made more sense this time.

55:39.102 --> 55:42.094
- Watch the gonads, dude.
- Abe, you're too tall, man.

55:42.405 --> 55:44.737
That's just the way I'm built.

55:54.845 --> 55:56.176
Great, we made it!

55:57.581 --> 56:00.846
<i>Who's the señorita? She's cute.</i>

56:00.918 --> 56:02.647
It's his mom, dude.

56:06.290 --> 56:07.348
Hi, guys.

56:07.458 --> 56:09.483
Hi, Missy, I mean, Mom.

56:11.261 --> 56:14.890
Miss Preston,
we'd like you to meet some of our friends.

56:14.965 --> 56:18.162
Yeah, this is Dave Beeth Oven.

56:19.036 --> 56:20.503
<i>Sie sind so schön, Madame.</i>

56:20.637 --> 56:24.505
And Maxine of Arc, Missy.

56:25.642 --> 56:27.166
Herman the Kid.

56:28.011 --> 56:29.410
Bob Genghis Khan.

56:30.414 --> 56:32.507
So-crates Johnson.

56:32.983 --> 56:34.712
Dennis Frood.

56:35.085 --> 56:36.416
And...

56:39.056 --> 56:40.648
Abraham Lincoln.

56:41.592 --> 56:45.358
It's nice to meet you all.
There are sodas in the fridge.

56:47.331 --> 56:49.196
Can you give us a ride someplace?

56:49.266 --> 56:52.429
Bill, I'm not taking you anywhere
until you do your chores.

57:28.972 --> 57:30.633
Done!

57:32.376 --> 57:34.708
This is the San Dimas Mall...

57:34.845 --> 57:38.042
...and this is where
people of today's world hang out.

57:39.116 --> 57:41.584
All right, everybody,
watch your step getting off.

57:41.652 --> 57:44.815
Beeth Oven,
make sure you don't get sucked under.

57:47.157 --> 57:50.388
Everybody get together.
Remember who your buddy is.

57:51.128 --> 57:54.029
So-crates, watch out for your robe, dude.

57:56.767 --> 57:57.791
Okay.

57:59.069 --> 58:00.502
Follow me.

58:00.571 --> 58:03.938
You got your Broadway down here,
you got your Sears over here.

58:04.541 --> 58:08.841
<i>The stratification of our society</i>
<i>is much like Marie-Antoinette's.</i>

58:08.912 --> 58:10.436
<i>The few possess much...</i>

58:10.814 --> 58:14.181
<i>... while the masses possess little</i>
<i>but their television sets.</i>

58:14.318 --> 58:16.582
<i>This dichotomy led to a revolution...</i>

58:16.653 --> 58:19.622
<i>... in which Antoinette</i>
<i>and her husband were beheaded.</i>

58:19.690 --> 58:22.250
<i>Today, leaders are impeached</i>
<i>rather than beheaded.</i>

58:23.227 --> 58:27.721
<i>Still, while in her day, Marie-Antoinette</i>
<i>said, "Let them eat cake..."</i>

58:27.798 --> 58:30.926
<i>... perhaps today she'd say,</i>
<i>"Let them eat fast food."</i>

58:36.940 --> 58:40.432
- Enjoy!
- Okay, look around. See what you think.

58:40.911 --> 58:43.277
We'll be back as soon as
we find Napoleon, okay?

58:44.047 --> 58:46.607
Come on, dude. We don't got much time.

58:46.683 --> 58:48.776
Yes, but what do we eat?

58:49.286 --> 58:51.015
You ditched Napoleon?

58:51.889 --> 58:55.950
Do you realize you've stranded one of
Europe's greatest leaders in San Dimas?

58:56.026 --> 58:57.015
He was a dick!

59:01.431 --> 59:03.626
How are we going to find him?

59:06.236 --> 59:07.498
Okay, wait.

59:08.372 --> 59:11.500
If we were one of
the greatest generals in history...

59:11.875 --> 59:14.867
...and we were stranded
in San Dimas for one day...

59:15.779 --> 59:17.440
...where would we go?

59:21.184 --> 59:22.446
Waterloo!

59:35.699 --> 59:39.032
Eleven children, please. Are you okay?

59:43.407 --> 59:44.931
We're going.

59:46.243 --> 59:47.471
Come on.

59:50.814 --> 59:52.247
<i>Mon Dieu.</i>

01:00:09.099 --> 01:00:11.067
<i>Qu'est-ce que c'est ça?</i>

01:00:11.802 --> 01:00:14.202
Buddy, you're holding up the line!

01:00:18.008 --> 01:00:20.499
<i>- Sacrebleu.</i>
- Come on, buddy.

01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:45.093
<i>Fantastique!</i>

01:01:45.162 --> 01:01:48.928
Come on, Napoleon.
Everybody's waiting for us at the mall.

01:01:54.504 --> 01:01:58.634
<i>Why be soft and flabby</i>
<i>when you can be firm and trim?</i>

01:01:58.709 --> 01:02:00.506
<i>When you can have a body that cries:</i>

01:02:00.577 --> 01:02:02.545
<i>"Look at me! Admire me!"</i>

01:02:02.612 --> 01:02:05.513
<i>With our specialized weight-training</i>
<i>and aerobics program...</i>

01:02:05.582 --> 01:02:09.848
<i>... we can help you attain the kind of body</i>
<i>you've only dreamed of having.</i>

01:02:09.953 --> 01:02:12.080
All right, let's go, ladies!

01:02:12.856 --> 01:02:16.087
You guys are looking great! Okay!

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:19.224
Jumping jacks! Up!

01:02:25.001 --> 01:02:26.263
You a musician?

01:02:28.905 --> 01:02:31.237
Here. Try this.

01:02:55.065 --> 01:02:56.498
What is this?

01:02:56.933 --> 01:02:59.629
- Oh, my God.
- What are they doing?

01:02:59.703 --> 01:03:02.763
Yeah, don't you think? Look at his sandals.

01:03:04.574 --> 01:03:06.542
I don't believe his clothes.

01:03:06.877 --> 01:03:09.869
- Weird.
- They're coming over to sit down.

01:03:12.449 --> 01:03:13.473
Hi.

01:03:13.884 --> 01:03:15.215
I'm Billy.

01:03:15.952 --> 01:03:17.681
This here is So-crates.

01:03:17.754 --> 01:03:19.619
- Socrates.
- We're from history.

01:03:22.692 --> 01:03:27.186
Hello. I'm Dr. Freud,
but you may call me Siggy.

01:03:27.731 --> 01:03:30.529
Oh, my God.

01:03:31.001 --> 01:03:34.801
You both seem to be suffering
from a mild form of hysteria.

01:03:34.871 --> 01:03:37.999
- God!
- You are such a geek.

01:03:41.578 --> 01:03:43.409
Way to go, egghead.

01:03:45.549 --> 01:03:48.541
- Geek.
- What is a geek?

01:04:21.484 --> 01:04:23.247
I need help. I got a live one here.

01:04:27.557 --> 01:04:30.890
Okay, I need the Lincoln hat
and the stupid beard back.

01:04:30.961 --> 01:04:34.397
You don't understand.
I'm Abraham Lincoln.

01:04:34.865 --> 01:04:37.766
Yeah, right. Come on, mister!

01:04:37.834 --> 01:04:40.428
- It's my hat and my beard!
- Come on!

01:04:48.979 --> 01:04:51.413
Keep it up! You're looking great!

01:05:10.166 --> 01:05:12.760
- Take it easy there!
- Stop! Hold it right there!

01:05:12.836 --> 01:05:14.463
Cut that guy off!

01:05:18.508 --> 01:05:19.668
Stop him!

01:05:33.056 --> 01:05:36.025
- No, Sig! Over here!
- Excuse me, miss.

01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:39.060
- Move.
- Pardon me.

01:05:41.498 --> 01:05:45.093
<i>- I demand einen lawyer.</i>
- Don't get smart, buddy. Let's go.

01:06:01.918 --> 01:06:03.681
There they are!

01:06:12.128 --> 01:06:14.153
All right, come on, grandpa.

01:06:18.435 --> 01:06:19.595
Bogus!

01:06:22.906 --> 01:06:24.464
That's enough.

01:06:32.983 --> 01:06:35.110
Mom, can't you go any faster?

01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:54.631
I want to know
why you claim to be Sigmund Freud.

01:06:55.205 --> 01:06:57.400
Why do you claim I'm not Sigmund Freud?

01:06:57.540 --> 01:07:00.270
Why do you
keep asking me these questions?

01:07:01.311 --> 01:07:02.903
Tell me about your mother.

01:07:03.546 --> 01:07:04.774
God.

01:07:05.015 --> 01:07:08.507
- Would you like a couch to lie on?
- No, I don't want a couch to lie on.

01:07:15.959 --> 01:07:19.224
- All right. What's your name?
- Abraham Lincoln.

01:07:19.696 --> 01:07:22.688
That's L-I-N-C-O-L-N.

01:07:23.666 --> 01:07:25.361
I know how to spell <i>"</i> Lincoln.<i>"</i>

01:07:28.038 --> 01:07:30.097
What's your birthday, Mr. Lincoln?

01:07:30.273 --> 01:07:34.004
February 12, 1809.

01:07:37.414 --> 01:07:40.008
<i>Everything is different, but the same.</i>

01:07:41.217 --> 01:07:44.277
<i>Things are more moderner than before.</i>

01:07:44.487 --> 01:07:45.749
<i>Bigger...</i>

01:07:46.756 --> 01:07:48.690
<i>... and yet smaller.</i>

01:07:52.796 --> 01:07:54.457
<i>There's computers.</i>

01:07:59.436 --> 01:08:00.698
Take your time.

01:08:01.538 --> 01:08:04.006
<i>San Dimas high-school football rules!</i>

01:08:18.388 --> 01:08:21.118
I can't believe my dad arrested them all.

01:08:22.759 --> 01:08:24.158
What are we going to do?

01:08:24.227 --> 01:08:27.594
You go in and talk to your dad.
I'm gonna scope the place out.

01:08:27.663 --> 01:08:31.225
Missy, I mean, Mom,
please keep an eye on Napoleon.

01:08:33.803 --> 01:08:34.792
Stay.

01:08:39.542 --> 01:08:42.773
- Lock him up with the rest of the wackos.
- I am a lawyer, you know.

01:08:42.845 --> 01:08:45.609
- Dad!
- You pack your bags.

01:08:46.216 --> 01:08:47.944
- What?
- You're going to military school.

01:08:48.017 --> 01:08:50.008
- But, Dad...
- I don't wanna hear it!

01:08:50.953 --> 01:08:53.582
You go home and you pack your bags now!

01:09:01.131 --> 01:09:02.792
- How'd it go?
- Bad.

01:09:02.866 --> 01:09:07.359
Our historical figures are all locked up
and my dad won't let them out.

01:09:07.604 --> 01:09:09.299
Can we get your dad's keys?

01:09:09.372 --> 01:09:12.738
We could steal them,
but he lost them two days ago.

01:09:12.809 --> 01:09:17.337
If only we could go back in time
to when he had them and steal 'em then.

01:09:18.548 --> 01:09:21.278
- Why can't we?
- 'Cause we don't got time.

01:09:21.451 --> 01:09:23.385
We could do it after the report.

01:09:24.587 --> 01:09:26.145
Good thinking, dude!

01:09:26.221 --> 01:09:28.850
After the report,
we'll time travel back to two days ago...

01:09:28.925 --> 01:09:30.893
...steal the keys and leave them here!

01:09:31.627 --> 01:09:35.029
- Where?
- Don't know. How about behind that sign?

01:09:35.865 --> 01:09:39.595
That way, when we get here now,
they'll be waiting for us.

01:09:41.470 --> 01:09:43.803
- See?
- Yeah!

01:09:43.939 --> 01:09:48.274
So, after the report, we can't forget
to do this, otherwise it won't happen.

01:09:48.344 --> 01:09:51.904
But it did happen!
It was me who stole my dad's keys!

01:09:52.148 --> 01:09:54.207
That's exactly it. Come on.

01:09:57.921 --> 01:09:59.183
- Mom?
- Yes?

01:09:59.656 --> 01:10:02.181
- Can you please bring the car around back?
- Sure.

01:10:03.893 --> 01:10:07.454
Come on. We've got some
historical figures to rescue.

01:10:08.364 --> 01:10:09.831
Over and out.

01:10:25.782 --> 01:10:28.273
How are we going to get past my dad?

01:10:29.252 --> 01:10:32.153
- You got a tape recorder at home?
- Yeah.

01:10:33.089 --> 01:10:37.025
- Remember to get the tape recorder.
- Yeah.

01:10:37.093 --> 01:10:39.186
Set a timer on it for...

01:10:40.263 --> 01:10:41.355
2:13.

01:10:41.598 --> 01:10:43.429
- Got it?
- Got it.

01:10:46.102 --> 01:10:48.798
- What am I going to say on it?
<i>- Dad!</i>

01:10:50.073 --> 01:10:51.097
<i>Hey, Dad!</i>

01:10:51.741 --> 01:10:53.265
It's you, dude.

01:10:57.647 --> 01:11:00.013
- Ted?
<i>- I'm over here.</i>

01:11:02.619 --> 01:11:04.917
<i>Yeah, this way!</i>

01:11:26.876 --> 01:11:28.366
Look! Check it out.

01:11:30.613 --> 01:11:32.240
<i>"</i> Dear Bill and Ted.

01:11:32.348 --> 01:11:33.975
<i>"</i> Good luck on the report.

01:11:34.050 --> 01:11:38.544
<i>"</i> Sincerely, Bill S. Preston, Esquire
and Ted 'Theodore' Logan.<i>"</i>

01:11:38.955 --> 01:11:40.115
That was nice of us.

01:11:40.857 --> 01:11:42.051
<i>"</i> P.S.

01:11:42.692 --> 01:11:43.852
<i>"</i> Duck!<i>"</i>

01:11:49.132 --> 01:11:50.224
Excellent work, dude.

01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:52.165
- Way to go!
- Come on.

01:12:06.015 --> 01:12:08.540
<i>- Merci.</i>
- People, time is of the essence.

01:12:08.618 --> 01:12:12.054
I ask that you all work together
so that we can get down to the car.

01:12:12.121 --> 01:12:13.884
Very quiet. Quiet!

01:12:15.992 --> 01:12:18.654
Against the wall, everybody, please.
Single file.

01:12:19.462 --> 01:12:22.556
- Hurry up, Billy.
- How do we get out of here?

01:12:22.899 --> 01:12:24.423
<i>Over here, Dad!</i>

01:12:24.834 --> 01:12:25.960
<i>Down here!</i>

01:12:26.035 --> 01:12:28.367
<i>Way to go, dude. You stalled him.</i>

01:12:28.438 --> 01:12:30.201
<i>What else do I say?</i>

01:12:30.273 --> 01:12:34.972
<i>And now, opening for Iron Maiden,</i>
<i>Wyld Stallyns!</i>

01:12:39.015 --> 01:12:41.313
Come on, put your back into it.

01:12:41.984 --> 01:12:44.214
What in the hell do you think you're doing?

01:12:44.754 --> 01:12:49.214
- Trashcan. Remember a trashcan.
- Trashcan? What are you talking about?

01:12:49.692 --> 01:12:51.216
Get this thing off me!

01:12:51.728 --> 01:12:55.596
Sorry, Dad,
but we got to go pass our history report.

01:12:56.699 --> 01:12:58.758
By the way, I found your keys.

01:12:59.135 --> 01:13:01.501
Where are you? Get this off me!

01:13:08.544 --> 01:13:12.913
<i>In conclusion, I think Abraham Lincoln</i>
<i>would be most impressed...</i>

01:13:12.982 --> 01:13:16.509
<i>... with the world of San Dimas.</i>
<i>I know I am.</i>

01:13:26.996 --> 01:13:30.397
Down the hall, to the left. Quiet.

01:13:31.934 --> 01:13:35.529
And I'm sure I speak
for Mr. Ward and Mrs. Rowe...

01:13:36.005 --> 01:13:38.940
...when I say that your reports
were very entertaining...

01:13:39.008 --> 01:13:41.442
...and very informative for all of us.

01:13:42.011 --> 01:13:44.775
It seems we may be
one report short today...

01:13:45.047 --> 01:13:47.379
...so we'll leave just a bit early.

01:13:49.318 --> 01:13:52.583
But once again, I want to thank you all
for your very hard work.

01:13:54.557 --> 01:13:56.616
Who turned out the lights?

01:13:59.562 --> 01:14:01.393
<i>Hello, San Dimas.</i>

01:14:01.898 --> 01:14:05.698
<i>Please welcome,</i>
<i>for the final report of the afternoon...</i>

01:14:06.002 --> 01:14:08.027
<i>... from all throughout history...</i>

01:14:08.137 --> 01:14:11.334
<i>... some of the greatest people</i>
<i>who have ever lived...</i>

01:14:11.808 --> 01:14:15.642
<i>... in their 1988 world tour!</i>

01:14:23.953 --> 01:14:25.477
How's it going?

01:14:26.022 --> 01:14:27.319
I'm Billy the Kid.

01:14:40.670 --> 01:14:43.571
I'd like you all to put your hands together.

01:14:50.379 --> 01:14:52.904
Now, my good friends...

01:14:54.016 --> 01:14:57.247
...Bill S. Preston, Esquire...

01:14:57.386 --> 01:15:00.014
...and Ted <i>"</i> Theodore <i>"</i> Logan.

01:15:01.424 --> 01:15:02.823
Thank you.

01:15:04.227 --> 01:15:06.354
Hello, San Dimas High.

01:15:07.330 --> 01:15:10.697
Mr. Ryan,
fellow distinguished classmates...

01:15:10.833 --> 01:15:12.926
...teachers, babes.

01:15:13.970 --> 01:15:18.930
- Our first speaker was born in 470 B.C.
- Hi! Long time no see.

01:15:19.809 --> 01:15:21.709
A time when much of the world...

01:15:21.777 --> 01:15:25.235
...looked like the cover of
<i>the Led Zeppelin album Houses of the Holy.</i>

01:15:25.648 --> 01:15:30.608
We were there. There were many steps
and columns. It was most tranquil.

01:15:31.487 --> 01:15:34.786
He is sometimes known
as the father of modern thought.

01:15:35.091 --> 01:15:39.027
He was the teacher of Plato,
who was in turn the teacher of Aristotle.

01:15:39.161 --> 01:15:44.121
And like Ozzy Osbourne, was repeatedly
accused of corruption of the young.

01:15:44.934 --> 01:15:46.925
And since he doesn't speak English...

01:15:47.003 --> 01:15:49.904
...my friend Ted, here,
is gonna interpret for him.

01:15:49.972 --> 01:15:53.169
So please welcome,
to tell us what he thinks of San Dimas...

01:15:53.242 --> 01:15:56.803
...the most bodacious
philosophizer in ancient Greece...

01:15:57.146 --> 01:15:58.807
...Socrates!

01:16:01.484 --> 01:16:04.817
...totally out of control.
I've got a good idea where he gets it.

01:16:04.887 --> 01:16:09.847
If you and your wife used a little discipline,
your son wouldn't be such a bad influence.

01:16:09.926 --> 01:16:11.917
Is discipline your key to success with Ted?

01:16:11.994 --> 01:16:14.861
Yes, it is! He's going to
an Alaskan military school.

01:16:15.298 --> 01:16:18.131
...loves you best...

01:16:20.770 --> 01:16:22.397
...in all the world.

01:16:23.339 --> 01:16:25.307
What are they doing up there?

01:16:26.442 --> 01:16:29.900
He also loves baseball.

01:16:31.247 --> 01:16:34.944
Therefore, Ted's father's
own fear of failure...

01:16:35.251 --> 01:16:38.516
...has caused him
to make his son the embodiment...

01:16:38.688 --> 01:16:43.648
...of all of his own deepest anxieties
about himself.

01:16:44.627 --> 01:16:49.030
And hence,
his aggression transference onto Ted.

01:16:53.603 --> 01:16:54.592
Okay?

01:16:57.006 --> 01:16:59.998
Yes.
Thank you very much, Sigmund Freud.

01:17:03.746 --> 01:17:06.772
No, just got a minor Oedipal complex.

01:17:08.884 --> 01:17:11.546
It is indeed a pleasure
to introduce to you...

01:17:11.721 --> 01:17:14.849
...a gentleman we picked up
in medieval Mongolia...

01:17:14.924 --> 01:17:16.915
...in the year 1269.

01:17:17.493 --> 01:17:20.485
Please welcome,
the very excellent barbarian...

01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:23.121
...Mr. Genghis Khan!

01:17:26.502 --> 01:17:29.528
This is a dude who, 700 years ago...

01:17:30.039 --> 01:17:34.203
...totally ravaged China,
and who, we are told, two hours ago...

01:17:34.276 --> 01:17:36.870
...totally ravaged
Oshman's Sporting Goods.

01:17:39.181 --> 01:17:42.912
A most bodacious soldier and general...

01:17:42.985 --> 01:17:46.443
...Miss Of Arc totally rousted
the English from France.

01:17:46.889 --> 01:17:50.222
And then she turned this dude,
Dauphin, into a king.

01:17:50.459 --> 01:17:53.087
And all this by the time she was 17.

01:17:54.363 --> 01:17:57.730
<i>Je vais remporter un triomphe terrible...</i>

01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:00.768
<i>... en Russie...</i>

01:18:01.537 --> 01:18:04.870
<i>... avec mes waterslides.</i>

01:18:06.075 --> 01:18:09.374
The music of Ludwig von Beethoven.

01:18:12.982 --> 01:18:15.610
As you can see,
Genghis very much enjoys Twinkies...

01:18:15.685 --> 01:18:17.812
...because of the excellent sugar rush.

01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:20.984
He also loves billiards.

01:18:23.092 --> 01:18:26.619
Beethoven's favorite works include
<i>Mozart's Requiem...</i>

01:18:26.696 --> 01:18:30.188
<i>... Handel's Messiah,</i>
<i>and Bon Jovi's Slippery When Wet.</i>

01:18:31.233 --> 01:18:35.966
To improve on the condition of her armies,
Joan of Arc plans on instituting...

01:18:36.038 --> 01:18:39.769
...a full-scale aerobics program
on her return to France.

01:18:40.176 --> 01:18:42.644
I don't think it's going to work.

01:18:46.682 --> 01:18:48.377
<i>Triomphe, Napoléon!</i>

01:18:54.957 --> 01:18:56.322
He loves...

01:18:57.827 --> 01:18:59.852
He loves San Dimas.

01:19:09.638 --> 01:19:12.163
And now, for our last speaker.

01:19:13.576 --> 01:19:18.206
One of the greatest presidents
in American history...

01:19:19.348 --> 01:19:22.511
...Mr. Abraham Lincoln.

01:19:43.405 --> 01:19:45.373
Fourscore and...

01:19:47.710 --> 01:19:49.302
...seven minutes ago...

01:19:50.045 --> 01:19:53.344
...we, your forefathers...

01:19:54.550 --> 01:19:59.146
...were brought forth upon
a most excellent adventure...

01:20:00.689 --> 01:20:04.284
...conceived by our new friends...

01:20:05.728 --> 01:20:06.922
...Bill...

01:20:09.064 --> 01:20:10.395
...and Ted.

01:20:12.468 --> 01:20:15.403
These two great gentlemen...

01:20:16.705 --> 01:20:19.265
...are dedicated to a proposition...

01:20:19.675 --> 01:20:21.666
...which was true in my time...

01:20:22.878 --> 01:20:24.846
...just as it's true today.

01:20:28.951 --> 01:20:32.546
Be excellent to each other.

01:20:34.590 --> 01:20:35.750
And...

01:20:37.293 --> 01:20:39.090
...party on, dudes!

01:20:47.837 --> 01:20:49.600
No way!

01:20:59.849 --> 01:21:01.976
Thank you, San Dimas High.

01:21:32.114 --> 01:21:34.810
We want more!

01:21:41.690 --> 01:21:42.850
Intro.

01:21:43.325 --> 01:21:46.089
I'm Bill S. Preston, Esquire.

01:21:57.873 --> 01:21:59.465
What's up, Ted?

01:22:03.913 --> 01:22:05.881
We traveled through time.

01:22:05.948 --> 01:22:10.908
I mean, we met lots of great leaders
and we got an A plus on our history report.

01:22:12.421 --> 01:22:15.549
And look at us. Nothing's different.

01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:20.391
Maybe it's time we get Eddie Van Halen.

01:22:22.398 --> 01:22:24.559
Maybe we should start
learning how to play.

01:22:25.968 --> 01:22:27.560
Maybe you're right.

01:22:42.952 --> 01:22:46.149
Hello again, my excellent friends.

01:22:48.157 --> 01:22:51.149
Congratulations on
passing your history report.

01:22:52.261 --> 01:22:55.094
Rufus, the babes.

01:22:55.164 --> 01:22:57.462
We looked all over England for you.

01:22:57.533 --> 01:23:00.366
Where'd you get those savory clothes?

01:23:01.437 --> 01:23:04.497
Rufus introduced us to
a place called the mall.

01:23:05.007 --> 01:23:07.339
And something called credit cards.

01:23:08.277 --> 01:23:12.611
I got them out of England just before
they had to marry those royal ugly dudes.

01:23:13.015 --> 01:23:14.642
Way to go, Rufus.

01:23:24.460 --> 01:23:26.792
How can we ever thank you, Rufus?

01:23:26.895 --> 01:23:30.331
You can start by signing this for my kids.

01:23:31.367 --> 01:23:34.495
- Why?
- They're big fans of yours.

01:23:34.903 --> 01:23:37.098
- What?
- Everyone is.

01:23:37.673 --> 01:23:42.076
Wyld Stallyns' music has become
the foundation of our whole society.

01:23:43.846 --> 01:23:45.336
No way!

01:23:45.748 --> 01:23:47.443
Yes way!

01:23:47.850 --> 01:23:52.753
In fact, I believe you were there.
That futuristic place with the domes?

01:23:53.622 --> 01:23:55.283
And the totally excellent music.

01:23:56.725 --> 01:23:58.750
They totally worshipped us there.

01:23:58.927 --> 01:24:00.121
I know.

01:24:00.262 --> 01:24:04.323
That's why I was sent to make sure
you passed your history report.

01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:08.630
If you guys were separated, it would have
been disastrous for life as we know it.

01:24:09.038 --> 01:24:13.702
You see, eventually, your music
will help to end war and poverty.

01:24:14.376 --> 01:24:18.142
It will align the planets
and bring them into universal harmony...

01:24:18.313 --> 01:24:21.146
...allowing meaningful contact
with all forms of life...

01:24:21.617 --> 01:24:26.111
...from extraterrestrial beings
to common household pets.

01:24:26.488 --> 01:24:27.648
And...

01:24:28.724 --> 01:24:30.817
...it's excellent for dancing.

01:24:34.296 --> 01:24:37.129
Why don't you have the ladies sign as well,
would you please?

01:24:37.199 --> 01:24:40.191
- After all, they are in the band.
- They are?

01:24:40.269 --> 01:24:42.897
Excellent!

01:24:43.338 --> 01:24:45.533
Where are you going, Rufus?

01:24:46.208 --> 01:24:48.073
I got a surprise for you.

01:24:57.286 --> 01:24:58.275
Here.

01:24:59.721 --> 01:25:01.951
That's to help you
as you start your new band.

01:25:02.357 --> 01:25:03.722
Thanks, Rufus.

01:25:03.792 --> 01:25:07.421
I just have one further humble request:

01:25:07.763 --> 01:25:11.255
If I might be so honored to jam with you?

01:25:12.301 --> 01:25:15.793
- Do you know how to play, Rufus?
- I play a little.

01:25:39.761 --> 01:25:43.424
- Most outstanding.
- Let's jam.

01:25:51.707 --> 01:25:54.301
- Bill, my friend?
- Yes, Ted, my friend?

01:25:54.376 --> 01:25:57.277
This has been a most excellent adventure.

01:25:58.247 --> 01:25:59.646
- One.
- Two.

01:25:59.715 --> 01:26:01.615
One, two, three, four!

01:26:08.490 --> 01:26:10.219
They do get better.
