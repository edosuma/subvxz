08:04.084 --> 08:05.684
I figure five more years
of game time

08:05.752 --> 08:07.752
Before I can take
the whole fake population

08:07.822 --> 08:08.821
Into fake outer space.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.622
What do we do in outer space?

08:10.691 --> 08:12.156
Nothing. It's fake.
W-we keep going.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.492
The game's map has edges,

08:13.560 --> 08:15.627
But the game's engine
will let us go past them.

08:15.696 --> 08:17.295
That will force the game
to reset,

08:17.364 --> 08:19.832
But first it will kick us out,
which morty should survive.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.100
I mean, whatever amount of morty
we have on board.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.635
So if you don't have
five billion handkerchiefs

08:23.704 --> 08:25.237
Soaked in chloroform,

08:25.305 --> 08:26.905
I hope you can keep
flipping idiots to our cause.

08:26.973 --> 08:28.573
They're not idiots,
grandpa.

08:28.575 --> 08:29.908
They're me.
Ha.

08:29.976 --> 08:31.576
You'll know how funny that is
when we get back.

08:31.578 --> 08:34.112
By the way, I had your genius
of a father picked up.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.848
He's over there.
What? Why?

08:35.916 --> 08:37.716
I thought you'd be grateful
and less distracted

08:37.784 --> 08:39.251
Than if I let him die.

08:39.319 --> 08:41.186
He's been in real bad shape
since he lost his wife --

08:41.255 --> 08:42.521
My mom?

08:42.589 --> 08:44.923
Your not-at-all-real mom,
a mom in a video game.

08:44.991 --> 08:47.059
Occupied by a tiny fraction
of yourself.

08:47.127 --> 08:49.394
A fraction of yourself which is
now dead forever,

08:49.396 --> 08:51.864
And fractions add up,
so I had your dad brought here.

08:51.932 --> 08:54.466
You're welcome,
you heartless monster.

08:54.535 --> 08:56.401
Marta.
It's me, dad.

08:56.403 --> 08:57.602
I converted for you.

08:57.671 --> 08:59.738
My name is morty.
So is yours.

08:59.806 --> 09:00.939
And there's no conversion.

09:01.007 --> 09:02.674
We're both morty.
It's a fact.

09:02.743 --> 09:03.942
Sure, honey,
anything you say.

09:04.010 --> 09:06.411
I don't want to fight.
I'm proud of you.

09:06.413 --> 09:08.146
Are you mad at me
because before you became

09:08.215 --> 09:10.282
The world's most powerful woman,
I shamed you for your haircut

09:10.350 --> 09:12.417
And called you
a slutty jobless hobo?

09:12.419 --> 09:14.953
If I were you, I'd be
a little mad about that.

09:15.021 --> 09:17.489
You are me. A-and why would I
be mad at myself?

09:17.558 --> 09:20.358
Good point! Is there anything
to -- to eat around here?

09:20.427 --> 09:21.894
There's a kitchenette
in the break room.

09:21.962 --> 09:24.429
Oh, a kitchenette you say.
Such red carpet treatment.

09:24.431 --> 09:26.164
Excuse me?
I said thank you, I love it,

09:26.233 --> 09:28.233
We-- we--
we're all part of morty!

09:28.235 --> 09:30.569
Some of us more important parts
than others...

09:30.637 --> 09:33.037
Man, the part of me
that's my father is a [bleep]

09:33.107 --> 09:35.440
That's also gonna be funny
when we get back.

09:35.442 --> 09:37.642
Next time you try to do
a "die hard,"

09:37.711 --> 09:41.313
Don't hide under a long table
like the guy from "die hard."

09:41.382 --> 09:42.381
[ screams ]

09:42.449 --> 09:44.583
Okay, I won't.

09:44.651 --> 09:46.919
I thought you said she doesn't
know how to do a "die hard"!

09:46.987 --> 09:49.388
She doesn't.
She's killing us off
one by one!

09:49.456 --> 09:51.790
What do you expect her to do,
buy us each an ice cream?

09:51.858 --> 09:54.058
Two by two?
She's improvising.

09:54.128 --> 09:56.395
Which is how she's going to
fall right into our trap.

09:56.463 --> 09:58.196
I'm going to wander
the arcade unarmed,

09:58.265 --> 10:01.066
And when she comes across me,
I'll pretend to be a hostage.

10:01.135 --> 10:03.001
And because she hasn't seen
"die hard,"

10:03.069 --> 10:04.803
Instead of handing me
an unloaded gun,

10:04.871 --> 10:06.338
She'll hand me a --
ugh!

10:06.406 --> 10:09.408
"die hard"! "die hard"!
"die hard"!

10:09.476 --> 10:10.943
What the hell was that?!

10:11.011 --> 10:12.210
Summer:<i> "die hard"!</i>
<i> "die hard"!</i>

10:12.279 --> 10:14.146
You can't just keep yelling
"die hard"

10:14.214 --> 10:16.148
Into a walkie talkie and --
ugh!

10:16.216 --> 10:18.483
She threw her
walkie talkie away!

10:18.485 --> 10:20.218
She hates "die hard"!

10:20.287 --> 10:24.089
Which makes her
the ultimate mcclane.

10:24.158 --> 10:26.158
Forget everything you know
about "die hard"

10:26.226 --> 10:28.160
And just go
shoot that bitch!

10:28.228 --> 10:30.895
President leland: Thank you for
meeting with me, mr. Roy.

10:30.965 --> 10:32.631
Half the country hangs
on your every word.

10:32.699 --> 10:34.166
Heck, most of the world.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.100
You're, like, uh,
kind of a pope, I reckon.

10:36.102 --> 10:37.902
L-- I'm not a pope because
it's not a religion.

10:37.972 --> 10:39.571
We're literally
in a video game.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.640
I've heard the message, roy.
You're not on the clock here.

10:41.708 --> 10:43.308
So you want every single person
on a spaceship.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.110
But you got
a bunch of holdouts.

10:45.179 --> 10:47.712
Maybe people that prefer their
leaders a little more elected.

10:47.714 --> 10:48.913
Right. Your voters.

10:48.983 --> 10:50.182
People that like
being told what to do

10:50.250 --> 10:51.449
But don't like
admitting it.

10:51.518 --> 10:52.851
Yeah, not sure
I'd put it that way.

10:52.919 --> 10:54.319
I'm sure you'd put it
a stupid way.

10:54.388 --> 10:55.920
I told you this was
a waste of time.

10:55.922 --> 10:57.922
I've got 92% of you
ready to vamoose.

10:57.924 --> 11:00.859
We're not gonna get the rest
by making deals with parasites.

11:00.927 --> 11:02.661
Mr. President,
roy is rick.

11:02.729 --> 11:05.063
He's not us.
You and I, w-we're morty.

11:05.132 --> 11:06.531
Is that really so hard
to believe?

11:06.533 --> 11:07.800
Kid, I've known it
and I've believed it

11:07.868 --> 11:09.401
Longer than you have.

11:09.470 --> 11:11.269
We both became video game
characters at the same moment,

11:11.338 --> 11:13.472
But I knew the truth before you
dropped your skateboard

11:13.540 --> 11:15.340
And went to your first
cult meeting.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.609
How do you think a guy becomes
a president in this game, honey?

11:17.678 --> 11:18.877
By not paying attention?

11:18.945 --> 11:20.345
Sorry to call you honey,

11:20.347 --> 11:21.746
I know we're both parts
of a 14-year-old boy,

11:21.816 --> 11:24.082
But my part's old-fashioned
and vaguely southern.

11:24.151 --> 11:26.951
I'm confused. If -- if you know
rick is real, why --

11:27.021 --> 11:29.488
Why hold out? Because he's
a rude, entitled [bleep]

11:29.556 --> 11:30.689
He's here to save us.

11:30.757 --> 11:32.757
He -- he could've left the game
and let us die.

11:32.759 --> 11:33.958
He's spent 50 years --

11:34.028 --> 11:36.161
50 years, it's what,
a couple hours to him?

11:36.230 --> 11:38.030
He refuses to leave
without his grandson,

11:38.098 --> 11:39.698
But what's grandson
mean to him?

11:39.766 --> 11:41.166
Sounds like
it means butler.

11:41.235 --> 11:43.101
Someone to "help summer
with her 'die hard,'"

11:43.170 --> 11:44.369
Whatever that means.

11:44.438 --> 11:45.637
I'll tell you what
it doesn't mean.

11:45.706 --> 11:47.439
Fly fishing.
A hug.

11:47.508 --> 11:50.175
A little appreciation for what
is clearly a pretty decent kid.

11:50.177 --> 11:52.511
At least the 8% of him
that makes up the decent half

11:52.579 --> 11:54.847
Of the greatest god damn nation
on the planet.

11:54.915 --> 11:56.114
We're not a person
to him yet.

11:56.183 --> 11:58.183
We're not morty yet.
We-we're divided.

11:58.185 --> 12:00.318
We're divided because some of us
doesn't trust the guy.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.921
What happens to that part of us
when we're all back together?

12:02.989 --> 12:04.256
One morty?
Indivisible?

12:04.324 --> 12:06.124
Under a cranky old
bag of dicks?

12:06.193 --> 12:08.527
A man you can lock in a box
with five billion pieces

12:08.595 --> 12:10.128
Of his own god damn
flesh and blood

12:10.197 --> 12:11.864
For 50 god damn
simulated years

12:11.932 --> 12:14.266
And never hear him say
"I love you"?

12:14.334 --> 12:17.936
Sorry, pumpkin tits,
that dog don't hunt.

12:18.004 --> 12:19.071
Wa-want some heroin?

12:19.139 --> 12:21.306
I-it's a video game,
might as well.

12:24.344 --> 12:25.944
Roy: Just about ready
for launch, kiddo.

12:26.012 --> 12:27.612
I can finally get outta
these clothes.

12:27.614 --> 12:29.214
I don't have nearly
enough pockets.

12:29.216 --> 12:31.015
And it'll be nice to have
my own dick back.

12:31.017 --> 12:33.218
Y-you're fine leaving
8% of me to die?

12:33.220 --> 12:34.953
It's not your finest
8%, morty.

12:35.021 --> 12:36.955
And 8% of anything
is expendable.

12:37.023 --> 12:38.557
8% of pizza is crust.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.959
8% of the snyder cut
was batman dreaming.

12:41.027 --> 12:42.360
I don't know what
that reference is!

12:42.429 --> 12:44.763
We're in a video game!
Not for long, baby!

12:44.831 --> 12:46.364
I'm not leaving
without all of me.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.500
What? Oh, no, let me crunch
these numbers.

12:48.569 --> 12:51.035
8% of five billion
plus one person --

12:51.105 --> 12:53.638
My god, if you stay,
it changes nothing! Bye.

12:53.707 --> 12:55.974
If she's not going, I don't
think my country wants to go.

12:56.042 --> 12:58.243
Who invited you to chime in,
monitor face?

12:58.312 --> 13:00.512
Why give me a monitor
if my opinion doesn't matter?

13:00.581 --> 13:02.915
Your opinion isn't allowed
to matter for the rest of us.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.382
We're all a-morty.

13:04.451 --> 13:05.784
How many chunks of us are we
a-supposed to give up?

13:05.852 --> 13:07.319
Look, I don't know about you,
but I was already

13:07.388 --> 13:09.121
Taking a big leap of faith,
here.

13:09.189 --> 13:10.655
We-we're basically
giving up our lives

13:10.657 --> 13:12.257
To become a tiny part
of a stranger --

13:12.259 --> 13:13.191
These lives
aren't a-real!

13:13.260 --> 13:15.193
Yeah, but they're longer!

13:15.262 --> 13:17.862
What -- what is this,
suicide by summit meeting?

13:17.864 --> 13:20.198
Everyone stop.

13:20.267 --> 13:22.134
Rick,
I'll get every single part of me

To get on every ship
and go with you.
Good.

13:24.271 --> 13:28.473
But you have to tell us
you love us.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.208
I mean, at this point
even if he said it,

13:30.277 --> 13:31.610
