♪ We all go sleeping ♪

00:22.731 --> 00:24.107
-Whoa.
-What you reading?

00:24.190 --> 00:26.693
-The Internet?
-An article about doctors

00:26.776 --> 00:27.736
that go to war zones.

00:27.819 --> 00:29.362
What, like, for vacation?

00:29.446 --> 00:31.072
No, for saving people.

00:31.156 --> 00:34.826
Just makes it seem like
what we do is so trivial.

00:34.909 --> 00:36.244
Oh, not this again.

00:36.327 --> 00:37.412
Think about it.

00:37.495 --> 00:39.873
What we do doesn't make a difference.

00:39.956 --> 00:41.332
What?

00:41.416 --> 00:44.002
We make good food,
and good food makes people happy.

00:44.085 --> 00:47.297
Is making burgers the dumbest thing
we could've done with our lives?

00:47.380 --> 00:48.465
That's it, give me that.

00:48.548 --> 00:51.843
No more screen time.
You get yourself all worked up.

00:51.926 --> 00:53.470
Wait, don't look at the other tabs.

00:53.553 --> 00:56.598
I mean, not mine.
Those were pop-ups.

00:56.681 --> 00:58.933
Oh. Oh! Look at that.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.602
-Bobby...
-Sorry.

01:01.811 --> 01:04.439
So after that, I dreamt
I was in a hot tub and then I woke up,

01:04.522 --> 01:06.649
and I was in a cold sweat.
You ever have that one?

01:06.733 --> 01:08.193
Nah, yeah, I think.

01:08.276 --> 01:10.487
Okay. I'm coming clean.
I didn't really dream that.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.614
Can you imagine how weird
that would be if I did?

01:12.697 --> 01:13.990
You guys need a hand?

01:14.074 --> 01:15.033
-No.
-We're good.

01:15.116 --> 01:16.493
You stay there and chat.

01:16.576 --> 01:17.410
Oh, thank God.

01:17.494 --> 01:19.704
-Uh, welcome to Bob's Burgers.
-Hi.

01:20.372 --> 01:22.624
-Hi.
-Uh, do you remember us?

01:22.707 --> 01:25.126
I do not, I'm sorry.

01:25.210 --> 01:28.463
Oh, well, I'm Connor Coloroso.
And this is Farrah.

01:28.546 --> 01:30.840
-Hello.
-And we had our very first date

01:30.924 --> 01:33.009
-here about three months ago.
-Oh. Uh, good.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.177
Happy anniversary.

01:34.260 --> 01:36.096
It's a funny story. How we met.

01:36.179 --> 01:38.431
We got into a fender-bender
down by Wonder Wharf.

01:38.515 --> 01:41.309
Speed Racer here clipped my bumper
when I was parking.

01:41.393 --> 01:42.435
It's true.

01:42.519 --> 01:43.895
After we exchanged information,

01:43.978 --> 01:45.689
we decided to walk over here for lunch.

01:45.772 --> 01:48.233
I've been clipping her bumper ever since.

01:48.316 --> 01:49.401
- Aw.
- Hm.

01:49.484 --> 01:50.944
-That's fun.
-Well...

01:51.027 --> 01:53.029
what can we get for you lovebirds?

01:53.113 --> 01:53.988
A couple of burgers?

01:54.072 --> 01:56.574
Uh, actually, we came to tell you...

01:56.658 --> 01:57.617
We're engaged!

01:57.701 --> 01:59.035
-That's great.
-Congratulations.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.829
I always knew you two
would make it work.

02:00.912 --> 02:02.497
Let's see that rock, girl.

02:02.580 --> 02:04.416
I heard someone say that on TV.

02:04.499 --> 02:05.458
Is it offensive?

02:05.542 --> 02:07.168
We have a question to ask,

02:07.252 --> 02:09.879
-and we really hope you say yes.
-Will you cater our wedding?

02:09.963 --> 02:11.923
Us? Cater your wedding?

02:12.007 --> 02:13.299
Don't take this the wrong way,

02:13.383 --> 02:15.260
but don't you want your wedding
to be nice?

02:15.343 --> 02:17.387
Of course.
But we're not really into the whole

02:17.470 --> 02:19.681
-"traditional wedding thing."
-Yeah.

02:19.764 --> 02:21.016
I mean, we'd love to,

02:21.099 --> 02:24.102
but we're not really set up
for catering, per se.

02:24.185 --> 02:26.062
-Or very good at it.
-Right.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.856
We sometimes use our kids,

02:27.939 --> 02:29.816
which you might not want.

02:29.899 --> 02:31.693
-What? We're great.
-Oh, no,

02:31.776 --> 02:33.361
we definitely want the kids as well.

02:33.445 --> 02:35.655
Yeah, they brought us our burgers
on that first date.

02:35.739 --> 02:37.282
I have chills. Chills.

02:37.365 --> 02:39.951
You should name your first baby
The Belcher Children.

02:40.035 --> 02:41.453
We really want this.

02:41.536 --> 02:44.789
Something that's meaningful,
instead of a random caterer

02:44.873 --> 02:47.625
with their chicken or their salmon.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.878
That is kind of touching.

02:49.961 --> 02:51.671
It'll be for about 50 people.

02:51.755 --> 02:52.756
We could handle that.

02:52.839 --> 02:55.759
And we're having the wedding by the water,
just outside of Bog Harbor.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.135
Oh, outdoors?

02:57.218 --> 02:59.179
Uh, I guess we could borrow coolers

02:59.262 --> 03:00.513
and rent a gas grill.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.432
Sure you can.
They could cater your wedding

03:02.515 --> 03:04.517
if it's in a ditch by the highway.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.936
That's my wedding spot!
Don't give it away.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.355
When's the big day?

03:08.438 --> 03:09.606
A week from Saturday.

03:09.689 --> 03:11.316
-Huh?
-What? A week from Saturday?

03:11.399 --> 03:12.817
That's not a lot of time to prep.

03:12.901 --> 03:15.236
We're both just really excited,
and we don't wanna wait.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.696
What's the point of waiting?

03:16.780 --> 03:19.032
Nobody gets better looking, huh?
Right, Dad?

03:19.115 --> 03:20.075
-Louise.
-Sorry.

03:20.158 --> 03:22.285
Oh. So romantic.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.496
You know what, let's do it.

03:24.579 --> 03:26.498
-Great!
-Yes! Thank you so much.

03:26.581 --> 03:28.458
-We'll call you with the details.
-Great.

03:28.541 --> 03:30.919
-Bye! They're never gonna make it.
-What?

03:31.002 --> 03:32.837
You said how romantic this is.

03:32.921 --> 03:34.714
What else am I gonna say in front of them?

03:34.798 --> 03:37.509
-What do you have against love?
-Nothing!

03:37.592 --> 03:39.427
How am I excited about this
and you're not?

03:39.511 --> 03:41.721
You love weddings. You love all this.

03:41.805 --> 03:44.057
Three months isn't enough time.

03:44.140 --> 03:46.601
People should live together
for at least 20 years.

03:46.685 --> 03:48.520
Wait, what? 20 years?

03:48.603 --> 03:50.397
Okay, fine. But three months?

03:50.480 --> 03:53.149
You haven't been in a fight yet.
And if you did, it was cute.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.068
You haven't even smelled
each other's farts.

03:55.151 --> 03:57.737
-You're still holding them in.
-You farted on our second date.

03:57.821 --> 03:59.739
Because I knew you were the one.

03:59.823 --> 04:02.742
-Sitting on my lap. For the record.
-You loved it.

04:02.826 --> 04:05.328
If that's all it takes,
I'm married to Dad, too.

04:05.412 --> 04:06.496
And to a bunch of people.

04:06.579 --> 04:10.125
My point is, we didn't get married
three months after that fart.

04:10.208 --> 04:11.835
I think this is great.

04:11.918 --> 04:14.421
The rest of us are excited
for this couple, right, kids?

04:14.504 --> 04:16.131
-Hell yeah.
-No, I'm nine.

04:16.214 --> 04:18.633
Our burgers brought
those people together.

04:18.717 --> 04:20.176
It's kind of beautiful.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.971
You're like a greasy Cupid.
Do me, do me next.

04:23.054 --> 04:25.015
I've been trying for a long time.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.475
Come on, everybody, hands in the middle.

04:27.559 --> 04:30.186
One, two, three, best wedding ever!

04:30.270 --> 04:32.063
No one said it. What happened?

04:32.147 --> 04:33.690
You didn't tell us what to say.

04:33.773 --> 04:35.942
Sorry. "Best wedding ever" on three.

04:36.026 --> 04:37.318
Eh, the moment's passed.

04:37.402 --> 04:38.653
I'll do it with you.

04:38.737 --> 04:40.238
What? You're against this wedding.

04:40.321 --> 04:42.073
I know, but I like to chant.

04:42.157 --> 04:45.076
It's true. I got her to chant,
"herpes, herpes, hooray" once.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.369
Let's do it again.

04:46.453 --> 04:49.789
Herpes, herpes, hooray!

04:49.873 --> 04:50.749
Oh, my God.

04:54.586 --> 04:57.922
This might be the most important day
in our restaurant's history.

04:58.006 --> 04:59.799
Our food helped make
this wedding possible,

04:59.883 --> 05:02.010
and now it's gonna make it a success.

05:02.093 --> 05:04.512
If the marriage tanks, is that our fault?

05:04.596 --> 05:05.597
I blame the buns.

05:05.680 --> 05:08.266
You can't blame our food
if this marriage doesn't work.

05:08.350 --> 05:11.102
-They're the ones rushing into this.
-The marriage is gonna work.

05:11.186 --> 05:12.937
Carter and Farrah have a love

05:13.021 --> 05:15.357
that burns brighter
than any of us can comprehend.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.316
-Connor.
-What?

05:16.399 --> 05:17.817
-It's Connor.
-Who is Connor?

05:17.901 --> 05:19.903
-Carter is Connor.
-Oh. Right. Connor.

05:19.986 --> 05:22.280
The grill has a grease trap
that needs to be cleaned

05:22.364 --> 05:24.157
before I return it,
and since I'm gonna do

05:24.240 --> 05:26.576
most of the work today,
I don't think it should be me.

05:26.659 --> 05:27.535
-Not it!
-Not it!

05:27.619 --> 05:28.828
One of you kids is doing it.

05:28.912 --> 05:30.789
I'm not greasing up
these gorgeous hands.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.707
We'll figure something out.
Gene will do it.

05:32.791 --> 05:33.750
-Bless you.
-Whoa!

05:33.833 --> 05:35.168
Pretty windy out here.

05:35.251 --> 05:36.878
It's almost as if God is whispering,

05:36.961 --> 05:39.339
"Three months is not long enough."

05:39.422 --> 05:41.841
-Say it, don't spray it, God.
-Linda, shh. Here they come.

05:41.925 --> 05:43.843
-Nothing!
-Hey, guys! Look at you.

05:43.927 --> 05:44.761
Thank you.

05:44.844 --> 05:47.764
-I just said, "Look at you." I--
-Sorry, I'm nervous.

05:47.847 --> 05:50.058
So, I know you said that
whatever I came up with

05:50.141 --> 05:52.644
for the burger of the day would
be fine, but I hope you like

05:52.727 --> 05:55.730
what I landed on,
The "Ring-Gruyère-er" Burger.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.273
-Like ring bearer.
-Yeah.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.026
It has Gruyère cheese
and an onion ring on it.

06:00.110 --> 06:01.569
Oh, my God, I love it!

06:01.653 --> 06:04.114
And it comes with a side
of Farro salad.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.908
Get it? Like Farrah, but Farro.

06:06.991 --> 06:07.826
-Wow.
-Amazing.

06:07.909 --> 06:09.786
Farro, Farrah. Oh, yeah.

06:09.869 --> 06:11.371
I figured we'd cook here.

06:11.454 --> 06:13.248
I don't want to get
in the way of your crew

06:13.331 --> 06:16.126
-while you're setting up.
-That's not a crew. Those are all guests.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.128
We're having a very
do-it-yourself wedding.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.587
Oh, people love those.

06:19.671 --> 06:23.008
It's DIY, but we have
the important stuff taken care of.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.968
Your burgers
and Farrah's grandma's cake.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.386
Grandma couldn't make the trip,

06:26.469 --> 06:29.597
but she baked her famous red velvet cake
with cream cheese frosting for us.

06:29.681 --> 06:31.516
My cousin drove it from Atlanta.

06:31.599 --> 06:33.309
The lost city of Atlanta?

06:33.393 --> 06:35.562
The cream cheese frosting
needs to be refrigerated.

06:35.645 --> 06:39.315
-Can we put it in one of your coolers?
-I guess we could, yeah,

06:39.399 --> 06:41.067
make some room. Sure.

06:41.151 --> 06:43.862
You're looking
a little shorthanded out there.

06:43.945 --> 06:45.989
You wanna borrow my kids to help set up?

06:46.072 --> 06:48.074
-That'd be great.
-Would it, though?

06:48.158 --> 06:49.284
Go be helpful.

06:49.367 --> 06:52.662
I'll try, but I'm not
so good with this stuff. Whoa!

06:52.746 --> 06:54.831
-Louise!
-Ugh. Fine.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.125
This isn't what we signed up for.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.919
Right? We were just supposed to
hand Dad lettuce and stuff.

07:00.003 --> 07:01.212
Now we're chair monkeys?

07:01.296 --> 07:04.924
It's not so hard. We're just taking chairs
and lining them up in rows. Oh, boy.

07:05.008 --> 07:07.469
I like posing for pictures,

07:07.552 --> 07:08.970
but you're really going to town.

07:09.054 --> 07:12.265
Sorry, everyone loves
kids in wedding pictures.

07:12.349 --> 07:14.225
That's why child weddings
used to be popular.

07:14.309 --> 07:15.435
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

07:15.518 --> 07:17.645
Okay, that ought to do it though,
right? Ha, ha.

07:17.729 --> 07:20.482
There's gotta be some other kids
around here you can photograph.

07:20.565 --> 07:23.985
A flower girl or a tuxedo baby
or something...

07:24.069 --> 07:26.654
Nope! Do you guys want me
to jingle my keys for you?

07:26.738 --> 07:27.822
Are you too old for that?

07:27.906 --> 07:29.574
-Give them a jingle.
-Jingle-jangle.

07:29.657 --> 07:31.576
-Oh! I love it.
-Jingle-jangle.

07:34.162 --> 07:36.039
Wow, this cake is pretty big.

07:36.122 --> 07:38.083
It's a wedding cake. They're big.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.210
That's the one thing they have to be.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.295
I think I can squeeze this in here.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.673
Oh... thank God. It fits.

07:44.756 --> 07:46.132
We're doing everything.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.509
Now we're cooling the cake.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.761
Those dum-dum's didn't think
anything through--

07:49.844 --> 07:51.096
-Hello!
-Hey, you!

07:51.179 --> 07:54.307
Uh, good news. The cake fits
in the cooler, no problem.

07:54.391 --> 07:56.685
-I did it. Linda did nothing.
-Hey.

07:56.768 --> 07:59.312
The ceremony's gonna begin
in a little bit.

07:59.396 --> 08:01.690
Is it possible you guys could join us?
As guests?

08:01.773 --> 08:02.982
It would mean so much to us.

08:03.066 --> 08:04.943
If you can swing it, time-wise.

08:05.026 --> 08:07.404
Oh, uh, yes, we would love to.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.530
Uh, thank you.

08:08.613 --> 08:09.948
Great. See you there.

08:10.031 --> 08:12.409
Wow. Has anyone
ever been a caterer

08:12.492 --> 08:15.286
and a guest at the same wedding?
Are we pioneers?

08:15.370 --> 08:17.706
Huh. No one's ever dreamed that big.

08:17.789 --> 08:19.708
I'm going to pretend
that you're being sincere

08:19.791 --> 08:21.209
and that we're pioneers.

08:22.043 --> 08:23.712
And we're done.

08:23.795 --> 08:25.964
Someone's rows got pretty good
there near the end.

08:26.047 --> 08:28.425
-My rows.
-What are those people doing?

08:28.508 --> 08:30.802
They're putting something
under every seat.

08:30.885 --> 08:31.803
Oprah much?

08:31.886 --> 08:33.346
So, uh, what's in the box?

08:33.430 --> 08:36.808
Don't open those.
It's a surprise for during the wedding.

08:36.891 --> 08:39.686
You had me at
"surprise for during the wedding."

08:39.769 --> 08:40.812
I just said it.

08:40.895 --> 08:43.481
That's where you had me.
You've lost me now.

08:43.565 --> 08:45.567
Oh, no, no, no, the...

08:45.650 --> 08:47.777
the photo of them river rafting.

08:53.658 --> 08:55.076
-Hello?
-Bob, it's Teddy.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.161
Why'd I pick up?

08:56.244 --> 08:58.121
How's the wedding? All set?

08:58.204 --> 08:59.664
Yeah, we had to hurry through prep

08:59.748 --> 09:01.791
because they invited us
to attend the ceremony.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.835
-Wow.
-Which I think is about to start,

09:03.918 --> 09:05.295
-so I gotta--
-Hold on.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.088
I wrote a toast for you. Just in case.

09:07.172 --> 09:09.924
-They might not ask, but...
-I'm not gonna be asked to do a toast.

09:10.008 --> 09:11.676
-...you wanna be ready.
-I'm hanging up.

09:11.760 --> 09:14.429
"As a burger man,
I can tell you every romance

09:14.512 --> 09:17.182
has its share of pickles and beefs."

09:17.265 --> 09:18.600
Uh, did you ge--?

09:18.683 --> 09:20.935
Welcome to Connor
and Farrah's wedding.

09:21.019 --> 09:23.146
Before we begin,
the bride and groom asked

09:23.229 --> 09:25.482
that I thank everyone who chipped in.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.860
Your help is as personal to them
as their childhood blankets,

09:28.943 --> 09:30.653
which adorn the wedding arch.

09:30.737 --> 09:34.282
Farrah called hers Frankie.
"Frankie the Blankie."

09:34.366 --> 09:36.785
We were allowed to bring our blankies?

09:36.868 --> 09:39.788
Now, if you will please rise.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.669
Are you crying already?

09:45.752 --> 09:48.046
This is all because of our food.

09:48.129 --> 09:50.215
They'll be telling
their grandchildren about us.

09:50.298 --> 09:52.133
Ooh, oh, geez, this wind!

09:52.217 --> 09:54.844
When Connor and Farrah asked me to--

09:55.970 --> 09:59.099
--all right, but the only shoes
I have are sandals.

09:59.182 --> 10:02.977
We'll have to wait for my fungal
infection to clear up--

10:04.521 --> 10:05.772
--Sammy Davis, Jr.

10:05.855 --> 10:07.023
-Uh-oh.
-Yeah.

10:07.107 --> 10:10.026
Who would've guessed a piece
of poster board would keep blowing away?

10:10.110 --> 10:12.946
I told you.
This is what happens when you rush.

10:13.029 --> 10:13.988
Oh, my face!

10:15.657 --> 10:17.325
Is that guy flashing the officiant?

10:17.409 --> 10:20.078
No, Tina, he's trying to block
the wind from the microphone.

10:20.161 --> 10:22.580
The bride and groom have a surprise

10:22.664 --> 10:24.916
that they feel symbolizes their love.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.711
-If you'd look under your seats...
-Finally.

10:27.794 --> 10:31.047
I'm going to count to three,
and we'll open our boxes together.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.675
One, two, three.

10:33.758 --> 10:34.801
A dead butterfly?

10:34.884 --> 10:36.261
That's what I got, too.

10:36.344 --> 10:37.429
Mine looks okay.

10:37.512 --> 10:38.680
Oh, no, dead.

10:38.763 --> 10:39.681
Oh, my God.

10:39.764 --> 10:43.309
A beautiful cloud of butterflies
to symbolize--

10:43.393 --> 10:45.687
Oh, uh, anyone get a live one?

10:45.770 --> 10:48.940
Let's see if we can
get them to fly at the same time.

10:49.024 --> 10:52.193
Everyone, just toss your dead butterfly
into the air and they'll look alive.

10:52.277 --> 10:54.696
One, two, three.

10:54.779 --> 10:55.697
Oh, God.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.574
They can swim, right?

10:57.657 --> 11:00.368
Maybe the live ones
can float on the dead ones?

11:00.452 --> 11:03.288
The bride and groom
have written their own vows,

11:03.371 --> 11:05.540
which they will read to one another.

11:06.124 --> 11:09.586
Farrah, the Oxford
English Dictionary define--

11:11.629 --> 11:13.048
I can't hear.

11:13.131 --> 11:14.174
The P.A. cut out.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.009
Frankie!

11:16.092 --> 11:19.763
-Oh, no.
-Looks like Frankie's going to Hollywood.

11:27.062 --> 11:30.190
Okay, that was, uh, well, we all saw it.

11:30.273 --> 11:31.608
It didn't go well.

11:31.691 --> 11:32.567
It was bad.

11:32.650 --> 11:34.361
-Yeah.
-Really bad.

11:34.444 --> 11:35.695
That was the wedding?

11:35.779 --> 11:39.866
Yes. Which is why we have to make
this the best reception ever.

11:39.949 --> 11:41.659
Our food is what brought them together,

11:41.743 --> 11:44.662
now it's the only thing
that can save this day.

11:44.746 --> 11:47.082
Don't put so much pressure on yourself.

11:47.165 --> 11:48.833
Yeah, cut yourself some slack, B-dawg.

11:48.917 --> 11:50.794
The "B" stands for "Bob." That's you.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.837
-Can I not be B-dawg?
-Sleep on it?

11:52.921 --> 11:54.589
We just need to stay focused

11:54.673 --> 11:57.801
-and make sure everything goes perfectly.
-The wind blew out the grill.

11:57.884 --> 12:00.428
-Damn it!
-Bob, calm down.

12:00.512 --> 12:02.305
Let's just move the grill behind the car.

12:02.389 --> 12:03.848
Right, of course.

12:03.932 --> 12:05.266
B-dawg's freaking out.

12:05.350 --> 12:07.227
It seems to be staying lit.

12:07.310 --> 12:08.853
Your mom and I will man the grill,

12:08.937 --> 12:10.647
you form an assembly line with the meat,

12:10.730 --> 12:11.773
Gruyère and onion rings.

12:11.856 --> 12:13.358
I need everyone focused.

12:13.441 --> 12:14.609
What are you doing?

12:14.693 --> 12:16.695
We're onion accessorizing.

12:16.778 --> 12:18.613
-We're fancy.
-You know what? Forget it.

12:18.697 --> 12:20.907
You do something far away from here.

12:20.990 --> 12:24.369
-Your mom and I will take care of this.
-Let's go before they change their minds.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.705

13:36.566 --> 13:38.735
How will we know who gets in the most?
Honor system?

13:38.818 --> 13:42.489
Honor? No. We'll look at his camera
after and count them up.

13:42.572 --> 13:44.282
What are we playing for? Pink slips?

13:44.366 --> 13:46.951
Let's say whoever gets in
the least amount of pictures

13:47.035 --> 13:50.789
is the loser and has to clean
the grease trap on the grill.

13:50.872 --> 13:52.540
Deal. I got this wrapped up.

13:52.624 --> 13:54.834
There's a reason
they call it photo-Gene-ic.

13:54.918 --> 13:59.047

14:15.522 --> 14:17.732
We're missing 20 slices of Gruyère.

14:17.816 --> 14:20.318
If we can't find it, the burger
of the day won't make sense

14:20.402 --> 14:22.529
and dinner will be one more
thing that went wrong.

14:22.612 --> 14:23.822
I can't let this happen.

14:23.905 --> 14:25.365
Take a deep breath, Bob.

14:25.448 --> 14:27.200
The burgers will be delicious either way.

14:27.283 --> 14:29.369
You're not responsible
for anything that happened.

14:29.452 --> 14:31.705
We're responsible
for them getting married.

14:31.788 --> 14:33.456
We're responsible for this.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.042
Just because we brought these two together

14:36.126 --> 14:38.294
doesn't mean it's our fault
that they had a wedding

14:38.378 --> 14:39.254
during a windstorm.

14:39.337 --> 14:40.755
Cheese, where are you?

14:40.839 --> 14:43.049
Their relationship started
with a car accident,

14:43.133 --> 14:44.300
and now it's a train wreck.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.095
-Hi, hello.
-Not helping, Lin.

14:47.178 --> 14:49.806
My point is nothing bad
that's happened today is your fault.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.392
Found it! Oh, God.

14:52.475 --> 14:53.309
Ah!

14:54.769 --> 14:57.313
-No!
-Okay, that one's your fault.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.777
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.

15:02.861 --> 15:05.780
Should we leave? The car's right here.
Should we just leave? We'll go.

15:05.864 --> 15:08.575
-They'll send the kids home.
-I killed it. It's ruined.

15:08.658 --> 15:10.910
This is Grandma's special cake.

15:10.994 --> 15:13.079
The second most important thing
after the burgers.

15:13.163 --> 15:14.205
Probably more important.

15:14.289 --> 15:15.707
-Lin!
-Right.

15:15.790 --> 15:17.250
-We gotta tell them.
-No.

15:17.334 --> 15:18.626
No, no, no.

15:18.710 --> 15:20.337
We have to fix it.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.713
We have to try and reshape it.

15:21.796 --> 15:24.341
If it gets dark enough,
no one will notice.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.092
Oh, who am I kidding?

15:26.176 --> 15:27.719
I've ruined their wedding.

15:27.802 --> 15:29.054
No, Bob, I'll do it.

15:29.137 --> 15:30.847
You cook, and I'll try to reshape it.

15:30.930 --> 15:34.601
I've eaten a lot of cake in my life,
so, hopefully, I can do it from memory.

15:34.684 --> 15:35.518
Oh, it's good.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.145
-Lin. Don't--
-Let me work.

15:37.729 --> 15:40.398
Ah, pretty sure I got this one locked up.

15:40.482 --> 15:42.650
That grease trap
has one of your names on it.

15:42.734 --> 15:45.487
Dream on. I've been in,
like, every picture he's taken.

15:45.570 --> 15:46.988
Except that one.

15:47.072 --> 15:48.490
You want to end it now?

15:48.573 --> 15:49.949
-Should we count them?
-Fine.

15:50.033 --> 15:51.868
I'll call you Rizzo and you Frenchy,

15:51.951 --> 15:53.620
because you're about to be in grease.

15:53.703 --> 15:56.331
Shut your cheese flaps and get
ready to clean that grease trap.

15:56.414 --> 15:58.541
Hey, clicky fingers. Clicky.

15:59.751 --> 16:02.796
You guys almost done?
I should be still taking photos.

16:02.879 --> 16:05.674
-Shh. You're making me lose count.
-Not looking good for you, Gene.

16:05.757 --> 16:07.592
Tina has the most pictures,

16:07.676 --> 16:09.511
and I have one more than you.

16:09.594 --> 16:11.137
I thought the camera loved me.

16:11.221 --> 16:14.849
That's it. We're back to the first picture
that's all of them.

16:14.933 --> 16:15.892
Ha! Gene loses.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.519
Wait, I'm in that picture.

16:17.602 --> 16:18.561
What? Where?

16:18.645 --> 16:20.605
I'm reflected in her sunglasses.

16:20.689 --> 16:23.775
I was trying to get her attention
because I thought she was Helen Mirren.

16:23.858 --> 16:26.986
-Wait, that's not Helen Mirren?
-I'm in there twice.

16:27.070 --> 16:29.197
I don't lose, Louise does.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.657
-No!
-Yes.

16:30.740 --> 16:33.618
I got to call my mom and tell her
I didn't meet Helen Mirren.

16:33.702 --> 16:35.161
I won, as predicted.

16:35.245 --> 16:36.538
I shutted your butts.

16:36.621 --> 16:38.915
Should we go back
and see how much you have to clean?

16:38.998 --> 16:40.750
-You shut your butt.
-You shut your butt.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.836
-No, you shut your butt!
-My butt is shut.

16:42.919 --> 16:45.088
Mine's wide open!

16:46.715 --> 16:49.300
Mmm. Mmm. These burgers are amazing.

16:49.384 --> 16:51.386
Hey, save room
for Farrah's grandma's cake.

16:51.469 --> 16:54.222
-It is going to blow your mind.
-Really?

16:54.305 --> 16:57.308
But cake's cake. You've had one,
you've had them all.

16:57.392 --> 17:00.020
Sometimes, you don't even want
something sweet after a meal.

17:00.103 --> 17:03.023
Am I right?
I mean, it's sometimes too much.

17:03.106 --> 17:06.359
Bob, come on, you're too much.

17:06.443 --> 17:09.279
Let's get to that cake cutting.
Cake, cake, cake!

17:09.362 --> 17:11.448
Cake! Cake! Cake!

17:11.531 --> 17:12.782
Cake! Cake!

17:12.866 --> 17:14.492
I thought you were fixing the cake.

17:14.576 --> 17:17.037
Sorry, you know I can't resist a chant.

17:17.120 --> 17:19.998
-Well, go back and fix it.
-Right, right, right.

17:20.081 --> 17:21.499
-Oh, God.
-Cake, cake...

17:21.583 --> 17:25.670
Uh... Okay!

17:25.754 --> 17:27.547
Here's the cake.

17:27.630 --> 17:29.716
Ooh!

17:29.799 --> 17:32.844
Bring it into the light.
We want to take a picture.

17:32.927 --> 17:34.304
No, I'm good.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.430
Linda, come on.

17:35.513 --> 17:37.182
Okay.

17:37.849 --> 17:40.560
-You're going backwards. Um...
-You'regoing backwards.

17:40.643 --> 17:41.936
Just kidding. Ha.

17:42.020 --> 17:43.646
Here I come.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.066
Oh, dear Lord.

17:46.149 --> 17:47.025
Oh. Oh, no.

17:47.108 --> 17:49.486
What happened to Grandma's cake?

17:49.569 --> 17:50.862
What do you mean?

17:50.945 --> 17:52.697
Um, it's all smushed.

17:52.781 --> 17:54.991
What? No, that's how it looks.

17:55.075 --> 17:59.037
It's, uh-- Grandma made it like that.
You know. She's so old.

18:00.288 --> 18:02.040
This is a joke, right?

18:02.123 --> 18:05.627
I mean, now you'll bring out
the real cake? Ha, ha?

18:05.710 --> 18:08.296
No. Listen, Farrah, Carter...

18:08.380 --> 18:09.547
-Connor.
-Connor.

18:09.631 --> 18:11.049
I'm sorry.

18:11.132 --> 18:12.509
I got myself worked up

18:12.592 --> 18:14.511
trying to make everything
perfect for tonight,

18:14.594 --> 18:17.889
especially after literally
everything went wrong today,

18:17.972 --> 18:21.935
so I was rushing around
and I fell on your cake.

18:22.018 --> 18:24.979
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

18:25.063 --> 18:26.856
Everything did go wrong today.

18:26.940 --> 18:29.234
I keep telling myself it was all okay,

18:29.317 --> 18:32.946
just one thing, here or there,
but it isn't okay.

18:33.029 --> 18:35.448
The wind blew everything everywhere.

18:35.532 --> 18:39.911
I lost my baby blanket
that I was gonna give to my children.

18:40.495 --> 18:42.622
-Poor little baby, The Belcher Children.
-Louise.

18:42.706 --> 18:45.458
And now Grandma's cake is ruined.

18:45.542 --> 18:48.211
Is this just one big omen?

18:48.294 --> 18:50.296
Of course not.

18:50.380 --> 18:52.424
We're gonna be okay.

18:52.507 --> 18:55.135
But what if we aren't?

18:55.802 --> 18:58.763
-Farrah, I'm so glad you brought that up.
-Oh, God.

18:58.847 --> 19:01.016
When you first told me
you were getting married

19:01.099 --> 19:03.852
after three months, I thought you were
bananas in the tailpipe.

19:03.935 --> 19:05.145
I thought it was too short.

19:05.228 --> 19:07.480
You haven't smelled
each other's farts.

19:07.564 --> 19:10.567
You haven't been through enough
bad stuff together.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.986
But today, you really packed it in.

19:13.069 --> 19:15.864
The universe cut a fart
all over your wedding.

19:15.947 --> 19:19.075
Someone clogged up the porta potty,
which is hard.

19:19.159 --> 19:21.494
-Yeah, "someone."
-It was like that when I got there.

19:21.578 --> 19:23.872
Most people would've cracked earlier,

19:23.955 --> 19:25.790
but you let it all roll off your back.

19:25.874 --> 19:28.835
And then my extremely
passionate husband

19:28.918 --> 19:31.296
-fell on your cake and broke you.
-"Broke" is a little--

19:31.379 --> 19:33.840
Looking at you, can I tell you something?

19:33.923 --> 19:36.426
I guarantee you two are gonna make it.

19:36.509 --> 19:37.469
We are?

19:37.552 --> 19:38.887
Yeah. You are.

19:38.970 --> 19:40.972
The way you handled
everything today shows

19:41.056 --> 19:43.183
how all you really care about
is each other.

19:43.266 --> 19:44.309
And you know what else?

19:44.392 --> 19:48.146
The cake doesn't look great,
but I bet it still tastes great.

19:48.229 --> 19:49.814
There's no dirt in it or anything,

19:49.898 --> 19:51.566
just pretend like
you already chewed it!

19:51.649 --> 19:55.236
Mmm. Oh, it's delicious, Grandma.

19:55.320 --> 19:56.821
If you don't look at it, it's fine.

19:56.905 --> 19:58.281
Just like you guys.

19:58.365 --> 20:00.116
Wait, what does that mean?

20:00.200 --> 20:01.409
Oh! No, I mean...

20:01.493 --> 20:03.453
Not that! I didn't mean that.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.455
But you do have mascara
running down your face

20:05.538 --> 20:07.332
like a crazy clown, I'm sorry.

20:07.415 --> 20:09.042
My crazy clown.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.044
Oh, you.

20:11.127 --> 20:12.462
Now, let's try some cake, huh?

20:12.545 --> 20:15.173
Oh! It's really falling apart.

20:15.256 --> 20:16.341
Also, I was wrong.

20:16.424 --> 20:18.885
There is a little dirt in it, and a fork.

20:18.968 --> 20:21.179
I lost that in there
when I was trying to reshape it,

20:21.262 --> 20:22.639
so look out for that. Enjoy.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.224
Who is this woman?

20:24.307 --> 20:26.267
I'm the caterer, ma'am.

20:26.351 --> 20:27.686
The caterer.

20:28.853 --> 20:31.272
Linda, what you said
before was beautiful.

20:31.356 --> 20:33.316
I think you saved the wedding.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.568
No, wesaved the wedding, Bob.

20:35.652 --> 20:36.903
We made this wedding.

20:36.986 --> 20:38.905
Take that, doctors in war zones.

20:38.988 --> 20:41.408
Yeah. I mean, they do good stuff, too.

20:41.491 --> 20:43.535
But not everyone can make burgers.

20:43.618 --> 20:44.869
Hey! It's Frankie!

20:44.953 --> 20:46.788
Talk about a wet blanket.

20:46.871 --> 20:48.039
-Get it?
-Too soon.

20:48.123 --> 20:49.207
-Oh, God.
-What?

20:49.290 --> 20:50.917
There's a dead butterfly in the cake.

20:51.001 --> 20:52.585
Does it taste like butter?

20:52.669 --> 20:54.504
If the answer is no, lie to me.

20:54.587 --> 20:55.505
Oh. It's a leaf.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.340
