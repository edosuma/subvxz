00:01.168 --> 00:02.769
Tonight on "Shark Tank"...

00:02.769 --> 00:04.938
Sharks, it's time to say
Gouda-bye...

00:04.938 --> 00:05.939
No!

00:05.939 --> 00:07.074
...to boring gifts.

00:07.074 --> 00:09.243
My dad left
one more thing for us.

00:09.243 --> 00:10.410
What?
A note.

00:10.410 --> 00:12.379
A message beyond the grave.
What?

00:12.379 --> 00:14.047
All we need is someone
to pour gasoline on the fire.

00:14.047 --> 00:15.716
Wrong move, wrong time.

00:15.716 --> 00:17.985
I am very worried
about competition.

00:17.985 --> 00:21.088
I already know that this
market is $11 billion worldwide.

00:21.088 --> 00:22.155
You guys
are the real deal.

00:22.155 --> 00:23.357
We're just undercapitalized.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.058
We-- We know
what we want to do.

00:25.058 --> 00:25.993
I don't think so.

00:25.993 --> 00:27.427
We've taken it
as far as we can.

00:27.427 --> 00:29.062
We're out of money.

00:29.062 --> 00:31.565
Guys. You've been trying to
get in here for 10 years.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.267
And now
you have an offer.

00:33.267 --> 00:34.234
Don't blow it.

00:42.543 --> 00:43.810
First in the Tank

00:43.810 --> 00:46.980
is an exciting treat
for special occasions.

00:55.923 --> 00:58.292
Hi, Sharks, I'm Rachel.

00:58.292 --> 00:59.359
And I'm Aaron.

00:59.359 --> 01:01.128
We're from West Palm Beach, Florida.

01:01.128 --> 01:04.998
And we're here seeking
$300,000 for 5% of our company.

01:04.998 --> 01:07.568
So, Sharks, we've brought
some gifts for you.

01:07.568 --> 01:10.137
And what we've got
is <i>w</i> cooler

01:10.137 --> 01:12.639
than these outdated
gift baskets

01:12.639 --> 01:14.474
that my granny sends me

01:14.474 --> 01:16.276
out of a mail-order catalog.

01:16.276 --> 01:18.245
And definitely
way tastier

01:18.245 --> 01:20.647
than overpriced fruit
shipped to your door.

01:20.647 --> 01:23.917
Now, the dominant players in
the online edible gifting space,

01:23.917 --> 01:25.285
they're gonna
ship you a basket

01:25.285 --> 01:27.754
full of chunks of cheese
and chubs of meat

01:27.754 --> 01:30.223
that you have to
laboriously peel, chop up,

01:30.223 --> 01:32.593
and then artistically
present yourself.

01:32.593 --> 01:35.362
Sharks, it's time to say
Gouda-bye...

01:35.362 --> 01:36.363
No!

01:36.363 --> 01:37.631
...to boring gifts. Oh.

01:37.631 --> 01:41.034
And revolutionize the edible
online gifting space with...

01:41.034 --> 01:42.135
Boarderie.
Boarderie.

01:42.135 --> 01:44.871
Boarderie is the
first company in the world

01:44.871 --> 01:46.740
shipping completely
pre-assembled

01:46.740 --> 01:50.544
catering-quality cheese and
charcuterie boards nationwide.

01:50.544 --> 01:54.514
Our edible works of art are
shipped completely prearranged.

01:54.514 --> 01:56.383
All you have to do
is remove your board

01:56.383 --> 01:58.518
from its perfectly
sealed packaging,

01:58.518 --> 02:00.520
pour the nuts in the spots
where you find them,

02:00.520 --> 02:03.357
and you have a beautiful
chef-quality display

02:03.357 --> 02:05.425
in just minutes. Wow.

02:05.425 --> 02:07.027
So, Sharks,
who's ready to make

02:07.027 --> 02:09.529
an un-Brie-lievable
investment?

02:09.529 --> 02:10.831
We know
it's a lot of cheese.

02:10.831 --> 02:13.800
But we're gonna make you
a lot of cheddar!

02:13.800 --> 02:15.869
Stop the talking.
Start the eating!

02:15.869 --> 02:18.472
So, Sharks, you have
your "Shark-uterie" boards

02:18.472 --> 02:20.374
in front of you.
Ah. I got it.

02:20.374 --> 02:22.175
Oh, wow.
That's really tasty.

02:22.175 --> 02:23.443
Oh, wow.

02:23.443 --> 02:25.846
So we have a small,
a medium, and a large.

02:25.846 --> 02:27.347
And one thing
to understand about these

02:27.347 --> 02:28.982
is they're not
custom products.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.717
These are made
in an assembly line.

02:30.717 --> 02:33.787
And we can make up to 3,000
of these in any given day.

02:33.787 --> 02:36.423
Wow.
So we've created
a new gifting category.

02:36.423 --> 02:37.991
This is amazing.
Thank you.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.594
When was this board made?

02:40.594 --> 02:42.262
'Cause it tastes super fresh.
So fresh.

02:42.262 --> 02:44.698
It's all super fresh.
Our standard is next-day.

02:44.698 --> 02:47.901
So if somebody makes an order
by midnight, the next day,

02:47.901 --> 02:49.436
we make it
completely fresh

02:49.436 --> 02:51.138
and then it ships out
that same day

02:51.138 --> 02:53.440
and it gets to the customer
the very next day.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.308
Where's the facility
that you're doing this at?

02:55.308 --> 02:58.211
That we have a
15,000-square-foot
production kitchen

02:58.211 --> 02:59.446
in Florida.

02:59.446 --> 03:02.616
So let's talk about price.
What does this cost?

03:02.616 --> 03:05.986
So the one in front of you
costs us $91 to produce.

03:05.986 --> 03:08.055
We wholesale it
to our vendors,

03:08.055 --> 03:12.726
mostly through e-tailers
online for $154,

03:12.726 --> 03:14.895
and it retails for $229,
including shipping.

03:14.895 --> 03:16.730
How did you guys
come up with this?

03:16.730 --> 03:19.866
So I've been in hospitality
and restaurants my entire life,

03:19.866 --> 03:21.601
and while I was in
culinary school,

03:21.601 --> 03:23.503
to make money, I started
a little catering business.

03:23.503 --> 03:25.972
And over the next 15 years,
my wife, Julie, and I

03:25.972 --> 03:27.908
built one of the largest
high-end catering companies

03:27.908 --> 03:29.309
in South Florida.

03:29.309 --> 03:32.079
For royalty, for celebrities,
for athletes. Wow.

03:32.079 --> 03:34.081
It was, like, really
a dream come true.

03:34.081 --> 03:37.884
And then the pandemic hit
and it literally, like, stopped.

03:43.590 --> 03:45.325
Oh.
It, uh...

03:45.325 --> 03:48.795
So i-it stopped everything,
and so we pivoted.

03:48.795 --> 03:50.731
And that's when we bet
on e-commerce.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.299
We hustled
for nine months

03:52.299 --> 03:55.135
and we launched with
a popular online e-tailer

03:55.135 --> 03:56.336
and everything changed.

03:56.336 --> 03:59.773
We went from one online
e-tailer the first year.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.942
Then we launched
with Williams-Sonoma,

04:01.942 --> 04:03.810
and then we launched
with DoorDash.

04:03.810 --> 04:05.412
Last year we did
$1.8 million in sales.

04:05.412 --> 04:06.446
What?
Wow!

04:06.446 --> 04:07.681
And then... Wow.

04:07.681 --> 04:10.484
...we launched with Costco
in Q3 of this year.

04:10.484 --> 04:12.185
What will sales be
this year?

04:12.185 --> 04:13.720
$4 million this year.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.489
Wow.
Will you make money?

04:15.489 --> 04:16.923
Yes, we'll be profitable. Yeah.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.391
We'll do $400,000,
is what we believe.

04:18.391 --> 04:20.427
And you don't sell direct
if I want to buy it from you?

04:20.427 --> 04:22.129
We just launched
our website in July.

04:22.129 --> 04:23.463
And how is that
working out?

04:23.463 --> 04:24.865
It's been going
really well so far.

04:24.865 --> 04:28.135
We did $30,000 in sales
our first month.

04:28.135 --> 04:29.870
What is your customer
acquisition cost?

04:29.870 --> 04:33.106
Between $40 to $60
in our first initial

04:33.106 --> 04:34.374
couple of weeks
of testing.

04:34.374 --> 04:35.442
And that's really
why we're here.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.544
We want to build
that side of it out

04:37.544 --> 04:38.879
because
our biggest frustration

04:38.879 --> 04:40.747
is that we're selling
through e-tailers,

04:40.747 --> 04:42.716
so we don't own any
of our own customer data.

04:42.716 --> 04:45.719
So we get a huge rush
of sales in Q4.
Right. Smart.

04:45.719 --> 04:48.655
And then we can't remarket to
those customers Q1 through Q3. Right.

04:48.655 --> 04:50.924
And we see that there's so
much demand for the product.

04:50.924 --> 04:53.693
Rachel, were you working
in the catering business?

04:53.693 --> 04:54.961
Is that how you guys met?
No.

04:54.961 --> 04:57.497
So, when the pandemic hit
and work went remote,

04:57.497 --> 04:59.699
my fiancÃ© and I decided
to move down to Florida

04:59.699 --> 05:01.334
to quarantine
with my family.

05:01.334 --> 05:02.936
Aaron had started
delivering these boards

05:02.936 --> 05:04.571
for local delivery
in our area.

05:04.571 --> 05:06.740
So you were a customer first?
I was customer, yeah.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.942
And I fell in love
with the concept from ordering.

05:08.942 --> 05:10.310
And Aaron and I
got to know each other,

05:10.310 --> 05:12.379
and we would talk about
this vision he had.

05:12.379 --> 05:15.115
I believed in him
since the minute I met him.

05:15.115 --> 05:16.583
Are you partners 50/50?
We're partners.

05:16.583 --> 05:18.518
We own 75% together,

05:18.518 --> 05:20.287
and we have one
outside partner.
Who's the other 25%?

05:20.287 --> 05:22.789
How much has he
invested so far?
$750,000.

05:22.789 --> 05:25.058
- Wow.
-$750,000?
- Wow.

05:25.058 --> 05:28.361
Yep, and he helped us build
out the entire production facility.

05:28.361 --> 05:31.498
Now, there are five
giant competitors

05:31.498 --> 05:34.100
that sell baskets
and gifted items. Yep.

05:34.100 --> 05:35.902
Couldn't they simply
do this themselves?

05:35.902 --> 05:37.137
Why-- Why--
That's a great question.

05:37.137 --> 05:38.338
Why is this proprietary?
It's a great question.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.207
And when we started,
we were worried about that.

05:40.207 --> 05:43.543
But what we're doing is so
different than pick and
packing. Mm.

05:43.543 --> 05:47.247
Our facility is built-to-suit
for this type of production.

05:47.247 --> 05:48.448
That's kind of
our secret sauce.

05:48.448 --> 05:49.783
And that's our
secret sauce, so, you know.

05:49.783 --> 05:51.484
Of, like, how we're able to do
3,000 of these a day.

05:51.484 --> 05:53.954
How much money did
you guys put in?

05:53.954 --> 05:56.857
My wife and I did a $300,000
home equity line of credit.

05:56.857 --> 06:00.594
We also put in another
$150,000 SBA loan,

06:00.594 --> 06:02.762
and then another
$100,000 line of credit

06:02.762 --> 06:03.964
against
the catering business.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.532
And, Rachel, did you
put money in?

06:05.532 --> 06:08.068
I put in $750,000 for
the build-out of the facility

06:08.068 --> 06:09.135
Wow!
Wait, wait, wait.

06:09.135 --> 06:10.370
How much have you
invested in total?

06:10.370 --> 06:12.305
Around $2 million total.
Oh!

06:12.305 --> 06:13.306
- Wow!
- Wow.

06:13.306 --> 06:14.507
Man, that's commitment.

06:14.507 --> 06:16.743
Yeah. Yeah.
And we can do
$70-million plus

06:16.743 --> 06:18.311
out of this one facility. Yep.

06:18.311 --> 06:21.882
Rachel, I couldn't be more
impressed with the two of you.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.483
Thank you. But...

06:23.483 --> 06:25.418
$300,000 for 5%--

06:25.418 --> 06:28.255
I just don't think
the amount of equity...

06:28.255 --> 06:30.023
We're doing
$4 million this year.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.592
And $8 million next year.
I'm with you 100%,
and I-I just don't like to be

06:32.592 --> 06:35.328
a small minority
shareholder like that.

06:35.328 --> 06:37.597
Now, I'm gonna clear the deck,
make room for the other Sharks.

06:37.597 --> 06:39.099
You can have as much
cheese as you want. Yeah.

06:39.099 --> 06:40.500
I'm out.

06:41.434 --> 06:43.770
So, guys, I think
what you've done
is phenomenal, right?

06:43.770 --> 06:45.238
You deserve a ton of credit,
you pivot,

06:45.238 --> 06:48.041
you showed agility, curiosity
to go into a new space.

06:48.041 --> 06:49.910
I just think
this is replicable.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.145
To Kevin's point,
those big company--

06:52.145 --> 06:53.280
they're not stupid.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.315
They know that it's in
their best interest

06:55.315 --> 06:57.250
to keep you from
building that brand.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.785
I'm not saying
you can't do it,

06:58.785 --> 07:01.321
I just don't think the
economics work for me as an investor.

07:01.321 --> 07:02.989
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

07:02.989 --> 07:04.691
Thank you, Mark.
We understand.
Okay, thanks, Mark.

07:04.691 --> 07:06.493
I know this space inside out.

07:06.493 --> 07:08.695
I am very worried
about competition

07:08.695 --> 07:10.797
because I--
I fought them for years.

07:10.797 --> 07:12.132
They built big businesses,

07:12.132 --> 07:14.301
and they have really
good customer acquisition cost.

07:14.301 --> 07:16.937
So my offer is gonna reflect
the risk I see.

07:16.937 --> 07:20.874
But also I bring to the table
a brand called Chef Wonderful

07:20.874 --> 07:22.742
that's been very successful.

07:22.742 --> 07:25.745
And I think I could get
behind this product for you.

07:25.745 --> 07:27.914
I'll give you the $300,000.

07:27.914 --> 07:30.417
I want 17.5% equity.

07:30.417 --> 07:31.718
Wow.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.554
What do you need
the money for?

07:34.554 --> 07:37.424
We think we're gonna do
$2 million just in December,

07:37.424 --> 07:39.993
and we need all the
available capital we can get

07:39.993 --> 07:41.461
to put into inventory.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.063
And this will help us

07:43.063 --> 07:45.131
to be able to run our
direct-to-consumer strategy.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.967
I have an offer.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.969
I think you're gonna need
a lot more cash.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.937
You probably don't
even need a partner.

07:50.937 --> 07:52.138
You probably need
a good credit line.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.540
But I'll give you both.

07:53.540 --> 07:57.677
I'll give you $300,000 cash
plus $300,000 credit line,

07:57.677 --> 07:59.579
but I'd like 15%
of the business.

07:59.579 --> 08:02.449
Is that undercutting
this guy here?

08:02.449 --> 08:03.750
Yeah. A little. Good.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.251
15%.
Thank you, Barbara.

08:05.251 --> 08:06.753
That's an awesome offer.
Thank you for the offer.

08:06.753 --> 08:08.888
I'm gonna make it
really simple.

08:09.923 --> 08:11.057
Um...

08:21.201 --> 08:23.069
Two Sharks are out.

08:23.069 --> 08:25.305
Rachel and Aaron
have two offers on the table

08:25.305 --> 08:28.475
for their charcuterie board
delivery company, Boarderie.

08:28.475 --> 08:31.611
And Lori might be interested.

08:31.611 --> 08:35.081
I'll give you 300,000
for 13%.

08:35.081 --> 08:36.416
13%?

08:36.416 --> 08:38.084
Lucky number 13.

08:38.084 --> 08:40.320
You have three offers. Yes.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.888
What would you like to do?

08:41.888 --> 08:43.590
Our most important thing
to us

08:43.590 --> 08:46.459
is launching our
direct-to-consumer strategy.

08:46.459 --> 08:49.562
And, so, whoever has the most
expertise in that space--

08:49.562 --> 08:51.097
That's right here.

08:51.097 --> 08:53.867
No, it's not.
No one's done what I've done
direct-to-consumer...

08:53.867 --> 08:55.035
in consumable gifting.
That's not true.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.036
Nobody.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.270
You want
to sell this one day

08:57.270 --> 08:59.105
to Hickory Farms
or somebody else.

08:59.105 --> 09:00.206
That's how this works.

09:00.206 --> 09:01.408
I know how to get there.

09:01.408 --> 09:02.709
These two don't.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.344
Well, I've sold over
2,000 products

09:04.344 --> 09:06.413
over 20 years
direct-to-consumer.

09:06.413 --> 09:08.481
I don't think I agree.
That doesn't count, Lori.

09:08.481 --> 09:10.717
I don't think I agree
with what Kevin's saying.

09:10.717 --> 09:13.486
I've done every product
category there is.

09:13.486 --> 09:16.189
Guys, pick-- pick a Shark,
pick an offer.
You gotta pick a Shark.

09:16.189 --> 09:17.924
- Okay. Okay.
- Or counter.

09:21.561 --> 09:22.962
Okay, you say it. Okay.

09:22.962 --> 09:24.531
Okay.
She's gonna say it
'cause I am--

09:24.531 --> 09:25.598
As you can see,
I'm sensitive

09:25.598 --> 09:27.133
and I hate to hurt
people's feelings.

09:27.133 --> 09:29.636
Aww.

09:29.636 --> 09:30.770
Okay.

09:30.770 --> 09:32.405
Lori,
would you do it for 8%?

09:33.606 --> 09:35.141
Oh, you guys.

09:35.141 --> 09:37.310
We've already invested
so much in this.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.312
We've got the whole
production process down.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.948
All we need is someone
to pour gasoline on the fire.

09:41.948 --> 09:43.683
Well, let me tell you this.

09:43.683 --> 09:46.119
And Mark says this all the time.

09:46.119 --> 09:47.454
Say it, Mark.

09:47.454 --> 09:50.457
40% of a watermelon
is better than 100% of a grape.

09:50.457 --> 09:52.358
You know?
So here's the thing.

09:52.358 --> 09:55.562
If I blow you up and
you're making fantastic sales,

09:55.562 --> 09:57.363
then you're going to be
thanking me and saying,

09:57.363 --> 09:59.933
"Oh, I don't care about
those of your points."

09:59.933 --> 10:02.535
So I'm gonna stay at 13%,
you guys.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.605
It's time to decide.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.706
Would you do it
at 10%?

10:06.706 --> 10:08.741
You-- We don't need a lot.
I mean--

10:08.741 --> 10:11.444
I will do it at 12%.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.513
You know what, guys?
I would do it at 10%.

10:16.015 --> 10:17.450
Wow.
I would do it at 10%

10:17.450 --> 10:19.719
because the best deals
we've all ever done

10:19.719 --> 10:21.554
are the least needy entrepreneurs.

10:21.554 --> 10:22.856
Where they just call
with questions...
O'Leary: Yeah.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.591
Mm.
...and they just want
the support

10:24.591 --> 10:26.126
maybe an introduction,
a line of credit...
Look at me.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.193
I'll do it for 9%.

10:27.193 --> 10:28.795
He just did that
to get me down.

10:28.795 --> 10:32.465
He's such a-- Ugh!

10:33.233 --> 10:35.502
9%?

10:35.502 --> 10:36.803
9%.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.104
You got a deal!
You got a deal!

10:38.104 --> 10:39.539
I get free boards now.

10:39.539 --> 10:41.141
I get free boards forever.
I'm going to
kill you, Mark.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.476
Oh!

10:43.476 --> 10:45.411
Spread the cheese!
Spread the cheese!

10:45.411 --> 10:48.014
You're welcome, guys.
Great job, guys.
Thank you.

10:48.014 --> 10:50.283
Cheese for life.
For life!

10:50.283 --> 10:51.684
This is so cool!
That was amazing!

10:51.684 --> 10:52.685
Yeah!

10:52.685 --> 10:53.786
We love Lori.

10:53.786 --> 10:55.455
We think she's
the perfect partner for us.

10:55.455 --> 10:57.624
She reaches
all of our customers,

10:57.624 --> 10:59.926
and she was really passionate
about the product.

10:59.926 --> 11:01.494
And I think that's
what matters most.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.596
We need somebody who's gonna
help us spread the cheese,

11:03.596 --> 11:05.465
and she's
the perfect partner.

11:05.465 --> 11:07.433
Mark!

11:07.433 --> 11:09.202
You did it for that reason.
I know it!
'Cause I knew they weren't
gonna do 13%.

11:09.202 --> 11:10.637
I'm a sucker!
I knew there was no way
they were gonna do 13%.

11:10.637 --> 11:12.372
Lori, don't
complain. I loved your whole speech,

11:12.372 --> 11:14.407
how you were staying at 13%,
and then you went to 9%.

11:14.407 --> 11:16.910
'Cause of--

11:18.811 --> 11:20.146
In Season 13,

11:20.146 --> 11:23.183
we watched Mika Bertholdo
make a deal with Emma Grede

11:23.183 --> 11:26.085
for her one-of-a-kind
headband company, Ooakshell.

11:26.085 --> 11:28.288
We're gonna actually
try to build a proper company.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.223
It's $150,000 for 20%.

11:30.223 --> 11:32.292
Let's see
what she's up to now.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.027
Before "Shark Tank,"

11:34.027 --> 11:37.263
I was living with my husband
and my two kids with my mother,

11:37.263 --> 11:40.033
and we were running
all operations from her house.

11:40.033 --> 11:43.870
I was doing all of the
sourcing, sewing, dyeing, packaging,

11:43.870 --> 11:46.806
marketing 20 hours a day,
7 days a week.

11:46.806 --> 11:49.442
Since "Shark Tank,"
I moved out of my mom's house

11:49.442 --> 11:51.277
into a beautiful new home.

11:51.277 --> 11:53.346
I have a full-time
manufacturer in Dallas,

11:53.346 --> 11:55.215
that does all of my sewing
for me.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.883
And I upgraded from
my mom's garage

11:56.883 --> 11:59.953
into a 1,500-square-foot
warehouse and office.

11:59.953 --> 12:02.121
And I even have an assistant.

12:02.121 --> 12:04.691
She does 90% of all
the packaging.

12:04.691 --> 12:09.662
Since "Shark Tank," Ooakshell
has made $375,000 in sales.

12:09.662 --> 12:11.564
You can double
the amount of inventory

12:11.564 --> 12:12.665
that you're putting out
in the world

12:12.665 --> 12:14.267
if you just get
a little bit of help,

12:14.267 --> 12:16.536
especially when it comes
to production.

12:16.536 --> 12:20.006
Emma has been as hands on
as any Shark could be.

12:20.006 --> 12:23.042
I had a crash course at her
Good American headquarters

12:23.042 --> 12:26.145
in finance, marketing,
fashion merchandising...

12:26.145 --> 12:28.047
This little hit
with the branding,

12:28.047 --> 12:29.515
that makes
a big difference.

12:29.515 --> 12:33.319
I learned more than I have
in all my four years at college.

12:33.319 --> 12:34.687
I'm so, so excited.

12:34.687 --> 12:37.023
This is just
the beginning.
I know!

12:37.023 --> 12:39.192
As a first generation American,

12:39.192 --> 12:41.761
it was really hard to feel
like I was disappointing my parents

12:41.761 --> 12:44.397
when I wasn't following
their dreams to become a doctor.

12:44.397 --> 12:49.269
So, when my mom first told me
she was proud of me, um...

12:49.269 --> 12:51.304
it was amazing.

12:51.304 --> 12:54.474
Kind of made it seem like this
is a business, this is real,

12:54.474 --> 12:56.309
and this is success.

12:57.310 --> 13:00.146
Being on "Shark Tank"
has changed my life.

13:00.146 --> 13:02.548
I get to spend time
with my family and my kids.

13:02.548 --> 13:04.751
And I have an amazing mentor
who's there for me

13:04.751 --> 13:07.620
any time I need and it's
really helped Ooakshell.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.056
And is going to continue
to help Ooakshell grow.

13:22.835 --> 13:24.537
Next into the Tank

13:24.537 --> 13:28.308
is a modern version
of a stale car accessory.

13:34.947 --> 13:36.883
Hey, Sharks,
I'm Trey Brown.

13:36.883 --> 13:38.051
And I'm Don Brown.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.452
We're two brothers
from Los Angeles

13:39.452 --> 13:41.287
seeking
a $200,000 investment

13:41.287 --> 13:43.122
for 5% of our company.

13:43.122 --> 13:45.191
Wow.
Imagine a peaceful day
on the road.

13:45.191 --> 13:47.193
Wind blowing,
sun shining.

13:47.193 --> 13:48.628
You're bumpin'
your favorite track,

13:48.628 --> 13:51.431
cruising down the back
streets, just catching a vibe.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.533
But then that smell
hits you.
Oof!

13:53.533 --> 13:54.867
A nearby landfill.

13:54.867 --> 13:56.069
Spilled coffee.

13:56.069 --> 13:58.971
Even forgotten French fries
can turn your car

13:58.971 --> 14:02.775
from an oasis into a horrible,
stinky nightmare.

14:02.775 --> 14:05.078
For years, the problem
of a stinky ride

14:05.078 --> 14:07.480
has been solved
by a series of ugly

14:07.480 --> 14:09.482
and un-stylish
air fresheners.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.384
So we created Ride FRSH,

14:11.384 --> 14:13.753
the world's flyest
air freshener brand.

14:13.753 --> 14:14.987
I know you guys
are probably wondering

14:14.987 --> 14:16.889
"Why paper air freshener?"

14:16.889 --> 14:18.658
When you do a little
"sniffing around,"

14:18.658 --> 14:20.727
you'll figure out that
it's an untapped market.

14:20.727 --> 14:21.961
At Ride FRSH,

14:21.961 --> 14:24.731
we offer a subscription-based
car air-freshener brand

14:24.731 --> 14:26.666
with unique scents
and designs

14:26.666 --> 14:29.235
that will be sure
to blow you...
And your customer's...

14:29.235 --> 14:30.336
...minds!
...minds!

14:30.336 --> 14:32.372
We have amazing scents
like Woodgrain.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.140
Wow!

14:34.140 --> 14:37.076
Eucalyptus.
I love this one, bro. Nice.

14:37.076 --> 14:39.746
And even your favorite
basketball teams.

14:39.746 --> 14:42.048
This one
smells like winning.

14:42.048 --> 14:43.182
Sorry, Mark.

14:45.151 --> 14:47.453
The reality is,
is that paper air fresheners

14:47.453 --> 14:50.323
have had no innovation
in far too long.

14:50.323 --> 14:52.225
And they smell whack.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.426
Hey, bro.
What's up?

14:53.426 --> 14:55.695
I think I'm smelling a deal.

14:55.695 --> 14:58.765
With the help of the Sharks,
we can make Ride FRSH...

14:58.765 --> 15:00.800
...explode!
Ahh!

15:00.800 --> 15:01.968
- Whoa!
- Wow!

15:01.968 --> 15:03.903
God!

15:03.903 --> 15:05.872
So, Sharks,
in front of you you'll find...
Calm down. Calm down.

15:05.872 --> 15:07.306
...a series of our
Ride FRSH scents.

15:07.306 --> 15:09.642
Please feel free to crack
them open and enjoy.

15:09.642 --> 15:12.512
Wow.
After that?

15:12.512 --> 15:13.780
We can't even function.

15:13.780 --> 15:16.315
Mark, are you okay?
You're kind of still over there.

15:16.315 --> 15:19.051
Ooh, you know what's-- you know what's--
Dumbest marketing move ever.

15:19.051 --> 15:20.219
I'm out.

15:21.988 --> 15:23.423
- What?
- That's it?
- Seriously.

15:23.423 --> 15:24.590
That's mean. Seriously.

15:24.590 --> 15:25.925
You gotta read your room.

15:27.527 --> 15:28.828
Wrong move, wrong time.

15:28.828 --> 15:29.996
What are you upset about?
Yeah. Why?

15:29.996 --> 15:31.197
Yeah.
Why do you think?

15:31.197 --> 15:32.765
The one air freshener
from the NBA

15:32.765 --> 15:35.168
is the team that beats us
in the NBA conference finals.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.069
Gotta know that
that could backfire.
Oh, Mark.

15:37.069 --> 15:38.771
You're a bigger man than that.
Cut it out.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.173
Yeah, I could be,
but I'm not.

15:40.173 --> 15:41.207
Wow.

15:43.209 --> 15:44.644
Here's one thing
I'll shout out.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.179
Before
I even opened them,

15:46.179 --> 15:48.448
I picked them up
and I could smell the scents.

15:48.448 --> 15:49.882
I was like, wow.

15:49.882 --> 15:53.052
These are obviously packed
with the fragrance.

15:53.052 --> 15:54.287
So we pride ourselves
on having

15:54.287 --> 15:56.556
some traditional scents,
some nontraditional scents.

15:56.556 --> 15:59.258
But our entire approach
and our entire brand

15:59.258 --> 16:01.561
is adding a cool factor
to the air freshener

16:01.561 --> 16:02.962
and changing
the experience.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.730
Do you sell any of this stuff
in retail,

16:04.730 --> 16:07.266
or is it all subscription
direct-to-consumer online?

16:07.266 --> 16:10.970
So we built our business off
of direct-to-consumer online.

16:10.970 --> 16:14.574
We proved the concept
to the tune of over
$1.1 million in sales.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.275
And then...
- What?
- What?

16:16.275 --> 16:18.511
Yep. Thank you.
Thank you.
$1.1 million sales
in how much time?

16:18.511 --> 16:20.413
What period of time
did you do that?

16:20.413 --> 16:21.948
- In three years.
- Three years.
- Wow.

16:21.948 --> 16:23.449
O'Leary: Let's talk about
one year, this year.

16:23.449 --> 16:25.318
What are you gonna do
in this year in sales?

16:25.318 --> 16:27.787
This year, we're gonna
do over $750,000.

16:27.787 --> 16:29.322
Good for you.
But to answer your
original question,

16:29.322 --> 16:30.456
Mr. Wonderful,

16:30.456 --> 16:32.792
we've always known
that the subscription

16:32.792 --> 16:34.994
was the first phase
of our building our business,

16:34.994 --> 16:37.363
but the main potential
and the biggest potential for us

16:37.363 --> 16:39.165
is in retail
and wholesale, right?

16:39.165 --> 16:41.100
Would you say that?
Have you proven that?

16:41.100 --> 16:42.902
Or have you just
started down that alleyway?

16:42.902 --> 16:45.037
Well, gas stations,
things like that,

16:45.037 --> 16:47.039
things where it's intuitive
to pick this up.

16:47.039 --> 16:49.509
Exactly. So just in
the last six months,

16:49.509 --> 16:52.712
we've been able to get to
the final stages of an agreement

16:52.712 --> 16:54.981
with the largest automotive
retailer in the country.

16:54.981 --> 16:56.616
What's the deal for?

16:56.616 --> 16:58.017
2,000 stores.
2,000 locations.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.685
2,000 of their
6,000 locations.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.687
In other words,
they're gonna order from you

17:01.687 --> 17:03.456
how many dollars
of merchandise?

17:03.456 --> 17:04.524
$2.1 million.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.092
Wow.
In 2023.

17:06.092 --> 17:08.594
So it's like Pep Boys,
that kind of thing?
Yeah, it's AutoZone.

17:08.594 --> 17:10.263
What did you sell
last year?

17:10.263 --> 17:13.833
Last year,
we sold $540,000.

17:13.833 --> 17:16.369
And out of that $540,000,
was any retail,

17:16.369 --> 17:17.670
or was it all
subscription-based?

17:17.670 --> 17:19.071
All subscription.
All subscription.

17:19.071 --> 17:23.109
Why does somebody buy
a subscription model... Right.

17:23.109 --> 17:25.077
...for an air freshener
for their car?

17:25.077 --> 17:27.013
Right. Yeah. So it's
the convenience factor, right?

17:27.013 --> 17:28.748
Think rideshare drivers,

17:28.748 --> 17:31.183
taxi drivers,
these types of individuals.

17:31.183 --> 17:34.587
If I started with you,
how long before I cancel?

17:34.587 --> 17:35.721
About four months.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.123
And how much
is a subscription?

17:37.123 --> 17:38.157
They range.

17:38.157 --> 17:40.393
So the base one
is you get two a month

17:40.393 --> 17:42.128
and we have them in pairs,

17:42.128 --> 17:44.163
and that's $8.25
with shipping.

17:44.163 --> 17:45.998
And then the highest one--
Per month?

17:45.998 --> 17:47.767
Yeah. And the highest one
is $10.99.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.102
So 38 cents
is our cost landed.

17:50.102 --> 17:53.239
Out of the $540,000
you did last year...
Mm-hmm.

17:53.239 --> 17:54.774
...were you profitable?

17:54.774 --> 17:56.375
Yes.
Yes.
What did you make?

17:56.375 --> 17:58.778
$40,000 in profit.

17:58.778 --> 18:00.446
Wow.
$40,000.

18:00.446 --> 18:02.381
What were you guys
doing before this?

18:02.381 --> 18:03.683
What got you here?

18:03.683 --> 18:05.084
We're-- We're brothers.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.219
We're lifelong entrepreneurs.

18:07.219 --> 18:10.089
In 2014, we actually launched
the first mobile app

18:10.089 --> 18:11.791
for black and brown emojis

18:11.791 --> 18:14.026
before they kind of
diversified the set.

18:14.026 --> 18:16.662
My brother has
a successful career in sales,

18:16.662 --> 18:20.266
and I was at a couple
different ad agencies in my career.

18:20.266 --> 18:21.834
We both went
to Howard University,

18:21.834 --> 18:23.202
<i>the</i> Howard University. Yep.

18:23.202 --> 18:24.870
I then came
to Los Angeles

18:24.870 --> 18:26.706
and then I got my masters
at USC

18:26.706 --> 18:28.841
in Entrepreneurship Innovation,

18:28.841 --> 18:32.178
and as well as certified
in technology commercialization.

18:32.178 --> 18:33.913
I remember walking down
the street

18:33.913 --> 18:35.848
and seeing all these
air fresheners everywhere

18:35.848 --> 18:38.384
in everybody's car,
and I was like, well, listen,

18:38.384 --> 18:41.454
if we put some culture
and style on top of this thing,

18:41.454 --> 18:44.590
I already know that this
market is $11 billion worldwide

18:44.590 --> 18:46.726
and in the United States,
it's $300 million.

18:46.726 --> 18:48.995
So yeah,
we could definitely do this

18:48.995 --> 18:51.430
because there's nobody really
doing a subscription model.

18:51.430 --> 18:54.900
That's the most interesting
thing you've said in this pitch.

18:54.900 --> 18:58.604
The air freshener market
is $300 million?
Yeah, that's interesting.

18:58.604 --> 19:00.406
In-- In the United States.
Listen, I know
a lot about fragrance.

19:00.406 --> 19:04.176
This is very male-skewed.

19:04.176 --> 19:06.445
I think you need
work here in that

19:06.445 --> 19:09.215
I think you need to have
an entire female-based line

19:09.215 --> 19:11.751
'cause I-I wouldn't
hang this shape in my car.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.519
It's not the right
investment for me,

19:13.519 --> 19:14.854
but I wish you good luck.
Thank you.

19:14.854 --> 19:16.822
Thank you so much.
I'm out.

19:16.822 --> 19:18.891
You guys
are the real deal.

19:18.891 --> 19:23.362
I've been trying to get my
head around investing in you.

19:23.362 --> 19:25.765
When I was younger,
my mom and dad put me

19:25.765 --> 19:27.299
in the back of a car

19:27.299 --> 19:30.136
with a million suitcases
and everything.

19:30.136 --> 19:32.405
I had to sit in the back
for 24 hours.

19:32.405 --> 19:35.641
No big deal.
You were a little kid.
'Cause my dad refused
to pay for a motel,

19:35.641 --> 19:39.545
so we had to drive from
Toronto all the way to Florida.

19:39.545 --> 19:42.348
All I could see was
the air freshener.

19:44.216 --> 19:48.087
It is scorched
into my brain.

19:48.087 --> 19:51.190
As soon as I see air
fresheners, I think,

19:51.190 --> 19:54.193
Aah! I never want
to go back there.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.828
I'm sorry. I can't be in.
I'm out.

19:55.828 --> 19:57.096
Fair enough.
Fair enough. Thank you.

19:57.096 --> 19:58.230
O'Leary: But let me tell you
where I'm stuck at.

19:58.230 --> 19:59.532
The numbers, okay?

19:59.532 --> 20:01.367
No one's brought this up yet
and I don't know why.

20:01.367 --> 20:04.403
$200,000 for 5%...
Yeah.

20:04.403 --> 20:06.706
...imputes a $4 million
valuation on a business

20:06.706 --> 20:08.174
that makes no money.

20:08.174 --> 20:11.010
Yeah.
This is a business model
not yet fine-tuned.

20:11.010 --> 20:12.244
I'm out.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.481
Thank you, Mr. Wonderful.
You know, uh...

20:15.481 --> 20:17.049
I think you need
to be congratulated

20:17.049 --> 20:19.552
for producing
$700,000 in sales.

20:19.552 --> 20:20.886
It's amazing. Online.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.555
Amazing.
Why you're pivoting,

20:22.555 --> 20:24.924
that you're going into retail-- I think you're out of your mind.

20:24.924 --> 20:28.861
I don't think you realize
how cash intensive it is.

20:28.861 --> 20:30.763
Why did you pivot to retail?
I'm curious.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.565
Because that was-- that was
always the plan, right?

20:32.565 --> 20:34.066
And in the last year,
the main way

20:34.066 --> 20:35.735
that we were able
to grow the subscriptions

20:35.735 --> 20:38.237
and acquire those subscribers
became a lot more expensive.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.439
You were losing hard on
your subscription model

20:40.439 --> 20:42.208
because the numbers
had changed.

20:42.208 --> 20:44.009
Yes, but we were
always gonna focus

20:44.009 --> 20:45.611
on growing the business
through retail and wholesale.

20:45.611 --> 20:47.646
All right. So I'm going to
make you an offer

20:47.646 --> 20:49.115
contingent
on your big deals.

20:49.115 --> 20:51.050
Okay.
Okay,
I'll take a flier on this

20:51.050 --> 20:52.651
because I believe
in the two of you.

20:52.651 --> 20:56.155
So, I'll make you the offer
of, of course, the $200,000,

20:56.155 --> 20:58.157
but I do want 25%
of the business.

21:00.292 --> 21:03.229
Whoa. That smells a lot.

21:03.229 --> 21:04.530
Let me--
Can I ask you a question?

21:04.530 --> 21:05.898
Yes. Of course.

21:05.898 --> 21:07.633
Are there other ways
that you can help us

21:07.633 --> 21:09.902
in terms of
a strategic partnership

21:09.902 --> 21:14.573
in exchange for maybe 15%
for the 200K?

21:14.573 --> 21:17.209
I would have to say 15%--
definitely not.

21:17.209 --> 21:19.578
I think this is gonna be
a lot of work to sell this.

21:19.578 --> 21:20.880
200K for 20%?

21:20.880 --> 21:22.982
What?
For 20%?

21:22.982 --> 21:24.150
Contingent on
those two big deals?

21:24.150 --> 21:25.518
Contingent on those
two deals.
Mm-hmm.

21:25.518 --> 21:27.286
You got it.
Okay. Cool.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.687
Thank you.
Thank you.

21:28.687 --> 21:30.256
Good one, guys.

21:30.256 --> 21:31.490
Thank you.
Thank you, guys.

21:31.490 --> 21:33.492
Thank you, Sharks.
You better not
lose my money.

21:35.461 --> 21:36.929
Thank you so much.
My pleasure, really.
Thank you.

21:36.929 --> 21:38.497
Bye-bye.
Thank you, Barbara.

21:38.497 --> 21:39.598
Terrific.
You did a great job.
We appreciate it.
Thank you.

21:39.598 --> 21:41.367
And sorry, again.
We-- Sorry.

21:41.367 --> 21:42.401
It's all good.
It's all good.

21:42.401 --> 21:44.436
Congrats, guys.
Nice job!

21:44.436 --> 21:46.372
I think Barbara saw
a true entrepreneur's

21:46.372 --> 21:48.240
grit, grind, tenacity.

21:48.240 --> 21:50.276
We're already
trending upwards

21:50.276 --> 21:52.645
with these major retail
and wholesale deals

21:52.645 --> 21:53.946
that Trey's been able
to secure.

21:53.946 --> 21:55.781
And having Barbara on board
just means that

21:55.781 --> 21:58.050
we're gonna have more
resources and more abilities

21:58.050 --> 22:00.619
to scale this business
all the way to the top.

22:10.296 --> 22:11.864
Next up is a product

22:11.864 --> 22:14.533
designed to light up
action sports.

22:24.944 --> 22:26.612
Hey, Sharks
I'm Dakota Porter.

22:26.612 --> 22:27.980
And I'm Garret Porter.

22:27.980 --> 22:29.748
We're from Traverse City, Michigan.

22:29.748 --> 22:32.151
And today we're
seeking $200,000

22:32.151 --> 22:36.288
in exchange for 15% equity
of our company Action Glow.

22:36.288 --> 22:38.390
Now, we're
action sport junkies,

22:38.390 --> 22:40.993
and we've been snowboarding
since before we could even walk.

22:40.993 --> 22:44.230
As teenagers, we practically
lived out on the slopes.

22:44.230 --> 22:47.199
And because the sun always set
so early in the winter,

22:47.199 --> 22:49.468
a lot of our snowboarding
was typically done at night.

22:49.468 --> 22:51.437
And sure, they've got
big spotlights,

22:51.437 --> 22:52.838
but when
that sun goes down

22:52.838 --> 22:54.907
the atmosphere becomes miserably...

22:54.907 --> 22:56.308
Boring.
Boring.

22:56.308 --> 22:58.510
But one night we decided
to change it

22:58.510 --> 23:00.813
and created Action Glow.

23:00.813 --> 23:03.449
Action Glow is an aftermarket
LED lighting system

23:03.449 --> 23:04.783
for sporting equipment.

23:04.783 --> 23:07.186
It allows riders to express
their personal style

23:07.186 --> 23:09.288
while also adding
an element of safety.

23:09.288 --> 23:12.491
Over the last few years,
professional athletes

23:12.491 --> 23:14.960
and action sport
enthusiasts worldwide

23:14.960 --> 23:16.829
have been turning
to Action Glow

23:16.829 --> 23:18.364
for their night riding adventures.

23:18.364 --> 23:21.000
We currently offer
eight different applications,

23:21.000 --> 23:22.902
ranging from snowboards
to surfboards.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.136
And the best part is,

23:24.136 --> 23:26.939
our systems can be applied
in just 5 minutes

23:26.939 --> 23:28.774
to any brand
of sporting equipment.

23:28.774 --> 23:31.777
We are excited to bring
a product into the Tank

23:31.777 --> 23:34.246
that shines brighter than
Mr. Wonderful head.

23:36.382 --> 23:37.416
Bam!

23:37.416 --> 23:39.118
Sharks,
we've been dreaming

23:39.118 --> 23:42.187
of pitching to you guys
since we were kids.

23:42.187 --> 23:43.455
Take a look.

23:43.455 --> 23:44.690
<i>Hi,
we're the Porter brothers,</i>

23:44.690 --> 23:45.925
<i>and we live in
Traverse City, Michigan.</i>

23:45.925 --> 23:47.626
<i>I'm Dakota Porter,
aged 16.</i>

23:47.626 --> 23:49.561
<i>And I'm Garret Porter,
aged 13.</i>

23:49.561 --> 23:50.696
<i>Together, we created
a business,</i>

23:50.696 --> 23:51.931
<i>45th Parallel Lighting,</i>

23:51.931 --> 23:53.165
<i>in which we have
a patent pending</i>

23:53.165 --> 23:54.733
<i>for our product Action Glow.</i>

23:54.733 --> 23:56.201
<i>Dakota Porter,
aged 18.</i>

23:56.201 --> 23:58.337
<i>And I'm Garret Porter,
aged 15.</i>

23:58.337 --> 23:59.638
<i>We need the Sharks help...</i>

23:59.638 --> 24:02.074
<i>To light up
your score.</i>

24:02.074 --> 24:04.977
Oh, my God,
that is the best video!
Thank you, guys.
Thank you.

24:04.977 --> 24:07.846
So you guys applied
all those years?

24:07.846 --> 24:09.415
We grew up
watching the show.

24:09.415 --> 24:11.784
And now, yeah.
Season 14, here we are.

24:11.784 --> 24:13.285
Wow.
Good job. Wow.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.187
You haven't had your business
that long, though, have you?

24:15.187 --> 24:17.656
So we filed for our LLC
in 2012.

24:17.656 --> 24:20.125
So we actually just celebrated
10 years in business this year.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.660
Wow.
You've been in business
for 10 years?

24:21.660 --> 24:22.828
10 years.
That's crazy.

24:22.828 --> 24:25.764
In 2016, our full
utility patent was issued

24:25.764 --> 24:27.533
for decorative
lighting systems...
Oh, really?

24:27.533 --> 24:28.801
...for sporting equipment.

24:28.801 --> 24:31.337
Is it one color,
or can I change colors?

24:31.337 --> 24:34.206
So right now, um, our systems
are one color,

24:34.206 --> 24:35.507
so there's static colors.

24:35.507 --> 24:37.276
And that's kind of why
we're here today.

24:37.276 --> 24:40.012
So we have developed
a second generation product

24:40.012 --> 24:41.313
called Action Glow2.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.248
Right now we're sitting
at 40 SKUs.

24:43.248 --> 24:45.884
And so that drops it
from 40 to 8.

24:45.884 --> 24:48.988
What is the cost go up to get
the multi-LED color?

24:48.988 --> 24:50.990
Yeah, so the cost
will only go up a little bit.

24:50.990 --> 24:53.225
So our current-- the current
price for our product

24:53.225 --> 24:56.128
ranges from $49
for, like, the skateboard

24:56.128 --> 24:59.765
to $124 for an SUP board
or a kayak,

24:59.765 --> 25:01.700
which is obviously
a little bit bigger.

25:01.700 --> 25:03.836
What does it costs you?
$49 to sell--

25:03.836 --> 25:05.838
What does it cost you
to make that?
$15.

25:05.838 --> 25:07.039
Talk-- Talk about
your total sales?

25:07.039 --> 25:10.175
Lifetime sales
are $130,000

25:10.175 --> 25:12.277
of hand-assembled
Action Glow units,

25:12.277 --> 25:16.148
and almost half of that has
come in the last two years alone

25:16.148 --> 25:18.217
when Dakota and I
have graduated college

25:18.217 --> 25:21.387
and we had more time to focus
on selling our product.

25:21.387 --> 25:23.222
You were saying what your
sales were the last two years alone.

25:23.222 --> 25:24.323
What were they?

25:24.323 --> 25:29.361
Yeah, so, in 2021
we did $32,000 in sales

25:29.361 --> 25:31.463
and this year
we're at $22,000,

25:31.463 --> 25:33.532
but we haven't hit
our biggest quarter yet.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.267
And our biggest quarter
was obviously Q4

25:35.267 --> 25:36.335
for the holiday season.

25:36.335 --> 25:38.637
We expect about
40% to 50% of our sales

25:38.637 --> 25:40.372
to come in Q4 alone.

25:40.372 --> 25:41.807
How are you selling it?

25:41.807 --> 25:43.442
Yeah, Right now it's all
word-of-mouth.

25:43.442 --> 25:45.277
We've done no marketing.

25:45.277 --> 25:47.079
None?
No social media
for guys like you?

25:47.079 --> 25:48.180
Yeah, why not?

25:48.180 --> 25:49.448
So,
social media, yeah.

25:49.448 --> 25:51.083
So we've-- we've had
social media accounts.

25:51.083 --> 25:53.385
They're saying you haven't
spent any money on marketing,

25:53.385 --> 25:54.686
only social media driving
word-of-mouth.

25:54.686 --> 25:56.255
We're getting
the orders right now

25:56.255 --> 25:57.623
that Dakota and I
can keep up with.

25:57.623 --> 25:59.224
Because every time
we get an order,

25:59.224 --> 26:01.527
we have to go make it,
literally assemble it,

26:01.527 --> 26:02.795
package it up,
and ship it out.

26:02.795 --> 26:03.929
So we're extremely worried

26:03.929 --> 26:06.665
if we have a TikTok video
go viral, or...

26:06.665 --> 26:07.666
You can't keep up with it.

26:07.666 --> 26:08.867
We won't be able
to keep up.

26:08.867 --> 26:11.003
I've never met anyone
who doesn't want a TikTok

26:11.003 --> 26:12.337
to go viral who's in business. Yeah.

26:12.337 --> 26:13.705
I think you're crazy.

26:13.705 --> 26:15.441
Guys, I-I've been
in this market before

26:15.441 --> 26:17.276
with a product called Illumibowl.

26:17.276 --> 26:21.313
It was five or six years ago,
and it was wildly successful.

26:21.313 --> 26:24.183
And the bigger it got,
the more knockoffs came out.

26:24.183 --> 26:26.919
But we kept-- kept
innovating, kept innovating, innovating,

26:26.919 --> 26:28.554
and knockoffs,
knockoffs, knockoffs--

26:28.554 --> 26:30.589
nothing proprietary here.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.191
I mean, maybe you think
this patent's--
Yeah, it is.
They have a patent.

26:32.191 --> 26:33.625
Yeah.
Yeah. We have a fully--

26:33.625 --> 26:37.096
What I learned, the patent,
you have to actually protect.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.864
And we would--
We were suing people like

26:38.864 --> 26:39.865
Whac-A-Mole out there.

26:39.865 --> 26:42.334
I think the product
is great,

26:42.334 --> 26:44.136
but the problems ahead
are great, too.

26:44.136 --> 26:45.571
I'm out.

26:45.571 --> 26:46.572
Thank you, Kevin.
Thank you.

26:46.572 --> 26:47.673
Listen, you guys,

26:47.673 --> 26:50.742
I think that you're fabulous.

26:50.742 --> 26:53.112
But you're very,
very small right now.

26:53.112 --> 26:55.514
It's not an investment
for me.

26:55.514 --> 26:57.549
I wish you good luck,
but I'm out.

26:57.549 --> 26:58.784
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.

26:58.784 --> 27:00.119
Guys, you're on
an amazing journey.

27:00.119 --> 27:03.155
It's just really a tough
business for an investment.

27:03.155 --> 27:05.390
I mean, you gotta run it
the way you wanna run it.

27:05.390 --> 27:06.792
And I understand
there's some shortcuts

27:06.792 --> 27:08.560
by having a Shark to help... Right.

27:08.560 --> 27:10.829
...but the way you've been
doing it is perfect.

27:10.829 --> 27:12.264
I think you guys
will do great things.

27:12.264 --> 27:15.267
It's just not a fit for me.
So for those reasons, I'm out.

27:15.267 --> 27:16.368
Thanks, Mark.
Congratulations, guys.

27:16.368 --> 27:17.836
Thanks, Mark.

27:17.836 --> 27:19.838
You have a whole
club of people adoring you,
I'm sure.

27:19.838 --> 27:21.607
Wherever you go, right?

27:21.607 --> 27:24.376
And I can't figure out
why you haven't sold more.

27:24.376 --> 27:26.612
The only answer
I can give myself

27:26.612 --> 27:28.347
is you haven't done
social media.

27:28.347 --> 27:31.650
It took you 10 years
with this amount of sales. Right.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.285
I'm not impressed with.

27:33.285 --> 27:34.987
I know you've put in
all the effort. Sure.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.822
And I know you're the walking,
talking example

27:36.822 --> 27:37.856
of a young entrepreneur.

27:37.856 --> 27:39.391
I'm not taking away
from that,

27:39.391 --> 27:40.993
but something's wrong.

27:40.993 --> 27:43.095
I mean, it's a cool product.

27:43.095 --> 27:44.997
You're the right
spokespeople for it.

27:44.997 --> 27:47.399
The biggest thing is
we're just undercapitalized.

27:47.399 --> 27:48.667
We-- We know
what we want to do.

27:48.667 --> 27:49.735
I don't think so.

27:49.735 --> 27:51.303
There's a lot of
young businesses that have

27:51.303 --> 27:53.572
long waiting lists of
customers who are willing to wait

27:53.572 --> 27:55.374
'cause they're in love
with the product.

27:55.374 --> 27:57.176
So I wish you luck.
I'm sure you'll do well.

27:57.176 --> 27:58.210
But I'm out.

27:58.210 --> 27:59.211
Thank you, Barbara.

27:59.211 --> 28:00.712
I'm impressed with it.

28:00.712 --> 28:03.549
You know, I think it takes us
all back to our young days.

28:03.549 --> 28:06.051
We're projected in year one
of Action Glow2

28:06.051 --> 28:09.021
to do $430,000.

28:09.021 --> 28:10.923
How do I know you're gonna
sell that amount?

28:10.923 --> 28:12.491
I've been where
you want to go.

28:12.491 --> 28:15.160
I've built the size of
companies you want to build.

28:15.160 --> 28:17.829
You just got to do it with
a little more discipline, right?

28:17.829 --> 28:20.232
'Cause high-energy people
tend to be like,

28:20.232 --> 28:22.501
"Ahh! Squirrel," right?

28:22.501 --> 28:24.036
That's true.
That's what I'm here for.

28:24.036 --> 28:26.104
Dakota's that
high-energy person.
That's me, yeah.

28:26.104 --> 28:27.406
And I'm here
to reel him in.

28:27.406 --> 28:29.007
I think you need
a little discipline.

28:29.007 --> 28:30.409
You're asking for $200,000?

28:30.409 --> 28:31.643
Yeah.
Yes, correct.

28:31.643 --> 28:34.513
How much of the business
do I own

28:34.513 --> 28:37.149
for it to be interesting
for me and--

28:37.149 --> 28:39.952
Robert, let me guess--
it's gonna be more than 15%.

28:39.952 --> 28:41.820
Wow. It's like you have
a crystal ball, Kevin. Yes.

28:43.488 --> 28:45.857
All right, guys.
It's an investment in you guys.

28:45.857 --> 28:47.459
A lot of stuff to figure out.

28:47.459 --> 28:48.527
Sure.

28:48.527 --> 28:50.729
I'll give you
the $200,000 for 30%.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.064
I knew
he was gonna say that.

28:52.064 --> 28:53.665
This is-- First off,
this is incredible.

28:53.665 --> 28:54.866
And thank you so much.
Yeah. Thank you.

28:54.866 --> 28:57.069
Robert, will you be
willing to do 20%?

28:57.069 --> 28:59.438
No, no. No.
$200,000 for 20%?

28:59.438 --> 29:01.106
How about 25%?
No.

29:01.106 --> 29:03.442
Could you see yourself
getting to 25%?
No. No.

29:03.442 --> 29:06.011
Guys, you've been trying
to get in here for 10 years,

29:06.011 --> 29:07.379
and now you have an offer.

29:07.379 --> 29:09.081
Don't blow it.

29:09.081 --> 29:11.149
Okay.

29:14.987 --> 29:16.555
What is going on?

29:16.555 --> 29:19.891
Robert, it's time to hop on
board, Robert.
Oh, yeah, baby!

29:19.891 --> 29:21.827
We've got a deal!

29:22.828 --> 29:25.163
Guys.
Hey, thank you so much.

29:25.163 --> 29:27.399
Oh, my God. Thank you.
Congratulations, guys.

29:27.399 --> 29:28.500
Congrats, guys.

29:28.500 --> 29:30.135
Can I keep the board?

29:30.135 --> 29:32.371
You can keep the board!
It's yours!
Yes! Keep the board.
It's yours!

29:32.371 --> 29:33.872
Congrats, guys.

29:34.873 --> 29:36.408
Oh, my God.

29:37.376 --> 29:39.311
We've been waiting
10 years to get into the Tank,

29:39.311 --> 29:42.481
and we just made a deal
with our dream Shark, Robert.

29:42.481 --> 29:43.715
We couldn't be
any more excited,

29:43.715 --> 29:46.385
and we hope that our story
and dedication

29:46.385 --> 29:49.454
inspires the next generation
of young entrepreneurs.

30:00.399 --> 30:01.700
Next into the Tank

30:01.700 --> 30:05.037
is an innovation
to a classic grooming ritual.

30:14.746 --> 30:16.948
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Mike Gutow.

30:16.948 --> 30:18.550
I am from Metro Detroit, Michigan,

30:18.550 --> 30:20.852
and I'm seeking
a $300,000 investment

30:20.852 --> 30:25.490
for 10% equity of a company
that has patented technology

30:25.490 --> 30:30.128
that is set to disrupt a $50
billion a year global industry.

30:30.128 --> 30:32.698
Sharks, I'm talking
about the shaving industry.

30:35.801 --> 30:37.402
So what's the problem
with shaving?

30:37.402 --> 30:39.004
Well, see, we put shaving
cream on like this,

30:39.004 --> 30:41.006
you're doing the adverse thing
you should be doing.

30:41.006 --> 30:42.741
I'm not exfoliating my skin.

30:42.741 --> 30:44.710
I'm closing the pores
of my face up,

30:44.710 --> 30:47.145
and I'm actually matting
my hair follicles down.

30:47.145 --> 30:49.047
Now, I'm gonna go to run
my raise over my face,

30:49.047 --> 30:50.749
I end up ripping
and pulling my hairs out,

30:50.749 --> 30:54.019
which gives me the razor bumps
and burns we all hate.

30:54.019 --> 30:56.221
Not only that, look at the
mess and the waste this
creates!

30:56.221 --> 30:57.656
More than half the product
I don't even use

30:57.656 --> 30:59.925
gets washed down the drain.

30:59.925 --> 31:01.593
But this is not how
Grandpa shaved.

31:01.593 --> 31:02.627
You see, with all
the advancements

31:02.627 --> 31:03.995
in the shaving industry,

31:03.995 --> 31:06.164
the one thing
that has been overlooked

31:06.164 --> 31:07.599
has been this shave brush.

31:07.599 --> 31:09.468
But we don't have time
for this anymore.

31:09.468 --> 31:13.004
This is why we created
Legacy Shave,

31:13.004 --> 31:15.907
the world's
first universal patented

31:15.907 --> 31:18.143
shave brush and dispenser
all in one.

31:18.143 --> 31:20.612
This is a modern shave brush
for modern times.

31:20.612 --> 31:22.147
Watch how quick
and easy this is.

31:22.147 --> 31:24.850
One small pump, the product
comes right through the brush.

31:24.850 --> 31:26.418
Oh, wow.
This little bit.

31:26.418 --> 31:28.353
This is all you need.

31:28.353 --> 31:29.821
Now you apply it
to your face or body.

31:29.821 --> 31:31.656
You're doing exactly
what you should be doing.

31:31.656 --> 31:33.492
I'm exfoliating my skin.

31:33.492 --> 31:35.127
I'm cleaning out
the pores in my face.

31:35.127 --> 31:36.661
I'm stimulating
my hair follicles,

31:36.661 --> 31:38.296
sticking them out and up.

31:38.296 --> 31:40.432
Now when I go
to run the razor on my face,

31:40.432 --> 31:42.734
I get the cleanest,
closest shave possible.

31:42.734 --> 31:46.204
Goodbye razor bumps and burns,
and goodbye mess and waste.

31:50.108 --> 31:51.476
Great job.

31:51.476 --> 31:52.978
But here's
the amazing part, Sharks.

31:52.978 --> 31:57.315
Legacy Shave fits every single
manufacturer out there.

31:57.315 --> 31:59.184
Doesn't matter make or model.
Oh, wow.

31:59.184 --> 32:02.287
Oh.
Men or women's,
foam or gel cans.

32:02.287 --> 32:04.322
Even down to the travel sizes.

32:04.322 --> 32:06.191
- Very good.
- Wow.
- It fits them all.

32:06.191 --> 32:08.693
Sharks, I ask you...

32:08.693 --> 32:12.264
who wants to use your legacy
and join team Legacy Shave

32:12.264 --> 32:14.933
and let's disrupt the
$50 billion a year industry

32:14.933 --> 32:16.134
together?

32:16.134 --> 32:18.570
Let's go!

32:18.570 --> 32:20.338
- Whoo!
- Let's hear it for Mike!

32:20.338 --> 32:23.074
Best presentation ever, Mike. Wow.

32:23.074 --> 32:24.810
How does it work, Mike?

32:24.810 --> 32:26.745
Do a couple small,
gentle pumps.

32:26.745 --> 32:28.480
Yeah, there you go.
A lot comes out.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.015
Yeah, a-a little bit, Robert

32:30.015 --> 32:31.783
Perfect.
That's all you need.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.552
Oh, this is good
shaving cream.

32:33.552 --> 32:34.886
It's amazing
shaving cream.

32:34.886 --> 32:38.390
It's clean ingredients
infused very heavy with aloe.

32:38.390 --> 32:39.825
What do you sell it for?

32:39.825 --> 32:42.060
We sell that for $24.95.

32:42.060 --> 32:43.094
What does it cost you
to make?

32:43.094 --> 32:45.564
It cost me $5.39 to make.

32:45.564 --> 32:47.732
Just a brush
we sell for $19.95.

32:47.732 --> 32:48.967
How did you come up with this?

32:48.967 --> 32:50.502
28 years ago,

32:50.502 --> 32:53.238
we gave my dad a gift
for Father's Day

32:53.238 --> 32:54.339
that we thought he would love.

32:54.339 --> 32:57.209
See, my dad was
a daily shaver,

32:57.209 --> 32:59.277
and he always complained
about how his electric razor

32:59.277 --> 33:01.279
would always give him
razor bumps or burns.

33:01.279 --> 33:03.048
So my brother and I
got him a really expensive,

33:03.048 --> 33:04.449
old-fashioned shave brush,

33:04.449 --> 33:06.751
and he just looks at us and
goes, "You know what, guys?

33:06.751 --> 33:08.453
I'm not gonna
be able to use this.

33:08.453 --> 33:11.690
It's just not for me.
I don't have time for this."

33:11.690 --> 33:14.259
Well, crushed and devastated,
my brother and I were like,

33:14.259 --> 33:16.495
this got to be a different
way. So the idea came up--

33:16.495 --> 33:17.629
Well, why don't you just
put a brush on that,

33:17.629 --> 33:19.364
and now you have
a shave brush?

33:19.364 --> 33:20.899
We ran to the hardware store.

33:20.899 --> 33:23.101
My dad picked a big clay putty

33:23.101 --> 33:24.970
that you could mold
and form and shape,

33:24.970 --> 33:26.972
and a disposable paint brush.

33:26.972 --> 33:28.373
Next day, we wake up.

33:28.373 --> 33:31.276
My dad just comes
strutting down the aisle,

33:31.276 --> 33:33.945
smiling ear to ear,
just like that.

33:33.945 --> 33:35.347
And we're like,
"What are you so happy for?

33:35.347 --> 33:38.183
You're never happy
in a morning."

33:38.183 --> 33:39.885
He goes, "Don't you two
knuckleheads remember

33:39.885 --> 33:42.287
the shave brush
we invented yesterday?

33:42.287 --> 33:44.389
Well, it worked!
It's awesome!

33:44.389 --> 33:46.491
I never had a better shave."
That's great.

33:46.491 --> 33:49.294
So my dad, he knew
a plastic injection molder.

33:49.294 --> 33:52.597
Four months later,
we get 20 prototypes back.

33:52.597 --> 33:54.533
And this is where things
kind of

33:54.533 --> 33:56.101
took a turn
for the worst, Sharks.

33:56.101 --> 33:57.369
Fear.

33:57.369 --> 33:59.604
And it's been documented
several times,

33:59.604 --> 34:01.907
that people have ideas
and inventions

34:01.907 --> 34:04.709
that they spend money,
patents to protect it,

34:04.709 --> 34:06.144
their whole entire
life savings to bring up

34:06.144 --> 34:07.345
with a new idea and concept

34:07.345 --> 34:10.081
only to have the
bigger companies rip them off.

34:10.081 --> 34:11.850
And it's basically
David vs. Goliath.

34:11.850 --> 34:13.952
And we sat there in fear,

34:13.952 --> 34:15.120
and that's basically
where it sat

34:15.120 --> 34:17.489
for literally 20 years, Sharks.

34:17.489 --> 34:20.358
Unfortunately,
my dad passed away from cancer.

34:20.358 --> 34:21.493
Sorry.

34:21.493 --> 34:23.194
Years after
my dad passed away,

34:23.194 --> 34:25.564
my brother and I
go down to his basement

34:25.564 --> 34:27.899
and there sits
my dad's workbench.

34:27.899 --> 34:29.734
I open up those boxes,
and, Sharks,

34:29.734 --> 34:31.002
remember I told you
we only thought we had

34:31.002 --> 34:32.604
20 or 30 prototypes?

34:32.604 --> 34:34.806
Well, they're sat 3,000...

34:34.806 --> 34:36.341
What?!

34:36.341 --> 34:38.510
...of our original prototypes
from 28 years ago...

34:38.510 --> 34:41.680
Oh, my God.
...that my dad had sat
and assembled

34:41.680 --> 34:44.616
during his chemo treatment
time to keep himself busy.

34:44.616 --> 34:47.586
Wow.
He knew we would
eventually see this.

34:47.586 --> 34:50.989
And, Sharks,
he left one more thing for us.

34:50.989 --> 34:52.457
What?
A note.

34:52.457 --> 34:54.459
A message beyond the grave.

34:54.459 --> 34:58.029
That said, "Don't wait.
Life's short. Take the shot."

34:58.029 --> 34:59.064
Wow.
Wow.

34:59.064 --> 35:00.065
It was at that
point in time,

35:00.065 --> 35:01.533
my brother and I
just looked at ourselves

35:01.533 --> 35:03.501
and said,
"We have to do this."

35:03.501 --> 35:05.503
And what is
the difference now

35:05.503 --> 35:07.872
that was different
from 28 years ago?

35:07.872 --> 35:10.542
There's a very
popular show on TV

35:10.542 --> 35:13.078
that gave entrepreneurs
a chance

35:13.078 --> 35:15.947
to showcase their products
to millions of people.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.315
What show is that?

35:17.315 --> 35:18.516
It's "Shark Tank"!

35:20.552 --> 35:24.289
And-- And it was because
the show is out there,

35:24.289 --> 35:26.524
my brother and I got the
courage to say, "You know
what?

35:26.524 --> 35:29.327
This gives David versus
Goliath a chance."

35:29.327 --> 35:30.662
You guys are a rock.

35:30.662 --> 35:32.497
And the last thing
that we wanted to do

35:32.497 --> 35:35.600
is to be on our deathbeds
wondering "What if?"

35:35.600 --> 35:37.569
And, so, that's when
the process started.

35:37.569 --> 35:39.904
I understand now why
you called it Legacy Shave.

35:39.904 --> 35:41.439
Yes. Yes.
Great call.
What a great legacy.

35:41.439 --> 35:43.408
But let's get
back into the business.

35:43.408 --> 35:45.944
What are your sales
for this product?

35:45.944 --> 35:48.246
To date, we sold over
100,000 units

35:48.246 --> 35:49.547
and did over $1 million
in sales.

35:49.547 --> 35:51.583
100,000 units.
100,000 units.

35:51.583 --> 35:53.184
$1 million dollars.
And that's over
what period of time?

35:53.184 --> 35:54.653
Five-- Five years.

35:54.653 --> 35:56.821
Give us the sales
over the last five years.

35:56.821 --> 35:57.889
Year by year.

35:57.889 --> 35:59.658
Year one,
we did about $70,000.

35:59.658 --> 36:00.725
Did you make any money
that year?

36:00.725 --> 36:02.193
We have not.
Okay, year two.

36:02.193 --> 36:04.996
In fact, we've been in the red
every single year, Sharks.

36:04.996 --> 36:06.264
Year two.
Year two?

36:06.264 --> 36:07.799
$370,000.

36:07.799 --> 36:09.901
Year three,
we did about $390,000.

36:09.901 --> 36:11.469
Last year,
what were the sales last year?
O'Leary: Okay.

36:11.469 --> 36:13.338
Last year
was close to $96,000.

36:13.338 --> 36:14.706
And what will
they be this year?

36:14.706 --> 36:16.574
So far, we've done $42,000.

36:16.574 --> 36:18.843
But we do have
a purchase order for $63,000.

36:18.843 --> 36:21.212
The trend is not your friend,
Mike. What's going on?

36:21.212 --> 36:24.115
Here-- Here--
$390,000, then they
start dropping. Why?

36:24.115 --> 36:26.618
We're a family, bootstrap,
start-up company.

36:26.618 --> 36:28.553
We've taken it
as far as we can.

36:28.553 --> 36:29.888
We're out of money.

36:29.888 --> 36:32.657
How much have you lost
over the five years?

36:32.657 --> 36:35.293
To date, as a family,
we have personally invested

36:35.293 --> 36:37.562
over $400,000
into this business.

36:37.562 --> 36:40.765
And, Sharks, we really try to
be a direct-to-consumer
product.

36:40.765 --> 36:44.903
However, my brother and I,
you know, we're trying our best.

36:44.903 --> 36:46.604
We're not geniuses behind us,
and money's tight.

36:46.604 --> 36:50.308
Mike, Mike, let me just
interrupt you just for a moment.

36:50.308 --> 36:54.679
My large concern with you
is you're a phenomenal salesman,

36:54.679 --> 36:56.347
but you're not
a clear communicator.

36:56.347 --> 36:57.449
You're all over the map.

36:57.449 --> 36:59.184
And I don't think
we'd be great partners.

36:59.184 --> 37:00.985
For that reason,
I'm out.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.289
It's-- It's not a good set
of circumstances for us

37:04.289 --> 37:05.623
that you're out of money, right?

37:05.623 --> 37:09.327
So, it's not a fit for me.
I wish you guys the best.

37:09.327 --> 37:11.663
But for those reasons,
I'm out.

37:11.663 --> 37:14.232
You haven't even seen the best
thing about this product.

37:14.232 --> 37:17.736
Our patents do not just cover
the shaving industry.

37:17.736 --> 37:22.207
Our patents cover the entire
aerosol industry out there.

37:22.207 --> 37:24.642
Cleaning products?
Multiple billion-dollar-a-year
industries

37:24.642 --> 37:26.511
that our invention changes.

37:26.511 --> 37:28.413
Rather than an air duster just
being like a little stream,

37:28.413 --> 37:29.481
it's a power air duster.

37:29.481 --> 37:31.816
The note is take a shot
on the shaving.

37:31.816 --> 37:34.285
That was your-- your dad
talking to you

37:34.285 --> 37:36.020
from beyond the grave,
which was very moving.

37:36.020 --> 37:37.489
I've been on "Shark Tank"
for 14 years.

37:37.489 --> 37:38.957
I've never heard
a story like this.

37:38.957 --> 37:43.695
So, the-- the shaving
category that you're competing in

37:43.695 --> 37:47.499
is incredibly crowded
and dominated by behemoths.

37:47.499 --> 37:50.068
It's-- It's a really
big challenge.

37:50.068 --> 37:52.470
Um, I'm not gonna take
that journey with you.

37:52.470 --> 37:54.339
I'm out.

37:54.339 --> 37:57.075
I see a lot of
challenges with it.

37:57.075 --> 37:58.409
I wish you all the best,

37:58.409 --> 38:01.379
but I-I don't want to be
in the shaving cream business.

38:01.379 --> 38:03.982
So, Mike, it's not for me.
I'm out.

38:03.982 --> 38:06.818
But I think Lori still
hasn't made up her mind.
I'm left.

38:06.818 --> 38:10.388
I really like the
interchangeability of this cap

38:10.388 --> 38:14.592
onto anything,
and I like the thought of

38:14.592 --> 38:16.628
that there are other things
that you can do with it

38:16.628 --> 38:17.896
and that you have
a patent.

38:17.896 --> 38:20.431
Now, all that being said,

38:20.431 --> 38:22.267
you don't have many sales.

38:22.267 --> 38:23.968
You haven't proven this.

38:23.968 --> 38:26.471
But I also look at it
as your family and you

38:26.471 --> 38:27.939
don't have
a lot of experience

38:27.939 --> 38:30.575
in the consumer product world.

38:30.575 --> 38:33.945
Um, I'm gonna take
a real flier on you, Mike...

38:33.945 --> 38:36.881
Wow.
...because this is really
not, like, something

38:36.881 --> 38:39.184
I ever would think
I would invest in.

38:39.184 --> 38:41.519
But I also know a good product
when I see it.

38:41.519 --> 38:44.789
So I'm gonna give you
a royalty deal,

38:44.789 --> 38:46.758
but it's not like
Kevin's.

38:46.758 --> 38:51.329
I'm gonna give you $1 million
for 100% of your company.

38:51.329 --> 38:52.730
Whoa.
What?

38:52.730 --> 38:55.967
Wow.
And I will give you
a royalty of 3%

38:55.967 --> 39:00.038
of the net sales
for life. Wow.

39:00.038 --> 39:03.942
I'm going to give you $1
million to buy out your patents,

39:03.942 --> 39:06.110
the product,
the everything.

39:06.110 --> 39:07.178
Yowza.

39:16.821 --> 39:19.057
Four Sharks are out.

39:19.057 --> 39:21.860
Lori is Mike's last chance
for a deal,

39:21.860 --> 39:25.096
and she has made
a surprising $1 million offer

39:25.096 --> 39:29.067
for 100% of his shaving
brush company Legacy Shave.

39:29.067 --> 39:31.102
I'm going to
give you $1 million

39:31.102 --> 39:35.273
to buy out your patents,
the product, the everything.

39:35.273 --> 39:36.674
Yowza.

39:36.674 --> 39:38.576
You won't have
to do anything anymore.

39:38.576 --> 39:40.478
I will try to give it
a go.

39:40.478 --> 39:42.747
I'm pretty good at this
kind of thing.

39:42.747 --> 39:46.584
And then I will
give you 3% of net sales

39:46.584 --> 39:49.053
on whatever I sell
for life.

39:49.053 --> 39:50.889
My decision, though,
was based on

39:50.889 --> 39:53.424
that this is probably
the coolest shaving experience

39:53.424 --> 39:54.993
I have ever felt.

39:54.993 --> 39:56.961
It is really wonderful.

39:56.961 --> 39:58.730
Yes or no, Mike?
$1 million buys you out.

39:58.730 --> 40:00.398
And you can counter.
You can counter some, Mike, too.

40:00.398 --> 40:03.234
Would you be willing
to do that offer

40:03.234 --> 40:07.005
where we can have 5% equity
of our company still?

40:07.005 --> 40:11.075
And that way it guarantees us
that we can carry on our legacy.

40:11.075 --> 40:13.678
That's very smart, Mike.
That's called schmuck insurance.

40:13.678 --> 40:15.780
And explain why
that's so smart, Mark.

40:15.780 --> 40:18.249
'Cause if it turns into
an amazing deal,

40:18.249 --> 40:19.751
you don't want
to look like a schmuck

40:19.751 --> 40:22.120
because you gave away
the whole thing, right?

40:22.120 --> 40:24.789
And so by retaining 5%,
when Lori turns this

40:24.789 --> 40:27.592
into a $10 million
or $20 million company,

40:27.592 --> 40:29.761
then your 5%
is actually worth something.

40:29.761 --> 40:31.195
O'Leary: Mike,
you don't even need that

40:31.195 --> 40:33.498
because I am the royalty king.
Let me explain what happens.

40:33.498 --> 40:35.934
If she gets bought out
by a big shaving company,

40:35.934 --> 40:38.136
they're gonna want to
buy out your royal.
That's true, too.

40:38.136 --> 40:39.671
That is your schmuck
insurance. Yeah, you're right.

40:39.671 --> 40:42.407
You can get, advanced, all
that royalty into one check.

40:43.341 --> 40:47.145
So technically, I mean,
you don't have to do that.

40:47.145 --> 40:48.179
But if you--
W--

40:48.179 --> 40:52.083
If you want schmuck insurance,
so to speak,

40:52.083 --> 40:54.018
then I would come down
in the money I'm giving you

40:54.018 --> 40:56.988
because now you're retaining
5% of your company, right?

40:56.988 --> 40:58.723
But not much, Lori. So...

40:58.723 --> 41:01.426
Well, he came in asking
for $300,000 for 10%.
It's $50,000.

41:01.426 --> 41:03.561
So now you're $950,000?
So, I would go down--

41:03.561 --> 41:04.929
No. $700,000.

41:04.929 --> 41:07.031
Oh, that's a big dip.

41:10.568 --> 41:12.103
What do you want to do,
Mike?

41:12.103 --> 41:15.206
I'm willing to risk $300,000.

41:15.206 --> 41:17.108
I still want to have equity
in this company

41:17.108 --> 41:18.376
along with my brother.

41:18.376 --> 41:21.579
It's worth over
$100 million, easily.

41:21.579 --> 41:23.047
Lori, I take that deal,

41:23.047 --> 41:25.483
but I'll take it
with the $700,000

41:25.483 --> 41:27.318
'cause I know that this is
gonna be more than that,

41:27.318 --> 41:29.520
and we can still retain
5% equity of our company.

41:29.520 --> 41:30.955
All right.

41:30.955 --> 41:32.657
Good job, Mike.
Good for you, Mike.

41:32.657 --> 41:33.891
Thank you, guys.

41:33.891 --> 41:36.594
I bet you didn't
expect that today.
This is amazing.

41:36.594 --> 41:38.629
Oh, my gosh.
This is so incredible.

41:38.629 --> 41:39.931
Amazing!

41:39.931 --> 41:41.666
O'Leary: Take the shot, Mike.
Take the shot.

41:41.666 --> 41:42.967
We're taking the shot, Lori.

41:42.967 --> 41:45.003
Thank you.
We're taking the shot, Mike.

41:45.003 --> 41:46.504
What would your dad
think of this moment?

41:46.504 --> 41:49.340
I think he--
he's damn proud.

41:49.340 --> 41:50.942
And in fact, I know--
In fact, I even

41:50.942 --> 41:52.677
wore his ring
here today with me

41:52.677 --> 41:54.145
so he can be with me.

41:54.145 --> 41:56.214
And I know he's standing
next to us right now

41:56.214 --> 41:59.250
and saying, "Way to go,
you two knuckleheads."

41:59.250 --> 42:01.586
Let's go!
We're gonna do it!

42:01.586 --> 42:03.488
Thanks, guys.
O'Leary: Thank you, Mike.
Thank you.

42:05.590 --> 42:09.227
I just can't wait to celebrate
with my mom and my brother.

42:09.227 --> 42:13.164
It-- It's come full circle,
and here we are.

42:13.164 --> 42:15.233
And we're ready
to move forward.

42:15.233 --> 42:18.536
And as a family, we're gonna
take that next step.

42:18.536 --> 42:21.472
And I know that this is gonna
become something

42:21.472 --> 42:23.141
even greater than we all imagined.

42:29.113 --> 42:32.116
