19:38.172 --> 19:39.965
And I'm not good
at a lot of things.

19:40.034 --> 19:41.620
- She's right, Your Honor.

19:41.689 --> 19:44.862
I'm not even thinking,
and I could list, like, 50.

19:44.931 --> 19:46.517
- But she's an amazing friend,

19:46.586 --> 19:50.034
in spite of her many,
many flaws.

19:50.689 --> 19:54.896
- But one thing
that I am good at

19:54.965 --> 19:56.724
is dancing.

19:56.793 --> 19:59.931
And I finally got the chance
to show the world

20:00.000 --> 20:02.310
by creating my own dance move.

20:02.379 --> 20:05.241
But then ZooZoo
took credit for it.

20:05.310 --> 20:07.827
And that's not fair.

20:07.896 --> 20:11.137
So now I'm just a girl,

20:11.206 --> 20:13.275
standing in front of a judge,

20:13.344 --> 20:15.655
asking her to believe me.

20:17.241 --> 20:19.827
- That was a moving speech,

20:19.896 --> 20:22.103
so I'm going
to rule in your favor...

20:22.172 --> 20:26.655
Is what I would say if I wasn't
such a big fan of ZooZoo.

20:28.413 --> 20:29.965
- Order in the court!

20:30.034 --> 20:33.379
Objection!
Stop the presses!

20:33.448 --> 20:35.172
- Oh, good.
This is the fifth courtroom

20:35.241 --> 20:37.379
he's busted into like that.

20:38.172 --> 20:39.724
- Your Honor,
I have one more witness.

20:39.793 --> 20:41.517
Last one, promise.

20:41.586 --> 20:43.517
- Fine.

20:43.586 --> 20:44.862
[dramatic musical sting]

20:44.931 --> 20:47.206
- Your Honor,
this video from yesterday

20:47.275 --> 20:49.172
will shed new light
on this case.

20:51.344 --> 20:54.689
- Number 27--
- [laughing]

20:54.758 --> 20:56.724
I'm just leaving
the courthouse.

20:56.793 --> 20:58.551
I was just pretending
to be injured

20:58.620 --> 21:00.172
'cause the dance
I'm taking credit for

21:00.241 --> 21:01.551
is too hard for me
to pull off.

21:01.620 --> 21:04.862
And the judge
seems like an idiot.

21:08.793 --> 21:10.931
- I would also like
to submit into evidence

21:11.000 --> 21:13.758
that she broke
several crosswalk don'ts.

21:16.034 --> 21:17.103
- ZooZoo.

21:17.172 --> 21:19.482
It's clear that you are a liar

21:19.551 --> 21:22.000
and unnecessarily mean.

21:23.344 --> 21:26.517
Therefore, I rule
that the dance in question

21:26.586 --> 21:28.068
will hereby be known as

21:28.137 --> 21:29.827
the Presley Slide.

21:33.137 --> 21:34.482
- I only went through with this

21:34.551 --> 21:36.482
because you said
we were going to win!

21:36.551 --> 21:37.689
- Well, we would have,

21:37.758 --> 21:40.379
if it wasn't for
this boat lawyer!

21:40.448 --> 21:43.586
- I'm also a boat doctor.

21:44.068 --> 21:45.896
Your Honor,
permission for a victory dance?

21:45.965 --> 21:47.586
- I'll allow it.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.551
- ♪ Because I'm
not from this ♪

21:53.620 --> 21:56.068
♪ Not from this,
I'm not from this world ♪

21:56.137 --> 21:58.103
♪ Because I'm not from this,
not from this ♪

21:58.172 --> 22:00.896
♪ Not from this world ♪
