00:31.300 --> 00:33.500
Let's start from the beginning, will you?

00:34.860 --> 00:37.550
Oh, well... I didn't ask, do you want something to drink?

00:37.820 --> 00:39.090
You are very kind but don't worry.

00:40.520 --> 00:41.520
Can you look at me?

00:43.380 --> 00:44.860
Yes of course

00:47.850 --> 00:51.090
Erika told me about her arrival, that night...

01:19.570 --> 01:21.450
Turn right and then turn on the left

01:42.200 --> 01:42.920
Fuck you!

01:49.770 --> 01:51.320
Go on for three kilometers

01:53.270 --> 01:55.590
Take the second exit at the roundabout

06:14.760 --> 06:18.790
Why?! He was a cheat and he used to beat me

06:19.140 --> 06:20.840
don’t you think that was enough?

06:21.770 --> 06:24.890
And so you just left... so typical of you!

06:25.900 --> 06:30.910
Yeah, and as a punishment I have ended up in Dracula’s mansion

06:31.560 --> 06:33.320
fighting against rats!

06:35.940 --> 06:38.610
To tell you the truth, that house has always made me anxious

06:38.640 --> 06:40.880
that’s why I’ve always kept away from there

06:41.060 --> 06:43.440
It's been virtually uninhabited since my parents died.

06:44.150 --> 06:44.570
Great!

06:45.910 --> 06:48.100
Come on, in a couple of days it’s gonna be like new again

06:49.010 --> 06:51.770
Until a few years ago, my aunt still used to pay the electricity bill

06:52.070 --> 06:55.780
I never figured out why. But she was like 80...

06:56.250 --> 06:59.580
Okay. I gotta get to work now...

07:00.110 --> 07:03.010
And, joking aside, thanks

07:03.370 --> 07:04.600
you saved my life

07:04.930 --> 07:07.020
For such a small thing?

07:07.460 --> 07:09.580
Wait! Look at this, what do you think about it?

07:15.110 --> 07:16.070
It’s for the new shooting.

07:17.950 --> 07:20.800
Same old Jenny! Anyway, it’s very sexy.

07:20.880 --> 07:23.750
Say hi to your gorgeous husband

07:24.080 --> 07:28.150
if he wants me back to Chicago for a fashion show... I’m here!

07:29.180 --> 07:31.560
I really need a change in my life.

07:33.850 --> 07:34.760
Lol! Kisses bad chick!

10:41.130 --> 10:44.240
come on, get out... show yourself

10:55.130 --> 10:58.720
Come on, this way, you're the best

11:14.240 --> 11:18.120
Yeah, come on ... take off everything...

11:54.740 --> 11:57.020
So you're telling me that Erika was a prostitute?

11:57.850 --> 11:59.470
This was not in the police reports

11:59.650 --> 12:02.450
Well, I wouldn't say that

12:02.900 --> 12:05.440
She was a model and an actress.

12:05.440 --> 12:09.140
But sometimes she also used that method to raise some money.

12:09.140 --> 12:11.530
Ok, ok. Let's go on, will you?

13:45.290 --> 13:46.060
Hello?

13:51.120 --> 13:53.450
Hello... who is it...?

14:03.290 --> 14:05.130
So at first she had no problems.

14:06.720 --> 14:09.210
No. She was settling down.

14:10.430 --> 14:14.400
She was a strong person, who reacted well in every situation.

14:15.450 --> 14:18.860
She desperately tried to get rid of her old life.

14:19.800 --> 14:22.090
She told me she had also met someone in the village.

14:23.340 --> 14:27.200
They were not very hospitable people, you know, anyway better than nothing...

14:53.320 --> 14:54.780
May help you, miss?

14:55.350 --> 14:56.210
Thank you

15:07.330 --> 15:10.420
I don't know how to thank you. You are very kind.

15:12.300 --> 15:14.590
I could be even more advanced now.

16:47.740 --> 16:48.870
Who is it?!

17:24.619 --> 17:29.240
Hey! Are you still here?

17:54.420 --> 17:56.230
What did you forget?

18:08.420 --> 18:09.420
Who the hell is it?!

18:36.440 --> 18:37.580
What happened?!

18:40.350 --> 18:42.550
Why are you still here?

18:42.650 --> 18:46.130
I forgot my cigarettes... And I also

18:47.220 --> 18:48.570
wanted to say goodbye...

18:51.610 --> 18:54.120
Don’t you ever just get tired?

18:55.260 --> 18:57.660
Go get your cigarettes.

18:58.430 --> 18:59.350
Allright

19:00.430 --> 19:01.680
Good night.

19:39.990 --> 19:41.310
Wake up, bitch

19:47.730 --> 19:50.790
You know, you'll burn in Hell for this

19:54.700 --> 19:57.510
You gave me so much pleasure

20:01.850 --> 20:03.050
Now die

20:12.940 --> 20:15.350
You've finally arrived

20:16.390 --> 20:19.220
We all was waiting for you

20:46.390 --> 20:49.270
I'm gonna call the police!

20:58.070 --> 20:59.720
I don’t know what to say, sweetheart. Really.

21:00.230 --> 21:04.890
So, you’ve never heard any weird story about this house?

21:05.970 --> 21:08.350
What do you mean by weird?!

21:09.370 --> 21:14.960
You know, voices, visions... You said it scared you.

21:15.960 --> 21:18.820
Oh, come on! I was scared as a little girl just because it was isolated.

21:19.540 --> 21:21.120
No weird story.

21:21.790 --> 21:25.900
You’re just being influenced by loneliness and silence

21:27.260 --> 21:33.530
But I receive phone calls from unknown numbers. I see ghostly shadows

21:34.180 --> 21:36.480
and I keep having nightmares

21:36.850 --> 21:38.310
Are you sure it’s not your ex boyfriend?

21:38.960 --> 21:41.750
Often men that are violent are also vengeful, you know?

21:42.480 --> 21:43.480
Perhaps

21:43.960 --> 21:47.160
Listen, how come it’s so difficult for you to find someone to spend the night with you?

21:48.040 --> 21:50.550
That way, you would at least deal with the nightmares’ problem!

21:51.230 --> 21:52.900
Oh... that’s not really an issue.

21:54.830 --> 21:59.020
One thing I liked as a kid was swinging in the patio. Is the swing still there?

21:59.550 --> 22:00.380
Patio?

22:01.590 --> 22:04.380
It was many years ago. Then they did some renovation work

22:04.380 --> 22:06.850
but I had already stopped going by that time

22:07.320 --> 22:10.000
Do you actually get better instead of aging?

22:11.060 --> 22:13.340
Do you prefer more slender types?

22:14.010 --> 22:16.900
More slender? Everything’s perfect there

22:16.900 --> 22:20.370
it almost stimulates my male part!

22:22.100 --> 22:25.450
We’re ready here. Bye, oldie!

22:34.200 --> 22:39.730
So you ended up in this shithole because of a man, right?

22:40.430 --> 22:43.370
Yes, but let's not talk about it...

22:44.240 --> 22:45.920
I’d rather live the present.

22:58.500 --> 23:02.930
The old women in town say

23:02.930 --> 23:04.920
this house is evil.

23:05.990 --> 23:07.070
Evil?

23:07.070 --> 23:09.480
How can a house be evil?

23:10.120 --> 23:12.120
You’re right.

23:12.120 --> 23:14.610
You know what small towns are like

23:15.050 --> 23:20.530
There are old stories, rumors dating back to when I was a child.

23:21.300 --> 23:23.950
Then rumors kind of escalate and...

23:24.580 --> 23:26.210
What kind of stories?

23:26.470 --> 23:28.740
I do not know, I can't remember.

23:30.040 --> 23:32.370
Some fool had died in here or

23:32.370 --> 23:32.700
Some fool had died in here or
had killed someone, maybe

23:32.700 --> 23:35.200
had killed someone, maybe

23:35.600 --> 23:39.860
They called it “the house of murderers” or something like that

23:40.540 --> 23:42.670
Seems like a lot of murderers

23:43.060 --> 23:45.930
Seems the house draws them

23:47.310 --> 23:49.410
Impressive, isn’t it?

23:57.780 --> 24:00.090
You didn’t know anything about it?

24:00.900 --> 24:04.230
Look, this is the house of a friend of mine

24:04.870 --> 24:08.510
she may be crazy, but she’s not a murderer

24:09.260 --> 24:15.400
Besides, she lives in Chicago and when you were a child she had not even been born!

24:16.610 --> 24:20.770
I had always wondered what it felt like with someone like you

24:21.300 --> 24:23.080
but here, in town

24:24.770 --> 24:27.050
we don’t even have whores

24:28.420 --> 24:29.510
can you imagine?

24:30.440 --> 24:35.300
If you only knew what those boors down there say behind your back

24:35.950 --> 24:39.720
And yet I know most of them would be happy to fuck you

24:40.580 --> 24:45.540
You’re better than any woman in town!

24:46.300 --> 24:49.960
I see that wine makes you garrulous

26:01.570 --> 26:03.770
Why don't you stay here for the night?

26:10.740 --> 26:13.150
Are you married?

26:14.500 --> 26:18.170
No, no family. No, nothing

26:18.850 --> 26:20.310
So, what?

26:21.090 --> 26:24.350
Are you afraid of the old people in town?

26:27.630 --> 26:32.260
You are a bitch, you shuold do it professionally

26:33.110 --> 26:35.550
You could live like a queen here!

26:35.810 --> 26:36.570
What the hell...!

26:47.270 --> 26:50.800
It doesn't end here

27:49.270 --> 27:50.270
Fuck!

28:13.250 --> 28:17.130
Amy listen, you have to come here right now

28:17.610 --> 28:19.010
There's something wrong

28:19.410 --> 28:20.410
Just a moment

28:20.910 --> 28:24.740
Before moving on to Amy, I would like to know something more about this man

28:28.610 --> 28:30.100
He suddenly falls into Erika's life

28:30.910 --> 28:33.260
and then seems to disappear into nothingness

28:34.240 --> 28:36.650
Indeed. But I've never seen him.

28:37.270 --> 28:39.110
The cops asked me too

28:40.790 --> 28:42.230
I think they found traces

28:42.670 --> 28:46.730
Yes, we'll get there later. Well, let's go back to Amy?

28:58.630 --> 29:02.990
It’s weird that you’ve seen strange things here after three days

29:04.440 --> 29:09.030
I would have run away the very first day, even without seeing anything!

31:15.570 --> 31:16.710
Good morning to you!

31:18.010 --> 31:21.790
Looking at your face, I would say you’ve had yet another terrible night

31:22.770 --> 31:24.110
You can say that again

31:25.000 --> 31:27.970
In a way, this place does have its own charm!

31:28.720 --> 31:32.390
It’s a shame that I had no chance to really enjoy it

31:34.050 --> 31:37.550
But I'm lucky to have so many good friends

31:38.660 --> 31:45.320
one gave me this house and the other one has come to save me from the house!

31:48.970 --> 31:51.320
So, won't you tell me what happened?

31:52.890 --> 31:56.860
By the way, you offended me: why didn’t you tell me anything.

31:57.350 --> 31:59.460
I should never forgive you for that, you know?

32:00.110 --> 32:03.070
You’re right... It’s only that sometimes things happen so suddenly.

32:05.070 --> 32:07.560
All right, I'll forgive.

32:09.100 --> 32:11.860
Now, tell me, then maybe the ghosts will disappear

32:13.080 --> 32:18.140
As long as everything was fine, he was able to restrain himself

32:19.850 --> 32:22.780
Then... he started beating me regularly.

32:24.060 --> 32:26.850
I have always told you that he was raving mad!

32:26.850 --> 32:29.180
Besides, he was a security guard...

32:29.940 --> 32:33.900
He started having drinking problems after his father’s death

32:34.330 --> 32:37.610
The more weapons they carry, the weaker they are!

32:38.320 --> 32:40.580
They need a big phallic symbol to compensate!

32:42.080 --> 32:43.950
What happened the night you left him?

32:44.440 --> 32:48.140
Would you believe me if I told you I do not remember anything?

32:48.760 --> 32:51.690
Of course, I understand you prefer to forget about it

32:52.340 --> 32:54.580
No, it’s not that. It’s strange

32:54.700 --> 32:56.550
I have been thinking about it

32:57.080 --> 32:59.550
he was raising his hands once again

33:00.200 --> 33:03.440
I remember the stench of alcohol coming from his mouth

33:04.430 --> 33:08.540
a moment later I was outside, getting into my car

33:09.040 --> 33:12.140
And then I got here. It was

33:12.860 --> 33:15.080
I felt like I was trapped

33:15.690 --> 33:19.680
I accumulated so many dreams, too many

33:20.750 --> 33:23.980
and now I want to start modelling again

33:42.610 --> 33:43.820
Look at this

33:54.830 --> 33:58.030
Do you think it looks like that because of the dust?

34:07.570 --> 34:09.449
And who the fuck is that

34:10.139 --> 34:11.880
it was just you and me

34:15.179 --> 34:16.719
Jesus...!

34:19.780 --> 34:22.409
I didn’t notice that on the camera screen

34:23.820 --> 34:27.520
Are you sure you haven't edited them just to scare me?

34:28.630 --> 34:30.360
I swear I haven't!

34:32.230 --> 34:35.190
Okay, enough with that. I want to get to the bottom of this!

34:35.750 --> 34:36.949
That’s my girl!

34:37.679 --> 34:38.800
Right, but where do we start?

34:39.300 --> 34:43.610
I know what to do. A friend of mine, who is a real geek

34:44.219 --> 34:47.440
can't wait to do some shooting of paranormal activities

34:47.440 --> 34:49.260
instead of wedding ceremonies

34:50.540 --> 34:53.270
ust let me make a couple of phone calls.

35:27.690 --> 35:31.110
Don’t worry, he’s raving mad, but he’s not dangerous!

35:31.760 --> 35:33.140
come in, dear

35:35.460 --> 35:38.540
Is this the first time you’ve been asked to record ghosts?

35:39.380 --> 35:45.510
I’d say so, unless you want me to consider certain guests at wedding ceremonies!

35:59.060 --> 36:02.000
I have watched all the scary movies though

36:02.340 --> 36:05.540
and I know what real ghostbusters do in these cases, you know?

36:06.360 --> 36:07.890
Come here, girls

36:16.670 --> 36:19.480
Have a look at this and tell me what you think about it

36:23.690 --> 36:24.870
Shit!

36:30.170 --> 36:31.300
That’s scary

36:32.270 --> 36:34.890
Is this some kind of technical problem?

36:35.580 --> 36:37.580
If a videocamera did that

36:38.280 --> 36:40.720
teach me how to do recreate that effect

36:42.000 --> 36:43.580
Should I take it as a no?

36:44.700 --> 36:47.000
How can you still stay in the house after that?

36:47.210 --> 36:50.130
Come on, dude, shouldn’t you be reassuring us?

36:52.420 --> 36:58.010
You’re right. It’s just that I'm a hungry, and when I'm hungry...

37:00.270 --> 37:03.320
All right, I got it.

37:15.280 --> 37:16.620
Camera "a"

37:30.980 --> 37:32.680
And what would that be?

37:32.990 --> 37:34.080
A k2

37:34.510 --> 37:36.740
a detector for magnetic fields

37:37.260 --> 37:40.140
specifically made for paranormal investigations

37:40.690 --> 37:42.320
All tv series have it

37:42.860 --> 37:44.580
Do I need to teach you everything?!

37:54.650 --> 37:56.060
When do you enter the story?

37:56.770 --> 37:59.470
Well, just after...

38:03.460 --> 38:04.600
Are you ok?

38:07.350 --> 38:08.800
Do you want us to interrupt?

38:17.010 --> 38:20.820
Yes ... I've a bad headache.

38:23.620 --> 38:26.440
Ok. We resume later. Stop.

38:30.820 --> 38:32.200
So, you are a more comfortable here, isn't it?

38:33.060 --> 38:34.430
Tell me, what happened before?

38:35.020 --> 38:38.490
Nothing ... a headache, I told you. I suffer from it.

38:39.340 --> 38:42.740
Well. So we arrived at your entry into story

38:44.100 --> 38:46.990
Yes. Amy called me because of what happened the night before

39:04.830 --> 39:07.890
I don’t know what that is exactly, but I swear it’s all edible

39:08.540 --> 39:11.120
So, what about the outcome of your investigations?

39:11.900 --> 39:14.240
I still have to watch the shootings carefully

39:14.580 --> 39:18.420
The instruments recorded some peaks, especially in your bedroom

39:19.080 --> 39:22.220
but what impressed me most was the tour of the place

39:23.060 --> 39:25.440
that was really some crazy shit

39:26.680 --> 39:28.020
“the house of the devil”

39:29.500 --> 39:31.060
What kind of a place is this one?

39:31.100 --> 39:33.600
Well, there are a variety of opinions

39:43.720 --> 39:44.960
What the fuck

39:52.520 --> 39:54.210
Can you understand what it says?

39:54.670 --> 39:56.980
Wait, maybe if I...

39:58.840 --> 40:00.050
“Basterd”

40:31.690 --> 40:32.680
Therese...

40:36.360 --> 40:38.650
This place is not peaceful.

40:40.490 --> 40:44.980
There’s... hate... and pain

40:46.280 --> 40:50.250
which have accumulated for a long, long time. And...

40:50.250 --> 40:50.270
which have accumulated for a long, long time. And...
What?

40:50.270 --> 40:51.830
What?

40:53.470 --> 40:58.610
I don’t know. I need more time to understand these feelings I have

41:19.110 --> 41:22.820
There are some ancient ruins nearby, aren’t there?

41:23.350 --> 41:26.720
How do you know that? Have you ever been here?

41:28.700 --> 41:32.580
The ancient places are one of the things I perceive more distinctly.

41:42.850 --> 41:46.320
This place reminds me of my village in the South.

41:46.850 --> 41:49.330
Do you still have all your family there?

41:49.850 --> 41:52.760
And why did you decide to move to “the city”?

41:53.020 --> 41:55.560
I left Sicily because of my gift...

41:55.950 --> 41:59.940
The people of my village treated me like some kind of witch.

42:00.510 --> 42:05.080
The daughter of a witch, and the granddaughter of a witch

42:05.320 --> 42:07.970
And what your “gift” be exactly?

42:08.830 --> 42:10.140
You can imagine

42:10.990 --> 42:14.620
I feel the presence of those who are no longer among us

42:15.770 --> 42:18.690
And... well, sometimes they talk through me

42:19.880 --> 42:21.450
I know it’s hard to believe

42:21.970 --> 42:26.010
I don’t know what to believe since I came into this house!

42:26.370 --> 42:29.370
So, what have you felt inside?

42:31.200 --> 42:34.330
A lot of cruelty, sorrow

42:35.640 --> 42:39.230
and suffering. Also of children

42:41.850 --> 42:44.910
I can still feel their frightened voices

42:46.270 --> 42:47.810
It must be terrible

42:48.050 --> 42:50.030
your gift I mean

42:51.680 --> 42:53.880
Can I ask you how you ended up here?

42:54.740 --> 42:57.810
Love affair with a bad ending

42:58.980 --> 43:01.300
And where is he now?

43:02.050 --> 43:06.130
I really don’t know. I have erased him for good

43:06.710 --> 43:09.940
Over the years, I have learned to do so

43:10.150 --> 43:14.000
in order not to carry the burden over my shoulders, you know

43:16.960 --> 43:20.170
We all wear a mask to survive, don’t we?

43:34.040 --> 43:35.790
And how do you find it here?

43:36.400 --> 43:40.200
I share a room with a female student and I work in a call center

43:41.140 --> 43:43.800
It feels great, like being born again!

43:49.310 --> 43:50.600
What’s up?

43:53.720 --> 43:55.920
Let's get back inside

43:57.550 --> 43:59.310
I feel a little bit dizzy

44:01.110 --> 44:02.930
Therese! What's going on?

44:03.350 --> 44:05.810
Help! Help me, please!

44:11.150 --> 44:12.910
Therese! What are you doing?

44:19.940 --> 44:20.970
What happens?

44:29.370 --> 44:30.120
What happened?

44:30.120 --> 44:31.720
Another headache?

44:32.150 --> 44:38.180
No. I just said it. These things happen to me, they happened to my mother and my grandmother

44:38.940 --> 44:40.140
I can't help it.

44:40.140 --> 44:41.480
Are you a seer?

44:41.550 --> 44:43.260
A medium, I would say

44:43.790 --> 44:47.870
That is, I don't foresee the future or similar things

44:48.560 --> 44:53.250
simply I feel the presences that are always around us

44:53.730 --> 44:55.830
It's like an instinct, that's it

44:57.430 --> 44:59.380
But in that case you didn't just "hear", I think

45:01.720 --> 45:03.900
As you say, you were about to act

45:05.250 --> 45:06.490
you threatened physically, then you had a failure

45:06.490 --> 45:07.920
you threatened physically, then you had a failure
It would be useless

45:07.920 --> 45:08.550
It would be useless

45:08.550 --> 45:11.370
What is it? A kind of possession?
It would be useless

45:11.370 --> 45:12.050
It would be useless

45:12.050 --> 45:13.360
I believe so
It would be useless

45:13.360 --> 45:14.260
It would be useless

45:14.260 --> 45:17.810
A temporary possession by a spirit, not demonic possession
It would be useless

45:17.810 --> 45:19.130
It would be useless

45:19.130 --> 45:21.530
I become a ... sort of channel
It would be useless

45:21.530 --> 45:21.950
It would be useless

45:21.950 --> 45:25.950
And I think it's because of the ancient ruins too
It would be useless

45:25.950 --> 45:27.140
It would be useless

45:27.140 --> 45:28.720
There was something wrong in there.
It would be useless

45:28.720 --> 45:29.830
It would be useless

45:29.830 --> 45:30.900
I see
It would be useless

45:30.900 --> 45:31.980
It would be useless

45:31.980 --> 45:38.840
So if you have been threatening with Erika it means that the spirit that was stalking her had bad intentions?
It would be useless

45:38.840 --> 45:42.320
It would be useless

45:42.320 --> 45:46.140
That voice...it was frightening
It would be useless

45:46.140 --> 45:49.050
It would be useless

45:49.050 --> 45:53.500
I can't believe someone could deliberately change her voice so much
It would be useless

45:53.500 --> 45:55.550
It would be useless

45:55.550 --> 45:57.880
Did it remind you of someone?
It would be useless

45:57.880 --> 45:58.450
It would be useless

45:58.450 --> 46:01.490
Maybe... but I couldn’t really say
It would be useless

46:01.490 --> 46:02.450
It would be useless

46:02.450 --> 46:04.080
Why are you asking me?
It would be useless

46:04.080 --> 46:06.540
It would be useless

46:06.540 --> 46:08.950
I was possessed for a few minutes
It would be useless

46:08.950 --> 46:10.400
It would be useless

46:10.400 --> 46:13.000
Is that the same figure of the picture?
It would be useless

46:13.000 --> 46:13.610
It would be useless

46:13.610 --> 46:14.650
I think so
It would be useless

46:14.650 --> 46:16.080
It would be useless

46:16.080 --> 46:19.260
The same of the room that becomes cold?
It would be useless

46:19.260 --> 46:19.650
It would be useless

46:19.650 --> 46:21.580
I don’t think so
It would be useless

46:21.580 --> 46:21.990
It would be useless

46:21.990 --> 46:24.790
This house is full of entities
It would be useless

46:24.790 --> 46:25.260
It would be useless

46:25.260 --> 46:28.820
And I’ve had different feelings
It would be useless

46:28.820 --> 46:29.940
It would be useless

46:29.940 --> 46:34.730
And who would be this... person or whatever it is?
It would be useless

46:34.730 --> 46:35.250
It would be useless

46:35.250 --> 46:38.330
I don’t think it’s a spirit which is close to you
It would be useless

46:38.330 --> 46:39.020
It would be useless

46:39.020 --> 46:40.920
I believe it’s a parasite
It would be useless

46:40.920 --> 46:41.060
I believe it’s a parasite
an evil spirit
It would be useless

46:41.060 --> 46:42.750
an evil spirit
It would be useless

46:42.750 --> 46:44.670
You mean, dangerous?
It would be useless

46:44.670 --> 46:46.030
It would be useless

46:46.030 --> 46:50.020
Okay. We’ve seen and heard a lot these days
It would be useless

46:50.020 --> 46:50.880
It would be useless

46:50.880 --> 46:52.360
What do we do now?
It would be useless

46:52.360 --> 46:52.610
It would be useless

46:52.610 --> 46:54.500
We have to go back to the origins
It would be useless

46:54.500 --> 46:55.380
It would be useless

46:55.380 --> 47:00.450
we need to understand what these entities are, in order to decide what to do
It would be useless

47:00.450 --> 47:01.450
It would be useless

47:01.450 --> 47:05.950
Tomorrow I'll do some research, on the Internet and at the town hall
It would be useless

47:05.950 --> 47:07.860
It would be useless

47:08.960 --> 47:12.250
ven if you knew every single minute of their lives

47:12.250 --> 47:14.750
now they are different

47:15.090 --> 47:16.640
they are something else

47:17.330 --> 47:19.030
Then you tell us what to do!

47:19.030 --> 47:20.450
A séance

47:20.450 --> 47:24.600
It’s the only way to communicate with the entities without any veil

47:25.520 --> 47:29.560
You mean a... séance? One of those séances?

47:29.790 --> 47:31.510
Therese, are you sure?

47:32.230 --> 47:35.240
I am no expert, but isn’t it dangerous?

47:35.850 --> 47:40.560
Could the spirits completely possess the house and maybe us, once and for all?

47:40.560 --> 47:43.640
I’ve already dealt with this kind of entities

47:44.320 --> 47:48.170
If I can communicate with them without being overwhelmed

47:48.980 --> 47:50.980
I will make them go away.

47:51.560 --> 47:55.900
But listen, I'm not sure I want to do this anymore

47:56.480 --> 47:59.030
I mean, this is not even my place

47:59.740 --> 48:02.020
wouldn’t it be enough to just go aware...

48:02.560 --> 48:06.510
If a parasite nurses a grievance against you

48:06.510 --> 48:09.830
you will take it along with you, wherever you go

48:10.850 --> 48:14.780
They’re not bound to the place, but to the person

48:17.830 --> 48:20.450
If the spirit haunted the person and not the house

48:21.540 --> 48:23.470
it means that Erika was lost, right? Is that what you meant?

48:25.270 --> 48:27.000
No, I didn't say this

48:27.600 --> 48:32.150
One also defends oneself from the spirits, the solution is not always to succumb

48:32.550 --> 48:34.850
But that way ...

48:34.850 --> 48:38.430
sorry, but I think that Erika was very influenced by what you were saying

48:40.450 --> 48:41.630
What do you mean?

48:42.050 --> 48:45.550
What I said. Was Erika scared...?

48:47.650 --> 48:51.120
She had several things to frighten over what I told you

48:51.960 --> 48:56.560
”Apparently the house has collected a series of uninvited guests over the years

48:57.920 --> 49:02.900
people who arrived here accidentally and who then committed violent crimes

49:03.250 --> 49:06.770
or murderers who took shelter here after killing someone

49:07.760 --> 49:09.040
They all died here”

49:11.250 --> 49:15.370
That’s why they call it the house of murderers

49:15.930 --> 49:16.930
Who told you that?

49:17.150 --> 49:18.809
When do we start?

49:20.188 --> 49:21.188
Where are you?

49:22.232 --> 49:23.232
Where are you?

49:23.900 --> 49:25.510
I can’t believe that

49:26.050 --> 49:30.380
Has that little bitch really kept that secret from me?

49:31.680 --> 49:34.690
Her parents were Satan worshippers?

49:35.150 --> 49:37.230
Maybe she doesn’t know anything about that

49:37.230 --> 49:41.450
I don’t think many parents would nonchalantly tell their children

49:42.070 --> 49:43.630
that they’re Satan worshippers!

49:44.190 --> 49:45.900
There’s something I don’t understand though

49:45.900 --> 49:49.080
She says the house has always belonged to her family

49:49.650 --> 49:52.890
but from what you’ve told me, I would say there have been many owners

49:53.420 --> 49:56.910
and it seems it’s been abandoned for more than twenty years!

49:57.589 --> 49:59.254
Hey! I paid money!

49:59.628 --> 50:00.965
Do you understand?

50:12.250 --> 50:13.576
What the hell are you doing?

50:14.850 --> 50:16.278
You bitch...!

50:24.250 --> 50:25.930
Hey, what’s the matter now?

50:27.550 --> 50:29.830
Come on, don’t do that

50:30.350 --> 50:32.990
You’ll see, in a few days everything will be over

50:33.570 --> 50:36.210
You will use this story while flirting with someone!

50:36.550 --> 50:38.340
Nobody will believe me!

50:39.050 --> 50:44.770
Joking aside, I don’t think I’ve ever been frightened by anything in my life

50:45.150 --> 50:46.850
You’re absolutely right

50:47.860 --> 50:50.600
It would have been the perfect scene for a film, right

50:51.530 --> 50:55.010
The medium in a trance, doors slamming

50:55.350 --> 50:58.860
No. That’s not what scares me...

50:59.250 --> 51:02.520
I am scared of myself now.

51:05.250 --> 51:08.690
So someone else leaves the scene. The videomaker

51:09.200 --> 51:13.280
Yes. I don't blame her, everyone has their own way of thinking

51:14.300 --> 51:16.450
She also refused to be interviewed

51:17.350 --> 51:18.900
I can imagine

51:19.560 --> 51:22.050
And then it is known that seances can be dangerous

51:24.650 --> 51:29.600
There was nothing else to do. I was there to help out as I could

51:30.650 --> 51:34.460
In any case I was not new to seances

51:35.670 --> 51:37.680
I knew I could handle them

51:38.850 --> 51:41.370
But the reason why the seances are not recommended

51:41.580 --> 51:45.220
is once again the great power of suggestion, right?

51:47.430 --> 51:52.910
I repeat, everyone is free to think the way he wants

52:59.850 --> 53:01.140
Are you ready?

53:04.920 --> 53:06.280
Let's make a chain

53:10.850 --> 53:15.360
lease don’t break it for any reason whatsoever

53:15.880 --> 53:19.080
or it could be dangerous for me and for all of us

53:19.080 --> 53:20.080
Allright

53:21.200 --> 53:23.660
I just wanted to ask Therese...

53:24.170 --> 53:26.350
why would it be dangerous?

53:26.900 --> 53:30.880
I heard that in a lot of films as well, of course

53:31.230 --> 53:33.350
but this is not a movie...

53:33.400 --> 53:35.690
You would break the flowing of the energy

53:35.690 --> 53:39.350
something could be trapped in this dimension

53:39.650 --> 53:43.660
And it could be dangerous for me too, if I'm in a trance

53:44.550 --> 53:47.560
I'm not sure I completely understand...

53:48.410 --> 53:50.060
Something wrong, Erika?

53:51.160 --> 53:53.460
Let's keep quiet now

54:15.090 --> 54:16.570
Is she in a trance?

54:19.550 --> 54:22.160
Therese? Can you hear me?

54:39.150 --> 54:41.770
I'm cold

54:42.850 --> 54:44.550
I’m so... cold

54:54.850 --> 54:56.970
It’s dark

54:58.450 --> 55:00.330
it’s... cold

55:01.150 --> 55:02.670
I’m... alone

55:04.250 --> 55:08.180
Therese... tell what you can see?

55:19.350 --> 55:22.330
What the fuck are you doing, you bloody whore!

55:22.450 --> 55:24.410
What do you think you’re doing...?

55:28.850 --> 55:30.720
What’s happening, Therese?

55:31.840 --> 55:33.680
Oh my God! Therese!

55:35.850 --> 55:37.520
Therese, are you all right?

55:38.090 --> 55:39.500
Therese, are you all right?

55:39.910 --> 55:41.180
Therese. You scared the...

55:41.180 --> 55:42.100
Oh my God

55:42.410 --> 55:44.590
Hey! What’s your problem?! Why did you break the chain?

55:44.850 --> 55:46.870
I just couldn’t do it

55:47.470 --> 55:49.420
I couldn’t control it!

55:50.070 --> 55:53.690
Don’t you remember what she told us? You could have killed her!

55:54.450 --> 55:56.120
I'm so sorry!

56:00.450 --> 56:06.810
Jenny, I'm not blaming you, I'm just saying that it seems absurd to me

56:07.360 --> 56:11.380
this place is famous for the terrible things that happened here

56:11.380 --> 56:14.990
and you, the owner, hide everything from me

56:16.120 --> 56:19.120
Maybe I shouldn’t have invited you to stay at my place, you know?

56:19.120 --> 56:22.070
I should have known you would create troubles.

56:22.070 --> 56:23.490
What the hell do you mean?

56:23.880 --> 56:25.570
Do you think I'm having fun?

56:25.570 --> 56:26.970
And what do you care?

56:27.260 --> 56:32.660
You’re thousands of miles away from here and you’ve never been interested in this place

56:33.330 --> 56:37.010
I'm sorry... Listen, do what you think is right

56:37.570 --> 56:39.070
but do not get into any trouble, okay?

56:39.710 --> 56:41.940
Anyway, they must have told you a lot of bullshit!

56:42.500 --> 56:45.600
Nothing of what you’ve just said corresponds to the story of my family and my house

56:46.850 --> 56:49.620
That’s what I though. But how can this be?

56:49.850 --> 56:52.610
I don’t know. I really don’t know.

56:53.650 --> 56:56.210
It seems like a fool’s game

56:56.850 --> 56:59.960
I gotta go now... Erika... Take care.

57:01.350 --> 57:02.380
Fuck off!

58:15.650 --> 58:19.870
"Turn right and proceed for ten kilometers to the south-west"

58:22.250 --> 58:25.120
They called it “the house of murderers”

58:25.250 --> 58:30.700
Seems like a lot of murderers. Seems the house draws them

59:07.650 --> 59:09.160
What's happening?... Erika!

59:10.250 --> 59:18.310
Stop! I can't bear it! Stop, please!

59:19.250 --> 59:22.420
Don’t worry, don’t worry. It’s all over now.

59:28.250 --> 59:32.030
So again it seems that you had a strong ascendancy on Erika

59:32.250 --> 59:34.220
Are you insinuating something?

59:34.250 --> 59:36.630
No, just it seems clear to me that...

59:36.630 --> 59:36.720
No, just it seems clear to me that...
Look, if you want to stop the interview here, it's okay to me

59:36.720 --> 59:40.160
Look, if you want to stop the interview here, it's okay to me

59:40.660 --> 59:44.480
You wanted my story of the facts, I didn't think I was under accusation

59:45.280 --> 59:46.940
I'm not accusing you of anything, Therese

59:47.150 --> 59:52.330
The police carried out their investigations and as far as I know there is nothing against me

59:52.700 --> 59:54.040
Let's finish it here, okay?

59:54.350 --> 59:57.480
Do I have to remind you that we paid you in advance?

59:57.850 --> 59:59.720
I do not accept blackmail!

01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:01.850
Ok, ok. Calm down

01:00:01.850 --> 01:00:02.490
Ok, ok. Calm down
I'm putting you under stress

01:00:02.490 --> 01:00:03.400
I'm putting you under stress

01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:04.720
We interrupt

01:00:05.290 --> 01:00:07.210
We'll finish tomorrow, ok? Stop

01:00:10.850 --> 01:00:12.840
Here we are

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:15.140
You look tired today

01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:15.210
You look tired today
I didn't sleep well

01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:16.560
I didn't sleep well

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:17.920
I hope not because of me

01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:20.110
I still apologize for ...

01:00:20.410 --> 01:00:25.070
Do not worry. The important thing is that we get to the end as soon as possible

01:00:25.350 --> 01:00:27.030
There is not much left, I think

01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:30.180
Erika accepts the second seance...

01:01:57.850 --> 01:01:59.660
You’ve killed me!

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:03.010
You’ve killed me!

01:02:08.850 --> 01:02:10.410
you whore!

01:02:51.850 --> 01:02:53.120
Therese, do you feel better?

01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:00.420
What is this?

01:03:02.250 --> 01:03:03.470
Where is Erika?

01:03:04.250 --> 01:03:05.550
She run away

01:03:06.510 --> 01:03:07.790
We have to find her!

01:03:13.350 --> 01:03:14.670
And you didn't find her

01:03:15.370 --> 01:03:16.660
Just vanished

01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:19.760
I see it's painful for you to talk about it

01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:21.530
But we're done

01:03:21.850 --> 01:03:23.210
Yes.

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:26.480
everyone knows the rest

01:03:27.110 --> 01:03:32.110
the police arrived, and they told us they were already looking for Erika

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:35.410
she was suspected of killing her boyfriend

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:37.960
And you? Did you believe it?

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:40.830
At the moment it seemed absurd

01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:45.630
She didn't have the attitude of a person who had just killed someone

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:50.270
I mean, she certainly was not a professional murderer, she killed in a rap

01:03:51.050 --> 01:03:52.540
I don't understand what you mean

01:03:53.450 --> 01:03:58.530
I mean she was not a bandit used to doing crimes and then pretend nothing happened

01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:02.410
he was a person like me and you, even more sensitive

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:07.210
So for you she had like ... removed her crime

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:10.240
she really believed she was innocent

01:04:11.110 --> 01:04:13.810
Yes. Yes there is no other explanation

01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:22.080
But then that name ... The house of murderers, the people of the village given to that place...

01:04:22.530 --> 01:04:24.920
I don't know. I really do not know

01:04:25.550 --> 01:04:30.590
The police reported that the house in the 70s had been the scene of orgiastic rites

01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:33.000
that included sacrifices of children

01:04:34.050 --> 01:04:36.350
I don't know. I really ...

01:04:36.350 --> 01:04:36.610
I don't know. I really ...
So, Therese! You know we went back to you for the powers you say you have

01:04:36.610 --> 01:04:42.210
So, Therese! You know we went back to you for the powers you say you have

01:04:42.550 --> 01:04:44.940
You conducted Erika to make seances

01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:47.110
you told her you hear voices, to see things

01:04:47.110 --> 01:04:50.930
and now you can only tell us "I don't know"?!

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:53.520
What do you want me to say?

01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:59.350
The house attracted murderers for more than a century and brought them to death?

01:05:00.070 --> 01:05:03.020
And so also Erika found the house for the same reason?

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:04.830
She had no escape?

01:05:05.050 --> 01:05:07.770
Yes. This is what I think

01:05:08.890 --> 01:05:13.040
And apparently the blood story of the house dated back to World War II

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:16.550
but I think the Evil of the house is more and more ancient

01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:19.950
it dates back to the ancient riuns

01:05:20.570 --> 01:05:23.440
and someway those riuns are the key

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:30.120
I knew the spirit that infested her would bring her to death

01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:31.580
Are you happy?

01:05:31.950 --> 01:05:35.600
However, there is no trace of Erika's death

01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:40.310
Her footsteps, like those of that man, disappear into air

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:42.800
She's missing, not dead

01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:45.910
I told you what you wanted. That's enough

01:05:46.550 --> 01:05:50.330
Therese! oh... stop!

01:06:41.532 --> 01:06:46.532
