I'm here for the sergeants test.

-Proctors meet downstairs in the library.
-I'm here to take the test.

00:08.967 --> 00:12.220
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
Take one booklet and pass the rest back.

00:12.470 --> 00:16.683
Don't break the seal until I tell you to.
You have three hours to complete the test.

00:16.975 --> 00:18.143
You can begin.

00:20.854 --> 00:23.523
I just wanted you to know
that we've made an arrest,

00:23.690 --> 00:26.276
and it looks like we're gonna be able
to recover most of the money.

00:26.359 --> 00:29.404
-Oh, my God! That's wonderful!
-I... I should be going.

00:29.487 --> 00:31.197
Uh... I... I wanted to give you the news.

00:31.281 --> 00:33.241
Are you sure?
I'll be done in a few minutes.

00:33.324 --> 00:35.160
-I'll be in the way.
-Greg,

00:35.243 --> 00:37.704
I know how hard you worked today, I...

00:38.413 --> 00:40.582
The least I can do is...
is buy you a drink.

00:40.665 --> 00:42.751
Yeah, I guess uh, I could stick around.

The area's pretty deserted at night.
I wouldn't count on there being witnesses.

01:13.823 --> 01:15.450
The guy's watch is gone.

01:15.950 --> 01:18.369
Looks like he wore two rings.
Both of them are gone.

01:18.495 --> 01:19.913
Whatever cash he had is gone.

01:19.996 --> 01:21.831

The guy's name is "Kerry Oaks."

That uniform cop said the car was locked,
so whoever did it was inside the car.

Well, he was an attorney. Uh,
name of the firm's Robinson and Serny.

-The office is located on Madison Avenue.
-What's in the case?

-Entry wound around the rib cage.
-No doubt about it being a robbery?

All the victims were white males,
40, 50 years old, and a gun was used.

to make it a pattern.

in my wardrobe?

It is something of a statement, Medavoy.

It's not a statement.
It's a shirt and a tie.

-I think they're very nice, Greg.
-GREG: Thank you.

-Yeah, what about 'em?
-Uh... They're respectable

from the outside,
but basically, they're hooker bars.

we think might be related.

-Have a seat, doctor.
-(DOOR CLOSING)

07:41.961 --> 07:45.089
I can't provide you with any more detail
than I did at the time.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.385
Uh... You said that the assailant
was "either white or Hispanic."

07:49.469 --> 07:52.889
Uh... "In his 20s or 30s,
medium build, medium height."

07:52.972 --> 07:55.099
And, uh, you weren't sure
what color his hair was.

07:55.766 --> 07:58.144
-I had a concussion.
-Where were you coming from?

07:58.436 --> 07:59.437
Nowhere.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.440
I was out walking.

08:02.565 --> 08:07.653
Now, uh, you live at 975 West 71st Street.

08:07.737 --> 08:11.449
-Is that between Broadway and Columbus?
-Columbus and Central Park West.

08:11.657 --> 08:13.493
And you were robbed
around Greenwich and Warren?

08:13.659 --> 08:15.870
I didn't realize I needed
special dispensation

08:15.953 --> 08:17.246
to leave the upper west side.

08:17.371 --> 08:20.166
Doctor, we're looking into whether or not
there's a pattern of robberies here.

08:20.249 --> 08:22.460
It might help if we knew
where the robbery victims

08:22.543 --> 08:23.669
had been previously.

08:23.753 --> 08:26.506
And what I'm telling you
is where I had been was out walking.

08:26.797 --> 08:28.174
I do what a lot of New Yorkers do.

08:28.257 --> 08:30.092
I look at buildings,
I look at people, I walk.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.678
According to the report,
you weren't entirely cooperative

08:32.762 --> 08:34.847
-at the time.
-I know. I couldn't identify the guy.

08:34.931 --> 08:35.932
I didn't see the point.

08:36.015 --> 08:39.185
Wouldn't ride around in a radio car,
wouldn't look at the mug shots.

08:39.268 --> 08:42.271
-Are you chastising me, Detective?
-I'm trying to understand why.

08:43.064 --> 08:45.483
It was a traumatic episode,
but I survived it.

08:45.650 --> 08:48.444
I lost an inexpensive watch,
about 80 dollars in cash.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.113
Whatever credit cards had been taken
were immediately canceled.

08:51.197 --> 08:53.115
I saw no point
in prolonging the aftermath.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.701
The only point would be
if it led to apprehending the guy.

08:55.826 --> 08:59.747
I didn't see that
as even a remote possibility then.

09:00.456 --> 09:02.667
Now, it's two months later,
and I have no idea why I'm here.

09:03.167 --> 09:06.879
We think the same guy that robbed you
robbed somebody else last night.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.215
This time, he also murdered him.

09:17.348 --> 09:20.476
If I could be of any assistance,
I would be.

09:21.394 --> 09:24.480
This guy killed once.
There's a good chance he'll kill again.

09:25.439 --> 09:28.568
If something occurs to me,
I'll let you know.

09:42.081 --> 09:44.250
What can you tell us
about Kerry Oaks, Mr. Serny?

09:44.625 --> 09:47.128
He cared about his kids,
cared about people.

09:47.753 --> 09:49.589
-Perfect lawyer.
-Married? Divorced?

09:49.714 --> 09:53.259
Divorced. His wife moved with the kids
out to California several years ago.

09:53.509 --> 09:56.387
He'd go out there
many number of times during the year.

09:56.762 --> 09:58.639
Any time we had business in Los Angeles,

09:58.723 --> 10:00.808
if at all possible,
he would be the one to go.

10:00.891 --> 10:02.935
Well, any idea where he was coming from,

10:03.019 --> 10:05.313
or what he was doing in the part of town
where he was found?

10:05.396 --> 10:06.814
I assume he went to dinner down there.

10:06.897 --> 10:09.358
Nah, there aren't really
any restaurants nearby, that's the thing.

10:09.650 --> 10:11.444
But there are a few gay bars down there.

10:11.652 --> 10:14.071
-Well, what does it matter?
-ANDY: If we knew where he was,

10:14.155 --> 10:15.781
it might help us
to find out who killed him.

10:15.865 --> 10:16.907
I don't know where he was.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.784
well, was there anything
out of the ordinary

10:18.868 --> 10:21.203
that you observed during the course
of working with him?

10:21.579 --> 10:23.205
-Like what?
-Was he a heavy drinker?

10:23.289 --> 10:25.666
Did he use drugs?
Did he frequent prostitutes?

10:25.791 --> 10:27.043
I don't get you guys.

10:27.752 --> 10:30.254
This man was an upstanding citizen
who was robbed and murdered.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.299
Are you looking for some reason
to believe that he brought it on himself?

10:33.382 --> 10:35.718
Sir, what we're trying to do is
get a sense of who he was

10:35.801 --> 10:38.179
in the hopes of reconstructing
what took place last night.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.473
When work with someone
for all these years,

10:40.598 --> 10:43.351
you learn to respect
that there are parts of their life

10:43.434 --> 10:44.852
that they wanna remain private.

10:45.019 --> 10:49.065
If you're asking me was Kerry conflicted
about his sexuality, I don't know.

10:49.565 --> 10:51.025
If you had to make a guess.

10:51.275 --> 10:52.902
There was a time I might have
wondered about it,

10:52.985 --> 10:55.446
but I've long since stopped
concerning myself.

10:56.405 --> 10:59.241
He was a wonderful guy.
You ought to find out who did this to him.

10:59.367 --> 11:00.785
Thanks for your time, Mr. Serny.

-Thanks for coming in, Mr. Dayton.

11:17.885 --> 11:20.513
Somebody shoots up my tournament,
I drop what I'm doin'.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.556
-Why don't we go back here?
-MARCUS: Sure.

11:26.018 --> 11:27.144
ANDY: Hey, Rita...

11:28.354 --> 11:30.773
-this guy's a known gambler from way back.
-Big?

11:31.232 --> 11:33.609
He was on his way,
then he took a collar for bookmaking.

11:33.734 --> 11:36.320
Took another one for policy.
Haven't seen him around in a while.

11:36.862 --> 11:37.905
Thanks.

11:43.994 --> 11:46.580
Has there been any recent violence
connected with the tournament?

11:46.706 --> 11:47.581
None.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.208
Nothing that might involve
one of the players?

11:49.625 --> 11:51.877
These are young boys
wantin' to play basketball,

11:52.044 --> 11:54.922
and being given the opportunity to do so
in an organized fashion.

11:55.005 --> 11:57.508
That's why it's such a shame.

11:57.633 --> 12:01.053
How about gangs? Any chance
this is some kind of a turf war?

12:01.137 --> 12:02.596
This ain't got nothin'
to do with no gangs.

12:02.888 --> 12:04.849
Does it have somethin'
to do with gambling?

12:06.267 --> 12:08.728
-You know who Holcomb Rucker is?
-No.

12:08.853 --> 12:10.563
Worked for the parks department.

12:11.480 --> 12:14.775
Started a basketball tournament in Harlem
with his own money,

12:15.151 --> 12:19.196
so young boys up there have somethin'
to do aside from drugs and criminality.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.532
No one's criticizing you
for organizing a basketball tournament.

12:21.615 --> 12:24.493
The Rucker Tournament
is world-famous today.

12:24.744 --> 12:27.288
All the greatest stars from the NBA,
come summertime,

12:27.371 --> 12:31.876
they make it up to 155th Street
to play against the Jackie Jacksons,

12:31.959 --> 12:34.754
the Earl Manigaults,
Holcomb Rucker started it.

12:35.004 --> 12:37.757
Now, I'm looking to do
the same thing in my time he did in his.

12:38.299 --> 12:42.261
And no ex ballplayer cryin' about his lot
in life with a gun is gonna stop me.

12:43.262 --> 12:44.305
Who are we talking about?

12:44.513 --> 12:46.724
I think I'm gonna leave that one
alone for right now.

12:46.807 --> 12:48.559
You're tellin' us
there's someone you suspect,

12:48.642 --> 12:51.061
but you're not gonna give us his name?
What is that?

12:51.604 --> 12:55.274
-I got no hard proof, you understand.
-Give us a name, Mr. Dayton.

12:56.817 --> 13:01.155
Ty Newell, 16 years old.
Could be the next Sebastian Telfair.

13:01.405 --> 13:03.491
He's got an older brother, Stanley.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.660
He don't want to see
Ty get nothin' he didn't have.

13:07.411 --> 13:10.498
If I was you,
he'd be the first place I'd look.

13:23.219 --> 13:26.889
See, I... I think these spread collars
tend to make me look squat.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.599
Come on, Greg.
We don't have a lot of time.

13:28.682 --> 13:30.309
And then,
there's the whole issue with stripes.

13:30.392 --> 13:32.186
And I thought that the vertical stripes

13:32.394 --> 13:35.189
were supposed to make you look taller
and thinner. I... Is that not the case?

13:35.397 --> 13:37.733
I don't know. I...
I never really thought about it.

13:38.359 --> 13:42.530
Look, I don't wanna go to this lunch
thinking I look like a clown, okay?

13:43.781 --> 13:44.824
Okay.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.160
So, what kind of a shirt
am I best off goin' with?

13:48.452 --> 13:51.163
Uh... I don't know.
I'd say solid blue or white.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.624
GREG: Good. (EXHALES) Let's say blue.

13:54.875 --> 13:57.169
Yeah. Now, what about the tie?

13:57.837 --> 14:01.173
(EXHALES) Well, you got a gray suit.
Uh... Go with a nice blue tie.

14:01.882 --> 14:04.510
Oh, good. A nice blue tie. Good.

14:04.718 --> 14:06.679
-This one?
-Yeah, sure. That's good.

14:07.638 --> 14:09.056
You didn't think about it long enough.

14:11.141 --> 14:13.185
-(EXHALES) This one.
-GREG: Good.

14:14.353 --> 14:15.354
Thank you.

14:16.939 --> 14:17.940
(SIGHS)

14:19.066 --> 14:20.609
A pocket square!

14:26.407 --> 14:29.243
You ever go to the school yard
over on Houston and Christy, Stanley?

14:29.410 --> 14:31.203
-Yeah.
-When was the last time?

14:31.912 --> 14:33.414
Two weeks, a month.

14:33.581 --> 14:35.249
Where were you around ten o'clock morning?

14:35.374 --> 14:38.127
Ten o'clock, I was making deliveries.

14:38.294 --> 14:40.170
You know anyone
who has a problem with your brother?

14:40.254 --> 14:41.755
-No.
-LAURA: Anyone have a problem

14:41.839 --> 14:43.132
with the basketball tournament
he's playin' in?

14:43.549 --> 14:46.844
I work two jobs, I have a wife,
and I have a child.

14:46.969 --> 14:50.556
I don't know anything
about any basketball tournaments.

14:50.848 --> 14:53.434
There was a shooting
at the basketball court this morning.

14:53.934 --> 14:56.145
-Oh, yeah?
-You don't know anything about that?

14:56.395 --> 14:58.314
-No, I don't.
-RITA: What's your relationship

14:58.397 --> 15:00.941
-with your brother?
-(CHUCKLES) It's good.

15:01.108 --> 15:03.527
You don't resent his having
this bright future ahead of him?

15:03.777 --> 15:05.279
Why would I resent it?

15:05.404 --> 15:07.406
You were a pretty good ballplayer yourself
at one time.

15:07.656 --> 15:09.033
Not like Ty.

15:09.158 --> 15:11.911
Wound up doin'
an eight and half-year bit in Green Haven.

15:12.036 --> 15:14.747
Yeah. I made some stupid mistakes.

15:15.789 --> 15:17.374
What's your relationship
with Marcus Dayton?

15:17.917 --> 15:19.877
I don't have no relationship
with Marcus Dayton.

15:20.294 --> 15:22.588
-Your brother does, though.
-That's right, my brother does.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.048
That cause any problems?

15:25.716 --> 15:27.718
-We'll see.
-What's that mean?

15:28.260 --> 15:32.056
It means Marcus Dayton
is out for Marcus Dayton.

15:32.222 --> 15:35.100
He gets his hooks in my brother,
I don't know where that goes.

15:35.684 --> 15:37.853
The shooting have anything
to do with Marcus?

15:37.978 --> 15:41.440
All I know
is it had nothing to do with me.

15:56.372 --> 15:57.373
Hey.

15:58.123 --> 16:00.542
Uh... Slugs from the school yard
are from a .357 Magnum.

16:00.876 --> 16:02.920
Uh... They match ones recovered
three years ago at a robbery.

16:03.128 --> 16:05.881
-They make an arrest?
-Yeah, but the gun was never recovered.

16:06.006 --> 16:09.593
-Who's the collar?
-Uh... His name's, uh, "Lucas Benchley."

16:09.718 --> 16:12.429
His last known address
is 1440 Grand Concourse.

16:13.097 --> 16:14.723
-Thanks, Baldwin.
-You got it.

16:20.229 --> 16:21.689
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

16:21.939 --> 16:24.316
-Food here is good.
-Food is good.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.986
I guess you know restaurants.

16:27.403 --> 16:28.988
-I know a few.
-(GREG CHUCKLING)

16:29.279 --> 16:31.407
Yeah, your... your line of work, uh,

16:31.490 --> 16:34.785
wining and dining clients, uh,
is a big part of it.

16:35.411 --> 16:37.663
Most of what I do with clients
is show them apartments.

16:37.746 --> 16:40.290
If they like them, they buy it.
If they don't, they don't.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.793
I have to believe
you're a big part of that, though.

16:43.085 --> 16:45.254
The way you look, the way you dress.

16:45.963 --> 16:48.924
Speaking personally, uh,
I would put a lot of faith

16:49.008 --> 16:53.262
-in what you have to say about things.
-Most people shopping for a home,

16:53.804 --> 16:56.306
looking to spend the kind
of money these places cost...

16:57.307 --> 16:59.601
like to, at least,
think they know what they're looking for.

16:59.685 --> 17:02.396
Hmm. (EXHALES)

17:03.147 --> 17:06.400
At some point, uh,
I may be in the market myself.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.027
BRIGID: Really?

17:08.152 --> 17:11.238
GREG: Long Island was good
for raising kids, but, uh, at this point,

17:11.321 --> 17:12.823
I think I'd prefer being in town.

17:13.490 --> 17:16.493
-Have you thought about what section?
-I don't know, uh,

17:16.577 --> 17:19.455
Battery Park City's on the river.
So, that's nice.

17:19.663 --> 17:23.208
Uh... I also like
the area around lower Fifth.

17:23.751 --> 17:26.378
There's some beautiful buildings
on lower Fifth.

17:26.503 --> 17:30.174
Yeah. I... if you find something
interesting, uh,

17:30.299 --> 17:33.218
-maybe you could show it to me.
-I'd be happy to.

17:34.511 --> 17:36.638
I'm sorry, sir, your card's been declined.

17:39.725 --> 17:42.686
-Put it through again.
-I put it through several times.

17:42.978 --> 17:45.856
-Is there another card you'd like to use?
-GREG: Uh... Actually, uh,

17:45.939 --> 17:48.317
that's the only one
I brought with me, uh...

17:49.276 --> 17:51.236
Why don't I put this on my card?

17:52.905 --> 17:53.906
Thank you.

17:56.784 --> 17:59.620
(EXHALES) Someone at my bank
is gonna hear about this!

17:59.703 --> 18:01.580
It happens all the time.

18:07.836 --> 18:09.797
-(CELL PHONE RINGS)
-(SIGHS) Oh, sorry. Sorry.

18:09.880 --> 18:10.923
(BEEPS)

18:11.006 --> 18:13.217
How's the outside world
treatin' you, Lucas?

18:13.675 --> 18:15.260
(SIGHS) Real good.

18:15.636 --> 18:17.554
You staying out
of the armed-robbery business?

18:17.721 --> 18:19.681
Something happen you're looking
to make me attributable to?

18:19.932 --> 18:21.683
-Asking the question.
-(SCOFFS)

18:21.934 --> 18:24.061
The business back then
was youthfulness and foolishness.

18:24.144 --> 18:26.271
I got a whole different program
goin' on today.

18:26.355 --> 18:29.191
-What program's that?
-I got a Hip-hop DJ business, you know?

18:29.316 --> 18:31.819
Provide entertainment for private parties,
corporate functions. You name it.

18:31.902 --> 18:34.530
-Where were you this morning?
-Okay. Uh...

18:34.613 --> 18:36.824
This mornin',
I met with Mr. And Mrs. Alan Birnbaum

18:36.907 --> 18:39.159
and their daughter, Mindy,
about making plans for her Bat Mitzvah.

18:39.326 --> 18:40.536
LAURA: What time was that?

18:41.286 --> 18:43.914
I was at their apartment
on East 72nd Street

18:43.997 --> 18:46.708
at 9:30 on the dot. And I stayed there
about an hour and a half.

18:46.834 --> 18:49.419
Been down to the school yard
on Houston and Christy recently?

18:49.503 --> 18:52.172
-I don't even know where that is.
-Somebody shot it up this morning.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.050
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You think that somebody was me?

18:55.134 --> 18:57.636
Slugs came back matching the slugs
from when you took down that bodega.

18:57.719 --> 19:00.139
-Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute...
-Since we never recovered the gun,

19:00.305 --> 19:02.099
-we have to assume you still have it.
-That ain't the case, ma'am.

19:02.516 --> 19:04.518
-What'd you do with it?
-I sold it.

19:05.269 --> 19:09.189
The gun, my drugs,
anything that was a part of my thug life,

19:09.314 --> 19:10.941
my slave life...

19:11.942 --> 19:13.402
I expelled it from my being.

19:13.569 --> 19:16.155
-When did you do that?
-As soon as I got out of prison.

19:16.363 --> 19:18.073
Who'd you sell the gun to?

19:18.448 --> 19:21.326
-It's not gonna get back to nobody, is it?
-We'll do our best.

19:23.078 --> 19:25.122
-It was a guy named Pee Wee.
-Who's that?

19:25.539 --> 19:27.624
-A mongrel dude.
-What's his real name?

19:27.958 --> 19:29.960
-Benny Jenkins.
-LAURA: Where can we find him?

19:30.043 --> 19:31.795
Last I heard, he was over
by Mott Haven projects.

19:31.879 --> 19:34.006
-You gonna take me down for this?
-Not if your story checks out.

19:34.089 --> 19:35.549
-Until we know that...
-(CELL PHONE RINGING)

19:35.632 --> 19:37.593
-...You're gonna have to stay here.
-Sorry. I'm sorry.

19:38.343 --> 19:41.555
-(SCOFFS) Another Bat Mitzvah. Damn.
-(CELL PHONE THUDS)

19:44.766 --> 19:46.018
JOHN JR.: Okay. All right, got it.

19:46.143 --> 19:47.811
-Mm-hmm.
-We're running down the gunline.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.104
-Some guy in the Bronx.
-Right.

19:49.479 --> 19:52.316
Thanks. Yeah, crime scene
got a hit on a print off the car.

19:52.774 --> 19:55.444
Comes back to a guy named Kyle Tanner,
did 18 months for a robbery

19:55.527 --> 19:56.653
when he was 19 years old.

19:56.778 --> 19:58.822
-Address?
-JOHN JR: Yeah, on East 25th Street.

19:58.906 --> 20:00.073
Let's go.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.052
Whoa! Hey!

20:20.427 --> 20:21.678
-Pee Wee!
-Hey, I'm moving it.

20:21.803 --> 20:23.805
Stay where you are.
Let me see your hands.

20:24.014 --> 20:25.015
Step out of the truck.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.684
-Man, what I do?
-Keep your hands up.

20:27.768 --> 20:29.144
All right, all right.

20:29.269 --> 20:31.396
-You got any guns in there, Pee Wee?
-No, I ain't got no guns.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.982
Yeah? We search the back of this truck,
we're not gonna find any?

20:34.107 --> 20:36.985
Man, I ain't give you no probable cause
to be searching the back of this truck.

20:37.277 --> 20:38.779
You got a bill of sale
for that sheet metal?

20:38.904 --> 20:42.324
-Man, why you wanna torment me like this?
-Where were you this morning, Pee Wee?

20:43.033 --> 20:44.368
I walked my dog.

20:44.701 --> 20:46.787
Then I went to see my mother
at the nursing home.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.914
I played a game of dominoes
at the nursing home.

20:48.997 --> 20:51.708
I came over here to meet a guy
who wanna buy some of this here scrap.

20:51.792 --> 20:54.711
-LAURA: What guy?
-A guy from Barbados.

20:54.795 --> 20:57.047
Probably got scared off
seein' the two of y'all.

20:57.339 --> 20:58.465
Here's the thing, Pee Wee.

20:58.548 --> 21:00.926
We got information you bought
a gun that was used in a crime.

21:01.218 --> 21:03.845
If you didn't do the crime, maybe you sold
that gun to someone who did.

21:04.137 --> 21:07.099
Either you tell us who that was,
or we're gonna place you under arrest,

21:07.182 --> 21:09.643
impound your truck,
and have Animal Control take your dog.

21:12.771 --> 21:15.148
A kid came by sayin'
he wants to buy a gun.

21:16.858 --> 21:19.486
-Saying somebody I know sent him.
-Who's the kid?

21:21.196 --> 21:22.781
-The kid's named Tyler.
-LAURA: Who sent him?

21:22.864 --> 21:25.200
-Man, I gotta give that up too?
-That's right.

21:30.289 --> 21:33.041
-Marcus Dayton.
-If he finds out I give him up,

21:33.208 --> 21:35.294
this truck better make it
to South America.

21:42.301 --> 21:45.595
-Where were you last night, Kyle?
-I rented a movie.

21:46.179 --> 21:47.347
What did you see?

21:48.098 --> 21:49.933
Uh... <i>13 Going on 30.</i>

21:50.559 --> 21:53.145
More or less a chick flick,
but I have a thing for Jennifer Garner.

21:53.228 --> 21:54.271
so that's why.

21:54.354 --> 21:55.564
-Anybody with you?
-No, sir.

21:55.981 --> 21:59.359
Never in the vicinity of, uh, Greenwich,
south of Chambers?

21:59.568 --> 22:00.694
Not at all.

22:00.944 --> 22:03.363
Uh, the reason we ask is that,
uh, your prints

22:03.447 --> 22:06.783
-turned up on a car in that area.
-Well, I don't know how that would be.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.786
Maybe nothing more than you were just
walking by, you lost your balance,

22:09.870 --> 22:11.455
put your hand on the car,
so you wouldn't fall.

22:11.621 --> 22:13.123
No, only I wasn't walking by.

22:13.665 --> 22:15.584
You used to like stealin'
from kids, right?

22:15.709 --> 22:17.044
But I was a coward.

22:17.377 --> 22:19.087
Right, kids were the only ones
I wasn't afraid of.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.173
-How about now?
-I'm still a coward.

22:22.007 --> 22:24.968
-How you been supporting yourself?
-Full-time student.

22:25.927 --> 22:27.679
I was thinking I might like
to go into finance.

22:29.723 --> 22:31.433
Mind if we take a look
around your apartment?

22:31.516 --> 22:33.352
-Why do you wanna do that?
-Oh, just to rule you out

22:33.435 --> 22:34.811
from any involvement in this car thing.

22:34.936 --> 22:36.730
Yeah, what kind of a car thing
are we talkin' about?

22:37.022 --> 22:38.023
A guy was robbed.

22:39.358 --> 22:42.069
I don't know what to tell you.
I don't do that kinda thing.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.363
-You got a gun you don't want us to find?
-KYLE: No.

22:44.446 --> 22:45.572
So, what are you so afraid of?

22:45.739 --> 22:48.533
Wha... what happens if one of my friends
had a buprenorphine dropped

22:48.617 --> 22:51.495
out of his pocket? You find it behind
one of the couch cushions. What then?

22:51.578 --> 22:54.247
-I get busted?
-We're lookin' for a gun. That's it.

22:54.331 --> 22:56.583
Anything else, it's our little secret.

22:58.877 --> 23:00.420
KYLE: What happens if I say no?

23:01.046 --> 23:04.049
Then I pick up the phone.
I have someone in the DA's office

23:04.132 --> 23:06.009
get a judge to issue a warrant.

23:06.134 --> 23:09.638
If we have to go that route, though,
any inadvertent substances we find

23:09.721 --> 23:12.474
have to go in the report,
and you take your chances.

23:15.644 --> 23:18.480
If you want to look through my apartment,
look through my apartment.

23:18.563 --> 23:19.773
I got nothin' to hide.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.542
KYLE: What's that you're looking for?

23:39.376 --> 23:41.670
-We told you, a gun.
-You're not gonna find that.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.964
Well, alternatively,
proceeds from a robbery.

23:44.089 --> 23:47.134
-What kind of proceeds?
-We hit pay dirt, we'll let you know.

23:47.426 --> 23:50.178
Just for the sake of argument,
let's say you found something.

23:50.262 --> 23:52.472
-You... you don't have a warrant.
-JOHN JR: I don't need a warrant.

23:52.556 --> 23:55.600
-You consented to the search.
-I did? I don't remember doing that.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.060
You signed a piece of paper.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.105
What's to stop me from saying
I was under duress?

24:00.355 --> 24:02.190
The testimony of two police officers.

24:02.274 --> 24:04.901
So, it really just comes down
to an issue of credibility.

24:04.985 --> 24:05.986
Right.

24:07.779 --> 24:08.947
KYLE: Are you hungry?

24:09.406 --> 24:11.491
What, you... you're searching my food now?

24:11.825 --> 24:12.951
You do a lot of cooking?

24:13.326 --> 24:16.538
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I do.
And I don't like people handlin' my food.

24:16.705 --> 24:19.374
Would you just not touch that
with your hands, please?

24:30.010 --> 24:31.595
-(EXHALES)
-(DRAWER CLOSING)

24:34.723 --> 24:36.975
Are these credit cards
for when you don't feel like cookin'?

24:37.434 --> 24:39.060
I found those on the street.

24:39.144 --> 24:41.646
This building gets a lot of break-ins.
I was just keeping them out of sight

24:41.730 --> 24:43.398
until I get a chance to turn 'em in.

24:43.523 --> 24:45.609
JOHN JR: Stand up. Let's go!

24:47.027 --> 24:48.778
-(HANDCUFFS CLATTERING)
-Turn.

24:48.862 --> 24:51.448
KYLE: Believe me or don't believe me,
that's why they're there.

25:00.499 --> 25:04.127
-Who did you give the gun to, Ty?
-I don't have no gun.

25:04.211 --> 25:05.670
-You had one, though.
-Nope.

25:05.962 --> 25:07.714
You have a lot to lose here, Tyler.

25:07.797 --> 25:09.966
From what we understand,
you have a bright future ahead of you.

25:10.050 --> 25:12.344
Now, if you bought an illegal gun
and put it in the hands of somebody

25:12.427 --> 25:14.971
who did something stupid,
you need to tell us the truth about it.

25:15.639 --> 25:18.016
-Did you buy a gun, Tyler?
-(SIGHS)

25:18.266 --> 25:20.310
-Yeah.
-LAURA: What kinda gun was it?

25:20.936 --> 25:23.563
-A .357 Magnum.
-Where's that gun now?

25:23.772 --> 25:26.775
-Hid away in my room.
-Who else lives there with you, Ty?

25:26.858 --> 25:29.110
-Just my grandma.
-What do you need a gun for?

25:29.194 --> 25:31.821
-Just to have one.
-"Just to have one" for what?

25:31.905 --> 25:34.658
Everybody else had one.
I just wanted to have one too.

25:36.284 --> 25:39.454
Did somebody used that gun
to shoot up the school yard this morning?

25:39.663 --> 25:41.957
Now, unless you can give us
a good explanation for how that happened,

25:42.082 --> 25:44.042
we've no choice, but to lock you up.

25:50.465 --> 25:52.384
That had to be my brother, Stanley.

25:54.302 --> 25:55.470
Why do you say that?

25:56.096 --> 25:58.056
My grandma found it and give it to him.

25:58.139 --> 26:00.058
-How do you know that?
-He told me.

26:01.309 --> 26:05.355
Started in how I'm messing up,
how he all disappointed and concerned.

26:05.605 --> 26:07.899
Got hisself locked up when I needed him.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.611
Gets out, he still ain't around.

26:11.736 --> 26:13.947
When he told you he had the gun,
what did you say?

26:14.030 --> 26:17.284
I said, "Give it back, son.
That sucker don't belong to you."

26:19.077 --> 26:20.912
He got getting mad at me then.

26:21.121 --> 26:24.374
Grabbed me, smacked me,
yellin' at me like he was my father.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.043
Only he knew he wasn't getting to me.

26:27.168 --> 26:29.754
He knew it didn't mean nothing
to me what he thought.

26:33.341 --> 26:36.052
Is this why he came by today
tryin' to kill me?

26:39.764 --> 26:41.224
He belong in prison.

26:42.017 --> 26:43.018
(SIGHS)

26:44.686 --> 26:46.396
-(CLEARS THROAT)
-What I want to know is

26:46.605 --> 26:48.898
why my credit card was refused.

26:49.399 --> 26:51.359
Yes, there was activity on it
this morning.

26:51.443 --> 26:55.238
Yes, there were purchases made
at Portofino Men's Clothier.

26:55.363 --> 26:58.742
Listen to me. I pay my bills on time.

26:58.867 --> 27:01.369
I expect that card to be honored
when I use it.

27:01.494 --> 27:04.414
If it's not, I will be forced
to go with the competition.

27:05.206 --> 27:07.250
Do I have your personal assurance of that?

27:07.417 --> 27:09.586
Thank you very much.
I appreciate your help.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.255
Can I talk to the detectives, please?

27:12.339 --> 27:14.716
(EXHALES) We'll be right with you, Doctor.

27:16.551 --> 27:18.762
-This guy, Tanner, looks good.
-What do you have?

27:18.970 --> 27:20.722
A print on the car,
and we found this stack

27:20.847 --> 27:22.098
of credit cards in his apartment.

27:22.182 --> 27:25.185
The dentist we talked to on the chance
it was a pattern came back in.

27:25.352 --> 27:27.103
Swore he couldn't make
a positive ID before.

27:27.187 --> 27:29.939
-See what he says now.
-Let me know.

27:36.780 --> 27:37.781
(DOOR CLOSING)

27:39.324 --> 27:41.618
I have a good dental practice.

27:42.702 --> 27:46.748
I have elderly parents.
I have a wife and two kids.

27:47.666 --> 27:51.670
I'm not ready for certain facts
about my life to become known.

27:51.753 --> 27:54.964
We try very hard
not to betray confidences, Doctor.

27:55.173 --> 27:58.593
-Sometimes you have no choice, though.
-We have a predator here.

27:58.677 --> 28:01.054
There are a great many predators
in the world.

28:01.346 --> 28:04.974
-This one just killed somebody.
-Yes, Detective, I know that.

28:05.058 --> 28:07.102
It's why I'm here.
It's why I've come back,

28:07.268 --> 28:08.645
even though more than anything,

28:08.728 --> 28:11.815
I would like not to be
involved with any of this.

28:12.023 --> 28:14.150
What can you tell us
About the guy who robbed you?

28:14.401 --> 28:16.695
He was young, he was attractive.

28:18.780 --> 28:21.700
I met him at a bar named Randolph's...

28:22.784 --> 28:26.162
-where people like me go.
-What happened after you met him?

28:26.830 --> 28:28.373
We talked, we flirted.

28:29.290 --> 28:32.001
After a while, he asked
if there was somewhere we could go.

28:33.336 --> 28:36.047
I had my car parked nearby,
so we went there.

28:36.214 --> 28:38.133
I remember after he got in,
I looked at him

28:38.216 --> 28:40.343
with the streetlight
coming through the windshield.

28:40.510 --> 28:41.553
He smiled...

28:43.054 --> 28:46.516
then he took out a gun
and beat me until I passed out.

28:47.225 --> 28:49.310
Could you identify him
if you saw him again?

28:50.019 --> 28:51.271
-Yes.
-ANDY: Would you be willing

28:51.396 --> 28:52.939
to pick him out of a lineup?

28:53.565 --> 28:56.025
Yes. Would I have to testify in court?

28:56.276 --> 28:58.820
If we get him to confess,
chances are we won't need you to.

28:59.362 --> 29:01.489
Obviously, I'd be grateful
if I didn't have to.

29:03.658 --> 29:05.702
But I'll do whatever you need me to do.

29:15.628 --> 29:17.130
See anyone you recognize, Dr. Fain?

29:18.548 --> 29:23.011
-(SIGHS) I recognize number three.
-ANDY: Where do you recognize him from?

29:24.429 --> 29:29.100
I recognize him as the person that beat me
and robbed me on October 2nd, 2004.

29:29.184 --> 29:30.310
ANDY: Where did that take place?

29:30.393 --> 29:33.480
In my car, which was parked
down the block from Randolph's tavern.

29:39.027 --> 29:41.821
Well, you got two choices, Stanley.

29:42.322 --> 29:45.366
Either admit it was you with the gun,
or we lean on your grandmother

29:45.450 --> 29:46.659
till she admits givin' it to you.

29:46.743 --> 29:48.536
STANLEY: How much leaning
did you do on my brother?

29:49.162 --> 29:50.371
-(DOOR CLOSING)
-Not much I bet.

29:50.455 --> 29:52.832
Some people get a little pissy
when you try to kill 'em.

29:52.999 --> 29:55.710
-You recover six bullets altogether?
-Why?

29:55.835 --> 29:58.505
Those bullets went
exactly where I aimed them.

29:58.713 --> 30:01.883
-If I wanted to kill him, he'd be dead.
-Then what was the point?

30:01.966 --> 30:04.719
What's the difference? It ain't gonna make
no sense to you what I say, anyway.

30:04.844 --> 30:06.805
-Try us.
-(STANLEY SIGHS)

30:09.057 --> 30:11.267
I couldn't stand to see him do what I did.

30:12.143 --> 30:15.939
-You went to prison for selling drugs.
-I didn't get there all at once.

30:16.523 --> 30:19.859
All right, when I was 16, I was
the star two guard for my high school.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.862
I had all kind of people
wantin' to know me.

30:23.071 --> 30:28.326
Coaches coming from Duke, North Carolina,
Marquette, Syracuse, Kentucky.

30:28.451 --> 30:31.329
-I could've played for any of 'em.
-Why didn't you?

30:32.205 --> 30:34.666
'Cause I went
for the short-end money instead.

30:35.291 --> 30:37.460
I fell for the empty promises,

30:37.585 --> 30:42.423
the quick trim that whatever big shot
it was back then offered me.

30:42.924 --> 30:44.884
Same as my brother
working for Marcus Dayton,

30:45.051 --> 30:46.845
shaving points, or throwing games.

30:46.970 --> 30:49.931
I was working for him
until he didn't need me no more.

30:50.014 --> 30:52.350
And by then,
it was too late to go to college.

30:52.559 --> 30:54.894
I wasn't near able to turn professional.

30:56.229 --> 30:57.480
Where's the gun now?

30:57.564 --> 31:00.316
You never see it coming.
You... you... you... you're 16.

31:00.400 --> 31:03.152
You got a quicker first step
than anybody on the court.

31:03.486 --> 31:05.363
Ain't nothing gonna ever go wrong.

31:06.948 --> 31:12.412
And I needed him to know that it does.
If you ain't careful, it goes way wrong.

31:13.246 --> 31:16.332
-Where's the gun, Stanley?
-I threw it in the river.

31:34.017 --> 31:35.894
We just talked to your brother, Ty.

31:36.185 --> 31:38.021
It might be good
if you hear what he has to say.

31:38.187 --> 31:39.480
How come he ain't locked up?

31:39.647 --> 31:41.566
-That's what you want?
-Yeah, that's what I want!

31:42.317 --> 31:44.569
We think your brother
was just trying to scare you this morning.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.905
You allowed to scare somebody
by shooting a gun at him?

31:47.488 --> 31:49.324
-No.
-TYLER: Then lock him up.

31:49.532 --> 31:50.950
He had reason to be concerned.

31:51.159 --> 31:53.453
Yeah, 'cause I'mma wind up
with an NBA contract,

31:53.578 --> 31:54.996
have my name in the newspapers,

31:55.079 --> 31:58.207
and he's gon' be driving that nasty,
old car with blankets on the seats.

31:58.291 --> 31:59.792
And that's why he be concerned.

32:00.043 --> 32:01.878
You think I don't wanna see
good things for you?

32:01.961 --> 32:04.297
-That's right.
-The one thing that kept me

32:04.380 --> 32:06.799
from messin' up in prison was you.

32:07.342 --> 32:08.760
-Yeah, sure.
-STANLEY: It's true.

32:09.010 --> 32:11.429
I had people keeping an eye on you
you never knew about.

32:11.721 --> 32:13.556
I heard all about what you was doing.

32:14.015 --> 32:15.350
Yeah, and that makes up for everything?

32:15.475 --> 32:17.060
-I'm not saying that...
-TYLER: Help out grandma

32:17.143 --> 32:18.019
with a few dollars.

32:18.227 --> 32:19.979
You don't need to see me,
but once in a while.

32:20.563 --> 32:22.398
I got family to take care of, Ty.

32:22.482 --> 32:24.567

-You are.

-Maybe not.
-But there ain't nothin' behind it, bro.

Ain't nothing but words.

-You're right.
-Why is that?

33:59.579 --> 34:01.664
Well, it's one thing to be
in a police station

34:01.748 --> 34:03.666
and say
who you think did something to you,

34:03.750 --> 34:05.752
and it's another thing
to do it in open court.

Men with families, and jobs, and lives
that they didn't want disrupted.

They were willin' to walk away
from being robbed and beaten,

34:34.822 --> 34:38.034
and not pursue it, rather than have it
come out what they were doin'.

about fags, Detective? (GRUNTS) Hey!

34:42.246 --> 34:43.956

about those robberies, Kyle.

about what happened last night.

-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Don't say it.

34:49.212 --> 34:51.839
-I don't know what you're talking...
-Don't you say it! Because every time

34:51.923 --> 34:53.800
you say somethin'
that's not true, you're gonna get hit.

34:53.883 --> 34:56.094
You just wanna think about
what you're gonna say before you say it.

34:56.177 --> 34:58.221
-That's all.
-I didn't rob anybody. (GROANS)

34:58.304 --> 35:00.640
-Stop hitting me!
-Stop? I just got started.

35:00.765 --> 35:03.559
You... you're not allowed to do that!
Who's gonna know?

35:03.643 --> 35:05.686
He can do it without leavin' a mark.
It's amazing.

35:05.770 --> 35:07.772
You want me to tell you
that I robbed somebody when I didn't?

35:07.855 --> 35:10.274
-I want you to tell me the truth!
-The truth...

35:11.025 --> 35:12.527
Think about it now.

35:14.695 --> 35:16.572
Okay, I robbed a couple of guys.

35:16.697 --> 35:19.367
-What happened last night?
-Nothing. (GROANS)

35:20.034 --> 35:23.287
Before you force somebody that you robbed
to go on the witness stand,

35:23.412 --> 35:25.957
I will send you straight
from here to the emergency room.

35:26.165 --> 35:28.876
-Do you understand me?
-Please don't let him hit me!

35:28.960 --> 35:31.212
Kyle, the only thing on this earth
that's gonna stop him

35:31.295 --> 35:33.214
from hitting you is you tellin' the truth.

35:35.925 --> 35:38.678
-He went nuts!
-This was when you were robbin' him?

35:38.928 --> 35:42.181
He started yellin' that he didn't care,
that it didn't matter anymore,

35:42.306 --> 35:44.225
that he already lost his wife and kids.

35:44.308 --> 35:46.811
And he... it didn't matter,
whatever happened happened.

35:46.894 --> 35:49.105
But he wasn't gonna take it
like some sad, old queen.

35:49.230 --> 35:51.524
-So, you shot him?
-I didn't have a choice.

35:53.609 --> 35:54.652
He was bigger than me.

35:54.819 --> 35:57.071
-Say you shot him, Kyle, say it.
-I shot him!

35:57.822 --> 35:59.448
It was his own damn fault.

36:00.908 --> 36:02.076
Now, write it down.

36:11.043 --> 36:13.379
Got one for the robberies
and the homicide.

36:13.754 --> 36:16.424
-He's finishin' up the statement now.
-Good work.

36:20.845 --> 36:22.638
This turned up in his apartment.

36:28.477 --> 36:32.231
Guy like this, there's a good chance
that he was dealin' in stolen credit cards

36:32.315 --> 36:34.108
from who knows how many sources.

36:37.403 --> 36:38.404

LORI: Detective Ortiz.

36:57.590 --> 36:59.133
-Well...
-RITA: Thanks for comin' by.

36:59.592 --> 37:01.844
We're hoping
you can let it go with Stanley.

37:02.637 --> 37:06.015
(SIGHS) My boss gets a little funny
about firing guns in playgrounds.

37:06.140 --> 37:08.267
Not that he showed
the best judgment in the world,

37:08.351 --> 37:10.519
but I think he was careful
to see no one got hurt,

37:10.603 --> 37:12.605
and I think he did it out of desperation.

37:13.940 --> 37:16.525
-What do you think, Lieutenant?
-What are we talking about?

37:16.609 --> 37:18.152
Letting it go with Stanley Newell.

37:18.236 --> 37:21.197
It's reckless endangerment,
but with his priors, it could be bad.

37:21.405 --> 37:23.866
-What's the situation on the paperwork?
-Are we tied to anything?

37:23.991 --> 37:26.786
-Not yet.
-Well, why don't you guys work it out?

37:30.164 --> 37:31.832
-We'll get you what you need.

37:35.670 --> 37:37.797

37:39.298 --> 37:41.092
(SIGHS) That's just great.

37:41.717 --> 37:44.303
Did you at least try
and get out of it? Okay.

37:45.304 --> 37:46.305
I understand.

37:47.181 --> 37:48.182
(SIGHS)

37:51.769 --> 37:52.770
Hey.

37:55.481 --> 37:57.650
-Good job on that homicide.
-Thanks.

37:58.693 --> 38:00.569

who works for the state department.

38:02.947 --> 38:03.948
All right.

38:04.031 --> 38:06.659
I'm supposed to be going to this dinner
tonight honoring Judge Lasak,

38:06.742 --> 38:08.494
my date just got called back
to Washington.

38:09.120 --> 38:11.330
-This a command performance?
-LORI: Most definitely.

38:11.831 --> 38:13.541
I used to clerk for him.

38:14.041 --> 38:15.835
If the judge sees me there unescorted,

38:15.918 --> 38:18.796
I just know he's gonna have his mitts
all over me.

38:18.879 --> 38:20.589
They don't call him
"Learned hand" for nothing.

38:20.673 --> 38:21.674
(CHUCKLES)

38:23.175 --> 38:26.554
All right, if you got nobody else,
I do come with a clean shirt and tie.

38:27.930 --> 38:30.599
-I can't ask you to do that.
-I volunteered.

38:33.144 --> 38:35.980
Well, if you're serious,
I think I'm gonna take you up on it.

38:37.189 --> 38:38.190
What time?

38:38.524 --> 38:41.193
-Could you pick me up at 6:30?
-Be my pleasure.

38:53.748 --> 38:55.750
Uh... Andy, something's come up.

38:56.083 --> 38:57.877
Would you be able to knock out
the fives for today?

38:57.960 --> 38:59.211
You got a social engagement?

39:00.171 --> 39:01.839
Hey, she asked me to do her a favor.

39:02.631 --> 39:04.175
-Sure.
-Thanks.

39:16.687 --> 39:19.148
Now, this time of year,
you're gonna want lilies.

39:19.273 --> 39:22.610
-W... why this time of year?
-Because lilies are spring,

39:22.693 --> 39:25.237
and in December,
what you want more than anything else,

39:25.321 --> 39:27.323
is a suggestion of spring.

39:27.698 --> 39:29.909
These Madonna lilies
are absolutely gorgeous.

39:30.368 --> 39:34.580
(SNIFFS) Uh... They smell
a little like a funeral home.

39:36.332 --> 39:37.333
All right.

39:37.833 --> 39:39.752
Uh... We also have some paper whites.

39:39.835 --> 39:42.797
Oh, and we just got in
these big-headed French tulips.

39:43.172 --> 39:44.548
What about roses?

39:44.924 --> 39:48.135
Oh, we have some, uh, sterling
silver roses, Flemish roses.

39:48.219 --> 39:49.470
Red roses.

39:51.555 --> 39:53.891
-Six dollars a stem.
-Right, give me a dozen.

39:54.308 --> 39:56.685
Probably want baby's breath
and greens with that?

39:56.852 --> 39:59.146
Uh... Yeah. And, uh,

39:59.480 --> 40:02.691
I want you to put this 100-dollar bill
in the envelope with a card.

40:03.776 --> 40:06.779
And, uh, what do you want
the card to say?

40:08.697 --> 40:09.907
From Greg.

40:18.874 --> 40:20.793
MALE VOICE: If you'll come out there
with me this weekend,

40:20.918 --> 40:23.629
I'm certain, uh, you'll have a good time.

40:25.047 --> 40:26.841
It could be a good career move for you.

40:26.924 --> 40:29.927
I can introduce you to all kinds
of very influential people there.

40:30.010 --> 40:32.805
Hey, will you, could you
talk some sense into her?

40:32.888 --> 40:35.474
-I can try.
-Oh, come on, Judge. (CHUCKLES)

40:35.558 --> 40:38.018
There's a weekend retreat
at the Mohonk Mountain House

40:38.102 --> 40:41.814
for training prosecutors, and judges,
and in handling terrorism cases.

40:42.231 --> 40:43.899
I think she should attend.

40:45.401 --> 40:46.652
Remember Valentine's Day?

40:48.529 --> 40:50.656
Uh... Yeah, it was great.

40:51.031 --> 40:53.367
JOHN JR: This past year,
Valentine's Day fell on a Saturday.

40:53.534 --> 40:55.453
We went up there, had a great weekend.

40:55.703 --> 40:59.999
Oh, I... I didn't, uh, realize
you were seeing anyone.

41:00.416 --> 41:04.920
Well, we're keeping it quiet
as much as possible 'cause of work.

41:05.087 --> 41:07.256
Yeah. Oh, yeah, I understand completely.

41:07.631 --> 41:09.842
Excuse me, uh, they're waiting for you
on the dais, Your Honor.

41:09.925 --> 41:10.968
Oh, okay. Um...

41:11.969 --> 41:14.013
-Nice meeting you, Detective.
-Great to meet you, Judge.

41:16.015 --> 41:17.183
(CHUCKLES)

41:20.144 --> 41:23.272
How did you happen to know
that Valentine's Day fell on a Saturday?

41:23.439 --> 41:25.983
I have a head for odd details like that.

41:26.108 --> 41:28.903
It wouldn't be because you had
a particular memorable one this past year?

41:28.986 --> 41:30.571
No, not at all.

41:31.655 --> 41:34.533
-Well, thanks for coming up with it.
-You're very welcome.

41:57.056 --> 41:59.850
-Have you told anyone?
-There's nothin' to tell.

42:00.351 --> 42:01.644
That's not quite true.

42:02.394 --> 42:03.938
You know something about me.

42:04.855 --> 42:07.024
I wanna know what you intend
to do with that knowledge.

42:08.192 --> 42:10.611
I found your credit card,
I returned it to you.

42:11.153 --> 42:12.613
I don't know anything more than that.

42:17.910 --> 42:19.495
