00:14.208 --> 00:16.834
Oh yeah. Waxy wednesday,

00:16.917 --> 00:19.625
Where a plastic tray meets
a freshly-buffed floor

00:19.709 --> 00:21.333
and legends are born.

00:21.417 --> 00:24.792
-
- Hey, guys. I got the trays.

00:24.875 --> 00:26.709
Any problems getting by
Marge the lunch lady?

00:26.792 --> 00:29.792
Nah, she said they don't pay her
enough to care.

00:30.792 --> 00:33.792
Guys, did I miss anything?

00:33.917 --> 00:36.500
Not yet. Hey, shouldn't you
be in detention

00:36.583 --> 00:38.917
for putting a tollbooth
in the boys' bathroom?

00:40.041 --> 00:43.750
I should be, but when you sit me
in the back and leave a window open,

00:43.834 --> 00:45.959
I'm what they call a flight risk.

00:47.542 --> 00:49.458
Jack, your record's about to be broken.

00:50.083 --> 00:52.375
Prepare for the new world champion,

00:52.458 --> 00:55.041
Milton "the missile" Krupnick.

00:57.875 --> 01:00.166
- Ooh!
- Okay.

01:00.709 --> 01:02.750
Dude, eat a sandwich.

01:06.458 --> 01:10.500
Oh, look at this. I've walked into
the middle of a loser-palooza.

01:10.583 --> 01:12.250
What do you want, Truman?

01:12.333 --> 01:14.041
I thought I'd just hang out.

01:14.125 --> 01:15.542
Do you have to do it here?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.875
It's a free hallway, Jerry.

01:17.959 --> 01:19.667
Truman, if you'll excuse me,

01:19.750 --> 01:21.375
I have a date with destiny.

01:21.458 --> 01:23.542
Well, that'll be your first date ever.

01:25.041 --> 01:27.542
Very funny.

01:27.625 --> 01:29.792
You're about to see my skid marks.

01:31.875 --> 01:34.250
Okay, I thought that was
gonna sound different when it came out.

01:37.917 --> 01:42.583
Okay, guys, this garbage can
marks Jack's record of 47 floor tiles.

01:55.792 --> 01:57.917
He just shattered your record...

01:58.000 --> 02:01.208
and that papier-mache
solar system outside the science room.

02:01.291 --> 02:03.417
It looks like somebody greased his tray.

02:03.500 --> 02:05.083
Looks like.

02:10.250 --> 02:12.041
Looks like saturn is now lodged

02:12.125 --> 02:13.625
in the dark side of the moon.

Something's different.
Wait, don't tell me.

03:19.750 --> 03:21.458
New bathrobe.

03:23.875 --> 03:26.583
It's my hair.
This is what I get for showering.

03:28.166 --> 03:30.375
Rudy, what kind of shampoo are we using?

03:30.458 --> 03:32.667
That's the same shampoo we always use.

03:33.375 --> 03:35.250
What? This isn't shampoo.

03:35.333 --> 03:36.917
It's pink hair dye.

03:39.208 --> 03:41.709
Dude, do you shampoo your leg hair?

03:42.834 --> 03:46.417
Bro, when I shampoo, I'm all in.

03:47.625 --> 03:49.750
Love your new look!

03:49.834 --> 03:52.375
Awesome. Just awesome.

03:53.125 --> 03:54.709
I know you did this, Truman.

03:54.792 --> 03:56.125
Somehow you snuck in here

03:56.208 --> 03:58.083
and switched out that shampoo
for pink hair dye.

03:58.166 --> 04:00.125
- What?
<i>No, it wasn't Truman.</i>

04:00.208 --> 04:03.208
I've been here all day and I never once
saw him ooze his way in here.

04:04.417 --> 04:06.709
Looks like I've got an airtight alibi.

04:06.792 --> 04:09.291
See ya around, <i>Pinky.</i>

04:10.000 --> 04:13.500
-
- Pinky?

04:14.083 --> 04:15.667
Why would anyone call me "Pinky"?

04:15.750 --> 04:17.375
Ow!

04:17.458 --> 04:19.166
Oh, I get it.

04:23.625 --> 04:25.417

04:34.166 --> 04:35.917
Perfection!

04:36.458 --> 04:38.750
I don't know what we're looking at.

04:39.750 --> 04:41.375
It's a single grain of rice.

04:41.458 --> 04:43.667
I spent over $1,000 on it.

04:43.750 --> 04:45.875
A Tibetan monk spent a year engraving

04:45.959 --> 04:47.583
- the wasabi code on it.
- Mmm.

04:48.417 --> 04:50.959
I once wrote my name
on a corn dog with mustard.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.792
But then I ate it,
so I really can't prove it.

04:54.125 --> 04:56.166
Lonnie, you could never appreciate

04:56.250 --> 04:57.834
such a precious piece of art.

04:57.917 --> 05:01.000
You own a reptile store
and your car has a tail.

05:01.083 --> 05:01.917
Hmm.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.709
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

05:05.792 --> 05:08.000
- That did not just happen!
- It sure did.

05:08.083 --> 05:10.125
- Well, we'll see you around.
- No, no, no, no!

05:10.208 --> 05:13.542
No no, you open your girlfriend's mouth

05:13.625 --> 05:16.375
- 'Cause I'm going in!
- Just relax.

05:16.458 --> 05:19.417
- It'll come out in her poop.
- How long is that gonna take?

05:19.500 --> 05:21.875
Well, Brazilian monkey lizards
usually go once a year,

05:21.959 --> 05:23.792
and she just went, so a year.

05:23.875 --> 05:26.500
No no no, I-- I can't wait a whole year.

05:26.583 --> 05:28.458
You know what? We have to trick her

05:28.542 --> 05:30.417
into thinking
that the seasons are changing.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.083
Are you insane?

05:32.208 --> 05:34.166
You seriously think
you can outsmart a lizard?

05:34.291 --> 05:36.500
It sleeps in a sock
and its best friend is a stick,

05:36.583 --> 05:38.750
- so I'm gonna go with "yes."
-

05:40.041 --> 05:42.083
- Wait, what was that?
-

05:42.166 --> 05:43.959
It sounded like that thing
just laughed at me.

05:44.041 --> 05:47.125
Don't be ridiculous.
lizards don't know how to laugh.

05:53.750 --> 05:55.667
Come on, people! Let's make some noise!

05:55.750 --> 05:57.500
As the captain of our pep squad,

05:57.583 --> 06:01.959
Kim Crawford leads out
our championship girls' basketball team.

06:02.041 --> 06:03.959
The Seaford

06:04.041 --> 06:06.500
- lady whales!
-

06:06.583 --> 06:07.917
-
- All right, girls,

06:08.000 --> 06:09.125
when I break through that paper,

06:09.208 --> 06:11.333
I want you guys to keep going,
throw your hands up in the air

06:11.417 --> 06:13.667
and pep that crowd up! Come on, everyone!

06:13.750 --> 06:15.750
- Pep, pep, pep!
-

06:18.125 --> 06:20.000
Come on!

06:21.250 --> 06:22.834
Oh!

06:28.083 --> 06:31.792
Look like you got yourself
into a <i>sticky</i> situation.

06:40.291 --> 06:42.083
Okay.
-

06:42.166 --> 06:44.291
- I love the fall.
- Mmm.

06:44.375 --> 06:47.083
I can't believe it's thanksgiving already.

06:47.166 --> 06:49.709
But I guess that's what
happens when time passes

06:49.792 --> 06:52.083
and the seasons change.

06:52.875 --> 06:54.709
Almost makes you wanna poop.

06:55.417 --> 06:57.333
Do not rush it.

06:57.792 --> 07:00.959
Now let's eat.

07:01.417 --> 07:04.750
Mmm. How's the turkey?

07:04.834 --> 07:07.041
I don't know. The stuffing's pretty good.

07:07.125 --> 07:10.333
Eh, it's Lenore's favorite.
It's got meal worms in it.

07:19.333 --> 07:22.583
Check it out, Heather Clark.

07:22.875 --> 07:24.750
<i>Oh, she's reading the note
I left in her locker,</i>

07:24.834 --> 07:26.750
which means she's gonna come over here.

07:26.834 --> 07:29.291
- Pit crew, go, go, go, go.

07:40.917 --> 07:42.709
- Roll, roll, roll, roll.
- Wait, wait, wait.

07:42.792 --> 07:45.667
A final touch, a splash of cologne.

07:49.166 --> 07:50.959
Ah.

07:51.875 --> 07:53.250
What the--

07:53.375 --> 07:56.792
Oh! Someone put bleu cheese in my cologne.

07:56.875 --> 07:59.083
I can't stand bleu cheese.

07:59.458 --> 08:01.125
Remember what happened
when he smelled it at--

08:01.208 --> 08:03.083
Whoa, don't-- don't hurl, man.
Or think about hurling.

08:03.166 --> 08:04.959
Or the taste in your mouth
you get right before--

08:05.041 --> 08:05.875
Shut it!

08:06.458 --> 08:09.375
Hey, Jack, I got your note.
I thought it was really sweet.

08:12.250 --> 08:14.458
-
- Eww!

08:14.542 --> 08:16.583
You just yakked on my shoes!

08:25.125 --> 08:27.709
It's a category five hurl-icane!

08:31.125 --> 08:34.041
Guys, we all know Truman's
behind all these pranks.

08:34.458 --> 08:36.542
We just gotta figure out
how he's doing it.

08:36.625 --> 08:39.750
Grease, hair dye, sticky paper
and bleu cheese--

08:39.834 --> 08:41.917
Sounds like my grandmother's
medicine cabinet.

08:43.542 --> 08:45.625
Truman's picking us off one by one.

08:45.709 --> 08:48.375
He's got all of us, except for...

08:49.000 --> 08:51.917
- Eddie.
- What are you guys saying?

08:53.583 --> 08:55.333
We're saying you're next.

08:55.875 --> 08:59.792
If I were you, I'd roll myself up
in bubble wrap and sit in the basement.

09:01.792 --> 09:04.875
I did that when my father showed me
my own birth video.

09:06.083 --> 09:08.250
Do you guys have any idea
where we come from?

09:09.750 --> 09:11.750
My mother told me it was a pumpkin patch.

09:13.250 --> 09:14.667
I wish.

09:17.583 --> 09:19.083
I think what Eddie needs to hear

09:19.166 --> 09:20.667
is that we're gonna be there for him.

09:20.750 --> 09:23.875
Guys, guys, I can take care of myself.

09:23.959 --> 09:26.792
No, no, no, don't worry, Eddie.
We'll protect you.

09:26.875 --> 09:28.667
We'll walk you to school in the morning...

09:28.750 --> 09:30.458
And after school we'll walk you back home.

09:30.542 --> 09:32.250
We'll be the last thing you see at night

09:32.333 --> 09:33.917
and the first thing you see
in the morning.

09:34.625 --> 09:36.458
How do you like your eggs?

09:37.458 --> 09:38.750
Guys, stop!

09:38.834 --> 09:40.667
I can't take it anymore!

09:41.125 --> 09:43.709
It wasn't Truman who pulled
those pranks on you.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.625
- Well, then who was it?
- It was me.

09:47.709 --> 09:48.792
What?

09:52.250 --> 09:54.500
Eddie, why would you prank us like that?

09:54.583 --> 09:57.375
Do you know what you did to me?
That paper was so sticky,

09:57.458 --> 09:59.625
I lost four freckles and half an eyebrow.

10:01.458 --> 10:03.083
And a clown keeps following me around

10:03.166 --> 10:04.792
asking me where I get my hair done.

10:06.166 --> 10:07.709
I didn't <i>want</i> to.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.709
Truman's been blackmailing me.

10:09.792 --> 10:11.792
How is he blackmailing you?

10:11.875 --> 10:14.917
Truman's father owns the security company
that watches the mall.

10:15.500 --> 10:17.709
- So?
- One night

10:17.792 --> 10:20.333
Rudy let me stay late
in the dojo to work on some moves.

10:21.208 --> 10:24.333
The thing is
I wasn't working on karate moves.

10:25.041 --> 10:28.250
- May I have this dance?
-

10:38.542 --> 10:40.834
You put on that cherry lip gloss for me?

10:46.333 --> 10:48.917
Truman saw everything
from his father's office.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.959
He put it on a flash drive

10:52.041 --> 10:53.834
and unless I do whatever he says,

10:53.917 --> 10:55.417
he's gonna put it on the internet.

10:58.041 --> 11:01.250
- I'm sorry, guys.
- It's okay, Eddie.

11:01.333 --> 11:02.959
He's not gonna get away with it.

11:03.667 --> 11:06.041
Truman's gonna be sorry he messed with us.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.917
When you poke a bear,
do you know what happens?

11:10.000 --> 11:11.208
Seriously, does anybody know?

11:18.333 --> 11:20.583
-
Brr! Whoa.

11:20.667 --> 11:22.250
What are you guys doing in here?

11:22.375 --> 11:24.709
Just celebrating Christmas
with a monkey lizard

11:24.792 --> 11:27.208
waiting for it to poop out something
that belongs to me.

11:27.792 --> 11:30.208
Oh, right on. Wait.

11:30.291 --> 11:32.583
How do you know the lizard's not jewish
and celebrates hanukkah?

11:34.750 --> 11:36.500
- We don't.
- Oh!

11:36.583 --> 11:40.000
<i>♪ Hanukkah, hanukkah ♪</i>

11:40.083 --> 11:42.500
<i>♪ Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-hanukkah ♪</i>

11:42.583 --> 11:45.583
<i>♪ And a happy kwanzaa too... ♪</i>

11:45.667 --> 11:47.667
- Just covering my bases.
- Oh.

11:47.750 --> 11:51.166
<i>♪ Don't you think It's time
For you to poo? ♪</i>

11:55.917 --> 11:58.709
Okay, our mission is to get
into the security office

11:58.792 --> 12:00.250
and grab the flash drive out of the safe.

12:00.333 --> 12:01.667
Let's go over the plan one more time.

12:01.750 --> 12:03.834
I'll get Truman out of the office

12:03.917 --> 12:05.542
by taking him to the parking lot

12:05.625 --> 12:07.917
and letting him shoot paintballs at me.

12:09.417 --> 12:11.917
- You think he'll go for it?
- I'm pretty sure.

12:16.125 --> 12:18.542
Once we're inside, I'll
disarm the security system.

12:18.625 --> 12:21.041
- I'll crack the safe.
- Out in the courtyard,

12:21.125 --> 12:22.834
I'll distract the security guard.

12:22.917 --> 12:25.834
And I'll distract the guard's dog.

12:26.166 --> 12:27.834
How are you gonna distract the dog?

12:27.917 --> 12:29.542
See, I don't know
if you know this about me,

12:29.625 --> 12:32.583
but I was partially raised by wolves.

12:34.375 --> 12:36.041
That actually explains a lot.

12:37.375 --> 12:40.917
Check it.

12:47.417 --> 12:48.750
Those are my peeps.

12:50.083 --> 12:52.792
Only one more season
until this glorified wallet

12:52.875 --> 12:55.166
gives me back my rice. Now let's go.

12:55.250 --> 12:58.750
Hey, whoa. You're forgetting
the best part of spring break.

13:00.166 --> 13:03.166
- Wet t-shirt contest!
-

13:03.250 --> 13:05.667
- Oh yeah!
- Whoo!

13:05.750 --> 13:07.750
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah!

13:07.834 --> 13:11.083
- Oh. Oh!
- Whoo! Whoo.

13:11.166 --> 13:14.166
- Your turn.
- Oh, okay.

13:14.250 --> 13:16.834
- Here we go.
- Yeah! Oh y--

13:16.917 --> 13:18.208
You win. Let's go.

13:20.792 --> 13:22.667
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

13:24.083 --> 13:27.709
Oh boy, we got another one.

13:28.792 --> 13:31.458
You know the mall is closed, right?

13:31.625 --> 13:33.709
Uh, yeah. I'm sorry.

13:33.792 --> 13:36.417
I was just trying to find a quiet place

13:36.500 --> 13:38.792
to try the hottest new celebrity workout.

13:38.875 --> 13:41.500
I told you that the mall is clos--

13:41.583 --> 13:44.500
Did you say "hottest
new celebrity workout"?

13:45.709 --> 13:49.000
Yeah, it combines karate with pilates.

13:49.083 --> 13:51.208
It's called, uh,

13:51.291 --> 13:53.125
karate-lates.

13:53.208 --> 13:56.792
Karate-lates. Wow.

13:56.875 --> 13:58.458
Do you think you could show me?

13:58.542 --> 14:01.458
Yeah, but not in front of the dog.

14:01.542 --> 14:03.750
It's based on actual dog movements,

14:03.834 --> 14:05.750
and if he sees it...

14:05.834 --> 14:07.583
He'll think you're making fun of him.

14:07.667 --> 14:10.667
Oh, that totally makes sense.

14:10.750 --> 14:13.041
King, take five.

14:13.125 --> 14:15.792
Mommy's going to try some karate-lates.

14:19.625 --> 14:21.750
- Okay, right on.
-

14:21.834 --> 14:23.750
-
- Oh look at this.

14:23.834 --> 14:25.917
We're gonna sweat. It's gonna get intense.

14:29.041 --> 14:32.750
- Okay, close your eyes...
- Okay, can do.

14:32.834 --> 14:36.041
- And, um,
- Mm-hmm, closed.

14:36.083 --> 14:38.375
- breathe like a dog.
- Oh, okay.

14:47.500 --> 14:49.792
Yo, what up, dog?

14:49.875 --> 14:52.250
Yeah, you and I, we like the same things.

14:52.375 --> 14:55.500
Chasing cats, chewing on slippers

14:55.583 --> 14:57.750
and dragging our butts across the carpet.

14:58.792 --> 15:00.709
You know what I'm talking about.

15:12.792 --> 15:16.500
Wow, military-grade security lasers.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.458
Okay, now that I did not expect.

15:20.041 --> 15:21.667
Kill switch is on the other side.

15:21.750 --> 15:23.250
How do we get past this?

15:23.333 --> 15:24.834
Very carefully.

15:27.834 --> 15:30.333
Whoa.

15:42.125 --> 15:43.834
Whoa!

15:57.125 --> 15:58.709
-
- Let's go.

16:03.291 --> 16:05.875
- There it is.
- No, no, no!

16:05.959 --> 16:07.709
There's weight sensors in the carpet.

16:07.792 --> 16:10.083
- We can't walk on the floor.
- Well, what do we do?

16:23.583 --> 16:25.250
Hey, come on.

16:27.750 --> 16:29.667
How do we get across the office?

16:30.875 --> 16:32.583
I'll carry you across, okay?

16:32.667 --> 16:34.875
You open that safe
and get the flash drive.

16:34.959 --> 16:38.250
- Let's go.
-

16:40.250 --> 16:42.125
All right.

16:43.333 --> 16:44.959
- Truman has...
-

16:45.041 --> 16:47.750
four brothers. Okay.

16:47.834 --> 16:51.041
- He's claimed to have kissed seven girls.
-

16:51.125 --> 16:53.333
- Lying.
- What?

16:53.417 --> 16:56.250
- And he has three nipples.
-

16:56.333 --> 16:58.750
- Yes.
- Yes, you did it.

16:58.834 --> 17:01.041
You made that last one up, didn't you?

17:01.125 --> 17:04.125
No. He swims at my y.

17:04.959 --> 17:07.291
Oh. Yes!

17:09.250 --> 17:10.500
Okay, now how do we get down?

17:11.125 --> 17:12.917
That's a very good question.

17:15.917 --> 17:17.792
We've got the flash drive. Let's go.

17:18.917 --> 17:21.625
Wow. Very nice form.

17:21.709 --> 17:24.792
You're a fast learner. You feel the burn?

17:24.875 --> 17:26.875
Whoo-wee! I feel it!

17:27.875 --> 17:29.375
Hey, look.

17:29.458 --> 17:31.875
My butt's looking better already.

17:31.959 --> 17:34.166
Karate-lates.

17:34.250 --> 17:36.959
I'm in. Whoo!

17:37.041 --> 17:40.667
Breaking into my father's office?

17:40.750 --> 17:42.875
You guys are in so much trouble!

17:42.959 --> 17:46.166
We'll take whatever comes,
but we had to help a friend out.

17:46.250 --> 17:49.375
I want that flash drive
and I want it right <i>now.</i>

17:49.458 --> 17:51.250
All right, all right, we'll give it back.

17:51.333 --> 17:54.875
But first we've got another video
we want you to see.

17:54.959 --> 17:56.750
-
- What are you talking about?

17:57.500 --> 17:59.250
Here you go.

17:59.333 --> 18:02.959
<i>Okay.</i>

18:04.500 --> 18:05.959
Truman's on his way in.

18:06.041 --> 18:07.959
He's about to find out
about the flash drive.

18:08.041 --> 18:10.083
I don't think he's gonna take it too well.

18:20.625 --> 18:23.625
Hey, why is the safe open?

18:23.709 --> 18:25.917
Where's the flash drive?

18:26.000 --> 18:29.333
No!

18:29.417 --> 18:31.709
It's the worst day of my life!

18:31.792 --> 18:35.000
Ah! I'm gonna run away
and never come back!

18:48.000 --> 18:50.875
Yup, I got your whole crybaby freak-out.

18:52.750 --> 18:55.375
Doesn't feel so good when it's you,
does it, Truman?

18:55.458 --> 18:58.875
If that thing gets out,
my life will be over!

18:58.959 --> 19:02.458
I'll be known as tantrum boy.

19:05.041 --> 19:07.458
Please tell me you won't post that video.

19:07.542 --> 19:09.291
We're not gonna post it.

19:09.542 --> 19:10.959
We're not like you, Truman.

19:11.041 --> 19:14.125
Hey, how about a deal?
We destroy both videos

19:14.208 --> 19:16.125
and you never mess with us again, deal?

19:16.208 --> 19:19.208
Deal. Just delete it, Please. <i>Please!</i>

19:24.917 --> 19:27.625
You know I only,
I only melted down like that

19:27.750 --> 19:29.542
because I knew the camera was there.

19:29.625 --> 19:32.333
I was just putting on a show.

19:32.375 --> 19:34.041
Well, show's over.

19:34.583 --> 19:35.917
When you mess with one of us,

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
you mess with all of us.

19:38.417 --> 19:39.750
Bye, Truman.

19:40.250 --> 19:41.542
Bye, Eddie.

19:41.875 --> 19:44.166
- Maybe next week we can go paintball--
- Get out.

19:49.792 --> 19:52.709
Eddie, remember what you just told Truman.

19:52.792 --> 19:56.375
If you're in trouble,
we'll always be there for you.

19:56.458 --> 19:58.166
Got it.

19:58.250 --> 19:59.875
Thanks, guys.

20:00.333 --> 20:01.792
Has anyone seen Jerry?

20:01.875 --> 20:04.667
Last time I saw him,
he was out in the courtyard.

20:04.750 --> 20:07.000
So the thing about me is
that I'm pretty tough,

20:07.083 --> 20:09.166
but I also have a sensitive side.

20:09.250 --> 20:12.250
My perfect date would end
with a moonlit walk on the beach.

20:12.834 --> 20:14.333
What are you doing with my dog?

20:14.375 --> 20:15.625
Oh, I'm just getting to know her.

20:15.709 --> 20:17.625
You know he's a boy, right?

20:19.417 --> 20:21.125
This is really awkward.

20:21.417 --> 20:23.041
It is for all of us.

20:24.125 --> 20:25.834
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

20:29.834 --> 20:32.333
This summer heat is gonna kill me.

20:32.417 --> 20:34.583
Not if I kill you first.

20:35.500 --> 20:38.041
When is this thing going
to poop out my rice?

20:38.125 --> 20:40.417
She usually does it after the fireworks.

20:40.500 --> 20:43.041
It's the combination
of fear and patriotism.

20:43.125 --> 20:46.208
- We don't have any fireworks.
- Oh, don't we?

20:46.291 --> 20:48.709
-
- Ooh!

20:48.792 --> 20:51.875
-
- Look at that one.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.792
-
- That one's in the shape of a ball.

20:54.875 --> 20:56.333
All right, all right, enough!

20:56.750 --> 20:59.083
- This is the stupidest thing that I've--
-

20:59.166 --> 21:03.458
Oh, I believe that is for you.

21:05.875 --> 21:08.166
- Good girl.
- Oh.

21:09.458 --> 21:10.542
My rice.

21:11.250 --> 21:14.375
I finally have back the most
precious thing I ever--

21:14.458 --> 21:16.458
-
- Oh!

21:16.542 --> 21:18.875
-
- Oh. Oh.

21:18.959 --> 21:20.542
Ah!

21:23.083 --> 21:26.583
So I guess I'll see you at thanksgiving.

21:26.667 --> 21:28.542
Yeah. Yeah.
