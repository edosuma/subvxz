Of course I do.
Why do you even have
to ask a thing like that ?

01:29.521 --> 01:31.690

01:31.757 --> 01:36.094
That if two people enjoy
being alone together,

These headlines'd

02:49.334 --> 02:53.204
Look at this.
"Unemployment at

"Rise of strikes
expected."

02:56.008 --> 02:58.409
"No end to
inflation seen."

02:58.477 --> 03:02.013
Nixon predicts
great year.
Huh ?
Where's it say that ?

03:02.081 --> 03:04.783
You mean he didn't
say that today ?

03:06.485 --> 03:09.620
Ain't you got nothin'
better to do than ridicule
your own president ?

03:09.688 --> 03:12.356
You gotta admit,
he does lend himself to it.

03:12.424 --> 03:14.525
Watch it !
Watch it, watch it !

03:14.593 --> 03:17.762
Oh, come on, daddy.
The president is
the administration.

03:17.830 --> 03:20.932
And lots of people
are criticizing
the administration today.

03:21.000 --> 03:26.504
Not in this house they don't,
'cause in this house it's
"my country, right or wrong."

03:26.571 --> 03:29.974
Yeah, but, Archie,
that's outmoded thinking.
It doesn't work.

03:30.042 --> 03:32.576
In today's society,
if something doesn't work,
you throw it out.

03:32.644 --> 03:36.781
Well, you don't work.
Maybe we better throw you out.

03:36.849 --> 03:41.286
You wanna throw somebody out,
why don't you start with
your buddy Nixon, huh ?

03:41.353 --> 03:44.923
I mean, it wasn't me who started
that unemployment rate goin' up
or the inflation.

03:44.990 --> 03:47.758
And Mr. Nixon didn't
start them things either.

03:47.827 --> 03:52.763
You take inflation.
Inflation is directly connected
to your wage-price index.

03:52.832 --> 03:57.168
The president's got nothin'
to do with it, 'cause his wage
is fixed by congress...

03:57.236 --> 04:00.071
And so is his price.

04:00.139 --> 04:02.640
That'll teach you
to argue economics
with daddy.

04:02.708 --> 04:05.343
He nailed me good
that time.
Yeah.

04:05.410 --> 04:09.413
Hey, ma, are you
darning socks again ?
There's a hole in the toe.

04:09.481 --> 04:12.416
Well, so throw 'em away
and buy a new pair.
Oh, that's right.

04:12.484 --> 04:15.686
Throw 'em away.
Got any idea
what socks cost today ?

04:15.754 --> 04:18.488
No, I don't know.
That's the trouble
with you kids nowadays.

04:18.557 --> 04:21.024
You don't know what
nothin' costs.

04:21.093 --> 04:23.761
When I was a kid,
I was so poor that--

04:23.829 --> 04:26.430
you were lucky
to even have socks !

04:26.498 --> 04:30.401
That's right !
Many's the time
we had to take--

04:30.469 --> 04:32.871
stuff cardboard
in the soles of your shoes !

04:32.938 --> 04:34.873
That's right !

04:34.940 --> 04:37.041
We were so poor
that some mornings
going to school--

04:37.109 --> 04:41.913
you had to tramp ten Miles
though the blinding snow
and the freezing rain.

04:41.981 --> 04:44.082
Absolutely !

04:44.149 --> 04:48.286
Didn't they ever have any good
weather when you were a kid ?

04:48.354 --> 04:50.288
I don't remember none.

04:50.356 --> 04:54.158
I think they invented
good weather around 1940.

04:54.226 --> 04:56.928
Oh, I remember
some sunny days.

05:02.234 --> 05:04.335
They must've been
before we met.

05:07.339 --> 05:10.841
Come to think of it--
aw, stifle yourself,
will ya.

05:10.910 --> 05:13.878
We're going to the museum.
Bye, ma. Bye, daddy.
Yeah, see you folks later.

05:13.946 --> 05:15.880
Bye-bye.

05:17.283 --> 05:21.652
These socks cost
three pairs for two dollars.

05:21.720 --> 05:24.322
What would one pair be ?

05:24.390 --> 05:28.726
I think I'll go upstairs
and get a pencil and paper
and figure that out.

05:28.794 --> 05:32.163
Aw, don't do that, Edith.
Who cares ?

05:32.231 --> 05:35.733

Oh, Mr. bunker--

05:51.350 --> 05:54.118
no, you see,
I got nothin' to do with it.

It goes to all the charities,
including the black ones.

05:57.423 --> 05:59.623
Yeah, but, Mr.--
and I wanna
tell you something.

05:59.691 --> 06:03.227

credit for all you're trying

Uh, Mr. bunker.

06:05.897 --> 06:09.334

for a charity. I'm here

- oh, I got the key.

to Jim bowman's house.

right to work.

Oh, by the way, would it be
too much trouble to borrow
a pail from you ?

06:35.127 --> 06:39.297
I forgot to bring one.
Oh, sure. Oh, you got
your work cut out for you.

06:39.365 --> 06:44.402
I don't think that house
has been cleaned since his
wife died three years ago.

06:44.470 --> 06:49.073
And way before that.
Bowman and his wife was
always slobs, the both of them.

06:49.141 --> 06:51.342

I'll get the pail.

06:51.410 --> 06:53.344

anything else you need,
just come over and ask me.

07:50.169 --> 07:53.604
All right. Thank you so much.
I'll return it in
a couple of hours.

07:56.175 --> 07:59.210
Hey. How come you got
Jim bowman's key ?

07:59.278 --> 08:03.347
'Cause it ain't
Jim bowman's house anymore.
He sold it.

08:03.415 --> 08:05.483
He sold it ?

08:05.551 --> 08:08.286
Ohh,
that explains it.

08:08.353 --> 08:10.988
I knew he'd never hire
no cleaning woman.

08:11.056 --> 08:13.491
He sold his house ?
Yeah.

08:13.559 --> 08:16.660
Shee, imagine that.
[ Chuckles ]

08:16.728 --> 08:20.598
So he finally found a sucker
for that pile of shingles.

08:20.665 --> 08:24.402
I think it's a very nice house.
Aw, get outta here.
It's a dumb house.

08:24.470 --> 08:27.972
What's dumb about it ?
It's laid out bad, Edith.

08:28.039 --> 08:30.541
Oh, it's exactly
the same as ours.

08:30.609 --> 08:33.111
Oh, Edith. You see,
that's how much you notice.

08:33.178 --> 08:37.181
That's typically you.
It ain't the same at all,
see ?

08:37.249 --> 08:42.052
Now, our front door is there.
He's got a front door
over there, right ?

08:42.121 --> 08:45.656
We got a bathroom and bedroom
up there. He's got a bathroom,
bedroom over there.

08:45.724 --> 08:48.759
He's got stairs there.
We got the stairs over here.

08:48.827 --> 08:52.163
Yeah, all the houses
are built exactly the same,

08:52.231 --> 08:54.898
except some of them
are turned around.

08:54.966 --> 08:57.067
Those are the ones
that are dumb !

08:59.238 --> 09:01.539
Bowman's is a dumb house.

09:01.607 --> 09:03.974
It's laid out bad.

09:04.042 --> 09:06.677
I wonder who he
sold it to though.

09:10.215 --> 09:13.451
Oh, Mr. bowman,
I'm so glad you're here.

09:13.519 --> 09:15.986
I just noticed a new crack
in the ceiling.

09:16.054 --> 09:18.156
Mrs. Jefferson,
you bought a perfect house.

09:18.223 --> 09:21.725
You're gonna be very happy here,
so let's not start
with none of that, huh ?

09:21.793 --> 09:24.595
Well, my sister just talked
with the movers, and--
look, let's go inside and talk.

09:24.663 --> 09:28.633
Why should everyone
know our business ?
We're gonna move in on Thursday.

09:28.700 --> 09:32.436
Swell. Make it at night,
about 9:00.
We can't move in at night !

09:32.504 --> 09:36.774
I'll be moved out by then.
Let's get inside. We could
get hit by a car out here.

09:36.841 --> 09:39.076
But-- but I--

09:39.144 --> 09:42.513
you know, Edith,
I got one thing figured out.

09:42.581 --> 09:45.183
Whoever it is
bought bowman's house
must be doin' pretty good...

09:45.250 --> 09:47.618
If he can lay out
eight, ten dollars a day
for a cleaning woman.

09:47.686 --> 09:49.620
Ten dollars ?

09:49.688 --> 09:53.757
Oh, they're getting
more than that for
good cleaning people today.

09:53.825 --> 09:57.461
Maybe she's a live-in maid.
What are you
talkin' about, Edith ?

09:57.529 --> 10:02.633
The only people nowadays
can afford live-in help
are rich people and Jews.

10:04.503 --> 10:06.937
Not all Jewish people
are rich.

10:07.005 --> 10:09.973
I never knew one
that wasn't !

10:10.041 --> 10:12.910
The steiners from
our old neighborhood weren't.

10:12.977 --> 10:15.546
They didn't have
as much as we did, even.

10:15.614 --> 10:17.848
Yeah, to hear them tell it.

10:17.916 --> 10:23.321
Hey, you don't suppose
bowman sold his house to
one of that tribe, do ya ?

10:24.690 --> 10:26.790
I mean,
he was always a jerk,

10:26.858 --> 10:29.260
but he wouldn't do a thing
like that to this neighborhood,
would he ?

10:29.328 --> 10:31.429
Well, what I'm wondering is,

10:31.496 --> 10:35.600
if a rich Jewish person
could afford to hire a maid,

10:35.667 --> 10:39.670
why would he buy
Jim bowman's old house ?

10:39.738 --> 10:44.609
To make trouble, Edith,
that's why.

10:44.676 --> 10:48.078
These people are always lookin'
to make a test case.

10:48.146 --> 10:51.014
Why do you think
they got that there,
uh, organization there--

10:51.082 --> 10:53.951
whaddya call it ?
B'Nai bris.

10:56.221 --> 11:00.258
Well, I'm gonna go over
there and find out.
Where are you going ?

11:00.325 --> 11:05.296
I'm just gonna take a walk over
to Jim bowman's house and talk
to him about it, that's all.

11:05.364 --> 11:07.898
Where's my lumberjack ?
Right in there.

11:07.966 --> 11:10.635
Where ?
Somewhere in there.

11:10.702 --> 11:14.372
Well, "somewhere in there"
ain't "right in there," Edith.

11:14.439 --> 11:17.107
How about right in there
somewhere ?

11:17.175 --> 11:19.610
Will you get in there
and get the jacket ?

11:21.713 --> 11:23.648
It was right there.

11:23.715 --> 11:26.917
You sure have
your little ways
of torturing me, Edith.

11:37.429 --> 11:40.364
<i>Hey, bowman !</i>
<i>A-Archie !</i>

11:40.432 --> 11:44.168
I just come over
to congratulate you.
I heard you sold the house.

11:44.235 --> 11:47.638
Oh, th-th-that's very nice
of you, Archie.
I-I-I appreciate it.

11:47.706 --> 11:51.008
Yeah. Hey, wait a minute.
Where're you goin' ? I want
to ask you about the people.

11:51.075 --> 11:53.911
I mean, how are they ?
Are they nice people
and all ?

11:53.978 --> 11:57.515
Oh, they're fine people.
Salt of the earth.

11:57.582 --> 12:01.018
Archie, I don't have much
wall space at the new place
I'm moving into,

12:01.085 --> 12:05.989
so I thought maybe you
and Edith could use this.

12:06.057 --> 12:09.460
Or do you already have a picture
of Charles a. Lindbergh ?

12:09.528 --> 12:12.563
No, we ain't even
got anything close.

12:12.631 --> 12:15.065
Oh, thanks, Jim.
Don't mention it.
I gotta run.

12:15.133 --> 12:18.536
Yeah, wait a minute.
You know what was just
crossin' my mind ?

12:18.603 --> 12:21.472
Remember old man mcnab,
used to live
down the street there ?

12:21.540 --> 12:25.476
Remember the time he
was gonna sell his place
to them Jews ?
Oh !

12:25.544 --> 12:28.612
And you come around with
that petition for all
the rest of us to sign.

12:28.680 --> 12:31.949
Remember ? Keep 'em out ?
We all signed it, eh ?
Yeah.

12:32.016 --> 12:35.686
Yeah. You really saved
the block that time, Jim.

12:35.754 --> 12:37.688
Well, you know me.

12:37.756 --> 12:42.626
So, I mean, you wouldn't then
turn around and do what mcnab
was tryin' to do, would ya ?

12:42.694 --> 12:44.962
You mean, sell to Jews ?
Yeah.

12:45.029 --> 12:47.297
Oh, no. No.

12:49.368 --> 12:51.902
These people are baptists.
Oh !

12:53.672 --> 12:58.108
Oh, that's nice, Jim.
Mr. bowman, I just talked
with the telephone company.

12:58.176 --> 13:03.046
They're putting my phone in
today. Now I really believe
the house is mine.

13:03.114 --> 13:05.516
Oh, hi, neighbor.

13:13.658 --> 13:15.993
Archie--

13:24.770 --> 13:26.704
Archie, Archie, listen.

13:26.772 --> 13:30.240
The house has been on
the market for 11 months.
I was gettin' desperate.

13:30.308 --> 13:32.242
Sure, I admit it.

13:32.310 --> 13:35.413
But do you think I would
give the shaft to my friends
on this block...

13:35.480 --> 13:37.415
Out of my own
self-interest ?

13:37.482 --> 13:40.217
Never !

13:40.285 --> 13:42.653
I-- I sold to blacks,
Archie, because--

13:42.721 --> 13:45.989
Archie, I am tired
of hating people.

13:46.057 --> 13:48.392
I, uh, been thinking about this
for a long time now,

13:48.460 --> 13:52.296
and I really and truly believe
what I read on those
bumper stickers:

13:52.363 --> 13:54.498
"Good neighbors
come in all colors."

13:56.100 --> 13:59.470
What colors do they come
in your new neighborhood,
jimbo ?

13:59.538 --> 14:02.673
Here's what
you ought to do.
I don't wanna hear it.

14:02.741 --> 14:05.676
Archie, listen.
Talk to everyone
in the neighborhood.

14:05.744 --> 14:09.146
Get all our friends
together to chip in,
and you buy back the house.

14:09.213 --> 14:13.484
Then you turn around,
and you sell it back
to one of our own kind.

14:15.386 --> 14:19.222
What makes you think
these people are gonna
sell it back to us ?

14:19.290 --> 14:22.960
You offer the <i>schwarzers</i>
<i>a $2,000 profit.</i>

14:25.163 --> 14:27.598
You think they'll
go for it ?
They'll jump at it !

14:27.666 --> 14:31.936
They'll be so happy,
you'll have them tap dancing
all the way back to Harlem !

14:32.003 --> 14:34.672
Yeah ?
Sure !

14:38.142 --> 14:41.979
It's not a bad idea.
In fact, it's a good idea.

14:43.782 --> 14:46.684
Thanks, Jim.
What are friends for ?

14:51.289 --> 14:53.423
Gloria, believe me,
you'll get to love this.

14:53.492 --> 14:57.394
Well, put it down somewhere,
and we'll see how it looks.
Let's try the tv.

14:57.462 --> 15:00.631
All right.
I'll move this thing.
Okay.

15:05.003 --> 15:08.138
Huh ?
What do you think ?

15:08.206 --> 15:11.575
I don't know.
What do you mean,
you don't know ?

15:11.643 --> 15:14.979
That's truth staring you
right in the face.

15:15.046 --> 15:17.882
Can't you see that ?
I'm sorry.

15:17.949 --> 15:19.984
Look, it's all there--

15:20.051 --> 15:23.320
the total condemnation
of a plastic society,

15:23.388 --> 15:28.526
man's inhumanity to man
and the hope for a new
brotherhood shining through.

15:28.593 --> 15:31.028
Where ?
Where ? There !

15:31.095 --> 15:33.797
It's all there !
It's the overall effect.

15:33.865 --> 15:37.701
That's totally unique.
I guess so.

15:37.769 --> 15:40.704
I'm glad now we didn't
get the green one.

15:42.473 --> 15:45.142
Oh, I didn't know
you kids was back.

15:45.209 --> 15:47.545
Hi, ma.
Look what we rented
from the museum.

15:47.612 --> 15:51.782
Oh, my.
Ain't that nice ?

15:51.850 --> 15:55.786
I'm glad youse are all here,
all of us together,

15:55.854 --> 15:58.789
because we got a little
important talkin' to do.

15:58.857 --> 16:02.325
Did you see Jim bowman ?
I certainly did,
Edith.

16:02.393 --> 16:05.829
Wait'll you hear
what he done to us.
What has he done to ya ?

16:05.897 --> 16:09.332
Not only me--
to you, to you, to her,
to the whole neighborhood.

16:09.400 --> 16:12.369
Edith, Jim bowman
sold his home...

16:12.437 --> 16:15.305
To a family of spades.

16:19.811 --> 16:21.745
Oh, my.

16:21.813 --> 16:25.883
As if they didn't have
enough problems being Jewish.

16:33.157 --> 16:36.760
Edith,
it ain't their problem,
it's our problem !

16:36.828 --> 16:40.064
These people are
steppin' up in life,
and we're movin' down.

16:40.131 --> 16:43.333
How much you think our
property's gonna be worth with
them livin' two doors away ?

16:43.401 --> 16:45.736
Probably more than
it was worth before.

16:45.804 --> 16:48.271
Oh, listen to
Mr. real estate himself.

16:48.339 --> 16:50.608
He's gonna tell me
about land values now.

16:50.675 --> 16:54.311
He can't afford enough
to buy enough land
to put in a flower pot !

16:54.378 --> 16:57.314
Archie, they've done
sociological studies
on this thing--

16:57.381 --> 17:01.085
sociological studies !
There he goes again !
Yes. Yes, that's right.

17:01.152 --> 17:04.088
And they've shown that
the socioeconomic class
of the first black people...

17:04.155 --> 17:06.089
Moving into
a white neighborhood...

17:06.156 --> 17:08.858
Is usually higher than that
of the original inhabitants.

17:08.926 --> 17:11.494
Therefore,
the land values go up.

17:11.561 --> 17:15.132
Does anybody know what the hell
he's talkin' about ?

17:15.199 --> 17:19.737
Don't be upset, daddy.
Why, the answers are all
right here in this sculpture.

17:19.804 --> 17:22.506
Take, for instance,
what this represents.

17:22.573 --> 17:27.678
This here is
the struggle of the races--
man's inhumanity to man.

17:27.746 --> 17:31.281
Yet through it all,
the shining hope of
a new brotherhood. See ?

17:38.757 --> 17:42.159
The girl has gone berserk.

17:42.226 --> 17:44.862
I'm all alone here.

17:44.929 --> 17:48.431
I'm all alone in this house !

17:48.499 --> 17:52.102
Isn't anybody else interested
in upholdin' standards ?

17:52.170 --> 17:55.438
Our world is
comin' crumblin' down.

17:55.506 --> 17:57.808
The coons are comin'.

18:00.945 --> 18:03.480
Archie, 12% of the population
is black.

18:03.548 --> 18:05.615
There should be a lot
of black families
living out here.

18:05.684 --> 18:08.585
Yeah, this is only
a beginning, but I
think it's wonderful.

18:08.653 --> 18:11.922
Wonderful, huh ?
Well, let's see
how wonderful it is...

18:11.990 --> 18:15.258
When the watermelon rinds
come flyin' out the window !

18:23.168 --> 18:25.402
I need an aspirin.

18:25.469 --> 18:27.571
Where will I find one ?

18:27.638 --> 18:31.374
In the musical beer Stein
in our bedroom.

18:33.344 --> 18:36.613
Ma, how do you feel
about the new neighbors ?

18:36.681 --> 18:40.283
I mean, you never
told us how you feel
about black people.

18:41.720 --> 18:44.654
Well, you sure gotta
hand it to 'em.

18:44.723 --> 18:50.160
I mean, two years ago
they was nothin' but
servants and janitors.

18:50.228 --> 18:54.664
Now they're teachers
and doctors and lawyers.

18:54.733 --> 18:57.500
They've come
a long way on tv.

How's it going, Mike ?

19:07.178 --> 19:09.446
Here's last week's cleaning.
Thank you.

19:09.513 --> 19:12.015
I would've had it yesterday,
but it's been a frantic week.
That's all right.

19:12.083 --> 19:16.419
Things are getting a little
frantic around here too.
I'll put 'em upstairs.

19:16.487 --> 19:18.622
Hey, listen--
Lionel, have you heard
the good news ?

19:18.689 --> 19:21.158
No, but I've got some
good news of my own.

19:21.226 --> 19:25.262
Lionel, we're having
a black family for neighbors.
They bought Jim bowman's place.

19:25.329 --> 19:30.000
For $26,000-- 5,000 down
on a 20-year mortgage.

19:30.068 --> 19:34.604
- How did you know ?
- 'Cause we move in next week.

19:34.672 --> 19:37.074
Your folks
bought the place ?
You're the one ?

19:37.142 --> 19:39.709
That's right.
Lionel !
Hey, great !

19:39.778 --> 19:44.047
That's fantastic !
Congratulations ! Gee, I can't
wait to see Archie's reaction.

19:44.115 --> 19:46.984
I can't either !
Hey, mom ! Daddy !
I want to see that too.

19:47.051 --> 19:50.053
It's Lionel !
[ Archie ]
Lionel ? Is Lionel down there ?

19:50.121 --> 19:53.056
Yes, he is !
Hang onto him !
Don't let him get away !

19:53.124 --> 19:55.058
I got somethin'
to say to him.

19:55.126 --> 19:57.060
Archie,
you gotta hear--
wait till you hear.

19:57.128 --> 19:59.062
Just a minute,
just a minute.

19:59.130 --> 20:02.699
The two of youse
go over there to the couch and
do somethin' with yourselves.

20:02.767 --> 20:05.635
I gotta talk to Lionel.
Come on over here, Lionel.

20:05.703 --> 20:09.907
Sit down on that chair.
This is very important.
[ Clears throat ]

20:09.974 --> 20:15.078
Now, Lionel,
you and I been friends
a long time, right ?

20:15.146 --> 20:17.681
Right.
It's on the basis
of that friendship...

20:17.748 --> 20:20.184
I'm gonna ask you
to do me a favor.
Sure.

20:20.251 --> 20:22.953
Jim bowman,
our neighbor down the way,

20:23.021 --> 20:26.356
just sold his home
to a family of coloreds.

No !

Two doors away.
Can you believe it ?
Does Mike know about this ?

20:34.765 --> 20:38.435
Yeah, he knows about it.
All he can say is 12% of the
neighborhood ought to be black.

20:38.502 --> 20:40.437
Twelve percent ?
Aw, no.

20:40.504 --> 20:42.940
If you followed
that kind of thinkin',

20:43.007 --> 20:45.508
88% of the Harlem globetrotters
oughta be white.

20:56.354 --> 20:58.521

21:02.327 --> 21:04.328

many of your black people
are fine, decent people,
as you probably know.

21:08.499 --> 21:10.968
Yeah, so I've heard.

21:11.035 --> 21:14.437
But they'd be
more comfortable
somewhere else.
Right.

21:14.505 --> 21:17.107
They'd be happier
with their own kind.

21:17.175 --> 21:19.476
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

21:19.543 --> 21:21.644
Now, listen, this is
what we're gonna do.

21:21.712 --> 21:24.348
A group of
concerned neighbors
has got together...

21:24.415 --> 21:26.950
And we're gonna
take up a collection...

21:27.018 --> 21:30.320
To buy that house back
from them people who
bought it from bowman.

don't want to sell ?

a $2,000 profit !

Isn't that nice ?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.

21:40.098 --> 21:42.432
So why should they turn down
a $2,000 profit...

21:42.500 --> 21:44.935
In order to stay
in a neighborhood
where they ain't wanted ?

21:45.003 --> 21:48.038
And you're gonna tell 'em
they ain't wanted.
Oh, no, Lionel.

21:48.106 --> 21:52.042
You can't go up to people
and say a thing like that.
I mean, this is America.

21:57.215 --> 21:59.449
That's what
I want you to do.

I want you to take them
the offer, see ?

22:04.923 --> 22:08.225
I mean,
I could do it myself,
but for this job, uh,

you got the best

See, now, not that
I'm gonna ask you
to do it for nothin'.

You bring this thing off,
there's gonna be a little
somethin' in it for yourself.

22:16.667 --> 22:19.569
Yeah ? And I'd be doin' it
for their own good too.

22:19.637 --> 22:21.571
Of course.
That's what I'm sayin'.

22:21.639 --> 22:25.008
They ain't gonna be happy here.
What are they gonna do
for recreation ?

There ain't a crap game
