- I guess because my feet are
bigger than the boots.

08:51.398 --> 08:54.266
Or maybe because the boots are
smaller than my feet.

08:54.334 --> 08:56.868

to take a selfie.

08:56.937 --> 08:58.703

in so much trouble.

- Yeah.

You never should've
let me unlock that case.

Hey, boss.

Okay, this isn't working.

Ugh, we got to get Owen out

Hello, Owen?

10:06.073 --> 10:08.273
This is Margaret

10:08.342 --> 10:10.375
I'm calling from Hickory
Village to let you know

10:10.444 --> 10:12.210
that you've won our ultimate

10:14.114 --> 10:15.680
A generous sampler basket

10:15.749 --> 10:18.984
featuring two 5-ounce
hickory smoked summer sausages,

10:19.052 --> 10:21.920
6 ounces
of dry aged Genoa salami,

10:21.989 --> 10:24.089
and an assortment
of 17 cheeses,

10:24.157 --> 10:26.191
including a creamy aged
Wisconsin cheddar

10:26.259 --> 10:27.892
and a Montasio.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.895
Anywho, you have five minutes
to get to our store

10:30.964 --> 10:34.299
and claim your gift or we're
giving it to someone else.

10:34.368 --> 10:36.301
- There's no way Owen's gonna
fall for that.

10:36.370 --> 10:39.104
- Guys, I just won a gift
basket from Hickory Village!

10:39.172 --> 10:41.106
I'll be right back!

10:41.174 --> 10:44.275
- Never underestimate the power
of cheese.

10:44.344 --> 10:46.978
- Hey, Ruby, did Milo find out
about the boots?

10:47.047 --> 10:48.580
Because--

10:48.648 --> 10:49.614
hello, Milo.

10:49.683 --> 10:51.016
- Hi.

10:51.084 --> 10:53.518
Yep,
I found out about the boots.

10:53.587 --> 10:56.354
- Hey, you're Amazonia
from the "Jungle War" series!

10:56.423 --> 10:57.756
You were just Jayna the Juror.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.691
- I like changing costumes.

10:59.760 --> 11:03.094
I kind of wish I didn't though.
This one's itchy.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.096
I think there are bugs
in my leaves.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.766
- Heyo!
So you said I should bring

11:07.834 --> 11:10.301
something to get the boots off,
so I brought this,

11:10.370 --> 11:12.037
Italian dressing.

11:12.105 --> 11:15.974
- Oh, that would be great--
if she had a salad on her foot.

11:16.043 --> 11:18.610
This isn't gonna work.
- We won't know until we try.

11:35.462 --> 11:38.329
- That is a lot
of Italian dressing.

11:43.837 --> 11:44.936

11:47.107 --> 11:49.274

that wouldn't work.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.276
- My friend, Margo,
tried Italian dressing

11:51.344 --> 11:53.411
that time I got stuck
in a chimney.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.746
It didn't work then either.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.414
- Here!
Use this.

11:56.483 --> 11:59.217
It's a boot remover.
I get boots stuck all the time.

11:59.286 --> 12:00.819
This always gets them
right off.

12:00.887 --> 12:04.089
- Why didn't you show us this
first?

12:04.157 --> 12:07.058
- I was curious to see
if the Italian dressing worked.

12:07.127 --> 12:08.660
- Thank you.

12:12.132 --> 12:15.233
[straining]

12:15.302 --> 12:16.968
- It worked!
- Easy.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.770
- Told ya!

12:18.839 --> 12:20.805
- Now, we just have
to get all the salad dressing

12:20.874 --> 12:21.940
off this boot.

12:25.378 --> 12:26.845
Least there's not a lot of it.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.720
- Hey!
There's my smart watch.

- But now it smells weird.

12:48.802 --> 12:52.637
- Yeah, like a combo of garlic,
vinegar, olive oil,

12:52.706 --> 12:53.805
basil, salt--

12:53.874 --> 12:56.641

to make the boots smell better.

13:30.343 --> 13:31.609
- I know!

13:31.678 --> 13:33.044
We'll rub
the good-smelling boot

13:33.113 --> 13:34.512
on the bad-smelling boot,

13:34.581 --> 13:36.581

with it.

that was, like, ten seconds.

13:51.998 --> 13:53.965
- I'll go get
some spaghetti sauce.

have to take 'em back.
