00:30.489 --> 00:32.466
Please! You've got the wrong guy!

00:34.117 --> 00:35.552
You've got the wrong guy!

00:37.204 --> 00:38.955
Look, you've got the wrong guy!

00:38.956 --> 00:39.973
Please!

00:41.291 --> 00:42.809
You've got the wrong guy.

00:46.004 --> 00:47.463
You've got the wrong guy.

00:54.638 --> 00:57.074
- What...
- You think I wouldn't find out, fool?

00:57.683 --> 00:59.368
Oh, I got <i> ojos</i> everywhere.

00:59.810 --> 01:02.788
- Twenty-four-seven, 365.
- What are you talking about?

01:10.279 --> 01:11.279
'Sup, bitch?

01:11.780 --> 01:14.782
We know you kissed Olivia.
Why you got to do us like that, huh?

01:14.783 --> 01:16.385
Hey, I... I...

01:23.292 --> 01:26.645
- Why are you here?
- I just wanted to be included. Bitch!

01:27.045 --> 01:29.547
- We can talk this out.
- It's too late for talking.

01:29.548 --> 01:30.881
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

01:30.882 --> 01:34.027
I'm gonna give you a face for radio.
Mess him up.

01:34.386 --> 01:37.155
No. No, no, no, no.

01:37.848 --> 01:39.658
It was a mistake. I'm sorry!

01:40.017 --> 01:43.936
No. No. No. No. No.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.622
No!

01:49.818 --> 01:51.461
I got to get this on lockdown.

01:57.743 --> 01:58.743
What's up?

02:00.495 --> 02:02.747
- You look fried.
- Couldn't sleep last night.

02:02.748 --> 02:05.475
I'd seriously consider
Tempur-Pedic pillows. Changed my life.

02:06.335 --> 02:08.502
Or are we talking non-pillow issues?

02:08.502 --> 02:12.256
- Just some shit. It's nothing.
- Is it drugs? You slinging?

02:12.257 --> 02:13.775
You stole a car?

02:14.259 --> 02:15.593
Held up a liquor store?

02:15.594 --> 02:17.470
- A drug store? A corner store?
- No store.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.847
Home invasion? Assault?
Assault with a deadly weapon?

02:19.848 --> 02:21.724
Oh, my God, they made you
kill someone, didn't they?

02:21.725 --> 02:22.868
Shh.

02:25.187 --> 02:27.271
I really hope it wasn't a white person.

02:27.272 --> 02:28.707
I didn't kill anyone.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.485
- I kissed Olivia.
- What?

02:32.486 --> 02:34.463
- You kissed Olivia?
- Shh.

02:35.113 --> 02:37.907
Why tell me that?
You know I can't keep a secret.

02:37.908 --> 02:40.159
I call bullshit. You've kept
the football secret for months now.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.430
Unless you all of a sudden developed
glaucoma or became a pirate.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.707
That's not funny. Piracy's a problem.

02:46.708 --> 02:49.085
And... And...
And I'm cool with my own secrets.

02:49.086 --> 02:52.171
Other people's? I've
got nine hours tops.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.131
And that's with perfect conditions.

02:54.132 --> 02:57.093
If there are any extenuating
circumstances, all bets are off.

02:57.094 --> 03:00.388
I can't be too hungry or too full
or too hot or too cold

03:00.389 --> 03:01.972
or feel physically cornered.

03:01.973 --> 03:04.475
And what about Olivia?
She lives with Ruby.

03:04.476 --> 03:06.102
She could tell him at any moment.

03:06.103 --> 03:08.330
Olivia's cool. She's tight-lipped.

03:08.855 --> 03:11.917
- You boned?
- I'm talking about the lips on her face.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.252
And we're in the middle of a heat wave.

03:15.278 --> 03:17.797
- There's no way I can keep this in.
- Fine, I'll handle it.

03:18.615 --> 03:19.740
What are you doing?

03:19.741 --> 03:22.677
You don't deliver heartbreak via text!
You have to do it in person.

03:26.623 --> 03:27.682
Ooh.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.227
You'll thank me later.

03:34.256 --> 03:35.548
Hey.

03:35.549 --> 03:38.276
Wow. You look... not good.

03:39.970 --> 03:43.472
I'm sorry. I take full responsibility. I
shouldn't have blown you up every night.

03:43.473 --> 03:46.434
And I promise I'll stop talking about
the woman who may be my mom.

03:46.435 --> 03:49.145
Oh, did I tell you? I found her
on Facebook, but her account's private.

03:49.146 --> 03:52.440
I haven't friended her yet,
but I Googled her. She's an author.

03:52.441 --> 03:54.442
Do you think that's a sign
or just a coincidence?

03:54.443 --> 03:56.193
I don't know, but listen,
something's been weighing on me.

03:56.194 --> 03:57.295
I know.

03:59.156 --> 04:01.007
- You do?
- Yeah.

04:02.993 --> 04:06.245
And I'm in. I'm ready to take things
to the next level with us.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.807
I can't keep our sitch a secret.
It's eating me up.

04:09.583 --> 04:10.541
I feel you.

04:10.542 --> 04:13.395
We have to figure out a way to tell
the guys so they won't get pissed.

04:15.422 --> 04:16.630
- Hey.
- What's up?

04:16.630 --> 04:18.382
Nothing. Nothing's up.

04:18.382 --> 04:20.151
- Can I borrow Monse for a sec?
- No!

04:22.012 --> 04:25.198
No need to borrow her. She's all yours.

04:44.910 --> 04:45.910
- Everything cool?
- No!

04:45.911 --> 04:48.013
- We good?
- I've been played.

04:49.998 --> 04:51.485
Jasmine suckered Olivia
into hanging out

04:51.486 --> 04:53.042
after school and Olivia
just suckered me.

04:53.043 --> 04:55.312
Can you believe that?
I got double suckered.

04:56.254 --> 04:58.565
That sucks.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.351
What the hell, man?
You can't roll up on me like that.

05:10.352 --> 05:11.727
I'm letting you borrow my watch.

05:11.728 --> 05:14.396
It's synced with my phone timer.
Tick-tock!

05:14.397 --> 05:17.751
The time is ticking, so you better
start talking. He's coming this way.

05:18.860 --> 05:19.860
What's up?

05:20.737 --> 05:22.029
Uh...

05:22.030 --> 05:23.572
- So, Olivia...
- No!

05:23.573 --> 05:25.449
- No?
- I'm done talking about her.

05:25.450 --> 05:28.244
I'm over getting rejected.
It's called self-respect.

05:28.245 --> 05:30.871
So, from now on,
I'm only into girls who are into me.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.015
Hey!

05:32.791 --> 05:34.309
And who don't scare me.

05:35.085 --> 05:37.687
Between us,
I'm actually not even into girls.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.148
I mean... right now.

05:40.549 --> 05:42.675
I'm tired of being one-note.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.927
I gotta give this whole
"all about a girl" thing a break

05:44.928 --> 05:47.179
and focus on being a titan of industry

05:47.180 --> 05:49.723
so that when I'm ready to be
all about a girl again,

05:49.724 --> 05:51.284
I have the appropriate capital.

05:51.601 --> 05:54.228
- And I have an idea for a business.
- What's the idea?

05:54.229 --> 05:57.356
It's huge. I mean, so huge
that I can't talk about it here.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.084
Don't want to get Winklevoss-ed.

05:59.651 --> 06:01.819
Okay, fine, here's the
idea: it's an app.

06:01.820 --> 06:04.673
Online Live Interactive
Video Integration Application.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.366
That's all I can say for now.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.927
Jamal, come over after school.

06:09.286 --> 06:12.496
Cesar, no offense, but this
doesn't fall into your skill set.

06:12.497 --> 06:16.559
- I have an A minus in computer science.
- Exactly. And I have an A.

06:19.671 --> 06:21.338
My job is done. He's over her.

06:21.339 --> 06:25.318
He's over her?
Then what is this acronym for?

06:26.052 --> 06:28.554
Olivia. Damn, he's not over her.

06:28.555 --> 06:29.555
No shit, Cholock!

06:29.556 --> 06:32.266
And now I'm supposed to go over
to his house after school!

06:32.267 --> 06:33.851
- I can't be alone with him.
- You won't be alone.

06:33.852 --> 06:35.644
I'll tell him about the kiss
before you get there.

06:35.645 --> 06:39.273
- Then why do need to show?
- I need you for post-convo damage control.

06:39.274 --> 06:41.292
You're right.
I'm better with Ruby when he cries.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.986
But you have to promise
you're gonna get there first.

06:43.987 --> 06:45.529
Nothing can stop me.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.446
Go whack out those tags.
Keep your head

06:47.447 --> 06:49.491
on a swivel. Prophets
have been trolling.

06:49.492 --> 06:53.179
Yeah, cool. I just got to stop
by Ruby's first and sort some shit out.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.475
Or I'll knock this out first.

07:07.385 --> 07:10.304
Jamal! Could you put your phone down
for two minutes?

07:10.305 --> 07:12.097
I'm talking
about a billion-dollar idea here.

07:12.098 --> 07:14.284
I'm texting Cesar.
He should be here by now.

07:15.185 --> 07:17.996
- Damn it. He doesn't have a phone.
- Did you invite Cesar?

07:18.647 --> 07:19.897
- No. You did.
- No...

07:19.898 --> 07:23.692
I was pretty explicit in my directive.
I said, "Jamal, come over after school."

07:23.693 --> 07:24.735
Not Jamal and Cesar.

07:24.736 --> 07:28.131
In fact, I'm pretty clear I told Cesar
this didn't fall in his skill set.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.632
I didn't hear you say that.

07:31.618 --> 07:34.119
<i>Cesar, no offense, but this
doesn't fall into your skill set.</i>

07:34.120 --> 07:36.205
Why are you recording our conversations?

07:36.206 --> 07:39.333
For any future litigation.
We have to be prepared to defend our IP.

07:39.334 --> 07:40.334
I don't think that's legal.

07:40.335 --> 07:42.503
You have to have two-party consent
to record conversations.

07:42.504 --> 07:43.730
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

07:45.090 --> 07:47.275
Great. Just got your consent.

08:03.441 --> 08:05.168
I didn't say you could do that.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.175
Oh. Yes!

08:15.662 --> 08:17.138
Yo, what size are you?

08:18.123 --> 08:19.390
Oh, honey, no.

08:20.542 --> 08:23.335
Well, excuse me for touching
the cherished chonies.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.630
I think it's pretty normal for people to
not want you to touch their underwear.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.048
Well, not if you're besties.

08:28.049 --> 08:31.176
Monse, I thought this bitch
was really gonna cramp our style,

08:31.177 --> 08:34.948
but Jasmonsolivia has
a really nice ring to it, doesn't it?

08:35.640 --> 08:38.808
I take no responsibility for this.
You were properly warned weeks ago.

08:38.809 --> 08:40.644
Everyone deserves a second chance.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.205
<i>Mira, mira!</i>

08:46.192 --> 08:47.418
Yes, right?

08:47.861 --> 08:49.153
It's good, right?

08:49.154 --> 08:50.738
Yas, kween.

08:50.739 --> 08:54.634
- Your body, your choice.
- I think it might be a little tight.

08:55.410 --> 08:59.830
Monse, you are last person
who should be giving out fashion advice.

08:59.831 --> 09:02.332
I mean, look at you...
in that doo-doo outfit.

09:02.333 --> 09:05.228
Girl, why you trying
to be comfortable all the time?

09:05.503 --> 09:08.106
Sometimes it's okay
to leave your dignity at home.

09:09.716 --> 09:13.236
Pop them titties. Pop them titties.
Pop, pop, pop them titties.

09:13.553 --> 09:18.390
So, Olivia, how's living with Ruby?
He take a lot of showers?

09:18.391 --> 09:19.767
Follow my lead.

09:19.768 --> 09:22.561
Oh, yeah, Ruby loves to get sudsy.

09:22.562 --> 09:27.024
Nice. Because you got to get clean
before you get dirty. Mmm.

09:27.025 --> 09:30.069
So, tell me, does he ever
loofah your choofa?

09:30.070 --> 09:32.154
Or teeter-totter your tatas? Huh?

09:32.155 --> 09:34.948
No. But let's just say a shower cap

09:34.949 --> 09:37.576
isn't only for the hair on top,
if you know what I mean.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.079
Ugh, I can't wait
to show him my shower curtains.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.556
What else does he like?

09:42.916 --> 09:44.208
Um...

09:44.209 --> 09:47.228
You've been asking
a lot of questions about Ruby.

09:47.712 --> 09:51.048
It almost seems like you're more
interested in gathering intel on him

09:51.049 --> 09:52.317
than hanging out with us.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.384
No. I mean...

09:54.385 --> 09:56.553
Well, I mean,
I am interested in Ruby, but...

09:56.554 --> 09:59.848
So, you admit it.
He's the only reason why you're here.

09:59.849 --> 10:02.160
No! I like you guys too.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.353
Sometimes. Yeah.

10:04.354 --> 10:06.188
Olivia, wasn't it
Jasmine's idea to hang out?

10:06.189 --> 10:08.607
And wasn't it Jasmine
who suggested we come to your house,

10:08.608 --> 10:10.943
which happens to be where Ruby showers?

10:10.944 --> 10:12.128
Convenient.

10:12.987 --> 10:14.130
And hurtful.

10:14.572 --> 10:16.365
I really don't like being used.

10:16.366 --> 10:18.909
I think it would just be better
if you gave us our space.

10:18.910 --> 10:21.870
Guys, I am not using you.

10:21.871 --> 10:27.084
Agh. But... I can see
how bad this looks, so I'm gonna go.

10:27.085 --> 10:31.814
No, you don't need to leave. Just stand
in the hall and reflect on your actions.

10:35.051 --> 10:36.152
Are you su...

10:36.845 --> 10:37.845
I'll just...

10:40.265 --> 10:42.891
- You're good.
- Don't touch a bitch's chonies.

10:42.892 --> 10:44.661
I feel like my brain got dry humped.

10:45.353 --> 10:46.371
One sec.

10:46.896 --> 10:47.896
Ah!

10:48.940 --> 10:51.668
- That's 15 more minutes.
- I deserve 20.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.111
Hmm?

10:55.655 --> 10:57.465
I'm... I'm sorry.

10:59.117 --> 11:00.367
I'm scared for Ruby.

11:00.368 --> 11:02.470
Ruby would appreciate that. And a handy.

11:03.037 --> 11:05.205
No pressure, but if you ever find
yourself with time on your hands...

11:05.206 --> 11:06.849
Ah... Moving on.

11:08.710 --> 11:11.646
Okay, so if not Ruby,
then who would you be into?

11:12.505 --> 11:14.482
I don't know. What about you?

11:15.216 --> 11:16.216
No one.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.319
I don't believe that.

11:20.096 --> 11:23.783
Well, maybe there's one guy.

11:29.272 --> 11:31.690
- Yo. Yo, hey, come here.
- Yo, dog.

11:31.691 --> 11:32.709
Get him!

11:34.777 --> 11:37.130
Get your ass over here. Get back here.

11:38.448 --> 11:39.448
Get him!

11:42.243 --> 11:43.243
Yo!

11:58.468 --> 12:00.218
This is a business meeting

12:00.219 --> 12:03.513
and I'm starting to feel that you
don't have the mettle to be COO.

12:03.514 --> 12:05.515
I'm starting to feel
like you should be in an alleyway

12:05.516 --> 12:07.243
hosting a tea party for stray cats.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.478
- What?
- You're going crazy!

12:09.479 --> 12:12.314
And there is no app.
And since there's no app, I'm out.

12:12.315 --> 12:13.541
There is an app.

12:14.359 --> 12:15.901
Tell me the name again.

12:15.902 --> 12:19.297
Online Live Interactive
Video Integration Application.

12:23.493 --> 12:24.785
What are the odds?

12:24.786 --> 12:28.139
You're in deep. Deeper than I thought.

12:29.082 --> 12:32.542
I am. I'm drowning.
I don't know what to do.

12:32.543 --> 12:34.670
Do I give up? Do I try harder?

12:34.671 --> 12:36.213
Jamal, be my compass.

12:36.214 --> 12:37.798
Steer me in the right direction.

12:37.799 --> 12:40.759
Do you know anything
that could help me Oliviate... Agh!

12:40.760 --> 12:44.072
I mean, alleviate this obsession?

12:47.183 --> 12:49.017
Jasmine! Come!

12:49.018 --> 12:51.520
I can't. I'm on blast.

12:51.521 --> 12:54.791
I was kicking it with my bitches
when those bitches kicked me out.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.693
I guess I was all about the D.

12:57.694 --> 13:01.339
Oh, interesting. Ruby's having
a similar problem.<i> Sans</i> the D.

13:01.656 --> 13:05.343
He's making everything about a girl.
I'll leave you two to discuss.

13:05.827 --> 13:06.844
Screw this.

13:07.286 --> 13:10.556
Cesar's not here. I'm out of here.
I don't need this.

13:23.928 --> 13:25.429
Someone shot one of the homies.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.431
Have you seen Cesar?
He ain't answering his phone.

13:27.432 --> 13:28.449
His phone ain't working.

13:28.891 --> 13:31.619
Not that anyone broke it or anything.
It just died...

13:32.186 --> 13:33.353
of natural causes.

13:33.354 --> 13:34.855
If you see him,
tell him I'm looking for him.

13:34.856 --> 13:35.897
Yes, sir.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.323
I'm still going.

13:45.324 --> 13:47.576
I just wanted
to give Oscar some lead time.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.120
One-time!

13:51.330 --> 13:54.499
<i>This is L.A.P.D.
This block is on lockdown.</i>

13:54.500 --> 13:57.562
<i>For your safety,
remain inside until further advised.</i>

14:02.675 --> 14:03.592
<i>What?</i>

14:03.593 --> 14:08.281
I said, I can't believe we're stuck
in the house with Oscar.

14:13.227 --> 14:15.687
Ma! Yeah, I'm safe.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.081
No, I'm inside.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.333
I'm not gonna starve.

14:20.943 --> 14:22.378
We can make do.

14:24.739 --> 14:27.449
Can I get you anything?
Water? Coffee? Tea?

14:27.450 --> 14:28.551
Personal space.

14:29.577 --> 14:30.577
Seriously.

14:34.749 --> 14:37.030
Yo, why you so close to me?
There's like five other seats.

14:37.752 --> 14:40.712
I wanted to ask you something...
if that's okay.

14:40.713 --> 14:44.216
But if it's not okay, I don't need to
ask, even though I'm dying to know.

14:44.217 --> 14:47.094
But I don't need to die.
Not that you'd kill me, but you could.

14:47.095 --> 14:48.821
If I say yes, will you shut up?

14:51.349 --> 14:53.892
Do you know who Lil' Ricky is?

14:53.893 --> 14:57.538
Which Lil' Ricky? You talking about
Baby Ricky's daddy or Tiny Ricky's son?

15:00.983 --> 15:02.067
Ricardo Galindo.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.254
Ah, Lil' Ricky.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.533
What you want with Lil' Ricky?
He's the original <i> veterano.</i>

15:09.534 --> 15:11.052
The OV.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.513
- It doesn't work that way.
- My bad.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.225
Is there anything you could tell me?

15:19.544 --> 15:20.544
Do I scare you?

15:20.920 --> 15:22.230
Yeah.

15:23.047 --> 15:24.565
- Well, he scares me.
- Okay, bye.

15:25.591 --> 15:29.136
My parents are stuck, which sucks
'cause they were on a Costco run.

15:29.137 --> 15:32.990
- There's no snacks in the house.
- But... if I don't have snacks...

15:33.558 --> 15:36.202
- Tell me you have snacks in your purse.
- Boo, you know I do.

15:37.228 --> 15:40.623
It's egg salad, but... it's warm.

15:42.984 --> 15:44.043
I'll take it.

15:49.323 --> 15:50.657
Aw.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.552
Why are you eating that?

15:53.703 --> 15:55.221
For the greater good.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.307
Is that the sandwich?

15:59.333 --> 16:01.168
No, it's me.

16:01.169 --> 16:03.336
I got the egg booty coughs.

16:03.337 --> 16:05.856
- Oh, I swear to God, if you don't go away!
- Okay.

16:06.841 --> 16:08.592
She went into my room, didn't she?

16:12.722 --> 16:14.347
Where can I take this?

16:14.348 --> 16:16.075
There's no one in the bathroom.

16:16.392 --> 16:17.392
<i>¿Qué onda?</i>

16:26.903 --> 16:28.713
Freeze. Put your hands up.

16:35.786 --> 16:39.623
Okay, so you've been smashual
with this dude since summer

16:39.624 --> 16:41.291
and now you want to go legit?

16:41.292 --> 16:43.001
Go legit. What's the worst
that can happen?

16:43.002 --> 16:45.670
The guys could stop talking to me,
and our dynamic could change.

16:45.671 --> 16:47.214
We've been super tight
since fourth grade.

16:47.215 --> 16:50.192
You're telling me none of them
have ever had a girlfriend?

16:51.511 --> 16:53.094
Cesar's never had a girlfriend?

16:53.095 --> 16:55.597
Maybe once in sixth grade,
but since then...

16:55.598 --> 16:57.807
I don't know, he doesn't talk
about that stuff with me.

16:57.808 --> 16:59.768
What about Ruby?
What if Ruby got a girlfriend?

16:59.769 --> 17:02.663
Yes! God, yes.
He'd probably unclench a little.

17:04.106 --> 17:06.125
Maybe that's what they say about you.

17:07.443 --> 17:08.568
You implying I'm uptight?

17:08.569 --> 17:10.945
No, but you just tend to overthink.

17:10.946 --> 17:13.323
'Cause I don't have anyone
to talk this guy stuff out with!

17:13.324 --> 17:16.076
- All my friends are dudes.
- And it's just you and your dad, right?

17:16.077 --> 17:17.136
Yeah.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.388
Where is your mom?

17:21.207 --> 17:22.223
Don't know.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.268
She left when I was little.

17:25.419 --> 17:27.127
This is now becoming a sad-fest, so...

17:27.128 --> 17:29.649
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

17:30.466 --> 17:32.926
It's just kind of complicated right now
in the mom front,

17:32.927 --> 17:35.637
which probably explains why I haven't
ever rolled easy with the girls.

17:35.638 --> 17:39.057
What are you talking about?
You're totally a girl's girl.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.559
Okay, you're 5150,

17:40.560 --> 17:42.936
'cause I'm pretty sure being
a girl's girl means having girlfriends.

17:42.937 --> 17:45.748
- I've never had a real girlfriend before.
- Until now.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.486
So, as your real girlfriend,

17:51.487 --> 17:55.782
I think you need to stop worrying
about what the guys will or won't say

17:55.783 --> 17:59.160
and don't be afraid
to bring this mystery dude around

17:59.161 --> 18:00.846
and introduce him to the crew.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.050
- Or do they already know him?
- They don't!

18:03.958 --> 18:06.585
But if they did,

18:06.586 --> 18:09.466
do you think that they'd care that I
kept our sitch a secret for so long?

18:09.714 --> 18:12.566
- So, they do know him?
- No! No, no. No.

18:13.050 --> 18:14.509
That's not what I meant.

18:14.510 --> 18:18.096
Okay, I'm done sitting on the hot seat.
Your turn. You feeling anyone at school?

18:19.140 --> 18:21.391
- I don't kiss and tell.
- You kissed someone?

18:21.392 --> 18:22.868
There's a lockdown outside.

18:23.978 --> 18:25.103
We know. We can hear.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.104
Okay. Cool.

18:27.189 --> 18:29.608
And also, if you're hungry,
there aren't any snacks.

18:29.609 --> 18:30.609
Got it.

18:30.901 --> 18:33.653
And also, you may want to fill up
on liquids since there's no food,

18:33.654 --> 18:35.029
but Oscar's taken over
the bathroom and I

18:35.030 --> 18:36.406
don't think he's coming
out anytime soon

18:36.407 --> 18:38.491
so you may want to dehydrate yourselves.

18:38.492 --> 18:40.243
Why is Cesar's brother here?

18:40.244 --> 18:42.555
Olivia, Cesar.

18:43.456 --> 18:47.101
I don't know anything about Cesar,
Olivia. Is it crazy hot in here?

18:47.627 --> 18:50.920
Yeah, we're in the middle of a
heat wave. Jamal, go get some ice.

18:50.921 --> 18:52.648
- So, who'd you kiss?
- Hey!

18:53.591 --> 18:54.775
Let's play a game.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.478
You can't turn the A/C up that high.
You're gonna blow the power.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.539
I need to regulate my body temperature.

19:08.898 --> 19:12.525
I have to pee so bad.
And I'm sprouting major turtle-head.

19:12.526 --> 19:14.587
Will someone tell Oscar
to get out of the bathroom?

19:14.904 --> 19:16.213
Go ahead.

19:17.573 --> 19:18.573
I'll hold it.

19:18.783 --> 19:22.202
What kind of games you wanna play?
You guys feeling words, pictures, cards?

19:22.203 --> 19:25.931
How about a game that reveals
your innermost feelings and secrets?

19:26.207 --> 19:27.916
Or... KerPlunk?

19:27.917 --> 19:29.852
How about Smash, Marry, Kill?

19:31.087 --> 19:32.212
Jamal!

19:34.173 --> 19:37.175
I think that was a sign
that we shouldn't play this game.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.302
- Can I talk to you in the kitchen?
- No, thanks.

19:39.303 --> 19:41.012
Jamal, if you come to the kitchen,

19:41.013 --> 19:43.491
- I'll show you where the snacks are.
- Coming.

19:46.143 --> 19:47.811
- Where are the snacks?
- There are no snacks.

19:47.812 --> 19:49.705
God damn it. Do you know
how messed up that is?

19:50.523 --> 19:53.316
Space. Space. I need space.
I can't be cornered like this.

19:53.317 --> 19:54.818
Hold on, I'm trying to
tell you something.

19:54.819 --> 19:56.778
And I'm trying not to
tell you something.

19:56.779 --> 19:58.255
You're not making any sense.

19:58.614 --> 20:00.257
- You don't want me to.
- Look.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.134
I'm just trying to say thanks.

20:02.743 --> 20:05.412
You got Olivia out of her room
to play a game with me.

20:05.413 --> 20:07.330
I appreciate you
for being such a good friend.

20:07.331 --> 20:08.873
Yeah. Hold on to that.

20:10.251 --> 20:11.251
Is it raining?

20:14.505 --> 20:15.648
It's not rain.

20:16.257 --> 20:18.717
What? Who knows how long
this is gonna take!

20:18.718 --> 20:21.195
- It could be all night.
- All night?

20:23.764 --> 20:27.910
Son, you're in deep. Real deep.

20:28.185 --> 20:31.455
- I had no choice.
- There's always a choice.

20:31.981 --> 20:33.165
Who are you protecting?

20:33.691 --> 20:37.235
'Cause I'll be honest with you,
your story doesn't make sense.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.879
I'm telling the truth.

20:39.488 --> 20:42.883
I want to believe you,
but I don't think you're that dumb.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.095
Are you that dumb?

20:47.663 --> 20:50.707
Why wouldn't Olivia tell Monse?

20:50.708 --> 20:53.501
Because Olivia said
that she keeps things private.

20:53.502 --> 20:57.606
You don't understand
anything about girls, do you?

20:58.340 --> 21:01.134
They don't even need
to know each other to talk about it.

21:01.135 --> 21:04.262
It's like they're transmitting this shit
telepathically all the time.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.973
- They are?
- It's like VagiFi.

21:06.974 --> 21:10.185
My ex-wife used to sync up
with my daughter.

21:10.186 --> 21:12.896
It's like their thoughts
would exchange automatically.

21:12.897 --> 21:15.291
I would come home,
my shit would be done.

21:16.066 --> 21:18.878
Your friend Jamal is not the wild card.

21:19.487 --> 21:20.838
It's Olivia.

21:22.406 --> 21:23.948
Can I use your phone?

21:23.949 --> 21:26.552
No. You don't do this over the phone.

21:27.077 --> 21:29.763
You lose the tone when
you use the phone.

21:31.081 --> 21:32.624
We got to get you there.

21:37.671 --> 21:39.756
Go, Ruby! We don't have all day.

21:39.757 --> 21:41.817
Actually, we do. We're locked in.

21:42.259 --> 21:45.845
I'm a gentleman, I make love.
I don't smash.

21:45.846 --> 21:47.597
Well then you're not doing it right,

21:47.598 --> 21:52.393
'cause if you want a girl to bow,
then you got to plow. Right, Olivia?

21:52.394 --> 21:55.080
Anyways, Make love, Marry, Kill.

21:55.147 --> 21:56.731
Maybe we should ixnay the urdermay.

21:56.732 --> 21:58.233
We don't wanna poke
the bear in the bathroom.

21:58.234 --> 22:01.152
No more rewrites, Jamal. I'll go first.
I'd kill Jasmine.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.488
- I deserve that.
- I'd make love to Ruby.

22:03.489 --> 22:06.741
That's really considerate,
just as I would be as a lover.

22:06.742 --> 22:08.827
- And then I'd marry Jamal.
- Seriously?

22:08.828 --> 22:10.787
Why not make love to me and marry Ruby?

22:10.788 --> 22:13.498
- We're married. We're having sex.
- What about the marital death bed?

22:13.499 --> 22:15.124
Fine. I'm changing my answer.

22:15.125 --> 22:17.544
I'd make love to Jamal and marry Ruby.
Happy?

22:17.545 --> 22:21.565
I am. Because even though we're married,
we're having sex, and a lot of it.

22:22.091 --> 22:23.424
She made me get clipped.

22:28.305 --> 22:29.847
Uh...

22:29.848 --> 22:31.283
You want to play?

22:33.185 --> 22:34.185
Okay.

22:35.479 --> 22:36.479
I'd kill you.

22:37.773 --> 22:38.874
I'd kill you.

22:40.526 --> 22:41.627
I'd smash you.

22:42.861 --> 22:44.171
I'd smash you.

22:48.325 --> 22:50.702
Fine. I'd smash you too.

22:50.703 --> 22:51.970
Then I'd kill you.

22:58.127 --> 22:59.269
Let's keep playing.

23:03.632 --> 23:05.383
I'd marry Olivia.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.969
Monse, you can be my side piece.
And I'd kill Jasmine.

23:07.970 --> 23:10.888
- All right, now it's starting to hurt.
- Okay, my turn.

23:10.889 --> 23:12.265
I'd make love to Monse.

23:12.266 --> 23:15.077
Excuse me. Can you say that slower?

23:15.978 --> 23:18.521
I'd make love to Monse.

23:19.523 --> 23:20.791
I'd marry Ruby.

23:21.775 --> 23:25.028
- And I'd kill Jasmine.
- All y'all can suck a bag of buttholes.

23:26.322 --> 23:28.156
Did you hear?
That's the sign I've been looking for.

23:28.157 --> 23:31.075
- A bag of buttholes?
- No, Olivia said she'd marry me.

23:31.076 --> 23:32.469
Is it an open marriage?

23:39.501 --> 23:41.437
I hate to break it to you,
you're not my type.

23:41.837 --> 23:44.422
Damn. There goes
my whole experimental phase.

23:44.423 --> 23:45.965
Lasted all of two minutes.

23:47.134 --> 23:51.071
But don't worry, I'm not crushed...
unless you kiss like Cesar.

23:51.972 --> 23:53.407
You kissed Cesar?

23:56.060 --> 23:58.821
On Halloween. But don't tell anyone,
I don't want things to get weird.

24:05.444 --> 24:06.503
You kissed Olivia?

24:09.239 --> 24:10.424
Damn.

24:13.410 --> 24:15.328
It wasn't me!

24:16.305 --> 24:22.896
