00:02.796 --> 00:07.008
The Chinese Water Torture Cell
was invented in 1911 by Harry Houdini.

00:11.346 --> 00:13.223
Nothing like
new material.

00:13.348 --> 00:15.600
He was lowered
head-first into the water.

00:15.725 --> 00:19.396
His ankles were locked
and bolted to the top of the tank.

00:20.230 --> 00:22.649
I'm going to need
a volunteer.

00:23.525 --> 00:24.734
Ooh! Ooh!

00:25.360 --> 00:28.655
The guy dislocating
his shoulder, right there.

00:28.780 --> 00:30.115
Could you tell the guy
next to you to come up?

00:30.240 --> 00:31.825
(ALL LAUGHING)

00:32.325 --> 00:34.577
Come on, get up there, man.
Get up there, man! Come on!

00:34.703 --> 00:36.162
(ALL APPLAUDING)

00:36.996 --> 00:38.415
Come on!

00:46.047 --> 00:47.590
- Hi, have we met before?
- No.

00:47.716 --> 00:49.968
See, if you'd said, "Yes,"
you could've gone back to your seat.

00:50.093 --> 00:53.805
Now, can you vouch for this audience
that this is a glass tank full of water?

00:53.930 --> 00:55.014
- Yeah.
- No, you can't.

00:55.140 --> 00:57.809
You haven't done
anything yet. Come on.

00:57.934 --> 00:59.227
Knock on the glass.

00:59.352 --> 01:01.271
Solid glass.
Knock on it.

01:01.688 --> 01:04.733
It's real water, too.
llana, splash the guy.

01:05.900 --> 01:07.610
- Does that feel wet to you?
- Yeah.

01:07.736 --> 01:10.029
And you think that proves it's water?
I think we have met.

01:10.155 --> 01:12.532
Do you know the public washroom behind
the truck stop east of Omaha?

01:12.657 --> 01:13.783
- No.
- See, if you'd said, "Yes,"

01:13.908 --> 01:16.119
that would have
been so funny.

01:16.536 --> 01:18.747
Hold out your
arms for me.

01:19.038 --> 01:21.040
- You've done this before, right?
- No.

01:21.166 --> 01:23.877
Again, two choices
and you went for the unfunny one.

01:40.643 --> 01:44.314
Now, remember. There's only one thing
you've got to be able to do.

01:44.439 --> 01:47.817
Drag a screaming, crying shackled man
out of a tank of water.

01:47.942 --> 01:48.902
Up!

01:56.701 --> 01:58.870
Hey, you can
swim, right?

01:59.996 --> 02:01.122
Tell me you can swim!

02:01.247 --> 02:02.707
Yeah.

02:02.832 --> 02:05.460
Two answers, man.
Two answers!

02:19.849 --> 02:22.060
Is that part
of the act?

02:22.185 --> 02:23.645
I'm new.
I think so.

02:25.980 --> 02:27.482
Maybe not.

02:28.983 --> 02:30.527
Get up here!

03:21.035 --> 03:22.078
Aw.

03:22.871 --> 03:26.249
Five eager doctors,
and no sick people.

03:26.374 --> 03:30.920
Let us try and fill
our spare time with a new challenge.

03:31.421 --> 03:32.714
The winner gets immunity...

03:32.881 --> 03:34.924
I've a sick guy.
I saw this magician last night...

03:35.049 --> 03:37.385
The girl's fine.
He didn't really cut her in half.

03:37.510 --> 03:40.054
His heart stopped while he was hanging
upside down in a water tank.

03:40.179 --> 03:43.433
A drowning man's heart stopped?
That is a mystery.

03:43.558 --> 03:46.477
Along with immunity,
the winner gets to nominate two...

03:46.603 --> 03:48.771
He lost consciousness
almost as soon as he hit the water.

03:48.897 --> 03:52.233
You have to leave work at 6:00 p.m.,
but you make time for man dates?

03:52.358 --> 03:53.401
What's the challenge?

03:53.526 --> 03:54.777
Are we not allowed
to be friends?

03:54.944 --> 03:57.155
I'm just hurt. When I asked you
to come see <i>Mamma Mia...</i>

03:57.322 --> 03:59.365
No history of heart disease,
no angina, no...

03:59.490 --> 04:00.491
He's lying.-

04:00.617 --> 04:01.826
About his history?
ER confirmed...

04:01.993 --> 04:04.203
About everything. He's a magician.
That's what they do.

04:04.329 --> 04:07.248
He screwed up the trick, started
drowning and he got a cardiac arrest.

04:07.373 --> 04:09.876
You were talking
about a challenge?

04:10.001 --> 04:13.588
The winner nominates
two of your competitors.

04:14.505 --> 04:16.674
I will fire
one of them.

04:19.802 --> 04:20.845
Even if he
was drowning,

04:20.970 --> 04:22.931
it would have taken longer to set off
a cardiac incident

04:23.056 --> 04:23.890
without some
underlying problem...

04:24.015 --> 04:26.017
Fine. Go run your tests.

04:26.142 --> 04:27.769
If you're wrong,
you're fired.

04:27.894 --> 04:28.811
If I'm right,
do I stay?

04:28.937 --> 04:32.482
If I say no, are you going
to let your patient die?

04:35.818 --> 04:36.736
What's the challenge?

04:36.903 --> 04:40.281
We can all applaud the doctor who's
willing to break all the rules.

04:40.406 --> 04:43.368
But the real hero
is the unsung doctor,

04:43.493 --> 04:47.872
toiling in anonymity, because he broke
the rules without getting caught.

04:48.081 --> 04:50.750
I need to know
you have these skills.

04:50.875 --> 04:52.335
I need you

04:53.169 --> 04:56.714
to bring me
the thong of Lisa Cuddy.

04:59.592 --> 05:01.052
Not kidding.

05:02.804 --> 05:04.472
Thong, Cuddy, go-

05:10.979 --> 05:12.855
It's how
I got hired.

05:16.734 --> 05:19.112
You're actually
considering this?

05:19.529 --> 05:22.323
If you want to stand on principle,
I really respect you for that.

05:22.448 --> 05:25.118
It's childish, unprofessional
and inappropriate.

05:25.243 --> 05:26.327
The job is
not worth it.

05:26.452 --> 05:30.707
We should all beg off, tell him
we failed, no winners, no losers.

05:31.666 --> 05:32.917
Fine.

05:33.793 --> 05:34.794
You're going to do it,
aren't you?

05:34.919 --> 05:36.754
Of course I'm going to do it.

05:40.299 --> 05:41.801
No valvular regurgitation,

05:41.926 --> 05:44.804
no wall motion abnormalities,
no other structural defects.

05:44.929 --> 05:47.765
If you didn't sound so despondent,
I'd say that was good news.

05:47.890 --> 05:50.226
It is for you,
not for him.

05:50.351 --> 05:52.520
Notice any heaviness in your legs
the last couple days?

05:52.645 --> 05:53.938
Why isn't it good
news for you?

05:54.063 --> 05:57.734
Because if there's nothing wrong
with you, he gets fired.

05:57.859 --> 06:00.236
- Seriously?
- Somewhat seriously. Your legs?

06:00.361 --> 06:01.988
Haven't noticed anything
out of the ordinary.

06:02.113 --> 06:05.408
- Shortness of breath?
- Would it help if I puked?

06:09.370 --> 06:10.705
Pick a card.

06:11.330 --> 06:13.708
- Any tightness in your chest or arms?
- Pick a card.

06:13.833 --> 06:14.792
You don't seem
too worried.

06:14.917 --> 06:16.169
Would you please
pick a card?

06:16.294 --> 06:18.379
Our boss thinks your cardiac arrest
was just a result

06:18.504 --> 06:20.256
of you accidentally drowning.

06:20.465 --> 06:23.760
Your boss is an idiot.
Put it back. Shuffle them up.

06:23.885 --> 06:25.636
So, then,
why aren't you worried?

06:25.762 --> 06:27.847
Either I'm dying
or I'm not.

06:27.972 --> 06:29.682
I mean, I don't want
the ride to be over,

06:29.807 --> 06:33.144
but unless worrying is some new form
of treatment...

06:34.479 --> 06:35.897
- Your card.
- No.

06:36.439 --> 06:38.858
I'm going to prep you
for a transesophageal echo.

06:38.983 --> 06:39.817
You sure you
shuffled these?

06:39.942 --> 06:41.986
And I'm going to
need to sedate you.

06:42.111 --> 06:44.739
Might wanna check
your wallet first.

06:45.448 --> 06:48.659
Would you check your wallet?
It's part of the trick.

06:51.496 --> 06:52.497
(EXCLAIMS)

06:57.710 --> 06:59.170
That's my card.
How did you do that?

06:59.295 --> 07:01.047
Do it again?

07:12.934 --> 07:14.852
- Thought you weren't playing.
- I'm not.

07:14.977 --> 07:16.229
She'll fire you
if she catches you.

07:16.395 --> 07:19.023
I don't think she can fire me
for not trying to steal her panties.

07:19.148 --> 07:20.441
You trying to
will them off?

07:20.775 --> 07:21.943
If I had a plan,

07:22.068 --> 07:25.446
the first part would be
not telling you what the plan was.

07:25.571 --> 07:27.198
You haven't touched
that coffee.

07:27.323 --> 07:28.407
Yes, I have.

07:28.533 --> 07:32.620
She can't keep her panties on
if they're wet. We work together.

07:32.787 --> 07:34.831
One wins,
protects the other.

07:34.956 --> 07:40.169
Or, I win by myself, and then you try
desperately to convince me to spare you.

07:44.298 --> 07:45.758
Dr. Cuddy!

07:45.883 --> 07:46.843
(TAUB AND AMBER EXCLAIM)

07:47.468 --> 07:49.178
Dr. Taub,
are you okay?

07:49.303 --> 07:51.097
I just tripped.
I'm so sorry.

07:51.222 --> 07:54.809
I have some extra time.
Do you need any help in the clinic?

07:54.934 --> 07:55.893
Okay-

08:02.191 --> 08:05.319
We found no apparent cause for the
arrest. TTE and TEE revealed no...

08:05.444 --> 08:08.030
Send the patient home.
You can give him a lift.

08:08.364 --> 08:10.324
We checked for clots,
we checked for...

08:10.449 --> 08:12.535
You're reporting to me because
you're scared to report to House,

08:12.660 --> 08:14.620
because you found nothing,
because this isn't a case.

08:14.745 --> 08:16.289
And you thought
I'd save your ass.

08:16.414 --> 08:17.665
Yeah.

08:19.083 --> 08:22.503
I thought he was sick.
What was I supposed to do?

08:23.629 --> 08:26.924
What about his lungs? Decreased oxygen
saturation leads to heart failure.

08:27.049 --> 08:28.926
- ER didn't find anything.
- ER wasn't looking.

08:29.051 --> 08:32.513
Too busy trying
to keep him alive. Get an MRI.

08:38.269 --> 08:39.103
<i>WOMAN: Clinic.</i>

08:39.228 --> 08:42.356
Yes, can you ask Dr. Cuddy to come
to the nurses' station? Stat.

08:42.481 --> 08:43.900
<i>Right away.</i>

09:03.252 --> 09:04.587
(FIRE ALARM RINGING)

09:08.841 --> 09:10.176
I asked you
to get Dr. Cuddy.

09:10.301 --> 09:12.678
Dr. Taub said
she'd be right out.

09:18.643 --> 09:22.605
A fungus in my lungs? How would I even
get something like that?

09:22.730 --> 09:24.815
Well, right now it's just a theory.
We don't even know if...

09:24.941 --> 09:26.817
God, I knew I shouldn't
have done those mushrooms in college.

09:26.943 --> 09:28.110
I'm sure there's
no connection.

09:28.236 --> 09:29.654
It was a joke.

09:29.779 --> 09:32.073
You really lose your sense of humor
when your job's on the line.

09:32.198 --> 09:34.951
Sorry. Most dying people
don't really like to...

09:36.202 --> 09:37.870
Not that you're dying.

09:37.995 --> 09:39.538
But a little sick
would be perfect?

09:39.664 --> 09:40.915
Yeah.

09:42.667 --> 09:44.210
(SCREAMING)

09:44.335 --> 09:46.003
My stomach!

09:46.128 --> 09:47.880
Stabbing or throbbing?

09:50.132 --> 09:51.467
Grey Turner's sign.
He's got internal bleeding.

09:51.592 --> 09:52.718
I'll call surgery.

09:53.594 --> 09:55.805
The surgeons have transfused
three units AB positive,

09:55.930 --> 09:57.390
but they're still
looking for the source of the bleed.

09:57.515 --> 10:00.309
No trauma. Could be liver disease,
vitamin K deficiency.

10:00.434 --> 10:03.104
Only thing we know
for sure it's not, nothing.

10:03.229 --> 10:05.189
And we would've noticed
something chronic like liver disease.

10:05.314 --> 10:07.984
It's probably an
intestinal infarct.

10:08.109 --> 10:09.527
No, I got it!

10:13.364 --> 10:14.865
(TAUB CLEARS THROAT)

10:16.075 --> 10:17.368
Eau de Cuddy.

10:17.493 --> 10:19.203
No way.
How did you get them?

10:19.328 --> 10:20.621
Only one way.

10:23.541 --> 10:25.001
These are not
Cuddy's panties.

10:25.126 --> 10:26.127
You don't
think that I...

10:26.252 --> 10:27.253
No.

10:27.378 --> 10:31.048
Also, she's wearing
a red bra today.

10:31.173 --> 10:32.967
Like I'm the only
one who noticed.

10:33.926 --> 10:36.012
Means that
the downstairs will match.

10:36.137 --> 10:38.139
Do your research, people.

10:38.264 --> 10:41.642
An intestinal infarct could be linked
to the cardiac arrest.

10:41.767 --> 10:42.977
Hike up your skirt.

10:43.102 --> 10:44.729
That's rude,
even for you.

10:44.854 --> 10:48.816
Hike it down then. You're wearing a
black bra. Let's see the underwear.

10:48.941 --> 10:50.026
No!

10:51.235 --> 10:53.154
You two cut a deal.

10:59.827 --> 11:03.247
If you're not cheating,
you're not trying hard enough.

11:03.372 --> 11:05.124
So, you're not
wearing any underwear?

11:05.249 --> 11:06.751
There's a guy bleeding...

11:06.876 --> 11:11.088
Foreman, she's not wearing any
underwear. You used to be more fun.

11:11.213 --> 11:13.049
She's not wearing
any underwear, big deal.

11:13.299 --> 11:15.843
When she stops wearing clothes, then we
can drop the medical stuff.

11:15.968 --> 11:17.261
Let me see the MRI film.

11:17.386 --> 11:18.637
We didn't get
any images.

11:18.763 --> 11:20.598
He started screaming
as soon as I turned it on.

11:20.723 --> 11:22.058
Define soon.

11:22.683 --> 11:25.436
I didn't even get
a chance to sit down.

11:26.729 --> 11:27.646
You guys ever wonder

11:28.606 --> 11:31.817
how he was going
to get out of that water tank?

11:31.942 --> 11:33.277
You, come.

11:42.870 --> 11:46.874
Lacerations in his digestive tract
and his spleen is shredded.

11:47.625 --> 11:49.960
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have nothing in my hands,

11:50.086 --> 11:51.837
nothing up my sleeve.

11:52.922 --> 11:54.715
I do have something
in my pants,

11:54.840 --> 11:56.884
but it's not going to help
with this particular trick.

11:57.009 --> 11:58.719
Watch closely.

12:01.430 --> 12:03.849
- How you been?
- Fine, 'til now.

12:08.270 --> 12:09.688
Ta-da!

12:10.481 --> 12:12.983
Now, you disappear.

12:20.616 --> 12:22.326
Look familiar?

12:22.785 --> 12:26.997
The MRI's magnet ripped this through
your intestine into your spleen.

12:27.123 --> 12:30.251
Forgot about that,
on account of almost dying.

12:31.836 --> 12:32.962
Where's Dr. Kutner?

12:33.087 --> 12:35.005
He's no longer
on your case.

12:35.131 --> 12:37.466
'Cause there's nothing
wrong with you.

12:37.591 --> 12:39.969
I didn't screw
up that trick.

12:40.428 --> 12:42.430
Everything that's happened
can be explained

12:42.555 --> 12:45.057
by you being forgetful
and incompetent.

12:45.182 --> 12:46.892
You screwed up,
you passed out...

12:47.017 --> 12:50.354
Know my favorite time to lie?
When my life hangs in the balance.

12:50.563 --> 12:52.982
Your life doesn't
hang in the balance.

12:53.107 --> 12:54.650
You know your life
doesn't hang in the balance.

12:54.775 --> 12:56.235
Your reputation
might hang...

12:56.360 --> 12:57.820
You ever do
magic as a kid?

12:58.154 --> 13:01.031
You seem like the type.
Lonely, obsessive...

13:01.157 --> 13:02.992
I outgrew it. You?

13:04.118 --> 13:05.244
Pick a card?

13:05.369 --> 13:07.913
Too much trouble.
Can I just pick my nose?

13:08.038 --> 13:09.540
I am not a hack.

13:11.792 --> 13:14.962
I tell you how it's done,
will you go home?

13:17.381 --> 13:21.302
Guess you're going to
make it magically appear in my wallet...

13:25.806 --> 13:27.558
You are a hack.

13:41.280 --> 13:42.948
I don't screw up.

13:53.626 --> 13:56.754
Nosebleed that major
means he's actually sick.

13:57.505 --> 14:00.382
Means the cardiac arrest
was a symptom.

14:00.758 --> 14:01.842
Stop gloating.

14:01.967 --> 14:02.968
I'm not gloating.

14:03.093 --> 14:04.220
Then what's that smirk?

14:04.345 --> 14:06.013
No smirk,
it's just how I look.

14:06.138 --> 14:07.515
What about
the underwear challenge?

14:07.640 --> 14:09.725
I declare it
officially on hold.

14:10.100 --> 14:12.269
Not really fair,
but I get it.

14:29.745 --> 14:30.871
It's Cuddy's.

14:30.996 --> 14:31.956
Pull down your pants.

14:32.081 --> 14:33.165
You think I'm lying?

14:33.582 --> 14:37.419
No, I want to give you a reward.
Yes, I think you're lying.

14:37.795 --> 14:40.256
Cardiac arrest
plus nosebleed. Go.

14:40.381 --> 14:43.842
Patient has no significant family
history, no angina, no prior attacks.

14:43.968 --> 14:45.344
What if isn't
his heart?

14:45.469 --> 14:46.845
What if it's
the vessels around his heart?

14:46.971 --> 14:50.516
Polyarteritis nodosa causes cardiac
symptoms and hypertension,

14:50.641 --> 14:51.475
which makes
his nose bleed.

14:51.684 --> 14:54.895
You know what else makes your nose bleed
and your heart race? Cocaine.

14:55.020 --> 14:57.022
Guy works in
a B-list nightclub in Atlantic City.

14:57.147 --> 15:00.025
He's got to be taking
regular rolls in the snow.

15:00.150 --> 15:02.736
You, take the gloater
to the patient's drug den.

15:02.861 --> 15:05.781
Make sure you pat down
his pockets before you leave.

15:05.906 --> 15:08.534
You and Big Love, biopsy a blood vessel
from around the heart.

15:08.659 --> 15:10.869
Test for
polyarteritis nodosa.

15:11.453 --> 15:13.956
You, in my office.

15:20.254 --> 15:21.755
Those aren't
my panties.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.173
I know.

15:24.133 --> 15:25.676
Hypothetical.

15:25.801 --> 15:29.054
A young woman does something
clumsy in public,

15:29.930 --> 15:34.393
and instead of laughing it off, she gets
irrationally upset. Explain.

15:35.352 --> 15:37.938
Maybe she's clumsy
'cause she's nervous

15:38.063 --> 15:41.108
'cause she forgot
to do her spelling homework.

15:41.233 --> 15:43.819
Well,
in my hypothetical, she's eight.

15:43.944 --> 15:48.240
This girl's not insecure.
Seems more like she's afraid.

15:49.074 --> 15:51.285
Do you have a point, or did you
just get a new book of riddles?

15:51.410 --> 15:53.245
I think you're hiding
a medical condition.

15:53.370 --> 15:54.747
I'm not.

15:54.872 --> 15:56.332
I'm glad we
had this talk.

15:56.665 --> 15:59.335
Doctors often try to ignore
their symptoms,

16:00.210 --> 16:02.379
because they
think they can't get sick.

16:02.504 --> 16:05.549
If you've got something going on,
I need you to take care of it.

16:05.674 --> 16:08.177
And I take your
compassion entirely at face value.

16:08.302 --> 16:10.846
It's not compassion. It's self-interest.
I want my team healthy.

16:10.971 --> 16:12.848
It's not
self-interest. It's curiosity.

16:13.307 --> 16:14.808
I dropped a file, House.

16:14.975 --> 16:19.438
I start bleeding from the eyes, I'll be
sure to make an appointment.

16:19.897 --> 16:21.482
Okay-

16:25.569 --> 16:27.488
- Well, found some pot.
- Bag it.

16:27.780 --> 16:29.323
I'm not sure it really
fits the symptoms.

16:29.448 --> 16:33.118
Of course not, but it'd be irresponsible
to leave it here.

16:35.120 --> 16:36.830
- You have a quarter?
- No.

16:36.955 --> 16:38.499
How did Cole get
those panties off Cuddy?

16:38.749 --> 16:41.794
They were never on her.
No way those are hers.

16:42.586 --> 16:43.587
Aha.

16:44.338 --> 16:45.339
Tularemia.

16:45.464 --> 16:46.799
No, he'd have
to have rabbits.

16:47.091 --> 16:50.636
True, maybe a tick
jumped from a rabbit

16:50.761 --> 16:54.473
and landed on one of these white,
fluffy alligators.

16:54.598 --> 16:56.558
Then it jumps
onto our patient,

16:56.684 --> 17:01.063
transfers the bacteria, causes
pericarditis, explains everything.

17:07.569 --> 17:09.488
What are you giving me?

17:09.613 --> 17:10.739
How'd you
do the trick?

17:11.990 --> 17:16.078
If I explain, it becomes mundane.
You lose the actual magic.

17:16.245 --> 17:18.205
What do you mean,
"The actual magic"?

17:18.330 --> 17:20.541
You think you're actually
sawing women in half?

17:20.666 --> 17:22.084
You going to
tell me what's wrong with me or not?

17:22.209 --> 17:26.213
Magic is cool.
Actual magic is oxymoronic.

17:27.297 --> 17:28.465
Might not even be oxy.

17:28.757 --> 17:31.927
You're not going
to tell me unless I tell you?

17:33.303 --> 17:34.805
You got a nurse
to plant the card.

17:34.930 --> 17:36.432
I can't get a nurse
to help me pee.

17:36.557 --> 17:38.183
You got a buddy
to plant the card.

17:38.308 --> 17:40.644
The fun is
in not knowing.

17:48.360 --> 17:50.237
The fun is in knowing.

17:53.407 --> 17:55.576
My head.
Oh, I've got a headache.

17:56.368 --> 17:57.327
How bad?
Is it new?

17:57.453 --> 17:58.579
It's not too bad.

17:58.704 --> 18:02.291
I'll just take one
of these Vicodin.

18:12.676 --> 18:15.220
You eat a lot of beets,
you have an electric toothbrush

18:15.345 --> 18:17.639
and you sleep less
than six hours a night.

18:17.765 --> 18:19.057
That's impressive.

18:19.183 --> 18:22.936
The red betamine from the beets stains
the plaque deposits on your teeth,

18:23.061 --> 18:25.397
which are then swirled
by your spinning toothbrush.

18:25.522 --> 18:28.066
Your heavy lids and
your prematurely aging skin

18:28.192 --> 18:30.194
tell me that you're
carrying a major sleep debt.

18:30.402 --> 18:32.029
That was way cooler
before you explained it.

18:32.154 --> 18:34.114
It was meaningless
until I explained it.

18:34.448 --> 18:38.285
People come to my show
because they want a sense of wonder.

18:39.036 --> 18:43.373
They want to experience
something that they can't explain.

18:43.499 --> 18:46.210
If the wonder's gone
when the truth is known,

18:46.335 --> 18:48.629
there never
was any wonder.

18:49.296 --> 18:53.050
You have tularemia from your rabbits.
I put you on antibiotics.

18:53.175 --> 18:55.844
You'll be better
in a couple of days.

18:56.386 --> 18:58.347
Sorry to spoil
the mystery.

18:59.389 --> 19:00.766
Thank you.

19:03.894 --> 19:05.479
(INDISTINCT)

19:13.445 --> 19:15.030
I'll get it.

19:17.366 --> 19:20.285
Oh, my God!

19:21.203 --> 19:23.247
- You're not wearing underwear.
- Of course, I'm...

19:23.372 --> 19:25.249
A skirt that tight,
you got no secrets.

19:25.374 --> 19:28.335
A skirt that tight
I can tell if you got an IUD.

19:28.460 --> 19:29.628
Have you seen
Dr. Cole?

19:29.753 --> 19:30.754
No...

19:31.004 --> 19:32.631
- You're blushing.
- I am not.

19:32.756 --> 19:34.299
Look at me.

19:34.758 --> 19:37.803
Oh, my God!

19:43.267 --> 19:45.102
How'd you do it?

19:46.228 --> 19:47.896
So I'm safe?

19:48.021 --> 19:51.441
In this job, yeah. Your crotch,
on the other hand...

19:51.567 --> 19:53.569
How'd you do it?

19:53.694 --> 19:55.028
Prayer, mostly.

19:58.699 --> 20:01.869
Just tell me.
Does Cuddy have her groove back?

20:03.245 --> 20:05.664
It'd be rude
of me to discuss.

20:06.206 --> 20:08.417
You handed over
her panties.

20:08.542 --> 20:11.003
I don't think gallantry's really
an option at this point.

20:11.128 --> 20:13.255
If I tell you,
then where is the magic?

20:13.380 --> 20:16.258
He passed out. Ultrasound revealed
bleeding around his heart.

20:16.383 --> 20:17.759
We drained 100 cc
before it stopped.

20:18.010 --> 20:19.177
The antibiotics
aren't working.

20:19.303 --> 20:21.638
It's obviously not tularemia
or any other infection.

20:21.805 --> 20:23.557
Excuse me,
we were talking.

20:23.682 --> 20:25.726
Bleeding around
the heart could mean botched biopsy.

20:25.851 --> 20:26.810
When Cole
was looking for...

20:26.935 --> 20:28.145
Why would you
accuse the man

20:28.270 --> 20:30.272
who decides your fate
of screwing up?

20:33.400 --> 20:35.485
Those really
were her panties?

20:35.611 --> 20:38.655
Cole has traveled
through the forest of crustaceans

20:38.780 --> 20:40.449
and brought
us a treasure.

20:40.574 --> 20:42.367
He has earned
his reward.

20:42.492 --> 20:43.994
If I could just
get the immunity, I would...

20:44.119 --> 20:46.246
No, Sophie.
You can't.

20:46.371 --> 20:48.790
Use whatever
criteria you want.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.335
Could be
a clotting issue.

20:51.627 --> 20:53.587
If he developed DIC after the surgery,

20:53.712 --> 20:55.380
even a normal biopsy
bleeds out of control.

20:55.505 --> 20:58.967
So, cardiac arrest and DIC.
What's the common denominator?

20:59.259 --> 21:01.053
- Could be cancer.
- We've been looking at his chest

21:01.178 --> 21:02.346
since he got here.
It's clean.

21:02.471 --> 21:03.680
So the main mass
is somewhere else.

21:03.805 --> 21:08.352
Throws off a clot, blocks an artery
in his heart, causes the arrest.

21:09.269 --> 21:12.230
Good. Go find out
where he's hiding his cancer.

21:15.192 --> 21:19.404
If you swallowed any more metal
now would be a good time to tell us.

21:24.201 --> 21:26.161
My hands feel
kind of numb.

21:26.411 --> 21:28.455
You lost
a lot of blood.

21:30.624 --> 21:32.501
I'm going to die.

21:32.626 --> 21:34.628
Everybody gets scared
in the hospital.

21:34.795 --> 21:35.963
You're sick,
you feel awful...

21:36.088 --> 21:37.631
No.

21:38.715 --> 21:40.676
This time tomorrow,

21:42.469 --> 21:44.346
I'll be dead.

21:59.027 --> 22:01.446
So, who's going
on the block?

22:02.364 --> 22:04.116
He thinks he's dying.

22:04.241 --> 22:05.409
He's probably right.

22:06.785 --> 22:08.245
Tomorrow.

22:09.371 --> 22:11.331
You decide to put me up,
I totally get it.

22:11.456 --> 22:12.416
Nothing personal.

22:12.541 --> 22:13.875
I haven't
decided anything.

22:14.001 --> 22:15.043
But you
don't like me.

22:15.168 --> 22:16.461
I like you.

22:18.588 --> 22:20.507
There's some
fluid in the lungs.

22:20.882 --> 22:22.426
No masses.

22:23.468 --> 22:26.179
I'm manipulative.
I play the game.

22:26.471 --> 22:28.015
I can be a bitch.

22:28.140 --> 22:29.433
There's a dark spot.

22:30.684 --> 22:32.769
Damage from where
the key ripped through.

22:32.894 --> 22:35.397
You're probably expecting me
to bash the others.

22:35.522 --> 22:40.694
Give examples of how they screwed up.
You know I can. I'm a good doctor.

22:42.154 --> 22:45.365
As good as anybody around here.
Probably better.

22:45.657 --> 22:48.660
And you know that's
the only thing that matters.

22:58.128 --> 22:59.504
What's that?

23:03.800 --> 23:06.928
It's not a tumor, it's another bleed.
This one's in his kidney.

23:07.220 --> 23:10.307
And his thigh. He's bleeding
all over the place.

23:11.266 --> 23:13.226
His timetable
may be right on.

23:18.106 --> 23:21.443
It was creepy.
The patient predicted his own death.

23:21.568 --> 23:24.529
Would have been more impressive if he
predicted that he wasn't going to die.

23:24.696 --> 23:27.115
- Of course, that takes longer to prove.
- Could be a symptom.

23:27.240 --> 23:28.366
Sense of impending doom.

23:28.492 --> 23:32.662
Yeah, could be adrenal gland disorders,
blood issues, anaphylaxis...

23:32.871 --> 23:34.581
If you're going to
kiss his ass to protect your ass,

23:34.706 --> 23:36.625
at least wait until
he's had a good idea.

23:36.750 --> 23:38.376
It's a symptom
of him being a charlatan.

23:38.502 --> 23:40.337
He's a second-rate magician
with a mysterious illness.

23:40.462 --> 23:41.755
Why wouldn't
he predict his own death?

23:41.880 --> 23:44.132
If he's wrong, we all forget it.
If he's right, he goes out a legend.

23:44.257 --> 23:45.926
KUTNER: He got scared right
after a transfusion.

23:46.051 --> 23:48.845
Tainted blood has been known
to cause a sense of impending doom.

23:48.970 --> 23:49.930
It could also
explain the DIC.

23:50.055 --> 23:53.892
I predict all
your pagers go off right now.

23:57.104 --> 23:58.063
But if it
had happened...

23:58.188 --> 24:01.483
Anyone bother looking at his panel?
His immunoglobulin levels are low.

24:01.650 --> 24:02.901
That doesn't tell
us anything specific...

24:03.026 --> 24:06.655
Are you acting stupid because
you know you're safe? Clever.

24:06.780 --> 24:10.117
Low immunoglobulin plus failing heart,
plus fluid in the lungs,

24:10.242 --> 24:12.452
plus internal bleeding
equals amyloidosis.

24:12.786 --> 24:14.704
He's bleeding way
too much for amyloidosis.

24:14.830 --> 24:17.165
Say anything about
his hands or feet feeling weak?

24:17.290 --> 24:21.503
He said his hands felt numb,
but that's explained by the blood loss.

24:21.837 --> 24:23.255
(PAGERS BEEPING)

24:24.381 --> 24:27.342
No!
Do not give me credit for that.

24:27.467 --> 24:30.929
Close doesn't count. That's how people
get sucked into this stupidity.

24:31.054 --> 24:31.888
He's seizing.

24:32.013 --> 24:33.723
Somebody
stabilize him.

24:33.974 --> 24:36.601
The rest of you pull
his medical records. Go back 10 years.

24:36.726 --> 24:40.897
Look for joint pain, fatigue,
anything associated with amyloidosis.

24:41.815 --> 24:44.568
Mr. Finn,
nod if you can hear me.

24:46.653 --> 24:47.946
You had
a grand mal seizure.

24:48.071 --> 24:49.865
We're giving you liquids
and an anticonvulsant.

24:49.990 --> 24:51.366
Just try to rest.

24:52.617 --> 24:54.828
Pulse is dropping.
He's stabilizing.

24:55.662 --> 24:56.872
You're not going to
put me on the block, are you?

24:57.080 --> 24:59.207
I haven't decided who
I'm going to pick.

24:59.332 --> 25:00.917
It's cool.

25:01.418 --> 25:03.753
His legs look
swollen to you?

25:03.879 --> 25:05.172
Slight swelling
could be renal.

25:05.338 --> 25:06.673
I baby-sat for you.

25:06.798 --> 25:10.343
I decided I'm going to make my decision
based solely on who deserves to be here.

25:10.468 --> 25:12.762
That's admirable,
though stupid.

25:13.305 --> 25:15.765
You shouldn't save the strongest.
You should get rid of the strongest.

25:15.891 --> 25:18.852
Eliminate your competition,
which is definitely not me.

25:19.227 --> 25:20.770
And I'm your friend.

25:20.896 --> 25:22.439
And how you going
to explain to your kid

25:22.564 --> 25:26.026
that I can't take him to the zoo
next week because you got me fired?

25:26.151 --> 25:29.112
Kutner,
he's going to seize again.

25:29.404 --> 25:33.658
Flank pain, his kidneys are shutting
down. Also, Amber's a racist.

25:36.828 --> 25:38.580
You knew
they'd get paged?

25:38.705 --> 25:40.040
I noticed a trend.

25:40.165 --> 25:43.877
If nobody does anything,
sick people often gets sicker.

25:44.002 --> 25:46.546
Do you think it's
remotely possible they had sex?

25:46.671 --> 25:49.049
They're both single.
It's still legal in the blue states.

25:49.174 --> 25:50.800
She barely knows him.

25:51.092 --> 25:52.469
You know,
in some cultures,

25:52.594 --> 25:55.764
hiring people to steal someone's
underpants is considered wooing.

25:55.889 --> 25:59.267
You should move there, because here
it's just, you know, creepy.

25:59.601 --> 26:02.562
This was no woo.
This was an effective test!

26:03.480 --> 26:05.774
This is beneath
my skills.

26:05.899 --> 26:07.442
Kidneys are
shutting down.

26:07.567 --> 26:09.694
Led to a sodium deficiency
and caused him to seize.

26:09.986 --> 26:12.030
Kidney failure means
that I was right about amyloidosis.

26:12.155 --> 26:15.700
Except that nothing in his medical
history remotely indicates amyloidosis.

26:15.825 --> 26:18.245
So, kidney failure
proves I'm right about the bad blood.

26:18.370 --> 26:20.664
Bad blood doesn't
explain the heart or the liver.

26:20.789 --> 26:23.166
His major symptoms didn't start
until after we transfused him.

26:23.291 --> 26:25.877
Is cardiac arrest
no longer considered a major symptom?

26:26.002 --> 26:27.379
Not when it's
caused by drowning.

26:27.504 --> 26:29.714
So your new theory is that you were
an idiot to take this case.

26:30.090 --> 26:31.549
Yes. Can I go test
that theory now?

26:31.675 --> 26:35.262
Waste of time. He needs a bone marrow
transplant for the amyloidosis.

26:35.387 --> 26:36.680
You'd have to
irradiate him first.

26:36.805 --> 26:37.722
If they're right
about the blood,

26:37.889 --> 26:40.141
you'd be destroying
his immune system for nothing.

26:40.267 --> 26:43.812
Which could be a good thing.
Does he have a really crappy life?

26:43.937 --> 26:46.564
Go prove I'm right.
Do a subcutaneous fat biopsy.

26:46.690 --> 26:48.441
At least let us eliminate
the bad blood theory.

26:48.566 --> 26:52.153
Check the blood banks
for mismarks and contamination.

26:56.032 --> 26:57.158
You got two hours.

26:57.450 --> 26:58.618
That's completely
arbitrary.

26:58.743 --> 27:01.663
No, if I'd said that you've got
three lunar months,

27:01.788 --> 27:02.872
that'd be
completely arbitrary.

27:02.998 --> 27:04.624
Two hours is how long
it's going to take Big Love

27:04.749 --> 27:06.710
to finish the biopsy
that you guys can't do,

27:06.835 --> 27:10.130
because you're wasting
two hours checking blood.

27:10.255 --> 27:12.799
- Nine, three!
- Five, all!

27:15.677 --> 27:18.930
Hey, brought you
something from the cafeteria.

27:20.265 --> 27:23.518
It's not a bribe.
This is a bribe.

27:27.355 --> 27:28.398
How much?

27:28.523 --> 27:29.649
$1 million.

27:31.276 --> 27:32.652
$5,000.

27:34.529 --> 27:36.197
- This is so wrong.
- House specifically said

27:36.323 --> 27:38.074
you can use whatever
criteria you want.

27:38.199 --> 27:40.493
I've got money.
You need money.

27:42.162 --> 27:44.372
- Hand me that slide.
- Right now, you're earning

27:44.497 --> 27:47.459
what I'm earning,
which is miserable.

27:47.959 --> 27:51.379
I know what school your kid's at.
I know what it costs.

27:52.839 --> 27:54.758
I've seen his picture.

27:55.759 --> 27:57.886
He's going
to need braces.

28:00.221 --> 28:01.514
KUTNER:
No RBC damage.

28:01.639 --> 28:02.724
THIRTEEN:
Nothing wrong with storage.

28:02.849 --> 28:06.311
I'm going to double-check type
and start cultures.

28:06.770 --> 28:09.147
We still got
32 minutes left.

28:09.272 --> 28:11.441
Time flies.
What have you found?

28:11.566 --> 28:12.567
You're checking
up on them.

28:12.692 --> 28:14.819
It means Cole's finished
with the biopsy and it was negative.

28:15.070 --> 28:16.738
Inconclusive.

28:16.905 --> 28:18.531
The fat doesn't always
give you the answer.

28:18.656 --> 28:21.493
You need to biopsy his actual organs,
lungs, kidneys, liver.

28:21.618 --> 28:23.328
We stick another
needle in him, he'll hemorrhage.

28:23.453 --> 28:25.789
Unless we start
treatment for amyloidosis.

28:25.914 --> 28:27.707
Unless it's
not amyloidosis.

28:27.832 --> 28:29.876
If he has an infection,
the radiation will kill him.

28:30.001 --> 28:31.336
Show me evidence
of infection.

28:31.461 --> 28:32.754
We need more
than two hours.

28:32.879 --> 28:34.881
Some of these cultures
will take at least a day to grow.

28:35.006 --> 28:36.883
- He'll be dead in a day.
- Like he predicted.

28:37.008 --> 28:39.177
No, he'll be
half a day off.

28:39.302 --> 28:40.470
Would it make you guys feel any better

28:40.595 --> 28:43.390
if I let you argue
with me for three minutes

28:43.515 --> 28:46.184
before I order you
to treat for amyloidosis?

28:46.309 --> 28:48.770
No. Just treat
for amyloidosis.

28:48.895 --> 28:50.146
No, don't.

28:52.982 --> 28:54.567
You're playing
the Cuddy card?

28:54.901 --> 28:55.735
That's why I'm here.

28:55.902 --> 28:57.195
Amyloidosis
was your idea.

28:57.320 --> 28:58.405
I was wrong.

28:58.530 --> 29:00.907
Yeah, me, too.
You were never fun.

29:02.700 --> 29:04.411
Give me the blood.

29:06.496 --> 29:08.164
I'm type AB.
Give me the blood.

29:08.289 --> 29:09.707
Whatever's in there
could be killing him.

29:09.874 --> 29:11.084
In where?

29:11.209 --> 29:13.795
How much tainted blood
do you think they keep in here?

29:13.920 --> 29:14.879
How many people
have gotten sick from...

29:15.004 --> 29:17.257
It would have to have
been the first batch, the splenectomy.

29:17.424 --> 29:18.341
That's when
the symptoms started.

29:18.508 --> 29:21.302
Okay, let's transfuse blood
from those donors.

29:21.428 --> 29:24.597
I'll be fine, we'll move on,
treat for amyloidosis.

29:26.141 --> 29:27.725
Fill 'er up!

29:32.188 --> 29:33.982
HOUSE: I have a new theory.

29:35.442 --> 29:37.318
You're not stubborn.

29:38.570 --> 29:42.740
You're not going to get checked because
you already know the answer.

29:43.867 --> 29:45.452
I found an
old picture in your wallet.

29:45.577 --> 29:47.745
Of course you did.

29:49.164 --> 29:52.375
I wasn't snooping.
I needed lunch money.

29:54.002 --> 29:57.755
I figure it's your mom,
except she looks about 32 years old.

29:59.132 --> 30:02.969
Now, the only reason
not to update a photo in 20-odd years,

30:03.553 --> 30:05.472
is she's not
talking to you,

30:05.597 --> 30:07.348
which would
be interesting,

30:07.474 --> 30:10.727
or she's dead, which would
also be interesting.

30:13.771 --> 30:15.356
She's dead.

30:16.858 --> 30:18.776
So is Grover Cleveland.

30:21.154 --> 30:23.698
Pretty young to
have a dead mom.

30:25.783 --> 30:27.911
Even younger
20 years ago.

30:29.204 --> 30:31.206
I Googled her obituary.

30:33.374 --> 30:37.462
Said she died at New Haven Presbyterian
after a long illness.

30:39.088 --> 30:40.632
Parkinson's?

30:49.849 --> 30:51.893
Huntington's chorea.

30:55.563 --> 30:56.940
I'm sorry.

30:58.316 --> 31:00.318
I'm leaving when
this case is over.

31:00.443 --> 31:01.945
No, you're not.

31:02.779 --> 31:04.030
You don't want
a doctor on your team

31:04.155 --> 31:06.783
who's slowly losing
control of her body and mind.

31:06.908 --> 31:09.869
Huntington's isn't
the only thing that causes tremors.

31:09.994 --> 31:11.412
You think it's
just a coincidence?

31:11.538 --> 31:15.208
I think you're the only
one on the team who drinks decaf.

31:18.127 --> 31:20.129
I've been switching it out
with the regular

31:20.255 --> 31:22.173
ever since you dropped that file.

31:22.298 --> 31:26.010
You're trembling because
you're hopped up on caffeine.

31:26.636 --> 31:28.596
The first file
wasn't my fault.

31:28.721 --> 31:32.141
Medical explanation for that is,
people drop things.

31:33.268 --> 31:35.520
I've been walking around
thinking I'm dying.

31:35.645 --> 31:36.980
You are.

31:37.105 --> 31:37.981
You don't know that.

31:38.606 --> 31:39.899
With Huntington's,
it's inevitable.

31:40.024 --> 31:43.444
No, you don't know,
because I don't know.

31:45.655 --> 31:47.824
How could you
not get tested?

31:49.576 --> 31:54.622
If your mom had it, it's a 50% chance
you're a bomb waiting to explode.

31:54.747 --> 31:57.417
Not knowing makes me do things
I think I'm scared to do.

31:57.542 --> 32:01.045
Take flying lessons, climb Kilimanjaro,
work for you.

32:01.588 --> 32:05.800
Yeah, 'cause if you knew,
you couldn't do any of those things.

32:07.051 --> 32:08.094
What?

32:08.219 --> 32:09.220
You're sweating.

32:11.389 --> 32:13.099
You're burning up.

32:13.891 --> 32:17.020
House, you're sick.

32:21.024 --> 32:23.860
KUTNER: Could be pneumococcus. That'd
cause chest pain and a stiff neck.

32:23.985 --> 32:25.153
It's not pneumococcus.

32:25.278 --> 32:27.488
Let me check
your lymph nodes.

32:27.864 --> 32:29.073
I'm not the patient!

32:29.240 --> 32:30.950
The patient is
the one whose body is shutting down.

32:31.075 --> 32:33.745
I'm having a benign
transfusion reaction.

32:33.870 --> 32:37.206
Pseudomonas would present
as an armpit rash. Take off your shirt.

32:37.415 --> 32:39.542
- You first.
- House, you gotta let us do this.

32:39.667 --> 32:41.919
We can't biopsy him
without bleeding him to death.

32:42.045 --> 32:43.171
You are not biopsying me.

32:43.296 --> 32:46.090
How's your stomach?
Any diarrhea?

32:46.215 --> 32:49.469
The more transfusions you have,
the greater the chance of you reacting.

32:49.594 --> 32:53.097
I've had three in a decade. The fever
will be gone in a couple of hours.

32:53.222 --> 32:55.308
I heard somewhere
that doctors ignore symptoms

32:55.516 --> 32:57.101
because they think
they can't get sick.

32:57.226 --> 32:58.895
You told us to give you the blood
so that you wouldn't...

32:59.020 --> 33:00.438
I am not sick.

33:00.563 --> 33:01.814
Fever is a symptom.

33:01.981 --> 33:03.816
But not of what
the patient has.

33:03.941 --> 33:06.152
My kidneys are working.
I'm not bleeding out of every organ.

33:06.277 --> 33:07.445
Yet.

33:08.613 --> 33:09.947
This is a waste of time,

33:10.365 --> 33:13.284
and it's distracting you
from the actual case.

33:16.871 --> 33:17.705
What's wrong?

33:17.997 --> 33:19.082
The room's spinning.

33:19.207 --> 33:20.208
You Okay?

33:20.333 --> 33:23.628
Dizzy, my mouth
just went dry.

33:23.795 --> 33:24.754
Could be
a symptom of a...

33:24.879 --> 33:27.215
It's a symptom
of narcotics.

33:30.176 --> 33:31.844
Who spiked my...

33:42.689 --> 33:43.856
What'd you
drug him with?

33:43.981 --> 33:47.902
Amber's nickname is "Cutthroat Bitch"
and you're pointing at me?

33:48.027 --> 33:49.987
Got the kidney sample.

33:51.239 --> 33:54.242
You're the only one
with nothing to lose.

33:54.367 --> 33:57.495
Could have been you. You don't seem
to care if you get this job or not.

33:57.620 --> 33:59.664
Yeah, I've been here for eight weeks
because my subscription

33:59.789 --> 34:00.998
<i>to Masochism Weekly
ran</i> out.

34:01.124 --> 34:04.544
You're the only one who hasn't asked me
not to put them on the block.

34:04.669 --> 34:07.422
You're either going
to pick me or you're not.

34:07.547 --> 34:09.632
You're fair enough
to try to make the right decision,

34:09.757 --> 34:13.177
and arrogant enough that
nothing I can say will change your mind.

34:13.302 --> 34:15.805
I don't want it
to be over, but,

34:15.930 --> 34:19.434
unless worrying about it
is going to make a difference...

34:26.941 --> 34:27.942
(GROANS)

34:30.153 --> 34:32.363
I'm going to run
some stains.

34:32.822 --> 34:35.199
He'll be less
of an ass to you.

34:45.251 --> 34:46.794
Patient dead yet?

34:46.919 --> 34:48.045
No.

34:51.507 --> 34:53.176
It's a little much
for a first date.

34:53.301 --> 34:55.595
Obviously,
you've never dated me.

34:55.720 --> 34:59.474
Feels like you
already got the lung and kidney samples.

34:59.599 --> 35:01.100
Now I just need
a piece of your liver.

35:01.225 --> 35:03.478
Hey, you might want
to use a little bit of lidocaine.

35:03.603 --> 35:06.773
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
Slight pinch!

35:17.116 --> 35:18.910
You drugged me.

35:20.203 --> 35:21.996
You drugged me.

35:46.938 --> 35:48.523
Stopped by the lab.

35:48.648 --> 35:52.443
Your mutinous team is starting to worry
about life on Pitcairn Island.

35:52.568 --> 35:54.862
All your biopsies
are clean.

35:55.196 --> 35:57.907
Because there's
nothing wrong with me.

35:58.407 --> 36:01.869
Did Foreman finally okay
the amyloidosis treatment?

36:02.036 --> 36:05.122
Patient's scheduled
for irradiation at 9:00.

36:06.624 --> 36:08.751
You risked your life again.

36:09.710 --> 36:11.170
You couldn't be sure
he had amyloidosis.

36:11.462 --> 36:12.880
You can't be sure
that I couldn't be sure.

36:13.005 --> 36:14.507
You did one test.
It was negative.

36:14.632 --> 36:15.883
- Inconclusive.
- Well, then,

36:16.008 --> 36:19.303
by all means, flood your body
with possibly lethal blood.

36:19.428 --> 36:21.889
I usually like to give
the lethal blood to Foreman,

36:22.014 --> 36:23.516
but I'm the only
one who's type AB.

36:23.641 --> 36:27.186
Of course
you're type AB, universal recipient.

36:27.812 --> 36:29.438
You take from everybody.

36:29.564 --> 36:32.525
Of course,
you're type O. Universal donor.

36:32.650 --> 36:35.528
No wonder you're
paying three alimonies.

36:36.612 --> 36:39.198
How do you know
what blood type I am?

36:39.323 --> 36:41.450
I don't.
It just seemed to fit the metaphor.

36:41.576 --> 36:42.952
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

36:43.828 --> 36:45.955
Did you
test my blood for something?

36:46.622 --> 36:48.082
Why would you
test my blood for something?

36:48.207 --> 36:49.667
I didn't.

36:50.251 --> 36:52.295
You must have told
me what you were.

36:52.420 --> 36:54.922
Who the hell chats
about their blood type?

36:55.047 --> 36:56.924
You had to
have tested me.

37:01.762 --> 37:05.182
There's no reason to ask anyone
their blood type.

37:06.183 --> 37:09.312
You're about to run
out of here, aren't you?

37:12.106 --> 37:14.525
Nurse,
can I have a moment with my patient?

37:14.692 --> 37:15.735
He's due
in radiation.

37:15.902 --> 37:18.321
It's too late,
he's dying.

37:23.784 --> 37:25.578
Told you.

37:25.703 --> 37:27.747
I'm sorry
I doubted you.

37:29.582 --> 37:32.835
It'd be a shame
if your secrets died with you.

37:33.961 --> 37:37.173
Perhaps you've got
that trick written down somewhere.

37:37.298 --> 37:41.218
Or maybe you want to
tell me and I'll write it down for you.

37:42.011 --> 37:44.138
That way you
can live on.

37:45.890 --> 37:50.061
I'm taking it with me.
See, that way it stays magic.

37:51.812 --> 37:54.357
You were wrong
about everything.

37:54.941 --> 37:57.944
It was never magic,
and you're not dying.

37:59.070 --> 38:01.155
What's your
blood type?

38:01.697 --> 38:02.823
Type A.

38:04.867 --> 38:05.910
What?

38:06.035 --> 38:08.704
Trust me,
it's way cooler to know.

38:13.876 --> 38:15.461
Where's Finn?

38:15.962 --> 38:17.338
Up my sleeve.

38:17.880 --> 38:21.300
It's not amyloidosis.
And his blood's fine.

38:21.467 --> 38:23.511
We just gave him
the wrong type.

38:23.636 --> 38:26.931
Caused the DIC, explains the bleeding,
multi-system failures.

38:27.139 --> 38:27.974
But we tested
his blood.

38:28.099 --> 38:31.852
That's because we don't test blood
for type. We test for antibodies.

38:31.978 --> 38:33.521
Because your
body only makes those antibodies

38:33.646 --> 38:35.648
when you actually
have that type of blood.

38:35.773 --> 38:37.233
Well, apparently,
he has one more symptom.

38:37.358 --> 38:40.194
His body's making
an extra antibody, type B.

38:40.319 --> 38:43.322
Combine that with his natural
type A and, presto, change-o,

38:43.447 --> 38:46.242
he magically pulls
blood type AB out of his hat.

38:46.367 --> 38:48.327
- Would you stop that?
- God, yes.

38:48.452 --> 38:51.539
Autoimmune diseases can make antibodies
go haywire, but, still...

38:51.664 --> 38:54.417
It's happened. And apparently,
it's happened again.

38:54.542 --> 38:57.044
I finally have
a case of lupus.

38:57.169 --> 39:00.172
Flush him with saline,
transfuse four units, type A

39:00.297 --> 39:01.590
and start him on steroids.

39:01.716 --> 39:04.885
He'll be back
hoodwinking idiots in no time.

39:22.653 --> 39:24.655
(DOOR OPENS)

39:30.911 --> 39:32.997
Big Love, rise.

39:39.754 --> 39:42.089
Use their power wisely,
my Lord.

39:46.761 --> 39:48.804
I nominate Amber.

39:49.597 --> 39:52.016
Cutthroat Bitch, rise.

39:55.978 --> 39:58.814
You're surprised?
You're everyone's pick.

39:59.148 --> 40:00.816
Next victim.

40:01.233 --> 40:02.318
I nominate

40:04.361 --> 40:05.404
Kutner.

40:12.328 --> 40:14.914
Now everyone's
surprised. Why?

40:16.165 --> 40:18.042
You said I don't
have to justify my picks.

40:18.375 --> 40:21.337
No, I said you
could use whatever criteria you want.

40:21.587 --> 40:23.422
Doesn't mean
I don't wanna know.

40:23.547 --> 40:25.966
He was right about
this being a real case,

40:26.133 --> 40:30.888
he was right about the botched
transfusion and he's your love nugget.

40:31.013 --> 40:33.182
You got no reason
to pick him.

40:38.938 --> 40:41.065
But somebody else does.

40:42.358 --> 40:44.443
Kutner's a liability.

40:44.568 --> 40:46.570
He electrocuted himself,
lit a patient on fire,

40:46.695 --> 40:50.449
it's only a matter of time
before he burns the hospital down.

40:51.367 --> 40:53.577
You made a deal
with Cuddy.

40:57.039 --> 40:59.375
That's how you
got her underwear.

40:59.500 --> 41:03.379
She sold it to you for the right
to put her choices on the block.

41:03.587 --> 41:06.882
You said get
her underwear. I got it.

41:07.758 --> 41:09.969
Your scheme was brilliant,

41:12.096 --> 41:13.681
and you're fired.

41:14.598 --> 41:16.809
You're all about
breaking the rules.

41:16.934 --> 41:18.769
Her rules, not mine.

41:19.395 --> 41:21.230
The whole point
of this was to subvert Cuddy.

41:21.355 --> 41:23.983
You became her partner,
gave her power she didn't already have.

41:24.358 --> 41:26.485
Let her greedy fingers
into my cookie jar,

41:26.610 --> 41:29.405
which sadly
is not as dirty as it sounds.

41:31.448 --> 41:33.242
Thanks for playing.

41:59.602 --> 42:01.729
What the hell is this?

42:04.481 --> 42:07.693
Looks like an envelope with
the results of a genetic test

42:07.818 --> 42:09.778
for Huntington's inside.

42:09.904 --> 42:11.447
Did you look?

42:11.572 --> 42:13.282
I thought it'd be fun
to find out together.

42:13.407 --> 42:14.700
I don't want to know.

42:14.950 --> 42:16.785
No, you're
afraid to know.

42:17.661 --> 42:21.457
I might die. So could you.
You could get hit by a bus tomorrow.

42:21.665 --> 42:25.461
The only difference is you don't have to
know about it today. So why should I?

42:25.586 --> 42:27.838
I don't have to know
the lottery numbers,

42:27.963 --> 42:30.841
but if someone offered them to me,
I'd take them.

42:30.966 --> 42:34.136
You spend your whole life
looking for answers,

42:35.304 --> 42:37.932
because you think the next answer
will change something.

42:38.057 --> 42:40.935
Maybe make you
a little less miserable.

42:41.852 --> 42:43.771
And you know that when you run out
of questions

42:43.896 --> 42:46.607
you don't just
run out of answers,

42:46.732 --> 42:48.901
you run out of hope.

42:51.153 --> 42:53.072
Are you glad
you know that?
