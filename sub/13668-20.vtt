WEBVTT

01:47.920 --> 01:50.040
Now, don't let that spoil
your dinner, OK, Tanya?

01:50.040 --> 01:51.080
OK.

01:51.080 --> 01:55.080
OK.

01:57.040 --> 01:59.840
Look out, coming through!

01:59.840 --> 02:03.840
Put her in number three.

02:04.920 --> 02:06.240
Jenny, where is Dr Morrison?

02:06.240 --> 02:07.360
Across the hall.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.039
Jack, we need you!

02:09.039 --> 02:11.600
BP is falling. She must've
swallowed the whole bottle.

02:11.600 --> 02:15.600
OK, I'll be right with you. Jack,
wake up! Drug overdose. Come on!

02:17.320 --> 02:18.600
When am I supposed to study?

02:18.600 --> 02:21.680
You got two days until the boards,
right now we have to pump her out.

02:21.680 --> 02:24.520
What do I do when I flunk
and get dropped from residency?

02:24.520 --> 02:27.720
Come on, you won't flunk. Besides,
that's only one part of evaluations.

02:27.720 --> 02:29.200
They're just cutting five residents.

02:29.200 --> 02:30.480
They're just cutting five residents.

02:30.480 --> 02:33.680
You know, Dr Craig, with all
this uncertainty in the air

02:33.680 --> 02:35.880
with the Board exams coming up,
I'm wondering...

02:35.880 --> 02:36.920
Pacemaker.

02:36.920 --> 02:40.080
We all know the residency programme
calls for a big cut at the end

02:40.080 --> 02:41.120
of the first year.

02:41.120 --> 02:44.160
And since you and I have probably
worked together more closely

02:44.160 --> 02:45.200
than any other...

02:45.200 --> 02:46.800
Two oral prolene, please.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.600
I was just wondering if,
you know, off the record,

02:49.600 --> 02:53.480
you might have some unofficial idea
of what my chances might be.

02:53.480 --> 02:56.440
I hear you have been obnoxious
in surgery when I'm not around.

02:56.440 --> 02:57.720
Obnoxious?

02:57.720 --> 03:01.320
Insensitive comments, raunchy jokes,

03:01.320 --> 03:04.120
offending the nurses
with your personality.

03:04.120 --> 03:06.720
That's a good capture there.

03:06.720 --> 03:10.040
I think you'll find as you go along,
that you'll never do really well

03:10.040 --> 03:14.040
in surgery without the respect
of your colleagues in OR.

03:14.560 --> 03:16.200
Wait, as I go along,
what do you mean?

03:16.200 --> 03:17.720
Into the second year residency?

03:17.720 --> 03:19.320
Not necessarily.

03:19.320 --> 03:20.960
I mean, as you get older,

03:20.960 --> 03:23.480
as you have different
professional experiences.

03:23.480 --> 03:26.200
What do you mean?
At different hospitals?

03:26.200 --> 03:30.200
Dr Craig, are you saying
I might not make the cut?

03:31.840 --> 03:34.200
Don't do this to me, I've got
a lot of studying tomorrow.

03:34.200 --> 03:36.040
Not to worry, Victor.

03:36.040 --> 03:40.040
In my opinion, the Department Of
Surgery is critically understaffed.

03:40.440 --> 03:42.720
Your opinion only counts
when we talk chutney.

03:42.720 --> 03:46.480
Irrigation.

03:46.480 --> 03:48.760
What I'm getting at is,
if I'm to make other plans,

03:48.760 --> 03:51.240
it might be nice to have
a little advanced warning.

03:51.240 --> 03:55.240
The life of a resident wasn't
designed to be nice, Ehrlich.

03:55.280 --> 03:57.400
&lt; It was designed to make sure
that you know

03:57.400 --> 04:00.560
what you're doing
and that you respond under pressure.

04:00.560 --> 04:02.600
I'm not complaining,
I'm was just hoping.

04:02.600 --> 04:04.840
Stitch.

04:04.840 --> 04:05.880
You realise, Victor? &gt;

04:05.880 --> 04:09.800
Dr Craig is just trying
to give you the business.

04:09.800 --> 04:13.560
Kochar, keep your nose out
of the nitrous. And, Ehrlich,

04:13.560 --> 04:15.240
I can't do your studying for you.

04:15.240 --> 04:18.279
I can't write
a recommendation for you.

04:18.279 --> 04:21.000
And I am only one
vote on the committee.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.200
What you're saying is,
I'm not out of the woods.

04:23.200 --> 04:27.200
Right.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.760
Right.

04:29.760 --> 04:33.760
Right.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.560
You sure you want to do this?

04:46.560 --> 04:49.280
If there's a chance it'll get me
off, I'll do anything.

04:49.280 --> 04:51.200
Just remember,
the trial starts tomorrow.

04:51.200 --> 04:53.600
The results of this test
automatically go to the jury,

04:53.600 --> 04:55.840
whether you pass it or not.

04:55.840 --> 04:57.440
I'm ready.

04:57.440 --> 05:01.440
I'll be watching to make sure
he doesn't throw you any curves.

05:01.560 --> 05:05.560
Please take a seat, Dr White.

05:11.880 --> 05:15.880
Please remain as still as possible.

05:28.360 --> 05:31.440
Tell me a lie, Dr White,
don't answer truthfully.

05:31.440 --> 05:32.760
Are you wearing a watch?

05:32.760 --> 05:33.840
No. &gt;

05:33.840 --> 05:36.440
Now answer truthfully this time.
Are you wearing a watch?

05:36.440 --> 05:38.680
Yes. &gt;

05:38.680 --> 05:40.800
Tell me a lie,
don't answer truthfully.

05:40.800 --> 05:44.120
Did you graduate
from college in 1976?

05:44.120 --> 05:45.240
No. &gt;

05:45.240 --> 05:49.240
Now, answer truthfully, did you
graduate from college in 1976?

05:50.120 --> 05:51.360
Yes.

05:51.360 --> 05:54.040
&lt; Tell me a lie, don't answer
truthfully, have you taken pills,

05:54.040 --> 05:56.960
&lt; medication or narcotic
for the purpose of passing this test?

05:56.960 --> 05:58.640
Yes.

05:58.640 --> 06:01.080
Now, answer truthfully,
have you taken any pills,

06:01.080 --> 06:03.920
medication or narcotic
for the purpose of passing this test?

06:03.920 --> 06:05.800
No.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.640
&lt; Tell me a lie,
don't answer truthfully.

06:07.640 --> 06:10.480
&lt; Are you the one who raped
Cathy Martin?

06:10.480 --> 06:14.480
Yes.

06:15.840 --> 06:19.160
I've just taken over this case from
Dr Helfmann, who's away in New York.

06:19.160 --> 06:20.720
All right, go ahead.

06:20.720 --> 06:23.560
Well, Dr Helfmann suspected
pulmonary embolism.

06:23.560 --> 06:24.960
Started him on heparin, IV.

06:24.960 --> 06:27.200
How long ago was that?

06:27.200 --> 06:28.600
72 hours. &gt;

06:28.600 --> 06:31.640
Mr Kremmins subsequently developed
in large abdominal hematoma

06:31.640 --> 06:33.480
with associated nausea and vomiting.

06:33.480 --> 06:37.480
For which Dr Helfmann
prescribed Compazine,

06:37.680 --> 06:39.400
25 mg every six hours.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.120
What about the twitching?

06:41.120 --> 06:43.360
He's now experiencing
an oculogyric crisis,

06:43.360 --> 06:44.440
origin unknown.

06:44.440 --> 06:45.520
Indicating?

06:45.520 --> 06:47.840
Central nervous system defect.

06:47.840 --> 06:51.840
Metabolic?

06:52.800 --> 06:53.880
Possible stroke in evolution.

06:53.880 --> 06:57.880
Possible stroke in evolution.

07:00.720 --> 07:02.000
I want you to order a CAT scan.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.120
I have him down
for 11:30 this morning.

07:04.120 --> 07:05.400
Mm-hm.

07:05.400 --> 07:06.360
And get a cerebral arteriogram.

07:06.360 --> 07:07.400
And get a cerebral arteriogram.

07:07.400 --> 07:10.480
The next time you see signs
of a central nervous system defect,

07:10.480 --> 07:11.800
I suggest you move a hell
of a lot faster, Doctor.

07:11.800 --> 07:12.840
I suggest you move a hell
of a lot faster, Doctor.

07:12.840 --> 07:15.960
Mortality conference at six.

07:15.960 --> 07:19.800
Yes, sir.

07:19.800 --> 07:23.800
Yes, sir.

07:40.120 --> 07:44.120
Oh, no thanks. I'm on the wagon.

07:50.200 --> 07:51.840
Excuse me.

07:51.840 --> 07:53.480
This is St Eligius, isn't it?

07:53.480 --> 07:54.520
You said it.

07:54.520 --> 07:57.120
It's hard to tell in the rain.

07:57.120 --> 08:00.680
Listen, Cheryl, I am looking
for a doctor Victor Ehrlich.

08:00.680 --> 08:02.880
You're Victor's aunt, right?

08:02.880 --> 08:04.480
Right.

08:04.480 --> 08:06.280
He's upstairs.
Should I page him for you?

08:06.280 --> 08:07.640
That's a lot of trouble.

08:07.640 --> 08:11.640
No, nothing to it.

08:13.040 --> 08:14.640
Yeah, Lisa, this is Shirley.

08:14.640 --> 08:18.120
Could you page Dr Ehrlich
and tell him his aunt is down in ER?

08:18.120 --> 08:19.400
Right.

08:19.400 --> 08:23.200
Thanks. He'll be here...

08:23.200 --> 08:27.200
..in a jiffy.

08:30.760 --> 08:34.760
(WHISPERS)

08:34.799 --> 08:38.799
You said the man in the ski mask
knocked you down.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.280
Yes.

08:40.280 --> 08:44.280
Mm-hm. Had you pulled
the mask from his face by then?

08:45.960 --> 08:47.520
I must have by then.

08:47.520 --> 08:49.040
You don't remember?

08:49.040 --> 08:52.160
You knew the exact time of day,
the colour of the mask, the kind

08:52.160 --> 08:56.160
of coat he was wearing, yet you
don't remember what happened when.

08:57.280 --> 08:58.320
I was terrified.

08:58.320 --> 08:59.360
Uh-huh.

08:59.360 --> 09:03.360
Hadn't you lost your temper
at Peter White that same morning?

09:04.760 --> 09:07.720
Oh, he had ruined
some valuable slides.

09:07.720 --> 09:09.040
That you had been working
on for a long time.

09:09.040 --> 09:10.080
That you had been working
on for a long time.

09:10.080 --> 09:14.080
In other words, you resented him
being reassigned to the morgue?

09:14.640 --> 09:18.040
Not really. In fact,
I was glad to have more help.

09:18.040 --> 09:22.040
Oh, I see, with all those handsome
doctors around St Eligius,

09:22.360 --> 09:26.360
you were happy to finally have one
at your beck and call.

09:26.440 --> 09:27.680
What?  Objection.

09:27.680 --> 09:29.880
He's putting words
in the witness's mouth.

09:29.880 --> 09:33.360
Leading the witness, Mr Ashman.
Sustained.

09:33.360 --> 09:36.160
Your Honour,
I am just trying to reconstruct.

09:36.160 --> 09:38.280
Now he's baiting the witness.

09:38.280 --> 09:40.600
Not at all. I'll allow it.

09:40.600 --> 09:43.680
&lt; Go on.

09:43.680 --> 09:47.680
No.

09:48.320 --> 09:52.320
How many other times have you had
sexual relations at the morgue?

09:52.600 --> 09:55.200
That's none of your damn business!

09:55.200 --> 09:57.680
Objection. This entire line
of questioning violates...

09:57.680 --> 09:59.480
Sustained.

09:59.480 --> 10:00.960
You're a little late, Mr Ashman.

10:00.960 --> 10:04.960
Jury will disregard
Dr Martin's answer.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
Why did you wait three weeks
to report it?

10:13.280 --> 10:15.080
He said...

10:15.080 --> 10:17.080
he'd kill me.

10:17.080 --> 10:21.080
How come you changed your mind
and decided to accuse Dr White?

10:24.880 --> 10:28.880
Because...

10:30.560 --> 10:34.160
..I didn't want other women
to suffer...

10:34.160 --> 10:35.280
..the way I have.

10:35.280 --> 10:39.280
I have no further questions.

10:44.280 --> 10:46.480
Have you been having
these fevers mostly at night?

10:46.480 --> 10:48.120
Headaches, nausea.

10:48.120 --> 10:50.120
Yeah, I have been feeling
awfully tired.

10:50.120 --> 10:51.720
Have you had problems
with your eyes?

10:51.720 --> 10:53.240
Any blurring or double vision?

10:53.240 --> 10:56.400
Only when my kids start acting up.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.080
I bet they're excited
about the baby.

10:58.080 --> 11:00.720
Yeah, that's all they talk about.

11:00.720 --> 11:04.720
OK, let me just listen here.

11:06.760 --> 11:10.760
Can I see your hands, please?

11:12.400 --> 11:15.760
We were moving some keypunch
equipment at work last week.

11:15.760 --> 11:19.160
Patty, see if you can get her chart
from the prenatal clinic, OK?

11:19.160 --> 11:21.680
Sure.  Thanks.

11:21.680 --> 11:25.680
Take her right over there.

11:26.040 --> 11:28.240
Mrs Chambers?

11:28.240 --> 11:29.320
Yes.

11:29.320 --> 11:31.920
Wayne, could I talk to you
for a moment, please?

11:31.920 --> 11:35.920
Sure. Excuse me.

11:37.280 --> 11:40.520
Look, I've seen her a couple
of times in the prenatal clinic.

11:40.520 --> 11:42.600
She is always coming up
with some new complaint.

11:42.600 --> 11:43.720
She's your patient?

11:43.720 --> 11:44.800
She's a clinic patient.

11:44.800 --> 11:47.280
I happened to be on last week
when she came in for a check-up.

11:47.280 --> 11:49.640
Did you see the splinter
haemorrhages under her nails?

11:49.640 --> 11:51.480
No. Look,

11:51.480 --> 11:52.720
she is mildly anaemic,

11:52.720 --> 11:55.200
she probably hasn't taken
the iron pills they gave her.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.200
What about the murmur
in the tricuspid valve?

11:57.200 --> 11:58.360
I didn't hear it.

11:58.360 --> 11:59.560
And the spots on her retina?

11:59.560 --> 12:01.520
Look, we're getting stacked
up out there.

12:01.520 --> 12:03.720
Take my word for it,
she's as healthy as you are.

12:03.720 --> 12:06.720
You're probably right, but I'd like
to admit her for observation.

12:06.720 --> 12:08.640
I'd appreciate it
if you'd get a consult.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.760
Wendy, I realise your antsy
about testifying...

12:10.760 --> 12:11.800
Yeah, wouldn't you be?

12:11.800 --> 12:13.920
I haven't heard from the DA,
will they call me?

12:13.920 --> 12:16.240
How am I supposed to know?
I'm no legal expert!

12:16.240 --> 12:17.080
OK.

12:17.080 --> 12:18.120
OK.

12:18.120 --> 12:18.600
OK.

12:18.600 --> 12:21.360
OK.

12:21.360 --> 12:22.520
Nothing we can't handle.

12:22.520 --> 12:25.400
Good, just cut out the bickering.

12:25.400 --> 12:29.400
Look, she is a moaner, groaner and
there is no reason to tie up a bed.

12:30.840 --> 12:32.920
Chronic hypochondriasis?

12:32.920 --> 12:34.040
That's my diagnosis.

12:34.040 --> 12:35.960
Fine, you covered your rear end,

12:35.960 --> 12:39.960
that's always been
your greatest strength.

12:43.280 --> 12:47.280
Aunt Charise?

12:48.760 --> 12:49.840
Hello?

12:49.840 --> 12:51.440
Leaving town before the boards?

12:51.440 --> 12:53.040
I wish. Have you seen
my aunt Charise?

12:53.040 --> 12:54.440
What does she look like?

12:54.440 --> 12:58.440
She, um... You didn't see her,
you'd remember.

12:59.080 --> 13:00.400
Ehrlich.

13:00.400 --> 13:04.400
E-H-R-L-I-C-H.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.280
Now, he's a wonderful doctor.

13:06.280 --> 13:10.280
Do you know that when he was eight
he would take frogs apart

13:10.320 --> 13:12.480
and sew them back together?

13:12.480 --> 13:16.480
Do you know that once I took him
to this farm in Sonoma.

13:19.840 --> 13:23.840
Well, there was this pig...

13:27.320 --> 13:28.480
You should call a code.

13:28.480 --> 13:29.560
Aunt Charise!

13:29.560 --> 13:30.600
Victor!

13:30.600 --> 13:33.120
Hi. I've been looking everywhere
for you. What's all this?

13:33.120 --> 13:35.000
Mr Kopeski couldn't take
the excitement.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.440
He's OK, he just fainted.

13:36.440 --> 13:37.560
Get an ammonium capsule.

13:37.560 --> 13:38.600
OK.

13:38.600 --> 13:41.520
I was just telling him about your
childhood, about the frogs and all.

13:41.520 --> 13:43.800
Victor, we should schedule
a session about the pig.

13:43.800 --> 13:45.400
You told them about the pig?

13:45.400 --> 13:47.960
Victor, it is so good to see you.

13:47.960 --> 13:51.960
Yeah.

13:52.200 --> 13:53.840
You are looking for me, Phil?

13:53.840 --> 13:56.760
Yes, I'm just trying
to get on top of this case

13:56.760 --> 13:58.920
I inherited from Dr Helfmann.

13:58.920 --> 14:01.200
Frankly, I don't see
anything unusual.

14:01.200 --> 14:03.600
But then you would know a lot
more about him than I do.

14:03.600 --> 14:06.320
Have you had much experience
with iatrogenic diseases?

14:06.320 --> 14:07.880
Unfortunately.

14:07.880 --> 14:11.160
Doctor-caused illness
is far too common.

14:11.160 --> 14:14.480
Well, I was going over all the lab
reports Dr Helfmann ordered.

14:14.480 --> 14:18.360
It suddenly occurred to me that
every one of Mr Kremmins' symptoms

14:18.360 --> 14:21.840
could also be a side effect
of the medication he was given.

14:21.840 --> 14:23.560
Including the neurological problem?

14:23.560 --> 14:25.240
He was given an awful lot
of Compazine.

14:25.240 --> 14:28.480
100 mg over the past three days.

14:28.480 --> 14:30.520
So, you could take him
off everything.

14:30.520 --> 14:34.520
Yes. And run the risk that he could
easily kick into a stroke.

14:36.840 --> 14:40.840
It is a tricky thing, Phil, but
no-one can do the thinking for you.

14:40.880 --> 14:44.880
I'm afraid it's the kind of choice
you'll have to get used to making.

14:48.600 --> 14:52.600
'Nurse Rowe, ER.
Nurse Helen Rowe, ER.'

14:55.600 --> 14:57.560
What? It can't be that bad.

14:57.560 --> 15:00.280
I've got Westphall and Auschlander
contradicting each other.

15:00.280 --> 15:01.960
Both of them looking
over my shoulder.

15:01.960 --> 15:03.000
Catch-22.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.280
There's no way I can avoid
not looking bad to someone.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.480
Relax, Phil,
you can always get a job running...

15:07.480 --> 15:11.480
a carwash.

15:31.520 --> 15:33.400
Have you reached a verdict?

15:33.400 --> 15:34.920
We have, Your Honour.

15:34.920 --> 15:38.920
Will the defendant please rise?

15:41.400 --> 15:44.600
How do you find as to the defendant,
Peter White?

15:44.600 --> 15:48.600
On the first count of rape,
we find the defendant not guilty.

15:49.760 --> 15:53.760
On the second count of rape,
we find the defendant not guilty.

15:56.520 --> 16:00.520
On the third count of rape,
we find the defendant not guilty.

16:04.240 --> 16:08.240
On a single count of assault,
we find the defendant not guilty.

16:13.760 --> 16:17.760
Case dismissed.

16:22.360 --> 16:26.360
One for the books.

16:26.640 --> 16:28.480
How did you do it?

16:28.480 --> 16:29.800
Do what?

16:29.800 --> 16:32.640
Criminal justice is a lot
like Donkey Kong, Dr White.

16:32.640 --> 16:35.800
How come you didn't get hit
with the bricks?

16:35.800 --> 16:38.480
Why do you think I wanted you
on my side this time after the way

16:38.480 --> 16:40.520
you chopped me up in
the entrapment hearing?

16:40.520 --> 16:43.280
I'm not saying I did
a lousy job here,

16:43.280 --> 16:47.280
although the DA certainly did, not
even calling Fiscus to the stand.

16:48.960 --> 16:51.240
The jury knew what it was doing.

16:51.240 --> 16:53.640
They were also impressed
with the fact that you passed

16:53.640 --> 16:57.360
the lie detector test.

16:57.360 --> 17:01.360
How did you pull that off?

17:03.440 --> 17:06.880
I read in a book somewhere that
it's the questions that set off

17:06.880 --> 17:10.079
the involuntary response,
not the answers.

17:10.079 --> 17:14.079
So, I just sat there and listened
to the questions very carefully...

17:15.720 --> 17:18.440
..and then I told the truth.

17:18.440 --> 17:21.880
Congratulations.

17:21.880 --> 17:25.880
I wonder how you are going
to live with it.

17:28.760 --> 17:32.760
CLASSICAL MUSIC

17:38.560 --> 17:42.560
Wendy, turn that thing off. &gt;

17:58.640 --> 18:02.640
I lost my appetite after
I testified, so I skipped lunch.

18:06.680 --> 18:08.920
At least,
I'm not smoking or drinking.

18:08.920 --> 18:11.480
Sugar fix.

18:11.480 --> 18:14.240
Don't overdo it.

18:14.240 --> 18:17.040
It was awful being on the stand.

18:17.040 --> 18:18.480
Yeah.

18:18.480 --> 18:20.960
That DA was pathetic.

18:20.960 --> 18:24.960
He didn't even have
the medical records there.

18:25.040 --> 18:29.040
Now that it's over,
I feel like a different person,

18:29.280 --> 18:33.280
as if I'd been through
some sort of catharsis.

18:33.960 --> 18:37.200
I'm glad I testified.

18:37.200 --> 18:41.200
That's how I would like to feel,
different.

18:42.320 --> 18:45.680
When I was a kid,
I had one thought in my head -

18:45.680 --> 18:48.480
to get out of my hometown.

18:48.480 --> 18:51.960
You see, medicine was going
to be my magic carpet.

18:51.960 --> 18:54.680
Where did you grow up?

18:54.680 --> 18:56.240
Tallahassee.

18:56.240 --> 19:00.240
Not too many Asians there,
or girls with a lot of ambition.

19:02.280 --> 19:06.280
I guess I didn't have
as many choices as other kids.

19:06.720 --> 19:09.200
That's a dumb excuse, isn't it?

19:09.200 --> 19:13.200
Wendy, take it easy on yourself.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.440
I mean, I turned out great, right?

19:16.440 --> 19:19.600
Yeah.

19:19.600 --> 19:22.320
So, how come I don't feel so great?

19:22.320 --> 19:24.080
If it's not one thing, it's another.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.200
It is not rounds, it's ER

19:26.200 --> 19:30.200
or some cry-baby patient
or tests or getting beat up.

19:31.600 --> 19:35.600
Where does my satisfaction come in?

19:36.760 --> 19:40.760
Stupid...stupid waste
of eight years. I'm fed up.

19:42.400 --> 19:46.400
Did you ever want to be
anything else?

19:47.560 --> 19:50.680
Don't laugh.

19:50.680 --> 19:53.200
A dancer.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.720
What happened?

19:54.720 --> 19:58.720
'Dr Armstrong, 5542.
Dr Wendy Armstrong, 5542.'

19:59.440 --> 20:01.000
I wasn't good enough.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.600
How come?

20:02.600 --> 20:04.520
Too fat.

20:04.520 --> 20:07.120
And the kids called me tutu face.

20:07.120 --> 20:10.960
Armstrong.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.320
When?

20:13.320 --> 20:14.800
No, I will be right there.

20:14.800 --> 20:16.560
Watch that for me, would you?

20:16.560 --> 20:20.560
Sure.

20:27.160 --> 20:30.720
Hiya, Wendy.

20:30.720 --> 20:34.720
Come on, come on!

20:40.040 --> 20:43.680
Five, six, seven, eight, nine,
ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

20:43.680 --> 20:45.760
Let's get a better seal on the mask.
Suction.

20:45.760 --> 20:49.760
Nine, ten, ll, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.880
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten, 11,

20:58.880 --> 21:00.720
12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

21:00.720 --> 21:03.040
Still blue, no response.

21:03.040 --> 21:04.440
Annie, what happened?

21:04.440 --> 21:08.440
Five, six, seven, eight.

21:11.560 --> 21:14.640
Mrs Chambers went into spontaneous
labour 20 minutes ago.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.760
You did a C-section?
What about the baby?

21:16.760 --> 21:18.760
The baby is dead.

21:18.760 --> 21:21.040
What if I call
Neonatal Intensive Care?

21:21.040 --> 21:24.680
Wendy, we never even heard a cry.

21:24.680 --> 21:28.680
Let's re-gown and glove,
get ready to close.

21:42.200 --> 21:46.200
Why defend such a dumb mistake
when you're so obviously wrong?

21:46.200 --> 21:48.080
Armstrong is a perfectionist.

21:48.080 --> 21:49.760
I get it,
that's why she stonewalled me

21:49.760 --> 21:51.880
after overlooking
half of Mrs Chambers' history.

21:51.880 --> 21:54.800
Don't tell me
you never tried to cover your tracks.

21:54.800 --> 21:58.360
I'm sick of Wendy. I mean, she is
more trouble than she's worth.

21:58.360 --> 22:01.600
She's probably saying
the same thing about you.

22:01.600 --> 22:04.520
'Mr Klein, utility room, 4 West.'

22:04.520 --> 22:06.920
So, when Victor and I came
into the cafeteria,

22:06.920 --> 22:10.920
and then I saw you across the room,
I nearly dropped my tray.

22:11.160 --> 22:13.560
Do you remember our talk
at Victor's wedding?

22:13.560 --> 22:14.680
How could I forget it?

22:14.680 --> 22:17.000
I told Aunt Charise
about Roberta and I breaking up.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.920
She came all this way
just to console me.

22:18.920 --> 22:19.960
Some consolation(!)

22:19.960 --> 22:22.120
Excuse me, you'll be
at the mortality conference?

22:22.120 --> 22:23.760
Six sharp.  That sounds awful.

22:23.760 --> 22:26.440
Dr Westphall, this is
my aunt Charise from California.

22:26.440 --> 22:27.520
Oh, nice to meet you.

22:27.520 --> 22:29.840
Oh, please, join us.

22:29.840 --> 22:33.120
Oh, boy.  Thank you.

22:33.120 --> 22:35.360
I don't remember you
from the wedding.

22:35.360 --> 22:38.240
No, I'm afraid I couldn't make it,
I was stuck here at the hospital.

22:38.240 --> 22:42.080
Oh. You know, they ended up getting
married in the emergency room.

22:42.080 --> 22:43.920
You could have just come downstairs.

22:43.920 --> 22:46.080
Are you married?

22:46.080 --> 22:47.800
Aunt Charise, come on.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.920
No, that's OK.
My wife died some time ago.

22:49.920 --> 22:52.000
Oh, I am so sorry.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.320
Well, listen, Aunt Charise
didn't get to see much

22:54.320 --> 22:55.720
of the city last time.

22:55.720 --> 22:58.320
With your schedule, she won't see
much of it this time either.

22:58.320 --> 23:01.600
You know, I've lived in Boston most
of my life, it still surprises me.

23:01.600 --> 23:04.160
I love surprises.

23:04.160 --> 23:08.160
Well, I'm sure Dr Westphall
will be delighted to show you

23:08.280 --> 23:09.400
some of the sights.

23:09.400 --> 23:10.440
Really?

23:10.440 --> 23:12.720
That would be wonderful.
You mean, like tonight?

23:12.720 --> 23:15.880
Unfortunately, I won't be out
of here until 8:00 at least.

23:15.880 --> 23:17.360
Oh.

23:17.360 --> 23:21.360
I can wait.

23:23.880 --> 23:26.840
Well, maybe if you had shown up
for the preliminary hearing,

23:26.840 --> 23:28.520
they wouldn't have cut White's bail.

23:28.520 --> 23:30.480
If there's one thing
I don't need right now

23:30.480 --> 23:32.160
it's another cross-examination.

23:32.160 --> 23:34.320
You'd think, with all the women
Peter had...

23:34.320 --> 23:35.360
I know.

23:35.360 --> 23:37.960
He's one of the last guys
I would've picked for a rapist.

23:37.960 --> 23:41.960
You wouldn't defend him
if he hadn't done you a favour.

23:42.080 --> 23:45.120
Such as?

23:45.120 --> 23:47.240
Perjuring himself
in the entrapment case.

23:47.240 --> 23:48.840
You came out of that all right.

23:48.840 --> 23:51.360
Look, the cafeteria is
not a great place to discuss this.

23:51.360 --> 23:53.880
Maybe White picked up
on your signals, Cathy -

23:53.880 --> 23:55.880
body language, reputation.

23:55.880 --> 23:57.600
You saying I led him on?

23:57.600 --> 23:58.760
That's ridiculous.

23:58.760 --> 24:00.480
You made it
with half the men here.

24:00.480 --> 24:03.680
Including Wayne Fiscus.
Sorry I came between the two of you.

24:03.680 --> 24:04.640
Cathy, take it easy.

24:04.640 --> 24:06.440
Cathy, take it easy.

24:06.440 --> 24:08.840
I wonder what you would've said
had Peter White asked you

24:08.840 --> 24:09.920
to sleep with him.

24:09.920 --> 24:13.920
I'd have said no.

24:14.040 --> 24:18.040
No.

24:27.880 --> 24:31.880
The autopsy results showed end-stage
cirrhosis with fibrotic regeneration

24:32.080 --> 24:33.400
throughout the liver.

24:33.400 --> 24:35.040
The cause of death -

24:35.040 --> 24:38.120
massive haemorrhaging
from oesophageal varices.

24:38.120 --> 24:41.000
Restricted to dietary sodium
and fluids?

24:41.000 --> 24:42.040
Yes.

24:42.040 --> 24:44.960
Why did Dr Penning
recommend vasopressin?

24:44.960 --> 24:47.040
Because the Blakemore tube
didn't work.

24:47.040 --> 24:50.400
The patient also suffered
from jandis, pleural effusion

24:50.400 --> 24:52.800
and intermittent obstruction
of the bowel.

24:52.800 --> 24:56.800
Questions?

24:57.720 --> 25:01.680
Did you consider a cervical shunt?

25:01.680 --> 25:03.240
The patient was 83 years old.

25:03.240 --> 25:06.280
The risk of surgical mortality
was totally unacceptable.

25:06.280 --> 25:09.640
I think that's very clear.

25:09.640 --> 25:12.160
Anything else?
All right, thank you, Dr Wade.

25:12.160 --> 25:14.920
Get the lights for us, please.

25:14.920 --> 25:16.880
It never lets up, does it?

25:16.880 --> 25:18.080
Uh-uh.

25:18.080 --> 25:19.880
One more case to go.

25:19.880 --> 25:23.880
This is our last mortality conference
before the National Boards.

25:24.240 --> 25:25.720
It has been a long day,

25:25.720 --> 25:28.080
I know it, and I know you all
want to get home and study.

25:28.080 --> 25:29.160
Amen.

25:29.160 --> 25:31.920
But I just wanted to wish you all
the very best of luck.

25:31.920 --> 25:35.920
And I'm sure you're going to be
surprised at how much you now.

25:36.480 --> 25:39.240
Dr Fiscus.

25:39.240 --> 25:42.640
Chambers, baby boy,
delivered three months premature.

25:42.640 --> 25:44.600
Apgar score, zero out of ten.

25:44.600 --> 25:47.480
Infant succumbed
well before parturition.

25:47.480 --> 25:50.040
Your initial diagnosis
on the mother was anaemia?

25:50.040 --> 25:53.200
Well, not exactly.

25:53.200 --> 25:55.680
It says so right here.

25:55.680 --> 25:57.720
That was my diagnosis.

25:57.720 --> 26:00.920
I saw Mrs Chambers
originally in the prenatal clinic.

26:00.920 --> 26:04.040
Then Dr Fiscus dealt with her
for the first time yesterday?

26:04.040 --> 26:05.680
That's right.

26:05.680 --> 26:08.920
Well, when he picked up
on the tricuspid murmur in ER,

26:08.920 --> 26:10.640
you didn't rethink?

26:10.640 --> 26:12.680
I didn't hear the murmur.

26:12.680 --> 26:15.920
You overlooked a history
of rheumatic fever and you

26:15.920 --> 26:19.880
referred Mrs Chambers to a dental
clinic for chronic gingivitis.

26:19.880 --> 26:22.360
It didn't seem that severe.

26:22.360 --> 26:24.120
Oh, boy.

26:24.120 --> 26:26.080
Something to contribute,
Dr Chandler?

26:26.080 --> 26:27.720
No, sir.

26:27.720 --> 26:31.080
Then, in short, Dr Armstrong, you
never acknowledged the possibility

26:31.080 --> 26:32.520
of a genuine heart condition,

26:32.520 --> 26:34.600
in this case,
infective endocarditus,

26:34.600 --> 26:38.600
which crossed the placenta
and triggered premature labour.

26:40.680 --> 26:42.520
I...

26:42.520 --> 26:44.520
I...

26:44.520 --> 26:48.520
To be honest, Mrs Chambers'
valve murmur was almost inaudible.

26:51.520 --> 26:53.360
I must have big ears.

26:53.360 --> 26:56.520
It hardly seems the time
for wisecracks.

26:56.520 --> 27:00.520
I'm sorry.

27:00.520 --> 27:04.520
I'm having trouble concentrating.
I was in court earlier today...

27:04.920 --> 27:06.600
I think we all understand that,
Wendy.

27:06.600 --> 27:09.360
The point is had you spotted her
condition earlier in the clinic,

27:09.360 --> 27:11.440
she could have been put
on IV antibiotics.

27:11.440 --> 27:15.440
And probably she'd still be
carrying that child.

27:16.360 --> 27:17.400
Yeah.

27:17.400 --> 27:21.000
(SOBS)

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
That's all.

27:46.600 --> 27:48.680
That was fun(!)

27:48.680 --> 27:50.960
I'm just glad none of my patients
died this week.

27:50.960 --> 27:52.920
I'm telling you.
Let me ask you something.

27:52.920 --> 27:56.640
If you had an instinct about a case,

27:56.640 --> 27:59.720
even though you knew there was
nothing to back it up medically,

27:59.720 --> 28:01.160
which way would you go?

28:01.160 --> 28:02.400
I'd go by the book.

28:02.400 --> 28:04.680
You're the last person
I ever thought would say that.

28:04.680 --> 28:07.720
I know, me, too.

28:07.720 --> 28:10.120
I don't like what this pressure
is doing to me.

28:10.120 --> 28:12.800
I don't like what
it's doing to any of us.

28:12.800 --> 28:14.680
Desperate to impress.

28:14.680 --> 28:17.160
I know I would do anything
to be asked back next year,

28:17.160 --> 28:19.720
especially after screwing up
all year long.

28:19.720 --> 28:23.720
But what the...?

28:25.120 --> 28:27.920
I'm going to go home
and take care of Pete. Good night.

28:27.920 --> 28:31.920
Good night.

28:51.760 --> 28:55.360
I am changing Mr Kremmins'
medication order.

28:55.360 --> 28:59.360
I want neuro checks every half hour.

29:01.400 --> 29:05.400
And I am taking him off everything,
starting right now.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.280
I tell you what, give me A through H,
you take I through P.

29:18.280 --> 29:19.920
And we'll leave the rest for Daniel.

29:19.920 --> 29:20.960
Fine.

29:20.960 --> 29:23.280
That way he gets
Peter White's folder.

29:23.280 --> 29:25.680
Mm. We'll trade around
over the weekend

29:25.680 --> 29:27.800
and make the cut decisions
on Monday.

29:27.800 --> 29:28.920
KNOCKING

29:28.920 --> 29:32.280
KNOCKING

29:32.280 --> 29:33.520
Well, hello again.

29:33.520 --> 29:36.640
Hi. Boston At Night.

29:36.640 --> 29:40.240
I thought you might be able to give
me a few pointers on where to go.

29:40.240 --> 29:42.640
I have the perfect suggestion(!)

29:42.640 --> 29:46.520
I just mean that Victor, you know,
is busy, you're busy...

29:46.520 --> 29:48.760
I'm busy.

29:48.760 --> 29:52.760
Yeah, so I thought I might just try
a night on the town by myself.

29:54.080 --> 29:55.760
Well, I would love to show
you around,

29:55.760 --> 29:57.520
but I'm going to be home
with my kids.

29:57.520 --> 29:59.320
Come on, Donald,
what's the big deal?

29:59.320 --> 30:01.040
Put another TV dinner in the oven.

30:01.040 --> 30:03.200
That's funny cos, you now,

30:03.200 --> 30:07.200
I love TV dinners. What time?

30:07.720 --> 30:09.960
8:30.

30:09.960 --> 30:12.080
Oh, 8:30 is perfect.
That's just perfect. OK.

30:12.080 --> 30:14.240
8:30, yeah.

30:14.240 --> 30:18.240
I'm so excited! I'm so excited!

30:18.840 --> 30:20.560
Bye.

30:20.560 --> 30:23.400
One suggestion,

30:23.400 --> 30:27.400
lock the liquor cabinet.

30:31.560 --> 30:33.600
Hi. You look terrific.

30:33.600 --> 30:35.160
Why, thanks, I feel terrific.

30:35.160 --> 30:37.600
No more regrets about having
a breast implant?

30:37.600 --> 30:40.960
Yeah, there are some. But do you
want to know something, Michael?

30:40.960 --> 30:42.680
After everything
I've been through,

30:42.680 --> 30:45.120
I feel like I can get through
anything else blindfolded.

30:45.120 --> 30:48.040
Well, it's good to have you back
at your battle station.

30:48.040 --> 30:48.600
Thanks.

30:48.600 --> 30:52.600
Thanks.

30:59.920 --> 31:02.880
Yeah, can I help you?

31:02.880 --> 31:04.680
Hi, Helen.

31:04.680 --> 31:08.680
Have you seen Jack Morrison?

31:09.080 --> 31:13.080
I think he went to Oncol.

31:35.280 --> 31:36.920
Peter.

31:36.920 --> 31:38.600
They acquitted me.

31:38.600 --> 31:40.680
Are you serious?

31:40.680 --> 31:43.240
Even heard it on the radio.

31:43.240 --> 31:44.440
The assault charge, too?

31:44.440 --> 31:46.200
The whole shooting match.

31:46.200 --> 31:48.760
Now, there's still some creep
running around out in the city

31:48.760 --> 31:52.400
that deserves to be shot,
but it's a big city.

31:52.400 --> 31:54.280
In other words,
Wendy and Cathy are both...

31:54.280 --> 31:56.920
Don't expect me
to forgive those two.

31:56.920 --> 32:00.920
I mean, somebody raped them,
all right, but it wasn't me.

32:04.400 --> 32:08.400
Well, I don't know what to say,
Peter.

32:09.200 --> 32:11.760
I mean, I'm glad.
You had a really rough time.

32:11.760 --> 32:13.920
It has been one raw deal
after another.

32:13.920 --> 32:17.920
But finally, finally something
has turned out all right.

32:19.520 --> 32:20.920
Well, I got to get cracking.

32:20.920 --> 32:23.080
I've got boards tomorrow
just like everybody.

32:23.080 --> 32:24.840
Yeah.

32:24.840 --> 32:28.840
Be happy for me, man. Come on.

32:31.280 --> 32:32.520
I'll see you later.

32:32.520 --> 32:36.520
OK.

32:44.480 --> 32:46.200
Donald.

32:46.200 --> 32:47.560
What's up?

32:47.560 --> 32:49.560
I want you to see something.

32:49.560 --> 32:52.560
Do you recall a case in rounds this
morning, a patient of Chandler's.

32:52.560 --> 32:55.600
Mr Kremmins, some sort
of central nervous system defect.

32:55.600 --> 32:59.600
It's quite remarkable.

33:09.280 --> 33:11.400
So it was the Compazine.

33:11.400 --> 33:13.120
And the heparin before that.

33:13.120 --> 33:15.120
What about the chest pain?

33:15.120 --> 33:17.160
Chandler had some new films taken.

33:17.160 --> 33:21.160
Apparently,
he cracked rib in a fall last week.

33:21.480 --> 33:25.400
Keeps you humble, doesn't it?

33:25.400 --> 33:26.520
Sure does.

33:26.520 --> 33:29.240
This morning I chewed
Phil out over Mr Kremmins' treatment

33:29.240 --> 33:30.760
look how it turned out.

33:30.760 --> 33:33.280
The man could have been patched up
with adhesive tape

33:33.280 --> 33:35.040
and he damn near has a stroke.

33:35.040 --> 33:37.600
Good thing Phil Chandler
saw it for what it was.

33:37.600 --> 33:40.440
At times a young doctor
can show us the way.

33:40.440 --> 33:44.320
Thank heaven, three faces looking
forward to their evening.

33:44.320 --> 33:45.440
Vijay has convinced us,

33:45.440 --> 33:48.680
we're going to try a new Indian
restaurant in Braintree he swears by.

33:48.680 --> 33:50.840
Shrimp vindaloo,
the best in New England.

33:50.840 --> 33:52.240
That's not saying much, is it?

33:52.240 --> 33:54.480
I guess everyone else
is hitting the books tonight.

33:54.480 --> 33:55.520
Count your blessings.

33:55.520 --> 33:56.360
Uh-huh. Good night.

33:56.360 --> 33:58.920
Uh-huh. Good night.

33:58.920 --> 34:02.920
When I was a resident, there were
fewer than 1,500 diagnostic tests,

34:03.040 --> 34:04.480
now there are more than 15,000.

34:04.480 --> 34:06.360
Uh-huh. Some of them invaluable.

34:06.360 --> 34:09.000
Like the one that could have saved
Dora Chambers' baby.

34:09.000 --> 34:12.760
I'm just saying, there's a tendency
to rely too much on technology.

34:12.760 --> 34:14.120
To misuse it, I do it myself.

34:14.120 --> 34:17.760
Our residency programme reflects
that bias, don't you think?

34:17.760 --> 34:20.760
Of course it does, and frankly,
we don't have any choice.

34:20.760 --> 34:21.960
I was looking for you.

34:21.960 --> 34:23.320
Why?

34:23.320 --> 34:25.199
Well, I know you both thought
I was guilty.

34:25.199 --> 34:26.239
Now the trial is over,

34:26.239 --> 34:28.719
I wanted to let you know
there are no hard feelings.

34:28.719 --> 34:29.960
That's big of you(!)

34:29.960 --> 34:32.159
Well, with evaluations coming up,

34:32.159 --> 34:34.639
I just wanted to make sure
I got a clean shot.

34:34.639 --> 34:36.560
I mean, I'm innocent.

34:36.560 --> 34:38.280
And it's only fair.

34:38.280 --> 34:41.159
You are entitled to
the benefit of the doubt.

34:41.159 --> 34:43.520
That's what I wanted to hear.

34:43.520 --> 34:47.520
Good night.

34:53.520 --> 34:56.440
Cut the crap, Jack!

34:56.440 --> 34:58.720
I mean, you're his real good buddy,
aren't you?

34:58.720 --> 35:02.720
You probably welcomed him
back with a big kiss.

35:19.600 --> 35:21.120
'..shortly after midnight

35:21.120 --> 35:25.120
'and reportedly blew out
windows as far as two blocks away.

35:25.320 --> 35:27.440
'Tensions have been high
in this neighbourhood

35:27.440 --> 35:30.760
'and it's likely a curfew
will once again be enforced.

35:30.760 --> 35:33.920
'In an effort to prevent
those incidents of violence,

35:33.920 --> 35:37.920
'senior officials said plans
call for disengagement.'

36:23.960 --> 36:26.400
Hey, Dad, don't do that,
I'll get it later.

36:26.400 --> 36:28.840
All right.

36:28.840 --> 36:30.400
She sure talks a lot, doesn't she?

36:30.400 --> 36:33.560
Yeah.

36:33.560 --> 36:35.200
Hi. &gt;

36:35.200 --> 36:36.840
So, where was I?

36:36.840 --> 36:38.240
Ah...um...

36:38.240 --> 36:41.800
Could I have just a touch more wine?
Just a touch.

36:41.800 --> 36:44.640
Sure.

36:44.640 --> 36:46.120
Oh, perfect.

36:46.120 --> 36:50.080
OK...

36:50.080 --> 36:54.080
So, my advice to Victor

36:54.240 --> 36:58.240
every time he wrote
or called was...

36:58.640 --> 37:00.400
shop around.

37:00.400 --> 37:01.560
Right.

37:01.560 --> 37:05.200
Look before you leap.

37:05.200 --> 37:06.240
Absolutely.

37:06.240 --> 37:08.000
But he didn't listen.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.040
No.

37:09.040 --> 37:12.160
No wonder the marriage was a bust.

37:12.160 --> 37:16.160
Right?

37:16.560 --> 37:17.720
Coffee, Dad?

37:17.720 --> 37:19.720
Yes, thank you. How about you?

37:19.720 --> 37:22.080
Oh, no. This is just fine.

37:22.080 --> 37:23.960
Really just fine, really.

37:23.960 --> 37:26.600
Besides, I'm not driving
or anything like that.

37:26.600 --> 37:28.120
Oh, Lizzie.

37:28.120 --> 37:32.120
Oh, Lizzie, dinner was fantastic.

37:32.120 --> 37:33.520
Thanks.

37:33.520 --> 37:35.880
Thank God for that one.

37:35.880 --> 37:39.880
She really holds down the fort.
For the next few months, anyway.

37:41.120 --> 37:42.600
Then what?

37:42.600 --> 37:44.200
Oh, I start Vassar in the fall.

37:44.200 --> 37:45.760
Oh, Lizzie!

37:45.760 --> 37:47.080
How good!

37:47.080 --> 37:49.880
What happens to the fort?

37:49.880 --> 37:51.920
I guess I manage by myself.

37:51.920 --> 37:53.600
Tommy is asleep, is he?

37:53.600 --> 37:55.920
Yeah.

37:55.920 --> 37:58.600
I'm all alone in California.

37:58.600 --> 38:02.600
Well, if I had my way,
I'd hang onto everything I have,

38:03.120 --> 38:05.760
keep my life just the way it is.

38:05.760 --> 38:09.080
But I have no choice,
kids grow up and they leave,

38:09.080 --> 38:11.960
and that's the way
it's supposed to be.

38:11.960 --> 38:14.640
So, I guess we just enjoy them
while we can.

38:14.640 --> 38:17.400
Does that mean I have to go
do the dishes now?

38:17.400 --> 38:19.680
Uh-huh.

38:19.680 --> 38:23.680
No.

38:25.320 --> 38:27.320
That's lovely.

38:27.320 --> 38:29.680
That's really lovely.

38:29.680 --> 38:32.280
Could you excuse me
for a few minutes, please?

38:32.280 --> 38:36.240
Sure.

38:36.240 --> 38:38.040
You know I change my mind, Dad?

38:38.040 --> 38:39.520
About what, pal?

38:39.520 --> 38:41.560
I know I said you should date more,

38:41.560 --> 38:44.600
maybe that's not such
a good idea after all.

38:44.600 --> 38:48.600
All right.

38:48.760 --> 38:52.320
Let's see.
Budd-Chiari syndrome.

38:52.320 --> 38:54.440
Budd Chiari,
lousy knuckleballer for the Mets.

38:54.440 --> 38:58.040
Shh. Signs are jaundice,
splenomegaly, ascites.

38:58.040 --> 39:01.760
Clinical signs may include
a prominent caudate lobe.

39:01.760 --> 39:04.640
Perfect. You get the Cy Young award.

39:04.640 --> 39:05.960
My turn.

39:05.960 --> 39:07.600
Your turn.

39:07.600 --> 39:10.800
All right, get this one right
and you make MVP.

39:10.800 --> 39:14.560
Paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia,
please.

39:14.560 --> 39:18.440
Thanks, Victor.

39:18.440 --> 39:21.400
OK. Heart rate, 160 up to 240.

39:21.400 --> 39:24.280
Occurs after mild cardio infarction.

39:24.280 --> 39:28.280
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
or mitral valve prolapse.

39:30.240 --> 39:34.240
Preventative drugs are quinidine,
lidocaine and, um...

39:36.840 --> 39:39.640
Try disopyramide.

39:39.640 --> 39:41.680
And don't forget digitalis.

39:41.680 --> 39:44.120
Dr Craig. We're doing a little
last-minute cramming.

39:44.120 --> 39:46.920
Well, if you don't know it now,
Ehrlich, you never will.

39:46.920 --> 39:50.760
I guess we figured you can always
pick something up last-minute.

39:50.760 --> 39:53.000
Well, you can never tell
about the National Boards.

39:53.000 --> 39:57.000
When I went in for mine in '63,
I was edgy as hell.

39:58.240 --> 40:02.240
When I came out, I was positive that
I accidentally skipped one box

40:03.120 --> 40:05.880
and filled in every answer wrong.

40:05.880 --> 40:07.840
No! Did you?

40:07.840 --> 40:11.840
No, no. In fact, I missed only one
question on the entire test.

40:13.120 --> 40:14.520
Do you remember the subject?

40:14.520 --> 40:18.520
How could I forget? Amnesia.

40:19.840 --> 40:23.360
Well, don't stay up too late.

40:23.360 --> 40:27.320
You are due in 8:30 sharp.

40:27.320 --> 40:28.760
Good night.

40:28.760 --> 40:31.480
Good night.

40:31.480 --> 40:34.400
That was nice. I feel better.

40:34.400 --> 40:36.160
I don't.

40:36.160 --> 40:40.160
Amnesia...

40:40.960 --> 40:43.280
'This concludes the broadcast day...'

40:43.280 --> 40:47.280
TOILET FLUSHING

41:24.320 --> 41:26.080
I wish I could have driven you.

41:26.080 --> 41:30.040
Victor, it's nearly 9 o'clock,
you've got a test to take.

41:30.040 --> 41:32.080
I worry about you in airports.

41:32.080 --> 41:33.240
I've got it all worked out.

41:33.240 --> 41:36.920
Hey, Victor. Oh, I loved
seeing you so much again.

41:36.920 --> 41:39.160
I love you, too,
I just wish I had more time.

41:39.160 --> 41:41.600
For once, Victor, will you
please shut up. Now come here.

41:41.600 --> 41:42.160
What?

41:42.160 --> 41:44.400
What?

41:44.400 --> 41:45.520
What, now?

41:45.520 --> 41:48.400
Victor, remember when
your mother and father died

41:48.400 --> 41:50.360
and you came to live with me
in Sonoma?

41:50.360 --> 41:51.360
Sure.

41:51.360 --> 41:54.240
Sure.

41:54.240 --> 41:56.400
when the man in the white suit
woke you up.

41:56.400 --> 41:58.440
The guy with the skinny moustache?

41:58.440 --> 41:59.480
Yeah, Ramon.

41:59.480 --> 42:02.320
And later on when you
asked me who he was?

42:02.320 --> 42:04.840
You said the milkman. Wasn't he?

42:04.840 --> 42:07.480
In a way.

42:07.480 --> 42:10.000
Ramon wasn't the only milkman.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.640
That's who all those guys were
coming in and out?

42:12.640 --> 42:14.600
I thought you had bad luck
with appliances.

42:14.600 --> 42:18.160
Why lay this on me now?

42:18.160 --> 42:21.880
Victor, look,
last night taught me a big lesson.

42:21.880 --> 42:25.880
I mean, there I was having
dinner at Dr Westphall's house

42:26.040 --> 42:28.000
and I broke my promise to myself,
I got drunk.

42:28.000 --> 42:32.000
And I acted as if he were just
another good-looking guy.

42:32.440 --> 42:36.200
And then when I got back to
the hotel, I said to myself,

42:36.200 --> 42:39.800
"Oh, my God, I've wrecked
Victor's chances."

42:39.800 --> 42:43.680
Aunt Charise, please don't say any
more, I'm teetering on the brink.

42:43.680 --> 42:45.320
So, I apologise.

42:45.320 --> 42:48.840
I don't want to spoil
your future at St Eligius,

42:48.840 --> 42:50.520
that's why I'm going home.

42:50.520 --> 42:52.480
But you'll come again soon?

42:52.480 --> 42:55.880
We have to live our own lives,
Victor.

42:55.880 --> 42:59.000
I mean, meeting once a year
maybe is bad enough.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.640
Oh, Aunt Charise, come on.

43:00.640 --> 43:03.880
Now you listen to me,
you must stop thinking of me

43:03.880 --> 43:07.880
as the person who just tucks
you in and makes you cocoa.

43:08.800 --> 43:12.800
And one more thing,
you quit moping around.

43:13.240 --> 43:17.240
And you just whoop it up!

43:17.800 --> 43:19.080
Meaning what?

43:19.080 --> 43:20.760
Meaning Roberta.

43:20.760 --> 43:23.560
Roberta was great for a while,

43:23.560 --> 43:26.440
but there are a lot of other
wonderful girls out there.

43:26.440 --> 43:29.040
So, stop feeling sorry for yourself.

43:29.040 --> 43:30.280
OK, OK, bye-bye.

43:30.280 --> 43:32.880
And Victor,
you just remember one more thing.

43:32.880 --> 43:36.880
As we speak,
your life is nearly half over.

43:37.680 --> 43:39.400
Now get moving.

43:39.400 --> 43:41.080
I will.

43:41.080 --> 43:44.680
You, too!

43:44.680 --> 43:45.880
Bye.

43:45.880 --> 43:49.880
Bye.

43:52.200 --> 43:56.000
You will have exactly four hours
for the morning section

43:56.000 --> 44:00.000
of the exam, with a 20 minute break
at 10:15.

44:01.240 --> 44:04.080
Books down there, please.

44:04.080 --> 44:05.400
Name?

44:05.400 --> 44:08.040
Victor Ehrlich.

44:08.040 --> 44:09.520
Seat 23.

44:09.520 --> 44:12.280
23.

44:12.280 --> 44:15.320
On this separate answer sheet
provided, you will note that

44:15.320 --> 44:19.320
each question number is followed
by five small rectangles.

44:19.320 --> 44:23.280
Using any standard number two pencil,

44:23.280 --> 44:26.240
blacken the rectangles
that correspond to the answer

44:26.240 --> 44:28.320
or answers you have chosen.

44:28.320 --> 44:32.160
Please be sure that you
totally fill the rectangles

44:32.160 --> 44:35.960
and that your erasures
are clean and complete.

44:35.960 --> 44:39.960
Do not break the seal
until I give the signal.

44:40.920 --> 44:44.920
Any questions?

44:56.480 --> 45:00.480
Begin.

45:07.760 --> 45:36.000
