00:02.000 --> 00:05.680
This programme contains some
violent scenes and strong language

00:05.680 --> 00:06.720
There's been another murder. I have
worries it's the same guy.

00:06.720 --> 00:09.560
I know where you live.
Like I've never heard that before.

00:13.120 --> 00:16.200
'You think her hair's been
clipped? Where?'

00:17.560 --> 00:18.680
There.

00:18.680 --> 00:22.560
'She has a high level of chorionic
gonadotropin in her blood.

00:22.560 --> 00:24.240
'I'm thinking she was pregnant.'

00:24.240 --> 00:25.840
Make me SIO.

00:25.840 --> 00:29.120
'This is the third
murder in three months, Jim.'

00:29.120 --> 00:32.320
Is this the body of your daughter
Sarah Kay?

00:32.320 --> 00:34.120
What are you doing?!

00:34.120 --> 00:36.960
'If we don't stop him he will
kill again.'

00:36.960 --> 00:39.240
Excuse me? Is this your purse?

00:40.480 --> 00:42.120
Oh, erm, thank you so much.

So who are you
thinking of for deputy SIOs?

02:23.880 --> 02:25.960
I'm not exactly spoiled for choice.

02:31.080 --> 02:32.120
Just answer.

02:34.240 --> 02:35.280
Brink...

02:38.560 --> 02:40.680
..and McElroy.

02:40.680 --> 02:42.880
McElroy?

02:42.880 --> 02:45.400
Good. That's good.

Burns.

02:54.840 --> 02:56.320
We'll be right there.

02:58.880 --> 03:01.440
There's been a fatal shooting.

03:01.440 --> 03:03.200
A police officer.

03:03.200 --> 03:05.240
We should get you
issued with a firearm.

03:05.240 --> 03:06.640
Book yourself in at the range.

03:06.640 --> 03:07.760
I don't have time.

03:07.760 --> 03:10.240
This is Belfast.

03:10.240 --> 03:11.680
Make time.

04:12.400 --> 04:15.280
I really don't want these
pictures to end up in the press.

04:15.280 --> 04:18.000
'The site can memorialise
the account.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.839
'That restricts profile access to
confirmed friends and family

04:20.839 --> 04:23.720
'but means people can still write
on Sarah's wall in remembrance.'

04:23.720 --> 04:27.240
I'd rather her father sent
in a formal request as next of kin

04:27.240 --> 04:29.080
and closed it down completely.

04:29.080 --> 04:32.560
'Yes I understand, ma'am.
I'll talk to him.'

04:32.560 --> 04:34.000
Right.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.720
Great, thank you.

04:40.400 --> 04:43.800
I spoke to Ian Kay about Friday
night's visit.

04:43.800 --> 04:47.960
He understands that it
was his daughter's decision not to

04:47.960 --> 04:49.600
take further action,

04:49.600 --> 04:54.080
so, if we can keep it out of the
press I think you're in the clear.

04:57.040 --> 04:58.760
Thank you, ma'am.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.280
I don't know whether you know that
there's been a shooting?

05:05.280 --> 05:07.040
A male police officer.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.360
I heard.

05:09.360 --> 05:12.240
Do you know him?
It's James Olson, ma'am.

05:12.240 --> 05:15.240
The Detective we saw
near the Falls Road on Sunday night.

05:19.280 --> 05:21.760
What happened?

05:21.760 --> 05:24.800
He was shot in the street outside
his house.

05:24.800 --> 05:27.320
Apparently it looks
like an assassination.

05:30.160 --> 05:31.720
I just wanted to say....

05:33.880 --> 05:36.920
..when I collected your things
from your hotel room,

05:36.920 --> 05:40.320
there were signs that you'd
had company.

05:40.320 --> 05:42.000
That a man had been there.

05:43.240 --> 05:46.280
I wanted you to know that
I removed those signs.

05:52.160 --> 05:54.880
Anything else? No, ma'am.

05:58.080 --> 05:59.720
Thank you.

06:20.280 --> 06:23.320
Can you confirm that it's a police
officer that's been killed?

06:23.320 --> 06:26.400
Has anyone claimed
responsibility for the shooting?

06:26.400 --> 06:28.960
Doesn't James Olson live round here?

06:28.960 --> 06:33.440
Move everyone back to the corner.
Seal off the entire street!

06:50.480 --> 06:52.760
Where's his family? Inside.

07:00.080 --> 07:01.600
Close this off.

07:36.440 --> 07:39.360
Can I call Mummy? She's at work.

07:43.520 --> 07:46.000
Why do you want
to call her?

07:46.000 --> 07:48.520
To say good morning.

07:48.520 --> 07:50.040
OK.

'God so loved us that he
gave himself up for us.

MAN MUMBLES ANGRILY

09:06.600 --> 09:09.360
HE SPEAKS GERMAN

09:09.360 --> 09:12.960
There's been an accident.
Fucking accident.

09:34.400 --> 09:35.600
It was an accident?

09:35.600 --> 09:37.560
Go back in there, sir.
Go back in inside.

09:37.560 --> 09:41.720
THEY SPEAK GERMAN

09:41.720 --> 09:43.680
Get some coffee down
your friend, sir.

09:45.440 --> 09:48.120
You're going to be OK,
you're going to be OK.

09:48.120 --> 09:49.160
Oh, my God!

09:49.160 --> 09:51.680
It's all right, she's going to be
OK. Don't get hysterical.

09:51.680 --> 09:52.840
Here, take her.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.320
Where the fuck are you?

10:07.320 --> 10:09.400
I could do with some
fucking help here.

to the mobile voice system...'

10:35.440 --> 10:37.480
You should arrest him.

10:37.480 --> 10:39.560
She must have said something.
Done something.

10:40.960 --> 10:42.920
She gets beaten up
and it's her fault?

10:42.920 --> 10:44.080
Not now, OK?

10:44.080 --> 10:45.640
He's a sadistic German pig.

10:45.640 --> 10:46.680
Not now!

10:47.920 --> 10:51.400
SHE SPEAKS RUSSIAN

10:51.400 --> 10:53.000
It's Rob Breedlove.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.400
'Where are you? I've been trying
to get hold of you.'

10:55.400 --> 10:57.520
I was asleep. What's wrong?

10:57.520 --> 11:00.720
'Then you haven't heard.
It's Jimmy.'

11:00.720 --> 11:02.720
'Jimmy Olson.'

11:02.720 --> 11:04.400
KNOCK AT DOOR

11:04.400 --> 11:06.080
Come in.

11:11.080 --> 11:12.720
What the fuck's going on out there?

11:12.720 --> 11:15.640
Your German friend has just
beaten up another girl.

11:15.640 --> 11:17.240
Badly?

11:17.240 --> 11:19.440
Split her lip. Marked her face.

11:19.440 --> 11:20.680
Christ.

11:21.840 --> 11:25.680
Jimmy Olson's been shot dead.
Right outside his home.

11:25.680 --> 11:26.720
I just called him.

11:28.280 --> 11:30.560
Another police officer
answered his phone.

11:30.560 --> 11:31.640
What phone did you use?

11:33.320 --> 11:34.400
I've dealt with it.

11:56.840 --> 11:58.520
Make sure you eat all your lunch.

11:58.520 --> 11:59.840
I will.

11:59.840 --> 12:02.400
I put in lots of crunchy
black beetles. Yummy!

12:02.400 --> 12:04.680
I love you. Love you, daddy.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.560
Take her here.

12:16.560 --> 12:17.680
Get her patched up.

12:18.800 --> 12:20.000
Pick her up later on.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.320
This bullshit has got to stop.

12:21.320 --> 12:23.040
I thought that's what
you were here for.

12:25.600 --> 12:26.880
Get this place cleaned up.

12:32.880 --> 12:34.400
Come on! Hurry the fuck up!

12:36.520 --> 12:39.440
He drills and it's in,
drills and it's in. And again.

12:39.440 --> 12:42.160
No response. Where's the boys.
Nobody to be seen.

12:42.160 --> 12:44.400
Just keeps on going and going.
That's the way it went.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.920
As you may have heard,
we're setting up a Task Force.

12:48.920 --> 12:50.960
I'm going to need a right-hand man.

12:50.960 --> 12:52.600
I'd like it to be you.

12:52.600 --> 12:55.880
It would mean to start right away.
No going home, no sleep.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.080
OK.

13:03.080 --> 13:05.440
I've been told that
I need to carry a firearm,

13:05.440 --> 13:08.200
so you'll need to book me in
at the range.

13:08.200 --> 13:09.600
Maybe tomorrow morning.

13:09.600 --> 13:12.520
And I doubt I'll get back
to the hotel very much.

13:12.520 --> 13:15.280
I'd like to find out where the
nearest pool is so I can swim.

13:17.800 --> 13:18.840
Good.

13:22.720 --> 13:25.800
I've been on to HQ.
We have a list of operational names.

13:27.280 --> 13:28.560
Eden.

13:28.560 --> 13:30.280
A place where the
woman gets the blame.

13:30.280 --> 13:32.240
Top Hat. Too posh.

13:32.240 --> 13:34.360
Alamo. Too Texan.

13:34.360 --> 13:35.640
Musicman.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.080
Too male.

13:37.080 --> 13:38.280
Genesis.

13:38.280 --> 13:41.200
My least favourite band.
Well, aside from U2.

13:41.200 --> 13:42.240
Hey, steady on...

13:42.240 --> 13:43.480
Ashdown.

13:43.480 --> 13:44.720
Too foresty.

13:44.720 --> 13:45.800
What?

13:45.800 --> 13:47.160
Reminds me of shallow graves.

13:49.080 --> 13:50.520
Seriousity, gentlemen.

14:09.760 --> 14:11.440
Good morning.

14:11.440 --> 14:12.520
ALL: Morning.

14:12.520 --> 14:15.760
First things first.
All telephones disconnected.

14:15.760 --> 14:19.520
All mobile phones switched to
a silent mode or switched off.

14:22.560 --> 14:24.880
Welcome to Operation Musicman.

14:27.560 --> 14:28.600
Hmm?

14:28.600 --> 14:29.640
Where are you?

14:29.640 --> 14:31.160
Yeah, I'm here. I'm in the car park.

14:31.160 --> 14:32.240
She's started.

14:32.240 --> 14:33.720
All right.

14:33.720 --> 14:37.360
As many of you will be aware,
we have come to the conclusion

14:37.360 --> 14:41.800
that the recent murders of Fiona
Gallagher, Alice Parker Monroe

14:41.800 --> 14:44.480
and Sarah Kay are linked...

14:45.560 --> 14:47.880
..and the work of a serial offender.

14:47.880 --> 14:51.680
Anyone in any doubt about the gender
of the person responsible?

14:54.720 --> 14:57.480
Then let's not waste our time
looking for a woman.

14:57.480 --> 15:01.240
I've asked my two deputies,
Garrett Brink and Jerry McElroy,

15:01.240 --> 15:02.960
to take responsibility
for allocating

15:02.960 --> 15:04.920
all the key roles within
the Task Force.

15:04.920 --> 15:07.480
They will also lead the debrief
on the Sarah Kay murder.

15:17.200 --> 15:20.600
When you hear the pathologist's
report, you will learn that

15:20.600 --> 15:24.720
Sarah Kay was six to seven weeks
pregnant at the time of her death.

15:47.560 --> 15:48.760
I think you got away with it.

15:48.760 --> 15:50.280
Good.

15:50.280 --> 15:53.160
Think of it as an addiction.

15:53.160 --> 15:56.320
There's a law of diminishing
returns.

15:56.320 --> 15:58.320
The serialist,
like the heroin addict,

15:58.320 --> 16:00.800
is always seeking
that elusive first high,

16:02.040 --> 16:03.440
and he's doomed to fail.

16:05.960 --> 16:09.040
That's why the cooling off periods
get shorter,

16:09.040 --> 16:12.360
and the crimes become
more elaborate.

16:15.040 --> 16:20.320
And he will carry on feeding
that killing habit...

16:22.040 --> 16:23.880
..unless we stop him.

16:29.840 --> 16:32.800
He clearly has a victim type.

16:32.800 --> 16:36.840
They are not victims of chance,
they are victims of choice.

16:36.840 --> 16:39.840
They don't know him,
but he knows them.

16:39.840 --> 16:44.040
It's possible that he's out there
stalking his next victim now.

16:44.040 --> 16:45.760
He may even have a waiting list.

16:47.600 --> 16:50.880
It seems that he breaks into
their homes a day or two

16:50.880 --> 16:52.760
before he then returns to kill them.

16:54.320 --> 16:56.800
How does he find
and select his victims?

16:58.640 --> 17:00.480
We need to be looking
at correspondences.

17:03.480 --> 17:05.520
What links these three women?

17:08.359 --> 17:11.640
We will be making an announcement
to the press later this afternoon.

17:11.640 --> 17:13.599
There's every possibility
after we do that,

17:13.599 --> 17:15.440
that we will be flooded with calls.

17:16.520 --> 17:21.000
But all of those calls need to be
captured, recorded and assessed.

17:23.040 --> 17:26.119
For there are many of us gathered
here today with still more to come.

17:26.119 --> 17:27.520
There is only one of him.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.360
You'd think that gives us
the advantage.

17:32.840 --> 17:33.880
But it doesn't.

17:35.480 --> 17:39.880
He moves around on his own,
in darkness.

17:41.760 --> 17:44.440
And we operate under the glare
of media lights.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.880
Now let's make sure that
we don't let anything

17:48.880 --> 17:50.880
slip through the cracks.

17:50.880 --> 17:53.960
The Devil, quite literally,
ladies and gentlemen...

17:55.240 --> 17:56.360
..is in the detail.

17:57.720 --> 18:01.120
Detail, detail and detail again.

18:08.840 --> 18:10.000
Can I help you?

18:13.960 --> 18:15.680
You!!

18:15.680 --> 18:16.920
Looking for someone?

18:20.960 --> 18:22.760
Are you talking to me?

18:22.760 --> 18:24.080
Yes, I'm taking to you.

18:25.560 --> 18:27.320
What are you doing here?

18:27.320 --> 18:28.840
How is that any
business of yours?

18:28.840 --> 18:30.640
I'm making it my business.

18:30.640 --> 18:31.920
You're not from around here.

18:33.120 --> 18:35.280
So? So what are you doing?

18:35.280 --> 18:37.360
There's a name tag
on the front seat.

18:37.360 --> 18:39.320
Hey, that stuff is private.

18:45.120 --> 18:47.240
I doubt James would be that
thrilled to know

18:47.240 --> 18:49.320
you're looking at his
family's case files.

18:49.320 --> 18:50.840
Jimmy?

18:50.840 --> 18:52.960
I'm a grief counsellor.

18:52.960 --> 18:54.200
He lost his son, Daniel.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.240
I know he did.

19:01.080 --> 19:02.280
You're on the wrong road.

19:03.720 --> 19:06.240
Yeah, I realise that now.

19:07.520 --> 19:09.920
Turn around and go back up there
and take the next right.

19:56.400 --> 19:57.600
For fuck's sake.

20:39.080 --> 20:40.120
Mr Spector?

20:41.120 --> 20:42.160
I was in the area.

20:43.800 --> 20:47.800
I was worried you missed a session
but, er, if this is a bad time?

20:47.800 --> 20:49.640
No. Come on in.

21:19.640 --> 21:21.520
VOICEMAIL: 'You have
one new message.'

21:21.520 --> 21:23.400
'Morning, Mummy. It's only me.'

21:24.400 --> 21:26.520
'I'm about to leave for school.'

21:26.520 --> 21:30.560
'I hope you're OK and all the babies
are OK, too. Love you. Bye!'

21:37.800 --> 21:41.520
When Daniel was small,
I was a registered childminder.

21:45.160 --> 21:46.960
They all used to play out there.

21:48.080 --> 21:49.840
Daniel, and the kids I looked after.

21:56.400 --> 21:59.960
When Jim went to prison
they revoked my licence.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.080
I've been into his room.

22:10.320 --> 22:11.360
Good.

22:12.640 --> 22:14.040
Would you like to see it?

22:18.440 --> 22:23.160
Stella, this is Martina Dean.
Martina is our Media Liaison
Officer.

22:23.160 --> 22:25.720
Before we start, I need a word
with you in private, sir.

22:38.960 --> 22:40.480
It's nothing special, is it?

22:49.640 --> 22:52.080
I don't think I'll ever be able
to accept what's happened.

22:56.720 --> 22:57.760
You don't have to.

22:58.800 --> 23:00.760
I don't subscribe to
that model of grief.

23:02.480 --> 23:06.440
I don't see bereavement as ever
being resolved or accepted.

23:08.680 --> 23:12.120
There is no closure, no recovery.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.280
But you can learn to live a life

23:15.280 --> 23:17.760
without the physical
presence of your son.

23:21.560 --> 23:22.680
That's just it.

23:26.320 --> 23:27.360
I can't.

23:32.040 --> 23:34.840
He would always come to me
for kisses and cuddles.

23:39.160 --> 23:40.800
He would always hold my hand.

23:45.360 --> 23:47.440
All I want is for somebody
to hold me.

23:50.320 --> 23:53.480
Tell me I'm going to be all right.
That I'm not going mad.

24:12.080 --> 24:13.120
Would you do that?

24:15.960 --> 24:17.560
What?

24:17.560 --> 24:18.600
Hold me?

24:25.560 --> 24:26.600
Yes.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.080
He came to my hotel room.

25:00.080 --> 25:01.520
When?

25:01.520 --> 25:02.520
Sunday night.

25:03.760 --> 25:04.840
Monday morning.

25:06.920 --> 25:07.960
Why?

25:17.240 --> 25:18.280
What time?

25:20.520 --> 25:22.120
Between 2.30 and 4.30am.

25:24.160 --> 25:26.520
About the same time that Sarah Kay
was being murdered.

25:29.520 --> 25:30.920
So he's on the hotel CCTV?

25:31.960 --> 25:33.120
Probably.

25:36.760 --> 25:39.280
Did you talk about his case?

25:39.280 --> 25:40.320
Or your review?

25:42.240 --> 25:43.280
No.

25:48.960 --> 25:50.840
James Olson was a married man,
Stella.

25:52.080 --> 25:54.440
Married, two kids.

25:55.520 --> 25:56.760
That's his business.

25:59.080 --> 26:00.840
He wasn't wearing a ring.

26:00.840 --> 26:04.200
I'm sure that'll be of some comfort
to his wife when she finds out

26:04.200 --> 26:07.160
that her husband spent his last
night on earth in your bed!

26:09.240 --> 26:10.560
You were a married man.

26:12.160 --> 26:13.920
When you spent a night in my bed.

26:21.200 --> 26:24.480
Am I going to regret my decision
to make you head of this Task Force?

26:26.040 --> 26:27.080
I hope not.

26:28.880 --> 26:31.080
Did you deliberately withhold
this information

26:31.080 --> 26:32.800
until after the debriefing?

26:32.800 --> 26:35.920
Yes. But I thought you should
know before the press conference.

26:38.480 --> 26:44.280
An SIO should display
high levels of personal integrity.

26:45.560 --> 26:50.760
Demonstrate professional,
ethical and moral standards!

26:50.760 --> 26:52.880
Show some self-control!

26:54.360 --> 26:55.760
I wasn't SIO at the time.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.760
Are you in the least bit upset
that Olson is dead?

27:08.240 --> 27:09.920
Shall we get Martina back in here?

27:25.640 --> 27:28.080
"I know where you live?"
"I know where you live?"

27:28.080 --> 27:29.240
You scumbag piece of shit!

27:29.240 --> 27:31.200
Did something happen
to your friend?

27:31.200 --> 27:33.720
Oh, I am sorry to hear about that.
Get off me!

27:33.720 --> 27:36.440
I'm a police officer, for God's
sake!

27:36.440 --> 27:37.960
Do wish him a speedy recovery.

27:40.760 --> 27:42.320
Get off me.

27:42.320 --> 27:45.920
If I find out you've been doing
their dirty work for them...

27:45.920 --> 27:48.880
Will you get off me! I'm a police
officer, for fuck's sake!

27:56.640 --> 27:59.680
We need to make it clear that Aaron
Monroe is of no interest to us.

28:02.080 --> 28:04.320
I don't see any
mention of Aaron Monroe.

28:04.320 --> 28:05.400
If it comes up.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.800
There's something
not right about him.

28:09.800 --> 28:10.840
That's as maybe.

28:11.920 --> 28:13.280
I need his father off my back.

28:14.600 --> 28:16.400
We should announce that
she was pregnant.

28:17.640 --> 28:21.000
It seems Sarah was on a course
in London seven weeks ago.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.760
Hopefully the father
will come forward.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.920
Can we not call them professional?

28:27.600 --> 28:29.240
What would you suggest?

28:29.240 --> 28:32.160
Something that's less
of a value judgment?

28:32.160 --> 28:33.560
Highly-qualified?

28:36.680 --> 28:40.040
And what about the washing
and the posing?

28:40.040 --> 28:41.280
The more detail we give out,

28:41.280 --> 28:43.320
the more likely there are
to be copycats.

28:43.320 --> 28:47.400
Also, in my experience, this kind of
case encourages false confessions,

28:47.400 --> 28:49.120
so we need to hold things back.

28:51.600 --> 28:52.680
The cutting of the hair?

28:53.720 --> 28:57.440
Yes, we should mention the hair
and the jewellery,

28:57.440 --> 28:59.160
but not the painting of the nails.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.360
Let's not refer to them
as innocent.

29:03.360 --> 29:04.560
They were innocent.

29:06.280 --> 29:08.560
What if he kills a prostitute next?

29:08.560 --> 29:12.040
Or a woman walking home drunk,
late at night in a short skirt?

29:13.440 --> 29:16.720
Will they be in some way less
innocent, therefore less deserving?

29:16.720 --> 29:17.760
Culpable?

29:19.040 --> 29:24.080
The media loves to divide women into
virgins and vamps, angels or whores.

29:26.080 --> 29:27.600
Let's not encourage them.

30:04.200 --> 30:06.000
OK.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.360
Erm, good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

30:08.360 --> 30:11.440
I am Assistant Chief Constable
Burns,

30:11.440 --> 30:14.080
and I would like to thank you all
for coming here today.

30:20.400 --> 30:21.960
CAR HORN BEEPS

30:30.640 --> 30:31.840
Hello!

30:35.240 --> 30:36.440
How are you, my darling?

30:36.440 --> 30:37.480
Exhausted.

30:41.200 --> 30:43.000
Where are the kittens? Come on!

30:44.280 --> 30:48.120
It is for these reasons we have
decided that the three murders

30:48.120 --> 30:53.880
are linked, and we are seeking one
individual for these crimes.

30:55.280 --> 30:58.520
I met with Sarah Kay's family today
and informed them

30:58.520 --> 31:00.400
of all the latest findings.

31:01.400 --> 31:05.600
I do, of course, offer them and
the families of Fiona Gallagher

31:05.600 --> 31:10.240
and Alice Parker Monroe
my heartfelt condolences.

31:11.600 --> 31:16.040
The members of my team are working
tirelessly to provide them

31:16.040 --> 31:18.000
with the answers that they require.

31:19.240 --> 31:23.120
Why were these women killed
and who is responsible?

31:24.520 --> 31:28.040
They're so lovely.
Have they got names?

31:28.040 --> 31:31.160
Not yet. Can I pick one up?
If you're gentle.

31:33.720 --> 31:35.960
Hey, Daddy.

31:38.080 --> 31:40.320
John. Did I see a new
quad bike outside?

31:40.320 --> 31:41.440
You did.

31:43.160 --> 31:44.800
Do you want to go on the quad bike?
OK.

31:47.200 --> 31:48.280
Hey, take Olivia.

31:48.280 --> 31:49.720
She's playing with the kittens.

31:49.720 --> 31:53.480
Yeah, but she's the eldest. You've
got to put her first sometimes.

31:59.040 --> 32:02.680
Mary Otwin, BBC News.
Who discovered the body?

32:02.680 --> 32:04.360
Her sister, Marion.

32:04.360 --> 32:07.160
Were there any signs
of a sexual assault?

32:07.160 --> 32:08.320
Er, that's not something

32:08.320 --> 32:10.880
I would like to disclose at this
stage of the investigation.

32:10.880 --> 32:12.640
Alison O'Brien, TVNI.

32:12.640 --> 32:14.520
Were the three victims
known to each other?

32:14.520 --> 32:17.680
That is a line of enquiry that we
are actively pursuing.

32:17.680 --> 32:20.720
Was Sarah Kay clothed
when she was found?

32:20.720 --> 32:22.040
No, she was unclothed.

32:23.520 --> 32:24.920
Ned Callan, Belfast Chronicle.

32:24.920 --> 32:27.240
Has the review that you were
conducting into the death

32:27.240 --> 32:28.840
of Alice Monroe been suspended?

32:28.840 --> 32:29.960
Yes, it has.

32:29.960 --> 32:32.160
Were you the first person
to link the three murders?

32:32.160 --> 32:33.920
I did discern a link
between the murders,

32:33.920 --> 32:38.000
and then discussed them internally
with other PSNI officers.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.880
Were the independent murder
enquiries conducted into the deaths

32:40.880 --> 32:43.520
of Fiona Gallagher and Alice Monroe
adequate, in your view?

32:44.800 --> 32:48.520
I think there is no doubt that the
best way to advance the enquiries

32:48.520 --> 32:52.600
into these three tragic murders
is to view them as related

32:52.600 --> 32:54.400
and to proceed accordingly.

32:54.400 --> 32:58.160
Can you explain why neighbours
report seeing a police patrol car

32:58.160 --> 33:00.880
outside the most recent victim's
house on the Friday evening

33:00.880 --> 33:02.560
before the murder took place...

33:02.560 --> 33:04.480
Mr Callan, we've only got
a few minutes left

33:04.480 --> 33:07.800
and there are a lot of
other hands raised, so...

33:08.920 --> 33:10.360
Fucking hell!

33:14.280 --> 33:17.480
Well done for spotting
the wardrobe malfunction.

33:17.480 --> 33:18.800
Cleavage? Just chest.

34:13.480 --> 34:15.719
Daddy, I want to go back.

34:18.199 --> 34:19.719
Wait a minute.

34:27.760 --> 34:29.280
I don't want to go in there.

34:30.480 --> 34:32.080
Wait a second, OK?
wait for Daddy.

34:48.639 --> 34:50.040
Daddy!

35:01.040 --> 35:03.800
Daddy! I need a wee!

35:15.720 --> 35:17.920
I'm going to tell Mummy!

35:28.040 --> 35:29.960
I'm freezing, Daddy!

35:35.760 --> 35:37.080
Daddy!

36:12.480 --> 36:15.400
Mum suggests we stay a day or two.

36:15.400 --> 36:18.840
I can't. I've got some work
to do before tomorrow.

36:21.920 --> 36:23.360
We could stay, I guess.

36:24.600 --> 36:27.680
Dad could run the kids to school
in the morning, drop me off.

36:34.080 --> 36:37.040
Mum's offered Olivia
one of the kittens.

36:37.040 --> 36:39.000
What a surprise(!)

36:39.000 --> 36:40.920
Can she have one?

36:40.920 --> 36:44.240
Kittens turn into cats.
Cats kill the birds.

36:44.240 --> 36:46.440
We could put it in a collar.
With a bell.

38:10.200 --> 38:13.120
'..decided that the
three murders are linked,

38:14.320 --> 38:19.920
'and we are actively seeking one
individual for these crimes.'

38:19.920 --> 38:23.000
'That was Detective Superintendent
Gibson speaking

38:23.000 --> 38:25.360
'at a press conference
earlier today.'

38:25.360 --> 38:28.280
'The three murder victims,
Fiona Gallagher, Alison Monroe

38:28.280 --> 38:30.680
'and Sarah Kay, were all
professional women

38:30.680 --> 38:34.400
'in their early thirties, killed by
strangulation in their own homes.

38:34.400 --> 38:37.120
'Superintendent Gibson
made this appeal.'

38:37.120 --> 38:42.560
'I would ask that anyone out there
today, who has any information

38:42.560 --> 38:47.400
'whatsoever, to please step forward
and speak to us.

38:47.400 --> 38:51.320
'They can call on the Operation
Musicman incident phone...'

39:09.920 --> 39:13.640
Aaaaah! Mummy!

39:26.120 --> 39:28.560
Mummy!

39:28.560 --> 39:30.840
You didn't tell me
this was still happening.

40:01.280 --> 40:03.680
Sssh. It's OK.

40:06.720 --> 40:09.120
She shouldn't have that
necklace on in bed, should she?

40:09.120 --> 40:10.160
Why?

40:10.160 --> 40:11.480
She could strangle herself.

40:13.240 --> 40:17.000
Here, take a wee drink, sweetheart.
There you go. That's it.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.440
Where did she get it?

40:18.440 --> 40:20.680
Paul gave it to her. Why do you ask?

40:20.680 --> 40:23.760
Oh, just looks like an odd choice
for a little girl.

40:23.760 --> 40:25.600
She loves it.

40:25.600 --> 40:29.400
There, OK, that's it.

40:29.400 --> 40:31.440
Sssh, good girl.

40:32.520 --> 40:34.000
Good girl.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.920
What do you think you
dreamt about this time?

42:06.920 --> 42:08.920
It's not a dream.

42:08.920 --> 42:11.800
Well, what do you think you saw
that upset you?

42:11.800 --> 42:15.240
A lady. What lady?

42:15.240 --> 42:17.560
A lady with no clothes on.

42:17.560 --> 42:19.280
There is no lady, darling.

42:21.040 --> 42:22.440
There is at home.

42:24.800 --> 42:25.840
What?

42:27.440 --> 42:29.280
I've seen a lady at home.

42:30.600 --> 42:32.040
Where?

42:32.040 --> 42:33.520
Upstairs.

42:34.640 --> 42:35.760
Where upstairs?

42:37.360 --> 42:39.280
Upstairs in the ceiling.

42:40.440 --> 42:41.480
What do you mean?

42:43.720 --> 42:45.640
Above my bedroom.

42:47.400 --> 42:48.440
It's OK.

43:10.280 --> 43:13.200
RADIO: 'Police this evening have
revealed that murdered solicitor

43:13.200 --> 43:16.320
'Sarah Kay was pregnant
at the time of her death.

43:16.320 --> 43:18.280
'Family members believe
it is possible

43:18.280 --> 43:21.280
'Sarah was herself unaware
of her pregnancy.

43:21.280 --> 43:24.400
'Police have appealed to anyone
involved in an intimate relationship

43:24.400 --> 43:27.120
'with her in the last two months

43:27.120 --> 43:29.600
'to help the police
with their enquiries.

43:29.600 --> 43:31.400
'Detective Superintendent Gibson,

43:31.400 --> 43:34.280
'who is leading the investigation
into the murder of Sarah Kay,

'which was today linked to two other
recent murders in Belfast,

'refused to comment on whether
the killer, if caught,

43:40.440 --> 43:43.000
'would face charges of
child destruction.'

45:06.920 --> 45:09.280
KNOCK AT DOOR

45:09.280 --> 45:11.640
I know you're in there.
Open the door!

45:14.920 --> 45:16.960
Open the door,
or I'll fucking kick it in!

45:19.560 --> 45:20.680
I know you're in there!

45:30.200 --> 45:31.560
Jimmy, what are you doing here?

45:32.840 --> 45:34.560
Who the hell do
you think you are?

45:34.560 --> 45:37.880
Telling people on my street
that I'm in fucking therapy?

45:37.880 --> 45:42.120
Calling to my house when I'm not
there? Sniffing round my wife?

45:42.120 --> 45:44.200
I didn't say anything
to anyone about therapy.

45:44.200 --> 45:46.520
Then how come the whole
fucking world knows?

45:46.520 --> 45:47.880
Not from me.

45:47.880 --> 45:49.000
Bullshit.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.680
You had your Jewboy ID hanging
off your fucking neck.

45:51.680 --> 45:54.200
Liz needs help,
Jimmy, can you not see that?

45:54.200 --> 45:55.600
Not from you, she doesn't.

45:56.960 --> 45:58.120
I saw the bruises, Jimmy.

46:04.400 --> 46:06.000
You stay away from my wife.

46:09.080 --> 46:11.120
Or I'll fucking kill you.

46:11.120 --> 46:12.320
And your wife.

46:13.560 --> 46:14.680
And your kids.

46:42.760 --> 46:43.800
Stella?

46:45.080 --> 46:49.520
I wondered if you had the test
screen results on Sarah Kay?

46:49.520 --> 46:50.600
I sent them through.

46:52.640 --> 46:55.680
Did you do the autopsy
on James Olson?

46:55.680 --> 46:58.360
Yes, I did.
I've just been talking to his wife.

46:58.360 --> 47:00.280
Actually, do you have a minute?

47:00.280 --> 47:02.200
There's something that might
interest you.

47:02.200 --> 47:03.240
Yeah.

47:12.760 --> 47:14.560
Ever seen anything like this?

47:16.000 --> 47:17.720
Jesus.

47:17.720 --> 47:20.920
Seven spent bullets in his body,
three in his head.

48:28.920 --> 48:30.240
How's it going, Jerry?

48:30.240 --> 48:32.640
We're swamped with phone calls,
as you predicted.

48:32.640 --> 48:35.240
Women turning in their boyfriends,
brothers, sons.

48:36.920 --> 48:39.760
It is a husband, boyfriend,
brother or a son we're looking for.

48:39.760 --> 48:40.840
Yes, ma'am.

48:44.360 --> 48:46.600
The press got hold of those
photographs of Sarah Kay.

48:50.080 --> 48:52.080
DCI Eastwood's in your office,
ma'am.

49:02.160 --> 49:05.080
I've spoken with
Assistant Chief Constable Burns.

49:06.280 --> 49:09.320
He tells me that Detective Sergeant
Olson visited you

49:09.320 --> 49:11.720
in your hotel room in the early
hours of Monday morning?

49:11.720 --> 49:13.280
That's correct.

49:13.280 --> 49:15.040
Can you tell me
the purpose of that visit?

49:16.560 --> 49:17.960
Sexual intercourse.

49:22.240 --> 49:24.600
How long was
DS Olson with you?

49:24.600 --> 49:26.960
Two, two and a half hours.

49:26.960 --> 49:30.720
Did you converse at all?

49:30.720 --> 49:31.920
Very little.

49:33.160 --> 49:35.680
What was his state of mind,
would you say?

49:35.680 --> 49:37.360
He seemed fine.

49:37.360 --> 49:39.640
Not preoccupied, worried? No.

49:43.600 --> 49:47.080
We retrieved two phones
from Sergeant Olson's body.

49:47.080 --> 49:50.120
One a contract phone, the other
an unregistered pay-as-you-go.

49:51.640 --> 49:53.840
Does your number feature
on that list?

49:55.960 --> 49:57.120
Yes.

49:57.120 --> 49:58.360
Mark the calls for me.

50:25.400 --> 50:26.920
Two of these are media messages.

50:28.040 --> 50:30.760
Can you tell me what he sent you?
I didn't open them.

50:30.760 --> 50:32.160
Why?

50:32.160 --> 50:33.200
I didn't want to.

50:34.280 --> 50:35.880
Because he was a married man?

50:35.880 --> 50:37.200
I didn't know that at the time.

50:37.200 --> 50:38.400
But you didn't think to ask?

50:38.400 --> 50:39.920
He didn't think to tell me.

50:43.160 --> 50:45.800
I know nothing that will help you
with your enquiry,

50:45.800 --> 50:48.200
and I have a lot work to do.

50:59.840 --> 51:02.120
When did you first meet
Sergeant Olson?

51:03.320 --> 51:05.280
That's what really bothers you,
isn't it?

51:06.880 --> 51:08.200
The one night stand.

51:09.640 --> 51:11.400
Man fucks woman.

51:11.400 --> 51:15.600
Subject man, verb fucks,
object woman. That's OK.

51:17.080 --> 51:18.240
Woman fucks man.

51:19.600 --> 51:22.920
Woman subject, man object.

51:24.200 --> 51:25.960
That's not so comfortable for you,
is it?

51:51.160 --> 51:53.280
OK, here's where
I'm at with this guy.

51:54.840 --> 51:57.240
There's an athleticism
to these crimes

51:57.240 --> 51:59.720
that suggests that he's a young man.

52:01.600 --> 52:06.480
Sarah Kay was 65 inches tall
and weighed 112 pounds.

52:06.480 --> 52:07.880
The same as a sack of cement

52:07.880 --> 52:10.240
and he's picking her up
and moving her around.

52:10.240 --> 52:12.400
With no signs on the heels
of dragging.

52:12.400 --> 52:14.520
So he's lifting her. He's strong.

52:16.160 --> 52:19.160
Fiona Gallagher may have
been his first kill,

52:19.160 --> 52:21.440
but I doubt she was
his first attack.

52:23.040 --> 52:24.960
There's a progression.

52:24.960 --> 52:29.840
An increased level of criminal
sophistication that suggests

52:29.840 --> 52:34.720
that he understands police work
and he knows criminology.

52:36.360 --> 52:40.600
As such, I would put his age
at mid-20s to mid-30s.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.360
And he's intelligent.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
Even highly intelligent.

52:48.000 --> 52:49.840
Well, that will go with
the psychological

52:49.840 --> 52:51.840
rather than the physical torture.

52:52.880 --> 52:55.440
Maybe lower-paid white collar.

52:55.440 --> 52:56.760
Quasi-professional.

52:57.920 --> 53:00.520
Less qualified than these women.

53:00.520 --> 53:05.000
Perhaps he's an underachiever,
or at least in his own eyes,

53:05.000 --> 53:08.640
and he selects victims that
he feels inferior to

53:08.640 --> 53:11.840
and then dominates
and humiliates them.

53:11.840 --> 53:14.560
So he hates women
who occupy powerful positions?

53:14.560 --> 53:15.600
Don't we all?

53:24.400 --> 53:26.520
So why the washing?

53:26.520 --> 53:28.520
He likes a clean scene.

53:28.520 --> 53:31.000
Victims of strangulation
mess themselves.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.080
But the washing is more
than that, isn't it?

53:34.280 --> 53:37.040
It's more than cleaning up,
more than destroying evidence.

53:47.720 --> 53:49.600
He needs them clean for the posing.

53:50.960 --> 53:52.360
Does he wash them in the bath?

53:53.480 --> 53:54.880
Does he get in with them?

53:56.120 --> 53:57.520
Bathe with them? Maybe.

53:58.560 --> 53:59.800
Cleans himself, too.

54:00.920 --> 54:03.520
Are you thinking there's
a religious dimension?

54:03.520 --> 54:06.360
What do you mean?
Purifying.

54:06.360 --> 54:09.120
Washing away their sins, his sins,
I don't know.

54:15.160 --> 54:18.320
What kind of sexual release
is he getting at the scene?

54:18.320 --> 54:19.560
Well, masturbate, I guess.

54:20.840 --> 54:23.640
There's no ejaculate at the scene.

54:23.640 --> 54:25.400
Into a condom?

54:25.400 --> 54:27.680
There's no sign of damage,
anal or vaginal.

54:27.680 --> 54:31.360
Well, he could be having post-mortem
intercourse that's not violent.

54:31.360 --> 54:35.120
For me, the sexual release
comes afterwards.

54:36.600 --> 54:37.920
When he's on his own.

54:40.080 --> 54:41.840
It's all part of the fantasy.

54:41.840 --> 54:44.920
The fantasy that sustains him
between killings.

54:54.000 --> 54:55.960
It's about power, and control.

54:57.520 --> 54:58.920
And the thrill.

55:01.560 --> 55:03.400
It thrills him to stalk these women.

55:07.640 --> 55:11.960
To break into their houses,
to take their underwear.

55:27.040 --> 55:28.280
It's about intimacy.

55:33.360 --> 55:35.040
What could be more intimate than...

55:36.520 --> 55:39.000
..squeezing the life
from another human being?

55:43.560 --> 55:45.880
Having their dead body
at your disposal.

56:03.760 --> 56:06.320
We've all seen more degrading
crime scenes.

56:08.480 --> 56:10.880
Bodies with objects left
inside them.

56:13.800 --> 56:15.000
This is different.

56:25.000 --> 56:26.560
It's like an art form to him.

56:43.040 --> 56:44.880
I'm certain he takes photographs.

56:48.280 --> 56:49.400
After they're dead.

56:51.600 --> 56:53.160
They're playthings to him.

56:54.920 --> 56:57.880
He treats them like objects.
He paints their nails.

57:01.400 --> 57:02.800
He uses them like dolls.

57:32.400 --> 57:33.960
He's creating his own pornography.
