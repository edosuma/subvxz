Always remember
your promise to me.

01:51.276 --> 01:54.439
Never let nobody or nothing
turn you into no cripple.

02:16.335 --> 02:17.461
All right!

02:17.536 --> 02:19.094
Rest stop, 45 minutes.

02:19.238 --> 02:21.468
Come on, folks.
We gotta move.

02:21.740 --> 02:24.800
We leave at 2:45 p. M.
On the dot. Can't be late.

02:25.811 --> 02:28.041
Hot meals
and bathrooms inside.

02:28.881 --> 02:30.872
All right, uh, there's a
window out back

02:30.949 --> 02:32.314
for y'all to buy sandwiches.

02:32.384 --> 02:34.909
And I suggest you make
good use of them outhouses.

02:34.987 --> 02:37.387
Ain't nothing but bushes
for you in the Carolinas.

02:37.456 --> 02:38.718
Sir.

02:41.226 --> 02:42.693
Can I help you, sir?

02:42.761 --> 02:43.853
Yes, sir.

02:45.164 --> 02:46.392
Seattle?

02:47.766 --> 02:49.028
Who you riding with?

02:49.101 --> 02:50.693
Nobody. Just me.

02:50.836 --> 02:53.361
Boy, I can't take
responsibility

02:53.438 --> 02:56.305
for some blind nigger
traveling 3,500 miles alone.

02:56.375 --> 02:58.570
I... I... I paid for this here
ticket, and it says

02:58.644 --> 03:00.669
that you have to take me
to Seattle.

03:00.846 --> 03:03.371
Don't you be smarting off
to me, boy.

03:04.249 --> 03:06.513
With all due respect, sir,
I earned the right.

03:06.585 --> 03:08.485
I may have left my eyes
on Omaha Beach,

03:08.554 --> 03:10.647
but I ain't asking no charity
from Uncle Sam.

03:10.722 --> 03:12.986
I got a job waiting
for me in Seattle.

03:14.426 --> 03:15.654
You were in Normandy?

03:15.727 --> 03:18.025
Shuttling troopers
to the beach.

03:18.497 --> 03:20.294
We took a direct hit.

03:25.404 --> 03:26.769
I'm sorry, son.

03:28.540 --> 03:30.599
I'll keep an eye on you
myself.

03:30.676 --> 03:33.008
Come on.
Take a seat in the back.

03:40.419 --> 03:43.217
<i># Any time #</i>

03:43.455 --> 03:47.255

Til, what the hell
do you think you're doin'?

04:19.423 --> 04:21.415
Billy, don't get
your feathers all ruffled now.

04:21.493 --> 04:24.223
I met this ol' boy over
at the O.C. At Clarkfield,

04:24.296 --> 04:25.888
and well, he plays
a mean jazz piano.

04:25.964 --> 04:28.262
<i>I don't care if he whistles
Dixie out his ass.</i>

04:28.333 --> 04:30.301
He ain't gonna
do it here.

04:30.369 --> 04:31.700
Sir.

04:31.937 --> 04:33.700
Boy, are you blind?

04:33.772 --> 04:35.399
Yes, sir.
Since I was seven.

04:37.175 --> 04:38.870
Well, let me help you
out then.

04:38.944 --> 04:41.071
This is a country band.

04:41.213 --> 04:43.443
We don't play
no boogie-woogie.

04:43.715 --> 04:46.081
Uh, yes, I understand.
I love country music.

04:46.151 --> 04:48.676
All right, go on.
Tell me.

04:48.754 --> 04:51.222
What is it you love
about country music?

04:51.290 --> 04:52.587
I... I love the stories.

04:52.658 --> 04:54.216
Uh, you know,
about fallin' in love

04:54.293 --> 04:55.954
and having love
knock you around

04:56.028 --> 04:58.019
and then the pressures
of the world on you so tough.

04:58.096 --> 04:59.324
It... It makes you
feel small.

04:59.398 --> 05:00.831
You want to give
your soul to God.

05:00.899 --> 05:02.867
You might as well.
Your ass belongs to Him.

05:11.977 --> 05:13.444
Boy, are you sure
you blind?

05:13.512 --> 05:14.911
Last time I checked.

05:27.993 --> 05:29.460
Okay. Come on in.

05:43.608 --> 05:46.042
Billy,
I think you're outvoted.

05:46.378 --> 05:48.505
Til, one hint of trouble,

05:48.580 --> 05:50.377
and your blind nigra's
out of here.

05:52.250 --> 05:53.342
Damn!

05:53.985 --> 05:55.077
Here.

05:55.220 --> 05:57.711
I'm gonna have
to put some glasses

05:57.789 --> 06:00.417
before he scares
somebody half to death.

06:10.202 --> 06:11.965
Seattle, Washington, folks.

06:12.037 --> 06:14.028
Change bus here
for all points north:

06:14.106 --> 06:15.733
Bellingham, Mount Vernon.

06:15.807 --> 06:17.468
Vancouver, Canada.

06:36.094 --> 06:38.358
<i>Uh, that's Diz. Emanon.</i>

06:39.297 --> 06:41.197
Yeah. But what's it
spell backwards?

06:41.266 --> 06:42.528
Ah... ah... ah, come on, man.

06:42.601 --> 06:44.831
Why don't you give me
something difficult?

06:44.903 --> 06:46.165
"No Name."

06:47.639 --> 06:49.732
Say, daddy-o,
what ax you play?

06:49.808 --> 06:50.775
Uh, piano.

06:50.842 --> 06:52.207
Just blew in
from Tampa, Florida.

06:52.277 --> 06:54.142
Me and my partner,
Gossie McGee, came here,

06:54.212 --> 06:55.839
you know, want to
fatten up our style.

06:55.914 --> 06:58.212
Cop some licks from some more
experienced cats. You dig?

06:58.283 --> 06:59.477
You know what?

06:59.551 --> 07:01.143
Why don't you let me
take you inside?

07:01.219 --> 07:02.345
You know,
show you around.

07:02.421 --> 07:03.979
All right.
Perfect gentleman.
Yeah.

07:04.055 --> 07:05.522
This is just
like my place.

07:05.590 --> 07:06.784
So, what's your name?

07:06.858 --> 07:07.916
Ray Robinson.

07:07.993 --> 07:09.051
I'm Quincy Jones.

07:09.127 --> 07:10.116
Quincy Jones.

07:10.195 --> 07:12.493
Hey, Gerry!
This here's my man, Ray.

07:12.564 --> 07:14.327
He's here to see his friend,
Gossie McGee.

07:14.399 --> 07:15.889
So I figured
I'll show him inside...

07:15.967 --> 07:18.162
Don't mess with me, Q.
He can come in, but not you.

07:18.236 --> 07:20.670
Vice is on my ass for letting
you underage kids in.

07:20.739 --> 07:21.899
Get out of here, Q.

07:21.973 --> 07:23.440
Can't you see...
Get out of here, Q.

07:23.508 --> 07:25.305
He's blind!
I gotta show him in.
Get out.

07:25.377 --> 07:27.174
Jive-ass.
What?

07:27.245 --> 07:29.975
Hey, Ray Robinson,
when am I gonna
hear you play, baby?

07:30.048 --> 07:31.675
Uh, well,
that may cost you.

07:32.417 --> 07:37.218
Welcome, all you cool cats
and fine felines.

07:37.289 --> 07:40.224
You've come to the place
where the sophisti-cats
and hipsters

07:40.292 --> 07:42.157
hang their bebop hats.

07:42.327 --> 07:44.522
So snuggle up
and come near

07:44.596 --> 07:48.157
for tonight is Talent Night
at The Rocking Chair.

07:48.600 --> 07:51.626
Let's hear it
for Dancin' Al!

08:01.246 --> 08:04.579
Gossie's been cattin' around
with one of my waitresses
since he got here.

08:04.649 --> 08:07.777
He never told me
that his partner
was a blind 'Bama boy.

08:07.986 --> 08:10.284
Marlene,
Demurs just called.

08:10.355 --> 08:12.255
Thurmond's sick.

08:12.491 --> 08:13.753
What about Sassy?

08:13.825 --> 08:15.019
Flat tire.

08:22.534 --> 08:26.061
Okay, 'Bama.
Why don't you get on up there
and show me what you got?

08:26.204 --> 08:29.139
Well, I-I'm not
prepared to do my thing
right now, tonight...

08:29.207 --> 08:31.368
This is the only audition
you're going to get, puddin'.

08:31.443 --> 08:35.004
So either get on up there,
or you and Gossie can haul
your asses back down South.

08:35.080 --> 08:37.014
Here. Smoke some of this.

08:40.919 --> 08:42.580
This ain't no tobacco, man.

08:42.654 --> 08:44.519
No, hold it in,
it'll calm you down.

08:44.589 --> 08:45.954
All right, Oberon.

08:46.024 --> 08:47.491
Get on up there
and introduce him.

08:47.559 --> 08:48.958
Yes, ma'am.

08:49.394 --> 08:51.794
Okay, 'Bama. Let's go.

08:53.131 --> 08:54.325
Yeah.

08:56.902 --> 09:01.202
Now, I got something special
for all you satin dolls.

09:01.306 --> 09:04.002
And I don't mean
Oberon's big thunder.

09:05.210 --> 09:06.905
Now that's
for another show.

09:06.978 --> 09:09.208
Now we got some
new blood for ya.

09:09.281 --> 09:11.408
Yeah, straight off
the bus from Florida,

09:11.483 --> 09:16.318
I give you Ray
"Don't Call Me Sugar"
Robinson!

09:25.730 --> 09:27.027
How y'all doing tonight?

09:27.098 --> 09:28.326
Better than you!

09:31.336 --> 09:32.564
Relax, Ray. Relax.

09:32.637 --> 09:33.797
I got it.

09:38.276 --> 09:39.641
Uh-uh, what do y'all
want to hear?

09:43.648 --> 09:45.548
<i>How about
a little Nat King Cole?</i>

09:52.057 --> 09:53.957
Y'all like Nat King Cole?

09:56.995 --> 10:01.261
# If you ever plan
to travel west #

10:02.934 --> 10:04.196
'Bama ain't bad.

10:04.269 --> 10:06.032
Yeah, I'd say
he saved our asses.

10:08.506 --> 10:10.337
What the hell is
Ray doin' up there?

10:10.475 --> 10:12.306
Auditioning for you,
Gossie.

10:12.911 --> 10:14.845
He ain't no good without me.

10:15.880 --> 10:18.815
How'd you and the 'Bama
like to do a week
here at the Chair?

10:18.883 --> 10:20.282
I know a good bass player.

10:20.352 --> 10:23.651
A nice jazz trio could score
big with the right manager.

10:24.522 --> 10:25.716
Manager?

10:26.391 --> 10:28.450
Come on now, Gossie,
don't be so small-minded.

10:28.526 --> 10:30.084
You know
you've got to give to get.

10:30.161 --> 10:32.152
Now what exactly do I
have to give?

10:32.230 --> 10:33.595
25 percent.

10:33.665 --> 10:35.189
But I'll be gettin' you
other gigs.

10:35.266 --> 10:38.167
All right,
next question: What do I get?

10:38.870 --> 10:40.201
What do you need?

10:40.271 --> 10:43.172
Double scale as leader,
plus 10 percent.

10:44.542 --> 10:45.839
What about the 'Bama?

10:45.910 --> 10:48.401
He's about as green
as a blade of grass.

10:49.247 --> 10:50.509
I can handle him.

10:50.582 --> 10:52.209
# Flagstaff, Arizona #

10:52.751 --> 10:53.911
Yeah, he's green.

10:53.985 --> 10:55.452
# Kingman, Barstow #

10:55.520 --> 10:57.283
So, Gossie,
you don't need to worry

10:57.355 --> 10:58.879
about a hotel room
for the 'Bama.

10:59.190 --> 11:00.953
He can flop at my place.

11:01.993 --> 11:03.620
Hey, y'all never change.

11:03.695 --> 11:07.688
# Get your kicks
on Route sixty-six ##

11:10.935 --> 11:13.199
Ray, you coming back to bed?

11:14.739 --> 11:16.138
I'm getting some water.

11:16.207 --> 11:19.108
I can see that,
but mama ain't finished yet.

11:19.744 --> 11:21.541
<i>For the first time anywhere,</i>

11:21.613 --> 11:24.582
<i>let's hear it
for The McSon Trio!</i>

11:24.649 --> 11:27.277
# A buzzard took the monkey
for a ride in the air #

11:27.352 --> 11:30.446
# The monkey thought that
everything was on the square #

11:30.522 --> 11:31.989
Ray, when you
coming out?

11:32.057 --> 11:33.319
In a minute.

11:33.858 --> 11:37.259
Mama's got some more
blackberry cobbler
for you, baby.

11:37.896 --> 11:39.022
Damn.

11:40.765 --> 11:43.131
# Straighten up
and fly right #

11:43.201 --> 11:45.726
# Cool down, papa,
don't you blow your top ##

11:54.813 --> 11:56.872
Marlene, if you're gonna
send us out on tour,

11:56.948 --> 11:58.540
we're gonna need
more than $5 a day.

11:58.616 --> 12:00.675
How come we can't get paid
after each gig?

12:00.752 --> 12:02.913
Because you boys will spend
everything you make.

12:02.987 --> 12:05.888
The club sends the checks
to me, so as I can bank them.

12:05.957 --> 12:08.357
I just want to see
my own checks, that's all.

12:08.426 --> 12:11.293
You don't see, Ray.
You're blind, baby.

12:11.362 --> 12:13.057
Or did you forget?

12:13.698 --> 12:17.156
Now, you want to go out
on your own
and see how well you do?

12:25.210 --> 12:27.940
Ray! Hey, Marlene,
where's Ray?

12:28.012 --> 12:30.947
He's in the back bedroom.
And wipe your feet.

12:36.621 --> 12:40.614
Ray, uh, six-nine,
where you at?
Six-nine. Six-nine.

12:41.893 --> 12:44.293
Lionel Hampton just asked me
to go on the road
with him, man!

12:44.362 --> 12:45.920
Lionel Hampton, man!

12:45.997 --> 12:47.828
Sure he did.
Then why you still here?

12:47.899 --> 12:51.858
And dig this:
His wife, she kicked me off
the tour bus.

12:51.936 --> 12:54.769
Told me to come back
when I started shaving.
You believe that?

12:54.839 --> 12:57.967
Uh... uh, Seven-oh, could you
do me a favor, man,
and close that bag for me?

12:58.042 --> 13:00.374
What's wrong?
You got two hands.
You can close it yourself.

13:00.445 --> 13:02.208
I got two feet, too.
Could you close it?

13:02.280 --> 13:03.872
I got it.

13:05.850 --> 13:07.477
Excuse me, sir!

13:08.920 --> 13:11.081
Man, we're gonna be late.

13:11.523 --> 13:13.855
I got to get
my own place, Gossie.

13:14.492 --> 13:17.825
Why? I mean,
you got free rent right now.

13:18.029 --> 13:19.997
Like hell it's free rent.

13:24.135 --> 13:25.363
Oh, come on, Ray.

13:25.436 --> 13:27.336
Why you gonna mess
with a good thing?

13:27.405 --> 13:29.703
All I'm saying is you keep
layin' that pipe with Marlene,

13:29.774 --> 13:31.708
and I bet you she's gonna
make us all rich.

13:31.776 --> 13:33.607
Hey, sir, excuse me!

13:40.185 --> 13:41.709
# Straighten up

<i>same time, same place,
next week.</i>

14:14.285 --> 14:18.051
Hey, baby, you sound
more like Nat
than the King himself.

14:19.924 --> 14:21.016
What's your name?

14:21.092 --> 14:22.116
Ray Robinson.

14:22.327 --> 14:23.487
Ray Robinson?

14:23.561 --> 14:26.086
I'm Jack Lauderdale,
Swing Time Records.

14:26.164 --> 14:29.099
Oh, hey... hey, hey, Jack!
How you doing, man?

14:29.167 --> 14:30.361
Good.
Oh, good.

14:30.435 --> 14:32.062
How about us makin'
a record together?

14:32.136 --> 14:34.195
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Hell, yeah! Let's do that.

14:34.272 --> 14:35.466
Can I help you?

14:35.540 --> 14:36.564
I don't think so.

14:36.641 --> 14:38.939
We're just talking
a little business.

14:39.010 --> 14:42.173
Then you need to talk to me,
'cause I'm his manager.

14:42.580 --> 14:43.979
Whichever way
the wind blows.

14:44.048 --> 14:45.174
It's blowing.

14:45.250 --> 14:46.808
Jack Lauderdale,
Swing Time Records.

14:46.885 --> 14:48.750
Marlene Andres.
Marlene?

14:48.820 --> 14:50.310
Gossie McGee.
Gossie McGee.

14:50.388 --> 14:51.582
Great set, baby.

14:51.656 --> 14:53.624
We're going to talk
with Mr. Lauderdale here.

14:53.691 --> 14:55.022
Come on, Jack.
I'm buying.

14:55.093 --> 14:56.526
I'm coming in, uh,
to talk to him.

14:56.594 --> 14:58.653
You are doing
a fabulous job!

14:58.730 --> 14:59.754
Yes, man.

14:59.831 --> 15:01.822
Eh, look, let's talk to him
about this record.

15:01.900 --> 15:03.993
Hey, no, no, we're gonna
let Marlene handle that.

15:04.068 --> 15:06.002
You get Oberon
to call you a cab, all right.

15:06.070 --> 15:07.628
Great set, Ray.

15:08.740 --> 15:09.934
Goss!

15:10.008 --> 15:12.101
Hey, daddy-o, want a smoke?

15:12.677 --> 15:14.645
I got some gage,
fresh off the boat.

15:14.712 --> 15:16.179
It's clean and seedless.

15:16.247 --> 15:18.010
So that's how it is, huh?

15:18.216 --> 15:21.014
You keep me high
while they talk the business?

15:21.486 --> 15:23.818
I ain't the one
playing you, man.

15:24.422 --> 15:25.821
Oberon, listen...

15:27.592 --> 15:30.959
You know, Marlene and Gossie
are the ones running
the game on you, Ray.

15:31.029 --> 15:32.087
What?

15:32.163 --> 15:34.688
They sliced up the pie
the first night you played.

15:34.766 --> 15:36.495
35 percent off the top.

15:36.567 --> 15:38.592
Plus Gossie's
double scale as leader.

15:39.037 --> 15:40.299
Leader?
If anybody's leading the band,

15:40.371 --> 15:42.566
I'm the one
that's the leader.

15:42.874 --> 15:44.398
Forget the bo' humps.
You know what?

15:44.475 --> 15:45.840
I... I'm... I'm gonna go
my own way.

15:45.910 --> 15:47.775
Who's gonna
book your gigs?

15:47.912 --> 15:49.812
Marlene's got you locked up.

15:49.881 --> 15:52.679
And she ain't gonna give up
her golden goose.

15:52.784 --> 15:55.480
# Straighten up
and fly right #

15:55.553 --> 15:58.078
# Cool down, papa,
don't you blow your top ##

15:58.156 --> 16:00.351
Hey, Ray Robinson,
you are fantastic.

16:01.259 --> 16:03.557
There you go.
Give me some skin.

16:05.163 --> 16:06.255
What's that?

16:06.331 --> 16:07.491
Jack's card.

16:07.598 --> 16:09.691
I got his number
at the hotel.

16:15.506 --> 16:17.474
Come on, Q.
It's not that complicated.

16:17.542 --> 16:18.873
Now let's just play it again.

16:18.943 --> 16:20.774
That's a B flat,
C 7, scale it up,

16:20.845 --> 16:22.779
and triple it off
the back end.

16:25.083 --> 16:27.244
Yeah, nigger!
Yeah, that's it.

16:28.786 --> 16:31.846
Ray, what did I tell you
about cookin' in the dark?

16:31.923 --> 16:33.584
Are you tryin'
to burn the house down?

16:33.658 --> 16:36.183
Think about it, Marlene.
Uh... uh, What do I need
the light for?

16:36.260 --> 16:38.023
Well, you don't need
to be cookin' anyway.

16:38.096 --> 16:39.654
We brought you
takeout from Oscar's.

16:39.731 --> 16:40.789
Well, get your money back.

16:40.865 --> 16:42.230
I got fried chicken
right here.

16:42.300 --> 16:43.597
Come on, Seven-oh,
try this.

16:43.668 --> 16:45.158
Yeah! About time.

16:47.005 --> 16:48.836
Hey, that's home-cooked,
right there.

16:48.906 --> 16:50.066
Mmm, no, thank you.

16:50.141 --> 16:51.540
This chicken
is the mostest, huh.

16:51.609 --> 16:53.873
Just needs a little hot sauce
and it'll be perfect.

16:53.945 --> 16:55.970
Yeah. So, what did
Jack Lauderdale have to say?

16:56.047 --> 16:57.639
Oh, I clocked him
comin' out the gate.

16:57.715 --> 16:58.977
He's a two-bit hustler.

16:59.050 --> 17:00.210
Oh, I see.

17:00.284 --> 17:02.809
Yeah, turns out the only hit
that Swing Time ever had

17:02.887 --> 17:05.082
<i>was Open the Door, Richard,
which was a joke record.</i>

17:05.156 --> 17:07.021
Uh... uh... uh, what about him
recordin' me?

17:07.090 --> 17:09.457
Oh, he'll record you,
if we pay the freight.

17:09.627 --> 17:11.253
Scratch a liar,
find a thief.

17:12.363 --> 17:13.887
What's that
supposed to mean?

17:13.964 --> 17:15.159
This.

17:15.900 --> 17:17.800
You see I saw
Jack Lauderdale tonight,

17:17.868 --> 17:19.894
and he gave me a $500
advance on my record.

17:19.971 --> 17:22.234
He also said he'll put me
on the road with Lowell Fulson

17:22.306 --> 17:23.829
and pay me three times
what you pay.

17:23.907 --> 17:25.034
Now, that's a lie!

17:25.108 --> 17:28.545
Hey, no way he's not gonna
put some blind man
on the road. Think about it.

17:28.613 --> 17:30.547
I mean, you... you need
watchin' out for.

17:30.615 --> 17:32.845
And he ain't got the time
to look after you
the way I do.

17:32.917 --> 17:35.351
Is that what
you've been doing, Gossie?
Watchin' out for me?

17:35.420 --> 17:37.285
Is that why you get
paid double what I do?

17:38.823 --> 17:39.983
Who told you that?

17:40.058 --> 17:41.116
It's true, ain't it?

17:41.192 --> 17:43.183
You two have been
gaming me since I got here.

17:43.261 --> 17:45.229
Ray, baby, listen...
I ain't listening to you!

17:45.296 --> 17:47.696
Ray, I've... I've been
meaning to talk to you
about that.

17:47.765 --> 17:49.824
Then why aren't you talkin'?

17:52.203 --> 17:54.433
Um, look, Ray, Ray,
let's not do nothin' stupid.

17:54.505 --> 17:56.268
I might be blind,
but I ain't stupid!

17:56.340 --> 17:58.035
Q., get my bag
from upstairs.

17:58.109 --> 17:59.235
What?
Get it!

17:59.310 --> 18:00.800
Wha... right now?
Now.

18:00.878 --> 18:03.108
Ray, man, we done been
through a whole lot.

18:03.181 --> 18:05.911
Ray, now wait a minute.
I can explain everything.

18:06.217 --> 18:07.912
Think about what you're doing.

18:07.985 --> 18:09.850
Ray, Ray, now you're makin'
a big mistake.

18:09.921 --> 18:11.912
That clown is spoutin'
promises that he can't keep.

18:11.989 --> 18:13.752
You'd be a fool
to follow him.

18:13.825 --> 18:15.156
Ray, Ray,
we'll make a new deal!

18:15.226 --> 18:16.352
Whatever makes you happy!

18:16.427 --> 18:18.361
The deal is
you can lay the pipe now.

18:18.429 --> 18:21.865
You'll break your neck
going down these stairs
by yourself. Hang on.

18:22.300 --> 18:23.358
Oh, man.

18:23.434 --> 18:27.200
Ray, I ain't never seen you
do nothing like that, man.
Never.

18:27.271 --> 18:28.966
That ain't nothing,
Seven-oh.

18:41.953 --> 18:43.784
Stop cheating, Ray.

18:44.622 --> 18:47.250
George, you can't catch me.
Come on.

18:47.325 --> 18:48.656
Aretha!

18:49.393 --> 18:50.690
Come on, George.

18:50.761 --> 18:53.252
Aretha Robinson,
have you lost your mind?

18:53.331 --> 18:56.630
Eula, you promised to split
every wash basket with me,
fair and square!

18:56.701 --> 18:57.793
And I did!

18:57.869 --> 18:58.961
Hell, you did!

18:59.036 --> 19:01.129
You charge white folks
one thing and pay me another.

19:01.205 --> 19:02.638
Now who's gonna
wash these?

19:02.707 --> 19:04.197
You can.
Now pay me my money!

19:07.778 --> 19:09.769
Okay, I'm a-giving you
your two little dollars.

19:09.847 --> 19:11.974
But don't you be expectin'
no more work out of me!

19:12.049 --> 19:13.482
I got all I need
out of you.

19:13.618 --> 19:15.051
Ray and George, come on!

19:15.119 --> 19:16.746
That's right.
Get out of my yard

19:16.821 --> 19:18.584
and don't y'all
never come back!

19:21.492 --> 19:24.256
Y'all got to learn
to read and write real good,

19:24.328 --> 19:27.092
so you never have to work
for people like that.

19:27.165 --> 19:28.860
Scratch a liar,
find a thief.

19:28.933 --> 19:29.900
Understand?

19:29.967 --> 19:31.127
Yes, Mama.

19:44.081 --> 19:46.743
Smell that, Ray.
Smell the success.

19:47.018 --> 19:48.417
We're in LA, man,

19:48.486 --> 19:50.784
the place where the Negro
comes to spread his wings.

19:50.855 --> 19:53.255
You... you know, man, I know
my ears ain't deceivin' me.

19:53.324 --> 19:54.348
Is that Art Tatum?

19:54.425 --> 19:56.086
It sure is, baby.
You want to meet him?

19:56.160 --> 19:58.822
I... I can't meet him.
A- Art Tatum is the most.

20:04.068 --> 20:08.528
So, Ray, we got to talk
about your name, man:
Robinson.

20:08.606 --> 20:11.507
Sugar Ray got the Robinson
franchise all sewed up.

20:11.576 --> 20:15.239
So I'm thinkin' we go with
your middle name, Charles.

20:15.780 --> 20:17.179
As in, Ray Charles.

20:17.248 --> 20:18.977
I don't care
what you call me, man,

20:19.050 --> 20:20.847
just as long as my name's
on the record.

20:20.918 --> 20:22.317
But we're gonna
toast to that.

20:22.386 --> 20:23.683
Hey, what's the haps, Jack?

20:23.754 --> 20:25.381
Oh, my goodness.
Give me some skin.

20:25.456 --> 20:27.515
What's up, baby?
How you doin'?

20:27.592 --> 20:31.187
Lowell Fulson, meet your new
piano player: Ray Charles.

20:31.262 --> 20:33.822
Ray Charles,
the blind sensation.

20:33.898 --> 20:37.698
Ow! Damn! I'm gonna use that
on the album cover.

20:37.768 --> 20:39.201
He's really
the sensation.

20:39.270 --> 20:41.101
I... I love your music,
Mr. Fulson.

20:41.172 --> 20:42.571
Uh, the man's got taste.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.938
Hey, and the man ain't
been on the road

20:45.009 --> 20:47.239
with a band before,
so now you take care of him.

20:47.311 --> 20:48.676
Like my own brother.

20:52.250 --> 20:53.512
Ray.

20:54.385 --> 20:55.511
I'm gonna be right back.

20:55.586 --> 20:56.644
All right.

20:57.154 --> 20:59.782
Yeah, you got the one
on the left.

20:59.857 --> 21:01.620
Look here,
let me do the talking.

21:30.454 --> 21:31.978
Don't go inside that place.

21:32.056 --> 21:33.489
You know what Mama said.

21:33.557 --> 21:36.025
Go home
and don't tell Mama nothin'.

21:36.560 --> 21:37.925
Go, George.

21:42.400 --> 21:44.231
George, get out of here!

22:09.994 --> 22:12.827
Hey, boy,
who let you in?

22:13.064 --> 22:15.191
You must be
Aretha's son, huh?

22:15.266 --> 22:17.496
Yes, sir.
Ray Charles Robinson.

22:17.968 --> 22:20.698
I've been seeing you
sneakin' around here.

22:21.038 --> 22:22.733
You like the piano, huh?

22:23.307 --> 22:25.332
Come on, you want
to learn how to play?

22:25.409 --> 22:26.706
Come on over here.

22:26.777 --> 22:28.506
Let me show you how to play.
Come on.

22:28.579 --> 22:30.809
I'm gonna teach you
how to play.

22:30.881 --> 22:33.816
What we'll do, I'm gonna teach
you three notes, right?

22:33.884 --> 22:35.977
This is the first note,
right here.

22:37.555 --> 22:38.647
Play that.

22:39.924 --> 22:42.154
And here's the second note,
right here.

22:43.327 --> 22:44.555
Play that.

22:46.263 --> 22:47.924
Here's the third note.

22:50.968 --> 22:52.265
Now, here's the way
it goes.

22:52.336 --> 22:53.928
Listen.
Listen closely, now.

22:57.675 --> 22:59.006
Play that.

23:00.578 --> 23:01.909
Good!

23:03.080 --> 23:04.843
Try the other notes.

23:13.691 --> 23:15.158
Every club we hit,

23:15.226 --> 23:17.694
it's your responsibility
to rehearse the band.

23:17.795 --> 23:19.820
These are some
lazy-ass bastards,

23:19.897 --> 23:22.195
so you gotta make sure
that they don't slough off.

23:22.600 --> 23:24.727
You gotta be ready
and dressed to open the show.

23:24.802 --> 23:27.168
Now, Lowell likes to take
a nap before he goes on.

23:27.238 --> 23:30.298
You just do your thing
until he feels like
comin' out.

23:30.374 --> 23:33.275
And when Lowell's playin',
you keep the band sharp.

23:33.344 --> 23:34.333
Uh... uh, just one thing.

23:34.412 --> 23:35.344
What?

23:35.413 --> 23:38.007
Did Jack tell you that
I have to be paid in singles?

23:38.082 --> 23:40.482
You just do your job,
you're gonna get your money.

23:41.085 --> 23:43.451
# Baby, come on, down #

23:43.521 --> 23:46.684
# Your daddy's
in the heart of town #

23:50.428 --> 23:51.918
# Come on down #

23:51.996 --> 23:55.454
# Your daddy's
in the heart of town #

24:01.705 --> 24:04.037
How'd you get the name
Fathead anyway?

24:04.108 --> 24:05.598
Why do they call me
Fathead?

24:05.743 --> 24:07.267
Nah, you don't want to hear.

24:07.344 --> 24:09.335
But this is what
I really want to know.

24:09.413 --> 24:11.472
Do any of you
fine young ladies know

24:11.549 --> 24:13.915
where we can get a nice steak
this time of night?

24:13.984 --> 24:17.010
You mean something big,
thick, and juicy?

24:17.087 --> 24:18.884
Oh, yeah,
that's just what I mean.

24:20.124 --> 24:22.388
Fathead, where you guys
headed, man?

24:22.960 --> 24:25.053
I ain't babysittin'
no blind cat.

24:26.063 --> 24:27.462
Uh, I'm sorry, Ray,

24:27.531 --> 24:30.261
but, uh, the law says
there's only six to a cab.

24:30.334 --> 24:32.359
Come on, ladies,
let's get out of here.

25:29.093 --> 25:31.288
# Everyday #

25:36.467 --> 25:40.130
# Everyday I have the blues #

25:46.610 --> 25:49.977
# Everyday, everyday #

25:54.285 --> 25:56.583
Pay up, baby!
Yeah, that's all right.

25:56.654 --> 25:58.918
I been shootin' craps
since I was 12 years old.

25:58.989 --> 26:01.549
Don't never shoot craps
on a white woman's grave.

26:01.625 --> 26:02.614
Why not?

26:02.693 --> 26:03.751
It's bad luck.

26:03.827 --> 26:07.228
<i># You know bad luck
and trouble, people #</i>

26:10.601 --> 26:13.263
# Well, you know
I had my share #

26:19.577 --> 26:21.272
That's for being
late to the bus.

26:21.345 --> 26:22.835
Wilbur,
you a low-down piece...

26:22.913 --> 26:24.380
You better move on.

26:29.853 --> 26:32.014
Ah, Mr. One-dollar Bill.

26:33.057 --> 26:36.720
$5, $10, $15, $20...

26:37.828 --> 26:40.490
Now, you like to start
counting that again?

26:41.699 --> 26:43.530
All right, damn you.

26:45.869 --> 26:48.030
$284, $285...

26:48.105 --> 26:50.938
Listen, man, I ain't
no damn seein'- eye dog.

26:51.008 --> 26:54.444
<i># You know
ain't nobody worried
about me #</i>

26:56.013 --> 27:00.712
# I don't see nobody,
nobody cryin' ##

27:07.691 --> 27:10.159
Fathead, open up. Open up.
I got to take a leak.

27:13.163 --> 27:15.961
Hey, what you doing, man?
Close the door, Fat!

27:16.200 --> 27:18.498
Say, Ray, we'll be in here
for a little while.

27:18.569 --> 27:21.367
Use the women's can,
down there on your right.

27:21.438 --> 27:22.996
I don't want to use
the women's can.

27:23.073 --> 27:24.097
This way.

27:43.894 --> 27:45.225
Oh, God!

27:46.163 --> 27:48.028
Say, Ray,
you all right?

27:49.199 --> 27:50.928
Yeah, I must have slipped
on the wet.

27:51.001 --> 27:52.093
There's a pipe broke.

27:52.169 --> 27:53.727
There's water everywhere.
You see it?

27:53.804 --> 27:55.704
Let's go, man.
Close the door.

27:55.773 --> 27:57.172
All right,
quit playing, Ray.

27:57.241 --> 27:59.732
We'll be in here a while.
Now go on now!

28:07.451 --> 28:08.475
Where you from, Ray?

28:08.552 --> 28:09.780
North Florida.

28:10.187 --> 28:11.677
Oh, North Florida boy.

28:12.222 --> 28:13.382
Your people
still down there?

28:13.524 --> 28:14.684
No.

28:15.893 --> 28:17.019
All right.

28:17.528 --> 28:19.052
Hey, uh, pardon me
for askin',

28:19.129 --> 28:21.029
but how do you
get around so good

28:21.098 --> 28:22.998
without a cane
or a dog?

28:23.767 --> 28:26.668
How do you get around so good
without a cane or dog?

28:27.271 --> 28:28.863
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to pry.

28:30.941 --> 28:33.034
My ears got to be
my eyes, man. Its...

28:33.844 --> 28:35.106
Everything sounds different.

28:35.179 --> 28:37.238
You know that's why
I wear hard-soled shoes,

28:37.314 --> 28:39.305
so I can hear my footsteps
echo off the wall.

28:39.383 --> 28:42.614
So when I pass by
an open doorway,
the sound changes.

28:42.720 --> 28:44.119
Wow. That's cool.

28:44.588 --> 28:48.183
You know you got to learn
pretty quick if you want
to get around on your own.

28:48.258 --> 28:49.384
Yeah.

28:50.027 --> 28:52.291
You know, during the war,
there was a whole lot

28:52.362 --> 28:54.557
I had to learn fast,
or I wouldn't be here.

28:57.134 --> 28:59.534
Seein' that much death
ain't natural.

29:01.405 --> 29:03.737
Yeah, seein' death
ain't natural.

29:08.212 --> 29:10.203
Boys, get from
'round that still.

29:10.280 --> 29:11.679
Y'all know
better than that.

29:11.749 --> 29:13.182
Come on, catch me.

29:18.522 --> 29:20.717
Stay from 'round this fire
and get clean.

29:20.791 --> 29:22.383
Dinner will be ready soon.

29:22.459 --> 29:23.949
Hear me, Ray?

29:25.729 --> 29:26.991
I got you.
I got you.

29:27.064 --> 29:28.429
No, you didn't.
You missed me.

29:28.499 --> 29:29.796
Stop cheatin', Ray.

29:29.867 --> 29:32.495
Okay, you got me.

29:32.569 --> 29:34.298
But I got you back.

29:34.371 --> 29:36.100
I'm not playin' no more.

29:36.340 --> 29:37.534
Sissy!

29:39.243 --> 29:41.609
Come on, Ray.
Let's go swimmin'.

29:43.781 --> 29:46.306
Let's go swim
in Mama's washtub.

29:47.317 --> 29:49.444
Ray, come on, Ray,
play with me.

29:49.720 --> 29:51.813
You better get down
before Mama sees you.

29:51.889 --> 29:53.356
I'm a giant!

29:57.494 --> 29:58.961
Some giant.

30:00.030 --> 30:02.828
Come on, George.
I ain't playin' this game.

30:03.867 --> 30:05.391
That ain't funny.

30:07.337 --> 30:09.999
Boys, I got some field peas
and rice cooking.

30:10.073 --> 30:12.667
And there's that smothered
corn left from yesterday.

30:12.743 --> 30:16.736
And if you're real good,
I might have two pieces
of peach cobbler.

30:17.481 --> 30:20.177
Ray, didn't I tell you
to get in this house?

30:23.587 --> 30:25.179
Dear God, no!

30:29.927 --> 30:31.121
That's Aretha's boy!

30:31.261 --> 30:32.592
Breathe, baby, breathe.

30:32.663 --> 30:36.064
Just breathe, baby, breathe.
Let it out!

30:36.133 --> 30:37.930
Let it out, please!

30:38.068 --> 30:39.433
Breathe for your mama, now.

30:39.503 --> 30:40.834
Come on, George.

30:41.071 --> 30:43.198
Why didn't you do somethin'?

30:43.707 --> 30:45.140
Why didn't you call me?

30:46.710 --> 30:48.371
Help us, Lord!

30:48.445 --> 30:50.072
The Lord done took him home.

30:59.690 --> 31:00.918
All right.

31:01.525 --> 31:03.755
Food and piss stop.
Open it up.

31:07.064 --> 31:09.760
The food is hot.
You've got 45 minutes.

31:10.200 --> 31:12.225
I could eat a horse.
Where's it?

31:12.369 --> 31:14.394
Follow your nose.
Right over there.

31:15.105 --> 31:16.231
Wilbur.

31:16.306 --> 31:17.364
What?

31:17.441 --> 31:19.739
45 minutes
ain't enough time.

31:19.810 --> 31:21.300
We need more
than that, Jack.

31:21.378 --> 31:22.970
Not to eat,
you don't.

31:23.046 --> 31:25.139
Now if you got other business,
you better choose,

31:25.215 --> 31:26.739
because this bus
is rollin' on time.

31:26.817 --> 31:30.048
Come on, Mercedes got
a washroom in the back.

31:30.387 --> 31:32.947
And you,
you can smell it.

31:34.625 --> 31:35.649
Jeff.

31:35.726 --> 31:36.715
Yes, sir?

31:36.793 --> 31:38.055
Uh, could you help me
in there?

31:38.128 --> 31:39.527
Sure thing, Ray.

31:39.596 --> 31:40.620
Hey, Mercedes.

31:40.697 --> 31:43.495
Hey, baby.
I hope you wiped your feet
before you came in here.

31:43.567 --> 31:45.000
There you go. Come on.
Take that.

31:45.068 --> 31:46.933
The bathroom's right there
in front of you.

31:47.004 --> 31:47.971
Okay.

31:48.038 --> 31:49.300
You want me
to fix you a plate?

31:49.373 --> 31:50.670
Uh, no, I'm... I'm fine.

31:50.974 --> 31:52.134
All right.

31:52.209 --> 31:54.074
Sweet potato pie it is.

31:55.512 --> 31:56.638
Whoo, let's go, man.

31:56.713 --> 31:58.476
That was a long
bus ride, wasn't it?

31:58.548 --> 31:59.640
Oh, come on, man.

31:59.716 --> 32:02.810
Hey, man!
The can's down the hall.

32:02.886 --> 32:04.751
I know where the can is.
What y'all doing?

32:04.821 --> 32:06.448
Do yourself a favor
and leave.

32:06.523 --> 32:08.388
I'll leave when
I'm gettin' ready to leave.

32:08.458 --> 32:09.982
Come on, Fathead,
I want in.

32:10.060 --> 32:11.755
This ain't no weed, Ray.

32:11.895 --> 32:13.829
And we ain't
snorting no bitch.

32:13.897 --> 32:15.125
This is boy.

32:15.198 --> 32:17.666
Boy'll make your ass
null and void.

32:17.734 --> 32:19.326
So get on out of here, man.

32:19.403 --> 32:21.234
Null and void,
just like my life.

32:21.305 --> 32:22.932
I'll be right at home.

32:23.006 --> 32:24.701
Look, I ain't gonna
wait all night.

32:24.808 --> 32:26.469
Hell, it's his funeral, man.

32:28.545 --> 32:30.570
Ray, let's go get
something to eat.

32:30.647 --> 32:32.239
I'll leave
when I get a taste.

32:32.316 --> 32:33.510
Ray, what you gonna do, man?

32:33.583 --> 32:35.016
This train's pullin' out,
brother.

32:35.085 --> 32:36.916
I ain't having nothin'
to do with this.

32:36.987 --> 32:38.682
I warned you, Ray.
Come on, man.

32:38.755 --> 32:39.949
I been warned.

32:40.023 --> 32:41.285
Sit down, Ray. Right there.

32:41.358 --> 32:42.882
I'm gonna take you
on a little ride.

32:42.960 --> 32:45.622
It'll cost you, though.
You got some cash?

32:45.696 --> 32:47.129
Will this do?

32:47.898 --> 32:48.887
That'll do.

32:51.134 --> 32:52.999
Where you been?
Where them other fools?

32:53.070 --> 32:54.537
Come on,
get it while it's hot!

32:55.906 --> 32:58.238
You're going to feel
a little pinch.

33:00.911 --> 33:02.503
I ain't givin'
up on you, boy.

33:03.947 --> 33:05.471
Feel it, baby?

33:06.650 --> 33:08.447
Just take the ride.

33:09.586 --> 33:11.417
It's better than sex.

33:11.788 --> 33:14.120
There ain't nothin'
better than sex.

33:19.563 --> 33:21.656
<i># We will walk #</i>

33:21.732 --> 33:26.669
# through the streets
of the city #

33:27.270 --> 33:28.897
# Of the city #

33:29.740 --> 33:33.198

33:33.276 --> 33:38.213

34:06.676 --> 34:09.338

35:11.374 --> 35:14.400
Ray, come on, let me put
this salve on I got
from Dr. McLeod.

35:14.478 --> 35:16.002
No, I don't like it.
It stings.

35:16.079 --> 35:17.546
Boy, get up here.

35:18.115 --> 35:21.016
I paid a whole dollar for it.
It better work.

35:21.118 --> 35:23.586
Now hold up your head,
like the doctor says.

35:23.653 --> 35:25.621
This is gonna
make you feel better.

35:30.026 --> 35:32.221
Ray, come on in
for dinner.

35:32.295 --> 35:34.593
And stop rubbin' those eyes.

35:46.543 --> 35:48.568
Ray, I won't beat around
the bush with you.

35:48.645 --> 35:49.907
You're goin' blind.

35:49.980 --> 35:53.347
The doctor's sayin'
there's nothing they can do,
so we got to do it ourselves.

35:53.416 --> 35:54.474
Yes, ma'am, I know, but...

35:54.551 --> 35:55.518
Stop it.

35:55.585 --> 35:57.143
Stop it right now.

35:57.220 --> 35:59.154
We ain't got no time
for no tears.

35:59.222 --> 36:00.883
Ain't nobody gonna
have no pity on you

36:00.957 --> 36:02.254
just 'cause
you're goin' blind.

36:02.325 --> 36:03.485
Now wipe them eyes.

36:03.560 --> 36:04.959
Yes, ma'am.

36:06.963 --> 36:09.261
Okay, I'll show you
how to do something once.

36:09.332 --> 36:10.959
I'll help you
if you mess up twice.

36:11.034 --> 36:12.729
But the third time,
you're on your own,

36:12.802 --> 36:15.168
'cause that's the way
it is in the world.

36:15.238 --> 36:16.728
All right,
now get up.

36:18.575 --> 36:21.806
Remember, you goin' blind,
but you ain't stupid.

36:23.914 --> 36:25.472
Remember how many stairs
there were?

36:25.549 --> 36:26.880
Four.

36:26.950 --> 36:30.442
Good. You're gonna
have to learn
how to use your memory.

36:30.520 --> 36:31.680
Now turn around.

36:31.755 --> 36:33.689
I want you
to hold out your hands,

36:33.757 --> 36:36.692
and use them as your eyes,
and find the door.

36:37.894 --> 36:40.920
Good.
That's real good, baby.

36:51.241 --> 36:52.230
Hi.

36:59.082 --> 37:02.813
# Baby,
let me hold your hand #

37:07.057 --> 37:10.823
# Till I make you understand #

37:12.696 --> 37:14.960
# Oh, baby #

37:18.535 --> 37:21.561
# Let me hold your hand #

37:29.212 --> 37:31.840
# I really true believe #

37:31.915 --> 37:35.578
This fool makes one record,
and you'd think he's
the star of the band.

37:35.652 --> 37:38.485
Well, he's got somethin',
ain't he?

37:39.089 --> 37:40.954
His wax won't
even hit the charts.

37:41.625 --> 37:43.490
You're still the man.

37:45.095 --> 37:47.461
# I want you to know #

37:49.733 --> 37:51.030
# I'm in love ##

37:51.101 --> 37:52.090
She wasn't that fine.

37:52.168 --> 37:53.567
There's somethin'
wrong with you.

37:53.637 --> 37:56.970
No, man, she's fine.
She's fine.
You leave her alone.

37:57.540 --> 37:58.507
Look at Ray.

37:59.442 --> 38:00.568
You see that?

38:00.644 --> 38:02.305
He feels her wrist
'cause he figures

38:02.379 --> 38:04.677
that's the way to tell
if she's good-looking or not.

38:04.748 --> 38:07.182
You know I had my eye on you
all night long.

38:07.250 --> 38:09.241
Oh, he right this time.

38:11.221 --> 38:14.190
See what a little fame does
to Null and Void?

38:14.557 --> 38:17.720
Anybody see that
fine-looking gal
in the yellow dress?

38:19.296 --> 38:20.422
You hear this man?

38:20.497 --> 38:21.987
You snooze, you lose.

38:22.065 --> 38:23.794
We gonna dock your pay, man.

38:23.867 --> 38:25.801
That's $2 off of your busride.

38:30.607 --> 38:34.099
<i># Baby,
I want you by my side #</i>

38:37.013 --> 38:38.275
<i># I do #</i>

38:41.985 --> 38:44.579
<i># I want you to know #</i>

38:46.856 --> 38:50.348
<i># Our love
we will never hide #</i>

38:51.661 --> 38:53.959
<i># Oh, no, no, no ##</i>

38:55.765 --> 38:57.426
All right, who's next?

38:58.401 --> 38:59.834
It's a shame, Jimmy.

38:59.903 --> 39:01.894
You're just gonna
piss this right up your arm.

39:01.971 --> 39:04.531
You don't tell me
what to do with my money.

39:04.908 --> 39:08.537
All right, come on. Step up.
The $1 sensation.

39:13.783 --> 39:15.580
You wanna keep counting?

39:15.652 --> 39:17.381
What's the matter with you,
boy?

39:17.454 --> 39:18.853
$50 ain't good enough for you?

39:18.922 --> 39:21.015
That ain't $50. Keep counting.

39:21.591 --> 39:24.924
I guess you want charity,
since that record
of yours ain't selling.

39:27.997 --> 39:29.464
Get him off my back!

39:34.270 --> 39:35.931
Break it up!

39:36.072 --> 39:37.733
What the hell's
going on in here?

39:38.274 --> 39:41.141
The blind sensation don't like
the money I'm trying
to pay him!

39:41.211 --> 39:42.269
He's cheating me! I quit!

39:42.345 --> 39:44.006
Oh, you lying son of a bitch!

39:44.314 --> 39:46.407
Don't be fighting nobody
that can see!

39:46.483 --> 39:49.213
Listen, I ain't
runnnin' around lookin' for
singles for this chump!

39:49.285 --> 39:50.377
There's $50 here, Ray.

39:50.453 --> 39:51.442
You see that, fool?

39:51.521 --> 39:54.354
Shut up, Wilbur!
Ray, from now on,
I'll handle your pay myself.

39:54.424 --> 39:55.413
I'm tired of this!

39:55.492 --> 39:57.221
I'll tell Jack to
find you somebody else!

39:57.293 --> 39:58.521
You sure?
It's cold out there.

39:58.595 --> 40:00.620
Don't worry about me,
I can take care of myself.

40:00.697 --> 40:02.858
Ray!
Damn it, Wilbur!

40:02.932 --> 40:03.956
Let him go!

40:04.033 --> 40:05.523
What we gonna do now?

40:13.343 --> 40:17.040
"After the death of Moses, the
Lord spake unto Joshua saying:

40:17.113 --> 40:19.513
"'Moses my servant is dead.

40:19.582 --> 40:22.050
"'Now therefore arise.
Go over to Jordan.

40:22.118 --> 40:23.244
"'Be not afraid,

40:23.319 --> 40:25.412
For the Lord thy God
is with thee. "'

40:25.488 --> 40:26.955
Mr. Charles.

40:27.457 --> 40:28.822
Who is it?

40:28.925 --> 40:30.586
Mr. Charles,
my name is Ahmet Ertegun.

40:30.660 --> 40:32.252
May I have
a moment of your time?

40:35.999 --> 40:37.899
What do you want, man?
I'm at church.

40:37.967 --> 40:40.265
I'm sorry.
I'll come back later.

40:40.403 --> 40:42.462
You're here now.
What do you want?

40:43.740 --> 40:45.867
My company, Atlantic Records,
has acquired

40:45.942 --> 40:48.103
your contract
from Swing Time.

40:48.611 --> 40:50.340
I'd like
to discuss your future.

40:50.413 --> 40:53.246
Hold on. Don't jive me now.
I ain't for sale.

40:53.483 --> 40:54.973
May I sit down?

40:57.620 --> 40:59.588
You see, Mr. Charles,

41:00.290 --> 41:02.417
Jack Lauderdale
has found himself,

41:02.559 --> 41:04.686
shall we say,
a little overextended,

41:05.128 --> 41:07.926
and has had to
unload some of his talent.

41:07.997 --> 41:09.965
When your name
came up, I jumped at

41:10.033 --> 41:11.967
the chance to work with you.
I'm a big fan.

41:12.035 --> 41:13.935
What if I want to go
to another company?

41:14.003 --> 41:16.437
There's a guy out there
right now that is willing
to pay me

41:16.506 --> 41:18.872
seven cents a record.
Can you do that?

41:19.242 --> 41:22.040
Man, I could promise you
15 cents a record,

41:22.879 --> 41:26.315
but you won't get it
any more than
he'll pay you seven.

41:28.051 --> 41:31.214
What I will do
is promise you
five cents a record

41:31.387 --> 41:33.685
and pay you five cents
a record.

41:34.457 --> 41:37.722
If you think pennies,
Mr. Charles, you get pennies.

41:38.595 --> 41:40.324
You think dollars,

41:41.331 --> 41:42.923
you get dollars.

41:44.901 --> 41:47.665
I like how you put
things together, man.

41:48.171 --> 41:49.661
Ahem, you know what?

41:50.173 --> 41:52.698
Omelet,
you're all right with me.

41:53.109 --> 41:54.303
Ahmet.
Ahmet.

41:54.377 --> 41:55.537
What kind of name is that?

41:55.612 --> 41:56.840
I'm Turkish.

41:56.946 --> 41:58.140
Well, you know what?

41:58.214 --> 42:01.115
I guess
Jack Lauderdale's bad luck
is my good fortune.

42:01.251 --> 42:04.311
I knew that Atlantic Records
was bigger than Swing Time.

42:04.387 --> 42:06.947
You guys do good music.
I dig Atlantic.

42:07.023 --> 42:08.490
You could have fooled me.

42:08.558 --> 42:11.254
Well, you know,
I gotta keep my eye
on you city boys.

42:11.828 --> 42:13.659
Down home,
we call it "country dumb."

42:15.765 --> 42:17.630
Hey, man, it ain't Turkish.

42:22.672 --> 42:24.970
# Went to see my sweetheart #

42:25.875 --> 42:28.639
# Last night around
about ten #

42:29.212 --> 42:32.579
# She said, move, sweet papa #

42:33.416 --> 42:35.941
# Squeeze me
every now and then #

42:36.185 --> 42:37.914
What do you think?

42:37.987 --> 42:40.387
Man, nobody wants
another Nat King Cole.

42:41.558 --> 42:43.526
# 'Cause she sleep that way #

42:43.593 --> 42:46.619
# The midnight hour #

42:47.864 --> 42:50.458
# Has found me lonely #

42:51.701 --> 42:53.601
# So unhappy #

42:54.904 --> 42:56.667
# As I can be #

42:56.839 --> 42:59.706
Ahmet, it's just
like Charles Brown.

43:01.911 --> 43:04.345
Okay, I'll talk to him.

43:06.950 --> 43:09.817
All right, fellas,
that's a cut.
That's a cut, fellas.

43:10.453 --> 43:11.715
Fellas!

43:11.788 --> 43:13.119
<i>Band can take five.</i>

43:13.256 --> 43:14.587
He just don't get it.

43:14.657 --> 43:17.649
You either sound original,
or you got nothin'.

43:17.760 --> 43:19.955
Ahmet,
what'd you think of that?

43:20.096 --> 43:23.259
Ray, I want to tell you
something, and I don't want
you to take it wrong.

43:23.333 --> 43:24.664
Then give it to me right.

43:24.734 --> 43:28.135
I signed you
because I sensed
something special in you

43:28.204 --> 43:31.401
not because you sound like
Nat Cole or Charles Brown.

43:31.474 --> 43:33.305
I thought you like what I do.

43:33.376 --> 43:35.310
We... we love the timbre
of your voice,

43:35.378 --> 43:37.608
we like your virtuosity,
your energy...

43:37.680 --> 43:38.942
But not my music.

43:39.015 --> 43:40.448
Come on, man,
I didn't say that.

43:40.950 --> 43:42.975
Ahmet, this is what I do, man.

43:43.052 --> 43:45.179
I gotta make a living.
This is what the people want.

43:45.254 --> 43:46.846
I don't know no other way.

43:46.923 --> 43:48.652
We got to help you find one.

43:48.725 --> 43:51.057
Look, let's try a little
change of pace, okay?

43:51.127 --> 43:52.526
You're familiar
with stride piano?

43:52.595 --> 43:55.894
You kidding me, man?
The man who I learned the
piano from is a stride player.

43:55.965 --> 43:58.991
<i>Okay, I got a song.
It's called The Mess Around.</i>

43:59.068 --> 44:00.899
<i>The Mess Around.
Cute title. Who wrote it?</i>

44:00.970 --> 44:02.369
I did.

44:02.605 --> 44:04.038
Ah, you wrote it.

44:04.107 --> 44:05.096
Yeah.

44:05.508 --> 44:06.873
Well, sing it to me, man.

44:07.143 --> 44:08.303
Sing it?
Yeah.

44:08.378 --> 44:10.039
It ain't like
I can read the lyrics.

44:10.113 --> 44:12.707
Okay.
Well, it's the key of G.

44:12.782 --> 44:14.215
Okay. Key of G.

44:15.351 --> 44:16.340
Uh-huh.

44:17.153 --> 44:18.142
Yeah.

44:18.321 --> 44:21.154
Yeah, but it's a kind of
Pete Johnson thing.

44:21.257 --> 44:22.622
Pete Johnson.

44:24.427 --> 44:26.088
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

44:26.195 --> 44:28.254
You like that?
Here we go. Two, three, four.

44:28.331 --> 44:31.630
# You can talk
about the pit barbecue #

44:31.701 --> 44:33.931
# The band was jumpin',
the people, too #

44:34.003 --> 44:35.994
# They're doin'
the mess around #

44:36.839 --> 44:38.864
# They're doin'
the mess around #

44:39.742 --> 44:41.676
# They're doin'
the mess around #

44:41.744 --> 44:43.735
# Everybody doin'
the mess around ##

44:43.813 --> 44:45.974
All right, that's good.
Let me take it from here.

44:46.049 --> 44:49.610
# Now this band's gonna
play from nine to one #

44:49.686 --> 44:52.280
# Everybody here's gonna
have some fun #

44:52.388 --> 44:54.151
# Doin' the mess around #

44:54.924 --> 44:57.154
# Ah, doin' the mess around #

44:58.761 --> 45:00.956
# They doin' the mess around #

45:01.064 --> 45:03.157
# Everybody doin'
the mess around #

45:05.301 --> 45:08.737
# Now you see that girl
with that diamond ring #

45:09.372 --> 45:12.170
# She knows
how to shake that thing #

45:12.642 --> 45:14.166
# Mess around #

45:14.744 --> 45:16.712
# I declare
she can mess around #

45:18.314 --> 45:20.043
# Ah, mess around #

45:20.450 --> 45:22.816
# Everybody do
the mess around ##

45:28.891 --> 45:30.415
Now we got something!

45:30.493 --> 45:31.983
That's all right there.

45:33.496 --> 45:34.758
What do you think, Ahmet?

45:34.831 --> 45:35.855
Great, Ray!

45:35.932 --> 45:37.058
Unbelievable!

45:37.133 --> 45:38.225
Who's that?

45:39.235 --> 45:41.430
Ray, I want you to meet
my new partner, Jerry.

45:41.537 --> 45:43.095
Mr. Ray Charles,
Jerry Wexler.

45:43.172 --> 45:44.161
Hey.

45:44.240 --> 45:47.300
Don't worry, Ray.
I'm going to step back,
I'm gonna watch,

45:47.376 --> 45:49.776
I'm gonna learn
how to produce a record.
I'm in awe.

45:49.846 --> 45:51.074
That was out of sight.

45:51.147 --> 45:52.944
That's some running
and riffing, man!

45:53.249 --> 45:54.944
Well,
this'll make you shout, man.

46:03.059 --> 46:05.823
<i>We're listening to that
new recording, Mess Around</i>

46:05.895 --> 46:08.193
<i>by Atlantic recording artist,
Ray Charles.</i>

46:08.264 --> 46:11.756
<i>And we have the gentleman
live here in the KCOH studios.</i>

46:11.834 --> 46:14.894
So, Ray, when you're not
making your own music,
what do you listen to?

46:14.971 --> 46:18.634
You know what, the fact is,
King Bee, I really
and truly love gospel.

46:18.708 --> 46:21.609
One of my favorite groups
is from right here in Houston:

46:21.677 --> 46:23.542
The Cecil Shaw Singers.

46:23.746 --> 46:27.273
You heard it:
Ray Charles endorses
Houston's own Cecil Shaw.

46:27.350 --> 46:29.284
We'll be playing
gospel all day Sunday

46:29.352 --> 46:31.047
but right now,
let's hear some more

46:31.120 --> 46:32.747
<i>of that Mess Around
by Ray Charles.</i>

46:32.822 --> 46:34.153
<i>K.B., line 1.</i>

46:36.526 --> 46:37.891
King Bee.

46:39.595 --> 46:40.584
Mmm-hmm.

46:41.597 --> 46:43.258
Yeah, he's right here.

46:43.900 --> 46:46.460
Miss Della Antwine
of the Cecil Shaw Singers.

46:49.939 --> 46:51.770
Hello, Miss Antwine.

46:52.175 --> 46:54.939
<i>You sung tenor in
Jesus Is My Shepherd, right?</i>

46:55.011 --> 46:56.239
Yes.

46:57.046 --> 46:58.809
How did you pick me out?

46:58.881 --> 47:01.873
Actually,
I... I hear like you see.

47:02.618 --> 47:05.678
Like that hummingbird
outside the window,
for instance.

47:11.861 --> 47:13.123
I can't hear her.

47:13.196 --> 47:14.458
You have to listen.

47:32.515 --> 47:33.573
Yes.

47:33.649 --> 47:34.638
Yeah.

47:34.917 --> 47:36.077
Yes, you can.

47:36.152 --> 47:37.176
OH-OH.

47:37.253 --> 47:38.242
You hear that?

47:38.321 --> 47:39.345
What?

47:40.089 --> 47:42.250
Her heart just
skipped a beat.

47:44.493 --> 47:46.358
Oh, did you like my record?

47:46.662 --> 47:49.028
The one that King Bee
was playin'?

47:50.466 --> 47:52.093
It was very nice.

47:52.335 --> 47:54.530
Different than the others.

47:55.104 --> 47:57.038
I've heard
a lot of your music.

47:57.106 --> 47:58.664
Was it very nice, too?

47:58.741 --> 48:01.005
Look, Miss Antwine, if you
don't really like the record,

48:01.077 --> 48:04.478
you ain't got to
beat around the bush with me.
I mean, my mama never did.

48:04.547 --> 48:06.845
It's not that I don't
enjoy your music.

48:06.916 --> 48:09.248
It's just that I feel
I've heard it before.

48:09.318 --> 48:11.843
I keep wondering
what the real Ray Charles
sound like.

48:11.921 --> 48:13.411
Ray Charles? Who's he?

48:13.489 --> 48:15.389
Nobody,
if you don't know.

48:15.458 --> 48:16.447
Huh?

48:17.260 --> 48:19.728
Sorry. I should have
kept my mouth shut.

48:19.795 --> 48:21.990
Oh, no, no.
Then you wouldn't be you.

48:23.199 --> 48:25.599
You know, it's not
like I haven't heard
that before.

48:25.668 --> 48:29.001
I guess I just, uh, never
really listened, that's all.

48:31.207 --> 48:34.176
Ain't nobody ever put
it that sweet, I guess.

48:51.394 --> 48:53.294
You know what,
Miss Della Bea Antwine?

48:53.362 --> 48:55.489
You really are a country girl.
You know that?

48:55.564 --> 48:57.532
Yes.
How'd you know?

48:57.600 --> 48:59.659
I could tell by
the way you ordered.

48:59.735 --> 49:01.896
"Let me get molasses
with my cornbread."

49:03.139 --> 49:04.834
Were you raised
on a farm?

49:04.907 --> 49:07.740
My mother did
a little sharecropping
in Florida.

49:07.810 --> 49:09.300
Is she still there?

49:09.378 --> 49:12.211
God bless her heart,
she passed away
when I went to school.

49:12.281 --> 49:13.771
Ray, I'm sorry.

49:14.250 --> 49:15.945
She never was
real healthy.

49:16.018 --> 49:18.578
She just worked
herself to death,
poor thing.

49:18.688 --> 49:21.452
That's why she didn't
want me carrying around
no tin cup.

49:21.524 --> 49:23.253
The kids
I went to school with,

49:23.326 --> 49:26.022
they were doing basket-weavin'
and wickerwork.

49:26.896 --> 49:29.194
But not you.
Because of your gift.

49:29.298 --> 49:30.925
Because of my ears.

49:31.233 --> 49:33.133
See, I can mimic
damn near anybody,

49:33.202 --> 49:35.898
and I... I... I... I make
a pretty decent
living at it.

49:35.972 --> 49:38.031
It's just, if I
change my style up

49:38.107 --> 49:39.631
and people
really don't dig it,

49:39.709 --> 49:41.973
I mean, what am I
left with, you know?

49:42.211 --> 49:44.577
I mean, when you're blind,
Miss Antwine,

49:44.714 --> 49:46.807
you ain't got
that many choices.

49:48.050 --> 49:50.541
Seem to me
like you got all
the choices in the world.

49:51.721 --> 49:53.518
God gave you
the gift to sound

49:53.589 --> 49:55.887
like anybody you please,
even yourself.

49:57.626 --> 49:59.821
We're here.
This is where I live.

50:00.963 --> 50:02.794
Well, you think
the preacher'd let me in?

50:02.865 --> 50:05.197
I mean, uh, I'm a sinner,
but I need a little prayer.

50:05.267 --> 50:07.758
His wife don't like
me having male company.

50:07.870 --> 50:10.998
Well, tell him there's
a soul out here
that needs savin'.

50:11.774 --> 50:15.175
You know what, Miss Antwine,
you really got me thinkin'.

50:17.013 --> 50:18.480
About what?

50:18.581 --> 50:21.914
About my life.
About my music.

50:24.020 --> 50:25.510
About everything.

50:27.757 --> 50:31.249
Ray, don't... don't you think
we're movin' a little fast?

50:33.195 --> 50:34.958
Listen, I'm... I'm gonna
go to New York

50:35.031 --> 50:37.522
for a couple of weeks,
and when I get back,

50:37.933 --> 50:40.401
you can take it as
slow as you want.

50:43.072 --> 50:44.903
All right, Mr. Charles.

50:46.275 --> 50:48.038
All right, Miss Antwine.

50:48.444 --> 50:50.071
I'll see you
in a couple of weeks.

50:50.146 --> 50:52.171
Well, hold on, now.
Let me call you a cab.

50:52.248 --> 50:53.943
I got it. Three blocks up,

50:54.016 --> 50:56.712
left for two, right for one.

50:56.819 --> 50:58.514
Fifteen giant steps,

50:58.587 --> 51:00.521
and I'm at the
Crystal White Hotel. Hello.

51:07.763 --> 51:10.357
<i>Mess Around was
a positive step for us, Ray.</i>

51:10.433 --> 51:11.559
<i>We're making progress.</i>

51:11.634 --> 51:13.795
Oh, come on, Ahmet.
Now, you've been nice to me.

51:13.869 --> 51:15.632
But I haven't given
you guys any hits.

51:15.704 --> 51:17.262
Atlantic Records
has been good to me,

51:17.339 --> 51:19.034
but if you want me to do
something special,

51:19.108 --> 51:20.473
I'm gonna need my own band.

51:20.943 --> 51:24.174
Oh, man. Taking a band
out on the road
costs a mint, Ray.

51:24.246 --> 51:27.306
I mean, even Joe Morris
is struggling. His band's
had a hit record.

51:27.383 --> 51:29.214
But, Ahmet, listen,
I'm not Joe Morris.

51:29.285 --> 51:31.549
Man, you told me if I think
pennies, I get pennies.

51:31.620 --> 51:33.520
I'm thinking dollars,
man.

51:34.857 --> 51:37.690
Ruth Brown's got
a tour booked in Georgia.

51:38.794 --> 51:40.022
She needs a band.

51:40.096 --> 51:41.120
I... I'll take it.

51:41.197 --> 51:43.927
I could write the charts
for her, I... I could do backup,

51:43.999 --> 51:46.058
and also be an openin' act.

51:49.004 --> 51:50.369
Okay.

51:50.473 --> 51:52.737
But you're going to be
financially responsible.

51:52.808 --> 51:54.742
You're gonna have
to make it work, Ray.

51:54.810 --> 51:57.335
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna make it
do what it do, baby.

51:57.413 --> 51:58.778
Yeah.

52:10.926 --> 52:11.915
Ray!

52:12.161 --> 52:14.595
Miss Antwine,
it's been two weeks.

52:14.663 --> 52:16.392
It's been three.

52:22.071 --> 52:24.539
Now, where's the preacher at?
And the wife?

52:24.640 --> 52:26.733
They in Dallas till Monday.

52:26.809 --> 52:28.572
Well, hallelujah!

52:38.787 --> 52:40.186
Della Bea.

52:41.056 --> 52:42.853
Kind of like a honey bee,
right?

52:46.795 --> 52:48.456
Can I call you Bea?

52:49.465 --> 52:51.763
Yeah, I'd like that.

52:54.637 --> 52:58.471
There's only been two cats
that I ever really
trusted in my life.

53:00.075 --> 53:03.238
There's Jeff Brown,
he's going to be
my tour manager,

53:04.079 --> 53:06.411
Fathead Newman,
my tenor man

53:08.584 --> 53:10.051
and now you.

53:17.793 --> 53:19.158
But you gotta
do me a favor.

53:19.228 --> 53:21.321
Bea, you gotta
always tell me the truth.

53:21.397 --> 53:23.524
Oh, yeah. Just like
you did before.

53:24.400 --> 53:27.392
Don't feel sorry for me
just 'cause I'm blind.

53:28.504 --> 53:30.995
How could I pity
someone I admire?

53:36.011 --> 53:37.501
Can I play
something for you?

53:37.580 --> 53:39.172
Now?
Yeah.

53:39.248 --> 53:40.374
No, Ray.

53:40.449 --> 53:42.383
Yeah, right now.
Right now. I'm gonna...

53:42.451 --> 53:43.577
Ray!

53:47.456 --> 53:49.356
It's right there.
You got it.

53:49.458 --> 53:50.652
Okay.

53:50.726 --> 53:51.954
Yeah, yeah,
this will work.

53:53.128 --> 53:55.460
Now you go ahead
and play. I'm gonna
close these drapes.

53:55.531 --> 53:56.520
All right.

53:56.599 --> 53:58.123
I don't want no
neighbors looking in.

53:58.200 --> 53:59.633
# Well #

54:00.169 --> 54:01.796
# I got a woman #

54:02.771 --> 54:04.204
# way over town #

54:04.773 --> 54:06.297
# She's good to me #

54:07.343 --> 54:08.571
# Oh, yeah #

54:09.411 --> 54:10.901
# I got a woman #

54:11.780 --> 54:13.247
# Way over town #

54:13.315 --> 54:14.304
Ray.

54:14.383 --> 54:15.645
# She's good to me #

54:16.585 --> 54:17.950
# Oh, yeah #

54:18.053 --> 54:19.042
Ray!

54:19.121 --> 54:20.383
# She give me money #

54:20.456 --> 54:21.946
Ray. Ray, that's
sacrilegious.

54:22.024 --> 54:23.048
# When I'm in need ##

54:23.125 --> 54:24.319
What... what?

54:24.393 --> 54:26.088
It's a gospel song.

54:26.829 --> 54:28.888
I know what it is.
I wrote it.

54:29.531 --> 54:31.999
I mean, you told me
to find my own voice.

54:32.067 --> 54:33.659
Well, Bea, this is it.

54:33.736 --> 54:37.866
But it... it ain't... It ain't
right to be changing
gospel music into this.

54:37.940 --> 54:39.840
Into what? Is it...
Is it devil music?

54:39.908 --> 54:42.934
Evil music? Do you think...
Do you think I'm evil, Bea?

54:43.545 --> 54:45.775
Look, I've been
performing gospel

54:45.848 --> 54:48.043
and blues all my life.
It's who I am.

54:48.617 --> 54:52.144
And if I'm gonna
do my own thing,
I... I gotta be natural, right?

54:53.722 --> 54:56.316
I'm singing about
my feelings for you.

54:56.759 --> 54:58.420
About how I love you.

55:00.963 --> 55:03.227
What could be more
natural than that?

55:04.466 --> 55:05.728
Huh, Bea?

55:06.302 --> 55:07.633
Tell me.

55:08.704 --> 55:10.763
More natural
than me and you.

55:11.307 --> 55:12.296
Ray.

55:16.845 --> 55:18.710
# I got a woman #

55:19.381 --> 55:21.372
# Way over town #

55:23.052 --> 55:24.485
# good to me #

55:25.921 --> 55:27.115
# Oh, yeah ##

55:28.557 --> 55:30.991
So we bite the bullet,
we cancel the tour dates.

55:31.060 --> 55:32.925
But what the hell
are we gonna tell Ray?

55:32.995 --> 55:34.826
We just have
to tell him the truth:

55:34.897 --> 55:36.694
Ruth Brown's pregnant,
so there's no tour.

55:36.765 --> 55:38.562
What about LaVern Baker?

55:38.667 --> 55:40.658
Get LaVern Baker
to take the tour.

55:40.736 --> 55:42.931
She doesn't have a record.
There's nothing to promote.

55:43.005 --> 55:45.166
You and Jesse get up there,
write a couple of songs,

55:45.240 --> 55:46.639
let's get her in the studio.

55:46.709 --> 55:48.404
It's gonna take
a month to do that...

55:48.477 --> 55:50.445
What are we gonna do?
We got to do somethin'.

55:50.512 --> 55:52.173
Ray's got a whole
new band up there.

55:52.247 --> 55:54.579
How the hell did he put
together a band so fast?

55:54.650 --> 55:57.084
Boss! Boss,
they're here.

55:57.152 --> 55:59.950
Come on. Let's get together
so we can show 'em this.

56:00.022 --> 56:01.080
...break this to Ray.

56:01.156 --> 56:03.488
Oh, you're gonna let
me break it to Ray?

56:03.559 --> 56:04.526
Why me?

56:04.593 --> 56:05.958
Because Ruth Brown
was your idea.

56:06.028 --> 56:09.486
Ruth Brown is a good idea,
Ruth Brown was a good idea,
and still is a good idea.

56:09.565 --> 56:10.554
Shh!

56:10.632 --> 56:11.860
# That's good to me #

56:12.601 --> 56:14.125
# Oh, yeah #

56:14.870 --> 56:16.895
# I got a woman #

56:17.740 --> 56:19.469
# Way over town #

56:20.142 --> 56:21.632
# Good to me #

56:22.644 --> 56:24.168
# Whoa, yeah #

56:24.580 --> 56:26.514
# She give me money #

56:27.216 --> 56:29.411
# When I'm in need #

56:29.752 --> 56:31.743
# Yeah, she's the kind of #

56:32.388 --> 56:33.878
# friend indeed #

56:34.656 --> 56:35.953
# I got a woman #

56:36.058 --> 56:37.047
Ahmet.

56:37.292 --> 56:38.350
Yeah.

56:38.427 --> 56:40.292
We gotta get this on wax.

56:40.829 --> 56:41.921
Oh, yeah.

56:42.231 --> 56:43.220
# Oh, yeah #

56:43.399 --> 56:46.835
Hear that, New York?
The sound is huge!

56:46.902 --> 56:49.598
But there's only seven cats
on this record.

56:49.671 --> 56:52.231
This is the new
Ray Charles, baby,

56:52.307 --> 56:54.434
and there's nothing
out there like it!

56:54.510 --> 56:57.411
<i>And you heard it first
on The Moondog Show!</i>

56:59.047 --> 57:00.708
<i># Just for me #</i>

57:01.483 --> 57:02.950
<i># Oh, yeah #</i>

57:03.719 --> 57:05.186
<i># She give me money ##</i>

57:06.255 --> 57:08.917
The Shaw Agency's
the best booker
on the Chitlin' Circuit,

57:08.991 --> 57:10.288
that's my opinion.

57:10.359 --> 57:12.384
Milt Shaw, meet Ray Charles.

57:12.461 --> 57:14.292
Ray, It was
Milt's dad, Billy,

57:14.363 --> 57:16.957
who first drew my attention
to a certain blind pianist

57:17.032 --> 57:19.023
when he was
booking Lowell Fulson.

57:19.101 --> 57:21.535
Ray Charles.
We believe in your talent.

57:21.603 --> 57:24.197
We wanna be
in the Ray Charles business.

57:24.273 --> 57:26.707
We've already got you
booked on a 10-city tour

57:26.775 --> 57:28.265
with Roy Milton's
Solid Senders...

57:28.343 --> 57:29.537
Oh, Roy Milton,
I love him.

57:29.611 --> 57:32.512
...and Tangula
the Exotic Shake Dancer.

57:32.681 --> 57:35.241
She is gorgeous.

57:35.384 --> 57:36.681
Ray,
I gotta tell you,

57:36.752 --> 57:39.243
we think you're onto
something very big here.

57:39.321 --> 57:42.415
Nobody's ever combined
R&B and gospel before.

57:42.491 --> 57:43.890
<i>I've Got A Woman is a smash.</i>

57:43.959 --> 57:46.792
You better start thinking
about a follow-up, my friend.
Right now.

57:46.862 --> 57:49.023
You know, this sounds good.
I gotta run to Texas

57:49.097 --> 57:51.691
and take care
of some business,
and, I'll be right back.

57:51.767 --> 57:54.361
Well, make it fast. I'm ready
to sell, sell, sell.

57:54.436 --> 57:57.701
A- a-as long as you book
me in front of Tangula.

57:57.773 --> 57:59.536
Della, hold on!
Let me get my camera.

57:59.608 --> 58:00.939
Let me get one picture.

58:01.009 --> 58:03.170
Y'all, y'all,
stay right there! Ray!

58:04.146 --> 58:05.773
Della, let me
get one picture!

58:05.848 --> 58:07.873
Come on. One picture, Della!
Come on, now.

58:09.151 --> 58:10.311
Be careful, Ray.

58:10.385 --> 58:12.046
These are your last steps
of freedom, man.

58:12.120 --> 58:13.417
Don't open that door.

58:13.489 --> 58:16.322
Ray, you gotta carry her
over the threshold.

58:23.866 --> 58:26.232
To the right, Ray!
To the right, now!

58:29.371 --> 58:31.134
Ray, you need some help?

58:31.206 --> 58:33.037
You sure you know
what you're doing?

58:33.108 --> 58:35.303
<i># He knows a woman's place #</i>

58:35.377 --> 58:36.935
<i># Right there now,
in her home #</i>

58:37.012 --> 58:38.479
<i># I got a woman ##</i>

58:44.152 --> 58:45.141
Ray.

58:46.955 --> 58:47.944
Ray.

58:49.358 --> 58:51.019
Can I come in?

58:52.294 --> 58:53.852
H- H-Hold on.

58:53.996 --> 58:55.588
What's goin' on, Ray?

58:59.835 --> 59:01.496
Open this door.

59:02.704 --> 59:04.604
Why are you
locking doors
on me, Ray?

59:05.807 --> 59:07.001
You know
the place is small.

59:07.075 --> 59:08.474
We gotta have
a little privacy.

59:08.544 --> 59:10.978
Uh, what we need is
a little more room.

59:11.046 --> 59:14.311
You know, we're gonna
need some space
while we start a family.

59:15.584 --> 59:18.747
Well, Bea, you know
I'm gonna be on the road
for most of the year.

59:18.820 --> 59:19.809
Ray.

59:21.156 --> 59:24.182
I'm just thinking,
what if I'm not
a good father?

59:24.726 --> 59:26.284
My daddy
was never around.

59:26.361 --> 59:28.522
And he had
three different families.

59:30.499 --> 59:31.727
Well,

59:32.834 --> 59:35.997
you are gonna have one,
starting right now.

59:36.071 --> 59:37.060
Right now?

59:37.139 --> 59:38.128
Mmm-hmm.

59:39.007 --> 59:40.406
Well, what do you think?

59:41.610 --> 59:42.577
That's all is
what I know.

59:44.046 --> 59:45.411
<i># I know #</i>

59:45.647 --> 59:47.740
# Hallelujah,
I just love her so #

01:00:07.202 --> 01:00:09.602
# Now, if I call her
on the telephone #

01:00:10.372 --> 01:00:12.397
# And tell her
that I'm all alone #

01:00:13.308 --> 01:00:15.572
# By the time I count
from one to four #

01:00:16.244 --> 01:00:17.268
# I hear her #

01:00:17.646 --> 01:00:18.635
# on my door #

01:00:19.581 --> 01:00:21.572
Stop it!
Y'all done lost your minds!

01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:22.708
Stop all this stuff!

01:00:22.784 --> 01:00:23.842
You need to be saved!

01:00:23.919 --> 01:00:25.250
I can't take it
no more. Stop it!

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:26.378
I can't take it!

01:00:26.455 --> 01:00:28.150
Hold on. Now,
wait a minute, man.

01:00:28.223 --> 01:00:29.588
Take your hands off me!

01:00:29.658 --> 01:00:31.353
This ain't right!

01:00:31.493 --> 01:00:33.893
Just let the people
hear the music.

01:00:34.196 --> 01:00:37.131
Y'all sitting here,
listenin' to this devil!

01:00:37.199 --> 01:00:40.362
You're just givin'
your money to Satan,
that's what you're doin'.

01:00:40.435 --> 01:00:42.403
<i>Hold on,
y- you got a problem?</i>

01:00:42.471 --> 01:00:44.063
Yeah, I got a problem!

01:00:44.139 --> 01:00:45.970
That's gospel
you're singin'!

01:00:46.041 --> 01:00:48.168
You're turning
God's music into sex.

01:00:48.243 --> 01:00:50.234
You're making
money off the Lord!

01:00:50.312 --> 01:00:53.145
Don't y'all smile at me!
All of y'all are in it, too!

01:00:53.215 --> 01:00:55.274
All of y'all are
going straight to hell!

01:00:55.350 --> 01:00:56.374
She's right.

01:00:58.086 --> 01:00:59.246
No, this here's wrong.

01:00:59.321 --> 01:01:00.515
The whole thing's wrong.

01:01:01.723 --> 01:01:03.520
It's okay. It's okay.
Let... let him go.

01:01:04.693 --> 01:01:06.490
You got a right to believe
in what you believe.

01:01:06.561 --> 01:01:08.722
You can go
to hell by yourself!

01:01:08.797 --> 01:01:10.321
Boss, you want
to cancel the show?

01:01:10.399 --> 01:01:11.764
Uh, no. I'm not gonna
cancel the show.

01:01:11.833 --> 01:01:13.391
Just find me
a bari player by tomorrow.

01:01:13.468 --> 01:01:15.834
I just want to ask
the folks right now:

01:01:15.904 --> 01:01:18.896
If all of y'all want me
to keep playing,
let me hear you say "Amen."

01:01:18.974 --> 01:01:20.965
Amen!

01:01:21.043 --> 01:01:22.840
And while you're at it,
find me a girl

01:01:22.911 --> 01:01:24.469
with church-training
that can sing

01:01:24.546 --> 01:01:25.706
but without
the church attitude.

01:01:25.781 --> 01:01:26.839
All right.

01:01:26.915 --> 01:01:29.179
Let's go, y'all.
Keep it going, here we go...

01:01:29.251 --> 01:01:30.411
Come on.

01:01:37.359 --> 01:01:39.384
<i># Let me tell you
'bout a girl I know #</i>

01:01:40.095 --> 01:01:42.620
<i># She is my baby
and she lives next door ##</i>

01:01:47.469 --> 01:01:48.902
Ray, you got your watch?

01:01:48.970 --> 01:01:49.994
Yeah.

01:01:50.072 --> 01:01:53.701
Good. All right, baby,
your blue shirts are on top,

01:01:53.775 --> 01:01:57.211
the pants in between,
and the white shirts are
on the bottom.

01:01:57.612 --> 01:02:00.274
Here's your glasses.
There you go.

01:02:01.950 --> 01:02:02.939
Bea.

01:02:03.418 --> 01:02:05.716
Why don't you come,
go on the road with us?

01:02:05.787 --> 01:02:07.880
Look, baby, what would
I do on the road?

01:02:07.956 --> 01:02:10.322
You'd do what I say
you do, that's what
you're gonna do.

01:02:11.493 --> 01:02:15.259
I've been trying
to get a female voice
in the band, anyway.

01:02:15.330 --> 01:02:18.163
Can't you just
picture me wobbling
around on that stage,

01:02:18.233 --> 01:02:19.461
big as a house?

01:02:19.534 --> 01:02:21.525
Well, I can't picture you,
you know that.

01:02:21.603 --> 01:02:23.093
But I know
what I can do.

01:02:24.773 --> 01:02:27.537
Come on, now.
Don't start nothing
you can't finish.

01:02:27.609 --> 01:02:29.042
Jeff is waiting.

01:02:30.512 --> 01:02:32.707
You know I can't go
on the road with you,

01:02:32.781 --> 01:02:34.271
not with your baby inside me.

01:02:34.349 --> 01:02:35.373
Mmm-hmm.

01:02:35.450 --> 01:02:37.418
I'm gonna get
your shaving kit.

01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:40.251
Uh, Bea,
I... I got it.

01:02:40.889 --> 01:02:42.516
Bea, hold... hold on.

01:02:46.928 --> 01:02:48.486
Bea, let me get it.

01:02:49.531 --> 01:02:52.091
How long you been
hiding this from me?

01:02:53.535 --> 01:02:54.524
Ray!

01:02:55.971 --> 01:02:57.302
I'm your wife!

01:02:57.405 --> 01:02:59.270
Bea, I... I was just so
excited to see you.

01:02:59.341 --> 01:03:01.639
I forgot to leave it
back there with the band,
that's all.

01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:03.041
Let me...
Let me get it.

01:03:03.111 --> 01:03:05.341
Oh, it's just
a little medicine,
that's all, baby.

01:03:05.413 --> 01:03:06.846
That ain't medicine
to nobody, Ray.

01:03:06.915 --> 01:03:08.280
Don't be lyin' to yourself.

01:03:08.350 --> 01:03:09.942
It ain't like I'm
dealing it, baby.

01:03:10.018 --> 01:03:11.508
I just use it
to get a little taste.

01:03:11.586 --> 01:03:13.349
You don't taste poison,
Ray. It kills you.

01:03:13.421 --> 01:03:14.445
Now, you got to stop.

01:03:14.523 --> 01:03:16.684
I ain't got to do
a goddamn thing!

01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:20.888
What about me?
What about your baby?

01:03:21.563 --> 01:03:22.552
Bea.

01:03:22.831 --> 01:03:25.026
It ain't like
I'm new to this.

01:03:25.534 --> 01:03:28.230
If I felt like
this was jeopardizing
my music, or you,

01:03:28.303 --> 01:03:29.702
or providing
for that baby,

01:03:29.771 --> 01:03:31.898
I would stop in a minute.
But I know it won't.

01:03:31.973 --> 01:03:34.498
How do you know that,
Ray? How do...
How do you know that?

01:03:34.576 --> 01:03:37.010
You know what?
You can talk till
you're blue in the face,

01:03:37.078 --> 01:03:38.773
it don't matter.
I'm not gonna stop.

01:03:38.847 --> 01:03:39.836
Then I'm comin'
with you.

01:03:39.915 --> 01:03:40.813
No, no.

01:03:40.882 --> 01:03:41.940
Well, Ray,
you just said...

01:03:42.017 --> 01:03:43.644
No. No.
You know what it is, Bea.

01:03:43.718 --> 01:03:45.618
I... I think
it's like you said.

01:03:46.054 --> 01:03:49.353
I don't think that
the road is a place
for you and the baby.

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:53.791
What are you
saying to me, Ray?

01:03:53.862 --> 01:03:56.057
What I'm sayin' is
that when I get home,

01:03:56.131 --> 01:03:58.463
I hope that you're
here at my house.

01:04:00.235 --> 01:04:01.566
Your house?

01:04:06.141 --> 01:04:07.938
Jeff, come get this bag.

01:04:08.009 --> 01:04:09.533
All right, Ray.

01:04:11.646 --> 01:04:13.136
Hey, Della Bea.

01:04:19.154 --> 01:04:20.485
You all right?

01:04:44.145 --> 01:04:46.773
<i># It brings a tear #</i>

01:04:46.915 --> 01:04:49.475

That's good,
thank you.

01:04:56.524 --> 01:04:57.889
How does she look?

01:04:57.959 --> 01:04:59.586
Very pretty.
Brown skin.

01:04:59.728 --> 01:05:04.188
# I guess I'll drown
in my own tears #

01:05:04.266 --> 01:05:05.665
Yeah, yeah.

01:05:05.734 --> 01:05:08.635
Uh, oh, yeah, that's great.
I really dig your sound.

01:05:08.770 --> 01:05:10.499
Uh, what was
your name again,
sweetheart?

01:05:10.572 --> 01:05:13.132
Oh, Mary Ann.
Mary Ann Fisher.

01:05:13.241 --> 01:05:14.367
Mary Ann Fisher.

01:05:14.442 --> 01:05:15.932
Uh, Mary Ann,
how would you feel

01:05:16.011 --> 01:05:18.445
if I asked you to sing
a torch song
with a gospel feel to it?

01:05:19.648 --> 01:05:22.116
Well, Gospel's all about
love anyway, isn't it?

01:05:22.183 --> 01:05:23.172
Oh, yeah.

01:05:23.251 --> 01:05:26.277
Would it make you
feel like a sinner?

01:05:27.522 --> 01:05:30.082
Well, Mr. Charles,
I love the Lord,
the Lord loves me.

01:05:30.158 --> 01:05:31.625
But I ain't no hypocrite.

01:05:32.994 --> 01:05:36.122
Hello. You know what?
It's hard to fool me,

01:05:36.197 --> 01:05:39.325
but it's impossible
to fool the Almighty,
ain't it?

01:05:39.668 --> 01:05:42.000
Why don't we rehearse
the song a little bit?

01:05:42.070 --> 01:05:43.094
Okay.

01:05:43.171 --> 01:05:45.696
Boss, we got to go.

01:05:45.774 --> 01:05:47.901
Go ahead. I'll be
with you in a minute.

01:05:47.976 --> 01:05:50.171
I just really feel your...
feel your spirit.

01:05:50.245 --> 01:05:51.837
Boss, are you sure?

01:05:55.550 --> 01:05:56.710
Let's go.

01:06:00.322 --> 01:06:02.882
# It brings a tear #

You're amazing.

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:48.592
So are you, baby.
Uh, come sit next to me.

01:06:55.977 --> 01:06:57.638
So, what do you think?

01:07:14.963 --> 01:07:16.487
Ray, telephone.

01:07:16.865 --> 01:07:18.264
Take a message.

01:07:20.035 --> 01:07:21.593
It's Della Bea.

01:07:22.037 --> 01:07:23.527
Damn it.

01:07:23.671 --> 01:07:25.866
Uh, tell her I'm busy.

01:07:26.541 --> 01:07:28.805
Come on, man,
I ain't lying to Bea.

01:07:29.577 --> 01:07:30.942
Uh-oh.

01:07:31.079 --> 01:07:32.273
Is that the wife?

01:07:32.347 --> 01:07:33.712
Shut up.

01:07:36.351 --> 01:07:38.410
I-I'll be there
in a second.

01:07:41.156 --> 01:07:43.056
Don't mess with
this junk, all right?

01:07:43.124 --> 01:07:45.115
All it'll do is
make you sick.

01:07:49.197 --> 01:07:51.791
Does he have all
his fingers and toes?

01:07:52.267 --> 01:07:53.791
Yes, he does.

01:07:58.173 --> 01:07:59.538
Can he, uh...

01:08:03.311 --> 01:08:04.778
Can he see?

01:08:06.481 --> 01:08:07.539
Yes.

01:08:10.585 --> 01:08:12.075
You want to hold him?

01:08:12.153 --> 01:08:13.450
No, I can't.

01:08:13.521 --> 01:08:14.510
Come on, Ray.

01:08:14.589 --> 01:08:16.113
I wouldn't know
what to do it right.

01:08:16.191 --> 01:08:17.818
That's what you
came here for.

01:08:17.892 --> 01:08:20.156
Use this hand
to hold his head.

01:08:21.062 --> 01:08:23.053
Okay. Right there.

01:08:33.207 --> 01:08:34.868
That's your daddy.

01:08:35.176 --> 01:08:36.165
Yeah.

01:08:37.979 --> 01:08:40.880
He ain't no bigger
than a loaf of bread.

01:08:41.582 --> 01:08:42.880
Thank you.

01:08:43.685 --> 01:08:45.845
He's not my gift
to you, Ray.

01:08:46.121 --> 01:08:47.554
He's your son.

01:08:48.756 --> 01:08:51.452
You know I'm gonna take care
of both of you.
You know that, right?

01:08:54.028 --> 01:08:55.518
I love you.

01:08:56.965 --> 01:08:58.660
I love you, too, Ray.

01:08:58.867 --> 01:09:00.892
But there's
something I got to say.

01:09:01.035 --> 01:09:04.129
I know you're a musician,
a working musician,

01:09:04.205 --> 01:09:06.832
but don't bring the road
into our home again.

01:09:06.908 --> 01:09:09.638
The home I'm making
for you and our children.

01:09:09.711 --> 01:09:11.941
Bea, I... I promise
I won't do that.

01:09:12.212 --> 01:09:13.703
It... It's just there's
some things...

01:09:13.781 --> 01:09:15.840
No. Now, don't
say no more.

01:09:16.117 --> 01:09:17.845
I ain't no fool.

01:09:18.486 --> 01:09:20.886
You know, you're
the only woman I'll ever love.

01:09:34.002 --> 01:09:36.663
Mama! Mama, help!

01:09:37.037 --> 01:09:41.600
Mama, help!
Mama, help, please!

01:09:41.910 --> 01:09:43.901
I need you!

01:09:48.649 --> 01:09:51.345
Mama, help!

01:09:52.987 --> 01:09:54.283
Mama!

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:50.193
I hear you, too, Mama.
You're right there.

01:11:57.712 --> 01:11:59.703
Yeah, yes, I am.

01:12:03.051 --> 01:12:04.712
Why are you crying, Mama?

01:12:05.019 --> 01:12:06.213
'Cause I'm happy.

01:12:10.358 --> 01:12:12.189
Hey, it's Uncle Jeff!

Why don't we get
that spot in Memphis, huh?

01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:47.644
We could have our own place.

No need to get sore.

01:14:08.643 --> 01:14:09.974
How about a solo?

You just don't stop,

01:14:12.079 --> 01:14:14.411
Look, I'm going up to New York
to do some publicity.

You take a week off

find some material,

01:14:16.751 --> 01:14:18.844
and when I get back,
we can talk about it.

01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:21.115

You know what I'm sayin',
I've been hearing
this thing in my head,

01:15:00.661 --> 01:15:02.754
kind of like a dance
between a man and three women.

01:15:02.830 --> 01:15:04.661
Sounds fun.
Can I watch?

01:15:04.732 --> 01:15:06.359
It's a dance of voices,
Ahmet.

01:15:06.434 --> 01:15:08.698
W- What do you have in mind?
Like three Mary Anns?

01:15:08.769 --> 01:15:11.237
Oh, no, no, no.
That's too smooth.

01:15:11.305 --> 01:15:13.899

01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:44.624
Where's the key?

01:21:44.698 --> 01:21:45.630
You have to get it.

01:21:45.699 --> 01:21:46.688
I have to find it?

01:21:47.868 --> 01:21:48.960
Is that it?

01:21:49.103 --> 01:21:50.195
It might be.

01:21:51.005 --> 01:21:53.235
I'm not going to
unbuckle your pants yet.

01:21:53.307 --> 01:21:54.865
Let's get you in.

01:22:04.618 --> 01:22:07.109
<i>Miss Mary Ann Fisher,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

01:22:11.292 --> 01:22:13.226
Wait till you see what I got
in the goodie bag.

01:22:13.294 --> 01:22:14.386
Goodie bag?

01:22:14.461 --> 01:22:15.951
Gonna fly you to
the moon, baby.

01:22:16.030 --> 01:22:17.520
Let me get
your hand, Ray.

01:22:17.598 --> 01:22:20.294
There go three.
That's for you.

01:22:21.435 --> 01:22:23.027
I thought you was
my friend, Fathead.

01:22:23.103 --> 01:22:24.400
The weight is off.

01:22:24.972 --> 01:22:26.371
Don't start with me, Ray.

01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:27.498
The weight is off.

01:22:27.574 --> 01:22:28.598
It ain't off.

01:22:28.676 --> 01:22:30.803
When you get high, man,
and you try to cop,

01:22:30.878 --> 01:22:32.436
those dealers spank your ass.

01:22:32.513 --> 01:22:34.037
You gotta have
more discipline.

01:22:34.114 --> 01:22:38.107
You know what, man?
I ain't messing up
my high tonight,

01:22:38.385 --> 01:22:41.047
sitting here with you,
arguing about nothin'.

01:22:42.957 --> 01:22:46.017
Look, Fathead,
just tie me off.

01:22:46.961 --> 01:22:48.360
Come on, Fathead. Fat.

01:22:49.630 --> 01:22:52.963
Take care of
your bad self,
you know so damn much.

01:22:54.301 --> 01:22:55.461
Later, Margie.

01:22:55.869 --> 01:22:57.632
Bye, Fathead.

01:23:00.407 --> 01:23:01.669
Damn.

01:23:06.981 --> 01:23:09.347
Ain't nothing free
in this world but Jesus.

01:23:15.656 --> 01:23:16.680
Hey, Margie.

01:23:16.757 --> 01:23:18.918
Yeah?
What do you want?

01:23:19.326 --> 01:23:21.988
Do me a favor, sweetheart,
and... and pick that up for me.

01:23:22.563 --> 01:23:24.793
You're going to
have to get me off.

01:23:27.301 --> 01:23:29.132
I'll do it,
if you let me try some.

01:23:29.203 --> 01:23:30.295
Shit. No, honey.

01:23:30.371 --> 01:23:32.066
This ain't for
no little girls.

01:23:32.139 --> 01:23:34.073
I ain't no little girl!

01:23:34.608 --> 01:23:36.405
I understand.
It's just that this stuff

01:23:36.477 --> 01:23:39.503
will take you places
that you don't want to go.

01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:41.438
See, I want to share
that with you.

01:23:41.515 --> 01:23:42.880
Listen to me!

01:23:43.017 --> 01:23:44.882
If I ever hear about you
doing some drugs

01:23:44.952 --> 01:23:46.817
you're through, you hear me?

01:23:46.887 --> 01:23:49.219
You believe that
more than you
believe in Jesus!

01:23:50.290 --> 01:23:52.224
Don't say that,
Ray.

01:23:54.628 --> 01:23:55.720
Ray!

01:23:55.796 --> 01:23:58.856
Ray, I watch your show
every single night.

01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:01.961
And every night
is new to me.

01:24:02.102 --> 01:24:04.297
Maybe because
it's new to you.

01:24:04.638 --> 01:24:08.267
It's like you live
every single word

01:24:08.609 --> 01:24:11.601
and then you
bend some crazy note,

01:24:13.113 --> 01:24:15.377
And damn if you
don't break my heart.

01:24:15.516 --> 01:24:17.780
You got genius, baby.

01:24:18.118 --> 01:24:20.609
I just want to
be a part of that.

01:24:20.687 --> 01:24:22.814
Just want to be
a part of that.

01:24:23.157 --> 01:24:25.125
<i># You know the night time,

01:24:25.192 --> 01:24:26.420

Look at him.
Look at his
knees shaking.

01:25:22.783 --> 01:25:24.512
He's got that
junkie itch.

01:25:24.751 --> 01:25:25.843
# Because the night time #

01:25:25.919 --> 01:25:27.580
He's totally hooked.

# Oh, is the right time #

01:25:29.790 --> 01:25:32.088
Yeah, but listen
to that sound.
He's brilliant.

01:25:32.159 --> 01:25:34.184
You can never trust
a junkie, man.

01:25:34.261 --> 01:25:36.627
What do you want me to do?
Listen to him, man.

01:25:36.697 --> 01:25:38.324

Happy birthday!
Happy birthday, Ray!

01:25:52.312 --> 01:25:54.143
You know what to do.

01:25:54.214 --> 01:25:56.614
Take a deep breath.
Go ahead.

01:25:59.186 --> 01:26:00.118
He blow them out?

01:26:00.187 --> 01:26:01.279

<i>You know what,
I... I just want to
thank you so very much.</i>

01:26:21.041 --> 01:26:24.807
<i>Please, uh,
another round of applause
for Miss Margie Hendricks.</i>

01:26:25.712 --> 01:26:28.044
<i>Thank you so much,
and good night.</i>

01:26:29.883 --> 01:26:31.248
Hey, you see
what time it is?

01:26:31.318 --> 01:26:32.342
What's the problem?

01:26:32.419 --> 01:26:34.717
The problem is
on the contract.
That's the problem.

01:26:34.788 --> 01:26:38.121
Ray! Ray! You still
got 20 minutes left.

01:26:38.192 --> 01:26:39.489
Okay, what you want to do?

01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:42.154
That fool's holding us
to every second
of the contract.

01:26:42.229 --> 01:26:44.561
Go... go baby-sit him.
I'll take care of it.

01:26:44.631 --> 01:26:45.893
It's okay.

01:26:45.966 --> 01:26:48.730
<i>You know what, they say
we got a little bit
more work to do.</i>

01:26:48.802 --> 01:26:50.531
That was the last song
in the book, Ray.

01:26:50.604 --> 01:26:52.731
<i>You know, Fathead,
it ain't never the last song.</i>

01:26:52.806 --> 01:26:55.434
<i>Now, band, follow me
and do what I do,
say what I say.</i>

01:26:55.509 --> 01:26:57.067
<i>This is how we gonna do it.</i>

01:27:31.812 --> 01:27:34.246
# Hey mama,
don't you treat me wrong #

01:27:34.314 --> 01:27:36.748
# Come and love your daddy
all night long #

01:27:36.883 --> 01:27:39.681
# It's all right #

01:27:40.420 --> 01:27:42.445
# Whoa, it's all right #

01:27:42.522 --> 01:27:44.752
# Hey, hey, hey, yeah #

01:27:47.261 --> 01:27:49.456
# See the girl
with the diamond ring #

01:27:49.963 --> 01:27:52.124
# She knows how to
shake that thing #

01:27:55.769 --> 01:27:57.896
# Whoa, it's all right #

01:27:57.971 --> 01:27:59.768
# Hey, hey, hey, yeah #

01:28:08.749 --> 01:28:10.808
That's what I'm talking about.

01:28:18.191 --> 01:28:20.523
# Tell your mama,
tell your pa #

01:28:20.994 --> 01:28:23.224
# I'm gonna send you back
to Arkansas #

01:28:24.531 --> 01:28:26.226
# Oh yes, ma'am,
you don't do right #

01:28:26.833 --> 01:28:28.733
# Don't do right #

01:28:32.673 --> 01:28:34.140
# What'd I say? #

01:28:35.108 --> 01:28:36.666
# Tell me what'd I say #

01:28:37.611 --> 01:28:39.704
# Tell me what'd I say #

01:28:39.780 --> 01:28:41.475
Where can I get
that record from?

01:28:41.548 --> 01:28:43.516
I don't know.
It doesn't exist yet.

01:28:43.583 --> 01:28:45.380
I'll tell Ray
he should record it.

01:28:46.086 --> 01:28:47.348
# Oh, no #

01:28:48.755 --> 01:28:49.847
# Mmm #

01:28:50.157 --> 01:28:51.488
# Mmm #

01:28:51.558 --> 01:28:52.752
# Ooh #

01:28:52.826 --> 01:28:54.157
# Ooh #

01:28:54.227 --> 01:28:55.251
# Eee #
# Eee #

01:28:55.329 --> 01:28:56.694
# Ooh #
# Ooh #

01:28:59.599 --> 01:29:00.623
# It's all right #

01:29:00.701 --> 01:29:02.225
# Baby, it's all right #

01:29:02.302 --> 01:29:03.735
# Baby, it's all right #

01:29:03.804 --> 01:29:06.102
# Oh, it's all right #
# Baby, it's all right #

01:29:06.173 --> 01:29:07.663
# Mama, it's all right #

01:29:07.741 --> 01:29:09.140
# Baby, it's all right #

01:29:09.209 --> 01:29:10.198
# It's all right #

01:29:10.277 --> 01:29:11.266
# It's all right #

01:29:11.345 --> 01:29:13.336
# It's all right, now ##

01:29:15.549 --> 01:29:17.210
Yeah, that's it.

01:29:19.419 --> 01:29:20.408
Oh, this is it.

01:29:23.290 --> 01:29:26.282
I'm telling you,
that is out of sight.
That's a hit.

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:29.586
It's fantastic, Ray.
But what the hell are we
gonna do with this?

01:29:29.663 --> 01:29:30.630
It's too damn long.

01:29:30.697 --> 01:29:33.666
Every night we play this, man,
we bring the house down.

01:29:33.734 --> 01:29:34.860
I'm telling you,
it's guaranteed.

01:29:34.935 --> 01:29:36.732
Tom, cut the playback!

01:29:37.003 --> 01:29:38.334
Come on out here.

01:29:38.505 --> 01:29:39.836
<i># Baby, it's all right ##</i>

01:29:40.474 --> 01:29:42.271
You know what, Ray,
you're probably right.

01:29:42.342 --> 01:29:43.536
I mean,
I'm sure you're right.

01:29:43.610 --> 01:29:45.407
I've never heard
a sound like this before.

01:29:45.479 --> 01:29:47.276
But how the hell are
we gonna market this?

01:29:47.347 --> 01:29:50.043
We could cut the second verse,
pop back into the chorus.

01:29:50.117 --> 01:29:52.381
Man, you cut that,
I'll cut you in half.

01:29:52.786 --> 01:29:54.947
All right, all right,
Ray. Ahem.

01:29:55.088 --> 01:29:57.682
We could, uh,
split it up.

01:29:57.758 --> 01:30:00.226
<i>Do a Side AISide B
type of thing.</i>

01:30:00.293 --> 01:30:02.227
It's been done before.
What the hell, right?

01:30:02.295 --> 01:30:03.284
Yeah.

01:30:04.798 --> 01:30:06.390
It's s-sexual.

01:30:06.466 --> 01:30:08.400
It's just too
damn sexual for kids.

01:30:08.468 --> 01:30:09.730
Let's do it.

01:30:09.803 --> 01:30:11.828
Yeah, baby!
That's why
I love y'all, man.

01:30:11.905 --> 01:30:14.237
All right. What the hell?
It's Atlantic, right?

01:30:14.307 --> 01:30:15.274
Atlantic!

01:30:15.342 --> 01:30:16.536
We'll release it
in the summer.

01:30:16.610 --> 01:30:18.237
There's less censorship,
school's out.

01:30:18.311 --> 01:30:20.006
The kids are ready
to kick loose.

01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:21.843
Ha, okay!

01:30:23.917 --> 01:30:27.250
Tom, let's see
if we can cut
this pumpkin in two.

01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:29.220
Show me what your
genius is all about.

01:30:29.289 --> 01:30:30.551
You got it, boss.

01:30:30.991 --> 01:30:34.392
Yeah, that is it.
You put one on Side A,
put another on Side B.

01:30:34.461 --> 01:30:35.792
Man, that sounds
out of sight.

01:30:35.862 --> 01:30:36.954
How you feeling, Ray?

01:30:37.030 --> 01:30:38.520
I feel groovy, baby.

01:30:38.999 --> 01:30:41.331
I'm talking about the junk.
What?

01:30:41.601 --> 01:30:43.364
It's starting
to show.

01:30:44.137 --> 01:30:45.661
You're scratching
all the time.

01:30:45.739 --> 01:30:46.967
You can't sit still.

01:30:47.808 --> 01:30:50.072
Hey, man, have I ever
missed a date?

01:30:50.143 --> 01:30:51.872
No, you never have.

01:30:51.945 --> 01:30:54.243
Who's the one
who delivers a record
in one take, hmm?

01:30:54.314 --> 01:30:56.544
Ray, you deliver better
than anybody I know

01:30:56.616 --> 01:30:59.050
but I'm not talking to you
as a businessman.

01:30:59.119 --> 01:31:01.144
Now come on,
listen to me.

01:31:01.988 --> 01:31:03.819
I'm worried about you.

01:31:04.524 --> 01:31:07.755
As a friend,
I'm telling you, man,
your slip is hanging.

01:31:08.895 --> 01:31:10.294
"Your slip is hanging."

01:31:10.363 --> 01:31:13.821
You been hanging out
with us country boys
too much, man.

01:31:13.900 --> 01:31:17.336
Uh, don't worry about this,
man. If this monkey gets
too heavy on my back,

01:31:17.404 --> 01:31:20.134
I'll get an organ grinder,
man, and put him to work.

<i>Down Beat voted him
Best Male Jazz Vocalist

01:31:30.951 --> 01:31:32.816
Well, if you want to keep him
in Philadelphia,

01:31:32.886 --> 01:31:34.615
you're going to find him
a bigger venue.

That ain't
no coconut tree, Della.
That's a palm tree.

01:32:50.530 --> 01:32:51.554
There's thousands
of them.

01:32:52.632 --> 01:32:53.621
Okay.

01:32:53.733 --> 01:32:55.963
Here's the keys
to your life,
a brand-new life.

01:32:58.672 --> 01:33:00.299
Oh, Ray.

01:33:03.443 --> 01:33:05.434
Ray, this is too much.

01:33:05.712 --> 01:33:07.703
Have you seen
the dining room?

01:33:10.850 --> 01:33:12.784
But, baby,
it's October.

01:33:12.886 --> 01:33:14.786
But you know what,
I wanted to
celebrate early,

01:33:14.854 --> 01:33:17.482
because the band
is gonna be playing
during the holidays.

01:33:19.659 --> 01:33:21.024
You are unbelievable.

01:33:21.094 --> 01:33:22.152
Look at your presents.

01:33:22.262 --> 01:33:24.059
Baby, look at what
Santa brought you.

01:33:24.130 --> 01:33:25.324
You must have been good.

01:33:25.398 --> 01:33:27.764
Go ahead!
Christmas is early,
baby!

01:33:27.834 --> 01:33:28.994
Go get it.

01:33:29.169 --> 01:33:30.295
What's he taken?
A guitar.

01:33:30.370 --> 01:33:32.065
A musician just
like your daddy.

01:33:32.138 --> 01:33:33.196
Can you play?

01:33:35.175 --> 01:33:36.107
Hello?

01:33:36.176 --> 01:33:37.666
What else you got?

01:33:37.811 --> 01:33:38.869
What's that?

01:33:38.945 --> 01:33:40.037
How'd you get this number?

01:33:41.147 --> 01:33:42.671
How do you think I got it?

01:33:42.816 --> 01:33:44.340
Put Ray on the phone.

01:33:46.019 --> 01:33:48.510
Ray, telephone.

01:33:48.855 --> 01:33:50.152
Deal with it, man.

01:33:50.223 --> 01:33:52.885
Ray, it's important.
Telephone.

01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:54.827
I-I'll be right back.

01:33:54.894 --> 01:33:56.122

It's Margie, man.

01:34:04.404 --> 01:34:07.396
Junior, come... come
and help your mama
change your brother's diaper.

01:34:07.507 --> 01:34:08.906
I don't want to go.

01:34:08.975 --> 01:34:10.499

open my presents.

All right, come on!
I don't want to go.

01:34:12.245 --> 01:34:14.076

<i>Hello.
Hey, baby.</i>

01:34:16.149 --> 01:34:19.516

Surprise me?
Are you out of your mind?

01:34:21.221 --> 01:34:22.586
I'm with my wife
and my kids.

01:34:22.656 --> 01:34:25.022
Well, on the road,
I'm Mrs. Ray Charles.

01:34:25.091 --> 01:34:26.217
That's on the road.

01:34:26.359 --> 01:34:29.851
Yeah, but, baby, come on,
I got everything
set up for us.

01:34:30.263 --> 01:34:32.094
Did you hear what
I just said to you, huh?

01:34:32.198 --> 01:34:34.860
Oh, wait a minute,
baby, look,
I got a bottle of Bols, and...

01:34:34.934 --> 01:34:37.903
Shut up. Shut up.
Listen, we record in
two weeks, okay?

01:34:37.971 --> 01:34:38.938
I'll see you then.

01:34:39.005 --> 01:34:40.973
<i>Wait a minute, Ray!
Bye.</i>

Cut, cut, cut.
You know, y'all know
that sounds off.

01:35:26.953 --> 01:35:29.353
Ahem, you know what,
the three-part harmony is off.

01:35:29.489 --> 01:35:32.287
Let's start it
all over again, uh,
from the top with the band.

<i>I knew you'd like that,

<i>We can record
each part separately.</i>

01:35:44.104 --> 01:35:46.834
Whoa, Nellie! You know,
I can't wait to see that.

01:35:48.007 --> 01:35:49.565
What's so funny?

01:35:49.642 --> 01:35:51.075
Nothing, "pardner."

01:35:52.612 --> 01:35:54.011
Margie's drunk. Jeff?

01:35:55.782 --> 01:35:57.249
You should go home
and sleep it off.

01:35:57.317 --> 01:35:59.285
Margie, come on now,
let me take you home.

01:35:59.352 --> 01:36:01.445
No! I'll leave when I'm good
and goddamn ready!

01:36:01.521 --> 01:36:03.148
She's good and goddamn
ready right now.

01:36:03.223 --> 01:36:05.453
Why don't you make me
leave this, sucker!

01:36:05.525 --> 01:36:07.959
Teach you to treat me
like some piece of meat!

01:36:08.595 --> 01:36:09.994
I ain't shutting up!

01:36:10.063 --> 01:36:11.724
Should we get in there?
No.

01:36:11.798 --> 01:36:13.163
Get them all out, right now.

01:36:13.233 --> 01:36:14.495
You'll have to make me leave!

01:36:14.567 --> 01:36:17.400
You know what, Jeff?
Get all of them out of here.

01:36:17.537 --> 01:36:19.596
You're a cold-ass bastard!

01:36:19.672 --> 01:36:20.866
Let go of me, Jeff!

01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:22.771
You're a cold-ass bastard,
Ray!

01:36:22.842 --> 01:36:26.369
See, he wouldn't spit on me
if my ass was on fire!

01:36:26.446 --> 01:36:27.538
Damn right I wouldn't.

01:36:27.614 --> 01:36:29.673
Put me down, Jeff!
Put me down! Damn it!

01:36:30.016 --> 01:36:31.313
You dropped your shoe.

01:36:33.353 --> 01:36:35.753
All right, come on,
let's get back to work.

01:36:35.822 --> 01:36:37.619
Tom, this is
what I want you to do.

01:36:37.690 --> 01:36:40.181
We'll lay my vocals down
and finish the harmony parts.

01:36:40.260 --> 01:36:42.751
<i>Uh, how're we gonna do
the harmonies, Ray?</i>

01:36:42.829 --> 01:36:43.887
<i>You sent the girls home.</i>

01:36:43.963 --> 01:36:46.329
I know what I did
with the girls.
Let me take care of that.

01:36:46.399 --> 01:36:49.368
You just turn that
eight-track on, and I'll do
the girls' parts myself.

01:36:49.435 --> 01:36:52.336
And go out here
somewhere and find me
an "Oh, Johnny" girl.

01:36:52.705 --> 01:36:54.332
<i>Uh, one minute.</i>

01:36:55.341 --> 01:36:56.933
What the hell's
an "Oh, Johnny" girl?

01:36:57.076 --> 01:36:58.668
I think I've got an idea.

01:36:59.179 --> 01:37:02.945
<i># Last night

01:37:03.016 --> 01:37:05.814

<i># Oh, Johnny! #</i>

<i>The sky's the limit, Ray.</i>

01:37:29.909 --> 01:37:31.934
<i>I got you
a $5,000-a-night raise.</i>

01:37:32.178 --> 01:37:34.043
They're gonna up you
to 15 per.

01:37:34.180 --> 01:37:35.613
Rehearsal in
10 minutes.

01:37:35.682 --> 01:37:37.445
Jeff, could you get
me some cigarettes?

01:37:38.084 --> 01:37:39.415
Okay, boss.

01:37:41.855 --> 01:37:43.288
15 per, huh?

01:37:43.356 --> 01:37:47.520
You know, Ray,
your contract with Atlantic
is expiring in four months.

01:37:47.861 --> 01:37:48.885
Yeah.

01:37:48.962 --> 01:37:50.896
Yeah, I've got
the contract with me.

01:37:51.030 --> 01:37:52.964
They're going to
double my royalties.

01:37:53.032 --> 01:37:54.966
Before we jump back
in that pond,

01:37:55.101 --> 01:37:57.296
I thought I'd find out
what else was out there.

01:37:57.370 --> 01:38:00.999
I had a very productive chat
with ABC-Paramount yesterday.

01:38:01.107 --> 01:38:03.041
ABC? Who told you
to do that, huh?

01:38:03.109 --> 01:38:06.101
And you know,
Atlantic is family,
just like the Shaw Agency.

01:38:06.179 --> 01:38:08.613
Ray, my job is to get you
the best deal possible.

01:38:09.282 --> 01:38:11.250
ABC is very interested.

01:38:11.317 --> 01:38:12.341
No.

01:38:14.988 --> 01:38:16.319
How interested?

01:38:17.190 --> 01:38:22.093
How about
a $50,000 advance
each year for three years?

01:38:22.161 --> 01:38:24.254
You produce
your own records.

01:38:24.631 --> 01:38:27.156
They'll deduct recording costs
and give you

01:38:27.533 --> 01:38:29.194
75 percent.

01:38:32.872 --> 01:38:35.670
Ahmet and Jerry are
flying in tonight,

01:38:36.009 --> 01:38:39.570
so will you put them off
until I can talk
things out with ABC?

01:38:41.681 --> 01:38:44.172
Well, my mama said,
ain't nothing wrong
with talking.

01:38:45.285 --> 01:38:46.309
Hey, enough of
the formalities.

01:38:46.386 --> 01:38:48.320
Come on, let's go back
into the office, Ray.

01:38:48.388 --> 01:38:49.446
I hope I can call you Ray.

01:38:49.522 --> 01:38:50.989
I want you to be
comfortable here.

01:38:51.057 --> 01:38:54.117
Because I'll tell you
something, everything is
gonna be better at ABC.

01:38:54.193 --> 01:38:56.093
Moving from an indie label
to a major

01:38:56.162 --> 01:38:57.789
means you can sell
a lot more records,

01:38:57.864 --> 01:39:01.163
as well as attract
much larger crowds,
both white and Negro.

01:39:01.234 --> 01:39:04.829
Yeah, but Mr. Clark,
you know, I've been
at Atlantic for so long,

01:39:05.338 --> 01:39:09.638
I just want to give
those guys a chance, you know,
to at least match the offer.

01:39:09.709 --> 01:39:11.973
Mm-hmm.
Oh, certainly, certainly.

01:39:12.078 --> 01:39:13.568
But, uh, I doubt
they'll be able to.

01:39:13.646 --> 01:39:15.637
We're giving you
a state-of-the-art deal here.

01:39:15.715 --> 01:39:19.082
Well, you know, since I'm
producing my own records,
I was wondering if I could

01:39:19.152 --> 01:39:20.983
uh, own my masters, too.

01:39:28.528 --> 01:39:29.552
Well,

01:39:29.629 --> 01:39:31.859
Ray, we've... we've never
done that before.

01:39:31.931 --> 01:39:33.956
No record company has.

01:39:34.100 --> 01:39:38.799
Well, I think I'm going to
have to have it that way for
me to leave Atlantic Records.

01:39:47.647 --> 01:39:49.979
Ahmet believes
we're family here at Atlantic.

01:39:50.049 --> 01:39:52.108
I believe we're family
here at Atlantic.

01:39:52.185 --> 01:39:54.016
Obviously, you don't!

01:39:54.487 --> 01:39:56.045
Ahmet wouldn't believe it.

01:39:56.122 --> 01:39:57.680
You know what he said, Ray?

01:39:57.757 --> 01:39:59.725
He said you would never
turn your back on us.

01:39:59.792 --> 01:40:01.919
Never for a schlockmeister
like Sam Clark!

01:40:03.096 --> 01:40:05.155
That's rich.
Sam Clark's a corporate slug,

01:40:05.231 --> 01:40:08.428
who wouldn't know
the difference between
Earl Hines and Art Tatum!

01:40:14.741 --> 01:40:16.800
We let you grow here, Ray.

01:40:17.110 --> 01:40:20.773
And nobody's taking
credit for your talent,
but we nourished it.

01:40:21.247 --> 01:40:23.238
We let you do your thing.

01:40:24.817 --> 01:40:27.012
God damn it!
We deserve better than this.

01:40:27.086 --> 01:40:29.145
You know what,
don't think that
I don't appreciate

01:40:29.222 --> 01:40:31.019
everything you guys
have done here, Jerry.

01:40:31.090 --> 01:40:33.718
Ahmet, I'm very
proud of the work that
we've done here together.

01:40:33.793 --> 01:40:37.024
But, Atlantic has done
pretty good money-wise
on my records, haven't they?

01:40:37.096 --> 01:40:38.529
Yes, we've done
very well, Ray.

01:40:38.598 --> 01:40:41.829
You... you were the ones that
taught me that making a record
is business,

01:40:41.901 --> 01:40:44.267
and find the best
business deal you can.

01:40:44.337 --> 01:40:47.602
Now, 75 cents of every dollar,
and owning my own masters

01:40:47.673 --> 01:40:49.800
is a pretty damn
good deal.

01:40:50.343 --> 01:40:51.970
Can you match it?

01:40:52.945 --> 01:40:57.041
Ray, we would love to
match it, but we just can't.

01:40:58.384 --> 01:41:01.217
That's a better deal
than Sinatra gets.

01:41:04.123 --> 01:41:05.590
I'm very proud of you.

01:41:08.094 --> 01:41:11.689
Looks like those boys
are going to get
a taste of country dumb.

01:41:11.764 --> 01:41:12.924
Yeah.

01:41:15.868 --> 01:41:17.199
He'll be all right, man.

01:41:18.371 --> 01:41:20.271
You guys
always do find the best.

01:41:37.523 --> 01:41:39.013
# Georgia #

01:41:41.394 --> 01:41:43.487
# Georgia #

01:41:45.264 --> 01:41:48.097
# The whole day through #

01:41:48.267 --> 01:41:51.065
# The whole day through #

01:41:51.137 --> 01:41:53.264
# Just an old sweet song #

01:41:56.109 --> 01:41:59.567
# Keeps Georgia on my mind #

01:41:59.645 --> 01:42:04.275
# Georgia on my mind #

01:42:05.418 --> 01:42:07.716
# I said Georgia #

01:42:11.324 --> 01:42:13.656
# Georgia #

01:42:13.726 --> 01:42:15.523
Listen to that crap.

01:42:16.762 --> 01:42:20.095
Thought you said that
ABC wasn't going to
force nothing on him.

01:42:20.333 --> 01:42:21.800
They didn't.

01:42:22.468 --> 01:42:24.163
It was Ray's idea.

01:42:26.272 --> 01:42:27.330
Something new.

01:42:27.406 --> 01:42:29.966
What are we then, Jeff?
Something old?

01:42:30.042 --> 01:42:33.705
Yeah, what about us?
We got to eat, too.

01:42:37.817 --> 01:42:42.754
# Other arms should
reach out to me #

01:42:45.191 --> 01:42:50.128
# Other eyes smile tenderly #

01:42:52.365 --> 01:42:57.325
# Still in the peaceful dreams
I see #

01:42:58.037 --> 01:43:02.736
# The road leads back
to you ##

01:43:10.783 --> 01:43:11.807
<i>It's a hit record.</i>

01:43:11.884 --> 01:43:13.442
<i>What the hell
is wrong with that?</i>

01:43:13.519 --> 01:43:16.079
Critics say you've gone
middle-of-the-road.

01:43:16.155 --> 01:43:19.249
<i>The orchestra, the choir,
The Perry Como Show, man?</i>

01:43:19.325 --> 01:43:22.852
If I feel the music,
that means it's real.

01:43:22.929 --> 01:43:25.591
No, it ain't.
Ray Charles is a sellout.

01:43:25.665 --> 01:43:28.657
The blind Liberace,
leaving those Rocking
Chair roots behind.

01:43:28.734 --> 01:43:29.723
Quincy Jones.

01:43:29.802 --> 01:43:31.667
Can we get a picture
of these two guys?

01:43:31.737 --> 01:43:33.602
Six-nine!
Hey, boy.

01:43:33.673 --> 01:43:36.107
Look, here, uh,
this interview is over.

01:43:36.175 --> 01:43:38.040
I'd love to
get you two together, man.

01:43:38.110 --> 01:43:39.509
S- some other time.

01:43:39.845 --> 01:43:42.473
Look at you.
How's it going, man?
You look good.

01:43:42.548 --> 01:43:44.607
Let me look at you.
You look good, too.

01:43:44.684 --> 01:43:46.345
You hear what they're
saying about me?

01:43:46.419 --> 01:43:49.513
I just said that I... I
can't do it no more.
I've gone middle-of-the-road.

01:43:49.589 --> 01:43:51.022
So crank out
another hit.

01:43:51.090 --> 01:43:52.216
Let me tell you something,

01:43:52.291 --> 01:43:54.725
it ain't easy
to keep on being greezy, kid.

01:43:55.194 --> 01:43:56.627
Where you blow in from?

01:43:57.830 --> 01:43:58.888
Paris.

01:43:58.965 --> 01:44:00.091
<i>Bonjour.</i>

01:44:00.166 --> 01:44:02.361
Yeah, man.
France is where it's at.

01:44:02.535 --> 01:44:04.628
Yeah, man. And all that stuff
you've been playing,

01:44:04.704 --> 01:44:07.104
man, it's just...
it really feels out of sight.

01:44:07.173 --> 01:44:09.664
You know, we gotta
record something together.

01:44:09.742 --> 01:44:11.505
I mean, people will
really dig it.

01:44:11.577 --> 01:44:13.442
So, where you going
after the Festival?

01:44:13.512 --> 01:44:17.312
Oh, I... I go to D.C., Richmond,
uh, Virginia, Georgia.

01:44:17.383 --> 01:44:20.250
You know what, once you
get the record out there,
you gotta sell it.

01:44:20.319 --> 01:44:21.752
The South, man?

01:44:22.955 --> 01:44:24.252
I'm not doing that no more.

01:44:24.323 --> 01:44:27.156
Hey, come on, kid,
that's where
the money is, baby.

01:44:27.226 --> 01:44:29.751
You know, When I left Seattle
with Hamp,

01:44:29.829 --> 01:44:31.057
we went down there, man.

01:44:31.130 --> 01:44:33.724
And it felt like
I walked into a prison cell.

01:44:33.799 --> 01:44:37.428
You know, a black man
is a "boy"
in Mississippi, Ray.

01:44:37.503 --> 01:44:39.437
Even if he's 80 years old.

01:44:42.675 --> 01:44:45.109
I'm never playing
to Jim Crow again. Ever.

01:44:45.177 --> 01:44:47.008
If that's what you feel,
baby.

01:44:47.079 --> 01:44:50.742
I'm serious, Ray.
Man, we gotta do something.

01:44:52.451 --> 01:44:54.351
Well, you know,
what... what the hell, man.

01:44:54.420 --> 01:44:57.787
You're just going
to leave a lot more money
on the table for me.

01:44:58.324 --> 01:44:59.985
You're welcome to it,
man.

01:45:15.107 --> 01:45:16.665
You ready to work?

01:45:16.742 --> 01:45:18.039
Work on what?

01:45:19.245 --> 01:45:21.110
Get over here, you gotta
help me with this.

01:45:21.180 --> 01:45:22.613
Percy just sent me
some new music.

01:45:36.662 --> 01:45:38.926
You know what
they're saying about me?

01:45:38.998 --> 01:45:41.432
Said I've lost something,
said I've gone
middle-of-the-road.

01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:43.764
They may as well say
the same thing about you.

01:45:43.836 --> 01:45:45.167
You were the soul
of this band.

01:45:45.237 --> 01:45:47.671
Now every time you're around,
you're just drunk.

01:45:49.675 --> 01:45:51.199
Drunk soul
of a blind junkie.

01:45:51.277 --> 01:45:53.006
What a lovely couple.

01:45:53.079 --> 01:45:55.479
Why don't you
just get out of here?

01:45:57.316 --> 01:45:59.307
I ain't drunk, Ray.

01:46:00.252 --> 01:46:01.583
I'm pregnant.

01:46:02.755 --> 01:46:05.519
Yeah, that's right.
I'm having your baby.

01:46:05.591 --> 01:46:08.389
You ain't really...
You... you can't do that.

01:46:08.861 --> 01:46:10.522
I'm gonna have to
talk to the doctor.

01:46:10.596 --> 01:46:11.756
You gotta get rid of it.

01:46:13.165 --> 01:46:14.996
My God!

01:46:15.134 --> 01:46:17.295
What, because
I'm not your precious Bea?

01:46:17.870 --> 01:46:20.065
I'm not good enough
to have this baby?

01:46:21.273 --> 01:46:23.833
You lay up
in my bed every night.

01:46:23.909 --> 01:46:25.137
My bed!

01:46:26.278 --> 01:46:27.939
I'm gonna have this baby, Ray.

01:46:31.150 --> 01:46:33.516
No, Ray! No!
Come on, come on.
Come on, just listen.

01:46:33.586 --> 01:46:34.575
Just listen to me.

01:46:34.653 --> 01:46:35.984
You know
I care about you, baby.

01:46:36.055 --> 01:46:38.387
I won't let
nothing happen to you.
I'll pay for everything.

01:46:38.457 --> 01:46:39.515
No!

01:46:39.592 --> 01:46:41.753
It's gonna cost you
more than money.

01:46:41.827 --> 01:46:44.819
I want you to leave her, Ray.
Come and be with our baby.

01:46:44.897 --> 01:46:48.389
You out of your damn mind.
You knew the rules
when you got into this.

01:46:48.467 --> 01:46:50.833
You know goddamn well
I ain't gonna
leave my family.

01:46:52.238 --> 01:46:53.899
Leave your family?

01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:56.765
You are a damn fool,
you know that?

01:46:57.510 --> 01:47:00.843
Between the dope
and the music and me,

01:47:00.913 --> 01:47:03.575
you already done left
your damn family!

01:47:04.083 --> 01:47:07.985
You know what
the sad part about it is,
Ray, you don't even know it.

01:47:12.892 --> 01:47:14.382
You know what?

01:47:14.460 --> 01:47:17.987
From now on, it's strictly
business between you and me.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.764
Yeah, that's it. That's it.
Keep that anger.

01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:26.131
# Hit the road, Jack #

01:47:26.205 --> 01:47:27.763

# You ain't got no money,

# Well, I guess
if you say so #

01:48:10.416 --> 01:48:12.611
# I'd have to pack my things
and go #

01:48:24.330 --> 01:48:25.991
Hey, Ray, it's Sam.

01:48:26.499 --> 01:48:28.899
Can you hear me? It's Sam!

01:48:29.034 --> 01:48:31.662
<i>Yeah, hey, Hit the Road
is our second number one.</i>

01:48:31.737 --> 01:48:34.900
Yeah. ABC is taking out ads
in all the trades.

01:48:35.307 --> 01:48:37.798
Yeah, oh, and congrats
on your Grammy nomination.

01:48:38.277 --> 01:48:40.939
No, no, no I know
you're going to win.

01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:43.341
Hey, you feeling all right?

01:48:43.816 --> 01:48:46.410
Well, come on, baby,
be happy.
You're doing good.

01:48:46.652 --> 01:48:47.744
Thank you, Sam.

01:48:48.954 --> 01:48:50.751
I really am happy about that.

01:48:51.290 --> 01:48:52.814
Yeah.

01:48:56.395 --> 01:48:59.796
I'll stop by Jeff's room
and get my money
on my way out.

01:49:06.805 --> 01:49:07.794
Ray.

01:49:09.542 --> 01:49:11.407
Margie, you ain't gotta leave,
baby.

01:49:11.577 --> 01:49:13.568
I'm on your hit record.

01:49:13.712 --> 01:49:16.545
If I'm ever going to go solo,
then now's the time.

01:49:16.615 --> 01:49:18.412
Yeah, I... I don't want you...

01:49:18.551 --> 01:49:20.348
I don't want you to go solo.

01:49:20.419 --> 01:49:22.910
Ray, for once,
I'm doing something for me.

01:49:23.956 --> 01:49:26.390
You remember the hummingbird,
right?

01:49:27.192 --> 01:49:28.181
What?

01:49:28.861 --> 01:49:30.624
The hummingbird, Bea.

01:49:43.542 --> 01:49:45.703
And I don't want you to go.

01:49:59.024 --> 01:50:00.457
Somebody will fetch you

01:50:00.526 --> 01:50:02.050
when your bus
gets to St. Augustine.

01:50:02.127 --> 01:50:04.254
And when you get there,
show them this sign,

01:50:04.330 --> 01:50:06.696
and tell them you're name is
Ray Charles Robinson.

01:50:07.633 --> 01:50:10.568
And them sandwiches I made,
don't eat 'em all at once.
You hear?

01:50:10.636 --> 01:50:12.866
Oh, please,
don't make me go away.

01:50:12.938 --> 01:50:14.565
I'll keep up
with the normal kids.

01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:16.631
I'll be good,
just like George.

01:50:16.709 --> 01:50:18.677
This ain't got nothing
to do with George.

01:50:18.744 --> 01:50:21.212
I've taken you
as far as I can, baby.

01:50:21.347 --> 01:50:24.612
Them teachers
at that blind school, they can
teach you things I can't.

01:50:24.683 --> 01:50:26.412
And you need an education
in this world.

01:50:26.485 --> 01:50:27.679
I don't want
no education!

01:50:27.753 --> 01:50:28.742
Don't say that!

01:50:28.821 --> 01:50:30.755
I don't!
I want to stay with you!

01:50:30.823 --> 01:50:31.847
Stop it, Ray!

01:50:31.924 --> 01:50:34.586
I won't have you living
hand-to-mouth like me,
you hear?

01:50:35.461 --> 01:50:38.897
Now listen, if you
want to do something
to make your mama proud,

01:50:39.164 --> 01:50:42.964
promise me, promise me
you'll never let nobody
turn you into no cripple.

01:50:43.068 --> 01:50:44.763
You won't become
no charity case.

01:50:44.837 --> 01:50:46.771
You'll stand on
your own two feet.

01:50:46.839 --> 01:50:48.170
I promise.

01:50:48.507 --> 01:50:49.997
I love you, baby.

01:50:51.010 --> 01:50:52.500
I'm so proud of you.

01:51:07.393 --> 01:51:08.621
<i>No more segregation!</i>

01:51:08.694 --> 01:51:11.720
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

01:51:11.797 --> 01:51:14.891
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

01:51:18.837 --> 01:51:21.635
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

01:51:21.707 --> 01:51:24.733
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

01:51:24.810 --> 01:51:27.836
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

01:51:27.913 --> 01:51:29.676
Welcome back to Augusta, Ray!

01:51:29.748 --> 01:51:31.477
Hey, good to see you.

01:51:31.784 --> 01:51:34.719
No more segregation!
No more segregation!

01:51:34.787 --> 01:51:36.584
Do you believe
in the protest, Ray?

01:51:36.889 --> 01:51:38.288
Get out of here!

01:51:38.357 --> 01:51:40.917
Ray, I'm sorry about this.
Hurry on up inside.

01:51:40.993 --> 01:51:42.756
We got refreshments
waiting.

01:51:42.828 --> 01:51:44.455
Mr. Charles!
Mr. Charles!

01:51:44.530 --> 01:51:46.259
You know tonight's show
is segregated?

01:51:46.331 --> 01:51:47.958
The dance floor
is whites only.

01:51:48.033 --> 01:51:49.466
Negroes can't leave
the balcony.

01:51:49.535 --> 01:51:51.628
That's how it is, man.
You know, this is Georgia.

01:51:51.704 --> 01:51:53.001
You think we don't know that?

01:51:53.072 --> 01:51:55.438
Negroes are persecuted
in this state every day!

01:51:55.507 --> 01:51:57.441
Ain't nothing
I can do about that.

01:51:57.509 --> 01:52:00.603
I'm an entertainer.
And... and we all gotta
play Jim Crow down here.

01:52:00.679 --> 01:52:02.442
I'm sorry, man.
Now get out of here, boy.

01:52:02.514 --> 01:52:03.845
It doesn't have to
be that way.

01:52:03.916 --> 01:52:06.180
You could change things,
right here and now!

01:52:06.251 --> 01:52:07.878
I'm sorry, son.
Ain't nothing I can do.

01:52:07.953 --> 01:52:09.978
You hear that, boy?
That's the way things are.

01:52:10.055 --> 01:52:11.682
Ain't nothing
or nobody can change it.

01:52:11.757 --> 01:52:14.590
Now get your black ass
out of here, and take
that trash with you!

01:52:14.660 --> 01:52:17.959
Hold on... hold on.
He... he's right.
He's right, Jeff.

01:52:18.030 --> 01:52:19.088
Get them on the bus.

01:52:19.164 --> 01:52:20.153
You sure?

01:52:20.232 --> 01:52:21.460
Get them back on the bus!

01:52:21.533 --> 01:52:23.160
Y'all heard him!
Y'all heard Ray!

01:52:23.235 --> 01:52:24.998
Back on the bus!

01:52:25.804 --> 01:52:26.862
Are you serious?

01:52:28.107 --> 01:52:29.233
Get them on the bus.

01:52:29.308 --> 01:52:30.775
I can't do nothing here.

01:52:30.843 --> 01:52:32.140
Ray, you know me.

01:52:32.211 --> 01:52:35.578
I'm not gonna lose money
just because you suddenly
got religion.

01:52:35.647 --> 01:52:36.807
Ain't nothing I can do, man.

01:52:36.882 --> 01:52:39.316
We have a contract with me.
You break it,
I'll sue your ass!

01:52:39.384 --> 01:52:41.477
I'll win, Ray!
You gotta do
what you gotta do.

01:52:41.553 --> 01:52:42.520
Look, I'll win big!

01:52:42.588 --> 01:52:43.680
Do what you gotta do.

01:52:43.756 --> 01:52:45.519
I told you,
I'll own your ass, Ray!

01:52:47.326 --> 01:52:48.486
Thank you, Mr. Charles.

01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:49.925
You could be the first.

01:52:49.995 --> 01:52:51.622
No, thank you, son.
You were right.

01:52:51.697 --> 01:52:53.221
You're right.

01:52:54.867 --> 01:52:56.960
You'll never
work Georgia again!

01:52:58.570 --> 01:53:02.006
He filed a lawsuit and
it's more than a fine, Ray.

01:53:02.608 --> 01:53:05.941
This guy's got juice.
He can get you barred from
ever playing Georgia again.

01:53:06.779 --> 01:53:10.078
But he's willing to drop
the suit if you'll
make up the gig.

01:53:10.582 --> 01:53:12.550
Not if it's segregated.

01:53:12.818 --> 01:53:13.807
Ray,

01:53:15.487 --> 01:53:18.456
I admire
what you're doing, man,
but you can't afford this.

01:53:18.524 --> 01:53:20.185
Georgia is
our highest-grossing state.

01:53:20.259 --> 01:53:23.990
I'm not playing any more
to Jim Crow joints ever again,
did you got that?

01:53:24.263 --> 01:53:25.924
Yeah. I got it.

01:53:26.431 --> 01:53:28.524
Jeff, get those people in here
so we can rehearse.

01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:30.090
Com on, y'all, let's go.

01:53:34.673 --> 01:53:36.698

Yeah. What's going on?

01:54:17.516 --> 01:54:18.847
Just kids onstage dancing.

01:54:18.917 --> 01:54:20.976
Well, let them dance.
That's what they're here for.

01:54:21.053 --> 01:54:23.283
Please don't hurt them!
Just keep dancing!

01:54:23.355 --> 01:54:24.686
Keep going!

Mr. Charles,
it's Western Union!

01:55:12.471 --> 01:55:13.995
We have a telegram
for you.

01:55:14.640 --> 01:55:16.005
You have to sign
for it, sir.

01:55:16.074 --> 01:55:17.098
I'm coming.

01:55:21.880 --> 01:55:24.872
Indianapolis police.
Got a report of loud music
coming from here.

01:55:24.950 --> 01:55:27.077
Where do you think
you're going, pal?

01:55:28.353 --> 01:55:29.911
I'm just going
to the bathroom.

01:55:29.988 --> 01:55:31.717
Handcuff
this son of a bitch.

01:55:32.424 --> 01:55:35.393
Recognize this, Ray?
Heroin's a felony.

01:55:35.928 --> 01:55:37.896
It ain't like
I'm dealing it, man.

01:55:37.963 --> 01:55:39.430
I'm not hurting nobody.

01:55:39.498 --> 01:55:41.398
Oh, no, you're
hurting everybody.

01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:44.535
Your jungle music is
poisoning our kids' minds.

01:55:44.603 --> 01:55:46.764
Hey, I'm gonna put
your black ass away forever.

01:55:46.838 --> 01:55:50.239
You have to understand.
I got... I got a wife,
I got kids.

01:55:50.309 --> 01:55:51.469
I got responsibilities.

01:55:51.543 --> 01:55:53.568
Why don't you tell that story
to these people.

01:55:53.645 --> 01:55:55.044
Bring them in!

01:55:57.983 --> 01:55:59.780
Ray! Was it a setup, Ray?

01:55:59.851 --> 01:56:01.716
How long you
been on heroin?

01:56:01.787 --> 01:56:03.152
Come on, Ray.

01:56:03.221 --> 01:56:05.246
What did they
charge you with?

01:56:13.298 --> 01:56:16.267

David.

01:56:48.266 --> 01:56:49.733
Uh, uh, Bea, he can stay.

01:56:49.801 --> 01:56:51.393
No. Baby, come on.

01:56:51.837 --> 01:56:53.134
Bea?
What?

01:56:54.806 --> 01:56:56.068
You know, since I got back...

01:56:56.141 --> 01:56:57.768
Since you got out.

01:56:57.976 --> 01:56:59.204
Yeah.

01:56:59.611 --> 01:57:03.172
Well, since I got here,
you haven't said more than
two words to me.

01:57:03.382 --> 01:57:05.373
Ray, what am I
supposed to say?

01:57:05.751 --> 01:57:08.276
My words don't seem to
mean much to you anymore.

01:57:08.353 --> 01:57:09.786
Maybe they never did.

01:57:09.855 --> 01:57:12.085
Come on, Bea,
you... you know I love you.

01:57:12.157 --> 01:57:13.852
Are you gonna stop then?

01:57:15.927 --> 01:57:17.986
You know what, Bea, what you
don't understand is

01:57:18.063 --> 01:57:20.361
there's a lot of
mean-spirited people
out there.

01:57:21.566 --> 01:57:22.555
Yeah.

01:57:27.606 --> 01:57:28.698
Ray?

01:57:32.177 --> 01:57:35.146
You know, I had to
bring Junior home
from school today

01:57:35.213 --> 01:57:37.044
'cause of what
the other kids were sayin'.

01:57:37.115 --> 01:57:38.582
They got mean-ass kids
around here.

01:57:38.650 --> 01:57:40.584
I think we should move
to Beverly Hills.

01:57:40.652 --> 01:57:42.176
No, no, Ray,
we're not gonna move.

01:57:42.254 --> 01:57:44.222
'Cause it... it's not
about where we live, Ray.

01:57:44.289 --> 01:57:46.655
It's about what you're doing
to yourself.

01:57:46.925 --> 01:57:48.552
And those boys worship you.

01:57:48.627 --> 01:57:51.027
You want them to end up
using that poison, too?

01:57:51.096 --> 01:57:52.757
Bea, that's not fair.

01:57:52.831 --> 01:57:55.493
What's not fair?
What's not fair, Ray?

01:57:55.567 --> 01:57:57.728
That... that's a low blow.

01:58:00.138 --> 01:58:01.127
Hello?

01:58:02.607 --> 01:58:05.872
Don't jive me, Milt.
Don't jive me, man!

01:58:05.944 --> 01:58:07.070
Really?

01:58:07.412 --> 01:58:11.007
Ah, good, good, good.
Tell... tell Sam
I said thank you.

01:58:11.083 --> 01:58:13.074
All right.
All right, then.

01:58:14.619 --> 01:58:15.677
Oh, yeah!

01:58:15.754 --> 01:58:18.450
What, Ray?
What? Come on, now.

01:58:18.523 --> 01:58:20.354
Ray, tell me what happened.

01:58:20.425 --> 01:58:22.620
ABC got the case dropped.

01:58:22.694 --> 01:58:24.491
The police
didn't have a warrant.

01:58:24.563 --> 01:58:25.723
They bought them off.

01:58:25.797 --> 01:58:27.765
Damn it, Bea, do you
want me to go to prison?

01:58:27.833 --> 01:58:30.301
No. Ray, I want you
to stop lying to yourself,

01:58:30.368 --> 01:58:32.461
and they are making that
completely impossible.

01:58:32.537 --> 01:58:34.061
You know what,
you don't understand.

01:58:34.139 --> 01:58:35.834
Then make me understand,
Ray!

01:58:35.907 --> 01:58:39.274
Baby, when I walk out
that door, I walk out alone
in the dark!

01:58:39.344 --> 01:58:40.743
I'm trying to
do something

01:58:40.812 --> 01:58:43.508
that ain't nobody ever done
in music and business.

01:58:43.582 --> 01:58:46.244
But I can't do it
if I'm alone
everywhere I go.

01:58:46.852 --> 01:58:49.184
I don't want to
be alone here, Bea.

01:58:49.254 --> 01:58:51.017
Not in my own home.

01:58:54.659 --> 01:58:57.321
Look, Bea,
if you don't understand me,

01:58:58.196 --> 01:58:59.720
then who will?

01:59:06.271 --> 01:59:07.863
I don't know, Ray.

01:59:11.476 --> 01:59:13.808
David? I'm coming!

01:59:14.913 --> 01:59:16.380
Mama's coming!

01:59:20.185 --> 01:59:24.121
Ray, we pull you
out of the fire,
and you want country music?

01:59:24.189 --> 01:59:27.283
Look here, I've been singing
country music all my life.

01:59:27.359 --> 01:59:29.850
As a matter of fact,
I used to play with
the Florida Playboys.

01:59:29.928 --> 01:59:31.418
We made a big
investment in you

01:59:31.496 --> 01:59:32.963
and it's paying off
handsomely.

01:59:33.031 --> 01:59:34.726
For both of us,
I might add.

01:59:34.799 --> 01:59:36.357
We don't want to
lose your fan base.

01:59:36.434 --> 01:59:38.493
Yeah, you know,
you got a point there,

01:59:38.570 --> 01:59:42.028
but I actually think that
we have more to gain
than we do to lose.

01:59:42.974 --> 01:59:45.636
Ray, it's a bad idea.

01:59:47.679 --> 01:59:50.113
When I came to ABC, you guys
put in the contract

01:59:50.182 --> 01:59:52.241
that I can choose
my own music.

01:59:53.118 --> 01:59:54.847
You want to read
that paragraph?

01:59:59.057 --> 02:00:00.786
It's on page three.

02:00:02.127 --> 02:00:03.685
I don't need to see it.

02:00:13.071 --> 02:00:15.301
Good evening, Saint Louis.

02:00:15.373 --> 02:00:17.739
It's time
for the main attraction.

02:00:17.809 --> 02:00:21.370
The innovator of soul.
The genius himself.

02:00:21.713 --> 02:00:23.510
Ray Charles!

02:00:42.934 --> 02:00:44.128
Go on, go on, Ray!

02:00:49.307 --> 02:00:50.535
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

02:00:50.609 --> 02:00:53.772
<i>You know what,
I know that a lot of y'all
don't know that</i>

02:00:53.845 --> 02:00:57.008
<i>I... I was brought up
in the South.</i>

02:00:57.082 --> 02:01:00.210
<i>You know, every time
you turn on the radio there
in the South,</i>

02:01:00.285 --> 02:01:01.650
<i>you hear the Grand Ole Opry.</i>

02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:04.848
<i>That's what I grew up singing,
so I hope you don't mind,</i>

02:01:05.490 --> 02:01:08.982
<i>I... I want to sing something
to give you a taste
of my country roots.</i>

02:01:10.228 --> 02:01:11.525
<i>Unchain My Heart!</i>

02:01:11.730 --> 02:01:13.288
<i>Georgia on My Mind, Ray!</i>

02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:17.830
# I can't stop loving you #

02:01:18.470 --> 02:01:21.496
Turn 'em, the lights up top
and on the mezzanine,

02:01:21.906 --> 02:01:25.239
let's take everything down
and hit Ray
with a follow spot.

02:01:25.310 --> 02:01:26.800
We're doing it,
on it on my count.

02:01:27.145 --> 02:01:29.136
# To live in memory #

02:01:30.048 --> 02:01:32.209
IN 5, 4...

02:01:32.684 --> 02:01:35.881
# of the lonesome times #

02:01:36.988 --> 02:01:40.048
# Yeah #

02:01:40.125 --> 02:01:44.653
# I can't stop wanting you #

02:01:46.731 --> 02:01:50.599
# It's useless to say #

02:01:53.772 --> 02:01:57.503
# So I'll just live my life #

02:01:57.575 --> 02:01:59.873
# I'll live my life #

02:02:00.345 --> 02:02:03.678
# in dreams of yesterday #

02:02:07.319 --> 02:02:11.187
# Those happy hours #

02:02:11.256 --> 02:02:14.817
# Those happy hours #

02:02:15.093 --> 02:02:18.551
# that we once knew ##

02:02:19.898 --> 02:02:21.058
Cab's here.

02:02:21.132 --> 02:02:22.190
Okay.

02:02:22.267 --> 02:02:26.670
Dad, if you can't see,
how can you choose
the right color socks?

02:02:26.738 --> 02:02:28.672
I'm... I'm gonna show you,
all right?

02:02:28.740 --> 02:02:30.002
Let me show you something.

02:02:30.075 --> 02:02:31.940
See? Right here?

02:02:32.344 --> 02:02:35.336
The two, right there,
I got it sewn in thick,
so I can feel it.

02:02:35.480 --> 02:02:37.141
So, it means two is brown.

02:02:37.215 --> 02:02:39.547
One is black. Three is blue.

02:02:39.617 --> 02:02:41.380
And... and... and where's four?

02:02:41.486 --> 02:02:42.578
Nowhere.

02:02:42.654 --> 02:02:45.088
Four ain't nowhere.
There ain't no four.
You're right.

02:02:47.392 --> 02:02:50.384
# Heals a broken heart #

02:02:50.495 --> 02:02:53.430
# But time has stood still #

02:02:53.498 --> 02:02:56.194
# Time has stood still #

02:02:56.267 --> 02:02:59.634
# Since we've been apart #

02:02:59.704 --> 02:03:02.537
# Since we've been apart ##

02:03:20.692 --> 02:03:22.284
Still working on the balcony.

02:03:22.360 --> 02:03:24.123
Okay, guys, we got
10 minutes to load out!

02:03:24.195 --> 02:03:25.719
Change back at the hotel.

02:03:25.797 --> 02:03:27.856
They bought that
country jive hook,
line and sinker.

02:03:27.932 --> 02:03:29.126
Ray, man,
you're amazing.

02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:32.328
I'm gonna tell you something.
Country music.
You know why they like it?

02:03:32.404 --> 02:03:34.531
The stories, man.
They got great stories.

02:03:34.606 --> 02:03:35.664
Hey, Joe.

02:03:35.740 --> 02:03:39.107
Ray, I want to introduce you
to Joe Adams.
Hal Ziegler hired Joe

02:03:39.177 --> 02:03:41.543
as the announcer
for the rest of the tour.

02:03:41.613 --> 02:03:44.138
I know you,
Mayor of Melody.

02:03:44.215 --> 02:03:46.683
I used to listen to your
radio show in L.A.
In the '50s.

02:03:46.751 --> 02:03:49.311
We've both come
a ways since then.

02:03:49.387 --> 02:03:52.015
What was that counting
you were doing back there?

02:03:52.123 --> 02:03:54.683
I was cueing down the lights.
That shuts up the audience

02:03:54.759 --> 02:03:57.387
so you can sing your ballad
instead of
having to scream it.

02:03:57.462 --> 02:03:59.760
Hey, well, I'll be damned.
Who told you to do that?

02:03:59.831 --> 02:04:01.560
No one.
It just needed to be done.

02:04:01.633 --> 02:04:03.498
See, that's what
I'm talking about.

02:04:03.568 --> 02:04:06.469
I like to hear a person say
"It needed to be done"

02:04:06.538 --> 02:04:09.268
as opposed to
a person saying,
"It ain't my job."

02:04:09.741 --> 02:04:11.675
You know,
tell me about Central Avenue.

02:04:12.177 --> 02:04:13.041
I know you know
Jack Lauderdale.

02:04:14.212 --> 02:04:15.645
Hello, New York!

02:04:15.713 --> 02:04:17.044
Hello, Boston!

02:04:17.315 --> 02:04:18.646
Hello, Saint Louis!

02:04:18.716 --> 02:04:20.479
Good evening, San Francisco!

02:04:22.287 --> 02:04:24.050
<i># Bye bye love #</i>

02:04:25.023 --> 02:04:26.923
<i># Bye bye happiness #</i>

02:04:27.926 --> 02:04:29.553
Ray, I got
some good news for you.

02:04:29.627 --> 02:04:31.219
<i>We got the cover of Cash Box.</i>

02:04:31.296 --> 02:04:34.527
"The nation's hottest album:
Modern Sounds of
Country & Western."

02:04:34.599 --> 02:04:35.657
You are hotter
than hell.

02:04:35.733 --> 02:04:36.722
That's what they say.

02:04:36.801 --> 02:04:39.201
I've been watchin',
your albums are
going through the roof,

02:04:39.270 --> 02:04:40.999
your concerts are
always selling out.

02:04:41.072 --> 02:04:42.630
You'll need shelters
for your money.

02:04:42.707 --> 02:04:44.231
You're in a
new tax bracket.

02:04:44.309 --> 02:04:47.142
Keep your drawers on, Fathead!
I got the instruments!

02:04:47.212 --> 02:04:49.680
<i>Jeff, Joe was in
the film Carmen Jones.</i>

02:04:49.747 --> 02:04:51.271
Who was
the director again?

02:04:51.349 --> 02:04:52.407
Otto Preminger.

02:04:52.484 --> 02:04:55.578
He was also on Broadway
with Lena Horne.

02:04:55.720 --> 02:04:58.154
She was the star.
I was supporting.

02:04:58.323 --> 02:04:59.881
Is that a fact?

02:05:00.058 --> 02:05:03.289
<i>Prepare for an extraordinary
evening of music.</i>

02:05:03.361 --> 02:05:05.329
Perhaps the most innovative,
unique

02:05:05.396 --> 02:05:07.296
and energetic
musical voice today.

02:05:07.365 --> 02:05:08.662
Please welcome
to the stage...

02:05:08.733 --> 02:05:09.995
It is my distinct pleasure...

02:05:10.068 --> 02:05:12.366
Please give
your warmest welcome,
the one-of-a-kind...

02:05:12.437 --> 02:05:13.870
I present Mr. Ray...

02:05:13.938 --> 02:05:15.872
Ray... Ray Charles!

02:05:17.675 --> 02:05:19.438
# Bye bye love #

02:05:20.778 --> 02:05:22.678
# Bye bye sweet caress #

02:05:23.414 --> 02:05:25.211
# Hello emptiness #

02:05:25.316 --> 02:05:27.147
# I think I'm gonna die #

02:05:30.555 --> 02:05:32.216
<i># Bye bye love #</i>

02:05:38.196 --> 02:05:39.629
<i># I think I'm gonna die #</i>

02:05:43.234 --> 02:05:44.861
<i># I think I'm gonna die #</i>

02:05:45.069 --> 02:05:46.502
...Ray Charles!

02:05:48.273 --> 02:05:49.934
<i># I think I'm gonna die #</i>

02:05:50.975 --> 02:05:52.636
<i># I think I'm gonna die ##</i>

02:05:53.444 --> 02:05:55.639
Bea, there's a park right
at the end of the street.

02:05:55.713 --> 02:05:57.977
You can see the whole L.A.
basin from there.

02:05:58.049 --> 02:06:00.210
Not even Beverly Hills
has views like that.

02:06:00.285 --> 02:06:02.981
How does it look, Bea, huh?
You like it, don't you?

02:06:03.054 --> 02:06:04.578
I don't know.
I haven't seen it.

02:06:04.656 --> 02:06:06.089
You got to like it.

02:06:06.157 --> 02:06:07.146
Voilà.

02:06:07.225 --> 02:06:10.558
This foyer is designed
to impress anybody
who walks through the door.

02:06:10.628 --> 02:06:13.654
<i>It has a big
winding staircase,
just like Gone With the Wind.</i>

02:06:13.731 --> 02:06:16.894
We should get
our portraits painted,
like Rhett and Scarlett.

02:06:17.135 --> 02:06:18.625
Bea, bring him in here.

02:06:18.703 --> 02:06:21.103
Ray, wait till you hear
what's waiting
in the living room.

02:06:21.172 --> 02:06:22.161
What is it?

02:06:22.273 --> 02:06:26.107
I had them build you
a solid marble fireplace,
two stories high.

02:06:26.210 --> 02:06:28.371
Hot damn!
How do you like it, Bea?

02:06:28.446 --> 02:06:29.538
It's awful big.

02:06:29.614 --> 02:06:31.206
It sure is:
8,500 square feet.

02:06:31.282 --> 02:06:33.079
Biggest house in
the neighborhood.

02:06:33.151 --> 02:06:34.914
So, does this meet
with your approval?

02:06:34.986 --> 02:06:36.476
Man, this is a palace.

02:06:36.554 --> 02:06:39.045
You think this is big?
Wait until tomorrow
when you see

02:06:39.123 --> 02:06:41.421
30,000 square feet
of RPM Incorporated.

02:06:41.492 --> 02:06:43.255
Yeah, headquarters!

02:06:43.328 --> 02:06:45.694
This is it, Ray. Your
brand-new recording studio.

02:06:45.763 --> 02:06:47.390
Did you get
everything I asked for?

02:06:47.465 --> 02:06:48.727
Totally state-of-the-art.

02:06:48.800 --> 02:06:52.759
Tom Dowd built
an eight-track mixing console,
two recorders, the works.

02:06:52.837 --> 02:06:55.237
Now, this room is bigger
than most people's houses.

02:06:55.306 --> 02:06:57.740
Got your own private bathroom
to your left.

02:06:57.809 --> 02:07:00.073
Right behind you
is my adjoining office.

02:07:00.144 --> 02:07:02.510
And step over
to your private bar
to your left.

02:07:02.580 --> 02:07:04.480
Got a bottle of Bols
right in the center.

02:07:04.549 --> 02:07:05.948
You know me pretty good.

02:07:06.017 --> 02:07:08.417
If you run out, shout,
I'm right next door.

02:07:08.753 --> 02:07:10.084
This is nice, right here.

02:07:10.154 --> 02:07:11.553
It's the house
that Ray built.

02:07:11.623 --> 02:07:12.681
Yes, it is.

02:07:12.957 --> 02:07:14.652
<i># Born to lose #</i>

02:07:16.327 --> 02:07:20.024
<i># I've lived my life
in vain ##</i>

02:07:24.736 --> 02:07:26.533
Ray Junior, slow down!

02:07:26.604 --> 02:07:28.469
This ain't no
baseball diamond!

02:07:30.942 --> 02:07:32.603
Charles residence.

02:07:33.277 --> 02:07:34.904
Mr. Charles?

02:07:35.113 --> 02:07:37.604
Hey, girl,
Bring that boy over here!

02:07:37.682 --> 02:07:39.843
I got a hot dog
with his name on it!
Come on, now.

02:07:39.917 --> 02:07:41.077
Hello.

02:07:41.552 --> 02:07:43.679
Uh, yes,
I know who you are.

02:07:44.989 --> 02:07:47.150
What? Oh, God, no.

02:07:47.725 --> 02:07:48.657
Ray.

02:07:48.726 --> 02:07:52.218
Yes, I'll get on a plane
and I'll be there
as soon as I can.

02:07:52.296 --> 02:07:53.627
What happened?

02:07:55.767 --> 02:07:57.098
Margie's dead.

02:07:57.468 --> 02:07:59.129
Oh, God! H-How?

02:08:00.905 --> 02:08:02.395
She overdosed.

02:08:05.777 --> 02:08:07.574
I didn't start her, Bea.

02:08:08.713 --> 02:08:10.203
I didn't let her
do dope around me.

02:08:10.281 --> 02:08:12.249
I... I just wouldn't
let that happen.

02:08:12.316 --> 02:08:15.581
Yes, I'm sure, Ray.
I'm sure you set
a fine example.

02:08:19.724 --> 02:08:21.487
What about her baby?

02:08:25.963 --> 02:08:27.225
You knew?

02:08:27.965 --> 02:08:29.990
His name is Charles Wayne.

02:08:30.368 --> 02:08:34.202
He was born October 1,
in New York City.
He's 3 years old.

02:08:35.173 --> 02:08:36.663
The baby's fine.

02:08:37.575 --> 02:08:39.372
He's at her sister's.

02:08:41.145 --> 02:08:43.113
All right.
I'll start sending them
some money.

02:08:43.181 --> 02:08:46.275
You don't have to.
I send them
money every month.

02:09:11.142 --> 02:09:12.734
In five minutes,
Mr. Charles will be here,

02:09:12.810 --> 02:09:14.277
and he'll be ready to go.

02:09:14.345 --> 02:09:15.903
Now the charts
Jeff is handing out

02:09:15.980 --> 02:09:18.778
should be turned in
at the conclusion of...

02:09:19.217 --> 02:09:21.447
You're late,
that's a $50 fine.

02:09:22.019 --> 02:09:23.452
I ain't late.

02:09:23.521 --> 02:09:25.614
I give them
a 10-minute grace period, Joe.

02:09:25.690 --> 02:09:28.989
2:05. He's late.
He'll be charged $50.

02:09:29.060 --> 02:09:31.551
What? You know what?
Where's Ray?

02:09:31.629 --> 02:09:33.995
You don't have to talk to Ray,
you're talking to me.

02:09:34.065 --> 02:09:38.263
I'll talk to whoever
I damn well please,
and it sure as hell ain't you.

02:09:38.336 --> 02:09:39.667
Jive jerk.

02:09:44.408 --> 02:09:45.568
Hey, Ray,

02:09:45.643 --> 02:09:49.773
this fool Joe Adams
is trying to fine me
for being late.

02:09:50.081 --> 02:09:51.548
What time did you get here?

02:09:51.616 --> 02:09:55.609
What? Just now.
The band's still setting up.

02:09:56.220 --> 02:09:57.847
Jeff don't...
Look, I'm not Jeff.

02:09:57.922 --> 02:09:59.685
That's a fact, Jack!

02:10:00.858 --> 02:10:03.520
Ray, you said
the band was my thing.

02:10:03.594 --> 02:10:05.061
It is.

02:10:05.129 --> 02:10:07.791
Then, Fathead,
you go on back to rehearsal.

02:10:08.833 --> 02:10:10.198
Ray.

02:10:10.635 --> 02:10:13.069
Ray, you know how it is,
you've been there.

02:10:13.604 --> 02:10:15.936
Fathead, go on now.
Let me handle this.

02:10:16.007 --> 02:10:17.736
Fathead, go on now.

02:10:21.179 --> 02:10:23.272
You want to tell me
what the hell
is going on, Ray?

02:10:23.347 --> 02:10:25.372
I'm not doing anything
I haven't been asked to.

02:10:25.449 --> 02:10:27.007
Ray's running a business.

02:10:27.084 --> 02:10:30.110
He shouldn't
have to waste time
hearing why people were late.

02:10:30.188 --> 02:10:31.985
I'm not talking
to you, Joe.

02:10:32.056 --> 02:10:33.785
I'm talking to Ray.

02:10:38.763 --> 02:10:41.698
Ray, now I know you think
I'm soft on the band,

02:10:41.766 --> 02:10:44.132
but those cats would do
whatever I ask.

02:10:44.202 --> 02:10:46.864
But If you come in here
with this, uh,
"running a business" crap,

02:10:46.938 --> 02:10:49.168
you're gonna lose
some good people.
I'm telling you, Ray.

02:10:49.240 --> 02:10:51.640
There are musicians
waiting in line
to play with Ray Charles.

02:10:51.709 --> 02:10:54.542
Not for long,
once they get a taste of you.

02:10:55.213 --> 02:10:57.443
Ray, you're the leader, man.
Be one! Come on, now.

02:10:57.515 --> 02:10:59.506
You now what Jeff, I mean
things have changed.

02:10:59.584 --> 02:11:02.644
It ain't like the days
when it was seven of us
on the Chitlin' Circuit.

02:11:02.720 --> 02:11:06.178
I mean, if you weren't busy
building a bowling alley,
you'd seen that.

02:11:06.591 --> 02:11:08.422
So you know about that, huh?

02:11:08.860 --> 02:11:10.794
I know about everything.

02:11:11.395 --> 02:11:13.386
I'm just trying to figure out
how you did it.

02:11:13.464 --> 02:11:15.091
You think
I'm stealing from you, Ray?

02:11:15.166 --> 02:11:18.431
If the Shaw Agency is gonna
give you a cut of
the 10 percent I'm given them.

02:11:18.502 --> 02:11:21.471
I might as well keep
the goddamn money
in my pocket.

02:11:21.739 --> 02:11:24.037
Leave us alone.
We need to talk.

02:11:25.142 --> 02:11:26.200
Ray.

02:11:26.644 --> 02:11:28.669
You can step outside, Joe.

02:11:30.514 --> 02:11:32.311
I'll be in my office.

02:11:37.755 --> 02:11:41.657
Ray, now I know
that jealous bastard
planted that lie in your head.

02:11:42.793 --> 02:11:45.261
But I have never stolen
from you, Ray,
and I never will.

02:11:45.329 --> 02:11:49.163
I got a small business loan,
and, yeah, Milt Shaw
was giving me a little extra,

02:11:49.233 --> 02:11:50.860
but I'm not a thief, Ray.

02:11:50.935 --> 02:11:52.266
Then what about that,
Jeff, huh?

02:11:52.336 --> 02:11:56.432
A promoter swearing you did
side deals with him so
you could split my overages!

02:11:56.507 --> 02:11:58.372
How could you do that to me?

02:11:58.442 --> 02:12:00.535
We've been through so much,
we be so like brothers.

02:12:00.611 --> 02:12:02.340
You know what, Ray?

02:12:03.414 --> 02:12:06.440
If we were like brothers,

02:12:06.751 --> 02:12:09.185
why are you paying Joe
more than you're paying me?

02:12:09.253 --> 02:12:11.619
Damn all that!
You broke my heart, man.

02:12:11.689 --> 02:12:16.023
Well, you know what, Ray?
You broke mine
a long goddamn time ago!

02:12:16.861 --> 02:12:18.795
Well, then there it is.

02:12:25.436 --> 02:12:27.063
You know something, Ray?

02:12:27.138 --> 02:12:28.935
You're going to get yours
one day.

02:12:29.006 --> 02:12:32.806
And I pray to God that he
has mercy on your soul,
you son of a bitch!

02:12:40.584 --> 02:12:42.609
Everything all right, Ray?

02:12:43.854 --> 02:12:46.152
How the hell
do you think it is?

02:12:56.867 --> 02:13:00.200
Go tell him. Go tell him!
Go, go tell him.

02:13:01.772 --> 02:13:03.137
Hey, Dad. Hi, there.

02:13:03.207 --> 02:13:05.232
I made the all-star team!
The game's on Thursday.

02:13:05.309 --> 02:13:06.367
Oh, that's great.

02:13:06.444 --> 02:13:09.174
Oh, damn!
I'm not gonna be in town.
I'm gotta go on tour.

02:13:09.246 --> 02:13:11.840
How about I buy you guys
new uniforms, huh?

02:13:11.916 --> 02:13:13.941
Tell the coach
I don't care
how much they cost.

02:13:14.018 --> 02:13:14.950
Okay.

02:13:15.019 --> 02:13:17.579
All right, son,
you want to take
your dad's briefcase inside.

02:13:17.655 --> 02:13:20.283
The plane to Montreal
leaves at 11:00.
I'll pick you up at 8:30.

02:13:20.358 --> 02:13:21.347
All right.

02:13:21.859 --> 02:13:23.827
Did you hear what
Ray Junior said to you?

02:13:23.894 --> 02:13:24.826
Yeah.

02:13:24.895 --> 02:13:27.227
Do you know how much
making the all-star team
means to him?

02:13:27.298 --> 02:13:29.766
I know.
I got things on my mind.
We had to fire Jeff.

02:13:29.834 --> 02:13:30.823
What?

02:13:30.901 --> 02:13:31.925
He was stealing.

02:13:32.003 --> 02:13:33.095
Jeff?
Hmm.

02:13:33.170 --> 02:13:34.467
I don't believe it.

02:13:34.538 --> 02:13:36.506
Yeah, well,
we're better without him.

02:13:36.640 --> 02:13:39.108
<i># My mother told me #</i>

02:13:43.914 --> 02:13:46.542
# 'Fore she passed away #

02:13:48.052 --> 02:13:51.749
# Said son when I'm gone #

02:13:52.089 --> 02:13:54.023
# Don't forget to pray #

02:13:54.091 --> 02:13:56.389
# 'Cause there'll be
hard times #

02:13:58.963 --> 02:14:01.523
# Hard times #

02:14:01.599 --> 02:14:04.500
# Oh, yeah, yeah #

02:14:04.568 --> 02:14:08.197
# Who knows better than I ##

02:14:37.535 --> 02:14:38.968
Excuse me!
Get 'em out!

02:14:39.403 --> 02:14:41.064
U.S. Customs!

02:14:41.172 --> 02:14:43.470
We're goanna need
to see some identification,
please.

02:14:43.541 --> 02:14:45.270
You just arrived
from Montreal?

02:14:45.342 --> 02:14:46.741
Yes. Is there a problem?

02:14:46.811 --> 02:14:49.143
We were alerted
there might be drugs
on this plane.

02:14:49.213 --> 02:14:51.579
What? That's outrageous!
I'm going to call our lawyer.

02:14:51.649 --> 02:14:53.879
No lawyers
at international checkpoints.

02:14:53.951 --> 02:14:56.476
Now, we're going
to have to search
everyone on this plane.

02:14:56.554 --> 02:14:59.284
Mr. Charles,
if you don't mind
we'd like to start with you.

02:14:59.356 --> 02:15:01.221
I'd like to see your overcoat.

02:15:01.292 --> 02:15:02.520
I don't mind.

02:15:02.593 --> 02:15:03.992
Don't say anything, Ray.

02:15:04.628 --> 02:15:05.686
What's this?

02:15:07.665 --> 02:15:10.031
Ray, this isn't some judge
in Indiana.

02:15:10.101 --> 02:15:12.160
It's federal.
They can charge you
of smuggling

02:15:12.236 --> 02:15:13.931
which can mean
real prison time.

02:15:15.239 --> 02:15:18.231
Our lawyers will do
what they can, but...

02:15:38.028 --> 02:15:39.325
Hello.

02:15:41.465 --> 02:15:43.330
You can't hide out
in here forever, Ray.

02:15:43.400 --> 02:15:45.231
Look, it's my house.
I'm not in prison yet.

02:15:45.302 --> 02:15:46.360
No, it's my house.

02:15:46.437 --> 02:15:49.304
You ain't been here
more than six days
since we moved in.

02:15:49.373 --> 02:15:51.432
No, Ray, no! A needle
ain't gonna solve this!

02:15:51.509 --> 02:15:52.476
Get out of the way.
Move!

02:15:52.543 --> 02:15:54.374
Only thing
that can help you is God, Ray.

02:15:54.445 --> 02:15:57.141
Don't think of God?
Do you have any idea
how it feels to go blind

02:15:57.214 --> 02:15:58.647
and still be afraid
of the dark?

02:15:58.716 --> 02:16:01.879
And every day, you stand pray
for just a little light,
and you get nothing.

02:16:01.952 --> 02:16:03.783
'Cause God don't listen
to people like me.

02:16:03.854 --> 02:16:04.912
Stop talking like that.

02:16:04.989 --> 02:16:07.890
As far as I'm concerned,
me and God is even
and I do what I please.

02:16:07.958 --> 02:16:10.017
If goddamn it,
if I want to shoot up,
I shoot up.

02:16:10.094 --> 02:16:12.790
Then go ahead!
But you walk out that door

02:16:12.863 --> 02:16:15.229
and I'm doing something
I should have done
a long time ago.

02:16:15.299 --> 02:16:17.028
I'm taking my boys
and I'll leave.

02:16:17.101 --> 02:16:19.126
You're not going away.
You... you have no place to go.

02:16:19.203 --> 02:16:20.727
No place?
No.

02:16:20.804 --> 02:16:22.897
You think I'm
scared of losing this?

02:16:22.973 --> 02:16:25.908
Ray, the only thing I was
ever scared of losing
was you.

02:16:25.976 --> 02:16:29.104
Because where was
I ever gonna find
another Ray Robinson?

02:16:30.614 --> 02:16:33.174
So I put up with
some terrible stuff.

02:16:33.416 --> 02:16:35.248
Maybe that makes me
part to blame.

02:16:35.318 --> 02:16:36.650
But I ain't scared
no more.

02:16:36.719 --> 02:16:39.415
You know I love you
and those boys
more than anything.

02:16:39.490 --> 02:16:41.924
That is a damn lie
and you know it!

02:16:43.459 --> 02:16:45.120
You ever look at this?

02:16:45.361 --> 02:16:47.626
Really look at it, Ray!

02:16:47.965 --> 02:16:51.025
Ray Charles Junior's
"Most Valuable Player."

02:16:52.468 --> 02:16:54.629
He was so proud this day,

02:16:55.706 --> 02:16:59.574
until you came home too loaded
to go to his banquet.

02:16:59.643 --> 02:17:02.907
No! No! There is something
you love more than
me and them boys,

02:17:02.980 --> 02:17:05.642
more than all the women
you ever slept with
on the road,

02:17:05.716 --> 02:17:07.343
more than all
the dope you ever took.

02:17:07.418 --> 02:17:09.750
What are you talking about?
Your music.

02:17:11.655 --> 02:17:13.986
And if you don't stop
using that needle,

02:17:14.091 --> 02:17:17.218
they're gonna
take away your music
and put you in jail.

02:17:21.130 --> 02:17:23.463
Is that poison
worth losing everything?

02:18:05.575 --> 02:18:07.236
Mr. Charles?

02:18:19.623 --> 02:18:21.112
Mr. Charles.

02:18:21.791 --> 02:18:23.589
You don't have to
go through this.

02:18:24.460 --> 02:18:28.295
We have a substitute
that can help
wean you off heroin.

02:18:28.632 --> 02:18:32.830
I have to do it on my own.
I can do it. I can do it.

02:18:33.570 --> 02:18:35.003
Ah. Don't touch me.

02:18:38.342 --> 02:18:39.673
All right.

02:18:40.209 --> 02:18:41.905
We'll do it your way.

02:18:52.990 --> 02:18:54.321
Doctor?

02:18:54.591 --> 02:18:57.617
Mr. Charles. Mr. Charles,
I'm coming.

02:18:58.361 --> 02:19:00.091
He's got no fluids left.

02:19:00.230 --> 02:19:01.959
Get an I.V.
In him right away.

02:19:02.366 --> 02:19:04.197
I'll insert the needle.
No needles.

02:19:04.300 --> 02:19:06.235
Yes. It's very important.
You need this.

02:19:06.303 --> 02:19:08.236
Runner, I've got a runner!

02:19:08.906 --> 02:19:09.895
Whoa.

02:19:11.475 --> 02:19:13.875
Let me go. Let me go.
Get him on the bed.

02:19:14.477 --> 02:19:16.968
Put those restraints on him.

02:19:17.448 --> 02:19:19.040
No needles.

02:19:37.300 --> 02:19:38.768
No, no.

02:19:39.770 --> 02:19:41.135
Oh.

02:19:45.142 --> 02:19:47.474
George, I miss you.
I miss you, George.

02:19:47.611 --> 02:19:49.943
I miss you.

02:19:54.585 --> 02:19:55.916
Oh.

02:20:09.099 --> 02:20:10.691
Okay. Uh-oh.

02:20:10.768 --> 02:20:13.066
You might be in trouble
right there, Doc.

02:20:22.045 --> 02:20:24.377
Hot damn,
you whupped my ass again!

02:20:24.448 --> 02:20:27.212
I-I'll tell you what,
I won't lose again
the same way twice.

02:20:27.284 --> 02:20:30.776
I spoke with
the judge in Boston,
and he'll agree to probation.

02:20:31.054 --> 02:20:33.318
He was impressed with
your attorney's arguments,

02:20:33.390 --> 02:20:35.449
and he believes
you deserve one more chance.

02:20:35.526 --> 02:20:36.925
Oh, that's great.

02:20:36.994 --> 02:20:38.985
But you must
complete our program

02:20:39.129 --> 02:20:41.120
and agree to take
periodic drug tests.

02:20:41.198 --> 02:20:43.428
You know what. I'll do it.
I know people don't believe

02:20:43.500 --> 02:20:45.695
I'm done with this dope,
but I'm finished.

02:20:46.637 --> 02:20:47.968
Who's George?

02:20:52.810 --> 02:20:53.868
Ray,

02:20:54.478 --> 02:20:57.276
you've come through
the worst of
the physical reactions.

02:20:57.881 --> 02:21:00.714
We should begin
psychotherapy sessions.

02:21:00.784 --> 02:21:03.378
Uh, look, forget
the head shrinking, Doc.

02:21:03.454 --> 02:21:05.081
I can handle this.

02:21:09.460 --> 02:21:10.893
Mr. Charles,

02:21:10.961 --> 02:21:13.623
you're not the first
celebrity junkie I've treated.

02:21:13.697 --> 02:21:14.823
Junkie? What...

02:21:14.898 --> 02:21:16.923
Nobody cons me
at any price.

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:18.024
I'm not trying
to do that.

02:21:18.101 --> 02:21:21.298
If you want me
to give that judge
a positive report,

02:21:21.371 --> 02:21:23.339
you will have to earn it.

02:21:26.810 --> 02:21:27.868
Doc?

02:21:28.812 --> 02:21:30.279
Dr. Hacker?

02:21:30.781 --> 02:21:31.839
Doc?

02:22:04.281 --> 02:22:07.114
<i>Ray, come on, Ray,
play with me!</i>

02:22:11.154 --> 02:22:12.815
<i>He ain't there.</i>

02:22:21.198 --> 02:22:23.029
Talk to me, son.

02:22:24.001 --> 02:22:27.528
I ain't no bad dream.
I'm a part of you.

02:22:27.871 --> 02:22:30.362
Even all that dope
couldn't keep me away.

02:22:33.343 --> 02:22:35.311
Mama, I kept my promise.

02:22:35.445 --> 02:22:37.310
You got strong all right.

02:22:37.381 --> 02:22:39.212
Went places
I never dreamed of.

02:22:39.917 --> 02:22:42.181
But you still
became a cripple.

02:22:47.958 --> 02:22:50.017
Come here, baby.
Come here.

02:22:57.634 --> 02:22:58.794
Ray?

02:23:05.309 --> 02:23:07.038
It wasn't your fault.

02:23:12.449 --> 02:23:13.939
Now promise us

02:23:14.217 --> 02:23:15.946
you'll never let
nobody or nothing

02:23:16.019 --> 02:23:18.419
turn you into
no cripple ever again.

02:23:18.589 --> 02:23:21.581
That you'll always stand
on your own two feet.

02:23:22.559 --> 02:23:23.719
Promise.

02:23:44.648 --> 02:23:46.707
<i>Today we're here
to right a wrong</i>

02:23:46.783 --> 02:23:50.219
<i>that was done to one
of our native sons
nearly 20 years ago.</i>

02:23:50.754 --> 02:23:52.221
<i>In 1961,</i>

02:23:52.789 --> 02:23:55.952
<i>Ray Charles was banned
from performing
in the state of Georgia</i>

02:23:56.059 --> 02:23:59.187
<i>because he refused to play
before a segregated audience.</i>

02:23:59.463 --> 02:24:02.432
<i>Thankfully, we've come
a long way since then.</i>

02:24:02.866 --> 02:24:06.199
<i>Some of us have fought
for equality through
the political process,</i>

02:24:06.470 --> 02:24:10.804
<i>but Ray Charles
changed American culture
by touching people's hearts.</i>

02:24:11.141 --> 02:24:14.907
<i>So on this day,
March 7, 1979,</i>

02:24:15.445 --> 02:24:18.608
<i>we, the duly
elected representatives
of the state of Georgia</i>

02:24:18.949 --> 02:24:22.942
<i>not only proclaim
Georgia on My Mind
our official state song,</i>

02:24:23.286 --> 02:24:26.483
<i>we also offer Mr. Ray Charles
a public apology</i>

02:24:26.556 --> 02:24:28.490
<i>and welcome him back home.</i>

02:24:37.267 --> 02:24:42.034
<i># Every time
I sing this song #</i>

02:24:48.311 --> 02:24:50.438
If only your mama was here.

02:24:51.114 --> 02:24:52.445
She's here.

02:24:53.116 --> 02:24:54.913
She ain't never left.

02:24:55.152 --> 02:24:56.744
<i># I sing for #</i>

02:24:59.389 --> 02:25:01.254

02:25:04.394 --> 02:25:06.988
<i># Whoa, Georgia #</i>

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:13.060
<i># The whole day through #</i>

02:25:16.206 --> 02:25:18.299
<i># Just this old, sweet song #</i>

02:25:22.112 --> 02:25:25.878
<i># Keeps Georgia on my mind #</i>

02:25:33.757 --> 02:25:35.952
<i># Georgia #</i>

02:25:36.026 --> 02:25:37.857
<i># Oh, yeah #</i>

02:25:41.131 --> 02:25:44.123
<i># Yeah, Georgia #</i>

02:25:46.770 --> 02:25:50.831
<i># A song of you #</i>

02:25:54.244 --> 02:25:56.439
<i># Comes as sweet and clear #</i>

02:25:59.850 --> 02:26:04.583
<i># as moonlight
through the pines #</i>

02:26:11.228 --> 02:26:13.128
<i># I feel that #</i>

02:26:15.232 --> 02:26:19.862
<i># Other arms #</i>

02:26:24.174 --> 02:26:28.907

02:26:33.717 --> 02:26:38.017

02:27:08.385 --> 02:27:12.014
<i># Still in peaceful dreams #</i>

02:27:14.024 --> 02:27:16.891
<i># I see a busy road #</i>

02:27:17.928 --> 02:27:21.830

02:27:33.343 --> 02:27:35.140

02:27:37.747 --> 02:27:39.874
