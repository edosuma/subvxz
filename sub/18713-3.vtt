<i>No, I'm really not happy with
the arrangements for this evening.</i>

01:02.810 --> 01:04.119
Couple of things.

01:04.120 --> 01:07.479
You say you can fit an extra ten
people in the alcove by the window,

01:07.480 --> 01:09.559
but I've seen that alcove,
and, with respect,

01:09.560 --> 01:12.160
a romantic meal for two
would be a squeeze.

01:13.100 --> 01:17.209
It's my sister's baby shower and
I need everything to be perfect.

01:17.210 --> 01:19.310
Listen, I'm coming over now.

01:21.120 --> 01:23.590
To show you
how the seating can work.

01:27.240 --> 01:29.880
Honestly, it's no trouble.
See you in a minute.

DCI Andy Steemson.
This is DS Karen Wretzky.

03:27.480 --> 03:28.999
Nikki Alexander,
pathologist.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.519
Jack Hodgson,
forensics.

03:30.520 --> 03:31.919
I know what you're thinking.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.639
It's only been 24 hours
since Lucy disappeared,

03:34.640 --> 03:36.799
but there's something
we're keeping under wraps.

03:36.800 --> 03:41.649
We got a one-second 999 call
from her mobile at 9.23am.

03:41.650 --> 03:43.499
- Nothing audible.
- Well, it should help

03:43.500 --> 03:46.159
- with the location at least.
- Only picked up on the one mast.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.279
So we can't triangulate.
No.

03:48.280 --> 03:50.199
Traces of what looks like blood

03:50.200 --> 03:52.679
and maybe fingerprints
were found here -

03:52.680 --> 03:54.879
the samples are on their way to you.

03:54.880 --> 03:57.919
Of course, it's still possible that
she walked off into the sunset,

03:57.920 --> 04:00.884
but I want to rule out that she was
taken by force from this location.

04:00.885 --> 04:03.849
I also want to rule out
that she's in this location.

04:03.850 --> 04:05.159
OK.

04:05.160 --> 04:06.969
Let me spell it out.
A missing girl.

04:06.970 --> 04:09.079
A big search party.
A media circus.

04:09.080 --> 04:11.239
Couple of days later, the body
shows up in her home,

04:11.240 --> 04:13.569
in the attic or cellar, usually.
It's been there all the time.

04:13.570 --> 04:15.609
That's not going to happen
on my watch.

04:15.610 --> 04:17.228
You want a forensic guarantee

04:17.230 --> 04:18.849
there's not a dead body
on the premises...

04:18.850 --> 04:20.279
basically?

04:20.279 --> 04:21.879
Basically, yeah.

04:21.880 --> 04:24.360
Fine. Then we'll need
the run of the house.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.440
OK.

04:29.700 --> 04:31.009
He grows on you.

04:31.010 --> 04:32.310
I look forward to it.

04:36.650 --> 04:38.050
Getting that burnt smell?

04:40.800 --> 04:44.030
This is a big place
for a primary school teacher.

04:47.760 --> 04:49.740
I'm thinking family money.

04:56.480 --> 04:58.689
Got some bike treads here.

04:58.690 --> 05:00.080
No bike.

05:40.280 --> 05:41.580
<i>Jack?</i>

05:48.560 --> 05:50.159
What is that?

05:50.160 --> 05:53.239
I think it was...
a cake.

05:53.240 --> 05:56.080
Who bakes a cake then disappears
into the sunset?

06:14.640 --> 06:16.599
Haven't you got a rehearsal?

06:16.600 --> 06:18.279
No.

06:18.280 --> 06:19.680
Want me to run you in?

06:21.200 --> 06:22.879
No.

06:22.880 --> 06:24.960
Someone got a hangover
by any chance?

06:26.440 --> 06:28.239
No.

06:28.240 --> 06:30.999
You've got two minutes.
I'll make toast to go.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.319
Dad, I've got four lines.

06:33.320 --> 06:36.369
I don't want to spend my Sunday
waiting to say them.

06:36.370 --> 06:38.879
- Please!
- Mum won't be happy.

06:38.880 --> 06:41.840
Mum's not going to remember
unless you tell her.

06:43.600 --> 06:46.280
Wow.
They're searching the lane.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.080
Think they've found her?

06:52.880 --> 06:57.089
No idea. Tell you what, though,
forget about the rehearsal.

06:57.090 --> 06:58.640
Dad, I can look after myself.

06:59.880 --> 07:01.560
Fair enough. Off you go, then.

07:39.050 --> 07:41.000
MISSING
Lucy Chatham

08:22.440 --> 08:25.029
I found a cycling app
on Lucy's laptop -

08:25.030 --> 08:26.879
it uploaded automatically

08:26.880 --> 08:31.449
and tells us she cycled 3.75 miles
on the morning she vanished.

08:31.450 --> 08:33.249
What time was it activated?

08:33.250 --> 08:34.799
Um, 9.10.

08:34.799 --> 08:37.539
So, she triggered the program
as she left her house...

08:37.539 --> 08:39.999
I'm ahead of you.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.599
Sorry.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.919
Traffic cams on the main road

08:43.919 --> 08:45.519
were checked for the morning
she went missing. No sightings? No.

08:45.520 --> 08:50.000
Leaving five
surrounding lanes and a B-road.

09:05.040 --> 09:08.580
We've got something - bang
on 3.75 miles from her house.

09:33.720 --> 09:37.559
<i>We believe Lucy left her home
in Felking, Surrey, at around 9am</i>

09:37.560 --> 09:39.149
<i>on Saturday morning</i>

09:39.150 --> 09:42.759
<i>and that she was riding
the bike in this photograph.</i>

09:42.760 --> 09:45.969
<i>Did anyone see her
in that area at that time?</i>

09:45.970 --> 09:48.179
<i>Whoever's taken my sister,</i>

09:48.180 --> 09:51.159
<i>Lucy is a good person
to her bones.</i>

09:51.160 --> 09:53.719
<i>She'd help anyone
in any situation,</i>

09:53.720 --> 09:58.420
<i>and I want her back.
I NEED her back.</i>

10:02.560 --> 10:03.860
Hello.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.640
All right, I'll be there
in 30 minutes.

10:32.400 --> 10:34.919
Hiya. Thomas Chamberlain.

10:34.920 --> 10:37.760
DS Steele. Maureen to my friends.

10:39.720 --> 10:41.020
Right.

10:44.400 --> 10:48.449
She's got track marks on both arms.
Looks like a user.

10:48.450 --> 10:49.880
Just saying.

10:56.600 --> 10:58.999
Ah! I used to have one of them!

10:59.000 --> 11:01.039
I couldn't get those
little tapes any more.

11:01.040 --> 11:03.279
Bloke on Tottenham Court Road
still sells them.

11:03.280 --> 11:05.889
Yeah? When we're done,
give me his details, would you?

11:05.890 --> 11:07.199
Gladly.

11:07.200 --> 11:10.619
Victim is female,
no apparent ID,

11:10.620 --> 11:12.119
and is lying on her back.

11:12.120 --> 11:14.839
There's a single,
penetrating wound to her chest,

11:14.840 --> 11:17.559
dusting of fine white powder
to her tracksuit.

11:17.560 --> 11:19.119
Got to be coke, right?

11:19.120 --> 11:23.350
Well, yes...
or talcum powder.

11:23.760 --> 11:27.450
Either way, she's not a primary
school teacher, that's for sure.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.709
What is it with bank
holiday weekends

11:30.710 --> 11:32.579
and girls going missing?

11:32.580 --> 11:34.359
I blame the tabloids myself.

11:34.360 --> 11:37.609
Check for a planar distribution
of any injuries in case she fell

11:37.610 --> 11:40.040
or was thrown from the road above.

11:41.880 --> 11:44.579
- Who called this in?
- Council engineer.

11:44.580 --> 11:46.999
Routine checks on the
bridge struts.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.960
He was getting back into his van
when, thank God, he found the body.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.959
If she was dumped from up there,

11:54.960 --> 11:58.329
killer's on camera one side
of the bridge or the other.

11:58.330 --> 12:02.169
Well, I'll get on with
the postmortem, if that suits.

12:02.170 --> 12:03.599
Before you do, do me a favour?

12:03.600 --> 12:06.239
- What?
- Run her prints.

12:06.240 --> 12:09.720
If she hasn't got a record
a mile long, I'll take it all back.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.800
Bike gets dragged under the car...

12:22.400 --> 12:25.529
Paint's a visual match
to Lucy's bike -

12:25.530 --> 12:27.439
manufacturer will confirm that.

12:27.440 --> 12:30.640
Now we know the road she took,
we can do targeted house-to-house...

12:41.000 --> 12:42.500
<i>Strand of hair!</i>

12:51.680 --> 12:54.719
Must've hit her at speed to send her
off the road at this height.

12:54.720 --> 12:57.049
Brake marks on the
asphalt back that up.

12:57.050 --> 12:58.440
Bastard.

12:59.240 --> 13:01.279
- Tread prints?
- Jack?

13:01.280 --> 13:05.200
We'll see, but when wheels lock up,
all you tend to get is burnt rubber.

13:11.480 --> 13:15.480
We need to search these woods now
in case she came round
and wandered off.

13:16.720 --> 13:18.319
What, you're not hopeful?

13:18.320 --> 13:20.299
That velocity and impact - no.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.279
Given that her bike
and phone are missing,

13:22.280 --> 13:25.480
it's more likely the assailant
removed her body from the scene.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.569
You'll be pleased to know
you were entirely correct.

13:59.570 --> 14:01.039
About our victim?

14:01.040 --> 14:03.639
Mm-hm. Tina Lunt, 32.

14:03.640 --> 14:07.289
Long record for theft and
possession - coke and cannabis -

14:07.290 --> 14:09.799
nothing for a couple of years,
though.

14:09.800 --> 14:12.820
She's listed as divorced,
ten-year-old son.

14:15.840 --> 14:19.369
Jack, I need you to check out
the white powder on this tracksuit.

14:19.370 --> 14:21.140
Sure.
Just leave it on my desk.

14:22.160 --> 14:24.719
Right. When do you think you might
get round to it?

14:24.720 --> 14:28.729
Er, this afternoon, the earliest.
Might need a gentle nudge.

14:28.730 --> 14:30.040
Count on it.

14:31.880 --> 14:33.969
Although both arms

14:33.970 --> 14:37.189
bear scars
suggestive of needle-use,

14:37.190 --> 14:39.789
the marks are old -

14:39.790 --> 14:42.379
months, possibly years -

14:42.380 --> 14:45.249
no evidence of recent activity.

14:45.250 --> 14:47.679
Maybe she was smoking it?

14:47.680 --> 14:49.940
Yeah,
why don't we see what tox says?

14:51.840 --> 14:56.399
There's some kind of metal object
embedded in her chest.

14:56.400 --> 14:57.740
Can you see?

14:59.320 --> 15:03.320
Clean, neat entry wound. Right.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.440
Let's have a look at it.

15:18.520 --> 15:20.120
My God.

15:24.320 --> 15:26.520
It's a fork screwdriver.

15:27.520 --> 15:30.969
The tip of the screwdriver has been
bent at a 45-degree angle.

15:30.970 --> 15:33.044
The metal is discoloured
with a mottled sheen,

15:33.045 --> 15:35.119
suggesting it's been heated
and recast.

15:35.120 --> 15:38.729
There's also, can you see,
crisscross markings on the shaft,

15:38.730 --> 15:41.420
possibly from being
clamped in a vice.

15:44.240 --> 15:45.600
Wow.

15:47.360 --> 15:50.189
You see these plastic flakes
in the wound?

15:50.190 --> 15:52.329
- Yeah.
- She was stabbed with such force,

15:52.330 --> 15:53.679
the handle broke clean off.

15:53.680 --> 15:55.649
- That's unusual?
- Very.

15:55.650 --> 15:58.009
Tool handles are made with
cellulose acetate -

15:58.010 --> 16:00.239
noted for its
extreme durability.

16:00.240 --> 16:01.860
All of which suggests

16:02.470 --> 16:03.979
it was done deliberately.

16:03.980 --> 16:06.339
And that couldn't have bent
when it struck her sternum?

16:06.340 --> 16:07.640
No.

16:09.400 --> 16:13.120
So, what kind of person needs to
modify the end of a screwdriver?

16:14.960 --> 16:18.999
Did you see or hear anything unusual
yesterday morning?

16:19.000 --> 16:21.159
Car alarm.

16:21.160 --> 16:23.999
That's right. My car alarm went off.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.849
I didn't hear it because
our bedroom faces the back.

16:26.850 --> 16:28.569
And you sleep like a donkey.

16:28.570 --> 16:29.879
That, too. Yep.

16:29.880 --> 16:32.279
It woke you up, though?

16:32.280 --> 16:34.159
I went out and checked on the car.

16:34.160 --> 16:37.409
Nothing suspicious - no indication
why it'd gone off.

16:37.410 --> 16:39.239
Has that happened before?

16:39.240 --> 16:41.279
Once or twice.
Not lately.

16:41.280 --> 16:43.120
I just turned it off.

16:44.760 --> 16:47.569
What time was that?
When you were out on the drive?

16:47.570 --> 16:50.009
It was about nine, I think.

16:50.010 --> 16:51.639
Maybe a bit after.

16:51.640 --> 16:54.639
Mr Timpson, that's exactly when we
think Lucy cycled past on the lane.

16:54.640 --> 16:56.519
You're sure you didn't see her?

16:56.520 --> 16:59.060
- Positive.
- What about a vehicle?

17:00.240 --> 17:04.240
I'm sorry. I just shut off
the alarm, went back to bed.

17:05.250 --> 17:06.888
It was my day off.

17:06.890 --> 17:08.358
What do you do?

17:08.359 --> 17:09.680
I'm a GP.

17:10.609 --> 17:11.919
You're married?

17:11.920 --> 17:14.079
My wife's in her study
if you need to speak to her.

17:14.079 --> 17:16.439
Was she around Saturday morning?

17:16.440 --> 17:18.099
She was asleep next to me.

17:19.480 --> 17:22.598
I saw someone this morning
in the lane...

17:22.599 --> 17:25.584
big guy in his 30s.
He was weird.

17:25.585 --> 17:28.569
He pulled up across the road,
just staring at the house.

17:28.569 --> 17:30.599
When he saw me, he drove off.

17:30.600 --> 17:33.279
Do you remember what kind
of car? The colour?

17:33.280 --> 17:37.969
Golf... Fiesta? That kind of thing.
Black or navy.

17:37.970 --> 17:40.909
You definitely didn't recognise him?

17:40.910 --> 17:43.639
- Why?
- Guess I'm just wondering

17:43.640 --> 17:46.390
whether he was watching the house
or watching you.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.759
Good, we got the CT scan back.

17:52.760 --> 17:55.800
Seems the shaft made an upward,

17:56.510 --> 17:58.659
diagonally-oriented chest wound,

17:58.660 --> 18:02.360
penetrated the pleural cavity here
and was cause of death.

18:08.040 --> 18:09.420
I don't get it.

18:10.220 --> 18:12.849
It must've gone through
the flesh with massive force

18:12.850 --> 18:15.069
not to tear the surrounding
skin...

18:15.070 --> 18:18.554
See these fragments of bone?
Smashed right through her sternum.

18:18.555 --> 18:22.039
So, what, we're looking for
a body-builder? A giant?

18:22.040 --> 18:25.810
Maybe to the former,
no to the latter.

18:27.360 --> 18:30.479
If you were going to stab me
with a screwdriver, DS Steele,

18:30.480 --> 18:32.199
how would you do it?

18:32.200 --> 18:34.039
Go on, show me.

18:34.040 --> 18:36.519
Yeah, classic stabbing movement.
Downward arc.

18:36.520 --> 18:39.519
But a downward arc
yields a downward wound tract.

18:39.520 --> 18:41.319
What, and we've got the opposite?

18:41.320 --> 18:45.199
Yeah. Upward trajectory - so either
our killer is three foot tall

18:45.200 --> 18:47.399
or they stabbed her from some kind
of lowered position,

18:47.400 --> 18:50.540
but that would've resulted in a far
messier entry wound.

18:52.900 --> 18:55.289
- Clarissa?
- Tox is back on Tina Lunt -

18:55.290 --> 18:57.340
clean for drugs and alcohol.

19:00.440 --> 19:03.260
Fancy a trip to her flat
in Hounslow?

19:22.800 --> 19:24.220
OK.
Thanks.

19:24.680 --> 19:26.239
Bad news?

19:26.240 --> 19:28.239
No traffic cams on the bridge.

19:28.240 --> 19:31.919
Nearest one is the other side
of a six-outlet roundabout.

19:31.920 --> 19:35.064
Oh, so, no way of telling which
vehicles went over the bridge?

19:35.065 --> 19:38.200
And they whine about us being
the CCTV capital of the world...

19:43.780 --> 19:46.239
Hang on. We should get uniforms
to sweep, shouldn't we?

19:46.240 --> 19:48.169
Sod that.

19:48.170 --> 19:49.500
Hello?

19:50.000 --> 19:51.400
Hello?

20:19.100 --> 20:20.649
Jesus! You all right?

20:20.650 --> 20:21.950
Yes. Go on!

21:16.320 --> 21:18.080
Did you get his registration
number?

21:21.100 --> 21:23.649
If you remember anything else,
please call us.

21:23.650 --> 21:24.950
Thank you.

21:32.800 --> 21:34.100
That was the police.

21:34.800 --> 21:36.100
I heard.

21:39.800 --> 21:42.880
Why did you have to tell them about
the bloody car alarm?

21:52.200 --> 21:53.799
When you turned the alarm off,

21:53.800 --> 21:55.679
was Alec's Land Rover outside?

21:55.680 --> 21:57.559
You're getting in a state
about nothing.

21:57.560 --> 21:59.399
Was it parked outside?

21:59.400 --> 22:01.239
No, I don't think so.

22:01.240 --> 22:03.519
But that doesn't mean much.

22:03.520 --> 22:05.699
He always parks beside the
guesthouse,

22:05.700 --> 22:08.200
and you can't see back there
from the drive.

22:41.880 --> 22:43.519
Find anything?

22:43.520 --> 22:47.049
Five empty beer bottles. No alcohol
in Tina's blood, remember.

22:47.050 --> 22:48.409
Could be our runner's?

22:48.410 --> 22:53.039
Yeah. What do you think?
Came back here to clean up?

22:53.040 --> 22:54.849
No sign of a mobile?

22:54.850 --> 22:56.150
No.

23:13.820 --> 23:17.060
Empty, but still a mess.
Bit like my place.

23:37.120 --> 23:38.420
DS Steele.

23:44.440 --> 23:48.849
Same crisscross markings as the one
I extracted from Tina's chest.

23:48.850 --> 23:50.250
What was she into?

23:51.160 --> 23:53.879
Something tells me our runner
might've had an inkling.

23:53.880 --> 23:55.560
All right. Don't rub it in.

24:08.090 --> 24:09.399
Christ.

24:09.400 --> 24:11.560
It's probably been like this
for days.

24:21.780 --> 24:23.209
Sell-by date tomorrow.

24:23.210 --> 24:24.510
So?

24:25.540 --> 24:27.889
So, it means he could've
been here on Friday night.

24:27.890 --> 24:29.239
Ellie...

24:29.240 --> 24:32.480
Like you said, we wouldn't know.

24:34.280 --> 24:36.920
OK, so he was here on Friday night?
So what?

24:38.560 --> 24:40.590
What are you worried about?

24:41.300 --> 24:42.600
I don't know.

24:43.720 --> 24:46.529
You can't think Alec's
got anything to do with this girl?

24:46.530 --> 24:47.860
No!

24:48.760 --> 24:50.569
No, of course not.

24:50.570 --> 24:51.900
So...?

24:52.400 --> 24:54.380
It doesn't matter what I think.

24:55.280 --> 24:58.390
If they find out about Alec,
they'll...

24:59.200 --> 25:01.480
They'll be all over him like a rash.

25:03.210 --> 25:04.510
He won't survive it,

25:06.340 --> 25:07.640
not again.

25:41.640 --> 25:43.640
Isn't this a bit excessive?

25:44.880 --> 25:46.180
I hope so.

25:49.160 --> 25:50.650
- What's going on?
- It's his coat.

25:50.960 --> 25:52.799
Just having a bit of a clear-out.

25:52.800 --> 25:55.809
That's Alec's coat.
Why are you chucking it out?

25:55.810 --> 25:58.479
It's falling apart.

25:58.480 --> 26:00.760
Jessica, please, what do you want?

26:12.600 --> 26:15.489
I'm sure your brother
can look after himself.

26:15.490 --> 26:18.440
Can he?
I'm not so sure.

26:46.320 --> 26:47.999
Is that dope?

26:48.000 --> 26:50.124
I thought the first rule of Alec
using the guesthouse was no guests,

26:50.125 --> 26:52.240
female or otherwise?

26:53.420 --> 26:54.799
Jessica.

26:54.800 --> 26:57.599
What?
How do you know?

26:57.600 --> 27:00.799
It's my lipstick.
She's always borrowing it.

27:00.800 --> 27:03.840
I'll talk to Jess.
I'm better at that stuff than you.

27:04.920 --> 27:06.820
It's not her I'm angry with.

27:33.220 --> 27:35.969
<i>Please leave
a message after the tone.</i>

27:35.970 --> 27:38.359
Alec, listen,

27:38.360 --> 27:41.369
it's very important that you don't
use the guesthouse for a bit.

27:41.370 --> 27:43.399
Don't even come to the house.

27:43.400 --> 27:46.400
I'll explain
when I speak to you.

28:01.420 --> 28:02.720
Jessica?

28:04.220 --> 28:05.759
Jessica, are you OK?

28:05.760 --> 28:07.849
Yeah. Sorry. I'll turn around.

28:07.850 --> 28:09.150
OK.

28:10.420 --> 28:13.080
<i>Just finishing up here, sir.
Yep...</i>

28:18.560 --> 28:20.040
Hey!
Watch out!

28:30.400 --> 28:31.959
Are you all right?

28:31.960 --> 28:34.140
No, I'm fine.
Yep, sorry.

33:33.880 --> 33:35.280
You didn't call me back.

33:48.760 --> 33:51.799
Want a drink or something?

33:51.800 --> 33:53.360
No, no, I'm fine.

33:59.680 --> 34:01.210
You got my message?

34:01.720 --> 34:03.080
Yes.

34:04.440 --> 34:05.960
Some girl has gone missing?

34:06.860 --> 34:10.159
Just down the road from us.
All things considered, I...

34:11.560 --> 34:13.844
I think it would be best if you...

34:13.844 --> 34:16.120
What? If I... If I stayed away?

34:17.159 --> 34:20.599
Of course. Fine. I'll stay away.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.360
OK.

34:27.560 --> 34:31.350
Last week, which night did you
stay at the guesthouse?

34:32.360 --> 34:33.659
Tuesday,

34:34.659 --> 34:37.960
Wednesday I was
panelling at the golf club...

34:40.320 --> 34:42.039
Thursday night.

34:42.040 --> 34:44.369
- Not Friday night?
- Why are you asking?

34:44.370 --> 34:46.559
The girl went missing
on Saturday morning.

34:46.560 --> 34:49.040
If they found out that you
were in the area...

34:52.179 --> 34:54.719
..we all know how quickly
they jump to conclusions.

34:54.719 --> 34:56.319
What about you, Ellie?

34:56.320 --> 34:58.369
Are you jumping to any conclusions?

34:58.370 --> 34:59.999
That is not fair, Alec.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.629
But it's true.

35:01.630 --> 35:05.139
Back then, do you think
that I would've lied for you?

35:05.140 --> 35:08.920
Do you think I would have given you
an alibi if I'd had
any doubts whatsoever?

35:11.840 --> 35:13.160
I'm sorry.

36:17.600 --> 36:18.900
Thanks.

36:39.760 --> 36:42.440
Lucy has a swallow tattoo
on her left wrist.

36:47.060 --> 36:50.869
No visible decomposition. She
can't have been in the water long.

36:50.870 --> 36:52.239
You think he dumped her today?

36:52.240 --> 36:54.049
I'd say in the last two
to four hours.

36:54.050 --> 36:55.350
He's confident.

37:01.480 --> 37:04.919
I swabbed the tool kit -
multiple prints and DNA samples,

37:04.920 --> 37:06.479
mostly belonging to Tina herself.

37:06.480 --> 37:07.799
What about the lager bottles?

37:07.800 --> 37:10.049
Well, again, multiple prints and
DNA, but only one overlapping with
the samples from the tool kit.

37:10.050 --> 37:14.010
Belonging to a Wesley Beale.

37:14.510 --> 37:18.399
His CV reads like
a criminal decathlon.

37:18.400 --> 37:20.639
That's him. That's the man I chased.

37:20.640 --> 37:22.789
You chased someone?

37:22.790 --> 37:25.409
Yeah.

37:25.410 --> 37:26.950
Is there CCTV?

37:27.690 --> 37:31.029
What have we got - blackmail,
housebreaking, drug dealing...

37:31.030 --> 37:33.159
And that's just the shit
we nicked him for.

37:33.160 --> 37:34.919
- Current address?
- No,

37:34.920 --> 37:38.949
but last time he was arrested,
he gave Maconi's car mechanics

37:38.950 --> 37:40.959
in Hounslow as his place of
employment.

37:40.960 --> 37:45.679
Owner Marc Maconi nicked
but not charged back in '04

37:45.680 --> 37:48.190
for stealing stereos
and airbags.

37:48.900 --> 37:52.420
Off-limits, I'm afraid -
as he didn't do it.

37:53.720 --> 37:56.124
Weasley Beale worked here, right?

37:56.125 --> 37:58.196
About two years ago. So what?

37:58.197 --> 38:00.260
When did you last see him?

38:01.800 --> 38:04.199
We didn't stay in touch.

38:04.200 --> 38:07.279
Aww, did you and Wesley
have a falling out?

38:07.280 --> 38:10.729
After he got busted, you lot
turned this place over for days.

38:10.730 --> 38:13.559
And that was a cause
for concern, was it?

38:13.560 --> 38:17.289
Loss of trade was my concern,
nothing else.

38:17.290 --> 38:18.989
<i>So, do you know where we might</i>

38:18.990 --> 38:20.680
<i>- find Wesley?
- No.</i>

39:16.560 --> 39:20.160
Oi! What, you lost or something?

39:22.240 --> 39:24.409
Need a warrant to be
nosing about in here.

39:24.410 --> 39:26.049
You got one?

39:26.050 --> 39:28.929
No. Well, it's trespassing,
then, innit?

39:28.930 --> 39:30.759
And if you're trespassing...

39:30.760 --> 39:32.719
If I'm trespassing, what?

39:32.720 --> 39:35.239
Then the law's on my side.

39:35.240 --> 39:37.120
Wouldn't bet on it, mate.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.300
Let's go.

39:46.040 --> 39:47.999
What was that about?

39:48.000 --> 39:49.409
You get anything on Beale?

39:49.410 --> 39:50.710
Nope.

39:54.440 --> 39:56.119
Thomas.

39:56.120 --> 39:59.969
<i>Jack. Have you checked out the
white powder </i> on that tracksuit?

39:59.970 --> 40:02.809
Sorry, haven't got to it yet.

40:02.810 --> 40:04.119
<i>Right.</i>

40:04.120 --> 40:06.119
I did say you might need
to nudge me.

40:06.120 --> 40:09.120
Yeah, well, consider this a nudge.
First and last.

40:11.820 --> 40:13.260
He hung up on me!

40:22.680 --> 40:25.600
There's a deep ligature
wound to the throat.

40:27.340 --> 40:29.629
Skin damage has released
a serum that's dried out

40:29.630 --> 40:31.909
in patches
in a parchment effect -

40:31.910 --> 40:34.879
that could be consistent
with death by strangulation.

40:34.880 --> 40:36.639
Left earlobe's torn -

40:36.640 --> 40:38.789
a wound often caused
by a snagged earring.

40:38.790 --> 40:41.390
Could've happened
when she came off the bike?

40:42.890 --> 40:44.399
Scabbing over the wound
suggests it

40:44.400 --> 40:46.900
was sustained at least
a week ago - maybe longer.

40:47.440 --> 40:49.360
We'll ask her sister about it.

40:57.920 --> 41:00.000
A clump of her hair's been cut off.

41:01.330 --> 41:02.630
Trophy?

41:37.520 --> 41:40.189
The lack of lividity and general
decomposition

41:40.190 --> 41:43.120
suggests she died
between 12 and 24 hours ago.

41:44.680 --> 41:47.320
So, where was he keeping her
since Saturday morning?

41:51.560 --> 41:55.989
Two distinct injuries to the skull.
One, here -

41:55.990 --> 41:57.640
to the side...

42:02.120 --> 42:04.690
..where we can see bark

42:06.590 --> 42:07.990
embedded in the flesh.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.040
This one's partially healed.

42:11.740 --> 42:13.639
Well, that makes sense -

42:13.640 --> 42:15.980
we know she didn't die
when he ran her down.

42:17.580 --> 42:19.640
Second head injury...

42:21.200 --> 42:23.609
..right on the back of the skull.

42:23.610 --> 42:25.400
Unhealed.

42:29.520 --> 42:34.479
And there's what look like
cement chips in this wound.

42:34.480 --> 42:38.804
So, he hits her head against a wall?
The floor?

42:38.805 --> 42:43.129
And with massive force - it staved
in the rear of her skull.

42:43.130 --> 42:45.239
Death would've been
almost instantaneous.

42:45.240 --> 42:48.609
So, what killed her? The ligature
wound or the smashed skull?

42:48.610 --> 42:50.000
I don't know.

42:51.880 --> 42:53.180
Yet.

43:15.560 --> 43:18.649
So, given the victim's criminal
history, I thought I'd start

43:18.650 --> 43:21.209
with a wet chemistry test
to see if the powder was cocaine.

43:21.210 --> 43:23.704
- Negative?
- Negative. So, I spun it down in this guy,

43:23.705 --> 43:26.199
checked it under the scope.
It's cornstarch.

43:26.200 --> 43:27.679
Cornstarch?

43:27.680 --> 43:29.119
Which is found pretty much
everywhere.

43:29.120 --> 43:31.679
But the dispersal of the powder -
not just all over the clothes

43:31.680 --> 43:34.840
but embedded in the fabric -
prompted a best guess.

43:35.760 --> 43:39.300
I think your victim was in
a car where the air bag exploded.

43:40.640 --> 43:43.009
Maconi has form for stolen airbags.

43:43.010 --> 43:44.339
That's leverage.

43:44.340 --> 43:46.079
He tells us where Beale is

43:46.080 --> 43:48.724
or we take our time turning his
garage over.

43:48.725 --> 43:51.359
Yeah, starting with that
machine room upstairs.

43:51.360 --> 43:54.439
Marks on his vice match marks on
Tina's screwdrivers.

43:54.440 --> 43:56.219
My guess is she's into air-bag theft

43:56.220 --> 43:58.560
and bent the tips to prise
them out...

44:00.120 --> 44:01.720
Always happy to help!

44:12.120 --> 44:15.479
There's no bruising in the
musculature of the neck.

44:15.480 --> 44:16.879
OK.

44:16.880 --> 44:19.659
The hyoid bone is fractured,
but there's no bleeding.

44:19.660 --> 44:20.969
And that tells you what?

44:20.970 --> 44:23.839
That the ligature wound
was inflicted after death.

44:23.840 --> 44:25.319
The skull fracture killed her?

44:25.320 --> 44:27.320
Making strangulation redundant.

44:28.920 --> 44:32.440
Maybe not.
Maybe that was the main event.

44:34.280 --> 44:36.899
I worked on
a serial case when I was a DC.

44:36.900 --> 44:39.439
The guy's thing
was posthumous mutilation.

44:39.440 --> 44:43.560
He killed his victims with
a hammer and then had his fun.

44:44.600 --> 44:47.564
He's confident,
careful and forensically aware.

44:47.565 --> 44:50.520
I'd be very surprised
if he hadn't killed before.

44:54.880 --> 44:58.909
I might be able to help
with a timeline on the injury
to Lucy's ear.

44:58.910 --> 45:00.239
How?

45:00.240 --> 45:03.680
A recent selfie.
Uploaded automatically to her cloud.

45:05.920 --> 45:07.720
Yeah.

45:08.220 --> 45:12.720
Note...there, the lovely -
but snaggable - earrings.

45:13.400 --> 45:16.079
Photo was taken nine days ago.

45:16.080 --> 45:19.729
You thought the ear injury
was over a week old.

45:19.730 --> 45:22.319
Could have just been
a sartorial mishap.

45:22.320 --> 45:24.479
But it would be nice to be sure.

45:24.480 --> 45:28.849
If you'd nothing to hide, Mr Beale,
why did you run?

45:28.850 --> 45:31.039
You never said you was police!

45:31.040 --> 45:33.329
You never gave us much chance.

45:33.330 --> 45:35.839
I didn't know who you were.

45:35.840 --> 45:38.840
Tina had a lot of dodgy mates,
God rest her soul.

45:41.120 --> 45:42.880
God rest her soul.

45:45.760 --> 45:49.689
Dumped in wasteland.
Talk about insult to injury.

45:49.690 --> 45:51.639
That's where you found her?

45:51.640 --> 45:53.319
Where is this place?

45:53.320 --> 45:55.040
I ask the questions, Wesley.

45:56.040 --> 45:58.824
Your finger prints are all over
these screwdrivers.

45:58.825 --> 46:01.600
Want to tell me what the
angled tips are about?

46:03.040 --> 46:04.419
No idea.

46:04.420 --> 46:05.780
I think

46:06.280 --> 46:09.929
they make it easier to prise the
airbags out without them deploying.

46:09.930 --> 46:12.519
That's your line of work,
isn't it?

46:12.520 --> 46:15.420
Airbags.
One of them, anyway.

46:16.440 --> 46:19.349
Well, what happened?
You and Tina have a falling out?

46:19.350 --> 46:20.909
She didn't want to do it any more?

46:20.910 --> 46:23.320
And you found another use
for your screwdrivers?

46:25.560 --> 46:27.519
You got a minute?

46:27.520 --> 46:30.599
We swept his car and his flat.

46:30.600 --> 46:33.049
There's no sign
of any air-bag residue.

46:33.050 --> 46:34.350
Shit!

46:37.360 --> 46:40.669
You said whoever killed Tina
had superhuman strength?

46:40.670 --> 46:42.399
Well, I didn't use
those precise words.

46:42.400 --> 46:45.840
Oh, whatever. He's a big bastard,
isn't he?

46:47.520 --> 46:49.320
I haven't got
a thing to hold him on.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.070
I'm sorry to put you
through this, Alice.

46:56.780 --> 46:58.080
It's OK.

47:25.680 --> 47:27.120
Look like them?

47:28.720 --> 47:30.020
They were Mum's.

47:43.080 --> 47:44.590
Is that your husband outside?

47:45.200 --> 47:47.960
Yes. He's waiting to take me home.

47:49.640 --> 47:51.740
So, Lucy lived here all by herself?

47:52.440 --> 47:53.940
You can ask.

47:54.920 --> 47:57.660
Why didn't big sister
get the big house?

47:59.000 --> 48:01.319
My parents cut me out of their will.

48:01.320 --> 48:04.219
They were worried whatever
money they left me would've gone

48:04.220 --> 48:06.080
straight up my nose.

48:08.040 --> 48:10.260
Back then, they were probably right.

48:15.080 --> 48:17.879
The blood found here
matched Lucy's DNA.

48:17.880 --> 48:20.409
Lucy told her sister
that she caught her earring

48:20.410 --> 48:22.060
on a bush getting out of a taxi.

48:23.300 --> 48:26.560
But even if the taxi didn't
drop her at the front door...

48:28.040 --> 48:30.800
Seems a stretch
she'd stumble into the bushes.

48:33.840 --> 48:35.600
So, why lie about it?

48:37.660 --> 48:39.069
We'll swab for DNA,

48:39.070 --> 48:42.009
but there's an outside chance
you won't have to wait that long.

48:42.010 --> 48:43.329
Why not?

48:43.330 --> 48:45.240
Partial print in the blood.

48:46.360 --> 48:50.440
Probably Lucy's,
but it's on the large side.

49:11.410 --> 49:12.719
Not Lucy's.

49:12.720 --> 49:14.840
Christ! That's Alice's husband.

49:17.000 --> 49:20.479
Lucy's blood. Your fingerprint.

49:20.480 --> 49:23.600
With your record, I'm thinking
you wanted drug money.

49:25.200 --> 49:28.369
When Alice's parents
cut her out of their will,

49:28.370 --> 49:30.579
Lucy promised
that she'd get her share.

49:30.580 --> 49:31.889
She reneged?

49:31.890 --> 49:34.340
They died within a month of each
other two years ago.

49:34.890 --> 49:36.289
We never saw a penny.

49:36.290 --> 49:37.999
<i>And Alice with a baby on the way.</i>

49:38.000 --> 49:41.289
<i>Exactly, and we've been clean
for more than a year.</i>

49:41.290 --> 49:42.609
<i>Both of us.</i>

49:42.610 --> 49:44.180
So, you confronted her?

49:50.120 --> 49:52.739
- What do you want, Jasper?
- Can I come in a second, please?

49:52.740 --> 49:55.019
My financial affairs
are between me and my sister.

49:55.020 --> 49:57.159
Well,
your sister's carrying my child.

49:57.160 --> 49:59.649
If she wants to play
happy families with a junkie,

49:59.650 --> 50:00.960
that's her prerogative.

50:09.000 --> 50:12.040
If... If she'd have just talked
to me in a civilised way...

50:13.680 --> 50:16.049
<i>Where were you Saturday morning?</i>

50:16.050 --> 50:18.319
<i>- At home.
- With Alice?</i>

50:18.320 --> 50:22.039
No, she had an antenatal class.

50:22.040 --> 50:23.679
You must've been
crapping yourself

50:23.680 --> 50:25.990
she'd tell Alice
what you'd done.

50:26.440 --> 50:29.199
<i>That was motive enough to shut
Lucy up,</i> and if it wasn't?

50:29.200 --> 50:32.369
Well, there's the massive sweetener
that with her gone, Alice would inherit

50:32.370 --> 50:34.489
and you'd be moved into that big
house before

50:34.490 --> 50:36.529
- the baby was born.
- That is NOT what happened.

50:36.530 --> 50:38.560
- Prove it.
- No. That's your job.

50:49.640 --> 50:53.880
Alice. There's something
you need to know about Jasper.

50:55.560 --> 50:58.759
Tell me you've got something,
please?

50:58.760 --> 51:01.079
Jasper's car tyres match

51:01.080 --> 51:03.479
the width of the brake
marks on the lane.

51:03.480 --> 51:05.724
We can compare rubber samples

51:05.725 --> 51:07.960
all day long, but it's not DNA.

51:11.360 --> 51:13.559
What does he do?
Jasper?

51:13.560 --> 51:15.239
He taught creative writing.

51:15.240 --> 51:17.239
- Interesting.
- Why?

51:17.240 --> 51:18.549
Well, if you're right about him,

51:18.550 --> 51:21.620
we could be looking at some
very creative staging.

51:22.120 --> 51:24.939
He runs Lucy down
but she doesn't die.

51:24.940 --> 51:27.749
He doesn't have the stomach
to kill her with his bare hands,

51:27.750 --> 51:30.559
so he keeps her somewhere
while he summons the courage.

51:30.560 --> 51:31.869
When it comes to disposal,

51:31.870 --> 51:35.314
he does everything he can
to suggest a psychosexual motive.

51:35.315 --> 51:38.769
The severed hair, the body left
naked, the posthumous strangulation.

51:38.770 --> 51:40.719
All misdirection.

51:40.720 --> 51:44.879
He is arrogant enough to try that
on, but I need more than theories.

51:44.880 --> 51:48.049
If it wasn't for the water we would
know more about where he kept her.

51:48.050 --> 51:51.569
There is one place that we
haven't looked. Her turbinates.

51:51.570 --> 51:53.099
The cavities in her nose.

51:53.100 --> 51:56.109
Not usually examined at PM,
but they can trap material

51:56.110 --> 51:58.570
not detectable
elsewhere on the body.

53:17.050 --> 53:18.359
Listen, please...

53:18.360 --> 53:20.719
There's nothing
I want to hear you say.

53:20.720 --> 53:22.759
She was never going to give us
the money. Never.

53:22.760 --> 53:24.599
I-I was thinking of our baby!

53:24.600 --> 53:26.240
My baby!

53:28.840 --> 53:31.239
I ran the washings
from Lucy Chatham's turbinates -

53:31.240 --> 53:34.999
nothing out of the ordinary
except trace levels of cornstarch.

53:35.000 --> 53:36.599
Cornstarch?

53:36.600 --> 53:37.900
What?

53:42.560 --> 53:44.800
Thomas!
You're going to want to see this.

53:46.080 --> 53:48.839
What is it?
What's this sample from?

53:48.840 --> 53:52.269
This is cornstarch
found on their victim, Tina Lunt.

53:52.270 --> 53:54.559
- As you know, I think it's from an air bag.
- Yeah, and...?

53:54.560 --> 53:59.409
And Clarissa's just retrieved
cornstarch powder
from Lucy Chatham's turbinates.

53:59.410 --> 54:01.019
The samples are identical.

54:01.020 --> 54:03.369
Hang on, hang on...
If they are from airbags,

54:03.370 --> 54:05.759
then surely hundreds are deployed
every day, yeah?

54:05.760 --> 54:08.219
But the majority have
silicate filling, not cornstarch.

54:08.220 --> 54:10.999
What are the chances of two women
being murdered within a day

54:11.000 --> 54:15.369
of each other coming into contact
with the same cornstarch powder?

54:15.370 --> 54:16.719
Bloody slim, I'd say.

54:16.720 --> 54:18.039
We're working the same case.

54:18.040 --> 54:20.599
Do you have a suspect in your case?

54:20.600 --> 54:22.920
Listen...
I'm not stupid.

54:24.160 --> 54:28.359
When nice people like you don't
call the police, that's unusual.

54:28.360 --> 54:32.040
When you start moving dead bodies,
that's just plain weird.

54:33.580 --> 54:36.920
I don't want an explanation.
I just want paying.

57:36.320 --> 57:38.679
If is the same killer,
it learn fast.

57:38.680 --> 57:41.769
We know from Lucy that you blow up
when things don't go your way.

57:41.770 --> 57:43.329
Is that what happened to Beale?

57:43.330 --> 57:45.880
You were found innocent, so why did
you change your name?

57:47.060 --> 57:49.889
And I know her well enough
to know when she's lying.

57:49.890 --> 57:51.899
I think they've seen each other.

57:51.900 --> 57:54.159
It's very important you don't take
any more calls, Jess.

57:54.160 --> 57:56.179
The police will be tracking
your phone. What...?

57:56.180 --> 57:59.529
It's our worst decisions
that define us, Nikki -

57:59.530 --> 58:01.689
they're the ones we have to live by.
