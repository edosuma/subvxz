choices for their kids?

10:49.160 --> 10:52.425
You know what? Parents don't
always know what they're dOIng.

10:52.520 --> 10:53.862
SO I get a gun?

10:53.960 --> 10:56.144
(CHUCKLES)
Pick your own name.

10:56.760 --> 10:58.022
What do you wanna be called?

10:58.320 --> 11:00.345
Take your time.
It's a big decision.

11:02.640 --> 11:05.461
All right, you ready to learn some
self-defense with Auntie Dutch?

11:05.600 --> 11:07.181
You know, your dad's
got some moves too.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.860
Make me look gOOd
in front of the kid.

11:13.080 --> 11:14.104
COOI!

11:14.200 --> 11:16.304
Yeah, see? Fun.

11:16.400 --> 11:17.788
I'll take it from here, Papa.

11:18.040 --> 11:20.304
Oh, thanks for that.

11:20.440 --> 11:21.862
Really nice.

11:22.520 --> 11:23.862
(DOOR CHIMES)

11:24.520 --> 11:26.067
(awe-some) Hello!

11:29.200 --> 11:31.623
Oh. You're not
what I ordered.

11:33.720 --> 11:36.382
Hi. Maybe we can
work something out.

11:36.680 --> 11:38.261
Sure thing, friend.

11:38.640 --> 11:41.097
Oh, I don't
kiss on the mouth.

11:45.760 --> 11:49.218
JOhn says you can kick someone's ass
without even being in the same room.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.267
Am I gonna learn that?

11:51.520 --> 11:53.579
Training starts
with a solid defense.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.581
What about leather pants?

11:55.680 --> 11:57.341
Shouldn't training start
with leather pants?

11:57.440 --> 11:58.543
Focus.

11:58.920 --> 12:00.501
Let's see what you can do.

12:00.800 --> 12:03.667
Lesson one, always be aware
Of your surroundings.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.465
Tell me what weapons
are in this room.

12:07.240 --> 12:08.343
Um...

12:08.440 --> 12:09.429
Your gun,

12:09.520 --> 12:11.101
your knife...
"Knives."

12:12.200 --> 12:13.622
Where do you keep them?

12:14.200 --> 12:17.829
There are at least 16 more weapons
in this room that can kill or maim.

12:18.520 --> 12:20.545
The chairs, your belt,

12:20.640 --> 12:22.267
even that cloth
over your eyes.

12:23.240 --> 12:26.141
An
assassin sees everything as
a weapon, and you
need to
know

12:26.240 --> 12:28.105
if someone's gonna use one
against you.

12:31.120 --> 12:33.497
Tell me where I am.
What am I doing?

12:33.840 --> 12:35.228
At the table.

12:36.840 --> 12:38.182
Moving the chairs.

12:39.600 --> 12:41.659
Near that pile Of chain.

12:43.760 --> 12:45.148
Now the ladder.

12:45.560 --> 12:46.879
Not bad.

12:47.680 --> 12:48.999
(CHAIN FALLS)

12:52.400 --> 12:53.719
You can't get distracted.

12:54.360 --> 12:56.100
You need to be able
to hear that sound

12:56.200 --> 12:58.384
in a crowded room and instantly
know you're in danger.

13:00.120 --> 13:02.463
Now let's get ready
for some real world training.

13:16.480 --> 13:19.665
DUTCH:
That's the memory Kh/yen gave
me of the assassin at the Tenyer.

13:25.440 --> 13:26.702
Hello, friend.

13:30.560 --> 13:33.825
There's a white dwarf in the Plazinski
system, but it's not big enough

13:33.920 --> 13:35.706
for this much_ _
electromagnetIc radIatlon.

13:36.480 --> 13:38.744
Hey, Zeph, can I get you
up here for an Opinion?

13:40.040 --> 13:41.302
Luce?

13:41.640 --> 13:43.221
You got eyes on Zeph?
Is she with Pip?

13:43.320 --> 13:45.902
LUCY: She is, but neither of
them are currently on-board.

13:46.280 --> 13:48.657
Zeph took P/p
on the Black Root ship.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.506
You didn't think
to mention that?

13:50.640 --> 13:52.949
Zeph instructed me not to,
but she left a message.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.623
(L UCY RECITJNG

13:55.720 --> 13:57.506

14:05.640 --> 14:08.017
”Okay, Zephyr out. ”
Damn w, Zeph.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.500
D'av, look, I think that
she's right on this one.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.659
She sprung my baby/flapper-

14:13.760 --> 14:16.217
And took him far away from your kid.
That's the best way to protect him.

14:16.320 --> 14:17.537
NO Pip, nO problem.
NO.

14:17.640 --> 14:20.859
Hey, hey! Just slow your roll, Papa Bear.
Your kid is safe,

14:20.960 --> 14:22.461
especially if he's getting
trained by Dutch,

14:22.560 --> 14:24.221

14:25.520 --> 14:26.509
(SIGHS IN EXASPERATION)

14:26.880 --> 14:28.199
He's been alive for two days,

14:28.280 --> 14:30.862
and I haven't stopped worrying
about him for a Single second.

14:31.680 --> 14:32.999
Ijust... l...

14:33.320 --> 14:34.947
I don't know how tO Dad.

14:36.120 --> 14:38.338
An entire human being
just parachuted into my life,

14:38.480 --> 14:39.868
and I'm responsible for him.

14:39.960 --> 14:42.702
I get why you're worried, but
come on, D'av, you got this,

14:42.800 --> 14:44.427
'cause you were
a great dad tO me,

14:46.120 --> 14:49.021
although you did abandon me and
get me stabbed, mule kicked,

14:49.120 --> 14:50.508
semi-Hullenized.

14:51.760 --> 14:53.227
TOO soon?
Yeah, probably.

14:53.320 --> 14:54.503
Sorry.

14:54.640 --> 14:57.143
MANO:
I’ve got an
update, John-
ManO?

14:57.440 --> 15:00.147
I need to talk to you.
It's urgent.

15:00.240 --> 15:02.617
I told you, I'm not
selling you any memories

15:02.720 --> 15:04.142
for your creepsters.

15:04.240 --> 15:06.105
Like being able tO tell my
gOOd soars from the bad ones.

15:06.360 --> 15:09.545
I got a hit back on that photo
you ran through the database,

15:09.640 --> 15:11.983
but it's not a conversation
for over comms.

15:12.320 --> 15:13.742
JOHN: AH r/ght;
Days on his way.

15:13.840 --> 15:14.864
Hurry.

15:25.560 --> 15:26.743
All right.

15:27.360 --> 15:31.581
I think we're far enough away from
Lucy, in case this doesn't work.

15:31.680 --> 15:35.184
There's nowhere you can escape to,
unless you kill me and take the Ship.

15:35.280 --> 15:36.599
Zeph, I would never.

15:36.680 --> 15:37.863
You tried to steal D'av'S kid.

15:37.960 --> 15:39.621
It's not like I succeeded.

15:39.720 --> 15:41.347
Idon't even _
remember dOIng It.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.067
I knew it,
because it wasn't you.

15:43.160 --> 15:44.582
Thank you.
It was the spider.

15:44.680 --> 15:46.307
Right. What?

15:47.920 --> 15:49.581
Spider? What spider?
What are you talking about?

15:49.680 --> 15:51.147
Oh.

15:51.400 --> 15:56.463
Um, there's an itty-bitty giant
green spider in your brain.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.659
A Spider?
Yeah.

15:58.760 --> 16:00.341
Is-is it moving?
Have you seen it?

16:00.480 --> 16:02.459
Is it alive? IS it moving?
It's moving, isn't it?

16:02.560 --> 16:05.461
I can feel its creepy little legs
crawling around in my brain.

16:05.560 --> 16:08.779
It's that dark Spider-looking
spot there.

16:09.600 --> 16:10.942
How'd it get in there?

16:11.040 --> 16:13.258
Oh. Uh, my guess?

16:13.360 --> 16:15.499
Eyes, ears, nose, mouth.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.579
I suppose there are
other Options,

16:17.680 --> 16:18.669
but it's a longer route
to the brain, so...

16:18.760 --> 16:19.749
Nope.

16:20.160 --> 16:22.264
It's wrapped around
your medulla oblongata.

16:22.360 --> 16:26.137
That controls autonomic functions,
controls you without you even knowing it.

16:26.600 --> 16:27.919
How are you gonna get it out?

16:28.000 --> 16:30.377
Well, the Green
is still frozen,

16:31.320 --> 16:32.947
so we're gonna have
to gO Old school.

for a bath, friend,

formally introduced.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.300
and no one likes you.

17:01.480 --> 17:02.742
Especially me.

17:04.520 --> 17:05.839
Remember me?

17:05.960 --> 17:07.666
Oh, goodie, you do.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.546
And do you remember
what you did to him, friend?

17:09.640 --> 17:11.346
Ishot him.

17:11.480 --> 17:12.504
Mmm.

17:12.600 --> 17:15.057
And can you guess what that
means he wants to do to you?

17:15.440 --> 17:17.817
Probably something pretty bad.

17:17.920 --> 17:18.989

17:19.080 --> 17:22.186
And what that angry,
scary man wants to dO to you

17:22.360 --> 17:24.464
is sunshine and
gods damn puppies

17:24.560 --> 17:26.619
compared to what
I will do to you

17:26.720 --> 17:28.699
if you don't tell me what the
hells you did with my husband.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.119
I didn't take nobody!

17:30.480 --> 17:34.029
I just find the houses with the
kids, and then I mark the doors.

17:34.760 --> 17:36.864
Then they come to take them.

17:39.360 --> 17:40.622
What do the Hullen
want with kids?

17:40.720 --> 17:41.789
I don't know.
Where do they take them?

17:41.880 --> 17:43.222
I don't know.

17:43.320 --> 17:44.537
Why did they take Gared?

17:44.640 --> 17:46.062
They think
he knew something.

17:46.160 --> 17:47.741
They tOOk him
to be interrogated.

17:47.840 --> 17:49.740
Hmm. Well, puddin',

17:50.360 --> 17:52.920
everyone knows that I do the
singing in our relationship.

17:56.120 --> 17:58.782
Oh, gods! What do
you want from me?

17:58.880 --> 17:59.983
This.

(WHIMPERING)

18:06.520 --> 18:07.942
Oh.

18:09.760 --> 18:11.978
You didn't have to make him think
you were gonna cut It Off.

18:12.080 --> 18:13.627
He didn't have tO shoot me.

Hey...

18:49.800 --> 18:51.017
What did I say?

18:51.840 --> 18:54.024
Lesson one, always be aware
Of your surroundings.

18:54.120 --> 18:55.439
You can't get distracted.

18:55.680 --> 18:56.897
I know. I know.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.627
We've been doing this
for hours.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.824
I know, but you're not
getting any better.

19:01.440 --> 19:02.577
Lesson two,

19:04.240 --> 19:07.983
never assume your attacker
only has one weapon.

19:08.640 --> 19:10.107
Where were you
keeping that?

19:11.240 --> 19:12.946
You need
to take this seriously.

19:13.680 --> 19:15.864
This is the difference
between life and death.

19:15.960 --> 19:19.020
When The Lady makes her move, the
Hullen are gonna come for you fast,

19:19.120 --> 19:20.860
and they're gonna
come for you hard.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.099
(MUFFLED) You can't let
your guard down.

19:24.640 --> 19:26.949
What did I just literally
say about distractions?

How did you do that?
I don't know.

Next lesson, camouflage.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.461
Should we get some lunch
while we're here?

20:08.800 --> 20:10.825

to (GASPS) hide.

20:28.120 --> 20:29.508
Fifty joy to watch, guys.

20:29.600 --> 20:32.387
How about 100
to clear out?

20:32.480 --> 20:33.697
Fast.

20:37.040 --> 20:38.382
Out.

20:40.880 --> 20:42.063
Out.

20:43.720 --> 20:47.269
Okay, we need a secure place tO hole
up until I can get us some backup.

20:49.720 --> 20:51.381
Why would anyone
pay to see that?

20:51.960 --> 20:53.621
Was it some kind of
fight training?

20:54.200 --> 20:55.906
D’av, Johnny, are you there’?

20:56.000 --> 20:58.707
Seems like a really ineffective
way to attack someone unless...

20:58.800 --> 21:00.620
Damn it, why aren't
they responding?

21:01.040 --> 21:02.541
D’av’? Johnny’?

21:02.640 --> 21:04.107
Will I be getting training
with this too?

21:05.000 --> 21:07.867
Okay, listen to me, kid,

21:07.960 --> 21:10.667
we have a killer on our asses,
and I can't find the Jaqobis.

21:10.880 --> 21:13.542
I have nO time tO tell you
where babies come from.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.346
That's where
babies come from?

21:15.600 --> 21:17.067
Is that where I came from?

21:17.160 --> 21:20.140
But I have two moms, so does that
mean there's two women or...

21:20.240 --> 21:22.379
You're gonna have to ask
your dad about that one.

21:24.120 --> 21:25.781
If we ever find him.

21:26.560 --> 21:28.824
LUCY: I’ve completed my
search of all known pulsars

21:28.920 --> 21:30.660
in all known databases, John.

21:30.760 --> 21:32.580
Tell me how brilliant
you are, Luce.

21:32.680 --> 21:36.138
My intell/gence cannot be accurately
expressed in human terms.

21:36.920 --> 21:39.138
You found my pulsar,
didn't you, girl?

21:39.240 --> 21:41.879

Well, that's Khlyen.

You can count on him
for the cushy milk runs.

21:49.200 --> 21:50.622
DA l/lN: Johnny,
you there?

21:50.720 --> 21:53.223
We ’ve
got
a
problem.
JOHN: Is the problem you?

21:53.320 --> 21:55.424
Because damn, D'av,
you sound like balls.

21:55.520 --> 21:58.546
Yeah, that's because Mano's dead,
and I got jumped at his place.

21:58.640 --> 22:00.585
Shit. Hullen?

22:00.680 --> 22:03.422
I don't know what he was,
except mean and ugly.

22:03.640 --> 22:05.540
Where's Dutch?
I keep tryIng her on her com.

22:05.640 --> 22:07.187
She took the kid
to Utopia Square.

22:07.280 --> 22:09.737
Dutch, you better grab the kid
and beat it back tO Lucy.

22:09.840 --> 22:11.740
LUCY: Dutch ’5 comms
have been disabled John.

22:12.040 --> 22:13.177
By What?

22:13.280 --> 22:14.986
D’avin 55 P00.

22:17.120 --> 22:19.577
That sneaky freaking
Hullen, he took it.

22:19.680 --> 22:21.580
JOHN: And used it
to remote access our network

22:21.680 --> 22:23.705
and isolate Dutch's location
and sever her comms.

22:23.880 --> 22:26.019
Johnny, that's my kid
and Dutch out there.

22:26.120 --> 22:27.542
If he finds them
before we dO...

22:27.640 --> 22:30.347
I'm on it. If Mr. "Bad Guy"
can use your PDD to track us,

22:30.440 --> 22:32.260
then we can use it
to track him.

22:34.160 --> 22:37.823
SO who actually has the baby? Does
it depend on who wins the fight?

22:38.120 --> 22:39.940
Hey, it's Okay to be scared.

22:40.040 --> 22:41.428
I know, but I'm not.

22:42.600 --> 22:43.624
Back in the square,

22:43.720 --> 22:45.426
how did you know
we were gonna get attacked?

22:45.600 --> 22:47.340
I can't explain it.
I just knew.

22:48.320 --> 22:51.778
Sometimes, I just know things.

22:54.680 --> 22:56.227
DO you know
the last time I was afraid?

22:56.560 --> 22:58.380
It was when I found out
where I came from.

22:59.800 --> 23:02.109
Was it some of this
gnarly traInIng stuff?

23:02.200 --> 23:03.224
NO.

23:03.960 --> 23:05.825
But was pretty messed up.

23:06.160 --> 23:08.720
Look, I'm used to being lied to,
so I'm gonna tell you the truth.

23:10.520 --> 23:13.739
Your other mother,
Aneela, made you.

23:14.080 --> 23:15.502
Why? For what?

23:15.600 --> 23:18.239
I don't know yet, and a lot
Of people wanna find out.

23:18.560 --> 23:20.744
That's why you need to be
able to protect yourself.

23:23.160 --> 23:25.219
Does this mean
I don't have a family?

23:27.240 --> 23:28.423
You have us.

23:34.200 --> 23:35.747
What are those?
Grenades.

23:35.840 --> 23:38.058
Oh, Shit.
We gotta get out of here!

23:38.160 --> 23:39.479
But these aren't live.

23:39.760 --> 23:41.261
N .
0, no, no, It's a trap!

23:44.200 --> 23:46.464
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

23:47.720 --> 23:50.666
You're not taking that kid.
Oh, I'm not here for him.

23:51.440 --> 23:53.226
Rescue party for two!

23:53.960 --> 23:56.144
Step away from my kid,
or your skull gets a sunroof.

23:56.480 --> 23:57.697
DUTCH: Dev,
don't kill him.

24:01.160 --> 24:02.184
Damn it!

24:02.760 --> 24:03.784
Take him to Lucy!

24:03.920 --> 24:05.103
Hey-

24:05.200 --> 24:06.701
Are you Okay?
Are you hurt?

24:07.040 --> 24:08.826
I'm good.
Come on.

24:08.920 --> 24:10.308
Let's go.

24:15.200 --> 24:16.667
Should I smell
burning toast?

24:16.800 --> 24:17.869
Um...

24:17.960 --> 24:19.063
Maybe in a sec.

24:20.360 --> 24:22.817
Charging in five, four...

24:22.920 --> 24:24.626
(MACHINE WHIRRING)

24:30.880 --> 24:32.097
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

24:33.320 --> 24:35.220
(GROANING)

24:35.320 --> 24:36.537
That wasn't toast.

24:37.280 --> 24:39.464
Dang it, I don't know
how to kill this thing.

24:39.560 --> 24:41.460
Maybe a higher voltage
Of electricity?

24:41.840 --> 24:43.865
Okay, I know that
I Shouldn't be squeamish

24:44.000 --> 24:45.661
because I almostjust
permanently lost control

24:45.760 --> 24:47.261
Of my bowels there
for a second,

24:47.360 --> 24:50.147
but the idea Of a dead spider
floating around in my brain

24:50.240 --> 24:51.377
isn't exactly...

24:51.480 --> 24:53.266
(MACHINE WHIRRING)

25:07.000 --> 25:08.945
(BOTH PANTING)

25:09.800 --> 25:11.119
Yeah.

25:11.600 --> 25:14.626
Dead spider. Works.

25:15.120 --> 25:16.587
I don't know, Pip,

25:17.160 --> 25:19.503
the only thing left tO try
is sonic frequency.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.139
Whatever it takes,
as long as you kill it.

25:22.320 --> 25:23.708
That's the thing.

25:24.280 --> 25:25.599
I don't know if I can.

25:26.200 --> 25:27.747
The spider is so entwined...

25:27.880 --> 25:30.019
Zeph, if you don't kill it, you'll
never be able to trust me again.

25:31.600 --> 25:33.306
I betrayed you.

25:34.480 --> 25:37.779
I betrayed you. All Of you.

25:37.880 --> 25:40.940
And as long as this thing
is alive inside my head,

25:41.040 --> 25:43.065
you're going to be afraid
that I'm gonna dO it again.

25:45.880 --> 25:49.065
Now, whether we ever become
anything more or not,

25:49.160 --> 25:51.344
I want you tO trust me.

25:52.560 --> 25:53.879
Okay?

25:57.440 --> 25:58.759
SO we keep going,

25:59.520 --> 26:00.942
until it's dead,

26:02.080 --> 26:03.502
no matter what.

26:05.880 --> 26:07.199
Okay-

26:10.280 --> 26:13.022
Hitting this Spider
with sonic frequency

26:13.120 --> 26:14.223
in three,

26:15.480 --> 26:16.697
two...

26:20.160 --> 26:22.185
(ALARM BLARING)

26:28.760 --> 26:31.820
We lost him. Whoever that
asshole IS, he's Slepery.

26:31.920 --> 26:33.308
Lucy's fired up
and ready to go.

26:33.400 --> 26:34.981
Let's get out of here
before he comes back

26:35.120 --> 26:36.462
with his little Huflenffiends.
He's not Hullen.

26:36.560 --> 26:37.697
He didn't heal
when you Shot him.

26:37.800 --> 26:38.869
Well, then
who the hells is he?

26:38.960 --> 26:41.463
I don't know, but he had
this tattooed on his neck.

26:42.600 --> 26:44.465
And he's gonna give us
some answers.

26:49.200 --> 26:51.543
I have to admit, for being The
Lady's number one most wanted...

26:51.640 --> 26:52.743
Numbers one through three.

26:52.880 --> 26:54.097
I meant my kid.

26:54.280 --> 26:57.579
Can't decide if I'm relieved or insulted
that she only sent one guy after us.

26:57.840 --> 26:59.740
When you send someone like
that, you only need one.

26:59.840 --> 27:01.057
He's a pro.

27:01.160 --> 27:02.422
He should honor
the assaSSIn's code.

27:02.520 --> 27:04.784
You guys have a code?
Like, with rules?

27:04.960 --> 27:06.348
Ooh. IS there a handshake?

27:06.440 --> 27:08.226
There's only one ritual
we respect.

27:08.560 --> 27:09.549
The White Blade.

27:09.640 --> 27:11.301
It should buy us a sit-down
and get us some answers.

27:11.440 --> 27:14.659
All right, I remote-activated
an audiO channel on D'av'S PDD.

27:14.760 --> 27:16.819
You now have a one way mic
to your "assasshole" friend.

27:16.920 --> 27:18.626
(FEEDBACK)
Ooh!

27:18.720 --> 27:20.381
And now
you have his attention.

27:22.880 --> 27:24.620
Listen up, you bastard,

27:25.120 --> 27:26.701
this is
a profeSSIonal courtesy.

27:27.360 --> 27:29.544
I'm invoking a White Blade.

27:30.040 --> 27:32.702
Utopia Square, 0600.

27:33.320 --> 27:34.503
You know the drill.

27:34.600 --> 27:36.147
I'll recon logistics
for backup.

27:36.240 --> 27:38.504
NO. Whoever this guy is,
he's good.

27:38.600 --> 27:41.023
He'll spot you right away and
bail, and we get nothing.

27:41.560 --> 27:42.982
I gO alone.

27:43.080 --> 27:44.502
We'll be standing by
on comms.

27:44.960 --> 27:46.348
With guns.

28:01.280 --> 28:02.702
(DOOR SLAMS OPEN)

28:04.280 --> 28:05.622
Oopsie, boys.

28:05.720 --> 28:07.221
Were you looking
for children?

28:07.400 --> 28:08.617
I'm young at heart.

28:09.320 --> 28:11.629
And lucky you, I know which
kid you're looking for

28:11.720 --> 28:13.062
and where tO find him,

28:13.400 --> 28:14.981
if you ask nicely.

28:31.760 --> 28:33.022
ShOkkun.

28:33.360 --> 28:34.463
Very nice.

28:34.800 --> 28:35.789
Carbon?

28:36.200 --> 28:38.179
Daisan. Bone.

28:38.880 --> 28:40.825
It's always a pleasure tO work
with a professional.

28:41.240 --> 28:42.707
Nice jacket; by the way.

28:42.800 --> 28:45.587
Probably a bad idea to trust
an assassin's honor, right?

28:45.680 --> 28:47.500
I mean,
we live with one.

28:47.600 --> 28:50.706
She's my BFF and your
sort Of memory baby mama,

28:50.800 --> 28:52.062
so it's not that
big Of a leap.

28:52.560 --> 28:56.018
Your 15 minutes
starts now.

28:56.120 --> 28:58.429
Who are you and what the
hells do you want with us?

28:58.520 --> 29:00.226
I could ask
the same of you.

29:00.320 --> 29:02.140
Well, isn't this
a blind date.

29:02.280 --> 29:05.704
You're the one making all the noise
looking for a colleague of ours.

29:06.560 --> 29:07.948
The assassin.

29:09.440 --> 29:10.907
I thought we were
quiet about that.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.707
My associates prefer
things tO be Silent.

29:14.200 --> 29:15.542
And whO_ would
your aSSOCIates be?

29:15.640 --> 29:17.141
Bit Of a family business.

29:17.640 --> 29:20.939
My father was a protector,
and his father before him.

29:21.040 --> 29:24.589
Kind Of a legacy deal,
a divine calling.

29:24.680 --> 29:26.022
Protector Of what?

29:26.160 --> 29:29.584
All you need to know is that
we take it very seriously.

29:30.560 --> 29:32.744
It began hundreds Of years
before you were born,

29:32.840 --> 29:36.219
and it will continue
centurIes after you are dust.

29:36.320 --> 29:40.381
Well, I'm a here-and-now kind Of girl, and
if your people are trying to kill me,

29:40.480 --> 29:42.186
that's a right-now
kind Of problem.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.100
I'm afraid I can't
help you with that.

29:44.720 --> 29:46.062
Divine calling and all.

29:46.160 --> 29:47.377
Calling to what?

29:49.240 --> 29:50.662
Does it have something
to dO with your tattoo?

29:50.760 --> 29:52.341
Because I've seen
that symbol before.

29:53.080 --> 29:55.662
Where have you seen it?
NO.

29:55.760 --> 29:57.819
Not until you tell me
who you work for.

29:59.800 --> 30:00.937
Where?

30:02.720 --> 30:04.506
(WHISPERS)
It's The Lady, isn't it?

30:07.080 --> 30:08.581
This White Blade

30:10.120 --> 30:11.337
is over.

30:13.160 --> 30:15.378
Yeah, you were right.
Bad idea to trust an assassin.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.186
Lucy, watch the kid
while we're gone.

30:17.280 --> 30:18.986
LUCY: He ’5 not
currently aboard D’av.

30:19.480 --> 30:21.345
I love you, girl,
but we need to talk

30:21.440 --> 30:23.101
about monitoring
entrances and exits.

30:23.200 --> 30:25.907
I do monitor, John. I know
exactly when the boy leit.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.979
Skip tO where the hells
he is now.

30:56.640 --> 30:57.629
(GRU NTS)

31:01.320 --> 31:02.309
(GRU NTS)

31:02.400 --> 31:03.719
Lesson two,

31:03.840 --> 31:06.547
never assume your Opponent
has only one weapon.

31:07.480 --> 31:09.266
What the hells
are you doing here?

31:09.880 --> 31:13.384
Kicking his ass, saving your
ass, all Of the ass stuff.

31:24.640 --> 31:26.540
D'AVIN: It's one thing for Dutch
to gO to a White Blade alone.

31:26.640 --> 31:27.629
She can handle herself,

31:27.720 --> 31:29.426
but you have barely
had a day Of training.

31:29.520 --> 31:30.782
Excellent training.

31:32.440 --> 31:34.465
Did you see the part where
ljabbed him in the neck,

31:34.560 --> 31:36.061
like, "Eat tranq, dirt-face!"

31:36.160 --> 31:37.627
Junior, I am
lecturing here.

31:37.720 --> 31:40.029
You tOOk a hells Of a gamble
sneaking off into that parlay,

31:40.120 --> 31:41.382
and you're lucky it paid off

31:41.480 --> 31:43.027
and the three of us were
there in case it didn't.

31:43.120 --> 31:45.463
Look, he's my memory
nephew-brother-son.

31:45.560 --> 31:47.141
He might be a natural.

31:47.520 --> 31:49.260
I was scared,
but I did what you said.

31:50.040 --> 31:51.177
I just kept 90mg-

31:52.400 --> 31:53.469
Dutch...

31:54.600 --> 31:57.239
Yes, your dad's right.
It was very dangerous,

31:57.320 --> 31:59.538
and I had it all under
control, blah, blah, blah.

31:59.640 --> 32:01.426
But you did great

32:02.440 --> 32:04.783
because you had a kickass
teacher, and you're a Jaqobis,

32:05.280 --> 32:07.419
and JaqobiS men
never let me down.

32:09.760 --> 32:11.387
GO clean up.

32:15.560 --> 32:19.303
Oh, come on, D'avin, don't be so jealous
that the chip Off your old block

32:19.400 --> 32:21.106
wants to be more
like Auntie Dutch.

32:21.200 --> 32:22.701
I want him to live long
enough to be his own block.

32:22.800 --> 32:24.267
With my training, he will.

32:26.560 --> 32:27.549
(SIGHS)

32:29.480 --> 32:31.459
Damn, Grandma,
you been working out?

32:31.560 --> 32:34.302
Okay, the sonic
definitely did some damage.

32:39.560 --> 32:40.629
What's happening?

32:42.240 --> 32:43.309
Did you kill it?

32:43.440 --> 32:44.509
NO.

32:44.920 --> 32:46.740
But the frequency did disrupt
the Spider's connection

32:46.840 --> 32:48.387
to your impulse control
functions.

32:48.480 --> 32:50.789
You aren't
The Lady's Pippet anymore.

32:50.880 --> 32:53.622
Damn it, Zeph,
I said that I wanted it dead.

32:53.720 --> 32:55.221
I trust you, Pip,

32:58.600 --> 33:00.625
even with a spider
in your brain.

33:02.440 --> 33:04.180
Killing it meant
killing you too.

33:04.280 --> 33:05.907
It's fused
with your medulla oblongata.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.662
It's literally part of the
system keeping you alive now.

33:09.600 --> 33:12.421
SO, what,
if the Spider dies, then...

33:16.640 --> 33:17.777
Huh.

33:17.880 --> 33:19.381
It's not "huh."
It's shit.

33:19.480 --> 33:22.040
But it definitely
can't control me anymore?

33:23.680 --> 33:24.942
Okay-

33:25.800 --> 33:28.621
WeH,lguess
I'm part spider now.

33:29.760 --> 33:31.500
Weird, yes.

33:31.600 --> 33:33.227
Icky, definitely.

33:33.320 --> 33:35.538
But you've been fine
with my other proclivities,

33:35.640 --> 33:38.097
so I'm sure we'll get
through this somehow.

33:42.720 --> 33:44.187
Unless there's more?

33:46.120 --> 33:48.384
These spiders weren't
meant to survive long

33:48.480 --> 33:49.697
outside the Green.

33:49.840 --> 33:52.422
They seem to have a rapid

33:53.640 --> 33:54.629
half-life.

33:54.760 --> 33:58.309
Okay, SO I won't have to worry about
the Spider controlling me for long

33:58.400 --> 34:00.379
because it's gonna die?

34:00.480 --> 34:04.302
And Since it's the only thing
keeping me alive... Shit.

34:04.400 --> 34:06.027
We're going tO the Armada.

34:06.360 --> 34:08.703
Aneela's lab is there,
and we'll find a way, Pip.

34:09.880 --> 34:11.097
How long?

34:18.760 --> 34:20.148
I'll find a way.

34:26.360 --> 34:28.260
(SIGHS RESIGNEDLY)

34:28.360 --> 34:30.499
I never thought
I'd have to use these again.

34:32.360 --> 34:34.339
Cost always
seemed tOO high.

34:35.680 --> 34:38.137
B_ut circumstances
beIng what they are,

34:40.280 --> 34:41.861
I can't afford not to.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.139
See, ifI don't
make you talk,

34:46.000 --> 34:47.945
I lose everyone

34:48.040 --> 34:50.144
and everything
I've ever cared about.

34:50.600 --> 34:52.500
Then you understand
why I won't.

34:55.520 --> 34:57.101
This only ends one way.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.017
I know.

35:03.760 --> 35:05.625
SO let's get tO it,
shall we?

35:08.200 --> 35:09.542
What are you doing here?

35:09.640 --> 35:11.505
Looking for you.

35:13.400 --> 35:14.788
What's going on?

35:20.080 --> 35:21.468
Come here.

35:22.800 --> 35:23.869
Come here.

35:26.640 --> 35:28.141
The Lady is coming,

35:29.520 --> 35:31.499
and the only thing that's
standing between her and us

35:31.600 --> 35:33.420
is the information
this man has.

35:33.680 --> 35:35.068
We must do
whatever it takes.

35:35.720 --> 35:37.267
But what's that for?

35:38.560 --> 35:40.187
Moving past your fear.

35:44.920 --> 35:47.024
I think I Should gO.
NO, no, no, you stay.

35:47.120 --> 35:48.189
This is part
Of your training tOO.

35:48.280 --> 35:49.747
Whatever the hells
is going on here,

35:49.840 --> 35:51.580
it stops right
gods damn now.

35:55.080 --> 35:57.503
You don't invite a two-day
Old to a torture party,

35:57.600 --> 35:59.625
something which, by the
way, Should be very clear.

35:59.760 --> 36:01.022
I didn't.
He walked in on me.

36:01.120 --> 36:02.667
And you just decided
it was a gOOd Opportunity

36:02.760 --> 36:04.307
to teach him about
eyeball gouging?

36:04.400 --> 36:05.389
You're overreacting.

36:05.480 --> 36:07.345
And I wasn't gonna
teach him that.

36:07.440 --> 36:08.543
Yes, you were!

36:08.640 --> 36:10.107
There's a war
comIng, D'aVIn.

36:10.520 --> 36:11.782
We can't coddle him.

36:11.880 --> 36:13.268
This goes way
beyond coddling.

36:14.120 --> 36:16.065
Self-defense is one thing,
but that was something else.

36:16.160 --> 36:18.025
That is what
it takes to survive.

36:18.120 --> 36:20.429
And Khlyen made me do
a lot worse, a lot younger.

36:20.520 --> 36:21.839
You were abused, Dutch.

36:24.560 --> 36:25.697
(SCOFFS)

36:26.720 --> 36:28.460
How dare you
say that to me?

36:30.480 --> 36:31.868
He did what he had to.

36:32.840 --> 36:34.899
He made me
what I needed tO be,

36:35.000 --> 36:36.900
and he taught me
to protect myself.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.217
That was abuse.

36:38.840 --> 36:40.979
What Khlyen did was wrong.

36:42.080 --> 36:43.661
NO child Should
go through that.

36:46.840 --> 36:51.379
What happened to you was messed up, but
I W/l/ not let you repeat that cycle,

36:51.520 --> 36:52.623
not to my son

36:53.720 --> 36:55.221
and not to you.

36:55.320 --> 36:57.345
Who the hells are you to
tell me what I need to do,

36:57.440 --> 36:58.862
what we need to do?

36:59.160 --> 37:00.821
The Lady wants him,

37:01.000 --> 37:03.059
and he is the key
to stopping her.

37:03.160 --> 37:04.422
You don't know that.

37:04.520 --> 37:05.782
Yes, I dO.

37:07.680 --> 37:10.581
He is special, and I can
train him to be a weapon.

37:10.680 --> 37:13.137
NO.

37:13.840 --> 37:16.183
Find another way
to fight her.

37:17.800 --> 37:21.145
LUCY: Dutch, there is a problem with
the prisoner in the cargo hold.

37:24.880 --> 37:26.222
What did you do?

37:26.520 --> 37:28.420
I didn't do anything.
DUTCH: Oh, really?

37:28.520 --> 37:30.829
He just Spontaneously
suffered massive hemorrhaging?

37:30.920 --> 37:32.023
Dutch...

37:32.120 --> 37:34.259
LUCY: My scans indicate
an excessively high level

37:34.360 --> 37:36.146
of cyanide in his system.

37:37.200 --> 37:38.622
Are you Okay?

37:38.720 --> 37:40.620
DUTCH: Shit, he must've taken
a timed-release capsule

37:40.720 --> 37:42.620
in case things went south
at the White Blade.

37:43.200 --> 37:45.225
Whatever he knew,
he tOOk with him.

37:45.800 --> 37:49.304
I wanted to stop him,
but I was too late.

37:50.080 --> 37:51.217
It's Okay.

37:56.560 --> 37:57.549
Shit.

38:06.840 --> 38:08.660
I hope
you're getting this, Fancy,

38:09.120 --> 38:10.781
because I dO not know
where I am.

38:11.160 --> 38:13.742
L/ke, the air literal/y
tastes l/ke ewz

38:14.120 --> 38:15.508
and it's moist.

38:15.600 --> 38:17.101
TURN: You ’re coming in loud
and creepy, Pree.

38:17.200 --> 38:18.940
Look for any kind
Of distinct markings,

38:19.040 --> 38:20.940
anything that can tell us
where they’ve taken you.

38:21.120 --> 38:22.223
Oh, gods.

38:24.120 --> 38:25.508
We’re on the RAC.

38:32.920 --> 38:35.138
I do not like what they've
done with the place.

38:44.280 --> 38:45.747
Hey-

38:48.400 --> 38:51.619
Listen, I don't always
say the right thing,

38:52.280 --> 38:54.180
but I'm pretty great at
just shutting my big mouth

38:54.280 --> 38:56.020
and listening, if you wanna,

38:57.400 --> 38:58.719
you know...

38:59.960 --> 39:02.906
Hanging out with Dutch and
training was really fun at first.

39:04.240 --> 39:05.662
Then it wasn't.

39:08.320 --> 39:09.821
How disappointed is she?

39:10.840 --> 39:13.980
That is not something
that you need to worry about.

39:15.960 --> 39:18.019
What happened
wasn't your fault.

39:18.840 --> 39:21.217
You're still a kid,
and the adults in your life,

39:21.320 --> 39:23.902
they make choices, but you
don't have to carry them.

39:26.240 --> 39:28.060
I knew what that man
was gonna dO.

39:28.640 --> 39:29.777
I wanted to save him.

39:29.880 --> 39:31.507
How could you know
about the cyanide?

39:32.000 --> 39:33.581
Even Dutch
didn't catch that.

39:33.680 --> 39:34.669
I don't know.

39:35.440 --> 39:36.623
I just knew.

39:39.680 --> 39:41.068
Is there something wrong
with me?

39:41.440 --> 39:43.067
NO.
Then what am I?

39:45.680 --> 39:47.068
You're my son.

39:52.680 --> 39:54.420
I've been thinking
about names.

39:56.240 --> 39:57.662
There's something
I wanna be called.

39:57.760 --> 39:58.977
Oh, Yeah’?

40:00.040 --> 40:01.223
Jaqobis.

40:04.680 --> 40:06.659
But, like, Jaq, for short.

40:10.080 --> 40:11.627
Jag Km Rh.

40:13.160 --> 40:14.377
That's a gOOd name.

40:14.480 --> 40:16.107
That's a very good name.

40:18.880 --> 40:20.859
SO what are you
gonna tell Dutch?

40:23.360 --> 40:24.622
Nothing.

40:28.040 --> 40:29.257
Pack your bags.

40:29.840 --> 40:31.159
We're gonna hit the road.
