Better not argue with anything

Do you understand?
I don't take any shit from new trainers.

- Come on, man.

02:57.680 --> 02:59.600
Just relax, do it outside even, Modie.

03:00.280 --> 03:03.640
Ay, Sully. Bro, remember,
this isn't Summerhouse, please.

03:04.360 --> 03:06.000
My wing, my people.

03:06.080 --> 03:08.400
Geezer, show some respect, let me order.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.240
What, are you a bad boy now, Modie?

03:11.720 --> 03:13.880

Get your breakfast

03:26.200 --> 03:27.920
Fucking serious, Modie?

03:28.280 --> 03:29.280

03:43.360 --> 03:46.360
Keep it up, Sullivan. You might think
you're getting out on Friday,

03:46.440 --> 03:50.320
but I'm the man who makes that Friday
next year, or the year after.

03:50.640 --> 03:53.000
All I have to do is get you up on charges

03:53.080 --> 03:56.120
and have you down in the seg
before your feet touch the ground.

03:56.200 --> 03:58.320
And trust me, son, I'd love to do that.
In here.

Hey, yo, Stef, was you in my room?

06:03.640 --> 06:05.960
No, I don't go in your room.
Why, what's wrong?

06:06.360 --> 06:07.960
Nothing. You're good, don't worry.

06:09.120 --> 06:12.320
Don't forget,

06:18.640 --> 06:21.200
Well, I better hear good things

06:25.320 --> 06:27.440
You was in my room last night,
and you took some money.

06:27.520 --> 06:30.080
Don't even think about
lying to me right now, Aaron.

06:30.400 --> 06:33.120
- [tsks] All right man, I'm sorry.
- Why'd you take it?

06:33.200 --> 06:35.720
- Look, I said I'm sorry, man.
- Shut up. I said why?

06:36.600 --> 06:38.160
Some girl at uni, innit?

06:38.240 --> 06:40.760
Fam, just wanted to take her out,
show her a good time.

06:40.840 --> 06:43.320
Wait, let me get this straight.
So you took my money for a girl?

06:43.400 --> 06:45.440
- Bruv, I don't have any money on me.
- Where is it?

06:46.200 --> 06:47.960
- I just...
- Where the fuck's the money?

06:48.040 --> 06:49.240
All right.

06:52.240 --> 06:54.960
Listen, don't go in my room.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.120
- I won't.
- D'you understand?

06:56.200 --> 06:57.040
I won't!

06:57.120 --> 06:59.680
- Don't go through my things either!
- I won't, I swear.

07:04.200 --> 07:05.720
Hey, look, I said I'm sorry, man.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.720
- You know what day it is today, right?
- Yeah.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.240

07:41.640 --> 07:42.520
Ah...

07:42.800 --> 07:44.720
Who's knocking at the door this early?

07:50.600 --> 07:52.200
Hello, what's your name?

07:53.840 --> 07:54.800
Mum...

07:56.840 --> 07:59.040

Okay. Go and get your bag and your lunch.

08:06.400 --> 08:07.360
Just go.

08:09.920 --> 08:11.960
We're from the UK Immigration Service.

08:12.320 --> 08:13.360
[Amma] Yes?

08:13.440 --> 08:14.600

Come on, come on. Go.

08:21.640 --> 08:23.160
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

08:25.680 --> 08:28.120
What's this all about,
if you don't mind me asking?

08:28.200 --> 08:30.920
[female agent] It would be easier
if we could discuss it inside, madam.

08:32.039 --> 08:33.039
[Amma] Okay.

08:54.280 --> 08:57.400
We have reason to believe you do not have
the legal right to be in this country.

08:57.480 --> 08:58.440
[sighs]

08:58.520 --> 09:00.720

I've been to Immigration.

09:04.320 --> 09:05.600
They said I could stay.

09:06.720 --> 09:08.200
My papers are correct.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.440
Do you work, Amma? Do you have a job?

09:10.520 --> 09:12.960
Of course, I've always worked.

09:15.040 --> 09:17.760
- Where do you currently work, Amma?
- At the hospital.

09:17.840 --> 09:20.560

09:24.680 --> 09:26.000

09:26.720 --> 09:29.520

Okay.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.480
Is that even fucking clever, bruv?

10:33.560 --> 10:35.000
Where the fuck

10:35.080 --> 10:37.920
G, I already told you, I have someone.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.160
They have high-grade,
they have everything we need.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.960
And they're gonna sell it to us
for way lower

10:42.040 --> 10:43.800
than what the Turks were selling for
anyway.

10:45.840 --> 10:47.800
- I need to think about it still.
- Nah, you don't.

10:47.880 --> 10:48.840
I'm gonna chat to Modie.

10:48.920 --> 10:51.000

except making Ps,

10:51.080 --> 10:52.840
which we ain't done in a long time.

10:54.400 --> 10:55.880
Bruv, that's true, you know.

It'll do you good to grind up

13:16.360 --> 13:17.200
One night, babe.

13:17.280 --> 13:19.280

14:32.920 --> 14:35.080
It's a blend from Mexico, Brazil

There you go.

15:20.960 --> 15:22.160
Thank you very much.

15:23.440 --> 15:24.480
Sorry.

15:42.120 --> 15:43.160
[scoffs]

16:24.560 --> 16:26.680
[distant police siren wailing]

16:34.800 --> 16:36.760
[Dushane] Out of the way, man.
Move out of the way.

17:08.960 --> 17:10.280
[knocking]

17:16.520 --> 17:18.760
- Is Pat there?
- [woman] Shelley, who's that?

17:18.839 --> 17:19.960
Shh.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.240
- [door shuts]
- What d'you mean, 'who's that'?

17:24.599 --> 17:26.640
You need me to tell you who it is, yeah?

17:26.720 --> 17:28.800
I don't believe my eyes.

17:31.320 --> 17:33.160
[Dushane chuckles]
Let me take off my jacket.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.240
[Dushane sighs]

17:39.680 --> 17:41.960
Look at you, you're looking good, Mum.

17:42.040 --> 17:45.160
I don't look good at all.
I'm a sick old woman.

17:46.400 --> 17:47.920
You put on weight.

17:48.160 --> 17:49.600
[laughs] Yeah?

17:50.000 --> 17:51.080
So have you.

17:51.520 --> 17:53.640
Don't talk like that to your mother.

17:53.880 --> 17:57.360
I have diabetes type two,
what's your excuse?

17:57.440 --> 17:58.280
Rum.

17:58.760 --> 18:00.280
- [Pat tsks]
- [Dushane chuckles]

18:01.280 --> 18:03.040
Oh, did you meet Shelley?

18:03.120 --> 18:03.960
Yeah.

18:04.680 --> 18:06.840
- Hi.
- [Pat] She comes every day.

18:07.400 --> 18:09.200
She even does my nails.

18:09.560 --> 18:10.640
Okay.

18:11.200 --> 18:13.120
Wow, nice.

18:15.680 --> 18:17.520
Is it safe, you being home?

18:19.360 --> 18:20.680
Yeah, don't worry.

18:21.360 --> 18:23.600
I need to give you your shot now,
Mrs Hill.

18:24.400 --> 18:26.240
No, no, no, it's cool. I can do that.

18:29.040 --> 18:30.400
[Dushane] I still remember how.

18:31.920 --> 18:32.840
[sighs]

18:34.480 --> 18:35.400
Come on, let me see.

18:36.800 --> 18:37.800
[exhales sharply]

18:37.880 --> 18:38.760
Mum.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.200
You know you're meant to rotate
where you inject it.

18:41.280 --> 18:43.200
I know, I know, but I forget,

18:43.280 --> 18:45.880
and it hurts more doing it that way.

18:45.960 --> 18:47.160
All right, just hold on.

18:51.360 --> 18:52.520
You got ice?

18:54.640 --> 18:55.560
[chuckles]

18:57.400 --> 18:58.320
Thank you.

18:58.400 --> 18:59.240
Mm-hmm.

19:04.920 --> 19:07.640
- There you go.
- Thank you, son. Thank you.

19:08.120 --> 19:10.720
You've always been very good
at doing this.

19:11.080 --> 19:12.240
Okay, listen.

19:12.840 --> 19:14.000
I have to go now, okay?

19:14.680 --> 19:17.000
- But you've only just got here.
- I know.

19:17.120 --> 19:18.880
Don't worry, I'll be back tomorrow.
[chuckles]

19:19.440 --> 19:20.400
All right?

19:21.440 --> 19:22.400
Love you.

19:24.440 --> 19:26.520
- I'll see you later.
- Mind how you go now.

19:26.600 --> 19:27.720
All right, Mum.

19:29.360 --> 19:33.080
So, how long you been taking care of her?

19:34.240 --> 19:35.440
About a year now.

19:35.600 --> 19:36.440
Ah.

19:37.360 --> 19:38.600
You're doing a good job.

19:39.080 --> 19:41.040
Well, she's a very special lady.

19:42.240 --> 19:43.240
Cool.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.520
- I'll see you later, yeah?
- Take care.

19:53.760 --> 19:54.680
[sighs]

19:54.760 --> 19:56.040
This is dank.

19:57.720 --> 19:59.520
- Oh, my God.
- [door opens]

20:00.360 --> 20:01.320
[sighs]

20:10.360 --> 20:11.800
How do you like the shower?

20:12.360 --> 20:13.600
It looks good still.

20:14.280 --> 20:15.520
Smells good too.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.640
I like my things nice and clean.

20:19.040 --> 20:20.160
[Lizzie chuckles]

20:41.400 --> 20:42.520
[door opens]

20:42.600 --> 20:44.920
[Jeffrey] Sorry I'm late.
My meeting went long.

20:45.400 --> 20:48.680
Putting together a consortium of investors
to redevelop one of the local estates,

20:48.760 --> 20:50.760
like a total regeneration.

20:51.520 --> 20:52.520
Where did we get to?

20:53.080 --> 20:55.960
So basically, we're gonna need a supply,
and it's gonna have to be regular.

20:56.040 --> 20:58.280
If I don't deliver to my people,
they'll go somewhere else.

20:58.360 --> 21:00.200
Totally understood.
Basic business principles.

21:00.280 --> 21:02.920
Does 15 kilos a month
sound like a regular supply to you?

21:03.000 --> 21:04.560
[Kit] Fifteen kilos?

21:04.640 --> 21:05.640
Phew.

21:05.720 --> 21:06.920
That's a lot of blow.

21:07.280 --> 21:09.480
Gonna put a big smile on a lot of faces.

21:10.040 --> 21:11.920
Well, I'm assuming you can handle it.

21:12.600 --> 21:14.600
Jeffrey and me
were thinking that if this works out,

21:14.680 --> 21:15.840
we can bring you a lot more.

21:17.480 --> 21:18.520
[chuckles]

21:18.840 --> 21:19.920
We can handle it.

21:20.400 --> 21:22.800
- [hip hop plays on stereo]
- But, fam, 15 kilos?

21:23.760 --> 21:25.120
[Kit] How we gonna move that?

21:25.360 --> 21:27.680
Set up a meeting with Cam, innit.
Somewhere neutral.

21:28.320 --> 21:30.520
A-Road? Are you insane, cuz?

21:31.360 --> 21:33.400
G, Cam got his food off the Turks, nah?

21:33.480 --> 21:35.640
So he's gonna be like everyone else,
gonna be dry.

21:36.040 --> 21:37.840
- Bro, man. Use your head, man!
- Gonna be dry!

21:37.920 --> 21:39.560
If you go to Cam
saying we have a supplier,

21:39.640 --> 21:41.600
you know what's gonna happen, right?

21:41.960 --> 21:44.080
He'll do to us what we done to the Turks.

21:45.680 --> 21:46.800
[Jamie sighs]

21:46.880 --> 21:49.280
And it'll be him and Lizzie
squeezin' into that bathroom.

21:51.160 --> 21:54.160
I saw that. You know I got eyes
on the back of my head.

21:54.240 --> 21:56.320
G, you know you're sounding
like your mum right now.

21:56.840 --> 21:57.920
It's Cam, man.

21:59.240 --> 22:01.560
Bruv, I told you already
about this yout, fam.

22:01.640 --> 22:03.960
He's unstable, fam.
He's unstable, anyting...

22:04.040 --> 22:07.680
Bro, opportunities like this
come once in a fucking lifetime.

22:07.760 --> 22:10.840
It's either we take it now, or we spend
the rest of our life living in regret.

22:10.920 --> 22:12.600
[tsks] Come on, bro, man.

22:13.640 --> 22:15.040
Money season, B.

22:15.840 --> 22:17.160
[inmate] Yo, square it, square it!

22:20.120 --> 22:21.680
[onlookers cheering]

22:22.480 --> 22:23.720
[inmate 2] Here, baby.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.600
[indistinct chatter]

22:28.280 --> 22:29.280
Can you open that for me?

22:36.040 --> 22:37.520
[chatter continues in background]

22:37.600 --> 22:38.600
[gate clangs shut]

23:09.160 --> 23:11.720
[man 1] Trust me, you're gonna
love this ting. Fiver.

23:12.280 --> 23:14.360
- What?
- Oh, my G... What are you doin'...

23:14.920 --> 23:17.200
Crackhead. What you man doing?

23:17.280 --> 23:19.280

- Nah, nah, nah.

23:19.360 --> 23:21.920
You man are fucking violating.
Take your shit out of my cell, man.

23:22.000 --> 23:22.880
[snickers]

23:23.320 --> 23:26.200
- Get the fuck out of my cell, man.
- Do you know who you're fucking with, G?

23:26.720 --> 23:27.800
[man 1 groans]

23:28.320 --> 23:30.160
Yo, wah gwaan, G.

23:30.240 --> 23:32.080

23:32.680 --> 23:34.080

23:34.160 --> 23:36.400
- You know what it is, G.

23:36.480 --> 23:37.440
Step.

23:37.880 --> 23:38.960
You good, fam?

23:39.040 --> 23:40.440

23:40.720 --> 23:42.600
Chill, fam. Why do you even wanna...

23:43.040 --> 23:44.920
- Are you fucking...

23:45.840 --> 23:47.760
Sully, how can I help you, fam?

23:47.840 --> 23:49.880
You're looking mad stressed,

23:49.960 --> 23:52.240
veins all bursting out
the side of your head and that.

23:52.320 --> 23:55.880
I've got a warm bag of spice.
A gift from me to you.

23:55.960 --> 23:58.440
Hey, big man. Chill, man, you're good.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.960
- Nah, you let him go. What, you scared?
- Nah.

24:01.040 --> 24:01.880
You scared, Modie?

24:01.960 --> 24:03.960
I just want him to see
what you're about to do.

24:04.040 --> 24:06.000
- You stand up. Stand up.
- What are you going to do?

24:06.080 --> 24:07.280
What are you going to do?

24:07.800 --> 24:08.640
Huh?

24:08.720 --> 24:12.880
Sully, don't tell me
because you're getting out on Friday,

24:12.960 --> 24:15.320
- big, bad Sully now, don't tell me...
- Don't fuckin' touch me.

24:15.400 --> 24:17.360
...'Cause you're getting out on Friday,

24:17.640 --> 24:19.640
you're gonna come here
and just have a conversation?

24:19.720 --> 24:20.600
I'm disappointed.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.960
Get your fucking guys
out of my cell, blud.

24:23.480 --> 24:24.920
Ooh! [giggles]

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Sully!

24:26.080 --> 24:27.600
Summerhouse Sully!

24:28.360 --> 24:30.200
You ain't going nowhere on Friday!

24:31.040 --> 24:32.440
Fuckin' pussy.

24:45.480 --> 24:46.640
[Dushane] Yo, fam.

24:48.920 --> 24:50.240
- You good?
- Mm-hmm.

24:51.240 --> 24:52.520
[hip hop playing in background]

25:05.320 --> 25:06.520
[kettle clattering]

25:11.520 --> 25:13.080
What happened to your arm, cuz?

25:13.680 --> 25:15.040
[Dris] I had a stroke, fam.

25:16.680 --> 25:17.800
A stroke?

25:18.920 --> 25:20.400
That's an old man thing, no, innit?

25:20.720 --> 25:22.480
Too many balloons, bro.

25:22.560 --> 25:23.920
You were doing NOS, yeah?

25:24.640 --> 25:26.000
What, you think that's bad?

25:26.080 --> 25:27.680
Been lower than that, bruv.

25:27.760 --> 25:30.720
These days, it's dead, it's hard.

25:30.800 --> 25:32.480
Hard to make Ps out here.

25:32.640 --> 25:33.480
[Dushane] Safe.

25:34.200 --> 25:37.400
Anyway, that there's a old man ting.

25:37.480 --> 25:39.400
- Getting your dad's body now, yeah?
- [chuckles]

25:40.240 --> 25:42.240
It's what Jamaica does to you, fam.

25:43.040 --> 25:44.840
And furthermore, you can't really talk.

25:45.080 --> 25:47.800
Your stomach is, like,
two times the size of mine, bro.

25:48.160 --> 25:49.520
- Fam... [tsks]
- [chuckles]

25:49.600 --> 25:51.880
Put on a bit of weight, hair's goin'.

25:51.960 --> 25:54.120
- Fuckin' hell.
- Stress, fam.

25:55.440 --> 25:57.960
Anyway, forget that.
How was Jamaica anyway?

25:59.760 --> 26:01.200
It's hard out there, bro.

26:03.920 --> 26:06.800
[Dris] Supply's been dead
since the Turks got wiped out.

26:06.880 --> 26:08.120
It's mayhem, innit?

26:08.440 --> 26:11.480
Every few months,
you never know who you're dealing with.

26:11.560 --> 26:14.400
And when someone new comes along,
they up the price.

26:14.480 --> 26:16.640
It's getting hard
to make a living out here.

26:16.960 --> 26:18.800
Who do you reckon duppied the Turks?

26:19.120 --> 26:20.680
Everyone's got their own ideas.

26:20.760 --> 26:23.320
It might be Cam, them A-Road youts.

26:23.960 --> 26:25.080
What about Fields?

26:25.680 --> 26:28.440
Nah. Since Modie went in,
everyone's been quiet.

26:28.520 --> 26:29.880
Modie's inside, yeah?

26:29.960 --> 26:32.120
Yeah, best place for him, bruv.

26:32.200 --> 26:34.360
Nutter, got 18 years.

26:34.440 --> 26:37.000
Hold on, what about Hazards? The Shillins?

26:37.080 --> 26:39.960
Nah, you won't know them, fam.
They're all little kids.

26:40.040 --> 26:42.240
So hold on, bruv,
where you getting your food from then?

26:42.320 --> 26:44.240
From the Turks, like everyone else was.

26:44.320 --> 26:46.120
But now, the road's dry, fam.

26:47.040 --> 26:49.920
You know what? That's a good ting.
No competition, innit?

26:50.360 --> 26:51.360
Yeah, true.

26:51.440 --> 26:54.440
Soon as man link this ting,
money's gonna come in, fam.

26:57.160 --> 26:58.400
[Dushane] Where is man's stall?

26:59.040 --> 27:00.880
The yard-food shop ting
that was there before.

27:00.960 --> 27:02.320
- Right there.
- Yeah, there, innit?

27:02.400 --> 27:03.240
Yeah.

27:07.080 --> 27:08.160
What's goin' on?

27:08.240 --> 27:09.320
[Jaq] Wah gwaan.

27:09.760 --> 27:10.680
What you saying?

27:10.760 --> 27:12.520
- [Romy] Wah gwaan.
- You know who this is?

27:12.600 --> 27:14.760
- What you saying, fam?
- [Dris] This is Dushane.

27:14.840 --> 27:16.800
Dushane was top G in Summerhouse.

27:16.880 --> 27:18.240
Stand up, man.

27:19.080 --> 27:20.120
[tsks]

27:22.320 --> 27:24.720
So what, did you bring
any food for us then, top G?

27:25.240 --> 27:26.120
[Dushane scoffs]

27:26.960 --> 27:29.760
Bruv, you ain't got no one
other than these fucking kids?

27:29.840 --> 27:30.880
That's it, bruv.

27:32.120 --> 27:33.600
We need more army, man.

27:35.080 --> 27:38.600
Man, listen, someone's gonna
come and try sell you food,

27:39.200 --> 27:40.760
take a good look at that person.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.040
He's the one that duppied the Turks.

27:43.280 --> 27:44.200
[Dris] Mm.

27:44.280 --> 27:45.200
[Dushane murmurs]

27:45.640 --> 27:46.520
Bless.

27:48.520 --> 27:51.400
- The fuck's wrong with you, man?
- D'you know what the fuck's wrong with me?

27:51.480 --> 27:53.480
How the fuck am I supposed to know

27:53.560 --> 27:55.320
If he's such a bad man, where's he been?

27:57.720 --> 27:59.960
Goes for a minute, try look pon me so.

28:02.640 --> 28:03.520

28:10.160 --> 28:13.120
Excuse me, can I have
a look at these watches, please?

28:18.880 --> 28:20.720
Yeah, what kind of look are you after?

28:20.800 --> 28:23.400
Uh, kind of look that would
make me look good.

28:23.480 --> 28:24.440
[chuckles]

28:25.160 --> 28:26.640
Um, what about this one?

28:30.040 --> 28:31.040
[Jamie] Thanks.

28:32.480 --> 28:33.400
What do you think?

28:36.520 --> 28:39.520
- I think it suits you.
- Yeah? Does it make me look good though?

28:40.560 --> 28:41.400
Yeah.

28:41.920 --> 28:43.160
Let me try that one.

28:49.400 --> 28:50.400
What's your name?

28:51.200 --> 28:52.240
My name?

28:52.600 --> 28:55.080
Yeah, we're the only two here,
and I know my name.

28:55.440 --> 28:56.880
It's Jamie.

28:58.680 --> 28:59.600
Tilly.

29:00.720 --> 29:03.560
So what do you think?
Look good? Be honest.

29:04.680 --> 29:07.120
I think they both suit you,
but this one more.

29:07.200 --> 29:08.920
That's not what I asked you, yeah?

29:10.320 --> 29:11.240
I think you look good.

29:12.240 --> 29:13.280
[chuckles softly]

29:18.960 --> 29:20.040
[sighs]

29:27.800 --> 29:29.600
- What you saying?
- My man's there, you know.

29:29.680 --> 29:30.720
- What?
- My man's there.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.920
Yeah, I seen him still,
that's why I jumped out.

29:33.320 --> 29:35.640
I'm gonna chat to him. Don't worry, yeah?
Love.

29:41.320 --> 29:42.320
Who are you?

29:43.120 --> 29:44.240
Jamie, innit?

29:44.320 --> 29:45.920
Jamie. Jamie. Man not know no Jamie.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.680
Where's Jamie from? Man don't know Jamie.

29:47.760 --> 29:51.120
What? Fam, you think I won't violate you
'cause of the cameras, rude boy? [tsks]

29:51.920 --> 29:52.880
[Cam chuckles]

29:54.080 --> 29:55.240
I'm running the Fields now.

29:55.320 --> 29:57.520
What, the mandem letting youse
run tings now, yeah?

29:57.880 --> 29:59.320
[chuckles] That what's happening?

30:00.040 --> 30:01.160
That what's happening?

30:02.040 --> 30:02.920
Hmm?

30:03.480 --> 30:05.560
- So what happened to Leyton?
- Leyton's cool, man.

30:05.840 --> 30:08.080
He's just gone to see some family
or somethin' like that.

30:08.160 --> 30:10.160
Yeah. So w-what do you want?

30:10.840 --> 30:13.000
Man's got high grade for sale.
I've got white and B-dose.

30:13.080 --> 30:15.440
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying where you getting this from?

30:15.520 --> 30:16.640
That's my business.

30:16.720 --> 30:18.400
Yeah? Well, how much?

30:18.680 --> 30:20.360
- The white is 40 grand a kilo.
- Forty?

30:20.640 --> 30:22.080
Allow them prices there, fam.

30:22.160 --> 30:24.000
Think you're tough
and them tings, brother?

30:24.080 --> 30:25.720
Can't come to them prices
with blood money.

30:25.800 --> 30:28.800
Listen, cut that up. You know you're
making five times that much, brother.

30:29.080 --> 30:29.960
[Cam] Hear me, brother?

30:30.040 --> 30:31.680
Source better have
bloodclaat good protection.

30:31.760 --> 30:33.560
Anything happens to the source
that can happen to the Turks,

30:33.640 --> 30:35.640
then mine's high and dry, rude boy,
you hear?

30:35.720 --> 30:38.040
Brother, do you want the food or not?

30:40.240 --> 30:41.080
[grumbles]

30:41.680 --> 30:43.920
Fam, hear what? Hear what?
Me and you should share this.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.520
We'll start with you
having better protection.

30:45.600 --> 30:48.240
Brother, this ain't about
no sharing, like.

30:49.600 --> 30:52.960
[scoffs] Man's gonna chat to my dogs
and come chat back to yours, innit?

30:53.240 --> 30:54.120
Yeah?

30:54.800 --> 30:55.880
Yeah?

30:55.960 --> 30:57.160
- Say nothin'.
- All right.

31:05.080 --> 31:06.960
Bruv, what's he saying?
Is everything good?

31:07.680 --> 31:08.680
Everything's cool, man.

31:08.760 --> 31:11.480
Listen, I'm gonna go back
to that shop, innit?

31:11.560 --> 31:13.920
- Shout when you get to yard, yeah?
- Blud, you sure?

31:14.000 --> 31:17.240
Bro, man is good, you get it? Love, man.

31:17.600 --> 31:19.160
- Aight, shout me.
- Wah gwaan.

31:22.040 --> 31:23.520
What you saying, you miss me?

31:24.120 --> 31:25.520
Let me have that one though.

31:26.040 --> 31:27.040
It's all right.

31:28.280 --> 31:30.520
You don't think so? Like, it's not good?

31:30.600 --> 31:31.760
I mean, it's whatever.

31:31.840 --> 31:35.200
It's what our management tells us to say,
you know, keep the customer happy.

31:35.280 --> 31:37.120
[tsks] You're an honest girl, Tilly.

31:37.880 --> 31:39.400
So, are you gonna buy it?

31:39.480 --> 31:42.000
I'll buy it... if I can get your number.

31:43.240 --> 31:44.560
You're not getting my number.

31:44.640 --> 31:46.160
Are you forgetting
what your management says?

31:46.240 --> 31:47.560
It'll make me feel good.

31:47.840 --> 31:49.480
I'm not giving you my number.

31:51.280 --> 31:52.120
All right.

31:52.880 --> 31:54.400
I'll give you my number.

31:54.480 --> 31:55.840
I don't want your number.

32:03.120 --> 32:04.640
Look, that's my number, innit?

32:05.040 --> 32:07.080
Call me, text me, whatever.

32:07.680 --> 32:09.880
- And I'll take this one.
- Cool.

32:10.360 --> 32:12.800
[female teacher] I just want to see
a bit of improvement, maybe,

32:12.880 --> 32:14.680
in concentration in class next term.

32:14.760 --> 32:18.720
But apart from that, I think that
you're progressing rather well, actually.

32:18.800 --> 32:20.080
Just like his dad.

32:20.160 --> 32:22.080
[laughter]

32:24.080 --> 32:27.040
[female teacher] Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too, take care.

32:27.360 --> 32:30.160
- [Stefan] Put your phone away, man.
- I'm just texting Aaron, bruv.

32:30.240 --> 32:31.760
Forget him, it's our turn.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.040
[Jamie tsks]

32:38.680 --> 32:39.800
[female teacher] Take a seat.

32:39.880 --> 32:44.760
Hi, I'm Ms Griffiths. I'm Stefan's
head of year and he's in my history class.

32:44.840 --> 32:47.400
So, Stefan, how do you think you're doing?

32:47.480 --> 32:48.400
I don't know.

32:48.840 --> 32:50.480
- [Ms Griffiths] Do you enjoy history?
- No.

32:50.960 --> 32:52.840
Hey, don't be rude, little man.

32:53.240 --> 32:54.560
Okay, let's have a look.

32:56.520 --> 32:59.480
- Attendance...
- I make sure he doesn't miss school.

32:59.560 --> 33:01.240
And attendance is 100%.

33:01.720 --> 33:04.240
- Homework is a two.
- One's the best.

33:04.320 --> 33:05.600
[laughs]

33:05.680 --> 33:07.360
Organisation is two.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.760
Concentration is three, behaviour three.

33:12.880 --> 33:14.480
So he's doing good? [chuckles]

33:15.320 --> 33:18.080
- There's room for improvement.
- All right.

33:18.160 --> 33:21.520
Well, he's gonna improve, trust me.
Ain't that right, little man?

33:23.120 --> 33:25.400
So he's in a nice friendship group too.

33:25.480 --> 33:27.440
I mean,
you're friends with Ats, aren't you?

33:27.520 --> 33:30.200
- Yeah, he's my bro.
- Yeah, Ats sets a very good example.

33:30.280 --> 33:33.000
Next time I'm here, I wanna hear
you're doing as well as Ats, yeah?

33:33.800 --> 33:36.920
So next term, each student
is gonna be doing a family tree.

33:37.600 --> 33:40.400
It's just a way of
personalising history for them.

33:42.240 --> 33:43.320
Is that okay?

33:45.320 --> 33:46.320
Can I not do it?

33:47.280 --> 33:49.120
Nah, bruv. You can do it. [chuckles]

33:49.960 --> 33:51.560
- Excellent.
- Yeah?

33:51.640 --> 33:54.560
- Well, nice to meet you. Take care.
- Thank you very much. Nice to meet you.

33:54.640 --> 33:56.880
- See you tomorrow, Stefan.
- [Jamie] All right, who's next?

33:56.960 --> 33:58.600
[Stefan] Mr Evans. He don't like me.

33:59.200 --> 34:00.480
Thank you. Thank you.

34:01.440 --> 34:02.320
Thank you.

34:02.400 --> 34:04.240
- [male teacher] Okay, see you tomorrow.
- Bye.

34:06.600 --> 34:08.560
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

34:09.560 --> 34:10.800
- Hey.
- Hello.

34:10.880 --> 34:12.040
Are teachers calm?

34:12.120 --> 34:14.280
Yeah, I got all ones in history still.

34:14.360 --> 34:16.400
No, you got one one in history.
The rest were threes.

34:16.480 --> 34:18.159
Nah, he's lying, I got a two as well.

34:18.239 --> 34:20.440
The teachers were saying
how smart Ats is though.

34:21.520 --> 34:23.360
You all right though, Amma?
Is everything okay?

34:23.440 --> 34:24.840
I pray it will be okay.

34:25.719 --> 34:26.639
What's up?

34:27.080 --> 34:29.000
You have enough to worry about, Jamie.

34:30.080 --> 34:31.400
Stefan's a good boy.

34:32.639 --> 34:34.480
I have to get to work now, yeah?

34:35.040 --> 34:37.040
- Please be safe, yeah? See you later.
- Thank you.

34:37.120 --> 34:38.120
Hold it there.

34:41.960 --> 34:42.840
[sighs]

34:43.360 --> 34:45.159
Hi, are you a relative?

34:45.719 --> 34:47.840
- Brother.
- Ah, okay. [clears throat]

34:47.920 --> 34:48.760
So...

34:49.679 --> 34:50.679
Stefan.

34:51.199 --> 34:53.400
Why don't you tell me
how you think you're getting on?

34:56.639 --> 34:58.480
Well, it's not going very well, is it?

34:58.720 --> 35:01.360
I'm looking at the scores here
you've given, they ain't very good.

35:01.440 --> 35:03.440
Well, I'm afraid Stefan
isn't putting in the effort.

35:03.520 --> 35:06.440
How come? 'Cause all the other teachers
are giving him higher marks.

35:06.520 --> 35:09.360
What that says to me
is you're the odd one out, do you get it?

35:09.440 --> 35:12.240
Which means it ain't about him,
it's about you.

35:13.480 --> 35:15.520
Stefan also says you're very sarcastic.

35:15.600 --> 35:18.720
Nobody likes sarcasm, do you understand?

35:22.200 --> 35:23.280
Erm... [clears throat]

35:25.400 --> 35:29.160
Well, maybe we could look at
some of Stefan's marks again.

35:33.560 --> 35:34.760
[Jamie sighs]

35:51.840 --> 35:54.480
I got all ones in parents' evening,
except geography.

35:55.200 --> 35:56.480
Well, that's cool, man.

36:00.440 --> 36:03.600
Yo, Stefan was born at
one o'clock in the morning, you know.

36:04.160 --> 36:07.840
Ten o'clock, Mum rang Dad,
told him to come pick her up.

36:07.920 --> 36:09.480
So we all went down to the hospital.

36:09.720 --> 36:11.440
Mum couldn't wait to get out of there.

36:12.520 --> 36:15.280
August 26th, my birthday.

36:17.240 --> 36:18.120
Yeah.

36:18.360 --> 36:21.840
So we come here to this garden,
sat on this bench.

36:22.240 --> 36:23.800
Was looking at the new baby.

36:24.800 --> 36:25.720
Me?

36:28.680 --> 36:31.680
And this lady, like an older lady,
walks past.

36:31.760 --> 36:35.880
But then she came over.
She's like to Mum, 'How old's that baby?'

36:37.280 --> 36:39.840
[Jamie chuckles]
Mum said, 'He was born this morning.'

36:41.040 --> 36:43.400
The lady started busting at us,
she couldn't believe it.

36:43.480 --> 36:46.080
She said back in her day,
you'd have to spend, what,

36:46.160 --> 36:48.160
two weeks in hospital
before you could come out?

36:49.560 --> 36:51.000
Mum was so strong, man.

36:53.800 --> 36:55.480
Yeah, now I'm deep in it,

36:55.560 --> 36:56.760
she weren't ever ill.

36:57.600 --> 36:58.840
Never even had a cold.

37:00.680 --> 37:03.280
Dad too. He was strong.

37:04.360 --> 37:07.160
He was a real man.
When he spoke, everyone listened.

37:11.400 --> 37:12.440
Yeah, man.

37:12.520 --> 37:15.280
That's why we come here, innit,
on their birthdays.

37:17.480 --> 37:18.800
Happy birthday, Mum.

37:21.640 --> 37:22.920
Happy birthday, Mum.

37:33.320 --> 37:35.760
Don't worry, man, you're good.
You're a good boy.

37:36.680 --> 37:38.680
Yo, you're too big for all of that, man.

37:41.120 --> 37:43.200
- We're brothers though, right?
- Yeah, man.

37:46.760 --> 37:48.160
Tell me about this girl.

37:48.240 --> 37:50.960
What's her name?
The one that you wanted to take on a date.

37:51.040 --> 37:52.920
- Her name's Abby.
- Yeah.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
Abby, yeah?

37:55.440 --> 37:59.280
Well, you take Abby someplace nice,
show her a good time, yeah?

37:59.520 --> 38:00.920
- [Stefan clears throat]
- Thanks, man.

38:01.800 --> 38:06.240
This is for you, little man, for making me
proud of you today at school.

38:07.000 --> 38:07.880
You done well.

38:10.520 --> 38:13.360
Now, go home.
I gotta make a couple phone calls, innit?

38:15.280 --> 38:17.320
- All right, laters, yeah?
- Love.

38:17.400 --> 38:18.400
[Stefan sighs]

38:20.440 --> 38:21.400
Hold it.

38:37.600 --> 38:39.080
Everything cool though, yeah?

38:39.880 --> 38:40.720
[Jamie] Yeah, man.

38:41.800 --> 38:43.120
Everything's crystal.

38:44.560 --> 38:45.560
Love, yeah?

38:45.760 --> 38:46.760
[Aaron] Mm.

38:47.520 --> 38:50.440
- Safe, yeah?
- Love. Get home safe.

38:51.880 --> 38:53.000
[Jamie sighs]

39:24.680 --> 39:25.560
Amma.

39:26.920 --> 39:27.880
Hello.

39:32.720 --> 39:35.080
Have you had contact
with Immigration Service recently?

39:35.320 --> 39:36.240
I...

39:37.080 --> 39:37.960
Yes.

39:39.160 --> 39:40.760
Maybe we should sit down.

39:44.360 --> 39:45.400
I'm afraid that...

39:47.760 --> 39:49.720
I don't know how to say this to you, Amma,

39:49.800 --> 39:53.000
but we're gonna have to terminate
your employment.

39:54.080 --> 39:55.480
I am really sorry.

39:57.200 --> 39:59.000
I don't think I understand
what you're saying.

39:59.080 --> 40:01.720
We've had official notification
from the Home Office.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.960
The Trust would be in breach of the law
if you continue to work here.

40:05.160 --> 40:06.600
- How could this happen?
- I'm so sorry.

40:06.840 --> 40:08.440
Don't say this, please.

40:09.200 --> 40:10.360
[sighs]

40:11.080 --> 40:12.200
I am so sorry.

40:20.640 --> 40:21.520
[door opens]

40:26.760 --> 40:27.600
[door shuts]

40:28.520 --> 40:30.520
[inmates chattering]

40:53.800 --> 40:55.520
- Relax.
- [man] Is that it?

40:55.600 --> 40:57.160
Chill, play the game.

40:57.240 --> 40:58.400
Piss me off, swear to God.

40:58.480 --> 40:59.720
Bow, miss a goal.

41:00.800 --> 41:02.000
Bow, you're dead.

41:02.080 --> 41:03.680
Bro, hurry up,
I can see the card already.

41:03.760 --> 41:05.480
Yo, stop watching my cards, fam.

41:06.320 --> 41:07.960
- What you chatting about?
- Hurry up, bro.

41:10.160 --> 41:11.120
Yes.

41:11.440 --> 41:14.440
- Here we go, bruv. Here we go, bruv.
- Come on, blud. Why're you so quiet?

41:14.520 --> 41:15.480
[laughs]

41:35.920 --> 41:37.440
[male guard] Lock up! Lock up!

41:40.280 --> 41:43.160
Bro, I don't bang judge, judge bangs me.

41:43.240 --> 41:44.960
I'm gonna use these cigs.

41:45.040 --> 41:47.360
Next time you speak to your baby mum,
tell her.

41:47.440 --> 41:51.080
Tell her. I'm gonna be way calmer
on the phone, way calmer.

41:51.160 --> 41:54.320
Composure, lads. Composure!

41:54.720 --> 41:56.040
Respect me!

41:58.040 --> 42:00.200
[humming]

42:01.040 --> 42:01.880
Oi!

42:02.320 --> 42:04.640
- [screaming]
- Shh!

42:04.720 --> 42:05.800
Fucking pussy, now.

42:05.880 --> 42:09.400
[Modie screams in pain]

42:09.480 --> 42:10.920
- [whistle blowing]
- Fuck!

42:11.600 --> 42:15.080
[male guard] Everybody, in your cells.
Move! Move, move, move!

42:15.160 --> 42:17.080
Get in your cells now, gentlemen, come on!

42:17.720 --> 42:19.720
[whistle blowing]

42:37.920 --> 42:39.520
[Sully] Hey! What the fuck you doing?

42:40.440 --> 42:42.560
[male guard] Lock on! Lock on!

42:42.960 --> 42:44.000
I ain't done shit.

42:44.800 --> 42:46.880
[male medic] You're okay.
We'll get you sorted out.

42:51.200 --> 42:52.640
- Okay, you're okay.
- [groans]

43:05.400 --> 43:07.280
[distant police siren wailing]

43:15.360 --> 43:18.200
The first shipment
is five bags of white and five dark.

43:18.640 --> 43:20.040
Now, here's what's gonna happen.

43:20.640 --> 43:23.440
I'm gonna call you with the location
and the exact time.

43:23.520 --> 43:25.080
You're gonna come and pick it up.

43:25.440 --> 43:28.000
If you are one minute early,
you ain't getting your drugs.

43:28.080 --> 43:30.760
If you are one minute late,
you ain't getting your drugs.

43:30.840 --> 43:33.080
If you don't have the money,
you ain't getting your drugs.

43:34.360 --> 43:35.840
What money you talking about?

43:35.920 --> 43:37.280
The deposit, ten grand.

43:37.360 --> 43:39.600
If I don't see that deposit,
you ain't getting your drugs.

43:39.920 --> 43:40.920
You feel me?

43:45.720 --> 43:48.760
Once you've got the food,
it's your responsibility.

43:49.280 --> 43:50.800
You owe what you owe,

43:50.880 --> 43:52.560
and Sugar will collect what's his.

43:52.960 --> 43:55.400
And that includes
that boy back in Jamaica.

44:20.760 --> 44:23.800
You are charged
with assaulting a fellow prisoner.

44:23.880 --> 44:26.680
This adjudication will determine
the truth of the allegation.

44:26.760 --> 44:28.960
If you are found guilty,
you'll be awarded additional days

44:29.040 --> 44:31.920
to your sentence and/or time in isolation.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.120
- How do you plead?
- Not guilty.

44:35.680 --> 44:38.560
[Sully] Look, my release date's
tomorrow, as...

44:39.240 --> 44:40.080
as you know.

44:41.320 --> 44:44.320
Why would I do something so stupid
that's gonna stop me getting out? Hmm?

44:45.080 --> 44:46.560
Never make no sense.

44:46.640 --> 44:48.240
Plus, Modie, I know Modie.

44:48.800 --> 44:50.000
Basically a friend of mine.

44:50.800 --> 44:53.840
I respect him, so... he respects me.

44:53.920 --> 44:55.440
Where were you when the attack took place?

44:55.520 --> 44:58.400
I was reading a magazine, in my cell,

44:59.080 --> 45:02.800
where three screws dragged me
out of my bed and brought me down here.

45:04.520 --> 45:06.040
You ain't writing that down.

45:08.440 --> 45:09.680
So let me ask you this.

45:10.520 --> 45:11.960
Who does Modie say done it?

45:13.320 --> 45:14.520
Does he say it's me?

45:15.160 --> 45:16.280
I bet he don't.

45:17.120 --> 45:18.800
Does anyone else say it's me?

45:19.880 --> 45:24.160
'Cause if they do,
I got the right to hear them, down here,

45:24.240 --> 45:26.120
say it in front of me, to my face.

45:26.760 --> 45:28.920
And if you can't bring anyone down here,

45:29.560 --> 45:31.120
which I don't think you can,

45:31.640 --> 45:34.120
that tells me that you lot
ain't got no witnesses.

45:34.200 --> 45:37.320
The assailant used a plastic bowl
to scald the inmate.

45:37.400 --> 45:40.920
- Left his fingerprints on the bowl.
- Did you find my fingerprints on the bowl?

45:41.000 --> 45:45.120
- No. Is that because you used gloves?
- No, it's 'cause I didn't do it.

45:45.200 --> 45:46.600
So you ain't got my prints,

45:47.280 --> 45:48.320
no forensics,

45:49.000 --> 45:50.400
no CCTV,

45:51.640 --> 45:55.200
no witnesses,
the victim clearly ain't ID'd me...

45:57.720 --> 45:59.240
What the fuck am I doin' here?

46:00.960 --> 46:03.880
You'll be informed of
Adjudication's decision tomorrow morning.

46:07.920 --> 46:08.800
I can go?

46:16.360 --> 46:18.440
- [keys jangling]
- [lock clicks]

46:19.200 --> 46:21.200
[pulsing ambient music playing]

47:01.360 --> 47:03.400
Yo, what you saying?
Jump in, let's go, man.

47:03.880 --> 47:05.640
I'm not getting in that car.

47:05.720 --> 47:08.280
But these are my friends, they're cool.
Don't worry about nothin'.

47:08.360 --> 47:09.760
Jump in. We're gonna go
to a club or something.

47:09.840 --> 47:11.440
I'm not getting in that car
with your friends.

47:11.520 --> 47:14.880
- [Tyrone] She knows she cold outside.
- [Kit] She ain't getting in the car.

47:14.960 --> 47:17.440
Listen, you man, she wants you lot
to jump out the car.

47:17.520 --> 47:20.080
- I'm begging youse do that for me.
- Wait, what? [laughs]

47:20.160 --> 47:23.600
Brother, she don't want
your ugly face in the car, just jump out.

47:23.680 --> 47:25.880
You too, Si, man.
Just do that for me, please.

47:25.960 --> 47:27.160
- Is that cool?
- All right, bruv.

47:27.240 --> 47:29.520
- Say nothin', say nothin'.
- These two are jumping out.

47:30.840 --> 47:31.880
[Si groans]

47:34.480 --> 47:37.240
Listen, bro, she ain't
even trying to hear it, you know?

47:37.680 --> 47:38.760
You're joking, innit?

47:39.160 --> 47:40.920
Come on, man, yeah?

47:41.240 --> 47:42.480
Do that for me, bro.

47:42.560 --> 47:44.240
- [Tilly sighs]
- [Kit sighs]

47:44.320 --> 47:47.040
Listen, it's just me now.
What, you gonna jump in?

47:48.560 --> 47:51.360
You should get in the car, man.
He's a genuine guy, you know.

47:55.120 --> 47:56.080
Blud, you owe me one.

47:58.240 --> 47:59.920
[Tyrone] You best be doing something, man.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.480
[motorbike engine revving]

48:01.560 --> 48:03.200
[Kit] Aight, Jamie is sick.

48:03.840 --> 48:04.720
[Si] Who's that?

48:04.800 --> 48:06.120
- What? Oh, shit!
- [gunshots]

48:06.200 --> 48:07.160
[Tyrone] Fuckin'...

48:08.280 --> 48:10.040
[Jamie] Oh, shit!

48:10.120 --> 48:12.160
- [motorbike engine revving]
- [Kit] What the fuck?

48:12.720 --> 48:14.720
- [crowd screaming]
- [Kit] Who's that? Who's that?

48:15.480 --> 48:16.920
[Kit] Fuck! Who was that?

48:17.960 --> 48:19.240
Who the fuck was that though?

48:21.840 --> 48:22.800
[Kit] Fuck!

48:24.000 --> 48:25.040
Fuck them!

48:25.720 --> 48:26.960
[Jamie seethes]

48:36.040 --> 48:38.000
[keys jangling]

48:38.080 --> 48:40.040
[lock clicking]

48:48.800 --> 48:49.880
[man] Good morning.

48:50.600 --> 48:51.720
Good morning.

48:51.960 --> 48:54.440
Can I get your name,
date of birth and prison number, please?

48:54.680 --> 48:58.440
Gerard Sullivan, 13th of the second, 1984.

48:59.600 --> 49:02.000
81910593.

49:04.040 --> 49:05.120
Big day.

49:05.760 --> 49:07.600
I need you to sign
a couple of forms for me,

49:07.680 --> 49:09.520
give you your discharge grant.

49:09.600 --> 49:12.000
If you could sign there and there, please.

49:13.360 --> 49:16.160
Now, how are your relationships
with your friends and family?

49:18.920 --> 49:21.760
Have your relations suffered
while you've been in prison?

49:24.160 --> 49:26.520
Because if they have broken down, it's...

49:27.360 --> 49:29.120
it's not too late to build bridges.

49:29.200 --> 49:30.120
[chuckles softly]

49:30.720 --> 49:33.000
If your friends and family
know you've made progress in prison,

49:33.080 --> 49:35.440
- particularly in terms of addressing...
- Bro.

49:35.520 --> 49:37.440
What else have I got to sign, please?

49:37.520 --> 49:41.000
It's important that you don't dismiss
that as an option, Sullivan.

49:41.920 --> 49:43.280
Is there anything else?

49:43.600 --> 49:45.960
You can sign there
for the discharge grant.

49:47.480 --> 49:48.800
[pen scratching]

49:49.400 --> 49:50.800
It's Â£46.

49:51.480 --> 49:54.240
- You can count it if you like.
- Actually will.

50:23.720 --> 50:25.200
- What you saying?
- Yeah.

50:25.280 --> 50:26.320
Come on, man.

50:27.200 --> 50:29.200
- You good?
- Yeah, man. I'm good, how are you?

50:29.280 --> 50:31.200
- I'm all right.
- Good. Good, man.

50:31.280 --> 50:32.320
Looking big.

50:32.920 --> 50:35.160
[blows raspberry] Look at yourself, man.

50:36.280 --> 50:37.720
[Jason] What you saying, how was it?

50:38.760 --> 50:40.040
[Sully] Fucking shit.

50:41.080 --> 50:43.080
