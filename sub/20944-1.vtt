<i>I am a headhunter and I am
the purest form of salesman alive.</i>

00:42.135 --> 00:44.304
<i>I sell the American dream.</i>

00:44.346 --> 00:47.850
<i>I make money out of thin air,
smoke, whole cloth.</i>

00:47.892 --> 00:50.228
<i>I stand on the shoulders of giants,</i>

00:50.269 --> 00:52.396
<i>the hardest of hardened salesmen.</i>

00:52.438 --> 00:56.359
<i>Tin men, bible salesmen, slum realtors.</i>

00:56.400 --> 00:59.612
<i>We're a wolf pack of commissioned
phone jockeys working</i>

00:59.654 --> 01:03.074
<i>70 hours a week without a net.
You hit, you hit big.</i>

01:03.115 --> 01:05.534
<i>You blank, and the repo man's tailgating</i>

01:05.576 --> 01:07.411
<i>the minivan at the grocery store.</i>

01:07.453 --> 01:11.666
<i>This job is a desk, a phone,
a chair and your ass.</i>

01:13.250 --> 01:15.836
Good morning,
Imperial Automotive Manufacturing,

01:15.878 --> 01:17.172
Dottie speaking.

01:17.214 --> 01:19.216
<i>I am who I say I am.</i>

01:19.257 --> 01:20.217
Johnny Cobra calling, Dot.

01:20.217 --> 01:22.177
Need the name of your
Plant Manager, please.

01:22.219 --> 01:24.846
<i>I'm sorry, but it's
against company policy</i>

01:24.888 --> 01:27.641
to give out names of employees.
Nature of your business, sir?

01:27.683 --> 01:29.601
The nature of
my business, Dottie, is that

01:29.643 --> 01:31.186
I'm down here at the Nissan plant with

01:31.186 --> 01:33.898
a shut-down line costing me
ninety grand a minute

01:33.940 --> 01:36.734
because your Quality Department
thinks they can run a freightliner

01:36.776 --> 01:39.946
full of injection molded crap
down my goddamn throat!

01:39.988 --> 01:43.074
The person that you need to
speak to is Mr. Rayburn, I'll...

01:43.116 --> 01:45.118
First name, first name, first name.

01:45.159 --> 01:46.744
Thomas is his first name.

01:46.786 --> 01:48.455
Dottie./ What?

01:48.497 --> 01:50.665
Relax. Take a deep breath.
Pat yourself on the back,

01:50.707 --> 01:53.209
you're doing one helluva job./
<i>Well, thank you,</i>

01:53.251 --> 01:56.337
uh, Mr... did you say "Cobra"?

01:57.380 --> 01:58.506
Call me Johnny.

01:58.548 --> 02:01.676
Dot, tell me, what's the story on Tom?
Big guy, small guy,

02:01.718 --> 02:05.180
young, old, play sports, college boy,
what am I dealing with?

02:05.222 --> 02:07.516
I know Tommy does play golf a lot.

02:07.558 --> 02:10.185
He's been working here
a couple three years, probably...

02:10.227 --> 02:13.105
Oh, chitchat's over, Dot.
Boss is on my ass.

02:13.105 --> 02:14.523
Go on patch me through.

02:16.191 --> 02:18.819
Rayburn./ <i>Tom.</i>

02:18.861 --> 02:21.823
Dane Jensen, Blackridge Recruiting.
Thanks for taking my call.

02:21.865 --> 02:24.200
Yeah, hold up, hold up, bud.
Lemme save us both some time.

02:24.200 --> 02:26.745
I'm not lookin' to make
a move right just yet.

02:26.786 --> 02:29.122
Rough as things are out there,
I'm just happy to have the job

02:29.122 --> 02:31.458
I got.
Now I'm up to my ass in alligators

02:31.499 --> 02:34.294
so if you'll excuse me.../
Sweet. Baby. Jesus.

02:34.335 --> 02:37.339
I cannot believe my guy
was wrong about you.

02:37.381 --> 02:41.176
Scuse me? Your guy? What guy?/
This isn't a random call, Tom.

02:41.217 --> 02:43.636
I was told by a confidential source

02:43.678 --> 02:47.348
that even if your golf game was more
screwed up than a soup sandwich,

02:47.390 --> 02:50.268
you're one of the premier
Plant Managers in the South.

02:50.310 --> 02:53.439
He also told me even though
you've only been at Imperial

02:53.481 --> 02:55.316
for three years,
that you were bright enough

02:55.357 --> 02:57.193
to at least listen to
what I was recruiting for

02:57.193 --> 03:01.030
before making up your mind.

03:02.448 --> 03:06.452
So. You're a headhunter, huh?

03:06.494 --> 03:10.207
<i>I am a headhunter.
And a headhunter cometh.</i>

03:10.248 --> 03:13.418
What's the deal with this gut, son?

03:13.460 --> 03:16.588
You need to get some exercise,
buddy, you're starting to look like

03:16.630 --> 03:18.465
the kind of kid Willy Wonka'd kick out

03:18.507 --> 03:19.925
of the chocolate factory.

03:19.966 --> 03:21.468
Hands up.

03:21.510 --> 03:23.596
I dunno, we could play a little football

03:23.638 --> 03:25.973
when you get home tonight./
If it's still light out

03:26.015 --> 03:29.434
and I don't have
any calls to make, we'll see.

03:37.525 --> 03:40.238
Good morning./ <i>Hey, hon.</i>

03:40.279 --> 03:41.948
Ryan eat breakfast?

03:41.989 --> 03:44.951
If you can call it that./
He likes cereal and it's easy.

03:44.992 --> 03:48.371
Of course he does, Elise,
what kid doesn't like

03:48.412 --> 03:50.122
colored marshmallows
swimming in whole milk?

03:50.122 --> 03:52.208
It's a Momma.

03:55.379 --> 03:58.257
I like your hair, Lauren,

03:58.298 --> 04:00.842
looks good on you.

04:00.884 --> 04:03.929
The point is, he's a mess./
Shh! Be quiet, he'll hear you!

04:03.971 --> 04:06.640
Anyway, I made an appointment
for him to see the doctor.

04:06.682 --> 04:08.600
What the hell for, his weight?

04:08.642 --> 04:12.438
No! I told you a week ago, he's tired
all the time and those bruises...

04:12.480 --> 04:15.232
Bruises?/
Mom, can I have chocolate milk?

04:15.232 --> 04:18.777
Sure you can, baby./ Yeah, just a sec.

04:22.113 --> 04:24.908
Who's calling you so early?/
Just some candidate.

04:24.908 --> 04:27.537
Pushing sixty and wonders
why he can't find a job.

04:27.578 --> 04:30.623
Because of his age?
That's awful.

04:30.665 --> 04:31.582
Okay.

04:34.002 --> 04:35.294
Gotta go.

04:35.336 --> 04:37.338
I was thinking maybe
I could drive into the city,

04:37.380 --> 04:38.756
we could get lunch.

04:38.756 --> 04:43.595
First of the month, hon, swamped.
Call me! Oh.

04:51.103 --> 04:55.024
I'm done talking about it!
Either manage Bob to get a deal

04:55.274 --> 04:57.485
or make the son of a bitch
quit so I don't have to pay

04:57.527 --> 04:59.487
unemployment on his lazy ass.

04:59.529 --> 05:01.781
Ed, how do you propose
I force the man to quit?

05:01.823 --> 05:03.283
For Christ sake, Wilson,

05:03.324 --> 05:06.577
have a little fun for a change.

05:06.618 --> 05:09.747
You know what I love about this place?

05:09.788 --> 05:11.123
I'm on pins and needles.

05:11.165 --> 05:14.252
Ed only cares about making money.

05:14.294 --> 05:16.504
Man, woman, black, white, old or young,

05:16.546 --> 05:20.175
doesn't matter as long as
you're a producer.

05:20.216 --> 05:22.385
Bob, were you not here
this past Saturday or Sunday?

05:22.427 --> 05:25.346
No, I don't think anyone was here.

05:25.388 --> 05:28.601
You blanked for three months./
I got two kids,

05:28.642 --> 05:30.060
my wife had divorced me,

05:30.102 --> 05:31.812
I started coming in on the weekends.

05:31.854 --> 05:35.024
Ah, wife and two kids, I see.
You're gonna score in October?

05:35.065 --> 05:37.318
I'm sure gonna try my best.

05:37.359 --> 05:40.988
Try? Your attitude is to try?
Bob...

05:41.030 --> 05:42.406
You know what I hate about this place?

05:42.406 --> 05:43.616
Nope.

05:43.657 --> 05:46.328
Ed only cares about making money.

05:46.369 --> 05:47.788
That's why he tolerates you
and your mouthbreathers.

05:47.788 --> 05:50.582
My mouthbreathers make more placements

05:50.624 --> 05:53.626
and out-produce those Ivy Leaguers
you coddle every month.

05:53.667 --> 05:56.962
What about an attitude that says
"I'll do whatever it takes,

05:57.004 --> 05:59.381
"I'll work whatever hours necessary,

05:59.423 --> 06:04.804
in order to justify your
financial commitment to me, Ed"?

06:07.265 --> 06:10.018
Oh...

06:10.060 --> 06:13.605
Bob...

06:13.647 --> 06:17.235
Are you going to get a deal?!

06:17.276 --> 06:20.446
Yes! Yes, sir.

06:20.488 --> 06:24.242
Attaboy, Bob. Now get
the fuck back on the phone.

06:32.376 --> 06:35.712
Bet the place is full this weekend.

06:35.754 --> 06:39.967
But... if and when Bob leaves,

06:40.008 --> 06:41.926
then keep your ears open.

06:41.968 --> 06:43.928
If he breaches his non-compete

06:43.970 --> 06:46.305
and calls just one of our clients,

06:46.347 --> 06:48.058
I will sue him so deep and hard,

06:48.100 --> 06:50.269
that he, his wide-assed
Junior League wife,

06:50.310 --> 06:53.313
and their two brats will be
sleeping in a cardboard box

06:53.355 --> 06:55.774
under the overpass on Whacker.

06:55.816 --> 06:59.111
There's always someone
that thinks they can hang up

06:59.152 --> 07:01.947
their own shingle, and skip on
down to the home office

07:01.989 --> 07:05.118
in their skivvies and make
phone calls while the rug rats frolic

07:05.159 --> 07:08.454
at their feet. It makes me
want to puke blood.

07:08.496 --> 07:10.748
In 35 years,

07:10.790 --> 07:13.668
I have never let anyone
slide on their non-compete.

07:18.298 --> 07:20.759
I leave for Prague in two days.

07:20.801 --> 07:22.219
Prague?

07:22.261 --> 07:24.847
You want her to tell you where it is?

07:24.888 --> 07:29.392
I know where Prague is.
Overseas.

07:29.434 --> 07:33.104
I want to spend more time
away from the place, travel,

07:33.146 --> 07:36.900
indulge my inner Kerouac.

07:36.942 --> 07:39.695
Time to finalize that succession
plan that we dance around

07:39.737 --> 07:41.155
and never do anything about.

07:41.196 --> 07:43.991
I won't give up control immediately,

07:44.033 --> 07:46.493
but one of you will get the job.

07:46.535 --> 07:50.874
Whoever takes this last quarter
can move into the empty office

07:50.915 --> 07:53.626
next to this one.
You'll get off a desk

07:53.668 --> 07:55.003
and you'll receive overrides

07:55.045 --> 07:57.130
from every recruiter at Blackridge.

07:57.172 --> 08:01.342
I'll announce the new General Manager
the first of the year. Understood?

08:01.384 --> 08:03.803
One hundred percent, Ed./ Understood.

08:03.845 --> 08:07.850
Wilson, beat it.

08:24.283 --> 08:26.786
The hell is that?/ Cobra wine.

08:26.827 --> 08:31.040
Spotted it in a small village in Vietnam
last month, thought of you.

08:31.081 --> 08:33.333
You're supposed to drink it?/
Don't be such an American.

08:33.333 --> 08:34.919
Of course you drink it.

08:34.960 --> 08:38.298
But I'm determined to save it
for a special occasion.

08:38.340 --> 08:41.134
Maybe the next time I do
something truly remarkable.

08:41.176 --> 08:42.510
Such as?

08:42.552 --> 08:44.846
I haven't settled on that as yet.

08:44.888 --> 08:47.599
How about a record-breaking October?

08:47.641 --> 08:49.559
What makes a person remarkable
is the life they live,

08:49.559 --> 08:50.977
not the money they make.

08:51.019 --> 08:52.938
Spoken like a man with a lot of money.

08:54.857 --> 08:57.693
I may never uncork that wine.

08:58.736 --> 09:00.363
Ryan...

09:00.404 --> 09:02.907
Ryan, wake up, pal.

09:02.949 --> 09:06.326
What time is it?/ 6:30. Come on.

09:06.368 --> 09:09.205
Let's get some roadwork in
before school.

09:09.247 --> 09:10.748
Roadwork?

09:15.586 --> 09:18.464
Dad! I need to rest.

09:18.506 --> 09:21.175
Why don't I just carry you?

09:21.217 --> 09:24.846
I'm walking./ You're jogging.

09:24.888 --> 09:26.890
Morning, ladies!

09:31.645 --> 09:33.188
Alright.

09:33.230 --> 09:36.066
Let's just walk.

09:36.108 --> 09:38.944
Why don't we go to Catholic school?

09:40.863 --> 09:43.783
We're lapsed Catholics.

09:43.825 --> 09:45.159
The good Lord wants us to spend

09:45.201 --> 09:47.203
Sunday mornings at Cracker Barrel.

09:47.245 --> 09:49.622
I'm with the Lord.

09:51.541 --> 09:53.501
How come Lauren doesn't have to jog?

09:53.543 --> 09:55.962
'Cause Lauren doesn't have
to lose weight.

09:57.880 --> 10:00.508
First step in solving a problem
is recognizing it, buddy.

10:00.550 --> 10:03.011
Did you and Grandpa go jogging
when you were a kid

10:03.052 --> 10:06.389
in St. Louis?/ No, not hardly.

10:06.431 --> 10:07.849
He went to work when it was dark,

10:07.890 --> 10:09.017
came home when it was dark.

10:09.017 --> 10:11.311
Wasn't much fun, was he?

10:11.352 --> 10:14.023
Eh, he did the job.

10:15.774 --> 10:18.444
"Kinfe," "Sizhong," "Deepak",

10:18.485 --> 10:21.155
don't get me going on the red dots.

10:21.196 --> 10:22.740
Here's an invoice begging to be sent.

10:22.740 --> 10:26.035
"Ping."
Interview a Chinese engineer yet?

10:26.076 --> 10:28.538
Treat yourself. It's like having
a conversation in the dark

10:28.580 --> 10:30.415
with Astro from the Jetsons.

10:30.457 --> 10:33.168
Look, Sumner,

10:33.209 --> 10:34.711
I should have spent
more time with you, okay.

10:34.711 --> 10:36.046
My fault. Let's start over.

10:36.087 --> 10:39.090
We are the "Dixie Mafia."
Okay, Dixie.

10:39.132 --> 10:41.384
The South. You know,
state's rights, NASCAR,

10:41.426 --> 10:43.595
closeted atheists, poor spellers.

10:43.636 --> 10:45.013
I'm not an idiot, Mr. Jensen.

10:45.055 --> 10:47.891
Okay. Role-play with me, alright.

10:47.932 --> 10:50.018
I'm a client from
Hattiesburg, Mississippi and

10:50.060 --> 10:51.603
I'm looking for a process engineer.

10:51.644 --> 10:55.690
So go on, pitch me one of your PhD's.

10:55.732 --> 10:58.610
Ahem! Ring! Ring!

10:58.651 --> 11:01.947
Darrel Waltrip here!/
Uh, yes, Mr. Waltrip?

11:01.989 --> 11:04.617
Darrel, son.
What can I do you for?

11:04.658 --> 11:06.160
Well, Darrel, I'm calling about your...

11:06.160 --> 11:08.662
Who the hell is this?

11:08.704 --> 11:09.997
Sumner, Sumner Firestone
from Blackridge Recruiting.

11:09.997 --> 11:11.290
Spit it out, I'm a busy man!

11:11.332 --> 11:14.795
Uh... well, I've got a guy, he's uh,

11:14.836 --> 11:17.172
for your open engineering
position I mean,

11:17.214 --> 11:19.549
he's got two degrees in
Mechanical Engineering,

11:19.591 --> 11:21.134
experience reducing waste in the plants.

11:21.134 --> 11:22.803
Sounds stronger than puppy's breath.

11:22.844 --> 11:23.804
Now, when can he get down here?

11:23.804 --> 11:27.849
Well, he can be there Friday?/
You asking me or telling me?

11:27.891 --> 11:29.518
I'm telling you.
He'll be there Friday.

11:29.559 --> 11:32.104
Friday it is! By the by,

11:32.145 --> 11:35.065
he wouldn't happen to have
one of those PhD's, would he?

11:35.107 --> 11:36.525
As a matter of fact, he does.

11:36.566 --> 11:39.277
Perfect!
Better'n a new set of snow tires!

11:39.319 --> 11:41.947
Now, what's his name?

11:41.988 --> 11:45.242
Mohammed Al Far...

11:45.283 --> 11:48.412
Your sleeper-cell starter kits

11:48.454 --> 11:52.708
are unemployable south of the grit-line!

11:57.713 --> 12:01.425
Alright. Cowboy up, sunshine.

12:01.467 --> 12:04.471
Use this guy. Lou Wheeler.

12:04.555 --> 12:07.641
Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering,
Six Sigma experience,

12:07.683 --> 12:09.476
and an age-vague voice.

12:09.518 --> 12:12.229
"Age-vague"?/ Yeah. He's 59,

12:12.271 --> 12:14.857
sounds like he's 39, and
refuses to change the dates

12:14.898 --> 12:16.650
on his resume, and is unemployable.

12:16.692 --> 12:18.653
Why unemployable?

12:18.695 --> 12:22.906
He's 59 and refuses to lie about it.
God, you and my wife.

12:22.948 --> 12:25.701
Okay... so why do I want him?

12:25.742 --> 12:28.453
Because we will

12:28.495 --> 12:31.123
take 15 years off Lou's resume.

12:31.164 --> 12:32.499
Right, but once he goes
in for the interview,

12:32.499 --> 12:33.585
they'll just see how old he is, I mean,

12:33.585 --> 12:35.461
what's the point?

12:35.503 --> 12:36.754
We don't send him on an interview.

12:36.754 --> 12:39.549
Lou's what you call a Tracer Bullet.

12:39.591 --> 12:42.051
A tracer bullet, you know?

12:42.093 --> 12:43.177
A round that lights up

12:43.219 --> 12:45.054
so you know where to fire
the rest of the real bullets.

12:45.054 --> 12:47.348
I know what a tracer bullet is,
I just don't understand...

12:47.348 --> 12:48.891
..."Relatively Young Lou"

12:48.933 --> 12:50.686
is a sure-fire bet for
a phone interview, okay?

12:50.686 --> 12:53.439
But once he's off the line
with a paying customer,

12:53.480 --> 12:56.191
you bleed "Actually Old Lou"
for information.

12:56.233 --> 12:58.152
Like, "What projects
are they working on?"

12:58.193 --> 13:00.404
"What specifically did they ask you?"

13:00.446 --> 13:01.864
And you give that information

13:01.905 --> 13:03.616
to your placeable candidates
to prepare them.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.244
I don't know...

13:06.286 --> 13:08.996
We're headhunters, Sumner.

13:09.038 --> 13:11.832
In an economic shit storm.

13:11.874 --> 13:13.417
Now I can teach you how to count cards,

13:13.417 --> 13:14.668
but I can't make you do it.

13:14.710 --> 13:16.503
So you either reach deep inside

13:16.545 --> 13:18.839
and find that small
dark part of yourself

13:18.881 --> 13:21.801
that's predatory...
Or there's the door.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.391
Alright.

13:28.433 --> 13:31.853
Try giving yourself a desk name,
something tough, visual.

13:31.895 --> 13:34.939
Watch Wall Street,
Godfathers 1 and 2, not 3.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.360
Go on, get your phone, listen in.

13:41.197 --> 13:44.658
Bernadine?

13:44.700 --> 13:47.244
Hey, it's Dane.

13:47.286 --> 13:50.414
How are you, dear?
Is Lou around?

13:52.459 --> 13:54.669
Lou!

13:54.711 --> 13:58.756
Honey, Dane is on the phone!

14:03.344 --> 14:05.304
Hi, Dane!

14:05.346 --> 14:08.558
So, you hear anything from Superior?

14:08.600 --> 14:11.228
Are we gonna get that face-to-face?

14:11.269 --> 14:12.979
<i>Uh, I'm afraid not, Lou.</i>

14:13.021 --> 14:15.482
<i>They tell me they went
with the other guy.</i>

14:15.524 --> 14:17.818
<i>Now I told them they were
making a big mistake, but...</i>

14:17.859 --> 14:21.655
I'm sorry, Lou, I didn't get it done.

14:21.696 --> 14:24.784
Don't blame yourself,
we'll get 'em next time.

14:24.826 --> 14:27.662
Lou, I'm bringing in
another person to help.

14:27.703 --> 14:30.790
His name's Sumner Firestone,
he's a great guy.

14:30.832 --> 14:33.459
Recruiting savant.

14:33.501 --> 14:35.545
We have any other prospects
on the horizon that look good?

14:35.545 --> 14:37.672
No, not at the moment, Lou.

14:37.713 --> 14:39.258
But we are all over this.

14:39.299 --> 14:40.801
You call me when you
hear something, okay?

14:40.801 --> 14:44.471
<i>Will do.</i>

14:56.775 --> 14:59.778
So, how did it go?/ Oh, they uh,

14:59.820 --> 15:03.657
they decided to go with
the other candidate, no big deal.

15:03.699 --> 15:07.703
Thank heavens!/ What?

15:07.744 --> 15:11.291
I'm sorry, sweetie,
I know you were interested

15:11.332 --> 15:13.835
in doing this job, but...

15:13.877 --> 15:17.088
I was praying that
we wouldn't have to go to Mobile.

15:17.130 --> 15:20.258
I have no desire to see
a hurricane up close.

15:20.300 --> 15:22.510
Besides,

15:22.552 --> 15:25.263
after 29 years,

15:25.305 --> 15:29.685
I kinda like having you home with me.

15:29.727 --> 15:33.146
Bea, it's been nearly a year.

15:33.187 --> 15:36.107
And?

15:36.149 --> 15:39.027
Are you complaining?

15:46.744 --> 15:50.164
Three layoffs in eight months.
Your plant is dying.

15:50.205 --> 15:52.833
I can hear the death rattle from here.
And when it does,

15:52.875 --> 15:56.503
the only steady job you're gonna
find within a hundred miles

15:56.545 --> 15:59.174
of Elkhart won't require
an engineering degree,

15:59.215 --> 16:02.260
but a little blue vest and the phrase
"Hi, welcome to Walmart."

16:02.302 --> 16:04.512
What am I missing?

16:04.554 --> 16:06.014
<i>Time kills all deals, Eric.</i>

16:06.056 --> 16:07.766
<i>You're either on that plane
Friday morning</i>

16:07.807 --> 16:10.185
or reading about their new hire
not named Eric on Monday.

16:10.226 --> 16:11.770
<i>When I told him about your opportunity,</i>

16:11.770 --> 16:13.563
<i>he nearly crawled through the phone.</i>

16:13.605 --> 16:15.816
His wife's already looking at homes
and schools in Raleigh.

16:15.816 --> 16:18.694
Now is Friday morning better
for you or afternoon?

16:18.736 --> 16:20.279
He's an excellent surgeon.

16:20.321 --> 16:21.946
He's an excellent plastic surgeon.

16:21.988 --> 16:24.282
The grim reaper is coming
through the cornfield

16:24.324 --> 16:25.659
and he's half Mexican,

16:25.700 --> 16:27.535
half Chinese and
he doesn't take prisoners.

16:27.577 --> 16:29.955
That hole in his resume
is because he's been,

16:29.997 --> 16:32.124
he's been off the grid,
he's been, you know, working

16:32.166 --> 16:33.542
with Doctors Without Borders,

16:33.584 --> 16:35.878
he's in the Sudan
sowing up cleft palates.

16:35.920 --> 16:37.880
This is one of the best offers I've seen

16:37.922 --> 16:39.715
before or since a recession

16:39.757 --> 16:43.761
and it ends when I hang up this phone.
Now when can you start?

16:43.803 --> 16:46.390
One week or two?

16:57.526 --> 16:59.653
For Christ sakes, Elise!

16:59.694 --> 17:02.490
It's not battery acid!/
Where the hell did you get

17:02.532 --> 17:05.535
that idea from anyway?
You try it!

17:05.576 --> 17:09.288
Believe me, I would if I could.

17:09.329 --> 17:10.955
Well, maybe if I hadn't
already been down there

17:10.955 --> 17:13.040
for forty minutes already.

17:13.083 --> 17:14.459
Well, maybe if you did it more often,

17:14.459 --> 17:16.377
I wouldn't drag it out so long.

17:17.630 --> 17:19.298
Maybe if you didn't drag it out so long,

17:19.298 --> 17:20.675
I'd do it more often!

17:20.715 --> 17:22.718
You know, most women appreciate a man

17:22.760 --> 17:24.595
who's not a premature ejaculator.

17:24.637 --> 17:27.640
Sweetheart, when it comes to blowjobs,

17:27.682 --> 17:30.518
every woman appreciates a man
who's a premature ejaculator.

17:30.560 --> 17:34.440
Right./ I'm sorry.

17:34.481 --> 17:38.152
I said I'm sorry.
Look, I was fine with it until the end.

17:38.193 --> 17:42.281
I just wasn't expecting you
to ask me to do... that.

17:47.995 --> 17:53.793
I don't know, I just wanted to try
something a little different, that's all.

17:53.835 --> 17:57.505
My fault. Should've
pre-coached you on it.

17:57.547 --> 18:01.216
Well, I'm not one of your candidates.

18:05.847 --> 18:08.683
I'm just worried about Ryan.

18:08.725 --> 18:12.145
He's not himself./ Come on.

18:12.187 --> 18:14.480
There's nothing wrong with that kid

18:14.522 --> 18:17.859
that a little bit of sunshine
and sweat won't cure.

18:17.901 --> 18:21.697
I hope so.

18:21.739 --> 18:24.867
Isn't this nice?

18:24.909 --> 18:28.454
It's hardly ever just
the two of us, no kids,

18:28.495 --> 18:31.874
somebody wanting something.

18:31.916 --> 18:35.169
What would be nice is if I could cum.

18:35.211 --> 18:37.464
Dane Jensen.

18:37.505 --> 18:40.133
Last of the romantics.

18:40.175 --> 18:42.010
Don't you ever get tired
of the same old thing?

18:42.010 --> 18:46.056
No. No, I don't think
the same thing is old at all.

18:46.097 --> 18:47.681
I guess you do, though.

18:47.723 --> 18:50.851
What, are you kidding?
It's always the same thing.

18:50.893 --> 18:55.106
Please, not the sex talk./ Yeah.
We have sex once a week,

18:55.148 --> 18:58.109
except during your period,
and a negotiated blowjob

18:58.151 --> 19:01.404
at the beginning of the month.
We're in a rut, Lise.

19:01.446 --> 19:04.032
I'm just not as sexual as you are.

19:04.074 --> 19:05.241
Doesn't mean I don't love you.

19:05.241 --> 19:07.745
What a relief, that helps a lot.

19:07.787 --> 19:09.872
What do you want, Dane?

19:09.914 --> 19:12.541
Obviously I'm not giving you
what you want.

19:12.583 --> 19:15.920
I don't know, just... more.

19:15.962 --> 19:19.465
More? More what?

19:19.507 --> 19:23.929
Don't you ever just stop and think,

19:23.971 --> 19:26.473
"Is this it?
Is this all there is?"

19:26.515 --> 19:28.642
I don't just mean sex.

19:28.684 --> 19:31.728
I mean everything.

19:31.770 --> 19:35.439
A bigger house, a bigger job,

19:35.481 --> 19:38.067
a bigger... life.

19:38.109 --> 19:40.904
Maybe...

19:40.946 --> 19:44.449
Maybe if we spent more time
together out of the bedroom,

19:44.491 --> 19:46.993
we'd spend more time together in it?

19:55.670 --> 19:57.964
You can't just ignore me and then

19:58.005 --> 20:00.800
expect to have sex.
Foreplay doesn't begin

20:00.842 --> 20:04.971
in the bedroom./ Dr. Oz is an idiot.

20:05.012 --> 20:07.432
Dane, we never talk anymore.

20:07.473 --> 20:10.686
You come home, you're on your cell
or you're sending e-mails.

20:10.728 --> 20:12.146
It's the same thing every weekend,

20:12.146 --> 20:13.439
no wonder every day seems the same.

20:13.439 --> 20:14.898
It's my job, it's what I do.

20:14.940 --> 20:19.111
I remember the first time I got up
the nerve to tell you I loved you.

20:19.528 --> 20:22.573
Do you remember what you said?

20:22.614 --> 20:25.158
"What's not to love?"

20:25.199 --> 20:27.703
My God,

20:27.744 --> 20:32.124
you made me laugh! I'd never
met anyone so confident,

20:32.166 --> 20:35.627
so infuriating... so full of energy

20:35.669 --> 20:40.132
and life!/ How do you remember that?

20:42.093 --> 20:44.512
How do you not?

20:59.820 --> 21:02.490
The kids will want to go
as soon as you get home.

21:02.531 --> 21:05.534
Elise, I'll never get home
unless I get back on the phone.

21:05.576 --> 21:07.328
Do those look like Witch Fingers?

21:07.369 --> 21:09.246
Yeah! Yummy!

21:09.288 --> 21:10.789
Mom! Trick or treaters!/
Tell them to come back

21:10.789 --> 21:12.165
after it's dark!

21:12.207 --> 21:14.251
Elise?/ There's big kids at the door.

21:14.293 --> 21:16.545
What, like teenagers?
Costumes?

21:16.587 --> 21:17.421
No.

21:17.463 --> 21:20.883
Oh God, I hate that./
Elise, I'm hanging up.

21:21.133 --> 21:25.304
Ryan said he wants to walk
part of the way with his friends.

21:25.346 --> 21:28.642
Tell them no bones on the lawn./ Elise?

21:29.100 --> 21:32.229
But he wants to start with you
so he doesn't hurt your feelings.

21:32.270 --> 21:33.647
Elise, this is a client calling in,

21:33.647 --> 21:36.274
I gotta take it.
I'll see you in a bit, okay?

21:36.316 --> 21:38.193
Last day of the month, sunshine.
Whaddaya got?

21:38.193 --> 21:39.736
An offer./ Who and how much?

21:39.778 --> 21:42.239
Fee's 20,000. It's T.G. Duke
out of Raleigh, they make...

21:42.280 --> 21:43.198
Ball joints for the Koreans.

21:43.198 --> 21:44.659
Yeah. My guy's Brian Curtis,

21:44.700 --> 21:46.911
he's been downsized,
lives in Jasper, Alabama.

21:46.953 --> 21:49.163
The offer is for eighty grand.

21:50.581 --> 21:52.041
Give it to me.

21:52.083 --> 21:55.878
He got another offer on his own.
Hayes Manufacturing in...

21:55.920 --> 21:58.381
Jasper, Alabama.
Christ, why didn't you get him in there?

21:58.422 --> 22:00.425
I'm sorry! He saw an ad in the paper.

22:00.467 --> 22:03.678
As in "newspaper"?
You found the one guy in Alabama

22:03.719 --> 22:05.054
that reads a newspaper?

22:05.096 --> 22:07.181
Christ, Sumner,
you'd fuck up a ham sandwich.

22:07.223 --> 22:08.975
He said that his wife wouldn't
have to quit her job

22:08.975 --> 22:10.643
if he stayed local./ And?

22:10.685 --> 22:13.479
And he's probably gonna take Hayes.

22:13.521 --> 22:16.441
Probably?

22:16.483 --> 22:18.944
He's taking Hayes.

22:26.827 --> 22:29.121
This'll be your first deal, won't it?

22:29.162 --> 22:30.706
It would have.

22:30.747 --> 22:34.460
Look, Dane, I'm try... doing my best.

22:34.502 --> 22:36.587
You think up a desk name yet?

22:39.674 --> 22:41.634
Race Bannon.

22:48.475 --> 22:51.936
Send Brian an e-mail,
congratulating him on the job at Hayes.

22:51.978 --> 22:55.314
Encourage him
to get in touch immediately if

22:55.356 --> 22:58.234
his situation should
unexpectedly change.

22:58.276 --> 23:02.196
Then call the client.
Tell them that Brian is excited,

23:02.238 --> 23:04.533
grateful, and accepts the position.

23:04.575 --> 23:06.577
Now, get me the name
and home phone number

23:06.618 --> 23:08.120
of the Plant Manager at Hayes.

23:08.162 --> 23:09.913
What are you going.../
But before you do...

23:09.997 --> 23:12.124
Hang it./ What?

23:12.583 --> 23:15.085
You heard me.

23:15.127 --> 23:17.212
Put your deal on the board and

23:17.254 --> 23:20.341
ring... the fucking... bell.

23:20.383 --> 23:21.926
Based on what?
What are you gonna do?

23:21.968 --> 23:24.304
This deal guarantees

23:24.345 --> 23:28.391
that we win the month.
I want that production on today.

23:28.433 --> 23:30.560
Mr. Blackridge will fire me!

23:30.602 --> 23:32.854
I can't roll the dice on twenty grand!

23:32.896 --> 23:36.692
Race Bannon would.

23:37.859 --> 23:42.322
Ring it like you own it, Race.

24:57.276 --> 24:59.695
Richard Mercer?

24:59.736 --> 25:03.365
Same Richard Mercer
runs Hayes Manufacturing?

25:03.407 --> 25:07.911
Mr. Mercer, this is
Special Agent In Charge Paulson

25:07.953 --> 25:10.123
with the FBI.

25:10.164 --> 25:12.208
Yes, sir, that FBI.

25:12.250 --> 25:16.878
This call is in regards
to a Mr. Brian Curtis.

25:16.920 --> 25:20.507
Mr. Mercer, in accordance with
section 25-B of the Patriot Act

25:20.549 --> 25:23.802
we now notify employers
of their responsibilities

25:23.844 --> 25:27.181
and potential liabilities
when convicted sex offenders

25:27.223 --> 25:29.851
change jobs.

25:29.892 --> 25:32.979
Yes, sir, a pedophile.

25:33.021 --> 25:35.481
Well, ignorance of the law
doesn't relieve you

25:35.523 --> 25:37.692
of your legal obligations, sir,

25:37.734 --> 25:42.281
such as posting a sexual
predator notice with his photo

25:42.322 --> 25:44.783
in a high traffic area,

25:44.825 --> 25:47.870
say a cafeteria or lobby.

25:47.911 --> 25:50.205
Well, could you maybe
build him a little Quonset hut

25:50.247 --> 25:53.375
or Morton shed, let him
use that as an off...

25:53.417 --> 25:56.337
The cost of shed construction
was not part

25:56.379 --> 26:00.091
of the course work at Quantico.

26:00.133 --> 26:02.634
Well, that's your call,
Mr. Mercer. However...

26:02.676 --> 26:05.054
I should advise you of
the slight risk of a lawsuit

26:05.095 --> 26:07.347
if Mr. Curtis believes
you've discriminated

26:07.389 --> 26:09.892
against him. I'm no lawyer, sir,

26:09.933 --> 26:12.353
but I am the father of two little boys.

26:12.395 --> 26:16.274
Yes, sir, they were boys.

26:16.316 --> 26:18.860
A baker's dozen.

26:18.902 --> 26:20.779
Well, if you feel that strongly,

26:20.820 --> 26:23.823
my suggestion is that you
notify him that the position

26:23.865 --> 26:24.949
has been filled internally

26:24.949 --> 26:27.035
and forget I called.

26:29.246 --> 26:31.540
Well, you're welcome.

26:31.582 --> 26:34.251
Happy Halloween to you also, sir.

26:34.293 --> 26:36.504
God bless you too.

27:09.162 --> 27:12.332
Hey, buddy./ Hey, Dad.

27:12.374 --> 27:14.167
In bed a little early, aren't you?

27:14.209 --> 27:16.420
Mom said she was tired.

27:16.462 --> 27:20.174
She seem tired?/ Not at all.

27:25.596 --> 27:28.349
Scoot over.

27:28.391 --> 27:29.934
Another building, huh?

27:29.976 --> 27:32.563
Yeah. It's what I wanna do when I'm big.

27:32.604 --> 27:34.773
Draw skyscrapers and stuff.

27:34.815 --> 27:36.650
Right, right, you wanna be
an architect, huh?

27:36.650 --> 27:39.944
Build buildings?
That's decent money.

27:39.986 --> 27:42.280
Yeah, I just wanna draw them.
I don't even care

27:42.321 --> 27:43.698
how they're built.

27:43.739 --> 27:46.743
That's my boy. That's even better money.

27:46.785 --> 27:50.080
I'd like to go to the Art
Institute of Chicago.

27:50.122 --> 27:53.375
Oh yeah? Where'd you hear about that?

27:53.417 --> 27:58.255
My art teacher, Miss Jean,
she, um, she went there.

27:58.297 --> 27:59.965
She liked it a lot.

28:00.007 --> 28:02.176
And she's teaching fifth-grade art, huh?

28:02.218 --> 28:04.595
And first, too.

28:04.637 --> 28:07.098
Helluva testimonial for the brochure.

28:07.140 --> 28:10.184
She gave me a list
of her five favorite buildings

28:10.226 --> 28:13.604
in Chicago.

28:13.646 --> 28:15.440
Hey, where'd you get that bruise, sport?

28:15.481 --> 28:16.733
Where?

28:16.774 --> 28:21.196
There./ Hm. I don't know.

28:21.238 --> 28:25.117
"The Rookery,

28:25.159 --> 28:27.369
Tribune Tower,

28:27.411 --> 28:30.079
The Pritzker Pavilion, Wrigley Building,

28:30.121 --> 28:32.206
and Thomas Gale House."

28:32.248 --> 28:34.418
Thomas Gale? Hey!

28:34.460 --> 28:39.381
Lauren! Stay out of my room!
Get out of my bed!

28:39.423 --> 28:40.799
Lauren, you're knocking all my stuff.

28:40.799 --> 28:42.092
Dad, tell her to get out!

28:42.134 --> 28:45.012
Let's not wake your mother up, please.

28:45.054 --> 28:46.930
You missed trick or treating, Daddy.

28:46.972 --> 28:49.225
I know, I'm sorry, sweetie.

28:49.267 --> 28:51.978
I was a kitty cat./ I see that.

28:52.020 --> 28:54.814
Look at you./ What were you tonight?

28:54.856 --> 28:58.902
I was a headhunter./ Ooh! Awesome.

28:58.943 --> 29:00.987
He's kidding you, stupid,
he's always a headhunter.

29:00.987 --> 29:02.322
It's his job.

29:02.363 --> 29:05.618
I'm not stupid! You're stupid!/ Hey!

29:05.659 --> 29:08.412
Hey, hey, stop fighting, you two.
Come on...

29:09.705 --> 29:14.001
What do you do when
you're at where you work at?

29:14.043 --> 29:17.295
He helps other dads

29:17.337 --> 29:20.048
get jobs so they can
take care of their families.

29:20.090 --> 29:22.885
Something like that.

29:22.927 --> 29:26.263
Well, that's what Mom said you do.

29:28.516 --> 29:30.768
Mommy's mad at you.

29:59.173 --> 30:02.134
That's it?

30:02.176 --> 30:05.387
You just go to sleep?/ Guess not.

30:05.428 --> 30:08.558
You missed Halloween, Dane!/
I know, Elise, I'm sorry,

30:08.599 --> 30:11.561
I couldn't help it.
I had to make a call.

30:11.602 --> 30:13.896
You should have seen
the look on the kid's faces.

30:13.938 --> 30:16.232
Guilt doesn't work on me, Elise.
I had to make a call.

30:16.274 --> 30:18.985
A call. A call! You always
have to make a stinking call.

30:19.026 --> 30:22.321
If I was an O.B. would I have
to listen to "a baby, a baby,

30:22.363 --> 30:25.075
you always have to deliver a
stinking baby"? It's what I do.

30:25.117 --> 30:27.703
You think I wanted to miss tonight?

30:27.744 --> 30:29.371
That I like making those calls?

30:29.413 --> 30:32.207
I know you like making those calls!

30:32.249 --> 30:34.793
Sometimes I feel like you
don't really live here,

30:34.835 --> 30:36.253
you just sleep here.

30:36.295 --> 30:39.465
Like a favorite song.../ It's sad.

30:39.507 --> 30:42.844
It's just Halloween, Elise.

30:42.885 --> 30:45.096
How sad can a bunch of dressed-up kids

30:45.138 --> 30:46.973
with a bellyful of candy actually be?

30:47.015 --> 30:51.728
Sad for you, Dane.
You're missing it.

30:51.769 --> 30:53.979
Even when you're here
you're not really here.

30:54.021 --> 30:57.525
You're always thinking about
some deal you've got going,

30:57.567 --> 30:59.527
or some candidate you're scamming.

30:59.569 --> 31:04.407
One day, you're gonna wish
you had this time back.

31:04.449 --> 31:08.703
I love you and it makes me sad.
For you.

31:08.745 --> 31:11.915
I'm tired, Elise.

31:11.957 --> 31:14.835
What do you say we list
my flaws in the morning?

31:29.768 --> 31:32.812
You know, I work damn hard
for this family.

31:32.854 --> 31:36.024
I bust my ass seventy hours
a week in that boiler room

31:36.066 --> 31:38.610
to make enough money
so that you can stay at home.

31:38.651 --> 31:40.195
And I appreciate...

31:40.236 --> 31:41.945
You think it's easy
working commission sales?

31:41.945 --> 31:45.116
Cold calling?
Starting with a blank slate

31:45.158 --> 31:47.952
the first of every month?
Waking up at 2 AM

31:47.994 --> 31:51.748
with a knot in my gut hoping
to God I can close a deal?

31:51.790 --> 31:55.293
And all so my family
can have a nice life.

31:55.335 --> 31:58.089
And if that means
missing a fringe holiday

31:58.130 --> 32:00.591
and being the bad guy,
then that's a sacrifice

32:00.633 --> 32:02.635
I'm happy to make!/ Dane...

32:02.676 --> 32:07.598
Dane.../ I'm a goddamned American hero.

32:11.685 --> 32:14.856
You did not just call yourself
an American hero.

32:18.443 --> 32:21.571
I oversold it, didn't I?

32:25.575 --> 32:28.662
I can't even stay mad at you!

32:28.703 --> 32:31.790
You're such an asshole sometimes!

32:31.832 --> 32:36.128
Ow! Sometimes? Whoa!

32:36.169 --> 32:39.881
Get over here, American hero!

32:46.806 --> 32:50.184
Mrs. Jensen, your
pediatrician was correct

32:50.226 --> 32:52.687
to act so expeditiously.

32:52.728 --> 32:56.023
Ryan's blood tests show
a platelet level alarmingly low.

32:56.065 --> 32:59.026
We need to conduct
blood tests to determine...

32:59.068 --> 33:00.444
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute...

33:00.444 --> 33:02.656
Don't you think we might just be

33:02.698 --> 33:05.367
jumping the gun a bit?
My wife brings him in

33:05.409 --> 33:08.036
because he's probably got
some bug that he picked up

33:08.078 --> 33:10.622
from any one of a hundred kids
and we go straight from that...

33:10.664 --> 33:13.292
To this?

33:13.333 --> 33:15.419
Let's just step back a second, alright?

33:15.460 --> 33:17.088
I wish I had the luxury

33:17.130 --> 33:19.089
of time to step back, to be giving you

33:19.131 --> 33:21.884
the warm and furries. I don't.

33:21.925 --> 33:26.263
And, more importantly,
I suspect your son doesn't.

33:26.305 --> 33:28.849
He's probably just...
He's getting fat

33:28.891 --> 33:30.225
because he sits on his ass

33:30.267 --> 33:32.311
playing Assassin's Creed all day.

33:32.352 --> 33:35.064
He's not fat, Mr. Jensen.

33:35.106 --> 33:37.233
His spleen is swollen.

33:37.275 --> 33:40.653
What?

33:40.695 --> 33:42.947
My initial examination of Ryan

33:42.989 --> 33:46.910
revealed petechiae and purpura,
which you thought

33:46.951 --> 33:49.330
were bruises.

33:49.371 --> 33:51.957
He complains of chronic fatigue and...

33:51.999 --> 33:56.253
You did not notice
those signs?/ "Signs"?

33:56.295 --> 33:58.756
Of what...?

33:58.797 --> 34:02.343
I believe your son has A.L.L.

34:02.384 --> 34:04.804
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.

34:11.143 --> 34:14.271
"Believe?"
As in "guessing?"

34:14.313 --> 34:16.315
As in "I don't really know
what he's got?"

34:16.357 --> 34:19.735
"Believe" as in "based on 233 children

34:19.777 --> 34:21.987
I've treated with A.L.L."

34:22.030 --> 34:25.158
You see, the good news is
that it's the most common

34:25.199 --> 34:26.701
form of childhood cancer

34:26.743 --> 34:29.161
and we have a great deal
of experience treating it.

34:29.204 --> 34:31.623
The realistic news is that it gets worse

34:31.665 --> 34:34.208
very quickly if left untreated.

34:34.250 --> 34:38.089
You... believe it's this A.L.L.

34:38.130 --> 34:42.217
but you're not sure, how could you be?

34:42.259 --> 34:46.097
Right? He could be fine?

34:46.138 --> 34:48.766
Whatever his condition, Mrs. Jensen,

34:48.808 --> 34:51.103
he is not fine.

34:57.483 --> 35:01.028
Alright, Ryan.

35:01.070 --> 35:04.573
You can hop out now, buddy.
Sorry, hospital policy.

35:04.615 --> 35:07.327
Sure somebody's not using this room?

35:07.369 --> 35:10.539
Oh, my bad. Those are Billy's,
he's not with us anymore.

35:11.915 --> 35:15.502
He went home Monday!
He got better in no time,

35:15.544 --> 35:17.671
just like you will, right?

35:17.712 --> 35:22.342
Hey! Look, Rhino, you got your own TV.

35:22.384 --> 35:25.054
Better than being at home, huh?/
Yeah, his own TV,

35:25.096 --> 35:28.850
private bathroom, and oh!

35:28.891 --> 35:31.686
If you push this, you not
only get to control the TV,

35:31.727 --> 35:33.020
but you get your very own

35:33.062 --> 35:35.731
room-service button too, huh./ What?

35:35.773 --> 35:39.361
I think I'm gonna have to catch
a little leukemia myself.

35:41.655 --> 35:44.991
Well, I don't know about that,
Dad, but I'm an aide,

35:45.032 --> 35:48.661
so a nurse will be here any sec, you guys
need anything, you just holler at me.

35:48.703 --> 35:49.662
My name's Antoine.

35:49.704 --> 35:51.164
Okay./ Alright?

35:51.205 --> 35:53.749
See you later, bud./ Thanks.

36:10.810 --> 36:13.313
Hey, Dad?/ Yeah?

36:13.354 --> 36:15.732
When's Mom coming back?

36:15.773 --> 36:18.526
She'll be back as soon as she
finishes the insurance paperwork

36:18.568 --> 36:21.487
downstairs.

36:54.521 --> 36:57.275
With the insurance that we have now,

36:57.317 --> 36:59.861
the cost of my medication alone,

36:59.903 --> 37:05.075
is as much as a car payment.
Your dad, he's...

37:05.116 --> 37:08.161
He's trying so hard, but...

37:08.203 --> 37:10.538
I'm very worried.

37:10.580 --> 37:14.293
Thank you, sweetheart,
and thank Greg for me,

37:14.335 --> 37:18.005
and please make sure you
let him know it's just a loan.

37:18.047 --> 37:22.258
Okay, kiss the grandkids for me.

37:24.344 --> 37:26.471
Daddy?/ Yeah?

37:26.513 --> 37:28.724
When will Mommy and Ryan be home?

37:28.766 --> 37:31.686
Oh...

37:31.727 --> 37:35.690
Mommy and Ryan are
staying at the hospital,

37:35.731 --> 37:38.234
but they'll be home soon
when Ryan feels better.

37:38.275 --> 37:40.861
Hm?

37:40.903 --> 37:44.031
Grandma Inez is gonna come
stay with us, though.

37:44.073 --> 37:48.662
You and Nathan will
like that, won't you? Okay.

37:48.704 --> 37:50.914
Alright.

37:50.956 --> 37:53.834
Goodnight, sweetie.

37:57.462 --> 38:01.050
Daddy?/ Yeah?

38:01.092 --> 38:04.387
I forgot to brush my teeth.

38:04.429 --> 38:06.973
Let me see 'em.

38:08.641 --> 38:12.227
They're baby teeth.
They're all gonna fall out anyway.

38:12.269 --> 38:15.522
Go to sleep, pumpkin.

38:43.010 --> 38:46.054
Dane Jensen./ <i>Sorry I'm calling so late.</i>

38:46.096 --> 38:48.057
Hey, Lou.

38:48.099 --> 38:51.478
It's just that I haven't heard
from you or this Firestone fella

38:51.519 --> 38:54.647
in a while.
You know how it is.

38:54.689 --> 38:57.858
Wife's gettin' tired of me
hangin' around the house all the time.

38:57.900 --> 39:01.778
What can I do for you, Lou?/ Well,

39:01.820 --> 39:05.033
if you come across any entry
level engineer openings,

39:05.074 --> 39:07.368
I'd like to hear about it.

39:07.410 --> 39:09.579
You know, maybe we can
both make some money.

39:09.621 --> 39:12.165
Companies don't pay us to recruit

39:12.207 --> 39:13.917
for entry level engineers.

39:15.835 --> 39:18.296
I'm sorry, man. I've been having
some personal problems.

39:18.338 --> 39:20.132
What do you say we pick
this up in the morning?

39:20.132 --> 39:21.759
Everything alright?

39:21.800 --> 39:24.428
Yeah, yeah... family issues.
I'll figure it out.

39:24.470 --> 39:28.140
Wanna talk about it?/
Do I want to talk about it?

39:28.182 --> 39:32.937
Dane, I've got three kids,
two daughters and a son.

39:32.978 --> 39:35.565
They're all grown-up now,
but they were a handful.

39:35.607 --> 39:38.068
Two grandkids. I've been married

39:38.109 --> 39:40.445
29 years, and it hasn't always
been a walk in the park.

39:40.487 --> 39:44.908
<i>Maybe I can help.</i>/ Ah, it's okay, Lou.

39:44.950 --> 39:48.118
I'm handling it.
I'll corral Sumner,

39:48.160 --> 39:51.122
and he'll be back in the hunt
first thing in the AM, okay?

39:51.164 --> 39:54.459
You take your time,
do what you gotta do.

39:54.501 --> 39:58.630
Don't worry about me.
It's all good here. But, Dane?

39:58.672 --> 40:01.800
Yeah?/ Remember something...

40:01.841 --> 40:06.222
Every family has its issues.
But you only have one family.

40:06.263 --> 40:09.976
Like it, Lou. Like it.

40:10.017 --> 40:13.270
Take care.

40:13.312 --> 40:15.815
You too.

40:35.459 --> 40:38.922
Ryan, look who's here!/ Hey, Dad.

40:38.964 --> 40:42.426
Rhino, how you doing, buddy?

40:42.467 --> 40:46.179
Fine.

40:46.221 --> 40:48.849
He's almost asleep.
This is when you show up?

40:48.890 --> 40:52.602
Dr. Singh was in earlier./ And?

40:52.644 --> 40:55.648
And I need you here to help ask

40:55.690 --> 40:57.316
the questions I don't always know which

40:57.358 --> 40:59.736
questions to ask him./
Alright, alright, calm down.

40:59.777 --> 41:01.195
I'm gonna go get something to eat.

41:01.237 --> 41:02.989
You'll be here a while?

41:03.030 --> 41:05.158
Yeah. Where else would I be, Elise?

41:05.199 --> 41:08.161
I'll be right back, baby.

41:08.202 --> 41:09.955
Okay, Mom.

41:21.091 --> 41:23.384
She gone?

41:23.426 --> 41:27.097
Yeah. Yeah, she's gone.

41:27.139 --> 41:29.725
She stares at me all day.

41:29.766 --> 41:33.020
Like one of those vultures
on Animal Planet.

41:38.317 --> 41:40.904
She's scared.

41:49.454 --> 41:53.333
Yes, sweetie, well, I'm doing
the best that I can, okay?

41:53.374 --> 41:56.629
Then tell him, just tell him
I'm gonna be there for lunch.

41:56.670 --> 42:00.007
Yes, Lise, I'm leaving now.

42:00.049 --> 42:03.052
Okay, I'll see you then. Bye.

42:06.096 --> 42:08.807
Yup./ Mr. Jensen?

42:08.849 --> 42:13.103
I have Mr. Blackridge for you.

42:13.145 --> 42:16.023
Put him through.

42:16.065 --> 42:18.025
Hey! How's Prague?

42:18.067 --> 42:21.695
Give me the number, fucknuts./
Just north of one-fifty.

42:21.737 --> 42:24.907
Halfway through the month?
Christ, Jensen.

42:24.949 --> 42:29.079
Is Wilson at her desk or is she
moving her shit into my office?

42:29.120 --> 42:32.582
Kafka was right. Prague just
won't seem to let me go.

42:32.624 --> 42:36.378
Tell me about Ryan./ He's much improved.

42:36.419 --> 42:40.048
Should I be worried?/ No. No, he's...

42:40.090 --> 42:43.302
Put Wilson on. I want to make
sure she mailed Bob a copy

42:43.344 --> 42:45.263
of his non-compete.

42:45.304 --> 42:52.144
Hey. I got Ed for you.

42:52.186 --> 42:54.438
I checked on your Dr. Singh.

42:54.480 --> 42:57.108
He's a heavy hitter, one of the best.

42:57.149 --> 42:58.567
Thanks, Lynn.

42:58.609 --> 43:00.278
I got you an early Christmas present.

43:00.319 --> 43:02.446
In your "throw-down" drawer.

43:10.871 --> 43:13.833
I'm about to shove November
straight up your ass.

43:17.379 --> 43:19.339
Wish I'd done that.

43:19.381 --> 43:22.259
Which one of you meat-eaters

43:22.300 --> 43:24.886
is getting an interview today!? Come on!

43:33.396 --> 43:35.481
Mr. Jensen.

43:36.733 --> 43:38.693
What's up, doc?

43:38.735 --> 43:41.404
I've heard that before.

43:41.446 --> 43:43.781
You're here late.

43:43.823 --> 43:47.703
I spoke with your wife earlier.

43:47.745 --> 43:50.496
Your son's initial response to chemo is

43:50.538 --> 43:52.999
less than encouraging.

43:53.041 --> 43:54.834
Meaning what?

43:54.876 --> 43:57.462
We should discuss options
still available to us...

43:57.503 --> 44:00.006
Still available? "Still"?

44:00.047 --> 44:03.385
Gene therapy. Using viruses

44:03.427 --> 44:06.346
to alter Ryan's T cells
and attack the cancer.

44:06.388 --> 44:09.391
I've had excellent success
in a handful of cases

44:09.433 --> 44:11.643
using measles, the common cold...

44:11.685 --> 44:15.314
You want to treat Ryan's cancer

44:15.355 --> 44:18.693
with, what... measles?

44:18.735 --> 44:21.863
HIV. An engineered form.

44:21.905 --> 44:26.701
We're not in some
third world country, no offense.

44:26.743 --> 44:31.289
This is Chicago.
We're in a state-of-the-art hospital!

44:31.331 --> 44:33.542
What do we need to do to

44:33.584 --> 44:37.003
in the realm of non-bat shit
treatments-to turn this around?

44:37.045 --> 44:40.882
Cancer is not a negotiation, Mr. Jensen.

44:42.717 --> 44:45.303
Goodnight.

45:19.881 --> 45:23.427
So, focus on his multiplication tables.

45:23.469 --> 45:26.221
Try and make a game out of it./ Okay.

45:26.263 --> 45:29.182
Ryan knows what to do
with these worksheets.

45:29.224 --> 45:33.395
Shh, shh, shh! Quiet study.

45:33.436 --> 45:35.564
Here we go.

45:35.605 --> 45:38.234
When you...

45:38.276 --> 45:41.279
If you need more, I can always

45:41.320 --> 45:43.281
send them home with Lauren.

45:46.284 --> 45:48.828
This is from all of us.

45:48.869 --> 45:51.580
Thank you. Okay.

45:51.622 --> 45:53.792
Okay, sweetheart.

45:58.714 --> 46:02.301
Okay. Let's talk about
the Continental Congress.

46:02.342 --> 46:05.262
Who can tell me what
that is?/ Excuse me.

46:05.304 --> 46:08.349
Whose paper towels are those?

46:08.391 --> 46:10.351
They belong to the class...

46:10.393 --> 46:14.229
Could we maybe put them someplace else?

46:14.271 --> 46:16.106
Mrs. Jensen, they're just...

46:16.148 --> 46:18.942
I know that the kids
need Kleenex, I just

46:18.984 --> 46:22.696
don't think they need
to be on Ryan's desk.

46:25.283 --> 46:27.577
Mrs. Jensen, no one's using the desk.

46:27.618 --> 46:29.912
Uh, sweetie, do you have room
in your own desk for these?

46:29.912 --> 46:33.249
Hey, give me that./ Uh...

46:34.375 --> 46:37.795
Take it easy, lady! Geez!

46:37.837 --> 46:40.382
Keep your shit off my kid's desk!

46:50.601 --> 46:55.231
Okay.

47:48.620 --> 47:49.955
Good to go, little man.

47:49.996 --> 47:53.249
What's going on?
Where's he going?

47:53.290 --> 47:56.335
209, South LaSalle.

48:09.975 --> 48:12.435
Come on,

48:12.477 --> 48:15.523
let's get you inside.

48:15.565 --> 48:18.150
"Completed in 1888,

48:18.192 --> 48:21.821
"the Rookery was designed
by architects Burnham and Root.

48:21.862 --> 48:25.616
It's the oldest high-rise
still standing in Chicago."

48:32.583 --> 48:35.752
Dane Jensen. Wyatt!

48:35.794 --> 48:38.297
Talk to me, babe.

48:38.338 --> 48:40.590
Sure they've got problems at the plant,

48:40.631 --> 48:42.508
is there a manufacturing company
in America that doesn't?

48:42.508 --> 48:43.593
Dad?

48:43.634 --> 48:46.847
Wyatt? Yeah, hold on a sec.

48:46.888 --> 48:50.142
Thanks. What's up, buddy?/
Daniel Burnham?

48:50.183 --> 48:53.854
One of the guys who designed
this place? He said this,

48:53.895 --> 48:57.232
"Make no little plans,

48:57.274 --> 49:00.485
they have no magic to stir men's blood."

49:00.527 --> 49:03.156
Cool.

49:03.197 --> 49:06.242
Stir men's blood!

49:08.161 --> 49:11.831
Wyatt? Yeah, listen...
Yeah, I was having lunch

49:11.873 --> 49:16.210
one day in Talladega with
Richard Petty when... yeah,

49:16.252 --> 49:20.382
that Richard Petty.
Anyway, King Richard says to me...

49:20.424 --> 49:22.801
"Make no little plans, Dane,

49:22.843 --> 49:26.305
for they have no magic
to stir the blood."

49:26.347 --> 49:28.097
Well, I'll tell you what it means.

49:28.139 --> 49:30.308
It means if you want to continue

49:30.350 --> 49:34.396
to work a safe comfortable job,
then by all means stay at Rycon.

49:34.438 --> 49:36.440
But if you want a challenging position,

49:36.482 --> 49:38.609
one that will not only
define your career,

49:38.650 --> 49:41.987
but define you as a leader
of men, then this...

49:42.029 --> 49:45.282
This... is your chance!

49:45.324 --> 49:48.495
Well, of course if the money's right.

49:48.536 --> 49:51.456
Forget who you're talking to?

49:56.836 --> 49:59.047
Wyatt?

49:59.089 --> 50:02.050
I'll call you back.

51:11.998 --> 51:16.335
Mmm! Mom, I think our boy's
doing 100% better today.

51:16.377 --> 51:18.880
Some days are good, some days
are bad, but today...

51:18.921 --> 51:20.673
Is a good day.

51:20.715 --> 51:23.302
That's right. So, did they
bring your lunch up for you yet?

51:23.343 --> 51:25.262
Uh, no.
My dad's coming.

51:25.304 --> 51:26.680
Okay.

51:26.722 --> 51:28.015
I asked him if we could go somewhere.

51:28.015 --> 51:31.393
Nice./ Did you want to come, Mom?

51:31.435 --> 51:34.271
No. No, Nathan needs to see his mother.

51:34.313 --> 51:36.648
Besides, it's you and your dad's thing.

51:39.527 --> 51:41.946
Are you gonna be okay if I get going?

51:41.988 --> 51:43.364
Your dad will be here any minute.

51:43.406 --> 51:46.326
Sure.

51:46.367 --> 51:50.163
Do you know how much I love you?

51:52.331 --> 51:54.917
My first baby.

51:54.959 --> 51:57.253
You made me a mother.

51:57.295 --> 51:59.672
You taught me how to be a mom

51:59.714 --> 52:02.425
to Lauren and Nate./ I'll be okay, Mom.

52:02.467 --> 52:04.844
What?

52:04.886 --> 52:07.013
Of course you will!

52:07.055 --> 52:11.685
Silly.

52:15.230 --> 52:18.400
Have fun.

53:00.736 --> 53:04.031
You closing a deal without me?

53:04.073 --> 53:06.742
Huh? Michigan Avenue ain't coming to us.

53:15.418 --> 53:17.379
"The Tribune Tower,

53:17.420 --> 53:19.756
"designed in 1922

53:19.798 --> 53:22.092
by Howells and Hood."

53:24.010 --> 53:27.222
Huh. Listen, Rhino,
"More than 100 rock fragments

53:27.264 --> 53:29.933
from famous sites around
the world are embedded

53:29.975 --> 53:31.518
into the walls of the Tower."

53:31.560 --> 53:33.562
Look! The Alamo.

53:33.603 --> 53:36.523
Look, Edinburgh castle...

53:36.565 --> 53:40.443
Taj Mahal...
Great Wall of China? Are you kidding me?

53:43.488 --> 53:46.576
Is that one from
that building in New York?

53:46.617 --> 53:50.830
Sure enough.

53:50.872 --> 53:53.958
Where were we when that happened?

53:54.000 --> 53:57.128
We?

53:57.170 --> 54:00.382
You weren't even born yet.

54:02.634 --> 54:05.387
Someone heard a plane
hit the Trade Center.

54:05.429 --> 54:08.223
We thought it was an accident.

54:08.265 --> 54:11.226
Until the second one.

54:13.145 --> 54:15.732
We all stood and watched
on a TV in the conference room

54:15.773 --> 54:18.108
as the towers fell.

54:18.150 --> 54:20.110
Were you sad?

54:20.152 --> 54:23.614
For the people in the buildings, yeah.

54:23.655 --> 54:25.282
For little boys like you...

54:25.324 --> 54:27.826
who wouldn't see their
moms and dads again.

55:04.366 --> 55:08.494
Do you have to go back to work now?

55:08.535 --> 55:12.915
Yeah... I do.

55:24.052 --> 55:28.223
Okay, last but not least.

55:28.264 --> 55:31.267
So nice. Oh, wait, wait. Hold on.

55:31.309 --> 55:34.396
I thought it would be nice
if we went around the table

55:34.438 --> 55:36.232
and everyone could say something

55:36.273 --> 55:37.983
that they're thankful for.

55:38.025 --> 55:40.653
Oh, that's a great idea./
You know, it's Dane's house.

55:40.695 --> 55:43.239
Why don't you go first?/ Yeah.

55:44.907 --> 55:48.202
Well, I'm, uh,

55:48.244 --> 55:52.457
thankful for...

55:55.418 --> 55:58.087
Excuse me.

56:00.923 --> 56:04.718
What a cornholing.
Wow, is she reaming your ass.

56:04.760 --> 56:08.140
How much more you gonna
put on for the month?

56:08.181 --> 56:11.143
I've probably got another fifteen.

56:11.184 --> 56:12.978
You don't want the job? That it?

56:13.019 --> 56:15.188
Yes, yes, I want the job, Ed.

56:15.230 --> 56:18.150
You like working a desk then./
No, I don't.

56:18.191 --> 56:20.944
You've got roughly four weeks.
Fond of you or not,

56:20.986 --> 56:23.406
I'm voting with my wallet, we clear?

56:23.448 --> 56:25.283
Yeah.

56:28.911 --> 56:33.040
How's our boy?/ He's good.

56:33.082 --> 56:36.043
Thanksgiving?/ Uneventful.

56:36.085 --> 56:40.007
Why didn't you ever marry, Ed?

56:40.048 --> 56:43.593
Have kids, do the whole family thing?

56:43.634 --> 56:47.305
I know me. I know I'm
the most interesting person

56:47.346 --> 56:48.931
you've ever met.

56:48.973 --> 56:51.601
And the most selfish.
I only want what I want.

56:51.642 --> 56:55.564
Ever regret it?/ You mean like

56:55.606 --> 56:58.192
when it's Thanksgiving
and I'm here at the office...

56:58.233 --> 56:59.902
talking with fucknuts...

56:59.943 --> 57:02.863
instead of being surrounded
by people who give a shit?

57:02.905 --> 57:06.658
Yeah, maybe... But then again,

57:06.700 --> 57:09.537
you're not flying to Manhattan

57:09.579 --> 57:12.957
with a $5,000-a-night Brazilian
who's gonna turn your suite

57:12.999 --> 57:15.668
at the Carlyle into
a sexual Slip 'n Slide.

57:17.462 --> 57:20.089
See ya on Monday, kid.

57:30.601 --> 57:34.020
I had to take it... Ed.

57:34.062 --> 57:35.897
No, you didn't.
It's Thanksgiving.

57:35.939 --> 57:37.231
To Ed it's Thursday.

57:37.273 --> 57:40.361
To you it's Thursday!

57:40.402 --> 57:44.114
We're your family, Dane!
Those people in that room! Not Ed!

57:44.156 --> 57:46.617
This is my chance
to get off a desk, Elise.

57:46.659 --> 57:48.118
This is the job...

57:48.160 --> 57:51.163
I am so sick of your
"this is the job" excuse!

57:51.205 --> 57:53.666
Well, fine! You don't want me
to work so much? Great!

57:53.707 --> 57:56.086
After dinner, we'll put
your resume together...

57:56.127 --> 57:57.337
and you go get a job!

57:57.379 --> 57:59.756
Hmm? "Elise Katherine Jensen!

57:59.798 --> 58:03.176
"Ten years' experience
as a stay-at-home mom!

58:03.218 --> 58:07.013
Skilled in potty training,
play dates, and Pinterest!"

58:07.055 --> 58:10.183
Oh yeah, the job market's
just gonna snap you up!

58:10.225 --> 58:12.687
Hey, maybe you can go down
to St. Cecilia's,

58:12.728 --> 58:14.897
see if they'll buy that
"Doctor Mom" bullshit...

58:14.939 --> 58:16.273
and put you on the payroll.

58:16.315 --> 58:19.235
Then you can spring
for the cranberry sauce,

58:19.276 --> 58:22.737
or the white quartz
you just had to have,

58:22.779 --> 58:24.739
or the clothes you wear,

58:24.781 --> 58:27.492
or, or the ten grand "loan"

58:27.535 --> 58:29.203
we gave your brother two years ago...

58:29.245 --> 58:31.455
that he seems to have forgotten about.

58:31.497 --> 58:34.875
Hell, Elise, look how lucky we are,
we don't ever have

58:34.917 --> 58:36.419
to tell the kids there's no Santa...

58:36.460 --> 58:38.713
because as long
as I can magically continue

58:38.754 --> 58:41.048
to pull the mortgage out of my ass,

58:41.090 --> 58:43.343
I'm Santa fucking Claus 365 days a year!

58:56.022 --> 59:00.194
I lost the month, Elise.

59:00.236 --> 59:02.947
I took October,

59:02.989 --> 59:05.491
lost November.

59:05.533 --> 59:08.118
Driving around Chicago,
touring buildings

59:08.160 --> 59:10.704
instead of closing deals.

59:10.745 --> 59:13.498
Now I've got December to get Ed's job,

59:13.540 --> 59:18.880
and Christmas to New Year's
is a deal-killing nightmare.

59:23.509 --> 59:27.263
I'm sorry that you think
I've taken you for granted.

59:29.891 --> 59:33.520
I know you work hard for us.

59:33.562 --> 59:37.316
And you're probably right, Dane,

59:37.357 --> 59:41.111
the job that I could find
is not what you or Ed

59:41.153 --> 59:43.822
would consider worthwhile.

59:43.864 --> 59:47.744
My skills are not what anyone

59:47.785 --> 59:51.164
would consider "marketable."

59:55.084 --> 59:58.795
But I know how to prioritize.

01:00:20.819 --> 01:00:23.030
You okay over there?

01:00:23.072 --> 01:00:24.865
No.

01:00:59.859 --> 01:01:04.155
Holy crap./ Words right outta my mouth.

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:29.474
What do we know?/
The designer is Frank Gehry.

01:01:29.516 --> 01:01:32.477
The guy also did a museum in Spain,

01:01:32.519 --> 01:01:36.022
and he probably did
some other stuff too...

01:01:36.063 --> 01:01:40.026
But I do remember a quote of his.

01:01:40.068 --> 01:01:44.197
"When everybody else
is ready for the ending,

01:01:44.239 --> 01:01:46.533
I'm just ready to begin."

01:01:46.575 --> 01:01:50.662
I like Frank.

01:01:50.704 --> 01:01:54.709
Me too, buddy.

01:01:54.751 --> 01:01:57.420
Hey, Dad?

01:01:57.462 --> 01:02:00.131
Yeah?

01:02:00.173 --> 01:02:04.260
Do you believe in God?

01:02:08.265 --> 01:02:11.435
Depends on the month I'm having.

01:02:11.477 --> 01:02:14.313
Me too.

01:02:20.694 --> 01:02:23.947
Did you have a girlfriend
when you were as old as me?

01:02:25.866 --> 01:02:29.787
Why do you ask?

01:02:29.828 --> 01:02:34.333
Cause there's this girl
in my class. Her name

01:02:34.374 --> 01:02:36.627
is Shawna.

01:02:36.668 --> 01:02:40.673
I think she likes me.

01:02:42.884 --> 01:02:45.178
Shawna, huh?

01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:47.931
Sounds exotic.

01:02:52.352 --> 01:02:55.814
<i>He'll get worse before he gets better...</i>

01:02:55.856 --> 01:02:57.107
<i>Worse?! How can he...</i>

01:02:57.149 --> 01:02:58.984
<i>Ryan's cancer is unusually aggressive.</i>

01:02:59.026 --> 01:03:00.194
<i>Virus!/ HIV.</i>

01:03:00.236 --> 01:03:02.905
<i>He's telling us our boy's going to die.</i>

01:03:02.947 --> 01:03:04.949
<i>Don't you get it? Jesus, Dane,
what are we going to do?</i>

01:03:04.949 --> 01:03:06.784
<i>Cancer is not a negotiation, Mr. Jensen.</i>

01:03:10.079 --> 01:03:12.873
No, twenty people lose
their job, it's a layoff.

01:03:12.915 --> 01:03:14.625
Just you, it's a termination.

01:03:14.667 --> 01:03:16.627
I told you that before the interview.

01:03:16.669 --> 01:03:18.212
The top end is 70.

01:03:18.254 --> 01:03:20.714
Forty years old,
a wife and three kids...

01:03:20.756 --> 01:03:22.341
how do you not pass a drug test?

01:03:22.383 --> 01:03:24.635
When I started recruiting
on this, you told me

01:03:24.677 --> 01:03:26.136
there were five must-haves for this job.

01:03:26.136 --> 01:03:29.557
Your guy has one.
Maybe. I can't justify the fee.

01:03:30.517 --> 01:03:32.936
It's about three now,

01:03:32.978 --> 01:03:35.188
so I expect he'll be back
from his meeting...

01:03:35.230 --> 01:03:37.482
I don't know, maybe five?/
Would you ask Lou

01:03:37.524 --> 01:03:39.776
to call me when he's...

01:03:39.818 --> 01:03:42.571
Uh, what kind of meeting is it?

01:03:42.613 --> 01:03:46.033
He got a call from another
head... from another recruiter.

01:03:46.075 --> 01:03:48.953
It was just last night./ Bernadine?

01:03:48.995 --> 01:03:50.079
Hello?

01:03:50.121 --> 01:03:52.123
Bernadine, hey./ Dane.

01:03:52.164 --> 01:03:56.043
Bernadine? Hello?/ Sumner tells me

01:03:56.085 --> 01:03:57.712
Lou has an interview?
That's wonderful!

01:03:57.753 --> 01:04:00.006
You're not upset?

01:04:00.047 --> 01:04:01.924
Upset? I'll be the first one
to congratulate him,

01:04:01.924 --> 01:04:03.426
no matter how he finds a job.

01:04:03.467 --> 01:04:06.304
You're joking, right?
Listen up, monkeys,

01:04:06.345 --> 01:04:09.932
I need fresh meat to peddle, stat!
Process Engineer.

01:04:09.974 --> 01:04:13.060
Oh, he is very excited, Dane.

01:04:13.102 --> 01:04:15.897
It's an Engineering Manager spot.

01:04:15.939 --> 01:04:19.985
That's fantastic! Scratch that!
Engineering Manager!

01:04:20.027 --> 01:04:22.904
The drive's a little long, but doable.

01:04:22.946 --> 01:04:25.907
Gimme a drive-in, 423 area code!

01:04:25.949 --> 01:04:29.327
But Dane, it means
we wouldn't have to sell.

01:04:29.369 --> 01:04:32.707
I mean, we're just... we're just hoping.

01:04:32.749 --> 01:04:36.627
So am I. You're both
in my family's prayers.

01:04:36.669 --> 01:04:39.464
Bernadine...

01:04:39.505 --> 01:04:42.717
What company is he interviewing with?

01:04:42.759 --> 01:04:44.802
Now, I'm not a pushy man
by nature, Paul,

01:04:44.844 --> 01:04:47.597
ordinarily I don't get this excited

01:04:47.638 --> 01:04:49.307
about a candidate.
But when I told my guy

01:04:49.348 --> 01:04:51.225
that I was going to call you, he went...

01:04:51.267 --> 01:04:54.771
pardon my vulgarity...
ape shit./ I don't know.

01:04:54.812 --> 01:04:58.232
Degreed engineer, really
mature for such a young man...

01:04:58.274 --> 01:05:01.195
no wife, no kids, easy relo.

01:05:01.236 --> 01:05:04.615
But the best thing is, he knows exactly

01:05:04.656 --> 01:05:06.450
what you guys are trying to do
over there...

01:05:06.450 --> 01:05:08.327
and he wants to be a part of it.

01:05:08.368 --> 01:05:11.330
Now what time tomorrow morning
do you want him to be there?

01:05:11.371 --> 01:05:13.207
I think we might have found
the seasoning...

01:05:13.248 --> 01:05:14.291
we've been looking for.

01:05:14.333 --> 01:05:16.293
Seasoning's good.

01:05:16.335 --> 01:05:20.089
But some clichés are clichés for
a reason. Particularly the one

01:05:20.131 --> 01:05:22.759
about old dogs, new tricks.

01:05:25.011 --> 01:05:27.639
Eight AM sharp, Mr. Cobra.

01:05:42.737 --> 01:05:45.740
Dr. Singh?

01:05:50.371 --> 01:05:54.583
How are you, my friend?/ Tired.

01:05:54.625 --> 01:05:57.127
The T cells we treated

01:05:57.169 --> 01:06:00.089
are fighting the cancer in you.

01:06:02.007 --> 01:06:06.346
Dr. Singh? Your hat...

01:06:06.388 --> 01:06:09.391
Why do you wear it?

01:06:11.518 --> 01:06:14.813
I am a Sikh.

01:06:14.854 --> 01:06:18.400
My turban represents my constant
devotion to my religion.

01:06:20.528 --> 01:06:23.030
What do Sikhs believe?

01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:28.493
It's my experience

01:06:28.535 --> 01:06:32.289
that all religions are
some version of your, uh,

01:06:32.330 --> 01:06:34.791
'what goes around comes around.'

01:06:42.967 --> 01:06:46.387
We believe in the dignity
of everyone regardless

01:06:46.429 --> 01:06:50.725
of race, age, man, woman.

01:06:50.766 --> 01:06:53.687
A devout Sikh would protect

01:06:53.729 --> 01:06:56.690
with his own life the poor and the weak.

01:06:58.608 --> 01:07:01.862
Ryan...

01:07:01.903 --> 01:07:05.365
If I could take your sickness

01:07:05.407 --> 01:07:09.954
on myself and away from you,

01:07:09.996 --> 01:07:12.372
I would.

01:07:25.762 --> 01:07:27.722
Hey, buddy.

01:07:27.764 --> 01:07:30.183
Hey, Dad.

01:07:30.224 --> 01:07:32.894
Are you missing your party?

01:07:35.063 --> 01:07:38.107
Hey, honey, how you feeling?

01:07:38.149 --> 01:07:40.736
I'd like to go somewhere.

01:07:58.630 --> 01:08:02.716
There you go, Rhino,
the Wrigley Building.

01:08:02.758 --> 01:08:06.136
Man, that's a lotta Juicy Fruit.

01:08:06.178 --> 01:08:08.514
What do we know, Dad?

01:08:08.555 --> 01:08:11.976
Let's see what we got.

01:08:14.062 --> 01:08:16.981
It was modeled after
the Seville Cathedral's...

01:08:17.023 --> 01:08:19.109
Giralda Tower in Spain.

01:08:19.149 --> 01:08:22.403
Built in 1921.

01:08:22.444 --> 01:08:27.535
It has 250,000 terracotta tiles on it...

01:08:27.576 --> 01:08:30.955
that's why it's so white.

01:08:30.996 --> 01:08:36.210
That and the 116,000-watt
bulbs pointing at it.

01:08:36.252 --> 01:08:39.755
That clock? The hour hand

01:08:39.796 --> 01:08:43.760
is just over six feet long,
the minute hand nine feet.

01:08:43.801 --> 01:08:47.596
How do you know all that?

01:08:47.639 --> 01:08:51.600
There's a bank on the fourth floor.

01:08:51.642 --> 01:08:54.270
I was a teller there
for a little over a year...

01:08:54.310 --> 01:08:55.604
when I was seventeen.

01:08:55.645 --> 01:08:59.359
You worked in there?/ Mm-hmm.

01:08:59.401 --> 01:09:03.029
Awesome.

01:09:03.071 --> 01:09:05.573
Did I know that?

01:09:09.578 --> 01:09:13.124
It was like going to work in a castle.

01:09:13.165 --> 01:09:16.961
Only seventeen.

01:09:17.002 --> 01:09:21.799
And in such a hurry to be older.

01:09:21.841 --> 01:09:24.885
Get on with my life.

01:09:30.892 --> 01:09:33.812
I'm glad we came.

01:09:49.703 --> 01:09:52.331
♪ I can see your eyes ♪

01:09:52.372 --> 01:09:56.960
♪ Underneath these bright city lights ♪

01:09:57.002 --> 01:10:03.176
♪ Everything's all right
for a change... ♪

01:10:03.801 --> 01:10:06.596
Last call at the bar, ladies
and gentlemen. Last call.

01:10:17.191 --> 01:10:21.111
You clean up good./ It's the dress.

01:10:21.153 --> 01:10:25.032
Oh yeah, I see it now./ Asshole.

01:10:26.366 --> 01:10:28.117
How's Ryan?

01:10:31.204 --> 01:10:34.666
How long did Ed last?/ About an hour.

01:10:34.708 --> 01:10:36.710
Stretched it out, did he?

01:10:39.129 --> 01:10:42.424
You did an amazing job.
Situation reversed,

01:10:42.466 --> 01:10:45.844
sick child, I don't know.../
Doing an amazing job.

01:10:45.886 --> 01:10:49.682
Doing.

01:10:51.601 --> 01:10:54.270
You're solid, Wilson.

01:10:54.312 --> 01:10:58.858
You don't cut corners,
you do it the right way.

01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:01.653
Wow.

01:11:01.694 --> 01:11:05.407
You know, for all your macho BS,

01:11:05.449 --> 01:11:07.243
you're the first person
there every morning

01:11:07.284 --> 01:11:09.078
and the last one to go home.

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:10.913
You're on the phone
from the minute you get in,

01:11:10.913 --> 01:11:13.124
to the minute you leave.

01:11:13.165 --> 01:11:14.416
You're the biggest producer
at the company

01:11:14.416 --> 01:11:15.875
because you're the hardest worker,

01:11:15.917 --> 01:11:18.169
not 'cause any of that
Dixie Mafia nonsense.

01:11:21.882 --> 01:11:25.427
We're not that different, you and I.

01:11:27.346 --> 01:11:30.057
You're so full of shit./
We're very different.

01:11:30.099 --> 01:11:33.060
We're totally different./ Yeah.

01:11:33.102 --> 01:11:36.148
Anyway,

01:11:36.189 --> 01:11:41.111
the month's not over.
I may have a few tricks left.

01:11:43.029 --> 01:11:45.657
No. You don't.

01:11:45.699 --> 01:11:49.661
You're down $20,000 with
ten live interviews on the board.

01:11:49.703 --> 01:11:51.539
Five are wet because
your people are scared of you.

01:11:51.539 --> 01:11:53.332
They're phantoms. I checked.

01:11:53.374 --> 01:11:56.878
That leaves five remaining shots.
Of those, one pays a fee

01:11:56.919 --> 01:11:58.880
that would blow me out of
the water but it's a first interview

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:00.423
for a VP level position,

01:12:00.464 --> 01:12:02.550
which means it's rolling into next year.
Four shots left.

01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:05.093
Of those, three are interviewing
for the same job.

01:12:05.135 --> 01:12:07.722
Triple coverage, place one,
that's 15,000.

01:12:07.763 --> 01:12:09.140
Which leaves you
with one live interview,

01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:11.142
which, by the way, looks great.

01:12:11.183 --> 01:12:13.811
But the offer is contingent
upon a drug test.

01:12:13.853 --> 01:12:17.106
A drug test he can't pass.
How do I know?

01:12:17.148 --> 01:12:19.734
I heard him tell your guy
about his coke habit

01:12:19.775 --> 01:12:21.068
when I tapped into the call.

01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:24.615
You did what?

01:12:24.656 --> 01:12:27.951
You thought I was going
to rely on the honor system

01:12:27.993 --> 01:12:30.245
with a man who named himself
after a venomous snake

01:12:30.287 --> 01:12:32.873
and keeps a drawer
full of burner phones?

01:12:39.297 --> 01:12:42.800
Merry Christmas, Wilson.

01:12:42.842 --> 01:12:45.428
Go fuck yourself.

01:13:01.444 --> 01:13:05.323
Oh, Ryan, Daddy's here.

01:13:06.699 --> 01:13:09.787
Hey, Rhino.

01:13:09.828 --> 01:13:11.789
Hey...

01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:15.084
You're gonna be all right.

01:13:15.125 --> 01:13:17.878
I promise you.

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:20.214
You hear me?

01:13:20.255 --> 01:13:24.844
I... I got the Frank Lloyd Wright books.

01:13:24.886 --> 01:13:27.722
And we're gonna go and see
the Thomas Gale House,

01:13:27.764 --> 01:13:30.892
you and me.

01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:46.366
Hi.

01:15:00.402 --> 01:15:02.863
Ryan Jensen's room number, please.

01:15:02.905 --> 01:15:03.989
Are you family, sir?

01:15:04.031 --> 01:15:06.867
Absolutely.

01:15:10.871 --> 01:15:13.081
The ventilator will breathe
for Ryan until such time

01:15:13.123 --> 01:15:15.084
as you decide to stop it.

01:15:15.126 --> 01:15:17.836
Or until he breathes for himself, right?

01:15:17.878 --> 01:15:20.130
Until such time as
he breathes for himself?

01:15:20.172 --> 01:15:23.133
We need to discuss your wishes

01:15:23.175 --> 01:15:25.510
when Ryan codes again.

01:15:25.552 --> 01:15:29.848
When his heart stops./ Correct.

01:15:29.890 --> 01:15:33.227
What's to discuss?
It stops, you start it.

01:15:33.269 --> 01:15:36.940
Ryan is in a coma. He's tired.

01:15:36.981 --> 01:15:40.151
Okay, we got it, thanks.

01:15:54.083 --> 01:15:57.461
Mr. and Mrs. Jensen.
Few things

01:15:57.503 --> 01:16:00.964
are as comforting
for a child as the sound

01:16:01.006 --> 01:16:05.177
of a mother and father's voice.
Perhaps...

01:16:05.219 --> 01:16:08.889
Perhaps you can give Ryan
the chance to heal,

01:16:08.931 --> 01:16:13.060
let the treatment fight the leukemia...

01:16:13.102 --> 01:16:15.896
Please.

01:16:24.447 --> 01:16:28.159
Are you kidding me?
"Sound of a voice"?

01:16:28.201 --> 01:16:30.578
Stop it./ Surrounded by millions

01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:33.415
of dollars' worth
of technology and he says

01:16:33.456 --> 01:16:36.252
"sound of a voice"!/ I said, stop it!

01:16:39.422 --> 01:16:43.008
He's right.

01:16:43.050 --> 01:16:46.137
Kids need their parents, Dane.

01:16:46.178 --> 01:16:48.472
Not just when they're sick.

01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:55.729
Oh, I love Ryan every bit
as much as you do, Elise.

01:16:55.771 --> 01:16:59.150
I know you do.

01:16:59.191 --> 01:17:01.152
I just wish it didn't take him dying

01:17:01.193 --> 01:17:02.486
in order to get your attention.

01:17:02.528 --> 01:17:06.408
That's not fair.

01:17:06.450 --> 01:17:10.203
No, it's not fair.

01:17:10.245 --> 01:17:13.915
But my little boy is dying,

01:17:13.957 --> 01:17:17.878
so I'm not terribly concerned
about what's fair.

01:17:20.882 --> 01:17:23.176
I love you, Dane, but I'll be damned

01:17:23.217 --> 01:17:24.886
if I'm gonna let you keep him hooked up

01:17:24.927 --> 01:17:28.097
to some machine in order
to make up for lost time.

01:18:14.938 --> 01:18:18.066
I'm sorry about Ryan.

01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:23.948
I was with him when
he got his lumbar puncture.

01:18:23.989 --> 01:18:27.284
You know, his spinal tap?

01:18:35.208 --> 01:18:38.795
Anyway, I'm studying for my RN,

01:18:38.836 --> 01:18:43.300
so I try to expose myself
to as many procedures as I can.

01:18:43.342 --> 01:18:47.471
Plus, it helps the kids, right?
When they see a familiar face.

01:18:47.513 --> 01:18:50.349
I keep their mind off
the needle with questions...

01:18:50.391 --> 01:18:53.978
What's Dad do at work,

01:18:54.019 --> 01:18:57.774
what grade they're in,
sport they like to play,

01:18:57.816 --> 01:19:00.235
favorite food,

01:19:00.276 --> 01:19:02.821
just, you know...

01:19:02.862 --> 01:19:04.823
Stuff.

01:19:04.864 --> 01:19:07.575
I'm gonna ask you
another question, Ryan.

01:19:07.617 --> 01:19:10.203
What's your favorite place
in the world, buddy?

01:19:10.245 --> 01:19:12.331
Hmm? Come on, you're doing fine, Ryan.

01:19:12.373 --> 01:19:14.166
What's your favorite place?

01:19:14.208 --> 01:19:16.669
My house./ Your house?

01:19:16.711 --> 01:19:20.088
<i>There's a place on our step
which lets me know</i>

01:19:20.130 --> 01:19:22.173
<i>when Dad's coming up.</i>

01:19:23.967 --> 01:19:26.762
<i>He's the only one big enough
to make the noise.</i>

01:19:26.804 --> 01:19:29.682
<i>He works late a lot.</i>

01:19:29.724 --> 01:19:34.478
<i>But if I leave my light on,
he'll always come in.</i>

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:37.440
<i>I tell him it's because I like to draw,</i>

01:19:37.481 --> 01:19:40.025
<i>but I really just want to see him.</i>

01:19:40.067 --> 01:19:42.863
<i>When he leaves,</i>

01:19:42.904 --> 01:19:45.866
<i>I can still smell
his cologne for a while.</i>

01:19:45.907 --> 01:19:48.952
<i>It smells like Dad.</i>

01:19:48.994 --> 01:19:51.329
<i>It makes me feel...</i>

01:19:51.371 --> 01:19:53.749
<i>Safe.</i>

01:19:53.790 --> 01:19:57.627
Anyway, I just thought
you'd want to hear it.

01:19:59.630 --> 01:20:03.468
I think I would if my kid
someday thinks I'm a good dad.

01:20:03.509 --> 01:20:05.762
Like yours must.

01:20:11.266 --> 01:20:14.937
Antoine.

01:20:14.979 --> 01:20:18.941
My kid ever say what I did?

01:20:18.983 --> 01:20:21.903
For a living?

01:20:23.988 --> 01:20:26.741
Help other dads get jobs

01:20:26.782 --> 01:20:30.120
so they can take care of their families.

01:21:23.550 --> 01:21:26.553
The Thomas Gale House
is important, not only

01:21:26.595 --> 01:21:29.223
because it showcases the earlier
work of Frank Lloyd Wright,

01:21:29.265 --> 01:21:32.519
but it also hints at his
architectural potential.

01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:34.813
Now, Wright designed the home

01:21:34.854 --> 01:21:37.023
just before he left
the firm Adler and Sullivan.

01:21:37.065 --> 01:21:39.693
He didn't leave.

01:21:39.734 --> 01:21:43.238
Sullivan fired him.

01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:44.446
Because of this house.

01:21:44.488 --> 01:21:46.282
Excuse me, sir, can I help you?

01:21:46.323 --> 01:21:49.744
It's a "bootleg."

01:21:49.786 --> 01:21:53.873
Frank designed it
off the books for the Gale Family.

01:21:53.915 --> 01:21:57.127
See, before, Frank was all

01:21:57.168 --> 01:22:00.714
Prairie Style hard lines

01:22:00.755 --> 01:22:03.967
and cold concrete.

01:22:04.010 --> 01:22:07.096
He designed spaces
that let the light in.

01:22:07.138 --> 01:22:10.766
Rooms that opened up,
then wrapped around you.

01:22:10.808 --> 01:22:16.480
Made a family feel protected, safe.

01:22:16.522 --> 01:22:20.694
Like you belonged here
and only here. Home.

01:22:20.736 --> 01:22:24.197
But Frank was also a gambler,
a risk taker, and he knew

01:22:24.239 --> 01:22:26.199
that if he designed this
off the books for the Gale family,

01:22:26.199 --> 01:22:28.744
his boss might find out.

01:22:30.662 --> 01:22:33.748
Yeah, he knew what
goes around comes around.

01:22:35.667 --> 01:22:38.837
But he also knew that
he could create something

01:22:38.879 --> 01:22:41.757
that would live forever.

01:22:41.798 --> 01:22:44.384
Something magical.

01:22:47.888 --> 01:22:51.851
The magic that stirs men's blood.

01:23:03.613 --> 01:23:06.699
Wheeler residence./ Lou, Dane.

01:23:08.619 --> 01:23:11.914
About time you got off your ass
and went back to work, isn't it?

01:23:11.955 --> 01:23:14.124
Christmas is over, buddy.

01:23:14.166 --> 01:23:16.794
We got a week to get you a job
this year. Chop, chop.

01:23:16.835 --> 01:23:18.504
Think of him as a forty-year-old, Jimmy,

01:23:18.545 --> 01:23:21.130
we'll throw in the other
nineteen years free of charge!

01:23:21.172 --> 01:23:22.966
Hold that thought, Jimmy.

01:23:23.008 --> 01:23:26.678
Dane Jensen.
Hey, Toni, thanks for calling back,

01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:29.723
appreciate it.
Yes, Lou Wheeler.

01:23:29.765 --> 01:23:33.185
No, no, no! Don't you get it?
Every other company in the South

01:23:33.227 --> 01:23:35.854
is thinking first of the year!
You see him now,

01:23:35.896 --> 01:23:39.067
you take him off the market
before they get a crack at him!

01:23:39.108 --> 01:23:40.985
Now, what time Wednesday
works best for you?

01:23:41.027 --> 01:23:42.153
Morning or afternoon?

01:23:42.195 --> 01:23:45.782
Lou? Lou, calm down.

01:23:45.823 --> 01:23:48.743
Tell me, what are you saying
when they ask you,

01:23:48.785 --> 01:23:51.454
"Tell me a little bit about yourself?"

01:23:51.496 --> 01:23:53.665
No, Lou.

01:23:53.706 --> 01:23:57.378
Lou, no, Lou, Lou, stop!

01:23:57.419 --> 01:24:01.298
Christ, brother,
this isn't the biography channel.

01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:04.134
Even I wouldn't hire you.

01:24:04.176 --> 01:24:06.929
Alright.

01:24:06.971 --> 01:24:09.181
Okay. Say this.

01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:14.144
Miss Smith... Toni?

01:24:14.186 --> 01:24:18.774
You know, I've been working
a long time, you can see that.

01:24:18.816 --> 01:24:22.695
And all those years, I've seen
a lot of people come and go.

01:24:24.613 --> 01:24:28.743
I've seen people chasing what
they think will make them happy,

01:24:28.785 --> 01:24:32.580
money, titles, whatever.

01:24:32.622 --> 01:24:35.083
But it seems to me,

01:24:35.125 --> 01:24:37.377
if a man, or a woman,

01:24:37.419 --> 01:24:41.507
can be paid an honest wage
for an honest job,

01:24:41.549 --> 01:24:44.802
and if you can look back
at what you've done

01:24:44.844 --> 01:24:48.514
and feel proud,

01:24:48.556 --> 01:24:52.059
well then, you're happy.

01:24:53.978 --> 01:24:57.023
I know I'm running the risk of
sounding a little old fashioned,

01:24:57.064 --> 01:25:00.109
or naive even, but...

01:25:00.151 --> 01:25:03.946
I don't think you can
ever be too qualified

01:25:03.988 --> 01:25:07.366
to be happy. Do you?

01:25:07.408 --> 01:25:13.665
No, Lou, I don't.

01:25:13.707 --> 01:25:18.045
So. Tell me a little bit about yourself.

01:25:29.015 --> 01:25:32.643
Dane Jensen./ Dane, Toni. You know,

01:25:32.685 --> 01:25:34.520
I've never seen a tighter race
between two candidates.

01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:36.355
We'd like to make an offer.

01:25:39.067 --> 01:25:41.027
He'll take it.

01:25:41.069 --> 01:25:44.155
Whoa, pardner...
Shouldn't I tell you what it is first?

01:25:44.197 --> 01:25:47.742
Yeah, all right.

01:25:47.784 --> 01:25:50.870
Okay, what, what, what are you thinking?

01:25:50.912 --> 01:25:52.497
Well, we're kicking up the pay grade.

01:25:52.538 --> 01:25:54.957
One hundred grand base
salary, full relo,

01:25:54.999 --> 01:25:57.960
no sign-on bonus. Insurance
to start first day of employment.

01:25:58.002 --> 01:26:00.464
Now, it is New Year's Eve and
I plan to start drinking early.

01:26:00.464 --> 01:26:02.341
My math says your fee's 25,000.

01:26:02.382 --> 01:26:04.134
I need that expense
on this year's budget,

01:26:04.176 --> 01:26:07.262
so what do you say we wrap
this up right now. Is he in or out?

01:26:10.432 --> 01:26:14.102
On behalf of Mr. Wheeler, I accept.

01:26:14.144 --> 01:26:16.439
Mr. Wheeler?
No, no, Dane, look,

01:26:16.481 --> 01:26:19.108
we all loved Lou, but he came in second.

01:26:19.150 --> 01:26:20.401
I'm talking about your other guy.

01:26:20.401 --> 01:26:22.278
Other guy? What other guy?

01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:26.157
Ping. As in pong. You know,
the engineer with the doctorate.

01:26:26.199 --> 01:26:27.867
Ping?

01:26:27.909 --> 01:26:29.953
Ten minutes after I schedule
Lou for an interview,

01:26:29.994 --> 01:26:32.456
we get this resume from your
colleague at Blackridge.

01:26:32.498 --> 01:26:35.917
You don't forget a name
like "Race Bannon".

01:26:35.959 --> 01:26:39.087
Just, uh...

01:26:39.128 --> 01:26:43.007
Hang on one sec, Toni.

01:26:43.049 --> 01:26:45.009
Bannon?

01:26:45.051 --> 01:26:47.680
What?

01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:53.227
It doesn't really matter to me
which candidate you hire.

01:26:53.227 --> 01:26:55.020
Good 'cause we're hiring Ping.

01:26:55.062 --> 01:26:58.691
Bannon's my guy, so his deal's my deal.

01:26:58.732 --> 01:27:01.277
I win either way.

01:27:01.318 --> 01:27:03.446
I win.

01:27:03.488 --> 01:27:06.616
What else you got for Lou?

01:27:06.658 --> 01:27:08.743
Position wise? Nothing.

01:27:08.785 --> 01:27:12.330
Plain Jane Engineer, entry level,
temp to hire, anything?

01:27:12.372 --> 01:27:14.416
No, no, and no.

01:27:14.457 --> 01:27:18.044
Look, email me an invoice, Dane,
I gotta run. Happy New Year!

01:27:18.086 --> 01:27:19.839
Wait, who was the better candidate?

01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:21.340
What?

01:27:21.382 --> 01:27:23.883
Who was the best candidate?

01:27:25.802 --> 01:27:28.888
Are you recording this?

01:27:31.891 --> 01:27:35.605
Okay. Fact is,
Lou's the better candidate.

01:27:35.646 --> 01:27:38.107
Now, I can't ask him his age,
but come on...

01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:40.610
<i>How many years does he have
before he calls it a day?</i>

01:27:40.651 --> 01:27:42.278
<i>He's just...</i>

01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:46.240
He's not a good investment.
Between realtor fees,

01:27:46.282 --> 01:27:49.577
closing costs, storage,
relo's gonna run us $40,000,

01:27:49.618 --> 01:27:52.205
temporary living another ten,
and then there's your fee?

01:27:54.499 --> 01:27:57.419
Hire Lou,

01:27:57.461 --> 01:27:59.546
and he's on the house.

01:28:01.465 --> 01:28:03.550
I didn't hear you right.
Say that again?

01:28:03.592 --> 01:28:05.927
You heard right.

01:28:05.970 --> 01:28:09.974
Hire Bannon's guy you pay 25 grand.
Hire Lou? No charge.

01:28:10.016 --> 01:28:12.142
What?

01:28:12.184 --> 01:28:16.772
Why in the world would you
wanna give away 25,000.

01:28:16.813 --> 01:28:19.941
Because he's a good man.

01:28:19.983 --> 01:28:23.821
He has experience no degree can match.

01:28:23.863 --> 01:28:27.200
He's made all the mistakes a guy
half his age hasn't made yet,

01:28:27.241 --> 01:28:30.953
but will, and he's learned
from them all.

01:28:30.995 --> 01:28:35.249
Because he won't lie or pretend
to be something he's not.

01:28:40.464 --> 01:28:44.468
Because everything I need,
I already have.

01:28:44.510 --> 01:28:48.430
And because the price is right, Toni.

01:28:48.472 --> 01:28:53.102
It's a one-time offer,
expires in ten seconds.

01:28:53.143 --> 01:28:55.355
In or out?

01:28:58.316 --> 01:29:01.401
Who was that?

01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:05.405
Lou, what's wrong?

01:29:10.078 --> 01:29:12.622
What would you think
about seeing the grandkids?

01:29:14.541 --> 01:29:16.918
I thought we were gonna wait
until money wasn't so tight.

01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:19.712
I don't mean visiting them,
I mean seeing them.

01:29:19.754 --> 01:29:21.798
Every day, if you want to.

01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:25.010
That was Miss Smith from LOK.

01:29:25.052 --> 01:29:27.555
They're based out in Gainesville.

01:29:27.596 --> 01:29:32.059
That's about, what?
Half an hour away from the kids?

01:29:32.101 --> 01:29:34.812
I'm their new Engineering Manager.

01:29:36.856 --> 01:29:39.233
Gosh!

01:29:39.275 --> 01:29:42.362
Louis William Wheeler,

01:29:42.404 --> 01:29:46.867
I am so proud of you.
Oh gosh, honey.

01:29:46.908 --> 01:29:50.786
Come on now, come on...

01:29:50.828 --> 01:29:53.914
We both knew it was only
a matter of time.

01:29:56.334 --> 01:30:00.839
Well, I have so much packing
to do, and a realtor and...

01:30:00.881 --> 01:30:03.258
Can I call the kids and tell them?

01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:07.137
Yeah! I'm gonna take a shower./ Okay.

01:31:22.549 --> 01:31:25.301
Well, Rhino...

01:31:25.343 --> 01:31:28.304
We did it.

01:31:39.566 --> 01:31:42.736
I don't know what I thought.

01:31:42.778 --> 01:31:46.031
Maybe if I did a good thing,

01:31:46.073 --> 01:31:49.786
something totally out of character,

01:31:49.828 --> 01:31:53.540
that it would make a difference.

01:31:53.581 --> 01:31:58.795
And it did, I guess,

01:31:58.837 --> 01:32:01.423
to a man I've never seen.

01:32:01.464 --> 01:32:04.343
Probably never talk to again.

01:32:07.012 --> 01:32:09.056
But I did something today

01:32:09.098 --> 01:32:12.726
that you'd be proud of.

01:32:12.768 --> 01:32:16.062
I mean, I think you'd be proud of me.

01:32:19.150 --> 01:32:21.986
Just like I'm proud of you.

01:32:22.027 --> 01:32:26.365
Something I should have
told you every day...

01:32:26.407 --> 01:32:28.367
I'm proud

01:32:28.409 --> 01:32:31.620
of my little man.

01:32:33.540 --> 01:32:37.002
And if you're tired of fighting,

01:32:37.043 --> 01:32:40.881
and... and you need to rest,

01:32:40.922 --> 01:32:44.843
well, then I understand.

01:32:46.761 --> 01:32:49.432
I'll even keep Lauren out of your room.

01:32:52.685 --> 01:32:55.855
Me and your mom...

01:32:55.897 --> 01:32:58.649
we'll be okay...

01:32:58.691 --> 01:33:02.402
We'll be okay.

01:33:22.132 --> 01:33:24.509
Hey, hon.

01:33:24.551 --> 01:33:27.346
How's he doing?

01:33:29.264 --> 01:33:32.017
The same.

01:33:35.479 --> 01:33:37.982
You need to get some rest.

01:33:38.024 --> 01:33:41.110
Let me sit with him for a while.

01:33:41.152 --> 01:33:45.365
My mom's got the kids.
Go home, take a nap.

01:33:45.406 --> 01:33:48.159
Maybe a shower?

01:33:48.201 --> 01:33:51.203
Please?

01:33:54.082 --> 01:33:56.501
I can't.

01:33:56.542 --> 01:33:58.711
I don't wanna be gone if he...

01:33:58.753 --> 01:34:02.465
Dane, if he codes,

01:34:02.507 --> 01:34:06.010
and only if he codes, I'll call you.

01:34:08.097 --> 01:34:11.433
I'm not gonna let him go without you.

01:34:50.932 --> 01:34:54.477
Dane?

01:34:54.519 --> 01:34:56.439
I love you.

01:34:56.480 --> 01:35:00.025
What's not to love?

01:36:36.125 --> 01:36:38.211
You're fired.

01:36:40.129 --> 01:36:42.757
What?

01:36:42.799 --> 01:36:45.886
You can't just fire me.

01:36:45.928 --> 01:36:50.140
My place. I'll fire anybody I want.

01:36:50.182 --> 01:36:54.561
No, I don't mean...
I don't mean you "can't," Ed, I mean...

01:36:54.603 --> 01:36:56.730
Pack up your shit and beat it.

01:37:00.401 --> 01:37:03.780
Fired? Why?

01:37:03.822 --> 01:37:08.492
Because I gave away one guy?
Ed, I've billed out millions...

01:37:08.534 --> 01:37:10.536
Wilson won.
She doesn't need you

01:37:10.577 --> 01:37:12.037
second-guessing her.

01:37:12.079 --> 01:37:13.747
And besides, you're not
the same guy anymore.

01:37:13.747 --> 01:37:17.252
I... I am the same guy, Ed.../
No, you are not!

01:37:17.293 --> 01:37:20.672
I don't want to hear it anymore.

01:37:22.757 --> 01:37:26.553
Over. Done. Get out.

01:37:48.410 --> 01:37:50.871
You know, I used to say
a relationship with you

01:37:50.912 --> 01:37:54.415
was based only on the ability
to make you money.

01:37:56.333 --> 01:37:58.711
It just sounded tough.

01:37:58.752 --> 01:38:01.589
I never really believed it.

01:38:01.630 --> 01:38:05.385
Shut the door, please.

01:38:38.545 --> 01:38:43.299
No, no, no, no, no, no...

01:39:26.136 --> 01:39:27.846
Oh, honey!

01:39:27.888 --> 01:39:32.600
Dad?

01:39:41.986 --> 01:39:45.155
Rhi... Rhino!

01:39:45.197 --> 01:39:48.742
How you doing?/ Fine.

01:39:56.167 --> 01:39:59.045
Hey./ It's gonna be okay.

01:40:00.964 --> 01:40:03.049
It's gonna be okay.

01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:17.440
Come here.

01:40:36.375 --> 01:40:39.420
How's he doing?

01:40:39.462 --> 01:40:42.758
His counts are still coming up.

01:40:42.799 --> 01:40:45.927
He's good.

01:40:45.969 --> 01:40:50.056
Uh, a messenger brought this
to the house. From Blackridge.

01:40:59.942 --> 01:41:02.737
Here's the thing, Elise.

01:41:02.779 --> 01:41:05.948
I didn't take today,

01:41:05.990 --> 01:41:10.368
or yesterday, or the week off.

01:41:10.410 --> 01:41:13.289
I lost my job.

01:41:13.331 --> 01:41:15.374
Ed fired me.

01:41:15.416 --> 01:41:18.419
Oh.

01:41:19.879 --> 01:41:22.590
Thank God!

01:41:46.032 --> 01:41:50.036
What is this?

01:41:55.874 --> 01:41:58.460
Son of a bitch.

01:42:33.540 --> 01:42:37.544
Daddy!/ Jesus, Lauren...!

01:42:37.585 --> 01:42:39.129
Watcha doin'?

01:42:39.170 --> 01:42:41.840
I'm working.
What does it look like I'm doing?

01:42:41.881 --> 01:42:43.924
Doesn't look like you're doing anything.

01:42:43.966 --> 01:42:45.801
I'm making it look easy.

01:42:48.179 --> 01:42:50.765
What?/ Can we sit in your spinny?

01:42:50.807 --> 01:42:53.310
No, you can't sit in my spinny chair.

01:42:53.351 --> 01:42:56.187
Please?

01:42:56.229 --> 01:42:59.190
Okay, come on.

01:43:02.652 --> 01:43:05.281
Getting in?/ I'm too old for that.

01:43:05.322 --> 01:43:09.076
Come on!

01:43:09.118 --> 01:43:13.122
Okay! Scooch over!/ Alright, here we go!

01:43:13.164 --> 01:43:17.501
No!

01:43:17.543 --> 01:43:19.755
Kids, come on, leave your dad alone.

01:43:19.796 --> 01:43:21.423
You gotta get on the bus
in half an hour.

01:43:21.423 --> 01:43:24.843
Come on. Lauren, that hair...

01:43:24.885 --> 01:43:28.096
Do you want the door open or shut?

01:43:28.138 --> 01:43:30.265
Will someone wipe me when I'm done?

01:43:30.307 --> 01:43:31.349
Shut.

01:43:58.795 --> 01:44:01.589
Jensen Group Recruiting, Dane Jensen.

01:44:01.631 --> 01:44:03.132
It's about time you got off your ass...

01:44:03.132 --> 01:44:04.801
and went back to work, isn't it?

01:44:04.842 --> 01:44:06.887
Lou, how you doin'?!

01:44:06.929 --> 01:44:09.598
Oh man, I'm busier than a one-legged man

01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:11.809
in an ass-kicking contest...
and I'm loving it!

01:44:13.477 --> 01:44:16.814
And how about you?
Can't be easy starting over again.

01:44:16.855 --> 01:44:20.191
Oh, I'm... I'm pretty busy.

01:44:20.233 --> 01:44:22.736
Could you be busier?/ Come again?

01:44:22.778 --> 01:44:24.404
Now that I've got
my feet on the ground...

01:44:24.404 --> 01:44:26.782
I've got the go-ahead
to hire some new engineers.

01:44:26.824 --> 01:44:30.619
Engineers?

01:44:30.661 --> 01:44:32.621
Plural?

01:44:32.663 --> 01:44:35.249
Yeah, we're gonna need two
at least to start, maybe three.

01:44:35.290 --> 01:44:38.002
We're flexible on salary.

01:44:38.044 --> 01:44:39.504
And I wouldn't want to talk
to anybody but you, Dane.

01:44:39.504 --> 01:44:41.548
And I never will.

01:44:41.589 --> 01:44:45.301
I appreciate that, Lou. I do.

01:44:45.343 --> 01:44:49.013
And I'm thinking of one name,

01:44:49.055 --> 01:44:52.892
three words, Mohammed Al Farooq.

01:44:52.934 --> 01:44:56.730
Oh, boy./ Hey, Lou...

01:44:56.772 --> 01:44:59.358
You mind if I call you back
in about an hour?

01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:02.069
I've got a daily meeting I can't miss.

01:45:02.111 --> 01:45:03.487
Walnuts?

01:45:03.529 --> 01:45:05.281
Oz says they're his food of choice.

01:45:05.322 --> 01:45:07.616
If you're ever stranded on
a deserted island... walnuts.

01:45:07.616 --> 01:45:11.370
Guess he didn't plan
on being stranded with you.

01:45:17.543 --> 01:45:20.170
You save the receipt for this?

01:45:20.212 --> 01:45:21.630
I think it's here somewhere, why?

01:45:21.672 --> 01:45:23.007
Alright, yeah.

01:45:23.048 --> 01:45:26.011
Tax write-off... business lunch.

01:45:29.139 --> 01:45:32.517
Dane Jensen... husband, father,

01:45:32.559 --> 01:45:34.519
last of the romantics.
