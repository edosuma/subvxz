WEBVTT

00:05.339 --> 00:08.008
If you had just taken apá
to his transfusion, Johnny.

00:08.042 --> 00:09.176
I have to call the family.

00:09.210 --> 00:10.678
They're gonna want to know
the funeral arrangements.

00:10.711 --> 00:12.446
You know he didn't make no arrangements.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.715
Yeah, I know.
So we're gonna have to figure it out.

00:14.749 --> 00:17.618
Emma, I think we should try
and meet this guy

00:17.651 --> 00:19.487
to make sure he's not our father.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.189
Seriously, Lyn? None of this is real.

00:22.223 --> 00:23.624
But what if it is?

00:23.657 --> 00:25.559
Nico hasn't been completely honest
with you.

00:25.593 --> 00:27.061
We're still married.

00:27.094 --> 00:30.464
It was a nice few days,
but it won't happen again.

00:30.498 --> 00:32.133
Yeah?

00:32.166 --> 00:33.300
I hope it did the trick for you.

00:34.135 --> 00:36.170
- Hey, back off, man.
- You gonna make me?

01:45.739 --> 01:47.842
I never thought I'd see you again.

01:51.545 --> 01:53.314
Why are you so fucking hot?

01:59.854 --> 02:02.289
- Who's this?
- My girlfriend.

02:37.224 --> 02:38.893
Shit. It's too early.

02:38.926 --> 02:40.928
I should go.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.864
I learned that Emma's
not a "stay the night" type.

02:56.744 --> 02:59.613
So did you two get into a fight?

03:00.514 --> 03:02.483
Am I your fix-it for the night?

03:02.516 --> 03:06.387
You think because we're a couple
and we want a third, we need a reason?

03:06.420 --> 03:07.855
That's not how we work.

03:07.888 --> 03:12.860
Look, I'm not anti this, obviously.

03:12.893 --> 03:17.898
I just think
that sometimes these equations

03:17.932 --> 03:20.267
suffer from a missing variable.

03:20.301 --> 03:22.937
- Oh, we're doing math now?
- Well, statistics.

03:27.274 --> 03:31.512
Tonight we decided we wanted you,
and so here you are.

03:31.545 --> 03:35.716
Right, tonight I'm the variable.

03:39.587 --> 03:43.390
What happens when the equation
stops working for you?

03:43.824 --> 03:45.859
What kind of question is that to ask?

03:45.893 --> 03:47.294
I'm not worried.

03:47.795 --> 03:49.530
Well, that's brave.

03:49.563 --> 03:52.266
She's saying it 'cause she doesn't think
we're gonna work out.

03:52.299 --> 03:54.401
Well, not you specifically.

03:54.435 --> 03:55.469
I just...

03:55.970 --> 03:57.771
...don't ever think

03:57.805 --> 04:01.909
these things work out with anyone.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.477
No matter the equation,

04:03.510 --> 04:07.381
someone always betrays,

04:07.414 --> 04:08.482
lies...

04:09.883 --> 04:12.686
...doesn't hold up
their end of the bargain.

04:15.623 --> 04:17.291
It's human.

04:17.324 --> 04:20.561
Shit. What the hell happened to you?

04:22.396 --> 04:23.897
Maybe I will take a hit.

04:34.575 --> 04:37.044
Lord, why did I sign up
for this self-flagellation?

04:37.277 --> 04:40.481
Just a little bit longer
on this one, and then we switch.

04:40.514 --> 04:41.849
Bitch.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.854
Oh, hey, did you hear back from UCLA?

04:47.855 --> 04:48.856
No.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.825
I don't know
if I was aiming too high or what.

04:51.859 --> 04:52.860
What? Why?

04:52.893 --> 04:57.331
Like, if I should applied to teach
at a community college first.

04:58.365 --> 05:01.802
I just thought, once I got my PhD,
everything would line up.

05:01.835 --> 05:05.673
You know that vision board in my head
where I spend all week teaching,

05:05.706 --> 05:08.442
but Sundays I cook caldo
for me and Memo...

05:08.475 --> 05:10.010
that's gonna be my husband's name...

05:10.044 --> 05:11.712
and for our twin changuitos.

05:11.745 --> 05:14.581
When am I gonna meet this Memo guy?

05:14.615 --> 05:16.316
Yeah, girl, who you telling?

05:16.350 --> 05:17.718
All right, switch!

05:18.952 --> 05:19.953
Come on.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.422
Don't think I didn't see you stop.

05:22.623 --> 05:25.025
I'm gonna be 30,
and I'm still so undercooked.

05:25.659 --> 05:28.395
Oh, my God, that's right.
It's gonna be your birthday.

05:30.030 --> 05:32.866
Wait, we should throw
a big birthday blowout for you.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.802
We can totally do it at the bar.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.438
Look at these lonjas.
Does it look like I'm blowout presentable?

05:37.471 --> 05:38.706
Oh, my God.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.874
But another mimosa day, sí, te lo acepto.

05:43.410 --> 05:45.012
Is it cheat day already?

05:45.045 --> 05:48.415
You don't get a cheat day when you've only
been working out for one day.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.584
Yeah, says you.

05:51.952 --> 05:54.354
Let's go day-drink our worries away again.

05:54.388 --> 05:55.422
I can't.

05:56.590 --> 05:57.591
I...

05:58.459 --> 06:02.563
...have some stuff to do
before Mariachi Karaoke.

06:02.596 --> 06:03.697
You're coming tonight, right?

06:03.731 --> 06:05.065
Yeah, pero por supuesto.

06:05.099 --> 06:06.133
But what stuff?

06:06.934 --> 06:09.770
I am going to go see...

06:10.838 --> 06:12.773
...my father guy.

06:15.109 --> 06:17.377
And is Miss Emma gonna go with you?

06:17.411 --> 06:20.080
No, she's not, so don't say a word.

06:20.114 --> 06:21.548
You hear me?

06:22.950 --> 06:24.885
I just have to see him for myself first.

06:24.918 --> 06:27.588
Then I can make a rational
and informed decision.

06:28.122 --> 06:29.690
He's either gonna be Coach Taylor

06:29.723 --> 06:32.126
or that Lannister guy
that died on the toilet.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.462
But I won't know till I know, you know?

06:35.496 --> 06:36.930
Yeah, but Emma's all-knowing.

06:36.964 --> 06:39.800
I know, which is why you can't crack.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.802
Not a peep tonight at karaoke.

06:42.469 --> 06:43.804
Pico cerrado.

06:43.837 --> 06:47.608
I'll just steer clear so she doesn't give
me that Medusa look she gives.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.510
- Turns me to stone.
- Stop.

06:49.977 --> 06:51.779
She's actually being really nice.

06:51.812 --> 06:54.481
We're getting along again,
and I don't want to fuck with it.

06:54.515 --> 06:55.983
Why do you keep stopping?

06:56.617 --> 06:59.553
Come on! Lose those lonjas!

06:59.586 --> 07:01.155
Respect my boundaries.

07:01.188 --> 07:02.656
Me vas a dar dysmorphia.

07:10.164 --> 07:11.632
Good morning.

07:12.166 --> 07:15.502
Or afternoon now.

07:16.170 --> 07:17.638
Hey.

07:25.045 --> 07:27.781
Oh. I grabbed my stuff.

07:28.882 --> 07:29.883
Here's your key.

07:34.688 --> 07:37.858
Nico, if you need a place
to stay for a bit,

07:37.891 --> 07:41.195
- I'm sure we can work...
- No, I'm good. I have a place.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.696
Thanks.

07:46.800 --> 07:47.801
Great.

07:51.004 --> 07:54.007
So the stock is kind of low

07:54.041 --> 07:57.010
on the citrus and garnish, too.

07:57.044 --> 07:59.713
So I think I need to make a run.

08:00.214 --> 08:02.716
Great, just keep the receipts.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.552
Of course.

08:18.232 --> 08:19.566
Are you drinking?

08:25.005 --> 08:26.273
Are you okay to drive?

08:28.275 --> 08:29.276
Nico.

08:40.053 --> 08:43.790
I can get rid of her, you know, like that.

08:45.959 --> 08:49.129
I'm like the Inspector Gadget
of spotting a fuckboy,

08:49.162 --> 08:53.100
and that is a fuckboy
that just walked out right there.

08:54.801 --> 08:57.738
Em, I'm sorry you broke up.
I really liked Nico.

08:57.771 --> 09:00.574
We didn't break up,
because we were never together.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.310
Oh, wait, Em.

09:03.543 --> 09:07.915
So I was thinking
we could add a little more color in here.

09:07.948 --> 09:11.952
So I'm going to replace
those black-and-white pictures with these.

09:17.958 --> 09:21.828
They're so gay.

09:21.862 --> 09:22.963
In your honor.

09:23.931 --> 09:26.800
And also so on-theme for us, right?

09:29.970 --> 09:31.605
- Yeah.
- Great.

09:31.638 --> 09:34.675
Oh, about tonight,

09:34.708 --> 09:37.311
I still don't understand
how it's gonna work

09:37.344 --> 09:40.013
with karaoke and a live mariachi band.

09:40.047 --> 09:42.182
Oh, oh, not just any mariachi.

09:42.215 --> 09:45.619
It's an all-female mariachi.

09:46.653 --> 09:48.922
See? Again, so on-theme.

09:48.956 --> 09:50.290
Don't worry, I will be here,

09:50.324 --> 09:52.192
and I will get up there
and explain everything.

09:52.225 --> 09:53.226
Great.

10:50.884 --> 10:54.254
Hermana, sí, gracias por venir.
Y ahí nos vemos.

10:54.287 --> 10:58.692
- Claro que sí, pastor. Sí.
- Hermano, ya lo extrañábamos.

10:58.725 --> 11:00.227
- Gracias.
- Que sí.

11:01.061 --> 11:05.065
Bueno, pues ahí los espero
y que Dios los bendiga.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.071
¿Hermana?

11:13.240 --> 11:14.908
¿En qué le puedo ayudar?

11:21.748 --> 11:23.316
Could I help you with something?

11:29.389 --> 11:30.424
Yeah.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.061
Sorry.

11:34.094 --> 11:36.897
This purse is full of so much stuff.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.115
This is...

11:56.917 --> 11:59.252
...me, Lynda.

12:01.321 --> 12:03.256
This is my sister, Emma.

12:12.032 --> 12:13.934
Do you know who I am?

12:22.776 --> 12:24.444
And these, too.

12:30.317 --> 12:31.485
Damn.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.983
No, no. Don't hurt him, please!

13:03.016 --> 13:06.353
Sir, I'm going to have to
if you are refusing to open this door.

13:07.187 --> 13:08.188
All right, last chance.

13:08.221 --> 13:10.790
Come on, buddy,
you don't want it to get ugly.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.026
No!

13:13.994 --> 13:15.195
- Okay, let's go.
- No, papi.

13:17.430 --> 13:18.431
Hold him.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.333
- Andrés, no digas nada.
- Get back, get back!

13:20.367 --> 13:21.468
No digas nada, mi amor.

13:21.501 --> 13:23.503
No te preocupes, mi'ja.

13:25.372 --> 13:26.840
You two on the other side.

13:26.873 --> 13:29.242
Señora, did they ask you for a warrant?

13:29.276 --> 13:30.477
Le enseñaron paperwork?

13:30.510 --> 13:31.845
They just came and... Look at that.

13:31.878 --> 13:34.014
They broke his window and yanked him out.

13:34.047 --> 13:37.083
Hey, hey! No, you're violating
this man's right to due process!

13:37.117 --> 13:40.020
Little lesson for you,
non-citizens don't get due process.

13:40.053 --> 13:44.024
That's a fucking lie! The Constitution
protects everyone's rights to due process!

13:44.057 --> 13:45.592
- Did you hear this motherfucker?
- Stay back!

13:45.825 --> 13:47.894
ICE is out here in these streets,
acting illegally,

13:47.928 --> 13:50.030
picking people up without warrants.

13:50.063 --> 13:52.065
This man has rights,
and you're violating them.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.869
Yo, are you serious, dude?
You're fucking gente.

13:55.902 --> 13:58.104
You're one of us, and this is
what you're doing with your life,

13:58.138 --> 13:59.539
rounding fucking people up?

13:59.573 --> 14:00.974
You fucking arrepentido!

14:01.908 --> 14:04.578
Man, I'm putting all of you on blast,
fucking self-hating Mexican.

14:04.611 --> 14:05.612
Papi.

14:05.845 --> 14:06.947
Fucking cabrones.

14:07.881 --> 14:09.583
You fucking race traitor!

14:13.086 --> 14:14.254
Fuck!

14:14.287 --> 14:15.922
I didn't know, baby.

14:16.923 --> 14:19.259
Todo va a salir bien, mi amor.

14:19.292 --> 14:22.862
Óyeme. No te preocupes de nada.
Todo va a salir bien.

14:35.609 --> 14:38.278
I should have tried harder
to try to see you.

14:38.311 --> 14:42.282
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have let Vidalia
scare me away so easily.

14:43.950 --> 14:45.118
She scared you away?

14:45.151 --> 14:46.453
Yes, but...

14:52.092 --> 14:54.628
Lynda, mereces la verdad.

14:56.263 --> 14:59.466
I didn't always walk
this path of righteousness.

15:02.369 --> 15:06.139
I was a bad man.
That's the only way to say it.

15:07.274 --> 15:09.943
I wasn't a good husband to your mother.

15:09.976 --> 15:12.479
I wasn't a good father to you girls.

15:16.149 --> 15:18.451
Vidalia told me to stay away.

15:20.253 --> 15:23.089
And I thought
that maybe she knew better than me.

15:23.123 --> 15:25.125
It was probably for the best.

15:27.961 --> 15:31.331
But I know now that it is never God's will

15:31.364 --> 15:34.167
to have a father separated
from his children.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.504
Now that I'm delivered, I can see that.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.508
I mean...

15:45.011 --> 15:46.546
...we turned out fine.

15:46.579 --> 15:49.549
Sin duda. Sin duda.

16:05.065 --> 16:09.035
It's really hard to get Emma
to want to take a picture with me.

16:10.370 --> 16:11.671
Qué bellas.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.209
After mami died...

16:18.211 --> 16:20.146
...she left us the bar.

16:23.616 --> 16:25.652
And we took it over.

16:27.053 --> 16:28.555
It's been good.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.324
- Qué bueno.
- Yeah.

16:31.358 --> 16:32.692
Mostly because of Emma.

16:32.726 --> 16:36.096
She's such a good businesswoman.

16:36.129 --> 16:40.333
Mi'ja, I'm pretty sure you had
something to do with it, too.

16:41.401 --> 16:42.569
I might have.

16:45.538 --> 16:47.107
Where did you get that?

16:48.108 --> 16:49.476
She threw it out.

16:49.509 --> 16:52.078
What, my W locket?

16:52.112 --> 16:53.747
I found it with don Fully's things.

16:53.780 --> 16:56.316
No, mi'ja, that's not a W.

16:56.349 --> 17:00.687
It's two Vs for Victor y Vida.

17:03.223 --> 17:04.791
Oh, my God.

17:05.024 --> 17:08.595
I gave that to your mami a long time ago.

17:10.597 --> 17:14.601
I wish our story had ended differently
even if we didn't stay together.

17:16.169 --> 17:20.240
Pero las cosas por algo pasan.

17:20.273 --> 17:23.510
If she hadn't gotten me deported,
I wouldn't be here today.

17:23.543 --> 17:26.613
Wait. She had you deported?

17:26.646 --> 17:31.084
She didn't know that Immigration
was going to be involved.

17:31.117 --> 17:33.153
She only thought
she was calling the police.

17:33.186 --> 17:34.587
Why was she calling the police?

17:34.621 --> 17:36.689
Me porté mal, mi'ja.

17:37.457 --> 17:40.226
I had misbehaved. I get it now.

17:40.260 --> 17:44.230
But still, she had to have known
that something like that could happen,

17:44.264 --> 17:45.799
like, with your status.

17:45.832 --> 17:48.802
Mi'ja, ¿sabes qué? Ya no importa.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.672
Ya lo pasado, pasado.

17:52.705 --> 17:56.576
I spent a long time
talking to God about it,

17:56.609 --> 18:01.614
and I finally stopped
blaming myself or Vidalia.

18:03.349 --> 18:04.484
I forgive her.

18:06.319 --> 18:07.654
You know what?

18:12.625 --> 18:13.827
I don't.

18:23.136 --> 18:24.270
Excuse me.

18:32.178 --> 18:33.179
Nico.

18:34.514 --> 18:36.249
Hey, Eddy.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.186
What's up, man?

18:46.192 --> 18:47.527
Hey, what's the matter, dude?

18:51.364 --> 18:52.832
Eddy, you want to sit down?

18:53.700 --> 18:55.134
Have a drink?

18:55.168 --> 18:56.402
I'm sorry.

18:57.203 --> 18:58.338
Could I just...

18:58.371 --> 18:59.873
No, do you need to eat something?

18:59.906 --> 19:02.876
I think we have some nuts, right, Emma?

19:02.909 --> 19:03.910
Yeah.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.448
I'll get you some nuts.

19:18.391 --> 19:19.559
Gracias.

19:27.233 --> 19:28.535
You were right.

19:30.403 --> 19:31.571
He's alive.

19:33.406 --> 19:34.407
Who's alive?

19:35.275 --> 19:38.711
Victor, Vidalia's husband.

19:52.358 --> 19:53.760
You saw him?

19:53.793 --> 19:57.397
No, and I don't want to.

20:11.477 --> 20:13.346
Stay as long as you want.

20:13.379 --> 20:14.380
Okay?

20:44.711 --> 20:45.712
Hi.

20:46.479 --> 20:48.815
Can I get dos cups, please?

20:49.983 --> 20:52.986
And one with no jicama, por favor.

20:54.787 --> 20:56.522
So we're getting free supplies
donated from Casa,

20:56.556 --> 20:57.724
so we should thank them on the Gram...

20:57.757 --> 20:59.993
Yo, I just fucking witnessed
the most fucking fucked-up shit,

21:00.026 --> 21:01.828
like, right here, like,
fucking eight blocks away.

21:01.861 --> 21:04.697
And all I had to do was stand there
with the fucking wife.

21:04.731 --> 21:05.965
I didn't even know
what the fuck to say to her.

21:05.999 --> 21:07.967
- What happened?
- Look at this shit.

21:08.001 --> 21:10.536
They fucking detained this dude,
all fucking Nazi-force,

21:10.570 --> 21:12.005
dragged him out of his fucking car,

21:12.038 --> 21:13.973
and took him away
in front of his fucking kid.

21:14.007 --> 21:16.809
They just came and... Look at that.
They broke his window, and yanked him out.

21:16.843 --> 21:19.412
Hey, no, you're violating
this man's right to due process.

21:19.445 --> 21:21.014
Non-citizens don't get due process.

21:21.047 --> 21:22.949
- And this happened just now?
- Yeah, right here.

21:22.982 --> 21:24.317
And I couldn't even do shit!

21:24.350 --> 21:26.319
He's probably at the detention center
in Alameda by now.

21:26.352 --> 21:27.854
We need to show up there
right now and do a paro.

21:27.887 --> 21:29.756
Hold up.
Hey, we're not going anywhere right now.

21:29.789 --> 21:30.790
- What?
- This is something

21:30.823 --> 21:31.891
that needs to be discussed.

21:31.924 --> 21:33.926
- Why not? We could do something.
- Yeah.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.062
First of all, you shouldn't risk it.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.630
Dude, I've done plenty of protests.

21:37.664 --> 21:39.565
Don't make me
your DACA poster child, Mikey.

21:39.599 --> 21:42.001
Okay, we should discuss
the different actions that we could take.

21:42.035 --> 21:44.470
We could stop traffic on the freeway,
put his name on a banner,

21:44.504 --> 21:45.905
put it over the Broadway overpass.

21:45.938 --> 21:47.640
We could get cameras on us tonight.

21:47.674 --> 21:48.941
There's a GoFundMe page option.

21:48.975 --> 21:51.044
- GoFundMe doesn't do shit.
- For posting his bond, Mari.

21:51.077 --> 21:53.646
- Hey, what if we do a hunger strike?
- A fucking hunger strike?

21:53.680 --> 21:55.515
For the future, we got to point

21:55.548 --> 21:57.483
the Spanish-speaking gente
to the Know Your Rights workshops.

21:57.517 --> 21:59.085
We need to do something right now!

21:59.318 --> 22:01.487
- We need to vote, okay?
- Vote? What?

22:01.521 --> 22:03.723
- This is a collective, Mari.
- Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up.

22:03.756 --> 22:06.492
Are we voting on a particular action here?
Are we voting to keep discussing action?

22:06.526 --> 22:08.795
Oh, my fucking God!

22:10.596 --> 22:13.032
I think we need a plan of action,
then we vote.

22:13.066 --> 22:15.034
Okay, all in favor
of continuing our discussion

22:15.068 --> 22:16.969
of what action to vote for,
raise your hand.

22:17.003 --> 22:18.905
Man, fuck this shit.

22:18.938 --> 22:20.039
What did I say?

22:20.073 --> 22:22.709
Yeah, let's do the GoFundMe page option.
Let's tweet it out right now.

22:22.742 --> 22:24.077
- I mean, I'm down.
- We should.

22:25.111 --> 22:26.112
Let's do it.

22:37.890 --> 22:38.891
Lyn.

22:38.925 --> 22:39.926
Hey.

22:41.360 --> 22:44.497
- Wait.
- Okay, before you say anything...

22:46.466 --> 22:48.568
...this huge thing just happened to me,

22:48.601 --> 22:51.137
and the only person
that I thought to come tell was you.

22:51.771 --> 22:53.673
But then I felt so selfish because of...

22:54.607 --> 22:57.777
...well, because of your dad
and how you must be feeling.

22:59.612 --> 23:01.047
Oh, hold on.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.416
Sorry. I've been waiting
for this call all fucking morning.

23:03.449 --> 23:04.484
Just one sec.

23:04.517 --> 23:05.518
Hello?

23:06.619 --> 23:07.620
Yeah.

23:08.788 --> 23:11.691
Yeah, this is Juan Sanchez, his son.

23:13.426 --> 23:14.427
Yeah.

23:14.460 --> 23:15.628
Okay.

23:18.798 --> 23:20.666
I'm telling you,
I don't know his password.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.636
Well, who still has a fax?

23:24.971 --> 23:26.606
Okay. No, it's fine.

23:26.639 --> 23:28.975
I'll send that over somehow.

23:29.809 --> 23:31.477
I'll send... Thanks.

23:33.479 --> 23:34.981
That stuff is such a nightmare.

23:35.014 --> 23:39.685
Everybody needs forms filled out,
fucking paperwork and...

23:43.156 --> 23:44.857
No jicama, right?

23:44.891 --> 23:47.160
Yeah, jicama is just a filler fruit.

23:47.827 --> 23:48.928
Thanks.

23:54.500 --> 23:56.035
What were you saying before?

23:56.068 --> 23:58.070
Oh, nothing.

24:03.042 --> 24:05.511
You got your own father stuff.

24:07.446 --> 24:10.016
What you mean "own father stuff"?

24:12.218 --> 24:13.853
J, I saw my dad...

24:14.887 --> 24:17.056
...in the flesh, undead.

24:18.858 --> 24:19.959
How?

24:21.761 --> 24:26.132
In Lincoln Heights, I just saw him.
I had a conversation with him.

24:26.165 --> 24:29.168
Vida lied about him dying, which is so...

24:29.202 --> 24:31.037
I'm so...

24:31.070 --> 24:32.738
Like, how could she?

24:32.772 --> 24:34.540
All these years, there he was.

24:34.574 --> 24:36.175
Man, I...

24:36.209 --> 24:37.777
That's fucked up.

24:41.681 --> 24:42.682
I'm sorry.

24:44.116 --> 24:45.751
I'm coming here with all my stuff,

24:45.785 --> 24:50.022
and you're still grieving
and dealing with everything.

24:50.056 --> 24:51.057
I just...

24:51.891 --> 24:54.060
I just didn't have anyone else to tell.

24:57.864 --> 24:59.232
I get it. That's...

25:00.700 --> 25:01.801
That's huge.

25:02.702 --> 25:04.036
I know, right?

25:05.905 --> 25:07.740
Emma doesn't think so.

25:09.075 --> 25:12.712
She's so uninterested
in having anything to do with him.

25:12.745 --> 25:14.046
I'm...

25:14.080 --> 25:16.048
It's just so weird to me.

25:16.082 --> 25:17.750
Well, you know...

25:19.252 --> 25:21.654
...maybe you're just supposed
to have your dad to yourself.

25:22.755 --> 25:27.126
Look, I had a long-ass time
to get to know my apá,

25:27.159 --> 25:28.261
and I just...

25:31.264 --> 25:32.265
I didn't do it.

25:34.033 --> 25:35.601
Yeah, I...

25:36.802 --> 25:38.804
I didn't really want to know him,

25:38.838 --> 25:42.541
and I don't think that he cared that much
to know me either, so...

25:44.310 --> 25:48.281
If you got a chance to know your dad
and he wants to know you, too...

25:50.716 --> 25:52.184
...I think you should take it.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.731
Hello?

26:06.766 --> 26:08.801
Anyone work here or what?

26:08.834 --> 26:11.237
- I can help you.
- Dos Coronas.

26:19.178 --> 26:20.212
Can I get a water?

26:20.246 --> 26:21.347
Yeah.

26:29.155 --> 26:31.257
Oh, Eddy. You're back!

26:31.290 --> 26:33.326
Does that mean
you cleared things up with Emma?

26:33.359 --> 26:34.360
Something.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.963
- I just saw you needed help.
- Thanks.

26:36.996 --> 26:38.864
Insider info, though,
and don't tell anyone,

26:38.898 --> 26:42.301
because I think she can probably sue us,
but now that they broke up,

26:42.335 --> 26:44.103
I bet Emma's firing Nico.

26:44.136 --> 26:48.007
'Pérame. Those two were together?

26:48.040 --> 26:51.043
Well, Emma's in denial,
but, yeah, like rabbits.

26:51.077 --> 26:53.946
Hold up. Emma's a lesbian?

26:53.980 --> 26:56.949
Well, there might have been
a "Baco the handyman" in there, too,

26:56.983 --> 26:58.751
so what is that, bi?

26:58.784 --> 27:01.053
Queer? Anything goes?

27:03.856 --> 27:05.257
Excuse me, can I get a drink?

27:06.025 --> 27:07.159
Will you get this, please?

27:07.193 --> 27:09.095
I have to go and make my big intro.

27:09.128 --> 27:11.030
- I got it, Lynny.
- Thank you.

27:12.865 --> 27:13.899
What can I get you?

27:17.203 --> 27:19.839
Thank you so much for being here.
I'll be right back.

27:21.640 --> 27:25.111
Give it up
for Mariachi Lindas Mexicanas, everyone!

27:25.144 --> 27:27.913
- ¡Sí, señor!
- Welcome.

27:27.947 --> 27:31.150
We're so happy to have you here
for Vida's very own

27:31.183 --> 27:34.754
Mariachi Karaoke, "Mariachioke"!

27:36.255 --> 27:37.256
It's pretty straightforward.

27:37.289 --> 27:42.161
You pick a song from this book
and write yourself on a list,

27:42.194 --> 27:44.964
and then these ladies will be your chorus.

27:44.997 --> 27:48.367
There are no screens here,
so if you get lost, don't worry.

27:48.401 --> 27:50.736
These lovely ladies will be your guide.

27:50.770 --> 27:53.706
And I will start things off. Hit it.

27:55.741 --> 27:57.076
Échale, Lyn.

28:39.118 --> 28:41.120
Hey, me asustaste.

28:41.921 --> 28:42.922
Shit.

28:45.858 --> 28:49.762
Sorry, I was just picking up these papers
so I can send them back.

28:49.795 --> 28:51.797
I left you the utilities right there.

28:51.831 --> 28:53.299
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

28:53.332 --> 28:55.734
Hey, are you staying
at Karla's again tonight?

28:55.768 --> 28:57.736
Yeah, why?

28:57.770 --> 28:59.171
It's hella creepy here all alone.

29:00.139 --> 29:01.874
Last night I woke up
in the middle of the night,

29:01.907 --> 29:04.443
and I swore I heard apá yelling for me.

29:05.377 --> 29:07.746
That would freak me the fuck out.

29:07.780 --> 29:10.916
Yeah, I might want to hole up
in the shop for a minute.

29:10.950 --> 29:13.018
Yeah, if you want to. It's up to you.

29:13.052 --> 29:14.487
Hey, wait. Hold on.

29:17.223 --> 29:18.924
Wait. What the fuck is this?

29:22.027 --> 29:23.429
Nothing.

29:23.462 --> 29:25.331
Things that are nothing go in the trash.

29:27.433 --> 29:28.801
I don't know, Mari.

29:30.503 --> 29:33.873
It's some lady who dropped off a card,
said she'd get us 500K for the house.

29:33.906 --> 29:36.208
And you told her to fuck off, right?

29:36.242 --> 29:38.944
I didn't tell her anything 'cause I don't
know what I'm doing with the house.

29:38.978 --> 29:41.147
What do you mean what you're doing?

29:41.180 --> 29:44.383
We would have to talk about it,
and I would say, "Fuck that."

29:44.416 --> 29:47.319
You wouldn't get to say anything
because the house is not in your name.

29:48.354 --> 29:52.224
Apá left all the responsibility,
his debt, everything, all to me.

29:53.826 --> 29:54.960
En serio, Johnny?

29:54.994 --> 29:56.162
Yeah, but I mean, look,

29:56.195 --> 29:57.496
I wouldn't leave you like that, though.

29:57.530 --> 29:59.165
I mean, I wouldn't leave you
without somewhere to live.

29:59.198 --> 30:00.499
I just...

30:00.533 --> 30:02.268
I just took the card
just to think about it.

30:03.903 --> 30:08.240
Even after I was his fucking nurse,
maid, and cook...

30:09.542 --> 30:12.144
...he couldn't even fucking leave me
a piece of the house.

30:13.379 --> 30:15.181
Mari, you know how he was.

30:16.215 --> 30:17.216
Yeah.

30:39.271 --> 30:41.540
Che, glad to have you back.

30:42.875 --> 30:46.178
So tonight we're gonna go
a little fancier than usual.

30:46.212 --> 30:49.215
House margarita is a jalapeño mix.

30:49.248 --> 30:52.084
Don't touch it. It's done, okay?

30:52.618 --> 30:56.422
Herbal sprigs are in this mason jar,
but use 'em sparingly.

30:58.090 --> 31:00.025
If I'm going to...

31:00.059 --> 31:01.527
I need some of that liquid courage.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.462
Lyn said there was
a special margarita tonight.

31:03.495 --> 31:05.864
That's right, boss.

31:05.898 --> 31:07.066
Coming up.

31:07.933 --> 31:10.169
Emma, Lyn did so good.

31:10.202 --> 31:11.370
Yeah.

31:22.281 --> 31:23.916
Qué es esto?

31:23.949 --> 31:26.151
I'm sorry.
This is a little too involved for me.

31:26.185 --> 31:28.254
Could I just get, like, a regular?

31:28.287 --> 31:30.189
Give me a Cuba Libre or something.

31:30.222 --> 31:32.124
No.

31:32.157 --> 31:33.492
I premade the mix.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.229
Okay, well, can I get a Tecate?

31:37.263 --> 31:39.098
Yeah. No.

31:39.632 --> 31:41.900
Actually, I want to watch you drink that.

31:43.636 --> 31:44.637
Tell me it's bad.

31:46.071 --> 31:47.072
Nico.

31:49.441 --> 31:51.110
I'll get you a Tecate.

31:54.480 --> 31:57.182
No, it's fine.

31:57.216 --> 31:58.651
It turns out I don't need it after all.

32:02.388 --> 32:04.089
Hey. What was that?

32:04.123 --> 32:05.257
I don't know.

32:06.158 --> 32:09.461
Listen, I'm not dealing well
with the whole...

32:11.430 --> 32:15.334
I'm having a hard time
being in the space with you.

32:17.336 --> 32:19.104
I'm going back to old patterns
that I thought...

32:19.138 --> 32:21.974
- What patterns?
- Oh, don't act like you fucking care now.

32:24.343 --> 32:27.012
You canceled us with no discussion,
no conversation.

32:27.046 --> 32:29.581
You wouldn't hear me out,
so don't act like this matters to you.

32:29.615 --> 32:33.652
Nico, you don't not matter to me.

32:35.587 --> 32:37.156
Hey, you know what?

32:38.590 --> 32:41.527
If you don't mind,
and since you got Eddy here...

32:42.561 --> 32:44.496
...could you cut me early tonight?

32:44.530 --> 32:46.565
I got to set my head on straight.

32:46.598 --> 32:49.501
I promise I'll be back tomorrow, reset,

32:49.535 --> 32:52.338
and ready to act like
the person that you hired.

32:52.371 --> 32:57.076
Yeah! All right, and now
we have the Bell Marcos up next.

32:57.109 --> 32:59.211
- Yeah, of course.
- Come on, Marquitos!

33:01.046 --> 33:02.047
Thank you.

33:02.081 --> 33:03.549
I'll grab my stuff and...

33:06.385 --> 33:07.553
See you later.

33:09.221 --> 33:13.392
Esta se la dedico al último cabrón
that broke my heart.

34:13.619 --> 34:16.054
Would you mind the bar, Eddy?

35:02.501 --> 35:03.669
See?

35:07.506 --> 35:08.841
Fuckboy.

35:23.822 --> 35:25.424
You don't deserve that.

35:29.194 --> 35:33.298
I actually don't have a right
to feel this way.

35:33.332 --> 35:37.169
- I'm just angry with myself that I...
- No, Em, no.

35:38.704 --> 35:41.540
Any way you slice it,
Nico broke your trust.

35:44.276 --> 35:45.711
And you deserve the truth.

35:55.220 --> 35:57.356
I saw papi today.

36:00.626 --> 36:03.161
What do you mean you saw him?

36:04.530 --> 36:05.731
Like, I...

36:07.733 --> 36:12.404
I figured out where his church was,
and I went to meet him.

36:17.643 --> 36:19.578
Mami made him stay away.

36:19.611 --> 36:20.879
Did you know that?

36:22.247 --> 36:24.583
He wanted to see us this whole time.

36:24.616 --> 36:27.686
I thought we said
we weren't going to see him.

36:27.719 --> 36:29.821
Em, I don't want to split hairs
with you on this,

36:29.855 --> 36:31.924
especially with how
you're feeling right now,

36:31.957 --> 36:36.295
but you said we weren't going to see him.

36:37.663 --> 36:39.898
You made that decision for both of us.

36:45.537 --> 36:48.273
I don't want to let Vida
do any more damage.

36:52.611 --> 36:54.613
I have a second chance...

36:56.782 --> 36:59.551
...to get to know him,
and he wants to know me, too.

36:59.585 --> 37:01.253
He wants to know both of us.

37:03.422 --> 37:04.823
Emma, I don't want to fight.

37:04.856 --> 37:06.291
This isn't a fight, Lyn.

37:08.694 --> 37:10.395
You can do what you want.

37:10.963 --> 37:12.965
I want us to still be good.

37:14.399 --> 37:15.500
Okay?

37:20.806 --> 37:22.808
I'm gonna head downstairs.

37:28.347 --> 37:29.648
I love you.
