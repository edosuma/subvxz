WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:04.738
(phone ringing)

00:04.772 --> 00:06.807
Hi, it's Poodle,
leave a message.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.742
(beep)
Oh, hey, Poodle.

00:08.776 --> 00:10.211
Hey, it's me, Mickey, again.

00:10.244 --> 00:12.146
Uh, remember me? The one
you saddled with your kids,

00:12.180 --> 00:13.414
who are awful, by the way.

00:13.447 --> 00:16.250
Listen, I was just--
I had this thought that

00:16.284 --> 00:17.851
maybe if you had
a couple spare minutes,

00:17.885 --> 00:19.187
you could give 'em a call

00:19.220 --> 00:20.654
and let them know
that you fled the country

00:20.688 --> 00:22.156
and left them
with a total stranger,

00:22.190 --> 00:25.759
you stupid, selfish monsters!

00:25.793 --> 00:27.361
Anyway, give me a call.

00:27.395 --> 00:30.364
Aah!

00:30.398 --> 00:31.332
(sighs)

00:31.365 --> 00:33.634
(toilet flushes)
Okay.

00:39.807 --> 00:40.908
(inhales)

00:40.941 --> 00:43.177
(exhales)

00:43.211 --> 00:45.113
You got this.

00:48.716 --> 00:51.385
Ah! Touchdown!

00:51.419 --> 00:53.354
Her turn, hit her
with a shrimp!

00:53.387 --> 00:54.722
No, no, thank you.

00:54.755 --> 00:55.956
I'm not trying to get hepatitis.

00:55.989 --> 00:57.691
I want hepatitis.

00:57.725 --> 00:58.626
Coming your way, buddy!

01:00.261 --> 01:01.362
This is awesome, right, guys?

01:01.395 --> 01:03.364
Why are we in a poor
person's restaurant?

01:03.397 --> 01:04.865
What's the matter
with you?

01:04.898 --> 01:07.368
It's not a poor person's
restaurant-- don't be an ass.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.370
This guy's not even Japanese.
His name's Pedro.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.439
All right, well, Hamilton
wasn't Puerto Rican,

01:11.472 --> 01:13.241
but people seem to be
enjoying that just fine.

01:13.274 --> 01:15.776
All right, listen, I brought
you guys here because I,

01:15.809 --> 01:17.945
I got to tell you some pretty
big news, and it's not...

01:17.978 --> 01:19.913
Pass.
Pass? What are...?

01:19.947 --> 01:21.482
You gonna pop those in
right now? Are you kidding me?

01:21.515 --> 01:23.951
Fine. Forget you.
Ben, Chip, listen.

01:23.984 --> 01:25.386
This is going to be
pretty hard to...
Hey, Ben,

01:25.419 --> 01:26.387
I dare you
to lick the grill.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.256
What? Shut up!
Just listen to me.

01:28.289 --> 01:29.390
What's it taste like?

01:29.423 --> 01:30.491
Oh, it's delicious!
Come on,

01:30.524 --> 01:31.659
I'll give you a thousand bucks.

01:31.692 --> 01:33.961
No, don't. He does not have
a thousand dollars.

01:33.994 --> 01:34.895
Boom.
Oh, my God.

01:34.928 --> 01:37.231
You are a nightmare.
Ben, don't do it, okay?

01:37.265 --> 01:38.566
Will you just please listen?
Sabrina, this is serious.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.934
Don't touch
my stuff, psycho.

01:40.968 --> 01:42.836
I just thought you might like to
know that your parents are gone

01:42.870 --> 01:44.605
and they're not coming back.

01:47.775 --> 01:49.277
They're dead?

01:49.310 --> 01:50.411
No, no. Not dead.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.246
They're definitely not dead.

01:52.280 --> 01:53.914
But they did
flee the country.

01:53.947 --> 01:57.084
That doesn't make any sense.
They didn't do anything wrong.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.519
Uh, I don't, I don't,
I don't know.

01:58.552 --> 01:59.653
I'm not going
to touch that one.

01:59.687 --> 02:01.522
No, I don't believe you.
You're lying.

02:01.555 --> 02:02.523
Why would I lie
about that?

02:02.556 --> 02:03.757
Um, I don't know,
maybe because

02:03.791 --> 02:04.958
you're a lying bitch.

02:04.992 --> 02:06.927
Okay, look, I understand this
is really hard stuff to hear.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.095
It's not hard to hear.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.530
It's actually really easy.

02:09.563 --> 02:11.599
I, like, literally
don't care at all.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.434
Okay, well the pitch of your
voice is making it seem

02:13.467 --> 02:15.203
like you care a lot.
I don't care!

02:15.236 --> 02:16.770
It's just-- it's
embarrassing, that's all.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.506
Yes, it is, it is, agreed.
It's very embarrassing.

02:18.539 --> 02:20.841
Let's just keep
our voices down, okay?

02:20.874 --> 02:23.444
These gentlemen are trying
to enjoy their dinner.

02:23.477 --> 02:24.945
You think I care
about these idiots?

02:24.978 --> 02:26.880
Uh, sorry.

02:26.914 --> 02:28.949
What is wrong with you?
You're making a scene.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.485
Oh, oh. I'm so, I'm so sorry.

02:31.519 --> 02:33.221
Let me make it right.

02:33.254 --> 02:35.723
How is that for a scene?

02:35.756 --> 02:39.059
Dinner and a show!
Lap it up, you dogs!

02:39.092 --> 02:41.462
Hey, get-get back
over here right now!

02:41.495 --> 02:42.830
Oh, don't tell us what to do!
You're not our mom.

02:42.863 --> 02:44.965
You're just looking
for a handout.
Hey, Sabrina...

02:44.998 --> 02:48.035
You with your bad hair
and your Dumpster clothes!

02:48.068 --> 02:49.670
I know what you're up to,
and I'll tell you something,

02:49.703 --> 02:51.572
you're not going
to get away with that.

02:51.605 --> 02:52.573
(sizzles)

02:52.606 --> 02:55.175
Aah...!

02:55.209 --> 02:57.144
Well, I hope you're
very proud of yourself.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.179
Your brother has burned off
all of his taste buds.

02:59.213 --> 03:00.981
CHIP: I'd like to apologize
for my behavior.

03:01.014 --> 03:04.752
I understand, as the new
patriarch of this family,

03:04.785 --> 03:06.387
you are all looking
to me to set the tone,

03:06.420 --> 03:08.389
and I fell short.
Stop it, okay?

03:08.422 --> 03:10.324
Nobody's looking to you
for anything.

03:10.358 --> 03:11.692
Oh, I'm sorry.
You think you're in charge?

03:11.725 --> 03:13.827
We're not gonna listen
to a single word you say.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.396
Well, you're not gonna have to.
'Cause I'm catching

03:15.429 --> 03:17.365
the last chopper out of Saigon.

03:17.398 --> 03:18.999
You're leaving?

03:19.032 --> 03:20.334
Yeah, Alba, I'm leaving.

03:20.368 --> 03:22.503
Have you seen that car outside?
That's a pig.

03:22.536 --> 03:25.839
Probably FBI. And I'm pretty
sure the IRS is not far behind.

03:25.873 --> 03:29.343
And once all this is gone, Alba,
all that's left is this.

03:29.377 --> 03:32.079
And nobody wants just this.

03:32.112 --> 03:33.180
Well, where you gonna go?

03:33.213 --> 03:34.348
I'm gonna go back
to Rhode Island.

03:34.382 --> 03:35.516
Where I have
no responsibilities

03:35.549 --> 03:37.518
and nobody to answer to.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.753
So, unemployed and alone?

03:39.787 --> 03:40.954
Sounds neat.

03:40.988 --> 03:41.855
I wish I could bash you.

03:41.889 --> 03:42.890
Okay, thank you for your
time, Mackenzie,

03:42.923 --> 03:44.258
but I think
I've got it from here.

03:44.292 --> 03:46.894
Oh, wonderful. I bet you do,
Chip. Great. But just in case,

03:46.927 --> 03:48.962
I've called your dad's parents,
and they're on their way.

03:48.996 --> 03:51.365
The colonel? No way.
That guy's a legend.

03:51.399 --> 03:53.401
I've modeled
my entire career after him.

03:53.434 --> 03:54.402
O-Oh, yes.
I-I like

03:54.435 --> 03:55.703
the colonel very much.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.638
When I was a little girl,
he came to my village

03:57.671 --> 03:59.540
in Guatemala
and built the hospital.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.975
And then he brought me and
my mother back to the States.

04:02.009 --> 04:04.745
He would call me his libélula--

04:04.778 --> 04:06.213
dragonfly.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.881
And you've been
trapped here ever since?

04:07.915 --> 04:09.116
Ugh.
You're like a veal.

04:09.149 --> 04:10.918
Got to get out more.
Wait,

04:10.951 --> 04:13.053
aren't he and Grandma Tippy,
like, 100 years old?

04:13.086 --> 04:15.423
They sounded about 1,000
on the phone, so I'm gonna

04:15.456 --> 04:16.790
get out of here
before I get stuck

04:16.824 --> 04:18.559
talking about
soup or whatever.

04:18.592 --> 04:19.560
SABRINA:
Fine, go.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.061
You think I care?

04:21.094 --> 04:23.397
Why are you
taking our stuff?

04:23.431 --> 04:25.566
Call it payment
for services rendered.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.935
You get that for living in
our mansion for three days?

04:27.968 --> 04:30.070
Well, I was eyeing the G-wagon
but I didn't want to be

04:30.103 --> 04:33.106
gassing up the whole time,
so I decided to go solar.

04:33.140 --> 04:34.742
It's electric.
I know, right?

04:34.775 --> 04:37.244
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I'm coming with you.

04:37.277 --> 04:38.412
What? No, you're not.

04:38.446 --> 04:40.814
W... We are friends, yes?

04:40.848 --> 04:42.416
Well, I mean, yeah.

04:42.450 --> 04:43.684
We're friendly.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.419
But I...
You know, I-I already

04:45.453 --> 04:47.154
got the rug and...

04:47.187 --> 04:48.422
Plus, the kids need you.

04:48.456 --> 04:49.423
No, we don't.
Take her.

04:49.457 --> 04:50.758
Miss Mickey,
when I

04:50.791 --> 04:52.626
smashed that man over the head,

04:52.660 --> 04:55.763
I felt an animal in my chest
wake up and roar.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.098
I would very much
like to feel that again.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.834
Okay. I mean, how am I
supposed to argue with that?

05:00.868 --> 05:03.437
Fine, come along for a couple
days, but you got to keep up,

05:03.471 --> 05:04.638
all right? I don't
feel like babysitting.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.774
Otherwise I'd stay
with these animals.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.275
Oh, uh...

05:08.308 --> 05:10.611
but i-it's up to you, Benito.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.546
I will only go
if I have your blessing.

05:12.580 --> 05:15.115
Okay.
Mm.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.850
Okay, let's go.

05:16.884 --> 05:19.186
Well, that about does it.
Good luck to you.

05:19.219 --> 05:21.188
Uh, take care of yourselves.

05:21.221 --> 05:22.723
And if you need anything at all,

05:22.756 --> 05:25.325
do not hesitate to call 911.

05:25.359 --> 05:27.227
Hold onto your nips,

05:27.260 --> 05:28.762
this kitty can purr.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.134
What's shakin', bacon?

05:34.167 --> 05:35.903
Excuse me?

05:35.936 --> 05:38.406
You're excused.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.312
A little hustle, please.
The colonel's waiting.
So what?

05:45.345 --> 05:46.647
So show some respect.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.815
He's a freaking war hero.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.983
Dude went buck wild on Korea.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.752
Look at this beast.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.487
If there was ever a guy to
surrender the patriarch role to,

05:53.521 --> 05:55.322
it's this stud.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.057
(doorbell rings)

05:58.191 --> 05:59.326
What?

05:59.359 --> 06:00.327
Hello!

06:00.360 --> 06:01.595
Oh, my goodness,

06:01.629 --> 06:05.365
look how big
you've all gotten!

06:05.399 --> 06:07.234
(gasps)
Sabrina.

06:07.267 --> 06:10.538
My beautiful angel.

06:10.571 --> 06:13.373
And Chip, such a dashing
young gentleman.

06:13.407 --> 06:14.742
You remind me
of my husband.

06:14.775 --> 06:16.944
Oh, and Ben,
my poor baby.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.679
I heard about that

06:18.712 --> 06:21.114
little accident you had.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.850
Hello, Grandma.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.852
Now, it has been
a long day,

06:24.885 --> 06:27.187
so why don't we
all go upstairs

06:27.220 --> 06:29.757
and change
into our PJs?

06:29.790 --> 06:30.924
(chuckles)

06:30.958 --> 06:33.026
Yeah, sorry, Grandma,
that's not gonna work for me.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.195
I've got a party to go to
tonight. And I probably won't

06:35.228 --> 06:37.898
get home until late, so, you
know what, don't wait up for me.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.467
You guys... Oh!

06:39.500 --> 06:41.268
I realize
you children

06:41.301 --> 06:42.736
aren't used to having rules,

06:42.770 --> 06:44.705
but all that's going
to change. Now,

06:44.738 --> 06:47.641
be a good girl
and do as Grandma says.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.544
No.

06:50.578 --> 06:51.879
(gasps)
CHIP: Whoa.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.146
I think you'll
find I have

06:53.180 --> 06:56.083
very little tolerance
for back sass, dear.

06:57.184 --> 06:58.786
Upstairs.

07:04.157 --> 07:05.726
(door opens)
MICKEY: So, of course,

07:05.759 --> 07:07.561
I'm trying to convince him
it was just a rash,

07:07.595 --> 07:09.229
but, you know,
he wasn't buying it.
Oh.

07:09.262 --> 07:12.232
You know, when I was
a little girl, a rash spread

07:12.265 --> 07:14.602
through our village and nearly
took all of the women.

07:14.635 --> 07:17.237
Oh. Right on.
Yeah.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.573
Very cool that we both
have rash stories.
Uh-huh.

07:19.607 --> 07:21.675
So, this is it.
Home, sweet home.

07:21.709 --> 07:23.110
(airplane whooshes)

07:23.143 --> 07:25.345
Oh, yeah, I live real close
to the airport.

07:25.378 --> 07:27.314
Super convenient.
Thirsty?

07:27.347 --> 07:28.415
Yeah.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.650
Cheers.
Oh.

07:29.683 --> 07:30.818
Ah.

07:30.851 --> 07:32.185
Mm.

07:32.219 --> 07:33.587
Mm-hmm.
Oh.

07:33.621 --> 07:34.922
Mm, mm.
There we go.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.089
Cheers.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.425
(toilet flushing)

07:38.458 --> 07:39.960
(gasps)

07:39.993 --> 07:41.194
Jimmy?!

07:41.228 --> 07:44.097
Holy crap,
you're alive.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.766
Oh, you look good.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.200
What? No. Get-Get off of me!
You look really good.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.469
What are you doing?
Oh, I'm happy to see you.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.039
Hi. Hey.
ALBA: Mm.

07:52.072 --> 07:52.940
I'm Jimmy.
Oh.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.775
I'm the boyfriend.
He's not my boyfriend.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.343
Oh, come on. We've been plowing
for, like, ten years...

07:56.376 --> 07:57.344
What are you
doing here, Jimmy?

07:57.377 --> 07:59.146
Are you living in my place?

07:59.179 --> 08:01.515
No. The...
the pipe is just, like...

08:01.549 --> 08:02.716
Oh, the pipe?
Yeah, and it...

08:02.750 --> 08:04.217
there's a, there's a...
you got a drippy...

08:04.251 --> 08:05.352
I got a drippy?

08:05.385 --> 08:06.620
(sighs)

08:06.654 --> 08:07.888
I missed the smells.

08:07.921 --> 08:08.956
Okay, well,
you can smell my ass

08:08.989 --> 08:10.223
when you kiss it
good-bye. Leave.

08:10.257 --> 08:12.459
Okay, you know what, I'm sensing
some major hostility here,

08:12.492 --> 08:15.495
which is fine, but is it
about the car thing?

08:15.529 --> 08:17.130
The car thing
where you ran me over?

08:17.164 --> 08:18.465
Yeah.
Yes, it is.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.633
Okay. Well, I said
I was sorry.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.001
No, you didn't say
you were sorry.

08:21.034 --> 08:22.369
I'm saying it now.

08:22.402 --> 08:23.370
Jimmy, you didn't even stop.

08:23.403 --> 08:25.973
I thought you were dead!

08:26.006 --> 08:27.040
Did you stop?

08:27.074 --> 08:29.376
Did you stop and think
about how it made me feel?

08:29.409 --> 08:31.078
Get out!

08:31.111 --> 08:32.179
I'm serious.
Get out.

08:32.212 --> 08:33.046
Oh, fine!

08:33.080 --> 08:36.016
Well, guess what.
I don't need this,

08:36.049 --> 08:38.051
and I don't need you
and I don't need this robe.

08:38.085 --> 08:40.087
Come on. Keep the robe.
I don't want the robe.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.021
No, I don't want it.

08:41.054 --> 08:43.090
It makes me think of you,
and I hate it.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.026
Wha...

08:46.059 --> 08:47.260
Hold on.

08:47.294 --> 08:49.096
Did you get a new tattoo?

08:49.129 --> 08:50.931
Yeah, I did.

08:52.065 --> 08:53.200
I regret it.

08:53.233 --> 08:53.867
Mm.

08:53.901 --> 08:56.604
Oh. And a word to the wise:

08:56.637 --> 08:58.572
that loan shark
from the Indian casino,

08:58.606 --> 09:01.074
he's been poking around,
so when he comes to get...

09:01.108 --> 09:02.342
He reminds me

09:02.375 --> 09:03.410
of my cousin, Victor.

09:03.443 --> 09:05.178
In the womb for 14 months.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.379
Big head.

09:06.413 --> 09:07.781
Very sad.
Yeah.

09:07.815 --> 09:09.416
Don't pay attention to him.
He's no one.
Mm-hmm.

09:09.449 --> 09:10.618
Hey, you want
to get out of here,

09:10.651 --> 09:12.019
go crank the lights up
on this town?

09:12.052 --> 09:13.921
(laughs): I don't
know what you say.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.522
That's okay.
Uh, just take this,

09:15.555 --> 09:17.357
and I will explain
the rest later.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.360
Oh. No. No, thank you.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.929
Oh, don't worry--
it's super mild.

09:21.962 --> 09:24.632
Oh, no, no, I-I can't, 'cause
I have a sensitive stomach.

09:24.665 --> 09:26.366
Me, too. Just take half.
No, it's-it's no good.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.702
Just put it on your tongue
and tell me what it tastes like.

09:28.736 --> 09:30.037
I can't do it! It's not good.
Alba,

09:30.070 --> 09:32.039
friends trust each other.
Plea...

09:32.072 --> 09:33.440
I said no!

09:33.473 --> 09:35.909
I'll fire you if you don't.

09:38.478 --> 09:40.113
(laughing):
I'm just kidding!

09:40.147 --> 09:42.616
Oh, I'm so sorry. Your face.
I scared you.
(panting)

09:42.650 --> 09:44.317
I can't fire you--
you're not even mine.

09:44.351 --> 09:45.252
(both laughing)

09:45.285 --> 09:48.321
You don't have to take it.
Oh, thank you.

09:48.355 --> 09:49.556
'Cause you already took it.

09:49.589 --> 09:50.891
Wait, what?
Mm.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.426
I popped one
in your beer earlier.

09:53.460 --> 09:55.929
Uh... no, y-you're joking.

09:55.963 --> 09:58.565
This is a joke, right?

09:58.598 --> 10:00.567
Of course I'm joking!
Oh.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.835
(laughing):
Who would do that?

10:01.869 --> 10:03.904
Oh... I can't tell,
I can't tell.
I know.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.472
Actually, I'm joking
about joking.

10:05.505 --> 10:07.240
I'd say you have
about ten minutes.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.276
Wha...? Oh. Oh, no, no.

10:09.309 --> 10:10.978
Yeah. You know what,
I'm gonna go freshen up.

10:11.011 --> 10:12.780
This is gonna be fun.
Don't leave. No.

10:12.813 --> 10:15.315
Oh. (grunting)

10:17.450 --> 10:18.318
Oh! What are you doing?

10:18.351 --> 10:19.920
I was gonna go make
a grilled cheese.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.421
What are you doing?
I'm going out.

10:21.454 --> 10:24.591
What if Grandma wakes up?
Well, you can tell her
to eat a big fat...

10:24.624 --> 10:26.093
And where might you two
be going?

10:26.126 --> 10:27.594
I was just going
to make a grilled cheese.

10:27.627 --> 10:28.929
Huh?

10:28.962 --> 10:31.765
No, I-I was gonna go
make a grilled cheese.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.867
Ah, what a coincidence--
everyone's got

10:33.901 --> 10:36.303
a midnight hankering
for some grilled cheese.

10:36.336 --> 10:39.106
Okay, fine, I'm going out.
My friend Fuji is deejaying.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.508
Oh, how fun.
Did you hear that, Colonel?

10:41.541 --> 10:43.777
Fuji is deejaying.
Look, it's not

10:43.811 --> 10:45.445
that big of a deal--
I'm just going dancing.

10:45.478 --> 10:48.281
Oh. Well, why didn't you say so?
You can dance right here.

10:48.315 --> 10:49.282
What?

10:49.316 --> 10:51.518
You heard me. Dance.

10:51.551 --> 10:53.453
Come on, Grandma,
this is insane.

10:53.486 --> 10:54.755
Dance!

10:57.157 --> 10:59.126
(snickers)

10:59.159 --> 11:00.393
(laughs)

11:00.427 --> 11:03.997
You gentlemen aren't going to
let a lady dance alone, are you?

11:04.031 --> 11:05.632
Go on.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.234
Join her.

11:08.936 --> 11:11.638
(gasps softly)
That's better.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.540
Now we're having fun.

11:13.573 --> 11:15.709
(dance beat plays)

11:15.743 --> 11:17.711
*

11:19.346 --> 11:21.481
How you doing
over there?

11:21.514 --> 11:23.817
I... Good, I think.
Yeah?

11:23.851 --> 11:25.685
My legs are heavy, but...

11:25.719 --> 11:27.354
my mind is light.

11:27.387 --> 11:30.557
And my back is slick
with a river of sweat.

11:30.590 --> 11:32.692
I feel relaxed but...

11:32.726 --> 11:34.161
also focused.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.096
Kind of warm, too.
Mm-hmm.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.165
Overall, good.
I feel good!

11:38.198 --> 11:40.167
Great. That was a
lot of info there.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.902
Thank you so much.
Yeah. Mm.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.837
Mm!

11:43.871 --> 11:45.672
Whoa-whoa! That's not
what you want to gulp.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.107
Mm-mm. Mm.
No... no guzzling.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.708
All right,
that's on you.

11:48.742 --> 11:49.943
Do you want to go dance?

11:49.977 --> 11:52.245
Yeah, lead the way, bitch!
Yeah!

11:52.279 --> 11:54.381
*

12:03.891 --> 12:05.893
(retching)

12:07.494 --> 12:08.461
(unzips)

12:08.495 --> 12:10.463
Mm-hmm.

12:10.497 --> 12:12.766
*

12:34.988 --> 12:36.890
(airplane whooshing)
Aah! We're gonna die!

12:36.924 --> 12:38.058
(screams)

12:38.091 --> 12:40.393
What? What?
Okay, okay, we're home.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.662
We're home. Right on.

12:42.695 --> 12:45.265
Ay. Oh, my mind is in pain.

12:45.298 --> 12:46.499
Oh, Alba,

12:46.533 --> 12:47.935
God, do you have to scream?

12:47.968 --> 12:49.469
It's like nails
in a blender.

12:49.502 --> 12:52.505
Let's just get inside
and pass out, and then...

12:52.539 --> 12:56.443
Wait, why is my window open?

12:56.476 --> 12:59.079
Didn't Jimmy mention something
about a loan shark?

12:59.112 --> 13:01.614
Hold on a second.
I got to make a phone call.

13:01.648 --> 13:05.585
Oh, the words you say
mean n-nothing.
Just shu... sh-sh-sh-shush.

13:05.618 --> 13:06.920
JIMMY: Yo.
You're killing me.

13:06.954 --> 13:08.455
Oh, hey, Jimmy, hey.
How's my big, sexy

13:08.488 --> 13:10.190
side of beef, huh?
What are you doing?

13:10.223 --> 13:12.259
Just dumping out.
I ate some leftover clams

13:12.292 --> 13:14.862
for breakfast-- they're
wreaking havoc on my insides.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.796
What's up with you?

13:17.630 --> 13:18.932
Nothing. Uh...

13:18.966 --> 13:21.501
I just was hoping that
you could come over here

13:21.534 --> 13:23.937
and... wreak havoc
on my insides.

13:23.971 --> 13:26.539
Oh. You do, do you?

13:26.573 --> 13:27.774
Yeah. Big-time.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.776
Uh... get over here.
Take me.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.278
You asked for it.

13:31.311 --> 13:34.147
I'm gonna mop up,
and I'll be right ov...
(groans) I mean...

13:36.149 --> 13:38.118
Grandma says come
down for break...

13:38.151 --> 13:39.486
What are you doing?

13:39.519 --> 13:42.155
This woman needs to know
who she's messing with.

13:42.189 --> 13:44.391
You sure that's a good idea?
Oh, it's all part of the dance.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.493
She came at me,
now I'll come at her,

13:46.526 --> 13:50.330
and round and round we'll go in
this cruel little game of wits.

13:50.363 --> 13:51.798
You sound insane.

13:51.831 --> 13:52.799
Do I?!

13:52.832 --> 13:54.868
I learned it
from Mickey.

13:54.902 --> 13:57.570
At least she appreciated
a healthy rivalry.

13:57.604 --> 13:59.506
Come on.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.308
Ah.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.142
Ow!

14:02.175 --> 14:03.410
That's the
colonel's bacon!

14:03.443 --> 14:05.979
You can have bacon
when you earn bacon.

14:06.013 --> 14:09.149
You children have
been spoiled rotten.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.583
I mean, for
goodness' sake,

14:10.617 --> 14:11.985
Ben is the only one

14:12.019 --> 14:13.420
of you with any manners.

14:13.453 --> 14:16.323
Now, I suppose
it's not entirely your fault.

14:16.356 --> 14:19.326
I blame my idiot son
and that whore mother of yours.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.194
But I will
restore dignity

14:21.228 --> 14:24.864
to our family
if it's the last thing I do.

14:24.898 --> 14:26.333
Chip, from now on,

14:26.366 --> 14:28.001
you'll be
the colonel's apprentice.

14:28.035 --> 14:29.937
You can start by cutting
his food into little pieces

14:29.970 --> 14:31.371
and feeding him.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.006
Doesn't he have
a nurse for that?

14:33.040 --> 14:34.574
He does. You.

14:34.607 --> 14:37.377
And, uh, little Miss
Rosemary Kennedy here

14:37.410 --> 14:38.378
will learn to behave

14:38.411 --> 14:41.381
like a lady, or she will
suffer the consequences.

14:41.414 --> 14:42.882
Yes, Grandma.
Whatever you say.

14:42.916 --> 14:44.417
Good.
(chuckles)

14:44.451 --> 14:48.888
Now, if you don't mind,
I'd like to enjoy my coffee.

14:48.922 --> 14:50.223
(sighs)

14:51.624 --> 14:53.526
(gasps)
Oh!

14:53.560 --> 14:54.761
What?
(scoffs)

14:54.794 --> 14:55.895
What?

14:55.929 --> 14:57.864
You ruined my blouse,
you wrinkly bitch!

14:57.897 --> 15:01.268
Your blouse was ruined by
your inability to fill it out.

15:01.301 --> 15:02.802
(scoffs)
Now, go put on

15:02.835 --> 15:04.737
a fresh pot.

15:04.771 --> 15:06.906
(exhales)

15:08.575 --> 15:10.944
(tires screech)

15:12.079 --> 15:14.948
(car door shuts)
Let's do this.

15:14.982 --> 15:16.616
Oh, yeah, here we go.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.385
(exhales)
Oh, yeah.

15:18.418 --> 15:21.388
*

15:21.421 --> 15:22.389
(grunts)

15:22.422 --> 15:23.556
Oh, sh...

15:23.590 --> 15:25.092
(grunting)

15:25.125 --> 15:26.326
Wait, wait.

15:26.359 --> 15:29.262
(grunting)

15:29.296 --> 15:30.030
Ooh.

15:30.830 --> 15:31.831
My goodness.

15:31.864 --> 15:33.400
(grunts)

15:33.433 --> 15:34.901
(panting)

15:34.934 --> 15:36.103
Mickey?

15:37.304 --> 15:39.339
Mickey.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.108
Time to boogie.
Do something!

15:41.141 --> 15:42.242
Don't worry,
I got this.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.576
Suck solar, bitch.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.078
(engine revs)

15:45.112 --> 15:46.413
(battery dies)

15:46.446 --> 15:47.680
(beeping)

15:47.714 --> 15:48.515
What-What's happening?

15:48.548 --> 15:51.284
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

15:51.318 --> 15:52.752
Hey.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.754
(groans)

15:54.787 --> 15:56.923
$4,200, Mick.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.158
Where is it?

15:58.191 --> 15:59.459
Where do you think it is?

15:59.492 --> 16:01.528
Do I look
like I'm playing games?
Okay.

16:01.561 --> 16:04.597
I don't have it. But what do you
say you take that car out front

16:04.631 --> 16:05.665
and we call it even, huh?

16:05.698 --> 16:06.599
I don't want your stolen car.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.701
I'm a loan shark,
not a car thief.

16:08.735 --> 16:11.204
(groans)
Sit. Both of you.

16:11.238 --> 16:16.109
Mickey, I am scared.
Your life is very sad.

16:16.143 --> 16:17.844
Yes, I know that, okay?
Thank you.

16:17.877 --> 16:18.945
I want to go home to Greenwich.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.980
It's too late.
We've burned that bridge.

16:21.014 --> 16:21.814
You burned that bridge.

16:21.848 --> 16:22.815
We both burned that bridge.

16:22.849 --> 16:24.217
It doesn't matter
who lit the match.

16:24.251 --> 16:26.386
We must beg their forgiveness.
Mr. Chip will give you

16:26.419 --> 16:28.121
the money to pay
for this mess.
No.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.523
I am not borrowing money
from a 12-year-old.

16:31.491 --> 16:32.625
Honestly, Mickey,

16:32.659 --> 16:33.860
I'm depressed for you.

16:33.893 --> 16:35.162
You literally have nothing.

16:35.195 --> 16:36.529
Yeah, that's what I said.

16:36.563 --> 16:39.399
Well, I hate to do it,
but you leave me no choice.

16:39.432 --> 16:41.501
Put your hand flat on the table.

16:41.534 --> 16:44.003
Okay, look, I know you got to do
the whole tough guy routine,

16:44.037 --> 16:45.538
but, listen,
you and I, we all know

16:45.572 --> 16:47.240
that you're not
actually gonna hit a lady.

16:47.274 --> 16:49.709
Oh, my God!
(screaming)

16:49.742 --> 16:51.811
Oh! You crushed me!

16:51.844 --> 16:53.713
Next hand. Hurry. I got to
pick my boy up from day care.

16:53.746 --> 16:55.682
No, no, no, no, no! I got
the money, I got the money.

16:55.715 --> 16:58.318
Where?
It's in Connecticut.
Just give me a couple hours.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.352
You think I'm an idiot?

16:59.386 --> 17:01.588
Give me that hand!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

17:01.621 --> 17:03.990
I'll leave you Alba
as collateral.

17:04.023 --> 17:04.824
What?!

17:04.857 --> 17:06.326
Hurry.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.595
What?
(whimpering)
Please don't leave me.

17:08.628 --> 17:11.331
Alba, listen to me. You got
to trust me right now, okay?

17:11.364 --> 17:12.599
Please trust me.
No,

17:12.632 --> 17:14.434
I don't trust you.
You drugged me.

17:14.467 --> 17:15.502
Well, that was
for your own good.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.337
I mean, look how far
you've come.

17:17.370 --> 17:19.872
(whimpering)
All right, listen,

17:19.906 --> 17:21.708
I need you to do me a favor.
I did you a favor.

17:21.741 --> 17:24.144
It's your turn to do me a favor.
That's what best friends do.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.346
We are best friends?

17:26.379 --> 17:28.348
Well, I don't know. Are we?

17:28.381 --> 17:29.316
Yeah...
All right.

17:33.553 --> 17:37.290
"Meh, meh, meh. Look at me. I'm
the colonel. I'm a war hero."

17:37.324 --> 17:39.592
I'll show you a war,
you old bastard.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.695
What happened to you?!

17:42.729 --> 17:43.930
I loved you,
Grandpa!

17:43.963 --> 17:45.098
I loved you!

17:45.132 --> 17:47.100
(shouting)

17:47.134 --> 17:48.535
What are you doing?

17:48.568 --> 17:49.436
Huh?

17:50.403 --> 17:53.706
Nothing.
Just, uh, meditating.

17:53.740 --> 17:54.807
Oh.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.075
What happened to your face?

17:56.109 --> 17:57.544
Oatmeal Boobs threw away
my makeup.

17:57.577 --> 17:58.645
Do you always look like that?

17:58.678 --> 18:01.080
Shut up. I was up all night
dancing the Charleston.

18:01.114 --> 18:02.382
The woman is awful.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.384
Tell me about it.
The colonel's ruining my life.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.752
What are you talking about?
The guy's a vegetable.

18:05.785 --> 18:09.656
He is a manipulative scumbag,
and he needs to be stopped.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.191
(doorbell rings)

18:11.224 --> 18:13.726
Just hear me out, okay?
'Cause I know that...
Oh, thank God you're here.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.396
You got to help us.
You left us alone
with an abusive lunatic.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.064
What happened to your face?

18:18.097 --> 18:19.065
Spooky, right?
Yeah.
(sighs)

18:19.098 --> 18:20.133
Are you gonna
help us or not?

18:20.167 --> 18:21.501
Uh...
(exhales)

18:21.534 --> 18:25.838
Guys, Alba and I got a pretty
sweet thing going on, so...

18:25.872 --> 18:26.406
Name your price.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.107
Well, you are family.

18:28.141 --> 18:29.976
So I guess
I'll have to take that

18:30.009 --> 18:31.911
into consideration.
Ugh.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.513
I'll come down to $4,200.

18:33.546 --> 18:35.248
Bizarrely specific
but fine.

18:35.282 --> 18:36.416
Okay, just get them
out of here,

18:36.449 --> 18:37.984
'cause if I have to scrub
the colonel's disgusting

18:38.017 --> 18:40.787
tattooed carcass one more time,
I'm gonna lose my mind.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.489
Guy's got tattoos, huh?
That's pretty sweet.

18:42.522 --> 18:45.258
He's got a cross, a dragonfly,
some weird poem about the sea...
Hold on a second.

18:45.292 --> 18:47.260
He has a dragonfly tattoo?

18:47.294 --> 18:49.429
Yeah. It's big.
It's right on his wrinkly tit.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.863
Right here?
Yeah.

18:50.897 --> 18:53.866
Oh, my God.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.603
Tippy. Hey, super sorry

18:56.636 --> 18:58.438
for the barge-in.
I'm Mickey. We spoke...

18:58.471 --> 19:00.173
I know who you are.
(blows) You're the sister

19:00.207 --> 19:02.542
of that whore who stole my son.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.511
Yeah. That's me.
So, listen,

19:04.544 --> 19:06.446
I know I told you
I needed you to watch the kids,

19:06.479 --> 19:08.147
but a couple things
fell through on my end,

19:08.181 --> 19:09.549
so we won't be
needing you anymore.

19:09.582 --> 19:11.984
Sorry for the inconvenience.
Hey, you know what?

19:12.018 --> 19:13.453
Grab a car
on your way out.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.121
Oh, I'm not going anywhere.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.789
Well, that's unfortunate.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.626
You leave me no choice
but to reveal a scandal

19:19.659 --> 19:22.995
so very scandalous

19:23.029 --> 19:24.897
that it will shatter
the foundation

19:24.931 --> 19:26.199
of the Pemberton name.

19:27.334 --> 19:28.668
That's right, Colonel.

19:28.701 --> 19:31.638
You've been a busy boy,
haven't you?

19:31.671 --> 19:32.805
A very bad,

19:32.839 --> 19:33.740
busy little boy.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.908
Now, we all know
the colonel is a man

19:35.942 --> 19:37.344
of many passions.

19:37.377 --> 19:40.913
But none burn brighter
than that of the female flesh.

19:40.947 --> 19:42.415
Even he was
no match

19:42.449 --> 19:45.017
for the temptresses
who inhabit the tiny

19:45.051 --> 19:47.654
island nation
of Guatemala!

19:47.687 --> 19:50.089
Guatemala isn't
an island.
Would you... I...

19:50.122 --> 19:52.325
I'm doing a thing.
I know. It's just
taking forever.

19:52.359 --> 19:53.893
I'm building up to something.
Build faster.

19:53.926 --> 19:54.627
Could you stop interrupting me?

19:54.661 --> 19:55.362
If you just do it...
Yeah, okay!

19:55.395 --> 19:56.062
Thank you!
Okay.

19:56.095 --> 19:58.197
Anyway...

19:58.231 --> 20:00.166
there's no denying
that the colonel has done

20:00.199 --> 20:04.103
a great many things for the
landlocked nation of Guatemala.

20:04.136 --> 20:08.207
His legacy will forever be
etched in the roads he's paved,

20:08.241 --> 20:09.576
the schools
he's built,

20:09.609 --> 20:12.912
and the faces
of his bastard children.

20:12.945 --> 20:14.046
That's right.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.515
The colonel
is Alba's father!

20:15.548 --> 20:17.350
Why else
would he have

20:17.384 --> 20:19.586
a dragonfly tattoo
over his heart,

20:19.619 --> 20:22.922
if not to honor
his precious libélula?

20:23.956 --> 20:25.292
What's the matter, Colonel?

20:25.325 --> 20:27.260
Cat got your tongue?

20:28.395 --> 20:30.397
I believe the,
uh, tattoo

20:30.430 --> 20:34.634
you're referring to
is the B-24 Bomber.

20:34.667 --> 20:38.371
Much like the one he
bravely flew over the Pacific.

20:38.405 --> 20:41.508
Yeah. Okay.
Well, um...

20:42.409 --> 20:45.077
Thank you for your service.

20:45.111 --> 20:47.547
You're no different
from your sister.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.549
You're just
a dimwitted gold digger

20:49.582 --> 20:52.652
trying to suckle
from the mighty Pemberton teat.

20:52.685 --> 20:56.889
Well, so long as I have breath
in my body, you will never...

20:56.923 --> 20:59.759
(crack)
(screams)

20:59.792 --> 21:01.260
(crying)

21:01.294 --> 21:03.396
Is she gonna be okay?
Yeah, yeah.

21:03.430 --> 21:04.664
Of course.

21:04.697 --> 21:08.301
Well, she did break both
of her hips, you know?

21:08.335 --> 21:11.070
So, no,
she's not.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.440
These kids have somebody
to watch them tonight?

21:16.042 --> 21:18.010
I mean, yeah,

21:18.044 --> 21:19.312
I guess I could stay,

21:19.346 --> 21:20.580
you know,

21:20.613 --> 21:22.181
if you guys need me.

21:22.214 --> 21:23.450
Yeah, if
you're not busy.

21:23.483 --> 21:25.452
Well, I am busy.
I'm very busy, Chip.

21:25.485 --> 21:27.354
That's not the question.
The question is,

21:27.387 --> 21:28.688
you know,
do you want me to stay?

21:28.721 --> 21:29.989
You know, I can,
if you're desperate.

21:30.022 --> 21:32.425
I mean, I wouldn't say
that we're desperate, but...

21:32.459 --> 21:33.426
yeah, I guess,

21:33.460 --> 21:34.961
technically,
we need somebody.

21:34.994 --> 21:36.195
Okay,
so if it's a technical issue,

21:36.228 --> 21:36.896
then, yeah,
Yeah.

21:36.929 --> 21:38.297
all right.
Eh, look at that.

21:38.331 --> 21:40.333
Sounds like we
all need each other.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.268
Who is he?

21:42.301 --> 21:44.170
I'm Jimmy.
I'm the boyfriend.

21:44.203 --> 21:46.105
No, he's not
my boyfriend.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.840
Come on, we've been plowing
for ten years.
All right, Jimmy, can we...?

21:47.874 --> 21:49.609
Come on, let's not do
this right now, okay?

21:49.642 --> 21:51.611
Come here, Ben. Let's get
you out of this thing

21:51.644 --> 21:53.880
before somebody
else gets hurt.

21:53.913 --> 21:55.782
You little murderer.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.350
Where's Alba?
