WEBVTT

00:03.149 --> 00:04.917
Sorry, kids, don't be upset,

00:04.951 --> 00:06.652
But I have to cancel
wizard class today.

00:06.686 --> 00:07.820
- Yay!
- Yes!

00:08.087 --> 00:09.388
Because you have so
many chores to do.

00:10.857 --> 00:14.126
Seriously, you have a
lot of chores to do.

00:14.160 --> 00:16.462
Oh, good. Recycling is on the list.

00:16.496 --> 00:21.266
Uh-uh-uh. And one of the best
things about recycling is...

00:21.301 --> 00:24.503
...You get to use it again.

00:24.537 --> 00:26.071
mother.

00:26.106 --> 00:28.407
You told us to never take
things out of the garbage.

00:28.441 --> 00:32.377
Food. And I was
talking to your dad.

00:32.412 --> 00:35.013
These kids do not know
how to eat a chicken leg.

00:35.048 --> 00:37.416
There's another side.

00:39.219 --> 00:43.489
Dad, you know I love chores
because alex hates them.

00:43.523 --> 00:45.457
But I can't do them today.

00:45.492 --> 00:48.527
I wanted to surprise you,
I'm gonna say it anyway,

00:48.561 --> 00:50.295
But I've been working
on my own spell

00:50.330 --> 00:53.365
For wizard certification. I am.

00:53.399 --> 00:56.068
Oh, please. Wizard certification?

00:56.102 --> 00:57.970
That sounds like something
people would make up

00:58.171 --> 00:59.538
Who aren't very good
at making things up.

01:01.107 --> 01:05.244
My son, justin vincenzo pepe russo.

01:05.278 --> 01:07.112
I've always wanted my own spell.

01:08.948 --> 01:11.884
Pepe. I can't get enough of that.

01:11.918 --> 01:15.187
It makes fun of itself. Pepe.

01:16.756 --> 01:18.924
This is so exciting.

01:18.958 --> 01:22.161
I want you to focus on the spell.

01:22.195 --> 01:25.731
Alex and max will
handle your chores.

01:26.766 --> 01:28.600
I can't do all these. Harper and I

01:28.635 --> 01:30.536
Are going to creature feature
confidential tonight.

01:30.803 --> 01:32.671
They project a scary movie
on a side of a building.

01:32.705 --> 01:34.106
Oh, cool. What movie?

01:34.274 --> 01:35.507
That's what makes it confidential.

01:35.942 --> 01:37.042
No one knows the
movie or the location

01:37.076 --> 01:38.177
Until you get the texts.

01:38.478 --> 01:39.678
Well, that's hardly more important

01:39.879 --> 01:42.915
Than justin creating
an original spell.

01:42.949 --> 01:44.816
Thank you, dad.

01:44.851 --> 01:47.586
Oh, and alex,
when you vacuum the rug,

01:47.620 --> 01:49.688
Try to leave a vertical
light/dark pattern.

01:49.722 --> 01:51.657
Mom loves that.

01:51.691 --> 01:53.225
I really do.

01:56.596 --> 01:58.664
* well, you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *

01:58.998 --> 02:00.632
* that the end will no
doubt justify the means *

02:01.201 --> 02:02.768
* you can fix any problem
with the slightest of ease *

02:02.802 --> 02:04.403
* yes, please *

02:04.437 --> 02:06.238
* but you might find out
it'll go to your head *

02:06.839 --> 02:07.873
* when you write a report
on a book you never read *

02:08.775 --> 02:10.375
* with the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *

02:10.410 --> 02:12.211
* that's what I said *

02:12.245 --> 02:15.314
* everything is not what it seems *

02:15.348 --> 02:19.184
* you can get all you wanted
in your wildest dreams *

02:19.219 --> 02:22.754
* you might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *

02:22.789 --> 02:27.626
* because everything
is not what it seems *

02:27.660 --> 02:30.762
* everything is not what it seems *

02:30.797 --> 02:34.566
* when you can have what you
want by the simplest of means *

02:34.601 --> 02:38.403
* be careful not to mess
with the balance of things *

02:38.438 --> 02:42.274
* because everything is not *

02:42.308 --> 02:44.843
* what it seems *

02:44.844 --> 02:50.844
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

02:51.317 --> 02:54.052
Wow. Justin, I'm proud of you.

02:54.087 --> 02:58.056
Your new spell will make the
russo name live on forever.

02:58.091 --> 02:59.858
Thought you said the russo
name would live on because all

03:00.493 --> 03:03.328
- The grandchildren you'd have.
- Yeah, that'd be nice.

03:03.363 --> 03:05.330
A spell would be great though.

03:05.365 --> 03:08.400
Ok, I think it's ready.

03:08.434 --> 03:10.002
Stand back.

03:10.036 --> 03:13.872
X, x, extra hand take a stand

03:13.906 --> 03:16.608
Give us a hand!

03:16.643 --> 03:19.544
Lightning. It's alive!

03:19.579 --> 03:21.079
It's alive!

03:24.384 --> 03:26.785
Your new spell is a woman's hand?

03:26.819 --> 03:28.787
I can't wait for the grandchildren.

03:28.821 --> 03:30.656
dad, check it out.

03:30.690 --> 03:32.991
You know how you need an
extra hand around the house?

03:33.026 --> 03:36.094
Ok, so you made an extra hand!
What's it do?

03:36.129 --> 03:37.696
It does all kinds of things.

03:38.064 --> 03:40.732
Pretend you're a busy wizard
who needs help with something.

03:40.767 --> 03:43.201
All right. Uh...

03:43.236 --> 03:47.372
I could use a back scratch,
but because I'm so busy

03:47.407 --> 03:49.308
Casting spells with
these hands, I'm...

03:49.509 --> 03:52.377
No, wait. I'm painting.
I'm painting with both hands.

03:52.412 --> 03:54.946
No, I know. I'm trapped in a box.

03:54.981 --> 03:56.815
I've always wanted to do this.

03:56.849 --> 03:58.617
Dad.

04:00.086 --> 04:02.054
Hand, do your thing.

04:06.326 --> 04:08.860
Ooh. Oh. Little down.

04:08.895 --> 04:10.729
Left. Left.

04:10.763 --> 04:12.564
Little down more. Down.

04:12.598 --> 04:13.765
In... It's...

04:13.800 --> 04:16.134
Over... that tickles.

04:16.168 --> 04:18.704
The other way. Oh, right there. Ah!

04:18.738 --> 04:19.771
Wow!

04:21.474 --> 04:24.142
That was awesome. Thank you, hand.

04:24.177 --> 04:26.745
Plus, it will tie your shoes,
iron your clothes,

04:26.779 --> 04:29.247
Find your glasses,
and it's cpr certified,

04:29.282 --> 04:30.982
Especially since medical
authorities agree

04:31.250 --> 04:32.918
That you don't need
to use mouth-to-mouth.

04:35.088 --> 04:38.190
Awesome work, justin,
especially on the cpr thing.

04:38.224 --> 04:41.193
You know what? We should write
to the superintendent of spells

04:41.227 --> 04:43.195
- And get this certified.
- Yes.

04:43.229 --> 04:44.296
Hand!

04:45.698 --> 04:47.132
too slow.

04:47.166 --> 04:49.167
Nice one.

04:49.202 --> 04:51.536
Even the things I
create do that to me.

04:52.905 --> 04:54.339
Oh, no, I'm not falling for that.

04:55.475 --> 04:56.875
Son.

05:02.181 --> 05:04.750
You know who I think is really hot?

05:04.784 --> 05:07.018
The guy who invented paper plates.

05:07.053 --> 05:09.454
Look on the bright side, alex.

05:09.489 --> 05:11.790
After this, all you've got
to do is mop the floors,

05:11.891 --> 05:13.725
Clean your room, wash the windows,
scrub the restaurant,

05:14.193 --> 05:15.560
And then you can go to the
creature feature movie.

05:17.764 --> 05:21.233
We're not going to
the movie, are we?

05:21.267 --> 05:24.269
Not unless you help me
break some of these dishes.

05:24.303 --> 05:26.638
Hey, that's a good idea.

05:26.672 --> 05:28.206
Alex.

05:36.349 --> 05:37.949
There's a hand on
your dad's shoulder

05:37.984 --> 05:39.785
And it's not connected to a body.

05:39.819 --> 05:41.753
I'm not sure whether I
should scream or laugh,

05:41.788 --> 05:43.455
So I'm going to do
both at the same time.

05:51.197 --> 05:52.998
You know, dad, normally,

05:53.032 --> 05:55.333
I'd say something to get
out of work right now,

05:55.368 --> 05:58.403
But that hand on your shoulder
is kinda freaking me out.

05:58.438 --> 06:01.473
This is justin's spell.
It's called helping hand.

06:01.507 --> 06:04.075
- Will it slap him?
- No.

06:04.110 --> 06:06.445
Well, then it's no help to me.

06:06.479 --> 06:10.415
I designed it to lend a
helping hand to busy wizards.

06:10.450 --> 06:12.150
I'm so proud of you, justin.

06:12.485 --> 06:15.620
This spell is going to put the
russo name on the wizard map.

06:15.655 --> 06:19.257
I've got something that'll put
our name on the wizard map.

06:20.760 --> 06:24.162
Ok. How about a spell
to make clear plastic

06:24.197 --> 06:26.798
That's sticky on one
side and it helps wizards

06:26.833 --> 06:29.534
Put drawings on the refrigerator.

06:30.937 --> 06:35.273
I'll call it russo's sticky strips.

06:35.308 --> 06:38.643
You know, that sounds
vaguely similar to something

06:38.678 --> 06:41.413
That we have right
here called tape.

06:44.383 --> 06:46.084
Oh, man.

06:46.118 --> 06:48.086
This is even better than mine.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.922
It has a convenient, clear holder

06:50.957 --> 06:53.625
And a serrated edge for clean cuts.

06:56.429 --> 06:58.430
All right. I got to prepare
for my presentation

06:58.464 --> 07:00.065
For the superintendent of spells.

07:00.199 --> 07:01.800
- Gotta iron the shirt.
- No, no, son.

07:01.834 --> 07:03.201
You're too busy for that.

07:03.503 --> 07:06.671
Alex, add "iron justin's
shirt" to your list.

07:07.406 --> 07:08.740
Ok.

07:11.377 --> 07:14.579
"burn justin's shirt."

07:14.614 --> 07:16.448
Look, I'll help you and maybe

07:16.482 --> 07:18.083
We can get the work done
in time for the movie.

07:18.784 --> 07:21.353
That sounds like a good idea if
it wasn't for the "work" part.

07:21.387 --> 07:25.924
If only we had a box

07:25.958 --> 07:31.463
That contained a hand
that liked to work.

07:31.497 --> 07:34.866
I thought of that, but I was hoping

07:34.901 --> 07:37.636
You wouldn't get there because,
you know, it's just trouble.

07:45.077 --> 07:48.980
Harper, don't you ever hold
back another devious idea again.

07:49.015 --> 07:51.182
You're good at it and you
need to start owning it.

07:56.722 --> 08:00.325
Wow, alex, I've never
seen your room so clean.

08:00.359 --> 08:02.360
I didn't even know you had a desk.

08:03.162 --> 08:05.564
That's a desk?

08:07.099 --> 08:09.067
All right, nice work, hand.

08:09.101 --> 08:11.670
I couldn't have done
it better myself.

08:11.704 --> 08:13.371
Probably because you wouldn't have.

08:13.406 --> 08:14.940
Yeah, you got that right.

08:16.576 --> 08:18.677
It's the creature feature text!

08:18.945 --> 08:21.813
We are going to see night of the
Halloween sorority party disaster 3.

08:21.847 --> 08:23.748
Awesome. I heard it's
so scary that they have

08:24.016 --> 08:26.184
To have emergency medical
technicians standing by.

08:26.218 --> 08:29.354
Now all we need is the location
text and we're good to go.

08:31.824 --> 08:34.726
Whoa. What do you
think you're doing?

08:34.760 --> 08:36.794
You're not done.
You've barely started.

08:36.929 --> 08:39.063
So roll up your sleeves and
give it some elbow grease.

08:39.097 --> 08:41.198
Oh, wait. You don't
have sleeves or elbows.

08:42.201 --> 08:43.702
Nope, nope.

08:43.736 --> 08:46.371
Stop it. You are not... Ow!

08:46.405 --> 08:49.441
You're finishing the chores.

08:51.410 --> 08:56.548
Alex, it's ok. She did a lot.

08:56.582 --> 08:58.216
You and I might be able
to finish the rest.

08:58.417 --> 09:00.318
Don't make the freaky hand upset.

09:00.353 --> 09:02.787
No. She's got to finish my chores

09:02.822 --> 09:04.022
Or we don't get to go to the movie.

09:04.590 --> 09:06.391
Then I don't think
we're going. Look.

09:13.633 --> 09:17.102
And I was going to get you a
manicure when you were done!

09:17.136 --> 09:19.204
You said you were gonna make
her give you a manicure.

09:19.238 --> 09:20.372
Shh.

09:25.965 --> 09:27.099
hey, maxy.

09:29.068 --> 09:33.705
You're not making an antenna to
talk to martians again, are you?

09:33.740 --> 09:35.374
We're wizards.

09:35.408 --> 09:38.310
Why does everyone think it's
crazy that there's martians?

09:42.148 --> 09:44.049
Oh, watch.

09:45.885 --> 09:49.354
Dad, don't you just hate it
when your back starts to itch

09:49.389 --> 09:50.922
While you're brushing your teeth?

09:50.957 --> 09:52.591
Huh? No.

09:52.625 --> 09:54.726
How are your chores going?

09:54.761 --> 09:58.897
Then let me introduce you to
my brand new magical invention:

09:58.931 --> 10:01.767
The russo tooth and back brush.

10:01.801 --> 10:04.269
See, you can brush your teeth

10:04.303 --> 10:07.806
And scratch your back
at the same time.

10:07.840 --> 10:11.276
Max, that's not a
magical invention.

10:11.310 --> 10:14.312
Dad, come on. You know when
you scratch a good itch,

10:14.347 --> 10:17.115
It's pretty magical.

10:17.150 --> 10:20.185
Hey, is that my back scratcher

10:20.219 --> 10:22.187
I keep between my
mattress and box spring?

10:22.355 --> 10:24.689
I need this for when your
mom pretends to be asleep

10:24.724 --> 10:26.358
And won't scratch my back.

10:26.492 --> 10:28.660
Well, I would, honey,
if you'd return the favor,

10:28.694 --> 10:32.164
But you're all like... Done.

10:32.198 --> 10:35.901
You know what, I'm gonna come
up with something really good.

10:35.935 --> 10:36.968
You'll see.

10:38.000 --> 10:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:53.453 --> 10:56.188
Ex, do you think we're really
going to catch the hand this way?

10:56.222 --> 10:57.923
Of course we are. It's a hand.

10:57.957 --> 10:59.291
It's a total knucklehead.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.793
get it? It's not...

11:04.897 --> 11:06.598
It's the location text.

11:06.632 --> 11:08.667
We're gonna see the movie
on the flat iron building.

11:08.768 --> 11:10.535
We've gotta finish
cleaning this place up.

11:10.870 --> 11:13.605
- We haven't caught the hand.
- Or done the chores.

11:13.639 --> 11:15.574
Why do you make it so hard
to take the easy way out?

11:16.042 --> 11:17.609
Alex, why do you make taking
the easy way out so hard.

11:17.910 --> 11:20.011
'cause I like the easy way out.
Shh, there it is.

11:46.339 --> 11:47.939
This thing is strong.

11:47.974 --> 11:50.175
Let's just put it back in the box,

11:50.209 --> 11:51.843
Finish cleaning,
and go to the movie.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.144
No way. Forget that.

11:53.412 --> 11:55.180
This hand is gonna
finish what it started.

11:58.317 --> 11:59.918
You stop it.

12:00.786 --> 12:02.153
Oh. Oh?

12:02.188 --> 12:04.656
Oh, so you don't do windows?
We'll see about that.

12:07.360 --> 12:10.128
Ha. Who's cleaning now?

12:11.931 --> 12:14.966
The hand, that's who.

12:22.041 --> 12:23.141
Ha.

12:28.180 --> 12:30.482
Alex, aren't you
doing all the work?

12:30.516 --> 12:33.184
No. I'm working hard to make
sure the hand does all the work.

12:33.219 --> 12:34.386
Duh!

12:36.589 --> 12:39.758
Are you sure you're not
doing all the work?

12:39.792 --> 12:42.928
Harper, what are you not getting?
Don't you see her?

12:51.003 --> 12:52.904
That's everything on the list.

12:52.939 --> 12:56.007
I think it's tired. Fine.
I'm done with you.

13:02.081 --> 13:04.950
Justin isn't. He needs the
hand for his presentation.

13:04.984 --> 13:07.852
It'll be okay. I'll just
put it back in its box,

13:07.887 --> 13:10.088
She'll get some rest and
we can get to our movie.

13:15.461 --> 13:16.828
wow.

13:17.997 --> 13:20.832
Alex, this place is spotless.

13:22.201 --> 13:23.702
Did harper help you?

13:23.736 --> 13:26.004
Why does everyone find
it so hard to believe

13:26.038 --> 13:28.039
That I did this all by myself?

13:28.074 --> 13:31.810
You see, doesn't it feel
good to do all your chores?

13:31.844 --> 13:33.812
Have fun at your movie.

13:38.384 --> 13:40.652
Alex, you better put that
thing back in the box.

13:40.686 --> 13:43.855
Where is it? It was right
here on the counter.

13:43.889 --> 13:45.824
Justin must have taken it back

13:45.858 --> 13:47.525
Into the lair for his presentation.

13:47.893 --> 13:50.161
Then how are you supposed
to get it back in the box?

13:52.264 --> 13:54.899
I have an idea.

14:00.773 --> 14:03.608
okay, justin, let's go
through your presentation

14:03.643 --> 14:06.478
One more time before the
superintendent gets here.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.181
You seem a little nervous.

14:11.450 --> 14:13.051
Are you sure it's not you?

14:13.085 --> 14:16.121
Oh, I am. You're right.

14:16.155 --> 14:17.989
- I feel faint.
- Ok, sit down.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.724
Let's take a seat.
Breathe. Breathe.

14:19.759 --> 14:21.226
No, it's ok. I'm all right, son.

14:21.260 --> 14:22.794
You, you go ahead.

14:22.828 --> 14:24.863
alex, are you done
with your chores?

14:25.097 --> 14:27.165
Uh, yeah, just one more thing
I need to take care of.

14:27.199 --> 14:29.034
Well, we're busy rehearsing.
Get out.

14:29.235 --> 14:31.603
Oh, let me hear it.
Maybe I can give you a hand.

14:33.839 --> 14:35.807
Ok, fine.

14:35.841 --> 14:38.977
I created helping hand for
wizards who like to multi-task.

14:41.814 --> 14:43.982
So, with helping hand you
can do a number of things

14:44.016 --> 14:45.583
At the same time.

14:46.786 --> 14:48.953
Alex, are you all right?

14:48.988 --> 14:50.789
Yeah, my hand just fell asleep.

14:56.996 --> 14:58.997
The superintendent's here.

15:00.366 --> 15:02.133
All right. Well, good luck.

15:02.301 --> 15:04.202
I'm off to the movie you said
I could go to when I'm done

15:04.303 --> 15:05.437
And I'm done,
so I'm off to the movie.

15:05.471 --> 15:06.771
Oh, alex. No.

15:07.006 --> 15:09.240
Your brother could use an audience.
You have to stay.

15:09.275 --> 15:11.242
You can help with some "
oohs" and "ahhs."

15:11.277 --> 15:13.645
But the movie's about to start.

15:13.679 --> 15:15.914
Alex, your brother needs you.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.587
Ok, uh. "russo, justin."

15:22.621 --> 15:24.589
- Yes.
- You're next.

15:26.158 --> 15:27.559
- Shall we?
- Come on in.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.428
Uh, superintendent spellman,
may I offer you

15:30.463 --> 15:33.732
A selection of meats
from around the world?

15:33.766 --> 15:37.001
Are you trying to bribe me with meat
that's sweating more than you are?

15:38.504 --> 15:39.637
Let's get started.

15:41.507 --> 15:44.209
Ooh. Ahh.

15:44.243 --> 15:47.345
Alex, you have to wait
for the presentation.

15:48.347 --> 15:50.415
Man, my dogs are tired.

15:50.449 --> 15:52.217
I've got to air these puppies out.

15:52.651 --> 15:55.353
I can't do this at the office
or I have to fill out a form.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.590
Ok, let's get to it.

15:58.624 --> 16:01.259
- Uh, yes, let's get to it.
- Right away, sir.

16:02.695 --> 16:04.162
Who wants iced tea?

16:04.196 --> 16:06.798
I'd love some iced tea.

16:06.832 --> 16:08.433
Oh, great.

16:14.840 --> 16:17.575
Tastes like somebody
washed their hands in this.

16:19.845 --> 16:21.646
Oh.

16:25.584 --> 16:27.685
I'm really thirsty.

16:27.720 --> 16:30.555
Ok, here we go.

16:30.589 --> 16:35.326
I created the helping hand for
wizards who like to multi-task.

16:35.361 --> 16:37.228
Ooh.

16:37.263 --> 16:39.030
so...

16:39.064 --> 16:41.699
You're answering your
wand phone with one hand,

16:41.734 --> 16:43.701
While battling a
dragon with the other.

16:43.736 --> 16:46.204
Then suddenly your feet get tired.

16:46.238 --> 16:48.540
No problem for the helping hand.

16:48.574 --> 16:50.675
How about a foot rub?

16:59.084 --> 17:00.552
Foot rub.

17:00.586 --> 17:03.121
no problem for helping hand.

17:06.224 --> 17:10.295
I said, "no problem
for the helping hand."

17:11.964 --> 17:13.198
I haven't got a lot of time.

17:13.665 --> 17:14.933
Either your spell
works or it doesn't.

17:14.967 --> 17:16.501
Oh, no, it works, I've seen it.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.703
Wake up! Rub his feet.

17:18.737 --> 17:23.741
Um. I know, why don't I
just get it started here.

17:25.845 --> 17:28.746
Ooh. Ahh.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.750
Come on, you're supposed
to be helping people.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.292
A spell with an attitude?

17:41.760 --> 17:43.895
I might be able to overlook it,
if it actually worked.

17:54.206 --> 17:55.473
Ow!

17:56.709 --> 17:59.310
This is not looking
good for you guys.

17:59.879 --> 18:01.613
Sorry.

18:01.647 --> 18:03.514
Bad, bad.

18:03.549 --> 18:08.453
Introducing the cooperative foot.

18:09.221 --> 18:11.322
Really? Now?

18:11.357 --> 18:14.525
I can't believe I'm about to say
this but alex, do something.

18:14.560 --> 18:19.063
If you ever feel like kicking
something but you're too tired?

18:21.367 --> 18:24.636
Jerry! What are you doing?
He just wants your attention.

18:24.670 --> 18:29.140
Oh, I'm sorry. Alex, zap him back.

18:29.174 --> 18:31.175
In about a half an hour.

18:36.615 --> 18:38.483
We have to leave for
the movie right now.

18:38.517 --> 18:40.351
We'll end up sitting in the bushes

18:40.386 --> 18:42.220
Looking up from the
bottom of the wall.

18:42.254 --> 18:43.688
I know, I'm trying.

18:44.056 --> 18:46.324
We need to wait for a little
more chaos and we can sneak out.

18:54.833 --> 18:59.370
Uh, superintendent spellman,
I am so sorry.

18:59.405 --> 19:00.939
I had no idea that any
of this would happen.

19:01.106 --> 19:02.707
This morning, the hand was...

19:02.741 --> 19:05.043
- ...So helpful.
- Just give my son a minute.

19:05.077 --> 19:06.945
I'm sure we'll be
able to work this out.

19:07.212 --> 19:11.983
Ok, I'm backing out.
I'm backing out. And I'm out!

19:14.486 --> 19:16.554
You can't leave justin like this.

19:16.588 --> 19:18.556
He created the helping
hand to help others,

19:18.590 --> 19:20.291
But instead you
used it to help you.

19:20.459 --> 19:22.527
- Don't you feel responsible?
- Don't you?

19:22.561 --> 19:25.263
You're my best friend.
You know I'm up to no good

19:25.297 --> 19:28.132
All the time. You should
be ashamed of yourself.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.501
- Alex.
- Harper.

19:31.870 --> 19:34.872
Oh, I hate it when you're right.

19:34.907 --> 19:37.675
Excuse me, don't go anywhere.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.544
I just need a moment
with the helping hand.

19:39.578 --> 19:41.846
Alex, what are you doing?
It's over.

19:41.880 --> 19:44.849
Fixing something. The kind of
thing you told me not to tell you

19:44.883 --> 19:48.019
Because you don't want to get involved
and then... I'll be right back.

20:00.065 --> 20:03.401
Look, hand. My brother
worked really hard on you.

20:03.435 --> 20:05.636
Just because I don't enjoy
hard work doesn't mean

20:05.671 --> 20:07.672
I don't appreciate
it when I see it.

20:13.612 --> 20:15.246
Besides, you're mad at me.

20:15.581 --> 20:17.715
Don't hate him because you hate me,
we're nothing alike.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.384
Believe me.

20:19.418 --> 20:21.419
Please do this for justin.

20:21.453 --> 20:24.088
And for me. Oh!

20:24.923 --> 20:27.392
Ok, fine. Only for justin.

20:45.277 --> 20:50.415
- And we are back on track.
- Hand, do your thing.

20:52.151 --> 20:53.785
Oh! Oh! Yeah, down.

20:53.819 --> 20:56.421
Down, down. Oh! Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

20:56.455 --> 20:57.955
Oh, ooh, ooh, right there.

20:58.357 --> 21:01.492
Right there. Right there.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Yeah, oh.

21:01.527 --> 21:03.261
Mama.

21:05.064 --> 21:07.065
Do you mind if I show
this to the board?

21:07.533 --> 21:10.635
They're always looking for a good back
scratcher at the wizard gift shop.

21:18.744 --> 21:21.579
Whoa. Oh, that was crazy.

21:21.613 --> 21:24.782
I sold the foot,
made a fortune, lost it,

21:24.817 --> 21:27.318
Brought a hundred-year-old
man from india back to life,

21:27.352 --> 21:28.419
And got a new nickname.

21:30.889 --> 21:32.957
Anyway, I'm gonna go to bed.

21:32.991 --> 21:34.692
Wait, max.

21:34.726 --> 21:37.161
Listen, you know I'm
proud of you too, right?

21:37.196 --> 21:40.131
Dad, I know.
The man from india told me.

21:40.165 --> 21:43.768
He also said that one day humans
are gonna have gills again.

21:43.802 --> 21:45.736
Can't wait!

21:47.573 --> 21:49.507
Gills.

21:49.541 --> 21:52.944
He makes it so hard to be proud.

21:56.478 --> 21:59.046
You know, I never thought
I'd say this but,

21:59.147 --> 22:03.300
Night of the Halloween sorority party
disaster 3 was better than one or two.
