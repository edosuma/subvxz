WEBVTT

00:05.136 --> 00:06.607
What a crazy day.

00:06.607 --> 00:08.409
Ellen spent
the entire afternoon

00:08.409 --> 00:11.182
trying to get over
her fear of cartwheels.

00:11.182 --> 00:13.784
Okay.
Here I go.

00:13.784 --> 00:15.186
I can't, I can't.

00:16.787 --> 00:19.050
Rocked myself seasick.
I'm gonna need a minute.

00:20.391 --> 00:23.124
I'm gonna die!
But not today.

00:24.695 --> 00:26.397
It went on all day,

00:26.397 --> 00:28.699
and I couldn't
take my eyes off it.

00:28.699 --> 00:31.402
I missed all my naps.
I'm exhausted.

00:33.204 --> 00:36.337
Stan,
do you write a blog?

00:38.209 --> 00:40.411
Uh...

00:59.260 --> 01:02.293
Uh...

01:02.293 --> 01:05.136
Stan,
you're writing a blog.
No, no, I'm not.

01:05.136 --> 01:07.268
It's-- It's-- It's notes
for a screenplay.

01:07.268 --> 01:10.101
Oh, really? Then what's
this screenplay about?

01:10.101 --> 01:13.304
A dog who writes a blog.
( exclaims )

01:13.304 --> 01:16.507
I mean, a dog who has
magical adventures

01:16.507 --> 01:18.749
while saving the world
from demons

01:18.749 --> 01:20.451
whose spore was planted

01:20.451 --> 01:22.253
beneath the earth's crust
eons ago.

01:22.253 --> 01:24.755
And then writes
a blog about it. Ay!

01:25.786 --> 01:28.789
I would so see that movie.

01:28.789 --> 01:31.122
I mean, Stan,
you write a blog?

01:33.264 --> 01:35.296
TYLER: He's been writing
about everything

01:35.296 --> 01:37.498
that's happened in our family
for the last 2 years.

01:37.498 --> 01:41.332
Okay. Yes.
I started blogging hoping to
reach other talking animals,

01:41.332 --> 01:43.134
but there
don't seem to be any.

01:43.134 --> 01:44.535
But a few people read it,

01:44.535 --> 01:46.707
and think I'm a person
pretending to be a dog.

01:46.707 --> 01:49.510
Assuming those
readers are people.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.482
The guy whose screen name
is Charlie the Bandit

01:51.482 --> 01:53.514
sounds awfully raccoony.

01:54.785 --> 01:56.417
Stan,
you've written about

01:56.417 --> 01:58.589
some really
embarrassing things here.

01:58.589 --> 02:00.621
The time I made a fool
of myself over Wes.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.523
The time I made a fool
of myself over Nikki.

02:02.523 --> 02:05.125
The other time I made
a fool of myself over Wes.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.897
The other time I made
a fool of myself over Nikki.

02:06.897 --> 02:08.659
The other, other time
I made a fool--

02:08.659 --> 02:10.331
Wow, it is a miracle
either of us ever dated.

02:12.233 --> 02:14.134
I think it's cool how you
wrote about the time

02:14.134 --> 02:17.838
I said,
"I'm a mountain man."

02:17.838 --> 02:21.712
Or the time I said,
"I'm Mrs. Grimmens."

02:23.143 --> 02:25.716
Or the time I said,
"Eat your soup!"

02:25.716 --> 02:28.849
I never realized I spoke
so many different languages.

02:28.849 --> 02:32.323
Stan, I don't want you
writing about us anymore.

02:32.323 --> 02:35.326
I was afraid of this.
It's why I kept it a secret.

02:35.326 --> 02:38.489
You can write about me.
I'll do something else
adorable.

02:38.489 --> 02:41.832
I wuv pa-sghetti.

02:41.832 --> 02:43.264
Come on!
If I were anymore adorable,

02:43.264 --> 02:46.837
I'd fart a rainbow
and fly out of the room.

02:46.837 --> 02:51.602
That wouldn't be adorable.
That'd be magical.

02:51.602 --> 02:54.745
Either way,
you'd be blogging about it.

02:54.745 --> 02:57.548
I'm serious, Stan.
No more blogging.

02:57.548 --> 03:00.851
What if someone
I know found this?
People think I'm cool.

03:00.851 --> 03:03.954
I could live with it
if they stop thinking that,
but could they?

03:03.954 --> 03:05.586
In these crazy times
we live in,

03:05.586 --> 03:08.919
don't they deserve
something to believe in?

03:08.919 --> 03:11.262
Not to mention
all the embarrassing stories

03:11.262 --> 03:12.663
in here
about Mom and Dad.

03:12.663 --> 03:15.326
BENNETT:
Ellen, it's harvest time.

03:15.326 --> 03:18.829
Like the fact that
Mom shaves Dad's back hair.

03:18.829 --> 03:22.333
Guys, this blog means
everything to me.

03:22.333 --> 03:23.804
It's the one thing I have

03:23.804 --> 03:25.406
where I can really
express myself

03:25.406 --> 03:28.239
to the outside world
and be who I am.

03:28.239 --> 03:30.741
Please, don't ask me
to give that up.

03:30.741 --> 03:32.943
Well, as long as
no one thinks

03:32.943 --> 03:34.815
you're a talking dog,

03:34.815 --> 03:37.848
I guess I'm okay with it.
What do you say, Tyler?

03:37.848 --> 03:39.590
Well, I guess
I do care more about Stan

03:39.590 --> 03:41.252
than about the people
whose lives

03:41.252 --> 03:43.694
will be shattered
when they see I have flaws.

03:43.694 --> 03:47.328
Yes, Tyler.
It's the end of Camelot.

03:47.328 --> 03:49.260
The fact that I don't get that
is not one of my flaws.

03:49.260 --> 03:50.961
The fact that you said it
is one of yours.

03:52.363 --> 03:53.834
Put that in, Stan.

03:55.306 --> 03:57.468
I'll tell you what he should
put in his next blog.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.312
Does anyone see
a rainbow behind me?

04:06.246 --> 04:07.548
Well, my book is done.

04:07.548 --> 04:09.880
Got it right here
on this flash drive.

04:09.880 --> 04:11.552
Oh, the book
on blended families

04:11.552 --> 04:12.983
that you didn't
want my help with.

04:12.983 --> 04:14.855
Pardon me
for not doing cartwheels,

04:14.855 --> 04:17.558
which I can do, by the way,
not the least bit afraid.

04:17.558 --> 04:21.692
Aah!
I have nothing
to prove here.

04:23.364 --> 04:25.996
Actually I have
a little surprise, Ellen.

04:25.996 --> 04:28.569
I did use
many of your suggestions,

04:28.569 --> 04:31.372
especially the jokes,
and I am going to give you

04:31.372 --> 04:33.374
a credit
on the book cover.

04:33.374 --> 04:36.377
"Additional material
by Ellen Jennings."

04:36.377 --> 04:39.550
Bennett,
you used my jokes?

04:39.550 --> 04:41.982
Additional
material by--

04:41.982 --> 04:44.355
I'm actually getting
an AMB credit.

04:44.355 --> 04:46.387
That's what
they call it, right?
Nobody ever calls it that.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.018
They'll start to.
It's funny.

04:48.018 --> 04:50.391
I'm not sure
what's funny about it.

04:50.391 --> 04:52.863
Oh, please.
Who's the professional
comedy writer here?

04:52.863 --> 04:54.665
So when will
that book get published?

04:54.665 --> 04:56.397
Will there be a party?
What should I wear?

04:56.397 --> 04:57.668
Something
that says authoress

04:57.668 --> 04:59.330
or something
that says comedienne?

04:59.330 --> 05:02.032
Maybe funny pants
and a serious top.

05:02.032 --> 05:04.775
Okay, let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

05:04.775 --> 05:06.577
My editor Barry
has to like it first.

05:06.577 --> 05:09.480
You understand he's
kind of like my boss, right?

05:09.480 --> 05:11.942
Our boss, Bennett.
We're a team now.

05:11.942 --> 05:14.515
You need me.
There aren't a lot of
additional material

05:14.515 --> 05:17.017
artists out there.
That's what they call us.

05:17.017 --> 05:19.049
No, they-- Never mind.

05:19.049 --> 05:20.951
I gotta tell you,
honey,

05:20.951 --> 05:22.753
I am not looking
forward to his feedback.

05:22.753 --> 05:24.825
I really should
get a different editor.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.557
He can be
pretty annoying,

05:26.557 --> 05:28.999
and not just
his nitpicky notes.

05:28.999 --> 05:30.961
When we go out for lunch,
he gets so excited,

05:30.961 --> 05:32.763
he spits when he eats.

05:34.465 --> 05:38.108
Bennett, I can't wait
to talk about your book--

05:38.108 --> 05:40.511
And this is just crackers.

05:40.511 --> 05:43.574
In our last lunch,
he was mouth-firing
chicken cacciatore at me.

05:45.646 --> 05:48.679
Does Barry
throw his dirty socks
on the floor, too?

05:48.679 --> 05:52.352
'Cause that would make him
the total package.

05:55.386 --> 05:57.087
What happened here?

05:57.087 --> 06:00.531
Someone's clothes
are on backwards.

06:02.132 --> 06:05.035
That Chloe,
what will she do next?

06:05.035 --> 06:07.698
That should get me into
Stan's blog, right?

06:07.698 --> 06:09.470
I don't know
about Stan's blog,

06:09.470 --> 06:12.042
but it could get you
into mine.
You have a blog?

06:12.042 --> 06:14.374
Stan inspired me.
So today I started a blog.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.046
Here's my first post.

06:16.046 --> 06:18.148
"Today I started a blog."

06:21.011 --> 06:22.853
I'm keeping it real.
I think my audience
will like that.

06:22.853 --> 06:24.655
Yeah.

06:24.655 --> 06:26.487
Tyler, I read your blog.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.859
I love
how you're keeping it real.

06:30.921 --> 06:34.665
Tyler, everybody at school
loves your blog.

06:34.665 --> 06:36.066
I don't get it.

06:36.066 --> 06:37.998
All you wrote is,
"Today I started a blog."

06:37.998 --> 06:40.731
And, "Hey."
Hey.

06:40.731 --> 06:43.073
Well, when you say it that way,
I can see the appeal.

06:44.635 --> 06:46.106
Guys,
I'm glad you're all here.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.838
I heard your dad
talking about his book

06:47.838 --> 06:49.109
and it got me thinking.

06:49.109 --> 06:51.812
I could publish
my blog as a book.

06:51.812 --> 06:54.114
How amazing would that be?

06:54.114 --> 06:57.147
I put it on this flash drive
to send to your dad's editor.

06:57.147 --> 07:00.420
Stan, you can't publish
your blog as a book.

07:00.420 --> 07:04.054
Not before you write about
the backwards-dressing girl.

07:04.054 --> 07:08.599
Zipper in the back,
snacks in the hood.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.563
No. No books about
you as a talking dog.

07:12.563 --> 07:14.605
We need to keep that secret,
remember?

07:14.605 --> 07:16.667
We could just say
that you wrote it.

07:16.667 --> 07:19.109
The people reading it
online think it was
written by a person.

07:19.109 --> 07:23.213
Sure. That may fool most people,
but what about Mom and Dad?

07:23.213 --> 07:25.776
If they read this,
they'll see that
there's things on there

07:25.776 --> 07:27.117
only you could know.

07:27.117 --> 07:28.949
Yeah, like when they
talk to you on Halloween,

07:28.949 --> 07:31.722
or when Mom spent all day
trying to do cartwheels,

07:31.722 --> 07:33.654
you were
the only one there.

07:33.654 --> 07:36.126
And a hundred other things
that seemed weird at the time

07:36.126 --> 07:37.728
that they'll piece together,

07:37.728 --> 07:40.230
and realize
that you really talk.

07:40.230 --> 07:41.592
And that you think
your stuffed monkey talks,

07:41.592 --> 07:44.795
which is a whole
other level of weird.

07:44.795 --> 07:46.096
You'll think it's less weird
when he gives you

07:46.096 --> 07:48.068
your favorite muffin.

07:48.068 --> 07:51.201
It's a banana nut
from a banana nut.

07:51.201 --> 07:55.145
( laughing )

07:55.145 --> 07:58.749
I told you
that wasn't funny, Robert.

07:58.749 --> 08:00.210
The point is
it's too risky

08:00.210 --> 08:02.152
for your blog
to become a book.

08:02.152 --> 08:03.654
Wow, I guess
I didn't think it through.

08:03.654 --> 08:05.656
Good thing
I didn't send this in.

08:05.656 --> 08:08.188
Let's delete it before
anything bad happens.

08:08.188 --> 08:09.690
Are you gonna
eat that muffin?

08:09.690 --> 08:11.692
The one the dog gave
to the stuffed monkey?

08:11.692 --> 08:12.863
No, I don't think
that's going anywhere

08:12.863 --> 08:14.995
near my mouth.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.127
I'll just hood it
for later.

08:19.069 --> 08:20.801
This is Dad's book.

08:20.801 --> 08:21.902
Stan, you said
you put your blog on here.

08:21.902 --> 08:24.104
This is Dad's flash drive.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.976
Well, that's weird.
Good news, kids.

08:25.976 --> 08:28.979
My editor read
my new book and loved it.

08:28.979 --> 08:30.881
I'm gonna talk to him
all about it tomorrow,

08:30.881 --> 08:33.113
but he said
it was an innovative

08:33.113 --> 08:34.514
and different approach

08:34.514 --> 08:37.087
to writing about
family dynamics.

08:37.087 --> 08:38.649
So thank you,
kids.

08:38.649 --> 08:40.721
If we were just
a little more normal,

08:40.721 --> 08:42.723
this would
not have been possible.

08:45.726 --> 08:47.127
This is terrible.

08:47.127 --> 08:49.159
If we have
Dad's flash drive,

08:49.159 --> 08:52.703
that must mean he sent
Stan's flash drive by mistake.

08:52.703 --> 08:54.304
The editor
didn't read Dad's book,

08:54.304 --> 08:56.306
he read Stan's blog.

08:56.306 --> 08:58.168
And found it innovative
and different,

08:58.168 --> 09:00.911
which is really gratifying,
but I can't sound excited

09:00.911 --> 09:03.914
because
you guys are upset.

09:03.914 --> 09:06.717
Stan, when Dad talks
to his editor tomorrow,

09:06.717 --> 09:09.049
he's going to find out
about your blog.

09:09.049 --> 09:12.823
Mom and Dad are gonna
find out your secrets.
What are we gonna do?

09:12.823 --> 09:14.224
This may not work,
but I'm hoping

09:14.224 --> 09:16.556
if you wear your clothes
backwards and run real fast,

09:16.556 --> 09:18.258
you can turn back time.

09:20.591 --> 09:22.833
I found yesterday's
newspaper.

09:22.833 --> 09:24.134
It worked.

09:29.900 --> 09:31.241
What are we gonna do?

09:31.241 --> 09:33.203
We have to keep
Dad's editor

09:33.203 --> 09:35.045
from talking to Dad
about Stan's blog

09:35.045 --> 09:37.107
or Mom and Dad
will find out Stan's secret.

09:39.349 --> 09:42.082
Tyler, are you
hooding snacks, too?

09:42.082 --> 09:43.714
Well, hoods aren't just
for heads anymore.

09:43.714 --> 09:45.916
Get with the times, Avery.

09:47.187 --> 09:49.359
Wait. I have an idea
for how to keep Dad

09:49.359 --> 09:52.623
from seeing the blog
he sent to his editor.

09:52.623 --> 09:54.895
No, it would ruin things
between Dad and his editor,

09:54.895 --> 09:57.127
and we can't do that.

09:57.127 --> 09:58.999
I did hear your dad say
the guy is nitpicky

09:58.999 --> 10:02.172
and annoying and he wants
a different editor.

10:02.172 --> 10:04.604
Then maybe
we can do this.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.638
Stan, do you know
what an agent is?

10:07.638 --> 10:09.139
You mean
someone who finds jobs

10:09.139 --> 10:11.241
for writers in exchange
for a percentage of the money

10:11.241 --> 10:12.813
the writer earns
from said writing,

10:12.813 --> 10:15.916
or the active ingredient
in a cleaning solution?

10:15.916 --> 10:18.388
The first one.
Then no, no,
I don't know what it is.

10:20.390 --> 10:22.392
Hello, is this Barry Barns,
the book editor?

10:22.392 --> 10:24.354
Yes. Who is this?
And how did you
get my direct line?

10:24.354 --> 10:26.256
Did my assistant--

10:26.256 --> 10:28.258
Marcus,
pull your personnel file,

10:28.258 --> 10:32.162
and put another
frowny face sticker on it!

10:32.162 --> 10:34.004
I'm Bennett James' agent Stan.

10:34.004 --> 10:38.238
Stan Agent-guy.

10:38.238 --> 10:40.841
Well, that's the most
made-up sounding last name
I've ever heard.

10:40.841 --> 10:42.112
Then you haven't
met my cousin,

10:42.112 --> 10:44.174
Craig Made-up-last-name.

10:44.174 --> 10:46.646
It used to be
Made-up-last-nameowitz,

10:46.646 --> 10:50.280
but he shortened it
when he got into showbiz.

10:50.280 --> 10:53.283
The thing is, Bennett doesn't
want to work with you anymore.

10:53.283 --> 10:56.156
So don't talk to him
about the book ever again.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.387
But you can talk to me.

10:57.387 --> 10:59.960
What made it so innovative
and different?

10:59.960 --> 11:01.391
Stan.
Focus.

11:01.391 --> 11:03.363
What was that?
Uh, two people I hired

11:03.363 --> 11:06.136
to stand in my office
and remind me to focus.

11:06.136 --> 11:09.439
Marcus, get me two people
to stand in my office
and remind me to focus!

11:11.201 --> 11:12.903
I'm just gonna talk
to Bennett directly.

11:12.903 --> 11:14.274
I didn't even know
he had an agent.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.076
How do I even know
you are his agent?

11:16.076 --> 11:18.048
You could just be
some crazy guy.

11:18.048 --> 11:20.280
Please. If I were a crazy guy,
my name would be Stan...

11:20.280 --> 11:22.052
( blabbering )

11:26.817 --> 11:28.388
Stan!
Focus.

11:28.388 --> 11:31.091
Wow.
Those guys are good.

11:31.091 --> 11:33.263
If I'm not Bennett's agent,

11:33.263 --> 11:35.826
then how do I know you
had chicken cacciatore
at your last lunch with him?

11:35.826 --> 11:39.269
And that you spit it
all over his shirt.

11:39.269 --> 11:42.202
He told me how gross
and disgusting you are.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.874
He wants nothing
to do with you.

11:43.874 --> 11:45.435
He said that?

11:45.435 --> 11:48.879
Oh, that's insulting
and hurtful,

11:48.879 --> 11:50.741
and makes me think of
my own behavior

11:50.741 --> 11:53.283
in ways
I would prefer not to.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.817
You can tell--
You can tell Bennett

11:56.817 --> 11:59.850
our relationship is over,
as is this call.

11:59.850 --> 12:02.392
I'm late for an important
eye appointment.

12:02.392 --> 12:05.155
Really? Which is your
important eye, the
left or the right?

12:05.155 --> 12:07.297
Never call me again.

12:08.929 --> 12:11.001
Way to go, Stan.
You did it.

12:11.001 --> 12:13.133
You are a wizard
with prank phone calls.

12:13.133 --> 12:15.235
Oh, call me next Halloween
as Count Dracula.

12:15.235 --> 12:18.368
I'll have forgotten
about this by then.

12:18.368 --> 12:22.943
Hey, Chloe.
Wait, what's that
in Suzie's mouth?

12:22.943 --> 12:25.275
Suzie's pacifier.
No, it's not.
It's a flash drive.

12:25.275 --> 12:27.047
Yes.
And Suzie is not a real baby.

12:27.047 --> 12:29.820
It's called imagination.

12:33.053 --> 12:34.985
Wait.

12:34.985 --> 12:37.958
Stan, this is the flash drive
with your blog on it.

12:37.958 --> 12:40.060
Dad didn't give it
to his editor,

12:40.060 --> 12:43.293
which means we got
Dad fired for nothing.

12:43.293 --> 12:45.135
Well, we got two people
hired to remind Barry

12:45.135 --> 12:48.939
to focus, so it's still
a net gain for the economy.

12:48.939 --> 12:51.541
But if we have the flash drive
with Stan's blog on it,

12:51.541 --> 12:54.304
and the one
with Dad's book,

12:54.304 --> 12:56.406
then what did the editor read?

12:58.909 --> 13:01.551
So, Dad,
hypothetical question.

13:01.551 --> 13:04.314
If a person were
to send an editor,

13:04.314 --> 13:07.517
let's say, a book,

13:07.517 --> 13:10.260
how would
he or she do that?

13:10.260 --> 13:12.362
It's all by email now.
Why are you asking?

13:12.362 --> 13:14.364
I'm always asking questions.

13:14.364 --> 13:16.196
How else
would I have learned

13:16.196 --> 13:19.830
that this part of the turkey
is called the snood.

13:19.830 --> 13:23.203
So a person would never send
an editor a flash drive?

13:23.203 --> 13:25.035
No, of course not.

13:25.035 --> 13:26.837
Why would I send a flash drive
to someone for no reason?

13:26.837 --> 13:29.139
Those things
are like ten bucks.

13:29.139 --> 13:31.141
( phone ringing )
Ah, it's my editor.

13:31.141 --> 13:34.484
Probably thought of some
more praise to heap on me.

13:34.484 --> 13:37.317
Barry, hi.
How is it go--

13:37.317 --> 13:39.389
I can't believe you said all
those hurtful things about me.

13:39.389 --> 13:41.491
You're through, you hear me?
You're through!

13:41.491 --> 13:43.323
I'm never publishing another
book of yours ever again.

13:43.323 --> 13:47.197
You can forget it.
Our relationship is over!

13:47.197 --> 13:49.159
Turns out,
it wasn't praise.

13:51.301 --> 13:53.533
Barry is not publishing
the book.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.165
But based
on my AMB credit,

13:55.165 --> 13:56.867
I already booked a gig
as a humorist

13:56.867 --> 13:58.268
for the ladies auxiliary
of Whittier,

13:58.268 --> 14:02.142
so I could make a joke
about being wittier...

14:02.142 --> 14:03.443
which would
not have worked

14:03.443 --> 14:05.615
if I booked myself
at Pico Rivera.

14:05.615 --> 14:08.949
Honey, I do not
have an editor now.
This is terrible.

14:08.949 --> 14:11.121
But I thought you
didn't like your editor.

14:11.121 --> 14:12.382
I thought you wanted
to find a different editor.

14:12.382 --> 14:14.224
I was just
blowing off steam.

14:14.224 --> 14:15.926
Oh, yeah,
Barry is annoying,

14:15.926 --> 14:18.358
but he sells my books
and I don't know
who else to go to.

14:18.358 --> 14:21.091
It took me five years
just to get him.

14:21.091 --> 14:23.493
And when did you hear me say
I wanted a different editor?

14:23.493 --> 14:25.896
When?

14:25.896 --> 14:28.498
It's not like I check
the clock every time
I learn new information.

14:28.498 --> 14:31.271
I'm inquisitive,
not compulsive.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.073
What are we gonna do,
Bennett?

14:33.073 --> 14:36.506
We get most of our money
from your books.

14:36.506 --> 14:40.350
Listen, kids, you don't
need to worry about money.

14:40.350 --> 14:42.182
I'm sure
everything will be okay.

14:42.182 --> 14:44.955
I'll do that gig
in Pico Rivera.

14:44.955 --> 14:47.557
What's funny
about Pico Rivera?

14:47.557 --> 14:50.120
Pico, pico, pico...

14:50.120 --> 14:53.964
Oh, Pico-boo.
Okay, I'm in.

14:53.964 --> 14:57.227
So your mom is going
to be a comedienne.

14:57.227 --> 14:59.529
Solid, solid back-up plan.

15:04.074 --> 15:06.276
Guys, if we get
most of our money

15:06.276 --> 15:08.578
from Dad's books,
what are we gonna do?

15:08.578 --> 15:11.581
Avery, it's gonna be okay,
isn't it?

15:11.581 --> 15:14.044
I don't know, Stan.

15:14.044 --> 15:16.586
This family could
be in big trouble.

15:16.586 --> 15:18.518
What did we do?

15:21.992 --> 15:23.493
This will be my last blog.

15:23.493 --> 15:25.295
In order to save
Bennett's career,

15:25.295 --> 15:28.598
and this family
that I love so much,

15:28.598 --> 15:30.630
I'm gonna go
tell his editor

15:30.630 --> 15:33.163
the truth about what happened
and give up the secret

15:33.163 --> 15:37.307
that I am a talking dog.

15:42.312 --> 15:46.046
Guys, you better see
Stan's latest blog.

15:48.148 --> 15:51.281
( gasps )
Stan is going
to see Dad's editor

15:51.281 --> 15:53.583
to tell the truth
about everything.

15:53.583 --> 15:55.285
He's gonna reveal
his secret

15:55.285 --> 15:58.288
to save Dad's career
and the family.

15:58.288 --> 16:00.430
He'll be taken away
and experimented on.

16:00.430 --> 16:03.393
We have to stop him
from doing this.

16:03.393 --> 16:04.734
We'd be better off

16:04.734 --> 16:06.536
if the editor
had read Stan's blog.

16:06.536 --> 16:08.198
Maybe he wouldn't have
even been interested

16:08.198 --> 16:11.241
in the time
you stole a pig
or Chloe's tea parties,

16:11.241 --> 16:13.543
or when everyone
applauded my haircut.

16:13.543 --> 16:15.345
Okay, he would have
loved that last one.

16:15.345 --> 16:19.309
It had suspense, drama
and a charismatic leading man.

16:19.309 --> 16:20.350
Wait.

16:20.350 --> 16:22.282
He wrote
about my tea parties?

16:22.282 --> 16:24.084
Those are super secret.

16:24.084 --> 16:25.985
That's what
makes them special.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.288
I'm never gonna
pet Stan again.

16:29.559 --> 16:31.361
Of course,
you will, Chloe,

16:31.361 --> 16:33.323
because you love him.

16:33.323 --> 16:35.095
And you're a petter,
you have to pet.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.196
No, I don't.

16:36.196 --> 16:37.767
You're petting
Tyler right now.

16:37.767 --> 16:40.030
It feels good.

16:40.030 --> 16:41.601
Those little fingers
are strong,

16:41.601 --> 16:43.573
and they really
get in there.

16:43.573 --> 16:45.275
We don't have time
for this right now.

16:45.275 --> 16:46.506
We have to get to
Barry's office

16:46.506 --> 16:48.308
before Stan does anything.

16:48.308 --> 16:51.141
Those fingers
really do get in there.

16:53.243 --> 16:55.045
So here's
the thing, Barry.

16:55.045 --> 16:57.217
When I called you
on the phone before

16:57.217 --> 16:58.718
and said
all those things about

16:58.718 --> 17:00.520
Bennett not wanting you
to publish the book,

17:00.520 --> 17:02.522
that wasn't the truth.

17:02.522 --> 17:06.326
The truth is I'm a dog.

17:08.158 --> 17:10.300
All agents are dogs,
and don't think

17:10.300 --> 17:13.333
you can intimidate me
just because I had
an eyelid rejuvenation.

17:13.333 --> 17:16.266
It is the manliest of all
elective cosmetic
eye procedures.

17:18.308 --> 17:19.439
No, you don't understand.

17:19.439 --> 17:21.611
When I said I was a dog,
I mean--

17:21.611 --> 17:23.273
Stan, you can't do--

17:23.273 --> 17:25.575
Now who's here?
More people
in my office?

17:25.575 --> 17:28.248
That's right.
People, just people,

17:28.248 --> 17:30.620
two-legged creatures
with opposable thumbs,

17:30.620 --> 17:32.622
able to use hammers
and drive cars,

17:32.622 --> 17:34.624
sometimes
with all the mirrors

17:34.624 --> 17:36.426
pointing at themselves.

17:38.288 --> 17:40.190
I don't care
if you have hammers.

17:40.190 --> 17:42.192
I am not validating
your parking.

17:42.192 --> 17:45.535
Joke's on you 'cause
I already lost my ticket.

17:45.535 --> 17:49.299
Wait, here it is.
Dang it!

17:49.299 --> 17:51.141
Stan, don't do this.

17:51.141 --> 17:52.242
I have to.

17:52.242 --> 17:54.144
I have to save
Bennett's career.

17:54.144 --> 17:56.276
Barry,
I'm really a dog.

17:56.276 --> 17:58.178
( barking )

17:58.178 --> 18:00.410
We're all dogs.

18:00.410 --> 18:02.482
( imitating dogs )

18:05.685 --> 18:06.716
Marcus!

18:06.716 --> 18:08.588
Marcus,
are you back yet?

18:08.588 --> 18:11.191
There are loons with hammers
barking in my office.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.092
I don't know
what this means.

18:15.725 --> 18:18.268
Stan, you can't do this.

18:18.268 --> 18:19.769
We'll save Dad's career
another way

18:19.769 --> 18:21.431
and everything will be okay.

18:21.431 --> 18:22.702
Everything except

18:22.702 --> 18:24.504
my super-secret
tea party secret

18:24.504 --> 18:26.206
not being super-secret.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.607
I'm mad at you, Stan.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.379
I'm not gonna pet you
anymore.

18:29.379 --> 18:30.780
Chloe, this isn't
the time for this.

18:30.780 --> 18:34.344
Avery, just let her
make her point.

18:34.344 --> 18:36.486
Okay, Avery,
try it your way.

18:36.486 --> 18:39.289
But if it doesn't work,
I'll go full dog on him.

18:39.289 --> 18:41.391
I'll jump in his lap
and burp kibble in his face.

18:41.391 --> 18:44.254
I'm holding one in the top
of my throat right now.

18:44.254 --> 18:45.495
( burps )

18:45.495 --> 18:47.557
I'll come up
with something else.

18:47.557 --> 18:48.898
What are you
whispering about?

18:48.898 --> 18:51.261
You better not be
messing with me.

18:51.261 --> 18:53.533
I warn you,
I train at a boxing
gym every day,

18:53.533 --> 18:55.365
jumping rope.

18:55.365 --> 18:58.838
You don't want
none of this.

18:58.838 --> 19:00.670
It's okay, Mr. Barns,
we're just here

19:00.670 --> 19:03.243
because you have to publish
our dad's book.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.245
And you think bursting
into my office like this

19:05.245 --> 19:07.217
and telling me
to publish your dad's book

19:07.217 --> 19:08.618
is gonna make me
publish it?

19:08.618 --> 19:11.321
You got 60 seconds,
dazzle me.

19:11.321 --> 19:14.754
Well,
our dad is Bennett James.
Time's up.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.486
You should have heard
the horribly insulting things

19:16.486 --> 19:19.259
this crazy agent
had to say to me.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.830
I am never--

19:20.830 --> 19:24.334
I am never working
with Bennett James again.

19:24.334 --> 19:26.266
Okay.
We tried it your way.

19:26.266 --> 19:28.838
Now I'm gonna put
my snout in his face.

19:28.838 --> 19:31.341
When he feels it,
he'll know I'm either a dog

19:31.341 --> 19:34.244
or a hairy person
with no boundaries.

19:34.244 --> 19:36.246
Barry,
this may shock you.

19:36.246 --> 19:37.647
Wait, don't do this.

19:37.647 --> 19:40.250
You're family,
we can't lose you.

19:40.250 --> 19:41.851
You kids think of me
as family?

19:41.851 --> 19:44.414
I had no idea.
That's really sweet.

19:44.414 --> 19:46.686
I thought you were mad at me
because of what I did.

19:46.686 --> 19:50.460
You were just repeating it.
I was really mad at Bennett.

19:50.460 --> 19:53.323
You can be mad at someone,
but if you care about them,

19:53.323 --> 19:54.694
you forgive them.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.496
I do care about Bennett.

19:56.496 --> 19:58.328
He is the only one
of my writers

19:58.328 --> 20:00.430
who still goes to lunch
with me.

20:00.430 --> 20:03.273
You have the kindest,
most tender soul of anyone

20:03.273 --> 20:05.375
I have ever encountered.

20:05.375 --> 20:06.736
That's true.

20:06.736 --> 20:08.508
I put myself
out there.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.280
It's why I'm so easily hurt.

20:11.341 --> 20:12.912
So everything is okay?

20:12.912 --> 20:15.815
You're not gonna do
anything crazy here, right?

20:15.815 --> 20:17.687
Yeah, cutting things off
with my favorite writer

20:17.687 --> 20:19.249
would be crazy.

20:19.249 --> 20:21.321
I'm gonna publish
Bennett's book.

20:21.321 --> 20:23.993
What?

20:23.993 --> 20:25.795
Marcus, are you back?

20:25.795 --> 20:28.258
Did you get the stuff
I wanted?

20:28.258 --> 20:30.300
I can walk there myself.

20:30.300 --> 20:32.462
I can do this.
Nobody help me.

20:32.462 --> 20:34.334
I have to do this,

20:34.334 --> 20:35.935
'cause I'm gonna
have to live like this

20:35.935 --> 20:37.607
for the rest
of my afternoon

20:37.607 --> 20:39.839
when I can take
these bandages off.

20:39.839 --> 20:43.613
He's gonna publish the book
and my secret is safe?

20:43.613 --> 20:45.475
How did this happen?

20:45.475 --> 20:47.347
I don't know.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.349
And he's in such a good mood,
maybe he'll validate.

20:49.349 --> 20:50.980
Oh, I lost my ticket again.
Dang it.

20:50.980 --> 20:53.483
Oh, here it is.

20:57.657 --> 20:59.459
I'm so glad you forgave me,

20:59.459 --> 21:02.332
and that we're still doing
our super-secret tea parties.

21:02.332 --> 21:04.294
Yeah. But now
that the secret's out,

21:04.294 --> 21:06.436
it's impossible
to keep out the riff-raff.

21:06.436 --> 21:09.268
I'm never gonna miss
one of these ever again.

21:10.400 --> 21:13.272
So now that the kids
know about my blog,

21:13.272 --> 21:15.305
things are gonna be
different around here,

21:15.305 --> 21:18.047
but in the ways that count,
they're back to normal.

21:18.047 --> 21:22.382
You need a comma between
"count" and "they're."

21:22.382 --> 21:25.014
You know, I've been thinking
about the name for your blog.

21:25.014 --> 21:29.589
What about "See Stan blog
about Tyler's hair"?

21:29.589 --> 21:31.721
Because I want you
to be successful.

21:31.721 --> 21:34.524
And since I am going
to be eight soon,

21:34.524 --> 21:37.497
maybe we should hold off
on publishing that
rainbow farts thing.

21:37.497 --> 21:40.930
Wait, was that?
Yeah, hold off on it.

21:42.402 --> 21:46.406
Well, mostly
back to normal.
