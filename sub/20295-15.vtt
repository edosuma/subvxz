-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:30.567 --> 00:32.633
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:32.667 --> 00:35.200
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:35.233 --> 00:36.567
in a court of law.

00:38.467 --> 00:40.433
-I've been with Pierce County
for about two years now.

00:40.467 --> 00:42.167
Next month will be
my two-year mark.

00:42.200 --> 00:44.167
What I enjoy about it
is being out and about.

00:44.200 --> 00:46.500
I'm not a behind-the-desk
type of person.

00:46.533 --> 00:48.100
I did 20 years
in the Marine Corps,

00:48.133 --> 00:50.533
but law enforcement
was always in the back
of my mind.

00:50.567 --> 00:52.500
So when I retired
out of the Marine Corps,

00:52.533 --> 00:55.400
this was what I wanted to do.

00:55.433 --> 00:57.967
All right, we're en route
to a domestic dispute

00:58.000 --> 01:00.333
between a brother and a sister.
It's just down the road here.

01:00.367 --> 01:05.167
Apparently, the brother
is trying to get back in.
He's a 46-year-old white male.

01:05.200 --> 01:08.633
And the sister says
she can hear him
at the front door.

01:08.667 --> 01:10.267
He's trying
to break down the door.

01:10.300 --> 01:12.933
He's got a crowbar in his hand.
So we'll see what we've got

01:12.967 --> 01:16.267
when we get here.
We'll be here in just a second.

01:16.300 --> 01:18.267
-(radio beeps)
585, county last call.

01:18.300 --> 01:19.833
-Man on radio:
585 (indistinct)

01:19.867 --> 01:22.267
-(car door opens)
-(car door closes)

01:22.300 --> 01:24.700
-I think he's down there,
with the door open.

01:24.733 --> 01:27.467
-Uh-huh.
-But, um, yeah,
that's where he's staying.

01:27.500 --> 01:30.167
And he's busted both
of my locks, my front door
and my back door.

01:30.200 --> 01:32.367
So, anyways,
he hasn't been here
for two months.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.633
-I like, put an order
against him.
-Uh-huh.

01:34.667 --> 01:39.067
And I told the judge
that I dropped it because
he's got severe mental issues.

01:39.100 --> 01:41.700
-Uh-huh.
-And he's drunk.
He drinks every day.

01:41.733 --> 01:43.767
He's an alcoholic
and he takes medication.

01:43.800 --> 01:45.367
And so anyways,

01:45.400 --> 01:47.067
I do have his stuff here.

01:47.100 --> 01:49.733
And I told the judge
that all I want
is his stuff out.

01:49.767 --> 01:51.400
And the judge goes,

01:51.433 --> 01:53.300
"Do you understand that, Mike?"

01:53.333 --> 01:55.667
And he's like, "Yeah,
I have no other choice."
And so--

01:55.700 --> 01:57.467
-Okay.
-And the officer
last night said,

01:57.500 --> 02:00.133
"If you stay here,
I'll arrest you."

02:00.167 --> 02:03.333
-Okay.
-So-- But he watches every move
I have, here.

02:03.367 --> 02:05.800
And it's like,
he's been living there,
so he knows.

02:05.833 --> 02:07.200
-Is that him right there?
-Yeah.

02:07.233 --> 02:09.067
-Hey, come here! Stop!

02:10.067 --> 02:11.500
I said stop!

02:12.900 --> 02:14.933
-I didn't say--
What are you doing,
running at me, man?

02:14.967 --> 02:16.367
-Turn around.
-No.

02:16.400 --> 02:18.267
-Turn around.
-What? For what?

02:18.300 --> 02:20.333
-You're being detained
for an investigation.
Turn around.

02:20.367 --> 02:21.833
-I ain't turning around for--
-Turn around.

02:21.867 --> 02:23.567
-No, you have to tell me
why I'm being detained.

02:23.600 --> 02:25.767
-You're being detained
for an investigation.

02:25.800 --> 02:27.167
Turn around,
I'm not gonna ask you again.

02:27.200 --> 02:28.533
No,
you have to tell me why.

02:28.567 --> 02:32.200
Because there's an investigation
of you breaking and entering

02:32.233 --> 02:33.733
on your sister's place
over there.

02:33.767 --> 02:35.567
-Are you serious?
-Take your hands
out of your pocket.

02:35.600 --> 02:37.833
Take your hands
out of your pocket.
-Don't touch me, man.

02:37.867 --> 02:39.133
-Turn around.
-That's where I live.

02:39.167 --> 02:40.500
-Turn around.
-Don't touch me.

02:40.533 --> 02:41.800
-Turn around.
-That's where I live.

02:41.833 --> 02:43.333
-I said turn around.

02:43.367 --> 02:44.633
-No, that's where I live, bro.

02:44.667 --> 02:46.267
-I said turn around.
-That's where I live.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.067
-Turn around.
-That's where I live.

02:48.100 --> 02:49.900
-Okay, you're gonna
go down on the ground.
-No, I'm not.

02:49.933 --> 02:51.333
-Ready?
-You gonna shoot me?

02:51.367 --> 02:53.667
You gonna--
Oh, okay.

02:53.700 --> 02:56.267
Okay.
-Get down.

02:56.300 --> 02:57.867
-Shoot me, shoot me, quick.
-Get down.

02:57.900 --> 02:59.500
-Hurry up, shoot me.
Hurry up, shoot me.

02:59.533 --> 03:02.067
-Get down on the ground.
-In front of the whole world.

03:02.100 --> 03:04.267
-Get both of your hands out.

03:04.300 --> 03:06.567
-Okay. Or what?

03:06.600 --> 03:08.300
What the hell's going on?

03:08.333 --> 03:10.300
Oh, wow.

03:10.333 --> 03:12.067
-Sit up.
-I didn't do nothing.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.200
-Sit up.
-I don't know how.

03:14.233 --> 03:17.433
My leg hurts.
My leg hurts. My leg hurts.

03:19.233 --> 03:21.167
Don't (bleep)
manhandle me, dude.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.400
You better slow your roll, bro.
-Okay.

03:23.433 --> 03:25.833
-I didn't do anything.
I live there, man!

03:25.867 --> 03:27.300
Ten years.

03:27.333 --> 03:29.133
-It's the two months
that you didn't live there
that counts.

03:29.167 --> 03:31.067
-Yeah. No, not going.

03:31.067 --> 03:33.800
I didn't do anything wrong.
You gotta tell me
what I'm being charged with

03:33.833 --> 03:35.600
-for starters.
-We already told you--

03:35.633 --> 03:38.067
-I'm not stupid.
I didn't do anything wrong.
-Trespass and vandalism.

03:38.067 --> 03:40.133
-No, I didn't trespass
when my ID says I live there.

03:40.167 --> 03:41.500
-Get in the car.
-How is that trespassing

03:41.533 --> 03:43.700
when my ID
says I live there, dude?

03:43.733 --> 03:45.433
-Have a seat.
-No, I didn't do nothing wrong.

03:45.467 --> 03:46.600
-Get in the car.
-Have a seat.

03:46.633 --> 03:47.900
-No, I don't wanna
get in the car.
-Okay.

03:47.933 --> 03:49.767
-You gonna make me
get in the car?
-Yup.

03:53.767 --> 03:56.133
-All right,
I'll get in the goddamn car.

03:56.167 --> 03:58.067
-Then get in the car.
-Slow down, let me up.

03:59.067 --> 04:01.567
Goddamn, I didn't
do nothing wrong.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.867
I just wanna see my dog, dude.

04:03.900 --> 04:05.533
-She has your dog?
-Yeah.

04:05.567 --> 04:07.267
-Okay.
So what happened today?

04:07.300 --> 04:08.867
-I didn't go in the house today.

04:08.900 --> 04:10.800
I didn't
go in the house today.

04:10.833 --> 04:12.867
-So what--
-I just want
to see my dog, dude.

04:12.900 --> 04:14.367
-I got that, man.
I can understand that.

04:14.400 --> 04:15.700
-She has my dog, dude.

04:15.733 --> 04:18.100
-What did you do?
-I don't know, I was trying

04:18.133 --> 04:21.200
to knock on the door...
(continues indistinct)

04:21.233 --> 04:23.400
I didn't do anything wrong.

04:23.433 --> 04:25.133
-Did you break some locks?
-No.

04:25.167 --> 04:28.067
I've lived there forever dude,
my keys are right here.

04:28.067 --> 04:29.233
-When did you move out?

04:29.267 --> 04:32.133
-She told me to leave,
like, two months ago.

04:32.167 --> 04:33.767
-What'd your sister
kick you out for?

04:33.800 --> 04:35.300
-Well,
you won't believe me, but--

04:35.333 --> 04:36.567
-Try me, come on.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.333
-My mom says menopause.

04:38.367 --> 04:43.200
I've been there forever, dude,
and I know I wasn't doing
nothing wrong, dude.

04:43.233 --> 04:45.267
-I just want to see my dog.

04:45.300 --> 04:46.800
I didn't do nothing wrong.

04:46.833 --> 04:48.600
-Okay.
-I didn't do nothing wrong.

04:48.633 --> 04:51.167
-Hey, when I asked you
to turn around,
why'd you--

04:51.200 --> 04:53.400
-I was mad because
I didn't do nothing wrong.

04:53.433 --> 04:56.500
That's why.
-Okay, but she's saying
you had, like, a crowbar.

04:56.533 --> 04:58.467
-No, I had a little, tiny bar.

04:58.500 --> 05:02.233
I mean, like a little
screwdriver, but my keys
are right here.

05:02.267 --> 05:04.267
Because I just wanted
to see my dog, bro.

05:04.300 --> 05:06.067
-You want to see your dog?
-It hurts me.

05:06.067 --> 05:07.633
(bleep) hurts me, dude.

05:07.667 --> 05:11.133
-What were you using
the screwdriver-crowbar for?

05:11.167 --> 05:13.067
-To try to get in, I guess.

05:13.100 --> 05:15.167
-Bein' an idiot.
-Okay.

05:15.200 --> 05:16.800
All right, well,
just sit tight for a minute.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.067
Sister:
We just don't
get along.

05:20.100 --> 05:22.667
But I felt sorry for him
because I didn't want him
on the streets.

05:22.700 --> 05:26.633
And you know, here I let him
stay with me for so long
and he takes advantage of me.

05:26.667 --> 05:28.667
So I'm just getting sick of it,
you know?

05:28.700 --> 05:30.967
It's like, I come home
and the house is a wreck.

05:31.067 --> 05:34.567
He doesn't do anything,
and it's like my stuff
is being destroyed.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.067
-Yeah.
-So-- And--

05:37.067 --> 05:38.433
-Completely understandable.

05:38.467 --> 05:40.933
-And you know,
and I-- I give him everything.

05:40.967 --> 05:42.900
It's like, he had a computer
to use during the day.

05:42.933 --> 05:45.633
And it's like,
he had a cell phone. So...

05:45.667 --> 05:47.067
-Can I see the damage?

05:47.100 --> 05:48.733
-So he's busted
both my locks

05:48.767 --> 05:50.067
and I just
had the locks changed.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.400
-Okay. Do you think
I could show him his dog
real quick?

05:52.433 --> 05:54.167
-Rascal's crazy.
-Can I give it a try?

05:54.200 --> 05:55.900
-Yeah. Rascal, come here.

05:55.933 --> 05:57.467
-Crazy like he's gonna
bite my hand off?

05:57.500 --> 05:59.333
-Yeah, he bites me
and he bites him.

05:59.367 --> 06:00.700
It's okay, it's okay.

06:00.733 --> 06:02.200
-Hey, buddy.
-It's okay.

06:02.233 --> 06:03.500
-Hey.

06:03.533 --> 06:04.800
-It's okay, it's okay.

06:04.833 --> 06:06.533
-You want
to come with me, buddy?

06:06.567 --> 06:07.767
-It's okay.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.467
-(Rascal growls)
-You can try to hold him
if you want.

06:09.500 --> 06:10.900
Yeah, but just
be careful.

06:10.933 --> 06:13.733
He's got long-- Ow!
-(dog snarls)

06:13.767 --> 06:15.167
Oh, my god. Ow.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.067
Rascal, it's okay.

06:17.100 --> 06:18.333
-Rascal,
you're all right, buddy.

06:18.367 --> 06:20.400
-I feel bad because
he should not
be going to jail.

06:20.433 --> 06:22.867
-Yeah, unfortunately,
he has to.

06:22.900 --> 06:27.533
So I'm going to give him
a last chance to see his dog
before he ends up going to jail.

06:27.567 --> 06:30.200
Hey, Michael, just wanted
to give you a chance to see
your dog real quick.

06:30.233 --> 06:31.567
-Can I get out and like--
-No.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.467
-I didn't
do anything wrong, dude.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.833
-Okay. So you were trying
to use a screwdriver
to force it open?

06:35.867 --> 06:38.533
-No, I didn't know that.
I had my keys right here, dude.

06:38.567 --> 06:40.400
Just don't take me
to jail, please.

06:40.433 --> 06:42.900
I'll just (bleep) bail, dude.

06:42.933 --> 06:45.767
I'll just walk
way far away, dude, please?

06:45.800 --> 06:47.700
-Okay.
-I can't do it.

06:47.733 --> 06:49.100
-Do you want
to say goodbye to your dog?

06:50.433 --> 06:51.733
All right.

06:51.767 --> 06:55.067
-(sniffing) Rascal?

06:55.067 --> 06:58.467
Love you, baby.
Don't take me to jail, please.
-(Rascal growls)

06:58.500 --> 06:59.667
-All right.
-Please?

06:59.700 --> 07:01.833
You can't do this to me, man.

07:01.867 --> 07:03.433
-I can understand
you miss your dog.

07:08.333 --> 07:10.267
-I recently found out
I was gonna be a father again.

07:10.300 --> 07:12.133
Got a new family coming.

07:12.167 --> 07:14.067
A two-year-old,
another one on the way.

07:14.067 --> 07:16.067
It makes you appreciate
the little things in life.

07:16.067 --> 07:17.967
Makes you kind
of take a step back,

07:18.067 --> 07:19.733
see the bigger picture.

07:19.767 --> 07:25.200
And enjoy the time you get
to spend with your family
when you're not here at work.

07:25.233 --> 07:27.067
-(radio beeps)
-4301, dispatch.

07:27.067 --> 07:28.867
I'll take that call,
Wrightsboro at Jackson.

07:28.900 --> 07:31.500
We're to assist
Crime Suppression
with a traffic stop.

07:31.533 --> 07:35.767
Please request another unit
for a search of a vehicle.

07:38.300 --> 07:40.133
-What's up?
-What's up?

07:40.167 --> 07:41.900
-(indistinct chatter)

07:43.300 --> 07:44.767
-Put your cigarette out.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.700
Do you have anything on you
I need to know about?

07:48.733 --> 07:49.800
-No, sir.

07:49.833 --> 07:51.100
-Right here.

07:51.133 --> 07:52.433
Look the other way.

07:57.667 --> 07:59.433
-So I'm gonna ask you
something real quick, okay?

07:59.467 --> 08:00.933
-Okay.
-Is there anything
inside the vehicle

08:00.967 --> 08:02.067
I need to know about?

08:02.067 --> 08:03.433
-Yes, sir.
-Where's it at?

08:03.467 --> 08:05.433
-It's in here.
-No, no...

08:05.467 --> 08:07.100
Where's it at?
-Uh, it's...

08:07.133 --> 08:09.733
It's probably in...

08:09.767 --> 08:11.167
-I can smell it,
where's it at?

08:11.200 --> 08:14.067
-It's in that bag in there.

08:14.067 --> 08:15.100
-In which bag?

08:15.133 --> 08:16.400
-That bag on
the floorboard over there?

08:16.433 --> 08:17.767
-Actually, I don't know, man.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.200
-You don't know where
it's at in there?

08:19.233 --> 08:20.433
-No.

08:20.467 --> 08:22.100
-Well, did you put it in there?

08:22.133 --> 08:23.967
-Yes, sir. I mean,
it was a joint.

08:24.067 --> 08:25.967
If you want,
you could--

08:26.067 --> 08:27.667
-Okay, all right.
Do me a favor.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.133
-(mumbling)

08:30.167 --> 08:32.067
-No, I want you to come back
over here real quick.

08:33.200 --> 08:34.767
Have a seat right here for me.

08:34.800 --> 08:36.200
Sit down.

08:37.500 --> 08:39.600
What all do you have
in there?

08:39.633 --> 08:41.533
-Uh, just marijuana.
-How much?

08:43.167 --> 08:45.900
-It's not a whole lot.

08:47.067 --> 08:48.933
Not that I know of, man.
-You bought it, right?

08:48.967 --> 08:50.533
-Um, no.
-You should know
how much it is.

08:50.567 --> 08:54.767
-It's um, it's actually
not my belonging, dude.

08:54.800 --> 08:57.200
It's actually in the car.

08:57.233 --> 08:59.667
That's okay.
I'm going to jail.
All right.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.067
-Have you been honest with him?

09:03.067 --> 09:04.867
-Sir?
-Have you been honest
with him?

09:04.900 --> 09:06.400
-Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, I've been
honest with him.

09:06.433 --> 09:07.700
-Well, how much
is in there, then?

09:07.733 --> 09:09.467
-Uh, it's a grinder,
there's a little bowl in there,

09:09.500 --> 09:12.100
and there's a pipe in there,
and there's probably...

09:12.133 --> 09:15.067
and, you know,
a grinder gets you in jail.

09:15.100 --> 09:16.933
That's the marijuana
right there.

09:16.967 --> 09:18.933
And it's all bagged up
differently.

09:18.967 --> 09:21.133
I know that it looks like
intent to distribute,

09:21.167 --> 09:22.467
but it's not.

09:22.500 --> 09:23.733
-Whose bag is it?

09:23.767 --> 09:25.667
-The bookbag is my mother's.
-It's your mother's?

09:25.700 --> 09:29.067
-I'm not saying it's not my bag.
I'm saying I was using the bag,

09:29.067 --> 09:32.067
but... you know, it's just not--

09:32.067 --> 09:34.267
-Hey, what about
all these pills in here?

09:34.300 --> 09:35.400
-Those are my mother's.

09:35.433 --> 09:37.433
-Your mother's pills?
-Yes, sir.

09:37.467 --> 09:39.467
She's got a prescription
for them, officer.

09:39.500 --> 09:41.500
-They're in the same bag
that your marijuana's in.

09:41.533 --> 09:45.900
-Yes, they are because
fenadine, muscle relaxers,
and she had her Xanax in there.

09:45.933 --> 09:47.900
-Where's her prescription at?

09:47.933 --> 09:51.600
-It's on her person.
She has it, sir.

09:51.633 --> 09:55.133
-Pulled him over
for a traffic violation.
His window is busted

09:55.167 --> 09:58.367
right from the driver.
As soon as I stopped the car,
you could smell the odor

09:58.400 --> 10:00.967
of marijuana.
There's a whole variety
of pills there,

10:01.000 --> 10:02.733
there's Xanax in there,
and all kinds

10:02.767 --> 10:05.300
of different painkillers.

10:05.333 --> 10:10.033
Then there is, in a breath mint
box... in the 17 years
I've been doing this,

10:10.067 --> 10:13.767
I can't see I've ever ran across
anybody that had their marijuana
individually packaged,

10:13.800 --> 10:19.233
and each one of the packages
have individual prices
written on the bag.

10:19.267 --> 10:21.567
But I guess there's a first time
for everything.

10:21.600 --> 10:24.933
Hey, David, I know you said
this is your mom's backpack--

10:24.967 --> 10:26.700
-It's not my mom's backpack,
it's mine.

10:26.733 --> 10:30.000
It's my backpack, my mom
uses it from time to time...
-Okay...

10:30.033 --> 10:31.900
-to put her meds in?

10:31.933 --> 10:36.167
I'd forgotten to mention
the pills, and I-- that's--

10:36.200 --> 10:39.300
that was not something I--
-Do me a favor, put your hands
behind your back.

10:39.333 --> 10:42.167
Just stay seated.

10:42.200 --> 10:45.933
-He said he doesn't
have prior pill convictions.

10:45.967 --> 10:48.133
I-- I'm not trying to be...
a druggie right now,

10:48.167 --> 10:51.000
I'm really tryin' to take care
of a family that--

10:51.033 --> 10:54.033
-Well, I mean, if--
if you're trying to take care
of a family, why in the world

10:54.067 --> 10:57.100
would you have all that mess?
-Dude-- I-- I shoulda

10:57.133 --> 11:00.067
even thought
about cleaning it out
before I went anywhere,

11:00.067 --> 11:02.300
but-- dude--
-I know, but you put the stuff
in there.

11:02.333 --> 11:04.967
-Not all of it was put in there
by me, man.

11:05.067 --> 11:08.833
But that's okay,
I do take responsibility
for the pot.

11:08.867 --> 11:10.900
-Okay. So you try to take care
of kids,

11:10.933 --> 11:13.433
but
you put individually packaged...

11:13.467 --> 11:15.367
-Well...
-marijuana inside the car.

11:15.400 --> 11:18.400
-I'm really tryin' to make it,
but I just didn't think
about it,

11:18.433 --> 11:20.833
I was bein' a dumbass...
excuse my language, sir.

11:20.867 --> 11:22.567
I was bein' a dummy.

11:22.600 --> 11:28.067
And I-- dude I-- I really
didn't realize that...

11:28.067 --> 11:30.733
-Have you smoked recently?
-No, sir.

11:30.767 --> 11:33.733
I smoked, it was
about 12 o'clock.

11:33.767 --> 11:38.200
Okay? And I didn't smoke it
but, like, I didn't hit it
but twice.

11:38.233 --> 11:40.533
-And you say you weren't
going to sell this,
but the prices

11:40.567 --> 11:44.833
are clearly listed on each bag.
You got $15 bags, $10 bags,

11:44.867 --> 11:47.367
-I'm not a dope dealer.
I'd be terrible at it.

11:47.400 --> 11:50.467
-Well, I mean... obviously,
this is a small amount.

11:50.500 --> 11:52.967
But this very much
makes it look like
you're sellin'...

11:53.067 --> 11:54.967
-I know it does.
-narcotics.

11:55.067 --> 11:57.233
-But I'm not.
I will crush that right now.

11:57.267 --> 11:59.700
-Well, no, this is gonna
go with me, this is evidence.
-I know it is.

11:59.733 --> 12:01.667
-Especially when you say
you're waiting
in the parking lot

12:01.700 --> 12:04.500
for a phone call. I'm going to
go ahead and sit you back here.
I got the windows down.

12:04.533 --> 12:06.833
You ready? One, two, three.

12:09.467 --> 12:13.600
I'm gonna throw your hat
inside the car, okay?

12:13.633 --> 12:18.967
-Sir, I'm apologizin'...
and I'm tryin' to stay
drug free,

12:19.067 --> 12:21.800
but... I was just
playin' around, man.
-What do you mean,

12:21.833 --> 12:24.867
playin' around?
-I-- I thought that the--

12:24.900 --> 12:28.333
marijuana looked cool
in different bags?
-Sure.

12:28.367 --> 12:30.400
I was an idiot.

12:30.433 --> 12:32.933
-Okay, well, who-- who
were you gonna sell it to?

12:32.967 --> 12:37.733
-Nobody, sir.
I was actually gonna smoke it.
And that is--

12:37.767 --> 12:40.367
-Well, why did you write
the prices on each bag?
-Because I wanted to know

12:40.400 --> 12:43.467
how much they were worth, man.
-Well, who was gonna tell you
that they were worth that...

12:43.500 --> 12:49.533
when you made the price up?
-I mean-- I'm... not a drug...
seller or any of that--

12:49.567 --> 12:52.467
-I'm not saying that you are,
I'm just trying to figure out
what's going on,

12:52.500 --> 12:55.767
the story behind everything.
-The story behind it is
I was just playin' around

12:55.800 --> 12:59.167
with it, and I wrote the prices,
I said, hey man,
what do you think

12:59.200 --> 13:02.067
this is-- 'cause he
wasn't weighing anything,
he was just--

13:02.100 --> 13:06.267
-Who did you ask this--
this price to?
-Uh, my-- my friend Nick,

13:06.300 --> 13:09.567
he was-- he's livin' over there
off of Boy Scout Road.

13:09.600 --> 13:12.867
-Does he know a lot
about the prices of marijuana?
-Yes, sir.

13:12.900 --> 13:14.567
-Okay.
And you thought
if you asked him,

13:14.600 --> 13:17.100
he'd kind of know
what it was worth?

13:17.133 --> 13:20.567
-Well, I mean...
I didn't really care
how much it was worth,

13:20.600 --> 13:24.267
but I cared how much
the bags would look like.

13:24.300 --> 13:28.400
I'm just-- I kind of like
to be a little creative.
-Sure. Well, here's the thing,

13:28.433 --> 13:31.300
you're goin' in
for possession of marijuana
with intent to distribute.

13:31.333 --> 13:34.267
You'll probably have at least
two different charges
of possession of, uh,

13:34.300 --> 13:36.567
prescription medication
without a prescription, okay?

13:36.600 --> 13:40.400
-With intent, that means
I serve years.
-Correct. But David,

13:40.433 --> 13:42.267
I know you say you're trying
to do the right thing, man,

13:42.300 --> 13:44.200
but you gotta
make better decisions than this.

13:44.233 --> 13:46.633
You really do.
So... I mean,
you're a grown man.

13:46.667 --> 13:48.367
And you know the difference
between right and wrong,

13:48.400 --> 13:49.733
and obviously you knew
this was wrong

13:49.767 --> 13:52.367
before you started riding around
with narcotics in your car.

13:56.800 --> 13:59.733
-One of my biggest pet peeves
is when you see parents
that have younger children

13:59.767 --> 14:02.933
and instead of saying "hi"
most of the time,

14:02.967 --> 14:05.833
you'll hear 'em
tell their kid,
"You better be good

14:05.867 --> 14:07.300
or he's gonna take you away."

14:07.333 --> 14:09.867
And it's not something
that we want children
to think of

14:09.900 --> 14:12.433
when they think
of law enforcement
or see a guy in uniform.

14:12.467 --> 14:15.300
We want them to know
that they can always
come to us

14:15.333 --> 14:18.167
if they ever
need help, because that's
what we're here for.

14:18.200 --> 14:22.667
So right now we're going
to a domestic in progress.

14:22.700 --> 14:26.433
A female had messaged her friend
on Facebook and said
that her wife or girlfriend

14:26.467 --> 14:29.933
was throwing a frying pan
at her or something like that,

14:29.967 --> 14:31.667
so we'll see what's going on.

14:43.067 --> 14:44.933
Sheriff's Office.

14:46.667 --> 14:48.467
Hey, how're you doin'?

14:48.500 --> 14:50.333
-Hey.
-Did you contact a friend
on Facebook?

14:50.367 --> 14:52.433
-Yeah.
-Okay. Can I-- can you
open the door

14:52.467 --> 14:54.433
so I can come inside
and see what's goin' on?

14:54.467 --> 14:56.433
Come out from behind the door.

14:56.467 --> 14:58.133
What's goin' on?

14:58.167 --> 15:02.233
-I was beaten.
-Okay, where's your wife
at right now?

15:02.267 --> 15:04.367
-Sleeping.
-She's sleeping now?

15:04.400 --> 15:06.800
Okay, what happened
with all this right here?

15:06.833 --> 15:10.500
-She hit me.
-Okay. You need, uh,
an ambulance

15:10.533 --> 15:12.100
or anything like that
for any injuries you have?

15:12.133 --> 15:14.700
-No.
-Okay. And she's
in there sleeping?

15:14.733 --> 15:16.367
-Yeah.
-Okay. What's her name?

15:16.400 --> 15:18.267
-Mara.
-Are there any weapons?

15:18.300 --> 15:19.367
-No.

15:19.400 --> 15:21.233
-Mara.
-Shut the door.

15:21.267 --> 15:24.067
-Wake up.
It's the Sheriff's Office.

15:24.100 --> 15:27.100
-Why?
-I'm here to talk to you
about what's goin' on.

15:27.133 --> 15:30.067
-What?
-I'm-- uncover your--
are you naked under there

15:30.067 --> 15:31.300
or you dressed?
-No, I'm dressed.

15:31.333 --> 15:33.067
-Okay.
What's goin' on right now?

15:33.067 --> 15:35.267
Sit up for me.
-I'm sleeping, it's...

15:35.300 --> 15:38.700
-Okay. Did you
get into an argument or a fight
with your, uh, girlfriend?

15:38.733 --> 15:41.133
-My wife?
-Your wife?

15:41.167 --> 15:44.600
-Earlier, I was sleeping.
-Get up, let's go.

15:44.633 --> 15:46.067
Let's come out here
and let's talk.

15:46.067 --> 15:48.667
-I'm sleeping.
-Let me ask you this
as well...

15:48.700 --> 15:50.733
that frying pan
that's on the bed,
is that the one

15:50.767 --> 15:52.067
that she hit you with,
do you know?

15:52.100 --> 15:54.067
Does she always
sleep with that or something?

15:54.067 --> 15:57.667
Or is that just... in there?
-It was-- it was on the floor,
she hit me with it.

15:57.700 --> 16:01.100
-Yeah, it's in the bed now,
it's like--
-I know, she took it with her.

16:01.133 --> 16:03.833
-Okay.
Mara, don't talk to her
right now.

16:03.867 --> 16:06.133
Go stand outside
and talk to that deputy.

16:06.167 --> 16:11.100
-What's going on?
-Go stand outside.
Mara, go outside.

16:11.133 --> 16:12.667
Let me see your arm.

16:12.700 --> 16:15.600
So, this mark on the inside
of your arm, was that
from the pan?

16:15.633 --> 16:18.433
-She hit me-- no, it wasn't
with the pan, she hit me.
-With a fist.

16:18.467 --> 16:21.633
-Yeah.
-Okay, so that's a fist,
what's this mark on your,

16:21.667 --> 16:24.300
uh, shoulder?
-I don't know.
I don't remember.

16:24.333 --> 16:27.800
-And when did this happen?
-Yesterday.

16:27.833 --> 16:30.533
-It happened yesterday?
-Yes.

16:30.567 --> 16:34.067
-All right, Mara.
She has a bruise on the inside
of her arm and her collarbone.

16:34.067 --> 16:35.467
-We had--
-What are those from?

16:35.500 --> 16:40.067
-Because she-- we drink a lot,
and then we get in arguments.

16:40.100 --> 16:43.533
-Okay.
-Yesterday, she had too much
to drink...

16:43.567 --> 16:48.967
-Okay.
-I wa-- I was not
as-- drinking as much.

16:49.067 --> 16:51.500
I had some to drink as well.

16:51.533 --> 16:55.667
And we had an argument,
and she started beating me up
and I fought back.

16:55.700 --> 17:00.833
I went into the room,
I tried to get away.
We both-- it's a mutual thing.

17:00.867 --> 17:03.367
-Okay. Why-- why
are you sleeping
with a frying pan?

17:03.400 --> 17:06.433
There's a frying pan
in your bed, what's up
with that?

17:06.467 --> 17:07.800
-Yeah, to protect myself.

17:07.833 --> 17:10.633
-Okay. Did you hit her
with that yesterday?
-No. No, sir.

17:10.667 --> 17:11.933
-Why is she saying you did?

17:11.967 --> 17:13.667
-I did not hit her
with it yesterday.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.733
-Well, she's saying you--
that you hit her
with the frying pan.

17:15.767 --> 17:19.067
-I did not,
it was to protect myself
from her.

17:19.067 --> 17:21.167
-Okay. Do you have
any other injuries
that I can visibly see?

17:21.200 --> 17:24.067
-No, she lured me
into the other room,
she said "Come here

17:24.100 --> 17:26.067
and we'll talk about it,
come here and we'll talk
about it,"

17:26.067 --> 17:27.933
and she had a knife
in her hand,
and I came into the room,

17:27.967 --> 17:30.800
and she-- and the knife
was there and I... walked in,

17:30.833 --> 17:33.200
and she cut me in my hand.
-And that's how
you got that injury?

17:33.233 --> 17:34.667
-Yes.
-That was yesterday?

17:34.700 --> 17:36.733
-Yes, sir.
-So everything that happened,
it all happened yesterday.

17:36.767 --> 17:37.933
-Yes, sir.

17:37.967 --> 17:40.700
-Well... Mara, this--
this is the deal, okay?

17:40.733 --> 17:44.167
She has injuries on her,
and based on what she's saying
happened and based on

17:44.200 --> 17:47.967
what you're saying happened,
okay, you're gonna have to be
placed under arrest

17:48.067 --> 17:51.067
for battery
domestic violence. Okay?
-Please... please...

17:51.067 --> 17:53.567
-It's-- it's not a choice
I have, it's based
on the evidence, all right?

17:53.600 --> 17:56.400
-Please sir, can I--
can I put my phone
back in the house?

17:56.433 --> 17:58.867
-Yeah, I'll take your phone,
don't worry about it.
-Please sir, please sir,

17:58.900 --> 18:00.633
please sir, please?
-Put your hand
behind your back.

18:00.667 --> 18:03.200
-I'm leaving
for a treatment center tomorrow.
-Put your hand behind your back.

18:03.233 --> 18:06.233
-Please sir, please sir,
please sir, please sir,
I didn't mean to hurt her.

18:06.267 --> 18:09.767
I didn't, why'd she hurt me?
-Just relax.

18:09.800 --> 18:13.133
-She hurt me!
(sobbing)
-Relax.

18:13.167 --> 18:19.067
-Please, sir!
Please sir, please sir,
please sir, I'm begging you,

18:19.067 --> 18:21.967
please sir, neither of us
called the police.

18:22.067 --> 18:24.133
-I understand that,
but the thing is,

18:24.167 --> 18:26.700
is she contacted a friend
who contacted us
on her behalf,

18:26.733 --> 18:29.133
and that's
how we ended up here today.
-Please sir, please sir,

18:29.167 --> 18:32.333
she doesn't want me
to be arrested.
I don't have shoes on.

18:32.367 --> 18:33.500
-We'll grab flip flops for you.

18:33.533 --> 18:35.767
-No, she didn't want this
to happen!

18:35.800 --> 18:38.833
-Listen... in the state
of Florida, the victim
doesn't have the choice

18:38.867 --> 18:42.167
on whether or not
someone goes to jail
for battery domestic violence.

18:42.200 --> 18:44.500
-Please!
-Watch your seat, okay?

18:44.533 --> 18:46.667
It's gonna be easier
to sit down first,
then put your legs in.

18:46.700 --> 18:48.200
Have a seat. Have a seat.

18:48.233 --> 18:50.433
-Why are you doing this to me?
-Mara, have a seat.
Mara, sit down.

18:50.467 --> 18:53.333
-She got me!
-Mara, sit down.

18:53.367 --> 18:56.567
-(Mara sobbing)
-Put your feet in.

18:57.933 --> 19:00.233
-Can I wear a seat belt?

19:02.500 --> 19:06.800
-Kelsey... I wanted to give you
the, uh, Victims Assistance
Program pamphlet?

19:06.833 --> 19:08.833
It has
all the information on there,
'cause you're the victim

19:08.867 --> 19:12.300
of domestic violence.
So if you open up the inside,
it's gonna have information

19:12.333 --> 19:14.300
there. If you don't feel
like it's safe to live here,

19:14.333 --> 19:16.900
um... you can contact
some numbers on there,
get some help,

19:16.933 --> 19:19.133
and stuff like that,
'cause you are the victim
of domestic violence.

19:19.167 --> 19:22.500
They-- they offer places to stay
and things like that
and programs... all right?

19:22.533 --> 19:25.133
-Thank you.
-So... do you have cats?

19:25.167 --> 19:29.167
-Yeah.
-All right. Have you noticed
how bad the ammonia smell is

19:29.200 --> 19:30.967
in here?
-No?

19:31.067 --> 19:33.967
-You can't smell it anymore?
I'll tell you it's bad.

19:34.067 --> 19:35.267
The ammonia smell from the cats,

19:35.300 --> 19:36.833
I don't know
if they have a litter box
or something,

19:36.867 --> 19:39.467
but... 'cause if the landlord
finds out...
they're gonna end up

19:39.500 --> 19:41.133
charging you a lot to try
to clean the place up,

19:41.167 --> 19:42.767
you know?
-I'll-- I'll clean it.

19:42.800 --> 19:45.367
-It's really bad.
So hopefully you can get
the help you need, all right?

19:45.400 --> 19:46.933
-Thank you.

19:46.967 --> 19:49.700
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:49.733 --> 19:51.667
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:51.700 --> 19:52.833
Cover is code three.

19:52.867 --> 19:55.833
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:01.833 --> 20:03.600
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:03.633 --> 20:06.033
-(theme music playing)
