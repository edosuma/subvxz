00:13.567 --> 00:15.500
Cole, he's dead.

00:15.533 --> 00:18.067
Just go. Nobody knows you had
anything to do with this.

00:18.101 --> 00:19.234
I don't want you involved.

00:19.267 --> 00:20.468
<i>COLE:
I'm already involved.</i>

00:20.500 --> 00:22.401
We're cleaning this up,

00:22.434 --> 00:24.134
and no one's never gonna know
what happened.

00:24.167 --> 00:25.301
(grunting)

00:25.334 --> 00:27.334
They're scum, Dana,

00:27.368 --> 00:29.368
and no one's
gonna miss 'em.

00:29.401 --> 00:31.067
Kayla may be in danger.

00:31.101 --> 00:32.234
She's run away.

00:32.267 --> 00:33.600
With Tarin.

00:33.633 --> 00:35.368
<i>She's somewhere in the city</i>

00:35.401 --> 00:37.201
with no idea
that a nuclear threat exists.

00:37.234 --> 00:38.368
And, Omar, what about you?

00:38.401 --> 00:39.700
Don't worry about me.

00:39.734 --> 00:42.368
<i>Just help me find our daughter.</i>

00:42.401 --> 00:44.067
Come inside.

00:46.700 --> 00:48.334
They have the rods
you are looking for.

00:48.368 --> 00:49.834
I thought you had the rods.

00:49.867 --> 00:51.567
They turned against me.

00:51.600 --> 00:53.267
<i>I can help you find them.</i>

00:53.301 --> 00:54.934
Just get me out of here.

00:54.967 --> 00:56.067
You find Farhad?

00:56.101 --> 00:57.234
Still looking.

00:57.267 --> 00:58.434
He won't get far.

01:01.567 --> 01:03.600
(gunfire, groaning)

01:03.633 --> 01:04.667
Medic! Come on! Medic!

01:05.667 --> 01:06.767
I need you to identify the men

01:06.800 --> 01:07.867
who stole the nuclear rods
from you.

01:07.900 --> 01:09.667
Can you do that for us? Yes.

01:09.700 --> 01:11.034
Blood pressure's dropping.

01:11.067 --> 01:12.301
We got a rapid heartbeat.

01:12.334 --> 01:13.967
<i>JACK:
We lost him. Farhad's dead.</i>

01:14.001 --> 01:15.301
Damn it!

01:15.334 --> 01:16.500
Whoever shot Farhad
couldn't confirm

01:16.533 --> 01:17.667
that he was killed.

01:17.700 --> 01:19.368
I'm saying that we use
Farhad as dead bait.

01:19.401 --> 01:20.600
Leak it to the press

01:20.633 --> 01:22.201
that we've got him in custody,
and he survived,

01:22.234 --> 01:23.900
<i>and they'll have
to make a move on him.</i>

01:23.934 --> 01:25.434
Tell the support teams
it is imperative that

01:25.468 --> 01:26.700
we take these terrorists alive.

01:30.334 --> 01:31.700
Go! Go!

01:32.301 --> 01:33.633
It's all right.

01:33.667 --> 01:35.134
We just want to talk to you.

01:35.167 --> 01:36.533
No. No!

01:38.334 --> 01:39.700
(grunts)

01:39.734 --> 01:40.700
(panting)

01:40.734 --> 01:41.700
He's still moving.

01:41.734 --> 01:42.700
Notify the perimeter.

01:42.734 --> 01:44.934
(grunts)

01:48.600 --> 01:50.001
(panting)

01:53.368 --> 01:54.334
<i>MARCOS:
It was a trap.</i>

01:54.368 --> 01:55.700
Farhad was already dead.

01:55.734 --> 01:57.600
I locked myself in some
kind of oxygen chamber.

01:57.633 --> 01:58.700
They can't get in here.

01:58.734 --> 02:00.134
You know what you must do.

02:00.167 --> 02:02.334
I can't.
They scrambled the arming code.

02:02.368 --> 02:04.001
You need to set it off manually.

02:04.034 --> 02:05.900
You cannot let them
take you alive.

02:08.667 --> 02:09.900
Can you hear me?

02:11.000 --> 02:17.074

02:41.134 --> 02:43.101
(panting)

02:43.134 --> 02:44.533
JACK:
What's the status?

02:44.567 --> 02:46.468
The hyperbaric chamber is
one-inch steel all around.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.667
Hermetically sealed, air and
power systems are internal.

02:48.700 --> 02:50.700
Also, its atmosphere is
most likely oxygen-enriched.

02:50.734 --> 02:53.700
Anything we use to blow the door
could ignite a fire inside.

02:53.734 --> 02:55.001
How long will it take
to cut in?

02:55.034 --> 02:56.567
We need to use a low-speed
drill to avoid sparks.

02:56.600 --> 02:57.800
How long?

02:57.834 --> 02:59.700
Best estimate- 40 minutes,
unless you want us

02:59.734 --> 03:01.101
to push the risk.

03:01.134 --> 03:02.633
I can't take the chance.
We need him alive.

03:02.667 --> 03:04.167
Agent Bauer, the techs have got
the internal cameras online.

03:04.201 --> 03:05.334
We have eyes on him.

03:05.368 --> 03:06.500
What about
the intercom?

03:06.533 --> 03:07.633
The intercom's still down

03:07.667 --> 03:09.234
from when he shorted out
the locking mechanism.

03:09.267 --> 03:12.001
And the bomb techs say we
have a bigger problem. What?

03:12.034 --> 03:14.034
They assumed that once we jammed
the signal to the detonator,

03:14.067 --> 03:15.900
it'd be impossible for
the suspect to explode the vest.

03:15.934 --> 03:17.434
Turns out
that may not be the case.

03:17.468 --> 03:18.667
He's reconfiguring
the circuits.

03:18.700 --> 03:20.167
Yeah. The detonator's

03:20.201 --> 03:22.267
German military, so our guys
are familiar with it.

03:22.301 --> 03:24.533
The end-around he's
sketched out here will work.

03:24.567 --> 03:25.667
What's the timeframe?

03:25.700 --> 03:27.001
Well, it depends on
how fast he works.

03:27.034 --> 03:28.667
He needs to reset
four circuits.

03:28.700 --> 03:32.533
That LED light indicates
he's already completed one.

03:32.567 --> 03:33.700
When he wires the other three,

03:33.734 --> 03:35.468
he'll be able to explode
the device at will.

03:35.500 --> 03:37.167
The only upside is the chamber
will contain the blast.

03:37.201 --> 03:38.334
No one else will be hurt.

03:38.368 --> 03:39.667
He's not trying to hurt anybody.

03:39.700 --> 03:41.434
He's trying to make sure
we don't take him alive.

03:41.468 --> 03:42.667
Get that intercom up
and running.

03:42.700 --> 03:44.468
I need to talk to him
as soon as possible. Sir.

03:44.500 --> 03:46.600
This is Bauer.
Let me speak to Hastings.

03:52.967 --> 03:54.633
So, what have you got, Jack?

03:54.667 --> 03:56.234
JACK: It looks like our suspect
might be able to get

03:56.267 --> 03:57.633
the detonator working
before we can get to him.

03:57.667 --> 03:59.101
Owen will fill you in
on the details.

03:59.134 --> 04:00.700
Right now, I need to know
everything you've got on him.

04:00.734 --> 04:02.368
CHLOE: I'm just pulling up
the information now, Jack.

04:02.401 --> 04:05.401
It took a while to get it from
Hassan's intelligence people.

04:05.434 --> 04:06.867
Just give me
the overview.

04:06.900 --> 04:10.034
Okay, Marcos Al-Zacar
was born here,

04:10.067 --> 04:11.334
raised in East Harlem.

04:11.368 --> 04:14.034
Mother's American,
father was from the IRK-

04:14.067 --> 04:16.201
that's where Al-Zacar
got his politics from.

04:16.233 --> 04:18.632
His father was a professor
known to be highly critical

04:18.666 --> 04:20.401
of American
foreign policies,

04:20.434 --> 04:22.633
suspected of connections
with extremists.

04:22.667 --> 04:24.600
He was imprisoned by
Wayne Palmer's administration

04:24.633 --> 04:25.934
for four months.

04:25.967 --> 04:27.667
Although the charges
were eventually dropped,

04:27.700 --> 04:29.434
he was unhireable after that.

04:29.468 --> 04:32.301
Almost a year later,
he committed suicide.

04:32.334 --> 04:33.900
That must have been
what triggered Al-Zacar.

04:33.934 --> 04:35.134
He started spying

04:35.167 --> 04:37.667
on America for the IRK
two months after that.

04:37.700 --> 04:39.001
What about the mother?

04:39.034 --> 04:40.633
ARLO:
Checking current records.

04:40.667 --> 04:43.167
According to motor vehicle
and utility records

04:43.201 --> 04:44.301
she's still in East Harlem.

04:44.334 --> 04:46.468
4211 East 117th Street.

04:46.500 --> 04:48.434
Find her and get her here
as soon as possible.

04:48.468 --> 04:50.167
We're on it, Jack.
Keep us posted.

04:50.201 --> 04:52.234
Copy that.

04:52.267 --> 04:54.001
We have to assume the people
building this dirty bomb

04:54.034 --> 04:56.334
want to hit a high-value target
here in Manhattan.

04:56.368 --> 04:58.633
But first, they've got
to get it on the island.

04:58.667 --> 05:00.633
We should shut down the city?
No.

05:00.667 --> 05:02.101
We want them to make the attempt

05:02.134 --> 05:03.468
to move the radiological
materials.

05:03.500 --> 05:05.533
It's our best chance
of catching them.

05:05.567 --> 05:06.967
First, we have to make sure

05:07.001 --> 05:09.600
that all of our radiation
sensors are strictly monitored

05:09.633 --> 05:11.934
at all crossings.

05:11.967 --> 05:14.368
Arlo, that goes
for the drone sensors, too.

05:14.401 --> 05:15.633
ARLO:
Yes, sir.

05:15.667 --> 05:17.101
That's all.

05:30.401 --> 05:32.368
Cole?

05:32.401 --> 05:33.667
We went over this.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.667
All we have to do
is act natural.

05:35.700 --> 05:37.234
Keep our heads.

05:37.267 --> 05:39.134
You'll be okay.

05:39.167 --> 05:42.034
I am not worried about me.

05:42.067 --> 05:45.334
You can't really be this calm
after what just happened.

05:45.368 --> 05:48.034
You've never broken a law
in your life.

05:49.700 --> 05:52.468
Cole.

05:52.500 --> 05:53.900
What do you want me to say?

05:53.934 --> 05:56.301
I don't know! Anything.
Tell me you hate me.

05:56.334 --> 05:58.567
Tell me that you'll never
forgive me for lying to you.

05:58.600 --> 05:59.667
We're not doing this now.

05:59.700 --> 06:01.334
I told you to walk
away... Not now!

06:01.368 --> 06:03.067
We're in the middle

06:03.101 --> 06:04.500
of a radiological threat.

06:04.533 --> 06:06.368
We got jobs to do.

06:06.401 --> 06:09.234
When it's over,
then we'll talk.

06:16.667 --> 06:19.567
Look, I can't promise things are
going back to the way they were.

06:22.567 --> 06:25.034
But I wouldn't have done what I
did if I didn't still love you.

06:33.468 --> 06:36.633
You two have holy hell
to answer for.

06:36.667 --> 06:39.368
Sir, I'm sorry. I can
explain... Save it.

06:39.401 --> 06:41.167
If you were following up a lead,

06:41.201 --> 06:42.667
you should have been
updating me every 20 minutes.

06:42.700 --> 06:44.101
You broke protocol.

06:44.134 --> 06:46.267
The lead didn't pan out.
Witness proved to be unreliable.

06:46.301 --> 06:47.667
But you're right, sir,
there's no excuse.

06:47.700 --> 06:49.267
I should have called in.

06:49.301 --> 06:51.167
And you were supposed
to be servicing

06:51.201 --> 06:53.234
a faulty relay station.

06:53.267 --> 06:55.700
Yet I see you found time
to change your clothes.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.667
Look.

06:58.700 --> 07:00.401
I don't know what's going on
with you two

07:00.434 --> 07:01.567
and, frankly, I don't care.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.134
If we weren't
at high alert,

07:03.167 --> 07:05.234
and you weren't the best
at what you do,

07:05.267 --> 07:07.600
you'd both be out
on your asses for this.

07:07.633 --> 07:10.567
I'm going to ask you once.

07:10.600 --> 07:13.167
Whatever it is,
are you finished?

07:13.201 --> 07:14.600
Yes, sir.
Good.

07:14.633 --> 07:16.468
Walsh,
until further notice,

07:16.500 --> 07:18.267
you will answer
to Chloe O'Brian.

07:18.301 --> 07:20.267
She will fill you in
on what she needs from you.

07:20.301 --> 07:22.633
Bauer has a situation
at St. Julian's Hospital.

07:22.667 --> 07:24.633
I need you to assemble
a team, pick up

07:24.667 --> 07:27.034
an Elaine Al-Zacar
from East 117th

07:27.067 --> 07:28.500
and take her to him.

07:28.533 --> 07:30.567
Is she a hostile?
Unclear.

07:30.600 --> 07:33.167
Arlo will fill you in
on the details.

07:33.201 --> 07:34.633
Yes, sir.
How you perform

07:34.667 --> 07:36.500
from this point
will determine whether or not

07:36.533 --> 07:38.600
you salvage your careers.

07:38.633 --> 07:40.667
Now, get to work.

08:08.201 --> 08:11.101
(phone rings)

08:11.134 --> 08:12.934
Yes?

08:12.967 --> 08:14.967
I'm in place.

08:20.667 --> 08:23.633
I've managed to tap into
the hospital's security cameras.

08:23.667 --> 08:26.368
But we can only pick up audio
in the hallway outside the room.

08:26.401 --> 08:28.001
CTU has set up a
command center there.

08:28.034 --> 08:29.368
Can you see Marcos?

08:29.401 --> 08:32.167
Yes. He's still working
on the detonator.

08:32.201 --> 08:33.633
Are you able to gauge
his progress?

08:33.667 --> 08:36.234
He already has one of the
four circuits reconfigured.

08:36.267 --> 08:38.633
We're arriving
at the landing now.

08:38.667 --> 08:41.234
Soon we'll be able to transport
the rods into Manhattan.

08:41.267 --> 08:44.067
Are CTU's radiation
sensors down?

08:44.101 --> 08:45.633
Not yet.
But we'll be ready.

08:46.667 --> 08:48.633
Call me when Marcos is dead.

09:24.067 --> 09:26.134
Port Authority's
reporting no hits

09:26.167 --> 09:27.800
on the radiation sensors
at the Holland,

09:27.834 --> 09:29.534
Midtown and Lincoln Tunnels.

09:29.568 --> 09:32.067
I don't see any stream
updates for the GW,

09:32.101 --> 09:33.568
Brooklyn or Queens
crossings.

09:33.600 --> 09:34.700
What the problem?

09:34.733 --> 09:36.568
MTA's providing that feed

09:36.600 --> 09:38.600
on a dedicated sublink
to prevent a server overload.

09:38.633 --> 09:41.534
You can access it yourself
on the system's Ethernet port.

09:41.568 --> 09:43.167
So there's really no problem.

09:43.201 --> 09:44.900
There's no way I
could have known that

09:44.934 --> 09:46.967
since you didn't put
that in your hourlies.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.667
Right. I will do that next time.

09:58.434 --> 10:01.067
I know this must be hard
for you, having to report to me

10:01.101 --> 10:02.600
since you've been demoted.

10:02.633 --> 10:04.167
It's okay, Chloe,
I deserved it.

10:04.201 --> 10:05.934
Yeah, you did.

10:07.434 --> 10:10.468
I just want you to know
I'm actually glad you didn't get

10:10.501 --> 10:12.800
fired or anything and...

10:12.834 --> 10:14.201
Hang in there.

10:15.234 --> 10:17.167
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

10:27.534 --> 10:29.600
Where are we on
aerial detection?

10:29.633 --> 10:32.034
I've got drones covering
every inch of the waterfront

10:32.067 --> 10:34.468
with their radiation
detectors cranked up.

10:34.501 --> 10:36.201
If they try to bring
the fuel rods

10:36.234 --> 10:38.000
into the city by boat,
we'll spot them.

10:38.034 --> 10:39.501
Easily.

10:41.534 --> 10:44.167
Look, I know you probably
hate my guts right now,

10:44.201 --> 10:46.667
but I just wanted you to know
that I'm sorry.

10:48.867 --> 10:51.534
For telling Cole
about you and that other guy.

10:51.568 --> 10:53.867
I mean,
you were definitely

10:53.900 --> 10:56.234
messing up, and with the threat
of those rods out there...

10:56.267 --> 10:58.234
Don't worry about it, Arlo.

10:59.267 --> 11:01.501
So is he gone?

11:01.534 --> 11:03.867
Who?

11:03.900 --> 11:05.167
You know.

11:05.201 --> 11:06.401
The other guy.

11:06.434 --> 11:08.900
Yeah.

11:08.934 --> 11:10.167
Yeah, he's gone.

11:11.434 --> 11:13.834
So, you and the Boy Scout
are okay?

11:13.867 --> 11:16.167
We'll get through it.

11:17.201 --> 11:19.834
I'm glad.

11:19.867 --> 11:21.101
But if for some reason

11:21.134 --> 11:22.434
that changes...
I know.

11:22.468 --> 11:24.568
Meaning, if you ever decide
you want to trade up...

11:24.600 --> 11:26.468
I got it.

11:51.468 --> 11:53.134
Sir, we got the intercom
to the chamber working.

11:53.167 --> 11:54.568
You should be able
to talk to the suspect.

11:54.633 --> 11:57.633
Good. Tell CTU I'll keep
my comm up so they can monitor.

11:57.667 --> 11:58.667
Yes, sir.

12:19.434 --> 12:21.167
(over intercom):
Marcos, my name is Jack Bauer.

12:21.201 --> 12:22.633
I'm working with CTU.

12:22.667 --> 12:25.000
I know the original
plan was

12:25.034 --> 12:27.468
to smuggle the fuel rods back
to the IRK to reconstitute

12:27.501 --> 12:29.201
their nuclear program.

12:29.234 --> 12:31.101
So I'm just guessing

12:31.134 --> 12:33.201
that helping to deliver
a dirty bomb to New York City

12:33.234 --> 12:35.000
which will cost the lives
of tens of thousands

12:35.034 --> 12:37.767
of innocent people isn't
exactly what you signed on for.

12:37.800 --> 12:41.434
But the truth is if you do this,
you'll be killing the IRK.

12:41.468 --> 12:43.534
By bombing New York City,
you're going to force

12:43.568 --> 12:46.633
President Taylor to retaliate,
and she will, hard.

12:46.667 --> 12:49.667
You can't possibly want that.

12:49.700 --> 12:51.201
It doesn't matter what I want.

12:51.234 --> 12:53.568
This so-called peace agreement,
it's just Hassan

12:53.600 --> 12:56.000
signing away my country's
ability to defend itself,

12:56.034 --> 12:58.201
its independence.

12:58.234 --> 13:00.034
He's surrendering
without a fight.

13:00.067 --> 13:02.167
But there are a lot of people
in his own government

13:02.201 --> 13:04.000
who are not willing to do that.

13:04.034 --> 13:06.700
Marcos, you can't
win this fight.

13:06.733 --> 13:10.167
The IRK will sustain massive
casualties because of this.

13:10.201 --> 13:11.633
Because of you.

13:11.667 --> 13:13.401
Not because of me.

13:13.434 --> 13:15.834
America will be the one
dropping all the bombs.

13:15.867 --> 13:17.534
No, son.

13:17.568 --> 13:19.167
The eyes of the world
will hold you responsible

13:19.201 --> 13:21.134
for the innocent lives taken
in New York City.

13:22.667 --> 13:25.534
No, don't think you can take
the moral high ground with me.

13:25.568 --> 13:28.134
The arrogance
of this country.

13:28.167 --> 13:30.600
That it feels it can dictate
to the rest of the world

13:30.633 --> 13:33.534
who gets... who gets to
have nuclear weapons,

13:33.568 --> 13:36.934
while it insists on keeping
my people in the Dark Ages.

13:36.967 --> 13:38.934
You keep saying
"your people, your country."

13:38.967 --> 13:40.201
Marcos, I read your file.

13:40.234 --> 13:42.101
You were born here.
You're an American citizen.

13:42.134 --> 13:43.633
Your father is from the IRK.

13:43.667 --> 13:45.201
You leave my father
out of this!

13:45.234 --> 13:47.534
What happened to your
father was unfair and tragic,

13:47.568 --> 13:49.600
but this is no way
to honor his memory.

13:49.633 --> 13:51.600
Please, you can still do
the right thing here.

13:51.633 --> 13:53.201
You can help me stop this
from happening.

13:53.234 --> 13:55.534
All you have to do
is open the door.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.000
Please, I'm begging you.

13:57.034 --> 14:00.134
You're not going to get
me to change my mind.

14:00.167 --> 14:04.867
I came here
prepared to die.

14:04.900 --> 14:07.034
And that's what's
going to happen.

14:09.101 --> 14:11.434
Marcos.

14:13.201 --> 14:15.101
Marcos.

14:15.134 --> 14:16.867
Please, just talk to me.

14:19.800 --> 14:21.434
Marcos!

14:27.600 --> 14:29.600
Marcos!

14:48.834 --> 14:51.368
Yes, of course.
I understand.

14:52.417 --> 14:53.850
We'll see you soon.

14:53.883 --> 14:55.050
Thank you.

14:57.117 --> 14:58.984
Your friend
at the State Department-

14:59.017 --> 15:00.750
you trust he can do
what he says,

15:00.783 --> 15:02.651
give us asylum?

15:02.684 --> 15:04.351
Yes.

15:04.384 --> 15:06.984
He says with what your
father has been doing-

15:07.017 --> 15:10.451
ordering unlawful
arrest and torture-

15:10.484 --> 15:13.150
U.S. law will consider
us political refugees.

15:14.718 --> 15:16.850
But you have
to understand,

15:16.883 --> 15:19.417
asylum will not be
granted overnight.

15:19.451 --> 15:21.551
Well, how long
are we talking about?

15:21.584 --> 15:24.451
A year, maybe 18 months.

15:24.484 --> 15:26.783
But as soon as we
file the application,

15:26.817 --> 15:28.084
we are protected
by the law.

15:28.117 --> 15:29.783
Your father
cannot touch us.

15:31.883 --> 15:34.084
You know that I will not
be able to work here legally

15:34.117 --> 15:36.984
until asylum
has been granted.

15:37.017 --> 15:39.950
I have some savings.

15:39.984 --> 15:42.351
But I will not be able

15:42.384 --> 15:45.017
to give you the life that
you have been used to.

15:45.050 --> 15:48.017
Oh, you know I don't care
about any of that.

15:56.718 --> 15:58.984
(phone rings)
(moans) One minute.

16:00.718 --> 16:03.817
Oh... my mother again.

16:05.050 --> 16:07.017
I really should answer it.
Kayla.

16:07.050 --> 16:09.150
No, she deserves to know
I'm all right.

16:10.984 --> 16:12.384
Give that back to me!

16:12.417 --> 16:15.150
Please. You know
what? You can call her

16:15.184 --> 16:18.618
when the lawyer has
filed the application.

16:18.651 --> 16:20.150
We must wait until then.

16:20.184 --> 16:22.084
(groans)
Bye-bye.

16:24.184 --> 16:26.551
Kayla, it's me again.

16:26.584 --> 16:28.117
Darling, I need to talk to you.

16:28.150 --> 16:29.750
Your father told me
something terrible

16:29.783 --> 16:31.718
may be happening here
in New York.

16:31.750 --> 16:33.150
Please, call me back
as soon as you

16:33.184 --> 16:35.017
get this message.

16:43.184 --> 16:44.551
I still can't reach her.

16:44.584 --> 16:46.150
Thank you for
coming back.

16:46.184 --> 16:47.718
Our daughter is missing.

16:47.750 --> 16:49.484
I'm not leaving until
I know she's all right.

16:49.517 --> 16:50.850
We'll find her, Dalia.

16:53.050 --> 16:55.551
Nabeel told me
you had Tarin arrested.

16:57.718 --> 17:00.351
I didn't know
who I could trust.

17:00.384 --> 17:04.117
So you started arresting people
from inside your own delegation?

17:05.718 --> 17:08.451
What possible evidence could you
have gathered so quickly?

17:08.483 --> 17:10.451
I had to do something.
But Tarin?

17:11.916 --> 17:14.084
He's one of your most loyal men.

17:14.117 --> 17:16.684
So was my brother.

17:16.718 --> 17:18.384
Or so I thought.

17:18.416 --> 17:20.317
Until he tried

17:20.351 --> 17:22.684
to have me killed
and destroy my government.

17:22.718 --> 17:24.384
If you continue to act
the way you have been,

17:24.416 --> 17:26.517
you will have done the job
for him.

17:29.917 --> 17:31.917
Have you told the police?

17:31.950 --> 17:33.984
I've been trying to deal
with it on my own.

17:34.017 --> 17:36.150
But it's time
to get them involved.

17:58.783 --> 18:00.651
Dalia, I'm sorry.

18:00.684 --> 18:01.950
As you should be!

18:01.984 --> 18:03.618
This city is under attack!

18:03.651 --> 18:05.783
Our daughter is god knows where!

18:07.517 --> 18:10.783
You drove her away
with your suspicion

18:10.817 --> 18:12.883
and your paranoia!

18:14.917 --> 18:17.950
(cries):
How could you, Omar?

18:19.517 --> 18:22.783
How could you
have lost your way?

18:25.850 --> 18:28.084
Dalia.

18:28.117 --> 18:29.950
You're right.

18:29.984 --> 18:32.117
I have.

18:32.150 --> 18:34.917
I have. I see that now.

18:36.384 --> 18:38.351
And I'll make changes.

18:39.551 --> 18:41.150
I'll do everything in my power

18:41.883 --> 18:43.451
to find her.

18:44.517 --> 18:46.984
And get her safe.

18:48.017 --> 18:50.150
You have my word.

18:51.718 --> 18:53.718
I am sorry.

18:55.150 --> 18:57.050
(whispers):
Dalia, I'm sorry.

19:09.684 --> 19:11.651
(knocking on door)

19:14.351 --> 19:15.984
(knocking)

19:17.783 --> 19:18.917
Who is it?

19:18.950 --> 19:20.917
Elaine Al-Zacar?

19:20.950 --> 19:22.084
What do you want?

19:22.117 --> 19:23.417
My name is Cole Ortiz.

19:23.451 --> 19:24.750
I'm an agent with CTU.

19:24.783 --> 19:26.651
I need you to open
that door, ma'am.

19:26.684 --> 19:28.317
I don't understand.
What's this about?

19:28.351 --> 19:29.917
Your son, Marcos.

19:29.950 --> 19:31.251
Marcos?

19:31.284 --> 19:32.883
Ma'am, you're either
going to open that door

19:32.917 --> 19:34.718
or I'm gonna break
it down. Now!

19:35.783 --> 19:38.017
Go!
(shrieks)

19:39.817 --> 19:41.384
(exclaims)

19:41.417 --> 19:44.017
Mrs. Al-Zacar, are you aware
of where your son is right now?

19:44.050 --> 19:46.050
Not at the moment.
How much do you know

19:46.084 --> 19:47.384
about his activities on behalf

19:47.417 --> 19:49.750
of the IRK?
Uh...

19:50.917 --> 19:52.517
I know that he

19:52.551 --> 19:54.817
communicates with family there,
if that's what you mean.

19:58.050 --> 19:59.417
You going somewhere?

19:59.451 --> 20:02.783
I was just about to leave
to my sister's house.

20:02.817 --> 20:03.984
You do that a lot, take trips

20:04.017 --> 20:05.684
to visit relatives
at 2:30 in the morning?

20:05.718 --> 20:07.850
No, I don't.
I can explain.

20:07.883 --> 20:10.883
Marcos called me
about an hour ago.

20:10.917 --> 20:12.817
He told me to leave the city.

20:12.850 --> 20:14.484
He said he needed me to meet him

20:14.517 --> 20:16.783
at my sister's house
in Pennsylvania.

20:16.817 --> 20:18.817
He didn't tell you
anything else? No.

20:19.850 --> 20:21.950
I swear.

20:21.984 --> 20:23.551
Ma'am, right now your son's

20:23.584 --> 20:25.084
barricaded himself
at St. Julian's Hospital,

20:25.117 --> 20:27.850
trying to blow himself up
with a suicide vest.

20:27.883 --> 20:30.150
Oh, my God. No!

20:30.184 --> 20:32.084
I need you to come with me
to St. Julian's- ma'am.

20:32.117 --> 20:34.750
We don't know how much longer we
have till your son can activate

20:34.783 --> 20:36.384
the explosives;
we have to go.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.434
(knocking on glass)
Yes?

20:53.434 --> 20:55.068
Sir, Cole just checked in.

20:55.101 --> 20:56.701
He's got Al-Zacar's mother
and he's en route

20:56.734 --> 20:58.333
to St. Julian's now.
What's his ETA?

20:58.367 --> 21:00.168
Less than ten minutes.

21:00.200 --> 21:02.200
All right, then. Thank you.

21:02.233 --> 21:05.101
Sir, I would like
to apologize again

21:05.134 --> 21:07.333
for leaving my post.
I know that I let you down.

21:09.034 --> 21:11.134
Yes, you did.

21:11.168 --> 21:14.333
I brought you in
and gave you this promotion

21:14.367 --> 21:16.333
because I saw something in you,
not just your skill,

21:16.367 --> 21:19.333
which is considerable.

21:19.367 --> 21:23.034
But an ability to adapt
to any situation,

21:23.068 --> 21:24.901
drive to be better,

21:24.934 --> 21:26.367
attributes that make you
a good leader.

21:26.400 --> 21:27.834
Or did I misread that?

21:27.867 --> 21:29.701
No, sir.

21:29.734 --> 21:31.367
So we can chalk up
the last several hours

21:31.400 --> 21:33.367
to a serious lapse in judgment?

21:33.400 --> 21:35.367
What I was...
Look.

21:35.400 --> 21:38.134
I don't want to lose
you or Cole.

21:38.168 --> 21:40.701
You're both valuable,

21:40.734 --> 21:42.267
but everyone is replaceable.

21:42.300 --> 21:44.367
I screwed up
and I'm willing

21:44.400 --> 21:45.734
to accept the consequences.

21:45.767 --> 21:48.168
I know that Cole
feels the same way.

21:52.367 --> 21:53.867
Thank you, sir.

21:58.034 --> 21:59.300
Hello?

21:59.333 --> 22:00.801
MAN:
Can I ask who I'm speaking with?

22:00.834 --> 22:02.233
Excuse me?

22:02.267 --> 22:04.233
Would you mind telling me
your name, please?

22:04.267 --> 22:06.101
This is Dana Walsh. Who is this?

22:06.134 --> 22:10.001
Forgive me, Miss Walsh, for
calling at this ungodly hour.

22:10.034 --> 22:12.233
I actually expected
to leave a message.

22:12.267 --> 22:13.701
I'm sorry if I woke you.

22:13.734 --> 22:16.134
No, no, that's okay.
I'm actually at work.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.701
What is this regarding?

22:17.734 --> 22:20.300
Well, my name's Prady. I'm with
the Department of Corrections

22:20.333 --> 22:21.801
down in Little Rock.

22:21.834 --> 22:23.600
I'm trying to locate
an individual

22:23.634 --> 22:26.734
by the name of Kevin Wade.

22:28.834 --> 22:29.967
I- I'm sorry.

22:30.001 --> 22:31.967
Who did you say
that you were again?

22:32.001 --> 22:34.300
Bill Prady.
I'm a probation officer.

22:34.333 --> 22:35.734
Mr. Wade is one of my charges.

22:35.767 --> 22:37.233
Do you know him?

22:37.267 --> 22:39.701
No, no.
I don't think that I do.

22:39.734 --> 22:41.901
Well, that's peculiar
since he dialed this number

22:41.934 --> 22:45.333
a few days ago from a
motel room in Queens.

22:45.367 --> 22:46.734
Probably just
a misdial.

22:46.767 --> 22:49.233
No. Dialed this
number more than once,

22:49.267 --> 22:52.001
and some of the calls lasted
more than a couple of minutes.

22:52.034 --> 22:53.634
Look, Mr. Prady, I am
really busy right now.

22:53.667 --> 22:56.867
I work for CTU and we are
in the middle of a crisis.

22:56.901 --> 22:59.101
Well, I completely understand.
I've heard the news.

22:59.134 --> 23:00.300
But since we're both awake,

23:00.333 --> 23:03.934
I wonder if I could
meet with you in person.

23:03.967 --> 23:05.400
You mean now?

23:05.434 --> 23:08.300
Well, I got an early flight to
Little Rock in the morning,

23:08.333 --> 23:10.567
so, yeah, it'd pretty much
have to be now, ma'am.

23:10.600 --> 23:13.168
I'm sorry.
I- I don't really understand

23:13.200 --> 23:14.867
why this is so pressing.

23:14.901 --> 23:17.300
Well, Miss Walsh,
I've grown kind of fond

23:17.333 --> 23:20.801
of young Kevin, and the longer
it takes me to find him,

23:20.834 --> 23:23.300
the harder it'll be for me

23:23.333 --> 23:24.967
to keep him from
going back into prison.

23:25.001 --> 23:27.068
I don't really see
how I can be of any help.

23:27.101 --> 23:28.801
Yeah, well, maybe not.

23:28.834 --> 23:30.734
But we can determine that
when we speak.

23:30.767 --> 23:33.068
Like I said,
it won't take long.

23:35.367 --> 23:37.767
Look, if it'll
smooth things over,

23:37.801 --> 23:39.300
I could call
your supervisor.

23:39.333 --> 23:41.767
No, no.
That won't be necessary.

23:41.801 --> 23:44.168
I'm sure that I could spare
a few minutes for you.

23:44.200 --> 23:46.034
Thank you, ma'am.
That would be super.

23:46.068 --> 23:48.233
Tell you what.
Let me just pull over,

23:48.267 --> 23:50.001
and I'll get your address.
All right?

23:51.934 --> 23:53.634
Of course.

23:53.667 --> 23:56.101
(breathing heavily)

24:13.600 --> 24:15.867
Sir, according to the
bomb techs, he's close.

24:15.901 --> 24:17.567
Getting that third circuit
active was the toughest part.

24:17.600 --> 24:20.168
The fourth is only a matter of
rerouting the firing circuits.

24:20.200 --> 24:21.300
What's the time frame?

24:21.333 --> 24:22.767
Ten minutes, maybe less.

24:22.801 --> 24:24.701
How much longer is it going
to take them to drill through?

24:24.734 --> 24:26.300
Too long.
They're not going to make it.

24:26.333 --> 24:28.300
Get her some water.

24:29.333 --> 24:31.300
Take care of that.

24:34.168 --> 24:35.300
Did she resist?

24:35.333 --> 24:37.001
Not once I told her
her boy had explosives

24:37.034 --> 24:38.667
strapped to him and was
going to blow himself up.

24:38.701 --> 24:41.034
She had a packed suitcase, Jack.

24:43.600 --> 24:44.767
So he cares enough about her

24:44.801 --> 24:46.867
to make sure
she got out of town.

24:46.901 --> 24:48.034
What else does she know?

24:48.068 --> 24:49.233
Nothing, as far
as I can tell.

24:49.267 --> 24:50.233
And I didn't tell
her anything more.

24:50.267 --> 24:51.934
Okay, good.

24:56.168 --> 24:57.734
Mrs. Al-Zacar,
my name is Jack Bauer.

24:57.767 --> 24:59.200
I'm in charge of
field operations here.

24:59.233 --> 25:00.567
Where is he? I'm going
to take you to him.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.233
I want to see him.
I'm going to take you to him.

25:02.267 --> 25:04.901
Please sit down. I need you to
fully understand the situation.

25:04.934 --> 25:07.168
Please.

25:07.200 --> 25:09.001
(phone rings)

25:09.034 --> 25:10.801
(sighs)

25:10.834 --> 25:13.233
This is Ortiz.

25:13.267 --> 25:14.801
Cole, it's me.

25:14.834 --> 25:17.300
Kevin's probation officer
just called me.

25:17.333 --> 25:20.034
He's in New York,
trying to track down Kevin.

25:20.068 --> 25:21.300
I can't talk to you
about this now.

25:21.333 --> 25:22.767
We're in the middle here.

25:22.801 --> 25:25.567
Listen to me. I told him I
didn't know who Kevin was,

25:25.600 --> 25:28.300
but... he caught me in the lie.

25:28.333 --> 25:32.767
He has records that show him
calling my cell several times.

25:34.333 --> 25:38.934
Cole, this probation officer
is on his way here.

25:38.967 --> 25:40.567
Look, you're going to have
to figure out a reason

25:40.600 --> 25:41.767
why he had your number.

25:41.801 --> 25:44.233
I don't know if I can do this.

25:44.267 --> 25:46.600
What, lie? Come on,
we both know you're good at it.

25:47.701 --> 25:49.333
Sorry.

25:49.367 --> 25:51.701
Look, you just have
to handle this. Okay?

25:51.734 --> 25:53.134
All right?

25:53.168 --> 25:54.667
Yeah.

25:54.701 --> 25:55.867
Let me know what happens.

25:55.901 --> 25:57.068
I got to go.

26:01.834 --> 26:03.267
I can't believe
this is happening.

26:03.300 --> 26:04.634
You need to believe it.

26:04.667 --> 26:06.168
The men your son
is working with

26:06.200 --> 26:07.934
intend on detonating
a radiological bomb

26:07.967 --> 26:09.267
somewhere in Manhattan.

26:09.300 --> 26:11.034
That's why your son tried
to get you out of the city.

26:11.068 --> 26:12.200
(groans)

26:12.233 --> 26:14.134
Marcos has been
an agent for the IRK,

26:14.168 --> 26:15.801
spying on this country
since your husband died.

26:15.834 --> 26:18.233
We have proof of that.

26:18.267 --> 26:19.267
And now he's going
to kill himself

26:19.300 --> 26:20.734
in order to protect this plot

26:20.767 --> 26:22.534
unless you can
convince him otherwise.

26:22.567 --> 26:25.300
What do-what do I say to him?

26:25.333 --> 26:26.767
Whatever you have to,

26:26.801 --> 26:29.634
to get him to stop rearming
that vest, and open the door.

26:29.667 --> 26:31.300
We need him
to open the door.

26:31.333 --> 26:32.701
Do you understand?

26:34.333 --> 26:38.168
If he does that,

26:38.200 --> 26:40.200
then what happens to him?

26:40.233 --> 26:42.001
He'll be alive.

26:42.034 --> 26:44.300
If he cooperates with us,
I promise you,

26:44.333 --> 26:46.034
I will do everything
I can to help him.

26:46.068 --> 26:47.634
I give you my word.

26:50.333 --> 26:53.600
Ma'am, I'm sorry,
but we need to do this now.

27:08.168 --> 27:09.667
We need the room.

27:09.701 --> 27:12.200
Now.

27:21.901 --> 27:23.734
It's definitely her.

27:23.767 --> 27:25.267
Marcos's mother.

27:25.300 --> 27:27.068
You recruited him, Ali.

27:27.101 --> 27:28.267
You know him better than anyone.

27:28.300 --> 27:30.300
Will she be able
to talk him down?

27:30.333 --> 27:32.834
He's loyal to
our country.

27:32.867 --> 27:34.101
I don't think so.

27:41.068 --> 27:43.567
ELAINE (over intercom):
Marcos?

27:45.901 --> 27:49.200
Marcos, it's me.

27:51.267 --> 27:53.101
Mom, what are you doing here?

27:53.134 --> 27:54.934
Marcos, you have to stop this.

27:54.967 --> 27:56.667
This is crazy.

27:56.701 --> 27:58.767
You son of a bitch!

27:58.801 --> 28:01.267
Leave us alone!

28:01.300 --> 28:03.233
You leave us alone!

28:08.600 --> 28:11.134
Marcos, talk to me.

28:11.168 --> 28:13.867
Oh, my God, Mom. I told you
to get out of the city.

28:13.901 --> 28:15.233
I told you to go
to Aunt Shelley's.

28:15.267 --> 28:16.734
Why didn't you listen to me?

28:16.767 --> 28:18.267
I'm listening now.

28:18.300 --> 28:19.967
You told me that you were going
to meet me there.

28:20.001 --> 28:21.134
I believed you.

28:21.168 --> 28:22.867
I was trying to protect you.

28:22.901 --> 28:24.867
From a terrorist attack?

28:24.901 --> 28:28.801
That's what they say
that you're involved in here.

28:28.834 --> 28:31.267
Something that's going
to kill many, many people.

28:31.300 --> 28:33.667
Marcos, tell me that's not true!

28:35.001 --> 28:38.834
Tell me!

28:38.867 --> 28:40.734
Marcos, why?

28:40.767 --> 28:43.034
You ask me that?

28:43.068 --> 28:45.667
After what this
country did to Dad?

28:47.600 --> 28:49.634
(sighs)

28:49.667 --> 28:52.701
Marcos, I loved your father.
You know I did.

28:55.267 --> 28:56.701
But he was a complicated man,

28:56.734 --> 28:58.967
and especially when it came
to his politics.

29:00.333 --> 29:03.068
But he never condoned
violence of any kind, Marcos.

29:03.101 --> 29:04.233
Never.

29:04.267 --> 29:06.901
He would agree with
what we're doing.

29:06.934 --> 29:09.534
You really think that?

29:09.567 --> 29:11.267
He hated America.

29:11.300 --> 29:12.834
And yet he came to America.

29:12.867 --> 29:14.200
He married an American.

29:14.233 --> 29:16.534
He had an American son.

29:18.300 --> 29:22.134
Honey, nothing is as simple
as you're making it out to be.

29:22.168 --> 29:24.267
CHLOE:
Mr. Hastings.

29:24.300 --> 29:26.600
I've registered a 12%
degradation in the hospital's

29:26.634 --> 29:28.134
security feed.

29:28.168 --> 29:29.233
Can you boost the signal?

29:29.267 --> 29:30.634
You're missing
the point.

29:30.667 --> 29:33.101
The indications are someone's
tapped into the feed.

29:33.134 --> 29:36.300
They can see
everything we can.

29:39.001 --> 29:40.267
I wish I'd done more.

29:40.300 --> 29:43.801
I wish I'd helped you

29:43.834 --> 29:47.701
deal with your grief
and with your anger.

29:47.734 --> 29:49.934
No, don't put
this on yourself.

29:49.967 --> 29:51.600
(sobbing)

29:51.634 --> 29:53.767
You couldn't have
done any more

29:53.801 --> 29:55.801
or been a better mother.

29:57.034 --> 29:59.300
She's almost got him.

29:59.333 --> 30:01.534
CHLOE (over comm):
Jack, do you copy?

30:01.567 --> 30:03.300
Yeah, Chloe. Go ahead.

30:03.333 --> 30:05.034
The video feed
has been compromised.

30:05.068 --> 30:06.333
You're being surveilled.

30:08.001 --> 30:10.300
Copy that. I'll take care
of it from here.

30:10.333 --> 30:12.134
Owen, how long will it take
to disconnect the video system?

30:12.168 --> 30:13.300
30 seconds.

30:13.333 --> 30:14.867
Get on it.
What's going on, Jack?

30:14.901 --> 30:16.600
Someone else is watching.

30:16.634 --> 30:19.101
Mom...

30:19.134 --> 30:23.333
I know what they want you to do.

30:23.367 --> 30:25.333
But it's too late for that.

30:25.367 --> 30:26.333
Don't say that.

30:26.367 --> 30:28.767
You can still turn yourself in.

30:28.801 --> 30:31.333
We'll hire the best lawyers,
whatever it takes.

30:31.367 --> 30:32.901
I'll be with you
every step of the way.

30:32.934 --> 30:34.101
I promise that.

30:34.134 --> 30:36.701
I'm sorry.

30:36.734 --> 30:39.333
(sobbing)

30:39.367 --> 30:42.333
Marcos, I'm-I'm begging you.

30:42.367 --> 30:45.333
Mom, listen to me.

30:45.367 --> 30:47.634
You got to be strong now.

30:47.667 --> 30:49.233
Damn it. No.
Marcos.

30:49.267 --> 30:50.767
Marcos,

30:50.801 --> 30:53.200
please. You're all I have.

30:53.233 --> 30:55.300
Please don't do this.

30:55.333 --> 30:58.300
I love you so much.

30:58.333 --> 31:00.034
I'm sorry. It's over.
Get her out of there.

31:00.068 --> 31:02.134
I'm sorry.
Now! Move!

31:02.168 --> 31:04.300
Marcos, No! No!

31:04.333 --> 31:07.200
No! Marcos, no!

31:07.233 --> 31:09.300
No! No!

31:25.367 --> 31:27.233
Samir, I just lost picture.

31:27.267 --> 31:28.634
Is his mother
still in the room?

31:30.600 --> 31:33.300
No, but he's still in there
with one of the agents.

31:45.200 --> 31:46.934
You detonate that vest,

31:46.967 --> 31:48.934
your mother dies, too.

31:52.667 --> 31:54.767
What did you say?

31:54.801 --> 31:56.867
You heard me.

31:56.901 --> 31:58.801
I'm going to make sure
your mother's in Manhattan

31:58.834 --> 32:00.600
when that dirty bomb goes off.

32:00.634 --> 32:02.667
You don't even know
what the target is.

32:02.701 --> 32:05.300
I'm not talking about her
dying during the explosion.

32:05.333 --> 32:07.567
I'm going to personally
escort her to the blast site,

32:07.600 --> 32:09.767
so she's exposed
to the radiation.

32:09.801 --> 32:11.834
I don't believe you.

32:11.867 --> 32:14.667
you wouldn't do that.
You're a federal agent.

32:14.701 --> 32:16.534
Truth is, I'm not, really.

32:16.567 --> 32:18.001
Well, not anymore.

32:18.034 --> 32:21.267
I'm more of a specialist
that they brought in for today.

32:21.300 --> 32:23.567
If you knew who I was,

32:23.600 --> 32:26.300
and things I've done
before in my life,

32:26.333 --> 32:28.333
you would know
that I'm not bluffing.

32:28.367 --> 32:30.134
So, go ahead.

32:30.168 --> 32:32.367
Blow yourself up
into a million pieces.

32:32.400 --> 32:33.667
First thing I'm going
to do is I'm going

32:33.701 --> 32:35.333
to make your mother
come in here and clean it up.

32:35.367 --> 32:39.333
And then I'm going to take her
to the blast site.

32:39.367 --> 32:41.300
Do you know how long
it takes a human body

32:41.333 --> 32:44.001
to absorb a lethal dose
of cesium 137?

32:44.034 --> 32:45.333
Five seconds.

32:45.367 --> 32:47.333
Followed by 12 days of pain

32:47.367 --> 32:50.867
that's so agonizing,
morphine can't even touch it.

32:54.300 --> 32:56.934
You got a decision to make.

32:56.967 --> 33:00.300
Make it carefully.

33:02.967 --> 33:05.600
You're not gonna hurt my mother.

33:05.634 --> 33:08.500
I am done playing with you.

33:08.534 --> 33:10.168
You look into my eyes.

33:18.400 --> 33:21.434
Look in my eyes!

33:21.467 --> 33:23.801
You think I'm joking.

33:25.101 --> 33:28.267
What happens to your mother
is because of you.

33:28.300 --> 33:30.667
Only you.

33:30.701 --> 33:33.767
(sniffles)

33:37.233 --> 33:38.834
(sniffles)

33:40.267 --> 33:43.667
If I open the door
and I come out,

33:43.701 --> 33:48.367
(sobbing): you promise
you won't hurt her?

33:48.400 --> 33:51.534
You promise
you'll leave her alone?

33:52.600 --> 33:55.267
I give you my word.

33:55.300 --> 33:56.901
(groaning loudly)

34:07.934 --> 34:10.034
(groans)

34:11.634 --> 34:14.500
Cole, I've got some action
on the door.

34:14.534 --> 34:15.833
(groaning)

34:27.168 --> 34:28.701
Put your hands up now!

34:28.734 --> 34:31.567
Walk towards me! Move!

34:31.600 --> 34:32.634
Down on your knees!

34:32.667 --> 34:34.667
Put your hands
behind your head

34:34.701 --> 34:37.266
and interlock
your fingers!

34:37.300 --> 34:39.434
Don't you move!

34:39.467 --> 34:40.701
Cole, I got four lights on.

34:40.734 --> 34:42.199
Damn it!

34:42.233 --> 34:43.500
Cole, I got four lights on!

34:43.534 --> 34:44.600
COLE:
We need bomb techs now.

34:44.634 --> 34:45.833
The suspect's come out
of the chamber,

34:45.867 --> 34:47.168
but he's managed
to arm the vest.

34:47.199 --> 34:48.367
I repeat: he has armed the vest.

34:48.400 --> 34:50.867
We need bomb techs here
to disable it now!

34:53.534 --> 34:54.967
Samir, Marcos is out
of the chamber.

34:55.001 --> 34:56.801
What?! They must have
talked him out it,

34:56.833 --> 34:58.567
but he's rearmed the vest.

34:58.600 --> 35:00.367
You're sure? He's
still wearing it?

35:00.400 --> 35:01.500
Yes, I think so.

35:01.534 --> 35:03.434
Hang up right now
and transmit the fail-safe.

35:03.467 --> 35:04.534
Let's move!

35:04.567 --> 35:06.068
Keep you men back!

35:06.101 --> 35:07.867
I know the circuit pattern!

35:07.901 --> 35:09.333
I'm looking for four
common leads

35:09.367 --> 35:11.500
before I can disarm it.

35:11.534 --> 35:13.467
(typing)

35:18.467 --> 35:20.434
What's happening?!
What is that?!

35:22.467 --> 35:23.867
Cole, they must have triggerd
a fail-safe.

35:23.901 --> 35:25.001
Get you men back now.

35:25.034 --> 35:26.001
Move! Move! Move!

35:26.034 --> 35:27.534
Get this off of me!

35:27.567 --> 35:29.367
I'm gonna try!
Just stay calm!

35:29.400 --> 35:31.168
Mom!

35:31.200 --> 35:33.034
Get her out of here now!

35:35.467 --> 35:38.367
Marcos, I might not be able
to do this in time.

35:38.400 --> 35:39.934
I need to know
what the target is.

35:39.967 --> 35:41.667
I don't know.
How are they

35:41.701 --> 35:42.901
gonna smuggle
the fuel rods into the city

35:42.934 --> 35:44.168
past the radiological detectors?

35:44.200 --> 35:45.333
I don't know, I swear!

35:45.367 --> 35:47.701
Who does?!

35:47.734 --> 35:49.367
Give me a name.

35:49.400 --> 35:51.801
Damn it, Marcos,
give me a name!

35:51.834 --> 35:54.801
President Hassan's
head of security Tarin Faroush!

35:54.834 --> 35:56.934
Tarin Faroush.
Did you get that, Cole?

35:56.967 --> 35:58.434
Copy!
Come on.

35:58.467 --> 36:01.267
Come on. Come on.

36:01.300 --> 36:04.101
One more.
(panting)

36:04.134 --> 36:08.034
I'm not gonna be able
to do this in time.

36:08.068 --> 36:10.600
You tell my mother I'm sorry.

36:11.967 --> 36:13.101
(both grunt)

36:13.134 --> 36:14.134
(yells)

36:15.934 --> 36:19.034
(pained grunting)

36:19.068 --> 36:20.600
Jack? Jack, do you copy?

36:20.634 --> 36:23.101
(grunting)

36:28.801 --> 36:30.667
CTU, this is Jack.

36:30.701 --> 36:32.801
Marcos is dead.

36:32.834 --> 36:35.534
I'm gonna need to speak
to President Hassan.

36:35.567 --> 36:37.367
(groans)

36:44.400 --> 36:47.367
Commissioner, I appreciate
that your NYPD's overburdened,

36:47.400 --> 36:49.901
but I would ask you to do
whatever you can

36:49.934 --> 36:52.600
to have my daughter's picture
circulated.

36:52.634 --> 36:54.201
Please keep me posted

36:54.234 --> 36:57.333
if you get any information
regarding her whereabouts.

36:57.367 --> 36:59.168
Yes.

36:59.201 --> 37:01.168
Thank you.

37:01.201 --> 37:03.867
(knocking on door)

37:05.067 --> 37:08.101
Sir, CTU is routing a call
to you.

37:08.134 --> 37:09.001
From whom?

37:09.034 --> 37:10.300
Jack Bauer.

37:14.201 --> 37:16.168
(door closes)

37:16.201 --> 37:19.067
Yes, Mr. Bauer?
This is President Hassan.

37:19.101 --> 37:21.234
Mr. President,
I was told you were briefed

37:21.268 --> 37:23.067
on the situation
at St. Julian's Hospital.

37:23.101 --> 37:24.101
I was.

37:24.134 --> 37:26.534
Sir, the suicide bomber
is dead.

37:26.567 --> 37:28.234
His explosive vest
was remotely detonated.

37:28.268 --> 37:29.734
Then you have no leads.

37:29.767 --> 37:31.134
No, sir, we actually do.

37:31.168 --> 37:32.567
Before the suspect
was killed,

37:32.600 --> 37:33.934
he identified your
head of security,

37:33.967 --> 37:35.867
Tarin Faroush, as
a co-conspirator.

37:37.967 --> 37:40.168
Tarin?

37:40.201 --> 37:41.500
Are you sure about this?

37:41.534 --> 37:43.134
Yes, sir. Right now
you need to call UN security

37:43.168 --> 37:46.134
and have them take Mr. Faroush
into custody until we get there.

37:46.168 --> 37:48.467
(sighs)

37:48.500 --> 37:50.700
That won't be possible,
Mr. Bauer.

37:50.734 --> 37:52.834
Tarin's not here.

37:52.867 --> 37:54.034
Where is he?

37:54.067 --> 37:55.634
I don't know.
Somewhere with my daughter.

37:55.667 --> 37:57.168
Excuse me?

37:57.201 --> 37:59.268
(sighs)
They are in love...

37:59.300 --> 38:01.234
so I've learned.

38:01.268 --> 38:04.234
Mr. Bauer, I suspected
Tarin hours ago,

38:04.268 --> 38:06.168
and had him arrested
for questioning.

38:06.201 --> 38:10.333
He escaped while being
transported to our embassy.

38:10.367 --> 38:11.734
Kayla believed he was innocent,

38:11.767 --> 38:15.700
and has, apparently,
run away with him.

38:15.734 --> 38:17.400
Do you have any idea
where they might be?

38:17.433 --> 38:19.534
None.
Can you contact your daughter?

38:19.567 --> 38:21.333
My wife has made
several attempts,

38:21.367 --> 38:22.634
but she isn't answering
her phone.

38:22.667 --> 38:23.834
Sir, you need
to keep trying.

38:23.867 --> 38:25.534
Right now Mr. Faroush
is our only lead.

38:25.567 --> 38:27.867
I'm going to jump
in the shower.

38:36.433 --> 38:38.500
(phone ringing)

38:45.700 --> 38:47.234
Hello, Mother.

38:47.268 --> 38:48.300
Kayla?

38:48.333 --> 38:49.700
I have her.

38:49.734 --> 38:51.700
Mr. Bauer, Darling,
are you all right?

38:51.734 --> 38:54.433
we have Kayla on line
with her mother.

38:54.467 --> 38:57.168
Oh, I'm fine, Mother. Mr. President,
you need to get me an address.

38:57.201 --> 38:58.834
I'm sorry I've been ignoring
your calls,

38:58.867 --> 39:01.034
but I know Father
has put you up to this.

39:01.067 --> 39:03.234
Where are you?
You know I can't tell you that.

39:03.268 --> 39:04.234
Is Tarin with you?

39:04.268 --> 39:05.934
Not at the moment, no.

39:05.967 --> 39:08.367
He doesn't want me
to speak to anyone.

39:08.400 --> 39:13.300
Kayla, listen to me,
you are in danger.

39:13.333 --> 39:16.034
Tarin is working
with your father's enemies.

39:16.067 --> 39:17.567
That's not true.

39:17.600 --> 39:18.901
It's Father's
paranoid delusions.

39:18.934 --> 39:19.901
It isn't.

39:19.934 --> 39:21.134
CTU just called
to confirm.

39:21.168 --> 39:22.967
They're on the line
with your father now.

39:23.001 --> 39:24.867
I don't believe you.

39:24.901 --> 39:28.400
Kayla, please.

39:28.433 --> 39:32.268
You know I loathed
your father's behavior

39:32.300 --> 39:35.901
and the way that he's
handled everything.

39:35.934 --> 39:38.201
I wouldn't be
telling you this

39:38.234 --> 39:39.934
unless I believed it, too.

39:39.967 --> 39:42.034
Not Tarin.

39:42.067 --> 39:43.967
It has to be a mistake.

39:44.001 --> 39:46.734
Then we'll sort
it out together.

39:46.767 --> 39:50.901
But you must tell me
where you are.

39:52.567 --> 39:54.101
Kayla!

39:54.134 --> 39:57.934
The Teodore Hotel, suite 514.

39:57.967 --> 40:00.134
The Teodore,
suite 514.

40:00.168 --> 40:03.901
Mr. Bauer. Kayla, darling,
just stay where you are.

40:03.934 --> 40:05.367
The police will be
there shortly.

40:05.400 --> 40:07.268
They are at
the Teodore Hotel, suite 514.

40:07.300 --> 40:08.834
Thank you, sir.

40:10.201 --> 40:13.600
I promise I'll call you once
the Americans give us asylum.

40:13.634 --> 40:15.734
Please don't tell Father
we spoke.

40:15.767 --> 40:17.634
Kayla? I love you, too. Hello?

40:17.667 --> 40:19.801
I thought we agreed

40:19.834 --> 40:21.467
you weren't gonna take
your mother's call.

40:21.500 --> 40:24.300
I'm sorry, my love.
I just didn't want her to worry.

40:25.634 --> 40:28.967
Did you tell her
where we are?

40:29.001 --> 40:30.201
Did you?

40:30.234 --> 40:31.734
Of course not.

40:31.767 --> 40:33.667
Do you think I'm stupid?

40:33.700 --> 40:36.101
You know I could never think
such a thing.

40:36.134 --> 40:37.767
You are perfection.

40:40.101 --> 40:42.067
Now come on.
We must get dressed.

40:42.101 --> 40:43.168
Where are we going?

40:43.201 --> 40:45.433
Where do you think?

40:45.467 --> 40:47.500
To formally request our asylum.

40:47.534 --> 40:49.134
At this hour?

40:49.168 --> 40:50.201
My friend at

40:50.234 --> 40:51.201
the State Department made
the arrangements.

40:51.234 --> 40:52.400
But I'm exhausted.

40:52.433 --> 40:55.333
We haven't even slept.

40:55.367 --> 40:57.967
I suppose you blame
me for that, huh?

40:58.001 --> 40:59.834
Well, then...
can't we have

40:59.867 --> 41:02.700
a little more time
together?

41:04.034 --> 41:06.834
No. Come on.

41:06.867 --> 41:08.500
You must get dressed.

41:11.834 --> 41:14.667
Why don't you just get
dressed here?

41:14.700 --> 41:17.034
I'm just gonna clean up first.

41:33.067 --> 41:35.600
He's in the Teodore Hotel,
suite 514.

41:35.634 --> 41:38.500
And Kayla's...
Kayla's with him.

41:45.600 --> 41:48.234
Our men are clearing out now.
It's all yours.

41:48.268 --> 41:49.567
Where are we?

41:49.600 --> 41:51.101
I could have a Tac team at
the Teodore in 20 minutes.

41:51.134 --> 41:52.600
No, NYPD can get
there faster.

41:52.634 --> 41:53.934
I want your men
to set up a perimeter

41:53.967 --> 41:55.101
and wait until
we get there.

41:55.134 --> 41:56.268
If any of your men

41:56.300 --> 41:57.700
happen to come in contact
with the suspect,

41:57.734 --> 41:58.867
it is imperative
that they know

41:58.901 --> 42:00.400
we need to take him alive.
Let's go.
