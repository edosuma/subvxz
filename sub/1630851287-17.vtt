00:34.035 --> 00:36.610
Welcome aboard
the Death Moose Caboose.

00:36.686 --> 00:40.097
Now departing for a traditional
weekend "Log and Hog."

00:40.266 --> 00:41.540
First stop, the Log Museum,

00:41.691 --> 00:43.116
followed by gorging
all-we-can-gorge

00:43.269 --> 00:45.118
<i> at the Gluttony Gulch Buffet.</i>

00:45.271 --> 00:47.454
<i> HONEYBEE:</i>
<i> Now, why do they call the area</i>
<i> we're going to Death Moose?</i>

00:47.531 --> 00:48.622
<i>Are there dead moose everywhere?</i>

00:48.716 --> 00:50.440
Wait, am I saying that right?

00:50.459 --> 00:51.216
Is "moose" plural?

00:51.368 --> 00:53.719
Mooses seems very wrong. Mooses.

00:53.870 --> 00:55.295
Mooses. Mooses.

00:55.447 --> 00:57.389
It's only named that
because it's exactly halfway

00:57.616 --> 00:59.374
between Death Cliff
and Lone Moose.

00:59.468 --> 01:02.286
It's a small strip of basically
abandoned roadside shops

01:02.304 --> 01:03.395
set back and hidden by trees.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.138
And if you didn't already know
it was there,

01:05.232 --> 01:06.790
you would never find it.

01:06.883 --> 01:08.233
That's why it's so perfect
because we usually get

01:08.402 --> 01:10.051
Gluttony Gulch Buffet
all to ourselves.

01:10.129 --> 01:11.570
That way no one has to witness

01:11.721 --> 01:13.146
how gross we all are at buffets,

01:13.240 --> 01:14.981
because we are monsters.

01:15.134 --> 01:17.576
I'm gonna make myself so sick.

01:17.727 --> 01:19.152
Well, you won't get
any judgement from me

01:19.246 --> 01:20.412
about your buffet style.

01:20.564 --> 01:21.896
I know my way
around a smorgasbord.

01:21.957 --> 01:23.473
Look, look, look, look,
look, look, look.

01:23.492 --> 01:25.417
I lined my purse with tinfoil
for leftovers.

01:25.494 --> 01:27.586
I'm gonna fill
this thing up with lasagna

01:27.663 --> 01:29.070
and up here, crab rangoon.

01:29.090 --> 01:31.331
Before we fill our mouth holes
with buffet foods,

01:31.408 --> 01:33.834
let's fill our brain holes
with log knowledge.

01:33.928 --> 01:35.344
Oop. Here we go.

01:36.913 --> 01:38.322
Hello, logs.

01:38.456 --> 01:40.599
(snoring)

01:40.768 --> 01:42.993
Aw. He's asleep.

01:43.011 --> 01:44.328
Oh, sorry. (mutters)

01:44.346 --> 01:45.829
Hope I wasn't sawing logs.

01:45.848 --> 01:47.940
I could accidentally
ruin the museum.

01:48.091 --> 01:49.015
(both laughing)

01:49.092 --> 01:50.609
Oh, good, log jokes.

01:50.719 --> 01:51.926
Maybe I'll wait in the car.

01:52.004 --> 01:53.112
Well, and what do we have here?

01:53.339 --> 01:54.613
It's the Tobin twigs
and berries.

01:54.731 --> 01:57.116
That's not what...
That's not what that means.

01:57.267 --> 01:59.100
And, Horton,
may I introduce Honeybee.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.677
She's...
(imitating Borat): my wife.

02:00.696 --> 02:02.512
Ugh, babe, what did we say?

02:02.531 --> 02:04.698
(normal voice): Sorry,
to make sure I also say...

02:04.850 --> 02:06.032
(imitating Borat):
She's nice.

02:06.201 --> 02:07.459
(laughing) There it is.

02:07.536 --> 02:09.611
All right, we are ready
for some hardcore

02:09.630 --> 02:11.797
log museum-ing, right, gang?

02:11.948 --> 02:13.023
Oh, they-they walked away.

02:13.116 --> 02:14.449
Well, museum's all yours.

02:14.543 --> 02:17.952
Oh, and, Beef, make sure
you really savor today's visit.

02:18.046 --> 02:19.787
-Okay?
-I always do.

02:19.807 --> 02:23.291
Let's get a closer look-see
at this baby log-see.

02:23.310 --> 02:26.127
Oh, this twig's
got me under her spell.

02:26.147 --> 02:29.206
(chuckles) Uh-oh,
I feel a twig jig coming on.

02:29.299 --> 02:31.633
Clear the dance floor,
I'm gonna do my twig jig.

02:31.727 --> 02:34.820
(laughs) Oh. Nobody's looking
at me. I-I'm not gonna do it.

02:34.971 --> 02:36.897
Whee!

02:37.049 --> 02:40.066
(sighs) All of the thrills,
none of the moisture.

02:40.219 --> 02:42.386
These are... fun,

02:42.479 --> 02:44.905
-but is ChewBarka
missing an eye?
-HAM: Yeah.

02:45.057 --> 02:47.391
He used to have two,
but now I pretend he's winking.

02:47.409 --> 02:50.335
-Oh, wow, very...
-Don't worry, Honeybee,

02:50.487 --> 02:52.838
you don't have to pretend
to be interested in the logs.

02:53.065 --> 02:54.322
We're really
just here for these.

02:54.400 --> 02:55.899
Technically, each patron
is only allowed one

02:55.992 --> 02:57.584
chocolate-covered pretzel log
per visit,

02:57.753 --> 03:00.086
but if Mr. Horton
doesn't see you eat them...

03:00.239 --> 03:02.681
That dude just keeps
refilling the jar.

03:02.908 --> 03:05.909
Okay. Yeah, I'm in. These things
are my whole life now.

03:05.911 --> 03:09.413
Sorry the kids always eat
all your chocolate logs, Horton,

03:09.431 --> 03:11.081
and sorry they're not better
at hiding it.

03:11.174 --> 03:13.433
Ah, you know me, Beef,
I'm a pushover.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.602
Hard for me to say no
to anyone who loves my museum.

03:15.754 --> 03:18.605
What's not to enjoy?
I mean, come on, look at this.

03:18.757 --> 03:21.425
So many of the wood world's
brightest stars,

03:21.518 --> 03:23.368
including the
pièce de résistance,

03:23.520 --> 03:24.536
Cocobolo,

03:24.763 --> 03:27.781
the single most stunning log
in the world.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.933
It's like Mother Earth
made the oceans

03:30.102 --> 03:31.376
and the land and then thought,

03:31.528 --> 03:33.212
"You know what? I'm gonna make
something just for me,"

03:33.439 --> 03:34.862
and then someone chopped it up

03:34.957 --> 03:38.124
and brought it right here for us
to see with our unworthy eyes.

03:38.277 --> 03:40.277
I know how you feel
about the logs, Beef,

03:40.295 --> 03:42.870
and that's why it's so hard
for me to tell you that,

03:42.965 --> 03:45.131
well, I have to close
the museum.

03:45.284 --> 03:47.226
-You shut your filthy log hole.
-(yelps)

03:47.377 --> 03:49.302
Oh, sorry. Are you joking?

03:49.504 --> 03:51.471
Nope. My 50-year
ground lease is up,

03:51.623 --> 03:54.382
and the owner sold the literal
ground out from under me.

03:54.551 --> 03:56.460
This is our last week, Beef.
I'm sorry.

03:56.478 --> 03:58.386
I know how much this place
means to you.

03:58.480 --> 04:01.556
Horton, no, I'm not ready
to log off yet.

04:01.633 --> 04:03.742
(groans) I didn't mean
to be playful like that.

04:03.969 --> 04:05.318
I'm actually very upset.

04:05.412 --> 04:06.987
<i> WOLF:</i>
<i> Look at him over there,</i>
<i> Honeybee.</i>

04:07.081 --> 04:10.064
He's absolutely crushed
about the ding darn museum.

04:10.084 --> 04:11.899
Only getting soup at a buffet?

04:11.994 --> 04:13.493
It's the saddest thing
I can think of.

04:13.645 --> 04:16.146
They don't even serve soup.
That's just orange juice

04:16.239 --> 04:17.330
in a bowl. (sighs)

04:17.424 --> 04:18.832
I don't know what to do. I mean,

04:18.984 --> 04:20.166
he freaking loves
the Log Museum.

04:20.261 --> 04:21.501
Honestly, I'm not sure
if he'll be able

04:21.595 --> 04:23.003
to recover from losing it.

04:23.097 --> 04:25.171
I mean, losing Mom
was one thing, but logs?

04:25.266 --> 04:28.216
Um, Wolf, what, uh,
what're you doing there?

04:28.994 --> 04:29.935
This is how I make salad.

04:30.086 --> 04:31.586
Sweet baby cheeses,

04:31.605 --> 04:33.163
you really are
disgusting buffet people.

04:33.181 --> 04:35.165
Dad used to make me wear
buffet coveralls,

04:35.183 --> 04:36.608
so I have improved a little bit.

04:36.760 --> 04:38.110
Now, I got to add some crunch.

04:38.279 --> 04:41.095
Okay, strawberry soft serve,
macaroni and cheese,

04:41.264 --> 04:42.447
chicken nuggets, ketchup,

04:42.599 --> 04:44.449
now to stir them
all together and...

04:44.601 --> 04:47.769
Uh-oh, Debbie's here.
My friend who is also my bully.

04:47.863 --> 04:49.513
Should I say hi? Or just

04:49.531 --> 04:52.774
walk away very--
Oh, no, she saw me.

04:52.868 --> 04:53.941
Oh, no, I saw her...

04:54.036 --> 04:56.378
playing with a doll.

04:57.372 --> 04:59.356
RUSSELL:
Moon, what did you do?

04:59.374 --> 05:01.616
I saw Debbie playing
with a doll.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.451
Oh, God, and what's a pee punch?

05:03.470 --> 05:04.970
Oh, she's been developing that
for years.

05:05.121 --> 05:07.714
It's when she punches you in the
bladder and you pee yourself.

05:07.866 --> 05:10.142
Well, I'm sad it's happening,
but also glad

05:10.369 --> 05:11.885
that she hasn't developed
the poop punch.

05:12.037 --> 05:14.629
Oh, yeah, you should be,
'cause she told me she's close.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.207
Shall we retire to our
conference room, gentlemen,

05:17.225 --> 05:18.725
and figure out
how to get Moon into

05:18.877 --> 05:20.560
the pee punch
protection program?

05:20.654 --> 05:23.304
Okay, so this is very, very bad.

05:23.324 --> 05:25.215
There's no way
she's gonna back down.

05:25.233 --> 05:27.717
We all know what Debbie's like
when she gets embarrassed.

05:27.736 --> 05:30.829
Remember when her mom bought
her that Princess Pony lunchbox,

05:30.998 --> 05:32.497
and she filed for emancipation?

05:32.649 --> 05:34.315
Or the time she tripped
in the school entryway

05:34.393 --> 05:35.725
and had the whole school's
office staff

05:35.819 --> 05:37.410
arrested on bogus drug charges.

05:37.563 --> 05:39.746
We've always known this is the
game we were playing with her.

05:39.898 --> 05:42.341
She's already so embarrassed
just to have friends.

05:42.492 --> 05:44.176
Maybe you should tell
Judy and Ham.

05:44.403 --> 05:45.752
They could protect you.
They're big.

05:45.904 --> 05:47.495
No way. I'm not gonna
tattletale.

05:47.589 --> 05:49.014
Moon's right.
He can't tell anyone.

05:49.241 --> 05:50.574
I've seen this
kind of thing before,

05:50.667 --> 05:52.166
and it's only going to get worse
the more people he tells.

05:52.186 --> 05:54.019
Yeah, it's bad enough
that you both know.

05:54.246 --> 05:55.762
We absolutely cannot
tell anyone else.

05:55.914 --> 05:58.339
Everyone loves money.
Maybe you can just pay her off.

05:58.433 --> 06:00.359
I like it. Empty your pockets
and backpacks, gentlemen.

06:00.552 --> 06:02.343
Okay, looks like we have
ten dollars,

06:02.437 --> 06:05.364
12 cents, and a 30% off coupon
for Fudgey Town

06:05.591 --> 06:06.773
with a nice drawing
of Fudgey the Snail.

06:06.925 --> 06:08.533
I'm not allowed
to go there anymore.

06:08.726 --> 06:10.093
I ate some turned fudge once

06:10.112 --> 06:11.536
and then diarrhea-ed
so profoundly

06:11.763 --> 06:14.781
that they actually studied me
at the Anchorage Medical Center.

06:14.933 --> 06:16.041
I'm in a textbook.

06:16.268 --> 06:17.617
Pretty sure
this'll change her mind.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.527
Moon, you have to practice
what you're going to say.

06:19.621 --> 06:22.047
Just don't remind her
of the D-O-L-L.

06:22.198 --> 06:23.289
Keep it short and sweet, 'kay?

06:23.384 --> 06:25.308
Like when I text
my mom's boyfriend, Jamie,

06:25.368 --> 06:27.219
the smiley face emoji
with the sunglasses.

06:27.370 --> 06:30.204
It's just one cool guy saying,
"Hey, you're a cool guy,"

06:30.224 --> 06:31.973
to another cool guy.

06:35.303 --> 06:38.471
Well, hello, Professor John Nash
from<i> A Beautiful Mind.</i>

06:38.565 --> 06:40.624
You look rad as hell
with that calculator.

06:40.717 --> 06:43.476
I'm trying to figure out
how to save the Log Museum.

06:43.629 --> 06:45.553
I started by looking into
how much it would cost

06:45.647 --> 06:47.647
to move the whole building
on one of those trucks.

06:47.799 --> 06:51.410
We could do it if we don't use
hot water for... ever,

06:51.561 --> 06:53.528
and also sell
the hot water heater

06:53.639 --> 06:55.989
and the van
and all of our furniture

06:56.141 --> 06:58.475
and the house. So...

06:58.493 --> 07:00.735
Dad, I know how much
you love the Log Museum,

07:00.829 --> 07:02.570
but sometimes
love just isn't enough.

07:02.589 --> 07:03.905
Mm-hmm. He's right, Beef.

07:03.999 --> 07:06.316
My neighbor Denise in Fresno
loved her boss so much

07:06.409 --> 07:08.075
she ended up getting fired
and herpes.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.076
You just need

07:09.096 --> 07:11.096
-to let it go.
-(sighs)

07:11.247 --> 07:13.080
Hey, what do you say
we take one more trip

07:13.100 --> 07:14.916
over to Death Moose
to say goodbye?

07:14.993 --> 07:16.268
-I'd like that.
-Me, too.

07:16.419 --> 07:19.012
My esophagus is just a little
chocolate log flume now.

07:19.164 --> 07:20.272
<i> MOON:</i>
<i> Hello, Debbie.</i>

07:20.499 --> 07:22.423
What do you want, Elbow Face?

07:22.443 --> 07:24.609
Perhaps in exchange
for not beating me up,

07:24.761 --> 07:28.262
I could offer you these
ten dollars and this 12 cents.

07:28.356 --> 07:30.282
Would you like to accept
my proposal?

07:30.433 --> 07:31.524
(growls)

07:31.677 --> 07:34.344
And, um, just to be clear,
well, you know,

07:34.346 --> 07:37.013
I definitely didn't see anything
you were doing with dolls

07:37.106 --> 07:38.439
at Gluttony Gulch
in Death Moose.

07:38.459 --> 07:39.941
No, no, no, no.

07:40.035 --> 07:41.275
It didn't even look that much

07:41.295 --> 07:42.869
like you. I mean, maybe
you have a long lost

07:42.963 --> 07:44.278
twin you've never met.
(laughs nervously)

07:44.298 --> 07:45.947
Did you ever go to summer camp?

07:46.041 --> 07:47.632
Oh, thanks for the money.

07:47.859 --> 07:50.543
Now I'll be even richer
when I pee punch you.

07:50.696 --> 07:52.787
Why did you keep talking?
We went over this.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.548
I know, I know, I know,
but she didn't say anything,

07:55.701 --> 07:57.701
and I got nervous
and I just kept talking.

07:57.719 --> 08:00.220
When I get nervous,
my whole body smells like feet,

08:00.314 --> 08:03.464
but not<i> my</i> feet,
which is the weird part.

08:04.467 --> 08:06.151
There still has to be
a logical way out of this.

08:06.378 --> 08:07.727
-Let's brainstorm.
-Okay.

08:07.879 --> 08:10.380
Maybe we... Hm, I don't know,
paint your face green,

08:10.398 --> 08:12.232
bury you up to your neck
in my mom's garden,

08:12.326 --> 08:13.566
and pretend
you're a head of lettuce?

08:13.719 --> 08:15.494
Uh-huh, that's a good start.
I don't mind dirt.

08:15.645 --> 08:18.071
Maybe you can get a bigger bully
to scare her off.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.313
There are no bigger bullies.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.333
She's the tip-top
of the bully food chain.

08:21.484 --> 08:24.336
She's above high schoolers.
She's above Gargamel.

08:24.563 --> 08:26.654
Oh, I know. We can go
to Jamie's boxing gym and--

08:26.748 --> 08:29.749
Oh, shoot. I just remembered,
Jamie's in Salt Lake City

08:29.901 --> 08:31.325
for the Toot-A-Loo
Flute Festival.

08:31.494 --> 08:34.571
He said maybe next year
me and my mom and my brother

08:34.664 --> 08:37.164
could go with him,
and I could be his flute caddie.

08:37.184 --> 08:38.591
-Can you imagine?
-Levon!

08:38.668 --> 08:41.520
Stop pretending those dodgeballs
are your butt cheeks.

08:41.747 --> 08:43.688
Am I gonna have to send you
to the principal's office again?

08:43.915 --> 08:47.341
Oh, Robbie! Stop slow dancing
with the climbing rope.

08:47.361 --> 08:50.362
It's beautiful, but it's not
on the curriculum.

08:50.589 --> 08:51.421
-Huh.
-What?

08:51.439 --> 08:53.273
Coach Kiely was mad at Levon,

08:53.367 --> 08:54.849
but then Robbie
did something bad...

08:54.868 --> 08:56.551
I see what you're getting at.
We just need to shift

08:56.611 --> 08:59.262
Debbie's anger for you
onto someone else.

08:59.281 --> 09:01.188
Yup. Then she'll be
more mad at them,

09:01.208 --> 09:03.449
and she'll forget about
how mad she is at me.

09:03.618 --> 09:05.785
-Bravo. It's genius.
-RUSSELL: You guys want to see

09:05.937 --> 09:07.437
my flute caddie walk?

09:07.455 --> 09:09.289
(whistling)

09:10.217 --> 09:14.110
Hello, Horton. I won't be long.
I just wanted to say goodbye.

09:14.203 --> 09:15.870
Course, Beef. I understand.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.556
And, Beef, no rules today.

09:17.783 --> 09:19.206
If you want to touch
the cocobolo log,

09:19.301 --> 09:20.466
I'll turn the other way.

09:20.561 --> 09:22.468
Do you want me to put on
white gloves first?

09:22.621 --> 09:24.954
I keep some in the car
in case this day ever came.

09:24.973 --> 09:26.898
No, Beef, not necessary.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.717
Hello, handsome.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.218
Oh, sweet<i> Suddenly Susan,</i>

09:31.313 --> 09:34.406
it's so smooth,
naturally oily to the touch,

09:34.633 --> 09:36.908
which of course is common
for the tropical hardwoods

09:37.060 --> 09:39.135
of Central America. The grain...

09:39.228 --> 09:41.729
It's perfect. (gasps)

09:41.898 --> 09:43.473
Logs. Of course.

09:43.566 --> 09:46.810
(chuckles) You knew how
to save yourselves all along.

09:46.828 --> 09:48.753
Honeybee, Wolf, Horton,
come here!

09:48.980 --> 09:51.072
Look, the stone blocks
for the pyramids

09:51.166 --> 09:52.924
were too heavy to move by hand,

09:53.076 --> 09:55.168
so they rolled them on logs.

09:55.320 --> 09:58.488
We can't keep the museum on
the land it currently rests on,

09:58.581 --> 10:00.599
but we can save
the museum itself

10:00.750 --> 10:03.343
by moving it to our property.

10:03.495 --> 10:04.327
Aw, well...

10:04.346 --> 10:05.920
-Uh...
-It can stay rent-free

10:05.939 --> 10:07.272
and remain open for everyone.

10:07.423 --> 10:10.108
And I can visit Coco
whenever I want.

10:10.293 --> 10:12.018
Do you hear that, Coco?.
You're safe now.

10:12.170 --> 10:14.003
Beef, I'm not really sure
that's a...

10:14.097 --> 10:15.188
I know it seems complicated,

10:15.340 --> 10:16.506
but I'll figure
the whole thing out.

10:16.599 --> 10:18.283
We'll do it exactly
like they did back then.

10:18.468 --> 10:20.434
Sick plan, Dad. Count us in.

10:20.528 --> 10:22.695
And, Horton, you keep
those chocolate logs coming.

10:22.864 --> 10:24.013
We're gonna need our strength.

10:24.032 --> 10:25.123
Okay, guys,

10:25.274 --> 10:27.459
every time Ms. McNamara
supervises lunch,

10:27.610 --> 10:28.852
she walks the cafeteria

10:28.870 --> 10:30.277
eating her raspberry
and cottage cheese

10:30.297 --> 10:32.464
mix-'em-up cup.
At exactly the right moment,

10:32.691 --> 10:35.041
I'm going to trip her, in a very
safe, but very effective way,

10:35.193 --> 10:38.285
so that she spills her raspberry
cottage cheese all over Debbie.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.954
That way, Debbie's anger for me

10:40.048 --> 10:42.715
will move over to Ms. McNamara,
but lucky for her,

10:42.868 --> 10:44.809
she's an adult
and can't be beaten up.

10:44.961 --> 10:46.219
And then my problem is solved.

10:46.313 --> 10:47.720
Okay, but what if you miss?

10:47.873 --> 10:49.147
I won't miss, Henry.

10:49.298 --> 10:51.483
This isn't my first
staged tripping.

10:51.634 --> 10:52.984
Go time.

10:54.212 --> 10:55.136
Ah!

10:55.230 --> 10:58.047
(gasps) Oh, my God.
You are dead.

10:58.066 --> 11:01.217
Debbie. Oh, no. Oh,
I am so, so, so sorry, Debbie.

11:01.236 --> 11:02.735
I don't know what happened.
An apple

11:02.888 --> 11:04.996
rolled under my foot somehow,
and-- Oh, here. Oh, my gosh,

11:05.073 --> 11:06.164
let me just clean you up.

11:06.391 --> 11:07.557
-Oh, no, no, no, no.
-Ms. McNamara,

11:07.575 --> 11:08.983
don't worry at all.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.060
Everyone makes mistakes.
Maybe, if you could be so kind,

11:11.079 --> 11:12.729
you could get me
some paper towels

11:12.747 --> 11:14.005
-from the janitor's closet?
-Oh, yes. Thank you.

11:14.232 --> 11:16.157
Thank you, Debbie. Of course.
Everyone out of my way.

11:16.251 --> 11:18.418
-Debbie needs paper towels.
-Hi, Moon.

11:18.512 --> 11:20.570
Interesting tactic.

11:20.663 --> 11:23.014
Get me mad at someone else,
so I'll forget about you.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.741
I respect it,
but it didn't work.

11:24.759 --> 11:26.743
Oh, and just a quick update
on what's up with me,

11:26.836 --> 11:30.096
my research on the poop punch
has finally paid off.

11:30.248 --> 11:31.672
-(groans)
-Okay, new idea,

11:31.692 --> 11:34.175
we slather you in Vaseline,
so you're too slippery to fight,

11:34.194 --> 11:35.435
and if she still
keeps coming after you,

11:35.529 --> 11:37.362
then we just slide you
right into the ocean.

11:40.442 --> 11:42.608
Oh, Moon, great.
You're just in time.

11:42.703 --> 11:44.110
We're about to begin.
Come on, grab a seat.

11:44.262 --> 11:45.870
Sorry, Dad,
no time for sitting.

11:46.097 --> 11:47.597
I've got a prob... ject,

11:47.615 --> 11:50.116
school probject
I need to work on tonight.

11:50.268 --> 11:52.952
Say no more.
From one projecteur to another,

11:53.104 --> 11:55.196
I wish you luck.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.106
You two know
about this probject?

11:57.200 --> 11:58.365
Yeah, we know about it.

11:58.460 --> 12:00.443
We're currently
monitoring it from afar.

12:00.462 --> 12:01.611
Listen, when another girl
threatens to punch

12:01.629 --> 12:03.204
your little brother,
it's best to let him

12:03.298 --> 12:04.797
try to work it out
before getting involved.

12:04.891 --> 12:07.467
Especially when you yourself
are afraid of said girl.

12:07.619 --> 12:08.393
-Debbie?
-Debbie.

12:08.620 --> 12:09.543
Understood.

12:09.563 --> 12:11.212
Now, let's get down
to brass logs.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.122
I have created a foolproof plan

12:13.141 --> 12:16.309
of how to move the Log Museum
here to our property,

12:16.461 --> 12:18.219
where it will be
conveniently located

12:18.238 --> 12:19.312
near the family cemetery.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.222
I want our ancestors' spirits

12:21.299 --> 12:22.465
to be able to enjoy the logs.

12:22.484 --> 12:24.558
Okay, but if I see
any ghostly Tobins

12:24.652 --> 12:26.970
near my chocolate pretzels,
I will kill them again.

12:26.988 --> 12:28.562
Now, first things first.

12:28.656 --> 12:31.082
Junkyard Kyle has kindly agreed
to raise the museum structure

12:31.234 --> 12:32.900
and put it on cinder blocks
in exchange

12:32.919 --> 12:35.661
for a gallon of vape juice,
two old coffee makers,

12:35.738 --> 12:38.147
and Wolf's half-shirt
that says, "Who Farted?"

12:38.166 --> 12:39.482
Oh, I'm gonna miss that shirt,

12:39.501 --> 12:42.001
but I got a tank top
that says "Fart Loading"

12:42.170 --> 12:43.410
ready to take its place.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.764
And then, we'll attach
the tether apparatus

12:45.991 --> 12:49.267
around the museum and
to the back of the family van.

12:49.418 --> 12:50.918
I'll pull the museum forward,

12:51.012 --> 12:53.938
and as it passes over
each log in the rear,

12:54.165 --> 12:55.348
you guys will lift said log

12:55.500 --> 12:57.667
and move it to the front
of the other log.

12:57.760 --> 12:59.502
And, of course,
this must all be done

12:59.521 --> 13:02.113
in the dead of night when there
won't be any cars on the roads.

13:02.265 --> 13:04.282
Now, I'm usually not one
to be tooting horns,

13:04.509 --> 13:08.102
but, uh, a-tooty-too-toot,
this plan is perfection.

13:08.196 --> 13:09.436
What else can we roll over here?

13:09.531 --> 13:11.623
Can we get a Dave & Busters
on the premises?

13:13.627 --> 13:15.018
Oh, boy.

13:15.036 --> 13:16.686
Hey, Moon, um...

13:16.704 --> 13:20.948
So... I may have inadvertently
fixed your Debbie problem.

13:21.042 --> 13:22.133
Really? How?

13:22.360 --> 13:23.468
Well, you know how I do

13:23.619 --> 13:25.452
my weekly check-ins
with Principal Gibbons

13:25.588 --> 13:27.880
because I'm head
of the Junior Janitors?

13:28.033 --> 13:29.290
-Yeah.
-Well...

13:29.309 --> 13:31.551
I may have been doing
that weekly check-in

13:31.703 --> 13:33.886
and everything about Debbie
may have kind of

13:33.980 --> 13:35.721
totally accidentally
come spilling out.

13:35.874 --> 13:36.889
You ratted?

13:37.042 --> 13:38.799
<i> GIBBONS (over P.A.):</i>
<i> Will Moon Tobin</i>

13:38.968 --> 13:40.301
<i> and Debbie Van please come</i>
<i> to the principal's office.</i>

13:40.395 --> 13:42.061
Would you be less mad
if I told you

13:42.213 --> 13:44.489
he has Andes after-dinner mints
on his desk this week?

13:44.716 --> 13:46.732
No? Okay, bye. (whimpers)

13:46.885 --> 13:48.384
Now, Debbie, what is this I hear

13:48.553 --> 13:51.312
about you saying you're gonna
beat up Moon on Friday?

13:51.331 --> 13:55.224
Oh, yeah, I did say that,
but it's because I...

13:55.243 --> 13:56.726
-have a crush on him.
-GIBBONS: Oh.

13:56.744 --> 14:00.063
Of course, yes.
Romantic feelings at your age

14:00.081 --> 14:01.747
can be very confusing.

14:01.824 --> 14:03.824
Yeah. Totally. So sorry.

14:03.918 --> 14:06.419
Moon, would you like
to share anything?

14:06.537 --> 14:10.073
-Mm-mm.
-Well, feeling shy
is also perfectly normal.

14:10.091 --> 14:11.741
You guys can head back to class.

14:11.759 --> 14:14.077
Thank you so much.
I've sure learned my lesson.

14:14.095 --> 14:15.687
-And, Moon.
-Yeah?

14:15.838 --> 14:18.672
Take it easy on Debbie, okay?
She's in new territory here.

14:18.808 --> 14:21.100
Yup, I'll take it easy
on Debbie.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.268
Sure thing.

14:22.420 --> 14:24.604
-(gasps)
-You listen to me, Pajanimal,

14:24.698 --> 14:27.256
you messed up big time
trying to get me in trouble.

14:27.350 --> 14:29.442
It wasn't me. Russell
told Principal Gibbons...

14:29.594 --> 14:31.611
Well, your plan backfired
because now

14:31.705 --> 14:34.447
I'm going to do a pee punch
and a double poop punch.

14:34.599 --> 14:36.374
So, first,
you'll pee out the front.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.859
Then you'll poop out the back.
Then you'll poop out the front.

14:38.879 --> 14:41.880
(gasps) That's not possible.

14:42.107 --> 14:45.291
A pee pee. A poo poo. A poo poo.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.275
(sighs)

14:46.369 --> 14:48.444
All right, time to figure out

14:48.537 --> 14:51.114
how to sneak into
the wheel well of a 747.

14:51.132 --> 14:53.540
Hey, Moon, how's the, uh...

14:53.635 --> 14:56.636
school project coming? Uh...

14:56.730 --> 14:58.396
You know, son,
if I didn't know any better,

14:58.623 --> 15:01.382
I'd swear that you've attempted
to change your appearance

15:01.401 --> 15:03.142
and are now planning
to go on the lam

15:03.236 --> 15:05.144
so that a certain frenemy
doesn't punch you.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.906
Great guess,
but don't try to stop me.

15:08.057 --> 15:09.148
This is the only way now.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.816
Well, I'm sure you're right.

15:10.911 --> 15:12.577
Do you have everything packed
that you need?

15:12.728 --> 15:15.154
Yup, just need to burn off
my fingerprints

15:15.306 --> 15:16.563
and eat my SIM card.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.307
Wonderful. Now,
before you run away

15:18.401 --> 15:20.977
and live a life of adventure
walking the highway

15:21.070 --> 15:22.569
and hustling pinball
at truck stops,

15:22.664 --> 15:24.497
I wonder if you can just
take one more look

15:24.573 --> 15:26.499
at your problem
from a different angle.

15:26.651 --> 15:29.427
You might find the answer
is closer than you think.

15:29.578 --> 15:31.745
Like, no one was threatening
to beat me up this week,

15:31.765 --> 15:33.322
but my heart felt beat up

15:33.341 --> 15:35.174
about the Log Museum closing.

15:35.326 --> 15:36.993
My problem was logs,

15:37.011 --> 15:39.270
and it turned out
my solution was also logs.

15:39.497 --> 15:41.422
Maybe your solution
is right in front of you,

15:41.441 --> 15:42.756
and you just don't know it.

15:42.850 --> 15:45.017
So, give it a think
before you head out and never

15:45.170 --> 15:46.669
see us again, okay, bud?

15:46.762 --> 15:48.838
Hm... My problem is Debbie.

15:48.898 --> 15:51.190
Maybe my solution
is also Debbie.

15:51.284 --> 15:54.268
Dad, is it okay if I walk over
to the Van's house?

15:54.362 --> 15:56.788
Sure, just take
the emergency phone

15:56.864 --> 15:57.938
and stay on the path.

15:58.032 --> 15:59.123
I carved that path.

15:59.350 --> 16:01.542
I'm not gonna abandon it now.

16:02.537 --> 16:04.629
Hello, Debbie's mom.

16:07.801 --> 16:10.392
Hi, Moon. I'm sorry,
but Debbie isn't here right now.

16:10.394 --> 16:12.453
She's at the ice rink--
Uh-oh, I know that face.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.046
Is Debbie planning
to beat you up?

16:14.140 --> 16:15.531
You could tell that
just from my face?

16:15.624 --> 16:17.958
Ugh, she threatens
to beat people up pretty often.

16:17.978 --> 16:19.960
Just last week,
her orthodontist showed up here

16:20.054 --> 16:21.721
looking just like
you do right now.

16:21.873 --> 16:24.465
-What'd you do?
-I saw her with her doll
at Gluttony Gulch Buffet.

16:24.559 --> 16:25.299
Yikes.

16:25.468 --> 16:27.134
Why is she so worried about me

16:27.153 --> 16:28.227
seeing her play with a doll?

16:28.379 --> 16:30.046
We all still play with toys
at our age.

16:30.064 --> 16:32.231
We don't talk about it,
but we know it happens.

16:32.383 --> 16:35.067
Well, it's a little bit
my fault, maybe.

16:35.220 --> 16:36.477
I mean,
I shouldn't tell you this,

16:36.496 --> 16:38.145
but you look like
the kind of small bear

16:38.239 --> 16:39.480
that can keep a secret.

16:39.499 --> 16:40.556
-Is that right?
-Yup.

16:40.575 --> 16:42.316
I made Debbie
repeat kindergarten.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.243
You held Debbie back? Why?

16:44.395 --> 16:46.170
Well, she was just so tiny
back then.

16:46.397 --> 16:47.988
And the first time
she did kindergarten,

16:48.157 --> 16:50.008
when we lived in Death Cliff,
she got picked on all year.

16:50.235 --> 16:51.658
So, when we moved
to Lone Moose, I thought

16:51.678 --> 16:53.327
it'd be a good idea for her
to repeat kindergarten,

16:53.421 --> 16:55.013
so she'd be a little bigger.
But guess what?

16:55.181 --> 16:57.089
-She hated it.
-That's right, Moon.

16:57.183 --> 16:58.407
She wouldn't talk to me
for months.

16:58.501 --> 17:00.000
It wasn't until
I bought her that doll

17:00.094 --> 17:01.519
that she started
calling me Carissa again.

17:01.670 --> 17:04.505
Then we worked our way back
to Mom over the next few years,

17:04.524 --> 17:07.025
but the whole incident
had some... lasting effects.

17:07.101 --> 17:09.861
She really hates being seen
as little in any way.

17:10.012 --> 17:12.179
I see. So, she's not mean.

17:12.273 --> 17:14.014
She's just hurt
and kind of scared.

17:14.034 --> 17:16.868
(laughs) Come on, Moon,
she's definitely mean.

17:17.095 --> 17:18.761
But, yes,
hurt and scared as well.

17:18.780 --> 17:21.539
It's also the reason she wears
those darn skates all the time,

17:21.766 --> 17:23.616
so she'll be taller
and have weapons on her feet.

17:23.768 --> 17:26.711
Thank you, Mrs. Van.
I think I know what to do now.

17:26.862 --> 17:28.454
No need to tell Debbie
I was here.

17:28.606 --> 17:30.381
Actually, it's probably better
if you don't.

17:30.533 --> 17:31.698
Sure thing, Moon.

17:31.867 --> 17:33.609
Uh-oh. That's gonna be her
father dropping her off.

17:33.628 --> 17:35.945
Run, Moon. Cut through
the backyard. Jump the fence.

17:35.963 --> 17:38.539
See, Horton, it's working.

17:38.558 --> 17:41.300
The museum will be open
for decades to come,

17:41.377 --> 17:43.227
and I can visit you
and Coco every day.

17:43.379 --> 17:46.230
That's nice, Beef.
That'll be real nice for you.

17:46.382 --> 17:48.140
-But...
-(both scream)

17:48.293 --> 17:49.809
Oh, no, it's gonna hit the van.

17:49.961 --> 17:53.145
Oh, no it didn't hit the v--
oh, no, the rope's breaking.

17:53.298 --> 17:55.147
Everyone get away
from the museum!

17:55.316 --> 17:56.390
She's gonna break free.

17:56.559 --> 17:57.408
(all yelling)

17:57.560 --> 17:58.892
-No!
-Oh, no!

17:58.912 --> 18:00.620
(overlapping yelling)

18:01.730 --> 18:03.306
We can save the museum.

18:03.399 --> 18:04.807
Everyone, just grab some pieces.

18:04.867 --> 18:06.567
We'll rebuild it
and make it even better.

18:06.661 --> 18:09.570
It'll be ten stories--
no, 20 stories tall,

18:09.589 --> 18:12.148
-and visitors will come
from around the world...
-Beef.

18:12.166 --> 18:14.425
Just let it die.
It's what I want.

18:14.652 --> 18:16.986
The land lease didn't get
sold out from under me.

18:17.079 --> 18:19.079
-I let it expire.
-Why?

18:19.099 --> 18:20.414
I'm done, Beef.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.174
The only people that come
to the museum anymore

18:22.327 --> 18:24.102
are drifters that
need to go number two,

18:24.329 --> 18:25.586
and there's this guy Rodney.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.588
He always tries to put
his mouth on a log,

18:27.607 --> 18:30.516
and when I stop him,
he accuses me of doing 9/11.

18:30.685 --> 18:32.835
I want to retire to Miami
and get a girlfriend.

18:32.854 --> 18:36.114
Maybe a boyfriend. Wear
a thong underwear bathing suit.

18:36.265 --> 18:38.116
Feel the sun on my lower cheeks.

18:38.284 --> 18:39.933
I understand, Horton.

18:39.953 --> 18:41.510
Far be it from me to stop a man

18:41.529 --> 18:44.605
that has so honorably served
the history of logs

18:44.699 --> 18:45.957
from living out his dream.

18:46.184 --> 18:48.442
Everyone deserves a chance
to show off their butt

18:48.519 --> 18:50.353
in their autumn years
if they wish.

18:50.446 --> 18:51.445
Now, let me help you.

18:51.464 --> 18:52.797
We need to get Coco
out of there,

18:52.948 --> 18:54.357
so he can go to his new home.

18:54.375 --> 18:56.467
He belongs with you, Beef.
He always did.

18:56.619 --> 18:59.362
You hear that, buddy?
You're coming home with me.

18:59.455 --> 19:02.882
Okay, Moon.
Time to pull up or shut up.

19:03.034 --> 19:04.367
(Henry and Russell gasp)

19:04.385 --> 19:06.719
-You can't.
-Moon, are you sure?

19:06.871 --> 19:07.870
Yes.

19:07.963 --> 19:08.980
Hey, Debbie.

19:09.207 --> 19:10.723
(students gasp and laugh)

19:10.875 --> 19:11.724
Oh, my gosh.

19:11.876 --> 19:12.984
Um, what the hell

19:13.135 --> 19:14.377
do you think you're doing?

19:14.395 --> 19:16.228
Why are you wearing a diaper?

19:16.322 --> 19:17.897
And holding that stuffed sloth?

19:18.049 --> 19:19.157
His name is Jeremy,

19:19.384 --> 19:20.900
and I'm publicly
embarrassing myself

19:20.994 --> 19:22.218
to show you that
it doesn't matter

19:22.236 --> 19:23.886
what people think about you.

19:23.979 --> 19:26.146
So what if people think
I'm a weirdo baby in a diaper?

19:26.166 --> 19:27.740
You're my friend, Debbie,
and it's worth it

19:27.892 --> 19:29.408
to put myself out there
to end this.

19:29.485 --> 19:31.836
There's nothing wrong with
still being little sometimes

19:32.063 --> 19:33.171
and wanting to play with a doll.

19:33.398 --> 19:34.955
I got Jeremy when I was four,

19:35.066 --> 19:36.916
and I still hold him
when I feel scared,

19:37.068 --> 19:39.043
like when I accidentally
watched<i> The Purge,</i>

19:39.195 --> 19:41.512
and then when I watched
all the sequels on purpose.

19:41.664 --> 19:43.830
Personally, I think
your doll is cool,

19:43.850 --> 19:46.242
and I would never pick on you
for being small.

19:46.260 --> 19:47.834
Oh, thank you so much.

19:47.854 --> 19:50.354
That was such a great speech,
Keith Bore-ison,

19:50.506 --> 19:53.416
but I have never even been
embarrassed in my entire life.

19:53.509 --> 19:54.600
And I don't own a doll.

19:54.752 --> 19:56.585
And I'm not little,
and I never have been.

19:56.604 --> 19:58.512
When I came out
of my mom's vagina,

19:58.531 --> 19:59.939
which was also very big,

20:00.091 --> 20:01.273
all the doctors
in the hospital fainted

20:01.426 --> 20:03.701
because I was
so large and scary.

20:03.852 --> 20:05.036
Okay then, Debbie,

20:05.279 --> 20:07.688
proceed with the pee and poop
and double poop punches,

20:07.740 --> 20:11.024
but just remember that, even
after I've pooped out my front,

20:11.044 --> 20:12.543
I'll still be your friend.

20:14.105 --> 20:15.771
(grunts) Oh, my God.

20:15.790 --> 20:18.441
Get out of here. I can't beat up
some little diaper boy

20:18.459 --> 20:20.885
because that would be
embarrassing for me.

20:21.036 --> 20:22.053
And like I said, Moon Tobin,

20:22.204 --> 20:24.889
I've never ever
been embarrassed.

20:25.040 --> 20:26.449
This is probably
the most triumphant

20:26.542 --> 20:28.250
I'll ever feel
while wearing a diaper

20:28.252 --> 20:29.802
in front of a bunch of people.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.044
At least, I hope so.

20:31.064 --> 20:33.213
All hail Moon Tobin.

20:33.233 --> 20:35.215
-The Diaper King.
-Russell, no.

20:35.384 --> 20:38.811
So, Moon, how'd your
school probject turn out?

20:38.963 --> 20:40.296
Well, you were right, Dad.

20:40.389 --> 20:42.147
The solution was
right in front of me.

20:42.300 --> 20:44.057
It was a large diaper
and a stuffed sloth.

20:44.226 --> 20:45.910
There you go. I'm proud of you,

20:46.061 --> 20:47.319
and Coco's happy for you, too.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.305
Hey, Dad, where are you
gonna keep Coco?

20:49.323 --> 20:50.397
Oh, I meant to tell you.

20:50.416 --> 20:52.083
I'm gonna need you and Honeybee

20:52.234 --> 20:54.067
to move to a motel downtown.

20:54.161 --> 20:55.478
Coco needs his space.

20:55.496 --> 20:57.496
Fair enough, Dad.
We'll go get our things.
