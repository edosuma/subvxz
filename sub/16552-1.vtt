00:06.006 --> 00:08.217
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>why this is happening, sorry.</i>

00:08.300 --> 00:09.927
<i>No, it's fine.</i>

00:10.010 --> 00:11.011
Hold on.
I'll pull it this way.

00:11.094 --> 00:12.721
I think I'm gonna actually go get
another drink, since...

00:12.804 --> 00:13.805
Okay. All right.

00:13.889 --> 00:15.015
-I need to keep drinking.
-I'll find you.

00:15.098 --> 00:16.558
You know what I'm saying?
I'll see you in a second.

00:16.642 --> 00:17.726
All right.

00:19.478 --> 00:21.647
- This is not my life.
- Yeah, okay.

00:21.730 --> 00:22.898
This is not--
I mean, like, uh...

00:22.981 --> 00:24.399
-I'm a stay-at-home dad.
-Uh-huh, well--

00:24.483 --> 00:26.151
Andi makes way more money than me.

00:26.235 --> 00:27.861
-Okay.
-We're totally happy.

00:27.945 --> 00:29.446
Okay. Happy, yeah!

00:29.530 --> 00:31.156
-We have great sex.
-Happy. Okay.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.783
Hmm?

00:32.866 --> 00:34.368
-What's the--
-Do you?

00:34.451 --> 00:35.869
Well, who does...

00:35.953 --> 00:39.540
...after knowing each other
for 19 years and...

00:39.623 --> 00:41.542
I mean, I don't think
it's because of the money.

00:41.625 --> 00:43.710
-I mean, it's because--
-What are you guys talking about?

00:43.794 --> 00:45.420
-Oh, nothing.
-You would like this.

00:45.504 --> 00:47.256
-No, don't even bother. Don't--
-Mmm-hmm.

00:47.339 --> 00:48.340
- She would hate this.
- What?

00:48.423 --> 00:49.800
- No. No, I read a study.
- Trust me.

00:49.883 --> 00:54.763
And it says couples who observe
more gender normative roles

00:54.846 --> 00:57.182
have more sex.

00:58.225 --> 00:59.893
-He read an article.
-What is gender normative role?

00:59.977 --> 01:03.480
-What is that? What are they?
-It's stereotypically classical, uh,

01:03.564 --> 01:06.358
male and female tasks in the home,

01:06.441 --> 01:08.610
such as the male being
the primary breadwinner

01:08.694 --> 01:11.572
and the wife cleans the house and does
the dishes and takes care of the kids.

01:11.655 --> 01:12.656
Yes.

01:12.739 --> 01:13.740
What, that they have--

01:13.824 --> 01:15.826
-People that do that--
-They have more and better sex.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.035
-More and better.
-Oh, and better!

01:17.119 --> 01:18.287
And that's totally measurable.

01:18.370 --> 01:19.371
-It's--
-Talking about sex?

01:19.454 --> 01:21.999
-I am talking about a study. Yes.
-About the study.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.959
-Hey, baby, you gotta hear this.
-But is this just because

01:24.042 --> 01:25.377
he doesn't want to do
any housework?

01:25.460 --> 01:26.920
Well, that's what
I'm trying to figure out.

01:27.004 --> 01:30.424
What the point of all of--

01:30.507 --> 01:35.429
Aspects of the study may benefit
personal desires of mine,

01:35.512 --> 01:37.431
but the fact remains,
according to this at least,

01:37.514 --> 01:39.683
if I was doing less laundry
and less dishes,

01:39.766 --> 01:40.892
we would be having more sex.

01:40.976 --> 01:42.769
- Who did they poll in this?
- Exactly.

01:42.853 --> 01:44.438
- They studied people.
- But do you not see

01:44.521 --> 01:46.481
-how deeply sexist this is?
-See, that's not about sex.

01:46.565 --> 01:48.609
-Yeah.
-That is-- It's true, it's not about sex.

01:48.692 --> 01:51.820
That's a man feeling
like somehow he's lost his power

01:51.903 --> 01:53.780
because his wife is making more money.

01:53.864 --> 01:55.741
- It's comin' from her side.
- Yeah, but if--

01:55.824 --> 01:57.951
She's happier,
but less likely to want to have sex.

01:58.035 --> 02:00.537
No, it's not our fault
if you feel emasculated.

02:00.621 --> 02:01.663
Exactly.

02:01.747 --> 02:03.915
If you feel emasculated
because you don't go to work

02:03.999 --> 02:05.459
and you're staying home
and doing the dishes,

02:05.542 --> 02:07.252
like, you can't take it out
on your wife

02:07.336 --> 02:10.547
and then blame her
for not wanting to fuck you or something.

02:10.631 --> 02:13.634
-Excuse my French.
-But you're saying that the women said

02:13.717 --> 02:19.097
that they are less likely to want to fuck
the guy if they're making more money.

02:19.181 --> 02:20.932
-Than the man.
-Oh! Bam! Okay.

02:21.016 --> 02:22.100
No. I disagree.

02:22.184 --> 02:25.354
It's gotta be about more than that.
If I don't want to fuck you,

02:25.437 --> 02:27.814
I don't care how many dishes
you do or don't do,

02:27.898 --> 02:30.317
or how much laundry you do or don't do.
There's something else missing.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.818
-I agree.
-That's why I don't want to fuck you.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.618
You would tell me, right?

02:41.495 --> 02:44.331
-What?
-If-- You would tell me, right?

02:44.414 --> 02:45.707
If...

02:45.791 --> 02:49.378
if my staying at home with the kids
and you going to work...

02:50.295 --> 02:52.464
-Kyle. Kyle.
-...that made you less attracted to me,

02:52.547 --> 02:54.591
-you would tell me.
-Kyle.

02:54.674 --> 02:57.803
I would--
There's nothing to tell you.

02:57.886 --> 02:59.971
It's okay if it's true.
I just want to know.

03:00.055 --> 03:03.475
Honey, I'm so attracted to you.

03:03.558 --> 03:06.561
I have been attracted to you
since I met you.

03:06.645 --> 03:09.689
Right, but when I started staying home
with the kids,

03:09.773 --> 03:12.567
and you went to work full-time,
did that...

03:13.610 --> 03:16.279
-did that change your opinion of me?
-I... I didn't have-- No.

03:16.363 --> 03:20.325
Oh, my God, if anything,
it made me love you more and...

03:20.409 --> 03:24.287
Right, but not love me more.
You know what I'm asking.

03:24.371 --> 03:26.748
Honey, when people have kids,
they're not like--

03:26.832 --> 03:29.626
I think it's...
It is hard sometimes.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.013
- Hey!
- Hey, party animals.

03:42.097 --> 03:43.515
- Hi.
- Oh, yeah.

03:43.598 --> 03:45.684
- How was it?
- It was good.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.310
It was okay.
Excuse me a second.

03:47.394 --> 03:48.854
Do you--
What time did they go down?

03:48.937 --> 03:50.355
Oh, like 9:00.

03:50.439 --> 03:52.524
-Okay, that's not bad.
-Yep. No.

03:52.607 --> 03:54.317
Did they ever, uh...

03:55.652 --> 03:58.780
figure out what they wanted
to be for Halloween? Have they decided?

03:58.864 --> 04:01.700
Uh, we discussed it for a minute.

04:01.783 --> 04:02.784
Yeah, uh,

04:02.868 --> 04:06.163
Penny wants to be a princess
and Allen will be her knight.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.372
-Oh.
-Oh.

04:07.456 --> 04:09.166
-Cute, right?
-It is cute.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.501
Um, we forgot to get cash.
Can we PayPal you?

04:11.585 --> 04:12.586
-Yes.
-I'm so sorry.

04:12.669 --> 04:13.670
-Sorry.
-It was his fault.

04:13.754 --> 04:14.963
- That's fine. I don't--
- Just saying.

04:15.046 --> 04:16.631
-It is my fault.
-He said he was going to the ATM

04:16.715 --> 04:18.216
-and then he didn't.
-Of course.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.552
-All right, guys.
-All right, thank you, honey.

04:20.635 --> 04:21.803
- Thank you.
- Bye. Thank you.

04:21.887 --> 04:23.597
See you soon.
Okay, bye-bye.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.099
Did she say princess and knight?

04:26.183 --> 04:29.436
-Yeah. Isn't that such a weird out?
-That's totally weird.

04:30.562 --> 04:33.064
-I don't get it.
-I thought our kids were cool.

04:33.148 --> 04:34.816
I thought they were cool, too.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.109
-We might have to take 'em back.
-Losers!

04:36.193 --> 04:37.194
Return them.

04:37.277 --> 04:40.947
Exactly. That's why we have to use
the beet juice coloring.

04:41.031 --> 04:43.283
We can't do artificial red.

04:43.366 --> 04:49.080
If you want me to resend you that email
where I go into detail about

04:49.164 --> 04:53.084
tumors in mice
and hyperactivity in children, I can,

04:53.168 --> 04:54.586
but I think you get it.

04:54.669 --> 04:57.297
Trevin, if you guys are gonna hire me
to do these organic cookies,

04:57.380 --> 05:01.927
I have to have organic ingredients.
Just... Okay, please let me know.

05:07.516 --> 05:10.769
If you really wanna go crazy.
But you guys, we gotta be out of here

05:10.852 --> 05:13.230
in, like, 20 to 30 minutes
'cause then we're gonna go to lunch.

05:13.355 --> 05:15.023
- Okay?
- All right.

05:15.106 --> 05:16.399
Just pick one.

05:17.359 --> 05:18.485
Whoa!

05:18.568 --> 05:21.571
<i>I found the article.</i>
<i>I read the study.</i>

05:21.655 --> 05:25.659
What I want to know is the reason
that I don't want to have sex.

05:25.742 --> 05:30.413
Because I'm seeing him do the dishes
and clean, clean,

05:30.497 --> 05:33.208
would I be more into...
would I be, like, turned on

05:33.291 --> 05:35.418
if he was chopping wood or being manly?

05:35.502 --> 05:37.462
Am I gonna be all fired up
and want to do it?

05:37.546 --> 05:41.424
Or is this because
we're 15 years into a relationship?

05:43.301 --> 05:44.636
His libido...

05:44.719 --> 05:48.056
Any guy who's gonna be
turning 40 is-- He can't help it.

05:48.139 --> 05:50.350
Like, his cock
doesn't get rock hard.

05:50.433 --> 05:51.893
It's not like--

05:51.977 --> 05:54.854
Who wants to fuck, like,
a medium-hard cock?

05:54.980 --> 05:55.981
It's...

05:56.815 --> 05:58.650
I just, I...

05:58.733 --> 06:03.154
I knew that cock when it was... 20.

06:03.238 --> 06:06.449
It's... It was a very different--
All right, call me back.

06:06.533 --> 06:07.951
Just... just call me back.

06:08.034 --> 06:12.330
She's mapping my masculinity
as we speak, and I'm losing my mind.

06:12.414 --> 06:14.749
And it's all because
of your fucking husband.

06:14.833 --> 06:15.834
I'm sorry.

06:15.917 --> 06:18.628
And he just loves
to smell somebody's problems,

06:18.712 --> 06:21.214
smell your vulnerability,
and then go for it.

06:21.298 --> 06:22.549
- He does.
- He does!

06:22.632 --> 06:24.217
-I'm sorry.
-And it's obnoxious.

06:24.301 --> 06:25.760
Yes, it is.

06:25.844 --> 06:29.347
He pokes the bear.

06:29.431 --> 06:31.766
He doesn't poke the bear.
He, like, runs up to the bear

06:31.850 --> 06:34.519
and, like, tweaks its nipples
and smacks it in the face,

06:34.603 --> 06:36.438
and then says, like, "That guy did it."

06:36.563 --> 06:39.524
Yeah, yeah.

06:39.608 --> 06:42.444
Oh, God, marriage, it's, um--

06:42.527 --> 06:44.362
No, my marriage.

06:44.446 --> 06:50.076
With my insane, lovely,
beautiful, incredible, insane wife.

06:50.160 --> 06:53.788
Right. Right, but your...
your marvelously...

06:55.081 --> 06:57.626
-caring, wonderful wife who--
-Yes, caring wife

06:57.709 --> 07:01.129
who gave up her nascent career
as a theater artist

07:01.212 --> 07:04.633
and got a corporate gig
to support my theater habit,

07:04.716 --> 07:07.469
which has always been a problem
in our relationship,

07:07.552 --> 07:09.596
and I already have to overcome

07:09.679 --> 07:12.265
the "get a real job" thing
from my wife,

07:12.349 --> 07:14.726
and there's already
a fucking thing in our relationship

07:14.809 --> 07:16.853
about her wearing the pants
and her winning the money,

07:16.937 --> 07:21.024
and me taking care of her babies
and being, you know,

07:21.107 --> 07:22.400
the stay-at-home dad.

07:22.484 --> 07:25.570
I think, you know,
I think anytime when you have a marriage

07:25.654 --> 07:27.280
when you have someone
who's staying in the arts

07:27.364 --> 07:30.033
and someone who's kind of
firmly rooted...

07:30.116 --> 07:32.035
in the corporate community,

07:32.118 --> 07:35.038
you're always gonna have that battle
of imbalance,

07:35.121 --> 07:37.123
I think, no matter what the sex.

07:37.207 --> 07:39.376
And that's a very delicate, you know...

07:39.459 --> 07:41.127
-Well, exactly.
-...part in your marriage.

07:41.211 --> 07:44.047
-Exactly.
-I understand that, but I...

07:44.130 --> 07:48.093
I think right now,
you're focusing on something really...

07:48.176 --> 07:49.469
kind of marvelous, which--

07:49.552 --> 07:51.596
-What?
-Your play.

07:51.680 --> 07:53.014
Oh, right.

07:53.098 --> 07:55.642
- Which, if you'd like to talk about it...
- Which is--

07:55.725 --> 07:59.270
...I would, because I read it and I--

07:59.354 --> 08:01.731
Sure, yeah. I mean, of course.
That's why we're here. I, uh...

08:01.815 --> 08:03.483
-I took some notes.
-Oh, my God. Wow.

08:03.566 --> 08:06.820
I did. I really think
that there's something pretty...

08:07.737 --> 08:09.656
fantastic here.

08:11.282 --> 08:13.618
What are you gonna do tonight?

08:13.702 --> 08:14.953
Um, I'm actually really excited.

08:15.036 --> 08:18.331
I'm gonna watch this, uh,
documentary about slavery.

08:18.415 --> 08:21.292
Oh.

08:21.376 --> 08:24.170
If that doesn't sound appealing enough,
it's supposed to be, uh,

08:24.254 --> 08:26.548
three and a half hours long
and it's supposedly very academic.

08:26.631 --> 08:27.841
Oh, honey.

08:27.924 --> 08:30.510
Is that for your play

08:30.593 --> 08:32.178
-that you've been working on?
-Yeah, yeah.

08:32.262 --> 08:36.516
Supposedly, uh, the middle section's
all about 19th century America

08:36.599 --> 08:39.519
and the Emancipation Proclamation
and the Civil War.

08:42.272 --> 08:43.857
So proud of you.

08:45.108 --> 08:46.776
-I just...
-Thanks.

08:47.736 --> 08:52.949
I just think you're really, really
such a special...

08:53.950 --> 08:56.619
beautiful actor...

08:56.703 --> 08:59.789
and person, and writer.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.876
And I just love you so much.

09:03.877 --> 09:04.961
Wow.

09:06.171 --> 09:08.965
That means so much.
Thank you for saying that.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.760
<i>You're under</i>
<i>my spell now, Officer.</i>

09:53.843 --> 09:55.512
<i>You'll do anything I want.</i>

10:20.995 --> 10:22.497
<i>- Ooh.</i>
<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>

10:22.580 --> 10:24.833
<i>Ooh!</i>

10:46.646 --> 10:49.315
- Wow!
- Oh, Jesus!

10:49.399 --> 10:51.317
-This is a great documentary.
-Oh, my God.

10:51.401 --> 10:54.404
-This is the slave documentary that you--
-No. No.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.826
Oh, my God!

11:00.952 --> 11:03.913
"Oh, I'm just gonna
go watch a slave documentary."

11:03.997 --> 11:05.206
- Shut up.
- "Uh, excuse me."

11:05.290 --> 11:07.125
I really was coming down--
No.

11:07.208 --> 11:08.459
Come here.

11:08.543 --> 11:10.211
-Hi.
-I need to see this.

11:10.295 --> 11:11.546
-You need to turn it back on.
-No, we are not.

11:11.629 --> 11:13.339
You need to turn it back on
right fuckin' now.

11:13.423 --> 11:14.924
-I'm not turning it back on.
-Turn it on.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.677
No. No. No.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.804
Come on.

11:19.888 --> 11:21.264
No, that's not--
It's not what you think.

11:21.347 --> 11:23.266
-I wasn't... I wasn't--
-Wait, wait, wait, watch this.

11:25.184 --> 11:28.605
- What was that?
- It was her hair toss.

11:29.856 --> 11:32.317
- Oh, you like that?
- Do it again. Yeah.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.904
It looks like you have water in your ear.

11:35.987 --> 11:40.033
Like you've been swimming.
You're, like, tryin' to get--

11:40.116 --> 11:42.660
I just...

11:42.744 --> 11:45.413
I know that you're gonna
lord this over me...

11:45.496 --> 11:46.956
-I'm not gonna lord it over you.
-And I just wanna--

11:47.040 --> 11:50.335
Okay. I'm--
I'll cop to getting caught.

11:50.418 --> 11:53.338
-Literally with my hand...
-I'm not gonna lord it over you.

11:53.421 --> 11:55.381
-...down my pants, but--
-I'll lord my pussy over you.

11:57.467 --> 12:01.054
The fucking algorithm
showed me that thing instead.

12:01.137 --> 12:04.015
-Mmm-hmm, I'm gonna show you this thing.
-No, you see, this isn't--

12:04.098 --> 12:05.433
It's not even representative
of what I'm into.

12:05.516 --> 12:08.269
I'm not into, like, big boobs.
I'm not...

12:12.273 --> 12:15.276
What are you--
What are you doing right now?

12:15.360 --> 12:17.111
Showing you my pussy.

12:17.195 --> 12:19.697
I'm well--
I know your pussy.

12:25.411 --> 12:28.831
- Do you like that?
- Yeah.

12:28.915 --> 12:31.793
"Uh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, I like it."

12:36.172 --> 12:37.340
Oh, yeah?

12:41.928 --> 12:44.555
It's just really important to me
that that doesn't become a thing.

12:45.723 --> 12:47.684
'Cause you're all fucking
hot and bothered right now,

12:47.767 --> 12:48.935
-but tomorrow you're gonna be, like...
-Oh, God.

12:49.018 --> 12:51.145
"Are you really watching
a documentary, Kyle?"

12:51.229 --> 12:54.273
You're, like, really bumming me out.

12:54.357 --> 12:56.359
-Okay.
-Good night.

12:57.276 --> 13:00.613
We have firefighter,
construction worker, pilot--

13:00.697 --> 13:02.031
Let's try construction worker.

13:04.951 --> 13:07.203
- Comes with its own...
- Oh, my God.

13:07.286 --> 13:08.579
...full leather belt.

13:08.663 --> 13:10.164
- Plus--
- Is the belt real leather?

13:10.248 --> 13:12.875
Not at that price.
Absolutely not.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.010
- Hey, guys.
- Hi. How you doin'?

13:22.093 --> 13:23.720
-Good.
-Hey, look at you guys.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.847
Oh, my gosh,
you have a bacon boy.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.932
Yeah, I had to convince him
to wear it, too.

13:28.016 --> 13:30.143
-What? Little Red Riding Hood.
-You guys look great.

13:30.226 --> 13:31.352
Thank you so much for doing this.

13:31.436 --> 13:32.979
-Oh, it's not a problem. Honestly.
-We're just having

13:33.062 --> 13:35.481
a little special dinner
and I really, really appreciate it.

13:35.565 --> 13:36.649
I understand completely.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.067
-Enjoy yourselves.
-Thank you.

13:43.114 --> 13:45.950
Yes!

13:47.535 --> 13:49.203
Oh!

13:49.287 --> 13:52.081
-Yes.
-No. I feel ridiculous.

13:52.165 --> 13:55.293
-Honey, you look so hot.
-This is crazy.

13:55.376 --> 13:57.253
I don't feel hot.
I feel really embarrassed.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.005
Honey, I'm, like, fired up already.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.798
-I'm feeling... Yeah.
-Are you serious? This?

14:00.882 --> 14:03.468
Like, I feel something going on
in my pants.

14:03.551 --> 14:07.013
Okay, but could this wait
until after trick-or-treating?

14:07.096 --> 14:08.473
-No, this is gonna be so much better--
-Please.

14:08.556 --> 14:10.349
It's gonna be amazing.
I promise you, okay?

14:10.433 --> 14:11.976
-I just love Halloween.
-You're not gonna believe it.

14:12.060 --> 14:13.436
It's gonna be so good.
I gotta get ready.

14:14.562 --> 14:17.315
At least let me hand out
some candy to the...

14:18.357 --> 14:21.235
the kids who come by.
I've decorated the whole...

14:22.695 --> 14:24.405
lawn and everything.

14:38.753 --> 14:41.005
Yoo-hoo!

14:41.089 --> 14:43.383
Hi, there, Mr. Handyman.

14:43.466 --> 14:46.302
-Well, ma'am, I, uh--
-Thanks for comin' by.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.679
What? Why are you laughing?

14:48.763 --> 14:50.181
What is that voice you're doing?
It's so fake.

14:50.264 --> 14:51.265
It's my char--

14:51.349 --> 14:53.017
-I'm a professional theater actor, okay?
-It's--

14:53.101 --> 14:54.769
This has to feel real, other--

14:54.852 --> 14:55.812
Oh, my God.

14:55.937 --> 14:57.355
-What?
-Come on. Just--

14:57.438 --> 14:59.732
First of all,
I'm a construction worker, right?

14:59.816 --> 15:01.442
So why am I fixing your sink?

15:01.526 --> 15:03.361
Construction workers don't come
into people's homes.

15:03.444 --> 15:04.904
I don't know. 'Cause you're my neighbor
and you're--

15:04.987 --> 15:06.072
You're helping me out.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.825
'Cause I'm a hot lady
and you wanna get in my pants.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.744
So I'm doing you a favor
or are you hiring me for this?

15:11.828 --> 15:15.289
-You're doing me a favor.
-Okay.

15:15.373 --> 15:18.209
-How long have you lived next door to me?
-Ten years.

15:18.292 --> 15:19.752
Great. Thank you.

15:19.836 --> 15:22.463
- Are you ready?
- Yep.

15:24.715 --> 15:27.677
Yoo-hoo!

15:27.760 --> 15:30.930
-Hi, neighbor.
-Hi.

15:31.013 --> 15:32.765
So nice to have you around.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.809
Have a man around.

15:34.892 --> 15:36.561
-Of course, no problem.
-Fixin' things.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.146
Sure.

15:38.229 --> 15:40.731
My husband's been out of town for so--

15:42.483 --> 15:45.194
Oh, my God, this is Trevin.
I'm so sorry, honey, I have to get this.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.320
-Seriously? You're gonna--
-Yes.

15:46.404 --> 15:47.780
-It's just-- It'll be two seconds.
-What?

15:47.864 --> 15:49.407
Hold on. Real quick.

15:49.490 --> 15:51.534
Trevin? Hey.

15:51.617 --> 15:54.036
How-- Did you hear--

15:54.120 --> 15:55.663
Really?

15:55.746 --> 16:00.168
I'm shocked, because how many times
have we been down this road and--

16:00.251 --> 16:02.295
Tom? What's up?

16:02.378 --> 16:04.881
Why have an organic--
Why go organic...

16:04.964 --> 16:06.132
-Oh, no.
-...and non-GMO, and like,

16:06.215 --> 16:08.050
why go down this road

16:08.134 --> 16:10.094
-talking to the farm--
-Can you hold on one sec, buddy?

16:10.178 --> 16:12.722
I gotta go.
Penny scraped her knee. Just--

16:12.805 --> 16:14.724
I just don't think we can do it
with a pomegranate.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.767
No, we're-- Yep.
No, thanks for dealing with that, buddy.

16:16.851 --> 16:18.936
-I promise I'll be right there. Bye.
-Can I call you back?

16:19.061 --> 16:21.939
Look, just let me call you back.
Okay. Okay, bye.

16:22.023 --> 16:24.192
-What's going on?
-Penny scraped her knee trick-or-treating,

16:24.275 --> 16:26.235
-and she's crying.
-Oh, no! Is she okay?

16:26.319 --> 16:27.528
I think she's fine
but she's freaking out.

16:27.612 --> 16:28.654
Is it really bad?

16:28.738 --> 16:30.865
I don't think it's really bad,
but she, like, wants me to come,

16:30.948 --> 16:32.617
and Tom doesn't want to deal with it,
so I'm gonna--

16:32.700 --> 16:33.993
-Oh, shit.
-That sounds really important.

16:34.076 --> 16:35.495
Why don't you call Trevin back
and I'll...

16:35.578 --> 16:36.621
It's a total fucking nightmare.

16:36.704 --> 16:39.707
-I'll be back in, like, ten minutes.
-Okay. All right. Hurry back.

16:39.790 --> 16:40.958
<i>Oh, here's Daddy.</i>

16:41.042 --> 16:42.752
-Dad's here! Yay!
-Hey!

16:42.835 --> 16:43.961
- Daddy.
- Hurray!

16:44.045 --> 16:45.296
-Hey, Tom. Hey, guys.
-Hey, Dad.

16:45.379 --> 16:47.215
-Hey, I'm sorry to have to pull you out.
-Hi. Oh, no worries.

16:47.298 --> 16:49.300
I just think she really wanted to see Dad,
you know what I mean?

16:49.383 --> 16:51.552
-Of course. Totally.
-But look, if she's okay

16:51.636 --> 16:54.222
and they're up for it,
we can stay out. I don't mind.

16:54.305 --> 16:55.681
-Yeah? You sure?
-Yeah, yeah, not a problem.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.016
-Still early. Sure.
-Oh, my God.

16:57.099 --> 16:58.768
That's great. I'm probably gonna
take you up on that.

16:58.851 --> 16:59.852
Okay. Let me know.

16:59.936 --> 17:01.521
Okay. Hi!

17:01.604 --> 17:03.898
Hi. What happened, sweetie?

17:03.981 --> 17:05.858
-I fell.
-Aw!

17:05.942 --> 17:07.401
You okay?

17:08.402 --> 17:10.404
Is it your knee?
Can I see it?

17:10.488 --> 17:14.742
-Why are you dressed that way?
-What? It's my Halloween costume.

17:14.825 --> 17:16.619
I'm a construction worker.

17:16.702 --> 17:19.288
Oh, yeah, that looks like
that must've hurt.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.415
-You feel better now?
-A little.

17:21.499 --> 17:24.460
A little?
Do you feel okay to trick-or-treat?

17:24.544 --> 17:26.295
Halloween is the best night of the year.

17:29.715 --> 17:34.053
Ma'am? Ma'am, it's the handyman.
I'm here to fix your sink.

17:34.136 --> 17:36.222
Oh! Thank God.

17:36.305 --> 17:39.308
I've been all alone and helpless.

17:39.392 --> 17:42.979
-Oh.
-So nice to have a big strong man around.

17:43.062 --> 17:46.816
-I'm glad I could help, I, uh--
-I'm just a weak little lady.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.734
-Hmm.
-Something's wrong with my sink.

17:48.818 --> 17:50.611
Well, let's take a look.

17:50.695 --> 17:51.988
-Can I?
-Oh!

17:52.071 --> 17:53.114
Can you show...

17:53.197 --> 17:56.367
Yeah, there does seem to be
something wrong with that sink.

17:56.450 --> 17:58.995
Oh, shit! I'm sorry.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.622
-Hold on one second, my phone's ringing.
-All right.

18:01.706 --> 18:05.293
Uh, it's Tom with the kids.

18:05.376 --> 18:07.837
Just let me quickly nip this
in the bud, um--

18:07.920 --> 18:09.547
Hey. Hi, bud.

18:12.133 --> 18:15.261
Hey, Allen, listen, buddy.
I need you to help me out.

18:15.344 --> 18:17.054
- Trevin.
- Your sister will listen to you.

18:17.138 --> 18:19.056
Just tell her there's nothing
to be afraid of,

18:19.140 --> 18:22.226
that Halloween is fun,
and that everybody's costumes are fake.

18:22.310 --> 18:24.687
That wasn't a real vampire.
I mean--

18:24.770 --> 18:27.523
- ...speak tomorrow in the office.
- I know.

18:27.607 --> 18:30.318
Look, if you're having a good time,
she'll have a good time.

18:30.401 --> 18:33.070
Thank you. Bye.

18:33.154 --> 18:35.573
- Yes? All good?
- All good.

18:35.656 --> 18:39.410
All right.
Let's get back to business.

18:41.245 --> 18:42.413
Oh.

18:43.372 --> 18:45.708
Oh, that, uh... good sink.

18:49.587 --> 18:51.255
God damn it!

18:54.717 --> 18:58.137
I'll trade you these Twix,

18:58.220 --> 19:01.766
Rolo, Kit-Kat, and Tootsie Roll

19:01.849 --> 19:03.768
for one of those.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.438
No deal.

19:07.521 --> 19:09.774
And Hershey's.

19:09.857 --> 19:11.442
No deal.

19:11.525 --> 19:12.985
- And Rolo.
- No deal.

19:14.195 --> 19:15.946
Fine, and then another Hershey's.
I mean--

19:16.030 --> 19:17.990
- No deal.
- Oh, my God.

19:18.074 --> 19:21.035
I'm never trading these.

19:21.118 --> 19:24.121
I'll trade you
two of these for that.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.505
Good night.

19:36.634 --> 19:37.718
Hey, pal.

19:38.636 --> 19:43.349
Sometimes if somebody gets scared,
we might think it's, like, ridiculous.

19:43.432 --> 19:45.184
There's nothin' to be scared about.

19:45.267 --> 19:48.104
But I need you, for your sister,
to be there for her.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.481
All right? And help her out.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.108
Just like Mom and I are there
for each other

19:52.191 --> 19:56.195
if the other person is upset or gets hurt.

19:56.278 --> 19:57.655
So even if Mom and I aren't there,

19:57.738 --> 20:01.075
I'm gonna look to you as her big brother
to take care of her.

20:01.158 --> 20:02.368
Does that make sense?

20:03.953 --> 20:05.454
-Yep.
-Cool.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.123
That's all I was trying to say.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.544
-Okay.
-Did you have a good Halloween?

20:11.627 --> 20:13.087
-Yeah.
-All right.

20:15.965 --> 20:18.175
Any secret candy in here anywhere? Huh?

20:18.259 --> 20:19.969
- No.
- Good night.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.637
-Good night.
-Love you.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.222
Love you, too.

20:29.687 --> 20:31.897
-He is such a sweet boy.
-Hmm.

20:32.815 --> 20:34.942
-Thanks for taking care of that.
-Sure.

20:35.943 --> 20:37.737
No problem.

20:45.703 --> 20:48.205
- Mmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

21:06.974 --> 21:09.935
I'm just--

21:44.845 --> 21:45.971
Oh!

21:50.142 --> 21:52.686
- You feel that?
- Yeah.

21:55.022 --> 21:58.359
-Yeah. You like that?
-Yeah.

22:19.713 --> 22:21.924
Oh, fuck yeah.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.884
Oh, yeah.

22:23.968 --> 22:25.636
Oh, fuck.

22:25.719 --> 22:28.305
You got me so hard.

22:28.389 --> 22:30.683
-Oh, yeah.
-Fuck, yes.

22:41.026 --> 22:43.487
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
