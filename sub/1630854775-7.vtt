(engine rumbling)

00:10.135 --> 00:13.388
(rock music playing)

00:18.643 --> 00:21.354
* *

00:22.105 --> 00:23.773
(engine revving)

00:31.781 --> 00:33.491
(whirring)

00:35.076 --> 00:38.079
(engine revving)

00:38.121 --> 00:39.622
(whirring)

00:42.083 --> 00:43.710
Announcer: (over speakers)
Welcome, everyone,

00:43.752 --> 00:45.170
to Peach Tree Speedway,

00:45.211 --> 00:48.214
where today's race
is crucial in determining

00:48.256 --> 00:51.343
this year's
Late Model champion.

00:51.384 --> 00:54.054
Will it be the brash newcomer
and points leader

00:54.095 --> 00:56.056
Davis McDowell?

00:56.097 --> 00:58.600
(cheering and applause)

00:58.641 --> 01:01.478
Or the veteran Keith Owens,
in his final season,

01:01.519 --> 01:04.230
just five points back
in second place?

01:04.272 --> 01:07.067
(cheering and applause)

01:07.108 --> 01:09.861
The youngster McDowell
has been giving Owens

01:09.903 --> 01:11.237
more than he can handle.

01:11.279 --> 01:12.906
There is certainly
no love lost

01:12.947 --> 01:15.367
between these two drivers.

01:15.408 --> 01:17.327
Owens has got a lot
to live up to.

01:17.369 --> 01:21.164
His father and his grandfather
were both racing legends.

01:21.206 --> 01:23.249
He has got to be feeling
the weight of that legacy

01:23.291 --> 01:25.251
on his shoulders
right now.

01:25.293 --> 01:28.630
Drivers, start your engines.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.341
(engines revving)

01:31.383 --> 01:33.093
Greg: (over radio)
Smooth and steady, partner,

01:33.134 --> 01:34.177
just like we talked about.

01:34.219 --> 01:36.221
Don't worry about
that little shit.

01:36.262 --> 01:38.640
Just race your race.

01:39.933 --> 01:44.312
(high-pitched whine)

01:45.563 --> 01:46.648
(cheering)

01:46.690 --> 01:48.316
(engines revving)

01:49.359 --> 01:50.985
Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:51.027 --> 01:54.072
the field is stacking up
behind the leader.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.907
They're heading
for the start line.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.701
The green flag is out.

01:58.827 --> 01:59.828
And they're off!

01:59.869 --> 02:02.372
(engines rumbling)

02:15.385 --> 02:18.596
Owens finds a gap
and goes for the front.

02:22.934 --> 02:24.936
McDowell follows
on the inside.

02:33.653 --> 02:35.947
Okay, Keith,
show that kid who's boss.

02:41.036 --> 02:43.204
Announcer:
Owens takes an early lead.

02:43.246 --> 02:44.456
That was your
fastest lap of the day.

02:44.497 --> 02:46.249
Just hold her straight.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.422
Announcer:
The white flag is out.

02:52.464 --> 02:53.840
It's the final lap.

02:53.882 --> 02:57.552
Owens leads, but McDowell
is in hot pursuit.

02:59.387 --> 03:00.930
(engine revving)

03:09.939 --> 03:12.567
McDowell makes his move
and switches to the outside

03:12.609 --> 03:14.944
as they head down
turn three.

03:14.986 --> 03:16.863
(crowd cheering)

03:18.406 --> 03:20.950
They're heading
into the final quarter.

03:20.992 --> 03:23.036
It's anyone's race.

03:23.078 --> 03:25.830
(high-pitched whine)

03:29.501 --> 03:31.670
Oh no, they've hit!

03:31.711 --> 03:34.214
McDowell with a bump
on the back side.

03:34.255 --> 03:37.050
Owens in a spin,
trying to come out of it.

03:37.092 --> 03:39.427
And he's not
going to be able to.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.640
Owens' race is over.

03:46.434 --> 03:48.395
(crowd cheering)

03:48.436 --> 03:51.314
And Davis McDowell
will take the checkered flag.

03:51.356 --> 03:52.857
-Yes!
-Announcer: What a finish!

03:52.899 --> 03:55.485
(cheering, applauding)

03:55.527 --> 03:58.988
I can imagine Owens
will be pretty heated
after that move.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.281
But for the moment,

04:00.323 --> 04:02.742
it looks like McDowell
secures the win

04:02.784 --> 04:06.037
and extends his lead
in the championship.

04:07.997 --> 04:11.459
(crowd cheering)

04:12.002 --> 04:15.338
* *

04:19.801 --> 04:22.262
McDowell's a hothead
and an idiot.

04:22.303 --> 04:24.055
These kids, the way
they're racing today,

04:24.097 --> 04:25.306
it's ruining the sport.

04:25.348 --> 04:26.474
Reporter:
So are you happy
to be walking away?

04:26.516 --> 04:27.600
I'm not walking away.

04:27.642 --> 04:28.643
Reporter 2:
Wait, you're not?

04:28.685 --> 04:30.020
Because rumors
of your retirement--

04:30.061 --> 04:32.022
That's all
just speculation.

04:32.063 --> 04:33.565
I'm not retiring.

04:33.606 --> 04:35.191
Owenses never quit.
Y'all know that.

04:35.233 --> 04:36.776
-You know about this?
-Nope.

04:36.818 --> 04:38.737
-Any other questions?
-Davis: Hey!

04:38.778 --> 04:40.572
You're the one ruining
the sport, old timer.

04:40.613 --> 04:42.949
How about you want to get
the fuck out of the way? Hmm?

04:42.991 --> 04:45.201
How's it feel to be
the third best Keith
in the family?

04:45.243 --> 04:47.370
Bet Daddy wishes
he named you something else.

04:51.875 --> 04:54.002
I shouldn't have
called him an idiot.

04:54.044 --> 04:56.629
The kid is worse
than an idiot.

04:56.671 --> 04:59.299
There's something
dark in there.
Gave me the shivers.

04:59.341 --> 05:01.676
Just makes me seem
like a sore loser.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.511
You got punched,

05:03.553 --> 05:05.221
and now you're icing
your face.

05:05.263 --> 05:06.806
You are literally
a sore loser.

05:06.848 --> 05:08.683
Katy,
that is not called for.

05:08.725 --> 05:12.395
That's all just speculation.
I'm not retiring.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.814
Owenses never quit.
Y'all know that.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.531
Hey. Hey!

05:24.866 --> 05:26.493
Neither of you
comes in this house

05:26.534 --> 05:27.994
until you work
this shit out.

05:29.371 --> 05:30.830
We had an agreement.

05:30.872 --> 05:33.166
You said you were going to
retire at the end of the season,

05:33.208 --> 05:34.459
and then it's my turn.

05:34.501 --> 05:35.460
Things change.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.170
That's bullshit.
You promised.

05:37.212 --> 05:39.047
If I win
this last race,

05:39.089 --> 05:40.757
I can still take
the championship.

05:40.799 --> 05:42.634
I know you're anxious
to get out there--

05:42.676 --> 05:44.469
Katy:
Dad, I have been
waiting to do this

05:44.511 --> 05:46.388
since the day
I was born.

05:47.389 --> 05:49.849
You know,
Davis was right.

05:49.891 --> 05:52.060
You need to learn
to get out of the fuckin' way.

05:53.269 --> 05:54.479
Hey!

05:56.189 --> 05:59.901
(tires squealing)

06:00.819 --> 06:03.446
(engine revving)

06:10.036 --> 06:13.081
* *

06:24.676 --> 06:26.344
You could have given us
a heads-up.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.512
I know.

06:28.555 --> 06:29.681
You promised her.

06:29.723 --> 06:32.559
And I feel terrible
about that.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.395
But an Owens
can't retire a loser.

06:35.437 --> 06:37.397
How's that
gonna help Katy?

06:37.439 --> 06:39.232
Don't act like
this is about Katy.

06:39.274 --> 06:41.443
I lost my flow, Donna.

06:43.194 --> 06:44.446
Mid-season.

06:46.865 --> 06:49.743
I can't get out
of my own head.

06:49.784 --> 06:51.745
I hear, "Drivers,
start your engines,"

06:51.786 --> 06:53.997
and all I can think is
there's somebody out there

06:54.039 --> 06:55.165
that's better than me.

06:56.291 --> 06:57.584
I've lost the damn race

06:57.625 --> 06:59.961
before they even drop
the green flag.

07:00.003 --> 07:01.463
(horn honking)

07:04.841 --> 07:06.551
Davis:
Hey, guys, Davis here.

07:06.593 --> 07:07.635
I know the race is over,

07:07.677 --> 07:09.429
but I felt like making
one last pitstop.

07:09.471 --> 07:11.097
-Baby...
-To Keith Owens'
front yard.

07:11.139 --> 07:13.808
Keith:
...do me a favor and go
and fetch my shotgun.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.810
Hey, no need, ma'am.
I'm going.

07:18.980 --> 07:20.607
(engine revving)

07:22.317 --> 07:24.486
I just planted
those motherfuckers.

07:31.743 --> 07:34.788
Keith, you fuck
this flow nonsense.

07:34.829 --> 07:37.248
You get out there
and you beat
that evil little shit.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.878
* *

08:30.677 --> 08:33.430
(phone beeping)

08:33.471 --> 08:35.056
(line ringing)

08:35.098 --> 08:36.725
-Woman: (over phone) Hello.
-Hey there.

08:36.766 --> 08:40.353
Uh, can I get a tow truck
on Deep Springs Road

08:40.395 --> 08:41.604
by the bend?

08:41.646 --> 08:43.189
Woman:
You break down
or somethin'?

08:43.231 --> 08:44.899
Yeah. Car won't start.

09:47.962 --> 09:50.965
* *

09:59.432 --> 10:00.892
(creaking)

10:00.934 --> 10:01.976
(click)

10:31.339 --> 10:32.966
Alright.
Smooth and steady.

10:33.008 --> 10:35.301
Just practice.
No need to take chances.

10:35.343 --> 10:36.344
Got it.

10:42.726 --> 10:44.227
(engine starts)

10:53.445 --> 10:55.447
(engine revving)

11:17.218 --> 11:21.139
* *

11:30.774 --> 11:35.362
(heartbeat thumping)

11:41.159 --> 11:43.161
(all gasp)

11:52.587 --> 11:55.340
(fire crackling)

12:04.724 --> 12:06.184
Man:
Keith!

12:09.145 --> 12:11.815
-He alright?
-Greg: No, no, no. No.

12:21.491 --> 12:22.742
Charlie:
Ah, geez.

12:24.619 --> 12:25.995
Ah.

12:26.037 --> 12:28.623
Hey, Randy, so some kid
went full Linda Blair

12:28.665 --> 12:30.083
on the number seven car.

12:30.125 --> 12:32.293
Shit, that ain't nothin'.
I found a whole dook once.

12:32.335 --> 12:34.045
Oh wow. Something
to look forward to.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.588
(announcer on radio,
indistinct)

12:35.630 --> 12:37.007
Hey Jean,

12:37.048 --> 12:39.259
you got to wear these
around your neck or something.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.302
I mean,
this is the second time
I found them this week.

12:41.344 --> 12:43.471
Announcer:
...and around as they head
down the straightaway.

12:43.513 --> 12:45.181
You don't want to go
watch this on the big screen?

12:45.223 --> 12:47.183
I know.
I'm just so nervous.

12:47.225 --> 12:49.144
That's my boy out there.
I can't watch.

12:49.185 --> 12:51.021
Wait,
that's your kid racing?

12:51.062 --> 12:52.063
Jean: Mm-hmm.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.232
-No shit!
-Yeah, shit.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.651
Announcer:
McDowell crosses
the line first

12:56.693 --> 12:57.861
and wins
the Peach Tree Speedway!

12:57.902 --> 13:00.655
-Oh! He did it!
-Hey!

13:00.697 --> 13:03.158
Okay. Now I can watch.

13:03.199 --> 13:05.326
Announcer:
An amazing victory
for the young...

13:05.368 --> 13:06.828
-(crowd applauding)
-Charlie: Jean!

13:06.870 --> 13:08.872
Davis did it again, Jean.

13:08.913 --> 13:10.749
Ahh.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.251
-Are they going
to interview him?
-Yeah, I guess.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.420
Owenses never quit.
Y'all know that.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.922
Randy:
Looks like they're
doing Owens first.

13:17.964 --> 13:19.966
Why are they interviewing
the loser first?

13:20.008 --> 13:21.176
Yeah, it's kind of
messed up.

13:21.217 --> 13:24.137
I bet Davis is not
too happy about that.

13:24.179 --> 13:26.097
Bet Daddy wishes
he named you something else.

13:27.015 --> 13:28.141
Come on!
Come on!

13:28.183 --> 13:29.684
Randy: Yep.
Not too happy at all.

13:29.726 --> 13:31.269
Shit.
Boom goes the dynamite.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.730
Yeesh.
So that's your kid, huh?

13:33.772 --> 13:35.440
Real Manny Pacquiao
up there.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.984
(grunting)

13:38.026 --> 13:41.237
(children chattering)

13:41.279 --> 13:43.531
-Hey, no running!
-Boy: I'm not!

13:49.496 --> 13:51.456
Oh, can I have
your autograph?

13:51.498 --> 13:52.624
Sure, man.

13:54.209 --> 13:55.960
-Y'all want some peaches?
-Thanks.

13:56.002 --> 13:59.130
-Help yourselves.
-I've seen every race
this season, Mr. McDowell.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.507
Davis: Come on, now.
Y'all call me Davis.

14:00.548 --> 14:03.134
You smoked Keith Owens
and punched him in the face.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.969
Fuck that guy, man.
It was baller.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.554
No need for that now.
I lost my cool.

14:06.596 --> 14:08.556
And the truth is,
Owens ain't a bad guy.

14:08.598 --> 14:10.767
Now, who wants to see
my lucky charm?

14:10.809 --> 14:12.227
Kids:
Me, me, me, me.

14:14.771 --> 14:16.856
This is what it takes to win.

14:16.898 --> 14:20.652
Every race,
I've got my grandpa Big Ed
with me in the car.

14:20.694 --> 14:24.948
He taught me what it takes to be
a racecar driver and a good man.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.658
So who wants to sit
in the driver's seat?

14:26.700 --> 14:27.909
-Boy 1: Me, me, me, me.
-Boy 2: Come on.

14:27.951 --> 14:29.703
I'm first.
I got cancer.

14:29.744 --> 14:31.246
Bullshit.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.289
-What did you just say?
-You don't have cancer.

14:33.331 --> 14:35.417
-You don't have cancer,
you fucking liar.
-Nice try, dipshit.

14:35.458 --> 14:38.294
Charlie: Hey.
No need for all that.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.842
You know, if that kid
did have cancer,

14:43.883 --> 14:46.302
that could have gotten
real awkward real quick.

14:46.344 --> 14:48.096
Nah, I got this thing.

14:48.138 --> 14:50.515
I'm like the, the dog
that can smell, uh...

14:50.557 --> 14:52.183
Cancer?

14:52.225 --> 14:54.519
Uh, sure. Uh, yes.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.313
Uh, I'm like that
but with bullshit.

14:57.355 --> 14:59.190
You know,
I hear it, I know it.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.150
Could have been wrong.

15:00.191 --> 15:02.110
Well, stunning accuracy.

15:02.152 --> 15:03.653
Step right up.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.532
Here, let me...

15:07.574 --> 15:09.701
Oh. Oh no.
You don't have to, uh...

15:10.326 --> 15:11.453
(game music plays)

15:11.494 --> 15:13.872
Hey. Figure I'll help out
around here

15:13.913 --> 15:15.290
until a tow call comes in.

15:15.331 --> 15:18.376
So what, so you drive
a, a tow truck, huh?

15:18.418 --> 15:20.795
So racing isn't paying
the big bucks.

15:20.837 --> 15:22.047
You know
what I won today?

15:22.088 --> 15:23.840
Gas money and
a ceremonial bowl of peaches.

15:23.882 --> 15:27.052
This sport's rigged against
the little guys like me.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.803
You know, it takes
at least $75,000

15:28.845 --> 15:30.555
to keep a car
on the racetrack,
minimum.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.015
Keith Owens
probably spends

15:32.057 --> 15:34.809
ten times that much on his car,
and I still beat him.

15:34.851 --> 15:37.020
Good thing
he can't punch his way
out of a paper bag.

15:37.062 --> 15:39.397
-It barely hurts.
-Well, bullshit.

15:39.439 --> 15:42.025
-Uh, 'cause of
your thing, right?
-Yeah, because of that.

15:42.067 --> 15:44.444
Davis:
And now his daughter's
gonna waltz into the sport.

15:44.486 --> 15:46.780
She hasn't even raced
a late model. Not once.

15:46.821 --> 15:48.656
And sponsors are going to be
falling all over themselves,

15:48.698 --> 15:50.492
trying to get
their name on her car.

15:50.533 --> 15:52.786
Gosh, you really got
a lot of road rage bubbling

15:52.827 --> 15:54.996
under those bright eyes
of yours, huh, kid?

15:55.038 --> 15:56.498
Yeah, I guess so.

15:56.539 --> 15:57.665
So, uh, let me
ask you something.

15:57.707 --> 15:59.668
This whole, uh,
racing thing,

15:59.709 --> 16:02.170
I think I kind of
don't get it.

16:02.212 --> 16:04.005
Aren't you the one
with the '69 Barracuda

16:04.047 --> 16:05.006
in the parking lot?

16:05.048 --> 16:07.258
An all-American
muscle classic?

16:07.300 --> 16:09.636
Yes, but you see,
that, that gets me places,

16:09.678 --> 16:11.262
which is technically
what a car is for.

16:11.304 --> 16:14.265
You are just
going in circles.

16:14.307 --> 16:17.686
I mean, you're basically
just turning left

16:17.727 --> 16:19.270
a bunch of times.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.563
That's what you think?

16:21.898 --> 16:23.233
(coin clinking)

16:24.651 --> 16:27.320
Okay.
So just hit the gas
and turn left.

16:27.362 --> 16:28.863
How hard could it be?

16:28.905 --> 16:32.909
Well. Gotta say,
this is very, uh, intense

16:32.951 --> 16:35.286
with the haptics
and whatnot.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.497
Uh-huh.
Now accelerate.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.209
Geez, why am I
so afraid of crashing?

16:41.251 --> 16:43.086
I mean, it's just
an arcade game.

16:43.128 --> 16:45.046
Holy Toledo!
That was very close.

16:45.088 --> 16:46.381
Did you see that?
That was very close.

16:46.423 --> 16:47.924
Now, when you get to the end
of the front stretch,

16:47.966 --> 16:49.759
point the car
into the turn.

16:49.801 --> 16:52.721
-Towards the bottom
of the racetrack.
-Mm-hmm.

16:52.762 --> 16:54.055
(Charlie sighs)

16:54.097 --> 16:55.056
Alright.

16:55.098 --> 16:56.725
Is your foot
even on the gas?

16:56.766 --> 16:57.892
Don't distract me.

16:57.934 --> 16:59.227
Davis:
Okay, for this next turn,

16:59.269 --> 17:00.395
we need to do a fishhook,

17:00.437 --> 17:02.022
but you got
to trust the car.

17:02.063 --> 17:03.523
Do you trust the car?

17:03.565 --> 17:05.817
-Well, it's an arcade game.
-No, it isn't.

17:05.859 --> 17:09.320
You're on a dirt track,
engine screaming in your ears,

17:09.362 --> 17:12.240
crowd's roaring,
time's slowing down.

17:12.282 --> 17:13.783
Trust the car.

17:14.576 --> 17:16.745
I don't trust the car.

17:17.620 --> 17:18.496
Aah.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.540
Davis:
You gotta trust the car.

17:20.582 --> 17:22.709
Okay. Okay.
Fuck it. It's fake anyway.

17:22.751 --> 17:24.002
Good. Good, good.

17:24.044 --> 17:26.546
Faster. Faster.

17:26.588 --> 17:29.215
When I say,
slam on the gas hard
and turn hard. Ready?

17:29.257 --> 17:30.425
-I am not.
-Now!

17:30.467 --> 17:32.594
Charlie:
Ahhhh!

17:32.635 --> 17:34.929
Ooh. Ahh.

17:34.971 --> 17:36.973
Little bitch.

17:37.015 --> 17:38.308
-Terrible.
-Yes.

17:38.350 --> 17:39.434
-Bad.
-Bad.

17:39.476 --> 17:41.770
-F minus.
-Ah yeah.

17:41.811 --> 17:43.480
-Yeah.
-Geez.

17:43.521 --> 17:46.191
Okay. Okay. Okay.
You win. You win. You win.

17:46.232 --> 17:47.942
You know what,
fake racing is, uh,

17:47.984 --> 17:49.527
it's harder
than it looks.

17:51.571 --> 17:54.282
Oh, no, no, no, man.
Come on.

17:54.324 --> 17:56.618
Listen, kid, it's just
an arcade romance.

17:56.659 --> 17:59.079
It's, it's dumb.
It's, it's messy.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.205
It's self-defeating.

18:00.246 --> 18:01.623
No, you don't want this
in your life.

18:01.664 --> 18:04.834
-Worth a shot.
-Yes. I respect it.

18:04.876 --> 18:06.920
Katy:
Hey, tow truck!

18:06.961 --> 18:08.546
I know you're in here.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.465
I saw your
shitkicker outside.

18:10.507 --> 18:12.467
What's up, daddy's girl?
Shouldn't you be, like,

18:12.509 --> 18:13.968
painting your toenails
or some shit?

18:14.010 --> 18:16.304
Katy: What do you say
we settle this shit right now

18:16.346 --> 18:17.430
on the track?

18:17.472 --> 18:19.015
On the little track,
you mean?

18:19.057 --> 18:20.684
'Cause we know Daddy
won't let you get
in a big boy car.

18:20.725 --> 18:22.560
I can smoke your ass
on any track.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.521
-Come on then.
-Boy: Come on, guys.

18:24.562 --> 18:26.106
Now you get to see
the real thing.

18:26.147 --> 18:28.483
(excited chatter)

18:28.525 --> 18:29.776
Boy: Let's go!

18:34.864 --> 18:36.574
Go, go, go!

18:38.076 --> 18:39.244
(tires squealing)

18:39.285 --> 18:42.539
(engines puttering)

18:52.048 --> 18:54.009
-(crowd cheering)
-Whoa!

18:56.761 --> 18:58.054
Again?

18:58.930 --> 19:01.349
(engines puttering)

19:01.391 --> 19:02.851
(cheering)

19:03.935 --> 19:05.395
(tires squealing)

19:12.318 --> 19:13.445
Again?

19:14.112 --> 19:16.990
* *

19:23.913 --> 19:25.457
(crowd cheering)

19:25.498 --> 19:27.542
Get used to it,
Tow Truck.

19:27.584 --> 19:28.710
You're going to be losing
to my family

19:28.752 --> 19:30.170
for the rest of your life.

19:34.591 --> 19:37.635
Ooh. Hey, Jean.
You need a ride home?

19:39.179 --> 19:40.889
Geez,
what the fuck happened?

19:40.930 --> 19:43.433
He had that "about to do
something stupid" look.

20:00.033 --> 20:01.659
Davis: (on phone)
Hey, guys, Davis here.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.578
I know the race is over,
but I felt like making

20:03.620 --> 20:04.954
one last pitstop.

20:04.996 --> 20:06.581
-Really?
-I'm done.

20:06.623 --> 20:08.375
I'm done taking
that family's shit.

20:08.416 --> 20:09.793
You think about
your own family.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.503
What would Big Ed
say about this?

20:11.544 --> 20:12.712
He'd say,
"Hell yeah, boy.

20:12.754 --> 20:13.755
Take those fuckers out."

20:13.797 --> 20:15.590
Ah, ah, ah.
On the track.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.968
Big Ed had that
same devil inside him,

20:19.010 --> 20:21.262
but he put it all
behind the wheel.

20:21.304 --> 20:25.266
And that is what kept him
on the track and out of jail.

20:25.308 --> 20:27.102
Do it all
but on the track.

20:27.811 --> 20:28.770
Yes?

20:35.151 --> 20:36.152
(door closes)

20:40.115 --> 20:42.534
(phone ringing)

20:46.413 --> 20:47.497
Hello.

20:50.375 --> 20:51.960
Did you break down
or somethin'?

20:53.336 --> 20:55.046
Alright. Give me 15.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.301
That was a tow call.

21:00.343 --> 21:01.803
-I'm on it. I got it.
-Oh no, no.

21:01.845 --> 21:03.388
You ain't going
anywhere.

21:03.430 --> 21:05.515
You need to cool off
and sober up.

21:05.557 --> 21:07.142
And first thing tomorrow,
you're going to fix

21:07.183 --> 21:09.144
the Owens' mailbox
and apologize.

21:11.771 --> 21:14.232
Now where are
my goddamn keys.

21:30.165 --> 21:33.043
-(microwave beeping)
-(popcorn popping)

21:34.836 --> 21:36.087
Oh shit.

21:38.173 --> 21:39.215
Shit.

21:49.642 --> 21:50.810
(metallic clang)

23:27.532 --> 23:30.952
* *

24:10.116 --> 24:12.577
Greg:
Smooth and steady.
Just practice.

24:12.619 --> 24:14.162
No need to take chances.

24:14.204 --> 24:16.623
There she is.
America's sweetheart.

24:16.664 --> 24:18.500
(Katy scoffs)

24:18.541 --> 24:20.168
You're not talking to me?

24:20.210 --> 24:22.796
Okay. I'm sorry
for jacking your mailbox.

24:22.837 --> 24:25.173
I was pissed, even though
it was just go-karts.

24:25.215 --> 24:26.800
I don't care
if it's fucking big wheels.

24:26.841 --> 24:28.510
When it comes to racing,
I'll kick your ass

24:28.551 --> 24:29.761
anytime, anywhere.

24:29.803 --> 24:31.554
You ain't kicking shit
until Daddy hands over

24:31.596 --> 24:32.555
the keys
to the money wagon.

24:32.597 --> 24:34.015
-Fuck off.
-Davis: Look,

24:34.057 --> 24:36.810
we can sit here
and talk shit all day long,

24:36.851 --> 24:39.396
or we can settle this
once and for all.

24:41.106 --> 24:44.275
Last week,
I went around here
in 20.3 seconds.

24:45.485 --> 24:46.986
You think you could beat it?

24:48.321 --> 24:49.739
Be my guest.

24:50.573 --> 24:53.034
Come on.
Just a practice lap.

24:53.076 --> 24:55.078
Better hurry and suit up
before I change my mind.

24:58.498 --> 25:00.750
(engines rumbling)

25:08.508 --> 25:10.051
Jean:
What's happening, Randy?

25:10.093 --> 25:13.221
He's out there on the track,
taking her easy.

25:13.263 --> 25:15.890
And Owens is
really trying to goad him.

25:15.932 --> 25:18.143
Alright. They're coming
into the first straightaway.

25:35.368 --> 25:36.995
(all gasp)

25:39.039 --> 25:41.082
Reporter:
We have just witnessed
Davis McDowell's car

25:41.124 --> 25:43.084
smash into the wall
at turn one.

25:44.044 --> 25:46.296
He doesn't appear
to be moving.

25:47.589 --> 25:49.382
This is not looking good.

25:51.634 --> 25:53.303
Jean: Davis!

25:58.391 --> 25:59.976
Greg:
Kate!

26:03.104 --> 26:05.106
-He alright?
-Greg: No, no, no.

26:06.358 --> 26:08.109
Keith...

26:08.151 --> 26:09.569
Katy was
in the car.

26:12.322 --> 26:14.866
* *

26:19.162 --> 26:22.207
Jean: Honey!
Oh, thank God.

26:22.248 --> 26:25.335
-Oh, my God. Okay.
-I'm alright, Mom.
I'm alright.

26:28.380 --> 26:30.840
* *

27:01.162 --> 27:02.372
(sighs)

27:04.416 --> 27:06.459
Jesus.

27:06.501 --> 27:08.461
Reporter: (on TV)
As many of you
already know,

27:08.503 --> 27:11.172
19-year-old Katy Owens
is in a coma

27:11.214 --> 27:14.467
at Glencoe Memorial Hospital
after a horrible crash

27:14.509 --> 27:16.886
during practice yesterday
at Peach Tree Speedway.

27:16.928 --> 27:18.805
They're saying
her seat belt failed.

27:18.847 --> 27:21.766
Oh. What do you mean?
Like, her seatbelt didn't work?

27:21.808 --> 27:24.728
-It failed.
-What does that even mean?

27:24.769 --> 27:28.106
It gave way.
That's, that's why
the injury was so severe.

27:28.148 --> 27:30.400
In the meantime,
we wish Katy a speedy recovery,

27:30.442 --> 27:32.027
and we're keeping
the Owens family

27:32.068 --> 27:33.403
in our thoughts
and prayers.

27:34.112 --> 27:35.238
God.

27:35.280 --> 27:36.406
What the hell
was Davis thinking

27:36.448 --> 27:38.116
letting her
drive that car?

27:38.158 --> 27:39.409
Hey, Mom.

27:42.704 --> 27:44.497
I just spent
the last two hours

27:44.539 --> 27:46.416
getting the third degree
about Katy's crash.

27:46.458 --> 27:48.626
And now they're talking
about suspending me.

27:48.668 --> 27:49.586
Jean:
What?

27:49.627 --> 27:51.755
The poor girl,
yeah, but Jesus.

27:51.796 --> 27:54.924
She crashed because
of her own incompetence.

27:54.966 --> 27:56.051
And now I'm going
to get burned.

27:56.092 --> 27:58.094
Well, bullshit.

27:58.136 --> 28:00.680
Oh, I... Sorry. Sorry.
It's, uh, instinct.

28:00.722 --> 28:01.723
I just...

28:01.765 --> 28:03.350
That wasn't even
a lie technically,

28:03.391 --> 28:05.643
so just never mind.
Sorry.

28:05.685 --> 28:07.062
No, what? Tell me.

28:07.103 --> 28:09.647
It's just when you said
that she crashed

28:09.689 --> 28:11.858
because of her own incompetence,
you didn't believe that,

28:11.900 --> 28:13.193
so I just...

28:13.234 --> 28:17.030
It's instinctual.
Cancer dog.
Sorry. Sorry.

28:17.072 --> 28:19.074
You're 100 percent right.

28:19.115 --> 28:20.575
I don't believe it.

28:20.617 --> 28:22.869
Something about all of this
doesn't sit right.

28:22.911 --> 28:24.329
Sit right how?

28:24.371 --> 28:26.039
Davis:
You record all
the practices, right?

28:26.081 --> 28:27.916
-You know it.
-Yesterday's too?

28:29.417 --> 28:31.086
Davis:
Look at the line she takes.

28:31.127 --> 28:32.379
What the hell is that?

28:32.420 --> 28:33.963
What? So,
so she made a mistake.

28:34.005 --> 28:36.007
She's too good of a driver
to make that mistake.

28:36.049 --> 28:37.592
-That turn.
-Way too deep.

28:37.634 --> 28:39.761
Way too hard,
straight into the wall.
It's almost like...

28:39.803 --> 28:41.221
-Randy: It's totally like.
-You think?

28:41.262 --> 28:42.597
-I do
-Charlie:
You want to cut me in

28:42.639 --> 28:44.224
on this grease-monkey
mind meld.

28:44.265 --> 28:45.392
Seems like there is...

28:45.433 --> 28:47.143
Both:
Something wrong
with the car.

28:47.185 --> 28:48.436
Don't they inspect it
or something?

28:48.478 --> 28:50.146
Night before practice,
went over it

28:50.188 --> 28:51.231
with a fine-toothed comb.

28:51.272 --> 28:53.066
My man can tooth
a race car.

28:53.108 --> 28:57.153
Okay, so maybe
something broke.

28:57.195 --> 28:58.947
Well, they towed it
back to my garage.

28:58.988 --> 29:00.824
Maybe it's worth
a look, right?

29:02.951 --> 29:04.327
What are we
looking for?

29:04.369 --> 29:05.662
Anything that looks funny.

29:19.175 --> 29:22.220
-What the hell?
-Randy: What's that?

29:22.262 --> 29:23.430
Does that look funny?

29:23.471 --> 29:24.931
Do you have a fishhook
in your engine?

29:24.973 --> 29:28.560
No, but I did have a family
of mice living there once, so...

29:28.601 --> 29:30.812
Well, they weren't supposed
to be there either.

29:30.854 --> 29:33.106
Somebody put that there.

29:33.148 --> 29:35.859
Okay. How could
a, a fishhook

29:35.900 --> 29:37.360
make a car crash?

29:37.402 --> 29:39.112
Well, if the car
was going full speed,

29:39.154 --> 29:41.114
which it appeared to be,

29:41.156 --> 29:44.284
carburetor would be
wide open.

29:44.325 --> 29:45.910
Oh shit.

29:45.952 --> 29:48.747
If the hook was attached
to a gear tie,

29:48.788 --> 29:50.498
it would catch.

29:50.540 --> 29:53.126
Randy:
Well, the tie could have
melted off, but damn.

29:53.168 --> 29:55.128
Even if you took
your foot off the gas,

29:55.170 --> 29:56.671
there ain't no way
to decelerate.

29:57.422 --> 29:58.298
Oh, my God.

29:58.340 --> 29:59.591
I don't get it.

29:59.632 --> 30:01.885
That's why Katy went
into turn one so hard.

30:01.926 --> 30:03.303
She couldn't slow down.

30:03.345 --> 30:04.554
Wow.

30:05.597 --> 30:07.474
That was supposed
to be for me.

30:07.515 --> 30:09.642
Somebody sabotaged
my car.

30:09.684 --> 30:10.685
Huh? What?

30:10.727 --> 30:13.313
No. No, no, no.
Come on. Come on.

30:13.355 --> 30:16.399
Man, that, that's insane, okay.
Who would do that?

30:20.028 --> 30:21.446
Uh, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

30:21.488 --> 30:24.032
He knew he couldn't beat me,
so he sabotaged my car.

30:24.074 --> 30:25.950
-Oh no.
-I have no doubt.

30:25.992 --> 30:26.910
Am I lying?

30:26.951 --> 30:28.244
No, you're not lying.

30:28.286 --> 30:29.829
But, you know,
just take a breath.

30:29.871 --> 30:31.831
You checked your car
the night before,

30:31.873 --> 30:34.751
and you were with it
the whole time at the track.

30:34.793 --> 30:35.877
-So...
-Truth.

30:35.919 --> 30:37.087
We would have seen
someone messing with it.

30:37.128 --> 30:38.380
Charlie:
Yeah.

30:38.421 --> 30:40.548
A tow call came in
last night before practice,

30:40.590 --> 30:42.175
but it ended up
being a prank.

30:42.217 --> 30:43.968
I bet it was Owens
who made the call

30:44.010 --> 30:47.013
to get me out of the house
so he can sabotage my car.

30:47.055 --> 30:48.973
That conniving little bitch.

30:49.015 --> 30:50.392
He fucking tried to kill me!

30:50.433 --> 30:52.686
I'm going to put Keith Owens
in a fucking wheelchair.

30:52.727 --> 30:54.020
-Randall.
-Let's roll, baby.

30:54.062 --> 30:55.355
Okay.
Nobody's rolling.

30:55.397 --> 30:56.815
Nobody's putting anybody
in a wheelchair.

30:56.856 --> 30:59.150
-Try and stop me.
-Charlie: Listen to me.

30:59.192 --> 31:01.528
You can't go after
Keith right now.

31:01.569 --> 31:03.738
The man's daughter
is in a coma.

31:03.780 --> 31:06.991
Alright?
Remember last night's
candlelight prayer vigil.

31:07.033 --> 31:08.910
And there's going to be
another one tomorrow for Keith.

31:08.952 --> 31:09.994
Get the candles ready.

31:10.036 --> 31:11.454
Charlie: No, guys,
stop being stupid.

31:11.496 --> 31:12.622
Alright? Really?

31:14.416 --> 31:15.834
I'll go talk to him.

31:17.002 --> 31:18.545
You can cancer dog him.

31:18.586 --> 31:21.131
Well, I'm regretting
settling on that metaphor,

31:21.172 --> 31:23.717
but, yes,
I can cancer dog him.

31:23.758 --> 31:26.720
Uh, if he's lying,
I'll know it.

31:26.761 --> 31:29.806
Then you two can go full
"Deliverance" on him. Okay?

31:32.308 --> 31:34.686
Nothing, huh?
Great movie.

31:40.567 --> 31:41.693
Charlie:
Hi.

31:43.111 --> 31:44.362
Yes.

31:44.404 --> 31:46.406
Oh, uh, I'm, uh,

31:46.448 --> 31:48.033
I'm Charlie Cale.

31:48.074 --> 31:49.451
I, uh...

31:49.492 --> 31:51.995
I work at the, uh,
the go-kart track.

31:52.037 --> 31:53.079
Okay.

31:55.623 --> 31:59.085
Uh, Jean wanted me
to bring these by.

31:59.127 --> 32:01.713
She said, uh,
she just wants you to know

32:01.755 --> 32:04.132
that she's thinking
about you and your family.

32:05.091 --> 32:06.134
Okay.

32:07.385 --> 32:08.720
Tell her I said thanks.

32:08.762 --> 32:09.637
Charlie:
Yeah.

32:09.679 --> 32:11.097
You can leave 'em
out front.

32:11.973 --> 32:12.932
Oh.

32:15.060 --> 32:16.895
You know,
I haven't been here long,

32:16.936 --> 32:20.190
but I, I know that
Katy's a great driver.

32:20.231 --> 32:24.736
I know it's just go-karts,
but I saw her myself and, uh,

32:24.778 --> 32:26.154
she is special.

32:27.280 --> 32:29.324
She has the gift.

32:29.366 --> 32:31.076
Like her grandfather.

32:31.117 --> 32:32.160
My father.

32:37.665 --> 32:38.958
I never had it.

32:42.921 --> 32:46.132
Oh, uh, are you
a big fishing guy?

32:49.094 --> 32:51.304
Like I said, you can
leave those out front.

32:52.472 --> 32:54.683
I only ask because, uh,

32:54.724 --> 32:56.476
so when Davis got
his car back,

32:56.518 --> 32:58.436
he said that there was a,

32:58.478 --> 33:01.731
like a fishhook
in the engine, uh.

33:02.649 --> 33:04.943
That's a funny thing, right?
I, I...

33:04.984 --> 33:07.612
Anyway,
hot-headed kid that he is.

33:07.654 --> 33:09.823
So he was saying
he thinks that

33:09.864 --> 33:11.658
maybe somebody
put it there,

33:11.700 --> 33:14.285
like tampered
with the engine.

33:14.327 --> 33:16.121
I mean,
that's crazy, right?

33:18.873 --> 33:21.459
I don't know who
the hell you are

33:21.501 --> 33:23.503
or what this is about,

33:23.545 --> 33:25.922
but I didn't touch
that kid's car.

33:28.842 --> 33:30.218
So are we done?

33:33.638 --> 33:35.265
I'll put those out front.

33:41.312 --> 33:42.689
Oh, uh...

33:44.649 --> 33:47.277
I'm, uh, so sorry.

33:54.743 --> 33:56.286
What was that?

33:57.495 --> 33:58.663
Nothin'.

33:58.705 --> 34:00.373
Bullshit.

34:04.336 --> 34:05.378
Hey, guys.

34:06.546 --> 34:07.464
Davis:
What happened?

34:07.505 --> 34:09.132
So, uh,
you were right.

34:09.174 --> 34:10.759
-He did it.
-I fucking knew it.

34:10.800 --> 34:11.926
Thank you. Thank you.

34:11.968 --> 34:14.012
-Shit. What happened?
-Keith did it.

34:14.054 --> 34:15.430
-No shit.
-Charlie: Mm-hmm.

34:15.472 --> 34:17.140
-Yeah. That's really illegal.
-Charlie: Yeah.

34:17.182 --> 34:20.060
So, uh, look, we know
he did it, right,

34:20.101 --> 34:22.062
but, uh, if you really
want to nail Keith,

34:22.103 --> 34:23.855
we're gonna need
hard evidence, cop evidence.

34:23.897 --> 34:26.024
We need, like,
a CSI for cars.

34:26.066 --> 34:28.526
First thing we need to do
is take that fishhook,
put it in a Ziploc.

34:28.568 --> 34:31.029
Yeah, we check the garage
for prints, tracks, traces--

34:31.071 --> 34:32.697
My Uncle Raymond's
got a black light.

34:32.739 --> 34:35.325
That ain't what he uses it for,
but it should work.

34:35.367 --> 34:38.411
Well, this is about
to get comedic, isn't it?

34:38.453 --> 34:40.080
Hey. Hey. No running.

34:41.456 --> 34:42.582
No running!

34:42.624 --> 34:44.709
What the hell?

34:44.751 --> 34:46.336
Keith: (on TV)
The night before practice

34:46.378 --> 34:49.047
-at Peachtree Speedway...
-Excuse me.

34:49.089 --> 34:51.841
Keith: ...I snuck into
Davis McDowell's garage,

34:51.883 --> 34:54.010
and I tampered
with his race car.

34:55.553 --> 34:56.763
Yes.

34:57.639 --> 35:00.850
I wanted Davis
to crash, but...

35:00.892 --> 35:03.186
I never meant
for anyone to get hurt.

35:04.437 --> 35:05.939
Especially not Katy.

35:06.940 --> 35:08.983
That it was Katy

35:09.025 --> 35:11.111
behind the wheel
of that car

35:11.152 --> 35:13.822
was a horrible
twist of fate.

35:13.863 --> 35:16.074
And something that
I will have to live with

35:16.991 --> 35:19.077
for the rest of my days.

35:19.119 --> 35:20.912
-Thank you.
-(reporters clamoring)

35:20.954 --> 35:22.872
(phone ringing)

35:24.457 --> 35:25.458
I have to take this.

35:25.500 --> 35:26.543
Reporter:
A shattering confession

35:26.584 --> 35:27.585
from Keith Owens,

35:27.627 --> 35:28.920
who, according to authorities,

35:28.962 --> 35:31.089
sabotaged a competitor's car

35:31.131 --> 35:32.924
with a fishing hook
and gear tie.

35:32.966 --> 35:34.968
Well, I guess
that's that.

35:35.802 --> 35:36.845
Man.

35:36.886 --> 35:39.806
Karma's like some
kind of consequence.

35:40.807 --> 35:42.642
I agree.

35:42.684 --> 35:45.562
Karma is like
a consequence.

35:45.603 --> 35:48.356
Yes, sir.
Yes, I'll be there in 20.

35:50.275 --> 35:51.317
Thank you, sir.

35:52.902 --> 35:54.821
Cops. They need
to see the car.

35:54.863 --> 35:57.615
Lots of stuff.
CSI car stuff, I guess.

35:57.657 --> 35:59.743
Yeah, well, shit, huh?

35:59.784 --> 36:02.037
I can't believe it.
Keith did it.

36:02.078 --> 36:03.371
And now he's never
going to race again,

36:03.413 --> 36:07.042
which means I fuckin' won
the championship.

36:07.083 --> 36:09.336
That means
his sponsors and...

36:09.377 --> 36:11.129
My mom won't have
to work anymore.

36:11.171 --> 36:13.840
Hey, I know this is
a complicated situation,

36:13.882 --> 36:15.925
but congratulations.

36:15.967 --> 36:17.135
You didn't do
anything wrong,

36:17.177 --> 36:18.803
and it's alright
for a part of you

36:18.845 --> 36:20.764
to feel good right now.

36:20.805 --> 36:22.474
(phone chimes)

36:23.850 --> 36:25.143
-Sorry.
-Yeah, no.

36:25.185 --> 36:27.270
Do your thing.
I'll catch you later. Alright?

36:27.312 --> 36:28.438
Congratulations.

36:33.360 --> 36:34.944
Hey, Curt.

36:34.986 --> 36:36.738
What happened?
You okay?

36:36.780 --> 36:39.657
-I'm scared to race.
-What? Why?

36:39.699 --> 36:41.659
Seatbelts don't work.

36:41.701 --> 36:43.661
Your seatbelt's fine, buddy.

36:43.703 --> 36:45.789
Curt:
Katy's seatbelt didn't work.

36:45.830 --> 36:47.499
That's why she's
in the hospital.

36:47.540 --> 36:49.000
Davis:
No, hey, listen to me.

36:49.042 --> 36:50.418
Your seatbelt is safe.

36:50.460 --> 36:52.921
Randy makes sure of that.
He checks it all the time.

36:52.962 --> 36:54.673
Hey, look at me.

36:54.714 --> 36:56.466
What happened
to Katy was a fluke.

36:56.508 --> 36:59.636
Her seatbelt malfunction
was a freak accident.

37:00.387 --> 37:01.554
Bullshit.

37:11.231 --> 37:12.607
Hey, uh, Randy.

37:12.649 --> 37:16.903
So what happened
to Katy's seatbelt again?

37:16.945 --> 37:18.571
I mean,
why'd it break?

37:18.613 --> 37:21.157
Uh, it was old probably.
Just wear and tear.

37:21.199 --> 37:22.617
Huh.

37:22.659 --> 37:27.122
And do they get checked
or inspected before each race?

37:27.163 --> 37:28.289
Randy:
Uh, no, ma'am.

37:28.331 --> 37:30.333
Seatbelt's not like
a chassis adjustment

37:30.375 --> 37:31.459
or, or tire pressure,

37:31.501 --> 37:33.837
something you can
adjust on the fly.

37:33.878 --> 37:37.757
Belts are complicated
as hell. Even these.

37:37.799 --> 37:40.510
Any time I gotta fix one,
kart goes to the garage.

37:40.552 --> 37:41.428
Oh.

37:41.469 --> 37:43.263
Same thing
as a late model car.

37:43.304 --> 37:44.514
Huh.

37:45.557 --> 37:48.852
Oh, hey, Jean,
uh, you seen Davis?

37:52.230 --> 37:53.982
You alright?

37:54.024 --> 37:55.817
He broke into
my garage.

37:56.651 --> 37:58.528
The cold-bloodedness
of that.

37:58.570 --> 38:01.573
Gee, I... I didn't
think about that.

38:01.614 --> 38:03.324
You were there
when that happened.

38:03.366 --> 38:05.160
That's intense.
I'm sorry.

38:05.201 --> 38:07.662
I, I wasn't home.

38:07.704 --> 38:10.665
-What?
-Oh, I was out on a tow call.

38:10.707 --> 38:12.542
-With Davis?
-Oh God, no.

38:12.584 --> 38:14.961
After what he did,
I sent that boy to bed.

38:15.003 --> 38:17.464
I can't sit here
all night.

38:17.505 --> 38:19.674
I got to go restock
the fidget spinners.

38:19.716 --> 38:20.759
Okay.

38:30.310 --> 38:31.895
(keys jingling)

38:40.487 --> 38:41.738
Ah, shit.

38:43.073 --> 38:45.700
They took it
to the CSI car lab.

38:45.742 --> 38:46.659
Shit. Shit.

38:48.078 --> 38:50.080
(heavy sigh)
Okay.

38:51.414 --> 38:52.749
What am I looking for?

38:56.336 --> 38:58.880
Well, seatbelt tools,

38:58.922 --> 39:01.091
seatbelt fragments,
I don't know.

39:02.509 --> 39:05.095
Great.
Things I don't know
what they look like.

39:05.136 --> 39:06.429
What the fuck
am I doing?

39:06.471 --> 39:07.931
Oh, geez.

39:09.265 --> 39:10.433
Oh.

39:12.268 --> 39:15.063
Hey, Big Ed.
You got any advice for me?

39:16.690 --> 39:18.942
-(door opens)
-Huh?

39:20.694 --> 39:21.695
Oh shit.

39:27.075 --> 39:29.411
Alright...

39:29.452 --> 39:32.122
They're in here, Mom.
You left them in the garage!

40:01.985 --> 40:03.153
Davis: Hey.

40:04.446 --> 40:06.281
What are you doing here?

40:06.322 --> 40:07.949
Did you mess
with Katy's seatbelt?

40:08.533 --> 40:09.951
Did I what?

40:09.993 --> 40:11.161
Well, geez.

40:11.202 --> 40:13.496
Look--

40:13.538 --> 40:17.208
Well, you told Curt
that Katy's seatbelt failing

40:17.250 --> 40:18.460
was a freak accident,

40:18.501 --> 40:21.004
but that was a lie.

40:21.796 --> 40:23.173
What are you talkin' about?

40:24.257 --> 40:26.843
Also, uh,
I realized that,

40:26.885 --> 40:29.512
well, when you showed
me and Randy the engine,

40:29.554 --> 40:31.139
there was a fishhook
in it, and,

40:31.181 --> 40:34.559
and you said that if it was
attached to a gear tie,

40:34.601 --> 40:36.853
it would keep
the carburetor open.

40:38.355 --> 40:40.940
Yeah. And that's what
Keith did.

40:40.982 --> 40:43.360
Right. But couldn't it
have been

40:43.401 --> 40:47.739
a piece of wire
or dental floss.

40:47.781 --> 40:51.034
Hell, why not
a fishing line?

40:51.076 --> 40:52.535
He could have used
fishing line, right?

40:52.577 --> 40:53.703
I mean, it could
have been anything.

40:53.745 --> 40:57.040
But you said gear tie.

40:57.082 --> 40:59.209
And, and then
when Keith confessed,

40:59.250 --> 41:01.670
what do you know, I...

41:01.711 --> 41:03.630
that's exactly
what he used.

41:04.964 --> 41:05.840
So?

41:05.882 --> 41:07.050
So...

41:08.218 --> 41:10.804
you knew it was there.

41:10.845 --> 41:13.473
Because you saw
Keith do it.

41:13.515 --> 41:15.517
You were home
when he did it.

41:15.558 --> 41:18.311
And then you messed
with the seatbelts,

41:18.353 --> 41:19.562
with the seatbelt wrenches.

41:19.604 --> 41:22.732
Do you even...
What's a seatbelt wrench?

41:22.774 --> 41:24.192
Tell me anything I said
isn't true.

41:24.234 --> 41:25.318
Go on, say it out loud.

41:25.360 --> 41:26.820
Keith confessed!

41:27.862 --> 41:29.155
It's over.

41:30.490 --> 41:33.618
You tried to kill
a person, you psycho.

41:34.577 --> 41:36.121
And for what?

41:36.162 --> 41:40.625
You know, driving
a car around in a circle.

41:41.209 --> 41:42.502
Really?

41:42.544 --> 41:44.045
It's over, Charlie.

41:45.505 --> 41:47.549
And, yeah...

41:47.590 --> 41:50.135
I'd kill someone
for what I get on that track.

41:51.428 --> 41:52.804
And so would Keith.

41:55.557 --> 41:57.600
I guess you really
don't understand that.

41:58.101 --> 41:59.602
(thud)

42:04.232 --> 42:05.233
Jean:
Davis?

42:08.611 --> 42:10.530
Honey, you've got
my keys?

42:10.572 --> 42:12.907
-Oh. Hey, Charlie.
-Charlie: Hey, Jean.

42:12.949 --> 42:14.492
You wanna stay
for dinner?

42:14.534 --> 42:15.535
You know what?

42:15.577 --> 42:17.078
I really, I'd love to,

42:17.120 --> 42:18.371
but I got to go.

42:24.419 --> 42:25.628
Alright.

42:33.470 --> 42:34.763
Jesus.

42:50.236 --> 42:51.946
(engine revving)

42:52.614 --> 42:53.990
Oh shit.

42:57.535 --> 42:58.995
Goddammit.

43:04.542 --> 43:07.003
Alright, trust the car.

43:07.045 --> 43:09.923
-Trust the car,
trust the car, Charlie.
-(engine revving)

43:09.964 --> 43:11.800
I'm gonna trust you,
you piece of shit.

43:11.841 --> 43:14.094
(tires screeching)

43:17.013 --> 43:18.306
Fuck!

43:19.599 --> 43:21.476
Ahhhh!

43:21.518 --> 43:24.104
(tires squealing)

43:30.610 --> 43:31.861
(exhales)

43:34.197 --> 43:35.365
Alright, baby.

43:44.040 --> 43:47.752
Announcer: And introducing
Lucas Oil's new ambassador

43:47.794 --> 43:49.754
Davis McDowell.

43:49.796 --> 43:50.964
(crowd cheering)

43:51.006 --> 43:53.925
I want to thank
my new sponsor, Lucas Oil,

43:53.967 --> 43:57.012
and dedicate today's race
to Katy Owens.

43:57.053 --> 43:58.471
I hope she gets better soon.

43:58.513 --> 44:01.307
-(crowd cheering)
-Thank you. Congratulations.

44:09.024 --> 44:10.483
You did it!

44:10.525 --> 44:12.527
It's everything
you always wanted.

44:13.319 --> 44:15.155
Thanks, Mom.

44:20.660 --> 44:21.745
(thumping)

44:22.829 --> 44:24.289
Jesus.

44:24.330 --> 44:25.790
What the hell
are you doing here?
You can't be here.

44:25.832 --> 44:29.502
Yeah, I know. But as I was,
uh, leaving town last night,

44:29.544 --> 44:32.380
well, I remembered that I,
I had something of yours.

44:33.715 --> 44:35.842
You see, uh,
when I saw

44:35.884 --> 44:37.969
Big Ed's smiling face
on the workbench,

44:38.011 --> 44:40.305
well, I knew you never
had any intention

44:40.347 --> 44:42.640
of gettin'
in your car that day.

44:42.682 --> 44:44.309
Big Ed wasn't
on the dash

44:44.351 --> 44:46.144
because you knew your car
was going to crash

44:46.186 --> 44:48.772
and you didn't want
the photo to get damaged.

44:48.813 --> 44:50.982
Well, that's some evil shit.

44:51.024 --> 44:53.485
You, my friend,
are a fuckin' monster.

44:53.526 --> 44:56.237
You should leave.
It's not safe for you here.

44:57.322 --> 44:59.324
Yeah, I realized that
last night.

44:59.991 --> 45:02.160
So today, I, uh,

45:02.202 --> 45:05.497
well, I quit the track,
I said goodbye to Jean,

45:05.538 --> 45:07.123
and then I, uh,

45:07.165 --> 45:08.958
I stopped by the hospital.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.753
I had a, a good talk
with Donna.

45:11.795 --> 45:16.257
So she was telling me all this
interesting stuff about Keith,

45:17.050 --> 45:18.677
about his flow,

45:18.718 --> 45:21.554
about what happens when you,
uh, when you lose it.

45:22.222 --> 45:23.264
Look at old Keith.

45:23.306 --> 45:25.016
So he stepped up
in the end,

45:25.058 --> 45:27.185
did the right thing,
confessed.

45:27.227 --> 45:29.020
Yeah, he's just the man
she knew he was.

45:29.062 --> 45:31.064
Gee. That's really nice.

45:31.731 --> 45:32.857
Yeah.

45:32.899 --> 45:35.235
Oh, and then I had a,

45:35.276 --> 45:37.278
a good talk with Katy.

45:38.697 --> 45:39.614
Oh yeah.

45:39.656 --> 45:41.032
She's totally lucid.

45:41.074 --> 45:44.494
Sort of a miracle thing.

45:44.536 --> 45:47.372
That doctor's saying she's
gonna bounce back fast.

45:48.623 --> 45:49.708
I tell you,

45:49.749 --> 45:52.168
the way this girl
talks about racing,

45:52.210 --> 45:54.170
I finally got it.

45:55.088 --> 45:57.215
A month, a year.

45:57.257 --> 45:59.175
I don't know what
it's going to take,

45:59.217 --> 46:01.720
but she'll be racing
again soon.

46:01.761 --> 46:03.388
And she's comin' for you.

46:03.430 --> 46:05.265
It's just a matter of time.

46:06.975 --> 46:08.977
Ain't no one better
than Davis McDowell.

46:09.019 --> 46:10.770
I'm the future
of the goddamn sport.

46:10.812 --> 46:12.230
Okay?

46:12.272 --> 46:15.233
Well, we both know
that's bullshit.

46:17.610 --> 46:18.737
Buckle up, kid.

46:21.990 --> 46:25.243

46:30.331 --> 46:33.460
Announcer:
Drivers, start your engines!

46:34.210 --> 46:35.712
(engine revving)

46:38.214 --> 46:41.801

46:49.809 --> 46:52.354
* Drivin' on 9 *

46:53.563 --> 46:56.441

47:29.349 --> 47:32.227

47:33.353 --> 47:37.565
