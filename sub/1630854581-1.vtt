WEBVTT

00:18.152 --> 00:19.620
- It's every kid's dream.

00:19.687 --> 00:21.822
A snowstorm hits a town
so hard

00:21.889 --> 00:24.758
that all the roads
are completely undriveable.

00:24.825 --> 00:27.361
- All right, hold on,
Mr. Narrator Guy.

00:27.428 --> 00:28.496
I'll take it from here.

00:28.562 --> 00:30.531
- Uh, okay.

00:30.598 --> 00:33.033
- As he was saying,
sometimes a snowstorm

00:33.101 --> 00:37.138
is so big that school is
canceled for the whole day.

00:37.205 --> 00:39.340
It's a surprise vacation,

00:39.407 --> 00:41.675
a "get out of class free"
card,

00:41.742 --> 00:45.846
a magical, fun day
where anything can happen.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.616
A snow day.

00:48.682 --> 00:50.551
- And now let's turn it over
to Deborah May

00:50.618 --> 00:52.520
for traffic
and weather together.

00:52.586 --> 00:54.288
- Hello, Syracuse!

00:54.355 --> 00:55.656
Our top story today

00:55.723 --> 00:57.725
is that mountain
of snow outside your door.

00:57.791 --> 01:00.094
- You see that darling,
wide-eyed girl?

01:00.161 --> 01:03.297
That's me, Natalie Brandston,
one year ago.

01:03.364 --> 01:05.366
Boy, was I cute!

01:05.432 --> 01:07.101
And next to me

01:07.168 --> 01:10.037
is my charmingly
awkward brother, Hal.

01:10.104 --> 01:11.905
- Undriveable.

01:11.972 --> 01:14.942
I mean, I was lucky to get
out of my garage before it--

01:15.008 --> 01:17.345
- But back to me.
Why do I look nervous?

01:17.411 --> 01:20.381
Because I had a big, old
English paper due that day,

01:20.448 --> 01:22.650
and I hadn't even started.

01:22.716 --> 01:25.953
- I am just getting word
that due to road closures,

01:26.019 --> 01:28.055
all Syracuse schools
will be closed...

01:29.657 --> 01:31.425
Making today

01:31.492 --> 01:32.860
a snow day!

01:32.926 --> 01:33.961
- A snow day?

01:34.027 --> 01:35.763
- It's a snow day!

01:35.829 --> 01:37.198
- Snow day!
- Snow day!

01:37.265 --> 01:39.700
- * It's a snow day,
snow day! *

01:39.767 --> 01:42.470
* Woo-hoo, let's do it
our way, our way *

01:42.536 --> 01:43.837
* Woo-hoo *

01:43.904 --> 01:45.239
* Everything
we're living for *

01:45.306 --> 01:46.874
* Anything
you're dreaming for *

01:46.940 --> 01:49.477
* The world is
knocking at my door *

01:49.543 --> 01:51.512
* It's a snow day *

01:51.579 --> 01:52.780
- * Just what
I've been waiting for *

01:52.846 --> 01:54.448
[giggling]
- Hey, guys.

01:54.515 --> 01:56.750
It's a snow day!
Woo!

01:56.817 --> 02:00.288
- * It might be cold,
but we don't feel it *

02:00.354 --> 02:02.390
* *

02:02.456 --> 02:03.991
* Get up, let's go *

02:04.057 --> 02:06.760
* A little freedom's
all we needed *

02:06.827 --> 02:08.262
* *

02:08.329 --> 02:10.598
- * One big ray of sunshine *

02:10.663 --> 02:15.068
* Backed up
in four little words *

02:15.135 --> 02:19.173
- * The greatest sound
we ever heard *

02:19.240 --> 02:20.308
- This just in...

02:20.374 --> 02:22.543
- * It's a snow day, snow day *

02:22.610 --> 02:25.513
* Woo-hoo
let's do it our way, our way *

02:25.579 --> 02:26.847
* Woo-hoo *

02:26.914 --> 02:28.482
* Everything we're living for *

02:28.549 --> 02:29.783
* Anything
you're dreaming for *

02:29.850 --> 02:32.520
* The world is
knocking at my door *

02:32.586 --> 02:34.655
* It's a snow day *

02:34.722 --> 02:36.156
- * Just what
I've been waiting for *

02:36.224 --> 02:37.691
kids: No books, no rules!

02:37.758 --> 02:39.091
- * Only good vibes *

02:39.159 --> 02:41.161
- No stress, no school!

02:41.228 --> 02:42.230
- * Only good times *

02:42.296 --> 02:44.164
- No books, no rules!

02:44.232 --> 02:46.867
- * Only good vibes,
only good times *

02:46.934 --> 02:48.101
- Here we go!

02:48.168 --> 02:50.170
- * It's a snow day,
snow day *

02:50.238 --> 02:53.207
* Woo-hoo
let's do it our way, our way *

02:53.274 --> 02:54.608
* Woo-hoo *

02:54.675 --> 02:55.843
* Everything we're living for *

02:55.909 --> 02:57.511
* Anything we're dreaming for *

02:57.578 --> 03:00.414
* The world is
knocking at my door *

03:00.481 --> 03:02.182
* It's a snow day *

03:02.250 --> 03:03.684
* Just what
I've been waiting for *

03:03.751 --> 03:05.686
* Woo-hoo *

03:05.753 --> 03:07.221
* It's a snow day *

03:07.288 --> 03:08.589
* Woo-hoo *

03:08.656 --> 03:09.857
* It's a snow day *

03:09.923 --> 03:11.492
* Everything we're living for *

03:11.559 --> 03:12.926
* Anything we're dreaming for *

03:12.993 --> 03:15.563
* The world is
knocking at my door *

03:15.629 --> 03:17.465
* It's a snow day *

03:17.531 --> 03:19.600
* Just what
I've been waiting for *

03:19.667 --> 03:21.269
* *

03:21.335 --> 03:23.603
* It's a snow day *

03:23.671 --> 03:27.140
* Oh, it's a snow day *

03:27.207 --> 03:28.376
* Woo-hoo *

03:28.442 --> 03:31.745
* *

03:31.812 --> 03:33.747
- Well, Syracuse,
the unseasonably

03:33.814 --> 03:35.349
warm winter weather
continues today

03:35.416 --> 03:37.385
with a high of 65 degrees.

03:37.451 --> 03:39.987
- Well, here I am one year
later, still cute,

03:40.053 --> 03:42.555
but unfortunately, no snow.

03:42.623 --> 03:44.024
- Here's a fun fact.

03:44.091 --> 03:45.826
On this exact date last year,

03:45.893 --> 03:47.828
Syracuse had a snow day.

03:47.895 --> 03:50.798
- There's nothing fun
about that fact, Deborah.

03:50.864 --> 03:53.033
Hal, you got to help me.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.502
Winter break is in
three days,

03:54.567 --> 03:56.804
and I need to get
out of school until then.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.506
- How come?
- To get out of all the tests

03:58.572 --> 04:00.040
I refuse to study for!

04:00.107 --> 04:03.477
Right now, I have
a perfect 70% average.

04:03.544 --> 04:05.178
Any dips and it's--
- Winter school?

04:05.245 --> 04:06.947
- Winter school.
- Oh, no.

04:07.014 --> 04:08.148
- Oh, yes.

04:08.215 --> 04:09.683
Summer school's
even more evil twin.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.352
When you leave at
the end of the day,

04:11.419 --> 04:12.920
it's dark and depressing.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.388
And while all
the other kids

04:14.455 --> 04:16.255
are playing with the things
they got for Christmas,

04:16.324 --> 04:18.358
you've got homework.

04:18.426 --> 04:20.260
[suspenseful music]

04:20.327 --> 04:22.029
- Okay, Mom's putting
on her second shoe,

04:22.095 --> 04:23.664
so we don't have a lot of time.

04:23.731 --> 04:24.932
- You and your
freakish hearing.

04:24.998 --> 04:26.367
- Yeah, that's my superpower.

04:26.434 --> 04:27.635
- It's not a superpower.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.102
Nobody would go see
the movie "Ear Man."

04:29.169 --> 04:31.038
- Okay, if you don't
want my help--

04:31.104 --> 04:33.607
- No, the world needs
Ear Man now, more than ever.

04:33.674 --> 04:35.909
- Okay, okay, uh...
have a stuffed doze.

04:35.976 --> 04:38.145
- Doze?
- Doze, like nose.

04:38.211 --> 04:39.713
And instead of
saying the letter M,

04:39.780 --> 04:41.315
say the letter B.

04:41.382 --> 04:44.652
It'll bake it sound like your
doze is clogged with bucus.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.787
- You're good.
Why don't you ever fake sick?

04:46.854 --> 04:48.556
- Oh, no, I'm just
the ideas guy.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.924
I don't do so hot
with the actual doing.

04:50.991 --> 04:53.361
- He's got above average
hearing and good ideas,

04:53.427 --> 04:54.928
but no follow-through.

04:54.995 --> 04:59.332
Coming this spring, Ear Man,
the anti-action hero.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.201
- I'd see it.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.805
Showtime.
- Okay.

05:04.872 --> 05:06.374
- Time for school, guys.

05:06.440 --> 05:09.343
- Bob, is that you?

05:09.410 --> 05:11.211
- Who's Bob?

05:11.278 --> 05:14.648
- Sorry, it's my nose,
totally clogged with bucus,

05:14.715 --> 05:16.617
which I'm sure you can hear.

05:16.684 --> 05:18.218
- Sounds pretty bad, huh?

05:18.285 --> 05:19.953
- Actually, it sounds like
somebody's trying to

05:20.020 --> 05:21.789
get out of all of her tests
the next three days

05:21.855 --> 05:24.124
so she doesn't have to
go to winter school.

05:26.226 --> 05:30.297
Ear Man gets his above average
hearing from Ear Mom.

05:30.364 --> 05:33.066
Now, that's a movie I'd see.

05:33.133 --> 05:34.234
- Phew.

05:34.301 --> 05:35.469
You'll figure
something else out.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.471
- Good morning, family.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.172
- Hey, Dad.
- Morning, Dad.

05:39.239 --> 05:41.542
- I am Cop-o-dile,

05:41.609 --> 05:46.213
half cop, half croc,
all business.

05:46.279 --> 05:47.581
[whispers] Okay,
go steal something,

05:47.648 --> 05:49.483
and then I'll bite you
in the name of justice.

05:49.550 --> 05:52.252
- Sorry, Randy, I don't have
time to play with you today.

05:52.319 --> 05:53.954
- Why not?

05:54.021 --> 05:57.791
- Because like the
mighty croc, I'm swamped.

05:59.058 --> 06:00.227
- [sighs]

06:00.293 --> 06:02.129
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, Randy.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.565
Did you know that the crocodile
releases heat

06:04.632 --> 06:07.568
through his mouth because
he doesn't have sweat glands?

06:07.635 --> 06:09.703
- Ugh.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.405
- It's a fun fact.

06:11.472 --> 06:14.442
- Do no adults understand
the meaning of fun fact?

06:14.508 --> 06:17.310
[phone buzzes]
- Oh, yes!

06:17.377 --> 06:19.613
The spotlight operator for the
winter dance recital is sick.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.348
- With what?
Something contagious?

06:21.415 --> 06:22.816
I will lick him.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.952
- It means I get to run
the spotlight after school.

06:25.018 --> 06:27.721
- Why are you so excited
about running the spotlight?

06:27.788 --> 06:30.290
- What?

06:30.357 --> 06:31.692
No reason.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.894
No, I--I just love
the craft...

06:33.961 --> 06:37.264
of light...spotting.

06:43.370 --> 06:45.172
- It's a girl.

06:45.238 --> 06:48.408
["Dance of the Sugar
Plum Fairy"]

06:48.476 --> 06:55.415
* *

07:07.294 --> 07:08.496
- Oh!

07:08.562 --> 07:10.097
[laughing] Lane.

07:10.163 --> 07:12.299
Oh, I seriously think you just
shaved a year off of my life.

07:12.365 --> 07:13.834
- It wasn't going
to be a great year.

07:13.901 --> 07:15.235
I checked.
- Ha ha.

07:15.302 --> 07:16.269
- Here.

07:16.336 --> 07:18.138
- Oh, thank you.

07:18.205 --> 07:21.441
* *

07:21.509 --> 07:22.910
[squealing]

07:22.976 --> 07:25.145
- That was lovely, Claire.
All right.

07:25.212 --> 07:27.414
My dancers on stage
can take a break.

07:27.481 --> 07:29.149
We're moving on to
the nondenominational

07:29.216 --> 07:30.417
winter dance.

07:30.484 --> 07:33.220
- Don't you get bored
all alone up here?

07:33.286 --> 07:34.287
- No way.

07:34.354 --> 07:36.256
No, this is like
my perfect job.

07:36.323 --> 07:37.525
I get to shine
a light on the stage,

07:37.591 --> 07:39.126
but stay in the shadows.

07:39.192 --> 07:41.261
I control the spotlight,
but I'm out of it.

07:41.328 --> 07:42.596
- How poetic.

07:42.663 --> 07:44.532
- Plus, I can stare at
Claire all rehearsal,

07:44.598 --> 07:45.666
and it's not weird.

07:45.733 --> 07:46.734
- How pathetic.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.135
- Mittens, can you come--

07:48.201 --> 07:50.270
no, left.
You're on the left.

07:50.337 --> 07:51.104
No, you're on the--

07:51.171 --> 07:52.606
all right, all right!

07:52.673 --> 07:55.576
You're mittens, not gloves!

07:55.643 --> 07:57.077
I need a five.

07:57.745 --> 07:58.912
- [chuckles]

07:58.979 --> 08:01.782
[indistinct chatter]

08:03.884 --> 08:07.955
- Well, as riveting as it is to
watch you watch Claire Bonner,

08:08.021 --> 08:10.624
I think I saw some
paint drying outside.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.325
So got to get to that.

08:12.392 --> 08:13.694
- Hey, you want
to grab some food

08:13.761 --> 08:14.862
when I'm out of rehearsal?

08:14.928 --> 08:17.698
- I do, but first...
[snaps] shoes.

08:17.765 --> 08:19.032
Lift.

08:19.099 --> 08:21.368
Who am I?
- You're my hero.

08:21.434 --> 08:23.236
- You know, I don't like
you being up so high,

08:23.303 --> 08:26.306
considering you're, shall
we say, less than graceful.

08:26.373 --> 08:28.576
I mean, you do tend
to fall a lot when--

08:28.642 --> 08:29.577
- Shh, shh, Claire's talking.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.779
- [gasp] She is?

08:31.845 --> 08:33.480
Hold on.

08:33.547 --> 08:35.549
Hi, TMZ?
Hot goss.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.717
Claire Bonner is talking.

08:37.784 --> 08:39.052
No, I'm 100%--

08:39.119 --> 08:41.054
- Okay, okay, go watch
your paint dry.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.722
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[giggles]

08:42.789 --> 08:45.025
- And that is why turtlenecks
will never go out of fashion.

08:45.092 --> 08:46.493
- She makes
a compelling argument.

08:46.560 --> 08:49.462
- Yeah, but all I think
about is the poor turtle

08:49.529 --> 08:50.931
who had to die to make it.

08:50.998 --> 08:52.099
- No, Missy.
- Missy, you don't seriously--

08:52.165 --> 08:53.701
- No, okay, but,
like, do you think

08:53.767 --> 08:58.305
a turtleneck would hide
or accentuate, you know...

08:58.371 --> 08:59.640
my short neck?

08:59.707 --> 09:01.108
[gasp] Oh, my gosh!

09:01.174 --> 09:02.743
- What?
- My whale necklace is gone.

09:02.810 --> 09:04.878
- Okay, well, where's the last
place you remember wearing it?

09:04.945 --> 09:06.546
- Oh, probably around her neck.

09:06.614 --> 09:08.649
- Missy, I worry about you.
- No, Missy.

09:08.716 --> 09:10.851
- Okay, I'm back
and I am calm now.

09:10.918 --> 09:12.519
So let's take
this from the top.

09:12.586 --> 09:14.755
- I haven't taken that necklace
off since my dad got it for me

09:14.822 --> 09:16.590
in Barcelona five years ago.

09:16.657 --> 09:19.026
- Wow, this is like as bad
as it gets for incredibly

09:19.092 --> 09:20.493
beautiful teenage girls.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.029
- Yeah!

09:22.095 --> 09:25.332
Plus it distracts from,
you know...

09:25.398 --> 09:26.900
my short neck!

09:26.967 --> 09:28.501
- Mm.
- Mm.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.103
- Your neck is perfect.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.572
- No, you're on the--
hey, what's going on?

09:32.640 --> 09:35.208
- Oh, uh, sorry, every--ahh!

09:35.275 --> 09:36.209
[gasping]

09:38.578 --> 09:42.182
[uneasy music]

09:42.249 --> 09:43.383
Ugh.

09:43.450 --> 09:45.886
- There he is.

09:46.654 --> 09:48.889
You're lucky this
Abominable Snowman costume

09:48.956 --> 09:50.590
broke your fall.

09:50.658 --> 09:52.459
Let me get a look at you.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.529
I think he's having a seizure.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.199
Is anyone here a doctor?
- We're kids!

10:00.233 --> 10:02.402
- I'm fine.
I-'m-I'm fine.

10:02.469 --> 10:04.037
- All right, out of
my way, out of my way.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.338
Next of kin,
keeper of the will.

10:05.405 --> 10:06.940
- Nat, what are you doing here?

10:07.007 --> 10:08.241
- I'm your emergency contact.

10:08.308 --> 10:09.409
- What are you doing here?

10:09.476 --> 10:10.844
I let you out
of second period

10:10.911 --> 10:12.512
because you said
you had a tapeworm.

10:12.579 --> 10:15.248
- Jen, if you want to send
me to Principal Baker,

10:15.315 --> 10:18.051
I'd be happy to show him
the website

10:18.118 --> 10:20.587
where you sell
stolen school supplies.

10:20.654 --> 10:21.722
[school bell rings]

10:21.789 --> 10:23.090
- [huffs, laughs]

10:23.156 --> 10:26.059
- Ugh. Hey, why are you
my emergency contact

10:26.126 --> 10:27.427
and not Mom or Dad?

10:27.494 --> 10:29.029
- I changed it in the
school's computer system

10:29.096 --> 10:30.397
so I have an excuse
to ditch class

10:30.463 --> 10:32.032
every time you do
something clutzy

10:32.099 --> 10:33.633
and hurt yourself, which--

10:33.701 --> 10:35.135
let's be real, babe, is often.

10:35.202 --> 10:36.203
Ha!
- Truth.

10:36.269 --> 10:37.871
Up top.
- Woo!

10:37.938 --> 10:39.740
- Natalie Brandston,
are you jumping?

10:39.807 --> 10:41.909
I let you out of a Spanish
test today because

10:41.975 --> 10:43.243
you said you had a hernia.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.082
- Uhh...

10:50.517 --> 10:52.252
[clears throat]

10:53.086 --> 10:54.654
- How many teachers do
you have blackmailed?

10:54.722 --> 10:57.157
- No such thing as blackmail
among friends.

10:57.224 --> 10:59.092
- Natalie Brandston.

10:59.159 --> 11:02.462
- Ms. Reynolds, to what
do I owe the pleasure?

11:02.529 --> 11:03.897
- Just thought I would
remind you

11:03.964 --> 11:05.665
of your math test tomorrow.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.634
- Oh, I wouldn't miss it!

11:07.701 --> 11:09.903
I mean, unless a distant
relative died suddenly,

11:09.970 --> 11:11.638
or I contracted
mad cow disease.

11:11.705 --> 11:14.107
- Listen, I know how you
intimidate the other teachers.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.909
There's even a Natalie
Brandston support group

11:15.976 --> 11:17.277
that meets at lunch.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.412
But it's not going
to work on me.

11:19.479 --> 11:21.214
You're taking
that test tomorrow.

11:21.281 --> 11:22.983
If you fail, I'll see you
in winter school.

11:23.050 --> 11:25.986
And we'll add,
subtract, multiply,

11:26.053 --> 11:28.521
and divide
until the sun goes down.

11:30.157 --> 11:31.524
- Why didn't you
blackmail Ms. Reynolds?

11:31.591 --> 11:32.793
- Because I got nothing.

11:32.860 --> 11:33.927
Reynolds is mean,
but she's clean.

11:33.994 --> 11:34.995
You know what I need?

11:35.062 --> 11:36.797
- Uh, to study?
- Ew! No.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.265
I need a snow day.

11:38.331 --> 11:39.266
- Nat, I don't
think we're getting

11:39.332 --> 11:40.801
a snow day anytime soon.

11:40.868 --> 11:43.937
Rebecca Menderson is
officially #Rebeccamending

11:44.004 --> 11:45.438
wearing shorts tomorrow.

11:45.505 --> 11:47.941
- I am officially
#Rebeccamending

11:48.008 --> 11:49.042
wearing shorts tomorrow.

11:49.109 --> 11:50.543
- See?

11:50.610 --> 11:51.845
- Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.246
We got to do the snow dance.

11:53.313 --> 11:54.547
- The snow dance?
- No, we're not doing

11:54.614 --> 11:56.249
the snow dance.
- Aha! I don't think

11:56.316 --> 11:57.885
I've ever seen you dance.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.186
- Well, and that
streak shall continue.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.221
- Hal, the snow dance works.
- No, it doesn't.

12:01.288 --> 12:03.056
- It did last year.
- Like three weeks later.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.424
- So?
It's not an exact science.

12:04.491 --> 12:05.826
- It's the exact
opposite of science.

12:05.893 --> 12:07.895
- Ugh! Why can't you be
more like Snow Day Hal?

12:07.961 --> 12:09.429
- Snow Day Hal?
- Yeah, he's like

12:09.496 --> 12:11.031
a totally different
person on snow days.

12:11.098 --> 12:12.866
I mean, last year,
you successfully

12:12.933 --> 12:14.134
sledded down Dead Sled Hill.

12:14.201 --> 12:15.668
- Well, true, but that was--

12:15.735 --> 12:17.437
- And then you entered that
snowman building competition

12:17.504 --> 12:19.672
and built one that looked
so much like JoJo Siwa,

12:19.739 --> 12:21.041
it got featured on the news!

12:21.108 --> 12:22.575
- Yeah, I was proud
of Snow Snow Siwa.

12:22.642 --> 12:24.411
- And then you did
a celebratory snow lap

12:24.477 --> 12:25.879
around the block
in nothing but shorts.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.414
- Didn't even feel the cold.

12:27.480 --> 12:30.117
- Yeah, 'cause Snow Day Hal
has a whole different vibe.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.652
Snow Day Hal
is fun and fearless.

12:32.719 --> 12:35.055
- Well, isn't regular
Hal fun and fearless?

12:35.122 --> 12:36.556
- Nah.
- No.

12:38.125 --> 12:41.161
- No, there is something
freeing about a snow day.

12:41.228 --> 12:43.163
Most days, I wake up,
I'm like...

12:43.230 --> 12:45.332
this again, me again.

12:45.398 --> 12:47.901
But on a snow day,
oh, you wake up to a--

12:47.968 --> 12:49.937
to a blank white canvas

12:50.003 --> 12:52.205
just begging you
to paint something bold.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.207
- That was kind of beautiful.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.743
- Yes, it was gorgeous,
stunning,

12:56.810 --> 12:58.245
all of the fancy adjectives.

12:58.311 --> 13:00.047
Now will you do the snow
dance with me already?

13:00.113 --> 13:02.082
- A snow day would be nice.

13:02.149 --> 13:04.251
Everyone's
so carefree and happy.

13:04.317 --> 13:07.287
And that outdoor
skating rink is everything.

13:07.354 --> 13:09.056
Do your dance.
- What, now?

13:09.122 --> 13:11.424
- Yes! I won't look.

13:16.930 --> 13:19.566
- * Sha la la la la la *

13:19.632 --> 13:22.302
* Sha la la la la la *

13:22.369 --> 13:24.504
* Sha la la
la la *

13:24.571 --> 13:26.606
* Sha la la la la *

13:26.673 --> 13:29.409
* La ooh *

13:29.476 --> 13:30.477
- Hal?

13:32.145 --> 13:33.346
Hello?

13:34.814 --> 13:37.550
What are you...

13:37.617 --> 13:39.319
Ugh! Men.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.558
- In the mood for
shakes and/or cakes?

13:45.625 --> 13:47.928
- Always, but what if Claire
is at the Shake and Cake

13:47.995 --> 13:49.329
with her hot boyfriend?

13:49.396 --> 13:50.797
- Okay, was the hot necessary?

13:50.864 --> 13:53.433
- When you're as hot as
Chuck Wheeler, it kinda is.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.435
- Ooh, is hot Chuck that
hot guy in your grade

13:55.502 --> 13:57.971
who's really hot?
[giggling]

13:58.038 --> 14:01.341
[gasping, laughing]

14:01.408 --> 14:02.775
- Order number 42!

14:02.842 --> 14:04.777
Order 42!

14:04.844 --> 14:06.579
- Hey, how are you doing?

14:06.646 --> 14:08.882
- How'd you get a girl
as cool as Claire?

14:08.949 --> 14:10.850
- Ha ha. Come on.

14:10.918 --> 14:12.252
- * Love is easy, man *

14:12.319 --> 14:13.853
* You gotta keep it breezy,
man *

14:13.921 --> 14:15.688
* Tell her that she's
pretty and she's witty *

14:15.755 --> 14:18.158
* And then tell her
she's the only girl *

14:18.225 --> 14:20.627
* In the whole world you see *

14:20.693 --> 14:22.629
* And then I'll leave her
with a picture of me *

14:22.695 --> 14:23.596
- Wow!

14:23.663 --> 14:24.664
* Love is simple, man *

14:24.731 --> 14:26.266
* Sharpen up your tempo, man *

14:26.333 --> 14:29.002
* Buy a little pressy, make
a rezzy somewhere dressy *

14:29.069 --> 14:30.403
* Then pull up to her door *

14:30.470 --> 14:32.906
* She'll be begging
for more of me *

14:32.973 --> 14:34.040
- Of you!

14:34.107 --> 14:35.808
- You know that it's true.
Ow!

14:35.875 --> 14:39.179
- * Is that really all it takes
for a guy to get a date? *

14:39.246 --> 14:40.480
- * Oh! *

14:40.547 --> 14:42.482
* It's a piece of cake *

14:42.549 --> 14:43.483
Woo!

14:43.550 --> 14:45.318
- Ugh, Claire, Chuck is so hot.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.386
- He's scorching.

14:46.453 --> 14:48.188
- He's boiling like water.

14:48.255 --> 14:49.522
- Wait, what?

14:49.589 --> 14:51.058
- * Yeah, he's cute and all *

14:51.124 --> 14:52.692
* Looks good in a suit
and all *

14:52.759 --> 14:55.328
* But he doesn't focus,
didn't notice when I changed *

14:55.395 --> 14:56.896
* The way I style my hair *

14:56.964 --> 14:58.431
- Wait, what?
- I know.

14:58.498 --> 14:59.832
- * It's totally different *

14:59.899 --> 15:00.968
* You cut off 8 inches *

15:01.034 --> 15:02.369
- I know!

15:02.435 --> 15:04.037
- * But does he take
you on the town? *

15:04.104 --> 15:05.405
- * I guess he does *

15:05.472 --> 15:07.307
- * Say you're the
cutest one around? *

15:07.374 --> 15:09.309
- * Yeah, but he doesn't
ask me *

15:09.376 --> 15:10.543
* About my favorite
red things *

15:10.610 --> 15:12.179
* Am I not interesting? *

15:12.245 --> 15:13.113
- * You are *

15:13.180 --> 15:14.647
- I know.

15:14.714 --> 15:16.316
- * Is that really
all it takes *

15:16.383 --> 15:18.885
* Asking questions on a date? *

15:18.952 --> 15:20.253
- Yup, it's a piece of cake.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.422
* *

15:22.489 --> 15:25.492
- * Now I got what I want
'cause I got her *

15:25.558 --> 15:28.628
- * And maybe
this was all a mistake *

15:28.695 --> 15:31.464
- * Looking hot and
I'm feeling even hotter *

15:31.531 --> 15:34.467
- * Then tell me why can't
love be a piece of *

15:34.534 --> 15:36.336
- * Cake!
It's a piece of cake *

15:36.403 --> 15:37.904
* A piece of cake,
cake *

15:37.971 --> 15:40.407
* It's a piece of cake,
a piece of cake *

15:40.473 --> 15:42.475
* Cake,
it's a piece of cake *

15:42.542 --> 15:44.211
* A piece of cake, cake! *

15:44.277 --> 15:45.845
* It's a piece of cake *

15:45.912 --> 15:47.347
* Cake, cake *

15:47.414 --> 15:51.584
* I just wanna have my cake
and I wanna eat it, too *

15:51.651 --> 15:54.721
- * Here's a piece for you *

15:54.787 --> 15:56.223
Ooh, babe!

15:56.289 --> 15:57.657
* You look beautiful *

15:57.724 --> 15:58.925
- * Tell me something
I don't know *

15:58.992 --> 16:00.560
- * You're the most
incredible *

16:00.627 --> 16:02.329
* Of any babe
I've ever known *

16:02.395 --> 16:03.396
- * Now, isn't that sweet? *

16:03.463 --> 16:05.432
- * I'm as sweet as can be *

16:05.498 --> 16:08.168
- * The most beautiful
couple in the world *

16:08.235 --> 16:11.438
- * Do you really think
that I'm that great? *

16:11.504 --> 16:14.641
- * Without you,
my heart would ache! *

16:14.707 --> 16:17.844
Trust me, Claire,
falling in love with you

16:17.910 --> 16:19.279
was a piece of cake.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.248
- * Cake!
It's a piece of cake *

16:21.314 --> 16:23.083
* A piece of cake, cake! *

16:23.150 --> 16:24.417
* It's a piece of cake *

16:24.484 --> 16:26.053
* Oh, piece of cake, cake! *

16:26.119 --> 16:28.321
* It's a piece of cake,
a piece of cake *

16:28.388 --> 16:30.257
* Cake!
It's a piece of cake *

16:30.323 --> 16:31.791
* It's a piece of cake *

16:31.858 --> 16:33.560
* I just wanna have
my cake *

16:33.626 --> 16:36.029
* And I wanna eat it, too *

16:36.096 --> 16:37.730
* Too *

16:37.797 --> 16:39.966
- * Too *

16:40.033 --> 16:42.302
* It's a piece of cake! *

16:43.503 --> 16:45.305
- Oh, my gosh.
That was so much fun.

16:45.372 --> 16:47.040
[chatter, laughter]

16:54.147 --> 16:55.882
- Oh, come.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.120
- Chuck, you're going
to be absolutely

17:00.187 --> 17:03.423
blown away by how gorge
Claire is in the recital.

17:03.490 --> 17:05.758
- I wouldn't miss it.
When is it again?

17:05.825 --> 17:07.394
- This Saturday.

17:07.460 --> 17:08.795
- Wait, this Saturday?
- Uh-oh.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.431
- Oh, God.
- I call it Caturday.

17:13.465 --> 17:16.336
- We'll let you two
do your thing.

17:17.369 --> 17:19.506
- [clears throat]
Claire Bear,

17:19.571 --> 17:21.973
I got Syracuse football
tickets Saturday night.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.310
- What?

17:23.376 --> 17:25.444
- I didn't know it was
that important to you.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.146
- You didn't know
my dance performance

17:27.214 --> 17:29.516
was that important to me?

17:29.582 --> 17:31.551
Chuck, sometimes I think
you don't know me at all.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.553
- I know you.
- Okay.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.255
What is my favorite color?

17:35.322 --> 17:37.390
- It's, uh, the--

17:37.457 --> 17:38.391
the--

17:38.458 --> 17:39.392
- Teal.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.194
- Uh...

17:41.261 --> 17:43.596
- Okay, what food
can I not stand?

17:43.663 --> 17:46.933
- That's easy.
It's the s-spaghetti?

17:46.999 --> 17:48.235
Uh...

17:48.301 --> 17:50.203
- Pickles.
- They're pickles!

17:50.270 --> 17:51.504
- Well, what's
my favorite food?

17:51.571 --> 17:53.373
- Toast.
- Heck yeah it is.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.242
Soft and crunchy
at the same time.

17:55.308 --> 17:56.876
- Oh, my gosh.
Okay, we're done.

17:56.943 --> 17:58.178
Just go.

17:58.245 --> 18:00.547
- Whoa. Are you seriously
breaking up with me

18:00.613 --> 18:02.249
because I don't know
your favorite color?

18:02.315 --> 18:04.817
- I don't know what I'm
going to do yet, so just go.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.119
- Fine!

18:09.189 --> 18:10.423
Brown.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.392
- Nobody's favorite
color is brown!

18:12.459 --> 18:14.127
- I think brown
is kinda cool.

18:19.065 --> 18:20.567
- What happened, babe?

18:20.633 --> 18:22.202
- We heard every word.

18:22.269 --> 18:24.804
- Missy, why?
- Missy, think before you talk!

18:25.738 --> 18:27.974
- You should go talk to her.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.609
- You say that like it's not
the most terrifying thing

18:29.676 --> 18:30.810
I could possibly imagine.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.912
- You just need an icebreaker.

18:36.383 --> 18:37.617
What's that?

18:37.684 --> 18:39.051
- After I fell today,

18:39.118 --> 18:40.953
I found Claire's
missing whale necklace.

18:41.020 --> 18:42.822
- This is amazing.

18:42.889 --> 18:44.824
You have a reason
to talk to her.

18:44.891 --> 18:47.427
- Yeah, but I also
have to say words.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.429
- Well, lucky for you,

18:49.496 --> 18:51.097
you have a female best friend

18:51.164 --> 18:52.732
and a rather cool one,
if I'm being honest.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.000
- Okay, get to the point.

18:54.066 --> 18:57.103
- What I, a girl,
would want you, a guy,

18:57.170 --> 19:00.273
to do right now is walk over,
take out that necklace,

19:00.340 --> 19:01.941
and say, super cas...

19:02.008 --> 19:04.744
"I thought
you might be missing this."

19:04.811 --> 19:07.580
- So what you're telling me
is that I have to have swag?

19:07.647 --> 19:09.416
Something I've never
possessed my whole life.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.550
- Precisely.
- Ah.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.352
- Here, try it on me.
- No.

19:12.419 --> 19:14.687
- Come on.
You want to get the girl?

19:14.754 --> 19:16.789
You got to do it.
Come on, Hal.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.491
You got this.
- Okay, okay.

19:21.661 --> 19:22.995
Hey, I, uh...

19:23.062 --> 19:25.432
I thought you might
be missing this.

19:26.533 --> 19:27.767
- [laughs]

19:27.834 --> 19:29.869
- Lane.
- I'm sorry.

19:29.936 --> 19:31.504
What are you doing
with your eyebrows?

19:31.571 --> 19:33.773
- I don't know.
- Well, don't do it.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.876
- What, don't do this?
- [laughs]

19:36.943 --> 19:38.878
All right, go get
us some cake, swaggy Hal.

19:38.945 --> 19:41.080
- Oh, it would be swaggy
Hal's greatest pleasure.

19:41.147 --> 19:43.082
- Ha ha.
- Huh huh.

19:43.149 --> 19:47.220
* *

19:47.287 --> 19:49.689
[gasping]

19:51.057 --> 19:53.226
- Your shirt is
so much cuter green.

19:53.293 --> 19:54.527
Smile!

19:54.594 --> 19:56.329
- Put the phone down.
- Missy, timing.

19:56.396 --> 19:58.265
- Oh, shoot, it's a video.

19:58.331 --> 20:00.400
Here's the guy who helped
Claire's shirt be better.

20:00.467 --> 20:01.668
Say hi, guy.

20:01.734 --> 20:04.971
- Missy!
- Missy!

20:09.909 --> 20:10.843
- Ugh!

20:12.779 --> 20:14.814
- Whatever problems
you're having,

20:14.881 --> 20:17.517
trust me, mine are
20 times worse.

20:17.584 --> 20:18.951
- It's just not fair.

20:19.018 --> 20:21.621
Math has no practical
application in life.

20:21.688 --> 20:24.324
Ever heard of a calculator?

20:24.391 --> 20:26.459
- You know what, I bet
if you tried really hard,

20:26.526 --> 20:28.060
you could pass that test
tomorrow.

20:28.127 --> 20:29.896
- Yeah. I bet that if
you tried really hard,

20:29.962 --> 20:31.998
you could run a 30-minute mile.

20:33.766 --> 20:36.603
Looks like it's winter school
for your old pal Natalie.

20:41.574 --> 20:42.809
- [sighs]

20:42.875 --> 20:45.044
- Snow dance?
- Snow dance!

20:47.614 --> 20:48.948
[rhythmic chanting]
- Fee, fi, fum, fo!

20:49.015 --> 20:51.150
You and me are gonna
make it snow!

20:51.217 --> 20:52.585
Woo!

20:52.652 --> 20:54.854
We're gonna make it
fall onto the floor!

20:54.921 --> 20:55.722
Woo!

20:55.788 --> 20:57.490
Here we go, here we go!

20:57.557 --> 20:59.759
S-N-O-W and me

20:59.826 --> 21:01.260
are double trouble

21:01.328 --> 21:02.462
- Bring it on down, Nat!

21:02.529 --> 21:03.696
Bring it on down, Nat!

21:03.763 --> 21:04.864
- I'm bringing it down!
- Woo!

21:04.931 --> 21:05.898
Bring it on down, Nat.

21:05.965 --> 21:07.300
Bring it on down,
Nat!

21:07.367 --> 21:09.369
- Woo!
Make it snow, bro.

21:09.436 --> 21:10.403
Make it snow, bro.

21:10.470 --> 21:11.438
- Ooh, ooh.

21:11.504 --> 21:12.605
- Make it snow, bro.

21:12.672 --> 21:14.240
Make it snow, bro.

21:14.307 --> 21:15.675
- Ah, shimmy to the right.

21:15.742 --> 21:17.076
And shimmy to the left.

21:17.143 --> 21:18.945
And jump until
you're out of breath,

21:19.011 --> 21:20.246
and jump until you're
out of breath,

21:20.313 --> 21:21.948
and jump until
you're out of breath!

21:22.014 --> 21:24.517
- Jump until
you're out of...breath.

21:24.584 --> 21:26.419
Whew! Okay.

21:26.486 --> 21:28.821
Now on the off, off chance
that that didn't work,

21:28.888 --> 21:30.557
you should probably study.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.325
- First, I gotta
find my math book.

21:32.392 --> 21:33.426
That's history.

21:33.493 --> 21:36.162
- [laughs]

21:36.228 --> 21:38.565
- Man, I'm surprised
you're in such good spirits.

21:38.631 --> 21:39.999
- Why?

21:40.066 --> 21:41.634
- Oh, no reason.

21:41.701 --> 21:43.202
I mean...

21:44.971 --> 21:46.072
Someone took a video of you

21:46.138 --> 21:47.607
spilling a milkshake
on Claire Bonner

21:47.674 --> 21:49.041
that kind of went viral.

21:49.108 --> 21:50.309
- What?

21:50.377 --> 21:52.244
- Your shirt is so much
cuter green,

21:52.311 --> 21:54.614
g-g-green.
C-c-cuter. Smile!

21:54.681 --> 21:55.915
Sm-sm-smile.

21:55.982 --> 21:58.351
Say hi, guy.
Say hi, guy.

21:58.418 --> 22:00.052
* *

22:00.119 --> 22:02.989
- * I know
I'm not the coolest guy *

22:03.055 --> 22:05.392
* I'm not the one
that most girls like *

22:05.458 --> 22:08.227
* But maybe, maybe
I've got a chance *

22:08.294 --> 22:09.996
* *

22:10.062 --> 22:12.264
* I'd go up and give a try *

22:12.331 --> 22:14.934
* Have the guts,
it'd be just fine *

22:15.001 --> 22:19.138
* But maybe, maybe
I've got a chance *

22:19.205 --> 22:21.774
* But do I do it?
Maybe, I think so *

22:21.841 --> 22:24.977
* Do I do it?
What if you say no? *

22:25.044 --> 22:27.680
* I can't make up my mind *

22:27.747 --> 22:30.717
* So I need a sign *

22:30.783 --> 22:32.585
* Something that I can see *

22:32.652 --> 22:35.722
* Can you give me a sign? *

22:35.788 --> 22:38.558
* Something to guide me *

22:38.625 --> 22:40.760
* Show me what to do *

22:40.827 --> 22:42.395
* How do I make a move? *

22:42.462 --> 22:43.663
* I need a sign *

22:43.730 --> 22:45.131
* *

22:45.197 --> 22:47.467

22:51.771 --> 22:53.406
* I need a sign *

22:53.473 --> 22:54.741

22:54.807 --> 22:57.243

22:57.309 --> 22:59.646
* I don't know
what I should do *

22:59.712 --> 23:02.114
* How could I ever talk
to you? *

23:02.181 --> 23:04.717
* It's feeling crazy
just to try *

23:04.784 --> 23:06.318
* *

23:06.385 --> 23:08.921
* But do I do it?
Maybe, I think so *

23:08.988 --> 23:12.091
* Do I do it?
What if you say no? *

23:12.158 --> 23:14.994
* I can't make up my mind *

23:15.061 --> 23:16.629
* So I need a sign *

23:18.164 --> 23:19.799

Sign, sign, sign, sign...

[wistful music]

23:53.700 --> 23:55.502

23:59.005 --> 24:02.709
[dogs barking in distance]

24:14.453 --> 24:15.955
- [gasp] Whoa!

24:16.022 --> 24:19.091
[light music]

24:19.158 --> 24:20.660
[giggling]

24:20.727 --> 24:23.362
- In addition to supermarkets
and convenience stores,

24:23.429 --> 24:25.331
all gas stations
are also closed

24:25.397 --> 24:28.067
due to last night's
unprecedented snowstorm.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.769
When I woke up
and looked out the window,

24:29.836 --> 24:31.170
I thought I was dreaming.

24:31.237 --> 24:33.305
I mean,
I went to bed in shorts.

24:33.372 --> 24:35.575
- Nobody asked for your
life story, Deborah.

24:35.642 --> 24:37.476
Give the people what they want!

24:37.544 --> 24:41.413
- Oh, and all
schools are canceled.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.749
Happy snow day!

24:42.815 --> 24:44.651
- Snow day!

24:44.717 --> 24:46.285
- Uhh--

24:46.352 --> 24:48.988
- ...Daaay!

24:50.523 --> 24:52.124
We did it!
- We did it.

24:52.191 --> 24:53.826
[laughter]

24:53.893 --> 24:56.128
Blank canvas.

24:56.195 --> 24:57.463
My sign.

24:57.530 --> 24:59.031
I'm Snow Day Hal.

24:59.098 --> 25:01.500
- Welcome, Snow Day Hal!
So what's first?

25:01.568 --> 25:04.771
Skiing, ice fishing,
skiing while ice fishing?

25:04.837 --> 25:06.639
- Actually,
I'm gonna spend today

25:06.706 --> 25:08.608
trying to get the girl
who's way out of my league

25:08.675 --> 25:10.042
and has a boyfriend.

25:10.109 --> 25:11.611
- That's my swaggy brother.

25:11.678 --> 25:14.113
- And hey, you have a full day
to study for that math test.

25:14.180 --> 25:16.448
- No, I have a full day to
get us a second snow day.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.050
And then it's winter break.

25:18.117 --> 25:19.952
- Okay, well, how do you plan
on getting a second snow day?

25:20.019 --> 25:21.120
If it stops snowing,

25:21.187 --> 25:22.689
these roads
are going to get cleared,

25:22.755 --> 25:24.957
and that means everything will
open back up again tomorrow,

25:25.024 --> 25:26.425
including school.

25:26.492 --> 25:28.861
- Not if I stop the guy
who plows the roads.

25:28.928 --> 25:30.096
[ominous music]

25:30.162 --> 25:32.665
- Stop Snowplowman?

25:32.732 --> 25:34.133
You know, but he's a maniac.

25:34.200 --> 25:37.136
[honking]
- Move it! Get outta the way!

25:37.203 --> 25:38.938
- I heard he drinks
wolf blood before plowing

25:39.005 --> 25:40.439
to get into beast mode.

25:40.506 --> 25:41.908
And that he ripped the braces
off the last kid

25:41.974 --> 25:43.109
who tried to stop him

25:43.175 --> 25:44.443
and turned them
into brass knuckles.

25:44.510 --> 25:46.278
- Well, lucky for me,
I have perfect teeth.

25:46.345 --> 25:48.247
Plus, anything can
happen on a snow day.

25:48.314 --> 25:51.550
- Nat, going after
Snowplowman is kinda insane.

25:51.618 --> 25:53.385
- Says the guy
who's going after the girl

25:53.452 --> 25:56.322
who's way out of his league
and has a boyfriend.

25:57.857 --> 25:58.791
- Take him down, sis.

25:58.858 --> 26:00.860
- Get the girl, bro.

26:02.428 --> 26:03.996
Hey, Hal.

26:04.063 --> 26:06.733
If we get a second snow day,
wanna spend it together?

26:06.799 --> 26:08.367
- That's a deal.

26:18.410 --> 26:19.679
- Hi. Ha.

26:19.746 --> 26:21.881
- Hello, darling.
Eli and Wayne are in the fort.

26:21.948 --> 26:23.115
- Oh, I'm sorry.

26:23.182 --> 26:25.051
I didn't realize
Eli had a sister.

26:25.117 --> 26:27.119
- [laughs] Oh, Natalie.

26:27.186 --> 26:28.621
[video sounds]
- Die, werewolf, die!

26:28.688 --> 26:29.756
- I'm losing, Elf Boy!

26:29.822 --> 26:30.857
- Move!

26:30.923 --> 26:32.291
- What are you bozos doing?

26:32.358 --> 26:33.893
- We're playing
this marvelous video game

26:33.960 --> 26:35.461
wherein one attempts
to ward off werewolves

26:35.527 --> 26:36.829
whilst building a shack.

26:36.896 --> 26:39.165
- It's called Werewolf Shack.
- Care to play?

26:39.231 --> 26:40.432
- Hey!
- Hey!

26:40.499 --> 26:42.234
- Hey, yourselves!

26:42.301 --> 26:44.837
Don't you guys realize that
today is no ordinary day?

26:44.904 --> 26:46.038
Today's a snow day.

26:46.105 --> 26:47.940
That means anything can happen.

26:48.007 --> 26:49.709
We can do anything we want.

26:49.776 --> 26:51.043
So do you wanna
spend the day

26:51.110 --> 26:52.444
taking down lame,
fake werewolves,

26:52.511 --> 26:54.146
or do you wanna
spend the day

26:54.213 --> 26:56.415
taking down
someone scary and real?

26:56.482 --> 26:57.416
- Like who?

26:57.483 --> 26:58.885
- Snowplowman.

26:58.951 --> 27:00.853
[gasping]
- Snowplowman?

27:00.920 --> 27:03.022
But he's a maniac.

27:03.089 --> 27:05.958
I heard a man once
made fun of his snow plow,

27:06.025 --> 27:07.960
so he plowed
the chap's motorcar.

27:08.027 --> 27:10.529
- Listen.
If we take down Snowplowman,

27:10.596 --> 27:11.964
we get a second snow day.

27:12.031 --> 27:13.866
- No, that's way too dangerous.

27:13.933 --> 27:15.567
- Well, if we don't try,

27:15.634 --> 27:17.203
then you guys
won't see me all break,

27:17.269 --> 27:18.771
because I'll be
in winter school.

27:18.838 --> 27:19.772
- Nonsense, my queen.

27:19.839 --> 27:21.007
I fight with you.
- Great.

27:21.073 --> 27:22.308
You in, Wayne?

27:22.374 --> 27:23.442
- Does this answer
your question?

27:23.509 --> 27:25.011
Yeah!

27:25.077 --> 27:26.979
- Who are we taking down?

27:27.046 --> 27:30.049
all: Snowplowman!

27:30.116 --> 27:31.350
[computer chime]

27:31.417 --> 27:34.653
- Freeze!
This is Sheriff Randy.

27:34.721 --> 27:37.957
You better not steal
something, or I got you, babe.

27:38.024 --> 27:39.425
- Oh, okay.

27:39.491 --> 27:40.893
- [whispering]
Steal something!

27:40.960 --> 27:42.829
- Uh, Sheriff, well, I can't.

27:42.895 --> 27:44.263
I'm working.

27:44.330 --> 27:47.199
- But do you believe
in play after work?

27:47.266 --> 27:49.401
- No, it's a snow day, people.

27:49.468 --> 27:52.071
- Well, it's not a snow day
for mommies and daddies.

27:52.138 --> 27:53.873
We still have to work.
Sorry, bud.

27:53.940 --> 27:55.775
- Okay.

27:55.842 --> 27:57.744
- What am I doing with
these taxes right here?

27:57.810 --> 28:00.713
[clicking sound]
Oh, uh, Randy, what did I say?

28:00.780 --> 28:03.415
I was working, right?
Remember, I just said that?

28:03.482 --> 28:06.318
- You have the right
to remain silent.

28:06.385 --> 28:08.687
- Oh, very funny.
But--

28:08.755 --> 28:11.958
- Bet you wish you could
turn back time now.

28:12.024 --> 28:13.359
- Sheriff, we appreciate--

28:13.425 --> 28:14.894
- Sorry.
- That you are

28:14.961 --> 28:18.030
a musical officer of the law
and that we're being no fun,

28:18.097 --> 28:19.365
but we really do have to work.
So...

28:19.431 --> 28:20.599
- Ow.

28:20.666 --> 28:21.801
- If you could take
these off, please?

28:21.868 --> 28:23.502
- Yeah, I mean we have to
meet our deadline

28:23.569 --> 28:25.704
so that we can
make money to buy you,

28:25.772 --> 28:29.809
you know, hats and wigs
and badges and water guns.

28:29.876 --> 28:31.643
- Hand over the devices.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.312
- No, come on.
- Yes.

28:33.379 --> 28:35.581
- My computer?
- Yes.

28:35.647 --> 28:37.016
- All right, fine,
but that's it.

28:37.083 --> 28:39.585
I need to use my phone.
- And the phones.

28:39.651 --> 28:41.420
Come on.

28:41.487 --> 28:42.755
All of them.

28:42.822 --> 28:43.890
- That's all we have.

28:43.956 --> 28:45.792
[phone rings]

28:45.858 --> 28:47.026
Where was that one?

28:47.093 --> 28:48.360
Okay, you have
all of our stuff.

28:48.427 --> 28:51.397
Now can you please uncuff us?

28:51.463 --> 28:54.000
- Not until I have
the perfect snow day.

28:54.066 --> 28:56.335
And first, I want
the perfect pancakes.

28:56.402 --> 28:57.937
- [scoffs]
- No, w--

28:58.004 --> 29:01.073
- Kinda hard to do that when
you're handcuffed together.

29:01.140 --> 29:02.574
- Yeah.

29:02.641 --> 29:06.212
- Then I suppose you'll
have to make them together.

29:08.547 --> 29:09.982
- Oh! Hoo!

29:10.049 --> 29:11.483
[laughter]

29:11.550 --> 29:12.484
- Ah!

29:12.551 --> 29:14.653
- Come here!

29:14.720 --> 29:17.223
- Okay, let's beat the rush
to the rink--come on.

29:17.289 --> 29:18.858
- Oh, I can't.
- Why not?

29:18.925 --> 29:20.626
- Well, because
I'm Snow Day Hal,

29:20.692 --> 29:22.962
and I can't let whatever
comes over me on a snow day

29:23.029 --> 29:24.596
go to waste, so...

29:24.663 --> 29:26.265
I'm gonna get Claire.

29:26.332 --> 29:27.566
- Oh.
Hm.

29:27.633 --> 29:29.468
- What?
- No, nothing, I just--

29:29.535 --> 29:31.070
I thought
I'd be spending the snow day

29:31.137 --> 29:33.105
with my best friend,
which is exactly

29:33.172 --> 29:35.007
what I'm gonna do,
'cause you need

29:35.074 --> 29:36.475
all the help you can get.

29:36.542 --> 29:38.777
- You're my hero.
- No lies detected.

29:38.845 --> 29:40.779
Now, let's see the plan.

29:40.847 --> 29:41.814
- The plan?

29:41.881 --> 29:43.782
- Hal, I know you.

29:43.850 --> 29:46.218
You have a handwritten plan
complete with funny drawings

29:46.285 --> 29:47.887
somewhere on you.

29:47.954 --> 29:49.721
Let's see it.

29:49.788 --> 29:52.091
- [sighs]
Fine.

29:54.093 --> 29:56.362
- [reading]

29:56.428 --> 29:57.763
Wait, why by sundown?
- Well, because

29:57.830 --> 29:59.365
it's a snow day.
When the sun goes down,

29:59.431 --> 30:00.933
it'll be a snow night,
and that's not a thing.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.302
- So what's the first step?
Wear this really cool sweater?

30:03.369 --> 30:05.437
- Hey, I like this sweater.

30:05.504 --> 30:07.173
- Oh ho ho.
I'm aware you do.

30:07.239 --> 30:09.675
- No, first step,
make an impression.

30:09.741 --> 30:13.412
I'm going to go to her
house and hold this up.

30:15.781 --> 30:17.449
- I don't get it.

30:17.516 --> 30:19.818
- What?
Whale you, like...

30:19.886 --> 30:21.020
like
will you go out with me?

30:21.087 --> 30:22.321
Only it's whale you
go out with me

30:22.388 --> 30:23.489
because of the whale necklace.

30:23.555 --> 30:25.224
Man, I thought that was clear.

30:25.291 --> 30:28.127
- [laughs]
I'm messing with you.

30:28.194 --> 30:29.128
It's whale-y good.

30:29.195 --> 30:30.662
- Whale-y?

30:30.729 --> 30:31.797
- Would I say "whale-y"
if I didn't whale-y,

30:31.864 --> 30:32.831
whale-y mean it?

30:32.899 --> 30:34.200
[laughs]

30:35.634 --> 30:37.569
- Yeah, okay, that's her house.

30:37.636 --> 30:39.238
- Good luck.
- Hey, Snow Day Hal

30:39.305 --> 30:40.772
doesn't need luck.
- Yeah.

30:40.839 --> 30:43.375
[engine roaring]

30:43.442 --> 30:45.978
- Okay, maybe a little luck.

30:46.045 --> 30:47.579
Go, go, go.

30:56.622 --> 31:00.326
- Claire Bear,
I have something to say!

31:02.028 --> 31:03.429
- What is it, Chuck?

31:03.495 --> 31:04.796
Are you going to miss
my birthday next year

31:04.863 --> 31:06.198
for a toast convention?

31:06.265 --> 31:08.968
- Look, that Chuck
yesterday was old Chuck.

31:09.035 --> 31:10.436
This is new Chuck.

31:10.502 --> 31:12.671
And new Chuck would
drop anything for you.

31:12.738 --> 31:15.741
- Hmm.
Why should I believe you now?

31:19.411 --> 31:21.480
- If it wasn't clear,

31:21.547 --> 31:24.516
I just ripped the Syracuse
football game ticket in half.

31:27.086 --> 31:28.754
- All right, come in.

31:31.023 --> 31:33.092
- Let's--let's go get
some hot chocolate.

31:33.159 --> 31:35.094
Your treat, come on.

31:35.161 --> 31:36.795
- No, no, no, no.

31:36.862 --> 31:40.132
Normally, this would be defeat,
but not for Snow Day Hal.

31:40.199 --> 31:41.567
I could still make
an impression.

31:41.633 --> 31:43.869
I just gotta, uh...
just gotta plan my next move.

31:43.936 --> 31:46.805
- Well, Chuck's in her house,
and you're not.

31:46.872 --> 31:48.907
- Wait, wait.

31:52.278 --> 31:53.512
I'm going to get
in her house, too.

31:53.579 --> 31:54.880
- Wait, Hal,
her house is that way.

31:54.947 --> 31:56.548
What is your freak--
it's just here.

31:56.615 --> 31:57.749
- You'll see.
- But it's--

31:57.816 --> 31:59.185
- Anything can
happen on a snow day.

31:59.251 --> 32:00.352
- Wait!
Wait!

32:00.419 --> 32:01.587
Shoes.
Lift.

32:01.653 --> 32:04.056
- Okay, quickly.
- Yeah.

32:04.123 --> 32:05.958
Who am I?
- You're my hero. Bye!

32:06.025 --> 32:07.559
- Bye.

32:07.626 --> 32:09.928
- Okay, guys, if we're going
to take down a living monster

32:09.996 --> 32:11.897
and get a second snow day,
these snowballs

32:11.964 --> 32:13.199
got to be packed tight.

32:13.265 --> 32:15.101
- Fine.

32:15.167 --> 32:17.569
- Lucky for us, Snowplowman
overposts on social media,

32:17.636 --> 32:19.305
so I know he's stopping
right around here from

32:19.371 --> 32:20.806
mid-morning until we break.

32:20.872 --> 32:22.741
- And I did a few
calculations to determine

32:22.808 --> 32:24.310
how the wind chill
factor might affect

32:24.376 --> 32:25.677
the arc of the snowball.

32:25.744 --> 32:26.745
- Ew, math.

32:26.812 --> 32:28.047
We're good.

32:28.114 --> 32:29.048
Wayne, you've got
a sling for us?

32:29.115 --> 32:30.382
- Right here.

32:30.449 --> 32:32.284
- [laughing]

32:32.351 --> 32:33.452
- Don't laugh at me.

32:33.519 --> 32:35.487
It's my grandma's, okay?

32:35.554 --> 32:37.123
It's the best I can
do on short notice.

32:37.189 --> 32:38.790
- Okay.

32:38.857 --> 32:40.059
Plan is to distract
him with the balls

32:40.126 --> 32:41.360
and then jab a hole
in one of his tires.

32:41.427 --> 32:42.461
- Brilliant.

32:42.528 --> 32:43.996
- Not the way to
go if you ask me.

32:44.063 --> 32:44.997
- We didn't.

32:45.064 --> 32:46.498
- Fine.

32:46.565 --> 32:48.000
Then you won't get to
hear my genius idea.

32:48.067 --> 32:49.135
- Good.

32:49.201 --> 32:50.202
- Sinkhole.

32:50.269 --> 32:51.537
- What's a sinkhole?

32:51.603 --> 32:53.305
- A cavity in the ground
caused by erosion.

32:53.372 --> 32:56.208
One does not simply
create a sinkhole.

32:56.275 --> 32:58.277
- Not with that attitude.

32:58.344 --> 33:02.148
[honking]

33:02.214 --> 33:03.882
- Snowplowman.

33:03.949 --> 33:07.453
[dramatic music]

33:07.519 --> 33:09.188
- Snowplowman, pull over!

33:09.255 --> 33:12.024
The sunlight is hitting us
at an ideal angle,

33:12.091 --> 33:15.994
and I would like to suggest
taking a commemorative selfie.

33:17.063 --> 33:18.564
- Great idea, Trudy.

33:18.630 --> 33:20.266
You know, they don't make
them like you anymore.

33:20.332 --> 33:22.000
- Actually, they do.

33:22.068 --> 33:24.903
I'm a standard artificial
intelligence device

33:24.970 --> 33:28.174
that you program to
remind you to eat, tell you

33:28.240 --> 33:30.176
that you're handsome...
- Hey.

33:30.242 --> 33:32.111
- You're not a disappointment
to your mother.

33:32.178 --> 33:33.312
- Okay, selfie time!

33:33.379 --> 33:35.281
- Mm-hmm.

33:35.347 --> 33:38.217
Cheese!

33:38.284 --> 33:39.251
[camera lens snaps]

33:39.318 --> 33:40.852
- Oh, that is a framer.

33:42.321 --> 33:45.357
* I love
clearing snow in winter *

33:45.424 --> 33:48.627
* And seeing the
pavement shine through *

33:48.694 --> 33:51.963
* I love driving
in a blizzard *

33:52.030 --> 33:55.134
* The cold
and my lips turning blue *

33:55.201 --> 33:58.904
* I love holiday movies
and acai smoothies *

33:58.970 --> 34:01.006
* And Trudy,
I love you to bits *

34:01.073 --> 34:02.574
- Aww.

34:02.641 --> 34:06.112
- * But I hate, hate, hate,
hate, hate these kids *

34:06.178 --> 34:08.746
* *

34:08.813 --> 34:11.917
* I love the thrill of
online shopping *

34:11.983 --> 34:14.786
* For gadgets
to spruce up my ride *

34:14.853 --> 34:18.623
* I love staying up
and watching the Tonys *

34:18.690 --> 34:20.792
* With Mom by my side *

34:20.859 --> 34:23.929
* I love small vegan cafes
and pumpkin spice lattes *

34:23.995 --> 34:26.697
* And a good social media
blitz *

34:26.764 --> 34:31.002
* But I hate, hate, hate,
hate, hate these kids *

34:31.069 --> 34:32.638
* *

34:32.704 --> 34:36.275
* At the first snowflake
of the season *

34:36.342 --> 34:39.545
* I shed a tear of joy *

34:39.610 --> 34:42.181
* A mission
that I can believe in *

34:42.248 --> 34:47.085
* To make sure
their dreams are destroyed! *

34:47.152 --> 34:50.021
* I love setting up
my playlist *

34:50.088 --> 34:53.024
* The ultimate
mega plow mix! *

34:53.091 --> 34:56.094
* I love my rising
social status *

34:56.161 --> 34:58.964
* And rocking
these customized kicks *

34:59.030 --> 35:02.434
* I love night vision cameras
and matching pajamas *

35:02.501 --> 35:05.003
* Love being the guy
who admits *

35:05.070 --> 35:09.575
* That I hate hate, hate,
hate, hate these kids *

35:09.641 --> 35:12.077
* *

35:12.144 --> 35:15.714
* This time of year
takes me right back *

35:15.781 --> 35:18.650
* To that fateful
snow day past *

35:18.717 --> 35:21.453
* I was only eight years old *

35:21.520 --> 35:24.523
* *

35:24.590 --> 35:27.426
* I had a brand new
snow plow toy *

35:27.493 --> 35:30.396
* Steering, racing,
so much joy *

35:30.462 --> 35:34.800
* I couldn't even
feel the cold *

35:34.866 --> 35:36.568
* Then they stuck up
from behind *

35:36.635 --> 35:38.069
* They ripped it from
my grasp *

35:38.136 --> 35:39.871
* They stole it--
gone forever! *

35:39.938 --> 35:41.973
* They pointed
and they laughed *

35:42.040 --> 35:46.812
* The rudest, meanest
gang of nasty kids *

35:46.878 --> 35:48.647
* From that day on *

35:48.714 --> 35:54.786
* I vowed to make them
suffer like I did *

35:54.853 --> 35:57.088
- Therapy appointment
scheduled Monday, 9:00 a.m.

35:57.155 --> 35:58.824
- Trudy, not now!

35:58.890 --> 36:01.793
* I love laughing
in their faces! *

36:01.860 --> 36:05.231
* Now it's my turn to be mean *

36:05.297 --> 36:10.569
* I love people of all ages,
except if they're under 18 *

36:10.636 --> 36:12.271
* I love having the power *

36:12.338 --> 36:16.275
* I know it's my hour to wipe
snow days right off the grid *

36:16.342 --> 36:19.978
* Because I hate, hate,
hate, hate, hate these *

36:20.045 --> 36:22.814
* Just can't tolerate these *

36:22.881 --> 36:28.186
* Hate, hate, hate,
hate, hate these kids! *

36:32.358 --> 36:33.959
- Okay, here he comes.

36:34.025 --> 36:35.927
Snowball me.
- Yes, my lady.

36:35.994 --> 36:37.829
- Wayne, get that sling ready.
- Eli, catch.

36:37.896 --> 36:38.997
- Got it.

36:40.566 --> 36:42.368
- Ah!

36:42.434 --> 36:44.035
Yeah!

36:44.102 --> 36:45.337
Snack time, Trudy.

36:45.404 --> 36:46.472
- Mm-mm.

36:46.538 --> 36:49.107
- Oh, my favorite, anchovies.

36:49.174 --> 36:50.342
- Very pungent.

36:50.409 --> 36:51.877
- You know where
you're going, huh?

36:51.943 --> 36:52.978
- [grunt]

36:53.044 --> 36:54.112
- Uhh--

36:54.179 --> 36:55.414
- Give me the piercer.

36:55.481 --> 36:57.082
Now throw, throw, throw!

36:59.217 --> 37:00.419
- Kids.

37:00.486 --> 37:02.554
- There they are!

37:02.621 --> 37:05.156
[suspenseful music]

37:05.223 --> 37:07.426
- Hey!
- Hey, children, stop that!

37:07.493 --> 37:09.361
- Stop it!
- Oh, you bad kids!

37:09.428 --> 37:11.263
- Knock it off! Hey!

37:11.330 --> 37:13.865
Oh, I'm gonna get you.

37:13.932 --> 37:16.234
Knock it off!
- Do something, Snowplowman!

37:16.302 --> 37:17.269
- Stop throwing!

37:17.336 --> 37:19.070
[air hissing]

37:22.207 --> 37:23.509
[groans]

37:25.377 --> 37:26.978
Flat tire, huh?

37:29.281 --> 37:31.216
[laughing]

37:35.987 --> 37:38.290
Trudy, activate mega cannon.

37:38.357 --> 37:39.257
- Activated!

37:40.826 --> 37:43.194
Here...we...go...

37:43.261 --> 37:45.631
- Snow in the hole!

37:46.865 --> 37:48.166
Scatter!

37:49.935 --> 37:51.903
Trudy, you got 'em targeted?
- Bull's-eye.

37:51.970 --> 37:53.805
- Hey, wait!
- We've gotta get out of here!

37:53.872 --> 37:55.441
- Nice try, kiddies.

37:55.507 --> 37:57.576
You ain't getting
no second snow day.

38:00.546 --> 38:02.714
- Nothing is a bigger
threat to fashion than snow.

38:02.781 --> 38:05.183
- Ugh!
Why can't you just be longer?

38:05.250 --> 38:07.085
- That's why I'm here
to officially

38:07.152 --> 38:10.456
#Rebeccamend you start your
early afternoon off with a...

38:10.522 --> 38:12.290
- Hey, babe.
- Butter's in the fridge.

38:12.358 --> 38:13.492
- Love you.

38:13.559 --> 38:14.526
- Chuck.

38:14.593 --> 38:15.861
- Yeah, babe.

38:15.927 --> 38:17.429
- Make sure the toaster
is plugged in.

38:17.496 --> 38:19.431
- Who's better than you?

38:20.065 --> 38:21.867
- This way,
you're gonna keep warm

38:21.933 --> 38:23.535
without having to
sacrifice your silhouette.

38:23.602 --> 38:25.303
- Claire!
Claire Bonner!

38:25.371 --> 38:28.774
- Um, I'm Rebecca,
Rebecca Menderson.

38:28.840 --> 38:31.343
- Uh, yeah, I know,
and-and letting me speak

38:31.410 --> 38:33.445
for a moment would be
my official #Rebeccamendation.

38:33.512 --> 38:35.547
- [gasp] That is trademarked!

38:35.614 --> 38:38.083
- Claire Bonner, hi.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.386
My name is--is Hal Brandston.

38:40.452 --> 38:43.121
You probably don't know me
other than yesterday's

38:43.188 --> 38:45.391
milkshake malfunction,
but I know you.

38:45.457 --> 38:48.494
I know that when you're
nervous, you eat candy corn.

38:48.560 --> 38:50.095
I know that you hate pickles.

38:50.161 --> 38:52.330
And I know that you love
to dance more than anything

38:52.398 --> 38:54.400
in the world.
- Okay, yeah, this is--

38:54.466 --> 38:55.734
this is great.

38:55.801 --> 38:57.002
This is really sweet
and all, but I'm

38:57.068 --> 38:58.770
going to have to
officially #Rebeccamend

38:58.837 --> 39:00.506
that you leave immediately,
or I'm going to call security.

39:00.572 --> 39:02.207
- Security?
- Security!

39:04.342 --> 39:06.011
Dad!

39:12.518 --> 39:15.353
- I still think a sinkhole
would be way more efficient.

39:15.421 --> 39:17.756
- I truly don't know how many
more times I can tolerate him

39:17.823 --> 39:19.491
saying the word "sinkhole."

39:19.558 --> 39:22.227
- Let's try this first and then
revisit sinkhole, okay, buddy?

39:22.293 --> 39:24.730
- Well, my grandma needs
this wig back by 4:00.

39:24.796 --> 39:27.198
She's not too happy that
I stole her bra either.

39:27.265 --> 39:29.134
- Snowplowman
is about 45 seconds away.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.469
- How do you know?

39:30.536 --> 39:31.637
- I took the liberty of
adding a tracking device

39:31.703 --> 39:33.805
to one of
the snowballs you launched.

39:33.872 --> 39:35.941
- Does this coat
make me look boxy?

39:36.007 --> 39:37.776
[honking]
- Shh!

39:37.843 --> 39:39.244
He's coming.

39:39.310 --> 39:41.146
Let's go!

39:43.549 --> 39:44.916
- Oh, no, is it snowing?

39:44.983 --> 39:46.351
My grandma's going
to kill me if she

39:46.418 --> 39:48.286
finds out I got her hat wet!
- Just get out there!

39:48.353 --> 39:49.988
I'm not taking that test.

39:51.457 --> 39:52.524
- Danger!
- Aah!

39:52.591 --> 39:53.792
- Stop!
- Danger!

39:53.859 --> 39:55.861
[both screaming]
Danger! Danger!

40:02.033 --> 40:04.703
- Lady!
Lady, are you okay?

40:04.770 --> 40:07.072
Lady, I'm sorry.
Are you hurt?

40:07.138 --> 40:09.074
Are you okay?
Are you--

40:09.140 --> 40:11.943
- You ought to be
ashamed of yourself!

40:12.010 --> 40:13.912
- Jeez, you pack some
heat right there.

40:13.979 --> 40:14.980
Listen, lady, I'm sorry--

40:15.046 --> 40:16.848
- My name is not lady.

40:16.915 --> 40:19.284
My name is Gillie Butler,
and I demand respect!

40:19.350 --> 40:21.386
- Okay, Gillie, sorry.

40:21.453 --> 40:23.121
You came out of nowhere.

40:23.188 --> 40:24.923
You're lucky I didn't
plow you over.

40:24.990 --> 40:26.725
- Find the keys.
Find the keys.

40:26.792 --> 40:27.893
- Yes, milady.

40:27.959 --> 40:29.495
- Intruder detected.

40:29.561 --> 40:30.762
- What is that?

40:30.829 --> 40:33.064
- I have half a mind
to call the police!

40:33.131 --> 40:34.365
- Hey!

40:34.432 --> 40:36.468
All right, let's just
put our purses down

40:36.535 --> 40:38.069
and leave the feds out of it!

40:38.136 --> 40:41.372
- I am Trudy, property of
the gorgeous snowplowman,

40:41.439 --> 40:45.010
who was potty trained at
a perfectly appropriate age.

40:45.076 --> 40:47.746
- I have 13 strong-bodied
sons that wouldn't mind

40:47.813 --> 40:49.347
teaching you a lesson.

40:49.414 --> 40:50.348
- All right--

40:50.415 --> 40:51.650
13 sons?

40:51.717 --> 40:52.818
- Mm-hmm.

40:52.884 --> 40:54.486
- Wait a second, Gillie.
[ahem]

40:54.553 --> 40:56.087
What year were you born?

40:56.154 --> 40:58.023
- Oh, 2008.
- Nah-yea--

40:58.990 --> 41:00.358
- Ow.
- You're a kid.

41:00.425 --> 41:01.860
[honk]

41:02.728 --> 41:04.896
Ah ha, ha, ha!

41:04.963 --> 41:06.765
You looking for these?

41:06.832 --> 41:08.534
- Grab the bird.
- With alacrity, madam.

41:08.600 --> 41:09.901
- Easy, easy.

41:09.968 --> 41:11.670
- Let's go. You're coming
with me. Get over here.

41:11.737 --> 41:12.671
- No.
No.

41:12.738 --> 41:13.872
- Come on.
Come on.

41:13.939 --> 41:15.073
- No.
- You're coming with me.

41:15.140 --> 41:17.142
Yeah, you stupid kids!

41:17.208 --> 41:18.877
You think you can trick me,
you stupid kid?

41:18.944 --> 41:20.411
Get up in there.
Go on.

41:20.478 --> 41:22.614
Get up.
Get up.

41:22.681 --> 41:25.116
Wait, where's my--
where's the--

41:25.183 --> 41:26.117
Trudy.

41:26.184 --> 41:27.352
Trudy!

41:27.418 --> 41:28.554
Where's...

41:28.620 --> 41:34.492
Trudyyyyyyy!

41:38.664 --> 41:39.831
- Hi, Hal.

41:39.898 --> 41:41.099
- Ugh!

41:41.166 --> 41:42.801
You know, someday
I'm gonna surprise you.

41:42.868 --> 41:44.302
- Oh, I'm sure you will.

41:44.369 --> 41:45.904
- Can you say that a
little less patronizing?

41:45.971 --> 41:48.006
- I don't think I can.

41:48.073 --> 41:50.041
- Hey, did you see me
on #Rebeccamendations?

41:50.108 --> 41:51.910
- You definitely
made an impression.

41:51.977 --> 41:55.513
- Then on to step two,
humiliate the boyfriend.

41:55.581 --> 41:57.482
- If you hate him, why did
you draw him so handsome?

41:57.549 --> 41:59.050
- Because he's a gosh
darn snack, Lane.

41:59.117 --> 42:00.952
I can't deny it any longer.
- Yeah.

42:01.019 --> 42:02.788
- Hey, Rebecca Menderson
was cool enough to let me know

42:02.854 --> 42:04.089
where Chuck and Claire
are going.

42:04.155 --> 42:05.156
- And?
- You're going to love it.

42:05.223 --> 42:06.357
- [gasp] It's the
ice skating rink?

42:06.424 --> 42:07.726
- Ding, ding, ding.
- Yes, finally!

42:07.793 --> 42:08.894
- Here we go.
Let's go.

42:08.960 --> 42:10.729
- Wait, Hal, shoes!
- Oh!

42:10.796 --> 42:12.330
Ugh.
- [laughing]

42:12.397 --> 42:14.399
- I'm just--I'm just
making a snow angel.

42:14.465 --> 42:16.067
I did that totally on purpose.
- Uh-huh.

42:16.134 --> 42:18.203
Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

42:22.440 --> 42:24.342
- You know, snow angels
are great and all,

42:24.409 --> 42:27.278
but they kind of
break your heart.

42:27.345 --> 42:28.680
- How come?

42:28.747 --> 42:30.315
- Because it's all perfect,
but then you ruin it

42:30.381 --> 42:33.018
with your handprint
when you get up to look at it.

42:33.084 --> 42:35.220
- Yeah, true.

42:35.286 --> 42:39.324
Hey, why do you love
ice skating so much?

42:40.592 --> 42:42.160
- Honestly?

42:42.227 --> 42:43.494
- Yeah.

42:43.561 --> 42:44.562
- No.

42:44.630 --> 42:45.731
No, you'll think it's dumb.

42:45.797 --> 42:48.634
- No, I won't.

42:48.700 --> 42:49.901
- Okay.

42:50.836 --> 42:52.971
When I'm ice skating...

42:55.406 --> 42:56.507
- What?

42:56.574 --> 42:57.542
- I don't know.

42:57.609 --> 42:59.344
- Lane, it's just me.

43:00.879 --> 43:03.181
- Okay, fine.

43:03.248 --> 43:05.350
When I'm ice skating, I...

43:05.416 --> 43:06.652
[small laugh]

43:06.718 --> 43:10.521
I feel...beautiful.

43:11.790 --> 43:13.058
- Oh, that is dumb.

43:13.124 --> 43:14.592
- See? I told you--

43:14.660 --> 43:18.229
- No, it's dumb because
you're already beautiful.

43:18.296 --> 43:21.266
You're a beautiful girl,
Lane, like factually.

43:22.634 --> 43:24.703
Here, so you don't
ruin your snow angel

43:24.770 --> 43:26.872
with your handprint.

43:26.938 --> 43:28.506
- [grunts]

43:31.042 --> 43:32.210
- Perfect.

43:35.681 --> 43:36.815
[gasps]

43:36.882 --> 43:38.516
- You okay?

43:38.583 --> 43:39.617
- Yeah.

43:39.685 --> 43:42.654
Yeah, yeah, just,
you know, cold.

43:43.321 --> 43:48.026
- Oh, well, I know how
much you love this sweater.

43:48.093 --> 43:50.061
- No, no, no, no,
no, you'll be colder.

43:50.128 --> 43:52.363
Are you crazy?

43:52.430 --> 43:53.665
- Here.

43:53.732 --> 43:55.100
- Thanks.

43:55.166 --> 43:57.302
- Of course, let's go.
- Hal, wait.

43:57.368 --> 43:59.237
- What?

44:01.206 --> 44:02.974
- Did-did you do
something different

44:03.041 --> 44:04.642
with your hair today?

44:04.710 --> 44:07.946
- Oh, no, I can assure you
this mess is whatever it is.

44:08.013 --> 44:09.014
Let's go.

44:09.080 --> 44:10.315
- I'll meet you there.

44:10.381 --> 44:11.783
I just got to call
home real quick.

44:11.850 --> 44:13.551
- Okay.
- Okay.

44:21.092 --> 44:23.261
* Oh, no *

44:23.328 --> 44:25.797
* What's this funny
feeling in my chest? *

44:25.864 --> 44:29.034
* Like I know
there's a different warmth *

44:29.100 --> 44:30.902
* For this than friends *

44:30.969 --> 44:32.637
* Part of me says fight it *

44:32.704 --> 44:35.941
* Part of me secretly
likes that *

44:36.007 --> 44:38.276
* You see my beauty
when I can't *

44:38.343 --> 44:41.980
* Okay, I said it
out loud to myself *

44:42.047 --> 44:43.915
* It doesn't sound so crazy *

44:43.982 --> 44:46.985
* Wait, maybe I can't tell *

44:47.753 --> 44:51.957
* What if I told him
I could be falling? *

44:52.023 --> 44:55.360
* I'm thinking what if,
what if it it's romance? *

44:55.426 --> 44:58.263
* And it's got me wondering *

44:58.329 --> 45:00.231
* How does this song end? *

45:00.298 --> 45:01.833
* I'm thinking what if *

45:01.900 --> 45:05.536
* What if
our story has a twist? *

45:05.603 --> 45:07.372
* *

45:07.438 --> 45:09.340
* Our story has a twist *

45:09.407 --> 45:13.078
* Do I tell him I can't
look at him the same? *

45:13.144 --> 45:14.712
* Yeah, I'll try *

45:14.780 --> 45:17.615
* But suddenly I love
the things I hate *

45:17.682 --> 45:19.584
* Like all these
ugly sweaters *

45:19.650 --> 45:22.821
* I will wear them now
forever *

45:22.888 --> 45:24.722
* Oh, what's happening to me? *

45:24.790 --> 45:28.359
* Okay, I said it
out loud to myself *

45:28.426 --> 45:30.996
* Should I brush it off,
or should I tell him *

45:31.062 --> 45:34.332
* How I really, really feel? *

45:34.399 --> 45:37.936
* What if I told him
I could be falling? *

45:38.003 --> 45:42.507
* I'm thinking what if,
what if it's romance and *

45:42.573 --> 45:46.477
* It's got me wondering
how does this song end? *

45:46.544 --> 45:50.916
* I'm thinking what if,
what if, what if *

45:50.982 --> 45:54.920
* What if I told him
I could be falling? *

45:54.986 --> 45:57.288
* I think I'm falling *

45:57.355 --> 45:59.357
* It's romantic, whoa *

45:59.424 --> 46:03.694
* It's got me wondering,
how does this song end? *

46:03.761 --> 46:05.030
* I'm thinking what if *

46:05.096 --> 46:08.900
* What if
our story has a twist? *

46:08.967 --> 46:13.471
* I could blurt it out
and hope he doesn't laugh *

46:13.538 --> 46:15.306
* Because it would hurt
to have him *

46:15.373 --> 46:17.775
* Write me off like that *

46:17.843 --> 46:20.111
* I wish that
I could jump ahead *

46:20.178 --> 46:22.413
* And read the end *

46:22.480 --> 46:27.385
* 'Cause what if our story
has a twist? *

46:30.721 --> 46:33.558

46:57.916 --> 46:58.816
- Too pancakey.

46:58.884 --> 47:00.551
- Ugh!

47:00.618 --> 47:04.722
- Sheriff Randy,
we have made you 14 pancakes!

47:04.789 --> 47:07.325
- We can't count that first
abomination as a pancake.

47:07.392 --> 47:10.128
- We have made
you 13 pancakes

47:10.195 --> 47:12.730
that are either too dry,
too sweet, too gooey,

47:12.797 --> 47:14.365
or too pancakey.

47:14.432 --> 47:16.201
- People at work
are going to be really mad

47:16.267 --> 47:17.468
at Mommy and Daddy.

47:17.535 --> 47:18.937
- That sounds like
a you problem,

47:19.004 --> 47:20.571
not a me problem.

47:20.638 --> 47:22.240
- Oh, I say it
on one phone call,

47:22.307 --> 47:24.409
and he locks it in.

47:24.475 --> 47:25.476
- Hi, Mom and Dad.
- Natalie, Natalie!

47:25.543 --> 47:26.912
- No time to stop and chat!

47:26.978 --> 47:27.946
- Natalie, sweetie, sweetie!
We got a problem here!

47:28.013 --> 47:29.414
We're handcuffed together!

47:29.480 --> 47:31.016
Randy took those handcuffs,
and we're going crazy.

47:31.082 --> 47:33.118
It's a nightmare.

47:36.387 --> 47:37.688
- We are tickety boo.

47:37.755 --> 47:38.856
- Tickety boo?

47:38.924 --> 47:40.658
- Yes, tickety boo.
- Tickety boo?

47:40.725 --> 47:42.327
We're working here.
English, please.

47:42.393 --> 47:43.494
- It means we're good to go,

47:43.561 --> 47:45.530
and it was actually
quite English.

47:45.596 --> 47:47.698
[electronic chime]
- Whoa!

47:47.765 --> 47:50.068
- [crying]
They took my special bird.

47:50.135 --> 47:51.402
They took Trudy.

47:51.469 --> 47:53.471
[phone ringing]
Don't answer that!

47:53.538 --> 47:54.805
- It could be about Trudy.

47:54.872 --> 47:57.042
- Well, answer it,
for God's sake!

47:57.108 --> 47:58.576
- [sighs]

What's your hassle?

48:00.445 --> 48:02.213
[keyboard clicking]

48:02.280 --> 48:04.849
- Hello, Snowplowman.

48:04.916 --> 48:07.152
- Give me that!

48:07.218 --> 48:09.454
Trudy, baby, I miss you.

48:09.520 --> 48:12.523
- Say, "It's very
difficult being apart."

48:12.590 --> 48:15.961
- It's very difficult,
being a fart.

48:16.027 --> 48:17.095
- [sniggering]

48:17.162 --> 48:18.729
- Eli!
- Apologies.

48:18.796 --> 48:21.632
- Apart.
It's difficult being apart.

48:21.699 --> 48:23.434
- Trudy,
ask them what they want!

48:23.501 --> 48:25.903
I'll give them anything
to get you back.

48:25.971 --> 48:28.239
- Hey, watch the drumsticks!

48:28.306 --> 48:30.075
$1 million.

48:30.141 --> 48:31.409
both: What?

48:31.476 --> 48:32.910
- Worth a shot.

48:32.978 --> 48:34.079
[quirky mysterious music]

48:34.145 --> 48:35.746
- Easy, easy.

48:35.813 --> 48:38.549
Just kidding.
Ha, ha, ha.

48:38.616 --> 48:41.852
Bring the boy to the
center of town in one hour,

48:41.919 --> 48:44.355
or I will tell everyone
that you sleep with dollies!

48:44.422 --> 48:48.093
- [chuckling] Hey, Trudy,
that's private, okay?

48:48.159 --> 48:50.928
- I just made that up.

49:03.008 --> 49:04.209
- Hey.
- Hi.

49:04.275 --> 49:05.876
- Looking good, babe.
- Thanks.

49:05.943 --> 49:07.345
- Hey.
- Hey!

49:07.412 --> 49:09.314
- Oh, nice.
Your friends.

49:09.380 --> 49:10.481
Hey, I should get
to know them better

49:10.548 --> 49:12.350
so I can feel closer to you.

49:12.417 --> 49:13.651
- I appreciate that, Chuck.

49:13.718 --> 49:15.820
- What are their names again?

49:15.886 --> 49:18.056
- Hmm.

49:18.123 --> 49:20.391
Mason, Rebecca, and Missy.

49:20.458 --> 49:22.293
- Oof.
Never going to remember those.

49:22.360 --> 49:23.361
- Hey, you two.

49:23.428 --> 49:24.829
- Hey.
- You two.

49:24.895 --> 49:26.031
all: So...

49:26.097 --> 49:27.898
- Are Claire and Chuck
back together?

49:27.965 --> 49:29.834
- Like back-back?
- Together-together?

49:29.900 --> 49:33.771
- Correction, Claire and
new Chuck are back together.

49:33.838 --> 49:35.940
- Well, new Chuck
is on probation.

49:36.007 --> 49:37.908
- New Chuck does not know
what that word means.

49:37.975 --> 49:39.410
- It means
you better watch your back.

49:39.477 --> 49:41.079
- Watch your back.

49:41.146 --> 49:43.814
- And wash your back even
though it's hard to reach.

49:43.881 --> 49:44.749
- Missy.
- Babe.

49:44.815 --> 49:46.084
- I use a loofah on a stick.

49:46.151 --> 49:47.785
- What are you talking about,
Claire's friends?

49:47.852 --> 49:49.854
- We're talking
about Hal Brandston.

49:49.920 --> 49:51.022
- Guys.

49:51.089 --> 49:52.390
- Who's Hal Brandston?

49:52.457 --> 49:54.525
- Hal Brandston interrupted
my livestream

while I was officially

a light pant
for the transition

49:59.630 --> 50:01.532
from early afternoon
to mid-afternoon.

50:01.599 --> 50:03.101
- Well, I feel like an idiot.

50:03.168 --> 50:05.170
- Oh, Chuck, come on.
I don't even know that guy.

50:05.236 --> 50:06.737
- No, look at me.

50:06.804 --> 50:08.306
I should have gone
with a light pant.

50:08.373 --> 50:10.108
I'm going to go home
and change.

50:10.175 --> 50:12.310
- Chuck!
- Oh, angry voice.

and like an eighth Scotland.

- Yeah.
- I'm on it.

to get Claire some food.

You ready?
- I guess.

Hey, you've already done
the impossible today.

50:34.465 --> 50:35.700

What do you mean?

50:35.766 --> 50:38.169

in the ugly sweater.

50:38.236 --> 50:39.604

50:49.714 --> 50:51.216
- You're Lane from school.

to tell you something--

- Oh, my God, there's a spider
on your shirt!

51:01.259 --> 51:02.527
- What? Where?
I hate spiders!

51:02.593 --> 51:03.728
- Now it's on your hat!

- [screaming]
- Oh, it's on your apron!

51:05.163 --> 51:06.631
Take it off! Take it off!
- No! No! Did I get it?

51:06.697 --> 51:08.333
- Oh, no,
it crawled off your neck!

Run, Dirk, run!

Some of us have
hungry girlfriends.

Sorry for the delay, folks.

- Hey there.
- Hey, uh, Dirk.

51:27.718 --> 51:30.087
- It's a family name.
- Oh.

51:30.155 --> 51:32.323
So what do girls, like, eat?

51:32.390 --> 51:33.891
- Hmm, what do girls,
like, eat?

51:33.958 --> 51:36.827
Mm, you know,
girls are complicated.

51:36.894 --> 51:38.028
- Right?

51:38.095 --> 51:39.497
- You know what
you can't go wrong with?

51:39.564 --> 51:41.499
- What?
- A burger with pickles.

51:41.566 --> 51:42.567
- Pickles?

51:42.633 --> 51:45.836
- She is going to love it.

51:45.903 --> 51:48.606
- You're going to love it.
- Oh, I'm starving.

51:48.673 --> 51:51.242
What'd you get me?
- Just trust.

51:51.309 --> 51:52.910
- Okay.

51:53.844 --> 51:55.480
Mm, mm.

51:59.517 --> 52:00.551
Does this have pickles?

52:00.618 --> 52:01.686
- Extra pickles.

52:01.752 --> 52:04.922
- [gagging and spitting]

52:04.989 --> 52:06.191
I hate pickles.

52:06.257 --> 52:09.160
I've told you this
like a million times.

52:09.227 --> 52:11.562
- Dirk.
- Who's Dirk?

52:11.629 --> 52:13.631
- She's the cute girl
who works at the food truck.

52:13.698 --> 52:15.666
- Cute girl?
- Yeah.

52:15.733 --> 52:17.768
- Okay, that's it.
We're done.

52:17.835 --> 52:19.904
- Wait, Claire.
- Like for real this time.

52:19.970 --> 52:21.572
- Claire, come on.

52:21.639 --> 52:25.676
Claire, you're so much cuter
than her.

52:25.743 --> 52:27.077
- Ugh!
- Are you okay?

52:27.144 --> 52:29.079
- What happened?
- Where's Chuck going?

52:31.882 --> 52:33.150
- Whoo!

52:33.218 --> 52:35.686
Okay, so I think step two
went off without a hitch.

52:35.753 --> 52:37.422
- Oh, hi!
- [laughs]

52:37.488 --> 52:39.690
- You are amazing!
- [laughs]

52:39.757 --> 52:42.026
- [sighs]
Okay.

52:42.092 --> 52:44.862
Time for step three,
the grand gesture.

52:44.929 --> 52:46.431
This step requires
actually talking to her,

52:46.497 --> 52:48.533
so excuse me while I panic.

52:48.599 --> 52:50.601
- Hal, you know you don't have
to do this much

52:50.668 --> 52:52.069
for a girl to like you.
- Yes, I do.

52:52.136 --> 52:56.173
- Trust me, you don't.
Regular Hal isn't so bad.

52:56.241 --> 53:00.545
I mean, sure, you're a little
awkward, but you're also--

53:00.611 --> 53:03.581
[soft dramatic music]

53:03.648 --> 53:04.749
Do you remember
in second grade,

53:04.815 --> 53:06.784
we went on the field trip
to the zoo?

53:06.851 --> 53:08.953
- Oh, the whooping cranes.
- [laughs] Yes!

53:09.019 --> 53:11.789
I was so irrationally scared
and started freaking out,

53:11.856 --> 53:13.824
but before the other kids
could make fun of me,

53:13.891 --> 53:15.993
you started saying,
"Whoop, whoop! I'm a crane!

53:16.060 --> 53:18.162
Whoop, whoop!"
over and over.

53:18.229 --> 53:19.697
- That was so embarrassing.

53:19.764 --> 53:21.399
- So embarrassing.
[laughs]

53:21.466 --> 53:27.104
But it distracted everyone
from me and also distracted me.

53:27.171 --> 53:29.474
You were my hero.

53:29.540 --> 53:35.380
Point is, you were enough then,
and you're enough now.

53:35.446 --> 53:38.649

53:38.716 --> 53:40.951
- Hey, Claire.

53:42.887 --> 53:45.890
Meet me at the soccer field
in an hour?

53:45.956 --> 53:46.824
- Should I?

53:46.891 --> 53:48.293
- I mean, he's kind of cute.

53:48.359 --> 53:49.727
- And it would be a great way
to get back at Chuck.

53:49.794 --> 53:51.996
- [chuckling]
Chuck is so hot.

53:52.062 --> 53:53.598
- Missy, think before you talk.

53:53.664 --> 53:54.599
- Babe, you need
to get with the program.

53:54.665 --> 53:56.701
- Okay!
- [sighs] Yes!

53:56.767 --> 53:57.735
Oh, God, it's happening.

53:57.802 --> 54:01.772
- Oh, shoes! Okay, lift.
Who am I?

54:01.839 --> 54:05.276
- You're my hero.
Like, for real.

54:16.954 --> 54:19.223
- Oh, yes.

54:19.290 --> 54:20.291
Good call, babe.
- [laughs]

54:20.358 --> 54:21.459
- Very smart.
- Thank you.

54:21.526 --> 54:23.093
- Yeah.
Okay, here we go.

54:23.160 --> 54:25.763
- Okay.
- Three, two, one...

54:25.830 --> 54:27.465

- 'Ey!

54:27.532 --> 54:30.000
- Pretty good.
That's really good.

54:32.337 --> 54:35.406
- Hey.

54:35.473 --> 54:37.475
I've missed you.

54:37.542 --> 54:39.744
- I've missed you, too.

54:39.810 --> 54:42.813
- Do my ears detect nostalgia?

54:42.880 --> 54:45.483
- Sorry, Johnny Depp-uty.

54:45.550 --> 54:46.917
[both groan softly]

54:46.984 --> 54:48.152
You know what I think we need?

54:48.218 --> 54:50.621
- No, three kids is enough.
- [laughs]

54:50.688 --> 54:55.693
I'm thinking we need
a little powdered sugar.

54:55.760 --> 54:57.294
- Oh, you want to go
with the powdered sugar?

54:57.362 --> 54:58.563
- Mm-hmm.

54:58.629 --> 55:00.931
- Okay, how about
there, there, there?

55:00.998 --> 55:02.633
No, see, this is how it starts.

55:02.700 --> 55:04.201
We're going to get
ourselves into trouble.

55:04.268 --> 55:05.870
- Johnny Depp-uty.

55:05.936 --> 55:09.474
- Here we go.
Your pancakes, sir.

perfectly pancakey!

55:29.727 --> 55:31.896
- Ah, yes, yes!
- Oh!

55:31.962 --> 55:34.932
- That's great news.
Can you please uncuff us now?

55:34.999 --> 55:37.201
- First, you gotta catch me!

55:37.267 --> 55:38.403
- Oh!

55:38.469 --> 55:40.505
- Randy!
- Randy!

55:40.571 --> 55:41.739
- Randy.

I'm hit!

55:45.075 --> 55:47.111
[groaning]

55:47.177 --> 55:48.813
- Don't you die on me, soldier!

- Oh!
- [chuckles]

57:27.044 --> 57:30.280
[tense music fading]

57:30.347 --> 57:31.448
- Give me my bird.

57:31.516 --> 57:32.750
- I'll give you your bird

57:32.817 --> 57:34.652
if you promise to stop plowing.

57:34.719 --> 57:36.386
- Not a chance.

Don't, don't.

What--how? Don't you--
[wailing unintelligibly]

57:42.226 --> 57:44.995
Why would you hurt her?
She's done nothing!

57:45.062 --> 57:47.064
- Psst, Wayne.
Wayne, my boy.

57:47.131 --> 57:48.365
Here.

57:48.432 --> 57:49.600
- What are these for?

57:49.667 --> 57:51.135
- You're going to cut off
the accelerator

57:51.201 --> 57:54.038
so the snowplow can't move.

57:54.104 --> 57:55.673
- He'll be totally stuck here.

- Precisely.
- Oh!

You're smarter than you look.

- Give me my bird, or you'll
never see your friend again.

58:05.550 --> 58:06.717
He'll live with me,

58:06.784 --> 58:09.086
and I'll make him
trim my mom's toenails!

58:09.153 --> 58:10.354
- Ew.

58:10.420 --> 58:11.822

It's gross!

58:11.889 --> 58:13.558
[upbeat suspenseful music]

58:13.624 --> 58:15.359
- You know what, Snowplowman?

58:15.425 --> 58:18.062
I'm an adorable
and precocious young lady

58:18.128 --> 58:20.297
with my whole life ahead of me.

58:20.364 --> 58:23.834
You, well, you're just
an ugly mug with mommy issues

58:23.901 --> 58:25.603
who's in love with a toy bird.

58:25.670 --> 58:27.237
- She has a name!

- Look, I'll let you win today
because I know I win at life.

from my queen!

your filthy hands off her!

Come on, let's go!

Here you go, baby.

you three ragamuffins watch

dreams of a second snow day.

Trudy, start the engine.

59:09.179 --> 59:11.015
- Starting engine.

59:44.348 --> 59:49.720
Claire, I--I have spent
half my life pining for you.

59:49.787 --> 59:51.622
Isn't that ridiculous?

59:51.689 --> 59:54.491
I mean, if you feel something
wonderful for someone,

59:54.558 --> 59:56.593
shouldn't you tell them?

59:56.661 --> 1:00:01.165
So here I am, not just
telling you, but showing you.

1:00:01.231 --> 1:00:02.432
This is my grand gesture.

1:00:02.499 --> 1:00:06.737

- When I looked up this
Hal Brandston clown

1:00:49.346 --> 1:00:51.048
in the yearbook, he's never
even been on a sports team,

1:00:51.115 --> 1:00:52.649
like not even a fake sport
like golf.

1:00:52.717 --> 1:00:53.818
- Now hold on a second.

1:00:53.884 --> 1:00:55.219

I'm Chuck Wheeler,

without brakes before?

1:01:22.479 --> 1:01:23.513
- No!

1:01:23.580 --> 1:01:24.882
- Well, can you
drive any slower?

- [high-pitched
No!

1:01:26.350 --> 1:01:27.818
- Well, how much longer
until the gas runs out?

1:01:27.885 --> 1:01:29.586
- [normally] Oh, about two
hours unless we hit a building

1:01:29.653 --> 1:01:32.522

you won't stop distracting me!

you cut the brakes.

- I can't believe
you said no to sinkholes!

puffy grandma coat

- Math.

- Fine!
Question, though.

1:02:22.439 --> 1:02:23.941
Do you want to be the guy
that cut the wrong wire

1:02:24.008 --> 1:02:26.777
or the guy that saved the day?

1:02:26.844 --> 1:02:28.846

1:03:36.914 --> 1:03:38.182
- Oh, man, Lane.

1:03:38.248 --> 1:03:39.383
I just pushed Chuck
into a whale,

1:03:39.449 --> 1:03:40.750
and then I stole
his snowmobile--

1:03:40.817 --> 1:03:44.521
- Stop talking, okay?

1:03:44.588 --> 1:03:48.358
You secretly pined after
someone for a long time.

1:03:48.425 --> 1:03:50.760
And today,
instead of keeping it in,

1:03:50.827 --> 1:03:53.063
you went after it
with a grand gesture.

1:03:53.130 --> 1:03:57.968
You were bold because
it's a snow day.

1:03:58.035 --> 1:04:00.737
[soft dramatic music]

1:04:00.804 --> 1:04:01.738
* *

1:04:01.805 --> 1:04:03.707
There.

1:04:03.773 --> 1:04:07.377
There's my grand gesture.

1:04:07.444 --> 1:04:08.445
- Wait, wait, you--

1:04:08.512 --> 1:04:09.980
- Look, look, look, look.

1:04:10.047 --> 1:04:11.615
I'm going ice skating.

1:04:11.681 --> 1:04:14.251
If I see you there
before the rink closes, great.

1:04:14.318 --> 1:04:17.354
And if I don't,
then I promise that tomorrow

1:04:17.421 --> 1:04:20.090
is a new, normal day.

1:04:20.157 --> 1:04:22.792
Everything resets, right?

1:04:22.859 --> 1:04:25.963
And you'll just be my--

1:04:26.030 --> 1:04:29.066
my pal, Hal,
whose shoes I tie

1:04:29.133 --> 1:04:33.803
and who I kissed once
on a snow day.

1:04:33.870 --> 1:04:40.810
* *

1:04:48.618 --> 1:04:51.321
- Hey.
- [gasps] Oh.

1:04:51.388 --> 1:04:53.423
[both chuckle]

1:04:53.490 --> 1:04:55.825
You surprised me.
[laughs]

1:04:55.892 --> 1:04:58.462
- Well, that's a first.

1:04:58.528 --> 1:05:01.065
- Do you want to sit?

1:05:01.131 --> 1:05:03.333
- Sure.

1:05:12.142 --> 1:05:14.244
[both chuckle]

1:05:17.314 --> 1:05:20.650
Hey, uh, want some?

1:05:20.717 --> 1:05:23.387
- You eat candy corn
when you're nervous, too?

1:05:23.453 --> 1:05:25.489
- No, but I know you do,

1:05:25.555 --> 1:05:27.424
so I always kept a pack on me

1:05:27.491 --> 1:05:29.826
in case I ever got the chance
to offer you some.

1:05:29.893 --> 1:05:31.095
- Wow.

1:05:31.161 --> 1:05:32.629
- Yeah, challenging
to find year-round,

1:05:32.696 --> 1:05:35.632
but I figured out a system
and--

1:05:40.037 --> 1:05:41.805
[both chuckle]

1:05:41.871 --> 1:05:45.742
- Oh. Man.

1:05:45.809 --> 1:05:47.111
Wow, if I thought
I was going to get kissed

1:05:47.177 --> 1:05:48.578
by two beautiful women today,

1:05:48.645 --> 1:05:51.115
I would have worn
a better shirt.

1:05:51.181 --> 1:05:55.052
- Two beautiful women?

1:05:55.119 --> 1:05:57.754
- Oh, why did I say that
out loud?

1:05:57.821 --> 1:05:59.356
I have this friend--

1:05:59.423 --> 1:06:01.825
- Lane?
- How did you know?

1:06:01.891 --> 1:06:04.128
- Because I'm a girl.
[both chuckle]

1:06:04.194 --> 1:06:06.563
- Right, man, girls are
so much smarter than guys.

1:06:06.630 --> 1:06:07.431
- Yes.

1:06:07.497 --> 1:06:09.766
[both chuckle]

1:06:09.833 --> 1:06:13.137
- Anyways, uh...

1:06:13.203 --> 1:06:15.905
she kissed me.

1:06:15.972 --> 1:06:19.876
And even though I never thought
about her in that way before,

1:06:19.943 --> 1:06:24.581
now I kind of can't stop
thinking about her in that way.

1:06:24.648 --> 1:06:27.584
And Lane knows me,
like, regular, old me,

1:06:27.651 --> 1:06:31.455
and somehow,
she still likes me.

1:06:31.521 --> 1:06:34.424
[soft dramatic music]

1:06:34.491 --> 1:06:35.959
* *

1:06:36.026 --> 1:06:39.396
- Is it because she has
a longer neck than me?

1:06:39.463 --> 1:06:42.032
- Oh, Claire, no,
your neck isn't short, okay?

1:06:42.099 --> 1:06:44.834
And even if it was, no guy
in the history of the planet

1:06:44.901 --> 1:06:47.337
has ever rejected a girl
because of her neck length.

1:06:47.404 --> 1:06:50.474
* *

1:06:50.540 --> 1:06:54.444
- Thank you.
[chuckles]

1:06:54.511 --> 1:06:57.314
- Oh, man, what time does
the skating rink close?

1:06:57.381 --> 1:06:59.849
- 5:00.
- Oh, I got to run.

1:06:59.916 --> 1:07:02.519
- Oh, your shoe's untied.

1:07:02.586 --> 1:07:03.487
[quirky upbeat music]

1:07:03.553 --> 1:07:06.056
Yep, definitely untied.

1:07:06.123 --> 1:07:09.226
- Oh, sorry, sorry.
Lane, she ties my shoes for me.

1:07:09.293 --> 1:07:11.061
- Why?
[chuckles]

1:07:11.128 --> 1:07:13.130
* *

1:07:13.197 --> 1:07:15.899
- She's my hero.

1:07:15.965 --> 1:07:17.267
[chuckles]

1:07:17.334 --> 1:07:20.470

1:07:20.537 --> 1:07:25.175
* *

1:07:25.242 --> 1:07:26.443
- Yes, sir!

1:07:26.510 --> 1:07:27.544
Folks, this is the last song

1:07:27.611 --> 1:07:28.712
before the rink
goes night-night.

1:07:28.778 --> 1:07:30.080
And you know what that means?

1:07:30.147 --> 1:07:32.982
That's right,
it's the couples-only skate.

1:07:33.049 --> 1:07:37.787
So you got to grab that special
someone or get off the ice.

1:07:37.854 --> 1:07:42.892
[u

1:07:42.959 --> 1:07:44.794
Hey, lady with
the ugly sweaters.

1:07:44.861 --> 1:07:47.864
If you ain't got a
special someone, get off--

1:07:47.931 --> 1:07:49.266
- I heard you!

1:07:49.333 --> 1:07:51.000
- * If you've never felt
déjà vu *

1:07:51.067 --> 1:07:54.738
- You know, you really do
look beautiful when you skate.

1:07:54.804 --> 1:07:58.442
- * It's like I've known you
all my life *

1:07:58.508 --> 1:08:00.244
- [chuckles softly]

1:08:00.310 --> 1:08:03.947
- * You were right
in front of my face *

1:08:04.013 --> 1:08:06.616
* And I know that
it was meant to be *

1:08:06.683 --> 1:08:08.652
- You're here.
- Yeah.

1:08:08.718 --> 1:08:11.221
- I didn't think
you would come.

1:08:11.288 --> 1:08:14.524
- So I finally surprised you?

1:08:14.591 --> 1:08:15.692
- I guess so.

1:08:15.759 --> 1:08:18.428
- * And you're my girl *

1:08:18.495 --> 1:08:19.929
- Well, let me
surprise you again.

1:08:19.996 --> 1:08:23.500
* *

1:08:23.567 --> 1:08:26.870
- May I have your attention,
please?

1:08:26.935 --> 1:08:28.572
Thank you.
[clears throat]

1:08:28.638 --> 1:08:31.475
I have just gotten word
that thanks to Eli Welch,

1:08:31.541 --> 1:08:34.444
Wayne Castle, and your girl,
Natalie Brandston,

1:08:34.511 --> 1:08:36.580
roads will not be plowed,

1:08:36.645 --> 1:08:39.349
so there's gonna be
a second snow day!

1:08:39.416 --> 1:08:42.185
[cheers and applause]

1:08:42.252 --> 1:08:43.953
- She did it.

1:08:44.020 --> 1:08:45.221
- Free tomorrow?

1:08:45.288 --> 1:08:46.890
- Tomorrow. Uh...

1:08:46.956 --> 1:08:48.758
tomorrow I promised I
would spend with my sister,

1:08:48.825 --> 1:08:52.095
but what are your plans
for every day after that?

1:08:52.162 --> 1:08:54.029

* If I knew then
what I know now *

1:09:07.877 --> 1:09:09.412
* I would have
made you my lady *

1:09:09.479 --> 1:09:11.747
* Picked you up, now, I'm
never going to put you down *

1:09:11.814 --> 1:09:13.950

getting started *

1:09:14.017 --> 1:09:16.286

1:09:16.353 --> 1:09:17.953
* Finally opened my heart *

1:09:18.020 --> 1:09:20.023

beating for your love *

to stick it to the man *
