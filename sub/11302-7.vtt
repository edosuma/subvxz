WEBVTT

00:07.800 --> 00:09.217
Damn it.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.428
Boots are all dirty.

00:12.345 --> 00:13.889
Now what am I gonna wear out?

00:15.265 --> 00:17.267
Well, that's what you
get for only having one pair.

00:18.185 --> 00:20.020
You always need four
pairs of boots, Colt.

00:21.063 --> 00:22.105
One pair of working boots,

00:22.189 --> 00:25.567
one pair of drinking boots,
two pair for knocking boots.

00:27.861 --> 00:30.448
The only reason you'd
need two pair of knocking boots

00:30.531 --> 00:33.117
is if you're doing
it outside on all fours.

00:37.830 --> 00:38.831
No, man.

00:38.914 --> 00:40.624
You need 'em for when you
gotta jump out of the window

00:40.708 --> 00:41.917
and leave a pair behind.

00:43.627 --> 00:44.837
If you think you might get caught,

00:44.920 --> 00:46.274
why don't you just leave the first pair

00:46.299 --> 00:47.419
of boots outside the window?

00:50.133 --> 00:51.653
Damn, Colt, you just changed the game.

00:54.429 --> 00:57.015
Man, Dad was being a
real hard-ass today, huh?

00:57.099 --> 00:58.100
Yep.

00:58.183 --> 01:00.435
I heard him utter every
curse word known to man,

01:00.518 --> 01:02.855
but I ain't never heard him take
John Deere's name in vain.

01:05.397 --> 01:07.109
He's just pissed 'cause
Mom didn't wanna move in.

01:07.192 --> 01:08.649
I haven't seen him that mad since

01:08.674 --> 01:10.302
Obama released his birth certificate.

01:14.992 --> 01:17.703
Wait, what the hell's the
deal with Mom and Dad, man?

01:17.786 --> 01:20.205
I... You know, they seem
like they're getting along so well.

01:20.288 --> 01:22.249
Yeah, I've seen this over and over.

01:22.332 --> 01:24.584
Mom and Dad are like Brooks
& Dunn, you know?

01:24.668 --> 01:26.003
They get back together every few years,

01:26.086 --> 01:28.797
and every time they do, it
just gets worse and worse.

01:31.174 --> 01:32.885
- Oh, hey, Dad.
- Hey, Pop.

01:32.968 --> 01:35.137
How far did you get with the fence?

01:35.220 --> 01:37.180
Uh, we got to the west creek.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.099
Both of you,

01:39.182 --> 01:42.019
all day, got to the west creek?

01:43.436 --> 01:44.938
There any chance you're saying that

01:44.963 --> 01:46.338
'cause you're just so impressed?

01:48.066 --> 01:49.777
Closed the gate on the way out?

01:51.569 --> 01:52.570
Yeah.

01:54.406 --> 01:56.824
Yeah, we closed it.
I remember it, 'cause I said,

01:56.909 --> 01:58.201
"It's awfully windy out,

01:58.285 --> 02:00.287
make sure that gate's
closed tight, Rooster."

02:00.954 --> 02:02.497
Oh, yeah, that's right.

02:02.580 --> 02:03.861
And then I closed it and I said,

02:03.874 --> 02:06.251
"Hey, Colt, make sure
you go lock that gate."

02:07.628 --> 02:08.670
And then you said to me,

02:08.753 --> 02:09.896
"Oh, man, I'm Colt Bennett.

02:09.922 --> 02:11.530
I don't gotta make sure of nothing."

02:12.340 --> 02:13.341
And then you were like,

02:13.425 --> 02:15.302
"Man, Dad's a real jerk, ain't he?"

02:16.553 --> 02:17.595
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

02:17.680 --> 02:20.683
And then I said, "Just kidding.

02:22.225 --> 02:24.102
'Cause Dad is not only my father,

02:24.186 --> 02:25.353
he's my best friend."

02:27.147 --> 02:28.588
But, Dad, you know what, I'm gonna go

02:28.609 --> 02:30.049
check on that gate on Colt's behalf.

02:30.067 --> 02:31.484
Oh, no.

02:32.402 --> 02:33.403
You boys relax.

02:33.486 --> 02:35.030
You've had a long day.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.281
I'll go check on it.

02:37.199 --> 02:38.163
And when I get back,

02:38.188 --> 02:40.309
I'll give each of
you a nice foot massage.

02:43.246 --> 02:44.832
I know he's kidding...

02:44.915 --> 02:47.292
but I bet them strong
hands could work wonders.

02:50.670 --> 02:51.880
Where are you goin'?

02:51.964 --> 02:53.256
Go help Dad.

02:53.340 --> 02:54.313
You might wanna leave

02:54.338 --> 02:56.283
an extra pair of boots outside the barn.

03:00.638 --> 03:02.682
Yeah, I'll come help.

03:02.766 --> 03:04.893
Son of a bitch!

03:04.977 --> 03:05.947
I've missed 15 years,

03:05.972 --> 03:08.004
I can miss one more night.

04:15.130 --> 04:17.800
- Hey, Hank. Mom.
- Colt.

04:17.882 --> 04:18.884
Hey.

04:18.966 --> 04:20.677
How's, uh, life in the Airstream?

04:20.761 --> 04:22.387
Oh, it's good.

04:22.470 --> 04:24.681
Though, ever since I heard what
you and Heather did in there,

04:24.765 --> 04:27.017
I haven't been able to
eat off my kitchen table.

04:29.686 --> 04:30.446
If that's the case,

04:30.451 --> 04:32.046
you might not want to eat off this bar.

04:35.192 --> 04:37.110
Seriously though, you doing okay?

04:37.694 --> 04:39.112
Yeah, I'm good.

04:39.196 --> 04:40.676
I'm more concerned about your father.

04:40.697 --> 04:41.782
How's he holding up?

04:41.865 --> 04:44.701
Today he told me I
make terrible coffee...

04:45.618 --> 04:47.370
told me I can't bale hay for shit...

04:48.705 --> 04:50.756
then he went on a one-hour
rant about how

04:50.781 --> 04:52.733
they don't make dirt like they used to.

04:56.171 --> 04:58.715
Look, I'm sorry if what's
going on with your father and I

04:58.799 --> 05:00.633
has made life harder for you.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.510
Hey, who am I to be mad?

05:02.594 --> 05:04.721
You came home, stirred
shit up, and left.

05:04.805 --> 05:05.697
That's a move right out

05:05.721 --> 05:07.348
of the Colt Bennett Playbook.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.685
- Hey, Colt.
- Mmm. Hey, Ab.

05:10.768 --> 05:11.769
Hey, Mrs. Bennett.

05:11.854 --> 05:13.271
Hey, darlin'.

05:13.355 --> 05:14.564
I got you a little
something for your trailer.

05:14.647 --> 05:16.358
Kind of a re-housewarming gift.

05:16.441 --> 05:17.484
Oh.

05:17.567 --> 05:18.693
Really?

05:18.776 --> 05:21.176
I think I warmed it up pretty
good with that fire.

05:22.739 --> 05:24.449
I got it, it's too soon. I'm sorry.

05:25.450 --> 05:26.994
Well, isn't that sweet.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.371
And it's sharp and spiky.

05:30.288 --> 05:32.165
I think I'll put it on my kitchen table.

05:33.959 --> 05:36.086
You just love gifts, don't you?

05:36.169 --> 05:37.210
What're you talking about?

05:37.254 --> 05:39.882
You give my mom a housewarming gift,

05:39.965 --> 05:41.091
you tell me to get Heather a gift,

05:41.174 --> 05:43.635
which gifted me the
greatest gift of all...

05:43.718 --> 05:44.970
a girlfriend.

05:46.263 --> 05:48.556
Aw, that's cute.

05:48.640 --> 05:49.410
You guys gonna hold hands

05:49.435 --> 05:50.666
when you pick her up from junior high?

05:53.020 --> 05:54.785
I ain't dating someone from junior high.

05:54.809 --> 05:55.712
She's kidding, Hank.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.232
I'm not here to judge.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.000
I'm telling you,
things were going great.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.588
Now she's in my phone as "Heather"

06:02.613 --> 06:03.637
with two heart emojis.

06:04.322 --> 06:06.699
She used to be in my phone as "Hannah?"

06:08.743 --> 06:09.869
Colt, when is the last time

06:09.895 --> 06:11.312
you were in a real relationship?

06:11.371 --> 06:12.539
Oh, you know what,

06:12.622 --> 06:14.487
I was in a serious relationship

06:14.513 --> 06:16.317
with this girl named Jessie.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.170
- Oh.
- And on our first anniversary,

06:18.253 --> 06:19.712
her husband walked in on us.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.800
Should have left a pair of
boots outside the window.

06:25.510 --> 06:26.511
What?

06:27.262 --> 06:28.847
Ah... Nothing.

06:30.598 --> 06:32.892
I guess, uh, you set the
bar pretty high, girl.

06:32.976 --> 06:35.603
Well, that's very
sweet. It's also very true.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.856
I was your last serious girlfriend?

06:40.400 --> 06:41.826
Well, who are you to be giving

06:41.851 --> 06:42.801
relationship advice anyway?

06:42.860 --> 06:43.986
You only been with Kenny.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.864
No! I dated lots of people.

06:46.949 --> 06:48.283
I went out with Steve Williger.

06:48.366 --> 06:51.828
- You... Steve Williger?
- What? Yeah.

06:51.911 --> 06:54.247
That guy wore a Star Wars
T-shirt every single day!

06:55.873 --> 06:58.114
"Fashion
sense, I have none."

06:59.627 --> 07:02.422
All right, you can keep going,
dating a cavalcade of women, or...

07:02.505 --> 07:04.382
- Stop.
- It means a parade.

07:04.466 --> 07:05.508
Thank you.

07:07.052 --> 07:09.007
Or you could commit to a relationship

07:09.032 --> 07:11.038
and see what it's like to be an adult.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.975
All right, so, you're telling me

07:13.058 --> 07:14.935
that you think I
should commit to a woman

07:15.018 --> 07:16.578
that you think I'm immature for dating?

07:16.644 --> 07:18.813
I'm not talking
about Heather specifically.

07:18.896 --> 07:21.691
I'm talking about the fact that
you're a 34-year-old man

07:21.774 --> 07:24.694
who hasn't had a serious
girlfriend since he was 18.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.448
Yeah.

07:29.366 --> 07:31.493
You know what? You're
right. I need to grow up.

07:32.410 --> 07:34.621
I'm gonna text Heather to tell
her that I'm gonna break up with her.

07:34.704 --> 07:38.625
Oh, my God! No, you cannot
break up with her over text.

07:39.751 --> 07:41.503
True, true, that could get messy.

07:41.586 --> 07:43.299
I'll just wait for her to text me

07:43.324 --> 07:45.489
and then write back,
"New phone. Who dis?"

07:51.679 --> 07:52.680
All right.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.642
If you insist on doing it this way,

07:55.725 --> 07:56.891
at least let me write the text

07:56.917 --> 07:58.486
so you don't seem like a total asshole.

08:00.147 --> 08:03.066
Well, that seems like the
easy way out. Here you go.

08:04.442 --> 08:07.029
But make sure you misspell some
words so she believes it's me.

08:07.654 --> 08:10.448
- "Heather, it's been great seeing you..."
- Oh, oh,

08:10.532 --> 08:12.659
spell "great" G-R-8.

08:14.244 --> 08:17.455
"But now is
not a good time for me."

08:17.539 --> 08:19.374
- Yeah.
- "You're a real special girl

08:19.457 --> 08:21.543
and I know you'll find someone great."

08:22.252 --> 08:25.005
- G-R-8.
- G-R-8, yeah. I got it. Gotcha.

08:26.798 --> 08:28.466
- Okay.
- Yeah.

08:28.550 --> 08:29.926
That's perfect.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.636
I should let you break
up with all my girlfriends.

08:31.719 --> 08:33.554
- Send that.
- Yep.

08:34.472 --> 08:36.183
- Bingo.
- Yes!

08:37.100 --> 08:38.644
"Heather, I'm coming over.

08:38.726 --> 08:40.102
There's something I need
to tell you in person."

08:40.187 --> 08:41.604
Oh, what the hell?

08:42.938 --> 08:44.148
Welcome to adulthood.

08:45.461 --> 08:46.777
Where are you
going? Hey, come back here!

08:46.859 --> 08:48.235
New phone. Who dis?

08:54.534 --> 08:57.162
Thanks for coming on
such short notice, Dale.

08:57.662 --> 08:58.663
Good to see you.

08:58.746 --> 09:00.790
It's never good to see me, Beau.

09:00.873 --> 09:03.085
The last three times,
it was a cow in labor,

09:03.168 --> 09:06.463
a bull insemination, and
Carol Palmer's wedding.

09:06.546 --> 09:10.550
All of which took three
hours longer than they should have.

09:11.759 --> 09:13.345
Hey, Doc, how's your daughter doin'?

09:13.428 --> 09:16.306
As far as you're
concerned, she's a lesbian.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.728
She sure wasn't in high school.

09:26.149 --> 09:28.443
So, what's going on with the calf, Dale?

09:29.861 --> 09:31.654
Damn it, Dale, I said

09:31.680 --> 09:33.472
what's going on with the calf?

09:33.531 --> 09:35.950
Why are you shouting at me?

09:37.535 --> 09:39.954
Because you need a hearing aid, old man.

09:40.037 --> 09:42.874
I do not need a hearing aid.

09:42.957 --> 09:46.128
You need to stop mumbling, Grandpa.

09:46.919 --> 09:48.338
I don't mumble.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.965
Telling me I mumble...

09:52.967 --> 09:54.469
Yeah, yeah, you're both old.

09:55.845 --> 09:58.681
So, uh, Doc, what do you
think's going on with this calf?

09:58.765 --> 10:01.809
Well, looks like a bacteria infection.

10:02.727 --> 10:05.438
Probably brought on by
drinking standing water.

10:05.522 --> 10:07.982
- Son of a bitch.
- Are we gonna lose him?

10:08.065 --> 10:09.734
Not necessarily.

10:10.693 --> 10:13.780
You'll know in 24
hours, one way or the other.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.573
What're our options?

10:17.242 --> 10:18.573
For the love of God!

10:18.598 --> 10:20.186
What are our options, you old coot?

10:20.245 --> 10:22.196
Our options are that you adopt

10:22.220 --> 10:24.690
a civil tone with me or I'm leaving!

10:25.917 --> 10:27.794
You're right. I'm sorry.

10:28.711 --> 10:29.712
Jackass.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.005
Jackass?

10:31.088 --> 10:32.381
Oh, that you can hear!

10:35.260 --> 10:37.543
Well, the best thing you can do

10:37.567 --> 10:39.621
for this calf is to start him on...

10:39.681 --> 10:41.849
a series of antibiotics.

10:41.933 --> 10:44.227
But that's gonna cost you money...

10:44.311 --> 10:46.896
and I know you for
being a cheap bastard.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.442
How much you gonna gouge me?

10:50.525 --> 10:53.486
Oh, the whole series will
be about, uh, 250.

10:53.570 --> 10:56.108
250? What, are you taking Charlene

10:56.133 --> 10:58.307
to Rome for your anniversary?

10:58.366 --> 11:00.160
Can you guarantee it's gonna work?

11:00.243 --> 11:02.787
You know the answer
to that as well as I do.

11:02.870 --> 11:04.622
It may work, it may not.

11:05.122 --> 11:07.750
"May." Always hated that word.

11:07.834 --> 11:10.086
It's only when my
birthday is, but whatever.

11:11.754 --> 11:15.174
Well, the shots are
cheaper than losing the calf.

11:15.258 --> 11:16.884
Especially this close to market.

11:16.968 --> 11:18.428
Not if we're gonna lose him anyway.

11:18.511 --> 11:21.180
Then we're down 250, plus
1,200 for the calf.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.809
So, what's your professional opinion?

11:24.892 --> 11:28.020
Well, if it was up to
me, I'd give the calf shots.

11:28.104 --> 11:31.148
Of course you would. You
get paid to give shots.

11:31.233 --> 11:35.570
You know, I got kicked in the
chest by a mule this morning

11:35.653 --> 11:38.072
and that visit was
pleasanter than this one.

11:40.325 --> 11:42.159
What's it gonna be, Beau?

11:43.160 --> 11:45.455
Look, Dad, if there's no
guarantee it's gonna work,

11:45.538 --> 11:47.098
we should save the money and not do it.

11:47.164 --> 11:49.125
Rooster, nobody asked you.

11:49.208 --> 11:50.627
We're not gonna do it!

11:51.794 --> 11:53.796
Suit yourself. You know the drill.

11:53.880 --> 11:57.091
Push the fluids. Electrolytes,
if you got 'em.

11:57.842 --> 11:59.093
Thanks, Dale.

12:00.512 --> 12:02.805
If you need me, you can
call, I'll be in the neighborhood.

12:02.889 --> 12:05.141
I'm stopping over at the Anderson ranch.

12:05.224 --> 12:08.144
That old man is a bigger
pain in the ass than you are.

12:09.103 --> 12:11.481
I wish that mule had kicked you harder.

12:11.564 --> 12:12.815
What?

12:12.899 --> 12:15.026
Damn it. Get your ears fixed, old man!

12:15.109 --> 12:17.362
I can't even insult you anymore!

12:18.530 --> 12:20.365
Hey, Doc, before you leave, um...

12:21.366 --> 12:22.575
you check out a rash?

12:23.660 --> 12:25.161
Is it on an animal?

12:25.244 --> 12:27.914
Yeah. It's... it's on a rooster.

12:31.501 --> 12:33.586
Well, say "what up" to
your daughter for me.

12:33.670 --> 12:36.130
You know, I do castrations, too.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.393
- Hey, sexy.
- Hey.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.520
So, I got your text.

12:50.603 --> 12:51.646
What'd you want to talk about?

12:51.729 --> 12:53.690
Yeah, yeah. Uh...

12:54.607 --> 12:58.069
look, you know, I know you
liked that lingerie I got you...

12:58.152 --> 13:01.030
No, I loved your gift. I'm
wearing it right now.

13:01.531 --> 13:03.533
Well, not the bottoms.

13:04.241 --> 13:06.285
Oh, good Lord.

13:06.369 --> 13:07.370
Um...

13:08.287 --> 13:10.289
Yeah, look, about that, um...

13:12.334 --> 13:14.877
You know, it's been
real great seeing you.

13:14.961 --> 13:19.341
And you're a super special
girl and I'm sure you'll find a...

13:20.257 --> 13:22.134
motorcade of great guys.

13:25.472 --> 13:26.848
Wait, are you breaking up with me?

13:28.391 --> 13:30.142
- Yeah.
- Oh.

13:31.310 --> 13:32.311
Okay.

13:35.773 --> 13:38.360
That's it? You ain't gonna cry?

13:38.443 --> 13:40.695
You're not mad? I wore...
I wore this cup for nothing?

13:43.072 --> 13:44.991
Colt, look, I'm just
happy you did it in person

13:45.074 --> 13:46.451
and not over text
like my last boyfriend.

13:46.534 --> 13:50.037
What an asshole, that guy.

13:50.663 --> 13:51.914
Um...

13:51.998 --> 13:55.167
All right, well, cool.
You're... sure you're okay?

13:55.251 --> 13:58.170
Colt, I'm not looking to get
married or anything. I'm young.

13:58.254 --> 13:59.263
I thought you wanted to be

13:59.288 --> 14:00.839
in a relationship, you're the old one.

14:02.592 --> 14:04.636
Trust me, it's no big deal.

14:04.719 --> 14:07.430
All right. Wow, this is...
That's... This is really cool of you.

14:07.514 --> 14:08.765
All right. Good.

14:09.682 --> 14:10.767
So, uh...

14:11.768 --> 14:13.019
guess I'll see you around then.

14:13.102 --> 14:15.730
Yeah. Or we could keep having sex.

14:16.355 --> 14:18.941
I am so glad I didn't
break up with you over text.

14:22.236 --> 14:24.989
Hey, how's he doing?

14:25.072 --> 14:26.574
Fine.

14:27.950 --> 14:29.661
I brought you some soup from the bar.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.163
Hank threw in some deer jerky.

14:32.246 --> 14:34.874
Although I saw the front
of his car was smashed in,

14:34.957 --> 14:36.709
so eat it at your own risk.

14:37.960 --> 14:38.961
Not hungry.

14:40.087 --> 14:42.089
You gotta take care of yourself.

14:42.173 --> 14:43.508
I'm doing all right.

14:44.426 --> 14:48.471
Okay, we're up to three-word
answers. That's progress.

14:49.931 --> 14:52.600
Why are you here?

14:55.269 --> 14:58.440
Because you're my husband.

15:01.776 --> 15:05.112
I'm not sure that word means
the same to both of us.

15:05.196 --> 15:07.114
Beau, I love you.

15:07.198 --> 15:10.034
I'm just not sure that
I can live with you.

15:11.077 --> 15:13.120
What man doesn't want to hear that?

15:14.622 --> 15:17.374
I don't want to hurt you. It's
just the way it has to be.

15:17.459 --> 15:19.658
That's the last thing I say to my steers

15:19.682 --> 15:21.987
just before I take
them to be slaughtered.

15:22.046 --> 15:23.047
Not you.

15:25.049 --> 15:28.010
I just don't understand what's
wrong with what we have.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.471
Are you kidding me?

15:29.554 --> 15:32.557
We are a husband and a wife and
we live in separate houses.

15:33.140 --> 15:35.059
Might as well live in California.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.354
It's worked for us for years.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.773
Well, it's not working for me anymore.

15:40.857 --> 15:45.987
Really? 'Cause, right now, I only
see you about 10% of the time,

15:46.070 --> 15:48.615
but when I do, I have
100% of your attention.

15:48.698 --> 15:50.157
If I move back in,

15:50.241 --> 15:53.578
I'd have 10% of your
attention 100% of the time.

15:53.661 --> 15:56.247
I got zero percent for you right now...

15:57.457 --> 15:58.937
'cause I gotta worry about this calf.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.127
Oh, come on, Beau.

16:01.210 --> 16:03.505
I worked this ranch
with you for 30 years.

16:03.588 --> 16:06.257
I know there's nothing to
do for that calf but wait.

16:06.340 --> 16:09.426
You're just using it as an
excuse not to talk about this.

16:09.511 --> 16:11.679
Then why are we still talking?

16:11.763 --> 16:15.141
You know, your
attitude has made me change my mind.

16:15.224 --> 16:19.145
I'd love to move back in and
have every day be just like this.

16:21.397 --> 16:22.690
Thanks for the soup.

16:22.774 --> 16:24.651
Thanks for nothing.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.197
What? She started it.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.040
Hey, Mom, where you goin'?

16:40.833 --> 16:41.876
You okay?

16:41.959 --> 16:43.711
Yeah, I'm fine.

16:43.795 --> 16:45.046
What happened? Did the cow die?

16:45.963 --> 16:48.675
Did Dad die? Did you kill Dad?

16:49.759 --> 16:51.928
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.176
Are you sure you're all right?

16:53.201 --> 16:54.676
You want me to come down to the bar?

16:55.306 --> 16:56.786
Not to drink, but, you know, to talk.

16:57.684 --> 17:00.165
Although I'll probably still
have a drink, I mean, it is a bar.

17:00.937 --> 17:02.939
No, just stay with your dad.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.357
Love you, Jameson.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.319
Love you too, Margaret.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.157
I don't know why I said your
first name like that.

17:14.241 --> 17:17.829
You did it and it felt right, then
I did it and it felt really weird.

17:20.455 --> 17:23.710
Love you, Mom!
There it is! That's better!

17:25.837 --> 17:28.339
Hey, Dad, what happened with
Mom? Why is she so upset?

17:30.758 --> 17:32.635
Dad? Beau?

17:33.553 --> 17:35.096
That was weird.

17:35.179 --> 17:36.681
Drake, where you going?

17:37.724 --> 17:38.850
Hey, where you going?

17:41.102 --> 17:42.394
Why won't anybody answer me?

17:45.481 --> 17:47.900
Hey, what's going on?

17:48.901 --> 17:51.988
I'm calling the vet. I'm
getting the antibiotics.

17:52.529 --> 17:54.250
I thought we decided that
was too expensive.

17:55.241 --> 17:56.993
I changed my mind.

17:58.285 --> 18:00.663
What? You don't change your mind.

18:01.330 --> 18:02.498
You still think left-handed people

18:02.582 --> 18:04.667
just haven't learned how
to use their right hand yet.

18:05.376 --> 18:09.421
That calf will bring $1,200
if we can get it to the sale.

18:09.505 --> 18:10.882
I'm gonna make the gamble.

18:11.674 --> 18:14.677
Well, $250 is a lot of money right now.

18:15.595 --> 18:16.822
What the hell are we supposed to do

18:16.846 --> 18:18.038
if something else goes wrong, huh?

18:18.097 --> 18:20.618
I mean, Colt's already burned
down the barn and Mom's Airstream.

18:20.683 --> 18:22.351
Who knows what he's gonna torch next?

18:22.434 --> 18:24.353
It's not a discussion, Rooster.

18:24.937 --> 18:25.938
It's just one calf.

18:26.022 --> 18:28.775
Did I miss the part where
I asked for your opinion?

18:31.110 --> 18:32.945
I think you're letting your
emotions get the better of you.

18:33.029 --> 18:34.989
I'm saving that damn calf!

18:35.072 --> 18:36.490
Fine! Call the vet!

18:37.992 --> 18:39.076
You win, Dale.

18:39.160 --> 18:42.955
I'll buy your damn drugs if you
think it'll save my fucking calf.

18:44.206 --> 18:45.207
Oh!

18:45.291 --> 18:47.543
I am so sorry, Charlene.

18:52.256 --> 18:54.050
I am not a reckless driver.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.391
I'm just saying, you were staring at me

18:56.416 --> 18:57.911
and you almost ran into
that convertible.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.097
Yeah, well, you
both had your top down.

19:02.183 --> 19:04.018
Why is there a light on in your barn?

19:04.101 --> 19:05.102
Oh.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.230
Dad's probably still out
there with that sick calf.

19:09.023 --> 19:10.524
Oh, no, that's sad.

19:10.607 --> 19:12.168
Should we go see if he needs some help?

19:12.443 --> 19:15.071
Oh, no. No. My dad's not big on help.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.198
Pretty sure if he was
stranded on a desert island,

19:17.281 --> 19:19.522
he'd write a message in the
sand that said, "I got this."

19:21.493 --> 19:22.494
Colt, come on.

19:22.578 --> 19:23.979
We should at least go check on him.

19:24.747 --> 19:26.916
If you do, I won't make
you snuggle me after sex.

19:29.376 --> 19:30.753
But I like that part.

19:34.423 --> 19:37.218
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Mr. Bennett.

19:37.301 --> 19:39.553
- Hi, Heather.
- How's he doin'?

19:40.471 --> 19:43.432
Well, he's got a bacterial infection.

19:43.515 --> 19:46.643
- I just gave him a dose of antibiotics.
- Poor guy.

19:47.561 --> 19:49.856
Same thing happened to my calf in 4-H.

19:49.939 --> 19:52.441
You were in 4-H? I didn't know that.

19:52.524 --> 19:55.737
To be fair, we don't do a
lot of talking.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.865
I was in 4-H when I was a kid.

19:59.365 --> 20:00.366
I didn't know that.

20:01.408 --> 20:04.036
To be fair, we don't do a
whole lot of talking either.

20:05.872 --> 20:09.834
I loved 4-H. I named
my first calf The Duke,

20:09.917 --> 20:11.252
after John Wayne.

20:11.335 --> 20:14.756
I named mine Dairy
Potter, after Harry Potter.

20:15.715 --> 20:16.924
That's cute.

20:17.508 --> 20:18.801
At least I think it is.

20:20.594 --> 20:22.346
I had a gerbil named Warren Moon.

20:25.682 --> 20:28.060
You still remember the pledge?

20:28.978 --> 20:31.022
"I pledge my head to clearer thinking.

20:31.105 --> 20:32.689
My heart to greater loyalty."

20:32.774 --> 20:35.276
"My hands to larger service...

20:35.359 --> 20:37.820
and my health to better living."

20:38.780 --> 20:40.072
That was really cool.

20:40.156 --> 20:41.365
"For my club..."

20:41.448 --> 20:42.909
Oh, good, there's more.

20:42.992 --> 20:47.246
"My community,
my country, and my world."

20:48.622 --> 20:49.749
Amen.

20:50.541 --> 20:52.919
Okay, this is great.

20:53.002 --> 20:54.378
Heather, do you wanna head inside?

20:54.461 --> 20:56.338
Did your calf survive?

20:56.964 --> 20:58.507
Yeah, he did.

20:58.590 --> 21:01.844
It was a rough 48
hours, but he pulled through.

21:02.428 --> 21:03.888
Well, that's what we need here.

21:03.971 --> 21:07.058
Two weeks later, he was
mauled by a mountain lion.

21:07.141 --> 21:08.225
Oh, shit.

21:10.978 --> 21:13.105
Warren Moon choked on
a piece of Lite-Brite.

21:15.732 --> 21:18.235
Tried to give him the
Heimlich. Crushed his vertebrae.

21:19.779 --> 21:20.780
Real sad.

21:25.576 --> 21:26.577
You know, Mr. Bennett,

21:26.660 --> 21:28.581
there's nothing much
more you can do for him now.

21:28.662 --> 21:30.998
You should probably just
try to go get some rest.

21:31.082 --> 21:33.750
Yeah, you're right about
that. But I'm fine here.

21:34.668 --> 21:36.087
You guys go have a good night.

21:36.170 --> 21:37.463
Come on, Heather.

21:40.883 --> 21:41.884
You know...

21:42.969 --> 21:44.428
it's just bad luck, really.

21:44.511 --> 21:47.056
Happens to even the
greatest ranchers. Obviously.

21:47.849 --> 21:50.142
Well, I appreciate you
saying that, sweetheart.

21:52.228 --> 21:54.856
- Good night, Mr. Bennett.
- Good night. Say hi to your mom.

21:55.772 --> 21:56.773
Good night, Dad.

21:59.193 --> 22:00.194
Right.

22:01.112 --> 22:02.154
Good luck.

22:05.282 --> 22:07.284
Dad took quite a shine to you.

22:07.368 --> 22:08.870
Well, yeah, he's so
easy to get along with.

22:10.872 --> 22:11.914
Oh, you're serious.

22:11.998 --> 22:13.582
Oh, no, he's not.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.585
I can't believe he hugged you.

22:16.668 --> 22:19.088
'Course he only hugged
me twice in my life...

22:19.171 --> 22:20.923
and one time, I think he just tripped

22:21.007 --> 22:23.300
and grabbed me to keep from falling.

22:24.676 --> 22:26.501
Guys do that to me all the time.

22:26.527 --> 22:28.580
Except they always land like this.

22:33.310 --> 22:34.395
Honestly...

22:35.271 --> 22:37.314
I never took you for the 4-H type.

22:37.398 --> 22:39.775
What type did you think I was?

22:40.609 --> 22:43.695
I don't know. Hot cheerleader?

22:43.779 --> 22:45.614
Yeah, well, I wasn't.

22:46.532 --> 22:47.909
Doesn't it make you
mad when people assume

22:47.992 --> 22:49.872
you're just a really
attractive football player?

22:50.744 --> 22:51.996
No. It's awesome.

22:54.331 --> 22:57.334
Yeah, well, I was a tomboy. It's
what got me competing in rodeos.

22:57.418 --> 22:59.836
Whoa, hold on. You were in rodeos?

22:59.921 --> 23:01.797
Yeah! Still am.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.264
Me and my cousin were Colorado

23:03.290 --> 23:04.950
All Girls Roping Champs last year.

23:05.009 --> 23:07.428
Wow. You guys must've been really good.

23:08.095 --> 23:09.388
Hell yeah, we were good.

23:09.471 --> 23:11.432
I mean, you think you've got a
lot of trophies up in your room,

23:11.515 --> 23:12.635
just wait till you see mine.

23:13.261 --> 23:14.918
I even got a picture
with the president.

23:14.977 --> 23:16.979
Really? W?

23:17.063 --> 23:18.855
- Obama.
- Oh.

23:25.154 --> 23:27.448
So, uh, what's up, you still compete?

23:27.531 --> 23:30.451
Yeah. Got a roping in a couple weeks.

23:30.534 --> 23:33.329
Cool. I'd love to come
down and see you ride.

23:33.412 --> 23:34.871
Really?

23:34.956 --> 23:38.125
Yeah. But just know, if you
mess up, you will be heckled.

23:38.209 --> 23:39.418
Boo!

23:40.461 --> 23:43.380
I'd like it if
you came out and watched.

23:43.464 --> 23:44.631
I work really hard at it.

23:44.715 --> 23:45.799
Yeah.

23:47.551 --> 23:49.472
Maybe afterward we could
get dinner or something?

23:50.637 --> 23:53.224
Sure. I think that'd be fun.

23:53.307 --> 23:54.516
I think it would.

23:55.851 --> 23:56.935
So, we're still having
sex tonight, right?

23:57.019 --> 23:58.104
Fuck yeah.

24:01.648 --> 24:03.317
So, roping, huh?

24:03.400 --> 24:05.861
Tied up a calf, you ever tie up a colt?

24:08.739 --> 24:12.034
And the boy's crying, "Shane! Shane!

24:13.410 --> 24:14.870
Come back, Shane."

24:16.830 --> 24:19.958
Then Shane rides off into the night.

24:22.794 --> 24:25.381
I don't know why, but it
gets me every time, too.

24:26.757 --> 24:28.050
I remember that movie.

24:29.551 --> 24:31.387
We watched it on our honeymoon.

24:32.179 --> 24:33.430
Three times.

24:35.016 --> 24:36.600
You drive all the way back out here

24:36.683 --> 24:39.853
to tell me that I ruined our
honeymoon, too?

24:39.936 --> 24:41.813
No. I didn't go home.

24:42.731 --> 24:44.525
I've just been driving around, thinking.

24:44.608 --> 24:47.361
I... I came up here
before to see if I could help you,

24:47.444 --> 24:49.321
I didn't wanna add to your problems.

24:50.572 --> 24:52.074
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, too.

24:53.117 --> 24:54.910
I should have taken
the time to talk to you.

24:57.996 --> 24:59.557
If it makes you feel any better,

24:59.582 --> 25:01.190
I burned my tongue on the soup.

25:01.250 --> 25:03.794
Actually, yeah. It does.

25:05.421 --> 25:08.006
Beau, I... I wanna be with you.

25:08.632 --> 25:10.509
I want to be with you too, Mags.

25:10.592 --> 25:13.179
But I want a lot of other things, too.

25:13.262 --> 25:15.556
I want my bar.

25:16.140 --> 25:17.183
I want to travel.

25:17.808 --> 25:19.935
And I want my
Airstream. It's my retreat.

25:20.018 --> 25:22.229
It's where I think, and
dream, and, I don't know,

25:22.313 --> 25:24.236
get high and listen to Bonnie Raitt,

25:24.261 --> 25:26.131
and cook burritos naked.

25:26.192 --> 25:30.112
I just don't know if I can do those
things if we're living together.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.531
Well...

25:32.614 --> 25:34.991
I suppose I can get to
like Bonnie Raitt, but...

25:35.909 --> 25:38.162
the burritos are a deal-breaker.

25:39.080 --> 25:40.789
What about you?

25:40.872 --> 25:42.791
Aren't there other things you want?

25:42.874 --> 25:44.418
Here's what I want, Mags...

25:45.586 --> 25:46.878
I want you...

25:47.796 --> 25:50.424
me, and the ranch.

25:51.592 --> 25:53.302
The boys are optional.

25:56.430 --> 25:57.764
Well, you have all that.

25:59.391 --> 26:00.892
I'm 70 years old.

26:02.228 --> 26:04.188
I don't know how much time I have left.

26:05.606 --> 26:08.734
I want to live under
the same roof as my wife.

26:09.360 --> 26:13.655
I like my life the way
it is. I like my space.

26:14.906 --> 26:16.658
You like it more than being a family?

26:16.742 --> 26:17.951
We are a family, Beau.

26:18.034 --> 26:20.829
We haven't been a family since you left.

26:22.289 --> 26:25.917
And if there's no
chance in changing that...

26:27.961 --> 26:29.963
then maybe we oughta call it quits.

26:32.924 --> 26:34.593
Are you talking about a divorce?

26:37.053 --> 26:38.264
I guess so.

26:39.806 --> 26:41.099
Wow.

26:43.144 --> 26:44.186
There it is.

27:00.619 --> 27:01.745
Hey, where you been?

27:02.746 --> 27:05.249
Dropping off Heather. What
are you guys still doing up?

27:08.001 --> 27:09.795
Calf's dead.

27:11.588 --> 27:12.589
Shit.

27:16.343 --> 27:17.344
Sorry, Dad.

27:18.679 --> 27:20.764
Well, I should've listened to Rooster.

27:21.765 --> 27:22.891
Could have gone either way.

27:22.974 --> 27:26.228
Don't ever apologize for
not taking Rooster's advice.

27:28.146 --> 27:30.232
It's been a lousy couple of days.

27:31.608 --> 27:34.986
And all I got to show for it
is a vet bill for a dead calf.

27:36.863 --> 27:38.240
How's things with Ma?

27:38.907 --> 27:40.409
I don't wanna talk about it.

27:40.492 --> 27:41.535
You sure?

27:41.618 --> 27:42.786
Yeah.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.283
All right. Let's get the tractor

27:50.308 --> 27:52.069
and put that calf in the ground.

27:52.128 --> 27:54.215
We can take care of that in the morning.

27:54.965 --> 27:56.550
No.

27:56.633 --> 27:57.634
Today sucked.

27:58.885 --> 28:00.887
Let's get it over
with, put it behind us.

28:02.639 --> 28:03.640
He's right.

28:04.641 --> 28:06.342
Plus, Colt's volunteering for work.

28:06.367 --> 28:07.878
We can't miss this opportunity.

28:09.980 --> 28:12.774
Yeah, it's not like I'm going
to sleep tonight, anyway.

28:20.616 --> 28:21.617
Thanks, boys.

28:23.452 --> 28:26.162
Look... Dad, I'm just glad you...

28:35.547 --> 28:37.048
I feel so safe.

28:39.134 --> 28:41.552
Dude, that does not count.

28:42.804 --> 28:44.681
I'm still up four hugs to two.
