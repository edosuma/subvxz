00:00.010 --> 00:02.467
Wouldn't it be crazy
if this plane just...

00:02.469 --> 00:04.420
Last season on "Wrecked"...

00:04.440 --> 00:06.440
We're pirates, mother...

00:06.460 --> 00:08.860
- They're gonna kill us!
- So we'll take 'em out all at once.

00:09.342 --> 00:10.980
My friends and I are going home.

00:11.020 --> 00:12.800
The pirates came here on a cruise ship?

00:12.860 --> 00:15.679
- Me and Todd...
- We're getting married!

00:15.680 --> 00:16.940
I have feelings for you!

00:17.000 --> 00:18.640
I have feelings for you, too!

00:19.410 --> 00:20.720
- Luther?
- Yes?

00:22.260 --> 00:23.699
Abandon ship!

00:23.700 --> 00:24.700
I thought I was gonna die in here,

00:24.710 --> 00:27.160
but instead, I met you,
my new best friend.

00:27.290 --> 00:29.619
We got land!

00:29.620 --> 00:31.020
We're alive!

00:32.031 --> 00:33.099
Luther!!

00:33.100 --> 00:34.780
He stood on a land mine!

What the hell?

01:29.680 --> 01:31.480
Oh, come on!

01:31.560 --> 01:33.019
Whoo!

01:33.020 --> 01:34.150
Got him!

01:34.160 --> 01:36.020
What's that, three years in a row?

01:36.030 --> 01:37.239
How did I do it?

01:37.240 --> 01:38.660
I wore the wrong boots.

01:38.680 --> 01:40.780
They're too tight. I
can't run in 'em, okay?!

01:40.820 --> 01:43.100
God damn it!

01:43.250 --> 01:44.710
Well, Errol, how 'bout you?

01:44.720 --> 01:46.719
How's the, uh, night-vision thing?

01:46.720 --> 01:48.100
Was that a big help?

01:48.790 --> 01:50.319
You know what, dude?

01:50.320 --> 01:52.059
You're being a real bully, okay?

01:52.060 --> 01:53.520
- Come on.
- Yeah, you are. You are.

01:53.530 --> 01:54.920
We're all here having a good time,

01:54.930 --> 01:57.059
we all running through
the jungle like friends,

01:57.060 --> 01:58.859
and then all of a sudden
you're acting like a jerk.

01:58.860 --> 01:59.900
- A jerk?
- Yeah.

01:59.920 --> 02:00.976
- Is that what I'm being?
- Yeah, you're being

02:01.000 --> 02:02.360
- a real jerk.
- Really? You think that's fair?

02:02.370 --> 02:03.696
You think that your jokes are funny.

02:03.720 --> 02:06.000
- They're not funny.
- I'm not... I'm just...

02:08.340 --> 02:10.070
- I found it!
- Hold on. H-Hold on.

02:10.080 --> 02:11.500
This guy's trying to say something.

02:12.280 --> 02:14.540
- What is it?
- Go to hell.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.410
Okay, see, this is exactly
why we call you "Mumbles."

02:17.420 --> 02:18.900
You have to enunciate.

02:21.120 --> 02:22.489
- Uh...
- Oh.

02:22.490 --> 02:24.150
Ew! Gross!

02:24.160 --> 02:26.900
That is gross. Have some class.

02:26.980 --> 02:30.560
One day someone's gonna
land on this island

02:30.600 --> 02:33.220
and they're not gonna play your games.

02:33.300 --> 02:34.540
No.

02:34.660 --> 02:38.080
They'll be smart and brave,

02:38.700 --> 02:41.040
and they'll kill you.

02:41.240 --> 02:43.040
Oh, yeah?

02:43.520 --> 02:45.300
And who might that be?

02:48.740 --> 02:50.259
Seriously?!

02:50.260 --> 02:52.260
Can we not catch one break?!

02:57.790 --> 03:00.200
So, what? There could
be land mines anywhere?

03:00.240 --> 03:02.859
We don't know that. It
could've been just one...

03:02.860 --> 03:06.420
just one rogue land mine
washed up on the shore...

03:12.200 --> 03:13.660
Maybe it was just the two.

03:15.540 --> 03:17.840
Okay! Everybody, stay where you are!

03:17.900 --> 03:19.999
We need to come up with a plan

03:20.000 --> 03:21.320
to get off this beach.

03:25.880 --> 03:27.570
Well, I don't have one. I was just...

03:27.580 --> 03:29.149
Okay, well, it just sounded
like you had a plan.

03:29.150 --> 03:30.489
Yeah, I just thought you'd have
some blowhard plan by now.

03:30.490 --> 03:32.280
I have a couple of seeds.
I'm just kind of...

03:32.360 --> 03:34.889
They're not really... I'm
thinking. I'm thinking.

03:34.890 --> 03:37.680
All right, I think it's pretty
obvious what needs to happen.

03:37.700 --> 03:39.560
Someone needs to walk off the beach.

03:39.760 --> 03:41.979
And if, knock on wood,

03:41.980 --> 03:44.080
that person makes it out alive,

03:44.440 --> 03:46.460
we use their footprints to escape.

03:47.120 --> 03:48.520
But who goes?

03:49.980 --> 03:51.199
Listen...

03:51.200 --> 03:53.740
there are only nine of us left.

03:53.910 --> 03:56.720
The person with the
least value should go.

03:57.080 --> 03:59.960
Now, Jess, you're great for morale.

04:00.020 --> 04:01.580
I think you're an absolute delight.

04:01.620 --> 04:03.020
Aww. Karen.

04:03.040 --> 04:04.650
But physically, you're
a goddamn liability.

04:04.660 --> 04:06.259
- You have virtually no upper-body strength.
- What?

04:06.260 --> 04:08.330
- That's rough.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

04:08.340 --> 04:10.059
No one makes my wife

04:10.060 --> 04:11.996
- walk through a bunch of land mines.
- Thanks, babe.

04:12.020 --> 04:14.380
You got it, babe. Now,
if we're gonna choose,

04:14.440 --> 04:17.620
we're gonna choose fairly and humanely.

04:18.620 --> 04:19.790
All right.

04:19.800 --> 04:20.800
Nose goes.

04:20.810 --> 04:21.869
- Oh!
- Oh!

04:21.870 --> 04:23.009
Oh, it's Steve!

04:23.010 --> 04:24.339
Steve's got to go.

04:24.340 --> 04:26.180
Fair is fair. Someone tell Steve

04:26.190 --> 04:27.190
he's got to walk off the beach,

04:27.200 --> 04:29.060
probably blow up. Florence?

04:29.380 --> 04:30.440
What?

04:34.150 --> 04:35.180
Steve?

04:35.820 --> 04:37.260
Hey, Steve!

04:37.560 --> 04:39.360
Whattya got there, bud?

04:40.630 --> 04:42.240
Luther's hand!

04:42.280 --> 04:43.500
Oh.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.040
Oh, no.

04:45.060 --> 04:47.560
I figured if... if I can
collect enough of him,

04:47.570 --> 04:48.840
uh, we can fix him.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.899
There's a lot they can do these days.

04:52.900 --> 04:55.970
They cloned that sheep.
So that'll probably work.

04:56.640 --> 04:58.779
Or there's that Jonathan Depp movie

04:58.780 --> 05:01.880
where they uploaded his
brain into a Macintosh.

05:02.280 --> 05:04.700
Oh, my God. You guys,
he c... he can't go.

05:04.710 --> 05:07.120
- Look how sad he is.
- Hey! Old man Steve!

05:07.390 --> 05:09.850
We all played Nose goes
and we won and you lost!

05:09.860 --> 05:11.859
You got to walk your ass off the beach

05:11.860 --> 05:14.260
so we can see if you blow up, okay?!

05:14.860 --> 05:16.529
- What?!
- Yeah.

05:16.530 --> 05:18.659
- No!
- You lost the game, though.

05:18.660 --> 05:20.729
- You kind of have to.
- We played Nose goes.

05:26.520 --> 05:27.960
Okay, I have a plan.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.460
We do nothing.

05:31.480 --> 05:32.600
What?

05:32.680 --> 05:35.120
Somebody buried these land mines, right?

05:35.180 --> 05:36.610
Someone is here.

05:36.620 --> 05:38.950
And that means that somebody heard

05:39.320 --> 05:41.140
whoever that guy was explode,

05:41.160 --> 05:43.149
and that means that
they will come to us.

05:43.150 --> 05:45.019
But if no one comes, huh?

05:45.020 --> 05:46.820
What are we supposed to
do here, just starve?

05:46.830 --> 05:48.690
It may not look like much, but this body

05:48.700 --> 05:51.229
takes some serious cals to maintain,

05:51.230 --> 05:53.300
and Daddy's already pretty hungry.

05:53.430 --> 05:55.430
Well, would Daddy rather
be pretty hungry,

05:55.440 --> 05:56.899
or would Daddy like to see someone else

05:56.900 --> 05:58.460
blown into a fine mist?

05:58.470 --> 05:59.740
Huh? Which one?

06:01.500 --> 06:02.700
A hungry daddy.

06:02.900 --> 06:04.200
Okay.

06:04.540 --> 06:06.240
So then we wait.

06:07.820 --> 06:09.779
We wait.

06:23.480 --> 06:25.260
- I've got you!
- Aah!

06:31.960 --> 06:34.220
Now, before everyone digs in,

06:34.240 --> 06:36.680
just remember, we have
to ration this food.

06:36.700 --> 06:39.200
We don't know when it is
that we'll eat again.

06:40.210 --> 06:42.279
I'm kidding!

06:42.280 --> 06:44.600
I'm kidding! We're not
on the island anymore.

06:44.620 --> 06:47.240
We're obviously in the future...
some of us have mustaches.

06:47.540 --> 06:49.619
Ah! Yeah!

06:49.620 --> 06:50.840
Uh, Daniel Jr.!

06:50.960 --> 06:52.960
Other Daniel Jr.! Come here.

06:54.620 --> 06:55.829
All right.

06:55.830 --> 06:57.359
Did I ever tell you boys

06:57.360 --> 06:59.020
about the time that your Uncle Danny

06:59.100 --> 07:01.520
saved us from exploding?

07:01.700 --> 07:02.800
Hmm?

07:02.820 --> 07:04.040
There we were,

07:04.100 --> 07:07.039
trapped on a beach that was
filled with land mines,

07:07.040 --> 07:08.909
and no one knew what to do.

07:08.910 --> 07:10.570
But then your Uncle Danny...

07:10.580 --> 07:12.739
He just stood up,

07:12.740 --> 07:14.660
and he walked off that beach.

07:14.910 --> 07:16.660
- And he saved us.
- Mm-hmm.

07:16.740 --> 07:18.260
And do you know how he did it?

07:18.300 --> 07:19.480
Hmm?

07:20.720 --> 07:22.650
He believed.

07:25.820 --> 07:27.200
Go wake your uncle up.

07:27.240 --> 07:28.760
Wake him up.

07:28.820 --> 07:30.050
Wake him up.

07:30.060 --> 07:31.720
Get up!

07:37.270 --> 07:38.759
Owen.

07:38.760 --> 07:39.939
Owen, wake up.

07:39.940 --> 07:41.660
Hmm.

07:42.140 --> 07:43.870
I'm not afraid.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.520
I'm not afraid anymore.

07:45.880 --> 07:47.019
What?

07:47.020 --> 07:49.160
Hey, do you guys mind speaking up?!

07:49.210 --> 07:51.210
I can't hear anything!

07:51.220 --> 07:53.160
They were so beautiful.

07:53.260 --> 07:54.520
Who?

07:55.780 --> 07:58.680
Your boys. The Daniels.

07:58.890 --> 08:00.260
What are you talking about?

08:05.960 --> 08:07.480
Hey!

08:07.520 --> 08:08.620
Hey!!

08:08.700 --> 08:10.499
Come back here, you...

08:10.500 --> 08:11.900
you weird bush!

08:12.040 --> 08:14.060
Y-You blew up my best friend!

08:14.140 --> 08:16.239
You're not fooling anyone, you bush!

08:16.240 --> 08:18.980
We're not gonna die, not here.

08:19.240 --> 08:21.020
We just have to believe.

08:21.180 --> 08:23.100
Oh, Danny! Hey! Wait!

08:23.110 --> 08:24.110
- No! Oh.
- Danny! Danny!

08:44.340 --> 08:46.600
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

08:46.640 --> 08:49.469
I stepped on a land mine!

08:51.880 --> 08:53.280
Idiot!

08:55.220 --> 08:58.579
I don't want to die! I don't want
to die! I don't want to die!

08:58.580 --> 09:01.119
You! You! This is your fault!

09:01.120 --> 09:03.589
You lied to me right through
your stupid mustache!

09:03.590 --> 09:05.590
- What did you say to him?
- I didn't say anything.

09:06.930 --> 09:08.929
Uh, guys, Steve is walking
right towards us.

09:12.040 --> 09:14.199
- I saw someone in the jungle.
- What?

09:14.200 --> 09:16.339
He ran off, but whoever it was,

09:16.340 --> 09:18.069
he put these land mines down.

09:18.070 --> 09:19.539
He killed Luther.

09:19.540 --> 09:21.269
- And I'm going after him.
- What?

09:21.270 --> 09:23.560
Oh, please stop walking!

09:24.980 --> 09:27.279
Sorry. Can I just...
I'm gonna have to...

09:27.280 --> 09:29.609
Can I just...

09:30.670 --> 09:32.279
Thank you.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.240
What do we do now?

09:34.490 --> 09:37.220
Find whoever the hell Steve saw.

09:37.420 --> 09:39.660
If someone else is here,
maybe they can help Danny.

09:41.230 --> 09:42.759
Okay, you guys, go after Steve.

09:42.760 --> 09:44.300
We'll wait here with Danny.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.629
Single file! Single file, you guys!

09:46.630 --> 09:47.900
- ... the steps.
- Watch the...

09:47.960 --> 09:49.969
Yeah, you really bungled that one.

09:49.970 --> 09:51.230
All right, you're good. You'll make it.

09:51.240 --> 09:52.740
We love you, Danny. Bye.

09:52.840 --> 09:54.139
If things get hairy,

09:54.140 --> 09:55.660
Danny might want to take his own life.

09:55.700 --> 09:57.239
Here.

09:57.240 --> 09:59.180
- A switchblade.
- Yeah, big time.

09:59.840 --> 10:02.100
- Thank you, Chet.
- No, no. Thank you.

10:06.160 --> 10:08.900
They'll find help, right?
Steve's got this.

10:09.120 --> 10:11.360
Yeah, yeah. Steve's totally got this.

10:13.040 --> 10:14.319
We're gonna have to
save Danny ourselves,

10:14.320 --> 10:15.390
- aren't we?
- Yeah, I think so. We will.

10:15.400 --> 10:16.790
Yeah. For sure.

10:18.020 --> 10:20.150
Easy. Just keep your
foot on that trigger.

10:20.160 --> 10:21.420
We're gonna get you off this thing.

10:21.430 --> 10:23.330
I just got to think. I got to...

10:23.340 --> 10:24.740
Think, Owen, think!

10:24.800 --> 10:27.500
Danny, why would you just
walk out here like that?

10:27.520 --> 10:28.680
It was stupid.

10:28.820 --> 10:30.470
I had a vision, all right?

10:30.480 --> 10:31.970
We were in the future, all of us.

10:31.980 --> 10:34.020
We were at this beautiful dinner.

10:34.350 --> 10:36.540
Owen's kids were there,
and... and... and...

10:36.580 --> 10:38.760
a-and he told them that I saved us.

10:38.950 --> 10:40.920
Aww. You saw our kids?

10:41.000 --> 10:43.489
- Owen's kids.
- What's that, now?

10:43.490 --> 10:46.100
They were Owen's kids
with his wife, Gwen.

10:46.120 --> 10:47.840
She's real, real pretty.

10:48.380 --> 10:49.960
Did she look like me at all?

10:50.300 --> 10:52.160
Let me think. No.

10:52.240 --> 10:54.829
She was glowing...

10:54.830 --> 10:59.060
almost like she was
pregnant, but she wasn't.

10:59.300 --> 11:01.060
What? Where was I?

11:01.240 --> 11:02.570
Oh, you were there.

11:03.120 --> 11:05.379
You were sitting by the dessert table,

11:05.380 --> 11:09.300
glaring at everybody,
holding a mug of wine.

11:09.380 --> 11:12.020
Well, was I with anyone?

11:12.180 --> 11:14.360
Uh, kind of.

11:14.450 --> 11:17.450
I think his name was "Dirty Craig."

11:17.680 --> 11:19.960
Or at least that's what
people called him.

11:21.390 --> 11:25.060
My husband's name was "Dirty Craig"?

11:25.220 --> 11:28.280
Dirty Craig is not the marryin' type.

11:28.530 --> 11:30.760
Dirty Craig is a dog.

11:30.800 --> 11:32.650
They don't call him "Clean Craig."

11:32.660 --> 11:33.780
Okay, I got it. I got it.

11:33.790 --> 11:35.090
I got it. I got it. Here's
what we're gonna do...

11:35.100 --> 11:38.360
We are gonna dig a hole
around the land mine, right?

11:38.370 --> 11:39.739
Then we're gonna lift the mine up,

11:39.740 --> 11:41.379
and we're gonna wrap
something really tight

11:41.380 --> 11:43.570
around Danny's shoe and the mine,

11:43.580 --> 11:45.530
keeping the trigger down, okay?

11:45.540 --> 11:47.379
Then Danny will very slowly

11:47.380 --> 11:49.380
remove his foot from the shoe,

11:49.420 --> 11:52.689
leaving a land mine boot.

11:52.690 --> 11:55.159
We'll take that thing, throw it away...

11:55.160 --> 11:57.320
Boom! Danny's saved.

11:58.300 --> 12:00.260
What do you think?

12:01.400 --> 12:03.030
- No. Oh, my God,
- Are you mad at me?

12:03.040 --> 12:04.569
- no.
- Do you want me to die?

12:04.570 --> 12:06.380
Okay, do you guys have any ideas?

12:06.710 --> 12:10.400
Listen, I've seen every
action movie ever made.

12:10.710 --> 12:14.020
There's only one way to
deal with a bomb situation.

12:14.860 --> 12:16.720
We got to defuse it.

12:24.790 --> 12:26.620
Steve, I don't see any evidence of...

12:26.640 --> 12:28.540
Shh!

12:28.920 --> 12:30.340
He came through here.

12:34.140 --> 12:35.460
He was running.

12:35.740 --> 12:37.069
Panicked.

12:38.520 --> 12:39.740
Frantic.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.540
He tripped...

12:41.620 --> 12:43.200
right into this bush.

12:43.420 --> 12:45.039
He laid here,

12:45.040 --> 12:46.949
terrified of the one man on this island

12:46.950 --> 12:48.660
that was capable of killing him...

12:48.740 --> 12:50.600
"Steve."

12:50.700 --> 12:52.280
Steve.

12:53.780 --> 12:55.380
That's when he shit his bush pants.

12:55.440 --> 12:56.440
His what?

12:56.500 --> 12:58.420
- Bush pants.
- What are "bush pants"?

12:58.540 --> 13:00.319
Imagine a pair of pants,

13:00.320 --> 13:02.320
and then imagine two bushes.

13:02.440 --> 13:05.029
Now, get rid of the
pants from your memory,

13:05.030 --> 13:07.760
reposition those bushes
where your pants would be,

13:07.860 --> 13:10.540
so he's wearing two... two bushes.

13:11.120 --> 13:12.340
Bush pants.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.080
I thought you said he
was wearing a suit.

13:14.170 --> 13:15.679
A bush suit!

13:15.680 --> 13:16.880
Yeah!

13:17.110 --> 13:19.440
Made out of twigs and bushes!

13:20.510 --> 13:22.320
Nature! Nature wear!

13:22.360 --> 13:24.380
Jesus, just keep up with me!

13:24.580 --> 13:26.320
Come on.

13:27.320 --> 13:30.140
Are we sure Steve actually saw someone?

13:30.160 --> 13:32.500
- No. No, we are not.
- Okay.

13:34.140 --> 13:36.120
Uh, you guys go ahead.

13:36.140 --> 13:38.630
I'll catch up. I gotta
pee with my penis.

13:43.080 --> 13:44.300
Oh, my God.

13:55.950 --> 13:58.880
You're stupid assholes.

14:02.820 --> 14:05.320
Okay. Now there's always some
type of access panel on the side.

14:05.360 --> 14:06.789
Do you see a panel?

14:06.790 --> 14:08.589
Um...

14:08.590 --> 14:10.859
yeah, actually.

14:10.860 --> 14:13.490
I take it it's fastened
with, what, four screws,

14:13.500 --> 14:15.680
all flathead, one in each corner?

14:16.400 --> 14:18.530
Yeah. That's exactly right.

14:18.540 --> 14:20.080
How many action movies have you seen?

14:20.120 --> 14:21.200
All of them.

14:22.140 --> 14:24.609
Now, we need to something
to unscrew it with.

14:28.480 --> 14:29.480
I'll do it.

14:34.960 --> 14:36.180
Easy.

14:36.480 --> 14:38.180
I got it.

14:39.440 --> 14:40.560
Easy.

14:40.580 --> 14:41.980
I got it!

14:42.520 --> 14:45.559
Sorry I've got these sweaty
little sausage fingers

14:45.560 --> 14:48.340
and not delicate fairy hands like Gwen.

14:48.350 --> 14:49.360
Who?

14:49.840 --> 14:52.600
Gwen! You wife? From Danny's dream?

14:52.700 --> 14:54.630
That's a dream. I don't
even know a Gwen.

14:54.640 --> 14:56.769
You know her well enough to
put two kids in her, okay?

14:56.770 --> 14:58.140
Is this really a conversation
that we're having?

14:58.150 --> 14:59.390
- Yeah, it is.
- I don't even know what you're talking about.

14:59.400 --> 15:00.709
- It hurt my feelings.
- Guys, guys.

15:00.710 --> 15:01.979
I'm standing on a bomb.

15:01.980 --> 15:04.249
- Sorry. Okay. Go ahead.
- Sorry.

15:04.250 --> 15:05.730
All right. Now, once you
get that panel off,

15:05.740 --> 15:08.620
you're gonna see three wires...
red, blue, and green.

15:08.720 --> 15:10.989
You're gonna want to cut the red wire.

15:10.990 --> 15:13.800
Always cut the red wire. Got it?

15:27.540 --> 15:29.040
We're closing in.

15:29.200 --> 15:30.470
Oh, my God. Again?

15:30.480 --> 15:31.809
Enough!

15:31.810 --> 15:34.540
Steve, we've been out here for hours.

15:34.550 --> 15:36.160
What are you doing?

15:36.940 --> 15:38.149
I'm tracking.

15:38.150 --> 15:40.680
No, you're not. You're licking sticks.

15:40.690 --> 15:43.880
Dude, face it... there's
no one out here.

15:43.890 --> 15:45.520
I know what I saw.

15:45.600 --> 15:48.759
I saw a man, and that man was a bush.

15:48.760 --> 15:51.290
Oh, it must have been me, 'cause,
here, look, I'm in a bush.

15:51.300 --> 15:53.500
Oh, ho, I'm the guy that Steve saw.

15:53.580 --> 15:55.120
If we want to help Danny,

15:55.300 --> 15:57.959
the best way to find someone
is to get to high ground.

15:57.960 --> 16:00.140
I got to agree with Karen on this one.

16:00.260 --> 16:02.840
Okay, priority one is Danny.

16:03.180 --> 16:05.839
Look, guys, if we're not
looking out for each other,

16:05.840 --> 16:07.910
if we're not helping one another,

16:07.980 --> 16:10.820
then what are we even doing, you know?

16:11.600 --> 16:13.420
Did you just eat something?

16:13.480 --> 16:14.780
What?

16:14.790 --> 16:16.919
Did I... Did I eat something?

16:16.920 --> 16:19.470
Really? You think that I got food

16:19.480 --> 16:22.240
and just wouldn't bring it back
and share it with you guys?

16:22.460 --> 16:24.190
Wow.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.599
You know what, Karen?

16:25.600 --> 16:27.399
Go yourself

16:27.400 --> 16:30.140
for thinking I would ever turn
my back on my best friends!

16:30.150 --> 16:32.420
You've got berry stains
all over your mouth.

16:37.280 --> 16:39.439
There just wasn't enough
to share, okay, you guys?

16:39.440 --> 16:40.940
You shit.

16:40.950 --> 16:42.549
- Are you kidding me?
- You guys should be thanking me,

16:42.550 --> 16:45.879
okay, 'cause these berries are
making me feel very weird.

16:45.880 --> 16:47.410
I mean, my hands are all sweaty,

16:47.420 --> 16:48.979
and my entire body's getting chills...

16:48.980 --> 16:50.020
Enough!

16:50.180 --> 16:53.019
This is the waste of time.

16:53.020 --> 16:54.289
The Bush Man's getting away.

16:54.290 --> 16:56.489
There's no one out here!

16:56.490 --> 16:57.780
There's someone here.

16:57.900 --> 16:59.760
I told you so, you flabby piece of shit.

16:59.770 --> 17:02.080
- Shut up, you Kiwi turd.
- Shh!

17:08.109 --> 17:10.970
Okay, well, are there
any other shades of red

17:11.000 --> 17:12.779
like a "fire truck" or a "merlot"?

17:12.780 --> 17:14.730
No, dude. They're all
the same color red,

17:14.740 --> 17:16.800
- and there's like a hundred of them.
- Okay.

17:17.460 --> 17:18.700
Okay. Pick one.

17:19.520 --> 17:20.940
- What?
- What? No way.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.220
Just pick a wire and cut it.

17:22.319 --> 17:23.989
I'm not gonna randomly just pick a wire.

17:23.990 --> 17:25.440
Pick a wire! Do it!

17:25.460 --> 17:27.569
Pick a wire right now,
Owen! Get in there!

17:27.579 --> 17:28.789
Okay, fine! I'll just pick one.

17:28.790 --> 17:30.529
- And if your leg blows up...
- Why are we all yelling?!

17:30.530 --> 17:33.140
- Just pick a wire! Come on! Do it! Now!
- I'll pick a wire!

17:35.000 --> 17:37.599
Oh! Yes! Yes!

17:37.600 --> 17:38.979
- It worked!
- We did it!

17:38.980 --> 17:41.200
Oh!

17:43.540 --> 17:45.200
- Oh. Hey.
- Why is it beeping?

17:48.880 --> 17:50.680
You two get out of here. Go!

17:50.720 --> 17:52.749
No. We're not gonna leave you here, man.

17:52.750 --> 17:54.519
Just go! Don't you get it?

17:54.520 --> 17:56.289
- I never liked you.
- What?

17:56.290 --> 17:58.350
You're a nerd, a dork.

17:58.360 --> 18:00.920
I only hung out with you because
I felt bad for you, dweeb.

18:00.980 --> 18:03.159
- Okay, I see what you're doing.
- Oh, do you?

18:03.160 --> 18:06.520
Because you're so smart with
your flight attendant degree?

18:06.580 --> 18:08.499
Did you even finish school, you loser?

18:08.500 --> 18:10.699
- Hey, easy!
- Okay, sorry. That got mean.

18:10.700 --> 18:12.080
Listen, I'm not gonna leave you.

18:14.240 --> 18:16.340
I was so stupid walking up here.

18:16.520 --> 18:18.280
Why did I think I could save everybody?

18:18.640 --> 18:19.979
At least you tried.

18:19.980 --> 18:22.560
I mean, I suggested that
we literally do nothing.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.439
And now I'm all worked
up because I feel like

18:25.440 --> 18:26.649
I'm gonna lose you two guys,

18:26.650 --> 18:28.649
and then it's just
gonna be me and the...

18:28.650 --> 18:31.720
I mean, let's just be honest... freaks.

18:32.440 --> 18:34.589
I just...

18:34.590 --> 18:36.020
I love you guys.

18:38.660 --> 18:39.960
No.

18:40.040 --> 18:41.740
We're not gonna die here.

18:41.870 --> 18:43.180
What are you talking about?

18:43.670 --> 18:46.400
I'm talking about land mine boot.

18:48.340 --> 18:50.660
Gorillas aren't aggressive, right?

18:50.940 --> 18:54.720
Nah. Nah, nah. Monkeys
are chill like humes.

18:54.940 --> 18:58.200
Okay? We just be calm and
they're happy to just be c...

19:05.500 --> 19:06.940
Into the trees!

19:11.640 --> 19:13.440
I'm gonna get eaten!

19:13.500 --> 19:16.029
Ah, come on! Help me!

19:16.030 --> 19:17.160
- Help me up!
- Get up!

19:17.180 --> 19:20.880
- Help me!
- Oh, God, why is your hand so sweaty?

19:20.910 --> 19:22.750
It's the berries! I feel insane!

19:22.760 --> 19:23.970
Jump higher!

19:23.980 --> 19:25.470
I can't! My legs are jelly!

19:27.120 --> 19:28.360
Oh, shit.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.400
- What do we do now?
- Throw it!

20:06.550 --> 20:10.560
You could have thrown that
literally anywhere else.

20:23.170 --> 20:24.320
I saw his balls.

20:25.940 --> 20:27.760
Oh, God. This is all my fault.

20:27.970 --> 20:30.109
Maybe I just wanted to see someone

20:30.110 --> 20:31.580
to make sense of Luther's death.

20:31.740 --> 20:34.119
You knew the guy for six hours.

20:34.120 --> 20:36.109
Why do you even care?!

20:36.110 --> 20:38.179
'Cause you guys just
tolerate me, all right?

20:38.180 --> 20:41.980
Luther... he actually liked me.

20:42.050 --> 20:45.189
No. Steve, we like you, okay?

20:45.190 --> 20:46.440
You're one of us.

20:46.590 --> 20:48.000
Really?

20:48.390 --> 20:49.720
Yeah.

20:50.130 --> 20:51.930
What do you like about me?

20:51.980 --> 20:55.580
- Oh, my God.
- Uh... your hair.

20:55.600 --> 20:56.659
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:56.660 --> 20:57.899
Oh, that's a good one.

20:57.900 --> 20:59.060
Todd?

21:00.720 --> 21:02.160
You're funny, I guess.

21:03.280 --> 21:05.840
Yeah. I'm pretty funny.

21:05.880 --> 21:07.180
What about you, Karen?

21:07.220 --> 21:09.320
Easy. You got an ass that won't quit.

21:11.380 --> 21:14.620
Oh, God. It's coming right at me!

21:16.150 --> 21:17.990
I can fix this!

21:19.240 --> 21:20.520
Oh, my God.

21:20.840 --> 21:22.359
Hey!

21:22.360 --> 21:24.360
Take a chomp on this perfect ass!

21:43.320 --> 21:46.019
Hello, there.
