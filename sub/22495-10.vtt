00:37.283 --> 00:39.918
Now, "Top Chef: Sweden"!

00:39.953 --> 00:42.321
Bork! Bork! Bork!

00:42.390 --> 00:43.623
Bork! Bork!

00:47.463 --> 00:49.997
Your challenge is --

00:50.033 --> 00:53.334
Your challenge -- your
challenge is to prepare the

00:53.370 --> 00:57.006
traditional Scandinavian
dish known as lutefisk!

00:57.041 --> 00:58.742
Bork!

00:58.777 --> 01:00.277
Step aside, dudes.

01:00.313 --> 01:01.813
Time for a shell spin!

01:01.881 --> 01:02.814
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:02.882 --> 01:03.815
Turtle power!

01:05.751 --> 01:07.184
Hey, hey.

01:07.220 --> 01:09.520
Hey, dudes, little, uh...

01:09.555 --> 01:11.155
Little help here!

01:11.190 --> 01:12.289
Leo?

01:12.325 --> 01:14.792
Little help!

01:14.827 --> 01:16.827
So, Loki like, "Please have mercy!"

01:16.896 --> 01:18.195
And I was all, "Sorry, pal.

01:18.264 --> 01:20.097
Can't hear a thing in this helmet."

01:20.132 --> 01:20.931
Ba-da-boom!

01:21.000 --> 01:22.799
Chest-mounted unibeam, baby.

01:23.769 --> 01:24.934
You is the man!

01:25.003 --> 01:27.003
Got a story from the
fight, jolly green?

01:27.071 --> 01:29.305
Well, hulk smash.

01:29.374 --> 01:31.173
And hulk smash.

01:31.209 --> 01:33.209
But then...Hulk smash!

01:33.244 --> 01:35.345
No freaking way, man!

01:35.380 --> 01:36.646
Swearsies.

01:37.516 --> 01:41.919
Okay, well, okay, so, I-I kicked this
guy, and I shot him with my pistols.

01:41.988 --> 01:47.090
And it turns out that he was, uh,
bulletproof and also kick-proof.

01:47.125 --> 01:48.091
Oh, God!

01:48.126 --> 01:49.759
I'm, like, the lamest one on this team!

01:49.795 --> 01:53.997
I don't even know why you
guys keep me around.

01:54.033 --> 01:59.404
Ohhhh, yeah.

01:59.439 --> 02:02.641
♪ Baby, baby, baby, baby ♪

02:06.013 --> 02:07.212
♪ Mm ♪

02:07.281 --> 02:08.380
Don't talk like that.

02:08.416 --> 02:10.382
You're a critical
component of this team.

02:10.418 --> 02:11.117
Right, fellas?

02:11.152 --> 02:11.784
Absolutely, uh-huh.

02:11.853 --> 02:12.685
Yeah. Sure.

02:12.754 --> 02:16.923
I guess whoever we fight next better
watch out for the black widow, huh?!

02:16.958 --> 02:18.124
Yeah!

02:18.159 --> 02:21.194
Black Widow's gone now, but
she leaves behind the gift of

02:21.230 --> 02:23.764
knowledge -- the knowledge
that you cannot defeat

02:23.832 --> 02:26.867
demogorge the God-eater
with a karate kick.

02:26.903 --> 02:29.336
But I almost got him with my arrows.

02:29.405 --> 02:31.238
Right -- right, guys?

02:32.609 --> 02:33.608
What am I saying?!

02:33.643 --> 02:37.145
I don't even know why you
guys keep me around!

02:37.181 --> 02:43.519
♪ Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh ♪

02:43.588 --> 02:49.058
Ohhh, yeah.

02:49.093 --> 02:51.860
Next Thursday on NBS... flatline!

02:51.896 --> 02:53.162
We're losing him!

02:53.197 --> 02:53.996
O-o-o-ouch!

02:54.065 --> 02:57.433
...a suicide victim will be saved...

02:57.502 --> 02:58.801
Hooray! He's alive!

02:58.836 --> 03:00.169
Damn it! I'm alive!

03:00.205 --> 03:04.240
...by the hospital's
most talented physician.

03:04.276 --> 03:07.611
But when Dr. E.T.'s old demons
come back to haunt him...

03:07.646 --> 03:09.546
I'll put it ri-i-i-ght here.

03:09.615 --> 03:12.249
Hey, prick, that's my girlfriend!

03:12.285 --> 03:14.452
Step off.

03:14.487 --> 03:15.086
O-o-ouch!

03:15.154 --> 03:17.789
...he'll face his
greatest challenge yet.

03:17.824 --> 03:18.723
He's dying.

03:18.792 --> 03:21.526
You have to do something... doctor.

03:21.561 --> 03:24.162
I'll be ri-i-i-i-ght back.

03:25.666 --> 03:27.165
Hey, that's my bike!

03:27.200 --> 03:28.366
Step off, bro.

03:33.106 --> 03:36.641
Thursday on an all-new
"E.T.-- Emergency Terrestrial."

03:36.710 --> 03:38.076
Yeah!

03:38.111 --> 03:39.177
Bachelor party!

03:39.245 --> 03:42.981
I'm buying you a lap dance, buddy!

03:44.584 --> 03:45.917
You wait right there, Harry.

03:45.985 --> 03:49.019
I'm gonna change into
something more comfortable.

03:49.055 --> 03:51.021
Dongus stoutus!

03:51.089 --> 03:53.256
Oh, come on.

03:53.292 --> 03:55.191
Uh, beefus girthus?

03:55.260 --> 03:56.660
Poleus maximus?

03:56.728 --> 03:58.395
Aaaaaah!

04:08.872 --> 04:09.839
Stalkus minimus!

04:09.908 --> 04:10.907
Stalkus minimus!

04:10.942 --> 04:12.842
Stalkus minimus!

04:12.911 --> 04:16.178
Now let me see what the famous
Harry Potter's packing.

04:17.583 --> 04:21.184
Why do you have a vadge?

04:28.228 --> 04:30.127
I-is he gone?

04:30.196 --> 04:31.495
Oh, phew!

04:31.530 --> 04:33.497
Dude's a [Bleep] stalker.

04:33.532 --> 04:35.132
The royal family!

04:35.167 --> 04:36.467
They're coming our way!

04:36.502 --> 04:38.669
Ohh, aren't they just adorable?

04:38.738 --> 04:41.038
Greatest...moment... of my life.

04:41.074 --> 04:43.574
Oh, and I've been totally
needing a new bra.

04:43.609 --> 04:44.842
What are you --
Aah!

04:44.877 --> 04:45.876
Aaaaah!

04:45.945 --> 04:47.411
I want one!

04:47.446 --> 04:48.512
Mommy! Daddy!

04:49.515 --> 04:51.415
Check it out -- pasties!

04:51.484 --> 04:54.051
Aaaagh!

04:55.254 --> 04:58.955
Now, girls, remember, we're
only here to browse.

04:58.991 --> 05:00.324
Daddy, no!

05:00.392 --> 05:01.925
I want them!

05:01.961 --> 05:02.760
You heard me!

05:02.795 --> 05:03.327
Let's go!

05:03.363 --> 05:04.962
This is so unfair.

05:04.998 --> 05:07.431
It's like he doesn't even
care how cruel he is!

05:10.737 --> 05:13.137
Godzilla has left the nation in ruins!

05:13.206 --> 05:13.972
Oh, no!

05:14.007 --> 05:16.408
California's most treasured landmark!

05:16.444 --> 05:17.042
Oh, no!

05:17.078 --> 05:19.779
California's most treasured
landmark despite what those

05:19.847 --> 05:21.614
a-holes down in Los Angeles think.

05:21.683 --> 05:24.050
Godzilla is pulling some hot
stripper-pole action on the

05:24.086 --> 05:26.419
sears tower or whatever the
[Bleep] we call it these days.

05:26.455 --> 05:26.987
What is it?

05:27.022 --> 05:28.055
Wil-- Willis Tower?

05:28.090 --> 05:29.790
I'm hearing Willis Tower.

05:29.825 --> 05:34.694
And after destroying Manhattan, Godzilla
is finally headed back out to sea.

05:34.763 --> 05:35.261
Oh!

05:35.297 --> 05:37.530
Total dick move by Godzilla.

05:37.566 --> 05:38.965
Nowhere near water is safe!

05:39.000 --> 05:42.335
It has never been a better
time to be a landlocked state.

05:42.404 --> 05:44.504
Tourism here in Des Moines
is through the roof!

05:44.540 --> 05:45.272
We're all rich!

05:47.009 --> 05:49.409
This is the mayor's assistant, Mr. G.

05:49.444 --> 05:51.277
Your check is in the mail.

05:51.346 --> 05:54.280
Ha ha ha ha!

05:54.349 --> 05:57.717
Oh, how the hell am I
supposed to cash this?

05:57.786 --> 06:01.455
Disneyland is a magical place
that's fun for the whole family.

06:01.523 --> 06:02.956
Even teenagers.

06:02.991 --> 06:06.159
Because at Disneyland, there are
dozens of secret places for

06:06.195 --> 06:08.461
young people to give
each other hand jobs.

06:08.497 --> 06:11.464
Come ride "The Many Adventures
of Winnie the Pooh."

06:11.499 --> 06:14.901
And when you exit, make a left
at the water fountain and find

06:14.970 --> 06:17.737
the perfect nook to give
or receive a hand job.

06:17.772 --> 06:21.341
Fill your hand job passport with
stamps from locations like...

06:21.377 --> 06:24.010
Behind the dumpster
next to the Matterhorn.

06:24.079 --> 06:27.381
Under the baby-changing
station in critter country.

06:27.450 --> 06:32.119
Or under the president's desk in
"Great Moments With Mr. Lincoln."

06:32.187 --> 06:36.656
Because as Walt Disney said... Disneyland
is the happiest place on earth...

06:36.725 --> 06:40.894
For teenagers to jizz all over
each other's young, Aryan hands.

06:45.401 --> 06:48.269
Presto changeo!

06:48.304 --> 06:54.208
Ugh, I say <i>presto</i> changeo,
not pesto changeo!

06:54.244 --> 06:57.745
And that's when the female Starbuck
got in the shower with me.

06:57.781 --> 06:58.279
Ooh!

06:58.314 --> 07:00.848
But from the neck down,
she was dirk Benedict.

07:00.917 --> 07:01.449
Ooh.

07:01.484 --> 07:03.718
And when I woke up, I still had wood.

07:03.753 --> 07:04.285
Ooh.

07:04.320 --> 07:06.954
Watch me scare those nerds!

07:08.224 --> 07:10.558
Munson!

07:10.593 --> 07:14.028
Munson might be going to prison.

07:14.096 --> 07:15.362
Dirk Benedict!

07:15.398 --> 07:17.832
Ow!

07:17.867 --> 07:19.767
Where is everybody?

07:19.802 --> 07:21.669
Hello-o-o-o?

07:21.704 --> 07:24.305
"Don't dead, open inside."

07:25.608 --> 07:28.642
Epic typography fail.

07:28.678 --> 07:32.313
Oh, my gosh, that's Courtney!

07:32.349 --> 07:33.214
Aah!

07:33.250 --> 07:33.949
Aaaaah!

07:34.017 --> 07:34.683
Oh, phew.

07:34.751 --> 07:36.017
You're not a walker.

07:36.053 --> 07:37.219
What? I-I'm not a what?

07:37.287 --> 07:39.588
It means zombie without
having to say "zombie."

07:39.623 --> 07:42.590
It's just one of the little details
that makes Robert Kirkman's

07:42.659 --> 07:45.694
"The Walking Dead" such an
intelligent and original -- Aah!

07:45.729 --> 07:46.495
Come with me!

07:46.563 --> 07:49.431
Apocalyptic crises tend to break
down social barriers, so it's

07:49.467 --> 07:51.767
totally likely that you
and I will fall in love.

07:51.803 --> 07:52.668
Whoa!

07:52.704 --> 07:54.137
Wait, wait, wait.

07:54.205 --> 07:55.872
I'm all yours, boys!

07:55.908 --> 07:56.973
Aah!

07:57.042 --> 07:58.342
Oh, dang.

07:58.410 --> 08:00.410
What caused the zombie outbreak?

08:00.446 --> 08:03.880
Let's consult the zombie
backstory generator!

08:03.949 --> 08:04.781
"Supervirus."

08:04.850 --> 08:05.983
Oh, wait a minute.

08:06.018 --> 08:07.518
They all say "supervirus."

08:08.888 --> 08:09.786
Munson!

08:09.855 --> 08:11.689
Those used to be people, you monster!

08:11.724 --> 08:13.424
Don't use them for target practice!

08:13.492 --> 08:16.861
Wipe the crap out of
your eyes, Dickstain.

08:16.896 --> 08:18.262
That's my mom's car!

08:18.330 --> 08:19.229
Knock it off!

08:20.899 --> 08:21.698
Uh-oh!

08:21.733 --> 08:23.166
Oh, come on!

08:24.336 --> 08:26.402
All those gunshots attracted them!

08:26.438 --> 08:27.870
We need to get out of here!

08:27.906 --> 08:29.071
Hey, turd burglars!

08:29.140 --> 08:31.540
Oh, yeah! The key!

08:34.145 --> 08:36.546
Hey, throw me that hacksaw!

08:36.581 --> 08:37.880
Thanks!

08:37.916 --> 08:38.548
Munson!

08:38.616 --> 08:40.082
Throw me another hacksaw.

08:40.118 --> 08:41.683
There are no more hacksaws.

08:41.720 --> 08:43.052
This is all we have left.

08:43.087 --> 08:46.089
How the [Bleep] does this help me?

08:46.124 --> 08:48.725
How did they get out of
this on "The Walking Dead"?

08:48.760 --> 08:51.827
Well, actually, in episode three--
No, no, no, don't tell me!

08:51.863 --> 08:54.730
I still have like a zillion
episodes on my DVR!

08:54.799 --> 08:58.267
Oh, man, I bet the show has tons of
clever tips for defeating zombies.

08:58.303 --> 08:59.102
We do!

08:59.170 --> 09:00.203
Wow!

09:00.271 --> 09:04.341
"Walking Dead" creator Robert Kirkman!

09:04.376 --> 09:07.344
So...can we have a tip?

09:07.379 --> 09:08.245
Here's a tip.

09:08.280 --> 09:09.812
Season two of "The Walking Dead"

09:09.848 --> 09:12.115
is now available on blu-ray and DVD!

09:12.183 --> 09:13.883
Aah! Ow! Ow! Aah!

09:13.918 --> 09:15.718
Oh! Wait a minute!

09:15.754 --> 09:17.920
I never wanted to see
what that looks like!

09:17.989 --> 09:19.555
Aaah!

09:19.624 --> 09:21.190
Uh-oh.

09:23.627 --> 09:24.459
Ew!

09:24.495 --> 09:25.527
Gross!

09:27.031 --> 09:29.031
It's like zombie camouflage.

09:29.100 --> 09:32.468
Just keep acting like
zombies -- no matter what.

09:32.537 --> 09:34.370
Oh, hey there, Courtney!

09:34.405 --> 09:36.839
Meeeeeeh, meeeh.

09:36.907 --> 09:41.743
Uhhhh... meeeeeeeh!

09:41.812 --> 09:43.299
Uhhhhh...

09:51.554 --> 09:54.656
I can't believe you're gonna
nail a cheerleader tonight!

09:54.725 --> 09:59.294
I wonder if zombie boobs
still feel like boobs.

09:59.329 --> 10:00.828
I call dibs.

10:00.863 --> 10:01.609
Ugh.

10:01.729 --> 10:03.449
Does anyone have a ziplock?
