WEBVTT

01:12.724 --> 01:16.163
Guys, we need to be
in the car in five.

01:16.206 --> 01:18.034
Uhp, two minutes.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.341
Julie, your homework
is in the den,

01:20.384 --> 01:21.907
and Alex...

01:21.951 --> 01:25.085
I'm not sure where
your baseball bag got to.

01:25.911 --> 01:27.913
I already put it by the door.

01:27.957 --> 01:29.263
Okay.

01:29.306 --> 01:31.091
Good.

01:32.918 --> 01:35.530
So, um...

01:35.573 --> 01:37.097
Tommy.

01:38.272 --> 01:39.621
I'm thinking

01:39.664 --> 01:41.753
maybe something's
going on with him.

01:41.797 --> 01:43.538
How come?

01:43.581 --> 01:48.412
He missed school, and a bunch
of baseball practices.

01:48.456 --> 01:50.806
Even after Coach told him
that he was about to lose

01:50.849 --> 01:52.764
his starting spot.

01:54.549 --> 01:56.203
Has he been sick?

01:56.246 --> 01:58.248
I don't think so.

01:58.292 --> 02:00.555
I asked him
if everything was okay,

02:00.598 --> 02:04.080
and he told me
to mind my own business.

02:07.953 --> 02:09.781
Have you spoken to him
since then?

02:09.825 --> 02:11.174
I texted.

02:11.218 --> 02:13.655
I didn't hear back.
I'm j-- I'm just...

02:13.698 --> 02:15.047
Worried.

02:17.180 --> 02:19.748
Well, his parents
got divorced last year,

02:19.791 --> 02:22.751
and his mom moved to Arizona
for that new job.

02:22.794 --> 02:24.709
It's a lot for a guy
to deal with.

02:25.493 --> 02:26.885
I know.

02:26.929 --> 02:30.628
He ever talk about
how things are at home?

02:30.672 --> 02:32.369
No.

02:32.413 --> 02:33.196
I was closer

02:33.240 --> 02:35.372
to his mom Romi, but...

02:35.416 --> 02:37.157
I should have called
to checked in to see

02:37.200 --> 02:38.680
how he and his dad were doing.

02:38.723 --> 02:40.638
So I'll do that.

02:40.682 --> 02:42.466
Okay?

02:43.467 --> 02:45.252
That'd be great.

02:45.295 --> 02:46.905
Thanks.

02:47.645 --> 02:49.560
Andy.

02:49.604 --> 02:50.735
It's Jane Tennant.

02:50.779 --> 02:53.042
I was talking to Alex

02:53.085 --> 02:55.610
and realized it's been a while
since we've seen you and Tommy.

02:55.653 --> 02:57.177
Love to have you guys over.

02:57.220 --> 02:58.613
I tried to leave a message
at your work,

02:58.656 --> 02:59.962
but I must
have the wrong number.

03:00.005 --> 03:02.486
So please give me a call
when you get this.

03:02.530 --> 03:04.140
All right,
let's set something up. Bye.

03:04.184 --> 03:07.230
All right, keep me posted.

03:07.274 --> 03:08.884
Hey, boss.
Hey.

03:08.927 --> 03:11.713
I'm gonna do a 360
around this container,

03:11.756 --> 03:14.498
but Kai will fill
you in, all right?
Okay.

03:15.499 --> 03:17.109
So, what do we know?

03:17.153 --> 03:19.590
Someone saw blood dripping out
of the container this morning,

03:19.634 --> 03:22.114
they opened the door,
found our victim

03:22.158 --> 03:25.248
Port Inspector Russell Goodrick
with three shots to the chest.

03:25.292 --> 03:27.859
Very sad, but so far,
all CGIS's business.

03:27.903 --> 03:29.252
They were here first,

03:29.296 --> 03:30.862
called us when they realized
those crates

03:30.906 --> 03:32.255
in the back are full
of spare parts

03:32.299 --> 03:33.952
for Navy M2 machine guns.

03:33.996 --> 03:35.998
I assume they normally
load these containers

03:36.041 --> 03:37.347
with more than two crates?

03:37.391 --> 03:38.522
Normally.

03:38.566 --> 03:39.915
Hey, Boom-Boom.

03:39.958 --> 03:41.003
Tennant.

03:41.046 --> 03:42.439
CGIS scanned
the container's labels.

03:42.483 --> 03:44.136
It's supposed to be filled
with tractor parts

03:44.180 --> 03:45.616
bound for Myanmar.

03:45.660 --> 03:48.140
No one knows why it was moved
to this holding area.

03:48.184 --> 03:49.446
How long has it been
sitting here?

03:49.490 --> 03:50.447
Two days.

03:50.491 --> 03:51.883
Any idea what we're looking for?

03:51.927 --> 03:53.885
Not unless Gates
just figured it out.

03:53.929 --> 03:55.670
Blood spatter has
a void pattern.

03:55.713 --> 03:58.063
Something was here
when he was murdered.

03:58.107 --> 04:00.892
Now, based on the void,
it had sharp edges.

04:00.936 --> 04:02.416
Was 12 inches longer
and ten inches wider

04:02.459 --> 04:04.156
than the spare parts crate.

04:04.200 --> 04:05.245
Boom-Boom, let's assume

04:05.288 --> 04:07.029
that they might also
have been crates,

04:07.072 --> 04:10.641
potentially weapon-related,
what conclusions can we draw?

04:10.685 --> 04:13.165
They'd be big enough
for heavy guns.

04:13.209 --> 04:14.993
Maybe even RPGs.

04:15.037 --> 04:17.082
Navy would never ship
commercially.

04:17.126 --> 04:20.216
Which means we might be looking
at an illegal arms shipment.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.523
Hey, guys.

04:22.566 --> 04:24.176
I noticed a weird shape

04:24.220 --> 04:26.222
in the shadow
of the top of the container.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.050
Long shot,
but I thought it might be

04:28.093 --> 04:29.399
an errant bullet casing,

04:29.443 --> 04:31.140
so I climbed up there
and took a picture.

04:33.577 --> 04:35.013
What is it?

04:35.057 --> 04:37.277
It's a tracker.

04:37.320 --> 04:38.669
Any idea who it belongs to?

04:38.713 --> 04:41.890
No. I just know it's not RFID,
which is passive.

04:41.933 --> 04:44.066
It's GPS-based,
though not routing

04:44.109 --> 04:45.937
through the usual
satellite constellation,

04:45.981 --> 04:47.591
as far as I can tell.

04:47.635 --> 04:48.853
Meaning?

04:48.897 --> 04:50.812
It's fancy.

04:50.855 --> 04:52.509
I'm limited in what
I can figure out,

04:52.553 --> 04:54.685
since we want to leave it in
place so as to not alert

04:54.729 --> 04:56.470
whoever put it there
that we are on to them.

04:56.513 --> 04:59.211
Our victim doesn't seem like
a sophisticated tracker

04:59.255 --> 05:00.212
kind of guy.

05:00.256 --> 05:01.866
Port inspector
for ten years,

05:01.910 --> 05:02.911
solid performance
reviews.

05:02.954 --> 05:05.130
Divorced last year.

05:05.174 --> 05:06.610
Fellow inspectors said
he complained a lot about

05:06.654 --> 05:08.220
being "divorce poor."

05:08.264 --> 05:10.571
He have the kind of access that
would have allowed him

05:10.614 --> 05:12.573
to move the container
to the holding area?

05:12.616 --> 05:14.357
No, but CGIS is pulling a list

05:14.401 --> 05:16.011
of employees
with those credentials,

05:16.054 --> 05:18.230
as well as info on who accessed
the biometric scanners

05:18.274 --> 05:19.449
at the port last night.

05:19.493 --> 05:21.451
They're gonna share it
when it's in hand.

05:21.495 --> 05:24.193
Lot of reasons folks
steal military weapons,

05:24.236 --> 05:25.890
but Goodrick's dead.

05:25.934 --> 05:29.764
So, if he was involved,
he got double-crossed.

05:29.807 --> 05:32.723
Maybe by whoever put the tracker
on the container.

05:32.767 --> 05:35.030
Ernie, you need to get a bead
on who that was.

05:35.073 --> 05:37.598
I will put on my aluminum hat.

05:38.425 --> 05:39.991
Lucy, stay with Goodrick.

05:40.035 --> 05:42.342
We need to know whether
he's a victim or a perpetrator.

05:42.385 --> 05:43.995
And in either case,
who moved the container

05:44.039 --> 05:46.868
to the holding area and
what was inside when they did?

05:46.911 --> 05:48.870
Check, check and check.

05:48.913 --> 05:50.741
You know I don't have
an aluminum hat.

05:50.785 --> 05:51.873
I know.

05:51.916 --> 05:53.178
I was going to track it using

05:53.222 --> 05:54.571
triangulation software
that I developed.

05:54.615 --> 05:55.964
Because that's what I do.

05:56.007 --> 05:58.401
I develop, uh,
sophisticated technologies

05:58.445 --> 06:00.403
in service of your
crime-fighting.

06:00.447 --> 06:02.536
You know that I think
you're super smart

06:02.579 --> 06:04.842
and amazing, right?

06:24.688 --> 06:25.907
Hi, Tommy.

06:25.950 --> 06:27.648
Hi, Ms. Tennant.

06:27.691 --> 06:28.779
Your dad home?

06:28.823 --> 06:29.998
No, he-he's at work.

06:34.263 --> 06:36.570
He-He's been really busy.

06:36.613 --> 06:39.355
He told me to clean up, I just
haven't really gotten to it yet.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.879
You're not at school.
Are you sick?

06:41.923 --> 06:44.795
Um, a little under the weather.

06:44.839 --> 06:48.233
Can I get you anything?
- Some soup, aspirin?
- No, thank you.

06:48.277 --> 06:49.757
I-I have everything I need.

06:49.800 --> 06:51.193
Okay.

06:51.236 --> 06:54.196
Hey, did your dad change
his number, by chance?

06:54.239 --> 06:56.067
I reached out a couple times
and he hasn't called me back.

06:56.111 --> 06:59.244
No, same number.
Try the hospital.

06:59.288 --> 07:00.463
Okay.

07:00.507 --> 07:02.639
What did you want
to talk to him about?

07:02.683 --> 07:06.904
Just checking in.
Making sure you guys are okay.

07:07.905 --> 07:08.993
Tell your dad I want
to have you guys

07:09.037 --> 07:10.517
over for dinner sometime.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.344
Absolutely.

07:12.388 --> 07:14.869
Well, I'm gonna go
lay on the couch.

07:14.912 --> 07:16.566
Let me take
the trash out for you,

07:16.610 --> 07:18.176
so you don't have to go out.

07:19.308 --> 07:22.529
Uh...

07:22.572 --> 07:25.096
Thanks, Ms. T.

07:25.140 --> 07:26.881
Get some rest,
okay? Feel better.

07:43.245 --> 07:45.595
I assume this isn't
a social call.

07:45.639 --> 07:46.988
Uh, no.

07:47.031 --> 07:48.772
So it's really hard
to track that signal.

07:48.816 --> 07:50.252
Not only is it encrypted

07:50.295 --> 07:52.123
and bouncing off satellites
I don't have access to,

07:52.167 --> 07:54.561
it's also in such a narrow band
of oscillation that...

07:54.604 --> 07:56.301
I love your passion for this.

07:56.345 --> 08:00.175
I don't know who's tracking it,
but I do know where they are.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.048
NCIS!

08:04.092 --> 08:05.746
Hands where we can see them.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.501
DIA got wind of a large
illicit arms shipment

08:21.544 --> 08:22.545
on the <i>Haven Grace,</i>

08:22.589 --> 08:24.373
a ship out
of the Marshall Islands.

08:24.416 --> 08:26.288
So the Navy did
a positive control boarding

08:26.331 --> 08:28.377
with a Coast Guard
law enforcement detachment.

08:28.420 --> 08:30.205
How big is a "large shipment"?

08:30.248 --> 08:31.380
Ten containers' worth.

08:31.423 --> 08:32.990
That's a lot
of weapons.

08:33.034 --> 08:34.078
Where did they come from?

08:34.122 --> 08:35.776
We're not exactly sure,

08:35.819 --> 08:38.561
but there are many legitimate
arms sales from U.S. companies

08:38.605 --> 08:40.302
to foreign governments,
and they're all supervised

08:40.345 --> 08:42.043
and regulated by the DoD.

08:42.086 --> 08:43.479
And sometimes, you know,

08:43.523 --> 08:45.568
these weapons fall
into the wrong hands.

08:45.612 --> 08:47.875
The arms trade
is a $100 billion business.

08:47.918 --> 08:49.180
That much money
motivates people.

08:49.224 --> 08:51.705
Were all the containers
bound for Myanmar,

08:51.748 --> 08:53.054
like the tractor parts?

08:53.097 --> 08:54.838
No. Seven different
destinations.

08:54.882 --> 08:57.972
So your JIA task force put
trackers on all the containers,

08:58.015 --> 08:59.800
let them continue on their way,

08:59.843 --> 09:01.976
thinking it might help you
catch whoever's behind it all?

09:02.019 --> 09:03.412
Yes.

09:03.455 --> 09:04.935
What have the trackers told you?

09:04.979 --> 09:05.893
Four containers

09:05.936 --> 09:07.155
are still in route.

09:07.198 --> 09:08.373
Five reached
their destination ports,

09:08.417 --> 09:10.027
where they sit ignored.

09:10.071 --> 09:12.290
Makes me think the person
who is behind it all

09:12.334 --> 09:14.162
knows that you intercepted
the shipment.

09:14.205 --> 09:15.598
It seems likely at this point.

09:15.642 --> 09:17.339
And the tenth container,

09:17.382 --> 09:18.819
the one sitting out
at the Port of Hawai'i?

09:18.862 --> 09:20.603
Moved by an unknown person
to that location,

09:20.647 --> 09:21.952
ended up a crime scene.

09:21.996 --> 09:23.519
What do you know
about the guy who was killed?

09:23.563 --> 09:25.826
We learned about him
when CGIS discovered him dead.

09:27.001 --> 09:28.872
And so you sat tight,

09:28.916 --> 09:32.659
hoping our murder investigation
would lead to your arms dealer.

09:35.139 --> 09:38.099
It's hard for me
to give a compliment,

09:38.142 --> 09:40.405
but you're all very good
at your jobs.

09:43.887 --> 09:48.109
So, of the five people
who used the biometric scanners

09:48.152 --> 09:50.154
to access that part
of the dock yesterday,

09:50.198 --> 09:52.026
CGIS has spoken to three.

09:52.069 --> 09:53.810
All of them have alibis
for last night.

09:53.854 --> 09:55.377
Any of the five
have the credentials

09:55.420 --> 09:56.726
to change manifest logs?

09:56.770 --> 09:59.599
Yes. Clark Lohan,
who hasn't been reached yet,

09:59.642 --> 10:01.557
and George Burley, who was.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.472
But HDOT did an audit trail.

10:03.515 --> 10:05.866
They feel confident neither
of them were responsible.

10:05.909 --> 10:07.302
I mean, Ernie could have
changed everything

10:07.345 --> 10:08.869
without anyone knowing

10:08.912 --> 10:11.045
and left a little poem for them
to find years later.

10:11.088 --> 10:12.481
Ernie's special.

10:12.524 --> 10:14.483
According to Whistler,
the street value

10:14.526 --> 10:16.877
of those stolen machines guns
and RPGs

10:16.920 --> 10:18.618
is almost $2 million.

10:18.661 --> 10:20.707
I don't know, might have been
worth it to buy an Ernie-type.

10:20.750 --> 10:23.361
Nothing about our dead guy's bio
makes him seem like someone

10:23.405 --> 10:26.147
who'd have the know-how
or the means to do that.

10:26.190 --> 10:28.889
Then maybe Russell Goodrick was
just doing his job last night.

10:28.932 --> 10:31.674
I mean, did he have any reason
to be on that part of the dock?

10:31.718 --> 10:34.677
If he did, he took it
to the grave with him.

10:34.721 --> 10:36.592
You know what else he took
to the grave with him?

10:36.636 --> 10:38.812
The location of his
brand-new pickup truck.

10:38.855 --> 10:40.857
Did he pay cash?

10:40.901 --> 10:42.076
- Yeah.
- Oh, great.

10:42.119 --> 10:43.294
Well, that puts a dent

10:43.338 --> 10:45.253
in my "just doing his job"
argument.

10:45.296 --> 10:46.646
But he's still dead,

10:46.689 --> 10:47.951
which means
the killer's out there,

10:47.995 --> 10:49.997
like Scrooge McDuck,
rolling around in a vault

10:50.040 --> 10:51.389
full of dangerous weapons.

10:51.433 --> 10:53.957
No, no, that is not
what Scrooge McDuck did.

10:54.001 --> 10:56.090
Who the hell
is this McDuck?

10:56.133 --> 10:58.266
Not important.
Let's find the truck,

10:58.309 --> 10:59.615
see if it helps us figure out

10:59.659 --> 11:01.748
who Goodrick's
coconspirators were.

11:02.618 --> 11:05.142
You know, sometimes
I think I should have

11:05.186 --> 11:09.277
spent my childhood surfing less
and watching TV more.

11:09.320 --> 11:10.887
Really?

11:10.931 --> 11:13.498
Nope.

11:15.718 --> 11:17.633
Excuse me, Dr. Frost?

11:17.677 --> 11:20.070
- Margot?
- She's not there, I'm afraid.

11:20.114 --> 11:21.942
Otherwise, she probably
would have stopped me.

11:21.985 --> 11:24.858
I'm sorry, I'm in the middle
of something.

11:24.901 --> 11:27.164
Then I'll try not to take
a lot of your time.

11:27.208 --> 11:29.079
I'm looking
for Dr. Andrew Wilson.

11:29.123 --> 11:30.733
Front desk,
the people in the office

11:30.777 --> 11:31.865
he's supposed
to work at...

11:31.908 --> 11:33.475
they all pointed me to you.

11:33.518 --> 11:35.695
Dr. Wilson no longer works here.

11:35.738 --> 11:38.175
I've realized that.

11:38.219 --> 11:40.395
But do you know
where I can find him?

11:40.438 --> 11:41.875
No.

11:41.918 --> 11:44.529
Could you tell me anything
about why he left?

11:44.573 --> 11:46.401
Look, Ms....

11:46.444 --> 11:48.011
Special Agent Tennant.

11:51.754 --> 11:54.148
I really don't know where he is.

11:54.191 --> 11:57.020
But you know
more than you're saying.

11:58.021 --> 12:00.589
We let him go two months ago.

12:00.632 --> 12:02.504
It just wasn't working out.

12:02.547 --> 12:03.897
Well,

12:03.940 --> 12:07.117
there's no law
against firing people for cause.

12:07.161 --> 12:08.379
I'm guessing

12:08.423 --> 12:09.641
"just wasn't working out"

12:09.685 --> 12:10.947
doesn't quite cover
what happened.

12:13.863 --> 12:15.735
Look...

12:17.519 --> 12:19.695
...let me make this easy
for you.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.088
We both know
that if he left a sponge

12:21.131 --> 12:22.437
inside of a patient
or something,

12:22.480 --> 12:24.265
that's actionable malpractice.

12:24.308 --> 12:25.701
Probably be public record.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.443
If he violated employment law,

12:28.486 --> 12:30.532
you'd say,
"It's a personnel matter,"

12:30.575 --> 12:32.142
because that's
confidential.

12:32.186 --> 12:34.623
But your unwillingness
to tell me anything

12:34.666 --> 12:36.016
makes me think
it's something the hospital

12:36.059 --> 12:38.670
doesn't want people
to know about.

12:41.151 --> 12:44.720
We were unable to find
some fentanyl.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.897
We couldn't prove Dr. Wilson
was responsible,

12:47.941 --> 12:49.812
but we had
our suspicions.

12:49.856 --> 12:51.509
He failed a drug test.

12:52.859 --> 12:54.774
That's a personnel matter.

12:56.297 --> 12:58.255
I'm afraid I'm unable to say.

13:04.566 --> 13:07.264
Hey. Back from being a superspy?

13:07.308 --> 13:09.614
Not a superspy. Not even a spy.

13:09.658 --> 13:11.747
Just a smart, sexy woman

13:11.791 --> 13:13.618
sitting in a warehouse,
trying to save the world

13:13.662 --> 13:15.707
from evil men
stealing big weapons.

13:15.751 --> 13:17.884
That is a lot to put
on a business card.

13:17.927 --> 13:19.929
Hey, I, um...

13:19.973 --> 13:22.323
I made dinner reservations.

13:22.366 --> 13:23.759
Oh.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.630
Look, I know, I know,
I know you're nervous

13:25.674 --> 13:27.502
about people at work
finding out about us,

13:27.545 --> 13:30.200
but I will be shocked
if anyone we've ever met

13:30.244 --> 13:31.245
is at this restaurant.

13:31.288 --> 13:33.029
That's because it's fancy,
right?

13:33.073 --> 13:35.118
Not 'cause it's gross?
Yes.

13:35.162 --> 13:36.946
Um...

13:36.990 --> 13:38.861
Willing to give it a try.

13:38.905 --> 13:40.123
Great. Good.

13:40.167 --> 13:41.908
Because after, I thought...

13:41.951 --> 13:43.344
Oh.

13:44.911 --> 13:48.436
More later.
Looks like my BOLO came through.

13:55.182 --> 13:56.357
Nice truck.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.359
What's it doing out here?

13:58.402 --> 14:00.883
Long way to the port.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.626
Nothing here.

14:07.368 --> 14:09.370
Jesse.

14:15.289 --> 14:17.508
What's under the blanket?

14:32.175 --> 14:33.394
Well, the good news is,

14:33.437 --> 14:35.570
it's not a body.

14:50.977 --> 14:52.413
Andy?

14:53.762 --> 14:54.981
Jane.

14:55.024 --> 14:57.766
How funny to run
into you down here.

14:58.636 --> 15:00.421
It's not an accident,
I'm afraid.

15:00.464 --> 15:02.075
Excuse me?

15:02.118 --> 15:04.816
Tommy used your tablet at home
to locate your phone.

15:04.860 --> 15:07.732
Just in case you were wondering,
he wasn't happy about it.

15:07.776 --> 15:10.518
I made it clear
he had no choice.

15:10.561 --> 15:13.390
I don't understand
why you needed to find me.

15:17.090 --> 15:18.961
This isn't easy for me, Andy.

15:19.005 --> 15:21.572
Our kids have been
friends a long time.

15:21.616 --> 15:23.444
But you know the drill.

15:23.487 --> 15:26.316
You used to be
a mandatory reporter, too.

15:26.360 --> 15:27.970
Hey, Tommy's fine.

15:28.014 --> 15:29.972
No. He's not.

15:30.016 --> 15:32.105
And neither are you.

15:32.148 --> 15:34.194
Look, Jane, I don't need
to be lectured...

15:34.237 --> 15:35.978
I went to the hospital, Andy.

15:38.111 --> 15:40.852
So you know they're not gonna
give me my job back.

15:40.896 --> 15:42.811
I'm not here because
you're unemployed.

15:42.854 --> 15:44.682
I'm here because
you have a drug problem

15:44.726 --> 15:45.814
that is affecting your son,

15:45.857 --> 15:47.207
and I have
a legal responsibility

15:47.250 --> 15:48.251
to do something about it.

15:48.295 --> 15:49.992
I told you, Tommy is fine.

15:50.036 --> 15:51.037
You can say that
as much as you want,

15:51.080 --> 15:53.996
but it doesn't make it true.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.955
You have until
tomorrow to call Romi

15:55.998 --> 15:57.173
and tell her
what's going on.

15:57.217 --> 15:59.349
Otherwise I will go
to the authorities.

16:01.047 --> 16:04.528
Tommy's welcome to stay with us
while you figure things out.

16:14.756 --> 16:16.671
Where do I put them
when he's done?

16:16.714 --> 16:18.978
On ice in a cooler
in the evidence room

16:19.021 --> 16:20.370
until we don't need them
anymore.

16:20.414 --> 16:23.025
Then to AFMES,
where they get a nice drawer.

16:23.069 --> 16:26.681
I had a case in Lejeune where
parts turned up a few at a time.

16:26.724 --> 16:27.899
Coroner kept putting them
in separate drawers

16:27.943 --> 16:29.336
until he ran out of space.

16:29.379 --> 16:31.120
Then he realized

16:31.164 --> 16:32.774
it was more fun
to put them together.

16:32.817 --> 16:36.125
Like a jigsaw puzzle.

16:36.169 --> 16:37.735
Worst one ever.

16:37.779 --> 16:41.870
I had a murder in D.C. where
the killer cut the body apart,

16:41.913 --> 16:43.524
but with a dull-bladed saw.

16:43.567 --> 16:45.178
I mean, it flicked bits all over

16:45.221 --> 16:46.483
his garage.

16:46.527 --> 16:48.877
We never found the body,
but we got a conviction

16:48.920 --> 16:51.358
because of chunks that were
found in between two cabinets.

16:51.401 --> 16:53.012
Yeah, but cleanup
- always gets them.
- Yeah.

16:53.055 --> 16:55.057
Idiots think they just need to
splash a little bleach around.

16:55.101 --> 16:56.885
You got to scrub the cracks
with a toothbrush.

16:56.928 --> 16:58.147
And degreaser.

16:58.191 --> 16:59.975
They never remember
to use the degreaser.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.324
Exactly. I remember this case
during the heat wave of...

17:01.368 --> 17:03.718
Okay, that's enough.

17:03.761 --> 17:06.503
Oh, suddenly you're squeamish?

17:06.547 --> 17:08.462
No, no, I am not squeamish.

17:08.505 --> 17:10.203
I just don't need
more visual images

17:10.246 --> 17:12.074
to go with the ones
I've already got filed.

17:12.118 --> 17:13.771
Yeah, fair enough.

17:13.815 --> 17:16.557
We all got to be able
to sleep at night.

17:17.775 --> 17:19.560
Positive I.D.

17:22.389 --> 17:24.173
Fingers belong
to Clark Lohan,

17:24.217 --> 17:26.871
a terminal planner
for the Honolulu Harbor.

17:26.915 --> 17:28.438
He was on Kai's list
of folks who accessed

17:28.482 --> 17:30.005
the dock last night.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.180
All of him?

17:31.224 --> 17:32.921
It was just a list.

17:32.964 --> 17:36.751
I guess we better find out.

17:38.535 --> 17:40.233
Fingers crossed.

17:48.023 --> 17:50.243
Something went down in there.

17:51.331 --> 17:52.941
Should we do a wellness check?

18:00.427 --> 18:01.645
Clark Lohan?

18:14.571 --> 18:16.530
Clark Lohan, NCIS!

18:24.277 --> 18:26.757
Clark Lohan? NCIS.

18:34.591 --> 18:36.115
Lucy?

18:36.158 --> 18:37.681
You got him?

18:38.639 --> 18:40.858
Almost positive.

18:52.566 --> 18:55.960
Paramedics are on
their way. Who did this to you?

18:56.004 --> 18:58.224
Russell Goodrick, from DOT.

18:58.267 --> 19:00.661
But it-it wasn't
his idea.

19:00.704 --> 19:03.707
There was another guy.
He was in charge.

19:03.751 --> 19:05.100
You know who he was?

19:05.144 --> 19:06.188
No.

19:06.232 --> 19:07.885
Did Russell mention his name?

19:07.929 --> 19:10.149
I don't remember.

19:10.192 --> 19:11.759
What did he look like?

19:11.802 --> 19:14.327
He was tall...

19:15.197 --> 19:17.068
...muscly and had
a shaved head.

19:17.112 --> 19:19.636
They said they were gonna
come back and kill me.

19:19.680 --> 19:22.030
Thank God you found me first.

19:29.037 --> 19:30.430
Put some pressure on it, okay?

19:30.473 --> 19:31.909
Okay.

19:31.953 --> 19:34.651
What time did, uh, Russell
and the other guy show up?

19:34.695 --> 19:37.480
That was a-after dinner.

19:37.524 --> 19:40.222
They wanted me to take them
down to the dock.

19:40.266 --> 19:45.009
And I said no.
They cut off my fingers.

19:46.272 --> 19:48.143
How did you know I was here?
I was s-screaming,

19:48.187 --> 19:51.015
but I didn't think
anybody could hear me.

19:51.842 --> 19:52.843
Uh, we didn't.

19:52.887 --> 19:55.846
We found your fingers.

19:56.978 --> 19:59.459
Can a doctor put them back on?

20:01.374 --> 20:02.940
Uh, I don't know.

20:02.984 --> 20:04.290
They weren't on ice.

20:04.333 --> 20:05.726
But you should,
you should talk

20:05.769 --> 20:07.554
to the folks at the hospital.

20:08.468 --> 20:09.991
You changed
the manifest

20:10.034 --> 20:12.907
on a container at the port,
didn't you?

20:12.950 --> 20:16.650
The tall one said he was gonna
kill me unless I helped him.

20:16.693 --> 20:19.130
He said it was the only thing
that I had to do.

20:19.174 --> 20:21.481
And I didn't think
they were coming back.

20:22.351 --> 20:24.266
Why didn't you call the police?

20:25.441 --> 20:26.921
I was scared.

20:26.964 --> 20:29.184
I should have called the police.

20:30.403 --> 20:33.101
I don't feel good.

20:33.928 --> 20:35.277
I'll see if the ambulance
is here.

20:35.321 --> 20:37.236
Hey, no, no, no, w-why don't you

20:37.279 --> 20:38.976
just stay in the chair for now?

20:40.717 --> 20:42.806
Russell was my friend.

20:42.850 --> 20:44.417
I can't believe
he would be involved

20:44.460 --> 20:46.723
with people who would do
something like this.

20:46.767 --> 20:50.074
You never know
what people are capable of.

20:50.118 --> 20:52.599
I guess not.

20:56.820 --> 20:59.214
I know I'm gonna have
to call social services

20:59.258 --> 21:00.911
if he doesn't do
the right thing, but...

21:00.955 --> 21:02.913
Alex won't be happy.

21:02.957 --> 21:06.569
I think we're in a world where
happy is almost impossible.

21:06.613 --> 21:08.049
I-I think about this a lot.

21:08.092 --> 21:10.269
I mean, about how being
a mandatory reporter

21:10.312 --> 21:12.271
is gonna affect
my relationship with my kids.

21:12.314 --> 21:14.360
I mean, how much will my
daughters want to share with me

21:14.403 --> 21:16.579
when they know I can
put folks in jail?

21:16.623 --> 21:18.625
I think they'll be smart enough
to know that you can't put

21:18.668 --> 21:21.584
their boyfriends in jail just
for being their boyfriends.

21:21.628 --> 21:22.759
I can't?

21:25.893 --> 21:29.853
Ernie just confirmed for DOT
that Lohan changed the manifest.

21:29.897 --> 21:31.551
Used something
called steganography

21:31.594 --> 21:33.379
to keep it from being
noticed by the other techs.

21:33.422 --> 21:35.598
Another thing
I got to worry about.

21:35.642 --> 21:37.121
Well, the good thing about this,

21:37.165 --> 21:38.688
unlike the future boyfriends
of your daughters,

21:38.732 --> 21:40.864
you won't know it's there.

21:40.908 --> 21:42.083
What do you have, Kai?

21:42.126 --> 21:43.476
HPD gave us the list

21:43.519 --> 21:44.868
of local folks they thought
might be involved

21:44.912 --> 21:46.435
in the container shipment.

21:46.479 --> 21:49.438
Now, based on the nature of
the weapons that were offloaded

21:49.482 --> 21:52.485
and Clark's
somewhat vague description,

21:52.528 --> 21:54.051
one name floated to the top.

21:54.878 --> 21:57.272
Jason Roberts.

21:57.316 --> 21:58.969
Tall, muscular,
shaved head.

21:59.013 --> 22:00.449
Dishonorably discharged

22:00.493 --> 22:02.799
almost immediately
after he finished basic training

22:02.843 --> 22:03.974
for assaulting a bunkmate.

22:04.018 --> 22:05.933
And he was arrested

22:05.976 --> 22:07.587
five years ago
for trying to sell an M2

22:07.630 --> 22:09.632
to an undercover FBI agent.

22:09.676 --> 22:11.417
Why is he not in jail?

22:11.460 --> 22:12.940
He got to plead
to a lesser charge

22:12.983 --> 22:14.115
when he flipped
on a coconspirator.

22:14.158 --> 22:16.247
So in addition to being tall,

22:16.291 --> 22:18.249
he seems like a stand-up guy.

22:18.293 --> 22:20.164
- Do we know how to find him?
- Yeah.

22:20.208 --> 22:22.166
Let's grab Boom-Boom
and go get our weapons.

22:22.210 --> 22:24.299
Call when you have
Roberts in hand.

22:26.170 --> 22:28.172
Why am I the only one
in the entire building

22:28.216 --> 22:29.652
that doesn't get
to call him that?

22:29.696 --> 22:31.480
Just need more bonding time.

22:31.524 --> 22:33.177
Bonding time?

22:46.713 --> 22:48.584
Tommy called me.

22:52.936 --> 22:55.461
His mom's coming
from Phoenix to get him.

22:57.419 --> 22:58.942
I'm sorry.

23:01.815 --> 23:03.425
What did you do?

23:05.253 --> 23:07.603
I can't talk about it, Alex.

23:07.647 --> 23:10.171
If Tommy knows and wants
to share, he can, but-- hey.

23:10.214 --> 23:11.694
It's not my story to tell.

23:11.738 --> 23:13.130
I asked you to help him.

23:13.174 --> 23:14.741
I know, and I hope I did.

23:14.784 --> 23:16.046
Not the right way!

23:16.090 --> 23:18.527
I didn't have a choice,
sweetheart.

23:20.703 --> 23:21.704
Alex.

23:26.709 --> 23:28.276
There's only one way in.

23:28.319 --> 23:29.016
It's hard for us

23:29.059 --> 23:30.409
to arrive discreetly.

23:30.452 --> 23:32.236
And no place for our arms
dealer to run.

23:32.280 --> 23:34.325
Hopefully he's smart enough
to know that.

23:34.369 --> 23:36.371
Just FYI,
if you find the weapons,

23:36.415 --> 23:38.808
please don't open all the crates
and start moving the inventory.

23:39.940 --> 23:42.464
- That's what you're focused on?
- You brought me here

23:42.508 --> 23:44.466
because I know what to do with
the contraband, right?

23:44.510 --> 23:46.207
Yes.

23:46.250 --> 23:48.470
Well, you're my ride back,
so don't slow me down.

23:48.514 --> 23:51.560
You know, I do respect how you
don't care if people like you.

23:52.648 --> 23:54.128
Who doesn't like me?

23:56.347 --> 23:58.001
Nobody. No...

23:59.873 --> 24:01.396
Let's go.
Yeah.

24:16.933 --> 24:18.282
Hey, you see that?

24:18.326 --> 24:20.328
What?

24:21.329 --> 24:23.723
Move, move, move!

24:30.730 --> 24:32.775
How many of those does he have?

24:32.819 --> 24:34.777
Based on the inventory,
he'd have 12.

24:34.821 --> 24:35.996
Well, how about we stop him

24:36.039 --> 24:37.476
before he shoots
all of them at us?

24:37.519 --> 24:38.694
Hey, I hate to talk
this to death,

24:38.738 --> 24:40.391
but I vote
for an indirect approach.

24:40.435 --> 24:41.262
Modified Fabian?

24:41.305 --> 24:42.481
That's what I was thinking.

24:42.524 --> 24:43.394
Meaning?

24:43.438 --> 24:45.353
Let's sneak around behind him.

24:45.396 --> 24:46.963
Won't he see us coming?

24:47.007 --> 24:47.964
- Kai.
- Yeah?

24:48.008 --> 24:49.662
Propane tank.

24:54.754 --> 24:56.669
Good idea, Boom-Boom.

25:06.896 --> 25:07.767
NCIS!

25:07.810 --> 25:09.377
Put it down!

25:18.560 --> 25:19.692
Thank you.

25:20.954 --> 25:23.783
That would've hurt.

25:27.569 --> 25:30.180
I called you Boom-Boom back
there. I'm sorry about that.

25:30.224 --> 25:32.052
It's all good.

25:39.886 --> 25:43.019
Roberts is dead.
Boom-Boom, Kai and I aren't,

25:43.063 --> 25:45.718
despite the dude
launching some rockets at us.

25:45.761 --> 25:47.415
- Ouch.
- Yeah.

25:47.458 --> 25:52.463
We, uh, we did a modified
Fabian, worked out all right.

25:52.507 --> 25:53.508
And the weapons?

25:53.552 --> 25:55.510
Looks like everything's here.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.991
Any idea who Roberts
is working for?

25:58.034 --> 25:59.906
We're grabbing all the papers
from his office.

25:59.949 --> 26:02.256
Ernie's on his finances
and digital records.

26:02.299 --> 26:05.651
So, if there's something
to be found, we'll find it.

26:05.694 --> 26:08.828
Good. I'm glad you guys
are okay.

26:11.744 --> 26:15.661
♪ What am I to you?

26:15.704 --> 26:18.315
You're right. I don't, uh...

26:18.359 --> 26:19.839
I don't recognize anyone.

26:19.882 --> 26:22.842
Mm. You have
to know somebody to get in.

26:22.885 --> 26:24.583
Oh, who do you know?

26:24.626 --> 26:26.062
Chef Dax.

26:27.716 --> 26:29.413
He did the same thing
back in Dallas.

26:29.457 --> 26:31.851
He takes over restaurants on
the nights that they're closed,

26:31.894 --> 26:34.897
and he matches the food
to the place.

26:34.941 --> 26:37.552
So, tonight we're having...

26:37.596 --> 26:39.467
I'm guessing Pan-Asian seafood,

26:39.510 --> 26:42.470
but that's-that's only based
on the big fish on the walls

26:42.513 --> 26:44.385
and the soy sauce on the tables.

26:47.431 --> 26:49.956
Hey, um...

26:50.739 --> 26:52.219
...thank you

26:52.262 --> 26:55.352
for caring about
how I feel about all this.

27:03.230 --> 27:05.841
I very much care.

27:07.103 --> 27:10.629
But I think, uh,
maybe next time...

27:13.240 --> 27:15.677
...we could go
to a regular restaurant.

27:16.591 --> 27:18.637
Where someone could see us?

27:23.642 --> 27:25.208
Wow.

27:28.559 --> 27:31.388
I'm super excited about that.

27:35.044 --> 27:37.699
Um...

27:37.743 --> 27:40.006
Okay.

27:40.049 --> 27:41.834
In the interest
of full disclosure,

27:41.877 --> 27:43.749
I feel like I
should tell you,

27:43.792 --> 27:46.708
I'm almost certain everyone in
my office knows what's going on.

27:46.752 --> 27:49.450
But they're on my side,

27:49.493 --> 27:51.974
so they'll pretend they don't.

27:53.802 --> 27:56.457
Well, then, I'm, uh...

27:56.500 --> 27:58.459
I'm awfully glad that I'm...

27:58.502 --> 28:01.157
I'm feeling more comfortable
with things.

28:02.985 --> 28:05.161
Hey.

28:05.205 --> 28:09.644
Congrats on getting
all those weapons back.

28:09.688 --> 28:13.387
In retrospect,
seems inevitable.

28:14.605 --> 28:16.520
Why, because there's no market
for black-market RPGs

28:16.564 --> 28:20.307
on a fairly small island
with a giant military presence?

28:20.350 --> 28:22.048
Yeah, there's that, uh...

28:22.091 --> 28:25.138
it's just, mm, it's also
the stupidity of the plan.

28:25.181 --> 28:27.967
I mean, why did Roberts kill
Goodrick but leave Lohan alive?

28:28.010 --> 28:29.969
Did he think
that he would bleed to death?

28:30.012 --> 28:32.493
Only if he skipped an entire
semester of high school biology.

28:32.536 --> 28:35.148
Yeah.

28:38.891 --> 28:42.329
Actually, you know,
now that you say that...

28:42.372 --> 28:45.506
when we found Lohan,
there was a shower curtain

28:45.549 --> 28:47.856
underneath the chair
where he was being held.

28:47.900 --> 28:49.423
To keep the floor clean.

28:49.466 --> 28:50.598
Yeah, but only necessary

28:50.641 --> 28:52.121
if you plan to kill him

28:52.165 --> 28:54.602
and move the body to hide
the location of the murder.

28:54.645 --> 28:56.256
And if that was your plan,

28:56.299 --> 28:58.867
you wouldn't forget to circle
- back and finish the job.
- No.

29:00.303 --> 29:03.219
Goodrick and Roberts
are dead pawns.

29:03.263 --> 29:04.830
Clark Lohan's in charge.

29:04.873 --> 29:07.746
And he cut off his own fingers
so we wouldn't suspect him.

29:08.659 --> 29:10.183
And it worked.

29:11.575 --> 29:13.360
Excuse me.

29:13.403 --> 29:15.057
Cutting off my own fingers

29:15.101 --> 29:17.277
is a level of commitment
I am not capable of.

29:17.320 --> 29:19.845
He might have had one
of the other guys do it.

29:19.888 --> 29:21.890
Sure, but no.

29:21.934 --> 29:26.199
How would I work my magic?
No F, no R, no five?

29:26.242 --> 29:28.418
Jesse and Kai are headed to
look for Lohan at the hospital.

29:28.462 --> 29:29.898
Though I'm guessing
he's already gone.

29:29.942 --> 29:31.944
So, tell me what
his next move might be.

29:31.987 --> 29:33.293
Well, there's no evidence

29:33.336 --> 29:34.860
Lohan is an international
arms dealer,

29:34.903 --> 29:36.513
but he worked really hard
to throw suspicion

29:36.557 --> 29:39.299
off of himself
and onto Goodrick and Roberts.

29:39.342 --> 29:41.040
We've realized that he moved
the container

29:41.083 --> 29:42.737
but let Roberts
steal the contents.

29:42.781 --> 29:45.087
Maybe the container itself
was what's important.

29:45.131 --> 29:46.610
Like, maybe,

29:46.654 --> 29:49.091
it was built out of some sort
of radioactive material.

29:49.135 --> 29:49.962
Interesting.

29:50.005 --> 29:51.746
Obviously,
that isn't it.

29:51.790 --> 29:54.836
Radiation detectors installed
after Fukushima are still here,

29:54.880 --> 29:56.969
Coast Guard uses them
all over the docks.

29:57.012 --> 29:59.623
A meaningful amount of radiation
would trigger something.

29:59.667 --> 30:01.277
Okay, so it's not the container?

30:01.321 --> 30:03.062
No, no, it definitely is.

30:03.105 --> 30:05.194
Ernie-Ernie used
- a CAD/
- CAM program

30:05.238 --> 30:07.240
to analyze the
crime scene photos.

30:07.283 --> 30:09.155
Turns out the inside
of the container

30:09.198 --> 30:11.157
is six inches shorter
than the outside.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.942
Too small a discrepancy
for the human brain to hold.

30:13.986 --> 30:15.552
We know what might
be hidden back there?

30:15.596 --> 30:16.684
No idea.

30:17.598 --> 30:19.469
Get Whistler, figure it out.

30:19.513 --> 30:21.950
Lucy, head to the port.
I'll have CGIS meet you there.

30:23.169 --> 30:24.910
Clark Lohan orchestrated
the deaths of two people

30:24.953 --> 30:26.259
to get whatever's hidden there.

30:26.302 --> 30:28.391
Must be worth it.

30:49.064 --> 30:51.414
It's already gone.

31:02.251 --> 31:03.426
A DVD?

31:03.470 --> 31:05.776
A list compiled by DoD
of all the weapons

31:05.820 --> 31:07.691
and weapons systems that have
been misplaced or stolen

31:07.735 --> 31:09.128
in the last six months.

31:09.171 --> 31:11.173
Couldn't find a mimeo machine
to make a copy with?

31:12.087 --> 31:14.220
I thought it would be faster

31:14.263 --> 31:15.699
than taking the time
to make a secure link

31:15.743 --> 31:16.918
to send the file to you.

31:16.962 --> 31:19.442
It's fine. I'm prepared
for all kinds of data.

31:19.486 --> 31:23.098
You bring me a Betamax tape,
I'm ready.

31:25.361 --> 31:27.581
Okay, thanks.
Last confirmed sighting of Lohan

31:27.624 --> 31:29.931
is two hours ago,
when a nurse checked his vitals.

31:29.975 --> 31:33.413
20 minutes to the dock,
45 to weld open the wall.

31:33.456 --> 31:35.415
He's 55 minutes ahead of us.

31:35.458 --> 31:38.026
We've alerted TSA and HSI
to watch the airports,

31:38.070 --> 31:40.376
but there are no flights
departing HNL until the morning,

31:40.420 --> 31:43.249
so that's probably not
his exit strategy.

31:43.292 --> 31:44.772
I mean, this guy's smart.

31:44.815 --> 31:46.382
He knows as soon as the hospital
sees he's missing,

31:46.426 --> 31:47.775
we're gonna find out.

31:47.818 --> 31:49.429
Yeah, but he waited
to leave the hospital

31:49.472 --> 31:50.778
until we cleared
the crime scene.

31:50.821 --> 31:52.606
He's thinking
all of this through,

31:52.649 --> 31:55.174
so he has to have a plan to get
himself off the island

31:55.217 --> 31:58.525
or just get <i>it</i> off the islands.

31:58.568 --> 32:02.094
Do we have any idea what it is?

32:02.137 --> 32:04.531
Eliminating things
that are too big...

32:05.314 --> 32:07.142
...loses 80 objects.

32:07.186 --> 32:09.797
How do you guys lose
so many things?

32:09.840 --> 32:12.321
The DoD doesn't lose them.

32:12.365 --> 32:13.844
It happens to have
many, many things,

32:13.888 --> 32:16.325
some of which other people
steal or lose.

32:18.849 --> 32:21.287
Anyway, there are still
50 to choose from.

32:21.330 --> 32:23.680
It's not regular ordnance.

32:24.681 --> 32:26.074
Eighteen.

32:26.118 --> 32:27.206
And based on its size,
the power source

32:27.249 --> 32:28.642
is either small or external.

32:28.685 --> 32:30.600
Eleven.

32:33.038 --> 32:34.387
A guy cut off his own fingers.

32:34.430 --> 32:36.606
You don't do that for
a run-of-the-mill weapon.

32:36.650 --> 32:39.131
You can steal anything
and net a million dollars.

32:39.174 --> 32:40.871
- No, you can't.
- Yes, you can.

32:40.915 --> 32:43.874
But this is special.
It's one of a kind.

32:48.705 --> 32:49.793
Bingo.

32:49.837 --> 32:51.839
Best guess
is that it's a prototype

32:51.882 --> 32:53.449
of a top secret
laser-guidance system

32:53.493 --> 32:56.017
that disappeared from a
lab a couple months ago.

32:56.061 --> 32:58.672
The developer insisted that
it was accidentally destroyed,

32:58.715 --> 33:01.153
and there's no chatter
about it being for sale

33:01.196 --> 33:03.198
to prove that
they were wrong.

33:03.242 --> 33:04.634
How much is it worth
on the black market?

33:04.678 --> 33:07.986
Well, ten years of R&D,
fully functional,

33:08.029 --> 33:09.900
but not production-ready...

33:09.944 --> 33:11.076
- 15 million.
- Ten million.

33:12.947 --> 33:16.037
I have no idea. But a lot.

33:16.081 --> 33:18.518
High-value target
limits the buyers,

33:18.561 --> 33:20.520
probably also limits
the sellers.

33:20.563 --> 33:22.696
I had Interpol send me
their database

33:22.739 --> 33:25.264
of suspected arms dealers
and known associates,

33:25.307 --> 33:27.570
hoping to get a point of contact
between one of them

33:27.614 --> 33:28.571
and Clark Lohan.

33:28.615 --> 33:30.443
I didn't, but
considering

33:30.486 --> 33:32.097
how hot Lohan
is right now,

33:32.140 --> 33:33.837
his best play might be
to lay low

33:33.881 --> 33:35.535
and have the buyer come to him.

33:35.578 --> 33:37.972
Good thought.

33:38.016 --> 33:41.019
These guys would be
on the HSI watch list, right?

33:41.062 --> 33:42.542
Yep.

33:43.717 --> 33:45.240
Viktor Ivanov.

33:45.284 --> 33:48.069
He landed in Kona on the first
flight this morning.

33:48.113 --> 33:49.810
Find him.

33:50.680 --> 33:52.117
Now.

34:12.050 --> 34:15.836
Jesse, Lucy, Viktor Ivanov is in the bar.

34:15.879 --> 34:18.143
No sign of Clark Lohan,

34:18.186 --> 34:20.101
so the two of you keep
laying low. We don't want him

34:20.145 --> 34:22.495
to see you and recognize you
from the house.

34:22.538 --> 34:24.801
I regret being so nice to him.

34:24.845 --> 34:27.152
Don't let him change
who you are, Agent Tara.

34:27.195 --> 34:28.675
Besides, what's your option?

34:28.718 --> 34:30.894
Poke his wounds, make him cry?

34:32.026 --> 34:34.115
Heads up.
Lohan's about to walk in.

34:34.159 --> 34:36.335
Okay, nobody move until
we're sure the backpack

34:36.378 --> 34:37.336
has the device in it,

34:37.379 --> 34:38.772
and give them both a chance

34:38.815 --> 34:41.949
to get clear of the civilians
before we arrest them.

34:53.961 --> 34:56.964
I can't see what it is.

35:10.325 --> 35:11.848
It's a security token.

35:11.892 --> 35:13.459
That's the money transfer.

35:29.170 --> 35:30.519
Transfer's done.

35:30.563 --> 35:32.434
Lucy, Jesse, get ready.

35:35.829 --> 35:38.571
Ivanov's heading out the back,
Lohan is heading out the front.

35:38.614 --> 35:39.833
Jesse, help Kai.

35:39.876 --> 35:41.661
Lucy and Agent Reyes,
stay with Lohan.

35:41.704 --> 35:44.272
Try not to let him
destroy that token.

35:53.586 --> 35:55.240
Viktor Ivanov.

35:55.283 --> 35:56.806
NCIS.

35:56.850 --> 35:58.068
Put the bag down.

35:58.112 --> 35:59.505
Raise your hands
where I can see them.

36:02.943 --> 36:04.510
Jesse, Kai's in trouble.

36:15.390 --> 36:16.565
I'm good. You go!

36:21.353 --> 36:22.658
Clark, NCIS.

36:22.702 --> 36:24.660
Let's put all eight fingers
on top of the car.

36:24.704 --> 36:26.923
Nice and easy.

36:33.452 --> 36:35.889
Gonna make a great story
in prison.

36:52.384 --> 36:54.124
Fabian!

36:57.258 --> 37:00.174
What-what the hell
does that mean?

37:13.666 --> 37:16.930
Who knew ancient Roman strategy
was so handy?

37:17.974 --> 37:20.020
I did my research.

37:20.760 --> 37:22.979
Great job, everyone.

37:26.461 --> 37:29.725
But you think Tommy's
gonna be okay?

37:29.769 --> 37:33.076
I think so. I hope so.

37:33.120 --> 37:35.427
Then you did the right thing.

37:35.470 --> 37:37.298
I know, but...

37:37.342 --> 37:39.909
this isn't the way
I wanted it to go.

37:39.953 --> 37:43.478
I'm worried
it might make Alex

37:43.522 --> 37:48.222
more reluctant to come to me
with his own problems.

37:49.789 --> 37:52.270
Look, I know there's a lot
going on at your house,

37:52.313 --> 37:53.575
and the baby's
only a month away...

37:53.619 --> 37:56.274
Hey, I'm always there
for my son, okay?

37:56.317 --> 37:59.451
I'm not here
to pick a fight, Daniel.

38:01.235 --> 38:03.585
I'm here because I'm nervous.

38:05.195 --> 38:09.852
He's hurt and he's really,
really mad at me.

38:12.812 --> 38:16.337
I just need to know that
you're gonna keep an eye out,

38:16.381 --> 38:18.557
through the sleep deprivation

38:18.600 --> 38:20.515
and the feedings
and the diapers.

38:20.559 --> 38:22.212
You didn't come to pick a fight,
you just came

38:22.256 --> 38:23.866
to make me regret
my life decisions.

38:23.910 --> 38:26.782
No.

38:29.524 --> 38:30.917
No.

38:32.484 --> 38:36.749
I just want Alex to know
that he has someone to turn to.

38:38.403 --> 38:41.231
Look, Janie,

38:41.275 --> 38:44.191
Alex talks to me about
all sorts of things--

38:44.234 --> 38:46.149
girls,
getting invited to parties

38:46.193 --> 38:49.109
he's not sure he should go to--
but he brought this to you.

38:49.152 --> 38:50.763
Lucky me.

38:50.806 --> 38:52.112
Which means, he
thought you were

38:52.155 --> 38:53.853
the right person
to handle it.

38:53.896 --> 38:56.856
He might not have known
what you were gonna do exactly,

38:56.899 --> 39:00.990
but he's a smart kid,
he knew enough.

39:05.734 --> 39:07.910
How long you think
he's gonna be mad at me?

39:09.869 --> 39:12.175
Remember in sixth grade,
when he wanted a phone

39:12.219 --> 39:13.351
and we wouldn't
let him have one?

39:13.394 --> 39:15.701
- Yes.
- Longer than that.

39:17.442 --> 39:19.748
But he'll come around.
He loves you.

39:19.792 --> 39:22.534
Even though he doesn't say it
often enough.

39:25.711 --> 39:27.930
You get the fancy sign
when Palakiko

39:27.974 --> 39:29.454
got recruited to the S.E.C.?

39:29.497 --> 39:31.499
Kid's a wall on
the offensive line.

39:31.543 --> 39:32.805
- He's gonna play on Sundays.
- Mm-hmm.

39:32.848 --> 39:34.459
And you're gonna park
close to the gym.

39:34.502 --> 39:38.071
Everyone wins. Hey.

39:38.114 --> 39:41.117
Everything's gonna be okay.

39:41.161 --> 39:42.902
Have a nice evening, Jane.

39:43.903 --> 39:45.295
You, too, Daniel.

40:07.753 --> 40:10.016
- How long you been here?
- Not long.

40:10.059 --> 40:13.193
I just came by to put the
guidance system in the vault

40:13.236 --> 40:16.588
until someone comes to
get it from the mainland.

40:17.197 --> 40:19.025
How much food
do you bring for lunch?

40:19.068 --> 40:22.376
Oh, it's not food. Fingers.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.465
I'm, uh, I'm taking it
to AFMES,

40:24.509 --> 40:28.208
mostly so they're
not here anymore.

40:28.251 --> 40:29.731
Do you want to walk with me?

40:29.775 --> 40:32.517
We can circle by your office
and pick up your stuff.

40:32.560 --> 40:34.388
Okay.

40:34.432 --> 40:37.173
Then maybe we go celebrate?

40:37.217 --> 40:38.392
Do you want to go
to that restaurant

40:38.436 --> 40:40.438
and actually try the food
this time?

40:41.787 --> 40:43.919
No.

41:09.771 --> 41:12.165
Did Tommy already leave?

41:13.166 --> 41:14.820
Yeah.

41:20.434 --> 41:22.915
I'm really sorry, Alex.

41:22.958 --> 41:25.439
About everything that happened.

41:32.446 --> 41:35.710
If Tommy plays baseball
at his new school,

41:35.754 --> 41:38.234
his team is called
the Sand Lizards.

41:41.847 --> 41:44.806
Are Sand Lizards fierce?

41:45.590 --> 41:46.895
I don't know.

41:46.939 --> 41:49.202
Me, either.

41:53.815 --> 41:55.730
Good night, Mom.

41:56.557 --> 41:58.298
Good night, Alex.

42:03.695 --> 42:04.522
I love you.
