00:09.417 --> 00:11.667
Hey, you guys,
guess what I found in my room.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.333
That pillow
you used to call Rob Lowe?

00:13.417 --> 00:15.041
-No.
-Oh, remember when I washed

00:15.125 --> 00:17.250
the Rob Lowe pillow
in a new detergent,

00:17.333 --> 00:19.250
and you got a rash
all over your body?

00:19.333 --> 00:21.709
It was everywhere.

00:21.792 --> 00:23.792
Why was it everywhere, Heather?

00:23.875 --> 00:25.417
No. Mom, thank you.

00:25.500 --> 00:27.500
I found the map

00:27.583 --> 00:30.000
-for the time capsule that we buried.
-No way!

00:30.083 --> 00:31.750
Do you remember, we were gonna
dig it up in high school,

00:31.834 --> 00:33.208
and then, you know,
we stopped being nerds.

00:33.291 --> 00:34.583
(forced laugh)

00:34.667 --> 00:36.125
Yeah, I wouldn't remember,

00:36.208 --> 00:38.667
'cause you guys never
included me in anything.

00:38.750 --> 00:40.041
I'd always hear you
guys give each other

00:40.125 --> 00:41.083
the secret signal.

00:41.166 --> 00:42.125
(whispering):
"Greg's asleep.

00:42.208 --> 00:44.083
Greg is asleep."

00:44.166 --> 00:45.583
But I wasn't.

00:45.667 --> 00:46.709
-No, we knew that.
-Yeah.

00:46.792 --> 00:48.333
That's what made it so funny.

00:48.417 --> 00:51.208
Yeah, well, it left me
psychologically scarred.

00:51.291 --> 00:52.417
I mean, not as much as the time

00:52.500 --> 00:54.125
that Dad busted in on me
holding a shotgun

00:54.208 --> 00:55.667
while I was pooping, but still.

00:55.750 --> 00:57.166
Oh, I remember that.

00:57.250 --> 00:58.792
-Mm.
-Why don't you go dig it up?

00:58.875 --> 01:00.750
It would be so much fun.

01:00.834 --> 01:03.792
-I'm in if you are.
-I-I'm totally in.

01:03.875 --> 01:05.667
MATT:
Yeah! Wonder Twins activate!

01:05.750 --> 01:08.542
Hey, you guys aren't twins.
They're not twins.

01:08.625 --> 01:10.458
It's okay.
We'll make popsicles.

01:10.542 --> 01:11.750
Just like we did
all those Friday nights

01:11.834 --> 01:13.208
when you were in high school.

01:13.291 --> 01:16.709
(stammers) Mom,
I'm married now, okay?

01:16.792 --> 01:19.250
-Okay.
-I'll have to ask Jen.

01:20.917 --> 01:22.458
This is really nice.

01:22.542 --> 01:24.417
Yeah. This is much better
than making popsicles.

01:24.500 --> 01:25.792
(chuckles)

01:25.875 --> 01:27.083
MATT and HEATHER:
Greg's asleep!

01:27.166 --> 01:28.500
Greg's asleep!

01:28.583 --> 01:30.709
-What is that?
-Greg's asleep!

01:30.792 --> 01:33.375
That is the sound of my brother
and sister loving me!

01:33.458 --> 01:35.458
-(grunts) Greg!
-I'm coming!

01:35.542 --> 01:37.000
Greg's asleep!

01:37.083 --> 01:38.458
Greg is asleep!

01:38.542 --> 01:40.041
You can come, too,
if you want, honey!

01:42.959 --> 01:46.625
No, I'll just stay here
with our baby.

01:51.709 --> 01:52.750
Hey, guys.

01:52.834 --> 01:54.291
Listen, Sophia knows exactly

01:54.375 --> 01:56.417
what's in that basket,
so don't take anything, okay?

01:56.500 --> 01:58.333
Yeah, okay. Oh, hey,
listen, before we go,

01:58.417 --> 02:00.750
I-I just wanted to say that,
you know,

02:00.834 --> 02:04.542
I-I'm really touched
that you included me.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.667
I mean, all of my life,
all I wanted was...

02:06.750 --> 02:08.417
Told you we should've
left him at home.

02:08.500 --> 02:09.959
Yeah. O-Okay.

02:10.041 --> 02:12.291
I'm just trying to say
I love you guys, that's all.

02:12.375 --> 02:14.000
-MATT: Shut up, Greg!
-(bicycle bells ringing)

02:14.083 --> 02:16.250
Love you a lot.

02:16.333 --> 02:17.500
HEATHER:
Come on!

02:19.709 --> 02:21.208
-Come on!
-It's okay-- yeah, I'm coming!

02:21.291 --> 02:22.500
I'm coming!

02:24.041 --> 02:26.417
Wait up, guys!

02:26.500 --> 02:28.500
(Heather whoops)

02:34.208 --> 02:36.166
(whispers):
Okay.

02:36.250 --> 02:37.959
All right.

02:38.041 --> 02:39.333
Here, here.

02:39.417 --> 02:41.125
-Thanks.
-And a light.

02:41.834 --> 02:43.041
Here.

02:43.125 --> 02:45.250
All right, ten running mans

02:45.333 --> 02:47.208
-that way.
-Okay.

02:47.291 --> 02:48.250
-Okay.
-MATT: All right.

02:48.333 --> 02:51.083
One, two, three...

02:54.125 --> 02:56.750
Okay. This is the drain pipe.

02:56.834 --> 03:00.375
"Don't look into it, or you will
get flushed up into the toilet."

03:00.458 --> 03:01.792
-Whoa.
-Yeah.

03:03.125 --> 03:05.041
Don't look, don't look,
don't look. Good job.

03:10.250 --> 03:12.000
MATT:
This is so great.

03:12.083 --> 03:14.542
I haven't been to this park
for, like, 30 years.

03:14.625 --> 03:16.166
-HEATHER: Really?
-Oh, yeah.

03:16.250 --> 03:17.625
I mean, I was too cool
in high school,

03:17.709 --> 03:18.792
and now that I'm an adult,

03:18.875 --> 03:20.834
I just buy my drugs online
like everybody else.

03:20.917 --> 03:22.333
Well, when you and Colleen
have kids,

03:22.417 --> 03:24.500
you'll be here, like, every day.

03:24.583 --> 03:25.834
Why? Because this is
the place I'm gonna

03:25.917 --> 03:27.417
set them free
because I can't afford them?

03:27.500 --> 03:29.709
Hey. I thought you were excited
about starting a family.

03:29.792 --> 03:31.083
Oh, totally.

03:31.166 --> 03:32.417
The kind of excited
where you wake up

03:32.500 --> 03:34.083
in a puddle of sweat
every night.

03:34.166 --> 03:35.959
-Oh, you get the night sweats, too?
-Oh, yeah.

03:36.041 --> 03:37.542
Tim says it might be
meat related.

03:37.625 --> 03:38.917
You could be over-sausage-ing.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.709
Huh.

03:40.792 --> 03:42.875
I just, I don't know
about the whole baby thing,

03:42.959 --> 03:43.917
guys, seriously.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.875
What if I screw up?

03:46.959 --> 03:48.542
It's okay.

03:48.625 --> 03:50.959
I mean, that's really
what parenting is.

03:51.041 --> 03:53.709
It's just making one terrible
decision after the next.

03:53.792 --> 03:56.792
-(laughs)
-And then just trying to fix
it before Jen finds out.

03:56.875 --> 03:59.333
I don't know, man.
You said yourself,

03:59.417 --> 04:02.125
I scarred you. I mean, what if
that's all that I'm good at?

04:02.208 --> 04:03.917
Hey.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.250
Three-fingered tree.

04:07.333 --> 04:11.083

is Stumpy Joe.

04:11.166 --> 04:13.709
-MATT: Stumpy Joe.
-GREG: Stumpy Joe.

04:13.792 --> 04:16.166
-Stumpy... Let's go!
-Come on, man.

04:16.250 --> 04:18.208
Oh, look.

04:18.291 --> 04:19.709
-There's our X.
-(chuckles): Oh.

04:19.792 --> 04:20.834
HEATHER:
Wow!

04:20.917 --> 04:23.625
Look at that! Oh! Oh, it's wet.

04:23.709 --> 04:26.166
And it didn't rain. Yeah,
something probably peed here.

04:26.250 --> 04:28.709
Oh, man. You know, we could
be digging here all night,

04:28.792 --> 04:30.250
depending on how deep
you guys...

04:30.333 --> 04:32.041
-(clank)
-There's our time capsule.

04:32.125 --> 04:34.542
Oh. So, what did you bury it in?

04:34.625 --> 04:36.417
Like, a waterproof safe
or a hollowed-out missile?

04:36.500 --> 04:37.709
Okay.

04:39.333 --> 04:41.625
Oh, just generic can.
That's cool.

04:41.709 --> 04:42.750
Hey, can I open it?

04:42.834 --> 04:45.250
Yeah, no, you should
definitely open it.

04:45.333 --> 04:46.792
-Oh...
-Oh.

04:46.875 --> 04:48.583
Ugh.

Oh, God, are those bones?

04:50.000 --> 04:51.667
MATT:
Oh, you know what?

04:51.750 --> 04:53.625
I don't think that
this is the map

04:53.709 --> 04:55.291
to where we buried
the time capsule.

04:55.375 --> 04:56.625
I think this is the map

04:56.709 --> 04:59.917
to where we buried
your dead guinea pig.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.834
Super Greggy?

05:03.166 --> 05:06.291
But Mom said he ran away because
I refused to take a bath.

05:06.375 --> 05:08.458
Tell him, Matt, just tell him.

05:08.542 --> 05:09.875
Tell me what, Matthew?

05:09.959 --> 05:12.709
Dad sucked Super Greggy
up into the Shop-Vac.

05:12.792 --> 05:14.333
What?

05:14.417 --> 05:15.625
Why didn't you tell me?

05:15.709 --> 05:17.000
Well,
I was trying to protect you.

05:17.083 --> 05:19.125
Dad killed all kinds of
stuff you never knew about.

05:19.208 --> 05:21.417
Hey, look at that
protective instinct.

05:21.500 --> 05:23.291
You're already a mama bear.

05:23.375 --> 05:25.458
Yeah, but it was just so
embarrassing to watch Greg cry.

05:25.542 --> 05:27.375
Well, that is a very important
part of parenting.

05:27.458 --> 05:29.250
-Fear and shame.
-Yeah.

05:29.333 --> 05:31.041
You're gonna be great at this.

05:31.125 --> 05:33.458
Huh, you know,
maybe you're right.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.625
Think of all the scars
you saved me from getting.

05:35.709 --> 05:37.291
I mean, not physical scars,

05:37.375 --> 05:40.166
'cause you were always
very, very rough with me.

05:40.250 --> 05:41.542
-Yeah.
-But you know what?

05:41.625 --> 05:43.542
It turned out okay.

05:43.625 --> 05:45.542
I mean, we all did. Huh?

05:45.625 --> 05:47.333
Thanks, you guys.

05:47.417 --> 05:52.291
Well, at least, uh, Super Greggy
Two died of natural causes.

05:52.375 --> 05:54.667
-Natural causes?
-Yeah.

05:54.750 --> 05:56.125
Dad thought he was
a moldy orange

05:56.208 --> 05:57.500
and threw him against a tree.

05:59.083 --> 06:00.750
Wow.

06:00.834 --> 06:03.667
Gonna need to take some time.

06:05.667 --> 06:06.792
Put him back.

06:06.875 --> 06:07.875

Oh, my God,

you guys must be starving.

06:22.208 --> 06:24.750
I could not get
a Lyft to come get me.

06:24.834 --> 06:26.000
I mean, I got connected,
but then the driver cancelled.

06:26.083 --> 06:27.792
Why does that keep happening?

Well, what's your rating?

some huge fee or something.

quite a lot.

Anybody can check their rating.

about something else, shall we?

-How poor is he?
-Oh.

I'm a four, and I've never once

06:53.458 --> 06:55.750
guessed my driver's
ethnicity correctly.

06:55.834 --> 06:57.166
I-I just, I don't understand.
Why would anyone ever

06:57.250 --> 06:59.667
rate me this low?
Like, I'm a great passenger.

I'm tidy. I'm nice.

07:13.208 --> 07:14.542
I mean, I'm nicer
than the average person,

07:14.625 --> 07:17.041
mostly because the average
person is a living nightmare.

What was my point?

You got to butter up your driver
a little bit, Jen.

07:32.625 --> 07:34.500

You know you're done
with the sugar.

07:42.625 --> 07:45.000
I'm so sorry.
I knew she wasn't allowed.

07:45.083 --> 07:46.208
She's just so charming.

07:46.291 --> 07:47.333
Yeah.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.792

bonding day ahead. You excited?

08:00.542 --> 08:04.458
You know me. If there's candy,
I'm getting in the car.

08:04.542 --> 08:06.291
Okay, we're gonna
circle back to that,

08:06.375 --> 08:08.417

problematic, but for now,

There's this new ice cream place

09:23.959 --> 09:25.959
The soft serve
comes out of faucets,

09:26.041 --> 09:27.959

tiny toilets.

Real wacky stuff.

Yeah,
but we just got you ice cream.

09:31.250 --> 09:33.834
Look, Aunt Jen, we both know
what's going on here.

09:33.917 --> 09:35.208
What? What do you mean?

09:35.291 --> 09:36.583
(chuckles):
What's going on? What?

09:36.667 --> 09:38.750
You're using me
to raise your Lyft rating,

No problem here.

09:45.583 --> 09:48.041
What else you got
in that magic bag of yours?

09:48.125 --> 09:50.458
Uh... gummy fish?

09:50.542 --> 09:53.000
Why not?
I could use the protein.

09:53.083 --> 09:54.583
Damn.

09:56.083 --> 09:59.000
Well, looks like you two had
a big day, huh?

09:59.083 --> 10:01.083
Sophia,
he's talking to you.

10:02.500 --> 10:03.792
Sophia.

10:03.875 --> 10:06.417
Oh, no. Um...

10:06.500 --> 10:08.709
Yeah, we did, and, um...

10:08.792 --> 10:12.709
has anyone ever told you
you're weatherman handsome?

10:12.792 --> 10:14.208
My mother used to say that.

10:14.291 --> 10:15.667
-Oh.
-But she's dead.

10:15.750 --> 10:17.709
-Okay.
-So it's really nice

10:17.792 --> 10:19.166
to hear it from somebody else.

10:19.250 --> 10:20.583
Say, you know what's weird?

10:20.667 --> 10:22.291
She kind of looks like her.

10:22.375 --> 10:23.583
Hey, wait a minute.

10:23.667 --> 10:25.291
You don't think
she could actually be...?

10:25.375 --> 10:26.709
Oh, I think for sure.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.125
Yeah, totally, totally, totally.

10:28.208 --> 10:30.208
Yeah, Sophia's a very old soul.

10:30.291 --> 10:31.417
-Huh.
-See?

10:31.500 --> 10:33.333
She can't even stay up
past 4:00.

10:33.417 --> 10:34.834

10:41.333 --> 10:43.291
Really? Yay!

10:44.375 --> 10:46.083
Move it, Sophia.
Come on, I got a great rating.

10:46.166 --> 10:47.875
We got to get out of here
before he realizes

10:47.959 --> 10:49.375
you're not the ghost
of his dead mom.

10:49.458 --> 10:52.375
I think I ate some bad fish.

10:52.458 --> 10:54.458
(vomiting, coughing)

10:54.542 --> 10:55.750
Are you serious?!

10:55.834 --> 10:58.291
Oh. Ugh. Oh, my God.

10:58.375 --> 10:59.917
Um, yeah, but you know what?

11:00.000 --> 11:02.125
Your mom is really trying
to tell you something.

11:02.208 --> 11:03.667
MAN:
<i>Support. How can I help you?</i>

11:03.750 --> 11:06.834
I'd like to report a passenger
for suspension.

11:06.917 --> 11:08.750
No. What?! Oh, come on, dude.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.542
I was doing so well.

11:10.625 --> 11:11.917
Well, I'd like to report

11:12.000 --> 11:14.417
that your car smells better
with vomit in it.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.250
And your mom thinks so, too.

11:16.333 --> 11:17.375
-Tell him, Mom.
-(vomiting)

11:17.458 --> 11:18.917
She's busy.

11:26.583 --> 11:28.500
Are those Meyer Lemons?

11:28.583 --> 11:30.166
Uh, yeah.

11:30.250 --> 11:31.792
(inhales deeply)

11:31.875 --> 11:33.917
Oh, that's such a sexy smell.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.041
(laughs) If I knew
you loved them that much, Mom,

11:36.125 --> 11:38.458
I would've taken more
from Pam and Darryl's tree.

11:39.625 --> 11:42.083
-What?
-Put these back on the tree.

11:42.166 --> 11:44.291
-They're blood lemons.
-Oh, Mom, come on.

11:44.375 --> 11:46.041
She gave them to me.

11:46.125 --> 11:47.458
No, it's all part of her game.

11:47.542 --> 11:49.709
She wants to put
her extra trash in our bins.

11:49.792 --> 11:50.750
And if I take

11:50.834 --> 11:53.959
-just one lemon...
-Mm-hmm.

11:54.041 --> 11:56.542
...then she gains
the leverage to do that.

11:56.625 --> 12:00.333
Okay, Mom, there are actual wars
going on in the world, okay?

12:00.417 --> 12:03.291
Oh, my God, do we not have
any Chardonnay left?

12:04.542 --> 12:06.125
(sniffing)

12:09.917 --> 12:11.583
(laughs):
Hey, Mom, listen.

12:11.667 --> 12:14.083
Pam just invited us over
for ladies' poker night.

12:14.166 --> 12:15.959
It's mostly just an excuse
to eat cheese

12:16.041 --> 12:17.959
and then talk about how
we <i>shouldn't </i>be eating cheese.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.792
Isn't that fantastic?

12:19.875 --> 12:21.709
You always regret eating cheese.

12:21.792 --> 12:23.583
Oh, I would just
slow you down, though.

12:23.667 --> 12:25.500
I've never played poker before.

12:25.583 --> 12:28.208
Even better.
See you tomorrow!

12:28.291 --> 12:29.250
(Pam laughs)

12:29.333 --> 12:30.542
Bring some extra cash,

12:30.625 --> 12:32.125
you know,
to make it interesting.

12:32.208 --> 12:34.125
I also charge for soda.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.667
Is that my lemon?

12:39.333 --> 12:40.375
(chuckles)

12:40.458 --> 12:42.208
(sniffs) Mmm, that's ripe.

12:42.291 --> 12:44.583
-(both laugh)
-Ciao, bella.

12:44.667 --> 12:46.750
<i>Now </i>do you believe
it's not a game?

12:46.834 --> 12:49.500
It's just a silly poker night
with a bunch of girls.

12:49.583 --> 12:51.041
What do you have to lose?

12:52.333 --> 12:54.375
$300 is the buy-in.

12:54.458 --> 12:58.250
What?! That's my entire
monthly hair removal budget.

12:58.333 --> 13:00.041
Mom, maybe we should
sit this one out.

13:00.125 --> 13:02.166
No, I just got all this

13:02.250 --> 13:04.041
from the change
we've been saving up.

13:04.125 --> 13:05.500
But you know what?

13:05.583 --> 13:08.834
The fun we had at
the Coinstar machine was enough.

13:08.917 --> 13:10.250
Yo, wash your hands.

13:10.333 --> 13:11.959
I got hepatitis from that once.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.709
All right, everybody's in.

13:13.792 --> 13:16.500
Consider it payment
for my first poker lesson.

13:16.583 --> 13:17.583
(women groaning)

13:17.667 --> 13:18.917
Ginger ale, anyone?

13:19.000 --> 13:20.667
-Ooh!
-$2.50.

13:23.166 --> 13:24.709
I have two of the people.

13:24.792 --> 13:26.333
Is that anything?

13:26.417 --> 13:28.625
Ah, they're not the same
people, so you have nothing.

13:28.709 --> 13:31.375
Really?
But they're so dressed up.

13:31.458 --> 13:33.875
It's your turn to be
the big blind, Joan.

13:33.959 --> 13:35.959
But I don't understand
the rules yet.

13:36.041 --> 13:37.750
I don't understand
how medicine works,

13:37.834 --> 13:40.000
but I still have to
dispense it at the pharmacy.

13:40.083 --> 13:41.125
Mm-hmm.

13:47.750 --> 13:50.375
I see you...

13:50.458 --> 13:52.250
I see you, too, Pam.
You look great.

13:52.333 --> 13:53.875
Oh, no, Mom.

13:53.959 --> 13:55.583
"I see you"--
that's-that's poker talk.

13:55.667 --> 13:57.542
PAM:
I see you,

13:57.625 --> 14:00.041
and I raise you $50.

14:01.083 --> 14:02.667
Unless you want to fold.

14:02.750 --> 14:04.917
No, I don't want to fold.
I want to unfold.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.083
-You want to call.
-I want to call.

14:07.166 --> 14:08.125
Actually, you can't
'cause you don't have

14:08.208 --> 14:09.166
enough to cover, so...

14:09.250 --> 14:10.875
How about, instead of money,

14:10.959 --> 14:12.375
you offer something else?

14:12.458 --> 14:13.917
I don't know, maybe, um...

14:14.000 --> 14:17.834
I put my spillover
garbage in your cans?

14:17.917 --> 14:19.041
(gasps)

14:19.125 --> 14:20.250
(whispering):
You were right.

14:20.333 --> 14:21.834
This is a game.

14:23.208 --> 14:24.417
And if I win,

14:24.500 --> 14:26.583
I get to pick lemons
off your tree,

14:26.667 --> 14:28.417
when seasonally appropriate.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.250
Deal.

14:30.333 --> 14:32.709
Because I've got

14:32.792 --> 14:34.458
three... little...

14:34.542 --> 14:37.083
piggies, and they're crying

14:37.166 --> 14:41.166
"wee-wee-wee" all the way home
to your recycle bin.

14:41.250 --> 14:43.875
That's an interesting story.

14:45.125 --> 14:48.667
Once upon a time,
there was a rabbit and a fox,

14:48.750 --> 14:50.125
both very cunning animals.

14:50.208 --> 14:52.083
The fox, especially.

14:52.166 --> 14:56.417
She lets the rabbit think
she's harmless, you know.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.166
Perhaps they're even friends.

14:58.250 --> 15:00.166
And then, one day,

15:00.250 --> 15:04.208
without warning, she strikes.

15:12.500 --> 15:14.083
And...

15:14.166 --> 15:17.166
that... is...

15:17.250 --> 15:20.625
how... you...

15:20.709 --> 15:22.667
lose.

15:24.125 --> 15:26.709
Oh, thank God, Mom.
For a minute there,

15:26.792 --> 15:28.625
I thought you were just
really, really stupid.

15:28.709 --> 15:30.125
Yo, that fox/rabbit thing
she said,

15:30.208 --> 15:31.375
is that a well-known parable?

15:31.458 --> 15:32.875
It is now.

15:32.959 --> 15:36.208
I'm so glad that I met all
of you, and perhaps someday

15:36.291 --> 15:39.250
you'll tell me the story
of how you all became friends.

15:39.333 --> 15:41.041
PAM:
Well played, Joan.

15:41.125 --> 15:44.291
Maybe you and I need to take
a ride out to Vegas together.

15:44.375 --> 15:46.000
Oh, I'd love that, but...

15:46.083 --> 15:49.041
I've been banned
from all the good casinos.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.583
JOAN:
<i>John?</i>

15:56.667 --> 15:59.542
John? The...

15:59.625 --> 16:01.250
-John!
-Hmm?

16:01.333 --> 16:04.083
The dishwasher repairman
<i>did </i>come by yesterday.

16:04.166 --> 16:05.375
He stood at the door

16:05.458 --> 16:08.333
for 15 minutes trying
to get your attention.

16:09.375 --> 16:10.750
I'm not gonna suffer though

16:10.834 --> 16:14.625
a "La Cucaracha" doorbell
when you can't even hear it.

16:14.709 --> 16:16.083
That's impossible.

16:16.166 --> 16:17.667
You didn't hear the bell.

16:17.750 --> 16:19.792
No, you go to hell, Joanie.

16:21.250 --> 16:24.041
TIM:
All right. Let's get these on you there.

16:24.125 --> 16:26.959
Now, don't worry, John, I do
this test at work all the time.

16:27.041 --> 16:28.166
You hear a noise,
you raise your hand.

16:28.250 --> 16:29.500
While your hand is up, I'll say,

16:29.583 --> 16:30.792
"Who thinks I'm handsome?"

16:30.875 --> 16:33.291
We both laugh.
Five stars on Yelp.

16:33.375 --> 16:35.750
You bring it.
I'll beat you at any test.

16:35.834 --> 16:37.709
(laughs):
No, no. This isn't you against me.

16:37.792 --> 16:39.667
I'm already in your head.

16:39.750 --> 16:42.792
Okay, let's, uh, let's begin.
Shall we?

16:42.875 --> 16:44.291
(tone plays)

16:44.375 --> 16:45.417
(barks)

16:47.917 --> 16:49.083
See? I still got it.
(chuckles)

16:49.166 --> 16:50.959
Yeah.

16:52.333 --> 16:54.333
-JOAN: Coming!
-(barking)

16:54.417 --> 16:56.458
Oh, go ahead, run out on me.

16:56.542 --> 16:58.625
You're only cheating yourself,
John.

17:00.750 --> 17:02.041
Look, there's nothing
to be upset about.

17:02.125 --> 17:03.500
It's very natural
for a man your age

17:03.583 --> 17:04.959
to start losing his hearing,
but look,

17:05.041 --> 17:06.625
you still got your figure.

17:06.709 --> 17:08.917
God, I'd kill
for a bod like that.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.250
I am not getting hearing aids.

17:12.125 --> 17:13.166
JOHN:
<i>Hey!</i>

17:13.250 --> 17:14.792
Huh?

17:14.875 --> 17:16.166
You like 'em?

17:16.250 --> 17:18.208
I call 'em "A Beat Off by John."

17:18.291 --> 17:20.542
Suddenly I feel less embarrassed

17:20.625 --> 17:22.041
my dad's still rocking
a French braid.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.458
-Oh, what was that, honey?
-Hmm?

17:23.542 --> 17:25.583
You got to speak
right into the mic.

17:25.667 --> 17:26.875
It's like I'm delivering
a special message

17:26.959 --> 17:27.917
at a bar mitzvah.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.250
Um... wow.

17:29.333 --> 17:31.583
Mazel, Joshy.
You're a man now.

17:31.667 --> 17:33.083
Okay. Uh, hey, Mom,

17:33.166 --> 17:36.458
would you, uh,
would you pass the...

17:36.542 --> 17:37.625
-asparagus.
-Yeah.

17:37.709 --> 17:39.291
Sure.

17:39.375 --> 17:40.333
So, honey,

17:40.417 --> 17:41.667
how's the construction going?

17:41.750 --> 17:43.166
Oh, gosh, you know what?
It was a crazy week,

17:43.250 --> 17:44.667
but I feel like
it's finally starting...

17:44.750 --> 17:45.750
What am I doing with this?

17:45.834 --> 17:47.750
Give it to your sister.
She's talking.

17:47.834 --> 17:50.834
And then we'll start doing the
drywall next week, which is...

17:50.917 --> 17:51.917
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-No, Greg.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.625
-The bagels! The bagels!
-Oh, dude, no!

17:53.709 --> 17:55.667
Hey, this is for our father.

17:55.750 --> 17:58.250
Yeah. (chuckles)

17:59.917 --> 18:01.792
So, um...

18:01.875 --> 18:03.709
the insurance company
finally got a check to us,

18:03.792 --> 18:06.375
so now we can actually
pay the contractors.

18:06.458 --> 18:08.458
That money was from
the insurance company?

18:08.542 --> 18:10.583
Oh, God, no, what did
you spend it on, Tim?

18:10.667 --> 18:11.959
I bought
a leather beanbag chair.

18:12.041 --> 18:14.041
-Oh, what?
-And a leather hat.

18:14.125 --> 18:15.375
-HEATHER: Oh!
-But they gave me a free vest.

18:15.458 --> 18:16.417
Well, okay.

18:16.500 --> 18:17.709
Hey, keep up, Greg.

18:17.792 --> 18:19.083
I'm not hearing everything.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.458
Tim got a stupid hat.

18:20.542 --> 18:22.500
Hey, Dad, you want to--

18:22.583 --> 18:23.709
Just a suggestion.

18:23.792 --> 18:25.458
Maybe go wireless.

18:25.542 --> 18:26.792
Wireless?

18:26.875 --> 18:30.166
And have every FBI van
at the curb hearing us?

18:30.250 --> 18:31.875
No, thank you.

18:31.959 --> 18:34.083
Hey, check out the range
on this baby.

18:34.166 --> 18:35.583
Hey, Mom-Mom,
are these brownies kid-safe...

18:35.667 --> 18:36.667
Whoa, look out!

18:36.750 --> 18:38.250
-Oh!
-JOAN: Oh!

18:38.333 --> 18:39.709
This is more embarrassing

18:39.792 --> 18:41.417
than when Dad wears
his jeans in the pool.

18:41.500 --> 18:42.667
Mom, Sophia is trying to get out

18:42.750 --> 18:44.041
of Grandparents' Day at school,

18:44.125 --> 18:47.917
unless she can convince Tim
to wear his old man makeup.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.375
Sometimes, he tries to get into
movies for three bucks less.

18:50.458 --> 18:51.625
Does that really work?

18:51.709 --> 18:53.875
Because last Halloween,
I went as Orville Redenbacher.

18:53.959 --> 18:55.375
I thought you were Mark Twain.

18:55.458 --> 18:56.792
Why would I go as Mark Twain?

18:56.875 --> 18:58.125
JOAN:
Kids,

18:58.208 --> 18:59.583
I've tried to talk
to your father,

18:59.667 --> 19:01.709
but he can be
surprisingly sensitive

19:01.792 --> 19:04.792
for someone who still wears
an "I love to fart" T-shirt.

19:04.875 --> 19:07.250
Mom, he just looks so stupid.

19:07.333 --> 19:09.000
Nah, nah, nah, nah...
(stammers)

19:10.000 --> 19:11.500
HEATHER:
Oh, Dad, I'm sorry.

19:11.583 --> 19:12.917
God, I-I just, I meant...

19:13.000 --> 19:14.875
I think I'm picking up
a police scanner.

19:14.959 --> 19:18.709
Yeah, apparently, there's
a murder-suicide down the block.

19:18.792 --> 19:20.458
-Oh, thank goodness.
-Oh, thank you.

19:20.542 --> 19:21.875
JOAN:
<i>Honey,</i>

19:21.959 --> 19:24.417
please try hearing aids.

19:24.500 --> 19:26.959
I don't want to look old.

19:28.083 --> 19:30.208
You start replacing parts on me,

19:30.291 --> 19:33.375
and eventually you're gonna
replace all of me.

19:33.458 --> 19:34.542
I'll be gone.

19:34.625 --> 19:37.291
I'm not letting you go anywhere.

19:37.375 --> 19:38.333
Well...

19:38.417 --> 19:40.792
And you won't be old in these.

19:40.875 --> 19:42.834
They're almost invisible.

19:42.917 --> 19:44.750
They hook up to your phone,

19:44.834 --> 19:46.875
and so you can control
the volume.

19:46.959 --> 19:48.667
Well...

19:48.750 --> 19:50.291
they are awfully dope.

19:52.542 --> 19:53.917
JOHN:
<i>Hey.</i>

19:54.000 --> 19:55.583
Great news, guys.

19:55.667 --> 19:57.583
Mom-Mom gave me aids.

19:58.709 --> 19:59.667
(whispers):
Hearing aids.

19:59.750 --> 20:00.709
Oh.

20:00.792 --> 20:01.750
Here. Have some coffee.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.750
-Hmm?
-(pours loudly)

20:04.959 --> 20:06.667
(chewing loudly)

20:08.667 --> 20:09.625
(tapping keys loudly)

20:09.709 --> 20:10.875
(phone whooshes loudly)

20:10.959 --> 20:12.208
(amplified):
So, my friend Susan

20:12.291 --> 20:14.125
was attacked by birds.

20:14.208 --> 20:16.000
How are they working, dear?

20:16.083 --> 20:17.625
Do you want to turn up
the volume?

20:17.709 --> 20:19.875
Oh, I forgot you could do that.

20:19.959 --> 20:21.083
So, Tim, uh,

20:21.166 --> 20:22.959
how's everything been with you?

20:23.041 --> 20:24.375
I really want to hear.

20:24.458 --> 20:25.875
Oh, you stepped in it now, John.

20:25.959 --> 20:27.458
Well, I, um, actually,
I joined a leather club,

20:27.542 --> 20:28.875
(volume decreasing):
but that was-- actually,

20:28.959 --> 20:30.208
I-I should start
at the beginning.

20:30.291 --> 20:31.667
