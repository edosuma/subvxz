WEBVTT

01:09.475 --> 01:12.311
- The rules of the
game are these.

01:13.215 --> 01:16.876
One, go into a quiet room.

01:16.911 --> 01:20.550
Two, place a candle
in the middle.

01:22.455 --> 01:23.355
Light it.

01:24.325 --> 01:26.160
Use a book with a red cover

01:26.195 --> 01:27.887
and without illustrations.

01:29.462 --> 01:33.299
Three, ask for permission
to enter the game

01:33.334 --> 01:35.499
and never quit the game

01:35.534 --> 01:37.501
without requesting
it from the book.

01:39.670 --> 01:41.703
We're gonna need a
book with a red cover.

01:43.245 --> 01:44.409
- I have one in my room.

01:45.378 --> 01:47.742
- Are you sure your
parents aren't coming?

01:47.777 --> 01:49.183
- Yeah, I'm sure.

01:49.218 --> 01:50.481
My Daddy's working all night

01:50.516 --> 01:52.219
and my brother won't wake up

01:52.254 --> 01:53.913
even if there's
fireworks over his head.

01:55.917 --> 01:56.817
- And your mom?

01:57.786 --> 02:02.229
- It's just my dad, my
younger brother and me.

02:02.264 --> 02:03.659
My mom passed away.

02:04.728 --> 02:07.663
- Oh, I'm sorry. What happened?

02:09.568 --> 02:13.207
- A few months ago she had an
accident on her way to work.

02:13.242 --> 02:14.274
She was a doctor.

02:21.250 --> 02:22.183
- I'm sorry.

02:23.648 --> 02:25.351
- Well, let's continue.

02:25.386 --> 02:26.451
Bring the book.

02:31.425 --> 02:33.821
Let's freak her out.

02:33.856 --> 02:35.559
- You're so evil.

02:35.594 --> 02:37.264
Oh, I love you baby.

02:37.299 --> 02:38.331
- Thank you.

03:05.393 --> 03:05.985
- Bea!

03:10.860 --> 03:12.299
I had a nightmare.

03:12.334 --> 03:14.367
There was a horrible woman.

03:24.709 --> 03:26.478
- She is such a free.

03:30.715 --> 03:33.353
Now that is one creepy ass book.

03:33.388 --> 03:35.784
- It was already here
when we moved in.

03:40.857 --> 03:42.560
- It's perfect.

03:49.063 --> 03:50.337
Is that your cat?

03:51.173 --> 03:54.341
- No, it was already
in the house too.

03:54.376 --> 03:57.839
It must have belong to the woman
who was living here before.

03:57.874 --> 04:00.545
- Mmmh, it must be
the witch's cat.

04:00.580 --> 04:01.414
- Yeah.

04:03.352 --> 04:04.582
- What witch?

04:04.617 --> 04:06.914
- Don't you know the
story of this house?

04:06.949 --> 04:09.818
About the creepy old lady
who used to live here.

04:09.853 --> 04:12.821
The whole town says
she was a witch.

04:12.856 --> 04:14.757
She did satanic
rituals on animals

04:14.792 --> 04:17.958
and then one day
she disappeared.

04:17.993 --> 04:19.729
And that's her cat.

04:19.764 --> 04:24.404
- People say that cat
it's actually a demon

04:25.506 --> 04:28.474
that possesses its owners.

05:10.584 --> 05:11.352
- Bonnie!

05:44.618 --> 05:45.452
Bonnie!

05:47.819 --> 05:48.653
Bonnie!

05:56.762 --> 06:00.533
Bonnie, Bonnie, hey, hey.

06:02.064 --> 06:03.470
What happened?

06:03.505 --> 06:04.900
Are you okay?

06:25.659 --> 06:26.625
Hey.

06:28.189 --> 06:29.056
I'm home.

06:40.707 --> 06:41.706
Where did you come from?

07:09.868 --> 07:12.803
Bonnie, what happened here?

07:14.741 --> 07:15.575
Bonnie?

07:19.977 --> 07:20.811
Bonnie.

07:23.750 --> 07:25.684
Let's cover, cover you up.

07:31.692 --> 07:32.889
Bonnie, what are you doing?

07:35.597 --> 07:36.222
Bonnie!

07:42.197 --> 07:44.065
You can't be out here
like this, Bonnie.

08:13.998 --> 08:15.294
Argus?

08:21.005 --> 08:26.008
I missed you, Argus.

08:29.310 --> 08:30.980
Come on.

08:54.841 --> 08:55.873
Argus, come on.

08:58.812 --> 08:59.943
Come on, let's go.

09:23.133 --> 09:24.066
Don't judge me.

09:30.712 --> 09:32.679
You'll enjoy this.

09:32.714 --> 09:34.945
Picked it up on
the way to Libya.

09:34.980 --> 09:38.652
I thought Bonnie
would love this.

09:44.088 --> 09:46.990
That was a year ago.

09:55.231 --> 09:56.670
Alright, buddy.

09:57.772 --> 09:59.068
You've had enough.

10:31.971 --> 10:33.069
Argus, no, no.

14:27.503 --> 14:29.206
I'm sorry. It was Argus.

14:29.241 --> 14:30.911
It happened so fast.

14:36.380 --> 14:37.676
Bonnie no.

18:42.593 --> 18:43.889
- You're making fun of me.

18:45.497 --> 18:46.397
- Yeah, I'm sorry Bea

18:46.432 --> 18:48.267
but you see in your face though.

18:48.302 --> 18:50.665
You were freaking
out, it was amazing.

18:50.700 --> 18:51.963
- I don't know if it's true,

18:51.998 --> 18:53.701
a friend told me that story.

18:53.736 --> 18:55.307
But the disappearance
of the old woman

18:55.342 --> 18:57.507
who used to live
here, that's true.

18:58.477 --> 19:02.182
Anyway, let's get back to rules.

19:03.515 --> 19:07.583
Four, close your eyes,

19:07.618 --> 19:11.290
place the palm of your
hand on the books cover

19:11.325 --> 19:13.391
and ask the following question.

19:15.021 --> 19:18.858
Red book, may I enter your game?

19:27.869 --> 19:30.804
"The sky suddenly turned dark."

19:32.412 --> 19:33.543
That's not a yes!

19:33.578 --> 19:35.380
It makes no sense.

19:35.415 --> 19:37.316
- But it's pretty is scary.

19:37.351 --> 19:39.945
- Oh, come on Sophie,
this game is a scam.

19:39.980 --> 19:41.914
- Are you frightened, babe?

19:41.949 --> 19:42.915
- Are you frightened babe?

19:42.950 --> 19:44.488
- He's right, we
better leave it.

19:45.623 --> 19:46.820
- Let's try again.

19:52.960 --> 19:56.335
- Red book, may
I enter your game?

20:01.837 --> 20:03.474
- "She opened door,

20:03.509 --> 20:06.378
and let in the
shadows of the past."

20:08.448 --> 20:09.513
- Is that a yes?

20:14.454 --> 20:15.321
- Did you hear that?

20:17.358 --> 20:18.324
- Ahh, no.

20:20.086 --> 20:21.525
- I don't wanna play this.

20:21.560 --> 20:22.625
Let's watch a movie.

20:27.335 --> 20:29.335
- Is there anyone with us?

20:34.507 --> 20:36.001
"She was not alone.

20:36.036 --> 20:39.477
The shadows of the past
were always with her."

20:39.512 --> 20:41.446
This is awesome!

20:41.481 --> 20:42.777
- Okay, let me try.

20:42.812 --> 20:45.483
It's getting pretty good.

20:45.518 --> 20:46.352
Okay.

20:50.490 --> 20:52.391
How old am I?

20:59.697 --> 21:03.534
"They met October the 17th
at the Counts mansion."

21:07.738 --> 21:09.903
That makes no sense.

21:09.938 --> 21:12.378
- Wait, the people
who play this game

21:12.413 --> 21:14.941
argue that the answers
aren't always literal.

21:14.976 --> 21:18.010
Listen, October is month 10.

21:19.783 --> 21:21.013
- So?

21:21.048 --> 21:23.356
- And it says the 17th.

21:23.391 --> 21:25.017
10 plus 17 is 27.

21:29.155 --> 21:30.594
- Holy shit, it guessed it.

21:32.829 --> 21:33.729
It did.

21:33.764 --> 21:35.401
- You're fucking with me again.

21:35.436 --> 21:37.502
- I swear to you Bea,
this is not a joke.

21:37.537 --> 21:38.470
Your turn.

21:52.849 --> 21:56.081
If you don't believe
us, ask for proof.

22:01.726 --> 22:05.024
- If you're really
here with us, prove it.

22:06.632 --> 22:09.127
- But that's not a question
though, will it work?

22:09.162 --> 22:12.504
- "She screams loudly,
but no one can hear her."

22:13.639 --> 22:15.672
- What does it mean by that?

22:20.844 --> 22:23.713
- That scream came
from inside the house.

22:23.748 --> 22:25.682
- No, it truly came
from the street.

22:26.850 --> 22:28.553
- It just wants
to scare us guys.

22:30.557 --> 22:32.623
- Do you realize that
she's in the house with us?

22:32.658 --> 22:33.954
I don't wanna play anymore.

22:33.989 --> 22:35.153
- We can't quit the game

22:35.188 --> 22:37.397
without asking
permission from the book.

22:39.665 --> 22:41.797
- Maybe we should ask
permission from the book.

22:50.940 --> 22:54.678
- Red book, how can
we leave the game?

23:06.725 --> 23:07.856
- Sophie, that's not funny.

23:09.827 --> 23:11.992
Sophie stop joking,
that's enough.

23:12.027 --> 23:13.026
Sophie stop that.

23:13.930 --> 23:14.764
Sophie...

23:20.739 --> 23:22.640
- What the fuck was that?

23:24.743 --> 23:26.039
- Okay, we gotta go.

23:26.074 --> 23:28.239
We gotta get the fuck outta
here right now, right now.

23:28.274 --> 23:30.714
- It's helping us,
didn't you see?

23:30.749 --> 23:31.682
- What?

23:31.717 --> 23:32.947
No I'm done with this shit.

23:32.982 --> 23:34.718
I just wanna get outta here.

23:34.753 --> 23:36.918
- If we leave the game,
we'll be in real danger.

23:36.953 --> 23:38.084
That's what it said.

23:42.992 --> 23:44.959
How many spirits are with us?

23:52.771 --> 23:53.605
Three.

24:02.242 --> 24:06.112
- Red book, how can we
get out of the game?

24:13.759 --> 24:17.123
"Read me."

24:18.830 --> 24:19.928
- What? What does it mean?

24:35.011 --> 24:36.274
- It's a story.

24:40.687 --> 24:41.785
- I'll start.

24:56.901 --> 24:59.935
"She was sitting in the car

24:59.970 --> 25:01.937
feeling pain and sadness."

25:17.856 --> 25:18.657
- Sorry.

25:39.746 --> 25:41.273
And this two, please.

26:30.962 --> 26:31.796
- Here.

26:37.034 --> 26:38.000
Does it hurt?

26:47.242 --> 26:48.879
Got you water too.

26:48.914 --> 26:49.814
If you wanna take
whatever they gave you-

26:49.849 --> 26:51.013
- Can you just take me home?

26:53.347 --> 26:54.247
- Yeah, of course.

27:35.290 --> 27:37.730
Hey, we'll try again, okay.

27:44.266 --> 27:46.398
Over there is nothing
that you could have done.

27:51.207 --> 27:53.141
Hey, come on, talk to me.

27:56.377 --> 27:58.311
- Do you think
that this is easy?

27:59.215 --> 28:00.412
- No, of course.

28:00.447 --> 28:01.787
- It was a part
of you too, Nick.

28:03.318 --> 28:04.383
- I know.
- Yeah.

28:05.892 --> 28:08.090
Well, it doesn't seem that way.

28:08.125 --> 28:09.157
Not this time,

28:10.325 --> 28:11.324
not last time.

28:17.904 --> 28:22.335
- What do you want me to say?

28:22.370 --> 28:25.272
- I don't want you
to say anything.

28:34.217 --> 28:37.790
- Ever think that maybe-

28:37.825 --> 28:38.417
- What?

28:39.552 --> 28:40.452
- Nothing.

28:40.487 --> 28:41.387
- No, what were you gonna say?

28:41.422 --> 28:42.553
- Nothing, I wasn't gonna say,

28:42.588 --> 28:45.292
I don't know, Chloe!

28:45.327 --> 28:49.329
Maybe this is God trying
to tell us something.

28:49.364 --> 28:50.528
- God's trying tell
us something?...

28:50.563 --> 28:52.332
- Yes, I don't know,
I don't know...

28:52.367 --> 28:55.335
Maybe this isn't the
right time for us.

28:55.370 --> 28:57.238
That we should wait
to do this later on.

29:08.053 --> 29:08.887
Fuck.

29:13.355 --> 29:14.189
I'm sorry.

29:15.962 --> 29:17.390
Chloe, I'm sorry.
- Pull the car over...

29:17.425 --> 29:18.589
Just pull the fucking
car over Nick...

29:18.624 --> 29:20.030
- We're in the
middle of no where

29:20.065 --> 29:20.833
I'm not going to pull
the car over right here.

29:20.868 --> 29:21.427
Well look where we are

29:21.462 --> 29:22.362
- Nick stop the car

29:22.397 --> 29:23.594
we are in the middle of no where

29:23.629 --> 29:25.233
I'm not going to
pull the car over-

29:25.268 --> 29:26.168
- Nick, stop the car.
- Wait stop the fucking car

29:26.203 --> 29:26.971
- What the fuck are you doing?

29:32.407 --> 29:34.407
Are you trying to kill us?

29:34.442 --> 29:35.474
- I think I saw something.

29:38.017 --> 29:38.851
- Hey, you okay?

29:40.415 --> 29:41.546
- Let me see your head.

29:43.352 --> 29:44.923
Chloe, where are you going?

29:46.520 --> 29:47.354
Chloe.

29:53.494 --> 29:54.328
Chloe.

29:57.102 --> 29:57.936
- Hey.

30:11.446 --> 30:15.052
It's okay.

30:15.087 --> 30:15.921
- Chloe.

30:19.322 --> 30:21.454
- Don't take another damn step.

30:25.658 --> 30:27.361
Leave.

30:27.396 --> 30:30.397
Just get back in your car
and continue on your way.

30:32.500 --> 30:34.038
Chloe, let's go.

30:35.668 --> 30:37.668
- Did you hurt him?

30:37.703 --> 30:38.603
Did he hurt you?

30:38.638 --> 30:41.177
- Don't you dare touch that boy.

30:41.212 --> 30:44.576
You do not understand what
that demon is capable of.

30:44.611 --> 30:45.412
- You're lying.

30:45.447 --> 30:46.545
- Chloe.

30:46.580 --> 30:48.448
This is non of our business.

30:48.483 --> 30:49.449
Let's go, come on.

30:51.519 --> 30:53.123
Chloe.

30:53.158 --> 30:55.290
Just listen to the man, please.

30:55.325 --> 30:56.126
Come on.

31:01.166 --> 31:02.363
- Okay.

31:02.398 --> 31:03.199
Okay.

31:29.029 --> 31:30.028
- Hey. Hey.

31:30.063 --> 31:30.655
You okay?

31:30.690 --> 31:32.327
- Yeah, I'm okay.

31:38.203 --> 31:39.037
Come on.

31:42.009 --> 31:43.107
We're done.

31:43.142 --> 31:43.976
Okay.

31:45.606 --> 31:47.177
Lets get you back in the car.

31:52.613 --> 31:55.317
- Wait, Nick we
can't just leave.

31:56.254 --> 31:57.055
- Okay.

32:25.382 --> 32:26.216
- Don't.

32:27.780 --> 32:28.614
Don't.

32:30.486 --> 32:31.320
Don't.

32:36.063 --> 32:37.623
You don't understand.

32:39.693 --> 32:40.659
You don't get it.

32:40.694 --> 32:42.562
You don't understand

32:44.500 --> 32:45.367
- Hey.

33:06.093 --> 33:07.257
Hey.

33:07.292 --> 33:08.093
It's okay.

33:09.822 --> 33:10.689
You're okay.

33:18.699 --> 33:19.698
You're okay.

33:19.733 --> 33:20.699
It's okay.

33:24.738 --> 33:26.243
You are safe now

33:57.144 --> 33:58.539
- Nothing happened.

34:14.755 --> 34:16.260
- What do you see?

34:19.463 --> 34:20.264
- Nothing.

34:20.299 --> 34:22.134
There's nothing there.

34:40.418 --> 34:45.289
- Nose, nose, nose, lips, he
repeats sitting on the bed.

34:48.888 --> 34:52.923
Nose, nose, nose, lips,

34:52.958 --> 34:54.892
nose, nose, nose, nose.

34:54.927 --> 34:56.828
Nose, nose, nose, nose.

35:02.902 --> 35:05.903
Nose, nose, nose,
nose, noses, nose.

35:09.909 --> 35:11.282
Eyes.

35:20.260 --> 35:20.885
- Mommy.

35:21.855 --> 35:23.228
- What's the matter Ji-hyo.

35:24.759 --> 35:25.560
- I had a bad dreams.

35:25.595 --> 35:26.495
- Another bad dream?

35:26.530 --> 35:28.266
- Daddy's eyes were strange.

35:28.301 --> 35:28.893
- Why, honey?

35:28.928 --> 35:29.894
Daddy's fine.

35:29.929 --> 35:30.928
- I wanna go to see him.

35:33.471 --> 35:35.339
- I don't want you
to go in there.

35:35.374 --> 35:36.274
Don't wake Daddy up.

35:48.717 --> 35:50.189
- It's your brother-in-law.

35:52.853 --> 35:54.193
- Hello, good morning.

35:57.264 --> 35:59.231
No, I'm outside right now.

36:02.401 --> 36:05.237
No, I'm working right now and
I think I'm gonna be late.

36:08.704 --> 36:09.538
Yeah.

36:11.410 --> 36:13.245
But they're both
probably sleeping now.

36:15.612 --> 36:18.547
Sorry, but I'm a
little bit busy now.

36:18.582 --> 36:19.383
Yes

36:19.418 --> 36:20.615
Talk to you later.

36:22.553 --> 36:26.687
- Mommy, why did you lie
to your brother-in-law?

36:26.722 --> 36:28.590
- You should call
him, uncle, Ji-hyo.

36:30.462 --> 36:32.726
- Why did you lie to my uncle?

36:34.664 --> 36:37.632
- We have to be careful of him.

36:39.339 --> 36:39.964
- Why?

36:44.806 --> 36:46.311
- Your dad is sick, right?

36:48.942 --> 36:51.283
- So we got some
insurance money.

36:51.318 --> 36:52.284
- Yes.

36:54.618 --> 36:58.818
I think your uncle's
thinking of that money.

37:02.054 --> 37:04.857
- Did we receive
insurance money as well

37:04.892 --> 37:06.331
When Daddy got burned?

37:09.699 --> 37:10.698
- You remember that?

37:13.098 --> 37:15.032
You're so smart Ji-hyo.

37:15.067 --> 37:16.506
- Yes, I remember everything.

37:24.978 --> 37:25.977
- Hyeon-woo.

37:27.750 --> 37:28.584
Ji-hyo.

37:36.528 --> 37:37.362
Ji-hyo.

37:42.567 --> 37:43.401
Hyen-woo

37:55.415 --> 37:56.040
Ji-hyo

38:01.388 --> 38:02.013
Ji-hyo

38:20.506 --> 38:22.539
- I said we had to be quiet.

38:22.574 --> 38:23.870
- Mommy, why did you cough?

38:23.905 --> 38:25.575
- When did I do that?

38:28.514 --> 38:30.613
Why don't you go to your room
and do what you have to do?

38:30.648 --> 38:32.417
- What about you, mommy?

38:32.452 --> 38:34.452
- Mommy's gonna
go to mommy's room

38:34.487 --> 38:35.816
and do with mommy do with dad.

38:35.851 --> 38:37.048
- Oh, please, me too.

38:37.083 --> 38:38.918
I wanna do it too.

38:38.953 --> 38:40.018
- No way.

38:40.053 --> 38:40.887
- Yes.

38:42.121 --> 38:42.955
- Why.

38:42.990 --> 38:43.791
- Yeah.

38:47.434 --> 38:49.401
- You little bitch.

38:51.999 --> 38:54.505
The minute I'm nice to
you, you walk all over me.

40:33.903 --> 40:34.737
- Ji-hyo.

40:37.203 --> 40:38.939
Did you eat anything.

40:42.912 --> 40:44.747
I need you to call uncle.

40:45.683 --> 40:49.719
Tell him to come when
mommy is not here.

41:09.070 --> 41:09.970
- Sleeping?

41:15.747 --> 41:17.208
You're not sleeping.

41:41.872 --> 41:42.904
It's all right.

41:42.939 --> 41:44.807
Just hold still for a minute.

41:44.842 --> 41:45.775
Stay still.

41:48.010 --> 41:48.811
It's okay.

43:55.467 --> 43:56.301
- Shhhhh.

44:30.073 --> 44:32.007
- Ji-hyo, what are
you doing there?

44:38.378 --> 44:40.147
Come out from there.

44:54.295 --> 44:59.166
- I'm doing all this because
Daddy wants me to, huh?

45:00.939 --> 45:02.774
Daddy can't make any money now.

45:02.809 --> 45:07.339
And he asked mommy to do this
so we can raise you Ji-hyo.

45:07.374 --> 45:08.340
- You're lying.

45:08.375 --> 45:10.078
Don't hurt Daddy.

45:10.113 --> 45:11.211
- Okay.

45:11.246 --> 45:13.180
Then will you take
his place instead?

45:17.186 --> 45:18.823
Will you take his place, huh?

45:20.057 --> 45:20.957
Ji-hyo, will you?

45:23.258 --> 45:24.323
Let's do it Ji-hyo.

45:24.358 --> 45:25.357
Come here.

45:25.392 --> 45:27.359
Come here, Ji-hyo.

45:27.394 --> 45:29.196
- Please Let me go.

45:30.397 --> 45:31.561
Mommy, mommy.

45:31.596 --> 45:32.903
Daddy, Daddy.

45:37.041 --> 45:38.040
I'm sorry.

45:38.075 --> 45:39.173
I'm sorry.

45:39.208 --> 45:40.042
I'm sorry.

45:42.277 --> 45:43.111
Let me go.

45:44.081 --> 45:45.278
- It's okay, come here.

45:45.313 --> 45:46.543
It'll be alright.

45:46.578 --> 45:48.281
Stay still.

45:48.316 --> 45:50.217
Stay still.

45:50.252 --> 45:51.086
Stay still

45:54.025 --> 45:55.255
- Do it to Daddy.

45:59.393 --> 46:00.865
- What?

46:00.900 --> 46:02.262
- Do it to Daddy.

46:06.433 --> 46:08.301
- Then why don't
you go out Ji-hyo?

46:10.910 --> 46:11.502
Huh?

46:11.537 --> 46:12.371
Go.

46:21.118 --> 46:23.217
Nose, nose, nose lips.

46:26.519 --> 46:28.321
Nose, nose, nose, nose.

46:32.096 --> 46:34.360
Nose, nose, nose,
noes, nose, nose, nose.

46:39.367 --> 46:40.168
Ji-hyo.

47:37.656 --> 47:39.161
- Sophie, are okay.

47:40.263 --> 47:41.658
- Yeah, I'm fine.

47:41.693 --> 47:43.033
It happens sometimes.

47:48.106 --> 47:49.204
Did you hear that?

47:49.239 --> 47:50.469
- No.

47:50.504 --> 47:51.338
What do you hear?

48:06.586 --> 48:08.322
- Sophie, there's nothing there.

48:08.357 --> 48:09.521
It's not real.

48:09.556 --> 48:11.622
It's the book, it
makes you see things.

48:11.657 --> 48:12.491
Sophie.

48:15.628 --> 48:16.693
- No, it's next to me.

48:16.728 --> 48:18.431
- No, there's
nothing there Sophie,

48:18.466 --> 48:20.400
there is nothing there.

48:22.701 --> 48:25.141
- Fuck this, I'm out of here.

48:27.640 --> 48:29.508
No, no, no, help me.

48:40.587 --> 48:41.421
- Sophie?

48:45.097 --> 48:45.722
Sophie.

48:48.529 --> 48:50.133
- Where is Sophie? Who took her?

48:52.665 --> 48:53.598
- Fuck!

48:55.041 --> 48:56.436
- "Keep reading."

48:59.111 --> 49:01.474
Maybe if we end the
game, we can help Sophie.

49:07.680 --> 49:08.613
- Let's finish this.

49:11.354 --> 49:15.422
- "She felt guilt and believed
that she could save him."

50:12.712 --> 50:13.612
- This is the last ward

50:13.647 --> 50:14.448
to be moved outta the hospital.

50:14.483 --> 50:15.746
Guys let's move.

50:26.231 --> 50:27.131
- Karla.

50:27.166 --> 50:28.330
- There's still more we can do.

50:28.365 --> 50:29.694
- That drug is just
keeping him a vegetable.

50:29.729 --> 50:32.169
- That drug is
keeping him alive.

50:32.204 --> 50:33.566
Judy?

50:33.601 --> 50:34.633
- Doctor.

50:34.668 --> 50:35.832
- We need another vial.

50:35.867 --> 50:37.207
- Well, there's none left here.

50:37.242 --> 50:38.571
Maybe in the East Wing

50:38.606 --> 50:40.771
but the places is a mess and-
- It's okay.

50:41.840 --> 50:42.674
Okay.

50:43.611 --> 50:44.445
- Thanks.

50:45.580 --> 50:47.778
- Karla, this isn't
what he wanted.

50:47.813 --> 50:50.814
Keeping him alive
isn't right, it's time.

50:52.488 --> 50:54.455
- Let's go guys.

50:54.490 --> 50:56.226
All these patients need
to be in the new site.

50:56.261 --> 50:57.722
- Wait, listen to me.

50:58.857 --> 51:00.197
- He's my brother.

51:06.601 --> 51:09.602
- I can't believe they just
left east wing like that.

52:01.557 --> 52:02.622
- Lucky last.

52:51.409 --> 52:52.243
Shit!

54:13.359 --> 54:14.050
Who's there?

54:52.860 --> 54:53.694
- Karla.

55:15.014 --> 55:16.618
- Is anybody there?

55:19.821 --> 55:20.655
Somebody?

56:13.677 --> 56:14.203
No.

58:26.172 --> 58:27.105
Let me out.

58:28.944 --> 58:31.010
Please, please, let me out.

58:42.727 --> 58:43.957
What do you want?

58:57.236 --> 58:58.070
Blake?

59:14.154 --> 59:15.252
I can't.

1:02:08.229 --> 1:02:09.162
- What happened?

1:02:10.033 --> 1:02:10.867
Is it over?

1:02:13.300 --> 1:02:15.234
- That story was about my mama.

1:02:18.272 --> 1:02:19.502
- What do you mean?

1:02:29.855 --> 1:02:31.888
- We all bled on the book.

1:02:31.923 --> 1:02:32.988
On the stories.

1:02:36.224 --> 1:02:38.323
I think our blood
is fitting the book.

1:02:38.358 --> 1:02:39.489
It's giving life to it.

1:02:40.591 --> 1:02:41.524
- I don't care.

1:02:42.494 --> 1:02:44.967
I don't care, it's over.

1:02:50.172 --> 1:02:51.941
- We're not finished.

1:02:51.976 --> 1:02:53.404
There's another story here.

1:03:01.018 --> 1:03:01.852
Mom?

1:03:13.294 --> 1:03:14.062
- No, Bea.

1:03:15.197 --> 1:03:17.197
Bea that's, she's not real, Bea.

1:03:46.591 --> 1:03:47.392
Sophie?

1:03:48.967 --> 1:03:49.966
Is that you?

1:03:51.035 --> 1:03:53.398
- My love, it hurts.

1:04:07.381 --> 1:04:08.578
- Mom, is it you?

1:04:31.603 --> 1:04:32.470
Who are you?

1:04:44.220 --> 1:04:47.452
- England,
What have you become?

1:04:48.321 --> 1:04:51.390
What has happened to
your daughters and sons?

1:05:53.388 --> 1:05:55.289
- Are we ready, Magpie.

1:05:56.226 --> 1:05:57.390
- Yes, father.

1:05:59.823 --> 1:06:02.659
- For all have sinned.

1:06:02.694 --> 1:06:06.432
For all have sinned.

1:06:06.467 --> 1:06:11.470
- For all have sinned,
but we don't know

1:06:12.005 --> 1:06:14.737
how much we've sinned.

1:06:14.772 --> 1:06:16.376
Like a fish,

1:06:16.411 --> 1:06:18.807
doesn't understand the
concept that it is swimming

1:06:18.842 --> 1:06:20.083
in the river.

1:06:21.515 --> 1:06:22.679
It surrounds us.

1:06:23.814 --> 1:06:27.090
We were born and
conceived in it.

1:06:27.125 --> 1:06:30.423
Born into this fallen world.

1:06:34.231 --> 1:06:35.329
My friends,

1:06:36.728 --> 1:06:40.598
I've decided to deviate
from my planned topic today

1:06:41.467 --> 1:06:45.405
because we have
witnessed an abomination

1:06:46.573 --> 1:06:51.213
and we must look to
God for guidance.

1:06:58.222 --> 1:06:59.848
Leviticus- 13.

1:06:59.883 --> 1:07:03.852
If a man also lie with man,
as he lies with a woman,

1:07:03.887 --> 1:07:07.229
both of them have
committed and abomination.

1:07:07.264 --> 1:07:09.165
They shall surely
be put to death

1:07:09.200 --> 1:07:11.728
and their blood
shall be upon them.

1:07:53.739 --> 1:07:56.674
What can I say to
you good people?

1:07:58.711 --> 1:08:01.448
It's right here in
black and white.

1:08:04.255 --> 1:08:07.388
Do not dishonor your bodies.

1:08:08.919 --> 1:08:12.855
And above all else,
guard your heart

1:08:13.957 --> 1:08:17.695
for everything you
do flows from it.

1:08:21.965 --> 1:08:26.869
See the tender age at
which the homosexuals

1:08:27.707 --> 1:08:28.904
prefer their conquests.

1:08:30.710 --> 1:08:34.250
We must protect your children

1:08:34.285 --> 1:08:39.288
from the lesbians, sadists,
masochists and sexual deviance.

1:08:40.720 --> 1:08:42.918
And we will protect them.

1:08:43.954 --> 1:08:46.460
Mark my words.

1:08:51.995 --> 1:08:52.928
Natural.

1:08:55.339 --> 1:08:56.833
They used to say it's natural.

1:08:59.277 --> 1:09:02.476
But they learned a hard lesson.

1:09:02.511 --> 1:09:04.412
Didn't they friends.

1:09:21.596 --> 1:09:26.434
Because eventually the
river of moral decay ran dry

1:09:26.469 --> 1:09:28.931
just like the black
in the ground.

1:09:28.966 --> 1:09:31.835
And nature had her revenge

1:09:31.870 --> 1:09:36.873
and God spoke to
us who could hear.

1:10:12.647 --> 1:10:16.880
Yet, even after all this,
we love the abominations.

1:10:20.017 --> 1:10:21.819
We do not hate them.

1:10:21.854 --> 1:10:24.789
We do what is fair and right

1:10:24.824 --> 1:10:27.297
and try to help them
back to the path

1:10:27.332 --> 1:10:30.630
because God cannot
love them as they are.

1:11:21.518 --> 1:11:22.352
Yes.

1:11:23.080 --> 1:11:24.783
Yes, that's it.

1:11:24.818 --> 1:11:27.588
Drink from the blood of Christ.

1:11:27.623 --> 1:11:29.425
Let it purify us.

1:11:48.809 --> 1:11:50.105
Thank you, daughter.

1:11:54.419 --> 1:11:56.353
Revelations,- 7-8,

1:11:57.554 --> 1:12:00.148
he who overcomes will
inherit these things

1:12:00.183 --> 1:12:04.361
and I will be His God
and he will be my people.

1:12:05.089 --> 1:12:06.957
But, for the cowardly

1:12:06.992 --> 1:12:10.631
and unbelieving and
abominable and murderers

1:12:10.666 --> 1:12:13.502
and immoral persons and
saucerers and idolaters

1:12:14.670 --> 1:12:17.737
and all liars, their
part will be in the lake

1:12:17.772 --> 1:12:22.104
that burns with fire
and brimstone

1:12:24.108 --> 1:12:27.615
Which is the second
death.

1:15:42.911 --> 1:15:43.745
- Ethan.

1:15:49.379 --> 1:15:51.016
Sophie, wait.

1:15:51.051 --> 1:15:52.314
- Bea, I'm scared.

1:15:52.349 --> 1:15:53.920
- Let him go.

1:15:53.955 --> 1:15:55.889
- She wants pure blood.

1:16:00.060 --> 1:16:00.894
- No.

1:16:25.052 --> 1:16:26.953
Oh, she's coming now.

1:16:30.959 --> 1:16:31.793
- Sophie.

1:16:47.371 --> 1:16:49.404
Go upstairs and
hide in your room.

1:16:49.439 --> 1:16:50.944
- No, I wanna stay with you.

1:16:50.979 --> 1:16:51.813
- Go.

1:19:20.029 --> 1:19:20.929
- Can I come now?

1:19:22.295 --> 1:19:24.867
- Yes, you can come now.
