00:13.847 --> 00:16.182
-So, what are we doing here?

00:16.224 --> 00:17.851
Is this about all those bones?

00:17.892 --> 00:21.146
-No, Gran. Ugga's unveiling
a new sculpture. [laughs]

00:21.187 --> 00:22.355
-Wait, what bones?

00:22.397 --> 00:24.274
-I didn't say bones!
<i>You</i>said bones!

00:24.315 --> 00:26.943
-Let's hope this sculpture
goes better than her last few.

00:26.985 --> 00:28.987
[sleepy humming]

00:29.029 --> 00:30.864
[grumbles, gasps]

00:30.905 --> 00:32.824
-Ah!
-Like it? It's your dad's head.

00:32.866 --> 00:33.867
-Mom!

00:33.908 --> 00:35.785
-[chewing]
-UGGA: Surprise!

00:35.827 --> 00:37.037
DAWN:
Ah!

00:37.078 --> 00:38.788
-I'm serving up
your dad's head on a plate.

00:38.830 --> 00:39.998
-Ugga! Why?

00:40.040 --> 00:41.833
[humming]

00:41.875 --> 00:43.668
[loud chewing]

00:43.710 --> 00:44.586
THUNK:
Ah!

00:44.627 --> 00:46.588
Mom! Stop carving heads!

00:46.629 --> 00:48.006
-This one is pretty
good, though.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.507
-Paws off, grab-bag!

00:49.549 --> 00:52.761
-[sighs] I miss those
crazy heads.

00:52.802 --> 00:54.179
[Ugga clears throat]

00:54.220 --> 00:56.848
-Art is the intersection

00:56.890 --> 00:58.892
of truth and beauty.

00:58.933 --> 01:00.143
An emotional journey.

01:00.185 --> 01:02.062
That's why I've placed leaves

01:02.103 --> 01:04.564
next to your seats to
wipe your tears.

01:04.606 --> 01:07.734
When I started this sculpture,
I was alone.

01:07.776 --> 01:09.903
Silence was my compass.

01:09.944 --> 01:11.237
So was <i>this</i>compass.

01:11.279 --> 01:13.573
-Hey! That's <i>my</i>compass!
-UGGA: But then,

01:13.615 --> 01:15.158
inspiration struck!

01:15.200 --> 01:17.327
It is my honor to present...

01:17.369 --> 01:18.912
-Sorry I'm late.
I was making some snacks

01:18.953 --> 01:20.455
for your big unveiling.

01:20.497 --> 01:22.665
-Oh. Thanks, Hope.
As I was saying...

01:22.707 --> 01:24.417
-THUNK: What is that smell?
-[Ugga grumbles]

01:24.459 --> 01:26.503
It smells like good
things taste. Mm...

01:26.544 --> 01:28.630
-It's just my papaynapple
surprise

01:28.672 --> 01:31.591
for when Ugga's done.
Sorry. Go ahead, Ugga.

01:31.633 --> 01:35.261
-Thanks. And now! I
present to you...

01:35.303 --> 01:36.930
-Ooh, what's the
surprise, Hope?

01:36.971 --> 01:38.682
-You'll have to wait
to find out.

01:38.723 --> 01:39.933
-[Ugga clears throat]
May I continue?

01:39.974 --> 01:41.643
-Of course. Sorry, Uggs.

01:41.685 --> 01:43.061
-I give to you...

01:43.103 --> 01:45.355
<i>Papaynapple At Rest!</i>

01:45.397 --> 01:46.773
GRUG:
I love it!

01:46.815 --> 01:48.608
Mm...

01:48.650 --> 01:49.526
[loud chewing]

01:49.567 --> 01:52.153
-[laughing]
-BOTH: Mm...

01:52.195 --> 01:54.114
-I think I'm gonna cry.

01:54.155 --> 01:56.074
-Way ahead of you. Mm...

02:29.607 --> 02:31.317
-Pretty sure
she thinks she's Hope.

02:31.359 --> 02:32.902
Wait, wait, wait. Who
do <i>you</i>think she is?

02:32.944 --> 02:35.613
-I can't believe that she would
steal my thunder like that,

02:35.655 --> 02:38.074
showing up with snacks
to my big sculpture show?

02:38.116 --> 02:39.826
Besides, I made snacks.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.995
-That's a snack? I thought
it was paint.

02:42.037 --> 02:43.371
-Grug!
-Sorry.

02:43.413 --> 02:46.291
Ugga, you're a great artist,
and Hope's a great cook.

02:46.332 --> 02:47.459
But the thing is people

02:47.500 --> 02:49.169
are always gonna
like food more than art

02:49.210 --> 02:51.671
because you can't eat art.
Or can you...

02:51.713 --> 02:54.007
-[growling, gnawing]
-UGGA: That's not the point.

02:54.049 --> 02:55.508
The point is I <i>can</i>cook.

02:55.550 --> 02:58.178
I mean, I cooked all the time
before we got to the farm.

02:58.219 --> 03:00.513
-You like my cooking, don't you?
-Mm...

03:00.555 --> 03:02.349
-Hope you guys like honey ribs!

03:02.390 --> 03:05.352
[straining, grunting]

03:05.393 --> 03:06.519
Mm. Too sticky?

03:06.561 --> 03:09.105
-Glue isn't supposed
to be this sticky.

03:09.147 --> 03:10.774
-[forceful]:
Mm!

03:10.815 --> 03:14.361
-Roasted mahi-mahyena,
nice and fresh.

03:14.402 --> 03:16.863
-[roaring]
-[screaming]

03:16.905 --> 03:18.198

03:18.239 --> 03:19.449
-Hot chili!

03:19.491 --> 03:21.326
-[hissing, bubbling]
-It's a little spicy.

-Uh, what?

03:28.458 --> 03:30.543
-You like my cooking,
don't you?

03:30.585 --> 03:33.463
-I sure do, honey!
-Great! Then, help yourself.

03:33.505 --> 03:35.048
-Uh, paint? Oh, no thanks.

03:35.090 --> 03:37.550
I am stuffed!

03:38.134 --> 03:39.886
Mm. [chewing]

03:39.928 --> 03:41.846
Oh, so good. Mm!

03:41.888 --> 03:43.807
-Ugh!

03:43.848 --> 03:46.393
-Everyone enjoying
their Hope Roast?

-Mm...

-Mm...

-Mm, mm, mmm!

03:50.563 --> 03:52.273
-Thunk? What do <i>you</i>think?

03:52.315 --> 03:55.610
-Hope, you've outdone
yourself this time.

03:55.652 --> 03:58.113
I'm giving this... four yums.

03:58.154 --> 03:59.948
-That's the most yums
you've ever given

03:59.989 --> 04:01.908
one of my meals. Thank you.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.077
-Oh no, Hope. Thank <i>you.</i>

04:04.119 --> 04:05.912
-And what about you, Ugga?

04:05.954 --> 04:08.248
-You've been awfully quiet.
-PHIL: Indeed.

04:08.289 --> 04:10.166
I didn't hear a single "mm."

04:10.208 --> 04:11.167
Ugga,

04:11.209 --> 04:12.585
is your "mm" broken?

04:12.627 --> 04:14.295
-[laughs] No. I was
just thinking

04:14.337 --> 04:16.381
how unfair it is
that you have to do

04:16.423 --> 04:18.425
-all the cooking
around here, Hope!

04:18.466 --> 04:19.342
-I don't mind.

04:19.384 --> 04:20.802
-Me neither! [chomp]

04:20.844 --> 04:21.970
Mm, mm, mmm!

04:22.012 --> 04:24.431
-I love cooking!
It's how I express myself.

04:24.472 --> 04:27.267
-Sure, but maybe we could
start sharing the duties.

04:27.308 --> 04:30.020
I know my family misses
<i>my</i>cave cooking.

04:30.812 --> 04:32.814
-She's coming!

04:32.856 --> 04:34.274
-So? You like my stew?

04:34.315 --> 04:37.569
-[forced]:
Mm-hmm! [swallows] Love it!

04:37.610 --> 04:40.947
-[nervous]: I... think
it's a great idea, Mom.

04:40.989 --> 04:43.324
-[forced]:
Yes. A great idea. Right, Thunk?

04:43.366 --> 04:45.452
-Yep. Great idea.

04:45.493 --> 04:48.371
[quiet]:
I was lying. Pretty smooth, huh?

04:48.413 --> 04:50.290
-I'd rather bring
back the heads!

04:50.331 --> 04:51.541
-Are you sure you want to?

04:51.583 --> 04:54.294
There's a lot more to cooking
than smashing

04:54.336 --> 04:56.671
or punching or kicking
or whatever it is you do.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.715
-Yeah, Hope. Thanks.
I know that.

04:58.757 --> 05:00.633
Because I can cook. In fact,

05:00.675 --> 05:02.135
-why don't I make
dinner tomorrow?

05:02.177 --> 05:03.720
-Uh, sounds great.

05:03.762 --> 05:06.181
And I'll make a backup dinner
in case we need it.

05:06.222 --> 05:07.682
-We won't need it.
-Right.

05:07.724 --> 05:10.101
But I'll make one anyway,
just in case.

05:14.856 --> 05:17.734
-Okay! It's just a roast.
How hard can it be?

05:17.776 --> 05:19.986
-Strawpearies? In a roast?

05:20.028 --> 05:21.946
Little on the sweet side,
don't you think?

05:21.988 --> 05:24.407
-Obviously. I'm just, uh,
getting in the zone!

05:24.449 --> 05:26.117
You know, the cooking zone!

05:26.159 --> 05:27.285
-Hm. And you definitely

05:27.327 --> 05:28.703
don't wanna
use a lemonectarine.

05:28.745 --> 05:30.288
-Hope, do you mind?
-Sorry, Ugga.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.082
You're right.
I'll just let you cook,

05:32.123 --> 05:34.167
and I won't say another word.

05:34.209 --> 05:36.544
Even though adding a burnip
is a huge mistake.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.588
-You're right, Hope!
Thank you so much.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.173
I mean, what was I thinking?

05:40.215 --> 05:42.092
-It's my pleasure! Happy to--

05:42.133 --> 05:43.718
Hot burnip! Hot burnip!

05:43.760 --> 05:45.845
-Are you sure you don't
mind me cooking in your lab?

05:45.887 --> 05:47.972
-Not at all! And everything
you need

05:48.014 --> 05:50.767
to create a culinary masterpiece
is at your disposal.

05:50.809 --> 05:54.270
-Thanks, Phil. You really
didn't have to do all this.

05:54.312 --> 05:56.106
-Wait, why are you
doing all this?

05:56.147 --> 05:57.482
-Long ago, before you

05:57.524 --> 05:59.484
and the rest of your herd
lumbered onto the farm,

05:59.526 --> 06:01.277
I offered to make dinner.

06:01.319 --> 06:03.947
<i>I spent hours</i>
<i>crafting my meal.</i>

06:03.988 --> 06:05.782
<i>But when I served it,</i>
<i>Hope scoffed.</i>

06:05.824 --> 06:06.908
<i>She said there were...</i>

06:06.950 --> 06:09.494
[deep, distorted]:
<i>too many flavors.</i>

06:09.536 --> 06:10.704
Which is absurd!

06:10.745 --> 06:12.956
The more flavors
there are, the better!

06:12.997 --> 06:16.584
[throat clear]
You are my chance at redemption!

06:16.626 --> 06:18.044
-Feels like a lot
of pressure. Yeah.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.338
And I'm not sure it's gonna
help me make this roast.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.590
-Forget the roast.
That's Hope turf.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.718
<i>You</i>need to plant your fork

06:24.759 --> 06:26.428
in uncharted territory!

06:26.469 --> 06:28.304
If <i>we're</i>going to defeat Hope,

06:28.346 --> 06:30.306
we'll need something unexpected!

06:30.348 --> 06:32.934
But also something delicious.

06:32.976 --> 06:34.352
* *

06:34.394 --> 06:37.063
-Something with bananas?
-Yes...

06:37.105 --> 06:38.273
Bananas.

06:39.607 --> 06:41.317
-[gasps] Oh.

06:41.359 --> 06:44.154
You're not gonna stand there
and watch me cook, are you?

06:44.195 --> 06:45.697
-Of course not.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.158
Someone has to draw
Hope's attention elsewhere.

06:48.199 --> 06:51.327
She can never learn
of my involvement,

06:51.369 --> 06:54.372
but just know I'm
here, with you!

06:54.414 --> 06:56.583
Watching! Waiting! Pacing!

06:56.624 --> 06:59.377
Pinning all of my hopes on you!

06:59.419 --> 07:01.004

isn't too--

[coughs] Wow.

07:37.332 --> 07:39.876
That burnt hair flavor
really sneaks up on you.

07:39.918 --> 07:41.920
Oh, sorry, guys.
I know it's bad.

07:41.961 --> 07:43.338

07:43.380 --> 07:44.798

07:46.758 --> 07:49.678
Maybe all it needed
was a little heat?

07:49.719 --> 07:52.555
[coughing] Nope.
Now, it's worse.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.891
But no problem! I'll
make something else.

07:54.933 --> 07:57.018
[sniffs] Woo! Just need to get
rid of this mess

07:57.060 --> 07:59.562
before everything smells
like burnt banana. [laughs]

get better?

08:12.325 --> 08:13.368
Hm.

08:13.410 --> 08:15.620
[gagging] No. So much worse.

08:15.662 --> 08:18.456
Why does it taste like
shrimpossum sweat?

Ugh. [sniffing]

08:20.458 --> 08:22.585
What is that?
[sniffing] Hm.

08:22.627 --> 08:23.837
[sniffing]

08:23.878 --> 08:25.630
-[ooking]
-Punch monkeys?!

08:25.672 --> 08:27.716
[screeching]

08:27.757 --> 08:28.883
I'm not here to fight.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.719
I just want to know
what you're eating.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.054
-[monkey grunts]
-It smells amazing.

08:33.096 --> 08:34.014
[ooking]

08:34.639 --> 08:37.267
Mm. Mm? Mm!

08:37.308 --> 08:39.185
This is the best thing
I've ever tasted!

08:39.227 --> 08:40.770
-What is it?
-[ooking]

08:40.812 --> 08:43.273
Punch pie? Well, you should
call it perfect pie.

08:43.314 --> 08:44.315
[angry ooks]

08:44.357 --> 08:45.859
Fine. Ouch.
Stick with punch pie.

08:45.900 --> 08:48.278
The point is, it's delicious.

08:48.319 --> 08:49.612
-Mm!
-[ooking]

08:49.654 --> 08:51.990
This? Oh, this? This
is, uh, garbage.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.783
I actually came out
here to bury it.

08:53.825 --> 08:55.076
[excited ooks]

08:55.118 --> 08:57.829
Yeah, I-I wouldn't, uh,
do that if I were you.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.706
[excited screeching]

08:59.748 --> 09:01.624
It was never gonna be better
than Hope's cooking,

09:01.666 --> 09:03.209
but at least <i>someone</i>likes it.

09:03.251 --> 09:06.171
If only I could make something
as delicious as punch pie.

09:06.212 --> 09:09.632
<i>That</i>would show Hope.
Huh? Hm...

09:09.674 --> 09:12.218
Hey, punch monkeys.
Let's make a deal.

09:12.260 --> 09:13.553
* *

09:13.595 --> 09:15.972
-Well, where is she?
Why is this taking so long?

09:16.014 --> 09:17.307
-Because cooking is hard,

09:17.349 --> 09:19.392
especially when you don't know
what you're doing.

09:19.434 --> 09:20.894
-[stomach growling]
-PHIL: Hm?

09:20.935 --> 09:22.103
-I hope Mom gets here soon.

09:22.145 --> 09:23.938
Dad's stomach
is about to lose it.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.982
-Actually, that was <i>my</i>stomach.

09:26.024 --> 09:27.984
-[whispers]: You're being rude.
-[stomach growls]

09:28.026 --> 09:30.195
-Keep your shirt on, Carlos.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.030
You think Mom's dinner
will be good?

09:32.072 --> 09:33.823
-Of course, it'll be good!

09:33.865 --> 09:36.242
I taught her everything
she knows about food,

09:36.284 --> 09:38.912
especially food that doesn't
wanna be caught

09:38.953 --> 09:40.413
and turned into food!

09:40.455 --> 09:43.208
-I think Mom is gonna try
really hard to make it good,

09:43.249 --> 09:44.834
<i>but</i>in case it isn't,
bite this,

09:44.876 --> 09:47.128
-and you won't taste anything.
-For how long?

09:47.170 --> 09:49.047
-Good question.
-I know. So, how long?

09:49.089 --> 09:50.590
-Long enough to get
you through this dinner.

09:50.632 --> 09:52.217
-Hm.

09:52.258 --> 09:53.843
[chomp, chewing]

09:53.885 --> 09:56.930
-Ah!
-[yelps]

09:56.971 --> 09:59.683
-You don't need lava peppers.
We've got my backup dinner.

09:59.724 --> 10:02.018
You can't be too prepared
when preparing dinner.

10:02.060 --> 10:05.230
-Excellent idea, dear!
I'm sure Ugga's cuisine

10:05.271 --> 10:08.274
will pale in comparison
to yours.

10:08.316 --> 10:10.402
Or it will avenge me...

10:10.443 --> 10:13.613
-Dinner is served!

10:13.655 --> 10:14.614
-[lisping]: What is it?

10:14.656 --> 10:16.700
-I'm calling it Ugga Pie!

10:16.741 --> 10:18.535
-I'll go get my backup dinner.

10:18.576 --> 10:19.536
-[Ugga clears throat]
-Mm?

10:19.577 --> 10:20.620
[angry growl]

10:20.662 --> 10:22.497
Mm! [nervous laugh]

10:22.539 --> 10:24.874
-[sniffing] Hm...

10:25.709 --> 10:27.711
Mm... Hm?

10:27.752 --> 10:29.713
Whoa! Mm!

10:29.754 --> 10:32.716
My life is now divided
into two parts!

10:32.757 --> 10:36.219
Before Ugga Pie and after.
It's delicious!

10:36.261 --> 10:38.596
-[sniffing, chewing]

10:38.638 --> 10:40.974
[lisps]:
It is? I can't taste a thing.

10:41.016 --> 10:42.267
Did I even take a bite?

10:42.308 --> 10:44.644
-Yeah. That's the lava pepper.
It'll wear off!

10:44.686 --> 10:46.312
-I think.
-You think?

10:46.354 --> 10:48.565
[satisfied humming]

10:48.606 --> 10:51.234
-Honey, you did it.
You just did it.

10:51.276 --> 10:52.902
[satisfied chewing]

10:52.944 --> 10:54.988
-Smoky, earthy,

10:55.030 --> 10:57.157
and just a hint of sweet.

10:57.198 --> 11:00.577
I've never tasted anything
like it. Five yums!

11:00.618 --> 11:03.496
-[gasps] Five yums? Let me try.

11:03.538 --> 11:06.332
[noisy eating]

11:06.374 --> 11:07.250
-So?

11:07.292 --> 11:09.878
* *

11:09.919 --> 11:12.589
-[increasing intensity]:
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm...

11:12.630 --> 11:15.091
[closed mouth scream]

11:15.133 --> 11:15.967
[swallows]

11:16.009 --> 11:17.260
-[sighs] It's fine.

11:17.302 --> 11:19.888
-No! It's perfect! [gasps] Ooh!

11:19.929 --> 11:21.931
Maybe you should call
it perfect pie!

11:21.973 --> 11:24.267
-Mom, can you make dinner
tomorrow night?

11:24.309 --> 11:27.103
-And the night after that?
-Let's not push our luck.

11:27.145 --> 11:29.022
I mean, she made <i>one</i>good meal.

11:29.064 --> 11:31.024
It could be a fluke!
No offense, Ugga.

11:31.066 --> 11:33.943
-None taken. And I'd love
to make dinner tomorrow night.

11:33.985 --> 11:36.071
Sorry about your backup
dinner, Hope.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.906
Maybe Chunky will eat it...

11:37.947 --> 11:41.368
[overlapping laughter, jeering]

11:41.409 --> 11:42.869
* *

11:42.911 --> 11:44.412
-In your face, Hope!

11:44.454 --> 11:45.789
-Yes...
-[angry growl]

11:45.830 --> 11:48.375
Yes-terday's dinner
was also delicious?

11:48.416 --> 11:51.252
[grumbles, sighs]

11:51.294 --> 11:54.089
-[aggressive chewing]
Bravo, Ugga!

11:54.130 --> 11:56.132
Redemption is within
reach. [sighs]

11:56.174 --> 11:58.093
I can't wait to see
what masterpiece

11:58.134 --> 12:00.428
-you create next.
-Me neither.

12:00.470 --> 12:01.429
* *

12:01.471 --> 12:02.555
[ooking]

12:02.597 --> 12:04.140
Oh!

12:04.182 --> 12:04.974
[laughs]

12:05.016 --> 12:07.394
-Ugga Burgers!
-[gasping]

12:07.435 --> 12:09.020
-[chomping]
-ALL: Mm!

12:09.062 --> 12:10.647
-[overly satisfied]:
<i>Mm!</i>

12:10.689 --> 12:12.649
-[ooking]
-[gasps]

12:12.691 --> 12:13.858
-Ugg's Nuggs!

12:13.900 --> 12:16.152
ALL:
Mm!

12:16.194 --> 12:17.237
-Ugh...

12:19.864 --> 12:22.992
[ooking]

12:23.034 --> 12:24.994
-[sniffing] And...

12:25.036 --> 12:27.580
nachos! By Ugga!

12:28.790 --> 12:31.042
-Mm! [laughs]

12:31.084 --> 12:33.545
BOTH:
Mm...

12:33.586 --> 12:36.840
[overlapping satisfied groans]

12:36.881 --> 12:38.633
[chomp, ecstatic groaning]

12:38.675 --> 12:42.178
[overjoyed laughter]

12:42.220 --> 12:44.597
[crying]

12:44.639 --> 12:47.517
-I've never dreamed that
food could taste this good!

12:47.559 --> 12:49.102
-But here we are,

12:49.144 --> 12:51.688
living the dream you never had.

12:51.730 --> 12:53.023
[both crying]

12:53.064 --> 12:55.900
[celebratory vocalizing]

12:55.942 --> 12:58.111
-What is even happening?!

12:58.153 --> 13:02.198
[laughter, cheering]

13:02.240 --> 13:03.199
[growls]

13:03.241 --> 13:04.451
[ooking]

13:04.492 --> 13:08.038
-One order of freshly stomped
bananas for you.

13:08.079 --> 13:09.247
So, what do you have
for me today?

13:09.289 --> 13:10.874
Punch pancakes? Punch pasta?

13:10.915 --> 13:13.251
Or maybe punch...
stomped bananas?

13:13.293 --> 13:16.379
-I don't understand.
-[ooking]

13:16.421 --> 13:18.923
-You figured out the recipe?
But how?

13:20.425 --> 13:22.761
[monkeys shrieking]

13:22.802 --> 13:24.471
* *

13:24.512 --> 13:26.014
[shriek]

13:26.723 --> 13:28.433
[curious ooks]

13:29.893 --> 13:31.728
[excited chattering]

13:31.770 --> 13:33.938
Ha! That's not the
recipe at all!

13:33.980 --> 13:36.566
<i>Because</i>you're missing
the secret ingredient.

13:36.608 --> 13:37.567
[ook]

13:37.609 --> 13:38.735
[boiling]

13:38.777 --> 13:41.237
Oh. You discovered the
secret ingredient.

13:41.279 --> 13:42.530
But what am I supposed to do?

13:42.572 --> 13:45.283
My family is expecting
a delicious meal tonight!

13:45.325 --> 13:48.203
-[ooking]
-What are you doing? Wait! Wait!

13:48.244 --> 13:50.580
Are you closing an imaginary
door on me?

13:50.622 --> 13:52.290
-[lock clicking]
-Huh?

13:52.332 --> 13:53.958
-[key clatters]
-And tossing away the key?

13:54.000 --> 13:56.753
-[banging on door]
-We had a deal! [sighs]

13:56.795 --> 13:58.588
You know what? I don't need you!

13:58.630 --> 14:02.258
I'll just whip up my own Ugga
special! And it'll be amazing!

14:02.300 --> 14:04.636
[echoing]:
<i>Because I'm an amazing cook!</i>

14:05.679 --> 14:07.013
[crying]

14:07.055 --> 14:08.431
I'm a terrible cook.

14:08.473 --> 14:10.517
I don't even think this is food.

14:10.558 --> 14:11.893
-There you are, Ugga!

14:11.935 --> 14:13.937
We're all anxiously
awaiting your next incredible...

14:13.978 --> 14:16.189
Billowing bullruses!
What is that?

14:16.231 --> 14:17.691
And can it sense body heat?

14:17.732 --> 14:19.984
-It's dinner, Phil.
'Cause I'm a terrible cook.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.945
-Nonsense. I've tasted
your dishes.

14:21.986 --> 14:24.572
Each one is better
than the last.

14:24.614 --> 14:26.408
[sighs, whimpers]

14:26.449 --> 14:28.618
-I didn't make that food.
The punch monkeys did.

14:28.660 --> 14:30.829
And now they've cut me
off! What do I do?

14:30.870 --> 14:32.372
-What do I do?!
-[groaning]

14:32.414 --> 14:35.000
-You'll do what you must.
Because you're Ugga.

14:35.041 --> 14:37.752
You're fearless, brave,
invincible!

14:37.794 --> 14:39.129
And if Hope finds out,

14:39.170 --> 14:40.672
she'll destroy you.

14:40.714 --> 14:44.175
-You're right. Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.177
I know what to do!

14:46.219 --> 14:47.846
-[gurgling]
-Hm...

Release me! [screaming]

This is <i>my</i>body! You
can't have it!

15:20.211 --> 15:21.671
-Oh! It's <i>you.</i>

15:21.713 --> 15:24.549
Almost took your braid-holder
off, braids.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.176
-Teach me!

15:26.217 --> 15:28.887
-Fine! The thing about
hiding bones is you gotta--

15:28.928 --> 15:30.638
-What? No! Teach
me how to cook.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.432
You said you taught Ugga
<i>everything</i>she knows,

15:32.474 --> 15:34.351
and I wanna know everything
Ugga knows!

15:34.392 --> 15:36.186
-I don't know how to cook!

15:36.227 --> 15:38.438
-But you said--
-I say a lot of things.

15:38.480 --> 15:41.483
You can't hold me to what
comes out of my word cave.

15:41.524 --> 15:44.194
And if you want to know
how to cook like Ugga,

15:44.235 --> 15:47.197
why don't you ask her?
Just saw her in the woods.

15:47.238 --> 15:49.616
-The woods?
-I never said she
was in the woods!

15:49.657 --> 15:51.409
-You <i>just</i>said she
was in the woods.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.620
-Like I said, I say
a lot of things!

15:53.661 --> 15:55.955
That doesn't mean I
said 'em! [groans]

15:55.997 --> 15:57.749

15:57.791 --> 16:01.920

the imaginary door on me!

-We had a deal!

16:12.472 --> 16:15.183
-My Ugg Rolls!
-Ugga! Are you okay?

16:15.225 --> 16:17.227
-Hope? What are you doing here?

16:17.268 --> 16:19.938
-I was looking for you,
and I saw everything.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.523
-Uh, everything?

16:21.564 --> 16:24.067
-Everything.
-Well, I guess that's that.

16:24.109 --> 16:25.819
To be honest, I'm kind
of glad it's over.

16:25.860 --> 16:28.071
-Oh, it's just getting started.
-[knuckles crack]

16:28.113 --> 16:29.823
-Yeah. I should have
seen this coming.

16:29.864 --> 16:32.075
-First, those awful
punch monkeys
steal your Ugg Rolls,

16:32.117 --> 16:33.660
and then, when you
tried to get them back,

16:33.702 --> 16:35.495
those little monsters
took them again!

16:35.537 --> 16:38.248
Those Ugg Rolls looked amazing,
by the way.

16:38.289 --> 16:40.625
-Wait, you think that...
I mean, yes.

16:40.667 --> 16:43.920
Yes! They stole the
food that I made.

16:43.962 --> 16:45.964
So, that means
I don't have anything

16:46.006 --> 16:47.465
for dinner tonight. I'm sorry.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.884
-No, I'm the one who's sorry.

16:49.926 --> 16:51.386
I underestimated you.

16:51.428 --> 16:53.263
And you will have
something to serve

16:53.304 --> 16:55.432
because we're getting
your food back!

16:55.473 --> 16:56.099
-We are?

16:56.141 --> 16:57.517
* *

16:57.559 --> 16:58.685
-I wonder what Mom's
making tonight.

16:58.727 --> 17:01.062
-Ooh! I hope she's making
Ugga Pie again.

17:01.104 --> 17:02.355
That lava pepper
finally wore off,

17:02.397 --> 17:04.274
and I'd love
to actually taste it.

17:04.315 --> 17:05.942
-Ugga Pie? Again? [scoffs]

17:05.984 --> 17:08.445
I don't know if I can handle
that much deliciousness.

17:08.486 --> 17:10.572
Oh, who am I kidding?
Of course, I can!

17:10.613 --> 17:12.782
-Oh, no. Ugga Pie was
her early stuff.

17:12.824 --> 17:16.286
Her new stuff is <i>much</i>
more experimental.

17:16.327 --> 17:18.830
-I mean, nachos?
-[imitates explosion]

17:18.872 --> 17:21.166
-Well, whatever it is,
I hope she gets here soon.

17:21.207 --> 17:22.959
I'm so hungry, I could
eat my hand.

17:23.001 --> 17:24.169
-Dad, please don't.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.046
It'll just get stuck again
like last time.

17:26.087 --> 17:27.255
-[muffled]: <i>Too late.</i>

17:27.297 --> 17:28.506
-Maybe Mom can make
us something

17:28.548 --> 17:30.008
to snack on while we wait.

17:30.050 --> 17:32.052
-Where is Mom?
-GRAN: No idea!

17:32.093 --> 17:33.553
Complete mystery!

17:33.595 --> 17:35.472
Except I saw her go
into the woods

17:35.513 --> 17:38.308
after I told her
I saw Ugga going into the woods.

17:38.350 --> 17:40.477
-The woods?
But if Ugga's in the woods...

17:40.518 --> 17:42.812
-And Hope's in the woods...

17:42.854 --> 17:44.189
-Who's gonna make dinner?

17:44.230 --> 17:46.316
-We're gonna die!

17:46.358 --> 17:48.401
[screaming]

17:48.443 --> 17:51.154
-Re! Claim! Your! Sanity!
-[grunting]

17:51.196 --> 17:53.448
No one's! Going! To die!

17:53.490 --> 17:56.368
Because <i>I'm</i>going
to make dinner.

17:56.409 --> 17:59.829
-We're gonna die! [screaming]

18:01.915 --> 18:03.375
[monkeys ooking]

18:03.416 --> 18:05.794
HOPE: Just look at them.
Filthy little thieves.

18:05.835 --> 18:07.837
You should be ashamed
of yourselves!

18:07.879 --> 18:09.589
-You know they can't
hear you, right?

18:09.631 --> 18:12.425
-I hope not. I'm just pumping
myself up! Getting in the zone!

18:12.467 --> 18:14.302
-Look, I appreciate
what you're doing,

18:14.344 --> 18:16.096
but I think we should
just go home.

18:16.137 --> 18:17.931
-Too late! I'm in
the zone! Woo!

18:17.972 --> 18:21.393
-Okay. But, you know, I think
I'm gonna stick to sculpting.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.436
Cooking really is <i>your</i>
thing anyway.

18:23.478 --> 18:26.064
-Don't you dare say that.
You're an amazing cook.

18:26.106 --> 18:27.273
Maybe even better than me.

18:27.315 --> 18:29.109
And I know how much
time and effort

18:29.150 --> 18:30.610
goes into making a
delicious meal.

18:30.652 --> 18:32.779
They are not going to
take that away from you!

18:32.821 --> 18:34.239
-Wow, Hope.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.366
That's really nice of you,
but I have to say something.

18:36.408 --> 18:39.411
-We both do! We have to send
these bullies a message.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.329
So let's teach these
punch monkeys

18:41.371 --> 18:43.081
what punching really is!

18:43.123 --> 18:44.749
[screaming]

18:44.791 --> 18:48.086
-I really need to start
coming clean faster.

18:48.128 --> 18:51.297
[monkeys ooking, chattering]

18:51.339 --> 18:54.968
-Hyah! Hello, punch
monkeys. Surprised?

18:55.010 --> 18:56.344
Well, you shouldn't be.

18:56.386 --> 18:58.513
I saw you take my friend's
Ugg Rolls,

18:58.555 --> 19:02.142
and I'm here to take 'em back!
You can try to stop me,

19:02.183 --> 19:04.310
but you won't!

19:04.352 --> 19:06.563
-[screech]
-In a few moons,

19:06.604 --> 19:09.065
if you still feel punchy
about this,

19:09.107 --> 19:10.400
I'll be waiting.

19:10.442 --> 19:13.153
-[cracks knuckles]
-[ooking]

19:13.194 --> 19:15.030
Forgot the Ugg Rolls.

19:15.071 --> 19:16.740
[grunts]

19:16.781 --> 19:19.492
[ook, growl]

19:19.534 --> 19:22.704
-Hope! You're alive!
And you have the Ugg Rolls!

19:22.746 --> 19:24.748
-Of course. I told you
I'd get them back.

19:24.789 --> 19:27.584
To be honest, I think
the punch monkeys were relieved.

19:27.625 --> 19:29.502
Every crime is really
just a cry for help.

19:29.544 --> 19:31.212
I wouldn't be surprised
if they thank me.

19:31.254 --> 19:33.340
-They're not going
to thank you.

19:33.381 --> 19:36.134
-[thumping]
-They're gonna thump you!

19:36.176 --> 19:38.845
-Run!
-[screeching]

19:38.887 --> 19:40.513
This way!

19:40.555 --> 19:42.557
-They took your Ugga
Burgers, too?

19:42.599 --> 19:44.059
-Gimme that!
-[screech]

19:44.100 --> 19:46.019
-[Ugga grunts]
-[chattering]

19:46.061 --> 19:47.437
[panting]

19:49.522 --> 19:51.483
-And your Ugg's Nuggs?
-[chattering]

19:51.524 --> 19:53.860
-Gimme those!
-[shrieking]

19:53.902 --> 19:55.070
[panting]

19:55.111 --> 19:57.030
* *

19:57.072 --> 19:59.032
[sniffs] Ugh!
You can keep whatever that is.

19:59.074 --> 20:01.284
[shrieking]

20:01.326 --> 20:04.204
-Is that... I think
they're performing

20:04.245 --> 20:05.538
<i>-Little Red Punching Hood.</i>
-[ook]

20:05.580 --> 20:07.374
HOPE:
And they're eating your nachos!

20:07.415 --> 20:08.958
[panting]

20:09.000 --> 20:11.044
-Oh, oh...
-I'll be taking <i>those</i>,

20:11.086 --> 20:13.672
thank you very <i>much.</i>
And, spoiler alert!

20:13.713 --> 20:16.132
The granny's not
really a granny!

20:17.008 --> 20:18.093
[shriek]

20:18.134 --> 20:19.636
[panting]

20:19.678 --> 20:21.721
-We're almost there, Hope!
-We are?

20:21.763 --> 20:23.723
'Cause I can't see anything!

20:23.765 --> 20:25.183
[panting]

20:25.225 --> 20:26.351
[shriek]

20:26.393 --> 20:27.936
-Ah! [grunts]

20:27.977 --> 20:29.979
-Sorry. I was nacho-blocked.
[gasps]

20:30.021 --> 20:32.982
And those monkeys are about
to get Hope-blocked!

20:33.024 --> 20:35.235
-[sighs] Just give
me the food, Hope.

20:35.276 --> 20:36.611
-Good thinking.
I'll hold them off

20:36.653 --> 20:38.071
while you save
your culinary works of art.

20:38.113 --> 20:41.366
You monkeys thirsty?
Well, I'm gonna pour you

20:41.408 --> 20:44.035
a great big cup of Hope punch!

20:44.077 --> 20:45.745
[screaming]

20:45.787 --> 20:47.288
-[grunts]
-[shrieking]

20:47.330 --> 20:49.708
-[screaming, shrieking]
-Stop!

20:49.749 --> 20:51.584
-[groans]
-Ugga! What are you doing?

20:51.626 --> 20:54.462
-[shriek]
-I'm coming clean. [grunting]

20:55.422 --> 20:56.965
[ooking]

20:58.299 --> 20:59.217
[sighs]

20:59.259 --> 21:00.719
-[blows raspberry]
-[gasps]

21:00.760 --> 21:03.638
They didn't steal my food.
I stole theirs.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.432
-Right, after they
took it from you.

21:05.473 --> 21:07.600
-No, Hope. I never
cooked that food.

21:07.642 --> 21:09.686
I was jealous of how
everyone loved your food

21:09.728 --> 21:10.770
and ignored my sculpture.

21:10.812 --> 21:12.439
But when I tried to
make my own food,

21:12.480 --> 21:13.648
it was a disaster!

21:13.690 --> 21:15.108
So, I did what anyone would do.

21:15.150 --> 21:17.152
I traded a bucket of charred,
stomped bananas

21:17.193 --> 21:19.154
for delicious home-cooked meals
made by monkeys

21:19.195 --> 21:21.197
and passed them off as my own.

21:21.239 --> 21:22.240
I'm sorry.

21:22.282 --> 21:23.616
[gasps]

21:23.658 --> 21:25.952
-I'm so glad you can't cook.
-Huh?

21:25.994 --> 21:27.871
-You're good at so
many other things,

21:27.912 --> 21:29.956
and I hated that
you were good at this, too.

21:29.998 --> 21:32.584
-So, you're not mad?

21:32.625 --> 21:34.044
-How could I be mad?

21:34.085 --> 21:36.546
I'm great, and you're terrible.
It's a win-win!

21:36.588 --> 21:38.340
-Well, it's a win for <i>you</i>.

21:38.381 --> 21:39.883
-It's actually two wins for me.

21:39.924 --> 21:42.385
I'm a better cook,
and I forgive you.

21:42.427 --> 21:44.512
-See? Win-win.
-Oh.

21:44.554 --> 21:46.765
We should get going.
Grug probably has

21:46.806 --> 21:48.433
both his hands stuck
in his mouth by now.

21:48.475 --> 21:51.603
-[struggling]
-[Sandy laughs]

21:51.644 --> 21:52.896
-This is the last time

21:52.937 --> 21:55.231
you'll try to eat your hands,
right, Dad?

21:55.273 --> 21:57.025
-Mm-mmm.
-Ugh.

21:57.067 --> 21:59.694
-[struggling]
-Dad? Is dinner ready?

21:59.736 --> 22:01.696
I'm so hungry, <i>my</i>
hands look good.

22:01.738 --> 22:04.449
-Just putting on the garnish...

22:04.491 --> 22:06.159
[gasps] Sublime.

22:06.201 --> 22:07.660
[struggling]

22:07.702 --> 22:09.662
-Mom!
-[all gasping, cheering]

22:09.704 --> 22:10.997
GRUG:
[muffled noises]

22:11.039 --> 22:12.999
-I think what Grug is
trying to say is,

22:13.041 --> 22:15.168
we're so glad you're here,
and we're so hungry.

22:15.210 --> 22:16.086
What's for dinner?

22:16.127 --> 22:17.671
-Well, everyone, the truth is--

22:17.712 --> 22:20.674
-The truth is we're
having Ugga's Ribs.

22:20.715 --> 22:23.301
She asked me to help
her bring them in.

22:23.343 --> 22:26.513
[all eating happily]

22:26.554 --> 22:28.848
I always make a backup meal.

22:28.890 --> 22:31.267
-I hope everyone is hungry!

22:31.309 --> 22:33.895
Because dinner is... [gasps]

22:36.773 --> 22:37.857
-Hm?
-[whimpers]

22:37.899 --> 22:41.403
-[echoing]:
<i>No!</i>
