WEBVTT

00:07.485 --> 00:11.968
- The Covid-19 pandemic
came as a surprise to some,

00:12.012 --> 00:15.667
but horror films have sounded
the alarm for decades.

00:17.104 --> 00:19.454
- What "Contagion" did perfect

00:19.497 --> 00:23.240
was to show us that the
deadliest infection is fear.

00:24.415 --> 00:26.504
- It was an upsetting movie
when there was no pandemic.

00:27.853 --> 00:29.377
And it was even more upsetting
during the pandemic.

00:29.420 --> 00:30.291
[horn blaring]

00:32.293 --> 00:33.859
- I remember when we shot
"12 Monkeys,"

00:33.903 --> 00:36.079
and you'd use a "What if?"

00:37.472 --> 00:39.691
- You won't think I'm crazy when
people start dying next month.

00:39.735 --> 00:41.084
- You think it can't possibly
happen.

00:41.128 --> 00:42.651
- No...!

00:42.694 --> 00:44.087
- [screaming]

00:44.131 --> 00:46.524
- When it comes to
an infected people movie,

00:46.568 --> 00:49.092
probably my very favorite is
David Cronenberg's "Rabid."

00:50.615 --> 00:52.095
- [screaming]

00:52.139 --> 00:53.966
- The idea of sexually
transmitted diseases

00:54.010 --> 00:57.579
and sex being the thing
that destroys you.

00:57.622 --> 01:00.495
- [roaring]

01:00.538 --> 01:04.020
- "[REC]," I think,
was genuinely terrifying.

01:04.064 --> 01:07.067
- [screaming]

01:07.110 --> 01:11.332
- It was just raw
and real and felt like,

01:11.375 --> 01:14.683
oh, that could be happening
down the street, tomorrow.

01:14.726 --> 01:16.337
- [screaming]

01:16.380 --> 01:19.383
- That's the pernicious
element of a disease.

01:19.427 --> 01:22.299
All the weapons of mankind

01:22.343 --> 01:24.910
are helpless before it, you
know, you can't bomb a disease.

01:24.954 --> 01:26.042
- Oh, God!

01:28.088 --> 01:30.481
- You can't see it, you don't
know where it is or when

01:30.525 --> 01:33.005
it's present or how dangerous
it is or when it might strike.

01:34.790 --> 01:36.574
But you have to be on guard
all of the time.

01:39.142 --> 01:43.059
[eerie music]

01:58.814 --> 01:59.945
[chainsaw whirring]

02:05.864 --> 02:08.215
[dramatic music]

02:08.258 --> 02:10.826
- Horror stories are built
around our fear of threats

02:10.869 --> 02:13.611
we know exist,
but can't stop...

02:17.137 --> 02:18.834
...and the threats
we don't know about

02:18.877 --> 02:20.749
until it's too late.

02:23.230 --> 02:26.363
Pathogens inspire
both kinds of fear.

02:26.407 --> 02:29.105
At first we don't know
what's killing us,

02:29.149 --> 02:32.500
then we realize an invisible
monster is on the loose,

02:32.543 --> 02:34.589
and it's coming for everyone.

02:34.632 --> 02:37.244
- [screaming]

02:37.287 --> 02:39.637
- In horror, these diseases
often come wrapped

02:39.681 --> 02:41.378
in a supernatural clothing.

02:46.557 --> 02:49.647
But when COVID-19 brought
the world to a standstill,

02:49.691 --> 02:54.522
many people sought out the films
that seemed closest to reality.

02:54.565 --> 02:56.045
- At the top of the pandemic,

02:56.088 --> 02:59.962
I was seeing
so many people online,

03:00.005 --> 03:03.095
purposely watching pandemic
and zombie movies.

03:03.139 --> 03:05.141
And that says something
about our psyche--

03:05.185 --> 03:09.058
that when we are at
our lowest point,

03:09.101 --> 03:10.973
we want to poke that.

03:11.016 --> 03:12.496
- [screaming]

03:14.106 --> 03:16.848
- "Outbreak," from 1995,

03:16.892 --> 03:19.416
follows the trail
of an Ebola-like virus

03:19.460 --> 03:21.810
brought to America
by a black market monkey.

03:24.073 --> 03:26.858
- Sirs... Mr. Motaba.

03:26.902 --> 03:28.904
- Help!
[glass shatters]

03:28.947 --> 03:30.645
Oh, God!
[screaming]

03:30.688 --> 03:32.908
- "Outbreak" is one of
the first of what you may call

03:32.951 --> 03:35.258
semi-realistic plague films.

03:35.302 --> 03:36.999
I wouldn't say entirely,
because it goes nuts

03:37.042 --> 03:38.783
in the last half hour, but it's
essentially kind of

03:38.827 --> 03:40.307
a look at how plague might
actually operate

03:40.350 --> 03:43.658
in the modern world.
[rotors whirring]

03:43.701 --> 03:46.182
And I think it was a really
underrated film because

03:46.226 --> 03:48.532
that was the first time
a lot of moviegoers thought,

03:48.576 --> 03:50.491
"Oh, yeah, this
actually could happen."

03:50.534 --> 03:52.275
- [screeching]

03:52.319 --> 03:54.625
- You had the monkey, you had
the sneezing in the theater.

03:54.669 --> 03:56.279
- [coughing and sneezing]

03:56.323 --> 03:59.978
- And you had these,
these visual expressions that

04:00.022 --> 04:01.937
taught people, like, oh,

04:01.980 --> 04:04.156
[bleep], it's actually dangerous

04:04.200 --> 04:08.291
to be a human being
and have lungs

04:08.335 --> 04:11.163
that can absorb bacteria

04:11.207 --> 04:13.644
in a way that can destroy
our entire system.

04:15.733 --> 04:17.126
- Don't tell me
when I need sleep, Casey,

04:17.169 --> 04:18.736
I don't tell you
when you need sleep.

04:21.391 --> 04:24.612
- For every person
who gets sick,

04:24.655 --> 04:27.092
how many other people
are they likely to infect?

04:27.136 --> 04:29.617
- I feel like "Contagion" really
brought that to the next level

04:29.660 --> 04:32.794
and included a scientific aspect

04:32.837 --> 04:36.580
of the storytelling that an
outbreak was really rudimentary.

04:36.624 --> 04:40.410
- "Contagion" is the first movie
that made me aware

04:40.454 --> 04:43.108
of how an epidemic spread.

04:44.980 --> 04:47.591
And Scott Z. Burns' script

04:47.635 --> 04:50.812
and the way it's executed
by Steven Soderbergh,

04:50.855 --> 04:52.944
it's just right on the money.

04:54.816 --> 04:57.949
- "Contagion" begins as a woman,
played by Gwyneth Paltrow,

04:57.993 --> 05:01.301
returns home to Minnesota
after a business trip to China.

05:02.693 --> 05:04.260
She's been infected with

05:04.304 --> 05:05.827
a highly contagious
respiratory virus

05:05.870 --> 05:09.265
that she unknowingly
spreads everywhere she goes.

05:11.572 --> 05:14.139
As the number of deaths
exponentially rise,

05:14.183 --> 05:17.229
it becomes a race against time
to figure out how to stop

05:17.273 --> 05:20.102
the virus before
the human race is decimated.

05:20.145 --> 05:22.017
[horn blaring]

05:22.060 --> 05:23.801
- When I started the project,

05:23.845 --> 05:29.764
my hope was that I could write
a movie that was,

05:29.807 --> 05:34.899
in some ways,
a '70s-era disaster movie

05:34.943 --> 05:38.207
where we had this big,
star-studded cast.

05:38.250 --> 05:41.428
[ticking, explosion]

05:43.908 --> 05:48.913
But what I wanted to do was
sort of Trojan Horse that idea

05:48.957 --> 05:50.567
and fill it with science.

05:50.611 --> 05:52.352
- Somewhere in the world

05:52.395 --> 05:54.484
the wrong pig
met up with the wrong bat.

05:54.528 --> 05:55.920
- Have you ever seen anything
like this before?

05:55.964 --> 05:57.879
- No.

05:57.922 --> 05:59.837
- One of the great things about
the all-star cast

05:59.881 --> 06:01.796
is that it made it really

06:01.839 --> 06:05.974
easy for an audience to track
the overlapping stories.

06:06.017 --> 06:08.672
You knew when you were with
Marion Cotillard,

06:08.716 --> 06:11.414
you were in the World
Health Organization story.

06:11.458 --> 06:13.808
You knew that when you were with
Kate Winslet,

06:13.851 --> 06:18.421
you were in the CDC epidemiology
domestic policy story.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.467
You knew that Laurence Fishburne

06:20.510 --> 06:22.469
represented both
the CDC and government

06:22.512 --> 06:24.514
and the intersection
of that, you know,

06:24.558 --> 06:28.039
Matt Damon was all of us.

06:28.083 --> 06:30.955
- Borrowing a page from
Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho"...

06:30.999 --> 06:32.957
- Honey?

06:33.001 --> 06:36.047
- ..."Contagion" throws its
audience off-balance by killing

06:36.091 --> 06:40.051
one of its biggest stars in the
first 10 minutes of the film.

06:40.095 --> 06:41.444
- Let's get a line in her.

06:41.488 --> 06:43.620
- I think one of
the best scenes in the movie,

06:43.664 --> 06:46.014
and it's a brilliant piece
of acting,

06:46.057 --> 06:49.452
but it's, like, incredibly sad
but very plausible,

06:49.496 --> 06:51.628
is when Matt Damon
is in hospital

06:51.672 --> 06:54.457
and is informed of
his wife's death.

06:54.501 --> 06:57.025
- She failed to respond.
- Okay, and?

06:57.068 --> 07:00.985
- Her heart stopped and,
unfortunately, she did die.

07:01.029 --> 07:02.639
- Right.

07:02.683 --> 07:05.076
- And he doesn't hear it,
he can't process it.

07:05.120 --> 07:07.644
- Okay, so can I go
talk to her?

07:07.688 --> 07:11.431
- Mr. Emhoff, I'm sorry,
your wife is dead.

07:14.085 --> 07:16.740
- [coughing]

07:16.784 --> 07:19.917
- There's no doubt that
"Contagion" is a horror film,

07:19.961 --> 07:21.484
but it's so artfully done,

07:21.528 --> 07:23.878
it's so intelligent,
so well-written,

07:23.921 --> 07:27.272
it has such an enormous
star cast that I think people

07:27.316 --> 07:30.798
who dislike horror try to steal
it and say, oh, it's actually

07:30.841 --> 07:32.800
a drama-- it's a horror film.

07:32.843 --> 07:34.845
[saw buzzing]

07:34.889 --> 07:38.022
And the proof is when
they peel off

07:38.066 --> 07:40.590
Gwyneth Paltrow's face,

07:40.634 --> 07:42.897
open up the top her skull
and look inside

07:42.940 --> 07:45.421
and there's nothing
but goop in there.

07:45.465 --> 07:48.293
- My wife makes me take off
my clothes in the garage

07:48.337 --> 07:51.296
and she leaves out a bucket
of warm water and some soap,

07:51.340 --> 07:55.518
and then she douses everything
in hand sanitizer after I leave.

07:55.562 --> 07:57.651
I mean,
she's overreacting, right?

07:57.694 --> 07:59.522
- Not really.

07:59.566 --> 08:04.658
- What I was hoping for was to
get to a place where reality

08:04.701 --> 08:07.487
was scarier than,
than fiction,

08:07.530 --> 08:09.837
and so I was very interested

08:09.880 --> 08:15.495
in what human beings
perceive as dangerous.

08:15.538 --> 08:17.540
- What's that, fomites?

08:17.584 --> 08:19.586
- It refers to
transmission from surfaces.

08:19.629 --> 08:22.458
- As opposed to what really is.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.851
- The average person
touches their face

08:23.894 --> 08:25.766
two or three
thousand times a day.

08:25.809 --> 08:28.551
- Two or three thousand times
a day?

08:28.595 --> 08:30.553
- Three to five times
every waking minute.

08:30.597 --> 08:33.948
- It turns out it tends
to be our, our, our habits

08:33.991 --> 08:39.083
and our lack of willpower
that is probably

08:39.127 --> 08:41.651
a greater existential threat.

08:41.695 --> 08:43.261
- What's your temperature?

08:43.305 --> 08:45.002
- 101.8.

08:45.046 --> 08:47.570
- Steven Soderbergh
peoples the film with, like,

08:47.614 --> 08:49.224
very famous actors and says,

08:49.267 --> 08:51.922
dead, alive, dead, alive,
dead, alive, dead, alive.

08:51.966 --> 08:53.533
- I'm sorry I couldn't finish.

08:53.576 --> 08:54.882
- Just because
Kate Winslet's a big name

08:54.925 --> 08:56.927
doesn't mean
she's gonna make it.

08:56.971 --> 08:59.800
It's a brilliant way to look
at it because you kind of think,

08:59.843 --> 09:02.063
I'm gonna be okay,
my family's gonna be okay--

09:02.106 --> 09:04.152
oh, wait, my brother's dead?

09:04.195 --> 09:06.850
How is that possible?
How can I be immune and him not?

09:08.765 --> 09:10.898
- If the film seems prophetic,

09:10.941 --> 09:14.162
it's because writer Scott Burns
consulted with virologists

09:14.205 --> 09:18.035
and public policy makers
to work out how a novel pathogen

09:18.079 --> 09:19.907
could come into the world,

09:19.950 --> 09:23.040
and what would happen
if it did.

09:23.084 --> 09:26.261
- It was so prophetic,
it was so dead-on,

09:26.304 --> 09:28.698
it didn't miss a single trick.

09:28.742 --> 09:33.747
Everything that it imagined
happening happened,

09:33.790 --> 09:36.967
with only a few tiny exceptions.

09:37.011 --> 09:40.144
- Right now, our best defense
has been social distancing--

09:40.188 --> 09:42.756
no hand shaking,
staying home when you're sick,

09:42.799 --> 09:46.063
washing your hands frequently.

09:46.107 --> 09:50.024
- It anticipated a lot of
the crazy conspiracy theories--

09:50.067 --> 09:54.332
you've got Jude Law
selling Forsythia to suckers.

09:54.376 --> 09:56.117
- What does Forsythia do?

09:56.160 --> 09:58.032
- It's the cure.

09:58.075 --> 10:01.383
[dramatic music]

10:01.426 --> 10:03.254
- It think it's a really
brilliant film,

10:03.298 --> 10:07.084
I'm not surprised that a lot of
people watched it, like,

10:07.128 --> 10:10.697
either for the first time or,
like me, a second time around,

10:10.740 --> 10:15.266
slack-jawed with horror, like,
oh, [bleep], here we go.

10:19.531 --> 10:21.708
- When did we run out of
body bags?

10:21.751 --> 10:24.145
- Two days ago.

10:24.188 --> 10:26.495
[dramatic music]

10:26.538 --> 10:27.888
- "Contagion"
showed us humanity

10:27.931 --> 10:29.890
at the brink of
a viral apocalypse.

10:31.935 --> 10:35.243
What if we went over the edge,
and into the void?

10:37.985 --> 10:40.117
[dramatic music]

10:40.161 --> 10:42.032
- You've gotta think I'm
addicted, haven't you, Cole?

10:42.076 --> 10:44.469
To that dying world?

10:44.513 --> 10:46.210
- I just wanna do my part,

10:46.254 --> 10:49.387
to get us back on top,
in charge of the planet.

10:49.431 --> 10:53.000
- In 1995, a romance
about a weaponized virus

10:53.043 --> 10:56.046
wiping out humanity
came to the screen...

10:56.090 --> 10:59.571
- Five billion people died
in 1996 and 1997.

10:59.615 --> 11:01.748
- ...Terry Gilliam's
"12 Monkeys."

11:01.791 --> 11:03.532
- Are you going to save us,
Mr. Cole?

11:03.575 --> 11:04.968
- I can't save you--
nobody can.

11:07.667 --> 11:11.845
- "12 Monkeys" is based on
"La JetÃ©e," by Chris Marker,

11:11.888 --> 11:16.153
who was a French filmmaker, and
he took a really unique concept

11:16.197 --> 11:20.941
of using stills--
still images-- to convey the arc

11:20.984 --> 11:26.424
of a love story and a man's
witnessing his own death.

11:26.468 --> 11:29.471
[dramatic music and clicking]

11:32.474 --> 11:34.737
And "12 Monkeys"
took that story

11:34.781 --> 11:37.000
and made a feature film
from it.

11:37.044 --> 11:40.264
[dramatic music,
indistinct voice on PA]

11:40.308 --> 11:42.092
- Bruce Willis plays James Cole,

11:42.136 --> 11:44.921
a convict
in the virus-wrecked future.

11:44.965 --> 11:48.055
- James Cole,
cleared from quarantine.

11:48.098 --> 11:49.752
- Cole is sent back in time

11:49.796 --> 11:51.711
to find the source of
the contagion.

11:55.149 --> 11:56.541
[beep]

11:56.585 --> 11:58.282
But he winds up
in a mental institution,

11:58.326 --> 12:00.545
where he meets psychiatrist
Kathryn Railly,

12:00.589 --> 12:02.722
played by Madeleine Stowe.

12:02.765 --> 12:03.810
- What year is this?

12:03.853 --> 12:05.942
- What year do you think it is?

12:05.986 --> 12:08.031
- 1996.

12:08.075 --> 12:09.772
- That's the future, James.

12:09.816 --> 12:11.992
Do you think you're living
in the future?

12:13.515 --> 12:16.648
I was very familiar with Terry
and his sense of displacement

12:16.692 --> 12:19.260
and disorientation
that permeated his movies,

12:19.303 --> 12:21.001
and I was dying to work
with him.

12:22.306 --> 12:24.656
There were some
challenging days,

12:24.700 --> 12:26.223
and part of the challenge,
quite frankly,

12:26.267 --> 12:29.009
was he was dealing with
a movie star in Bruce...

12:29.052 --> 12:31.620
- This is it, James,
what you've been working for.

12:31.663 --> 12:33.709
- Women will want to
get to know you.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.016
- I don't want your women!
I want to get well!

12:36.059 --> 12:38.932
- In the end, he became
very surprised with what Bruce

12:38.975 --> 12:42.283
was doing, which was this
wonderful sort of pure,

12:42.326 --> 12:44.938
childlike thing.

12:44.981 --> 12:48.028
- People can't travel back
in time, "Whoop! Whoop!"

12:48.071 --> 12:50.247
Uh-uh. Not here.

12:50.291 --> 12:53.729
He was just very pure, and
that's perfect for the movie

12:53.773 --> 12:57.385
because it's actually told from
a child's point of view.

12:57.428 --> 12:59.866
[whirring]

12:59.909 --> 13:02.259
- The scenes set in the past
were shot on location

13:02.303 --> 13:06.220
in Philadelphia, which helps to
give the film its unique look.

13:10.746 --> 13:12.748
- It was not a great time
for cities period,

13:12.792 --> 13:15.359
but Philadelphia,
it was really rough.

13:15.403 --> 13:17.361
He went to corners of the city

13:17.405 --> 13:19.886
that filmmakers
were not going to.

13:19.929 --> 13:23.367
You know, for him it was just,
you know, as an artist,

13:23.411 --> 13:25.456
a great palette for him.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.894
- Maybe the human race
deserves to be wiped out.

13:29.156 --> 13:31.636
- Wiping out the human race?

13:31.680 --> 13:33.987
That's a great idea.

13:34.030 --> 13:36.990
- In his first Academy
Award-nominated performance,

13:37.033 --> 13:39.514
Brad Pitt plays a mental patient

13:39.557 --> 13:41.690
with mysterious ties
to the pandemic.

13:41.733 --> 13:43.953
- Jeffrey?
- Mm-hmm.

13:43.997 --> 13:45.999
- You're completely insane.

13:46.042 --> 13:49.176
- He seems to be the engineer
of the apocalypse...

13:49.219 --> 13:51.482
- No, I'm not.

13:51.526 --> 13:53.441
- ...but that's
deliberate misdirection.

13:53.484 --> 13:55.573
The real threat
is a rogue scientist

13:55.617 --> 13:57.662
played by David Morse.

14:00.535 --> 14:03.930
He plans to release a highly
infectious airborne pathogen

14:03.973 --> 14:06.367
across the world.

14:06.410 --> 14:08.804
- He was talking to me about

14:08.848 --> 14:11.763
that scene, you know,
in the airport in "12 Monkeys."

14:11.807 --> 14:13.069
- Do you mind
letting me have a look

14:13.113 --> 14:13.765
at the contents
of your bag, please?

14:13.809 --> 14:15.245
- Please.

14:15.289 --> 14:17.987
Probably my favorite part
of it was the moment

14:18.031 --> 14:21.861
going through security and
didn't want to open the vial,

14:21.904 --> 14:23.427
I guess, or the bottle.

14:23.471 --> 14:27.736
It doesn't... even...
have an odor.

14:27.779 --> 14:29.738
- That's not necessary, sir.

14:29.781 --> 14:32.480
- And just the realization
of what's going to happen

14:32.523 --> 14:34.917
if they do that.

14:34.961 --> 14:38.616
- Cole tries to stop him
and change history.

14:38.660 --> 14:40.053
- No...!

14:40.096 --> 14:42.490
- But the past can't be changed.

14:42.533 --> 14:43.708
[gunshot echoing]

14:50.367 --> 14:53.457
- The story of the film
is that time is a circle,

14:53.501 --> 14:57.548
and that things fold in
on themself and then

14:57.592 --> 15:02.075
Bruce Willis' character is
haunted by a traumatic event

15:02.118 --> 15:04.947
that he witnessed as a child,

15:04.991 --> 15:06.862
and then at the end
of the movie we realize

15:06.906 --> 15:10.083
that the traumatic event was
caused by him as an adult.

15:10.126 --> 15:13.651
[dramatic music]

15:13.695 --> 15:16.132
- It's a very smartly told
narrative because at the center

15:16.176 --> 15:18.526
of it, you think, oh, that's
just the romance and you need

15:18.569 --> 15:22.617
a romance in this type of story,
but really, that's what

15:22.660 --> 15:27.100
the movie is about, is these
two human beings being human

15:27.143 --> 15:31.582
and that is coming to an end
and that's worth saving.

15:34.890 --> 15:36.674
- Without that love story,

15:36.718 --> 15:39.982
how much does Coles'
journey really matter?

15:40.026 --> 15:43.159
How much does the end of the
world really matter? [laughs]

15:43.203 --> 15:46.902
Right, you know, I mean, we're
here for a reason, you know?

15:46.946 --> 15:49.774
I like to think it's to
love each other, so...

15:53.691 --> 15:57.434
- Infections based in reality
are frightening.

15:57.478 --> 15:59.306
When you add a touch of
the supernatural,

15:59.349 --> 16:01.786
they can be absolutely
terrifying.

16:04.485 --> 16:06.356
- Who's chasing you?
- My mom.

16:06.400 --> 16:09.011
My dad.

16:09.055 --> 16:11.405
They're trying to kill me.
- Amen.

16:11.448 --> 16:13.842
- Zombie infection films
take our fears of contagion

16:13.885 --> 16:15.844
and give them teeth.

16:15.887 --> 16:17.019
[growling and screaming]

16:24.809 --> 16:27.812
- Two of the most original
and unforgettable twists

16:27.856 --> 16:30.685
on the genre are
"Pontypool," from Canada.

16:30.728 --> 16:32.774
- [retching]

16:32.817 --> 16:36.473
- [screaming]

16:36.517 --> 16:37.822
- ..and "[REC]" from Spain.

16:40.869 --> 16:42.566
- "[REC]" is a masterpiece.

16:42.610 --> 16:45.265
It really was the first
docu-style film

16:45.308 --> 16:47.528
since "Blair Witch"
that I thought was, like,

16:47.571 --> 16:49.095
legitimately terrifying.

16:49.138 --> 16:51.053
- [screaming]

16:51.097 --> 16:53.186
- "[REC]" is all found footage

16:53.229 --> 16:56.276
through the lens
of this journalist

16:56.319 --> 16:58.756
following just a regular,
good, old night at the job

16:58.800 --> 16:59.975
with these firefighters.

17:02.456 --> 17:04.980
Until they get this call
at this building.

17:05.024 --> 17:08.375
But there's a woman that's in
a little bit of trouble--

17:08.418 --> 17:11.117
maybe she's sick--
and the moment

17:11.160 --> 17:14.076
that the firefighter team gets
there, to this building,

17:14.120 --> 17:16.383
everybody's already in panic.

17:16.426 --> 17:18.167
- [screams]

17:20.256 --> 17:22.432
- And then suddenly,
once the firefighters

17:22.476 --> 17:25.914
and this journalist
go all the way in, man,

17:25.957 --> 17:29.135
that's when all hell breaks
loose, that there's an infection

17:29.178 --> 17:31.050
spreading really fast
in the building.

17:31.093 --> 17:35.271
- [growling and shouting]

17:35.315 --> 17:37.839
[grunting and shouting
in foreign language]

17:43.062 --> 17:45.151
- "[REC]" scared the [bleep]
out of me.

17:45.194 --> 17:49.503
I was just completely shocked,
captivated, appalled,

17:49.546 --> 17:52.506
the moment when they walk
into that apartment and that

17:52.549 --> 17:55.465
old woman in a nightgown comes
running at the camera.

17:55.509 --> 17:59.991
[screaming, gunshots]

18:00.035 --> 18:02.124
It was just so shocking,
and we'd seen

18:02.168 --> 18:05.214
a lot of found footage films
up to this point,

18:05.258 --> 18:07.216
but this did
something different with it.

18:07.260 --> 18:09.088
- [speaking Spanish]

18:16.007 --> 18:19.054
- It had looked like we were
following real people.

18:19.098 --> 18:23.189
No known actors or added score
or anything like that,

18:23.232 --> 18:27.410
it was all use of diegetic
sounds, all of it.

18:27.454 --> 18:29.760
[banging and screaming]

18:32.589 --> 18:35.070
It's an incredible use of what's
actually on the frame

18:35.114 --> 18:38.508
and enhancing those sounds--
the echo in the building,

18:38.552 --> 18:42.556
when you hear at the top story,
"Whaaaap."

18:42.599 --> 18:46.168
[thud, screaming]

18:46.212 --> 18:49.302
And a firefighter
had just got thrown

18:49.345 --> 18:51.869
off the top floor,
all the way down.

18:51.913 --> 18:54.045
That echo and that use of
sound design

18:54.089 --> 18:56.613
really makes an audience
feel like we're there.

18:58.833 --> 19:01.792
[man speaking Spanish on PA]

19:04.099 --> 19:06.101
- Found footage
became part of the horror,

19:06.145 --> 19:10.061
it became part of really
using the camera

19:10.105 --> 19:11.802
to show the isolation.

19:11.846 --> 19:14.457
It uses it so well in the final
scene where we're hurting

19:14.501 --> 19:18.461
for light, and so then we get
this limited view where she goes

19:18.505 --> 19:22.639
into night vision and we are
experiencing the exact same

19:22.683 --> 19:25.251
limited periphery
that the character is.

19:25.294 --> 19:27.818
[rattling]

19:27.862 --> 19:29.603
- That last scene,

19:29.646 --> 19:32.171
when she's in that room
and there's something

19:32.214 --> 19:34.477
in there with her and you
realize this is patient zero.

19:40.309 --> 19:42.485
This is the thing
that started it,

19:42.529 --> 19:45.271
whatever experiment led to
this person being infected,

19:45.314 --> 19:47.577
that they've had it longer
than anyone

19:47.621 --> 19:49.492
and that's what's
spreading it to everybody.

19:52.843 --> 19:55.933
And it's just the scariest,
most awful looking thing,

19:55.977 --> 19:57.587
it's just everyone's
worst nightmare.

20:00.503 --> 20:03.289
- "[REC]" may be the most
terrifying zombie infection film

20:03.332 --> 20:04.812
of recent times...

20:04.855 --> 20:07.771
- [screaming]

20:10.513 --> 20:13.734
- ...but "Pontypool"
is the most unusual.

20:13.777 --> 20:17.128
- Grant, Grant, Grant...

20:19.392 --> 20:21.916
- Stephen McHattie
plays a talk radio personality

20:21.959 --> 20:24.223
in a small Canadian town...

20:24.266 --> 20:26.094
- Pontypool, good morning.

20:26.137 --> 20:27.530
You know, I want to talk to you
about something

20:27.574 --> 20:30.925
that has been buggin' me.

20:30.968 --> 20:33.797
- ...who slowly begins to
realize he's broadcasting

20:33.841 --> 20:37.236
from the epicenter
of a rage zombie outbreak.

20:37.279 --> 20:40.804
[static and man screaming]

20:40.848 --> 20:43.154
- Pontypool's under quarantine.

20:43.198 --> 20:45.766
Everybody has to stay inside
at all times.

20:45.809 --> 20:48.464
- "Pontypool" is a really
fascinating and different

20:48.508 --> 20:52.338
kind of infection
because it's not airborne,

20:52.381 --> 20:54.992
there's no real way of
understanding the transmission

20:55.036 --> 20:58.082
because it's just through
the spoken language.

20:58.126 --> 21:00.737
- I'm going to go see
if Mr. Mazzy's missing...

21:00.781 --> 21:06.003
[indistinct echoing]
...missing, missing.

21:06.047 --> 21:08.092
- Where you say a word and then
they keep saying that word

21:08.136 --> 21:09.442
over and over and over again
and then it starts spreading

21:09.485 --> 21:10.921
from person to person.

21:10.965 --> 21:15.404
- Prah, prah,
prah, prah, prah...

21:17.363 --> 21:19.669
- You say something, you're
unknowingly infecting them

21:19.713 --> 21:22.455
with this virus
that's making them insane.

21:22.498 --> 21:25.371
[shouting and banging]

21:29.375 --> 21:31.812
- It is the ultimate
low-budget movie

21:31.855 --> 21:34.554
in that you never leave
this radio studio.

21:34.597 --> 21:36.947
And there's a massive infection

21:36.991 --> 21:39.776
taking place outside the studio,
in the real world,

21:39.820 --> 21:42.605
and other than
a handful of the infected,

21:42.649 --> 21:44.651
you never really see them.

21:44.694 --> 21:46.914
It's a movie as a radio play.

21:46.957 --> 21:50.352
- People need to know,
we have to get this out.

21:50.396 --> 21:52.572
- Well, it's your call,
Mr. Mazzy.

21:52.615 --> 21:54.661
Let's just hope
what you're getting out there

21:54.704 --> 21:58.578
isn't going to destroy
your world.

21:58.621 --> 22:00.057
- When it came out
it seemed something very alien,

22:00.101 --> 22:01.537
like how can a word
or a phrase be something

22:01.581 --> 22:03.452
that could actually hurt you?

22:03.496 --> 22:06.368
And now social media, of course,
has come such a long way since

22:06.412 --> 22:08.239
that movie came out,
it's all about words,

22:08.283 --> 22:09.893
it's so violent right now
that if you just say

22:09.937 --> 22:12.287
the wrong thing to someone,
like, boom,

22:12.331 --> 22:13.636
you know, all you do
is say one sentence and suddenly

22:13.680 --> 22:16.291
you've got people rioting
in the capitol building.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.162
So that's, I think "Pontypool,"
in that way,

22:18.206 --> 22:19.903
is very ahead of its time.

22:19.947 --> 22:21.818
- I am trying
to piss a few people off

22:21.862 --> 22:25.126
because that's how it's done,
simple as that.

22:26.562 --> 22:29.391
- Infections take many forms--

22:29.435 --> 22:32.089
none more unnerving
than the sexual parasites

22:32.133 --> 22:35.354
infesting the early films
of David Cronenberg.

22:38.052 --> 22:43.231
[eerie music]

22:43.274 --> 22:45.625
- Of all the infections
human beings can endure...

22:45.668 --> 22:48.279
- [screaming]

22:48.323 --> 22:50.064
- ...sexually
transmitted diseases

22:50.107 --> 22:52.022
induce the most squirms.

22:53.981 --> 22:57.332
One trailblazing filmmaker,
David Cronenberg,

22:57.376 --> 23:00.335
brought venereal horror
to the screen.

23:02.685 --> 23:04.774
At the beginning
of his long career

23:04.818 --> 23:09.126
he made two influential films
that traumatized a generation.

23:09.170 --> 23:11.607
The first was "Shivers."

23:11.651 --> 23:12.695
- Ew!

23:16.395 --> 23:18.397
[screaming]

23:25.839 --> 23:28.189
- "Shivers"--
initially released in America

23:28.232 --> 23:31.279
as "They Came From Within"--
chronicles the spread

23:31.322 --> 23:33.716
of genetically engineered
parasites

23:33.760 --> 23:36.327
inside a high-rise
apartment building.

23:36.371 --> 23:38.895
- Ooh!
- Oh!

23:38.939 --> 23:40.419
- Ooh, good heavens.

23:42.377 --> 23:44.901
- The parasites turn
mild-mannered Canadians

23:44.945 --> 23:47.121
into crazed sex fiends.

23:47.164 --> 23:49.384
- I'm hungry for love!

23:51.517 --> 23:53.562
- A combination of aphrodisiac

23:53.606 --> 23:56.435
and venereal disease, it will
hopefully turn the world

23:56.478 --> 23:59.089
into one beautiful,
mindless orgy.

24:01.918 --> 24:05.052
- Well, I think it sounds
a little crazy to me.

24:05.095 --> 24:09.186
- Roger, I had a very disturbing
dream last night.

24:09.230 --> 24:14.409
In this dream, I found myself
making love to a strange man.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.803
- "Shivers"
or "They Came From Within"

24:16.846 --> 24:20.459
is one of the absolute perfect
films from David Cronenberg,

24:20.502 --> 24:22.635
and it's one of his first.

24:22.678 --> 24:24.375
- [hissing]

24:26.552 --> 24:29.119
- It's psychosexual,
it's twisted,

24:29.163 --> 24:31.861
it brings in all of these
elements of body horror,

24:31.905 --> 24:35.430
and it is beautifully
post-1960s.

24:35.474 --> 24:39.521
[all shouting]

24:39.565 --> 24:42.263
- That was a plague film
of its time

24:42.306 --> 24:44.308
because that was
the sexual revolution,

24:44.352 --> 24:46.963
that was when Baby Boomers were
suddenly waking up to the idea

24:47.007 --> 24:50.401
that you can boink someone
that you weren't married to.

24:53.013 --> 24:55.668
And that was a very big deal
to that generation,

24:55.711 --> 24:59.759
so you had to have a plague that
could make you do something

24:59.802 --> 25:02.326
as crazy as have sex
out of wedlock.

25:07.723 --> 25:11.510
[all moaning]

25:13.599 --> 25:16.689
- It culminates
in this completely abhorrent

25:16.732 --> 25:19.779
orgy pool scene.

25:19.822 --> 25:22.521
Somehow even though
you don't really see much,

25:22.564 --> 25:25.001
it feels like you are
seeing everything.

25:28.178 --> 25:31.138
- I think the end of "Shivers"
is really terrifying,

25:31.181 --> 25:33.270
when they had that slow motion
shot of them in the pool

25:33.314 --> 25:35.577
and her kissing him--

25:35.621 --> 25:38.319
the music and everything--
really disturbing.

25:38.362 --> 25:41.365
[eerie music]

25:41.409 --> 25:42.976
- Are these people victims?

25:43.019 --> 25:44.934
Or have they been liberated
from the straightjacket

25:44.978 --> 25:48.024
of their lonely
middle-class lives?

25:48.068 --> 25:50.940
Cronenberg's subversive mission
is to make us question

25:50.984 --> 25:53.682
our assumptions
about our true natures.

25:57.817 --> 25:59.296
His next film, "Rabid,"

25:59.340 --> 26:02.212
was a kind of sequel
to "Shivers."

26:02.256 --> 26:04.475
Instead of confining the action
to one building,

26:04.519 --> 26:06.739
he follows the spread
of a nasty new form

26:06.782 --> 26:08.697
of rabies across Quebec.

26:08.741 --> 26:11.221
[gunshots]

26:14.485 --> 26:16.226
The source of the contagion
is Rose,

26:16.270 --> 26:19.012
played by Marilyn Chambers.

26:19.055 --> 26:23.277
After an accident, Rose receives
experimental skin grafts

26:23.320 --> 26:25.366
from a pioneering
plastic surgeon.

26:25.409 --> 26:26.715
- [screaming]

26:28.761 --> 26:30.327
- All right,
you hold it right there.

26:30.371 --> 26:32.634
- The procedure
restores her body,

26:32.678 --> 26:35.158
but gives her
a little something extra--

26:35.202 --> 26:37.857
a blood-sucking stinger
under her armpit.

26:37.900 --> 26:39.032
- [screaming]

26:45.473 --> 26:48.955
- Anyone she feeds on will
become a bloodthirsty cannibal.

26:48.998 --> 26:50.739
- [roaring]

26:53.394 --> 26:54.830
- I remember watching it
and like, oh,

26:54.874 --> 26:56.266
this is pretty good,
going along with it.

26:58.791 --> 27:00.793
Like, wow, this is getting
a little rougher

27:00.836 --> 27:02.098
than I was expecting.

27:03.709 --> 27:06.581
But when
the operation scene happens

27:06.625 --> 27:09.671
and the doctor takes
the nurse's finger

27:09.715 --> 27:13.414
and cuts it off
with the scissors.

27:13.457 --> 27:15.590
- [screaming]

27:18.724 --> 27:20.726
- Oh, my God!
What am I watching?

27:23.642 --> 27:25.644
- In "Rabid,"
what was scary about it

27:25.687 --> 27:28.821
was to see how quickly
infections spread.

27:28.864 --> 27:31.258
[shouting and screaming]

27:36.916 --> 27:39.266
Even if you set off
a nuke on a city,

27:39.309 --> 27:41.703
if you live outside the city,
you're gonna be okay.

27:41.747 --> 27:45.707
But imagine setting off a nuke
that then makes more nukes.

27:45.751 --> 27:48.797
- I'm in terrible trouble,
you gotta help me.

27:48.841 --> 27:53.149
- Marilyn Chambers didn't even
know that she was Typhoid Mary

27:53.193 --> 27:55.717
until it was too late--

27:55.761 --> 27:58.807
that's what's so scary about
being a spreader-- you don't

27:58.851 --> 28:03.072
even know you're a spreader
until you've already spread.

28:03.116 --> 28:04.639
[indistinct screaming on phone]

28:04.683 --> 28:06.206
- I'm afraid!

28:06.249 --> 28:08.077
- As the pandemic rages,

28:08.121 --> 28:09.949
Rose falls victim
to one of the infected.

28:14.736 --> 28:17.521
She becomes just another corpse
to be disposed of.

28:20.655 --> 28:24.441
Plagues have ravaged mankind
for centuries.

28:24.485 --> 28:25.921
- Pull!

28:25.965 --> 28:27.575
- But there have always been
those who think

28:27.618 --> 28:29.533
it could never happen to them.

28:32.580 --> 28:35.148
[clanging]

28:35.191 --> 28:39.326
- In the early 1960s,
director/producer Roger Corman

28:39.369 --> 28:41.763
made the jump from low-budget
black-and-white films

28:41.807 --> 28:44.505
to the slightly-bigger-budgeted
color films

28:44.548 --> 28:46.681
based on the gothic horror
of Edgar Allan Poe.

28:49.075 --> 28:50.685
To help sell the pictures,

28:50.729 --> 28:54.341
Corman brought in
veteran actor Vincent Price.

28:54.384 --> 28:56.735
- [screaming]

28:56.778 --> 28:59.868
- The Poe films made Price
a horror icon.

29:01.827 --> 29:05.134
- Vincent Price
was wonderful to work with--

29:05.178 --> 29:08.964
he was a highly intelligent,
educated man,

29:09.008 --> 29:11.793
he'd graduated from Yale.

29:11.837 --> 29:14.056
[dramatic music]

29:14.100 --> 29:16.755
- The razor edge of death.

29:16.798 --> 29:20.628
Thus the condition of man.

29:20.671 --> 29:25.154
Bound on an island from which
he can never hope to escape.

29:25.198 --> 29:29.115
- So he came with
great intelligence

29:29.158 --> 29:33.075
and a classical training
as an actor.

29:36.687 --> 29:38.385
- What is the meaning of this?

29:38.428 --> 29:41.127
- Probably the very first
of the films,

29:41.170 --> 29:43.825
"The Fall of
the House of Usher."

29:43.869 --> 29:46.088
- How dare you admit anyone
into this house?

29:46.132 --> 29:49.178
- I think it was one of
his best performances.

29:49.222 --> 29:51.224
- Be done!
[thunder crashes]

29:51.267 --> 29:53.966
- That and the first film
we shot in England,

29:54.009 --> 29:56.185
which was
"Masque of the Red Death."

29:56.229 --> 29:59.493
- The village is full of
the Red Death.

29:59.536 --> 30:01.843
- The Red Death?

30:01.887 --> 30:05.238
Prince Prospero,
I beg you, allow us haven!

30:05.281 --> 30:06.805
I beg sanctuary!

30:06.848 --> 30:08.807
- This is no church.

30:10.156 --> 30:11.592
- "The Masque of the Red Death"
is, you know,

30:11.635 --> 30:15.422
a terrific movie, I think,
it seems to be the pinnacle

30:15.465 --> 30:18.425
of the Edgar Allan Poe series
that Roger Corman did

30:18.468 --> 30:22.733
because he was in England
and he had access to more time

30:22.777 --> 30:24.735
and a bit more money.

30:24.779 --> 30:27.303
- He'd been very influenced,
shall we say,

30:27.347 --> 30:29.044
by "The Seventh Seal," which was
a huge art house hit at the time

30:29.088 --> 30:30.785
which, you know,
Ingmar Bergman film,

30:30.829 --> 30:32.178
where you had Death
in a black cloak.

30:32.221 --> 30:34.963
[both speaking foreign language]

30:38.532 --> 30:41.535
- Very symbolic, all about
the Plague, you know,

30:41.578 --> 30:43.406
during the medieval era.

30:43.450 --> 30:45.800
And so he kind of found a way
to filter that

30:45.844 --> 30:49.108
into the Edgar Allan Poe story.

30:49.151 --> 30:50.326
- [screaming]

30:53.329 --> 30:56.376
- Prince Prospero, who's this
very cruel nobleman who invites

30:56.419 --> 30:58.552
his friends up to his castle
because there's the Red Death,

30:58.595 --> 31:00.815
this plague that's ravaging the
countryside and so they figure,

31:00.859 --> 31:03.122
oh, we'll just cloister
ourselves away and party down

31:03.165 --> 31:05.211
and, you know, when it's all
done and the smoke clears

31:05.254 --> 31:07.866
we'll go out
and live our lives.

31:07.909 --> 31:11.695
- But because of me, through
my mediation with my master,

31:11.739 --> 31:14.133
the Lord of Flies,

31:14.176 --> 31:19.051
you-- all of you--
unworthy though you may be,

31:19.094 --> 31:22.141
will be safe from the Red Death.

31:24.186 --> 31:25.666
- He shot in beautiful
Technicolor, and that's one of

31:25.709 --> 31:27.886
the most amazing aspects
of the movie, actually,

31:27.929 --> 31:31.846
the cinematography by Nicolas
Roeg--it's just stunning.

31:31.890 --> 31:34.893
The camera's constantly moving
one way or another.

31:35.981 --> 31:38.026
There's a lot of very wide shots

31:38.070 --> 31:40.550
because those sets
allow a lot of scope.

31:40.594 --> 31:42.161
It's just-- it's stunning,

31:42.204 --> 31:43.902
it's a really,
really beautiful movie.

31:45.816 --> 31:47.557
And then, of course,
there's Vincent Price, who was,

31:47.601 --> 31:51.518
you know, giving 100 percent
as Prince Prospero

31:51.561 --> 31:55.914
and delightfully cruel
and delightfully hate-able.

31:58.394 --> 31:59.700
- You're a madman!

31:59.743 --> 32:02.355
- And yet I will live
and you will die.

32:02.398 --> 32:06.707
- He played a man of evil,
but there were shadings

32:06.750 --> 32:12.495
of tenderness within him towards
a young girl that he had

32:12.539 --> 32:16.325
taken from the plague-stricken
countryside.

32:16.369 --> 32:19.850
- I do not want to hurt you,
my dear.

32:19.894 --> 32:22.070
Can't you understand?

32:22.114 --> 32:24.768
I want to help save your soul
so you can join me

32:24.812 --> 32:26.118
in the glories of Hell.

32:26.161 --> 32:27.771
- No! Never!

32:30.296 --> 32:33.429
- While the outside world is
ravaged by a plague of the body,

32:33.473 --> 32:37.999
Prospero's castle is infected
by a plague of the spirit.

32:38.043 --> 32:40.741
- Demon lover,
of all those

32:40.784 --> 32:44.440
who wish to live
in your eternal light,

32:44.484 --> 32:46.442
transcribe the final mark.

32:46.486 --> 32:48.967
- This infection isn't
inflicted on its victims--

32:49.010 --> 32:50.925
it's chosen by them.

32:56.452 --> 32:59.151
The orgy of corruption,
cruelty, and depravity

32:59.194 --> 33:02.284
reaches its zenith at
Prospero's masquerade ball,

33:02.328 --> 33:06.201
where everything is permitted,
except wearing the color red.

33:10.597 --> 33:12.338
- The one percent
locks themselves up

33:12.381 --> 33:15.036
in the castle and parties,
thinking that, you know,

33:15.080 --> 33:17.734
they're never gonna let
anybody infected in.

33:17.778 --> 33:20.085
And then, of course,
the Grim Reaper gets in.

33:23.262 --> 33:26.787
There's no escape,
is what I got out of that.

33:28.310 --> 33:30.921
- I would like to see
your face.

33:32.053 --> 33:35.056
- There is no face of death

33:35.100 --> 33:38.842
until the moment
of your own death.

33:40.583 --> 33:43.325
- Death is the great leveler.

33:43.369 --> 33:46.241
You can be famous, you can
be rich, you could be powerful--

33:46.285 --> 33:48.678
but one thing you're not
going to escape,

33:48.722 --> 33:52.421
and it's an experience
that's common to everybody

33:52.465 --> 33:55.033
who has ever lived
and who ever will live.

33:55.076 --> 33:57.296
- Let me see your face.

33:57.339 --> 34:00.081
[thunder crashes]

34:00.125 --> 34:03.084
- Your hell,
Prince Prospero,

34:03.128 --> 34:06.087
and the moment of your death.

34:06.131 --> 34:08.742
- It's the one common
nod of humanity.

34:08.785 --> 34:13.355
[dramatic music]

34:13.399 --> 34:18.186
- The human race is barely able
to cope with disease on Earth.

34:18.230 --> 34:21.494
Would we stand a chance against
something not of this Earth?

34:25.193 --> 34:27.456
[eerie music]

34:27.500 --> 34:29.241
- When you think of
alien invaders,

34:29.284 --> 34:31.025
you might think of this.

34:31.069 --> 34:32.505
[laser zapping]

34:38.293 --> 34:40.382
[dramatic music]

34:40.426 --> 34:43.168
But what if the invader
was a virus from space,

34:43.211 --> 34:45.909
something we have
no immunity against?

34:48.173 --> 34:50.740
That's the premise
of "The Andromeda Strain."

34:52.351 --> 34:54.353
Based on the novel
by Michael Crichton,

34:54.396 --> 34:57.573
it's the story of a space probe
that crash lands

34:57.617 --> 35:00.968
in a small town, bringing back
a pathogen that rapidly kills

35:01.011 --> 35:04.798
99.9 percent
of the population,

35:04.841 --> 35:07.148
turning their blood to dust.

35:07.192 --> 35:08.889
- Powder.

35:08.932 --> 35:12.066
- I'll be damned.

35:12.110 --> 35:15.069
- Now an elite team of
scientists must find a cure

35:15.113 --> 35:18.507
before the alien virus
spreads across the Earth.

35:18.551 --> 35:20.335
- Never believed this could
really happen.

35:20.379 --> 35:22.207
- Well, it has happened.

35:22.250 --> 35:26.080
- The classic of that genre,
I think, the Big Mamou,

35:26.124 --> 35:28.082
the one that everyone--
they're all judged by

35:28.126 --> 35:29.475
is probably
"The Andromeda Strain."

35:29.518 --> 35:31.955
- Uh, yeah, yes.

35:31.999 --> 35:33.740
- If you're not talking about
just some weird zombie breakout

35:33.783 --> 35:37.439
happening-- you're talking
about, like, oh, a genuine

35:37.483 --> 35:41.226
disease that it could happen and
you're trying to clamp it down,

35:41.269 --> 35:44.011
that's the one that they all get
judged by, I think.

35:44.054 --> 35:45.230
- I mean,
I love "The Androm--"

35:45.273 --> 35:47.145
What do you think--
what is it about?

35:47.188 --> 35:49.103
It's such a simple movie and
it's so well done, and it just,

35:49.147 --> 35:51.845
it's just the pace of that movie
just moves and moves.

35:51.888 --> 35:55.414
[dramatic music]

35:55.457 --> 35:59.635
- I fell in love with, with just
the notion of, you know,

35:59.679 --> 36:02.725
the scene where they're,
like, examining the ship.

36:02.769 --> 36:04.597
- What about the bits of green?

36:04.640 --> 36:06.468
- And then you just see
the one little green speck

36:06.512 --> 36:11.517
and you're like, wait, that one
little tiny speck of dust

36:11.560 --> 36:13.475
caused all of this.

36:15.782 --> 36:17.523
[softly]
- It's growing.

36:17.566 --> 36:20.526
[dramatic music]

36:20.569 --> 36:23.529
- Perhaps the strangest
infection ever put on film

36:23.572 --> 36:27.663
is the 2020 adaptation
of the H.P. Lovecraft story,

36:27.707 --> 36:29.187
"The Color Out of Space".

36:31.189 --> 36:33.930
Nicolas Cage plays the patriarch
of an eccentric family

36:33.974 --> 36:36.890
living in an
isolated country house.

36:36.933 --> 36:39.936
[explosion, screaming]

36:39.980 --> 36:42.983
One night a meteorite
crashes into their yard,

36:43.026 --> 36:46.247
bringing with it
an unearthly infection.

36:46.291 --> 36:49.294
Teenaged daughter Lavinia is
the only member of the family

36:49.337 --> 36:53.472
who quickly realizes the
meteorite is not what it seems.

36:53.515 --> 36:58.128
- It's behind the lightning.
[thunder crashing]

36:58.172 --> 37:00.348
- At first it's fascinating
because it's this

37:00.392 --> 37:03.395
beautiful thing-- there's that
dichotomy of it being this

37:03.438 --> 37:07.529
gorgeous meteorite that lands
in their front yard and it's

37:07.573 --> 37:11.751
kind of this amazing thing
that's otherworldly.

37:11.794 --> 37:15.015
[eerie music]

37:15.058 --> 37:17.626
And then gradually
you see that this is

37:17.670 --> 37:19.976
a very malevolent entity.

37:23.066 --> 37:25.112
- Whatever was in the meteorite
infects the land

37:25.155 --> 37:28.158
and transforms the family--

37:28.202 --> 37:32.554
first, their minds...
then, their bodies.

37:34.556 --> 37:37.037
- It's like a virus-- you can't
see it, you don't know

37:37.080 --> 37:39.605
where it is or when it's present
or how dangerous it is

37:39.648 --> 37:41.302
or when it might strike.

37:41.346 --> 37:43.304
But you have to be on guard
all of the time.

37:43.348 --> 37:44.914
- Look out!
[screaming]

37:44.958 --> 37:47.177
- The worse things get,

37:47.221 --> 37:49.571
the deeper the father
sinks into denial.

37:49.615 --> 37:51.573
- Come on, dad, don't pretend
that you haven't noticed.

37:51.617 --> 37:54.620
- Nothing has been [bleep]
this place up.

37:54.663 --> 37:56.535
- Why are you so in denial?

37:56.578 --> 37:59.712
- Okay, you know,
I've had it with your drama!

37:59.755 --> 38:03.281
- The picture features
a classically

38:03.324 --> 38:06.632
unhinged performance
by Nic Cage.

38:06.675 --> 38:11.289
- [shouting]

38:13.508 --> 38:15.031
- His performance is a stunner,

38:15.075 --> 38:18.600
but in and around that
performance is a story

38:18.644 --> 38:21.342
about a family's
shared sense of reality

38:21.386 --> 38:26.129
being smashed into tinier
and tinier fragments

38:26.173 --> 38:27.696
by an environmental poison

38:27.740 --> 38:29.872
that has leaked into
their well water.

38:31.831 --> 38:34.790
- Much of the film is seen from
the point of view of Ward,

38:34.834 --> 38:37.315
a young scientist
who befriends the family.

38:37.358 --> 38:40.143
- Jack, what are you up to?

38:40.187 --> 38:41.971
- Playing with my friends.

38:42.015 --> 38:45.105
- This de facto stand-in for
the infamously racist Lovecraft

38:45.148 --> 38:47.847
is played by a person of color.

38:47.890 --> 38:50.023
- I remember Nic
saying a few times

38:50.066 --> 38:53.200
that he'd always wanted to do
a family drama and, for him,

38:53.243 --> 38:55.028
that's what "Color" was.

38:55.071 --> 38:56.769
- What do you mean you tried?

38:56.812 --> 39:00.381
Do you have any idea how much
those animals cost us?

39:00.425 --> 39:03.602
They are alpacas-- alpacas.

39:03.645 --> 39:05.995
- And so that's how
we entered it and I think

39:06.039 --> 39:09.390
it's exactly that, it was
a dysfunctional family

39:09.434 --> 39:12.785
in very bizarre circumstances,

39:12.828 --> 39:15.831
and that's what really
gave it its kick.

39:15.875 --> 39:17.572
- I can't get a dial tone.

39:17.616 --> 39:20.270
- It becomes body horror,
which is basically

39:20.314 --> 39:23.970
taking something as simple
and intrinsic to our experience

39:24.013 --> 39:27.408
as humans as a mother's embrace
of their own child

39:27.452 --> 39:30.150
and turning that into
something grotesque.

39:30.193 --> 39:32.805
- [screaming]

39:32.848 --> 39:35.155
[eerie music]

39:35.198 --> 39:38.288
- Late in the picture
the llamas out in the garage

39:38.332 --> 39:40.943
all become this one slimy

39:40.987 --> 39:43.250
10-headed grotesque
llama creature.

39:43.293 --> 39:46.035
- [screaming, gunshot]

39:46.079 --> 39:48.908
- The teen girl is slicing

39:48.951 --> 39:52.520
pentagrams
into her flesh.

39:52.564 --> 39:54.653
- The father loses his mind.

39:54.696 --> 39:58.004
- We've been having a hard time,
you know?

39:58.047 --> 40:01.355
- And Lavinia realizes she is
humanity's last line of defense

40:01.399 --> 40:04.053
against the color out of space.

40:04.097 --> 40:06.360
- It's so beautiful.

40:08.667 --> 40:10.451
- It's a progressive spin
on Lovecraft's

40:10.495 --> 40:13.367
relentlessly misanthropic tale.

40:16.022 --> 40:18.546
- Lavinia isn't ruined
by the color, rather,

40:18.590 --> 40:20.243
she's elevated by the color

40:20.287 --> 40:22.463
and she kind of
reaches her true purpose

40:22.507 --> 40:26.380
by willingly
and voluntarily merging

40:26.424 --> 40:28.600
with the color
and sacrificing herself

40:28.643 --> 40:31.559
so that the color returns
to its original source.

40:37.043 --> 40:40.089
- Only Ward survives, slowly
emerging from the wreckage

40:40.133 --> 40:43.049
into a colorless world.

40:43.092 --> 40:46.182
- It came out right before,
you know, Covid...

40:46.226 --> 40:48.533
hit and started impacting
the entire world.

40:51.536 --> 40:53.494
It's absolutely relevant
to today

40:53.538 --> 40:56.323
and I don't know what
the moral of the story is,

40:56.366 --> 40:57.890
because we haven't, you know,

40:57.933 --> 41:00.109
we haven't reached the
conclusion of this one yet.

41:00.153 --> 41:04.505
What touched this place cannot
be quantified or understood

41:04.549 --> 41:06.855
by human science.

41:06.899 --> 41:08.553
And I don't really know
what the moral of the story

41:08.596 --> 41:10.859
of "Color Out of Space"
is, either...

41:10.903 --> 41:14.820
yeah, other than maybe be the
Black guy, for once. [laughs]

41:14.863 --> 41:16.474
I'll take it.

41:16.517 --> 41:20.608
It was just a color
out of space.

41:22.305 --> 41:24.699
[rumbling]

41:24.743 --> 41:26.658
- In the movies,
lethal contagions can come

41:26.701 --> 41:31.053
from outer space,
escape from a lab,

41:31.097 --> 41:33.403
or emerge from the rain forest,

41:33.447 --> 41:35.623
leaving a trail of the dead
in their wake.

41:37.799 --> 41:40.149
But as films
and real life have shown us,

41:40.193 --> 41:42.108
the human race is resilient.

41:42.151 --> 41:43.457
- Boy, I better get vaccinated.

41:45.154 --> 41:48.810
- New threats will come,
but we can survive them...

41:48.854 --> 41:50.029
or can we?

41:50.072 --> 41:51.334
- [screaming]
