00:21.056 --> 00:22.375
I'm really sorry,

00:22.376 --> 00:23.815
I hope you don't mind,

00:23.816 --> 00:25.975
I need someone to talk to
and I thought of you.

00:25.976 --> 00:28.055
- It's about my mum's murder.
- Oh.

00:28.056 --> 00:30.015
I've heard things
that I think could be important,

00:30.016 --> 00:32.255
and someone told me that
she was dismembered

00:32.256 --> 00:33.535
and then I found a photograph

00:33.536 --> 00:38.286
and I think it could have something
to do with her murder.

01:35.696 --> 01:37.695
Now, I've just stopped for a snack.

01:37.696 --> 01:40.655
Well great,

I just... Someone tried to
jump off the bridge.

02:03.736 --> 02:05.095
God, that's terrible.

02:05.096 --> 02:07.655
I know, I know...
We're all going to have to wait.

02:07.656 --> 02:09.490
- Until he jumps?
- Hm.

02:09.576 --> 02:11.535
I can see that it's a water problem

02:11.536 --> 02:13.453
and not a road problem.

02:13.976 --> 02:15.476
Welcome to Dundee.

02:27.296 --> 02:28.416
Hiya.

02:28.536 --> 02:30.575
- Don't put diesel in.
- OK.

02:30.576 --> 02:32.535
- Are you there yet?
- No, nearly.

02:32.536 --> 02:34.095
The house is so quiet without you,

02:34.096 --> 02:35.615
I'm not sure I'll ever
get used to it...

02:35.616 --> 02:38.335
Oh, he must have jumped. We're off.

02:38.336 --> 02:42.670
- I've gotta go, I'll call you later.
- OK, love you.

02:53.176 --> 02:55.655
- A Dundee man
and woman are missing, feared dead,

02:55.656 --> 02:57.895
following a fire in the city
last night.

02:57.896 --> 03:00.095
Police and Fire Services
were called out to

03:00.096 --> 03:03.096
Secrets Nightclub
at half past ten...

03:12.856 --> 03:16.056
Thermal decomposition is the action

03:16.176 --> 03:18.816
of heat on a fuel

03:18.896 --> 03:21.615
to vaporise it and produce a gas.

03:21.616 --> 03:25.135
When this gas mixes with the right
amount of air and is ignited,

03:25.136 --> 03:28.855
then you have flame and combustion,
or visible flame.

03:28.856 --> 03:32.695
The fire then grows and develops,
as more fuels thermally decompose,

03:32.696 --> 03:36.335
until eventually, a process
called flashover happens.

03:36.336 --> 03:39.416
Flashover is when a fire in a room

03:39.576 --> 03:43.695
becomes a room completely on fire,
everything burns, you have a huge

03:43.696 --> 03:47.975
supply of combustible gases and the
fire becomes ventilation controlled.

03:47.976 --> 03:51.560
Controlled by the amount
of air in the room.

03:53.656 --> 03:55.655
The Procurator Fiscal's
on the phone to Kathy,

03:55.656 --> 03:57.335
he'd like you to ring them
as soon as you can.

03:57.336 --> 04:00.415
- I'll bring you a coffee.
- Champion.

04:00.416 --> 04:02.495
Hey, what's the Fiscal saying?

04:02.496 --> 04:05.255
There was a fatal fire in a
nightclub in Larky last night.

04:05.256 --> 04:06.735
I heard it on the news.

04:06.736 --> 04:10.095
Two sudden deaths,
he wants both of us to work on it.

04:10.096 --> 04:12.180
And guess who the SIO is?

04:12.616 --> 04:14.536
- Neil.
- How come?

04:14.736 --> 04:17.135
All the major investigation
teams are tied up in Glasgow.

04:17.136 --> 04:18.303
Good for Neil.

04:21.736 --> 04:23.935
The new lab technician's arriving
sometime between two

04:23.936 --> 04:25.455
and three - Emma Hedges.

04:25.456 --> 04:27.335
Leave it with me,
I'll get her enrolled.

04:27.336 --> 04:28.895
Tell her I'm sorry.

04:28.896 --> 04:31.055
I really wanted to be
there to greet her.

04:31.056 --> 04:32.775
Kathy, we could go together.

04:32.776 --> 04:34.615
I'm not going to the strategy
meeting, I'm going

04:34.616 --> 04:36.535
- straight to the scene.
- Oh, OK, I'll see you there.

04:36.536 --> 04:38.786
Ah, you want to share this?

04:39.056 --> 04:40.136
Yes...

04:43.016 --> 04:45.096
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

04:45.256 --> 04:47.056
Kathy, you have post.

05:11.256 --> 05:14.375
The fire scene is being
photographed this morning.

05:14.376 --> 05:18.335
This wall here, everything behind
it, are staff quarters.

05:18.336 --> 05:19.536
Kitchen.

05:21.616 --> 05:23.615
- Sorry.
- Oh, hello, Sarah.

05:23.616 --> 05:26.895
Professor Sarah Gordon from SIFA,
everyone.

05:26.896 --> 05:28.256
Fire maestro,

05:28.416 --> 05:32.000
but, erm, don't annoy her,
she's a tyrant...

05:34.136 --> 05:37.135
Office - we have human remains here,

05:37.136 --> 05:38.803
partly skeletonised,

05:38.976 --> 05:43.175
so will be attended by a forensic
anthropologist, and a body here,

05:43.176 --> 05:47.535
less badly burned, still fleshed, so
will be attended by a pathologist.

05:47.536 --> 05:49.535
This body's thought to be male,

05:49.536 --> 05:51.455
it's partly covered by debris.

05:51.456 --> 05:54.336
Top priority, identify these two.

05:54.496 --> 05:58.695
Secrets was hired to celebrate the
30th anniversary of a local couple,

05:58.696 --> 06:00.896
Tommy and Jean Rattray.

06:01.056 --> 06:02.975
We have a guest list of 84 people.

06:02.976 --> 06:06.495
As far as we know, everyone on that
list is accounted for.

06:06.496 --> 06:09.295
Two members of staff were not seen
leaving the building

06:09.296 --> 06:10.455
and are still missing...

06:10.456 --> 06:13.576
Shelley Nardoni and Bashir Kumar.

06:15.096 --> 06:17.255
We've applied for their
dental records,

06:17.256 --> 06:20.340
so, we'll see
if these are our bodies.

06:20.776 --> 06:24.775
People became aware of smoke just
after half ten and these fire

06:24.776 --> 06:27.695
doors, as well as the main entrance,

06:27.696 --> 06:30.175
were opened quickly and efficiently.

06:30.176 --> 06:32.495
The manager, Shuggie Brooke,
carried a couple of people out.

06:32.496 --> 06:33.735
What's he saying?

06:33.736 --> 06:37.335
Shuggie Brooke told us that he
was mostly out front.

06:37.336 --> 06:40.655
He was making phone calls in his
office early on, but from nine

06:40.656 --> 06:43.975
o'clock, he was working the floor
with the rest of the staff.

06:43.976 --> 06:45.895
So, he didn't go back through this
pass door at all?

06:45.896 --> 06:47.975
He said he may have done,
he was confused,

06:47.976 --> 06:51.575
he seemed very distracted
and worried about his niece.

06:51.576 --> 06:54.255
- His niece?
- Shelley Nardoni is his niece.

06:54.256 --> 06:57.923
- And he thinks she died in the fire?
- Yeah.

07:23.376 --> 07:26.455
It seems to me, the fire started
in the office,

07:26.456 --> 07:29.455
that's the worst affected room,
part of the ceiling's down,

07:29.456 --> 07:32.455
it wasn't even considered safe
to get in there initially.

07:32.456 --> 07:34.695
Now, there's clearly been
some flashover,

07:34.696 --> 07:37.816
there's a small window
about so wide,

07:37.976 --> 07:40.936
so high, quite high up
on that wall.

07:41.056 --> 07:43.535
Seemingly, staff stand on a chair

07:43.536 --> 07:45.015
and smoke out of it.

07:45.016 --> 07:46.816
Thanks, Andy.

07:46.936 --> 07:48.496
Sarah, strategy?

07:48.616 --> 07:49.895
Same as ever, really.

07:49.896 --> 07:51.735
Preliminary outside examination.

07:51.736 --> 07:53.255
Preliminary inside examination.

07:53.256 --> 07:55.255
Detailed outside, detailed inside.

07:55.256 --> 07:57.735
Recording and gathering anything
untoward outside,

07:57.736 --> 07:59.255
cigarette ends, tool marks,

07:59.256 --> 08:01.255
footwear marks, tyre tracks.

08:01.256 --> 08:03.775
Same inside,
anything of possible relevance.

08:03.776 --> 08:06.736
Looking at security systems, fuses,

08:06.856 --> 08:08.735
good or bad housekeeping.

08:08.736 --> 08:11.775
I'd also like to know
if any new electrical appliances

08:11.776 --> 08:13.735
or processes were installed recently

08:13.736 --> 08:16.535
and what's routinely left
plugged in and switched on,

08:16.536 --> 08:20.120
and we will, of course,
be adhering to this.

08:20.496 --> 08:22.975
It's all about the doors,
what was locked,

08:22.976 --> 08:24.476
what was unlocked,

08:24.536 --> 08:27.203
were there new codes, new locks?

08:27.216 --> 08:29.975
Did CCTV footage survive?
What's it telling us?

08:29.976 --> 08:32.495
Was there any trouble at the club,
or with the club?

08:32.496 --> 08:34.414
How was Secrets doing financially?

08:34.416 --> 08:36.294
What was the insurance on
that building?

08:36.296 --> 08:38.455
Was the cover expanded,
or the policy changed,

08:38.456 --> 08:40.373
what was there to gain?

08:40.416 --> 08:44.095
However, I might write this
on my own forehead, actually...

08:44.096 --> 08:46.415
Until we establish whether the fire

08:46.416 --> 08:48.536
was accidental or wilful,

08:48.616 --> 08:50.450
we go down both roads.

09:00.176 --> 09:01.479
- DI McKinven.
- Sir.

09:01.480 --> 09:02.863
- Jarvis.
- OK.

09:04.696 --> 09:05.776
Thank you.

09:09.816 --> 09:11.816
- All right.
- All right.

09:14.656 --> 09:16.615
So, Sarah, nothing's been touched,

09:16.616 --> 09:21.283
we've just secured the scene
and photographed everything.

09:23.736 --> 09:26.570
Hm... Well, here's the first body.

09:28.256 --> 09:30.735
Poor guy, he had no chance
of getting out.

09:30.736 --> 09:33.215
These fire doors were chained shut.

09:33.216 --> 09:36.133
Fire crew had to cut them open, eh?

09:47.976 --> 09:51.226
No soot here,
so there was direct flame.

09:57.296 --> 10:00.213
I think this is possibly a toaster.

10:00.816 --> 10:02.135
You've already captured this?

10:02.136 --> 10:04.136
- Yes.
- OK, if we can...

10:14.536 --> 10:15.855
No thermal insul.

10:15.856 --> 10:18.335
Could have been set on its side.

10:18.336 --> 10:20.216
Could have fallen.

10:20.336 --> 10:21.576
It could.

10:21.736 --> 10:25.486
- Sarah, Neil,
I'm through here.

10:26.136 --> 10:28.575
Some of these bone
fragments are very small

10:28.576 --> 10:30.375
and they've been dispersed
by the water jets,

10:30.376 --> 10:32.215
so no-one in here till
I've searched fully.

10:32.216 --> 10:33.383
Right you are.

10:33.456 --> 10:35.255
Professor Kathy Torrance.

10:35.256 --> 10:37.455
Kathy, this is Andy Jarvis,

10:37.456 --> 10:39.575
Fire Services Fire Investigator.

10:39.576 --> 10:40.616
Mm-hm.

10:51.096 --> 10:52.856
Over here, Sarah.

10:54.056 --> 10:55.976
The smokers' window.

10:56.136 --> 10:57.256
Yeah.

10:58.976 --> 11:01.295
What are you thinking
about these doors?

11:01.296 --> 11:05.615
Don't know yet. Could have gone to
flashover, even with them shut.

11:05.616 --> 11:09.855
The process running up to flashovers
are mostly fuel controlled.

11:09.856 --> 11:12.690
- These were boxes of crisps.
- Eh?

11:15.456 --> 11:19.873
Oil, crisps and plastic
are a really good fuel source.

11:22.256 --> 11:25.575
Well, you can see the fire travelled
out of here and into the kitchen.

11:25.576 --> 11:27.335
Or into here from the kitchen.

11:27.336 --> 11:29.095
Have you looked under
the body in the kitchen?

11:29.096 --> 11:31.930
We're waiting for the pathologist.

11:33.696 --> 11:35.096
Neil...

11:37.176 --> 11:39.343
There's another body here.

11:40.536 --> 11:42.096
So, three dead.

11:58.430 --> 12:00.069
You'll have to do it without her.

12:00.070 --> 12:02.154
OK, Mrs Muir. No problem.

12:02.910 --> 12:04.150
Hiya.

12:04.310 --> 12:06.030
Hello, Emma.

12:06.110 --> 12:07.777
Hi. I'm a bit early.

12:07.870 --> 12:10.029
Good. We've gone off piste today.

12:10.030 --> 12:12.909
Professor Gordon's at a fire scene
and sends her apologies.

12:12.910 --> 12:15.229
We're all at sixes and sevens,
because of the MOOC.

12:15.230 --> 12:18.829
Oh, this is Louise,
the post op you'll be working with.

12:18.830 --> 12:21.269
I'm a fool - she interviewed you.

12:21.270 --> 12:22.310
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:22.430 --> 12:25.589
Take Emma to HR, to get her own
e-mail and security lists

12:25.590 --> 12:26.909
and all that jazz.

12:26.910 --> 12:28.869
Did you do equality
and diversity training

12:28.870 --> 12:30.349
and health and safety training?

12:30.350 --> 12:31.429
Yeah, online.

12:31.430 --> 12:33.069
Shouldn't take too long then.

12:33.070 --> 12:35.149
I got this ready for you.

12:35.150 --> 12:38.269
- Guard it with your life.
- I will. Thank you.

12:38.270 --> 12:39.430
Come on.

12:41.150 --> 12:42.349
What's the MOOC?

12:42.350 --> 12:44.549
Massive Open Online Course.

12:44.550 --> 12:48.989
Forensic Science course set up by
SIFA, launches at midnight tonight.

12:48.990 --> 12:50.909
It's Professor Torrance's baby

12:50.910 --> 12:52.469
and Professor Gordon's.

12:52.470 --> 12:54.384
Well done for getting the job,
by the way.

12:54.385 --> 12:54.989
Thanks.

12:54.990 --> 12:56.829
There were a few good candidates,

12:56.830 --> 13:00.629
but me and Professor Gordon decided
you'd be the most fun.

13:00.630 --> 13:02.464
Welcome to your world.

13:03.270 --> 13:04.870
It's gorgeous.

13:04.990 --> 13:07.629
So, what Professor Gordon
suggests is we clean

13:07.630 --> 13:10.149
and check the GCMS before we set
up a sample run.

13:10.150 --> 13:12.549
We have dedicated use of this
one for the project,

13:12.550 --> 13:14.789
so that's great - it's called Bobby.

13:14.790 --> 13:16.550
Bobby, this is Emma.

13:16.670 --> 13:17.750
Hi, Bobby.

13:26.510 --> 13:28.909
You went straight into a lab
after uni, right?

13:28.910 --> 13:30.630
Yeah, in Manchester,

13:30.790 --> 13:32.290
near where I live.

13:32.470 --> 13:36.349
Testing soil samples
for chemical contamination.

13:36.350 --> 13:38.684
You OK being away from home?

13:39.550 --> 13:40.869
I was born here,

13:40.870 --> 13:42.589
so it's kind of home.

13:42.590 --> 13:43.710
Cool.

13:48.790 --> 13:52.350
- Emma.
- Professor Gordon.

13:52.470 --> 13:56.069
This is Professor Torrance. This is
Emma Hedges, my new lab technician.

13:56.070 --> 13:57.309
- Hi.
- Pleased to meet you.

13:57.310 --> 14:00.229
I'm so sorry I couldn't greet you
today, are you all set up?

14:00.230 --> 14:01.429
Yeah, all good.

14:01.430 --> 14:04.549
Great stuff. We'll kick off in
earnest when the samples arrive.

14:04.550 --> 14:06.869
- Great.
- I hope you'll be doing the MOOC.

14:06.870 --> 14:09.704
Definitely. Looking forward to it.

16:15.430 --> 16:16.990
I'm Sarah Gordon.

16:17.190 --> 16:20.269
I'm a professor of forensic
chemistry and the Director

16:20.270 --> 16:21.989
of SIFA, the Scottish Institute

16:21.990 --> 16:24.990
of Forensic Science and Anatomy.

16:25.150 --> 16:28.589
Over the next six weeks,
you'll be studying a fictional case,

16:28.590 --> 16:32.829
designed by us, to teach you
the principles of forensic science.

16:32.830 --> 16:34.869
You'll be learning about and tested

16:34.870 --> 16:36.749
on different aspects of the work.

16:36.750 --> 16:39.829
The course will culminate
in the identification of our body

16:39.830 --> 16:41.247
from its remains.

16:41.270 --> 16:42.937
Welcome to the MOOC.

16:44.910 --> 16:46.549
In the early hours of this morning,

16:46.550 --> 16:50.269
a dog walker discovered human
remains, here on Dundee Law,

16:50.270 --> 16:53.437
buried in a shallow
grave in the woods.

17:10.150 --> 17:12.069
Emma, Emma, love, what is it?

17:12.069 --> 17:15.069
The online course I'm doing
is using her story.

17:15.069 --> 17:16.109
What?

17:16.270 --> 17:19.069
A body buried in a shallow
grave on Law Hill.

17:19.069 --> 17:21.069
You're kidding!

17:21.230 --> 17:22.989
Discovered by a dog walker...

17:22.990 --> 17:24.630
- No.
- Yeah.

17:24.790 --> 17:27.348
Listen, there's only so many places

17:27.349 --> 17:29.629
you can bury a body in Dundee.

17:29.630 --> 17:31.350
Are you OK?

17:31.430 --> 17:32.789
My heart is pounding.

17:32.790 --> 17:34.550
Emma,

17:34.670 --> 17:35.950
stop doing it,

17:36.070 --> 17:38.987
shut your laptop up, try and sleep.

17:40.070 --> 17:41.830
OK. Night.

18:32.950 --> 18:35.549
- The primary forms
of identity can be established

18:35.550 --> 18:37.029
by studying bones.

18:37.030 --> 18:39.280
The super orbital eminences

18:39.310 --> 18:41.269
are heavier in the male.

18:41.270 --> 18:43.029
The frontal nasal angle

18:43.030 --> 18:44.989
is more acute in the male.

18:44.990 --> 18:48.349
The angle of the mandible
is ordinarily less

18:48.350 --> 18:50.749
than 125 degrees in the male,

18:50.750 --> 18:54.084
while the opposite is true
in the female.

19:08.750 --> 19:12.549
Study the skull from the human
remains that were recovered

19:12.550 --> 19:14.989
from the shallow grave on Law Hill.

19:14.990 --> 19:16.950
Male or female?

19:28.550 --> 19:30.269
It is her, they've got her skull.

19:30.270 --> 19:32.269
It can't be, it can't be her skull.

19:32.270 --> 19:37.104
I'm telling you, this woman
stood there, holding her skull.

19:45.030 --> 19:46.309
Professor Gordon...

19:46.310 --> 19:49.189
You're bright and early. Are you OK?

19:49.190 --> 19:51.690
The body in the MOOC's my mum.

19:52.730 --> 19:54.530
The fact is, Emma,

19:54.690 --> 19:59.409
we invented a crime to illustrate
the lessons we wanted to teach.

19:59.410 --> 20:01.369
There are trends in murder cases,

20:01.370 --> 20:04.787
archetypal features that
frequently occur.

20:05.210 --> 20:07.929
It's really common for a dog
to unearth human remains

20:07.930 --> 20:10.729
because their sense of smell
is superb.

20:10.730 --> 20:13.329
There are very few ways
to dispose of a body,

20:13.330 --> 20:14.849
and burial is one of them.

20:14.850 --> 20:15.969
We needed a burial,

20:15.970 --> 20:20.209
because soil analysis is a key
area of forensic science.

20:20.210 --> 20:23.569
There aren't many places
you can dig a grave in Dundee

20:23.570 --> 20:25.849
and it's 50-50
whether it's male or female

20:25.850 --> 20:29.329
and it's just horribly bad
luck for you we chose female.

20:29.330 --> 20:31.729
That must have been really
upsetting for you.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.849
I'm really sorry it brought
it all back up.

20:33.850 --> 20:35.329
Whose skull is it, then?

20:35.330 --> 20:37.410
It's a medical specimen,

20:37.490 --> 20:39.289
part of the university collection,

20:39.290 --> 20:41.040
donated in the 1940s.

20:46.970 --> 20:48.490
That's my mum,

20:48.610 --> 20:50.860
a month before we lost her.

20:51.490 --> 20:52.907
She looks lovely.

20:52.930 --> 20:55.769
Have you heard of her? Marie Monroe?

20:55.770 --> 20:59.354
Yes, because I've
lived in Dundee for years.

21:02.530 --> 21:05.130
- Here you go.
- Thanks, Janine.

21:07.650 --> 21:09.817
- Is this Greg's?
- Uh-huh.

21:10.890 --> 21:13.050
As in, Greg the person.

21:13.170 --> 21:14.569
Greg is our DNA maestro

21:14.570 --> 21:17.570
and this is first foray into baking.

21:17.690 --> 21:19.440
Cake is pivotal here.

21:20.210 --> 21:23.960
Greg has wisely kicked off
with a banana loaf.

21:28.570 --> 21:29.810
Not bad.

21:33.850 --> 21:36.049
I'm truly sorry you've had
such a shock, Emma,

21:36.050 --> 21:39.634
but your mother is not
the body in the MOOC.

21:51.210 --> 21:52.610
A button...

22:08.050 --> 22:10.967
I did know about her mother's case.

22:11.890 --> 22:13.557
What are you saying?

22:14.210 --> 22:17.729
That, that I... I must have been
aware of similarities.

22:17.730 --> 22:19.329
What do you mean, must have been?

22:19.330 --> 22:21.129
Were you aware
when we devised the MOOC?

22:21.130 --> 22:23.210
No, not consciously.

22:23.330 --> 22:26.329
It was my idea, the woman
buried on Law Hill, but Sarah,

22:26.330 --> 22:30.009
I was on the other side of the world
in 2001, so it's you who was here

22:30.010 --> 22:32.049
who needed to point out
to those of us who weren't

22:32.050 --> 22:34.369
- that we should avoid it.
- I know.

22:34.370 --> 22:37.489
I feel awful. I don't know how
I failed to connect it.

22:37.490 --> 22:38.849
You didn't work on it, did you?

22:38.850 --> 22:41.689
No, I... I followed it at the time.

22:41.690 --> 22:44.810
The investigation seemed
inept to me.

22:44.890 --> 22:46.974
What did you say to Emma?

22:48.050 --> 22:51.209
I said it wasn't Marie Monroe,
which it isn't.

22:51.210 --> 22:53.010
Did she accept that?

22:53.130 --> 22:55.970
I think so. Mostly...

22:56.130 --> 22:59.049
Wouldn't it really suck if we ended
up at court or had to pull

22:59.050 --> 23:01.649
the whole MOOC
because we used a real person?

23:01.650 --> 23:04.169
We need to check the rest of the
MOOC for any other similarities

23:04.170 --> 23:09.504
with the Marie Monroe case and take
every last trace of them out.

23:17.050 --> 23:18.330
Emma?

23:21.050 --> 23:24.134
Oh, my God, you look
so like your mum!

23:25.650 --> 23:28.734
- It's so good to see you.
- You, too!

23:29.730 --> 23:33.929
I've been able to get some blood out
of a protected artery in her neck,

23:33.930 --> 23:36.809
so we can check toxicology
as well as DNA.

23:36.810 --> 23:40.560
Good. We'll check her
against Shelley Nardoni.

23:40.770 --> 23:43.969
We won't get a full DNA
profile from these.

23:43.970 --> 23:46.889
We'll need to get his dentition
chartered by the odontologist.

23:46.890 --> 23:51.409
He's on his way. Bashir Kumar's
dental records are waiting for him.

23:51.410 --> 23:52.889
We get two matches,

23:52.890 --> 23:56.249
then we know which one of these
is the odd one out.

23:56.250 --> 23:59.129
Badly need an ID
for the unreported person.

23:59.130 --> 24:03.209
Can't really know what happened
until we know who it happened to.

24:03.210 --> 24:05.169
Neil, do you remember a murder case

24:05.170 --> 24:07.569
of a woman called Marie Monroe?

24:07.570 --> 24:09.130
Aye, I do.

24:10.690 --> 24:14.009
She went missing at a festival
by the docks. The Tall Ships.

24:14.010 --> 24:16.169
Assumption was she drowned,

24:16.170 --> 24:17.690
but no body.

24:17.810 --> 24:20.810
Three months' later, she was dug up.

24:21.370 --> 24:23.454
Never got any one for it.

24:26.210 --> 24:28.627
- I've got a job.
- As a what?

24:31.130 --> 24:33.609
A lab technician, working on a study

24:33.610 --> 24:35.889
to develop new tools and research

24:35.890 --> 24:39.569
around the analysis of new and
emerging street drugs in Scotland.

24:39.570 --> 24:41.570
I do that every weekend!

24:42.970 --> 24:44.169
You sound English.

24:44.170 --> 24:45.849
How'd you lose your accent?

24:45.850 --> 24:48.089
It just happened,
cos I moved away.

24:48.090 --> 24:50.169
- You staying with Jimmy?
- No way.

24:50.170 --> 24:52.254
I've got a place, it's...

24:52.690 --> 24:54.649
I'm going to find somewhere else.

24:54.650 --> 24:55.890
Stay with me.

24:56.050 --> 24:58.569
Skye, you've not seen me in years,
you can't just...

24:58.570 --> 25:01.209
We know each other. I'm serious.

25:01.210 --> 25:03.569
I'm staying at my mum's on my own.
I'd love the company.

25:03.570 --> 25:04.969
Where's your mum?

25:04.970 --> 25:07.049
Oh, Emma, she's... She's bad.

25:07.050 --> 25:08.967
Her lungs are terrible.

25:09.050 --> 25:10.569
I think she's dying.

25:10.570 --> 25:11.890
What?

25:12.090 --> 25:15.329
- She'd love to see you.
- I'd love to see her.

25:15.330 --> 25:17.769
We'll go. Have you seen your dad?

25:17.770 --> 25:20.050
No, not yet.

25:20.170 --> 25:21.689
I spoke to him a few weeks ago,

25:21.690 --> 25:23.689
but I think he's still travelling.

25:23.690 --> 25:27.489
Is he what? He's on half
the posters on the Perth Road!

25:27.490 --> 25:28.650
Go see him.

25:31.490 --> 25:34.407
Come and have a look.

25:36.530 --> 25:39.569
These were found wedged in the
toaster where the bread goes -

25:39.570 --> 25:42.089
- cardboard.
- So it was primed with fuel?

25:42.090 --> 25:43.489
It's had cardboard jammed in it,

25:43.490 --> 25:46.129
for some reason yet to be
established, you can see,

25:46.130 --> 25:48.047
when it's opened out...

25:51.650 --> 25:53.050
A barcode.

25:53.210 --> 25:55.329
Printed on a sticky label.

25:55.330 --> 25:57.188
You know how a label's
glossy and smooth?

25:57.189 --> 25:57.969
Uh-huh.

25:57.970 --> 26:01.489
The little spaces between the paper
fibres are filled with Kaolin -

26:01.490 --> 26:04.570
clay, so it burns more slowly.

26:04.730 --> 26:07.647
Hm... Pleased with that,
aren't you?

26:08.010 --> 26:09.570
Yes, I am, Neil.

26:09.690 --> 26:12.409
People think everything gets
destroyed by fire,

26:12.410 --> 26:14.409
almost everything leaves traces.

26:14.410 --> 26:17.249
If that's a delivery barcode,
you could get an address from it.

26:17.250 --> 26:19.929
You could. The other thing that
could be recoverable from inside

26:19.930 --> 26:23.289
folded cardboard, even as burnt
as this, is fingerprints.

26:23.290 --> 26:24.809
Well, that would be a dream.

26:24.810 --> 26:26.489
We'll get cracking with that.

26:26.490 --> 26:29.209
Right. You know how you can't get
this to stay clicked down,

26:29.210 --> 26:31.249
if your toaster's
switched off at the wall?

26:31.250 --> 26:32.014
I do.

26:32.016 --> 26:34.449
That's cos it's needs the flow
of electricity to activate

26:34.450 --> 26:36.809
the electromagnet,
that's what keeps it clicked down.

26:36.810 --> 26:39.649
When the electricity stops, after
however long it takes to toast

26:39.650 --> 26:41.209
your toast, it's not magnetised

26:41.210 --> 26:44.009
any more and the tray lift pops up.

26:44.010 --> 26:46.760
- Was this rigged?
- Here, look...

26:47.770 --> 26:51.104
A twist tie has been wrapped
around it...

26:51.690 --> 26:55.489
...so the tray lift couldn't
disconnect from the electromagnet.

26:55.490 --> 26:57.969
Huh... So why didn't
the thermal protection device

26:57.970 --> 27:00.409
kick in and break the circuit?

27:00.410 --> 27:01.930
It couldn't.

27:02.050 --> 27:04.769
A paper clip's been put across it
to hold it together,

27:04.770 --> 27:06.969
so the electricity
kept flowing through.

27:06.970 --> 27:08.769
The toaster kept heating up?

27:08.770 --> 27:09.890
Exactly.

27:15.970 --> 27:17.810
Emma, come and watch.

27:19.130 --> 27:22.889
Emma biked into town to buy it after
we deciphered the make and model.

27:22.890 --> 27:25.489
So, we've set up the toaster in
exactly the same way

27:25.490 --> 27:27.249
as we think it was done.

27:27.250 --> 27:28.250
Off we go.

27:30.690 --> 27:34.107
So, this is surely
the source of the fire.

27:34.770 --> 27:37.369
I think we're looking at
wilful fire-raising

27:37.370 --> 27:38.410
and murder.

27:40.570 --> 27:42.769
You won't be drawn, will you?

27:42.770 --> 27:45.089
I'll have to wait for your report.

27:45.090 --> 27:46.330
Yes, you will.

27:49.930 --> 27:52.129
Can I ring you later?
I need to ask you a favour.

27:52.130 --> 27:53.410
Yeah.

Aw. Hello, gorgeous!

29:02.450 --> 29:03.570
Hi, Dad.

29:13.970 --> 29:16.090
Whooooo!

29:18.050 --> 29:20.569
Oh, God, no...
I would have thought the same.

29:20.570 --> 29:23.450
It wasn't a rational reaction.

29:23.570 --> 29:26.009
This is your mother's murder
we're talking about here.

29:26.010 --> 29:27.689
How's that ever going to be
rational?

29:27.690 --> 29:30.769
Well, and then I get told
that my mother's murder's just a

29:30.770 --> 29:33.354
bog-standard stereotypical one.

29:34.210 --> 29:39.044
Not even a special one.
I mean, please, leave me something.

29:52.250 --> 29:54.530
Ah, you look so like her.

29:54.650 --> 29:56.400
What happened to her?

29:58.370 --> 29:59.620
Who killed her?

30:05.850 --> 30:07.050
I wish I knew.

30:11.530 --> 30:15.447
I think I've got to an age
where I need to know.

30:17.690 --> 30:20.940
I think maybe that's why
I've come back.

30:21.530 --> 30:23.529
Well, you can be defined

30:23.530 --> 30:25.889
by what happened to your mum,

30:25.890 --> 30:28.640
or you can choose to refuse that.

30:29.690 --> 30:30.690
I know.

30:32.490 --> 30:35.324
And I will always be here for you.

30:36.690 --> 30:40.607
I saw Skye today,
for the first time since 2002.

30:40.770 --> 30:43.437
- Was that sweet?
- Really sweet.

30:45.330 --> 30:47.850
But Izzy might be dying.

30:47.970 --> 30:50.054
Her lungs are packing up.

30:50.157 --> 30:51.237
Jeez, oh...

30:52.107 --> 30:53.347
Poor Izzy.

31:18.690 --> 31:20.450
Where will you sleep?

31:20.570 --> 31:21.770
Sofa.

31:24.130 --> 31:25.714
Goodnight, darling.

31:25.770 --> 31:27.020
Goodnight, dad.

31:32.524 --> 31:33.764
Thanks.

31:59.290 --> 32:00.330
Dad?

32:05.610 --> 32:06.930
Hello?

32:07.050 --> 32:09.335
- Is Drew there?
- No.

32:09.337 --> 32:11.489
He's got some stuff for me,
can I come in?

32:11.490 --> 32:13.770
- No.
- I need my stuff.

32:13.930 --> 32:15.609
I know where it is,
just let me in!

32:15.610 --> 32:16.650
No.

32:16.770 --> 32:19.409
Thanks for nothing!

32:19.410 --> 32:20.609
Tell Drew I'll be coming back.

32:20.610 --> 32:22.529
Shit, shit, shit... What the fuck?

32:22.530 --> 32:23.970
Thanks, Dad...

32:25.610 --> 32:27.969
- You're through to Drew,
you know what to do.

32:27.970 --> 32:31.804
Leave a message,
I'll get straight back to you.

32:39.530 --> 32:41.864
Fuck! Where does he keep it?

32:44.050 --> 32:45.250
Fucking hell.

33:47.869 --> 33:49.469
- Sarah.
- Hey.

33:51.229 --> 33:53.549
You played a blinder.

33:53.669 --> 33:55.428
The barcode on the cardboard,

33:55.429 --> 33:58.188
it led us to a woman at an address
in Hilltown.

33:58.189 --> 34:00.548
She remembers putting that
packaging in the recycling bin

34:00.549 --> 34:02.668
shared by the whole block of flats.

34:02.669 --> 34:04.868
Shuggie Brooke lives at number 12.

34:04.869 --> 34:07.308
- The manager?
- The manager of Secrets, aye.

34:07.309 --> 34:09.308
And naturally,
we want to go down and ask Mr Brooke

34:09.309 --> 34:11.308
if he'd fished the cardboard
out of the bin,

34:11.309 --> 34:13.027
jammed it in a toaster
that he'd rigged

34:13.029 --> 34:14.868
and set his nightclub on fire,

34:14.869 --> 34:16.703
- but, we can't.
- Why?

34:16.789 --> 34:22.348
Cos Shuggie Brooke jumped off the
Tay Bridge the day before yesterday.

34:22.349 --> 34:24.509
- Oh, God.
- I know.

34:24.668 --> 34:27.148
Listen, Sarah, I'm sorry I couldn't
help you with that favour.

34:27.149 --> 34:29.228
Oh, don't be daft, Neil, I get it.

34:29.228 --> 34:31.646
- Have a nice day.
- You, too.

34:39.109 --> 34:40.748
Oh, thank you.

34:40.909 --> 34:42.388
What about the MOOC then?

34:42.389 --> 34:45.109
23,000 people.

34:45.228 --> 34:46.978
I know, it's amazing.

34:49.149 --> 34:51.628
So, everyone's raving
about your banana loaf.

34:51.629 --> 34:53.463
Ha... Beginner's luck.

34:54.509 --> 34:55.949
Greg, um...

35:02.229 --> 35:03.828
A person has sex with a person

35:03.829 --> 35:05.996
while working out of town.

35:06.389 --> 35:10.348
Months later, the person gets
a postcard from the person

35:10.349 --> 35:12.933
saying they're coming to visit.

35:13.589 --> 35:16.868
The person can't get in touch with
the person to ask for more details,

35:16.869 --> 35:19.468
because they never
exchanged numbers.

35:19.469 --> 35:21.868
How did the person know
the person's address?

35:21.869 --> 35:24.268
They know where the person works.

35:24.269 --> 35:25.686
Was the sex good?

35:28.309 --> 35:29.559
I believe so...

35:30.589 --> 35:32.229
OK.

35:32.309 --> 35:33.829
Well, I think...

35:35.309 --> 35:36.669
Lucky person?

35:39.149 --> 35:41.399
I'll pass it along, thanks.

35:51.109 --> 35:54.428
The remains in the office are the
two members of staff reported

35:54.429 --> 35:56.268
missing, Shelley and Bashir,

35:56.269 --> 35:58.436
DNA and dentition matched.

36:00.589 --> 36:02.188
And the fleshed
remains in the kitchen?

36:02.189 --> 36:05.868
There's no match for his DNA
on the database - they're stuck.

36:05.869 --> 36:07.748
He could be the one who set
the place on fire.

36:07.749 --> 36:09.908
Shuggie Brooke's prints
on the cardboard doesn't prove

36:09.909 --> 36:11.308
he started the fire.

36:11.309 --> 36:13.428
Three people died
and then he jumped off a bridge.

36:13.429 --> 36:15.388
That says to me he felt responsible.

36:15.389 --> 36:18.108
Well, he had boxes of crisps
piled high in his office,

36:18.109 --> 36:21.028
that probably drove it to flashover.

36:21.029 --> 36:24.388
Corridor to office, corridor
to kitchen, kitchen to office.

36:24.389 --> 36:25.806
All three locked.

36:25.869 --> 36:27.868
I've identified the manufacturer
of these doors.

36:27.869 --> 36:30.628
We've sent what's left of them
to be tested in Edinburgh.

36:30.629 --> 36:33.463
Where are we at with Marie Monroe?

36:35.069 --> 36:37.388
The rest of module one was fine,

36:37.389 --> 36:41.788
age, height and ethnicity of our
body all differ from Marie Monroe.

36:41.789 --> 36:43.628
There are five more modules.

36:43.629 --> 36:46.508
I know, I asked Neil to crosscheck
it, but he needs a bona fide

36:46.509 --> 36:49.148
policing purpose to access
the Marie Monroe files.

36:49.149 --> 36:51.268
So, we apply for the whole
Data Protection thing

36:51.269 --> 36:54.019
and hope it doesn't take forever.

36:55.069 --> 36:57.748
Sarah, can I say something annoying?

36:57.749 --> 36:59.029
Always.

36:59.189 --> 37:02.308
It's very rare for you to make
a mistake, but when you do,

37:02.309 --> 37:06.548
you dwell on it and while you're
dwelling on it, you make another.

37:06.549 --> 37:09.799
Don't beat yourself up,
it won't fix it.

37:11.749 --> 37:13.029
Thank you.

37:18.789 --> 37:21.668
- Leave a message,
I'll get straight back to you.

37:21.669 --> 37:25.468
Dad, how many times do I have to
ring you before you ring me back?

37:25.469 --> 37:26.749
Bye.

37:30.749 --> 37:32.029
Hiya.

37:34.469 --> 37:36.229
Let me look at you.

37:38.589 --> 37:40.589
You are the spit of her.

37:42.029 --> 37:43.589
Isn't she?

37:43.709 --> 37:45.269
Aren't you? Oh...

37:46.429 --> 37:48.789
- Hello, Emma.
- Hello, Izzy.

37:50.149 --> 37:51.628
Give her her face back, Mum!

37:51.629 --> 37:53.629
Oh, one wee minute more!

37:55.789 --> 37:57.789
There, I've let her go,

37:57.909 --> 37:59.869
but leave your hand.

38:02.269 --> 38:04.429
Do you smoke?

38:04.509 --> 38:06.669
- Yeah.
- Well, don't.

38:07.789 --> 38:10.708
Don't be like me, that's what
I say to you, isn't it?

38:10.709 --> 38:13.126
Aye, as you offer me a light!

38:13.469 --> 38:14.719
She's terrible!

38:16.229 --> 38:17.789
Look at you.

38:17.869 --> 38:20.269
We had fun, didn't we?

38:20.389 --> 38:23.389
Our wee after school club, remember?

38:23.429 --> 38:26.429
I used to love playing
at your house.

38:27.949 --> 38:30.116
Oh, Marie, Marie, Marie...

38:32.869 --> 38:34.869
I still dream about her.

38:35.589 --> 38:36.749
Do you?

38:40.789 --> 38:42.623
You see, in my mind...

38:43.749 --> 38:45.108
...she never died.

38:45.109 --> 38:48.193
- Here we go. Mum...
- No, let me say.

38:52.429 --> 38:55.749
In my mind, she stepped onto

38:55.869 --> 38:58.453
one of those beautiful ships...

38:59.589 --> 39:01.508
...on the arm of a handsome stranger,

39:01.509 --> 39:04.343
and sailed away to a better place.

39:08.389 --> 39:11.268
I know they found her remains,
I know they identified her,

39:11.269 --> 39:13.519
but I just don't accept it.

39:15.429 --> 39:17.828
I just won't have it
that my sweet Marie ended up

39:17.829 --> 39:21.329
dumped in the ground
with her bones cut up.

39:45.071 --> 39:46.162
Hello, love.

39:46.164 --> 39:48.628
Why has no-one ever told me
my mother was dismembered?

39:48.629 --> 39:50.469
Say again. Was, what?

39:50.589 --> 39:51.673
She was what?

39:51.829 --> 39:53.308
Dismembered, cut up.

39:53.309 --> 39:54.908
Who told you she was? She wasn't.

39:54.909 --> 39:55.989
Izzy Alessi.

39:56.149 --> 40:00.788
That's not true, OK. I never heard
anybody saying anything like that.

40:00.789 --> 40:01.949
Are you sure?

40:02.029 --> 40:03.669
Yes.

40:03.869 --> 40:07.508
Look, I think I would remember if my
sister's body had been dismembered.

40:07.509 --> 40:10.428
I mean, and I don't think
Izzy Alessi can be relied on.

40:10.429 --> 40:12.388
I don't think you can be relied on.

40:12.389 --> 40:13.788
I beg your pardon?

40:13.789 --> 40:17.028
You controlled everything that
I was told, you withheld things.

40:17.029 --> 40:19.509
No, Emma, you were seven, OK.

40:19.709 --> 40:21.948
I can't talk to you right now,
sorry.

40:21.949 --> 40:23.389
No, Emma, Emma!

40:31.949 --> 40:34.428
- And it's these facts
that can lead us to answer

40:34.429 --> 40:36.428
the questions, who was this person?

40:36.429 --> 40:37.868
What happened to them?

40:37.869 --> 40:39.828
There are many forms of identity,

40:39.829 --> 40:42.163
physical, digital, social...

40:43.309 --> 40:45.309
- Jimmy, hi.
- Hi.

40:47.589 --> 40:50.339
- Coffee?
- I'm all right, thanks.

40:59.029 --> 41:01.908
I can't believe you're working
in Dundee and didn't tell me.

41:01.909 --> 41:03.909
Well, I've told you now.

41:05.789 --> 41:08.268
I hope next time you'll
come to the house.

41:08.269 --> 41:10.508
Olga and the twins
would love to see you.

41:10.509 --> 41:12.108
Your brother would love to see you.

41:12.109 --> 41:13.509
Half-brother...

41:13.629 --> 41:14.828
Don't be like that.

41:14.829 --> 41:16.829
You're better than that.

41:19.349 --> 41:21.433
Thank you for coming out.

41:21.949 --> 41:23.668
I need to ask you
something difficult,

41:23.669 --> 41:26.028
that's why I didn't come to the
house, but I will come soon.

41:26.029 --> 41:27.109
Good.

41:28.589 --> 41:30.589
You can ask me anything.

41:33.269 --> 41:35.708
Jimmy, when they found
Mum's remains,

41:35.709 --> 41:37.793
was her body dismembered?

41:40.509 --> 41:42.593
Was her body dismembered?

41:43.669 --> 41:44.749
Yeah.

41:45.949 --> 41:47.748
Why are you asking me that?

41:47.749 --> 41:49.468
Because Izzy Alessi told me she was.

41:49.469 --> 41:51.308
- Don't listen to Izzy Alessi.
- Why?

41:51.309 --> 41:53.068
Because she's a druggy.

41:53.069 --> 41:55.903
You and Julie kept things from me.

41:56.069 --> 41:58.069
Yes, we did,

41:58.189 --> 41:59.439
to protect you.

42:00.669 --> 42:02.586
I'm old enough to know.

42:04.949 --> 42:10.388
I can't honour what Mum suffered
if I don't know what she suffered.

42:10.389 --> 42:13.148
Do you remember the police
questioning you?

42:13.149 --> 42:14.269
Yeah.

42:14.429 --> 42:16.468
"What did Jimmy do
after he took you home?

42:16.469 --> 42:18.229
"Did Jimmy go out?

42:18.349 --> 42:20.599
"Did Jimmy ever hurt Mummy?

42:21.149 --> 42:22.708
"Was mummy scared of Jimmy?

42:22.709 --> 42:24.268
"Is Jimmy a nice stepdad?"

42:24.269 --> 42:25.269
I remember.

42:25.389 --> 42:26.889
They suspected me.

42:27.829 --> 42:30.913
They never said as much,
but they did.

42:33.109 --> 42:34.943
They told me nothing..

42:35.949 --> 42:38.068
...and then they failed us.

42:38.069 --> 42:39.628
Mum was scared of you.

42:39.629 --> 42:41.069
I was. too.

42:41.229 --> 42:43.509
Not you - your temper.

42:43.629 --> 42:45.213
I do have a temper.

42:46.629 --> 42:48.546
I hate it about myself,

42:48.549 --> 42:51.348
but no-one needs to be scared of me.

42:51.349 --> 42:52.989
Emma...

42:53.149 --> 42:56.589
I swear I never heard
a word about...

42:56.709 --> 42:58.126
...dismemberment.

43:00.949 --> 43:03.699
When was it mum cut her hair off?

43:04.429 --> 43:06.513
I was trying to remember.

43:07.149 --> 43:08.309
Er...

43:08.469 --> 43:10.908
Must have been when you
were about six,

43:10.909 --> 43:13.243
not long before we lost her.

43:38.949 --> 43:41.388
- Hey.
- I'm really sorry, I hope you don't mind,

43:41.389 --> 43:43.508
I need someone to talk to
and I thought of you.

43:43.509 --> 43:45.926
Come in. Come in, talk to me.

43:47.029 --> 43:49.446
It's about my mum's murder...

43:49.709 --> 43:50.789
Oh...

43:50.949 --> 43:54.388
Emma, no, I'm sorry, I'm not the
right person to talk to about that.

43:54.389 --> 43:56.948
I've heard things that I think
could be important.

43:56.949 --> 43:59.228
Someone told me that she was
dismembered and then I found..

43:59.229 --> 44:00.549
Emma, stop.

44:03.549 --> 44:06.068
I would love to be able to help,
but this is not for my ears,

44:06.069 --> 44:08.868
- you need to talk to the police.
- This is my mum and dad.

44:08.869 --> 44:10.948
Except at the time
the photo was taken,

44:10.949 --> 44:15.108
my mum wasn't with my dad -
she was with my stepdad.

44:15.109 --> 44:18.228
I think it could have something
to do with her murder.

44:18.229 --> 44:19.868
- Ring me if you ever, um...
- What?

44:19.869 --> 44:21.203
Want to ring me.

44:21.309 --> 44:22.429
I was stupid,

44:22.589 --> 44:25.188
doing things which maybe made a fire
turn into a really bad fire.

44:25.189 --> 44:27.668
She knows something that was
never disclosed.

44:27.669 --> 44:29.228
I think we need to look out for her.

44:29.229 --> 44:32.388
When I drove over that bridge,
I had to wait for a guy to jump off.

44:32.389 --> 44:34.056
He started the fire.

44:34.109 --> 44:36.068
I think you need to stop sleuthing.

44:36.069 --> 44:39.319
You don't know what you're
getting into.
