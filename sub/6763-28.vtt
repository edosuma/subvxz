{\an3}The reason I didn't
call you back is

06:44.737 --> 06:46.656
Donna, last week

06:46.739 --> 06:50.660
{\an6}an announcement was made
in one of your classes--
did you hear it?

06:50.743 --> 06:52.662
Yes.

06:52.745 --> 06:55.498
{\an3}In that case, I'd
like you to tell us

06:55.581 --> 06:56.999
{\an3}what you understood
it to mean?

06:59.085 --> 07:02.672
That if anyone
was drunk at prom,

07:02.755 --> 07:04.632
they wouldn't be able
to graduate.

07:04.715 --> 07:07.135
That's the gist of it.

07:07.218 --> 07:07.718
Were you drunk, Donna?

07:08.803 --> 07:12.014
You don't know?

07:12.098 --> 07:14.350
Mrs. Teasley said you collapsed

07:14.433 --> 07:15.685
on the floor of the lobby

07:15.768 --> 07:17.520
{\an3}of the Bel Age Hotel--
that, in fact,

07:17.603 --> 07:21.190
you were so drunk you could
barely make it to the car.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.317
I don't exactly remember.

07:23.401 --> 07:24.527
{\an3}Well, let's start
earlier in the evening.

07:24.610 --> 07:27.530
What <i> do</i> you remember?

07:27.613 --> 07:30.575
{\an3}Do you remember how
much you had to drink?

07:32.618 --> 07:34.871
I just had
two glasses of champagne.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.039
Two glasses?

07:37.123 --> 07:39.542
Two, maybe three.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.085
Where did you have

07:41.169 --> 07:43.963
these two... or three glasses?

07:45.798 --> 07:48.718
At a pre-prom party
at a friend's house.

07:48.801 --> 07:53.598
His father poured a little bit
for everyone who wasn't driving.

07:56.350 --> 07:59.061
I hadn't eaten all day,
Mr. Ephardt.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.647
I didn't know
it would hit me like that.

08:02.815 --> 08:06.736
Donna, do you know
the legal drinking age

08:06.819 --> 08:08.571
in this state?

08:08.654 --> 08:10.740
No one sold her
any liquor, George.

08:10.823 --> 08:14.076
She drank some wine
at a private home.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.370
Do you, Donna?

08:16.454 --> 08:17.830
Yes, I do.

08:21.500 --> 08:22.835
What's going to happen to me?

08:23.836 --> 08:25.129
Someone please tell me.

08:25.213 --> 08:27.715
I'm sorry, Donna,
you're hereby suspended,

08:27.798 --> 08:30.593
{\an3}pending a hearing tonight

08:30.676 --> 08:31.928

of Education.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.554

gets thrown out of school,

stop the presses.

09:00.581 --> 09:01.749
Or we publish an extra.

09:01.832 --> 09:03.292

{\an3}Mom, Mel didn't
get anybody drunk.

10:09.191 --> 10:11.819
{\an3}He just had a couple
of bottles of champagne,

10:11.902 --> 10:13.738
enough for everybody
to make a toast to.

10:13.821 --> 10:14.739

Well, they finally
met our offer.

10:27.668 --> 10:28.836
And because they've already sold

10:28.919 --> 10:30.880

to move in as soon as possible.

thing go away.

How do you think <i> I</i> feel.

11:31.857 --> 11:33.943
I'm the one
who isn't gonna graduate.

11:34.026 --> 11:35.986
Well, I guess
you should've thought

11:36.070 --> 11:37.446
of that before you got drunk.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.989
Mom, everyone drank.

11:39.073 --> 11:40.991
Why do you think Drive Alive

11:41.075 --> 11:42.451
gave us quarters
for the telephone?

11:42.535 --> 11:43.619
{\an3}Donna,

11:43.702 --> 11:46.122
you passed out
in front of the vice principal.

11:46.205 --> 11:47.748
{\an3}MARTIN:
Honey,

11:47.832 --> 11:49.792
I want you go upstairs
and get dressed, all right?

11:49.875 --> 11:51.585
We don't want to be late
for the meeting.

11:51.669 --> 11:52.628
{\an3}Go ahead.

11:52.711 --> 11:54.797
Okay, Daddy.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.800
{\an5}FELICE:
Would you please try to find
something dignified to wear?

12:02.054 --> 12:03.806
{\an5}KELLY:
So how long is this hearing
supposed to last?

12:03.889 --> 12:06.142
I don't know.

12:06.225 --> 12:07.476
The disciplinary
committee hearings

12:07.560 --> 12:08.644
take place behind closed doors.

12:08.727 --> 12:09.478
I've never been to one before.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.647
{\an1}Well, maybe we should
all go down there.

12:11.730 --> 12:13.149
She just said the
hearing is closed.

12:13.232 --> 12:14.775
{\an3}Besides, it's
probably over by now.

12:14.859 --> 12:17.611
{\an3}NAT:
Donna's on the phone.

12:17.695 --> 12:18.654
Who wants to take it?

12:18.737 --> 12:20.156
I will.

12:23.075 --> 12:25.202
Donna, what happened?

12:25.286 --> 12:26.996
I lost.

12:27.079 --> 12:29.123
{\an5}(voice breaking):
They won't let me graduate
with you guys.

12:29.206 --> 12:30.708
Oh, Donna.

12:30.791 --> 12:31.167
I'm suspended

12:31.250 --> 12:33.169
for five days,

12:33.252 --> 12:35.838
and then I can come back,

12:35.921 --> 12:38.007
but I can't participate
in graduation

12:38.090 --> 12:39.633
or any other senior activities.

12:39.717 --> 12:42.178
I'm so sorry.

12:42.261 --> 12:45.055
And I have to go to
summer school till August,

12:45.139 --> 12:46.056
and then I can get my diploma.

12:46.140 --> 12:50.019
And I have to go
into a substance abuse program

12:50.102 --> 12:52.646
at the Maple Center.

12:52.730 --> 12:53.439
You?

12:53.522 --> 12:56.317
You don't have
a drinking problem.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.110
Maybe I do.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.862
Donna, that's ridiculous.

12:59.945 --> 13:01.989
This whole thing is ridiculous.

13:02.072 --> 13:06.869
I know, but my parents
won't even appeal.

13:06.952 --> 13:10.164
And my mother says
that I deserve it.

13:10.247 --> 13:13.834
Maybe I do.

13:13.918 --> 13:17.630
Brenda, it's just not fair.

13:17.713 --> 13:20.758
I just want to get my diploma
with you guys.

13:20.841 --> 13:22.218
We're with you, Donna.

13:22.301 --> 13:23.677
Just hold it together, okay?

13:23.761 --> 13:24.929
(softly):
Yeah.

13:37.441 --> 13:38.400
Well?

13:38.484 --> 13:40.736
You guys are never going
to believe this.

13:40.819 --> 13:42.947
{\an3}They're throwing
her out of school.

13:43.030 --> 13:44.740
{\an3}She's not going to
get to graduate.

13:44.823 --> 13:45.157
{\an1}STEVE:
Man!

13:45.241 --> 13:47.576
{\an3}I told you.

13:47.660 --> 13:48.744
{\an1}So much for Felice Martin's
influence-peddling.

13:48.827 --> 13:50.246
{\an1}BRENDA:
And get this:

13:50.329 --> 13:51.205
Mrs. Martin is
totally caving.

13:51.288 --> 13:53.707
{\an3}They're not even going
to file an appeal.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.751
{\an1}She's got a lot of
integrity, that Felice.

13:55.834 --> 13:56.794
{\an3}Maybe we should
tell them

13:56.877 --> 13:57.753
{\an1}that we were all drinking
Saturday night.

13:57.836 --> 13:59.964
{\an1}What, are you crazy?
What good would that do?

14:00.047 --> 14:02.716
Well, if they could see that
Donna wasn't the only one...

14:02.800 --> 14:03.592
{\an3}They'd throw us all
out of school, David.

14:03.676 --> 14:07.012
{\an1}Look, they all know
we were together.

14:07.096 --> 14:08.764
{\an1}She just better not
name names.

14:08.847 --> 14:10.224
Donna wouldn't do that,
you know it.

14:10.307 --> 14:12.601
{\an3}Well, I guess this is
all pretty hopeless

14:12.685 --> 14:13.602
{\an1}ANDREA:
Yeah. isn't it?

14:13.686 --> 14:15.604
{\an1}Especially up against
those lip service

14:15.688 --> 14:17.731
hypocrites on the school board.

14:17.815 --> 14:18.857
Guys, I love Donna.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.609
{\an1}I'd love to hang out
here all night,

14:20.693 --> 14:21.944
{\an1}but I got to study
for the finals.

14:22.027 --> 14:23.612
Yeah, me, too.

14:23.696 --> 14:27.241
Yeah, and I have to put the
entire contents of my life

14:27.324 --> 14:28.784
into a moving box.

14:28.867 --> 14:30.869
Adios, amigos.

14:32.871 --> 14:34.748
{\an3}Andrea, wait a second,
wait a second.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.296
{\an3}Are we all just
wimping out here?

14:40.379 --> 14:42.006
{\an1}You mean were Howard
and Tobi right about us?

14:42.089 --> 14:44.300
{\an3}Yeah.

14:44.383 --> 14:45.175
{\an3}You and I both know
the only thing Donna did

14:45.259 --> 14:47.595
{\an3}that we all didn't do
was get caught.

14:47.678 --> 14:49.805
{\an1}Brandon, at this point,
that is totally irrelevant.

14:49.888 --> 14:51.974
{\an1}I mean, they are looking
to make an example of her.

14:52.057 --> 14:53.309
{\an1}If there's not
going to be an appeal,

14:53.392 --> 14:55.519
{\an1}there's not a whole lot
we can do about it.

14:57.354 --> 14:58.355
I'm sorry.

15:07.114 --> 15:08.782
KELLY:
<i>I can't study.</i>

15:08.866 --> 15:11.160
{\an3}I just keep thinking
about Donna.

15:11.243 --> 15:12.369
Yeah?

15:12.453 --> 15:15.164
{\an3}Yeah, I mean, I can't believe
her parents won't appeal.

15:15.247 --> 15:16.498
{\an3}My mom would
stick up for me.

15:16.582 --> 15:17.499
I know she would.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.002
{\an1}Oh, well, your mom's
pretty cool.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.463
{\an3}You're not going
to believe how cool.

15:22.546 --> 15:23.088
How cool?

15:23.172 --> 15:24.256
Well...

15:24.340 --> 15:27.176
I asked her if I could
spend the night here.

15:27.259 --> 15:29.553
Guess what she said?

15:29.637 --> 15:30.679
Really?

15:30.763 --> 15:31.722
Really.

15:31.805 --> 15:33.515
Well, not really.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.726
{\an3}But she's so stressed out
with the move and everything

15:35.809 --> 15:37.269
that I don't think
she even heard me.

15:37.353 --> 15:39.146
{\an1}We'll give her
the benefit of the doubt.

15:39.229 --> 15:41.231
How 'bout that?

15:45.819 --> 15:47.154
{\an3}You really want to go
to Berkeley, don't you?

15:47.237 --> 15:49.490
I don't know.

15:49.573 --> 15:51.492
I mean, I like it there.

15:51.575 --> 15:53.160
I'd miss you.

15:53.243 --> 15:55.329
Come on, Kel,

15:55.412 --> 15:57.164
there are planes leaving for
the Bay Area every half an hour,

15:57.247 --> 15:59.166
{\an1}and besides, no one's
going anywhere yet.

15:59.249 --> 16:03.837
I've got to get in first.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.089
Well, just don't ask me

16:05.172 --> 16:06.548
{\an3}for a letter of
recommendation, okay?

16:06.632 --> 16:08.884
{\an1}Yeah, well, if I don't
do some studying tonight,

16:08.967 --> 16:11.804
{\an1}I don't think
that'll be an issue.

16:11.887 --> 16:14.264
In that case,
you come here.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.274
{\an5}MEL:
<i>I hope I didn't do anything</i>
<i>to offend either of you.</i>

16:24.358 --> 16:27.569
{\an1}In my family, we always
served a little wine

16:27.653 --> 16:29.363
{\an1}to celebrate
a special occasion.

16:29.446 --> 16:31.907
I had no idea it would
affect Donna that way.

16:31.990 --> 16:33.575
Hey, it's all right.

16:33.659 --> 16:34.326
{\an1}I'm going
over there tonight

16:34.410 --> 16:37.121
{\an1}to apologize
to Donna's parents.

16:37.204 --> 16:40.082
And try and get 'em
to appeal this whole thing.

16:40.165 --> 16:41.250
Good luck.

16:41.333 --> 16:42.876
{\an3}Felice Martin is
a very stubborn woman.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.878
Well, I may not like
Felice's politics,

16:44.962 --> 16:47.548
but I suppose I owe her
an apology.

16:47.631 --> 16:50.175
After all, if this is
anybody's fault, it's mine.

16:50.259 --> 16:52.261
You know, we all
drank that night,

16:52.344 --> 16:54.263
none of the rest
of us got sick.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.432
Wait a minute,
has it occurred to anybody

16:56.515 --> 16:59.226
that nobody's even bothered
to prove Donna was drunk?

16:59.309 --> 17:01.270
Maybe she had a virus.

17:01.353 --> 17:02.438
If this was a real courtroom,

17:02.521 --> 17:03.605
someone would at least
have to ask

17:03.689 --> 17:04.647
that question.

17:04.732 --> 17:06.608
Well, it sounds like
unless her parents appeal,

17:06.692 --> 17:08.694
no one's going to have a chance
to ask any questions.

17:10.319 --> 17:12.740
(doorbell rings)

17:18.412 --> 17:20.122
Mel.

17:20.204 --> 17:23.125
Hello, Felice.

17:23.208 --> 17:23.541
Uh, may we come in?

17:23.625 --> 17:25.377
No, you may not.

17:27.337 --> 17:30.132
{\an1}Then I'll say what
I have to say right here.

17:30.215 --> 17:33.302
{\an1}I served our children
champagne

17:33.385 --> 17:34.178
{\an1}to celebrate
their graduation.

17:34.261 --> 17:37.431
It was my decision,

17:37.514 --> 17:39.767
{\an1}and Donna didn't
do anything wrong.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.185
{\an3}Mrs. Martin,
it's not fair.

17:41.268 --> 17:43.187
{\an3}You've got
to appeal this.

17:43.270 --> 17:44.980
There was a rule.

17:45.063 --> 17:46.106
Donna broke it.

17:46.190 --> 17:47.733
I thank you both
for stopping by.

17:47.816 --> 17:48.317
{\an3}Mel, I appreciate
your honesty.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.318
{\an3}Well, can I

17:49.401 --> 17:51.195
No.k to Donna?

17:54.907 --> 17:56.200
Well, that went over big.

17:57.284 --> 17:59.286
{\an3}I don't
understand, Mom.

17:59.369 --> 18:01.497
Dr. Silver's right.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.165
{\an3}Why aren't we
appealing this?

18:03.248 --> 18:05.375
{\an3}I just want to graduate
with my friends.

18:05.459 --> 18:07.336
Please, Mom.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.046
Donna, listen to me.

18:09.129 --> 18:09.421
I have done everything

18:09.505 --> 18:10.339
in my power.

18:10.422 --> 18:13.050
{\an1}I have used
all my influence

18:13.133 --> 18:14.343
with the board,
and nothing has worked.

18:14.426 --> 18:16.178
Now, I refuse
to put this family or you

18:16.261 --> 18:18.222
{\an1}through any further
humiliation.

18:18.305 --> 18:20.349
You can't forgive me,
can you, Mom?

18:20.432 --> 18:22.351
That's what this is
really about.

18:22.434 --> 18:25.312
It's not about the board,
it's about you.

18:25.395 --> 18:27.356
{\an3}You're great at
making the rules,

18:27.439 --> 18:29.149
but you don't exactly
live by them.

18:29.233 --> 18:30.275
What is that supposed to mean?

18:30.359 --> 18:32.361
Come on, Mom, do you really want
me to have to say it?

18:32.444 --> 18:35.906
Okay. You had an affair--
do you rDonna!r that?

18:35.989 --> 18:38.325
You were just having
some harmless fun.

18:38.408 --> 18:40.369
In fact, it was at
the Bel Age Hotel, just like me.

18:40.452 --> 18:42.371
And just like me,
you got caught.

18:42.454 --> 18:43.372
I caught you.

18:43.455 --> 18:44.248
That has nothing to do
with this.

18:44.331 --> 18:47.709
Yes, it has something
to do with this.

18:47.793 --> 18:50.838
This is about forgiveness.

18:50.921 --> 18:53.549
Mom, Daddy and I forgave you.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.302
Why can't you just forgive me?

19:05.644 --> 19:06.395
{\an3}What are you guys
doing here?

19:06.478 --> 19:09.731
Got called out
of AP English.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.191
We're supposed to
see Mrs. Teasley.

19:11.275 --> 19:13.569
Me, too.

19:13.652 --> 19:15.737
Damn, Donna sold us out.

19:15.821 --> 19:16.905
I don't believe it.

19:16.989 --> 19:17.865
Me either.

19:17.948 --> 19:19.741
{\an3}Well, at least you're
in the clear, bro.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.535
{\an3}Everybody knows you
don't touch the stuff.

19:21.618 --> 19:23.245
Guilty by association.

19:23.328 --> 19:25.247
It's true.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.499
{\an3}Hi. Is this what
I think it is?

19:27.583 --> 19:28.584
{\an1}STEVE:
Bingo.

19:28.667 --> 19:29.751
What's going on?

19:29.835 --> 19:31.545
Well, it seems that
Donna sold us out.

19:31.628 --> 19:32.379
{\an1}Well, what are we
gonna tell 'em?

19:32.462 --> 19:33.380
{\an1}STEVE:
Nothing.

19:33.463 --> 19:35.924
{\an3}We're gonna tell
them nothing.

19:36.008 --> 19:36.800
{\an3}Steve, if Donna
already said

19:36.884 --> 19:38.260
{\an3}that we were drinking,
there's no use

19:38.343 --> 19:38.719
in lying to them.

19:38.802 --> 19:40.262
Hey, come on,

19:40.345 --> 19:41.513
{\an3}it's her word against
ours, right?

19:41.597 --> 19:43.557
{\an1}No, Steve, you're missing
the point, man.

19:43.640 --> 19:44.808
We're here to corroborate.

19:44.892 --> 19:46.184
They want to talk to us

19:46.268 --> 19:47.394
{\an1}so they can build
a case against Donna.

19:47.477 --> 19:48.353
{\an3}You really think
they would do that?

19:48.437 --> 19:52.149
{\an3}I think they'd do
anything at this point.

19:52.232 --> 19:53.775
{\an1}So, guys, we tell them
nothing, okay?

19:53.859 --> 19:54.526
{\an3}That's right, that's
my point exactly.

19:54.610 --> 19:57.029
{\an3}Good, I'm glad
you're all here.

19:58.947 --> 20:00.282
You're all Donna's best friends,

20:00.365 --> 20:02.117
and I know you were all
together Saturday night.

20:02.201 --> 20:02.868
{\an3}I just spoke to
the school board,

20:02.951 --> 20:05.287
{\an3}and I want you all
to know that

20:05.370 --> 20:09.833
the Martins have changed their
mind and requested an appeal.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.168
They have?

20:11.251 --> 20:13.629
{\an3}It's scheduled for
10:00 tomorrow morning.

20:13.712 --> 20:16.298
And I just thought
since you're all so close,

20:16.381 --> 20:18.634
you might want to write some
letters on Donna's behalf.

20:18.717 --> 20:21.762
{\an3}Well, you'll all be taking
finals in the morning,

20:21.845 --> 20:23.472
so you won't be able
to make the hearing,

20:23.555 --> 20:24.640
but if you get the letters
to me,

20:24.723 --> 20:26.975
I'll enter them into the record
for you.

20:30.729 --> 20:31.355
You do want to help her,
don't you?

20:31.438 --> 20:33.398
Of coGood.we do.

20:33.482 --> 20:35.108
I knew Donna could count on you.

20:35.192 --> 20:37.277
{\an3}Now, make sure you get
the letters to me

20:37.361 --> 20:39.529
by 3:00, okay?

20:41.073 --> 20:42.824
I can't believe you thought
Donna ratted on us.

20:42.908 --> 20:43.450
Oh, come off it,
Brenda.

20:43.533 --> 20:45.535
We all did.

20:45.619 --> 20:46.954
You know we all did.

20:47.037 --> 20:48.163
{\an1}Steve's right,
we were all thinking about

20:48.246 --> 20:49.706
{\an1}how we were gonna
save our own hides.

20:49.790 --> 20:52.209
We have to write letters that
are gonna tear their hearts out.

20:52.292 --> 20:53.335
{\an1}Come on, Andrea,
we all know

20:53.418 --> 20:55.545
{\an1}that the letters are
not going to do any good.

20:59.466 --> 21:01.051
{\an5}ANDREA:
<i>"Donna has always</i>
<i>been a leader,</i>

21:01.134 --> 21:03.512
helping students less fortunate
than herself.

21:03.595 --> 21:09.309
{\an3}Oh, Brandon, why does
this sound so...

21:09.393 --> 21:09.601
I don't know, just...

21:09.685 --> 21:12.312
Useless?

21:12.396 --> 21:14.690
Exactly.

21:14.773 --> 21:17.818
{\an3}Brandon, can I talk to you
for a second in the hallway?

21:17.901 --> 21:19.486
Sure.

21:25.951 --> 21:27.911
{\an1}Your instincts
are right, you know.

21:27.995 --> 21:29.121
{\an3}What?

21:29.204 --> 21:30.914
{\an1}Donna's being
railroaded here.

21:30.998 --> 21:33.375
This hearing's nothing
but a kangaroo court.

21:33.458 --> 21:35.377
So what do we do?

21:35.460 --> 21:36.670
No, what do you do.

21:36.753 --> 21:39.381
{\an3}I've been asking myself that
same question all day.

21:39.464 --> 21:42.926
{\an1}Listen, when the Supreme
Court hears a case,

21:43.010 --> 21:44.594
thousands of people
march on Washington

21:44.678 --> 21:45.762
{\an1}in support of whatever
side they're on.

21:45.846 --> 21:49.391
You want to change the world,
start with the school board.

21:49.474 --> 21:50.559
{\an3}You mean we should have
some kind of demonstration?

21:50.642 --> 21:52.561
You figure it out.

21:52.644 --> 21:54.354
{\an1}I've already said enough
to get me fired.

21:54.438 --> 21:56.189
Wait a minute, Gil,

21:56.273 --> 21:58.775
{\an3}West Beverly is the most
apathetic school in America,

21:58.859 --> 22:00.027
and the class of '93

22:00.110 --> 22:01.695
is the most apathetic
class in the school.

22:01.778 --> 22:03.071
{\an3}Nobody's going to
march anywhere,

22:03.155 --> 22:04.698
{\an3}except maybe to a sale
at Fred Segal's.

22:04.781 --> 22:07.159
{\an1}Listen, they would
if they had a leader.

22:07.242 --> 22:08.535
You know, Brandon,

22:08.618 --> 22:11.496
when I first met you,
that's what I thought you were.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.467
Hey, what a nice surprise.

22:23.550 --> 22:25.594
You never visit me in
the middle of the day.

22:25.677 --> 22:28.805
I need to talk to you
about something, Dad.

22:28.889 --> 22:30.057
Is everything okay?

22:30.140 --> 22:30.599
{\an1}Yeah, yeah, yeah,
everything's, uh...

22:30.682 --> 22:32.809
everything's fine.

22:32.893 --> 22:33.477
Okay, what's on your mind?

22:34.519 --> 22:38.315
Well, uh...

22:38.398 --> 22:40.108
remember when you were
in college in the 60s

22:40.192 --> 22:41.985
{\an1}and there were all the Vietnam
War demonstrations?

22:42.069 --> 22:43.153
Yeah.

22:44.404 --> 22:44.905
You went, right?

22:44.988 --> 22:47.616
Oh, sure, everybody did.

22:47.699 --> 22:50.619
{\an3}(chuckling):
Yeah, it was the thing to do.

22:50.702 --> 22:52.996
{\an1}Oh, yeah.?

22:53.080 --> 22:55.457
{\an3}I remember taking a bus down
to Chicago for the moratorium.

22:55.540 --> 22:58.293
{\an3}Must've been over a hundred
thousand people in Grant Park.

22:58.376 --> 23:01.755
Of course, when the cops came
it thinned out a little bit.

23:03.173 --> 23:04.841
Brandon?

23:04.925 --> 23:06.426
What's going on?

23:06.510 --> 23:08.637
Dad, I'm thinking about doing
something that could get me

23:08.720 --> 23:10.806
in a lot of trouble,

23:10.889 --> 23:12.766
{\an1}and I thought maybe
I should tell you about it

23:12.849 --> 23:14.351
What are you planning?

23:14.434 --> 23:16.103
Someone's got to stand up
for Donna, Dad.

23:16.186 --> 23:19.106
(sighs)

23:19.189 --> 23:20.482
Just do me one favor, Brandon...

23:20.565 --> 23:24.236
don't get yourself arrested.

23:29.366 --> 23:30.992
{\an5}ANDREA:
We have finals tomorrow.
We can't do this.

23:31.076 --> 23:31.827
{\an1}BRANDON:
Don't you see?

23:31.910 --> 23:32.869
{\an1}Finals are the key
to this whole thing.

23:32.953 --> 23:36.164
{\an1}We get the entire senior class
to walk out on finals

23:36.248 --> 23:37.999
{\an1}and march on the school board.
Think about it.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.752
{\an1}No one takes finals,
no one graduates.

23:40.836 --> 23:41.503
{\an3}Shh!

23:41.586 --> 23:45.799
What, free Donna
or fail us all?

23:45.882 --> 23:47.717
What do you think?

23:48.593 --> 23:51.805
It could work.

23:53.807 --> 23:56.518
{\an1}So why do you look
so nervous?

23:56.601 --> 23:58.520
{\an3}Because I have a lot
at stake here.

23:58.603 --> 24:01.189
And so do a lot
of other kids.

24:01.273 --> 24:04.109
I mean, who's going to
take that kind of risk?

24:04.192 --> 24:05.277
{\an1}Andrea, we at
least have to try.

24:08.321 --> 24:11.491
{\an3}Brandon, if I don't
take finals tomorrow,

24:11.575 --> 24:12.868
I can't be valedictorian.

24:12.951 --> 24:14.286
Oh, come on, Andrea.

24:14.369 --> 24:15.579
{\an1}You're the one who's always
saying you want

24:15.662 --> 24:17.372
to make a mark around here,

24:17.455 --> 24:19.040
that the class of '93 should be
remembered for something.

24:19.124 --> 24:21.251
{\an1}Do you really want
to be valedictorian of a class

24:21.334 --> 24:22.544
that hasn't done a single
noteworthy thing all year?

24:22.627 --> 24:23.545
No.

24:23.628 --> 24:25.797
We can do this.

24:31.303 --> 24:33.638
No way, I've
come too far.

24:33.722 --> 24:36.057
Look, if I walk
out on finals,

24:36.141 --> 24:38.727
{\an3}forget suspension;
I get expelled.

24:38.810 --> 24:40.812
Not if everybody walks out
with you, Steve.

24:40.896 --> 24:43.565
They're not going to suspend
the entire class of '93.

24:43.648 --> 24:46.234
{\an6}Are you going
to guarantee me
that, Andrea?

24:46.318 --> 24:48.278
Look, I care about
Donna just as much

24:48.361 --> 24:49.404
{\an3}as you guys do,
all right?

24:49.487 --> 24:51.072
{\an3}Normally, I would do
anything for her,

24:51.156 --> 24:54.409
{\an3}but I'm on probation!
I can't!

24:54.492 --> 24:56.578
{\an1}Yesterday, we all thought
that Donna sold us out.

24:56.661 --> 24:58.038
Well, she didn't.

24:58.121 --> 24:59.789
And she'd be the first one
to do this for any of us.

24:59.873 --> 25:03.460
You ready to sell her out?

25:03.543 --> 25:05.086
{\an3}I can't.

25:05.170 --> 25:06.963
{\an3}I'm sorry.

25:07.047 --> 25:08.256
Steve, bro,

25:08.340 --> 25:10.091
{\an1}it's time to lay it
on the line

25:10.175 --> 25:11.384
and not just for Donna,

25:11.468 --> 25:13.428
but because what they're trying
to do here is wrong.

25:13.511 --> 25:15.263
{\an1}Brandon, get in
the real world, man.

25:15.347 --> 25:16.932
{\an1}Nobody is going
to go along with this.

25:17.015 --> 25:18.391
{\an1}So she goes
to summer school.

25:18.475 --> 25:19.226
She'll graduate in August.

25:19.309 --> 25:19.976
{\an1}Nobody's going
to blow their finals

25:20.060 --> 25:23.063
{\an1}so she can wear a cap
and a gown.

25:23.146 --> 25:24.439
{\an1}That's not what this
is about, Dylan!

25:24.522 --> 25:26.733
{\an1}This is about making
a statement, being heard!

25:26.816 --> 25:29.986
It's about trying
to do something,

25:30.070 --> 25:31.154
even if it doesn't work.

25:31.238 --> 25:32.239
{\an1}DYLAN:
What about you?

25:32.322 --> 25:33.323
Silver, what about you?

25:33.406 --> 25:34.824
Are you gonna ditch
the finals and miss your chance

25:34.908 --> 25:36.660
{\an1}at getting out
of this place a year early?

25:36.743 --> 25:39.120
{\an3}Yeah, yeah.
For Donna, I would.

25:39.204 --> 25:40.914
{\an3}So would I.

25:47.045 --> 25:48.463
All right, I'll do it.

25:48.546 --> 25:49.631
Great.

25:49.714 --> 25:50.799
Let's hit the phones.

25:50.882 --> 25:53.426
You guys are crazy.

25:53.510 --> 25:56.179
{\an1}Maybe we are,
but Donna's my best friend.

25:56.263 --> 25:58.598
You heard Brandon-- she would
do that for anybody here.

25:58.682 --> 26:00.308
Kel, don't you understand
where I'm coming from here?

26:00.392 --> 26:01.476
I mean, for the first time
in my life

26:01.559 --> 26:04.312
I finally have some direction,
I know what I want to do.

26:04.396 --> 26:06.356
I got to do good on those exams.
I'm sorry.

26:06.439 --> 26:10.277
I don't think I'm the one
you should be apologizing to.

26:10.360 --> 26:11.820
Where are you going? I thought
you were going to come over.

26:11.903 --> 26:13.863
I've got calls to make now.

26:14.948 --> 26:19.327
That's right. At 10:00
exactly you walk out.

26:19.411 --> 26:20.996
Listen, I'm sure you've heard
about what's happening

26:21.079 --> 26:22.455
to Donna Martin...

26:22.539 --> 26:23.832
All you got to do
is get up from whatever exam

26:23.915 --> 26:25.834
you're taking
and walk out the door...

26:25.917 --> 26:28.837
No, you don't need a note
from your mother...

26:28.920 --> 26:30.338
Everyone's going to be doing it

26:30.422 --> 26:32.173
and you don't want to be left
there sitting alone...

26:32.257 --> 26:32.799
See you tomorrow, cool.
Bye.

26:35.593 --> 26:36.761
(sighs)

26:39.431 --> 26:40.890
Ten out of ten.

26:40.974 --> 26:43.018
Yeah, me, too. I just finished
up the last call.

26:43.101 --> 26:44.686
I never realized how much people
care about Donna.

26:44.769 --> 26:47.188
I mean, you should have heard
everybody.

26:47.272 --> 26:48.398
I know.

26:48.481 --> 26:50.108
Everybody felt so guilty,
like it could have happened

26:50.191 --> 26:51.067
to any one of them.

26:51.151 --> 26:53.028
That what's they kept saying,
over and over.

26:53.111 --> 26:54.654
Do you think it's gonna work?

26:54.738 --> 26:56.031
I hope so.

26:56.114 --> 26:57.991
Otherwise, we just talked
a lot of people

26:58.074 --> 26:59.075
into throwing away their high
school careers for nothing.

27:10.462 --> 27:12.922
{\an5}STEVE:
You know,
I'm beginning to wonder.

27:13.006 --> 27:15.884
Maybe Dylan was right.
Maybe this is a mistake.

27:15.967 --> 27:16.968
Just forget about Dylan.

27:17.052 --> 27:18.428
He's on his own trip.

27:18.511 --> 27:19.888
Steve, we've been over this
a hundred times.

27:19.971 --> 27:20.847
I know, I know. I'm just
a little nervous, okay?

27:20.930 --> 27:23.725
{\an3}Listen, guys, I told
Donna what's going down.

27:23.808 --> 27:26.603
{\an3}She said to say
she loves you all.

27:26.686 --> 27:27.729
{\an1}Let's just hope
for her sake that this works.

27:27.812 --> 27:29.731
I know this is going to sound
kind of stupid,

27:29.814 --> 27:30.732
but shouldn't we, like,

27:30.815 --> 27:32.776
synchronize our watches
or something?

27:32.859 --> 27:35.487
{\an3}No, we should go by
the classroom clocks.

27:35.570 --> 27:36.613
10:00 a.m. we walk.

27:36.696 --> 27:37.906
Okay.

27:37.989 --> 27:38.740
{\an1}Well, in a few hours
from now, we'll either

27:38.823 --> 27:43.203
{\an1}all be heroes...
or big-time losers.

27:44.704 --> 27:46.623
{\an3}So, Walsh,

27:46.706 --> 27:48.708
{\an3}looks like the rooster's
come home to crow.

27:48.792 --> 27:49.834
Where'd you learn that, Tobi,
<i>The Farmer's Almanac?</i>

27:51.002 --> 27:52.879
(laughs)

27:52.962 --> 27:53.880
{\an3}Last week when our
dress code came down

27:53.963 --> 27:56.132
and it didn't affect you,

27:56.216 --> 27:58.426
{\an3}you didn't give a damn what
happened at this school.

27:58.510 --> 28:01.471
{\an3}Now we hear through
the grapevine

28:01.554 --> 28:02.389
{\an3}that there's some
massive senior mobilization

28:02.472 --> 28:03.390
to save Donna Martin.

28:03.473 --> 28:04.808
Well, you heard right.

28:04.891 --> 28:06.810
{\an1}Well, we just wanted
to, uh, say...

28:06.893 --> 28:09.437
we're with you.

28:09.521 --> 28:10.939
Thanks.

28:11.022 --> 28:13.316
And we talked to
a lot of juniors.

28:13.400 --> 28:15.443
If you can somehow add
dumping the dress code

28:15.527 --> 28:16.486
to your list of demands,

28:16.569 --> 28:19.114
{\an3}you've got 300 more
kids walking with you.

28:19.197 --> 28:20.532
What do you say, guys?

28:20.615 --> 28:21.950
{\an3}I never really liked
dress codes.

28:22.033 --> 28:24.285
{\an1}I say
stick it to 'em.

28:24.369 --> 28:24.869
AAll right!

28:26.871 --> 28:29.124
All right then.

28:35.547 --> 28:36.840
Oh, Jackie!

28:36.923 --> 28:38.633
{\an1}Oh, I'm so glad
you're here.

28:38.716 --> 28:41.010
{\an3}Well, someone had to show
up to speak for Donna.

28:41.094 --> 28:42.470
Hopefully, we can make
a difference.

28:42.554 --> 28:43.471
{\an3}Yeah.

28:43.555 --> 28:44.681
Felice?

28:44.764 --> 28:47.142
{\an3}Hi, Donna.

28:47.225 --> 28:48.143
Hi, Dr. Silver.

28:48.226 --> 28:49.144
How're you holding up?

28:49.227 --> 28:50.311
Okay, I guess.

28:50.395 --> 28:51.396
Good.

28:51.479 --> 28:55.108
Felice, I'm going to testify
on Donna's behalf today,

28:55.191 --> 28:56.985
and I just want to say I think
you made the right decision.

28:57.068 --> 29:00.321
I'm so glad you think so.

29:00.405 --> 29:02.657
We just wanted to wish you
all good luck.

29:02.740 --> 29:04.159
{\an3}Thank you.

29:04.242 --> 29:06.536
Well, to tell you the truth,
at first I was against this.

29:06.619 --> 29:07.662
{\an3}JACKIE:
You know, Felice,

29:07.745 --> 29:09.998
I've thought
an awful lot about this.

29:10.081 --> 29:12.125
You know I've had my own share
of problems

29:12.208 --> 29:13.168
with drugs and alcohol,

29:13.251 --> 29:14.502
{\an3}and if I really
believed

29:14.586 --> 29:16.087
that making an example of Donna

29:16.171 --> 29:19.716
would convince even one kid
not to drink too much,

29:19.799 --> 29:21.509
{\an3}I would be leading
the fight against her,

29:21.593 --> 29:23.136
{\an1}but you can't scare people
into sobriety.

29:23.219 --> 29:26.306
It doesn't work for kids
and it doesn't work for adults.

29:26.389 --> 29:29.017
Well, right now,

29:29.100 --> 29:32.187
all I want is to see
my daughter graduate.

29:33.980 --> 29:35.023
{\an5}MEYERS:
<i>Finals will commence</i>
<i>at 10:00 sharp.</i>

29:35.106 --> 29:39.319
<i>Please place all your books</i>
<i>under your seats.</i>

29:39.402 --> 29:41.029
<i>All you will need</i>
<i>are two sharp pencils.</i>

29:41.112 --> 29:43.323
<i>If you finish early,</i>

29:43.406 --> 29:45.909
<i>you may turn in your test</i>
<i>booklet and leave the room.</i>

29:45.992 --> 29:49.037
<i>When the 10:00 bell rings,</i>
<i>pick up your pencil</i>

29:49.120 --> 29:50.163
<i>and begin your exam.</i>

29:50.246 --> 29:53.500
<i>When the bell rings</i>
<i>for the end of the period,</i>

29:53.583 --> 29:56.377
<i>put down your pencils</i>
<i>and close your blue books.</i>

29:56.461 --> 30:00.507
And if I catch anyone's eyes
wandering, I can assure you

30:00.590 --> 30:02.800
that you'll be taking
the same test next year.

30:13.853 --> 30:15.104
(bell rings)

30:19.317 --> 30:20.401
What's going on?

30:20.485 --> 30:21.069
We're walking out.

30:37.710 --> 30:39.045
What the hell is this?

30:39.128 --> 30:40.129
It's a march.

30:40.213 --> 30:41.881
{\an1}Donna Martin graduates
or none of us do.

30:41.965 --> 30:44.133
Want to come?

30:48.346 --> 30:50.223
Well, you know what they say.

30:50.306 --> 30:51.391
If you can't beat 'em...

30:51.474 --> 30:54.477
Go on, everybody else has.

30:54.561 --> 30:56.771
I figure if I'm going to be
going to Berkeley,

30:56.854 --> 30:58.940
I'm going to have to learn
to do this thing anyway.

30:59.023 --> 31:01.401
(laughs)

31:01.484 --> 31:05.280
{\an5}(chanting):
Donna Martin graduates!
Donna Martin graduates!

31:05.363 --> 31:06.990
Donna Martin graduates!
Donna Martin graduates!

31:07.073 --> 31:08.116
Donna Martin graduates!

31:08.199 --> 31:11.452
{\an3}Yo, good to see
you're with us, my man.

31:11.536 --> 31:12.453
{\an1}A little peer pressure
every time.

31:12.537 --> 31:14.998
Donna Martin graduates!
Donna Martin graduates!

31:15.081 --> 31:16.332
{\an3}Maybe I was
wrong, Brandon.

31:16.416 --> 31:17.834
Maybe the class of '93

31:17.917 --> 31:19.961
has life left in
it after all.

31:20.044 --> 31:23.298
Donna Martin graduates!
Donna Martin graduates!

31:23.381 --> 31:25.300
(gavel raps)

31:25.383 --> 31:28.303
{\an1}This meeting
will come to order.

31:28.386 --> 31:30.805
Let the record show that all
board members are present,

31:30.888 --> 31:31.973
including Melanie Silverman,

31:32.056 --> 31:34.809
who cut her vacation short
to be here.

31:34.892 --> 31:36.311
This hearing was called
at the request

31:36.394 --> 31:37.979
of Dr. and Mrs. John Martin

31:38.062 --> 31:40.189
to appeal a decision
of the disciplinary committee

31:40.273 --> 31:41.816
in regards to their daughter,

31:41.899 --> 31:43.943
West Beverly senior
Donna Martin.

31:44.027 --> 31:45.820
The committee voted
to suspend Miss Martin

31:45.903 --> 31:48.323
and revoke all senior
privileges, including graduation

31:48.406 --> 31:50.366
after she was found
to be intoxicated

31:50.450 --> 31:52.327
at the West Beverly senior prom.

31:52.410 --> 31:53.453
There will be an opportunity

31:53.536 --> 31:57.290
to hear from character witnesses
in Miss Martin's behalf.

31:57.373 --> 31:59.542
Also, it should be noted
for the record

31:59.626 --> 32:02.128
that we have received several
dozens of letters

32:02.211 --> 32:05.840
in support of Miss Martin.

32:05.923 --> 32:09.218
Right now, I think
we'd like to talk

32:09.302 --> 32:11.262
to the young woman herself.

32:11.346 --> 32:13.056
Miss Martin,

32:13.139 --> 32:15.141
{\an3}will you step
forward, please?

32:19.103 --> 32:20.355
{\an3}I love you,
sweetheart.

32:22.565 --> 32:23.566
I'm scared.

32:23.650 --> 32:24.692
{\an3}I know.

32:24.776 --> 32:26.361
It'll be okay.

32:26.444 --> 32:28.029
Just tell the truth.

32:28.112 --> 32:29.113
{\an1}Okay.

32:38.414 --> 32:41.542
{\an3}Donna, before we talk
to your parents

32:41.626 --> 32:43.586
{\an3}or hear from
the others here,

32:43.670 --> 32:45.171
I'd like you to tell me why

32:45.254 --> 32:47.048
{\an1}you think this board
should consider

32:47.131 --> 32:49.384
overturning
the decision

32:49.467 --> 32:50.843
{\an3}of the disciplinary
committee.

32:50.927 --> 32:56.599
Because... I'm sorry
for what I did.

32:56.683 --> 33:01.521
I'm sorry I got drunk,

33:01.604 --> 33:05.191
but all I was doing
was celebrating with my friends

33:05.274 --> 33:08.236
on prom night.

33:08.319 --> 33:15.201
And Dr. Silver, well,
he made a toast to us,

33:15.284 --> 33:18.371
and it was really nice.

33:18.454 --> 33:25.086
And I didn't think there was
anything wrong with it.

33:25.169 --> 33:30.800
I loved being in high school.

33:30.883 --> 33:35.930
I love West Beverly.

33:36.013 --> 33:43.396
And I would love more than
anything in this whole world,

33:43.479 --> 33:49.277
to be able to walk up there
and get my diploma

33:49.360 --> 33:51.320
with the rest of my class.

33:53.656 --> 33:55.742
With my friends.

33:58.411 --> 34:03.458
Please, please, believe me.

34:03.541 --> 34:06.461
I didn't plan to get drunk.

34:06.544 --> 34:08.838
(wild shouting outside)

34:08.920 --> 34:11.047
I'm sorry.

34:12.341 --> 34:15.261
Donna Martin graduates!
Donna Martin graduates!

34:15.344 --> 34:17.263
Donna Martin graduates!
Donna Martin graduates!

34:17.346 --> 34:20.183
What's that?

34:20.266 --> 34:21.309
Sounds like a revolution.

34:23.268 --> 34:26.147
Donna Martin graduates!
Donna Martin graduates!

34:26.230 --> 34:27.982
Donna Martin graduates!

34:28.065 --> 34:31.360
Donna Martin graduates!
Donna Martin graduates!

34:31.444 --> 34:34.781
Donna Martin graduates!
Donna Martin graduates!

34:34.864 --> 34:36.157
{\an1}This is bigger
than I ever imagined.

34:36.239 --> 34:37.867
Look at all these people.

34:37.949 --> 34:39.368
{\an3}Yeah, well,
it's not over yet.

34:39.452 --> 34:42.163
{\an1}What if they call
the police, Brandon?

34:42.246 --> 34:43.873
{\an3}We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

34:43.956 --> 34:46.167
Donna Martin graduates!
Donna Martin graduates!

34:46.250 --> 34:47.960
I think we have a problem.

34:48.043 --> 34:48.960
What's going on?

34:49.045 --> 34:51.005
There's a mob outside.

34:51.088 --> 34:52.005
{\an3}What?!

34:52.089 --> 34:55.967
{\an3}Send someone outside
to find out what on earth

34:56.052 --> 34:57.094
is goinOkay.

35:00.097 --> 35:03.059
(chanting continues)

35:07.355 --> 35:10.650
Donna Martin graduates!
Donna Martin graduates!

35:10.733 --> 35:12.401
Donna Martin graduates!

35:12.485 --> 35:15.655
Donna Martin graduates!
Donna Martin graduates!

35:15.738 --> 35:17.365
Donna Martin graduates!

35:17.448 --> 35:20.701
Donna Martin graduates!
Donna Martin graduates!

35:20.785 --> 35:21.786
(chanting continues)

35:33.631 --> 35:35.258
Donna Martin graduates!
Donna Martin graduates!

35:35.341 --> 35:37.426
Mrs. Teasley, am I correct

35:37.510 --> 35:40.221
{\an1}in assuming that the students
outside this building

35:40.304 --> 35:43.057
{\an1}should be taking
Yes, sir.als right now?

35:43.140 --> 35:44.392
{\an3}ANDREA:
Excuse me.

35:44.475 --> 35:47.270
Superintendent Ephardt?

35:51.023 --> 35:54.402
Um... some of us thought
that we should come down here

35:54.485 --> 35:55.486
{\an3}and stand
by our friend.

35:55.570 --> 35:58.531
{\an3}Did you know
anything about this?

35:58.614 --> 35:59.323
No.

35:59.407 --> 36:03.244
Very well, Miss Zuckerman.
Proceed.

36:03.327 --> 36:06.247
I have a statement
that I would like to read.

36:06.330 --> 36:08.082
"Recent actions

36:08.165 --> 36:10.418
"of the school board have
prompted strong reactions

36:10.501 --> 36:12.253
"on the part of the students

36:12.336 --> 36:14.297
{\an3}"at West Beverly
High School.

36:14.380 --> 36:18.050
{\an3}"The junior and
senior class refuse

36:18.134 --> 36:19.427
"to take finals
unless Donna Martin graduates.

36:23.347 --> 36:25.391
Suspend Donna, suspend us all."

36:27.894 --> 36:29.270
That's nonsense.

36:29.353 --> 36:31.939
There are a lot
of angry people out there.

36:32.023 --> 36:33.024
You can't just ignore them.

36:33.107 --> 36:36.944
I allowed you to speak today
as a character witness,

36:37.028 --> 36:38.279
Miss Zuckerman.

36:38.362 --> 36:40.281
{\an1}Your threats do nothing
to enhance

36:40.364 --> 36:43.326
my perception of Miss Martin's
character or of yours.

36:44.577 --> 36:46.454
{\an1}I'm going to call
a recess here.

36:46.537 --> 36:49.248
We'll return in 30 minutes,
by which time

36:49.332 --> 36:51.500
I expect to have the situation
outside under control.

36:57.548 --> 37:01.135
Donna Martin graduates!
Donna Martin graduates!

37:01.219 --> 37:03.804
Stop this! Do you hear me?
Stop this!

37:03.888 --> 37:06.140
What do you all think
you're doing here?

37:06.223 --> 37:07.433
Do you think
you're helping anyone?

37:07.516 --> 37:10.978
{\an6}We're all here to
show our support for
Donna, Mrs. Martin.

37:11.062 --> 37:13.314
She has spent
the entire morning in there

37:13.397 --> 37:14.607
apologizing to the board.

37:14.690 --> 37:17.151
This little demonstration,
you can be sure,

37:17.234 --> 37:18.736
has just thrown all that
out the window!

37:18.819 --> 37:21.197
Yeah, well, we all thought
we needed to be here.

37:21.280 --> 37:23.491
You all are the <i> last</i> thing
I need here right now.

37:23.574 --> 37:26.285
Do you honestly think
that anyone in there

37:26.369 --> 37:27.495
{\an1}is going to respond
to your threats?

37:27.578 --> 37:32.041
Donna Martin graduates!
Donna Martin graduates!

37:32.124 --> 37:38.506
(chanting continues)

37:38.589 --> 37:41.092
{\an5}EPHARDT:
I'm calling the Beverly Hills
Police Department.

37:41.175 --> 37:43.010
{\an6}SILVERMAN:
I think you're taking
this too far, George.

37:43.094 --> 37:44.345
{\an3}Give the kid a
slap on the wrist

37:44.428 --> 37:45.513
and everyone goes home.

37:45.596 --> 37:47.223
{\an3}Mr. Ephardt,
for the record,

37:47.306 --> 37:49.308
Donna Martin has never been
a problem at West Beverly.

37:49.392 --> 37:51.519
{\an3}In fact, this is a kid who
overcame a learning disability

37:51.602 --> 37:53.187
and against all odds climbed
her way

37:53.270 --> 37:54.313
to the top half of her class.

37:54.397 --> 37:55.356
I hate to see this happening
to her.

37:55.439 --> 37:56.440
It could really hurt.

37:56.524 --> 37:58.567
{\an1}The no-drinking rule
was passed unanimously

37:58.651 --> 37:59.652
by this board.

37:59.735 --> 38:00.611
What kind of a message
do you think it sends

38:00.695 --> 38:05.032
{\an1}when the first student
that breaks it gets off?

38:05.116 --> 38:07.201
I wasn't here
when you passed that motion,

38:07.284 --> 38:10.329
but did any of you consider
the students' reactions?

38:10.413 --> 38:12.540
{\an1}Oh, so now the students
control the school board?

38:12.623 --> 38:13.541
I don't think so.

38:13.624 --> 38:15.418
What do they think this is,
the Vietnam War?

38:15.501 --> 38:19.213
{\an1}Well, I am not caving in
to a bunch of hippie wannabes.

38:19.297 --> 38:21.424
With all due respect, sir, there
are over 500 students out there.

38:21.507 --> 38:23.426
I don't care how many
there are out there.

38:23.509 --> 38:26.554
{\an1}We'll call parents,
we'll notify colleges.

38:26.637 --> 38:27.513
Recommendations
will be revoked.

38:27.596 --> 38:30.266
You can't do that.

38:30.349 --> 38:30.975
Watch me.

38:32.518 --> 38:35.229
ALL:
Donna Martin graduates!

38:35.312 --> 38:35.813
Donna Martin
graduates!

38:35.896 --> 38:38.482
Donna Martin graduates!

38:38.566 --> 38:40.776
Brandon, Brandon.

38:40.860 --> 38:42.903
I assume you had something
to do with this.

38:42.987 --> 38:44.405
Yeah.

38:44.488 --> 38:49.243
Well, Superintendent Ephardt
has a message for you.

38:49.326 --> 38:50.953
Hey, hey, hey, everybody!

38:51.037 --> 38:52.288
Everybody shut up!

38:52.371 --> 38:53.539
Shut up!

38:53.622 --> 38:55.541
Thank you.

38:57.543 --> 39:01.047
What's it say?

39:01.130 --> 39:04.300
It says if we drop
the whole thing right now,

39:04.383 --> 39:06.302
they won't go ahead
and flunk all of us.

39:06.385 --> 39:07.678
Can they do that?

39:07.762 --> 39:12.933
{\an3}Listen, I know how important
Donna Martin is to all of you,

39:13.017 --> 39:15.519
{\an1}but Superintendent Ephardt
is serious about this,

39:15.603 --> 39:16.979
{\an3}and I'd hate to
see you throw

39:17.063 --> 39:18.314
{\an3}your entire high
school careers

39:18.397 --> 39:19.440
{\an3}down the drain
for this.

39:20.524 --> 39:22.610
Tell Superintendent Ephardt

39:22.693 --> 39:23.569
{\an3}that, uh, summer school
registration is going

39:23.652 --> 39:25.446
{\an3}to break the
record this year.

39:25.529 --> 39:27.406
{\an3}STEVE:
Donna Martin graduates.

39:28.532 --> 39:32.078
Donna Martin graduates.

39:32.161 --> 39:34.288
{\an3}Donna Martin
graduates.

39:34.371 --> 39:36.082
ALL:
Donna Martin graduates!

39:36.165 --> 39:36.665
Donna Martin
graduates!

39:36.749 --> 39:39.001
Donna Martin graduates!

39:39.085 --> 39:40.461
Donna Martin
graduates!

39:40.544 --> 39:42.838
{\an1}Brandon, maybe this
<i>has</i> gone too far.

39:42.922 --> 39:44.632
{\an1}Maybe you should just
tell everybody to go home.

39:44.715 --> 39:47.134
{\an3}Dad, come on, you
sound like Spiro Agnew.

39:47.218 --> 39:49.095
Everybody, come on,
we're going in!

39:49.178 --> 39:51.514
(cheering loudly)

39:52.723 --> 39:55.851
Donna Martin graduates!

39:55.935 --> 39:56.644
Donna Martin
graduates!

39:56.727 --> 39:59.188
Donna Martin graduates!

39:59.271 --> 40:01.482
Donna Martin graduates!
Donna Martin graduates!

40:01.565 --> 40:03.984
Donna Martin
graduates!

40:04.068 --> 40:04.985
Donna Martin graduates!

40:05.069 --> 40:09.198
Donna Martin graduates!
Donna Martin graduates!

40:09.281 --> 40:10.783
Donna Martin
graduates!

40:10.866 --> 40:11.992
Donna Martin graduates!

40:12.076 --> 40:14.537
Donna Martin graduates!
Donna Martin graduates!

40:14.620 --> 40:15.496
Donna Martin
graduates!

40:15.579 --> 40:17.665
{\an1}Donna Martin
graduates!

40:17.748 --> 40:20.251
This meeting
will come to order.

40:20.334 --> 40:20.709
Donna Martin graduates!

40:20.793 --> 40:23.462
(gavel banging)

40:23.546 --> 40:26.882
This meeting will come back
to order.

40:26.966 --> 40:28.467
Donna Martin graduates!

40:28.551 --> 40:29.093
Donna Martin
graduates!

40:30.761 --> 40:33.681
Superintendent Ephardt.

40:33.764 --> 40:36.725
You're out of order,
Mr. Walsh.

40:36.809 --> 40:38.561
{\an6}I think we've gone
a little beyond Robert's
Rules at this point, George.

40:38.644 --> 40:40.688
{\an3}I'd like to hear what
Brandon has to say.

40:40.771 --> 40:44.024
(bystaThank you.eing)

40:44.108 --> 40:46.360
{\an3}Now, the students have
taken your "threats"

40:46.443 --> 40:49.363
{\an1}very seriously,
Superintendent Ephardt,

40:49.446 --> 40:51.323
{\an1}but I think you can judge
by their reaction

40:51.407 --> 40:52.867
{\an1}that no one's going
anywhere,

40:52.950 --> 40:53.534
{\an1}so unless you're prepared
to call the police

40:53.617 --> 40:56.203
to make us all go home,

40:56.287 --> 40:58.205
{\an3}I think you ought to
take what we're saying

40:58.289 --> 40:59.206
{\an3}a little more
seriously.

40:59.290 --> 41:01.375
{\an1}GIRL:
Yeah.

41:01.458 --> 41:04.712
{\an3}Now we're all here because
we believe in something.

41:04.795 --> 41:06.547
{\an3}You all would have
been very happy

41:06.630 --> 41:08.549
if you hadn't
caught someone

41:08.632 --> 41:11.051
{\an3}with an unblemished
school record,

41:11.135 --> 41:11.719
someone that you could
have very easily made

41:11.802 --> 41:13.596
an example out of.

41:13.679 --> 41:18.392
{\an3}That's what this rule
was all about, wasn't it?

41:18.475 --> 41:22.396
{\an3}However, ladies and gentlemen,
you caught the wrong person.

41:22.480 --> 41:25.024
You caught someone that doesn't
deserve to be treated like this.

41:25.107 --> 41:26.358
You caught our friend,

41:26.442 --> 41:27.568
Donna Martin.

41:27.651 --> 41:30.404
{\an3}Donna Martin is the
kind of girl that goes

41:30.487 --> 41:31.697
{\an1}out of her way
for people.

41:31.780 --> 41:33.407
{\an1}That's why all these people
here are going

41:33.490 --> 41:34.700
{\an1}out of their way
for her.

41:35.659 --> 41:38.245
We love Donna,

41:38.329 --> 41:40.122
{\an3}and we're not going
to see her hurt.

41:40.206 --> 41:41.373
(people applauding)

41:41.457 --> 41:43.500
Right on.

41:48.464 --> 41:50.466
{\an1}Thank you,
Mr. Walsh.

41:50.549 --> 41:52.718
(girl clears throat)

41:52.801 --> 41:54.345
Oh, one more thing.

41:54.428 --> 41:55.095
I don't think
you're going

41:55.179 --> 41:57.389
{\an1}to have much success
matriculating

41:57.473 --> 41:59.141
the juniors unless, uh,

41:59.225 --> 42:00.726
{\an1}you drop this whole
dress code thing.

42:00.809 --> 42:02.394
(people cheering)

42:03.520 --> 42:06.941
We'll take that
under advisement.

42:07.024 --> 42:07.942
Any questions?

42:08.025 --> 42:09.276
{\an3}Yeah.

42:09.360 --> 42:13.447
{\an3}I'd just like to say that
I, for one, am not prepared

42:13.530 --> 42:16.116
{\an3}to call the
police here today.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.577
{\an3}Therefore, I move we vote
to allow Donna Martin

42:18.661 --> 42:20.663
to graduate, provided
she enroll in a drug

42:20.746 --> 42:24.625
{\an3}and alcohol counseling
program at the Maple Center.

42:24.708 --> 42:26.585
Second.

42:26.669 --> 42:29.421
{\an3}I also suggest that we review
the dress code situation,

42:29.505 --> 42:30.464
{\an3}or we're going to
have a demonstration

42:30.547 --> 42:32.967
like this the first week
of school in September.

42:33.050 --> 42:34.510
That's right.

42:36.887 --> 42:39.807
Very well.

42:39.890 --> 42:43.811
{\an3}An aye vote signifies
Miss Martin will graduate.

42:43.894 --> 42:47.481
{\an3}A nay vote signifies
the decision

42:47.564 --> 42:48.983
{\an3}of the disciplinary
committee

42:49.066 --> 42:50.484
will stand.

42:51.777 --> 42:52.695
Mr. Chang.

42:52.778 --> 42:53.988
{\an1}Nay.

42:54.071 --> 42:55.322
{\an3}EPHARDT:
Mrs. Richter.

42:55.406 --> 42:56.073
Aye.

42:59.243 --> 43:00.327
Ms. Silverman?

43:00.411 --> 43:01.578
Aye.

43:03.163 --> 43:04.999
Mr. Pula?

43:05.082 --> 43:06.125
{\an3}Nay.

43:08.085 --> 43:12.423
{\an1}Mrs. Lufrano
for the final deciding vote.

43:18.095 --> 43:18.679
Aye.

43:18.762 --> 43:20.306
(cheering)

43:23.434 --> 43:26.395
{\an3}Thank God.

43:26.478 --> 43:26.812
Congratulations.

43:29.815 --> 43:31.734
(sighs)

43:31.817 --> 43:33.986
Congratulations.

43:34.069 --> 43:35.571
STEVE:
All right, I got a great idea.

43:35.654 --> 43:37.197
Let's all get drunk.

43:37.281 --> 43:40.367
(cheering)

43:40.451 --> 43:42.870
Steven,
I know I didn't hear that.

43:42.953 --> 43:44.580
Okay, everybody, fun's over.

43:44.663 --> 43:45.581
Let's go back to school.

43:45.664 --> 43:47.708
Afternoon finals will proceed
as scheduled.

43:47.791 --> 43:50.753
(all groaning)

43:50.836 --> 43:52.087
You, too, Donna.

43:52.171 --> 43:53.881
You know, Mrs. T.,
I have never been so happy

43:53.964 --> 43:55.883
to take a final
in my entire life.

44:00.804 --> 44:04.808
Congratulations, my sweetheart,
and welcome back.

44:04.892 --> 44:05.893
And in honor of Donna,

44:05.976 --> 44:09.605
a piece of pie of your choice
is on you know who.

44:09.688 --> 44:10.606
(laughs)

44:10.689 --> 44:12.900
Thank you, Nat.

44:12.983 --> 44:13.942

The man of the hour.

44:14.026 --> 44:16.779
{\an1}Hail to the
conquering hero.

44:16.862 --> 44:19.281
Donna, I, uh,
I got a little present for you.

44:19.365 --> 44:21.408
Just open it.

44:21.492 --> 44:23.077
{\an1}It's something you worked
long and hard for.

44:23.160 --> 44:24.453
