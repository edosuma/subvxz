WEBVTT

00:17.741 --> 00:19.226
Johnny.

00:19.260 --> 00:20.951
You're still afraid.

00:20.986 --> 00:22.574
- Stop it, now. I mean it

00:27.061 --> 00:30.375
- They're coming to
get you, Barbara.

00:30.409 --> 00:32.929
- Stop it. You're ignorant.

00:32.963 --> 00:35.621
- They're coming
for you, Barbara.

00:35.656 --> 00:38.555
- Stop it. You're
acting like a child.

00:38.590 --> 00:39.763
- They're coming for you.

00:40.937 --> 00:43.181
- Look, there comes
one of them now.

00:43.215 --> 00:44.423
- He'll hear you.

00:44.458 --> 00:46.425
- Here he comes now.
I'm getting out of here.

00:46.460 --> 00:47.460
- Johnny.

00:59.852 --> 01:02.062
Johnny, help me!

03:21.373 --> 03:22.892
- Dude. Where'd you get that?

03:22.926 --> 03:26.551
- I got it off this guy
wearing a Lucha Libre mask.

03:26.585 --> 03:27.585
- What?

03:44.672 --> 03:45.672
- Whoa.

03:47.296 --> 03:48.504
- You all good?

03:50.782 --> 03:52.128
- Oh, that's you.

04:57.918 --> 04:59.333
Morning.

06:53.827 --> 06:56.623
- Hey asshole!
Learn how to drive!

07:16.056 --> 07:19.162
- Cellular solutions. Cellular
Solutions, this is Alex.

07:19.197 --> 07:21.924
Cellular Solutions,
this is Alex.

07:21.958 --> 07:23.581
No, we can't send
you a new phone,

07:23.615 --> 07:26.860
but for only $9.99 a month,
I can offer you the extended-

07:26.894 --> 07:29.069
Cellular Solutions,
this is Alex.

07:29.103 --> 07:31.219
No, I didn't say you dropped
your phone in the toilet,

07:31.243 --> 07:33.073
but sometimes that's
a possibility.

07:34.419 --> 07:37.595
Well, no, my
manager's currently unavailable

07:37.629 --> 07:38.906
to assist you at this moment.

07:38.941 --> 07:41.046
So, I guess you're
fucking stuck with me.

07:42.496 --> 07:45.050
I said, I guess you're
fucking stuck with me, Dicky.

07:46.983 --> 07:48.744
- What up, bitches?

07:48.778 --> 07:50.021
- What the fuck?

07:50.055 --> 07:52.920
- What?
- You're late, again.

07:52.955 --> 07:54.404
- Why does it matter?

07:54.439 --> 07:55.647
Nobody's here.

07:55.682 --> 07:56.924
We still have shit to do.

07:56.959 --> 07:58.512
- Relax, Vince, too
much stress results

07:58.547 --> 08:02.033
in premature bald-ation.
- Bald-ation isn't a word.

08:02.067 --> 08:03.275
- Put these on the rack.

08:04.898 --> 08:07.314
- Whatever you
say, Mr. Boss-man.

08:12.940 --> 08:15.667
- Oh my God. Look at
her. She's high as fuck.

08:15.702 --> 08:16.806
- You're one to talk.

08:16.841 --> 08:18.774
- Are you fucking kidding me?

08:18.808 --> 08:20.879
- What?
- How stupid do you think I am

08:20.914 --> 08:23.295
- Dude, you're making a
big deal out of nothing.

08:24.365 --> 08:26.609
- October, just go home.

08:30.682 --> 08:31.959
- What, are you firing me?

08:34.168 --> 08:35.583
Man, fuck this!

08:35.618 --> 08:37.688
I don't need your
stupid fucking job.

08:37.724 --> 08:39.691
Stupid fucking unicorn shirt.

08:39.726 --> 08:41.969
This place fucking sucks anyway

09:08.858 --> 09:10.308
- What?

09:16.832 --> 09:18.937
- My kid was up all night,
puking his guts out.

09:18.972 --> 09:20.536
I've got to get some
caffeine in my system

09:20.560 --> 09:21.768
or I won't make it to lunch.

09:21.802 --> 09:23.770
- Hey, could you
back fuck the up?

09:25.185 --> 09:26.358
- What?

09:26.393 --> 09:29.741
- I can feel you
breathing on my neck

09:29.776 --> 09:31.398
and it is really
grossing me out.

09:32.606 --> 09:34.574
So, will you just give
me some space, please?

09:38.060 --> 09:39.060
- Sorry.

10:02.809 --> 10:03.809
- Be still.

10:04.776 --> 10:06.398
- Such an artistic genius.

10:06.433 --> 10:08.331
- What's that? Quiet.

10:08.366 --> 10:09.643
- Get some smoke in there.

10:11.645 --> 10:12.715
- Dude, what up, guys?

10:13.889 --> 10:15.338
This is so gonna
go in my portfolio.

10:15.373 --> 10:17.133
- I don't know about that.

10:17.168 --> 10:18.238
Get my feet in there.

10:18.272 --> 10:19.929
- Okay.
- They like feet.

10:19.964 --> 10:21.379
- What the hell
are you guys doing?

10:21.413 --> 10:24.244
- I've been selling my
dirty panties online.

10:24.278 --> 10:25.072
- What?

10:25.107 --> 10:26.487
- Yeah.
- Why?

10:26.522 --> 10:28.731
- Because rich business
jerks pay top dollar

10:28.766 --> 10:30.250
for used panties.

10:30.284 --> 10:31.251
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

10:31.285 --> 10:33.529
- You guys are sick.

10:33.563 --> 10:35.876
- It's better than selling
overpriced t-shirts

10:35.911 --> 10:37.464
to hipsters for minimum wage.

10:38.707 --> 10:39.891
- I like that underwear
though, it's cute.

10:39.915 --> 10:41.433
- Thanks Targe.

10:42.814 --> 10:44.574
- Dude, you guys.

10:44.609 --> 10:47.094
There's somebody on here
asking for someone to kill him.

10:47.129 --> 10:48.302
- Wait, like an assassin?

10:49.200 --> 10:51.616
- I don't know. I guess.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.860
- Man, there's a lot of fucked
up people in this world.

10:53.894 --> 10:55.447
- Yeah.

10:55.482 --> 10:57.522
- This guy's probably the
saddest dude in the world.

11:03.524 --> 11:06.493
- Wait, are you seriously
responding to that guy?

11:06.527 --> 11:07.712
- Yeah. Aren't you a
little bit curious to know

11:07.736 --> 11:09.461
who would post
something like that?

11:10.670 --> 11:11.809
- You're disgusting.

11:13.155 --> 11:15.467
- I'm disgusting? Okay.

11:19.126 --> 11:21.508
Hey, dude. Do you
mind if I take a bump?

11:50.882 --> 11:52.159
- Yeah, I like it.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.711
- Hey, you're looking kind
of down. How about a joke?

13:59.735 --> 14:01.841
Why don't Italians like
Jehovah's Witnesses.

14:02.772 --> 14:03.946
- I don't know.

14:03.981 --> 14:05.672
- They don't like any
fucking witnesses.

14:37.255 --> 14:38.636
- Hey, thank you.

14:39.568 --> 14:40.845
- Thanks a lot.

14:58.794 --> 15:02.556
All right, you got it, man.

15:06.043 --> 15:09.598
Oh-ho! A
little help, old man.

15:19.539 --> 15:21.092
Can I join you boys?

15:21.127 --> 15:23.439
Yeah. Go ahead.

15:26.132 --> 15:27.996
That was a nice shot, Grandpa.

15:28.030 --> 15:28.928
Hey, this guy's

15:28.962 --> 15:30.653
a fucking beast over here, man.

15:36.004 --> 15:39.317
There you go, you're out!

15:47.981 --> 15:49.949
- Ow, you fucking bitch!

16:27.434 --> 16:29.022
- Come on, get in the pool.

16:29.057 --> 16:30.472
- Get in the pool.
- Come on.

16:30.506 --> 16:31.749
- I can't get wet.

16:31.783 --> 16:33.682
- Stephanie, get in
the fucking pool.

16:33.716 --> 16:35.166
Get in the pool.

16:49.560 --> 16:52.701
- Nice hits.
- You're in, wide out.

16:52.735 --> 16:54.289
Get that yellow one over here.

16:54.323 --> 16:56.498
- You got him man.
- He's out, he's out.

16:56.532 --> 16:57.740
Excuse me!

16:59.570 --> 17:02.435
Game's over, time to
go home. Park's closed.

17:02.469 --> 17:04.436
- Fuck you, pig.

17:04.471 --> 17:06.784
- What did you say, you
little shit? What's your name?

17:08.268 --> 17:09.659
- Let's go, Pop.
Let's go, let's go!

17:09.683 --> 17:11.926
- Oh, whoa, shit. You
actually said, fuck you, Pig.

17:15.550 --> 17:16.665
- Excuse me. Excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me,

17:16.690 --> 17:19.038
excuse me, ladies, little guy.

17:20.453 --> 17:22.317
Are you guests at the hotel?

17:22.351 --> 17:23.904
- Yeah.

17:23.939 --> 17:27.148
- Okay. Well I just need to
see a little identification.

17:27.184 --> 17:29.565
- Okay? It's up your butt
and around the corner.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.499
I need to
see some identification.

17:32.534 --> 17:34.915
- Look, I'm not trying
to get fired tonight.

17:34.950 --> 17:37.780
There is no room 69,
so whatever you guys

17:37.815 --> 17:40.231
have been giving her,
don't give her anymore.

17:40.266 --> 17:41.508
- Sir?
- Yes?

17:41.543 --> 17:43.993
- Do you treat all of
your guests this way.

17:44.028 --> 17:45.247
- Now, that's a
very good question

17:45.271 --> 17:46.962
and I'm glad we are
having this dialogue.

17:46.996 --> 17:49.482
The answer is no because
most of my guests

17:49.516 --> 17:50.793
don't swim in their underwear.

17:50.828 --> 17:52.761
- Why? Because you like it?

17:52.795 --> 17:53.795
Daddy like-y?

17:55.626 --> 17:56.937
- Guys, what?

17:56.972 --> 17:58.432
- You know what? My
daddy owns this hotel,

17:58.456 --> 18:00.296
and you're fucking fired
when he finds out about you.

18:00.320 --> 18:02.091
- Hey, hey, Jesus Christ.
Ladies, ladies, ladies.

18:02.115 --> 18:04.773
Your daddy should have
bought you some breath mints.

18:04.807 --> 18:06.223
- Fuck you! Fuck you!

18:06.257 --> 18:07.983
- Never fails, Jesus.

18:10.434 --> 18:12.170
- Ain't you supposed to
be at home or something?

18:12.194 --> 18:16.025
You know like a wife,
kids, uncle, nieces.

18:17.717 --> 18:20.513
- I don't know. I
couldn't sleep. I guess.

18:21.928 --> 18:24.931
So would you get in
trouble for being up here?

18:24.965 --> 18:27.520
- Nah, man, we come
up here all the time.

18:27.554 --> 18:29.211
Nobody ever sees us.

18:29.246 --> 18:30.246
- What's he doing?

18:31.593 --> 18:34.009
- This shit's about to
be fucking hilarious.

18:34.906 --> 18:37.185
Come on on old man, settle in.

18:37.219 --> 18:39.842
- Chicago to the
recycle, fuck you.

18:39.877 --> 18:40.878
- Oh my god.

18:52.855 --> 18:54.236
- It's like rent the runway.

18:55.168 --> 18:56.168
- Oh shit.

19:16.983 --> 19:18.812
- You got another one?

21:59.628 --> 22:00.628
- Hey.

22:03.356 --> 22:04.356
- Hello.

22:08.810 --> 22:10.329
- Are you the guy?

22:13.918 --> 22:18.751
- Maybe, I'm Alex.

22:21.547 --> 22:22.547
From the internet.

22:24.584 --> 22:25.584
- Yeah, I know.

22:28.381 --> 22:30.763
Why are you looking
at me like that?

22:30.797 --> 22:33.179
- I don't know. You're
just not what I expected.

22:34.905 --> 22:36.078
- What did you expect?

22:37.735 --> 22:39.599
- Someone older.

22:41.981 --> 22:42.981
- I'm old enough.

22:44.915 --> 22:45.915
- Okay.

22:50.265 --> 22:51.542
So how do we proceed?

22:54.787 --> 22:56.444
- We can't talk here.

23:01.069 --> 23:03.485
Well, are you coming or what?

24:09.413 --> 24:13.313
You can take your coat off.

24:22.150 --> 24:23.807
I know, it's stupid.

24:26.844 --> 24:27.844
- You did this?

24:29.122 --> 24:31.815
- Yeah.
- I like it.

24:33.541 --> 24:35.577
- You don't have to say that.
- I'm not.

24:36.785 --> 24:37.785
It's really good.

24:40.030 --> 24:41.030
- Thanks.

24:43.861 --> 24:45.000
You wanna sit down?

25:08.921 --> 25:12.890
So, how do we proceed?

25:15.721 --> 25:18.378
- Well, I don't know.

25:19.552 --> 25:21.830
I've never done anything
like this before.

25:21.865 --> 25:23.349
- Obviously.
- Have you?

25:26.007 --> 25:27.007
- No.

25:34.222 --> 25:36.224
Can I ask you a question?
- What?

25:38.191 --> 25:39.434
- Why are you doing this?

25:42.333 --> 25:43.921
- Because I can't do it anymore.

25:44.853 --> 25:46.303
- Do what?
- Any of it?

25:53.448 --> 25:55.450
- So, why don't you
just do it yourself?

25:58.073 --> 25:59.073
- I've tried.

26:00.006 --> 26:01.006
What is this?

26:03.872 --> 26:05.460
- Just some obituaries.

26:07.117 --> 26:12.087
- What? Like, you uh, you
cut, you cut all these out.

26:12.881 --> 26:13.881
- Yeah.

26:15.297 --> 26:16.782
You wanna see my favorite one?

26:18.680 --> 26:19.680
- I guess.

26:29.518 --> 26:30.518
Read it.

26:32.176 --> 26:35.110
- Chester McCaffrey, age 83.

26:36.871 --> 26:41.600
He served in the US
Navy from 1945 to 1949.

26:43.049 --> 26:45.673
He was a resident at the North
Halstead Retirement Center.

26:46.881 --> 26:51.368
He vastly enjoyed banana
bread and Miles Davis.

26:51.402 --> 26:53.232
He has no known
surviving family.

26:58.375 --> 26:59.514
That's just sad.

27:06.141 --> 27:07.315
Why do you save these?

27:13.321 --> 27:15.047
- I mean, these
people are all dead

27:17.152 --> 27:18.371
and their lives
are just summed up

27:18.395 --> 27:19.845
by a couple of paragraphs.

27:22.054 --> 27:24.263
It seems like the least
I can do is save them.

27:35.861 --> 27:36.861
Um, I

27:39.036 --> 27:40.036
- I should go.

27:41.176 --> 27:42.143
- Why?
- No, no, no, no.

27:42.177 --> 27:43.420
This, this was stupid.

27:44.283 --> 27:45.294
- Dude. You can't just leave.

27:45.318 --> 27:46.561
- I'm sorry. Here.

27:46.595 --> 27:48.597
Um, this is, this is
what I promised you.

27:51.014 --> 27:52.222
- Dude!

27:58.090 --> 28:01.369
- Hey, wait! Where
are you going?

28:01.403 --> 28:03.164
- I've gotta get to a meeting.

28:03.198 --> 28:05.373
- A meeting? What the hell dude.

28:08.445 --> 28:09.445
Hey!

28:11.034 --> 28:13.692
Hey!
- I'm sorry, but I fucked up.

28:13.726 --> 28:14.865
- I don't give a shit.

28:14.900 --> 28:17.005
You can't just leave.
You saw my face.

28:17.040 --> 28:18.351
- So?

28:18.386 --> 28:19.386
- So?

28:21.320 --> 28:23.011
Are you a cop?
- No.

28:23.046 --> 28:25.289
I'm not cop. I'm nobody.

28:29.155 --> 28:30.225
- I'm coming with you.

28:33.746 --> 28:37.646
- Hey, what? No, no. You
are not coming with me.

28:39.234 --> 28:40.729
- Whatever, you're probably
just gonna go rat me out

28:40.753 --> 28:43.825
to the cops.
- Seriously, go home.

28:45.275 --> 28:46.655
Ridiculous.
- Screw you.

28:52.869 --> 28:53.869
Asshole.

29:09.126 --> 29:11.888
- What the fuck is this?

29:11.922 --> 29:15.270
- AA meeting. What's so funny?

29:15.305 --> 29:17.894
- Dude, what kind of
suicidal loser goes to AA?

29:19.136 --> 29:21.207
- You have to keep
it quiet in here.

29:24.521 --> 29:25.694
- What step are you on?

29:25.729 --> 29:28.421
- Okay, everyone. Thank
you for coming out.

29:28.456 --> 29:30.630
I'm Jerry and I'm an alcoholic.

29:30.665 --> 29:32.115
Hi, Jerry.

29:32.149 --> 29:35.118
- I do see a couple of new faces
out there today and I wanna

29:35.152 --> 29:36.567
welcome you to the group.

29:36.602 --> 29:38.569
All right, let's go
ahead and open up

29:38.604 --> 29:39.847
the floor for discussion.

29:39.881 --> 29:42.194
- I'll go first.
- Oh, go ahead.

29:42.228 --> 29:45.611
- Hi. My name is Pearl
and I'm an alcoholic.

29:45.645 --> 29:47.613
Hi, Pearl.

29:47.647 --> 29:49.753
- I thank God every day

29:51.237 --> 29:55.207
for giving me the strength
to overcome my addiction.

29:55.241 --> 29:57.761
Before I accepted Jesus
Christ into my heart,

29:57.796 --> 30:00.281
I was powerless

30:01.351 --> 30:02.593
over my sins.

30:02.628 --> 30:05.942
Now, I am powerful
towards life and-

30:09.048 --> 30:12.155
- Miss, miss? please
don't interrupt.

30:12.189 --> 30:15.123
This is a group of unbiased
tolerance and understanding.

30:15.158 --> 30:16.573
- Why are you laughing?

30:16.607 --> 30:19.645
- It's it's okay. You
know, Pearl, just go ahead.

30:21.060 --> 30:24.374
- I just wanted to thank
all of you for your support.

30:24.408 --> 30:29.379
Thanks to your help, I'm
now a recovering alcoholic

30:30.276 --> 30:32.934
for the past eight years.

30:34.418 --> 30:35.350
Woo!

30:35.385 --> 30:37.076
I know. A long time.

30:37.111 --> 30:38.111
- Wow.

30:39.699 --> 30:41.598
- Miss, miss.
- Way to go, Pearl.

30:41.632 --> 30:44.290
- I'm Alex, and
I'm an alcoholic.

30:44.325 --> 30:46.845
Hi, Alex.

30:46.879 --> 30:50.469
- Okay. So, I have been
sober for almost three months

30:51.677 --> 30:56.406
and until the other
night and I, uh,

30:57.925 --> 31:00.444
I started thinking about all
the things that I can't control

31:00.479 --> 31:02.136
and I fell off the
deep end again.

31:08.763 --> 31:10.109
I'm a coward.

31:13.043 --> 31:18.014
And I drink because I do not
want to feel, you know? I, uh

31:19.808 --> 31:22.328
I, I drink because I
don't want to be alive.

31:22.363 --> 31:23.882
M-miss, you, uh,

31:23.916 --> 31:25.676
You can't smoke in here, please.

31:27.920 --> 31:29.059
- Sure thing, Jer.

31:29.094 --> 31:30.371
You cannot smoke in here.

31:33.132 --> 31:34.799
I'm sorry, I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

31:34.823 --> 31:37.757
Thank you.
- Okay, okay. Fuck this group.

31:37.792 --> 31:38.862
Fuck you, Jerry.

31:42.624 --> 31:47.043
Fuck You. You pathetic
fucking loser.

31:47.077 --> 31:48.630
I'll be at the bar
across the street

31:48.665 --> 31:49.873
if anyone wants a drink.

31:51.288 --> 31:53.912
Okay. Sometimes,
people aren't ready

31:55.120 --> 31:59.814
to accept this, but
Alex, please continue.

32:02.403 --> 32:03.403
- I'm sorry.

32:06.131 --> 32:07.615
I'm, I'm very sorry.

32:21.387 --> 32:22.387
You fucking happy?

32:23.872 --> 32:25.426
- You fucking serious
with this shit?

32:25.460 --> 32:27.221
- It keeps me going
if I need it to.

32:28.877 --> 32:30.949
- So, what? You're never
gonna have a drink again?

32:32.364 --> 32:34.484
- I'm just trying to get
through the fucking day, man.

32:37.403 --> 32:38.232
- So now, what?

32:38.266 --> 32:39.509
- Oh my, now, what?

32:39.543 --> 32:42.270
You had your fun.
So, just go away.

32:42.305 --> 32:43.454
- What, are you blowing me off?

32:43.478 --> 32:44.478
- Yes. Yes.

32:46.067 --> 32:47.517
- Well, fuck, dude.

32:47.551 --> 32:48.345
I mean, I thought we could
hang out or something.

32:48.380 --> 32:49.622
- Are you fucking crazy?

32:49.657 --> 32:50.899
- No, I'm fucking bored.

32:54.110 --> 32:55.984
Since you were gonna have me
blow your brains out earlier

32:56.008 --> 32:58.045
I figured you didn't
have any other plans.

32:59.805 --> 33:01.462
- You were gonna
blow my brains out?

33:02.911 --> 33:06.122
- I'm just saying. You
wanna hang out, or what?

33:13.336 --> 33:14.336
- What's your name?

33:15.269 --> 33:16.269
- October.

33:18.168 --> 33:19.687
- You like pancakes?
- What?

33:41.226 --> 33:42.848
- This place is a fucking dump.

33:42.882 --> 33:44.263
- I like it.

33:44.298 --> 33:46.127
- Yeah. Well it's a shithole.

33:46.162 --> 33:48.405
- Have the best blueberry
pancakes in the whole city.

33:48.440 --> 33:50.269
- And that sort of
thing impresses you?

33:52.651 --> 33:53.962
- You can't smoke in here.

33:55.171 --> 33:57.104
- Well, you can't tell
me what to do, Daddy.

33:57.138 --> 33:59.589
You like that? Do you like
when I call you daddy?

33:59.623 --> 34:04.076
- No. It's just that you
can't smoke in restaurants

34:04.111 --> 34:05.595
in Chicago anymore.

34:05.629 --> 34:07.079
- Since when?

34:07.114 --> 34:08.953
- Well, they passed a
law like a long time ago.

34:08.976 --> 34:10.703
- There's no smoking
in here, Miss.

34:12.636 --> 34:14.224
You're gonna have
to put it away.

34:15.121 --> 34:16.121
- Sure.

34:20.299 --> 34:21.818
- Are you ready to order?

34:21.851 --> 34:24.545
- Yes. We'll take two orders
of your blueberry pancakes.

34:24.579 --> 34:27.341
And what do you want?
Sausage or bacon?

34:27.375 --> 34:30.239
- Who says I want either,
or pancakes for that matter?

34:30.275 --> 34:31.447
- She'll take the bacon.

34:37.246 --> 34:38.800
So what do you do?

34:38.835 --> 34:40.078
- What do you mean?

34:40.112 --> 34:42.321
- I mean, what do you
do with your life?

34:42.356 --> 34:43.840
Like you have a
job or something?

34:43.873 --> 34:47.326
- Well, I was going to art
school, but taking a break.

34:47.360 --> 34:49.639
- Why?
- What does it matter?

34:49.672 --> 34:51.123
- Oh, I'm sorry.

34:51.158 --> 34:52.963
I'm just trying to initiate
a conversation. I mean,

34:52.987 --> 34:55.092
you're the one who suggested
we should hang out.

34:58.303 --> 35:00.408
- I'm taking a break
because I feel like it

35:01.754 --> 35:03.963
I just gotta figure
some shit out.

35:03.998 --> 35:05.493
What? You wanna know
something else about me?

35:05.517 --> 35:07.391
What else do you wanna know?
You wanna know my birthday?

35:07.415 --> 35:09.176
My Zodiac sign?

35:09.210 --> 35:12.075
Maybe favorite sexual position?

35:12.110 --> 35:14.491
- Oh my geez, could you just
please not talk like that?

35:14.526 --> 35:16.183
- Whatever you want. Daddy.

35:30.783 --> 35:32.751
Do you do this often?

35:32.785 --> 35:34.442
What? Eat
blueberry pancakes

35:34.477 --> 35:35.995
at shitty diners?

35:36.030 --> 35:38.446
No meet strange
men off the internet.

35:39.689 --> 35:41.208
Well, when you put it like that.

35:42.174 --> 35:43.174
- I'm just curious.

35:44.935 --> 35:46.879
- I didn't know that people
could hire other people

35:46.903 --> 35:49.388
off the internet
to kill them, so.

35:49.423 --> 35:53.185
- Well, I was having
a bad couple of days.

35:54.290 --> 35:55.877
- Yeah, well, join the club pal.

35:58.777 --> 36:00.261
Why do you wanna die so badly?

36:01.780 --> 36:02.884
- I have my reasons.

36:04.817 --> 36:06.509
- What, you just
changed your mind?

36:07.406 --> 36:08.406
- For now.

36:14.068 --> 36:15.804
- You're like, the biggest
psycho I've ever met.

36:15.828 --> 36:17.589
- Says the girl with
the purple hair.

36:19.832 --> 36:22.145
- I like my purple hair.
- It's a look.

36:24.320 --> 36:25.320
- It's a good look.

36:26.253 --> 36:27.737
October, this is bad.

36:28.807 --> 36:30.049
Really weird.

36:30.084 --> 36:31.223
So what are you doing, now?

36:31.258 --> 36:32.431
Do you want some company?

36:32.466 --> 36:33.881
Why do you want
to hang out with me?

36:33.915 --> 36:35.065
Look, if you
don't want me to hang around,

36:35.089 --> 36:36.089
just say so.

36:37.298 --> 36:38.403
No, it's okay.

36:47.170 --> 36:51.830
Here. We're gonna have to
get you a heavier coat.

36:53.383 --> 36:54.591
- Yeah. Thanks.

37:04.912 --> 37:09.882
Whoa. So are you a
serial killer or?

37:10.642 --> 37:12.160
- No. Just divorced.

37:14.922 --> 37:16.303
- How long were you married?

37:17.269 --> 37:18.822
- I'd rather not talk about it.

37:20.824 --> 37:22.723
- So, she got everything, huh?

37:22.757 --> 37:24.828
- I don't need all
that stuff around me.

37:24.863 --> 37:26.658
- Kind of looks
like you got robbed.

37:26.692 --> 37:28.073
How do you live like this?

37:28.107 --> 37:29.107
- It suits me.

37:33.699 --> 37:34.700
- Dude. Holy shit!

37:34.735 --> 37:35.735
- Oh no.

37:57.827 --> 37:58.827
This is for you.

38:04.420 --> 38:05.869
- What is it?

38:05.904 --> 38:07.733
- It's a prehistoric,
mutated lizard.

38:09.183 --> 38:11.737
The horns on his face
are for self defense.

38:13.946 --> 38:14.946
- Thanks.

38:19.331 --> 38:20.608
Why do you have all these?

38:22.610 --> 38:23.956
- I saved them for my kids.

38:25.820 --> 38:28.651
- You have kids?
- Mm-hmm.

38:28.685 --> 38:30.100
- How many?
- Two.

38:31.550 --> 38:32.550
- Boys or girls?

38:34.898 --> 38:36.831
- I have a boy,
and I have a girl.

38:39.524 --> 38:40.663
- What are their names?

38:42.699 --> 38:46.703
- My son's name is Kyle and
my daughter's name is June.

38:46.738 --> 38:48.498
- She was named after
a month, like me.

38:48.533 --> 38:49.533
- Yep.

38:52.019 --> 38:53.331
- Do they like you?

38:53.365 --> 38:55.091
- What kind of question is that?

38:55.125 --> 38:56.334
- I don't know.

38:57.887 --> 38:59.682
Most kids hate their parents.

38:59.716 --> 39:00.716
I hated mine.

39:04.307 --> 39:07.483
- Well, I think June
is still on the fence.

39:12.108 --> 39:13.351
Kyle will always hate me.

39:21.359 --> 39:22.359
Let's go.

39:26.847 --> 39:29.953
- So, where are we going?
- You ask a lot of questions.

39:30.885 --> 39:32.000
- Well, I just wanna make sure

39:32.024 --> 39:32.922
you're not a murderer
or something.

39:32.956 --> 39:35.062
- No-one's forcing you to come.

39:35.096 --> 39:36.857
- So, say you're not a murderer.

39:36.891 --> 39:39.031
- Seriously?
- Yeah. Say it.

39:39.066 --> 39:41.827
- I'm not a murderer. All right?

39:43.898 --> 39:44.898
- Was that so hard?

40:18.726 --> 40:20.279
You have any like,
gum or anything?

40:20.314 --> 40:22.420
- Holy shit!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

40:22.454 --> 40:24.180
- Dude, you have a fucking gun.

40:24.214 --> 40:26.216
You have a fucking
gun. You're a murderer.

40:26.251 --> 40:28.149
- No, I'm not a murderer.

40:28.184 --> 40:29.737
- Then. Why are
you packing heat?

40:29.772 --> 40:30.772
Are you in a gang?

40:32.119 --> 40:34.155
Are you in a gang like old
dudes that do drive-bys

40:34.190 --> 40:36.088
at rival nursing homes and shit?

40:36.123 --> 40:37.123
- Cute.

40:45.270 --> 40:47.445
- So, is that how you
tried to kill yourself?

40:51.518 --> 40:55.314
Oh. Fuck, dude.

40:55.349 --> 40:56.349
- Yep.

41:07.534 --> 41:09.846
How old are you?

41:11.710 --> 41:14.541
How old do you think I am?

41:14.575 --> 41:16.715
I don't
know. Like, 50.

41:18.199 --> 41:19.199
- Really?
- What?

41:21.755 --> 41:22.790
- I'm 45.

41:24.551 --> 41:26.414
- No shit, really?

41:27.588 --> 41:29.659
- What? Why is that so shocking?

41:29.694 --> 41:32.317
- Just, I don't know.
It just sounds old.

41:33.732 --> 41:34.732
- Well, it is.

41:38.668 --> 41:40.359
- You don't really
look that old.

41:40.394 --> 41:41.602
- Yes I do.

41:41.637 --> 41:43.604
- No. I mean, you
could pass for like,

41:43.639 --> 41:44.743
I don't know, like 35.

41:48.160 --> 41:49.160
- Thank you.

42:03.279 --> 42:04.867
Where, where are we?

42:06.489 --> 42:09.975
Huh. October, just
wait here for a minute.

42:10.010 --> 42:11.459
I'll be right back.

42:34.241 --> 42:36.795
- What are you doing here?
- Hey, could I see June?

42:38.107 --> 42:40.592
- Alex, I, I can't
do this again, okay?

42:40.627 --> 42:42.698
You just can't keep
showing up here like this.

42:42.732 --> 42:44.527
- Please? I, I just,
just wanna say hello.

42:44.562 --> 42:46.322
- Yeah, it's not gonna happen.

42:46.356 --> 42:47.356
- Come on, Sara.

42:48.358 --> 42:49.774
- What do you expect me to do?

42:49.808 --> 42:51.361
- Well, just gimme a chance.

42:51.396 --> 42:54.986
- I've given you a chance. I've
given you a million chances.

42:55.020 --> 42:56.643
- Okay? All right.

42:56.677 --> 42:57.747
Look, give her this.

43:00.267 --> 43:02.269
- Alex.
- Please, Sara, come on.

43:02.303 --> 43:04.340
Give it to her. Just, you
don't even gotta tell her

43:04.374 --> 43:05.374
it's from me.

43:08.309 --> 43:10.001
- You have to go. Okay?
- Okay.

43:29.227 --> 43:30.227
Fuck it.

43:40.410 --> 43:42.447
Oh no, no. You
can't smoke in here.

43:43.793 --> 43:46.831
- Why not?
- Because I said so.

43:46.865 --> 43:47.970
- Oh, okay.

43:48.004 --> 43:49.523
- I mean it.
- Oh, come on, dude.

43:50.800 --> 43:53.182
Look, I'm not even
bothering you.

43:53.216 --> 43:56.012
Oh, hey, asshole. What the fuck?

43:56.047 --> 43:58.808
- It's a nasty habit.
You should quit.

43:58.843 --> 44:00.672
- You should stop
telling me what to do.

44:14.306 --> 44:16.930
Who was that woman?

44:19.001 --> 44:20.865
So, what? You're not
talking to me now.

44:21.831 --> 44:23.039
- I don't feel like talking.

44:25.352 --> 44:26.422
- Was that your wife?

44:27.561 --> 44:29.908
- Ex-wife.
- What's her name.

44:29.943 --> 44:32.497
- Fuck! Why do you ask so
many goddamn questions?

44:34.637 --> 44:35.603
- Let me out of the car.

44:35.638 --> 44:37.157
- What?
- Let me out!

44:37.191 --> 44:39.469
- No, I'm not gonna let you
out on the side of the road.

44:39.504 --> 44:40.688
- I can find my own
way home. Thank you.

44:40.712 --> 44:43.059
- Will you stop it?
You're not getting out.

44:44.647 --> 44:47.098
- Well then, let me drive.
- Why.

44:47.132 --> 44:49.341
- Either let me outta
the car, or let me drive.

45:01.802 --> 45:04.115
- Oh my God. What the
hell are you doing?

45:04.149 --> 45:05.564
Whoa.

45:05.599 --> 45:06.496
- Driving.

45:06.531 --> 45:08.706
- Well, you drive like shit.

45:19.820 --> 45:20.820
Where are we going?

45:22.512 --> 45:24.135
- I need to take
care of something.

45:31.694 --> 45:33.972
- Come on.
- What are we doing?

45:34.007 --> 45:36.078
- Why do you ask so
many goddamn questions?

45:36.112 --> 45:38.183
- Should I be worried?
- Probably.

45:43.154 --> 45:44.154
Okay.

45:47.606 --> 45:48.825
- Aren't you a
little bit too old

45:48.849 --> 45:51.300
to be hanging out with
my 24-year-old daughter.

45:52.163 --> 45:53.371
- Oh.

45:53.405 --> 45:55.718
- Leave him alone.
He's a friend.

45:55.753 --> 45:56.753
- Okay.

45:57.444 --> 45:58.928
- Good to see you too, Mother.

46:01.103 --> 46:03.381
- So, what is this shit
about dropping out?

46:05.624 --> 46:06.936
- What are you talking about?

46:06.971 --> 46:08.396
- You got a letter
from the Government

46:08.420 --> 46:10.768
demanding repayment of
the grant they gave you

46:10.802 --> 46:12.597
because you didn't
complete the semester.

46:12.631 --> 46:14.092
- What, are you going
through my mail?

46:14.116 --> 46:16.739
- It was addressed to me,
as your legal guardian.

46:16.774 --> 46:18.292
- Don't flatter yourself, Betty.

46:18.327 --> 46:19.604
You're not my guardian.

46:19.638 --> 46:21.261
- Why didn't you tell
me you dropped out?

46:21.295 --> 46:22.952
- I didn't drop out.

46:22.987 --> 46:24.436
I'm just taking a break.

46:24.471 --> 46:28.199
- Well, as far as the United
States Government is concerned,

46:28.233 --> 46:29.717
you're a dropout!

46:40.038 --> 46:41.246
What are you looking for?

46:42.420 --> 46:43.638
- Savings my sick
Grandma Lilly gave me.

46:43.662 --> 46:45.872
What the fuck did
you do with them?

46:45.906 --> 46:46.906
- I sold them.

46:53.051 --> 46:54.052
- You what?

46:54.087 --> 46:55.087
- I sold them.

46:57.124 --> 46:59.333
- Those weren't yours to sell.

46:59.368 --> 47:03.199
- Well, when you write a $300
check of mine in your name,

47:03.234 --> 47:04.649
I figure you owe me.

47:04.683 --> 47:07.548
- God dammit, Betty.
I fucking need those.

47:07.583 --> 47:10.862
- Why, to go and get high?
That is not how I raised you.

47:10.897 --> 47:13.071
- No, you raised me to be a
pathetic, fall-down drunk.

47:13.106 --> 47:14.141
I just didn't follow-

47:21.183 --> 47:22.874
You couldn't hurt
me if you tried.

47:30.261 --> 47:31.538
- What is with you, man?

48:02.776 --> 48:05.468
- Do you wanna talk
about anything?

48:08.368 --> 48:10.991
- There's nothing to talk about.

48:13.131 --> 48:15.168
- Yeah. It's really
hard to be a parent.

48:16.272 --> 48:17.732
- What are you
actually defending her?

48:17.756 --> 48:19.897
- No, no, I am not.

48:23.555 --> 48:27.456
I'm just, I'm just
saying that uh, sometimes

48:27.490 --> 48:28.802
it's really, really hard.

48:30.459 --> 48:33.289
I mean, as a parent,
you're supposed to have

48:33.324 --> 48:37.811
all of the answers
and most of the time,

48:37.845 --> 48:40.779
you're just as clueless as
your kids, if not, more.

48:40.814 --> 48:42.195
- She's not really a parent.

48:43.782 --> 48:46.130
She's a crazy lady I was
forced to be raised by.

48:48.649 --> 48:50.237
She's only happy when I fuck up.

48:51.998 --> 48:53.516
- That's how my old man was.

48:56.002 --> 48:57.002
- How so?

49:00.040 --> 49:02.870
- He just loved to tell
me how I was always

49:02.905 --> 49:04.976
wrong about everything.

49:07.323 --> 49:08.704
He was a big military guy.

49:09.981 --> 49:12.950
Thought it was our duty
to serve our country.

49:14.813 --> 49:17.057
He was pissed off when
I didn't join The Army.

49:18.507 --> 49:20.209
And then he spent the
rest of his life thinking

49:20.233 --> 49:21.268
I was a coward.

49:23.443 --> 49:24.962
I think I see, he was right.

49:30.553 --> 49:31.737
- Well, at least
you can do something

49:31.761 --> 49:33.004
different with your kids.

49:47.708 --> 49:48.882
- You wanna go to the movies?

49:48.916 --> 49:50.297
Possibly take all the racket.

49:50.332 --> 49:52.472
Those, those things smashing
through the windows.

49:52.506 --> 49:53.749
Well you're her father.

49:53.783 --> 49:55.554
If you're stupid enough
to go die on that trap,

49:55.578 --> 49:57.684
That's your business. However,
I am not stupid enough

49:57.718 --> 50:00.066
to follow you. It is
tough for the kid.

50:00.100 --> 50:01.515
That old man is so stupid.

50:02.723 --> 50:04.622
Now, get the hell
down in the cellar.

50:04.656 --> 50:06.576
You can be the boss down
there. I'm boss up here.

50:13.389 --> 50:15.081
- You know, I want to
open this door again.

50:15.115 --> 50:17.738
I mean it. Mr. Cooper,
with your help, we can-

50:17.773 --> 50:18.981
- With my help?

50:19.016 --> 50:21.328
- Let him go, man.
His mind is made up.

50:21.363 --> 50:22.363
Just let him go.

50:25.781 --> 50:27.379
- Do you ever wonder what
your life would be like

50:27.403 --> 50:30.337
if you never got
married or had kids.

50:32.029 --> 50:36.964
- Yeah, but that kind
of thinking doesn't
get me anywhere.

50:43.592 --> 50:45.456
- Can we go somewhere?

50:45.490 --> 50:46.629
I wanna show you something.

50:46.664 --> 50:48.528
- Where.
- It's a surprise.

50:50.012 --> 50:51.012
Come on.

50:59.815 --> 51:01.265
Why'd you bring me here?

51:04.544 --> 51:06.097
- Where I go when I need to cry.

51:09.307 --> 51:10.791
- What is it about this place?

51:14.278 --> 51:15.278
- I don't know.

51:17.350 --> 51:21.216
I guess that I like that no
one can hear me over the sound

51:21.250 --> 51:23.045
of the waves crashing and...

51:24.805 --> 51:27.912
- And what?
- Nothing. It's stupid.

51:27.946 --> 51:30.570
- I believe we've passed
that portion of the evening.

51:38.025 --> 51:39.648
- I guess it makes
me feel better

51:41.960 --> 51:44.722
knowing that my
tears hit the water

51:46.172 --> 51:50.900
and become something bigger.
Told you it was stupid.

51:51.798 --> 51:52.971
- I don't think it's stupid.

51:53.006 --> 51:54.486
I think it's actually
quite beautiful.

52:02.291 --> 52:04.673
- Tell me something no-one
else knows about you.

52:13.647 --> 52:16.374
- I uh, tried to kill myself
the other night with that gun

52:16.409 --> 52:17.444
you found in my car

52:20.551 --> 52:21.690
at this exact spot.

52:26.281 --> 52:27.281
- Are you serious?

52:28.145 --> 52:29.663
- Kind of hard to believe, huh?

52:32.873 --> 52:34.220
- What happened?

52:34.254 --> 52:35.876
- Same thing that
always happens.

52:38.948 --> 52:41.088
I couldn't bring myself
to pull the trigger.

52:42.987 --> 52:46.611
- When I was 14. I um, I
swallowed a bottle of pills

52:46.646 --> 52:49.269
that I found in my
mom's medicine cabinet.

52:49.304 --> 52:50.304
- You did that?

52:53.618 --> 52:54.826
- Yeah, I don't know why.

52:57.898 --> 53:00.384
I just remember
flashes of things.

53:04.767 --> 53:08.495
There was an ambulance that
came to my house and I remember

53:08.530 --> 53:13.500
these coarse fingers
holding my mouth open.

53:14.260 --> 53:15.330
They pumped my stomach.

53:18.229 --> 53:19.679
- You dunno why you did that?

53:21.301 --> 53:24.580
- I don't know. Bored, I guess.

53:29.344 --> 53:31.346
- You sure do seem
to get bored a lot.

53:34.797 --> 53:35.797
- Yeah.

53:37.697 --> 53:38.697
- You bored now?

53:42.391 --> 53:44.807
- I don't know what I am now.

54:01.686 --> 54:03.046
Cold. That's what I am.
- You cold?

54:12.110 --> 54:13.733
What is this?

54:13.767 --> 54:15.873
- It's a party, dumbass.

54:15.907 --> 54:18.910
- Uh-uh. Nope. I
shouldn't be here.

54:18.945 --> 54:20.888
- Oh, come on, dude. Chill
out. It's gonna be fine.

54:20.912 --> 54:22.776
- No, I, I gotta go to
work tomorrow morning.

54:22.811 --> 54:24.053
I gotta take off.

54:24.088 --> 54:26.401
- Relax. Take your
coat off. Chill out.

54:26.435 --> 54:27.574
Let's have some fun.

54:27.609 --> 54:28.609
- October!

54:34.478 --> 54:35.720
It's my birthday.

54:36.859 --> 54:38.447
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

54:40.622 --> 54:43.280
Who's, who's that?
- It's Alex.

54:45.282 --> 54:49.251
- Oh!

54:49.286 --> 54:50.286
- Mwah!

54:51.322 --> 54:53.359
You're welcome.

54:53.393 --> 54:55.809
- Happy birthday, Stephanie.
- Thank you.

54:55.844 --> 54:59.226
It's Stephanie's birthday!

55:00.435 --> 55:02.782
- We'll see you later.
Happy birthday, Steph.

55:02.816 --> 55:04.301
- Yo, what's good?

55:04.335 --> 55:05.726
You make it to Coffin's
show last night?

55:05.750 --> 55:07.407
- No, I got a little distracted.

55:07.442 --> 55:09.616
- My God. He's brilliant
since his mom died.

55:11.204 --> 55:16.174
- So, in my dream, I was
like ninja warrior, princess.

55:17.624 --> 55:21.904
And I had to, I had to fight
to protect my red balloon

55:23.527 --> 55:26.219
Because of the whole reality.

55:26.253 --> 55:30.706
- What's up, man? You
came with October, right?

55:30.741 --> 55:33.985
The hardest part, raging.

55:34.020 --> 55:36.125
- Yo, who's that
guy you came with?

55:36.160 --> 55:39.163
- I don't know.
He's just a friend.

55:44.513 --> 55:46.964
Living out that
daddy fantasy for real, huh?

55:46.998 --> 55:48.621
- I mean?

55:48.655 --> 55:50.933
- Fuck you guys.
What, are you jealous?

55:50.968 --> 55:52.935
- What the fuck's
wrong with you?

55:52.970 --> 55:55.869
- Nothing. I just, I don't
feel like, I don't know.

55:55.904 --> 55:57.250
I'm not in it tonight.

56:00.149 --> 56:01.149
See you guys later.

56:02.807 --> 56:03.877
- Where are you going?

56:21.205 --> 56:23.587
- So, how'd you
and October meet?

56:23.621 --> 56:26.797
- We just, we just met
recently at the record store.

56:26.831 --> 56:29.903
- Oh, so you're at a
party with her now?

56:29.938 --> 56:30.938
- Yeah, I guess.

56:32.423 --> 56:34.805
- So, what are your
intentions with her?

56:37.497 --> 56:38.705
- What do you mean?

56:38.740 --> 56:41.259
- I mean, what do
you wanna do to her?

56:43.434 --> 56:46.748
- Well, I don't intend
to do anything to her.

56:51.304 --> 56:52.823
- Just so you know, I know her.

56:52.857 --> 56:54.041
In fact, I know her very well.

56:54.065 --> 56:56.585
October can get confused
in life sometimes.

56:56.620 --> 56:58.114
And what she doesn't need
is someone coming in and

56:58.138 --> 57:00.254
manipulating her to do things
that she doesn't need to be

57:00.278 --> 57:02.211
doing, you know?

57:02.246 --> 57:04.593
- Well, I'm not manipulating
her to do anything.

57:05.801 --> 57:07.020
And as a friend, maybe
you should give her

57:07.044 --> 57:08.114
a little more credit.

57:09.426 --> 57:11.635
- Yeah. I'll do that.

57:19.263 --> 57:21.299
- Nice to meet you.
- Sir.

57:47.671 --> 57:49.500
- Oh my God. Oh, fuck!

57:49.535 --> 57:51.295
Oh, what?

57:51.329 --> 57:53.780
- Oh, fuck! I'm late for work.

57:53.815 --> 57:56.438
- So?
- I can't be late for work.

57:57.957 --> 57:58.992
I'll call you later.

58:01.892 --> 58:02.892
- Bye.

58:09.624 --> 58:12.005
- Yes, ma'am, and
have a great day.

58:16.078 --> 58:17.078
- Hey, Alex.

58:19.288 --> 58:21.463
Could you join me in
my office for a minute?

58:49.353 --> 58:50.354
So, what's going on?

58:51.286 --> 58:52.286
- What do you mean?

58:53.150 --> 58:54.190
- Why you were late today?

58:54.220 --> 58:56.084
- Oh yeah.

58:56.118 --> 58:57.154
I'm sorry about that.

58:58.983 --> 58:59.983
- What happened?

59:01.676 --> 59:03.747
- Nothing. I mean,
I just overslept.

59:06.439 --> 59:07.958
- Overslept.
- Yep.

59:09.580 --> 59:11.075
- Is there something
you wanna tell me?

59:11.099 --> 59:12.238
- Nope.
- You sure?

59:14.758 --> 59:16.632
- If you got something to
say, you should just say it.

59:16.656 --> 59:19.694
- This is all just
very familiar, Alex.

59:19.728 --> 59:21.281
- What's that, Patrick?

59:21.316 --> 59:23.974
- You, showing up late
to work oversleeping.

59:24.008 --> 59:26.597
If you don't remember, we've
had this problem before.

59:26.632 --> 59:29.842
- Hey, uh. Yeah. But today is
not like those other times.

59:29.876 --> 59:32.327
- Yeah. I've heard
that before too.

59:32.361 --> 59:35.572
- I'm sorry. Man, I overslept.
These things happen.

59:35.606 --> 59:37.366
- They seem like they
happen to you a lot.

59:37.401 --> 59:39.714
- Man, you're blowing this
thing way out of proportion.

59:39.748 --> 59:41.854
- I stuck my neck on
the line for you before,

59:41.888 --> 59:44.960
because you promised me you had
your problems under control.

59:44.995 --> 59:46.731
You looked at me straight
in my face and you told me

59:46.755 --> 59:48.491
I wasn't gonna have to
deal with this anymore.

59:48.515 --> 59:51.380
- I was late. It's
a one-time thing.

59:51.415 --> 59:52.415
I'm not drunk.

59:54.245 --> 59:55.522
I haven't been drinking.

59:55.557 --> 59:58.146
- Yeah. Well, this
is how it starts.

59:58.180 --> 01:00:00.804
Next thing I know, you're not
showing up to work for days

01:00:00.838 --> 01:00:04.083
and I got your wife
calling me, the police.

01:00:04.117 --> 01:00:05.567
This is an office, Alex.

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:07.510
This is a place of business,
and I don't have time

01:00:07.534 --> 01:00:09.433
for any more excuses.

01:00:09.467 --> 01:00:12.816
Listen, I know things
have been rough

01:00:12.850 --> 01:00:14.438
since you and Sara separated.

01:00:15.646 --> 01:00:17.993
I can't even fathom what
you had to go through,

01:00:18.028 --> 01:00:21.963
the devastation of
losing a child like that.

01:00:21.997 --> 01:00:24.724
Kyle was too young to have
had to go through any of that.

01:00:26.553 --> 01:00:31.213
- Don't you ever say his
name? You know nothing.

01:00:33.284 --> 01:00:34.769
- I'm sorry, Alex.

01:00:34.803 --> 01:00:37.495
- You couldn't even possibly
imagine what it feels like to

01:00:37.530 --> 01:00:38.530
watch your son

01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:43.122
just wither away.

01:00:43.156 --> 01:00:44.951
Be powerless to do
anything about it.

01:00:48.990 --> 01:00:50.923
You spare me the
fucking pep talk, yeah?

01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:56.929
- Well, despite everything
there comes a point

01:00:56.963 --> 01:01:00.001
when enough is enough. We're
gonna have to let you go.

01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:05.627
- No, you can't.
You can't fire me.

01:01:06.732 --> 01:01:08.147
Patrick, I need this job.

01:01:08.181 --> 01:01:11.357
- I'm sorry, Alex. It is
outta my hands at this point.

01:01:15.292 --> 01:01:18.467
- Wow. You're a
real piece of work.

01:01:18.502 --> 01:01:19.502
Go Fuck yourself.

01:01:35.726 --> 01:01:38.108
- Yo. What was your
problem last night?

01:01:38.142 --> 01:01:39.799
- Good morning to you too.

01:01:39.834 --> 01:01:41.007
- Why'd you blow us off?

01:01:42.250 --> 01:01:43.537
- I just didn't feel
like it last night.

01:01:43.561 --> 01:01:44.839
- You like a straight-edge now?

01:01:44.873 --> 01:01:46.599
- No, I just need a break.

01:01:46.633 --> 01:01:47.945
- From what?
- Everything.

01:01:49.153 --> 01:01:50.465
- So, what do you want?

01:01:50.499 --> 01:01:52.570
- I don't know.
Something different.

01:01:54.331 --> 01:01:55.815
What's so funny.

01:01:55.850 --> 01:01:57.413
- It's just you. You're never
satisfied with something.

01:01:57.437 --> 01:01:58.725
You always want
something different.

01:01:58.749 --> 01:02:00.209
First, you're a
photographer, then a painter,

01:02:00.233 --> 01:02:01.486
then a writer. Tomorrow,
you'll probably be a dentist.

01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:02.995
- Fuck you Josh.

01:02:03.029 --> 01:02:04.386
Sorry I don't have it all
figured out Like you do.

01:02:04.410 --> 01:02:05.690
It must be really
nice living off

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:07.137
Mommy and Daddy's trust fund.

01:02:09.001 --> 01:02:10.001
- Here.

01:02:11.969 --> 01:02:14.592
It's for when you
change your mind, again.

01:02:14.627 --> 01:02:15.835
See you around.

01:02:34.992 --> 01:02:36.269
- What are you doing here?

01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:39.756
- Bored. Thought maybe
we could do something.

01:02:39.790 --> 01:02:41.481
- I don't have
time for this shit.

01:02:49.455 --> 01:02:50.801
- Hey Alex, Alex!

01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:54.943
Dude, what's your problem?

01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:56.910
Alex!

01:03:00.259 --> 01:03:02.675
Asshole, I'm talking to you
- Not now. Go home.

01:03:02.709 --> 01:03:06.230
- What the fuck? Alex, hold on.

01:03:11.373 --> 01:03:13.203
- Hey!
- What the fuck?

01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:16.413
I said go home.

01:03:16.447 --> 01:03:17.897
- I'm not going anywhere.

01:03:17.932 --> 01:03:22.143
- October, I don't wanna
play house with you anymore.

01:03:23.109 --> 01:03:24.317
- What?

01:03:24.352 --> 01:03:25.812
- I'm not your boyfriend
and I am definitely

01:03:25.836 --> 01:03:29.288
not your fucking daddy. So
whatever fantasy you got

01:03:29.322 --> 01:03:33.982
playing in your head is
over. So go home. go home.

01:03:36.674 --> 01:03:38.435
Hey, don't you, don't.

01:03:44.165 --> 01:03:47.271
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:03:47.306 --> 01:03:48.548
The fuck is wrong with you?

01:03:48.583 --> 01:03:50.447

the fucking trigger.

Alex, where the hell you been?

01:03:57.523 --> 01:03:59.042
Ah, I been around.

01:03:59.076 --> 01:04:00.043
Haven't seen you in a while.

01:04:00.077 --> 01:04:00.975
We were just talking about you.

01:04:01.009 --> 01:04:03.356
Yep. Can I get a drink?

01:04:03.391 --> 01:04:04.391
Yeah, sure.

01:04:06.118 --> 01:04:07.878
What'll it be your,
your usual I assume?

01:04:07.913 --> 01:04:09.466
- Yeah.
- All right.

- Sweeney, fill me up.

01:05:07.593 --> 01:05:08.881
- I think you've had
enough for the night.

01:05:08.905 --> 01:05:11.873
Well, I'm not paying
you for your thinking.

01:05:11.908 --> 01:05:13.426

01:05:14.393 --> 01:05:15.221
- I can't do that.

01:05:15.256 --> 01:05:16.464
- Hey, Hey!

01:05:16.498 --> 01:05:18.707

- Fill up my fucking glass.

01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:22.988
- Alex, take it fucking easy.

01:05:23.022 --> 01:05:23.989

- You have kids?

Keep going, okay?

01:07:29.252 --> 01:07:31.219
Oh Lord, look at you.

01:07:31.254 --> 01:07:32.703
What you doing here?

01:07:32.738 --> 01:07:34.258
What do you mean,
what am I doing here?

01:07:34.878 --> 01:07:38.502
I came here to watch you dance
and you were doing so good.

01:07:38.537 --> 01:07:40.056
So good. June-y.

01:07:43.162 --> 01:07:44.715
- Are you okay?

01:07:44.750 --> 01:07:45.750
- Ah, June.

01:07:47.201 --> 01:07:48.201

- Oh I'm yes I'm. Okay.

01:07:50.756 --> 01:07:52.344
How would you like the greatest

01:07:52.378 --> 01:07:53.562
blueberry pancakes
in the whole world?

01:07:53.586 --> 01:07:55.692
- Everything okay, June?

01:07:55.726 --> 01:07:58.004
- Oh, yes everything's okay.

01:07:58.039 --> 01:08:00.559
I'm her father. I'll be,
I'll be taking her home.

01:08:01.422 --> 01:08:02.422
- I'm okay.

01:08:03.527 --> 01:08:05.460
- Okay. I'll just help
you get her stuff. Okay?

01:08:05.495 --> 01:08:06.427
- Yeah, I'll be right back.

01:08:06.461 --> 01:08:11.432
Okay.

01:08:15.401 --> 01:08:17.609
It's me. It's Alex.
Where are you?

01:08:17.645 --> 01:08:19.716
I'm sorry about
it earlier. I, I,

01:08:19.750 --> 01:08:21.407
I should not have
acted like that.

01:08:24.341 --> 01:08:25.584
I mean, I fucked up.

01:08:26.792 --> 01:08:28.794
I, I got really fucked up, yes.

01:08:45.051 --> 01:08:47.709
- Who were you talking to?

01:08:47.743 --> 01:08:51.057
- Hmm. Oh, I was just
talking to a friend.

01:08:51.091 --> 01:08:53.024
- Was it the girl who
was sitting in the car

01:08:53.059 --> 01:08:54.371
when you came to our house?

01:08:55.545 --> 01:08:56.580
- You saw us?

01:08:56.615 --> 01:08:58.375
- I was watching
from the window.

01:08:58.410 --> 01:09:00.756
- Yeah, it was, it
was the same girl.

01:09:00.791 --> 01:09:02.930
- I like her hair.
- You do?

01:09:02.966 --> 01:09:04.278
- I like it too.

01:09:06.107 --> 01:09:08.040
- So good.
- Aren't they?

01:09:08.073 --> 01:09:11.008
The best pancakes in the
whole city. That's what I say.

01:09:17.636 --> 01:09:21.846
- Sir, is that your
silver Outback outside?

01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:25.506
- Yeah. Why?

01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:27.500
We're gonna need you to
come with us for a minute.

01:09:28.301 --> 01:09:30.787
- Dad, what's going on?

01:09:30.821 --> 01:09:34.687
- It's all right, Sweetie.
Let me talk to these guys.

01:09:34.721 --> 01:09:36.930
There's a misunderstanding here.

01:09:36.965 --> 01:09:38.702
- Sir, can you put your hands
out where I can see 'em?

01:09:38.725 --> 01:09:40.255
- Absolutely. Absolutely.
I just wanna talk to you.

01:09:40.279 --> 01:09:41.694
- And stay calm

01:09:41.729 --> 01:09:42.982
Sir, have you've
been drinking tonight?

01:09:43.006 --> 01:09:44.490
What are you talking about?

01:09:44.524 --> 01:09:45.571
Sir, I'm gonna
need you to put your hands

01:09:45.595 --> 01:09:46.492
behind your back.
- Dad?

01:09:46.527 --> 01:09:47.711
- Everything's okay sweetheart.

01:09:47.734 --> 01:09:48.631
- Sir, put your hands
behind your back.

01:09:48.667 --> 01:09:49.978
- Hey, you don't yell at me.

01:09:50.013 --> 01:09:53.154
- Let go of him, let go! Let go!

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:55.708
Get your hands off of me

01:09:55.743 --> 01:09:56.709
Get down to the ground.

01:09:56.744 --> 01:09:59.505
Wilson, call an ambulance.

01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:00.540
- It's okay.

01:10:01.714 --> 01:10:02.898
June, June, it's
okay, sweetheart.

01:10:02.922 --> 01:10:04.648
It's okay, baby.

01:10:04.683 --> 01:10:05.822
It's alright, June.

01:10:05.856 --> 01:10:07.582
Don't cry. Don't cry.

01:10:07.617 --> 01:10:10.620
It's just a mistake.
They just made a mistake.

01:10:10.654 --> 01:10:13.278
They just made a little mistake.

01:10:22.287 --> 01:10:23.874
- Okay, copy that.

01:10:23.909 --> 01:10:25.669
- What happened to my daughter?

01:10:27.878 --> 01:10:29.915
- I don't know
anything about it, sir.

01:10:29.949 --> 01:10:31.261
They'll be with you in a minute.

01:10:31.296 --> 01:10:32.849
- I'm really worried about her.

01:10:34.264 --> 01:10:35.679
Do you know if she's okay.

01:10:35.714 --> 01:10:38.924
- Sir, when I know
something I will inform you.

01:10:38.958 --> 01:10:41.409
Please, just tell me she's okay.

01:10:44.999 --> 01:10:45.999
June?

01:10:48.416 --> 01:10:49.416
June-y!

01:10:51.764 --> 01:10:52.764
Come on.

01:10:55.285 --> 01:10:59.289
- Belt, shoes,

01:10:59.324 --> 01:11:02.016
tie. Anything else?

01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:11.819
Necklace, come on, everything.

01:11:11.853 --> 01:11:14.373
Everything. That,
that that's mine.

01:11:14.408 --> 01:11:18.412
Turn around. Hands
on the wall. Come on.

01:11:23.071 --> 01:11:24.728
- Oh God, oh my God.

01:11:27.283 --> 01:11:30.216
Fucking hate you.
Fucking hate you.

01:11:32.943 --> 01:11:33.943
Sara?

01:11:37.707 --> 01:11:40.157
- What the is fuck
wrong with you?

01:11:41.676 --> 01:11:43.160
- I messed up.

01:11:43.195 --> 01:11:45.346
- No, no, don't. You don't
get to make excuses anymore.

01:11:45.370 --> 01:11:46.370
You don't.

01:11:47.682 --> 01:11:49.995
I am not here to pick up the
pieces when you fall apart.

01:11:50.029 --> 01:11:51.445
That's not my job anymore.

01:11:51.479 --> 01:11:54.379
You are drunk again.

01:11:55.932 --> 01:11:58.175
You could have killed her.

01:11:58.210 --> 01:12:00.005
Could have killed her!

01:12:03.077 --> 01:12:04.250
You will never

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:09.670
You will never come
around us ever again.

01:12:09.704 --> 01:12:10.981
Do you get that?

01:12:11.016 --> 01:12:11.982
- Oh no, please don't do that.

01:12:12.017 --> 01:12:14.571
- You did this, you fuck!

01:12:14.606 --> 01:12:16.573
You did his. You did it.

01:12:20.508 --> 01:12:22.372
Goodbye, Alex. Goodbye.

01:13:52.704 --> 01:13:53.704
- Let's go.

01:15:13.129 --> 01:15:17.374
- $75 For the lot
fee, $150 for the tow.

01:15:22.138 --> 01:15:23.138
Round back.

01:17:20.187 --> 01:17:21.395
- I need help.

01:17:25.226 --> 01:17:26.226
- Me too.

01:17:40.138 --> 01:17:41.518
- Do you wanna go somewhere?

01:17:42.692 --> 01:17:43.866
- Where do you wanna go?

01:17:48.077 --> 01:17:49.077
- I don't know.

01:17:50.976 --> 01:17:51.976
Anywhere.

01:17:54.083 --> 01:17:55.878
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:18:01.918 --> 01:18:03.506
- You look like shit.

01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:06.543
- Well, it's been quite a night.

01:18:15.173 --> 01:18:17.969
- Do you know
someone buried here?

01:18:18.003 --> 01:18:19.003
- Yeah, my son.

01:18:21.386 --> 01:18:22.698
- What?

01:18:22.732 --> 01:18:24.009
- He died three years ago.

01:18:28.634 --> 01:18:32.224
I've never talked
about it to anyone.

01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:36.020
- How did he die?

01:18:45.134 --> 01:18:46.307
- He was sick.

01:18:47.964 --> 01:18:51.243
He had a rare
cancer in his bones.

01:18:54.108 --> 01:18:56.732
He uh, fought it for
a really long time.

01:18:58.699 --> 01:18:59.700
He was a tough kid.

01:19:02.323 --> 01:19:04.532
He, he loved baseball.

01:19:04.567 --> 01:19:06.120
He was really good at baseball.

01:19:12.195 --> 01:19:14.508
- I dunno what to
say. I'm sorry.

01:19:14.542 --> 01:19:15.578
- Oh, it's okay.

01:19:18.719 --> 01:19:20.169
After Kyle died,

01:19:20.203 --> 01:19:22.447
everyone felt like they
had to give me a big speech

01:19:22.481 --> 01:19:23.759
and try and comfort me.

01:19:32.526 --> 01:19:35.978
I prefer if people just
don't say anything at all,

01:19:40.845 --> 01:19:43.744
but

01:20:04.661 --> 01:20:07.181
Do you wanna
get some shitty pancakes?
