WEBVTT

00:05.373 --> 00:07.475
You're my Elizabeth...

00:07.508 --> 00:10.311
and no one else
is to play with you.

00:10.344 --> 00:11.412
You have the backing

00:11.445 --> 00:13.581
of every single Catholic
in this country.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.116
I question why
we are asked to fund

00:15.149 --> 00:16.417
a war we were told was won.

00:16.450 --> 00:18.119
Because it was!
Or do you believe

00:18.152 --> 00:19.520
stealing a girl away
in the middle of the night

00:19.553 --> 00:22.289
and pleading for French
assistance the act of winners?

00:24.158 --> 00:26.260
All this for me?

00:26.293 --> 00:28.496
<i>My wife questions
whether you and Catherine</i>

00:28.529 --> 00:30.264
<i>are the best guardians
for Jane,</i>

00:30.297 --> 00:32.566
matching her with the king
in the future.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.535
Listen! I am meant to conduct--

00:34.568 --> 00:35.703
Enough!

00:35.736 --> 00:38.139
You are in this room
not to rule

00:38.172 --> 00:40.574
but to learn
from those that do, from me.

00:40.608 --> 00:43.344
<i>What you've done
does not matter.</i>

00:43.377 --> 00:45.146
It's what people think
you have done

00:45.179 --> 00:46.680
<i>that is all that matters now.</i>

01:16.644 --> 01:19.413
Your hands are cold.

01:19.447 --> 01:22.416
All those things
that upset you...

01:22.450 --> 01:25.252
just leave them behind
at Chelsea.

01:25.286 --> 01:27.221
You'll make yourself unwell.

02:06.694 --> 02:08.496
Is it not to your liking,
Princess?

02:10.564 --> 02:11.732
Perhaps she's tired.

02:14.201 --> 02:15.636
She is present.

02:17.238 --> 02:18.239
<i>Forgive us.</i>

02:19.507 --> 02:21.775
My sister so oft talks
of Your Grace.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.845
Sir Anthony and I'd likely feel

02:24.879 --> 02:27.615
quite as much affection
for you as she.

02:29.450 --> 02:32.319
Affection must not slip
into overfamiliarity, though.

02:32.353 --> 02:34.288
I know you find me rude, Princess.

02:34.321 --> 02:38.559
I do apologize for it
every time.

02:38.592 --> 02:42.596
But overfamiliarity
is a charge I will not take.

02:42.630 --> 02:45.733
<i>I held your father,
the king's, hand</i>

02:45.766 --> 02:46.934
<i>as he lay dying.</i>

02:47.167 --> 02:50.771
So if not you, your kin,

02:50.804 --> 02:53.774
I am familiar with.

02:53.807 --> 02:57.545
Are you familiar with any of
my letters today, Sir Anthony?

02:57.578 --> 02:58.712
Princess.

02:58.746 --> 02:59.947
No letters have come for you.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.682
I have told you
I would tell you if they did.

03:01.715 --> 03:03.183
<i>No word.</i>

03:03.217 --> 03:04.685
<i>I assume it is
your stepmother, Catherine,</i>

03:04.718 --> 03:06.387
<i>you're so anxious
to hear from.</i>

03:07.688 --> 03:10.858
Strange she has not written
once in all this time.

03:10.891 --> 03:12.660
She's unwell
due to her pregnancy.

03:12.693 --> 03:13.928
Is she?

03:16.830 --> 03:18.232
That's not what I heard.

03:23.203 --> 03:26.874
I know I chide you for not
keeping patience, but Lord,

03:26.907 --> 03:30.311
my sister's husband was sent
to test mine as much as yours.

03:30.344 --> 03:31.612
I'm late, Kat.

03:41.989 --> 03:43.390
I have not bled
since we arrived here.

03:43.424 --> 03:44.425
You know this.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.562
Yes,
you've never been regular.

03:51.265 --> 03:53.934
Please don't make me say it.

03:53.968 --> 03:55.636
You know. Surely you know.

03:58.872 --> 04:01.308
I imagined you'd taken
a silly fancy to him.

04:03.377 --> 04:04.745
But this...

04:10.284 --> 04:11.819
When?

04:11.852 --> 04:12.853
I could not...

04:14.455 --> 04:16.523
More than once
you lay with him?

04:19.727 --> 04:22.029
I thought I knew you, Elizabeth.

04:23.731 --> 04:25.299
Should we fetch a woman?

04:27.635 --> 04:30.337
You wouldn't tell your sister,
would you?

04:30.371 --> 04:31.739
Even if you think
she could be trusted,

04:31.772 --> 04:32.806
I couldn't bear her knowing.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.274
I couldn't bear anyone knowing,

04:34.308 --> 04:35.643
if we--we fetch a woman.

04:35.676 --> 04:37.645
How knowledgeable you are
in these matters.

04:39.313 --> 04:41.782
<i>I know they can be found.</i>

04:41.815 --> 04:42.950
<i>- Everyone knows they can--</i>
- Quiet!

04:48.389 --> 04:50.791
If word gets out,

04:50.824 --> 04:53.694
then we will both
lose our heads.

04:53.727 --> 04:57.297
You're often late.
There is no need to act yet.

04:57.331 --> 04:59.500
If in time
you still don't bleed,

04:59.533 --> 05:00.901
I will find someone.

05:00.934 --> 05:02.803
But for now, tell no one.

05:05.572 --> 05:07.341
Does our Lady Catherine know?

05:17.851 --> 05:19.687
What pain you have caused.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.790
And shame you have brought.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.411
Please. No.

06:51.445 --> 06:52.746
- Fuck off.
- Ahh!

06:55.783 --> 06:58.752
I've always wanted to do that.

06:58.786 --> 07:01.054
How much for forgiveness,
Father?

07:06.627 --> 07:08.629
Filthy fucking Catholics.

07:36.657 --> 07:39.793
<i>As the idolatry
of the old faith is torn away,</i>

07:39.827 --> 07:42.095
we will bring hope
to the people.

07:42.129 --> 07:46.500
They will cheer in the streets
as we bring the true faith.

07:46.533 --> 07:49.169
And will do so all the more
now the Book of Common Prayer

07:49.203 --> 07:52.739
will be issued throughout
the country, to every parish.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.975
The new Josiah: Edward VI.

07:55.008 --> 07:58.779
The new Josiah:
Edward VI!

08:22.035 --> 08:25.772
We sinners do beseech thee
to hear us, O Lord;

08:25.806 --> 08:28.141
that it may please thee
to rule and govern

08:28.175 --> 08:31.278
thy holy Church Universal
in the right way.

08:31.511 --> 08:34.281
We beseech thee
to hear us, O Lord.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.949
All this
'cause you shouted at him.

08:35.983 --> 08:36.950
<i>That it may
please thee...</i>

08:36.984 --> 08:38.619
It's called appeasement.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.087
It's always been the strategy.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.588
<i>...our King
and Governor.</i>

08:41.622 --> 08:43.957
We beseech thee
to hear us, O Lord.

08:43.991 --> 08:46.760
Everyone looks very appeased
right now.

08:46.793 --> 08:48.962
<i>...to rule his heart
in thy faith, fear, and love,</i>

08:48.996 --> 08:50.564
<i>that it may always have...</i>

08:50.597 --> 08:52.266
<i>Regretting the bishop's release already?</i>

08:52.299 --> 08:54.568
<i>To ever seek
thy honor and glory.</i>

08:54.601 --> 08:56.103
We beseech thee
to hear us, O Lord.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.738
What is going on with you, man?

08:57.771 --> 08:59.940
You spent 40 years
resolutely immutable,

08:59.973 --> 09:01.575
and now you're
as changeable as...

09:01.608 --> 09:04.645
- As what?
- As your brother.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.313
<i>We beseech thee
to hear us, O Lord.</i>

09:06.546 --> 09:08.782
Don't worry
about the bishop.

09:08.815 --> 09:10.217
Or Mary.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.818
Or any of that.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.186
<i>...Ministers
of the Church...</i>

09:13.220 --> 09:14.755
I have her in hand.

09:14.788 --> 09:16.023
<i>...with true knowledge
and understanding</i>

09:16.056 --> 09:17.224
<i>- of the Word.</i>
- What about them?

09:17.257 --> 09:19.893
We beseech thee
to hear us, O Lord.

09:19.927 --> 09:21.295
What about them?

09:21.328 --> 09:22.963
And that both,
by their preaching...

09:22.996 --> 09:26.800
I can understand why
the Princess Mary is not here.

09:26.833 --> 09:28.035
But the Princess Elizabeth?

09:28.035 --> 09:29.136
We beseech thee
to hear us O Lord.

09:29.136 --> 09:31.972
And my daughter they've
abandoned at home, too, I see.

09:32.005 --> 09:35.175
They're all rather jolly
for the grievously sick.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.843
<i>...and all
the nobility with...</i>

09:36.877 --> 09:38.211
Who's sick?

09:38.245 --> 09:40.314
I thought the Lady Catherine
was meant to be strained

09:40.347 --> 09:42.015
by her pregnancy.

09:42.049 --> 09:44.217
<i>Hence the princess' departure
from her house.</i>

09:45.052 --> 09:47.754
I can't imagine
what the other reason could be.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.256
<i>...to give
all nations unity...</i>

09:49.289 --> 09:51.325
Tongues are wagging.

09:51.358 --> 09:56.029
For the sake or your tongue,
I hope not yours, sir.

09:56.063 --> 09:57.864
- <i>Amen.</i>
- Amen.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.893
Sorry we left you behind, Jane.

10:26.927 --> 10:27.894
<i>It's--</i>

10:27.928 --> 10:28.962
I didn't want to draw attention

10:28.996 --> 10:30.697
to one of our
young female wards,

10:30.731 --> 10:33.367
lest the other one's absence
was noted.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.068
<i>Though it was pointless.</i>

10:35.102 --> 10:38.171
I was asked where Elizabeth was
three times at court.

10:38.205 --> 10:40.374
Shall we go back,
for you were all smiles there?

10:40.407 --> 10:43.377
Seems like you are not
the only convincing actor

10:43.410 --> 10:45.178
in the house then.

10:45.212 --> 10:47.180
<i>Jane, are you acting too?</i>

10:47.214 --> 10:49.116
Do you pretend also
to find him amusing?

10:50.350 --> 10:52.285
And what exactly is it
that you doubt, my lady?

10:53.954 --> 10:55.822
You.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.391
I doubt you.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.162
What would you
have me do?

11:02.195 --> 11:05.799
<i>I would have you
do nothing.</i>

11:05.832 --> 11:10.303
<i>She writes every week,
begging for my forgiveness.</i>

11:10.337 --> 11:11.905
Maybe I should, but...

11:13.940 --> 11:15.742
...I cannot bring myself
to reply.

11:15.776 --> 11:16.943
This is what you have made me.

11:16.977 --> 11:19.413
I've lost all compassion
for a child.

11:19.446 --> 11:21.381
<i>A child, Thomas!</i>

11:22.182 --> 11:25.452
The only person that finds you
remotely worthwhile

11:25.685 --> 11:27.687
is an 11-year-old boy.

11:27.721 --> 11:29.022
Well, he is the king.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.325
An 11-year-old boy.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.829
And me.

11:37.364 --> 11:40.000
How much of a fool am I?

12:06.026 --> 12:08.895
Don't mind Catherine.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.764
Or me, for that matter.

12:13.834 --> 12:18.405
Sometimes things
that seem insurmountable,

12:18.438 --> 12:20.273
they're often resolved quickly.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.743
Mm.

12:23.777 --> 12:26.113
And none of these states
that we find ourselves in

12:26.146 --> 12:30.250
last forever,
be they pleasure or pain.

12:30.283 --> 12:33.520
And yet, Christ is the same
yesterday, today, and forever.

12:35.989 --> 12:37.757
Do you take comfort in that?

12:39.092 --> 12:40.093
I do.

12:46.199 --> 12:49.903
How are you the daughter

12:49.936 --> 12:54.174
of that dilapidated half-wit
Henry?

12:54.207 --> 12:59.179
It's like watching a goshawk
hatch from a goose egg.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.289
Am I to be sent away too?

13:12.392 --> 13:14.394
I thought you were planning
to marry me to the king.

13:14.427 --> 13:18.265
May not be implemented
now that you and Catherine...

13:21.401 --> 13:24.004
...you may no longer
have use of me.

13:24.037 --> 13:27.274
Young Jane...

13:27.307 --> 13:31.211
if you tell Catherine you think
that you have no other use

13:31.244 --> 13:36.049
than as some pawn in a game,
how do you think she'd feel?

13:36.082 --> 13:40.353
Every day she tells me some
clever thing that Jane said

13:40.387 --> 13:44.591
or how elegant Jane grows.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.493
No use of Jane?

13:46.526 --> 13:48.828
No, we got plenty of uses
for you yet.

13:49.362 --> 13:52.832
Um... hmm.

13:52.866 --> 13:55.202
Pot washer?

13:55.235 --> 13:56.937
<i>Nanny goat milker?</i>

13:56.970 --> 13:59.339
Darn my hose,
if all else fails.

13:59.372 --> 14:00.907
<i>Would you like that?</i>

14:06.513 --> 14:09.983
Never forget that you're worth
more than any man

14:10.016 --> 14:12.586
who's lucky enough
to marry you,

14:12.619 --> 14:15.388
be he king or emperor

14:15.422 --> 14:20.160
or... Johnny Guzzlewick
the gardener.

14:52.459 --> 14:55.562
Do you know how much longer
she is to remain here?

14:55.595 --> 14:57.597
For I would like
to one day soon

14:57.631 --> 15:01.301
not have to feed our servants
scraps from our plates.

16:11.071 --> 16:13.039
Don't lose courage now.

16:13.073 --> 16:15.008
I believe
it is only your sister,

16:15.041 --> 16:16.576
and I am sure
she's much more afraid of you

16:16.609 --> 16:19.212
than you of her.

16:19.245 --> 16:20.480
Princess.

16:28.521 --> 16:30.223
This is Sir Pedro.

16:33.326 --> 16:34.361
He is from Spain.

16:56.082 --> 16:58.284
You like apricot?

16:59.619 --> 17:02.122
She's never seen
one of you before.

17:07.026 --> 17:10.397
You've never been to the ports,
the city?

17:10.430 --> 17:13.066
She's never been outside
the grounds of this place.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.071
Out, if you're so afraid of it.

17:18.104 --> 17:19.339
<i>Face it.</i>

17:19.372 --> 17:21.608
- "Him."
- It.

17:21.641 --> 17:23.710
<i>Her fear. Not you.</i>

17:23.743 --> 17:26.112
<i>Why should she
be scared of you, sir?</i>

17:32.218 --> 17:33.753
<i>Leave her be, sir.</i>

17:40.360 --> 17:41.594
Sister.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.438
Do you know
what they say of you?

17:51.471 --> 17:55.175
- No.
- You're already lying to me.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.343
How can I know what
others say when I'm not there?

17:57.377 --> 18:00.246
Of course you can.
Everyone can. Everyone does.

18:02.782 --> 18:05.452
I'm sorry
for the letter I sent.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.220
I'd all but forgot it.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.255
I was caught between
your wishes and Edward's.

18:09.289 --> 18:11.291
And you chose his.

18:11.324 --> 18:13.092
So that is why
you're angry with me.

18:13.126 --> 18:14.294
No, I'm angry
because you have allowed

18:14.327 --> 18:17.363
what I told you would happen
to happen.

18:17.397 --> 18:18.765
I know you think yourself
cleverer than me,

18:18.798 --> 18:20.400
and in truth,
you may well be right.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.868
But even the cleverest
need learn, and for that,

18:22.101 --> 18:24.270
they must listen
to those with experience.

18:24.304 --> 18:26.339
Trust me, sister,
I have plenty.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.550
I wish I had listened;
to you, to Catherine...

18:37.584 --> 18:39.686
Oh, her hand was
well-detectable in that letter.

18:39.719 --> 18:40.854
I sent it
without her knowledge.

18:40.887 --> 18:42.155
You were in her household.

18:42.188 --> 18:43.389
I did much
without her knowledge.

18:43.423 --> 18:44.491
Don't say that.

18:44.524 --> 18:46.626
That's exactly
what they say of you.

18:46.659 --> 18:47.894
But no matter.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.596
That is why I'm here.

18:49.629 --> 18:50.797
You will come with me to court,

18:50.830 --> 18:53.533
and we'll show the lies
for what they are.

18:53.566 --> 18:54.834
No more hiding out here

18:54.868 --> 18:56.769
in the middle of the country
as though in disgrace.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.638
Whose idea was it for you
to come here, of all places?

18:58.671 --> 19:00.707
It was not mine.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.275
- So whose?
- I don't know.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.377
I don't know
who decided it or when,

19:04.410 --> 19:06.579
or whether
I'm even free to leave.

19:06.613 --> 19:08.448
Is Sir Anthony my host
or my jailer?

19:08.481 --> 19:10.917
What was he told?
What does he know?

19:11.150 --> 19:13.686
What on Earth
are you talking about?

19:13.720 --> 19:15.188
What on Earth could he know?

19:28.368 --> 19:29.936
What is there to know?

19:37.744 --> 19:40.246
Don't tell me.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.915
I'll tell you all.

19:41.948 --> 19:43.583
Confide in God and God alone.

19:43.616 --> 19:45.552
He's the only one
you can trust.

19:46.486 --> 19:47.787
Not you?

19:50.223 --> 19:53.393
Others will always seek
to use us.

19:53.426 --> 19:55.695
You, me, and our brother.

19:55.728 --> 19:57.497
They wish us
to fight it out to the death

19:57.530 --> 19:59.666
and hope they're standing
behind a winner at the end.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.768
Don't hand me
the power to destroy you

20:01.801 --> 20:03.570
and then ask me not to use it.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.905
I believe you would resist.

20:07.373 --> 20:10.577
Maybe I'm more like you
than you realize.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.912
I, too, can give in
to temptation.

20:42.375 --> 20:45.011
Be nice to Jane.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.379
- She feels as if--
- <i>What?</i>

20:46.412 --> 20:48.314
Did you try
and fuck her as well?

20:48.348 --> 20:50.817
You trying to stuff your wad
into every young purse

20:50.850 --> 20:52.585
with a claim to the throne?

21:02.662 --> 21:05.431
I hate this.

21:06.399 --> 21:08.301
<i>I hate this.</i>

21:10.036 --> 21:13.940
It's like watching
a Greek tragedy.

21:13.973 --> 21:16.609
The ending foretold
from the start.

21:19.012 --> 21:21.280
But I didn't think
it would come so soon,

21:21.314 --> 21:23.416
not before the milk had soured.

21:28.021 --> 21:32.759
And I never envisaged
it would be with her.

21:34.460 --> 21:36.729
<i>Or that it would hurt
this much.</i>

21:45.071 --> 21:48.574
I won't let you ruin this.

21:48.608 --> 21:50.877
For either of us.

21:50.910 --> 21:53.312
I've had enough of this--
of this unhappiness.

21:53.346 --> 21:54.681
Have you?
That's good to know.

21:54.714 --> 21:58.718
Don't make my generosity
feel like surrender.

21:58.751 --> 21:59.719
I give you this.

21:59.752 --> 22:03.389
I am giving you forgiveness.

22:05.725 --> 22:07.927
I want it.

22:07.960 --> 22:12.799
Please, God,
Catherine, I want it.

22:15.735 --> 22:19.005
Oh, you small man.

22:19.038 --> 22:20.506
Don't.

22:24.610 --> 22:26.746
Let me think you small.

22:28.648 --> 22:31.651
It is better
than what I feared you are.

22:31.684 --> 22:34.487
What I fear you are.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.422
You are my man.

22:36.456 --> 22:38.091
My man.

22:40.526 --> 22:43.563
My small...

22:43.596 --> 22:46.833
small man.

23:13.926 --> 23:16.162
Is he pleased to know
that I am here?

23:16.395 --> 23:18.865
He was surprised,
but not unhappily so.

23:26.439 --> 23:27.874
Brother.

23:27.907 --> 23:31.878
I do not want this.
Us, at war.

23:31.911 --> 23:34.447
You, me, and our sister,
we are on the same side.

23:34.480 --> 23:36.415
Elizabeth has abandoned us.

23:36.449 --> 23:38.651
Leaves Chelsea
and has not been seen since.

23:38.684 --> 23:40.486
- They say she's been unwell.
- <i>But I've seen her.</i>

23:40.520 --> 23:43.089
She's not in some kind of
hiding, whatever rumors there--

23:43.122 --> 23:45.124
I told Your Grace
not to listen to court gossip.

23:45.158 --> 23:47.160
Why has any been allowed
to start with?

23:50.930 --> 23:52.999
I haven't come
to speak of Elizabeth.

23:53.032 --> 23:54.934
<i>I haven't come
to fight with you.</i>

23:59.038 --> 24:01.874
Let's do something
that we enjoy.

24:01.908 --> 24:03.943
Well...

24:03.976 --> 24:05.812
we should think of something.

24:11.751 --> 24:14.754
Go! Come on! Come on!

24:14.787 --> 24:16.122
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

24:19.158 --> 24:20.493
Come on!

24:20.526 --> 24:23.863
- Come on!
- Let's go! Come on!

24:23.896 --> 24:25.698
Yes! Just smash him!

24:25.731 --> 24:27.633
Go for the eyes! The eyes!

24:27.667 --> 24:29.969
<i>Yes!</i>

24:30.903 --> 24:33.005
She lives a quiet life.

24:33.039 --> 24:34.907
She eats. She talks.

24:34.941 --> 24:38.744
How much do I owe you
for this insight?

24:38.778 --> 24:40.479
She's an honest woman.

24:40.513 --> 24:43.583
Her honesty
has never been the problem.

24:43.616 --> 24:45.484
It's her faith that is.

24:45.518 --> 24:48.087
And her deep desire
to parade it.

24:48.120 --> 24:49.555
Oh!

24:49.589 --> 24:50.957
<i>Has the bishop
been attempting</i>

24:50.990 --> 24:53.726
to incite any more
Catholic rebellions with her?

24:54.894 --> 24:56.262
It was not an incitation.

24:56.495 --> 24:58.631
That's not how
your letter made it sound.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.067
Yes!

25:01.100 --> 25:02.668
He promised me
that he'd cause no more--

25:02.702 --> 25:05.271
Do you dislike people
not keeping their promises?

25:06.706 --> 25:08.875
Why are the churches
stripped on your orders?

25:10.509 --> 25:11.644
You promised my role with Mary

25:11.677 --> 25:13.212
was to help end
this religious divide.

25:13.246 --> 25:15.715
Your role
is to be in my employment.

25:15.748 --> 25:19.585
That is not a role, sir,
but a decision of mine.

25:19.619 --> 25:21.020
Well, feel free
to make a different one,

25:21.053 --> 25:23.089
but she won't pay you
to spy on her.

25:23.122 --> 25:25.625
Come on! Pluck his eyes out!

25:25.658 --> 25:28.227
You saw how they resist
funding the Scottish wars.

25:28.261 --> 25:31.731
Those churches
are lined with gold.

25:31.764 --> 25:33.532
You want to fight a war
with God's money

25:33.566 --> 25:34.734
and other people's blood?

25:34.767 --> 25:36.569
I'd happily fight it
with my own blood.

25:36.602 --> 25:38.004
It's down here that's
gonna be the death of me.

25:38.037 --> 25:41.641
Do you fight for your god, sir?
Or yourself?

25:43.009 --> 25:44.577
I fight for the king.

25:44.610 --> 25:47.179
And who do you believe
that is right now?

25:51.851 --> 25:54.921
Yes! Yes!

25:54.954 --> 25:57.323
Useless capon.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.892
Win!

26:25.584 --> 26:28.220
There's been enough gossip
flapping around your house

26:28.254 --> 26:30.690
that it took flight
and reached mine.

26:32.291 --> 26:33.759
What happened, Catherine?

26:35.194 --> 26:36.329
Do you know what they do

26:36.362 --> 26:38.698
to women in the villages
who gossip, Mary?

26:38.731 --> 26:40.733
They bind their mouths.

26:40.766 --> 26:43.903
Perhaps I suggest it
to your brother, the king.

26:45.371 --> 26:47.173
Are you so very proud
of your own actions

26:47.206 --> 26:48.808
that you present
this face to me?

26:48.841 --> 26:50.242
Have you spoken to your sister?

26:50.276 --> 26:51.644
What did she say?

26:51.677 --> 26:53.279
I'm not here to report
my sister's words to you.

26:53.312 --> 26:55.281
I'm here to speak
my own, Mother.

26:58.384 --> 27:00.820
It was a great surprise to me

27:00.853 --> 27:02.355
to learn that you can't
muzzle your hound.

27:02.388 --> 27:04.991
You've muzzled worse,
I thought.

27:05.024 --> 27:07.860
But I suppose that's
when you used your head.

27:07.893 --> 27:10.629
Now you seem to be governed
by something else.

27:10.663 --> 27:12.999
It is called a heart, Mary.

27:13.032 --> 27:14.734
And what a fool
it's made of you.

27:16.002 --> 27:20.773
After all that you have been
through, all that I have seen

27:20.806 --> 27:24.777
and admired, you chose that?

27:24.810 --> 27:27.413
At least I chose him,
rather than was chosen.

27:27.646 --> 27:31.217
I will call that victory
in this life.

27:31.250 --> 27:34.220
And weak or foolish

27:34.253 --> 27:36.922
or judged as I am by you,

27:36.956 --> 27:40.826
I will continue on
and be happy.

27:40.860 --> 27:44.263
No matter the cost,
in spite of others' misery.

27:45.798 --> 27:47.199
I thought
a great many things of you,

27:47.233 --> 27:49.668
but negligence
was never one of them.

27:51.270 --> 27:53.339
You thought many things?

27:53.372 --> 27:56.342
I respected you.

27:56.375 --> 27:58.744
And then I loved you.

28:00.913 --> 28:02.381
And then I hated you.

28:02.415 --> 28:05.051
And I came here
hating you still.

28:05.084 --> 28:07.753
<i>But now...</i>

28:07.787 --> 28:10.423
now I pity you.

28:10.456 --> 28:12.992
Oh.

28:29.308 --> 28:30.476
What did she say?

28:38.350 --> 28:40.252
Come.

28:50.496 --> 28:52.164
I see Mary's back in favor.

28:52.198 --> 28:54.300
How are we meant to keep up?

28:54.333 --> 28:55.734
Catherine and Thomas still in,

28:55.768 --> 28:57.069
or should I be getting Jane
out of there?

28:57.103 --> 28:58.904
I thought everyone's feelings
on this Jane scheme

28:58.938 --> 29:00.106
had been made quite clear.

29:00.139 --> 29:01.941
Well, I see the king,
it seems, has chosen

29:01.974 --> 29:04.276
Thomas and Catherine
over his own sister.

29:04.310 --> 29:07.012
Wh-where is the- the sickly
whore's daughter?

29:07.046 --> 29:09.482
- Close your mouth, Grey.
- What, boy?

29:09.515 --> 29:10.783
Close yours, Rob.

29:10.816 --> 29:12.051
He's talking
about the princess!

29:12.084 --> 29:15.154
And you're talking
to a fucking duke, boy.

29:15.187 --> 29:16.922
So I will speak how I like.

29:16.956 --> 29:18.824
She is the whore's daughter.

29:18.858 --> 29:21.327
If I want, I will call her
a whore myself.

29:22.895 --> 29:25.364
<i>Little lad's full of fire!</i>

29:25.397 --> 29:29.001
Might want to douse
his ardent flames.

29:29.034 --> 29:30.369
Out.

29:30.402 --> 29:32.538
They'd cut off your right hand
if you'd done that.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.907
- Yes, but he didn't.
- Thank God.

29:36.008 --> 29:39.111
I'll wager you'll be needing
yours for some time yet.

29:43.149 --> 29:44.250
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

29:44.283 --> 29:46.285
Get out before he changes
his fucking mind.

29:51.557 --> 29:52.992
I knew your mother
from childhood.

29:53.025 --> 29:54.894
- I know.
- I love your mother.

29:54.927 --> 29:56.262
Not many in court
do their wives.

29:56.295 --> 29:57.496
But Lord, if she'd been
a Princess of England--

29:57.530 --> 29:58.998
What? No!
I don't--I don't think--

29:59.031 --> 30:00.533
You may think that because
I'm a powerful man,

30:00.566 --> 30:02.268
you're protected,
and in a steady world,

30:02.301 --> 30:05.504
that would be true,
but this world rocks.

30:05.538 --> 30:07.439
You're young enough
to think heartbreak romantic--

30:07.473 --> 30:08.807
it is not.

30:08.841 --> 30:10.309
I have said no word
of feelings for her.

30:10.342 --> 30:12.845
This is your own fiction, father.

30:35.201 --> 30:36.902
They said
I might find you here.

30:39.438 --> 30:41.240
Why have you come?

30:41.273 --> 30:44.109
I thought you might like
a visit from a friend.

30:44.143 --> 30:45.377
<i>I can turn back if you wish.</i>

30:45.411 --> 30:47.513
What made you think
I was in need of friendship?

30:49.448 --> 30:51.250
Maybe it's I who's in need.

30:59.592 --> 31:01.927
I cannot.

31:05.197 --> 31:06.298
I cannot.

31:10.336 --> 31:11.470
I cannot.

31:11.503 --> 31:13.472
All your fine tutors
of Latin and Greek,

31:13.505 --> 31:14.873
yet no one taught you this?

31:14.907 --> 31:17.243
There is much I'm yet
to learn, it would seem.

31:17.276 --> 31:19.979
Well, no one could expect you
to know everything.

31:22.948 --> 31:26.885
Except the difference
between right and wrong.

31:31.457 --> 31:33.892
Do they talk about me in court?

31:33.926 --> 31:35.995
They are far too busy
talking of Lord Somerset

31:36.028 --> 31:37.296
and his failing war,

31:37.329 --> 31:38.964
and whether the cockfight
was rigged.

31:38.998 --> 31:41.200
Mainly the cockfight, though,
truth be told.

31:43.002 --> 31:44.503
So I'm forgotten.

31:46.138 --> 31:48.440
Definitely not forgotten.

31:55.581 --> 31:56.682
You wouldn't
look at me like that

31:56.915 --> 31:58.517
if you knew what I had done.

31:59.518 --> 32:01.320
Whatever's occurred,
I doubt all blame

32:01.353 --> 32:03.222
can lie with you alone.

32:03.255 --> 32:04.456
No?

32:06.025 --> 32:07.926
No.

32:28.347 --> 32:30.249
Shit.

32:33.285 --> 32:34.453
Thank you--

33:13.525 --> 33:15.461
I knew you were late.

33:15.494 --> 33:17.329
I know you are taken to drama,
my lady,

33:17.363 --> 33:19.164
but you could have spared it
on this one occasion.

33:19.198 --> 33:20.366
That is unfair.

33:20.399 --> 33:21.633
"Unfair"?

33:21.667 --> 33:25.104
I have written to Catherine
near every week.

33:25.137 --> 33:26.638
That's why I kept asking
Sir Anthony

33:26.672 --> 33:28.440
if there's been word from her.

33:29.708 --> 33:32.578
I've asked her for forgiveness
again and again.

33:32.611 --> 33:34.580
You think you deserve it?

33:56.802 --> 34:00.205
You wish to show me
what, exactly?

34:05.344 --> 34:07.312
The statues.

34:07.346 --> 34:08.714
The gold from the chantry.

34:08.747 --> 34:10.349
The chantry?

34:11.750 --> 34:16.321
"Filthy fucking Catholic,"
they said.

34:24.196 --> 34:26.598
The Lord sees
all you do for him.

34:41.213 --> 34:45.083
He does not need the Lord
to acknowledge his persecution.

34:45.117 --> 34:46.518
He needs an advocate
here on Earth.

34:46.552 --> 34:50.088
- The Lord Protector swore--
- Don't trust the man.

34:51.690 --> 34:53.725
Don't trust these men.

34:54.660 --> 34:57.496
They do not act like you do.

34:57.529 --> 34:59.765
They do not act
with conscience.

34:59.798 --> 35:01.300
He tells your brother
all of this

35:01.333 --> 35:03.235
is in the name of reform,

35:03.268 --> 35:05.571
but he robs from us
to line his own pockets

35:05.604 --> 35:07.773
and fund a godless war.

35:09.508 --> 35:11.243
You are the only player
in this game

35:11.276 --> 35:12.678
worrying about the rules.

35:32.197 --> 35:33.332
Oh!

36:10.936 --> 36:13.872
She's more than I deserve.

36:13.906 --> 36:16.542
That's for God to decide.

36:20.579 --> 36:23.215
I fear I'm too much of a sinner

36:23.248 --> 36:25.817
to give myself up
to His will completely.

36:27.219 --> 36:29.521
Maybe you're a better man
than you think.

36:29.555 --> 36:31.723
<i>You coming in?</i>

36:50.776 --> 36:52.377
Hey.

36:59.484 --> 37:02.387
No more.

37:02.421 --> 37:03.922
<i>Of before.</i>

37:06.358 --> 37:07.526
I promise.

37:08.860 --> 37:11.663
I don't want your promise.

37:11.697 --> 37:13.231
I don't need it.

37:16.835 --> 37:19.605
Perhaps no one will understand
my marriage to you.

37:22.007 --> 37:23.442
I certainly don't.

37:23.475 --> 37:26.712
But I speak to you,
and you answer.

37:26.745 --> 37:28.480
I ask you to do things.

37:28.513 --> 37:32.651
Sometimes you do,
sometimes you don't...

37:32.684 --> 37:34.853
but you do at least listen.

37:35.954 --> 37:38.790
To my thoughts,
to my decisions.

37:40.425 --> 37:42.961
- As if you were a man.
- Indeed.

37:44.496 --> 37:46.999
As if I were a person.

37:58.310 --> 38:00.045
I look at mine,

38:00.278 --> 38:02.514
and I-I want to squeeze
their little faces!

38:02.547 --> 38:03.882
Other times,

38:03.915 --> 38:06.852
the troublesome wenches
are begging for a slap.

38:06.885 --> 38:10.422
But even then, even then,
it is with love.

38:10.455 --> 38:13.659
- Oh! With love!
- With love!

38:13.692 --> 38:15.460
With love!

38:15.494 --> 38:18.296
But don't be afraid to be
a bastard to them, Thomas.

38:18.330 --> 38:19.931
Yes. With love.

38:19.965 --> 38:22.934
- Admonishing.
- Admonishing.

38:22.968 --> 38:25.871
<i>Good advice.</i>

38:41.553 --> 38:43.689
- Sir?
- <i>Jane.</i>

38:43.722 --> 38:45.023
Sir Thomas?

38:45.057 --> 38:46.525
You're gonna wake the babe.

38:46.558 --> 38:48.427
Sir Thomas. My lord.
My lord, please.

38:48.460 --> 38:50.362
I'm just gonna go look at her.

38:50.395 --> 38:51.963
Wait, Sir Thomas--

38:51.997 --> 38:54.466
Sir.

38:54.499 --> 38:57.636
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

39:06.845 --> 39:08.346
Catherine?

39:10.615 --> 39:11.983
Catherine?

39:30.836 --> 39:32.971
Hush now, my child.

39:46.518 --> 39:47.519
My lord.

39:57.529 --> 40:00.031
Finally, sir.
You kept me waiting.

40:01.800 --> 40:02.968
I received a message.

40:03.001 --> 40:05.170
Your messages are not
as important as mine.

40:05.403 --> 40:07.806
I received this,
Lord Protector.

40:07.839 --> 40:09.508
An invitation to the wedding

40:09.541 --> 40:12.844
of Mary Queen of Scots
and the Dauphin of France.

40:12.878 --> 40:14.112
<i>They send me this!</i>

40:14.146 --> 40:18.784
She was meant to be my wife,
and the war still rages!

40:18.817 --> 40:20.752
<i>When will the humiliation
you have put me</i>

40:20.786 --> 40:22.654
<i>and this country through end?</i>

40:22.687 --> 40:24.890
They--they should not
have sent this.

40:25.857 --> 40:27.159
And that's all you have to say?

40:30.128 --> 40:33.632
No. Catherine Parr is dead.

40:37.669 --> 40:39.538
<i>Childbed fever.</i>

40:42.874 --> 40:43.975
I'm not sure.

40:47.879 --> 40:49.881
<i>God's will.</i>

40:53.618 --> 40:56.555
Her possessions are
to be returned to the crown.

40:57.589 --> 41:00.692
<i>And so the crown has decided
Chelsea Place is to go to you,</i>

41:00.725 --> 41:02.594
<i>along with a great many
other things.</i>

41:03.895 --> 41:06.898
You are of age, and there's
no one left to claim you.

41:09.501 --> 41:11.736
You are rich.

41:11.770 --> 41:13.238
In fact,
the only woman in the country

41:13.471 --> 41:15.774
with more wealth and influence
is your sister.

41:16.842 --> 41:18.877
<i>I am to escort you
as soon as you are ready</i>

41:18.910 --> 41:20.979
<i>to take up residence.</i>

41:21.012 --> 41:24.049
- With whom?
- With yourself.

41:26.985 --> 41:29.254
You will have advisors
and counselors aplenty.

41:29.487 --> 41:32.757
Useless pissants to a man.

41:32.791 --> 41:34.559
But I'm sure
you're quite capable

41:34.593 --> 41:37.562
of making your own decisions.

41:47.005 --> 41:48.874
Henry!

41:54.079 --> 41:56.915
You didn't think
she could stay, did you?

42:01.286 --> 42:02.988
In the carriage.

42:31.650 --> 42:34.986
He didn't...

42:35.020 --> 42:37.289
with you?

42:37.322 --> 42:38.323
There was no...

42:41.860 --> 42:42.861
Good.

42:46.831 --> 42:50.101
Good. On!

42:50.135 --> 42:52.304
<i>Come on! Come on.</i>

43:17.929 --> 43:21.366
You're to come and stay
with me, Thomas.

43:21.599 --> 43:23.835
Try not to argue, sir.

43:23.868 --> 43:26.104
It won't change anything.

43:26.137 --> 43:27.772
Not a boy
and a dead wife.

43:27.806 --> 43:29.207
I've thoroughly failed
this assignment.

43:29.240 --> 43:30.642
You must be immensely pleased.

43:30.675 --> 43:32.377
Don't be stupid.

43:39.084 --> 43:43.188
I sat downstairs, and...

43:43.221 --> 43:46.224
I waited for life, but...

43:50.729 --> 43:54.065
...my mind,
it wandered to her death.

43:54.099 --> 43:56.234
Maybe...

43:56.267 --> 43:58.703
maybe I brought it into being.

44:00.372 --> 44:04.776
When our children were born,

44:04.809 --> 44:06.644
I believe I did that.

44:08.213 --> 44:09.748
A little.

44:11.049 --> 44:13.318
Ready oneself, in case.

44:16.388 --> 44:17.989
I think it natural.

44:19.357 --> 44:21.359
Catherine seemed well.

44:21.993 --> 44:23.128
<i>Yes.</i>

44:25.063 --> 44:27.432
As our sister did.

44:27.665 --> 44:29.234
<i>Yeah.</i>

44:29.267 --> 44:31.269
There were
but 12 days in this world

44:31.302 --> 44:34.973
where there was both
our sister and her son in it.

44:35.006 --> 44:36.408
I look at Edward now,

44:36.441 --> 44:38.810
and though I know
I'm his uncle,

44:38.843 --> 44:43.114
I--I clear forget that--

44:43.148 --> 44:45.150
<i>that she bore a son at all.</i>

44:45.183 --> 44:48.019
No, I see her
in the king sometimes.

44:50.855 --> 44:53.391
It takes me quite by surprise,
but I do.

44:55.894 --> 44:57.695
From time to time.

44:57.729 --> 45:00.865
I just see the boy as he is.

45:00.899 --> 45:02.834
Or I see Henry fucking Tudor.

45:03.968 --> 45:06.004
That is uncanny.

45:06.037 --> 45:07.939
The old cunt
back from the dead,

45:07.972 --> 45:10.075
possessing him
to stamp his feet.

45:10.108 --> 45:11.443
Thomas.

45:13.411 --> 45:16.114
No, but as God persecutes me,

45:16.147 --> 45:18.083
I think his greatest trick...

45:20.185 --> 45:23.788
...is that he leaves you
still well alone.

45:23.822 --> 45:26.257
Perhaps it's so that I can
always see when I'm denied.

45:26.291 --> 45:29.060
God doesn't play tricks.

45:29.094 --> 45:30.795
On you.

45:30.829 --> 45:33.231
For the world,
it parts and it bows

45:33.264 --> 45:37.268
as you move through it,
while I struggle uphill,

45:37.302 --> 45:39.070
and as soon as I get anywhere,
in God steps

45:39.104 --> 45:41.039
just to push me
back down again.

45:44.175 --> 45:46.845
What amuses you so, sir?

45:46.878 --> 45:48.513
My dead wife?

45:48.746 --> 45:49.514
My motherless child?

45:49.747 --> 45:50.748
Or my cursed life?

45:50.782 --> 45:51.950
No, I'm- I'm not amused.

45:51.983 --> 45:53.151
I'm just--
I'm a little in wonder

45:53.184 --> 45:54.752
at how you see things.

45:54.786 --> 45:56.154
Your view out
onto the world, Thomas,

45:56.187 --> 45:57.288
is a little different

45:57.322 --> 45:58.890
from the one
that the rest of us have.

45:58.923 --> 46:01.392
So you think
I'm not uniquely tortured.

46:01.426 --> 46:02.894
First our sister,

46:02.927 --> 46:04.395
then my wife,

46:04.429 --> 46:07.532
taken just
as everything seemed--

46:07.765 --> 46:08.867
everything seemed well.

46:08.900 --> 46:11.336
Our sister saw her son,
the future king,

46:11.369 --> 46:13.404
carried by us
ahead of the whole court

46:13.438 --> 46:15.073
to his christening.

46:15.106 --> 46:16.374
Would she not have
wanted that day?

46:16.407 --> 46:20.245
Catherine held her daughter,
not in panic or in pain.

46:20.278 --> 46:22.780
She held and kissed her baby

46:22.814 --> 46:25.550
thinking that both were safe.

46:25.783 --> 46:27.785
<i>God stayed his hand
to bless them</i>

46:27.819 --> 46:28.920
<i>by gifting them those days.</i>

46:28.953 --> 46:29.988
You wouldn't wish them away

46:30.021 --> 46:33.558
because it would
ease your suffering.

46:33.791 --> 46:35.293
I would.

46:36.995 --> 46:38.830
I do not like suffering.

48:18.162 --> 48:20.198
Ladies, let's unpack.

49:19.190 --> 49:21.693
We're about to start.

49:21.726 --> 49:24.028
Didn't know where you'd gone.

49:24.062 --> 49:26.164
A mass for Catherine Parr?

49:27.298 --> 49:30.001
She was my friend once.

49:30.568 --> 49:32.603
You pray for your enemies?

49:34.605 --> 49:37.008
For all.

49:37.975 --> 49:40.111
Pray for me, then.

49:44.649 --> 49:46.150
Sir?

49:48.553 --> 49:51.456
The Lord Protector sent me
to spy on you.

49:54.025 --> 49:56.728
Tempting you with morsels
to keep you quiet

49:56.761 --> 49:59.630
whilst he runs wild.

49:59.664 --> 50:02.066
He wants power over you
and your brother.

50:08.005 --> 50:11.008
Why are you
telling me this now,

50:11.042 --> 50:12.643
that you have betrayed me?

50:12.677 --> 50:14.412
I've spent my whole life
waiting for men

50:14.445 --> 50:17.515
to prove themselves honorable.

50:17.548 --> 50:19.450
But no matter how decent
or pious,

50:19.484 --> 50:21.753
they all had their price.

50:21.786 --> 50:25.523
It's how I- I justified
becoming a mercenary.

50:25.556 --> 50:28.326
Because I was no worse
than any other man.

50:28.359 --> 50:31.028
Better, in fact, because I,
at least, was honest.

50:34.065 --> 50:36.067
And then I met you.

50:38.536 --> 50:40.738
And I'm beginning to see
that perhaps I...

50:43.141 --> 50:44.542
I was wrong.

50:49.814 --> 50:52.183
I suppose you're
in a hurry to return to court

50:52.216 --> 50:54.685
now that you're
finally back here.

50:54.719 --> 50:57.255
I have no desire
to be at court.

50:58.456 --> 51:01.225
Then what do you want,
Lady Elizabeth?

51:05.129 --> 51:06.264
I don't know.

51:06.297 --> 51:07.732
Of course you do.
All women do.

51:07.765 --> 51:10.368
You're just trained
to disguise it.

51:10.401 --> 51:14.405
Ambition is much-admired
in men but derided in women.

51:14.439 --> 51:16.641
But what do you want?

51:16.674 --> 51:18.109
It will indeed serve you

51:18.142 --> 51:20.077
to hide what you want
from others,

51:20.111 --> 51:22.246
but do not keep it
from yourself.

51:26.417 --> 51:29.253
Your father didn't
give a fuck about rumors,

51:29.287 --> 51:31.422
but if you do,
they should be stopped.

51:31.456 --> 51:33.558
The Lord Protector
should have done so.

51:33.591 --> 51:35.293
If they have reached
the Lord Protector,

51:35.326 --> 51:36.661
I doubt he has believed them,

51:36.694 --> 51:41.332
or any have, else there
would have been consequence.

51:41.365 --> 51:42.633
There was.

51:42.667 --> 51:45.870
I am no consequence,
Princess, believe me.

51:46.103 --> 51:48.339
But still people chatter.

51:48.372 --> 51:49.607
And however false,

51:49.640 --> 51:51.709
<i>how can I control
what others say of me?</i>

51:51.742 --> 51:52.743
Oh, you can.

51:52.777 --> 51:57.315
Lord, of course
you fucking can.

52:08.559 --> 52:11.262
You know how much this will
stoke the fires at court.

52:12.230 --> 52:13.731
Let them burn.

52:48.499 --> 52:50.167
Princess.

52:54.872 --> 52:56.541
Lord Dudley.

53:01.479 --> 53:06.284
Let my brother know I am here
and would like an audience.

53:27.738 --> 53:29.574
Your Majesty.

53:36.380 --> 53:38.983
I come before you
with a confession.

53:43.888 --> 53:48.526
I have been selfish and naive,

53:48.559 --> 53:50.261
and I have wronged you.

53:50.895 --> 53:52.997
Why say you this, sister?

53:53.230 --> 53:55.866
I've neglected my duties.

53:55.900 --> 53:58.235
<i>Our Lady Catherine
was blessed with child,</i>

53:58.269 --> 54:00.705
<i>so I took myself to Cheshunt
for her confinement</i>

54:00.738 --> 54:02.540
<i>and was then myself taken ill.</i>

54:03.641 --> 54:05.676
Illness is no excuse.

54:05.710 --> 54:07.244
Duty is more important.

54:07.278 --> 54:09.380
Duty to God and duty to you.

54:09.413 --> 54:11.415
I am your servant.

54:21.626 --> 54:25.630
I know some have speculated
on the reasons for my absence.

54:27.431 --> 54:30.768
I am here to show
that there is no need.

54:32.470 --> 54:35.673
And I offer myself to you, brother.

54:38.376 --> 54:41.445
I am yours,

54:41.479 --> 54:43.514
and yours alone.

55:12.043 --> 55:14.645
Stand, sister.

55:21.419 --> 55:25.022
The crown forgives your absence

55:25.056 --> 55:26.957
and welcomes your return.

55:35.433 --> 55:37.702
Let us have music.

55:37.735 --> 55:39.570
Let us celebrate this.

55:50.114 --> 55:53.117
A fine rehabilitation.

55:53.350 --> 55:55.453
That would be to return
as I once was.

55:55.486 --> 55:57.054
That girl was a fool.

55:57.088 --> 55:58.789
That girl is dead.

56:10.935 --> 56:12.103
<i>Ready?</i>

56:14.739 --> 56:17.141
Marry me.

56:17.374 --> 56:18.509
<i>Play.</i>
