00:00.583 --> 00:02.377
[woman]
Riverdale...

00:02.419 --> 00:04.713
You know what
I think, carrottop?

00:04.754 --> 00:07.298
I think you've got
a hero complex.

00:07.340 --> 00:08.258
Who is Julian?

00:08.299 --> 00:10.844
Julian was to be your triplet.

00:10.885 --> 00:13.972
You had absorbed the third one.

00:14.014 --> 00:17.392
The spirit of Julian
is haunting Thistlehouse?

00:17.434 --> 00:19.310
What other explanation
could there possibly be?

00:19.352 --> 00:20.061
Now that
the trials are over,

00:20.103 --> 00:23.189
I think it's time to let
bygones be bygones.

00:23.231 --> 00:25.900
Veronica, I have invited
your father back.

00:25.942 --> 00:27.318
I can't believe you.

00:27.360 --> 00:28.570
We were done with him.

00:28.611 --> 00:30.155
I wanted to ask you
about Grandpa.

00:30.196 --> 00:31.197
Did you know
he was a writer?

00:31.239 --> 00:33.158
My old man wasn't a writer.

00:33.199 --> 00:35.660
He was a mean... mean drunk.

00:35.702 --> 00:38.913
You two were trying
to cover up something
about Mr. Chipping's suicide.

00:38.955 --> 00:39.664
It wasn't murder.

00:39.706 --> 00:42.333
You were there, Jones,
no one pushed him
out that window.

00:42.375 --> 00:43.376
What is this?

00:43.418 --> 00:45.170
Six hours of our house.

00:45.211 --> 00:46.171
Why would somebody do that?

00:46.171 --> 00:48.923
Film it, and then leave
the evidence on
the front doorstep?

00:51.176 --> 00:54.262
After a brief hiatus,
Riverdale's Watcher
in the 'burbs

00:54.304 --> 00:57.891
had released
his much-anticipated follow up.

00:57.932 --> 00:58.600
In the dead of night,

00:58.641 --> 01:01.144
a second round
of voyeuristic videotapes

01:01.186 --> 01:03.605
had been left
on doorsteps across town.

01:04.980 --> 01:09.277
Once again, VCRs
were dusted off with dread.

01:09.319 --> 01:14.074
And once again, they played
hours upon hours of footage

01:14.115 --> 01:14.866
of the viewers' home.

01:14.866 --> 01:20.205
Only this time, the camera
was much, much closer.

01:20.246 --> 01:22.332
The implications
were terrifying.

01:22.373 --> 01:26.044
What was next for the Watcher?
Breaking and entering?

01:26.086 --> 01:28.213
And as if those deliveries
weren't unsettling enough,

01:28.254 --> 01:28.963
colleges and universities

01:29.005 --> 01:32.383
had started sending out
their first wave of envelopes.

01:32.425 --> 01:34.886
Some thin, some thick.

01:34.928 --> 01:37.597
All life-changing.

01:37.639 --> 01:40.100
Making it a particularly
stressful time

01:40.141 --> 01:41.184
for Riverdale High seniors.

01:41.226 --> 01:45.105
Which is why Principal Honey
asked the school's
guidance counselor,

01:45.146 --> 01:49.109
Mrs. Burble, to offer
extended office hours.

01:49.150 --> 01:51.236
So whatever anxiety
the students were feeling,

01:51.277 --> 01:53.404
they'd have a licensed
professional to go to

01:53.446 --> 01:55.698
for confidential comfort
and/or advice.

01:57.158 --> 01:58.910
Something, it turned out,

01:58.952 --> 02:00.995
many of us
were long overdue for.

02:01.037 --> 02:03.456
Hey, Mom. I'm gonna
make some Highpoint.

02:03.498 --> 02:04.541
Do you want any?

02:09.753 --> 02:10.420
What's wrong?
Is everything okay?

02:10.420 --> 02:15.552
You were so sweet when
you were little, Elizabeth.

02:15.593 --> 02:18.179
So innocent.
When did you become a liar?

02:18.221 --> 02:19.264
What are you talking about?

02:22.934 --> 02:24.602
"Dear, Ms. Elizabeth Cooper,

02:24.644 --> 02:28.106
after careful review of your
Early Action application,

02:28.148 --> 02:30.150
the Admissions Committee
regrets to inform you

02:30.191 --> 02:32.944
that we are unable
to offer you a place

02:32.986 --> 02:35.029
at Yale University."

02:36.281 --> 02:37.448
I didn't get in?

02:38.324 --> 02:39.993
Wait. You opened my mail?

02:40.034 --> 02:40.660
I thought to myself,

02:40.660 --> 02:43.705
"How could my Betty
get rejected from college?

02:43.746 --> 02:45.623
What has her so unfocused

02:45.665 --> 02:47.625
that it cost her her future?"

02:47.667 --> 02:49.377
-So, I searched your bedroom.
-You did what?

02:49.419 --> 02:50.044
And do you know what I found

02:50.044 --> 02:52.589
hidden in the false bottom
of your night stand?

02:54.632 --> 02:55.675
Oh, my God, Mom!

02:55.717 --> 02:57.093
You should be studying.

02:57.135 --> 02:58.595
You should be focused.

02:58.636 --> 03:00.221
Instead, you are
out of control.

03:00.263 --> 03:02.390
Okay, that's it.
This is the last straw.

03:02.432 --> 03:03.975
We are not discussing this.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.310
We are not discussing anything.

03:05.351 --> 03:07.187
You and I
are not on speaking terms.

03:07.228 --> 03:10.148
You have been invading
my privacy for years.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.399
And it's over.

03:12.859 --> 03:13.818
[Betty knocking on door]

03:14.861 --> 03:16.237
Mrs. Burble,
do you have a minute?

03:16.279 --> 03:17.655
Mmm... Yes.

03:17.697 --> 03:20.074
Ms. Cooper,
come on in, please.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.410
Mmm. Skit-Skat?

03:22.452 --> 03:24.078
Oh. No, thanks.

03:25.747 --> 03:28.166
Um... I have a sweet tooth.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.126
So, how can I be of help?

03:33.296 --> 03:33.963
Mom?

03:33.963 --> 03:36.716
Oh, we're in the middle
of a session, Mrs. Cooper.

03:36.758 --> 03:37.717
It's Ms. Smith.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.177
So you're
stalking me now, too?

03:39.219 --> 03:40.762
Shocking as it
may seem, Betty,

03:40.803 --> 03:41.387
I didn't know
that you would be here.

03:41.387 --> 03:44.390
I came down
to talk to Mrs. Burble myself.

03:44.432 --> 03:46.601
To see if she could give me
any insight on how to...

03:47.060 --> 03:47.560
talk to you.

03:47.560 --> 03:50.271
This. This is what's
bothering me.

03:50.313 --> 03:53.566
Her control-complex.
Her insane overreactions.

03:53.608 --> 03:54.484
This is my problem.

03:54.525 --> 03:55.944
No. What her problem is,

03:55.985 --> 03:57.528
is that she's been
rejected from college,

03:57.570 --> 03:59.364
because she's too busy
having sex.

03:59.405 --> 04:02.659
Is that what you associate
with sexuality, Ms. Smith?

04:02.700 --> 04:04.661
-Shortcomings?
-Excuse me, Ms. Burble,

04:04.702 --> 04:07.247
I must have missed
your doctorate on the wall

04:07.288 --> 04:08.665
because I don't need
a therapist.

04:08.706 --> 04:11.793
Licensed psychologist,
actually.

04:11.834 --> 04:14.003
What Betty needs
is an intervention

04:14.045 --> 04:18.048
for this irresponsible
disregard for her future.

04:18.091 --> 04:18.632
Oh, that's interesting.

04:18.632 --> 04:20.760
I was gonna say that
there were months,

04:20.802 --> 04:22.262
or actually years,

04:22.303 --> 04:24.847
worth of psychotic
parenting to unpack.

04:24.889 --> 04:27.392
-Oh.
-Clearly, there are
a lot of feelings here.

04:28.434 --> 04:29.936
Betty,

04:29.978 --> 04:32.563
would it be okay with you
if your mother joined us.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.983
Even if I said no,
she would stay anyways.

04:37.318 --> 04:38.361
[sighs]

04:38.861 --> 04:39.821
Betty.

04:41.656 --> 04:43.491
Do you hide things
from your mother?

04:44.742 --> 04:46.828
Well, yeah.

04:46.869 --> 04:49.998
Of course.
Everyone does, but...

04:50.039 --> 04:52.333
-I mean, I learned
from the best.
-Oh.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.460
So you feel she keeps
secrets from you, too?

04:54.502 --> 04:56.587
Since, literally,
the day I was born.

04:56.629 --> 04:58.673
Only when it's
in her best interest.

04:58.715 --> 05:01.175
Oh, oh,
so you joining a cult,

05:01.217 --> 05:03.219
that was in my best interest?

05:03.261 --> 05:03.928
Not mentioning to me

05:03.970 --> 05:06.597
that you weren't actually
brainwashed the whole time,

05:06.639 --> 05:08.683
you were just
undercover with the FBI,

05:08.725 --> 05:10.768
working with my
long-lost half-brother

05:10.810 --> 05:13.646
who I thought was dead,
that was in my best interest?

05:13.688 --> 05:15.773
You're a child.
I was protecting you.

05:15.815 --> 05:16.399
Then explain how giving away

05:16.441 --> 05:18.651
my college fund to the Farm
was part of that.

05:18.693 --> 05:21.070
That was before, when I was
under the influence of Edgar.

05:21.112 --> 05:22.613
How about
when you didn't tell me

05:22.655 --> 05:24.240
that I had
the serial killer genes?

05:24.282 --> 05:24.824
Or when you had Polly

05:24.866 --> 05:27.285
committed to
The Sisters of Quiet Mercy,

05:27.327 --> 05:29.620
and didn't tell me
where she was?

05:29.662 --> 05:33.541
Or when you had me dragged off
to that evil-nun-hell-hole?

05:33.583 --> 05:34.208
Because she did, Mrs. Burble,

05:34.208 --> 05:37.545
where they force-fed me
drugs against my will.

05:37.587 --> 05:40.298
But, hey, but, hey.
You know, at least
they were Fizzle Rocks,

05:40.340 --> 05:43.259
-and not birth-control
because God forbid!
-Context is important here.

05:43.301 --> 05:44.635
-Context.
-Did you ever realize
that maybe

05:44.677 --> 05:45.345
I started taking birth-control

05:45.345 --> 05:48.348
because I didn't wanna
have a baby at 16 like you?

05:48.389 --> 05:51.017
Or Polly? I didn't wanna be
like the two of you,

05:51.059 --> 05:53.561
pregnant and married
to a murderer,

05:53.603 --> 05:55.021
or a cult-leader, or both?

05:55.063 --> 05:57.440
I'd hoped I'd raised you
to be smarter than us.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.817
And no offense, Mom, I am.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.903
Being proactive
is being smart.

06:01.944 --> 06:03.613
And you're acting so naive,

06:03.654 --> 06:05.823
like you didn't think
I was having sex.

06:05.865 --> 06:07.784
Jughead and I sleep
in the same bed.

06:07.825 --> 06:09.619
[Alice] She's too young
to have sex.

06:09.660 --> 06:11.496
She doesn't know
what's good for her.

06:11.537 --> 06:13.373
You are so hypocritical.

06:13.414 --> 06:15.833
I was fine
taking care of myself

06:15.875 --> 06:18.503
when you abandoned me
for the Farm.

06:18.544 --> 06:20.588
Yet you keep
treating me like a child.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.256
Oh, so that's a crime now?

06:22.298 --> 06:24.175
A mother wanting
to protect her child.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.344
You've said that
several times now.

06:26.386 --> 06:29.347
Betty's young.
Betty is a child.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.515
Why do you think that is?

06:30.556 --> 06:32.975
She is! Uh... [stuttering]

06:33.017 --> 06:34.685
Look, it's fine for me.

06:34.727 --> 06:36.479
I take her insults.

06:36.521 --> 06:38.689
That's my cross to bear
as a parent.

06:38.731 --> 06:40.817
But the things that
she's written in her diaries...

06:40.858 --> 06:42.235
You read her diaries?

06:42.276 --> 06:44.362
Yes, because she has
no boundaries.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.947
No emotional respect. None.

06:45.988 --> 06:47.490
How does that make you feel?

06:47.532 --> 06:50.493
Like I'm filled
with gunpowder,

06:50.535 --> 06:54.038
and I'm one Elizabeth away
from exploding.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.165
You need to stop
invading my privacy,

06:56.207 --> 06:59.419
and accept the fact
that I'm becoming an adult.

07:01.754 --> 07:04.048
You will always be
my daughter, Elizabeth.

07:05.341 --> 07:08.052
And I am so,
so worried about you.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.888
-But not for
the right reasons, Mom.
-Wha...

07:10.930 --> 07:14.142
Forget about college, sex,
and the serial killer genes.

07:14.183 --> 07:17.728
Think about everything
that you have done to me.

07:17.770 --> 07:21.232
That is what I'm going
to be unpacking
for the rest of my life.

07:22.567 --> 07:24.485
So you either...

07:24.527 --> 07:26.154
start treating me
like I'm an adult,

07:26.195 --> 07:27.572
or I will not be in your life.

07:28.656 --> 07:31.325
Ms. Smith, Betty's education,

07:31.367 --> 07:34.078
her relationship,
her behavior...

07:34.120 --> 07:36.956
I think those things
make you afraid.

07:36.998 --> 07:39.625
Afraid that Betty
is growing up.

07:39.667 --> 07:42.587
That may even be why you
gave away her college money,

07:42.628 --> 07:44.714
because if you can control her,

07:44.755 --> 07:48.551
you can hold on
to her childhood
just a little bit longer.

07:49.218 --> 07:50.803
Does that sound right?

07:51.596 --> 07:52.930
It's just...

07:55.099 --> 07:57.268
I've already lost two children.

07:58.519 --> 08:00.188
First Charles.

08:00.897 --> 08:03.191
Then Polly. And Betty...

08:04.859 --> 08:07.987
growing up,
leaving for college,

08:08.029 --> 08:09.947
moving out, moving on.

08:09.989 --> 08:11.616
It just feels like
I'm losing you, too.

08:11.657 --> 08:13.868
-Mom!
-[crying]

08:13.910 --> 08:15.495
That's what happens.

08:16.579 --> 08:18.956
Kids grow up and they leave.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.252
I can't be your only... hope.

08:25.463 --> 08:26.923
But I love you.

08:26.964 --> 08:30.218
I love you, too,
but that is not an apology.

08:32.303 --> 08:32.970
That does not justify

08:32.970 --> 08:36.890
the horrible, unhealthy things
that you have done.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.893
How you keep suffocating me.

08:38.934 --> 08:41.479
And why me? Why are you
doing this to me?

08:41.520 --> 08:42.563
Because I love you.

08:42.605 --> 08:45.191
But you love Polly, too.

08:45.233 --> 08:48.069
She's in an asylum.
She needs you.
She needs help.

08:48.110 --> 08:49.987
So why can't you
go do this to her?

08:50.029 --> 08:52.198
Because I love you more.
[sobs]

08:52.240 --> 08:53.533
I love you most.

08:57.119 --> 08:58.246
[sobs]

09:16.305 --> 09:18.391
Newton's Laws of Motion...

09:18.432 --> 09:20.268
Now, who can tell me...

09:23.145 --> 09:24.313
[Kevin] Archie.

09:25.064 --> 09:26.148
Archie.

09:26.774 --> 09:27.775
Archie.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.906
I'm so sorry, Dr. Phylum.

09:33.948 --> 09:35.491
Save it for Mrs. Burble.

09:35.533 --> 09:37.743
I'm not interested
in your explanations.

09:37.785 --> 09:41.289
I'm really sorry, Ms. Burble.
I've been having...

09:41.330 --> 09:42.790
trouble sleeping, lately.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.208
Maybe it's like insomnia.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.376
Oh, it's okay, Archie.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.712
I'm not here to reprimand you.

09:47.753 --> 09:49.422
I just wanna talk.

09:49.463 --> 09:50.047
Oh, okay.

09:50.047 --> 09:53.801
-What about?
-Well, for starters, college.

09:53.843 --> 09:54.969
You haven't applied to any.

09:55.011 --> 09:57.555
Yeah, I... I'm not
really interested.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.724
I'm needed here in Riverdale.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.642
To take over
Andrews Construction?

10:01.684 --> 10:03.436
No. To clean up the town.

10:04.645 --> 10:05.980
Someone needs to step up.

10:06.022 --> 10:06.564
Like my dad would've.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.942
He spent his whole life
helping people.

10:09.984 --> 10:11.319
Can we talk about him
for a second?

10:13.529 --> 10:15.156
How are you managing?

10:15.197 --> 10:17.074
I try to carry on his legacy.

10:17.116 --> 10:18.784
You've already done
so much good.

10:18.826 --> 10:22.955
You opened up
a center for at-risk kids.

10:22.997 --> 10:25.249
-That's not enough.
-Why would you think that?

10:25.291 --> 10:27.918
Ever since I started
trying to help people,

10:27.960 --> 10:29.253
things have gotten complicated.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.757
I've messed things up
and I have to fix it,

10:32.798 --> 10:34.383
-so no one else gets hurt.
-Hurt?

10:35.676 --> 10:36.719
Archie...

10:37.386 --> 10:38.763
I have to tell you.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.599
If you admit to a crime,

10:41.641 --> 10:45.061
or tell me that
you're putting yourself
or anyone else in danger,

10:45.102 --> 10:46.437
I'm required to report it.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.356
-I'm fine.
-Are you?

10:48.397 --> 10:52.234
Because you've missed
a lot of football,
where you excelled.

10:52.276 --> 10:56.197
And those cuts and bruises
on your hands
are not from sports.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.035
The truth is...

11:04.872 --> 11:05.331
I go out at night.

11:05.331 --> 11:07.541
You mean cruising
in Fox Forest?

11:07.583 --> 11:09.877
What? No.
I don't mean that. [scoffs]

11:09.919 --> 11:11.045
I...

11:12.046 --> 11:13.547
I put on a mask,

11:14.924 --> 11:17.218
and I try to...

11:18.844 --> 11:19.970
help people.

11:20.012 --> 11:21.222
I'm not sure I follow.

11:21.263 --> 11:24.141
I'm a big comic book fan.
Mr. Justice,

11:24.183 --> 11:25.726
the Comet, the Red Circle...

11:25.768 --> 11:27.687
I really identify
with them, you know?

11:27.728 --> 11:29.605
Are you saying...

11:29.647 --> 11:31.816
that you're having fantasies...

11:33.025 --> 11:35.152
about acting like these
comic book heroes?

11:35.194 --> 11:38.322
Exactly. Like there's
this dealer, Dodger,

11:38.364 --> 11:41.158
he uses kids to do
his dirty work.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.285
Kids. And the police
can't do anything.

11:43.327 --> 11:44.578
So someone else
has to stop him.

11:44.620 --> 11:46.414
-Yes.
-To protect the community.

11:46.455 --> 11:47.707
-Yes.
-A vigilante.

11:49.041 --> 11:50.751
-No.
-Who protects a vigilante?

11:50.793 --> 11:51.836
Who cares?

11:51.877 --> 11:52.545
I don't read
a lot of comic books,

11:52.586 --> 11:56.173
but doesn't the hero
usually suffer a great tragedy,

11:56.215 --> 11:59.343
and then create their persona
out of rage? Is that right?

11:59.385 --> 11:59.844
I guess so.

11:59.844 --> 12:02.096
Doesn't that
resonate with you?

12:02.138 --> 12:03.681
Because everything
that you've told me

12:03.723 --> 12:07.727
feels like it could be fueled
by grief-induced anger--

12:07.768 --> 12:10.062
Like I said, Ms. Burble,
I just-- I'm just
trying to help.

12:10.104 --> 12:12.940
But to do it safely,
we have to acknowledge

12:12.982 --> 12:15.860
-and work on the anger.
-Why?

12:15.901 --> 12:18.946
I know I'm angry, Ms. Burble.
I'm not an idiot.

12:18.988 --> 12:21.365
Look at all the crappy things
that have happened to me,

12:21.407 --> 12:26.120
to my friends, to my dad.
They make me angry.

12:26.912 --> 12:28.372
You...

12:28.414 --> 12:30.916
talking to me like I'm a moron,
that makes me angry.

12:30.958 --> 12:33.169
-Understandably.
-And it hurts.

12:34.754 --> 12:38.215
I hurt... all the time.

12:38.257 --> 12:40.926
And all I wanna do
is make sure no one else does.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.681
But I've screwed it up.
[crying]

12:45.723 --> 12:50.019
My mom almost got shot
in the drive-by.

12:50.060 --> 12:52.354
She was held at gunpoint
on Thanksgiving.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.316
How is a guy supposed to...

12:56.317 --> 12:57.151
to clean up the town,

12:57.193 --> 13:00.821
and protect his loved ones
if he's putting them
in the crosshairs?

13:03.657 --> 13:05.534
So what am I supposed to do?

13:07.787 --> 13:08.954
Huh?

13:10.956 --> 13:12.249
"Theoretically"?

13:17.254 --> 13:19.423
The behavior
you're discussing

13:19.465 --> 13:21.091
sounds like an addiction.

13:21.133 --> 13:22.468
No, it's not.

13:22.510 --> 13:23.969
Isn't it?

13:24.011 --> 13:26.347
You're aware
of negative consequences,

13:26.388 --> 13:28.057
but you're compelled anyway.

13:29.099 --> 13:31.393
That's compulsive behavior.

13:31.435 --> 13:32.770
[sniffles]

13:32.812 --> 13:34.438
Forget me going out at night.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.317
Just running the center
has made me a target.

13:38.359 --> 13:39.902
Yeah, but you keep at it.

13:41.070 --> 13:43.489
It's the appropriate
and smarter way

13:43.531 --> 13:46.450
to channel your anger
and help those in need.

13:46.492 --> 13:47.785
It feels like it's not enough.

13:47.827 --> 13:51.038
Then why not enlist
more volunteers?

13:51.080 --> 13:54.416
Like me. Or you can start
an anonymous tip line

13:54.458 --> 13:56.043
to give you farther reach,

13:56.085 --> 13:58.212
so those people who are
scared to talk to the police

13:58.254 --> 14:00.339
can report things.

14:00.381 --> 14:03.217
But I can't
stress this enough, Archie.

14:03.259 --> 14:05.135
Do not go out at night.

14:06.345 --> 14:07.847
You could get hurt.

14:07.888 --> 14:10.808
Your loved ones could get hurt.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.726
Mom, can we talk?

14:12.768 --> 14:14.228
Oh, boy. What's wrong?

14:17.898 --> 14:20.818
I don't wanna give up
on my work
at the community center.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.279
Yeah, I know. I've made
my peace with that.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.739
Yeah. But I can't keep
putting you in danger.

14:25.781 --> 14:27.658
Dodger and his family
are still out there,

14:27.700 --> 14:29.410
and sooner or later
they'll come after me.

14:29.451 --> 14:30.536
So...

14:32.246 --> 14:33.998
I'm moving out.

14:34.039 --> 14:35.499
-Archie, no.
-Mom,

14:35.541 --> 14:37.167
you don't have a choice.

14:37.209 --> 14:39.587
I'm 18. I'm an adult.

14:39.628 --> 14:41.547
I'm gonna move into the center,

14:41.589 --> 14:44.049
just for a while
until Sheriff Jones
catches Dodger

14:44.091 --> 14:45.217
and things cool off
for a bit.

14:45.259 --> 14:46.677
Archie, you don't
have to do this.

14:46.719 --> 14:49.388
Yes, I do.
Their war's with me,
not with you.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.351
It's okay. I'll be okay.

14:55.644 --> 14:56.687
[sighs]

15:19.501 --> 15:21.420
You've reached
the Riverdale Hotline.

15:21.462 --> 15:24.715
If you wish to report
a problem in your neighborhood,
leave a message.

15:24.757 --> 15:27.384
Anonymity's your choice.
We're here to help.

15:27.426 --> 15:29.261
And remember...

15:29.303 --> 15:30.763
you're not alone.

16:06.298 --> 16:07.883
[school bell rings]

16:09.176 --> 16:09.885
[Ms. Bell over PA]
Cheryl Blossom,

16:09.885 --> 16:13.222
please report
to Principal Honey's office.

16:13.263 --> 16:15.933
And the war
of the red roses
rages on.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.977
Good luck, babe.

16:18.018 --> 16:21.397
So, wherefore are we
rattling sabers today,
Principal Honey?

16:21.438 --> 16:24.566
Ms. Blossom, do you know
how many absences
you've had this semester?

16:24.608 --> 16:26.694
-Twenty-six.
-Need I remind you

16:26.735 --> 16:28.654
and the sorry lot of yams
you call educators,

16:28.696 --> 16:32.449
that I have suffered
numerous family deaths.

16:32.491 --> 16:33.659
My mother disappeared,

16:33.701 --> 16:35.744
I am raising twin toddlers,

16:35.786 --> 16:37.705
and I am the sole
caregiver for my Nana.

16:37.746 --> 16:40.416
Yeah, well, it is for
those reasons that I have

16:40.457 --> 16:43.669
decided to put
a certified adult in charge
of the cheerleading squad.

16:43.711 --> 16:45.838
Pause.

16:45.879 --> 16:47.548
You're taking my Vixens
away from me?

16:47.589 --> 16:50.050
Hmm. I'll tell you what.

16:51.385 --> 16:53.637
I will let Mrs. Burble
interview you

16:53.679 --> 16:55.139
and make a recommendation.

16:55.180 --> 16:58.225
But if she deems you
psychologically unfit,

16:58.267 --> 16:59.643
it's over.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.819
So, Cheryl, would you
like a Three Buccaneers?

17:09.862 --> 17:11.864
I don't eat nougat,
I don't take bribes,

17:11.905 --> 17:14.616
and I don't talk
to trade-school flunkies
about my feelings.

17:14.657 --> 17:17.661
You know, Cheryl,
the only way you're gonna
get what you want,

17:17.703 --> 17:20.289
your Vixens back,
is if you talk to me...

17:20.748 --> 17:21.707
about you.

17:21.749 --> 17:23.333
Okay, then.

17:23.375 --> 17:24.960
I have a rapturous girlfriend,

17:25.002 --> 17:28.380
total independence, a 4.0,
and amazing hair.

17:28.422 --> 17:29.923
-Are we done?
-Not quite.

17:30.716 --> 17:31.884
Did you receive a videotape?

17:33.343 --> 17:34.595
How'd it make you feel?

17:34.636 --> 17:35.387
[scoffs] Please.

17:35.429 --> 17:38.849
I have felled multiple villains
with my bow over the years.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.976
I'm not afraid
of some sad AV pervert

17:41.018 --> 17:42.895
with a camcorder
older than your blazer.

17:42.936 --> 17:46.315
Speaking of the last few years,
have you ever spoken

17:46.356 --> 17:49.276
to a professional about
everything you've been through?

17:49.318 --> 17:51.570
Your mother's abuse,
your brother's murder,

17:51.612 --> 17:53.405
your father's suicide,

17:53.447 --> 17:55.949
your time
in conversion therapy,

17:55.991 --> 17:59.453
and an organ harvesting cult,

17:59.495 --> 18:01.371
your near-death experience
in Sweetwater River--

18:01.413 --> 18:02.289
That was an accident.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.252
It would be okay
if you told me it wasn't.

18:08.837 --> 18:12.633
Cheryl, you've endured
lifetimes of trauma.

18:12.674 --> 18:16.220
I can't imagine going through
a single one, much less all.

18:16.261 --> 18:19.473
And as a teenager,
unimaginable.

18:19.515 --> 18:22.059
You are remarkably resilient.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.936
It must be exhausting.

18:26.605 --> 18:27.815
How've you been coping?

18:36.281 --> 18:37.574
I talk to Jason.

18:39.409 --> 18:41.286
I talk to my dead brother.
That's how I cope.

18:41.328 --> 18:43.247
Like prayer.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.999
-That's a very healthy way
of dealing with grief.
-No.

18:46.542 --> 18:47.543
I...

18:48.460 --> 18:50.003
go into the chapel...

18:51.296 --> 18:52.506
in my house...

18:53.507 --> 18:56.176
where my brother's
body is, and...

18:57.261 --> 18:58.804
I talk to him.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.434
And I think he answers me back.

19:08.939 --> 19:10.065
I think...

19:11.150 --> 19:12.359
maybe...

19:13.068 --> 19:15.988
I've lost my mind,
and I don't know
when it happened.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.032
Was it when Jay-Jay died?

19:20.159 --> 19:22.661
Was it when I
fell through the ice?

19:22.703 --> 19:24.830
Have I always been this way...

19:26.623 --> 19:27.833
Fractured?

19:29.835 --> 19:32.546
In the tomb, when you're
speaking with Jason,

19:32.588 --> 19:33.922
how far away are you?

19:33.964 --> 19:35.883
I usually sit across the room.

19:36.508 --> 19:37.050
What does it matter?

19:37.092 --> 19:39.386
Well, what's the difference
between that

19:39.428 --> 19:43.015
and people visiting a gravesite
to talk to their loved ones?

19:43.056 --> 19:45.559
Or people who have
urns on their mantle?

19:46.101 --> 19:47.561
But that ash...

19:48.312 --> 19:50.397
those rotting bodies,

19:51.356 --> 19:52.566
they don't talk back.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.651
I'm not sure Jason does either.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.403
I think you want him to.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.697
But you're not crazy, Cheryl.

19:59.781 --> 20:01.074
You miss your brother.

20:03.493 --> 20:04.328
But missing Jason
doesn't explain

20:04.328 --> 20:08.373
the other goings-on
in the phantasmagory
that is Thistlehouse.

20:08.415 --> 20:10.292
What's happening
in this Thistlehouse?

20:10.334 --> 20:12.753
I'm being haunted by a ghost.

20:12.794 --> 20:14.630
Ghosts don't exist.

20:14.671 --> 20:16.924
Your life may be
defined by gothic tropes,

20:16.965 --> 20:19.134
but you're being
haunted by grief,

20:19.176 --> 20:22.137
by guilt over
your family's misfortune,

20:22.179 --> 20:24.014
-your brother's death--
-Brothers.

20:24.723 --> 20:26.850
-Plural.
-I'm confused.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.310
Is this a metaphorical brother?

20:28.352 --> 20:29.853
No, you mallard.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.480
I had a triplet.

20:31.521 --> 20:33.440
Julian, whom I absorbed
in the womb,

20:33.482 --> 20:34.107
and has resurfaced as a doll

20:34.107 --> 20:36.610
that's moving around my house
causing mischief.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.904
I've thrown him away,
buried him,

20:38.946 --> 20:40.113
encircled him in salts,

20:40.155 --> 20:42.115
and he keeps coming back.

20:42.157 --> 20:45.160
Because he's angry.
He's vengeful.

20:45.202 --> 20:46.620
Julian's driving you insane.

20:46.662 --> 20:48.789
Of course, he's a Blossom.

20:52.918 --> 20:54.086
So... [sniffles]

20:56.922 --> 20:59.466
Do you still maintain
that I'm not mad as a hatter,

20:59.508 --> 21:02.052
even though I'm
talking to taxidermy,

21:02.094 --> 21:03.887
and being
tormented by a devil-doll.

21:03.929 --> 21:06.932
I don't think you're
being haunted, Cheryl.

21:06.974 --> 21:09.142
And I don't think
you've lost your mind.

21:09.184 --> 21:15.065
Then what's wrong
with me? [crying]

21:15.107 --> 21:20.362
I think someone is trying
to make you think
that you've lost your mind.

21:20.404 --> 21:21.738
I think you're being gaslit.

21:22.239 --> 21:23.907
Like...

21:23.949 --> 21:26.660
-Ingrid Bergman?
-In fact, yes.

21:26.702 --> 21:28.745
What sounds
most logical to you?

21:28.787 --> 21:31.206
That the evil spirit
of an absorbed fetus

21:31.248 --> 21:33.667
is inhabiting
an anthropomorphic doll?

21:34.543 --> 21:36.962
Or that a human being

21:37.004 --> 21:40.549
is moving that doll
around your house
when you're not there?

21:40.590 --> 21:42.509
But Julian...

21:42.551 --> 21:45.053
We can find out the truth
about Julian's existence

21:45.095 --> 21:45.762
with a swab of your saliva.

21:45.762 --> 21:49.266
You can't have any of my
bodily fluids, you succubus.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.810
It's for a chimerism lab.

21:51.852 --> 21:55.772
A test that shows
whether a person absorbed
a fetus in the womb

21:55.814 --> 21:59.276
by analyzing if they have

21:59.318 --> 22:01.570
one set of DNA or two.

22:01.611 --> 22:05.240
If I were to guess,
you aren't going
to test positive.

22:05.282 --> 22:08.410
You mean to tell me this test
has existed this whole time?

22:08.452 --> 22:12.122
Mmm-hmm. I'm going to give you
the number of a doctor I know

22:12.998 --> 22:13.707
who can perform the test.

22:13.749 --> 22:16.585
I'll give her a heads up
that she might be
expecting you.

22:17.377 --> 22:18.462
So...

22:19.254 --> 22:20.922
what about my precious Vixens?

22:22.007 --> 22:23.425
Can I keep them?

22:23.467 --> 22:26.219
As a counselor, I think
you've done A-plus work.

22:27.137 --> 22:28.388
As an administrator,

22:29.139 --> 22:31.683
Cheryl, I'm sorry.

22:31.725 --> 22:34.686
I'm going to recommend
to Principal Honey
that he bring in a coach...

22:36.229 --> 22:38.607
to supervise the Vixens

22:38.648 --> 22:40.901
while you focus on you,

22:41.735 --> 22:42.903
for a little while.

22:43.820 --> 22:45.030
[sighs]

22:59.419 --> 23:00.629
[door shuts]

23:04.466 --> 23:05.967
[screams]

23:25.070 --> 23:27.614
can you
come here a minute?

23:36.039 --> 23:37.791
What do you want, Daddy?

23:37.833 --> 23:40.293
To tell me about
another secret love-child?

23:40.335 --> 23:42.504
No, I need your keen eye.

23:42.546 --> 23:44.548
-Is this centered?
-Mmm-hmm.

23:44.589 --> 23:47.217
don't you think?

23:47.592 --> 23:48.885
Hmm.

23:48.927 --> 23:52.264
The first bottle of Lodge Rum
I ever produced.

23:52.305 --> 23:54.307
And second to you

23:54.349 --> 23:57.352
and my diploma
from Harvard University,

23:57.394 --> 23:58.478
my proudest achievement.

23:58.520 --> 23:59.354
I'm late for school.

23:59.354 --> 24:03.191
Oh, speaking of Cambridge,
didn't you apply
to Harvard Early Action?

24:03.984 --> 24:05.360
I should be hearing anon.

24:05.402 --> 24:06.778
-Hmm.
-Now, if you'll excuse me,

24:06.820 --> 24:08.321
Microeconomics
waits for no one.

24:13.243 --> 24:15.162
Game Theory's
all about strategy.

24:15.203 --> 24:16.955
And, yeah, it's big in Econ,

24:16.997 --> 24:19.499
-but it's also been
applied to war--
-[cell phone vibrating]

24:21.460 --> 24:22.919
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
I have to take this.

24:27.132 --> 24:31.261
Good afternoon, Dean Kingsley.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

24:31.303 --> 24:33.430
Ms. Luna, I know
it's unorthodox,

24:33.472 --> 24:35.265
but as Dean of Admissions,

24:35.307 --> 24:37.767
I wanted to give you
a personal heads up.

24:37.809 --> 24:41.813
Congratulations
on your acceptance
to Harvard's class of 2024.

24:43.482 --> 24:44.357
Yes!

24:45.192 --> 24:46.234
Yes!

24:49.988 --> 24:51.740
[exhales]

24:51.781 --> 24:53.950
Thank you so much,
Dean Kingsley.

24:53.992 --> 24:54.784
August can't come soon enough.

24:54.826 --> 24:58.121
Indeed. Now, will you give
my regards to your father,

24:58.163 --> 25:01.374
and please thank him
Veritas.

25:03.210 --> 25:04.211
Son of a--

25:04.252 --> 25:05.712
[Ms. Burble] Butter Flinger?

25:08.340 --> 25:10.258
I think I know why you're here.

25:10.300 --> 25:13.136
Are there any updates
I need to make to your file?

25:13.178 --> 25:15.639
Regarding, say... Harvard?

25:16.932 --> 25:17.807
Oh.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.268
Uh, yes, actually. I got in.

25:20.310 --> 25:21.978
Congratulations, Veronica.

25:22.020 --> 25:24.064
If I'm not mistaken,
that was your dream school.

25:24.105 --> 25:25.232
It was.

25:26.525 --> 25:27.776
Now it's my nightmare.

25:27.817 --> 25:30.070
Aren't you proud of this
milestone achievement?

25:30.111 --> 25:31.947
No, I didn't achieve Harvard.

25:31.988 --> 25:34.282
Once again, my father
meddled in my affairs,

25:34.324 --> 25:36.826
and apparently,
bought my way
into their ivy-covered walls,

25:36.868 --> 25:40.163
with rum, threats,
money, charm, who knows.

25:40.205 --> 25:42.207
It's humiliating
and infuriating.

25:42.249 --> 25:44.668
Infuriating because
he didn't think you can
do it on your own.

25:44.709 --> 25:45.418
No.

25:45.460 --> 25:48.505
Because now, I'll never know
if I could do it on my own.

25:48.547 --> 25:51.800
Is it possible
he was actually
trying to just help?

25:51.841 --> 25:54.511
My father has
a bank vault for a heart.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.054
He did this to prove he can

25:56.096 --> 25:56.930
and always will control me.

25:56.972 --> 26:02.060
And do you feel
this control is him
punishing you for something?

26:02.102 --> 26:05.230
Was King Lear's ego
gossamer thin? Yes.

26:05.272 --> 26:06.481
This is what he does.

26:06.523 --> 26:08.233
He fake-sold me
two businesses,

26:08.275 --> 26:10.902
and then conned me
into running them.

26:10.944 --> 26:12.362
Successfully, might I add.

26:12.404 --> 26:13.196
Then charged me protection.

26:13.196 --> 26:16.658
He lured my boyfriend
into crime, and then
tried to kill him

26:16.700 --> 26:19.619
in front of a crowd
at an illegal boxing match.

26:19.661 --> 26:22.372
He had my mother arrested,
and the piece de resistance,

26:22.414 --> 26:24.374
he brought his
secret illegitimate daughter

26:24.416 --> 26:26.126
back to Riverdale
to try and make me jealous.

26:26.167 --> 26:28.336
Well, blow winds
and crack your cheeks,

26:28.378 --> 26:31.381
because Veronica Luna
is no one's Cordelia.

26:33.675 --> 26:34.801
Are you jealous...

26:35.343 --> 26:36.553
of your sister?

26:36.595 --> 26:38.305
Absolutely not.

26:38.346 --> 26:40.056
She can have him.
They deserve each other.

26:40.098 --> 26:42.058
Yet I'm sensing animosity.

26:42.100 --> 26:44.269
"Sensing"? I despise that man.

26:44.311 --> 26:45.854
I want nothing to do with him.

26:45.895 --> 26:47.480
But you willingly live at home.

26:48.565 --> 26:49.649
Well, yes, but--

26:49.691 --> 26:51.610
You obediently come
when he calls you.

26:51.651 --> 26:54.195
Veronica, I don't think
this is hate.

26:54.237 --> 26:56.072
It's obsession.

26:56.114 --> 26:58.491
You and your father
are obsessed with each other.

26:58.533 --> 27:00.869
You're diagnosing me
with Daddy issues?

27:01.494 --> 27:02.704
How very Intro-to-Psych.

27:02.746 --> 27:06.416
I'm saying, your connection...

27:06.458 --> 27:10.795
goes far beyond that
of a typical father-daughter.

27:10.837 --> 27:13.173
It's primal. Cosmic.

27:13.214 --> 27:16.009
He sees you
as an extension of himself,

27:16.051 --> 27:19.679
which is why he'll
never fully let you go.

27:19.721 --> 27:23.767
And you see him
as your ideal future self.

27:23.808 --> 27:25.769
No, that's baseless.

27:25.810 --> 27:28.063
I have no desire
to become my father.

27:28.104 --> 27:29.397
You're a straight-A student,

27:29.439 --> 27:31.358
you run two
flourishing businesses,

27:31.399 --> 27:33.485
you just got admitted
into Harvard.

27:33.526 --> 27:35.528
I mean, maybe
that's your base resentment.

27:35.570 --> 27:38.573
He is an abjectly bad person.

27:38.615 --> 27:39.866
I have zero respect for him.

27:39.908 --> 27:42.702
And yet he has
instilled in you a drive

27:42.744 --> 27:45.413
that is perhaps the reason
why you are so successful.

27:45.455 --> 27:47.540
He's taken more
than he's ever given.

27:47.582 --> 27:49.668
My old friend Dr. Freud

27:50.251 --> 27:52.337
has two diagnoses

27:52.379 --> 27:55.131
that seem pertinent
to your situation.

27:55.173 --> 27:57.133
The Oedipus
and Electra complexes.

27:57.175 --> 28:00.220
I've always seen the drama
in my life as Shakespearean.

28:00.261 --> 28:01.805
Not the stuff of Greek tragedy.

28:01.846 --> 28:05.183
But please, enlighten me.

28:05.225 --> 28:09.396
You're locked
in a constant battle
for identity with your father.

28:09.437 --> 28:13.316
You're driven by
compulsive forces like love,

28:13.358 --> 28:15.402
sexuality, obsession.

28:15.443 --> 28:17.696
I'm not stabbing
my eyes out for any man.

28:17.737 --> 28:19.614
Acknowledging that
the tether exists

28:19.656 --> 28:21.491
is the first step
towards breaking it.

28:21.533 --> 28:24.661
Electra murdered Agamemnon.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.121
What are you saying,
Mrs. Burble?

28:26.162 --> 28:28.498
Obviously, I'm
not suggesting murder.

28:28.540 --> 28:31.543
But rather, to cut ties
with him for good.

28:31.584 --> 28:33.670
He's trolling you.

28:33.712 --> 28:34.754
So why not ghost him?

28:34.796 --> 28:36.339
No offense,

28:36.381 --> 28:39.426
Mrs. Burble,
but your "teen-speak"

28:39.467 --> 28:40.844
could use an update.

28:40.885 --> 28:42.512
As could your advice.

28:42.554 --> 28:43.221
I've tried that repeatedly.

28:43.263 --> 28:46.933
Well, it only works if you
actually want to walk away.

28:47.934 --> 28:48.893
Do you?

28:51.229 --> 28:52.731
Yes.

28:52.772 --> 28:56.151
Well, obviously, I think
you should say yes to Harvard.

28:56.192 --> 28:57.569
But moving forward,

28:57.610 --> 29:00.113
I recommend
that no matter what,

29:00.155 --> 29:03.241
you do not engage
with your father on his terms.

29:03.283 --> 29:04.033
You may be his hubris,

29:04.033 --> 29:08.246
but he can't be yours,
or else he will be
your downfall.

29:08.288 --> 29:12.000
I really, really
wanna go to Harvard.

29:14.836 --> 29:18.465
You're locked
in a dance of death
with your father, Veronica.

29:20.175 --> 29:22.469
So my last question is this.

29:23.678 --> 29:24.679
Who's leading?

29:25.305 --> 29:27.724
Him or you?

29:37.609 --> 29:39.194
[Francis] You're late.

29:39.235 --> 29:40.570
Apparently,
I'm not the only one.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.071
Don't we have
a seminar today?

29:42.113 --> 29:44.532
I dismissed the others
to continue writing.

29:45.450 --> 29:47.076
You haven't even started.

29:47.118 --> 29:49.746
Yeah, okay. I know I was
supposed to turn in
pages this week.

29:49.788 --> 29:52.415
You were offered
an opportunity here, Mr. Jones.

29:52.457 --> 29:54.459
Frankly, you have
squandered it.

29:54.501 --> 29:57.086
I've been told you haven't even
applied to any colleges yet.

29:57.128 --> 29:58.588
Okay, I'm sorry.

29:58.630 --> 30:00.757
My plate's been stacked.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.509
I can still apply
for regular admission.

30:02.550 --> 30:04.511
And yet I can't imagine
any teachers here

30:04.552 --> 30:06.221
writing a letter
of recommendation

30:06.262 --> 30:08.389
for such an apathetic student.

30:08.431 --> 30:10.266
You might wanna
beg the indulgences

30:10.308 --> 30:12.560
of your teachers
at your public alma mater,

30:12.602 --> 30:15.188
vis-a-vis your
future matriculations.

30:22.237 --> 30:24.656
How long does it usually
take to get a transcript?

30:26.199 --> 30:29.118
I'm sure Ms. Bell is
going as fast as she can.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.412
But while we wait, why don't we
just have a little chat?

30:31.454 --> 30:33.331
Uh... no.

30:33.373 --> 30:36.626
I have a hard
Holden-Caulfield stance
on phony small-talk. Thanks.

30:36.668 --> 30:40.129
Do you often use
fictional references to make
sense of your situation?

30:40.171 --> 30:42.215
Yes. Yes, I do.

30:42.257 --> 30:45.134
I heard about
your teacher, Mr. Chipping.

30:45.176 --> 30:48.221
Public suicide,
that's, uh, tragic.

30:48.263 --> 30:52.475
He didn't kill himself.
He was murdered,
by suicide, I guess.

30:52.517 --> 30:54.727
-Who knows
what they're capable of?
-Who?

30:54.769 --> 30:57.564
Uh, DuPont. And the students.
They convinced him to jump.

30:57.605 --> 30:59.566
Because I'm on the cusp
of bringing down their empire.

30:59.607 --> 31:01.860
-Which empire?
-Baxter Brothers.

31:03.570 --> 31:04.988
My grandfather created them.

31:05.029 --> 31:07.156
As in
inspired the characters?

31:07.198 --> 31:09.200
No. As in he wrote
the first book.

31:09.242 --> 31:12.245
And then DuPont
stole the franchise out
from under him.

31:12.287 --> 31:14.998
Now, he's got us competing
to ghostwrite the next one.

31:15.039 --> 31:16.958
But what's the point?
It's rigged.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.836
He's a thief. And he has
a grudge against anyone
with the name Forsythe.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.254
Starting with my grandfather,
the first.

31:23.214 --> 31:27.176
Or you have
a persecution complex.

31:27.218 --> 31:30.263
Are you paranoid,
chasing windmills?

31:30.305 --> 31:32.515
So you have a reasonable excuse

31:32.557 --> 31:35.351
to neglect your
real work, writing?

31:35.393 --> 31:38.146
Oh, is that your advice
after everything I just said?

31:38.187 --> 31:40.231
-Just, "Do your homework, kid."
-Well, I'm wondering

31:40.273 --> 31:42.275
if the real reason
why you're so focused

31:42.317 --> 31:43.735
on proving that
the Baxter Brothers

31:43.776 --> 31:45.320
belongs to your family

31:45.361 --> 31:46.779
is because you're afraid.

31:46.821 --> 31:49.449
Are you insecure about
your own talent as a writer?

31:49.490 --> 31:50.325
I'm not gonna be psychoanalyzed

31:50.325 --> 31:53.244
by someone who
doesn't know the phrase
"tilting at windmills."

31:53.286 --> 31:54.120
It's about recognition.

31:54.120 --> 31:58.207
It's about
not letting some ascot steal
my family's achievements.

31:58.249 --> 32:00.126
You know, my grandfather
could've been Gatsby-rich.

32:00.168 --> 32:01.878
You know what he was instead?

32:01.920 --> 32:04.672
He was a mean drunk
who beat my father
in a trailer.

32:04.714 --> 32:06.424
But from what
you're describing,

32:06.466 --> 32:07.133
this investigation

32:07.175 --> 32:10.970
is trying to get those
very things you claim to hate.

32:11.012 --> 32:13.556
An inheritance,
status, prestige.

32:14.432 --> 32:15.600
I'm not trying to be like them.

32:15.642 --> 32:18.436
No, clearly.
Better not to try at all.

32:18.478 --> 32:21.689
Fulfil their expectation
that you're a bum,

32:21.731 --> 32:23.566
then claim that they
didn't give you a chance.

32:23.608 --> 32:25.401
That is the easy path.

32:25.443 --> 32:28.404
Now, your father,
on the other hand,

32:28.446 --> 32:29.906
he took a harder one.

32:29.948 --> 32:33.493
Good. The designated
dad-part of this lecture.

32:33.534 --> 32:34.953
He's a Sheriff now.

32:34.994 --> 32:36.955
Came from a poor household

32:36.996 --> 32:41.626
with an abusive father,
and did the work
to transform himself.

32:41.668 --> 32:45.254
And sacrificed,
so you could succeed.

32:45.296 --> 32:47.966
I bet he was very supportive
of you going to Stonewall Prep.

32:49.384 --> 32:50.843
Yeah, practically
dragged me there.

32:50.885 --> 32:53.554
And you repay him by
going on this quest to prove

32:53.596 --> 32:55.682
that the man that caused him
immeasurable pain

32:55.723 --> 32:57.642
is some kind of wronged hero.

32:57.684 --> 32:59.852
How do you think
that makes him feel?

33:02.355 --> 33:05.400
Maybe instead
of lionizing your grandfather,

33:07.610 --> 33:10.405
you should try seeing him
through your father's eyes.

33:14.659 --> 33:17.286
I won't think
you less smart if...

33:17.328 --> 33:18.955
you admit that I'm right.

33:21.124 --> 33:22.291
You're right.

33:24.752 --> 33:26.045
My poor dad.

33:27.630 --> 33:28.506
[exclaims]

33:32.552 --> 33:33.803
I'm so selfish.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.513
No.

33:35.555 --> 33:38.016
You're just a high school
senior from Riverdale.

33:39.434 --> 33:40.393
You're busy.

33:44.564 --> 33:45.982
Maybe I should...

33:48.943 --> 33:51.070
put down
the conspiracy theories
and just do my homework.

33:54.115 --> 33:55.199
You're underpaid, aren't you?

33:55.241 --> 33:56.451
And overqualified.

33:58.286 --> 34:01.706
Which means
I don't expect anyone
to change habits overnight.

34:01.748 --> 34:03.624
If you're going
to see this mystery

34:03.666 --> 34:06.586
about the Baxter Brothers'
authorship through,

34:06.627 --> 34:10.255
then don't fall back on
conjecture or righteous anger.

34:10.297 --> 34:12.257
Do the work.
You know,

34:12.842 --> 34:13.926
investigate.

34:17.804 --> 34:21.266
Now let's see
where those transcripts are.

34:21.309 --> 34:24.437
Oh, and just...
take the rest of it.
You're my last one today.

34:32.195 --> 34:35.531
Hey, boy. I've missed
seeing you around the house,

34:35.572 --> 34:37.366
typing away on that thing--

34:39.619 --> 34:41.579
Whoa... what's all this?

34:43.915 --> 34:47.502
I love you. And I
appreciate everything
that you've done for me. I...

34:48.418 --> 34:49.795
I don't think
I say that enough.

35:14.112 --> 35:16.322
Elizabeth, perfect timing.
The boys are out back,

35:16.364 --> 35:18.741
and the casserole's
almost ready. Set the table?

35:22.495 --> 35:25.206
Why are you looking
at me like that?
Come on. Chip chop.

36:02.326 --> 36:04.495
I love you most, too, Mom.

36:11.335 --> 36:12.628
[sighs]

36:15.256 --> 36:16.799
[answering machine beeps]

36:27.226 --> 36:27.935
[beeps]

36:27.977 --> 36:30.980
Hi, um, my name is...
I don't wanna say.

36:31.022 --> 36:33.816
But I live in the
apartment building at the
north end of Sketch Alley,

36:33.858 --> 36:37.445
and the man
who lives down the hall,
I think he hits my mom.

36:37.486 --> 36:39.447
I think she needs help.

36:39.488 --> 36:42.074
Please, I need help.

37:03.095 --> 37:05.514
[sighs] T.T., I got my results.

37:05.556 --> 37:08.184
From Highsmith College?
I thought you were
already accepted.

37:08.226 --> 37:11.604
No, silly lovebug.
My chimerism test results.

37:11.646 --> 37:14.315
Promise me, no matter what
the contents of this envelope,
you're here for me.

37:14.357 --> 37:16.400
Cheryl, I have no idea
what you're talking about,

37:16.442 --> 37:18.694
but I love you,
and nothing
would ever change that.

37:32.917 --> 37:34.794
Negative. [exclaims] Negative!

37:34.835 --> 37:38.172
T.T., I'm 100%
Cheryl Marjorie Blossom.

37:38.214 --> 37:41.217
Babe, I love seeing you
this happy, but what
does that mean?

37:41.259 --> 37:43.761
It means that Burble was right.

37:43.803 --> 37:46.639
Fact. I'm not crazy.
I'm not haunted.

37:46.681 --> 37:49.308
Maybe there once was a Julian
in my mother's mortal womb,

37:49.350 --> 37:51.227
but I didn't absorb him.

37:51.269 --> 37:52.019
That's amazing.

37:52.061 --> 37:56.274
But how do we
explain the weirdness
around Thistlehouse?

37:56.315 --> 37:58.526
Mrs. B enlightened me
to the realization

37:58.567 --> 38:01.153
that most likely
someone is trying
to drive me mad.

38:01.195 --> 38:04.198
But once I find out
who this depraved monster is,

38:04.240 --> 38:06.492
I will unleash a wrath
upon them so wicked,

38:06.534 --> 38:09.495
they will wish they
had been consumed
in their mother's womb.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.622
[Hiram] Veronica!

38:15.084 --> 38:15.626
What's the matter, Daddy?

38:15.626 --> 38:18.337
Why did I get a call
from Dean Kingsley

38:18.379 --> 38:22.008
informing me that
you turned down
your acceptance to Harvard?

38:22.049 --> 38:23.843
Please tell me
he's sorely mistaken.

38:23.884 --> 38:25.136
There has been no mistake.

38:25.177 --> 38:26.762
I won't be a crimson come fall.

38:26.804 --> 38:29.598
Besides, I look better
in Yale blue, anyway.

38:29.640 --> 38:32.184
Oh! Are you insane?

38:33.060 --> 38:35.896
No one rejects Harvard.

38:35.938 --> 38:37.982
-It was your dream.
-One of my dreams.

38:38.024 --> 38:40.860
Yes. But then you
ruined it for me.

38:40.901 --> 38:43.029
Walking through
those ivory towers,

38:43.070 --> 38:46.699
I'd be letting you dictate
the rest of my life.

38:46.741 --> 38:49.535
I'd graduate,
get my MBA from Oxford,

38:49.577 --> 38:52.955
run a Fortune 500,
Fibes,
obviously.

38:52.997 --> 38:56.792
The next 20 years
would be mapped out by you.

38:56.834 --> 39:00.004
I'm finished living
your version of my life.

39:00.046 --> 39:02.173
You don't get to own my future.

39:02.214 --> 39:05.051
So consider
the ties that bind... cut.

39:06.927 --> 39:10.514
Really? And what do you think
mija?

39:10.556 --> 39:12.975
Walk away from me? [chuckles]

39:13.017 --> 39:14.810
You've never
been able to do that.

39:16.854 --> 39:19.357
You're right.
It would appear we're locked

39:19.398 --> 39:21.776
in a twisted Greek tragedy.

39:21.817 --> 39:24.153
But my guidance counselor
told me...

39:24.195 --> 39:26.322
that there is
one way to end this.

39:28.783 --> 39:31.077
I have to kill you.

39:31.118 --> 39:35.623
Don't worry. I wouldn't stoop
to your level to murder. No.

39:35.664 --> 39:39.168
I'm going to kill you
on the battlefield you cherish
above all others.

39:39.960 --> 39:40.628
Business.

39:40.669 --> 39:45.674
I'm going to take you on
head-to-head, and destroy you.

39:45.716 --> 39:48.219
Just like Oedipus and Electra
did to their daddies.

39:48.260 --> 39:50.012
And when I'm done,

39:50.054 --> 39:53.182
I will bury your battered
and beaten carcass

39:53.224 --> 39:54.683
and be free of you...

39:55.559 --> 39:56.852
once and for all.

40:00.439 --> 40:01.524
[gulps]

40:02.900 --> 40:04.777
This bottle I cracked open

40:04.819 --> 40:08.155
is a lot better
than the swill you've been
making recently, Daddy.

40:08.781 --> 40:10.533
But my rum...

40:10.574 --> 40:12.910
will be far superior.

40:37.393 --> 40:39.728
These are really great, Jug.

40:39.770 --> 40:41.897
You really captured the essence
of the Baxter Brothers,

40:41.939 --> 40:43.816
but you made it your own.

40:43.858 --> 40:45.443
And I caught up on
all my college applications.

40:45.484 --> 40:47.319
So wait, I wanna
show you something.

40:48.904 --> 40:50.531
This...

40:50.573 --> 40:54.076
An article I found from 2002.

40:54.118 --> 40:57.246
[Betty] "Novelist
Theodore Weisel drowns
in yachting accident."

40:57.288 --> 40:58.164
Why does that name
sound familiar?

40:58.164 --> 41:01.292
He was in the Quill and Skull
literary society
with my grandfather.

41:01.333 --> 41:02.918
I tracked down
all the original members.

41:02.960 --> 41:03.669
Yeah, of course,
they could tell you something

41:03.711 --> 41:06.881
about what your grandad
and DuPont were like back then.

41:06.922 --> 41:11.051
But guess what?
Theodore's not the only one
who suffers an accident.

41:11.093 --> 41:13.804
This one is from 1978.

41:14.388 --> 41:15.723
Drove off a bridge.

41:15.764 --> 41:19.310
This one's from 1994.
Mechanical failure.

41:19.351 --> 41:21.520
In fact, DuPont
and my MIA grandfather

41:21.562 --> 41:23.564
are the only ones
of the society
who are not dead.

41:23.606 --> 41:27.359
Which begs the question,
are these all horrible,
suspicious accidents--

41:27.401 --> 41:28.360
Or murders?

41:29.612 --> 41:32.907
Jug, if you're right,
you need to transfer.

41:32.948 --> 41:35.367
I can't.
We're so close to this.

41:35.409 --> 41:36.994
-I can feel it.
-Yeah.

41:37.036 --> 41:38.787
That's what I'm afraid of.

41:43.334 --> 41:46.170
Are you sure
these are the three suspects
you saw that night?

41:46.837 --> 41:48.672
It's definitely them.

41:48.714 --> 41:50.799
Those are the kids
we saw kill Jughead.
