01:37.640 --> 01:40.410

(male #1)
Move them out of here.
Make it snappy.

03:43.999 --> 03:45.668
Okay, sheriff.

03:47.570 --> 03:49.572
Hey, who are you?

03:49.639 --> 03:51.807
You'll find out.

03:54.476 --> 03:55.878
Come on, boys.

03:57.412 --> 03:59.982
(Sheriff)
'Might as well
begin right here.'

04:03.052 --> 04:05.420
Get out of here.
Come on, out of here.

04:05.487 --> 04:06.856
Hey, hey, you, hey, hey.

04:06.922 --> 04:08.958
Go take that clothes off.

04:09.024 --> 04:12.828
Come on, you fellas. Get out.
Get the music racks out of here.

04:12.895 --> 04:14.964
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

04:15.030 --> 04:16.365
What is this?

04:16.430 --> 04:17.800
Well, who are you?

04:17.867 --> 04:19.902
I'm Barney Hopkins,
producer of this show.

04:19.969 --> 04:21.837
Oh, yeah? Well,
that's tough luck, brother.

04:21.904 --> 04:23.739
I'm from the sheriff's office.

04:23.806 --> 04:26.576
Legal attachment
to collect for the credit.

04:26.642 --> 04:29.144
Corpus delecti
or seize the body.

04:29.211 --> 04:30.245
What? Again?

04:31.413 --> 04:33.248
Don't you dare!

04:33.315 --> 04:36.151
Don't worry sis. This'll look
nice in the sheriff's office.

04:36.218 --> 04:37.953
(male #2)
Break down
that scenery!

04:38.020 --> 04:39.288
What's the excitement?

04:39.354 --> 04:41.156
It means they closed
the show, dumbbell.

04:41.223 --> 04:43.158
(male #3)
Here, give me that costume!

04:43.225 --> 04:45.995
- I beg your pardon!
- We got to take it back.

04:46.061 --> 04:48.363
Well, that's as far
back as it goes.

04:48.430 --> 04:51.634
- We gotta have that costume.
- At least leave me carfare.

04:51.701 --> 04:53.102
What for?

04:53.168 --> 04:55.638
This is our dress rehearsal.
We got a great show.

04:55.705 --> 05:00.409
It opens tomorrow. Don't do this
because I don't pay few bills.

05:00.475 --> 05:02.444
When the show opens
I will pay them.

05:02.511 --> 05:05.280
Tell it to the sheriff.

05:05.347 --> 05:09.451
This is the fourth in two months
that I've been in and out of.

05:09.518 --> 05:11.887
They close before they open.

05:11.954 --> 05:14.590
The depression, deary.

05:51.026 --> 05:54.830
I can remember when that
alarm clock used to ring.

05:54.897 --> 05:57.266
Those good old days
when you had to get up.

05:57.332 --> 06:00.202
Come on. Let's get up
and look for work.

06:00.269 --> 06:02.004
I hate starving in bed.

06:02.071 --> 06:05.074
Name me a better
place to starve.

06:05.140 --> 06:06.809
Your stomach.

06:06.876 --> 06:10.079
Well, let's get up
and get dressed.

06:10.145 --> 06:12.782
I thought we might
try the flea circus.

06:12.848 --> 06:14.850
Maybe they got something
for us there.

06:14.917 --> 06:17.552
What can we get
at a flea circus?

06:17.619 --> 06:19.188
Fleas.

06:19.254 --> 06:20.723
You can get those here.

06:20.790 --> 06:23.926
Alright, come on.
Let's get up.

06:23.993 --> 06:25.327
One.

06:25.394 --> 06:27.162
'Two.'

06:27.229 --> 06:28.964
Three.

06:34.704 --> 06:38.040
- How about some nourishment?
- What's on the menu, Trixie?

06:38.107 --> 06:40.109
We'll see what
the neighbors have to offer.

06:40.175 --> 06:42.111
Cut the bread and set the table.

06:42.177 --> 06:45.214
- Have we any bread?
- Yeah. Have we any table?

07:03.699 --> 07:05.334
Ha ha ha!

07:05.400 --> 07:08.237
What neighbors,
oh, what neighbors.

07:08.303 --> 07:11.540
I can remember not so long ago,
a penthouse on Park Avenue

07:11.606 --> 07:15.044
with a real tree and flowers
a fountain, and a French maid.

07:15.110 --> 07:17.913
And a warm bath
with salt from Yardley's.

07:17.980 --> 07:20.049
And a little dress
that Schiaparelli ran up.

07:20.115 --> 07:23.318
And a snappy roadster
and a ride through the park.

07:23.385 --> 07:24.987
And now stealing milk.

07:25.054 --> 07:27.422
That's alright. The dairy
company stole it from a cow.

07:27.489 --> 07:31.093
About a year ago at this time,
I was on my way to Havana.

07:31.160 --> 07:33.328
The birds were singing,
and the sky was blue.

07:33.395 --> 07:35.564
I said to the mug
in the next pew

07:35.630 --> 07:38.000
"I need a couple
of hundred dollars, big boy."

07:38.067 --> 07:42.271
and he said,
"In my pants pocket."

07:42.337 --> 07:44.273
I reached over and took $500

07:44.339 --> 07:47.009
out of his back pants pocket
just like that.

07:47.076 --> 07:50.780
All I got left are his pajamas
and I'm a milk snatcher.

07:50.846 --> 07:52.214
[knock on door]

07:52.281 --> 07:54.416
Guess we got to give it back.

07:55.550 --> 07:56.718
[knock on door]

07:56.786 --> 07:59.088
Maybe it's the piano remover.

08:04.426 --> 08:05.460
Fay!

08:05.527 --> 08:07.329
Who'd you think
it was? The wolf?

08:07.396 --> 08:11.233
If it was, we'd eat it. Why
the blue spectacles, grandma?

08:11.300 --> 08:13.602
So the landlady
won't recognize me.

08:13.668 --> 08:16.238
I'm obligated to her
for a little item called rent.

08:16.305 --> 08:19.508
Well, if you've come to make
a touch, the bank has folded.

08:19.574 --> 08:21.877
Your millions are safe, Trixie.

08:21.944 --> 08:24.213
I came to tell
you gals good news.

08:24.279 --> 08:26.748
Barney's putting on a new show.

08:26.816 --> 08:28.283
- Barney?
- Barney Hopkins?

08:28.350 --> 08:30.285
Rehearsals start in two weeks.

08:30.352 --> 08:33.355
- He must have found an angel.
- Let's go over and find out.

08:33.422 --> 08:35.590
When the mob finds out,
they'll be after him.

08:35.657 --> 08:39.428
We can't all go. We haven't got
decent clothing left for one.

08:39.494 --> 08:43.265
Yeah, if one doesn't look modish
with Barney, it's thumbs down.

08:43.332 --> 08:47.102
Let's scare up to make one of us
look, as you say, modish.

08:47.169 --> 08:48.971
- Who's to go?
- Let's match for it.

08:49.038 --> 08:50.172
- Taxis!
- Yellow!

08:50.239 --> 08:51.673
- Checker!
- Red-top!

08:51.740 --> 08:53.208
Black and white!

09:04.219 --> 09:06.688
- Checkers.
- Aw, Carol wins.

09:06.755 --> 09:09.758
Aw, gee. I look much better in
clothes than any of you.

09:09.825 --> 09:13.963
- If Barney sees me in clothes--
- He wouldn't recognize you.

09:14.029 --> 09:15.664
What happened
to your lovely-mink coat?

09:15.730 --> 09:18.600
Uncle's got it, got everything.
We even hocked our inlays.

09:18.667 --> 09:21.103
- Honey, give me my stockings.
- Sure, there they are.

09:21.170 --> 09:23.873
Fay, you got to give
Carol that dress.

09:23.939 --> 09:27.642
- I've to go to the drugstore.
- We'll give you something good.

09:27.709 --> 09:29.444
The dress belongs to them.

09:29.511 --> 09:31.413
- I'm a hostess there.
- Stand still.

09:31.480 --> 09:32.948
So am I a hostess.

09:33.015 --> 09:36.218
Got to entertain Barney
with the idea of giving us work.

09:38.087 --> 09:40.856
Don't forget to stand in light
when you're talking to Barney.

09:40.923 --> 09:44.459
They know what they're doing
when they dress their hostesses.

09:44.526 --> 09:46.128
You don't look bad.

09:46.195 --> 09:48.163
Take these papers, get through
the enemy's lines.

09:48.230 --> 09:51.100
- Ride like blazes. Taxi fare.
- Lots of luck, Carol.

09:51.166 --> 09:54.636
Thanks. Well, here we go.
Laughing and wondering.

09:54.703 --> 09:58.240
Watch yourself in the clinches.
Dress belongs to the drugstore.

09:58.307 --> 10:00.375
I'd like to meet that druggist.

10:00.442 --> 10:04.846
The best comedienne on Broadway
will proceed to make beds.

10:04.914 --> 10:07.349
Well, I'm going to get
a glass of milk.

10:07.416 --> 10:09.518
[piano music]

10:22.797 --> 10:28.603
* In the shadows
let me come and sing to you *

10:30.239 --> 10:36.478
* Let me dream a song
that I can bring to you *

10:38.413 --> 10:44.219
* Take me in your arms
and let me cling to you *

10:45.720 --> 10:51.526
* Let me linger long

10:51.593 --> 10:57.366
* Let me lilt my song

10:57.432 --> 11:03.973
* In the winter let me
bring the spring to you *

11:05.740 --> 11:12.514
* Let me feel that I mean
everything to you *

11:14.649 --> 11:19.288
* Love's old song *

11:20.855 --> 11:24.326
* Will be new

11:27.896 --> 11:30.632
* In the shadows when I come

11:30.699 --> 11:36.471
* And sing to you, dear

11:38.207 --> 11:46.815
* In the shadows
when I come and sing *

11:46.881 --> 11:49.418
* To you *

12:01.496 --> 12:03.432
Oh, you can't turn
these sheets anymore.

12:03.498 --> 12:05.267
They've only got two sides.

12:05.334 --> 12:09.238
Polly, quit mooning over that
good-for-nothing songwriter.

12:09.304 --> 12:11.240
Where's that going to get you?

12:11.306 --> 12:13.142
Oh, he's wonderful, Trixie.

12:13.208 --> 12:14.876
Honey, he's a songwriter.

12:14.943 --> 12:18.013
So is Irving Berlin. What's
wrong about being a songwriter?

12:18.080 --> 12:20.115
How long have you
known him? Two weeks?

12:20.182 --> 12:21.816
What do you know about him?

12:21.883 --> 12:25.087
I knew everything I wanted
to know the minute I met him.

12:25.154 --> 12:27.156
[telephone rings]

12:27.222 --> 12:29.358
- Maybe it's Carol.
- O-o-oh.

12:30.459 --> 12:32.161
Hello.

12:32.227 --> 12:34.829
It's true.
It's really true.

12:34.896 --> 12:36.631
He's putting on a show.

12:36.698 --> 12:40.135
Oh, it's true.
Barney's putting on a show.

12:40.202 --> 12:41.970
We're coming right up
to the apartment.

12:42.037 --> 12:44.673
Be there in 10 minutes.
Phone all the girls.

12:44.739 --> 12:48.543
Phone Fay and Ruth and Mary
and Gwen. Phone them all.

12:48.610 --> 12:51.046
Tell them to come
right over to the apartment.

12:51.113 --> 12:53.248
He hasn't cast yet. No.

12:53.315 --> 12:55.417
Hurry. Don't lose him.

12:55.484 --> 12:57.119
- They're coming up.
- Who?

12:57.186 --> 13:00.155
Barney and Carol. Phone Fay,
all the girls. We're all set.

13:00.222 --> 13:02.591
You phone them. I'll dig up
the old sex appeal.

13:02.657 --> 13:05.260
I'll steam shovel
for the way I feel.

13:08.297 --> 13:09.898
Havermyer 48..

13:09.964 --> 13:12.934
Step on it, Polly. They ought
to be here any minute.

13:13.001 --> 13:14.869
(Polly)
'Almost ready.'

13:14.936 --> 13:19.108
Gosh. Do you think we're going
to have jobs again, earn money?

13:19.174 --> 13:21.143
I've been off
the gold standard so long.

13:21.210 --> 13:22.177
[knock on door]

13:22.244 --> 13:24.146
Oh, it's them!

13:25.514 --> 13:27.282
Come on in, Barney.
Meet the girls.

13:27.349 --> 13:29.784
- Hello, Mr. Hopkins.
- Howdy. Howdy.

13:29.851 --> 13:31.253
Hello, Mr. Hopkins.

13:32.887 --> 13:35.690
(Barney)
'I've seen that face before.'

13:35.757 --> 13:39.961
If it isn't Barney, good-old
smiling-big-hearted Barney.

13:40.028 --> 13:43.432
- You're putting on a show?
- Yes. I'm doing a show.

13:43.498 --> 13:46.168
You sound more enthusiastic.
That mean it's good?

13:46.235 --> 13:48.603
Good? It's the finest thing
I ever had.

13:48.670 --> 13:53.642
Come on over here and sit down
and tell us all about it.

13:53.708 --> 13:55.710
I figured it out
from every angle, kids.

13:55.777 --> 13:58.347
I can't see how it'd run
less than six months

13:58.413 --> 14:00.349
or gross less than
half a million.

14:00.415 --> 14:02.617
That's figuring on
30 grand a week.

14:02.684 --> 14:05.220
At the Broadhurst
we could do 40.

14:05.287 --> 14:07.122
We'll do 40 with this show.

14:07.189 --> 14:08.723
(Polly)
'Gosh!'

14:10.024 --> 14:12.026
- I remember you.
- Oh, do you?

14:12.093 --> 14:16.198
You were in the chorus. Someday,
you're coming out of the chorus.

14:16.265 --> 14:18.367
Oh, thank you,
Mr. Hopkins.

14:18.433 --> 14:20.068
Could you use
me too, Mr. Hopkins?

14:20.135 --> 14:23.505
Sure. I'm going to use
all the girls I used before.

14:23.572 --> 14:26.641
Carol here will be featured.

14:26.708 --> 14:29.144
And Trixie is comic.

14:29.211 --> 14:31.780
I got some ideas
for song numbers for you, honey

14:31.846 --> 14:34.883
that will drape them over their
seats. Something new, different.

14:34.949 --> 14:38.153
- What's the show about?
- It's all about the depression.

14:38.220 --> 14:40.021
We won't have to rehearse that.

14:40.088 --> 14:41.690
Now, it's my idea..

14:41.756 --> 14:43.692
[piano music]

14:46.961 --> 14:50.465
- Who is that playing?
- Oh, some palooka songwriter.

14:50.532 --> 14:52.534
I don't know that number.
What is it?

14:52.601 --> 14:54.503
It's his own.
He composes music.

14:54.569 --> 14:56.605
Shut the window.
Let's get on with this.

14:56.671 --> 14:59.241
Wait a minute.
That's not bad.

14:59.308 --> 15:01.876
Ask the fellow to come on over.

15:01.943 --> 15:04.246
- Oh, Brad!
- Hello.

15:04.313 --> 15:06.448
- Come on over, quick.
- Alright.

15:08.016 --> 15:12.554
That number's got a great feel
to it. The boy's got something.

15:12.621 --> 15:14.689
- Yeah, a piano.
- What's he done?

15:14.756 --> 15:17.959
He hasn't had a chance
to do anything yet, Mr. Hopkins.

15:18.026 --> 15:20.695
But he has genius.

15:20.762 --> 15:23.164
Well, the show business
could stand a little genius.

15:23.232 --> 15:24.766
[knock on door]

15:24.833 --> 15:27.101
Barney, what's the idea
wasting time with a genius

15:27.168 --> 15:29.738
when there's hard-working girls
like us to worry about?

15:32.173 --> 15:35.610
- What is it, honey?
- I want you to meet somebody.

15:35.677 --> 15:38.680
This is Brad Roberts.
Mr. Hopkins is our producer.

15:38.747 --> 15:40.682
Never mind that.
Sit down and play.

15:40.749 --> 15:42.684
- Play what?
- That number you were playing.

15:42.751 --> 15:45.887
- But I--
- It's okay. We're friends.

15:45.954 --> 15:49.090
- Go on, Brad.
- Well, alright.

15:49.157 --> 15:51.293
Oh, I beg your pardon.

15:52.627 --> 15:54.329
Say, what's this
all about, anyway?

15:54.396 --> 15:57.165
Go ahead and play.
Sing it if you got words.

15:57.232 --> 15:59.301
Alright.
Here goes.

16:02.437 --> 16:07.542
* I've got to sing
a torch song *

16:07.609 --> 16:10.679
* For that's the way I feel *

16:10.745 --> 16:16.485
* When I feel a thing
then I can sing *

16:17.452 --> 16:21.490
* It must be real

16:22.857 --> 16:28.029
* I couldn't sing a gay song *

16:28.096 --> 16:31.232
* It wouldn't be sincere *

16:31.300 --> 16:36.805
* I could never croon
a happy tune *

16:38.440 --> 16:42.344
* Without a tear

16:42.411 --> 16:46.815
* I have my dreams
but one by one *

16:46.881 --> 16:51.320
* They vanish in the sky *

16:51.386 --> 16:54.356
* I try to smile

16:54.423 --> 16:57.025
* And face the sun

16:57.091 --> 17:00.862
* But romance passes by

17:03.865 --> 17:09.103
* I've got to sing
a torch song *

17:09.170 --> 17:12.574
* To someone far apart *

17:12.641 --> 17:19.280
* For the torch I bear
is burning there *

17:21.450 --> 17:28.457
* Right in my heart *

17:30.258 --> 17:32.894
That's great! I like it.
Have you got anything else?

17:32.961 --> 17:36.565
- Yes. A couple of things.
- Well, play them. Play them.

17:40.802 --> 17:42.504
[knock on door]

17:46.007 --> 17:49.411
Oh, hello, Mr. Hopkins.
It's charming to see you again.

17:50.845 --> 17:53.014
Sit down, sit down.

17:54.949 --> 17:57.652
I don't like that, son.
It's too dull.

17:57.719 --> 18:00.622
Is this a piano lesson?
Are we gonna about this show?

18:00.689 --> 18:03.625
Shh, shh! Say, have you
got something

18:03.692 --> 18:06.260
with kind of a march effect,
march rhythm to it?

18:06.327 --> 18:08.597
Yes. I have something
about a forgotten man

18:08.663 --> 18:10.599
but I don't have the words yet.

18:10.665 --> 18:12.767
Well, play it.
Play it.

18:12.834 --> 18:15.003
I just got the idea
for it last night.

18:15.069 --> 18:18.072
I was down on Times Square
watching those men in bread line

18:18.139 --> 18:20.609
standing in the rain, waiting
for coffee and doughnuts.

18:20.675 --> 18:23.211
'Men out of a job
around a soup kitchen.'

18:23.277 --> 18:24.946
Stop!

18:25.013 --> 18:27.048
Go on. That's it.

18:27.115 --> 18:29.317
That's what this show's
about. The depression.

18:29.384 --> 18:31.420
Men marching,
marching in the rain.

18:31.486 --> 18:34.856
Doughnuts and crullers.
Men marching, marching.

18:34.923 --> 18:37.526
Jobs, jobs,
and in the background

18:37.592 --> 18:39.428
Carol, the spirit
of the depression.

18:39.494 --> 18:40.862
A blues song.

18:40.929 --> 18:44.533
No, not a blues song
but a wailing, a wailing.

18:44.599 --> 18:47.402
And this gorgeous woman
singing this song

18:47.469 --> 18:48.903
that will tear their hearts out.

18:48.970 --> 18:52.507
The big parade.
The big parade of tears.

18:52.574 --> 18:55.410
That's it! That's it!
Work on it! Work on it!

18:55.477 --> 18:58.980
- I'd like to do a specialty.
- Sit down. You'll do blackout.

19:01.049 --> 19:03.752
I'll cancel my contract with
Warren and Dubin. They're out.

19:03.818 --> 19:07.021
I want you to write the music
for this show and the lyrics.

19:07.088 --> 19:09.724
- Can you write lyrics?
- You bet he can.

19:11.192 --> 19:14.596
I got it all figured out. I want
your stuff, son. It's great.

19:14.663 --> 19:16.598
I definitely want it.

19:16.665 --> 19:19.367
Mr. Hopkins, you can have it...
on one condition.

19:19.434 --> 19:20.935
Yeah?

19:21.002 --> 19:24.272
If Ms. Parker, Polly has
a principal part in the show.

19:24.338 --> 19:26.908
She's helped me a lot
and she's really great herself.

19:26.975 --> 19:29.377
You're telling me?
I'm telling you.

19:29.444 --> 19:31.179
I'll tell you
something else, too.

19:31.245 --> 19:34.449
You got a swell voice
and a great personality.

19:34.516 --> 19:36.851
You're different.
You got class.

19:36.918 --> 19:39.053
I want you to sing in this show.

19:39.120 --> 19:41.289
Thanks a lot
but that's impossible.

19:41.355 --> 19:45.627
Listen, you and Polly would make
a swell team like the astaires.

19:45.694 --> 19:47.662
You'd be a knockout
for the mush interest.

19:47.729 --> 19:49.397
I'm sorry, but it's impossible.

19:49.464 --> 19:50.832
But Brad, why not?

19:50.899 --> 19:52.867
I can't, honey,
for a lot of reasons.

19:52.934 --> 19:56.771
Let me get in. Isn't there going
to be any comedy in this show?

19:56.838 --> 19:59.841
Plenty. The gay side,
the hard-boiled side

19:59.908 --> 20:02.343
the cynical and funny
side of the depression.

20:02.410 --> 20:05.113
I'll make them laugh at you
starving to death, honey.

20:05.179 --> 20:07.148
It'll be the funniest
thing you ever did.

20:07.215 --> 20:10.752
- You ever see me ride a pony?
- When do rehearsals begin?

20:10.819 --> 20:12.921
- Rehearsals?
- Uh-huh.

20:13.988 --> 20:16.224
- When I get the money.
- Get the money?

20:16.290 --> 20:17.826
(all)
Money?

20:17.892 --> 20:21.696
That's always the way it is.
I got the show, music, cast.

20:21.763 --> 20:24.198
And the theater,
all raring to go.

20:24.265 --> 20:26.935
And it's the old,
old story, money.

20:27.001 --> 20:30.171
- No money at all?
- Not even the old shoestring.

20:30.238 --> 20:33.007
- But you-you let us think--
- What did I let you think?

20:33.074 --> 20:36.144
I told you I had
a great show and I have.

20:36.210 --> 20:37.946
But you said it was all set.

20:38.012 --> 20:40.314
It is set. It's been set
for six months.

20:40.381 --> 20:43.952
Every time I get an angel to put
the bankroll, something happens.

20:44.018 --> 20:47.589
'I had one yesterday. Only
today, he came to me and said'

20:47.656 --> 20:50.024
he and his wife,
who was suing him for divorce

20:50.091 --> 20:52.060
had become reconciled,
and she didn't want him

20:52.126 --> 20:54.262
fooling around
in the show business

20:54.328 --> 20:56.130
and here I am, holding the bag.

20:56.197 --> 20:59.067
You've got your nerve, Barney.
What about these girls?

20:59.133 --> 21:01.736
They've given up jobs
because you said..

21:01.803 --> 21:03.572
Oh, you ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

21:03.638 --> 21:06.908
Gee, it's tough enough without
you making mugs out of us.

21:06.975 --> 21:08.977
We counted on this, all of us.

21:09.043 --> 21:11.813
Wait a minute, kids.
I'm not going to let you down.

21:11.880 --> 21:13.882
I've got other irons
in the fire.

21:13.948 --> 21:16.651
Two men are due here
tomorrow from out of town

21:16.718 --> 21:18.252
Texas. Cattle.

21:18.319 --> 21:19.721
Texas. Cattle.

21:19.788 --> 21:22.156
How can they sell cattle?
Who eats meat anymore?

21:22.223 --> 21:24.425
All I can say is..

21:24.492 --> 21:26.027
How much do you need?

21:26.094 --> 21:27.428
$50,000.

21:27.495 --> 21:31.099
There isn't $50,000 in the world
not to put a show on with.

21:31.165 --> 21:35.203
Alright, then, who needs 50,000?
Make it 40, 25.

21:35.269 --> 21:37.639
If I wanted to chisel
and I know how

21:37.706 --> 21:40.575
I could do it for 15, but..

21:40.642 --> 21:42.744
I'll advance you 15.

21:44.212 --> 21:47.215
What does he use? I'll smoke it
too. Quit joking, will you?

21:47.281 --> 21:50.084
It isn't smart to make gags
when girls are starving.

21:50.151 --> 21:52.553
This is too serious a matter to
all.

21:52.621 --> 21:54.623
Honey, I'll be glad to do it.

21:54.689 --> 21:56.324
Where can you get 15 grand?

21:56.390 --> 22:00.094
'He means real money
not streetcar transfers.'

22:00.161 --> 22:02.363
Remember, one condition
Polly's featured.

22:02.430 --> 22:04.565
Anything you say.

22:07.836 --> 22:11.072
No. I can't give you a check...
for certain reasons.

22:11.139 --> 22:13.307
I'll give you cash tomorrow.
Is that all right?

22:13.374 --> 22:16.911
- Ha! You fell for it, Barney.
- He did. He fell for it.

22:16.978 --> 22:18.913
That's what's commonly
known as a gag.

22:18.980 --> 22:22.583
It's not a gag. I mean it.
I'll be in your office at 10:30.

22:22.651 --> 22:26.254
You have my word for it. I'll go
work on that number a little.

22:26.320 --> 22:28.790
I'll see you later.
Goodbye, honey.

22:39.668 --> 22:41.135
Brad!

22:41.202 --> 22:42.771
Yes?

22:46.607 --> 22:49.010
- Brad, this is cruel.
- What, honey?

22:49.077 --> 22:51.079
To kid about a thing like this.

22:51.145 --> 22:53.114
I'm not kidding.
I'll give him the money.

22:53.181 --> 22:56.050
He'll have it in his office
at 10:30 tomorrow morning.

22:56.117 --> 22:59.253
Where are you going
to get $15,000?

22:59.320 --> 23:01.555
Well, honey,
I'll tell you, I'm..

23:01.622 --> 23:05.994
See this ring? I give it
a twist, make a wish, presto.

23:06.060 --> 23:07.395
Oh, Brad.

23:07.461 --> 23:10.098
Oh, trust me, will you,
honey? And I'm not joking.

23:10.164 --> 23:12.533
Well, that's just the trouble.
I do trust you.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.002
- Oh, honey.
- What?

23:14.068 --> 23:15.670
No. I won't
say it yet.

23:15.737 --> 23:19.741
I have an idea, I want to get
to the piano before I lose it.

23:19.808 --> 23:21.943
See you later, huh?

23:37.591 --> 23:41.462
He meant it. Really he did.
I'd stake my life on it.

23:41.529 --> 23:43.631
Faith, hope, and charity.

23:43.698 --> 23:47.235
You have faith, Barney hopes
and we all need charity.

23:50.171 --> 23:52.106
[piano music]

23:57.846 --> 23:59.948
Wait a minute.

24:00.514 --> 24:01.950
Listen.

24:03.151 --> 24:06.087
He's got it, just what I want.

24:06.154 --> 24:10.124
Don't you hear
that wailing, wailing?

24:10.191 --> 24:13.828
Men marching, marching,
marching in the rain.

24:13.895 --> 24:16.697
Jobs. Jobs.

24:17.631 --> 24:19.934
Gee, don't it get you?

24:47.695 --> 24:49.197
Well?

24:49.263 --> 24:51.532
There's no answer
at Mr. Roberts' apartment.

24:51.599 --> 24:53.367
Trixie can say, "I told you so"

24:53.434 --> 24:55.736
but I won't.
It hurts too much.

24:55.804 --> 24:57.238
[door slams]

24:58.472 --> 25:00.141
Come in, come in.

25:00.208 --> 25:04.012
Gigolo Eddie, always shows up
at the wrong time.

25:04.078 --> 25:07.281
Hello, Barney. I heard you got
some dough to open the show.

25:07.348 --> 25:10.819
Thought you might want to
celebrate. Fresh off the boat.

25:10.885 --> 25:12.320
You heard wrong.

25:12.386 --> 25:15.389
Pull up a coffin and lie down
with the rest of us.

25:15.456 --> 25:19.560
Business is so tough that nobody
even wants to owe me anymore.

25:19.627 --> 25:20.895
You can go.

25:20.962 --> 25:22.897
But you hired me for the day!

25:22.964 --> 25:25.099
I thought I was gonna
need a secretary.

25:25.166 --> 25:29.103
You will pay me for the day
or I'll complain to the agency.

25:29.170 --> 25:32.306
I wish there was somebody
I could complain to.

25:43.451 --> 25:47.155
- Who are you?
- The Kentucky Hill Billies.

25:47.221 --> 25:48.089
Who?

25:48.156 --> 25:50.191
The Kentucky Hill Billies.
Singing.

25:50.258 --> 25:51.192
Dancing.

25:51.259 --> 25:53.061
- Music.
- Wisecracks.

25:53.127 --> 25:56.030
- Know your old Kentucky home?
- You said it.

25:56.097 --> 25:59.233
Scram back there. Your old
mammy's waiting for you.

25:59.300 --> 26:00.835
We get it.

26:00.902 --> 26:03.237
[speaking foreign language]

26:05.706 --> 26:07.275
I better lock this joint

26:07.341 --> 26:10.544
before the acrobats and midgets
start flocking in.

26:13.747 --> 26:15.683
Good morning.
You're early.

26:15.749 --> 26:17.518
I'm sorry I kept
you all waiting.

26:17.585 --> 26:21.189
I got a new idea for a number
and lost track. Got a piano?

26:21.255 --> 26:23.124
Listen, kid, I'm
the comedian around here.

26:23.191 --> 26:25.159
We've had enough
of your gags. Not funny.

26:25.226 --> 26:28.096
Please stop it, Brad.
There's a limit to everything.

26:28.162 --> 26:30.531
I'm locking up. Get out
of here, all of you.

26:30.598 --> 26:32.800
- Don't you want the money?
- Don't kid me!

26:32.867 --> 26:35.103
There you are.
$15,000 cash.

26:35.169 --> 26:37.338
Brad, I knew you were
on the level.

26:37.405 --> 26:38.172
[cheering]

26:38.239 --> 26:40.674
Rehearsals start at 9 a.m.

26:40.741 --> 26:42.543
Fresh off the boat.

26:44.946 --> 26:47.648
* Pettin' in the park *
* Bad boy

26:47.715 --> 26:50.084
* Pettin' in the park *
Bad girl *

26:50.151 --> 26:52.921
* First you pet a little
Let up a little *

26:52.987 --> 26:55.189
* And then you get
a little kiss *

26:55.256 --> 26:56.824
* Pettin' on the sly *

26:56.891 --> 26:58.092
* Oh my

26:58.159 --> 27:00.494
* Act a little shy, oh, why? *

27:00.561 --> 27:03.131
* Struggle just a little
Then hug a little *

27:03.197 --> 27:05.166
* And cuddle up
and whisper this *

27:05.233 --> 27:08.136
* Come on, I've been
waiting long *

27:08.202 --> 27:09.803
(Brad)
Wait a minute! Wait a minute.

27:09.870 --> 27:12.873
Oh, Gordon, you got to put
some life into that song.

27:12.941 --> 27:14.442
Yeah?

27:14.508 --> 27:17.678
Sing it with pep and feeling!
You got it wrong. Listen.

27:17.745 --> 27:21.882
Play the first chorus. Here's
the way it goes. Come on.

27:21.950 --> 27:24.018
* Pettin' in the park, bad boy *

27:24.085 --> 27:26.520
* Pettin' in the park,
bad girl *

27:26.587 --> 27:29.357
* First you pet a little
Let up a little *

27:29.423 --> 27:31.559
* Then you get a little kiss *

27:31.625 --> 27:34.062
* Pettin' on the sly oh, my *

27:34.128 --> 27:36.164
* Act a little shy, oh, why? *

27:36.230 --> 27:38.832
* Struggle just a little
Then hug a little *

27:38.899 --> 27:40.668
* Cuddle up and whisper this *

27:40.734 --> 27:43.304
* Come on, I've been
waiting long *

27:43.371 --> 27:45.139
* Why don't we get started? *

27:45.206 --> 27:47.375
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

27:47.441 --> 27:49.443
What am I doing that's so wrong?

27:49.510 --> 27:51.245
You do this in the middle.

27:51.312 --> 27:53.281
[slowly]
* Come on, I've
been waiting *

27:53.347 --> 27:55.116
That's not the melody.
Here it is.

27:55.183 --> 27:57.318
* Come on, I've been
waiting long *

27:57.385 --> 27:59.420
* Why don't we get started? *

27:59.487 --> 28:01.289
Alright.
Alright.

28:01.355 --> 28:03.291
Now let me tell you something.

28:03.357 --> 28:05.226
I've been a juvenile
for 18 years

28:05.293 --> 28:07.628
and you're going
to tell me how to sing?

28:07.695 --> 28:10.965
Come on, fellows, let me down.
I want a glass of water.

28:11.032 --> 28:13.334
Come on. Show me
that dance chorus.

28:13.401 --> 28:16.904
Snap into it. Hit it, Malcolm.
Come on. Let's go.

28:16.971 --> 28:19.373
Brad, why don't you
do this part?

28:19.440 --> 28:21.409
You've got it over Gordon
like a tent.

28:21.475 --> 28:23.411
Reconsider. Give your
songs a break.

28:23.477 --> 28:27.481
- I told you. I can't do it.
- But you don't tell me why.

28:33.754 --> 28:36.057
You've got a voice,
you've got personality

28:36.124 --> 28:38.092
you can do it,
but you won't. Why?

28:38.159 --> 28:40.928
Will you let it go at that
once and for all?

28:40.995 --> 28:43.031
No public appearances.

28:47.068 --> 28:49.237
- Hi, sweets.
- Hello.

28:53.374 --> 28:56.010
You've got quite a yen
for that boy, haven't you?

28:56.077 --> 28:58.479
Oh, I, uh, I like him,
of course.

28:58.546 --> 29:02.016
There's something funny about
him, something very mysterious.

29:02.083 --> 29:04.252
Did he tell you
where he got 15,000?

29:04.318 --> 29:07.988
And why he lives on $25 a week
but can get that much money?

29:08.056 --> 29:11.559
Look, a Toronto bank clerk
took $20,000 from bank

29:11.625 --> 29:13.127
and disappeared.

29:13.194 --> 29:14.528
I can read.

29:14.595 --> 29:16.764
That's quite a coincidence,
I should say.

29:16.830 --> 29:18.299
What is?

29:18.366 --> 29:20.801
"New York police asked to
check out Broadway nightspots."

29:20.868 --> 29:24.272
And here's the description.
"5'9", dark hair."

29:24.338 --> 29:25.773
That could describe anybody.

29:25.839 --> 29:28.642
It couldn't describe me,
and it describes him.

29:28.709 --> 29:31.079
He's about 5'9"
and has got dark hair.

29:31.145 --> 29:33.081
And where did he get that cash?

29:33.147 --> 29:34.748
Don't be ridiculous, Trixie.

29:34.815 --> 29:36.884
You're letting your imagination
run away with you.

29:36.950 --> 29:40.554
I don't wanna see you with a guy
who will get you into trouble.

29:40.621 --> 29:42.890
Oh, I know,
but-but I'm sure.

29:42.956 --> 29:44.658
What do you know about him?

29:44.725 --> 29:47.095
Does he ever talk
about himself or his family?

29:47.161 --> 29:49.997
Do you remember he wouldn't
give Barney a check?

29:50.064 --> 29:51.965
And he won't play Gordon's part.

29:52.032 --> 29:55.469
Why? Because he's afraid
that newspaper..

30:02.110 --> 30:05.246
Don't talk and don't
come back here. Do you promise?

30:05.313 --> 30:07.448
I said I wouldn't, didn't I?

30:07.515 --> 30:09.317
So long.

30:10.751 --> 30:13.254
Don't say anything to anyone,
will you, Trixie?

30:39.012 --> 30:40.448
(male #4)
'Whoa!'

30:41.782 --> 30:44.418
'Hurry, will you?
Cut her down.'

30:44.485 --> 30:46.987
(male #5)
'On stage!'

30:47.054 --> 30:48.822
'Stage ready.
Come on.'

30:48.889 --> 30:50.824
On stage!

30:59.200 --> 31:03.604
This stuff is just as good
to rub with as it is to drink.

31:03.671 --> 31:04.938
It penetrates.

31:05.005 --> 31:06.974
Now show me the spot.

31:07.040 --> 31:10.678
It's been an hour,
and he says, "Show me the spot."

31:10.744 --> 31:12.180
Ow!

31:12.246 --> 31:14.515
- What's this?
- It's his lumbago.

31:14.582 --> 31:17.185
- Get up.
- I can't, I tell you.

31:17.251 --> 31:19.153
Oh, you can't get up, can't you?

31:19.220 --> 31:22.156
Oh! Don't, please!
Oh, don't!

31:22.223 --> 31:24.158
Straighten up,
you permanent juvenile.

31:24.225 --> 31:26.093
Oh! I can't,
I tell you. I can't.

31:26.160 --> 31:29.163
You don't suppose you're going
out and singing a love song

31:29.230 --> 31:31.165
with your back
doubled up, do you?

31:31.232 --> 31:33.867
What kind of song
do you think this is?

31:33.934 --> 31:35.169
You've got to straighten up!

31:35.236 --> 31:37.070
You've got to stop being a baby.

31:37.137 --> 31:39.773
Mind over matter.
Mind over matter.

31:39.840 --> 31:41.775
Oh. Oh!

31:41.842 --> 31:43.277
I can't, I tell you.

31:43.344 --> 31:46.414
I got a show. I spent weeks
and months getting a show.

31:46.480 --> 31:48.616
I've worked!
I've slaved!

31:48.682 --> 31:50.150
Opening night!

31:50.218 --> 31:53.053
We open tonight
and he's got lumbago.

31:53.120 --> 31:55.289
Go out and announce
the show is postponed.

31:55.356 --> 31:56.790
Give them their money back.

31:56.857 --> 32:00.194
Tell them our juvenile man's
dying of old age.

32:01.795 --> 32:05.599
Listen, kid, now it's up to you.
You've got to go in his place.

32:05.666 --> 32:07.000
I can't.

32:07.067 --> 32:10.804
Why? The curtain's going up.
The show's going on.

32:10.871 --> 32:12.840
Your girl's in it.
Your music's in it.

32:12.906 --> 32:15.343
Your money's in it!
You've got to do it.

32:15.409 --> 32:17.778
- There's a reason.
- There can't be!

32:17.845 --> 32:19.780
- Alright.
- What's your reason?

32:19.847 --> 32:22.015
Listen, I don't care
if you go to jail.

32:22.082 --> 32:24.652
You ought to forget about
yourself and do this anyway.

32:24.718 --> 32:27.488
You know what it means
if this show doesn't go on.

32:27.555 --> 32:30.758
What it means to the girls,
those poor kids who gave up jobs

32:30.824 --> 32:32.860
and won't be able
to find other ones?

32:32.926 --> 32:36.330
They've been living on nothing,
starving themselves for weeks

32:36.397 --> 32:38.966
hoping for this show
to go on and be a success.

32:39.032 --> 32:41.669
They're counting on you.
You can't let them down.

32:41.735 --> 32:44.104
If you do...God knows
what will happen to them.

32:44.171 --> 32:47.174
They'll have to do things I
wouldn't want on my conscience

32:47.241 --> 32:48.642
and it'll be on yours.

32:48.709 --> 32:51.479
Now you can go out
and sing Gordon's part.

32:51.545 --> 32:54.915
If you don't, I don't care
what your reason is!

32:54.982 --> 32:57.385
She's right, Brad.

32:57.451 --> 32:59.620
I hadn't thought
about it in that way.

32:59.687 --> 33:03.090
- Yes, of course. I'll do it.
- Great, kid! I knew you would.

33:03.156 --> 33:06.460
Get him a dressing room.
He's not on for seven minutes.

33:06.527 --> 33:09.229
We won't have to hold
the curtain. Come on!

33:12.900 --> 33:15.403
Get him ready!

33:15.469 --> 33:17.605
If anything happens
to him now, we're responsible.

33:17.671 --> 33:20.240
There's more to him than
I thought. He has nerve.

33:20.308 --> 33:22.242
He belongs in the show business.

33:22.310 --> 33:24.278
He's risking going
to prison for us.

33:24.345 --> 33:28.248
If he goes to prison for this,
I'll visit him. I swear I will.

33:28.316 --> 33:31.285
I want to tell him that
I know what it means.

33:32.720 --> 33:34.187
- Brad?
- 'Hello.'

33:34.254 --> 33:37.458
Put your ear to the door.
I want to whisper to you.

33:37.525 --> 33:39.159
(Brad)
'Alright.'

33:39.226 --> 33:41.995
Brad, it's wonderful of you
to take this chance tonight.

33:42.062 --> 33:43.731
It's-it's courageous.

33:43.797 --> 33:45.733
(Brad)
'Oh, it's not
courageous, exactly.'

33:45.799 --> 33:48.268
'But how do you know?
Do you know?'

33:48.336 --> 33:50.571
Oh, but don't think
about it, Brad.

33:50.638 --> 33:53.741
Just think about...
I love you

33:53.807 --> 33:56.510
and I always will
no matter what happens.

33:56.577 --> 33:58.512
(Brad)
'Gee, that's swell, honey.'

33:58.579 --> 34:00.748
After tonight, you can tell me
all about it.

34:00.814 --> 34:03.250
I'll understand
and maybe I can help.

34:03.317 --> 34:05.018
(Brad)
'After tonight?'

34:05.085 --> 34:07.955
(male #5)
'Hurry, Ms. Parker.
Hurry, Mr. Roberts.'

34:08.021 --> 34:09.056
Wish us luck, sweetheart.

34:09.121 --> 34:11.458
Oh, I do.
I wish us luck.

34:13.092 --> 34:15.329
[applause]

34:15.396 --> 34:17.864
["Pettin' In The Park"]

34:25.773 --> 34:28.509
* Every night
a body should relax *

34:28.576 --> 34:31.512
* After all the wear and tear

34:31.579 --> 34:34.348

42:02.662 --> 42:03.997
Who is the boy?

42:04.064 --> 42:06.266
Brad Roberts, according
to the announcements.

42:06.333 --> 42:08.836
The program says
he did most of the music.

42:08.902 --> 42:10.070
Smart kid.

42:10.137 --> 42:11.704
Something's familiar about him.

42:11.771 --> 42:15.375
I've seen him not in the
theater. Let me have a nickel.

42:15.442 --> 42:17.777
Yeah. Here.

42:17.845 --> 42:19.847
I'm going to find out..

42:29.890 --> 42:31.524
Listen.

42:34.061 --> 42:35.863
Why, I can't believe it!

42:35.929 --> 42:38.165
I knew I'd seen him
someplace before.

42:38.231 --> 42:40.400
Let's go get Barney
to tell us the truth.

42:40.467 --> 42:43.403
What a front-page story
that will make. Come on.

42:44.804 --> 42:46.373
[doorbell buzzes]

42:54.114 --> 42:57.184
Polly! Look at this!
Look at it.

42:58.785 --> 43:02.589
(Polly)
'Oh, gosh! Oh,
I can't believe it.'

43:05.125 --> 43:07.727
'I never dreamed
of such a thing!'

43:07.794 --> 43:10.797
(Trixie)
'I knew he was somebody.
You can't fool me.'

43:10.864 --> 43:14.067
Trixie Lorraine, you thought
I was a fool to be involved.

43:14.134 --> 43:16.269
You don't know when I'm kidding.

43:19.873 --> 43:21.208
Mr. Bradford?

43:21.274 --> 43:23.410
- He's on the lounge, sir.
- Thank you.

43:25.778 --> 43:27.948
- Good morning.
- Good morning. You're late.

43:28.015 --> 43:30.117
- Not much, am I?
- 17 minutes.

43:30.183 --> 43:32.119
- Hello, Peabody.
- How are you, young man?

43:32.185 --> 43:33.653
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

43:33.720 --> 43:35.655
I'll come directly
to the point, Robert.

43:35.722 --> 43:38.258
Your family's greatly disturbed
over what has occurred.

43:38.325 --> 43:40.894
I hope you appreciate that
I flew here this morning

43:40.961 --> 43:42.362
in uncertain weather.

43:42.429 --> 43:44.797
As trustee of your estate
and your elder brother

43:44.864 --> 43:46.566
I represent the family

43:46.633 --> 43:48.635
in saying that
we cannot have you mixed-up

43:48.701 --> 43:51.171
in this theater business.
You know how he feel.

43:51.238 --> 43:54.007
Your mother is greatly concerned
and every member of your family.

43:54.074 --> 43:56.643
I cannot begin to describe
to you, my dear boy

43:56.709 --> 43:58.345
the extent of the shock.

43:58.411 --> 44:00.347
I'm sorry everybody
in the family's shocked

44:00.413 --> 44:02.582
but I'd better come
directly to the point too.

44:02.649 --> 44:05.585
- Music is my career.
- Music, yes, but--

44:05.652 --> 44:08.655
The kind that's sung in shows.
Over the radio and on records.

44:08.721 --> 44:11.491
I don't mean the music played by
the Boston symphony orchestra.

44:11.558 --> 44:13.526
You have to be half-dead
to compose that.

44:13.593 --> 44:16.363
I wanna write this other kind.
This show was my opportunity.

44:16.429 --> 44:19.532
The show clicked
and I'm going on with it.

44:19.599 --> 44:22.369
As to appearing with the show
I know how you feel.

44:22.435 --> 44:25.838
I did my best to stay out of it
but an emergency came up

44:25.905 --> 44:29.642
I had to do it. I can't let them
down. Besides, I like it.

44:29.709 --> 44:32.679
Though the family regrets
that one who bears our name

44:32.745 --> 44:35.748
should go in for this sort of...
sensational career.

44:35.815 --> 44:37.684
In preference to banking

44:37.750 --> 44:39.652
nevertheless, we've agreed
not to oppose you.

44:39.719 --> 44:42.822
One thing, however, we must
and will insist upon.

44:42.889 --> 44:44.657
And what's that?

44:44.724 --> 44:46.126
This girl.

44:46.193 --> 44:48.561
This show girl whose name
is linked with yours.

44:48.628 --> 44:50.263
Polly Parker.

44:50.330 --> 44:52.599
- Well, what of it?
- What of it? Simply this--

44:52.665 --> 44:54.834
Listen, before you say anything,
you better know this.

44:54.901 --> 44:58.305
I'm in love with Polly Parker
and I'm going to marry her!

44:58.371 --> 44:59.539
What?

44:59.606 --> 45:01.774
I'm going to complain
to the house committee.

45:01.841 --> 45:03.576
Just what I said.

45:03.643 --> 45:05.578
You marry this
cheap-little-show girl?

45:05.645 --> 45:09.116
Wait a minute. That's pretty
much of an old-fashioned idea.

45:09.182 --> 45:11.985
Families don't interfere
with love affairs nowadays.

45:12.052 --> 45:13.786
If they do, it doesn't
mean anything.

45:13.853 --> 45:17.157
If you marry that girl you'll
get not one cent of income.

45:17.224 --> 45:19.592
I don't have to remind you
until you are 30

45:19.659 --> 45:21.828
I have the right
to cut off your income.

45:21.894 --> 45:25.865
If that's all you have to say
to me, you're wasting your time.

45:25.932 --> 45:28.635
I've got more important
things to do!

45:28.701 --> 45:31.871
I shall certainly complain
to the house committee.

45:31.938 --> 45:33.673
I can't understand it.

45:33.740 --> 45:36.376
It's the girl. I know
these show girls.

45:36.443 --> 45:38.911
They're little parasites,
gold diggers.

45:38.978 --> 45:40.247
I don't doubt it.

45:40.313 --> 45:42.282
I remember in my early youth

45:42.349 --> 45:44.951
I trod the primrose path
on the great white way.

45:45.018 --> 45:46.953
There I learned the bitter truth

45:47.020 --> 45:48.955
that all women of the theater

45:49.022 --> 45:50.957
were chiselers, parasites

45:51.024 --> 45:52.959
or as we call them gold diggers.

45:53.026 --> 45:56.129
I remember well
one experience I had

45:56.196 --> 45:58.831
with a woman of the theater.

45:58.898 --> 46:01.434
It was the day
of the big Harvard game.

46:01.501 --> 46:04.937
We all came down,
a stout company of young blades

46:05.004 --> 46:07.774
eager to learn about life.

46:07.840 --> 46:11.811
I met this girl at the
stage door of the old casino.

46:11.878 --> 46:14.147
'We went to rector's
for a bite.'

46:14.214 --> 46:16.183
I had a cold bird and a bottle.

46:16.249 --> 46:18.185
She nibbled at a steak.

46:18.251 --> 46:23.156
Her name was Eunice.
She called me "fuffy."

46:24.624 --> 46:28.161
I don't know why she did,
but she called me "fuffy."

46:28.228 --> 46:29.662
I'm going to see her.

46:29.729 --> 46:32.299
I don't know where she is.
It's been 30 years.

46:32.365 --> 46:34.134
No, no. I mean
this Polly Parker woman.

46:34.201 --> 46:37.704
I wouldn't if I were you. You're
putting yourself in their hands.

46:37.770 --> 46:40.640
They're all blackmailers,
gold diggers, parasites.

46:42.209 --> 46:44.177
I resign!

46:44.244 --> 46:46.146
- No.
- Yes.

46:47.046 --> 46:49.982
* When I feel a thing

46:50.049 --> 46:52.219
* That I can sing

46:52.285 --> 46:56.389
* It must be real

46:56.456 --> 46:59.058
* I couldn't sing a gay song *

46:59.126 --> 47:02.061
* It wouldn't be sincere *

47:02.129 --> 47:04.597
* I could never croon
a happy tune *

47:04.664 --> 47:05.798
[doorbell buzzes]

47:05.865 --> 47:07.400
Come in!

47:07.467 --> 47:09.236
(Trixie)
'Hey, shut
the bathroom door!'

47:09.302 --> 47:11.438
(Carol)
'I will, Trixie.'

'Come in! Come in!'

* I try to smile
and face the sun *

47:24.717 --> 47:29.522
* But romance passes by *

47:32.091 --> 47:33.726
Well, who is it?

47:33.793 --> 47:36.463
I am J. Lawrence Bradford.

47:38.365 --> 47:40.333
Yes?

47:40.400 --> 47:42.635
I've come to see
Ms. Polly Parker.

47:42.702 --> 47:44.204
Oh, yes.

47:44.271 --> 47:46.339
I'm the brother
of Robert Treat Bradford

47:46.406 --> 47:48.575
'whom you probably know
as Brad Roberts.'

47:48.641 --> 47:50.577
Oh, you are Brad's brother.

47:50.643 --> 47:52.779
Sit down. I'll be
dressed in a minute.

47:52.845 --> 47:54.781
(Lawrence)
'Don't bother, Ms. Parker.'

47:54.847 --> 47:58.651
- But you see, I'm not--
- Please, Ms. Parker.

47:58.718 --> 48:00.653
'I have just spoken
to my brother.'

48:00.720 --> 48:02.755
'He tells me he wants
to marry you.'

48:02.822 --> 48:05.091
You're making a mistake.
Let me explain--

48:05.158 --> 48:06.893
Don't bother to explain.

48:06.959 --> 48:10.497
If he disgraces the family
by marrying a show girl

48:10.563 --> 48:12.499
the family is through with him.

48:12.565 --> 48:15.668
Did you say disgrace the family
by marrying a show girl?

48:15.735 --> 48:17.237
I said exactly that.

48:17.304 --> 48:19.772
Show girls are reputed to be

48:19.839 --> 48:22.275
parasites, chiselers,
gold diggers.

48:22.342 --> 48:25.645
Oh! Show girls
are excellent in their way

48:25.712 --> 48:28.781
attractive creatures,
even fascinating

48:28.848 --> 48:31.651
but hardly fitted to shine
in the upper social circles.

48:31.718 --> 48:34.487
(Lawrence)
'This is not directed against
you personally, Ms. Parker.'

48:34.554 --> 48:36.623
No, I understand that.
Not personally.

48:36.689 --> 48:39.992
All show girls are parasites,
chiselers and gold diggers.

48:40.059 --> 48:41.394
(Lawrence)
'Exactly.'

48:41.461 --> 48:43.396
You'd better let me
tell you that--

48:43.463 --> 48:46.933
- Just tell me how much.
- How much what?

48:46.999 --> 48:48.435
What is your price?

48:48.501 --> 48:51.704
How much do you want to release
Robert from marrying you?

48:51.771 --> 48:53.740
Well, this is very funny.

48:53.806 --> 48:56.643
I see nothing amusing
in it, Ms. parker.

48:56.709 --> 48:58.878
Please, don't let's
waste time. How much?

48:58.945 --> 49:00.980
- I'm sorry.
- 'Sorry?'

49:01.047 --> 49:02.515
No price on me.

49:02.582 --> 49:04.784
I insist, Ms. Parker.
You must have a price.

49:04.851 --> 49:08.455
I am inclined to be generous
in the matter.

49:08.521 --> 49:11.324
After all, I realize that
Bob is a headstrong boy.

49:11.391 --> 49:15.995
I'm in charge of him and I feel
I know what is best for him.

49:16.062 --> 49:18.197
I've had about enough of this.

49:21.100 --> 49:22.602
If you don't mind.

49:22.669 --> 49:27.840
Oh, I beg your pardon,
but am I interrupting?

49:27.907 --> 49:29.376
No, not at all.

49:29.442 --> 49:32.812
This is Brad's brother,
J. Lawrence Bradford.

49:32.879 --> 49:34.581
I'm charmed.

49:34.647 --> 49:36.849
Beware. Trixie's a show girl.

49:36.916 --> 49:39.452
And who is this
distinguished-looking young man?

49:39.519 --> 49:40.520
(Carol)
'I don't know.'

49:40.587 --> 49:42.889
I am Faneuil H. Peabody.

49:42.955 --> 49:44.824
- Faneuil?
- Faneuil.

49:44.891 --> 49:47.360
When I know you better,
I'll call you Fanny.

49:47.427 --> 49:49.562
Have you got a cigarette?

49:53.633 --> 49:55.635
Mmm. Gold.

49:57.169 --> 49:58.938
Oh! Oh, my error.

49:59.005 --> 50:00.807
Have you a light?

50:04.511 --> 50:06.879
Mmm. Your hand is shaking.

50:06.946 --> 50:07.947
'Ha ha ha!'

50:08.014 --> 50:09.982
What an unexpected pleasure.

50:10.049 --> 50:13.252
Come along, let's sit over on
the other side of the room.

50:13.320 --> 50:14.721
Come on! Come along.

50:14.787 --> 50:16.756
You know, I used
to know some Peabodys

50:16.823 --> 50:19.258
but I think
they came from Texas.

50:19.326 --> 50:22.662
Aw, sit down, now.
Come on, sit down.

50:22.729 --> 50:24.531
There.

50:24.597 --> 50:28.768
Mr. J. Lawrence Bradford
tells me I must give Brad up.

50:28.835 --> 50:32.071
'He also says we're gold diggers
and wants to know my price.'

50:32.138 --> 50:34.006
Well, have you told him, Polly?

50:34.073 --> 50:36.443
I was gonna tell him
where to head in.

50:36.509 --> 50:39.312
Oh, I wouldn't be too hasty.

50:39.379 --> 50:41.314
I'd at least discuss it further.

50:41.381 --> 50:42.982
After all,
we're grown up, sensible.

50:43.049 --> 50:46.252
You're a woman of the world.
I'm a man of the world.

50:46.319 --> 50:48.421
Oh, we ought to
have a conference.

50:48.488 --> 50:50.490
Isn't that what businessmen
always have

50:50.557 --> 50:52.759
when they're away
from home? Conferences?

50:52.825 --> 50:54.961
I know a new speakie!
It just opened.

50:55.027 --> 50:57.597
Their liquor is good,
and do I know good liquor.

50:57.664 --> 50:59.432
It's right around the corner.

50:59.499 --> 51:02.535
We'll be ready in two minutes.
I'll just slip into something.

51:02.602 --> 51:05.438
- Oh, I beg your pardon.
- What's that?

51:05.505 --> 51:07.540
My slip. Come along,
Polly, dear.

51:07.607 --> 51:09.976
Let's not keep them waiting.

51:10.042 --> 51:14.747
Oh, here's something
for you to read

51:14.814 --> 51:16.816
Mr. Bradford.

51:16.883 --> 51:22.321
And...here are some pictures
for you to look at.

51:22.389 --> 51:26.959
Now, you amuse yourselves, won't
you? We'll just be two minutes.

51:27.026 --> 51:28.428
Fanny.

51:35.768 --> 51:38.270
Peabody, you're disgusting.

51:38.337 --> 51:42.208
- I'm going to kick them out!
- After he called you parasite?

51:42.274 --> 51:45.277
What's a parasite?
You'd better resent it.

51:45.344 --> 51:47.880
He did get under
my skin. Stuck-up snob.

51:47.947 --> 51:49.849
They've had their turn.
Let's have ours.

51:49.916 --> 51:53.352
We'll take them for a ride. Use
the bathroom I'll use the phone.

51:53.420 --> 51:55.722
Uh, Endicott 2..

51:59.726 --> 52:01.628
Hello, Madam Minnie?

52:01.694 --> 52:03.696
This is Trixie Lorraine.

52:03.763 --> 52:06.265
Say, you know the hat with the..

52:06.332 --> 52:07.634
Yeah.

52:07.700 --> 52:09.368
No, no.

52:09.436 --> 52:12.004
The expensive one.

52:21.648 --> 52:23.850
[door buzzer]

52:26.753 --> 52:28.888
[buzzing continues]

52:33.192 --> 52:35.495
Oh, did the buzzer buzz?

52:38.130 --> 52:40.867
Huh! Oh, what's that?

52:40.933 --> 52:44.537
A COD for Ms. Polly Parker.
Seventy five bucks.

52:44.604 --> 52:47.874
Seventy five bucks just
for a little hat?

52:50.209 --> 52:54.847
Oh-h-h, but she'll look
adorable in that, won't she?

52:54.914 --> 52:56.816
Yes, she will.

52:56.883 --> 52:59.619
Now let me see.
What does COD mean?

53:00.853 --> 53:03.523
That means you've got
to pay for it.

53:03.590 --> 53:06.526
Oh, how inconvenient.

53:06.593 --> 53:08.695
Well, you'll
have to take it back.

53:08.761 --> 53:11.464
Oh, dear. She'll be
in such a bad mood.

53:11.531 --> 53:13.099
- Who will?
- Polly.

53:13.165 --> 53:16.903
She wanted to wear that hat when
she went for lunch with you.

53:16.969 --> 53:19.438
'Oh, dear. When she doesn't
get what she wants.'

53:19.506 --> 53:20.973
You just don't know Polly.

53:21.040 --> 53:23.342
Oh, so disagreeable.
She's no fun at all.

53:23.409 --> 53:24.677
Just sits there.

53:24.744 --> 53:26.913
She won't agree
to anything you say.

53:26.979 --> 53:29.482
She probably won't even
want to go with us.

53:29.549 --> 53:32.619
We three will just
have to go alone.

53:33.820 --> 53:37.289
There you are, boy.
Take it back.

53:37.356 --> 53:39.559
Here, wait a minute.

53:39.626 --> 53:43.129
- How much is it?
- Seventy five bucks.

53:43.195 --> 53:45.865
Seventy five...for a hat?

53:45.932 --> 53:48.535
Sure, that's what
the ticket calls for.

53:53.172 --> 53:55.107
Here.

53:55.174 --> 53:57.577
- Leave the hat.
- You darling man.

53:57.644 --> 54:00.613
Polly's just going
to love you for this.

54:03.950 --> 54:06.753
Polly, this sweet-big
brother of Brad's

54:06.819 --> 54:09.021
has insisted upon paying
for your hat.

54:09.088 --> 54:11.591
- But he mustn't do that.
- But he has.

54:11.658 --> 54:14.694
- But I couldn't.
- But you must.

54:16.128 --> 54:19.098
That looks adorable
on her, doesn't it?

54:19.165 --> 54:21.067
Doesn't it?

54:21.133 --> 54:23.770
Yes, now all you need
is a corsage.

54:23.836 --> 54:25.972
'I think lilies of the valley
and gardenias.'

54:26.038 --> 54:27.974
I guess I'll need orchids.

54:28.040 --> 54:29.809
- Shall we send out for some?
- Yes.

54:29.876 --> 54:33.613
Let's be going. I must get
a 4:00 train to Boston.

54:33.680 --> 54:38.017
I'm very sorry, Mr. Bradford.
I can't leave without a corsage.

54:38.084 --> 54:41.120
I wouldn't let Polly. I couldn't
let her go out that way.

54:41.187 --> 54:43.923
We'll buy you
a corsage on the way.

54:43.990 --> 54:46.926
- But let's hurry.
- Isn't he a darling?

54:46.993 --> 54:49.528
You're just so generous.

54:49.596 --> 54:51.964
[door buzzer]

54:52.031 --> 54:54.400
Polly, I wonder if
you would answer that.

54:54.466 --> 54:56.603
I'm going to powder my nose.

54:59.271 --> 55:02.241
- Well, what's this?
- Well..

55:02.308 --> 55:05.311
Looks like another hat.
We have a hat, my lad.

55:05.377 --> 55:07.580
- But I was--
- Must have the wrong address.

55:07.647 --> 55:09.248
Oh, no.

55:09.315 --> 55:12.518
- Who's the hat for?
- A Miss Trixie Lorraine.

55:12.585 --> 55:15.955
It's for Trixie.
Let me see it.

55:17.724 --> 55:20.660
Look, isn't this ducky? Look.

55:23.996 --> 55:26.332
- How much?
- It's somewhere..

55:26.398 --> 55:28.100
Let me see the bill.

55:28.167 --> 55:30.136
Bill. Yes, sir.

55:32.438 --> 55:35.675
Seventy five dollars.
Do all hats cost $75?

55:35.742 --> 55:39.511
Now, you dear, sweet man. You
aren't going to pay for that.

55:39.578 --> 55:41.981
Trixie. Come on in, Trixie.

55:42.048 --> 55:45.618
I'm very much afraid
I haven't the change.

55:45.685 --> 55:47.620
- How much do you need?
- Five dollars.

55:47.687 --> 55:50.056
You just keep that.
Buy yourself a yacht.

55:50.122 --> 55:53.192
Oh, but I get so seasick.

55:53.259 --> 55:56.996
- Well, thanks.
- Trixie, Trixie.

55:57.797 --> 55:59.365
Did you call me, Polly?

55:59.431 --> 56:02.201
Isn't this darling?
Handsome bought it for you.

56:02.268 --> 56:06.272
Aw, you sweet lamb.

56:06.338 --> 56:08.808
He shouldn't have paid for it.

56:08.875 --> 56:12.611
Oh, dear. Now he'll
think I'm extravagant.

56:12.679 --> 56:16.716
Oh-h-h, but what a pretty hat.

56:16.783 --> 56:18.818
You do like me in it, don't you?

56:18.885 --> 56:21.654
I think we ought to take
a stroll on Fifth Avenue

56:21.721 --> 56:23.690
and look at the shops.

56:23.756 --> 56:25.892
You'd know how reasonable things
are these days

56:25.958 --> 56:27.960
Come on, J. Lawrence.

56:37.069 --> 56:40.840
- Oh-h-h, ha ha ha.
- Ha ha ha.

56:40.907 --> 56:42.675
I'm a busy man, Ms. Parker.

56:42.742 --> 56:44.176
I cannot afford to waste time

56:44.243 --> 56:46.112
in coming to an understanding
with you.

56:46.178 --> 56:49.448
I've been wanting
to ask you a question.

56:49.515 --> 56:51.450
Are your eyes hazel?

56:51.517 --> 56:54.053
- My eyes?
- Uh-hm.

56:54.120 --> 56:56.723
- Please, Ms. Parker.
- They are hazel.

56:56.789 --> 57:02.061
And such nice eyes.
Such a good, kind expression.

57:02.128 --> 57:05.264
- Ms. Parker, please.
- Now don't be so formal.

57:05.331 --> 57:07.767
Didn't you promise
to call me Polly?

57:08.868 --> 57:10.837
- Polly.
- Thanks.

57:11.437 --> 57:12.839
Ha ha ha.

57:16.608 --> 57:18.677
[jazz music]

57:20.179 --> 57:25.117
- I beg your pardon.
- That's alright, Fannykins.

57:25.184 --> 57:27.854
I've got to have
another cigarette.

57:27.920 --> 57:30.890
Platinum. M-m-m.

57:36.395 --> 57:38.064
Oh. Hello, everybody.

57:38.130 --> 57:41.133
Get her. Just when I was
beginning to have a good time.

57:41.200 --> 57:44.336
- Introduce me, won't you?
- I thought you'd left.

57:44.403 --> 57:46.839
- Ms. Fortune, Mr. Bradford.
- How do you do?

57:46.906 --> 57:48.908
- Charmed.
- You didn't introduce me.

57:48.975 --> 57:51.110
Ms. Fortune,
this is Mr. Peabody.

57:51.177 --> 57:54.747
- Oh, Mr. Peabody.
- Ms. Fortune.

57:54.814 --> 57:56.282
My good fortune.

57:56.348 --> 57:59.585
My good man, are you
by any chance punning?

57:59.651 --> 58:01.253
I'm quite a punster.

58:01.320 --> 58:05.491
I suppose you were a stroke
on your college punsing team.

58:05.557 --> 58:09.796
That's funny. That's very funny.
Ms. Fortune, won't you join us?

58:09.862 --> 58:11.831
I'd love to.
I'm just in the mood.

58:11.898 --> 58:15.067
- Some champagne?
- Indeed, doctor recommends it.

58:16.735 --> 58:18.938
- Did you have a mother?
- What?

58:19.005 --> 58:23.042
- Whose name was Eunice?
- No, I don't think so.

58:23.109 --> 58:26.612
I did have a mother.
Whose name was Gertrude.

58:26.678 --> 58:30.649
- You look like Eunice.
- You do look like Eunice.

58:30.716 --> 58:32.551
- Ouch!
- What's the matter?

58:32.618 --> 58:35.387
Fay has an attack of chiseling.
It's chronic with her.

58:35.454 --> 58:38.557
Another look at him with bedroom
eyes and I'll break your leg.

58:38.624 --> 58:42.795
Excuse me for whispering. Fay
and I have so much in common.

58:42.862 --> 58:45.397
Can we have some more champagne?

58:45.464 --> 58:46.999
A quart.

59:00.046 --> 59:03.015
(Lawrence)
'Now I tell you, there's only
one thing to do.'

59:03.082 --> 59:05.151
We've got to spend
more time here.

59:05.217 --> 59:07.153
We've got to see more of her.

59:07.219 --> 59:10.056
I don't wish to see
any more of her.

59:10.122 --> 59:12.691
What I've seen convinces me.

59:12.758 --> 59:14.526
We absolutely
must make her think

59:14.593 --> 59:17.529
we're an easy proposition.
Suckers, you might say.

59:17.596 --> 59:19.899
'What are you
shaking your head for?'

59:19.966 --> 59:22.902
I'm thinking of
the consequences.

59:22.969 --> 59:27.206
I can make this girl transfer
her affection from him to me.

59:28.374 --> 59:32.011
- What?
- Don't misunderstand me.

59:32.078 --> 59:36.748
Nothing personal in it.
This girl is smart.

59:36.815 --> 59:40.386
Now what are you shaking
your head for? Are you afraid?

59:41.988 --> 59:45.391
- Afraid of what?
- I confess I'm a little afraid.

59:48.327 --> 59:53.499
That girl is very fascinating.
But we're not boys, are we?

59:53.565 --> 59:57.103
- Well, hardly.
- We're men, aren't we?

59:57.169 --> 01:00:00.072
And we needn't succumb
to that sort of feminine allure.

01:00:00.139 --> 01:00:02.808
- Need we?
- Indeed, we needn't. Need we?

01:00:02.875 --> 01:00:07.746
Just because they want something
we don't have to give in, do we?

01:00:07.813 --> 01:00:10.082
No. Not at all.

01:00:10.149 --> 01:00:14.120
- Let me have a light, please.
- A light? Certainly.

01:00:16.222 --> 01:00:17.924
A light?

01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:20.359
Yes, yes.

01:00:24.964 --> 01:00:27.666
Where's your lighter?

01:00:27.733 --> 01:00:31.337
My lighter? Oh?

01:00:36.408 --> 01:00:39.845
(Polly)
'Where'd you get
the lighter?'

01:00:39.912 --> 01:00:41.447
Fanny gave it to me.

01:00:41.513 --> 01:00:44.583
Fanny? This is marvelous.
This is wonderful.

01:00:44.650 --> 01:00:46.919
- Who's Fanny?
- Fanny is Faneuil H. Peabody.

01:00:46.986 --> 01:00:49.021
The kind of man
I've been looking for.

01:00:49.088 --> 01:00:51.023
Lots of money and no resistance.

01:00:51.090 --> 01:00:53.859
Old Peabody's the family lawyer.
This is great.

01:00:53.926 --> 01:00:55.594
Well, I don't think
it's so funny.

01:00:55.661 --> 01:00:57.796
We must tell Brad's brother
the truth.

01:00:57.863 --> 01:00:59.131
The truth about what?

01:00:59.198 --> 01:01:01.033
The truth about Carol
not being me.

01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:03.269
Oh, no, you've
got to go on with it.

01:01:03.335 --> 01:01:06.105
He thinks he's pretty darn
smart. Take him for a ride.

01:01:06.172 --> 01:01:08.774
You said it.
Let's go on playing this game.

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:10.142
Gee, it's for prizes.

01:01:10.209 --> 01:01:13.012
Look what I got already.
Gold, platinum, animals.

01:01:13.079 --> 01:01:18.050
That's nothing compared to
what I'm getting out of Fanny.

01:01:18.117 --> 01:01:21.920
I don't think it's right. It's
going to cause more trouble.

01:01:21.988 --> 01:01:24.356
Hey, listen. I could do
something that'd make him

01:01:24.423 --> 01:01:27.426
come to Polly on his knees
and beg her to marry Brad.

01:01:27.493 --> 01:01:29.095
- I've got an idea.
- That's right.

01:01:29.161 --> 01:01:30.862
"Use well before shaking."

01:01:30.929 --> 01:01:32.999
We're going to have
unnecessary trouble.

01:01:33.065 --> 01:01:35.534
But I'd marry Polly
with or without his consent.

01:01:35.601 --> 01:01:39.605
- I want to get even with him.
- I want a chauffeur with a car.

01:01:39.671 --> 01:01:43.042
I want a chauffeur
with buttons and a uniform.

01:01:43.109 --> 01:01:45.611
And I want a dog.

01:01:45.677 --> 01:01:49.081
I want a dog named Fanny.

01:01:51.050 --> 01:01:53.685
(Trixie)
'Buy the little doggie
for Trixie.'

01:01:53.752 --> 01:01:55.321
What do you want the beast for?

01:01:55.387 --> 01:01:57.423
Then I'll have something
to remember you by.

01:01:57.489 --> 01:02:00.292
What name do you wish engraved
on the collar, madam?

01:02:00.359 --> 01:02:01.493
Fanny.

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:04.463
It's not that kind of a dog.

01:02:04.530 --> 01:02:07.199
His name is Fanny.
It's a pet name.

01:02:09.168 --> 01:02:12.471
Every time I look at my dog,
I'll think of you.

01:02:12.538 --> 01:02:14.340
Then I'll have
two little Fannys.

01:02:14.406 --> 01:02:16.575
Here, hold him while
I powder my nose.

01:02:55.381 --> 01:02:58.884
- Shall we dance?
- Certainly. Why not?

01:02:58.950 --> 01:03:00.686
I thought this was my dance.

01:03:00.752 --> 01:03:04.223
Sorry, Bob. Why don't you dance
with this nice young lady?

01:03:04.290 --> 01:03:06.425
Thanks. I'll dance
with whom I please.

01:03:09.961 --> 01:03:12.798
- Shall we indulge?
- Why sure, what can I lose?

01:03:16.168 --> 01:03:18.637
My brother's jealous.

01:03:18.704 --> 01:03:21.006
He has no reason to be.

01:03:21.073 --> 01:03:23.309
I am not prepared to say that.

01:03:23.375 --> 01:03:25.344
Well, then, I'll say it for you.

01:03:25.411 --> 01:03:28.680
You're as light
as a heifer, a feather.

01:03:30.749 --> 01:03:32.684
You know.

01:03:34.653 --> 01:03:38.190
I'm much more the sort
of man for you, Polly.

01:03:39.125 --> 01:03:41.327
Yes, you have your good points.

01:03:42.961 --> 01:03:44.430
Let's dance, honey.

01:03:44.496 --> 01:03:47.266
Don't look at me that way.
He may see you.

01:03:50.669 --> 01:03:53.905
Am I registering jealousy
or am I not?

01:03:53.972 --> 01:03:56.108
No, you're wonderful.

01:03:58.310 --> 01:04:00.612
Watch it. Look jealous.
Here they come.

01:04:06.285 --> 01:04:08.354
Come on, honey.
Let's dance.

01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:11.390
I bet you think it's bolder
dancing this way.

01:04:11.457 --> 01:04:13.592
I think it's delightful.

01:04:19.665 --> 01:04:22.801
- I'm a clumsy soul.
- You're a dear.

01:04:22.868 --> 01:04:24.970
- I'm getting old.
- Aren't we all?

01:04:25.036 --> 01:04:27.038
Say, I'm a little bit
old myself.

01:04:27.105 --> 01:04:31.177
You, old? Why you're the very
personification of youth.

01:04:31.243 --> 01:04:35.147
Oh, thanks, but honest, I don't
know what's the matter with me.

01:04:35.214 --> 01:04:40.018
I have a yen for a little house
in the country, and the fireside

01:04:40.085 --> 01:04:42.921
and carpet slippers
for the old man.

01:04:42.988 --> 01:04:46.792
- Who's the old man?
- You'd run if I told you.

01:04:46.858 --> 01:04:50.829
Ah, I couldn't run
very far. I'm very fat.

01:04:50.896 --> 01:04:53.365
Say, can you imagine me
getting sentimental?

01:04:53.432 --> 01:04:56.602
The most hard boiled dame
on the Dirty White Way.

01:04:56.668 --> 01:04:59.871
You're not hard boiled.
That's just on the surface.

01:04:59.938 --> 01:05:01.240
Underneath, you're--

01:05:01.307 --> 01:05:03.742
Say, what do you know
about me underneath?

01:05:03.809 --> 01:05:05.143
Aha, I mean--

01:05:05.211 --> 01:05:07.613
Oh, I know what you mean,
you old sugar.

01:05:07.679 --> 01:05:11.317
You watch out. I'm falling
in love with you.

01:05:11.383 --> 01:05:15.621
Hello, boy,
when love comes at my age--

01:05:15.687 --> 01:05:16.855
Guess who?

01:05:16.922 --> 01:05:19.725
- It's little Fay.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:05:19.791 --> 01:05:22.428
It's little phooey.

01:05:22.494 --> 01:05:25.931
Oh, Fay, darling,
I have something to show you.

01:05:25.997 --> 01:05:29.335
- Will you excuse us, please?
- Surely, surely.

01:05:29.401 --> 01:05:31.403
- Can you see that?
- See what?

01:05:31.470 --> 01:05:33.071
Read where it says exit?

01:05:33.138 --> 01:05:34.406
- Exit?
- You said it.

01:05:34.473 --> 01:05:36.041
You start walking
and keep walking.

01:05:36.107 --> 01:05:39.311
If you ever come near him again
I'll break both your legs.

01:05:39.378 --> 01:05:41.112
- I could resent that.
- You scram.

01:05:41.179 --> 01:05:42.248
[screaming]

01:05:42.314 --> 01:05:43.815
Did little Fay cry out?

01:05:43.882 --> 01:05:46.685
No, no, that must've been
the cornet you heard.

01:05:46.752 --> 01:05:48.420
[giggles]

01:05:57.629 --> 01:05:59.798
Pardon me, but I think
this is my dance.

01:05:59.865 --> 01:06:02.934
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Hm-m, quite alright.

01:06:03.001 --> 01:06:05.604
[slow music]

01:06:31.229 --> 01:06:33.198
Beautiful, isn't it?

01:06:33.265 --> 01:06:36.067
Yes, beautiful.

01:06:36.134 --> 01:06:39.938
You know, I've been watching
you and wondering..

01:06:41.473 --> 01:06:44.643
...you're so obviously
a girl of breeding.

01:06:46.211 --> 01:06:49.114
- Who are your people?
- My father?

01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:53.051
'My father was an official
in the government service.'

01:06:53.118 --> 01:06:54.986
Her father was a letter carrier.

01:06:55.053 --> 01:06:58.290
Mother...mother was an invalid.

01:06:58.357 --> 01:07:00.359
Her mother could have
licked John L. Sullivan.

01:07:00.426 --> 01:07:02.561
Then how did it happen?

01:07:04.195 --> 01:07:06.465
What are you doing
in this theater?

01:07:06.532 --> 01:07:10.569
Well, you see, it was like this.

01:07:10.636 --> 01:07:15.507
I was at finishing school
when my parents died.

01:07:15.574 --> 01:07:18.276
- And they left me--
- An orphan.

01:07:18.344 --> 01:07:20.946
Yes, an orphan.

01:07:21.012 --> 01:07:24.883
I had to find something
to do, earn money.

01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:29.120
And all I could find was...
well, you see?

01:07:29.187 --> 01:07:31.690
I do see.

01:07:31.757 --> 01:07:34.726
You're the sort
of child who...the sort

01:07:34.793 --> 01:07:41.299
of girl who...not cheap,
not vulgar.

01:07:41.367 --> 01:07:44.770
Not at all like people
in the theater.

01:07:44.836 --> 01:07:47.639
'You know, you are
the girl my brother'

01:07:47.706 --> 01:07:50.041
'should be interested in.'

01:07:52.478 --> 01:07:54.312
- Well, I don't like that.
- Neither do I.

01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:57.282
So we're all too vulgar
for J. Lawrence Bradford.

01:07:57.349 --> 01:07:58.517
No. Not at all.

01:07:58.584 --> 01:08:00.352
All except
this nice little girl.

01:08:00.419 --> 01:08:03.355
- I'm too cheap and vulgar.
- No. I didn't mean that.

01:08:03.422 --> 01:08:07.058
I'm going home. I'm not going to
stay and be insulted like this.

01:08:11.329 --> 01:08:12.864
(Lawrence)
'Polly.'

01:08:12.931 --> 01:08:14.800
- 'Polly, you are--'
- I'm getting lonesome.

01:08:14.866 --> 01:08:18.737
No, Polly, you misunderstood me.
I think you're..

01:08:18.804 --> 01:08:21.407
(Trixie)
'Here I am, honey.'

01:08:25.511 --> 01:08:27.912
[door opens]

01:08:29.147 --> 01:08:33.719
You know I-I want
to make you understand

01:08:33.785 --> 01:08:37.523
I-I wouldn't offend you
for anything in the world.

01:08:37.589 --> 01:08:39.290
Oh, let's forget it.

01:08:39.357 --> 01:08:41.493
How about another drink?

01:08:52.303 --> 01:08:53.904
Here.

01:08:53.971 --> 01:08:55.707
I'll forgive you.

01:08:55.774 --> 01:08:57.709
Bottoms up.

01:08:59.210 --> 01:09:02.113
[slow music]

01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:06.317
I want to say...about you--

01:09:06.384 --> 01:09:08.620
Like me?

01:09:08.687 --> 01:09:10.622
Like isn't the word.

01:09:10.689 --> 01:09:13.124
[slow music continues]

01:09:21.966 --> 01:09:24.569
It goes deeper than that, Polly.

01:09:32.010 --> 01:09:34.613
I don't understand it myself.

01:09:35.881 --> 01:09:39.149
- I love you, Polly.
- You're drunk.

01:09:39.216 --> 01:09:41.787
- No, I'm not--
- Yes, you are. You're drunk.

01:09:44.622 --> 01:09:46.825
I love you, Polly.

01:09:53.631 --> 01:09:55.567
You don't mean a word
you're saying.

01:09:55.634 --> 01:09:59.538
You're just playing, aren't you?
I am, you know.

01:09:59.605 --> 01:10:01.473
Oh, stop it.

01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:03.642
[slow music continues]

01:10:27.098 --> 01:10:29.034
Oh, you are drunk.

01:10:30.368 --> 01:10:32.871
[door knocking]

01:10:32.938 --> 01:10:35.674
- Who is it?
- 'It's me, Trixie.'

01:10:39.711 --> 01:10:41.146
- Where's your key?
- Here it is.

01:10:41.212 --> 01:10:43.649
I can't manage it,
my fingers are frostbitten.

01:10:43.715 --> 01:10:44.950
Where'd you leave Fanny?

01:10:45.016 --> 01:10:48.219
I left Fanny behind.
He's waiting.

01:10:48.286 --> 01:10:51.156
Well, what's the matter
with him, sleeping sickness?

01:10:51.222 --> 01:10:52.724
He passed out.

01:10:52.791 --> 01:10:56.027
He doesn't have to pass out
all over our lounge.

01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:05.103
- Say.
- Say what?

01:11:05.170 --> 01:11:07.873
Have I an idea?
Ask me, "Have I an idea?"

01:11:07.939 --> 01:11:10.275
- Have you an idea?
- Listen.

01:11:10.341 --> 01:11:12.944
- We'll stick him into your bed.
- Oh, no, you don't.

01:11:13.011 --> 01:11:15.280
Don't get excited.
You'll sleep with me.

01:11:15.346 --> 01:11:18.516
When he wakes up
in the morning, will he be

01:11:18.584 --> 01:11:21.486
where we want him?
Will he do what we want?

01:11:21.553 --> 01:11:22.921
- Will he?
- I don't like it.

01:11:22.988 --> 01:11:25.791
- You want to get even with him?
- Yes, I do.

01:11:25.857 --> 01:11:27.425
Can't you see, when he wakes up

01:11:27.492 --> 01:11:30.228
what will he ask himself?
What would anyone ask himself?

01:11:30.295 --> 01:11:33.364
"What happened? What am I doing
in this girl's bed?"

01:11:33.431 --> 01:11:37.803
And how many answers
are there to that? You tell me.

01:11:37.869 --> 01:11:39.738
Oh, but nothing
will have happened.

01:11:39.805 --> 01:11:41.807
Of course not,
nothing will have happened.

01:11:41.873 --> 01:11:43.709
- You said it.
- But he'll think.

01:11:43.775 --> 01:11:45.176
You know what he'll feel like?

01:11:45.243 --> 01:11:47.813
He'll feel like, what do
they call them? A cad.

01:11:47.879 --> 01:11:49.615
- I'll do it.
- You take his head.

01:11:49.681 --> 01:11:53.284
You take his head, I'll take his
feet. Don't want to look at him.

01:11:53.351 --> 01:11:56.354
You know, I thought you were
getting kind of stuck on him.

01:11:56.421 --> 01:11:59.725
Don't be stupid, Trixie. I was
just putting on a good act.

01:11:59.791 --> 01:12:02.160
A very good act.
You certainly fooled me.

01:12:02.227 --> 01:12:05.764
(Trixie)
Okay, dearie,
here you go to bed.

01:12:07.599 --> 01:12:10.636
There, now, my little man.

01:12:10.702 --> 01:12:13.271
If you think I've fallen for
that apple-cheeked boyfriend

01:12:13.338 --> 01:12:14.940
I've been chiseling.

01:12:15.006 --> 01:12:17.943
Say, you'd be surprised
what plans I have for him.

01:12:18.009 --> 01:12:20.912
And will he be surprised.

01:12:20.979 --> 01:12:24.349
Say, I'm going to take him
like Graham took Waterloo

01:12:24.415 --> 01:12:25.817
or whatever he took.

01:12:25.884 --> 01:12:30.722
* And when he wakes up
in the morning *

01:12:30.789 --> 01:12:34.159
* When he wakes up in the mo.. *

01:12:34.225 --> 01:12:35.460
Hey, what's this?

01:12:35.526 --> 01:12:37.696
- Ah, It can't be. It isn't--
- It is.

01:12:37.763 --> 01:12:38.964
How did he get there?

01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:40.999
He passed out,
so we tucked him in.

01:12:41.066 --> 01:12:42.801
This is wonderful.
This is marvelous.

01:12:42.868 --> 01:12:44.870
Well, I'm afraid
we've gone too far.

01:12:44.936 --> 01:12:46.204
- Gone too far?
- Yes.

01:12:46.271 --> 01:12:48.206
Oh, no, this is only
the beginning.

01:12:48.273 --> 01:12:50.441
I have to run.
I've something to attend.

01:12:50.508 --> 01:12:53.011
I'll be back in an hour.

01:12:53.078 --> 01:12:57.749
So, my dear brother, you'll cut
off my income, will you?

01:12:57.816 --> 01:13:00.051
Won't let me marry Polly,
will you?

01:13:00.118 --> 01:13:02.954
Well, listen, old fellow,
you don't know it yet.

01:13:03.021 --> 01:13:06.624
But you're going to wake up
a kinder and a wiser man.

01:13:07.826 --> 01:13:10.128
[slow music]

01:14:07.853 --> 01:14:09.387
(Trixie)
'Good morning.'

01:14:10.856 --> 01:14:13.224
- Good morning.
- How would you like your eggs?

01:14:13.291 --> 01:14:15.226
'Where do you think
you're going?'

01:14:15.293 --> 01:14:18.063
'Think you can do
what you did and get away?'

01:14:18.129 --> 01:14:20.498
Ruin a young girl's future
just because she loves you?

01:14:20.565 --> 01:14:23.234
I don't know where I am,
or what you're saying.

01:14:23.301 --> 01:14:25.737
That's too bad.
I'll tell you where you are.

01:14:25.804 --> 01:14:28.406
Oh, I know where I am, alright.

01:14:28.473 --> 01:14:33.011
I mean, figuratively speaking,
I'm confused, I..

01:14:33.078 --> 01:14:36.347
- I don't know what happened.
- Well, I do.

01:14:36.414 --> 01:14:39.284
Plenty, brother, plenty.

01:14:41.686 --> 01:14:46.157
Ah, tell me, now what do
you want me to do?

01:14:46.224 --> 01:14:48.093
Sit down.

01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:52.864
- How much is it worth to you?
- Worth? What for?

01:14:52.931 --> 01:14:54.933
Call it payment
for a night's lodging.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.868
Well, you don't mean it.

01:14:56.935 --> 01:14:58.669
- Polly doesn't know that--
- Hey, listen.

01:14:58.736 --> 01:15:00.872
What do you think Polly is?

01:15:02.073 --> 01:15:04.209
Oh, I never would
have believed it.

01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:07.846
But why not?
What else could I expect?

01:15:07.913 --> 01:15:10.115
You said it. What else?

01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:15.353
I know what you need, a pen.

01:15:23.161 --> 01:15:25.096
Five thousand,
is that satisfactory?

01:15:25.163 --> 01:15:27.532
What do you think this is,
the Mills Hotel?

01:15:29.935 --> 01:15:31.970
Ten thousand, then.

01:15:33.839 --> 01:15:35.373
And that's all I'll do.

01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:38.176
Well, don't feel generous.
It's not so much.

01:15:38.243 --> 01:15:40.545
- That's your opinion.
- Ah, the pen?

01:15:42.047 --> 01:15:44.816
Now, have you any objection
if I go on my way?

01:15:44.883 --> 01:15:47.986
Objections? Let me open
the door for you.

01:15:51.756 --> 01:15:53.091
Thank you.

01:15:53.158 --> 01:15:55.360
Come back when you
can't stay so long.

01:15:59.797 --> 01:16:02.968
Yay, I've got it. Oh.

01:16:03.034 --> 01:16:05.570
- Got what?
- Rest your eyes on that.

01:16:08.073 --> 01:16:09.875
What's the matter,
isn't it enough?

01:16:09.941 --> 01:16:11.309
I don't want any of it.

01:16:11.376 --> 01:16:13.411
What's the matter with you?
I knew it.

01:16:13.478 --> 01:16:16.247
You are carrying the torch
for that Back Bay codfish.

01:16:16.314 --> 01:16:18.416
Oh, I'm not.
I hate him.

01:16:18.483 --> 01:16:21.519
Sure you do. Why he's got
no more feelings than a hyena.

01:16:21.586 --> 01:16:23.955
He has, too. Don't you talk
that way about him.

01:16:24.022 --> 01:16:27.225
'We've just been playing him
for a sucker. He's a chump.'

01:16:27.292 --> 01:16:29.995
He's not a chump.
He's kind, and he's good.

01:16:30.061 --> 01:16:33.865
Sure, you hate him, alright.

01:16:33.932 --> 01:16:36.868
Oh, no, I don't. I love him.

01:16:36.935 --> 01:16:39.871
Oh, I've never felt
so happy in all my life.

01:16:45.210 --> 01:16:48.279
I've-I've got
a confession to make.

01:16:52.817 --> 01:16:54.085
Well?

01:16:55.486 --> 01:16:57.422
Well, I..

01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:14.539
Last night, I told
Ms. Lorraine...Trixie

01:17:14.605 --> 01:17:16.741
that I cared for her, deeply.

01:17:16.807 --> 01:17:19.577
'And she admitted
an equal affection for me.'

01:17:21.379 --> 01:17:25.816
First time in my life,
true love, real love

01:17:25.883 --> 01:17:27.452
'with a real woman.'

01:17:32.523 --> 01:17:33.524
Look.

01:17:34.592 --> 01:17:36.527
Look at that.

01:17:55.846 --> 01:17:59.217
- I've been tricked.
- You certainly have.

01:18:00.551 --> 01:18:02.087
That's the girl.

01:18:02.153 --> 01:18:04.956
That's the girl Robert
planned to marry all along.

01:18:05.023 --> 01:18:07.025
The one I intended
to save him from.

01:18:07.092 --> 01:18:10.996
No doubt about it. They've
certainly made a fool of you.

01:18:14.299 --> 01:18:16.534
- Oh, what about you?
- Who, me? Well, I..

01:18:16.601 --> 01:18:19.570
Did you know? If you knew,
why didn't you tell me?

01:18:21.272 --> 01:18:24.075
What do you think
I brought you along for, anyway?

01:18:25.576 --> 01:18:30.015
To heave ponderous, ridiculous
sighs at that giraffe?

01:18:30.081 --> 01:18:32.583
Who are you calling
a giraffe, sir?

01:18:32.650 --> 01:18:34.986
I've a suspicion
it's the woman I love.

01:18:35.053 --> 01:18:37.555
You love.
You give me a pain.

01:18:38.689 --> 01:18:40.458
You're coming along with me.

01:18:40.525 --> 01:18:42.893
I'll show them I'm not such
an easy mark.

01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:45.130
- Where to?
- To that woman's house.

01:18:45.196 --> 01:18:47.965
The one who posed
as Polly Parker, who led me on.

01:18:48.033 --> 01:18:50.068
I'm not going with you. I can't.

01:18:50.135 --> 01:18:52.237
- Why?
- Well.

01:18:52.303 --> 01:18:56.474
I have a-a dinner engagement.
A conference.

01:18:56.541 --> 01:19:00.611
Alright, I'll go by myself.
But I'll show her.

01:19:01.879 --> 01:19:04.249
I never said your brother
wanted to marry me

01:19:04.315 --> 01:19:06.284
and I never said
my name is Polly.

01:19:06.351 --> 01:19:09.520
- I took that for granted.
- You take too much for granted.

01:19:09.587 --> 01:19:11.456
I'll ask you to return my check.

01:19:11.522 --> 01:19:14.659
Your check? That's on exhibition
over there on the wall.

01:19:18.496 --> 01:19:21.066
I knew you'd probably
stop payment on it.

01:19:27.638 --> 01:19:29.274
I'll take the necessary steps--

01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:32.110
You'll do what? Listen, you made
a sap out of yourself.

01:19:32.177 --> 01:19:34.345
You tried to make
a sap out of me.

01:19:34.412 --> 01:19:36.714
I never want
to see you again, understand?

01:19:36.781 --> 01:19:39.150
And as for your check,
well, you don't think

01:19:39.217 --> 01:19:41.786
I hold myself as cheaply
as all that, do you?

01:19:41.852 --> 01:19:43.554
Cheaply? $10,000?

01:19:43.621 --> 01:19:45.790
Well, that's your estimate
of me, not mine.

01:19:45.856 --> 01:19:47.592
That check is framed,
not cashed.

01:19:47.658 --> 01:19:50.861
I put it there to remind me
never to get mixed up

01:19:50.928 --> 01:19:52.497
with your kind again.

01:19:52.563 --> 01:19:54.932
Now get out, will you
please? Get out.

01:19:54.999 --> 01:19:56.367
No, I will not get out.

01:19:56.434 --> 01:19:57.835
- You must.
- No, I will not.

01:19:57.902 --> 01:20:00.738
Not until I've told you
what I think of you.

01:20:00.805 --> 01:20:02.673
Don't you dare.
Get out.

01:20:02.740 --> 01:20:04.742
[instrumental music]

01:20:04.809 --> 01:20:07.612
I was drunk the last time.
I'm not now.

01:20:07.678 --> 01:20:11.249
I mean it.
I love you, Polly.

01:20:11.316 --> 01:20:14.819
- My name's not Polly.
- Whatever your name is.

01:20:14.885 --> 01:20:19.056
Carol, that's my name.
Cheap and vulgar Carol.

01:20:19.124 --> 01:20:20.491
Daughter of a Brooklyn
saloon keeper

01:20:20.558 --> 01:20:22.327
and a woman who took in washing.

01:20:22.393 --> 01:20:26.097
Carol, torch singer at Coney
Island. Cheap and vulgar.

01:20:26.164 --> 01:20:28.133
Every time you say
cheap and vulgar

01:20:28.199 --> 01:20:30.135
I'm going to kiss you.

01:20:30.201 --> 01:20:32.670
Cheap and vulgar.

01:20:32.737 --> 01:20:34.539
Cheap and vulgar.

01:20:34.605 --> 01:20:36.307
Cheap and vulgar.

01:20:36.374 --> 01:20:38.443
[instrumental music]

01:20:44.282 --> 01:20:46.651
I didn't mean to fall
in love with you.

01:20:46.717 --> 01:20:48.419
I was only playing a game.

01:20:48.486 --> 01:20:51.122
I didn't mean to fall
in love with you, either.

01:20:51.189 --> 01:20:54.925
I was trying to play
a little game myself.

01:20:54.992 --> 01:20:57.395
You're going to forgive
Brad and Polly, aren't you?

01:20:57.462 --> 01:20:59.697
- No, I'm not.
- Oh, but you must.

01:20:59.764 --> 01:21:01.366
- If they're married--
- Oh, they are.

01:21:01.432 --> 01:21:03.201
They phoned me
from the city hall.

01:21:03.268 --> 01:21:04.902
I'll have
their marriage annulled.

01:21:04.969 --> 01:21:07.738
- Oh, but you said--
- I don't care what I said.

01:21:07.805 --> 01:21:10.275
I was confused, upset.

01:21:10.341 --> 01:21:13.211
Well, maybe
you're confused about us.

01:21:13.278 --> 01:21:15.380
No, that's one thing
I'm sure about.

01:21:15.446 --> 01:21:18.183
But their marriage is off,
definitely off.

01:21:18.249 --> 01:21:20.518
Well, then so is ours.

01:21:20.585 --> 01:21:23.588
- You mean you won't marry me?
- I certainly do.

01:21:23.654 --> 01:21:25.556
- Oh, I'm late. The show. Sorry.
- Polly--

01:21:25.623 --> 01:21:27.625
- 'See you later.'
- Carol.

01:21:27.692 --> 01:21:30.628
'You haven't told me. We've got
to settle this, Carol.'

01:28:27.678 --> 01:28:29.313
Congratulate us.
We are man and wife.

01:28:29.379 --> 01:28:31.782
- No, you're not.
- I should know, I'm the bride.

01:28:31.849 --> 01:28:33.483
Oh, Trixie, I'm so glad.

01:28:33.550 --> 01:28:36.453
- We're married, too.
- My heartiest congratulations.

01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:39.056
- Same to you, Peabody.
- Oh, isn't it wonderful?

- At my age?
- Oh, at any age.

Oh, come on, honey.

Good girl. Keep him
close to home.

Here, wait a minute.

I understand
you two are married.

01:28:57.441 --> 01:29:01.045
- I'm going to have it annulled.
- You can't annul our marriage.

01:29:01.111 --> 01:29:02.980
Not yours stupid.
His.

01:29:03.047 --> 01:29:05.249
- You can't do that.
- Yes, I can.

01:29:13.924 --> 01:29:15.660
[orchestral music]

01:29:15.726 --> 01:29:18.095
You've interfered enough. We're
married and gonna stay married.

01:29:18.162 --> 01:29:19.930
Today you asked me to marry you.

01:29:19.997 --> 01:29:21.365
- He did?
- Yes, he did.

01:29:21.431 --> 01:29:23.901
Yes, I proposed and was sincere.

01:29:23.968 --> 01:29:27.571
If you do this I won't marry you
if you were the last man.

01:29:27.638 --> 01:29:29.206
I told you once and meant it.

01:29:29.273 --> 01:29:31.441
Much as I love you,
nevertheless, I am determined

01:29:31.508 --> 01:29:34.278
to look after his interests
whether he likes it or not.

01:29:34.344 --> 01:29:36.246
- Arrest him.
- 'You have a warrant?'

01:29:36.313 --> 01:29:39.717
Perjury. Falsification of age
in obtaining a marriage license.

01:29:39.784 --> 01:29:41.185
You can't hold me on that.

01:29:41.251 --> 01:29:43.921
Technically we can,
pending an investigation.

01:29:43.988 --> 01:29:45.956
Oh, Brad, what are we
going to do?

01:29:46.023 --> 01:29:48.192
What's holding up the show?
You wanna ruin me?

01:29:48.258 --> 01:29:50.627
My brother just had me arrested
for getting married.

01:29:50.695 --> 01:29:51.896
Arrested?
Where's the cop?

01:29:51.962 --> 01:29:54.231
- Here he is.
- Detective Jones.

01:29:54.298 --> 01:29:57.034
Detective, my eye.
He's a ham actor.

01:29:57.101 --> 01:29:59.169
That's no way
to speak of an artist.

01:29:59.236 --> 01:30:01.205
Why, I've played
with Sir Henry Irving

01:30:01.271 --> 01:30:04.675
George Arliss
and David Warfield.

01:30:04.742 --> 01:30:06.476
Scram. You're a washout.

01:30:06.543 --> 01:30:09.113
You've been playing cops
on Broadway for 25 years.

01:30:09.179 --> 01:30:11.916
- Snitch.
- Get out and do your number.

01:30:11.982 --> 01:30:13.117
Is everybody nutty?

01:30:13.183 --> 01:30:15.085
- Here.
- What's this?

01:30:15.152 --> 01:30:18.155
'I'm sure Carol will endorse it
to you for a wedding present.'

01:30:18.222 --> 01:30:20.858
Ten thousand dollars.
What a brother.

01:30:20.925 --> 01:30:23.460
You mean, what a sister-in-law.

01:30:23.527 --> 01:30:26.764
You mean, what a Fanny.

01:30:32.469 --> 01:30:34.839

01:30:38.776 --> 01:30:41.245

01:30:59.730 --> 01:31:01.899
[music continues]

01:31:07.704 --> 01:31:11.008
I don't know if he
deserves a bit of sympathy.

01:31:12.042 --> 01:31:14.779
Forget your sympathy.

01:31:14.845 --> 01:31:17.982
It's alright with me.

01:31:18.048 --> 01:31:21.251
I was satisfied to drift along
from day to day.

01:31:22.887 --> 01:31:26.757
Till they came
and...took my man away.

01:31:29.626 --> 01:31:31.929
"Remember my forgotten man.

01:31:34.631 --> 01:31:37.434
"You put a rifle in his hand.

01:31:40.404 --> 01:31:42.840
"You sent him far away.

01:31:42.907 --> 01:31:46.310
"You shouted, hip, hooray!

01:31:46.376 --> 01:31:48.445
"But look at him today.

01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:53.350
"Remember my forgotten man.

01:31:55.152 --> 01:31:57.855
"You had him cultivate the land.

01:32:00.825 --> 01:32:05.529
"He walked behind a plow.
The sweat fell from his brow.

01:32:07.264 --> 01:32:09.867
"But look at him right now.

"I was happy then.

01:32:24.849 --> 01:32:27.284
