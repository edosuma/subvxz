00:04.671 --> 00:07.590
[Marshall] <i>Halloween has always been</i>
<i>my favorite holiday.</i>

00:07.674 --> 00:09.968
-<i>What I love about it: the scares.</i>
-[growls]

00:10.051 --> 00:12.137
<i>That was me, Marshall, a year ago.</i>

00:12.220 --> 00:14.097
<i>And those are</i>
<i>my two best friends, Gilbert…</i>

00:14.180 --> 00:16.224
And I have a hunch this is a bad idea.

00:16.307 --> 00:18.435
-[Marshall] <i>…and Amy.</i>
-Future investigative reporter.

00:18.935 --> 00:21.438
[Marshall] <i>Last year</i>
<i>was the craziest Halloween ever.</i>

00:21.521 --> 00:23.023
-[screams]
-<i>We accidentally woke up</i>

00:23.106 --> 00:25.275
-<i>an ancient Egyptian mummy.</i>
-[roars]

00:25.358 --> 00:27.861
<i>We all thought he was gonna be</i>
<i>totally mean and evil.</i>

00:27.944 --> 00:30.405
-<i>Turns out he was just a big sweetheart.</i>
-[groans]

00:30.488 --> 00:31.531
<i>I nicknamed him Harold.</i>

00:31.614 --> 00:32.991
Marshall?

00:33.074 --> 00:36.077
<i>He became our friend.</i>
<i>A really awesome friend.</i>

00:36.161 --> 00:37.328
-[burps]
-[groans]

00:37.412 --> 00:42.042
<i>But then our pal, Buzzy, figured out</i>
<i>that Harold only had three days to live.</i>

00:42.125 --> 00:45.628
<i>He had to be back in his coffin</i>
<i>before midnight on the third day or…</i>

00:45.712 --> 00:47.464
-He could turn to dust.
-[groans]

00:47.547 --> 00:51.551
<i>So we said our goodbyes and got him back</i>
<i>to the museum just in the nick of time,</i>

00:51.634 --> 00:54.429
<i>where he could be with the love</i>
<i>of his life for all eternity.</i>

00:54.971 --> 00:57.265
<i>So how are we gonna top</i>
<i>Halloween this year?</i>

00:57.348 --> 00:59.309
<i>No idea. But tag along.</i>

00:59.809 --> 01:01.936
<i>I dare you.</i> [chuckles]

01:10.403 --> 01:11.613
[crow cawing]

01:19.079 --> 01:20.955
[Amy] I really think we're lost.

01:21.039 --> 01:24.375
[Marshall] Yeah, we are definitely lost.
And this place is really creepy.

01:26.211 --> 01:30.048
[Gilbert] Well, if we spot anything weird,
don't worry. I'm ready to film it.

01:30.131 --> 01:32.300
[Marshall] And that's supposed to
make me feel better?

01:32.383 --> 01:34.010
[Amy] Come on, guys. Let's keep going.

01:40.141 --> 01:42.143
[snarling]

01:43.311 --> 01:44.437
[Amy] What was that?

01:44.521 --> 01:46.397
[Marshall] Nothing. I hope.

01:46.481 --> 01:48.942
[thudding, growling]

01:49.025 --> 01:50.777
[Amy] That was definitely not nothing.

01:51.778 --> 01:54.155
[Marshall] It's time to go. Like, now.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.282
[Amy] Shh. Listen. It stopped.

02:00.578 --> 02:01.955
-[snarling]
-[Gilbert, Marshall gasp]

02:05.875 --> 02:07.585
-[roars]
-[children scream]

02:10.797 --> 02:12.715
-[werewolf howls]
-[Amy screams]

02:14.425 --> 02:16.719
-[Gilbert] Which way should we go?
-[scarecrow laughs]

02:16.803 --> 02:18.471
[growls, laughs]

02:18.555 --> 02:20.431
-[screaming]
-[chuckles, grunts]

02:20.932 --> 02:21.891
[Marshall] Run!

02:21.975 --> 02:23.685
-[children gasp]
-[monsters growling]

02:23.768 --> 02:25.228
-[zombie] Brains!
-[Gilbert screams]

02:25.311 --> 02:26.896
-[scarecrow laughing]
-[Amy screams]

02:30.567 --> 02:32.443
-[monsters growling]
-[children screaming]

02:33.987 --> 02:34.988
[growling stops]

02:35.071 --> 02:37.574
[announcer] <i>The haunted corn maze</i>
<i>is now closed.</i>

02:37.657 --> 02:39.993
-<i>Please proceed to the exit.</i>
-[zombies sighing]

02:40.076 --> 02:41.077
[zombie 1] Finally.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.121
I gotta get to my shift at Burger Shack.

02:43.204 --> 02:45.165
-See you.
-Yeah. I'm gonna stop by later.

02:45.248 --> 02:46.541
[scarecrow] Sounds good.

02:46.624 --> 02:47.876
[shudders]

02:47.959 --> 02:50.753
They look even scarier in the light
than in the dark.

02:52.046 --> 02:54.174
Not that I was afraid or anything.
[chuckles]

02:59.137 --> 03:00.430
[howling]

03:00.513 --> 03:02.682
[Gilbert] All right, fam,
so as you can see,

03:02.765 --> 03:07.061
I, Gutsy Gilbert, have easily conquered
the Walgrove Horror Corn Maze.

03:07.145 --> 03:09.939
Until next time, stay gutsy!

03:10.023 --> 03:11.191
[chuckling]

03:11.816 --> 03:15.236
Guys, that was awesome.
I'm really happy we did this together.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.988
-[Amy] Me too.
-[Gilbert] Me three.

03:17.071 --> 03:19.532
I wish they weren't closing
so we could do it again.

03:19.616 --> 03:23.036
Yeah, Gilbert, I still can't believe
you used to be afraid of everything,

03:23.119 --> 03:25.496
and now you review scary things
for the school paper.

03:25.580 --> 03:28.458
This maze was up there.
I give it three screams for sure.

03:28.541 --> 03:31.794
I mean, between his videos and my stories,
we can't be stopped.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.379
And this one is gonna be great.

03:33.463 --> 03:36.132
It's even better than
the 24-hour horror-thon.

03:38.801 --> 03:39.802
[growling on screen]

03:39.886 --> 03:40.762
Or the bungee jump.

03:41.804 --> 03:42.847
[screaming]

03:44.682 --> 03:46.184
Or that time I had to eat…

03:48.603 --> 03:49.979
[groans] I can't even say it.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.648
[scoffs] Yeah, look, Gil,

03:51.731 --> 03:54.067
I think you've proven
that you can handle being scared.

03:54.150 --> 03:55.902
You know you don't have to
keep doing this, right?

03:55.985 --> 03:57.779
I do so have to keep doing this.

03:57.862 --> 04:00.907
Like you said,
I was the town scaredy-cat for years.

04:00.990 --> 04:02.700
People need to know that's the old me.

04:02.784 --> 04:05.495
They definitely do.
The Gutsy Gilbert videos are, like,

04:05.578 --> 04:07.580
the most watched thing
on the school paper's website.

04:07.664 --> 04:08.998
But also, it's fun.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.542
Marsh,
you always said being scared is fun.

04:11.626 --> 04:14.837
Remember? "Face your fears.
We're big world people."

04:14.921 --> 04:19.008
Yeah, look, I know, but not all the time.
You can take breaks.

04:19.092 --> 04:20.635
You're not getting one this weekend.

04:20.718 --> 04:23.054
Speaking of, I still need to pack.
Don't want to show up

04:23.137 --> 04:25.932
at your dad's wedding
looking anything less than smashing.

04:26.015 --> 04:30.603
And because Pops and his fiancé, Carl,
are getting married on Halloween,

04:30.687 --> 04:32.146
they're calling it

04:32.230 --> 04:34.607
-the "Hallowedding!"
-The "Hallowedding!"

04:35.733 --> 04:38.111
Amy, I don't even know
how you put this together.

04:38.194 --> 04:39.654
Really? I don't know, it's a lot of work.

04:42.407 --> 04:43.992
The best part is that Pop and Carl

04:44.075 --> 04:46.536
put me in charge of the welcome party
the night before.

04:46.619 --> 04:49.289
It will be Halloween themed, of course,
with spooky treats,

04:49.372 --> 04:51.207
everyone in costume, the works.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.168
And I'm gonna call it "Shocktail Hour."

04:54.252 --> 04:56.045
-Ooh. I like that.
-Yeah. And you two

04:56.129 --> 04:57.797
are gonna help me make it happen.

04:57.880 --> 05:00.008
This is gonna be a busy vacation.

05:00.091 --> 05:02.176
I'm just glad we built in time
to go see Harold.

05:02.260 --> 05:06.014
Of course. Harold and Rose's exhibit is at
the Rockport Museum of Natural History

05:06.097 --> 05:08.474
for a few more weeks, so works out great.

05:08.558 --> 05:09.642
Who's Rose?

05:11.060 --> 05:12.520
[both] Oh.

05:12.603 --> 05:13.980
We gave Harold's girlfriend a name.

05:14.063 --> 05:15.440
-After my aunt Rosie.
-Yeah.

05:16.065 --> 05:17.066
Cool.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.901
It's just, nobody told me.

05:21.446 --> 05:24.490
Anyway, I really want to wake up Harold.

05:24.574 --> 05:25.700
I miss him so much.

05:25.783 --> 05:26.993
We all do.

05:27.076 --> 05:30.413
But they have to rest side by side
in order to be together in the afterlife.

05:30.496 --> 05:33.499
You know,
gotta respect that eternal slumber.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.793
[chuckles] I'll see you guys
at school tomorrow.

05:35.877 --> 05:39.213
-Secret newspaper handshake?
-Secret newspaper handshake.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.632
[Gilbert] Oh, oh. Oh, oh.

05:41.716 --> 05:43.092
-[growls]
-[screams]

05:43.176 --> 05:44.969
[both] Oh, oh, oh, oh!

05:45.053 --> 05:46.387
[chuckling]

05:46.471 --> 05:49.974
You two know it's not secret
if you announce it, right?

05:50.683 --> 05:52.393
We know we can trust you. [chuckles]

05:52.477 --> 05:53.811
-Good night.
-Good night.

06:18.586 --> 06:19.754
[sighs]

06:19.837 --> 06:21.381
Stupid internship.

06:21.464 --> 06:24.092
They got me working the night shift.
Not even getting paid.

06:24.675 --> 06:27.345
[sighs] Man,
I could barely afford this sandwich.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.723
-[meatball thuds]
-My meatball!

06:31.224 --> 06:32.892
No! [groans]

06:34.894 --> 06:36.646
It's really under there.

06:40.942 --> 06:41.984
[groans]

06:42.944 --> 06:44.779
[grunting] Okay.

06:44.862 --> 06:46.072
[grunting, straining]

06:57.667 --> 07:00.336
[grunts, chuckles]

07:00.420 --> 07:01.337
Gotcha!

07:01.421 --> 07:02.422
Ugh.

07:03.131 --> 07:04.882
Hmm, 25-second rule.

07:04.966 --> 07:06.175
Still good.

07:08.219 --> 07:09.846
Come to papa.

07:12.348 --> 07:14.183
About to tear this up.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.647
Mm-hmm. I got all three
of my meatballs back, baby.

07:23.401 --> 07:25.319
[groans]

07:29.115 --> 07:30.616
[grunting]

07:33.244 --> 07:34.620
-[yelps]
-[growls]

07:35.455 --> 07:36.497
[snickers]

07:36.581 --> 07:39.792
Okay. Come on, y'all.
Where are the hidden cameras, everybody?

07:39.876 --> 07:42.044
[stammers] Esteban, is that you?

07:42.128 --> 07:44.046
[growls]

07:44.130 --> 07:46.048
Okay, dummy mummy,
I got something for you.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.467
[growls]

07:48.968 --> 07:52.513
[groans, growls]

07:52.597 --> 07:53.681
You're not Esteban.

07:54.849 --> 07:56.309
No heartbeat.

07:57.226 --> 07:59.145
You're not alive.

08:00.146 --> 08:02.315
[yelps] What are you doing?

08:02.398 --> 08:03.733
No, wait!

08:16.245 --> 08:20.208
Hello, Sobek, O Great One.

08:20.291 --> 08:21.792
[roars]

08:21.876 --> 08:23.377
How may I do your bidding?

08:26.714 --> 08:30.259
You wish to spend eternity
resting by the love of your life.

08:31.052 --> 08:33.638
And get revenge on your best friend
who betrayed you.

08:33.721 --> 08:34.764
[roars]

08:34.847 --> 08:37.725
And you will stop at nothing
to make it happen.

08:39.018 --> 08:40.937
No problemo.

08:43.231 --> 08:46.817
Uh, what's wrong? Did you lose something?
Your cell phone? Wallet? Your keys?

08:46.901 --> 08:48.277
[grunts]

08:50.947 --> 08:52.365
[grunts]

08:52.448 --> 08:53.908
[growls]

08:54.617 --> 08:55.743
Ah.

08:55.826 --> 08:57.954
That's you.

08:58.037 --> 09:00.706
Oh, now I know what you were looking for.

09:00.790 --> 09:05.419
You already have your assistant,
but you need your staff.

09:06.170 --> 09:07.171
[grunts]

09:07.255 --> 09:08.965
Did His Excellency get my joke?

09:09.048 --> 09:10.007
[groans]

09:10.091 --> 09:14.136
It's a homonym.
A "staff" has dual meanings as a-- Okay.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.850
[bell rings]

09:26.148 --> 09:27.149
Hey, fam.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.653
-No, no signs of a break-in.
-Interesting.

09:30.736 --> 09:33.698
Buzzy just got a new crate
of fake eyeballs down at the shop.

09:33.781 --> 09:35.700
Want to go see if anything looks good?

09:37.201 --> 09:40.162
No, we just got something weird.

09:40.246 --> 09:43.374
I have alerts set up
to report any mummy-related activity.

09:43.457 --> 09:45.459
After everything that went down
with Harold last year,

09:45.543 --> 09:47.336
I decided to keep close tabs
on the mummy world.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.547
You know, just to make sure
he's not in danger.

09:49.630 --> 09:52.466
Anyway, this was today's news.

09:53.718 --> 09:56.095
[Marshall] "Mummy disappears from museum."

09:56.178 --> 09:58.931
Balderston's, like, a billion miles away
from Rockport.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.725
What does this have to do with us?

10:00.808 --> 10:04.478
Because we get nervous
when Egyptian antiquities disappear.

10:04.562 --> 10:07.607
After all, some of our best friends
are Egyptian antiquities.

10:07.690 --> 10:10.818
Wait, you guys don't think someone's
gonna try to steal Harold, do you?

10:10.901 --> 10:14.530
Because last time I checked,
Killbot and Ravensworth are still in jail.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.532
Yeah, we were just talking about that.

10:16.616 --> 10:20.286
Yeah, but the thing is, there were no
external signs of a break-in.

10:20.369 --> 10:23.789
Then it must have been
an inside job, right?

10:24.832 --> 10:26.167
Maybe.

10:26.250 --> 10:30.171
We'll keep an eye on this. But for now,
Marshall, we will see you tomorrow

10:30.254 --> 10:32.965
bright and early
for the big voyage to Rockport.

10:33.049 --> 10:35.509
Come on, Amy. Let's finish cutting down
the corn maze video.

10:35.593 --> 10:36.927
Content never sleeps!

10:37.011 --> 10:38.387
You've got it, Gutsy.

10:39.263 --> 10:41.015
All right. See you guys tomorrow.

10:41.098 --> 10:42.558
-[Amy] Bye.
-[Gilbert] See you.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.810
-[Marshall on video] <i>…definitely lost.</i>
-This is gonna be great.

10:44.894 --> 10:47.063
You know what else is great?
My face right here.

10:47.146 --> 10:49.565
-[yelps] <i>Which way should we go?</i>
-[laughing]

10:49.649 --> 10:51.609
-[growling]
-Yeah, can you get the time stamp?

10:51.692 --> 10:52.735
-Yeah.
-Okay.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.781
[intern] Worry not, Sobek,
we will find our way back

10:56.864 --> 10:58.908
to that cursed Route 18.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.994
Got it. We are unlost.

11:02.078 --> 11:03.079
[grunts]

11:03.579 --> 11:06.749
Oh. Oh, but of course.
Your majestic legs need room to stretch.

11:06.832 --> 11:09.251
So there's gonna be a switch,
and then that's gonna put you--

11:09.335 --> 11:11.671
-[grunts]
-Okay, I got it. Here we go.

11:12.254 --> 11:13.756
-[groans]
-Sorry about that.

11:13.839 --> 11:16.592
That-- I'm so sorry.
It's gotta be broken. Okay.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.512
It shouldn't-- I don't get what it-- Nope.

11:19.595 --> 11:22.598
It's gotta be my left hand.
It-- It should not be doing that!

11:22.682 --> 11:24.433
I just gotta tune the--

11:26.185 --> 11:29.397
A thousand million "kajillion" pardons,
O Magnificent One.

11:30.064 --> 11:32.024
[growls]

11:32.108 --> 11:35.069
Anyway, now that you are comfy cozy,

11:35.152 --> 11:37.863
I am pleased to announce
that I have located

11:37.947 --> 11:40.783
your majestic, bejeweled staff.

11:40.866 --> 11:44.286
It is at the classy private estate
of antiquities collector,

11:44.370 --> 11:47.915
Jonathan Manchester Wilcox,
and we are headed there right now.

11:47.998 --> 11:49.208
[grunts]

11:49.291 --> 11:52.795
And then we will travel on to Rockport,
where your sworn enemy will be vanquished,

11:52.878 --> 11:55.965
and you will lie beside your one true love
for all eternity.

11:56.674 --> 11:58.342
[gauge beeping]

11:59.552 --> 12:01.011
Also we should get gas.

12:01.095 --> 12:03.764
I don't suppose Your Amazingness
has a few bucks to kick in?

12:03.848 --> 12:05.641
-[roars]
-Just checking.

12:07.393 --> 12:08.519
-[grunts]
-Oh.

12:08.602 --> 12:10.771
You just take a little nappy.
I'll get us there.

12:10.855 --> 12:12.606
[exhaust backfires]

12:21.282 --> 12:26.036
♪ <i>Have yourself a happy Halloween</i> ♪

12:26.537 --> 12:28.706
It's pretty cool our parents
let you chaperone this weekend, Buzzy.

12:28.789 --> 12:30.040
Yeah, I'm hype.

12:30.124 --> 12:34.670
I love a good wedding. Or a bad wedding.
Mostly, I love free snacks.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.756
-That makes two of us.
-[Buzzy chuckles]

12:36.839 --> 12:38.883
How about you, Amy? You pumped?

12:41.302 --> 12:43.471
-Amy?
-"Sobek"…

12:43.554 --> 12:44.972
Gesundheit?

12:45.055 --> 12:48.267
More info came out about the mummy
that vanished from the museum.

12:48.350 --> 12:53.397
Apparently, he's from the same century
as Harold and Rose, and his name is Sobek.

12:53.481 --> 12:56.776
Ugh. He looks bad. Cool eye patch though.

12:57.359 --> 12:58.527
[Amy] Whoa.

12:58.611 --> 12:59.904
Apparently he wasn't always bad,

12:59.987 --> 13:03.699
because it says here
that he was Harold's best friend.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.202
This website
has a translation of his diary.

13:06.285 --> 13:10.831
Sobek was an adviser to Rose's family
and was the one person Harold confided in

13:10.915 --> 13:12.541
about his forbidden love for Rose.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.419
Whoa.
They must have been best, best friends.

13:15.503 --> 13:19.173
But it looks like
Sobek was also in love with Rose.

13:19.256 --> 13:21.592
And he was so upset
that Rose rejected him,

13:21.675 --> 13:23.511
he became Harold's bitter rival.

13:24.094 --> 13:26.889
Sobek swore that if it took him
a thousand lifetimes,

13:26.972 --> 13:28.641
he would get his revenge.

13:28.724 --> 13:31.018
Whoa. That is so many lifetimes.

13:31.101 --> 13:35.231
So, a mummy that Harold and Rose
personally knew has been stolen?

13:36.065 --> 13:38.734
I don't like that.
I don't like any of this.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.402
Our friends could be in danger.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.363
I'm just glad we're going
to the museum today.

13:48.786 --> 13:50.329
Do you guys see this?

13:51.455 --> 13:52.456
Whoa.

13:52.540 --> 13:53.874
Welcome to Rockport.

13:59.004 --> 14:00.548
[Marshall chuckles]

14:00.631 --> 14:03.634
Amy, y'all really do go all out
for scary season, huh?

14:06.136 --> 14:07.513
-[child 1] Yay!
-[child 2] So cool!

14:07.596 --> 14:10.891
Amy, if this is Rockport,
I don't think I'm ever leaving.

14:10.975 --> 14:13.060
Whoa. [chuckles]

14:14.061 --> 14:15.062
Awesome!

14:20.317 --> 14:21.610
That's our hotel.

14:22.695 --> 14:23.946
[Marshall] No way.

14:25.072 --> 14:27.032
[Buzzy] This is a dream come true.

14:31.328 --> 14:32.830
This is awesome.

14:34.331 --> 14:37.877
Geez, Marshall.
This place is like being inside your head.

14:38.627 --> 14:42.006
-I know! I may never leave.
-[Amy chuckles]

14:43.173 --> 14:45.217
-Pop! Carl! [laughs]
-[Pop] Amy!

14:45.301 --> 14:46.927
Good to see you, girl.

14:47.011 --> 14:49.889
-So glad you're here.
-Hey, Pop, wouldn't miss it for anything.

14:49.972 --> 14:53.267
-Oh, and about the chocolate fountain--
-Don't worry. We've got it under control.

14:53.350 --> 14:55.603
Excuse me. I may not be as exciting
as a chocolate fountain,

14:55.686 --> 14:56.896
but I think maybe I should get a hug?

14:56.979 --> 14:59.398
Hi, Carl. Happy wedding weekend.

14:59.481 --> 15:02.985
Oh, and, uh, Pop and Carl,
this is Buzzy, Gilbert and Marshall.

15:03.068 --> 15:04.069
Oh, of course.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.362
-Gutsy Gilbert!
-Gutsy Gilbert!

15:05.446 --> 15:08.490
Amy's told us a bunch about you.
Can't wait to see the corn maze video.

15:08.574 --> 15:11.035
Oh! Thank you, guys.
Always nice to meet a fan.

15:11.118 --> 15:14.163
And Marshall, we're looking forward
to getting to know you

15:14.246 --> 15:15.748
-a little better this weekend too.
-Awesome.

15:15.831 --> 15:17.833
I have a million things
to tell you about Shocktail Hour.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.585
And we can't wait to hear all of them.

15:19.668 --> 15:22.129
But first, you still good to go pick up
the rings from the jewelers?

15:22.212 --> 15:23.714
They said they'd be done
with the engraving--

15:23.797 --> 15:26.467
6:30 p.m. Bueller's Jewelers,
North Main Street. We'll be there.

15:26.550 --> 15:28.761
-[Carl sighs]
-I don't know what we'd do without you.

15:28.844 --> 15:31.013
We'd love it if you could hang on to them
until the wedding.

15:31.096 --> 15:32.556
We have a lot to keep track of.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.975
I will guard them with my life. I promise.

15:35.059 --> 15:37.436
-This weekend is going to be amazing.
-[chuckles] Yeah.

15:37.519 --> 15:40.189
Well, now that you're here,
it's gonna be better than amazing.

15:40.272 --> 15:44.276
Buzzy, we checked you in.
There's your room key.

15:44.360 --> 15:48.072
-Nice earrings.
-Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

15:48.155 --> 15:49.281
[all laugh]

15:49.365 --> 15:51.909
-Okay, troops, let's move out.
-[Gilbert] All right.

15:55.037 --> 15:57.831
[Carl sighs] That is an incredible kid.

15:57.915 --> 16:00.042
-Yeah, she takes after me.
-[chuckles]

16:00.125 --> 16:03.003
[Gilbert] Wow, Amy.
There's already so much going on.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.255
It's pretty amazing
you're taking on this party.

16:05.339 --> 16:07.549
Yeah, don't you want to chill out
and enjoy the weekend?

16:07.633 --> 16:08.759
This is my gift to them.

16:08.842 --> 16:12.471
I'm a kid. I can't buy them
a honeymoon vacation or whatever.

16:12.554 --> 16:14.556
But I can throw them an amazing party.

16:14.640 --> 16:17.226
And I promise you,
it will be unforgettable.

16:25.317 --> 16:26.318
[Buzzy] This is it.

16:27.611 --> 16:30.114
-[gasps] Oh, my God!
-[Gilbert, Amy] Wow.

16:30.197 --> 16:31.740
[Gilbert] So, this is all for us?

16:33.075 --> 16:35.077
I'm definitely never leaving.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.161
[machine beeping]

16:36.245 --> 16:38.706
Me and Buzzy will take that bedroom.
You guys take the other.

16:38.789 --> 16:39.790
[both giggle]

16:39.873 --> 16:41.917
Ooh. And I'll take the snack bar.

16:42.001 --> 16:45.295
And if we get tired of that,
we can order room service with this thing.

16:45.963 --> 16:47.798
This place is the best.

16:48.382 --> 16:51.301
The toilet has blue water and Bluetooth.
[gasps]

16:51.385 --> 16:54.430
-Why does a toilet need Bluetooth?
-I don't know.

16:54.513 --> 16:56.890
I just know
I can never live without one again.

17:00.310 --> 17:02.938
[Bueller] Here you are.
Your fathers' wedding rings.

17:03.647 --> 17:08.569
Well, shape of the ring box
was a unique thing to custom order.

17:09.236 --> 17:11.155
And I think it looks great.

17:12.156 --> 17:15.159
These are perfect. Thank you.

17:15.242 --> 17:17.703
Guys, check these out. Guys?

17:18.287 --> 17:20.289
We found a few more pictures
of that Sobek guy.

17:20.372 --> 17:24.001
He has an amulet exactly
like Harold and Rose's, only it's red.

17:24.084 --> 17:28.380
I've never seen a jewel that red.
It's almost scary.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.049
Mind if I take a look?

17:32.801 --> 17:35.304
Of course. Red jasper.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.390
[inhales sharply] Nasty stuff.

17:40.601 --> 17:42.770
Jewels are my business,
and I do love them all.

17:42.853 --> 17:46.899
But wherever red jasper goes,
there's always trouble.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.318
Wait, really?

17:49.401 --> 17:52.780
You were talking about a mummy?
Well, in ancient Egypt,

17:52.863 --> 17:56.492
the color red represented chaos
and destruction.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.535
Anybody buried with that…

17:59.536 --> 18:01.622
was planning on
being up to no good for eternity.

18:01.705 --> 18:06.126
If it took him a thousand lifetimes,
Sobek swore he'd get his revenge.

18:06.210 --> 18:10.714
And his amulet is just like
Harold and Rose's, except evil.

18:10.798 --> 18:12.466
And there was no sign of a break-in.

18:13.050 --> 18:15.469
Guys, I don't think Sobek was stolen.

18:15.552 --> 18:17.387
I think he was revived.

18:18.555 --> 18:20.808
That means
we need to protect Harold and Rose.

18:20.891 --> 18:24.186
And that means we need to wake them up
as soon as possible. Let's go.

18:24.269 --> 18:25.729
-Okay. Go, go, go!
-[Amy] Thank you.

18:25.813 --> 18:27.147
[Gilbert] Thank you.

18:27.856 --> 18:28.857
Revived?

18:41.662 --> 18:42.663
Everyone ready?

18:42.746 --> 18:45.582
Okay. The museum is officially closed.

18:45.666 --> 18:49.586
-Everyone clear on the plan?
-One special delivery, coming right up.

18:49.670 --> 18:50.879
[grunts]

18:52.422 --> 18:53.507
[door buzzes]

18:57.094 --> 18:58.095
Can I help you?

18:58.178 --> 19:02.891
Yeah, I got a late delivery of clothing
and textile samples for the Roman exhibit?

19:04.101 --> 19:06.061
-You can just sign for it.
-Oh, no, no, no.

19:06.145 --> 19:09.565
My orders were to bring it
to the exhibit directly.

19:09.648 --> 19:13.986
-I don't have any record of that.
-That's right. My boss, she talked to her.

19:14.069 --> 19:15.529
And who's "her"?

19:16.363 --> 19:20.450
Delia Henson? The curator? Your boss?

19:23.453 --> 19:24.454
Be quick about it.

19:25.289 --> 19:26.290
Can do.

19:28.792 --> 19:31.712
-[Marshall] Are we there yet?
-[Buzzy] Shh. We're almost there.

19:32.296 --> 19:33.714
Here we go.

19:34.548 --> 19:36.425
[grunting] Come on!

19:41.889 --> 19:44.016
Okay, guys. We're here.

19:48.437 --> 19:49.980
[Marshall] Come on. Let's go.

19:54.067 --> 19:57.738
Hey, guys. It's me, Marshall.
It's so good to see you.

19:58.405 --> 20:01.783
How are we gonna bring them back to life
if the moonlight's all the way over there?

20:01.867 --> 20:04.077
I already thought of that.
I brought mirrors.

20:04.995 --> 20:05.996
Mirrors?

20:06.079 --> 20:09.750
Mirrors. We will bring the moonlight
to the mummies.

20:09.833 --> 20:11.835
Oh. Okay.

20:13.462 --> 20:14.755
[Amy] Okay.

20:15.339 --> 20:16.548
[clears throat]

20:24.223 --> 20:26.350
Come on, moonlight. Come on, moonlight!

20:34.942 --> 20:36.526
-Harold!
-[gasps]

20:37.027 --> 20:38.904
-[groaning]
-Hey.

20:39.529 --> 20:41.031
[grunting]

20:41.573 --> 20:43.742
Shh. We don't want the guard to hear us.

20:43.825 --> 20:45.661
[distant groaning]

20:47.162 --> 20:49.498
-[Marshall] Shh, shh. Shh, shh.
-[groaning continues]

20:51.166 --> 20:52.334
I missed you, big guy.

20:55.045 --> 20:56.546
Oh! Okay, too tight, buddy.

20:58.465 --> 21:00.634
-[Amy] Hi, Harold.
-[Buzzy] Hi, Harold.

21:00.717 --> 21:02.386
-[groans]
-Hey, Harold.

21:03.345 --> 21:05.305
Come on. We need to wake up Rose now.

21:14.856 --> 21:16.483
[groaning]

21:16.566 --> 21:17.609
[sighs]

21:17.693 --> 21:19.403
[both grunting]

21:27.494 --> 21:28.370
Hi, Rose.

21:28.453 --> 21:31.081
Guys, we gotta get the "mummy-quins."
Come on!

21:38.463 --> 21:40.215
-You like these?
-[both gasp]

21:40.299 --> 21:42.801
We'll put them in your place
so no one will notice you're gone.

21:42.884 --> 21:45.053
I think I did a pretty good job
making them look like you

21:45.137 --> 21:46.555
on such short notice.

21:52.769 --> 21:53.770
Hello?

21:53.854 --> 21:57.441
Okay-- Hurry, hurry! We have to finish
the mummy-quins and get out of here!

21:59.985 --> 22:02.446
-[Harold groaning]
-[Buzzy straining] Too heavy.

22:02.529 --> 22:06.742
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait, Harold.
We need you to be the getaway driver.

22:08.869 --> 22:11.371
-[straining]
-[Marshall] Where are we going?

22:11.455 --> 22:14.082
I think there's an exit
at the loading dock in the back. That way.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.876
[Harold grunting]

22:15.959 --> 22:18.003
-[Marshall] Harold, not so loud.
-[Harold grunts]

22:27.054 --> 22:28.055
Hmm.

22:39.232 --> 22:41.693
[Amy] Harold, make a right
at the bottom of this ramp.

22:41.777 --> 22:43.278
[groans]

22:43.362 --> 22:45.572
-Whoa. Hey, Harold! Harold!
-[Gilbert] Harold?

22:45.655 --> 22:46.656
[all screaming]

22:53.205 --> 22:54.414
No! Lean!

22:58.835 --> 23:03.131
You know, I used to always think
museums were boring. Not anymore.

23:05.592 --> 23:06.635
[distant screaming]

23:07.719 --> 23:08.929
Did you hear something?

23:09.012 --> 23:10.555
-Look out!
-[Marshall] We're gonna crash!

23:10.639 --> 23:11.932
[roaring]

23:15.602 --> 23:17.020
[Marshall] Huh? Huh?

23:18.146 --> 23:19.147
[groans]

23:19.648 --> 23:20.649
[Amy] Harold.

23:21.900 --> 23:24.027
That was awesome! [laughs]

23:30.409 --> 23:31.410
Hmm.

23:33.328 --> 23:34.871
[Buzzy] Move! Hurry!

23:34.955 --> 23:36.790
Oh, wow! We did it!

23:38.875 --> 23:43.463
Well, I defy anyone to pull off
a smoother antiquities-related heist

23:44.005 --> 23:45.006
tonight.

23:54.391 --> 23:58.145
Okay, before we go any further,
most mightiest of Sobeks,

23:58.228 --> 24:00.814
I have to ask,
why do you need this scepter so badly?

24:00.897 --> 24:01.815
[roars]

24:02.607 --> 24:04.234
Good enough for me. [clears throat]

24:04.734 --> 24:07.571

we're down a couple of cater-waiters,

What? That's a terrible idea.
They're supposed to be laying low.

48:27.029 --> 48:28.322
We have to keep an eye on them.

anything else this weekend.

57:40.623 --> 57:41.666
Sure.

57:42.292 --> 57:44.752
Not a happy "Hallowedding" though.

57:49.299 --> 57:51.301
I'm surprised you even want to talk to me.

57:51.926 --> 57:54.762
I'm so, so sorry, guys.

57:55.430 --> 57:58.433
I just wanted to give you guys
an unforgettable party.

57:59.017 --> 58:01.352
Well, I promise you nobody will forget it.

58:01.936 --> 58:05.815
I mean, it was supposed to start
your whole marriage off on the right foot.

58:05.899 --> 58:09.277
-And now there can't even be a wedding.
-[Pop sighs]

58:09.360 --> 58:14.407
The thing is, Amy,
we love each other, and you, very much.

58:14.491 --> 58:16.409
So we're already on the right foot.

58:16.493 --> 58:18.411
A few mess-ups can't change that.

58:19.245 --> 58:21.456
That's true.

58:21.539 --> 58:25.668
When things went badly yesterday,
we could feel your heart break.

58:25.752 --> 58:29.172
You put the weight of the world
on your shoulders, and you didn't need to.

58:29.255 --> 58:34.719
Your happiness is more important to us
than a cocktail hour or a perfect wedding.

58:34.802 --> 58:39.599
Well, that's good because you can't have
a perfect wedding without rings.

58:40.225 --> 58:41.226
Says who?

58:41.309 --> 58:43.728
Not too long ago
we couldn't get married at all.

58:43.811 --> 58:46.147
Now we can get married any way we want.

58:46.231 --> 58:47.649
We don't need rings.

58:47.732 --> 58:49.901
We have each other, and we have you.

58:50.985 --> 58:54.614
Everything else is just gravy. [chuckles]

58:56.407 --> 58:57.700
Come here.

59:01.079 --> 59:02.705
[Pop sighs]

59:02.789 --> 59:04.666
Thanks, guys.

59:04.749 --> 59:07.252
I should probably get back to my friends.

59:07.335 --> 59:08.962
-Okay.
-Go.

59:11.673 --> 59:13.299
You think any of that got through?

59:13.383 --> 59:15.969
Probably not, but it will.

59:17.220 --> 59:18.513
That weird guy said,

59:18.596 --> 59:21.307
"She will now rest
side by side with Sobek,

59:21.391 --> 59:23.309
and they will be forever undisturbed."

59:23.393 --> 59:24.644
[Buzzy] Where would that be?

59:25.895 --> 59:26.896
No clue.

59:27.397 --> 59:31.067
Maybe someplace with Egyptian coffins
that aren't out in the open.

59:31.150 --> 59:33.528
Everybody knows
most museums keep their extra exhibits

59:33.611 --> 59:35.071
in a warehouse or something.

59:35.154 --> 59:36.573
They do for the one at home.

59:36.656 --> 59:38.825
Yeah, they totally do.

59:41.828 --> 59:43.329
[door opens]

59:43.413 --> 59:44.622
Hey.

59:47.292 --> 59:49.586
I heard you guys last night.

59:54.132 --> 59:58.511
I, uh-- I have to go do some stuff
in the other room.

59:58.595 --> 1:00:00.722
-Harold? You wanna join me?
-[grunts]

1:00:01.556 --> 1:00:02.557
[grunts]

1:00:03.266 --> 1:00:06.769
-[grunting]
-I'll explain later. Come on.

1:00:12.483 --> 1:00:15.445
Look, guys, I-I'm sorry.

1:00:16.070 --> 1:00:19.365
Yeah, I'm sorry I said what I said,
but I also meant it.

1:00:19.449 --> 1:00:22.577
I mean, you two kind of froze me out
like we were never even friends.

1:00:23.119 --> 1:00:25.580
Wow, Marshall. We had no idea.

1:00:25.663 --> 1:00:26.831
Yeah, I--

1:00:27.373 --> 1:00:29.125
Why didn't you say something to us?

1:00:29.208 --> 1:00:30.668
I didn't know how,

1:00:30.752 --> 1:00:33.171
and besides,
you two were always off at the paper

1:00:33.254 --> 1:00:36.007
or making videos
or just not hanging out with me.

1:00:39.510 --> 1:00:42.055
Anyways,
I just wanted to get that off my chest.

1:00:47.810 --> 1:00:49.228
You know what, Marshall?

1:00:50.021 --> 1:00:52.023
-You're right.
-I am?

1:00:52.106 --> 1:00:54.108
Yeah, we messed up.

1:00:54.192 --> 1:00:55.777
Yeah, I guess we got so excited

1:00:55.860 --> 1:00:58.279
about doing the Gutsy videos
for the school paper,

1:00:58.363 --> 1:01:00.823
we weren't really thinking
about anything else.

1:01:00.907 --> 1:01:03.326
Yeah, and we didn't mean
to make you feel bad,

1:01:03.910 --> 1:01:05.119
but now we know we did.

1:01:05.203 --> 1:01:07.705
And I'm really sorry.

1:01:08.956 --> 1:01:11.542
Yeah. Sorry, Marsh.

1:01:13.586 --> 1:01:16.089
[sighs] Apology accepted.

1:01:19.300 --> 1:01:21.219
-All right!
-[grunting]

1:01:22.053 --> 1:01:23.763
Not that we were eavesdropping
or anything.

1:01:23.846 --> 1:01:26.516
Okay, let's bring Amy up to speed
on what we figured out.

1:01:26.599 --> 1:01:28.935
Okay. Gilbert thinks Sobek took Rose

1:01:29.018 --> 1:01:31.521
someplace where they can be
in side-by-side coffins undisturbed.

1:01:31.604 --> 1:01:34.232
And Marshall thinks we should be looking
for a museum warehouse

1:01:34.315 --> 1:01:36.317
-or something like that.
-[Amy] Mmm.

1:01:36.859 --> 1:01:40.947
Yes. I did a story on the Rockport Museum
storage facility a few years ago.

1:01:41.030 --> 1:01:44.951
It's a warehouse with a huge Egyptian
collection about a half hour from here.

1:01:45.451 --> 1:01:47.370
Nice work, you two. You make a good team.

1:01:49.956 --> 1:01:51.290
You all do.

1:01:52.625 --> 1:01:53.876
[grunts]

1:01:53.960 --> 1:01:56.003
It's noon now,
and the wedding starts at 5:00.

1:01:56.087 --> 1:02:00.675
All we have to do between then and now
is defeat a super-powerful evil mummy,

1:02:01.259 --> 1:02:03.094
who's got a laser scepter.

1:02:03.720 --> 1:02:06.013
-Piece of cake.
-[Amy] Come on. Let's go.

1:02:12.395 --> 1:02:14.772
O great and powerful Sobek,

1:02:15.356 --> 1:02:18.192
though it took many hours
and possibly years off my life,

1:02:18.276 --> 1:02:22.321
I am pleased to announce
that your tomb is complete.

1:02:22.405 --> 1:02:23.531
[groans]

1:02:23.614 --> 1:02:27.827
This is where you and your love shall rest
for eternity,

1:02:27.910 --> 1:02:31.914
-side by side, as the gods intended.
-[groans]

1:02:31.998 --> 1:02:34.500
A blessed couple such as yourselves will,
of course,

1:02:34.584 --> 1:02:37.003
need round-the-clock protection.

1:02:37.086 --> 1:02:40.214
Which is why I included two guards
to watch over you.

1:02:40.298 --> 1:02:41.424
And finally,

1:02:42.008 --> 1:02:45.511
your coffins and accoutrements
are in this crate,

1:02:45.595 --> 1:02:47.180
which I will seal around you.

1:02:47.263 --> 1:02:51.100
And then you will be hidden forever,
never to be found.

1:02:51.184 --> 1:02:54.604
-At least I hope not. For my sake.
-[growls]

1:02:55.396 --> 1:02:57.690
Does His Awesomeness approve?

1:02:58.524 --> 1:02:59.525
[growls]

1:02:59.609 --> 1:03:02.028
He loves it. Yes! [chuckles]

1:03:02.612 --> 1:03:03.613
Okay.

1:03:12.079 --> 1:03:13.915
-[Harold grunting]
-[Amy] This way. Shh! Shh!

1:03:20.463 --> 1:03:22.924
[intern]
But that's why I put him next to her.

1:03:23.007 --> 1:03:24.008
I hear voices.

1:03:24.091 --> 1:03:25.968
[intern] …every week. I'll come in.
I'll bring tacos.

1:03:26.052 --> 1:03:28.221
I think it's coming from over there.
Come on.

1:03:28.304 --> 1:03:29.722
[intern] Chicken nuggets. I don't--

1:03:29.806 --> 1:03:32.099
You haven't tried those things.
That's gonna be amazing.

1:03:32.183 --> 1:03:33.976
Uh, you're gonna be sealed away forever,

1:03:34.060 --> 1:03:38.105
and what is a better send-off
than the world's freshest fruit?

1:03:38.189 --> 1:03:39.524
-Rose's amulet.
-[intern] You know what they say,

1:03:39.607 --> 1:03:41.692
"An apple a day keeps the doctor away."

1:03:41.776 --> 1:03:43.945
Even when you're dead. [laughs]

1:03:44.028 --> 1:03:47.031
-[grunts]
-Don't worry, big guy. We'll get her back.

1:03:47.114 --> 1:03:49.283
[intern] Can't stress how many hours
I put into this.

1:03:49.367 --> 1:03:50.493
What's the plan?

1:03:50.576 --> 1:03:52.662
Okay, we need to get Sobek's doofy guy
out of the way.

1:03:52.745 --> 1:03:55.623
That should be pretty easy.
And once we do that, we can revive Rose.

1:03:55.706 --> 1:03:57.250
What's Sobek doing while we're doing that?

1:03:57.333 --> 1:03:59.544
-Because he's right there.
-Good point.

1:03:59.627 --> 1:04:02.672
We'll grab the amulet.
Then one of us can distract Sobek.

1:04:02.755 --> 1:04:04.465
While that's happening, we'll revive Rose.

1:04:04.549 --> 1:04:05.883
Great. Couldn't be easier.

1:04:05.967 --> 1:04:07.426
And after we do all of that,

1:04:07.510 --> 1:04:08.678
Harold, you think you and Rose

1:04:08.761 --> 1:04:10.263
-can take down Sobek?
-[grunts]

1:04:10.346 --> 1:04:11.639
-I'm good with this.
-Yeah, me too.

1:04:11.722 --> 1:04:12.974
-Yeah.
-[grunts]

1:04:13.057 --> 1:04:19.397
Uh, I don't know. Sobek's really big
and strong and powerful. And…

1:04:19.480 --> 1:04:21.190
Gil, you okay?

1:04:21.274 --> 1:04:22.358
Yeah, I'm just…

1:04:23.442 --> 1:04:25.778
[sighs] I'm fine.

1:04:29.323 --> 1:04:31.242
Guys. I think I have an idea.

1:04:33.369 --> 1:04:34.662
[Amy] Shh!

1:04:39.667 --> 1:04:40.668
Ow!

1:04:43.337 --> 1:04:44.505
Wh--

1:04:45.756 --> 1:04:47.008
I-Is someone there?

1:04:47.091 --> 1:04:48.092
[grunts]

1:04:50.094 --> 1:04:53.431
Okay. You can't hide from--

1:04:53.514 --> 1:04:56.183
Ah, well, that was easy.

1:04:56.267 --> 1:04:57.518
[shouts]

1:04:57.602 --> 1:04:59.020
What the-- You gotta--

1:04:59.103 --> 1:05:00.396
-[Harold growls]
-[intern screams]

1:05:01.647 --> 1:05:03.274
-[strains]
-It's not your color.

1:05:06.944 --> 1:05:08.362
[strains]

1:05:08.446 --> 1:05:11.073
-[sighs] All right, guys, let's head in.
-[Amy] Okay.

1:05:11.157 --> 1:05:12.199
[Buzzy] Let's go.

1:05:13.826 --> 1:05:15.036
[muffled grunting]

1:05:17.371 --> 1:05:18.623
[Sobek groans]

1:05:19.999 --> 1:05:23.044
Okay, which one of us
is going to distract Sobek?

1:05:23.127 --> 1:05:24.545
[straining]

1:05:26.631 --> 1:05:29.050
Okay, well,
don't everybody volunteer at once.

1:05:29.133 --> 1:05:31.719
Sobek. Help!

1:05:31.802 --> 1:05:34.180
Well, that guy volunteered, I guess.

1:05:34.263 --> 1:05:35.640
-[roars]
-[children gasp]

1:05:35.723 --> 1:05:39.185
[intern] These ropes are cutting off
my circulation!

1:05:39.268 --> 1:05:42.438
Okay. We only have a second
till Sobek gets back. Let's go get Rose.

1:05:42.521 --> 1:05:46.359
[intern] I need your mighty strength
to assist me, Sobek!

1:05:46.984 --> 1:05:49.528
Hey. Sobek.
I have this mostly under control,

1:05:49.612 --> 1:05:51.948
but if you could untie these ropes,
that would be amazing.

1:05:52.031 --> 1:05:52.990
[gasps]

1:05:55.076 --> 1:05:56.118
[Harold grunting]

1:05:56.202 --> 1:05:57.453
[Buzzy whispers] There we go.

1:05:59.914 --> 1:06:00.873
[gasps]

1:06:01.457 --> 1:06:04.001
[Buzzy] Hey. It's okay. It's okay.
You're safe.

1:06:04.085 --> 1:06:05.419
-[Rose panting]
-[Harold grunting]

1:06:05.503 --> 1:06:06.879
It's okay. It's just us.

1:06:06.963 --> 1:06:11.175
Intruder alert. Your sworn enemy
and those rotten kids are here! [groans]

1:06:11.258 --> 1:06:12.760
[growls]

1:06:13.427 --> 1:06:14.929
[Amy] Guys, come on. We gotta go.

1:06:15.554 --> 1:06:16.973
[Sobek growls]

1:06:17.056 --> 1:06:17.974
[all gasp]

1:06:20.309 --> 1:06:21.477
[Marshall] Whoa! Okay, okay.

1:06:21.560 --> 1:06:22.812
Listen, Mr. Sobek,

1:06:22.895 --> 1:06:25.356
if you can just let us go,
we won't tell anyone.

1:06:25.439 --> 1:06:26.941
-No one needs to know.
-[roars]

1:06:27.024 --> 1:06:28.025
[children scream]

1:06:31.445 --> 1:06:35.116
Ladies and gentlemen,
meet the members of Sobek's court.

1:06:38.327 --> 1:06:39.370
[guards growling]

1:06:39.453 --> 1:06:40.955
-[Marshall] Oh, no.
-[Buzzy gasps]

1:06:41.038 --> 1:06:43.207
-[Marshall] Oh, no, no, no.
-[Gilbert screams]

1:06:44.834 --> 1:06:46.127
[grunts]

1:06:46.210 --> 1:06:50.673
Bring Sobek's beloved to us.
Bring the rest of them to their doom.

1:06:50.756 --> 1:06:53.175
-[Harold, Rose grunting]
-[guards roaring]

1:06:53.259 --> 1:06:55.720
[children screaming]

1:06:55.803 --> 1:06:57.930
[grunting]

1:07:03.352 --> 1:07:04.478
Watch out!

1:07:23.456 --> 1:07:24.457
[groans]

1:07:25.916 --> 1:07:27.918
-Harold!
-[grunting, panting]

1:07:28.002 --> 1:07:29.170
-[Harold groans]
-[growls]

1:07:31.630 --> 1:07:33.591
-[growls]
-[groans]

1:07:33.674 --> 1:07:35.259
Go get those brats.

1:07:36.135 --> 1:07:37.720
[Amy] Guys, we gotta get out of here.

1:07:37.803 --> 1:07:39.805
[Marshall] Come on. Go, go, go, go, go!

1:07:42.516 --> 1:07:44.101
No. No. Stay back.

1:07:44.185 --> 1:07:45.936
[roars]

1:07:46.020 --> 1:07:47.772
-Dead end!
-Oh, no. We've been corn-mazed!

1:07:47.855 --> 1:07:50.608
-Help! Get away from me!
-[groans]

1:07:50.691 --> 1:07:52.610
-Where's Gilbert?
-[Marshall] Oh, no.

1:07:56.155 --> 1:07:58.240
Come on, Gilbert. Stay gutsy. Stay gutsy.

1:07:58.324 --> 1:08:00.159
-[growls]
-[Gilbert] Whoa! [yelps]

1:08:00.826 --> 1:08:02.078
[screams]

1:08:03.037 --> 1:08:05.206
-[Amy] Gilbert!
-What are you doing?

1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:09.043
[Amy] Get down.

1:08:10.544 --> 1:08:11.796
[grunting]

1:08:13.464 --> 1:08:14.965
-No. No.
-No, Rose.

1:08:15.925 --> 1:08:17.134
[Sobek grunts]

1:08:17.927 --> 1:08:19.136
-Bring her to us.

You were his best friend.
And what did you do?

what you are putting down.

And he has decided if he cannot have you,
his true love,

1:11:28.951 --> 1:11:31.620
I mean, he was. He was a monster.

1:11:31.704 --> 1:11:34.498
But before all of that,
the three of them were friends.

1:11:34.581 --> 1:11:37.042
And he was Harold's best friend.

1:11:38.168 --> 1:11:40.963
Well, I'm glad that's never gonna happen
to the three of us.

1:11:42.673 --> 1:11:46.010
Agreed. I think we're gonna be okay.

1:11:46.677 --> 1:11:47.886

I mean, what are you talking about?
You were amazing up there.

1:12:03.861 --> 1:12:05.571
-[Amy] Yeah.
-I was scared.

1:12:05.654 --> 1:12:07.323
I was scared the whole time.

1:12:09.408 --> 1:12:12.953

1:13:14.431 --> 1:13:15.849
Oh. These?

1:13:17.434 --> 1:13:22.815
Um, I know you guys probably didn't have
wedding ceremonies in ancient Egypt,

1:13:22.898 --> 1:13:25.359
but this is a part of ours.

1:13:25.442 --> 1:13:30.864
These rings are something we use
as a symbol of our love and connection.

1:13:30.948 --> 1:13:33.450
And people exchange them

1:13:33.534 --> 1:13:39.415
to show that they are giving their love
from the heart to the other.

1:13:40.416 --> 1:13:41.667
[grunting]

1:13:43.710 --> 1:13:45.421
[Amy] Yeah, that's right.

1:13:46.004 --> 1:13:49.007
Exchanging them is
like giving the other person

1:13:49.091 --> 1:13:52.594
a little piece of you
to carry around with them at all times.

1:13:55.848 --> 1:13:58.016
Yeah. You get it.

Yeah, he is a little whiffy.

1:14:36.930 --> 1:14:39.183
Buzzy, can you run into my dads' room
and grab something for him?

1:14:39.266 --> 1:14:40.726
-Yes. Come on.
-[Amy] Okay. Let's go.

1:14:40.809 --> 1:14:42.853
-[Marshall] Go, go, go.
-Go, go, go, go, go.

1:14:48.817 --> 1:14:51.862
[Buzzy] All right,
we got here with ten minutes to spare.

1:14:53.864 --> 1:14:55.157
Dearly beloved,

1:14:55.240 --> 1:14:59.161
we are gathered here today to celebrate
the union of Michael and Carl.

1:14:59.661 --> 1:15:03.373
Now, some of you might be wondering,
"A wedding on Halloween?"

1:15:03.457 --> 1:15:05.000
-[Harold grunts]
-[minister] But when you think about it,

1:15:05.083 --> 1:15:05.918
it makes sense.

1:15:06.001 --> 1:15:09.630
Michael and Carl, as it turns out,
first met on Halloween two years ago.

1:15:09.713 --> 1:15:12.799
They discovered
they shared a love of old horror movies,

1:15:12.883 --> 1:15:15.636
and then they discovered
they shared a love of so much more.

1:15:15.719 --> 1:15:18.639
I don't have to tell you
the love they shared was for each other.

1:15:18.722 --> 1:15:20.849
Now, normally,
this is where we exchange the rings,

1:15:20.933 --> 1:15:23.644
-but our couple have chosen to forgo--
-Um…

1:15:23.727 --> 1:15:24.895
Actually…

1:15:25.896 --> 1:15:30.776
we can still forgo it,
but I do happen to have them.

1:15:32.194 --> 1:15:34.404
You're full of surprises, aren't you?

1:15:34.488 --> 1:15:36.198
I'm done after this, I promise.

1:15:37.324 --> 1:15:39.284
I know we could have done this
without the rings.

1:15:39.368 --> 1:15:41.453
And it would have been just as amazing.

1:15:41.995 --> 1:15:45.499
Because you have each other,
and we have each other.

1:15:46.542 --> 1:15:48.210
Everything else is just gravy.

1:15:50.170 --> 1:15:54.174
[minister] All right. Now that we have the
rings, we can commence with the exchange

1:15:54.258 --> 1:15:57.803
and finalize
the union between Michael and Carl.

1:15:59.972 --> 1:16:02.266
-Of course.
-[minister] Carl, repeat after me?

1:16:02.349 --> 1:16:05.978
-"I, Carl Ramone"…
-Anything for a friend.

1:16:06.061 --> 1:16:07.688
I, Carl Ramone…

1:16:07.771 --> 1:16:10.315

Michael Vann"…

Michael Vann…

1:16:14.236 --> 1:16:16.989

husband, forever and ever."

[Carl] …as my lawfully wedded husband,
forever and ever.

1:16:38.260 --> 1:16:41.138
[minister] And now, Michael.
"I, Michael Vann"…

1:16:41.638 --> 1:16:43.390
I, Michael Vann…

1:16:43.473 --> 1:16:46.226
…"do solemnly swear to take this man,

husband, forever and ever."

1:16:53.108 --> 1:16:57.029
[Pop] …as my lawfully wedded husband,
forever and ever.
