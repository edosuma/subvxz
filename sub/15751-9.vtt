10:39.550 --> 10:41.670
-Tammy and I agree on one thing.

10:41.670 --> 10:42.370
Well--

10:42.370 --> 10:43.660
-Not couches.

10:43.660 --> 10:44.360
-We agree on--

10:44.360 --> 10:45.060
-But tits.

10:45.060 --> 10:46.070
-Two things.

10:46.070 --> 10:46.900
-Which was the other one?

10:46.900 --> 10:47.770
-Both of your tits.

10:47.770 --> 10:52.060
[LAUGHTER]

10:53.020 --> 10:54.010
-I should get the office.

10:54.010 --> 10:55.560
I should get the assistant.

10:55.560 --> 10:57.120
None of that really matters.

10:57.120 --> 10:59.470
Because the one thing that
matters is being the first one

10:59.470 --> 11:00.970
to find that band
that's untouched

11:00.970 --> 11:03.650
and then when you find them,
just like having that instinct

11:03.650 --> 11:06.650
to know, this is the sound
that's going to break through.

11:06.650 --> 11:08.830
That's all that matters.

11:08.830 --> 11:10.940
-See, I think I'm,
like, the literally

11:10.940 --> 11:12.120
exact opposite of you.

11:12.120 --> 11:14.660
I just try to take
really, really,

11:14.660 --> 11:19.100
really old shit that people
have heard a million times,

11:19.100 --> 11:24.260
and then I try to make
it sound new again.

11:24.260 --> 11:24.960
-Hey.

11:24.960 --> 11:25.890
I left my sweater
in the bathroom.

11:25.890 --> 11:26.740
-Raquel, Bianca.

11:26.740 --> 11:27.910
Bianca, Raquel.

11:27.910 --> 11:28.740
-Hey.

11:28.740 --> 11:29.540
-Hi.

11:29.540 --> 11:30.390
-What's up?

11:30.390 --> 11:32.140
-What's up?

11:32.140 --> 11:33.740
-Oh, you're wearing
that shirt I like.

11:33.740 --> 11:34.440
-Bye.

11:34.440 --> 11:36.320
Later.

11:36.320 --> 11:37.610
-What is that?

11:37.610 --> 11:39.440
-She is, uh, crashing here.

11:39.440 --> 11:40.140
-Later.

11:40.140 --> 11:40.950
-Bye.

11:40.950 --> 11:46.550
-She's my sister's new
girlfriend's ex's stepdaughter.

11:46.550 --> 11:47.370
-Yeah.

11:47.370 --> 11:48.070
-Stepdaughter.

11:48.070 --> 11:48.460
Yeah.

11:48.460 --> 11:49.760
-You can take a
second, if you need to,

11:49.760 --> 11:52.210
and get your story straight.

11:52.210 --> 11:54.190
-Um, there's no story.

11:54.190 --> 11:55.810
-She's living here?

11:55.810 --> 11:57.450
-She is just crashing here.

11:57.450 --> 11:58.180
It is temporary.

11:58.180 --> 11:59.610
-She's living here.

11:59.610 --> 12:00.900
-No, she's crashing here.

12:00.900 --> 12:01.630
-OK.

12:01.630 --> 12:02.400
-She's was a kid that--

12:02.400 --> 12:04.270
-I don't know how to play games.

12:04.270 --> 12:05.650
-I'm not playing.
-I really don't want to.

12:05.650 --> 12:06.350
I'm just.

12:06.350 --> 12:08.290
-Hey, I'm not playing games.

12:08.290 --> 12:10.860
-I think I just-- I
think I need to go, Josh.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.250
If you don't mind.

12:12.250 --> 12:14.190
-Can we calm down for a second?

12:14.190 --> 12:15.370
-I am calm.

12:15.370 --> 12:16.130
-Clearly.

12:16.130 --> 12:18.890
-This is just a
waste of my time.

12:18.890 --> 12:19.840
-I'm wasting your time?

12:19.840 --> 12:20.540
-Yes.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.060
-What, spending
time with somebody

12:22.060 --> 12:23.500
that you actually like?

12:23.500 --> 12:24.450
-Oh.

12:24.450 --> 12:27.260
-You like me, right?

12:27.260 --> 12:28.160
-Yeah.

12:28.160 --> 12:29.090
-OK.

12:29.090 --> 12:30.180
That's good.

12:30.180 --> 12:32.390
So can we not be in a rush?

12:32.390 --> 12:34.290
Like why are we in a hurry.

12:34.290 --> 12:35.410
-I'm not in a hurry.

12:35.410 --> 12:38.500
-You brought up your
eggs on the first date.

12:38.500 --> 12:41.170
-You're going to seriously
throw that back in my face?

12:41.170 --> 12:44.510
I was trying to make
a joke about my eggs.

12:44.510 --> 12:47.070
I'm not ashamed that
I want a family, Josh.

12:47.070 --> 12:48.700
Sorry that is so
terrifying to you.

12:48.700 --> 12:50.890
I could have been kicked
out of the temple.

12:50.890 --> 12:51.640
-For what?

12:51.640 --> 12:53.610
-For fucking a congregant, Josh.

12:53.610 --> 12:56.120
-I'm not a congregant.

12:56.120 --> 12:57.060
-I put you on lists.

12:57.060 --> 12:58.560
I added you to my email blasts.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.180
-Yeah, I'll unsubscribe.

13:00.180 --> 13:00.900
I don't care.

13:00.900 --> 13:02.880
-That is really gentlemanly.

13:02.880 --> 13:03.950
-I don't give a fuck about that.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.680
-And we never fucked
anyway, did we?

13:05.680 --> 13:06.690
-No, we didn't fuck.

13:06.690 --> 13:07.670
-No, we--

13:13.060 --> 13:17.470
[MOANING]

13:17.470 --> 13:18.940
-I want to come in you.

13:18.940 --> 13:22.370
Can I come in you?

13:22.370 --> 13:23.370
-Yes.

13:23.370 --> 13:25.460
Yes, come inside me.

13:25.460 --> 13:29.000
[MOANING]

13:35.270 --> 13:37.740
-Was that OK?

13:37.740 --> 13:39.720
-Oh my God.

13:39.720 --> 13:41.000
-Sorry.

13:41.000 --> 13:41.700
OK?

13:46.650 --> 13:48.460
-Oh my God, are you
fucking my brother?

13:54.380 --> 13:55.850
Oh my God.

13:55.850 --> 13:56.640
-Do you care?

13:56.640 --> 13:57.340
I mean--

13:57.340 --> 13:58.310
-Yes, I care.

13:58.310 --> 14:00.210
Doesn't it occur to you
that this might make

14:00.210 --> 14:04.500
me feel strange or bad or weird?

14:04.500 --> 14:06.900
-You make me feel
bad all the time.

14:06.900 --> 14:07.880
Like all the time.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.430
Like remember when
you were in college

14:09.430 --> 14:11.980
and you're like, come visit me,
and I drove all the way there

14:11.980 --> 14:13.420
and then I just hung
out with your roommate

14:13.420 --> 14:15.290
while you like fucked
some guy in the back room.

14:15.290 --> 14:17.540
-You're talking about stuff that
happened literally decades ago.

14:17.540 --> 14:19.520
-And like I'm buying
you drugs, and you're

14:19.520 --> 14:21.070
like, "OK, thanks for the drugs.

14:21.070 --> 14:22.880
Now I'm going to do
them with someone else."

14:22.880 --> 14:24.990
Or you just leave me in
like butt fuck nowhere

14:24.990 --> 14:27.270
with some trans man and then
I'm like dressing you up.

14:27.270 --> 14:28.470
-I don't know why
you're acting like

14:28.470 --> 14:30.640
a fucking jealous girlfriend.

14:30.640 --> 14:34.900
And what any of that
stuff has to do with this.

14:34.900 --> 14:37.240
-I feel terrible constantly.

14:37.240 --> 14:38.470
Constantly.

14:38.470 --> 14:40.310
I just don't even exist in this.

14:40.310 --> 14:41.920
Like you're not listening to me.

14:41.920 --> 14:43.210
I don't understand.

14:43.210 --> 14:45.350
Stop yelling at me
and making me feel--

14:45.350 --> 14:46.400
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14:46.400 --> 14:47.190
-Bad about this.

14:47.190 --> 14:47.890
It's like--

14:50.540 --> 14:54.170
-What do you mean you
feel terrible constantly?

14:54.170 --> 14:56.490
I'm constantly hurting you?

14:59.350 --> 15:00.900
-It's just hard.

15:00.900 --> 15:08.770
Um, I feel like since, um, like
since eighth grade, I just,

15:08.770 --> 15:16.700
I've had, um, feelings
for you, like, um, uh,

15:16.700 --> 15:20.110
that are confusing,
that aren't just

15:20.110 --> 15:22.860
like friend-- friend
feelings, like they're

15:22.860 --> 15:24.200
more than friend feelings.

15:24.200 --> 15:27.120
And um, it's just, I
don't know, it just

15:27.120 --> 15:32.320
seems weird that you've
never noticed those before.

15:32.320 --> 15:35.500
-I'm just confused.

15:35.500 --> 15:41.350
If this is how
you feel, then why

15:41.350 --> 15:44.910
are you sleeping
with my brother?

15:44.910 --> 15:47.210
-But if you're
feeling possessive,

15:47.210 --> 15:50.340
doesn't that mean you might
feel the same way towards me?

16:16.090 --> 16:16.790
[EXHALES]

16:16.790 --> 16:17.490
-OK.

16:24.350 --> 16:26.780
-You do this in front
of other people?

16:26.780 --> 16:27.480
-Yeah.

16:27.480 --> 16:28.360
Everyone just does it.

16:28.360 --> 16:30.880
It's just a--

-Oh, fuck.

16:45.290 --> 16:47.990
-And how long has it been you?

16:47.990 --> 16:51.300
Was it you when we met?

16:51.300 --> 16:54.330
Was it you on our wedding night?

16:54.330 --> 16:55.030
-Yes.

17:00.660 --> 17:02.700
-I can't.

17:02.700 --> 17:03.400
I'm done.

17:07.330 --> 17:08.440
-All right.

17:08.440 --> 17:10.180
They have arrived.

17:10.180 --> 17:12.250
Look at that burnt
orange colour.

17:12.250 --> 17:13.720
Isn't that gorgeous?

17:13.720 --> 17:15.370
-It's a little '70s, isn't it?

17:15.370 --> 17:16.480
-No, because, I
mean, the colour,

17:16.480 --> 17:17.790
the orange with
the blue, you know?

17:17.790 --> 17:18.490
-Yeah.

17:18.490 --> 17:19.030
-You OK?

17:19.030 --> 17:20.350
You like it?
-Yeah, it's cool.

17:20.350 --> 17:20.630
-Really?

-Yeah.

about Barb and Len?

-Yeah, of course.

17:32.330 --> 17:33.120
Of course I do.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.980
-Do you think, like,
about what we did to them?

17:34.980 --> 17:36.280
Do you think that's OK?

17:36.280 --> 17:40.000
-You know, it's just, uh,
they're on their own path,

dating this Melanie chick.

-Seriously?

17:48.150 --> 17:48.980
-You know.

-Like how cliche can you get?

17:50.510 --> 17:53.460
And she has this disabled
son, so basically he's

17:53.460 --> 17:55.890
going to spend like the rest
of his life going on slow walks

17:55.890 --> 17:57.280
and washing mittens.

17:57.280 --> 17:58.790
-That might be what--
what Len needs.

17:58.790 --> 18:00.430
-That's just going to
take him away from us,

18:00.430 --> 18:02.310
and-- I mean, from the kids.

a little bit jealous, babe.

really what you're doing.

more like you're jealous,

And I know a little something
about being jealous,

me you could sing.

to say goodbye.

-Nothing.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.940
I don't want to talk about it.

19:08.940 --> 19:10.170
The thing is, if he
was already dead,

19:10.170 --> 19:11.410
like, there wouldn't
be ambulances.

19:11.410 --> 19:12.980
There'd be like a coroner
and a bunch of people

from the temple.

-Didn't Ed have any
family of his own?

19:16.310 --> 19:18.120
-Well, if I remember
correctly, his lack

19:18.120 --> 19:20.330
of family was a
strong selling point/

19:20.330 --> 19:21.030
-So everything's--

a lot of medicine.

19:24.860 --> 19:26.370
-Is he gone?

19:26.370 --> 19:27.650
-Not yet.

19:27.650 --> 19:28.810
-Where is he?

19:28.810 --> 19:30.430
-In the bedroom.

19:30.430 --> 19:32.330
-Moppa, what are you doing here?

19:32.330 --> 19:33.410
-Hi, kids.

19:33.410 --> 19:34.730
We made Arnold Palmers.

19:34.730 --> 19:36.860
Come on in.

19:36.860 --> 19:38.810
It might be a little
sweet, so tell me

19:38.810 --> 19:40.590
and I'll just adjust the ratio.

19:40.590 --> 19:41.760
-Dad, what are you
doing over here?

19:41.760 --> 19:43.460
-Do you want one?

19:43.460 --> 19:44.160
-Yeah.

19:44.160 --> 19:44.860
-It's perfect.

20:02.460 --> 20:03.960
-How you doing?

20:11.410 --> 20:12.410
You look good.

20:17.870 --> 20:20.140
-So you guys have
been hanging out?

20:20.140 --> 20:21.010
-A little bit.

20:21.010 --> 20:22.410
-Yeah, what are you doing here?

20:22.410 --> 20:25.860
-Oh, I just came over because
I was feeling kind of down.

20:25.860 --> 20:31.020
Seems my kids abandoned me at a
critical moment in my journey.

20:31.020 --> 20:32.370
So I felt kind of
down and I thought

20:32.370 --> 20:35.230
I would visit your
mum whom I trust.

20:35.230 --> 20:37.740
I was up there on
stage and I was,

20:37.740 --> 20:40.450
I believe, trying to do my best.

20:40.450 --> 20:41.230
-We were there.

20:41.230 --> 20:42.040
-We were there.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.010
-We were there.

20:43.010 --> 20:43.780
-You weren't there.

20:43.780 --> 20:44.710
That row was--

20:44.710 --> 20:48.290
-It was just at the very last--
I mean, you were amazing.

20:48.290 --> 20:49.070
You were great.

20:49.070 --> 20:51.470
-No, really, it was really,
really, really good.

20:51.470 --> 20:52.270
-Those wigs.

20:52.270 --> 20:52.970
-We--

20:52.970 --> 20:53.670
-And your makeup.

20:53.670 --> 20:54.610
-We rented those.

20:54.610 --> 20:56.270
-And you looked stunning.

20:56.270 --> 20:57.590
And your eyelashes.

20:57.590 --> 20:58.640
-On, those were double lashes.

20:58.640 --> 20:59.340
-Oh my God.

20:59.340 --> 21:02.080
-Can we get on with it, honey?

21:02.080 --> 21:05.540
-Ed is, uh, in a dire state, and
we've been talking about this.

21:05.540 --> 21:06.240
-And I'm done.

21:06.240 --> 21:07.210
That's all there is to it.

21:07.210 --> 21:07.910
-Your mum is done.

21:07.910 --> 21:09.680
-Done with what?

21:09.680 --> 21:11.960
-Well, and that's why we
invited you over here,

21:11.960 --> 21:13.930
so that you could have
a chance to say goodbye.

21:13.930 --> 21:14.830
-Wait, what does that mean?

21:14.830 --> 21:16.400
Is he about to die?

21:16.400 --> 21:20.250
-Well, not now but maybe
sooner than we thought.

21:20.250 --> 21:21.720
-He's in a lot of pain.

21:21.720 --> 21:27.590
We're going to ease Ed
into the next transition.

21:27.590 --> 21:28.290
-He's fine.

21:28.290 --> 21:29.750
He's exactly the same as always.

21:29.750 --> 21:30.720
I was just in there with him.

21:30.720 --> 21:31.580
He was smiling at me.

21:31.580 --> 21:33.630
-He smiles, be blinked,
he pisses, he shits.

21:33.630 --> 21:36.360
You don't have any idea
what his life is like.

21:36.360 --> 21:38.300
-I'm sorry, are you talking
about his life or your life?

21:38.300 --> 21:40.590
Because if you're
done, that's fine.

21:40.590 --> 21:42.950
But I don't think you get
to decide when his is over.

21:42.950 --> 21:45.890
-And your mum, your anxiety
is through the roof.

21:45.890 --> 21:49.020
To get one of you three to even
notice what's going on here

21:49.020 --> 21:50.190
is almost impossible.

21:50.190 --> 21:50.890
-We notice.

21:50.890 --> 21:52.050
-You don't notice, sweetie.

21:52.050 --> 21:52.750
-I do.

21:52.750 --> 21:54.620
I call her all the time.

21:54.620 --> 21:56.990
Do I not?

21:56.990 --> 21:58.480
-I don't want you to call me.

22:01.710 --> 22:03.100
I want you to be here.

22:08.680 --> 22:10.970
He's the one who comes.

22:10.970 --> 22:11.670
-She.

22:11.670 --> 22:13.310
-No one else.

22:13.310 --> 22:14.180
Not one of you.

22:14.180 --> 22:14.950
-I come over.

22:14.950 --> 22:18.440
-I am cleaning the piss
and the shit and the vomit

22:18.440 --> 22:21.210
and I sit here alone with him
in front of the television

22:21.210 --> 22:22.570
and I have nobody to talk to.

22:22.570 --> 22:23.430
-We're here.

22:23.430 --> 22:25.630
-Yeah, but your
minds are elsewhere.

22:25.630 --> 22:27.570
He came over to be with me.

22:27.570 --> 22:28.270
-She.

22:28.270 --> 22:29.930
I'm-- I'm a she.

22:29.930 --> 22:32.280
I'm a woman.

22:32.280 --> 22:32.980
-I think--

22:32.980 --> 22:36.770
-She takes care of me.

22:36.770 --> 22:38.180
-We--

22:38.180 --> 22:41.080
-I can't anymore.

22:41.080 --> 22:44.220
I can't.

22:44.220 --> 22:45.270
Look at me.

22:45.270 --> 22:47.220
Look at me.

22:47.220 --> 22:49.650
It's either him or me.

22:49.650 --> 22:51.660
-I think we should get
the rabbi over here.

22:51.660 --> 22:54.190
I feel like we need
some outside help.

22:54.190 --> 22:55.530
-What do we need the rabbi for?

22:55.530 --> 22:56.810
-It's a big decision.

22:56.810 --> 22:58.310
-What, we're like
religious Jews?

22:58.310 --> 23:00.130
-I'm going to text
her right now.

23:00.130 --> 23:02.450
-Why do you have
the rabbi's number?

23:02.450 --> 23:04.550
-We've been hanging out.

23:04.550 --> 23:05.800
We're hanging out.

23:05.800 --> 23:06.650
-Oh my God.

23:06.650 --> 23:07.510
-Oh my God--

23:07.510 --> 23:09.010
-Oh my God, are you
fucking the rabbi?

23:09.010 --> 23:11.360
-You're fucking the rabbi.

23:11.360 --> 23:12.420
-You're fucking the rabbi.

23:12.420 --> 23:13.910
-You're fucking the rabbi?

23:13.910 --> 23:16.420
-Mum, mommy, this is different.

23:16.420 --> 23:18.390
-Ma!

23:18.390 --> 23:20.260
I love her for him.

23:20.260 --> 23:20.960
-I do too.

23:20.960 --> 23:24.320
But wait, I want to go on record
that I was the one who first

23:24.320 --> 23:25.950
said that I thought she
was fabulous for him.

23:25.950 --> 23:26.650
Right?

23:26.650 --> 23:27.980
-But I called it.

23:27.980 --> 23:29.270
-I've never felt
like this before.

23:29.270 --> 23:31.260
-Oh my God, I have
to get out of here.

23:31.260 --> 23:33.180
-Oh my God.

23:33.180 --> 23:34.140
Like goosebumps.

23:37.500 --> 23:39.670
-Als, what's the deal?

23:39.670 --> 23:41.130
-Can you just leave
me alone, please?

23:41.130 --> 23:41.830
-No.

23:41.830 --> 23:43.020
It's like totally
insane in there.

23:43.020 --> 23:45.120
I think we should all
be there together.

23:45.120 --> 23:46.810
-Well, I'm not
helping do it, so.

23:46.810 --> 23:48.060
-We're just helping
by listening.

23:48.060 --> 23:51.080
-No, you're helping by helping.

23:51.080 --> 23:51.780
-OK, you know what?

23:51.780 --> 23:54.290
Everyone can't
bail all the time.

23:54.290 --> 23:55.230
That's great.

23:58.550 --> 23:59.260
OK, you know what?

23:59.260 --> 24:01.180
I'll just deal with it.

24:01.180 --> 24:03.130
-Yeah, go take care of it.

24:03.130 --> 24:04.500
Go take care of killing Ed.

24:04.500 --> 24:05.540
-Oh yeah, no, you relax.

24:05.540 --> 24:06.240
You relax.

24:06.240 --> 24:08.420
You stay here and take care
of yourself, Als, as usual.

24:13.820 --> 24:16.110
-Why are you being an asshole?

24:16.110 --> 24:16.920
What's going on?

24:20.220 --> 24:22.750
-Um, I don't know,
maybe something

24:22.750 --> 24:27.390
like you've been fucking
Syd and didn't think

24:27.390 --> 24:31.280
it was necessary to
tell me about that.

24:31.280 --> 24:32.020
-That.

24:32.020 --> 24:33.000
-Yeah, that.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.120
-Yeah, right.

24:35.120 --> 24:36.630
OK, sorry.

24:36.630 --> 24:39.090
Look, it is not a big deal.

24:39.090 --> 24:39.920
-She's my best friend.

24:39.920 --> 24:42.090
It's a big deal.

24:42.090 --> 24:43.290
-OK.

24:43.290 --> 24:44.690
I'm sorry.

24:44.690 --> 24:46.240
It's over.

24:46.240 --> 24:51.070
It's never going to happen
again, especially now.

24:51.070 --> 24:56.830
And I got to tell you, I mean,
I've been dying to tell you.

24:56.830 --> 24:59.650
Raquel and me?

24:59.650 --> 25:02.730
I'm in love.

25:02.730 --> 25:03.550
-Really?

25:03.550 --> 25:04.310
-Yeah.

25:04.310 --> 25:05.380
-You're in love with the rabbi?

25:05.380 --> 25:06.080
-Yeah.

25:09.230 --> 25:09.970
-Wow.

25:09.970 --> 25:11.270
You're in love.

25:11.270 --> 25:12.590
Thank you for telling me that.

25:12.590 --> 25:13.380
Congratulations.

25:13.380 --> 25:14.080
I got to go.

25:18.710 --> 25:21.000
-So I have four
bottles of Percocet

25:21.000 --> 25:23.540
from when I had the
brachial cyst removed.

25:23.540 --> 25:26.340
And you know, that
can just grind it up

25:26.340 --> 25:27.620
and, you know, and
then it'll be good.

25:27.620 --> 25:28.830
-So four bottles does it?

25:28.830 --> 25:31.690
-Yeah, that's what they-- that's
what they say, it's enough,

25:31.690 --> 25:37.150
and you put it-- grind
it and put in the IV.

25:37.150 --> 25:39.180
-Well, it looks like
you did you homework.

25:39.180 --> 25:40.150
-I had to.

25:40.150 --> 25:41.450
I had to.

25:41.450 --> 25:43.420
-So we're-- we're
really doing this?

25:55.200 --> 25:57.180
-Or you could have
a wonderful shiva.

25:57.180 --> 25:59.580
-Oh, a shiva.

25:59.580 --> 26:03.000
We could have a great shiva.

26:03.000 --> 26:03.920
JOSH: It's a great idea.

26:03.920 --> 26:05.120
SARAH: We should
do it at the house.

26:05.120 --> 26:06.180
SHELLY: No, no, no.

26:06.180 --> 26:08.430
If we're going to do a shiva,
we're going to do it here.

26:08.430 --> 26:10.320
MAURA: But we have a big house.

26:10.320 --> 26:11.670
SHELLY: I've already
got the stuff.

26:11.670 --> 26:12.720
SARAH: What do you mean?
What supplies?

26:12.720 --> 26:14.330
What shiva supplies do
you have lying around?

26:14.330 --> 26:18.530
SHELLY: I have the napkins
and I have the stirrers

26:18.530 --> 26:20.000
and I have the mustard.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.170
-Guys, she has the mustard.

26:21.170 --> 26:22.330
SARAH: No seriously,
Tammy's been

26:22.330 --> 26:23.810
dying to throw something
at [INAUDIBLE].

26:57.110 --> 26:59.060
-My friend Harry Finkelstein--

26:59.060 --> 27:01.890
-Oh, I love this one. [LAUGHS]

27:01.890 --> 27:03.810
-So my friend,
Harry Finkelstein,

27:03.810 --> 27:05.760
went to the doctors the
other day to pick up his

27:05.760 --> 27:07.780
wife's-- the blood test results.

27:07.780 --> 27:11.260
The nurse said there was a
terrible mistake at the lab.

27:11.260 --> 27:13.250
There were two
Mrs. Finkelstein's.

27:13.250 --> 27:15.180
One Mrs. Finkelstein's
results came

27:15.180 --> 27:17.210
back positive for Alzheimer's.

27:17.210 --> 27:20.540
The other Mrs. Finkelstein
tested positive for the clap.

27:20.540 --> 27:23.930
So Harry says, why don't
you take another test?

27:23.930 --> 27:26.240
The nurse says the
insurance won't cover that.

27:26.240 --> 27:27.060
-That can't be true.

27:27.060 --> 27:28.220
-Shut up, I want to hear this.

27:28.220 --> 27:32.690
-So Harry says, my wife
either has Alzheimer's or VD?

27:32.690 --> 27:36.350
Well, what the hell
am I supposed to do?

27:36.350 --> 27:39.210
-The nurse says, drop
her off in Burbank.

27:39.210 --> 27:42.900
If she finds her way home,
don't sleep with her.

27:42.900 --> 27:44.320
[LAUGHTER]

27:44.320 --> 27:46.700
-Oh, that's so good.

27:46.700 --> 27:48.450
Tells a mean joke.

27:48.450 --> 27:51.820
-Not too mean, but a joke.

27:51.820 --> 27:53.420
I'm just here to make you happy.

27:56.660 --> 27:57.360
L'chaim.

28:00.030 --> 28:22.530
