00:03.204 --> 00:05.170
<i> - Yeah, I'll be there</i>
<i> Wednesday.</i>

00:05.239 --> 00:06.972
- Maybe we do a murder mystery.

00:07.041 --> 00:09.141
<i> - You need to have some kind</i>
<i> of a love triangle</i>

00:09.210 --> 00:10.309
<i> with a couple fights.</i>

00:10.378 --> 00:12.277
- That's not her.
- It is.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.380
- Jenni's invested
in this couple we saw fighting.

00:14.448 --> 00:16.248
- That was her
with a different guy.

00:16.317 --> 00:18.684
See? This is gonna turn
into [bleep] "Dateline"

00:18.753 --> 00:20.152
in, like, three days.

00:20.221 --> 00:21.553
- No, no, no, no.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.088
[overlapping shouting]

00:23.157 --> 00:25.257
- Oh, no.
[all shouting]

00:25.326 --> 00:26.358
- Oh, my--
- No!

00:27.828 --> 00:29.161
<i> - ♪ Get crazy, get wild ♪</i>

00:29.230 --> 00:30.863
<i> - Yeah, buddy!</i>

00:30.931 --> 00:32.998
<i> - Party's here!</i>

00:33.067 --> 00:35.501
<i> - The Situation</i>
<i> is under construction.</i>

00:35.569 --> 00:38.003
<i> - We're so classy now.</i>

00:38.072 --> 00:40.272
<i> - On the seventh day,</i>
<i> it'll be lit.</i>

00:40.341 --> 00:43.008
<i> - Get the frig out of here,</i>
<i> you crazy!</i>

00:43.077 --> 00:44.743
<i> - Um, hello?</i>

00:44.812 --> 00:47.946

00:52.686 --> 00:54.286
<i> ♪ I got murder on my mind ♪</i>

00:54.355 --> 00:55.287
- Somebody straight up
got murdered.

00:55.356 --> 00:56.955
- What?
- Oh, my God.

00:57.024 --> 00:58.257
- Somebody just
got murdered, bro.

00:58.325 --> 00:59.391
- Stop, stop.

01:01.128 --> 01:02.561
I planned this
murder mystery prank.

01:02.630 --> 01:03.562
- No!

01:03.631 --> 01:04.930
- Oh, my God.

01:04.999 --> 01:06.665
- Everyone is falling for it.

01:07.668 --> 01:08.801
- Somebody get them out.

01:08.869 --> 01:10.402
- What was that?
- Start doing CPR.

01:10.471 --> 01:12.871
Come on. Go harder!
Go down harder!

01:12.940 --> 01:14.940
<i> - Angelina was, like,</i>
<i> freaking out.</i>

01:15.009 --> 01:16.608
- Just someone let me in!

01:16.677 --> 01:18.143
- She might friggin' blow
the whole thing.

01:18.212 --> 01:19.711
Where is security
to get them out?

01:19.780 --> 01:21.647
- Yeah, but he's gotta
press harder down!

01:21.715 --> 01:22.948
- They know how to do it.
They're medics. They're medics.

01:23.017 --> 01:25.084
- They're not. They're not
even pressing down hard.

01:26.887 --> 01:28.787
- We gotta go.
- No, we're not going.

01:28.856 --> 01:31.423
Where can you tell us
to [bleep] go?

01:31.492 --> 01:34.560
How do you, like, expect us
to just [bleep] leave someone?

01:38.365 --> 01:40.532
- What the [bleep]?
Are you kidding me?

01:40.601 --> 01:42.000
- There's nothing we can do
to help him, you guys.

01:42.069 --> 01:44.069
- I would like to know
if he's alive or not.

01:44.138 --> 01:47.005
- Did you call 911?

01:47.074 --> 01:49.608
- That was the same guy
with the girl.

01:49.677 --> 01:50.976
That was the same guy
with the girl.

01:51.045 --> 01:53.979
- That's her. She's with
another man holding his hand.

01:54.048 --> 01:55.581
- No, time out.

01:55.649 --> 01:57.049
- Maybe that girl
that he was with,

01:57.118 --> 01:59.151
maybe, you know,
something happened.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.586
- See, no one better
could have found him.

02:00.654 --> 02:02.154
- No one better
could have found them.

02:02.223 --> 02:03.188
- [laughs softly]

02:03.257 --> 02:05.190
Yeah, I'm an actress.

02:05.259 --> 02:06.925
Give me an Emmy, bitches.

02:06.994 --> 02:10.295
<i> [sweeping music]</i>

02:10.364 --> 02:12.197
No!
[sobs]

02:13.400 --> 02:14.633
You think they killed
that other guy?

02:14.702 --> 02:15.734
- I don't know.
I mean, we're jumping

02:15.803 --> 02:17.035
to conclusions,
but it's possible.

02:17.104 --> 02:18.470
Everything's possible.
I mean, I don't know.

02:18.539 --> 02:21.907
- This is going way better
than I thought.

02:21.976 --> 02:25.844
- The same girl
with the red hair--

02:25.913 --> 02:27.779
he had no shirt on too.

02:27.848 --> 02:29.314
- They're talking
about this couple.

02:29.383 --> 02:31.383
<i> They're talking</i>
<i> about her cheating.</i>

02:31.452 --> 02:33.485
Oh, my God, this is perfect.
[laughs]

02:33.554 --> 02:36.054
- Let's say it's the guy that
just passed the pool, right?

02:36.123 --> 02:37.656
- I don't think it could have
happened so fast.

02:37.725 --> 02:39.057
- That's why I don't believe
it's a drowning--

02:39.126 --> 02:41.226
- Unless he was unconscious.
- And then she bounced.

02:41.295 --> 02:43.262
- [bleep] scary.
- Yeah, of course.

02:43.330 --> 02:46.165
- Listen, life's gonna happen
on life's terms sometimes.

02:46.233 --> 02:47.566
- Mike, shut up
with the quotes.

02:47.635 --> 02:48.934
[laughter]

02:49.003 --> 02:51.937
I just saw a [bleep] dead guy.
Shut the [bleep] up.

02:52.006 --> 02:53.639
I'm trying to think
happy thoughts.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.274
I'm trying to think about,
like, my jump rope.

02:55.342 --> 02:57.176
<i> I'm trying to think</i>
<i> about chicken cutlets</i>

02:57.244 --> 02:59.912
but I kinda think
I lost my appetite.

02:59.980 --> 03:00.946
- I mean--

03:01.015 --> 03:01.980
- They should look
at that redhead.

03:02.049 --> 03:03.582
- She walked in with a guy.

03:05.586 --> 03:07.719
Then at the end of the night,
she's with another guy.

03:08.923 --> 03:10.255
This didn't look right for me.

03:10.324 --> 03:12.124
- We just witnessed
a murder, bro.

03:12.193 --> 03:13.625
- [laughs]

03:13.694 --> 03:15.294
- I wanna know
where the husband is.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.729
- Maybe the husband did it.
Just push--just pushed him

03:17.798 --> 03:19.364
in the pool out of nowhere
and just ran.

03:19.433 --> 03:20.766
<i> Like, I don't know</i>
<i> if this is a murder.</i>

03:20.834 --> 03:22.234
None of us know.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.336
This is actually, like, really
frightening at this point.

03:24.405 --> 03:26.271
- This right now
is a crime scene.

03:26.340 --> 03:27.606
- Oh, man.

03:27.675 --> 03:28.974
- So here's the deal.

03:29.043 --> 03:30.475
You guys, I don't know
if you guys just saw

03:30.544 --> 03:32.010
all the sirens and cop cars.

03:32.079 --> 03:34.112
They're probably gonna come and
ask us a bunch of questions.

03:34.181 --> 03:36.448
- I think we're all suspects
at this point.

03:36.517 --> 03:37.616
This is madness.

03:37.685 --> 03:38.917
This is actually happening
right now.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.686
I feel like
I'm on a crime show.

03:43.424 --> 03:45.357
- Wait, guys. Our stories
have to match up here.

03:45.426 --> 03:48.093
[laughter]

03:48.162 --> 03:49.328
- Vinny's scared, bro.

03:51.432 --> 03:53.966
- "Jersey Shore" cast gets
questioned for a murder.

03:54.034 --> 03:55.367
- So how you guys doing?

03:55.436 --> 03:56.535
- Pretty good.
- Good, how are you?

03:56.604 --> 03:58.737
- First of all,
there's been an incident.

03:58.806 --> 03:59.871
You guys are aware of.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.306
I'm just asking you
some questions.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.475
- So this is the next part
of my plan.

04:03.544 --> 04:07.813
He needs to be in full acting
mode and really sell it.

04:07.881 --> 04:10.782
- Which one of you came up
on the--the incident first?

04:10.851 --> 04:11.850
<i> [tense music]</i>

04:11.919 --> 04:13.919
- God. Me.

04:13.988 --> 04:16.855
So I just saw a body floating
and then I freaked out.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.724
That was it.
- Okay. So--

04:18.792 --> 04:20.759
- Vinny did it! Vinny did it!

04:20.828 --> 04:22.427
- Oh, my God.

04:22.496 --> 04:24.796
- Take it serious, guys.
Seriously.

04:24.865 --> 04:26.665
Like, it's not--please.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.033
- Was the body face up,
face down?

04:28.102 --> 04:29.468
- Face up.
- Okay.

04:29.536 --> 04:31.303
- You are?
- Michael.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.304
- Michael.

04:32.373 --> 04:33.639
- I am not a stranger

04:33.707 --> 04:36.241
to being interrogated
by the law.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.377
[laughs]
Unfortunately.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.812
I thought the man
from a distance looked like

04:40.881 --> 04:43.081
he was either on drugs
or had too much to drink.

04:43.150 --> 04:45.284
- They both looked under
the influence of something.

04:45.352 --> 04:47.052
- How would you know
if he was on drugs, or...

04:47.121 --> 04:49.888
- We've all been drunk before,
personally.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.790
- Okay.

04:51.859 --> 04:53.792
- So does anybody else
have anything to add?

04:53.861 --> 04:56.762
- We might have seen him prior
with a female.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.397
- What did she look like?

04:58.465 --> 05:01.700
- Redhead, probably early 40s
in a black dress.

05:01.769 --> 05:04.536
- Let's get a timeframe on this
for Officer Rice.

05:04.605 --> 05:06.738
Maybe we can get
the actual names of the pools

05:06.807 --> 05:08.106
because they're all named.

05:08.175 --> 05:10.142
<i> - I do feel bad.</i>
- She pushed him.

05:10.210 --> 05:11.610
Yeah, maybe
that's what she did.

05:11.679 --> 05:14.813
- I have to tell them we're
at a murder mystery dinner.

05:14.882 --> 05:17.182
Okay, I just have
to say something.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.519
Um...

05:22.323 --> 05:24.790
Welcome to murder mystery
dinner!

05:24.858 --> 05:26.024
- Are you [bleep]--
[all shouting]

05:26.093 --> 05:29.227
- Yo, [bleep],
are you [bleep] kidding me?

05:29.296 --> 05:31.897
- Throw Deena in the pool!
Throw Deena in the pool!

05:33.734 --> 05:36.134
- I can't believe it. What?

05:36.203 --> 05:39.304
You're terrible.
Wait, who was involved?

05:39.373 --> 05:40.305
- Did you know?

05:40.374 --> 05:42.140
- Yeah.
- Oh, you [bleep].

05:42.209 --> 05:44.009
- And everybody here.
- What?

05:44.078 --> 05:46.945
- They put everything together,
like the cameras.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.680
- [bleep] you people.

05:48.749 --> 05:49.948
You guys suck.
- [bleep].

05:50.017 --> 05:52.484
- Wow.
They played you guys.

05:52.553 --> 05:54.486
- You made me cry.

05:54.555 --> 05:55.954
- So what's happening,

05:56.023 --> 05:57.889
this is a murder
mystery dinner.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.124
I wanted to do a fun event--

05:59.193 --> 06:01.626
- Oh, my God.
- This is fun to you?

06:01.695 --> 06:03.695
- Well, it wasn't supposed
to go that far.

06:03.764 --> 06:07.065
- A little on the dark side,
but good prank.

06:07.134 --> 06:08.266
It was just dark.

06:08.335 --> 06:10.068
<i> Like, Deena went to places</i>

06:10.137 --> 06:12.471
that the prank war champion
wouldn't even go.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.740
- Gangster.
- I give her props for that.

06:14.808 --> 06:17.275
You're sick. You're sick.

06:17.344 --> 06:19.745
- You had him good.
- I should be an actress!

06:19.813 --> 06:22.447
- That was the darkest thing
I've ever seen, Deena.

06:22.516 --> 06:24.516
- I need therapy.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.485
- I-I really don't believe
anybody these days,

06:26.553 --> 06:28.954
so I was definitely
not shook in any way.

06:29.022 --> 06:31.590
- Well, I don't wanna see
dead bodies though.

06:31.658 --> 06:34.526
- But then I turned it
into a fun night, I feel.

06:35.195 --> 06:37.829
You're gonna see the actors.
They're alive.

06:37.898 --> 06:38.930
Like...

06:39.666 --> 06:42.834
- That was the best prank I've
ever actually seen in my life.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.970
- I don't know.
I wouldn't say that.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.439
<i> - Judgey Lauren's like,</i>

06:47.508 --> 06:49.908
"Ugh.

06:49.977 --> 06:51.943
[sighing]"

06:52.012 --> 06:53.378
<i> Calm down, Laurens.</i>

06:53.447 --> 06:55.680
- That was so fun.
Who doesn't love a prank?

06:55.749 --> 06:58.483
- Deena was screaming in there.
You just couldn't--I couldn't.

06:58.552 --> 07:01.319
- It was a very
traumatic experience.

07:01.388 --> 07:03.755
- That was [bleep]
a [bleep] image.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.323
<i> [tense music]</i>
- Okay. Well, whatever.

07:05.392 --> 07:06.691
So I'm [bleep] up.

07:06.760 --> 07:07.959
- Yeah.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.461
- I'm a terrible person.

07:09.530 --> 07:11.863
Everybody should put me
on a fire.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.598
<i> It was a prank. It was a joke.</i>

07:13.667 --> 07:16.868
Like, sorry.
Like, welcome to the family.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.037
Whatever.
Anybody else would've done it.

07:19.106 --> 07:21.373
- You put us
all through such trauma.

07:21.442 --> 07:23.041
I'm kidding. Calm down.

07:23.110 --> 07:26.311
- No, because there's a lot
of hypocrites at this table.

07:26.380 --> 07:27.612
- Well, I think that

07:27.681 --> 07:29.014
if we did this to you,
you would be upset.

07:29.082 --> 07:30.282
- You would be really upset.

07:30.350 --> 07:31.716
- No, I would [bleep]
roll with it

07:31.785 --> 07:33.385
because I knew
what we were doing here.

07:33.454 --> 07:36.755
- Whoo, I think Deena
just had built up a rope.

07:36.824 --> 07:38.089
Built up, built up.

07:38.158 --> 07:40.058
- You also have a baby
to go to.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.827
- I'm not pushing it
because I brought people

07:41.895 --> 07:44.129
to take care of him.
That's why, okay?

07:44.198 --> 07:46.198
So like, please.
- And bam.

07:46.266 --> 07:48.767
- He [bleep] consented.
He's [bleep] alive.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.035
<i> [tense music]</i>

07:50.103 --> 07:52.070
- It came to a head.
- I was a good actress.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.673
You would have done
exactly what I did.

07:54.741 --> 07:55.674
So let's be real.

38:33.178 --> 38:34.878
- So I was the takeout girl.

38:34.946 --> 38:37.213
We had some guy called up.
He placed his order.

38:37.282 --> 38:39.582
I put everything in the bag,
even threw an extra [bleep]

38:39.651 --> 38:41.551
pumpernickel bread
for that [bleep].

38:41.620 --> 38:42.952
- Wow.
- Okay?

38:43.021 --> 38:45.188
He asked for garlic mash,
but over the phone,

38:45.257 --> 38:46.456
I didn't hear the garlic,

38:46.525 --> 38:49.592
so I put the regular mash
in there, not knowing.

38:49.661 --> 38:51.594
Comes back and he goes,
"Excuse me."

38:51.663 --> 38:53.229
He drops his bag.
He's like,

38:53.298 --> 38:55.665
"I asked you for [bleep]
garlic mash.

38:55.734 --> 38:57.500
"This is [bleep] regular mash.

38:57.569 --> 39:00.170
I want some [bleep] garlic mash
right [bleep] now."

39:00.238 --> 39:02.138
So now I walk into
the [bleep] back,

39:02.207 --> 39:03.573
and I'm like, you know what?

39:03.642 --> 39:05.475
[bleep] this piece of [bleep].

39:05.544 --> 39:08.144
[bleep].
- [laughs]

39:08.213 --> 39:10.447
- Went into the back,
walked to the bathroom.

39:10.515 --> 39:12.048
- Oh, my God.

39:12.117 --> 39:14.250
- Went into the stall.
I went...

39:14.319 --> 39:15.852
<i> [liquid sloshing]</i>

39:15.921 --> 39:18.888
- No, you didn't.
No, you didn't.

39:18.957 --> 39:21.458
- Like what the what?

39:21.526 --> 39:24.060
- I went back to the kitchen.
None of my coworkers knew.

39:24.129 --> 39:26.796
Took the scooper, scooped
the [bleep] garlic mash on top.

39:26.865 --> 39:28.498
- No, you--no way.
- That's crazy.

39:28.567 --> 39:30.667
- Like nothing even
[bleep] happened.

39:31.636 --> 39:32.902
- I'm speechless.

39:32.971 --> 39:35.672
- I peed in that [bleep]
and I don't give a [bleep].

39:35.741 --> 39:38.208
- I'm--I don't even know
what to say.

39:38.276 --> 39:40.110
- You guys are so sick.

39:41.646 --> 39:43.113
- Well, well, well,

39:43.181 --> 39:44.814
it would suck if it rained
through your party.

39:44.883 --> 39:47.450
Oh, man.
I don't know what I would do.

39:47.519 --> 39:49.519
- Did you try to put
the maloik on me?

39:49.588 --> 39:51.554
- I'm looking at
my radar right now.

39:51.623 --> 39:54.724
- I have a feeling that this is
just gonna just pass right by.

39:54.793 --> 39:56.126
- I think it already passed by.

39:56.194 --> 39:58.361
- No, my radar
tells me different.

39:58.430 --> 39:59.863
Maybe this is God's way
of saying like,

39:59.931 --> 40:01.664
"Bro, you've had
enough parties."

40:01.733 --> 40:02.866
It's a doozy, this one.

40:02.934 --> 40:04.401
Looks like it's heading
right towards us.

40:04.469 --> 40:06.703
Sucks. That sucks.
I have my weather app.

40:06.772 --> 40:08.671
That's us, the little blue dot,

40:08.740 --> 40:14.043
and there's a little line
of rainfall coming through.

40:14.112 --> 40:17.647
This sucks. Party's rained out.

40:27.726 --> 40:29.492

40:29.561 --> 40:31.027

It's gonna go right past us.

40:40.105 --> 40:42.071
Wouldn't miss

a couple of hours.

40:44.576 --> 40:46.109
Another party for Mike.
- This guy is salty, man.

40:46.178 --> 40:47.444
- What do you say
we just cancel it?
