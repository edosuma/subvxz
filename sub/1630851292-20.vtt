Boy, oh, boy.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.290
- Is it Friday yet?
- Tomorrow.

00:40.290 --> 00:43.043
And actually, in Tasmania,
it's already Friday.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.753
I thought you'd be more fun.

00:44.753 --> 00:46.755
Griffin, you'll be very happy to know

00:46.755 --> 00:47.881
I've finished conducting

00:47.881 --> 00:49.841
my employee productivity evaluations.

00:49.841 --> 00:51.426
I used a system called

00:51.426 --> 00:53.178
the Determining Employee Advancement,

00:53.178 --> 00:56.348
Duties, Work-Engagement,
Intelligence-Gains Hourly Test,

00:56.348 --> 00:57.766
or DEADWEIGHT.

00:57.766 --> 00:59.184
And my results show you

00:59.184 --> 01:01.436
to be the brewery's
least productive employee.

01:01.436 --> 01:04.272
- So, pack your bags.
- I'm fired?

01:04.356 --> 01:07.442
No, you're going on a business trip
with me as my assistant,

01:07.442 --> 01:09.319
since you won't be missed at the office.

01:09.319 --> 01:10.904
We're meeting with
our New Jersey distributor

01:10.904 --> 01:12.030
in Atlantic City.

01:12.030 --> 01:14.032
Everyone, I'll be away on business

01:14.032 --> 01:15.658
for a few days starting tomorrow,

01:15.742 --> 01:17.535
so we're bringing in a substitute boss.

01:17.619 --> 01:19.120
I hope he's a hard-ass.

01:19.204 --> 01:20.872
But what if he's wearing jeans?

01:20.872 --> 01:23.249
Hey, guys, my first name is Dan,

01:23.333 --> 01:25.460
which is what you'll all call me.

01:25.460 --> 01:28.463
Now, who wants to watch <i>Ratatouille?</i>

01:36.513 --> 01:37.722
Oh!

01:37.806 --> 01:40.433
Sorry, that guy over there tripped me.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.268
Mr. Edwards, the guidance counselor?

01:42.352 --> 01:44.562
Yeah, the bullying
in this school has gotten

01:44.646 --> 01:46.022
a little out of hand.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.649
You must be Heather, the new girl.

01:47.649 --> 01:49.067
How'd you know I was new?

01:49.067 --> 01:51.277
I'm Quahog's number-three Realtor.

01:51.361 --> 01:53.238
I really wanted to sell
that house to your folks,

01:53.238 --> 01:56.116
but you're in great hands with Gil.

01:58.785 --> 01:59.994
What's this?

02:00.078 --> 02:01.496
Principal Shepherd is directing

02:01.496 --> 02:02.914
an adaptation of Baz Luhrmann's

02:02.914 --> 02:04.833
<i>William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.</i>

02:04.833 --> 02:07.293
The local Ruth's Chris Steak House
is sponsoring it.

02:07.377 --> 02:08.962
I'm playing Juliet.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.797
Wow. You're Juliet

02:10.797 --> 02:12.590
in Ruth's Chris's Principal Shepherd's

02:12.674 --> 02:14.509
Baz Luhrmann's <i>William Shakespeare's</i>

02:14.509 --> 02:16.219
<i>Romeo and Juliet?</i>

02:16.219 --> 02:17.762
Yes, it's great,

02:17.846 --> 02:19.806
but we're auditioning for a new Romeo.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.391
The parents of the boy we cast said

02:21.391 --> 02:23.435
he needed emergency conversion therapy.

02:23.435 --> 02:24.978
Anyway, nice to meet you, Chris.

02:33.486 --> 02:36.031
I have to be in that play.

02:36.031 --> 02:37.699
Nice hat, dork!

02:37.699 --> 02:41.453
That's not nice, Mrs. Danneman,
the elderly school nurse.

02:44.539 --> 02:46.249
Peter, is something wrong?

02:46.249 --> 02:47.459
We've been here an hour,

02:47.459 --> 02:48.877
and you've hardly touched your penis.

02:48.877 --> 02:50.545
It's not like you. It's getting cold.

02:50.545 --> 02:51.921
Sorry, guys.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.798
I just found out
I have to meet my stupid boss

02:53.882 --> 02:55.967
in Atlantic City for a business trip.

02:56.051 --> 02:57.677
Peter, business trips are great.

02:57.761 --> 03:00.513
Yeah, haven't you seen
<i>Cedar Rapids</i> with Ed Helms?

03:00.597 --> 03:02.807
He plays a salesman
who goes to a conference

03:02.891 --> 03:04.059
in the titular city.

03:04.059 --> 03:06.144
There, he encounters
three repeat attendees

03:06.144 --> 03:08.605
who lead him
on a profound weekend journey,

03:08.605 --> 03:12.275
equal parts hope and self-discovery.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.112
I memorize
Rotten Tomatoes movie descriptions.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.073
You'll have one meeting,
and then the rest of the time

03:18.073 --> 03:20.367
- you just party.
- Party with Preston?

03:20.367 --> 03:21.951
But he doesn't drink.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.828
I wish you guys could come.

03:23.912 --> 03:25.622
Wait a minute. Why not?

03:25.622 --> 03:27.123
You guys should drive down with me.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.708
- All right!
- Let's do it!

03:28.792 --> 03:30.669
<i>Cedar Rapids,</i> rated R for drug use

03:30.669 --> 03:32.796
and mild sexual content!

03:32.796 --> 03:34.422
I've never been to Atlantic City.

03:34.506 --> 03:37.384
Let's just watch this ad
from their tourism department.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.302
<i>Welcome to Atlantic City,</i>

03:39.386 --> 03:42.389
<i>the inspiration for
Bruce Springsteen's saddest song.</i>

03:42.389 --> 03:45.767
<i>Want to see brown ocean water
stained with gasoline rainbows?</i>

03:45.767 --> 03:47.560
<i>Come on down to Atlantic City!</i>

03:47.644 --> 03:50.730
<i>Love to watch guys with no noses
fight women with trach holes?</i>

03:50.814 --> 03:52.315
<i>You're in luck!</i>

03:52.399 --> 03:54.526
<i>And if you're wondering
where Taylor Hicks has been,</i>

03:54.526 --> 03:55.819
<i>he's here!</i>

03:55.819 --> 03:58.196
<i>In a small lounge with a low stage.</i>

03:58.196 --> 03:59.656
<i>Atlantic City!</i>

03:59.656 --> 04:02.492
<i>Come flick a lit cigarette
at a dealer today!</i>

04:06.830 --> 04:09.874
"Published by the Samuel French Company,

04:09.958 --> 04:13.044
"New York, copyright this ed.

MCMLXX."

04:15.964 --> 04:18.508
- What are you doing?
- Reading <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

04:18.508 --> 04:19.843
We're doing it at school,

04:19.843 --> 04:22.512
and this girl I like is playing Juliet.

04:22.512 --> 04:25.098
I'm going to audition for Romeo.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.975
There's kissing.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.768
Chris, listen, acting isn't easy.

04:28.852 --> 04:30.228
You're going to need some help.

04:32.522 --> 04:35.650
See what I'm doing? Scarf, a high stool?

04:35.734 --> 04:38.153
One leg up, hands clasped over knee?

04:38.153 --> 04:39.779
Engaged and in the moment.

04:39.863 --> 04:40.905
Do you know what this means?

04:40.989 --> 04:43.199
- You're gay...
- An acting coach, yes.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.535
What does a baby know about acting?

04:45.535 --> 04:47.370
Yes, I'm a baby.

04:47.454 --> 04:48.955
It's hard being youngest,

04:49.039 --> 04:51.166
always looking for a way
to distinguish myself,

04:51.166 --> 04:53.001
to contribute.

04:56.379 --> 04:58.298
Stewie, I-I didn't mean it.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.759
Neither did I. That was acting, Chris.

05:00.759 --> 05:02.510
Wow. You're amazing.

05:02.594 --> 05:04.512
Do you think you can
give me some pointers?

05:04.596 --> 05:06.723
It will be my great honor.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.308
That was also acting.

05:12.479 --> 05:13.855
Thought I'd swing by work first

05:13.855 --> 05:15.357
and pick up a case of beer for the road.

05:15.357 --> 05:17.901
Then we're off.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.363
Hear him breathe?

05:21.363 --> 05:23.823
AC's on full blast,
and he's covered in sweat.

05:23.907 --> 05:25.408
Lois'll be a widow soon, right?

05:25.492 --> 05:27.118
Yeah, he's circling the drain.

05:27.202 --> 05:29.371
And let me guess-- no estate planning?

05:29.371 --> 05:32.207
Would you guys tell me
if my car smelled this bad?

05:32.207 --> 05:35.043
Everywhere I look,
I see another stray french fry.

05:35.043 --> 05:37.420
Hey, guys? I know I'm new to the group,

05:37.504 --> 05:39.172
but Peter's not here to defend himself,

05:39.172 --> 05:41.675
so I don't think it's right for us
to talk about him like this.

05:50.225 --> 05:51.810
Griffin? What are you doing here?

05:52.894 --> 05:54.229
Oh, hey, Preston.

05:54.229 --> 05:56.189
Why do you have a case of beer?

05:56.189 --> 05:59.192
Oh. Oh, this? Um, uh, samples.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.486
- For clients.
- Excellent idea.

06:01.486 --> 06:04.239
Say, why don't you just drive me?

06:04.239 --> 06:06.866
That way I can be productive
the entire trip.

06:06.950 --> 06:09.577
It'll be like <i>Green Book,</i>
a movie I only saw

06:09.661 --> 06:11.079
because I believed it to be a book.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.997
Oh, yeah, you know,
I once tried to read <i>Jaws</i>

06:13.081 --> 06:14.374
'cause I thought it was the movie.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.835
Couldn't go into a library
for years after that.

06:16.835 --> 06:19.504
Guys, listen, Preston
wants to drive with me.

06:19.504 --> 06:22.173
He can't know you're all coming,
so everyone in the way back.

06:22.257 --> 06:24.009
I'm not hiding in the back of your car.

06:24.009 --> 06:26.720
Why? There's nothing in there
except for Lois' jog bras.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.722
All right, you heard the man! Everyone in!

06:30.932 --> 06:32.183
These are Meg's! We've been duped!

06:32.267 --> 06:33.768
Hop in, boss.

06:33.852 --> 06:35.687
If I speed, we can make it in four hours.

06:35.687 --> 06:38.064
You'll do a steady 55 miles per hour,

06:38.148 --> 06:40.233
and we will stop
to read historical markers

06:40.233 --> 06:42.027
along the way.

06:42.027 --> 06:43.278
Starting with the Museum

06:43.278 --> 06:45.697
of Black Guy Mustaches.
Oh!

06:56.958 --> 06:57.876
Some hotel.

06:57.876 --> 06:59.336
They only had smoking rooms

06:59.336 --> 07:01.046
and very smoking rooms.

07:01.046 --> 07:03.798
Check it out, a stack
of prewritten suicide notes.

07:03.882 --> 07:06.301
All you have to do is sign your name.

07:06.301 --> 07:08.053
This place has everything.

07:08.053 --> 07:10.388
I wish there were more than two beds.

07:10.472 --> 07:11.973
I'll just sleep in my chair.

07:12.057 --> 07:13.433
You sleep sitting up, Joe?

07:13.433 --> 07:15.310
Yeah, Bonnie puts a falcon hood on me,

07:15.310 --> 07:16.728
and I go right out.

07:17.812 --> 07:20.815
I'm calm and no longer motivated by prey.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.109
Griffin, open up.

07:23.193 --> 07:24.736
Guys, hide in the shower.

07:27.030 --> 07:28.782
Hello, Griffin. I'm right next door

07:28.782 --> 07:30.408
in a slightly larger room.

07:30.492 --> 07:32.118
Seems like an unnecessary detail.

07:32.202 --> 07:33.953
Here is this weekend's itinerary.

07:34.037 --> 07:35.705
We're working all weekend?!

07:35.789 --> 07:38.541
Griffin, our New Jersey distributor
is threatening

07:38.625 --> 07:41.169
to drop our beer in favor of hard seltzer,

07:41.169 --> 07:42.796
because... New Jersey.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.214
I need to convince them

07:44.214 --> 07:46.549
that we are the best
scumbag beverage around.

07:46.633 --> 07:49.219
If we lose this account,
we lose the brewery.

07:49.219 --> 07:51.554
And then it's time
to cast open the windows

07:51.638 --> 07:53.640
and drop to the freedom of the pavement.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.351
I read that in a stack
of suicide notes in my room.

07:56.351 --> 07:58.978
See you at 1800 hours, Peter.

07:59.062 --> 08:00.647
I better shower because I have no idea

08:00.647 --> 08:02.732
how soon or late that is.

08:04.859 --> 08:06.027
Hey!
Aah!

08:06.111 --> 08:07.612
What the hell?!
Sorry, I forgot.

08:07.696 --> 08:09.114
Why are you at half-mast?

08:09.114 --> 08:11.866
I'm 45, Joe. That's full mast.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.665
Chris, any good acting coach will tell you

08:18.665 --> 08:21.543
that before your audition,
it's important to warm up.

08:21.543 --> 08:23.586
Now, let's improv. Give me a location.

08:23.670 --> 08:24.921
Stewie's bedroom.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.923
Okay, maybe just
spend another second on...

08:27.007 --> 08:28.466
Stewie's bedroom!

08:28.550 --> 08:30.260
Okay, fine. And a profession?

08:30.260 --> 08:31.594
Acting teacher.

08:31.678 --> 08:32.887
Again, maybe just give it one more...

08:32.971 --> 08:34.014
Failed actor?

08:34.014 --> 08:35.557
I got tired of playing their game!

08:35.557 --> 08:36.975
It's okay, Stewie.

08:36.975 --> 08:39.019
After a few noes, these young Brandos

08:39.019 --> 08:40.645
lose a little of their vinegar.

08:40.729 --> 08:43.481
Tell you what,
let's improv as Romeo and Juliet.

08:43.565 --> 08:45.984
You be he, I'll be she.

08:45.984 --> 08:47.569
Get in. Let's get in.

08:47.569 --> 08:49.696
I'd like permission to go inside, Juliet.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.031
Hi, Juliet!

08:51.031 --> 08:52.949
I'm not... I'm not there just yet.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.534
All right, Juliet is eluding me a little.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.911
My transformation is not yet complete.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.002
Hi, Juliet.

09:04.002 --> 09:05.378
Damn it, Chris! I'm not ready!

09:05.462 --> 09:07.380
But you were standing like a girl.

09:07.464 --> 09:09.090
My bodywork was perfect, yes,

09:09.174 --> 09:10.842
but I still hadn't touched the soul.

09:10.842 --> 09:12.344
All right, all right,
even though you're off

09:12.344 --> 09:13.928
to a rough start, it's okay.

09:14.012 --> 09:17.223
Even Michelangelo
wasn't appreciated until later in life.

09:17.307 --> 09:19.017
- Hey, how's Jakey doing?
- He's good.

09:19.017 --> 09:21.144
They got him building arches
over at the Coliseum.

09:21.144 --> 09:23.396
Big construction job. How about Mikey?

09:23.480 --> 09:25.065
Yeah, he's, um...

09:25.065 --> 09:27.067
he's been carving dongs out of marble.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.526
You know, something different.

09:36.743 --> 09:39.329
Wow. This place is... sad.

09:39.329 --> 09:41.331
I'm one of the skinniest guys here.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.833
Guys, Preston's coming. Beat it.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.335
I'm 11 seconds late.

09:45.335 --> 09:47.504
I'll credit you the time
in our two-minute break

09:47.504 --> 09:49.047
in 180 minutes.

09:49.047 --> 09:50.298
Let's work.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.677
"Pawtucket Patriot Ale:

09:53.677 --> 09:56.596
"The Best Carbonated
Fermented Alcoholic Beverage

09:56.680 --> 09:59.974
Made from Malted Cereal Grain
for the New Jersey Market."

10:00.058 --> 10:02.227
- Zing.
- That's not very catchy.

10:02.227 --> 10:04.145
I didn't bring you
for your opinions, Griffin.

10:04.229 --> 10:05.772
I brought you for your width.

10:05.772 --> 10:08.858
Now, stand up while I project
my presentation on your back.

10:12.821 --> 10:14.447
This is humiliating.

10:14.531 --> 10:16.032
I got to figure out a way
to escape Preston

10:16.116 --> 10:17.367
and join the guys.

10:17.367 --> 10:19.285
"Which is why our beer is the best beer

10:19.369 --> 10:20.662
for the Garden State."

10:20.662 --> 10:23.581
And now for a restorative
60-second power nap.

10:33.717 --> 10:35.552
You'll nail this audition, Chris.

10:35.552 --> 10:37.012
Behind you, fellas.

10:37.012 --> 10:39.180
- Oh, hi, Meg.
- That's not her.

10:39.264 --> 10:42.350
All high school theater tech girls
just look like Meg.

10:45.020 --> 10:47.272
Chris Griffin to the stage, please.

10:47.272 --> 10:49.149
Okay, Chris. Go time.

10:51.818 --> 10:55.363
Curtain rises, lights up, a story begins.

10:55.447 --> 10:58.408
And today our story is about a rising star

10:58.408 --> 11:02.287
in Constellation Showbiz Major:
Chris Griffin.

11:02.287 --> 11:03.913
At the Stewie Griffin Workshop,

11:03.997 --> 11:05.498
he's studied Commercial Technique

11:05.582 --> 11:07.042
and Acting for Camera,

11:07.042 --> 11:09.336
and will soon be seen
in a local news story

11:09.336 --> 11:11.463
about kids who throw stuff at birds.

11:11.463 --> 11:14.090
Enter... Chris.

11:14.174 --> 11:17.052
"She doth teach the torches to burn..."

11:17.052 --> 11:19.763
Great! It's fine, Chris. The part's yours.

11:19.763 --> 11:21.681
I got my first-ever response on Tinder,

11:21.765 --> 11:23.641
and I got to make this happen now.

11:23.725 --> 11:25.643
"Are you sure you're not

11:25.727 --> 11:28.897
"a baby pretending to be

11:28.897 --> 11:30.857
a middle-aged divorcée?"

11:30.857 --> 11:35.362
"Would a baby be wearing
a sheer chemise from Lane Bryant?"

11:35.362 --> 11:37.197
Chris, congratulations!

11:37.197 --> 11:38.823
We did it, Stewie.

11:38.907 --> 11:42.452
Oh, my God, I'm going to kiss Heather!

11:42.452 --> 11:43.995
Thanks again for all your help.

11:44.079 --> 11:46.039
Dear boy, I'm not going anywhere.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.874
My coaching will continue.

11:47.874 --> 11:50.543
Today's lesson:
Acting teachers are weirdos

11:50.627 --> 11:52.587
who always grab your hands like this,

11:52.671 --> 11:55.006
and you can't do anything about it.

11:55.090 --> 11:56.633
No! No.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.177
No.

12:04.265 --> 12:05.558
This is awesome.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.852
Here's to us, doing what we normally do,

12:07.936 --> 12:09.354
but in a different place.

12:10.355 --> 12:13.358
Griffin. I knew I'd find you in a bar.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.485
I am furious.

12:15.485 --> 12:17.195
But that doesn't mean
you shouldn't introduce me

12:17.195 --> 12:18.863
to your friends as a common courtesy.

12:18.947 --> 12:21.366
Oh, yeah. Uh, Quagmire, Cleveland, Joe.

12:21.366 --> 12:24.536
Want to see Sebastian Maniscalco
with us in the Stardust Room?

12:24.536 --> 12:26.454
He's that comedian who's always startled

12:26.538 --> 12:28.331
by the pasta he takes pictures with.

12:30.417 --> 12:33.336
No. I'm too busy trying to save our jobs.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.754
Go home, Griffin.

12:34.838 --> 12:37.132
You are useless to me and the brewery.

12:37.132 --> 12:39.467
You will never amount to anything at work.

12:39.551 --> 12:42.429
Oh, yeah? Well, you'll never
amount to anything at life.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.514
You don't know
how to make friends or have fun.

12:44.514 --> 12:46.891
You never even tasted the beer you sell.

12:46.975 --> 12:48.852
At least I know why it's special.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.021
Maybe you're right.

12:51.021 --> 12:53.023
I don't quite understand its appeal.

12:53.023 --> 12:54.524
Well, here's your chance.

13:11.124 --> 13:14.252
For the record,
I've never seen this movie.

13:16.338 --> 13:18.715
Actors onstage.

13:18.715 --> 13:21.509
I think you mean, company, positions!

13:21.593 --> 13:25.722
Now, this is the scene
where Mercutio warns Romeo

13:25.722 --> 13:28.433
about Juliet's angry brother Tybalt.

13:28.433 --> 13:29.851
Who's playing Mercutio?

13:29.851 --> 13:31.436
A ten-ounce bone-in rib eye.

13:33.730 --> 13:36.441
Man, Ruth's Chris really
has their hooks in this thing.

13:36.441 --> 13:38.651
Okay, Chris, move to the right.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.445
- Stage left.
- Heather, come forward.

13:40.445 --> 13:42.322
- Downstage.
- And to the right.

13:42.322 --> 13:43.823
- Stage left.
- Back up, Chris.

13:43.907 --> 13:44.908
Upstage, Chris.

13:44.908 --> 13:46.284
- Stop.
- Stage go.

13:46.368 --> 13:47.786
Am I scared of Tybalt?

13:47.786 --> 13:50.288
Yes, but Juliet can't know.

13:50.372 --> 13:51.581
I'm gonna build on that, if I may.

13:51.581 --> 13:52.999
Ignore that direction, Chris.

13:53.083 --> 13:56.211
No, Chris, follow the emotion
and take it further.

13:56.211 --> 13:58.129
Great note.
Chris, don't listen to the note.

13:58.213 --> 13:59.464
Take it further.

13:59.464 --> 14:01.091
Of course, absolutely take it further

14:01.091 --> 14:02.217
but in the opposite direction.

14:02.217 --> 14:03.426
Who's in charge here?

14:03.510 --> 14:05.220
I'm starting to wonder that myself.

14:05.220 --> 14:07.889
If you're trying to drive me
out of my own production,

14:07.889 --> 14:09.474
you've got another...

14:10.642 --> 14:12.727
Oh, my first response on Farmers Only.

14:12.811 --> 14:14.562
A divorcée in Ohio wants to show me

14:14.646 --> 14:17.232
her sheer Lane Bryant teddy.

14:17.232 --> 14:18.358
Fine. The show's yours.

14:26.116 --> 14:28.785
Oh, man, my head is killing me.

14:30.537 --> 14:33.498
Did... did we do something bad last night?

14:33.498 --> 14:35.083
Something really bad?

14:35.083 --> 14:37.419
Preston texted me at 2:00 a.m.

14:39.254 --> 14:40.380
What do we do?

14:40.380 --> 14:41.881
If Preston isn't at that presentation,

14:41.965 --> 14:43.466
the brewery's gonna go under!

14:46.678 --> 14:48.680
Hotel cribs are always so comfy.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.974
I wish I knew where to get
one of these puppies.

14:50.974 --> 14:53.476
Guys, Preston's missing.
We got to find him.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.062
That hooker in the bathroom
was dead when I found her!

15:10.744 --> 15:13.038
Okay, Preston's not answering texts,

15:13.038 --> 15:14.706
and the presentation's in three hours.

15:14.706 --> 15:16.791
We got to retrace our steps.

15:22.547 --> 15:24.716
We've been to every strip joint in town

15:24.716 --> 15:26.301
and can't find Preston anywhere.

15:26.301 --> 15:28.470
We hit Uggoz, with a "Z" at the end.

15:28.470 --> 15:30.472
Jersey Girlz, with a "Z" on the end.

15:30.472 --> 15:32.640
C Sectionz, with a "Z" on the end.

15:32.724 --> 15:35.310
I think we can all agree
that the "Z" on the end

15:35.310 --> 15:37.228
takes sexy to the next level.

15:37.312 --> 15:39.773
And when the "Z"
is a little tilted on the sign,

15:39.773 --> 15:42.233
ooh-la-la.

15:43.318 --> 15:44.903
Hey, do you remember seeing us last night

15:44.903 --> 15:46.696
with a dignified Black man?

15:46.780 --> 15:49.282
Getting a little tired of you
punching that word.

15:49.366 --> 15:50.825
No, just you four.

15:50.909 --> 15:53.161
But that pilot there
said he'd pay for my college.

15:53.161 --> 15:54.454
That doesn't sound like me.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.955
Two-year community college?

15:56.039 --> 15:58.583
Oh, yeah, that...
yeah, that sounds like me.

16:02.253 --> 16:04.714
I really like working with you, Heather.

16:04.798 --> 16:06.049
Me too, Chris.

16:06.049 --> 16:07.300
By the way,

16:07.384 --> 16:09.552
if you want to go
in for a real kiss today,

16:09.636 --> 16:11.262
I won't stop you.

16:11.346 --> 16:12.555
Places, everyone.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.391
And I want to see acting today.

16:14.391 --> 16:16.184
No more amateur hour.

16:18.520 --> 16:19.979
Oh, Romeo.
I don't believe you.

16:20.063 --> 16:21.481
- Again.
- Oh, Romeo.

16:21.481 --> 16:22.816
- Bring it down.
- Oh, Romeo.

16:22.816 --> 16:24.275
- Bring it up.
- Oh, Romeo!

16:24.359 --> 16:26.361
Can we get a sip of water for our actress?

16:26.361 --> 16:29.030
She's sounding a little...
"smacky."

16:29.114 --> 16:30.615
That's it! I quit!

16:30.699 --> 16:32.784
I am too pretty and rich
to put up with this.

16:33.785 --> 16:35.453
She is rich. Her dad owns a bunch of

16:35.537 --> 16:36.663
Ruth's Chris Steak Houses.

16:36.663 --> 16:39.332
Stewie, you ruined everything.

16:39.416 --> 16:42.752
I was finally
going to kiss a beautiful, nice girl.

16:42.836 --> 16:45.630
She had my heart and I had hers.

16:45.714 --> 16:48.800
Why must dark forces conspire

16:48.800 --> 16:51.678
to extinguish love's light?

16:55.348 --> 16:58.226
Everyone, we finally have our Romeo.

17:01.855 --> 17:03.481
Thanks, Stewie.

17:03.565 --> 17:05.275
But what about Juliet?

17:05.275 --> 17:06.693
Don't you worry.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.945
Ruth's Chris's Stewie Griffin's
Principal Shepherd's

17:09.029 --> 17:10.530
Baz Luhrmann's <i>William Shakespeare's</i>

17:10.530 --> 17:12.866
<i>Romeo and Juliet...</i>

17:12.866 --> 17:15.618
- What was the question?
- I-I don't remember.

17:21.166 --> 17:23.168
Hello, I lost my boss,

17:23.168 --> 17:25.378
so I'll be your
substitute presenter today.

17:25.462 --> 17:28.048
But, uh, no watching <i>Ratatouille.</i>

17:28.048 --> 17:29.591
We don't get that joke

17:29.591 --> 17:31.426
which references something from earlier.

17:33.553 --> 17:36.222
"The Importance
of Pawtucket Patriot Ale Products

17:36.306 --> 17:38.683
"in Relation to the Greater
New Jersey Market,

17:38.767 --> 17:40.852
as Prepared by Preston Lloyd."

17:46.274 --> 17:47.525
<i>I've already lost 'em.</i>

17:47.609 --> 17:48.693
<i>What can I do?</i>

17:48.777 --> 17:50.403
<i>I need a beer.</i>

17:51.821 --> 17:53.782
Ah... much better.

17:53.782 --> 17:55.950
Wait a minute. That's it!

17:56.034 --> 17:58.161
Look, you're not gonna understand beer

17:58.161 --> 17:59.829
with numbers or PowerPoints.

17:59.913 --> 18:01.998
Beer is good
because it makes you feel better

18:02.082 --> 18:04.793
and do awesome things
you wouldn't normally do.

18:04.793 --> 18:07.379
Beer makes memories that will last...

18:07.379 --> 18:08.880
until you black out.

18:08.880 --> 18:12.258
And when you forget, there are no regrets.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.179
Beer is courage--

18:16.179 --> 18:19.432
the courage to moon people
from a not-moving car.

18:19.516 --> 18:21.851
Beer helps you achieve new heights,

18:21.935 --> 18:24.187
atop the shoulders of unwilling strangers

18:24.187 --> 18:25.522
in a chicken fight.

18:25.522 --> 18:27.857
Beer makes you grab the brass ring,

18:27.941 --> 18:29.859
or the taser of a casino security guy.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.071
But if you won't listen to me,

18:33.071 --> 18:35.949
listen to Supreme Court Justice
Brett Kavanaugh.

18:35.949 --> 18:38.576
I liked beer. Still like beer.

18:38.660 --> 18:41.621
Beer is great because life is hard.

18:41.705 --> 18:44.040
Don't make it harder with seltzer.

18:46.126 --> 18:48.253
Oh, my God. You're cheering me.

18:48.253 --> 18:49.921
No, we just saw a picture of Bon Jovi

18:50.005 --> 18:51.256
on the wall behind you.

18:51.256 --> 18:52.841
But you still won us over.

18:52.841 --> 18:54.342
Pawtucket Patriot Ale will stay

18:54.426 --> 18:56.678
the choice of New Jersey alcoholics.

19:06.354 --> 19:08.023
Preston! You're alive!

19:08.023 --> 19:10.692
Yes. And thanks to you, so is our company.

19:10.692 --> 19:12.277
But how are you even standing?

19:12.277 --> 19:15.447
Peter, I had one sip, found it disgusting,

19:15.447 --> 19:17.323
then watched you get totally annihilated

19:17.407 --> 19:18.867
in three minutes flat.

19:18.867 --> 19:21.995
I realized only a true drunk
could save the brewery.

19:21.995 --> 19:24.122
That's why I sent you
that text last night.

19:24.122 --> 19:25.665
I spent the morning enjoying

19:25.749 --> 19:27.542
all four Monopoly railroad properties.

19:27.542 --> 19:28.918
I love trains.

19:29.002 --> 19:30.295
I'm on the spectrum.

19:30.295 --> 19:31.880
Why didn't you respond to texts?

19:31.880 --> 19:34.299
Looking at trains. Love trains.

19:34.299 --> 19:36.509
I also love watching an employee go

19:36.593 --> 19:39.888
from least productive to...
well, kind of productive.

19:41.931 --> 19:44.142
Thanks for believing in me, Preston.

19:44.142 --> 19:45.894
Hey, you want to go down to the pier

19:45.894 --> 19:47.604
and watch the bodies float in?

19:47.604 --> 19:48.980
I'd like that.

19:53.068 --> 19:54.819
Ooh, there's one.

19:54.903 --> 19:57.447
Oh, that bird is going to town on him.

19:57.447 --> 19:59.657
Oh, there's another one
with no hands and no feet.

19:59.741 --> 20:01.117
What do you think it is, Russians?

20:01.201 --> 20:02.660
Always the Russians.

20:02.744 --> 20:05.121
How come the bodies are all so fat?

20:05.205 --> 20:06.915
They're full of water, Peter.

20:06.915 --> 20:08.541
Is that why I'm so big?

20:08.625 --> 20:09.959
On account of the water?

20:10.043 --> 20:12.462
No, Peter. You are aggressively obese.

20:12.462 --> 20:14.255
You have no self-control.

20:14.339 --> 20:15.548
If you don't change your ways,

20:15.632 --> 20:17.509
you are going to die prematurely.

20:19.928 --> 20:21.429
Oh, look, a lady!

20:21.513 --> 20:24.641
Yes, Peter. A lady.

20:32.774 --> 20:34.192
Here's to my love.

20:35.318 --> 20:37.696
Oh, true apothecary,

20:37.696 --> 20:39.406
thy drugs are quick.

20:39.406 --> 20:42.242
Thus, with a kiss...

20:42.242 --> 20:45.203
I die.

20:47.372 --> 20:49.416
Oh, no, Romeo's dead.

20:49.416 --> 20:51.668
Now he can't enjoy
Ruth's Chris Steak House's

20:51.668 --> 20:53.795
Surf-and-Turf Two-for-One Fridays.

20:57.716 --> 20:59.426
He did it.

20:59.426 --> 21:01.886
The son of a bitch did it.

21:34.002 --> 21:35.962
