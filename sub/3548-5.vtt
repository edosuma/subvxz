WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:04.775
GABRIELLE TRIED TO REKINDLE
AN OLD AFFAIR.

00:04.775 --> 00:06.677
GABY, I'M GETTING MARRIED.

00:06.677 --> 00:09.110
AND I WAS MARRIED
WHEN WE GOT TOGETHER.

00:09.110 --> 00:11.582
THAT IS NOT HOW
I'M GONNA BE MARRIED.

00:11.582 --> 00:14.145
LYNETTE GOT THE SUPPORT
SHE NEEDED FOR CHEMOTHERAPY.

00:14.145 --> 00:18.018
KATHERINE, WHO LIKED
EVERYTHING IN ITS PLACE...
 OOH!

00:18.018 --> 00:20.621
THOUGHT THAT HER HUSBAND
WAS FORGETTING HIS.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.593
OH, I GUESS YOU LEARNED
NOTHING FROM CHICAGO.

00:22.593 --> 00:24.125
BREE'S ATTEMPT TO KEEP

00:24.125 --> 00:26.026
HER DAUGHTER'S PREGNANCY
A SECRET...

00:26.026 --> 00:28.099
YOU ARE KEEPING
MY GRANDCHILDREN FROM ME.

00:28.099 --> 00:31.432
EVOKED AN UNEXPECTED RESPONSE.

00:31.432 --> 00:33.764
WE'RE LIFE PARTNERS.

00:33.764 --> 00:36.137
AND SUSAN TRIED TO CONNECT
WITH THE NEWEST NEIGHBORS.

00:36.137 --> 00:39.070
YEAH, I'VE SEEN A LOT OF CABLE,
SO I GET IT.

00:39.070 --> 00:41.372
I HOPE WE CAN LIVE UP
TO YOUR STEREOTYPE.

00:41.372 --> 00:42.813
I SHOULD GO.

00:45.216 --> 00:47.218
(Mary Alice)
THE ODD-LOOKING BOXES

00:47.218 --> 00:50.221
WERE DELIVERED TO THE HOME
OF BOB HUNTER AND LEE McDERMOTT

00:50.221 --> 00:53.124
EARLY ON A TUESDAY MORNING.

00:53.124 --> 00:55.826
IT WASN'T LONG
BEFORE WORKMEN HAD OPENED THEM

00:55.826 --> 01:00.231
AND BEGUN ASSEMBLING
THE VARIOUS PARTS AND PIECES.

01:00.231 --> 01:03.394
HAPPILY,
IT ONLY TOOK THREE HOURS

01:03.394 --> 01:07.498
TO TURN THE CONTENTS
INTO A FINISHED WORK OF ART.

01:09.069 --> 01:12.173
SADLY,
IT ONLY TOOK 15 MINUTES

01:12.173 --> 01:14.775
FOR THE RESIDENTS
OF WISTERIA LANE...

01:14.775 --> 01:16.777
WHAT THE HELL IS IT?

01:16.777 --> 01:19.250
TO BECOME ART CRITICS.

01:19.250 --> 01:22.183
I THINK IT'S A SCULPTURE.
 I THINK IT'S CRAP.

01:22.183 --> 01:24.685
OF ALL THE GAY MEN
IN THE WORLD,

01:24.685 --> 01:28.119
WE HAVE TO GET THE TWO
WITHOUT TASTE.
 WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
ABOUT THIS?

01:28.119 --> 01:31.122
I SAY WE KEEP SMILING
AND LOOK FOR THE HIDDEN CAMERAS.

01:31.122 --> 01:33.194
I THINK WE'RE ABOUT
TO GET PUNK'D.

01:33.194 --> 01:36.267
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING
WECANDO. IT'S NOT OUR LAWN.
 IT'S OUR NEIGHBORHOOD,

01:36.267 --> 01:38.429
AND WE HAVE RULES
AGAINST THIS SORT OF THING,

01:38.429 --> 01:40.601
OR AT LEAST WE DID
WHEN I USED TO LIVE HERE.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.133
WHO'S RUNNING
THE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION?

01:42.133 --> 01:44.675
WELL, IT WAS MARY ALICE,
BUT AS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD...

01:44.675 --> 01:48.108
YES, VERY TRAGIC. SO WE HAVEN'T
HAD A PRESIDENT IN FOUR YEARS?

01:48.108 --> 01:51.282
NO ONE WOULD VOLUNTEER.
IT'S A PAIN-IN-THE-ASS JOB.

01:51.282 --> 01:52.613
I'LL VOLUNTEER.

01:52.613 --> 01:55.186
WE CAN HOLD AN ELECTION
IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.

01:55.186 --> 01:58.189
I CAN GET RID OF THIS TINFOIL
ATROCITY BY THE WEEKEND.

01:58.189 --> 02:00.191
OKAY, BEFORE WE BECOME
AN UGLY MOB,

02:00.191 --> 02:02.493
WHY DOESN'T ONE OF US
GO TALK TO THE GUYS?

02:02.493 --> 02:04.155
BUT NOT ME.
THEY HATE ME.

02:04.155 --> 02:06.797
BREE, YOU TALK TO THEM.
YOU CAN RELATE TO THEM.

02:06.797 --> 02:08.299
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

02:08.299 --> 02:11.302
YOU GOT A KID WHO CAME
FLYING OUT OF THE CLOSET

02:11.302 --> 02:14.405
AND A HUSBAND WHO'S BEEN
LOOKING FOR THE DOORKNOB.

02:14.405 --> 02:16.707
WHAT? YOU'VE MET HIM.

02:16.707 --> 02:19.210
OOH! THEY'RE COMING.

02:21.612 --> 02:23.143
GOOD MORNING, LADIES.

02:23.143 --> 02:27.278
HI. UH, WE WERE JUST TALKING
ABOUT YOUR SCULPTURE.

02:27.278 --> 02:29.280
THAT'S WHAT
I LOVE ABOUT ART--

02:29.280 --> 02:32.583
THE WAY
IT PROVOKES DISCUSSION.
 ALTHOUGH IT WOULD'VE BEEN NICE

02:32.583 --> 02:35.726
IF YOU HAD DISCUSSED IT
WITH US.
 WHAT, YOU DON'T--
YOU DON'T LIKE IT?

02:35.726 --> 02:37.788
WELL,
WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT.

02:37.788 --> 02:40.261
IT'S JUST A LITTLE,
UH...

02:40.261 --> 02:42.333
IT'S AN EYESORE.

02:42.333 --> 02:43.764
REALLY?
 MM-HMM.

02:43.764 --> 02:46.297
YOU HEAR THAT, BOB?
WE FLEW TO FINLAND

02:46.297 --> 02:48.639
AND PAID $24,000
TO COMMISSION AN EYESORE.

02:48.639 --> 02:50.941
I DON'T MIND IT.

02:50.941 --> 02:53.944
NOT TO BRAG,
BUT I WENT TO ART SCHOOL.
 COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

02:53.944 --> 02:57.678
AND THEY TAUGHT US
THAT ART IS SUBJECTIVE.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.450
THANK YOU, SUSAN.

02:59.450 --> 03:02.353
SUSAN'S NEED
FOR APPROVAL ASIDE,

03:02.353 --> 03:05.316
THIS CLEARLY IS NOT APPROPRIATE
FOR THE STREET.

03:05.316 --> 03:08.389
WISTERIA LANE
HAS A... TRADITIONAL LOOK.

03:08.389 --> 03:10.391
WELL,
MAYBE YOU'D LIKE IT BETTER

03:10.391 --> 03:13.193
IF WE COVERED IT
WITH A GINGHAM THROW.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.796
LADIES, UH, I'M SORRY.

03:15.796 --> 03:18.769
WE HONESTLY THOUGHT
THAT PEOPLE WOULD LIKE IT,

03:18.769 --> 03:21.932
BUT EVEN IF YOU DISAPPROVE,
WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL RESPECT

03:21.932 --> 03:26.437
OUR RIGHT TO DECORATE
AS WE SEE FIT.

03:28.879 --> 03:31.211
HAVE A NICE DAY, PHILISTINES.

03:31.211 --> 03:36.216
YES, ART CAME TO WISTERIA LANE
ON A TUESDAY MORNING,

03:36.216 --> 03:37.918
AND BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON...

03:37.918 --> 03:42.253
I THINK IT'S TIME TO RECONVENE
THE HOMEOWNERS' ASSOCIATION.

03:42.253 --> 03:44.325
ALL IN FAVOR?

03:44.325 --> 03:46.397
(all) AYE.

03:46.397 --> 03:57.968
WAR HAD COME AS WELL.

03:57.968 --> 04:01.342
AS WORD OF THE SCULPTURE
SPREAD,

04:01.342 --> 04:03.344
BOB AND LEE BEGAN TO WONDER

04:03.344 --> 04:06.717
IF ANY OF THEIR NEIGHBORS
WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE.

04:06.717 --> 04:09.280
BUT WHEN THE SCULPTURE'S
TRUE FUNCTION

04:09.280 --> 04:11.622
WAS UNVEILED THE NEXT DAY,

04:11.622 --> 04:14.985
WHATEVER SUPPORT
THEY DID HAVE...

04:17.327 --> 04:18.829
(water whooshing in distance)

04:18.829 --> 04:20.761
WAS QUICKLY WASHED AWAY.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.733
COME ON.

04:22.733 --> 04:24.735
IT'S 6:00 A.M.
WHAT IS THAT?

04:24.735 --> 04:27.398
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT MAKE IT STOP.

04:27.398 --> 04:30.641
(sighs) OH.

04:33.504 --> 04:35.946
OH, MY GOD.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.456
WOW! IT'S A FOUNTAIN, TOO.

04:45.456 --> 04:47.458
WE WOULD HAVE MENTIONED THAT
YESTERDAY,

04:47.458 --> 04:49.920
BUT YOUR FRIENDS
WERE A LITTLE UPTIGHT.

04:49.920 --> 04:51.922
YEAH,
THEY CAN GET LIKE THAT.

04:51.922 --> 04:55.426
SO DO YOU THINK THAT YOU CAN
JUST TURN IT OFF FOR A SECOND?

04:55.426 --> 04:56.627
(beep)

05:00.300 --> 05:01.432
WHAT'S UP?

05:01.432 --> 05:03.604
I WAS JUST WONDERING, UM,

05:03.604 --> 05:07.438
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
MOVE IT TO YOUR BACKYARD?

05:07.438 --> 05:10.481
WHY?
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED IT.

05:10.481 --> 05:12.483
REMEMBER? YOU SAID,
"ART IS SUBJECTIVE."

05:12.483 --> 05:14.885
YES.QUIETART IS SUBJECTIVE,

05:14.885 --> 05:17.948
BUT YOU SEE, MIKE IS WORKING
REALLY LONG HOURS LATELY,

05:17.948 --> 05:20.351
AND HE CAN'T SLEEP
WITH ALL THAT NOISE.

05:20.351 --> 05:23.354
WE'RE NOT GONNA TURN IT OFF
BECAUSE WE NEED IT TO DROWN OUT

05:23.354 --> 05:26.657
ALL THE STUFF WE HEAR
COMING FROM YOUR HOUSE.
 LIKE WHAT?

05:26.657 --> 05:28.459
LET'S SEE. YOU YAKKING
TO YOUR MOM ON THE PHONE.

05:28.459 --> 05:30.361
YOU GRUNTING
THROUGH YOUR PILATES DVDs.

05:30.361 --> 05:33.333
YOU IN THE SHOWER, BUTCHERING
THE SCORE TO "BRIGADOON."

05:33.333 --> 05:35.836
I HAVE A LOVELY VOICE.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.539
WHOEVER TOLD YOU THAT
IS NOT YOUR FRIEND.

05:38.539 --> 05:42.373
HE'S A LITTLE CRANKY. I THINK
SOMEONE NEEDS HIS FRENCH TOAST.

05:42.373 --> 05:43.974
COME ON, LEE.

05:43.974 --> 05:46.477
NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO, WE'RE NOT DONE HERE.

05:46.477 --> 05:49.480
AS YOUR NEIGHBOR,
I HAVE A RIGHT TO BE HEARD...
 (beep)

05:49.480 --> 05:51.482
AND I SAY
THAT SIMPLE HUMAN DECENCY

05:51.482 --> 05:54.024
DICTATES THAT YOU TURN OFF
THAT FOUNTAINRIGHT NOW!

05:54.024 --> 05:57.357
(groans)

05:57.357 --> 05:58.989
HEY, GUYS.

05:58.989 --> 06:00.491
(Porter) DO OVER, PARKER.

06:00.491 --> 06:02.563
HEY, GUYS, I GOT YOUR SNACK.

06:02.563 --> 06:04.435
WHAT YOU PLAYING?

06:04.435 --> 06:05.696
ACTION FIGURES.
WANNA PLAY, MOM?

06:05.696 --> 06:08.939
SHE DOES
 AWESOMEALIEN VOICES.

06:08.939 --> 06:11.742
(alien voice)
THANKS, SWEETHEART.

06:11.742 --> 06:13.974
(laughs)

06:13.974 --> 06:15.776
(cell phone rings)

06:15.776 --> 06:17.578
(beep)
 HELLO?

06:17.578 --> 06:20.110
OH, YEAH. HI, DR. SHILLER.

06:20.110 --> 06:23.454
OKAY,
THAT'S MY WHITE BLOOD COUNT.

06:23.454 --> 06:25.986
UH-HUH, BUT AS LONG
AS IT'S HIGHER THAN 4.0,

06:25.986 --> 06:27.988
THAT MEANS
I DON'T HAVE NEUTROPENIA, RIGHT?

06:27.988 --> 06:30.090
WELL, THAT'S GREAT. (chuckles)

06:30.090 --> 06:31.662
THANKS FOR CALLING.

06:31.662 --> 06:36.166
YEAH, YOU, TOO. BYE.
 (beep)

06:37.728 --> 06:39.069
WHAT?

06:39.069 --> 06:41.772
YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT DOCTORS
UP HERE.

06:41.772 --> 06:43.574
OR ABOUT BEING SICK.

06:43.574 --> 06:46.937
IF YOU DO, YOU HAVE TO GO.
THAT'S THE RULE.

06:46.937 --> 06:48.909
WELL...

06:48.909 --> 06:51.642
THAT'S A GOOD RULE.

06:51.642 --> 06:54.184
ALTHOUGH IT WASN'T BAD NEWS.
IT WAS ACTUALLY--

06:54.184 --> 06:57.948
DOESN'T MATTER.
WE VOTED. IT'S A RULE.

06:57.948 --> 06:59.450
GOT IT.

06:59.450 --> 07:02.593
SICK TALK DONE, OKAY?

07:02.593 --> 07:05.456
YOU GUYS HAVE FUN.

07:05.456 --> 07:06.757
(Parker) FREEZE POWER.

07:06.757 --> 07:09.760
(Porter) DO OVER, PARKER. THAT
GUY DOESN'T HAVE FREEZING POWER.

07:09.760 --> 07:12.703
IF HIS GUY CAN FLY,
MY GUY CAN FREEZE.

07:12.703 --> 07:14.204
(makes whooshing sounds)

07:14.204 --> 07:17.538
HI. IT'S, UH, MRS. HODGE. MAY I
PLEASE SPEAK WITH DANIELLE?

07:17.538 --> 07:19.039
MMM. MUFFINS.
 T--

07:19.039 --> 07:22.112
HANDS OFF. WE'RE BRINGING THESE
TO DANIELLE FOR HER BIRTHDAY.

07:22.112 --> 07:24.915
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
SHE'S GONE?

07:24.915 --> 07:27.518
AND YOU BELIEVED HER?

07:27.518 --> 07:28.819
YOU IDIOT!

07:28.819 --> 07:31.622
I SHOULD SUE YOUR
IRRESPONSIBLE ASS OFF FOR THIS.

07:31.622 --> 07:34.685
YEAH, WELL, GOOD DAY TO YOU,
TOO, REVEREND MOTHER!
 (beep)

07:34.685 --> 07:36.827
WHAT HAPPENED?
 THOSE STUPID NUNS
AT THE CONVENT

07:36.827 --> 07:38.829
LET DANIELLE'S GRANDMOTHER
KIDNAP HER.

07:38.829 --> 07:41.732
SHE CLAIMED I'D GIVEN HER
PERMISSION FOR A WEEKEND VISIT.
 (beeping)

07:43.063 --> 07:45.065
(singsong voice)
PHYLLIS! IT'S ME.

07:45.065 --> 07:48.068
(normal voice) YOU CAN SCREEN
YOUR CALLS ALL YOU WANT TO,

07:48.068 --> 07:51.041
BUT TRUST ME, OLD WOMAN,
YOU ARE IN A WORLD OF TROUBLE.

07:51.041 --> 07:53.544
I know where you live,
and I am coming for you.

07:53.544 --> 07:55.075
(line clicks, beep)
 SHOULDN'T WE BE WORRIED?

07:55.075 --> 07:57.077
NO,
I THINK WE'RE READY FOR HER.
 (video game playing)

07:57.077 --> 07:59.680
NOW SHOW ME AGAIN
HOW YOU KILL THE ZOMBIES.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.011
(creature roars)

08:01.011 --> 08:03.053
OH.
 (laser gunshots)

08:03.053 --> 08:06.086
WHY CAN'T I GO? I PLAY GOLF.

08:07.588 --> 08:10.761
AND I'D LOVE TO MEET
YOUR... COLLEGE BUDDIES.

08:10.761 --> 08:14.725
EDIE, ME AND THE GUYS HAVE ONLY
TWO RULES FOR THESE WEEKENDS--

08:14.725 --> 08:17.127
NO PLAID PANTS
AND NO WOMEN.

08:17.127 --> 08:20.230
FINE. BE THAT WAY.

08:20.230 --> 08:23.634
AND TO THINK,
I GOT YOU A GIFT.

08:27.938 --> 08:30.240
HEY, GOLF BALLS.

08:30.240 --> 08:31.582
THEY'RE MONOGRAMMED.

08:31.582 --> 08:34.815
WAIT.
THESE ARE YOUR INITIALS.

08:34.815 --> 08:37.517
EXACTLY. WHILE YOU'RE
OUT THERE PLAYING,

08:37.517 --> 08:43.253
I WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW
 WHOYOUR BALLS BELONG TO.

08:46.526 --> 08:49.529
(lawn mower whirring)

08:51.562 --> 08:54.565
GOOD WORK, BOYS, BUT I HAVE
TO HEAD OUT IN A FEW MINUTES,

08:54.565 --> 08:58.639
SO MAKE SURE YOU PUT ALL
THE STUFF BACK IN THE GARAGE.
 (cell phone rings)

08:58.639 --> 08:59.740
HELLO?

08:59.740 --> 09:01.672
(Carlos) Hey, on my way.

09:01.672 --> 09:03.814
MEET YOU AT THE HOTEL, OKAY?

09:03.814 --> 09:06.617
I'M LEAVING IN FIVE MINUTES.

09:11.321 --> 09:13.553
(boy speaks indistinctly)

09:13.553 --> 09:15.886
UH, BRETT,
COULD YOU COME HERE A SECOND?

09:18.659 --> 09:21.662
HOW LONG HAS THAT VAN
BEEN PARKED OVER THERE?
 COUPLE HOURS.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.994
HOURS? ARE YOU SERIOUS?

09:23.994 --> 09:28.999
OH, MY GOD.
 I THINK HE'S JUST WAITING
FOR SOMEONE TO COME HOME.

09:28.999 --> 09:33.674
BRETT, WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
A CABLE GUY WAITED FOR ANYONE?

09:33.674 --> 09:37.107
I SEE A LOT OF LAWN MOWING
IN YOUR FUTURE.

09:37.107 --> 09:39.850
HEY, IT'S ME AGAIN.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE THIS.

09:39.850 --> 09:41.852
BEFORE VICTOR LEFT
ON HIS BUSINESS TRIP,

09:41.852 --> 09:43.884
HE HIRED SOMEONE TO TAIL ME.

09:43.884 --> 09:46.657
OH, MAN.
SHOULD WE CALL THIS OFF?
 No way.

09:46.657 --> 09:48.959
IT'S GONNA TAKE MORE THAN
A GUY WITH MINI BINOCULARS

09:48.959 --> 09:51.962
AND A BAG OF DOUGHNUTS
TO KEEP ME UNDER LOCK AND KEY.

09:51.962 --> 09:54.324
I'LL BE THERE
AS SOON AS I CAN.
 (beep)

10:01.802 --> 10:04.775
BOYS, TIME TO GET PAID.

10:04.775 --> 10:06.637
(all shouting indistinctly)

10:06.637 --> 10:08.639
(boy) COME ON, EDDIE!

10:16.687 --> 10:18.318
(boys shouting indistinctly)

10:18.318 --> 10:21.621
(boy) BYE, MRS. LANG.
SEE YOU NEXT TIME.

10:22.853 --> 10:25.826
(boy) COME BACK HERE!

10:25.826 --> 10:27.828
(boy) ARE YOU TAKING
THE BUS HOME?

10:27.828 --> 10:31.732
(boys continue
shouting indistinctly)

10:31.732 --> 10:33.734
AS SOON AS WE GET
AROUND THE CORNER,

10:33.734 --> 10:36.667
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO ADJUST
THIS HORN.

10:51.782 --> 10:54.084
GABRIELLE.

10:54.084 --> 10:55.425
HEY.

10:55.425 --> 10:57.828
H-HI.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.762
LOOK AT YOU. WHAT A SURPRISE.

11:01.762 --> 11:05.996
(John) OH, UH, THIS IS GABY.
THIS IS MY WIFE TAMMY.

11:05.996 --> 11:08.368
TAMMY, THIS IS GABRIELLE.

11:08.368 --> 11:11.301
WOW, LOOK AT YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS.

11:11.301 --> 11:14.705
THANKS.
IT WASN'T PLANNED.

11:14.705 --> 11:19.850
OKAY. SO... ARE YOU GUYS
STAYING HERE?

11:19.850 --> 11:21.852
NO, WE JUST CAME
FOR SOME LUNCH.

11:21.852 --> 11:23.313
DADDY OWNS THIS PLACE.

11:23.313 --> 11:25.716
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU'RE A HOTEL HEIRESS.

11:25.716 --> 11:28.759
YEAH, BUT NOT
ONE OF THE SKANKY ONES.

11:28.759 --> 11:31.391
HOW DO YOU TWO
KNOW EACH OTHER?

11:31.391 --> 11:33.794
I USED TO BE
GABRIELLE'S GARDENER.

11:33.794 --> 11:36.867
OH!
WELL, AS YOU CAN SEE,

11:36.867 --> 11:38.869
HE'S CERTAINLY MARRIED UP
FROM LAWN BOY.

11:38.869 --> 11:40.731
TAMMY.
 WHAT?

11:40.731 --> 11:43.473
FORGET IT.

11:43.473 --> 11:45.736
SO I HEARD
YOU MARRIED THE MAYOR.

11:45.736 --> 11:47.738
YOU'RE MARRIED
TO VICTOR LANG?

11:47.738 --> 11:49.880
HE AND DADDY
GO HUNTING TOGETHER.

11:49.880 --> 11:52.242
I TOLD JOHN IF HE WOULD
JUST BE NICER TO DADDY,

11:52.242 --> 11:54.815
HE COULD HANG OUT
WITH PEOPLE LIKE THE MAYOR

11:54.815 --> 11:56.116
AND MAKE IMPORTANT CONTACTS.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.448
AND I KEEP TELLING YOU
THAT I DON'T NEED

11:58.448 --> 12:01.091
TO KISS YOUR FATHER'S ASS
TO HAVE A CAREER.

12:01.091 --> 12:03.924
UH, YEAH,
SO I MARRIED THE MAYOR.

12:03.924 --> 12:05.926
KOOKY, HUH?

12:05.926 --> 12:08.158
SO, UM,
IS HE HERE WITH YOU?

12:08.158 --> 12:11.832
UH, NO. HE'S AWAY
AT A CONFERENCE,

12:11.832 --> 12:15.165
SO I DECIDED TO TREAT MYSELF
TO A SPA WEEKEND. (chuckles)

12:15.165 --> 12:18.138
OOH! YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY
GET THE FULL BODY MASSAGE.

12:18.138 --> 12:19.770
(mouths words)

12:19.770 --> 12:22.913
OH, I PLAN TO.
(chuckles nervously)

12:22.913 --> 12:24.875
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

12:24.875 --> 12:26.216
YOU, TOO, GABY.

12:28.518 --> 12:30.520
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
A COMPLETE SHOCK.

12:30.520 --> 12:32.783
I MEAN,
OF ALL PEOPLE TO RUN INTO.

12:32.783 --> 12:36.186
WHO WERE THEY?

12:36.186 --> 12:39.830
JUST AN OLD FRIEND
AND HIS IDIOT WIFE.

12:39.830 --> 12:41.361
COME ON. LET'S GO.

12:43.834 --> 12:48.138
BREE,
HOW LOVELY TO SEE YOU.

12:48.138 --> 12:50.500
CRAM IT, PHYLLIS.
 YOU GOT A LOT OF NERVE

12:50.500 --> 12:53.443
STEALING DANIELLE
FROM A CONVENT WE PREPAID FOR.

12:53.443 --> 12:55.245
SHE DIDN'T STEAL ME.

12:55.245 --> 12:58.508
I'M A MATURE PERSON CAPABLE
OF MAKING MY OWN DECISIONS.

12:58.508 --> 13:00.510
WELL, GOOD.
YOU CAN DECIDE TO PACK,

13:00.510 --> 13:02.382
BECAUSE WE ARE TAKING YOU
BACK TO THE CONVENT.

13:02.382 --> 13:04.384
MNH-MNH.
I'M TURNING 18 THIS WEEKEND,

13:04.384 --> 13:06.386
SO YOU CAN'T BOSS ME AROUND
ANYMORE.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.288
I'M STAYING WITH GRANDMA,

13:08.288 --> 13:11.291
AND I'M GONNA HAVE MY BABY
DELIVERED HERE.
 WE HAVE
AN EXCELLENT MEDICAL STAFF.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.792
IT'S A RETIREMENT VILLAGE.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.365
ALL THESE DOCTORS KNOW
HOW TO DELIVER IS BAD NEWS.

13:15.365 --> 13:17.367
I DON'T CARE. I'M STAYING,

13:17.367 --> 13:20.831
AND I'M GONNA RAISE THE BABY
HERE, TOO.
 WHAT?

13:20.831 --> 13:22.232
ENTIRELY HER IDEA.

13:22.232 --> 13:24.504
A BABY
IS GOD'S MOST PRECIOUS GIFT.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.506
I WILL NOT HAVE MINE RAISED

13:26.506 --> 13:28.979
BY A COLD, EMOTIONALLY
UNAVAILABLE WOMAN LIKE YOU.

13:28.979 --> 13:30.540
"EMOTIONALLY UNAVAILABLE."

13:30.540 --> 13:33.884
GOSH, I WONDER WHERE SHE
PICKED UP THAT LITTLE PHRASE.
 HMM.

13:33.884 --> 13:36.516
LIKE I'M TOO DUMB
TO THINK OF IT MYSELF?

13:36.516 --> 13:40.120
YOU'RE ALWAYS MEAN TO ME,
JUST LIKE YOU WERE TO DAD.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.852
YOU EMASCULATED HIM.

13:41.852 --> 13:44.124
WELL, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
EMASCULATE ME.

13:44.124 --> 13:46.126
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS,

13:46.126 --> 13:47.998
YOU PETULANT SOCK PUPPET!

13:47.998 --> 13:50.961
WHO CARES?

13:50.961 --> 13:52.532
I'M GOING TO THE STORE.

13:54.935 --> 13:57.107
BUY A DICTIONARY.

13:57.107 --> 13:58.108
(door slams)

13:58.108 --> 14:02.042
SO THAT'S ALL SETTLED.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.975
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME ICED TEA?

14:13.954 --> 14:16.086
YOU AREN'T JOINING
THE LYNCH MOB?

14:16.086 --> 14:18.088
UH, YOU MEAN KATHERINE'S
HOMEOWNERS THING?

14:18.088 --> 14:20.230
YEAH, I THINK
I'LL SIT THIS ONE OUT.

14:20.230 --> 14:22.933
NO, NO, NO. YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
YOU'VE GOT TO PICK A SIDE.

14:22.933 --> 14:26.436
ART OR MINDLESS CONFORMITY?

14:26.436 --> 14:28.899
SEE, THIS IS ONE OF
THE UPSIDES OF HAVING CANCER.

14:28.899 --> 14:31.902
YOU GET TO EXCUSE YOURSELF FROM
PETTY NEIGHBORHOOD SQUABBLES.

14:31.902 --> 14:34.945
YOU WON'T THINK THEY'RE SO PETTY
WHEN SHE COMES AFTER YOU.

14:34.945 --> 14:37.277
ME? WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?

14:37.277 --> 14:40.010
DID THE HOMEOWNERS' ASSOCIATION
APPROVE EVERYTHING IN YOUR YARD?

14:40.010 --> 14:42.552
THE FENCE? THAT SWING?

14:42.552 --> 14:44.054
THE TREE HOUSE?

14:44.054 --> 14:46.486
I DON'T THINK KATHERINE
WILL BOTHER HERSELF

14:46.486 --> 14:48.018
OVER A TREE HOUSE.

14:48.018 --> 14:50.020
FIRST, THEY CAME
FOR THE FOUNTAINS,

14:50.020 --> 14:53.893
AND I DID NOT SPEAK OUT
BECAUSE I HAD NO FOUNTAIN.
 WHAT?

14:53.893 --> 14:55.895
THEN THEY CAME
FOR THE LAWN GNOMES,

14:55.895 --> 14:59.469
AND I DID NOT SPEAK OUT
BECAUSE I HAD NO GNOME.
 YOU'RE COMPARING KATHERINE
TO A NAZI?

14:59.469 --> 15:01.471
THEN THEY CAME
FOR MY TREE HOUSE,

15:01.471 --> 15:05.075
AND THERE WAS NO ONE LEFT
TO SPEAK OUT FOR ME.

15:08.538 --> 15:11.041
THANK YOU, LADIES.
I SO APPRECIATE YOUR INPUT,

15:11.041 --> 15:13.944
AND I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE

15:13.944 --> 15:16.916
THAT THE FOUNTAIN HAS NO PLACE
ON OUR STREET.

15:16.916 --> 15:21.491
YEAH, WE GOTTA SHOW THOSE GAYS
WE MEAN BUSINESS.

15:21.491 --> 15:25.455
IDA, AGAIN, THE ISSUE IS NOT
BOB AND LEE BEING GAY.

15:25.455 --> 15:27.097
IT'S THE FOUNTAIN.

15:27.097 --> 15:30.160
WELL, CAN'T IT BE BOTH?

15:30.160 --> 15:33.033
ANYWAY...

15:33.033 --> 15:36.106
IF YOU ELECT ME PRESIDENT,
MY FIRST ACT

15:36.106 --> 15:40.040
WILL BE TO ELIMINATE
THIS SO-CALLED WORK OF ART.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.412
HEAR, HEAR. (chuckles)

15:42.412 --> 15:44.014
YES, LYNETTE.

15:44.014 --> 15:46.516
AFTER YOU GET RID OF
THIS FOUNTAIN, THAT'S IT, RIGHT?

15:46.516 --> 15:49.049
I DON'T FOLLOW.

15:49.049 --> 15:51.051
I MEAN...
YOU'RE NOT GONNA START

15:51.051 --> 15:53.483
CHECKING EVERYONE'S YARDS
FOR THINGS THAT DON'T FIT IN?

15:53.483 --> 15:56.126
(laughs) OH, OF COURSE NOT.

15:56.126 --> 15:59.059
AS LONG AS THOSE THINGS MEET
THE ASSOCIATION'S GUIDELINES.

15:59.059 --> 16:02.032
UH-HUH.
AND WHAT IF THEY DON'T?

16:02.032 --> 16:05.095
ARE YOU REFERRING
TO SOMETHING IN PARTICULAR?

16:05.095 --> 16:08.268
MY KIDS' TREE HOUSE. CAN YOU
PROMISE YOU'LL LEAVE IT ALONE?

16:08.268 --> 16:11.241
WELL, IT'S NOT UP TO ME.
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT.

16:11.241 --> 16:12.742
THERE ARE RULES.

16:12.742 --> 16:14.674
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A NO.

16:14.674 --> 16:17.007
IF I MAKE AN EXCEPTION FOR YOU,

16:17.007 --> 16:19.009
THEN I HAVE TO MAKE ONE
FOR EVERYONE,

16:19.009 --> 16:21.311
AND SURELY, YOU REALIZE
THAT THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD

16:21.311 --> 16:25.015
CAN'T REVOLVE
AROUND YOUR LITTLE TREE HOUSE.

16:25.015 --> 16:27.017
NOW SINCE
I AM RUNNING UNOPPOSED,

16:27.017 --> 16:30.020
I JUST NEED SOMEONE
TO SECOND MY NOMINATION.

16:31.621 --> 16:34.324
OH! THANK YOU, LYNETTE.

16:34.324 --> 16:37.497
NO, ACTUALLY,
I'M NOMINATING MYSELF.

16:37.497 --> 16:40.500
I AM NOW RUNNING
FOR PRESIDENT...

16:40.500 --> 16:42.102
AGAINST YOU.

16:45.305 --> 16:48.108
(chuckles)

16:56.046 --> 16:58.718
YOU KNOW, RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT
IN YOUR CONDITION?

16:58.718 --> 17:00.720
I DON'T THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.093
TOM, I DON'T WANT YOUR OPINION,
JUST YOUR VOTE.

17:03.093 --> 17:06.156
(scoffs) IF YOU WANT
TO SAVE THE TREE HOUSE,

17:06.156 --> 17:08.157
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
RUN INSTEAD?

17:08.157 --> 17:10.200
BECAUSE YOU'D NEVER WIN.
BOSSY WOMEN RULE THIS STREET.

17:10.200 --> 17:13.103
YOU KNOW THAT.
 (under breath)
I KNOW ONE RULES MY LIFE.

17:13.103 --> 17:14.704
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T CATCH THAT.

17:14.704 --> 17:17.107
NOTHING.

17:17.107 --> 17:20.039
LOOK, THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT
A TREE HOUSE OR A FOUNTAIN.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.540
THIS IS ABOUT

17:21.540 --> 17:23.542
WHAT KIND OF NEIGHBORHOOD
WE WANT TO LIVE IN.

17:23.542 --> 17:25.545
DO WE GET TO MAKE
OUR OWN CHOICES,

17:25.545 --> 17:28.648
OR DO WE LET THE TASTE POLICE
MAKE THEM FOR US?

17:28.648 --> 17:32.322
AH, NOW I GET IT. THIS ABOUT YOU
WANTING TO TAKE ON KATHERINE.

17:32.322 --> 17:35.555
NO! THIS IS
ABOUT PERSONAL FREEDOM--

17:35.555 --> 17:37.227
SPECIFICALLY,
MY PERSONAL FREEDOM

17:37.227 --> 17:39.359
TO TAKE DOWN
THAT JACKBOOTED HAUSFRAU.

17:39.359 --> 17:42.132
HONEY, IF YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING TO FIGHT,

17:42.132 --> 17:43.633
HOW ABOUT YOUR CANCER?

17:43.633 --> 17:45.635
HEY, A TUMOR IS A TUMOR

17:45.635 --> 17:49.699
WHETHER IT'S IN YOUR BODY
OR LIVING ACROSS THE STREET.

17:52.142 --> 17:54.444
(sighs) I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU BUY THOSE THINGS.

17:54.444 --> 17:56.506
THEY JUST END UP ON THE FLOOR.

17:56.506 --> 18:01.211
BECAUSE I WANT TO FEEL
PRETTY AND FEMININE.

18:01.211 --> 18:02.512
(knock on door)

18:02.512 --> 18:05.255
OOH! MY CHILI CHEESE FRIES!
JUST A SECOND!

18:05.255 --> 18:08.488
GABRIELLE?
IT'S ME--JOHN.

18:08.488 --> 18:12.122
JOHN? JOHN WHO?

18:13.723 --> 18:15.725
UH, OKAY.
YOU KNOW THAT OLD FRIEND

18:15.725 --> 18:17.867
I RAN INTO IN THE LOBBY?

18:17.867 --> 18:20.670
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
JOHN ROWLAND.

18:20.670 --> 18:22.802
MAYBE. I'M NOT SURE.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.834
(knock)
 GABRIELLE?

18:24.834 --> 18:27.837
BUT JUST TO BE SAFE, YOU MAY
WANNA HIDE IN THE CLOSET.

18:27.837 --> 18:30.510
WHAT? I'M NOT HIDING
FROM THAT GUY.
 REALLY?

18:30.510 --> 18:33.213
BECAUSE HIS FATHER-IN-LAW
GOES HUNTING WITH VICTOR--

18:33.213 --> 18:35.215
YOU KNOW,
THE GUY WHO HIRED SOMEONE

18:35.215 --> 18:38.688
TO TAIL US
AND POSSIBLY KILL US?
 (grunts)

18:38.688 --> 18:40.150
OKAY.

18:46.596 --> 18:48.858
JOHN,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

18:48.858 --> 18:51.231
WHEN I RAN INTO YOU
LAST FALL,

18:51.231 --> 18:53.233
YOU WANTED TO START UP
OUR AFFAIR AGAIN,

18:53.233 --> 18:54.534
AND I WASN'T READY.

18:54.534 --> 18:56.766
WELL, I'M READY.

18:56.766 --> 18:59.309
MM! MM.

18:59.309 --> 19:02.272
(Gabrielle laughing nervously)

19:06.676 --> 19:08.378
HEY.

19:08.378 --> 19:11.351
LISTEN, I PROMISED TOM
I WOULDN'T KNOCK MYSELF OUT

19:11.351 --> 19:13.883
CAMPAIGNING
FOR THIS HOMEOWNERS THING,

19:13.883 --> 19:16.286
SO I WAS HOPING
YOU COULD HELP ME--

19:16.286 --> 19:20.159
YOU KNOW, RING SOME BELLS,
TALK ME UP, THAT SORT OF THING?

19:20.159 --> 19:22.632
I WOULD LOVE TO, BUT...

19:22.632 --> 19:24.494
BUT WHAT?

19:24.494 --> 19:26.496
THIS IS AWKWARD.

19:26.496 --> 19:29.199
UH, I TOLD KATHERINE
I'D VOTE FOR HER.

19:29.199 --> 19:31.341
YOU'RE PICKING HER OVER ME?

19:31.341 --> 19:33.643
UH, IT'S NOT LIKE
I'M PRO-KATHERINE.

19:33.643 --> 19:36.546
I'M JUST ANTI-FOUNTAIN.

19:36.546 --> 19:39.709
OH, DON'T GIVE ME THAT LOOK.
I MADE HER A PROMISE.

19:39.709 --> 19:41.751
YES, BUT THAT WAS
BEFORE YOUR BEST FRIEND

19:41.751 --> 19:44.183
THREW HER SCARF IN THE RING.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.184
UH...

19:45.184 --> 19:47.357
OKAY. IF I VOTE FOR YOU,

19:47.357 --> 19:49.659
DO YOU PROMISE
TO GET RID OF THAT FOUNTAIN?

19:49.659 --> 19:52.962
SEE, THAT'S AWKWARD FOR ME.
THIS IS ABOUT PERSONAL FREEDOM.

19:52.962 --> 19:55.295
YOU KNOW? I'M RUNNING
AS A LIBERTARIAN.

19:55.295 --> 19:56.926
WELL, I'M VOTING
AS A LIGHT SLEEPER.

19:56.926 --> 19:59.529
IT'S RIGHT OUTSIDE
OUR BEDROOM WINDOW.

19:59.529 --> 20:02.532
SERIOUSLY, LYNETTE, IT'S LIKE
LIVING NEXT TO SPLASH MOUNTAIN.

20:02.532 --> 20:06.205
BUT IT'S MY KIDS' TREE HOUSE.
THEY REALLY NEED IT.
 WELL, WE NEED OUR SLEEP.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.408
WHY DON'T YOU GET EARPLUGS?

20:08.408 --> 20:10.740
WHY DON'T YOU GET...
TREE HOUSE PLUGS?

20:10.740 --> 20:12.942
WHAT? THAT DOESN'T
EVEN MAKE SENSE.

20:12.942 --> 20:14.444
YEAH, I'M SORRY.

20:14.444 --> 20:17.347
YOU KNOW,
TIRED PEOPLE AREN'T WITTY.

20:19.389 --> 20:21.921
SERIOUSLY, JOHN, YOU HAVE
GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

20:21.921 --> 20:24.394
NO. PLEASE.
I NEED TO BE WITH YOU.

20:24.394 --> 20:27.297
WHAT ABOUT YOUR WIFE?
 YOU MET HER.
SHE'S DUMB, DEMANDING,

20:27.297 --> 20:29.859
TOTALLY SELF-CENTERED,
ESPECIALLY IN BED.

20:29.859 --> 20:31.361
I MEAN, SHE'S AWFUL.

20:31.361 --> 20:34.904
AWFULLY PREGNANT.
 I KNOW.
I-I'M COMPLETELY TRAPPED,

20:34.904 --> 20:36.906
JUST LIKE YOU WERE
WITH MR. SOLIS.

20:36.906 --> 20:38.368
WHA... (scoffs)

20:38.368 --> 20:40.270
I-I WASN'T "TRAPPED."

20:40.270 --> 20:41.771
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

20:41.771 --> 20:45.475
ALL YOU'D EVER TALK ABOUT
WAS WHAT A SELFISH PIG HE WAS.

20:45.475 --> 20:47.477
WELL, I THINK
YOU'RE PARAPHRASING.

20:47.477 --> 20:49.479
OKAY, SERIOUSLY,
YOU HAVE TO GO.

20:49.479 --> 20:52.482
COME ON. YOU KNOW IT WOULD
BE HOT, JUST LIKE OLD TIMES.

20:52.482 --> 20:57.587
REMEMBER HOW GREAT
OUR SEX WAS?
 OH, I DON'T THINK
WE NEED TO GET INTO THAT.

20:57.587 --> 21:01.391
WHAT ABOUT THE TIME WE WERE
DOING IT IN THE SHOWER?

21:01.391 --> 21:04.394
MR. SOLIS DROVE UP?
 UH, DOES NOT RING A BELL.

21:04.394 --> 21:06.396
COME ON.
AND I HID IN THE CLOSET?

21:06.396 --> 21:10.400
AND YOU LOOKED SO HOT, MR. SOLIS
PULLED YOU DOWN ON THE BED.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.001
(mouths word)

21:12.001 --> 21:14.744
AND YOU HAD TO FAKE AN ORGASM
JUST SO HE WOULDN'T CATCH ON.

21:14.744 --> 21:16.406
(mouths words)

21:16.406 --> 21:18.608
YEAH, GOOD TIMES.

21:18.608 --> 21:21.851
ANYWAYS, UH, THAT'S A NEGATORY
ON THE AFFAIR...
 WHAT?

21:21.851 --> 21:23.853
AND I WILL SEE YOU LATER.

21:23.853 --> 21:26.886
COME ON, BUT WE'RE SO GOOD
TOGETHER. GAB--

21:26.886 --> 21:28.418
PLEASE!

21:30.720 --> 21:32.291
(sighs deeply)

21:32.291 --> 21:35.325
BOY, THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE, HUH?

21:44.334 --> 21:45.835
YOU FAKED IT WITH ME

21:45.835 --> 21:48.438
WHILE THAT WAX JOB
WAS HIDING IN THE CLOSET?

21:48.438 --> 21:50.740
YES, I HAD AN AFFAIR.
OLD NEWS. MOVE ON.

21:50.740 --> 21:53.413
WHERE'S THAT ROOM SERVICE?
 SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA APOLOGIZE

21:53.413 --> 21:55.915
FOR HUMILIATING ME
IN MY OWN BED?

21:55.915 --> 21:59.589
YOU DESERVED IT. ALL YOU CARED
ABOUT BACK THEN WAS WORK.

21:59.589 --> 22:01.591
HEY, I WAS NOT THAT BAD
OF A HUSBAND,

22:01.591 --> 22:04.454
AND SOMEBODY HAD TO SUPPORT
YOUR ITALIAN SHOE ADDICTION.

22:04.454 --> 22:06.556
I SHOPPED BECAUSE
I WAS BORED AND LONELY--

22:06.556 --> 22:09.799
SAME REASON I HAD AN AFFAIR.
 YEAH,
WITH OUR TEENAGE GARDENER!

22:09.799 --> 22:12.031
I SHOULD HAVE SNAPPED
THAT KID'S NECK TWO YEARS AGO.

22:12.031 --> 22:15.104
OH, LET IT GO! JOHN ROWLAND
DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO YOU

22:15.104 --> 22:17.106
THAT YOU'RE NOT DOING
TO VICTOR.

22:17.106 --> 22:20.440
YOU CAN'T EVEN COMPARE THE TWO!
IT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT!

22:20.440 --> 22:23.543
IS IT,
MR. MAN IN THE CLOSET?

22:23.543 --> 22:25.645
YEAH, YOU HEARD ME.

22:25.645 --> 22:28.418
WHO'S JOHN ROWLAND NOW?

22:33.483 --> 22:35.354
(door slams)

22:37.056 --> 22:39.459
KATHERINE,
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

22:39.459 --> 22:41.661
JUST VISITING A FRIEND.

22:41.661 --> 22:45.995
LIAR. YOU'RE CAMPAIGNING.
COOKIES--NICE TOUCH.

22:45.995 --> 22:48.538
DITTO ON THE SCARF.

22:48.538 --> 22:49.739
(scoffs)

22:52.472 --> 22:54.644
EDIE, YOU GOT A MOMENT?

22:54.644 --> 22:57.376
I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT
OF THE HOMEOWNERS' ASSOCIATION,

22:57.376 --> 23:00.780
AND I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THAT HORRIBLE FOUNTAIN.

23:00.780 --> 23:03.553
SCREW THE FOUNTAIN.
YOU WANT MY SUPPORT?

23:03.553 --> 23:06.556
MAKE IDA GREENBERG DITCH
THAT SCREEN DOOR.

23:06.556 --> 23:08.758
THAT RUSTY,
OLD TETANUS BUCKET...

23:08.758 --> 23:10.690
LOOKS FINE TO ME.
IT'S HARDLY RIPPED AT ALL.

23:10.690 --> 23:13.062
IN FACT, IF YOU GIVE ME
YOUR SUPPORT...

23:13.062 --> 23:15.425
I'LL MAKE MRS. BURKETTE
PRUNE THOSE ROSES.

23:15.425 --> 23:17.396
IT'S A GARDEN, NOT A JUNGLE,

23:17.396 --> 23:19.398
ANDYOUSHOULDN'T HAVE TO...

23:19.398 --> 23:21.400
PAY FOR A FENCE
YOU DON'T EVEN WANT.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.073
THAT'S NOT HOW YOU MAKE
GOOD NEIGHBORS,

23:24.073 --> 23:27.076
(Lynette) AND I DON'T CARE IF...
 THE MUSTAFAS
DON'T CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS.

23:27.076 --> 23:29.639
YOU'RE ASKING THEM TO HANG
A FEW LIGHTS, NOT CONVERT.

23:29.639 --> 23:31.441
WHEN I'M PRESIDENT, I PROMISE...

23:31.441 --> 23:33.443
YOU CAN KEEP
THAT SATELLITE DISH.

23:33.443 --> 23:35.685
IN FACT, THIS IS PRACTICALLY
A FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUE.

23:35.685 --> 23:37.517
THE WAY I SEE IT...

23:37.517 --> 23:38.818
THE ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD

23:38.818 --> 23:41.851
SHOULD BE A TESTAMENT
TO SYMMETRY AND BEAUTY.

23:41.851 --> 23:42.992
SO...

23:42.992 --> 23:44.994
HAVE I GOT YOUR VOTE?

23:44.994 --> 23:46.996
UM, I'M NOT SURE YET.

23:46.996 --> 23:48.598
KEEP RUBBING.

23:59.539 --> 24:02.772
BREE, I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET,
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO EAT.

24:02.772 --> 24:05.444
I'M JUST SO MAD AT MYSELF.

24:05.444 --> 24:06.746
I SHOULD HAVE REALIZED

24:06.746 --> 24:08.748
THAT THE MATERNAL INSTINCT
IS SO STRONG,

24:08.748 --> 24:11.020
THAT EVEN DANIELLE
WOULD DEVELOP IT.

24:11.020 --> 24:14.684
(laughs)

24:14.684 --> 24:16.455
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

24:16.455 --> 24:18.928
YOU KNOW THOSE ANIMALS
WHO EAT THEIR YOUNG?

24:18.928 --> 24:21.861
EVEN THEY HAVE MORE MATERNAL
INSTINCT THAN DANIELLE.

24:21.861 --> 24:23.893
THEN WHY
WOULD SHE WANT THE CHILD?

24:23.893 --> 24:25.895
YOU'VE KNOWN HER HOW LONG,
AND YOU STILL HAVEN'T

24:25.895 --> 24:28.898
FIGURED OUT HOW THAT LENTIL
SHE CALLS A BRAIN WORKS?

24:28.898 --> 24:32.602
THERE'S NO NEED
TO INSULT YOUR SISTER.
 LET HIM TALK.

24:32.602 --> 24:34.744
ALL RIGHT, DANIELLE CARES
ABOUT THREE THINGS--

24:34.744 --> 24:38.708
DANIELLE, FUN, AND, UH...

24:38.708 --> 24:40.910
WAIT. I WAS WRONG.
IT'S JUST TWO.

24:40.910 --> 24:43.783
AND A RETIREMENT VILLAGE
IS FUN?

24:43.783 --> 24:45.785
COMPARED TO WHAT
YOU'RE OFFERING HER--

24:45.785 --> 24:47.787
A CRAPPY JOB
AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

24:47.787 --> 24:50.660
I MEAN, YOU THINK GRANDMA'S
GONNA MAKE HER DO ANY OF THAT?

24:50.660 --> 24:52.662
SO DANIELLE'S ONLY DOING THIS

24:52.662 --> 24:54.894
BECAUSE PHYLLIS
IS OFFERING HER A CUSHY LIFE?

24:54.894 --> 24:56.966
YEAH.
IF YOU WANT THAT BABY,

24:56.966 --> 24:59.729
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO OUTBID GRANDMA.

25:10.279 --> 25:12.281
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

25:12.281 --> 25:13.743
HI, JOHN.

25:13.743 --> 25:16.886
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU.

25:16.886 --> 25:19.518
IT'LL BE VERY FRIENDLY.
NO HITTING.

25:26.556 --> 25:27.897
WHAT'S UP?

25:27.897 --> 25:29.899
THIS IS GONNA SOUND WEIRD,
BUT, UH,

25:29.899 --> 25:34.103
I'VE BEEN DOING SOME
THINKING LATELY, AND, WELL,

25:34.103 --> 25:37.166
I'VE DECIDED THAT IT'S TIME
FOR ME TO FORGIVE YOU.

25:39.168 --> 25:41.871
FOR SLEEPING WITH MY WIFE.

25:44.143 --> 25:46.846
YEAH, WELL, I DIDN'T
JUST SLEEP WITH GABY.

25:46.846 --> 25:48.878
I FELL IN LOVE WITH HER.

25:52.221 --> 25:54.323
I FORGIVE YOU FOR THAT,
TOO.

25:56.856 --> 25:58.888
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

25:58.888 --> 26:01.661
YOU IN SOME KIND
OF 12-STEP PROGRAM?

26:01.661 --> 26:03.693
(exhales deeply)

26:03.693 --> 26:06.696
LET'S JUST SAY I'VE RECENTLY
LEARNED HOW LOVING SOMEONE

26:06.696 --> 26:09.769
MAKES YOU FORGET THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG.

26:15.104 --> 26:18.678
ANYWAY, THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT.
I SHOULD GO.

26:18.678 --> 26:21.010
HEY.

26:21.010 --> 26:23.182
DO YOU STILL TALK
TO GABRIELLE?

26:23.182 --> 26:25.815
OCCASIONALLY. WHY?

26:25.815 --> 26:29.759
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
IF SHE WAS HAPPY.

26:29.759 --> 26:32.321
I THINK SHE IS.

26:35.224 --> 26:37.827
WELL...

26:37.827 --> 26:39.729
GOOD FOR HER.

26:44.333 --> 26:46.676
(door shuts)

26:46.676 --> 26:49.679
ALL RIGHT, BEFORE WE VOTE,

26:49.679 --> 26:51.741
ARE THERE ANY MORE QUESTIONS
FOR THE CANDIDATES?

26:51.741 --> 26:54.013
ANYBODY BESIDES LEE?

26:54.013 --> 26:55.685
IT'S NOT A QUESTION.

26:55.685 --> 26:57.687
I JUST WANT
TO REMIND EVERYONE

26:57.687 --> 27:00.619
THAT A VOTE FOR KATHERINE
IS A VOTE FOR FASCISM.

27:00.619 --> 27:04.253
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU GAY PEOPLE
AND CLOTHES?

27:04.253 --> 27:06.796
FASCISM, IDA, NOT FASHION.

27:06.796 --> 27:10.700
ALTHOUGH IF YOU EVER
DO WANT TO TALK FASHION,

27:10.700 --> 27:11.931
WE'RE HERE FOR YOU.

27:11.931 --> 27:13.933
(Karen)
ALL RIGHT, DEBATE'S OVER.

27:13.933 --> 27:17.266
LET'S KICK THIS PIG.
ALL IN FAVOR OF LYNETTE?

27:23.743 --> 27:27.677
OKAY,
AND THOSE FOR KATHERINE?

27:33.422 --> 27:36.826
THAT'S 14 FOR LYNETTE
AND 14 FOR KATHERINE.

27:36.826 --> 27:39.258
SO WHAT DO WE DO? IT'S A TIE.

27:39.258 --> 27:40.830
(Edie) AH!

27:40.830 --> 27:42.331
NO, IT'S NOT.

27:42.331 --> 27:43.863
SUSAN VOTED TWICE.

27:47.336 --> 27:49.368
DID I?

27:49.368 --> 27:52.702
WELL, THAT'S OBVIOUSLY WRONG.

27:52.702 --> 27:55.144
YOU ONLY GET ONE VOTE,
SWEET CHEEKS. WHO'S IT GONNA BE?

28:09.719 --> 28:12.161
SUSAN, WE'RE WAITING.

28:12.161 --> 28:14.163
IT'S UP TO YOU, HON.

28:17.727 --> 28:19.698
KATHERINE.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.971
OH! (chuckles)

28:21.971 --> 28:24.473
OKAY, IT'S OFFICIAL.
KATHERINE IS OUR NEW PRESIDENT.

28:27.877 --> 28:30.209
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, EVERYONE,

28:30.209 --> 28:33.212
AND I PROMISE TO DO MY BEST
FOR THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.785
AND, BOB, LEE, MR. MUSTAFA,

28:35.785 --> 28:37.716
I'LL BE IN TOUCH REGARDING
YOUR VARIOUS INFRACTIONS.

28:37.716 --> 28:38.918
OH.

28:38.918 --> 28:40.820
AND YOU, TOO, LYNETTE.

28:43.252 --> 28:45.494
MEETING ADJOURNED.

28:45.494 --> 28:47.957
(man) OH.

28:47.957 --> 28:49.899
(Katherine sighs)

28:49.899 --> 28:52.902
(woman) I KNOW.
WELL, I'M NOT SURPRISED.

28:55.965 --> 28:58.107
(mouths words)

29:10.119 --> 29:11.981
♪♪♪

29:11.981 --> 29:13.482
YOU KNOW, PHYLLIS,

29:13.482 --> 29:16.856
WE CANNOT THANK YOU ENOUGH
FOR ACCEPTING OUR APOLOGY.

29:16.856 --> 29:19.859
WELL, I THINK WE SHOULD TRY
TO STAY ON GOOD TERMS

29:19.859 --> 29:22.932
FOR DANIELLE'S SAKE.

29:22.932 --> 29:25.234
I'M GLAD YOU SUGGESTED
THAT WE EAT OUT HERE.

29:25.234 --> 29:28.337
I NEVER THINK TO DO THIS.

29:28.337 --> 29:30.339
OH, DARN,
I FORGOT THE NAPKINS.

29:30.339 --> 29:32.341
OH, NO PROBLEM.

29:32.341 --> 29:34.303
I'LL GO GET SOME.

29:35.845 --> 29:39.208
SO NOW THAT WE HAVE
A MOMENT ALONE,

29:39.208 --> 29:42.781
YOUR MOTHER AND I WOULD LIKE
TO SAY HOW PROUD WE ARE OF YOU.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.113
YEAH, RIGHT.

29:44.113 --> 29:47.957
SERIOUSLY, WE HADN'T REALIZED
YOU'D MATURED ENOUGH

29:47.957 --> 29:50.820
TO TAKE ON THE BURDEN
OF MOTHERHOOD ALL BY YOURSELF.

29:50.820 --> 29:52.892
WELL, GRANDMA'S GONNA HELP.

29:52.892 --> 29:55.895
SHE'LL DO WHAT SHE CAN,
BUT YOU MUSTN'T OVERTAX HER.

29:55.895 --> 29:58.197
HER HEART IS NOT VERY STRONG.

29:58.197 --> 30:00.069
SHE SEEMS FINE TO ME.

30:00.069 --> 30:01.570
WELL, KNOCK WOOD.

30:01.570 --> 30:04.403
WE'D HATE TO SEE YOU FORCED
TO TAKE CARE OF A BABY

30:04.403 --> 30:06.475
ANDA SICK OLD WOMAN.

30:06.475 --> 30:09.578
WHOA! MAH-JONGG.
DON'T SEE THAT MUCH ANYMORE.

30:11.410 --> 30:13.883
HEY, HEY.

30:15.214 --> 30:17.947
DANIELLE,
YOU SHOULD INTRODUCE YOURSELF.

30:17.947 --> 30:20.389
THESE PEOPLE
ARE YOUR NEW FRIENDS.
 MM.

30:20.389 --> 30:22.391
AND YOU'RE GOING TO
LEARN MORE

30:22.391 --> 30:24.393
FROM THEIR EXPERIENCE
AND WISDOM

30:24.393 --> 30:27.156
THAN YOU EVER COULD HAVE LEARNED
AT THAT COLLEGE IN FLORIDA.

30:27.156 --> 30:28.958
WAIT. I THOUGHT
I COULDN'T GO THERE.

30:28.958 --> 30:30.960
YOU SAID IT WAS
JUST A PARTY SCHOOL.

30:30.960 --> 30:32.962
WELL, ACTUALLY, WE CHECKED
INTO THE CURRICULUM,

30:32.962 --> 30:35.004
AND IT'S VERY STRONG,
BUT NO MATTER.

30:35.004 --> 30:38.007
YOU'RE BE HAPPIER HERE.
 YES, AND WITH A GRANDMOTHER'S
UNCONDITIONAL LOVE,

30:38.007 --> 30:41.140
WHO NEEDS FRAT BOYS WHO ONLY
LIKE YOU FOR YOUR CONVERTIBLE?

30:41.140 --> 30:43.112
WHOA. WHEN DID I GET
A CONVERTIBLE?

30:43.112 --> 30:46.115
WELL, WE WERE GONNA SURPRISE YOU
WITH ONE FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY,

30:46.115 --> 30:48.617
BUT SINCE YOU'RE KEEPING
THE BABY, YOU'LL WANT

30:48.617 --> 30:51.620
A MORE PRACTICAL GIFT.
 WE'RE THINKING
A DIAPER SERVICE.

30:51.620 --> 30:54.153
OH, LOOK,
THEY HAVE WATER AEROBICS.

30:54.153 --> 30:55.284
(women) UP!

30:55.284 --> 30:58.427
OUT. OUT.

30:58.427 --> 31:00.589
YOU SHOULD SIGN UP.

31:03.893 --> 31:07.997
YOU KNOW, MAYBE ISHOULD
 GO TO COLLEGE.

31:07.997 --> 31:09.999
I MEAN, FOR THE BABY'S SAKE.

31:09.999 --> 31:12.041
HOW CAN I SUPPORT IT
WITHOUT A DEGREE?

31:12.041 --> 31:16.045
BUT YOU CAN'T RAISE THIS CHILD
IN A MIAMI DORM ROOM.

31:16.045 --> 31:18.948
YOU'LL NEED TO LEAVE IT
WITH SOMEONE YOU CAN TRUST

31:18.948 --> 31:21.981
TO TAKE CARE OF IT PROPERLY.

31:21.981 --> 31:25.054
(sighs) SORRY.

31:25.054 --> 31:27.056
THE ELEVATOR'S OUT. I...
(panting)

31:27.056 --> 31:29.558
OH. I HAVE TO CATCH MY BREATH.

31:29.558 --> 31:32.992
(fan whirring)

31:35.524 --> 31:36.565
(breathing heavily)

31:36.565 --> 31:39.128
GRANDMA?

31:39.128 --> 31:40.930
WE NEED TO TALK.

31:51.240 --> 31:52.541
WHAT'S THIS?

31:52.541 --> 31:54.443
I THOUGHT WE MIGHT TOAST
MY VICTORY.

31:54.443 --> 31:57.486
I'M KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING HERE.

31:57.486 --> 31:59.989
OH.

31:59.989 --> 32:04.293
SO... YOU HAVEN'T
CONGRATULATED ME YET.

32:04.293 --> 32:06.095
I KNOW.

32:07.626 --> 32:10.129
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TELL ME
WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU?

32:10.129 --> 32:13.132
I JUST WANT YOU TO THINK
ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING

32:13.132 --> 32:15.204
FOR THE PAST FEW DAYS.

32:15.204 --> 32:17.967
YOU'VE MOUNTED A CRUSADE
AGAINST A METAL THING

32:17.967 --> 32:20.469
THAT SHOOTS OUT WATER.
 I'M TRYING TO KEEP
THE NEIGHBORHOOD BEAUTIFUL.

32:20.469 --> 32:21.971
I LOVE THIS STREET.

32:21.971 --> 32:24.974
YEAH, YOU KEEP SAYING THAT--
HOW HAPPY YOU USED TO BE HERE,

32:24.974 --> 32:26.976
BUT EVER SINCE
WE'VE MOVED BACK,

32:26.976 --> 32:28.978
ALL I'VE SEEN
IS AN UNHAPPY WOMAN

32:28.978 --> 32:30.980
WHO NEEDS
TO CONTROL EVERYTHING.

32:30.980 --> 32:34.423
WELL... WE'VE BOTH LEARNED
WHAT HAPPENS

32:34.423 --> 32:36.085
WHEN YOU LOSE CONTROL.

32:36.085 --> 32:39.688
OH. CHICAGO AGAIN.

32:39.688 --> 32:42.191
TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE
WE LEARNED THERE.

32:42.191 --> 32:46.195
WHEN THE CHIPS ARE DOWN,
IT HELPS TO HAVE FRIENDS.

32:46.195 --> 32:50.339
AND YOU CERTAINLY
HAVEN'T MADE US ANY LATELY.

32:50.339 --> 32:52.341
CONGRATULATIONS.

33:01.180 --> 33:02.351
BYE, GRANDMA.

33:02.351 --> 33:05.114
GOOD-BYE, DEAR.

33:05.114 --> 33:07.386
TELL YOUR STEPFATHER
I'LL BE RIGHT OUT.

33:08.987 --> 33:11.560
(door shuts)

33:13.162 --> 33:15.664
OH, PLEASE, PHYLLIS.
EVEN YOU HAVE TO AGREE

33:15.664 --> 33:18.667
THAT A GIRL WHO'D TRADE
HER BABY FOR A CONVERTIBLE

33:18.667 --> 33:20.469
ISN'T READY FOR MOTHERHOOD.

33:20.469 --> 33:24.103
SHE'D HAVE CHANGED
ONCE THE BABY CAME.

33:24.103 --> 33:25.534
SHE'S HER FATHER'S DAUGHTER.

33:30.379 --> 33:33.112
THAT'S A NICE PICTURE
OF REX.

33:33.112 --> 33:36.014
OH, I HAVE
A LOT OF PICTURES.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.016
ALL OF THE WOMEN HERE DO.

33:40.149 --> 33:42.291
THEY'RE WHAT WE HAVE LEFT
OF THE THINGS

33:42.291 --> 33:44.293
TIME HAS TAKEN FROM US...

33:46.355 --> 33:51.730
YOUTH, HOMES AND HUSBANDS...

33:51.730 --> 33:57.106
AND FOR THE UNLUCKIEST,
CHILDREN.

33:57.106 --> 34:01.140
I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING BACK
A PART OF REX.

34:01.140 --> 34:03.342
BUT NOW...

34:06.075 --> 34:08.077
I KNOW YOU'RE LONELY,
PHYLLIS,

34:08.077 --> 34:11.280
BUT I CAN'T GIVE UP THIS CHILD
JUST TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

34:11.280 --> 34:16.054
YOU SHOULD GO.
YOURFAMILY'SWAITING FOR YOU.

34:24.233 --> 34:27.735
ORSON AND I GO TO OUR CLUB
ALMOST EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT,

34:27.735 --> 34:31.570
IF YOU'RE... INTERESTED
IN BABYSITTING.

34:31.570 --> 34:34.243
YOU MEAN IT?

34:36.245 --> 34:38.777
HOW WILL YOU EXPLAIN ME
TO YOUR FRIENDS?

34:38.777 --> 34:41.610
I'LL SAY THAT YOU'RE BROKE
AND NEEDED THE MONEY.

34:41.610 --> 34:46.215
CAN'T YOU JUST SAY THAT
YOU LIKE HAVING ME AROUND?

34:46.215 --> 34:49.788
I NEED SOMETHING
THAT WILL FLY, PHYLLIS.

35:01.170 --> 35:02.501
HEY. WHAT'S GOING ON?

35:02.501 --> 35:05.134
WE NEED TO TALK.

35:07.136 --> 35:08.437
SO HERE'S THE DEAL.

35:08.437 --> 35:11.440
I THINK IT'S TIME FOR US
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

35:11.440 --> 35:14.413
(groans) I DON'T THINK
I LIKE WHERE THIS IS GOING.

35:14.413 --> 35:16.415
WE HAVE TO END THIS AFFAIR.

35:16.415 --> 35:17.586
YOU SERIOUS?

35:17.586 --> 35:21.350
ALL THIS... SNEAKING AROUND,
WEARING DISGUISES,

35:21.350 --> 35:24.323
HIDING IN CLOSETS--
IT'S JUST WRONG.

35:24.323 --> 35:25.854
WE'RE BETTER THAN THIS.

35:25.854 --> 35:29.558
SO WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING,
WE STAY WITH VICTOR AND EDIE?

35:29.558 --> 35:32.301
NO, WE BREAK UP WITHTHEM.

35:32.301 --> 35:34.303
LOOK, IT'LL HURT,
BUT AT LEAST IT'S HONEST.

35:34.303 --> 35:37.306
AND THEN WHEN ENOUGH TIME HAS
GONE BY AND THEY'VE MOVED ON,

35:37.306 --> 35:38.807
WE CAN BE TOGETHER.

35:38.807 --> 35:40.769
HOW LONG
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

35:40.769 --> 35:42.871
I DON'T KNOW. SIX MONTHS?

35:42.871 --> 35:45.874
SIX MONTHS? NOBODY TAKES
THAT LONG TO HEAL ANYMORE.

35:45.874 --> 35:47.876
IT'S A BREAKUP,
NOT A FACE-LIFT.

35:47.876 --> 35:50.379
HEY, LOOK, I WANT US
TO BE TOGETHER, TOO,

35:50.379 --> 35:53.552
BUT I ALSO WANNA
FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT.

35:53.552 --> 35:55.484
DON'T YOU?

35:57.686 --> 36:01.460
YEAH. I DO.

36:01.460 --> 36:05.194
(sighs) YOU'RE SUCH
A GOOD GUY, CARLOS.

36:05.194 --> 36:07.666
I REALLY HATE THAT ABOUT YOU.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.468
I KNOW.

36:11.240 --> 36:15.674
SO... I GUESS THIS IS IT.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.479
THIS KISS HAS TO LAST
SIX MONTHS.

36:20.479 --> 36:22.651
YOU BETTER MAKE IT GOOD.

36:26.515 --> 36:29.718
(camera shutter clicking)

36:46.335 --> 36:48.977
HIS GUY CAN FLY.
MY GUY FREEZE.

36:53.211 --> 36:54.783
HEY, LYNETTE.

36:54.783 --> 36:56.785
HEY, JUDAS.

36:56.785 --> 36:58.787
OKAY, FINE.
YOU'RE STILL ANGRY,

36:58.787 --> 37:00.789
BUT I'M GONNA MAKE IT UP
TO YOU.

37:00.789 --> 37:02.791
WHEN THEY COME AFTER
THAT TREE HOUSE,

37:02.791 --> 37:05.324
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE
ONE SUSAN MAYER CHAINED TO IT.

37:05.324 --> 37:08.597
DON'T DO THAT. I WANNA BE SAD
WHEN THEY KNOCK IT DOWN.
 LYNETTE!

37:08.597 --> 37:11.300
WHAT? YOU THINK
YOU CAN JUST WALK OVER HERE

37:11.300 --> 37:14.232
AND CUTE YOUR WAY
OUT OF WHAT YOU DID?

37:14.232 --> 37:16.234
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE FRIENDS.
 EXACTLY,

37:16.234 --> 37:19.237
AND FRIENDS DON'T PUT FRIENDS
IN THIS KIND OF POSITION.

37:19.237 --> 37:20.969
I LOVE YOU,
BUT YOU CAN'T ASK ME

37:20.969 --> 37:22.971
TO PUT YOUR KIDS
AHEAD OF MY HUSBAND.

37:22.971 --> 37:25.974
(water stops running)
 (Porter) NO, PARKER, THAT GUY
DOESN'T HAVE FREEZING...

37:25.974 --> 37:28.477
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT.

37:30.649 --> 37:33.652
BUT THAT TREE HOUSE IS
THE ONE PLACE MY KIDS CAN GO

37:33.652 --> 37:37.786
AND NOT HEAR ABOUT BODY SCANS
AND WHITE BLOOD CELL COUNTS.

37:37.786 --> 37:41.960
IT IS THEIR GETAWAY
FROM THIS HORRIBLE THING

37:41.960 --> 37:43.832
THAT I'VE BROUGHT
INTO THE HOUSE.

37:43.832 --> 37:48.266
"BROUGHT"? SWEETIE, IT'S NOT
YOUR FAULT THAT YOU'RE SICK.

37:48.266 --> 37:51.970
I KNOW THAT... HERE.
BUT HERE...

37:51.970 --> 37:55.273
(voice breaks) IT FEELS LIKE
I'VE RUINED THEIR CHILDHOOD.

37:57.045 --> 37:59.047
OKAY, IF ANYBODY NEEDS ME,

37:59.047 --> 38:01.550
I'LL BE AT THE HARDWARE STORE
BUYING CHAINS.

38:01.550 --> 38:03.812
OH, JEEZ. GET OVER HERE.

38:03.812 --> 38:07.816
(Katherine) HELLO THERE!

38:07.816 --> 38:11.420
OH, LOOK, IT'S OUR NEW QUEEN--
KATHERINE OF ARROGANT.
 (chuckles)

38:11.420 --> 38:13.722
HEY,
WHERE'S THE WRECKING BALL?

38:13.722 --> 38:16.495
ACTUALLY, I CAME TO TELL YOU
THE TREE HOUSE CAN STAY.

38:16.495 --> 38:18.397
OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S GREAT!

38:18.397 --> 38:20.399
YES. IF ANYONE COMPLAINS,
WE'LL SAY

38:20.399 --> 38:24.603
IT WAS GRANDFATHERED IN UNDER
THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION.

38:24.603 --> 38:26.975
WOW.

38:26.975 --> 38:29.738
THANKS. WHY?

38:29.738 --> 38:32.441
CLEARLY,
IT MEANS A LOT TO YOU,

38:32.441 --> 38:34.443
AND I WANNA BE
A GOOD NEIGHBOR.

38:36.044 --> 38:37.416
KATHERINE.

38:38.687 --> 38:41.690
WHAT'S WITH YOU? SOMETIMES YOU
ACT LIKE AN ICE QUEEN,

38:41.690 --> 38:44.623
AND THEN YOU DO
SOMETHING REALLY NICE.

38:44.623 --> 38:47.325
YOU ARE
ONE COMPLICATED LADY.

38:47.325 --> 38:51.730
WELL, I'VE HAD
ONE COMPLICATED LIFE.

38:57.466 --> 39:00.539
I'VE HAD A LOT OF MEN
IN MY LIFE,

39:00.539 --> 39:03.512
BUT I NEVER LET MYSELF
FALL IN LOVE BEFORE.

39:03.512 --> 39:06.515
I THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE
I DIDN'T WANNA GET HURT,

39:06.515 --> 39:10.449
BUT... NOW I KNOW
THE PAIN YOU FEEL

39:10.449 --> 39:13.552
ISN'T THE WORST PART.

39:13.552 --> 39:15.624
IT'S THE HATE.

39:17.355 --> 39:20.028
COULD YOU MAKE IT OUT
TO "CASH"?

39:20.028 --> 39:21.890
(chuckles)

39:33.772 --> 39:35.874
(exhales deeply)
HELLO, KATHERINE.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.876
YOU HERE ABOUT THE FOUNTAIN?

39:37.876 --> 39:40.378
YES, BUT DON'T WORRY.
THERE'S NO STRICT DEADLINE.

39:40.378 --> 39:44.613
YOU CAN... HAVE IT REMOVED
AT YOUR EARLIEST CONVENIENCE.

39:44.613 --> 39:47.916
YEAH, I DON'T THINK
IT'S GOING ANYWHERE.

39:47.916 --> 39:51.820
OH, BOYS, BOYS,
THE WAR'S OVER.

39:51.820 --> 39:54.663
YES, IT IS.

39:54.663 --> 39:56.895
WE KNOW
ALL ABOUT CHICAGO.

39:56.895 --> 39:59.127
COME AGAIN?

39:59.127 --> 40:01.630
MY EX IS ON THE BOARD
OF CHICAGO MEMORIAL HOSPITAL.

40:01.630 --> 40:04.132
SEEMS YOUR HUSBAND
MADE QUITE A STIR THERE--

40:04.132 --> 40:07.005
WHOLE HOSPITAL STILL
BUZZING ABOUT WHAT HE DID.

40:07.005 --> 40:09.508
WHATEVER YOU HEARD
IS A VICIOUS LIE--

40:09.508 --> 40:11.980
EVERY WORD OF IT.

40:11.980 --> 40:14.583
(both chuckle)

40:14.583 --> 40:18.517
STILL, IT WAS ENOUGH TO...
MAKE YOU LEAVE TOWN,

40:18.517 --> 40:22.951
WHICH BEGS THE QUESTION,
DO YOU LIKE LIVING HERE?

40:26.024 --> 40:29.057
OH, GOOD. WE'RE IN AGREEMENT.
THE FOUNTAIN STAYS.

40:31.099 --> 40:33.602
THANKS FOR STOPPING BY,
KATHERINE.

40:35.433 --> 40:39.638
IT'S THE SAME FOR ALL OF US.

40:42.941 --> 40:45.574
WE TRY NOT TO GET TOO CLOSE

40:45.574 --> 40:48.947
TO THE PEOPLE
WHO LIVE NEXT DOOR.

40:48.947 --> 40:52.220
IT'S EASIER TO GIVE THEM
A POLITE NOD

40:52.220 --> 40:54.523
THAN TO ASK WHAT'S WRONG.

40:54.523 --> 40:56.855
(crying)

40:56.855 --> 41:00.959
IT'S SAFER TO KEEP WALKING BY
THAN TO GET INVOLVED.

41:00.959 --> 41:03.461
...YOU RIGHT NOW.
OKAY, I DON'T WANNA WORK...

41:03.461 --> 41:06.765
TRUE, WE SOMETIMES DO
GET TO KNOW THE PEOPLE

41:06.765 --> 41:10.939
WE SHARE A FENCE WITH
AND END UP LIFELONG FRIENDS.

41:10.939 --> 41:13.602
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.
 THANK YOU.

41:13.602 --> 41:16.605
BUT MOSTLY,
WE KEEP OUR DISTANCE

41:16.605 --> 41:18.707
BECAUSE WE'D RATHER
OUR NEIGHBORS

41:18.707 --> 41:21.249
KNOW NOTHING ABOUT US...

41:26.785 --> 41:28.787
THAN KNOW TOO MUCH.
