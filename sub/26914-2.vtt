[Lucky groans]

00:51.801 --> 00:52.802
[she moans]

00:54.387 --> 00:56.473
Ugh, why are you so noisy?

00:57.015 --> 00:59.684
[Julian] Morning, R.F.!
Still snoring?

00:59.768 --> 01:02.187
Hey, thanks again
for letting me take your bed.

01:02.937 --> 01:05.482
That couch is torture
on my bad back.

01:05.565 --> 01:06.399
[she sighs]

01:06.483 --> 01:08.276
[Lucky] When are you leaving again?

01:08.443 --> 01:11.154
-[Julian] What's that, R.F.?
-When are you leaving again?

01:11.237 --> 01:13.323
Oh, good, Julian, you're up.

01:14.407 --> 01:17.243
[sighs] Lucky, just because
your father and Kate

01:17.327 --> 01:20.580
are away on their honeymoon
is no excuse to sleep all day.

01:20.663 --> 01:24.542
And strive to start your mornings chipper.
Like your cousin.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.628
It sets the tone for the entire day.

01:29.380 --> 01:31.132
-[Julian hums]
-[sighs angrily]

01:31.841 --> 01:32.675
Morning, Spirit.

01:33.301 --> 01:36.346
Hmm. Boy, could I use a ride.
I'll be right out.

01:36.429 --> 01:38.264
[Aunt Cora] Lucky, breakfast!

01:40.016 --> 01:41.434
Right after breakfast.

01:43.353 --> 01:44.354
You're in my chair.

01:44.646 --> 01:49.150
-Am I? Oh, I... I didn't know.
-We had this exact conversation yesterday!

01:49.234 --> 01:53.905
Ugh, Lucky, Julian is a guest!
You can sit in a different chair.

01:53.988 --> 01:56.741
-Mmm. Breakfast looks good, Aunt Cora.
-Good?

01:56.825 --> 01:57.909
It looks great!

01:58.326 --> 02:02.288
I've eaten at all the finest restaurants
and Cora's cooking tops them all.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.458
Well, I do try my best.

02:10.255 --> 02:12.423
-[she grunts]
-[Aunt Cora screams]

02:13.049 --> 02:13.925
Oh!

02:14.008 --> 02:16.803
Lucky, what has gotten into you?

02:17.220 --> 02:20.181
The last few days,
you've been downright childish.

02:20.348 --> 02:23.268
I'm sorry, Aunt Cora.
I couldn't reach the syrup.

02:23.351 --> 02:24.894
Why didn't you just ask, R.F.?

02:26.229 --> 02:29.440
Now, after breakfast,
I need your help airing out the rugs.

02:29.649 --> 02:32.068
And washing the curtains.
Ironing them, too, of course.

02:32.652 --> 02:33.820
Oh, and the silver.

02:33.903 --> 02:37.031
I want this house immaculate
for the returning newlyweds.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.909
Ah, wish I could, Aunt Cora, but I'm...

02:40.618 --> 02:42.996
scouting out Cannon City today.

02:43.079 --> 02:46.499
You see, I don't wanna just rely
on the Prescott name.

02:46.749 --> 02:48.626
I want to make a name for myself.

02:49.252 --> 02:51.629
It's time I started thinking
about my future.

02:52.046 --> 02:53.631
Could you and Lucky manage without me?

02:53.715 --> 02:56.718
-Just this once?
-[Aunt Cora] Oh, of course we can.

02:57.302 --> 03:00.555
After all, "Opportunity is bald behind...

03:01.890 --> 03:04.642
- Hmm?
- ...You must grab him by the forelock"?

03:05.518 --> 03:07.896
Of course, or opportunity will get away!

03:08.062 --> 03:11.941
Can't catch him once he's passed
cos he's bald

03:12.025 --> 03:12.901
Exactly.

03:13.067 --> 03:15.612
Ah, Lucky, you should follow
your cousin's example...

03:15.695 --> 03:16.696
[slurps]

03:19.157 --> 03:21.242
[Pru] Cutting through the valley
is not cheating.

03:21.326 --> 03:22.160
Is so when you say,

03:22.243 --> 03:24.037
"Race you to the end
of Little Creek Trail!"

03:24.120 --> 03:26.331
I didn't say you had to take
Little Creek Trail.

03:26.414 --> 03:27.832
You just had to get to the end.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.167
And I did.

03:29.334 --> 03:30.209
First.

03:31.920 --> 03:32.921
[Lucky gasps]

03:33.755 --> 03:35.423
You're seeing this too, right?

03:39.719 --> 03:40.845
[Pru] Whoa!

03:40.929 --> 03:42.472
-Amazing.
-[Lucky] Look at that.

03:43.014 --> 03:44.724
-Whoa!
-Someone pinch me!

03:45.725 --> 03:47.977
Ladies! So glad you're here.

03:48.144 --> 03:49.229
It's so...

03:49.687 --> 03:50.563
And...

03:50.980 --> 03:53.441
-How?
-Well, cousin, I'm glad you asked.

03:53.733 --> 03:57.737
I went to the city to find my future,
and instead I found THE future!

03:58.071 --> 04:00.657
Ground travel is a thing
of the dusty, sweaty past.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.325
-No offense, Spirit.
-[Abigail] Ooh!

04:02.492 --> 04:04.535
Soon, mankind will travel by balloon.

04:04.619 --> 04:07.163
Every man, woman, and child,
will have their own!

04:07.330 --> 04:08.539
And I'm gonna sell it to them.

04:08.623 --> 04:09.832
This is just the first.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.460
Once I sell some tethered rides,
I'll buy a whole fleet!

04:13.044 --> 04:14.170
Course, I'll need help.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.257
After our many adventures,
I could probably cut you all in.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.342
Remember, it's Julian,

04:19.467 --> 04:21.427
so this is just another
one of his schemes.

04:21.552 --> 04:23.012
Yes. A scheme...

04:23.346 --> 04:24.806
that we will avoid.

04:25.598 --> 04:27.892
-Right after we ride in the balloon.
-Step right up!

04:28.768 --> 04:29.769
Oh!
[screams]

04:30.395 --> 04:31.896
-[Pru] All right!
-Just one dollar!

04:32.230 --> 04:33.231
You're charging us?

04:33.314 --> 04:35.692
-What a deal!
-Lucky, I'm a businessman.

04:35.775 --> 04:36.818
You wouldn't respect me,

04:36.901 --> 04:38.820
and more importantly,
I wouldn't respect me,

04:38.903 --> 04:40.738
if I didn't charge a fair price.

04:48.246 --> 04:49.497
[Abigail] Ooh.

04:55.169 --> 04:56.129
[Pru and Lucky] Wow!

04:56.212 --> 04:58.381
-[Pru] I can see Miradero!
-[Abigai] Oh, it's beautiful!

04:59.173 --> 05:01.384
With these you can practically see
Cannon City.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.303
Hey! Those are my binoculars.

05:03.386 --> 05:05.054
Sorry, R.F. Didn't think you'd mind.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.472
Well, I do mind!

05:06.639 --> 05:08.474
Come on, think of it as an investment.

05:08.725 --> 05:11.311
Don't you want in on the ground floor
of my balloon business--?

05:11.394 --> 05:12.854
O-our balloon business?

05:15.815 --> 05:17.859
Fine. You can use them.

05:17.942 --> 05:19.235
You won't regret it, partner.

05:19.610 --> 05:20.653
Have a look.

05:20.737 --> 05:21.904
[Lucky] This is...

05:22.739 --> 05:23.614
amazing.

05:23.698 --> 05:24.741
[Pru] Let me look.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.327
Ooh, what does this do?

05:28.077 --> 05:29.746
That's the vent line. It opens a vent.

05:29.829 --> 05:31.581
Very important stuff.

05:31.664 --> 05:34.667
-Ooh ooh, and this?
-Ah, the pilot light.

05:34.876 --> 05:38.004
Keeps the balloon full of hot air
and us floating through the clouds.

05:38.212 --> 05:41.382
OK, I'm definitely going to need to know
how that works.

05:42.258 --> 05:44.802
-[Aunt Cora hums]
-[whoosh of air]

05:45.887 --> 05:46.763
Huh?

05:46.846 --> 05:48.056
[Lucky] How far can we fly?

05:49.557 --> 05:50.808
Silver Lode? Africa?

05:50.892 --> 05:52.935
-Can we sleep on the--
-[Aunt Cora] What on earth?

05:53.436 --> 05:58.941
-What do you think Aunt Cora?
-[Aunt Cora] It's... It's... magnificent!

06:00.485 --> 06:01.360
You like it?

06:01.652 --> 06:04.363
You don't think it's unsightly?
Unseemly?

06:04.822 --> 06:05.782
Unsophisticated?

06:06.032 --> 06:06.949
Any of the "un's"?

06:07.033 --> 06:08.242
[Aunt Cora] Of course not!

06:08.326 --> 06:11.079
Well, I was taken up in a balloon
at the World's Fair

06:11.162 --> 06:12.497
when I was younger than you.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.541
Oh, how the city sparkled beneath me.

06:16.125 --> 06:18.503
It was the most magical experience
of my life.

06:18.586 --> 06:19.796
Up until now.

06:20.254 --> 06:22.131
It's getting dark,
but first thing tomorrow,

06:22.298 --> 06:23.299
I'm taking you up.

06:23.883 --> 06:24.884
Oh!

06:25.968 --> 06:27.637
[whistling cheerfully]

06:28.679 --> 06:31.766
-[woman] Can I help you?
-[man] We're looking for Julian Prescott.

06:32.433 --> 06:34.644
-You know where the Prescott house is?
-Uh-uh.

06:34.727 --> 06:37.605
-[man] He's a blonde kid.
-[woman] Doesn't ring a bell. I'm sorry.

06:37.688 --> 06:39.232
[man] Thank you very much, ma'am.

06:44.028 --> 06:46.280
-When was Julian supposed to take you up?
-Now.

06:46.948 --> 06:50.284
Oh, and I hope he hurries.
I have to help Althea at the Inn later.

06:50.368 --> 06:52.870
He probably forgot. That's Julian.

06:53.371 --> 06:56.916
You always think the worst of your cousin.
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

06:56.999 --> 06:58.835
You don't know him like I do.

06:59.585 --> 07:01.087
-[Aunt Cora] Hm.
-[Clancy squawks]

07:03.756 --> 07:05.049
You know, Aunt Cora,

07:05.133 --> 07:07.301
you don't have to wait
around all day for Julian.

07:07.593 --> 07:08.469
I could take you up.

07:08.553 --> 07:09.762
-You?
-Sure!

07:09.846 --> 07:11.013
We're partners.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.516
He taught me everything
about the balloon yesterday.

07:13.850 --> 07:16.561
The pilot light, the vents,
all the ropes...

07:17.061 --> 07:18.813
Plus, the balloon'll be tied down.

07:19.439 --> 07:23.776
Hm. I did promise Clancy
I'd show him the magic of flight.

07:24.235 --> 07:26.487
I suppose if the balloon is tethered...

07:27.321 --> 07:30.199
-Are you sure about this, Lucky?
-Absolutely, Aunt Cora.

07:30.450 --> 07:33.786
I'll have the balloon inflated
and you climbing into the sky in no time.

07:36.038 --> 07:37.707
[tense music]

07:39.041 --> 07:40.042
[Julian gasps]

07:40.376 --> 07:42.545
[second man] Vamos.
Let's go get that troublemaker.

07:45.715 --> 07:48.092
-Mira.
-[man] Son of a gun. Found him!

07:49.469 --> 07:50.470
Argh!

07:56.392 --> 07:58.102
[Lucky laughs] It's OK, Spirit.

07:58.186 --> 07:59.979
I'll be back down before you know it.

08:00.062 --> 08:02.106
Oh-oh... Ooh.

08:02.815 --> 08:04.859
I feel... weightless.

08:05.526 --> 08:08.362
[Aunt Cora] Thank you, Lucky.
[she giggles]

08:08.446 --> 08:09.447
[Lucky] Julian?

08:09.780 --> 08:12.158
-I knew he wouldn't forget.
-[Julian] Hold up! I'm here!

08:12.241 --> 08:15.203
You didn't have to run.
I was just going to take Aunt Cora up.

08:15.286 --> 08:17.330
Lucky, a balloon's a complicated vessel.

08:17.538 --> 08:19.540
You need an experienced pilot at the helm.

08:22.376 --> 08:25.463
-[Julian grunts]
-[Spirit neighs loudly]

08:26.047 --> 08:27.173
[Julian grunts]

08:27.256 --> 08:30.426
Oh, it's just marvellous.

08:31.010 --> 08:31.886
[man] There he is!

08:37.099 --> 08:39.352
[Aunt Cora] Look at the mountains.
They're glorious!

08:39.435 --> 08:40.603
Lucky! What did you do?

08:40.686 --> 08:43.564
The tether's not attached.
The balloon isn't tied down.

08:44.148 --> 08:45.066
But I checked it!

08:45.149 --> 08:47.151
It looked just like
when you did it yesterday.

08:47.235 --> 08:48.569
Whoa!
[whimpers]

08:48.653 --> 08:51.405
[Aunt Cora excitedly] Oh my, here we go!

08:53.991 --> 08:56.827
Well, Aunt Cora, I... I guess
you're getting the deluxe ride.

08:57.119 --> 08:59.080
Just drop me in Paris.

09:00.164 --> 09:02.124
I can see over Punta Libre!

09:02.208 --> 09:04.293
And look! It's the Ramada!

09:09.465 --> 09:11.050
-[gasps]
-[Clancy squawks]

09:11.467 --> 09:14.220
-Clancy!
-[vroom]

09:16.847 --> 09:17.723
[Abigail] Whoa!

09:19.183 --> 09:21.602
Clancy, you can fly?

09:22.186 --> 09:23.813
Clancy, where'd you come from?

09:26.857 --> 09:31.070
-Wow! They're going on a real ride!
-Come on. Let's meet them where they land.

09:37.076 --> 09:40.246
We're pretty far from town.
Seems like a safe place to land.

09:40.538 --> 09:41.831
Oh, do we have to?

09:42.582 --> 09:44.875
Don't worry,
there'll be plenty more rides, Aunt Cora.

09:44.959 --> 09:45.918
I promise.

09:47.295 --> 09:48.713
[all] Whoa!

09:48.796 --> 09:50.965
[they scream]

09:51.591 --> 09:54.552
[Aunt Cora] Julian help!
[screams]

09:54.635 --> 09:56.637
-[Aunt Cora screams]
-[Spirit whinnies]

09:56.721 --> 09:59.181
-They're landing!
-Landing? Or crashing?

10:00.182 --> 10:01.350
[Julian struggles]

10:01.934 --> 10:03.102
Do something, Julian!

10:03.185 --> 10:05.521
Lucky, please. Let him concentrate.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.189
-[Julian grunts]
-[Lucky screams]

10:08.274 --> 10:11.193
-[they scream]
-[Julian sighs with relief and laughs]

10:11.277 --> 10:12.111
[Aunt Cora] Oh my!

10:17.658 --> 10:19.243
Now I know why the rides were tethered.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.996
Because you don't actually know
how to fly the balloon, do you?

10:22.079 --> 10:25.791
Lucky, could I really not know
how to fly my own balloon?

10:25.875 --> 10:26.834
Yeah.

10:26.917 --> 10:28.544
The only reason we're in this mess

10:28.628 --> 10:31.422
is because you took up the balloon
without my permission

10:31.505 --> 10:32.506
and didn't secure it!

10:33.966 --> 10:35.343
I thought it was tied.

10:36.052 --> 10:37.261
I blame myself.

10:37.762 --> 10:39.722
I shouldn't have listened to you, Lucky.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.894
-[Abigail] I don't think they can land it.
-I don't think they can fly it!

10:45.645 --> 10:46.979
Julian's up to his old tricks!

10:53.277 --> 10:55.237
[grunts]
This worked fine yesterday.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.698
-You must've done something, Lucky.
-[Spirit whinnies]

10:58.282 --> 10:59.575
[Lucky] Look, it's Spirit!

10:59.659 --> 11:00.743
And Pru and Abigail!

11:01.202 --> 11:02.286
They're following us!

11:04.538 --> 11:07.083
Oh, my sweet jellybeans,
Lucky's inside a cloud.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.251
-[tense music]
-[Aunt Cora] What's happening?

11:09.335 --> 11:10.628
Are we turning?

11:10.711 --> 11:13.297
I can't tell. I don't see anything.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.424
Julian? What do we do?

11:15.674 --> 11:18.427
It feels like we're changing directions.

11:18.511 --> 11:21.889
Er, well, wind direction
is very complicated.

11:22.223 --> 11:23.057
And, uh...

11:24.392 --> 11:26.644
-Look!
-[Aunt Cora] Oh! Thank heavens.

11:29.063 --> 11:29.939
[they gasp]

11:30.022 --> 11:32.274
-[they scream]
-[rips]

11:33.609 --> 11:35.569
[all scream]

11:35.653 --> 11:36.612
[Aunt Cora] Oh, no!

11:37.196 --> 11:38.572
This is all my fault. I'm so sorry!

11:38.656 --> 11:39.698
Me too.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.661
-Wait, why are you sorry?
-Argh!

11:43.911 --> 11:44.912
[THUD]

11:49.166 --> 11:51.001
[Pru] Are you sure we're going
the right way?

11:51.502 --> 11:53.712
-Is this even the same cloud?
-Of course it is!

11:54.004 --> 11:55.381
It looks just like a hippo.

11:55.881 --> 11:56.882
Wait.

11:57.591 --> 11:59.343
That one looks even more like a hippo.

11:59.844 --> 12:01.887
Oh, what was all that cloud-watching for

12:01.971 --> 12:04.098
if I can't even tell one fluffy hippo
from another?

12:04.181 --> 12:06.767
-[squawking]
-[Abigail] It's Clancy!

12:07.768 --> 12:11.188
Ah, poor Clancy. He must've followed
the balloon all this way.

12:11.480 --> 12:14.108
You smart goose!
Did you see which way they went?

12:15.651 --> 12:16.694
They must be that way.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.664
-[Aunt Cora whimpers]
-[Lucky] Come on, Aunt Cora.

12:29.248 --> 12:30.249
It's easy.

12:30.666 --> 12:32.751
I have climbed a tree before.

12:32.835 --> 12:33.669
Really?

12:38.257 --> 12:39.758
-[rips loudly]
-[she screams]

12:39.842 --> 12:40.718
[Julian] Aunt Cora!

12:41.385 --> 12:42.761
-[Aunt Cora] Oof!
-[Lucky gasps]

12:43.387 --> 12:45.222
[Lucky] Quick! Before it falls more!

12:47.766 --> 12:48.601
Wow.

12:48.893 --> 12:51.812
-You're a natural, Aunt Cora.
-[Aunt Cora] Get me out of here.

12:52.396 --> 12:53.647
[whimpers]

12:54.273 --> 12:55.816
[Lucky grunts]

12:57.193 --> 12:59.528
-Aunt Cora!
-[Aunt Cora screams]

12:59.612 --> 13:00.863
[Lucky] Whoa!

13:01.447 --> 13:02.573
[Aunt Cora screams]

13:02.656 --> 13:04.658
[Julian] Don't worry, Aunt Cora.
We've got you.

13:06.994 --> 13:08.996
[Aunt Cora whimpers]

13:10.664 --> 13:12.416
Get me down. Please.

13:12.500 --> 13:15.252
Don't worry, Aunt Cora,
we'll have you right-side-up in no time.

13:17.087 --> 13:18.797
[Aunt Cora screams]

13:20.049 --> 13:21.967
-Nice of you to drop in!
-Ugh!

13:22.051 --> 13:23.928
[Aunt Cora] Thank you, Julian.
You're a hero.

13:24.011 --> 13:25.304
-Look out!
-[rips loudly]

13:25.387 --> 13:26.222
[Julian screams]

13:30.726 --> 13:32.561
-Are you OK?
-I'm fine...

13:33.270 --> 13:35.231
-I think.
-[Julian] She doesn't look too bad.

13:35.773 --> 13:39.401
Nothing a strong patch
and a fresh coat of paint won't... fix.

13:40.027 --> 13:43.531
Why, Aunt Cora,
you are positively glowing!

13:43.739 --> 13:45.699
I think this country air agrees with you.

13:45.866 --> 13:48.452
Ha. Yes, well, all the same,

13:48.953 --> 13:50.579
I would like to go home now.

13:50.829 --> 13:52.081
Which way is Miradero?

13:52.623 --> 13:53.499
I'm not sure.

13:53.582 --> 13:55.876
But I bet we could get a good look
from up there.

13:56.252 --> 13:59.421
Oh goodness. This is more adventure
than I had bargained for.

13:59.505 --> 14:02.466
Don't worry. I've been lost
on the frontier lots of times and--

14:02.550 --> 14:04.885
Well, I've never been lost
on the frontier before.

14:04.969 --> 14:08.514
What say we pop up to that high spot there

14:08.597 --> 14:10.474
and get the lay of the land?

14:10.558 --> 14:12.434
That sounds like an excellent plan.

14:15.646 --> 14:16.564
[Julian grunts]

14:21.360 --> 14:24.446
[Lucky] Leave the balloon, Julian.
It's slowing us down.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.240
We can come back for it!

14:26.866 --> 14:29.451
You're too young to understand
these things, R.F, but...

14:29.702 --> 14:32.079
you don't just walk away
from an investment.

14:32.162 --> 14:34.248
[Lucky] I'm a year younger than you!

14:35.875 --> 14:36.876
[Julian cries out]

14:38.544 --> 14:39.879
[Lucky gasps] Julian!

14:42.172 --> 14:43.465
[Julian] Argh!

14:44.133 --> 14:44.967
Let go!

14:45.885 --> 14:47.136
[Julian] I need a better grip.

14:50.472 --> 14:52.182
[they struggle]

14:55.185 --> 14:56.770
-[Lucky] Let go!
-[Aunt Cora] Julian!

14:58.606 --> 14:59.732
[Julian] No!

14:59.815 --> 15:00.816
[crashing]

15:02.860 --> 15:04.069
What am I going to do now?

15:04.361 --> 15:05.946
I'll never be able to repay...

15:08.657 --> 15:11.535
To repay your kindness
with another balloon ride home.

15:19.543 --> 15:21.170
-[Spirit snorts]
-What is it, Spirit?

15:21.253 --> 15:22.254
[Spirit whinnies]

15:23.005 --> 15:25.341
[man] Didn't plan on wasting my day
trudging through

15:26.050 --> 15:26.884
wherever we are.

15:28.802 --> 15:33.015
-I swear, when we find that Julian kid...
-We're gonna make him pay.

15:34.099 --> 15:35.517
What has Julian done this time?

15:35.643 --> 15:36.769
Make him pay?

15:37.311 --> 15:38.854
Eep! That sounds painful!

15:39.688 --> 15:41.357
So? Let them find him.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.025
Maybe he'd finally learn his lesson.

15:43.108 --> 15:44.735
But what if they hurt his beautiful face?

15:46.362 --> 15:47.821
I mean,

15:47.905 --> 15:50.074
but Lucky and Miss Prescott are with him.

15:50.908 --> 15:52.534
Then we're gonna have to slow them down.

15:55.037 --> 15:56.914
[Lucky] I'm pretty sure
we should go that way.

15:56.997 --> 15:58.040
Pretty sure?

15:58.332 --> 15:59.625
Good thing I remembered these.

16:10.219 --> 16:11.595
-That's the way home.
-Really?

16:11.679 --> 16:12.680
Let me see.

16:12.972 --> 16:16.892
-Hey! Those are mine!
-Enough of your childish behavior, Lucky.

16:17.267 --> 16:18.978
You got us into this situation.

16:19.269 --> 16:21.647
Thankfully,
Julian has been resourceful enough

16:21.730 --> 16:23.315
to figure out how to get us out.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.201
This feels wrong.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.579
Does it smell weird?

16:38.122 --> 16:39.540
Like rotten eggs?

16:40.082 --> 16:42.668
Ugh. The whole frontier smells odd.

16:42.751 --> 16:44.086
I don't smell a thing.

16:52.720 --> 16:56.557
[Lucky gasps]
Oh, no! These aren't puddles. Stop!

17:01.061 --> 17:02.146
[Aunt Cora screams]

17:05.733 --> 17:07.026
These are geysers!

17:07.276 --> 17:08.318
We have to go back.

17:08.527 --> 17:11.113
Come on, R.F., We can't turn around--
[screams]

17:11.739 --> 17:13.782
We have to!
It's too dangerous to keep going.

17:14.366 --> 17:17.453
[gasps]
Maybe Lucky is right.

17:18.704 --> 17:19.705
[they scream]

17:19.788 --> 17:21.874
-[Julian] Come on.
-[Lucky] Stop. Julian!

17:29.631 --> 17:31.508
-[Aunt Cora] Julian.
-Argh!

17:37.181 --> 17:38.182
[he screams]

17:41.560 --> 17:42.394
[she grunts]

17:42.895 --> 17:43.896
[Aunt Cora] Julian!

17:44.688 --> 17:46.065
Lucky, what do we do?

17:47.983 --> 17:49.818
-[Aunt Cora] Gah!
-[Lucky pants]

17:49.902 --> 17:51.487
We have to find solid ground to walk on.

17:57.242 --> 17:58.243
[Aunt Cora] Gah!

18:04.583 --> 18:06.376
This way. Follow me.

18:06.710 --> 18:07.795
Step where I step.

18:24.728 --> 18:26.063
[Abigail pants]

18:27.439 --> 18:28.315
Here they come!

18:28.732 --> 18:30.317
No way they're getting around that!

18:32.152 --> 18:33.028
[man] Tarnation!

18:34.029 --> 18:35.906
We'll have to circle
around the high trail.

18:36.573 --> 18:37.616
Going to take a good hour.

18:38.283 --> 18:40.410
I've had it with this kid.
Argh!

18:44.414 --> 18:45.249
Hm.

18:45.874 --> 18:48.377
Hm. Or... we could do that.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.380
They're going to get
to Lucky and Julian first.

18:51.463 --> 18:52.673
We have to do something!

18:55.217 --> 18:56.844
It's up to you now, Clancy.

18:57.344 --> 18:59.179
Do it for Miss Prescott!

19:00.055 --> 19:01.640
-[Clancy squawks]
-[both] Huh?

19:02.641 --> 19:04.017
[vroom]

19:05.602 --> 19:08.397
Whoa. Hey. Get off.
Get off. Get off me.

19:08.605 --> 19:09.982
Get it off me! Get it off me!

19:10.065 --> 19:11.108
[they shout out]

19:12.401 --> 19:13.235
[they groan]

19:18.282 --> 19:19.324
[second man] Uh!

19:19.408 --> 19:20.617
[man] Oh!

19:21.201 --> 19:22.161
Argh!

19:24.788 --> 19:25.998
Sorry, boy.

19:26.748 --> 19:27.791
Good job.

19:28.292 --> 19:29.293
[Pru's horse whinnies]

19:32.337 --> 19:35.424
I'm telling ya, R.F.,
we're going the wrong direction.

19:35.757 --> 19:38.093
Home was on the other side
of those geysers.

19:38.343 --> 19:39.261
We should go back.

19:40.137 --> 19:41.138
[Lucky] Hand them over.

19:44.141 --> 19:45.350
Uh, Julian!

19:45.809 --> 19:48.645
I was right. Miradero is this way.

19:48.729 --> 19:51.064
Why did you lead us
in the wrong direction?

19:51.356 --> 19:52.482
On purpose?

19:52.816 --> 19:54.651
I don't know what you're talking about,
R.F.

19:54.735 --> 19:57.446
-I think you do.
-[both] Aunt Cora?

19:57.529 --> 20:00.365
Julian, you've been intentionally
misleading us.

20:00.699 --> 20:02.284
And I'd like to know why.

20:02.492 --> 20:03.410
Yeah, me too!

20:05.245 --> 20:06.246
Here's the thing.

20:06.330 --> 20:07.998
When I saw the balloon in Cannon City,

20:08.081 --> 20:11.251
I knew I had finally found a way
to make a name for myself.

20:11.752 --> 20:14.546
-But--
-I knew it. There's a "but."

20:14.630 --> 20:17.341
-Let him continue.
-But I only had half the money.

20:17.716 --> 20:19.760
I could make the rest selling rides.

20:19.843 --> 20:21.220
The balloon would pay for itself.

20:21.845 --> 20:23.263
Go on.

20:23.388 --> 20:25.390
So I wrote a check for my future.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.935
A check that absolutely
would not have bounced

20:28.018 --> 20:29.811
if I had been able to sell rides.

20:29.895 --> 20:32.022
You wrote a check you couldn't honor?

20:32.105 --> 20:35.442
But then, Lucky inflated the balloon,
and the balloon men saw it,

20:35.525 --> 20:36.777
which is why we had to escape.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.111
So, I...

20:38.403 --> 20:40.948
uh, may have untied the tether line.

20:41.782 --> 20:44.743
How could I know the balloon sellers
would come looking for me so soon?

20:44.826 --> 20:47.496
I just needed a few more days
to earn the rest of the money.

20:47.579 --> 20:48.497
So this whole time,

20:48.580 --> 20:51.250
you've been blaming me
when it was your fault?

20:51.333 --> 20:52.584
Was it really though, Lucky?

20:52.793 --> 20:55.420
After all, you were the one
who took up the balloon without--

20:55.504 --> 20:59.549
Enough! You can't foist your scheming ways
on your cousin this time, Julian.

20:59.633 --> 21:01.969
You have no one to blame but yourself.

21:03.762 --> 21:05.013
I'm sorry, Aunt Cora.

21:06.098 --> 21:06.974
Sorry Lucky.

21:08.433 --> 21:09.977
Oh fine, I guess.

21:10.394 --> 21:11.436
I forgive you.

21:12.646 --> 21:14.189
And I'm sorry too, Lucky.

21:14.898 --> 21:16.358
I should've listened to you.

21:17.359 --> 21:18.527
[Spirit neighs loudly]

21:20.404 --> 21:22.322
-Clancy?
-Spirit!

21:23.824 --> 21:26.451
[Aunt Cora] Clancy. Ooh!

21:26.535 --> 21:28.537
-[Pru] Lucky!
-What's going on?

21:28.620 --> 21:30.872
We have to protect his beautiful face!

21:31.123 --> 21:31.999
We have to go.

21:32.416 --> 21:34.042
Oh, no! Too late! Run!

21:34.584 --> 21:35.919
[man] Now we got him, Julian.

21:36.420 --> 21:37.713
You little rascal.

21:37.796 --> 21:38.755
There you are.

21:38.839 --> 21:40.882
-You can't take him!
-No, take him.

21:41.216 --> 21:42.467
Just don't hurt the rest of us.

21:42.551 --> 21:43.427
We're innocent.

21:43.510 --> 21:47.139
You must be the gentlemen
my nephew has been eluding.

21:47.639 --> 21:48.473
Julian.

21:48.557 --> 21:51.852
I'm sorry my check bounced,
but it wouldn't've if, uh--

21:51.935 --> 21:52.936
Ahem.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.022
Er, sorry.

21:55.105 --> 21:59.234
Young man, you need to return the balloon,
or pay for it.

22:01.194 --> 22:04.239
Oh, you meant "make him pay"
as in make him pay.

22:04.823 --> 22:06.616
I will cover his debts

22:07.034 --> 22:07.951
and your trouble.

22:10.120 --> 22:14.541
-Thank you, ma'am.
-My nephew will pay me back every cent.

22:14.791 --> 22:15.876
With interest.

22:16.376 --> 22:17.461
For my trouble.

22:19.212 --> 22:21.923
Well, now that we're all together,

22:22.299 --> 22:23.300
let's go home.

22:23.675 --> 22:25.886
I suppose we have
quite a trek ahead of us.

22:28.472 --> 22:30.098
