Okay, yeah,
but I thought we were gonna,

02:33.736 --> 02:34.904
So, this is pretty simple.

02:34.988 --> 02:35.697
It's basically
just like bowling.

02:35.780 --> 02:37.866

just puked outside.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.840
Want to come see?

09:06.379 --> 09:09.840
Are you kidding? Of course
I want to come see.

09:09.924 --> 09:10.675
(Adam laughs)

09:14.178 --> 09:16.305
Oh, hey.

09:16.389 --> 09:17.473
♪ So, take my hand ♪

09:19.558 --> 09:21.269
♪ Let's go... ♪

09:21.352 --> 09:23.104
Hey, Dad.

09:21.352 --> 09:23.104
Hey, Danny.

09:23.187 --> 09:24.730
Can't believe
they're still doing

09:24.814 --> 09:25.815
the Winter Wassail.

09:27.066 --> 09:28.818
Well, uh, you want
to grab some food

09:28.901 --> 09:29.360
and come join us
in the corner?

09:29.443 --> 09:31.153
I'd, um,

09:31.237 --> 09:32.822
love for you to meet my fiancée.

09:32.905 --> 09:34.240
Oh.

09:34.323 --> 09:36.158
Yeah, yeah, of course.

09:36.242 --> 09:36.575
Well, see you over there.

09:38.911 --> 09:41.163
Were you actually
just being civil to Dad?

09:41.247 --> 09:42.498
Yeah, well,
while you were relaxing alone

09:42.581 --> 09:44.583
in your motel room,
I was trapped in the blizzard

09:44.667 --> 09:45.710
with him.

09:45.793 --> 09:46.544
And it was talk to him
or kill him.

09:48.754 --> 09:51.132
Danny says
that you're Sarah's friend.

09:51.215 --> 09:52.758
Yeah. Yes.

09:52.842 --> 09:55.511
We are, uh,
BFFs for life.

09:55.594 --> 09:57.263
(chuckles)
I'm just getting to know her,

09:57.346 --> 09:59.348
but she seems great.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.017
Oh, she's the greatest. She's,

10:01.100 --> 10:02.601
you know...

10:02.685 --> 10:04.103
Marry Danny Cooper, you get

10:04.186 --> 10:06.063
the world's greatest
sister-in-law

10:06.147 --> 10:07.315
in the package. It's...

10:07.398 --> 10:09.567
You-you hit the wedding jackpot.

10:09.650 --> 10:12.069
(laughs)
I-I'm a very lucky girl.

10:13.446 --> 10:14.739
Uh, Dad,

10:14.822 --> 10:15.740
this is Piper, my fiancée.

10:15.823 --> 10:17.366
Piper, this is
my dad, Paul.

10:17.450 --> 10:20.036
It is really nice to meet you.

10:20.119 --> 10:21.704
Well, I'm very excited
to meet this beautiful fiancée

10:21.787 --> 10:24.081
I've been hearing all about.

10:21.787 --> 10:24.081
(chuckles)

10:24.165 --> 10:24.749
I see where Danny
gets his charm.

10:27.335 --> 10:31.213
So, uh, Piper, um,
I know you live in New York.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.632
Tell me what it is that you do?

10:33.716 --> 10:35.301
I'm the CFO of a nonprofit

10:35.384 --> 10:37.803
called "Growing Hope
Transnational," and we provide

10:37.887 --> 10:40.431
crops and agronomy training to
farmers in developing nations.

10:40.514 --> 10:42.016
Well.

10:42.099 --> 10:43.225
"Teach a man to fish."

10:43.309 --> 10:44.769
PIPER:
Yes, exactly.

10:44.852 --> 10:47.104
Beauty, brains
and a heart of gold.

10:47.188 --> 10:48.773
Marry this girl.
Don't let her get away.

10:48.856 --> 10:51.442
I'm not going anywhere.
Don't worry.

10:51.525 --> 10:52.651
Hmm.

10:54.904 --> 10:57.031
SARAH:
<i>That was</i>

10:57.114 --> 10:58.240
a resounding success.

10:58.324 --> 10:59.992
You make a great
Christmas Captain.

11:00.076 --> 11:02.411
Yeah.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.205
Yeah, thanks for all your help.

11:04.288 --> 11:05.956
Hey, are you okay?
What's going on?

11:06.040 --> 11:07.750
You were
snippy earlier

11:07.833 --> 11:09.377
when we were setting up,
all night

11:09.460 --> 11:10.086
you looked like
you were seeing ghosts.

11:10.169 --> 11:11.670
No, I'm fine.

11:15.257 --> 11:16.258
Just, then,

11:16.342 --> 11:18.886
let me get you home
to Adam, okay?

11:18.969 --> 11:20.888
Okay.

11:18.969 --> 11:20.888
Come on.

11:22.014 --> 11:24.725
We can do the rest
tomorrow, Corinne.

11:29.271 --> 11:31.399
Corinne?

11:33.984 --> 11:35.277
(sniffles)

11:37.780 --> 11:39.323
I slept with Danny.

11:39.407 --> 11:39.657
What?

11:40.825 --> 11:43.744
I wasn't alone
during the blizzard.

11:43.828 --> 11:46.789
Danny was here with me, and...
we were together,

11:46.872 --> 11:49.125
and we were... together.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.293
(sniffles)

11:51.377 --> 11:53.087
I love Adam.

11:53.170 --> 11:58.676
He's sweet,
and he's attentive, and he...

11:58.759 --> 12:00.511
he's loyal.

12:00.594 --> 12:03.597
And he takes care of me
and supports me.

12:05.099 --> 12:07.935
But no one has ever made me
feel the way that Danny does.

12:08.018 --> 12:12.189
When I'm with him, I feel...

12:12.273 --> 12:14.442
beautiful and smart and strong.

12:14.525 --> 12:18.654
I feel like me. I feel like
the best version of me, and I...

12:20.823 --> 12:25.453
Hey, hey, hey.

12:20.823 --> 12:25.453
What am I gonna do?

12:25.536 --> 12:30.124
You made a mistake.
You made a mistake.

12:30.207 --> 12:31.792
It happens.

12:31.876 --> 12:33.794
Danny is a fantasy.

12:33.878 --> 12:38.507
Adam has done
nothing but adore you

12:38.591 --> 12:40.134
since the moment
that you met.

12:40.217 --> 12:43.721
You two have built an
amazing life together.

12:43.804 --> 12:46.891
He's the father
of your child.

12:50.895 --> 12:53.314
Adam is Josh's father, right?

12:54.190 --> 12:55.900
Corinne?

12:58.194 --> 12:59.737
Corinne?

13:06.118 --> 13:11.624
The night before Danny left
six years ago,

13:11.707 --> 13:14.168
we had sex,

13:14.251 --> 13:18.005
and we weren't very careful.

13:18.088 --> 13:21.217
And then he was gone.

13:21.300 --> 13:24.553
And then, a couple days later,
you and AJ and Grover took me

13:24.637 --> 13:26.388
to that party in Clarksville
to try to cheer me up.

13:26.472 --> 13:27.723
Yeah, I remember.

13:27.806 --> 13:29.642
That's where
you met Adam.

13:29.725 --> 13:31.769
I was drunk,
and I was desperate.

13:33.979 --> 13:36.065
I just...

13:36.148 --> 13:38.984
I wanted to feel affection.

13:39.068 --> 13:42.863
I needed... to feel loved again.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.990
So that night, I kissed Adam,

13:45.074 --> 13:49.662
and that night,
we slept together, and...

13:51.372 --> 13:53.749
It all happened so fast,
neither of us had a...

13:56.794 --> 13:58.921
And a month later,
I found out I was pregnant.

13:59.004 --> 14:02.424
So I told myself
that it was Adam's.

14:02.508 --> 14:05.594
It had to be.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.180
He was a great guy, and I knew

14:08.264 --> 14:10.599
he would be a good dad,
and I was right.

14:10.683 --> 14:13.060
But when I think about Josh...

14:13.143 --> 14:14.937
♪ I'll be home soon... ♪

14:15.020 --> 14:17.273
...and the idea that...

14:17.356 --> 14:19.400
that Danny could be his...

14:19.483 --> 14:22.444
Hey, stop,
stop. Don't.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.446
Don't do this.

14:24.530 --> 14:28.784
Fatherhood is not about DNA.
It's about showing up.

14:28.867 --> 14:31.036
If anyone knows that, it's me.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.871
♪ I'll be home soon... ♪

14:32.955 --> 14:34.957
And Adam has shown up.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.626
He is Josh's father
in every way that counts.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.837
♪ Give it all away... ♪

14:41.213 --> 14:43.048
You're right.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.343
Thank you for talking me
off the ledge.

14:46.427 --> 14:47.845
Come on, let's go.

14:47.928 --> 14:49.847
Okay.
Let's get you home.
Let's get you home.

14:49.930 --> 14:51.682
Come on.

14:49.930 --> 14:51.682
(laughs)

14:51.765 --> 14:54.018
Come on. Hey.

14:57.104 --> 14:57.855
Dig in. Got to fuel up
before skating.

14:58.981 --> 15:01.692
Actually, we are not
going skating.

15:03.110 --> 15:05.070
Where are we going?

15:05.154 --> 15:08.032
To meet a realtor.

15:08.115 --> 15:10.117
I found a few houses in town

15:10.200 --> 15:12.077
that I thought would be cool
to check out.

15:13.370 --> 15:14.788
In Greylock?

15:14.872 --> 15:18.667
Your job is here, your-your
sister and your dad are here.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.336
As of three weeks ago,

15:20.419 --> 15:22.254
(laughing): you're an
elected official here.

15:22.338 --> 15:25.007
I mean, you in Greylock and me
in New York was fine when it was

15:25.090 --> 15:27.343
just for a little
while, but...

15:27.426 --> 15:30.971
(laughing):
I know I'm just
springing this on you.

15:31.055 --> 15:33.182
And you can
totally say "no."

15:31.055 --> 15:33.182
(clears throat)

15:33.265 --> 15:34.892
I just thought
it might help us

15:34.975 --> 15:37.728
stay connected
while you're here.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.650
It sounds great.

15:42.733 --> 15:44.318
Yeah. Yeah,
it sounds great.

15:44.401 --> 15:46.737
(laughing):
Yeah? Wow. Oh, my gosh!

15:46.820 --> 15:47.655
Let's go look
at houses.

15:47.738 --> 15:50.532
Let's go look at houses.

15:50.616 --> 15:51.950
(clears throat)

15:50.616 --> 15:51.950
Cheers.

15:58.457 --> 15:59.958
No, honey.

16:00.042 --> 16:04.088
No, Dad, you haven't
eaten all day.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.008
(sighs)

16:08.092 --> 16:11.470
Listen, I was thinking maybe
I could take some of those boxes

16:11.553 --> 16:16.475
over to Alexis's hotel,
see if she wants anything.

16:16.558 --> 16:19.269
Did Alexis ask you to do that?

16:19.353 --> 16:22.731
What? No. She didn't
ask me to do anything.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.567
So you spoke with her?

16:25.651 --> 16:26.860
Bella,

16:26.944 --> 16:30.155
I don't want you seeing her.

16:30.239 --> 16:32.074
She's still my family, Dad.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.368
I wish
that she was still our family,

16:34.451 --> 16:37.913
but she has made it clear
that she doesn't want to be.

16:37.996 --> 16:40.958
So it's just
you and me now.

16:41.041 --> 16:43.752
We have
to help each other, okay?

16:43.836 --> 16:45.504
Here, have-have a seat.

16:45.587 --> 16:48.132
Sit down.

16:51.093 --> 16:52.928
I've been thinking.

16:53.011 --> 16:56.432
Maybe you should come home.
For good.

16:56.515 --> 16:58.058
You know, no more Cabot Hall,

16:58.142 --> 17:01.645
no more boarding school
six hours away.

17:01.729 --> 17:05.399
You come back to Greylock,
and-and we'll just be a family.

17:05.482 --> 17:06.817
What do you think?

17:13.365 --> 17:16.702
I give you, Rudolph the
Red-Nosed Rein-Beer,

17:16.785 --> 17:18.537
Luis's latest invention.

17:18.620 --> 17:20.664
Dark Irish stout topped
with whipped cream,

17:20.748 --> 17:23.375
crushed peppermint and
gingerbread antlers.

17:20.748 --> 17:23.375
Mm.

17:23.459 --> 17:25.753
It's Christmas in a glass.

17:23.459 --> 17:25.753
Mmm.

17:25.836 --> 17:27.963
I love Christmas.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.215
You sure about that?

17:28.047 --> 17:30.215
Mm.

17:30.299 --> 17:31.925
What is that supposed to mean?

17:32.009 --> 17:34.261
This is my second Christmas
without Patience.

17:34.344 --> 17:36.138
The holiday stuff
I used to love

17:36.221 --> 17:39.057
just... makes me sad now.

17:39.141 --> 17:43.312
I'm sorry for that. Really.

17:43.395 --> 17:46.023
But what does that have
to do with me?

17:46.106 --> 17:47.816
Your eyes.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.319
It's like looking in a mirror.

17:50.402 --> 17:51.653
I don't think you're
the Christmas fanatic

17:51.737 --> 17:53.238
you claim to be.

17:53.322 --> 17:55.908
I think you hate this
holiday as much as I do.

17:59.453 --> 18:02.790
(sighs)

18:02.873 --> 18:06.168
My dad used
to make Christmas so special.

18:06.251 --> 18:07.586
But...

18:07.669 --> 18:08.879
then he got sick.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.175
Uh, it's just easier

18:13.258 --> 18:15.219
to pretend things are okay
than to face the fact

18:15.302 --> 18:18.138
that Christmas
is never gonna be the same.

18:18.222 --> 18:22.518
But just so you know: you don't
have to pretend with me anymore.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.228
Hmm.

18:27.564 --> 18:28.398
(exhales)

18:30.275 --> 18:31.443
Sarah. Hi.

18:31.527 --> 18:32.694
Hi. Nice morning for a run.

18:32.778 --> 18:35.864
Actually, do you...
do you have a second?

18:35.948 --> 18:38.408
Yeah. Sure. What's up?

18:35.948 --> 18:38.408
Uh,

18:38.492 --> 18:40.160
did Danny tell you that
we're buying a house here?

18:40.244 --> 18:44.665
No, but makes sense,
I guess.
Yeah.

18:44.748 --> 18:48.544
The thing is, we looked
at a dozen places yesterday,

18:48.627 --> 18:52.172
and he... he kept finding
reasons not to like them.

18:52.256 --> 18:55.134
He nixed one place because
he said it was haunted.

18:55.217 --> 18:56.885
Oh, that's Fishman Lodge.
It is haunted.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.095
By who?

18:58.178 --> 18:59.638
Fishman.

18:59.721 --> 19:01.139
He was murdered
by his wife in 1814

19:01.223 --> 19:02.766
'cause she caught him in bed
with the local leech collector.

19:02.850 --> 19:05.185
Oh, charming.

19:05.269 --> 19:06.562
Anyway,

19:06.645 --> 19:10.440
do you know if anything's
going on with Danny?

19:12.985 --> 19:14.611
He has, like, a lot

19:14.695 --> 19:16.947
of really, really tough memories
in Greylock.

19:17.030 --> 19:18.115
Might be why
he's dragging his feet.

19:18.198 --> 19:21.034
But he's doing
so much better now.

19:21.118 --> 19:23.328
It really... It just...

19:23.412 --> 19:25.747
It feels like he's made peace
with so much of that stuff.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.583
I mean, maybe he was just having
an off day yesterday.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.251
I-I don't... I'm sure

19:29.334 --> 19:30.669
you guys will find a place
that you both like.

19:30.752 --> 19:32.754
Yeah, I hope so. (laughs)

19:32.838 --> 19:34.631
Ah, thank you.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.717
Yeah. Anytime.
Have a good run.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.010
Thanks.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.010
Bye.

19:38.093 --> 19:38.260
Bye.

19:41.680 --> 19:44.683
MAYA:
Okay, so are you ready
to, uh, resume your life

19:44.766 --> 19:46.518
as the Queen Bee
of Greylock High?

19:46.602 --> 19:50.147
Please. I was
a drone at best.

19:50.230 --> 19:51.982
I don't know.

19:52.065 --> 19:53.775
I miss hanging out
with you and Tyler.

19:53.859 --> 19:56.153
It really sucks that you guys
are building a country

19:56.236 --> 19:58.697
from scratch,
knowing I'm not involved.

19:58.780 --> 20:01.158
But I don't know.
The thing is,

20:01.241 --> 20:03.285
I'm not just coming back
to you guys.

20:03.368 --> 20:05.287
I'd be coming back to...

20:05.370 --> 20:08.248
Pennywise in father form?

20:05.370 --> 20:08.248
Yeah.

20:08.332 --> 20:11.293
I just had a lot more freedom
at boarding school.

20:11.376 --> 20:14.212
I picked my classes,
I picked my activities.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.381
That makes me feel
like a horrible daughter

20:16.465 --> 20:19.301
because he really
needs me right now.

20:19.384 --> 20:22.304
But he's also
really busy being...

20:22.387 --> 20:24.973
Pennywise in father form?

20:22.387 --> 20:24.973
Yeah. (laughs)

20:25.057 --> 20:27.309
Listen, I-I get it.

20:27.392 --> 20:29.478
You know, before
my mom got locked up,

20:29.561 --> 20:30.562
I had to take
care of her a lot.

20:30.646 --> 20:33.815
And it was really
hard sometimes.

20:33.899 --> 20:36.234
But when I moved here, I didn't
have to do that anymore,

20:36.318 --> 20:37.486
and I felt free, too.

20:37.569 --> 20:41.698
Whether you stay in Greylock
or you go back to Cabot,

20:41.782 --> 20:43.742
I've got your back.

20:43.825 --> 20:44.660
And I know
Tyler does, too.

20:44.743 --> 20:47.162
Thank you.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.292
What, so ruining Corinne's life
once wasn't enough for you?

20:52.376 --> 20:54.503
You needed to come back
and do it again?

20:54.586 --> 20:55.921
Sarah...

20:54.586 --> 20:55.921
I know

20:56.004 --> 20:57.381
that you guys slept together
the night

20:57.464 --> 20:58.256
of the blizzard.

20:57.464 --> 20:58.256
(door closes)

21:01.259 --> 21:02.886
I really, really hoped
I could avoid

21:02.970 --> 21:04.054
having this conversation.

21:04.137 --> 21:06.807
Discussing my brother's
sex life is, like,

21:06.890 --> 21:08.183
as appealing
as getting a root canal.

21:08.266 --> 21:10.435
Yet here you are, pulling teeth.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.437
You just can't help yourself,
can you?

21:12.521 --> 21:13.021
Okay, I'm not the one with
the impulse control problem.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.189
(chuckles)

21:14.272 --> 21:16.358
Danny, Corinne's a mess.

21:16.441 --> 21:17.776
Your fiancée
just asked me

21:17.859 --> 21:20.737
why you were acting so weird.

21:20.821 --> 21:22.280
I mean, come on, Danny.

21:22.364 --> 21:23.281
What the hell were you thinking?

21:23.365 --> 21:25.492
I wasn't. That's the point.

21:25.575 --> 21:27.285
It just... happened.

21:27.369 --> 21:29.121
Sex doesn't just happen.

21:29.204 --> 21:31.123
You know how I know that?

21:31.206 --> 21:33.709
Because I've never been
on my way to the grocery store

21:33.792 --> 21:38.005
and accidentally wound up
in the missionary position.

21:38.088 --> 21:40.048
It's not that simple, Sarah.

21:38.088 --> 21:40.048
You should've stopped it.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.174
I couldn't.

21:41.258 --> 21:42.175
Because you didn't want to.

21:42.259 --> 21:43.468
Because I love her.

21:47.305 --> 21:48.265
You don't love her, Danny.
(chuckles)

21:50.559 --> 21:51.643
You love what she represents.

21:52.811 --> 21:53.687
(chuckles softly)

21:53.770 --> 21:54.730
Oh, yeah? And what's that?

21:54.813 --> 21:56.273
Hope.

21:56.356 --> 22:00.318
Growing up,
Corinne was your safe haven.

22:00.402 --> 22:02.612
When things with Mom
were at their worst,

22:02.696 --> 22:04.072
she was the only person

22:04.156 --> 22:05.699
who could make you smile again
in the morning.

22:05.782 --> 22:08.243
I-I'm sure being with her
made you feel that way again.

22:08.326 --> 22:09.870
But that's not love, Danny.

22:09.953 --> 22:11.872
That's nostalgia.

22:11.955 --> 22:13.540
You have to stop living
in the past.

22:13.623 --> 22:15.417
You got to focus on the future,
future with someone

22:15.500 --> 22:17.878
who supports you
and cherishes you

22:17.961 --> 22:19.296
and shows up for you
when you need them.

22:19.379 --> 22:23.925
Piper is an amazing woman,
Danny.

22:24.009 --> 22:26.803
She deserves better
than this.

22:26.887 --> 22:29.848
You have to make things right
with her.

22:32.309 --> 22:35.479
(door opens, closes)

22:38.607 --> 22:40.358
(indistinct chatter)

22:43.862 --> 22:44.946
The hell is that?

22:45.030 --> 22:47.616
The answer to our
Christmas problems.

22:47.699 --> 22:51.286
You gonna poison Santa
with a strawberry daiquiri?

22:51.369 --> 22:53.663
No. Okay.

22:53.747 --> 22:56.958
All this...
holiday stuff bums us out

22:57.042 --> 22:59.461
because it reminds us
of the way our lives used to be.

22:59.544 --> 23:01.004
Mm-hmm.

22:59.544 --> 23:01.004
Old traditions
reopen old wounds.

23:01.088 --> 23:02.506
So it got me thinking.

23:02.589 --> 23:07.344
Maybe... it's time
to start new traditions.

23:07.427 --> 23:08.470
Such as?

23:07.427 --> 23:08.470
(inhales)

23:08.553 --> 23:11.723
A group dedicated
to ignoring the holidays.

23:11.807 --> 23:14.309
We'll call it the
Anti-Christmas Christmas Club.

23:14.392 --> 23:15.977
(laughs)

23:14.392 --> 23:15.977
(chuckles):
Listen,

23:16.061 --> 23:18.396
while everyone is baking
cookies and-and...

23:18.480 --> 23:20.315
singing carols
and basking in winter,

23:20.398 --> 23:22.400
we're gonna go
the opposite direction.

23:22.484 --> 23:23.610
Mm.

23:23.693 --> 23:24.069
Summertime.

23:24.152 --> 23:25.237
Exactly.

23:25.320 --> 23:28.323
The Anti-Christmas
Christmas Club

23:28.406 --> 23:30.325
is going to cook barbecues
and watch summertime movies

23:30.408 --> 23:34.579
and drink
fruity umbrella drinks.

23:35.789 --> 23:36.957
What do you think?

23:35.789 --> 23:36.957
Mm.

23:37.040 --> 23:39.251
I'm in. (chuckles)

23:37.040 --> 23:39.251
All right.
(chuckles)

23:39.334 --> 23:40.460
Now, talk to me
about summer movies.

23:39.334 --> 23:40.460
Okay.

23:41.628 --> 23:43.839
BELLA:
That's the last one.

23:43.922 --> 23:46.133
(Alexis sighs deeply)

23:47.217 --> 23:49.010
Lots of good memories in here.

23:50.262 --> 23:51.930
I guess I couldn't
blame your dad

23:52.013 --> 23:53.390
if he wanted to
burn them all.

23:53.473 --> 23:54.599
(sighs)

23:53.473 --> 23:54.599
(chuckles)

23:54.683 --> 23:56.852
I think he just
ran out of matches.

23:56.935 --> 23:59.062
Then... thank you

23:59.146 --> 24:02.524
for braving the potential
fire to bring me all this.

24:02.607 --> 24:04.568
Yeah. I needed
a break anyway.

24:04.651 --> 24:07.612
I swear, the more time
I spend with him,

24:07.696 --> 24:10.907
the more I'm inclined
to pass on his offer.

24:10.991 --> 24:13.535
To stay in Greylock? I thought
that's what you wanted.

24:13.618 --> 24:15.412
In a perfect
world. But...

24:15.495 --> 24:18.623
things over at
462 Lily Lane

24:18.707 --> 24:21.042
aren't exactly
perfect right now.

24:21.126 --> 24:23.712
He's beyond irrational.

24:23.795 --> 24:25.881
However bad things may be
with you and your dad right now,

24:25.964 --> 24:29.718
there won't be any "you and your
dad" at all if you run from him.

24:31.052 --> 24:34.306
I just... wish I could have
the freedom of Cabot

24:34.389 --> 24:37.225
while still keeping everything
I love in Greylock.

24:37.309 --> 24:41.062
(exhales) If that's what you
want, you should ask for it.

24:41.146 --> 24:43.315
Honestly.

24:43.398 --> 24:46.359
The reason that my marriage
with your father failed

24:46.443 --> 24:48.069
is that I never asked him
for what I wanted.

24:48.153 --> 24:52.490
Yeah, my dad's a pretty
open-minded guy for a boomer,

24:52.574 --> 24:55.285
but I don't think he would've
been down with a throuple.

24:55.368 --> 24:56.161
Oh.
(laughs)

24:56.244 --> 24:58.246
(chuckles)

24:56.244 --> 24:58.246
I meant

24:58.330 --> 24:59.623
emotionally.

24:59.706 --> 25:02.459
Your father
is a good man.

25:02.542 --> 25:04.502
I should have been
brave enough to share

25:04.586 --> 25:06.796
my truth with him. And then...
(inhales)

25:06.880 --> 25:09.132
(sighs)
even if we had broken up,

25:09.216 --> 25:10.258
we could've done it amicably.

25:10.342 --> 25:12.302
But, instead,
I acted like a coward

25:12.385 --> 25:14.804
and ran away to get

25:14.888 --> 25:15.597
what I wanted.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.432
If you go back
to Cabot,

25:17.515 --> 25:19.059
go because you want to be there,

25:19.142 --> 25:20.602
not because you're running
from your dad.

25:22.729 --> 25:25.732
You're braver
than that, Bell.

25:25.815 --> 25:26.483
You're braver than me.

25:32.989 --> 25:34.491
TYLER:
<i>I don't get why</i>

25:34.574 --> 25:36.451
you're so bummed out.
I mean, we went curling.

25:36.534 --> 25:40.205
We played broomball. I mean,
you just won the oldest...

25:40.288 --> 25:41.081
sled race in New England

25:41.164 --> 25:43.625
on a dinner tray.

25:43.708 --> 25:45.585
Winter's your bitch
now, basically.

25:45.669 --> 25:49.256
You look like you're
going to a funeral.

25:49.339 --> 25:50.298
I mean, not
literally.

25:50.382 --> 25:52.467
I don't know. I just...

25:52.550 --> 25:54.010
keep thinking about my mom

25:54.094 --> 25:55.887
and how Christmas was...
(sniffles)

25:55.971 --> 25:57.013
always a thing
that we did together.

25:57.097 --> 25:59.474
And I should be
really miserable this month,

25:59.557 --> 26:01.226
but I...

26:01.309 --> 26:03.520
You're not.

26:03.603 --> 26:05.355
No.

26:05.438 --> 26:06.523
Okay, what does it mean

26:06.606 --> 26:09.526
if I like my life
in Greylock more

26:09.609 --> 26:11.778
than I like
my life in L.A.?

26:11.861 --> 26:13.905
Does that make me
a really bad daughter?

26:13.989 --> 26:17.284
No. Just 'cause you're happy
doesn't make you a bad daughter.

26:17.367 --> 26:19.661
Besides, you write your mom,
like, every week, right?

26:22.372 --> 26:26.710
Well, when I first got here,
it was really easy.

26:26.793 --> 26:29.504
I sent her all kinds of letters.

26:29.587 --> 26:31.381
But, you know, the more time
I spend in Greylock,

26:31.464 --> 26:33.174
the more it feels like home

26:33.258 --> 26:35.510
and the less I know
what I'm supposed to say to her.

26:35.593 --> 26:37.345
'Cause, you know,
if I tell her

26:37.429 --> 26:39.514
that I hate it here,
she'll worry about me.

26:39.597 --> 26:41.182
But then if I tell her
I love it,

26:41.266 --> 26:42.684
it's like a slap in the face.
Like, "Look, Mom.

26:42.767 --> 26:44.561
Look how well I'm doing
without you."

26:44.644 --> 26:46.354
I don't know.
I just--

26:46.438 --> 26:47.397
I don't know what
to write these days.

26:47.480 --> 26:50.817
So I just fully...
(shudders)

26:50.900 --> 26:53.194
I fully stopped writing.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.197
I'll bring you a milkshake.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.245
(sighs)

27:03.496 --> 27:07.000
You should write your mom.

27:08.251 --> 27:10.295
You're Sarah's dad, right?

27:10.378 --> 27:12.005
Mm-hmm.

27:10.378 --> 27:12.005
You know,

27:12.088 --> 27:13.548
everyone says
you're a deadbeat dad

27:13.631 --> 27:16.051
who walked out on his family.

27:16.134 --> 27:18.011
Why the hell
would I listen to you?

27:18.094 --> 27:20.013
(scoffs softly)

27:20.096 --> 27:22.057
Um, I don't know your mother.

27:22.140 --> 27:23.725
But...
(inhales)

27:23.808 --> 27:25.268
I'm guessing that,
if she's in prison,

27:25.352 --> 27:27.187
she might've made
a few mistakes along the way.

27:29.981 --> 27:32.067
Most people,
when they screw up,

27:32.150 --> 27:33.735
their-their
first concern is,

27:33.818 --> 27:35.570
uh, how it's gonna affect them.

27:36.905 --> 27:39.407
Parents, it's a little
different, you know? (inhales)

27:39.491 --> 27:41.826
We just...
(exhales)

27:41.910 --> 27:45.246
close our eyes and squeeze
our hands together and...

27:45.330 --> 27:49.084
pray that whatever fire we might
have started doesn't burn you.

27:51.378 --> 27:53.254
Especially if we're
the kind of parent that...

27:53.338 --> 27:55.924
starts a lot of fires.

27:58.093 --> 27:58.885
Mm.

27:58.093 --> 27:58.885
(sniffles)

27:58.968 --> 28:00.762
Take it from
the deadbeat dad

28:00.845 --> 28:03.765
who left his family.

28:03.848 --> 28:04.974
Your mom will be thrilled

28:05.058 --> 28:08.395
to know that you're
doing well without her.

28:10.355 --> 28:12.190
(whispers):
I promise.

28:16.194 --> 28:17.987
Hi. Okay, I got your text.

28:18.071 --> 28:21.449
Um... it's not
what it looks like.

28:21.533 --> 28:24.202
Good. Because what it looks like
is you sent samples of DNA

28:24.285 --> 28:26.162
from Adam, Josh and Danny
to a company

28:26.246 --> 28:28.957
that does
24-hour paternity tests,

28:29.040 --> 28:31.292
and you used my name
and email address

28:31.376 --> 28:32.961
to hide it from your husband.

28:31.376 --> 28:32.961
Yeah.

28:33.044 --> 28:35.755

Bruce Willis saves the day.
