<i>But, Michelle, why would you</i>
<i>accept two dates to the prom</i>

20:45.010 --> 20:47.946
<i>without telling either boy</i>
<i>about the other?</i>

20:48.013 --> 20:51.617
<i>Because, Dad,</i>
<i>Luke is so sweet,</i>

20:51.683 --> 20:54.219
<i>but Brandon is so hot.</i>

20:54.286 --> 20:55.954

20:59.257 --> 21:00.759
all: Lame.

21:02.995 --> 21:07.099
In five, four, three, two--

21:07.165 --> 21:09.401
-Howdy, y'all. I'm Carly.
-I'm Sam.

21:09.468 --> 21:11.970
-And this is "iCarly."
-Back on the internet.

21:12.037 --> 21:13.839
Where nobody can tell us
what to do.

21:13.905 --> 21:15.907
Yeah, baby.

21:15.974 --> 21:18.410
And now, Carly will spell
the word "punctuality--"

21:18.477 --> 21:20.579
While Sam screams like
a girl in a horror movie

21:20.646 --> 21:22.848
about to be eaten by a monster.

21:22.914 --> 21:28.320

P-U-N-C-T-U-A-L-I-T-Y.

21:28.387 --> 21:31.523
-Nice job, Carls.
-Thank you, Sam.

21:31.590 --> 21:32.891
And now on "iCarly"--

21:32.958 --> 21:34.660
Some live music
from a new friend of ours

21:34.726 --> 21:36.028
who's amazingly talented.

21:36.094 --> 21:37.429
So let's get them out here.

21:37.496 --> 21:39.264
