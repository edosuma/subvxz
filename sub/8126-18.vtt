- Michael?

01:09.802 --> 01:11.770
Hey, ma,
have you seen Michael?

01:11.837 --> 01:14.238
Oh, Gloria,
you won't believe this.

01:14.306 --> 01:17.208
He and Archie
went out together.

01:17.276 --> 01:21.379
Mother, no.
Without adult supervision?
[ Chuckling ]

01:21.446 --> 01:24.415
Archie was out of cigars,
and he asked Mike...

01:24.483 --> 01:27.218
To take a walk with him
down to the store.

01:27.286 --> 01:29.688
Oh, Gloria,
it was wonderful.

01:29.755 --> 01:31.690
Archie was laughing.

01:31.757 --> 01:36.094
And he said he was taking a walk
with his favorite son-in-law.

01:36.162 --> 01:38.063
Daddy said that?

01:38.130 --> 01:41.632
And it's all thanks
to pee wee Reese.

01:43.803 --> 01:47.706
Who's pee wee Reese?
Oh, some football player.

01:49.141 --> 01:54.412
I think they called him pee wee
because he was a short stop.

01:56.215 --> 01:59.450
No, ma, that's "shortstop."
So the game was baseball.

01:59.518 --> 02:03.955
Oh, well, anyway,
Archie was having an argument
with Mr. mcnab...

02:04.023 --> 02:07.625
About who was
the best shortstop ever,

02:07.693 --> 02:11.730
and Mike said
that mcnab was wrong
and Archie was right,

02:11.797 --> 02:14.365
and that was the start
of a beautiful friendship.

02:14.433 --> 02:17.769
That's great,
but I wonder how long
it's gonna last.

02:22.708 --> 02:24.642
Keep away from me, meathead.

02:24.710 --> 02:27.411
Shutting the door in my face
is not gonna change things.

02:27.479 --> 02:30.448
Shutting the mouth
in your face might help.

02:30.515 --> 02:32.250
All right.
What's happened?

02:32.317 --> 02:35.019
What happened?
You wanna know what happened?
He saw what happened.

02:35.087 --> 02:37.355
I didn't see nothing.
Now stay off my back.

02:37.422 --> 02:40.625
How would you like it
if you were Tony?
Well, I ain't Tony.

02:40.692 --> 02:42.927
Tony who?
Tony vicino.

02:42.995 --> 02:46.965
The shoemaker? I thought
you went out to get cigars.

02:47.032 --> 02:49.834
That's right.
I went out just to do
a little peaceful shopping.

02:49.902 --> 02:52.403
With your favorite son-in-law.

02:52.471 --> 02:54.806
Stifle that.

02:54.874 --> 02:57.008
Why don't you admit it?
You saw it.

02:57.076 --> 02:59.778
I didn't see no muggin'.

02:59.845 --> 03:01.913
Tony mugged somebody?

03:01.981 --> 03:05.349
No, Edith.
Tony wasn't the mugger.
He was the "muggee."

03:05.417 --> 03:09.854
Yeah. Yeah,
and Archie was right there,
and he says he didn't see it.

03:09.922 --> 03:13.524
Archie, it is your duty
as a citizen to come forward
and be a witness.

03:13.592 --> 03:16.294
That's okay for students
and the unemployed,

03:16.361 --> 03:20.064
which in your case
is one and the same thing.

03:20.132 --> 03:24.535
I happen to be a working man.
I don't get paid if
I turn up for work absent.

03:24.603 --> 03:28.072
Oh, you hear that reasoning?
"I'll do the right thing
if they pay me."

03:28.140 --> 03:31.109
If you're a witness
in one of these things,
you know what you gotta do?

03:31.177 --> 03:33.178
Put on a shirt and tie.
You gotta go down to court,

03:33.245 --> 03:36.181
wait for that case
to be called up,
which who knows when.

03:36.248 --> 03:38.983
Then by the time it gets
called up, you forget
what you was gonna say,

03:39.051 --> 03:42.486
some lawyer makes a monkey
out of you, and it all
goes down on your record.

03:42.554 --> 03:45.089
So because of
a little inconvenience,
you don't want to get involved.

03:45.157 --> 03:48.392
Listen, let me explain something
to you, huh? Shut up!

03:48.460 --> 03:51.462
You hear that, Gloria?
What are you looking at?

03:51.530 --> 03:53.531
You see? That's how he
settles everything.

03:53.598 --> 03:57.268
Michael, calm down.
We don't know what's going on.
Tell us what happened.

03:57.336 --> 03:59.637
Archie and I
went into the deli--
just a minute.

03:59.705 --> 04:01.605
I'll tell it.
You better tell the truth.

04:01.673 --> 04:03.774
Forget the truth.
Listen to me.

04:05.845 --> 04:07.778
The two of us went down
to the deli, see?

04:07.847 --> 04:10.481
To get that six-pack
and some cigars for me.

04:10.549 --> 04:14.585
Now, this guy is yapping
so much about baseball
that I leave the shop,

04:14.653 --> 04:17.856
and I'm halfway down
the street, and I see
I'm all out of cigars.

04:17.923 --> 04:20.892
I left them on the counter
back there.
So I ran back to get them.

04:20.959 --> 04:24.095
Will you
let me tell the story?

04:24.163 --> 04:27.098
So he runs back to get them.

04:27.166 --> 04:29.868
So I'm standing there
on the street,
and all of a sudden, someone--

04:29.935 --> 04:33.104
I don't know who--
jumps Tony vicino,
the shoemaker,

04:33.172 --> 04:36.207
when he's closing up
his little joint
and steals his cash box.

04:36.275 --> 04:41.179
- Now, that's the story.
- Except that Archie was there,
and he saw the whole thing.

04:41.247 --> 04:44.448
Listen, my being there
don't prove nothing.

04:44.516 --> 04:46.450
I was in Italy during the war.

04:46.518 --> 04:48.786
That don't mean
I seen mussolini.

04:50.722 --> 04:53.758
That's right.

04:53.825 --> 04:57.828
Archie would've told us
if he'd seen mussolini.

05:01.433 --> 05:03.201
Don't help me, huh, Edith?

05:03.269 --> 05:06.637
Aren't you always the one
who's saying that
it's a jungle out there?

05:06.705 --> 05:09.640
It's gonna get worse
until somebody stands up
and says, "I saw."

05:09.708 --> 05:12.310
How can you be so certain
daddy saw the mugging?

05:12.378 --> 05:14.345
Will you stay out
of this, please?
Hold it.

05:14.413 --> 05:17.282
She's making sense.
A man ought to listen
to his wife.

05:17.349 --> 05:20.084
- Archie--
- dry up.

05:21.820 --> 05:23.888
Archie, you know you saw it!

05:23.956 --> 05:28.126
How do you know what I know?
You don't even know
what you know, schoolboy.

05:28.193 --> 05:31.062
That's what makes you
a meathead!
And you're a dumb polack!

05:31.130 --> 05:33.131
Huh?
Huh? You see?

05:33.198 --> 05:35.866
How does it feel when
the shoe's on the other foot?
Not too good, huh?

05:35.935 --> 05:37.868
You don't like it, huh?
It bothers you, huh?

05:37.937 --> 05:40.038
Well, you're a dumb polack!
[ Forced laughter ]

05:44.576 --> 05:47.211
You belong in a rubber room.

05:48.747 --> 05:50.681
He's sick.
You better put him to bed.

05:50.749 --> 05:52.683
Did you hear that?
Let me out of here.

05:52.751 --> 05:55.353
Archie,
what is this all about?

05:55.421 --> 05:57.455
Did you ever hear anything
like that in your life?

05:57.522 --> 06:00.758
Yeah, lots of times,
right here.

06:00.826 --> 06:02.793
He must've
learned it from you.

06:02.861 --> 06:04.996
Now, you stifle yourself.

06:05.064 --> 06:08.099
He's got some
hell of a nerve telling me
that I gotta be a witness.

06:08.167 --> 06:11.035
You can't be a witness
if you didn't see nothing.

06:11.103 --> 06:13.704
That's it, Edith. That's it.
Thank you very much.

06:13.772 --> 06:17.141
You're welcome, Archie.
But if you did see something--

06:17.209 --> 06:20.578
now, wait a minute.
Whose side are you
gonna be on?

06:20.645 --> 06:24.715
Yours, Archie. I know
you'll do the right thing.

06:24.783 --> 06:28.353
Just ask yourself,
what do you feel in your heart?

06:28.420 --> 06:30.855
Heartburn, Edith!

06:30.922 --> 06:33.757
Now find me some
bicarbonate soda.
Right away.

06:33.825 --> 06:36.961
I don't care
what you say, Michael.
It was a rotten thing to do.

06:37.029 --> 06:40.131
I'm sorry, all right?
I shouldn't have
said that to his face.

06:40.199 --> 06:42.867
- It was stupid
and uncalled-for.
- All right!

06:42.934 --> 06:45.036
I said I was sorry.
What more do you want?

06:45.104 --> 06:49.440
I'm sorry I said that to him,
and I'm sorry I was happy
when his face turned purple.

06:49.508 --> 06:52.410
All right, Michael.
I understand.
You lost your temper.

06:52.478 --> 06:55.146
But that's no reason
to call daddy a liar.

06:55.214 --> 06:58.582
Gloria, I'm telling you,
Archie saw Tony being mugged!

06:58.650 --> 07:00.584
You didn't see him
see it, did you?

07:00.652 --> 07:03.287
Well, no, but--
then don't go around
accusing people.

07:03.355 --> 07:06.024
You're not always right.
You could be wrong, you know.

07:06.091 --> 07:08.393
It is possible.
You could be wrong.

07:08.460 --> 07:11.529
Just once
I'd like to hear you say,
"I could be wrong."

07:11.596 --> 07:13.531
All right.
I could be wrong.
Good.

07:13.598 --> 07:15.400
But not this time.

07:15.467 --> 07:18.503
[ Phone ringing ]

07:18.570 --> 07:21.539
Hello!
Excuse me. Hello.

07:21.606 --> 07:24.808
Just a minute, please.
Daddy, it's for you!

07:24.876 --> 07:28.479
[ Archie ]
Who is it?
Mrs. vicino!

07:28.547 --> 07:32.350
Geez, I don't wanna talk to her.
Did you tell her I was here?
Take a message.

07:32.418 --> 07:34.552
I'm sorry, Mrs. vicino.
He can't speak to you
at the moment.

07:34.619 --> 07:37.555
May I please take a message?
Shh, shh, shh!

07:40.025 --> 07:42.427
Oh.

07:42.494 --> 07:44.595
Uh-huh.

07:44.663 --> 07:46.597
Uh-huh.

07:48.434 --> 07:50.668
All right, Mrs. vicino.
Yes, I'll ask him.

07:50.735 --> 07:53.171
Yeah. Okay. Bye-bye.

07:53.238 --> 07:55.573
- What? What? What?
- Daddy, Mrs. vicino
wants to know...

07:55.640 --> 07:58.109
When you're going
to the police station
and tell them what you saw.

07:58.177 --> 08:01.412
You put a lid on that,
little girl. I told you
I didn't see nothing.

08:01.480 --> 08:05.583
- Daddy, you're lying.
- How dare you say
your father is lying!

08:05.650 --> 08:09.087
Because Mr. vicino
said that you were there
and saw everything.

08:09.154 --> 08:11.755
[ Groans ]
Archie, is that true?

08:11.823 --> 08:15.526
Listen, how could that shoemaker
be sure of what he's seen,

08:15.594 --> 08:18.963
after he fell down
on the sidewalk
and bumped his noggin there?

08:20.466 --> 08:22.833
You saw, arch.
You saw.

08:22.901 --> 08:25.035
If I was you,
I couldn't live with myself.

08:25.104 --> 08:28.439
Well, you ain't
living with yourself.
You're living with me.

08:32.677 --> 08:36.780
Michael, I apologize.
You were right.
Daddy, you lied to us!

08:36.847 --> 08:40.049
Listen, it ain't lying
to try to protect
yourself and your family.

08:40.119 --> 08:42.052
What?
If anything happened to me,

08:42.121 --> 08:44.355
this meathead couldn't keep you
in bubblegum.

08:44.423 --> 08:46.357
Oh, come off that bull, arch.

08:46.425 --> 08:48.926
What could happen?
It was just an ordinary mugging.

08:48.994 --> 08:50.828
"An ordinary little mugging,"
that's all.

08:52.097 --> 08:54.098
What do you know?
I was there.

08:54.166 --> 08:57.701
You didn't see nothing.
I seen it.

08:57.769 --> 09:01.472
Suppose I was to tell you
that that was done by
two mugs in blue silk suits...

09:01.540 --> 09:05.209
Riding in the back
of a big sedan that comes
screeching up to the curb?

09:05.277 --> 09:07.345
Come on, arch.
What are you trying to hand us?

09:07.412 --> 09:09.647
That's right.
There was a big black,

09:09.714 --> 09:11.849
probably bulletproof Cadillac
or something.

09:11.916 --> 09:13.784
Big bulletproof Cadillac?

09:13.852 --> 09:16.320
That's right.
You was in the store,
and you never seen it.

09:16.388 --> 09:18.756
Daddy, are you
trying to tell us
they were gangsters?

09:18.823 --> 09:22.793
Listen, little girl,
did you ever stop to think
of the kind of a name vicino is?

09:22.861 --> 09:25.796
Tony vicino? Antonio vicino?

09:25.864 --> 09:29.367
That's a nice name, Archie.

09:29.434 --> 09:31.369
It's musical.

09:31.436 --> 09:34.605
¶ Antonio vicino ¶

09:34.673 --> 09:38.342
stop that. Stop that.
Stop that. Stop that!
Stop that! Stop that!

09:43.148 --> 09:45.949
What I'm trying
to tell you is...

09:46.017 --> 09:49.720
That that is an Italian name--
vicino.

09:49.788 --> 09:52.890
It's worse than that.
It's a sicilian-Italian name.

09:52.957 --> 09:55.926
Are you trying to tell us that
the mafia is mixed up in this?

09:55.994 --> 09:59.897
Bingo, buddy. That's what
I'm trying to protect
me and my family against.

09:59.964 --> 10:03.668
I wanna tell you something.
Them sicilians
is famous for two things--

10:03.735 --> 10:06.837
spaghetti and revenge.
<i>[ Doorbell buzzing ]</i>

10:06.905 --> 10:10.140
Don't answer that door.
Get away from that door.

10:10.209 --> 10:12.142
I don't want you
talking to nobody.

10:12.211 --> 10:14.144
Now, stay over there.

10:16.147 --> 10:18.649
Mr. bunker?
Aw, geez.

10:18.717 --> 10:22.886
Listen,
I know what you're here for,
and I didn't see nothing.

10:22.954 --> 10:26.190
May I come in?
I'd just like to ask you
a few questions anyway.

10:26.258 --> 10:28.726
All right.
If you wanna, come on.

10:28.793 --> 10:31.962
I'll tell you up front
that I ain't no--

10:32.030 --> 10:34.532
what do you call--
a witness to that there event.

10:34.600 --> 10:38.836
That's right, officer.
Archie said he didn't
see no muggin'.

10:38.903 --> 10:40.838
He didn't see nothin',

10:40.905 --> 10:44.875
except a big
bulletproof Cadillac
from the mafia.

10:44.943 --> 10:46.877
Aw, geez!

10:49.748 --> 10:52.049
I think maybe
you'd better come with me
down to the precinct...

10:52.117 --> 10:54.918
And make a complete statement
to the detectives.

10:54.986 --> 10:58.556
Wait a minute, officer.
I'll tell you how
I couldn't have see nothin'.

10:58.624 --> 11:00.858
The mugger
was over here, see?

11:00.925 --> 11:02.926
I'm facing

11:02.994 --> 11:04.928
You're facing
in that direction.
That's right.

You know, like they say,
position is
nine-tenths of the law.

11:12.103 --> 11:14.037
Huh?
Yeah.

11:14.105 --> 11:17.475
See, the reason I'm doing that
is there's a wind
coming from this way.

11:17.542 --> 11:20.511
I'm standing facing this way
so I can light one of my cigars.

11:20.579 --> 11:23.981
Back here you said you
were out of cigars.
So what were you lighting?

11:24.048 --> 11:26.484
- Who said I was out of cigars?
- You did, arch.

11:26.551 --> 11:28.753
You told them
I went to get the cigars.

11:36.861 --> 11:39.029
You wanna get your coat,
Mr. bunker?

11:44.169 --> 11:46.671
Archie will be right back,
Mr. vicino.

11:46.738 --> 11:48.673
Sit down, won't you?

11:48.740 --> 11:51.709
Oh, Archie will be
so glad you're here.

11:51.777 --> 11:56.414
He was at the police station
last night for three hours.

11:56.481 --> 11:58.982
What a guy, huh?
A person like your Archie...

11:59.050 --> 12:01.819
Makes you feel real good
to belong to the human race.

12:01.886 --> 12:04.789
Yeah, maybe one of these days
we'll get him to join it.

12:06.458 --> 12:10.761
Nah, you young fellows
can take a lesson
from Mr. bunker. Get involved.

12:13.732 --> 12:18.402
I suppose that's why daddy took
so long at the police station,
'cause he was so involved.

12:18.470 --> 12:23.974
Oh, sure.
He said the police made him look
through 15 books of pictures,

12:24.042 --> 12:26.444
but none of them looked
like the two men.

12:27.579 --> 12:30.013
Two men?
In silk suits.

12:30.081 --> 12:33.451
- And a big car.
- What big car?

12:33.518 --> 12:35.453
Is that what he told the cops?

12:35.520 --> 12:39.590
[ Blubbers ]
It's as cold out there
as a well-digger's butt.

12:39.658 --> 12:41.592
Hey, bunker.

12:44.295 --> 12:47.665
- Vicino, what are you
doing here?
- Mr. vicino came over...

12:47.733 --> 12:50.300
To thank you
for going to the police.

12:50.369 --> 12:53.404
Oh. Well,
I'm glad for your--
what do you call--

12:53.472 --> 12:57.140
gratification and all that,
but I was only doing my duty.

12:57.208 --> 12:59.943
And drop in some other time.
Now, wait a minute.

13:00.011 --> 13:04.415
What's this about
a big car and two guys?
There was only one guy.

13:04.483 --> 13:07.084
Hey, what did you say?
He said he was just leaving.

13:07.151 --> 13:09.854
No, wait a second.
No car? Just one guy?

13:09.921 --> 13:12.556
No car.
Just one lousy punk.

13:12.624 --> 13:16.460
Here. I'll show you.
He comes around behind me
and grabs me like this, see?

13:16.528 --> 13:18.662
Yeah.
I can see
his leather jacket,

13:18.730 --> 13:20.698
but I can't see his face.

13:20.766 --> 13:25.168
But I can see bunker
standing there, staring
right at me and the mugger.

13:25.236 --> 13:28.138
- Then you did see it.
- You stay out of this.

13:28.206 --> 13:30.173

or something, huh?

13:30.241 --> 13:32.175

13:32.243 --> 13:34.578
You saw.
I know you saw.

Aw, you ain't got
no witnesses to that.

13:41.720 --> 13:44.755
Oh, why are you
dragging him into this?

13:45.990 --> 13:47.991
He sees everything.

13:48.059 --> 13:50.861
He knows everything we do.
Get out of here.

13:50.929 --> 13:52.996
You don't really
believe that.
Yes, I do!

Then how come youse people
are always running
to confession,

13:55.667 --> 13:57.601

14:05.677 --> 14:09.079
- Daddy, you shouldn't say that.
- No, let him.

14:09.147 --> 14:11.715
Let him.
Now we're getting the truth.

It's because I'm catholic
that you ain't helping me.

for the mafia.

I just dropped by to tell you...

22:45.863 --> 22:50.000
That that organization
which you mentioned
this morning in the paper,

22:50.068 --> 22:52.002
it don't exist.

22:52.070 --> 22:55.705
It's defunct.
Well, listen,
anything you say.

22:55.773 --> 22:57.941
We don't say that word.

22:58.009 --> 23:00.277
It's not a very nice word.

23:00.345 --> 23:02.645
You see, even in this movie,
the godfather,

23:02.713 --> 23:06.350
which is about that
defunct organization,

23:06.417 --> 23:08.352
even they don't use that word.

23:08.419 --> 23:11.821
I know the word. "Mafia."

23:13.491 --> 23:17.327
Lady, lady, even the FBI
don't use that word.

23:17.395 --> 23:19.762
You know what the FBI
calls organized crime?

23:19.830 --> 23:21.764
Organized crime.

23:23.267 --> 23:25.268
A better word.

23:25.336 --> 23:27.404
In that statement I made
to the police there,

23:27.472 --> 23:30.673
I didn't use no words
like "kosher nostras," see?

23:30.741 --> 23:33.643
Or that other mmm word.

23:33.711 --> 23:35.979
I ain't never gonna use
them words no more.

23:36.047 --> 23:37.981
Good, bunker.
That's all I wanted to know.

23:38.049 --> 23:40.317
I gotta go.
The wife and kids
are waiting in the car.

23:40.385 --> 23:43.953
Bye-bye, everybody.
[ Stammers, laughs ]

23:44.022 --> 23:46.823
Hey, by the by, the cop--

23:46.891 --> 23:50.827
you mentioned something
about a year in the can
and 500 bananas.

23:50.895 --> 23:53.163
That ain't gonna make you
change what you just said?

23:53.231 --> 23:55.365
No, no, no.
I told the truth just now.

23:55.433 --> 23:57.600
I mean,
I was honest this time.

23:57.668 --> 24:00.237
Good, bunker.
It pays to be honest...

24:00.304 --> 24:02.972
All the time.

24:03.041 --> 24:06.743
And remember, you heard it
from silvestri, huh?

24:06.810 --> 24:09.312
Bye-bye,
every beautiful people.

24:17.555 --> 24:20.757
Hey, Michael, you don't
really think the police
will put daddy in jail...

24:20.824 --> 24:22.759
For making
a false statement, do you?

24:22.826 --> 24:25.162
- I don't know. It's hard to s--
- <i>[ Gloria ] Daddy!</i>

24:25.229 --> 24:28.631
Archie, what happened?
They're not gonna put you
in jail, are they?

24:28.699 --> 24:31.234
What are you talking about,
put me in jail?

24:31.302 --> 24:33.836
Gee. They ain't even
gonna press no charges.

24:33.904 --> 24:36.506
That's wonderful.
Oh, good.

24:36.574 --> 24:39.109
- What happened?
- Oh, nothing much.

24:39.177 --> 24:41.344
You know that guy silvestri
that was here?

24:41.412 --> 24:43.547
Turned out
to be a pretty nice guy.

24:43.614 --> 24:46.450
Down at the station house
he put in a good word for me.

24:46.517 --> 24:50.554
Was it a five-letter word
beginning with "m"?

24:54.258 --> 24:58.761
You're a pip, Edith.
You know that? A real pip.

25:16.447 --> 25:20.484
