00:01.293 --> 00:02.670
Previously
on When Calls the Heart...

00:02.711 --> 00:04.171
[Abigail] Do you have
an idea for your first story?

00:04.212 --> 00:05.673
Rosemary LeVeaux!

00:05.714 --> 00:08.049
How would you like
to become a movie star?

00:08.091 --> 00:09.969
[Hickam] A half-a-dozen
of our trees are spiked.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.010
Roy left a while ago.

00:11.052 --> 00:12.554
Roy's the only man
I've ever loved.

00:12.596 --> 00:14.682
I'm looking for Becky
and Cody Hastings.

00:14.723 --> 00:16.016
I'm their aunt.

00:17.559 --> 00:18.435
I didn't know

00:18.477 --> 00:19.979
that Becky and Cody
had an aunt.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.647
They don't either.

00:21.689 --> 00:22.731
At least not yet.

00:22.773 --> 00:25.066
My sister, Lydia,
and I lost touch.

00:25.108 --> 00:26.067
Years ago.

00:26.109 --> 00:28.069
Lydia was their mother?

00:28.111 --> 00:30.071
My parents disowned her
when she eloped.

00:30.113 --> 00:32.407
I was in Paris

00:32.449 --> 00:34.075
when I heard the news
from a friend

00:34.117 --> 00:35.870
that Liddie and her husband
were killed.

00:35.911 --> 00:38.163
An automobile accident.

00:38.205 --> 00:40.081
I got home
as fast as I could.

00:40.123 --> 00:41.959
How did you know
the children were here?

00:42.001 --> 00:43.084
I hired
an investigator.

00:43.126 --> 00:44.503
I can't thank you enough

00:44.545 --> 00:46.087
for all you've done
for the two of them.

00:46.129 --> 00:49.048
I was happy to do it.

00:51.010 --> 00:53.136
I can see
the family resemblance.

00:53.178 --> 00:55.096
Becky has your smile.

00:55.138 --> 00:57.641
Well, she'll be smiling
a lot from now on.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.101
I'm going to give
those children

01:00.143 --> 01:01.228
everything
they've missed,

01:01.269 --> 01:03.146
everything my sister

01:03.188 --> 01:04.439
would have wanted
them to have.

01:04.481 --> 01:06.358
They're going to love
living in Davenport.

01:07.359 --> 01:10.111
You're taking them
to live in Davenport?

01:10.153 --> 01:11.196
Of course.

01:11.238 --> 01:12.865
I'm their only
living relative.

01:12.907 --> 01:14.408
But you don't
even know them.

01:14.449 --> 01:15.993
They're my sister's
children.

01:16.035 --> 01:17.578
That's all
I need to know.

01:17.619 --> 01:19.120
My husband and I have
an estate on the lake.

01:19.162 --> 01:22.165
There's plenty of room.

01:24.501 --> 01:26.545
You didn't think
they would be staying here?

01:26.587 --> 01:29.548
I don't know
what to think right now.

01:31.842 --> 01:32.968
Well...

01:33.010 --> 01:35.303
I need to check
into my hotel.

01:36.346 --> 01:37.848
When can I meet
the children?

01:37.890 --> 01:39.934
They've left for school.

01:39.975 --> 01:41.393
Then I'll come back tonight?

01:41.435 --> 01:43.144
Yes.

01:43.186 --> 01:44.354
That would be fine.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.607
Mrs. Connors.

01:46.648 --> 01:48.149
Oh. Carolyn.

01:48.191 --> 01:50.903
Maybe I should tell
the children that you're here,

01:50.945 --> 01:52.362
and taking them to Davenport.

01:52.404 --> 01:55.115
Whatever you think is best.

01:57.076 --> 01:58.953
[♪♪♪]

01:58.994 --> 02:00.079
What's going on?

02:00.120 --> 02:01.580
We're conducting
a lawful search.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.164
I'm going to have to
ask you not to interfere.

02:03.206 --> 02:06.001
I demand to know
what you're looking for.

02:06.043 --> 02:08.045
For these.

02:08.087 --> 02:09.296
Tree spikes,

02:09.337 --> 02:10.923
used to sabotage
Coulter's mill.

02:10.965 --> 02:13.174
I've never seen those before.

02:13.216 --> 02:15.970
You're gonna have to
come with me, Mayor.

02:16.011 --> 02:17.262
I'm placing you
under arrest.

02:22.768 --> 02:23.727
[Jack] Keep moving.

02:26.105 --> 02:28.565
[♪♪♪]

02:47.501 --> 02:49.044
[Jack] That's
a promissory bond.

02:49.086 --> 02:50.796
It means you agree
to appear in court.

02:50.838 --> 02:54.215
The two of you so blind that
you can't see I'm being framed?

02:54.257 --> 02:55.759
We know what we found
in your car.

02:55.801 --> 02:58.219
You'll do just about anything
to get between me and Nora.

02:58.261 --> 03:00.014
This isn't personal, Henry.

03:00.055 --> 03:01.056
Nora and I are divorced now.

03:01.098 --> 03:02.724
What she does
is her own business.

03:02.766 --> 03:04.768
Forgive me
if I find that hard to believe,

03:04.810 --> 03:06.227
given our current situation.

03:06.269 --> 03:08.396
I will always
care for her welfare,

03:08.438 --> 03:11.692
but that has nothing to do
with what's going on here.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.401
I didn't spike those trees.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.612
Then you'll tell it
to the judge, Henry.

03:20.617 --> 03:21.618
[door slams]

03:21.660 --> 03:23.537
[Rip whimpers]

03:23.578 --> 03:25.706
[Elizabeth] Don't you want
to go outside for recess?

03:25.747 --> 03:28.667
[Becky] I want to work on
my project for the competition.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.585
But a little fresh air
might do you good.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.253
And you need to at least
stretch your legs

03:32.295 --> 03:34.255
so you can build up
the strength to walk again.

03:34.297 --> 03:36.800
It's just
I really want to win.

03:36.842 --> 03:39.761
I never dreamed I'd get
a chance at a scholarship.

03:40.971 --> 03:42.931
How about
a five-minute break?

03:42.973 --> 03:44.432
Then you can come
right back inside.

03:44.474 --> 03:46.267
Okay.

03:46.309 --> 03:47.561
Okay.

03:49.980 --> 03:51.857
You know something?

03:51.899 --> 03:52.983
What?

03:54.275 --> 03:56.987
I think your father would be
very proud of you.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.076
I'm worried
you're doing too much.

04:02.117 --> 04:03.035
I'm used to hard work.

04:03.077 --> 04:04.119
Just the same,

04:04.161 --> 04:05.495
you have to take
care of yourself.

04:08.498 --> 04:10.042
Where's Oliver?

04:10.084 --> 04:11.960
I left him with
a friend, back at camp.

04:13.712 --> 04:15.005
Everything okay?

04:17.257 --> 04:19.885
I don't want
to sound ungrateful.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.053
You've helped a lot
of people at camp,

04:21.095 --> 04:23.889
including me, but...

04:23.931 --> 04:27.308
I never asked you
to talk to Roy.

04:27.350 --> 04:29.186
After you did,
I thought,

04:29.228 --> 04:31.063
"Maybe this will do
some good."

04:31.105 --> 04:34.233
But all it did was
get my hopes up for nothing.

04:34.274 --> 04:37.485
I think he'll come around.
He just needs some time.

04:37.527 --> 04:38.987
Please.

04:39.029 --> 04:42.282
You really don't need
to do anything else.

04:46.327 --> 04:51.166
[♪♪♪]

04:55.921 --> 04:57.714
[sighs heavily]

04:57.756 --> 04:59.133
I think
I've messed up.

04:59.174 --> 05:01.885
She just doesn't want
to get hurt again.

05:01.927 --> 05:03.053
I know Roy still
cares about her,

05:03.095 --> 05:04.179
I just don't know
what I can say to him

05:04.221 --> 05:05.346
to get him
to come around.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.891
Well, sometimes,
it takes more than words.

05:09.768 --> 05:12.395
Yeah, sometimes it does.

05:17.025 --> 05:18.235
You know,
I can't believe

05:18.277 --> 05:19.778
how lucky I was
to find you.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.447
Well, I can't believe
how lucky I was to be found!

05:22.489 --> 05:25.575
Rosemary, I really am
one of your biggest fans,

05:25.617 --> 05:27.410
and you are more
beautiful in person

05:27.452 --> 05:28.453
than you are on stage.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.872
You don't have
to say that.

05:30.914 --> 05:34.626
Um, you should know
the reason I came here

05:34.668 --> 05:36.377
was to shut down this picture.

05:36.419 --> 05:37.378
Why?

05:37.420 --> 05:39.047
Our star quit.

05:39.881 --> 05:40.924
[whispers]
Mary Medford?

05:40.966 --> 05:43.635
Griffith offered her
a three-picture deal

05:43.677 --> 05:45.262
and doubled her salary.

05:47.430 --> 05:50.642
But instead of shutting down
the picture,

05:50.684 --> 05:53.394
I would like for you
to take over her role.

05:53.436 --> 05:54.938
Excuse me? What--

05:54.980 --> 05:57.398
Did you just ask me to star...

05:57.440 --> 05:59.067
in The Reluctant Bride ?

05:59.109 --> 06:00.568
I know it's a gamble,

06:00.610 --> 06:03.155
but I've seen you on stage,
Rosemary, and I know talent.

06:03.197 --> 06:05.448
With the right
opportunity, my dear,

06:05.490 --> 06:07.492
you could have quite a career.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.953
[giggling]

06:12.455 --> 06:13.665
I talked
to Jack about it.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.251
Carolyn Connors
is their next of kin.

06:16.293 --> 06:18.003
Legally, there's
nothing I can do.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.005
Yeah, I didn't think so.

06:22.216 --> 06:23.717
How am I going to
explain it to them?

06:23.758 --> 06:27.221
Well, honesty is usually
the best policy.

06:27.262 --> 06:29.639
They were just starting
to do so well here.

06:29.681 --> 06:30.974
Well, there's no doubt

06:31.016 --> 06:33.227
you made a huge difference
in those kids' lives.

06:33.268 --> 06:34.853
You took 'em in,

06:34.895 --> 06:38.439
you cared for them
when they needed you most,

06:38.481 --> 06:41.818
but is living with their aunt
really so bad?

06:41.860 --> 06:43.444
I didn't say
she was a bad person.

06:43.486 --> 06:44.529
Well, everything
you've said,

06:44.571 --> 06:46.656
she sounds like
a very good person.

06:46.698 --> 06:50.409
Sounds like she can offer
a very nice life.

06:51.494 --> 06:52.746
I know,

06:52.787 --> 06:54.998
and I'm happy for them.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.458
It's just hard to let go.

06:57.500 --> 07:01.462
Well, the more you fight it,
the harder it's going to be--

07:01.504 --> 07:03.422
both for you
and for the kids.

07:04.507 --> 07:06.218
Are you gonna tell me
to "pray for strength"?

07:06.260 --> 07:07.468
[chuckles]

07:07.510 --> 07:09.388
I figure you already have.

07:13.683 --> 07:15.476
[♪♪♪]

07:15.518 --> 07:17.979
I can't believe
you arrested Henry Gowen.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.689
Evidence says
he's guilty,

07:19.731 --> 07:21.482
but I'm not so sure.

07:21.524 --> 07:22.650
Ooh.

07:22.692 --> 07:25.153
That's a great twist
for my story.

07:26.196 --> 07:28.740
Henry Gowen
is in your story?

07:28.782 --> 07:30.533
Well, he is
the mayor.

07:30.575 --> 07:32.744
Right.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.289
So... am I
in your story?

07:36.748 --> 07:39.709
There is a Mountie
named Theodore.

07:39.751 --> 07:41.502
Tell me about Theodore.

07:41.544 --> 07:42.921
He's hard to describe.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.839
Perhaps I could read
what you've written.

07:44.881 --> 07:45.882
I haven't quite finished yet.

07:45.924 --> 07:47.008
Tell you what.

07:47.050 --> 07:48.760
You let me read
what you have so far,

07:48.802 --> 07:50.887
and I will cook you dinner
tonight.

07:50.929 --> 07:52.513
You drive a hard bargain.

07:52.555 --> 07:55.100
Seven P.M., your place.

07:55.142 --> 07:58.853
And I bet I'm a better cook
than Theodore.

08:00.272 --> 08:01.689
[slams door]

08:01.731 --> 08:03.608
Jesse?

08:03.650 --> 08:05.944
Jesse!

08:07.570 --> 08:09.530
What's wrong?

08:09.572 --> 08:11.032
Yost let me go.

08:11.074 --> 08:13.827
Says he has to cut back
since the sawmill's shut down.

08:13.868 --> 08:15.495
I'm so sorry.

08:15.536 --> 08:17.205
Sorry doesn't fix anything.

08:17.247 --> 08:18.373
I just meant--

08:18.415 --> 08:19.833
You do something good
for these people,

08:19.874 --> 08:21.668
they don't care.

08:21.709 --> 08:23.503
It's happening to everyone.

08:23.544 --> 08:25.505
It shouldn't happen to me.

08:26.631 --> 08:29.550
But I guess that's what you get
around here for being a hero.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.552
Jesse, wait.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.724
[♪♪♪]

08:36.766 --> 08:39.560
I ordered
a new blade for the head saw,

08:39.602 --> 08:43.064
but factory says it's gonna be
a few weeks before it gets here.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.899
I want you to look into

08:44.941 --> 08:47.610
trying to give the crew
an advance on their pay.

08:47.652 --> 08:48.736
We need to find

08:48.778 --> 08:50.697
a way to help them
through this, if we can.

08:50.738 --> 08:52.740
Your heart's in
the right place, Mr. Coulter,

08:52.782 --> 08:54.201
but I'm just not sure
you have the cash.

08:54.242 --> 08:56.577
I know. Just try
and figure it out, okay?

08:56.619 --> 08:57.662
I'll see what I can do.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.873
Thank you.

09:04.127 --> 09:05.420
Oh...

09:05.462 --> 09:08.548
that's not the face
of a happy man.

09:08.589 --> 09:10.425
I know shutting down the sawmill
hasn't been easy for you.

09:10.467 --> 09:11.885
Seeing you helps a lot.

09:11.926 --> 09:14.637
How is it that,
even when you're not yourself,

09:14.679 --> 09:16.431
you still know
exactly what to say?

09:16.473 --> 09:19.559
Well, I'm not completely
without charm, you know.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.186
I have some amazing news.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.812
Okay.

09:22.854 --> 09:24.398
The producer
of the movie

09:24.439 --> 09:25.606
has just asked me

09:25.648 --> 09:29.277
to replace Mary Medford
in the picture.

09:29.319 --> 09:30.611
Wow!

09:30.653 --> 09:33.198
That's, uh...
that's great.

09:34.574 --> 09:35.992
But you're not happy.

09:36.034 --> 09:38.619
No. I-I-- I am,
I'm happy, I'm very happy.

09:38.661 --> 09:39.787

09:39.829 --> 09:41.622
I'm worried about you.

09:41.664 --> 09:45.252
Well, that's not going to do
either of us any good, but...

09:45.293 --> 09:47.379
I know what will.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.464
What?

09:51.425 --> 09:54.677
You've always dreamt
about being a star.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.637
Now's your chance.

09:56.679 --> 09:58.014
You go out there

09:58.056 --> 09:59.182
and you show everyone

09:59.224 --> 10:01.601
how incredibly talented
you really are.

10:03.437 --> 10:05.313
[♪♪♪]

10:06.606 --> 10:07.941
[Elizabeth] Oh, Abigail.

10:07.982 --> 10:09.650
I can't imagine what
you must be feeling right now.

10:09.692 --> 10:10.777
Carolyn can give them
a lot of things

10:10.818 --> 10:12.653
that I can't.

10:12.695 --> 10:14.239
Not the kind of things
you've given them!

10:14.281 --> 10:15.449
Just the same.

10:15.490 --> 10:16.699
Having family that can
provide for their needs

10:16.741 --> 10:18.993
is a real blessing.

10:20.912 --> 10:23.664
Do they know yet?

10:23.706 --> 10:26.000
No.

10:26.042 --> 10:29.379
I'll tell them
at dinner.

10:29.421 --> 10:31.089
[sighs]

10:35.718 --> 10:37.845
[door thuds]

10:39.306 --> 10:41.682
This is a surprise.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.059
There was nothing
to do at the hotel,

10:43.101 --> 10:46.187
so I thought I'd come by
and meet the children.

10:47.230 --> 10:48.523
Is it true?

10:48.565 --> 10:50.733
Are we going to live with her?

10:50.775 --> 10:51.901
[sighs]

10:51.943 --> 10:54.488
Yes, sweetheart.
It's true.

11:06.124 --> 11:08.668
[Cody, tearfully]
Why's she taking us away?

11:08.709 --> 11:10.295
Oh, no, don't
think of it that way.

11:10.337 --> 11:13.714
You and Becky are gonna
live in a big house.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.758
But I don't want to live
in a big house.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.802
I want to live here.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.429
My friends are here.

11:19.471 --> 11:20.597
You're here.

11:20.639 --> 11:21.764
Yes, but
you'll write letters,

11:21.806 --> 11:23.600
and you'll come and visit
whenever you want.

11:23.642 --> 11:25.560
Will you visit me, too?

11:25.602 --> 11:27.479
Oh, of course, I will.

11:27.521 --> 11:30.731
You won't give my room away
to anyone else?

11:30.773 --> 11:33.527
No. It'll be right here
waiting for you,

11:33.568 --> 11:35.694
exactly as you left it.

11:35.736 --> 11:39.366
Aunt Carolyn said
she'll take us places.

11:39.407 --> 11:41.034
That sounds like fun!

11:41.909 --> 11:43.744
I could bring you
back presents.

11:43.786 --> 11:45.746
And send me postcards.

11:45.788 --> 11:47.832
And send them
to my friends, too,

11:47.874 --> 11:51.294
so nobody forgets about me.

11:51.336 --> 11:54.673
Oh! How could we ever
forget about you?

11:54.713 --> 11:57.008
[chuckling]

12:00.428 --> 12:02.556
[Carolyn] I had no idea
this would cause such an upset.

12:02.597 --> 12:03.764
He'll be
all right.

12:03.806 --> 12:05.975
It's just a bit of
a shock, that's all.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.897
Let's have
breakfast tomorrow,

12:10.938 --> 12:12.815
then we can
get to know each other.

12:12.857 --> 12:14.775
Okay.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.152
And don't you worry.

12:16.194 --> 12:18.779
We'll get you out of
that wheelchair in no time.

12:18.821 --> 12:20.781
I'm thinking
a trip to Switzerland

12:20.823 --> 12:22.075
might do
some good.

12:22.116 --> 12:24.327
That sounds exciting,
doesn't it?

12:27.872 --> 12:30.124
Goodbye, dear.

12:43.638 --> 12:45.139
[Jack] Edith
wouldn't take it.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.183
Why not?

12:47.225 --> 12:48.101
It's like I told you,

12:48.142 --> 12:49.185
she doesn't
want the money.

12:49.227 --> 12:50.144
And I told you,

12:50.186 --> 12:51.812
it didn't work
between her and me.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.398
Maybe that's because
you didn't try hard enough.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.315
You weren't there.

12:54.357 --> 12:55.400
Look.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.817
I know you're young--

12:56.859 --> 12:58.319
You don't know anything!

12:58.361 --> 12:59.696
Me and Edith,

12:59.738 --> 13:00.905
we should've never got married
in the first place.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.741
I wasn't ready to settle down.

13:02.781 --> 13:04.451
You can't run away
from your problems.

13:04.492 --> 13:05.493
What was I supposed to do?

13:05.535 --> 13:06.703
Talk to her.

13:06.745 --> 13:08.955
Work it out.
Admit what you did was wrong.

13:08.996 --> 13:12.833
All my father did
was yell at my mother.

13:12.875 --> 13:15.253
It would've been better
if he left.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.837
You're not your father, Roy.

13:16.879 --> 13:19.048
You don't have to make
the same mistakes he did.

13:20.425 --> 13:21.635
It's too late now.

13:21.676 --> 13:23.177
It's never too late.

13:25.472 --> 13:26.889
I didn't mean to hurt her.

13:26.931 --> 13:29.392
Then talk to her.
Tell her how you feel.

13:29.434 --> 13:31.519
What's the point?

13:35.774 --> 13:37.900
Here's the point.

13:40.570 --> 13:43.030
His name's Oliver.

13:43.072 --> 13:46.159
And he deserves to have
a mother and a father.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.327
I don't want to see it.

13:50.913 --> 13:53.832
Being scared
doesn't make you a coward.

13:55.752 --> 13:57.796
You don't have to be
the perfect husband

13:57.836 --> 13:59.422
or the perfect father--
no one is.

13:59.464 --> 14:01.299
I just...

14:01.341 --> 14:03.884
I don't know
if I can do it.

14:03.926 --> 14:05.844
The Man Upstairs
thinks you can.

14:05.886 --> 14:07.930
Or He wouldn't have
given you the chance.

14:10.642 --> 14:12.393
[footsteps]

14:12.435 --> 14:13.436
May I have
a word with you?

14:13.478 --> 14:14.437
Please.

14:14.479 --> 14:16.523
I can't stay.

14:16.564 --> 14:17.898
I just came to tell you

14:17.940 --> 14:19.900
that I really didn't
appreciate what you did.

14:19.942 --> 14:22.028
What exactly did I do?

14:22.069 --> 14:24.489
I asked you to let me tell
the children what was happening,

14:24.531 --> 14:25.532
and you told them
instead.

14:25.573 --> 14:26.533
You had no right.

14:26.574 --> 14:28.660
I had every right.

14:28.702 --> 14:30.787
I'm the children's aunt,

14:30.829 --> 14:32.913
their closest living relative,

14:32.955 --> 14:34.749
which makes me
their legal guardian.

14:34.791 --> 14:36.292
That doesn't mean
you know what's best for them.

14:36.334 --> 14:37.669
And you do?

14:37.711 --> 14:40.630
I don't think moving with you
to Davenport

14:40.672 --> 14:41.964
is such a good idea.

14:42.006 --> 14:43.924
I don't remember
asking for your opinion.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.051
They're
settled here.

14:45.092 --> 14:45.926
This is their home.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.804
Mrs. Stanton, please.

14:47.846 --> 14:51.057
I don't want
to argue with you.

14:51.098 --> 14:52.266
It isn't civilized.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.185
I don't care if it's civilized.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.311
I care about Cody and Becky.

14:55.353 --> 14:57.355
So do I.

15:01.776 --> 15:03.944
You have till Tuesday
to pack their things.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.530
I think that gives
everyone plenty of time

15:05.572 --> 15:07.365
to say their goodbyes,
don't you?

15:07.407 --> 15:08.408
That's too soon.

15:09.784 --> 15:11.703
I'm trying to be reasonable,

15:11.745 --> 15:13.580
but if this is going
to get unpleasant,

15:13.621 --> 15:15.331
we can always leave sooner.

15:21.755 --> 15:24.924
I understand
you lost your job.

15:29.011 --> 15:30.971
Didn't like it much anyway.

15:31.013 --> 15:32.973
Well, that's unfortunate,

15:33.015 --> 15:35.226
though I do have
an opportunity for you,

15:35.268 --> 15:37.144
if you're interested.

15:48.364 --> 15:50.408
What do you need me to do?

15:52.452 --> 15:54.954
So...

15:54.995 --> 15:57.290
did you read
the pages I gave you?

15:57.331 --> 15:58.999
I did.

15:59.041 --> 16:00.585
I just...

16:00.627 --> 16:02.211
I felt like
there needed to be more.

16:02.253 --> 16:03.421
More Theodore?

16:03.463 --> 16:05.131
No. Just more...
stuff.

16:05.172 --> 16:06.299
"Stuff"?

16:06.340 --> 16:09.469
Yeah. Like...
like a shoot-out.

16:09.510 --> 16:10.845
I don't write shoot-outs.

16:10.887 --> 16:12.555
Well, it could be great!
Think about it.

16:12.597 --> 16:14.599
Theodore, he takes on
the Garrison Gang,

16:14.641 --> 16:16.016
or the Tolliver Gang.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.101
It's three against one,

16:17.143 --> 16:18.603
a damsel's in distress--

16:18.645 --> 16:19.729
Or how about this?

16:19.771 --> 16:22.064
Theodore comes down

16:22.106 --> 16:23.983
with a very bad
case of laryngitis

16:24.024 --> 16:26.986
and he can't come up
with any more great suggestions?

16:28.070 --> 16:29.155
Elizabeth...

16:29.196 --> 16:31.365
you're not mad at me
for giving you ideas?

16:32.325 --> 16:33.409
No.

16:33.451 --> 16:35.119
Of course not.
It's just...

16:35.161 --> 16:37.163
Sometimes, I doubt myself.

16:38.790 --> 16:42.585
I doubt that I'll ever be able
to write anything...

16:42.627 --> 16:44.754
good enough
to be published.

16:44.796 --> 16:47.047
Listen to me.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.008
There are not enough women

16:49.049 --> 16:52.219
who are writing about what
life is like on the frontier.

16:52.261 --> 16:54.221
You have something
very important to say.

16:55.807 --> 16:57.517
Maybe I just need
a little more encouragement.

17:03.815 --> 17:05.483
How's that?

17:08.361 --> 17:10.070
Encouraging.

17:10.112 --> 17:11.030
[chuckles]

17:13.115 --> 17:13.908
[Nora] Bill?

17:13.950 --> 17:15.326
Did you have Henry arrested

17:15.368 --> 17:17.954
because you don't like
seeing the two of us together?

17:17.996 --> 17:20.080
He was arrested
because we found evidence

17:20.122 --> 17:21.248
in his car.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.249
He said
he was being framed.

17:22.291 --> 17:23.710
[chuckles dryly]

17:23.751 --> 17:27.171
And Henry Gowen
always tells the truth.

17:28.339 --> 17:31.091
Sometimes, we only see the side
of someone we want to see.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.343
That's right.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.387
And you only see the side of him
you want to see.

17:34.428 --> 17:35.596
You've always
had a blind spot

17:35.638 --> 17:37.724
when it comes
to that man.

17:37.765 --> 17:39.475
I might say
the same about you.

17:39.517 --> 17:40.768
Did it ever occur to you

17:40.810 --> 17:41.978
that he's using you
to get back at me?

17:42.020 --> 17:44.104
Henry would never hurt me.

17:44.146 --> 17:46.106
Well, I wish I could be
as sure of that as you are.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.153
I keep hoping
it's a dream

17:51.195 --> 17:53.113
and that I
suddenly wake up.

17:53.155 --> 17:54.532
Whatever happens,

17:54.574 --> 17:56.784
you should be proud of
what you did with those kids.

17:56.826 --> 17:58.870
I feel like I'm being tested.

17:58.912 --> 18:00.663
God never gives us
more than we can handle.

18:00.705 --> 18:01.748
Of course not.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.123
And I know I'm supposed
to be strong

18:03.165 --> 18:04.959
and do the right thing...

18:05.001 --> 18:07.127
[choking up] But if
you want to know the truth,

18:07.169 --> 18:08.462
I am tired
of being tested.

18:08.504 --> 18:10.006
Abigail. Abigail...

18:11.173 --> 18:12.675
Cody and Becky

18:12.717 --> 18:14.719
aren't going away forever.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.054
You'll see them again.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.556
I don't know
why this is happening.

18:18.598 --> 18:21.768
Neither do I.

18:21.809 --> 18:24.228
But I know there's a plan.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.272
And so do you.

18:29.191 --> 18:31.277
[sobs]

18:36.490 --> 18:38.826
[Carolyn] You're going to love
your new home in Davenport.

18:38.868 --> 18:40.160
There's a stream out back

18:40.202 --> 18:42.162
where you can
catch tadpoles

18:42.204 --> 18:43.289
and skip rocks.

18:43.330 --> 18:45.165
I like playing baseball.

18:45.207 --> 18:46.709
You can do that, too.

18:46.751 --> 18:48.127
And Becky, darling,

18:48.168 --> 18:49.503
as soon
as we get settled,

18:49.545 --> 18:52.632
we can go shopping
for a whole new wardrobe.

18:52.673 --> 18:55.051
I think pink is your color.

18:55.093 --> 18:57.095
Pink's nice.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.513
Sorry to interrupt.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.265
Miss Abigail
wanted me to tell you

19:01.307 --> 19:03.601
that it's time
to get ready for school.

19:08.106 --> 19:10.650
[Elizabeth chuckles]

19:13.319 --> 19:14.779
Guess they weren't
very hungry.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.489
Or they didn't like
the company.

19:16.530 --> 19:19.742
Oh, they just
need to get to know you.

19:19.784 --> 19:21.828
And they're probably
a little scared.

19:21.869 --> 19:22.912
Of me?

19:22.954 --> 19:24.204
No. Of the future.

19:24.246 --> 19:26.206
Cody's gotten
used to things here,

19:26.248 --> 19:28.250
and Becky was just starting
to find her passion.

19:28.292 --> 19:30.044
Which is?

19:30.086 --> 19:31.796
Science and math.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.213
Oh, no.
She won't have time for that,

19:33.255 --> 19:34.882
with the social
season starting.

19:34.924 --> 19:36.509
Not if she's going to be
presented this year.

19:36.550 --> 19:38.552
Well, there's always time
for things that you love.

19:38.594 --> 19:42.056
And she is going to love
being a debutante.

19:42.098 --> 19:44.183
Now, if you'll excuse me,

19:44.224 --> 19:46.686
I have a few things
to pick up at the Mercantile.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.896
It's a pleasure seeing you
again, Miss Thatcher.

19:53.567 --> 19:55.235
You need to
come to Hollywood

19:55.277 --> 19:57.237
when the Reluctant Bride
is finished.

19:57.279 --> 19:59.657
You're just saying
that to be kind.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.702
Don't take this
the wrong way, but...

20:02.743 --> 20:05.245
you are an investment to me.

20:05.287 --> 20:06.246
An investment?

20:06.288 --> 20:07.456
Yes.

20:07.498 --> 20:10.250
One picture
is not going to make you a star,

20:10.292 --> 20:11.460
and it won't make me
any money,

20:11.502 --> 20:14.254
but if you come to Hollywood
and work hard,

20:14.296 --> 20:15.548
I guarantee you,

20:15.589 --> 20:17.133
by our third movie,

20:17.175 --> 20:19.510
you will be more famous
than Mary Medford.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.554
You can't guarantee that.

20:21.595 --> 20:25.558
Hollywood
is the city of dreams, Rosemary,

20:25.599 --> 20:28.477
and no one dreams bigger
than I do.

20:34.483 --> 20:37.570
I hear you're working
for Gowen now.

20:37.611 --> 20:38.946
He's paying me
twice as much

20:38.988 --> 20:40.948
as I was making
at the Mercantile.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.950
I know you're always
looking for the big payday.

20:42.992 --> 20:45.536
Just don't do something
you're going to regret.

20:49.331 --> 20:51.667
I can take care of myself.

20:54.336 --> 20:56.255
[♪♪♪]

20:58.632 --> 21:00.551
If people keep
making withdrawals,

21:00.593 --> 21:02.053
we may have to
close down.

21:02.095 --> 21:03.679
The last thing we need
is a run on the bank.

21:03.721 --> 21:05.305
There won't be
any trouble,

21:05.347 --> 21:06.306
I promise,

21:06.348 --> 21:07.516
but I'm here
if you need me.

21:07.558 --> 21:09.309
I appreciate it.

21:09.351 --> 21:11.854
Uh, Constable?

21:11.896 --> 21:15.816
I'm sorry, we can't give you
the loan to buy that land,

21:15.858 --> 21:18.736
at least not until
things get back to normal.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.320
Don't worry about it,
Mr. Jenkins.

21:20.362 --> 21:23.074
Most people
aren't as nice as you.

21:23.116 --> 21:24.992
We've only given one loan
in the past month,

21:25.034 --> 21:27.661
and that was because Mr. Barrett
had half the down payment.

21:27.703 --> 21:29.663
Wait a second. Mr. Barrett is
buying the house he's renting?

21:29.705 --> 21:31.207
The one next to Miss Thatcher?

21:31.249 --> 21:33.251
He is.

21:34.376 --> 21:35.628
[Jack] Now, how is it
he is so flush

21:35.669 --> 21:37.755
when everyone else is hurting?

21:37.797 --> 21:39.423
Could be he's on
two payrolls.

21:39.465 --> 21:40.549
We always thought

21:40.591 --> 21:42.676
there had to be
an inside man.

21:42.718 --> 21:44.762
Question is,
who's he working for?

21:44.804 --> 21:46.346
The tire tracks
leading up to the parcel

21:46.388 --> 21:47.556
where the trees
were spiked--

21:47.598 --> 21:48.808
you know, Jack,
we just assumed

21:48.849 --> 21:51.060
those were
from Gowen's car.

21:51.102 --> 21:52.311
Because that's

21:52.352 --> 21:54.313
what someone
wanted us to assume.

21:54.354 --> 21:56.315
[Opal] Do you
like my project?

21:56.356 --> 21:58.276
I think
it's fantastic.

21:58.317 --> 22:01.320
But you might want to check
how to spell "honey."

22:07.326 --> 22:08.327
Wow!

22:11.872 --> 22:14.541
Becky, the judge
will be here in two days.

22:14.583 --> 22:16.043
Don't you want
to finish the decking?

22:16.085 --> 22:17.377
Why bother?

22:17.419 --> 22:19.338
Becky...

22:19.379 --> 22:20.631
Aunt Carolyn
won't let me go to school

22:20.673 --> 22:22.382
even if I win the scholarship.

22:22.424 --> 22:23.968
You can't give up.

22:24.969 --> 22:27.138
And you have to show your aunt
what matters to you.

22:28.931 --> 22:31.391
You've come so far, Becky.
You can't quit now.

22:31.433 --> 22:34.312

22:46.448 --> 22:47.700
What's the latest?

22:48.784 --> 22:50.077
Won't be much longer.

22:50.119 --> 22:52.288
Coulter's just about
out of business.

22:53.247 --> 22:55.916
Spiking those trees
put him right on the edge.

22:55.958 --> 22:58.294
As soon as
I buy his operation,

22:58.336 --> 23:00.546
I'm gonna promote
you to foreman

23:00.587 --> 23:01.797
in charge
of all my mills.

23:01.839 --> 23:04.342
Hard job to do
when you're sitting in a cell.

23:22.484 --> 23:23.903
[Nora] You've been cleared
of the charges.

23:23.944 --> 23:25.779
I think we should celebrate.

23:25.821 --> 23:27.240
No, there's
nothing to celebrate.

23:27.281 --> 23:29.075
Don't you think
this feud with Bill

23:29.116 --> 23:30.243
has gone on long enough?

23:30.284 --> 23:31.535
You're not married
to him anymore, Nora.

23:31.577 --> 23:32.828
You needn't defend him.

23:32.870 --> 23:34.454
He made a mistake.
I'm sure he's sorry for it.

23:34.496 --> 23:37.583
Well, that man won't quit
until I'm ruined,

23:37.624 --> 23:39.210
and I won't
let that happen.

23:39.252 --> 23:41.128
I think you're making
too much of this.

23:41.170 --> 23:43.214
Well, I didn't ask
your opinion.

23:44.715 --> 23:47.467
You have to choose, Nora.

23:47.509 --> 23:50.096
You're either with me
or you're against me.

23:52.514 --> 23:54.432
Now that
this is over,

23:54.474 --> 23:57.019
you must have some
free time on your hands.

23:57.061 --> 23:58.187
Well, it sounds like

23:58.229 --> 24:00.522
you must have
something in mind?

24:00.564 --> 24:01.607
How would you feel

24:01.648 --> 24:04.610
if, this time,
I made you dinner?

24:04.651 --> 24:06.237
Well...

24:06.279 --> 24:08.364
I just might have to
take you up on that.

24:08.406 --> 24:10.448
Hmm! [chuckles]

24:15.537 --> 24:17.331
Why does she look so happy?

I'll let you figure that out.

24:32.138 --> 24:34.223
[Lee] You're seriously
considering going to Hollywood?

24:34.265 --> 24:35.808
James thinks
the theater is dying,

24:35.849 --> 24:37.768
and moving pictures
are the future.

24:37.810 --> 24:40.438
Well, that may be,
but are they your future?

24:40.478 --> 24:41.730
Let's be honest.

24:41.772 --> 24:43.274
I'm not getting any younger.

24:43.316 --> 24:45.067
I don't have
many chances left.

24:45.109 --> 24:46.193
If I don't
take this one,

24:46.235 --> 24:47.527
I don't know
when I'll get another one,

24:47.569 --> 24:49.696
or if I'll get another one.

24:49.738 --> 24:50.906
Well, if it's how
you truly feel,

24:50.948 --> 24:54.368
then, no,
you can't turn it down.

24:55.202 --> 24:56.787
So you think I should go?

24:56.829 --> 24:59.497
Well, I think...

25:01.417 --> 25:03.501
I think you should do
whatever makes you happy.

25:04.586 --> 25:06.546
I would come back
between pictures.

25:06.588 --> 25:07.547
It wouldn't be forever--

25:07.589 --> 25:09.133
[cuts her off] You can't...

25:09.175 --> 25:11.509
You can't promise that.

25:14.888 --> 25:17.308
You're not making this
any easier.

25:18.767 --> 25:20.518
Maybe the best
I can manage right now

25:20.560 --> 25:22.604
is just to not make it
any harder.

25:31.113 --> 25:32.239
[Lee]
I never would've guessed

25:32.281 --> 25:34.074
that it was Barrett
behind the sabotage.

25:34.116 --> 25:35.368
I can't believe
I'm gonna say this,

25:35.409 --> 25:37.953
but I think I owe
Henry Gowen an apology.

25:37.995 --> 25:40.039
Well, Lee,
you're not the only one.

25:40.080 --> 25:42.582
Can't wait to tell my men
we're back in business.

25:42.624 --> 25:43.583
Then why are you still here?

Gowen is innocent?

25:50.799 --> 25:52.801
Yeah. This time.

25:52.843 --> 25:55.262
And Wade Barrett seemed
so nice, and so helpful.

25:55.304 --> 25:58.598
Should I start to worry
about your judgment in men?

25:58.640 --> 26:01.768
I've made a good decision
or two in the past.

I was saving up my allowance
for a better one,

Anything.

It's not for me.

26:48.399 --> 26:49.649
It's for Miss Abigail.

She said
I was the man of the house,

26:52.152 --> 26:55.655

It's okay to cry, Becky.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.354
Maybe I'm being punished.

27:28.314 --> 27:30.524
Maybe that's the reason
I'm in this wheelchair.

That's not
the reason at all.

That's part
of the challenge.

27:49.251 --> 27:51.711
Sometimes,
even the strongest people

27:51.753 --> 27:53.713
are so paralyzed
by what happened,

more to offer here

Of course you do.
This is a wonderful place.

28:28.790 --> 28:31.335

Miss Thatcher,
I care for my niece very much.

28:43.222 --> 28:45.265
I don't want to see her
throw away her life,

28:45.307 --> 28:47.267
like her mother did.

28:47.309 --> 28:48.768
I don't understand.

28:48.810 --> 28:52.189
I don't intend any disrespect
to the children's father...

28:52.231 --> 28:55.317
but their mother married a man
beneath her means.

28:55.359 --> 28:56.569
I just want
something better

28:56.610 --> 28:57.903
for Becky,
that's all.

28:57.944 --> 29:00.573
But that's not
what Becky wants.

29:00.614 --> 29:02.782
She's just a child.

29:02.824 --> 29:05.202
Becky's a brilliant girl.

29:05.244 --> 29:06.786
She's years ahead
of anyone her age,

29:06.828 --> 29:08.914
with a real gift,
a real intellect.

29:08.955 --> 29:10.957
Forgive me for being blunt,

29:10.999 --> 29:13.877
but "intellect" doesn't
usually attract a husband.

29:13.919 --> 29:15.629
But Becky can accomplish
so much in life,

29:15.671 --> 29:17.047
if you'll only let her,

29:17.089 --> 29:19.091
but now she's ready
to give up.

29:19.132 --> 29:21.468
She doesn't even
want to walk again.

29:22.678 --> 29:24.012
Did she say something to you?

29:24.054 --> 29:25.805
Why don't you come
to the Science Fair?

29:25.847 --> 29:29.393
I think it would mean
everything to her.

29:31.437 --> 29:32.812

29:32.854 --> 29:35.190
Didn't I ask you
to stop doing things for me?

29:35.232 --> 29:36.149
Did you?

29:36.191 --> 29:38.694
Well, it must be
the cold weather.

29:38.736 --> 29:40.112
Sometimes, it affects
my hearing.

29:40.153 --> 29:42.822
Faith told me
why you borrowed my locket.

29:42.864 --> 29:44.866
You don't give up, do you?

29:44.908 --> 29:47.786
Not when it's something
I care about.

29:50.914 --> 29:52.832
Edith...

29:52.874 --> 29:54.918
I am truly sorry
if I got your hopes up.

29:54.960 --> 29:57.588
I know your heart
was in the right place.

29:58.880 --> 30:00.799
That mean
I can get back to work?

30:02.884 --> 30:04.844
[Roy] That's my job.

30:04.886 --> 30:06.680
Roy?

30:08.056 --> 30:09.808
I know
I did wrong...

30:10.934 --> 30:13.145
But do you think--

30:13.186 --> 30:15.147
Can you forgive me?

30:20.736 --> 30:23.322
I want us
to be a family.

30:24.823 --> 30:27.159
I can't promise
I'll be good at it.

30:28.285 --> 30:30.329
You don't
have to promise.

30:33.915 --> 30:36.293
Would you like
to meet your son?

30:36.335 --> 30:38.712
I'd like that very much.

When I grow up,
I'm going to be a bear doctor.

31:01.067 --> 31:02.902
You mean a veterinarian?

31:02.944 --> 31:04.822
No. A bear doctor.

31:04.863 --> 31:09.201
[Judge] There are some
very impressive projects here.

31:10.661 --> 31:12.329
Interesting.

31:14.832 --> 31:16.458
How are you
supporting the load?

31:16.500 --> 31:18.918
Half with suspension wires,
half with trusses.

31:18.960 --> 31:20.170
Roebling's design.

31:20.212 --> 31:22.130
Her calculations are here.

31:22.172 --> 31:23.716
And you didn't help her?

31:23.757 --> 31:24.924
No, sir.

31:24.966 --> 31:27.636
[astonished chuckle]

31:27.678 --> 31:29.513
This is college-level work.

31:29.555 --> 31:30.930

[Abigail] Oh!

31:32.932 --> 31:34.142

31:36.478 --> 31:37.646
Is her mother here?

31:37.688 --> 31:38.938
You can
talk to me.

31:38.980 --> 31:41.608
You must be
very proud.

31:41.650 --> 31:43.527
I-- am.

31:43.569 --> 31:46.279
Even if she doesn't
win the scholarship

31:46.321 --> 31:47.531
in the next round--

31:47.573 --> 31:49.491
and, frankly,
I don't see why she wouldn't--

31:49.533 --> 31:52.285
she needs to enroll
in a technical university

31:52.327 --> 31:54.621
that can help
develop her talent.

31:54.663 --> 31:55.955
I'll think about that.

31:57.708 --> 31:59.459
Will the winner join me
up front for a photo?

Of course! Becky?

For a future movie star,
you don't look very happy.

33:35.054 --> 33:37.056
I've always believed
that people

33:37.098 --> 33:39.058
should follow
their dreams,

33:39.100 --> 33:41.770
except I don't really know
what my dreams are anymore.

33:41.812 --> 33:43.396
Well, dreams can change.

33:43.438 --> 33:44.481
You think so?

33:44.523 --> 33:46.065
Sure! You came
to Hope Valley

33:46.107 --> 33:48.777
in pursuit of a romance
that was more important to you

33:48.819 --> 33:49.903
than becoming
a star.

33:49.945 --> 33:52.405
That didn't go exactly
as I had planned.

33:52.447 --> 33:55.408
Thanks to you, as I recall.

33:55.450 --> 33:56.910
But you stayed anyway.

33:57.870 --> 34:00.288
I guess this dear little town
grew on me.

34:01.206 --> 34:03.082
That's because
you found a life here,

34:03.124 --> 34:05.878
and you never once
felt incomplete.

34:05.919 --> 34:08.463
Not until someone said
you were missing something,

34:08.505 --> 34:12.050
something that you haven't
needed for a very long time.

34:14.427 --> 34:16.722
I wish it wasn't so confusing.

34:16.763 --> 34:18.849
It's not.

34:18.891 --> 34:21.601
Your heart called you here,
Rosemary.

34:21.643 --> 34:23.937
Listen to it.

34:32.362 --> 34:35.032
Cody's only taking one bag?

34:35.073 --> 34:37.492
He's leaving
everything else here.

34:37.534 --> 34:38.952
I know this is hard for you,

34:38.994 --> 34:40.829
but I really believe

34:40.871 --> 34:41.914
this is the right thing
for them.

34:41.955 --> 34:43.415
I know you do.

34:48.378 --> 34:50.547
Now...

34:51.798 --> 34:54.133
First, no mushrooms.

34:54.175 --> 34:55.844
I'm sorry?

34:55.886 --> 34:57.846
Cody loves gravy
on his mashed potatoes,

34:57.888 --> 34:59.347
but he hates
when mushrooms are in it.

34:59.389 --> 35:01.099
No mushrooms
in the gravy.

35:01.140 --> 35:03.518
And don't make his bath water
too hot.

35:03.560 --> 35:05.729
He won't get in
until it's lukewarm.

35:05.771 --> 35:08.147
And when you tuck him into bed
at night,

35:08.189 --> 35:10.400
he likes the covers
up to his neck,

35:10.442 --> 35:11.484
but not too tight.

35:11.526 --> 35:14.112
I'll remember that.

35:22.203 --> 35:24.122
Abigail?

35:25.331 --> 35:27.876
Before I take them...

35:27.918 --> 35:30.128
I'd really like your blessing.

35:31.212 --> 35:33.506
Tell me you love those children
as much as I do,

35:33.548 --> 35:35.133
and you'll have it.

35:39.178 --> 35:41.848
All right.
I want to start on the window,

35:41.890 --> 35:44.559
and then pan over to the door
for her entrance.

35:49.898 --> 35:52.067
Well, there she is--

35:52.109 --> 35:54.987

No.

You don't.

37:15.734 --> 37:17.652
I want what's best
for the children.

37:17.694 --> 37:21.280
And you were right
about what's best.

37:21.322 --> 37:23.366
Does that mean
we don't have to go?

37:24.951 --> 37:27.537
I should have seen it sooner.

37:27.579 --> 37:29.288
Cody's happy here.

This is where he belongs.

37:31.541 --> 37:34.335
What about Becky?

37:35.587 --> 37:36.796
Becky can stay

37:36.838 --> 37:39.257

competition next week.

37:39.298 --> 37:40.258
I can?

37:40.299 --> 37:41.300
Yes, you can.

37:41.342 --> 37:42.844
And even if you don't win,

37:42.886 --> 37:44.596
your uncle and I

37:44.637 --> 37:46.347

Thank you so much.

it's what you want to do?

37:55.857 --> 37:57.316
I think so.

37:57.358 --> 37:59.318
But I won't go
if you don't want me to.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.905
Will you come back

a time to start over.

38:49.577 --> 38:52.247

[Jack] I had another thought
about your story.

38:56.751 --> 38:58.377
Oh, I can't
wait to hear it.

y-you don't have an ending yet.

That's because
I keep changing it.

You need to build up

You have
anything in mind?

39:09.388 --> 39:10.348

Mm-hmm. Her hair
never gets messy.

39:26.823 --> 39:29.408
And she's quite talented
at whittling.

39:29.450 --> 39:30.702
Whittling?

39:33.454 --> 39:34.664
Pretty close to it.

But she's got to have
some kind of weakness.

On the bright side,
they let me keep the dress.

40:13.536 --> 40:15.454
Why'd they leave?

40:15.496 --> 40:18.333
When I told James
I wasn't going to Hollywood,

40:18.375 --> 40:21.211
he said it wasn't worth
investing in my talent.

40:21.253 --> 40:23.421
So you decided not
to go to Hollywood?

40:25.173 --> 40:27.466
Maybe James is right.
