14:44.600 --> 14:48.840
All good, yes.
I'm on my way.

14:49.600 --> 14:55.080
Yeah, I'm meeting him
in this hotel on Kudamm.

14:55.320 --> 14:59.480
It seems like a rich person's place,
so maybe he has money.

14:59.760 --> 15:01.600
I will send you the name of the hotel.

15:01.800 --> 15:06.600
He gave me tons of information,
he appears to be using his real name...

15:06.800 --> 15:08.600
So, you know...

15:58.880 --> 16:00.520
Take me hard.

16:01.840 --> 16:04.880
Take me hard.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.920
Yes, I want you to take me.

16:12.320 --> 16:14.360
I want you to take me.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.600
Take me really hard.

16:37.920 --> 16:39.560
Put it in.

16:57.560 --> 16:58.680
Yes, very good.

24:24.760 --> 24:26.760
Up or down?

24:29.640 --> 24:35.200
No, this way it looks
like I have a penis pointing down.

24:42.760 --> 24:46.240
Mom, I can tell from here
you're not straight.

24:46.480 --> 24:48.200
Should it align there?

24:48.400 --> 24:53.120
- Here!
- Ah, it should align there.

24:53.360 --> 24:55.200
Just try, take a test shot.

24:58.480 --> 24:59.600
Focus.

25:00.720 --> 25:02.440
- Wanna see?
- Focus.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.440
One of them should be fine.

25:10.040 --> 25:11.720
Hopefully.

25:17.120 --> 25:20.720
Where is the focus?

25:22.320 --> 25:24.920
Where is the focus?

25:27.480 --> 25:28.800
No good?

25:35.760 --> 25:39.200
I didn't move, so...

25:47.200 --> 25:49.360
- Show me.
- I didn't move this time.

25:49.560 --> 25:50.800
Good girl.

25:56.520 --> 26:00.120
Mom, how could you possibly
not have moved, when it looks like this?

26:00.360 --> 26:01.760
How is that possible?

26:01.960 --> 26:03.960
I did not move.

26:06.640 --> 26:08.240
Jesus Christ.

26:08.480 --> 26:11.760
Don't get angry!
I'll try again my way.

26:11.960 --> 26:14.520
No, it's okay, we're almost there.

27:01.840 --> 27:05.400
You guys have your own way
of organizing the fridge.

27:05.880 --> 27:09.520
Put this away too.
Oh, but you wouldn't know where...

27:11.040 --> 27:13.280
Who told you to buy coffee?

27:14.760 --> 27:18.120
It's always empty and it was cheap,
so I grabbed some.

27:19.080 --> 27:23.320
But you didn't buy what I needed.

27:23.520 --> 27:26.880
They didn't have hairspray and dog sheets.

27:27.440 --> 27:29.520
Then go again!

27:38.880 --> 27:40.560
This goes in the fridge?

27:40.920 --> 27:44.400
I told you to buy orechiette,
but you didn't.

27:44.600 --> 27:47.240
Yes, I did.
I put them in the fridge already.

27:47.920 --> 27:51.800
We bought them, they are there!
Inside, there!

27:52.000 --> 27:54.280
No, next to it.

27:56.040 --> 27:57.440
Here.

27:58.360 --> 28:00.000
I will put them here.

28:00.560 --> 28:02.600
But they should be in the fridge.

28:12.280 --> 28:15.480
Good morning and welcome.
We are live from the studio.

28:15.640 --> 28:20.640
Let's start with an emergency:
we need your help to find Sara.

28:21.040 --> 28:24.120
Sara is a 27 year old woman
living in Rovereto

28:24.360 --> 28:27.080
with her mother Maria
and her beloved dog Zelda.

28:27.320 --> 28:32.680
Her details: Sara is 27,
1,70m tall and has brown hair.

28:32.880 --> 28:38.440
So Maria, you were telling me you would
like to send a message to your daughter?

28:39.640 --> 28:43.360
Yes, I wanted to tell you to come home.

28:43.560 --> 28:46.080
Zelda and I miss you very much.

28:46.320 --> 28:48.040
The dog is crying.

28:48.280 --> 28:53.920
Come back home, Sara. I beg you,
wherever you are, please call me.

28:54.120 --> 28:57.720
I don't care where you are,
just please come back home.

28:57.920 --> 29:00.880
Please, come back home.

29:55.680 --> 29:58.120
Watch out, there is the sidewalk!

30:04.000 --> 30:06.320
Stop, please stop!

30:06.520 --> 30:09.120
Stop Francesca! Help!

30:11.280 --> 30:13.280
What a carousel!

30:20.280 --> 30:25.400
There is a balcony in front of my room,

30:25.600 --> 30:28.760
and one in front of the kitchen too.

30:31.520 --> 30:34.080
Do you want to sleep on the couch,
or in bed with me?

30:34.320 --> 30:36.880
We can also look for a bigger apartment.

30:37.600 --> 30:38.960
Right?

30:39.200 --> 30:42.800
I want to live alone.
You can have your own room.

30:43.400 --> 30:45.320
I'm so happy alone.

30:45.520 --> 30:47.080
Of course.

30:47.440 --> 30:51.240
Maybe I can just live nearby.
Everybody for themselves.

30:52.480 --> 30:56.360
But at least we can meet easily
without having to travel.

30:56.560 --> 31:01.800
It would be nice in the same house, the
guy next door is thinking about renting.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.600
I need two rooms, that's all.

31:04.840 --> 31:06.840
A kitchen, two rooms.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.720
You need all the reference papers.

31:12.920 --> 31:15.080
To be able to rent it, right?

31:16.680 --> 31:19.040
Otherwise, I'd need a job there.

31:19.480 --> 31:21.960
That's not strictly necessary.

31:22.360 --> 31:29.280
If you have some money and just
the fact that you are not another kid.

31:29.480 --> 31:34.680
I guess a landlord would rather
give it to a mother than to some kids.

31:35.080 --> 31:38.920
I would be a batshit crazy mother, though.

31:39.920 --> 31:42.000
It's also full of super-hot dads.

31:42.240 --> 31:44.280
- Super?
- Super hot!

31:44.480 --> 31:47.840
Young dads, because they get
some state child support.

31:48.040 --> 31:50.560
So nice.
Such a young city.

31:50.720 --> 31:53.240
Many young dads.
Super hot.

31:53.880 --> 31:55.560
You go to the park...

31:56.680 --> 31:58.360
and you drool.

32:00.040 --> 32:02.960
That's good, better to have kids
while you are young.

33:39.640 --> 33:43.680
What would I have done,
if I didn't have kids?

33:45.960 --> 33:47.440
What then?

33:49.040 --> 33:51.680
I would have worked, studied.

33:52.600 --> 33:56.920
I would have done other stuff for sure.

33:57.600 --> 34:02.480
Most probably, I would have left Italy.

34:03.600 --> 34:07.520
I would not have been here,
tied to my parents.

34:11.040 --> 34:13.360
I would have left a long time ago.

34:14.760 --> 34:17.960
And maybe, I would have never come back.

34:18.239 --> 34:20.480
Or I would just have come back for...

34:20.639 --> 34:22.440
Like I do.

34:22.600 --> 34:25.080
Yes, of course, like you do.

43:32.680 --> 43:34.600
Tickets, please.

45:57.400 --> 46:02.440
Wait, I had the whole condom
attached here.

46:02.880 --> 46:03.920
Really?

46:04.120 --> 46:06.200
Yeah...

46:07.200 --> 46:10.560
The liquid got the diary wet.

46:12.320 --> 46:17.600
Not the used condom, only its wrap,
but the oil came out.

46:17.880 --> 46:20.120
No, it wasn't this one...

46:21.280 --> 46:26.920
There were several times.
The actual first time was in a field.

46:27.360 --> 46:31.600
But it didn't really work out,
it didn't fit.

46:31.800 --> 46:36.320
Anyway, it counts
because the intention was there.

46:36.600 --> 46:41.720
At the time we thought
that you just lay on the top of the other

46:41.920 --> 46:43.800
and try to stick it in.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.760
"Why won't it fit?"
Oh, well!

48:05.840 --> 48:08.320
Try to be more harmonious.

48:09.480 --> 48:13.080
Use your whole hand, be gentle.

48:15.040 --> 48:18.000
If you give a massage to somebody,
you'll kill them.

48:18.240 --> 48:21.760
- I got better at giving massages.
- I can imagine.

48:30.640 --> 48:33.000
Carlo, what are you thinking about?

48:34.720 --> 48:37.080
- Why are you laughing?
- About the name of a band.

48:37.320 --> 48:38.680
What?

48:40.320 --> 48:42.960
- What are you thinking about?
- The name of a band.

48:43.200 --> 48:44.200
The name of what?

48:51.640 --> 48:53.800
Ina, why do they call you Eva CollÃ©?

48:54.000 --> 48:56.840
I picked it cause I didn't like
the one I had.

48:57.040 --> 49:02.840
I don't like the fact that someone else
picks the name you keep your whole life.

49:03.040 --> 49:06.640
How would you like to be called?
Do you like "Carlo"?

49:10.360 --> 49:14.680
Dad, today I was with Mayo
looking at the diaries.

49:15.200 --> 49:20.960
I found one,
where I was telling her at 14

49:21.840 --> 49:27.040
about how I loved scientific socialism

49:27.280 --> 49:30.400
and how my brother
is called Carlo after Karl Marx.

49:31.520 --> 49:32.880
That's true.

49:34.800 --> 49:35.880
I like "Carlo".

49:36.080 --> 49:38.560
I even wanted to put a K at the beginning.

49:38.720 --> 49:41.680
- But that was too much.
- It was too much.

49:43.040 --> 49:46.200
Instead you didn't want
to be called Francesca?

49:46.640 --> 49:49.200
No, I don't like it.

49:49.720 --> 49:54.840
I don't like being named after my father,
with all the names there are...

49:55.240 --> 49:57.800
I agree.
I never understood that.

52:41.800 --> 52:43.560
He won't stop anymore.

52:49.280 --> 52:51.760
Dad, can you please give me a cigarette?

53:54.200 --> 53:57.560
Hold it here.
Pull that...

54:59.440 --> 55:03.040
We finished moving there on Friday.

55:03.560 --> 55:05.560
But it's not done yet.

55:08.360 --> 55:11.800
- But are you sending your CV to Milan?
- Yes, everywhere.

55:12.000 --> 55:16.200
Milan, London,
Paris, Rome, everywhere.

01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:58.560
There are only four people
who have seen my boobs.

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:01.840
Eva, Lyne, my mother

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:05.240
and this guy I met at a concert.

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:08.040
I was so wasted
I don't even remember.

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:10.200
I was on K that night.

01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:50.640
You are hot.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.920
You are really hot.

01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:06.720
It's fair that you think so,
it's like it should be.

01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:08.480
What?

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.840
That you have only eyes for me.

01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:14.200
- Only think of me, only look at me.
- Sure.

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:16.120
Is that mutual?

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:18.240
- No, only you.
- Really?

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:19.720
Yes.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.200
Of course.

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:31.280
- What are you laughing at?
- You're such a puppy.

01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:41.320
Can I do that?

01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:49.200
Rub my head.

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:54.760
More, please.
Don't rub it so weakly.

01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:00.040
No, commit to it.

01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:02.360
No, gentle!

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:06.920
More in the front.

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:14.600
What a big beautiful leg.

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:30.200
What are you thinking about?

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:32.520
How hot you are.
