00:10.140 --> 00:11.054
Ms. Rentzel?

00:11.098 --> 00:12.403
You recently met
a young woman

00:12.447 --> 00:13.622
by the name of Zola Macer.

00:13.665 --> 00:15.841
A hacker, goes by Tidal?

00:15.885 --> 00:17.582
You should be more careful
who you associate with.

00:17.626 --> 00:18.670
CHUNK:
A new A.U.S.A.

00:18.714 --> 00:20.194

assigned to Bull's case.

Well,

00:24.850 --> 00:26.200
if I'm gonna be wrongly
imprisoned for ten years,

00:26.243 --> 00:28.028
at least it's by the best.The max is 15 years,

00:28.071 --> 00:29.420
and that's only
a sentencing guideline.

00:29.464 --> 00:30.552
I'd argue for more.

00:30.595 --> 00:31.683
You want to win this case,

00:31.727 --> 00:33.511
or do you want
to help

00:33.555 --> 00:35.035
get to the truth?

Danilo Kovalev.

He's on the move.

01:37.662 --> 01:38.794
I'm gonna keep eyes on him.

What do you want with 30 pizzas?

04:49.680 --> 04:52.988
Well, I have 12 hungry jurors
about to deliberate.

04:53.031 --> 04:54.468
So I'm gonna place
those 30 pizzas

04:54.511 --> 04:56.208
right outside
the jury room door.

04:56.252 --> 04:58.341
Not inside,
'cause that would be bribery.Oh...

04:58.385 --> 05:02.345
And I am going to, uh,
let the aroma waft into the room

05:02.389 --> 05:04.521
and they will come
to their decision more quickly.

05:04.565 --> 05:06.044
And the quicker the decision,

05:06.088 --> 05:08.177
the more likely
they are to acquit.

05:08.220 --> 05:09.352
Bingo.

05:09.396 --> 05:10.832
That doesn't break
any technical rules,

05:10.875 --> 05:12.355
but it is certainly unorthodox.

05:12.399 --> 05:13.835
Most good ideas are.

05:13.878 --> 05:16.664
Listen, I called TAC,
they told me I'd find you here.

05:16.707 --> 05:19.754
What crime am I being
falsely accused of now?

05:19.797 --> 05:22.322
No crime.
At least that I know of.

05:22.365 --> 05:25.368
Hmm.I need your help.

05:25.412 --> 05:27.239
My help?

05:27.283 --> 05:28.719
Hmm.

05:28.763 --> 05:33.681
I'm prosecuting Danilo Kovalev
on a RICO murder charge.

05:33.724 --> 05:35.073
Yeah, I heard about that.

05:35.117 --> 05:37.206
Didn't a DEA agent see him
pull the trigger?

05:37.249 --> 05:39.339
Sounds like a slam dunk.Yeah, not anymore.

05:39.382 --> 05:40.992
Tomorrow the DOJ's going public

05:41.036 --> 05:43.386
with the fact that
the DEA agent, Darren Scott,

05:43.430 --> 05:45.214
was caught stealing cash
from evidence.

05:45.257 --> 05:47.782
Now, he's refusing
to testify against Kovalev

05:47.825 --> 05:49.349
unless he gets immunity.

05:49.392 --> 05:51.046
Give him immunity,
if that's what it takes

05:51.089 --> 05:52.395
to lock up a drug lord.

05:52.439 --> 05:55.442
Scott stole from
the Kovalev arrest, too.

05:55.485 --> 06:00.229
Ah, and Kovalev's attorney
will use that to discredit him.

06:00.272 --> 06:02.100
Bingo.

06:02.144 --> 06:03.711
Well, it might hurt a bit,
but I still say

06:03.754 --> 06:06.061
the move here
is to put Scott on the stand.

06:06.104 --> 06:08.237
If I let Scott off the
hook, it sends the message

06:08.280 --> 06:09.804
that it's okay for
agents to be dirty,

06:09.847 --> 06:12.589
and dirty agents
compromise investigations.

06:12.633 --> 06:14.504
Which compromises prosecution.

06:14.548 --> 06:15.766
It's a domino effect.

06:15.810 --> 06:17.420
The entire
justice system suffers.

06:17.464 --> 06:19.379
So this slam dunk
is really more of a Hail Mary?

06:19.422 --> 06:21.381
[blows raspberry]
Without Scott,

06:21.424 --> 06:23.078
I only have
circumstantial evidence.

06:23.121 --> 06:25.515
It'll be like prosecuting
with one arm behind my back.

06:25.559 --> 06:27.561
Yeah.That's why...

06:27.604 --> 06:29.301
I want to hire you.

06:30.128 --> 06:31.303
No, you don't.

06:31.347 --> 06:32.087
I do.

06:32.130 --> 06:33.915
Really, you don't.

06:33.958 --> 06:36.004
Is this about our history?

06:36.047 --> 06:37.266
No, I have only
the fondest memory

06:37.309 --> 06:39.050
of you trying
to put me in prison.

06:39.094 --> 06:40.748
I know you were
just doing your job

06:40.791 --> 06:42.140
and I get that, but...

06:42.184 --> 06:44.142
All right, so what is it?

06:44.186 --> 06:45.579
[sighs]

06:45.622 --> 06:47.407
I don't think
you'd like my process.

06:47.450 --> 06:48.843
You think outside the box.

06:48.886 --> 06:50.584
There's nothing wrong with that.

06:50.627 --> 06:52.063
How should I put this?

06:52.107 --> 06:56.938
I'm pepperoni pizza,
and you're steamed broccoli.

06:56.981 --> 06:58.069
So what?

06:58.113 --> 07:00.071
Combined just right,

07:00.115 --> 07:01.856
those two can taste
awfully good together.

07:01.899 --> 07:03.640
Can they?

07:03.684 --> 07:07.035
Look, Kovalev's on trial
for murdering one man.

07:07.078 --> 07:10.212
We suspect that that he is
responsible for a dozen others.

07:10.255 --> 07:12.432
None of those victims'
families got justice.

07:12.475 --> 07:16.261
This is the DOJ's one chance
to put Kovalev away for good.

07:16.305 --> 07:19.569
I need the best,
and-and-and you are the best.

07:21.179 --> 07:22.920
You should have led with that.

07:22.964 --> 07:25.009
You'll do it?Well...

07:25.053 --> 07:26.881
I mean...

07:26.924 --> 07:28.099
What the hell?

07:28.143 --> 07:29.623
But when you find yourself
hating me

07:29.666 --> 07:31.755
and every move I make,
remember that I warned you.

07:31.799 --> 07:33.148
Noted. Thank you.

07:33.191 --> 07:35.498
Ooh. My acquittal is here.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.500
You want a slice?Mm, mm-mm.

07:37.544 --> 07:38.458
[laughs]:
Okay.

07:38.501 --> 07:40.547
Hey, guys. Thanks for coming.

07:40.590 --> 07:42.766
You finally made it.
We're going into the courthouse.

07:42.810 --> 07:45.769
Outside the jury deliberation
room, not inside.

07:45.813 --> 07:47.641
Come on. Double-time.

07:47.684 --> 07:48.729
I'll do this one.

07:49.730 --> 07:50.992
Okay.

07:51.732 --> 07:53.995
â™ª

08:00.697 --> 08:01.785
So, we're teaming up
with the man

08:01.829 --> 08:03.874
who tried to put Bull in prison?Awkward.

08:03.918 --> 08:05.920
If Bull can get past that,
so can we.

08:05.963 --> 08:07.661
He did have his
back in the end.

08:07.704 --> 08:11.186
Okay, United States
v. Danilo Kovalev.

08:11.229 --> 08:13.014
Surprisingly, the first time
his name's been on the docket.

08:13.057 --> 08:14.145
Really?

08:14.189 --> 08:16.104
Guy's notorious.

08:16.147 --> 08:18.149
Notoriously hard to prosecute.

08:18.193 --> 08:19.760
I heard you guys aren't using
Agent Scott's testimony.

08:19.803 --> 08:21.588
What about the partner?BULL:
Agent Cooke

08:21.631 --> 08:24.416
was in the van, so she was
not a witness to the shooting.

08:24.460 --> 08:26.244
REILLY:
And she didn't see Kovalev

08:26.288 --> 08:29.247
enter or exit the basement
where the murder took place.

08:29.291 --> 08:30.466
MARISSA: Surely someone
from the coffee shop

08:30.510 --> 08:32.381
could place Kovalev
in the basement.

08:32.424 --> 08:34.644
Probably,
but Kovalev's reputation

08:34.688 --> 08:37.908
as a dangerous crime boss
is keeping people quiet.

08:37.952 --> 08:39.170
All except one.

08:39.214 --> 08:41.216
Francesca Gant.

08:41.259 --> 08:42.783
A customer. We're
prepping her today.

08:42.826 --> 08:44.480
CHUNK:
Yeah, I'm sorry,

08:44.524 --> 08:47.135
but one witness placing Kovalev
near but not at the crime scene?

08:47.178 --> 08:48.615
If I'm defense counsel,

08:48.658 --> 08:50.791
I'm ripping that apart.Admittedly,

08:50.834 --> 08:52.488
the evidence is thin,
but Kovalev

08:52.532 --> 08:55.012
had someone with him
that day, an associate.

08:55.056 --> 08:57.232
We find him and
we flip him.

08:57.275 --> 08:59.626
Uh, we only have
a first name. Olek.

08:59.669 --> 09:00.931
But the, uh,

09:00.975 --> 09:02.933
DEA suspects
he fled to Warsaw.

09:02.977 --> 09:04.979
We have agents
on the ground there now.

09:05.022 --> 09:06.458
BULL:
Taylor,

09:06.502 --> 09:08.112
you are gonna coordinate
with the DEA search.

09:08.156 --> 09:11.768
On it.
REILLY: Actually,
you're off it.

09:11.812 --> 09:13.117
Excuse me?

09:13.161 --> 09:15.163
Ms. Rentzel didn't
pass DOJ clearance.

09:15.206 --> 09:16.338
BULL: What are you
talking about?

09:16.381 --> 09:17.600
She's one of the most
skilled analysts

09:17.644 --> 09:19.036
in her field.I understand that,

09:19.080 --> 09:20.168
but her association

09:20.211 --> 09:21.604
with a hacker named Tidal

09:21.648 --> 09:23.867
earlier this year
caused some internal concerns.

09:23.911 --> 09:25.173
BULL: What are you
talking about?

09:25.216 --> 09:26.783
She was cleared
of any wrongdoing.

09:26.827 --> 09:28.568
It doesn't matter. Even the
suggestion of Ms. Rentzel's

09:28.611 --> 09:31.266
criminal association could
taint the investigation.

09:31.309 --> 09:33.398
So not only are our hands
tied behind our back,

09:33.442 --> 09:34.922
but you're cutting
our head off, too?

09:34.965 --> 09:36.010
I'm not cutting off anything.

09:36.053 --> 09:37.489
We have a very capable DEA team

09:37.533 --> 09:39.622
already searching.It's not my team.

09:39.666 --> 09:40.710
TAYLOR:
It's okay, Bull.

09:40.754 --> 09:41.885
I'm sure the DEA
can handle this.

09:41.929 --> 09:43.278
No, this is ridiculous.

09:43.321 --> 09:45.715
TAYLOR: Really.
I'm good.

09:45.759 --> 09:48.239
Just drop it, please?

09:50.067 --> 09:51.199
BULL:
Okay.

09:51.242 --> 09:54.245
Danny, you will be the liaison

09:54.289 --> 09:55.246
with the DEA search,

09:55.290 --> 09:58.815
and that is nonnegotiable.

09:58.859 --> 10:00.948
Not a problem.

10:00.991 --> 10:02.863
You see? We found a compromise.

10:02.906 --> 10:05.909
Broccoli and pizza.

10:05.953 --> 10:07.563
[scoffs]

10:07.607 --> 10:08.738
FRANCESCA: I was at the back
of the coffee shop

10:08.782 --> 10:10.348
near the staircase when this guy

10:10.392 --> 10:12.873
came out of nowhere
and bumped into me.

10:12.916 --> 10:15.571
And this was the defendant,
Danilo Kovalev?

10:15.615 --> 10:16.790
Yes.

10:16.833 --> 10:18.226
I remember because
when he bumped into me,

10:18.269 --> 10:20.097
my coffee went everywhere.

10:20.141 --> 10:21.403
Okay, hold on,
let's pause for a second.

10:21.446 --> 10:23.318
You said
he "bumped" into you,

10:23.361 --> 10:25.712
but maybe it was more of a push?

10:25.755 --> 10:28.497
I wouldn't really
describe it as a push.

10:28.540 --> 10:29.933
Ah, how would you describe it?

10:29.977 --> 10:31.587
As a bump.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.328
Mm. Bump.

10:33.371 --> 10:35.896
Just looking for another word.

10:35.939 --> 10:37.724
Maybe "shove"?

10:37.767 --> 10:39.595
Sorry, it was just a bump.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.814
Okay, just...

10:40.857 --> 10:42.946
work with me here,
help me find a synonym.

10:42.990 --> 10:44.818
Maybe he collided with you?

10:44.861 --> 10:45.819
REILLY:Bull?

10:45.862 --> 10:47.081
Can I speak with you?

10:47.124 --> 10:48.691
Sure.

10:52.477 --> 10:54.262
Don't put words
into my witness's mouth.

10:54.305 --> 10:57.134
Oh, I thought she
was our witness.

10:57.178 --> 10:58.570
A pizza gag is one thing,

10:58.614 --> 11:00.355
but lying is a boundary
I will not cross.

11:00.398 --> 11:01.922
Okay, I don't
want her to lie,

11:01.965 --> 11:06.578
but right now, her testimony,
it's limited.

11:09.146 --> 11:11.583
Look, she didn't see
Kovalev pull the trigger.

11:11.627 --> 11:13.673
She didn't even see a gun.

11:15.457 --> 11:17.677
I need to tell a story.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.243
Yeah, but you're trying
to change her story

11:19.287 --> 11:21.593
before she's finished
telling it.
No.

11:21.637 --> 11:22.986
"Bumped" is a friendly word.

11:23.030 --> 11:25.772
We need to paint Kovalev
as a stone-cold killer.

11:25.815 --> 11:28.862
Killers don't bump.
She needs oomph.

11:28.905 --> 11:31.255
I want facts, not oomph.Okay.

11:31.299 --> 11:32.822
So you want
to put Kovalev in prison,

11:32.866 --> 11:34.258
you've hired me
to help you do that,

11:34.302 --> 11:37.044
and I'm telling you
that this word "bump"

11:37.087 --> 11:39.046
is not gonna convince 12 jurors

11:39.089 --> 11:41.570
to put someone away
for the rest of their life.

11:41.613 --> 11:45.661
I mean, if you want
to give it a try, go for it.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.664
Okay.

11:49.534 --> 11:51.798
Uh, let's, uh, try this again.

11:51.841 --> 11:53.277
This time with

11:53.321 --> 11:56.716
a little more... oomph.

12:00.676 --> 12:03.461
So, I checked in with the DEA
team that's hunting Olek.

12:03.505 --> 12:05.463
They've been searching
the same Warsaw spots for weeks

12:05.507 --> 12:06.856
and coming up empty.

12:06.900 --> 12:09.641
It's like a depressing game
of Where's Waldo?

12:09.685 --> 12:10.991
We need you.

12:11.034 --> 12:13.384
Love to be able to
help, but I'm benched.

12:13.428 --> 12:14.777
You're just gonna accept that?

12:14.821 --> 12:16.213
I don't want to taint
the investigation.

12:16.257 --> 12:19.434
[sighs] Come on,
you're not gonna taint anything.

12:19.477 --> 12:21.958
I put a lot in jeopardy
when I worked with Tidal.

12:22.002 --> 12:24.004
I don't want
to jeopardize this case, too.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.093
Did you know this Olek guy

12:26.136 --> 12:28.269
is suspected of killing
multiple people?

12:28.312 --> 12:32.186
I thought Kovalev was
the shooter.This time.

12:32.229 --> 12:35.015
But rumor is, Olek's got
a pretty big body count himself.

12:35.058 --> 12:36.581
He needs to be
taken off the streets.

12:36.625 --> 12:38.409
So now you're guilt-tripping me.

12:38.453 --> 12:40.411
Yes.The answer's still no.

12:40.455 --> 12:41.891
[sighs]

12:41.935 --> 12:44.502
Can you just reach out
to your contacts at Homeland?

12:44.546 --> 12:45.982
See if they can
point the DEA

12:46.026 --> 12:47.462
in the right direction overseas?

12:47.505 --> 12:49.725
I'm sure the DEA's
checked in with Homeland.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.814
Government agencies rarely know
what the other hand is doing.

12:51.858 --> 12:53.642
They're too proud
and territorial.

12:53.685 --> 12:55.165
True.

12:55.209 --> 12:57.515
Look, I'll keep your involvement
off the books.

12:57.559 --> 12:58.821
Just a call to Homeland.

12:58.865 --> 13:00.910
That's all I'm asking.[scoffs]

13:02.129 --> 13:06.176
Furthermore, the evidence
will show that Danilo Kovalev

13:06.220 --> 13:08.831
was in the coffee shop's
basement that morning.

13:10.224 --> 13:13.880
My question to you, the jury,
is simple: why else

13:13.923 --> 13:16.099
was Kovalev in that basement,

13:16.143 --> 13:18.710
other than to murder
Konstantin Ba...

13:18.754 --> 13:20.800
[phone ringing]

13:20.843 --> 13:22.889
NOLAN:
Whosever phone that is,
turn it off,

13:22.932 --> 13:25.326
before I have court security
confiscate it.

13:25.369 --> 13:27.023
Your Honor, excuse me.

13:27.067 --> 13:29.939
It is my mother's
medication reminder.

13:29.983 --> 13:31.680
May I quickly help her?

13:31.723 --> 13:34.596
Very well, but please hurry.

13:34.639 --> 13:36.119
Yes.

13:37.599 --> 13:39.383
Mamochka.

13:39.427 --> 13:41.821
It's okay. I got it.

13:47.087 --> 13:49.219
Forget "not guilty,"
this guy wants an Oscar.

13:49.263 --> 13:50.873
I don't know
what Kovalev's doing,

13:50.917 --> 13:52.832
but I just lost two jurors.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.572
I apologize
for the interruption.

13:54.616 --> 13:56.226
Mr. Reilly, please continue.

13:56.270 --> 13:57.837
I was essentially done,
Your Honor.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.926
Since Ms. Lamont's
reserving her opening,

13:59.969 --> 14:02.015
are you ready to proceed
with your first witness?

14:02.058 --> 14:03.930
Yes, the government
would like to...

14:03.973 --> 14:05.279
One moment, Your Honor.

14:05.322 --> 14:07.107
What is it?
[whispers]:
Ask for a recess.

14:07.150 --> 14:08.978
No, we need to keep
momentum with the jury.

14:09.022 --> 14:11.372
Ask for a recess
or I will throw this pencil

14:11.415 --> 14:13.156
at the judge and we will
get one the hard way.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.854
Very funny.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.381
The government requests
a brief recess.

14:21.251 --> 14:23.297
Kovalev put on quite
a show in there.

14:23.340 --> 14:25.168
I know. The good son act.
Hey, don't worry.

14:25.212 --> 14:26.648
I'm sure the jury
saw through it.

14:26.691 --> 14:28.215
I don't think so.

14:28.258 --> 14:29.999
You were busy watching Kovalev,
I was watching the jury.

14:30.043 --> 14:32.088
They wanted to hug
that cuddly bastard.

14:32.132 --> 14:33.133
Oh, come on.

14:33.176 --> 14:34.917
Kovalev is obviously
a sociopath.

14:34.961 --> 14:37.615
You can't get more dead
behind the eyes than that man.

14:37.659 --> 14:39.269
You see him that way because
you know about his crimes.

14:39.313 --> 14:42.272
You are primed
to see a sociopath.

14:42.316 --> 14:44.057
The jury comes in a blank slate.

14:44.100 --> 14:45.232
And now?

14:45.275 --> 14:46.842
And now, that slate reads
"angelic son."

14:46.886 --> 14:48.191
We need to convince them

14:48.235 --> 14:50.063
that he is
a dangerous criminal, Reilly.

14:50.106 --> 14:52.674
I just told them that
in my opening statement.

14:52.717 --> 14:54.937
We need to show them,
not tell them.

14:56.547 --> 14:58.941
If Kovalev is playing theater...

15:00.725 --> 15:03.337
...I think it's time
we went full opera.

15:04.251 --> 15:05.687
â™ª

15:07.602 --> 15:08.995
LAMONT:
Objection.

15:09.038 --> 15:10.953
These theatrics are
outrageously prejudicial.

15:10.997 --> 15:13.608
Your Honor, the safety of our
witness is of paramount...

15:13.651 --> 15:14.957
All parties to the bench, now.

15:20.223 --> 15:22.704
This bodyguard stunt
is clearly intended

15:22.747 --> 15:24.314
to make my client
look dangerous

15:24.358 --> 15:25.663
in front of the jury.He isdangerous.

15:25.707 --> 15:27.535
Dr. Bull, please.

15:27.578 --> 15:28.797
Using these marshals

15:28.840 --> 15:30.668
to paint the defendant
as violent

15:30.712 --> 15:33.497
is not only prejudicial,
it's disappointing.

15:33.541 --> 15:34.934
I expect better
from the government.

15:34.977 --> 15:36.370
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

15:36.413 --> 15:37.893
Marshals, you may be excused.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.329
Your presence here
is unnecessary.

15:39.373 --> 15:41.331
Now, let's get

15:41.375 --> 15:43.943
to the witness,
and no more antics.

15:43.986 --> 15:46.293
Got it?Of course, Your Honor.

15:47.163 --> 15:49.209
I feel icky.
That was a cheap stunt.

15:49.252 --> 15:52.125
It was worth it. They're
scared of him now.

15:56.433 --> 15:57.565
REILLY:
Ms. Gant,

15:57.608 --> 15:58.958
where were you
around, uh, 10:00 a.m.

15:59.001 --> 16:00.655
on Wednesday,
February 9?

16:00.698 --> 16:04.050
I was at the Romanian Garden
coffee shop near Ocean Parkway.

16:04.093 --> 16:05.573
I like to study there sometimes.

16:05.616 --> 16:09.055
And did anything unusual
happen that morning

16:09.098 --> 16:10.186
of February 9?

16:10.230 --> 16:11.709
Not that I recall.

16:12.884 --> 16:15.365
You don't recall anything
out of the ordinary?

16:15.409 --> 16:16.714
No.

16:16.758 --> 16:18.934
Do you remember
spilling your coffee?

16:18.978 --> 16:20.370
Yes.

16:20.414 --> 16:23.634
Excellent. And do you recall
who spilled your coffee?

16:23.678 --> 16:25.027
No.

16:25.071 --> 16:25.985
Uh-oh.

16:26.028 --> 16:26.811
MARISSA:
Did someone catch a case

16:26.855 --> 16:28.422
of witness amnesia?

16:28.465 --> 16:30.902
[sighs] Looks like it.REILLY:
You don't remember

16:30.946 --> 16:32.730
who collided with you

16:32.774 --> 16:35.037
and spilled coffee
all over your shirt?

16:35.081 --> 16:36.996
No.

16:38.432 --> 16:40.216
[sighs]
Your Honor,

16:40.260 --> 16:42.436
I'd like permission to treat
Ms. Gant as a hostile witness.

16:42.479 --> 16:44.046
NOLAN:
Granted. You may proceed
with leading questions.

16:44.090 --> 16:46.396
REILLY:
Ms. Gant, isn't it true
that the person

16:46.440 --> 16:48.746
who spilled your coffee
was the defendant,

16:48.790 --> 16:49.921
Danilo Kovalev?

16:49.965 --> 16:51.793
I can't recall.And isn't it true

16:51.836 --> 16:53.490
that at the time Kovalev
spilled your coffee,

16:53.534 --> 16:56.363
he was coming from the staircase
that leads to the basement?

16:56.406 --> 16:58.278
I can't recall.Ms. Gant,

16:58.321 --> 17:00.410
may I remind you
that the penalties of perjury

17:00.454 --> 17:02.064
include serious prison time?

17:02.108 --> 17:03.892
Now, I'll ask you
once more,

17:03.935 --> 17:07.069
didn't you see the defendant
come from the basement?

17:07.113 --> 17:08.288
The same basement

17:08.331 --> 17:09.941
where Konstantin Babiack
was found murdered?

17:09.985 --> 17:11.943
Objection.I'm allowed to ask
leading questions.

17:11.987 --> 17:13.945
But you're not allowed
to testify for her.

17:13.989 --> 17:14.946
I'm doing no such thing.Your Honor.

17:14.990 --> 17:16.209
NOLAN:
Overruled.

17:17.775 --> 17:19.081
Ms. Gant, please
answer the question.

17:19.125 --> 17:20.300
Did you see
the defendant

17:20.343 --> 17:21.692
come up from the basement?

17:21.736 --> 17:23.781
It doesn't matter
how many times you ask me,

17:23.825 --> 17:25.174
I can't remember.

17:29.222 --> 17:30.832
Kovalev got to Francesca.

17:30.875 --> 17:32.268
We've lost our witness.

17:32.312 --> 17:34.662
No, we've lost our case.

17:41.321 --> 17:43.062
[sighs]
All right.

17:43.105 --> 17:45.281
There's only one way to win now.
You know what we need to do.

17:45.325 --> 17:47.022
Yeah, I'll go back to the
witnesses from the coffee shop.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.328
See if I can get someone
to change their mind

17:48.371 --> 17:49.894
about testifying.

17:49.938 --> 17:51.592
So Kovalev can scare them
the way he scared Francesca?

17:51.635 --> 17:54.464
Fine, I'll put Agent Cooke
on the stand.

17:54.508 --> 17:56.379
She wasn't inside. Won't work.

17:56.423 --> 17:58.468
I'll call an expert witness.
Someone from the task force

17:58.512 --> 18:00.427
investigating
the Kovalev operation.

18:00.470 --> 18:01.776
Won't work.

18:01.819 --> 18:03.995
I know you don't like this,

18:04.039 --> 18:06.955
but there's only one witness
who can put Kovalev in prison.

18:11.525 --> 18:13.396
In exchange for your testimony,

18:13.440 --> 18:16.660
the government is willing to
reduce your current sentence

18:16.704 --> 18:19.359
from ten years to four.

18:19.402 --> 18:20.795
I thought you guys came to play.

18:20.838 --> 18:22.362
It's a decent deal.

18:22.405 --> 18:26.017
I want better than decent,
or you can find another witness.

18:29.238 --> 18:30.892
Fine. One year.

18:30.935 --> 18:32.502
That is as low
as I'll go.

18:32.546 --> 18:34.504
No. I want out today.

18:34.548 --> 18:35.810
BULL:
A year is nothing.

18:35.853 --> 18:38.073
It'll pass in the blink
of an eye.

18:38.943 --> 18:41.337
I am not gonna make it a year.

18:41.381 --> 18:42.991
They're gonna kill me in here.

18:43.034 --> 18:44.297
You should have
thought of that

18:44.340 --> 18:45.559
before you broke the law.

18:45.602 --> 18:47.909
I kept the streets safe
for kids.

18:47.952 --> 18:49.824
I put criminals away.

18:49.867 --> 18:51.869
I put my life
on the line every day

18:51.913 --> 18:53.871
and barely made
more than minimum wage.

18:54.742 --> 18:56.526
I just took
what I deserved.

18:56.570 --> 18:58.615
You deserve prison time.

19:00.748 --> 19:04.491
Look, my dad has
advanced Alzheimer's.

19:04.534 --> 19:07.015
I couldn't take care
of him on my salary.

19:07.058 --> 19:10.192
The federal government doesn't
need that money. My dad did.

19:10.236 --> 19:11.846
What does it matter?

19:11.889 --> 19:14.936
It matters because you took
an oath. The same one I did.

19:14.979 --> 19:18.853
And if it's meaningless to one,
it's meaningless to all.

19:21.464 --> 19:23.074
Today.

19:27.949 --> 19:30.081
You're lucky there's someone
out there he wants to put away

19:30.125 --> 19:31.605
more than you.

19:36.827 --> 19:38.612
You owe me. Big-time.

19:38.655 --> 19:40.222
Why?

19:40.266 --> 19:43.225
My call to my Homeland contact
turned into a two-hour lunch.

19:43.269 --> 19:45.575
He kept on trying to sit
on my side of the booth

19:45.619 --> 19:47.098
for "security reasons."

19:47.142 --> 19:49.362
Wasn't fun.Did you at least get

19:49.405 --> 19:50.928
anything out of it?Yeah.

19:50.972 --> 19:52.930
He ran the Olek photo
through facial recognition.

19:52.974 --> 19:55.237
He hasn't boarded any flights
since the murder.

19:55.281 --> 19:56.760
He's not in Warsaw.

19:56.804 --> 19:57.674
Well, the DEA's looking
in the wrong direction.

19:57.718 --> 19:58.806
I got to text them.

19:58.849 --> 19:59.981
MARISSA:
I just got word from Bull.

20:00.024 --> 20:01.330
Agent Scott is cooperating.

20:01.374 --> 20:02.940
Bull and Reilly
are prepping him tonight.

20:02.984 --> 20:05.116
We don't need Olek for trial?

20:05.160 --> 20:07.249
Oh, no. If we can find Olek,
we want him.

20:07.293 --> 20:08.685
Scott's an eyewitness,

20:08.729 --> 20:09.947
but he's also corrupt.[phone chimes]

20:09.991 --> 20:10.948
The jury might not think
his word

20:10.992 --> 20:12.123
is enough to convict.

20:12.167 --> 20:13.560
Damn it.

20:13.603 --> 20:15.344
Well, the DEA's not gonna be
much use finding him.

20:15.388 --> 20:16.824
Why not?

20:16.867 --> 20:18.042
Taylor got a tip
from Homeland

20:18.086 --> 20:20.610
that Olek hasn't
left the country.

20:20.654 --> 20:22.960
I passed the intel on
to my DEA guy

20:23.004 --> 20:24.832
and all he said is,
"I'll look into it."

20:24.875 --> 20:25.963
You know what that means.

20:26.007 --> 20:27.226
"Don't call us, we'll call you."

20:27.269 --> 20:28.836
Yep, the bureaucratic
kiss-off.

20:28.879 --> 20:29.837
They're never gonna
find Olek if they keep

20:29.880 --> 20:31.099
dicking around Warsaw.

20:31.142 --> 20:32.187
Hold up.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.623
You've been helping

20:33.667 --> 20:35.016
with the search
for Olek?

20:35.886 --> 20:37.627
All I did was make a phone call.

20:37.671 --> 20:39.499
And eat too much green curry

20:39.542 --> 20:40.761
with an annoying
ex-colleague.

20:40.804 --> 20:41.979
But I'm back
on the bench,

20:42.023 --> 20:43.329
where I'm supposed to be.No, no, no.

20:43.372 --> 20:44.373
I don't want you on the bench.

20:44.417 --> 20:45.809
You heard Danny.The DEA

20:45.853 --> 20:47.768
is not gonna find Olek
on their own.

20:48.551 --> 20:49.639
Well,
you heard Reilly.

20:49.683 --> 20:50.945
If I'm involved

20:50.988 --> 20:52.425
in the investigation,
it could get tainted.

20:52.468 --> 20:54.165
Maybe, maybe not. Reilly
is not right about everything.

20:54.209 --> 20:55.689
He thought Bull was a criminal.

20:55.732 --> 20:57.038
You said you were past that.

20:57.081 --> 21:00.259
I lied.
We need to find Olek, Taylor.

21:04.175 --> 21:05.960
Oh, who am I kidding?
I hate being on the bench.

21:06.003 --> 21:08.179
I'm in.He's not at any
of his known locations,

21:08.223 --> 21:11.270
and his cell and credit cards
have gone dark.

21:11.313 --> 21:14.577
Someone connected to Kovalev
must know where Olek is.

21:14.621 --> 21:16.405
Sure. Let's just stroll

21:16.449 --> 21:17.885
on into Kovalev territory
and say,

21:17.928 --> 21:19.930
"Hey, has anybody seen Olek?"

21:20.757 --> 21:24.761
Actually, that's exactly
what we'll do.

21:26.067 --> 21:28.287
[song in foreign language
playing]

21:39.733 --> 21:41.169
DANNY:Hello.

21:43.650 --> 21:45.521
I'm a private investigator.

21:45.565 --> 21:48.307
I'm looking for
a man named Olek.

21:51.397 --> 21:52.876
Okay.

22:03.017 --> 22:04.366
I'm looking for Olek.

22:04.410 --> 22:05.715
He's a friend of Kovalev's.

22:07.456 --> 22:09.110
No English.

22:10.851 --> 22:12.113
Well, if you see
him, let him know

22:12.156 --> 22:14.289
Alexis Woods is
looking for him.

22:26.823 --> 22:30.131
I knew it was Kovalev
right away.

22:30.174 --> 22:31.567
How's that?

22:31.611 --> 22:33.395
His picture's been hanging up
in the DEA's office

22:33.439 --> 22:35.310
as long as I can remember.

22:35.354 --> 22:38.095
Besides, you don't
forget a face like his.

22:38.139 --> 22:39.314
What do you mean?

22:39.358 --> 22:40.707
SCOTT:
He just looks

22:40.750 --> 22:42.622
like a criminal, you know?

22:42.665 --> 22:44.275
And you have
particular experience

22:44.319 --> 22:45.755
knowing what
a criminal looks like?

22:45.799 --> 22:47.366
[clears throat]
Oh, yeah.

22:47.409 --> 22:50.934
I've busted dozens of crooks.
They're all the same.

22:50.978 --> 22:54.024
[exhales] Must be hard,
working around scum like that.

22:54.068 --> 22:55.722
Reilly.

22:55.765 --> 22:57.593
I do what I can for
the good of the country.

22:57.637 --> 23:00.248
That's what really inspired me
to put my life on the line

23:00.291 --> 23:02.119
every day, you know?That's what inspired you?

23:02.163 --> 23:04.774
Not the cash?Okay.

23:04.818 --> 23:05.949
Excuse me?Stealing cash
from the scenes.

23:05.993 --> 23:06.950
Isn't that what really

23:06.994 --> 23:08.082
inspired you every day?

23:08.125 --> 23:09.605
BULL:
Hey. Agent Scott.

23:09.649 --> 23:12.086
Give us a minute.

23:12.129 --> 23:14.915
In fact,
we're gonna take five.

23:19.180 --> 23:22.096
You do realize Scott's
testifying for us?

23:22.139 --> 23:23.619
I know. I won't
ask those questions

23:23.663 --> 23:25.316
in front of the jury, obviously.

23:25.360 --> 23:28.581
Obviously, because the jury
is gonna sense your contempt.

23:28.624 --> 23:30.104
You need to find a way
to hide it.

23:30.147 --> 23:33.281
I just can't stomach
that Captain America schtick.

23:33.324 --> 23:34.456
The hypocrisy of it all.

23:34.500 --> 23:35.936
Reilly, the world
is not a binary place.

23:35.979 --> 23:38.242
It as a gray and messy place.

23:38.286 --> 23:39.940
A place where Scott, yes,
is a criminal,

23:39.983 --> 23:41.768
but he's also a man
who's done some good.

23:41.811 --> 23:45.772
In theory, I get that,
but when I see his smug face

23:45.815 --> 23:47.208
going on about his love

23:47.251 --> 23:48.688
of his country,
I want to punch him.

23:48.731 --> 23:50.907
Well, if Scott's face
is the problem,

23:50.951 --> 23:52.300
then replace it with another.

23:52.343 --> 23:53.344
What do you mean?

23:53.388 --> 23:55.129
Try this visualization
technique.

23:55.172 --> 23:56.478
When you're
facing Scott,

23:56.522 --> 23:59.263
picture someone
you trust implicitly.

23:59.307 --> 24:00.569
You think that'll work?

24:00.613 --> 24:02.353
It better.

24:03.224 --> 24:04.834
REILLY:
Why did you become

24:04.878 --> 24:07.446
a DEA Agent, Mr. Scott?

24:07.489 --> 24:10.666
I got into this line of work
because of men like Kovalev.

24:10.710 --> 24:13.626
Because you wanted
to clean the streets?

24:13.669 --> 24:15.802
Yes.And protect Americans?

24:15.845 --> 24:16.933
Yes.

24:16.977 --> 24:18.413
In doing so,

24:18.457 --> 24:21.024
did you ever place
your own life in harm's way?

24:21.068 --> 24:22.548
Every day.

24:22.591 --> 24:25.507
Weren't you, in fact,
injured in the line of duty?

24:26.552 --> 24:28.989
I was shot right here,
in the shoulder.

24:29.032 --> 24:30.817
REILLY:Despite this harm
and the risk

24:30.860 --> 24:34.516
of being shot, you proudly
went to work every day?

24:34.560 --> 24:36.866
I did.Why is that?

24:38.651 --> 24:41.871
Because I took an oath
to protect this country.

24:43.830 --> 24:46.180
No further questions.

24:48.574 --> 24:52.752
Well, look at you. Turned
a corrupt cop into a Boy Scout.

24:55.189 --> 24:56.495
We're done here.
You can take him.

24:56.538 --> 24:58.235
[indistinct radio chatter]

25:02.718 --> 25:03.806
It's a bust.

25:03.850 --> 25:05.416
No one's taking the bait.It'll work.

25:05.460 --> 25:07.506
Once Olek learns someone's
asking about him,

25:07.549 --> 25:08.811
he'll check the fake website.

25:08.855 --> 25:11.379
It's classic curiosity
killed the cat.

25:11.422 --> 25:13.250
My cat's too smart to let
her curiosity kill her.

25:13.294 --> 25:14.556
[computer beeping]

25:14.600 --> 25:17.646
Well, someone's not that smart.

25:17.690 --> 25:19.692
DANNY: Someone's
accessing the site?As we speak.

25:19.735 --> 25:22.521
And that means my malware is
being dumped onto their system.

25:22.564 --> 25:23.783
Okay, what does the malware do?

25:23.826 --> 25:25.611
It gives me access
to the computer

25:25.654 --> 25:29.658
of whoever's visiting the
site, including their webcam.

25:34.097 --> 25:35.359
It's the guy I gave my card to.

25:35.403 --> 25:36.752
Between you and me,

25:36.796 --> 25:38.101
I should have given him
a breath mint.

25:38.145 --> 25:39.929
MAN:
Olek?

25:39.973 --> 25:42.323
[speaking Polish]

25:52.420 --> 25:54.335
Any chance he told Olek
to check out our site?

25:54.378 --> 25:56.032
No idea.
But I don't need him to.

25:56.076 --> 25:58.731
I can mine this guy's computer
and hack his recent call log.

25:58.774 --> 26:00.428
And that'll get you
Olek's number?

26:00.471 --> 26:03.126
He drew us a map
straight to Olek.

26:04.606 --> 26:06.913
That was
an impressive turnaround.

26:06.956 --> 26:09.089
So tell me,

26:09.132 --> 26:12.614
whose face did you picture
instead of Scott?

26:12.658 --> 26:15.748
The only face that's never
let me down. Finch.

26:15.791 --> 26:17.750
[whimpers]

26:17.793 --> 26:19.708
Ah. Man's best friend.

26:19.752 --> 26:21.928
In some cases,
man's only friend.

26:21.971 --> 26:23.494
[chuckles]

26:24.974 --> 26:27.107
I know it's not easy for you.

26:27.150 --> 26:29.283
Having to turn Scott
into a hero.

26:29.326 --> 26:32.591
It feels strange to say, but it
wasn't as hard as I expected.

26:32.634 --> 26:35.594
Is that what's bothering you?

26:36.595 --> 26:38.335
When a government official
goes corrupt,

26:38.379 --> 26:40.773
it's not usually
one big dramatic move.

26:40.816 --> 26:43.993
It's small steps. Each time
there's a justification

26:44.037 --> 26:45.342
for moving the line.

26:45.386 --> 26:48.607
"I need it." "I deserve it."

26:48.650 --> 26:50.652
Until they can't see
who they've become.

26:50.696 --> 26:52.480
People rationalize
their behavior

26:52.523 --> 26:54.351
to make it acceptable
to themselves.

26:54.395 --> 26:55.962
I thought I'd never
have to worry about

26:56.005 --> 26:57.572
that kind of slippery slope,

26:57.616 --> 26:59.705
if I never got out onto the
slope in the first place.

26:59.748 --> 27:02.359
And tonight, you stepped
out onto the slope.

27:02.403 --> 27:05.406
I did, and I was fine.

27:05.449 --> 27:07.147
The world didn't crumble.

27:07.190 --> 27:09.366
That kind of terrifies me.

27:09.410 --> 27:12.326
What step will I take next?

27:12.369 --> 27:13.893
[knocking on door]

27:13.936 --> 27:14.981
We found Olek.

27:15.024 --> 27:15.721
What?

27:15.764 --> 27:16.765
Without the DEA's help.

27:16.809 --> 27:18.288
Well, where is he?

27:18.332 --> 27:19.681
I tracked his burner phone
to this neighborhood.

27:19.725 --> 27:21.161
Ms. Rentzel,
I made it crystal clear

27:21.204 --> 27:22.249
that you were to stay away
from the investigation.

27:22.292 --> 27:23.859
There's no warrant
in place.

27:23.903 --> 27:25.208
Whatever you've captured
is completely inadmissible.

27:25.252 --> 27:27.384
I can't...He's on Scott's street.

27:27.428 --> 27:29.560
He's gonna try
to take Scott out.

27:29.604 --> 27:30.692
Call the marshal.

27:30.736 --> 27:32.563
[siren wailing]

27:32.607 --> 27:34.565
[indistinct radio chatter]

27:34.609 --> 27:36.829
[tires screeching]

27:41.921 --> 27:43.313
What happened?

27:43.357 --> 27:45.054
Scott went into the backyard
to have a cigarette.

27:45.098 --> 27:48.536
We heard a shot, ran out,
found Scott on the ground.

27:48.579 --> 27:50.059
He's still breathing, but...

27:50.886 --> 27:53.367
...it looks bad.

27:53.410 --> 27:55.151
Olek got to him.

28:01.810 --> 28:03.812
[elevator bell chimes]What's Scott's status?

28:03.856 --> 28:05.553
He's alive,
but in a coma.

28:05.596 --> 28:06.685
[sighs]Will he recover?

28:06.728 --> 28:07.860
It's too early to tell.

28:07.903 --> 28:09.122
As of now, doctors
are giving him

28:09.165 --> 28:11.211
a five percent
chance to wake up.

28:16.085 --> 28:19.654
[sighs] Do we know
where Olek is now?

28:19.698 --> 28:22.744
I lost his signal not long
after Scott was shot.

28:22.788 --> 28:25.312
DANNY:Olek's been hiding for a
while. Wouldn't surprise me

28:25.355 --> 28:27.140
if he routinely changes
burner phones.

28:27.183 --> 28:28.924
What about the gun
found at the scene?

28:28.968 --> 28:30.404
Any connection to Olek?

28:30.447 --> 28:31.622
REILLY:
Ghost gun.

28:31.666 --> 28:34.713
Untraceable.CHUNK:
If we can't find Olek,

28:34.756 --> 28:35.888
and Agent Scott's
out of commission,

28:35.931 --> 28:37.367
this prosecution's over.

28:37.411 --> 28:39.413
Kovalev's team
will easily

28:39.456 --> 28:40.588
have this case dismissed.

28:40.631 --> 28:42.851
REILLY:
And he'll have added
another body

28:42.895 --> 28:44.635
to his tally--
this time, on my watch.

28:44.679 --> 28:45.898
DANNY:
He had security.

28:45.941 --> 28:46.942
This isn't on you.

28:46.986 --> 28:48.117
I hate that Kovalev's gonna

28:48.161 --> 28:49.466
get away with this.

28:54.297 --> 28:57.474
He won't get away with it
if we have Scott testify.

28:57.518 --> 28:58.606
TAYLOR:
How?

28:58.649 --> 29:00.869
We recorded his prep.

29:00.913 --> 29:03.654
Of course. We can use that.

29:03.698 --> 29:05.308
Isn't that hearsay?

29:05.352 --> 29:06.832
Technically, yeah.

29:06.875 --> 29:09.312
But there's an exception
called forfeiture by wrongdoing

29:09.356 --> 29:11.532
that allows you to enter
hearsay into evidence

29:11.575 --> 29:13.099
if it's the other side's fault

29:13.142 --> 29:14.448
that our witness
isn't available.

29:14.491 --> 29:18.234
I'd say a coma qualifies
as unavailable.

29:19.932 --> 29:22.108
What happened to Agent
Scott is a tragedy.

29:22.151 --> 29:23.936
But Mr. Kovalev had
nothing to do with it.

29:23.979 --> 29:25.720
You can't be serious.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.766
The night before Scott
is set to testify

29:27.809 --> 29:29.115
against your client, he's shot?

29:29.158 --> 29:31.378
Who do you think did it?
The Tooth Fairy?

29:31.421 --> 29:33.249
Dr. Bull.LAMONT:
Need I remind the court

29:33.293 --> 29:34.337
and Dr. Bull

29:34.381 --> 29:35.469
that Agent Scott

29:35.512 --> 29:36.818
routinely put
notorious criminals away.

29:36.862 --> 29:38.820
Yes, like your client.

29:38.864 --> 29:40.648
And Agent Scott
is an admitted thief.

29:40.691 --> 29:42.824
This is a man
who has many enemies.

29:42.868 --> 29:44.434
REILLY:Judge, with all
due respect,

29:44.478 --> 29:48.525
the timing of Scott's shooting
can't be a coincidence.

29:48.569 --> 29:51.224
Obviously Kovalev ordered
the hit, and therefore,

29:51.267 --> 29:53.487
under the forfeiture
by wrongdoing rule,

29:53.530 --> 29:55.358
we should be allowed to use
the recorded testimony

29:55.402 --> 29:56.795
of Agent Scott.

29:56.838 --> 29:59.101
Do you have any evidence
of Kovalev's involvement?

29:59.145 --> 30:00.711
Not directly,
but we have reason to believe

30:00.755 --> 30:04.890
that Kovalev's associate Olek
acted under his orders.

30:04.933 --> 30:06.630
I don't know any Olek.

30:07.544 --> 30:08.981
Do you have any evidence
to support

30:09.024 --> 30:11.461
your theory
that this Olek shot Scott?

30:11.505 --> 30:13.899
Nothing admissible right now,
but we're working on it.

30:13.942 --> 30:16.205
NOLAN: I agree the
timing is curious.

30:16.249 --> 30:19.208
But it doesn't matter what you
or even I might suspect.

30:19.252 --> 30:21.080
Without something
to hang my hat on,

30:21.123 --> 30:23.386
I can't find that
Kovalev's responsible

30:23.430 --> 30:24.866
for making Agent Scott
unavailable.

30:24.910 --> 30:26.563
LAMONT: Judge Nolan,
we'd like to move

30:26.607 --> 30:27.782
for a directed verdict

30:27.826 --> 30:29.218
in favor of
the defendant.

30:29.262 --> 30:30.567
BULL:Now wait a minute.
If Your Honor

30:30.611 --> 30:33.179
won't let the video
of Agent Scott in,

30:33.222 --> 30:36.399
we would like to bring
Scott himself in to testify.

30:37.792 --> 30:41.100
There's a chance Agent Scott
might be well enough to testify?

30:41.143 --> 30:42.449
BULL:
Yes, but he needs rest

30:42.492 --> 30:45.669
rest at the moment.
Give us two weeks.

30:45.713 --> 30:49.586
NOLAN:
Mr. Reilly, two weeks
sound right to you?

30:49.630 --> 30:51.719
Yes. Yes, it does.

30:51.762 --> 30:54.678
We just lied to a judge.
A federal judge, at that.

30:54.722 --> 30:56.115
Okay...I could be censured.

30:56.158 --> 30:58.726
We didn't lie. We left things
open to interpretation.

30:58.769 --> 31:00.032
Come on.

31:00.075 --> 31:02.121
Look, Judge Nolan asked
if there was a chance

31:02.164 --> 31:04.210
Scott would be
able to testify,

31:04.253 --> 31:05.776
and I answered truthfully.

31:05.820 --> 31:07.604
Yes, there's a chance.

31:07.648 --> 31:08.910
A five percent chance.

31:08.954 --> 31:10.346
He didn't ask
if it was a good chance.

31:11.260 --> 31:12.914
I guess you weren't
technically lying

31:12.958 --> 31:15.743
to the judge when you
said Scott needed rest.

31:15.786 --> 31:18.180
No, I wasn't.Okay.

31:18.224 --> 31:20.530
We bought time. For what?

31:20.574 --> 31:21.923
[sighs]

31:21.967 --> 31:24.404
Well, we need to find
evidence that Kovalev

31:24.447 --> 31:26.580
ordered a hit on Scott.

31:26.623 --> 31:29.148
What about that burner phone
that Taylor captured?

31:29.191 --> 31:33.108
Maybe we can use that to get
Olek to flip on Kovalev?

31:33.152 --> 31:35.067
The burner evidence
is inadmissible.

31:35.110 --> 31:36.329
Olek won't
know that.

31:36.372 --> 31:38.026
And once he flips,
it won't matter.

31:38.070 --> 31:40.246
He becomes our evidence.

31:41.377 --> 31:42.596
Okay.

31:42.639 --> 31:44.728
How do we flip Olek
if we can't find him?

31:44.772 --> 31:47.949
Well, I know someone
who happens to be very good

31:47.993 --> 31:50.343
at finding an Olek
in a haystack.

31:51.213 --> 31:53.563
But you might have to do
a little bit of groveling first.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.262
[sighs]

31:58.003 --> 31:59.787
Ms. Rentzel?

31:59.830 --> 32:01.397
I owe you an apology.

32:01.441 --> 32:04.096
I should've included you in the
investigation from the outset.

32:04.139 --> 32:05.706
It's fine. I get it.

32:05.749 --> 32:07.969
You were just doing what you
thought was best for the case.

32:08.013 --> 32:10.972
Any new leads on
Olek's current location?

32:11.016 --> 32:14.280
Not yet. But I recorded
this man's call to Olek.

32:14.323 --> 32:16.108
It's how I found
his burner phone.

32:16.151 --> 32:17.109
MARISSA:I just finished running
their conversation

32:17.152 --> 32:18.458
through a translator.

32:18.501 --> 32:20.112
He asks Olek

32:20.155 --> 32:22.984
if he is still in "the bowels
of the greedy tiger."

32:23.028 --> 32:24.116
The bowels of the greedy tiger?

32:24.159 --> 32:26.727
It might be a Polish expression

32:26.770 --> 32:28.250
for "jeopardy."

32:28.294 --> 32:30.165
Maybe it's not a metaphor.
There is a convenience store

32:30.209 --> 32:33.299
in Kovalev's neighborhood
called The Greedy Tiger.

32:33.342 --> 32:36.128
I wonder if bowels means
he's staying in the basement?

32:36.171 --> 32:38.434
I'll send a team there
right away.

32:38.478 --> 32:40.697
DANNY:
Judge Nolan's
chambers called.

32:40.741 --> 32:42.177
There's a problem.

32:43.787 --> 32:46.007
NOLAN:An affidavit from
Agent Scott's doctor.

32:46.051 --> 32:47.748
Courtesy of Ms. Lamont.

32:47.791 --> 32:51.708
Don't bother, Mr. Reilly.
It's very easy to sum up.

32:51.752 --> 32:53.667
Agent Scott won't
be able to testify

32:53.710 --> 32:55.147
in two weeks
because he's in a coma

32:55.190 --> 32:57.845
with very little chance
of recovery.

32:57.888 --> 32:59.325
So little, in fact, his family

32:59.368 --> 33:00.891
is pulling the plug
this afternoon.

33:00.935 --> 33:02.981
Hmm. Well, then,
Agent Scott's death

33:03.024 --> 33:04.591
will be on your client's hands.

33:04.634 --> 33:07.028
Where is the evidence?
The only evidence I see

33:07.072 --> 33:09.291
is that you and Mr. Reilly
falsely claimed

33:09.335 --> 33:11.032
Scott would be able to testify.

33:11.076 --> 33:12.599
I never said that.
I did not lie.

33:12.642 --> 33:15.036
Enough. Mr. Reilly?

33:15.080 --> 33:16.603
Judge, I'm-I'm sorry
if I misled the court,

33:16.646 --> 33:19.519
but I have an update that
makes this whole issue moot.

33:19.562 --> 33:22.174
We've located Olek,
the man we believe

33:22.217 --> 33:24.089
Kovalev ordered
to shoot Agent Scott.

33:24.132 --> 33:25.699
Well, where is this mystery man?

33:25.742 --> 33:28.223
We only need a few hours
to arrest him and meet with him.

33:29.268 --> 33:31.618
You snowed me for time
once before, Mr. Reilly.

33:31.661 --> 33:32.706
Why should I
believe you now?

33:32.749 --> 33:34.316
This man we're arresting, Olek,

33:34.360 --> 33:36.884
he can testify
as to both Scott's

33:36.927 --> 33:38.625
and Babiack's murders.

33:38.668 --> 33:41.889
But as you stand here now, you
haven't yet arrested this Olek.

33:41.932 --> 33:43.499
So you have no evidence

33:43.543 --> 33:45.806
that Kovalev had anything to do
with Agent Scott's death.

33:46.850 --> 33:47.938
Without Scott, you
have no evidence

33:47.982 --> 33:49.853
that Kovalev murdered Babiack.

33:50.767 --> 33:52.204
I have no choice

33:52.247 --> 33:55.120
but to grant Ms. Lamont's motion
and dismiss this case.

33:55.163 --> 33:56.251
Let's go to court

33:56.295 --> 33:58.079
and put it on the record.Please.

33:58.123 --> 34:00.473
You can't let Kovalev
get away with this.

34:00.516 --> 34:03.084
I'm sorry, Mr. Reilly.
You've left me no other option.

34:03.128 --> 34:04.564
Don't do this.

34:04.607 --> 34:06.957
Mr. Reilly, please move.

34:08.263 --> 34:10.309
Come on. Let's get
this wrapped up.

34:16.576 --> 34:17.751
What the hell?

34:17.794 --> 34:19.579
[grunts]
Son of a bitch.

34:19.622 --> 34:20.884
That's one way to object.

34:26.151 --> 34:27.456
BULL:Your Honor, let's
take a breath.

34:27.500 --> 34:29.458
Let's take a breath?
I just got sucker punched

34:29.502 --> 34:31.112
in my own chambers.

34:31.156 --> 34:32.766
You can forget about
going to court.

34:32.809 --> 34:35.247
I'm gonna sign an order of
dismissal right here, right now.

34:35.290 --> 34:38.119
Clearly, A.U.S.A.
Reilly is having

34:38.163 --> 34:39.903
some sort of mental breakdown.

34:39.947 --> 34:41.992
But please don't
dismiss this case.

34:42.036 --> 34:43.211
Not, at least,
until you've heard

34:43.255 --> 34:44.299
the argument as to
why you shouldn't.

34:44.343 --> 34:45.344
Argument
from what attorney?

34:45.387 --> 34:46.649
I'm not letting this maniac

34:46.693 --> 34:48.042
back into my courtroom.

34:48.086 --> 34:50.436
I can have an attorney here
by the end of the day.

34:50.479 --> 34:52.177
Chester Palmer.Okay, clearly,

34:52.220 --> 34:53.656
this is just another
stall tactic.

34:53.700 --> 34:56.137
If you dismiss this case now,
Kovalev walks.

34:56.181 --> 34:58.661
Until he is inevitably
brought to trial again.

34:58.705 --> 35:00.185
He just killed
a witness.

35:00.228 --> 35:03.405
Who's next? A juror? A judge?

35:04.667 --> 35:06.887
Have Mr. Palmer here
by the end of the day.

35:06.930 --> 35:09.150
As for you,
Mr. Reilly,

35:09.194 --> 35:11.109
I never want to see
your face in my chambers

35:11.152 --> 35:12.849
or courtroom again.

35:12.893 --> 35:14.460
Understood.Get him out of here.

35:14.503 --> 35:16.549
He can cool off
in a holding cell.

35:16.592 --> 35:18.116
OFFICER:
Yes, Your Honor.

35:19.726 --> 35:21.162
You went full opera.

35:21.206 --> 35:24.557
Make it worth it.
Lock Kovalev up.

35:26.733 --> 35:28.996
[dog barking]

35:33.566 --> 35:35.394
Hey, Olek.

35:38.919 --> 35:40.616
Get on the ground.

35:42.096 --> 35:43.924
Hands behind your back.

35:46.187 --> 35:47.406
[handcuffs clicking]

35:47.449 --> 35:49.234
You have the right
to remain silent.

35:50.278 --> 35:52.672
We can place you
near Agent Scott's street

35:52.715 --> 35:54.587
minutes before he was shot.

35:55.588 --> 35:57.155
Okay.
[laughs]

35:59.244 --> 36:02.421
Look, you're not the one
we want, Olek.

36:02.464 --> 36:06.903
I've been deputized by the DOJ
to offer you a one-time deal:

36:06.947 --> 36:08.688
admit that Kovalev

36:08.731 --> 36:11.734
ordered the hit on
Agent Scott, admit that

36:11.778 --> 36:15.216
it was your gun at the scene,

36:15.260 --> 36:17.827
and you're a free man.

36:18.915 --> 36:20.874
I have nothing to say.

36:20.917 --> 36:23.746
Scott was a federal agent.

36:23.790 --> 36:26.227
That's a capital offense.

36:26.271 --> 36:28.316
That's the death penalty.

36:28.360 --> 36:30.710
Use your head, Olek.

36:30.753 --> 36:32.625
Give Kovalev up.

36:35.018 --> 36:37.282
Are you afraid he's gonna
have you killed, too?

36:37.325 --> 36:39.719
Because we can
offer you protection.

36:40.589 --> 36:42.809
Kovalev would not kill me.

36:44.158 --> 36:46.726
He knows you can bring him down.

36:48.293 --> 36:50.817
Kovalev is not a bad man.

36:50.860 --> 36:52.340
People fear him.

36:52.384 --> 36:56.126
I do not know why,
but they do.

36:56.170 --> 36:58.520
Maybe your friend,

36:58.564 --> 37:02.872
this, um, Agent Scott,

37:02.916 --> 37:07.355
maybe he feared testifying
against Kovalev.

37:07.399 --> 37:11.664
Maybe he feared so much,
he take his own life.

37:11.707 --> 37:14.493
I don't know.
Maybe it was his gun you found.

37:14.536 --> 37:15.972
Maybe he pull trigger.

37:16.016 --> 37:19.106
Okay. I don't have time
for this garbage, man.

37:19.149 --> 37:20.499
Shame, really.

37:21.630 --> 37:25.373
Kovalev never would have
harmed him.

37:26.287 --> 37:28.594
Kovalev would never harm anyone.

37:30.378 --> 37:31.379
REILLY:
Did we get him?

37:31.423 --> 37:32.685
We got Olek,

37:32.728 --> 37:34.556
but he won't flip on Kovalev.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.689
He even had the gall
to say that Agent Scott

37:36.732 --> 37:39.387
was so scared of Kovalev
that he killed himself.

37:39.431 --> 37:40.954
That's absurd.

37:40.997 --> 37:43.304
Yeah.

37:43.348 --> 37:45.567
This forfeiture
by wrongdoing rule,

37:45.611 --> 37:47.395
does it define wrongdoing?

37:47.439 --> 37:48.875
Not in the
rule itself.

37:48.918 --> 37:51.704
It could be harm,
threat of harm, really anything

37:51.747 --> 37:54.750
intended to discourage the
witness from testifying. Why?

37:55.664 --> 37:57.971
Well, maybe Olek has a point.

37:59.842 --> 38:01.888
Maybe Olek does have a point.

38:03.324 --> 38:05.108
What point?

38:05.152 --> 38:07.285
Your Honor, we have uncovered
some last-minute evidence

38:07.328 --> 38:09.548
that we believe...Mr. Palmer, I'm gonna
cut to the chase here,

38:09.591 --> 38:11.767
because I'm a little tired
of the government's games.

38:11.811 --> 38:14.117
Do you have any evidence
of any kind that shows

38:14.161 --> 38:16.294
the defendant tried
to have Scott killed?

38:16.337 --> 38:17.991
No, Your Honor.

38:18.034 --> 38:19.862
NOLAN: Then because there is
no wrongdoing by Mr. Kovalev,

38:19.906 --> 38:22.082
Agent Scott's video testimony
can't come in,

38:22.125 --> 38:25.259
and this case is dismissed
for lack of evidence.

38:25.303 --> 38:26.652
CHUNK:
If Your Honor
will indulge me,

38:26.695 --> 38:28.306
that is not
an accurate statement.

38:28.349 --> 38:29.785
We have evidence

38:29.829 --> 38:32.353
that Mr. Kovalev committed
a wrongdoing that made

38:32.397 --> 38:33.572
our witness
unavailable.

38:33.615 --> 38:35.095
What wrongdoing?Your Honor,

38:35.138 --> 38:36.966
we have a statement
from Mr. Kovalev's associate

38:37.010 --> 38:39.795
that Agent Scott shot himself
because he feared Mr. Kovalev.

38:39.839 --> 38:41.884
Now, we believe
Mr. Kovalev's wrongdoing

38:41.928 --> 38:44.496
in this instance is
creating an atmosphere

38:44.539 --> 38:46.585
of paranoia a-and fear,

38:46.628 --> 38:48.238
with the sole purpose

38:48.282 --> 38:51.503
of wrongfully scaring Agent
Scott into harming himself.

38:51.546 --> 38:54.244
Objection. I-I can't
even state a precise basis

38:54.288 --> 38:55.594
for this objection

38:55.637 --> 38:56.986
because I've never heard
such a wild argument

38:57.030 --> 38:58.640
in open court before.

38:58.684 --> 39:01.034
Your Honor, may we approach?

39:01.077 --> 39:02.818
Oh, why the hell not?

39:11.436 --> 39:12.959
Your Honor, you
asked for a showing

39:13.002 --> 39:15.831
of wrongdoing,
something to hang your hat on

39:15.875 --> 39:17.964
in order to enter into
evidence Agent Scott's

39:18.007 --> 39:21.663
truthful and extremely
relevant testimony.

39:21.707 --> 39:25.493
Testimony he would otherwise
have given himself,

39:25.537 --> 39:28.235
if it were not
for the defendant.

39:28.278 --> 39:29.845
But here it is.

39:29.889 --> 39:31.412
A wrongdoing.

39:33.240 --> 39:34.850
Hang your hat.

39:35.938 --> 39:37.810
REILLY:
And after Babiack and Olek

39:37.853 --> 39:40.508
began to argue,
what happened next?

39:40.552 --> 39:42.467
Kovalev pulled this gun
out of his jacket

39:42.510 --> 39:44.338
and shot Babiack dead.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.514
He didn't hesitate.

39:46.558 --> 39:49.474
He just shot him,
like it was no big deal.

39:49.517 --> 39:52.433
That is the kind of monster
that Kovalev is.

39:58.570 --> 40:00.528
Has the jury reached a verdict?

40:00.572 --> 40:02.008
We have, Your Honor.

40:02.051 --> 40:05.359
We the jury find the defendant
Danilo Kovalev

40:05.403 --> 40:08.014
guilty on all counts.

40:11.365 --> 40:13.411
You better get
me out of this.

40:13.454 --> 40:15.630
You hear me?

40:26.162 --> 40:28.817
Well, look who's a free man.

40:28.861 --> 40:31.994
Well, not free enough to go
into Judge Nolan's courtroom,

40:32.038 --> 40:33.169
but free nonetheless.

40:33.213 --> 40:34.519
Thank you.

40:34.562 --> 40:36.434
For all you and your team
did for this case.

40:36.477 --> 40:37.957
Because of you,

40:38.000 --> 40:40.394
Kovalev is gonna spend the rest
of his life behind bars.

40:40.438 --> 40:41.526
What about you?

40:41.569 --> 40:42.875
I will probably
be censured.

40:42.918 --> 40:46.574
Definitely kicked
down the career ladder.

40:46.618 --> 40:48.315
Guessing I'll be on
misdemeanor duty for a while.

40:48.358 --> 40:49.882
I'm sorry to hear that.

40:49.925 --> 40:51.100
Don't be sorry.

40:51.144 --> 40:53.494
I should be disciplined.
I punched a judge.

40:53.538 --> 40:54.669
Being disciplined means

40:54.713 --> 40:57.150
the system is working.

40:57.193 --> 40:59.108
Ah.
[chuckles]

40:59.152 --> 41:00.283
I admire your outlook

41:00.327 --> 41:02.285
in the face
of demotion.

41:02.329 --> 41:03.939
How about I buy you lunch?

41:03.983 --> 41:05.027
That's a great idea.

41:05.071 --> 41:06.594
Convictions always
make me hungry.

41:06.638 --> 41:08.857
I just have to grab my clock.

41:08.901 --> 41:10.729
Clock?

41:10.772 --> 41:12.644
Hey, did you know
that, uh, casinos

41:12.687 --> 41:14.428
don't have clocks on the floor?

41:14.472 --> 41:15.777
Yes, so the customers

41:15.821 --> 41:18.084
will lose track of time
and keep gambling.

41:18.127 --> 41:20.347
Exactly. And you know,

41:20.390 --> 41:22.088
the longer
jurors deliberate,

41:22.131 --> 41:23.959
the greater the chance
they'll choose to convict?

41:24.003 --> 41:26.135
You removed the
clock so the jurors

41:26.179 --> 41:28.311
wouldn't realize how long
they've been deliberating

41:28.355 --> 41:30.400
in order to persuade them

41:30.444 --> 41:31.793
to convict?Yes.

41:31.837 --> 41:33.491
Before the jury
came in this morning.

41:33.534 --> 41:35.362
That's very unorthodox.

41:35.405 --> 41:37.712
Most good ideas are.[laughs]

41:37.756 --> 41:40.323
And so the student
became the master.

41:40.367 --> 41:42.412
Learning from the best.

41:42.456 --> 41:44.023
