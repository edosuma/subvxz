WEBVTT

00:20.920 --> 00:23.823
Y'all niggas ain't no shit!
MKT, bitch!

00:23.890 --> 00:25.892
[gun shots]

00:26.026 --> 00:28.395
-Stay with us!
-Come on!

00:28.628 --> 00:29.829
Come on, please!

00:33.900 --> 00:35.668
The shooter is still at large.

00:39.305 --> 00:41.841
My motherfuckin' brother 
is shot in the face.

00:51.818 --> 00:52.919
[door knocking]

00:54.421 --> 00:55.655
[gun reloading]

00:55.722 --> 00:57.090
[sirens ringing]

01:01.461 --> 01:05.465
This shit killing and robbing
motherfuckers is an addiction.

01:36.129 --> 01:37.097
[clears throat]

01:37.163 --> 01:40.967
These are each individual kilograms
of cocaine.

01:41.034 --> 01:44.037
This would run you 
20 to $25,000 on the street.

01:44.137 --> 01:47.273
But drug dealers can almost 
quadruple the value

01:47.340 --> 01:48.441
to...

01:48.508 --> 01:51.711
upwards of $100,000,
when they make it crack cocaine.

01:52.445 --> 01:55.415
So you're upwards of a million dollars
in that cardboard box.

01:56.850 --> 01:59.052
That is what is driving the violence.

01:59.452 --> 02:02.322
Memorial Day would be 
an increase in sales.

02:02.388 --> 02:03.857
That presents an opportunity

02:03.923 --> 02:08.194
for rival drug dealers 
to target their competitors.

02:11.698 --> 02:15.268
There's probably close to 600 handguns
in this room here.

02:15.835 --> 02:17.937
For every gun we get off the street,

02:18.004 --> 02:20.673
there's 100 more
that we're still looking for.

02:20.740 --> 02:22.208
This represents

02:22.275 --> 02:25.178
the violence that we're confronting
on a daily basis.

02:25.245 --> 02:27.247
And it represents the drug game

02:27.313 --> 02:30.250
because firearms and narcotics
are one in the same.

02:31.684 --> 02:33.119
It does scare me that

02:33.186 --> 02:35.455
the bad guys can get their hands 
on this,

02:35.522 --> 02:38.691
but to work the street 
and to move around the area

02:38.758 --> 02:40.994
with this in the back your mind,
is counterproductive.

02:42.295 --> 02:44.931
Somebody has to be in the middle. 
We're tasked with that .

02:44.998 --> 02:49.135
We took that oath. We understand what 
we're getting ourselves into every day.

02:50.069 --> 02:51.804
Is it dangerous? Absolutely.

02:51.871 --> 02:54.507
I leave the house every day 
knowing I may not come home.

02:55.208 --> 02:57.210
But the drug game doesn't take a holiday

02:57.277 --> 02:58.912
and we're doing everything we can

02:58.978 --> 03:00.480
to stay ahead of it.

03:19.399 --> 03:22.602
[Narrator]  There's one area of Chicago 
that's notorious for poverty,

03:23.102 --> 03:24.404
drugs and violence.

03:25.471 --> 03:27.941
Where even the cops fear to tread.

03:29.542 --> 03:31.578
It's known as the Westside.

03:41.554 --> 03:45.558
The dealers here are already preparing
for the Memorial Day rush.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.001
[Slim] That's good cocaine.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.003
You see how it’s shiny, like fish scales.

03:57.870 --> 04:00.139
When I see that,
that makes me happy.

04:00.974 --> 04:03.009
[Narrator]  Slim runs a local drug gang .

04:03.076 --> 04:05.778
I'm a boss. My team is full of CEOs.

04:05.845 --> 04:07.247
I answer to no one.

04:07.313 --> 04:09.582
I'm not kicking it with the middle man
or the low man,

04:10.083 --> 04:12.418
I’m kicking it with niggers 
that’s doing this shit.

04:14.954 --> 04:16.656
I'm mixing it with baking soda,

04:16.723 --> 04:20.660
because it creates a chemical reaction
and that's why it turns into crack.

04:27.200 --> 04:30.703
I got this little pot right here, 
I'm not doing it no big Pyrex.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.438
Put in a little water.

04:35.708 --> 04:37.176
Then I'm gonna get it hot.

04:38.411 --> 04:40.079
And we're gonna melt it down.

04:40.146 --> 04:42.181
I want all the cocaine rocks

04:42.649 --> 04:46.252
to buzz down and it slowly mixes in 
with the baking soda.

04:53.559 --> 04:55.628
The coldness of this popsicle

04:55.695 --> 04:58.965
is going to make this easy for me
to whip, and we just going to stir

04:59.032 --> 05:00.566
until it cools down.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.001
See how it's changing?

05:02.368 --> 05:03.836
They call that "lock up".

05:04.637 --> 05:05.938
I'm gonna put this out.

05:06.005 --> 05:08.508
It's going to be the best crack 
in Chicago.

05:11.277 --> 05:12.979
That'll be $10 right there.

05:13.046 --> 05:15.481
No doubt about it.
You're gonna get high off that.

05:15.548 --> 05:16.382
Okay?

05:16.616 --> 05:19.085
When they hit that shit, man, 
it's euphoria.

05:19.152 --> 05:22.989
The cleaner it is, the better it is,
they come right back.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.857
By the end of the night,

05:24.924 --> 05:27.827
depending on how much money they got 
and how thirsty they are,

05:27.894 --> 05:29.762
this can give me $1,000.

05:29.829 --> 05:32.031
We’re damn near more
expensive than gold right now.

05:32.098 --> 05:34.100
This is better than US currency!

05:36.002 --> 05:37.303
[Narrator]  Once the crack is cooked up,

05:38.037 --> 05:39.939
the street dealers take over.

05:49.515 --> 05:51.651
[sirens ringing]

06:02.428 --> 06:03.329
[Low] This is like...

06:03.396 --> 06:06.099
9 grams right here. Costs like 500.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.870
We're going to try to make 
8 to 900 off of it.

06:10.937 --> 06:13.406
[Narrator]  JD and Low have just picked up 
more product.

06:13.473 --> 06:14.974
I wouldn’t say I was born into this,

06:15.041 --> 06:17.210
it just happened from
the environment you live in.

06:17.844 --> 06:20.446
We ain't grew up in Beverly Hills.
That's what we do.

06:20.513 --> 06:23.216
You adapt to what's around you every day.

06:23.716 --> 06:25.585
That's my nephew right here.

06:25.651 --> 06:28.521
He’s putting together
a little 50 right here.

06:28.588 --> 06:31.657
Everybody trying to get money 
and opportunity, I’m sure you know.

06:31.724 --> 06:34.293
I gotta bring food to the table
somewhere, man.

06:34.360 --> 06:37.330
You feel me? 
That’s the way I gotta get it out here.

06:38.431 --> 06:40.533
I’m trying to double up for Memorial Day,

06:40.600 --> 06:42.969
so I’ll get the money 
to get out the neighborhood

06:43.035 --> 06:45.872
and create better jobs, 
you know, legitimate jobs.

06:47.039 --> 06:48.741
[Narrator]
Both want to make enough money over

06:48.808 --> 06:50.810
Memorial weekend to get out of the game.

06:51.844 --> 06:54.981
So we definitely need
to make like 8 to 9 G.

06:55.281 --> 06:56.249
You know what I mean?

06:56.315 --> 06:58.918
Then after that, we gonna be gone.

06:58.985 --> 07:02.255
My homie just got killed a few days ago, 
we gotta bury him Saturday.

07:02.321 --> 07:06.125
It’s a death 2, 3 times 
a month now, you know what I mean?

07:06.192 --> 07:10.062
It’s painful, that you're not even over 
the first death and another one happens,

07:10.129 --> 07:11.130
and it’s consistent.

07:11.197 --> 07:13.499
I feel horrible 
when I go to the funerals, man.

07:13.566 --> 07:17.403
People up I see in the caskets,
some people I’ve been with all my life.

07:17.470 --> 07:20.440
It’ll take a toll on you, man. 
But we gotta let it go,

07:20.506 --> 07:23.576
but man, it’s hard 
to let that hurt go sometimes.

07:38.624 --> 07:41.828
[Low]  It’s terrible outside, 
everybody’s hurting everybody.

07:41.894 --> 07:45.498
We live in it, every morning, 
it’s just a swamp, it’s a zoo.

07:45.565 --> 07:47.800
Every day you come outside 
and you worry about,

07:47.867 --> 07:49.802
is this your last day coming home?

07:49.869 --> 07:52.805
But for the time being, I’m hustling.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.057
I appreciate you man.

08:11.657 --> 08:13.059
[indistinctive chatter]

08:14.293 --> 08:18.264
[man] We got 14 grams, man.
That shit's hitting hard.

08:24.604 --> 08:29.141
CI yesterday gave us information, 
supposedly they deal in this alley here.

08:29.609 --> 08:32.645
The main thing is, he did say 
the one guy did have a gun.

08:39.886 --> 08:43.823
[Narrator]  Joe and his team are preparing 
to bust two crack dealers.

08:44.023 --> 08:47.026
When we decide to move,
it's going to be all timing.

08:47.460 --> 08:49.695
They do run, 
what’s huge is for containment.

08:49.762 --> 08:51.931
It’s a box operation,
you know how this goes.

08:51.998 --> 08:54.200
We don’t want 
a friendly fire scenario, okay?

08:54.267 --> 08:56.369
So if it is a flush,
call it on the air.

08:56.435 --> 08:59.572
They’re running west, or south.
Be deliberate with your directions,

08:59.639 --> 09:02.108
where they’re running.
Call out those descriptions.

09:02.174 --> 09:04.410
If you see a firearm 
like a couple of weeks ago,

09:04.477 --> 09:06.279
weapon displayed, 
box in the property.

09:06.345 --> 09:07.513
-You guys good?
-Yeah.

09:08.114 --> 09:09.015
Let's saddle up.

09:13.019 --> 09:15.888
[Joseph] This is the Westside of Chicago,
Austin Harrison District.

09:15.988 --> 09:18.524
Heavy gang activity, heavy drug activity.

09:18.991 --> 09:22.461
A lot of open air drug markets,
every walk of life.

09:24.230 --> 09:27.667
Our informant has made 
several buys at this location.

09:32.104 --> 09:33.739
[Marissa]
The individual selling narcotics

09:33.806 --> 09:34.807
may be gang-related.

09:34.874 --> 09:36.008
If we apprehend the subject,

09:36.075 --> 09:38.477
we talk to them 
and see who the next big fish is.

09:38.945 --> 09:43.215
Who’s a little bit higher than him.
And who’s a little bit higher than them.

09:43.416 --> 09:47.320
Try to get to where the true problem is, 
where they're getting their drugs.

09:48.054 --> 09:49.689
We got people here,

09:49.755 --> 09:53.225
who don’t have good jobs, 
don’t have jobs at all, don't work.

09:53.326 --> 09:58.130
And they could come out here 
and make 500, $1,000 a day or more.

09:58.631 --> 10:00.600
So they choose the easy route.

10:01.701 --> 10:04.704
[Marissa] There’s about one, two, three… 
Three gentlemen.

10:05.071 --> 10:06.973
They are selling narcotics.

10:07.740 --> 10:09.208
[on radio] Yeah, we'll move in.

10:10.376 --> 10:12.144
He's going westbound.

10:13.646 --> 10:16.082
Westbound, westbound!
Go, go, go!

10:21.320 --> 10:23.422
One went this way, one, that way, 
which one?

10:23.489 --> 10:25.291
Okay.  We’ll do--

10:25.358 --> 10:26.492
Stand by, stand by.

10:26.559 --> 10:29.128
Oh no, go.  Wait.

10:30.062 --> 10:31.430
Where they go?

10:31.497 --> 10:33.199
-See them?
-No.

10:33.666 --> 10:35.668
Here! They're down there!

10:37.770 --> 10:39.171
They ran that way.

10:39.872 --> 10:42.074
[on radio] They're inside.

10:50.983 --> 10:53.352
Here, scoot down. You got it?

11:01.727 --> 11:03.729
[officer] Right there. Going in.

11:05.131 --> 11:08.100
Put your hands behind your back.
Put your hands behind your back!

11:09.935 --> 11:11.070
Let's see.

11:11.137 --> 11:14.407
I smell a little marijuana on you, 
so if you’ve got it,

11:14.473 --> 11:17.076
-I suggest you give it to me.
-I ain't doin' no hustling.

11:17.176 --> 11:19.045
I promise to God. I rumble by, bro…

11:19.111 --> 11:21.113
I ain’t doing no hustling, bro.

11:21.647 --> 11:23.616
Guys, guys. Enough.

11:24.216 --> 11:25.384
Be quiet right now.

11:26.285 --> 11:29.689
You’re on video tape,
be quiet, stop talking.

11:29.755 --> 11:31.190
Not gonna tell you again.

11:31.490 --> 11:33.426
[Joseph]  One’s gonna go to jail 
for an active warrant.

11:33.492 --> 11:36.529
He has an arrest warrant in another county
for obstructing a peace officer.

11:36.595 --> 11:38.164
Ain’t the first time 
he ran from the police.

11:38.230 --> 11:39.398
Relax, dude.

11:39.932 --> 11:42.001
Right now we’re just doing
a canvas looking for...

11:42.068 --> 11:44.904
if they threw a firearm, 
we don’t want no kids picking up the gun.

12:04.990 --> 12:06.792
Today, we made 250.

12:06.859 --> 12:10.429
If I could just make $500 today, 
I’d be happy.

12:11.997 --> 12:13.599
You just gotta be careful.

12:13.666 --> 12:15.868
We take a risk coming outside every day.

12:15.935 --> 12:18.471
Being out on these streets 
is very dangerous, man.

12:18.938 --> 12:22.608
Every day you gotta watch out 
for the rival gangs trying to shoot.

12:22.675 --> 12:26.445
They catch your ass out that late,
they gonna fire your ass up.

12:33.719 --> 12:36.956
When you got crack, we’re the ones 
that you need to be worried about.

12:37.022 --> 12:39.225
GDs, that’s us, man.
Know what I’m saying?

12:39.291 --> 12:41.694
Gangster Disciples. Most hated.

12:43.462 --> 12:45.264
Every jail, every block, 
everybody scared of us.

12:45.331 --> 12:48.400
[Narrator]  The Gangster Disciples are 
the biggest street gang in Chicago.

12:49.135 --> 12:51.670
With their original leaders 
dead or in prison,

12:52.138 --> 12:55.641
the gang is fragmented 
into small violent cliques.

12:58.043 --> 13:00.746
We’re a stick up crew, we don’t 
give a fuck about selling drugs,

13:00.813 --> 13:03.983
we’re gonna let a niggas sell his drugs 
and rob him when he done.

13:04.049 --> 13:06.252
And if we gotta kill to get it, 
that’s what’s gonna happen.

13:07.052 --> 13:09.822
This is not a movie. 
You can’t shoot a gun like this.

13:10.222 --> 13:13.359
Just like when you aim,
it line up all the way to your shoulder,

13:13.425 --> 13:16.061
you can’t miss, you got you a clean shot.

13:16.729 --> 13:19.265
When I shoot, I’m in a pure action mode.

13:19.331 --> 13:21.100
I’m in pure kill mode.

13:21.167 --> 13:25.304
I ain’t got no feelings, no remorse 
for none who get hit, none of that shit.

13:26.238 --> 13:28.874
[Narrator]  They’ve been gathering intel 
on local dealers.

13:29.441 --> 13:31.644
You gotta know how to stalk your prey.

13:31.710 --> 13:34.580
You can’t just run up
on somebody in broad daylight

13:34.647 --> 13:36.682
and kill ‘em unless you want 100 years.

13:36.749 --> 13:38.584
You gotta find out how he move,

13:38.651 --> 13:40.286
how much shit he got,

13:40.352 --> 13:41.420
where he be at.

13:41.520 --> 13:44.390
You got one of these,
you can do whatever you want.

13:44.456 --> 13:45.958
Get whatever you want.

13:46.125 --> 13:47.359
Whatever you desire.

13:49.328 --> 13:51.397
[Narrator]
Attracted by the lure of the streets,

13:51.463 --> 13:53.866
gangbangers on the Westside start young.

13:54.834 --> 13:58.204
I’ve been in the streets 
since I was about 11. I was in Juvenile

13:58.304 --> 14:00.773
when I was in sixth grade. Armed robbery.

14:01.207 --> 14:03.409
I was brought up with good parents,

14:03.475 --> 14:05.511
I ain’t gonna never lie
and say I wasn’t.

14:05.578 --> 14:08.647
But when I got to these streets 
and I got that fast money,

14:08.714 --> 14:10.449
the love of that fast money,

14:10.516 --> 14:12.518
it draws you to this.

14:12.618 --> 14:16.121
People wanna have fancy cars 
and a lot of bitches and drugs

14:16.188 --> 14:19.391
and money and flash guns. It’s adrenaline.

14:19.992 --> 14:24.096
This street shit killing motherfuckers and
robbing motherfuckers is an addiction.

14:28.701 --> 14:31.503
[on radio]  I'm going to get over there.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.973
Yeah, we're available. Heading over there.

14:34.039 --> 14:36.041
Going on the outside.

14:36.408 --> 14:40.012
-Get over there.
-Ten-four.

14:40.212 --> 14:41.280
Shootings,

14:41.547 --> 14:43.949
...crashes, fires.
I cover everything.

14:45.684 --> 14:47.887
[Narrator]
Pauley Lapointe is cruising the Westside

14:48.821 --> 14:51.457
hoping to catch a story 
he can sell to local news.

14:52.658 --> 14:55.995
I've got these different radios going
providing different information,

14:56.061 --> 14:58.063
potential leads on a story.

14:58.130 --> 15:00.666
I just have to wrangle it all in 
and make it work.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.835
Like orchestrating a symphony.

15:03.535 --> 15:05.037
[transmission sounds]

15:09.808 --> 15:12.845
I’ve been born and raised 
in the Chicago area my whole life.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.414
I love the city. From a news perspective,

15:15.481 --> 15:17.816
as a news person,
since I’ve been a child,

15:18.183 --> 15:20.719
I’ve always wanted to be a part of news,

15:20.786 --> 15:23.122
to tell the story of my community.

15:23.188 --> 15:25.024
Whatever the story is.

15:25.124 --> 15:28.193
I believe that
there’s a story to every shooting.

15:28.694 --> 15:29.595
Some people will...

15:30.262 --> 15:33.899
try to say, it’s no big deal, 
it’s just a gang banger.

15:35.167 --> 15:36.168
And it’s not true.

15:36.235 --> 15:38.704
It’s a real human being, it’s a real life.

15:44.510 --> 15:49.081
This part of the Westside, drugs are
a multi-billion dollar business.

15:49.148 --> 15:53.719
[on radio] You better a car over there.
Any available in the area.

15:53.819 --> 15:55.054
[Pauley] Another person shot.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.555
[on radio]  A person shot.

15:57.256 --> 15:59.058
[Narrator]  He intercepts his first call.

15:59.158 --> 16:00.759
[Pauley]
This is going to be a gang-related.

16:01.327 --> 16:03.662
[Narrator]  And it's right in the heart 
of the Westside.

16:03.729 --> 16:06.231
[Pauley]  You have to be hyper aware 
when you’re at the scene,

16:06.298 --> 16:08.867
there’s still bad guys running around 
with guns, who wanna shoot people.

16:08.934 --> 16:12.538
They don’t care about shooting you, me
and the cops and everybody in-between.

16:16.175 --> 16:20.212
And for your Saturday night, you have 
crime scene tape right next to a school .

16:21.080 --> 16:23.782
That's how Chicago sets itself apart.

16:25.250 --> 16:28.854
Doesn’t matter where it is, or who it is,
it just happens.

16:30.356 --> 16:33.058
They emptied the entire gun out 
right over here.

16:33.158 --> 16:34.994
So you can see all the markers.

16:36.195 --> 16:38.397
See all those? Those are all markers.

16:38.464 --> 16:41.934
Those are all markers
for shell casings, spread from...

16:43.268 --> 16:47.206
30 feet, going on 30, 40 feet.
So it’s not just one little spot,

16:47.272 --> 16:49.608
these bullets went across this whole area,

16:49.675 --> 16:52.144
so the gunman came here 
and started to pop, pop, pop.

16:53.078 --> 16:56.782
Four houses that potentially people could 
have been shot inside the home

16:56.849 --> 16:59.018
with a bullet flying into the house

16:59.084 --> 17:03.756
or hitting someone. Two people were shot.
They were over here on the front lawn.

17:03.856 --> 17:07.326
You can see how quickly 
this situation could change

17:08.160 --> 17:11.230
for the people that are just trying 
to live their life here.

17:16.902 --> 17:21.240
They pulled over 8,000 weapons 
off the streets of Chicago last year.

17:21.306 --> 17:24.510
They've already confiscated 
thousands of guns again this year.

17:24.576 --> 17:27.980
But the bad guys seem
to find a way to always get a gun

17:28.047 --> 17:29.848
in the city of Chicago.

17:45.264 --> 17:47.332
[G Money]
A lot of fucking murders on the street.

17:47.399 --> 17:49.635
That’s why dealers is buying guns.

17:54.873 --> 17:58.077
I really don’t deal
with too many type of cheap guns,

17:58.143 --> 18:00.379
'cause you know, 
people really don’t want ‘em.

18:00.446 --> 18:03.315
Some people talking about how they need 
something to protect their self.

18:03.415 --> 18:05.784
They might get a little nine or something.

18:05.851 --> 18:09.121
This is a little 13 shot nine. 
This could take a 30 round clip,

18:10.089 --> 18:12.825
and they sell for probably like 150.

18:15.727 --> 18:17.596
And this one,
this is a beautiful gun.

18:18.330 --> 18:22.201
This is a Colt .45. 
This going for $1,000 easy.

18:23.402 --> 18:24.369
Real easy.

18:24.436 --> 18:27.439
This is one of the best three guns, 
this is a Glock 19.

18:27.539 --> 18:30.509
This a custom top on it right here, 
it’s a sharp metal.

18:30.609 --> 18:31.577
It's nice.

18:32.644 --> 18:34.913
This going for probably like $1,000.

18:34.980 --> 18:38.584
This is a Mac 90, fully auto.

18:38.650 --> 18:40.953
It’s like a new version of a Uzi gun.

18:41.019 --> 18:44.223
This the unexpected. You come in a house 
and take everybody out,

18:44.289 --> 18:45.724
nobody ain’t gonna hear shit.

18:45.824 --> 18:48.127
This one… I pay 1700 for this one.

18:48.594 --> 18:51.363
It’s like a pet. 
You fall in love with your pet.

18:53.332 --> 18:54.433
[gun loading]

18:55.467 --> 18:58.170
There’s a young boy
from Indiana, man,

18:58.637 --> 18:59.905
he keep me right,

19:00.339 --> 19:02.908
all the latest and hottest shit.

19:03.909 --> 19:06.245
[Narrator]
G Money sources his guns from Indiana

19:06.311 --> 19:08.747
because the gun laws there 
are less strict.

19:10.215 --> 19:12.985
He smuggles them across state lines 
into Illinois,

19:13.085 --> 19:14.653
eventually to Chicago

19:14.720 --> 19:17.489
where he can double or even triple
his investment.

19:17.556 --> 19:19.324
People want real guns 
that do real damage.

19:19.791 --> 19:21.393
This the AK right here.

19:21.660 --> 19:25.764
This an AK-47 right here. 
This go for about 1500.

19:25.898 --> 19:28.267
They really don’t jam.  It keep going.

19:28.667 --> 19:32.504
I got some more shit for you. 
I just thought about it.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.840
I got something that you like.

19:37.442 --> 19:39.111
This right here,

19:40.946 --> 19:42.047
This...

19:42.214 --> 19:45.117
This right here, 
this is the Tommy gun.

19:45.551 --> 19:48.120
These have been around Chicago for years.

19:53.759 --> 19:56.962
That’s the gun they used to hang off 
the side of old ass cars with.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.230
It’s beautiful.

19:58.363 --> 20:02.201
This one right here going for probably 
about like 2500 on the street.

20:02.267 --> 20:04.136
You ain’t gonna find too many of these.

20:04.236 --> 20:06.572
[Narrator]
G Money's stash of guns could net him

20:06.638 --> 20:08.907
over $10,000 on the black market.

20:09.675 --> 20:12.411
This going for about like 2500.

20:12.477 --> 20:16.348
This the best fucking handgun you can get
on the streets right now.

20:16.448 --> 20:17.749
Fucking F&N.

20:17.816 --> 20:19.851
This is the gun of all guns.

20:19.952 --> 20:22.487
Outshoot all them fuckers with this.

20:22.554 --> 20:25.924
Look at shells in there, 
these hollow tips, wood tips.

20:25.991 --> 20:27.593
Fucking cop killers.

20:30.596 --> 20:32.598
[sirens ringing]

20:34.600 --> 20:36.201
[transmission sounds]

20:45.544 --> 20:46.778
[Joseph]
Given the nature

20:46.845 --> 20:48.347
and the environment that we're working in,

20:48.413 --> 20:49.781
we carry guns to protect ourselves,

20:49.848 --> 20:52.484
the gang members carry guns 
to protect themselves,

20:52.551 --> 20:54.253
themselves and their product.

20:55.420 --> 20:58.757
[Narrator]  Joe Scofield and his unit 
are patrolling Cicero Avenue

20:58.824 --> 21:00.125
on the city’s Westside.

21:02.494 --> 21:04.263
With Memorial Day approaching,

21:04.329 --> 21:07.799
they’re on high alert
for cars carrying firearms.

21:08.066 --> 21:11.270
[Joseph] We’re trying to put as many
bad guys away as possible

21:11.336 --> 21:13.805
and get as many guns
off the street as we can.

21:13.872 --> 21:16.541
We kind of have a running saying 
in the unit:

21:16.608 --> 21:19.244
"Each gun recovered is a life saved."

21:22.114 --> 21:23.448
[indistinctive chatter on radio]

21:23.515 --> 21:25.617
All right, so he’s got 
a cracked windshield.

21:25.684 --> 21:27.419
He crossed two lanes, he’s seen us,

21:27.486 --> 21:31.256
we call that the guilty right, 
they wanna get out of our view

21:31.323 --> 21:32.758
as soon as possible.

21:32.824 --> 21:34.726
We’re gonna stop this car.

21:35.227 --> 21:36.628
He might run.

21:42.567 --> 21:45.304
What’s up, buddy, how you doing?
Everything good tonight?

21:45.370 --> 21:47.406
You have a driver’s license
and insurance?

21:54.212 --> 21:55.881
Joe smells marijuana.

21:57.082 --> 21:59.785
All right, step out, 
I’ll explain in just a minute, okay?

21:59.851 --> 22:01.853
We’ll talk.  Cannabis.

22:02.087 --> 22:04.456
You either just got done smoking
or you’re still holding it.

22:04.523 --> 22:05.691
Ain't nobody got hurt,

22:05.791 --> 22:07.793
no reason to make this 
worse than it’s gotta be.

22:07.859 --> 22:09.594
You guys smoking earlier today?

22:09.661 --> 22:12.164
-I don't smoke. 
-How about your buddy?

22:12.230 --> 22:13.432
I don't know, man.

22:14.099 --> 22:15.767
So he got a bag of weed on him?

22:15.834 --> 22:19.338
All right. That’s why you’re out the car.
Now we’re on the same page, right?

22:19.438 --> 22:21.273
[Narrator]
Routine traffic stops allow the police

22:21.340 --> 22:23.542
to check for more serious offenses.

22:24.309 --> 22:28.013
We approach every vehicle as if 
there’s a firearm inside   the vehicle.

22:28.613 --> 22:32.017
We’ll find firearms
in the speaker compartment here.

22:32.084 --> 22:34.619
This is loose.  There’s no other reason 
for that to be loose.

22:37.889 --> 22:40.325

Marissa runs the passenger's ID

22:40.959 --> 22:42.894

23:00.946 --> 23:03.782
[Narrator]
Joe's unit is working over a wide area.

23:07.786 --> 23:09.621
-[officer] How many people in this car?
-[all] Four.

23:09.688 --> 23:11.857
Can you come talk to me out here?

23:13.392 --> 23:16.027
Keep your hands up.

23:19.831 --> 23:22.401
Hey, cuff this guy. Turn around.

23:22.467 --> 23:24.770
[Narrator]  They find an illegal firearm.

23:24.903 --> 23:29.541
Turn around, I’m gonna cuff you real fast.
I’m gonna put two cuffs on you.

23:30.175 --> 23:31.943
You have the right to remain silent.

23:32.010 --> 23:34.613
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

23:34.713 --> 23:37.349
You have a right to have an attorney 
present while you’re being questioned.

23:37.416 --> 23:38.750
If you cannot afford an attorney,

23:38.817 --> 23:41.386
one will be appointed to you 
before any questioning is conducted.

23:41.486 --> 23:44.289
Do you understand these rights?
You've been Mirandized.

23:44.389 --> 23:45.857
Yes, sir.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.326
[Narrator]
That's one gun that won't be around

23:48.393 --> 23:49.394
for the holiday weekend.

24:02.607 --> 24:04.609
[sirens ringing]

24:09.448 --> 24:12.117
We gotta do something
about the guns coming in.

24:12.184 --> 24:16.054
I have no clue how they’re getting
these guns in that easy.

24:17.122 --> 24:20.759
[Narrator]  Big Will is on his way
to another shooting on the Westside.

24:20.826 --> 24:24.162
[Big Will]
They call it "Chiraq" because we’ve had

24:24.229 --> 24:28.099
more people murdered 
than people killed in Iraq war.

24:28.166 --> 24:30.202
That’s why they call it "Chiraq".

24:30.635 --> 24:33.905
And that’s not a label 
we should be proud of.

24:34.239 --> 24:38.176
I mean I’m not…  I don’t know… 
I’m not proud of it, you know.

24:38.310 --> 24:41.880
Being the murder capital of the world, 
I mean that’s crazy.

24:43.682 --> 24:47.118
But we gotta stop glorifying that stuff, 
you know, the lifestyle.

24:47.319 --> 24:51.089
Gang banging, selling drugs, 
that’s not a great lifestyle.

24:51.623 --> 24:55.026
And a lot of these kids, they don’t care.

24:55.126 --> 24:57.963
That’s all they know.
They don’t know nothing else.

24:58.930 --> 24:59.931
[siren ringing]

25:04.135 --> 25:08.073
18 year old got shot
and killed today in the backyard.

25:09.441 --> 25:10.475
It’s sad, man.

25:10.575 --> 25:12.477
I see something like this,

25:12.577 --> 25:14.346
it's happening too much.

25:14.779 --> 25:17.616
Fighting over the drugs, over the money

25:17.682 --> 25:21.987
or they’re so high on the drugs, 
they become violent.

25:23.522 --> 25:24.789
-It's my nephew.
-[woman] He's dead.

25:24.856 --> 25:27.459
And I talked to him a week ago.

25:28.293 --> 25:30.095
I told him, I called him a bum,

25:30.161 --> 25:32.030
that’s a nickname
between him and us

25:32.130 --> 25:33.632
and I said: 
“Baby, you need to call me.

25:33.698 --> 25:35.767
I need to hear from you."

25:35.834 --> 25:37.402
You want to make sure they’re okay.

25:37.469 --> 25:40.372
-I promise you, I get it, I’m a mom.
-Are you?

25:40.472 --> 25:44.609
I am a mom.  And I have a 19 year old. 
So I feel your pain.

25:44.676 --> 25:49.214
I would never expect to say,
I’m gonna lose one of my babies.

25:50.115 --> 25:52.517
Us standing right here now, 
it’s very dangerous.

25:52.617 --> 25:56.288
The other gang could come in,
shoot the block up. They don't care

25:56.688 --> 25:59.858
who’s on the block, 
kids, women, they don’t care no more.

25:59.958 --> 26:01.960
[sirens ringing]

26:05.463 --> 26:06.765
Unfortunately,

26:06.831 --> 26:09.601
in the area that we’re in, with 
the Memorial season coming,

26:09.668 --> 26:12.304
this is an every day occurrence.

26:23.782 --> 26:27.452
[Narrator]  JD and Low have taken
delivery of another 8 ball of crack

26:27.719 --> 26:29.921
ready for the Memorial Day rush.

26:32.190 --> 26:34.292
[Law] We don’t wanna get 
in the middle of the wars,

26:34.392 --> 26:38.697
but you can’t let that stop you on doing 
what you’re doing to get your money.

26:38.763 --> 26:40.899
You gotta keep striving 
and pushing for what you need

26:40.966 --> 26:44.502
and what you gotta do out here 
to feed yourself and your family, man.

26:45.503 --> 26:48.540
That’s what it is, but we’ve gotta 
keep watching all the time,

26:48.607 --> 26:51.876
24/7 'cause people break
in the house and home invade it.

26:51.943 --> 26:53.545
So we gotta be ready.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.814
You’ll never know
when they’re gonna come.

27:04.322 --> 27:06.224
[Narrator]
Across the Westside, a hush falls

27:06.291 --> 27:08.560
in anticipation of the holiday weekend.

27:27.979 --> 27:31.016
Crack around here,
where we’re from, that’s for sure   money.

27:31.616 --> 27:34.019
I know it’s gonna sell every day.

27:34.653 --> 27:38.390
I had a job before
and I felt like I was getting cheated.

27:38.490 --> 27:39.557
I started selling crack

27:39.624 --> 27:43.561
'cause I made that paycheck they were
giving me on one phone call sometimes.

27:44.062 --> 27:46.431
This is about $400 worth

27:46.498 --> 27:49.100
and I spent about 120 on it.

27:49.167 --> 27:51.536
So that’s like a 300
something dollar profit.

27:54.572 --> 27:58.309
[Narrator]  Connor and AJ are pitching
a new product to partygoers.

27:58.543 --> 27:59.811
Molly.

28:00.278 --> 28:03.615
On Memorial Day weekend, 
when the family time over with,

28:03.682 --> 28:05.784
it’s time to shake that ass,
go to the clubs,

28:05.850 --> 28:08.019
people gonna need them pills.

28:08.286 --> 28:10.789
My Molly over the weekend, it sells out.

28:10.855 --> 28:13.692
I get it in quantity and then I break it 
down and put it into capsules.

28:15.527 --> 28:16.695
It give you a good high.

28:16.795 --> 28:20.298
You ready to turn up, to party, 
you know, ready to have fun.

28:20.498 --> 28:21.733
My left...

28:22.000 --> 28:23.501
this would be $10.

28:23.968 --> 28:27.539
And this one on my right will be 15 bucks.

28:27.972 --> 28:30.075
I get it for 200 and I can make about...

28:30.141 --> 28:33.712
650, 680 off of it,
something like that.

28:34.345 --> 28:37.649
[Narrator]  The profits are high,
but so are the risks.

28:38.717 --> 28:42.153
Yeah, we Gangster Disciples,
you know what I'm saying?

28:42.320 --> 28:46.758
But as far as unity with the gangs,
it don’t exist like that.

28:46.825 --> 28:50.361
Other gangs want to fuck me up, 
jump on me, pop me, shoot me, whatever.

28:50.428 --> 28:53.231
But, if you from here, you’re not scared

28:53.298 --> 28:56.301
because you’d have been through it
so much it’s like...

28:56.367 --> 28:59.003
This shit’s not scary, 
you know what’s going on, so...

28:59.070 --> 29:00.805
No, it ain’t scary, but...

29:00.905 --> 29:03.208
as far as the police 
breaking in here,

29:03.274 --> 29:06.211
as far as niggas running in here, 
that’s what we got guns for.

29:06.277 --> 29:09.514
You know what I’m saying, niggas?
How we got this shit set up,

29:09.581 --> 29:12.951
we’ll be able to know if a motherfucker 
coming in this bitch anyway, you know?

29:14.052 --> 29:15.920
[Narrator]
With rival gangs targeting them,

29:15.987 --> 29:18.323
the Disciples are not taking any chances.

29:19.891 --> 29:21.893
The feeling of having
a gun is like power.

29:21.960 --> 29:24.329
Nobody can fuck with you, 
nobody can say shit to you.

29:24.462 --> 29:27.832
Nobody can disrespect you, 
you know? You have control.

29:29.167 --> 29:31.736
This is actually a 12 gauge rifle.

29:32.303 --> 29:35.640
This for close range shit. 
Buck shots come out this bitch so…

29:35.707 --> 29:37.742
So if I shoot you and there’s a couple 
of people around you,

29:37.809 --> 29:40.645
might hit two, three people 
with one bullet. Know what I'm saying?

29:40.712 --> 29:44.282
It got a hard kick in. You gotta be
prepared when you shoot it.

29:44.349 --> 29:46.484
Got to be real prepared
'cause it’s gonna blow real hard.

29:47.252 --> 29:50.288
Another thing about the gun is,
you don’t wanna touch the shells.

29:50.388 --> 29:53.124
When you enter the clip, the shell cases 
are gonna be left at the crime scene,

29:53.224 --> 29:55.326
so when the police do
come and pick ‘em up,

29:55.460 --> 29:57.462
you don’t want your fingerprints 
on the shells.

30:05.069 --> 30:09.140
[Connor] At night time is harder
to make out the cars that’s coming.

30:09.274 --> 30:13.545
You’ve gotta have your eyes open and 
they can come out a dark alley shooting.

30:13.611 --> 30:15.280
They move with the shadows.

30:15.780 --> 30:17.315
[AJ] You gotta be on point

30:17.382 --> 30:20.485
or else you could get got 
or you could be dead.

30:20.552 --> 30:23.254
To me making it to 25
is a blessing.

30:23.321 --> 30:26.324
A lot of my friends
ain’t get to see 25.

30:28.259 --> 30:30.261
[sirens ringing]

30:38.403 --> 30:41.206
[ Narrator]  a few blocks away,
there’s been another shooting.

30:41.272 --> 30:44.909
[officer] Do not come in the crime scene.
Do you understand me?

30:45.510 --> 30:48.246
They emptied the entire gun out, 
right over here.

30:49.113 --> 30:51.349
Inside or in the house.

30:53.284 --> 30:54.953
What's the fucking problem?

30:55.320 --> 30:57.488
You’re all fucking bullshit,
I promise you.

30:57.622 --> 31:01.125
They’re all bullshit, man!  I promise you,
they’re all fucking bullshit.

31:01.192 --> 31:03.628
They don’t give no fuck!

31:05.797 --> 31:07.065
We were standing out here

31:07.165 --> 31:10.368
having a conversation, I was talking
with some friends and family,

31:10.435 --> 31:14.005
some person came through shooting.
I’m tired of this shit, man.

31:15.139 --> 31:16.674
Three people got shot.

31:17.308 --> 31:19.043
My fucking cousin, man.

31:51.276 --> 31:52.610
[Joseph]  It’s Memorial Day weekend.

31:52.677 --> 31:55.246
75 degrees, the weather is perfect.

31:55.313 --> 31:57.015
We’re on the Westside of Chicago.

31:57.081 --> 32:01.019
There’ll be a lot of barbecues,
a lot of dealers, gang members,

32:01.085 --> 32:02.754
lots of street activity.

32:04.088 --> 32:06.424
[Narrator]
This year, in a bid to keep order,

32:06.891 --> 32:10.929
1300 extra police have been deployed 
in a show of force.

32:12.096 --> 32:15.733
Your behavior’s gonna dictate whether 
you go to jail or not, so I’d be cool.

32:23.341 --> 32:26.177
You don’t smoke cannabis 
but the car smells like cannabis.

32:26.277 --> 32:27.278
Help me understand.

32:31.816 --> 32:35.386
[Narrrator]  Drug crimes on the Westside 
are already on the rise.

32:45.897 --> 32:47.465
He’s selling Xanax.

32:47.532 --> 32:50.301
They call these bars, Z-bars, Xanies.

32:50.768 --> 32:53.304
They go anywhere from 5 to $15 a pill,

32:53.771 --> 32:55.340
depends on where you get it from.

32:55.406 --> 32:58.076
Those are used much like heroin, 
it’s a downer,

32:58.142 --> 33:01.946
puts ‘em in kind of a dopey state,

33:02.080 --> 33:05.917
give you the similar high to heroin, 
not as euphoric,

33:06.050 --> 33:08.353
but gives them that real relaxed state,

33:10.121 --> 33:13.224
without the sickness and
without the heavy addiction.

33:13.324 --> 33:14.926
Although these are addicting.

33:15.727 --> 33:18.262
You should probably
go to hospital.

33:19.230 --> 33:20.832
Call an ambulance.

33:23.701 --> 33:25.703
Take it easy, all right?
Take it easy.

33:27.939 --> 33:29.841
Before we were able
to get him out of the car,

33:29.907 --> 33:32.076
he swallowed
the narcotics that he was selling.

33:32.176 --> 33:34.612
Gregory, what did you swallow?

33:34.946 --> 33:36.114
Didn’t swallow nothing.

33:36.314 --> 33:40.852
When caught, dealers often swallow 
their drugs to get rid of the evidence.

33:41.452 --> 33:42.787
The fact he’s getting sick.

33:42.854 --> 33:44.555
We’re calling an ambulance right now.

33:44.622 --> 33:46.624
[sirens ringing]

33:51.896 --> 33:54.766
[Joseph] We stopped ‘em and saw
what appeared to be a hand-to-hand.

33:54.832 --> 33:57.735
Then he started...
All this shit coming out of his mouth.

33:57.802 --> 33:59.070
-What did he take?
-I don't know.

33:59.137 --> 34:01.139
He said he didn’t swallow anything,
he’s having anxiety,

34:01.205 --> 34:03.408
but it looks like he swallowed
whatever he had.

34:03.474 --> 34:05.276
-But he’s not telling us.
-Where is he?

34:05.376 --> 34:08.913
Right there.  He’s got all this crap 
coming out of his mouth.

34:09.213 --> 34:11.182
I want to see your eyes, okay?

34:11.382 --> 34:14.485
It's very important to talk to me 
and give me information.

34:15.186 --> 34:16.587
It was noted that

34:16.654 --> 34:19.223
you possibly took some medicine 
and put it in your mouth.

34:19.290 --> 34:22.627
I don't want you to get hurt. 
You could get really sick or hurt.

34:22.693 --> 34:24.962
-I'm okay.
-Let me check your pulse.

34:25.696 --> 34:27.632
[Joseph]  He could overdose and die.

34:27.698 --> 34:29.967
It could burn up your stomach lining.

34:30.968 --> 34:34.472
We’ll take him to hospital and give him...

34:36.507 --> 34:38.409
It’s basically a potion, a syrup

34:38.476 --> 34:41.712
that’ll dissolve everything in his system

34:41.979 --> 34:43.281
and hopefully...

34:43.881 --> 34:44.816
Hopefully...

34:48.453 --> 34:51.222
he’ll have a decent recovery here.

34:51.289 --> 34:53.724
Do you wanna go to the hospital,
get checked out?

34:53.791 --> 34:55.760
I’m straight. I didn't take nothing.

34:55.827 --> 34:57.962
You don’t think you need
to be checked out?

34:58.029 --> 34:59.964
-I'm perfectly fine.
-Okay.

35:00.531 --> 35:01.732
[Narrator]  With no evidence,

35:01.799 --> 35:04.335
the man was released without charge.

35:07.438 --> 35:09.807
That’s what we do, all day, all night.

35:09.874 --> 35:13.077
Just keep knocking ‘em down, 
making those investigative stops.

35:24.255 --> 35:26.524
[Narrator]  With police all over the hood,

35:26.591 --> 35:29.093
JD and Low stay off the streets...

35:29.727 --> 35:32.230
and deal direct from their stash house.

35:33.164 --> 35:36.200
[Low] It’s a dog eat dog world, 
so we staying out of harm’s way.

35:36.267 --> 35:39.070
We don’t have to be out
in the jungle standing on the curb,

35:39.137 --> 35:41.139
we can sit here and answer the door.

35:41.606 --> 35:44.442
[Narrator]  The rest of their crack
is hidden in the basement.

35:44.509 --> 35:47.478
You don’t wanna carry everything 
that you got on you at once.

35:47.578 --> 35:50.081
That’s just stupid, you know.

35:50.181 --> 35:53.417
So you just wanna keep 
a little bit at a time on you,

35:53.751 --> 35:56.287
and if they need some more, 
you gonna get some more.

35:56.354 --> 35:58.022
[phone ringing]

35:58.089 --> 35:59.290
-Hello?
- Hello?

35:59.357 --> 36:01.993
Hey J, it’s Teresa. 
Can I get a dub out of you?

36:02.059 --> 36:03.628
All right, come to the back.

36:03.828 --> 36:05.563
-All right, I’m there now.
- All right.

36:05.663 --> 36:07.265
Get the door G.

36:25.716 --> 36:26.951
[Low] What's up?

36:27.018 --> 36:30.054
-[Teresa] Can I get a dud? It’s all I got.
-Yeah, come on.

36:30.154 --> 36:33.391
-Is it okay if I take a hit here?
-Yeah, it's fine.

36:34.091 --> 36:36.961
[Narrator]
Teresa is a transgender prostitute.

36:39.830 --> 36:41.499
And a crack addict.

36:41.566 --> 36:45.503
I'm 50 years old and I've been doing
crack cocaine since I was 25 .

36:45.570 --> 36:49.273
My first time someone introduced me to it,
it knocked me off my feet.

36:50.942 --> 36:53.110
[Teresa]  Working the streets is scary.

36:53.211 --> 36:55.146
And I’ve been robbed, I’ve been raped.

36:56.247 --> 36:58.516
And crack cocaine
makes me feel good.

37:09.860 --> 37:11.896
[JD] It’s killing you on the inside.

37:11.963 --> 37:13.764
That’s what it’s truly doing to you.

37:21.706 --> 37:24.175
And it’s worth every penny you pay.

37:28.546 --> 37:29.513
What?

37:30.481 --> 37:32.149
[laughs]

37:34.719 --> 37:36.487
[Narrator]  Having taken Teresa’s money,

37:36.587 --> 37:38.222
the dealers want her out.

37:38.289 --> 37:40.458
I’m letting you out the house.

37:41.726 --> 37:44.929
I am too high right now to do all of it.

37:44.996 --> 37:48.165
-[Low] This ain't no lounge.
-I get that.

37:48.866 --> 37:51.369
Police come and see 
that paraphernalia on the counter,

37:51.469 --> 37:53.304
I’m off, I’m going to jail.

37:55.940 --> 37:57.341
[Teresa] Hell, it’s dark out here.

37:57.708 --> 37:59.543
I can't even see.

38:00.244 --> 38:01.379
I appreciate it, babe.

38:01.445 --> 38:04.548
-All right, peeps, come back.  
-Bye-bye.

38:09.220 --> 38:12.056
If something ever happen to her 
and I heard that she died...

38:12.123 --> 38:14.158
Some people choose their own fate.

38:14.225 --> 38:17.161
I seeing what it do to other people, 
you know what I mean?

38:17.261 --> 38:21.966
I get aunties and people that’s out there
that’s on drugs bad, you know?

38:22.033 --> 38:25.236
They deteriorate ‘em,
inside out, you know.

38:26.170 --> 38:28.839
They rotting from the inside out.

38:28.906 --> 38:30.408
They lose the weight,

38:30.474 --> 38:34.045
they not eating consistently,
that’s what they chose to do.

38:34.111 --> 38:37.682
People grown.
You can’t tell them not to do drugs.

38:38.849 --> 38:42.286
Simple as that.  Just cannot tell them 
not to do drugs, you know.

38:45.323 --> 38:47.291
And if they do it,

38:47.391 --> 38:50.227
I wanna make sure they come to me 
instead of somebody else.

38:51.429 --> 38:53.064
[Narrator]  It's catch 22.

38:53.164 --> 38:55.900
To get out of the game,
JD and Low need to capitalize

38:56.000 --> 38:57.902
on the Memorial Day rush.

38:58.369 --> 38:59.670
But the more customers,

38:59.837 --> 39:02.306
the higher the risk they’ll get caught.

39:02.707 --> 39:03.808
Or killed.

39:04.942 --> 39:07.311
[Pauley]
We have three people shot here.

39:07.378 --> 39:09.280
Two were transported to an area hospital.

39:09.347 --> 39:10.781
Another person is dead.c

39:19.023 --> 39:21.025
[indistinctive chatter]

39:23.127 --> 39:24.528
I live right there, bro.

39:24.628 --> 39:26.063
15-22, bro.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.199
Would you please let me go?

39:28.299 --> 39:30.534
I live right there, 15-22, bro.

39:30.601 --> 39:33.304
That was my little brother 
who just got shot, man.

39:33.437 --> 39:34.438
Were you with him?

39:34.505 --> 39:38.175
What do you mean, was I with him?  No!
I just got here, I left the hospital.

39:38.242 --> 39:41.345
I just came from a Memorial Day barbecue,

39:41.412 --> 39:44.615
and now my fucking
little brother gets shot in the face!

39:44.682 --> 39:46.817
Can I go to my home, Sarge?

39:46.951 --> 39:50.154
-For real, Sarge. You know that's my home?
-Relax.

39:50.221 --> 39:51.889
I will let you go home, just relax.

39:51.956 --> 39:55.126
What do you mean?
Ain’t no relaxing right now, Sarge.

39:58.062 --> 40:00.765
That shit crazy as hell, 
I ain’t gonna relax.

40:00.831 --> 40:03.067
I ain't gonna relax!

40:03.134 --> 40:05.336
I go to work. I work, Sarge.

40:05.403 --> 40:07.204
That’s my little brother, Sarge.

40:12.810 --> 40:16.914
[Pauley]
Shooting after shooting after shooting.

40:16.981 --> 40:18.983
12.36am,

40:19.049 --> 40:20.518
person shot.

40:20.584 --> 40:22.353
1.10 am,

40:22.420 --> 40:24.455
just a half an hour later,

40:24.989 --> 40:26.891
we had another person shot.

40:27.691 --> 40:31.061
With another half hour going by,
we had another shooting that left

40:31.128 --> 40:32.797
a man in his 20's shot.

40:32.897 --> 40:35.466
The list continues on and on.

40:36.534 --> 40:38.602
[Narrator]
But the drug trade never sleeps,

40:39.170 --> 40:40.571
and neither can the police.

40:45.009 --> 40:47.011
-[Joseph] Oh, he’s scared.
-[officer] Yes.

40:47.611 --> 40:49.613
Something’s freaking him out.

40:50.448 --> 40:52.450
We’re pretty well hidden, though.

40:52.550 --> 40:54.518
[Narrator]
Joe's unit are meeting an informant

40:54.585 --> 40:56.587
who's just left the crack house.

40:57.788 --> 41:00.257
[Joseph] Go on the other side. Other side.

41:04.128 --> 41:05.162
He's freaked.

41:06.063 --> 41:07.398
[Narrator]  To calm his nerves,

41:07.465 --> 41:10.134
the police drive him
to another location.

41:11.602 --> 41:14.271
[informant]
There’s a guy, he’s selling drugs.

41:14.371 --> 41:17.107
He’s got a pistol in his hand.

41:18.108 --> 41:22.079
I seen the pistol, I was like, whoa! 
I just ran the fuck away.

41:23.647 --> 41:27.017
Remember, I told you, whenever I see 
a pistol, I will call you.

41:27.084 --> 41:29.186
I just seen that motherfucker 
with my own eyes.

41:29.253 --> 41:31.322
-[Joseph] It’s a house or apartment?
-[informant] It's a house.

41:31.388 --> 41:32.857
-On the corner?
-Yeah.

41:32.957 --> 41:34.892
-What’s he wearing?
-Got a black hoodie on.

41:34.959 --> 41:36.293
-Black hoodie?
-Yeah.

41:36.360 --> 41:38.429
-Young kid or old kid?
-No, young kid.

41:39.363 --> 41:41.198
-Fat or...
-Slim.

41:41.265 --> 41:43.801
[informant] It’s this house right here,
the first house right there.

41:47.838 --> 41:50.541
[Narrator]
Joe's unit head back to the crack house.

41:51.876 --> 41:53.410
[joseph] This informant’s credible,

41:53.511 --> 41:57.815
he’s been positive with just about every 
bit of information he’s ever given us.

41:57.882 --> 42:00.017
My gut tells me that there’s narcotics...

42:01.185 --> 42:03.254
and quite possibly firearms.

42:05.122 --> 42:08.359
[Narrator]  JD and Low have sold 
nearly all their crack.

42:09.159 --> 42:10.694
Time keeps ticking.

42:10.761 --> 42:11.829
Things don't stop.

42:11.896 --> 42:14.965
Probably made more
than I ever made out there.

42:18.669 --> 42:20.738
[Narrator]
Joe's unit have arrived at the address

42:20.804 --> 42:22.806
the informant gave them.

42:24.375 --> 42:26.410
And they send the CI back in

42:26.510 --> 42:28.479
to buy some crack as evidence.

42:29.847 --> 42:32.483
[Joseph] We’re set up southbound Latrobe.

42:32.683 --> 42:36.220
Got one walking northbound,
but he looks like a buyer.

42:37.488 --> 42:39.290
All right, CI’s on the approach.

42:40.791 --> 42:42.793
So he’s made it to the house.

42:47.064 --> 42:48.432
[Joseph[ There’s activity at the house.

42:48.499 --> 42:50.868
You got the same 
three or four walking around.

42:58.142 --> 43:00.377
[Joseph]
He’s a lookout. He’s got his phone.

43:00.644 --> 43:03.681
When they walk the block like that 
in circles with their phone,

43:03.747 --> 43:06.350
it’s basically their communication 
with the spot.

43:08.018 --> 43:09.853
[Narrator]
If the spotters catch on to the cops,

43:09.920 --> 43:12.189
they'll realize the informant's a snitch.

43:12.923 --> 43:15.025
Blood will be spilled.

43:19.229 --> 43:22.299
[Joseph] CI’s coming back down, 
might have been just a quick hand off,

43:22.366 --> 43:24.969
he’s gonna be southbound Latrobe 
heading towards you.

43:25.035 --> 43:26.403
It's good.

43:26.870 --> 43:29.239
The counter south end
has the eyeball,

43:29.306 --> 43:31.609
so the informant was served two $10 bags.

43:32.042 --> 43:34.445
All right, I’m gonna get out of here.

43:39.249 --> 43:41.385
Based on everything we just did,

43:41.552 --> 43:46.123
we will execute a search warrant 
at that house, that target location.

43:48.659 --> 43:52.262
By state law, we have 96 hours 
to execute a search warrant,

43:52.329 --> 43:54.231
once it’s signed by the judge.

44:01.505 --> 44:05.409
[on radio]The target is 
a convicted felon selling crack cocaine.

44:05.476 --> 44:09.013
The target is gonna be in Latrobe, 
city of Chicago, Westside.

44:13.050 --> 44:15.486
We are gonna make a front entry.

44:15.552 --> 44:17.988
How many people are gonna be
in the house is unknown.

44:18.155 --> 44:19.623
All right, we’re moving in.

44:20.024 --> 44:21.258
[Joseph] 10-4, we’re on the move.

44:25.796 --> 44:28.599
All right, nice and easy, slice, 
nice and easy.

44:39.143 --> 44:40.711
[officer] Search police search warrant!

44:43.447 --> 44:44.982
Search police search warrant!

44:47.618 --> 44:49.386
Get down on the ground!

44:49.453 --> 44:51.455
Go, go, go!

44:52.956 --> 44:55.492
[officer] Everybody back! Search warrant!

44:57.061 --> 44:59.563
Turn around! Get back!

45:00.097 --> 45:02.099
Police!

45:06.704 --> 45:09.506
[officer] Hey!  Let’s see your hands!

45:14.378 --> 45:15.412
Coming up!

45:15.479 --> 45:17.648
It’s all right. 
Sit down, relax for a minute.

45:24.088 --> 45:26.256
This is the window
where he serves out of.

45:26.323 --> 45:28.125
That's why the grass is all worn there.

45:28.192 --> 45:30.494
They walk up the gangway,
knock on the window,

45:30.594 --> 45:32.763
get served and walk back.

45:32.896 --> 45:34.898
[Marissa] Can you see anything?

45:36.767 --> 45:39.503
[officer]] This money was rolled up
like this behind here.

45:39.570 --> 45:41.638
-Bag of heroin.
-[officer] Yeah.

45:45.776 --> 45:46.910
Money.

45:47.644 --> 45:50.481
-Money.
-Yeah.

45:50.547 --> 45:52.549
Yeah.

45:54.785 --> 45:57.921
This dealer is selling 
about three different products.

45:57.988 --> 46:01.925
Heroin, Xanax pills,
prescription pills, and marijuana.

46:05.529 --> 46:07.831
[Narrator]
The drugs seized at the stash house

46:07.898 --> 46:09.900
were added to the Memorial Day haul.

46:21.545 --> 46:24.414
Every unit within every department

46:24.481 --> 46:27.484
within every municipality,
city and county-wide,

46:27.551 --> 46:30.487
has experienced 
exactly what you see on this table.

46:30.754 --> 46:32.790
This represents a lot of death,

46:32.856 --> 46:34.191
a lot of tragedy,

46:34.258 --> 46:35.926
a lot of...

46:35.993 --> 46:37.327
A lot of work to do.

46:48.572 --> 46:50.774
As long as they're out there 
doing what they're doing,

46:50.841 --> 46:52.776
we're going to be out there 
doing what we're doing.

47:07.624 --> 47:10.627
A lot of people got shot and killed
Memorial Day weekend.

47:10.694 --> 47:13.330
But we’re still here, we’re standing.

47:13.397 --> 47:15.065
He ain’t got no bullet wounds.

47:15.132 --> 47:18.335
I don’t either.  We straight, 
so we gonna keep it like that.

47:21.438 --> 47:24.408
[Low]
I love where I’m from because it made me

47:24.474 --> 47:26.577
who I am today, of course, but...

47:26.643 --> 47:30.280
there’s too much killing here, I wanna 
show my nephew something different.

47:32.816 --> 47:36.086
[Low] Now we got the money
so we can get out the neighborhood,

47:37.020 --> 47:38.589
open other doors,

47:40.090 --> 47:41.925
take that opportunities.

47:41.992 --> 47:45.462
Hopefully I can get
out of the drug game... forever.

47:50.267 --> 47:52.269
