00:39.639 --> 00:41.106
Hi there.
-Hi.

00:41.207 --> 00:43.300
So glad to see you.

00:43.543 --> 00:45.807
Kathy, could you take that?

00:46.579 --> 00:48.046
Thank you.

00:48.415 --> 00:51.111
It's my job to market this drug for
Bristol-Myers, and I'm telling you,

00:51.217 --> 00:55.017
kids won't go for it
unless it tastes like bubble gum.

00:55.155 --> 00:58.682
-Mr. Crowley, you're late.
-All right. Thank you. Bye.

01:14.874 --> 01:16.569
"Everyone just walked by.

01:16.709 --> 01:20.304
"'Why won't anyone buy our newspaper?'
SpongeBob wondered aloud.

01:20.413 --> 01:23.314
"'They must be rock haters,' said Patrick."

01:23.416 --> 01:27.648
-John! Give it back to me!
-She's mine now!

01:27.754 --> 01:30.314
-Give me a minute, okay?
-Give it back to me, John!

01:30.423 --> 01:32.414
You save our spot. Got it?

01:32.559 --> 01:34.754
You better give me back my Fiona!

01:36.729 --> 01:38.060
Help, Mom!

01:38.731 --> 01:42.599
-Help me! She's trying to kill me!
-I'm gonna get you!

01:42.735 --> 01:45.499
-You can't escape!
-No! Mom, help me!

01:46.473 --> 01:47.906
Just give it back to me.

01:48.641 --> 01:52.737
-Mom! She's trying to kill me!
-Megan Kathryn Crowley.

01:55.648 --> 01:57.946
If you kill your brother,
you cannot have your party.

01:58.084 --> 02:00.075
Why not? He stole Fiona.

02:00.186 --> 02:03.917
I didn't steal her, I kidnapped her.
I'm holding her for ransom.

02:04.023 --> 02:05.820
Release the victim.

02:08.928 --> 02:10.327
Time to get ready for your party.

02:10.830 --> 02:13.128
We've got to get moving on
the product launch.

02:13.266 --> 02:14.824
I'm just waiting on legal, John.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.333
Damn it!

02:16.636 --> 02:18.331
I just missed my train.
I'm gonna have to call you...

02:18.471 --> 02:20.632
I agree. How soon do you need it?

02:20.773 --> 02:23.173
As soon as possible.
I'm presenting to my boss next week.

02:25.512 --> 02:28.572
John, we're loading up the van right now.
Come on!

02:28.681 --> 02:31.343
-Okay, we ready to roll, Kate?
-My name is Jane.

02:31.484 --> 02:34.282
-Kate was yesterday, Mom.
-I am so sorry.

02:34.387 --> 02:36.287
The way the agency shuffles
day nurses on us,

02:36.389 --> 02:39.187
you'd think they'd, you know,
give you a number instead of a name.

02:41.227 --> 02:42.751
Okay, John.

02:43.696 --> 02:46.324
John, come on, get your butt in the car.

02:46.466 --> 02:47.660
John.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.658
-Are you bringing your RipStik?
-Yes.

02:49.802 --> 02:51.702
-Do you have to?
-Yes.

02:54.908 --> 02:56.637
...a pain, that's why.
Wait, I gotta catch a cab.

02:56.743 --> 02:59.109
Hi. Come here. Hey, hey. Hello?

03:02.749 --> 03:05.616
-Daddy's meeting us there, right?
-Absolutely.

03:06.553 --> 03:09.784
I am sure he has everything under control.

03:10.757 --> 03:12.384
Taxi!

03:19.365 --> 03:21.196
You need a hand?

03:21.334 --> 03:24.792
Great. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm kind of in a hurry.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.411
Go.

03:37.550 --> 03:41.213
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

03:41.354 --> 03:42.480
Yes!

03:55.368 --> 03:56.494
Yes!

03:57.036 --> 03:59.061
He totally promised he'd be here by now.

03:59.205 --> 04:01.435
He's on his way, baby. He's on his way.

04:12.418 --> 04:13.749
Hi, guys.

04:17.123 --> 04:18.420
-Get in there and give her a kiss.
-I know.

04:18.558 --> 04:21.220
-I don't wanna hear it. I don't wanna hear it.
-Go, go, go.

04:21.327 --> 04:23.522
Happy birthday. I made it.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.629
-Yay!
-Yay!

04:27.333 --> 04:29.392
Make a wish, Megan.

04:32.639 --> 04:33.731
Who wants cake?

04:33.840 --> 04:35.307
-I do!
-I do!

04:35.942 --> 04:39.275
Line up single file, or no cake for you.

04:39.412 --> 04:42.108
-All right, how many do we have?
-I'm first! Me first!

04:43.082 --> 04:46.108
-No, I'm the big guy.
-Back to the end of the line.

04:54.827 --> 04:58.729
So, where is Fiona going, anyway?

04:59.866 --> 05:01.561
Lollipop Land?

05:02.268 --> 05:05.169
I'm eight, Daddy. I'm not a baby anymore.

05:08.508 --> 05:11.636
She's driving to Antarctica
to see the penguins.

05:11.778 --> 05:15.009
Really? That's pretty far away.

05:17.150 --> 05:20.176
Why doesn't she just go
to the Portland Zoo?

05:20.320 --> 05:21.753
They have a lot of penguins there, too.

05:21.854 --> 05:25.017
-Haven't you ever heard of adventure?
-Yeah.

05:26.459 --> 05:28.086
It's gonna take her years.

05:30.730 --> 05:32.197
Won't she need a suitcase?

05:32.332 --> 05:35.028
It's an adventure.
You don't need a suitcase on an adventure.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.466
Well, I don't know about you,
but if I was going on an adventure,

05:37.570 --> 05:38.764
I would take a suitcase.

05:38.871 --> 05:43.308
-That's 'cause you're a businessman.
-That's right. I am.

05:43.409 --> 05:47.675
And you're eight years old.
And happy birthday. And I love you.

05:47.814 --> 05:49.975
Love you, too, Daddy.

05:50.383 --> 05:54.217
-Good night. See you in the morning.
-Good night.

05:55.922 --> 05:57.446
Nighty-night.

05:59.158 --> 06:01.149
Sweet dreams.

06:05.531 --> 06:07.226
Good night, Dad.

06:14.407 --> 06:16.898
-Good night, Daddy.
-Night, buddy.

08:23.469 --> 08:26.029
-Hello?
-Hello, Dr. Stonehill?

08:27.473 --> 08:30.271
-Are you there? Hello?
-Yeah.

08:31.244 --> 08:35.078
This is John Crowley. I don't know
if you've gotten any of my messages.

08:35.214 --> 08:37.273
-Who?
-John...

08:37.750 --> 08:38.739
Jesus.

08:38.885 --> 08:42.376
I'm interested in speaking with you.
I understand from many researchers...

08:44.891 --> 08:47.052
...having a conversation with you
if that's convenient.

08:47.159 --> 08:48.353
Is this a good time to talk?

08:51.998 --> 08:54.558
Dr. Stonehill? Hello?

08:57.603 --> 09:00.697
-Asshole.
-"Asshole?"

09:42.214 --> 09:43.613
The night nurse just left.

09:46.786 --> 09:48.048
What time is it?

09:50.156 --> 09:51.350
I missed you.

09:54.160 --> 09:58.028
This is pathetic. I'm still dressed.

09:58.731 --> 10:01.859
I could help you with that.

10:17.350 --> 10:20.649
Oh my...Kate!
Hi! You're early.

10:20.753 --> 10:21.720
6:.00.

10:21.821 --> 10:25.382
-Have you met...
-I'm John Crowley.

10:26.225 --> 10:28.090
John is my husband.

10:28.828 --> 10:29.795
Glad to hear it.

10:48.981 --> 10:51.279
Yeah, let's up
her breathing treatments today.

10:51.384 --> 10:55.821
-What's going on?
-Just a cold. She's awfully congested.

10:56.155 --> 11:00.114
-Call the doc just to be on the safe side?
-Yeah, I left word.

11:00.493 --> 11:04.429
Sweetie? I'm gonna go to work, okay?

11:05.031 --> 11:06.521
Feel better.

11:08.501 --> 11:09.866
Bye-bye.

11:11.537 --> 11:14.165
We're already doing great
marketing the drug to physicians.

11:14.306 --> 11:16.968
It's our direct marketing to patients
we need to beef up.

11:17.076 --> 11:18.976
Mr. Crowley, I'm really sorry.

11:19.078 --> 11:21.876
Aileen's on the line,
she really needs to speak to you.

11:22.014 --> 11:24.847
Okay, thank you. I'm just gonna... Hey.

11:24.984 --> 11:28.181
We're at the hospital.
The doc wants Megan under observation.

11:28.487 --> 11:31.513
-ls she all right?
-Just keep your cell with you.

11:31.657 --> 11:34.524
-Okay. Can I do something?
-I'll call you when I know more.

11:34.660 --> 11:38.289
I should really get back to Megan, so I'll call
you as soon as I know anything, okay?

11:38.397 --> 11:39.955
Bye. Love you.

11:49.275 --> 11:50.799
-Excuse me, please.
-Sir?

11:50.910 --> 11:53.640
My daughter, Megan Crowley,
was brought in for observation.

11:53.746 --> 11:57.045
Yeah.
Actually, they're moving her to the lCU.

11:57.183 --> 11:59.014
-Where?
-That way.

12:00.953 --> 12:03.012
-Aileen.
-John.

12:03.389 --> 12:07.416
Has she told you about the trip that Fiona's
taking with her remote-controlled car?

12:07.560 --> 12:10.188
Yeah, yes, she did. You're right.
That's right, sweetie.

12:10.296 --> 12:12.856
You're gonna see
all the penguins, aren't you?

12:12.965 --> 12:15.195
She might send some postcards
or something like that.

12:15.301 --> 12:17.166
-Lots of good stuff to see along the way...
-It's okay.

12:17.269 --> 12:21.000
...Iike icebergs and maybe a polar bear.

12:21.941 --> 12:23.772
How about some seals?

12:43.829 --> 12:48.061
As you know, Pompe patients suffer muscle
deterioration in every part of the body,

12:48.167 --> 12:54.436
so this sort of respiratory complication, well,
that's just an inevitable fact of the disease.

12:58.144 --> 13:01.477
Mr. Crowley, Mrs. Crowley,

13:03.282 --> 13:06.581
Megan is not responding well.

13:07.353 --> 13:11.289
Okay? Now, we've done everything we can,
but she's just...

13:11.423 --> 13:14.824
There's nothing more we can do. I'm sorry.

13:15.661 --> 13:21.622
As you know, she was already well past the
life expectancy, for, you know, Pompe kids.

13:22.701 --> 13:25.898
After all, it's not just her lungs, okay?

13:26.005 --> 13:30.066
Her heart, her liver,
these organs have been compromised

13:30.176 --> 13:33.009
and would've become fatally enlarged.

13:34.113 --> 13:38.447
Now, I wish that we had a drug
to treat Pompe, but we simply don't.

13:39.185 --> 13:41.278
I'm so very sorry.

13:43.789 --> 13:45.313
Look, maybe...

13:45.891 --> 13:51.158
Maybe you can find some small comfort in
knowing that Megan's suffering will be over.

13:51.263 --> 13:55.256
Maybe you can see this as a blessing.

14:30.202 --> 14:31.533
-Megan?
-Help!

14:31.637 --> 14:33.070
-Help! Help!
-Megan?

14:33.205 --> 14:34.900
Help! Help!

14:35.040 --> 14:37.099
Baby girl, can you hear me?

14:37.243 --> 14:39.677
-Please, someone come help!
-321!

14:39.778 --> 14:41.837
-Megan Crowley, room 321, please!
-Code Blue!

14:41.947 --> 14:44.040
-Baby girl, Mama's here, all right?
-Let's go! Page Dr. Heder.

14:44.149 --> 14:45.343
-Asystole!
-Yeah, right through here.

14:45.451 --> 14:47.112
Can you hear my voice?
Can you hear Mama?

14:47.253 --> 14:49.551
-Starting compressions.
-I'll switch her out.

14:49.655 --> 14:51.452
-Over here, please. Quickly.
-Hang in there, Megan.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.491
-Hang in there, baby, okay?
-I need to bag her.

14:53.592 --> 14:55.059
-Aileen?
-Some room right there.

14:55.160 --> 14:56.354
Let us in, all right?

14:56.462 --> 14:58.157
-Please, Mrs. Crowley, let...
-Stop it!

14:58.264 --> 14:59.322
Let us help her!

14:59.431 --> 15:01.126
-Please... Megan!
-Aileen.

15:01.233 --> 15:03.633
-Epinephrine, 0.1 mils per kig.
-Got it.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.636
Still no pulse. No reading.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.968
-Forget the weight, come on, get it in there!
-Aileen, Aileen.

15:08.073 --> 15:09.233
-0.1 epi.
-It's all right.

15:09.341 --> 15:11.366
-Come on, Megs. Come on. Come on.
-lV push.

15:11.477 --> 15:15.641
-Okay, just give the epi a couple seconds.
-Still non-responsive.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.375
-All right, charge the defib.
-Charging.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.940
Your daughter is some fighter.

15:46.312 --> 15:48.507
-She's gonna be okay.
-Oh, my God.

15:48.614 --> 15:52.015
Now, look,
she's still a very sick girl, obviously,

15:52.117 --> 15:57.077
but her vital signs have improved
and I'm cautiously optimistic.

15:59.124 --> 16:02.651
So, I guess you could say
we dodged that blessing, huh?

16:10.169 --> 16:14.265
-Mrs. Crowley, these came for Megan.
-Thanks so much. Thank you.

16:49.508 --> 16:50.634
Hey, John?

16:53.012 --> 16:55.173
Any time you're ready, man.

16:56.081 --> 16:59.073
You gonna tell us
about the product launch?

17:03.622 --> 17:05.249
John, you okay?

17:05.958 --> 17:07.516
I have to go.

17:08.627 --> 17:09.651
John.

17:11.296 --> 17:13.526
-Where you going?
-Nebraska.

17:41.093 --> 17:44.028
Excuse me, please.
There's a gentleman here to see you.

17:52.938 --> 17:55.634
Best make yourself comfortable, hon.

18:18.130 --> 18:19.324
Oh, dear.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.901
Sir, sir.
That's Dr. Stonehill. He just left, I'm sorry.

18:23.001 --> 18:24.662
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

18:25.370 --> 18:26.894
Dr. Stonehill!

18:30.142 --> 18:31.973
Hey, Dr. Stonehill!

19:40.112 --> 19:41.704
Dr. Stonehill?

19:43.415 --> 19:45.679
-Yeah?
-I'm John Crowley.

19:47.052 --> 19:49.850
-Okay.
-Didn't you get any of my messages?

19:50.822 --> 19:51.880
What messages?

19:51.990 --> 19:54.288
I left you three or four messages
in the last month,

19:54.393 --> 19:57.123
and you even hung up on me
the night before last.

19:57.229 --> 20:00.892
What the hell are you talking about?
I never hung up on you.

20:01.767 --> 20:04.759
Dr. Stonehill, two of my kids have Pompe.

20:05.938 --> 20:07.530
Oh, Jesus.

20:10.509 --> 20:12.204
Well, I'm sorry.

20:13.011 --> 20:14.706
A terrible disease,

20:14.813 --> 20:17.543
but, hell, you shouldn't have come
all this way without talking to me.

20:17.649 --> 20:20.709
I do research, son. I don't see patients.

20:20.819 --> 20:23.014
Well, it's your research
that I'm interested in.

20:23.121 --> 20:26.887
I've read all the journal articles
on Pompe disease,

20:27.459 --> 20:31.395
and all the researchers out there say
that your work holds the most promise.

20:31.496 --> 20:34.659
Get to the point, son.
What do you want from me?

20:34.766 --> 20:37.564
We almost lost my daughter last week.

20:41.173 --> 20:43.903
I need to hear about your research.

20:48.947 --> 20:51.575
Your kids have a genetic disease.

20:52.551 --> 20:54.075
They're missing an enzyme

20:54.186 --> 20:57.917
which metabolizes
a certain kind of sugar, glycogen.

20:58.023 --> 21:00.992
It's defective in Pompe patients.

21:01.793 --> 21:03.954
So, this sugar builds up in the muscle cells,

21:04.062 --> 21:08.431
especially in the heart, the skeletal muscles,
the diaphragm,

21:08.533 --> 21:10.558
which is why they have
a hard time breathing.

21:10.669 --> 21:14.537
-Yeah, I know. I know a lot about that.
-Everybody's making an enzyme,

21:14.640 --> 21:18.201
but you can infuse kids all day long
with their enzyme,

21:18.310 --> 21:23.043
and it's not gonna do any good
'cause it's not gonna get into their cells.

21:23.181 --> 21:24.205
Understand what I'm saying?

21:24.316 --> 21:25.874
Yeah, so that means
that if you put the sugar...

21:25.984 --> 21:27.315
-Don't interrupt.
-Sorry.

21:27.419 --> 21:30.911
I'm making a different version
of this enzyme.

21:31.023 --> 21:35.551
My enzyme has a biological marker,
mannose 6-phosphate.

21:35.694 --> 21:39.323
I'm the only one that's cloned the gene
for phosphotransferase.

21:39.431 --> 21:42.264
I'm the only one who's cloned the gene
for uncovering enzyme,

21:42.367 --> 21:46.497
so I can get more mannose 6-phosphate
onto the lysosomal protein,

21:46.605 --> 21:51.633
and I can deliver
a more effective amount of enzyme

21:52.577 --> 21:53.737
into the cells.

21:53.845 --> 21:55.676
That's why people are citing my work.

21:55.781 --> 21:57.772
That's why you read my name
in the literature.

21:57.883 --> 22:01.148
I can get more enzyme into the cells.

22:02.587 --> 22:06.250
What's the matter, Sal?
Not up on your glycobiology?

22:07.192 --> 22:08.989
I thought Doc was just your nickname.

22:09.094 --> 22:12.291
No, that man's a genius. He's on the verge
of a scientific breakthrough.

22:12.397 --> 22:14.865
Wow. Who knew?

22:16.802 --> 22:20.670
I'm not on the verge of anything, kid.
This is a theory, not a therapy.

22:20.772 --> 22:22.763
I'm just an academic.

22:22.874 --> 22:26.207
-You got any idea how shitty my funding is?
-No.

22:27.279 --> 22:29.679
University of Nebraska
pays their football coach

22:29.781 --> 22:32.773
more money in a year
than my entire science budget.

22:32.884 --> 22:35.512
Nobody's paying attention to this work.

22:35.620 --> 22:37.815
Half my grants don't get approved.

22:37.923 --> 22:42.257
I don't have the money to make my theory
into a useable medicine.

22:43.395 --> 22:45.295
How old are your kids?

22:46.298 --> 22:47.890
Six and eight.

22:54.406 --> 22:58.809
Look, do yourself a favor.
Go home and spend time with your kids.

23:01.146 --> 23:03.910
Enjoy 'em while they're still here.

23:11.089 --> 23:13.216
-How much?
-How much what?

23:14.092 --> 23:17.152
How much money would it take
to prove your theory,

23:17.262 --> 23:20.720
to create your version of the medicine?

23:21.633 --> 23:25.000
I'd need half a million bucks
just to fund the lab work.

23:25.103 --> 23:28.095
-That's why you need me.
-I need you? Why?

23:28.206 --> 23:32.973
Because I'm the founder of
the Pompe Foundation for Children.

23:35.180 --> 23:37.842
I've been working on this disease
for 10 years.

23:37.949 --> 23:40.577
I have never heard of you guys.

23:40.685 --> 23:45.145
That's because we're relatively new.
We're just in the gearing-up phase.

23:46.057 --> 23:49.891
-How soon do you need a grant?
-Now would be good.

23:49.995 --> 23:54.329
Well, not all the money's in place,
but it will be, and soon.

23:57.135 --> 23:59.433
This is a very exciting time.

24:09.381 --> 24:12.282
-Thanks.
-Thank you, sir. Have a good day.

24:26.198 --> 24:27.392
Hey.

24:31.269 --> 24:32.668
You okay?

24:37.909 --> 24:40.901
-Did you get my messages?
-Your messages?

24:42.547 --> 24:44.447
You suddenly walk out of the meeting

24:44.549 --> 24:47.143
and fly to Nebraska
without talking to me about it,

24:47.252 --> 24:49.413
and you think messages make it okay?

24:49.521 --> 24:51.580
-I'm sorry.
-My God, John.

24:52.190 --> 24:54.681
I wanna find a miracle
as much as you do, okay?

24:54.793 --> 24:57.091
But how could you put your job in jeopardy?

24:57.195 --> 24:58.662
-Aileen.
-How exactly

24:58.763 --> 25:02.130
do we pay $40,000 a month in healthcare
if you lose your insurance?

25:02.234 --> 25:03.701
Honey, come on.
Look, I'm not gonna lose my job.

25:03.802 --> 25:04.860
Oh, really?

25:04.970 --> 25:08.599
Pete called here twice last night
to ask if you were okay.

25:08.707 --> 25:10.504
You know, mentally.

25:17.816 --> 25:21.411
I'll just...
I'll call, and I'll smooth that one over.

25:21.753 --> 25:23.277
Yeah, no shit.

25:28.293 --> 25:29.726
I'm sorry.

25:34.099 --> 25:36.897
Something in me just kind of snapped.

25:37.936 --> 25:42.270
That night at the hospital,
when we thought that we were losing her,

25:47.979 --> 25:51.779
I prayed that if it was her time,

25:54.085 --> 25:58.749
she'd go quickly, without so much suffering.

26:02.427 --> 26:06.727
But morning came, and she pulled through.

26:08.967 --> 26:10.457
Her eyes,

26:12.270 --> 26:15.296
so determined, so defiant.

26:16.541 --> 26:18.304
The fight in her.

26:29.454 --> 26:32.252
Was he worth it? This Stonehill guy?

26:32.357 --> 26:36.020
He's really eccentric, but his science
is way ahead of everybody else's.

26:36.127 --> 26:40.257
-He's definitely the one to put our money on.
-lf we had any.

26:40.365 --> 26:42.595
I promised him that we'd raise some,

26:42.701 --> 26:44.896
because he's got this conference up here
next month,

26:45.003 --> 26:47.369
and I said I'd have a check ready for him.

26:47.472 --> 26:48.632
-How much?
-Five hundred.

26:48.740 --> 26:50.799
-That's all?
-Thousand.

26:52.544 --> 26:54.603
Is it $500 or $1,000?

26:54.879 --> 26:57.143
$500,000.

26:58.216 --> 26:59.774
By next month.

27:05.423 --> 27:09.689
-Sweetheart, are you totally insane?
-Apparently.

27:10.595 --> 27:13.325
We're holding our first fundraiser
on the 23rd at the school,

27:13.431 --> 27:15.797
and we would love
if you and Frank could join us.

27:15.900 --> 27:17.595
-Ready for your spelling test?
-I'm gonna nail it.

27:17.702 --> 27:18.760
Okay. Good luck.

27:18.870 --> 27:21.065
My name's John Crowley.
I'm calling from Oregon,

27:21.172 --> 27:25.632
and I got your name from
the Atlanta-area Pompe parents' group.

27:25.744 --> 27:26.768
Yeah.

27:26.878 --> 27:29.073
And I was so sorry
not to see you at the reunion

27:29.180 --> 27:33.310
because you were one of
my most favorite people in high school.

27:34.185 --> 27:37.677
Anyway, John and l
are starting this foundation.

27:37.789 --> 27:39.518
-Hey, Dad? Dad.
-No, you know what I mean.

27:39.624 --> 27:40.682
Just make it right.

27:40.792 --> 27:43.784
-Dad?
-Can't you see I'm on the phone?

27:43.895 --> 27:46.159
-Okay, well, tell me what he told you.
-Dad!

27:46.264 --> 27:48.824
No, I'm gonna have to call you back.
I can't talk. All right, bye.

27:48.933 --> 27:50.833
-Yeah, what is it?
-I sold my RipStik.

27:50.935 --> 27:51.924
Okay.

27:52.437 --> 27:56.100
Is it enough to give to
Megan and Patrick's foundation?

27:58.777 --> 28:01.041
Yeah, it's more than enough.

28:03.314 --> 28:05.214
-Are you John?
-Yes.

28:05.316 --> 28:08.774
-Marcus Temple. We spoke on the phone.
-Right. Absolutely. Good to see you.

28:08.887 --> 28:11.481
-All the way in from Atlanta.
-Yes.

28:11.589 --> 28:16.686
Well, this is for your foundation,
from my relatives, friends and church group.

28:17.929 --> 28:19.396
My goodness.

28:19.831 --> 28:21.628
Thank you very much.

28:26.805 --> 28:28.102
Thanks.

28:47.425 --> 28:52.522
-Hi, Dr. Stonehill. I'm Megan.
-Hi, Megan. I'm Dr. Stonehill.

28:52.630 --> 28:55.724
Yeah, that's why I said, "Hi, Dr. Stonehill."

28:56.468 --> 28:59.995
-Are you coming in or not?
-Yeah, thanks.

29:02.140 --> 29:03.732
Where's Mom and Dad?

29:03.842 --> 29:05.104
They'll be down in a minute.

29:05.210 --> 29:08.771
Patrick's vent alarm is going off,
so they need to fix it.

29:08.880 --> 29:11.678
His alarm goes off even more than mine.

29:19.891 --> 29:23.224
So, what's your deal? You married?

29:24.462 --> 29:26.123
Do you have a wife?

29:26.631 --> 29:28.462
Ex-wives. Two of 'em.

29:28.566 --> 29:32.195
-Yeah? How come?
-'Cause I'm so easy to get along with.

29:33.071 --> 29:36.472
-Any other questions?
-No. Your turn to ask one.

29:38.977 --> 29:40.467
You're probably wondering
what grade I'm in.

29:40.578 --> 29:43.046
-What grade are you in?
-I'm in third.

29:43.181 --> 29:46.878
My hobbies are video games and penguins.
How about you?

29:47.652 --> 29:51.144
-I already graduated.
-No, I mean hobbies.

29:53.925 --> 29:55.051
Mostly I just work.

29:55.160 --> 29:58.459
Little bass fishing
every once in a while, but...

30:00.832 --> 30:02.231
What's your favorite subject?

30:02.333 --> 30:06.667
I'm good at reading, but I like P.E. best,
especially the sprint races.

30:06.771 --> 30:07.999
Sprint races?

30:08.106 --> 30:10.301
-Wanna see?
-Sure.

30:15.780 --> 30:17.179
Come on.

30:19.851 --> 30:22.149
-ls he here yet?
-I don't know.

30:31.129 --> 30:33.063
I'm gonna win!

30:33.765 --> 30:35.665
Come on, slowpoke.

30:40.038 --> 30:41.733
Yeah, I won!

30:42.640 --> 30:44.005
I won.

30:44.442 --> 30:45.841
Oh, yeah.

30:46.477 --> 30:48.707
Told you I'm gonna beat you.

30:49.747 --> 30:51.009
Hi.

30:52.283 --> 30:54.877
Dr. Stonehill has two ex-wives.

30:54.986 --> 30:57.284
-I see that Megan's introduced herself.
-Yeah.

30:57.388 --> 30:59.379
-How are you, Dr. Stonehill?
-I'm okay, thank you.

30:59.490 --> 31:01.424
-This is Aileen, my wife.
-So nice to meet you.

31:01.559 --> 31:03.686
-And John Jr.
-Hello.

31:03.795 --> 31:05.057
-Here's Patrick.
-Hi.

31:05.163 --> 31:07.927
-Hey, Patrick.
-I think we should probably go inside.

31:08.199 --> 31:09.359
Yeah, come on inside.

31:09.467 --> 31:12.368
Megan, we'll see you inside. Come on.

31:17.842 --> 31:20.106
-Night, Patrick.
-Good night.

31:20.745 --> 31:21.973
Night, SpongeBob.

31:22.080 --> 31:25.447
-You gotta say good night to Dr. Stonehill.
-Kiss SpongeBob.

31:32.323 --> 31:34.257
-Good night.
-Good night, son.

31:35.860 --> 31:37.555
Good night, Patrick.

31:37.662 --> 31:40.825
I'm not gonna say it again. It is bedtime now.

31:41.299 --> 31:42.960
It's for him.

31:45.303 --> 31:49.137
-Me?
-For good luck. For bass fishing.

31:50.174 --> 31:51.402
Thank you.

31:53.945 --> 31:55.674
You like it?

31:55.813 --> 32:00.273
Well, sure. A happy-go-lucky little fellow,
lots of personality, huh?

32:01.219 --> 32:04.154
-He's a plastic toy.
-I know.

32:04.622 --> 32:06.089
Here's the father-daughter dance.

32:06.190 --> 32:09.591
You haven't lived until you've seen
Megan do the Wheelchair Watusi.

32:09.694 --> 32:11.184
Here you go.

32:11.296 --> 32:15.198
-Go ahead and eat the cobbler while it's hot.
-Smells great, honey.

32:16.401 --> 32:17.868
This was hilarious.

32:17.969 --> 32:21.632
Bob, we went to this dude ranch.
All right if I call you Bob?

32:21.739 --> 32:26.676
You got a check for a half-million dollars,
hell, you can call me Peggy Sue.

32:29.647 --> 32:31.171
I'll just...

32:41.793 --> 32:43.317
Well, Bob.

32:43.962 --> 32:48.592
This is the first installment
against the promised half a million.

33:00.011 --> 33:02.707
Tell you the truth,
that's more than I expected.

33:02.814 --> 33:05.908
Dr. Stonehill, we promise that...

33:06.017 --> 33:07.814
-Yeah, I know.
-lf... In enough time, then...

33:07.919 --> 33:09.887
I know. I know.

33:11.489 --> 33:14.822
You can learn a lot about a person
on the lnternet these days.

33:14.926 --> 33:18.418
Learn about a working-class kid
from New Jersey,

33:18.529 --> 33:21.498
worked his way through
Harvard Business School,

33:21.599 --> 33:24.067
clawing his way up the ladder
at Bristol-Myers.

33:24.202 --> 33:25.669
But what Google can't tell you

33:25.770 --> 33:28.238
is that this scared, desperate, bullshitting
son of a bitch...

33:28.339 --> 33:30.102
-Wait just a minute...
-Don't interrupt.

33:30.208 --> 33:33.541
Will do and say whatever it takes
to get results.

33:34.712 --> 33:38.148
Which is why you and me are going
into business together, Jersey.

33:38.249 --> 33:39.409
Excuse me?

33:39.517 --> 33:41.781
I'm tired of begging breadcrumbs
from the university

33:41.886 --> 33:44.446
and giving them the patents to my ideas.

33:44.555 --> 33:47.353
They don't value my work. You do,

33:48.126 --> 33:50.788
which is why I'm setting up my own shop.

33:50.895 --> 33:52.260
Figure any dude in a business suit

33:52.363 --> 33:54.490
can help me raise venture capital
and run the company,

33:54.599 --> 33:59.161
but who's gonna be half as motivated as
a dad who's trying to save his own kids?

33:59.270 --> 34:01.101
So, this is...

34:01.205 --> 34:03.673
So this is the shittiest offer
you're ever gonna get.

34:03.775 --> 34:07.768
I can promise you less money, longer hours,
lousy working conditions,

34:07.879 --> 34:11.838
plus, if we raise the money,
you're gonna have to relocate to Nebraska.

34:16.487 --> 34:18.011
And with the right business plan,

34:18.121 --> 34:22.058
I can also promise you
a working enzyme for Pompe disease.

34:22.827 --> 34:26.695
I can't cure your kids, you know that.
They're always gonna be in wheelchairs,

34:28.065 --> 34:30.728
but I think I can save their lives.

34:35.706 --> 34:37.571
Outstanding cobbler.

34:40.311 --> 34:44.975
Okay, okay.
So, we agree we can't uproot the kids.

34:45.817 --> 34:47.944
What if Stonehill fails?

34:51.489 --> 34:55.391
Or what if he succeeds too late
to help Megs and Patrick?

34:55.493 --> 34:57.825
-Then what?
-I know.

34:58.963 --> 35:03.627
If we're gonna lose them young, you want
to spend every minute you can with them.

35:10.842 --> 35:14.539
John, that day that you flew to Nebraska,

35:14.645 --> 35:18.172
when you suddenly just ditched work and...

35:20.651 --> 35:24.143
My God, I thought you'd lost it.
You scared me.

35:24.889 --> 35:27.449
But once we rolled our sleeves up,

35:27.558 --> 35:31.790
and we started fundraising
and meeting other Pompe families,

35:34.699 --> 35:36.667
it made me feel like...

35:37.101 --> 35:39.331
I mean, do we just accept our fate

35:39.437 --> 35:43.032
and do what we're told
by all the well-meaning doctors

35:44.342 --> 35:48.176
and wait for the worst to happen,
or do we fight it?

35:50.915 --> 35:54.681
I think you're making a mistake. I really do.

35:55.286 --> 35:59.382
Even if you were credible as a CEO,
which you are not,

36:00.758 --> 36:05.661
the odds against you are crushing.
Nine out of 10 biotechs crash and burn.

36:05.763 --> 36:09.995
So where does that leave your kids
when their dad is flat broke

36:10.635 --> 36:14.162
with no job and no health insurance?

36:14.472 --> 36:15.530
Now, if you stay at Bristol,

36:15.640 --> 36:19.872
the guys upstairs are ready to put you in
the VP slot at the end of the third quarter

36:19.977 --> 36:22.172
with a 40%% salary bump.

36:22.980 --> 36:24.174
John.

36:26.050 --> 36:28.814
Your family's gonna need that money,
aren't they?

36:28.920 --> 36:31.650
Pete, you're right. This is crazy.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.924
I'm chasing the wind.

36:36.194 --> 36:38.162
But I can't just

36:40.198 --> 36:43.361
sit around and wait for my kids to die.

36:45.236 --> 36:46.828
I can't do it.

37:09.393 --> 37:12.362
You have arrived at your destination.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.440
Come on in. It's open.

37:30.081 --> 37:31.742
-Hey, there, Bob.
-Hey, John.

37:31.849 --> 37:32.873
How are you?

37:32.984 --> 37:35.248
-You have trouble finding me?
-No problem.

37:35.353 --> 37:37.116
-Sit down.
-Thanks.

37:43.928 --> 37:46.829
Ex-wife. She loved cats.

37:50.635 --> 37:53.297
Well, say, what do we...

37:55.206 --> 37:58.903
What are we gonna do?
How about we work up a strategy

37:59.010 --> 38:01.808
for the meeting at Renzler next week?

38:04.515 --> 38:06.949
We don't need to show those guys anything.

38:07.385 --> 38:08.784
The meeting's a formality.

38:08.886 --> 38:11.446
George Renzler and I have known each other
since med school.

38:11.555 --> 38:16.390
He's been telling me for years that
he'd give me the seed money

38:16.494 --> 38:19.930
if I ever decide to make the big move
and set up my own shop.

38:20.031 --> 38:22.591
Well, that's good. That's good,
but, still, all the same, you know,

38:22.700 --> 38:25.260
if we're gonna go in to pitch 'em,
we should have something tangible.

38:25.369 --> 38:29.533
Those guys understand me.
They're real scientists.

38:30.408 --> 38:33.775
They're not like a lot of
these big biotech moneymen.

38:33.878 --> 38:37.746
Okay. All right, tell you what,
how about if we just talk it through,

38:37.848 --> 38:40.612
and then that way we can just sketch up
something rough on paper?

38:40.718 --> 38:44.017
You give it to me,
I'll make up a business plan.

38:51.062 --> 38:55.761
We need to rough out a real strategy.
These guys are venture capitalists.

38:55.866 --> 38:58.027
That rough enough for you?

38:59.904 --> 39:03.135
Bob? Look, Renzler's crucial to us. Without
them onboard, we got zero credibility

39:03.240 --> 39:05.140
-with any of our investors.
-That's why you're here, Jersey!

39:05.242 --> 39:07.506
Whip up some business bullshit
by tomorrow.

39:07.611 --> 39:11.342
-I'm going fishing.
-This is... This is gibberish!

39:11.449 --> 39:13.349
Then you better get busy.

39:13.451 --> 39:14.850
See you.

39:33.971 --> 39:38.601
As you know, the market potential
for an orphan drug is enormous.

39:38.709 --> 39:41.337
If you were still in business school,
I'd give you an A

39:41.445 --> 39:45.711
for all these lovely charts and graphs and...

39:46.217 --> 39:48.048
But school is out.

39:48.152 --> 39:52.054
Most of us here are scientists.
We need to see the science.

39:52.556 --> 39:55.389
Bob, make us believe.

39:58.162 --> 39:59.925
Love to, George.

40:14.145 --> 40:18.912
...the phosphotransferase
and the second uncovering enzyme...

40:24.355 --> 40:27.188
At this point, the challenge
is to scale up this process

40:27.291 --> 40:29.953
to produce kilogram quantities of HPGAA.

40:30.094 --> 40:32.153
And the question is
whether or not it's cost-effective

40:32.296 --> 40:36.733
to contract this work out
or to build our own manufacturing facility.

40:36.834 --> 40:41.999
Either way, we're gonna eventually need
an investment on the order of $10 million.

40:42.606 --> 40:45.734
It's a lot of information
in a short period of time.

40:45.843 --> 40:47.538
Does anybody have any questions?

40:47.645 --> 40:49.613
-This is astonishing.
-Well, thank you, George.

40:49.713 --> 40:52.614
This man is light years ahead of the field.

40:52.950 --> 40:54.247
Okay.

40:54.351 --> 40:57.013
Well, why don't you have your money guys
get together with John

40:57.121 --> 40:59.851
-and work out the business...
-Sounds great.

40:59.957 --> 41:04.018
Of course, we'll need you to explain
some of the mundane stuff, Bob,

41:04.128 --> 41:05.959
the nuts and bolts.

41:06.697 --> 41:08.597
-Nuts and bolts? What...
-Yeah.

41:08.699 --> 41:10.223
You're a brilliant theoretician,

41:10.334 --> 41:14.327
but you've never actually brought
a new drug to market before, right?

41:14.472 --> 41:16.872
No, I've never brought a drug to market.
I haven't.

41:16.974 --> 41:21.809
I mean, for example, how are you getting
the phosphotransferase?

41:22.146 --> 41:25.604
I'm purifying it
out of a lactating bovine udder.

41:26.517 --> 41:29.543
I see. And where are you getting the udders?

41:31.255 --> 41:33.246
From the stockyards.

41:33.357 --> 41:35.985
-Pretty straightforward stuff.
-Not really.

41:36.093 --> 41:39.824
-You can't inject cow protein into people.
-I know that.

41:39.930 --> 41:43.593
The bovine version of the enzyme
is for lab work, for proof of concept.

41:43.701 --> 41:47.296
I'll make a copy of the human enzyme
for actual drug trials.

41:47.404 --> 41:49.668
-What about uncovering enzyme?
-What about it?

41:49.773 --> 41:51.001
How exactly do you plan on making

41:51.108 --> 41:53.303
-an exact replica?
-I'm making it in T-293,

41:53.410 --> 41:54.934
out of human kidney cells.

41:55.045 --> 41:58.139
-Oh, my goodness. No.
-"Oh, my goodness. No?"

41:58.249 --> 41:59.910
No. The FDA will never allow that.

42:00.017 --> 42:02.884
-Hey, Bob, just...
-Wait a second.

42:03.020 --> 42:07.650
For Christ's sake, we will change
the cell line before clinical trials.

42:07.758 --> 42:10.659
You've gotta have that process locked down
long, long before you think about...

42:10.761 --> 42:12.353
Bob, why don't we just take a coffee break...

42:12.463 --> 42:14.954
Why are you talking to me this way?
I don't want any goddamn coffee.

42:15.065 --> 42:17.295
Bob, can you just tell us
how you're planning to make

42:17.401 --> 42:21.201
the three enzymes
under FDA-approved GMP in...

42:21.305 --> 42:24.468
I'm not here to cross every "t"
and dot every "i", George.

42:24.575 --> 42:28.671
And I'm not here to be poked and prodded
like a first-year med student.

42:28.779 --> 42:31.111
-This is ridiculous.
-Bob.

42:32.449 --> 42:34.178
This is bullshit.

42:40.457 --> 42:41.481
Bob.

42:47.498 --> 42:51.730
Bob, if you can't answer a question,
you say you're working out the details.

42:51.835 --> 42:55.271
You don't storm out on these guys
like some sort of spoiled child, okay?

42:55.372 --> 42:57.897
-Now, we're gonna go back in there.
-No, I'm not going back in there.

42:58.008 --> 43:01.637
We're going back in there.
This is business, Bob. It's not personal.

43:01.779 --> 43:03.804
That was personal.

43:11.021 --> 43:13.922
Stonehill goes and completely sabotages
the meeting.

43:14.024 --> 43:15.082
Thank you.

43:15.192 --> 43:17.956
I mean, he completely blew my plan,
right out of the gate.

43:18.062 --> 43:21.463
Okay, I get that he's a loose cannon,
but do you still believe in his science?

43:21.565 --> 43:26.400
Honey, if I don't raise $10 million in capital,

43:26.503 --> 43:29.666
his science doesn't matter. At all.

43:34.211 --> 43:36.645
What's going on with his arm?

43:37.748 --> 43:39.716
Hey, buddy, you okay?

43:43.821 --> 43:46.847
-You all right?
-I can't throw them anymore.

43:47.891 --> 43:50.519
-When did this happen?
-I don't know.

43:51.595 --> 43:54.723
-You should help him, Daddy.
-That's a good idea.

43:54.832 --> 43:56.732
Okay, here we go. You ready?

43:56.834 --> 44:00.133
-One, two...
-lnto the water.

44:01.271 --> 44:03.899
That was a good shot.
We can do better than that.

44:04.008 --> 44:07.910
Try again.
Let's make, like, a little pellet.

44:08.579 --> 44:10.342
Here, ducky, ducky.

44:16.053 --> 44:17.680
Let's do it again.

44:18.222 --> 44:20.213
Ready? One, two, three.

44:20.791 --> 44:22.520
Give me another piece, John.

44:23.761 --> 44:25.752
I can just throw them.

44:27.698 --> 44:31.099
And you do all the laughing,
and I'll do all the throwing.

44:31.802 --> 44:32.996
That's good, the ducky shared.

44:33.103 --> 44:34.900
-Did you see that?
-Yeah.

44:42.379 --> 44:43.539
John?

44:46.617 --> 44:49.108
-We're out of time.
-I know.

44:51.422 --> 44:55.688
He doesn't have the strength
to throw a piece of bread to a duck.

44:59.129 --> 45:02.030
-lt scares the hell out of me.
-Me, too.

45:04.334 --> 45:07.098
John, what are you doing?

45:07.604 --> 45:10.903
I'm offering Renzler a deal
he can't turn down.

45:36.166 --> 45:38.657
Excuse me. Morning. Dr. Renzler?

45:39.369 --> 45:40.927
Dr. Renzler?

45:41.538 --> 45:43.335
Sir, good morning.

45:43.807 --> 45:44.933
-John Crowley.
-Crowley?

45:45.042 --> 45:46.168
-Yes, sir.
-What are you doing here?

45:46.276 --> 45:47.265
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

45:47.377 --> 45:50.437
I understand from your secretary that
you're going to be leaving for France

45:50.547 --> 45:51.741
-for a month.
-That's right.

45:51.849 --> 45:53.339
I have a proposal for you,
and I was hopeful

45:53.450 --> 45:55.850
-that you could take a look at it.
-We're running late for a flight.

45:55.953 --> 45:59.411
I appreciate that. It'll only take a second,
just to have a quick read.

45:59.523 --> 46:01.684
-Fine. I'll read it in the car.
-lt might interest you.

46:01.792 --> 46:03.191
Good, thank you.

46:18.475 --> 46:21.467
-Does Stonehill know about this?
-Of course.

46:22.146 --> 46:25.115
And he's okay with these terms?

46:26.250 --> 46:28.616
All I need is your signature.

46:54.278 --> 46:55.472
Hello?

47:03.287 --> 47:04.379
Bob.

47:07.591 --> 47:08.819
Bob.

47:10.727 --> 47:11.853
Bob!

47:12.963 --> 47:14.396
Over here.

47:15.599 --> 47:16.725
Bob.

47:21.371 --> 47:22.497
Bob!

47:24.208 --> 47:25.766
Hi. Bob.

47:35.719 --> 47:37.311
What'd you do to yourself?

47:37.421 --> 47:41.221
-I got the investment from Renzler.
-You what?

47:41.325 --> 47:43.384
Listen, I want you to

47:45.229 --> 47:46.696
think about something before you read that.

47:46.797 --> 47:47.855
What the hell is this?

47:47.965 --> 47:52.402
Under the circumstances,
this is the best deal that we could ever get.

47:52.936 --> 47:57.236
This isn't a deal.
This is the terms of our surrender, for...

47:57.341 --> 47:59.502
Renzler comes in
for a couple of million now,

47:59.610 --> 48:02.704
and you give him the option
of jumping in as a full partner later?

48:02.813 --> 48:05.873
Well, after sabotaging our meeting,
I had to do something dramatic.

48:05.983 --> 48:09.441
And you promise him
we'll be in clinical trials in a year?

48:09.586 --> 48:11.645
We can do this, Bob. All right?

48:11.788 --> 48:13.779
We work harder, we push ourselves,
we work around the clock.

48:13.924 --> 48:16.188
I already work around the clock!

48:16.293 --> 48:19.057
Why don't you just give 'em
my balls in a jelly jar?

48:19.162 --> 48:21.562
There's no other way I could get them
to come back to the table.

48:21.665 --> 48:23.929
Who needs the bastards anyway!

48:24.034 --> 48:28.698
Without Renzler, there's no reason for us
to even think about other venture groups.

48:28.805 --> 48:31.672
Fine! Then I won't think
about other venture groups!

48:31.775 --> 48:33.174
Great!

48:33.277 --> 48:38.374
Spend the rest of your life dreaming up
great ideas that don't get funded.

48:38.482 --> 48:42.748
Draw brilliant diagrams on the wall
that cure diseases in theory,

48:43.320 --> 48:46.585
but never help a single human being
in reality.

49:21.892 --> 49:23.860
What'd you do? Let me see it.

49:23.994 --> 49:26.485
-It's just barely...
-Let me see.

49:31.768 --> 49:33.633
Put pressure on it.

49:40.844 --> 49:42.971
Got your blood all over this thing.

49:43.080 --> 49:46.345
Want me to add a drop of mine,
make it official?

49:49.286 --> 49:51.686
Or would a signature suffice?

50:05.969 --> 50:07.061
Bob?

50:51.314 --> 50:55.182
I'm not paying a dollar more
than 22,000 a unit, okay?

50:55.285 --> 50:56.274
I'm not doing it.

50:58.989 --> 51:00.217
Hi, Bob.

51:05.796 --> 51:08.230
These guys make me feel old.

51:09.266 --> 51:13.100
Scientists get all sensible and careful
when they get old.

51:13.203 --> 51:15.535
Young ones like risk,

51:15.639 --> 51:17.834
not afraid of new ideas,

51:20.844 --> 51:23.074
and you can pay 'em less.

51:25.682 --> 51:30.585
We all believe in Bob Stonehill's
bold vision, otherwise you wouldn't be here.

51:30.687 --> 51:33.918
But to reach clinical trials inside of a year,

51:34.624 --> 51:39.459
I'm gonna have to ask you
to commit to a brutal schedule.

51:39.563 --> 51:45.024
Ladies and gentlemen,
reset your watches to Priozyme Time.

51:49.172 --> 51:51.800
-How long?
-Three, four hours.

51:56.580 --> 51:59.515
Well, if you can get it any quicker,
that'd be good.

51:59.649 --> 52:01.173
I'll try.

52:09.192 --> 52:10.489
Come on.

52:11.161 --> 52:13.789
-Vinh, check the breakers.
-Got it.

52:17.701 --> 52:22.161
-No, the whole building's out.
-Well, get the backup generator going.

52:22.706 --> 52:25.231
-We...
-Wait, wait, wait.

52:25.342 --> 52:27.970
You never bothered
to buy a backup generator?

52:28.078 --> 52:29.739
We're in the middle of tornado country,

52:29.846 --> 52:31.575
-for Christ's sake!
-Yeah, so I'm a meteorologist?

52:31.681 --> 52:36.414
If I don't have my refrigeration back
in 45 minutes, I lose the whole cell line.

52:36.553 --> 52:38.851
Four months of work pissed away!

52:38.955 --> 52:41.890
It was never in the budget.
We never had the money for it.

52:43.393 --> 52:46.851
-I'm sorry, sir. Your card, it's been denied.
-What?

52:47.764 --> 52:51.757
It got maxed out.
I bought the roller bottle unit for the lab.

52:51.868 --> 52:53.426
Shit, l...

52:56.106 --> 53:00.304
Just pay me back by the end of the month,
or I lose my apartment.

53:00.410 --> 53:02.571
Hi, here you go. Thanks.

53:05.715 --> 53:06.943
Yes!

53:09.886 --> 53:11.046
Yes!

53:14.791 --> 53:16.053
Sir.

53:18.395 --> 53:19.794
Thank you.

53:31.808 --> 53:35.574
Fiona's in Mexico this week.
They've got pyramids there.

53:37.180 --> 53:41.014
She's still got lots of things to see
before she gets to Antarctica.

53:41.117 --> 53:42.414
Yeah.

53:47.290 --> 53:50.726
She's gonna chop up
all the penguins with an ax.

53:50.827 --> 53:54.285
And feed their bloody
remains to the walruses.

53:54.598 --> 53:55.963
I see.

53:57.834 --> 53:58.858
What?

53:58.969 --> 54:02.029
Every time you come home for the weekend,
you don't even listen to me.

54:02.138 --> 54:03.469
Megs.

54:04.507 --> 54:06.998
You know what, you're right. I'm sorry.

54:07.110 --> 54:09.670
It's just that I've been so busy

54:09.779 --> 54:12.873
trying to make the special medicine
for you and Patrick.

54:12.983 --> 54:15.747
-I want it pink.
-You want what?

54:15.852 --> 54:18.946
The special medicine. I want it to be pink.

54:20.223 --> 54:23.522
Okay. I guess I can ask Dr. Stonehill.

54:23.627 --> 54:28.860
Tell him dark pink, like this.
Not light pink. That's for babies.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.160
Okay.

54:35.272 --> 54:36.364
Here you go.

54:36.473 --> 54:39.840
Dr. Renzler, be reasonable.
The company is only six months old,

54:39.943 --> 54:42.935
and we are making great progress
towards in vivo testing.

54:43.046 --> 54:45.810
I don't know.
The way the company is burning money...

54:45.915 --> 54:48.213
Well, we've got to get a leg up
on the competition.

54:48.318 --> 54:51.685
You know that Zymagen has
far more spending power than we do.

54:51.788 --> 54:54.018
So, what you're saying,
I should have invested in Zymagen.

54:54.124 --> 54:57.287
No, what I'm saying is,
is that we've got to beat 'em to the punch.

54:57.394 --> 54:59.794
Either that, or scare them into buying us out.

54:59.929 --> 55:03.729
Well, you're scaring us investors a hell of
a lot more than you're scaring Zymagen.

55:04.134 --> 55:06.102
You sell the company to Zymagen,

55:06.303 --> 55:08.897
you're in clinical trials
by the end of the fiscal year,

55:09.005 --> 55:12.497
or we pull the plug and cut our losses.
Goodbye.

55:15.111 --> 55:16.339
Hello?

55:25.388 --> 55:28.186
This construct's looking pretty good,

55:28.291 --> 55:33.388
but we gotta get better cleavage
between the alpha and the beta subunits.

55:33.496 --> 55:36.363
Well, what if we add a furin site
like the one in uncovering enzyme?

55:36.466 --> 55:38.093
Why would you wanna do that?
Doesn't it have its own...

55:38.201 --> 55:39.395
We need to talk.

55:39.502 --> 55:41.129
-I'm busy.
-You're always busy.

55:41.237 --> 55:42.761
You always wanna talk.

55:42.872 --> 55:47.434
Yeah, we could add furin
and try and cleave it before purification.

55:49.412 --> 55:50.970
What are you doing?

55:51.081 --> 55:53.481
-Giving you a preview...
-Guys, would you excuse us for a minute?

55:53.583 --> 55:57.815
...of what's going to happen
if we are not in clinical trials in four months.

55:57.921 --> 56:00.719
Our investors will turn out the lights.

56:03.426 --> 56:06.293
Science takes time, Jersey.
Don't they understand?

56:06.396 --> 56:08.227
Yeah, they do.
They can read the Wall Street Journal.

56:08.331 --> 56:12.097
They see that Zymagen
is testing three different Pompe drugs.

56:12.202 --> 56:14.898
They're testing three 'cause they don't know
what the hell they're doing.

56:15.004 --> 56:19.407
-I'm testing one 'cause it's the right one!
-I know. I believe you, Bob.

56:19.542 --> 56:22.477
Why else do you think
I put up with all your shit?

56:22.579 --> 56:23.807
Look.

56:25.348 --> 56:30.752
I want you to go toe-to-toe
with Zymagen's scientists.

56:30.854 --> 56:34.585
-Prove to them that your enzyme is best.
-I can do that.

56:34.724 --> 56:36.954
That's the reason I've entered
into conversations with them

56:37.060 --> 56:39.358
to buy our company.

56:39.462 --> 56:41.794
You're telling me? You're not asking me?

56:41.898 --> 56:46.267
Come on, Bob.
I am just being fiscally responsible.

56:46.369 --> 56:50.032
Nobody is gonna tell me how to run my lab!

56:50.140 --> 56:53.667
If I can engineer a deal,
and that is a really big "if,"

56:53.777 --> 56:56.302
you're going to have to forgive me
for all the money I'm gonna make you.

56:56.413 --> 56:58.347
I don't care about money.

56:58.448 --> 57:02.407
I'm a scientist.
I care about more important things than that.

57:02.919 --> 57:06.855
Don't you tell me about
more important things to care about.

57:08.124 --> 57:09.716
Do the math.

57:10.727 --> 57:16.029
Either we sell the company
and get a huge cash infusion,

57:17.801 --> 57:20.361
or the investors will shut us down.

57:30.346 --> 57:32.075
Where you going?

57:36.186 --> 57:40.623
I'm gonna go take a crap,
if that meets with your fiscal approval.

57:59.843 --> 58:03.040
What, they can't drive from the airport
like ordinary people?

58:03.146 --> 58:05.614
Bob, we need to make this happen.

58:07.617 --> 58:09.744
They're gonna ask us some tough questions.

58:10.186 --> 58:14.350
Don't take 'em personally, all right?
All right?

58:26.069 --> 58:29.527
These lab results confirm
what I've been preaching for years,

58:29.706 --> 58:33.472
that phosphorylation is key
to enzyme absorption.

58:34.344 --> 58:36.812
My theory works for Pompe,

58:36.913 --> 58:40.781
and eventually it'll work for
enzyme replacement therapies

58:40.884 --> 58:43.648
for other lysosomal storage disorders.

58:44.254 --> 58:47.382
-ls it too complicated?
-Too complicated?

58:47.490 --> 58:51.517
The number of variables built into
your approach are mind-boggling.

58:51.628 --> 58:54.961
I mean, Jesus, if you get even
one piece wrong in the synthesis,

58:55.064 --> 58:58.124
just one carbohydrate ends up
in the wrong position...

58:58.234 --> 59:01.533
Well, it's gotta be done right,
like anything worth doing.

59:02.071 --> 59:04.835
You've never actually gotten
a drug approved.

59:04.941 --> 59:09.844
Isn't it naive to think you can solve
these kinds of manufacturing challenges?

59:15.685 --> 59:17.812
Bob? Bob?

59:19.122 --> 59:21.818
You're right, I'm a theory guy.

59:22.792 --> 59:24.987
My head is in the clouds.

59:26.930 --> 59:29.057
Which is why we need you.

59:31.634 --> 59:33.932
Unless, of course, your reputation

59:34.070 --> 59:37.904
for solving protein-manufacturing problems
is undeserved.

59:40.076 --> 59:41.441
Nice one.

59:42.545 --> 59:47.380
-I still need to hear about profitability.
-Certainly, certainly.

59:47.917 --> 59:53.287
As you know, this is not
a one-time treatment. It's a lifelong therapy.

59:53.389 --> 59:55.186
And these patients,

59:55.291 --> 01:00:01.230
they are going to generate revenue
over the span of their lifetime that is...

01:00:01.331 --> 01:00:05.461
But even if you make a usable enzyme,
clearly it won't work for all patients.

01:00:05.568 --> 01:00:09.060
So, what survival rate do we need
to achieve a robust profit?

01:00:09.172 --> 01:00:13.131
What rate of patient death
can be defined as acceptable loss?

01:00:14.077 --> 01:00:16.068
Acceptable loss?

01:00:21.818 --> 01:00:23.945
I understand the question.

01:00:26.656 --> 01:00:32.595
Because the profit margins on this
orphan drug are so incredibly high, the...

01:00:33.963 --> 01:00:39.697
Even with a mortality rate of,
say, 25%% over five years still indicates

01:00:39.802 --> 01:00:45.763
that there is a highly lucrative
revenue source to be realized.

01:01:00.857 --> 01:01:03.087
Gentlemen, we have a deal.

01:01:50.707 --> 01:01:53.505
Dr. Robert Stonehill to see Barry Renee.

01:01:56.913 --> 01:02:00.212
I have a Dr. Robert Stonehill
to see Dr. Renee.

01:02:02.351 --> 01:02:05.343
-Sir, you need to be cleared.
-I'm just gonna use the restroom.

01:02:05.455 --> 01:02:08.356
-You need to be cleared to do that, sir.
-Just need to...

01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:11.689
-You need a security badge.
-Jesus.

01:02:15.431 --> 01:02:18.992
Well, can I have a security badge
so I can go take a pee?

01:02:19.202 --> 01:02:20.897
Yes, sir. He will give that to you.

01:02:29.278 --> 01:02:31.838
-Hey, Bob.
-Hey, John.

01:02:31.948 --> 01:02:34.075
You getting comfortable?

01:02:34.951 --> 01:02:36.885
Define "comfortable."

01:02:41.290 --> 01:02:43.451
You haven't cashed it yet?

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:46.418
I haven't earned it yet.

01:02:47.463 --> 01:02:50.455
I'll cash it when we have a usable enzyme.

01:03:08.918 --> 01:03:11.512
Well, it sure is beautiful.

01:03:17.527 --> 01:03:19.290
It sure is big.

01:03:20.363 --> 01:03:22.160
The kids love it.

01:03:29.438 --> 01:03:31.099
Seize the day.

01:03:35.578 --> 01:03:36.875
Okay.

01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:49.080
I'm stuck on this call.

01:03:49.192 --> 01:03:52.355
Just wanted to let you know how thrilled
we are to have you onboard, John.

01:03:52.461 --> 01:03:54.088
It's an honor.

01:03:54.797 --> 01:03:56.924
-You remember Dr. Kent Webber.
-Of course.

01:03:57.033 --> 01:03:58.432
-It's good to see you again.
-Good to see you, too.

01:03:58.534 --> 01:04:01.401
I'll let the two of you get into it.

01:04:01.504 --> 01:04:04.667
-I'm expecting great things.
-Yes, sir.

01:04:08.611 --> 01:04:13.446
I've got some pretty good ideas
about how to help the flow of information

01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:15.540
between the four core enzyme groups.

01:04:15.651 --> 01:04:19.052
Whoa, John, slow down.
That's not our established procedure.

01:04:19.155 --> 01:04:20.247
Pardon me?

01:04:20.356 --> 01:04:24.190
The four core teams are essentially
in competition with each other.

01:04:24.293 --> 01:04:27.285
It's an entrepreneurial model. It works.

01:04:27.396 --> 01:04:32.095
I'm all for competition,
but surely there must be some channel

01:04:32.201 --> 01:04:38.868
for allowing sharing scientific insights
that can help develop all four enzymes.

01:04:39.242 --> 01:04:43.975
John, in the interest of saving us time,
let me be blunt.

01:04:45.248 --> 01:04:47.443
Most of the scientists here don't like the idea

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:51.646
of having a non-scientist
as senior VP of the Pompe program.

01:04:53.189 --> 01:04:55.214
Especially one whose objectivity

01:04:55.324 --> 01:04:59.055
might be clouded
by having children with the disease.

01:05:00.196 --> 01:05:03.393
I'm telling you this
in your own best interests.

01:05:03.933 --> 01:05:06.299
Erich wanted to buy Stonehill's ideas,

01:05:06.402 --> 01:05:11.032
and he couldn't do that without also
swallowing you as part of the pill.

01:05:13.776 --> 01:05:17.872
My advice to you, John,
is to keep your head down.

01:05:20.850 --> 01:05:24.342
-Thank you for that wisdom.
-You're very welcome.

01:05:28.557 --> 01:05:29.525
All of your lab notebooks must be submitted
to the review committee!

01:05:29.525 --> 01:05:31.493
All of your lab notebooks must be submitted
to the review committee!

01:05:31.594 --> 01:05:34.085
This is my lab now! Get out!

01:05:34.196 --> 01:05:36.426
I'm just trying to explain the protocol!

01:05:36.532 --> 01:05:39.501
-You're wasting my time.
-Dr. Stonehill...

01:05:40.036 --> 01:05:41.264
Fine.

01:05:47.243 --> 01:05:48.540
What do you want?

01:05:49.245 --> 01:05:54.273
I just dropped by to say that I think
that we might be missing an opportunity

01:05:54.417 --> 01:05:57.250
to open a dialogue
with the other three core teams.

01:05:57.386 --> 01:06:00.947
The other core teams? Core teams.

01:06:01.090 --> 01:06:02.580
Core bullshit.

01:06:03.559 --> 01:06:05.789
I'll come back another time.

01:06:09.498 --> 01:06:12.626
The decline in muscle strength
is very troubling, of course,

01:06:12.735 --> 01:06:16.068
but it's really, in both kids,

01:06:16.172 --> 01:06:20.734
the organ enlargement, the liver,
and especially the heart,

01:06:20.843 --> 01:06:23.641
that's the real threat to their lives.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:27.677
We'll continue to monitor
the rate of cardiac enlargement.

01:06:27.783 --> 01:06:30.877
-We'll keep tabs on their other organs...
-How long?

01:06:32.521 --> 01:06:35.217
-I don't like to predict.
-Please.

01:06:35.324 --> 01:06:38.225
Dr. Waldman, we won't hold you to it.
We just need to know something.

01:06:38.327 --> 01:06:39.885
John.

01:06:40.196 --> 01:06:43.962
How much more time do we have?
How long?

01:06:45.568 --> 01:06:46.967
Well,

01:06:50.239 --> 01:06:53.970
if there's another respiratory crisis,
all bets are off,

01:06:54.643 --> 01:06:57.441
but otherwise,

01:07:00.149 --> 01:07:02.344
Megan, maybe a year.

01:07:02.985 --> 01:07:05.351
Patrick, less.

01:07:08.991 --> 01:07:10.390
Thank you.

01:07:25.274 --> 01:07:26.502
Marcus.

01:07:26.609 --> 01:07:27.667
-Get the phone.
-What?

01:07:27.777 --> 01:07:29.745
-The phone.
-Who is it?

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:33.379
-Hello?
-Hi. Is that Marcus?

01:07:33.516 --> 01:07:36.508
-Yeah, yeah. What time is it?
-Yeah, I'm sorry. It's late.

01:07:37.186 --> 01:07:40.383
-It's John Crowley.
-John, what you doin'?

01:07:41.724 --> 01:07:42.816
You okay?

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:48.726
Hey, look, I gotta ask you a favor.

01:07:49.598 --> 01:07:51.190
-Morning, Gavin.
-Morning, sir.

01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:52.892
Is my 1 1:00 with Henessey confirmed?

01:07:53.002 --> 01:07:56.836
Yes, and there's the breakfast meeting
down in the cafeteria.

01:07:56.939 --> 01:07:58.338
Breakfast meeting?

01:07:58.441 --> 01:08:01.001
There was an e-mail that came in
over the weekend.

01:08:01.110 --> 01:08:02.907
Everyone on the Pompe project was invited.

01:08:03.045 --> 01:08:05.980
-Who called the meeting?
-Mr. Crowley, I believe, sir.

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:07.379
What?

01:08:11.253 --> 01:08:16.417
Something that people ask me all the time
is how we have two kids with Pompe.

01:08:17.259 --> 01:08:21.354
By the time we realized
that Megan had Pompe,

01:08:22.363 --> 01:08:24.457
I was already pregnant with Patrick.

01:08:24.567 --> 01:08:27.365
I mean, I can't tell you
how many doctors we saw,

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:29.198
and the message was always the same,

01:08:29.305 --> 01:08:32.502
that there is no drug to treat Pompe.

01:08:32.608 --> 01:08:36.442
But thanks to you, all of you,
that message is changing.

01:08:36.545 --> 01:08:41.005
What you've given us,
and a lot of other families, is hope.

01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:42.675
So, thank you.

01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:45.783
Good job, Aileen.

01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:51.651
Now I'd like to welcome the Temple family,

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:55.787
who've come all the way from Georgia
to be with us here today.

01:09:01.604 --> 01:09:03.231
Thanks, John.

01:09:06.408 --> 01:09:07.602
Hi.

01:09:09.178 --> 01:09:10.770
I'm Marcus.

01:09:11.913 --> 01:09:14.075
This is my wife, Wendy.

01:09:14.183 --> 01:09:17.084
Our daughter Lauren, our oldest daughter,

01:09:17.185 --> 01:09:22.145
Lauren wanted to come today
and say hi to all you guys.

01:09:24.193 --> 01:09:25.683
She's a little weak,

01:09:25.794 --> 01:09:30.925
but she wanted us
to show you guys her picture

01:09:31.433 --> 01:09:34.060
and to send you her love.

01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:38.201
And this is our daughter, Megan.

01:09:38.307 --> 01:09:41.743
The most beautiful girls are named Megan.

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:46.975
Megan is four months old,
and you can't see it yet,

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:50.341
but she has Pompe, too.

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:05.665
I...

01:10:07.703 --> 01:10:11.639
I can't tell you what it means to us

01:10:13.342 --> 01:10:17.711
to have all of you working on a medicine
for our children.

01:10:20.482 --> 01:10:21.881
Thank you.

01:10:28.691 --> 01:10:30.318
Thanks so much.

01:10:38.767 --> 01:10:40.894
-Hey, Kent.
-John.

01:10:41.003 --> 01:10:43.631
So what did you think of the event?

01:10:49.111 --> 01:10:54.515
In medical research, John,
objectivity is key.

01:10:56.018 --> 01:10:59.112
If researchers get all emotional,

01:10:59.221 --> 01:11:03.817
all desperate to help suffering patients,
they'll cut corners.

01:11:03.926 --> 01:11:05.120
It's counterproductive.

01:11:05.227 --> 01:11:09.960
Counterproductive is having
four core teams of scientists

01:11:10.065 --> 01:11:14.502
working together on the same disease,
but not talking to each other.

01:11:15.037 --> 01:11:18.370
Most of these guys have never
even seen a kid with Pompe before.

01:11:18.474 --> 01:11:20.237
I don't see how that's relevant.

01:11:20.376 --> 01:11:24.608
Did you see Erich?
That's the kind of motivation that we need.

01:11:24.713 --> 01:11:29.150
I'm gonna ask him to get the core team
to stop competing, start working together.

01:11:29.251 --> 01:11:31.515
Create a leadership team.

01:11:33.589 --> 01:11:37.150
Well, if you hope to sell
this leadership team idea,

01:11:37.259 --> 01:11:39.454
there's only one way to convince Erich.

01:11:39.561 --> 01:11:40.892
And what's that?

01:11:40.996 --> 01:11:43.863
Keep your guy, Stonehill, off the team.

01:11:44.733 --> 01:11:50.228
In his short tenure here, he's managed to
alienate a remarkable number of colleagues.

01:11:50.339 --> 01:11:53.331
You can't put him on a team
that's supposed to build cooperation.

01:11:53.442 --> 01:11:57.435
So, decide how badly
you want your leadership team,

01:11:59.014 --> 01:12:01.380
then do what you have to do.

01:12:13.495 --> 01:12:14.928
That's it.

01:12:20.803 --> 01:12:22.771
Dr. Stonehill, please.

01:12:23.605 --> 01:12:25.732
Turn it down. Yes.

01:12:26.275 --> 01:12:28.106
Yes, the music.

01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:33.245
I said down!

01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:36.781
This guy's impossible.

01:12:36.885 --> 01:12:38.682
I like that song.

01:12:45.527 --> 01:12:46.687
Hey.

01:12:52.534 --> 01:12:54.297
What's up, John?

01:12:54.803 --> 01:12:57.829
-Everything all right at home?
-Yeah.

01:13:01.009 --> 01:13:03.807
Have you heard that Erich Loring

01:13:03.912 --> 01:13:07.211
has agreed to put together
a leadership team?

01:13:08.016 --> 01:13:10.314
Yeah, I heard some rumor about it.
What bullshit.

01:13:10.419 --> 01:13:15.721
Now I'm gonna have to spend a couple of
hours a week jawin' with Zymagen guys?

01:13:16.759 --> 01:13:17.885
No.

01:13:18.193 --> 01:13:22.129
No. No, you won't,
'cause I'm not putting you on the team.

01:13:22.564 --> 01:13:24.293
What'd you say?

01:13:24.566 --> 01:13:26.397
I really wanted to.

01:13:27.202 --> 01:13:29.966
You're not putting me on the team?
Is that what you said?

01:13:30.072 --> 01:13:32.836
What are you, some varsity track coach?

01:13:33.542 --> 01:13:38.980
They didn't buy our company 'cause
they like your lvy League charm, Jersey.

01:13:39.214 --> 01:13:41.011
It's me they wanted.

01:13:41.116 --> 01:13:44.847
You can't bench me.
It's against the laws of nature.

01:13:44.953 --> 01:13:48.980
You're still gonna be able
to prove that your theory is right.

01:13:49.091 --> 01:13:54.256
Yeah, but other scientists are gonna
evaluate my results, right? Not me.

01:13:54.363 --> 01:13:58.595
Everyone here reveres your science.

01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:03.831
This is about interpersonal issues.

01:14:04.573 --> 01:14:08.202
-Who put you up to this?
-The decision was mine.

01:14:10.412 --> 01:14:13.040
It's for the overall good of the program.

01:14:13.148 --> 01:14:15.878
"For the overall good of the program."

01:14:17.085 --> 01:14:19.553
Wow, John, you really got
the corporate lingo down good.

01:14:19.655 --> 01:14:22.249
What's next, "Acceptable loss?"

01:14:38.841 --> 01:14:39.899
No.

01:14:40.008 --> 01:14:41.600
Does anybody really know how to do this?

01:14:41.743 --> 01:14:43.301
Except for us.

01:14:44.513 --> 01:14:47.949
-But wait, who's going?
-It's John's turn still.

01:14:49.451 --> 01:14:50.713
Nice one.

01:14:52.287 --> 01:14:54.084
Okay. I'll get it.

01:15:00.629 --> 01:15:02.062
Nice one, Megs.

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:05.292
Hello? Marcus, hi.

01:15:06.201 --> 01:15:07.327
Oh, my God.

01:15:07.870 --> 01:15:09.804
Man. I almost got 'em down.

01:15:09.938 --> 01:15:13.135
You guys sit tight, okay?
Here, John, grab him.

01:15:13.275 --> 01:15:17.405
If there is anything we can do,
anything at all, will you call?

01:15:17.946 --> 01:15:21.279
Okay.
We love you guys so much.

01:15:22.551 --> 01:15:24.143
Okay, bye-bye.

01:15:26.321 --> 01:15:27.686
Aileen.

01:15:30.125 --> 01:15:32.116
That was Marcus Temple.

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:34.526
Lauren...

01:15:35.831 --> 01:15:37.093
She...

01:15:40.502 --> 01:15:43.232
He said she went in her sleep,
that it was peaceful.

01:15:43.338 --> 01:15:44.930
How old is she?

01:15:46.308 --> 01:15:48.208
How old was Lauren?

01:15:53.482 --> 01:15:55.643
Lauren was nine years old.

01:16:03.258 --> 01:16:04.782
Come here.

01:16:15.070 --> 01:16:18.904
That way, we can be certain
that we're developing the correct one.

01:16:19.174 --> 01:16:25.306
Forget certainty, and let's try and figure out
which enzyme has the better odds.

01:16:25.514 --> 01:16:28.142
If we develop only one enzyme,

01:16:29.618 --> 01:16:31.415
what would happen
if we guessed the wrong one?

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:36.514
Mr. Crowley, I've asked Kent
to set up a testing protocol

01:16:36.625 --> 01:16:38.820
to help us guess right.

01:16:39.561 --> 01:16:42.428
We'll do an exhaustive range of tests.

01:16:42.531 --> 01:16:46.262
I'm calling it
"The Mother of All Experiments."

01:16:48.236 --> 01:16:52.730
The four enzymes will be color-coded,
yellow, blue, green and magenta,

01:16:52.874 --> 01:16:54.933
and known only by those color codes

01:16:55.077 --> 01:16:58.274
so no researcher will know
which one he's testing.

01:16:58.413 --> 01:17:02.713
Only after we pick a winner,
the secret identity will be revealed.

01:17:09.558 --> 01:17:11.219
Come on, Megan!

01:17:22.938 --> 01:17:24.030
But I want to!

01:17:29.578 --> 01:17:32.138
-Just roll your wrist.
-I can't.

01:17:36.618 --> 01:17:38.279
It's okay. It's all right. Let's try another one.

01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:40.911
Okay. Let's try again. Ready?

01:17:43.158 --> 01:17:44.557
Ready?

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:46.821
One, two, three, go!

01:17:49.164 --> 01:17:51.564
-Big winner!
-Yay!

01:17:52.768 --> 01:17:56.101
Here you go, look at that. You got a penguin.

01:18:05.814 --> 01:18:07.782
Hey, Bob. Bob.

01:18:09.885 --> 01:18:11.477
How you doin'?

01:18:17.125 --> 01:18:19.184
I brought you some ribs.

01:18:19.995 --> 01:18:23.362
Not as good as the ones
from The Corner Saloon,

01:18:23.465 --> 01:18:25.490
but if you're hungry...

01:18:36.144 --> 01:18:37.839
What do you want?

01:18:40.816 --> 01:18:42.443
The results.

01:18:44.019 --> 01:18:45.884
"Mother of All Experiments."

01:18:46.021 --> 01:18:47.283
Well,

01:18:49.524 --> 01:18:51.617
which enzyme did they choose?

01:18:51.727 --> 01:18:55.288
The leadership team
spent the whole afternoon arguing.

01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:58.833
Two enzymes, coded yellow and green,
are ahead of the others,

01:18:58.934 --> 01:19:01.232
but it's too close to call.

01:19:01.369 --> 01:19:06.466
Tomorrow, we spend the day hashing it out
to decide which one to choose.

01:19:08.276 --> 01:19:11.905
Bob. I'm asking you to read this.

01:19:12.547 --> 01:19:15.983
I value your opinion
more than anyone else in the world.

01:19:16.084 --> 01:19:18.644
Well, maybe you should have valued
my opinion a little sooner,

01:19:18.754 --> 01:19:22.315
instead of playing hatchet man
for the bean counters.

01:19:23.425 --> 01:19:27.987
-Get the hell out of my lab.
-It's in your interest to know about this, Bob.

01:19:31.099 --> 01:19:32.498
Get out.

01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:35.229
-Wouldn't it benefit you...
-Get out.

01:19:59.661 --> 01:20:04.291
The green enzyme's the best.
Show 'em my analysis, they'll understand.

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:07.095
Hey, wait up, Bob.

01:20:08.103 --> 01:20:09.968
Is the green enzyme yours?

01:20:10.105 --> 01:20:14.041
I recognize patterns in the results.
I'd know my baby a mile away.

01:20:14.142 --> 01:20:16.610
-So the green one is yours?
-No.

01:20:17.145 --> 01:20:18.737
No, it's not.

01:20:21.483 --> 01:20:25.647
My theory is still the best,
but it's not ready for manufacture.

01:20:26.922 --> 01:20:30.085
Theirs is crude and uninspired,
but it's ready.

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:35.161
Bob, I don't even know the words
to say thank you.

01:20:36.164 --> 01:20:37.631
Don't bother.

01:20:39.801 --> 01:20:41.826
I didn't do it for you.

01:21:28.683 --> 01:21:30.048
Yes, it is!

01:21:32.854 --> 01:21:34.822
-Oh, my gosh. Do you see the kite up there?
-Yeah.

01:21:34.923 --> 01:21:36.049
That's so cool!

01:21:36.191 --> 01:21:37.852
Annie, careful!

01:21:38.493 --> 01:21:40.461
-Building a bastion.
-Right there. Yeah.

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:46.726
-Three!
-Okay!

01:21:46.835 --> 01:21:47.927
Dad, like... Ready?

01:21:48.036 --> 01:21:51.472
-Dad, you promised no more phone calls.
-I know. I know I did, but...

01:21:51.573 --> 01:21:52.597
What's in there?

01:21:52.707 --> 01:21:55.005
We can take turns burying the phone
when I get back.

01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:56.668
Okay! I'll start digging a hole.

01:21:56.778 --> 01:21:59.406
-You hold that for a sec.
-John Crowley.

01:21:59.915 --> 01:22:01.712
John, it's Kent Weber.

01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:05.013
Kent, hey. Did you get
my suggested protocol for the clinical trials?

01:22:06.354 --> 01:22:07.548
Yeah.

01:22:09.090 --> 01:22:11.149
You made some
pretty optimistic assumptions

01:22:11.259 --> 01:22:14.057
about where our enzyme supply will be.

01:22:14.596 --> 01:22:15.893
I see.

01:22:16.765 --> 01:22:21.293
Well, what do you think
that a more realistic...

01:22:21.403 --> 01:22:27.171
John, I'll give it to you straight.
The clinical trial will be for infants only.

01:22:28.476 --> 01:22:30.876
Infants need so much less enzyme,

01:22:30.979 --> 01:22:33.777
and, as you know,
our initial supply will be so limited.

01:22:34.249 --> 01:22:37.980
And the drug has much higher odds
of being effective

01:22:38.086 --> 01:22:40.646
with infants than with older children.

01:22:40.755 --> 01:22:44.191
We have to consult Erich on this.
We have to consult Erich.

01:22:44.759 --> 01:22:47.626
I already did. He confirmed the decision.
Infants only.

01:22:48.129 --> 01:22:51.223
I understand your personal reasons for...

01:22:54.002 --> 01:22:59.235
These decisions have to be
made objectively, rationally.

01:23:00.442 --> 01:23:02.569
I'm sorry. I...

01:23:04.245 --> 01:23:05.269
I really am.

01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:20.464
Hold it, pal.

01:26:23.978 --> 01:26:27.470
-Mr. Crowley, what are you doin' in here?
-I was just...

01:26:27.582 --> 01:26:31.211
-You're not authorized.
-No... I can explain everything.

01:26:31.319 --> 01:26:33.184
What's the matter, Chuck?
Is there a problem?

01:26:33.288 --> 01:26:36.746
Yeah, there's a problem.
I got Mr. Crowley in here without clearance.

01:26:36.858 --> 01:26:38.223
That's my fault, now.

01:26:38.326 --> 01:26:43.559
I got busy in the lab, I sent Jersey boy here
to get me a couple jugs of enzyme.

01:26:44.132 --> 01:26:45.429
Sorry.

01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:57.068
Thanks, Chuck.

01:27:03.484 --> 01:27:05.645
Thanks for saving my ass.

01:27:07.055 --> 01:27:09.080
It's really big of you,

01:27:09.190 --> 01:27:13.786
especially after what went down between us.

01:27:15.230 --> 01:27:18.529
You mean your ruthless,
cold-hearted betrayal?

01:27:21.803 --> 01:27:25.830
Yeah, well, when I thought about it
from your point of view...

01:27:26.574 --> 01:27:31.671
Shit, if it was my kids dying, I wouldn't
have hesitated to crush you like a bug.

01:27:46.261 --> 01:27:48.525
Do you remember when we first met,

01:27:48.663 --> 01:27:53.828
and you told me that
I should stop chasing miracles

01:27:53.935 --> 01:27:56.836
and should go home and enjoy my kids,

01:27:58.206 --> 01:28:00.367
while they're still here?

01:28:05.213 --> 01:28:07.704
-Yeah.
-I made the wrong choice.

01:28:23.665 --> 01:28:27.624
-Jersey, you know what a sibling study is?
-No.

01:28:27.735 --> 01:28:32.604
It's a drug trial with just two patients
with the same genetic inheritance.

01:28:33.841 --> 01:28:37.607
Siblings, with the same disease.

01:28:37.712 --> 01:28:39.441
Megs and Patrick.

01:28:41.449 --> 01:28:44.714
Well, would Zymagen
go for something like this?

01:28:45.787 --> 01:28:48.585
There's real research value in it.

01:28:48.756 --> 01:28:52.021
And with just two patients,
it wouldn't take much enzyme.

01:28:52.126 --> 01:28:55.095
But Webber would have to sign off on it.

01:28:56.264 --> 01:28:59.756
Well, let's not tell him
till we've got our ducks in a row.

01:28:59.901 --> 01:29:05.203
I could draw up a protocol and see if I can
find a hospital willing to administer it.

01:29:06.074 --> 01:29:09.874
-Bob.
-Well, don't get your hopes up, kid.

01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:13.943
It's a Hail Mary.

01:29:46.214 --> 01:29:47.841
Ducks in a row.

01:29:50.818 --> 01:29:53.184
"Stonehill, careful review, protocol,
Sibling Trial,146,

01:29:53.287 --> 01:29:54.720
"are pleased to inform you Megan Crowley
and Patrick

01:29:54.822 --> 01:29:56.346
"have been accepted into the trial!"

01:29:56.524 --> 01:29:59.220
-I just got it.
-Quack, quack, quack.

01:29:59.327 --> 01:30:00.624
Have you talked to him yet?

01:30:00.728 --> 01:30:04.960
No. I did the science. You make the sale.

01:30:06.868 --> 01:30:08.267
Thank you.

01:30:08.736 --> 01:30:10.601
-Good luck.
-Right.

01:30:17.378 --> 01:30:19.278
-Does he have about five?
-He does, yeah.

01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:21.848
-Thanks.
-No problem, Mr. Crowley.

01:30:23.751 --> 01:30:25.719
Hey, Kent? Knock-knock.

01:30:27.922 --> 01:30:29.389
Got a minute?

01:30:31.025 --> 01:30:32.287
Kent?

01:30:33.594 --> 01:30:37.792
-Do you have any idea what you've done?
-Excuse me?

01:30:37.899 --> 01:30:40.390
We got a call this morning
from Portland Rose Hospital,

01:30:40.501 --> 01:30:42.662
about sending them enzyme for your kids?

01:30:42.770 --> 01:30:45.295
Right. Yeah, I know.
That's what I'm here to talk to you about.

01:30:45.406 --> 01:30:49.274
You and Stonehill set this up behind
my back. Now you come to me.

01:30:49.377 --> 01:30:51.277
It's all tentative.

01:30:51.379 --> 01:30:55.475
You want this company
to sponsor a drug study,

01:30:55.583 --> 01:30:59.917
for two children whose father
is an executive of this company?

01:31:00.021 --> 01:31:02.012
Have you never heard the term
"conflict of interest?"

01:31:02.123 --> 01:31:03.283
It has nothing to do with a...

01:31:03.391 --> 01:31:05.188
Do you know what the FDA would do
if they found out?

01:31:05.293 --> 01:31:08.490
There is strong scientific justification
for this study.

01:31:08.596 --> 01:31:10.461
There is great research value.

01:31:10.565 --> 01:31:13.693
I'm a doctor, John.
I know the research value!

01:31:14.569 --> 01:31:17.800
But you guys just can't go off half-cocked
without consulting us!

01:31:17.905 --> 01:31:19.873
And I'm sure that if we just go
and talk to Erich, we can...

01:31:19.974 --> 01:31:21.373
Erich already knows.

01:31:21.476 --> 01:31:25.310
-He's furious about being blindsided.
-I didn't try to blindside anyone.

01:31:25.413 --> 01:31:29.008
This is the reason
why we have a reporting structure,

01:31:29.116 --> 01:31:32.950
why we have established procedure,
why there is protocol.

01:31:34.755 --> 01:31:37.315
You heartless, bloodless machine.

01:31:37.425 --> 01:31:40.986
You just have to fight me
every step of the way! Don't you?

01:31:41.095 --> 01:31:44.963
You just hated it when I brought
the kids with Pompe to the doorstep!

01:31:45.066 --> 01:31:48.968
You weren't thinking about those kids when
you put your children into that program

01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:53.973
and jeopardized a decade's worth of
research investment made by this company!

01:31:54.075 --> 01:31:56.703
This is not about a return on an investment!

01:31:56.811 --> 01:31:58.540
It's about kids,

01:31:59.447 --> 01:32:02.143
kids with names, dreams,

01:32:03.818 --> 01:32:05.945
families that love them.

01:32:06.587 --> 01:32:10.819
You've jeopardized your chances
of ever getting your kids treated.

01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:42.585
I'm not arguing science with you!

01:32:43.558 --> 01:32:46.152
On every level!
On every level, you've stood...

01:33:01.976 --> 01:33:05.275
I was just drafting a letter of apology
for senior management,

01:33:05.379 --> 01:33:08.314
but I guess we're past that point.

01:33:10.084 --> 01:33:14.180
I just spoke to Erich,
and we are terminating your employment.

01:33:15.856 --> 01:33:17.790
Okay, I'll pack up my stuff.

01:33:17.892 --> 01:33:19.917
Just one thing, John.

01:33:20.027 --> 01:33:24.896
I may well be
a tight-ass pencil-pushing company man,

01:33:24.999 --> 01:33:27.297
but I resent being called heartless.

01:33:27.401 --> 01:33:29.801
-Look...
-Just let me finish.

01:33:30.771 --> 01:33:33.103
The reason we're terminating
your employment,

01:33:33.207 --> 01:33:36.176
is to eliminate the conflict of interest.

01:33:36.877 --> 01:33:41.280
This strategy was brought to my attention
by our colleague, Dr. Stonehill,

01:33:41.382 --> 01:33:43.475
in rather crude terms.

01:33:45.119 --> 01:33:48.247
This will allow the sibling trial to proceed

01:33:49.056 --> 01:33:51.650
for its purely scientific value.

01:33:55.963 --> 01:33:59.228
Have your desk cleared out
by the end of the day.

01:34:00.201 --> 01:34:02.362
Kent, what's with the...

01:34:05.439 --> 01:34:10.001
I wanted to make sure you didn't
punch me out before I could tell you.

01:34:11.278 --> 01:34:12.540
Well,

01:34:15.049 --> 01:34:18.382
-thank you very much for firing me.
-My pleasure.

01:34:18.919 --> 01:34:21.217
-I never liked you.
-Likewise.

01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:27.057
Hey, you guys,
bring anything you want extra...

01:34:27.161 --> 01:34:28.185
-Mom! Mom!
-What?

01:34:28.295 --> 01:34:30.058
-Can I bring the bow and arrow?
-Yes, yes.

01:34:33.801 --> 01:34:35.063
Hey!

01:34:40.841 --> 01:34:42.433
John, what...

01:34:43.411 --> 01:34:44.571
What?

01:34:45.579 --> 01:34:50.983
We have a usable enzyme
that's ready for clinical trials.

01:34:53.921 --> 01:34:55.821
When? When will it be ready?

01:34:55.923 --> 01:34:59.723
Megs and Patrick start their infusions
before the end of this month.

01:34:59.827 --> 01:35:01.954
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

01:35:03.297 --> 01:35:04.764
Oh, my God.

01:35:06.967 --> 01:35:08.161
John.

01:35:08.836 --> 01:35:10.861
Hey, John, Daddy's here.

01:35:10.971 --> 01:35:13.098
-Oh, hi, guys.
-Hey, Dad.

01:35:13.974 --> 01:35:15.737
Why is Mommy sad?

01:35:16.811 --> 01:35:19.609
Not sad, baby, so happy.

01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:24.281
So happy.

01:35:24.385 --> 01:35:26.285
Why is Mommy being so weird?

01:35:26.387 --> 01:35:29.049
Well, it's because
we got the special medicine

01:35:29.156 --> 01:35:32.592
for you, Megs, and for you, Patrick,
and you're gonna get it really soon.

01:35:32.693 --> 01:35:34.126
That's great!

01:35:49.710 --> 01:35:52.178
So, who wants to push the button?

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:08.524
Megs, Patrick, you ready?

01:36:27.715 --> 01:36:29.979
When will we know if it's working?

01:36:30.084 --> 01:36:32.143
It'll be a while, honey.

01:36:32.253 --> 01:36:33.845
It's not pink.

01:37:13.427 --> 01:37:16.760
Excuse me?
Your Uncle Bobby is here.

01:37:18.432 --> 01:37:19.922
I don't know.

01:37:27.007 --> 01:37:29.635
-You can go back if you like.
-Okay.

01:37:35.082 --> 01:37:37.141
-John.
-Uncle Bobby.

01:37:38.319 --> 01:37:41.447
They wouldn't let me in unless I was family.

01:37:44.191 --> 01:37:47.251
-Some things for the kids.
-Thanks.

01:37:47.361 --> 01:37:48.953
Sleeping, huh?

01:37:54.335 --> 01:37:56.326
Hey, thanks for coming.

01:38:00.307 --> 01:38:03.401
I'm a scientist. Gotta track the experiment.

01:38:12.853 --> 01:38:16.311
I wish your enzyme was the one
that passed the test.

01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:22.285
But the one the kids are getting,
it's the right one, right? I mean...

01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:24.930
It's gonna help them.

01:38:29.403 --> 01:38:31.928
Yeah, you guys have done
everything humanly possible.

01:38:32.039 --> 01:38:36.271
We just have to see what the tests show.

01:38:39.013 --> 01:38:41.914
You and I have had our differences,

01:38:42.016 --> 01:38:45.508
and I just want you to know something.

01:38:46.553 --> 01:38:48.111
I want you to know that...

01:38:48.222 --> 01:38:50.019
-Yeah.
-Don't interrupt.

01:38:50.124 --> 01:38:51.352
Okay.

01:38:53.027 --> 01:38:57.054
I want you to know
that I appreciate everything

01:38:57.164 --> 01:38:59.064
that you've done for Megs and Patrick,

01:38:59.166 --> 01:39:02.761
and I'm never gonna forget it
for the rest of my life.

01:39:06.473 --> 01:39:08.441
Not gonna kiss me, is he?

01:39:08.542 --> 01:39:10.442
I will restrain him.

01:39:11.879 --> 01:39:13.540
Don't tempt me.

01:39:16.884 --> 01:39:20.684
Daddy loves SpongeBob,
Daddy loves SpongeBob.

01:39:33.367 --> 01:39:35.597
-Stop!
-Daddy loves SpongeBob.

01:39:35.703 --> 01:39:37.068
Guys?

01:39:38.672 --> 01:39:40.367
What's going on?

01:39:41.775 --> 01:39:43.504
What's so funny?

01:39:44.945 --> 01:39:47.072
What are you laughing at?

01:39:49.116 --> 01:39:51.243
What are you laughing at?

01:39:52.119 --> 01:39:53.416
Sugar.

01:39:57.124 --> 01:39:58.921
It's a sugar high.

01:40:00.027 --> 01:40:03.428
The enzyme's breaking down
the sugar in their muscles.

01:40:03.530 --> 01:40:06.021
-The medicine's working?
-Yeah.

01:40:07.568 --> 01:40:08.762
John.

01:40:17.811 --> 01:40:19.005
Megs!

01:40:19.413 --> 01:40:20.505
Hi.

01:40:39.199 --> 01:40:41.827
-John, drive safe!
-Enjoy the ride!

01:40:44.271 --> 01:40:45.829
Rock and roll!

01:40:47.307 --> 01:40:50.367
-Bye! Have fun.
-Bye!

01:41:29.049 --> 01:41:30.482
Yes!

01:41:31.919 --> 01:41:34.649
Yeah! Yeah!
