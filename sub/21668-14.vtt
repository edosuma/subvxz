00:01.413 --> 00:03.344
(Male announcer) Previously
on  Hell's Kitchen...

00:03.382 --> 00:04.649
All right, folks, final five.

00:04.650 --> 00:07.282
(Announcer) The final five celebrated.

00:07.283 --> 00:09.016
And in their first individual challenge,

00:09.017 --> 00:10.482
will's meatloaf...

00:10.483 --> 00:11.948
Absolutely awesome.

00:11.949 --> 00:13.547
(Announcer) Beat out Elise's
eggplant parmesan...

00:13.548 --> 00:14.981
Very pretty. By a single point.

00:14.982 --> 00:16.081
(Gordon)   great job.

00:16.082 --> 00:17.283
(Announcer) Then chef Ramsay revealed

00:17.284 --> 00:19.282
a surprising dinner service test.

00:19.283 --> 00:22.315
There will be another team...

00:22.316 --> 00:23.315
Whoo!

00:23.316 --> 00:24.915
Inside the red kitchen.

00:24.916 --> 00:26.547
Did you guys bring   your sunglasses?

00:26.548 --> 00:27.549
'Cause we're about to shine.

00:27.550 --> 00:29.115
I just brought body bags.

00:29.116 --> 00:30.914
(Announcer) But while
planning their team menu...

00:30.915 --> 00:32.314
It's not all what you want.

00:32.314 --> 00:33.947
(Announcer) Elise tried to take over.

00:33.948 --> 00:35.714
I'm not [Bleep] cooking will's menu.

00:35.715 --> 00:36.716
I'm not [Bleep]... shut up!

00:36.717 --> 00:38.882
Yo, I'm sick of this!

00:38.883 --> 00:40.216
You had to have been the problem.
I'm not the problem 'cause I'm still here.

00:40.217 --> 00:41.882
(Announcer) Then at dinner...

00:41.883 --> 00:43.014
How long, Tenille?

00:43.015 --> 00:44.014
(Announcer) Although the returning chefs

00:44.015 --> 00:45.016
were a little rusty.

00:45.017 --> 00:46.882
It's like canned tuna. Come on.

00:46.883 --> 00:48.582
Yes, chef. Is that medium well?

00:48.583 --> 00:49.681
No, chef. [Raspberries]

00:49.682 --> 00:50.683
(Announcer) And...

00:50.684 --> 00:52.715
I need the garnish first, Jennifer!

00:52.716 --> 00:54.183
(Announcer) Jennifer had a
few stumbles on garnish.

00:54.184 --> 00:55.948
This is stone cold!

00:55.949 --> 00:58.448
(Announcer) But all in all,
both teams had strong services.

00:58.449 --> 00:59.515
What a night!

00:59.516 --> 01:00.883
(Announcer) The winning team was...

01:00.884 --> 01:02.382
Current chefs.

01:02.383 --> 01:04.346
(Announcer) The final five
passed a major test but...

01:04.348 --> 01:05.647
I need you to give me the name

01:05.648 --> 01:07.116
of two that should be up for elimination.

01:07.117 --> 01:08.148
What?

01:08.149 --> 01:09.214
(Announcer) During deliberation,

01:09.215 --> 01:10.481
Elise put up a fight.

01:10.482 --> 01:12.281
You want to put me up because you're scared

01:12.282 --> 01:13.283
I will beat you.

01:13.284 --> 01:15.382
You better watch it! Yeah, you are.

01:15.383 --> 01:17.314
(Announcer) And Jennifer let out a secret.

01:17.315 --> 01:19.116
I've had a huge crush on you from day one.

01:19.117 --> 01:21.915
I'm so embarrassed right now.

01:21.916 --> 01:23.582
Gym socks loves me!

01:23.583 --> 01:25.615
(Announcer) When the dust
settled, they chose...

01:25.616 --> 01:27.382
Jennifer, chef. And...

01:27.383 --> 01:28.882
Me, chef. Excuse me?

01:28.883 --> 01:29.948
Myself.

01:29.949 --> 01:30.949
(Announcer) For elimination.

01:30.950 --> 01:33.348
But chef Ramsay decided that...

01:33.349 --> 01:35.915
No one performed in such a way

01:35.916 --> 01:38.782
that they deserve to
leave this competition.

Get out of here. Well done.

02:44.217 --> 02:45.982
Yes, chef. Good night, chef.

02:45.983 --> 02:47.149
No one went home tonight.

02:47.150 --> 02:48.948
I'm still in Hell's Kitchen.

02:48.949 --> 02:51.215
So I'm very happy right now.

02:51.216 --> 02:55.082
Oh, my God, I cannot believe
I just said my good-byes.

02:55.083 --> 02:57.048

02:57.049 --> 03:01.315
Jenn and Pauly sitting in a tree.

03:01.316 --> 03:03.116
I've had a huge crush on you from day one.

03:03.117 --> 03:04.948
Aww, you're so cute.

03:04.949 --> 03:07.482
I think it's cute. I think it's funny.

03:07.483 --> 03:10.248
I mean, it would never work
'cause she's from Boston.

03:10.249 --> 03:13.715
My soul mate's definitely
gonna be a jets fan, sorry.

03:13.716 --> 03:14.983
I am, like, so embarrassed right now.

03:14.984 --> 03:17.315
Jenn, don't be embarrassed.

03:17.316 --> 03:18.682
Look at you blushing.

03:18.683 --> 03:20.948
I didn't want to go home
with him not knowing,

03:20.949 --> 03:23.482
and now he knows, and I'm still here.

03:23.483 --> 03:25.715
That's all I'm gonna say. Wow.

03:25.716 --> 03:26.948
Jenn.

03:26.949 --> 03:29.848
[Laughter]

03:29.849 --> 03:31.948
Please, Paul, do not tease me.

03:31.949 --> 03:34.815
[Laughs]

03:34.816 --> 03:37.282
(Announcer) At dinner service, formance

03:37.283 --> 03:39.315
the confident black team
seems ready for whatever

03:39.316 --> 03:42.815
chef Ramsay might throw at them.

03:42.816 --> 03:43.983
Okay, good morning.

03:43.984 --> 03:45.548
(All) Morning, chef.

03:45.549 --> 03:47.948
Listen carefully, chefs become heroes

03:47.949 --> 03:50.115
when they're able   to take an ingredient

03:50.116 --> 03:52.449
and turn it into something
with incredible value, right?

03:52.450 --> 03:53.848
Yes, chef.

03:53.849 --> 03:57.482
First, you start with a
top-quality ingredient.

03:57.483 --> 03:58.849
If you are lucky enough

03:58.850 --> 04:01.782
to have a stunning, wild

04:01.783 --> 04:03.782
white Alaskan salmon

04:03.783 --> 04:05.849
fall from the sky, can you imagine?

04:08.349 --> 04:10.648
Holy [Bleep].

04:10.649 --> 04:13.248
Scared the [Bleep] outta me.

04:13.249 --> 04:14.283
I thought I was gonna poop myself.

04:14.284 --> 04:15.815
Oh, my God.

04:15.816 --> 04:17.048
[Laughter]

04:17.048 --> 04:19.048
Chef Ramsay can make
fish fall from the sky.

04:19.048 --> 04:20.083
That's all I'm gonna say.

04:20.084 --> 04:22.415
[Laughter]

04:22.416 --> 04:23.948
[Sound of object falling]

04:23.949 --> 04:26.048
[Crash]

04:26.049 --> 04:27.415
Now, this salmon

04:27.416 --> 04:30.748
costs $450.

04:30.749 --> 04:32.548
From this one salmon, 30 portions.

04:32.549 --> 04:35.082
And I could make   a stunning dish

04:35.083 --> 04:37.682
like this.

04:37.683 --> 04:40.016
A dish like that at a minimum
of $40 per portion

04:40.017 --> 04:44.582
times 30, that is a profit   of $750.

04:44.583 --> 04:46.483
This plus this plus this, equals this.

04:46.484 --> 04:48.582
Hold on!

04:48.583 --> 04:49.916
So for today's challenge,

04:49.917 --> 04:51.882
add your creativity

04:51.883 --> 04:54.215
and turn your salmon

04:54.216 --> 04:57.082
into the most profitable dish ever.

04:57.083 --> 04:59.382
Clearly the person   with the highest price

04:59.383 --> 05:00.849
will win the challenge.

05:00.850 --> 05:03.748
30 minutes starts from now.

05:03.749 --> 05:04.781
Off you go. Get out of my way.

05:04.782 --> 05:05.781
(Announcer) In the profit challenge,

05:05.782 --> 05:07.116
the chefs have 30 minutes

05:07.117 --> 05:09.815
to turn their portion of
rare Alaskan white salmon

05:09.816 --> 05:12.448
into an expensive entree.

05:12.449 --> 05:14.016
The chef whose dish
garners the highest price

05:14.017 --> 05:16.015
wins the challenge.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.183
Who took my grater?

05:17.184 --> 05:18.648
Where is it?

05:18.649 --> 05:20.383
It's right here in front
of my face; Never mind.

05:20.384 --> 05:23.048
I just gotta keep shining
in the individual challenge

05:23.049 --> 05:24.916
to prove to chef today
that I'm worthy of being

05:24.917 --> 05:26.214
in this competition.

05:26.215 --> 05:27.947
I've never worked with white salmon before,

05:27.948 --> 05:29.149
but I can cook fish.

05:29.150 --> 05:30.515
[Bleep].

05:30.516 --> 05:31.749
(Announcer) While Elise and the other chefs

05:31.750 --> 05:34.015
begin to work on their dishes, Jennifer...

05:34.016 --> 05:35.515
One piece of salmon.

05:35.516 --> 05:37.481
God, I think I'm thinking too much.

05:37.482 --> 05:39.516
(Announcer) Appears to be
stuck in the planning phase.

05:39.517 --> 05:42.048
Oh, my God, how am I gonna cook this?

05:42.049 --> 05:43.314
Am I supposed to leave the skin on it?

05:43.315 --> 05:44.483
I've just never worked with it before.

05:44.484 --> 05:46.115
Who stole my salt?

05:46.116 --> 05:47.416
I did. I moved it to the middle.

05:47.417 --> 05:50.482
Jenn's poaching the fish with the skin off.

05:50.483 --> 05:52.815
Yeah, you're on the wrong track.

05:52.816 --> 05:54.149
(Gordon)   last ten minutes.
Don't plate too early.

05:54.150 --> 05:55.182
Oh, my God.

05:55.183 --> 05:57.415
My strategy was I kept it simple.

05:57.416 --> 05:58.948
Just a little truffle oil in there

05:58.949 --> 06:00.383
to accent the fact that this

06:00.384 --> 06:02.315
is a very expensive piece of fish.

06:02.316 --> 06:04.081
Behind you, hot, hot, hot.   five.

06:04.082 --> 06:05.583
God, I feel like I need something else.

06:05.584 --> 06:07.182
Four. Coming, coming, coming.

06:07.183 --> 06:09.748
Three.   two.

06:09.749 --> 06:10.748
One.

06:10.749 --> 06:12.616
And serve.

06:15.149 --> 06:16.515
Okay, great.

06:16.516 --> 06:19.082
I've invited three very special judges.

06:19.083 --> 06:21.348
They work in some   of
the finest restaurants

06:21.349 --> 06:22.982
anywhere in the country,

06:22.983 --> 06:26.448
and they know what dishes
attract top dollar.

06:26.449 --> 06:28.548
Our first judge

06:28.549 --> 06:30.148
is the general manager

06:30.149 --> 06:31.515
of Nobu L.A.

06:31.516 --> 06:32.515
Oh, yeah.

06:32.516 --> 06:34.748
Please welcome   Justin Wyborn.

06:34.749 --> 06:36.282
Good to see you. Welcome back.

06:36.283 --> 06:37.516
Thank you. Thank you very much.

06:37.517 --> 06:40.848
Our next judge   is the general manager

06:40.849 --> 06:42.616
of Providence, a two
Michelin   star restaurant.

06:42.617 --> 06:44.482
Please welcome   Donato Poto.

06:44.483 --> 06:45.781
Thank you so much   for coming.

06:45.782 --> 06:46.883
Thank you so much.

06:46.884 --> 06:48.448
And our third and final judge

06:48.449 --> 06:51.982
is the maitre d' of the famed
Beverly Hills restaurant

06:51.983 --> 06:53.082
Mr. Chow.

06:53.083 --> 06:54.183
Please welcome   Chris Denton.

06:54.184 --> 06:56.248
Hi, chef. How are you?

06:56.249 --> 06:58.214
Good to see you. Thank you so much.

06:58.215 --> 06:59.314
I'm kinda blown away.

06:59.315 --> 07:00.749
Everybody's at the top of their field.

07:00.750 --> 07:03.382
It's awesome to be able
to show these judges

07:03.383 --> 07:04.383
what I'm about.

07:04.384 --> 07:06.715
So after tasting the dish,

07:06.716 --> 07:08.116
I'm gonna need you   to tell me

07:08.117 --> 07:09.616
what price   you would expect

07:09.617 --> 07:11.315
to find that on a menu.

07:11.316 --> 07:12.414
And we'll come up with an average,

07:12.415 --> 07:13.749
split between all three of you.

07:13.750 --> 07:15.848
The person with   the highest average

07:15.849 --> 07:17.081
will win the challenge.

07:17.082 --> 07:18.183
Okay, great.

07:18.184 --> 07:19.282
Will, please.

07:19.283 --> 07:20.881
I'm confident in the way my food tastes.

07:20.882 --> 07:22.847
I'm confident in the way my food is cooked.

07:22.848 --> 07:24.514
I don't wanna just win. I wanna dominate.

07:24.515 --> 07:25.783
What I'm presenting you today

07:25.784 --> 07:28.815
is a Pan-roasted wild
Alaskan white king salmon

07:28.816 --> 07:32.348
in a tomato and garlic stew.

07:32.349 --> 07:34.283
I think the skin could
be a little crispier.

07:34.284 --> 07:36.082
But the temperature's great.

07:36.083 --> 07:37.449
Dish is solid.

07:39.516 --> 07:42.482
That's just a little too salty for me

07:42.483 --> 07:43.681
with the potatoes,

07:43.682 --> 07:44.916
but everything else seems pretty decent.

07:44.917 --> 07:46.715
Okay. You've done a good job

07:46.716 --> 07:48.782
with the other things not
overwhelming the fish.

07:48.783 --> 07:50.347
Okay, great, Justin, let's
start off with you.

07:50.348 --> 07:51.647
How would you price   that dish?

07:51.648 --> 07:53.616
It was good, and I'd
probably say about $30.

07:53.617 --> 07:54.615
$30.

07:54.616 --> 07:56.982
I would give this dish $28.

07:56.983 --> 07:58.115
$28.

07:58.116 --> 07:59.516
I would say probably 28 too.

07:59.517 --> 08:00.982
Thank you very much.

08:00.983 --> 08:02.283
So, will, our judges have
given   you an average price

08:02.284 --> 08:05.082
of $28.67.

08:05.083 --> 08:06.549
Elise next, please. Thank you.

08:06.550 --> 08:08.382
I'm next after will,

08:08.383 --> 08:10.648
and my heart is about to
beat out of my chest.

08:10.649 --> 08:11.981
But my salmon is cooked perfectly.

08:11.982 --> 08:13.747
My macaroni and cheese tastes awesome.

08:13.748 --> 08:15.416
There's no reason why
they shouldn't like it.

08:15.417 --> 08:18.382
Visually not very good, I'm afraid.

08:18.383 --> 08:19.981
(Gordon)   I've never seen it
sliced like that before.

08:19.982 --> 08:21.114
What was the reason   behind that?

08:21.115 --> 08:22.483
I sliced it to show the middle

08:22.484 --> 08:24.315
'cause I think it was pretty.

08:24.316 --> 08:27.582
Pretty? It looks like a dog's chewed it.

08:27.583 --> 08:28.816
Why pasta with the fish?

08:28.817 --> 08:30.615
That's what I wanted to go with.

08:30.616 --> 08:32.183
They're looking at me
like I done lost my mind,

08:32.183 --> 08:35.615
putting macaroni and cheese
on a plate with salmon.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.414
After tasting the pasta,

08:37.416 --> 08:41.515
you really don't notice the fish so much.

08:41.515 --> 08:44.848
Chris, price. 27, I think.

08:44.849 --> 08:47.182
I will give that salmon 22.

08:47.183 --> 08:48.815
24.

08:48.816 --> 08:50.248
Wow, okay.

08:50.249 --> 08:53.816
The average price, $24.33.

08:55.249 --> 08:56.249
Okay, rock and roll.

08:56.250 --> 08:57.715
Tommy, let's go.

08:57.716 --> 08:59.615
I'm pretty excited about this.

08:59.616 --> 09:00.915
I Hope you are.

09:00.916 --> 09:02.483
So I have a white Alaskan
salmon pan-roasted,

09:02.484 --> 09:04.115
and there's a very light

09:04.116 --> 09:07.315
pomegranate a l'anis beurre blanc.

09:07.316 --> 09:09.348
I like the seasoning   that you've used.

09:09.349 --> 09:11.015
But the fish is a little bit dry.

09:11.016 --> 09:13.049
You know, that's a little
disappointing for me.

09:13.050 --> 09:14.415
Damn.   sorry.

09:14.416 --> 09:16.448
I want to like this dish more than I did.

09:16.449 --> 09:18.615
Unfortunately   it looks a little better

09:18.616 --> 09:22.048
than it actually was gonna taste.

09:22.049 --> 09:24.648
Justin, price-wise, what
would you give that?

09:24.649 --> 09:26.948
Um, I'd probably go, like,
26 for that actually.

09:26.949 --> 09:28.482
$26. Yeah.

09:28.483 --> 09:29.982
No more than 25.

09:29.983 --> 09:31.948
25, thank you.

09:31.949 --> 09:35.082
I would say probably 25.

09:35.083 --> 09:36.081
Our esteemed judges

09:36.082 --> 09:37.083
have given you an average price

09:37.084 --> 09:39.282
of $25.33.

09:39.283 --> 09:40.515
Crap.

09:40.516 --> 09:42.248
That's a big kick in the [Bleep].

09:42.249 --> 09:43.348
That's rough.

09:43.349 --> 09:45.215
Paul, let's go, please.

09:45.216 --> 09:46.915
Yes, chef.

09:46.916 --> 09:48.116
Oh, and now Paul coming up to bat

09:48.117 --> 09:50.382
with his awesome white salmon dish

09:50.383 --> 09:52.682
in romanesco.

09:52.683 --> 09:53.681
The more I eat,

09:53.682 --> 09:55.081
the happier you're gonna be.

09:55.082 --> 09:56.581
The dish is very nice. Thank you.

09:56.582 --> 09:57.981
Visually, I think it looks quite nice.

09:57.982 --> 09:59.681
It's quite good. It's cooked right.

09:59.682 --> 10:01.149
And I liked it.   nice, good.

10:01.150 --> 10:02.649
It is good, no doubt about it.

10:02.650 --> 10:05.082
He's gonna slaughter us all.

10:05.083 --> 10:06.248
I don't know.

10:06.249 --> 10:07.315
Donato?

10:07.316 --> 10:09.082
I would give 29.

10:09.083 --> 10:10.882
29.   yes.

10:10.883 --> 10:11.883
Let's just stay

10:11.884 --> 10:12.915
with 29 also.

10:12.916 --> 10:14.748
Wow, Chris, please.

10:14.749 --> 10:15.815
Price?

10:15.816 --> 10:18.415
The price, I would say 31.

10:18.416 --> 10:19.483
31 for that one.

10:19.484 --> 10:20.915
$29.67.

10:20.916 --> 10:21.948
Good job.

10:21.949 --> 10:23.782
Wow. Excellent.

10:23.783 --> 10:25.147
Well done. Thank you, chef.

10:25.148 --> 10:26.147
Good job, Pauly.  
Thank you, chef.

10:26.148 --> 10:27.416
Good job. Thank you.

10:27.417 --> 10:29.148
[Sound of bat hitting baseball]

10:33.649 --> 10:35.315
has him out in front.

10:35.316 --> 10:37.182
One more chef. Jennifer, please.

10:37.183 --> 10:39.283
(Announcer) And now his
not-so-secret admirer Jennifer

10:39.284 --> 10:42.282
is the last chef remaining.

10:42.283 --> 10:44.216
Oh, my God, it's coming down
to me and my crush Paul.

10:44.217 --> 10:45.448
Aye-yi-yi.

10:45.449 --> 10:48.015
I did a poached salmon

10:48.016 --> 10:49.482
with an oyster broth.

10:49.483 --> 10:52.415
Poaching a white Alaskan king salmon?

10:52.416 --> 10:53.714
I know, I wanted to try
something different.

10:53.715 --> 10:54.716
I saw everyone else searing.

10:54.717 --> 10:57.282
That was a ballsy move by Jenn,

10:57.283 --> 10:58.647
especially when you have one go

10:58.648 --> 10:59.783
and an expensive ingredient.

11:03.449 --> 11:05.916
I'm very surprised, it tastes
much better than it looked.

11:05.917 --> 11:08.715
I like it.

11:08.716 --> 11:11.015
The presentation   wasn't terrific,

11:11.016 --> 11:12.383
but the flavor is good

11:12.384 --> 11:14.882
and I respect your gamble. Quite good.

11:14.883 --> 11:16.183
Donato, how much   would you put that

11:16.184 --> 11:17.715
at Providence?

11:17.716 --> 11:19.915
29 actually. $29.

11:19.916 --> 11:21.348
Probably 29.   wow.

11:21.349 --> 11:23.316
(Announcer) For Jennifer
to win the challenge,

11:23.317 --> 11:25.682
she needs a price of at least $32

11:25.683 --> 11:27.748
from the last judge.

11:27.749 --> 11:28.916
Justin could change the game.

11:28.917 --> 11:30.215
Yeah, um,

11:30.216 --> 11:31.814
the fish was cooked well.
It did have flavor.

11:31.815 --> 11:33.516
There was definitely great flavor in there.

11:33.517 --> 11:35.782
It's a tough call.

11:35.783 --> 11:37.748
Um, I'd probably say...

11:37.749 --> 11:40.749
[Suspenseful music]

11:45.290 --> 11:46.521
(Announcer) In today's profit challenge,

Paul is currently leading with a dish

11:48.491 --> 11:52.490

an average price of $29.67.

11:58.490 --> 11:59.889
from the final judge.

11:59.890 --> 12:02.122
Um, the fish was cooked well.

12:02.123 --> 12:04.389
Um, I'd probably say, what,

12:04.390 --> 12:06.190
27. 27, yeah.

12:08.790 --> 12:09.790
Jennifer, the average price for your dish

12:09.791 --> 12:13.722
is $28.33.

12:13.723 --> 12:14.722
Damn it.

12:14.723 --> 12:16.689
Paul beats will by a dollar.

12:16.690 --> 12:18.890
And you win the challenge.
Congratulations, well done.

12:18.891 --> 12:20.022
Great work.

12:22.090 --> 12:23.255
Judges, as always... thank you, chef.

12:23.256 --> 12:24.255
Great comments.

12:24.256 --> 12:25.255
Thank you.   thank you.

12:25.256 --> 12:26.257
Best wishes.

12:26.258 --> 12:28.389
Wow.

12:28.390 --> 12:30.822
Okay, Paul, today you're joining me...

12:30.823 --> 12:31.989
Ooh.

12:31.990 --> 12:33.922
On a phenomenal tour of L.A.

12:33.923 --> 12:37.789
In our own private   helicopter.

12:37.790 --> 12:39.122
Awesome!

12:39.123 --> 12:40.890
I'm stoked to be going on a helicopter,

12:40.891 --> 12:42.489
hanging out with chef.

12:42.490 --> 12:44.690
You'll have an amazing lunch
at the water grill.

12:44.691 --> 12:46.056
What?

12:46.057 --> 12:47.523
One of L.A.'s finest   seafood restaurants.

12:47.524 --> 12:49.489
I picked the right day to win.

12:49.490 --> 12:51.257
We can't have this experience
just you and I on our own.

12:51.258 --> 12:53.589
Who you gonna take?   is it Jennifer?

12:53.590 --> 12:56.589
I would love one-on-one time
with Paul and a little lunch.

12:56.590 --> 12:58.789
Please pick me.

12:58.790 --> 12:59.856
Um...

12:59.857 --> 13:01.322
I don't wanna take Elise

13:01.323 --> 13:02.757
'cause I feel like I'd be very tempted

13:02.758 --> 13:04.789
to push Elise out of the helicopter.

13:04.790 --> 13:06.189
Tommy, come on.

13:06.190 --> 13:07.189
Yeah? Yeah.

13:07.190 --> 13:08.656
Oh, yeah, boy.

13:08.657 --> 13:09.955
All right, guys,   hurry up and get ready.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.190
We're taking off quite
literally in 15 minutes.

13:11.191 --> 13:12.322
Quick.

13:12.323 --> 13:13.421
I did not think Paul was gonna choose me

13:13.422 --> 13:14.621
for a helicopter ride.

13:14.622 --> 13:15.823
But, hey, a little bromance going on.

13:15.824 --> 13:18.389
I'm not gonna make out with you.

13:18.390 --> 13:19.390
Will, Jennifer, Elise,

13:19.391 --> 13:21.589
we've got work to do.

13:21.590 --> 13:23.421
First of all, the bar needs
a little bit of sprucing up

13:23.422 --> 13:24.621
ahead of tonight's service.

13:24.622 --> 13:25.788
Polishing the stemware,

13:25.789 --> 13:26.890
arranging the bottles,

13:26.891 --> 13:28.422
filling up   the ice buckets.

13:28.423 --> 13:30.723
And then tonight we'll be
serving Paul's dish,

13:30.724 --> 13:32.721
so you'll spend all day preparing that,

13:32.722 --> 13:34.388
cleaning the salmon,   deboning it.

13:34.389 --> 13:35.390
Look after these ones.

13:35.391 --> 13:37.323
Expensive, okay?

13:39.923 --> 13:41.389
That's disgusting.

13:41.390 --> 13:43.256
Oh, this is weak, man.

13:43.257 --> 13:45.122
There they are.

13:45.123 --> 13:46.123
Nice pink shirt, buddy!

13:46.124 --> 13:47.956
Wife, don't get mad at me.

13:47.957 --> 13:49.688
Bring him back in one piece, please.

13:49.689 --> 13:51.990
Paul, you got my lipstick?
Yeah, it's in my pocket.

13:51.991 --> 13:53.622
I'm phenomenally attractive.

13:53.623 --> 13:56.689
I mean, seriously, like, would
you not want to invite this?

13:56.690 --> 13:57.756
[Laughter]

13:57.757 --> 13:58.821
Why you blushing?

13:58.822 --> 14:00.123
Oh, my God, will you leave me alone?

14:00.124 --> 14:02.156
Will and Jennifer are joking and laughing.

14:02.157 --> 14:04.390
And I'm thinking, am I the
only one pissed right now

14:04.391 --> 14:06.522
that I'm doing the punishment?

14:06.523 --> 14:08.023

14:08.024 --> 14:09.856
are grounded at Hell's Kitchen,

Paul and Tommy are about
to take to the sky.

14:12.323 --> 14:13.688
Congratulations.   let's go.

14:13.689 --> 14:14.988
Good job. Paul, good job.

14:14.989 --> 14:16.155
Thank you, chef.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.788
I've never been on a helicopter before.

14:17.789 --> 14:19.557
I mean, chef's used to
this [Bleep], I'm not.

14:19.558 --> 14:22.289
This is gonna be awesome.

14:22.290 --> 14:23.555

Paul, congratulations.

14:23.556 --> 14:24.688

Yes, well done, buddy.

14:25.691 --> 14:26.989
Beautiful.

14:26.990 --> 14:28.790
This is gorgeous, I will have to say.

14:28.791 --> 14:29.889
Wow.

14:29.890 --> 14:31.357
(Tommy) Yeah, this is really wild.

14:31.358 --> 14:32.490
Amazing.

14:37.057 --> 14:38.656
(Gordon)   oh, my God.

14:38.657 --> 14:39.890
Oh, I'm so scared of heights.

14:39.891 --> 14:41.522
Whoo. Whoa, [Bleep].

14:41.523 --> 14:43.856
Tommy was getting a little freaked out.

14:43.857 --> 14:44.955
He had white knuckles on his legs.

14:44.956 --> 14:46.088
Tommy, how could you be scared?

14:46.089 --> 14:47.090
You can see the ground.

14:47.091 --> 14:48.622
I sure can.

14:48.623 --> 14:50.222
It just occurred to me

14:50.223 --> 14:51.323
that we're landing on a rooftop.

14:51.324 --> 14:54.323
This is definitely quite the adventure.

14:56.290 --> 14:57.321
Congratulations. Thank you.

14:57.322 --> 14:58.355
Good job. You nailed it.

14:58.356 --> 14:59.455
Yes, I did. Thank you.

14:59.456 --> 15:00.857
(Announcer) While Paul and Tommy

15:00.858 --> 15:02.557
are enjoying the high life...

15:04.490 --> 15:05.990
The punishment back at Hell's Kitchen

15:05.991 --> 15:09.122
is far from glamorous.

15:09.123 --> 15:10.422
Elise?

15:10.423 --> 15:12.657
I'm scared to mess it up. It's pretty big.

15:14.123 --> 15:16.021
I don't need to be smelling like fish.

15:16.022 --> 15:17.055
I don't roll like that.

15:17.056 --> 15:18.255
(Jennifer)   I'll do it.

15:18.256 --> 15:19.257
I'm actually excited about it.

15:19.258 --> 15:20.356
Now I go here?

15:20.357 --> 15:21.521
Now what you're gonna do

15:21.522 --> 15:22.655
is you're gonna   take the knife,

15:22.656 --> 15:23.657
follow the gills up to the head.

15:23.658 --> 15:25.189
Okay?

15:25.190 --> 15:26.221
It totally pisses me off

22:56.789 --> 22:58.287
It's such a shame!

22:58.288 --> 23:00.287
If you both start talking,

23:00.288 --> 23:01.288
there's harmony. There's no harmony.

23:01.289 --> 23:03.254
When are we doing the re-fire?

23:03.255 --> 23:04.519
Elise, a minute and a half.

23:04.520 --> 23:06.288
Minute and a half, heard.
Dropping scallops.

23:08.221 --> 23:09.520
Risotto. Hot Pan, chef.

23:09.521 --> 23:11.220
Good girl. Working.

23:11.221 --> 23:12.321
Where's the scallop?

23:12.322 --> 23:14.387
Behind you, chef.

23:14.388 --> 23:15.521
Nicely cooked, the scallops.

23:15.522 --> 23:16.887
Thank you, chef.

23:16.888 --> 23:17.886
(Announcer) With Jennifer and Elise

23:17.887 --> 23:18.953
finally communicating...

23:18.954 --> 23:19.955
Service, please.

23:19.956 --> 23:22.254
Appetizers are finding their way

23:22.255 --> 23:23.554
to grateful customers.

23:23.555 --> 23:24.554
Enjoy.

23:24.555 --> 23:25.555
Thank you very much.

23:25.556 --> 23:26.987
It's so good.

23:26.988 --> 23:29.320
(Announcer) It's 45 minutes 
into dinner service,

23:29.321 --> 23:31.587
and after a slow start on appetizers

23:31.588 --> 23:35.320
chef Ramsay wants to speed
up delivery of the food.

23:35.321 --> 23:36.886
Let's go, one mussels,
one lobster capellini.

23:36.887 --> 23:38.886
Entree, two salmon, one new
York steak, one Wellington.

23:38.887 --> 23:40.053
(All) Yes, chef.

23:40.054 --> 23:41.655
(Announcer) So he now has his final five

23:41.656 --> 23:44.020
working on pushing out
appetizers and entrees

23:44.021 --> 23:45.487
at the same time.

23:45.488 --> 23:46.488
How long, Paul?

23:46.489 --> 23:47.820
Two minutes.

23:47.821 --> 23:48.921
One strip, one welly

23:48.922 --> 23:50.787
going with two fish.

23:50.788 --> 23:51.986
You need more time on this or no?

23:51.987 --> 23:53.319
Yeah, I need more than two minutes.

23:53.320 --> 23:54.555
After the way the challenge went,

23:54.556 --> 23:56.454
I gotta dust myself off

23:56.455 --> 23:59.154
and prove to chef I can cook salmon.

23:59.155 --> 24:00.319
Where is the salmon?

24:00.320 --> 24:01.388
One minute out, chef.

24:01.389 --> 24:04.487
One strip and a Wellington coming up.

24:04.488 --> 24:05.954
[Bleep]

24:05.955 --> 24:06.954

24:06.955 --> 24:07.954

24:15.221 --> 24:16.220
Hey, you.

24:16.221 --> 24:17.219
Hey, come here, you.

24:17.220 --> 24:18.221
You, come here.

24:18.222 --> 24:20.120
Is that what you presented to me?

24:20.121 --> 24:23.254
Is that what the best dish of the day was?

24:23.255 --> 24:25.186
It's definitely not my dish,
the one that I made today.

24:25.187 --> 24:26.453
It's not that at all.

24:26.454 --> 24:27.988
It's an over-[Bleep]-cooked
piece of salmon.

24:27.989 --> 24:30.220
Look at the state of that.

24:30.221 --> 24:33.487
Dry as [Bleep].

24:33.488 --> 24:35.254
Oh, send the meat please, Scott.

24:35.255 --> 24:36.621
(Announcer) Hoping that the fish re-fire

24:36.622 --> 24:39.354
from Elise is only a short time away,

24:39.355 --> 24:41.920
chef Ramsay has decided to break his rule

24:41.921 --> 24:43.855
and send out only half
of the table's entrees.

24:43.856 --> 24:45.387
Um...

24:45.388 --> 24:47.286
It's gonna get cold at some point, so...

24:47.287 --> 24:48.519
We're dragging the salmon.

24:48.520 --> 24:50.021
I've sent half the meat
in front of the salmon.

24:50.022 --> 24:52.254
It's coming, chef.

24:52.255 --> 24:53.921
Put it down, [Bleep]. Yes, chef, yes, chef.

24:53.922 --> 24:55.820
Come here, you.

24:55.821 --> 24:57.020
Yeah.

24:57.021 --> 24:59.487
Touch this skin.

24:59.488 --> 25:00.753
This skin's soggy.

25:00.754 --> 25:03.186
Cook it on the bottom,
not the [Bleep] skin.

25:03.187 --> 25:05.019
Elise, you're gonna overcook
if you try to sear the skin.

25:05.020 --> 25:07.255
You gotta just leave it on the
skin, put it in the oven...

25:07.256 --> 25:11.255
You cook the fish for 99% on its skin.

25:11.521 --> 25:12.919
The skin was still [Bleep] soft.

25:12.920 --> 25:14.721
That just means you don't
know how to cook fish.

25:14.722 --> 25:17.387
I mean, this is, like,
straight up chef 101.

25:17.388 --> 25:18.387
Paul. Yep?

25:18.388 --> 25:19.386
Can you look at my fish

25:19.387 --> 25:20.488
so I can get a grip

25:20.489 --> 25:23.054
and send the rest of them out right?

25:23.055 --> 25:24.354
What do you think, Paul?

25:24.355 --> 25:26.054
You gotta leave 'em on the skin.

25:26.055 --> 25:27.754
That's what I [Bleep] up.

25:27.755 --> 25:28.953
Thanks, [Bleep].

25:28.954 --> 25:30.719
You shoulda told me that
[Bleep] 20 minutes ago.

25:30.720 --> 25:32.288
Just leave it there.
But I don't want it to overcook.

25:32.289 --> 25:35.187
It's not gonna overcook. Okay.

25:35.188 --> 25:36.554
[Bleep].

25:36.555 --> 25:38.654

25:44.922 --> 25:47.887
You are served.

25:47.888 --> 25:49.086
Yeah, flip it over on the skin.

25:49.087 --> 25:50.421
Don't take it off   the skin.

25:50.422 --> 25:52.820
Why is it not cooking   on the skin?

25:52.821 --> 25:54.688
I guess I thought I was gonna burn it.

25:54.689 --> 25:56.420
What?

25:57.488 --> 25:59.287

25:59.288 --> 26:00.620

26:00.621 --> 26:01.921
I don't know what else
to do other than take

hit Elise in the head.

38:58.518 --> 38:59.852
Darling, come here.

39:03.985 --> 39:05.917
The heart is amazing.

39:05.918 --> 39:07.817
The palate is extraordinary.

39:07.818 --> 39:11.151
I just don't think you're
ready to run a team.

39:11.152 --> 39:12.851
You're a lady,

39:12.852 --> 39:14.617
and you don't like fighting.

39:14.618 --> 39:17.051
No, I fight, I just...

39:17.052 --> 39:18.250
I wanna fight against

39:18.251 --> 39:19.516
these [Bleep] two [Bleep]   right now.

39:19.517 --> 39:20.650
I want to show them
where I [Bleep] stand.

39:20.651 --> 39:21.850
I can't believe you two

39:21.851 --> 39:23.083
would actually sit here

39:23.084 --> 39:24.618
and say that she is better than me.

39:24.619 --> 39:25.617
I am.

39:25.618 --> 39:26.750
I have a [Bleep] better palate

39:26.751 --> 39:27.916
and I can cook way better...

39:27.917 --> 39:29.285
You didn't show it in the challenge.

39:29.286 --> 39:30.284
What?

39:30.285 --> 39:31.684
Elise, Elise, Elise...

39:31.685 --> 39:32.850
That's totally the wrong
way to go about this.

39:32.851 --> 39:34.150
You're going about this   all wrong.

39:34.151 --> 39:35.618
Totally the wrong way. All right.

39:36.952 --> 39:39.985
Thank you. Please give me your jacket.

39:41.152 --> 39:42.152
Thank you, chef.

39:42.153 --> 39:43.217
Thank you.

39:43.218 --> 39:45.151
Good night.

39:45.152 --> 39:46.585
Keep your head up, Jennifer.

39:46.586 --> 39:48.518
[Bleep] You.

39:51.952 --> 39:53.018
Pork's actually quite nice. Thank you.

39:53.019 --> 39:54.684
And push! Oh, my God!

39:54.685 --> 39:56.684
You get your ass up there,
and you [Bleep] fight.

39:56.685 --> 39:58.951
I am gonna fight. Fight with him!

39:58.952 --> 40:00.718
You know, I'm tired of being second best.

40:00.719 --> 40:02.716
I want to be the best.
That's why I came here.

40:02.717 --> 40:04.118
I think it's the best one we've had so far.

40:04.119 --> 40:05.418
Great job. Thank you.

40:05.419 --> 40:08.017
I work [Bleep] hard with them, for them.

40:08.018 --> 40:10.184
I make sure you guys are [Bleep] great.

40:10.185 --> 40:12.351
Toast to Jennifer.

40:12.352 --> 40:14.617
You know, to make it this
far in Hell's Kitchen,

40:14.618 --> 40:17.217
I proved to myself that I can cook.

40:17.218 --> 40:18.685
The lamb's delicious. Thank you, chef.

40:18.686 --> 40:20.684
Jennifer. Oh, [Bleep].

40:20.685 --> 40:22.016
You won it for your team. Go and join them.

40:22.017 --> 40:23.618
That's the only good thing right now.

40:23.619 --> 40:25.684
They get to deal with Elise. Excuse me.

40:25.685 --> 40:26.684
Jeez.

40:26.685 --> 40:28.817
Shut up for five [Bleep] seconds.

40:28.818 --> 40:30.217
You don't shut up!

40:30.218 --> 40:31.984
I have more passion and more heart

40:31.985 --> 40:33.551
than any of these [Bleep].

40:33.552 --> 40:34.816
They're lucky I'm gone,

40:34.817 --> 40:36.452
'cause I would have kicked all their asses

40:36.453 --> 40:39.152
because I can [Bleep] cook.

40:41.185 --> 40:42.484
It's so hard

40:42.485 --> 40:44.784
for me to forget a night like tonight.

40:44.785 --> 40:47.184
But you can help me by bouncing back.

40:47.185 --> 40:48.617
(All) Yes, chef!

40:48.618 --> 40:50.051
Get out of here.

40:50.052 --> 40:52.217
Good night, chef.

40:52.218 --> 40:54.484
I might be getting played
like a [Bleep] fiddle.

40:54.485 --> 40:55.684
I don't know.

40:55.685 --> 40:58.051
All I know is, is that
if I am getting played

40:58.052 --> 40:59.817
it's gonna bite her in the ass.

40:59.818 --> 41:01.684
I just can't even believe it.

41:01.685 --> 41:03.518
Like, I just had a moment
of brilliance, that's all.

41:03.519 --> 41:07.151
We all have 'em, but not as good as me.

41:07.152 --> 41:09.051
I can look at myself in the mirror

41:09.052 --> 41:10.885
and know that I did what was right.

41:10.886 --> 41:12.717
Total honesty, Elise can cook.

41:12.718 --> 41:14.518
The people that are here
deserve to be here.

41:14.519 --> 41:16.051
Whoo!

41:16.052 --> 41:19.451
Jennifer finally found her
voice in Hell's Kitchen.

41:19.452 --> 41:23.452
Unfortunately, it was when
she was being eliminated.

41:24.448 --> 41:28.248
Sync by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

41:30.152 --> 41:32.584
(Announcer) Next time on  Hell's Kitchen,

41:32.585 --> 41:35.051
it's the two-hour season finale.

41:35.052 --> 41:37.751
Tommy, will, Paul, and Elise

41:37.752 --> 41:40.551
are ready to do whatever
it takes to claim victory.

41:40.552 --> 41:43.151
I am ready to beat the
[Bleep] out of people.

41:43.152 --> 41:45.551
Kill 'em all and sort the
bodies out later on.

41:45.552 --> 41:48.417
(Announcer) First they have
to prove they're worthy.

41:48.418 --> 41:49.917
Tonight it's all about leadership.

41:49.918 --> 41:51.584
I'm bringing everything I have.

41:51.585 --> 41:54.217
(Announcer) But running the
pass has its challenges.

41:54.218 --> 41:55.483
I've answered you a thousand times.

41:55.484 --> 41:57.118
No, you haven't! Two [Bleep] minutes!

41:57.119 --> 41:58.617
[Imitates car crash]

41:58.618 --> 42:01.451
(Announcer) Especially when
everyone has their own agenda.

42:01.452 --> 42:03.951
I guess I'm kind of the snake
in the grass on this one.

42:03.952 --> 42:06.884
(Announcer) In the most cutthroat
dinner service of the season.

42:06.885 --> 42:08.250
I'll give it to you right now.

42:08.251 --> 42:09.283
Don't interrupt me, and
I'll [Bleep] tell you.

42:09.284 --> 42:10.485
Is this for real?

42:10.486 --> 42:12.551
It looks like it's been chewed by your dog!

42:12.552 --> 42:15.484
(Announcer) You won't believe
what these chefs will do...

42:15.485 --> 42:17.084
Don't try to [Bleep] me like this.

42:17.085 --> 42:18.783
I'm not; You're the one
that's trying to [Bleep] me

42:18.784 --> 42:19.983
with my pants on.

42:19.984 --> 42:21.883
(Announcer) To make it to the finals.

42:21.884 --> 42:23.085
Are you deliberately
trying to [Bleep] me here?

42:23.086 --> 42:25.051
No, that was an accident.

42:25.052 --> 42:27.316
Elise, I think she's a
really, really shady female.

42:27.317 --> 42:28.650
The second she gets a chance,

42:28.651 --> 42:29.952
she's gonna stick a knife
right in your back.

42:29.953 --> 42:31.984
(Announcer) Find out who are the final two.

42:31.985 --> 42:34.984
Three...Two...One.

42:34.985 --> 42:36.984
(Announcer) And who will win it all.

42:36.985 --> 42:39.417
High five to that.

42:39.418 --> 42:40.752
(Announcer) And become head chef

42:40.753 --> 42:42.484
at BLT Steak in New York City

42:42.485 --> 42:45.217
on the most unexpected...

42:45.218 --> 42:47.516
I feel like will knows now
that it's a competition.

42:47.517 --> 42:48.952
He's scared. (Announcer) Passionate...

42:48.953 --> 42:50.984
Tommy, talk to me!

42:50.985 --> 42:52.283
Do everything in my power to
make sure she doesn't win.

42:52.284 --> 42:53.952
(Announcer) Hell's Kitchen finale...

42:53.953 --> 42:55.684
She's the [Bleep] devil!

42:55.685 --> 42:57.517
Oh, my God.

42:57.518 --> 43:00.152
(Announcer) Ever.
