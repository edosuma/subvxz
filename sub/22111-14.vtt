WEBVTT

00:03.104 --> 00:05.273
Let's go.

00:05.306 --> 00:07.541
Thank you, Brother Bao.
SAM: We think
Hetty's in trouble,

00:07.575 --> 00:09.043
and we think we know
where she may be.

00:09.077 --> 00:10.544
Vietnam?
Admiral Chegwidden
was looking for her.

00:10.578 --> 00:13.247
He was in Ho Chi Minh City
with Charles Langston.

00:13.281 --> 00:15.649
You will give up your
secrets, one way or another.

00:19.153 --> 00:21.389
This is not gonna end well
for either of us.

00:23.257 --> 00:25.526
MOSLEY: I suggest you figure out
why she's there.

00:25.559 --> 00:27.295
Might want to start with
who took that photo.

00:27.328 --> 00:29.197
We're booked on the next
Air China flight to Vietnam.

00:29.230 --> 00:30.464
Let's go get Hetty.

00:30.498 --> 00:33.101
I have a surprise for you.
He's very hungry.

00:33.134 --> 00:34.635
A man eater.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.210
*

01:04.732 --> 01:06.700
ALLEN:
It's definitely her.

01:15.476 --> 01:17.145
He says none of it is useful.

01:17.178 --> 01:18.712
She's been extremely difficult.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.614
And I have
limited resources here.

01:20.648 --> 01:23.151
I'm confident you can get
everything you want from her,

01:23.184 --> 01:25.219
but you'll probably
have to kill her to do so.

01:25.253 --> 01:27.255
I figured you'd want
to do that yourself.

01:33.227 --> 01:36.330
How was your trip?

01:36.364 --> 01:37.398
Where is she?

01:37.431 --> 01:38.899
She needed some fresh air.

01:42.636 --> 01:46.307
DANG: Oh, Princess,
we have visitor.

01:53.481 --> 01:54.448
MAN:
He says...

01:54.482 --> 01:56.850
I know what the hell he says.

01:58.552 --> 02:02.856
I always hoped
we would meet again, WupÃ³.

02:14.302 --> 02:16.304
*

02:41.329 --> 02:44.232
Hey. They've all
been away before.

02:44.265 --> 02:47.301
Didn't go so well
last time, did it?

02:47.335 --> 02:49.203
And they weren't
looking for Hetty.

02:49.237 --> 02:50.704
Have you heard
from them yet?

02:50.738 --> 02:52.540
Soon.
All right.

02:52.573 --> 02:53.774
Let me know as soon as you do.

02:53.807 --> 02:55.709
Of course.

02:55.743 --> 02:57.711
NELL: So, any luck
with the helicopter?

02:57.745 --> 02:59.913
Do you have any idea how
many rotary wing aircraft

02:59.947 --> 03:01.382
were destroyed
during Vietnam?

03:01.415 --> 03:03.417
I mean, not exact numbers.
I imagine it was a lot.

03:03.451 --> 03:04.718
5,000.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.320
Geez.

03:06.354 --> 03:07.821
That crash must have
happened after the war.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.523
That should help.
Hetty and the others

03:09.557 --> 03:11.692
weren't really even supposed
to be there, so finding records

03:11.725 --> 03:13.894
of anything they did is
proving next to impossible.

03:13.927 --> 03:16.397
But there has to be
some sort of casualty report,

03:16.430 --> 03:17.731
at least for the pilot.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.400
Nope. Not if they were CIA.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.402
She is not making this
any easier, is she?

03:21.435 --> 03:22.202
No.

03:22.236 --> 03:24.004
Have you tried
contacting Sabatino?

03:24.037 --> 03:26.006
Yeah, but he wasn't even alive
when this happened.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.676
Right, but maybe there was
some mentor at the agency

03:28.709 --> 03:30.811
or, I don't know, an instructor
from way back when

03:30.844 --> 03:32.313
who remembers something.

03:32.346 --> 03:33.146
Might be worth
a shot, right?

03:33.180 --> 03:34.382
At this point,
I will try anything.

03:34.415 --> 03:39.287
Hate to say it, but I think
it may be time to call SECNAV.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.021
I mean, she is a fan of
Hetty's, and she will have

03:41.054 --> 03:43.857
access to people and information
that we just simply don't.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.993
That's a really good idea.
You should call her.

03:46.026 --> 03:48.462
Why me?
Well, it was your idea.

03:48.496 --> 03:51.265
Technically, you have seniority.

03:51.299 --> 03:53.967
Yeah, but, you know, you're
a woman and she's a woman.

03:54.001 --> 03:56.337
Okay. What does that
have to do with anything?

03:56.370 --> 03:58.439
Well, you know, the...

03:59.473 --> 04:02.576
To be honest...

04:02.610 --> 04:03.977
she scares me.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.513
There. I said it.

04:05.546 --> 04:08.916
Okay, Eric,
why does she scare you?

04:08.949 --> 04:11.352
It's a long story
involving a layover in Dulles,

04:11.385 --> 04:13.421
visiting Greek dignitaries,
and a pet ferret.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.656
To be fair,
it was not my pet ferret.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.791
Eric, you are a man
of many mysteries,

04:17.825 --> 04:20.294
most of which belong
in Weird Tales.

04:20.328 --> 04:22.363
Love Weird Tales.
I'm still looking for

04:22.396 --> 04:24.665
the February 1928 issue,
first publication of

04:24.698 --> 04:26.400
Lovecraft's "Call of Cthulhu."

04:26.434 --> 04:27.668
See? I rest my case.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.036
There you go.
There it is.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.378
You need anything else?

04:37.411 --> 04:40.914
I have, uh, leopards,
monkeys, pangolins.

04:40.948 --> 04:44.017
How about some meow meow?

04:47.388 --> 04:48.188
He wants her cleaned up.

04:48.221 --> 04:50.057
DANG: Sure. Sure.
Any preference?

04:50.090 --> 04:54.362
Want her to look like a
local or a schoolgirl?

04:54.395 --> 04:56.430
I can even put her
in wedding dress.

05:07.107 --> 05:09.543
I wouldn't push your luck

05:09.577 --> 05:11.078
if I were you.

05:11.111 --> 05:13.013
You're not me.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.715
How's that ear?

05:21.422 --> 05:24.425
(upbeat pop song playing
in foreign language)

05:36.136 --> 05:38.839
Beers.

05:40.107 --> 05:42.075
KENSI :
Looks like you boys

05:42.109 --> 05:43.310
made yourself some friends.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.813
SAM: Yeah, they been with us
ever since the police station.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.781
How'd you make out
with the local five

05:47.815 --> 05:49.016
Well, they weren't exactly
pleased to find out

05:49.049 --> 05:51.084
that we're looking for four
people who entered their country

05:51.118 --> 05:52.753
without going through
customs or immigration.

05:52.786 --> 05:53.854
They're willing
to cooperate?

05:53.887 --> 05:54.922
SAM:
That's a good question.

05:54.955 --> 05:55.989
We thought about losing them,
but it seems like

05:56.023 --> 05:58.091
it's more trouble than
it's worth at this point.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.528
If we need some guns, at least
we know where we can get some.

06:00.561 --> 06:02.530
We are not taking their guns.
Not yet.

06:05.132 --> 06:06.934
You guys ask
around a bit?

06:06.967 --> 06:08.636
No, we figured we'd wait
till you got here

06:08.669 --> 06:10.471
in case we spooked anybody
or asked the wrong people.

06:10.504 --> 06:12.105
And this is just
a gentle reminder that this is

06:12.139 --> 06:13.674
essentially an authoritarian
police state,

06:13.707 --> 06:15.843
so if we could keep this
on the low low,

06:15.876 --> 06:16.944
well, that'd be great.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.979
This trip is off book already.

06:19.012 --> 06:23.150
Things go sideways, NCIS will be
forced to disown us.

06:23.183 --> 06:25.653
Probably never be seen again.

06:25.686 --> 06:27.187
Let's make sure
that doesn't happen.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.122
Worst vacation ever.

06:29.156 --> 06:31.124
*

06:42.703 --> 06:44.705
Damn it.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.075
How's it going?

06:48.108 --> 06:50.911
Well, I've recently discovered

06:50.944 --> 06:53.146
that Hetty has
her pilot's license,

06:53.180 --> 06:56.684
has an ongoing game of Catan
with Elon Musk,

06:56.717 --> 06:59.086
and is currently being courted
by a noted entomologist

06:59.119 --> 07:00.554
who would like to name

07:00.588 --> 07:02.890
a rare species of
Madagascar wasp after her.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.157
:
So, there's that.

07:04.191 --> 07:06.159
Interesting.

07:06.193 --> 07:07.795
Though not at all useful.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.196
Would you like
some help?

07:09.229 --> 07:12.065
Pull up a box.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.067
Just so you know,
we are looking for

07:14.101 --> 07:16.103
anything related
to Southeast Asia

07:16.136 --> 07:18.038
or Vietnam from
1972 to 1978.

07:18.071 --> 07:19.740
So, if you see

07:19.773 --> 07:21.609
any mention of
a helicopter crash

07:21.642 --> 07:24.177
or any casualties
relating to a helo crash,

07:24.211 --> 07:25.212
that would be great.

07:25.245 --> 07:28.081
Also, any photos
or references to

07:28.115 --> 07:31.184
Chegwidden, Langston,
Bridges or Granger, also great.

07:31.218 --> 07:33.153
Got it. Mm-hmm.

07:33.186 --> 07:35.723
Man, this is a needle in
a haystack at this point,

07:35.756 --> 07:37.758
but it's all we got.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.831
You sure all these are Hetty's?

07:43.864 --> 07:45.232
They should be. Why?

07:48.068 --> 07:49.169
Because...

07:51.539 --> 07:52.940
...this looks like

07:52.973 --> 07:54.942
some serious Santeria crap.

07:54.975 --> 07:58.078
Oh, my Godzilla.

07:58.111 --> 07:59.880
Is that a
real lizard?

07:59.913 --> 08:01.248
Don't know,

08:01.281 --> 08:03.116
don't care.
All right, I'm
sure it's just

08:03.150 --> 08:04.985
some evidence from an old case.

08:05.018 --> 08:07.555
We're just gonna pop the
lid back on this guy.
Yeah.

08:07.588 --> 08:10.891
We're gonna put him in
a time-out, and, uh,

08:10.924 --> 08:12.059
why don't you take my box.

08:12.092 --> 08:12.993
I'll find another one.

08:13.026 --> 08:15.996
I need to wash my hands--
in holy water.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.130
Really?

08:17.164 --> 08:20.100
Wasn't that bad.
I've seen way worse.

08:20.133 --> 08:22.102
BARTENDER: Yeah, she'd been here
a couple times.

08:22.135 --> 08:23.637
But that was a few months back.

08:23.671 --> 08:24.772
SAM:
You talk to her?

08:24.805 --> 08:27.207
No, but I remember
seeing her.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.075
CALLEN:
Was she with anyone?

08:28.108 --> 08:29.309
Mm, I don't know.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.278
You guys don't have
surveillance cameras?

08:31.311 --> 08:32.546
Nah.

08:32.580 --> 08:33.647
Did she meet anyone?

08:33.681 --> 08:34.948
Don't know.

08:34.982 --> 08:36.850
But when it gets busy,
I'm lucky if I can

08:36.884 --> 08:38.185
remember everyone's drink order.

08:38.218 --> 08:38.886
Sorry.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.821
What about any of these guys?

08:40.854 --> 08:42.556
WAITRESS:
Yeah, they have been in here

08:42.590 --> 08:43.724
a few time.

08:43.757 --> 08:45.859
They were asking
about the same lady.

08:45.893 --> 08:46.994
Who is she?

08:47.027 --> 08:48.128
She's a friend.

08:48.161 --> 08:50.130
Oh. She missing?

08:50.163 --> 08:52.800
Possibly.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.201
Did you try
talking to the police?

08:54.234 --> 08:55.102
Oh, we're working
with the police.

08:55.135 --> 08:56.904
KENSI: Yeah. Did you
see these three men

08:56.937 --> 08:57.971
with anybody else?

08:58.005 --> 09:00.040
Mm, I don't think so.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.975
DEEKS: Did they say
where they were staying?

09:02.009 --> 09:03.076
Not to me.

09:03.110 --> 09:06.213
They were real gentlemen,
which is nice for a change.

09:06.246 --> 09:08.782
Yeah, I can only imagine.
Uh, they did leave me

09:08.816 --> 09:09.983
a number where I could

09:10.017 --> 09:11.685
reach them if I saw
their friend again

09:11.719 --> 09:13.020
or thought of
anything else.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.087
Oh.

09:14.121 --> 09:15.055
Thank you so much.

09:15.088 --> 09:16.089
DEEKS:
Thanks.

09:19.860 --> 09:20.861
KENSI:
Hey, Eric?

09:20.894 --> 09:21.795
How's Vietnam?

09:21.829 --> 09:24.131
Cool. I just wish
I was here to enjoy it.

09:24.164 --> 09:25.265
Hey, um, listen,
I'm sending you a number

09:25.298 --> 09:27.234
that we think Chegwidden
and the others might be using.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.269
All right. I got it.

09:29.302 --> 09:31.639
You try calling it?
KENSI: No. I was hoping

09:31.672 --> 09:32.906
you could find it first so that

09:32.940 --> 09:34.141
we don't tip them off
we're here.

09:34.174 --> 09:36.209
Okay, sounds good. Oh.

09:36.243 --> 09:38.646
It's a sat phone;
this should be pretty easy.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.381
Or not.

09:41.414 --> 09:42.750
It's turned off.

09:42.783 --> 09:44.985
Can you switch it back on?

09:45.018 --> 09:46.019
Uh, possibly.
Might need a little time.

09:46.053 --> 09:48.155
Okay, send us the location
as soon as it's on.

09:48.188 --> 09:50.223
Yeah. I'll also try
to track any previous calls.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.224
Great. Thank you.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.860
NELL:
Excuse me!

09:52.893 --> 09:54.127
Pardon me. I am coming through.

09:54.161 --> 09:55.162
Watch the tootsies!

09:55.195 --> 09:57.230
Whew! That was a close one.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.232
All right. Uh, hey, Harley,
can you give me a hand with

09:59.266 --> 10:00.868
this top box here?
I just need to...

10:00.901 --> 10:03.236
Hi, sis.
Sydney?

10:03.270 --> 10:04.404
How'd you get in here?

10:04.437 --> 10:06.974
I heard Hetty was in trouble
and you could use a hand.

10:07.007 --> 10:08.375
Oh. Did Harley call you?

10:08.408 --> 10:10.077
Who?

10:10.110 --> 10:12.179
Uh, Harley Hidoko.
Oh, no, it was

10:12.212 --> 10:14.081
your executive
assistant director.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.382
Mosley?

10:15.415 --> 10:16.884
That's the one.

10:16.917 --> 10:19.386
Is there a problem?

10:19.419 --> 10:21.254
Uh, no, that's...

10:21.288 --> 10:23.857
No, we're fine.
Okay.

10:23.891 --> 10:25.092
Harley already
gave me the run down.

10:25.125 --> 10:28.729
Great. Well...
uh, thanks for helping.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.163
Glad I could help.

10:32.199 --> 10:36.036
Whoa. Is this real?

10:36.069 --> 10:37.104
What is it?

10:37.137 --> 10:38.839
I looks like
a Christmas card

10:38.872 --> 10:40.273
from Queen Elizabeth.

10:40.307 --> 10:43.143
Aw. "Best wishes for
Christmas and the New Year.

10:43.176 --> 10:45.913
"Looking forward to
catching up at Sandringham.

10:45.946 --> 10:48.215
Elizabeth and Philip."
Oh, my God.

10:48.248 --> 10:50.217
Hetty spends Christmas
with the queen?

10:50.250 --> 10:52.119
I mean, I don't
think it was, like,

10:52.152 --> 10:54.855
an every Christmas
thing, but wow.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.757
I want to spend
Christmas with the queen.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.091
:
Excuse me, mum.

10:58.125 --> 11:00.694
Would you like me
to walk the corgis?

11:00.728 --> 11:02.763
: Oh, that
would be lovely, dear.

11:02.796 --> 11:04.765
I'll ride Curlew out to
meet you for some tea.

11:04.798 --> 11:06.800
Oh.

11:06.834 --> 11:09.269
:
Wait a second.

11:09.302 --> 11:11.104
Where's Hetty's mail being sent?

11:11.138 --> 11:13.373
It's not like she's
having it sent here.

11:13.406 --> 11:16.176
She sold off
most of her properties.

11:16.209 --> 11:18.846
Not that she would have
personal mail sent there anyway.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.080
You never sent her
anything by mail?

11:20.113 --> 11:21.715
No. I never had the need.

11:21.749 --> 11:24.117
And the Postal Service
only holds mail for 30 days.

11:24.151 --> 11:25.085
Yeah.
She's been gone months.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.287
Which means somebody's
getting it for her.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.455
Huh.

11:28.488 --> 11:31.124
Hey. Did that have
an envelope with it?

11:31.158 --> 11:32.860
Uh, no.

11:32.893 --> 11:35.095
Okay, we need to find something
with an address on it.

11:35.128 --> 11:37.130
Okay. Mm-hmm.
Let's do it.

11:41.869 --> 11:43.737
Okay, so...

11:46.774 --> 11:48.909
Enter.

11:48.942 --> 11:51.912
Thank you.

11:51.945 --> 11:54.247
I think we may have a lead
to finding Hetty.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.087
A postal box?

12:00.120 --> 12:02.923
Yes, I believe her mail is being
sent and most likely held there.

12:02.956 --> 12:04.491
Now, if we can get
access to her mail,

12:04.524 --> 12:06.159
there is no telling
what we'll find.

12:06.193 --> 12:08.061
You want a warrant?

12:08.095 --> 12:10.163
Yes.
Okay. I'll see what I can do.

12:10.197 --> 12:12.265
Great.

12:14.167 --> 12:16.136
This is when you leave.

12:16.169 --> 12:17.470
Right.

12:17.504 --> 12:20.307
Thank you.
Thank you.
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

12:42.162 --> 12:45.165
You need to get
cleaned up.

12:45.198 --> 12:48.168
Why?

12:48.201 --> 12:50.170
Our friend paid
good money for you.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.372
You need to look presentable.

12:52.405 --> 12:55.275
Where's Keane?

12:57.244 --> 12:58.912
He died.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.369
Ah. Y'all made
out well.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.938
Yeah, hopefully something
in here is helpful.

13:24.972 --> 13:27.140
I'll take those Bed
Bath & Beyond coupons

13:27.174 --> 13:28.375
if they're
up for grabs.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.010
I bet you would.
Uh-huh.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.344
I'm gonna give Mosley
a sitrep.

13:31.378 --> 13:32.846
Okay.

13:32.880 --> 13:35.448
Well, dig in, sister.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.120
Hmm.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.521
Enter.

13:43.356 --> 13:44.257
Where are we?

13:44.291 --> 13:45.993
Beale's trying to
track down a sat phone

13:46.026 --> 13:47.460
Hetty's former colleagues
have been using,

13:47.494 --> 13:50.297
and we retrieved a bunch of mail
from the P.O. box she uses.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.264
Hidoko,
what do you think

13:51.298 --> 13:53.400
our chances are
of bringing her home alive?

13:53.433 --> 13:54.567
I don't know, ma'am.

13:54.601 --> 13:56.203
No one's heard
from her for months,

13:56.236 --> 13:58.371
and even her old buddies
haven't been able to locate her.

13:58.405 --> 14:00.373
Is there anything else
we can be doing?

14:00.407 --> 14:01.608
Not that I can think of.

14:01.641 --> 14:03.376
Well, if you or the others
think of anything,

14:03.410 --> 14:04.311
please let me know.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.146
She deserves all the help
we can give her.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.049
Hidoko.

14:10.183 --> 14:14.021
I want to bring Hetty home
any way we can.

14:14.054 --> 14:16.356
Yes, ma'am.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.464
SAM:
Talk to me, Eric.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.399
Well, they haven't
made any calls,

14:26.433 --> 14:28.902
and I haven't been able
to turn on the phone remotely.

14:28.936 --> 14:30.904
These guys are pros; they
probably only put the battery in

14:30.938 --> 14:32.172
when they need
to make a call.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.473
Yeah, but several of the calls
have been made

14:33.506 --> 14:35.175
from one location;
it's a hotel.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.176
And I just sent you the address.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.110
All right, we'll
check it out.

14:37.144 --> 14:38.311
Let us know if they appear
anywhere else.

14:38.345 --> 14:39.346
ERIC:
Will do.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.148
We'll check out
the three amigos.

14:41.181 --> 14:43.016
DEEKS: What do we do about
those pesky escorts?

14:43.050 --> 14:44.551
SAM: Yeah, they been
with us long enough.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.253
Gonna need the angry girlfriend.

14:46.286 --> 14:47.254
KENSI: Got it.
Two more beers.

14:47.287 --> 14:51.391
(Kensi and Deeks arguing loudly
in Portuguese)

15:10.177 --> 15:11.444
HIDOKO:
Any luck?

15:11.478 --> 15:13.413
Not yet.

15:13.446 --> 15:15.682
Who's Maggie?

15:15.715 --> 15:17.384
That's one of Hetty's aliases.

15:17.417 --> 15:18.351
Yeah.

15:22.322 --> 15:23.523
It's from
the right time period.

15:23.556 --> 15:26.159
It's a birthday card from

15:26.193 --> 15:28.695
a Kim Nguyen in Rancho Park.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.497
Let me see.
Yeah.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.332
I'll see if I can
track her down.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.701
Yeah, check it out.
Mystery Team to the rescue!

15:34.734 --> 15:37.337
Only this time,
I'm gonna be Nancy Drew.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.606
Oh, but you're such a good Togo.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.474
You know, I really don't like...

15:41.508 --> 15:44.544
Togo doesn't talk, remember?

15:55.122 --> 15:56.589
What the hell?
Anytime, G.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.391
I know. It's jammed.

15:58.425 --> 15:59.326
All right, give it to me.
Hand it over.

15:59.359 --> 16:00.360
Oh, okay.

16:00.393 --> 16:02.029
Why don't you be my guest.

16:02.062 --> 16:03.130
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

16:03.163 --> 16:04.464
It's my specialty, boys.

16:04.497 --> 16:07.234
Just give me a second here.

16:08.501 --> 16:10.237
What is happening?

16:10.270 --> 16:12.405
DEEKS: How's it working
out for you

16:12.439 --> 16:14.374
Not so much, huh?

16:15.375 --> 16:16.676
Okay, you know what,
smart

16:16.709 --> 16:18.245
You do it.

16:18.278 --> 16:21.081
Well, if you kids
are done messing around.

16:21.114 --> 16:24.284
The key is to become
one with the device.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.453
It's not so much
a lock to be opened,

16:26.486 --> 16:28.488
it's a puzzle to be solved,

16:28.521 --> 16:30.490
to be understood,
to be tender.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.659
There's something's wrong
with this lock.

16:32.692 --> 16:34.461
Know what? Let me pick the lock.
I got it. Oh!

16:34.494 --> 16:35.795
That works.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.398
Well, you get ten points
for efficiency,

16:38.431 --> 16:40.367
and screw it,
ten points for style.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.135
All right.

16:42.169 --> 16:44.171
Clear.
Clear.

16:44.204 --> 16:45.072
Clear.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.676
Guys.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.348
Huh.

16:55.382 --> 16:56.683
They know we're here.
DEEKS: How?

16:56.716 --> 16:58.551
They knew we were
coming for Hetty.

17:02.455 --> 17:04.424
I found her.

17:04.457 --> 17:05.725
Kim Nguyen came to this country

17:05.758 --> 17:08.428
in 1978 from what was
then Saigon.

17:08.461 --> 17:09.729
Guess who sponsored her.
Hetty.

17:09.762 --> 17:11.698
Yup.
Did you...

17:11.731 --> 17:13.066
Did you contact her?
Yes.

17:13.100 --> 17:14.401
She's agreed to meet us
at the boatshed.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.203
What's the boatshed?
Well, it's...

17:16.236 --> 17:17.737
It's classified.

17:17.770 --> 17:19.772
Okay. Wait up.

17:24.811 --> 17:27.380
Margaret helped my family
to come here after the war.

17:27.414 --> 17:30.417
NELL: Do you recognize any
of the people in this photo?

17:32.452 --> 17:34.221
I remember
some of them.

17:34.254 --> 17:35.388
Do you remember
a young man

17:35.422 --> 17:37.157
who may have also been
part of the group?

17:37.190 --> 17:39.459
He may have even been the
one who took the picture.

17:39.492 --> 17:40.727
Yeah.

17:40.760 --> 17:44.297
His name was Harris or Harrison.

17:44.331 --> 17:45.732
Huh.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.200
What is this about?

17:47.234 --> 17:49.436
Margaret returned to
Vietnam a few months ago.

17:49.469 --> 17:50.803
We haven't heard from her since.

17:50.837 --> 17:53.273
We don't know where she is
or even why she went.

17:53.306 --> 17:55.408
We think she was
in this bar.

17:57.710 --> 18:00.347
Sorry, that means
nothing to me.

18:00.380 --> 18:03.450
I've never been back to Vietnam.

18:03.483 --> 18:05.218
Did you try the monastery?

18:05.252 --> 18:06.853
Um, I'm sorry?

18:06.886 --> 18:09.656
You do know that
Maggie is a Buddhist?

18:09.689 --> 18:11.358
Of course. Yes.
Obviously.

18:11.391 --> 18:12.625
That's where she met my brother.

18:12.659 --> 18:15.795
He helped her
and others find people.

18:15.828 --> 18:19.132
And in return,
she helped me and my family.

18:19.899 --> 18:21.134
We never would have

18:21.168 --> 18:23.370
been able to come here
without her.

18:23.403 --> 18:24.637
Wow.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.439
Um, where is your brother now?

18:28.441 --> 18:32.312
He was killed, long time ago.

18:32.345 --> 18:36.483
But Margaret always stays
with the monk when she can.

18:48.228 --> 18:50.197
SAM:
This place is beautiful.

18:50.230 --> 18:53.800
No wonder Hetty loved it here.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.935
Yeah, it'd be great if
they had a Starbucks.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.538
Could really go for a chai
tea latte right about now.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.607
I told you to sleep
on the plane.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.409
Easier said than done.

19:02.442 --> 19:03.643
Beale lent me his entire
Ren & Stimpy collection.

19:03.676 --> 19:04.544
CALLEN: All right,
thanks, Eric.

19:04.577 --> 19:06.413
Let us know if you
find anything else.

19:06.446 --> 19:07.580
SAM:
They find something?

19:07.614 --> 19:10.850
Well, they may have I.D.'d
another member of Hetty's unit.

19:10.883 --> 19:12.419
Guy named Harris

19:12.452 --> 19:14.421
or, uh, Harrison.
They're looking into it.

19:15.455 --> 19:16.723
How may I help you?

19:16.756 --> 19:19.392
We're looking for
a friend of ours.

19:19.426 --> 19:21.561
BAO:
Ah, yes.

19:21.594 --> 19:24.197
She has stayed here
many times over the years.

19:24.231 --> 19:25.898
Recently?
Few months back.

19:25.932 --> 19:27.234
Till the man came.

19:27.267 --> 19:28.268
What man?

19:28.301 --> 19:29.402
Older. Bald.

19:29.436 --> 19:31.504
He brought a gun
and had to be removed.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.273
Do you still
have that gun?
No.

19:33.306 --> 19:34.307
We destroyed it.

19:35.442 --> 19:36.776
Where'd she go?

19:36.809 --> 19:38.678
I don't know. I'm sorry.

19:42.482 --> 19:45.352
Excuse me.

19:45.385 --> 19:46.686
Thank you.

19:49.489 --> 19:50.757
What's it say?

19:50.790 --> 19:53.426
I don't know.
It's written in Vietnamese.

19:55.395 --> 19:56.829
(Rio speaking excitedly
in Vietnamese)

19:56.863 --> 19:57.897
DEEKS:
Wow.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.399
The band's back together.

20:00.467 --> 20:01.534
Oh, dear God.

20:01.568 --> 20:03.570
It's beautiful out.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.549
I don't know why
you guys are so angry.

20:16.583 --> 20:18.751
I told you my real name,
Jeff Carol, I work for the CIA.

20:18.785 --> 20:19.986
DEEKS:
We thought you were lying.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.321
Why would you think that?

20:21.354 --> 20:22.489
'Cause nothing
you ever said was true.

20:22.522 --> 20:23.356
That's really hurtful.

20:23.390 --> 20:24.991
I worked on that
money laundering case

20:25.024 --> 20:26.459
for about six years, man.

20:26.493 --> 20:28.728
I'm not gonna blow it up
'cause you guys show up.

20:28.761 --> 20:30.763
You went to a cosmetic surgeon
to look like David Hasselhoff.

20:30.797 --> 20:32.499
I had a lot of enemies,
all right?

20:32.532 --> 20:33.500
And everyone
loves the Hoff.

20:33.533 --> 20:34.767
Well, he's got
a point there.

20:34.801 --> 20:36.303
All right, listen,
we're here to find Hetty.

20:36.336 --> 20:37.337
What is your excuse?

20:39.372 --> 20:40.507
Same thing.

20:40.540 --> 20:41.774
All right, that's it.

20:41.808 --> 20:42.775
Back off, buddy,
all right?!

20:42.809 --> 20:43.776
I'm Special Activities Division.

20:43.810 --> 20:44.944
I will kill you all

20:44.977 --> 20:46.446
with my finger,
all right? My finger.

20:49.015 --> 20:50.450
All right, all right, man!

20:50.483 --> 20:51.818
All right.
We heard some chatter

20:51.851 --> 20:52.985
an American agent got captured

20:53.019 --> 20:54.487
and is being sold
to the highest bidder.

20:54.521 --> 20:55.722
KENSI:
And you only thought

20:55.755 --> 20:57.524
to tell us this now?
We didn't know who

20:57.557 --> 20:59.626
or even what
the situation was, okay?

20:59.659 --> 21:01.294
Until your people showed up.

21:01.328 --> 21:03.430
What people?

21:07.900 --> 21:09.469
Wow.

21:09.502 --> 21:11.404
Golden Girls
go to Saigon.

21:11.438 --> 21:12.872
Not these guys.
Damn it, JC.

21:12.905 --> 21:14.607
Why'd you bring
them here?

21:14.641 --> 21:16.676
It's for their own protection,
and you can use their help.

21:16.709 --> 21:18.378
We don't need protection.

21:18.411 --> 21:20.680
And we damn sure
don't need their help.

21:21.881 --> 21:23.516
You guys are so adorable.
I love you guys.

21:23.550 --> 21:25.352
Don't even think about it.
Come on.

21:25.385 --> 21:26.386
All right.

21:28.421 --> 21:30.523
We are so doomed.

21:34.461 --> 21:36.095
So, what's your plan?

21:36.128 --> 21:37.664
My plan?
With my sister.

21:37.697 --> 21:39.566
What are your intentions?

21:39.599 --> 21:42.535
I'm not sure if that's
any of your business.

21:42.569 --> 21:43.903
You two are a thing, aren't you?

21:43.936 --> 21:45.438
I mean, she even
brought you home

21:45.472 --> 21:46.639
for Christmas one year.

21:46.673 --> 21:48.841
That was more as a friend
who was away from his family,

21:48.875 --> 21:51.578
and I'm not sure if I feel
comfortable discussing...

21:51.611 --> 21:53.079
You know she's
my younger sister, right?
Yeah.

21:53.112 --> 21:55.715
So you know
I'm watching you.

21:55.748 --> 22:01.621
And I am very, very protective
of my little Togo.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.556
You should
probably know

22:03.590 --> 22:06.593
that Nell never really
liked being Togo.

22:06.626 --> 22:08.761
Sure she did.
Pretty sure she didn't.

22:08.795 --> 22:10.497
It's a private sister joke.

22:10.530 --> 22:13.600
Yeah, well, it's not funny.
Oh. Whoa.

22:13.633 --> 22:19.372
Somebody woke up on the wrong
side of the Ender Dragon

22:19.406 --> 22:21.608
What's harshin' your
mellow today, code monkey?

22:21.641 --> 22:23.943
Huh? Come on, spit it out,
Rickets. Come on.

22:23.976 --> 22:25.111
You're a bully.

22:25.144 --> 22:27.780
Look, I'm protective
of Nell, too,

22:27.814 --> 22:31.484
but you got to stop bossing
her around like she's a kid.

22:31.518 --> 22:33.520
No, you're right.

22:33.553 --> 22:35.622
I'm not a good person.

22:35.655 --> 22:37.490
I'm not saying that.

22:37.524 --> 22:39.759
Then why did everybody in school
call me Sydney Vicious?

22:39.792 --> 22:42.495
What?

22:42.529 --> 22:44.531
Sydney...

22:44.564 --> 22:48.468
Sydney. Sydney.
Please wait.

22:48.501 --> 22:50.002
Syd

22:50.036 --> 22:51.170
What happened?

22:51.203 --> 22:53.005
I called your sister
the "B" word.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.774
You called her
a bitch?
No!

22:54.807 --> 22:56.175
I called her a bully,
which she is.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.276
Eric, no.

22:57.309 --> 22:59.479
What? I said I was sorry.
Wait, Nell...

22:59.512 --> 23:02.549
SAM:
So where's Hetty now?

23:02.582 --> 23:05.485
We don't know, but we think
we know who has her.

23:05.518 --> 23:07.754
He's a poacher/smuggler
by the name of Dang.

23:09.622 --> 23:11.491
CHEGWIDDEN: We think
he lured her here with Keane.

23:11.524 --> 23:12.625
Who's Keane?

23:12.659 --> 23:13.392
Harris Keane.

23:13.426 --> 23:15.194
CALLEN:
He was in their unit.

23:15.227 --> 23:18.598
Apparently, he died in a
helicopter crash after the war.

23:18.631 --> 23:21.501
We think Dang convinced Hetty
that he was still alive.

23:21.534 --> 23:22.902
So she came to
see for herself.

23:22.935 --> 23:24.437
And when she did,
Dang grabbed her.

23:24.471 --> 23:25.605
Now he's trying to sell her

23:25.638 --> 23:27.574
to the highest bidder.

23:27.607 --> 23:28.908
How do we get her back?

23:40.620 --> 23:43.523
So, Dang operates in here.

23:43.556 --> 23:45.725
It's pretty isolated,
which allows for

23:45.758 --> 23:49.061
his poaching and poppies,
human trafficking, you name it.

23:49.095 --> 23:50.196
Okay, so what are
we waiting for?

23:50.229 --> 23:52.031
No one goes in or out of there
without Dang knowing.

23:52.064 --> 23:53.800
So why don't we call
the police or the army?

23:53.833 --> 23:54.934
CHEGWIDDEN:
He has people in both.

23:54.967 --> 23:56.168
They'd know we were coming
before we left.

23:56.202 --> 23:57.804
Then how do we get in there?

23:57.837 --> 23:59.506
Hope you brought
comfortable shoes.

23:59.539 --> 24:01.073
What

24:01.107 --> 24:02.241
That's, like,
hundreds of miles.

24:02.274 --> 24:03.776
We're not walking
all the way, genius.

24:03.810 --> 24:05.077
We're getting
dropped in by chopper.

24:05.111 --> 24:06.979
How'd you guys get
access to a helo?

24:07.013 --> 24:09.048
We brought
some spending money.

24:09.081 --> 24:10.750
Yeah, I bet you did.

24:11.751 --> 24:13.219
What about weapons?

24:13.252 --> 24:15.121
RIO:
You mean like these?

24:15.154 --> 24:18.057
Yeah, that's right, baby.

24:18.090 --> 24:19.225
Who's your daddy?

24:21.160 --> 24:23.162
Wink at me again
and I will rip out your eye.

24:23.195 --> 24:25.498
I can respect that.

24:25.532 --> 24:28.668
Syd

24:28.701 --> 24:30.503
I shouldn't have come here.

24:30.537 --> 24:32.104
What
You're helping us.

24:32.138 --> 24:35.107
Yeah, but I always
say the wrong things

24:35.141 --> 24:37.677
and I hurt people's feelings,
even when I'm not trying to.

24:37.710 --> 24:39.579
Oh, come on.
Nobody's perfect.

24:39.612 --> 24:41.614
You are.

24:41.648 --> 24:42.882
What are you talking about?

24:42.915 --> 24:44.050
You were always
the most popular,

24:44.083 --> 24:46.218
you made the best grades,
you were the most athletic.

24:46.252 --> 24:47.286
Okay, just stop.

24:47.319 --> 24:50.690
I have wanted to have
this conversation with you

24:50.723 --> 24:55.061
for my entire life, but now
is just not the right time.

24:55.094 --> 24:58.765
I am sorry that Eric called you
a bully, I really am,

24:58.798 --> 25:01.634
but right now I need to focus
on finding Hetty,

25:01.668 --> 25:03.536
and you need to focus
on sucking it up

25:03.570 --> 25:05.237
and getting your butt
back to Ops to help.

25:05.271 --> 25:07.239
And if you're incapable
of doing that,

25:07.273 --> 25:10.610
then please get the hell out of
my way so I can do it myself.

25:14.213 --> 25:18.751
And I am never being Togo again.

25:27.259 --> 25:28.561
Hello?
CALLEN: Eric.

25:28.595 --> 25:30.162
What else you
find out on Dang?

25:30.196 --> 25:31.698
He's a nasty piece of work.

25:31.731 --> 25:34.333
He specializes in
the illegal exotic animal trade,

25:34.366 --> 25:36.035
and has his fingers
in just about

25:36.068 --> 25:37.804
every black market
you can think of.

25:37.837 --> 25:39.305
SAM:
You got a location for him?

25:39.338 --> 25:41.073
You sent us a pretty big area.

25:41.107 --> 25:43.175
Any chance we can get our hands
on a satellite photo?

25:43.209 --> 25:45.244
I put in a request,
but I doubt I'll hear back.

25:45.277 --> 25:46.846
And even if we do,
it'll probably be

25:46.879 --> 25:48.681
a couple weeks.

25:48.715 --> 25:49.716
Did you speak to Sabatino?

25:49.749 --> 25:50.783
Yeah. He confirmed

25:50.817 --> 25:54.887
that Rio is the alias
of CIA Officer Jeff Carol,

25:54.921 --> 25:56.856
which is probably
an alias in itself.

25:56.889 --> 25:59.959
Oh, he was quick to add that
Rio/Jeff is borderline insane.

25:59.992 --> 26:02.662
Borderline? Guy's got a condo
in the middle of crazy country.

26:02.695 --> 26:03.963
Hey, what about a drone?

26:03.996 --> 26:06.132
Any chance we get a
flyover from Subic Bay?

26:06.165 --> 26:07.834
Callen, I don't even think
we have drones on the island.

26:07.867 --> 26:08.935
Well, find out.
I want to know

26:08.968 --> 26:10.369
what the hell
we're walking into.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.271
I will see what I can do.
CALLEN: All right, thanks, Eric.

26:12.304 --> 26:14.206
Isn't this great,
working together again?

26:14.240 --> 26:15.307
We never worked together.

26:15.341 --> 26:17.944
Hey, in the spirit
of cooperation

26:17.977 --> 26:19.278
and full disclosure,

26:19.311 --> 26:20.980
just so that there's
no surprises,

26:21.013 --> 26:22.782
if we find your girl
and it turns out

26:22.815 --> 26:24.083
we can't get her out alive,

26:24.116 --> 26:28.154
then I have my orders
to neutralize the threat.

26:28.187 --> 26:29.722
I'm sorry?

26:29.756 --> 26:32.692
Not my first choice,

26:32.725 --> 26:34.827
just in the interest
of national security.

26:39.198 --> 26:42.268
You lay a finger on Hetty,
I will kill you.

26:42.301 --> 26:43.402
Hmm.

26:43.435 --> 26:44.704
We both will.

26:44.737 --> 26:45.805
Several times over.

26:45.838 --> 26:48.407
This is what I get for sharing?

26:48.440 --> 26:49.876
I mean, you guys
are so closed off,

26:49.909 --> 26:51.310
I mean, it's hard
to talk to you guys.

26:51.343 --> 26:52.378
I'm trying not to,

26:52.411 --> 26:54.814
but I can't guarantee you
I'm not gonna kill him.

26:54.847 --> 26:56.148
CALLEN:
Don't let me stop you.

26:56.182 --> 26:57.884
RIO: I'm trying my best!
MOSLEY: A flyover?

26:57.917 --> 26:59.051
Unless we can get
satellite images.

26:59.085 --> 27:01.387
Without one or the other,
our team is going in blind.

27:01.420 --> 27:03.990
Duly noted.

27:04.023 --> 27:05.357
You're dismissed.

27:09.361 --> 27:12.832
I just allowed four agents
into a foreign country

27:12.865 --> 27:15.234
to rescue a former NCIS legend

27:15.267 --> 27:17.336
without any authorization
from the government

27:17.369 --> 27:19.305
or support from
local authorities.

27:19.338 --> 27:21.674
I don't know if
I'm an altruist or suicidal.

27:21.708 --> 27:23.743
You're human, ma'am.

27:25.111 --> 27:26.846
That's the best
we can ever hope to be.

27:26.879 --> 27:30.282
Great. You can tell them that
when this costs me my career.

27:38.324 --> 27:41.293
*

28:06.485 --> 28:07.854
CALLEN:
Sam and I will walk point.

28:07.887 --> 28:09.455
Kensi, Deeks, you trail.

28:09.488 --> 28:10.890
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
First off, kid,

28:10.923 --> 28:11.958
you don't give the orders here.

28:11.991 --> 28:12.825
That's right.

28:12.859 --> 28:14.827
We were actually
here before, remember?

28:14.861 --> 28:17.029
Like when you left a man behind?
Hey, you don't go there.

28:17.063 --> 28:18.865
Maybe it's not my
place to say...
Then shut up!

28:18.898 --> 28:20.399
Guys, don't make me
choose sides.

28:20.432 --> 28:21.901
Wait a minute.

28:21.934 --> 28:23.836
What the hell?
Was that necessary?

28:23.870 --> 28:25.337
I'm just impressed you
three can still hear that.

28:25.371 --> 28:27.506
Let's not forget we're here
for the same reason, okay?

28:27.539 --> 28:29.341
Fine. You walk point,
we'll cover our six.

28:29.375 --> 28:30.509
We can take
any tunnels we find.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.078
We're not gonna
find any tunnels.

28:32.111 --> 28:34.146
We might.
We're not going
in any tunnel!

28:34.180 --> 28:35.214
Let's move.

28:35.247 --> 28:37.884
Watch out for booby traps.

28:37.917 --> 28:40.086
My God, this is gonna be great.

28:40.119 --> 28:41.888
Ay-yi-yi.

28:41.921 --> 28:43.890
Bunch of babies.

28:45.925 --> 28:47.326
Do you like whiskey?

28:47.359 --> 28:49.796
Cannot find this

28:49.829 --> 28:51.230
in America.

28:51.263 --> 28:56.068
We try to keep road kill
out of our liquor.

29:21.427 --> 29:23.830
Where is Keane's body?

29:28.868 --> 29:30.937
What does it matter?

29:30.970 --> 29:32.939
He's still with the tiger.

29:32.972 --> 29:34.841
Not much left now.

29:42.481 --> 29:43.282
You're too hard on yourself.

29:43.315 --> 29:45.852
Nobody even knew
he was still alive.

29:45.885 --> 29:47.887
You should drink.

29:50.556 --> 29:53.059
It only gets worse from here.

30:12.411 --> 30:14.613
You mad at me?

30:14.646 --> 30:16.215
Dogs go mad, people get angry.

30:16.248 --> 30:18.350
You angry?
Not really.

30:18.384 --> 30:20.352
I mean, you've done something
I've never been able to do,

30:20.386 --> 30:21.520
so thank you for that.

30:21.553 --> 30:22.388
How's Sydney?

30:22.421 --> 30:24.023
Don't worry about her.
She'll be fine.

30:24.056 --> 30:26.192
How are these
guys doing?

30:26.225 --> 30:28.560
They're on the
move to an isolated area

30:28.594 --> 30:31.363
where Dang, Hetty's kidnapper,
is believed to be,

30:31.397 --> 30:33.465
but we still have no idea
what they're walking into.

30:33.499 --> 30:34.500
Okay.

30:34.533 --> 30:36.502
Where are you going?

30:36.535 --> 30:39.138
I'm gonna see
what I can do.

30:40.907 --> 30:41.773
Enter.

30:41.807 --> 30:44.877
Hi. I just wanted
to personally thank you

30:44.911 --> 30:45.744
for bringing my sister in today.

30:45.777 --> 30:47.646
Well, we could use
a few extra hands,

30:47.679 --> 30:50.883
and she has proven to
be helpful in the past.

30:50.917 --> 30:52.885
And also for
the search warrant

30:52.919 --> 30:55.221
with Hetty's mail--
very helpful.

30:55.254 --> 30:57.523
Great. Anything else?

30:57.556 --> 31:00.392
Do you play poker, ma'am?

31:00.426 --> 31:02.494
No. I don't consider myself
much of a gambler.

31:02.528 --> 31:03.896
I am. Or was.

31:03.930 --> 31:05.564
Until they put me
in the Griffin Book.

31:05.597 --> 31:08.567
Like it's my fault I'm lucky
and exceptionally good at math.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.669
Inconsequential.

31:10.702 --> 31:14.473
The thing is, ma'am,
you're already at the table,

31:14.506 --> 31:16.675
from the moment you provided
plane tickets for the team.

31:16.708 --> 31:18.377
If this thing goes south,

31:18.410 --> 31:20.346
you are most definitely
going to take the fall.

31:20.379 --> 31:21.613
In fact, the only
real chance you have

31:21.647 --> 31:24.550
of surviving this whole thing
is if our team can pull it off.

31:24.583 --> 31:26.585
And that is just
not going to happen

31:26.618 --> 31:28.955
if they have no idea
what the hell they're facing.

31:28.988 --> 31:32.591
So, ma'am, at this point,
I say you go all in.

31:34.126 --> 31:36.162
WOMAN :
Secretary Davis's office.

31:36.195 --> 31:38.264
Yes, I have an urgent call from

31:38.297 --> 31:40.366
Executive Assistant Director
Shay Mosley.

31:46.472 --> 31:49.208
Hold the line
for Secretary Davis.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.211
*

32:16.702 --> 32:18.270
Where's Bridges?

32:18.304 --> 32:20.372
He was right behind me.

32:20.406 --> 32:22.174
You got to be
kidding me.

32:27.013 --> 32:28.647
Man.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.682
What are you doing?
I had to take a leak.

32:30.716 --> 32:32.118
Again?
When you get to be my age, kid,

32:32.151 --> 32:33.452
you'll probably be
wearing a diaper.

32:33.485 --> 32:35.587
At least we won't have to stop
every ten minutes.

32:35.621 --> 32:37.589
Hey, you want to go with me,
Mr. Hippie?

32:37.623 --> 32:39.691
I'm sorry,
did you say "Hippie"?

32:39.725 --> 32:42.294
It's 2018.
You having a flashback?

32:42.328 --> 32:43.662
KENSI: Deeks.
What?

32:43.695 --> 32:45.564
Please.
Both of you, knock it off.

32:45.597 --> 32:47.699
Kensi, fall back
and trail with me.

32:47.733 --> 32:49.068
The rest of you, move on.

32:49.101 --> 32:51.603
All right, moving on.
Come on, Pops.

32:51.637 --> 32:53.572
BRIDGES:
All right, son.

32:55.407 --> 32:58.110
SYDNEY: It has come
to my attention that,

32:58.144 --> 33:03.249
apparently, I can sometimes
come across as a bit abrasive,

33:03.282 --> 33:05.517
and I just wanted to

33:05.551 --> 33:09.288
apologize to anyone I may have
offended with my behavior.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.657
There you have it.

33:11.690 --> 33:15.294
Well, I am sorry
for calling you a bully.

33:15.327 --> 33:17.229
NELL:
And I, too, am sorry

33:17.263 --> 33:20.266
for being overly blunt.

33:22.601 --> 33:24.670
I'm not sorry for anything.

33:24.703 --> 33:26.272
MOSLEY:
Beale.

33:27.739 --> 33:29.641
Can you get this
to our team?

33:29.675 --> 33:30.709
What is this?

33:30.742 --> 33:33.312
The satellite images of
the area you requested.

33:36.348 --> 33:37.749
Thank you.

33:37.783 --> 33:39.585
Alert me before they go in.

33:39.618 --> 33:42.688
Hidoko, with me.

33:43.722 --> 33:44.656
Wow.

33:51.730 --> 33:53.332
Go for Golf Charlie.

33:53.365 --> 33:54.666
ERIC:
Hey, it's me,

33:54.700 --> 33:55.667
Echo Bravo.

33:55.701 --> 33:57.369
Oh, that does sound cool.

33:57.403 --> 33:58.404
What do you got,
Echo Bravo?

33:58.437 --> 34:00.706
The lady in the glass house
has come through.

34:00.739 --> 34:02.108
You should have pictures
of the playground.

34:06.345 --> 34:08.347
How many tangos we talking?

34:08.380 --> 34:10.182
Close to a dozen, from my count.

34:10.216 --> 34:13.719
Thank you, Echo Bravo.
Golf Charlie out.

34:13.752 --> 34:15.821
The safest way to come in
is following this stream.

34:15.854 --> 34:18.690
Gonna get dark soon.
I'll tell the others.

34:26.698 --> 34:28.700
*

34:37.176 --> 34:40.179
It's time.

34:40.212 --> 34:42.214
I'll be right there.

34:54.660 --> 34:56.228
(upbeat pop song playing
in foreign language)

35:27.326 --> 35:28.760
*

35:39.705 --> 35:41.673
One, two, three.

36:11.803 --> 36:13.305
*

36:21.813 --> 36:24.383
Where is she?

36:24.416 --> 36:26.418
*

36:48.307 --> 36:50.609
Harris Keane.

36:50.642 --> 36:52.911
Oh, damn.

36:52.944 --> 36:54.646
You guys got old.

36:56.047 --> 36:58.850
We got Keane. He's alive.

37:32.718 --> 37:35.521
Open your eyes.

37:35.554 --> 37:37.856
Still with us?

37:40.592 --> 37:43.462
I thought you said
she was tough.

37:49.668 --> 37:51.670
I've got it.

38:01.913 --> 38:03.882
Hetty!

38:07.653 --> 38:08.654
Here you go.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.790
Are you okay?

38:11.823 --> 38:14.326
Oh, it's about bloody time.

38:14.360 --> 38:15.527
We got her.

38:24.736 --> 38:26.004
Wow.

38:39.651 --> 38:40.919
You good?

38:40.952 --> 38:44.490
Mm. I am now.

38:45.791 --> 38:48.560
Chopper's five minutes out.

38:48.594 --> 38:51.062
Get Keane on first.

39:09.581 --> 39:11.483
I told you this
was gonna end

39:11.517 --> 39:13.685
with a bullet in your head.

39:15.086 --> 39:17.423
I lied.

39:17.456 --> 39:19.825
I lied.

39:27.966 --> 39:30.436
You're too old, Maggie.

39:30.469 --> 39:32.771
You don't have the stomach
for this anymore.

39:32.804 --> 39:35.574
See you in hell, Dang.

39:35.607 --> 39:37.909
I'll be waiting for you.

39:37.943 --> 39:39.811
Oh, I certainly
hope so.

40:00.632 --> 40:02.601
(Dang screaming,
cell bars clattering)

40:15.881 --> 40:17.182
Hi.

40:17.215 --> 40:18.617
Hi.

40:18.650 --> 40:20.652
Thanks for helping out today.

40:20.686 --> 40:23.889
Oh. Yeah, well,
thank you for letting me.

40:23.922 --> 40:25.023
Of course.

40:25.056 --> 40:26.592
I'm just glad
everything worked out

40:26.625 --> 40:27.626
for Hetty and everybody.

40:27.659 --> 40:28.927
Yeah. Me, too.

40:28.960 --> 40:31.997
Hey, I'm sorry for always
making you be Togo.

40:34.165 --> 40:35.701
Why didn't you say anything?

40:35.734 --> 40:37.669
You're my big sister.

40:37.703 --> 40:39.838
I just wanted you

40:39.871 --> 40:41.507
to spend time with me,
even if that meant

40:41.540 --> 40:43.609
having to play
a dog to do so.

40:45.511 --> 40:46.478
So...

40:46.512 --> 40:48.480
I love you.

40:48.514 --> 40:50.148
I love you, too.

40:54.085 --> 40:56.788
Plus, Togo solved
way more crimes

40:56.822 --> 40:58.056
than Nancy Drew
ever did, so...

40:59.090 --> 41:00.091
Got ya.

41:00.125 --> 41:01.927
Yeah.

41:03.294 --> 41:06.131
Okay.

41:06.164 --> 41:07.132
You out of here?

41:07.165 --> 41:08.767
Yes.

41:08.800 --> 41:09.835
I'll see ya.

41:09.868 --> 41:12.103
See ya later.

41:18.810 --> 41:20.779
Thank you.

41:20.812 --> 41:22.848
HETTY:
You've done more for me

41:22.881 --> 41:26.552
than I can ever pay back.

41:26.585 --> 41:29.588
So the least I can do
is take you home.

41:31.623 --> 41:34.593
I've been in Vietnam
for most of my life.

41:34.626 --> 41:36.161
I...

41:36.194 --> 41:39.264
I-I don't even know
what home is anymore.

41:39.297 --> 41:41.900
It's with us now.

41:41.933 --> 41:43.935
