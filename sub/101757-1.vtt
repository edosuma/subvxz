M_I_SForEver

00:49.981 --> 00:51.283
Ow!

01:58.283 --> 02:00.685
Hello. Didn't see you there.

02:00.718 --> 02:02.955
I knew someone was
after my treasures.

02:02.988 --> 02:05.358
Everyone said I was
out of my mind.

02:05.390 --> 02:09.026
Do I look unstable to you, huh?

02:09.061 --> 02:11.030
Well, I've learned never
to answer that question

02:11.062 --> 02:12.999
when it's being asked
by somebody holding a gun.

02:13.031 --> 02:16.868
Hey, you're that famous
collective collectables guy!

02:16.901 --> 02:18.503
Rations or something like that.

02:18.537 --> 02:19.772
Well, Ashens, actually.

02:19.805 --> 02:21.440
Well, technically Stuart Ashen.

02:21.472 --> 02:23.708
Ashens is like a name
I use in social media.

02:23.741 --> 02:25.977
Kind of a branding thing.
You know, SEO and all that,

02:26.011 --> 02:29.749
but yes, I am a collector
of incredibly rare,

02:29.781 --> 02:32.618
but totally worthless
collectibles.

02:32.650 --> 02:35.387
Whatever, just put
my Delta Attack down

02:35.420 --> 02:38.524
and I might let you
walk out of here alive.

02:38.556 --> 02:41.393
Well, it'd be difficult to walk
out of here dead, wouldn't it?

02:41.426 --> 02:43.495
That game is staying
in my collection.

02:43.529 --> 02:46.032
- It's not yours.
- It bloody is!

02:46.065 --> 02:48.834
It belongs in the Center
for Computing History.

02:48.866 --> 02:51.637
I'm afraid not, Mr. Ashens.

02:51.669 --> 02:52.971
Time to die!

02:55.640 --> 02:56.809
Hello, gentlemen.

02:57.710 --> 02:58.911
Hand it over.

03:00.812 --> 03:02.514
Thank you, Dr. Ashen.

03:03.649 --> 03:04.783
You lose again.

03:16.095 --> 03:18.597
Oh, well, that's gone then.

03:25.037 --> 03:27.506
Ah, where did you
get that gun from?

03:27.538 --> 03:29.475
They're very hard to get
ahold of in this country.

03:29.507 --> 03:30.909
Oh, from my father.

03:30.942 --> 03:33.078
Funny thing,
didn't even have any bullets.

03:33.112 --> 03:35.948
Then why did you
let him take the game?

03:35.981 --> 03:39.085
Oh, just got caught up
in the moment I suppose.

03:40.585 --> 03:43.054
Wait, what was your name again?

03:43.087 --> 03:46.459
It's Ashen, Stuart Ashen.

03:47.425 --> 03:48.126
Whatever.

05:17.616 --> 05:20.686
Whoa!

06:46.203 --> 06:48.306
What did you go and do that for?

06:48.340 --> 06:51.609
- Do what?
- I had it under control.

06:51.643 --> 06:55.547
Stuart, it was just a bit fun. It's nice
for me to get one over you once in a while.

06:55.580 --> 06:56.282
Fine.

06:57.415 --> 07:00.552
- Any new jobs on the go?
- Uh, we've got a Mr. Stockton.

07:00.585 --> 07:03.722
He wants you to locate
a Modular Tatboy 3000.

07:03.754 --> 07:06.558
And we have a Miss Causon
who is looking

07:06.592 --> 07:08.627
for a sticker album
she had when she was 12.

07:08.660 --> 07:10.128
And of course
we've had five calls

07:10.162 --> 07:12.031
from people who want us
to pick up their rubbish.

07:12.063 --> 07:14.833
We really need to change
this company's name.

07:14.866 --> 07:17.669
Are you just saying that because
you want your name on the door?

07:17.703 --> 07:20.339
No. Well, yes.

07:20.371 --> 07:23.842
- I deserve it.
- Look, mate, you're still learning the ropes.

07:23.874 --> 07:26.077
A bit of patience.

07:26.111 --> 07:28.147
Fine.

07:30.215 --> 07:33.585
Hey, uh, can you guys collect
some of my old mattresses?

07:33.619 --> 07:36.789
No, we're a collection
service, not a collections agency.

07:36.821 --> 07:38.624
So, what do you collect?

07:38.657 --> 07:39.892
Collectibles.

07:41.092 --> 07:42.694
There's good money
in rubbish collection.

07:44.328 --> 07:46.264
You should think about it.

07:46.297 --> 07:48.333
Yeah, thanks.

07:58.075 --> 07:59.677
Oh, what are you
looking at there?

07:59.710 --> 08:01.379
Well, I was just doing
a little bit of research

08:01.412 --> 08:03.615
in the University
Library Archive

08:03.648 --> 08:04.983
and I came across this.

08:05.016 --> 08:06.117
It's very strange.

08:07.119 --> 08:11.023
Upright arcade cabinet,
early field vectors,

08:11.056 --> 08:13.825
all prototypes
forcibly recalled.

08:13.859 --> 08:15.126
Is this the Polybius?

08:15.160 --> 08:16.962
Are you researching
the Polybius?

08:16.994 --> 08:19.030
You've heard of the Polybius?

08:19.063 --> 08:21.799
The infamous arcade game that
can control people's minds.

08:21.833 --> 08:23.202
Benny, that's just a myth

08:23.234 --> 08:25.737
gamers tell
to scare one another.

08:25.770 --> 08:27.773
Well, I'm not so sure, Ashens.

08:27.806 --> 08:29.208
I mean,
from my initial research,

08:29.241 --> 08:31.176
it was an upright game
that was released

08:31.208 --> 08:33.645
into arcades circa 1981.

08:33.678 --> 08:36.014
I've heard
this bedtime story, too.

08:36.047 --> 08:38.249
Yeah, the game was strangely
addictive and people

08:38.282 --> 08:40.318
would fight each other
for the next go on it.

08:40.351 --> 08:42.386
And if you got the high score,

08:42.421 --> 08:45.157
you entered
some sort of euphoric trance.

08:45.190 --> 08:46.191
Here, I've got a book on it.

08:48.325 --> 08:50.061
Look.

08:50.095 --> 08:52.864
Dangerous side effects,
strange behavior,

08:52.898 --> 08:55.133
even rumors of some fatalities.

08:56.701 --> 08:58.737
But then the men
in black suits came and...

09:00.272 --> 09:02.074
never heard of again.

09:02.106 --> 09:04.742
People have been chasing
this myth for 30 years.

09:04.776 --> 09:07.146
Look at the amount
of documentation here.

09:07.178 --> 09:08.847
This doesn't look like a myth.

09:10.148 --> 09:11.917
Well, it does seem legitimate.

09:15.454 --> 09:16.388
Hey, check this out.

09:18.856 --> 09:20.792
This must be the bloke
who developed it.

09:30.402 --> 09:31.436
Hey!

09:32.369 --> 09:34.239
where are you going?

09:35.740 --> 09:37.909
Guess bingo night's canceled.

10:07.172 --> 10:09.407
Father, look what I got
at the 50p shop.

10:09.441 --> 10:10.843
Very nice.

10:10.875 --> 10:12.811
Now, sit up and pay attention.

10:14.111 --> 10:16.214
Your father has to go away
for a little while,

10:16.248 --> 10:19.318
but before I do I want
to tell you a story.

10:20.018 --> 10:25.190
A story about your grandfather,
Woodwood Ashen.

10:25.223 --> 10:29.828
In this box
is the culmination of his work.

10:34.331 --> 10:38.269
The Ashen Portable
Mini Electric Organ.

10:39.271 --> 10:44.309
He managed to get it patented,
but all it ever did was this.

11:04.196 --> 11:07.166
He thought he'd make
his fortune from that.

11:07.199 --> 11:09.101
All he ever accomplished...

11:09.835 --> 11:13.372
was leaving your grandmother
and me penniless.

11:13.404 --> 11:17.008
I promised one day I would
make her proud of me

11:17.042 --> 11:22.480
and now I finally created something that
will help me fulfill that promise, but...

11:22.513 --> 11:24.783
it has been taken from me!

11:26.017 --> 11:29.388
I must do everything
I can to get it back.

11:31.422 --> 11:34.158
I want you to have these.

11:34.191 --> 11:38.062
Your grandfather made them
just before he died.

11:38.095 --> 11:40.898
They were supposed
to enable endless free play

11:40.931 --> 11:43.131
on arcade games,
but of course all they ever did

11:43.133 --> 11:45.137
was shorted everything out.

11:45.170 --> 11:48.207
They will serve as a reminder

11:48.239 --> 11:52.510
to focus on things
that really matter.

11:53.878 --> 11:56.382
Now, I must go.

11:58.016 --> 12:00.051
But before I go, remember I...

12:03.120 --> 12:04.122
Remember...

12:06.590 --> 12:11.229
Remember to mow the lawn well
and regularly.

12:11.263 --> 12:14.233
Always use the best lawnmower
you can possible afford.

12:14.266 --> 12:17.036
It's important
for the health of the grass.

12:18.335 --> 12:19.337
Goodbye.

12:21.273 --> 12:22.874
Daddy?

12:36.287 --> 12:38.123
Professor?

12:42.326 --> 12:43.895
Professor?

12:43.928 --> 12:45.463
Don't say a word.

12:53.305 --> 12:54.673
What are you wearing?

12:54.705 --> 12:56.475
It's a migraine machine,
but I'm not sure whether

12:56.508 --> 12:58.643
it creates them or cures them.

13:01.846 --> 13:04.982
Fascinating, yeah,
look, Professor,

13:05.016 --> 13:07.920
please tell me everything
you know about the Polybius.

13:09.220 --> 13:10.955
No, Stuart, no.

13:10.989 --> 13:14.059
Don't even think about it.
It's way too dangerous.

13:14.091 --> 13:15.693
So, the legend is true?

13:15.726 --> 13:17.528
Well, I mean this
is what I've heard.

13:17.561 --> 13:22.033
It was the early 1980s
and video games were exploding.

13:24.335 --> 13:26.003
<i>I don't mean literally exploding</i>

13:26.037 --> 13:28.205
like the rapid exchange
of combustible energy.

13:28.239 --> 13:29.708
I mean economically exploding.

13:29.740 --> 13:31.242
I understand, yeah, yeah.

13:33.043 --> 13:35.047
<i>So,
money was flooding into the market,</i>

13:35.080 --> 13:38.016
<i>and a shady military
organization funded a brilliant,</i>

13:38.048 --> 13:41.585
<i>but psychotic developer
who was developing games</i>

13:41.619 --> 13:44.156
<i>that could exploit
the feelings of players.</i>

13:44.189 --> 13:48.060
You know, a bit like
VR today, only good.

13:48.093 --> 13:51.596
And the prototype
was called Polybius.

13:53.431 --> 13:55.533
<i>There were terrible
side effects,</i>

13:55.566 --> 13:57.369
<i>but the developer wouldn't stop.</i>

13:57.402 --> 13:59.137
<i>He carried on developing it</i>

13:59.170 --> 14:01.440
<i>until the project
was terminated.</i>

14:07.778 --> 14:09.614
<i>He must've been
a complete lunatic,</i>

14:09.647 --> 14:11.616
<i>completely devoid of humanity.</i>

14:11.648 --> 14:14.518
Completely and utterly
inhumanly corrupt!

14:14.551 --> 14:17.989
He must've been
an absolute psychotic monster!

14:18.023 --> 14:21.659
Professor, I think
that man was my father.

14:24.428 --> 14:27.064
I'm so sorry, Stuart.

14:27.098 --> 14:29.534
I'm sure he must've been
lovely in other ways.

14:29.566 --> 14:32.037
He wasn't and I haven't
seen or heard from him

14:32.070 --> 14:34.138
since the Polybius
supposedly disappeared.

14:34.172 --> 14:37.341
Stuart, you've got to let this one go.
It's far too dangerous.

14:37.374 --> 14:40.044
If you find it and fell
into the wrong hands,

14:40.077 --> 14:42.413
it would be very, very bad news.

14:42.446 --> 14:44.383
I think it already has.

14:44.416 --> 14:46.518
From what we found
in the University Archives,

14:46.551 --> 14:50.187
we think the prototype may be
being held in this building.

14:50.220 --> 14:52.056
Which is owned
by Antony Agonist,

14:52.090 --> 14:54.559
a cretin who had the Museum
of Local History demolished

14:54.591 --> 14:57.328
so he could build
his sterile headquarters on it.

14:57.361 --> 14:59.597
I dread to think what he's
got planned for the Polybius.

15:01.199 --> 15:02.234
I really must stop putting

15:02.267 --> 15:03.768
so much of this oil on my hands.

15:05.769 --> 15:07.505
Sorry, you were saying.

15:07.538 --> 15:11.442
Professor, what do you
think I should do?

15:11.475 --> 15:13.110
I'm sorry, Stuart,
I can't tell you that.

15:13.143 --> 15:16.148
You'll have to decide
for yourself.

15:16.181 --> 15:19.785
But, you know, best of luck
saving the world or not.

15:19.817 --> 15:21.419
It's totally up to you.

15:21.452 --> 15:22.653
No pressure.

15:23.555 --> 15:24.723
Thanks, Professor.

15:24.755 --> 15:26.490
Whoa, oh, I'm sorry.

15:30.260 --> 15:31.195
Let me see.

15:39.704 --> 15:42.407
- Hello, Christine.
- Stuart.

15:43.340 --> 15:44.475
Can I come in?

15:46.311 --> 15:48.346
Sorry, yes, of course.

15:53.685 --> 15:57.756
I see you're still
very keen on the old lawnmowers.

15:57.788 --> 16:00.591
Yes, here's my new purchase.

16:00.624 --> 16:04.528
- The Stingray 3000.
- Um, yeah.

16:04.561 --> 16:06.297
Very, very nice.

16:08.332 --> 16:11.269
Look, Chris, I have something
I've got to ask you.

16:12.402 --> 16:14.339
Have you ever heard
of the Polybius?

16:14.372 --> 16:16.175
No, what's that?

16:17.542 --> 16:21.647
I think it was
the project that, um...

16:22.446 --> 16:25.517
that father was working
on before he abandoned us.

16:25.550 --> 16:27.619
Oh, suddenly you're interested

16:27.652 --> 16:30.321
in Dad after all these years.
Why's that?

16:30.354 --> 16:33.657
It's got nothing to do with Dad.
It's purely professional.

16:33.691 --> 16:36.862
He disappeared, I got over it.
You should get over it, too.

16:36.894 --> 16:39.497
How can you still be
so cold about this, Stuart?

16:39.531 --> 16:41.566
Don't pretend it doesn't matter.

16:41.599 --> 16:43.535
I'll never stop trying
to find out what happened.

16:43.567 --> 16:45.903
Look at what it's done to you.

16:45.936 --> 16:48.440
You've got to stop chasing
his shadow, it's pointless.

16:48.473 --> 16:50.775
It's better than
a pointless life, Stuart.

16:55.846 --> 16:57.448
I don't have time for this.

16:57.481 --> 17:00.684
Unlike you,
I'm a very busy person.

17:00.718 --> 17:01.854
I should go.

17:23.640 --> 17:24.909
Thought I'd find you here.

17:26.977 --> 17:27.912
How'd it go with your sister?

17:29.446 --> 17:30.681
Could have gone better.

17:33.350 --> 17:35.686
Do you believe, Benny?

17:35.719 --> 17:38.556
Do you believe
in the legend of the Polybius?

17:38.590 --> 17:40.524
I don't know what I believe.

17:40.558 --> 17:43.628
But if what we found out
about the Polybius is true...

17:44.561 --> 17:45.863
then we have to find it.

17:47.898 --> 17:49.801
And if we do maybe then
you can find out something

17:49.833 --> 17:51.602
about what happened
to your dad, too.

18:00.778 --> 18:04.216
- Let's get this thing.
- Yes, a heist!

18:04.248 --> 18:05.482
- It's not a heist.
- It's a heist.

18:05.515 --> 18:07.319
A robbery, pre-planned

18:07.351 --> 18:09.553
with more than one participant.

18:09.587 --> 18:11.356
It's not
a complicated definition,

18:11.388 --> 18:13.291
but if it ticks both those,

18:13.323 --> 18:15.259
- it's a heist.
- I suppose it is actually, isn't it?

18:15.292 --> 18:17.428
I mean, I did check
the definition last night.

18:17.462 --> 18:18.797
Ah, so cool.

18:22.567 --> 18:24.502
Uh, well, we should
probably go actually.

18:24.534 --> 18:25.669
We've got, like,
loads of stuff to do.

18:25.703 --> 18:26.705
Oh, yes.

18:26.737 --> 18:28.673
Sorry, it's all the drama!

18:31.609 --> 18:32.977
So, according to our research,

18:33.011 --> 18:35.714
after 30 years
of failed development,

18:35.746 --> 18:39.683
what we think could be the Polybius
was sold at a military boot sale

18:39.716 --> 18:43.955
and purchased
by one Antony Agonist.

18:43.987 --> 18:47.424
<i>This guy gives new
meaning to the word egomaniac.</i>

18:47.457 --> 18:49.593
<i>And he seems to
be on some bizarre crusade</i>

18:49.627 --> 18:51.763
<i>against anything
made over three years ago.</i>

18:51.795 --> 18:53.631
<i>The man's bad news.</i>

18:53.665 --> 18:55.667
<i>And now he's pouring
resources into the Polybius.</i>

18:55.699 --> 18:58.702
So the Polybius is secured
in his corporate headquarters,

18:58.735 --> 19:01.372
<i>the Brundall Unconditional
Modernization Building,</i>

19:01.406 --> 19:03.774
and getting it is
not going to be easy.

19:03.808 --> 19:07.012
<i>We're going to have to bypass
six separate security systems.</i>

19:07.044 --> 19:09.046
- <i>Seven.</i>
- <i>Oh, yeah, good spot.</i>

19:09.080 --> 19:14.718
But I think there might be
a weak spot on this west wall.

19:14.752 --> 19:17.955
There's a heating vent here that
isn't secured, guarded or alarmed.

19:17.988 --> 19:21.358
You're right. If we can access
this small thermal exhaust port,

19:21.391 --> 19:22.994
we can get into
the maintenance area here.

19:23.026 --> 19:24.495
It's a heating vent.

19:24.529 --> 19:25.830
Why do they always make these

19:25.862 --> 19:27.532
thermal exhaust ports
so vulnerable?

19:27.564 --> 19:29.366
Again, a heating vent.

19:29.399 --> 19:31.869
Mind you, it might be
quite difficult getting in.

19:31.903 --> 19:34.406
The thermal exhaust port
doesn't look very big.

19:34.438 --> 19:35.606
No bigger than a womp rat.

19:35.639 --> 19:38.042
It's a heating vent.

19:38.076 --> 19:40.845
We're going to need a good crew
on this job. The best.

19:40.878 --> 19:43.682
Eye in the sky,
fixer, grease man,

19:43.715 --> 19:45.382
and a mole if we're going
to get it done.

19:45.416 --> 19:47.686
You forgot the most
important one. The money.

19:47.718 --> 19:49.553
We're going to need
cash for equipment,

19:49.587 --> 19:51.589
transport, craft services.

19:51.621 --> 19:54.024
But who do we know that
can get that kind of money?

19:54.058 --> 19:57.962
Benny, my friend, I think
we both know the answer to that.

19:57.994 --> 19:59.864
- Who?
- Geoff.

20:01.965 --> 20:03.368
Geoff.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.944
Geoff! Are you all right,
what's happened?

20:14.044 --> 20:15.913
It's the germs that you want.

20:15.946 --> 20:18.049
The germs, they're everywhere.

20:18.081 --> 20:19.417
They're in everyone.

20:19.449 --> 20:21.452
What, like cold and flu germs?

20:21.485 --> 20:22.454
No, no, no, no, no, no.

20:23.687 --> 20:25.489
It's the moon germs.

20:25.523 --> 20:27.658
The centium moon germs
from the dark side of the moon.

20:27.692 --> 20:29.728
NASA have brought them back with
them from the first moon landing

20:29.761 --> 20:31.763
in the 1960s and...

20:31.795 --> 20:36.400
Geoff, there's no such
thing as moon germs.

20:38.869 --> 20:40.571
- Really?
- No.

20:42.407 --> 20:43.975
Unbelievable!

20:44.007 --> 20:45.709
Why didn't you tell me
that before, Chef?

20:45.743 --> 20:48.446
I told you 17 times.

20:50.180 --> 20:51.648
Well, I guess that's true.

20:57.754 --> 21:00.157
Sorry, Stuart, is there
something I can help you with?

21:00.190 --> 21:01.692
Actually, yes.

21:01.725 --> 21:03.727
I'm putting together
a crew in order

21:03.761 --> 21:05.864
to steal an old item
of technology.

21:05.897 --> 21:08.733
And I was wondering
if you would like to fund it.

21:08.765 --> 21:12.669
I would love to help,
but I've spent a fortune

21:12.703 --> 21:17.142
on vitamin pills
fighting the moon germs! Oh!

21:17.175 --> 21:18.842
Totally understandable, mate.

21:18.876 --> 21:20.177
Totally understandable
of course,

21:20.211 --> 21:22.480
but just as a matter
of interest.

21:22.513 --> 21:26.417
The item in question
is owned by an Antony Agonist.

21:26.451 --> 21:28.553
Agonist? I hate that guy.

21:28.586 --> 21:30.054
You know, he knocked down
my mother's house because

21:30.087 --> 21:32.023
he thought her thatched
roof had too much thatch!

21:32.055 --> 21:34.191
I'm in, whatever
you need, Stuart.

21:37.561 --> 21:40.732
It's just really great to
come to, uh, places like this.

21:40.764 --> 21:42.667
You know, real down to earth,

21:42.699 --> 21:44.835
soul to the earth
kind of places.

21:45.735 --> 21:49.541
Normally, I go to
the Bellago or the Maribelle.

21:49.573 --> 21:51.542
You know, I'm somewhat
of a high roller.

21:51.576 --> 21:53.478
Super high, actually.

21:53.511 --> 21:56.614
But I like to keep it real,
keep it on the DL.

21:56.647 --> 22:00.484
Keep my feet on terra firma,
if you know what I mean.

22:00.517 --> 22:01.886
Yeah, whatever.

22:03.186 --> 22:05.456
Yeah, it's just, uh, I'm...

22:06.291 --> 22:07.859
You're getting
those drinks, right?

22:10.494 --> 22:11.963
Yeah, of course.

22:11.995 --> 22:13.630
Make mine a double.

22:13.664 --> 22:14.766
Double?

22:25.243 --> 22:29.681
You'll have to excuse me. I've just
seen a high roller associate of mine,

22:29.714 --> 22:34.619
or a high rollass
if we abbrevo in the biz.

22:34.651 --> 22:36.888
I will be right back.

22:41.591 --> 22:44.495
- Jarred.
- Ashens, I'm working here, mate.

22:44.529 --> 22:46.830
I need a smooth man for a job.

22:46.863 --> 22:49.132
Well, you know me,
I'm a real smoothie.

22:49.166 --> 22:51.602
Put a straw in and suck me up.

22:51.636 --> 22:53.071
I've got a good thing
going here.

22:53.103 --> 22:55.172
What did you get off that mark?

22:57.707 --> 22:59.843
Just this packet
of pickled beetroot

22:59.877 --> 23:02.146
cheesy monster crisps.

23:02.178 --> 23:04.248
You can do better.
Are you in out?

23:04.282 --> 23:08.253
- It's a one time offer.
- Hey, did you take my crisps?

23:08.285 --> 23:10.888
Okay, I'm in.

23:10.921 --> 23:11.922
Let's roll.

23:12.956 --> 23:15.025
Step right up, play the game.

23:15.059 --> 23:17.662
Sir, sir, pick a card, any card.

23:17.695 --> 23:19.696
Fancy a game?

23:19.730 --> 23:20.599
Please?

23:22.832 --> 23:26.571
Just so lonely.

23:26.603 --> 23:27.604
Hello, Annalise.

23:27.638 --> 23:30.041
Ashens, fancy a game?

23:30.073 --> 23:32.109
- Go on, go on.
- Oh, okay.

23:32.142 --> 23:34.678
Watch the card.
Oh, where did it go?

23:34.712 --> 23:36.648
If you find the card
you make plenty of money.

23:36.680 --> 23:38.181
Easy as can be.

23:38.215 --> 23:42.052
Yeah, I said I'd treat you
and treat you I shall.

23:42.086 --> 23:44.722
Now, find the queen.

23:44.754 --> 23:46.991
- It's that one. No, it's definitely there.
- No, it's that one.

23:47.023 --> 23:49.593
- I was watching it the whole time.
- It's 100% that one.

23:49.627 --> 23:52.062
Well, I'm sorry,
my friend but...

23:53.997 --> 23:56.867
Oh, how did that happen?

23:56.900 --> 23:58.669
Oh, well, I guess I owe you.

24:01.004 --> 24:02.306
Could you spot me a tenner?

24:02.340 --> 24:04.175
Ashens, are you sure about this?

24:05.074 --> 24:08.679
Annalise, I need
a USB cable that connects

24:08.713 --> 24:09.947
to the old Mini Type B.

24:13.016 --> 24:15.986
- Is that all?
- I also need an AB hybrid adapter.

24:19.756 --> 24:22.626
Oh, she's good. Very good.

24:23.327 --> 24:25.964
Maybe too good.

24:25.996 --> 24:28.899
Annalise,
I'm putting together a crew,

24:28.933 --> 24:31.903
and I need a woman
who knows how to get things.

24:31.936 --> 24:33.071
Can I talk to people?

24:33.103 --> 24:34.939
Yes, yes, you can.

24:35.939 --> 24:36.941
I'm in.

24:39.142 --> 24:40.110
Cheers.

24:42.112 --> 24:43.747
Okay, you good?

24:43.781 --> 24:46.117
- Yeah, you're not welcome here.
- I'm good.

24:48.653 --> 24:50.221
Why are you dressed
like that again?

24:50.253 --> 24:52.857
This saved us
ten pounds in entry fees.

24:52.889 --> 24:54.658
And you just had
that ready to go?

24:55.760 --> 24:58.696
It is I, the dreaded Calibrax.

24:58.728 --> 25:00.631
Please leave a message
and I will...

25:00.665 --> 25:03.368
No, I want Calibare,
not Calibrax,

25:03.400 --> 25:05.102
for my voice message.

25:05.136 --> 25:07.238
Oh, sorry, okay.

25:07.271 --> 25:09.907
Hey, it's me, Calibare smeable,

25:09.939 --> 25:12.142
please be a dear
and leave a message.

25:12.176 --> 25:14.878
No, no, that's
Calibare's early voice

25:14.911 --> 25:17.347
from episode 209 when
he fuses with the hivemind.

25:17.380 --> 25:19.750
No one likes
pre-fusion Calibare.

25:19.783 --> 25:20.885
He's the worst character
in the show.

25:21.985 --> 25:23.388
Do you even watch your own show?

25:23.420 --> 25:25.889
I want post-fusion Calibare.

25:25.923 --> 25:27.859
Look, I just
want satisfaction, okay?

25:27.891 --> 25:31.294
Oh, hey, isn't that
Crewman Simon Tarses

25:31.328 --> 25:34.965
- from the Drumhead episode of <i>The Next Generation?</i>
- What, where?

25:37.201 --> 25:39.737
Sorry, I do this
when I get nervous.

25:39.770 --> 25:42.173
- And thanks.
- No problem, mate. How are you doing?

25:42.205 --> 25:45.743
Ah, well, you know, it's good getting
the chance to meet all the fans.

25:45.775 --> 25:48.378
You know, as a voice actor you don't
usually get a chance to meet them.

25:48.411 --> 25:52.082
I can't possibly imagine
anything worse than this.

25:52.116 --> 25:53.751
It is the worst.

25:53.783 --> 25:55.887
Listen, Ashens,
I can guess why you're here,

25:55.919 --> 25:58.288
but I'm out of the game now.

25:58.321 --> 26:00.691
Come on, Vocal,
you're the best there is.

26:01.826 --> 26:03.094
Not anymore.

26:03.127 --> 26:04.294
That wasn't acclaimed actor

26:04.328 --> 26:06.731
Spencer Garret, you idiots.

26:06.763 --> 26:10.068
Now, do the voice properly.
I've paid three pounds for this.

26:11.099 --> 26:13.236
- I demand satisfaction.
- Are you sure you don't want in on this?

26:13.270 --> 26:16.307
- I'm in as long as we leave immediately.
- Wait.

26:18.876 --> 26:21.079
What are you doing?
Satisfaction!

26:21.111 --> 26:22.781
I want satisfaction!

26:24.314 --> 26:25.882
Satisfact...

26:25.916 --> 26:27.885
Okay, I think that's everyone.

26:27.917 --> 26:30.354
- We're still missing a grease man.
- A grease man?

26:33.057 --> 26:35.293
I know a grease man.
I'll sort it.

26:37.194 --> 26:39.897
And we need an eye in the sky.

26:39.929 --> 26:43.500
Oh, no, oh, no, no, no,
I know what you're thinking.

26:43.533 --> 26:46.003
Absolutely not, not The Cube.
I don't trust him.

26:46.035 --> 26:47.205
I never have and I never...

26:53.543 --> 26:56.880
- Hello, Cube.
- Hello, procrastinator.

26:56.914 --> 26:58.182
You're really late.

26:58.215 --> 26:59.484
Seriously, where have you been?

27:00.251 --> 27:04.155
Oh, God, I wondered when
you'd darken my dawn up again.

27:04.187 --> 27:06.890
Let me guess, you need
a proper eye in the sky

27:06.924 --> 27:08.792
for your Polybius heist?

27:08.826 --> 27:09.894
How did you know?

27:09.926 --> 27:11.462
Don't ask stupid questions.

27:11.494 --> 27:14.465
You know that I know
that you know that I know

27:14.497 --> 27:16.500
that a partridge in a pear tree

27:16.533 --> 27:18.136
is worth two friends in need.

27:19.270 --> 27:21.205
- What?
- You know what I mean.

27:21.237 --> 27:22.840
I never know what you mean.

27:22.872 --> 27:24.542
Look, Cube, I know
we haven't always

27:24.574 --> 27:26.309
seen eye to eye
on jobs in the past...

27:26.342 --> 27:29.546
Well, that's because you are
a complete control freak.

27:29.580 --> 27:32.350
You have archaic plans
and archaic technology.

27:32.382 --> 27:34.885
If you just use my nice
shiny plans and my nice shiny

27:34.918 --> 27:38.089
technology everything
would be so much easier.

27:38.121 --> 27:40.957
- Anything else?
- I hate your general approach to life.

27:40.991 --> 27:43.261
Also, your beard is stupid.

27:43.293 --> 27:45.929
Look, you know what we're after,

27:45.963 --> 27:47.331
and you know what it can mean.

27:51.435 --> 27:54.371
Okay, but I need technology
from the absolute

27:54.405 --> 27:58.309
bleeding edge and I get
to keep all of it when I'm done.

27:59.342 --> 28:00.811
Yay, great.

28:00.844 --> 28:02.112
Just give me a list
and I'll sort it.

28:02.146 --> 28:06.184
Oh, and I want to be
called Cyber Ops.

28:06.216 --> 28:07.484
Don't push it.

28:21.532 --> 28:25.369
Right,
you all know why we're here.

28:25.401 --> 28:28.205
What we're proposing
is very dangerous

28:28.238 --> 28:30.006
and there is
a high risk of failure,

28:30.040 --> 28:33.043
so if any of you
have any doubts,

28:33.077 --> 28:35.246
walk now, no hard feelings.

28:35.279 --> 28:38.616
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, sit down, everyone.

28:38.648 --> 28:40.051
Sit down.

28:40.083 --> 28:42.219
That was rhetorical, come on.

28:43.954 --> 28:45.990
Now, I know many of you
know each other,

28:46.023 --> 28:48.091
but I will be issuing you all

28:48.125 --> 28:50.328
with code names
for security reasons.

28:50.360 --> 28:52.028
You will be Mr. Pink.

28:52.061 --> 28:54.130
Yes, very happy with that.

28:54.164 --> 28:56.167
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Stuart.

28:56.199 --> 28:58.869
You know pink is my favorite color!
I want to be Mr. Pink.

28:58.903 --> 29:00.438
No, you'll be the color
I assign you.

29:00.471 --> 29:02.506
Excuse me, but you promised me
I could be Mr. Pink.

29:02.539 --> 29:04.375
I look fantastic in pink.

29:04.407 --> 29:06.944
No, I'm Mr. Pink.

29:06.976 --> 29:09.312
I'm more Miss Beige.
That suites me better.

29:09.346 --> 29:11.249
Then can I be Miss
Pink because of the whole,

29:11.282 --> 29:14.185
- you know, gender norms stereotype.
- That's enough.

29:14.217 --> 29:16.019
There'll be
no Mr. Pink for anyone.

29:16.052 --> 29:18.121
We'll just use our real names.

29:18.155 --> 29:21.359
Right, let's move on.
Who is this?

29:24.194 --> 29:25.596
Well, this is Yiannis.

29:25.628 --> 29:27.430
- He's the grease man.
- Oh, great.

29:27.464 --> 29:29.267
Hello, Yiannis.

29:33.971 --> 29:35.506
Do you speak any English?

29:36.974 --> 29:39.176
Geoff, where did
you find Yiannis?

29:39.208 --> 29:40.911
In Greece.

29:40.945 --> 29:44.447
No, we needed
a grease man, G-R-E-A-S-E.

29:44.481 --> 29:46.684
Somebody who can get
into difficult places.

29:46.716 --> 29:49.486
Stuart, I'm sure Yiannis
can get into many places.

29:49.520 --> 29:52.023
And what is he wearing?

29:52.055 --> 29:53.490
I lent him one
of Chef's costumes.

29:53.523 --> 29:55.059
Well, why'd you make
me wear that?

29:55.091 --> 29:56.994
- It doesn't make sense.
- Shut up.

29:57.026 --> 29:58.328
Stuart, what is your problem?

29:58.361 --> 30:03.400
Yiannis, Yiannis,
have you understood

30:03.434 --> 30:06.404
anything that's been
said so far?

30:07.437 --> 30:10.307
Uh, you thief...

30:10.340 --> 30:12.409
uh, steal Polybius.

30:12.443 --> 30:15.646
Unbelievable, so the little
English you do know is too much.

30:15.678 --> 30:18.181
Well, welcome
to the crew, Yiannis.

30:18.215 --> 30:20.184
Perhaps we can now finally
get to why we're here.

30:21.385 --> 30:24.955
This is our target.

30:24.988 --> 30:26.056
The Polybius.

30:27.390 --> 30:29.592
The Polybius is secured
in the Brundall Unconditional

30:29.626 --> 30:31.995
Modernization or BUM building.

30:33.696 --> 30:36.367
It has one of the most
intricate security systems

30:36.399 --> 30:40.437
of any research facility
and is owned by Antony Agonist.

30:40.471 --> 30:42.106
What, I hate that guy!

30:42.138 --> 30:44.175
He made me take
all the keys off my keyboard

30:44.207 --> 30:46.276
because they were too clicky.

30:46.310 --> 30:50.114
And here's how we're
going to get it.

30:50.147 --> 30:54.185
My plan is to infiltrate
the BUM with a mole.

30:54.217 --> 30:56.619
By which I mean one of our people

30:56.653 --> 30:58.723
will be working inside
the research facility.

30:58.755 --> 31:02.225
We'll split into two teams
working simultaneously,

31:02.259 --> 31:04.628
coordinated
by our eye in the sky.

31:04.660 --> 31:07.764
Cyber Ops.

31:07.798 --> 31:09.433
Fine, eye in the sky.

31:09.465 --> 31:11.101
We're going full frontal

31:11.135 --> 31:13.037
into the BUM people.

31:13.070 --> 31:15.373
And I wish I'd phrased
that differently.

31:15.406 --> 31:17.707
Anyway, we're going
through the front door,

31:17.741 --> 31:20.778
<i>here we'll need to lift some
names from the daily visitors list</i>

31:20.811 --> 31:23.513
<i>to override the secondary check.</i>

31:26.449 --> 31:29.419
I'm blind, I'm blind!

31:29.453 --> 31:32.389
<i>Then our eye in the sky
will bypass the electrified fence</i>

31:32.423 --> 31:34.425
<i>so our secondary team
can gain access</i>

31:34.457 --> 31:37.527
through this small thermal
exhaust port.

31:41.330 --> 31:43.199
<i>Our mole will then acquire</i>

31:43.233 --> 31:45.536
<i>the Polybius room door decoder
from the lead scientist,</i>

31:45.569 --> 31:47.739
<i>relaying it back
to the eye in the sky.</i>

31:50.240 --> 31:52.076
<i>Then our front door team</i>

31:52.109 --> 31:54.779
<i>will circumvent the fingerprint
and facial recognition systems.</i>

31:56.746 --> 31:58.681
<i>Meanwhile,
our second team will access</i>

31:58.715 --> 32:01.252
<i>the Polybius room
manual override.</i>

32:02.485 --> 32:05.188
Ah, Satan licked my eyes!

32:05.222 --> 32:07.191
<i>Then we'll need to
beat the motion detectors,</i>

32:07.224 --> 32:10.694
<i>making sure not to move faster
than 0.3 miles per hour.</i>

32:14.430 --> 32:16.399
<i>Before finally,
we relay a signal</i>

32:16.433 --> 32:19.637
<i>to our replica door decoder,
accessing the Polybius room,</i>

32:19.669 --> 32:22.105
<i>and securing
the Polybius itself.</i>

32:26.676 --> 32:28.178
My face!

32:28.212 --> 32:30.248
I use that all the time!

32:31.014 --> 32:33.783
Spit in my eyes, spit my eyes!

32:33.817 --> 32:35.453
Spit!

32:37.454 --> 32:38.688
<i>This is impossible.</i>

32:38.722 --> 32:40.791
I'm not going in someone's BUM.

32:40.823 --> 32:43.593
Oh, don't be so negative.
It's not impossible.

32:43.627 --> 32:45.361
We can get into that BUM.

32:45.395 --> 32:48.232
Together we can crack this.

32:48.264 --> 32:50.667
- Is there anything else?
- Yes.

32:50.701 --> 32:52.837
After 30 minutes,
our overrides will reset,

32:52.869 --> 32:55.572
the alarms will go off,
and we'll all be sent to jail for 20 years

32:55.606 --> 32:58.542
- for criminal conspiracy.
- And then they'll release the guard dogs

32:58.574 --> 33:00.477
that are trained
to gnaw on our bollocks.

33:01.278 --> 33:05.083
- We should be okay there.
- Right, well, I'm off.

33:05.782 --> 33:07.551
Yeah, you have my money.

33:07.583 --> 33:10.620
Don't forget to send me
a postcard from jail.

33:10.654 --> 33:11.655
Okay?

33:11.687 --> 33:12.590
Chef.

33:14.524 --> 33:16.127
Ah, man.

33:16.159 --> 33:18.896
Right, let's get to work.

33:30.206 --> 33:32.443
Ah, Crystal.

33:33.776 --> 33:35.446
How's my favorite scientist?

33:35.478 --> 33:37.347
It's Christine.

33:37.380 --> 33:39.216
Actually, it's Dr. Ashen.

33:40.051 --> 33:42.352
As you can see,
we're making good progress.

33:42.386 --> 33:45.455
My father came up with a
directed neuro frequency system.

33:45.488 --> 33:48.658
I've been starting
to understand its functionality.

33:48.692 --> 33:49.760
Dr. Ashen...

33:50.894 --> 33:53.864
I took a big risk
taking on the daughter

33:53.897 --> 33:56.800
of a failure
who made this machine.

33:56.832 --> 34:00.303
Don't make me regret
that decision.

34:01.772 --> 34:03.506
Tell me...

34:03.540 --> 34:05.609
do you have
any brothers or sisters?

34:05.641 --> 34:07.911
I have a brother,
but we don't really...

34:07.945 --> 34:10.715
Let me tell you about
my life, Christine.

34:11.681 --> 34:13.350
I have four brothers.

34:14.284 --> 34:15.319
Four.

34:17.253 --> 34:21.357
All my life
I've had hand me downs.

34:21.391 --> 34:23.827
Hand me downs!

34:23.860 --> 34:28.766
Grubby toys and dirty
and mismatched clothing.

34:28.799 --> 34:32.837
I have devoted my life
to making sure...

34:34.270 --> 34:36.572
that no one
has to feel that pain.

34:37.574 --> 34:40.311
I don't understand.

34:40.344 --> 34:42.413
I have a vision.

34:43.580 --> 34:50.221
<i>The Polybius 2.0 will be
the most addictive game ever.</i>

34:51.121 --> 34:56.427
And alongside the serotonin
pump it straight into the brain,

34:56.460 --> 34:58.362
<i>will be a simple message.</i>

35:00.529 --> 35:01.798
<i>New is good.</i>

35:03.600 --> 35:05.735
<i>New is right.</i>

35:05.768 --> 35:08.004
<i>New works!</i>

35:08.038 --> 35:10.541
<i>Sir,
the technology directly impacts</i>

35:10.574 --> 35:12.576
the emotional area of the brain.

35:12.609 --> 35:14.712
We must be very careful.

35:14.744 --> 35:20.317
It is time to sweep away
the old and bring in the new!

35:22.886 --> 35:26.824
The clock is beeping.
You hear that?

35:26.857 --> 35:29.592
Beep, beep, beep. Oh, it's coming
from there, it's coming there.

35:29.625 --> 35:32.895
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,
beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,

35:32.929 --> 35:36.567
beep, beep, beep,
beep, beep, beep.

35:37.935 --> 35:41.538
<i>We start with reconnaissance.
We need to know everyone</i>

35:41.571 --> 35:43.574
<i>who's coming in and out
of that building.</i>

35:43.607 --> 35:46.277
<i>Most importantly, the identity
of the lead scientist</i>

35:46.310 --> 35:48.411
<i>who has the Polybius
room door decoder.</i>

35:48.444 --> 35:50.913
Okay, so that's the second time
we've seen Mr. Red Shirt.

35:50.947 --> 35:54.285
- Yep, yep.
- It looks like he's jumping up and down.

35:54.317 --> 35:56.352
- Does he need the lou? Oh, genius.
- He needs the lou.

35:56.386 --> 35:57.654
- Those are the toilets.
- That must be the toilet.

35:57.688 --> 35:59.423
- Yeah.
- Oh, this is the most fun

35:59.456 --> 36:00.791
I've had in ages.

36:00.824 --> 36:02.592
Yiannis, how are you getting on

36:02.625 --> 36:05.361
with that Learn English
in Seven Days tape?

36:05.395 --> 36:07.063
Nice to meet you.

36:07.096 --> 36:09.766
Your curtains are beautiful.

36:09.799 --> 36:11.935
Is that real cotton?

36:11.967 --> 36:13.803
- That's pretty good, Yiannis.
- Excellent, yeah.

36:13.837 --> 36:15.472
That's going to be
really useful.

36:18.040 --> 36:19.676
<i>Next,
for Cube's overrides we'll need</i>

36:19.710 --> 36:21.078
<i>to access the service mainframe,</i>

36:21.110 --> 36:22.813
<i>which is located
underneath the building.</i>

36:26.683 --> 36:30.087
Okay, this is the primary communications
hub for the entire building.

36:30.119 --> 36:31.755
We can piggyback
directly onto it.

36:31.788 --> 36:34.090
If we touch the primary,
they'll know we were here.

36:34.123 --> 36:35.692
Like I told you, Ashens,

36:35.726 --> 36:38.729
let's go through
this secondary sub command path.

36:38.761 --> 36:42.999
- It's a low priority system, quiet, accessible.
- There's no need.

36:43.032 --> 36:45.536
Nobody's going to look for
a rootkit until we're long gone.

36:45.569 --> 36:46.804
Yes, they will!

36:46.837 --> 36:48.371
No, they won't.

36:50.806 --> 36:53.109
There, we're in

36:53.143 --> 36:56.714
using my method, I win, ha!

36:56.746 --> 36:59.082
No, we all loser.

36:59.116 --> 37:00.351
Let's go.

37:03.420 --> 37:06.523
<i>Next, we're going to need
our mole doing his mole thing.</i>

37:06.556 --> 37:08.092
<i>Using our computer override,</i>

37:08.125 --> 37:10.360
<i>Cube has secured Jarred
a job in the building.</i>

37:10.393 --> 37:12.729
These are fun, aren't they?
Go up and down.

37:12.763 --> 37:15.132
Oh... that's secure.

37:15.165 --> 37:17.134
Did my job.

37:17.167 --> 37:19.936
I'm going to go
get a cup of coffee.

37:19.969 --> 37:21.871
Black coffee.

37:21.904 --> 37:25.141
- No milk.
- I'm more of a Kombucha tea kind of guy,

37:25.174 --> 37:27.610
but I will have exactly
what you're having please.

37:34.918 --> 37:38.055
I'm watching you. Yeah.

37:43.627 --> 37:44.628
I'm so sorry, mate.

37:46.163 --> 37:47.865
This is my life.

37:51.768 --> 37:54.772
<i>Okay, let's talk it.</i>

37:54.804 --> 37:58.475
So, Cube has some minor
modifications to my plan.

37:58.507 --> 37:59.877
Thank you, okay.

37:59.909 --> 38:02.045
So, as we all know,
Jarred is the mole,

38:02.078 --> 38:04.614
Vocal and I,
we're going to be Cyber Ops.

38:06.049 --> 38:07.985
- Aw, man.
- This is getting sad.

38:08.018 --> 38:10.420
- That's not the name.
- Fine, eye in the sky.

38:10.453 --> 38:13.189
We're in the van. Annalise,
Yiannis, you're going in through

38:13.223 --> 38:16.159
the thermal exhaust port
and you are going to be called

38:16.192 --> 38:18.594
Team Soaring Eagle of Destiny.

38:18.627 --> 38:21.998
Oh, wow, soaring,
eagles, destiny,

38:22.031 --> 38:24.066
they're, like,
my three favorite things.

38:24.100 --> 38:26.103
- It's a heating vent.
- Whatever.

38:26.136 --> 38:28.005
Ashens, you and Benny
are going through

38:28.038 --> 38:31.909
the front door
and you are Team Boiled Celery.

38:31.942 --> 38:34.744
Boiled Celery? Oh, come on.

38:34.777 --> 38:39.850
Celery, uh, is like,
um, dirt flavored soft wood.

38:39.882 --> 38:41.585
Ashens, just own it.

38:41.618 --> 38:43.619
Now, focus, people.

38:43.652 --> 38:45.087
So, are the telephone calls
in hand?

38:45.121 --> 38:47.191
Because as soon as
we take over the system,

38:47.223 --> 38:49.091
all external communications
will be blocked.

38:49.125 --> 38:50.960
I need control
for a couple of seconds,

38:50.993 --> 38:52.562
and no calls are coming in
in that short amount of time.

38:52.596 --> 38:54.097
Okay, but have you
considered that if a...

38:54.130 --> 38:56.166
The plan works!

38:56.199 --> 38:57.801
Stuart, the plan works.

38:57.833 --> 38:59.936
You can't rely entirely
on the technology.

38:59.969 --> 39:01.504
There's more to it than that.

39:01.538 --> 39:02.639
Oh, should we rely
on your technology?

39:02.672 --> 39:04.608
Your archaic eight bit crap!

39:09.246 --> 39:10.481
Sorry.

39:10.514 --> 39:12.516
Fellas, can we just move on?

39:12.549 --> 39:14.650
What about the lead scientist?

39:14.683 --> 39:17.086
The database,
it's 2048 bit encryption.

39:17.119 --> 39:19.522
- It's insane.
- Yeah, get on with it.

39:19.556 --> 39:21.058
No, I don't have
a name for you yet.

39:22.792 --> 39:25.529
If we don't know
who has the door decoder,

39:25.561 --> 39:27.063
we are dead in the water.

39:27.096 --> 39:29.732
No, we'll be alive!

39:29.766 --> 39:32.569
- In jail.
- That's not much better.

39:32.601 --> 39:34.705
Well, you know, it could be,
because with jail you get,

39:34.737 --> 39:37.241
- you know, free food and...
- Communal dining area.

39:37.273 --> 39:39.909
You know, like Wagamamas.
You don't pay rent.

39:39.942 --> 39:41.110
You don't, you don't pay rent.

39:41.143 --> 39:43.212
- I like corn.
- Corn?

39:43.246 --> 39:44.715
- Yeah.
- Do they have corn there?

39:44.748 --> 39:46.083
- You see?
- Probably, yeah.

39:46.116 --> 39:49.719
Uh, I think jail is bad.

39:49.752 --> 39:51.587
- Yeah, yeah, it's no joke.
- Yeah, that's true.

39:51.621 --> 39:53.757
<i>Next, transport.</i>

39:53.790 --> 39:57.860
<i>Nondescript, reliable,
and most importantly, cheap.</i>

39:57.893 --> 39:59.763
So, as I was
saying, my employer would like

39:59.795 --> 40:02.131
to purchase
one of your excellent vans.

40:02.165 --> 40:03.734
- Well, I want to help.
- Mm-hmm.

40:03.766 --> 40:05.569
But I think the best
I can do is 12,000.

40:05.601 --> 40:06.869
Oh.

40:06.902 --> 40:10.940
She sells sea shells
on the sea shore.

40:10.973 --> 40:13.242
Please could you help
us out with the price?

40:13.275 --> 40:16.679
You drive a hard bargain,
but I like you.

40:16.712 --> 40:18.714
- I can drop it to 11.
- What about ten?

40:18.748 --> 40:20.317
No, 11's the best I can do.

40:20.350 --> 40:23.786
Sea shells on the sea shore.

40:23.819 --> 40:25.821
If you can't,
then that'll have to do.

40:25.855 --> 40:28.692
Lovely doing business with you.

40:28.725 --> 40:32.596
You know, you're
a very kind man.

40:32.628 --> 40:35.031
With kind eyes.

40:36.967 --> 40:38.802
Let go!

40:38.835 --> 40:39.770
Ouch!

40:42.605 --> 40:43.873
I think you broke it.

40:43.906 --> 40:45.942
Uh, 14, 14, it's my final offer.

40:50.279 --> 40:52.850
- Let me go get the paperwork.
- Oh!

41:01.223 --> 41:02.892
Who's this?

41:02.926 --> 41:05.061
This is Ryan,
I've known him for years.

41:05.094 --> 41:06.196
Say hi, Ryan.

41:06.228 --> 41:07.964
- Hi, Ryan.
- He's our driver.

41:07.998 --> 41:11.168
He's the best that I know of.
He's got our backs.

41:11.201 --> 41:14.838
I've no idea what's going on,
but I'm okay with that.

41:17.139 --> 41:20.109
Ah, he's very mysterious.

41:20.143 --> 41:21.345
I genuinely don't
care about him.

41:21.377 --> 41:23.813
Right, do we have
my 4K monitors?

41:23.846 --> 41:25.147
Yes, check.

41:25.181 --> 41:27.851
- Do we have my SSD arrays?
- Yep, here.

41:27.884 --> 41:30.821
Uh, do you have my artificial
intelligence risk chip?

41:31.955 --> 41:35.359
No, because you made that up.

41:35.391 --> 41:36.926
How dare you!

41:36.960 --> 41:38.962
You trying to be clever?

41:38.994 --> 41:40.029
A little bit, yeah.

41:40.063 --> 41:41.699
- Didn't work.
- Hang on.

41:44.067 --> 41:45.869
Who the hell are these guys?

41:45.902 --> 41:47.771
Oh, I invited them.

41:47.804 --> 41:49.873
But the plan, Ashens, the plan.

41:49.906 --> 41:51.975
Count us up, plus Geoff.

41:52.007 --> 41:55.344
One, two, three,
carry the two, 11.

41:55.377 --> 41:57.980
Exactly, 11.

41:58.014 --> 41:59.116
So, what? 11.

41:59.148 --> 42:01.685
11, Ashen's 11.

42:01.717 --> 42:05.221
We can call ourselves
Ashen's 11!

42:07.290 --> 42:12.094
Oh, that is so...

42:12.127 --> 42:13.330
cool!

42:13.362 --> 42:15.264
- Yes!
- Yeah, it is!

42:15.297 --> 42:18.901
Totally justifies
the massive extra risk.

42:18.935 --> 42:21.138
Oh, now, see,
that works on so many levels.

42:21.170 --> 42:23.239
Well, it works
on one level, but...

42:23.272 --> 42:24.674
- Oh, yeah.
- That's a good level.

42:24.708 --> 42:26.677
- What a level.
- Level...

42:26.710 --> 42:29.946
Actually, I better find
something for you guys to do, um.

42:29.978 --> 42:33.884
How about you take these,
collect some money to offset

42:33.917 --> 42:36.119
- the cost of the heist.
- That sounds like a lot of fun.

42:36.152 --> 42:37.888
- Let's do it!
- Cheers, guys.

42:37.920 --> 42:39.188
- Bye.
- Bye.

42:39.221 --> 42:40.389
- See you.
- They're so lovely.

42:40.422 --> 42:42.258
I didn't now it was possible

42:42.292 --> 42:44.862
to feel this level of regret.

42:46.730 --> 42:48.298
- Support the heist.
- Pennies in the bucket.

42:48.331 --> 42:50.367
- It's a good cause.
- Support the heist.

42:50.400 --> 42:52.102
Oh, I love a good heist.

42:52.134 --> 42:53.369
Thank you very much.

42:53.402 --> 42:55.138
It's for a good cause.

42:55.170 --> 42:57.006
<i>Next,
we'll build an exact replica</i>

42:57.040 --> 42:58.975
<i>of the motion detector
room so that I can train.</i>

42:59.007 --> 43:00.810
How did you do it?
You're cheating as well!

43:00.844 --> 43:02.913
Oh, don't say that.
Oh, I'm going to say mean things

43:02.946 --> 43:05.047
- about your mom in a minute.
- Your mom is

43:05.081 --> 43:07.084
the nicest person
I think I've ever met.

43:07.116 --> 43:09.085
- She's, like, so kind.
- So nice.

43:09.118 --> 43:11.454
- And very, very slow.
- Where's my head gone?

43:11.487 --> 43:14.390
- There's so much blood, I'm going to have PTSD...
- Slower, slower!

43:14.424 --> 43:15.759
More better.

43:15.792 --> 43:17.360
No more way to say, um.

43:17.393 --> 43:19.929
Your mom's so fat!

43:19.962 --> 43:21.997
Well, she's lost a lot
of weight recently actually.

43:22.031 --> 43:23.967
- Yeah.
- She looks really good for it to be perfectly honest.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.503
Think like a sloth
with the finger,

43:26.536 --> 43:30.240
but not sloth, so maybe
like the broadband,

43:30.272 --> 43:33.910
but not broadband,
the dial-up with...

43:38.514 --> 43:39.850
- It's more like that.
- Hit him I the head.

43:39.882 --> 43:41.150
- Again, no?
- Watch it,

43:41.183 --> 43:43.185
I've seen you before,
you come frozen.

43:43.219 --> 43:44.421
Excuse me!

43:45.955 --> 43:49.192
We are trying
to plan a heist here.

43:49.225 --> 43:50.761
- She started it.
- Yeah.

43:50.793 --> 43:52.027
No, I didn't.

43:52.060 --> 43:53.029
She brought moms up.

43:54.163 --> 43:56.065
Ah, bugger that. Got to
shoot you all in the heads.

43:56.098 --> 43:57.500
- Give me the control.
- Yes.

43:57.534 --> 43:59.469
I haven't got a head,
but I'm still going.

43:59.502 --> 44:01.204
Watch out for her stump,
it's vicious.

44:04.306 --> 44:07.377
<i>Next, we'll have to get
Antony Agonist's fingerprint.</i>

44:07.409 --> 44:10.312
Okay, he's accepted
the invitation.

44:10.346 --> 44:12.114
He'll be here in 30 minutes.

44:12.147 --> 44:13.949
Okay, so let's
go over this again.

44:13.982 --> 44:17.286
This glass has been
covered in a special resin.

44:17.319 --> 44:20.256
We just need him to pick it up,
and then I can lift the print

44:20.290 --> 44:24.127
using this 3D laser scanner.

44:24.159 --> 44:25.529
Bingo.

44:25.561 --> 44:27.397
Bob's your uncle.

44:27.429 --> 44:29.232
The resin degenerates
very quickly,

44:29.264 --> 44:30.833
so I'll be in the van
with a scanner.

44:30.866 --> 44:32.201
Yiannis, you need
to bring me the glass

44:32.235 --> 44:33.470
as quickly as possible.

44:33.502 --> 44:37.106
- Okay?
- Uh, uncle, bingo, Bob,

44:37.139 --> 44:39.475
resin, scanner, yes.

44:41.543 --> 44:44.281
Are you guys sure you can't
pick up my mattresses?

44:44.313 --> 44:47.049
- I'll pay cash.
- Please get out.

44:48.217 --> 44:49.886
It's your loss.

44:57.159 --> 45:03.167
Um, the fox is
in the chicken, uh, house.

45:04.534 --> 45:06.103
Agonist behind door.

45:12.909 --> 45:15.878
Mr. Agonist,
you're extremely early,

45:15.911 --> 45:17.379
but please come in, come in.

45:17.413 --> 45:18.581
How are you doing?

45:18.614 --> 45:20.149
I got your message.

45:21.384 --> 45:25.922
You're demolishing a museum
filled with Byzantine treasures.

45:25.955 --> 45:27.924
- I can't wait.
- Yeah, yeah, it's going to be great.

45:27.956 --> 45:30.426
Uh, would you like
a drink of something?

45:30.460 --> 45:32.295
- A glass of water?
- Water?

45:32.328 --> 45:34.031
Not enough electrolytes.

45:34.964 --> 45:36.465
Water's for losers.

45:42.038 --> 45:43.440
Ah.

45:44.607 --> 45:46.610
A fingerprint reader.

45:49.411 --> 45:50.980
I love these.

45:54.183 --> 45:56.085
I can see
the family resemblance.

45:56.118 --> 46:00.356
Although, your face
is a bit more boring and plain.

46:01.456 --> 46:02.958
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

46:02.991 --> 46:06.362
Christine,
she's your sister, right?

46:07.063 --> 46:09.532
- You know Christine?
- Know her?

46:09.565 --> 46:14.604
She's my lead scientist
on a very important project.

46:14.636 --> 46:16.639
Very hush hush.

46:17.940 --> 46:19.375
I'd like a word
with you in private.

46:19.409 --> 46:20.477
Join me.

46:27.215 --> 46:28.418
Please, have a seat.

46:30.953 --> 46:33.522
Ashens, the reason I'm here

46:33.556 --> 46:37.060
other than to see
priceless artifacts destroyed,

46:37.092 --> 46:40.029
is to talk to you
about your sister.

46:40.063 --> 46:41.264
What about her?

46:41.297 --> 46:43.000
I'd like to get to
know her better.

46:44.534 --> 46:47.470
I thought maybe you could
give me some brotherly advice.

46:47.502 --> 46:49.405
Nope, sorry, I can't help you.

46:50.473 --> 46:52.141
Fine!

46:52.174 --> 46:54.009
I wouldn't normally ask
you, but your father...

46:54.043 --> 46:57.013
Oh, oh, sorry. I'm just getting a call.

46:57.045 --> 46:58.681
Sorry, I've got to take this.

46:58.714 --> 47:01.283
- Oh, hi, Dad.
- <i>Hi, Mr. Agonist.</i>

47:01.317 --> 47:02.719
<i>We need you to move your car.</i>

47:02.752 --> 47:05.188
Yeah, no, I'm just here
with someone, Dad.

47:05.221 --> 47:07.257
<i>Sorry, no, this is the council.</i>

47:07.290 --> 47:11.728
Yeah, no their dad
disappeared over 30 years ago.

47:11.761 --> 47:15.098
- <i>You're confused, I just... What the f...</i>
- Love you.

47:15.130 --> 47:18.000
Sorry, don't know
if you heard, that was my dad.

47:19.168 --> 47:21.238
Who I talk to
on a regular basis.

47:22.304 --> 47:24.239
You know what, I'm bored of you.

47:24.272 --> 47:29.411
I'm going to send you a signed
copy of my third autobiography.

47:29.444 --> 47:32.147
Thanks, this has been great.

47:32.181 --> 47:33.150
Got to go.

47:44.627 --> 47:46.029
Is your sister
the lead scientist...

47:46.061 --> 47:47.163
I believe she is.

47:47.196 --> 47:48.197
And you didn't know that she...

47:48.230 --> 47:49.498
I did not.

47:49.531 --> 47:50.734
Are you just
going to keep cutting off

47:50.766 --> 47:52.168
- everything that...
- I am.

47:53.368 --> 47:54.971
There's something I need to do.

48:02.578 --> 48:04.214
Sorry, what did I miss?

48:05.748 --> 48:09.653
This is, how you say,
a family full of mess.

48:10.685 --> 48:12.488
Yes, it is.

48:27.502 --> 48:29.705
Everything all right?

48:32.141 --> 48:34.778
Stuart, what are you doing here?

48:34.810 --> 48:38.614
I'm going to ask you a question
and I want an honest answer.

48:40.282 --> 48:41.717
Okay.

48:41.750 --> 48:46.455
It's just their shape, you know?

48:46.489 --> 48:48.291
The way they just
cut the grass and...

48:48.324 --> 48:49.793
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

48:49.826 --> 48:51.561
Are you working on the Polybius?

48:52.661 --> 48:54.196
We went through this.

48:54.230 --> 48:55.697
I've spoken to Agonist.

48:55.730 --> 48:57.266
I know everything.

49:01.804 --> 49:04.107
Are you doing this for father?

49:04.139 --> 49:05.475
It won't bring him back.

49:05.507 --> 49:08.411
No, he's been gone for years.

49:12.248 --> 49:14.384
Do you ever think about him?

49:14.417 --> 49:15.585
No, never.

49:16.418 --> 49:18.687
Didn't need him then,
don't need him now.

49:18.721 --> 49:20.322
Why do you always do that?

49:20.355 --> 49:21.257
What?

49:23.426 --> 49:25.494
Why were you speaking
to Agonist?

49:25.527 --> 49:26.562
What are you up to?

49:26.596 --> 49:28.197
Oh, nothing, no reason, no.

49:28.230 --> 49:31.633
But, um, do be careful, Chris.

49:31.667 --> 49:33.168
Fine.

49:33.201 --> 49:36.138
I'll leave you
to your lawnmowers.

49:37.172 --> 49:39.375
What do you mean?

49:47.650 --> 49:48.818
<i>Hello, Science Department.</i>

49:48.851 --> 49:51.221
Yes, it's Dr. Ashen.

49:51.253 --> 49:53.489
I'd like to move forward
with the relocation plan.

49:57.493 --> 49:59.529
Uh, uh, Cyber Ops emergency.

49:59.561 --> 50:00.697
Cyber ops emergency!

50:00.730 --> 50:02.232
Everybody here now!

50:06.235 --> 50:08.304
Norwich, we have a problem.

50:08.337 --> 50:10.306
I've just seen
some serious email chatter.

50:10.339 --> 50:11.641
They are moving the Polybius.

50:11.674 --> 50:13.275
What, when?

50:13.308 --> 50:15.611
Uh, two days from now!

50:15.645 --> 50:18.313
We're going to have
to go tomorrow night.

50:18.346 --> 50:20.649
- I'm not ready.
- I need to finish my training.

50:20.683 --> 50:22.819
This is the only way now.

50:22.851 --> 50:24.253
There's something
not right here.

50:24.286 --> 50:25.487
- What is going on?
- Oh, really,

50:25.520 --> 50:27.223
you're accusing me of this now?

50:27.255 --> 50:28.790
I think it's a possibility.

50:28.824 --> 50:30.592
Everything that's gone
wrong has come through you.

50:30.625 --> 50:32.461
I don't understand.

50:32.494 --> 50:34.330
There's nothing to get
to the bottom of.

50:38.500 --> 50:39.868
Enough!

50:39.902 --> 50:41.438
We can do this.

50:42.938 --> 50:44.206
We're prepared.

50:48.344 --> 50:50.213
At least we know
Jarred's on top of things.

50:58.721 --> 51:00.223
Oh, come on, man.

51:00.255 --> 51:02.824
Get the door decoder, get out.

51:08.496 --> 51:09.765
Oh, my God.

51:09.799 --> 51:11.301
I am so sorry.

51:11.333 --> 51:12.768
Watch where you're going.

51:12.802 --> 51:14.337
Look,
let me help you with these.

51:17.505 --> 51:19.308
What are you staring at?

51:19.342 --> 51:22.212
Um, uh, wow...

51:22.978 --> 51:24.880
Lawnmowers.

51:24.913 --> 51:27.183
Nice, nice.

51:27.951 --> 51:30.719
You know, 68,000 people
are injured every year

51:30.752 --> 51:32.988
by lawnmowers
in the United States.

51:33.022 --> 51:34.657
Fact.

51:34.690 --> 51:38.860
Um, you know,
lawnmowers remind me of,

51:38.893 --> 51:41.598
"It's summer, get out
and cut the lawn!"

51:41.630 --> 51:44.567
"But I'm watching TV, Mom!"
"Get out there!"

51:44.600 --> 51:46.703
"It's not working!"

51:46.735 --> 51:48.770
"You've got to prime it,
you idiot!"

51:48.804 --> 51:50.740
Yeah, clippings everywhere.

51:50.772 --> 51:53.342
Clippings everywhere.

51:53.375 --> 51:55.677
Right, give those to me.

51:55.710 --> 51:56.879
I have work to do.

51:58.581 --> 51:59.883
I hope to see you soon.

52:05.688 --> 52:07.590
You used to be smooth.

52:07.623 --> 52:08.891
That was rough.

52:08.924 --> 52:10.393
What's happened to me?

52:14.797 --> 52:16.532
On the ready line.

52:16.565 --> 52:18.368
Come on, on the ready
line, everybody.

52:24.005 --> 52:29.712
Okay, before we go, I would
like to say a few words.

52:29.744 --> 52:33.382
This is absolutely hopeless.

52:33.415 --> 52:34.883
That's not a good way
to start a speech.

52:34.917 --> 52:37.686
Oh, how I regret my old friend.

52:37.719 --> 52:39.988
Oh, no, that's perfect
for us because we

52:40.022 --> 52:42.324
are absolutely hopeless.

52:42.357 --> 52:43.692
Ah, yeah, much better.

52:43.726 --> 52:45.494
What we are about to do

52:45.527 --> 52:47.763
is often referred to as a con.

52:47.797 --> 52:49.565
Now, what is con short for?

52:49.598 --> 52:51.534
Utter confusion!

52:51.567 --> 52:53.302
Computer output notification.

52:53.335 --> 52:56.938
- Confidence?
- Yes, confidence.

52:56.971 --> 53:01.410
And that is something
we don't have a lot of.

53:01.444 --> 53:04.080
I mean, take a look at us.

53:04.112 --> 53:06.348
We've got Annalise
whose positivity

53:06.382 --> 53:08.784
is bordering on insanity.

53:08.817 --> 53:11.753
We've got Vocal whose constant
voice training exercise

53:11.786 --> 53:13.889
is threatening
to can the whole shebang.

53:13.922 --> 53:16.058
We've got Ryan
who is the only person

53:16.092 --> 53:17.860
I know with a driving license.

53:17.893 --> 53:20.929
We've got Benny
whose irritating curiosity

53:20.962 --> 53:22.931
kicked this whole thing off.

53:22.964 --> 53:25.334
We've got Yiannis,
I still don't really know

53:25.368 --> 53:27.570
if he speaks English or Greek.

53:27.603 --> 53:29.339
Ah, yes.

53:29.371 --> 53:31.840
This is a great pep talk so far,
Ashens, really great.

53:31.873 --> 53:34.409
And of course, Cube,
who once got stuck

53:34.442 --> 53:37.846
at a press any key prompt
because he refused to comply.

53:37.880 --> 53:39.882
That was one time!

53:39.915 --> 53:41.817
And most of all, me.

53:41.851 --> 53:44.753
Some poor prat who turned
his hording problem

53:44.786 --> 53:46.555
into an embarrassing career.

53:47.322 --> 53:49.458
What I'm saying,
ladies and gentlemen,

53:49.491 --> 53:51.560
is that we haven't had it easy.

53:51.594 --> 53:53.463
None of us have been
blessed with good looks,

53:53.496 --> 53:56.898
fancy contacts, or even
competent personal hygiene.

53:56.931 --> 53:58.467
Speak for yourself.

53:58.500 --> 54:00.369
But this is
what makes us stronger

54:00.402 --> 54:01.770
than any other crew.

54:01.804 --> 54:05.708
We are the No Confidence Crew.

54:05.741 --> 54:09.679
We will not be beaten,
we will not be stopped.

54:09.712 --> 54:14.717
And there is nobody else I would
rather do this thing with.

54:14.750 --> 54:17.085
I like that. No Con Crew.

54:17.118 --> 54:19.020
To the No Confidence Crew.

54:19.054 --> 54:20.723
Yeah, it's got
a nice ring to it.

54:20.755 --> 54:22.924
To a bunch of utter losers!

54:22.958 --> 54:25.561
That speech made no sense.

54:25.594 --> 54:28.365
- Okay, let's go, people.
- Woo!

55:09.538 --> 55:10.740
This is so cool.

55:14.643 --> 55:16.212
Okay, Ryan, punch it.

55:24.953 --> 55:29.558
All right, people,
let's get ready to roll.

55:31.159 --> 55:33.495
Annalise, check your camera.

55:35.831 --> 55:36.966
I think you just broke that.

55:36.998 --> 55:38.701
Yes, that's broken. Ditch that.

55:49.944 --> 55:55.884
Okay, Team Soaring Eagle
of Destiny go to work.

55:55.918 --> 55:57.887
You guys got this.

55:57.920 --> 56:00.690
I just love
those three things so much.

56:00.723 --> 56:01.724
Commencement.

56:11.000 --> 56:16.205
Okay, here we go.

56:16.237 --> 56:19.074
I am in the system
and taking over

56:19.107 --> 56:24.246
the telephoney and the cameras
in three, two, one.

56:25.281 --> 56:27.650
The clock is now ticking.

56:27.683 --> 56:30.652
You've got 30 minutes
to get in, get the package,

56:30.685 --> 56:32.621
and get out before
the system resets

56:32.654 --> 56:35.023
and you're all caught on CCTV.

56:35.056 --> 56:38.727
Now, let's see what we can see.

56:43.898 --> 56:45.067
Good evening, sirs.

56:45.100 --> 56:46.569
Names please.

56:46.601 --> 56:49.638
Okay, switching to shelf cam.

56:49.672 --> 56:52.909
Uh, yes, we're here
to see Dr. Christine Ashen.

56:52.942 --> 56:54.710
Okay, name please?

56:54.743 --> 56:57.980
Zooming, zooming.

56:58.013 --> 56:59.648
Oh, come on, move that paper!

57:01.650 --> 57:03.985
- Name please?
- <i>Guys, the newspaper is blocking the list.</i>

57:04.018 --> 57:07.122
<i>I repeat, the newspaper
is blocking the list.</i>

57:07.156 --> 57:10.092
Yes, we're scientists.

57:10.125 --> 57:11.060
From Sweden.

57:14.029 --> 57:15.931
Sweden, yes.

57:15.964 --> 57:18.333
Fish, fishes.

57:18.366 --> 57:21.603
Ah, that's well and good, sir,
but I'm going to need a name please.

57:21.636 --> 57:23.705
<i>Just say something.</i>

57:23.739 --> 57:24.641
<i>Anything!</i>

57:25.607 --> 57:26.875
Sweden.

57:26.909 --> 57:30.746
Yes, my name
is a series of words

57:30.779 --> 57:36.719
which are preciously
Dr. Steve Wedding.

57:36.752 --> 57:39.322
Yes, Dr. Steve Wedding.

57:41.123 --> 57:43.726
<i>Ah, Jesus Christ.</i>

57:43.759 --> 57:45.027
I'll check the list.

57:48.063 --> 57:50.900
Oh, Dr. Wedding.
Yes, you're on the list.

57:50.933 --> 57:52.701
If you'd like
to step forward to the camera.

57:54.869 --> 57:56.906
<i>Team Soaring Eagle of
Destiny, do you read me?</i>

57:56.938 --> 57:58.239
We're in position.

57:58.272 --> 58:02.110
I am turning off
the electricity... now.

58:10.018 --> 58:12.655
<i>Yes, hello, this is Desk Alpha,</i>

58:12.688 --> 58:16.225
<i>I'm calling to confirm
visitor Dr. Wedding.</i>

58:16.257 --> 58:19.027
Yes, Desk Alpha,
I have your image.

58:19.060 --> 58:23.264
I can confirm identity
of Steve Wedding and guest.

58:23.297 --> 58:25.301
Access is authorized.

58:25.333 --> 58:27.736
- That checks out, sir.
- Yes.

58:27.770 --> 58:29.972
Here are your passes. If you'd
like to go down the corridor

58:30.005 --> 58:31.975
on the left and up
on to the fourth floor.

58:33.409 --> 58:34.677
Fish.

58:37.311 --> 58:39.415
Something ain't right
about them.

58:39.447 --> 58:42.317
I can smell it.

58:42.351 --> 58:44.387
You said that four times today.

58:44.420 --> 58:45.921
Nah, this time's different.

58:45.953 --> 58:47.322
You said that three times.

58:47.355 --> 58:50.359
Oh, there's trouble brewing.

58:51.393 --> 58:55.130
Or my name ain't Jake Steel.

58:55.163 --> 58:57.667
Your name isn't
Jake Steel, it's Kevin.

58:59.400 --> 59:00.636
It's Kevin.

59:03.205 --> 59:05.174
<i>Team Boiled Celery,
gear up and start making</i>

59:05.206 --> 59:07.676
<i>your way down
to the Polybius room.</i>

59:07.710 --> 59:10.346
I hate this jumper, it's like
I have sandpaper on my nipples.

59:10.378 --> 59:12.313
- Tell me about it.
- <i>Okay,</i>

59:12.346 --> 59:15.083
let's switch the phones
back to local control.

59:16.819 --> 59:19.087
Uh, here we go again.

59:19.121 --> 59:22.291
Ah, Vocal, I can't disconnect the
call override without raising alarms.

59:22.324 --> 59:25.127
If that phone rings,
you have to answer it.

59:25.159 --> 59:27.163
- Okay, gotcha.
- It'll be fine.

59:27.196 --> 59:29.297
The phone's not going to ring.

59:29.331 --> 59:33.335
Uh, it's Andrienna
Cavachuti from accounting.

59:33.368 --> 59:34.703
She's calling a pharmacist.

59:37.072 --> 59:39.407
I think this might be your bag.

59:39.440 --> 59:40.810
They're my heist pants.

59:41.810 --> 59:44.714
Um, hello there,
Amblem Pharmacy.

59:44.746 --> 59:46.415
How can I help you?

59:46.447 --> 59:49.118
Um, yeah, can I just pop you
on hold there, Miss Cavachuti?

59:49.150 --> 59:50.853
Line two, John from HR.

59:50.886 --> 59:52.755
He's calling his wife.

59:52.788 --> 59:55.491
- Hello, dear.
- No, she's older than that.

59:55.523 --> 59:58.426
- Hello, dear.
- She's not that old.

59:58.460 --> 01:00:00.295
Hello, dear.

01:00:00.328 --> 01:00:03.732
Why not, I'll meet
down at the park.

01:00:03.766 --> 01:00:05.735
Got the pups out the rain.

01:00:05.768 --> 01:00:07.804
Team Soaring Eagle of Destiny,
do you read me?

01:00:14.877 --> 01:00:16.911
Um, there are no, um, what...

01:00:16.944 --> 01:00:17.912
- Screws?
- No.

01:00:17.946 --> 01:00:19.047
Let me have a go.

01:00:20.047 --> 01:00:21.783
Okay.

01:00:21.817 --> 01:00:23.186
You can do this.

01:00:39.168 --> 01:00:41.403
Well, that was great.

01:00:41.435 --> 01:00:44.039
No, thermal exhaust port.

01:00:45.239 --> 01:00:46.542
Let's go.

01:00:50.978 --> 01:00:53.549
Now,
Mr. Peterson, your colonoscopy

01:00:53.581 --> 01:00:55.518
has been moved to Tuesday.

01:00:55.551 --> 01:00:58.520
You actually have yoga tomorrow.

01:00:58.554 --> 01:01:01.991
Team Boiled Celery, walk
straight up to the scanner.

01:01:08.596 --> 01:01:10.965
<i>Greetings, Antony Agonist.</i>

01:01:10.998 --> 01:01:12.868
<i>What fantastic hands you have.</i>

01:01:16.839 --> 01:01:19.074
Okay, we're in.

01:01:19.107 --> 01:01:20.909
Are you sure
this is going to work?

01:01:20.942 --> 01:01:22.444
<i>Well,
their facial topography system</i>

01:01:22.476 --> 01:01:24.312
<i>is a little iffy, but I think</i>

01:01:24.346 --> 01:01:26.849
the hack of the face
database has worked.

01:01:26.882 --> 01:01:30.787
Don't bother, Cube, I've got a
nice dependable low-tech solution.

01:01:32.487 --> 01:01:34.857
What are you doing?
Follow my plan!

01:01:36.924 --> 01:01:38.927
<i>Identity confirmed.</i>

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:41.930
<i>Your face looks amazing,
Antony. Really great.</i>

01:01:41.964 --> 01:01:44.500
Unbelievable.

01:01:44.532 --> 01:01:47.302
Yes, I had an accident.

01:01:47.335 --> 01:01:49.138
No, it was my fault.

01:01:49.170 --> 01:01:51.506
I really did a really bad one.

01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:53.042
I did a boo boo.

01:01:53.074 --> 01:01:55.377
Okay, we are still
waiting on Jarred.

01:01:55.409 --> 01:01:57.112
<i>What is taking him so long?</i>

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:00.148
Come on, man.

01:02:00.181 --> 01:02:02.183
You can do this. Come on.

01:02:02.217 --> 01:02:05.054
Blue skies in.

01:02:07.989 --> 01:02:10.091
Gray skies out.

01:02:11.326 --> 01:02:12.561
I'm going in.

01:02:17.065 --> 01:02:19.068
- Hello?
- Jarred.

01:02:20.034 --> 01:02:23.638
What can I do for you, Jarred?

01:02:23.672 --> 01:02:25.340
Well, I was just wondering...

01:02:26.475 --> 01:02:30.246
what... um, how, how's it going?

01:02:31.246 --> 01:02:33.182
I'm well.

01:02:33.214 --> 01:02:34.149
How are you?

01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:37.085
A bit plugged up actually.

01:02:37.118 --> 01:02:40.288
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

01:02:40.322 --> 01:02:42.191
No, I'm sorry.

01:02:42.223 --> 01:02:44.993
Why does my mouth
and brain not work together?

01:02:45.027 --> 01:02:47.897
Listen, if there
isn't anything else,

01:02:47.929 --> 01:02:49.498
I have work to do.

01:02:49.531 --> 01:02:51.166
I know what you're saying, Pat,

01:02:51.199 --> 01:02:53.101
but you really need to
just take a step back

01:02:53.134 --> 01:02:55.536
and have a look at it
from her perspective.

01:02:55.569 --> 01:02:57.138
You know what I mean like?

01:02:57.172 --> 01:03:00.175
Come on, Jarred.
You are the sweatiest,

01:03:00.208 --> 01:03:02.278
slickest man I've ever met.

01:03:02.310 --> 01:03:03.411
<i>You can do this, mate.</i>

01:03:04.313 --> 01:03:05.948
Okay.

01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:10.118
I could leave
or I could stay here...

01:03:11.185 --> 01:03:12.220
and talk to you more.

01:03:13.455 --> 01:03:15.456
And what do we have
to talk about?

01:03:15.489 --> 01:03:19.694
Well, I want to talk to you
about that beautiful...

01:03:19.728 --> 01:03:22.431
hunk of machinery
on the wall over there.

01:03:25.032 --> 01:03:26.301
You like lawnmowers?

01:03:26.335 --> 01:03:27.670
Are you kidding me?

01:03:27.703 --> 01:03:29.438
I love a lawnmower!

01:03:29.471 --> 01:03:32.608
Man, a bit of
a collector actually, yeah.

01:03:32.641 --> 01:03:35.377
Got quite a few
interesting pieces.

01:03:35.409 --> 01:03:37.013
Tell me about your piece.

01:03:38.045 --> 01:03:40.248
I mean, your lawnmower pieces.

01:03:40.281 --> 01:03:44.118
Well, I'd have to say
my favorite would have to be

01:03:44.152 --> 01:03:47.690
The Grassinator X98 Titanium.

01:03:48.489 --> 01:03:51.192
There's just nothing better
than a ride-on mower, is there?

01:03:51.226 --> 01:03:53.128
No, there isn't.

01:03:54.261 --> 01:03:56.331
Sometimes I just feel
it, you know?

01:03:56.364 --> 01:03:59.734
Just getting your leg over,

01:03:59.768 --> 01:04:04.340
and then I take my time,
slowly easing into

01:04:04.373 --> 01:04:08.010
that triple sprung
cushioned seat.

01:04:08.043 --> 01:04:11.981
Nestle myself right in,
becoming one with it, you know?

01:04:12.014 --> 01:04:15.050
<i>Easing myself in there.</i>

01:04:15.083 --> 01:04:19.355
Getting comfortable
and then when I'm ready...

01:04:20.221 --> 01:04:25.694
I turn on the engine and I feel
the rumbling underneath me.

01:04:25.726 --> 01:04:30.031
Oh, the purring of potential.

01:04:30.065 --> 01:04:33.068
- Oh, can you imagine that?
- Yes.

01:04:33.101 --> 01:04:39.041
Well, now, imagine me putting
my foot on the pedal gently,

01:04:39.074 --> 01:04:42.543
just to help the engine warm up.

01:04:42.576 --> 01:04:45.346
Then when it's ready,

01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:47.583
I'm going to put
the pedal to the metal,

01:04:47.616 --> 01:04:51.987
and I'm going to mow that lawn.

01:04:55.123 --> 01:04:57.726
Oh, man. Woo!

01:04:57.759 --> 01:05:02.197
Now that is what
I call satisfaction.

01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:04.400
Jarred, what are
you doing later?

01:05:04.433 --> 01:05:07.369
Anything
you want me to.

01:05:07.402 --> 01:05:10.572
Good man, Jarred. Well done.

01:05:10.605 --> 01:05:12.541
Okay, we have to get
him out of there.

01:05:12.574 --> 01:05:15.077
Can I put you on hold for
a minute there, Mr. Lawson?

01:05:15.110 --> 01:05:17.546
I'm just going to call the hotel
in Lanzerotti on your behalf.

01:05:19.214 --> 01:05:20.782
Excuse me one second.

01:05:20.815 --> 01:05:22.384
You're needed downstairs.

01:05:22.417 --> 01:05:24.219
I'm so sorry, I've got to go.

01:05:24.252 --> 01:05:26.188
Security never takes a day off.

01:05:27.389 --> 01:05:29.324
But I hope to see you soon.

01:05:29.357 --> 01:05:32.561
Yes, very soon.

01:05:32.594 --> 01:05:33.561
Yeah.

01:05:35.297 --> 01:05:36.331
Yeah.

01:05:39.333 --> 01:05:40.636
<i>Okay, get that over to Yiannis.</i>

01:05:40.668 --> 01:05:42.804
<i>You have t-minus 20 minutes.</i>

01:05:42.837 --> 01:05:44.806
I'm on my way.

01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:48.409
Oh, wait a minute.

01:05:48.442 --> 01:05:50.245
Relocating the Polybius?

01:05:51.413 --> 01:05:53.782
Who authorized this?

01:05:53.815 --> 01:05:55.217
I'm going for a walk.

01:05:56.518 --> 01:05:58.753
My instinct's twitching
something fierce.

01:05:58.786 --> 01:06:00.522
I bet it is.

01:06:00.554 --> 01:06:02.590
Uh-uh. Where is he going?

01:06:02.623 --> 01:06:05.326
Wait up, wait up, I'm coming.

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:07.463
Get this to The Cube, ASAP.

01:06:07.496 --> 01:06:09.398
I will make
this occurrence happen.

01:06:10.197 --> 01:06:12.801
- Christine.
- <i>I told you, it's Dr. Ashen.</i>

01:06:12.833 --> 01:06:14.802
What do you want, I'm very busy.

01:06:14.835 --> 01:06:17.105
What's this about
moving the Polybius?

01:06:17.139 --> 01:06:20.609
Yes, I have some concerns about
security in the Polybius room.

01:06:20.641 --> 01:06:21.576
Let's go.

01:06:21.610 --> 01:06:24.880
Explain. No, show me.

01:06:24.913 --> 01:06:26.315
I'll see you there.

01:06:28.183 --> 01:06:30.453
Look sharp, guys.
You got company coming your way.

01:06:40.795 --> 01:06:43.764
- What are they doing here?
- I don't know.

01:06:43.797 --> 01:06:46.868
My cowboy sense is tingling.

01:06:46.902 --> 01:06:48.770
Kevin, can we just go back?

01:06:48.802 --> 01:06:50.538
Not until
we've checked this area.

01:06:55.210 --> 01:06:56.244
Clear!

01:06:57.811 --> 01:06:59.147
Unbelievable.

01:07:00.415 --> 01:07:03.351
Jarred and Annalise,
there's no way you're making it

01:07:03.384 --> 01:07:05.419
to the override with
those two hanging around.

01:07:05.453 --> 01:07:07.889
You need to deal with them and you're
going to need to do it quickly.

01:07:09.456 --> 01:07:11.493
Count to 30 and then
distract the guard.

01:07:11.525 --> 01:07:14.529
- What are you going to do?
- Something I saw in a movie once.

01:07:14.563 --> 01:07:15.831
There's movies about ironing?

01:07:21.969 --> 01:07:24.505
Oh, good job, Yiannis.

01:07:24.538 --> 01:07:27.542
- Yes.
- Okay, I go walking

01:07:27.576 --> 01:07:29.811
- and be outlook.
- Lookout.

01:07:32.681 --> 01:07:34.449
Ah.

01:07:40.322 --> 01:07:42.357
<i>Now, the motion detectors.</i>

01:07:42.389 --> 01:07:45.627
<i>Okay, gentlemen, the code
should be on the door.</i>

01:07:45.659 --> 01:07:48.196
It's all Greek to me.

01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:49.731
That's not helpful, Ashens.

01:07:49.764 --> 01:07:50.799
No, literally.

01:07:51.799 --> 01:07:53.735
This is the most
bizarre security system.

01:07:54.868 --> 01:07:56.270
Yiannis!

01:07:56.304 --> 01:07:57.439
Cube, get Yiannis!

01:07:58.505 --> 01:08:01.743
I do not believe your
free market is truly free.

01:08:01.775 --> 01:08:04.779
- Sorry, give us a sec.
- I'll go find him.

01:08:04.813 --> 01:08:07.883
Your food is unoriginal
and derivative.

01:08:07.915 --> 01:08:10.251
One time we need him.

01:08:10.284 --> 01:08:11.420
Cube, hurry up!

01:08:11.453 --> 01:08:13.788
Don't worry, I'm on it.

01:08:13.822 --> 01:08:15.390
Vocal, hurry!

01:08:15.422 --> 01:08:17.658
Come on, guys,
the clock is ticking.

01:08:17.691 --> 01:08:19.993
He's here, he's here, he's here.

01:08:20.027 --> 01:08:21.328
Yiannis, what does this say?

01:08:23.497 --> 01:08:26.768
Uh, turn the handle
left to open.

01:08:29.337 --> 01:08:30.238
What?

01:08:35.843 --> 01:08:39.247
Well, that was a lot less
complicated than I anticipated.

01:08:39.279 --> 01:08:39.981
Yes.

01:08:41.715 --> 01:08:44.719
Guys, guys, over here!
I need your help!

01:08:44.752 --> 01:08:46.388
Wait, wait, wait,
something's not right.

01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:48.322
- I'm going to call this in.
- Don't you dare!

01:08:48.356 --> 01:08:50.425
This is my bust
and I ain't giving

01:08:50.457 --> 01:08:53.295
anyone else the credit
for taking it down.

01:08:53.328 --> 01:08:54.795
Kevin, don't go in there.

01:08:54.828 --> 01:08:58.767
It's Jake, Jake Steel.

01:09:00.401 --> 01:09:03.703
I'm a security expert
trained in two martial arts.

01:09:03.737 --> 01:09:06.340
I got the reflexes of a ninja,

01:09:06.374 --> 01:09:09.877
the stealth of a cat,
and clean CRB check.

01:09:16.685 --> 01:09:18.419
Oh, God, Kevin.

01:09:18.453 --> 01:09:20.621
Oh, what did you just do?

01:09:20.654 --> 01:09:23.692
Oh, that didn't happen
in the movie.

01:09:23.725 --> 01:09:24.892
- Ah, let's get out of here.
- Yeah, okay.

01:09:24.926 --> 01:09:26.527
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:28.663
<i>We need to get
this override pulled now</i>

01:09:28.696 --> 01:09:30.331
or this will all fall apart.

01:09:30.365 --> 01:09:32.734
Jake, I mean Kevin.

01:09:32.767 --> 01:09:34.636
Oh, that's not good.

01:09:34.669 --> 01:09:35.737
This?

01:09:35.770 --> 01:09:38.406
Oh, it's nothing.

01:09:38.439 --> 01:09:39.840
Just a flesh wound.

01:09:39.874 --> 01:09:42.544
Ah, I got worse in 'Nam.

01:09:42.576 --> 01:09:44.078
You didn't serve in Vietnam.

01:09:44.111 --> 01:09:48.350
No, Nam,
my local Vietnamese restaurant.

01:09:48.383 --> 01:09:50.786
I've had food poisoning
there multiple times.

01:09:50.819 --> 01:09:53.455
- I'm going to call an ambulance.
- Not necessary.

01:09:53.487 --> 01:09:55.691
- I'll be fine.
- Okay, let's get you up,

01:09:55.723 --> 01:09:57.491
and we'll get you
a first aid kit.

01:09:57.525 --> 01:09:58.594
Sounds good...

01:10:00.527 --> 01:10:01.597
partner.

01:10:10.437 --> 01:10:12.641
Okay, now...

01:10:13.741 --> 01:10:15.744
focus, Stuart.

01:10:15.776 --> 01:10:17.346
You can do this.

01:10:17.379 --> 01:10:19.581
Take a deep breath,
take your time.

01:10:20.647 --> 01:10:21.816
Don't take too much time.

01:10:23.517 --> 01:10:25.453
What I'm trying to say
is take exactly

01:10:25.486 --> 01:10:27.422
the right amount of time.

01:10:28.722 --> 01:10:31.759
Not too slow, but then
again, not too fast.

01:10:32.459 --> 01:10:37.365
Don't rush, but also make sure
you don't dilly dally.

01:10:37.398 --> 01:10:38.967
You'll only get
one chance to do this.

01:10:39.901 --> 01:10:41.937
No pressure.

01:10:52.414 --> 01:10:55.084
You've started well.
You've got ages to go though.

01:10:56.584 --> 01:10:59.588
You're the slowest
man I know, Ashens.

01:11:00.621 --> 01:11:02.090
<i>Slower, Ashens.</i>

01:11:04.558 --> 01:11:10.965
Slower...

01:11:10.999 --> 01:11:14.102
Ashens.

01:11:14.134 --> 01:11:17.004
I believe in you, Stuart.
I'll support you always,

01:11:17.038 --> 01:11:19.941
except in certain legal
eventualities.

01:11:19.973 --> 01:11:22.110
You're not helping.

01:11:22.142 --> 01:11:25.780
You're almost there now,
but you could still screw it up real bad.

01:11:25.813 --> 01:11:27.516
Really not helping.

01:11:35.088 --> 01:11:37.058
<i>Lasers deactivated.</i>

01:11:38.526 --> 01:11:39.828
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

01:11:39.861 --> 01:11:41.596
<i>Fantastic!</i>

01:11:41.629 --> 01:11:43.565
<i>Now, Soaring Eagles,
just pull the override</i>

01:11:43.597 --> 01:11:46.066
<i>and we'll be able to
remotely hot wire that door.</i>

01:11:47.936 --> 01:11:49.804
We have liftoff.

01:11:49.838 --> 01:11:51.072
- Yes.
- Nice!

01:11:55.677 --> 01:11:57.646
We are in position.

01:11:57.678 --> 01:11:59.447
<i>All right, Ashens,
I am sending you the signal now.</i>

01:12:02.650 --> 01:12:04.719
Say again, please repeat.

01:12:04.752 --> 01:12:06.187
Where is that coming from?

01:12:06.221 --> 01:12:08.089
I've isolated
all possible sources.

01:12:12.727 --> 01:12:14.029
Sorry.

01:12:14.062 --> 01:12:15.497
Okay, Ashens,
I'm sending the signal

01:12:15.530 --> 01:12:17.898
through... now.

01:12:24.873 --> 01:12:27.075
<i>Proceed with extreme caution.</i>

01:12:28.942 --> 01:12:29.911
Shall we?

01:12:33.681 --> 01:12:35.951
How dare she move
the Polybius without me.

01:12:35.984 --> 01:12:37.585
How dare she!

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:53.669
Give me a second here.

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:07.215
Hi, I'm Stuart.

01:13:08.749 --> 01:13:10.118
I think you've been
expecting me.

01:13:14.321 --> 01:13:16.525
So, you're
Father's favorite child?

01:13:18.959 --> 01:13:20.628
You don't look so great to me.

01:13:29.670 --> 01:13:32.039
- Ashens?
- Oh, oh, sorry.

01:13:32.072 --> 01:13:33.674
How long have you been there?

01:13:35.109 --> 01:13:36.977
I came into the room with you.

01:13:37.011 --> 01:13:38.580
I mean, I've been here
the whole time.

01:13:38.612 --> 01:13:39.880
I was standing just there.

01:13:39.914 --> 01:13:41.715
I mean,
I was a couple steps back.

01:13:41.749 --> 01:13:44.119
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- How long have we been in the room?

01:13:44.151 --> 01:13:45.819
- Five or ten.
- Well, that's how long

01:13:45.852 --> 01:13:47.721
I've been, I've been
here as long as we've,

01:13:47.754 --> 01:13:49.056
because we came in
together when...

01:13:49.089 --> 01:13:50.758
Sorry, sorry.

01:13:52.293 --> 01:13:53.562
Let's get this thing.

01:13:55.597 --> 01:13:57.632
Uh, just tip it
towards you, yep.

01:13:57.664 --> 01:14:00.000
- Okay, to me.
- Three, two, one, go!

01:14:05.673 --> 01:14:06.708
I can't.

01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:08.176
Oh, oh, that ain't moving.

01:14:10.745 --> 01:14:13.748
So, I've noticed
a flaw in our plan.

01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:14.982
Yeah.

01:14:15.016 --> 01:14:16.985
Give me
your screwdriver.

01:14:17.884 --> 01:14:18.920
Cheers.

01:14:21.021 --> 01:14:22.256
- What are you doing?
- Hang on.

01:14:22.289 --> 01:14:23.958
Yes, right here. Ah.

01:14:27.861 --> 01:14:30.831
This is all we need. The rest
are just standard components,

01:14:30.865 --> 01:14:33.735
but this
is the key to everything.

01:14:34.802 --> 01:14:36.170
Good thinking.

01:14:37.672 --> 01:14:39.674
The eagle is in the nest.

01:14:39.706 --> 01:14:42.944
I repeat, the eagle
is in the nest.

01:14:42.977 --> 01:14:46.181
- What?
- <i>I mean, the Polybius is in my hand.</i>

01:14:46.213 --> 01:14:48.015
I've, I've got the Polybius.

01:14:48.782 --> 01:14:50.651
Well, I don't want
to spoil your fun,

01:14:50.685 --> 01:14:52.286
but we've got five minutes
until the system resets,

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:55.090
<i>and the CCTV catches us.
So, get out of there!</i>

01:15:05.732 --> 01:15:07.134
Hello, Dr. Ashen.

01:15:08.035 --> 01:15:10.838
You must obey me.

01:15:10.871 --> 01:15:13.040
I am your boss.

01:15:13.074 --> 01:15:16.878
I am the boss of bosses.

01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:20.414
Come on, Anton, you got this.
You're the man!

01:15:20.447 --> 01:15:23.185
You are the man! Hey!

01:15:24.384 --> 01:15:26.021
How you doing?

01:15:26.053 --> 01:15:28.723
How, uh, long have you
been standing there?

01:15:30.857 --> 01:15:32.293
Never mind, good.

01:15:32.325 --> 01:15:33.395
Go with that.

01:15:33.428 --> 01:15:35.063
Yeah, we're just sightseeing.

01:15:35.096 --> 01:15:36.397
And your building's brilliant.

01:15:36.431 --> 01:15:37.932
Great job, we're going now.

01:15:37.964 --> 01:15:39.234
- Bye.
- Wait.

01:15:45.205 --> 01:15:46.374
I get it now.

01:15:48.008 --> 01:15:49.810
You're trying
to steal the Polybius!

01:15:51.745 --> 01:15:56.217
And now I'm here
to ruin all your plans.

01:15:56.951 --> 01:16:00.021
No wonder your dad left
you all those years ago.

01:16:04.859 --> 01:16:06.326
Benny!

01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:09.998
What are you doing?

01:16:10.030 --> 01:16:12.833
Thank you very much.

01:16:12.866 --> 01:16:15.136
You lose again, Dr. Ashen.

01:16:19.874 --> 01:16:23.712
Wait, did your best friend just

01:16:23.745 --> 01:16:24.946
betray you?

01:16:27.414 --> 01:16:30.384
Oh, my God, that is too much.

01:16:30.418 --> 01:16:34.121
Your whole life people have been
letting you down, haven't they?

01:16:34.155 --> 01:16:35.724
You loser!

01:16:43.364 --> 01:16:45.232
You're not going
to get away with this.

01:16:45.266 --> 01:16:47.435
You, you loser.

01:16:51.371 --> 01:16:52.941
No!

01:17:02.016 --> 01:17:04.085
There's something
for your fifth autobiography.

01:17:05.253 --> 01:17:06.855
You dick.

01:17:11.558 --> 01:17:14.161
All right, uh,
Team Soaring Eagle of Destiny,

01:17:14.195 --> 01:17:17.465
and Team Boiled Celery,
everything's going well.

01:17:17.498 --> 01:17:21.369
We do have a few alarms, so everyone
needs to get out of there right now!

01:17:21.401 --> 01:17:24.239
<i>Intruder alert.</i>

01:17:24.271 --> 01:17:25.506
<i>Intruder alert.</i>

01:17:28.543 --> 01:17:30.045
<i>Authorities notified.</i>

01:17:34.481 --> 01:17:35.549
Two minutes!

01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:39.419
<i>Upper quadrant lockdown.</i>

01:17:39.453 --> 01:17:41.289
<i>Please scan again to deescalate.</i>

01:17:45.159 --> 01:17:47.094
<i>Database reconfiguring.</i>

01:17:47.128 --> 01:17:48.396
<i>Please do not move.</i>

01:17:49.396 --> 01:17:54.902
<i>Scanning, scanning,
scanning, scanning,</i>

01:17:54.936 --> 01:17:57.371
<i>scanning, scan complete.</i>

01:17:57.405 --> 01:17:59.941
<i>Hello, Simon Pegg,
media ambassador.</i>

01:18:02.977 --> 01:18:04.412
One minute left.

01:18:15.155 --> 01:18:16.890
Where are they?
Did they make it out?

01:18:16.923 --> 01:18:19.894
Cyber Ops is down.
Cyber Ops is down!

01:18:20.995 --> 01:18:22.430
Oh, fine,
eye in the sky is down.

01:18:22.463 --> 01:18:24.599
My overrides have been
completely shutout.

01:18:24.632 --> 01:18:27.201
I can't access anything.
This isn't part of my plan.

01:18:27.235 --> 01:18:28.870
Well, it is now, mate.

01:18:28.902 --> 01:18:30.538
Come on, Cube, do something.

01:18:32.138 --> 01:18:34.476
All right, what would Ashens do?

01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:37.312
I've got an idea.

01:18:39.946 --> 01:18:41.415
<i>Wait, Ashens, stop.</i>

01:18:41.449 --> 01:18:43.317
<i>We've got police heading
to the front door.</i>

01:18:43.351 --> 01:18:48.289
Head down the stairs, then
directly to sub-exit 99-P.

01:18:48.321 --> 01:18:50.891
<i>I'm going to get Vocal
to clear the security guards.</i>

01:18:50.924 --> 01:18:53.261
Unit Alpha, the intruders
have been spotted

01:18:53.294 --> 01:18:54.996
<i>in the east wing.</i>

01:18:56.364 --> 01:18:57.632
30 seconds.

01:18:57.664 --> 01:19:00.467
Unit Omega,
move to the west wing.

01:19:02.003 --> 01:19:04.906
Unit Zeta, move down
to the basement.

01:19:06.606 --> 01:19:12.145
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...

01:19:12.178 --> 01:19:18.051
...five, four, three, two, one.

01:19:20.155 --> 01:19:24.225
- And they are out of there.
- Yes!

01:19:24.258 --> 01:19:26.561
The babies are thrown out
with the bath water.

01:19:26.593 --> 01:19:28.230
Nice one, Cube.

01:19:31.132 --> 01:19:32.200
Let's go!

01:19:36.570 --> 01:19:38.005
Come on then, let's see it.

01:19:39.272 --> 01:19:40.607
I don't have it.

01:19:40.641 --> 01:19:42.277
What do you mean
you don't have it?

01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:44.678
I mean, Benny stole the chip.

01:19:44.712 --> 01:19:48.449
He played me like a fiddle
or a cello or a double bass

01:19:48.481 --> 01:19:50.284
or some sort of bloody
stringed instrument.

01:19:54.454 --> 01:19:56.523
He betrayed us.

01:19:56.557 --> 01:19:58.193
- What are you saying, I...
- Enough!

01:20:04.664 --> 01:20:07.067
Stop the van,
just stop the bloody van!

01:20:10.570 --> 01:20:12.306
Ashens, where are you going?

01:20:12.339 --> 01:20:13.540
Stuart, come back!

01:20:13.574 --> 01:20:15.076
He is no longer in the vehicle.

01:20:53.347 --> 01:20:55.282
I keep telling you we're not

01:20:55.316 --> 01:20:57.319
that kind of collections agency!

01:21:04.290 --> 01:21:05.625
Hi, Stuart.

01:21:05.659 --> 01:21:08.096
Oh, hi, Chris.
What are you doing here?

01:21:08.129 --> 01:21:12.367
Drop it, Stuart. I saw you on
CCTV and I figured out the rest,

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:14.669
including Jarred.

01:21:14.701 --> 01:21:16.503
Look, I'm sorry,
I couldn't tell you...

01:21:16.536 --> 01:21:18.772
I don't want to
talk about it now.

01:21:18.806 --> 01:21:21.543
I take it Benny running off
wasn't part of the plan?

01:21:24.578 --> 01:21:25.612
I'm sorry.

01:21:27.347 --> 01:21:28.282
Stuart...

01:21:30.351 --> 01:21:32.053
why do you want the Polybius?

01:21:34.054 --> 01:21:35.690
Well, you know,
it's very dangerous,

01:21:35.722 --> 01:21:38.025
- isn't it, and...
- Stuart, come on.

01:21:41.795 --> 01:21:44.664
I thought
if I could get hold of it,

01:21:44.697 --> 01:21:46.735
then maybe it would
give us some peace.

01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:54.275
Uh, maybe I could work out why it was so
important that he had, he had to desert us.

01:22:09.623 --> 01:22:13.261
- How?
- I'm not as naive as you think I am.

01:22:13.294 --> 01:22:15.096
It's called GPS.

01:22:15.129 --> 01:22:17.766
As soon as you started sniffing
around I put a bug on it.

01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:22.570
Now, what are you going to do?

01:22:22.602 --> 01:22:25.105
First, I've got
some people to apologize to.

01:22:35.583 --> 01:22:37.485
I love this crew.

01:22:37.517 --> 01:22:40.587
Honestly, you're the nicest
people I've ever met.

01:22:42.155 --> 01:22:43.690
Everybody leaves me.

01:22:43.723 --> 01:22:47.328
Just as I was
starting to like him.

01:22:55.268 --> 01:22:58.606
So, I'm sorry I stormed off.

01:22:59.606 --> 01:23:01.241
I needed some time to think

01:23:01.275 --> 01:23:03.744
and there's something
I want to say.

01:23:03.776 --> 01:23:06.513
I know I haven't been
the easiest bugger to work with,

01:23:06.547 --> 01:23:08.648
but what we just pulled off,

01:23:08.682 --> 01:23:11.853
the most amazing heist ever,

01:23:11.886 --> 01:23:14.821
is something
we can all be proud of.

01:23:14.855 --> 01:23:18.659
Now, I know where Benny
and the Polybius are.

01:23:18.691 --> 01:23:20.527
I'm going to go and get it,

01:23:20.561 --> 01:23:24.199
and I would love it if you
would finish this job with me.

01:23:25.266 --> 01:23:27.435
Betrayal made you quit.

01:23:28.669 --> 01:23:31.172
Hope brought you back.

01:23:32.539 --> 01:23:34.341
It has been
an honor and pleasure

01:23:34.374 --> 01:23:37.244
to work with you.
Of course we will.

01:23:37.277 --> 01:23:39.713
Okay, here's the plan.

01:23:58.264 --> 01:23:59.167
Benny.

01:24:00.467 --> 01:24:03.603
Ashens. You surprise me again.

01:24:03.637 --> 01:24:05.373
Why'd you do it, Benny?

01:24:05.405 --> 01:24:06.873
Oh, I don't know, Ashens.

01:24:06.906 --> 01:24:08.909
I got tired of your arrogance.

01:24:08.942 --> 01:24:11.646
Of you always wanting
to control everything.

01:24:11.678 --> 01:24:14.181
All I wanted
was my name on the door.

01:24:14.214 --> 01:24:16.383
And even that was
too much for you.

01:24:16.417 --> 01:24:18.218
If I'd have known it meant
that much to you, Benny,

01:24:18.252 --> 01:24:21.188
- I'd had your name tattooed across my chest.
- What?

01:24:22.522 --> 01:24:24.292
Tattooed?

01:24:24.325 --> 01:24:25.693
I said, I wanted it on the door.

01:24:25.726 --> 01:24:27.728
Yeah, no,
I was emphasizing a point.

01:24:27.761 --> 01:24:28.730
Ah.

01:24:29.663 --> 01:24:30.731
Yeah, I get it.

01:24:30.763 --> 01:24:32.833
Anyway, a few months ago

01:24:32.865 --> 01:24:34.334
I was approached by someone

01:24:34.368 --> 01:24:36.504
who did see
the value in my work.

01:24:36.536 --> 01:24:39.272
At last, my name
would be famous!

01:24:39.306 --> 01:24:40.473
Who?

01:24:40.507 --> 01:24:43.411
Oh, I think you might know him.

01:24:48.348 --> 01:24:49.484
Hello, boy.

01:24:50.383 --> 01:24:51.284
Daddy?

01:24:51.317 --> 01:24:53.253
Stuarticus.

01:24:55.422 --> 01:24:57.357
It's just Stuart now,
just Stuart.

01:24:57.391 --> 01:25:00.561
Or should I call you Ashens?

01:25:00.593 --> 01:25:02.596
No, let's not.

01:25:03.597 --> 01:25:04.766
Stand up straight, boy.

01:25:06.499 --> 01:25:09.736
I must congratulate you
on retrieving the Polybius.

01:25:09.770 --> 01:25:13.406
I could never recapture what
went into my original work.

01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:15.576
And with my limited resources,

01:25:15.609 --> 01:25:18.512
I was unable to get the chip
without your help.

01:25:18.544 --> 01:25:22.350
Your little friend Benny
was very helpful

01:25:22.383 --> 01:25:23.851
in facilitating that.

01:25:23.883 --> 01:25:26.253
Why didn't you ever
try and contact us?

01:25:26.286 --> 01:25:27.754
Because I couldn't
compromise my security.

01:25:27.788 --> 01:25:30.857
The military
are still looking for me,

01:25:30.891 --> 01:25:34.661
but now that I have
a fully operational Polybius...

01:25:35.795 --> 01:25:38.266
I can finish what I started!

01:25:38.298 --> 01:25:40.701
Nothing was more important
than the Polybius.

01:25:41.602 --> 01:25:43.304
Not even your own family.

01:25:43.337 --> 01:25:47.976
Stuart, this is the
culmination of my life.

01:25:49.243 --> 01:25:52.545
How could I look you and
Christine in the eye as a failure?

01:25:52.579 --> 01:25:55.282
What we needed was our father!

01:25:57.918 --> 01:25:58.953
Perhaps.

01:26:02.889 --> 01:26:06.427
I have a proposal for you.

01:26:06.459 --> 01:26:08.828
I would like you to join me.

01:26:08.861 --> 01:26:09.763
In what?

01:26:09.797 --> 01:26:12.465
After my final test,

01:26:12.499 --> 01:26:15.002
I... we are to embark

01:26:15.035 --> 01:26:16.871
on a wondrous journey!

01:26:16.904 --> 01:26:18.705
Why are you still testing?

01:26:18.739 --> 01:26:21.942
- I don't understand.
- What do you mean?

01:26:21.975 --> 01:26:25.012
Can't you see
how important this is?

01:26:32.018 --> 01:26:33.887
No.

01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:35.588
No, I can't.

01:26:35.621 --> 01:26:38.026
After all these years
it's pointless.

01:26:38.793 --> 01:26:41.896
Look, I know that
this is important to you,

01:26:41.928 --> 01:26:46.301
but it is not important to me.

01:26:47.133 --> 01:26:49.602
Just as a suspected.

01:26:49.636 --> 01:26:52.507
There was always a little
too much of your mother in you.

01:26:54.007 --> 01:26:55.409
Take him up.

01:27:01.714 --> 01:27:05.585
No!

01:27:17.865 --> 01:27:19.032
Wake him up.

01:27:21.634 --> 01:27:25.705
Look, son, look at
what I've created for us.

01:27:25.739 --> 01:27:28.808
With this I shall be
able to test the Polybius

01:27:28.842 --> 01:27:31.846
on every person playing a game

01:27:31.879 --> 01:27:34.582
for thousands of miles.

01:27:35.316 --> 01:27:37.051
Chris, what are you doing here?

01:27:37.084 --> 01:27:38.453
I followed you here from...

01:27:39.919 --> 01:27:41.121
Daddy?

01:27:41.155 --> 01:27:43.624
- Daddy, is that you?
- Oh, good.

01:27:43.656 --> 01:27:46.627
So you were able to join
us after all, Christine.

01:27:46.660 --> 01:27:50.431
So nice to have us
all together again.

01:27:50.463 --> 01:27:51.531
What's going on?

01:27:51.565 --> 01:27:53.067
You are both about to witness

01:27:53.100 --> 01:27:56.704
something truly amazing.

01:27:57.437 --> 01:28:03.410
After all these years,
at last my final test.

01:28:03.444 --> 01:28:05.178
No, you can't!
It's too dangerous!

01:28:05.212 --> 01:28:09.182
I have awaited this moment
my whole life.

01:28:09.215 --> 01:28:12.486
The time is now.

01:28:25.566 --> 01:28:27.068
- Benny!
- Sorry.

01:28:28.768 --> 01:28:29.837
Sorry.

01:28:35.075 --> 01:28:37.711
Get the extension lead, man.

01:28:37.744 --> 01:28:39.714
Sorry, it's all the drama.

01:28:48.688 --> 01:28:53.794
At last, the hour
of greatness is upon us.

01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:59.900
Yes, yes!

01:29:27.794 --> 01:29:30.865
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:29:30.897 --> 01:29:32.266
What's happening?

01:29:32.298 --> 01:29:34.133
How did they take it offline?

01:29:52.753 --> 01:29:54.688
Okay, we have to shut it off.
I'll just unplug it.

01:29:54.721 --> 01:29:56.956
No, if we cut the power
the capacitor will pulse

01:29:56.990 --> 01:29:58.692
<i>and that could kill
anyone affected.</i>

01:29:58.725 --> 01:30:00.127
<i>We need to short it out somehow.</i>

01:30:02.663 --> 01:30:04.565
Chris, do you still
have the Ashen coin?

01:30:17.044 --> 01:30:19.313
No, no!

01:30:19.346 --> 01:30:20.781
What have you done?

01:30:20.813 --> 01:30:23.784
Father, Father, we have to go.

01:30:23.816 --> 01:30:25.285
No, I can't come now.

01:30:27.987 --> 01:30:29.923
Come on, let's get out of here.

01:30:39.333 --> 01:30:40.701
Go, go, go, go, go.

01:30:43.669 --> 01:30:44.605
Go.

01:30:47.139 --> 01:30:48.008
No!

01:30:54.947 --> 01:30:55.850
No!

01:30:56.917 --> 01:30:59.152
I'll lose it!

01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:06.593
Woo!

01:31:08.962 --> 01:31:10.697
Woo.

01:31:16.003 --> 01:31:18.339
What happened to father?
Did he make it out?

01:31:18.371 --> 01:31:20.674
I don't know, Chris.
I... I don't know.

01:31:22.843 --> 01:31:25.112
Why? Why did he do it?

01:31:25.978 --> 01:31:29.717
We'll never know, but it
doesn't matter anymore.

01:31:29.749 --> 01:31:30.784
You know that.

01:31:31.884 --> 01:31:32.986
I suppose it doesn't.

01:31:33.887 --> 01:31:35.889
Come on, we should go.

01:31:35.922 --> 01:31:38.225
No, thanks. I think I'm going
to go home and figure out

01:31:38.258 --> 01:31:39.994
what to do with my life.

01:31:40.026 --> 01:31:42.329
You know what you're
doing, Chris. You'll be fine.

01:31:43.730 --> 01:31:45.098
Thank you, Stuart.

01:31:55.709 --> 01:31:58.145
Come on, guys.
In the van and back to the warehouse.

01:32:04.383 --> 01:32:07.020
Well done, guys.

01:32:07.053 --> 01:32:09.690
Come through, you
beautiful people. You did it.

01:32:09.722 --> 01:32:11.190
Come on through, come on
through, come on through.

01:32:11.223 --> 01:32:12.926
I'm so proud of you guys.

01:32:12.959 --> 01:32:14.928
Stuart, I knew you could do it.

01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:16.896
Chef didn't believe
in you one second.

01:32:16.929 --> 01:32:18.432
He said, it was a waste
of time and resources.

01:32:18.464 --> 01:32:20.133
There's a weird tension
between you guys,

01:32:20.167 --> 01:32:22.136
but I, I always believed in you.

01:32:22.169 --> 01:32:23.804
I'm sure you did, Geoff.

01:32:23.837 --> 01:32:26.139
Right, I think this calls
for a drink to celebrate.

01:32:26.173 --> 01:32:28.108
I second that.

01:32:28.141 --> 01:32:30.076
Way ahead of you, man. Chef?

01:32:30.110 --> 01:32:32.112
Oh, fancy.

01:32:32.145 --> 01:32:34.080
- You're going to love it.
- It's cheap rubbish.

01:32:34.114 --> 01:32:36.417
Is it Cava?
I think it's Cava. Is it Cava?

01:32:36.450 --> 01:32:38.752
- Something's dead in mine.
- Well, I would like

01:32:38.785 --> 01:32:40.921
- to propose a toast.
- Here, here.

01:32:40.954 --> 01:32:42.790
- Hey!
- I like toast.

01:32:42.822 --> 01:32:44.057
Um, may I?

01:32:44.090 --> 01:32:45.292
Sure, go ahead.

01:32:45.325 --> 01:32:46.360
Good luck, mate.

01:32:47.494 --> 01:32:50.931
Um, uh, we have...

01:32:51.964 --> 01:32:54.869
uh, no, um...

01:32:56.469 --> 01:32:59.839
We've done what
no one else could.

01:32:59.873 --> 01:33:01.709
Certainly what no one
else thought we could.

01:33:02.409 --> 01:33:06.179
Our success
is testament to our skill,

01:33:06.213 --> 01:33:08.982
commitment, and teamwork.

01:33:09.014 --> 01:33:12.386
And I just wanted to say what an absolute
pleasure it's been to meet you all,

01:33:12.419 --> 01:33:15.055
and a real privilege
to work with you.

01:33:15.088 --> 01:33:16.490
Cheers.

01:33:16.522 --> 01:33:18.792
Cheers.

01:33:18.825 --> 01:33:21.095
Whoa, Yiannis, your English
has really improved.

01:33:21.128 --> 01:33:23.496
Oh, thank you very much. Yes,
the cassettes really were very effective.

01:33:23.530 --> 01:33:26.066
Well, enjoy
each other's company, everyone,

01:33:26.098 --> 01:33:29.869
because this is the last time
we can all be together.

01:33:29.902 --> 01:33:31.771
Uh, what about
the Pub Quiz next week?

01:33:31.804 --> 01:33:33.440
- Oh, yeah.
- I forgot about that.

01:33:33.472 --> 01:33:36.042
Yeah, I heard the prize this
week is a tray full of meat.

01:33:36.075 --> 01:33:38.377
- Oh! We can't miss that.
- Well, no, of course.

01:33:38.410 --> 01:33:41.380
Guys, guys, guys, so,
Pub Quiz next Wednesday,

01:33:41.414 --> 01:33:45.786
and that is the last time
we can all be together.

01:33:45.819 --> 01:33:48.388
No, I've got a group voucher
for the bird sanctuary.

01:33:48.420 --> 01:33:50.490
- They've got eagles now.
- Soaring eagles!

01:33:50.523 --> 01:33:53.392
Oh, it's totally my destiny
to see those eagles.

01:33:53.426 --> 01:33:55.462
I did it, yay.

01:33:55.495 --> 01:33:57.498
- I did a callback.
- Ah, snap.

01:33:57.530 --> 01:34:00.032
Right, best plan is
reckon is check the group calendar

01:34:00.066 --> 01:34:01.902
and the last thing booked in,

01:34:01.935 --> 01:34:06.839
that will be the last time
we can all be together.

01:34:06.873 --> 01:34:09.877
- Unless somebody gets one of those bus tickets.
- Hey, guys, come look at this.

01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:12.279
<i>The possible illegal
practices of Antony Agonist,</i>

01:34:12.312 --> 01:34:14.548
<i>the trading of shares of his
company has been suspended</i>

01:34:14.580 --> 01:34:17.316
<i>while he's been put on leave
by the board of directors.</i>

01:34:17.350 --> 01:34:19.352
<i>Agonist now faces financial ruin...</i>

01:34:20.053 --> 01:34:22.122
- It's so good.
- Can you believe it?

01:34:22.155 --> 01:34:24.191
What a loser,
I'm going to buy his company

01:34:24.223 --> 01:34:26.326
- just because I can.
- Pay your taxes.

01:34:27.994 --> 01:34:29.463
I take it that was your doing?

01:34:29.495 --> 01:34:31.297
Well, your unfound accusations

01:34:31.330 --> 01:34:33.065
about me leaking
gave me the idea.

01:34:33.098 --> 01:34:36.536
I just got all his personal
files and released them.

01:34:36.570 --> 01:34:39.173
Thinking of calling
myself CubeLeaks.

01:34:39.205 --> 01:34:41.874
- Like files, not physically.
- Got it.

01:34:41.907 --> 01:34:43.944
Yeah, you understand,
you get it, yeah?

01:34:43.977 --> 01:34:45.445
I understand exactly
what you mean,

01:34:45.477 --> 01:34:48.014
and I just wanted
to say thank you.

01:34:48.048 --> 01:34:49.349
We couldn't have
done without you.

01:34:49.382 --> 01:34:51.951
No, you couldn't and
you're welcome.

01:34:53.486 --> 01:34:54.822
Hello, everyone.

01:34:55.655 --> 01:34:57.256
Hello, fella, good to see you.

01:34:57.289 --> 01:34:59.225
- What happened to the other guy?
- Oh, he died.

01:34:59.258 --> 01:35:00.326
It's very sad.

01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:02.129
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

01:35:02.161 --> 01:35:03.864
How much money did you get?

01:35:03.896 --> 01:35:07.500
Uh, 195,888 pound.

01:35:07.534 --> 01:35:08.936
What?

01:35:08.968 --> 01:35:10.971
Money!

01:35:11.004 --> 01:35:12.406
I love money!

01:35:13.807 --> 01:35:16.977
- Turns out people really love heists.
- Well, that was unexpected.

01:35:17.009 --> 01:35:19.279
- What are we going to do with the money?
- We could go on a holiday.

01:35:19.312 --> 01:35:21.982
One of those sun-filled
happy family holidays.

01:35:22.014 --> 01:35:25.285
Yes, those are never
stressful or cause tension.

01:35:25.317 --> 01:35:28.088
Yeah, I could with a holiday.
Where should we go?

01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:32.558
Oh, what about Grimsby, oh
Grimsville, uh, Grimesville?

01:35:32.592 --> 01:35:35.395
I've always wanted to go somewhere
where it like sounds like that.

01:35:35.428 --> 01:35:37.331
Fun fact about the word grim,

01:35:37.364 --> 01:35:40.133
it derives from the old
Dutch word meaning fisherman.

01:35:40.165 --> 01:35:42.034
And be means village.

01:35:42.067 --> 01:35:45.504
Fisherman's village. Facts!

01:35:45.538 --> 01:35:47.641
Um,
what's my Visa status by the way?

01:35:47.673 --> 01:35:51.845
Am I settled or not? I'm still
rather confused about your country.

01:36:18.137 --> 01:36:20.039
Do you have the
following comic books:

01:36:20.072 --> 01:36:23.910
"Kill Avenger Number 47,"
"Hunter Force Number 25,"

01:36:23.944 --> 01:36:27.214
also do you have
"New Detective Comics 109,"

01:36:27.246 --> 01:36:29.650
the special edition
in the Old English language?

01:36:29.682 --> 01:36:32.319
Also, why have you not moved the
comic to the front like I asked?

01:36:32.352 --> 01:36:34.955
I said last week it would look so much
better if you just them in the front here.

01:36:34.987 --> 01:36:38.057
I don't know why you never listen to me.
I literally know what's best for the store.

01:36:38.090 --> 01:36:40.560
I've been going here for years.
I just want satisfaction, okay?

01:36:40.593 --> 01:36:42.329
As a customer and someone
who would work here.

01:36:42.361 --> 01:36:45.364
I just want satisfaction.
Satisfaction, satisfaction!

01:36:52.237 --> 01:36:53.507
<i>I like your 'touche.</i>

01:36:53.539 --> 01:36:55.374
Thank you, I grew it myself.

01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:02.049
Don't tell anyone I was here.

01:37:02.782 --> 01:37:06.954
Get your signed
autobiographies here

01:37:06.986 --> 01:37:11.057
about the famed
but now totally bankrupt

01:37:11.090 --> 01:37:13.660
entrepreneur, Antony Agonist.

01:37:13.692 --> 01:37:16.730
Not ghost written
like many autobiographies.

01:37:16.762 --> 01:37:18.230
Got any vinyl?

01:37:18.263 --> 01:37:20.133
Do I have any vinyl?

01:37:21.234 --> 01:37:24.004
Do I have any vinyl?

01:37:24.036 --> 01:37:26.505
Does it look like
I have any vinyl?

01:37:26.539 --> 01:37:28.475
- You losers!
- Go!

01:37:33.178 --> 01:37:35.281
Oh, I wish people would
stop doing that to me.

01:37:36.182 --> 01:37:38.085
I'm a genius!

01:37:38.118 --> 01:37:40.420
I'm a freaking stable genius!

01:37:42.521 --> 01:37:44.156
I hate it here.

01:37:44.190 --> 01:37:46.593
Everything's so used and old.

01:38:50.490 --> 01:38:52.760
- Hello?
- Hello, Jarred?

01:38:53.726 --> 01:38:55.295
Oh, Christine.

01:38:55.328 --> 01:38:58.264
Look, I am so sorry
about what happened.

01:38:58.298 --> 01:39:02.069
You've been
a very naughty boy, Jarred.

01:39:03.870 --> 01:39:08.141
Oh, oh, I have been naughty.

01:39:08.173 --> 01:39:09.842
<i>Really naughty.</i>

01:39:09.875 --> 01:39:11.177
Will you forgive me?

01:39:12.178 --> 01:39:13.713
Convince me.

01:39:13.745 --> 01:39:18.484
Well, picture us
mowing a lawn together,

01:39:18.517 --> 01:39:22.455
with an old school
rotary mower. Sweating.

01:39:22.489 --> 01:39:24.124
<i>Oh, Jarred.</i>

01:39:29.695 --> 01:39:30.563
<i>Goodbye.</i>

01:39:30.594 --> 01:39:31.390
