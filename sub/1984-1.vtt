WEBVTT

01:09.988 --> 01:12.243
I still don't know why I'm here.

01:12.968 --> 01:14.914
Couldn't you just make them say yes?

01:14.977 --> 01:17.044
Yes, I could, but it's not my way.

01:17.454 --> 01:19.332
And I would expect you, of all people,

01:19.334 --> 01:22.168
would understand my feelings
about the misuse of power.

01:22.736 --> 01:25.978
Power corrupts and all that.
Yes, I know, Charles.

01:26.505 --> 01:28.177
When are you going
to stop lecturing me?

01:28.191 --> 01:29.473
When you start listening.

01:30.175 --> 01:32.087
You're here because I need you.

01:32.677 --> 01:35.461
We're not gonna have to meet every
one of them in person, don't we?

01:35.542 --> 01:36.145
No.

01:37.576 --> 01:38.843
This one's special.

01:40.685 --> 01:42.225
What a beautiful campus.

01:42.227 --> 01:43.355
John, don't you think?

01:43.522 --> 01:45.244
Yeah, the brochure is great.

01:46.191 --> 01:47.344
But what about Jean?

01:47.931 --> 01:49.087
What about her...

01:49.416 --> 01:50.356
illness?

01:50.444 --> 01:52.530
Illness?
John.

01:52.697 --> 01:55.014
You think your daughter is sick, Mr Grey?

01:55.016 --> 01:57.453
Perhaps it would be best
if we were to speak to her.

01:57.839 --> 01:58.768
Alone.

01:59.052 --> 01:59.862
Of course.

02:01.414 --> 02:02.206
Jean,

02:02.387 --> 02:03.632
can you come down, dear?

02:14.970 --> 02:17.054
We'll leave you, then.

02:25.272 --> 02:27.053
It's very rude you know,

02:27.315 --> 02:30.398
to read my thoughts or Mr Lensherr's,
without our permission.

02:31.617 --> 02:34.780
Did you think you were the only
one of your kind, young lady?

02:35.244 --> 02:36.399
We're mutants, Jean.

02:36.861 --> 02:38.156
We're like you.

02:39.411 --> 02:40.284
Really?

02:41.129 --> 02:42.236
I doubt that.

02:59.681 --> 03:00.878
Charles.

03:01.766 --> 03:03.457
I like this one.

03:04.436 --> 03:06.896
You have more power than
you can imagine, Jean.

03:07.445 --> 03:10.270
The question is,
will you control that power?

03:13.794 --> 03:15.549
Or let it control you?

03:36.176 --> 03:37.006
Warren?

03:37.810 --> 03:39.430
Son, is everything alright?

03:41.556 --> 03:42.737
What's going on there?

03:42.739 --> 03:44.142
Nothing. I'll be right out.

03:44.650 --> 03:46.471
Come on. You've been in
there for over an hour.

03:48.688 --> 03:49.662
Open the door.

03:50.629 --> 03:51.347
Warren.

03:51.589 --> 03:52.271
One second!

03:55.362 --> 03:56.677
Open this door.

03:57.696 --> 03:58.399
Warren.

04:00.492 --> 04:01.976
Let me in there right now.

04:02.165 --> 04:03.178
Open the door.

04:19.010 --> 04:20.288
Oh God.

04:21.637 --> 04:22.392
Not you.

04:22.905 --> 04:24.892
Dad, I'm sorry.

05:52.187 --> 05:54.265
The whole world's going to hell
and you're just going to sit there?

05:55.030 --> 05:55.758
Let's go.

06:07.619 --> 06:08.498
Bobby!

06:15.752 --> 06:16.685
Thanks, Kitty.

06:24.171 --> 06:25.400
We're getting killed out here.

06:25.500 --> 06:27.373
Yeah, I know.
They're not ready, Storm.

06:29.474 --> 06:31.757
Logan.
Don't get your panties in a bunch.

06:37.315 --> 06:38.729
That was my last cigar.

06:39.317 --> 06:40.984
Logan.

06:42.638 --> 06:43.720
It's getting closer.

06:44.325 --> 06:46.122
Come on. Let's keep moving.

06:46.776 --> 06:48.364
Hey, Tin Man.
Come here.

06:49.369 --> 06:50.579
How's your throwing arm?

06:51.125 --> 06:52.780
Logan, we work as a team.

06:53.206 --> 06:54.317
Yeah. Good luck with that.

06:54.566 --> 06:56.274
Throw me. Now!

06:56.376 --> 06:58.314
Dammit, Logan, don't do this.

07:16.521 --> 07:17.902
Class dismissed.

07:22.026 --> 07:23.398
Hey, Colossus.

07:23.790 --> 07:24.919
Nice throw.

07:27.365 --> 07:29.315
<i>Simulation complete.</i>

07:34.205 --> 07:35.484
What the hell was that?

07:35.548 --> 07:36.536
Danger room session.

07:36.596 --> 07:38.336
You know what I mean.
Lighten up.

07:38.338 --> 07:40.574
Look, you can't just change
the rules when you fell like it.

07:40.576 --> 07:41.757
I'm trying to teach them something.

07:41.759 --> 07:42.961
I taught them something.

07:43.016 --> 07:44.863
It was a defensive exercise.

07:44.883 --> 07:46.814
Yeah, best defense is a good offense.

07:47.012 --> 07:48.484
Or is it the other way round?

07:48.845 --> 07:50.081
This isn't a game, Logan.

07:50.083 --> 07:51.819
Well, you sure fooled me.

07:52.974 --> 07:54.237
Hey, I'm just a sub.

07:54.239 --> 07:55.692
You got a problem, talk to Scott.

08:14.551 --> 08:15.267
<i>Scott!</i>

08:15.589 --> 08:16.441
Jean.

08:16.623 --> 08:17.251
<i>Scott.</i>

08:17.979 --> 08:18.917
<i>Scott.</i>

08:19.507 --> 08:20.540
<i>Scott.</i>

08:21.600 --> 08:22.623
<i>Scott!</i>

08:24.422 --> 08:26.082
Are you ok?
I'm fine.

08:28.426 --> 08:30.485
You don't seem fine. You
seem like you're avoiding me.

08:30.614 --> 08:31.564
I mean something's wrong.

08:31.566 --> 08:34.059
What's wrong it's I can't touch
my boyfriend without killing him.

08:34.062 --> 08:35.438
Other than that I'm wonderful.

08:35.767 --> 08:36.399
Hey.

08:36.958 --> 08:37.827
I don't think that's fair.

08:38.049 --> 08:39.182
Have I ever put any pressure on you?

08:39.489 --> 08:40.705
You're a guy, Bobby.

08:40.735 --> 08:42.243
Your mind's only on one thing.

08:46.474 --> 08:48.994
Hey Scott. They were looking for
you downstairs. You didn't show.

08:48.996 --> 08:49.955
What do you care?

08:50.057 --> 08:52.123
Well for starters,
I had to cover your ass.

08:52.187 --> 08:53.205
I didn't ask you to.

08:53.274 --> 08:55.333
No, you didn't. The professor did.

08:55.411 --> 08:58.214
I was just passing through.
So pass through, Logan.

08:59.040 --> 09:00.045
Hey, look.

09:02.377 --> 09:03.542
I know how you feel.
Don't.

09:03.544 --> 09:04.997
When Jean died...
I said don't.

09:08.466 --> 09:10.231
Maybe it's time for us to move on.

09:14.639 --> 09:16.776
Not everybody heals
as fast as you, Logan.

09:40.164 --> 09:41.290
Mr Secretary.

09:41.424 --> 09:42.210
Yes.

09:44.168 --> 09:45.610
The meeting's begun, sir.

09:45.612 --> 09:46.385
Thank you.

09:53.428 --> 09:54.509
Mr President.

09:55.471 --> 09:56.646
Have a seat, Hank.

09:58.975 --> 10:01.407
Homeland Security
was tracking Magneto.

10:02.186 --> 10:03.383
We got hits in Lisbon,

10:03.385 --> 10:04.285
Geneva,

10:04.287 --> 10:05.149
Montreal.

10:05.857 --> 10:10.049
NAVSAT lost him crossing the border,
but we did get a consolation prize.

10:11.060 --> 10:13.806
We picked her up breaking
into the FDA of all places.

10:13.865 --> 10:15.384
You know who she's been imitating?

10:15.778 --> 10:17.243
Secretary Trask here.

10:17.410 --> 10:18.195
Yes, sir.

10:18.768 --> 10:19.871
She can do that.

10:20.580 --> 10:21.945
Not any more, she can't.

10:22.308 --> 10:23.260
We got her.

10:23.262 --> 10:24.795
You think your prisons can hold her?

10:24.834 --> 10:26.108
We have some new prisons, Hank.

10:26.216 --> 10:27.373
We'll keep them mobile.

10:27.375 --> 10:28.474
Be a step ahead this time.

10:28.546 --> 10:29.976
Where is Magneto?

10:31.507 --> 10:32.384
Raven?

10:33.754 --> 10:35.497
Raven, I asked you a question.

10:36.381 --> 10:37.989
I don't answer to my slave name.

10:38.593 --> 10:41.156
Raven Darkholme.
That's your real name, isn't it?

10:41.517 --> 10:44.179
Or has he convinced you
you don't have a family anymore?

10:45.063 --> 10:48.027
My family tried to kill me,
you pathetic meat sack.

10:49.984 --> 10:51.303
Ok, then. Mystique,

10:52.148 --> 10:53.162
where is he?

10:56.866 --> 10:58.909
In here with us.

10:59.744 --> 11:01.431
I don't want to play games with you.

11:01.433 --> 11:02.997
I want answers.

11:03.164 --> 11:04.912
You don't want to play games with me?

11:05.792 --> 11:07.527
You are gonna stop this.

11:07.619 --> 11:09.249
Tell me, where is Magneto?

11:11.422 --> 11:12.832
You wanna know where he is?

11:21.766 --> 11:23.370
Homo sapien.

11:29.774 --> 11:32.317
You know, her capture
will only provoke Magneto,

11:32.485 --> 11:35.445
but having her does give us
some diplomatic leverage.

11:35.613 --> 11:38.449
On principle, I can't negotiate
with these people.

11:39.617 --> 11:41.751
I thought that's why
you appointed me, sir.

11:41.918 --> 11:42.812
Yes, it is.

11:44.122 --> 11:45.775
But that's not why you called me here.

11:45.777 --> 11:47.096
No. This is.

11:47.792 --> 11:49.870
It's what she stole from the FDA.

11:56.592 --> 11:57.649
Dear Lord.

12:00.263 --> 12:01.448
Is it viable?

12:01.450 --> 12:02.691
We believe it is.

12:05.768 --> 12:08.947
You realize the level of impact
this'll have on the mutant community?

12:08.949 --> 12:10.181
Yes. I do.

12:10.370 --> 12:12.753
That's precisely why
we need some of your...

12:13.251 --> 12:14.623
diplomacy now.

12:18.410 --> 12:21.287
When an individual
acquires great power,

12:21.635 --> 12:25.203
the use or misuse
of that power is everything.

12:25.371 --> 12:27.075
Will it be for the greater good,

12:27.305 --> 12:29.363
or will it be used for personal,

12:30.260 --> 12:31.759
or for destructive ends?

12:32.170 --> 12:34.838
Now, this is a question
we must all ask ourselves.

12:35.006 --> 12:35.721
Why?

12:36.276 --> 12:37.675
Because we are mutants.

12:38.086 --> 12:40.561
For psychics, this presents
a particular problem.

12:40.563 --> 12:45.277
When is it acceptable to use our power
and when do we cross that invisible line

12:45.474 --> 12:48.101
that turns us into tyrants
over our fellow man?

12:48.144 --> 12:49.804
But Einstein said,

12:49.806 --> 12:52.263
that ethics are an exclusive
human concern

12:52.265 --> 12:54.599
without any superhuman authority behind it.

12:54.746 --> 12:56.103
Einstein wasn't a mutant,

12:57.093 --> 12:58.400
so far as we know.

13:00.318 --> 13:02.615
This case study was
sent to me by a colleague,

13:02.617 --> 13:04.572
Dr Moira McTaggert.
Jones.

13:05.823 --> 13:08.930
<i>The man you see here was born
with no higher-level brain functions.</i>

13:09.582 --> 13:11.486
<i>His organs and nervous system work,</i>

13:11.652 --> 13:13.763
<i>but he has no consciousness to speak of.</i>

13:14.143 --> 13:16.104
What if we were to transfer,

13:16.106 --> 13:18.050
the consciousness of one person,

13:18.216 --> 13:21.378
say, a father of four with terminal cancer,

13:21.469 --> 13:23.638
into the body of this man?

13:24.055 --> 13:28.243
How are we to decide what falls within
the range of ethical behavior and what...

13:42.406 --> 13:43.327
Professor?

13:46.369 --> 13:47.827
We'll continue this tomorrow.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.269
Class dismissed.

13:57.755 --> 14:00.518
The forecast was for sunny skies.

14:02.215 --> 14:03.299
I'm sorry.

14:13.044 --> 14:16.107
I don't have to be psychic to see
that something's bothering you.

14:18.609 --> 14:19.640
I don't understand.

14:19.642 --> 14:21.143
Magneto's a fugitive,

14:21.145 --> 14:22.572
we've a mutant in the cabinet,

14:22.574 --> 14:24.129
a president who understands us.

14:24.271 --> 14:25.217
Why are we still hiding?

14:25.219 --> 14:26.214
We're not hiding.

14:26.237 --> 14:28.011
But we still have enemies out there.

14:28.013 --> 14:30.103
And I must protect my students.
You know that.

14:30.105 --> 14:32.650
Yes, but we can't be students forever.

14:33.332 --> 14:35.912
Storm, I haven't thought of you
as my student for years.

14:36.544 --> 14:38.752
In fact, I thought that perhaps,

14:39.085 --> 14:41.174
you might take my place some day.

14:45.428 --> 14:48.023
But Scott's?
Scott's a changed man.

14:48.514 --> 14:50.273
He took Jean's death so hard.

14:51.267 --> 14:52.972
Yes, things are better out there,

14:53.477 --> 14:56.832
but you of all people, know how
fast the weather can change.

14:57.648 --> 14:59.191
There's something you're not telling us.

15:10.119 --> 15:10.979
Hank?

15:12.424 --> 15:14.286
Ororo.
Charles.

15:17.891 --> 15:19.892
I love what you've done with your hair.

15:19.921 --> 15:20.752
You too.

15:22.243 --> 15:23.903
Thank you for seeing
me on such short notice.

15:24.007 --> 15:27.593
Henry, you are always welcome here.
You're a part of this place.

15:27.595 --> 15:28.630
I have news.

15:28.993 --> 15:29.764
Is it Eric?

15:29.931 --> 15:30.692
No.

15:30.694 --> 15:32.755
Though we have been making
some progress on that front.

15:33.184 --> 15:35.014
Mystique was recently apprehended.

15:35.338 --> 15:36.618
Who's the fur ball?

15:37.855 --> 15:38.998
Hank McCoy.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.388
Secretary of Mutant Affairs.

15:40.390 --> 15:41.794
Right, right. The secretary.

15:42.446 --> 15:43.143
Nice suit.

15:43.319 --> 15:44.400
Henry this is Logan.

15:44.508 --> 15:45.720
He's...
Wolverine.

15:46.072 --> 15:47.652
I hear you're quite an animal.

15:47.836 --> 15:49.003
Look who's talking.

15:49.533 --> 15:51.493
You know that Magneto's gonna
come get Mystique, right?

15:51.702 --> 15:53.031
Magneto's not the problem.

15:53.517 --> 15:55.181
At least not our most pressing one.

15:55.623 --> 15:58.970
A major pharmaceutical company
has developed a mutant antibody.

15:59.251 --> 16:02.045
A way to suppress the mutant X gene.

16:02.213 --> 16:03.224
Suppress?

16:03.770 --> 16:04.832
Permanently.

16:05.424 --> 16:06.785
They're calling it a cure.

16:11.263 --> 16:12.461
Well that's ridiculous.

16:12.830 --> 16:14.506
You can't cure being a mutant.

16:14.561 --> 16:17.190
Well scientifically speaking...
Since when did we become a disease?

16:17.331 --> 16:18.674
How can anybody nn there right...
Storm.

16:20.064 --> 16:21.801
They're announcing it now.

16:27.113 --> 16:30.657
These so-called mutants
are people just like us.

16:31.241 --> 16:34.243
Their affliction is nothing
more than a disease,

16:34.370 --> 16:36.886
a corruption of healthy cellular activity.

16:37.580 --> 16:40.368
But I stand here today
to tell you that there is hope.

16:41.103 --> 16:43.872
This site, once the world's
most famous prison,

16:44.171 --> 16:45.874
will now be the source of freedom

16:46.287 --> 16:48.092
for all mutants who choose it.

16:48.712 --> 16:49.816
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

16:51.332 --> 16:54.039
<i>I proudly present the answer to mutation.</i>

16:55.249 --> 16:56.021
<i>Finally...</i>

16:56.904 --> 16:58.170
<i>we have a cure.</i>

17:01.897 --> 17:03.325
Who would want this cure?

17:03.327 --> 17:06.241
I mean, what kind of coward
would take it just to fit in?

17:06.652 --> 17:08.319
Is it cowardice,

17:08.320 --> 17:10.397
to save oneself from persecution?

17:11.156 --> 17:12.976
Not all of us can fit in so easily.

17:13.325 --> 17:14.962
You don't shed on the furniture.

17:15.823 --> 17:18.256
Well, for all we know,
the government help cooked this up.

17:18.329 --> 17:20.343
I can assure you the government
had nothing to do with this.

17:20.345 --> 17:21.667
Well, I've heard that before.

17:22.083 --> 17:25.711
My boy, I have been fighting for mutant
rights since before you had claws.

17:26.797 --> 17:28.073
Did he just call me boy?

17:28.740 --> 17:29.768
Is it true?

17:29.770 --> 17:30.927
They can cure us?

17:32.113 --> 17:33.914
Yes, Rogue. It appears to be true.

17:36.760 --> 17:37.985
No, professor.

17:39.231 --> 17:40.600
They can't cure us.

17:42.938 --> 17:44.201
You wanna know why?

17:44.203 --> 17:45.651
Because there is nothing to cure.

17:45.653 --> 17:47.072
Nothing's wrong with you.

17:47.526 --> 17:49.253
Or any of us, for that matter.

17:51.614 --> 17:53.974
How should we, as mutants, respond?

17:54.446 --> 17:55.728
Here's what I think.

17:56.035 --> 17:58.120
This is about getting organized.

17:58.122 --> 18:01.165
Bringing our complaints
to the right people.

18:01.175 --> 18:04.883
We need to put together a committee
and talk to the government.

18:06.879 --> 18:08.378
They don't understand.

18:08.380 --> 18:11.008
They don't know
what it means to be a mutant.

18:11.527 --> 18:13.192
We need to show them,

18:13.261 --> 18:17.012
educate them, let them
know that we're here to stay.

18:18.724 --> 18:21.011
People, you must listen.

18:21.013 --> 18:23.020
They won't take us seriously,

18:23.022 --> 18:24.692
They wanna exterminate us.

18:24.808 --> 18:26.855
This cure is voluntary.

18:26.857 --> 18:29.456
Nobody is talking about extermination.

18:29.524 --> 18:31.470
No one ever talks about it.

18:33.697 --> 18:35.143
They just do it.

18:36.367 --> 18:38.825
And you'll go on with your lives,

18:38.922 --> 18:41.559
ignoring the signs all around you.

18:42.623 --> 18:46.695
And then one day, when the
air is still and the night has fallen,

18:47.202 --> 18:48.589
they come for you.
Excuse me...

18:48.591 --> 18:52.336
Only then you realize, while you're talking
about organizing and committees,

18:52.424 --> 18:54.599
the extermination has already begun.

18:54.718 --> 18:56.573
Make no mistake, my brothers.

18:56.904 --> 18:58.441
They will draw first blood.

18:59.431 --> 19:02.229
They will force their cure upon us.

19:03.686 --> 19:04.922
The only question is,

19:05.367 --> 19:07.591
will you join my brotherhood and fight?

19:08.274 --> 19:11.076
Or wait for the inevitable genocide?

19:11.944 --> 19:14.453
Who will you stand with? The humans?

19:16.282 --> 19:17.330
Or us?

19:26.825 --> 19:29.195
You talk pretty tough for a guy in a cape.

19:30.588 --> 19:31.496
Back off.

19:33.067 --> 19:35.473
If you're so proud of being a mutant,
where's your mark?

19:38.554 --> 19:41.681
I have been marked once, my dear.
Let me assure you.

19:41.849 --> 19:44.522
No needle shall ever
touch my skin again.

19:44.786 --> 19:46.067
You know who you're talking to?

19:47.813 --> 19:48.768
Do you?

19:51.442 --> 19:53.038
And what can you do?

19:55.752 --> 19:57.507
So you have talents?

19:58.115 --> 19:59.138
That and more.

19:59.763 --> 20:01.184
I know you control metal.

20:01.285 --> 20:04.896
And I know there is 87 mutants in here,
none of them above a class three.

20:05.456 --> 20:06.475
Other than you two.

20:09.193 --> 20:11.913
You can sense other mutants
and their powers?

20:15.049 --> 20:17.425
Could you locate one for me?

20:35.653 --> 20:36.931
Let me out of here.

20:37.971 --> 20:39.837
I demand that you release me.

20:40.616 --> 20:41.986
Do you know who I am?

20:42.247 --> 20:44.470
I'm the president of the United States.

20:45.092 --> 20:46.203
Mr President.

20:46.205 --> 20:47.313
Shut up.

20:49.667 --> 20:51.394
Why are you doing this to me?

20:51.712 --> 20:53.005
Let me down.

20:53.007 --> 20:55.760
I'll be a good girl.
Please let me go.

20:56.340 --> 20:57.114
Please.

20:57.878 --> 21:00.455
Keep it up.
I'll spray you in the face, bitch.

21:03.013 --> 21:04.615
When I get out of here,

21:05.962 --> 21:07.329
I'm going to kill you myself.

21:08.223 --> 21:09.362
Yeah, right.

21:38.424 --> 21:41.384
Secretary McCoy,
welcome to Worthington Labs.

21:41.552 --> 21:43.943
Thank you, Dr Rao.
Not an easy place to get to.

21:43.971 --> 21:46.193
It's the safest location we could find.

21:46.195 --> 21:48.642
That's why we keep
the source of the cure here.

21:49.150 --> 21:50.549
He is a mutant.

21:50.801 --> 21:52.236
You understand our concern.

21:52.396 --> 21:55.296
We are in full compliance
with your department policy.

21:55.454 --> 21:56.923
How long will you keep the boy here?

21:57.067 --> 21:58.806
Until we can fully map his DNA.

21:58.808 --> 22:01.032
We can replicate it,
but we can't generate it.

22:01.071 --> 22:02.142
And his power?

22:02.144 --> 22:03.407
What is its range?

22:03.574 --> 22:04.506
You'll see.

22:09.455 --> 22:10.466
Jimmy.

22:11.415 --> 22:13.310
There's someone
I would like you to meet.

22:15.085 --> 22:16.261
Hello there, son.

22:17.755 --> 22:18.593
Hi.

22:18.595 --> 22:20.090
My name is Hank McCoy.

22:27.685 --> 22:28.908
I'm sorry.

22:30.100 --> 22:31.053
It's ok.

22:41.111 --> 22:42.885
You have an amazing gift.

22:43.792 --> 22:44.969
Thank you, Jimmy.

22:54.958 --> 22:56.563
Extraordinary, isn't he?

22:58.337 --> 22:59.488
Yes, he is.

23:37.314 --> 23:38.381
<i>Scott.</i>

23:49.334 --> 23:50.015
<i>Scott.</i>

23:51.043 --> 23:53.024
<i>Scott. Scott!</i>

23:53.559 --> 23:55.630
<i>Can you hear me? I'm still here.</i>

23:55.632 --> 23:57.646
<i>Scott. Scott.</i>
Stop.

23:57.813 --> 23:59.470
<i>I'm here. Scott!</i>
Stop it.

23:59.472 --> 24:00.322
<i>Scott!</i>
Stop it.

24:00.600 --> 24:01.862
<i>Scott!</i>
Stop it.

24:02.136 --> 24:03.192
<i>Scott!</i>

24:03.193 --> 24:05.528
<i>I need you, Scott! Scott! Scott!</i>

24:05.696 --> 24:08.448
Stop!

25:05.245 --> 25:06.060
Jean?

25:08.258 --> 25:09.204
Scott.

25:12.638 --> 25:13.542
How?

25:18.977 --> 25:20.152
I don't know.

25:35.786 --> 25:37.262
I wanna see your eyes.

25:40.239 --> 25:41.841
Take these off.
No.

25:44.127 --> 25:44.903
No.

25:45.963 --> 25:46.948
Trust me.

25:47.544 --> 25:49.022
I can control it now.

25:56.974 --> 25:57.974
Open them.

25:59.034 --> 26:00.169
You can't hurt me.

26:35.554 --> 26:36.752
What happened?
No clue.

26:38.557 --> 26:39.821
Professor, are you ok?

26:40.448 --> 26:41.799
Get to Alkali Lake.

27:10.589 --> 27:12.170
You don't want to be here.

27:12.820 --> 27:13.677
Do you?

27:37.074 --> 27:38.615
I can't see a damn thing.

27:39.576 --> 27:40.920
I can take care of that.

27:58.220 --> 27:59.267
What the...

28:34.464 --> 28:35.521
Logan!

28:41.584 --> 28:42.137
Oh God.

28:42.139 --> 28:43.169
She's alive.

28:48.478 --> 28:49.311
Jean.

28:53.442 --> 28:58.738
The sheer mass of water that collapsed on top
of Jean should have obliterated her completely.

28:58.905 --> 29:02.461
The only explanation of Jean's survival
is that her powers,

29:02.463 --> 29:05.483
wrapped her in a cocoon
of telekinetic energy.

29:08.331 --> 29:09.630
Is she gonna be ok?

29:10.000 --> 29:13.364
Jean Grey is the only class
five mutant I've ever encountered,

29:13.441 --> 29:15.304
her potential practically limitless.

29:15.756 --> 29:20.468
Her mutation is seated in the unconscious
part of her mind and therein lay the danger.

29:20.946 --> 29:25.014
When she was a girl,
I created a series of psychic barriers

29:25.182 --> 29:27.683
to isolate her powers
from her conscious mind.

29:27.851 --> 29:31.414
And as a result,
Jean developed a dual personality.

29:32.780 --> 29:33.655
What?

29:34.024 --> 29:37.244
The conscious Jean, whose
powers were always in her control,

29:37.544 --> 29:39.617
and the dormant side.

29:40.071 --> 29:42.642
A personality that, in our sessions,

29:43.630 --> 29:46.150
came to call itself the Phoenix.

29:46.661 --> 29:48.446
A purely instinctual creature,

29:48.448 --> 29:50.324
all desire and joy...

29:50.841 --> 29:51.889
and rage.

29:53.919 --> 29:55.115
She knew all this?

29:55.546 --> 29:57.409
It's unclear how much she knew.

29:58.048 --> 30:02.139
Far more critical is whether the woman
in front of us is the Jean Grey we know,

30:03.386 --> 30:06.614
or the Phoenix furiously
struggling to be free.

30:06.778 --> 30:09.809
She looks peaceful to me.
Because I'm keeping her that way.

30:10.385 --> 30:12.390
I'm trying to restore the psychic blocks

30:12.392 --> 30:13.901
and cage the beast again.

30:15.607 --> 30:16.674
What have you done to her?

30:18.068 --> 30:19.325
Logan, you have to understand,

30:19.327 --> 30:21.640
You're talking about
a person's mind here, about Jean.

30:21.738 --> 30:24.093
She has to be controlled.
Controlled?

30:24.825 --> 30:27.868
You know sometimes, when you cage
the beast, the beast gets angry.

30:28.411 --> 30:29.647
You have no idea.

30:30.166 --> 30:32.541
You have no idea
of what she is capable.

30:32.707 --> 30:33.623
No, Professor.

30:33.840 --> 30:35.748
I had no idea what
you were capable of.

30:35.822 --> 30:37.588
I had a terrible choice to make.

30:37.590 --> 30:39.438
I chose the lesser of two evils.

30:39.631 --> 30:42.147
It sounds to me like Jean
had no choice at all.

30:43.593 --> 30:45.347
I don't have to explain myself,

30:46.193 --> 30:47.380
least of all to you.

30:55.939 --> 30:57.841
History will be made here today.

30:57.843 --> 31:00.440
For the first time
the so-called mutant cure,

31:00.442 --> 31:02.112
will be available to the public.

31:02.279 --> 31:05.666
Reaction has run the gamut
with mutants on both sides of the line.

31:05.992 --> 31:07.625
<i>Some are desperate for this cure,</i>

31:07.627 --> 31:10.946
<i>while others are offended
by the very idea of it.</i>

31:25.282 --> 31:27.079
Will Secretary McCoy be a problem?

31:27.345 --> 31:28.276
Hard to say.

31:28.278 --> 31:32.453
His political views seem somewhat
at odds with his personal issues.

31:33.101 --> 31:34.236
Excuse me, sir.

31:34.487 --> 31:35.664
Your son's arrived.

31:36.479 --> 31:37.195
Good.

31:37.831 --> 31:38.487
Bring him in.

31:38.831 --> 31:40.649
Are you sure you want to start with him?

31:40.817 --> 31:42.540
I think it's important. Yes.

31:44.946 --> 31:46.749
Hello, Warren.
How are you, son?

31:47.775 --> 31:49.355
Did you sleep well?
Yeah.

31:49.868 --> 31:51.849
You know, I'm proud
of you for doing this.

31:52.829 --> 31:54.165
Everything's gonna be fine.

31:54.705 --> 31:55.992
I promise.
Yeah.

31:58.725 --> 31:59.596
Ready?

32:29.324 --> 32:32.077
The transformation can be
a little jarring.

32:37.207 --> 32:39.108
Dad, can we talk
about this for a second?

32:39.110 --> 32:40.563
We've talked about it, son.

32:40.973 --> 32:42.415
It'll all be over soon.

32:44.026 --> 32:45.576
Everything's going to be fine.

32:46.118 --> 32:47.081
Wait.

32:48.526 --> 32:50.051
I can't do this.

32:50.053 --> 32:51.442
Warren, calm down.

32:51.444 --> 32:53.396
No. I can't do this.

32:53.398 --> 32:54.236
Yes, you can.

32:54.265 --> 32:55.667
I can't do this.
Just relax, son.

32:55.870 --> 32:57.560
Take it easy. Calm down.
I can't do this!

32:57.562 --> 32:58.432
I promise you.

32:58.434 --> 32:59.369
Dad!
It will be fine.

32:59.507 --> 33:00.825
Warren, relax.

33:09.530 --> 33:11.406
Warren, it's a better life.

33:12.534 --> 33:13.954
It's what we all want.

33:14.367 --> 33:15.258
No.

33:16.246 --> 33:17.477
It's what you want.

33:20.542 --> 33:21.638
Warren, no!

34:36.909 --> 34:38.063
Told you so.

34:54.808 --> 34:55.683
About time.

34:56.580 --> 34:57.827
I've been busy.

34:58.233 --> 34:59.755
Did you find what you were looking for?

34:59.882 --> 35:01.370
The source of the cure is a mutant.

35:01.906 --> 35:03.530
A child at Worthington Labs.

35:03.686 --> 35:05.103
Without him, they have nothing.

35:06.725 --> 35:08.035
Read off the guest list.

35:09.734 --> 35:11.980
Cell 41205.

35:12.378 --> 35:13.863
James Madrox.

35:14.030 --> 35:15.629
This one robbed seven banks.

35:22.038 --> 35:23.562
At the same time.

35:23.751 --> 35:25.603
I could use a man of your talents.

35:27.210 --> 35:28.150
I'm in.

35:28.617 --> 35:29.966
Welcome to the Brotherhood.

35:33.216 --> 35:34.582
Careful with this one.

35:34.873 --> 35:36.070
Cain Marko.

35:36.072 --> 35:37.555
Solitary confinement.

35:37.879 --> 35:39.142
Check this out.

35:39.547 --> 35:41.691
Prisoner must be confined at all times.

35:41.693 --> 35:45.112
If he builds any momentum,
no object can stop him.

35:45.395 --> 35:46.611
How fascinating.

35:49.357 --> 35:50.633
What do they call you?

35:51.270 --> 35:52.470
Juggernaut.

35:52.766 --> 35:54.141
I can't imagine why.

35:54.776 --> 35:56.628
Are you going to let me out of here?
I need a pee.

36:08.793 --> 36:09.726
Nice helmet.

36:10.302 --> 36:11.528
Keeps my face pretty.

36:12.717 --> 36:14.806
I think he'll make a fine addition
to our army.

36:15.101 --> 36:15.715
Yeah.

36:16.644 --> 36:17.586
No!

36:43.949 --> 36:45.534
You saved me.

36:50.295 --> 36:51.291
Eric.

36:54.172 --> 36:55.586
I'm sorry, my dear.

36:57.266 --> 36:59.086
You're not one of us anymore.

37:05.097 --> 37:06.415
Such a shame.

37:06.799 --> 37:08.318
She was so beautiful.

37:14.484 --> 37:16.551
You think resigning
will make a difference?

37:16.553 --> 37:18.321
That's no way to influence policy.

37:18.370 --> 37:20.471
Policy is being made
without me, Mr President.

37:21.327 --> 37:24.168
The decision to turn the cure into
a weapon was made without me.

37:24.692 --> 37:26.895
What happened on that
convoy was inexcusable.

37:27.363 --> 37:28.445
But your actions...

37:28.447 --> 37:30.193
Hank, that was an isolated incident.

37:30.373 --> 37:31.633
You have to understand,

37:31.753 --> 37:33.789
those mutants were a real threat.

37:34.094 --> 37:36.308
Have you even begun to think
what a slippery slope you're on?

37:38.049 --> 37:39.076
I have.

37:41.844 --> 37:44.345
And I worry about
how democracy survives

37:44.471 --> 37:46.633
when one man can move
cities with his mind.

37:47.172 --> 37:48.250
As do I.

37:52.355 --> 37:54.922
You and I know that it's
only going to get worse.

37:55.149 --> 37:57.430
All the more reason why
I need to be where I belong.

38:27.632 --> 38:28.319
Jean.

38:33.229 --> 38:34.459
Hi, Logan.

38:35.054 --> 38:36.018
Welcome back.

38:39.152 --> 38:40.761
Back where we first met.

38:41.226 --> 38:44.088
Only I was in your place
and you were in mine.

38:45.742 --> 38:46.703
Are you ok?

38:49.579 --> 38:50.246
Yeah.

38:53.791 --> 38:54.753
More than ok.

39:08.056 --> 39:09.760
Logan, you're making me blush.

39:12.185 --> 39:13.526
You're reading my thoughts?

39:14.239 --> 39:15.285
I don't have to.

39:18.941 --> 39:19.978
It's ok.

39:35.371 --> 39:36.324
It's ok.

40:15.998 --> 40:17.556
Wait.
No.

40:24.048 --> 40:24.948
Jean.

40:25.842 --> 40:27.623
This isn't you.
Yes.

40:28.045 --> 40:29.009
Yes, it is me.

40:29.494 --> 40:30.293
No.

40:30.529 --> 40:32.162
Maybe you ought to take it easy?

40:33.182 --> 40:35.612
The professor said you might be...

40:37.217 --> 40:38.225
different.

40:40.148 --> 40:41.619
He would know, would not he?

40:42.692 --> 40:43.441
What?

40:43.778 --> 40:45.678
You think he's not in your head too?

40:46.529 --> 40:47.887
Look at you, Logan.

40:49.123 --> 40:50.655
He's tamed you.

40:55.413 --> 40:56.735
Where's Scott?

41:00.877 --> 41:01.786
Jean?

41:04.022 --> 41:05.342
Where am I?

41:05.664 --> 41:07.194
You're in the mansion.

41:08.493 --> 41:10.657
You need to tell me
what happened to Scott.

41:14.990 --> 41:15.721
Jean?

41:16.340 --> 41:17.684
Tell me what happened to him?

41:29.644 --> 41:30.489
God.

41:38.936 --> 41:39.824
Look at me.

41:43.589 --> 41:44.500
Stay with me.

41:46.187 --> 41:47.208
Talk to me.

41:47.464 --> 41:49.256
Look at me. Look at me.
No.

41:49.406 --> 41:50.803
Focus. Focus, Jean!

41:52.887 --> 41:53.845
Kill me.

41:55.765 --> 41:56.613
What?

41:56.615 --> 41:58.633
Kill me before I kill someone else.

41:58.741 --> 41:59.906
Don't say that.
Please.

42:00.311 --> 42:01.147
Stop it.

42:02.030 --> 42:02.961
Kill me.

42:05.066 --> 42:06.805
Stop it. Look at me. Look at me.

42:06.807 --> 42:07.392
Jean.

42:07.783 --> 42:08.734
It'll be alright.

42:09.200 --> 42:10.267
We can help you.

42:10.738 --> 42:13.657
Hey. The professor can help.
He can fix it.

42:13.824 --> 42:15.502
I don't want to fix it.

42:27.105 --> 42:28.257
Voluntary?

42:28.624 --> 42:30.800
They put the cure in a gun.

42:32.301 --> 42:34.386
I told you they would draw first blood.

42:34.554 --> 42:35.728
So what do we do?

42:36.041 --> 42:37.056
What do we do?

42:37.223 --> 42:38.765
We use this weapon,

42:38.767 --> 42:42.057
as a lightning rod to bring
countless more to our cause.

42:43.813 --> 42:45.998
Come. We have an army to build.

42:49.652 --> 42:51.026
I picked something up.

42:51.821 --> 42:53.496
An electromagnetic force.

42:53.498 --> 42:54.776
It's massive.

42:55.157 --> 42:57.033
It's a mutant.

42:57.702 --> 42:58.828
Class five.

42:59.445 --> 43:01.789
More powerful than
anything I've ever felt.

43:02.401 --> 43:03.936
More powerful than you.

43:07.336 --> 43:08.422
Where is she?

43:11.942 --> 43:12.995
Logan.

43:14.385 --> 43:16.428
Jean. Jean.
What happened?

43:16.908 --> 43:18.026
What have you done?

43:23.185 --> 43:24.666
I think she killed Scott.

43:24.668 --> 43:25.422
What?

43:27.982 --> 43:29.244
That's not possible.

43:29.613 --> 43:30.904
I warned you.

43:36.699 --> 43:39.565
She's left the mansion,
but she's trying to block my thoughts.

43:39.989 --> 43:41.274
She's so strong.

43:44.362 --> 43:45.664
It may be too late.

43:50.880 --> 43:52.589
Wait for me here.
What?

43:52.757 --> 43:54.568
I need to see Jean alone.

43:55.659 --> 43:57.355
You were right, Charles.

43:57.887 --> 43:59.477
This one is special.

43:59.644 --> 44:01.153
What the hell are you doing here?

44:01.390 --> 44:02.943
Same as the professor.

44:02.945 --> 44:04.268
Visiting an old friend.

44:04.435 --> 44:05.779
I don't want trouble here.

44:05.781 --> 44:06.741
Nor do I, Charles.

44:06.904 --> 44:08.677
So, shall we go inside?

44:11.233 --> 44:13.731
I came to bring Jean home.
Don't interfere, Eric.

44:13.832 --> 44:15.543
Just like old times?

44:15.597 --> 44:16.940
She needs help.

44:16.942 --> 44:18.405
Jean is not well.

44:19.033 --> 44:21.274
Funny, you sound just like her parents.

44:22.912 --> 44:24.431
Nobody gets inside.

45:11.127 --> 45:12.576
I knew you'd come.

45:12.578 --> 45:13.583
Of course.

45:13.746 --> 45:15.215
I've come to bring you home.

45:15.545 --> 45:17.583
I have no home.
Yes, you do.

45:17.726 --> 45:19.406
You have a home and a family.

45:19.445 --> 45:22.804
You know he thinks your power
is too great for you to control.

45:23.166 --> 45:23.734
Eric.

45:23.736 --> 45:26.850
I don't believe your mind games
are going to work any more, Charles.

45:27.017 --> 45:28.706
So you want to control me?

45:28.836 --> 45:29.812
No he does.

45:30.065 --> 45:32.254
No. I want to help you.

45:32.773 --> 45:33.681
Help me?

45:35.009 --> 45:36.318
What's wrong with me?

45:36.485 --> 45:38.412
Absolutely nothing.
Eric, stop!

45:38.414 --> 45:40.002
No, Charles, not this time.

45:40.305 --> 45:41.610
You've always held her back.

45:41.739 --> 45:43.467
For your own good, Jean.

45:45.406 --> 45:47.120
Stay out of my head.

45:50.166 --> 45:51.162
I'm going in.

45:51.971 --> 45:53.469
The professor said he'd handle this.

46:00.134 --> 46:01.366
Look at me, Jean.

46:02.006 --> 46:04.054
I can help you. Look at me.

46:04.221 --> 46:05.857
Get out of my head.

46:07.892 --> 46:09.818
Perhaps you should listen to her,
Charles.

46:09.843 --> 46:12.753
You must trust me. You're a danger
to everyone and yourself.

46:12.897 --> 46:14.221
But I can help you.

46:14.223 --> 46:16.084
I think you want to give her the cure.

46:16.358 --> 46:17.785
Look what happened to Scott.

46:18.348 --> 46:20.952
You killed the man you loved because
you couldn't control your power.

46:21.096 --> 46:22.989
No! Stop it!

46:25.493 --> 46:26.576
That's it.

47:09.703 --> 47:12.163
Jean, let me in.

48:14.903 --> 48:15.661
No, Jean.

48:16.687 --> 48:17.681
Jean!

49:17.539 --> 49:19.874
Don't let it control you.

49:28.926 --> 49:29.732
Charles.

49:57.413 --> 49:58.375
My dear.

49:59.024 --> 50:00.259
Come with me.

50:14.972 --> 50:15.854
No.

50:20.269 --> 50:21.153
God!

50:56.930 --> 50:59.140
We live in an age of darkness.

51:00.142 --> 51:01.863
A world full of fear,

51:02.497 --> 51:03.399
hate,

51:03.627 --> 51:04.936
and intolerance.

51:05.689 --> 51:07.099
But in every age,

51:07.101 --> 51:09.283
there are those who fight against it.

51:10.152 --> 51:13.520
Charles Xavier was born
to a world divided.

51:15.761 --> 51:17.753
A world he tried to heal.

51:18.827 --> 51:21.621
A mission he never saw accomplished.

51:22.331 --> 51:25.032
It seems the destiny of great men,

51:25.034 --> 51:26.845
to see their goals unfulfilled.

51:27.669 --> 51:29.613
Charles was more than a leader,

51:29.834 --> 51:31.309
more than a teacher.

51:31.473 --> 51:32.842
He was a friend.

51:33.675 --> 51:35.069
When we were afraid,

51:35.289 --> 51:36.569
he gave us strength.

51:37.179 --> 51:38.610
And when we were alone,

51:38.901 --> 51:40.183
he gave us a family.

51:41.725 --> 51:43.092
He may be gone,

51:43.667 --> 51:46.648
but his teachings live on through us,

51:47.042 --> 51:48.109
his students.

51:48.982 --> 51:50.315
Wherever we may go,

51:50.443 --> 51:52.361
we must carry on his vision.

51:52.528 --> 51:53.693
And that's a vision...

51:54.522 --> 51:56.409
of a world united.

52:20.681 --> 52:21.546
Kitty.

52:23.559 --> 52:24.360
Bobby.

52:28.522 --> 52:29.906
You ok?
Yeah.

52:34.695 --> 52:35.678
It's just,

52:36.930 --> 52:38.861
Xavier came to my house.

52:40.242 --> 52:42.709
He was the one
that convinced me to come here.

52:43.120 --> 52:44.273
Yeah, me too.

52:45.289 --> 52:46.861
We're all feeling
the same way, you know.

52:46.863 --> 52:48.248
No, Bobby, we're not.

52:49.842 --> 52:51.052
You have Rogue and I have...

52:53.632 --> 52:55.883
You know, I just miss home.

52:57.301 --> 52:59.006
The first snow and all that.

53:02.264 --> 53:03.863
Kitty, get up. Come with me.

53:04.268 --> 53:05.966
Storm told us to stay in our rooms.

53:05.968 --> 53:07.478
Don't worry. We won't get caught.

53:08.312 --> 53:10.240
I mean, you can walk
through walls, you know.

53:11.106 --> 53:11.682
Come on.

53:24.926 --> 53:26.323
This place can be home too.

54:06.370 --> 54:08.192
Thank you for this, Bobby.

54:25.803 --> 54:27.014
You need a lift, kid?

54:27.933 --> 54:28.716
No.

54:32.020 --> 54:33.057
Where are you going?

54:35.607 --> 54:38.192
You don't know what it's like
to be afraid of your powers,

54:38.360 --> 54:40.076
afraid to get close to anybody.

54:40.404 --> 54:41.235
Yeah,

54:41.502 --> 54:42.380
I do.

54:44.026 --> 54:46.167
I want to be able
to touch people, Logan.

54:47.703 --> 54:48.470
A hug.

54:49.200 --> 54:50.081
A handshake.

54:51.290 --> 54:52.162
A kiss.

54:53.405 --> 54:55.143
I hope you're not doing
this for some boy.

54:58.547 --> 55:00.844
Look, if you wanna go, then go.

55:02.007 --> 55:03.396
Just be sure it's what you want.

55:06.054 --> 55:07.975
Shouldn't you be telling me to stay?

55:09.046 --> 55:10.850
To go upstairs and unpack?

55:11.101 --> 55:12.285
I'm not your father.

55:12.287 --> 55:13.305
I'm your friend.

55:16.708 --> 55:18.278
Just think about what I said, Rogue.

55:19.653 --> 55:20.339
Marie.

55:22.379 --> 55:23.163
Marie.

56:02.178 --> 56:04.342
Do you remember when we first met?

56:05.545 --> 56:06.841
Do you know what I saw,

56:07.213 --> 56:08.408
when I looked at you?

56:09.211 --> 56:11.354
I saw the next stage in evolution,

56:12.785 --> 56:14.956
both Charles and I dreamt of finding.

56:16.562 --> 56:18.656
And I thought to myself,
why would Charles

56:19.458 --> 56:22.712
want to turn this goddess into a mortal?

56:27.302 --> 56:29.059
I can manipulate,

56:29.061 --> 56:30.586
the metal in this,

56:31.511 --> 56:32.220
but you,

56:32.853 --> 56:34.505
you can do anything.

56:34.976 --> 56:37.228
Anything you can think of.

56:47.823 --> 56:48.787
Jean.

56:50.158 --> 56:50.959
Enough.

56:54.062 --> 56:54.917
Enough!

56:57.874 --> 56:59.540
You sound just like him.

57:00.293 --> 57:01.053
Jean,

57:01.489 --> 57:03.085
he wanted to hold you back.

57:03.747 --> 57:04.901
What do you want?

57:04.903 --> 57:06.834
I want you to be what you are.

57:08.369 --> 57:09.612
As nature intended.

57:12.264 --> 57:14.333
That cure is meant for all of us.

57:14.897 --> 57:16.305
If we want freedom,

57:16.307 --> 57:17.895
we must fight for it.

57:19.688 --> 57:21.793
And that fight begins now.

57:30.659 --> 57:32.396
She should not be here with us.

57:33.578 --> 57:35.792
Her power is completely unstable.

57:35.800 --> 57:37.205
Only in the wrong hands.

57:37.372 --> 57:39.121
And you trust her?
She's one of them.

57:39.429 --> 57:40.750
So were you once.

57:41.037 --> 57:42.490
I stuck with you all the way.

57:42.636 --> 57:44.947
Would have killed the professor
if you'd given me the chance.

57:46.882 --> 57:49.807
Charles Xavier did more for
mutants than you'll ever know.

57:51.235 --> 57:55.632
My single greatest regret is that he
had to die for our dream to live.

58:13.003 --> 58:13.961
So what now?

58:14.778 --> 58:15.702
What do we do?

58:15.704 --> 58:19.165
Professor Xavier started this school.
Perhaps it's best that it end with him.

58:19.498 --> 58:21.579
We'll have to tell the students
that they're going home.

58:21.933 --> 58:23.647
Most of us don't
have anywhere to go.

58:25.347 --> 58:26.519
I can't believe this.

58:26.989 --> 58:29.051
I can't believe we're not
going to fight for this school.

58:36.090 --> 58:38.016
I'm sorry. I know this is a bad time.

58:39.100 --> 58:41.937
I was told that this was
a safe place for mutants.

58:43.605 --> 58:44.620
It was, son.

58:49.277 --> 58:50.775
And it still is.

58:51.924 --> 58:53.103
We'll find you a room.

58:53.615 --> 58:56.114
Hank, tell all the students
the school stays open.

59:11.723 --> 59:12.339
Rogue.

59:14.594 --> 59:15.308
Hey, Rogue.

59:25.772 --> 59:26.434
Hey, Pete.

59:26.737 --> 59:27.620
Have you seen Rogue?

59:27.942 --> 59:29.058
Yeah, she took off.

59:43.456 --> 59:44.402
<i>Logan.</i>

59:45.629 --> 59:46.578
<i>Logan.</i>

59:47.642 --> 59:48.435
<i>Logan.</i>

59:49.024 --> 59:49.665
Jean?

59:49.921 --> 59:52.073
<i>Logan. Where am I? Logan.</i>

59:52.606 --> 59:54.174
<i>Logan. Logan.</i>

59:54.342 --> 59:55.541
<i>Logan.</i>
Stop.

59:56.761 --> 59:59.054
<i>Logan. Logan. Logan.</i>

01:00:19.951 --> 01:00:20.987
Where are you going?

01:00:20.989 --> 01:00:22.051
Where do you think?

01:00:22.746 --> 01:00:24.023
She's gone, Logan.

01:00:24.025 --> 01:00:26.285
She's not coming back.
You don't know that.

01:00:26.848 --> 01:00:28.397
She killed the professor.

01:00:29.314 --> 01:00:30.458
It wasn't Jean.

01:00:31.019 --> 01:00:32.823
The Jean I know is still in there.

01:00:34.466 --> 01:00:35.416
Listen.
Alright.

01:00:35.531 --> 01:00:36.885
Why can't you see the truth?

01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:38.712
Why can't you just let her go?

01:00:38.714 --> 01:00:39.528
Because,

01:00:40.165 --> 01:00:40.973
Because,

01:00:41.084 --> 01:00:42.201
Because you love her.

01:00:52.734 --> 01:00:54.228
She made her choice.

01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:55.610
Now it's time we make ours.

01:00:55.830 --> 01:00:57.870
So if you're with us, then be with us.

01:01:12.087 --> 01:01:27.038
We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure!

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:30.186
Getting the cure so you can go
back home to mommy and daddy?

01:01:32.755 --> 01:01:34.136
I'm looking for someone.

01:01:36.537 --> 01:01:37.796
I get it.

01:01:38.641 --> 01:01:39.648
Your girlfriend.

01:01:40.907 --> 01:01:42.520
I figured she'd want the cure.

01:01:43.114 --> 01:01:44.263
She's pathetic.

01:01:49.082 --> 01:01:50.345
Come on, lceman.

01:01:52.830 --> 01:01:53.981
Make a move.

01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:01.646
Same old Bobby.

01:02:02.570 --> 01:02:04.218
Still afraid of a fight.

01:02:16.442 --> 01:02:19.207
<i>Today's attack was only our first salvo.</i>

01:02:19.654 --> 01:02:21.676
<i>So long as the cure exists,</i>

01:02:21.932 --> 01:02:23.598
<i>our war will rage.</i>

01:02:23.759 --> 01:02:25.688
<i>Your cities will not be safe.</i>

01:02:25.690 --> 01:02:27.550
<i>Your streets will not be safe.</i>

01:02:27.749 --> 01:02:29.503
<i>You will not be safe.</i>

01:02:30.467 --> 01:02:32.108
<i>And to my fellow mutants,</i>

01:02:32.815 --> 01:02:34.244
<i>I make you this offer,</i>

01:02:34.277 --> 01:02:36.945
<i>join us or stay out of our way.</i>

01:02:37.347 --> 01:02:39.967
<i>Enough mutant blood
has been spilled already.</i>

01:02:42.343 --> 01:02:44.634
We're trying to track them, sir.
We're working hard.

01:02:47.974 --> 01:02:49.782
We cannot let him do this.

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:51.650
You know I agree, sir.

01:02:52.335 --> 01:02:54.387
This is now a national security matter.

01:02:54.518 --> 01:02:56.262
Seize and secure Worthington Labs.

01:02:56.395 --> 01:02:59.135
I want troops armed with cure
weapons deployed immediately.

01:02:59.137 --> 01:02:59.903
Yes, sir.

01:02:59.999 --> 01:03:01.020
And Trask,

01:03:01.022 --> 01:03:03.555
you have to find Magneto
and stop him,

01:03:03.838 --> 01:03:05.476
by any means necessary.

01:03:06.367 --> 01:03:07.826
Magneto wants a war.

01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:09.453
We'll give him one.

01:03:10.209 --> 01:03:12.289
Let's go. Keep it moving.

01:03:12.546 --> 01:03:14.182
Turn in your old weapon.

01:03:14.475 --> 01:03:15.983
Turn in all metal.

01:03:16.303 --> 01:03:17.274
Bayonets,

01:03:17.366 --> 01:03:19.714
magazines, dog tags.

01:03:19.881 --> 01:03:21.902
Pick up your plastic weapons.

01:03:22.275 --> 01:03:24.041
Pick up your cure cartridge.

01:03:24.177 --> 01:03:26.136
Absolutely no metal.

01:03:36.356 --> 01:03:54.787
We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure!

01:06:10.093 --> 01:06:12.219
They wish to cure us.

01:06:12.396 --> 01:06:13.889
But I say to you.

01:06:14.101 --> 01:06:16.086
We are the cure!

01:06:18.559 --> 01:06:23.689
The cure for that infirm, imperfect
condition called, homo sapiens.

01:06:25.858 --> 01:06:27.624
They have their weapons.

01:06:28.973 --> 01:06:30.343
We have ours.

01:06:33.254 --> 01:06:35.606
We will strike with a vengeance

01:06:35.961 --> 01:06:39.326
and a fury that this world
has never witnessed.

01:06:40.707 --> 01:06:43.183
And if any mutants,

01:06:43.185 --> 01:06:47.088
stand in our way we will
use this poison against them.

01:06:48.008 --> 01:06:50.099
We shall go to Alcatraz lsland,

01:06:50.883 --> 01:06:52.801
take control of the cure,

01:06:53.126 --> 01:06:55.303
and destroy its source.

01:06:55.502 --> 01:06:59.172
And then nothing can stop us.

01:07:14.717 --> 01:07:15.340
Jean.

01:07:28.733 --> 01:07:31.902
I know the smell of your
adamantium from a mile away.

01:07:32.339 --> 01:07:34.041
I didn't come here to fight you.

01:07:34.043 --> 01:07:35.051
Smart boy.

01:07:35.203 --> 01:07:36.504
I came for Jean.

01:07:36.606 --> 01:07:38.738
You think I'm keeping
her against her will?

01:07:49.317 --> 01:07:51.407
She's here because she wants to be.

01:07:51.771 --> 01:07:53.263
You don't know what
you're dealing with.

01:07:53.422 --> 01:07:54.816
I know full well.

01:07:54.868 --> 01:07:56.955
I saw what she did to Charles.

01:07:57.416 --> 01:07:59.583
And you stood there and let him die?

01:08:00.661 --> 01:08:02.668
I'm not leaving here without her.

01:08:03.248 --> 01:08:04.311
Yes, you are.

01:08:17.678 --> 01:08:18.353
Ok.

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:22.553
Two minutes till rendezvous,
Mr President.

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:28.680
We have a satellite feed
of Magneto's base of operations.

01:08:32.527 --> 01:08:33.740
How did we find it?

01:08:34.439 --> 01:08:36.488
She gave us everything
we wanted and more.

01:08:38.464 --> 01:08:41.225
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

01:09:16.571 --> 01:09:18.259
<i>Approaching target dead ahead.</i>

01:09:20.707 --> 01:09:22.932
<i>Set for 360-degree incursion.</i>

01:09:35.381 --> 01:09:37.078
This is Team Leader to Bravo One.

01:09:37.312 --> 01:09:38.939
<i>We are green to go.</i>

01:09:43.598 --> 01:09:44.371
Ok.

01:09:44.484 --> 01:09:45.667
Send them in.

01:09:45.857 --> 01:09:46.426
Ok.

01:09:46.935 --> 01:09:49.062
Freeze, mutants!
Get your hands in the air!

01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:50.761
Hands in the air!

01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:07.118
Ok.

01:10:07.962 --> 01:10:08.884
I give up.

01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:12.042
<i>Sorry, Mr Secretary, it was a decoy.</i>

01:10:12.210 --> 01:10:14.304
If he's not there,
then where the hell is he?

01:10:23.346 --> 01:10:24.989
Worthington Labs.

01:10:24.991 --> 01:10:27.060
It ends where it began.

01:10:27.683 --> 01:10:29.475
Are you sure the boy is still inside?

01:10:29.575 --> 01:10:30.978
A 100%.

01:10:31.145 --> 01:10:32.601
So how are we supposed to get there?

01:10:33.308 --> 01:10:34.566
Cos I don't swim.

01:10:35.483 --> 01:10:36.784
Leave that to me.

01:10:42.615 --> 01:10:43.564
Storm.

01:10:44.785 --> 01:10:45.743
Storm.

01:10:45.991 --> 01:10:47.449
What are you doing back here?

01:10:48.829 --> 01:10:49.855
I need help.

01:10:50.915 --> 01:10:52.260
You found her.
Yeah.

01:10:52.262 --> 01:10:53.484
She's with Magneto.

01:10:53.834 --> 01:10:54.811
Where are they?

01:10:55.051 --> 01:10:56.959
On the move.
I know where they're going.

01:10:56.961 --> 01:10:59.379
You're saying you saw Magneto?
Yeah, we got to go now.

01:10:59.821 --> 01:11:01.364
They're gonna attack Alcatraz.

01:11:02.176 --> 01:11:05.210
There are troops stationed on that island.
Not enough to stop him.

01:11:05.763 --> 01:11:06.738
Let's suit up.

01:11:11.978 --> 01:11:13.603
Hard to believe this once fit me.

01:11:13.771 --> 01:11:16.276
If Magneto gets hold of that cure,
we will no stopping him.

01:11:16.377 --> 01:11:17.880
Can you estimate how many he has?

01:11:17.882 --> 01:11:19.412
An army. And Jean.

01:11:19.453 --> 01:11:21.518
His powers have limits, hers do not.

01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:22.954
There's only six of us, Logan.

01:11:26.617 --> 01:11:28.156
Yeah. We're outnumbered.

01:11:29.203 --> 01:11:30.243
I'm not gonna lie to you.

01:11:31.872 --> 01:11:33.068
But we lost Scott.

01:11:34.292 --> 01:11:35.523
We lost the professor.

01:11:36.544 --> 01:11:39.603
If we don't fight now, everything
they stood for will die with them.

01:11:42.174 --> 01:11:43.445
I'm not gonna let that happen.

01:11:44.552 --> 01:11:45.343
Are you?

01:11:47.885 --> 01:11:49.093
Then we stand together.

01:11:51.058 --> 01:11:51.944
X-Men.

01:11:53.561 --> 01:11:54.550
All of us.

01:12:02.194 --> 01:12:02.872
We're in.

01:12:04.697 --> 01:12:05.425
Let's go.

01:12:10.745 --> 01:12:11.954
They're ready.

01:12:12.834 --> 01:12:13.712
Yeah, I know.

01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:15.900
But are you ready

01:12:16.425 --> 01:12:18.674
to do what you need
to do when the time comes?

01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:48.931
Dad, what's going on?

01:13:50.928 --> 01:13:52.126
It's an earthquake.

01:13:56.584 --> 01:13:57.509
We're trapped.

01:16:02.616 --> 01:16:05.632
Charles always wanted to build bridges.

01:16:21.333 --> 01:16:23.196
My God.

01:16:48.063 --> 01:16:51.524
Fall back! Take cover! Fall back!

01:17:06.874 --> 01:17:08.937
The boy's in the southeast
corner of the building.

01:17:11.045 --> 01:17:11.877
Well, then.

01:17:12.448 --> 01:17:14.568
Let's take it down!

01:17:31.307 --> 01:17:33.693
In chess, the pawns go first.

01:17:36.992 --> 01:17:38.976
Humans and their guns.

01:17:48.276 --> 01:17:49.216
Plastic.

01:17:49.806 --> 01:17:51.031
They've learned.

01:17:57.132 --> 01:17:59.530
That's why the pawns go first.

01:18:09.561 --> 01:18:10.666
Target the bridge.

01:18:18.989 --> 01:18:20.009
Fire!

01:18:27.454 --> 01:18:28.393
Arclight!

01:18:28.675 --> 01:18:30.510
Use your shockwaves.

01:18:30.512 --> 01:18:31.620
Target those weapons.

01:18:51.979 --> 01:18:53.834
My stars and garters.

01:18:54.522 --> 01:18:56.030
Go into stealth mode.

01:18:58.610 --> 01:19:00.148
What about jets? Tanks?

01:19:00.150 --> 01:19:01.292
Against Magneto?

01:19:01.294 --> 01:19:02.588
He'll turn them inside out.

01:19:02.823 --> 01:19:04.350
Where are our ground troops?

01:19:04.352 --> 01:19:05.538
30 minutes away.

01:19:07.494 --> 01:19:08.930
Then God help us.

01:19:19.204 --> 01:19:20.555
They're coming for him.

01:19:55.250 --> 01:19:56.490
Don't ever do that again.

01:20:04.349 --> 01:20:05.733
You men cover the doors!

01:20:06.219 --> 01:20:07.695
Everybody get together!

01:20:08.141 --> 01:20:09.625
And hold this line!

01:20:25.447 --> 01:20:27.686
Traitors to their own cause.

01:20:34.414 --> 01:20:35.730
Finish them!

01:21:12.286 --> 01:21:13.425
Not yet.

01:21:29.104 --> 01:21:31.387
Go inside and get the boy.
And kill him.

01:21:31.812 --> 01:21:32.823
With pleasure.

01:21:39.438 --> 01:21:42.148
Hold it!

01:21:43.984 --> 01:21:45.758
He's going for the boy!

01:21:46.153 --> 01:21:47.503
Not if I get there first.

01:21:48.488 --> 01:21:49.096
Kitty!

01:22:00.972 --> 01:22:01.918
Come on.

01:22:06.439 --> 01:22:07.460
Grow those back.

01:22:18.685 --> 01:22:20.139
Don't you know who I am?

01:22:21.688 --> 01:22:23.986
I'm the Juggernaut, bitch.

01:22:56.223 --> 01:22:57.403
Going somewhere?

01:23:01.812 --> 01:23:03.762
You're the guy that
invented the cure, right?

01:23:04.564 --> 01:23:06.151
Yes, I am.

01:23:07.566 --> 01:23:08.358
Girls.

01:23:09.277 --> 01:23:11.570
No. Don't. Don't hurt him.

01:23:11.738 --> 01:23:14.214
No. Don't hurt him.
Let go of me. I didn't do anything.

01:23:15.261 --> 01:23:16.925
Calm down. Calm down.

01:23:17.411 --> 01:23:19.011
Everything's gonna be ok.

01:23:37.690 --> 01:23:38.967
I thought you were a diplomat.

01:23:39.070 --> 01:23:41.644
As Churchill said, There comes
a time when all men must,

01:23:44.115 --> 01:23:45.224
you get the point.

01:23:46.635 --> 01:23:48.001
Oh no. No!

01:23:48.309 --> 01:23:49.484
Please, no, no, don't.

01:23:49.651 --> 01:23:50.199
No.

01:23:57.075 --> 01:23:59.173
No, don't worry.
I'm here to help you.

01:23:59.175 --> 01:24:00.608
I'm going to get you out of here.

01:24:03.290 --> 01:24:04.190
This way.

01:24:05.667 --> 01:24:07.368
Oh my God. What's going on?

01:24:07.370 --> 01:24:09.062
Your powers won't work with me.

01:24:14.301 --> 01:24:15.779
Stay close, alright?
Ok.

01:24:20.136 --> 01:24:22.346
I'm the wrong guy
to play hide-and-seek with.

01:24:22.476 --> 01:24:24.810
Who's hiding, dickhead?

01:24:36.670 --> 01:24:38.261
Don't. No.

01:24:39.159 --> 01:24:40.674
No, don't.

01:24:41.036 --> 01:24:42.697
Please, don't do this.

01:24:42.972 --> 01:24:44.748
I only wanted to help you people.

01:24:45.665 --> 01:24:47.578
Do we look like we need your help?

01:25:18.031 --> 01:25:20.199
It's time to end this war.

01:25:30.961 --> 01:25:32.181
Take cover.

01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:37.258
Get out of the way.

01:25:48.478 --> 01:25:50.400
Let's go.
Move.

01:25:52.773 --> 01:25:54.023
Go! Go! Go!

01:26:42.503 --> 01:26:43.924
We work as a team.

01:26:45.493 --> 01:26:47.125
Best defense is a good offense.

01:26:54.338 --> 01:26:55.188
Bobby.

01:26:55.484 --> 01:26:57.147
Can you take out your old friend?

01:27:10.477 --> 01:27:11.764
Go ahead.

01:27:13.936 --> 01:27:14.684
Storm,

01:27:14.686 --> 01:27:16.141
we're gonna need some cover.

01:27:16.787 --> 01:27:17.576
Right.

01:28:07.033 --> 01:28:09.168
You're in over your head, Bobby.

01:28:10.606 --> 01:28:12.533
Maybe you should go back to school.

01:28:24.050 --> 01:28:25.188
You never should have left.

01:28:27.554 --> 01:28:28.617
This is it.

01:28:29.748 --> 01:28:30.574
Hey.

01:28:31.975 --> 01:28:33.437
Make it a strike.

01:28:45.572 --> 01:28:48.046
You never learn, do you?

01:28:49.701 --> 01:28:50.992
Actually...

01:28:52.012 --> 01:28:53.084
I do.

01:29:06.718 --> 01:29:07.794
I'm...

01:29:09.012 --> 01:29:10.180
One of them?

01:29:21.775 --> 01:29:25.110
This is what they want for all of us.

01:29:46.132 --> 01:29:47.603
It's over, Jean.

01:29:50.470 --> 01:29:51.586
It's over.

01:29:55.767 --> 01:29:57.162
No! Don't shoot!

01:30:11.350 --> 01:30:12.870
No!

01:30:29.676 --> 01:30:31.490
Everybody get out of there!

01:30:41.271 --> 01:30:42.140
Bobby!

01:30:53.408 --> 01:30:54.848
What have I done?

01:31:06.296 --> 01:31:08.418
I'm the only one who can stop her.

01:31:08.968 --> 01:31:10.337
Get everyone to safety.

01:31:10.758 --> 01:31:11.592
Go.

01:31:16.806 --> 01:31:18.111
Jean!

01:32:04.014 --> 01:32:04.801
Jean!

01:32:05.939 --> 01:32:07.321
I know you're still there!

01:32:54.821 --> 01:32:56.387
You would die for them?

01:32:58.616 --> 01:33:00.617
No, not for them.

01:33:01.911 --> 01:33:02.874
For you.

01:33:06.303 --> 01:33:07.317
For you.

01:33:12.964 --> 01:33:13.959
Save me.

01:33:16.843 --> 01:33:17.781
I love you.

01:34:57.902 --> 01:34:58.769
You're back.

01:35:06.828 --> 01:35:07.859
I'm sorry.

01:35:09.497 --> 01:35:10.431
I had to.

01:35:12.333 --> 01:35:13.877
This isn't what I wanted.

01:35:14.316 --> 01:35:15.244
I know.

01:35:16.462 --> 01:35:17.699
It's what I want.

01:35:31.185 --> 01:35:32.213
Hey.

01:35:33.813 --> 01:35:34.987
Good to see you, buddy.

01:35:36.190 --> 01:35:38.950
<i>With the thanks of a grateful nation</i>

01:35:39.103 --> 01:35:42.154
