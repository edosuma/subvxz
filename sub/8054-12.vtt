00:12.239 --> 00:13.573
- You are getting
a rare glimpse

00:13.641 --> 00:16.341
At this exclusive,
government-only event.

00:16.410 --> 00:18.898
Each December, one department
puts on a show

00:18.965 --> 00:20.366
That spoofs what happened
in our town.

00:20.434 --> 00:22.465
Prepare to laugh
your asnov!

00:24.868 --> 00:27.666
Sid asnov is a former
city councilman.

00:27.734 --> 00:29.804
Some of the jokes are
sort of inside.

00:29.872 --> 00:30.978
Councilman dexhart,

00:31.045 --> 00:33.386
You're involved in
yet another scandal?

00:33.453 --> 00:37.067
That's crazier than
mayor gunderson's dog rufus.

00:40.408 --> 00:43.484
- Yes, there is a new one,
and it's a doozy.

00:43.551 --> 00:45.085
I don't want to go
into the details,

00:45.153 --> 00:48.527
But let me just say that
it involves multiple women,

00:48.595 --> 00:54.037
A love child, nurses,
rabbis, priests.

00:56.407 --> 00:57.641
Well, I hope you can all
join me

00:57.709 --> 00:59.377
At my fundraiser tonight.

00:59.445 --> 01:01.079
I am being supported,
of course,

01:01.147 --> 01:03.717
By the glitter factory
and 1-800-mattress.

01:05.590 --> 01:08.026
Ha ha ha ha! Classic.

01:08.094 --> 01:10.129
- Ã¢ÂTÂª pawnee is a city
that ain't very pretty Ã¢ÂTÂª

01:10.196 --> 01:12.300
Ã¢ÂTÂª and good government is
our goal Ã¢ÂTÂª

01:12.368 --> 01:14.303
- Ã¢ÂTÂª we may not be big
and our mayor wears a wig Ã¢ÂTÂª

01:14.371 --> 01:16.205
Ã¢ÂTÂª but at least the raccoon
infestation Ã¢ÂTÂª

01:16.273 --> 01:17.373
Ã¢ÂTÂª is under control Ã¢ÂTÂª

01:17.441 --> 01:22.915
-
Ã¢ÂTÂª it's the most wonderful time Ã¢ÂTÂª

01:22.983 --> 01:29.458
Ã¢ÂTÂª in pawnee Ã¢ÂTÂª

01:33.697 --> 01:41.737
Ã¢ÂTÂª Ã¢ÂTÂª

01:51.014 --> 01:53.984
- Lot 48 was once a horrible
and disgusting pit.

01:54.052 --> 01:57.656
And now it's the site
of pawnee's winter wonderland.

01:57.724 --> 02:00.025
This could not be more perfect
if I had planned it myself.

02:00.093 --> 02:02.596
Which I did.
And it's awesome.

02:02.664 --> 02:03.931
So let's talk schedge, guys.

02:03.999 --> 02:06.367
The kids are gonna come
at 9:00 a.M. On Saturday,

02:06.435 --> 02:09.238
And everyone's gonna do santa
for two hours.

02:09.305 --> 02:10.606
So I would just
advise everyone

02:10.674 --> 02:12.041
Before you get
in your costume

02:12.109 --> 02:14.377
To go to the bathroom so we can
avoid what happened last year.

02:14.445 --> 02:16.179
It was just farts.

02:16.247 --> 02:18.316
- 6:00 p.M.,
caroling with the youth choir.

02:18.384 --> 02:20.886
And I am proud to announce,
for the first time ever,

02:20.954 --> 02:22.788
This year
our tree-lighting ceremony

02:22.856 --> 02:24.858
Will be simulcast
on internet radio.

02:24.925 --> 02:27.394
Thank you.

02:27.462 --> 02:30.064
- That's a really big deal.
- It is. Thank you.

02:30.131 --> 02:32.199
- Listening to that tree
lighting's gonna be dope!

02:32.267 --> 02:34.969
- Okay, any questions,
direct them to me--dismissed.

02:35.037 --> 02:39.375
- Hey, uh, there was
a message for you

02:39.443 --> 02:40.510
On the work voicemail.

02:40.577 --> 02:42.178
Councilman dexhart wants
to meet with you

02:42.246 --> 02:44.849
At 9:00 p.M.--
The boardwalk lounge.

02:44.917 --> 02:46.517
- Shut up.
- No.

02:46.585 --> 02:49.988
- I'm not scared.
I got nothing to apologize for.

02:50.055 --> 02:52.024
I could have been
a lot harder on him.

02:52.091 --> 02:53.025
He got off easy.

02:53.092 --> 02:54.493
And often.

02:56.163 --> 02:58.197
Thank you.
I'll be here all week.

02:58.265 --> 03:01.200
- You gotta tell me about him.
I don't know anything about him.

03:01.268 --> 03:03.335
- Okay, he's 23,
he's kinda my boyfriend.

03:03.403 --> 03:04.804
He's gay.

03:04.871 --> 03:06.772
Last year we got drunk and
he took me to the ice capades,

03:06.840 --> 03:08.507
And I didn't get him anything.

03:08.575 --> 03:09.942
And he's gay?
- Yeah.

03:10.010 --> 03:11.310
<i>- Brokeback mountain dvd.</i>

03:11.379 --> 03:12.346
- No.
- Fellas love that.

03:12.413 --> 03:13.447
No.

03:13.515 --> 03:14.781
- Does he already have,
like, chaps?

03:14.849 --> 03:16.950
Like, assless chaps?
- You know what, forget it.

03:17.018 --> 03:18.953
- Okay, uh,
why are you asking me?

03:19.021 --> 03:22.224
- Because, I don't know,
there's no one else to ask.

03:22.291 --> 03:23.759
And at least you're
kind of young.

03:23.827 --> 03:24.961
- All right,
I'll tell you what.

03:25.029 --> 03:26.763
I'm gonna think about it.

03:26.831 --> 03:28.398
Through the course of all day
I'm gonna mull it over.

03:28.466 --> 03:30.267
It's all I'm gonna think about.
But you're in good hands.

03:30.335 --> 03:31.903
I'm gonna come up with something
really, really good.

03:31.970 --> 03:32.904
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:32.972 --> 03:33.972
- All right.
- You got that?

03:34.039 --> 03:37.442
Yeah. Thanks.

03:37.510 --> 03:39.578
- Councilman dexhart,
I'm leslie knope.

03:39.646 --> 03:42.749
- Thank you for meeting me.
- It's my pleasure.

03:42.817 --> 03:44.684
I am assuming this is about
my performance

03:44.752 --> 03:47.054
In the government follies
last night.

03:47.121 --> 03:49.623
I'd just like to say that
I have nothing to apologize for.

03:49.691 --> 03:52.326
Except for perhaps being
too incisive.

03:52.394 --> 03:54.695
- I don't want you
to apologize.

03:54.763 --> 03:56.630
I want to know who told you.

03:56.698 --> 03:57.965
- Who told me?
- Mm-hmm.

03:58.033 --> 04:01.735
- Nobody.
Nobody told me nuttin'!

04:01.803 --> 04:03.471
What are we talking about?

04:03.538 --> 04:04.738
Well, based on that skit,

04:04.806 --> 04:06.240
I know you've heard about
the new scandal

04:06.308 --> 04:07.341
That's about to break.

04:07.409 --> 04:10.077
Who told you?

04:10.145 --> 04:11.312
Was it the babysitter?

04:11.379 --> 04:13.014
Was it the nurse
who delivered our love child?

04:13.081 --> 04:14.349
- What?
- Oh, stop playing dumb.

04:14.416 --> 04:16.250
You know damn well
what happened.

04:16.319 --> 04:18.086
I got the babysitter pregnant.

04:18.154 --> 04:19.688
Then, when she was
in the delivery room,

04:19.755 --> 04:21.523
I had sex with not one

04:21.591 --> 04:24.192
But four nurses
in a supply closet.

04:24.260 --> 04:26.061
As well as a woman
whose husband

04:26.129 --> 04:28.363
Was getting
a liver transplant.

04:28.431 --> 04:29.364
Hmm.

04:29.432 --> 04:32.300
Now, which one of them
told you?

04:32.368 --> 04:33.601
Was it the liver lady?

04:33.669 --> 04:36.971
- Well, I--no one--
I haven't--

04:37.039 --> 04:40.175
I haven't heard any of this ever
in my whole life.

04:40.243 --> 04:41.343
Oh.

04:41.411 --> 04:42.878
- Believe me, I would have
remembered this.

04:42.946 --> 04:45.547
- Okay. Well,
in that case,

04:45.615 --> 04:48.917
Everything I just told you
was just a funny prank.

04:54.723 --> 04:57.291
- Oh, hi.
How was your meeting?

04:57.359 --> 04:59.360
It was fine.

04:59.428 --> 05:00.795
Pretty straightforward.

05:00.862 --> 05:02.796
Short meeting.
You know, he's a busy guy.

05:02.864 --> 05:04.798
- Yes, very busy.
Look at this article.

05:04.865 --> 05:07.066
No!

05:07.134 --> 05:12.204
What the--

05:12.272 --> 05:15.574
- The story of this story is
that it won't stop developing.

05:15.642 --> 05:17.911
The mystery woman who met with
councilman dexhart last night

05:17.978 --> 05:21.847
Appears to be a government
employee named leslie norp.

05:21.915 --> 05:23.649
- Oh, my god.
Oh, god.

05:23.717 --> 05:26.152
<i>- According to unconfirmed
reports in the pawnee sun,</i>

05:26.220 --> 05:29.121
The two bent an elbow
at this local watering hole.

05:29.189 --> 05:30.256
And although they left
separately,

05:30.324 --> 05:33.393
No one knows where
they woke up together.

05:33.461 --> 05:36.797
Perd hapley,
channel 4 news.

05:40.175 --> 05:42.742
- All I did was write and
perform in one amazing skit.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.411
<i>- Leslie,
it's the pawnee sun.</i>

05:44.479 --> 05:45.412
It's a tabloid.

05:45.480 --> 05:46.847
Nobody else has written
about it.

05:46.914 --> 05:48.115
- Yeah, no one believes
that garbage.

05:48.182 --> 05:49.850
Nobody even reads
that thing.

05:49.917 --> 05:52.585
- Leslie, what?
Nice work, girl.

05:52.653 --> 05:54.153
Oh, god.

05:54.221 --> 05:56.521
How do I fight back?
Give me some options.

05:56.589 --> 05:59.725
- Do you want me
to seduce perd hapley?

05:59.792 --> 06:01.060
How would that help?

06:01.127 --> 06:02.794
I don't know.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.930
I just want to see
if I can do it.

06:04.998 --> 06:06.498
- April, I appreciate that,
but I don't think it's something

06:06.566 --> 06:08.300
Worth losing
your virginity over.

06:08.367 --> 06:11.502
- Leslie, I don't know if
this is important or not,

06:11.870 --> 06:14.471
But I have heard a lot of very,
very interesting chatter

06:14.539 --> 06:15.639
Around the shoeshine stand
today.

06:15.706 --> 06:16.973
Oh, my god, really?

06:17.040 --> 06:18.207
What have you heard?
- A lot of things.

06:18.275 --> 06:20.609
Uh, like,
"can you believe it?"

06:20.676 --> 06:22.777
And "the parks lady
boned dexhart."

06:22.845 --> 06:25.712
And "of course she did.
She's totally good to go."

06:25.780 --> 06:28.047
And one guy was like,
"I wouldn't hit that."

06:28.115 --> 06:29.682
And the other guy was like,
"me neither."

06:29.750 --> 06:31.384
Then this third guy
was like, "I would."

06:31.451 --> 06:34.688
So I don't know
if that's helpful at all.

06:34.755 --> 06:37.757
- Well, keep your ear
to the ground.

06:37.825 --> 06:39.459
Okay. I'll just--

06:39.527 --> 06:41.995
- I'm not gonna let
these people intimidate me.

06:42.062 --> 06:44.197
I'm gonna do my job.

06:44.264 --> 06:45.998
I would be lying if I said
that I never thought

06:46.066 --> 06:48.134
I would be involved
in an incident like this.

06:48.201 --> 06:50.870
Except I always assumed that
I would be the politician,

06:50.938 --> 06:53.606
And the man would be accused
of sleeping with me.

06:53.674 --> 06:56.409
And that man would be
the vice president.

06:56.477 --> 06:58.812
And I would be the president.

06:58.879 --> 07:01.281
Okay, all right, well,
you look good.

07:01.348 --> 07:02.615
You need to put
some tights on, though.

07:02.683 --> 07:04.250
And I want you to make sure
you keep your neckline

07:04.318 --> 07:05.485
Nice and high.

07:05.552 --> 07:07.753
<i>- Leslie knope?
Alexa softcastle, pawnee sun.</i>

07:07.821 --> 07:09.421
Can I ask you a few questions?

07:09.489 --> 07:10.522
Don't say anything.

07:10.590 --> 07:12.458
- I'm not afraid
to say anything, okay?

07:12.526 --> 07:13.926
I have nothing to hide.

07:13.994 --> 07:16.595
I've never even met councilman
dexhart before yesterday,

07:16.663 --> 07:18.230
And that's all I want to say
about the matter.

07:18.298 --> 07:19.765
- Some people are saying
this isn't the first time

07:19.832 --> 07:21.766
That you've had sex
with a married councilman.

07:21.834 --> 07:23.634
Who's saying that?

07:23.702 --> 07:25.336
Some people.

07:25.404 --> 07:28.139
Okay, this interview is over.

07:28.207 --> 07:31.142
- Go home, lay low,
the truth will come out.

07:31.210 --> 07:32.844
- I can't.
I have too much work to do.

07:32.911 --> 07:35.680
This department is not gonna
deputy-direct itself.

07:35.747 --> 07:37.148
I think we can manage.

07:37.216 --> 07:41.185
Just give me your schedule
and we'll cover for you.

07:41.253 --> 07:45.757
Okay, I've made copies
of leslie's daily work schedule.

07:45.825 --> 07:47.025
So we'll just split
into teams,

07:47.092 --> 07:51.763
And each team will take...

07:51.831 --> 07:55.767
Damn, ten items...
And we'll knock this out.

07:55.835 --> 07:57.369
- I swear to you,
I never even met the guy

07:57.436 --> 07:58.603
Before last night.

07:58.671 --> 08:00.705
- It's okay.
I believe you.

08:00.773 --> 08:02.040
- You do?
- Of course.

08:02.108 --> 08:05.210
I think I know you
pretty well.

08:05.278 --> 08:06.378
That doesn't sound
like you.

08:06.445 --> 08:07.812
Thank you.

08:07.880 --> 08:09.013
If I ever see that guy,

08:09.081 --> 08:10.281
I'm gonna punch him
right in the face.

08:10.348 --> 08:13.484
- Yeah, that's sweet.
Use your night stick.

08:13.551 --> 08:15.019
Which meeting is this?

08:15.087 --> 08:18.789
- The organization
of local auditing systems.

08:18.857 --> 08:20.958
Kill me.

08:21.026 --> 08:22.660
- All right,
first order of business...

08:22.727 --> 08:25.663
Uh, leslie--
where's leslie?

08:25.730 --> 08:28.932
- Um, I gave her the day off,
paul.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.234
I thought that was best.
- Oh, yeah. That's good.

08:31.302 --> 08:33.870
So you'll be making
the presentation then, ron.

08:33.938 --> 08:37.806
Yep. Yes.

08:37.874 --> 08:40.576
Hey, so, uh...

08:40.643 --> 08:42.744
That kind of brings us to what
I wanted to talk to you about.

08:42.812 --> 08:43.812
I, uh--

08:43.879 --> 08:45.713
You know, my--

08:45.781 --> 08:48.382
Army reserve unit---

08:48.450 --> 08:50.584
We got called up
to active duty.

08:50.652 --> 08:52.520
I ship out in four days.

08:52.587 --> 08:55.423
- Oh, my god.
Where are you going?

08:55.491 --> 08:56.858
San diego.

08:56.926 --> 08:58.093
Oh, my god!

08:58.161 --> 08:59.795
It's not dangerous.

08:59.862 --> 09:01.163
It's mostly maintenance.

09:01.230 --> 09:03.598
But I'm going for,
like, a year.

09:03.666 --> 09:05.467
Maybe 18 months.

09:05.535 --> 09:08.805
And I was kind of hoping
that maybe

09:08.872 --> 09:10.607
You'd want to come with--
with me.

09:10.674 --> 09:14.878
Like on a permanent-type
basis.

09:14.946 --> 09:16.513
I don't know, it's--

09:16.581 --> 09:18.783
It's kind of a weird question.

09:18.851 --> 09:22.354
I mean, I joined
to put myself through college,

09:22.422 --> 09:26.326
And, uh, it's, you know,
I'm just a desk jockey,

09:26.393 --> 09:28.561
But it's--
it's rewarding.

09:28.629 --> 09:33.800
So yeah, I guess I'm in love
with the army.

09:33.868 --> 09:35.368
Oh, leslie.
Well, yeah.

09:35.436 --> 09:38.105
Yeah, that makes
a lot more sense.

09:38.172 --> 09:41.074
Yeah, I'm definitely in love
with leslie.

09:41.142 --> 09:42.809
It's--it's affirmative.

09:42.877 --> 09:45.979
I--I know this seems
kind of fast,

09:46.047 --> 09:47.247
But I feel like we--

09:47.315 --> 09:48.648
I feel like we got
something here.

09:48.716 --> 09:50.817
I do too.

09:50.884 --> 09:52.652
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

09:52.719 --> 09:54.220
- Well, you don't have
to answer right away.

09:54.288 --> 09:57.590
But you kinda do.
I mean, I need to know...Soon.

10:00.693 --> 10:01.860
- Wow.
- Yeah.

10:01.928 --> 10:03.128
Are you gonna go?

10:03.196 --> 10:05.897
- This whole dexhart thing
is not making me feel

10:05.965 --> 10:07.499
Very attached
to pawnee right now.

10:07.567 --> 10:11.002
- San diego, jeez.
- Yeah.

10:11.069 --> 10:12.337
You could learn how to surf.

10:12.404 --> 10:13.704
I know how to surf.

10:13.772 --> 10:15.273
I took lessons
when I was a kid.

10:15.340 --> 10:18.811
I'm actually pretty good.
- I bet you are.

10:18.878 --> 10:21.580
I would miss leslie
like crazy.

10:21.648 --> 10:25.351
Aww...

10:25.419 --> 10:27.821
- All right, sorted out that
payroll issue--this is done.

10:27.889 --> 10:29.823
- "bring a case of beer
to sanitation." why?

10:29.891 --> 10:31.992
- Let's skip that one.
They can buy their own beer.

10:32.059 --> 10:33.726
I'm getting hungry.
Let's get something to eat.

10:33.794 --> 10:35.027
Hey, have you figured out

10:35.095 --> 10:36.228
What you're getting ann
for christmas?

10:36.296 --> 10:38.731
- Oh, I got her a pretty great
computer bag.

10:38.798 --> 10:40.833
- Yeah?
That's a terrible gift.

10:40.901 --> 10:42.768
- No, no, tom,
she needs one.

10:42.836 --> 10:44.437
She mentioned it to me
two months ago,

10:44.504 --> 10:45.871
And I wrote it down.

10:45.939 --> 10:48.207
That's what's called being
an amazing boyfriend.

10:48.275 --> 10:51.476
- Have you seen ann?
You know how hot she is?

10:51.544 --> 10:54.312
Men give women of that caliber
speed boats,

10:54.380 --> 10:57.580
Private jets...
Not computer bags.

10:57.648 --> 10:58.953
- Okay, what do you think
I should get her?

10:59.021 --> 11:00.555
- Diamonds.
Can't go wrong with diamonds.

11:01.023 --> 11:01.757
<i>- Diamonds?</i>

11:01.824 --> 11:03.525
- There isn't a woman alive
who doesn't love diamonds.

11:03.592 --> 11:04.954
Even the super-left-wing chicks

11:05.022 --> 11:06.188
<i>That saw blood diamond
and cried...</i>

11:06.656 --> 11:08.223
When they get a diamond,
they're, like,

11:08.291 --> 11:10.159
"yeah, bitch, gimme more
of them blood diamonds!

11:11.227 --> 11:12.028
Make 'em extra bloody."

11:12.895 --> 11:14.397
Trust me.

11:15.464 --> 11:17.532
- We are here looking
at a videotape.

11:17.600 --> 11:20.135
This is back in April, 2005.

11:20.203 --> 11:21.703
We see here we're looking
at councilman dexhart.

11:21.771 --> 11:22.904
Leslie, you should see this.

11:22.972 --> 11:25.240
- And he's now
about to shake hands

11:25.308 --> 11:28.210
With leslie knope,
the alleged sex toy.

11:28.277 --> 11:30.812
Oh, for cripes sake.

11:30.880 --> 11:33.315
- Look at the way
she's smiling at him.

11:33.382 --> 11:34.883
And then almost unconsciously

11:34.951 --> 11:36.484
Touching her hands
to her hips.

11:36.552 --> 11:38.854
See that? Right there.

11:38.921 --> 11:41.022
It's like she's
sending him a message

11:41.090 --> 11:42.090
That she's ready
for childbearing.

11:42.158 --> 11:44.130
- Wow.
- In a 24-hour news cycle,

11:44.198 --> 11:47.233
The tiniest story gets dissected
over and over again.

11:47.301 --> 11:51.037
In 2004, a kid from pawnee
went to the olympics,

11:51.104 --> 11:54.273
And it was reported on
for over a year.

11:54.341 --> 11:56.042
He wasn't even competing
or anything.

11:56.109 --> 11:59.312
He just was going, literally,
to watch the olympics.

12:06.353 --> 12:08.688
- It was way too easy
to get this guy here.

12:08.755 --> 12:11.624
- Councilman dexhart,
this has gone far enough.

12:11.692 --> 12:13.159
I want you to hold
a press conference

12:13.227 --> 12:14.160
And clear my name.

12:14.228 --> 12:16.696
- Mmm, no, thanks.
- Why not?

12:16.763 --> 12:17.897
What's in it for you?

12:17.965 --> 12:19.599
- Well, to be honest,
being linked to leslie

12:19.666 --> 12:21.267
Is a lot less damning
than the real story.

12:21.335 --> 12:24.370
You're like a glass
of whole milk.

12:24.438 --> 12:27.006
What are you, lutheran?
I love lutherans.

12:27.074 --> 12:29.475
- Councilman, with all due
respect, get a grip.

12:29.543 --> 12:30.843
If you don't hold
a press conference,

12:30.911 --> 12:32.912
I'm gonna come forward
and tell the whole story.

12:32.980 --> 12:34.280
It won't do you any good.

12:34.348 --> 12:37.416
Take it from me, denying
only makes things worse.

12:37.484 --> 12:38.784
Listen, I gotta go.

12:38.852 --> 12:40.820
I'm expected at two different
maternity wards.

12:40.888 --> 12:44.690
But before I go,
I'd be remiss if I didn't ask--

12:44.758 --> 12:46.525
Should we?

12:46.593 --> 12:48.427
Oh, my god!

12:48.495 --> 12:49.428
- People already think
we did it.

12:49.496 --> 12:50.496
You've got nothing to lose.

12:50.564 --> 12:52.331
I'm very good.
- Get outta here!

12:52.399 --> 12:53.332
All right, fine.

12:53.400 --> 12:56.002
- Shoe shine.
Shoe shine.

12:56.069 --> 12:57.737
Oh, hey.
- Hey.

12:57.804 --> 12:59.505
- I've been thinking about
your gay boyfriend all day.

12:59.573 --> 13:01.240
I have got
some awesome ideas.

13:01.308 --> 13:01.994
Okay.

13:01.432 --> 13:05.634
First idea:
Spray tan gift certificates.

13:06.202 --> 13:09.338
Uh...No.

13:09.405 --> 13:12.007
- Trip to germany.
Germany is awesome.

13:12.075 --> 13:13.742
And expensive.

13:13.810 --> 13:16.311
- Good call.
I didn't think of that.

13:16.379 --> 13:17.773
- Okay, you know how
people say

13:17.841 --> 13:20.009
That you should give gifts that
you would want to get yourself?

13:20.377 --> 13:21.777
What would you want?

13:21.845 --> 13:24.113
- Easy. Indianapolis colts
reggie wayne jersey--

13:24.180 --> 13:26.015
Number 87, double-xl,
home blue,

13:26.082 --> 13:28.017
Signed by reggie wayne right
after he catches a touchdown

13:28.084 --> 13:29.551
To win the super bowl.

13:29.619 --> 13:33.222
- Okay, never mind.
- No?

13:33.289 --> 13:35.991
<i>Hip-hop abs dance
fitness dvd.</i>

13:36.059 --> 13:39.628
- We just received
these exclusive photos.

13:39.696 --> 13:41.296
We have pictures
of city councilman dexhart...

13:41.364 --> 13:44.566
- Oh, my god!
I cannot believe it!

13:44.634 --> 13:48.003
- The big issue now is
who is this mystery woman?

13:48.071 --> 13:51.440
She and knope are standing
very close to each other.

13:51.508 --> 13:53.275
And anytime you see
two women

13:53.343 --> 13:55.277
Standing very close
to each other,

13:55.345 --> 13:56.545
You immediately assume...
- No, no, don't say it.

13:56.613 --> 13:58.313
Please don't say it.
- Lesbian.

13:58.381 --> 13:59.948
- Oh, of course.
- What?

14:00.016 --> 14:03.385
- It is a veritable storm
of information

14:03.453 --> 14:05.254
Coming in to the studios
here today.

14:05.321 --> 14:07.322
- Hi, this is leslie knope,
and I would like joan

14:07.390 --> 14:08.457
To clear all of her guests
tomorrow

14:08.525 --> 14:09.825
Because I'm coming on the show.

14:09.893 --> 14:11.793
If you think that you can drag
me and my friend

14:11.861 --> 14:13.495
Through the mud,
then you've got--

14:13.563 --> 14:14.663
Yes, I'll hold.

14:16.199 --> 14:17.199
- It's unbelievable.
- Hey.

14:17.267 --> 14:18.801
What happened?

14:18.869 --> 14:20.603
- Got a call from some panicky
morning joggers.

14:21.070 --> 14:23.705
Apparently sanitation didn't
empty this dumpster,

14:23.773 --> 14:25.908
To the raccoons' delight.

14:25.975 --> 14:28.043
- I thought raccoons were
supposed to be nocturnal.

14:28.111 --> 14:29.344
- Not in this town,
sweetheart.

14:29.412 --> 14:31.413
In this town,
they're 24/7.

14:31.481 --> 14:34.049
We can't have raccoons
for the christmas thing.

14:34.117 --> 14:36.718
They'll hunt the kids
for sport.

14:36.786 --> 14:38.387
Fess up, guys.
Who dropped the ball?

14:38.454 --> 14:41.423
- Bring a case of beer
to sanitation.

14:41.491 --> 14:43.091
Bring a case of--

14:43.159 --> 14:44.626
Yeah, this one's
our fault, ron.

14:44.694 --> 14:46.361
And we will take care
of this for you.

14:46.429 --> 14:49.398
- Okay good, because I
have to run a public forum,

14:49.465 --> 14:51.099
Supervise the maintenance crews,

14:51.167 --> 14:53.969
And teach crafts
at the senior center.

14:54.037 --> 14:55.537
Simuaneously.

14:55.605 --> 14:57.706
- Joan, I just wanted
to say thank you

14:57.774 --> 14:59.741
For letting me be
on your show.

14:59.809 --> 15:01.910
I'm really happy that I have
the chance to clear my name.

15:01.978 --> 15:04.146
- Sure. I see you brought
your girlfriend for support.

15:04.214 --> 15:06.915
That's nice.
- What?

15:06.983 --> 15:08.850
Oh, no, she's not--
- and in five, joan...

15:08.918 --> 15:09.985
- She's a--we're--
- four, three...

15:10.053 --> 15:11.420
You've got it wrong.

15:11.487 --> 15:16.147
- Sex. Drugs, possibly.
Rock and roll?

15:16.215 --> 15:18.449
<i>We'll find out
on pawnee today's</i>

15:18.517 --> 15:20.752
Exclusive interview
with the woman

15:20.819 --> 15:24.355
At the center of the dexhart
sex scandal, leslie knope.

15:24.423 --> 15:28.159
Leslie, my first question
has to be

15:28.227 --> 15:30.161
When did the affair start?

15:30.229 --> 15:32.664
- Joan, I spoke with
councilman dexhart

15:32.731 --> 15:34.132
For the first time
that night.

15:34.199 --> 15:36.668
We met for about
15 minutes,

15:36.735 --> 15:39.671
And then I went home alone,
and that's the whole story.

15:39.738 --> 15:41.439
- Well, leslie,
we all saw the tape

15:41.507 --> 15:43.107
From four years ago,

15:43.175 --> 15:46.044
And you were flashing
some serious "do me" eyes.

15:46.111 --> 15:47.278
That's just my opinion.

15:47.346 --> 15:49.714
- I don't understand why
I'm on trial here.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.417
You should be grilling
councilman dexhart.

15:52.484 --> 15:55.086
- Oh, you know what,
that's a really good idea.

15:55.154 --> 15:57.789
Uh, let's bring him out.
Councilman, come on out.

15:57.856 --> 15:59.691
Hi, sweetie.

15:59.758 --> 16:02.627
- Why didn't you tell me
he was gonna be here?

16:02.695 --> 16:04.462
- I thought it'd be
more exciting.

16:04.530 --> 16:06.230
You look great.

16:09.134 --> 16:10.935
It's like I'm invisible.

16:11.003 --> 16:12.637
Okay, my name is ron.

16:12.705 --> 16:15.073
You don't need to know
my last name.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.541
Whoever wants to talk,
go ahead,

16:16.609 --> 16:18.910
And we'll be out of here
in a tight 15.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.245
- I found a sandwich
in one of your parks,

16:21.313 --> 16:26.084
And I want to know why
it didn't have mayonnaise.

16:26.151 --> 16:27.752
What's so funny?
- Oh.

16:27.820 --> 16:28.987
- Yeah, I don't think kids
should be allowed

16:29.054 --> 16:30.321
On the playground equipment.

16:30.389 --> 16:31.812
Okay, we've been over this.

16:32.580 --> 16:33.347
If you're worried about
swine flu,

16:34.215 --> 16:35.882
Use hand sanitizer--

16:35.950 --> 16:36.950
- I'm not worried about
swine flu.

16:37.017 --> 16:38.084
I already had the swine flu.

16:38.152 --> 16:39.152
I'm worried about
the turtle flu!

16:39.220 --> 16:41.487
- The turtle flu...
- Turtle flu.

16:41.555 --> 16:44.090
Turtle flu.

16:44.158 --> 16:46.960
<i>- Joan, this whole
pawnee sun story</i>

16:47.027 --> 16:49.095
Is "gotcha journalism"
at its worst.

16:49.163 --> 16:51.164
Honey, let's just keep
our private life

16:51.232 --> 16:52.498
In the bedroom
where it belongs.

16:52.566 --> 16:54.534
- We do not have
a private life.

16:54.602 --> 16:56.436
Stop saying that we have
a private life.

16:56.503 --> 16:57.904
The fact is we never
slept together.

16:57.972 --> 17:00.373
And if we did,
you would have proof.

17:00.441 --> 17:02.141
And we would have seen it
by now.

17:02.209 --> 17:03.409
Councilman?

17:03.477 --> 17:05.744
I can prove it.

17:05.813 --> 17:08.982
She has a mole
on her right buttock.

17:09.049 --> 17:11.751
- What?
That is a total lie.

17:11.819 --> 17:14.253
You've never seen my butt.
What are you talking about?

17:14.320 --> 17:16.489
He has never seen my butt.

17:16.557 --> 17:17.991
-

17:18.058 --> 17:20.960
- Well, I guess it's your word
against his.

17:21.028 --> 17:22.428
I mean...
- That's right.

17:23.497 --> 17:25.265
Fine.

17:25.332 --> 17:28.134
Here, joan, why don't you look
for yourself?

17:28.202 --> 17:30.536
Is this happening?

17:30.604 --> 17:32.939
Wait...There's no mole.

17:33.007 --> 17:34.774
There is no mole!

17:34.842 --> 17:36.843
This exclusive story--

17:36.911 --> 17:39.679
There is no mole
on miss knope!

17:39.747 --> 17:40.680
- I can't believe
it's come to this.

17:40.748 --> 17:41.981
This is utterly humiliating.

17:42.049 --> 17:43.449
- Well, councilman,
care to make a comment

17:43.517 --> 17:45.718
About no-mole-gate?

17:45.786 --> 17:47.253
Yes.

17:47.321 --> 17:48.888
I really didn't think
that miss knope would

17:48.956 --> 17:50.379
Pull down her pants on tv.

17:51.047 --> 17:53.282
But since she did,

17:53.349 --> 17:56.785
I will admit that the rumors
of our affair

17:56.853 --> 17:58.921
Are indeed false.

17:58.988 --> 18:00.322
- Thank you.
- However...

18:00.390 --> 18:02.357
I have no plans to resign.

18:02.425 --> 18:04.259
- Oh, great.
Okay, councilman,

18:04.327 --> 18:05.427
You know what,
you're a class act.

18:05.495 --> 18:06.862
Thank you.

18:06.930 --> 18:08.697
I thought you did great.

18:08.765 --> 18:09.998
When you get all feisty
like that,

18:10.066 --> 18:12.301
It gets my heart racing.

18:12.368 --> 18:14.536
Like I'm on a stairmaster.

18:14.604 --> 18:20.876
Except more like
in a sexual...Context.

18:20.944 --> 18:24.746
- I can't go to san diego
with you.

18:28.051 --> 18:31.653
My life is here.
My friends, my career.

18:31.721 --> 18:33.589
- I guess I just thought,
with everything that happened,

18:33.656 --> 18:35.991
You'd want a fresh start.

18:36.059 --> 18:39.361
- I know, I--
I really care about you, dave.

18:39.429 --> 18:40.863
I just--

18:40.930 --> 18:43.732
I love this town.

18:43.800 --> 18:45.334
I'm sorry.

18:47.136 --> 18:48.570
You want your ticket back?

18:48.638 --> 18:51.240
- No. You know what,
keep it.

18:51.307 --> 18:54.943
You may want to
come visit me, right?

18:55.011 --> 18:57.112
There's a $75 change fee,

18:57.180 --> 18:59.615
But I could pay you that,
or I could reimburse you.

18:59.682 --> 19:01.316
There's a lot of ways
we could handle that.

19:11.983 --> 19:14.986
Oh, ho, that's, uh...

19:15.954 --> 19:18.722
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

19:18.790 --> 19:19.823
Hey!

19:19.891 --> 19:22.426
- Oh, honey,
I'm so proud of you.

19:22.493 --> 19:25.563
That took guts,
mooning joan callamezzo.

19:25.581 --> 19:27.548
Aww, honey...
- Thanks, mom.

19:27.616 --> 19:29.651
Oh, my god, is something wrong
with the tree?

19:29.718 --> 19:31.352
No, nothing wrong.

19:31.420 --> 19:32.353
- But it's almost 9:00.
It should have been lighted up

19:32.421 --> 19:33.454
An hour ago.

19:33.522 --> 19:34.989
We waited for you.

19:40.863 --> 19:43.131
Okay, everybody,
countin' down!

19:43.198 --> 19:47.468
-
five, four, three, two,

19:47.536 --> 19:48.770
One.

19:52.574 --> 19:55.810
- Ã¢ÂTÂª joy to the world
the lord is come Ã¢ÂTÂª

19:55.878 --> 19:59.781
Ã¢ÂTÂª let earth receive
her king Ã¢ÂTÂª

19:59.848 --> 20:02.617
Ã¢ÂTÂª let every heart... Ã¢ÂTÂª

20:02.685 --> 20:05.153
- It's gotten a lot harder
to work in government.

20:05.220 --> 20:07.388
You think winston churchill
ever had to pull his pants down

20:07.456 --> 20:08.456
And show his butt?

20:08.524 --> 20:10.925
No.
But would he have?

20:10.993 --> 20:12.293
Yes.

20:12.361 --> 20:13.962
Now, could he have?

20:14.029 --> 20:15.363
Maybe not towards
the end of his life,

20:15.431 --> 20:18.533
But he would have.

20:18.600 --> 20:20.135
Because he loved his job.

20:30.979 --> 20:36.016
- Ho ho!
Reggie wayne!

20:36.084 --> 20:37.818
Dude!

20:37.886 --> 20:40.954
You remembered me complaining
about my computer bag.

20:41.022 --> 20:43.657
- Do you like it?
- Yeah, it's perfect.

20:43.725 --> 20:45.826
It's way better than the gift
that I got you.

20:45.894 --> 19:47.917
It's pacers tickets.

20:48.085 --> 20:49.853
- Oh...
- They're not even good seats.

20:49.920 --> 20:51.387
Achh!
- This is awesome.

20:51.455 --> 20:52.455
It's not awesome.

20:52.523 --> 20:56.593
- I actually got you
a second gift.

20:56.660 --> 20:58.762
You don't have to come
to this game with me.

21:00.264 --> 21:02.766
You don't have to.

21:02.833 --> 21:03.933
- That's the nicest gift...
- Is that good? Is that good?

21:04.001 --> 21:05.835
- Anybody's ever gotten me
in my life.

21:07.705 --> 21:09.272
Oh, thank god.

21:09.340 --> 21:11.207
There's a bunch of messages
waiting for you

21:11.275 --> 21:14.644
About a bunch of things
I don't understand.
