baksheesh (bribe)

54:59.383 --> 55:00.736
More water, Omar.

55:04.223 --> 55:05.372
Fine.

55:05.703 --> 55:08.581
This well has plenty of water.

55:09.263 --> 55:11.538
We can fill her bath all the way.

01:06:50.731 --> 01:06:52.020
souq  (marketplace)

01:22:56.486 --> 01:23:03.408
I see a bright future. Greatness.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.794
With abundant wealth.

01:23:08.286 --> 01:23:11.070
A great destiny will take shape.

01:23:11.296 --> 01:23:14.734
No. I will forge my own destiny.

01:23:46.839 --> 01:23:50.733
Hey boss, we might need four saddles.
How much apiece?

01:23:50.735 --> 01:23:53.976
The Noble Lady needn't pay.
Our gift.

01:23:54.663 --> 01:23:55.739
Why?

01:23:56.506 --> 01:24:00.422
The Lady is a guest of our sheik.
Guests don't pay. Welcome.

01:24:00.568 --> 01:24:01.777
We thank the sheikh.

01:24:01.876 --> 01:24:04.099
Four of these.
I'll have them ready.

01:24:04.101 --> 01:24:08.817
Thank you very much.

01:32:19.206 --> 01:32:22.950
Deliver this please.

01:32:29.891 --> 01:32:31.653
It's not enough.

01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:36.228
This is a desert,
not a post office.

01:32:36.686 --> 01:32:39.655
I only have this donkey
for transportation.

01:32:50.637 --> 01:32:53.335
Is this enough?

01:32:59.885 --> 01:33:02.690
Thank you.

01:34:42.307 --> 01:34:43.638
My lady.

01:34:43.863 --> 01:34:46.696
Our sheik wishes to invite you to
have tea with him in his tent.

01:34:47.863 --> 01:34:50.457
Does the lady
accept the invitation?

01:34:52.223 --> 01:34:54.680
Yes, the honor is mine.

01:34:55.143 --> 01:34:57.418
The honor is mine.

01:35:21.658 --> 01:35:26.074
The Sheik of the Harb invites
the Lady of the Desert to his tent.

01:35:26.984 --> 01:35:28.688
Of course.

01:35:28.968 --> 01:35:30.642
Thank you.

01:35:42.926 --> 01:35:47.701
According to our tradition, I am honored to
invite you for a dinner feast.

01:35:48.283 --> 01:35:51.877
It is an honor
to accept your hospitality.

01:35:52.241 --> 01:35:54.756
Anyone who makes it to my tent is a guest.

01:35:54.758 --> 01:35:57.587
Your Arabic pronunciation
is excellent.

01:36:15.318 --> 01:36:16.518
Thank you.

01:36:22.337 --> 01:36:24.497
Ah! Thank you.

01:39:40.417 --> 01:39:43.295
The sand is soft,
we will camp here.

01:39:43.778 --> 01:39:45.632
What do we do next?

01:39:46.058 --> 01:39:47.684
Wait and see.

01:39:47.978 --> 01:39:52.079
When they come out,
they come out to welcome us...

01:39:52.178 --> 01:39:54.923
Or they come out to kill us.

01:39:56.738 --> 01:39:58.498
I don't see anyone.

01:39:58.504 --> 01:40:02.942
They are arguing about
what to do with us.

01:41:28.007 --> 01:41:31.477
I am Ibrahim,
uncle of our beloved emir.

01:41:34.983 --> 01:41:36.539
May I see him?

01:41:38.187 --> 01:41:39.633
He is gone.

01:41:41.158 --> 01:41:42.634
When will he be back?

01:41:43.246 --> 01:41:47.930
He is at war with our enemies.
You cannot leave until he returns.

01:41:54.998 --> 01:41:56.741
And my men?

01:42:07.686 --> 01:42:09.749
You will stay here.
