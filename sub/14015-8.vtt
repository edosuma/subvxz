NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system

00:02.903 --> 00:06.783
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

00:06.840 --> 00:08.650
the police
who investigate crime

00:08.709 --> 00:11.519
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

00:11.578 --> 00:13.388
These are their stories.

00:19.286 --> 00:21.456
How old's the little guy?
Two.

00:21.522 --> 00:24.902
She tried to get him to blow out the candles.
You should have seen that.

00:24.958 --> 00:26.668
Managed to open
his own presents, though.

00:26.727 --> 00:27.727
What'd you get him?

00:27.794 --> 00:30.934
A doghouse, so he'd stop
sleeping in the bed with us.

00:30.998 --> 00:32.567
No such luck.

00:33.267 --> 00:36.707

It's bad.

01:01.461 --> 01:05.200
2-7 Charlie to Central.
Better put a rush on that bus.

01:07.568 --> 01:11.518
This better be good, Crockit. I was on my way home.
I don't feel so good.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.282
Hey, don't look at me.

01:13.340 --> 01:15.950
AIS guy says there's something
fishy, call the suits.

01:16.009 --> 01:17.609
I do what I'm told.
What happened?

01:17.678 --> 01:20.318
Judging from the skid marks,
this guy's going the wrong way,

01:20.380 --> 01:23.520
swerves into the other car, and wham.
The other guy never had a chance.

do accident investigations.

Here's your murder weapon. Rest
in peace, you sorry bastard.

01:35.028 --> 01:38.068
What the hell happened? Didn't you hear?
We got demoted.

RANDALL: Briscoe, Logan.
Over here.

01:40.767 --> 01:43.907
Randall, this is a traffic accident.
I'm going to bed.

01:43.971 --> 01:47.281
Just take a look at this, would you?
I'm getting ready to write it up.

01:47.341 --> 01:49.621
Looks like a standard 54
with a DOA,

01:49.676 --> 01:53.206
and then I noticed most of her wounds
are on the right side of her body.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.890
Except she's
in the driver's seat.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.229
Yeah. Well,
she's about 5'4 ", 5'2",

01:58.285 --> 02:01.525
but the seat's all the way back and
her feet can't even touch the pedals.

02:01.588 --> 02:03.928
So maybe the seat
got jarred in the crash.

02:03.991 --> 02:06.161
No. It would've
gotten jarred forward.

02:06.226 --> 02:08.466
I don't think she was driving.

02:09.363 --> 02:11.343
So what are you saying?
Somebody moved her?

02:11.398 --> 02:13.108
Then fled the scene.

02:13.166 --> 02:15.646
Not one law-abiding citizen
saw any of this?

02:15.702 --> 02:18.952
A woman down the block says she
heard the crash about 1:45.

02:19.006 --> 02:22.316
That's verified by some people
coming out of Club Mania.

02:22.376 --> 02:24.856

actually saw anything.

03:18.598 --> 03:19.838
I'd say
he's got something to hide.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.440
You ever think maybe he
went for medical treatment?

03:22.502 --> 03:26.752
Well, then either he never got there or
he didn't go to any ER in this city.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.647
So what do we have,
leaving the scene?

03:28.708 --> 03:31.808
AIS says it was
the drunk guy's fault.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.218
No reason to leave the scene.

03:33.280 --> 03:36.450

He moved the girl's body.

anyone to know he was there.

Lyssa Wesley. 497 West 83rd.

It was her car.
Looks like she lives alone.

03:47.461 --> 03:50.841
Well, odds are our mystery man has a
wife and a couple of kids at home

at his office working late.

before she died, it's us.

See this horizontal laceration
on her forehead?

04:04.945 --> 04:07.385
Looks like she hit the dash.
Died instantly.

04:07.447 --> 04:09.317
Thank you for small favors.

04:09.382 --> 04:13.992
Yeah, but somebody did her a big one before she died.
Look at these bruises.

04:17.057 --> 04:19.437
Well,
you should've seen the car.

04:19.493 --> 04:23.243
These were on her legs and arms which
are not consistent with the crash.

04:23.296 --> 04:27.566
Abrasions on her buttocks and more
bruises resembling finger marks.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.512
Looks like her underwear
was ripped off.

04:30.570 --> 04:32.710
And there's vaginal tearing.
Semen.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.623
So we're talking rape.

04:35.242 --> 04:39.162
If it was a romantic evening at home,
I'd hate to meet her boyfriend.

04:44.184 --> 04:47.794
Her head hit the dash here at
this dent, point of impact.

04:47.854 --> 04:50.434
Whoever moved her was 6',
maybe 6'1",

04:50.490 --> 04:52.470
judging from the seat
and the rearview mirrors.

04:52.526 --> 04:53.726
You get any lifts?
Yeah.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.504
A few off the steering wheel and
gear shift that aren't hers.

04:56.563 --> 04:58.843
Sent them to latent. The
guy doesn't have a record.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.939
He went all out
for his first offense.

05:01.001 --> 05:03.411
Anything else inside the car?
Yeah. Right over here.

05:03.470 --> 05:06.040

from My Fair Lady,

05:06.106 --> 05:08.306
an eyebrow pencil,
some loose change...

it down in between the seat.

Hotel Intercontinental.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.622
Oh, yeah, I remember her. She
left right before my shift ended.

05:18.685 --> 05:21.495
Around 1:30, 1:45.

05:21.555 --> 05:24.825
She leave alone?
No. She was with some guy.

05:24.891 --> 05:26.801
And they weren't having
the best time, either.

05:26.860 --> 05:29.500
You mean they were fighting?
I didn't see them.

05:29.563 --> 05:31.273
But she was crying

05:31.331 --> 05:33.401
and it seemed like he was in a big
hurry to get her out of here.

05:33.466 --> 05:35.036
Could you describe him?

05:36.136 --> 05:39.516
Six feet, maybe. Dark hair.
Wearing a tuxedo.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.253
Would he stand out in a crowd?

05:41.308 --> 05:43.848
Not really. The place was
crawling with tuxedos last night.

05:43.910 --> 05:46.080

I just can't believe she's dead.
I just saw her last night.

06:05.732 --> 06:08.142
That would be at the
fundraiser, right? Yeah.

06:08.201 --> 06:11.111
Mr. Talbert invited the whole
staff, including the peons.

06:11.171 --> 06:12.981
We even got to meet the mayor.

06:13.039 --> 06:17.249
Was Lyssa there with a date?
No. Her fiancÃ© had to work.

What time did she leave?

06:20.013 --> 06:21.863
I don't know.

06:22.182 --> 06:26.762
9:00 maybe. I was supposed to get a
ride home with her after the party.

06:26.820 --> 06:30.630
She went to make a call to her
fiancÃ© and never came back.

06:30.924 --> 06:35.774
The valet said she left with a tall
man, dark hair, wearing a tux.

06:36.096 --> 06:39.436
Well, that could be anybody. Half
the guys here were wearing tuxes.

06:39.499 --> 06:43.279
Any of the guys talk to Lyssa?
You know, flirt with her?

06:43.336 --> 06:45.676
Lots of guys flirt with Lyssa.

06:49.175 --> 06:51.345
I don't remember. I'm sorry.

06:52.979 --> 06:56.119
She leaves the party
around 9:00, vanishes,

06:56.182 --> 06:59.392
and then turns up dead
in a car accident around 1:45.

06:59.452 --> 07:02.992
Yeah. And in between she gets raped
by some gentleman in a tuxedo

07:03.056 --> 07:05.826
who's kind enough
to give her a ride home later.

07:05.892 --> 07:10.072
We sent a sketch artist over to the
parking guy, so maybe we'll get lucky.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.340
Call the Times.

07:11.398 --> 07:14.398
See if they sent a photographer
over to cover the party.

with Councilman Talbert.

07:26.112 --> 07:29.562
You see the guy or what?
No. No, not yet.

07:29.616 --> 07:31.646
Here's Lyssa at her table.

07:33.987 --> 07:35.757
Any of these guys
look familiar?

07:35.822 --> 07:37.672
It's hard to say,
you know, these...

07:38.692 --> 07:41.902
No... There he is.
Which one?

07:41.962 --> 07:44.572
The one smoking a cigarette.
That's the guy.

07:44.631 --> 07:47.011
Third from the right.
Todd Locke.

07:48.201 --> 07:51.581
Look, you have to understand. I am
Councilman Talbert's chief aide.

07:51.638 --> 07:54.278
A scandal like this hits the paper and I...
What scandal?

07:54.341 --> 07:56.981
Thought you said you just
gave the lady a ride home.

07:57.043 --> 08:00.153
I did. But how was I supposed to know
a drunk was gonna swerve into us?

08:00.213 --> 08:03.253
It was an accident.
So why'd you move her body?

08:03.316 --> 08:06.386
I panicked.
It was a stupid thing to do.

08:07.387 --> 08:08.487
So what am I charged with?

08:08.555 --> 08:11.155
Leaving the scene of an accident,
tampering with evidence...

08:11.224 --> 08:13.764
We're just getting started.
This is...

08:13.827 --> 08:16.167
I told you. She had a
little too much to drink...

08:16.229 --> 08:18.869
No. No. No. No. Not according
to our medical examiner.

08:18.932 --> 08:22.142
She looked drunk, okay?
So I offered to drive her.

08:23.770 --> 08:27.080
Was that before
or after you raped her?

08:27.841 --> 08:31.051
What? Whoa, whoa, guys. You got this all wrong.
I never touched her.

08:31.111 --> 08:34.491
What were you two doing between
9:30 and 1:45? Taking a poll?

08:34.581 --> 08:37.961
I don't know what she was doing.
I wasn't with her.

08:38.018 --> 08:41.857
So after the party you just
hung around for five hours?

08:41.921 --> 08:44.201
And then you just happened
to run into her?

08:44.256 --> 08:46.597
That's stretching it
pretty thin, bud!

08:46.659 --> 08:49.159
I had a drink in the bar.
Bar closed at 12:00.

08:49.229 --> 08:51.839
I was in the lobby after that. Well,
then we'll find some witnesses.

08:51.898 --> 08:52.898
Give me your cuffs, Lennie.

08:52.966 --> 08:55.496
In the meantime, you're under arrest
for the rape of Lyssa Wesley.

08:55.568 --> 08:57.448
And for leaving the scene of an accident.
Okay, okay. No. Please. Listen.

08:57.504 --> 08:59.984
I didn't rape anybody!
I swear.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.380
But you know who did,
don't you?

09:03.743 --> 09:06.093
LOGAN: Mr. Locke, sit down.

09:10.150 --> 09:13.500
Now, I think you know
you're in very deep here,

09:14.621 --> 09:17.691
so why don't you tell us
who you're protecting?

09:19.893 --> 09:24.473
Look, she told me in the car
before the crash.

09:24.531 --> 09:26.671
She said she had been raped.

09:29.502 --> 09:31.412
She said it was
Councilman Talbert.

09:38.978 --> 09:42.518
Spencer Talbert's an elected city official.
He's running for Congress.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.032
So what? He broke the law
and we want him.

09:45.085 --> 09:48.395
We can't just barge into his office and
publicly accuse him of rape. Not yet.

09:48.455 --> 09:51.125
He stood with us, Mike.
City budget went to the bone.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.101
Talbert came through
for this department.

09:53.159 --> 09:54.999
I'm not saying
we don't investigate.

09:55.061 --> 09:57.511
But we do have to consider
Talbert's public reputation.

09:57.564 --> 10:01.314
I hate to say this, but I hope it's not true.
He's the good guy.

10:01.367 --> 10:04.277
His get-tough-on-crime
platform won him the election.

10:04.337 --> 10:05.937
Sounds more like
we're trying to protect him

10:06.005 --> 10:07.745
from getting his picture
on the front page.

10:07.807 --> 10:11.017
I just think we can make a better case
if we kept it off for a few days.

10:11.077 --> 10:13.247
Okay. Well, how do you
propose we do that?

10:13.313 --> 10:15.293
Because the minute we start
asking him questions...

10:15.348 --> 10:19.088
If Todd Locke cooperates, there
may not be too many to ask.

10:19.919 --> 10:24.059
It's a gift, Todd.
Listen to the DA.

10:25.859 --> 10:29.769
I shouldn't have told you anything as it is.
Loyalty, you know.

10:29.829 --> 10:33.299
Cooperate and the charge is
leaving the scene of an accident.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.366
Six months probation.

10:35.435 --> 10:40.505
Don't, we add tampering with evidence,
accessory to rape, conspiracy.

10:40.573 --> 10:44.583
All felonies. No pleas. Feed
the homeless, clean a park.

10:46.279 --> 10:48.729
You don't need
Talbert's problems.

10:57.190 --> 11:00.760
We're at the fundraiser
and Talbert spots Lyssa.

11:01.795 --> 11:05.795
He's interested but his wife's there.
So I have to tell Lyssa.

11:06.866 --> 11:08.936
Talbert wants to speak to her
later in his suite.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.852
He heard what a good job
she's doing on the campaign.

11:13.273 --> 11:16.253
So I brought her up.
He told me to wait in the bar.

11:16.309 --> 11:18.409
How'd you wind up with her?

11:18.478 --> 11:21.788
Talbert went home in the limo and he
told me to make sure she got home.

11:21.848 --> 11:23.348
She had a car.

11:24.784 --> 11:27.134
No, there was no way
she could drive.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.167
When she came down
she looked like hell.

11:29.222 --> 11:32.932
You know, make-up was running,
eyes were red.

11:33.226 --> 11:34.526
Real bad shape.

11:36.829 --> 11:38.829
I kind of had a feeling
what happened.

11:38.898 --> 11:41.808
Are you assuming she was
raped, or did she tell you?

11:41.868 --> 11:44.248
Eventually she told me.

11:44.304 --> 11:48.054
She asked me
to take her to a hospital.

11:48.641 --> 11:51.051
That's where
we were going when...

11:56.149 --> 11:57.919
She was a nice girl.

12:02.855 --> 12:03.925
Wait. Let me
get this straight.

12:03.990 --> 12:06.870
Todd told you that Lyssa
told him that I raped her?

12:06.926 --> 12:08.836
That's the charge.

12:08.895 --> 12:13.365
She was in your suite. Your
aide was driving her home.

12:14.701 --> 12:17.771
If you wanna take a cup into the
men's room and clear yourself.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.452
All right, detectives. I...

12:30.283 --> 12:33.963
I was with Lyssa. But
understand, I'm a married man.

12:34.020 --> 12:37.060
I hold public office. Incidents
like this can be damaging.

12:37.123 --> 12:41.043
No disrespect to the office, but
this is more than an incident.

12:41.995 --> 12:45.765
It's a load of crap. LOGAN: That's
not what the medical examiner said.

12:45.832 --> 12:48.472
Lyssa was roughed up.
Torn panties.

12:48.534 --> 12:50.954
Heat of passion.
Heavy bruising.

12:51.004 --> 12:54.984
She died in a car wreck. The
bruises were between her legs.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.160
Believe who and what you like,
detectives.

12:59.212 --> 13:03.562
But I'm afraid Lyssa's unfortunate
death brings this matter to a close.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.204
So what did you expect?
Of course he's gonna deny it.

13:07.253 --> 13:10.793
We have Locke's sworn statement
and the ME's report.

13:10.857 --> 13:13.097
The statement's hearsay,
probably inadmissible.

13:13.159 --> 13:14.829
The ME's report's
not definitive.

13:14.894 --> 13:18.034
What can I tell you guys? McCoy
wants more before he goes to court.

13:18.097 --> 13:19.467
What do you think?

13:20.767 --> 13:23.477
My personal feelings
are irrelevant.

13:24.170 --> 13:26.410
CLAIRE: A rape trial
boils down to lack of consent.

13:26.472 --> 13:30.982
Yeah. So this piece of cheese gets to walk
because the victim happened to get killed

13:31.044 --> 13:33.924
in a head-on with a drunk.
I'm not saying we drop this.

13:33.980 --> 13:35.190
No?

13:35.548 --> 13:38.888
What do we do, get Madam
Losanda to throw a sÃ©ance?

13:41.287 --> 13:45.457
I'm thinking maybe this wasn't the
first woman he got friendly with.

13:45.725 --> 13:47.665
If we can establish a pattern,

13:47.727 --> 13:51.397
it's possible to prove Lyssa's lack
of consent without her testimony.

13:52.498 --> 13:55.138
Well, she did work
for Talbert, right?

13:56.035 --> 13:57.945
Maybe there are
some other employees

13:58.004 --> 14:00.544
who performed above
and beyond the call of duty.

14:02.942 --> 14:07.052
As soon as I heard the rumors about Lyssa
and Mr. Talbert, I said I am out of here.

14:07.113 --> 14:08.683
Did you ever hear
any other rumors?

14:08.748 --> 14:11.848
I just answer the phone. I'm not
exactly high up on the totem pole.

14:11.918 --> 14:15.158
So he never came on to anybody else? You
know, made a few suggestive remarks?

14:15.221 --> 14:18.071
He let his hand linger
on my arm a few times.

14:18.124 --> 14:20.074
Just enough
to make me uncomfortable.

14:20.126 --> 14:23.466
BRISCOE: You the only one he touched?
Nobody's ever complained.

14:23.529 --> 14:26.869
But people around here
practically worship the guy.

14:26.933 --> 14:29.643
You'd think Lyssa Wesley's
death would change all that.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.882
Around here, I don't think so.

14:31.938 --> 14:34.148
At home
it may be a different story.

14:34.207 --> 14:37.877
When Mrs. Talbert left this
morning she didn't look happy.

14:38.077 --> 14:41.457
I can't believe you're actually
dignifying this nonsense, detectives.

14:41.514 --> 14:44.834
Mrs. Talbert, I think it would
be better if we spoke privately.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.024
Of course. Molly, honey,

14:46.085 --> 14:49.115
why don't you go find Flannery
and see if lunch is ready, okay?

14:51.224 --> 14:54.334
I don't really know what
you expect me to tell you.

14:54.394 --> 14:57.604
Spencer and I have been
together for 13 years now.

14:57.663 --> 14:59.613
We have a very strong marriage.

15:00.399 --> 15:02.539
Strong enough to withstand
a rape accusation?

15:02.602 --> 15:04.912
I'm sure I don't have to
explain to you

15:04.971 --> 15:08.151
the difference between rape
and false accusation.

15:09.409 --> 15:13.919
With all due respect, Mrs. Talbert,
this girl was pretty badly beaten up.

15:13.980 --> 15:15.460
And she said
your husband did it.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.515
And if she hadn't been killed
in that car accident,

15:17.583 --> 15:20.433
she'd probably be
next month's centerfold.

15:21.154 --> 15:25.034
Spencer is not the first public figure
to be attacked with vicious lies.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.091
You seem pretty sure
about that.

15:27.160 --> 15:30.770
My husband told me about his
indiscretion with this girl.

15:31.597 --> 15:35.597
It hasn't been easy, but we're
working through it. We'll survive.

15:35.668 --> 15:38.708
You learn how to do that
during 13 years of marriage?

15:40.039 --> 15:42.709
If you're asking me if there
have been others, Detective,

15:42.775 --> 15:44.905
I can honestly tell you no.

15:45.511 --> 15:47.681
The worst thing he ever
did was get touchy-feely

15:47.747 --> 15:49.187
with one of his
campaign workers.

15:49.248 --> 15:51.788
Yeah. And the wife
sang Stand By Your Man.

15:51.851 --> 15:53.021
Not much of a pattern.

15:53.119 --> 15:55.529
Well, he's a politician. He
knows how to cover his tracks.

15:55.588 --> 16:00.058
So maybe we should find out what he
did before he had to be so discreet.

16:04.730 --> 16:07.010
Spencer was head of the
department for ten years.

16:07.066 --> 16:09.806
After he was bitten by the
political bug, I took over.

16:09.869 --> 16:13.109
Must be tough giving up all
this for a councilman's salary.

16:13.172 --> 16:16.592
I don't think Spencer's sights
stop at a congressional district.

16:16.642 --> 16:19.992
LOGAN: Yeah, well, he might've just
run into a brick wall, Miss Maslin.

16:20.046 --> 16:22.486
The papers say the accusations
of rape are bogus.

16:22.548 --> 16:25.758
Well, that's the word that Talbert's
people are putting out. What do you think?

16:27.753 --> 16:30.263
We can talk to everybody
in the building.

16:31.190 --> 16:32.430
You've got to understand.

16:32.558 --> 16:36.468
The firm likes to see its name in
the law journal, not the tabloids.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.869
And that might be
our next stop.

16:42.902 --> 16:45.182
It was nothing, but it
could be misinterpreted.

16:45.371 --> 16:47.351
Well, why don't you
let us decide that?

16:49.642 --> 16:52.422
A year before Talbert left,

16:52.478 --> 16:55.688
our office manager accused him
of sexual harassment.

16:55.748 --> 16:58.058
We disposed of the matter
before it got out of hand.

16:58.117 --> 17:01.997
Disposed of? As in, "Here's a
check, keep your mouth shut"?

17:02.922 --> 17:07.061
Like I said, it was nothing. This
office manager, is she still here?

17:09.662 --> 17:11.702
That was part
of the settlement, too.

17:13.499 --> 17:15.878
You should have seen them
circle their wagons.

17:15.935 --> 17:18.345
These lawyers,
they protect their own.

17:18.404 --> 17:21.914
So you took the money and ran?
Money? That's a joke.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.852
Talbert had to be
pulling in seven figures,

17:24.911 --> 17:27.981
they gave me a one-time-only
offer of 50 grand.

17:28.047 --> 17:31.487
50 G's. Sounds like a lot
of money to me. Yeah.

17:32.218 --> 17:35.788
Well, he got his money's worth.

17:36.556 --> 17:39.696
It was a Christmas party,
five years ago.

17:40.159 --> 17:44.629
Imagine 300 attorneys at the Cat Club
without their significant others.

17:44.697 --> 17:46.967
So Talbert let his hair down?

17:48.467 --> 17:52.937
Pulled up my skirt in the fire exit.
The guy was all over me.

17:53.306 --> 17:54.716
Did he rape you?

17:54.774 --> 17:58.314
He would have. I tried to fight
back but he's so strong.

17:58.945 --> 18:01.185
Thank God, he heard some
people coming down the hall

18:01.247 --> 18:03.957
and he told them
I had too much to drink.

18:04.016 --> 18:07.826
He was taking me out for some air.
Did anyone see anything?

18:08.888 --> 18:10.868
Sounds like you could have
held out for more money.

18:10.923 --> 18:15.743
Yeah. That's what Sarah said. Sarah?
Sarah Maslin, his partner?

18:16.896 --> 18:20.806
Yeah. I just wanted out of there. She
talked me into seeing an attorney.

18:26.439 --> 18:29.649
It's simple.
It's called libel.

18:29.709 --> 18:31.349
And if this doesn't stop
immediately,

18:31.410 --> 18:35.450
I guarantee all of you will
find yourselves in civil court.

18:35.514 --> 18:37.864
The police are investigating
a charge of rape.

18:37.917 --> 18:41.887
What they're doing is defaming one of
the most honorable men in the city.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.804
I know at least one woman
who would beg to differ.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.357
TALBERT: Jerolyn Addams?

18:47.393 --> 18:51.003
The girl got drunk at an office party.
She had to tell her husband something.

18:51.063 --> 18:54.073
And the $50,000
was just a Christmas bonus?

18:54.133 --> 18:56.943
POWELL: It was blackmail.
Believe me,

18:57.336 --> 19:00.276
if you push this any further,
we'll take her to court, too.

19:00.773 --> 19:04.723
Or didn't she tell you that the settlement
required her to sign a non-disclosure form?

19:04.777 --> 19:06.777
Which is meaningless
in a criminal trial.

19:06.846 --> 19:09.786
But it goes a long way
in civil court.

19:09.849 --> 19:12.229
She opens her mouth,
she returns the $50,000

19:12.285 --> 19:14.525
and turns over
another $100,000 as punitives.

19:14.587 --> 19:17.117
Adam, you're in the public eye.

19:17.189 --> 19:20.099
You know what something like
this can do in an election year.

19:21.427 --> 19:24.997
Good. So I assume
we've heard the last of this?

19:31.971 --> 19:34.711
You're not going to ask us
to back off.

19:35.141 --> 19:36.751
A dead victim.

19:37.944 --> 19:41.454
A witness who could lose her life
savings if she takes the stand.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.494
Look at it from our point
of view, Lieutenant.

19:43.549 --> 19:46.789
Without more, it's not much of a case.
Then we'll get more.

19:49.755 --> 19:51.885
BRISCOE: It does seem
kind of curious, counselor.

19:51.957 --> 19:54.727
You talking the office
manager into suing the firm.

19:54.794 --> 19:58.244
I was trying to do the right thing.
LOGAN: But you told us it was nothing.

19:58.297 --> 20:01.737
Which makes us believe that maybe
you knew she was telling the truth.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.751
BRISCOE: Yeah, and
the question then is how?

20:03.803 --> 20:06.843
Because she told us there weren't any
witnesses at the Christmas party.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.676
LOGAN: Or she could be lying.

20:08.741 --> 20:11.881
But why? There's nothing
to gain from that.

20:17.683 --> 20:19.363
I have nothing to add.

20:19.518 --> 20:23.758
Listen. He almost raped one girl.
Another girl he did rape is dead.

20:23.823 --> 20:26.533
This is a hell of a time
to stonewall.

20:26.592 --> 20:30.472
If there were others, you're
gonna tell us. Eventually.

20:36.335 --> 20:37.905
It was me.

20:39.372 --> 20:41.012
He raped me, too.

20:46.345 --> 20:48.585
I can't believe I'm doing this.

20:48.647 --> 20:51.627
If he raped you... Oh,
he raped me all right.

20:53.352 --> 20:56.962
When we worked together. You
mean over three years ago?

20:57.490 --> 21:01.600
It was late at night at the office.
You didn't go to the police?

21:03.229 --> 21:06.569
I'm an attorney, too, Miss Kincaid.
I know the drill.

21:06.632 --> 21:09.242
A rape trial boils down
to "he said, she said."

21:09.301 --> 21:13.151
And when the "he" is one of the most
respected lawyers on Wall Street,

21:13.205 --> 21:15.275
the "she" doesn't stand
much of a chance.

21:15.341 --> 21:19.021
You're an educated woman.
You're articulate, strong.

21:19.078 --> 21:21.578
People would have believed you.
You don't get it.

21:22.648 --> 21:24.688
It wouldn't have mattered.

21:25.584 --> 21:27.664
I had a career to protect.

21:30.189 --> 21:32.829
I was still an associate
at the firm.

21:34.660 --> 21:37.800
I wanted to become a partner.
What difference would it make?

21:37.863 --> 21:41.213
You were the victim.
I was involved in a scandal.

21:42.868 --> 21:46.178
Clients don't like that much
in their legal advisor.

21:48.974 --> 21:51.354
When it happened,
did you tell anyone?

21:56.682 --> 21:58.032
My doctor.

22:01.687 --> 22:05.067
I start seeing patients
at 8:00 in the morning,

22:05.157 --> 22:07.497
which means
I get here around 7:00.

22:08.294 --> 22:10.874
Sarah was waiting
in the lobby for me.

22:10.930 --> 22:12.310
Did she tell you she was raped?

22:12.364 --> 22:16.444
Not at first. She was more concerned
about disease and pregnancy.

22:16.502 --> 22:19.952
I started giving her my
standard lecture on protection.

22:20.005 --> 22:23.005
She started screaming at me.
That's understandable.

22:23.075 --> 22:26.445
Certainly. Whoever attacked
Sarah took more than her body.

22:26.512 --> 22:29.322
He took her dignity.
Sarah was all about dignity.

22:29.381 --> 22:31.591
What about
physical signs of rape?

22:31.650 --> 22:33.030
Well, I gave her
a full examination.

22:33.085 --> 22:35.565
The problem is there were
physical signs of sex.

22:35.621 --> 22:36.961
But no indication of rape.

22:37.022 --> 22:39.202
Are you saying you don't
believe she was raped?

22:39.725 --> 22:43.995
I've known Sarah for 15 years. If
she said it happened, it happened.

22:45.331 --> 22:48.011
It's just not going to be
easy to prove.

22:48.801 --> 22:50.971
Let me ask you this, Claire.

22:51.537 --> 22:54.417
Just between you and me,
forget about Lyssa.

22:54.473 --> 22:56.013
Forget about
the office manager.

22:56.075 --> 22:58.775
All you've got is Sarah's word
against Talbert's.

23:00.980 --> 23:04.690
Who do you believe? I'm
inclined to believe Sarah.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.696
I think
she's telling the truth.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.129
And with the other evidence?

23:12.424 --> 23:15.174
(SIGHING)
I think Talbert's guilty.

23:16.095 --> 23:18.435
I think we have an obligation
to pursue this.

23:21.834 --> 23:24.014
What kind of witness
will Sarah make?

23:25.004 --> 23:27.314
I looked her up in Martindale.

23:27.806 --> 23:31.046
Summa from Vassar.
Law review at Cornell.

23:31.944 --> 23:34.484
She's head of the securities
department at Adderly, Perkins.

23:34.547 --> 23:37.617
More credibility than the
proverbial busload of nuns.

23:37.683 --> 23:39.863
With Sarah
and the office manager,

23:39.919 --> 23:41.659
we might be able
to establish a pattern.

23:41.720 --> 23:43.830
Even if our victim is dead.

23:44.189 --> 23:46.259
I know
it's a long time ago, Sarah,

23:46.458 --> 23:50.098
but if there's anything,
a torn dress, something.

23:53.265 --> 23:56.905
That's where it happened.
Right there on that couch.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.578
This used to be his office.

24:05.477 --> 24:07.577
It was 4:00 in the morning.

24:08.347 --> 24:12.627
We had just finished an offering
memorandum for B and C Manufacturing.

24:14.086 --> 24:15.996
It took us six months.

24:17.122 --> 24:19.122
He kept a bar over there.

24:20.192 --> 24:23.472
He opened a bottle of
Perrier Jouet to celebrate.

24:26.198 --> 24:28.538
When he left to run for council

24:30.035 --> 24:33.405
they gave me his office.
Lucky me.

24:37.576 --> 24:39.486
I know Spencer Talbert.

24:40.346 --> 24:43.986
I know he raped Lyssa Wesley.
Would you be willing to testify?

24:44.049 --> 24:46.589
We both know that anything I
have to say is inadmissible.

24:46.652 --> 24:49.222
Not if we can convince a judge
there's a pattern.

24:49.288 --> 24:53.788
With two women it's a stretch.
And I can't prove anything.

24:55.661 --> 24:58.571
JACK: Adam, she was in Talbert's
office until 4:00 a.m.

24:58.630 --> 25:01.770
She was in her doctor's office
at 7:00 without an appointment.

25:01.834 --> 25:04.214
And back at her desk
promptly at 9:00.

25:05.904 --> 25:10.284
Now, listen, even if we could prove
that Talbert raped Sarah Maslin,

25:11.009 --> 25:13.619
it's a prior bad act,
it's inadmissible.

25:13.679 --> 25:16.419
Well, then maybe we're making
this whole thing too complicated.

25:16.482 --> 25:19.092
Sarah's our best witness,
let's prosecute her case.

25:19.151 --> 25:23.001
A woman comes forward after three years,
doesn't say too much for her credibility.

25:23.055 --> 25:25.655
She has no reason to lie.
No.

25:25.824 --> 25:30.574
When the mayor, the city council
president, five borough presidents

25:30.629 --> 25:34.239
and the president of the Bar Association
will say that Talbert doesn't either.

25:34.299 --> 25:36.279
JACK: Good. Let them all
take the stand.

25:36.335 --> 25:40.075
The best thing Talbert can do
is put his character in issue.

25:40.472 --> 25:42.952
There are already two other
women that we know of.

25:43.008 --> 25:45.778
One who took a $50,000 payoff.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.718
One who's
conveniently deceased.

25:49.548 --> 25:53.518
And this one, for all we know,
could be an affair gone bad.

25:53.585 --> 25:56.525
Adam, the papers already
know all about this.

25:56.955 --> 26:00.325
If we drop it, guess whose
name's gonna hit the op-ed page

26:00.392 --> 26:02.742
as part
of a political cover-up?

26:04.229 --> 26:06.069
What the hell is that?

26:06.231 --> 26:10.271
You believe in the case, you prosecute it.
Don't lay this off on me!

26:13.639 --> 26:19.059
"Docket number 561253. People v.
Spencer Randolph Talbert."

26:19.111 --> 26:21.611
"The charge is rape
in the first degree."

26:22.781 --> 26:24.661
How do you plead?
Not guilty.

26:24.717 --> 26:27.197
The People request bail
of $100,000.

26:27.252 --> 26:29.932
For what?
These charges are outrageous.

26:29.989 --> 26:33.129
My client has served the public
faithfully for four years.

26:33.192 --> 26:37.272
His record is exemplary. And
I'll be sure to vote for him.

26:37.563 --> 26:39.983
Bail set as requested. Next.

26:40.699 --> 26:43.509
Do you actually think you can
get a conviction, Miss Kincaid?

26:43.569 --> 26:44.879
That'll be up to the jury.

26:44.970 --> 26:47.780
A majority of whom probably
voted for the councilman.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.290
Even if he is acquitted,
Miss Powell,

26:49.341 --> 26:51.751
do you think this is the end
of his political career?

26:51.810 --> 26:54.650
Councilman Talbert is devoted
to public service.

26:54.713 --> 26:58.493
He will not allow this smear campaign to
diminish his commitment to this city.

26:58.917 --> 27:03.367
What is it? You people are hell-bent
on destroying my client's career.

27:03.722 --> 27:05.932
I think
he's done that all by himself.

27:05.991 --> 27:07.371
I was Sarah Maslin's boss.

27:07.426 --> 27:09.996
Maybe I was too tough on her,
too demanding.

27:10.896 --> 27:12.736
Is this payback time?

27:13.365 --> 27:16.345
And what's your angle, Mr. McCoy? You
have your eye on Gracie Mansion?

27:16.401 --> 27:18.181
No, I don't like politics.

27:18.237 --> 27:21.617
And I don't much care for politicians.
But I won't hold your job against you.

27:22.541 --> 27:25.991
We know Sarah was in the office
with Mr. Talbert past 4:00 a.m.

27:26.045 --> 27:28.245
We know she went immediately
to her doctor.

27:28.313 --> 27:29.493
We know she had sex.

27:29.548 --> 27:33.088
And if you'd had the decency to
call me before you sent your goons,

27:33.152 --> 27:35.062
maybe you would have heard
an explanation.

27:37.389 --> 27:40.389
Are you admitting you
had sex with her? Yes.

27:41.126 --> 27:44.196
Not only was it consensual,
it wasn't very good.

27:47.966 --> 27:50.166
You really are
a piece of work, Mr. Talbert.

27:50.235 --> 27:53.265
Sarah Maslin will make
a very credible witness.

27:53.338 --> 27:56.838
That may be. But we have
a witness of our own.

27:57.976 --> 28:02.786
Mr. Talbert's former secretary was working
right outside his office that night.

28:03.715 --> 28:06.055
Don't you think she might
have heard something?

28:08.520 --> 28:12.490
I'll tell you what, with Talbert I
made twice the money I make now.

28:12.558 --> 28:14.088
All the overtime.

28:14.159 --> 28:18.039
So if he stayed until 4:00 in the morning?
I was right outside his door.

28:18.096 --> 28:20.126
With him
there were 11 commandments.

28:20.199 --> 28:25.009
"Thou shalt not answer thine own phone,
take smoke breaks, or go to the bathroom."

28:25.070 --> 28:26.310
He got calls at that hour?

28:26.371 --> 28:30.411
During the B and C thing, the phone didn't stop.
Calls from overseas.

28:30.475 --> 28:33.815
Accountants, printers. The office
was working day and night.

28:33.879 --> 28:36.329
Was Sarah Maslin
typically here with him?

28:36.381 --> 28:38.731
As long as I was here,
they were joined at the hip.

28:38.784 --> 28:41.164
And you're sure you would
have heard an argument

28:41.220 --> 28:42.790
or a raised voice
from his office?

28:42.854 --> 28:45.994
Believe me, I've heard him yelling
for me through that door more times

28:46.058 --> 28:47.588
than I care to count.

28:48.093 --> 28:52.473
Look, if what you're saying actually
happened, I would have known.

28:55.968 --> 28:59.068
Don't you think you should have
asked me before you ruined my life?

29:00.472 --> 29:04.822
You said you were willing to testify.
No, I never said that.

29:04.877 --> 29:08.257
I had a reason for keeping
this private for three years.

29:08.313 --> 29:11.063
But you came forward now.
The police came to me.

29:11.116 --> 29:14.526
I only went along with it so you
wouldn't drop the Lyssa Wesley case.

29:15.554 --> 29:18.194
I never thought
I'd have to go public.

29:19.925 --> 29:23.335
Now the press
is all over my office.

29:23.395 --> 29:26.035
They're in the lobby
of my apartment.

29:26.098 --> 29:30.168
I can't live like this, Miss Kincaid.
We can convict him, Sarah.

29:32.170 --> 29:34.410
Well, you're gonna have to
do it without me.

29:36.775 --> 29:39.805
She has a press conference
scheduled for tomorrow morning.

29:39.878 --> 29:43.348
My guess, she's going to deny everything.
We put her up to it.

29:45.117 --> 29:46.687
Did we, Claire?

29:47.819 --> 29:50.489
Did personal feeling cause us
to be a bit over-enthusiastic?

29:50.555 --> 29:52.725
You were the one who decided
to prosecute Sarah's case.

29:52.791 --> 29:55.401
You're the one who assured
me she was raped.

29:58.030 --> 30:01.140
Anyone in this office
keep up on current events?

30:02.701 --> 30:05.341
"Talbert's accuser
member of fem-lib PAC."

30:05.404 --> 30:07.714
So she's politically active.

30:07.773 --> 30:09.553
It doesn't prove he's innocent.

30:09.608 --> 30:14.418
She is spearheading a drive to
block Talbert's congressional run.

30:14.479 --> 30:17.949
She's not fond of his voting
record on women's issues.

30:18.317 --> 30:21.197
Neither am I.
I gave them money. So what?

30:21.253 --> 30:24.103
Yeah, but you did not
accuse the man of rape.

30:25.390 --> 30:28.390
I'm starting to think Sarah
Maslin is using the DA's office

30:28.460 --> 30:31.000
as the blade
in a political hatchet job.

30:32.764 --> 30:36.274
Fine. Don't believe me.
Drop the whole thing.

30:37.469 --> 30:39.209
That's what I want anyway.

30:39.271 --> 30:42.651
Well, the case against Talbert
is dropped, Miss Maslin.

30:43.075 --> 30:46.075
The case against you for
conspiracy is just beginning.

30:46.878 --> 30:49.088
It does look
a little strange, Sarah.

30:49.648 --> 30:52.388
You wait until he's running
for Congress to come forward.

30:52.451 --> 30:55.331
I came forward
because of the other women.

30:55.387 --> 30:58.197
And why were there no
physical indications of rape?

30:59.558 --> 31:02.268
Why didn't his secretary
hear anything?

31:08.867 --> 31:10.737
You consented, didn't you?

31:20.812 --> 31:23.052
He was going to ruin my life.

31:30.589 --> 31:32.299
Sure I consented.

31:33.191 --> 31:35.691
But I didn't have
any other choice.

31:36.361 --> 31:40.711
He told me if I didn't sleep with
him I wouldn't make partner.

31:41.400 --> 31:44.010
He'd blackball me
from any other job.

31:46.638 --> 31:49.808
I killed myself
for eight years.

31:57.616 --> 32:01.086
I deserved to be a partner
in this law firm, Mr. McCoy.

32:09.261 --> 32:11.371
In her mind she was raped.

32:11.430 --> 32:14.380
Unfortunately the people
who drafted the penal law

32:14.433 --> 32:16.343
are not bouncing around
in her head.

32:16.401 --> 32:18.281
She put in eight years
at that firm.

32:18.336 --> 32:21.806
He was going to take away any chance of
promotion if she didn't sleep with him.

32:21.873 --> 32:26.323
So he's a pig. He belongs in a sty, not a prison.
There is no crime here.

32:26.978 --> 32:29.788
Sexual harassment does not
equal forcible compulsion.

32:29.848 --> 32:33.128
But in this case it could
be larceny by extortion.

32:33.885 --> 32:36.155
Talbert forced Sarah
to give him property

32:36.221 --> 32:39.001
by instilling in her
the fear that he would

32:39.257 --> 32:42.497
"materially harm her
business calling or career."

32:42.561 --> 32:45.741
What property did she give him?
Her body.

32:47.733 --> 32:51.013
It fits the literal requirements
of the statute, Adam.

32:51.636 --> 32:52.976
Wonderful.

32:54.005 --> 32:57.945
So now all we have to do
is convince this woman

32:58.009 --> 33:01.619
to admit in open court that
she slept her way to the top.

33:05.384 --> 33:09.164
You must be out of your mind.
We both want Talbert in prison.

33:09.688 --> 33:11.898
I slept with him
to save my career.

33:11.957 --> 33:14.527
I don't especially feel
like ruining it now.

33:14.593 --> 33:17.163
Look, I know
it could be awkward.

33:17.229 --> 33:18.369
Look,

33:18.597 --> 33:22.477
I know we like to see ourselves as
lawyers who happen to be women.

33:23.134 --> 33:27.614
That's fine and good, but the fact
is we're perceived as women first

33:27.706 --> 33:29.306
and lawyers second.

33:29.374 --> 33:32.914
And you're willing to live with that?
That's how it is, Claire.

33:33.578 --> 33:37.748
I was a bright young attorney
with a great future ahead of me.

33:37.816 --> 33:40.796
And I actually thought that
Talbert recognized that, too.

33:40.852 --> 33:44.032
But all he was thinking
was getting between my legs.

33:44.089 --> 33:47.329
Maybe you should have kicked him between
his and hauled him into civil court.

33:47.392 --> 33:50.842
Sounds easy,
but then it happens.

33:53.365 --> 33:57.775
I'm faced with losing
everything I've worked for,

33:59.404 --> 34:00.854
and I think,

34:01.706 --> 34:05.476
"How bad can it be?
It's only one time."

34:07.612 --> 34:10.022
Because you were
forced to think that.

34:10.081 --> 34:12.291
By this bastard
who stood in your way.

34:15.620 --> 34:20.070
If I testify, the story will be I
used sex to get a partnership.

34:20.125 --> 34:23.264
And if you don't, the story will be
you're just another radical feminist

34:23.328 --> 34:25.428
using sex
to destroy a political enemy.

34:25.496 --> 34:28.437
I became politically active
because of what he did to me.

34:28.500 --> 34:31.969
But no one's ever gonna know that
as long as you remain silent.

34:34.105 --> 34:38.275
This has to be a joke.
Larceny by extortion?

34:39.143 --> 34:43.184
That's when the mob says, "Pay up
or I'll burn down your restaurant."

34:43.481 --> 34:47.161
"Sleep with me or I'll destroy
your career." Same thing.

34:47.219 --> 34:49.719
To make out a case
for extortion,

34:49.788 --> 34:52.928
you have to plead value
with specificity, Mr. McCoy.

34:52.991 --> 34:55.201
Exactly my point, Your Honor.

34:55.760 --> 34:59.170
Although I agree that,
metaphorically and poetically,

34:59.231 --> 35:01.371
a woman's body
may be priceless,

35:01.900 --> 35:05.250
but scientifically,
it'll get you $8.84.

35:05.303 --> 35:06.753
And that's a misdemeanor.

35:06.805 --> 35:09.505
And legally, it's worth what
someone is willing to pay for it.

35:09.574 --> 35:13.354
In this case the value of a
partnership in a major law firm.

35:13.745 --> 35:15.345
And that makes it a felony.

35:15.413 --> 35:19.123
Do you have an expert to quantify that?
I do, Your Honor.

35:19.184 --> 35:23.794
May I remind Your Honor that it is
not his place to write new law.

35:25.123 --> 35:29.403
Nothing new here, counselor.
Just expanding the old.

35:34.266 --> 35:38.366
HENDRICKS: At the time of the incident
Miss Maslin was 32 years old.

35:38.436 --> 35:42.706
Assuming that she worked
until standard retirement,

35:42.774 --> 35:46.314
that would give her 33 more
years as a working attorney.

35:46.378 --> 35:50.158
What is the average compensation
for a partner at Adderly, Perkins?

35:50.215 --> 35:52.695
HENDRICKS: According to
The American Lawyer magazine,

35:52.751 --> 35:55.161
the average partner
profit participation

35:55.220 --> 35:58.030
was a little over
$500,000 per year.

35:58.089 --> 36:01.699
So over those 33 years, Miss
Maslin could expect to earn

36:01.760 --> 36:03.830
about $16.5 million?

36:03.895 --> 36:05.095
That's correct.

36:09.234 --> 36:11.614
How many law firms are there
in the city, sir?

36:11.670 --> 36:15.310
Of the caliber of Adderly,
Perkins? I'd say perhaps 100.

36:15.640 --> 36:17.450
Is it possible that Miss Maslin

36:17.509 --> 36:19.919
could have obtained employment
in one of those firms?

36:19.978 --> 36:22.358
There's a big difference between
employment and partnership.

36:22.414 --> 36:26.164
So you're saying that she could not
have become a partner elsewhere?

36:26.218 --> 36:27.788
In the early '80s, perhaps,

36:27.852 --> 36:30.362
but the legal business has suffered
just like everything else.

36:30.422 --> 36:33.532
I'd say it was unlikely.
But not impossible?

36:35.594 --> 36:36.604
No.

36:38.930 --> 36:40.810
As a practicing psychologist,

36:40.866 --> 36:44.506
I have reviewed thousands of cases of
sexual harassment in the workplace.

36:44.569 --> 36:48.709
Have you found that there is a
typical reaction to such harassment?

36:48.773 --> 36:51.253
Well, it really depends on the
extent of the harassment.

36:51.309 --> 36:52.689
Some women go public.

36:52.744 --> 36:55.324
Some choose to leave their
place of employment quietly

36:55.380 --> 36:57.450
and others just suffer
in silence.

36:57.516 --> 37:00.256
But all of them describe it
as a demeaning experience.

37:00.318 --> 37:03.318
Why do some choose to put up
with this kind of behavior?

37:03.388 --> 37:06.388
There's a sense of impotence,
of futility.

37:06.458 --> 37:11.368
So in essence, some of these
women feel they can't leave.

37:12.163 --> 37:13.643
That's correct.

37:19.871 --> 37:22.511
Sexual harassment
isn't a crime, is it?

37:24.075 --> 37:25.105
No.

37:25.176 --> 37:28.486
But offering sex
for financial gain is?

37:28.546 --> 37:31.686
Your Honor. What do you
expect, Mr. McCoy?

37:31.783 --> 37:35.423
Overruled.
It's called prostitution.

37:36.888 --> 37:39.098
Miss Maslin
is hardly a prostitute.

37:39.157 --> 37:41.867
Why?
Because she has a law degree?

37:49.968 --> 37:51.878
If I buy you a drink,

37:51.936 --> 37:55.176
you promise not to charge me
with assault in the morning?

37:56.141 --> 37:58.851
If you promise
not to call me a hooker.

38:00.445 --> 38:04.145
J&B, neat. She's buying
me a vodka on the rocks.

38:04.215 --> 38:07.685
My client may be
two steps below a leech

38:07.752 --> 38:09.862
on the evolutionary chain,

38:11.022 --> 38:13.302
but that doesn't
make him a criminal.

38:14.259 --> 38:16.359
I know you know that, Jack.

38:16.962 --> 38:21.472
Be careful. The Women's Bar Association
will take away your membership card.

38:21.933 --> 38:25.513
So be it. I'm tired of sitting
around drinking herbal tea

38:25.570 --> 38:29.520
and complaining how tough
it is wearing a skirt.

38:30.141 --> 38:33.151
You'd rather lead a life
of quiet desperation?

38:36.214 --> 38:39.164
Sleeping with the enemy
is no solution.

38:39.751 --> 38:41.751
Passivity is the culprit.

38:42.253 --> 38:45.103
Think of yourself as a victim,
you become a victim.

38:48.460 --> 38:51.810
While you were an associate
at Adderly, Perkins,

38:51.863 --> 38:55.143
how many hours did you
typically bill per year?

38:55.200 --> 38:58.840
Over 3,000. Far and away
the most in the firm.

38:58.903 --> 39:01.473
Was that because you were slower
than the other associates?

39:01.539 --> 39:04.819
It was because
I had the largest caseload.

39:04.876 --> 39:06.446
At any given time

39:06.511 --> 39:10.021
I had a couple of dozen
active deals on my desk.

39:11.049 --> 39:14.589
So you worked for all the
partners in your department.

39:14.652 --> 39:15.862
On occasion.

39:15.920 --> 39:20.490
But I'd have to say 90% of my
work was for Spencer Talbert.

39:22.694 --> 39:26.074
Did you mind that?
At first it concerned me.

39:26.131 --> 39:31.101
To make partner you need the votes
of the majority of the partnership.

39:32.303 --> 39:35.283
But Mr. Talbert assured me
I shouldn't worry.

39:35.340 --> 39:39.250
And you believed him? He said
people vote as he votes.

39:40.111 --> 39:43.681
And he assured you
that you had his vote?

39:44.415 --> 39:47.485
He said
if I didn't sleep with him...

39:48.920 --> 39:53.890
I didn't have a chance to make partner
at Adderly, Perkins or any other firm.

39:53.958 --> 39:58.568
A partnership was that important to you?
Yes. I earned it.

40:02.834 --> 40:05.144
You could have gotten it elsewhere.
You could have left.

40:05.203 --> 40:06.883
A black woman

40:06.938 --> 40:10.908
who works eight years at a
firm only to get pushed out.

40:12.777 --> 40:15.517
You tell me,
where was I going to go?

40:20.351 --> 40:23.661
Did Mr. Talbert put a
gun to your head? No.

40:25.223 --> 40:28.603
Did he handcuff you?
No.

40:28.660 --> 40:32.160
Did he stick a sock in your mouth?
I'm not claiming he raped me.

40:32.230 --> 40:35.370
But once upon a time you did,
isn't that right?

40:35.433 --> 40:36.573
Yes.

40:36.935 --> 40:39.035
And that accusation was a lie,
wasn't it?

40:39.103 --> 40:42.113
You willingly consented to
have sex with my client.

40:42.173 --> 40:45.593
He threatened to ruin my career.
I see.

40:47.111 --> 40:51.491
How much money would you have made
had you remained a senior associate?

40:52.016 --> 40:54.456
$150,000 a year.

40:54.519 --> 40:55.929
Sounds like utter ruin to me.

40:55.987 --> 40:58.927
No. That's not the point.
It wasn't about the money.

40:58.990 --> 41:03.670
Well, that's a shame, counselor.
Because as it turns out for my client,

41:03.728 --> 41:07.138
it was the most expensive
roll in the hay in history.

41:10.501 --> 41:12.811
I bring in more business

41:12.871 --> 41:15.611
than any other lawyer
in the firm.

41:16.874 --> 41:19.724
I teach securities
at Columbia Law School.

41:20.478 --> 41:24.448
I chair several committees
at the Bar Association.

41:28.219 --> 41:32.169
I've drafted legislation
passed by Congress.

41:32.690 --> 41:36.230
No, counselor,
the shame of it is

41:36.294 --> 41:38.544
I couldn't have done
any of those things

41:38.596 --> 41:41.336
if I hadn't spread my legs
for your client.

41:56.781 --> 42:00.891
The People rest, Your Honor. Call
your first witness, Miss Powell.

42:02.820 --> 42:04.730
The defense rests as well,
Your Honor.

42:04.789 --> 42:07.999
Well, we can have summations
tomorrow morning.

42:09.994 --> 42:13.174
No witnesses. I'd say
Powell's a bit overconfident.

42:13.231 --> 42:14.841
Why shouldn't she be?

42:14.899 --> 42:18.239
You're asking the jury to create a
crime behind the legislature's back.

42:18.303 --> 42:21.843
That's because the legislature never
conceived of anything like this.

42:21.906 --> 42:24.936
There are seven women on the jury.
Which leaves five men.

42:25.009 --> 42:28.979
All of whom have probably fantasized
about their own co-workers.

42:30.682 --> 42:31.922
So what?

42:33.418 --> 42:37.488
If we assume that everything
Sarah Maslin said is true,

42:38.890 --> 42:42.670
my client is the quintessential
sexist son of a bitch.

42:43.528 --> 42:47.368
He not only took advantage of
Miss Maslin, he demeaned her.

42:47.432 --> 42:50.852
He humiliated her.
He destroyed her dignity.

42:51.602 --> 42:56.022
As a woman, I'd like to go over
there and smack him in the head.

42:56.808 --> 43:00.878
But as an officer of the
court, all I can do is say,

43:01.312 --> 43:02.762
"So what?"

43:05.383 --> 43:09.093
Sarah Maslin was ambitious.
She wanted to get ahead

43:09.153 --> 43:13.603
and she got what she wanted
by her own choice.

43:14.092 --> 43:16.832
She alone determined her fate.

43:18.263 --> 43:21.343
Sure she may be
emotionally distraught.

43:21.733 --> 43:24.543
But under the law,
you hurt someone's feelings,

43:24.602 --> 43:28.742
you take out your checkbook.
You do not go to jail.

43:31.509 --> 43:33.149
Give me the keys to your house

43:34.645 --> 43:36.955
or I'll charge you with murder.

43:38.282 --> 43:40.962
I'm the DA, I can do it.

43:45.490 --> 43:47.400
Give me $10,000

43:48.392 --> 43:52.572
or I'll tell the Feds about that shipment
of heroin I saw you pick up at JFK.

43:53.498 --> 43:56.408
I'm the DA, they'll listen.

44:00.037 --> 44:01.707
What would you do?

44:04.609 --> 44:08.109
I can tell you what I'll be doing
for the next ten years or so.

44:08.179 --> 44:10.159
I'll be in Attica.

44:10.982 --> 44:15.162
Because what I did is called extortion.
And it's a felony.

44:17.221 --> 44:22.031
Sleep with me or I'll tell your boss
that you're under indictment for fraud.

44:23.594 --> 44:28.104
It's not true, but do you really
think you'll be working next week?

44:32.904 --> 44:35.894
Sarah Maslin
worked for eight years.

44:36.407 --> 44:40.817
She was the best, the most
productive associate in her firm.

44:41.212 --> 44:45.292
She had clearly earned a partnership.
But the only way that she could get it

44:45.349 --> 44:49.919
was to have sex with the man who had
the power to make or break her career.

44:53.124 --> 44:54.664
Sarah Maslin

44:56.761 --> 44:59.501
laid down on that couch
for Mr. Talbert.

45:03.301 --> 45:06.581
But can any of us say
that she really had a choice?

45:18.783 --> 45:22.233
JUDGE SCHREIBER: Have you reached a verdict?
We have, Your Honor.

45:22.687 --> 45:24.387
On the sole count
of the indictment,

45:24.455 --> 45:27.725
grand larceny in the first
degree, how do you find?

45:28.559 --> 45:30.839
We find the defendant guilty.

45:34.165 --> 45:37.695
The defendant is remanded
to custody pending sentencing.

45:38.402 --> 45:40.112
(GAVEL BANGING)
Court is adjourned.

45:46.277 --> 45:50.347
Nothing like making new law.
Enjoy it for three months.

45:50.415 --> 45:52.285
I'm not so sure
it'll be reversed.

45:52.350 --> 45:54.730
Well, it's not the appellate
court I'm worried about.

45:54.786 --> 45:57.726
You think the legislature
will pre-empt them?

45:57.789 --> 46:01.899
I think the jails will be
too crowded if they don't.
