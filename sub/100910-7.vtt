00:05.339 --> 00:06.607
Previously on Hightown...

00:06.640 --> 00:08.275
How hard is it
to hide a body in the ocean?

00:08.309 --> 00:09.410
It's the fucking ocean.

00:09.443 --> 00:11.612
You're the lady that's been
asking questions about me.

00:14.081 --> 00:17.418
You think you're special, don't
you? But he was fucking the last
one, too.

00:17.451 --> 00:19.487
- What are you talking about?
- Sherry Henry.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.721
Remember when I was your snitch?

00:20.755 --> 00:22.256
That's over now, okay?

00:22.289 --> 00:23.624
- No!
- Come on, stick her!

00:23.657 --> 00:25.159
- No!
- Push it in!

00:26.694 --> 00:30.131
You gonna wake up every day
thinking, "I'm a killer."

00:30.164 --> 00:34.235
And then one day, you gonna wake
up, and you gonna think about
breakfast.

00:34.268 --> 00:35.336
And life goes on.

00:36.604 --> 00:39.373
Someone told you Krista was
talking about you and Sherry
Henry,

00:39.407 --> 00:42.243
and you think this fucking kid
ain't gonna flip on you?

00:42.777 --> 00:45.613
40-something fishing boats went
out across the Cape, three at
night.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.181
- Any of them come back?
- One.

03:34.982 --> 03:36.850
State Police.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.352
Turn your engine off, please.

03:42.856 --> 03:43.958
What's your name?

03:45.292 --> 03:46.293
Sherry.

03:46.794 --> 03:48.395
Are you holding, Sherry?

03:48.429 --> 03:51.498
No. I'm clean.

03:51.532 --> 03:53.968
So when I search your car,
I'm not gonna find any dope?

04:01.008 --> 04:02.776
What is this? Like,
a hundred Oxys?

04:03.611 --> 04:04.612
Fuck you, man.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.981
Sherry, you seem
like a nice girl.

04:08.449 --> 04:10.250
I don't want to
have to jam you up.

04:10.985 --> 04:11.986
Then don't.

04:13.954 --> 04:16.323
Let me off with a warning.

04:18.525 --> 04:20.327
I don't know, maybe
if you cooperate...

04:21.929 --> 04:25.032
You give me a little something,
we can help each other out.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.266
Okay.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.370
I'll give you head.

04:30.004 --> 04:31.739
Oh, yeah?

04:31.772 --> 04:34.375
No, Ray, you don't understand.

04:35.509 --> 04:37.611
I meant I'll give you my head.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.669
Hey, Jack, slow down!

05:01.702 --> 05:02.836
There she is.

05:02.870 --> 05:05.339
Why you got such a hard-on
for the Jack and Bobby?

05:05.372 --> 05:06.507
No reason.

05:20.387 --> 05:21.422
So you catching 'em?

05:21.455 --> 05:23.390
Going out more and
bringing home less.

05:23.424 --> 05:24.825
What the fuck is that about?

05:24.858 --> 05:26.660
Global warming. Fuck
Trump, am I right?

05:26.694 --> 05:28.862
Yeah, fuck him.
He deregulated everything else.

05:28.896 --> 05:31.365
So why is the fishery service
still getting up my ass?

05:31.398 --> 05:34.034
Well, someone's got
to keep you honest.

05:34.068 --> 05:35.069
Which reminds me...

05:35.903 --> 05:37.504
You go out August 22nd?

05:38.072 --> 05:39.373
I don't know.

05:39.406 --> 05:41.442
Check the log. It says
I did, then I did.

05:51.118 --> 05:53.520
20th, 21st...

05:53.554 --> 05:54.988
August 22nd...

05:56.824 --> 05:58.058
Doesn't look like it.

05:58.092 --> 06:00.594
Any chance somebody took
the boat out and didn't log it?

06:00.627 --> 06:02.129
Maybe Junior?

06:02.362 --> 06:03.630
What's this about?

06:04.665 --> 06:05.766
Oh, just another case.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.001
How's he doing, by the way?

06:08.035 --> 06:09.036
He's good.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.971
Thanks for asking. We done here?

06:11.004 --> 06:12.005
Yep.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.040
Thanks, Mike.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.479
So you think
Michael's a good dude?

06:19.580 --> 06:21.782
- You want to tell me why you're
asking? - Nope.

06:22.816 --> 06:25.385
- And what about Junior?
- I thought you guys were
friends.

06:25.419 --> 06:27.121
Yeah, but you've known
him his whole life.

06:27.154 --> 06:31.492
Well, he's always had his
troubles. Even before the drugs,
he was a punk.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.827
Boosting his dad's car,
joyriding, stuff like that.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.763
Yeah, I mean, that's not so bad.

06:35.796 --> 06:38.766
And one time, I caught him
tagging a pylon under the pier.

06:38.799 --> 06:41.034
Stood there with both hands
covered with spray paint,

06:41.068 --> 06:43.137
looked me square in
the eye, and lied.

06:43.170 --> 06:45.072
He knew I knew,
but he didn't care.

06:46.039 --> 06:47.674
Well, that was
then. How about now?

06:48.142 --> 06:50.410
Oh, once a liar, always a liar.

07:25.012 --> 07:26.547
Hey.

07:26.580 --> 07:27.981
Morning.

07:28.015 --> 07:29.449
Morning.

07:29.483 --> 07:30.484
You hungry?

07:31.852 --> 07:33.854
- You made me breakfast?
- Yes, I did.

07:33.887 --> 07:34.955
Oh, my God.

07:36.590 --> 07:37.958
That's so sweet.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.829
- Hey, here you go.
- Thank you.

07:46.533 --> 07:48.836
- What's Frankie doing?
- Oh, we made a fort.

07:48.869 --> 07:51.205
He ate, like, three scrambled
eggs. Now he's watching TV.

07:51.238 --> 07:52.973
- You got him to eat eggs?
- Yeah.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.742
Oh, that's...

07:55.776 --> 07:56.977
Crazy.

08:03.717 --> 08:05.652
This is amazing.

08:05.686 --> 08:06.687
Thank you.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.857
What, you never had
breakfast in bed before?

08:10.490 --> 08:15.095
I mean, I've had breakfast
in a bed before.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.232
I don't know.

08:18.265 --> 08:19.666
Maybe I haven't.

08:27.608 --> 08:28.642
What's up?

08:36.116 --> 08:38.919
I know that it's
complicated on my end.

08:39.820 --> 08:42.923
But I was just wondering if...

08:44.024 --> 08:47.561
...you know, it's just us.

08:48.295 --> 08:50.898
You mean, like, is there another
girl I'm making breakfast for?

08:51.932 --> 08:53.267
I don't know, you know.

08:54.301 --> 08:55.903
That's why I'm asking.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.138
'Cause I just...

08:59.673 --> 09:01.208
...want to know if I'm special.

09:02.876 --> 09:03.911
Where's this coming from?

09:08.248 --> 09:09.750
I just don't really get it.

09:10.817 --> 09:13.120
You know, why me?

09:14.721 --> 09:17.791
- What's so great about me?
- Come here.

09:17.824 --> 09:18.959
Look at you.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.562
You're amazing.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.098
You're beautiful.

09:25.132 --> 09:28.568
Yeah, I know how I look.
That's not what I'm asking.

09:30.604 --> 09:31.805
You know, you...

09:33.140 --> 09:36.643
You're this handsome dude
with this great job, and...

09:37.644 --> 09:40.614
...that's why you...

09:40.647 --> 09:41.648
You know?

09:44.117 --> 09:45.319
Why me?

09:49.256 --> 09:50.991
Look at me.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.326
At first...

09:53.593 --> 09:54.928
...it was because of Frankie.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.265
Okay? I needed information.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.033
So this was transactional.

10:00.834 --> 10:05.339
And I know how bad that sounds,
but that's the truth.

10:05.372 --> 10:06.373
Okay.

10:10.377 --> 10:11.945
Why now?

10:11.979 --> 10:13.947
Because you make
me feel so good...

10:15.315 --> 10:17.951
...like the world isn't
some giant ball of shit.

10:20.120 --> 10:24.057
And I haven't felt that way
in a long, long fucking time.

10:46.413 --> 10:48.315
Oh, fuck.

10:48.348 --> 10:49.349
Fuck.

10:50.283 --> 10:52.386
Fuck! Fuck.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.154
Fuck, baby, I got to go to work.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.823
I can't. I can't. I can't.

10:58.392 --> 11:00.694
Hey. Hey, if it's all right with
you, I'll come back tonight.

11:00.727 --> 11:02.229
- Yeah.
- Cool.

11:03.063 --> 11:04.965
- Tomorrow, too?
- Yeah.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.666
- Day after tomorrow?
- Yeah.

11:44.738 --> 11:45.772
Fuck.

11:56.083 --> 11:57.818
Motherfucker!

12:30.784 --> 12:32.152
Call me back from a clean line.

12:52.172 --> 12:53.273
Hey, what's up?

12:53.306 --> 12:54.841
Heard you got pinched.

12:55.342 --> 12:56.810
Yeah, but I'm straight.

12:56.843 --> 12:58.879
No, you fucked up.

12:59.346 --> 13:01.481
What part of hot
shot didn't you get?

13:03.016 --> 13:05.252
She wouldn't take it,
so I had to improvise.

13:07.387 --> 13:08.955
Cops know what's up?

13:10.190 --> 13:14.127
No, but that one guy got a real
hard-on for you, Abruzzo.

13:17.864 --> 13:19.166
You think they
know about Junior?

13:21.001 --> 13:22.035
Maybe.

13:23.403 --> 13:24.905
Probably.

13:24.938 --> 13:25.939
You know, but he's cool.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.309
"He's cool."

13:31.278 --> 13:32.479
You know what I like about you?

13:34.014 --> 13:36.550
You're a stand-up
guy. You're loyal.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.820
You're a stupid,
fat Haitian fuck!

13:42.255 --> 13:44.224
But at least I know
you ain't talking to no cops.

13:45.258 --> 13:48.128
Junior, I don't know.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.364
I want you to take care of it.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.604
Yeah, okay.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.906
You got a problem with that?

13:59.940 --> 14:01.208
I didn't say nothing.

14:03.944 --> 14:06.079
Kizzle got out this
morning. Take him.

14:07.247 --> 14:08.882
You think you can handle it?

14:11.251 --> 14:12.285
No problem.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.121
You need anything else?

14:15.155 --> 14:16.456
Heard Scotty got pinched.

14:17.490 --> 14:18.625
I got it under control.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.942
Scotty Frazier.

14:44.517 --> 14:46.286
Can I get an extra cranberry?

14:47.654 --> 14:49.222
Oh, shit! I need help here!

14:49.256 --> 14:51.057
Get on the ground!
Put your hands up!

14:51.091 --> 14:53.193
I need help here.
Code red! Code red!

14:53.226 --> 14:55.028
Lockdown. Lockdown.

14:55.061 --> 14:57.430
On the ground!
Get your hands up!

14:57.464 --> 14:59.399
Lockdown!

14:59.432 --> 15:01.067
Hit the floor!

16:17.243 --> 16:18.378
Patty?

16:18.411 --> 16:19.646
What am I looking at here?

16:19.679 --> 16:21.581
Pole cam feed on O'Donnell's.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.184
What the fuck happened to it?

16:25.251 --> 16:27.754
I don't know. I
think it got broken.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.489
Thanks, Mickey.

16:30.724 --> 16:32.025
- What's up?
- Come here.

16:34.127 --> 16:35.662
So the dude from the motor court

16:35.695 --> 16:38.498
just got his throat slit
in Sagamore County Jail.

16:38.531 --> 16:41.201
- Scotty Frazier?
- Yeah.

16:41.234 --> 16:42.235
Oh, shit.

16:42.268 --> 16:45.305
In the infirmary, 20
feet from a doctor.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.273
They're just rubbing
my nose in it now.

16:48.475 --> 16:51.111
- You know what this means,
right? - We got ourselves a
white-boy problem.

16:51.144 --> 16:52.245
Yeah, we do.

16:52.278 --> 16:55.014
Hey, everybody.
Can I get your attention,
please?

16:55.048 --> 16:56.416
Guys.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.318
Listen up. I don't
want to repeat myself.

16:58.752 --> 17:00.320
Frankie Cuevas is
cleaning house.

17:00.353 --> 17:03.089
Our key witness in the Collins
murder just ate shit in lockup.

17:03.123 --> 17:04.124
Fuck.

17:04.157 --> 17:05.525
That kid we had in
the box yesterday?

17:05.558 --> 17:07.794
Yes, that kid.
So you see this white boy right
here?

17:08.027 --> 17:09.429
He could be next.

17:09.462 --> 17:10.663
If this dude eats shit,

17:10.697 --> 17:12.432
we're fucked for pinning
Collins on Frankie.

17:12.465 --> 17:14.033
You understand? We clear?

17:14.067 --> 17:15.235
What's the play?

17:15.268 --> 17:16.703
Somebody's got to know
the kid, all right?

17:16.736 --> 17:18.538
So hit every trap house,
drag all your CIs.

17:18.571 --> 17:21.408
We got to find him before he
gets his throat slit, too.

17:30.183 --> 17:31.184
Hey.

17:32.118 --> 17:34.621
Oh, hey. What are
you doing here?

17:35.655 --> 17:36.723
Jesus.

17:38.691 --> 17:40.326
What are you doing here?

17:41.661 --> 17:44.264
Well, you left your jacket at my
place, and I thought you might
need it.

17:44.297 --> 17:45.432
- Yeah, I don't.
- Okay.

17:45.465 --> 17:46.733
- You can't come here.
- All right, okay.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.468
Yeah, why?

17:48.501 --> 17:49.803
- Why?
- Yeah.

17:49.836 --> 17:52.806
This is... No, not
a good look for us.

17:55.308 --> 17:57.811
I mean, I'm not your
CI anymore, right?

17:57.844 --> 17:59.479
So...

17:59.512 --> 18:00.847
No, no, you're
right. You're not.

18:01.080 --> 18:04.117
You're not, but it's the suits.

18:04.150 --> 18:06.219
- They're not gonna get it.
- The suits?

18:06.252 --> 18:07.687
- Yeah.
- Okay.

18:09.289 --> 18:10.390
Hey, look at me.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.192
Look at me. No, no,
no, don't do that.

18:12.225 --> 18:13.226
Don't.

18:14.394 --> 18:17.197
I'm not mad at you, okay?

18:17.230 --> 18:18.631
We just got to be
a bit more careful.

18:20.266 --> 18:21.267
Okay.

18:22.435 --> 18:23.603
- I'll see you later.
- Yep.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.341
- Okay.
- Hey, hey.

18:28.374 --> 18:29.375
Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no.

18:29.409 --> 18:31.377
No, go that way, make a left.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.829
Come on, man, pick up,
pick up, pick up, pick up.

18:49.863 --> 18:52.131
Yo, Junior, where you
at? We got to talk.

18:53.533 --> 18:54.534
Fuck, man.

19:45.318 --> 19:46.319
Hello?

19:47.520 --> 19:48.521
Hey.

19:49.355 --> 19:50.356
"Hey"?

19:50.957 --> 19:53.493
Is that all you have to say?
Where the fuck have you been?

19:53.526 --> 19:54.527
Why haven't you called?

19:54.561 --> 19:57.964
I'm sorry. My phone
wasn't charged.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.732
You're so full of shit.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.403
You know what? You're right.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.707
You're too smart for me, D.

20:08.975 --> 20:10.543
Always were.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.278
Junior, where are
you? What's going on?

20:14.948 --> 20:15.949
I tried.

20:17.417 --> 20:18.651
I tried. I want
you to know that.

20:18.685 --> 20:20.587
Tried what? I don't understand.

20:20.620 --> 20:24.657
To be better, but
I'm a piece of shit.

20:26.392 --> 20:27.860
You're using again, aren't you?

20:27.894 --> 20:31.331
I fucked up.
I fucked up real bad, you know?

20:32.632 --> 20:33.766
There's no going back.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.669
Okay, what did you
do? Just tell me.

20:36.703 --> 20:38.705
No, you don't need to know that.

20:38.738 --> 20:39.906
I can do that much for you.

20:40.773 --> 20:41.774
Don't do this.

20:43.443 --> 20:45.445
Whatever it is,
we'll figure it out.

20:45.478 --> 20:47.380
- You're a good person.
- No, I'm not.

20:54.621 --> 20:56.322
You give Mackayleigh
a kiss for me.

21:00.326 --> 21:02.495
So what, you're just
a fucking deadbeat now?

21:03.930 --> 21:05.365
You're just gonna walk away?

21:06.866 --> 21:08.735
For what? Huh?

21:08.768 --> 21:09.902
So you can go get high?

21:09.936 --> 21:11.838
'Cause I'm a fucking
killer, okay?

21:13.539 --> 21:15.341
You need to leave
me the fuck alone.

21:23.516 --> 21:24.651
Oh, my...

22:20.573 --> 22:21.908
Yeah, you're good.

22:26.079 --> 22:27.080
Jesus.

22:28.915 --> 22:30.049
Who the fuck are you?

22:30.083 --> 22:33.086
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, baby girl,
it's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

22:33.119 --> 22:34.654
Our bad.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.456
Didn't mean to scare you.

22:36.489 --> 22:37.490
Junior here?

22:37.924 --> 22:39.892
- No.
- I've been looking for him.

22:39.926 --> 22:41.127
He's not here.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.628
Mind if I take a look?

22:42.662 --> 22:44.063
Yeah, I mind.

22:45.898 --> 22:47.500
Hey, excuse me, what the fuck?

22:47.533 --> 22:49.969
Hey, girl, don't worry yourself.

22:50.002 --> 22:51.437
Just gonna be a minute.

22:55.007 --> 22:56.843
That's a cute baby.

23:00.480 --> 23:01.781
Got those fat little cheeks.

23:01.814 --> 23:03.449
How much she weigh
when she was born?

23:04.917 --> 23:06.119
What?

23:07.153 --> 23:09.522
I mean, she blow it out or what?

23:12.558 --> 23:15.828
See, when my girl had our baby,

23:15.862 --> 23:19.165
I told the doc,
"Throw in a couple extra
stitches.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.467
Keep it tight."

23:21.501 --> 23:25.638
Just wondering
if Junior thought of that,
stupid fuck.

23:29.475 --> 23:30.843
You a fucking perv?

23:32.044 --> 23:33.112
Is that your thing?

23:34.814 --> 23:38.117
You talk about my pussy again,
I'll shove my foot up your ass.

23:38.151 --> 23:40.953
- He's not here.
- Hey, you a perv, too?

23:40.987 --> 23:43.923
Is that how you roll?
Yeah, I'll fuck you up, too.

23:43.956 --> 23:46.092
I got the whole Portuguese mafia
at my fucking back.

23:46.125 --> 23:48.828
You don't even want to test me,
motherfucker.

23:49.829 --> 23:51.831
Hey, it's all good, Donna.

23:53.966 --> 23:56.435
- We're leaving.
- Yeah, you better.

23:56.469 --> 23:57.837
Get the fuck out of here!

24:00.673 --> 24:01.674
Fucking cunt.

24:01.707 --> 24:03.109
Dude, shut the fuck up.

24:04.210 --> 24:05.211
Hey, baby girl.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.580
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Come
here. Come here. Come here.

24:08.514 --> 24:09.582
You're okay.

24:14.020 --> 24:15.188
Some fucking bullshit.

24:16.656 --> 24:17.657
What?

24:18.958 --> 24:20.159
We're already killing
the motherfucker.

24:20.193 --> 24:22.461
There's no need to mess
with his old lady, too.

24:22.495 --> 24:23.963
That's some psycho shit.

24:23.996 --> 24:27.834
Nah, that's some soldier shit,
raping and looting.

24:27.867 --> 24:29.702
Thugs got to have a code.

24:30.236 --> 24:34.106
Yeah? What's yours,
leave no burger uneaten?

24:34.140 --> 24:35.141
Hey.

24:35.174 --> 24:37.109
You got jokes, motherfucker?

24:37.143 --> 24:39.145
My code is, an order's an order.

24:40.746 --> 24:43.082
I get my orders from Frankie.
You get your orders from me.

24:44.250 --> 24:48.020
And right now your order is to
sit your ass in that car and
shut the fuck up.

24:50.256 --> 24:51.891
Whatever, dude.

24:53.826 --> 24:54.827
Give me a reason.

25:01.133 --> 25:02.134
You good?

25:03.536 --> 25:04.537
Yeah, I'm good.

25:10.676 --> 25:11.777
Let's move.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.186
Hi, there.

25:20.219 --> 25:22.054
Can I offer you a private dance?

25:22.088 --> 25:23.522
I'm good.

25:27.693 --> 25:29.195
Cheap-ass motherfucker.

25:30.196 --> 25:31.197
What?

25:33.766 --> 25:35.001
Nothing.

25:40.006 --> 25:41.207
All right.

25:42.308 --> 25:43.709
There's this guy.

25:46.946 --> 25:48.714
Thought it was
different, you know.

25:49.749 --> 25:51.150
Turns out, he's
just another trick.

25:52.318 --> 25:53.986
Well, at least you know now.

25:54.020 --> 25:55.021
Yeah.

25:57.590 --> 25:59.926
How long you been working here?

25:59.959 --> 26:01.093
Too long.

26:02.261 --> 26:07.099
Then you should know men
are only good for two things...

26:07.133 --> 26:09.669
money and dick.

26:09.702 --> 26:12.138
You catch feelings,
that's on you.

26:19.078 --> 26:20.079
Yeah.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.822
Hey, Donna, it's me, Jackie!

26:35.127 --> 26:36.696
Hey, I'm looking for Junior.

26:39.231 --> 26:41.167
Called about an
hour ago, all crazy.

26:44.103 --> 26:46.005
He's been doing that shit
since high school, you know.

26:48.341 --> 26:50.343
I'm the asshole
that keeps taking him back.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.847
- You think he's using?
- What do you think?

26:59.251 --> 27:01.087
Kept saying he was no good.

27:01.988 --> 27:03.956
He's a killer and
all this other shit.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.693
Then these two dudes
came looking for him.

27:08.761 --> 27:09.762
Who?

27:09.795 --> 27:11.397
Some fat black dude and this...

27:13.366 --> 27:14.700
...dumbass white kid.

27:17.837 --> 27:19.038
You know where Junior's at?

27:22.141 --> 27:25.044
He didn't say, but the idiot
doesn't know about the Find My
Friends app.

27:28.247 --> 27:29.949
He's at the Captain Walker.

27:32.318 --> 27:34.320
All right, I think maybe
I should go talk to him,

27:34.353 --> 27:36.255
make sure he's good, you know?

27:36.288 --> 27:38.891
I'll tell him to give you a
call, but I think I should go
alone.

27:40.726 --> 27:42.395
You think I want to
see him like that?

27:46.932 --> 27:49.902
Besides, I promised myself
I'd never let her see him fucked
up.

27:54.440 --> 27:57.243
Donna, you should know
that everything that Junior
did...

27:58.210 --> 28:01.947
...getting sober, trying to make
money, going to AA...

28:04.250 --> 28:05.418
...he did that for you.

28:12.858 --> 28:14.260
I know you're trying to be nice.

28:16.695 --> 28:19.265
But all that means is that I'm
the one who wasn't enough for
him.

28:24.336 --> 28:28.040
I love him, but I wish...

28:32.912 --> 28:34.213
I just can't, you know?

28:42.755 --> 28:43.756
I know.

29:04.210 --> 29:06.045
Hey! You don't need to clean.
Look, I'm cool.

29:06.078 --> 29:08.147
- We're good.
- Should have put your sign out.

29:23.062 --> 29:25.131
Why you taking me to a fag bar?

29:25.164 --> 29:27.199
'Cause he pumps out
of here sometimes.

29:27.233 --> 29:28.234
Damn.

29:29.168 --> 29:31.303
Gay dudes be straight fucking.

29:31.337 --> 29:33.973
I mean, even the fat ones
be getting it in.

29:34.006 --> 29:35.007
No offense.

29:35.841 --> 29:37.476
Frankie wants this done today.

29:37.510 --> 29:39.512
You're the one didn't keep tabs
on your boy.

29:40.846 --> 29:41.847
Let me get a Stella.

29:41.881 --> 29:43.082
Hey, this is him. Let's go.

29:43.115 --> 29:44.550
I didn't get my beer.

29:44.783 --> 29:45.918
Man, shut the fuck up.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.320
Hey, what's going on, man?

29:49.488 --> 29:51.557
Yeah, I can bring
something over to you.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.192
Yeah, we over by
that way anyway.

29:54.326 --> 29:56.862
Yeah, me and Kizzle be there
in 10 minutes.

29:56.896 --> 29:58.864
Cool. See you soon, J.

29:58.898 --> 30:00.499
Let's go.

30:00.533 --> 30:01.534
Hey.

30:02.201 --> 30:03.402
Oh, my God.

30:20.886 --> 30:22.188
Hey.

30:22.221 --> 30:23.889
Looking for Junior McCarthy.

30:30.429 --> 30:32.064
- Jackie?
- We need to talk.

30:36.235 --> 30:38.537
Dude, I already know
you're fucked up, okay?

30:38.571 --> 30:40.306
Whatever. It is what it is.

30:40.339 --> 30:41.974
Jesus, you look like shit.

30:42.007 --> 30:44.410
Yeah, I know, right? Want one?

30:59.491 --> 31:02.027
I know about Sherry
Henry, Junior.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.164
I know you dumped the body.

31:07.066 --> 31:08.968
I checked the marine logs
for the Jack and Bobby.

31:09.001 --> 31:10.102
You took it out that night.

31:12.004 --> 31:14.106
Junior, I can't help you
if you don't talk to me.

31:14.139 --> 31:17.443
I don't want your help.
I'm not saying shit.

31:17.476 --> 31:18.978
Door's right there.
Don't let it hit you in the ass.

31:19.011 --> 31:20.012
What, so this is
who you are now?

31:20.045 --> 31:22.147
Some fucking degenerate criminal
shooting up in a motel room?

31:22.181 --> 31:23.515
- Yeah.
- Is that it?

31:23.549 --> 31:25.050
Yeah, it's who I've always been.
You just didn't know it.

31:25.084 --> 31:26.418
You've been lying this
whole fucking time.

31:26.452 --> 31:28.053
What about Krista, huh?

31:28.087 --> 31:29.488
Was it you? Did you kill her?

31:29.521 --> 31:30.556
You kill Krista?

31:30.589 --> 31:32.424
Whatever, I don't have time
for your fucking bullshit today.

31:33.425 --> 31:35.327
- What...
- Yo, J.

31:35.361 --> 31:37.162
- Yeah, you got to go now, Jack.
- Who is it?

31:37.196 --> 31:38.330
Don't worry about it.
Just get the fuck out of here.

31:38.364 --> 31:40.466
No, fuck you. I'm not going
anywhere till you talk to me.

31:40.499 --> 31:41.667
Just chill in the
bathroom or something.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.269
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Well, just get in the fucking
bathroom.

31:43.302 --> 31:44.436
- Fuck off, Junior. No.

31:44.470 --> 31:46.405
Listen to me, these dudes
will kill you, okay?

31:47.673 --> 31:51.043
They find out you're the girl
asking questions, they will
fucking kill you.

31:52.378 --> 31:54.346
So you need to shut the fuck up
and get the fuck out.

31:54.380 --> 31:55.381
Do you understand?

32:05.491 --> 32:07.293
Yo, what up, O? Kizzle.

32:09.995 --> 32:12.164
What the fuck
happened to your face?

32:17.002 --> 32:18.203
Who's the girl?

32:18.237 --> 32:19.471
That's my side piece.

32:19.505 --> 32:21.540
She don't like it
when I call her that, though.

32:21.573 --> 32:23.142
She was just leaving,
weren't you, ho?

32:29.448 --> 32:32.251
Hey, I'll hit you up next time
I want you to suck that D, all
right?

32:32.284 --> 32:33.952
#MeToo.

32:44.997 --> 32:45.998
Get your shit.

32:47.433 --> 32:48.434
We got to take a ride.

32:53.639 --> 32:54.673
Let's go.

33:34.079 --> 33:35.647
- Abruzzo.
- Hey, I need to talk to you.

33:36.281 --> 33:37.549
It's not a good time right now.

33:38.250 --> 33:39.418
I need help, Ray.

33:41.787 --> 33:43.789
- Okay, what's going on?
- I have information.

33:45.090 --> 33:46.525
I know who dumped Sherry Henry.

33:49.428 --> 33:51.630
Who? Hey, who?
Tell me right now.

33:51.663 --> 33:53.665
No. Meet me at the jetty
where I found her.

34:05.778 --> 34:07.146
Where we going?

34:07.780 --> 34:09.581
Got to make a stop.

34:09.615 --> 34:10.616
Won't take long.

34:11.784 --> 34:12.785
Here.

34:16.522 --> 34:17.656
Thanks.

34:17.689 --> 34:19.458
Yeah, so don't say we never did
nothing for you.

34:53.091 --> 34:54.092
Here we are again.

34:56.261 --> 34:57.296
What's up, Jackie?

34:58.697 --> 35:00.165
You got me all the way out here.

35:01.433 --> 35:02.835
I want some guarantees.

35:02.868 --> 35:04.636
I want you to promise me
you're gonna take care of him.

35:04.670 --> 35:06.138
No, it doesn't work that way.

35:06.171 --> 35:07.606
You got to give
me the name first.

35:11.343 --> 35:12.411
Junior McCarthy.

35:13.412 --> 35:15.747
His father's a fisherman, owns a
trawler, Jack and Bobby II.

35:15.781 --> 35:17.749
Went from P-Town to Truro
the night Sherry Henry died.

35:17.783 --> 35:19.117
He went to Truro?

35:19.151 --> 35:21.386
Yeah, he was trying to keep it
on the DL and not record it,

35:21.420 --> 35:24.156
but there's a transponder
on every fishing boat you can't
fuck with.

35:24.189 --> 35:25.290
I printed out the logs.

35:27.759 --> 35:28.894
Is this your guy, Junior?

35:30.429 --> 35:31.697
Yeah.

35:31.730 --> 35:33.298
Yeah, you know him?

35:33.799 --> 35:35.901
This photo was taken the night
Krista Collins was killed.

35:36.134 --> 35:39.538
That guy driving,
that's Frankie's lieutenant,
Osito.

35:39.571 --> 35:41.173
We're thinking they killed her.

35:42.407 --> 35:43.408
Jesus.

35:44.710 --> 35:47.513
He's with that guy right now
and this other dude named
Kizzle.

35:47.546 --> 35:48.614
They were just here.
They picked him up.

35:48.647 --> 35:49.915
- Right fucking now?
- Yeah.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.683
- On foot or in a car?
- In a car.

35:51.717 --> 35:52.818
In a gray 4Runner.

35:52.851 --> 35:56.655
License plate, 61T... 67T1G7.

35:56.688 --> 35:57.789
- Saintille.
- Hey, buddy, it's me.

35:57.823 --> 35:59.458
I need a BOLO on a gray 4Runner,

35:59.491 --> 36:00.659
- license plate...
- Six, seven...

36:00.692 --> 36:01.894
- T one...
- Tango one...

36:01.927 --> 36:03.395
- G seven.
- Golf seven.

36:03.428 --> 36:05.197
All right. What's up?

36:05.230 --> 36:07.633
Our white boy's in a car
with Osito and Kizzle.

36:07.666 --> 36:08.834
Think it's going down right now?

36:08.867 --> 36:09.868
It could be.

36:09.902 --> 36:11.470
I mean, if you're Osito,
where you want to do this?

36:11.503 --> 36:14.873
Somewhere controlled,
not like Krista Collins.

36:14.907 --> 36:15.941
O'Donnell's.

36:16.174 --> 36:17.476
Well, that's a long shot.

36:18.544 --> 36:20.512
Someone did jack the pole cam
there this morning, though.

36:20.546 --> 36:21.580
Man, you've seen that place.

36:21.613 --> 36:23.215
There's, like, 20 different ways
to kill a dude.

36:23.248 --> 36:24.483
It's worth a shot.

36:24.516 --> 36:25.851
Yeah, fuck it. Meet me there.

36:27.419 --> 36:29.288
Hey, Jack, look, I'm
not gonna lie to you.

36:29.321 --> 36:30.656
Your friend's in real
danger right now.

36:30.689 --> 36:32.291
But you did the right
thing by calling me,

36:32.324 --> 36:34.426
and I promise you,
I'm gonna do everything I can to
find him

36:34.459 --> 36:35.527
before anything happens, okay?

36:35.561 --> 36:36.962
Wait. No, no, no. No,
it's not like that.

36:37.195 --> 36:38.397
I called you as a law
enforcement officer.

36:38.430 --> 36:39.798
I gave you information.
I need to be a part of this.

36:39.831 --> 36:41.466
What do you mean
"it's not like that"?

36:41.500 --> 36:43.602
This isn't cops and robbers.
I got two dead bodies already.

36:43.635 --> 36:44.937
You think I don't know that?

36:44.970 --> 36:46.405
Krista Collins
called me for help,

36:46.438 --> 36:47.906
and it turns out
that I know the guy who killed
her.

36:47.940 --> 36:49.741
That's on me.

36:49.775 --> 36:51.977
Fuck it, the whole thing is on
me, but it's mine, all right?

36:52.210 --> 36:53.312
It's all I got.

36:54.780 --> 36:55.781
Please.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.654
They give you a piece in case
you got to shoot a whale or
something?

37:08.293 --> 37:09.795
Yeah, let's go.

37:18.503 --> 37:19.671
Hey, listen up.

37:19.705 --> 37:21.773
You have to deal with your own
agency if something goes bad in
there.

37:21.807 --> 37:24.343
You understand? We're State
Police. We're not responsible
for you.

37:24.376 --> 37:26.511
Okay, yeah, yeah.
I don't give a shit about that.
Let's go.

37:31.950 --> 37:33.251
You guys ready?

37:33.285 --> 37:34.319
Yeah.

37:38.890 --> 37:40.258
Hey, Javier!

37:40.292 --> 37:41.793
Good to see you again, man.

37:41.827 --> 37:43.362
Brought your friends.

37:43.395 --> 37:44.630
Get that warrant yet?

37:44.663 --> 37:46.665
Probable cause, motherfucker.
Get in there!

37:46.698 --> 37:48.433
- Hey, hey, hey. Let me see your
hands. - Get the fuck back.

37:48.467 --> 37:49.801
Let me see your
fucking hands, man.

37:49.835 --> 37:51.670
Osito? Osito?

38:11.857 --> 38:13.492
Fuck. Where the fuck is he?

38:13.525 --> 38:15.494
No Osito here.

38:15.527 --> 38:16.762
Where the fuck is Junior?

38:47.693 --> 38:50.362
- Come on.
- What?

38:50.395 --> 38:51.697
What you mean "what?" Let's go.

39:03.742 --> 39:04.876
Where we going?

39:04.910 --> 39:06.878
We got to drop a
thing off for a guy.

39:06.912 --> 39:08.413
When'd you get so mouthy?

39:17.622 --> 39:20.726
Spot's right through here,
just two more minutes.

39:20.759 --> 39:21.960
- Dude.
- What?

39:21.993 --> 39:23.662
- Can you walk any fucking
faster? - Yeah, yeah.

39:23.695 --> 39:25.397
- Kizz, chill.
- Me fucking chill?

39:25.430 --> 39:27.733
I'm not the fucking junkie who's
fucked up every fucking job he's
ever been given.

39:27.766 --> 39:29.801
I said, shut the fuck up.

39:29.835 --> 39:32.370
Fuck this. Soft P
-Town motherfucker.

39:33.672 --> 39:35.407
- Fuck it. Fuck it.
- Jesus.

39:35.440 --> 39:37.476
- What the fuck, man?
- We're not dealing with faggots
anymore!

39:37.509 --> 39:38.810
Jesus, man, Osito.
What's going on, man?

39:40.679 --> 39:41.780
You talk to the cops yet?

39:41.813 --> 39:42.914
What? No.

39:42.948 --> 39:44.750
No, fuck that. You
fucking kidding me?

39:44.783 --> 39:47.152
Nobody asked me shit, and if
they did, I'd slap 'em with my
nut sack,

39:47.385 --> 39:48.386
'cause I'm a fucking soldier.

39:48.420 --> 39:49.721
You know that, right?

39:51.857 --> 39:53.558
Dude, don't do...
Osito, you ain't got to do
this...

39:53.592 --> 39:56.094
- Shut the fuck up, pussy!
- Okay! All right!

39:56.128 --> 39:57.462
Okay.

39:57.496 --> 39:59.498
You know what?
Your body's never gonna pop.

40:01.533 --> 40:03.068
Now count to three.

40:04.436 --> 40:05.437
- Come on.
- Count to three.

40:05.470 --> 40:06.938
No. No, man, please.

40:06.972 --> 40:07.973
Come on, dude. You fucking...

40:08.006 --> 40:09.741
I said, fucking count to three!

40:11.576 --> 40:13.111
Fine! I'll fucking do it!

40:13.145 --> 40:14.813
- One...
- I got a daughter, man.

40:14.846 --> 40:15.847
Two...

40:18.817 --> 40:20.152
Fuck!

40:21.720 --> 40:22.721
Fuck!

40:23.789 --> 40:25.824
Told you to give me
a reason, motherfucker.

40:29.961 --> 40:32.931
- Get up.
- No, no. No, man.

40:33.665 --> 40:34.966
Man, get the fuck up!

40:35.834 --> 40:37.836
I got an ax and two shovels
in the back of the car.

40:37.869 --> 40:39.971
All right? We got to
do this right away.

40:40.005 --> 40:42.707
Head and hands, all
right? Bury the rest.

40:42.741 --> 40:43.942
Go.

40:44.843 --> 40:45.844
Run!

40:55.520 --> 40:56.521
Hey, Wayne.

40:57.522 --> 40:58.523
I need a favor.

41:03.995 --> 41:06.498
Fuck it. That's good enough.

41:14.172 --> 41:15.674
You know what we got
to do now, right?

41:17.042 --> 41:18.476
- Yeah.

41:18.510 --> 41:19.711
- Fuck it, give me a toot, man.

41:19.744 --> 41:21.046
Take one for yourself.

41:37.229 --> 41:38.730
Here, give me that.

41:43.268 --> 41:44.636
You good?

41:44.669 --> 41:45.670
Yeah.

41:48.573 --> 41:49.875
Really, bro?

41:49.908 --> 41:50.909
Yeah.

42:28.179 --> 42:30.015
All right.

42:30.048 --> 42:31.583
Stick that shit in the backpack.

42:32.751 --> 42:35.553
Come help me bury his ass.

42:35.587 --> 42:36.955
Bury that bloody hoodie
while you at it, too.

43:10.689 --> 43:12.290
Better throw your phone in, too.

43:12.324 --> 43:13.325
Okay, yeah.

43:18.129 --> 43:21.800
Just so we're clear, if Kizzle
pops, I'm dead, too, same as
your ass.

43:22.934 --> 43:25.170
So, as far as Frankie knows,
you're dead and gone.

43:25.837 --> 43:27.339
Okay, I understand.

43:30.308 --> 43:31.309
Can I ask you a question?

43:32.944 --> 43:34.279
Why'd you do that for me?

43:36.648 --> 43:38.650
Because fuck Frankie.

43:38.683 --> 43:40.085
I'm the one out here doing it.

43:41.186 --> 43:44.189
And fuck Kizzle, too,
degenerate motherfucker.

43:47.692 --> 43:49.294
Man's got to have a code.

43:53.264 --> 43:54.966
Wayne send you?

43:56.634 --> 43:58.236
Give it to me.

44:04.409 --> 44:06.177
All right, let's go.

44:17.922 --> 44:20.792
- What the fuck are we doing?
- Taking you back to your
office.

44:20.825 --> 44:22.660
What the fuck, man?
You're just gonna give up like
that?

44:22.694 --> 44:24.062
What do you mean, "What the
fuck?" I'm not giving up.

44:24.095 --> 44:26.264
- There's nothing left for you
to do. - That's bullshit.

44:26.297 --> 44:30.301
Look, if you got any other great
ideas of where he might be, I'm
fucking open.

44:32.904 --> 44:34.406
Huh? Nothing?

44:35.407 --> 44:36.741
Fuck.

44:36.775 --> 44:37.809
Alan, talk to me.

44:39.144 --> 44:40.845
Are you fucking kidding me?
I'm five minutes away.

44:41.913 --> 44:42.947
I'm gonna meet you there.

44:43.982 --> 44:45.417
- What?
- BOLO just came back.

44:45.450 --> 44:47.118
They found Osito's
car in Bourne.

44:47.152 --> 44:49.254
- We going there now?
- Right fucking now.

45:04.369 --> 45:06.237
There it is. Let's go.

45:06.271 --> 45:07.839
We should wait for Alan.

45:07.872 --> 45:09.240
Oh, maybe we should
wait for Alan.

45:09.274 --> 45:11.209
Come on, man.
Junior might be in there. Let's
go.

45:11.242 --> 45:13.178
You're fucking unbelievable,
you know that?

45:13.211 --> 45:14.946
You're like a dog with a bone.

45:27.025 --> 45:28.026
Hi.

45:29.961 --> 45:31.763
Hey, we're looking
for the owner of that 4Runner.

45:31.796 --> 45:34.265
Number five, he just got home.

45:34.299 --> 45:35.300
Oh, yeah?

45:36.835 --> 45:39.104
Why don't you guys
go inside? Okay?

45:40.438 --> 45:41.940
I didn't do nothing.

45:46.010 --> 45:47.479
I'm not saying nothing.

45:48.880 --> 45:52.417
- Are you gonna make me some
food? - Make yourself food.

46:21.212 --> 46:22.213
Hey, hey, hey.

46:23.915 --> 46:25.884
Who else is here? Who
else is fucking in here?

46:28.019 --> 46:29.854
Upstairs bedroom.

46:40.031 --> 46:41.132
Hands up! State Police!

46:41.166 --> 46:43.134
State Police, put your fucking
hands up right now!

46:43.168 --> 46:45.837
Get up! Do not
move! Do not move!

46:45.870 --> 46:46.971
Don't you fucking move, man!

46:47.005 --> 46:48.139
Don't shoot!

46:49.240 --> 46:51.176
That ticket has you switching
buses in New York.

46:52.544 --> 46:54.145
Cousin gonna pick
you up in Miami.

46:54.913 --> 46:56.281
Never been to Miami.

46:56.314 --> 46:58.416
Miami's the shit, man.

46:58.449 --> 47:01.519
They have females,
tropical breezes.

47:01.553 --> 47:03.922
Shit, niggas be
popping off down there.

47:05.256 --> 47:07.225
Gonna get in all that shit.

47:07.258 --> 47:09.194
Yeah, yeah, maybe
I'll get, like,

47:09.227 --> 47:12.197
those grills on my teeth,
cornrows, like that movie.

47:12.230 --> 47:13.531
Man, shut the fuck up.

47:15.300 --> 47:16.301
But, hey...

47:17.202 --> 47:18.970
...my cousin don't
fuck with no junkies.

47:20.271 --> 47:21.506
Yeah. I hear you.

47:21.539 --> 47:22.907
Nah. Look at me.

47:24.175 --> 47:25.176
Look at me.

47:26.177 --> 47:27.579
This ends now.

47:27.612 --> 47:28.980
All right? For me, too.

47:30.848 --> 47:31.849
Okay.

47:33.251 --> 47:34.586
Okay. Yeah, I promise.

47:35.486 --> 47:36.955
I mean, I don't know
what happened to me today.

47:36.988 --> 47:38.089
I was...

47:38.122 --> 47:39.257
I was weak.

47:40.091 --> 47:41.559
Won't happen again.

47:44.429 --> 47:46.264
Hey, you gave me
my life today, bro.

47:48.066 --> 47:49.067
I won't let you down.

47:49.100 --> 47:50.602
I'm gonna make something
of myself down there, dude.

47:50.635 --> 47:51.636
All better. I promise.

47:56.274 --> 47:57.275
Yeah.

48:00.044 --> 48:01.279
All right, well...

48:02.113 --> 48:05.250
...here's a little something
to help you out till you get on
your feet.

48:05.283 --> 48:07.452
A few grand till you
get started working.

48:07.485 --> 48:08.653
Fuck.

48:08.886 --> 48:11.055
Messed up with my
girl today, bro.

48:11.089 --> 48:13.258
Yeah? So?

48:13.291 --> 48:15.994
She took your ass back before.
She'll do it again.

48:16.961 --> 48:19.998
Shit, maybe after a while,
you can send for her.

48:21.299 --> 48:24.602
Hey, but for right now,
you got to stay gone.

48:25.970 --> 48:27.105
Okay. Yeah. What about you?

48:27.939 --> 48:29.607
Long as you stay away,
I'll be all right.

48:30.541 --> 48:33.244
Tell Frankie Kizzle
never showed up.

48:33.278 --> 48:35.313
Probably stuck his dick
in the wrong pussy,

48:35.346 --> 48:37.448
got shot up by some
bitch's boyfriend.

48:39.017 --> 48:40.118
Shit.

48:40.151 --> 48:42.520
Maybe I might go down
to the DR for a while,

48:42.553 --> 48:45.156
lay low, just in case.

48:47.258 --> 48:48.926
Soldiers, right?

48:48.960 --> 48:49.961
That's right.

48:52.664 --> 48:57.001
Hey, man, it's like you said,
just got to keep pumping, you
know?

48:57.035 --> 48:59.370
One day, you wake up
thinking about breakfast and
shit, right?

49:01.005 --> 49:02.073
Yep.

49:06.611 --> 49:08.680
All right, go to Dibby's,
grab an egg and cheese for the
road.

49:08.713 --> 49:10.081
You want something?

49:10.114 --> 49:11.115
Nah.

49:12.116 --> 49:13.117
I'm straight.

49:15.620 --> 49:17.021
Thanks, brother.

49:36.507 --> 49:39.043
Enough dicking around, man.
Tell us where you got the car.

49:40.978 --> 49:41.979
El coche.

49:43.681 --> 49:45.750
You know what? Fuck
this shit, man.

49:45.983 --> 49:47.118
You want to see
your kid being born?

49:50.755 --> 49:52.390
Nothing?

49:52.423 --> 49:54.225
Okay. It's your funeral, amigo.

49:55.159 --> 49:56.361
Guess what.

49:56.394 --> 49:58.563
Immigration and
Customs Enforcement.

49:58.596 --> 50:00.765
- Let me talk to Agent Harley.
- What the hell? You're calling
ICE?

50:00.998 --> 50:02.066
That is so fucked up.

50:02.100 --> 50:03.701
That's great. She's woke.

50:03.735 --> 50:05.303
You cool with the fact
that he's calling ICE right now?

50:05.336 --> 50:07.004
Man, cool or not
cool, it don't matter.

50:07.038 --> 50:08.639
I'm asking what you
think as a person.

50:08.673 --> 50:10.408
I'm not a person. I'm a cop.

50:12.610 --> 50:13.778
Besides, he's bluffing.

50:14.011 --> 50:16.147
No ICE in Cape Cod.

50:19.450 --> 50:21.519
Can I maybe talk to
him for a minute?

50:24.055 --> 50:25.056
Do your thing.

50:28.459 --> 50:29.727
Hi, my name is Jackie.

50:30.728 --> 50:33.030
You from the Dominican?

50:38.269 --> 50:40.338
My mom is from Barahona.

50:40.805 --> 50:42.340
You know it?

50:43.674 --> 50:45.176
I'm from El Manguito.

50:45.510 --> 50:46.677
Near the lake?

50:47.745 --> 50:49.046
- Sí.
- Sí.

50:50.114 --> 50:51.115
Look...

50:51.749 --> 50:54.719
That goofy-ass gringo,
he wants to be a dick.

50:54.786 --> 50:56.654
But I'm not gonna let him.

50:58.156 --> 51:02.093
I can help you.
But you gotta help me first.

51:03.628 --> 51:06.697
Your other option
is he calls immigration.

51:07.198 --> 51:10.835
And you go back to the
Dominican Republic real soon.

51:13.771 --> 51:16.207
Are you in charge here?

51:17.208 --> 51:18.810
Ray, am I in charge here?

51:18.843 --> 51:20.578
Yeah, you're the boss.

51:29.420 --> 51:34.225
A friend of a friend told me to meet
a guyand a bring him some stuff.

51:34.759 --> 51:36.794
And he wanted to trade cars.

51:36.861 --> 51:39.263
And his car was better than mine.

51:39.330 --> 51:40.498
And so...

51:41.265 --> 51:42.633
You know.

51:43.201 --> 51:44.435
And what did you bring him?

51:46.437 --> 51:47.605
Money.

51:47.672 --> 51:49.540
And a bus ticket.

51:49.607 --> 51:50.575
A bus ticket?

51:50.641 --> 51:52.310
To where?

51:52.376 --> 51:53.744
Miami.

51:56.447 --> 51:57.882
I know where they are.

52:09.193 --> 52:11.863
We got a bus heading west on I
-95 just past 18.

52:11.896 --> 52:13.297
Request to pull over.

52:13.331 --> 52:14.332
That's a negative.

52:14.365 --> 52:17.201
I want you to stage at the next
stop, and we'll get 'em there.

52:17.235 --> 52:18.436
So what happens when we get him?

52:18.469 --> 52:19.804
You want Junior
to testify against Frankie?

52:19.837 --> 52:21.539
From your lips to God's ears.

52:21.572 --> 52:23.207
Is that safe for him?

52:23.241 --> 52:24.642
He gives me Frankie Cuevas,

52:24.675 --> 52:27.545
I will wrap his ass in Bubble
Wrap and let him sleep on my
fucking couch.

52:27.578 --> 52:29.180
You always this intense
about everything?

52:29.213 --> 52:30.815
Me? Intense? What about you?

52:42.360 --> 52:43.528
Sherry Henry?

52:44.795 --> 52:45.897
She was my CI.

52:48.165 --> 52:49.800
I promised I'd keep her safe.

52:51.903 --> 52:53.771
Obviously I didn't do that.

53:01.412 --> 53:02.513
There it is.

53:03.247 --> 53:05.416
Sergeant Abruzzo here.
I got eyes on the bus.

53:46.624 --> 53:48.292
Fuck. I don't see him.

53:52.229 --> 53:53.798
All right, guys,
let's take the bus.

54:09.680 --> 54:11.682
Hey, you three troopers,
you're with us.

54:11.716 --> 54:13.317
- Got it.
- All right.

54:16.621 --> 54:17.655
You good?

54:18.489 --> 54:19.657
Let's find your boy.

54:57.361 --> 54:58.429
Junior, you in there?

55:04.368 --> 55:06.337
Who the fuck is this kid?

55:06.370 --> 55:07.972
Fucking Houdini?

55:08.005 --> 55:09.006
Let's go.
