12:14.995 --> 12:17.171
Stop. Okay? We need
to figure out how

12:17.345 --> 12:18.781
we're gonna get that phone.I'm telling you,

12:18.955 --> 12:21.218
she doesn't let it
out of her sight.

12:21.349 --> 12:22.785
We're gonna have to pry it
out of her cold dead hands.

12:26.484 --> 12:27.921
You are not killing her.

12:28.095 --> 12:29.923
I'm not suggesting
that, you psycho.

12:30.097 --> 12:32.229
[Lesley exhales]We need to get her
in, like, a...

12:32.403 --> 12:34.362
like a death-like state.What?

12:34.536 --> 12:36.364
Like, drug her?

12:36.494 --> 12:39.062
Huh. Not a terrible plan.

12:39.236 --> 12:40.281
How is that not
a terrible plan?

12:40.455 --> 12:41.412
You have another one?

12:41.586 --> 12:43.414
That is how.

12:43.588 --> 12:45.155
Don't you have sleeping pills?

12:45.286 --> 12:46.809
Yeah, but I have no idea
what the balance is

12:46.940 --> 12:48.376
of giving her enough
that she passes out,

12:48.506 --> 12:50.160
but not so much
that it kills her.

12:50.291 --> 12:52.728
I'm not risking that
because I don't kill people.

12:52.859 --> 12:54.382
Well, la-de-da.

12:54.512 --> 12:55.731
Sleeping pills wouldn't
work anyway.

12:55.862 --> 12:57.472
If she woke up...[Lesley sighs]

12:57.646 --> 12:59.387
Some jackass
roofied me once.

12:59.561 --> 13:02.085
What?Yeah.

13:02.259 --> 13:05.045
It was fine. I mean, Jess--
she noticed and took me home,

13:05.219 --> 13:06.873
but I don't remember anything.

13:07.047 --> 13:08.788
And I was out
for, like, hours.

13:08.962 --> 13:11.268
I mean, I guess
roofies are designed

13:11.442 --> 13:13.444
for exactly
what we need--

13:13.618 --> 13:16.665
knock someone out fast and have
them not remember what happened.

13:16.839 --> 13:18.885
Right. So, we just need
to figure out

13:19.059 --> 13:20.016
how to get our hands on some.

13:24.281 --> 13:25.805
Why are you guys looking at me?

13:25.979 --> 13:27.676
I don't have roofies.

13:27.850 --> 13:29.634
Sorry. Excuse me for assuming

13:29.765 --> 13:31.680
that the former drug dealer
might know how to get drugs.

13:31.854 --> 13:34.030
Uh, you are also
a former drug dealer.

13:35.336 --> 13:37.077
That's fair.

13:37.207 --> 13:39.644
I actually might know how
we might be able to get them.

13:39.775 --> 13:41.995
Back when I was
a public defender,

13:42.169 --> 13:44.519
I helped this guy Jake get off
on date-rape charges.

13:44.693 --> 13:46.042
[scoffs]I love how you were bragging

13:46.216 --> 13:47.217
about not killing people.

13:47.348 --> 13:48.218
He didn't do it.

13:48.349 --> 13:49.785
[scoffs]Look.

13:49.916 --> 13:51.308
He didn't deserve
to go to jail

13:51.482 --> 13:52.788
because his friends
assaulted someone.

13:52.919 --> 13:53.876
Okay.

13:54.050 --> 13:56.487
Anyway,

13:56.661 --> 13:58.663
I know the bar
where they got them.

13:58.794 --> 14:00.317
Hopefully, this bartender
still works there,

14:00.491 --> 14:01.971
and maybe we can buy some
off of him.

14:02.145 --> 14:03.277
MURPHY: Weird thing
to hope for, but sure.

14:07.063 --> 14:09.109
[knocks on doorframe]

14:10.501 --> 14:12.112
[rock music plays quietly]

14:19.336 --> 14:20.642
Josh, hi. [laughs]

14:20.816 --> 14:21.904
Oh.Ooh, sorry.

14:22.078 --> 14:23.471
Sorry.
[laughs]

14:23.601 --> 14:25.690
Sorry. I was...
I was waving. I didn't...

14:25.821 --> 14:27.736
Anyway, I forgot. Sorry.It's okay. It's okay.

14:27.910 --> 14:28.955
Um...It happens.

14:29.129 --> 14:30.217
Annoyingly often
these days.

14:30.391 --> 14:32.393
Uh, please.

14:33.481 --> 14:35.439
Um, hi.

14:35.613 --> 14:36.745
Hi.

14:36.919 --> 14:38.616
Uh, what do you have here?

14:38.790 --> 14:41.750
Uh, it's just...
It's some stuff I compiled.

14:41.924 --> 14:43.970
May I?Yeah, please.

14:59.986 --> 15:01.335
Wow. This is...

15:01.509 --> 15:03.163
Insane? Crazy?

15:03.337 --> 15:05.034
Dead brother will do that
to you, I guess.No, no, no.

15:05.208 --> 15:07.297
Honestly, I was gonna say
"impressive."

15:07.428 --> 15:09.169
Really?Really.

15:09.343 --> 15:11.867
I, um... I guess
it's good to know

15:12.041 --> 15:13.825
that there's someone out there
who also wants

15:14.000 --> 15:15.610
to see Murphy Mason go down
as badly as me.

15:15.784 --> 15:17.655
Yeah, well, she's a horrible,
deranged murderer

15:17.829 --> 15:20.745
who will lie, cheat, or kill
to avoid going to therapy, so...

15:20.876 --> 15:24.314
Exactly my... Exactly.

15:24.445 --> 15:25.576
And when she stands trial
a second time,

15:25.750 --> 15:26.708
she'll be found guilty.

15:26.882 --> 15:28.884
I'll make sure of it.

15:29.058 --> 15:30.842
I'm just worried
she might flee in the meantime.

15:31.017 --> 15:33.541
So, if we can get her on moving
your brother's body, then...

15:33.671 --> 15:35.935
She'll go back to jail and
actually pay for what she did.

15:44.204 --> 15:46.467
I don't get it. We know that
Ben died at the Linsmore,

15:46.641 --> 15:47.859
and we know that Murphy
was there at the same time.

15:48.034 --> 15:49.339
Like, how is that not enough?

15:49.470 --> 15:51.167
Because there's no proof
that Ben was even there.

15:51.341 --> 15:53.169
They broke all
the security cameras.

15:53.343 --> 15:55.389
[indistinct chatter]

15:55.563 --> 15:56.520
Not in the storage room.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.480
Did Ben go in the storage room?

16:01.612 --> 16:03.223
No.

16:05.355 --> 16:06.313
Do you still have that footage?

16:06.487 --> 16:08.358
I do, yeah.

16:08.489 --> 16:10.056
Okay, I have pretty
good audio software.

16:10.230 --> 16:12.232
Maybe I could-- I don't know--
maybe I could

16:12.362 --> 16:14.190
try and enhance
the background audio,

16:14.364 --> 16:15.583
see if we can hear anything
at the bar.

16:17.367 --> 16:20.153
You really think
you could do that?Maybe.

16:20.327 --> 16:23.330
I also have some things I want
to show you at my apartment.

16:23.504 --> 16:28.030
My... my Murphy file isn't
as compact as yours.

16:28.204 --> 16:29.858
So I don't...

16:30.032 --> 16:32.078
Maybe you want
to swing by my flat tonight?

16:34.254 --> 16:35.777
Yeah, tonight works.

16:35.951 --> 16:37.997
Great.

16:38.171 --> 16:40.216
[hard rock playing]

16:44.133 --> 16:45.830
Hey, my man,
how you doing tonight?

16:45.961 --> 16:48.485
I'm all right. Yourself?Good, good.

16:48.659 --> 16:51.227
Um, I heard you could
hook me up with something.

16:51.401 --> 16:53.490
You want another IPA?[laughs]

16:53.664 --> 16:54.839
I'm talking about something
a little stronger

16:55.014 --> 16:57.277
for a date I'm meeting later.

17:01.411 --> 17:03.326
Sorry. Uh, who told you
to come here?

17:03.500 --> 17:05.198
Uh, my boy.

17:05.328 --> 17:06.982
My boy Jake.

17:09.811 --> 17:11.030
I don't know a Jake.

17:18.167 --> 17:20.517
What did you want from me?
Huh? Huh?

17:20.691 --> 17:21.779
He clearly works
through word of mouth,

17:21.910 --> 17:23.303
and I didn't have a name.

17:23.477 --> 17:25.174
So you chose Jake?

17:25.348 --> 17:27.655
You chose Jake? The guy who
got caught with roofies?

17:27.785 --> 17:29.657
I panicked.
I didn't know what else to say.

17:29.787 --> 17:32.573
Well... perfect.

17:32.747 --> 17:35.837
[phone buzzing]Oh, my God.
Paula just texted me.

17:36.011 --> 17:37.447
She wants me to come back.

17:37.578 --> 17:39.188
She's freaking out

17:39.362 --> 17:41.234
because Trevor still
hasn't responded to her.

17:41.364 --> 17:42.887
Here, I got it. I got it.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.672
What are you doing?

17:44.802 --> 17:46.108
Pretending to be Trevor.

17:46.282 --> 17:48.458
You just carry
around his phone?

17:48.589 --> 17:51.679
Yeah. I'll just say, uh,

17:51.809 --> 17:55.683
"They're making me do
late deliveries.

17:55.813 --> 17:57.250
"Can't say 'no.'

17:57.380 --> 17:58.816
You know how it is."

18:00.818 --> 18:02.907
[text whooshes][sighs]

18:04.561 --> 18:05.736
Did she say anything?

18:05.910 --> 18:09.044
[phone buzzing]

18:09.218 --> 18:11.046
"Trevor's being a little bitch.
Pick me up dinner."

18:11.177 --> 18:14.310
[sighs]Well...

18:14.484 --> 18:16.704
I guess we just go,
regroup tomorrow?

18:16.878 --> 18:18.706
Okay.

18:18.836 --> 18:20.621
I'll pay the tab.

18:23.841 --> 18:25.713
Damn it.

18:25.887 --> 18:28.150
Damn it, damn it,
damn it.

18:36.071 --> 18:38.073
So, are you
and Max really done?

18:41.076 --> 18:42.295
Yeah.

18:44.645 --> 18:47.126
After all that?

18:48.301 --> 18:50.216
Yeah.

18:50.390 --> 18:52.653
[indistinct chatter]

18:58.093 --> 18:59.573
Oh, my God.

18:59.747 --> 19:00.965
What?That's...

19:04.621 --> 19:06.971
Oh, my God!

19:09.148 --> 19:10.932
Uh, Jake?

19:12.455 --> 19:14.414
Jesus.

19:14.544 --> 19:15.806
No, no, no. I think that's...
That's-that's...

19:15.980 --> 19:17.982
That's the old guy.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.420
There you go.
You're doing good.

19:20.550 --> 19:22.378
What?Just get you in the car, and
get you home nice and safe.

19:22.552 --> 19:24.337
Hey!Jake?!

19:24.511 --> 19:25.599
DARNELL:
Let her go, man.We're good, dude. We're good.

19:25.773 --> 19:27.688
She just had too much to...Oh, my God.

19:27.862 --> 19:29.472
Oh, my God. Darnell.

19:29.646 --> 19:31.431
Damn it! [groans]

19:37.132 --> 19:38.699
DARNELL:
Y'all good, let's see.

19:42.050 --> 19:45.140
Yeah, we're out here
in the back. Yeah.

19:45.314 --> 19:47.142
I'll wait
till you guys get here.

19:47.273 --> 19:49.579
[sighs] Well, the cops
are on their way.

19:49.710 --> 19:51.929
I, uh... I'll make sure
she's okay.All right.

19:52.060 --> 19:54.149
Hey.

19:54.323 --> 19:56.847
So you guys will
spike the tequila.

19:57.021 --> 19:58.588
I'll pick up Paula's food, meet
you guys back there in a bit.

19:58.719 --> 20:00.111
Okay.Okay.

20:00.286 --> 20:01.939
MURPHY:Okay.Actually, wait.

20:02.940 --> 20:04.203
What are you doing?

20:05.856 --> 20:07.945
Making sure
this guy goes down.

20:09.904 --> 20:11.297
For good this time.

20:11.471 --> 20:13.821
And the cops need
to bust the bartender, too.

20:13.995 --> 20:15.518
Yeah.You'll make sure?

20:15.692 --> 20:18.260
I'll make sure.All right.

20:18.391 --> 20:20.088
You okay? Here.
Put your arm around me.

20:20.262 --> 20:21.698
Put your arm around me.

20:21.872 --> 20:23.613
Keep your head up.

20:23.744 --> 20:25.311
You're all right.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.101
You okay?

20:33.275 --> 20:35.799
I'm great. I just...

20:35.973 --> 20:38.889
helped that guy get off.

20:39.063 --> 20:40.891
Believed every word
that came out of his mouth.

20:41.065 --> 20:42.806
And because of me,
he's continued doing that

20:42.980 --> 20:45.026
to girls for years.

20:46.288 --> 20:48.421
It's not because of you.

20:48.551 --> 20:50.292
He's just disgusting.

20:52.686 --> 20:54.731
Seriously, men are the worst.

20:54.862 --> 20:58.735
I... I love how we're
the emotional ones, you know,

20:58.866 --> 21:02.522
but then, they're literally the
biggest babies on the planet.

21:02.652 --> 21:04.567
I guarantee you
some girl cheated on that guy.

21:04.741 --> 21:06.439
Or his mom didn't
hug him enough.

21:06.613 --> 21:10.312
Yes, or he's a sociopath
with zero feelings.

21:10.443 --> 21:12.358
Or he has feelings, he's just
too inept to deal with them.

21:12.532 --> 21:16.362
Right, so then he-he...
he drugs and rapes girls

21:16.536 --> 21:19.887
to get out his,
whatever, un...

21:20.017 --> 21:23.673
just unsolved anger.

21:23.804 --> 21:25.806
Why don't you just learn
how to cry, you loser?

21:27.895 --> 21:29.940
I just still feel like such an
idiot for believing him, though.

21:32.769 --> 21:34.554
Par for the
course, I guess.

21:39.689 --> 21:41.387
[sniffles]

21:41.561 --> 21:43.519
I am really sorry
about the whole Max thing.

21:45.608 --> 21:47.175
I'm sorry.

21:49.699 --> 21:51.919
Whatever. It's not like
we were friends anyway.

21:52.049 --> 21:54.704
And you're not the one
who cheated on me. He did.

21:54.835 --> 21:56.184
It's still not good.

21:56.358 --> 21:58.404
Yeah, well,
it is what it is.

21:58.578 --> 22:00.710
It's my fault, too.

22:00.841 --> 22:03.365
I let the dude move in
with me after, like, a week.

22:03.539 --> 22:05.759
Yeah, but I mean,
you are kind of a lesbian,

22:05.933 --> 22:07.500
and I feel like
it makes sense.

22:08.631 --> 22:10.503
[laughs]

22:10.633 --> 22:12.418
Sorry.

22:14.811 --> 22:17.074
He tried to get back
together with you, right?

22:18.554 --> 22:20.904
After I found out?You really doing this?

22:21.078 --> 22:22.384
That's a "yes."

22:22.558 --> 22:24.952
[sighs]

22:25.082 --> 22:27.650
Unbelievable.

22:27.824 --> 22:29.957
And then, when
you rejected him,

22:30.087 --> 22:32.394
he had the audacity to climb
back to into bed with me,

22:32.568 --> 22:34.657
and was all like...
[sniffles]

22:34.831 --> 22:37.617
"Baby, baby,
I'm-I'm so sorry."

22:37.791 --> 22:39.880
[snorts]"I love you so much.

22:40.054 --> 22:41.185
Like, come here."Okay.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.536
Mm, the begging.
I-I can't. I...

22:43.710 --> 22:44.754
He's so dramatic.I'm pretty sure,
at one point,

22:44.885 --> 22:45.755
he got down
on his hands and knees.

22:45.886 --> 22:47.757
No. No. Don't.Yes.

22:47.888 --> 22:49.759
[laughs]Oh, shut up.
That's so embarrassing.

22:49.890 --> 22:51.195
Um, I-I...

22:51.370 --> 22:53.197
My car is here.
You, um...

22:53.328 --> 22:55.939
Do you need help in?Uh, no. I'm good.

22:56.113 --> 22:57.767
Okay.Okay, thanks.

22:57.898 --> 22:58.942
Yeah, well, anyway,
it took everything in me

22:59.116 --> 23:00.683
not to laugh
in his face.

23:01.989 --> 23:04.252
[Lesley laughing]

23:04.426 --> 23:06.689
[keyboard keys clicking]

23:06.863 --> 23:08.604
[video playing indistinctly]

23:14.915 --> 23:17.831
[indistinct conversation]

23:18.005 --> 23:19.572
[knocking at door]

23:23.880 --> 23:26.056
Hey.Hey. [gasps]

23:26.230 --> 23:27.710
Oh, hi. Who's this?

23:27.884 --> 23:30.104
That's Oliver.Who's this? Hi.

23:30.278 --> 23:31.497
Ollie!Who's this?

23:31.671 --> 23:33.150
Ollie, come on, mate.
Leave her alone.

23:33.324 --> 23:34.195
Sorry. He knows
better than that.

23:34.369 --> 23:35.849
It's fine.Yeah.

23:36.023 --> 23:38.808
Um, please don't
judge the mess.

23:38.982 --> 23:41.724
I used to have a very
organized filing system, but

23:41.898 --> 23:43.726
it's become
really hard to read.

23:43.900 --> 23:46.555
This is a lot bigger
than my folder.[laughs]

23:46.729 --> 23:47.687
Uh, do you want a beer
or something?

23:47.861 --> 23:49.079
Yeah, a beer
would be great.Sweet.

23:52.735 --> 23:54.824
Uh, did you get anything
from that tape?

23:54.955 --> 23:56.565
Uh, unfortunately no.

23:56.739 --> 23:57.958
The, um, background audio
was too far away.

23:58.132 --> 23:59.220
Ollie.Ugh. That sucks.

23:59.394 --> 24:01.570
Yeah. I know.

24:01.744 --> 24:04.399
Okay, Ollie, that's
a good boy. Go on.

24:04.573 --> 24:06.706
Um, I was also combing through
some of the financial records

24:06.880 --> 24:08.359
at Guiding Hope.

24:08.534 --> 24:10.405
I mean, if
we can get her

24:10.579 --> 24:13.539
on-on money laundering
or-or something, then...

24:13.713 --> 24:15.584
I know it's not getting justice

24:15.758 --> 24:17.281
for your brother's
death, but I-I...Listen.

24:17.412 --> 24:23.157
All I want is for Murphy to be
behind bars, like, forever, so,

24:23.331 --> 24:25.638
whatever way
we can get that done, so...All right.

24:25.768 --> 24:28.858
I-I know it's not
traditional Friday fun,

24:28.989 --> 24:31.948
but you want to help?

24:32.122 --> 24:35.561
Not to brag, but I did get
an "A" in AP calculus.

24:35.735 --> 24:38.215
[laughs] Well,
this isn't like calculus.

24:38.389 --> 24:42.481
It's, I guess, more looking for
sketchy financial transactions.

24:42.655 --> 24:44.308
Well, that's good,

24:44.439 --> 24:45.527
'cause I actually don't remember
anything about calculus.

24:45.701 --> 24:47.573
[laughs]Zero. Zero about calculus.

24:47.747 --> 24:49.575
Nice. All right, cool.

24:49.749 --> 24:51.490
Well, look through here,
and if you see the name...

24:53.100 --> 24:56.756
I-I really needed to feed him,
so thank you for stopping here.

24:56.930 --> 24:59.541
Sure. I needed a place
to do this anyway.

25:01.151 --> 25:03.110
I told Paula
I was stuck at work,

25:03.240 --> 25:04.894
so that should
buy us some time.

25:05.025 --> 25:07.418
[Murphy clears throat]

25:07.593 --> 25:09.595
Why did you reject him?[sniffles]

25:10.987 --> 25:12.815
What?

25:12.989 --> 25:14.904
Max.

25:16.297 --> 25:18.125
Uh...

25:18.299 --> 25:19.822
just wasn't feeling it.

25:19.996 --> 25:22.172
Mm.

25:22.346 --> 25:23.696
Because of all the CI stuff.

25:25.088 --> 25:27.830
[sighs]

25:28.004 --> 25:30.616
That explains why you're also
blowing off my brother.

25:34.663 --> 25:37.536
I don't want anything bad
to happen to anyone, so...

25:41.191 --> 25:44.325
[lighter clicking]

25:44.499 --> 25:46.849
What's that smell?Little trick

25:47.023 --> 25:51.158
I learned in high school
when I stole my dad's booze.

25:51.288 --> 25:54.161
Just water it down
and remelt the wax.

25:54.335 --> 25:56.206
He could never tell.

25:58.861 --> 26:00.080
MURPHY [quietly]:
Good boy, buddy.

26:00.254 --> 26:01.560
You're such a good boy.

26:03.039 --> 26:05.520
Okay.

26:05.651 --> 26:08.088
[Murphy murmurs]

26:08.262 --> 26:10.394
Good boy.
You're such a good boy.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.222
[phone buzzing]

26:12.396 --> 26:13.659
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Text from Darnell.

26:13.833 --> 26:15.791
Just got the food.
Heading over there.

26:15.965 --> 26:17.271
You guys should leave, too.

26:17.445 --> 26:18.794
See you in a bit.Let's go.

26:37.639 --> 26:38.597
[car door closes]LESLEY:
Okay.

26:38.771 --> 26:40.642
Here you go.

26:40.773 --> 26:45.473
Here's a spare key
in case you don't hear from me.

26:45.647 --> 26:47.910
And I'll leave your names
with the doorman.

26:48.084 --> 26:50.130
We'll hear from you.

26:51.174 --> 26:53.437
Okay.

26:53.568 --> 26:56.266
Maybe, uh, just delete our texts
just to be safe.

26:56.440 --> 26:58.921
What?

26:59.095 --> 27:01.141
I-I'm just, I mean,
just being extra cautious.

27:01.315 --> 27:03.578
It's like wearing a condom
when you're on your period.

27:03.709 --> 27:04.797
You know, can't hurt.

27:06.450 --> 27:07.974
[Lesley sighs]

27:11.064 --> 27:13.109
Okay.

27:13.283 --> 27:16.635
I'll text you
when she passes out.

27:18.071 --> 27:20.726
Poker face.

27:20.900 --> 27:22.466
[sighs]

27:22.641 --> 27:24.643
Poker face.

[door opening]

27:42.312 --> 27:43.487
[gasps]

27:43.662 --> 27:44.924
Get in here.

27:45.098 --> 27:47.970
Get in.
What took you so long?

27:48.144 --> 27:50.320
I got tied up at work,
and the restaurant took forever.

27:50.494 --> 27:52.409
Did anyone follow you here?No.

27:52.583 --> 27:53.715
Did you see anyone outside?No.

27:53.889 --> 27:55.717
Did you tell anyone
I was here?

27:55.891 --> 27:58.677
Paula, come on. No.

28:06.423 --> 28:08.643
Something isn't right.

28:08.774 --> 28:10.514
I can feel it.

28:10.689 --> 28:13.996
[sighs]

28:14.170 --> 28:16.782
Trevor's the last person
I could trust,

28:16.956 --> 28:18.697
and our boss is
keeping him from me.

28:20.699 --> 28:21.961
I'm being pushed out.

28:22.135 --> 28:23.963
I know how this works.

28:24.137 --> 28:27.401
They want me gone.

28:27.575 --> 28:30.099
Mm-hmm. Which means
that I broke out of prison

28:30.230 --> 28:32.101
just so they could kill me.

28:32.232 --> 28:34.974
Well, I'm not
gonna let them.

28:35.104 --> 28:37.150
Well, maybe some food and
a drink would help you relax.

28:37.324 --> 28:39.021
I got you some more tequila.

28:39.195 --> 28:41.023
It's right there.Mm-hmm.

28:41.197 --> 28:43.069
Thanks.

28:43.243 --> 28:44.461
Hmm.

28:52.382 --> 28:53.906
Oh, my God.

28:58.911 --> 28:59.955
And what's this?[plates shatter]

29:09.704 --> 29:11.924
[gasps softly]

29:13.186 --> 29:15.014
Leave it.

29:19.583 --> 29:21.150
[bottle sliding across table]

29:28.636 --> 29:30.638
You put something in here?

29:30.812 --> 29:33.206
What? No. I just...Mm.

29:34.381 --> 29:36.296
Drink, then.

29:38.385 --> 29:40.561
I, um...Here.

29:40.735 --> 29:43.303
Drink.

29:48.003 --> 29:50.136
Hmm.

29:53.313 --> 29:55.663
Mm, that's nothing.
Have another.

30:03.845 --> 30:05.586
[electricity buzzing]

30:12.071 --> 30:13.333
Shouldn't we have
heard from her by now?

30:13.463 --> 30:16.162
I don't know.

30:16.336 --> 30:18.642
Probably. Maybe.

30:18.817 --> 30:21.776
[sighs]
This is bad.

30:21.907 --> 30:23.430
Come on. Hey, she's okay.

30:23.604 --> 30:26.476
You don't know that.

30:40.360 --> 30:42.144

there was nothing in there.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please.

30:50.805 --> 30:52.807
No. I swear to God.

30:52.938 --> 30:55.679
Yeah, well,
we'll find out.

Come on.

31:00.815 --> 31:02.251
Mm-hmm.

31:02.382 --> 31:04.601
Looks like
you've deleted some texts.

31:04.775 --> 31:07.039
I have a hard time believing
you got zero today.

31:07.213 --> 31:09.824
Huh?

31:09.955 --> 31:12.914
[panting]:
Uh, please.

to happen to you now, right?

with a little problem.

be dead by then.

need to hang on.

it was urgent.

it's right this way.

34:20.362 --> 34:21.711
She tried to poison me
or something.

34:23.235 --> 34:25.454
You got the silencer?

34:25.628 --> 34:28.805
Uh, Trev told me about that,
but I didn't have one on me,

34:28.979 --> 34:30.938
figured time was of the essence.

I'll just strangle the bitch.Just wait.

34:34.159 --> 34:36.509
I got you.
I'll take care of her elsewhere.

You don't want her
to wake up and scream.

Rich woman like this
is gonna draw heat.

34:43.559 --> 34:46.519
You don't need any more
attention on you. Trust me.

34:49.609 --> 34:51.393
He say something to you?

34:51.567 --> 34:53.395
Well, he doesn't talk to me,

34:53.569 --> 34:56.268
but between us, he's not happy.

34:56.398 --> 34:57.617
I heard
he saw the news coverage.

35:00.010 --> 35:02.230
Well, give me your phone.

35:02.404 --> 35:03.623
You don't want this
to trace back to you.

35:03.797 --> 35:05.233
I'll-I'll wipe it for you.

35:10.499 --> 35:12.197
All right, I got it.

to hide her in.

Yeah. She will be.

35:45.012 --> 35:47.667
[groans][groans softly]

35:47.841 --> 35:49.147
She'll be okay
in a couple hours.

35:49.321 --> 35:50.931
[panting]

35:55.892 --> 35:57.938
You know.I can't believe
you actually got her out.

35:58.112 --> 36:00.810
I told you I would.
Oh.

36:00.984 --> 36:02.377
And I also got Paula's phone.

36:02.551 --> 36:04.118
[beeping]

36:04.292 --> 36:07.208
You're kidding.Nope. [laughs]

36:07.339 --> 36:09.167
She only texted Trevor
and one other number.

36:09.341 --> 36:10.994
It's got to be the boss.

36:11.125 --> 36:12.692
If we can get him
to a meeting

36:12.866 --> 36:15.477
where he incriminates himself,

36:15.651 --> 36:17.175
they can arrest him.

36:17.349 --> 36:18.393
[laughs]

36:21.353 --> 36:23.442
But...

36:24.747 --> 36:26.271
But Lesley said

36:26.445 --> 36:28.403
Paula's boss isn't answering
any of her texts.

36:28.577 --> 36:30.492
Yeah, 'cause look what
she's been texting.

36:30.666 --> 36:32.190
"Do you have a place for me?"

36:32.364 --> 36:33.800
"I need cash."

36:33.930 --> 36:35.584
"Hello???" with
three questions marks.

36:35.715 --> 36:38.457
So?So she's an idiot.

36:38.631 --> 36:40.241
I know how these
people operate.

36:40.372 --> 36:41.808
This is how you
get a response.

36:43.375 --> 36:47.205
"Got two people
for you to meet.

36:47.379 --> 36:49.337

into the prison."

we can help you in.

37:03.395 --> 37:05.745
No. Felix is here.
I saw him on the door cam.

37:05.919 --> 37:07.703
Go before he sees you.

37:07.877 --> 37:10.271
All right, well,
get some rest.

37:10.445 --> 37:12.839
Yeah.

37:12.969 --> 37:16.973

37:18.845 --> 37:21.064

37:27.984 --> 37:30.117

to give it back at some point.

given her over the years,

38:08.024 --> 38:09.983
and, like, it was always...

38:10.157 --> 38:11.289
Yeah, yeah,
go on, go on.Ready?

38:11.463 --> 38:12.551

38:17.251 --> 38:19.209
I don't know when I'm gonna
be able to find it again.

see anything, and I...

No. Hey, hey, no, no, no, no.No.

Hey... no. No, no, no.That was so wrong. I'm sorry.

38:32.614 --> 38:34.355
Do you know... do you know
how angry that makes me?

38:34.486 --> 38:35.530
I'm sorry.No, at her, not at you.

38:35.704 --> 38:37.663
At her.

38:37.837 --> 38:40.796
You know, the fact she uses
her blindness to...

38:40.970 --> 38:42.624
Yeah, it's horrendous.

38:42.798 --> 38:44.713
To be fair, you know, I guess

38:44.844 --> 38:46.324
you could have just stopped
giving her free drinks.

38:46.498 --> 38:48.369
That's on you. No, no,
no, that's on you.
