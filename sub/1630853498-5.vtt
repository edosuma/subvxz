â™ª Loving every
Minute 'cause you

02:03.480 --> 02:06.320
Welcome to the
Subtropix Wildcard Trials,

02:06.400 --> 02:09.240
as some of our best
local talent battle it out

02:09.320 --> 02:12.120
for a chance to compete with
the pros at the upcoming

02:12.200 --> 02:15.520
international event,
the Subtropix 360.

02:17.480 --> 02:18.960
Over the next three days

02:19.040 --> 02:21.000
you'll be seeing
seasoned professionals,

02:21.080 --> 02:23.240
plucky groms and
everything in-between

02:23.280 --> 02:26.080
as they chase that
elusive wildcard.

02:30.240 --> 02:33.840
Don't worry boys,
I'll go easy on ya.

02:46.720 --> 02:48.200
Bodhi?

02:49.480 --> 02:50.640
Oh hi.

02:50.720 --> 02:52.680
Nice job making it
through your heat.

02:52.760 --> 02:55.320
Poppy made me look
like a kook, as usual.

02:55.400 --> 02:56.800
Don't be
so hard on yourself.

02:56.880 --> 02:58.560
-Great to see you Pops.
-Hi Molly.

03:00.200 --> 03:01.760
I'm sorry, things are going nuts

03:01.840 --> 03:04.080
with this whole
360 thing happening.

03:04.160 --> 03:07.000
Anyway, I'm loving how prolific
you are on the socials.

03:07.080 --> 03:09.320
We're shooting this new campaign
in the lead up to the event,

03:09.400 --> 03:11.720
and we've just had one
of our girls drop out.

03:12.320 --> 03:14.320
You haven't modelled
for us before have you?

03:17.240 --> 03:20.760
Okay, great.
We'll pick you up in an hour.

03:20.840 --> 03:22.280
World number 10, Nikki Van Dijk,

03:22.360 --> 03:26.120
has just been a rocket on the CT
this season, nice cutback there.

03:26.200 --> 03:28.160
So she's awesome.

03:28.240 --> 03:30.160
I can't believe you
get to work with her.

03:30.240 --> 03:31.800
I mean it's crazy
she didn't ask you.

03:31.880 --> 03:35.000
Shush, no.
They only needed one girl.

03:35.080 --> 03:37.440
You've been ready
for this since forever.

03:37.520 --> 03:38.760
Hey, why don't you come?

03:38.840 --> 03:40.720
You can shoot
some content for me.

03:40.800 --> 03:41.680
You sure about that?

03:41.760 --> 03:42.640
What's the worst
that can happen?

03:42.720 --> 03:44.800
Ah, she blows up the whole
shoot and ends your career.

03:44.880 --> 03:45.680
Oh shut up.

03:45.760 --> 03:49.440
Hey, anyone goes with you
it should be me right?

03:49.520 --> 03:51.600
They could put us
in a shoot together.

03:51.680 --> 03:54.320
Um, yeah let me ask
Molly about it.

03:58.840 --> 04:02.640
Tell me we're not
the next Alana and Jack.

04:02.720 --> 04:03.960
Let's go.

04:05.200 --> 04:06.680
I have no idea who that is.

04:08.200 --> 04:11.280
Men's heat two,
fifteen minute warning.

04:15.520 --> 04:18.240
You have
incredible hair. Wow!

04:22.280 --> 04:23.880
Love the colours.

04:25.120 --> 04:27.720
Ah sorry, who are you?

04:27.800 --> 04:30.320
Summer Torres.
Torres Management.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.080
I handle all Bodhi's socials.

04:32.160 --> 04:35.280
It's a big job keeping
100,000 follows interested.

04:35.360 --> 04:36.640
Know what I'm saying?

04:36.720 --> 04:38.720
I'm sure it is.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.400
Well Summer Torres
I run a pretty tight ship,

04:40.480 --> 04:42.440
so I'm going to need you
to be a fly on the wall, okay?

04:42.520 --> 04:43.600
Got it.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.120
Hey Molly.

04:49.720 --> 04:50.840
I don't have that
many followers.

04:50.920 --> 04:53.280
Nothing a couple of
Russian hackers can't fix.

04:53.360 --> 04:54.880
I hear they work cheap.

05:13.680 --> 05:16.280
-I guess we're besties now.
-Yeah, we go way back.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.520
Great guys.
Loving the vibe.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.160
Hey guys!

05:33.240 --> 05:34.560
Olha a bomba!

05:37.640 --> 05:39.120
Are you kidding?

05:41.120 --> 05:42.880
Whoo! How's it going?

05:42.960 --> 05:44.760
Marlon Sousa. Big fan.

05:44.840 --> 05:47.000
What do you think you're doing?
We're trying to work here.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.120
Halfway through day one

05:55.200 --> 05:57.600
and here are the results
from men's heat four.

05:57.680 --> 05:59.080
Hey, if we get
through this round,

05:59.160 --> 06:00.960
footage review at mine later?

06:01.720 --> 06:06.480
My odds are about a million
to one, but yeah, sure.

06:07.760 --> 06:10.400
Next up,
women's heat three.

06:10.480 --> 06:12.440
Again. I'm really sorry
about my boyfriend.

06:12.520 --> 06:14.680
Don't worry about it.
We got everything we needed.

06:14.760 --> 06:16.040
The crew van will
take you home.

06:16.120 --> 06:18.040
I will see you
at the trials tomorrow.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.600
Hey, awesome job today, guys.

06:29.840 --> 06:32.520
I'm sure Marlon didn't
blow things up entirely.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.480
Hey, you said it was cool
for me to come down.

06:35.560 --> 06:37.040
I thought you were joking.

06:40.600 --> 06:42.040
Sorry. I have to make a call.

06:48.440 --> 06:51.640
Yo, it is so refreshing when
someone else is in trouble.

07:20.120 --> 07:21.760
Dad?

07:25.000 --> 07:26.800
Dad, you okay?

07:26.880 --> 07:28.760
Tried to call you back,
but you didn't answer.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.720
Dad?

07:36.800 --> 07:38.840
Sorry I called you
so many times.

07:38.920 --> 07:39.720
I'm okay.

07:42.520 --> 07:44.400
I went to the shops.

07:50.880 --> 07:53.600
Hey, no light.
No light, please.

07:53.680 --> 07:58.080
Sorry. It's just been
really stressful.

07:59.960 --> 08:01.960
I just double booked
myself for tomorrow.

08:03.840 --> 08:04.640
Okay.

08:05.880 --> 08:08.280
Can we just cancel
the other job?

08:08.360 --> 08:11.720
Yeah, I was, I was going
to, but it's so last minute.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.200
I can't really afford
to lose this client.

08:13.280 --> 08:15.160
It's one of my only
regular houses.

08:17.640 --> 08:18.680
So let me help you.

08:21.120 --> 08:23.200
What, don't, don't you
have your trials thing?

08:23.280 --> 08:24.520
Don't worry about that.

08:25.360 --> 08:26.560
I'll work something out.

08:27.640 --> 08:28.440
Really?

08:31.280 --> 08:33.400
Okay. Okay, thanks sweetie.

08:52.120 --> 08:55.080
And as a decent set finally
rolls in, Ari Gibson,

08:55.160 --> 08:57.640
managing to claw his
way on to another one.

09:12.320 --> 09:14.680
And that ride should be
enough to see him

09:14.760 --> 09:18.480
join fellow local groms
Poppy Tetanui and Bodhi Mercer

09:18.560 --> 09:20.520
in tomorrow's quarter finals.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.360
Hey, should we get started?

09:31.440 --> 09:32.560
Yeah. For sure.

09:36.800 --> 09:38.640
Where are your bros tonight?

09:38.720 --> 09:43.200
Out, a bunch of their mates
are in town for the 360, so.

09:44.520 --> 09:45.360
Here, sit down.

09:47.680 --> 09:50.600
Pretty crazy, hey?
Bodhi in a fashion shoot.

09:51.880 --> 09:52.840
They're really backing her.

09:52.920 --> 09:54.400
Yeah, totally.

09:54.480 --> 09:55.440
It's not surprising though.

09:55.520 --> 09:57.280
She's like the full package.

09:57.360 --> 10:00.360
The right look, the
profile, the boyfriend.

10:08.960 --> 10:12.000
Hey, there's that
head thing again,

10:12.080 --> 10:14.520
my shoulder keeps
getting in the way.

10:14.600 --> 10:16.880
Here stand up,
get in your stance.

10:18.800 --> 10:21.240
Pretend there's a
broom along your back.

10:21.320 --> 10:22.120
Arms up.

10:23.280 --> 10:24.800
Now when you turn,

10:24.880 --> 10:28.720
you need to be looking
exactly where you want to go.

10:46.160 --> 10:48.000
What are you doing here?

10:48.800 --> 10:52.760
Well, um,
I just forgot my wallet.

11:02.520 --> 11:04.200
Have you heard
from your mum lately?

11:04.320 --> 11:06.280
Nope. Have you?

11:09.440 --> 11:10.200
I saw some posts

11:10.280 --> 11:12.480
about going to photograph
some rebel leader,

11:12.560 --> 11:14.520
deep behind enemy lines,
blah, blah.

11:15.920 --> 11:17.520
You're okay with that?

11:17.600 --> 11:18.680
Hey, if she got blown up,

11:18.760 --> 11:20.760
it would solve so
many of my problems.

11:27.560 --> 11:29.440
I'm sure you miss her.

11:29.520 --> 11:31.000
I know I do.

11:31.080 --> 11:33.600
-Why?
-Why?

11:33.680 --> 11:34.920
Yeah. I mean,

11:35.000 --> 11:36.720
I know you guys are meant to be
lifelong friends or whatever,

11:36.800 --> 11:38.920
but she just dumped her
delinquent daughter on you

11:39.000 --> 11:41.600
to go chase glory
in distant lands.

11:41.680 --> 11:43.520
Aren't you like
a little bit furious?

11:45.840 --> 11:48.480
Actually, I feel
really proud of her,

11:49.440 --> 11:51.960
of everything that
she's accomplished.

11:52.040 --> 11:53.920
I mean, do I wish that
she'd contacted me

11:54.000 --> 11:55.040
a little more
over the years?

11:55.120 --> 11:56.320
Sure.

11:56.400 --> 11:59.880
But, she really inspires me.

12:02.160 --> 12:04.600
She'd be way more inspirational
if she was a better person.

12:08.320 --> 12:11.000
Love, hi. How was your day?

12:13.240 --> 12:16.080
Um, fine.

12:24.360 --> 12:27.120
Day two,
and the men's quarterfinals.

12:27.200 --> 12:28.560
It's mostly pros out there,

12:28.640 --> 12:31.320
but Ari Gibson
managing to hold his own

12:31.400 --> 12:33.080
against a tough field.

12:51.760 --> 12:53.080
Yes, that's it, Ari.

12:53.320 --> 12:55.160
Hey, it looks like
your boyfriend

12:55.240 --> 12:56.200
might actually
make it through here.

12:56.280 --> 12:58.000
Shame I'd have to wax
him up in the final.

12:58.080 --> 12:59.520
He's not my boyfriend.

12:59.600 --> 13:02.000
And you really
embarrassed me last night.

13:02.080 --> 13:03.640
Mission accomplished.

13:03.720 --> 13:05.880
Hey, look, Ari's a good kid.

13:05.960 --> 13:07.120
But if you want
my honest opinion,

13:07.200 --> 13:08.840
boys are a distraction.

13:08.920 --> 13:10.920
Are you seriously talking
about a no-boy rule?

13:11.000 --> 13:13.880
All I'm saying is look at
Marlon and Bodhi, no focus.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.280
Actually, guys,
have you seen Bodhi?

13:16.360 --> 13:18.360
Her quarter final's
coming up soon.

13:18.440 --> 13:20.240
She's helping her old man

13:20.320 --> 13:21.880
with that big house
on Farley street.

13:21.960 --> 13:23.360
So maybe you
should go get her.

13:23.600 --> 13:24.640
I texted her.

13:24.720 --> 13:25.800
But we're kind of
fighting right now.

13:25.880 --> 13:27.720
What?
She's going to miss it.

13:28.720 --> 13:29.840
Give me the address.

13:41.160 --> 13:44.280
Yo. Open Sesame.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.000
Er, who are you?

13:50.080 --> 13:50.880
Is Bodhi here?

13:50.960 --> 13:52.000
Yeah. Yeah.

13:52.160 --> 13:53.720
She's just helping me with
some work at the moment.

13:53.800 --> 13:54.720
Yeah, I heard.

13:54.840 --> 13:55.920
Hey, excuse me.

13:56.000 --> 13:56.880
Hey, you can't
come in here.

13:56.960 --> 13:58.320
Bodhi.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.360
Hey, excuse me.

14:03.560 --> 14:04.720
Summer? Is something wrong.

14:04.800 --> 14:05.600
What are you doing here?

14:05.680 --> 14:07.440
What am I doing here?

14:07.520 --> 14:09.240
You've got her cleaning?

14:09.320 --> 14:11.400
On the verge of her
greatest surfing triumph.

14:11.480 --> 14:12.240
Bodhi who is this?

14:12.320 --> 14:14.520
I'm her social media manager
and she's coming with me.

14:14.600 --> 14:15.440
Summer, no.

14:16.920 --> 14:19.760
You realise you're ruining
a huge opportunity for her.

14:19.840 --> 14:21.520
Endangering her sponsorship.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.280
Hang on, I thought you said
you weren't on till later.

14:24.360 --> 14:25.760
Dad, it's cool.

14:25.840 --> 14:27.080
Summer, let's go outside.

14:29.040 --> 14:29.960
This isn't over.

14:39.240 --> 14:40.680
This crib is sick by the way.

14:40.800 --> 14:41.880
Summer I know you're
just trying to help,

14:41.960 --> 14:43.400
but you can't talk
to my dad that way.

14:43.520 --> 14:45.400
I call out bad parenting
when I see it.

14:45.520 --> 14:46.360
He's been through a lot

14:46.440 --> 14:48.200
and you being here
could get him fired.

14:48.280 --> 14:50.080
Yo, what is happening right now?

14:50.160 --> 14:52.880
I thought this trials thing
was like a huge deal for you.

14:52.960 --> 14:55.240
Look, it's not like I was
going to get through anyway.

14:55.320 --> 14:57.520
I've never even beaten
Poppy in a competition.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.520
Forget about a
bunch of QS surfers.

15:16.280 --> 15:17.440
Oh, to be young again.

15:17.520 --> 15:20.200
Poppy Tetanui has caught
about a hundred waves this heat

15:20.280 --> 15:22.120
and is back for more.

15:22.200 --> 15:23.880
With Bodhi Mercer a no-show

15:23.960 --> 15:26.960
Tetanui is doing
Shorehaven Boardriders proud.

15:37.600 --> 15:39.400
Tetanui wins.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.040
But it's not over yet.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.160
She'll have to beat the
winner of the sponsor's draw

15:43.240 --> 15:46.880
on final's day, tomorrow,
to claim that coveted Wildcard.

15:51.160 --> 15:53.120
So it's possible I overstepped.

15:54.520 --> 15:57.760
No. What happened was my fault.

15:57.840 --> 16:00.120
Look, I may be
completely off base here,

16:00.200 --> 16:01.520
but you seem to
spend a lot of time

16:01.600 --> 16:03.320
making sure other
people are okay.

16:04.960 --> 16:06.400
What about what you want?

16:15.640 --> 16:16.840
I'm going to go talk to her.

16:16.920 --> 16:19.480
Summer wait.
She's already upset with me.

16:19.560 --> 16:20.800
It's going to make it worse.

16:28.080 --> 16:29.160
Molly.

16:29.240 --> 16:30.440
Torres Management.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.160
Yeah, good memory.

16:32.720 --> 16:35.320
Listen, I would just like to
say on behalf of my client,

16:35.400 --> 16:37.600
she feels terrible
for the no-show

16:37.680 --> 16:40.440
and will do whatever it
takes to make it up to you.

16:40.520 --> 16:43.080
Look Bodhi, I know the
whole lifestyle thing

16:43.160 --> 16:44.920
is cool and it's fun.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.040
Inviting your friend and
your boyfriend to the shoot.

16:48.120 --> 16:49.080
But we're a surf brand.

16:49.160 --> 16:52.040
We support surfers who
are 100 percent committed.

16:52.120 --> 16:54.680
So if you're not,
this isn't going to work.

16:54.760 --> 16:55.680
I know that.

16:55.760 --> 16:57.560
And I know I can come
across as a flake sometimes,

16:57.640 --> 16:58.920
but that's not who I am.

17:01.040 --> 17:02.640
I really want this.

17:02.720 --> 17:04.640
She just has a
complicated home life.

17:04.720 --> 17:08.160
And I don't think she should
get punished for that, do you?

17:08.240 --> 17:10.640
Question is do I want to
invest in someone complicated?

17:10.720 --> 17:13.400
Molly, the question is does
Subtropix pay the big bucks

17:13.480 --> 17:14.800
to manage the easy ones?

17:15.840 --> 17:17.880
Do they need you for the
obedient sort of athletes

17:17.960 --> 17:19.040
with happy home lives?

17:19.120 --> 17:21.640
Or do those guys basically
look after themselves?

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
How old are you?

17:32.000 --> 17:33.840
Molly got me into
the sponsor trials.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.280
So I've got another shot.

17:35.360 --> 17:37.280
Oh, for real, lucky you.

17:38.440 --> 17:40.680
I know it's super unfair,
but I mean,

17:40.760 --> 17:41.960
I couldn't exactly say no.

17:42.040 --> 17:43.080
Of course you couldn't.

17:43.160 --> 17:45.360
Molly obviously
thinks you're a star.

17:45.440 --> 17:46.280
Take it.

17:47.360 --> 17:50.080
But the boys local
winner goes straight through.

17:50.160 --> 17:51.600
They've got two spots
for the boys.

17:51.680 --> 17:52.760
Only one for the girls.

17:52.840 --> 17:53.760
But that's sexist.

17:53.840 --> 17:54.880
That's surfing.

17:55.960 --> 17:58.320
Good luck Bodhs.
You make it count, yeah.

18:17.040 --> 18:18.880
And here
she goes again.

18:18.960 --> 18:22.520
Bodhi Mercer has come
from nowhere today

18:22.600 --> 18:24.920
to take a commanding lead
in the sponsor's draw.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.560
Yeah, woohoo.
Let's go Bodhi.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.760
Bodhi. Bodhi.

18:34.520 --> 18:35.840
Come on Bodhi.

19:50.680 --> 19:52.280
It's finals day.

19:52.360 --> 19:55.440
By the end of today, we'll
know who'll be joining the pros

19:55.520 --> 19:57.800
at the Subtropix 360.

19:59.960 --> 20:02.360
An intriguing Men's Final
about to get underway here

20:02.440 --> 20:04.720
with the journeyman
Joe Prawnie Tetanui

20:04.800 --> 20:08.800
looking to end the hot streak
of 15 year old Ari Gibson.

21:02.120 --> 21:04.960
Don't tell my brother,
but I wanted you to win.

21:05.880 --> 21:06.880
Thanks, mate.

21:06.960 --> 21:07.960
No worries, mate.

21:09.480 --> 21:10.720
Hey Ari. Listen.

21:12.720 --> 21:15.760
What happened at my place?
No big deal, okay.

21:15.840 --> 21:19.760
It was nice, but if you just
want to be friends, I'm good.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.600
I'm so glad you said that.

21:22.680 --> 21:24.680
That's exactly how I feel.

21:24.760 --> 21:26.440
We've been surf buddies
since forever.

21:26.520 --> 21:28.160
It would suck
to mess with that.

21:29.480 --> 21:31.320
I didn't want to
say anything while the...

21:31.400 --> 21:33.760
All good.
You're just being honest.

21:36.200 --> 21:38.080
Blah! So serious.

21:38.560 --> 21:40.120
Go celebrate.

21:56.880 --> 21:59.040
It all
comes down to this.

21:59.120 --> 22:03.760
Who's it going to be,
Tetanui or Mercer?

22:04.840 --> 22:08.120
Who could have believed
she'd make it all the way?

22:10.720 --> 22:12.080
Why can't you believe it?

22:14.400 --> 22:17.040
And yesterday, why did Summer
come get me and not you?

22:18.840 --> 22:20.120
I don't know.

22:20.200 --> 22:22.840
The comps haven't seemed
that important to you lately.

22:24.040 --> 22:26.120
Is that why you crashed
my photo shoot?

22:26.200 --> 22:28.560
Because it wasn't
important to me.

22:28.640 --> 22:31.400
You asked me to come,
then you completely snubbed me.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.160
I feel like this isn't working.

22:38.000 --> 22:38.800
What?

22:40.800 --> 22:42.800
I think I need to be
alone for awhile.

22:43.840 --> 22:46.200
There's so much going on.
I need to focus.

22:46.280 --> 22:47.720
Do some self-actualization.

22:50.600 --> 22:54.320
Wait, is this about
Ari in the hospital?

22:54.400 --> 22:56.560
Marlon, you're not listening.

22:56.640 --> 22:57.640
This is about me.

23:02.840 --> 23:03.680
Okay.

23:05.400 --> 23:06.360
Yeah, totally.

23:08.360 --> 23:09.720
I need to focus too.

23:11.680 --> 23:14.040
Great. I'm really glad
you feel the same way.

23:15.480 --> 23:16.280
Friends?

23:19.720 --> 23:20.840
Your dad is calling.

23:29.160 --> 23:31.480
And after
two full days of surfing,

23:31.560 --> 23:35.360
it's local youngsters,
Poppy Tetanui and Bodhi Mercer

23:35.440 --> 23:37.520
facing off in the Women's Final.
