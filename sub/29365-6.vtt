-Hey.

00:11.136 --> 00:12.387
Oh, I got one for you.

00:13.263 --> 00:16.599
If you had to pick one person
to endorse your athletic underwear,

00:17.100 --> 00:17.934
who would it be?

00:18.309 --> 00:19.728
Gisele or Tom Brady?

00:23.231 --> 00:25.150
For athletic underwear,
you gotta have balls,

00:25.233 --> 00:26.484
so I'd go with Gisele.

00:32.240 --> 00:33.116
Hey!

00:33.199 --> 00:34.242
Morning, boys.

00:36.745 --> 00:37.746
Beautiful day!

00:38.538 --> 00:40.790
Sun is shinin', the birds are chirpin'.

00:40.874 --> 00:43.126
Just makes you happy to be alive,
doesn't it?

00:45.545 --> 00:46.379
Is this a trap?

00:49.132 --> 00:51.426
If I say yes,
you gonna call me a fucking idiot?

00:52.927 --> 00:54.512
No, I'm in a good mood.

00:55.472 --> 00:56.306
[Colt] Huh.

00:57.474 --> 00:58.808
You should tell your face.

01:00.351 --> 01:01.561
Mornin', boys.

01:01.853 --> 01:03.605
Ah, see? Now, I believe her.

01:04.022 --> 01:05.982
Her face matches her words.

01:08.109 --> 01:09.235
Did you tell them yet?

01:09.319 --> 01:12.238
No. I'm waiting for them
to stop saying stupid shit.

01:14.115 --> 01:16.076
Well, we don't have that kinda time.

01:17.452 --> 01:18.953
Beau and I are getting married!

01:19.037 --> 01:22.123
-Oh! Ho-ho!
-Holy shit!

01:22.207 --> 01:23.458
Congratulations!

01:23.541 --> 01:24.959
I proposed to her,

01:25.043 --> 01:26.961
-not the other way around.
-[Colt] Wow!

01:27.295 --> 01:29.631
-That is really--
-That's great.

01:29.714 --> 01:30.673
[Joanne] Okay.

01:33.009 --> 01:33.843
Dude!

01:34.385 --> 01:36.346
What the hell? You just hug blocked me!

01:38.139 --> 01:39.474
Enough with the fuckin' huggin'.

01:39.599 --> 01:40.892
Oh. Great!

01:41.309 --> 01:42.310
Now the moment's over.

01:42.393 --> 01:43.645
Thanks a lot, Luke.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.690
So, when's the big day?

01:47.774 --> 01:50.068
We're gonna go to the courthouse
this week.

01:50.151 --> 01:52.237
We don't wanna bother everybody
with a big production.

01:52.320 --> 01:53.321
-What? No!
-[Luke] Mm.

01:53.404 --> 01:55.615
Come on. We love you guys.
We gotta do it here.

01:55.698 --> 01:57.242
Plus it's no bother for a father and son

01:57.325 --> 02:00.912
to run down to Men's Wearhouse
to get matching ties and cummerbunds.

02:03.164 --> 02:05.291
I'm not wearing a fucking cummerbund.

02:07.627 --> 02:08.545
How about this?

02:08.628 --> 02:10.672
You let us plan something nice for you,

02:10.755 --> 02:13.133
you know,
nothing too crazy and ostentatious.

[gasps]

02:18.179 --> 02:19.389
Beautiful spread.

02:19.472 --> 02:20.723
That might be kinda nice

02:20.807 --> 02:23.393
to have something here,
for family and friends.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.353
My daughter won't be able to make it,

02:25.436 --> 02:27.105
'cause she can't leave the state.

02:27.355 --> 02:29.524
But that's really for the best.

02:29.816 --> 02:33.194

that ankle bracelet going off.

Hey, Peyton could be the flower girl.

02:54.757 --> 02:57.594
She's not walking yet
but we could sit her on the Roomba,

02:57.719 --> 02:58.887
I do it at my parents'.

02:59.053 --> 03:00.555
Oh, my God, she loves it!

03:00.638 --> 03:02.807
When she drops a Cheerio,
picks it right up.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.353
I'll put her in the car.

I've used that SodaStream once
and, no, it does not make beer.

03:25.288 --> 03:28.249
You gonna start the car
and back it outta the driveway, too?

03:30.418 --> 03:31.336
Very funny.

03:32.503 --> 03:34.964
-Alright, drive safe.
-Okay, hang on a second.

03:35.715 --> 03:37.592
We gotta talk about the other night.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.428
Okay. You gonna forgive me
and move back in?

03:41.262 --> 03:43.514

How's business?

Fantastic. An 80-year-old woman
got hit by a bus with my ad on it.

05:28.369 --> 05:30.288
First thing she saw when she came to

05:30.580 --> 05:31.831
was a picture of me

She was and she did.

Yeah, well, we all aint lucky enough
to get hit by a bus, Jerry.

The water rights from the Stockwell Ranch

06:06.949 --> 06:10.078
go back farther
than any other parcel in the area.

Shit!

06:11.537 --> 06:13.873
Yep. But... it turns out

06:14.207 --> 06:17.585
that your land was originally part
of the Stockwell Ranch.

06:17.960 --> 06:20.338
That means
you have as much right to that water

06:20.421 --> 06:21.589
as Neumann's Hill does.

06:22.256 --> 06:25.593
In future, Jerry, why don't
you just start out with the good news?

bill by the hour. [laughs]

Right. So, what's next?
What do we do now?

06:32.058 --> 06:35.395
Well, next thing would be
to file an injunction.

06:35.686 --> 06:38.189
And then, based on the precedents
of other cases,

06:38.272 --> 06:40.691
we'll probably be able
to get the dam opened up

06:40.775 --> 06:43.903
and get water flowing through your land
and everyone downstream

06:44.028 --> 06:45.738
until the lawsuit is settled.

Okay. I mean, we don't have to
see a therapist. We could see a priest.

10:46.145 --> 10:47.855
What's a priest know about marriage?

11:17.093 --> 11:19.095
with a joint Facebook page
who are so fucking happy.

11:19.178 --> 11:20.513
I hope they get a divorce.

11:22.890 --> 11:23.724
Fuck!

11:25.309 --> 11:27.812
Look, I ain't got time for this right now.

11:27.895 --> 11:30.856
Will you at least think about it?
If not for me, for Peyton?

11:32.233 --> 11:33.901
-I'll think about it.
-Thank you.

11:33.984 --> 11:35.403
I'll try and get some names.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.863
Like I said, I ain't got no issues.

11:38.614 --> 11:40.241
Just make sure it ain't a woman.

11:42.618 --> 11:44.620
Or any man that's younger than me.

11:47.164 --> 11:48.791
Or anyone who looks like my dad.

11:52.128 --> 11:54.130
If they don't drink beer, I ain't going.

11:58.092 --> 11:59.176
[Colt] Right, fellas.

11:59.844 --> 12:01.721
Three shots of Jameson.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.557
I'm not drinking any shots.

12:05.641 --> 12:08.894
Come on. It's three Jamesons neat
in tiny little glasses.

12:10.938 --> 12:14.984
You can call me Tom Hanks
'cause I'm here for the bachelor party.

12:15.693 --> 12:17.945
This isn't a goddamn bachelor party.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.531
Then I better cancel the stripper

12:20.614 --> 12:23.659
I hired to dance to
"You're a Grand Old Flag."

12:24.660 --> 12:25.494
[Dale laughs]

12:25.578 --> 12:28.080
You call it whatever you want.
We're here for you.

12:28.164 --> 12:29.415
Alright. To my dad.

12:29.790 --> 12:31.542
I remember
when I went on my first date,

12:31.959 --> 12:34.795
you told me to treat her
like she's the only woman in the world.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.298
That's exactly how you treat Joanne.

12:37.715 --> 12:41.594
I also told you that women don't like men
who wear their mother's makeup.

12:44.513 --> 12:45.848
I was concealing a pimple.

12:48.225 --> 12:50.144
Yeah, that's perfectly natural

12:50.227 --> 12:52.605
to have a breakout
during your first period.

12:52.688 --> 12:55.608
[raucous laughter]

12:55.691 --> 12:56.859
[Luke] Fucking girl.

12:57.109 --> 12:59.111
[laughter continues]

13:00.029 --> 13:02.573
I don't know if you boys know this or not,

13:02.656 --> 13:05.493
but my first date with my wife, Charlene,

13:05.576 --> 13:07.620
was a double date with Beau and Maggie.

13:07.995 --> 13:10.915
So, just you and three ladies, huh, Dale?

13:14.668 --> 13:15.961
Fuck you. That's funny.

13:17.338 --> 13:21.300
Yeah. Beau has been there
at every important moment in my life.

13:21.884 --> 13:24.345
And now, I get to be there

13:24.804 --> 13:28.349
and witness you marrying your soul mate.

13:28.432 --> 13:31.185
Now, can we all stop saying
that shit about me?

13:31.268 --> 13:32.228
I know I'm done.

13:32.686 --> 13:34.063
No, wait. I got one.

13:34.146 --> 13:35.064
I wanna go.

13:35.523 --> 13:38.567
Now, I've known Beau
going on six, seven...

13:38.651 --> 13:39.568
weeks now,

13:40.277 --> 13:42.905
and everyone says
that since meeting Joanne,

13:42.988 --> 13:44.865
he's become a nicer, sweeter man.

13:45.741 --> 13:48.118
Frankly, I still find him quite abrasive,

13:48.202 --> 13:50.704
but I guess the point
I'm trying to make is,

13:51.080 --> 13:55.125
I'm just so grateful I didn't meet him
before he met Joanne. So, cheers!

13:55.209 --> 13:57.044
-[cell phone buzzes]
-[Colt] Fuckers.

13:57.878 --> 13:59.755
You just get that picture I sent you?

14:00.339 --> 14:02.091
That's your beer and my balls.

14:03.634 --> 14:05.344
No, it's from Jerry.

14:06.303 --> 14:08.138
They denied the fucking injunction.

14:08.889 --> 14:10.891
Neumann's Hill don't have to
take their dam down.

14:11.267 --> 14:14.103
Jesus Christ.
I thought he said it was a sure thing.

14:14.645 --> 14:18.482
Neumann's Hill's got those deep pockets,
they probably paid somebody off.

14:19.942 --> 14:21.569
How am I supposed to survive?

14:21.777 --> 14:23.946
How am I supposed
to take care of my family?

14:24.071 --> 14:26.991
And like-- What about the Kincaids?
And the Hollisters?

14:27.074 --> 14:30.160
She's taking out three ranches,
she don't even give a shit.

14:30.744 --> 14:32.705
So, wait, that's it? We're just fucked?

14:32.788 --> 14:33.706
[pool balls click]

14:33.789 --> 14:36.584
I mean...
the bad guys aren't supposed to win.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.711
Voldemort doesn't kill Harry Potter.

14:39.253 --> 14:40.963
As a matter of fact, he does.

14:43.215 --> 14:45.634
Harry is the final horcrux.

14:47.970 --> 14:49.305
Goddamn lawyers.

14:50.222 --> 14:53.100
Back in the day, we wouldn't worry
about any of this shit.

14:53.934 --> 14:54.768
We just...

14:55.352 --> 14:57.479
found a way to handle it ourselves.

14:59.773 --> 15:01.650
-I ain't gonna let her win.
-[Dale] No.

15:02.443 --> 15:03.569
Well, I got your back.

15:03.944 --> 15:04.987
What's your plan?

15:06.280 --> 15:07.406
Fucked if I know.

15:08.073 --> 15:09.950
Cool. The usual plan.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.704
Enough of this depressing shit.

15:14.038 --> 15:16.123
I'm gonna go put Pink on the jukebox,

15:16.206 --> 15:18.042
and we'll get this party started!

15:24.506 --> 15:25.341
Howdy.

15:25.966 --> 15:26.926
Colt...

15:27.259 --> 15:28.636
How did you get in here?

15:28.928 --> 15:30.930
Let's just say your assistant's a fan.

15:33.349 --> 15:35.726
Of Michael Kelso,
who she thinks I look like.

15:41.357 --> 15:42.816
It's only gonna take a moment.

15:43.025 --> 15:45.611
I see you more than I see my therapist.

15:47.154 --> 15:48.530
And d'you feel like it helps?

15:48.614 --> 15:49.490
[Lisa] Alright...

15:50.366 --> 15:52.117
Are you here about the injunction?

15:53.035 --> 15:55.496
'Cause the court denied it
and there's nothing you can do.

15:55.579 --> 15:58.040
Oh, I know. Yeah, we lost that battle.

15:58.457 --> 16:02.086
But my lawyer reassures me
we're gonna win the case.

16:03.003 --> 16:04.922
So, why don't we just cut to the end?

16:05.381 --> 16:07.132
Why don't you take down the dam?

16:07.216 --> 16:09.385
Lookee there.
I'm saving you time and money.

16:09.468 --> 16:10.886
I'm like the GEICO gecko.

16:12.596 --> 16:15.766
Colt, I have a team of the best lawyers
money can buy.

16:16.266 --> 16:19.228
[scoffs] Well, my lawyer
is on the side of a bus.

16:21.563 --> 16:23.107
And I'm in the right.

16:23.440 --> 16:25.192
[chuckling] Well, the thing is,

16:25.317 --> 16:28.153
you know, it doesn't really matter
who's right or wrong.

16:28.570 --> 16:31.448
You think it's a coincidence
your injunction was denied?

16:32.491 --> 16:36.036
The district attorney has been
in my suite at the Broncos games

16:36.120 --> 16:37.955
every Sunday for the last six years.

16:38.247 --> 16:40.791
In fact, you spilled mustard on his shirt.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.795
We got him a club soda.
He said it was fine.

16:47.548 --> 16:50.175
Look, I can make this case go on
for years.

16:50.884 --> 16:54.179
You'll run out of money
long before we get a final verdict.

16:55.180 --> 16:58.267
It'll cost you everything
and it won't change my life at all.

17:01.228 --> 17:02.855
Okay, I know you don't like me.

17:04.189 --> 17:06.316
What about them other ranchers downstream?

17:07.359 --> 17:09.778
Don't you care about their families,
their lives?

17:10.029 --> 17:12.406
It is not my responsibility

17:12.698 --> 17:13.949
to rescue people.

17:14.658 --> 17:17.578
Jeez... And I'm not gonna apologize
for being a success

17:17.661 --> 17:19.163
because other people fail.

17:21.415 --> 17:22.291
Ah.

17:23.709 --> 17:26.420
Okay, so this is just all about money
and greed to you?

17:26.503 --> 17:28.213
Just... please.
[scoffs]

17:28.922 --> 17:30.716
Why are you running your ranch?

17:31.842 --> 17:33.510
The same reason I am:

17:33.594 --> 17:36.221
to make money,
and I just happen to be better at it.

17:37.723 --> 17:40.851
Just 'cause you got more money than me
don't make you a better rancher.

17:40.934 --> 17:41.852
Look... [scoffs]

17:42.227 --> 17:44.897
I have never seen anyone
work harder than you.

17:44.980 --> 17:46.440
But where has it gotten you?

17:46.648 --> 17:48.192
To the brink of disaster?

17:50.444 --> 17:53.864
Not everyone is a leader.
The world needs workers, too.

17:56.617 --> 17:58.327
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

17:58.827 --> 18:02.664
It means that everyone is born
with different genetic proclivities.

18:02.748 --> 18:05.834
You're fast and strong,
that's what made you good at football.

18:06.335 --> 18:07.878
I have a good mind for business

18:07.961 --> 18:11.090
and that's why I am
the most successful rancher in Colorado.

18:15.135 --> 18:16.470
You're underestimating me.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.347
[sighs] Well, I...

18:19.014 --> 18:20.557
I don't think that's possible.

18:22.559 --> 18:23.393
Fuck you.

18:27.314 --> 18:28.524
I'm gonna take you down.

18:33.195 --> 18:35.823
-[door creaks]
-Hey. Check it out.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.491
I taught Drake to be the ring bearer.

18:37.866 --> 18:40.119
Okay, hey, Beau's in his bedroom. Okay?

18:40.786 --> 18:41.620
Go to Beau!

18:42.412 --> 18:43.539
Go to Beau! Go...

18:44.665 --> 18:47.334
-[Drake barking]
-Well, that was a waste of two hours.

18:48.919 --> 18:51.672
Hopefully there ain't no squirrels
during the vows, huh?

18:51.755 --> 18:53.924
-[Luke] Mm-hmm.
-I gotta ask you something.

18:55.217 --> 18:58.846
If someone said that you had
a genetic... proclivity

18:59.012 --> 19:01.181
to being fast and strong,
what do they mean?

19:01.265 --> 19:04.685
Dude, I'm not racing you again.
I beat you fair and square last time.

19:06.061 --> 19:07.271
No... Look...

19:07.563 --> 19:10.399
Lisa Newman said
I had a genetic proclivity

19:10.566 --> 19:11.942
to being fast and strong,

19:12.151 --> 19:13.777
and she's got one for business.

19:13.861 --> 19:15.237
So, like, what's that mean?

19:15.320 --> 19:18.031
[laughing] Wow--
She's saying you're fucking stupid.

19:21.326 --> 19:22.161
Yeah.

19:22.744 --> 19:23.871
That's what I thought.

19:25.080 --> 19:27.374
After the ceremony,
you help me out with something?

19:27.916 --> 19:28.750
Yeah.

19:29.126 --> 19:30.169
Do I need a vehicle,

19:30.544 --> 19:31.378
or a weapon?

19:32.129 --> 19:33.589
Or a vehicle that's a weapon?

19:35.048 --> 19:36.466
No. [mumbles]

19:36.884 --> 19:38.260
Although I ain't ever gonna say no

19:38.343 --> 19:40.429
to strappin' a chainsaw
to the front of an ATV.

19:40.512 --> 19:42.890
-[Luke laughs]
-No. When you was in the Army--

19:42.973 --> 19:44.433
[Heather] Just fuckin' leave!

19:45.976 --> 19:47.269
[Mary] This isn't your house.

19:47.352 --> 19:48.896
You can't tell me what to do.

19:48.979 --> 19:51.273
It's not yours either.
You shouldn't be here.

19:51.356 --> 19:53.775
Oh, please. Are you in charge
of the guest list?

19:54.067 --> 19:55.235
You fuckin' kidding me?

19:56.320 --> 19:58.488
Hey, Mary, what are you doing here?

19:59.114 --> 20:01.200
I just came to be at my friends' wedding.

20:01.533 --> 20:02.367
She's high.

20:02.451 --> 20:03.785
Oh, please.

20:04.119 --> 20:06.705
Like you guys aren't gonna get drunk
off your asses.

20:06.788 --> 20:09.166
You have enough beer here
for a Raiders' game.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.127
Just go on and get outta here.

20:12.461 --> 20:14.004
Uh-uh. I'm allowed to be here.

20:14.254 --> 20:15.088
Okay?

20:15.172 --> 20:17.591
I trained Joanne at the Cracker Barrel.

20:18.258 --> 20:21.136
Beau and I were in the church
bowling league for a decade.

20:21.428 --> 20:24.264
Do you have a shirt that says
"Jesus Strike Superstars"?

20:26.516 --> 20:28.101
A very envious no.

20:29.061 --> 20:29.895
Listen.

20:30.103 --> 20:31.772
Why ain't you go chill
in the hunting cabin?

20:31.855 --> 20:33.065
OK? Take a little break.

20:33.148 --> 20:34.775
I'll come talk to you later.

20:34.983 --> 20:38.111
You may already know this
but Rooster left a big ole jackpot

20:38.195 --> 20:39.613
full of McRibs in the freezer.

20:39.696 --> 20:40.530
[door creaks]

20:40.948 --> 20:41.865
[Beau] What's goin' on?

20:42.783 --> 20:45.160
This train wreck's about
to ruin your weddin'.

20:45.452 --> 20:48.121
I just came to support you and Joanne
on your big day.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.749
You know, have some fun.

20:51.166 --> 20:53.043
Wrestle Colt for the bouquet.
[laughs]

20:55.879 --> 20:59.675
-I... I'm really sorry about this.
-Don't fucking apologize for me.

20:59.883 --> 21:02.135
-Hey, let's go get a cuppa coffee--
-Stop it!

21:02.219 --> 21:03.303
[Luke] Let's you and I--

21:03.387 --> 21:04.513
[Mary] Fu-- Goddammit!

21:05.180 --> 21:07.474
I tripped! Okay?

21:07.557 --> 21:10.978
Jesus! Why is everybody
so fuckin' worried about me?

21:11.061 --> 21:13.188
-Got me. I don't give a shit.
-Colt.

21:13.647 --> 21:14.481
Mary?

21:15.941 --> 21:17.067
You have a problem.

21:17.150 --> 21:19.278
What? Fuck. Joanne, really?

21:20.112 --> 21:23.031
How many times did we get high
outside the Cracker Barrel?

21:23.448 --> 21:27.160
You were the one who taught me to roll
a giant joint outta the kids' menu.

21:28.495 --> 21:30.956
We just want to help you, Mary.
We care about you.

21:31.164 --> 21:32.165
You care about me?

21:32.374 --> 21:35.377
If you care about me so much,
why wasn't I fuckin' invited?

21:35.460 --> 21:37.462
[insects chirping]

21:39.298 --> 21:40.674
[sighs] What am I doing?

21:41.216 --> 21:43.593
I'm begging to be at this shitshow.

21:44.261 --> 21:45.095
[laughs]

21:45.470 --> 21:46.430
Oh, wait!

21:47.055 --> 21:48.223
Forgot your gift.

21:49.308 --> 21:50.142
[Drake barking]

21:55.230 --> 21:57.816
The couple have prepared their own vows.

21:58.817 --> 21:59.651
Joanne.

21:59.901 --> 22:00.861
Hold on a minute.

22:09.453 --> 22:11.288
-Just in case.
-[guests laugh]

22:12.372 --> 22:15.584
She has Alzheimer's but she got
a great sense of humor about it.

22:15.792 --> 22:17.085
[guests laugh]

22:20.464 --> 22:22.341
Beau, when I was first diagnosed,

22:22.424 --> 22:24.176
I tried to hide it from everybody.

22:24.968 --> 22:27.304
And then, when I finally told you,
I ran away.

22:28.096 --> 22:28.930
But...

22:29.014 --> 22:30.766
you wouldn't let me
go through this alone and

22:30.849 --> 22:31.933
thank God because...

22:33.101 --> 22:35.645
the only place I feel safe
is here with you.

22:37.314 --> 22:39.274
You're loyal, you're dependable,

22:40.108 --> 22:42.736
you run pretty well
considering all the miles on you.

22:42.819 --> 22:44.196
You're the Chevy of men.

22:45.113 --> 22:46.698
-[laughter]
-[woman] It's true.

22:46.782 --> 22:49.451
Aren't you supposed
to be saying something nice?

22:49.534 --> 22:51.536
[guests laugh]

22:52.704 --> 22:54.748
I never thought I'd find love this late.

22:55.791 --> 22:59.169
Which begs the question, "Where the heck
have you been all my life?"

22:59.252 --> 23:00.879
[guests exclaims and laugh]

23:01.004 --> 23:04.007
You can't follow that, Beau!
You shoulda gone first.

23:07.844 --> 23:09.346
Joanne, you're my best friend,

23:09.846 --> 23:11.014
the love of my life.

23:11.681 --> 23:13.850
Never mind! He's coming out hot!

23:13.975 --> 23:14.976
[laughter]

23:15.477 --> 23:17.521
I know I'm not an easy man to live with.

23:17.938 --> 23:20.941
Well, you can stop right there.
[sniggers]

23:22.609 --> 23:26.696
I also know, that my family
presents its own set of challenges.

23:28.907 --> 23:30.784
Despite all that, you're still here.

23:32.786 --> 23:34.162
I know I don't deserve you,

23:35.247 --> 23:36.915
but I'm gonna make you a promise.

23:37.332 --> 23:39.543
I'm gonna try to be a better man
every day...

23:41.128 --> 23:43.422
-[Peyton whines]
-...But if we live to be a thousand,

23:43.505 --> 23:46.258
I'm never gonna be as good a person
as you are.

23:47.134 --> 23:47.968
[Luke] Damn!

23:48.593 --> 23:51.471
If she won't marry you,
I'll hook my car to that 'stache.

23:54.099 --> 23:55.183
I love you, Joanne.

23:55.559 --> 23:56.643
I love you, too...

23:57.686 --> 23:58.520
Um...

24:01.189 --> 24:02.274
Beau. That's it.

24:03.733 --> 24:04.609
Beau,

24:05.485 --> 24:07.362
do you take Joanne to be your wife?

24:08.447 --> 24:09.322
I do.

24:10.240 --> 24:11.074
Joanne,

24:11.533 --> 24:13.452
do you take Beau to be your husband?

24:14.161 --> 24:16.538
Well, if it's a mistake,
I'll forget about it pretty soon.

24:16.621 --> 24:18.415
So... I do.

24:18.582 --> 24:19.708
[guests laugh]

24:19.833 --> 24:22.377
She jokes to make us all feel comfortable.

24:24.671 --> 24:27.299
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

24:29.759 --> 24:31.136
[guests cheer]

24:34.806 --> 24:35.640
Get in!

24:35.724 --> 24:36.975
Woo! Woo! Woo!

24:37.934 --> 24:38.977
[Heather] That was so nice.

24:39.478 --> 24:43.148
I don't think I've ever been to a wedding
where the bride wasn't pregnant.

24:47.736 --> 24:50.280
-Welcome to the family, Joanne.
-[Joanne] Aw.

24:51.781 --> 24:52.824
Thank you, Colt.

24:53.533 --> 24:55.952
-I guess you're my step-shithead now.
-[chuckles]

24:56.495 --> 24:57.871
Yeah, I suppose.

24:59.289 --> 25:00.123
Daddy!

25:00.916 --> 25:02.918
-Let's get it over with.
-[laughs]

25:03.001 --> 25:04.044
[Luke] Oh, man!

25:05.003 --> 25:07.005
-I love--
-Are you fuckin' kidding me?

25:08.298 --> 25:09.799
Congratulations, Uncle Beau.

25:10.175 --> 25:11.134
Thank you.

25:14.554 --> 25:16.681
I'm glad I got to spend the day with you.

25:20.977 --> 25:23.980
[Colt] For someone who never hugs,
how are you so good at it?

25:25.815 --> 25:27.442
[Abby] You look absolutely beautiful.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.402
-I'm so happy for you both.
-[chuckles]

25:29.736 --> 25:31.863
And I heard a rumor that KFC is catering.

25:31.947 --> 25:33.198
-Where we at on that?
-Oh, yeah.

25:33.281 --> 25:35.450
Coronel Sanders was first
on the guest list.

25:35.534 --> 25:36.451
[both laugh]

25:36.660 --> 25:37.619
[Abby] Come on.

25:37.702 --> 25:39.704
-Congratulations.
-Well, thank you, Hank.

25:39.788 --> 25:41.623
You look so handsome in your suit.

25:41.706 --> 25:43.542
I  just come from my arraignment.

25:43.708 --> 25:44.709
[Joanne] Uh.

25:46.419 --> 25:47.587
You ready to do this?

25:47.837 --> 25:48.755
Hell yeah.

25:50.340 --> 25:51.424
Where you guys going?

25:52.175 --> 25:53.301
-[Peyton gurgles]
-Err.

25:54.344 --> 25:56.972
Oh, we got some... ranching... stuff.

25:57.055 --> 25:57.889
Really? Now?

25:58.473 --> 25:59.349
Yeah. We had a...

25:59.808 --> 26:01.434
cow got loose this morning,

26:01.518 --> 26:03.895
a gate left open.
We looked for it all day.

26:04.229 --> 26:05.730
We don't want it to go into the night.

26:05.814 --> 26:07.148
Yeah. Tragically,

26:07.232 --> 26:09.442
it's the one that's most scared
of the dark.

26:10.527 --> 26:11.361
[Peyton gurgles]

26:11.861 --> 26:13.071
We'll be back in a bit.

26:13.154 --> 26:15.532
I mean, it is your dad's wedding.
Can't it wait?

26:15.615 --> 26:17.367
KFC is ready!

26:17.742 --> 26:18.868
Ooo, the Coronel!

26:24.332 --> 26:26.167
[football on TV]

26:26.334 --> 26:28.670
-Where the fuck you been?
-Don't worry about it.

26:28.753 --> 26:30.171
Where's the fuckin' pills?

26:30.463 --> 26:31.881
Err, we finished 'em.

26:31.965 --> 26:34.050
Oh... Fuck! FUCK!

26:34.843 --> 26:36.052
What the hell?

26:36.136 --> 26:38.430
God! I'm sorry.
What? Did you start recycling?

26:38.930 --> 26:40.473
What the fuck's going on with you?

26:40.557 --> 26:43.018
Nothing, okay? I just need some pills.

26:43.101 --> 26:46.021
I told you we all out
and Eddie ain't gonna give us more,

26:46.104 --> 26:48.106
since we still owe him
for last fuckin' week.

26:48.356 --> 26:49.357
Well, fuck Eddie!

26:49.441 --> 26:51.026
We'll get it from someone else.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.777
That guy under the bridge.

26:53.570 --> 26:55.280
The fuck do I have him in here as?

26:55.530 --> 26:56.865
Here he is. "Guy Under Bridge."

26:56.948 --> 26:58.533
Hey!

26:59.075 --> 27:01.911
Forget the pills. I can get my hands
on something better.

27:02.537 --> 27:03.955
Unless you're afraid of needles.

27:05.415 --> 27:08.168
Err... Whatever you can get.
Just go, get it.

27:08.543 --> 27:09.961
-Yeah?
-Yeah. Go.

27:16.343 --> 27:17.177
Hey.

27:17.552 --> 27:19.429
Hey! Did you get your cow?

27:21.306 --> 27:22.140
Yeah.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.184
Well, got her all taken care of.

27:25.727 --> 27:26.603
Where's everyone?

27:26.853 --> 27:29.481
They all went to Maggie's to get a drink.
[chuckles]

27:29.814 --> 27:32.692
Your mom texted Joanne
and said all the drinks were on her

27:32.776 --> 27:34.944
'cause now she's married to Beau,
she gonna need 'em.

27:36.446 --> 27:39.157
[Abby chuckles]

27:42.369 --> 27:43.203
Where's Peyton?

27:43.495 --> 27:44.704
She's inside sleepin'.

27:46.414 --> 27:47.540
You missed the cake.

27:48.249 --> 27:50.794
Joanne got the bakery to make
a Mount Rushmore cake

27:50.877 --> 27:52.420
but with four Reagans.

27:55.048 --> 27:57.550
Oh! Turned out to be a bad idea, though,

27:57.634 --> 27:59.594
'cause Beau wouldn't let anyone
cut into it.

27:59.678 --> 28:02.764
-[Colt chuckles]
-[Abby laughs] Oh.

28:03.765 --> 28:05.517
The wedding was awesome, wasn't it?

28:07.227 --> 28:08.061
Yeah.

28:10.647 --> 28:12.357
Made me think about our wedding.

28:15.235 --> 28:17.070
How I still wanna make this work.

28:23.284 --> 28:24.744
I ain't going to counseling.

28:26.913 --> 28:28.915
[inhales and sighs]

28:29.040 --> 28:29.874
W...

28:30.458 --> 28:31.292
Why?

28:32.711 --> 28:33.670
Ain't no point.

28:34.212 --> 28:35.088
Okay.

28:35.797 --> 28:38.007
They're just gonna tell me
I shouldna lied.

28:38.425 --> 28:39.259
You know what?

28:40.802 --> 28:41.928
I lied to protect you.

28:43.471 --> 28:44.305
I'd do it again.

28:45.807 --> 28:47.350
I don't wanna be protected.

28:48.893 --> 28:49.853
I want a partner.

28:50.770 --> 28:52.772
I want you to always tell me the truth.

28:57.610 --> 28:59.446
I just blew up Neumann's Hill's dam.

29:03.950 --> 29:05.994
-Jesus, Colt!
-Sh. Wanted the truth.

29:06.786 --> 29:08.872
That's where me and Luke went.

29:09.539 --> 29:11.499
Do you know... what coulda happened?

29:12.292 --> 29:15.587
Huh? I know you're desperate
but this is just fucking stupid!

29:16.421 --> 29:18.590
Ain't nobody ever accused me
of being smart.

29:21.634 --> 29:23.136
I guess that's just who I am.

29:25.096 --> 29:27.390
Somebody who fights
for what they care about.

29:29.058 --> 29:31.519
Sometimes that makes me do
stupid, crazy shit.

29:33.730 --> 29:35.815
Like... blowin' up a dam.

29:36.941 --> 29:39.110
Or painting "I love you" on a water tower.

29:39.819 --> 29:41.613
Or proposing in a drunk tank.

29:43.448 --> 29:45.575
-You used to love that about me.
-I still...

29:46.034 --> 29:48.953
love that about you
but there is a difference, okay,

29:49.078 --> 29:53.458
between being impulsive and doing
something dangerous and illegal.

29:53.541 --> 29:56.211
Well if you're gonna accept me,
you gotta accept all of me.

29:58.171 --> 29:59.506
Maybe you just never have.

30:00.006 --> 30:00.882
[sighs]

30:01.883 --> 30:03.009
Look, I ain't perfect.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.804
Neither are you.
I ain't trying to change you.

30:05.887 --> 30:07.472
This isn't about trying to change you.

30:07.555 --> 30:10.558
It's about raising our daughter
in a safe and stable home.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.227
You don't think I want that?

30:12.310 --> 30:14.687
If you told me you wanted
to be together right now,

30:14.979 --> 30:15.855
I would do it!

30:16.314 --> 30:17.982
Even though
it's probably a huge mistake,

30:18.066 --> 30:20.276
'cause I'll spend my whole life
walkin' on eggshells

30:20.360 --> 30:22.070
worried about my... next mistake,

30:22.237 --> 30:24.113
that'll probably be the one
that makes you leave.

30:24.197 --> 30:25.949
I don't want you to live like that. OK?

30:26.032 --> 30:28.368
That's why, hopefully,
if we keep working on it,

30:28.451 --> 30:29.953
-we could go back--
-Hopefully?!

30:30.036 --> 30:31.454
-Yes!
-Are you kidding me?

30:31.996 --> 30:33.373
We were just at a wedding!

30:33.748 --> 30:35.750
Where two people swore to each other

30:35.834 --> 30:38.503
that they'll stay with each other,
no matter what!

30:38.586 --> 30:40.171
And you say "hopefully"...

30:40.630 --> 30:41.631
we can make it work.

30:43.591 --> 30:44.592
Joanne just told my dad

30:44.676 --> 30:45.844
she's got Alzheimer's.

30:46.594 --> 30:47.554
And my dad,

30:48.346 --> 30:49.347
he didn't waver.

30:50.139 --> 30:52.016
Not for one second.

30:52.725 --> 30:54.769
But we have one fight... One...

30:55.311 --> 30:58.523
two months into our marriage,
and we don't even live together?

31:02.861 --> 31:04.946
So now you're calling my feelings stupid?

31:05.238 --> 31:06.364
Jesus Christ!

31:07.699 --> 31:09.325
[Abby] Mm, that's helpful.

31:09.617 --> 31:11.744
I don't think anything's helpful
right now.

31:11.828 --> 31:12.704
[laughs sarcastically]

31:13.580 --> 31:14.914
That's great to hear from a guy

31:14.998 --> 31:17.417
who says he fights for everything
he cares about.

31:20.253 --> 31:21.504
Maybe I'm done fightin'.

31:22.964 --> 31:25.258
-[quietly] OK.
-I think we should get a divorce.
