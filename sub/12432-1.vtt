00:42.609 --> 00:44.941
<i>These are the legends.</i>

00:45.011 --> 00:47.007
<i>You've heard
about them for years.</i>

00:47.113 --> 00:49.948
<i>The pretty housewife-</i>
<i>you know the one.</i>

00:50.016 --> 00:52.951
<i>The friends burst in at the surprise party,</i>
<i>find her spread eagle...</i>

00:53.019 --> 00:56.819
<i>with the family dog licking peanut
butter from between her legs.</i>

00:56.890 --> 00:58.289
<i>Well, she's real.</i>

00:58.358 --> 01:01.350
<i>Remember the cheerleader?</i>
<i>She gets her stomach pumped.</i>

01:01.428 --> 01:04.659
- <i>They find a quart of sperm. Her name's Luann.</i>
- Hey.

01:04.730 --> 01:08.758
<i>They may not look like much to you,</i>
<i>but they were all-stars on the circuit.</i>

01:08.835 --> 01:11.201
<i>The hooker reunites</i>
<i>with the john here...</i>

01:11.271 --> 01:13.102
<i>the molester with the molested.</i>

01:14.374 --> 01:16.467
<i>The guy hanging naked</i>
<i>from the shower curtain rod...</i>

01:16.543 --> 01:20.445
<i>half dead from
autoerotic asphyxiation?</i>

01:20.513 --> 01:23.448
- Hi. My name is Lonnie, and I'm a sex addict.
- <i>He's Lonnie. He's a sex addict.</i>

01:23.516 --> 01:25.882
Hi, Lonnie.

01:25.952 --> 01:28.978
<i>These people are the reason</i>
<i>emergency rooms have special tools...</i>

01:29.055 --> 01:32.957
<i>to remove the champagne bottle,</i>
<i>the fluorescent bulb, the hamster.</i>

01:33.026 --> 01:35.756
- Did you ever experience-
- <i>For the freaks in here, sex is a compulsion...</i>

01:35.829 --> 01:39.128
- <i>like gambling, or drugs, or shoplifting.</i>
- Hi. My name is Agnes.

01:39.199 --> 01:41.565
<i>At least this one
looks like love...</i>

01:41.634 --> 01:43.534
<i>if you squint.</i>

01:43.603 --> 01:45.537
<i>That's my best friend, Denny.</i>

01:45.605 --> 01:48.130
<i>Denny showed up here after
he got booted from art school...</i>

01:48.208 --> 01:51.075
<i>for waxing his weasel</i>
<i>during life drawing class.</i>

01:51.144 --> 01:53.112
<i>Not like the model was even fine.</i>

01:53.179 --> 01:55.909
<i>Just some old hippie</i>
<i>with overgrown nature bush.</i>

01:55.982 --> 02:01.420
<i>But Denny didn't care. By then he was</i>
<i>masturbating 15 times a day just to break even.</i>

02:01.488 --> 02:03.820
<i>Got so he could barely</i>
<i>make a fist anymore.</i>

02:03.890 --> 02:08.452
<i>Nico gets released from the halfway
house twice a week for therapy...</i>

02:08.527 --> 02:10.461
<i>just like Cinderella.</i>

02:10.530 --> 02:13.158
<i>Only at midnight</i>
<i>she turns into a fugitive.</i>

02:14.667 --> 02:16.931
<i>Don't get me wrong-
I'm no different.</i>

02:17.003 --> 02:18.994
<i>We're all here for
the same reason:</i>

02:19.072 --> 02:23.406
<i>to dig through our personal valise</i>
<i>of perverse, heartbreaking memories...</i>

02:23.476 --> 02:27.606
<i>until we find one that helps us</i>
<i>to break the cycle, to get sober.</i>

02:27.680 --> 02:31.707
<i>For me, that means no more constant</i>
<i>meaningless sex with strangers...</i>

02:31.784 --> 02:33.911
<i>all the time.</i>

02:33.987 --> 02:36.512
<i>I come to meetings.</i>
<i>I work the steps.</i>

02:36.589 --> 02:38.580
<i>I even try to abstain.</i>

02:38.658 --> 02:42.355
<i>So far, it's not going so well.</i>

02:44.964 --> 02:47.728
- <i>Not that it's any picnic to quit.</i>
- Sign this.

02:47.800 --> 02:51.361
<i>Sex addicts become literally dependent
on the rush of constant sex.</i>

02:51.437 --> 02:53.598
Around the world, Nico.
Around the world, baby.

02:53.673 --> 02:56.870
<i>Orgasms release endorphins.</i>
<i>Endorphins kill pain.</i>

02:56.943 --> 02:58.877
<i>And I'm all for that.</i>

02:58.945 --> 03:00.537
- You got something to write with?
- <i>In my pocket.</i>

03:00.613 --> 03:04.777
<i>Hold on a second. I'm Nico's sponsor,</i>
<i>and I take that very seriously.</i>

03:04.851 --> 03:07.649
Here you go, babe.

03:07.720 --> 03:10.280
<i>I mean, please,</i>
<i>even the worst blow job is better...</i>

03:10.356 --> 03:15.259
<i>than, say, sniffing the greatest rose</i>
<i>or watching the greatest sunset.</i>

03:15.328 --> 03:17.319
<i>But I'm not thinking
about that now...</i>

03:17.397 --> 03:20.423
<i>because at any moment I won't
have a problem in the world.</i>

03:20.500 --> 03:23.492
<i>No bills, no stupid job,
no crazy mother.</i>

03:23.570 --> 03:27.404
<i>All I'm going to feel is perfect,</i>
<i>beautiful nothing.</i>

03:27.473 --> 03:30.306
Fuck you! Not yet.

03:36.082 --> 03:38.482
<i>Here it comes. Perfect.</i>

03:38.551 --> 03:41.543
- <i>Beautiful.</i>
- Fu-

03:45.091 --> 03:47.025
Keep coming back.

03:47.093 --> 03:49.960
It works if you work it,
so work it, you're worth it.

03:50.029 --> 03:51.462
Yeah.

03:58.838 --> 04:00.999
What'd you say you do again?

04:01.207 --> 04:05.007
I am the backbone
of colonial America.

04:05.078 --> 04:09.037
- Welcome to the Village of Dunsboro.
- Come on, kids.

04:09.115 --> 04:12.778
Here, life in an 18th-century settlement
is re-created in vivid detail.

04:12.852 --> 04:14.820
Here. Take it.

04:14.887 --> 04:16.036
<i> For some,</i>
<i>it's more vivid than others.</i>

04:16.036 --> 04:17.185
Bye-bye.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.190
<i>Not that you can blame 'em.</i>

04:19.259 --> 04:22.490
<i>We're all marooned here</i>
<i>like castaways on some TVshow...</i>

04:22.562 --> 04:24.860
<i>who never age and never escape.</i>

04:24.931 --> 04:27.422
<i>Think Gilligan meets</i>
Groundhog Day...

04:27.500 --> 04:29.730
<i>in hell.</i>

04:29.802 --> 04:32.965
Hmm. Can I get a turn?

04:33.039 --> 04:35.701
- Sure you can.
- When?

04:35.775 --> 04:38.642
When the <i>Mayglower</i>
sails out of my ass.

04:38.711 --> 04:40.645
- Hey, kids.
- Nice.

04:40.713 --> 04:44.809
- <i> Ooh.</i>
- Hi. All right. Watch this. Ready?

04:44.884 --> 04:46.875
<i>Whoa, you've got skills.</i>

04:46.953 --> 04:50.047
<i>How do you know how to do that?</i>

04:58.898 --> 05:03.062
- <i> Get off me. Aah!</i>
- Hey, man. What the-

05:04.671 --> 05:06.662
Hey, get out of here, you little shits!

05:06.739 --> 05:08.900
Easy, easy, easy.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.671
It's me. It's me.

05:11.744 --> 05:13.974
- Sorry, dude.
- You all right?

05:14.047 --> 05:17.278
Yeah, these kids kept putting
this ferret thing down my pants.

05:17.350 --> 05:19.341
Am I bleeding?

05:19.419 --> 05:21.751
- Oh, God.
- What? What is it?

05:21.821 --> 05:24.517
Ursula, man.

05:24.590 --> 05:28.424
- <i> She's a milkmaid.</i>
- You got that right.

05:28.494 --> 05:30.121
<i>No.</i>

05:30.196 --> 05:31.720
<i>No.</i>

05:31.798 --> 05:33.561
<i>Yeah.</i>

05:33.633 --> 05:35.601
<i>She's milking those
cows all day...</i>

05:35.668 --> 05:39.764
<i>working those fingers up and down</i>
<i>and up and down and up and down.</i>

05:39.839 --> 05:42.808
- Hey! Hey, hey, man!
- Thanks.

05:42.875 --> 05:46.072
- <i>Yeah, you may not want to do that.</i>
- Ursula?

05:46.145 --> 05:48.670
Hi.

05:48.748 --> 05:51.410
<i>Look at this guy.</i>

05:51.484 --> 05:53.111
Man's a glutton for punishment.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.654
<i> She laughed.</i>

05:55.722 --> 05:58.247
- Did you see that?
- "At," dude, not "with."

05:58.324 --> 06:00.417
<i>Right.</i>

06:06.165 --> 06:08.531
Oh, shit. Let's roll.

06:09.569 --> 06:11.833
Wait, wait. Where is it? Fuck.

06:11.904 --> 06:14.805
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I need my wig. Where's my wig?

06:14.874 --> 06:17.968
- Leave the goddamn wig, will you?
- Dude, he'll dock me.

06:19.345 --> 06:22.075
- Who hast released thee from thy bonds?
- My bonds?

06:22.148 --> 06:24.446
Thou knowest the rules.

06:24.517 --> 06:27.179
Miscreants may be freed only by a duly
appointed member of the constabulary.

06:27.253 --> 06:29.187
Give it a rest with the olden spiel,
Charlie.

06:29.255 --> 06:31.189
You heard the bells. We're off.

06:31.257 --> 06:33.987
- And what of his uncovered pate?
- My what?

06:34.060 --> 06:37.052
Your pate! Your pate.

06:37.130 --> 06:41.191
Discarding period attire whilst within
colony walls is a clear violation of character.

06:41.267 --> 06:43.963
Fine. Okay? You happy?

06:44.036 --> 06:47.938
- Thy purse shall suffer for thy transgressions.
- Hey, hey, hey, look.

06:48.007 --> 06:52.034
<i>I don't mind if you wanna play method Mussolini</i>
<i>to this bunch of failed drama school rejects...</i>

06:52.111 --> 06:55.342
- but you dock my check one more time-
- Victor.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.940
thou wilt feel the wrath
of a fuckin' beat-down.

06:58.017 --> 07:01.316
- Bring it then, varlet, if thou be a man.
- Victor! Victor!

07:01.387 --> 07:03.378
- What wilt thou do?
- What am I gonna do? What? What?

07:03.456 --> 07:05.617
- What sayest thou?
- It's the last bus.

07:07.326 --> 07:09.317
- What wilt thou do?
- Oh!

07:09.395 --> 07:11.329
- Come on.
- All right. Let's go. Come on.

07:11.397 --> 07:14.696
- Where dost thou go?
- Let's go.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.701
Fuckin' knave.

07:16.769 --> 07:20.500
<i> # Years ago I lost my guard</i>
<i>Ever since it's been hard #</i>

07:20.573 --> 07:22.803
<i># Standing up like a man #</i>

07:22.875 --> 07:24.809
<i># Like a father</i>
<i>Understand #</i>

07:24.877 --> 07:27.607
<i># That all I do is not enough #</i>

07:27.680 --> 07:29.944
- <i># For myself I am tough #
- Dude, where is this place?</i>

07:30.016 --> 07:32.416
- It's coming up.
- <i># On myself I need to freeze #</i>

07:32.485 --> 07:34.544
- Here.
- <i># I need direction, ah, please #</i>

07:34.620 --> 07:37.919
<i># Show me all the rules, girl #</i>

07:37.990 --> 07:40.083
- <i># I just wanna get 'em wrong ##</i>
- Thank you.

07:50.069 --> 07:54.165
Can't we just this once enjoy
a nice meal like normal people?

07:54.240 --> 07:56.800
No.

07:56.876 --> 07:59.606
- You can't fool people into loving you.
- Wanna bet?

08:09.121 --> 08:11.055
<i>Somebody saves your life...</i>

08:11.123 --> 08:13.956
<i>they'll love you forever.</i>

08:14.026 --> 08:16.859
<i>It's like the old Chinese custom.</i>

08:16.929 --> 08:19.557
<i>They feel responsible.</i>

08:19.632 --> 08:23.090
<i>They'll write.</i>
<i>They'll send birthday cards.</i>

08:23.169 --> 08:27.230
<i>Play it right, even cash.</i>

08:27.306 --> 08:32.140
<i>Unless you let yourself get rescued by</i>
<i>some busboy who brings down 350 a week.</i>

08:33.779 --> 08:36.246
<i>Hey! That's mine.</i>

08:36.315 --> 08:38.977
<i>So, who's it gonna be tonight?</i>

08:39.051 --> 08:42.214
<i>How 'bout you, honey?</i>
<i>You feeling heroic?</i>

08:42.288 --> 08:44.313
<i>Uh-oh. Swatch.</i>

08:44.390 --> 08:46.483
<i>Okay. Come on!</i>

08:46.559 --> 08:51.292
<i>There he is. You and me,</i>
<i>we're about to be friends for life.</i>

08:51.364 --> 08:53.144
Come on. Come on, come on.

08:53.145 --> 08:54.925
<i>Who knows? This might be</i>
<i>the greatest day of their lives.</i>

08:56.519 --> 08:59.836
<i>One heroic deed that justifies</i>
<i>their entire existence.</i>

09:01.674 --> 09:05.235
<i>They grab you and hold you.</i>

09:05.311 --> 09:08.041
<i>They rock you softly
in their arms.</i>

09:08.114 --> 09:10.605
All right. It's gonna be all right.

09:11.817 --> 09:14.980
<i>And before you know it,</i>
<i>you're their child.</i>

09:15.054 --> 09:17.022
- You're okay.
- <i>You belong to them.</i>

09:17.089 --> 09:19.421
Yeah.

09:21.127 --> 09:24.528
- Okay.
- <i>You see this? This is my favorite part.</i>

09:30.703 --> 09:32.637
- Hey, Kim.
- <i>Hi, Victor.</i>

09:32.705 --> 09:35.469
- How art thou?
- That's funny.

09:35.541 --> 09:37.873
- That's very funny.
- Proceed.

09:43.916 --> 09:46.441
<i>Mrs. Novak is an undresser.</i>

09:46.519 --> 09:49.420
<i>That's why she gets
the special pantsuit.</i>

09:50.856 --> 09:54.121
<i>Other patients express themselves</i>
<i>through art...</i>

09:54.193 --> 09:56.127
<i>which can also be disturbing.</i>

09:57.263 --> 10:00.960
<i>Eva here is what
you call a squirrel.</i>

10:01.033 --> 10:03.501
Colin? Oh, Colin, is that you?

10:03.569 --> 10:05.503
What do we have tonight, Eva?

10:05.571 --> 10:07.368
<i>Hmm. Roast beef.</i>

10:07.440 --> 10:09.738
That's not doing you any good
in there, now, is it?

10:09.809 --> 10:12.573
You hurt me, Colin.
You hurt me, and I'm telling Mother.

10:12.645 --> 10:15.580
- That might prove challenging.
- You touched my woo-woo.

10:15.648 --> 10:18.845
I definitely did not touch
your woo-woo.

10:18.918 --> 10:22.183
<i> If it wasn't for that chip in her bracelet,
she'd follow me around all night...</i>

10:22.254 --> 10:24.484
<i>squawking about her poor woo-woo.</i>

10:24.557 --> 10:29.051
<i>St. Anthony's is what you call</i>
<i>a constant care facility.</i>

10:29.128 --> 10:31.722
<i>It's for loony broads of all ages.</i>

10:31.797 --> 10:34.265
<i>But mostly,</i>
<i>it's where grannies get dumped.</i>

10:37.136 --> 10:39.570
<i>You see that look
she just gave me?</i>

10:39.639 --> 10:41.903
<i>That's 'cause that
really happened.</i>

10:41.974 --> 10:44.738
<i>Guess you could say</i>
<i>I'm kinda tight with the staff.</i>

10:44.810 --> 10:47.472
<i>Hello. Who are you?</i>

10:47.546 --> 10:50.037
<i>Oh, that's right.</i>
<i>You're gonna ruin everything.</i>

10:51.350 --> 10:54.217
<i>But of course,
I don't know that yet.</i>

10:55.354 --> 10:57.288
Well, it's about time.

10:57.356 --> 11:00.621
She's been asking for you all day.
Wouldn't take a bite until you got here.

11:00.693 --> 11:02.957
- Who am I today?
- Some guy named Fred.

11:03.029 --> 11:05.589
- Sounds like another one of the lawyers.
- He was.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.463
- "Was"?
- Fred's dead. Aortic aneurysm.

11:08.534 --> 11:11.526
- Fall of'97.
- You forgetting something?

11:11.604 --> 11:13.629
Oh.

11:13.706 --> 11:15.640
- So, you good?
- Yeah.

11:16.942 --> 11:19.376
Well, my lady,
I'll see you later. Okay?

11:19.445 --> 11:21.379
Okay.

11:28.654 --> 11:31.714
That's nice.
Hey, where's Constance?

11:31.791 --> 11:34.282
Upstairs.
They took her this morning.

11:34.360 --> 11:37.659
Oh. Well, she'll be back.

11:37.730 --> 11:39.755
Oh, no, she won't, Fred.

11:39.832 --> 11:43.233
They take you up to the second floor,
you don't come back.

11:43.302 --> 11:46.499
But they take you up to the third floor,
you'd just better hope your plot's paid up.

11:46.572 --> 11:49.302
I got... cannelloni!

11:49.375 --> 11:52.538
- Huh?
- Will you get that out of my face?

11:52.611 --> 11:57.548
You're just like my son, Victor, always trying
to shove some inedible mosh down my throat.

11:57.616 --> 11:59.811
I thought you liked Italian.

11:59.885 --> 12:02.945
You gotta eat, you know.

12:03.022 --> 12:04.990
You gotta-

12:07.393 --> 12:11.090
Oh, it's you!

12:14.066 --> 12:16.000
What happened, Fred?

12:18.671 --> 12:21.162
You used to cut quite the dashing figure.
Now look at you.

12:21.240 --> 12:24.698
You look like my son, Victor,
the minimum wage tour guide.

12:24.777 --> 12:29.009
- He's not a tour guide.
- Well, something menial or irrelevant like that.

12:29.081 --> 12:32.608
You know what he did?
He dropped out of medical school.

12:32.685 --> 12:34.448
- Did you know that?
- I heard.

12:34.520 --> 12:37.512
Now he's so busy ruining his life,
he doesn't have time to visit his mother.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.649
That's disgraceful.

12:39.725 --> 12:43.422
When I think what I went through to give
that boy some vision, to open his eyes.

12:43.496 --> 12:46.124
And do you know how he repays me?
You know what he did?

12:46.198 --> 12:48.666
- He had me committed-
- Isn't Victor supporting you?

12:48.734 --> 12:50.702
Who told you that?

12:50.770 --> 12:52.704
I heard he dropped out
of medical school...

12:52.772 --> 12:54.967
just so you could move into
an expensive private hospital.

12:55.040 --> 12:58.373
Didn't I hear something like that? Huh?

12:58.444 --> 13:00.378
Look, there's my show.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.539
And I got a feelin'
Victor might visit more often...

13:02.615 --> 13:06.312
if you didn't spend all your time
talking to a bunch of dead lawyers.

13:06.385 --> 13:10.253
- Huh?
- Oh, you'll never change, Fred.

13:10.322 --> 13:12.813
You're always defending
the hopelessly guilty.

13:12.892 --> 13:16.328
<i>That's not how you drown a cat.</i>

13:23.302 --> 13:27.329
<i>You're in a hospital.</i>
<i>Dr. Blue is called on the intercom.</i>

13:27.406 --> 13:29.966
- Uh, that means somebody stopped breathing.
- Good.

13:30.042 --> 13:33.443
- Pamela Cosgrove paged in an airport.
- Oh, I know this one.

13:33.512 --> 13:36.037
- Quick, quick, quick.
- I know this one. Terrorist with a gun.

13:36.115 --> 13:39.676
Terrilynn Mayfield,
please pick up a courtesy phone.

13:39.752 --> 13:41.947
Uh, nerve gas?

13:42.021 --> 13:46.481
- Think cows and horses.
- Oh, anthrax. Why am I so stupid?

13:46.559 --> 13:49.551
That's all right. Learn half these names,
you'll live longer than most.

13:49.628 --> 13:51.892
Forget what
some foster family teaches you.

13:51.964 --> 13:53.955
These fake people are all that matter.

13:55.634 --> 13:58.603
- What is it?
- <i>It's a playground.</i>

13:58.671 --> 14:02.038
- Could we go over there?
- Why on earth would we do that?

14:03.509 --> 14:07.502
Mmm, just to swing and stuff,
like normal people.

14:07.580 --> 14:09.707
We have to keep moving, honey.

14:09.782 --> 14:14.685
If we stopped at every playground we came
across, we'd never get anything done.

14:14.753 --> 14:16.744
Eat your supper.

14:36.675 --> 14:39.075
<i>What are you supposed to be?</i>

14:40.713 --> 14:43.477
Oh, I'm the backbone of colonial America.

14:43.549 --> 14:46.985
- Which is?
- An Irish indentured servant.

14:47.052 --> 14:50.419
- <i>Where's Dr. Fielding?</i>
- Gone. Retired.

14:50.489 --> 14:52.980
- Are you in charge of my mother?
- Name?

14:53.058 --> 14:55.253
- Victor.
- Hers?

14:55.327 --> 14:58.626
Oh. Um, Ida Mancini.

14:58.697 --> 15:00.665
- You're the son.
- Yeah.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.725
- The tour guide.
- I'm not a tour guide.

15:03.802 --> 15:05.793
I'm a historical interpreter.

15:05.871 --> 15:08.396
Okay.

15:08.474 --> 15:10.465
How come you never visit?

15:10.542 --> 15:12.635
I visit all the time, just not as myself.

15:12.711 --> 15:16.613
Kind of defeats the purpose,
don't you think?

15:16.682 --> 15:18.673
She's an amazing woman, your mother.

15:18.751 --> 15:22.312
- Yeah. Listen, Dr. -
- Marshall. Dr. Paige Marshall.

15:22.388 --> 15:24.379
Hi. She's getting worse.

15:24.456 --> 15:27.118
She-She never knows who I am anymore
and now she won't eat.

15:27.192 --> 15:30.286
- Even when the lawyer comes to visit?
- There's no lawyer.

15:30.362 --> 15:33.422
I'm the lawyer. Today she spat out
cannelloni from Cicero's.

15:33.499 --> 15:35.490
That's like her death row favorite meal.

15:35.567 --> 15:37.899
I've seen her sprint 10 blocks in heels
just to steal it.

15:37.970 --> 15:40.871
We're reaching the point
where decisions have to be made.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.170
Decisions?
What do you mean, decisions?

15:43.242 --> 15:45.472
<i>Dr. Marshall!</i>

15:47.046 --> 15:49.674
- You'll have to excuse me now.
- Hey, hey.

15:49.748 --> 15:53.149
Could we go somewhere and talk,
you know, about my mother and stuff?

15:53.218 --> 15:55.584
- Now?
- Or later.

15:55.654 --> 15:58.714
We could meet for a drink
or, uh-you know.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.918
Are you asking me out?

16:00.993 --> 16:05.657
Well, no. Sort of. I mean, yeah.

16:05.731 --> 16:08.723
I have to finish my rounds now,
Mr. Mancini.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.133
We'll talk again on your next visit.

16:11.203 --> 16:13.797
But-

16:14.006 --> 16:17.407
- <i> These are your grandparents, right?</i>
- Um, I guess so, yeah.

16:17.476 --> 16:20.502
- I never met them.
- Why do they look like that?

16:20.579 --> 16:23.878
- They're Italian.
- Like, from Italy?

16:23.949 --> 16:26.281
Yeah.

16:26.352 --> 16:29.287
<i>Uh, Mom came for boarding school</i>
<i>and never went back.</i>

16:29.355 --> 16:31.846
Ah. Look at her here.

16:34.693 --> 16:38.185
Wow. She was really,
really, really, really-

16:38.263 --> 16:41.061
Hey, hey! What the fuck!

16:41.133 --> 16:44.068
- <i>Dude! That's my mom.</i>
- I'm sorry, dude.

16:44.136 --> 16:46.627
- <i> It's just, she was hot.</i>
- No.

16:46.705 --> 16:50.801
Here. Make yourself useful.

16:50.876 --> 16:52.400
Man.

16:52.478 --> 16:54.844
"Dear Victor...

16:54.913 --> 16:57.245
"sorry to hear about your gums.

16:57.316 --> 16:59.216
"Hope this will help.

16:59.284 --> 17:01.548
Your pal, Bennett."

17:01.620 --> 17:04.646
- Who's Bennett?
- You met him. Sizzler on Western.

17:04.723 --> 17:07.624
<i>Oh, yeah. Big guy?</i>
<i>Nearly broke a rib?</i>

17:07.693 --> 17:10.127
That's him. How much?

17:10.194 --> 17:14.290
Uh, 32.

17:14.366 --> 17:17.164
<i>Dollars? Thirty-two dollars?</i>

17:17.236 --> 17:20.069
You know what $32 gets you
at a periodontist these days?

17:20.138 --> 17:22.573
- Why? What's wrong with your gums?
- Nothin'.

17:22.641 --> 17:25.804
- I'm just saying, if there was.
- You're healthy.

17:25.877 --> 17:28.108
Let me explain something to you.
I provide a service.

17:28.180 --> 17:30.842
They send some cash.
It renews their savior experience.

17:30.916 --> 17:34.682
It's like when you adopt an overseas orphan,
only I'm right here.

17:34.753 --> 17:38.086
<i>Besides, if I don't come up</i>
<i>with my monthly three grand...</i>

17:38.157 --> 17:40.853
those vipers at St. Anthony's
won't let me in to feed her.

17:40.926 --> 17:42.689
- Fuck!
- What?

17:42.761 --> 17:44.251
I'm light.

17:44.329 --> 17:46.991
Again, Mr. Mancini?

17:47.066 --> 17:49.762
<i>You're light again.</i>

17:49.835 --> 17:51.996
Not to worry.

17:52.071 --> 17:57.475
I'm sure there's room
at the new state facility in Clancy.

17:57.543 --> 18:00.512
I hear they do a lovely porridge.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.979
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

18:04.450 --> 18:07.476
You got a pen?

18:12.624 --> 18:15.286
God bless you, Mr. Mancini.

18:22.835 --> 18:25.998
Come on.
It's eggplant parm from Gallini's.

18:26.071 --> 18:28.733
You love their eggplant. One bite.

18:28.807 --> 18:31.605
I'm not hungry.

18:31.677 --> 18:35.408
So, what are you doing? What's-
What's going on? Why are you-

18:35.481 --> 18:37.415
You're crying.

18:38.750 --> 18:41.810
What do you expect, Artie?
I'm dying.

18:41.887 --> 18:44.253
You're not dying. You're not dying.

18:44.323 --> 18:46.314
<i>For Pete's sake, look at me.</i>

18:46.391 --> 18:51.385
Half the time I don't even know
who I'm talking to anymore.

18:51.463 --> 18:54.261
Fine. Whatever.

18:54.333 --> 18:57.325
I've had enough
of this ridiculous planet.

19:00.005 --> 19:01.996
It's Victor.

19:03.775 --> 19:05.766
I can't bear it.

19:07.412 --> 19:11.109
- He has to know.
- Know what?

19:11.183 --> 19:13.208
Who he comes from.

19:13.285 --> 19:16.584
You said his father was a traveling
salesman from Norway with Tourette's.

19:16.655 --> 19:20.284
- I had to tell him something.
- You mean-You mean he's not?

19:20.359 --> 19:22.384
Of course he's not.

19:24.363 --> 19:27.423
You, uh-

19:27.499 --> 19:29.831
You have to tell him the truth, Ida.

19:29.902 --> 19:31.893
He's got a right to know.

19:31.970 --> 19:34.530
I've been trying for months now...

19:34.606 --> 19:39.543
but he so rarely comes to visit, and when
he does, I can't bring myself to say it.

19:39.611 --> 19:42.079
Listen to me now, Ida.

19:42.147 --> 19:45.275
It's very important that Victor
knows who he comes from...

19:45.350 --> 19:47.818
other than just, you know...

19:47.886 --> 19:49.820
you.

19:49.888 --> 19:51.981
- You really think so?
- Absolutely.

19:52.057 --> 19:55.049
Let me call him. I bet you
I could get him here lickety-split.

19:55.127 --> 19:57.058
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no.
I couldn't face that. No.

19:57.059 --> 19:57.789
Well-

19:57.863 --> 20:01.594
You can tell me then.
I won't say a word.

20:01.667 --> 20:03.897
Attorney-client privilege and all.

20:03.969 --> 20:06.631
But, Artie, I really can't do that.

20:06.705 --> 20:08.639
Why not?

20:10.609 --> 20:14.238
 'Cause I'm not even sure who you really are.

20:16.782 --> 20:20.047
<i>Oh, I'm sorry, Artie.</i>
<i>I have to go.</i>

20:21.486 --> 20:23.716
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Hi, Tito.

20:28.927 --> 20:31.691
Do you think she'll take you back?
She won't, you know.

20:31.763 --> 20:35.221
Pretty women
are narcissistic and unforgiving.

20:35.300 --> 20:37.234
You're pretty.

20:38.904 --> 20:42.135
I might have known.
You're too weak. You're too ordinary.

20:42.207 --> 20:45.040
This work requires vision.
It requires fortitude.

20:45.110 --> 20:47.305
What work?
You don't do any work.

20:47.379 --> 20:50.109
All you do is get in trouble.

20:50.182 --> 20:52.480
Don't you see? You are my work.

20:52.551 --> 20:55.042
All the political acts,
all the subversive happenings-

20:55.120 --> 20:57.213
They're all designed
to- to open your eyes.

20:57.289 --> 21:01.020
- Where's my father?
- Well, he's probably back in Oslo by now...

21:01.093 --> 21:04.654
offending his poor customers
with those unfortunate outbursts.

21:04.730 --> 21:06.994
I want to see him.

21:07.065 --> 21:10.557
He doesn't want you, Victor.
Why do you think he left?

21:13.705 --> 21:15.900
<i>We need to talk.</i>

21:15.974 --> 21:19.375
I think it's time we consider
a move to the second floor.

21:19.444 --> 21:22.675
The second floor?
No. Absolutely not.

21:22.748 --> 21:25.410
Mr. Mancini, your mother suffers
from a form of dementia...

21:25.484 --> 21:28.317
that's been exacerbated
by years of substance abuse.

21:28.387 --> 21:30.082
Dr. Fielding said it was Alzheimer's.

21:30.155 --> 21:33.886
There's a reason Dr. Fielding's
playing mini golf in Boca right now.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.950
Can we walk?

21:37.896 --> 21:39.921
Hey, did you try Aricept or Cognex?

21:39.998 --> 21:42.228
How would you know
about those drugs, Mr. Mancini?

21:42.301 --> 21:44.633
What about a glutamine blocker
like Memantine?

21:44.703 --> 21:48.537
We've tried everything. Once they've
stopped eating, the course is fairly predictable.

21:48.607 --> 21:51.405
Couldn't you force-feed her?
I'd be happy to help.

21:51.476 --> 21:53.535
I understand how you feel.

21:53.612 --> 21:57.514
Facing the possibility of a loved one's
demise can be very traumatic.

21:57.582 --> 22:01.518
Oh, no. I want her to die, just not
until I find out who my family is.

22:01.586 --> 22:04.578
Perhaps we should talk later
when you're not so upset.

22:04.656 --> 22:06.714
You're absolutely right.
What time do you get off?

22:06.715 --> 22:07.682
You don't have to do that.

22:07.759 --> 22:09.624
- What?
- Try to have sex with me.

22:09.695 --> 22:11.560
Oh, I really do.

22:11.630 --> 22:14.565
Well, I suppose that's flattering,
but I think we'd better not.

22:14.633 --> 22:19.263
- Why?
- Because you're just sad and lonely maybe.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.602
<i>And you're realizing for the first
time that your mother...</i>

22:21.673 --> 22:24.836
probably won't be getting better.

22:24.910 --> 22:27.970
And sleeping with me isn't gonna
change any of that, now, is it?

22:29.047 --> 22:30.947
Only one way to find out.

22:31.016 --> 22:32.916
Good night, Mr. Mancini.

22:34.820 --> 22:37.311
Hey.

22:37.389 --> 22:40.449
There's a little piece missing
from your ear.

22:40.525 --> 22:42.584
- I was clawed.
- Clawed?

22:42.661 --> 22:44.151
- <i>By what?</i>
- A lynx.

22:44.229 --> 22:45.753
- A lynx?
- It's like a bobcat.

22:45.831 --> 22:48.095
- I know what a lynx is.
- <i>Oh.</i>

22:50.335 --> 22:52.326
You lie a lot, huh?

22:52.404 --> 22:54.338
I guess.

23:03.348 --> 23:05.942
- You hurt me, Colin.
- Eva. I'm really not up to this.

23:06.017 --> 23:08.008
You touched me in my private place.

23:08.086 --> 23:09.883
Would you stop saying that?

23:09.955 --> 23:12.947
You said that it was just
a little game, a secret game...

23:13.024 --> 23:16.118
and then you put
your big man thing inside me!

23:16.194 --> 23:18.355
Okay, listen.

23:24.302 --> 23:26.600
Fine. You got me. I did it.

23:28.707 --> 23:31.175
- You admit it?
- Absolutely.

23:31.243 --> 23:35.236
I boned you silly.
Stuck it in every chance I got.

23:35.313 --> 23:39.249
After all these years,
you finally admit it!

23:39.317 --> 23:42.480
That's right. Now if you'll excuse me,
you got some pimento loaf in there.

23:42.554 --> 23:45.819
- It's not doing you any favors.
- And you're not sorry?

23:45.891 --> 23:48.519
Eva, baby, little sis,
of course I'm sorry.

23:48.593 --> 23:50.857
I was a wretched, disgusting horn dog.

23:50.929 --> 23:54.330
But you were such a hot tamale,
I couldn't control myself.

23:54.399 --> 23:56.890
Oh, look. Okay. Don't-

23:56.968 --> 23:59.459
Look, for Christ's sakes, don't do that.
Look, I'm sorry.

23:59.538 --> 24:02.996
I hurt your woo-woo,
but it was, like, 80 years ago.

24:03.074 --> 24:05.065
Can we please move on?

24:07.813 --> 24:09.747
Oh, Colin.

24:09.815 --> 24:12.249
Oh, Colin, I forgive you.

24:12.317 --> 24:14.512
<i>I forgive you, Colin.</i>

24:17.122 --> 24:20.091
- <i>You can't nail your mom's doctor.</i>
- Why not?

24:20.158 --> 24:22.922
'Cause later, when she hates you,
she might give her the wrong pills.

24:22.994 --> 24:26.191
Nah, she wouldn't do that. She took an oath.
Besides, now I have to fuck her.

24:26.264 --> 24:27.925
Why?

24:27.999 --> 24:30.593
Because she pinned me to the cork
like some stupid horny beetle specimen...

24:30.669 --> 24:32.603
without even breaking a sweat.

24:32.671 --> 24:34.901
And so now you want to
sleep with her for revenge?

24:34.973 --> 24:36.907
Yeah.

24:36.975 --> 24:40.775
I need her to keep my mom alive long
enough for me to get the truth out of her.

24:40.846 --> 24:43.508
Why? What do you think
you're gonna find out?

24:43.582 --> 24:46.449
That I come from somebody else too.
Somebody real. Somebody normal.

24:46.518 --> 24:50.852
After all the psychotic shit she put me
through, it's the least she can do, right?

24:50.922 --> 24:52.856
I'm supposed to lock him in, Victor.

24:52.924 --> 24:54.789
He was very specific about that.

24:54.860 --> 24:57.090
You touch these stocks,
you're goin' in, Norm...

24:57.162 --> 25:00.359
and you won't be wearin'
that nifty sentry getup either.

25:00.432 --> 25:02.627
Dick.

25:02.701 --> 25:04.635
You shouldn't have done that.

25:04.703 --> 25:08.195
Now Charlie's gonna lobby
the town council to banish us again.

25:08.273 --> 25:12.403
- So, what'd you do this time?
- Forgot to wash this off.

25:12.477 --> 25:16.914
You ever think you might be fuckin' up
on purpose just to keep yourself in here?

25:16.982 --> 25:21.248
Maybe. All this time in the stocks,
I got myself almost a week sober.

25:21.319 --> 25:23.549
I wouldn't get too carried away
with this whole sobriety thing.

25:23.622 --> 25:26.591
Given to what your body's used to,
you're liable to explode.

25:26.658 --> 25:29.593
How 'bout you?
You start your fourth step yet?

25:29.661 --> 25:31.652
That's the, um-

25:31.730 --> 25:34.631
That's the searching, fearless inventory
of everything you did...

25:34.699 --> 25:38.430
and was done to you
in your sordid sex addict history.

25:38.503 --> 25:42.064
If you need some help, I'd be happy
to remind you of heinous shit you did.

25:42.140 --> 25:44.074
Thanks. I'm good.

25:44.142 --> 25:46.076
Hey, wait a minute.

25:46.144 --> 25:48.806
If your mom already thinks...

25:48.880 --> 25:52.372
that you're Artie, or Fred,
or whoever...

25:52.450 --> 25:54.850
how are you gonna convince her
that you're really you?

25:54.920 --> 25:56.854
I'm not.

25:59.224 --> 26:04.218
- Hi. I'm Victor.
- Dude, don't-don't- Don't gild the lily, okay?

26:06.231 --> 26:08.461
- That's her?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

26:08.533 --> 26:11.297
<i>She's young, for this place.</i>

26:11.369 --> 26:13.997
- I know.
- And still kind of hot.

26:14.072 --> 26:16.267
Jesus!

26:16.341 --> 26:18.809
And she won't notice I'm not you?

26:18.877 --> 26:21.471
We're about to find out.

26:26.251 --> 26:30.210
Mrs. Mancini, I brought your son.
I brought Victor.

26:30.288 --> 26:32.222
No.

26:33.224 --> 26:36.284
- No. It's not.
- <i>Yeah. Hi, Mom.</i>

26:37.829 --> 26:40.457
It's Victor. Hi.

26:45.503 --> 26:47.437
Victor!

26:50.675 --> 26:52.870
- Is that really you?
- Yep.

26:52.944 --> 26:54.935
It really is.

26:57.916 --> 27:01.215
Oh, Victor.

27:01.286 --> 27:05.086
Mom, your hands are freezing.

27:05.156 --> 27:07.989
Dude?

27:08.059 --> 27:09.822
Oh, Victor.

27:10.895 --> 27:13.056
Hey, you know, in my experience...

27:13.131 --> 27:16.157
I have found
that these puzzles work best...

27:16.234 --> 27:18.998
if you find all the edge pieces first.

27:19.070 --> 27:21.504
Oh! Found a corner.

27:21.573 --> 27:25.373
Hey, wasn't there
something you were gonna tell him?

27:25.443 --> 27:27.377
- Huh?
- <i>Wasn't there?</i>

27:27.445 --> 27:29.845
Oh, yeah.

27:29.914 --> 27:32.439
I'm so happy you've come, Victor.

27:34.152 --> 27:37.815
I have so much to tell you.
I have so much to explain.

27:42.327 --> 27:44.727
Murray.

27:44.796 --> 27:47.230
This is between my son and I.

27:47.298 --> 27:50.290
- I think maybe I should stay here because-
- Go!

27:50.368 --> 27:53.735
- <i>But you know, I don't think-</i>
- Murray, please.

28:00.111 --> 28:02.875
<i>My boy. My beautiful boy.</i>

28:02.947 --> 28:05.814
- Are you Victor?
- Yeah.

28:05.884 --> 28:09.285
What'd I-What-What'd I do to you?

28:09.354 --> 28:11.288
Nothing.

28:14.459 --> 28:17.622
<i>I'm so scared.</i>

28:28.840 --> 28:33.402
<i>That ceiling</i>
<i>was once covered with angels...</i>

28:33.478 --> 28:35.469
but they painted over them.

28:35.547 --> 28:39.483
- <i>Some papal decree.</i>
- Vatican II.

28:40.652 --> 28:43.780
- Are you Catholic?
- My mom, she's from-

28:43.855 --> 28:46.483
<i>Italy. I know.</i>

28:50.595 --> 28:52.859
I think I've found a way to save her.

28:54.399 --> 28:57.926
But it's going to require
your participation.

28:58.002 --> 29:01.802
It's an experimental procedure.
It's illegal.

29:01.873 --> 29:04.034
<i>I can't even guarantee
it will work.</i>

29:04.109 --> 29:06.407
In order to attempt this procedure...

29:06.478 --> 29:08.776
I'm going to need some embryonic tissue.

29:08.847 --> 29:11.714
Okay. Ho-Hold on a second.

29:11.783 --> 29:15.514
It's difficult for me to be so direct,
but time is a factor.

29:15.587 --> 29:18.886
My mucosa's so thick,
you could stand a spoon in it.

29:18.957 --> 29:21.016
Are you fucking with me?

29:21.092 --> 29:23.788
Given the options available to us,
this is her only hope.

29:23.862 --> 29:27.195
The good news is
she's an ideal candidate.

29:27.265 --> 29:30.996
All she needs is a healthy,
genetically compatible donor.

29:31.069 --> 29:33.128
And-And you know what to do?

29:33.204 --> 29:36.298
I put myself through med school
working nights in a stem cell research lab.

29:36.374 --> 29:41.141
That's hot. But why-why would you
put yourself out like this for her?

29:41.212 --> 29:44.045
Your mother
has been an inspiration to me.

29:44.115 --> 29:46.208
She changed my life.

29:46.284 --> 29:50.721
I'd never be able to forgive myself
if I didn't do everything I could to save her.

29:50.789 --> 29:53.314
Are we talking about the same person?

29:53.391 --> 29:56.258
Let's just do this
before I lose my nerve.

29:56.327 --> 29:58.818
H- Here?

29:58.897 --> 30:01.024
I can never see you
outside of this place.

30:01.099 --> 30:04.432
This has nothing to do with love...

30:04.502 --> 30:08.632
or commitment,
or anything like that.

30:08.706 --> 30:11.174
I simply need your seed.

30:11.242 --> 30:13.767
You should know,
I might be a sex addict.

30:13.845 --> 30:17.178
Well, just do what comes naturally.

30:17.248 --> 30:19.773
But I've got almost three days
of sobriety here.

30:19.851 --> 30:22.513
All right, two.

30:22.587 --> 30:24.521
Don't worry.

30:24.589 --> 30:28.719
With a little luck, your mother will soon
be just the same as she always was.

30:36.634 --> 30:39.398
<i>You couldn't get it up?</i>

30:39.470 --> 30:42.598
- That's nice. A little louder.
- Didn't think that thing ever went down.

30:42.674 --> 30:46.701
I'd like to see you cop a chubby with
the holy savior staring down your crack.

30:46.778 --> 30:49.747
Wow, man. This is huge.

30:49.814 --> 30:52.840
- What are you talking about?
- Look, who knows?

30:52.917 --> 30:56.318
Maybe you're really into her,
maybe you're just bottoming out...

30:56.387 --> 30:58.981
but the fact
that some part of you resisted...

30:59.057 --> 31:02.959
turning this into the usual nothing?

31:03.027 --> 31:05.427
Well, I'm calling that a really big step.

31:05.496 --> 31:09.296
You know, I think I liked you better
when you were just jerkin' off all the time.

31:11.002 --> 31:13.800
Hey, did you find out who I am yet?

31:13.872 --> 31:16.306
I'm trying, but, uh,
all she wants to do is hang out.

31:16.374 --> 31:18.808
- Really?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

31:18.877 --> 31:21.573
Check this out.

31:21.646 --> 31:25.309
- You putz, put that away. Put that away, man.
- Just check out-

31:25.383 --> 31:27.351
No, check out- check out that one.

31:29.354 --> 31:31.845
- Yeah.
- Where?

31:31.923 --> 31:35.256
- Isn't that your number?
- My parents are renting out my room.

31:35.326 --> 31:38.523
- But you still live there.
- I think that's sort of the point.

31:38.596 --> 31:42.589
Unless the date on that is 1763,
you guys are so fucked.

31:42.667 --> 31:45.636
- Promise?
- Yeah.

31:45.703 --> 31:48.035
Wasn't there anything in her diary?

31:50.341 --> 31:54.107
- Huh? What?
- No, she didn't.

31:56.748 --> 31:59.376
- God! Come on.
- Oh, shit.

31:59.450 --> 32:01.441
Thank you so much.

32:03.454 --> 32:06.048
- Take it.
- No, no, no. You take it.

32:08.293 --> 32:12.354
- <i>Afternoon, Your Loftiness.</i>
- 'Sup, lord?

32:12.430 --> 32:15.661
Spare me your dissembling
and relinquish the forbidden gazette.

32:15.733 --> 32:17.860
Okay! You're doin'
an accent thing now, aren't you?

32:17.936 --> 32:18.675
He is, right?

32:18.676 --> 32:21.633
Yeah, I thought we were
supposed to be Americans.

32:21.706 --> 32:23.697
I was reared in Yorkshire
by the good friars...

32:23.775 --> 32:26.573
and only recently made the voyage
to the New World.

32:26.644 --> 32:29.044
Come on, Charlie. You went to
Country Day with my cousin Todd.

32:29.113 --> 32:31.411
Shh, shh. Dude, dude. He's trying to-

32:31.482 --> 32:34.474
<i>You know something? You two are</i>
<i>this close to getting banished.</i>

32:34.552 --> 32:36.747
- You hear me? This close.
- What sayest thou?

32:36.821 --> 32:39.551
- Give me the goddamn newspaper!
- What's a newspaper?

32:39.624 --> 32:43.492
Yeah, Charlie. I don't think they
get invented for, like, another 80 years.

32:43.561 --> 32:46.257
<i>That's good. You're funny.</i>

32:46.331 --> 32:48.799
You both-
You think you're so funny.

32:48.866 --> 32:51.198
Always making fun of anything
that means anything to-

32:59.911 --> 33:03.074
- Oh, shit.
- Aha!

33:03.147 --> 33:05.138
Jesus.

33:05.216 --> 33:08.947
Take him to the stocks. This shall be
evidence in your banishment proceedings.

33:09.020 --> 33:11.682
No! Fuck.

33:14.058 --> 33:17.653
Hey, Denny! Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. What diary?

33:17.729 --> 33:20.391
- Huh?
- You said, "Wasn't there anything in her diary?"

33:20.465 --> 33:24.731
Oh, shit, dude, yeah. Your mom has
a total diary. She wants you to read it.

33:24.802 --> 33:28.067
- I don't know, dude. That's her diary.
- Hey, will you shut up?

33:28.139 --> 33:31.472
- Where is it?
- I think she sent it to your place.

33:50.928 --> 33:53.863
Oh. Oh, fuck!

33:54.899 --> 33:56.890
Fuck!

33:56.968 --> 34:00.802
I'd have thought a purely physical
encounter would be right up your alley.

34:00.872 --> 34:03.102
- It usually is.
- Then what's the problem?

34:03.174 --> 34:05.108
I don't know!

34:05.176 --> 34:09.078
Well, you'd better figure it out soon.
I can't ovulate forever.

34:09.147 --> 34:11.377
Hey, maybe- maybe I'm happy
with things the way they are.

34:11.449 --> 34:14.679
Maybe I like knowing she's not gonna
pop up at any moment and ruin my life.

34:14.752 --> 34:17.777
Maybe I don't want her back
the way she was.

34:17.855 --> 34:21.188
You don't want her to live.
You don't want her to die.

34:21.259 --> 34:24.251
- You don't know what you want.
- Sure I do. Sure I do.

34:24.328 --> 34:27.889
I want somebody who speaks Italian.

34:27.965 --> 34:30.126
Well, why didn't you say so?

34:31.768 --> 34:34.704
<i>You might not think
the best way...</i>

34:34.772 --> 34:37.502
to spend your first day of freedom...

34:37.574 --> 34:40.237
after a lengthy incarceration...

34:40.311 --> 34:43.143
<i>would be to immediately</i>
<i>resume stalking...</i>

34:43.214 --> 34:45.273
the tranny hooker...

34:45.349 --> 34:47.340
who knocked out six teeth...

34:47.418 --> 34:49.818
and had you put away to begin with.

34:49.887 --> 34:54.380
That's how I roll.

34:54.458 --> 34:56.893
<i>When I woke up in the hospital...</i>

34:56.960 --> 35:00.226
an orderly named Terrence...

35:00.298 --> 35:02.732
wheeled me into my first meeting.

35:03.968 --> 35:06.960
<i>All I can say is,</i>
<i>thank God for these rooms.</i>

35:08.573 --> 35:10.564
The rooms have saved my life.

35:10.641 --> 35:13.542
<i>The rooms are sacred.</i>

35:17.215 --> 35:20.241
<i>Come on. Give it to me. Perfect.</i>

35:20.318 --> 35:23.981
- Here... we... go!
- <i>Beautiful.</i>

35:26.090 --> 35:29.059
<i>What the fuck?</i>

35:29.260 --> 35:31.194
Excuse me, miss?

35:31.262 --> 35:34.095
<i>Excuse me?</i>
<i>That mole on your thigh.</i>

35:34.165 --> 35:37.259
- Yeah?
- You might want to get that looked at.

35:37.335 --> 35:39.803
Melanoma's the most common
cancer for women...

35:39.871 --> 35:42.499
between 19 and 34, especially blondes.

35:42.573 --> 35:46.065
<i>Couldn't get it up again, huh?</i>

35:46.144 --> 35:48.635
- What makes you say that?
- Call it a hunch.

35:50.148 --> 35:54.517
Don't forget to draw
her ingrown hairs, man.

35:54.585 --> 35:57.349
Break out some cash
and bring her back here so I can finish.

35:57.421 --> 35:59.685
Let me see this, Picasso.

35:59.757 --> 36:02.817
Dude, you made her look too pretty...

36:02.894 --> 36:05.055
and her ass is way bigger than that.

36:05.129 --> 36:07.063
<i>Here, let me see that.</i>

36:21.179 --> 36:23.773
He's right.
My ass is bigger than that.

36:23.848 --> 36:26.749
No. It's not.

36:28.186 --> 36:31.087
- What's your name?
- I'm Denny.

36:31.155 --> 36:33.146
I'm Cherry Daiquiri.

36:35.226 --> 36:37.922
It's not my real name.

36:54.345 --> 36:57.872
Dude, if this shit gets you laid...

36:57.949 --> 36:59.883
I'm gonna-

36:59.951 --> 37:03.216
You know, dude, before you
harsh out the whole planet...

37:03.287 --> 37:05.949
maybe you ought to go ahead
and start your fourth step.

37:06.023 --> 37:09.618
I will. Absolutely.
As soon as I get something to eat.

37:13.531 --> 37:17.126
You wanna come with? Denny?

37:17.201 --> 37:19.897
<i>Come on, man.</i>
<i>Let's get out of here.</i>

37:59.610 --> 38:01.805
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

38:30.741 --> 38:32.732
<i>Quentin Fairweather...</i>

38:32.810 --> 38:35.108
<i>please meet your wife</i>
<i>at the cosmetics counter.</i>

38:35.179 --> 38:37.670
<i>Mr. Quentin Fairweather.</i>

38:41.118 --> 38:43.712
You remembered Quentin Fairweather.

38:43.788 --> 38:46.416
Good boy.

38:46.490 --> 38:48.424
You look skinny.

38:50.561 --> 38:52.495
Come here.

38:53.497 --> 38:56.398
She's young, this one.
And pretty too.

38:56.467 --> 38:59.061
You like her?

38:59.136 --> 39:02.435
Don't tell me you don't,
'cause I saw you holding her hand.

39:02.506 --> 39:05.407
She's just another foster mom.

39:08.312 --> 39:10.246
Do you love her?

39:10.314 --> 39:12.248
No.

39:14.151 --> 39:16.085
Do you hate her?

39:16.153 --> 39:18.087
Um, yeah?

39:20.458 --> 39:22.653
That's right.
And how much do you hate her?

39:22.727 --> 39:24.718
Lots and lots.

39:39.610 --> 39:41.840
I think our work here is done.

39:41.912 --> 39:44.472
But... this one's nice.

39:44.548 --> 39:46.982
- What?
- She's nice.

39:48.018 --> 39:50.282
You're mine. Say it.

39:50.354 --> 39:52.288
Yours. I'm yours.

39:52.356 --> 39:54.688
- For?
- Ever and ever.

39:54.759 --> 39:57.250
That's right.

39:57.328 --> 39:59.489
Don't you forget it.

40:01.866 --> 40:04.096
- The little boy is approximately 10 years old.
- Where could he have gone?

40:06.270 --> 40:08.296
<i>Where are you presently?</i>

40:13.043 --> 40:16.308
Jesus! God! What have you done?

40:16.380 --> 40:19.247
Relax. I had to do this
to sneak it on to the bus.

40:19.316 --> 40:22.342
People see a big guy like me with a rock,
they get a little nervous.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.786
<i>Think I could stay
with you for a while?</i>

40:24.855 --> 40:28.518
- <i>Just till I find a place?</i>
- No. Absolutely not.

40:28.592 --> 40:32.050
No way. Hey, what are you-What are you-

40:34.031 --> 40:36.124
Hey, hey!

40:36.200 --> 40:38.134
Shit, man.

40:41.639 --> 40:43.971
So you gonna let me in
on this rock thing?

40:44.041 --> 40:47.533
I collect one for every day of sobriety.

40:47.611 --> 40:50.603
- Keeps the hands busy, if you know what I mean.
- That's good.

40:50.681 --> 40:52.876
I was afraid
it might be something stupid.

40:52.950 --> 40:56.681
- So how'd you make out with Cherry Daiquiri?
- Oh! Her name is Beth.

40:56.754 --> 40:58.881
Oh, right. Did you fuck Beth?

40:58.956 --> 41:02.483
Where's the diary? Can I see the diary?

41:02.560 --> 41:06.087
- It's in Italian. Paige is translating it for me.
- Who's Paige?

41:06.163 --> 41:09.690
- Dr. Marshall.
- <i>Oh, so she's "Paige"now. Hmm.</i>

41:09.767 --> 41:12.827
And she speaks Italian too.
What is she, perfect?

41:12.903 --> 41:15.167
You know something?
I think maybe she is.

41:15.239 --> 41:17.264
Hey! Where are you going?

41:17.341 --> 41:20.242
I'm gonna find out who my father is.
See you later.

41:24.482 --> 41:27.542
<i>That's him. He came to my potluck,</i>
<i>didn't bring a dish.</i>

41:27.618 --> 41:31.247
- He beat my sister almost to death.
- That's me.

41:34.358 --> 41:36.383
I think that's sweet-

41:36.460 --> 41:38.724
you giving them closure like that.

41:38.796 --> 41:40.730
So did you read it?

41:40.798 --> 41:42.732
Yes.

41:42.800 --> 41:45.826
And I'm afraid what I have to tell you
may be disappointing.

41:45.903 --> 41:48.770
It seems she was delusional
much earlier than you thought.

41:48.839 --> 41:50.773
What about my father?

41:50.841 --> 41:54.937
According to this, she got pregnant
with you when she was in her late 30s.

41:55.012 --> 41:58.311
She'd been living here for some time,
but went back for fertility treatments...

41:58.382 --> 42:00.646
at an experimental clinic in the Alps.

42:00.718 --> 42:02.948
So, what? He's some Italian doctor?

42:03.020 --> 42:07.354
No. And this is where it
kind of goes off the deep end.

42:07.424 --> 42:09.392
According to your mother's journal...

42:09.460 --> 42:12.088
this was about a year
after a collection...

42:12.162 --> 42:14.790
of religious relics
had gone missing in Rome.

42:14.865 --> 42:19.063
Six childless women were offered
genetic tissue from one of these relics.

42:19.136 --> 42:24.130
Five were a no-go
and the sixth became, apparently, you.

42:26.577 --> 42:28.511
<i>What kind of relic?</i>

42:28.579 --> 42:31.742
The relic, according to the journal,
was a sacred foreskin.

42:31.815 --> 42:33.749
Mummified, I would imagine.

42:33.817 --> 42:35.751
A foreskin? Whose foreskin?

42:35.819 --> 42:38.515
- The holy foreskin.
- Come on!

42:38.589 --> 42:40.955
It's all in here.

42:41.025 --> 42:43.016
So that would make me the son of-

42:43.093 --> 42:45.152
Jesus, more or less.

42:45.229 --> 42:47.789
But really more like a half clone.

42:47.865 --> 42:50.959
<i>It's kind of sweet really.</i>

42:51.035 --> 42:54.994
In her mind, you're literally
the Second Coming.

42:55.072 --> 42:58.940
- Dr. Marshall?
- Excuse me.

42:59.009 --> 43:02.274
<i> Beatrice? Where you going?</i>

43:02.346 --> 43:05.372
<i>I know you.</i>

43:05.449 --> 43:10.216
Yeah. Of course you do. What, did I give you
a wedgie or steal your cupcake or something?

43:10.287 --> 43:13.017
<i>No. My son saved you.</i>

43:13.090 --> 43:16.526
You were choking in a restaurant,
and he saved you.

43:16.594 --> 43:21.088
Secretly, I think Paul always
thought of himself as a coward...

43:21.165 --> 43:23.133
until that night.

43:23.200 --> 43:25.896
<i>His wife was on the verge</i>
<i>of divorcing him.</i>

43:25.970 --> 43:29.736
But when she saw what he did,
she fell back in love.

43:29.807 --> 43:31.741
<i>It was a miracle.</i>

43:31.809 --> 43:36.803
You have an enormous capacity
for love in you.

43:36.880 --> 43:40.372
I have a capacity for shit.

43:40.451 --> 43:44.512
It was a scam, lady.
I'm an evil, scheming douche bag.

43:44.588 --> 43:46.579
I know what I saw.

43:46.657 --> 43:49.785
- Uh- Come here! Let's go. Come on.
- Where are we going?

43:49.994 --> 43:52.019
<i>Hey, let me ask you something.</i>

43:52.096 --> 43:54.929
You don't think I'm
a good-hearted person, do you?

43:54.999 --> 43:57.160
No way, dude. You're an asshole.

43:57.234 --> 43:59.862
Thanks, man. Thanks.
Hey, what about this one?

43:59.937 --> 44:02.735
Eh-eh.

44:02.806 --> 44:05.206
This is how they drink beer in Europe.

44:05.275 --> 44:08.733
- From a slug trap?
- No, dude. Warm.

44:12.850 --> 44:15.580
- So what happened?
- Oh, yeah.

44:15.653 --> 44:18.144
So, you know,
I'm dragging her off to the chapel.

44:18.222 --> 44:21.749
My unit's enraged.
I'm thinking, "Here we go. Finally!"

44:21.825 --> 44:27.092
<i>I'm so hot, I'm flashing dead kittens and</i>
<i>Mother Teresa just to keep from triggering.</i>

44:27.164 --> 44:29.894
Hey.

44:29.967 --> 44:31.958
Hey.

44:32.036 --> 44:34.061
Over here.

44:37.708 --> 44:40.074
I want you to hear me.

44:42.613 --> 44:46.947
I want you moving
in perfect sync with my heart.

44:53.524 --> 44:55.458
There.

44:56.860 --> 44:59.294
Isn't that better?

45:12.976 --> 45:16.503
Fuck.

45:18.849 --> 45:21.283
If you don't want to do this,
you could just say so.

45:21.351 --> 45:23.285
I want to do this.

45:23.353 --> 45:25.878
Believe me,
I'm dyin'- I'm dyin' to do this.

45:25.956 --> 45:28.322
Well, then help me out here.

45:28.392 --> 45:32.453
Because apparently, you're capable of
having sex with everyone on the staff but me.

45:32.529 --> 45:36.397
Hey, look, I'm trying to ignore
the pressure and the old ladies...

45:36.467 --> 45:40.164
and the fact that I'm trying to fuck you
in a church to save my mom's brain.

45:40.237 --> 45:42.171
But so far it's not workin'.

45:42.239 --> 45:47.973
- Why?
- Because, um, I think I- I think maybe-

45:48.045 --> 45:52.778
I can't fuck you 'cause
I want to like you... instead.

45:54.284 --> 45:57.685
Has it occurred to you
that perhaps the two...

45:57.755 --> 46:00.519
aren't mutually exclusive?

46:01.525 --> 46:03.459
You said that?

46:03.527 --> 46:05.893
- Yeah.
- <i>Wow!</i>

46:05.963 --> 46:07.794
Maybe you're not so bad after all.

46:07.865 --> 46:09.730
No, dude. I am. I really am.

46:09.800 --> 46:14.066
<i>I mean, the cloning thing?</i>
<i>That could totally be real.</i>

46:14.138 --> 46:16.129
I saw this thing on Discovery.

46:16.206 --> 46:18.140
<i>They've been tryin'
it since the '60s.</i>

46:18.208 --> 46:21.405
- Do like this.
- Dude, stop doing that.

46:21.478 --> 46:23.537
<i>Stop looking at me like that.</i>

46:23.614 --> 46:26.082
You're creepin' me ou-

46:27.151 --> 46:29.085
Hi.

46:30.821 --> 46:32.755
Nice azaleas.

46:34.625 --> 46:36.820
Hey! Where you goin'?

46:40.030 --> 46:43.659
What are you-
What are you lookin' at?

46:43.734 --> 46:45.793
Belonged to my Uncle Don.

46:45.869 --> 46:49.430
That is, until he got hammered last month
and drove his car through a tree.

46:49.506 --> 46:53.966
Those Mothers Against Drunk Driving
probably had a party or somethin'.

46:54.044 --> 46:56.842
Who owns it now?

46:56.914 --> 46:58.905
Apparently, I do.

47:06.023 --> 47:07.957
<i>Now?</i>

47:08.025 --> 47:10.118
<i>Not yet.</i>

47:10.194 --> 47:12.424
Okay. You can open 'em.

47:14.097 --> 47:17.498
- The zoo? We're goin' to the zoo?
- That's right, kiddo.

47:17.568 --> 47:20.560
Give me your foot.

47:20.637 --> 47:22.969
What do you see?

47:23.040 --> 47:25.031
Animals.

47:25.108 --> 47:29.738
<i>Prisoners, held captive</i>
<i>like us in a world...</i>

47:29.813 --> 47:31.804
without risk, or struggle, or danger.

47:33.317 --> 47:36.184
The only difference
is that they can see the bars...

47:36.253 --> 47:39.086
that deny them all hope of escape.

47:40.824 --> 47:42.758
Until now.

47:46.663 --> 47:49.564
Mom?

47:55.672 --> 47:57.663
Mom!

48:36.246 --> 48:39.477
You go to bed, for Christ's sakes.
You're old. Get out.

48:39.549 --> 48:42.211
- Go to bed.
- So thoughtful.

48:54.298 --> 48:56.698
<i>Mom? Mom.</i>

48:58.435 --> 49:00.926
You scared me.
I didn't know where you were.

49:02.506 --> 49:04.497
Fuck!

49:04.574 --> 49:06.565
It wasn't my decision.

49:08.545 --> 49:11.810
I want her moved back downstairs...

49:11.882 --> 49:13.816
right now!

49:13.884 --> 49:18.218
Keep your voice down.
You're not even supposed to be here now.

49:18.288 --> 49:21.189
- Okay. Fine. I'll do this myself.
- Victor.

49:21.258 --> 49:23.488
Victor, please!

49:23.560 --> 49:25.755
She's better off up here.

49:25.829 --> 49:28.627
You said you were gonna do something.

49:28.699 --> 49:30.690
I couldn't do it by myself.

49:34.171 --> 49:37.834
Okay. Fine. Come here.
Let's go. Come on.

49:40.277 --> 49:42.643
What about here? Is this okay?

49:42.713 --> 49:44.704
- Come on.
- Oh, Victor!

49:44.781 --> 49:47.215
It's too late. My time's passed.

49:47.284 --> 49:49.718
All right. Okay.
Then let's try a stomach tube.

49:49.786 --> 49:51.981
I mean, that'll buy some time, right?

49:53.490 --> 49:57.426
- What? What's the matter?
- I don't know how to tell you this.

49:57.494 --> 50:01.760
- What?
- I made some calls.

50:01.832 --> 50:04.801
It all checks out-

50:04.868 --> 50:08.099
<i>the clinic,</i>
<i>the specialists, even the relic.</i>

50:08.171 --> 50:13.074
- What are you talking about?
- The theft was a huge deal in Rome.

50:13.143 --> 50:15.873
It was in the Vatican newspapers
and everything.

50:15.946 --> 50:18.779
Come on! Come on!
Stop with that shit! Stop!

50:18.849 --> 50:22.444
Here. You can check for yourself.

50:22.519 --> 50:26.148
In fact, I suggest you do,
just for your own peace of mind.

50:26.223 --> 50:29.158
You're not seriously telling me
you believe this shit?

50:29.226 --> 50:32.093
I don't know what to believe.

50:33.630 --> 50:37.828
I think it's better if we don't
see each other for a while.

50:37.901 --> 50:41.166
What? Why?

50:41.238 --> 50:44.173
It's not that
I don't have feelings for you.

50:44.241 --> 50:46.232
I do.

50:46.309 --> 50:48.971
It's just, I've seen the way
the patients look at you and-

50:49.046 --> 50:52.174
<i>'Cause my crazy mother's journal</i>
<i>says I'm the holy clone-</i>

50:52.249 --> 50:55.343
- Half clone.
- Of Jesus Christ?

50:55.419 --> 50:58.582
Paige, please- please, say i-

50:58.655 --> 51:01.818
Say it's 'cause I'm a-a pervert...

51:01.892 --> 51:05.328
<i>or- or a failure,</i>
<i>or-or just a really, really bad lay.</i>

51:05.395 --> 51:07.955
But please, not over this.

51:08.031 --> 51:10.499
What the fuck?

51:10.567 --> 51:13.968
What are you doing?
Get out of here.

51:14.037 --> 51:18.371
I'm not who you think I am, okay?
So would you all please fuck off?

51:18.442 --> 51:21.639
Get the fuck out of here!

51:21.711 --> 51:24.544
- And he's so humble.
- I am not humble.

51:24.614 --> 51:27.208
I'm not even good.
Would a good person do this?

51:27.284 --> 51:29.809
<i>Huh?</i>

51:29.886 --> 51:32.946
What about this?

51:34.257 --> 51:37.090
- Hey!
- Hey!

51:37.160 --> 51:40.323
Okay, what about this?

52:03.086 --> 52:07.022
<i>And faster than you can say,
"Jesus H. Clone"...</i>

52:07.090 --> 52:09.490
<i>I was alone... again.</i>

52:11.795 --> 52:15.094
<i>#How'd I arrive in a place like this #</i>

52:15.165 --> 52:19.397
<i># Red right hand</i>
<i>does the alligator kiss ##</i>

52:19.469 --> 52:24.202
<i> To reclaim my personal booth at
the café of diminished expectations...</i>

52:25.809 --> 52:28.903
<i>all I had to do was answer</i>
<i>one simple question:</i>

52:31.081 --> 52:33.515
<i>What would Jesus not do?</i>

52:36.019 --> 52:38.010
Don't kiss me on the mouth.

52:38.088 --> 52:40.022
Don't ask if you're hurting me.

52:40.090 --> 52:42.923
And if you hear the safe word,
stop what you're doing immediately.

52:42.993 --> 52:44.961
Do you have panty hose?

52:45.028 --> 52:46.928
You want me to rip you in drag?

52:46.997 --> 52:50.091
- F-For your head.
- Oh.

52:50.167 --> 52:53.830
I need you to be a faceless attacker.

52:53.904 --> 52:55.895
Here, you'll need this.

52:55.972 --> 52:58.406
Whoa! Jesus.

52:58.475 --> 53:01.444
Um, couldn't I just, you know,
rough you up a little?

53:01.511 --> 53:05.504
Mmm. No, absolutely not. The knife is
very important to my total experience.

53:05.582 --> 53:09.416
I mean, be careful with it, 'cause if you
so much as scratch me with that thing...

53:09.486 --> 53:12.114
I will have you in prison
before you can put your pants on.

53:12.189 --> 53:16.091
- Anything else?
- Yes. And this is very important.

53:16.159 --> 53:18.957
Whatever you do,
do not rape me on the bed.

53:19.029 --> 53:21.463
The bedspread is silk. It will spot.

53:21.531 --> 53:24.830
So rape me on the floor,
but not on the floor itself.

53:24.901 --> 53:27.927
On a towel on the floor,
but on the wood part, not the rug.

53:28.004 --> 53:30.404
- Got it?
- Got it.

53:33.009 --> 53:35.000
What's the safe word?

53:35.078 --> 53:37.478
Poodle.

53:48.992 --> 53:50.926
- Oh, God! No!
- Yeah.

53:50.994 --> 53:53.155
No, help me, please!
Not the bed! Not the bed!

53:53.230 --> 53:55.960
Or the rug! Or the-
Try the towel.

53:56.032 --> 53:58.057
- Remember? The towel?
- Oh, yeah.

53:58.134 --> 54:01.695
- Oh, ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow! Stop! Please!
- Right.

54:01.771 --> 54:05.207
Please, you're hurting me. Stop!

54:05.275 --> 54:07.436
<i>Please! Ow! Ow! Ow!</i>

54:07.510 --> 54:10.001
- Okay.
- Did I say "poodle"?

54:10.080 --> 54:13.846
- No.
- No, then I'm not really hurt, you fucking moron!

54:13.917 --> 54:17.853
- Wait a minute. Wait! Are those my hose?
- Uh, yeah.

54:17.921 --> 54:21.618
<i>For Christ's sake, what kind of rapist</i>
<i>doesn't bring his own panty hose?</i>

54:21.691 --> 54:25.058
- Look, I'm sorry, but the drugstore-
- No, don't apologize!

54:25.128 --> 54:27.392
Just demean me, you stupid shit!

54:27.464 --> 54:32.231
Oh. Okay.
That's better. Now hit me.

54:32.302 --> 54:35.430
- Do you want me to use the knife, or-
- No. Not with the-

54:35.505 --> 54:38.804
When you hit someone with a knife,
that's stabbing. Hit me!

54:38.875 --> 54:41.605
Ow! But not in the head,
you dumb ass!

54:41.678 --> 54:45.341
You're gonna give me a concussion.
Lower! Lower!

54:45.415 --> 54:48.851
How 'bout you shut the fuck up
and let me rape you my way?

54:48.918 --> 54:50.681
- How 'bout that?
- Well, you know?

54:50.754 --> 54:53.086
Well, if that's how you feel about it...

54:53.156 --> 54:56.250
you might want to take your little
friend there and run along home.

54:56.326 --> 54:58.726
Or your way's good.
We can do it your way.

54:58.795 --> 55:00.729
Come on!

55:01.931 --> 55:03.865
Okay. Okay. Okay.

55:03.933 --> 55:06.993
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a second. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

55:07.070 --> 55:09.504
What about me? How 'bout me?

55:09.572 --> 55:13.804
Well, you can take care of yourself. Just put
your stuff on the towel when you're done.

55:18.648 --> 55:21.776
I've got to switch.

55:21.851 --> 55:25.651
Mmm.

55:43.707 --> 55:46.642
Hey, wait a minute.

55:46.710 --> 55:49.235
<i>Where did you put your-</i>

55:49.312 --> 55:50.904
Hey!

55:50.980 --> 55:53.210
Poodle.

56:15.004 --> 56:18.462
As the body doth regurgitate
spoilt meats...

56:18.541 --> 56:22.705
so shalt the ungodly be cast
from the bosom of fair Dunsboro.

56:24.514 --> 56:27.506
We therefore commit this body
to the earth...

56:27.584 --> 56:30.576
to be turned once more
into corruption.

56:44.300 --> 56:46.234
Victor, I-

56:51.074 --> 56:55.010
Feel like I'm not a very good sponsor.

56:58.081 --> 56:59.946
Oww!

57:00.016 --> 57:02.075
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

57:02.152 --> 57:04.086
I'm not a lawn mower.

57:04.154 --> 57:06.418
Jesus.

57:08.024 --> 57:10.424
- Oops.
- What's the matter?

57:11.461 --> 57:13.520
Man overboard.

57:13.596 --> 57:16.656
What are you saying?
Are you saying-

57:16.733 --> 57:19.861
Oh. Well, it'll work its way out.

57:19.936 --> 57:22.302
Yeah?

57:22.372 --> 57:25.068
- Yeah.
- Good luck with that.

57:30.647 --> 57:34.014
Hey! You changed your hair.

57:34.083 --> 57:37.246
Yeah, 'cause of what you said
about blondes getting skin cancer.

57:37.320 --> 57:41.086
- Good thinkin'!
- You can never be too careful.

57:44.594 --> 57:47.529
Can I get some nuts, please? Nuts?

57:47.597 --> 57:49.531
How is she?

57:49.599 --> 57:53.729
- Who cares? I wasn't that into her anyway.
- No, I-I meant your mom.

57:53.803 --> 57:57.330
Oh. Yeah. Tell you the truth,
I wish she'd just die already.

57:57.407 --> 58:01.776
You need to go see her, dude. And go to
a meeting. You've barely been home in days.

58:01.845 --> 58:05.178
You're stalking a stripper,
and you're concerned about my sobriety?

58:05.248 --> 58:08.979
No, I'm not stalking her.
It's a healthy relationship.

58:10.153 --> 58:12.087
I love her.

58:12.155 --> 58:14.089
You what?

58:14.157 --> 58:16.057
I love her.

58:16.125 --> 58:18.525
And...

58:18.595 --> 58:20.529
we're moving in together.

58:20.597 --> 58:22.724
That's nice.

58:29.873 --> 58:33.468
You know,
she's not as attractive as you think.

58:46.155 --> 58:48.146
What?

58:51.794 --> 58:55.195
You're my best friend in the whole world.

58:55.265 --> 58:57.699
But this girl...

58:57.767 --> 59:01.533
she's, like, the only nice thing
that's ever happened to me.

59:01.604 --> 59:06.473
So you think you could resist the impulse
to piss all over it just this once?

59:06.543 --> 59:08.408
Sure.

59:08.478 --> 59:10.537
Thanks.

59:12.248 --> 59:15.911
I just hope you're cool paying a kid's
tuition with a bunch of wrinkly ones.

59:17.287 --> 59:19.278
Go see your mom, dude.

59:21.224 --> 59:24.125
And start your fourth step already.
Don't you think you've suffered enough?

59:24.193 --> 59:26.525
No.

59:32.535 --> 59:34.628
Ira.

59:36.706 --> 59:39.004
Ira and Tammy Hastings.

59:40.910 --> 59:42.844
<i>Do you love him...</i>

59:42.912 --> 59:45.813
Ira here?

59:45.882 --> 59:48.009
I do.

59:48.084 --> 59:50.780
Do you love her?

59:50.853 --> 59:53.549
- No.
- Ira!

59:54.691 --> 59:56.625
Okay. Yeah, I love her.

59:56.693 --> 01:00:00.026
<i>Do you know how lucky you are?</i>

01:00:01.631 --> 01:00:04.964
Poor Victor isn't very good
at loving people.

01:00:05.034 --> 01:00:07.969
<i>I'm afraid that when I'm gone...</i>

01:00:08.037 --> 01:00:12.736
there won't be anyone left in
the whole world who will love Victor.

01:00:29.392 --> 01:00:31.326
Hey.

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:33.328
- Uh, yeah, thanks, but-
- For what?

01:00:33.396 --> 01:00:35.421
For, uh, lying back there.

01:00:35.498 --> 01:00:39.025
Look, I know I overreacted before...

01:00:39.102 --> 01:00:42.037
but the information
was a little startling at first.

01:00:42.105 --> 01:00:45.666
Now the prospect of dating
a clone deity seems kind of neat?

01:00:45.742 --> 01:00:50.475
If I could take it back I would.

01:00:50.546 --> 01:00:53.709
But the thing is,
I wasn't lying in there.

01:00:53.783 --> 01:00:56.115
So if you feel anything...

01:00:56.185 --> 01:00:58.119
you know...

01:00:58.187 --> 01:01:00.052
remotely similar for me...

01:01:00.123 --> 01:01:04.059
then now would be
a really good time to say so.

01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:20.442
<i>Pathetic.</i>

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:22.740
What the f-
What are you doing up?

01:01:22.812 --> 01:01:25.372
- You should be ashamed.
- <i>What are you talking about?</i>

01:01:25.448 --> 01:01:27.382
Go back to bed, for God's sake.

01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:30.385
That woman just placed her heart
in the palm of your hand...

01:01:30.453 --> 01:01:32.387
and you toss it aside
like some old shoe...

01:01:32.455 --> 01:01:35.083
because you can't muster the guts
to admit you feel the same way.

01:01:35.158 --> 01:01:37.456
Who says I feel the same way?

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:39.927
Oh, please.
It's written all over you.

01:01:39.996 --> 01:01:44.729
You'd sooner let the woman you love walk out
the door than stand up and declare yourself.

01:01:44.801 --> 01:01:47.565
- Okay, whatever-
- What's that, Fred? Speak up!

01:01:47.637 --> 01:01:50.071
I'm not Fred! It's me!

01:01:50.139 --> 01:01:52.073
It's Victor.

01:01:52.141 --> 01:01:55.076
And you're right- I'm pathetic.

01:01:55.144 --> 01:01:56.805
I have sex with strangers...

01:01:56.879 --> 01:02:00.576
<i>because I'm incapable of doing it</i>
<i>with someone I actually like.</i>

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:03.346
I can't even ask anyone out on a date...

01:02:03.419 --> 01:02:06.411
'cause if it doesn't end up
in a high-speed chase, I get bored.

01:02:06.489 --> 01:02:08.923
That's not what I'm talking about.

01:02:08.991 --> 01:02:10.925
I've kept myself numb for so long...

01:02:10.993 --> 01:02:14.429
that now I want to actually
feel something and I can't...

01:02:14.497 --> 01:02:17.022
because no matter where I go,
no matter what I do...

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:19.762
I always end up back here with you.

01:02:19.836 --> 01:02:23.431
Well, you say that like it's a bad thing.

01:02:23.506 --> 01:02:26.441
I need to break up, Ma.

01:02:26.509 --> 01:02:28.443
Now.

01:02:28.511 --> 01:02:31.173
Before it's too late.

01:02:31.247 --> 01:02:33.545
You were always so good at walking-

01:02:33.616 --> 01:02:36.016
walking away.

01:02:36.085 --> 01:02:38.610
Show me how.

01:02:40.423 --> 01:02:42.448
All right.

01:02:48.364 --> 01:02:50.491
Of course I will.

01:02:52.568 --> 01:02:56.129
All I've ever wanted to do
is to make you happy.

01:02:56.205 --> 01:02:58.673
You know that, Fred.

01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:03.871
I'm hungry now.

01:03:10.219 --> 01:03:12.210
<i>Victor, don't play with your food.</i>

01:03:12.288 --> 01:03:15.223
Come on. Eat your hot dog.

01:03:16.492 --> 01:03:18.687
<i>Victor, no.</i>

01:03:18.761 --> 01:03:22.663
We cannot go to that park. It's late.
We have to make the state line.

01:03:39.115 --> 01:03:41.049
<i>Okay.</i>

01:03:41.117 --> 01:03:44.575
We got bus boys to clear the table, hon.

01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:47.122
<i>Charlene.</i>

01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:50.057
Come on, honey, toss it in.
We'll eat it later.

01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:55.127
Victor.

01:03:56.399 --> 01:03:58.867
<i>Victor, what are you doing?</i>

01:03:58.935 --> 01:04:00.926
Victor.

01:04:06.209 --> 01:04:08.302
Victor!

01:04:08.377 --> 01:04:10.971
Victor. Victor.

01:04:13.716 --> 01:04:16.378
Oh! He's okay.

01:04:18.521 --> 01:04:20.512
Oh, boy.

01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:24.516
Check this out.

01:04:28.497 --> 01:04:30.488
I'm sorry.

01:04:33.402 --> 01:04:37.168
Oh, my God.

01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:03.255
No, no, no, no.

01:05:08.004 --> 01:05:10.404
So, what is this?

01:05:10.473 --> 01:05:12.407
I don't know yet.

01:05:12.475 --> 01:05:15.410
You don't know what you're building, huh?

01:05:15.478 --> 01:05:18.538
This isn't about getting something done.

01:05:18.614 --> 01:05:23.779
It's about process.
I want to do something good.

01:05:23.853 --> 01:05:27.311
Instead of just trying not
to do bad stuff all the time.

01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:31.383
This is pretty ridiculous, dude,
even for you.

01:05:35.531 --> 01:05:37.863
You need some help?

01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:43.031
You can help if you want to,
but we don't need your help.

01:05:43.105 --> 01:05:47.371
By "we," you mean that you and Cherry
Daiquiri have the project under control?

01:05:47.443 --> 01:05:50.378
Her name's Beth.

01:05:50.446 --> 01:05:54.382
And I'm sorry if our relationship
is triggering your abandonment issues.

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:56.748
Blah, blah, blah.

01:06:07.596 --> 01:06:10.588
You have to forgive me, Victor.
I feel terrible.

01:06:11.867 --> 01:06:14.028
Please.

01:06:15.871 --> 01:06:19.238
I'll do anything.

01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:34.923
If this was a churn
we'd have butter an hour ago.

01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:36.925
It's not you.

01:06:36.993 --> 01:06:38.927
Yes. I'm aware of that.

01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:44.433
You sure you're all right? There's some
weird noises coming from your stomach.

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:47.435
Are you kidding me?
I'm having a wonderful time.

01:06:47.503 --> 01:06:50.438
Did you go out
with Lord High Charlie yet?

01:06:50.506 --> 01:06:52.440
No.

01:06:52.508 --> 01:06:55.602
He asks me all the time,
but I always say no.

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:58.613
- Which is typical.
- Why?

01:06:58.681 --> 01:07:01.548
Because he's sweet and...

01:07:01.617 --> 01:07:03.778
I kind of like him.

01:07:03.853 --> 01:07:07.846
But me,
I always go for the asshole.

01:07:09.025 --> 01:07:10.959
No offense.

01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:12.961
None taken.

01:07:15.297 --> 01:07:17.629
Hey. We got company.

01:07:19.635 --> 01:07:21.569
Hey.

01:07:21.637 --> 01:07:24.572
Let me just rest
while I do it for a second.

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:26.904
See this goat?

01:07:28.978 --> 01:07:30.912
Hey, little goat.

01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:33.278
Hey.

01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:35.146
<i>You want some food?</i>

01:07:45.227 --> 01:07:48.856
<i>Oh, no. No. No, no.</i>

01:07:48.931 --> 01:07:50.922
Not you. Not with you.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.798
- Charlie-
- How could she do this to me?

01:07:53.869 --> 01:07:57.896
- Shh, shh, shh.
- I was so completely into her. Now it's ruined!

01:07:57.973 --> 01:08:00.407
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
- <i>Shh, shh. Ch- Charlie-</i>

01:08:00.476 --> 01:08:02.637
- Oh, my God!
- <i>Charlie.</i>

01:08:02.711 --> 01:08:05.646
Charlie? Don't do- Don't do that.

01:08:05.714 --> 01:08:09.980
What is wrong with me? Why do I fall
for the wrong people every fucking time?

01:08:10.052 --> 01:08:14.182
- It's not what you're thinking.
- Isn't that your penis in her hand?

01:08:14.256 --> 01:08:16.281
Well, yeah, but-

01:08:16.358 --> 01:08:19.794
You don't care about her.
You don't care about anything.

01:08:19.862 --> 01:08:22.386
How could she possibly
find that appealing?

01:08:23.466 --> 01:08:25.696
Human nature, I guess.

01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:29.067
I thought she was so special.
And now look at her.

01:08:29.138 --> 01:08:33.234
Charlie, don't say that. She's a-
She's a- She's a good girl, you know.

01:08:33.309 --> 01:08:36.243
She was just saying
how much she liked you.

01:08:36.312 --> 01:08:39.076
When?
While she was jerking you off?

01:08:39.148 --> 01:08:42.345
Well, yeah. But this is nothing.

01:08:42.417 --> 01:08:45.353
Believe me. I'm just
her little trip to the dark side.

01:08:45.421 --> 01:08:49.482
<i>You, you've got the guts</i>
<i>to hang it out there...</i>

01:08:49.558 --> 01:08:51.685
let her know how you feel.

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:54.694
That's-
That's more than I've ever done.

01:08:54.763 --> 01:08:57.197
She sees that. She respects it.

01:08:57.265 --> 01:09:00.201
- Clearly.
- Listen to me, Charlie.

01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:04.501
The way I see it, you got one chance
to turn this thing around...

01:09:04.573 --> 01:09:09.636
and that's to back on out of this barn
and forget you ever walked in here.

01:09:09.712 --> 01:09:13.011
She deserves that. You both do.

01:09:14.917 --> 01:09:17.852
- Really?
- Really.

01:09:20.622 --> 01:09:22.613
Thank you.

01:09:28.930 --> 01:09:32.957
<i>Hello, everybody.</i>
<i>My name is Phil, and I'm a sex addict.</i>

01:09:33.035 --> 01:09:34.593
<i>Hello. Hi, Phil.</i>

01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:38.106
Hold this.

01:09:38.174 --> 01:09:40.608
<i>Tonight's meeting is a step meeting.</i>

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:45.511
Whether you just started
the step, or you're stuck.

01:09:47.082 --> 01:09:49.140
What's the matter with you?

01:09:49.218 --> 01:09:52.210
Anybody here working on a fourth step?

01:09:53.288 --> 01:09:55.223
<i>Anybody?</i>

01:09:57.092 --> 01:10:00.789
Swear to God, you go in there with those losers,
and I will never get with you again.

01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:04.822
<i> Once you get started,</i>
<i>it feels good to get better...</i>

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:09.496
<i>because you can begin</i>
<i>to think about movin' on.</i>

01:10:11.807 --> 01:10:15.368
<i>Hi. My name's Victor.</i>

01:10:15.444 --> 01:10:17.571
I'm a sex addict.

01:10:17.646 --> 01:10:19.238
Hi, Victor.

01:10:19.315 --> 01:10:21.647
This is Nico.

01:10:22.952 --> 01:10:26.115
Yeah. My name is Nico.

01:10:26.188 --> 01:10:29.749
And you people can all get fucked!

01:10:43.872 --> 01:10:48.275
I've been trying to start my fourth step
for a really long time now.

01:10:48.344 --> 01:10:51.370
<i>You know, Victor,</i>
<i>sometimes the best place to start...</i>

01:10:51.447 --> 01:10:53.574
is at the beginning.

01:10:53.649 --> 01:10:58.677
Try thinking back
to when you first lost your way.

01:11:11.066 --> 01:11:13.000
S-Sorry.

01:11:13.068 --> 01:11:16.526
<i> If you're trying to make me feel bad,
you're doing a wonderful job.</i>

01:11:18.507 --> 01:11:21.340
Are you ta-Are you talking to me?

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:23.571
<i>You see anyone else around?</i>

01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:27.210
Um-

01:11:38.394 --> 01:11:40.328
Hi.

01:11:40.396 --> 01:11:42.330
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:11:42.398 --> 01:11:44.332
Where you coming from?

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.698
Um, Thanksgiving with my mom...

01:11:46.769 --> 01:11:48.703
at the state mental hospital.

01:11:48.771 --> 01:11:51.706
Oh. And how was that?

01:11:51.774 --> 01:11:53.708
Um-

01:11:53.776 --> 01:11:55.710
Aww. That's okay, honey.

01:11:55.778 --> 01:11:58.713
- It was kinda-
- That's what the circuit's here for.

01:11:58.781 --> 01:12:01.511
Shit.

01:12:01.583 --> 01:12:02.182
Maybe we -

01:12:02.183 --> 01:12:05.178
That's the one drawback
of the bathroom pick-up.

01:12:05.254 --> 01:12:07.688
Have you done this before?

01:12:07.756 --> 01:12:11.192
Haven't you ever opened a door
on a train or a plane...

01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:13.524
seen someone standing there
and thought...

01:12:13.595 --> 01:12:16.291
"Why don't they just lock the door?"

01:12:16.365 --> 01:12:19.300
I thought that was, like, an accident or-

01:12:19.368 --> 01:12:22.804
There are no accidents
on the circuit, honey.

01:12:22.871 --> 01:12:24.862
Circuit?

01:12:26.575 --> 01:12:28.634
So-

01:12:28.711 --> 01:12:30.702
Um-

01:12:32.614 --> 01:12:35.549
- Late bloomer, huh?
- Sorry. Yeah, kind of.

01:12:35.617 --> 01:12:37.676
Here, let me help you.

01:12:43.525 --> 01:12:45.516
Oh!

01:12:46.995 --> 01:12:48.929
See?

01:12:48.997 --> 01:12:51.932
All you needed was a jump start.

01:13:03.412 --> 01:13:05.346
Feeling better?

01:13:06.415 --> 01:13:08.349
Yeah.

01:13:08.417 --> 01:13:10.351
Good.

01:13:10.419 --> 01:13:13.354
But please don't think
this was anything special.

01:13:13.422 --> 01:13:16.983
And don't forget to lock the door.

01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:21.591
That is,
if you want it locked anymore.

01:13:23.132 --> 01:13:26.966
<i>#Daylight is creeping #</i>

01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:29.069
<i>Thank you for that, Richard.</i>

01:13:29.138 --> 01:13:31.572
<i>We're here on scene</i>
<i>with Victor Mancini...</i>

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:34.053
<i>one of the builders</i>
<i>of this mystery rock structure.</i>

01:13:34.054 --> 01:13:35.076
Sitting there naked and alone.

01:13:35.144 --> 01:13:37.078
Hey, Victor! You're on TV.

01:13:37.146 --> 01:13:41.082
<i>All the people around are wanting to know,</i>
<i>what is this structure going to be?</i>

01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:44.449
- <i>We don't know. It's about process.</i>
- What's it going to become?

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:49.287
The structure will continue
to evolve until the last rock is set.

01:13:49.358 --> 01:13:53.556
People should bring one by. They can
alter the nature of what it becomes.

01:13:53.629 --> 01:13:56.753
<i> So, there you have it.</i>
<i>Bring a rock and come on down.</i>

01:13:57.499 --> 01:14:01.868
- <i>This is Roger Fessenden, Action 2 News.</i>
- <i> In other news-</i>

01:14:01.937 --> 01:14:05.168
Hey, that rock thing was a nice touch.

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:07.367
Thanks.

01:14:13.248 --> 01:14:18.185
Hey, you think Jesus was
automatically good from the start?

01:14:18.253 --> 01:14:20.585
You don't hear much
about the teen years.

01:14:20.656 --> 01:14:23.591
Maybe Jesus was kind of a dick
for a while.

01:14:23.659 --> 01:14:26.093
<i>Then he started helping old ladies</i>
<i>cross the street...</i>

01:14:26.161 --> 01:14:28.595
and turning off people's headlights
and stuff...

01:14:28.664 --> 01:14:31.929
and he just kinda grew
into the whole messiah thing.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.161
I mean, that's not impossible, right?

01:14:34.236 --> 01:14:37.899
- This is Jesus?
- Yeah.

01:14:37.973 --> 01:14:39.565
I don't know.

01:14:39.641 --> 01:14:41.871
Yeah. Of course you don't.

01:14:41.944 --> 01:14:45.436
<i>But if you read the
New Testament...</i>

01:14:45.514 --> 01:14:48.847
especially some
of the Paul stuff in Galatians...

01:14:48.917 --> 01:14:53.217
<i>Jesus was all about the idea</i>
<i>that people are transformed...</i>

01:14:53.288 --> 01:14:56.280
not by being loved,
but by the act of loving somebody...

01:14:56.358 --> 01:14:59.555
no matter how difficult it is.

01:14:59.628 --> 01:15:02.290
So it only stands to reason
he could've developed this theory...

01:15:02.364 --> 01:15:06.630
on his whole, you know,
personal savior journey.

01:15:19.181 --> 01:15:21.172
Hello.

01:15:22.417 --> 01:15:25.386
Yeah. Okay. I'll tell him.

01:15:27.456 --> 01:15:30.391
Um, it's about your mom.
They moved her.

01:15:33.295 --> 01:15:36.924
I brought you some pudding.
It's chocolate. It's your favorite.

01:15:36.999 --> 01:15:39.661
Oh, that's very sweet, Victor...

01:15:39.735 --> 01:15:42.135
but I'm not very hungry.

01:15:42.204 --> 01:15:44.138
Well, you have to tr-

01:15:44.206 --> 01:15:47.107
What did-What did you call me?

01:15:47.175 --> 01:15:50.838
Victor.
That's still your name, isn't it?

01:15:50.913 --> 01:15:53.905
Yeah. Yes, it is.

01:15:57.185 --> 01:15:58.948
We have to talk, sweetie.

01:15:59.021 --> 01:16:01.990
Forget about that now.
Just try and get some of this down.

01:16:02.057 --> 01:16:05.288
There's something I've been meaning
to tell you for a long time.

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:09.194
Don't worry. I already know
what you had to do to get me.

01:16:09.264 --> 01:16:11.425
You do?

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:15.994
I know you came from Italy
impregnated by the sacred foreskin.

01:16:16.071 --> 01:16:18.039
The what?

01:16:18.106 --> 01:16:21.735
You wrote it in Italian
so I wouldn't read it...

01:16:21.810 --> 01:16:24.244
but Dr. Marshall told me the truth.

01:16:24.313 --> 01:16:29.012
I know who I am,
and I know I can save you.

01:16:29.084 --> 01:16:32.884
What the hell are you talking about?

01:16:32.955 --> 01:16:37.415
I stole you from a stroller
in Waterloo, Iowa.

01:16:37.492 --> 01:16:40.757
<i>Mom, you don't have to-</i>
<i>you don't have to lie anymore.</i>

01:16:40.829 --> 01:16:42.763
Who's lying?

01:16:42.831 --> 01:16:45.629
You were at the Cadillac Bowling Alley
on LaPorte Road.

01:16:47.636 --> 01:16:49.831
Wh-

01:16:49.905 --> 01:16:53.466
You're saying that you, uh-

01:16:53.542 --> 01:16:57.342
<i>You're saying you're not-</i>
<i>that you're not my, uh-</i>

01:16:59.081 --> 01:17:01.948
What are you saying?

01:17:02.017 --> 01:17:04.747
You're saying you're not my-

01:17:06.421 --> 01:17:08.412
That you're not my-

01:17:13.862 --> 01:17:15.853
Mom.

01:17:15.931 --> 01:17:17.865
Hey.

01:17:17.933 --> 01:17:19.730
Mom.

01:17:19.801 --> 01:17:22.065
Mom. Mom!

01:17:22.137 --> 01:17:24.071
Mom!

01:17:24.139 --> 01:17:27.768
Help! Help! Help!

01:17:27.843 --> 01:17:30.437
Ida?

01:17:30.512 --> 01:17:32.446
Ida?

01:17:32.514 --> 01:17:35.711
<i>She's choking. I choked her.</i>

01:17:35.784 --> 01:17:37.718
She denied my- my birth origins.

01:17:37.786 --> 01:17:39.879
She made up some story about Iowa.

01:17:39.955 --> 01:17:41.684
Your birth origins?

01:17:41.757 --> 01:17:44.021
<i>Oh.</i>

01:17:44.092 --> 01:17:47.528
Live! Live!

01:17:47.596 --> 01:17:50.292
I command you to live! Live!

01:17:50.365 --> 01:17:52.390
I'm afraid
there's been a misunderstanding.

01:17:52.467 --> 01:17:55.459
Live. Live.

01:18:04.246 --> 01:18:06.237
You're a patient?

01:18:06.314 --> 01:18:09.806
- Yeah.
- What the fuck, man?

01:18:12.688 --> 01:18:15.816
Is she okay- Is she-Wh-

01:18:15.891 --> 01:18:18.792
Oh, God.

01:18:19.828 --> 01:18:21.762
<i>Is she-</i>

01:18:22.831 --> 01:18:25.732
What have I-What have I done?

01:18:37.813 --> 01:18:40.077
We don't need this.

01:18:40.148 --> 01:18:42.082
But we're lost.

01:18:42.150 --> 01:18:44.584
We're not lost, we're pioneers...

01:18:44.653 --> 01:18:47.588
blazing a trail through the new frontier.

01:18:47.656 --> 01:18:49.851
And if you look very closely...

01:18:49.925 --> 01:18:53.190
you'll see an opportunity
to overcome your fear.

01:18:53.261 --> 01:18:56.856
- How do we know which way to go?
- Come here.

01:18:56.932 --> 01:18:58.923
Come on.

01:19:00.035 --> 01:19:02.003
Okay. Take the wheel.

01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:04.004
Good.

01:19:04.072 --> 01:19:06.438
And listen very closely.

01:19:06.508 --> 01:19:09.944
'Cause nothing worth having
comes without a risk.

01:19:10.011 --> 01:19:12.502
'Cause I won't always
be around to nag you.

01:19:12.914 --> 01:19:17.146
'Cause sometimes it's not important
which way you jump...

01:19:17.219 --> 01:19:19.153
just that you jump.

01:19:19.221 --> 01:19:22.156
<i> Victor, I know it was an accident.</i>

01:19:22.224 --> 01:19:25.557
<i>Let's be on the safe side.</i>
<i>How 'bout we get you out of here?</i>

01:19:25.627 --> 01:19:29.188
Victor. Come on.
We don't have much time.

01:19:29.264 --> 01:19:32.199
- You're not even really a doctor, are you?
- Technically, no.

01:19:32.267 --> 01:19:34.923
All that crap about stem cells
and curing my mother?

01:19:34.924 --> 01:19:35.725
Experimental, yes.

01:19:35.804 --> 01:19:38.830
- But it might have worked.
- What about the diary?

01:19:38.907 --> 01:19:40.841
Okay, that I made up.

01:19:40.909 --> 01:19:42.843
You mean you-

01:19:42.911 --> 01:19:46.369
Well, once I got to know you, I realized
you could never reciprocate my feelings...

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:49.884
unless I helped you connect
to your own inner goodness.

01:19:49.951 --> 01:19:51.885
What does it say?

01:19:51.953 --> 01:19:55.354
You don't even speak Italian, do you?

01:19:55.423 --> 01:19:58.859
I mean, I- I can order dinner, but-

01:19:58.927 --> 01:20:00.861
My God, you're crazy!

01:20:00.929 --> 01:20:02.863
No.

01:20:02.931 --> 01:20:05.695
I'm just working a few things out.

01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:14.041
Go ahead. I can't go any closer,
or the door will lock.

01:20:19.581 --> 01:20:22.106
Who are you?

01:20:22.184 --> 01:20:25.119
Just a med school dropout with...

01:20:25.187 --> 01:20:27.246
you know, some issues.

01:20:27.322 --> 01:20:29.256
Is that true?

01:20:29.324 --> 01:20:31.884
Can you just say one thing that's true?

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:33.894
Okay.

01:20:37.833 --> 01:20:39.767
I did...

01:20:39.835 --> 01:20:41.769
20 perfect years...

01:20:41.837 --> 01:20:44.772
in the most difficult schools
in the country.

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:47.775
Then in my last week of med school...

01:20:47.843 --> 01:20:51.006
I got a "B"...minus.

01:20:52.547 --> 01:20:57.109
I guess when they found me
I'd been in the shower for three days.

01:20:57.185 --> 01:20:59.619
<i>My parents were mortified.</i>

01:21:00.822 --> 01:21:02.653
The next thing I remember...

01:21:02.724 --> 01:21:04.715
is your mother...

01:21:04.793 --> 01:21:07.125
sitting in my room telling me stories...

01:21:07.195 --> 01:21:09.129
about this...

01:21:09.197 --> 01:21:11.995
brilliant, loyal boy...

01:21:12.067 --> 01:21:15.764
<i>who stuck by her</i>
<i>through thick and thin...</i>

01:21:15.837 --> 01:21:20.331
<i>despite the many, many ways</i>
<i>she had failed him.</i>

01:21:21.509 --> 01:21:23.443
And then one day...

01:21:23.511 --> 01:21:25.502
there you were.

01:21:26.548 --> 01:21:29.881
And I introduced myself...

01:21:29.951 --> 01:21:31.942
sort of.

01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:36.180
<i>I lied to you.</i>

01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:40.660
A lot.

01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:43.664
But I never lied about my feelings.

01:21:45.634 --> 01:21:49.434
I gotta- I gotta go.

01:21:55.911 --> 01:21:59.847
<i>Dr. Blue, please report to Room 328, stat.</i>

01:21:59.915 --> 01:22:01.849
<i>Dr. Blue.</i>

01:22:09.391 --> 01:22:12.918
- Victor Mancini?
- You're under arrest for suspicion of rape.

01:22:12.994 --> 01:22:15.326
Rape? What are you-
I didn't ra- Oh, no. No.

01:22:15.397 --> 01:22:19.390
She asked me to rape her. It turns her on.
She even gave me the knife.

01:22:19.467 --> 01:22:21.401
- At 90?
- Who's 90? Oww!

01:22:21.469 --> 01:22:24.961
Eva Mueller, a resident
of St. Anthony's Constant Care Facility.

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:28.066
Her daughter said you held her down
and touched her woo-woo.

01:22:28.143 --> 01:22:29.972
<i>Said it was your
secret game.</i>

01:22:29.973 --> 01:22:32.739
Oh, her. I thought you were
talking about this other rape.

01:22:32.814 --> 01:22:35.214
You realize we're the police, right?

01:22:35.283 --> 01:22:38.266
I think we better go downtown
and straighten this out.

01:22:38.267 --> 01:22:39.049
Yeah.

01:22:40.689 --> 01:22:44.147
<i>Hey! Good going, Charlie!</i>

01:22:45.293 --> 01:22:47.261
Check this shit out.

01:22:47.329 --> 01:22:50.025
You gonna tell me you nailed
all these broads? <i>You?</i>

01:22:50.098 --> 01:22:53.033
We're interested in talking with a
patient by the name of Paige Marshall...

01:22:53.101 --> 01:22:55.433
in connection with your mother's death.

01:22:55.503 --> 01:22:57.164
<i>Problem is, we can't find her.</i>

01:22:57.238 --> 01:22:59.934
Apparently she'd been operating
under the delusion she was a doctor.

01:23:00.008 --> 01:23:01.999
Checked in catatonic.

01:23:02.077 --> 01:23:05.171
<i>Hadn't spoken for over a year</i>
<i>until one day your ma gave her a lab coat.</i>

01:23:05.246 --> 01:23:07.180
Staff let her wear it after that.

01:23:07.248 --> 01:23:09.910
Nobody said a word.

01:23:09.985 --> 01:23:13.182
Sounds like you made a few enemies
on the staff over there, lover boy.

01:23:13.254 --> 01:23:17.554
And you can't find her?
In a mental hospital?

01:23:17.625 --> 01:23:19.593
- Did you try her room?
- That's funny.

01:23:19.661 --> 01:23:24.564
We can't find her because she checked
herself out, you skeevy colonial dickwad.

01:23:24.632 --> 01:23:29.228
- Checked herself out?
- Turns out she was voluntary. Imagine that.

01:23:29.304 --> 01:23:31.295
You wanna tell us about the diary?

01:23:31.373 --> 01:23:33.398
It's my mom's. It's in Italian.

01:23:33.475 --> 01:23:35.568
What the hell is this?

01:23:35.643 --> 01:23:38.134
That was me when I was a kid.

01:23:39.848 --> 01:23:42.282
A long time ago, in ancient Greece...

01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:47.083
there was a young girl who fell in love
with a young boy from another country.

01:23:47.155 --> 01:23:50.090
One day word came that the young boy
would have to go home.

01:23:50.158 --> 01:23:55.095
<i>So on their last night together she
traced the outline of her lover's shadow...</i>

01:23:55.163 --> 01:23:58.098
so that she could always remember
how he looked...

01:23:58.166 --> 01:24:01.226
on the very last moments
they were ever to be together.

01:24:06.141 --> 01:24:08.905
Oh! No!

01:24:08.977 --> 01:24:11.002
Come here! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:24:11.079 --> 01:24:12.444
<i>No!</i>

01:24:12.514 --> 01:24:14.141
Oww!

01:24:18.553 --> 01:24:21.317
No! No! No! No!

01:24:21.389 --> 01:24:25.382
<i>Victor! No! No! Victor! Victor!</i>

01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:27.485
<i>Eat something, kid.</i>

01:24:27.562 --> 01:24:29.962
You look like ass.

01:24:54.289 --> 01:24:57.816
He talks about that in here.
He's faking.

01:25:01.863 --> 01:25:04.024
<i>Looks pretty real.</i>

01:25:07.602 --> 01:25:09.194
Shit.

01:25:13.641 --> 01:25:17.634
Oh, man!

01:25:17.712 --> 01:25:22.411
<i>You did not just shit</i>
<i>all over my interrogation room.</i>

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:28.756
<i> Sometimes you have to lose</i>
<i>everything before the penny finally drops.</i>

01:25:28.823 --> 01:25:30.814
You lose this?

01:25:30.892 --> 01:25:32.826
Hmm.

01:25:32.894 --> 01:25:34.885
<i>Or whatever.</i>

01:25:36.264 --> 01:25:39.199
<i>So here's what I figured out.</i>

01:25:39.267 --> 01:25:43.636
<i>We're not evil sinners</i>
<i>or perfect knockoffs of God.</i>

01:25:43.705 --> 01:25:47.505
<i>We let the world tell us whether
we're saints or sex addicts...</i>

01:25:47.575 --> 01:25:52.672
<i>sane or insane, heroes or victims...</i>

01:25:52.747 --> 01:25:56.877
<i>whether we're good mothers</i>
<i>or loving sons.</i>

01:25:59.821 --> 01:26:02.756
<i>But we can decide for ourselves.</i>

01:26:04.159 --> 01:26:06.684
<i>As a certain wise fugitive</i>
<i>once told me...</i>

01:26:06.761 --> 01:26:11.357
<i>sometimes it's not important which
way you jump, just that you jump.</i>

01:26:11.432 --> 01:26:15.630
<i>I wish I could say I'd left the
circuit completely behind me...</i>

01:26:15.703 --> 01:26:18.399
<i>but that wouldn't
be entirely true.</i>

01:26:22.644 --> 01:26:25.442
<i>I still wonder about Paige-</i>

01:26:25.513 --> 01:26:28.311
<i>another beautiful psycho</i>
<i>like my mother...</i>

01:26:29.651 --> 01:26:32.950
<i>or a twisted soul mate</i>
<i>sent to bring me back to life?</i>

01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:37.048
<i>#Disavow #</i>

01:26:37.125 --> 01:26:39.423
<i># The pleasure #</i>

01:26:39.494 --> 01:26:42.327
<i>Only one way to find out.</i>

01:26:53.741 --> 01:26:57.973
<i># You are not #</i>

01:26:58.012 --> 01:26:59.843

<i># Dare not speak #</i>

01:27:20.969 --> 01:27:25.099
<i># His name #</i>

01:27:28.109 --> 01:27:32.409
