WEBVTT

00:07.827 --> 00:09.217
Narrator: Reaching the
other side of the world

00:09.241 --> 00:10.310
has never been easier.

00:11.896 --> 00:14.413
But by flying over,
are we forgetting

00:14.517 --> 00:15.517
how to travel through?

00:19.724 --> 00:25.172
Mexico City, North
America's largest Metropolis,

00:25.275 --> 00:30.517
to ushuaia, Argentina, the
most southerly city in the world...

00:30.620 --> 00:33.172
20 hours by plane.

00:33.275 --> 00:35.310
But could you travel
the length of Latin

00:35.413 --> 00:40.482
america at ground level, and
all for the price of the airfare?

00:40.586 --> 00:42.620
Man: What have we
got ourselves into?

00:42.724 --> 00:46.137
Narrator: Five pairs of ordinary
brits are attempting just that.

00:46.241 --> 00:47.689
Let's go!

00:47.793 --> 00:52.206
Narrator: They will cover
over 25,000 kilometers...

00:52.310 --> 00:53.527
Moments like this,
you'll remember

00:53.551 --> 00:54.896
for the rest of your life.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.896
Narrator: In a demanding
and challenging race, which

00:59.000 --> 01:03.275
soars high into the andes,
crosses vast deserts,

01:03.379 --> 01:06.793
and navigates some of the
world's most volatile regions.

01:06.896 --> 01:07.793
[Dog barking]

01:07.896 --> 01:10.241
He's coming over with a gun.

01:10.344 --> 01:12.068
Narrator: Have they
got what it takes...

01:12.172 --> 01:15.689
Got no Google maps,
got no mum, got nothing.

01:15.793 --> 01:17.034
Narrator: Both physically...

01:17.137 --> 01:19.206
Someone call an ambulance.

01:19.310 --> 01:20.931
Narrator: And emotionally?

01:21.034 --> 01:23.586
We need a miracle
to get out of here.

01:23.689 --> 01:25.137
Narrator: The rewards are great.

01:25.241 --> 01:26.965
This is crazy good.

01:27.068 --> 01:28.468
This has brought
us closer together.

01:30.068 --> 01:31.748
Narrator: The first
team to the finish line

01:31.793 --> 01:36.655
will claim the prize of
20,000 pounds, in a race...

01:36.758 --> 01:38.448
Let's go. Let's go.

01:38.551 --> 01:39.665
Narrator: Across the world.

01:39.689 --> 01:40.689
Man: [Inaudible]

01:41.517 --> 01:42.896
Excitement, adventure, trauma.

01:44.724 --> 01:45.724
Oh my god.

01:51.068 --> 01:54.655
Narrator: Previously, five
teams battled through five

01:54.758 --> 01:56.344
south American countries.

01:56.448 --> 01:58.344
Woman: This is not
the best day of my life.

01:58.448 --> 01:59.724
Hang on, where's my money belt?

01:59.827 --> 02:01.034
Have you seen?

02:01.137 --> 02:02.655
Narrator: Back to back buses...

02:02.758 --> 02:04.344
We smashed two
countries in two days.

02:04.448 --> 02:07.896
Narrator: Got dom and Lizzie
to Panama City in first place.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Woo!

02:10.551 --> 02:11.241
Oh my...

02:11.344 --> 02:12.344
No way!

02:12.448 --> 02:14.148
Narrator: When Sam
began to feel the heat...

02:14.172 --> 02:15.286
Countries are hot, but I didn't

02:15.310 --> 02:16.586
think it would be this hot.

02:16.689 --> 02:18.872
I can't deal with it, I'm just
going to get a flight home.

02:18.896 --> 02:21.655
Narrator: Jo's maternal
instinct kicked in.

02:21.758 --> 02:24.206
Anything I can do to
make his journey easier,

02:24.310 --> 02:26.482
I will try and do.

02:26.586 --> 02:28.620
I don't think my uncle's
put in too much hard work.

02:28.724 --> 02:30.148
I think he's been
tossing about, to be fair.

02:30.172 --> 02:31.965
Narrator: Uncle and
nephew emon and jamiul

02:32.068 --> 02:33.931
continue to splash the cash...

02:34.034 --> 02:35.217
[inaudible] Is that
what you want?

02:35.241 --> 02:35.931
Yeah.

02:36.034 --> 02:37.034
Yeah, it's 107 each.

02:37.103 --> 02:38.724
We've got to spend
to make moves.

02:38.827 --> 02:41.379
Narrator: To leave Jen
and Rob in last place.

02:41.482 --> 02:43.137
Oh, no!

02:43.241 --> 02:44.562
I'm a little bit
gutted about that.

02:44.586 --> 02:45.896
I'm absolutely gutted.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.758
Narrator: But for
Michael and shuntelle...

02:47.862 --> 02:49.517
Michael: We had
some really bad luck.

02:49.620 --> 02:50.965
We lost our money.

02:51.068 --> 02:52.068
[Gasp]

02:52.172 --> 02:54.034
Narrator: The race
came to an abrupt end.

02:59.379 --> 03:02.241
Panama City... the
second checkpoint

03:02.344 --> 03:03.344
in the race to ushuaia.

03:08.034 --> 03:11.827
With over 17,000
kilometers still to go,

03:11.931 --> 03:14.620
the sudden departure
of shuntelle and Michael

03:14.724 --> 03:17.172
leaves four teams remaining.

03:17.275 --> 03:19.931
Lessons to be learned,
and we've got to be careful

03:20.034 --> 03:21.137
as we kind of go forward.

03:21.241 --> 03:22.965
We have to be more vigilant.

03:23.068 --> 03:24.838
Jen: It's made me realize
that that could have been us.

03:24.862 --> 03:26.724
And I'm not really
ready to go home.

03:26.827 --> 03:28.482
We need to learn from this.

03:28.586 --> 03:30.389
Rob: If that happened
to us, well, that'd be it,

03:30.413 --> 03:31.413
wouldn't it?

03:31.517 --> 03:33.044
To lose that amount
of money, it just...

03:33.068 --> 03:35.068
Jo: It just shows how
quickly it can be taken away.

03:40.448 --> 03:41.976
Lizzie: So I'll ask for
Michael and shuntelle,

03:42.000 --> 03:43.880
we've got to make sure
we don't forget anything.

03:44.862 --> 03:46.562
Narrator: Teams can
only leave the checkpoint

03:46.586 --> 03:48.482
in the order they arrived.

03:48.586 --> 03:50.448
Do you want to look
after my passport, then?

03:50.551 --> 03:53.034
The less stuff I have
to look after, the better.

03:53.137 --> 03:55.177
Lizzie: Thanks for putting
the responsibility on me.

03:56.413 --> 03:59.103
Narrator: With a two hour
lead over their closest rivals,

03:59.206 --> 04:02.000
brother and sister dom
and Lizzie are first to depart.

04:03.586 --> 04:06.448
Lizzie: Being around each
other 24/7, it's quite intense.

04:06.551 --> 04:08.103
But we're getting
used to it, I think.

04:08.206 --> 04:10.793
Although we bickered
and argued the whole way,

04:10.896 --> 04:12.862
we've still worked
well as a team.

04:12.965 --> 04:14.344
After the race,
hopefully, we can

04:14.448 --> 04:17.586
say we're not just siblings,
we're best friends, as well.

04:23.586 --> 04:24.310
Hello.

04:24.413 --> 04:25.448
Buenos dias.

04:25.551 --> 04:26.448
Thank you very much.

04:26.551 --> 04:27.379
Woman: My pleasure.

04:27.482 --> 04:28.482
Oh!

04:29.620 --> 04:31.413
Is that our next instructions?

04:31.517 --> 04:32.517
Here we go.

04:34.379 --> 04:36.758
Your third checkpoint is Quito.

04:36.862 --> 04:37.655
I know where that is.

04:37.758 --> 04:38.758
It's capital of Ecuador.

04:42.068 --> 04:45.137
Narrator: 2,000 kilometers
away, Quito, in Ecuador...

04:48.275 --> 04:52.310
The second-highest capital
in the world, at 2,850 meters

04:52.413 --> 04:53.586
above sea level.

04:53.689 --> 04:55.413
It is also the closest
to the equator.

04:57.206 --> 05:01.137
To reach it, the teams
must travel through the cities,

05:01.241 --> 05:04.689
jungles, and mountain
ranges of Colombia

05:04.793 --> 05:07.241
as they enter south
america for the first time.

05:09.620 --> 05:11.586
But there's a more
immediate hurdle...

05:11.689 --> 05:16.655
Crossing the notorious Darien
gap, a dense area of jungle

05:16.758 --> 05:19.827
stretching 160
kilometers that connects

05:19.931 --> 05:22.241
central to South America.

05:22.344 --> 05:24.344
It's considered the
most dangerous place

05:24.448 --> 05:26.275
in the western hemisphere.

05:26.379 --> 05:28.724
Ruled by paramilitary
groups, the teams

05:28.827 --> 05:30.827
will have no alternative
but to navigate

05:30.931 --> 05:32.206
around this lawless terrain.

05:33.793 --> 05:35.931
I would have quite liked
to cross the Darien gap.

05:36.034 --> 05:37.554
Lizzie: Yeah, I think
we could die, so.

05:37.655 --> 05:39.034
Yeah.

05:39.137 --> 05:41.655
Lizzie: Daily schedule
for ferries to capurgana...

05:41.758 --> 05:44.586
9:00 am, 12:00 noon, 3:00 pm.

05:44.689 --> 05:46.044
Dom: If we can get
on that 3:00 pm one,

05:46.068 --> 05:47.493
everyone's going to
be a day behind us.

05:47.517 --> 05:49.355
So I think it's pretty
important that we make it.

05:49.379 --> 05:50.413
Definitely.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.357
Narrator: East of Panama
city, on the country's

05:52.413 --> 05:56.241
Caribbean coastline,
lies the small port of tupile,

05:56.344 --> 05:59.379
where the teams can catch
a boat and bypass the Darien

05:59.482 --> 06:01.206
gap to enter Colombia.

06:01.310 --> 06:02.586
In we go. In we go.

06:02.689 --> 06:03.689
Vamos, vamos.

06:07.827 --> 06:09.320
We're not going to
make the 3 o'clock ferry.

06:09.344 --> 06:10.724
Why are you being
so pessimistic?

06:10.827 --> 06:12.103
Because it's 12:30, dom.

06:12.206 --> 06:13.872
It takes two hours
and a half to get there.

06:13.896 --> 06:15.079
So it's going to be
3:00 when we get.

06:15.103 --> 06:16.286
So? Lizzie: And it leaves then.

06:16.310 --> 06:17.689
We need to buy a ticket.

06:17.793 --> 06:19.665
Dom: There is no point getting
yourself worked up, saying

06:19.689 --> 06:20.517
we're not going to make it.

06:20.620 --> 06:21.931
Lizzie: I'm just
being realistic.

06:22.034 --> 06:23.389
Dom: But what's the point in...
Like, because you don't know.

06:23.413 --> 06:24.413
Ok.

06:25.965 --> 06:28.344
Dom: Timings aren't exact
in Central America, are they?

06:28.448 --> 06:29.448
Right.

06:29.482 --> 06:31.172
Pretty much every
single bus, taxi...

06:31.275 --> 06:32.907
Let's just end this
conversation now, dom.

06:32.931 --> 06:33.931
Ok.

06:38.689 --> 06:41.965
When we were
about 13, 14 years old,

06:42.068 --> 06:43.482
we started fighting quite a lot.

06:43.586 --> 06:44.986
And I think that's
because we didn't

06:45.034 --> 06:47.320
understand each other, and the
changes we were going through.

06:47.344 --> 06:48.379
No.

06:48.482 --> 06:50.206
Dom: I'd say now, we
definitely argue less.

06:50.310 --> 06:52.103
Lizzie: But we do
still have little spats.

06:52.206 --> 06:54.344
Yeah.

06:54.448 --> 06:55.758
There's the sea.

06:55.862 --> 06:58.689
Dom: There doesn't
seem to be anything here.

07:00.241 --> 07:01.862
We're not... we're
not friends anymore.

07:01.965 --> 07:03.765
But I feel like, to be
that close as children,

07:03.827 --> 07:05.148
there must be
something still there.

07:05.172 --> 07:06.517
And I'd love to find that again.

07:08.275 --> 07:09.620
Dom: Lo siento.

07:09.724 --> 07:11.620
We were trying to
go to capurgana.

07:11.724 --> 07:12.413
- Capurgana.
- Si.

07:12.517 --> 07:13.241
Si.

07:13.344 --> 07:14.344
Is there a ferry today?

07:14.413 --> 07:15.137
Si.

07:15.241 --> 07:15.931
What time?

07:16.034 --> 07:16.827
[Speaking Spanish]

07:16.931 --> 07:18.051
Dom: Ok.
- [Speaking Spanish]

07:18.103 --> 07:18.793
Oh, 3:30.

07:18.896 --> 07:19.896
Lizzie: 3:30.

07:20.827 --> 07:21.862
In 10 minutes. 10 minute.

07:21.965 --> 07:22.655
Dom: 10 minutes?

07:22.758 --> 07:23.758
Ok.

07:24.689 --> 07:26.113
So now, your little
hissy fit in the car...

07:26.137 --> 07:27.034
Yeah.

07:27.137 --> 07:27.724
Seems pretty
pointless, doesn't it?

07:27.827 --> 07:28.862
Yeah, yeah.

07:28.965 --> 07:31.068
I mean, to be fair,
I didn't know, did I?

07:31.172 --> 07:31.862
I feel better now.

07:31.965 --> 07:33.103
On to Colombia we go.

07:38.862 --> 07:40.448
Where did you think it was?

07:40.551 --> 07:41.413
Jo: Quito.

07:41.517 --> 07:42.379
Is it Quito?

07:42.482 --> 07:45.655
[Laughs] I am a white witch.

07:45.758 --> 07:47.068
Sam: Oh, you're so annoying.

07:47.172 --> 07:48.724
[Laughs] That's so funny.

07:48.827 --> 07:50.320
Narrator: Two hours
behind the leaders,

07:50.344 --> 07:53.551
and second team to
depart Panama City, Jo

07:53.655 --> 07:56.241
and her 19-year-old son, Sam.

07:56.344 --> 08:00.206
A big part of this adventure
is to spend as much time

08:00.310 --> 08:02.379
with my mom as I can,
as she's one of the biggest

08:02.482 --> 08:03.724
parts of my life.

08:03.827 --> 08:06.206
Jo: You're still living at
home, but in five years' time,

08:06.310 --> 08:07.550
you'll be doing your own thing.

08:07.586 --> 08:10.517
So I suppose I'm grabbing
onto him before he leaves,

08:10.620 --> 08:13.413
and having this
experience before he goes.

08:13.517 --> 08:16.482
[Crying] [Laughing]

08:16.586 --> 08:18.000
So we have to get a boat.

08:18.103 --> 08:20.010
There's only three a day,
and we two have missed it.

08:20.034 --> 08:21.634
Dom and Lizzie would
have gotten 3:00 pm.

08:21.689 --> 08:22.976
So hold on, we're
going to be getting

08:23.000 --> 08:26.793
the same one as everyone
else will be getting?

08:26.896 --> 08:27.965
Jo: Potentially, yeah.

08:29.655 --> 08:31.931
Narrator: With the last boat
of the day already departed,

08:32.034 --> 08:35.413
Jo and Sam need to leave the
comfort of the checkpoint hotel

08:35.517 --> 08:36.862
and fend for themselves.

08:38.448 --> 08:39.586
Oh.

08:39.689 --> 08:40.758
It's all right.

08:40.862 --> 08:43.000
Wouldn't choose to
come on holiday here, but.

08:43.103 --> 08:44.275
Sam: I've seen worse.

08:44.379 --> 08:46.251
Being stuck in Panama
city, it does mean that we're

08:46.275 --> 08:48.034
18 hours behind dom and Lizzie.

08:48.137 --> 08:49.724
And the others
will be closer to us.

08:49.827 --> 08:51.148
There's nothing
we can do about it.

08:51.172 --> 08:53.000
So it'll make it a
much tighter race.

09:03.137 --> 09:07.379
Narrator: Already en route
to Colombia, dom and Lizzie.

09:07.482 --> 09:09.042
It's weird, because
you wouldn't believe

09:09.137 --> 09:11.206
we're bypassing one of
the most dangerous parts

09:11.310 --> 09:13.068
of the world, the Darien gap.

09:13.172 --> 09:16.310
Because on the other
side, it's just loads and loads

09:16.413 --> 09:19.551
of tiny little paradise
islands with palm trees,

09:19.655 --> 09:22.103
white beaches, and blue water.

09:22.206 --> 09:24.310
And it is nice just to go
in-between the two of them.

09:27.275 --> 09:30.310
Narrator: The total journey
time from tupile to capurgana,

09:30.413 --> 09:32.655
the first town across
the Colombian border,

09:32.758 --> 09:33.758
is eight hours.

09:37.862 --> 09:39.142
Lizzie: I think we must be here.

09:39.172 --> 09:39.965
It's pitch black.

09:40.068 --> 09:40.862
That's all I really know.

09:40.965 --> 09:42.241
I have literally no idea.

09:42.344 --> 09:45.137
For all we know, we
could be in Jamaica, so.

09:47.448 --> 09:48.241
[Thunder]

09:48.344 --> 09:49.448
Ooh!

09:49.551 --> 09:51.724
There's some awesome lightning.

09:51.827 --> 09:53.793
Are we here at capurgana?

10:00.310 --> 10:02.482
Because it's late,
we've had to stop early.

10:05.793 --> 10:07.655
Narrator: After three
and a half hours,

10:07.758 --> 10:12.827
the siblings have reached
playon chico, 122 kilometers short

10:12.931 --> 10:14.241
of their destination.

10:14.344 --> 10:16.251
Dom: I don't think this is
attached to the mainland.

10:16.275 --> 10:17.103
Lizzie: Nope.

10:17.206 --> 10:18.655
We're literally
on a little island

10:18.758 --> 10:19.896
in the middle of nowhere.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.182
I don't even know if
we're still in Panama, or...

10:21.206 --> 10:22.034
Dom: Colombia.

10:22.137 --> 10:24.344
We're in
no-man's-land, literally.

10:24.448 --> 10:25.793
What are we going to do?

10:25.896 --> 10:28.655
Narrator: Just 383
meters wide, playon

10:28.758 --> 10:32.379
chico is one of 378
San blas islands,

10:32.482 --> 10:34.586
home to the indigenous gunas.

10:34.689 --> 10:38.344
Until the 1990s, the main form
of currency here was coconuts.

10:40.758 --> 10:42.907
I didn't... I didn't know we'd
be able to speak English here.

10:42.931 --> 10:43.931
Dom: Oh.

10:45.344 --> 10:46.103
Hola.

10:46.206 --> 10:47.344
- Hola.
- [Speaking Spanish]

10:47.448 --> 10:48.448
[Speaking Spanish]

10:48.517 --> 10:52.413
Um, do you speak
any English at all?

10:52.517 --> 10:54.275
No.

10:54.379 --> 10:55.819
We're looking for
somewhere to sleep.

10:57.586 --> 10:59.724
Do you know anywhere
where we could stay?

10:59.827 --> 11:00.862
- Si.
- Yeah?

11:00.965 --> 11:01.655
Ok?

11:01.758 --> 11:02.758
Mm-hmm.

11:04.103 --> 11:05.482
Oh, wow.

11:05.586 --> 11:06.586
[Laughs]

11:06.620 --> 11:07.448
Man: [Speaking Spanish]

11:07.551 --> 11:08.620
Oh, this is so cool.

11:08.724 --> 11:11.344
[Speaking Spanish]
Now, this is beyond what I

11:11.448 --> 11:13.241
expected about 10 minutes ago.

11:13.344 --> 11:14.344
Lizzie: Amazing.

11:15.586 --> 11:16.586
Dom: Pay tomorrow?

11:16.689 --> 11:17.379
Si?

11:17.482 --> 11:18.827
Ok.

11:18.931 --> 11:20.724
Lizzie: How did we get so lucky?

11:20.827 --> 11:23.241
Dom: The only thing is, he
hasn't told us how much it is.

11:23.344 --> 11:24.769
I think we haven't
got much option here

11:24.793 --> 11:26.379
on this little
island, so I think...

11:26.482 --> 11:28.010
We have to... we pay
what we're asked to pay.

11:28.034 --> 11:30.413
Whatever the price is,
because he's done us a favor.

11:30.517 --> 11:31.655
Yeah.

11:31.758 --> 11:34.586
[Thunder]

11:40.137 --> 11:42.482
[Rooster crowing]

11:46.965 --> 11:50.655
[Speaking Spanish]
Um, we need to pay you?

11:50.758 --> 11:51.793
Si.

11:51.896 --> 11:54.241
Um, how much is it
for [speaking Spanish]

11:54.344 --> 11:57.034
[Speaking Spanish] Yeah, good.

11:57.137 --> 11:58.793
Lizzie: 50, is that right?

12:00.896 --> 12:01.758
Si.

12:01.862 --> 12:03.034
[Speaking Spanish] Lorenzo.

12:03.137 --> 12:04.931
[Speaking Spanish]

12:05.034 --> 12:07.172
Dom: We've spent far too
much over the past two days.

12:07.275 --> 12:08.275
Lizzie: Yeah.

12:11.862 --> 12:12.551
Dom: Do you see that?

12:12.655 --> 12:13.655
Those are dolphins.

12:13.758 --> 12:15.413
And I'm not even joking.

12:15.517 --> 12:16.724
Literally right there.

12:16.827 --> 12:17.827
Lizzie: Oh, there!

12:19.034 --> 12:19.827
Oh my god.

12:19.931 --> 12:20.724
Dom: I don't want to go.

12:20.827 --> 12:22.103
I know.

12:22.206 --> 12:23.872
It's such a shame that we're
not staying here for longer,

12:23.896 --> 12:25.068
to take things slow.

12:29.206 --> 12:31.344
Emon: Third leg, here we come.

12:31.448 --> 12:34.068
Narrator: 20 hours behind
the current leaders, uncle

12:34.172 --> 12:36.379
and nephew emon and jamiul.

12:36.482 --> 12:38.448
I think from the
start of the race to...

12:38.551 --> 12:41.172
To now, I think our
relationship has become closer.

12:41.275 --> 12:43.482
But we are still learning
about each other.

12:45.310 --> 12:46.976
We have been getting
frustrated with each other

12:47.000 --> 12:48.275
in there, I'm sure we have.

12:48.379 --> 12:49.965
But you're wise,
you took a hard hit.

12:51.758 --> 12:54.103
Narrator: The pair have
spent the most money, by far...

12:54.206 --> 12:56.172
Over a third of
their total budget,

12:56.275 --> 12:58.482
with six legs still remaining.

12:58.586 --> 13:01.413
I think that we just
need to plan better.

13:01.517 --> 13:02.827
We're going to
have to work more,

13:02.931 --> 13:05.344
because so far, I don't think
he's put in too much hard work.

13:05.448 --> 13:07.344
[Laughs] The...

13:07.448 --> 13:09.137
You need to have
a captain of the ship,

13:09.241 --> 13:10.000
do you know what I mean?

13:10.103 --> 13:10.793
Jamiul: Yes.

13:10.896 --> 13:11.896
Colombia.

13:16.517 --> 13:18.448
Narrator: Too late for
yesterday's ferries...

13:18.551 --> 13:20.724
Jo: South America, here we come.

13:20.827 --> 13:24.586
Narrator: Jo and Sam make
the 116-kilometer journey to tupile

13:24.689 --> 13:25.965
for the first boat of the day.

13:28.310 --> 13:30.079
Sam: We are literally in
the middle of nowhere.

13:30.103 --> 13:32.448
I really didn't expect
there to be a border stop.

13:32.551 --> 13:33.551
Yeah.

13:35.344 --> 13:37.320
Well, I think they're telling
them to put the camera down.

13:37.344 --> 13:39.551
Yeah, it's all looking
quite... they're all army...

13:39.655 --> 13:41.000
Guns, and everything else.

13:41.103 --> 13:44.551
Feels very much like we're
going to the Darien gap, doesn't it?

13:44.655 --> 13:46.241
Put the camera down.

13:46.344 --> 13:47.172
Guys, look again.

13:47.275 --> 13:48.413
What?

13:48.517 --> 13:50.517
He's coming over with
it... coming over with a gun.

13:53.344 --> 13:57.758
Sam: I've never experienced
this sort of traveling before.

13:57.862 --> 13:59.034
Jo: [Speaking Spanish]

13:59.137 --> 14:00.758
Nothing's ever scared me.

14:00.862 --> 14:04.275
Polar bears scare
me, but nothing else.

14:04.379 --> 14:05.620
What were they checking for?

14:05.724 --> 14:06.517
I don't know. I suspect...

14:06.620 --> 14:07.965
Must have been drugs.

14:08.068 --> 14:10.251
There's cartels and things
going through the Darien gap,

14:10.275 --> 14:13.379
it would be drugs and
guns they'll be looking for.

14:13.482 --> 14:15.206
I don't think they're
looking for Internet.

14:15.310 --> 14:16.620
[Laughs]

14:21.103 --> 14:22.113
Oh, this is just beautiful.

14:22.137 --> 14:23.137
Jo: I know.

14:24.172 --> 14:26.827
Sam desperately
wants to see the world.

14:26.931 --> 14:29.448
But I'm not sure he could
quite do it on his own yet.

14:29.551 --> 14:32.034
Adios, Panama.

14:32.137 --> 14:33.827
Yeah, peace out.

14:33.931 --> 14:35.586
Bring on Colombia.

14:35.689 --> 14:39.206
It would be nice for him to
find his feet traveling with me.

14:39.310 --> 14:40.655
The best water transport ever!

14:42.965 --> 14:45.275
From my perspective,
I think only travel

14:45.379 --> 14:47.379
gives you that real excitement.

14:47.482 --> 14:52.448
And I think this probably
is the last opportunity to do

14:52.551 --> 14:53.965
a proper backpacking thing.

14:55.551 --> 14:56.551
But you never know.

15:07.620 --> 15:09.320
Lizzie: I think we must
be in Colombia, though.

15:09.344 --> 15:11.000
Should bloody well
hope so, after a...

15:11.103 --> 15:12.700
Lizzie: That took while
longer than I expected.

15:12.724 --> 15:14.724
Dom: Seven-hour boat ride.

15:14.827 --> 15:18.137
Narrator: The gateway to
South America, capurgana

15:18.241 --> 15:22.344
is a remote village
known for its quiet bays,

15:22.448 --> 15:25.172
backed by dense
rainforest, making it only

15:25.275 --> 15:27.034
accessible by air or water.

15:28.896 --> 15:30.655
Dom: What number
country is this?

15:30.758 --> 15:35.413
Lizzie: Guatemala, Honduras,
Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama...

15:35.517 --> 15:36.517
Seventh country.

15:39.448 --> 15:40.596
We're trying to go to medellin.

15:40.620 --> 15:42.034
Today? Today.

15:42.137 --> 15:42.827
Today?

15:42.931 --> 15:43.931
Yes.

15:44.965 --> 15:46.805
Today is not possible
that you'd reach medellin

15:46.862 --> 15:51.344
because our boats are leaving
before 10 o'clock the morning,

15:51.448 --> 15:52.448
all of them.

15:52.482 --> 15:53.882
Oh, there's no
roads here, is there?

15:54.689 --> 15:55.482
There's no road.

15:55.586 --> 15:56.448
[Inaudible]

15:56.551 --> 15:57.831
So you can't get anywhere today?

15:57.862 --> 15:58.965
Woman: No.

15:59.068 --> 16:00.068
At all?

16:02.137 --> 16:02.862
Well, yeah.

16:02.965 --> 16:04.896
We've lost our lead essentially.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.586
If everyone gets the 9am
boat and it arrives today,

16:08.689 --> 16:11.241
everyone will be then leaving
at the same boat as us tomorrow.

16:11.344 --> 16:12.689
Yeah.

16:12.793 --> 16:16.448
I'm quite frustrated by the fact
that we can't leave here today.

16:16.551 --> 16:18.724
But, where does
frustration get us?

16:18.827 --> 16:19.517
No, I know.

16:23.655 --> 16:26.000
from capurgana Jo and Sam.

16:27.655 --> 16:29.310
This is very nice.

midday boat, emon and jamiul.

I enjoy going on boats.

I think so.

get the last one of the day

16:40.862 --> 16:44.034
from tupile, married
couple Jen, and Rob.

Capurgana

16:48.482 --> 16:49.551
si.

16:49.655 --> 16:52.137
So you want to sleep
on there in one night?

16:52.241 --> 16:53.310
In one night.

16:53.413 --> 16:56.517
Next day, go to the
capurgana it's a long way.

16:56.620 --> 16:58.275
It's a long way?

16:58.379 --> 17:01.862
I just didn't realize that it
would take us overnight.

17:01.965 --> 17:03.551
Just a shame we
can't get further away.

17:05.103 --> 17:06.303
Last isn't a good place to be.

17:06.344 --> 17:07.620
No.

17:07.724 --> 17:11.413
But, the positive side, we
have gained on the leaders.

17:11.517 --> 17:12.517
That's not too bad.

17:13.137 --> 17:14.206
It's terrible.

17:14.310 --> 17:15.310
Wow this is rickety.

17:17.310 --> 17:19.758
We might just have to smash
a bit more cash this next round.

17:19.862 --> 17:21.379
But if it keeps
us in the game...

17:21.482 --> 17:22.206
Then,

17:22.310 --> 17:23.137
then that's...

17:23.241 --> 17:23.931
It's all good.

17:24.034 --> 17:25.137
It's all good, yeah.

it's actually really fun.

reached capurgana

stay for the evening?

18:51.655 --> 18:52.448

19:21.620 --> 19:25.137
Rob: Can we work
here to make it cheaper?

19:25.241 --> 19:29.241
We only have one option and
therefore we have to take it.

19:29.344 --> 19:30.620
Uh, can we sleep in these?

19:30.724 --> 19:32.034
Cheaper?

19:32.137 --> 19:33.838
We don't need a room, we
just need a roof over our heads.

19:33.862 --> 19:34.758
Don't we?

Jen: No, I'm really
not happy about it,

19:48.965 --> 19:50.182
but I know we've got no choice.

19:50.206 --> 19:51.586
Well, can I get my bag off then?

19:51.689 --> 19:53.182
Well, no I better keep
it on because there's

be really tough, actually.

Jen [voiceover]: I
just get miserable.

20:01.965 --> 20:03.655
I mean, I'm not very
good when I'm hungry.

20:03.758 --> 20:05.724
I'm not very good
when I'm tired.

20:05.827 --> 20:07.758

I don't know where I am.

Rob: We've always
been cautious when we're

20:19.724 --> 20:21.068
somewhere that we don't know.

20:21.172 --> 20:22.320
I just always think everybody's

Hiya.

20:28.758 --> 20:31.172
Oh I got a hit
with the locals, uh.

20:31.275 --> 20:34.379
People generally tend to kind
of get lax on holiday and a bit,

20:34.482 --> 20:35.734
you know, oh I'm
in the holiday spirit,

20:35.758 --> 20:37.206
I've had a few tequilas.

20:37.310 --> 20:40.379
Whereas, I would always pay
more attention to my bag and money.

Oh, god.

Why are you being so nice?

like this in england.

It's quite awful,

20:49.793 --> 20:51.803
actually I don't give anybody
the benefit of the doubt

20:51.827 --> 20:53.241
which is actually really sad.

20:53.344 --> 20:56.241
That's a shame but, yeah.

20:56.344 --> 20:57.344
Nice to meet you.

challenge all of those things.

21:06.724 --> 21:07.724
It is.

But you know what,
that's a good thing.

will learn to be a better person,

21:13.241 --> 21:15.310
Whenever in england that
would a kid come up to you

it was rubbing your pockets.

the leading teams
hang out in capurgana.

We've been trying to
sort of relax a bit more.

21:32.482 --> 21:34.517
We were just
intensely traveling.

21:34.620 --> 21:36.820
And if you go all out for

via the team's GPS trackers.

Oh.

Something bad's going to happen.

21:52.172 --> 21:54.551
A state of emergency
has been declared

21:54.655 --> 21:58.482
in Ecuador and travel to
that country is now forbidden.

21:58.586 --> 21:59.586
Jen: Gosh.

21:59.655 --> 22:01.793
A state of emergency
could be anything.

22:01.896 --> 22:06.517
A war, a terrorist, a
natural disaster, flood.

22:09.551 --> 22:11.931
Narrator: With no phones
or access to the Internet,

22:12.034 --> 22:14.034
the teams are unaware
of dramatic scenes

22:14.137 --> 22:15.965
unfolding at their
next checkpoint

22:16.068 --> 22:17.103
in the center of Quito.

22:20.068 --> 22:22.758
Demonstrations have
broken out all over the city,

22:22.862 --> 22:24.689
protesting
government cuts to fuel

subsidies and workers' rights.

22:28.724 --> 22:31.655
With unrest spreading, an
official state of emergency

22:31.758 --> 22:33.827
has been declared
throughout the country,

22:33.931 --> 22:37.275
shutting Ecuador's borders and
making travel to the checkpoint

22:37.379 --> 22:38.862
of Quito impossible.

22:40.689 --> 22:42.275
So you can't go
to Ecuador at all?

22:43.206 --> 22:44.246
It's quite concerning now.

22:46.034 --> 22:48.172
As a consequence,
the third checkpoint is

22:48.275 --> 22:52.172
now villavieja, tatacoa desert.

22:52.275 --> 22:53.620
Where on earth is that?

Right.

get the map, huh?

third checkpoint will

heart of the tatacoa desert.

Well that's thrown
some funds up in the air.

23:15.965 --> 23:18.586
We might have to completely
change our direction.

23:18.689 --> 23:21.517
Narrator: To reach it, the
teams have several options.

23:21.620 --> 23:24.310
Travel via the vibrant
cities of medellin

23:24.413 --> 23:27.379
and the nation's capital,
Bogota, the main bus

23:27.482 --> 23:28.642
transport hub in the country.

23:30.103 --> 23:32.551
Or, take in the
spectacular countryside

23:32.655 --> 23:34.862
the southwest has
to offer by going

23:34.965 --> 23:38.068
via Cali, famous for
its laid back dance

23:38.172 --> 23:39.793
culture and mountain views.

23:41.758 --> 23:42.931
Well, to tatacoa desert.

23:43.034 --> 23:43.724
Yeah.

23:43.827 --> 23:45.413
Wherever it is.

23:45.517 --> 23:47.277
We need to hope that
all the other teams have

23:47.310 --> 23:48.430
gone in the wrong direction.

23:50.034 --> 23:52.724
Narrator: With routes to plan
and strategies to consider...

23:52.827 --> 23:56.724
Do you know where
villavieja tatacoa is?

23:56.827 --> 23:57.862
Tatacoa.

23:57.965 --> 23:59.793
So this checkpoint
is in Colombia.

for the night in preparation

26:50.689 --> 26:51.965
Ok.

26:52.068 --> 26:53.413
Adios.

26:53.517 --> 26:55.793
Jen: Oh my days, oh
my days, oh my days.

26:55.896 --> 26:57.576
Man: Please wait for
me two minutes please.

26:57.620 --> 26:58.896
You're going in the next boat.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.103
Second boat please.

27:00.206 --> 27:00.965
Ok.

27:01.068 --> 27:02.827
What time does that leave?

27:02.931 --> 27:04.103
Man: Maybe 10 minutes.

27:04.206 --> 27:05.034
Oh, great. Great.

27:05.137 --> 27:06.137
Right. Muchas gracias.

27:08.448 --> 27:10.355
The crazy thing is that
they think we've missed it

27:10.379 --> 27:11.931
and we're here for 24 hours.

27:12.034 --> 27:12.896
Yes!
- Woo!

27:13.000 --> 27:13.689
So actually...

27:13.793 --> 27:14.517
Back in the game.

27:14.620 --> 27:17.034
We are so back in the game.

27:17.137 --> 27:18.724
Oh, and the boys,
the boys are here.

27:18.827 --> 27:20.206
We should probably
hide from them.

27:20.310 --> 27:21.527
They're not going
ahead of us now.

27:21.551 --> 27:22.655
We're in last place.

27:22.758 --> 27:24.000
We have to stay here tonight.

27:24.103 --> 27:26.413
Narrator: Under the impression
the last boat of the day

27:26.517 --> 27:28.413
has already left,
emon and jamiul

27:28.517 --> 27:30.206
are left behind in capurganá.

27:30.310 --> 27:33.310
In the morning we'll head back
out and get back on the race.

27:33.413 --> 27:35.068
We left the boys behind.

27:35.172 --> 27:36.551
Oh, man.

27:36.655 --> 27:39.241
They are going to be so upset.

27:39.344 --> 27:40.596
This is a dive shop here, is it?

27:40.620 --> 27:41.379
Yeah, [inaudible].

27:41.482 --> 27:42.965
We can go ask for a job, then.

27:43.068 --> 27:43.827
Might as well.

27:43.931 --> 27:46.068
I feel really sneaky.

27:46.172 --> 27:49.896
But then I feel really, like,
happy that I've been sneaky.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.241
Narrator: Stuck in
capurganá for 24 hours,

27:53.344 --> 27:55.689
the boys take the
opportunity to earn some cash

27:55.793 --> 27:58.000
at a local scuba diving school.

27:58.103 --> 27:59.965
All this gear is kind of heavy,

28:00.068 --> 28:02.275
so we're helping put all
the gear on our customers.

28:02.379 --> 28:03.758
Is that ok with you?
- That's fine.

28:03.862 --> 28:04.872
- Sounds good to me.
- Ok, let's go.

28:04.896 --> 28:06.389
Are you actually
going to work this time,

28:06.413 --> 28:07.424
or just make me do the work?

28:07.448 --> 28:09.413
[Inaudible].

28:09.517 --> 28:10.631
We'll be out in the sea, si...

28:10.655 --> 28:11.655
It'll be nice.

28:11.724 --> 28:13.793
I like the sea,
so I'll give it a go.

28:18.586 --> 28:20.000
The way I've been
brought up, I've

28:20.103 --> 28:23.517
always been told to try to
achieve the best I can achieve.

28:23.620 --> 28:26.413
I remember in school, if I
didn't do good in my grades,

28:26.517 --> 28:28.286
my father would just
go straight to the school

28:28.310 --> 28:31.241
and tell my teachers to put
me right at the front of the class

28:31.344 --> 28:33.344
to make sure I listened.

28:33.448 --> 28:36.448
So we're going to need
help to put the gear together.

28:36.551 --> 28:40.172
Jamiul: These things kind
of build up a way of life.

28:40.275 --> 28:44.827
And that's why winning
is the best option.

28:44.931 --> 28:47.551
If you win, you've
achieved the best.

28:47.655 --> 28:48.344
How was that, guys?

28:48.448 --> 28:49.172
Pretty good.

28:49.275 --> 28:50.275
Awesome.

28:50.379 --> 28:52.103
Emon: The last
couple of jobs obviously

28:52.206 --> 28:55.620
I've taken a backseat and
sort of overlooked everything.

28:55.724 --> 28:57.172
And this job is
completely different.

28:57.275 --> 28:59.137
It was equally shared
between me and jamiul.

28:59.241 --> 29:01.206
And we had to work hard.

29:01.310 --> 29:03.344
We did everything
together, so I enjoyed it.

29:04.758 --> 29:06.551
It shows that he
can put in the effort,

29:06.655 --> 29:08.344
and he can do the work.

29:08.448 --> 29:09.448
It's been good.

29:09.482 --> 29:10.493
Narrator: With work
done for the day...

29:10.517 --> 29:11.655
We just asked him.

29:11.758 --> 29:14.275
Narrator: But stranded
until morning, the boys look

29:14.379 --> 29:16.586
into their own [inaudible].

29:16.689 --> 29:20.275
How long is it from the
necoclí to villavieja tatacoa?

29:20.379 --> 29:21.379
Cuanto hora?

29:23.137 --> 29:24.206
Days?

29:24.310 --> 29:25.827
Here's to neiva.

29:25.931 --> 29:27.320
- Oh, so it's in neiva.
- It's in neiva?

29:27.344 --> 29:28.344
It's in neiva?

29:31.862 --> 29:32.724
Ok.

29:32.827 --> 29:35.068
Right, we've got
our route planned.

29:35.172 --> 29:36.976
Narrator: They found
out that the fastest route

29:37.000 --> 29:40.586
to the checkpoint is to
head via Medellín to neiva,

29:40.689 --> 29:43.172
the nearest major
transport hub to villavieja.

29:45.172 --> 29:46.034
[Inaudible].

29:46.137 --> 29:46.965
Ok.

29:47.068 --> 29:48.620
We're 24 hours behind now.

29:48.724 --> 29:50.344
Everybody else is ahead of us.

29:50.448 --> 29:53.137
But we're hoping to
kind of creep up on them

29:53.241 --> 29:54.724
and take them by surprise.

29:57.931 --> 30:00.344
I reckon we should
head to the bus station.

30:00.448 --> 30:02.458
Head towards the bus station
to try and find somewhere to...

30:02.482 --> 30:03.941
Why do you want to
sit by the bus station

30:03.965 --> 30:05.551
when you can sit on the beach?

30:05.655 --> 30:07.655
Narrator: Now on the
Colombian mainland, Joe

30:07.758 --> 30:09.586
and Sam, and dom and Lizzie.

30:14.103 --> 30:16.931
Narrator: With Jen
and Rob close behind.

30:17.034 --> 30:18.517
All right, let's move then.

30:21.758 --> 30:23.355
Robbie, Robbie,
Robbie, Robbie, Robbie...

30:23.379 --> 30:24.068
What's this?

30:24.172 --> 30:25.172
What, what?

30:27.103 --> 30:28.413
Go that way.

30:28.517 --> 30:30.355
Narrator: The leading
teams are taking the first

30:30.379 --> 30:32.103
bus south to Medellín.

30:32.206 --> 30:33.931
Everyone is going now.

30:34.034 --> 30:35.251
I think it's going to be better

30:35.275 --> 30:37.551
to stay here and
get on a night bus,

30:37.655 --> 30:39.034
and then we save
on accommodation.

30:39.137 --> 30:40.689
What's your
preferred idea, then.

30:40.793 --> 30:41.620
Get on this bus.

30:41.724 --> 30:43.000
I think we get the 8 o'clock.

30:43.103 --> 30:43.793
Jen: Well, we've got to.

30:43.896 --> 30:44.896
The bus is going.

30:50.551 --> 30:52.413
It's been quite nice
with Jo and Sam.

30:52.517 --> 30:53.677
I've really enjoyed it, yeah.

30:53.724 --> 30:54.793
Dom: Yeah.

30:54.896 --> 30:56.010
But we need to crack
on... Lizzie: Separate.

30:56.034 --> 30:57.034
Dom: Separate.

30:57.103 --> 30:58.286
Lizzie: We need to
go our separate ways.

30:58.310 --> 30:59.838
We should really plan
where we're going to head

30:59.862 --> 31:01.793
on to next after Medellín.

31:01.896 --> 31:03.758
I think the more
obvious route would be

31:03.862 --> 31:05.448
going straight down via Bogota.

31:05.551 --> 31:06.241
Yeah.

31:06.344 --> 31:07.862
Ok.

31:07.965 --> 31:09.965
But we want to work [inaudible].

31:10.068 --> 31:12.379
There's a job
available in guatapé,

31:12.482 --> 31:14.562
where you can help with the
horse-riding trips and I think

31:14.586 --> 31:16.827
that's something i'd
really love to do because I

31:16.931 --> 31:17.931
used to work at stables.

31:19.068 --> 31:21.689
Which is two hours
outside of Medellín.

31:21.793 --> 31:24.586
Narrator: Lizzie's plan to
top up their budget means

31:24.689 --> 31:29.793
a detour to the town of guatapé,
82 kilometers east of Medellín.

31:29.896 --> 31:31.216
I'm a little bit
scared of horses.

31:33.068 --> 31:34.965
Jo: I quite fancied
going to Cali

31:35.068 --> 31:38.241
because Cali is the
salsa capital of Colombia.

31:38.344 --> 31:42.689
It's a nine-hour bus today to
Medellín, and then from there,

31:42.793 --> 31:43.965
we go to Cali.

31:44.068 --> 31:45.379
Good?

31:45.482 --> 31:46.482
We have a plan.

31:47.620 --> 31:50.551
Narrator: Jo is aiming
to travel straight to Cali,

31:50.655 --> 31:56.206
420 kilometers beyond
Medellín, all on buses.

31:56.310 --> 31:58.758
Most of the time
I'm enjoying the race.

31:58.862 --> 32:01.379
But then quite a lot
of the time, I'm not.

32:01.482 --> 32:04.310
It's just like you go
through highs and lows.

32:04.413 --> 32:06.862
And I think with eight
weeks I will struggle.

32:10.275 --> 32:12.965
Going from Panama
to Colombia on a boat,

32:13.068 --> 32:17.413
going from the islands
and the beautiful water

32:17.517 --> 32:19.068
was absolutely amazing.

32:19.172 --> 32:22.931
But then stuff like doing the
nine-hour, 10-hour bus ride,

32:23.034 --> 32:26.827
I get so bored because
there's nothing to do.

32:26.931 --> 32:29.482
And I can't deal with that.

32:29.586 --> 32:33.965
So it's not pleasant.

32:34.068 --> 32:36.586
Do you think it's got
anything to do with your adhd?

32:38.482 --> 32:39.344
It probably does.

32:39.448 --> 32:40.586
I don't know.

32:40.689 --> 32:42.896
I've never been able to
explain why I'm anything.

32:44.620 --> 32:47.862
Jo: When I adopted Sam
when he was six months old,

32:47.965 --> 32:49.034
he was very hyper.

32:49.137 --> 32:52.620
And he was quite
disruptive at nursery.

32:52.724 --> 32:54.482
And in fact, the
nursery owner said,

32:54.586 --> 32:56.034
did his birth mother drink?

32:56.137 --> 32:57.417
And I said, well, yeah, she did.

32:57.482 --> 32:58.793
Why?

32:58.896 --> 33:01.310
And she said, oh, I've just
seen children a bit like Sam.

33:01.413 --> 33:03.379
We went off and did
a little bit of research

33:03.482 --> 33:08.275
and found this condition
called fetal alcohol disease,

33:08.379 --> 33:09.586
or fetal alcohol effects.

33:09.689 --> 33:13.655
And it was just like
reading a story about Sam.

33:13.758 --> 33:16.000
Because you get
frustrated, don't you?

33:16.103 --> 33:18.655
Well, I get frustrated
that I can't explain it.

33:18.758 --> 33:20.896
Basically, how it
affects the brain

33:21.000 --> 33:22.413
is the wiring is just off.

33:22.517 --> 33:24.896
If you said, you know,
don't touch that, it's hot,

33:25.000 --> 33:26.206
he would touch it.

33:26.310 --> 33:28.172
I'm sorry that you're
struggling with this bit.

33:28.275 --> 33:31.103
So we'll try and get
things right and try

33:31.206 --> 33:32.827
to prioritize what's important.

33:34.310 --> 33:36.000
We're going to Medellín.

33:36.103 --> 33:38.103
And is there anything
that you'd like to do there?

33:38.206 --> 33:40.827
Sam: Well, that is where
Pablo Escobar is, isn't it?

33:40.931 --> 33:42.137
Jo: Well, was, yeah.

33:42.241 --> 33:43.965
Sam: I'd really love
to go to a tour of...

33:44.068 --> 33:44.758
Ok.

33:44.862 --> 33:46.000
Well, let's do it.

33:47.413 --> 33:50.896
Can we do that, shake on it?

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
Shake on it?

33:54.275 --> 33:57.689
Narrator: Jo and Sam's new
plan, to postpone the 12-hour bus

33:57.793 --> 34:00.448
journey to Cali and
instead take a break

34:00.551 --> 34:02.482
from the race in Medellín.

34:02.586 --> 34:05.137
When I was younger, I couldn't
deal with pressure or stress.

34:05.241 --> 34:08.068
So that's when i'd
spiral off and kick off.

34:08.172 --> 34:11.793
No one ever really knew I
had fetal alcohol syndrome,

34:11.896 --> 34:13.413
but they knew I had adhd.

34:13.517 --> 34:17.034
And it was a hard
thing to deal with.

34:17.137 --> 34:19.206
On this journey, I will
just have to figure out

34:19.310 --> 34:23.068
different ways of dealing with
the stress and the pressure

34:23.172 --> 34:25.344
that comes in front of me.

34:27.448 --> 34:28.206
Right.

34:28.310 --> 34:30.482
Well, guys, this is farewell.

34:32.482 --> 34:34.068
We'll see you in a
few days probably.

34:34.172 --> 34:34.551
- Yeah.
- Bye, guys.

34:34.655 --> 34:35.862
Bye.

34:35.965 --> 34:39.965
Narrator: As the teams
separate to find accommodation,

34:40.068 --> 34:45.275
10 hours behind and just
leaving necoclí, Jen and Rob

34:45.379 --> 34:47.068
settle in for the night.

34:47.172 --> 34:49.182
If he said to me, do you want
to sleep in a bed right now

34:49.206 --> 34:51.355
or do you want to sleep on a
bus, naturally I'd take a bed.

34:51.379 --> 34:52.689
But we just have
to deal with it.

34:52.793 --> 34:55.153
It's not ideal, is it, but if we
want to stay in the game...

34:55.241 --> 34:57.793
Still be in the game, we
don't really have a choice.

34:57.896 --> 34:59.176
This is our best
option, I think.

34:59.206 --> 34:59.965
Yeah.

35:00.068 --> 35:01.517
And we are much happier for it.

35:01.620 --> 35:02.793
We're enjoying it a lot more.

35:02.896 --> 35:06.000
Well, I'm absolutely
exhausted and can't do anything.

35:06.103 --> 35:08.965
And he's taken his socks
off, and his feet stink.

35:09.068 --> 35:09.862
Rob: Give it five minutes.

35:09.965 --> 35:10.965
It'll calm down.

35:24.758 --> 35:26.241
Narrator: 6:00, Medellín.

35:29.931 --> 35:30.620
Jen: Morning.

35:30.724 --> 35:32.000
Buenas dias.

35:32.103 --> 35:35.724
Narrator: Jen and Rob are
planning for another night bus.

35:35.827 --> 35:37.827
Jen: Oh, where's he gone?

35:37.931 --> 35:38.931
What the hell?

35:41.206 --> 35:42.206
Oh, he's here.

35:43.965 --> 35:45.965
[Inaudible] Need
do it from Cali.

35:46.068 --> 35:47.448
Oh, oh!

35:47.551 --> 35:49.068
My bag is so heavy.

35:50.482 --> 35:51.206
No, I'm fine.

35:51.310 --> 35:52.344
Just leave me here.

35:52.448 --> 35:53.448
Go without me!

35:53.551 --> 35:54.965
[Chuckling]

35:57.551 --> 36:00.068
Narrator: Nestled in a
valley between the andes,

36:00.172 --> 36:03.344
the city of Medellín, the
second largest in Colombia.

36:06.482 --> 36:09.241
Once known as the murder
capital of the world due to warring

36:09.344 --> 36:12.758
drug cartels in the
1980s, in recent years,

36:12.862 --> 36:17.000
Medellín is a city reborn,
flourishing with new business,

36:17.103 --> 36:18.103
arts, and culture.

36:21.344 --> 36:23.137
So welcome to
Pablo Escobar district.

36:23.241 --> 36:26.689
I will explain the mural,
the graffiti, the pictures, and

36:26.793 --> 36:27.907
also a little bit of history.

36:27.931 --> 36:29.034
Please, after you.

36:29.137 --> 36:32.620
Jo: We just met the guys
on the Pablo Escobar tour.

36:32.724 --> 36:34.689
It's a lot of money,
particularly on a budget,

36:34.793 --> 36:36.827
but I think Sam
wants to do this.

36:36.931 --> 36:38.379
And he's fascinated by it.

36:38.482 --> 36:40.241
And I think, just
blow a bit of money,

36:40.344 --> 36:42.448
and hopefully he
gets a lot out of it.

36:44.862 --> 36:46.793
Narrator: At the height
of his grip over Medellín

36:46.896 --> 36:49.965
in the 1980s, Pablo
Escobar was one of the most

36:50.068 --> 36:52.689
powerful criminals
in history, supplying

36:52.793 --> 36:54.482
80% of the world's cocaine.

36:56.344 --> 36:58.965
This is the mural of the
members of the Medellín cartel.

37:00.724 --> 37:02.137
Sam: Over the
past couple of weeks

37:02.241 --> 37:03.734
there's been a few
things that I've missed out

37:03.758 --> 37:05.103
I've really wanted to see.

37:05.206 --> 37:08.137
And finally I'm going to
see something I want to see.

37:08.241 --> 37:10.862
So it's quite a nice
feeling that mom's

37:10.965 --> 37:12.005
listening to me, actually.

37:13.896 --> 37:18.034
So this was the rooftop
Pablo Escobar got killed.

37:18.137 --> 37:21.068
Pablo tried to escape
from the back of his house,

37:21.172 --> 37:25.586
get onto the neighbor's
rooftop, and then he got killed.

37:25.689 --> 37:28.344
It's very chilling
to know that that's

37:28.448 --> 37:29.448
where he got killed.

37:30.931 --> 37:34.517
But at the same
time, it's really cool.

37:36.758 --> 37:39.379
Narrator: 80 kilometers
east of Medellín...

37:39.482 --> 37:40.482
All right, dom.

37:40.517 --> 37:42.551
We need to find
out where this job is.

37:44.103 --> 37:46.103
Narrator: Dom and Lizzie
have arrived at guatapé.

37:47.310 --> 37:48.379
Wow.

37:48.482 --> 37:49.206
Oh, my god.

37:49.310 --> 37:50.965
Dom: This is so amazing.

37:51.068 --> 37:52.896
I wish parts of Yorkshire
were this colorful.

37:54.655 --> 37:56.965
Narrator: Often refer to
as the most colorful town

37:57.068 --> 38:02.413
in the world, it's looked
over by the pedra del peñon,

38:02.517 --> 38:05.896
a 200-meter granite
rock with a brick staircase

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
of 659 steps built into it.

38:10.448 --> 38:13.172
In its shadow, dom and
Lizzie's job for the day.

38:23.172 --> 38:23.862
So...

38:23.965 --> 38:24.827
[speaking Spanish]

38:24.931 --> 38:25.689
Sweeping.

38:25.793 --> 38:26.551
Uh-huh.

38:26.655 --> 38:27.827
Just here, or...

38:33.482 --> 38:34.241
What's that?

38:34.344 --> 38:35.344
I'm not sure.

38:35.448 --> 38:37.088
Lizzie: So basically,
it's picking up poo.

38:38.344 --> 38:40.482
They said it'd be fun
working with horses.

38:45.172 --> 38:47.413
Hopefully they haven't
eaten too much today.

38:47.517 --> 38:48.862
Ugh.

38:48.965 --> 38:54.000
I've got horse poo on my fingers
should we just sack this off?

38:54.103 --> 38:55.448
Do you just want me to do, dom?

38:55.551 --> 38:57.493
Because if you've got a
problem with the job, I'll do it.

38:57.517 --> 38:58.517
I'm willing to work hard.

38:58.551 --> 38:59.241
Ok.

38:59.344 --> 39:00.344
Bye.

39:02.965 --> 39:06.172
It's Lizzie's job
choice, so I'm going

39:06.275 --> 39:07.413
to let her clean the poo up.

39:07.517 --> 39:09.517
What, do you want money?

39:09.620 --> 39:11.310
Stop complaining.

39:11.413 --> 39:14.620
I feel like coming to
guatapé, we've gone a bit

39:14.724 --> 39:16.137
out of our way to do this.

39:16.241 --> 39:18.862
And I know we need
to earn this money back.

39:18.965 --> 39:20.344
But we have lost our lead now.

39:20.448 --> 39:22.689
So I'm not really
chuffed, to be honest.

39:25.965 --> 39:26.689
Hey!

39:26.793 --> 39:28.551
Narrator: One perk of the job...

39:28.655 --> 39:29.965
Dom, do you want to get on?

39:30.068 --> 39:31.493
Dom: Do you think
that's a good idea?

39:31.517 --> 39:32.700
Lizzie: They're
not going to run off.

39:32.724 --> 39:34.241
[Sighing] Ok.

39:34.344 --> 39:35.944
Narrator: Getting
to ride like a llanero.

39:36.000 --> 39:36.724
Lizzie: Go on, dom.

39:36.827 --> 39:38.137
Narrator: A Colombian cowboy.

39:38.241 --> 39:40.206
And then you put
your feet in the stirrups.

39:40.310 --> 39:41.510
Are you pooing yourself a bit?

39:41.586 --> 39:42.655
That's an understatement.

39:42.758 --> 39:43.758
There you go.

39:45.310 --> 39:47.389
And if you feel like you're
going too fast, just shout.

39:47.413 --> 39:47.931
I'll stop.
- Go.

39:48.034 --> 39:49.344
Come on.

39:49.448 --> 39:50.689
Oh, ok.

39:50.793 --> 39:51.827
Ok.

39:51.931 --> 39:52.931
Oh!

39:53.931 --> 39:55.379
Lizzie: So I finally
found something

39:55.482 --> 39:57.206
that I can do better
than him, and it's

39:57.310 --> 39:58.310
quite satisfying for me.

39:58.344 --> 40:00.517
[Shouting]

40:03.689 --> 40:04.448
No, no, no.

40:04.551 --> 40:05.379
This is too fast.

40:05.482 --> 40:06.517
I'm going to fall off.

40:06.620 --> 40:07.758
[Speaking Spanish]

40:07.862 --> 40:08.551
Ah, gracias.

40:08.655 --> 40:09.655
50 for me.

40:12.241 --> 40:13.137
20 for me.

40:13.241 --> 40:15.413
I put the work in, so...

40:15.517 --> 40:17.517
Muchos gracias.

40:27.034 --> 40:28.034
Welcome to Bogota.

40:31.448 --> 40:35.482
Narrator: Dominating a high
plateau 2,640 meters above sea

40:35.586 --> 40:39.448
level with modern
skyscrapers standing

40:39.551 --> 40:42.896
next to colonial churches,
Colombia's capital,

40:43.000 --> 40:46.517
Bogota, the lady of the andes.

40:46.620 --> 40:48.689
Founded by the
indigenous muisca people

40:48.793 --> 40:51.620
long before the arrival
of the conquistadors,

40:51.724 --> 40:55.586
it is now the second most
congested city in the world.

40:55.689 --> 40:58.620
Robbie, stop walking
away from me.

40:58.724 --> 41:00.310
What are you doing, chick?

41:00.413 --> 41:02.724
I just want to know
what you're doing.

41:02.827 --> 41:05.000
We're looking for a hostel.

41:05.103 --> 41:06.827
Well, [inaudible].

41:08.827 --> 41:11.689
Jen and Rob arrived
in the city at 6:00 am

41:11.793 --> 41:15.448
after two long nights
spent on buses.

41:15.551 --> 41:17.275
Hello, Buenas dias.

41:17.379 --> 41:18.689
[Speaking Spanish]

41:21.103 --> 41:22.103
Jen: 60,000 pesos.

41:22.689 --> 41:24.379
Rob: Let's keep looking.

41:24.482 --> 41:25.493
Let's keep looking for prices.

41:25.517 --> 41:26.793
What's the matter?

41:26.896 --> 41:28.458
Jen: We could be walking
around till 2:00 pm, couldn't we?

41:28.482 --> 41:29.682
Let's give it till 2:00, then.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.080
- Give it till 2:00?
- Yeah.

41:32.137 --> 41:33.137
Well, you said 2:00.

41:33.241 --> 41:34.665
That was a joke,
because then we could be

41:34.689 --> 41:35.803
walking around until 2:00 pm.

41:35.827 --> 41:36.517
All right.

41:36.620 --> 41:37.379
Let's do that, then.

41:37.482 --> 41:40.172
No, no, no.

41:40.275 --> 41:42.068
No, this is ludicrous.

41:43.724 --> 41:45.793
Almost everything is
exagerated with Jen,

41:45.896 --> 41:48.862
I think, which is... which
is part of her charm.

41:48.965 --> 41:50.217
I mean, i'm
absolutely exhausted.

41:50.241 --> 41:51.137
I've not slept for three days.

41:51.241 --> 41:52.320
I've not showered
for three days.

41:52.344 --> 41:53.493
But at the same time,
something four days.

41:53.517 --> 41:54.527
I would like to brush my teeth.

41:54.551 --> 41:56.310
I would like a glass of water.

41:56.413 --> 41:58.482
It's often explaining
that things aren't

41:58.586 --> 41:59.931
quite as bad as they are.

42:00.034 --> 42:01.079
Woman: The room is all yours.

42:01.103 --> 42:02.172
- No way.
- Oh, wow.

42:02.275 --> 42:03.000
Yes.

42:03.103 --> 42:04.379
Oh, amazing.

42:04.482 --> 42:05.931
It's the first bed
in three days.

42:08.344 --> 42:10.344
I think that's how our
relationship works, really.

42:12.034 --> 42:13.137
A dime to winning.

42:13.241 --> 42:15.689
A wish doesn't come
true if you make it public.

42:15.793 --> 42:16.793
Ok.

42:16.827 --> 42:17.867
I'll make it secret, then.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.206
Goodnight tonight's meal.

42:24.310 --> 42:25.103
I'm eating. You're not.

42:25.206 --> 42:25.896
For a dime?

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
Crikey.

42:27.931 --> 42:29.586
[Inaudible].

42:29.689 --> 42:30.724
They still stink.
- Yeah.

42:30.827 --> 42:31.827
Yeah.

42:33.241 --> 42:36.862
Narrator: Having left capurganá
24 hours after the other teams,

42:36.965 --> 42:40.586
emon and jamiul have
made it to Medellín

42:40.689 --> 42:43.689
on an important day in
the city's football calendar.

42:43.793 --> 42:44.931
The fans are amazing.

42:45.034 --> 42:46.700
You can really tell the
passion for football here.

42:46.724 --> 42:48.448
Everyone is singing
and dancing outside.

42:48.551 --> 42:51.413
Football is probably bigger
here than it is in the UK.

42:51.517 --> 42:54.275
Narrator: Local team
atlético nacional are playing

42:54.379 --> 42:56.344
their league rivals, junior.

42:56.448 --> 42:57.931
Emon: The football
is my passion.

42:58.034 --> 42:58.758
It's not jamiul's.

42:58.862 --> 42:59.982
I've seen him play football.

43:00.068 --> 43:01.620
He's got two left feet.

43:01.724 --> 43:03.827
He's really crap at football.

43:03.931 --> 43:05.371
Jamiul: I like the
hustle and bustle.

43:05.413 --> 43:07.620
I like the fans going
crazy and chanting.

43:07.724 --> 43:09.551
I'd say I'm more
of an atmosphere

43:09.655 --> 43:11.448
fan than a football fan.

43:11.551 --> 43:12.551
Cuanto es?

43:14.482 --> 43:16.172
So 55,000 each.

43:16.275 --> 43:17.424
That's our daily budget, man.

43:17.448 --> 43:18.655
I would like to experience it.

43:18.758 --> 43:21.068
But if it's the race or the
experience, at this stage,

43:21.172 --> 43:22.413
I would choose the race.

43:22.517 --> 43:23.527
Jamiul: You want to choose
the race over the experience?

43:23.551 --> 43:24.758
Yes.

43:24.862 --> 43:28.655
My uncle's put me and the
race ahead of his passion

43:28.758 --> 43:29.827
and his wants.

43:29.931 --> 43:31.137
And I'm quite moved by that.

43:33.517 --> 43:36.724
So, what, should we go to
the bus station and get tickets?

43:36.827 --> 43:39.344
Narrator: While three teams
are taking well-established routes

43:39.448 --> 43:42.206
towards the checkpoint,
the boys are looking

43:42.310 --> 43:44.827
for a more direct
bus to neiva, the town

43:44.931 --> 43:46.379
they heard about in capurganá.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.689
Right now we're assuming
that everybody else

43:51.793 --> 43:53.620
is a good 24 hours ahead of us.

43:53.724 --> 43:55.517
But I'm hoping that we
can catch up to them.

43:58.068 --> 43:59.551
No.

44:02.206 --> 44:03.724
Neiva.

44:03.827 --> 44:04.517
No.

44:04.620 --> 44:06.172
No neiva?

44:07.724 --> 44:10.172
Narrator: However finding
this less-traveled route

44:10.275 --> 44:12.068
is proving difficult.

44:12.172 --> 44:13.620
I think these guys [inaudible]..

44:13.724 --> 44:14.758
Hola.

44:14.862 --> 44:16.379
We want to go to neiva.

44:16.482 --> 44:17.206
Neiva?

44:17.310 --> 44:18.620
Neiva.

44:18.724 --> 44:24.206
[Speaking Spanish]

44:24.310 --> 44:25.000
Jamiul: 12.

44:25.103 --> 44:26.655
Oh, way down there.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.758
This'll do my head in.

44:30.862 --> 44:31.655
Emon: Hola.

44:31.758 --> 44:32.586
You go to neiva?

44:32.689 --> 44:33.689
Neiva.

44:37.931 --> 44:39.275
Quando hours neiva?

44:39.379 --> 44:40.379
12.

44:41.551 --> 44:43.827
So we get to neiva 8:00 am, si?

44:43.931 --> 44:44.724
Yeah.

44:44.827 --> 44:45.827
This is exciting.

44:46.758 --> 44:48.034
We've just spent how much?

44:48.137 --> 44:49.655
152,000?

44:49.758 --> 44:51.068
150,000.

44:51.172 --> 44:53.458
Narrator: They've managed to
find an overnight bus to neiva,

44:53.482 --> 44:56.034
a move that could help
them get back in the race.

44:56.137 --> 44:58.103
It should be 170.

44:58.206 --> 44:59.448
This is [inaudible].

45:01.586 --> 45:03.724
How did we get so lucky?

45:03.827 --> 45:06.068
[Music playing]

45:09.068 --> 45:10.793
Apparently Cali
has the prettiest girls,

45:10.896 --> 45:14.586
so I'm sure you'll
have plenty to look at.

45:14.689 --> 45:16.620
Sam: She is so embarrassing.

45:19.000 --> 45:20.689
Narrator: Jo and Sam
have reached Cali.

45:26.758 --> 45:28.689
The second largest
city in Colombia

45:28.793 --> 45:31.448
is known as the salsa
capital of the world,

45:35.344 --> 45:37.103
Sam would just like spend money

45:37.206 --> 45:40.000
and not actually
go in it, whereas we

45:40.103 --> 45:41.182
do need to earn some money.

45:41.206 --> 45:42.827
And I thought working
at the salsa bar

45:42.931 --> 45:44.034
would be really good fun.

45:44.137 --> 45:46.965
Narrator: Having overspent
and Sam's Escobar tour,

45:47.068 --> 45:48.724
Jo's hoping to earn
some money back

45:48.827 --> 45:50.034

45:52.965 --> 45:56.517
La matracka, a club the
historic cabrero district,

and tango parties.

Narrator: Jo and Sam's task...

46:11.827 --> 46:14.724
Keep the tables clean and
clear the empty glasses.

46:17.931 --> 46:19.448
It is so hard to...

46:19.551 --> 46:20.596
I don't understand any of this.

46:20.620 --> 46:21.620
What happened?

46:23.758 --> 46:24.827
[Inaudible]

46:24.931 --> 46:25.620
Sam?

46:25.724 --> 46:26.724
Yeah, one minute.

46:26.758 --> 46:28.034
One minute.

46:28.137 --> 46:30.418
Narrator: But Sam is struggling
with the language barrier.

46:32.275 --> 46:34.931
I don't understand
what they're saying.

46:35.034 --> 46:36.793
The whole place is clean.

46:36.896 --> 46:39.137
What to do is go around
all the empty tables

46:39.241 --> 46:40.103
and wipe the chairs.

46:40.206 --> 46:41.275
We've done that.

46:41.379 --> 46:43.000
Well, have you done
all these end tables.

46:43.103 --> 46:44.251
No, you've done
those end tables.

46:44.275 --> 46:46.482
No, I've done the ones
with glasses on them.

46:46.586 --> 46:48.146
So you do the empty
ones and the chairs.

46:49.931 --> 46:52.482
Sam: We're actually cleaning
stuff that's already clean.

47:09.172 --> 47:10.862
Sam: When I can't
understand anyone,

47:10.965 --> 47:13.034
I just feel like an idiot.

47:13.137 --> 47:15.620
I'm out of my comfort
zone, basically.

47:15.724 --> 47:17.551
I just hate big
crowds of people.

47:17.655 --> 47:21.068
I feel like everyone's
watching, and I don't like it.

47:21.172 --> 47:22.344
I can't deal with this.

47:23.862 --> 47:25.896
It's a discomfort
I can't explain.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.862
It's just a really
horrible feeling

47:27.965 --> 47:30.655
that you've continuously
got, like you're on your tiptoes,

47:30.758 --> 47:33.448
trying to figure out what to do.

47:33.551 --> 47:35.068
I don't know what it is.

47:35.172 --> 47:36.172
It's just me.

47:37.758 --> 47:38.448
Sam.

47:38.551 --> 47:39.896
What am I doing?

47:40.000 --> 47:41.275
I am wasting my time.

47:41.379 --> 47:43.758
I want to go now.

47:43.862 --> 47:45.344
Darling, she's
just given us a job.

47:45.448 --> 47:46.448
She's...

47:46.482 --> 47:47.700
I don't care if she's
given us a job.

47:47.724 --> 47:48.907
I know it's not a difficult job.

47:48.931 --> 47:50.275
I'm wasting my time.

47:50.379 --> 47:51.965
Jo: On the surface
it looks like he's

47:52.068 --> 47:55.586
being a petulant 19-year-old,
but I don't think he is.

47:55.689 --> 47:57.689
I just don't think he can cope.

47:57.793 --> 48:01.137
As you know, me, I
am one big problem.

48:01.241 --> 48:02.321
You're not one big problem.

48:02.413 --> 48:04.034
You're complicated.

48:04.137 --> 48:05.617
He's never been
great with big crowds.

48:07.034 --> 48:10.172
And he feels stupid if
he can't communicate.

48:10.275 --> 48:14.896
And I think this is probably
what some of those issues are.

48:15.000 --> 48:15.724
I'm out of the race.

48:15.827 --> 48:16.517
I quit.

48:16.620 --> 48:17.620
I'm done.

48:21.931 --> 48:22.931
Enough.

48:23.034 --> 48:24.034
Done.

48:24.896 --> 48:25.896
You're being ridiculous.

48:30.724 --> 48:32.931
This might be
the end of it for us.

48:54.379 --> 48:56.379
Sam: Grandma gave
me this to give to you.

48:57.275 --> 48:58.275
Oh.

48:59.655 --> 49:00.655
Do you miss her?

49:02.275 --> 49:03.275
Oh.

49:05.793 --> 49:07.586
Thinking of you all the time.

49:07.689 --> 49:09.000
Hope it's going well.

49:09.103 --> 49:10.344
Big hug to you and Sam.

49:10.448 --> 49:11.310
That's lovely.

49:11.413 --> 49:12.862
Well done for keeping a secret.

49:15.137 --> 49:18.068
I just wasn't in a
good place last night.

49:18.172 --> 49:21.517
And when I'm not
in a good place,

49:21.620 --> 49:24.517
my easiest option
to go to is quitting.

49:24.620 --> 49:27.103
Just had to clear my head a bit.

49:27.206 --> 49:28.206
Happy birthday.

49:29.586 --> 49:33.310
I don't ever like having
conflicts with my mom,

49:33.413 --> 49:34.758
but we always get through it.

49:34.862 --> 49:36.241
So I'm glad she's happy.

49:36.344 --> 49:39.000
And if she's happy, I'm happy.

Jo: Did you bring me one?

49:40.551 --> 49:41.931
Sorry, no.

49:42.034 --> 49:43.079
You get me a drink tonight?

49:43.103 --> 49:44.620
Yeah, it's on me.

49:44.724 --> 49:45.724
It's on me.

again, Jo and Sam

the closest transport

49:52.896 --> 49:53.965

49:54.068 --> 49:55.862
So yeah, back to racing.

49:55.965 --> 49:58.517
Final, final day of this leg.

49:58.620 --> 50:02.448
Narrator: 300 kilometers
lies ahead of them, much of it

50:02.551 --> 50:04.172
along winding mountain roads.

centimeters from the edge.

days to get there.

Just approaching neiva
after our 12-hour shift.

50:27.862 --> 50:30.827
Take the last little
sprint to the finish line

50:30.931 --> 50:32.896

traveling overnight

on a more direct
route, emon and jamiul

50:40.586 --> 50:41.965
are first to arrive in neiva.

50:43.724 --> 50:45.379
They must now
head north to reach

50:45.482 --> 50:49.448
the third checkpoint near
the village of villavieja,

50:49.551 --> 50:51.482
37 kilometers away.

50:51.586 --> 50:54.068
Go on. Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

50:54.172 --> 50:56.241
I'm hoping that
we've pulled up, man.

50:56.344 --> 50:57.984
All depends on how
the other teams get on.

Narrator: Departing
Bogota, Jen and Rob.

51:06.206 --> 51:10.068
Also heading to neiva,
but with a plan to get ahead.

51:10.172 --> 51:11.793
Can we get out at villavieja?

- Si.
- Si.

Will you shout, it's villavieja?

And then we get out?

an early drop off

51:23.586 --> 51:25.724
could avoid a
76-kilometer detour.

51:27.586 --> 51:30.965

like a "Mario kart" racer.

means we'll get there quick.

Narrator: Getting through
the capital's notorious traffic

51:52.413 --> 51:55.413
at rush hour means
a slow getaway.

51:55.517 --> 51:57.241
Lizzie: The traffic is awful.

51:57.344 --> 51:59.137
Dom: No mas. No mas.

52:04.206 --> 52:08.793
Rob: We could be arriving
ahead, just north of neiva.

52:08.896 --> 52:10.458
So now we've got to
cross the river, though.

52:10.482 --> 52:12.044
I don't understand how
we're going to do that.

are now just two kilometers

face a further hurdle...

52:35.793 --> 52:37.379
The magdalena river.

52:37.482 --> 52:38.620
This was a massive risk.

52:38.724 --> 52:40.206
I hope it pays off.

52:40.310 --> 52:41.517
Yeah.

52:41.620 --> 52:43.827
We haven't saved cash, but
hopefully we've saved time.

Do you?

52:47.310 --> 52:48.689
A boat just crossing
the river now.

come into a little time.

near the equator

northern and southern skies,

No way.

56:11.689 --> 56:12.482
What?

56:12.586 --> 56:13.793
They came in first?

56:13.896 --> 56:14.896
Ha!

56:16.448 --> 56:17.448
Oh, my gosh.

56:17.551 --> 56:18.758
I don't care.

56:18.862 --> 56:19.551
Amazing.

56:19.655 --> 56:21.068
Oh, my gosh.

56:21.172 --> 56:22.827
I do not believe that.

56:22.931 --> 56:23.620
Gracias.

56:23.724 --> 56:24.724
I'll close that for you.

56:24.793 --> 56:25.793
Thank you.

56:27.034 --> 56:28.103
To come first, amazing.

56:28.206 --> 56:29.241
It's an awesome feeling.

56:29.344 --> 56:31.079
Emon: Previous legs
we were being a bit fancy.

56:31.103 --> 56:32.223
That's why we made mistakes.

56:32.310 --> 56:34.310
And on this leg, we've
learned from our mistakes.

56:34.413 --> 56:36.389
Jamiul: We've been fortunate
with the people that we've met.

56:36.413 --> 56:38.551
The locals have
helped us quite a bit.

56:38.655 --> 56:41.034
Races like this can be
done on fine margins.

56:41.137 --> 56:42.217
There is no room for error.

56:43.758 --> 56:45.137
Ah!

56:45.241 --> 56:46.896
Jen: 12:20, two hours.

56:47.000 --> 56:48.000
Rob: Yeah.

56:49.344 --> 56:50.655
Jen: Yeah!

56:50.758 --> 56:53.379
I actually cannot
believe that we

56:53.482 --> 56:55.344
have gone from last to second.

56:55.448 --> 56:56.448
Oh, wow.

56:57.965 --> 56:59.044
Definitely back in the game.

56:59.068 --> 56:59.758
Yeah.

56:59.862 --> 57:01.137
I'm dead proud of us.

57:01.241 --> 57:02.896
Just little Jen and
Rob from reading.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
Boom, second.

57:07.793 --> 57:10.413
Sam: Oh, if a bug or something
jumps out at me, I'm gonna...

57:10.517 --> 57:12.620
Jo: You'll be fine.

57:12.724 --> 57:13.965
Narrator: Seven hours later.

57:14.068 --> 57:15.793
Jo: I really can't see anything.

57:18.517 --> 57:19.241
Hola.

57:19.344 --> 57:20.344
Buenos noches.

57:21.379 --> 57:22.413
Third.

57:22.517 --> 57:24.103
Jamiul and emon came first.

57:24.206 --> 57:26.137
Oh, that's brilliant.

57:26.241 --> 57:28.517
Narrator: With three teams
having made it to the tatacoa

57:28.620 --> 57:32.379
desert, emon and jamiul
are now in first place,

57:32.482 --> 57:36.206
after starting the leg 20
hours behind the leaders.

57:36.310 --> 57:38.896
Jo: We sort of expected
to come third or fourth,

57:39.000 --> 57:42.206
because we took a
slightly circuitous route.

57:42.310 --> 57:43.620
I mean, the roads were just...

57:43.724 --> 57:44.413
Horrible.

57:44.517 --> 57:45.241
Rubbish.

57:45.344 --> 57:46.655
Where's Liz and dom, then?

57:46.758 --> 57:47.517
I know.

57:47.620 --> 57:48.620
That's amazing.

57:55.034 --> 57:57.620
I feel like maybe
if we do come last,

57:57.724 --> 58:00.448
it'll be a good kick up
the ass for the next leg.

58:00.551 --> 58:02.448
Might make me race a bit harder.

58:02.551 --> 58:04.275
Lizzie: I hope so.

58:04.379 --> 58:06.620
Anyway, we're not going
to have that discussion now.

58:06.724 --> 58:07.413
Let's just go.

58:07.517 --> 58:08.517
Ok.

58:09.448 --> 58:10.793
Don't start, Lizzie.
- No, no.

58:10.896 --> 58:12.056
That's why I said let's stop.

58:17.758 --> 58:19.344
Narrator: Next time...

58:19.448 --> 58:20.172
[inaudible]

58:20.275 --> 58:21.517
Bring it on.

58:21.620 --> 58:24.655
Narrator: The teams plunge
into deepest, darkest Peru.

58:24.758 --> 58:26.517
It's exhausting.

58:26.620 --> 58:27.965
Oh, look at you!

58:28.068 --> 58:29.482
Narrator: And
the sky's the limit.

58:29.586 --> 58:30.793
I can do this.

58:30.896 --> 58:32.344
I can do a hell of a lot more.

58:32.448 --> 58:33.448
[Laughing]

58:34.310 --> 58:36.724
[Inaudible]

58:36.827 --> 58:38.827
[Theme music]

59:11.655 --> 59:12.655
