WEBVTT

00:06.807 --> 00:09.143
Jocelyn: Moira, I'm sorry
I couldn't be more available

00:09.177 --> 00:10.511
for you today, it's just
that my sister was supposed

00:10.544 --> 00:12.213
to organize this with me,

00:12.246 --> 00:14.082
and her husband has come down
with gout for the third time.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.616
But I still think this
is gonna be the best

00:15.649 --> 00:17.618
Asbestos Fest yet!
- You know,

00:17.651 --> 00:20.121
I know all about being left
in the lurch for a fundraiser.

00:20.154 --> 00:22.656
Eva Longoria and I were
supposed to perform

00:22.690 --> 00:25.793
our ventriloquist act for
the "Everybody Nose" benefit

00:25.826 --> 00:27.661
for juvenile rhinoplasty,

00:27.695 --> 00:30.764
when she suddenly drops out
due to exhaustion.

00:30.798 --> 00:33.467
I had to be both puppet,
and puppeteer.

00:33.501 --> 00:35.269
- Okay, you know what, Moira?

00:35.303 --> 00:36.837
There's just a lot
going on right now.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.506
I've got a list of three
different numbers

00:38.539 --> 00:39.807
that you're choosing from,

00:39.840 --> 00:42.176
and what would really be
helpful to everyone,

00:42.210 --> 00:43.711
and when I say everyone,
I mean me,

00:43.744 --> 00:45.479
is if you could just
nail down which one

00:45.513 --> 00:47.348
you're gonna perform tonight.

00:47.381 --> 00:50.351
I did get the set list from the
children's choir two weeks ago.

00:50.384 --> 00:54.688
- I... the easiest to go with
is probably

00:54.722 --> 00:57.458
"Shoes, Glorious Shoes,
the Imelda Marcos Story."

00:57.491 --> 00:59.860
- Okay.
- Never mind.

00:59.893 --> 01:03.764
I am going to dust off...
"Two Heads Are Better".

01:03.797 --> 01:05.266
- The one woman
Siamese twin play.

01:05.299 --> 01:07.235
- Yes- no!

01:07.268 --> 01:09.103
No, you know what?

01:09.137 --> 01:10.738
I am going to resurrect...

01:10.771 --> 01:14.542
"One Crazy Summer,
The Patty Hearst Story."

01:14.575 --> 01:16.677
It's a tale of perseverance,
much like your quest

01:16.710 --> 01:19.180
to bring asbestos back
to the town.

01:19.213 --> 01:20.414
- Okay, well first of all,
we're trying to get rid

01:20.448 --> 01:22.583
of the asbestos, Moira,

01:22.616 --> 01:24.852
and we really just need you
to make a decision, now.

01:24.885 --> 01:25.853
- Okay!
- Now!

01:25.886 --> 01:29.623
- Well, let me think!
Uh... "Two Heads" it is.

01:29.657 --> 01:31.792
The Foxwood Casino Gazette
did say

01:31.825 --> 01:34.695
it was a performance
they'd never seen before.

01:34.728 --> 01:36.864
Don't write that down.
- Okay Moira,

01:36.897 --> 01:39.200
I just wanna slap you
right across the face.

01:39.233 --> 01:40.768
- Patty it is! Patty.

01:43.904 --> 01:46.774
Although Jocelyn, I'm wondering,

01:46.807 --> 01:49.543
does "TV's Moira Rose" send
a different message

01:49.577 --> 01:52.580
than "television's Moira Rose?"

01:54.448 --> 01:57.218
Something to think about?

01:57.251 --> 01:59.253
I said, something
to think about!

01:59.287 --> 02:01.422
(Low hum of chatter)

02:03.191 --> 02:04.425
Hello, you.

02:05.526 --> 02:09.463
♪♪♪

02:14.968 --> 02:17.538
- Oh hi, David.
- Hi.

02:17.571 --> 02:19.507
- I believe you said I could
have your room for the day,

02:19.540 --> 02:21.775
to rehearse my act
for the fundraiser.

02:21.809 --> 02:24.478
- Oh, you meant like,
like right now?

02:24.512 --> 02:28.316
Okay. Um...
what did you decide on?

02:28.349 --> 02:31.319
- Well, at this very moment
it's 1974,

02:31.352 --> 02:33.721
and this room
is a San Franciscan bank.

02:33.754 --> 02:35.889
- You're going with
the Patty Hearst story?

02:35.923 --> 02:38.892
- Yes, I am.

02:38.926 --> 02:40.361
And what's wrong with that?

02:40.394 --> 02:42.463
- Well, didn't it have
an ensemble cast of 30?

02:42.496 --> 02:44.332
- Uh huh, and what was
your father's review?

02:44.365 --> 02:46.667
29 dead weights! (Laughs)

02:46.700 --> 02:48.369
So I trimmed the fat.

02:48.402 --> 02:49.870
- You didn't even play Patty,
though.

02:49.903 --> 02:51.739
- You know I did!

02:51.772 --> 02:54.475
The night Patricia Lupone
ate that pre-show shwarma,

02:54.508 --> 02:57.345
and I was asked to step in.

02:57.378 --> 02:59.980
I've always wanted
to reprise the role!

03:00.013 --> 03:02.583
- I just recall that that show
was very heavy on the footwork

03:02.616 --> 03:04.952
and at one point you yelled,
"Line!"

03:04.985 --> 03:06.720
in the middle of a dance
break.

03:06.754 --> 03:08.656
- Okay, some of these
townspeople

03:08.689 --> 03:10.891
are going to experience
my triad of threats

03:10.924 --> 03:12.826
for the first time, David.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.396
Nothing less than spectacular
can do for them!

03:15.429 --> 03:18.632
- Okay. I just remember you
practicing every day

03:18.666 --> 03:20.768
for seven months with that
dance instructor

03:20.801 --> 03:22.470
that I ended up dating.

03:22.503 --> 03:25.005
Are you sure you
remember it all?

03:25.038 --> 03:28.476
- Skip Fosse once told me that
when it comes to choreo,

03:28.509 --> 03:30.878
always leave some room
for spontaneity.

03:30.911 --> 03:33.681
- Okay.
- Okay, you know what?

03:33.714 --> 03:35.716
If you feel it's necessary,
fine,

03:35.749 --> 03:37.485
I won't stand in the way
of you spotting.

03:37.518 --> 03:38.952
- Well unfortunately,
I can't spot you now,

03:38.986 --> 03:40.621
because now I have to go
to work.

03:40.654 --> 03:43.924
- Oh, then go to work!
- Okay. Good luck.

03:43.957 --> 03:45.626
- No, you say, "break a leg."

03:45.659 --> 03:47.461
- Okay, that, too.
- Say "break a leg!"

03:47.495 --> 03:50.298
- Break a leg!
(Door slams)

03:50.331 --> 03:53.867
- Okay, here. Ahem!
We're going to ease in...

03:53.901 --> 03:56.236
with a machine gun ballet.

03:58.038 --> 04:00.240
(Low hum of chatter)

04:03.076 --> 04:04.712
- Hi, sorry.
Boys: Hey! This guy!

04:04.745 --> 04:07.348
- Excuse me, hey. Hey, yeah.
What's up. Yeah...

04:07.381 --> 04:09.383
- And we mark up
the retail price.

04:09.417 --> 04:11.519
- Okay.
- What are you doing here?

04:11.552 --> 04:13.354
- Patrick has offered to help
me with this school assignment

04:13.387 --> 04:15.055
I told you that, David.
- Hi.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.057
Um, you did not tell me that.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.826
- Yeah, how are your friends
doing outside?

04:18.859 --> 04:21.762
- They're harmless, thanks.
- Are they? Cool.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.531
- Um, we're actually just
in the middle of something,

04:23.564 --> 04:25.566
so if you wouldn't mind...
- I would mind, but--

04:25.599 --> 04:28.536
- Okay, so, profit margins.
- Mhmm?

04:28.569 --> 04:30.838
- Um, how do you get
more of those?

04:30.871 --> 04:33.341
- Well, you'd start by telling
the group of teens

04:33.374 --> 04:35.443
that hang out outside your
store every afternoon

04:35.476 --> 04:37.778
to leave because they're
scaring off actual customers.

04:37.811 --> 04:41.515
- Okay, they're not
scaring off customers,

04:41.549 --> 04:43.851
there was one that looked
meth-y.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.786
And I don't know
where he went.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.555
- See, your brother doesn't
wanna tell them off.

04:47.588 --> 04:49.457
Which is, and you can
write this down,

04:49.490 --> 04:51.459
a financial liability.
- Liability.

04:51.492 --> 04:55.329
- Incorrect!
The fact that we have youths

04:55.363 --> 04:58.031
minding their own business
in front of our store

04:58.065 --> 05:00.067
builds, and you can
write this down--

05:00.100 --> 05:02.503
- No.
- street cred.

05:02.536 --> 05:04.772
- Okay, are they actually
buying anything?

05:04.805 --> 05:09.076
- Yes! They're coming in,
and they're buying gum.

05:09.109 --> 05:11.412
- And what else are they
doing, David?

05:11.445 --> 05:14.615
- They're coming in,
they're looking around,

05:14.648 --> 05:16.950
and they're buying gum.
- (Gasps)

05:16.984 --> 05:19.920
- And maybe complimenting
my outfits.

05:19.953 --> 05:22.456
- There it is!
- No, there what is?

05:22.490 --> 05:25.125
I'm sorry that you connect
with a more mature clientele,

05:25.158 --> 05:28.429
whereas I vibe
with a much younger crowd.

05:28.462 --> 05:30.464
- Oh. (Scoffs)
(Door bell jingles)

05:31.632 --> 05:34.535
- Nice sweater, bro!
- Um... God, I--

05:36.504 --> 05:38.939
this is so old, and I can't
even remember where I got it.

05:38.972 --> 05:41.041
Do you guys remember-sorry,
where I got this sweater?

05:42.976 --> 05:45.112
- What just happened to you?
- Huh?

05:45.145 --> 05:46.914
- Like, breathe it out.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.682
(Door shuts)

05:48.716 --> 05:50.083
Roland: Hey there, Johnny!

05:50.117 --> 05:52.520
Just so you know,
I'm obviously a beer guy,

05:52.553 --> 05:55.022
but I've never been known
to turn down

05:55.055 --> 05:57.090
a fresh bouquet of flowers...

05:57.124 --> 05:58.759
- Roland, what are you
talking about?

05:58.792 --> 06:01.495
- Well, you are gonna be
thanking me pretty soon

06:01.529 --> 06:02.730
for saving your bacon,
so I just thought

06:02.763 --> 06:06.467
I'd give you some gift ideas.
- I'm kinda busy right now.

06:06.500 --> 06:09.503
- Yeah, I can see that.
Very busy, right, Johnny?

06:09.537 --> 06:11.939
Apparently too busy
to change the bulb

06:11.972 --> 06:13.941
that's burned out
over room three.

06:13.974 --> 06:16.143
- Roland, I fail to see how
pointing out problems here

06:16.176 --> 06:18.111
is saving my bacon.

06:18.145 --> 06:20.080
- I know a guy who needs
some work,

06:20.113 --> 06:21.849
and I told him
I'd do him a favour,

06:21.882 --> 06:24.785
and get him a job right here
in the motel, so...

06:24.818 --> 06:26.920
- Uh huh. And why does it
sound like I'd be the one

06:26.954 --> 06:28.656
doing your friend the favour?

06:28.689 --> 06:30.458
- Well Johnny,
I'm the middle man,

06:30.491 --> 06:32.993
I'm the one that kind of made
this all happen.

06:33.026 --> 06:35.463
- Well, nothing's happened,
so you can tell your friend

06:35.496 --> 06:37.465
we can't afford him.
- (Sighs)

06:37.498 --> 06:39.900
- You know, when I started
Rose Video we had one employee

06:39.933 --> 06:42.503
per store working start
to close,

06:42.536 --> 06:44.505
so keeping an eye
on the bottom line,

06:44.538 --> 06:46.173
that's how a young
business grows.

06:46.206 --> 06:47.675
- Uh huh...
- Besides,

06:47.708 --> 06:50.511
Stevie and I are managing
just fine on our own.

06:50.544 --> 06:52.713
- All I'm saying is keep
an open mind, okay?

06:52.746 --> 06:54.548
It might be nice
to have a guy around here

06:54.582 --> 06:56.917
who has some basic skills
for a change.

06:56.950 --> 07:00.821
And I'm sorry, but we all know
how Rose Video turned out!

07:00.854 --> 07:04.625
- You know, Rose Video was the
second largest video chain in-

07:04.658 --> 07:06.560
(Door slams)
Oohhh!

07:06.594 --> 07:08.562
- Did you ask him why he's been
wandering around with a notepad,

07:08.596 --> 07:10.197
it's really starting
to creep out the guests.

07:10.230 --> 07:12.065
- Yeah, he's pitching a guy
he knows to help out

07:12.099 --> 07:13.901
around the motel,
but don't worry,

07:13.934 --> 07:17.037
I told him that we're a well
oiled machine at this point.

07:17.070 --> 07:19.607
- Yeah, that I've been greasing.

07:19.640 --> 07:22.710
Your new policy about helping
the guests with the bags--

07:22.743 --> 07:24.177
- Yeah, and you know, we're
getting very good feedback

07:24.211 --> 07:26.213
about that on the comment cards.

07:26.246 --> 07:28.115
- But I've been the one
carrying them,

07:28.148 --> 07:30.651
because "somebody"
has a bad back.

07:30.684 --> 07:32.653
- Well Stevie, if I lift
a roll of toilet paper,

07:32.686 --> 07:34.655
you know, it... flares up.

07:34.688 --> 07:36.590
- Okay well, I'm starting
to look like

07:36.624 --> 07:39.026
a Slovakian shot putter,
so I'm with Roland.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.828
We're gonna be hiring
someone else.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.998
(Car rumbles)

07:47.901 --> 07:49.102
- Thanks, bro.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.471
Come back again soon, guys.

07:53.641 --> 07:54.742
- Great sale, bro.

07:54.775 --> 07:57.645
Four teens, one pack of gum,
which you gift wrapped.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.212
Hey, why don't we just
close the store up,

07:59.246 --> 08:01.248
and celebrate for the rest
of the day?

08:01.281 --> 08:03.183
- I'll have you know that
it was one pack of gum,

08:03.216 --> 08:05.786
and one lip balm.
- Oh!

08:05.819 --> 08:07.054
- (Gasps) Well, that'll make
up for all the stuff

08:07.087 --> 08:09.256
they've been stealing.

08:09.289 --> 08:11.291
- I'm sorry?
- What do you mean, stealing?

08:11.324 --> 08:14.027
- Those kids are one hundred
percent stealing from you.

08:14.061 --> 08:16.730
- I don't think so.
- (Scoffs)

08:16.764 --> 08:19.266
- Okay. They split up into
four different directions,

08:19.299 --> 08:22.169
one takes the back left
corner, one takes the right,

08:22.202 --> 08:24.838
one of them asks you if you
have those wool hoodies

08:24.872 --> 08:26.607
in a different size,

08:26.640 --> 08:29.042
while the last one compliments
you on your cuticle game.

08:29.076 --> 08:30.878
And while you're lapping
all that up,

08:30.911 --> 08:32.546
the two in the back corner
are filling their backpacks

08:32.580 --> 08:34.815
full of facial cleanser.

08:34.848 --> 08:37.250
It's the exact same move that
I used with my klepto friends

08:37.284 --> 08:38.986
in the Hamptons.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.821
- I-I feel like I would've
seen that.

08:40.854 --> 08:43.156
- Yeah, I mean, maybe that's
what you and your burnout

08:43.190 --> 08:45.158
friends did at the Miss Sixty
store,

08:45.192 --> 08:47.027
but that's not what's
happening here.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.162
- Okay. Why don't you go check,
then?

08:59.272 --> 09:00.974
- I can't tell if there's
product missing,

09:01.008 --> 09:02.676
or if we just haven't
replenished.

09:02.710 --> 09:04.745
I feel like if someone
were robbing our store

09:04.778 --> 09:07.080
we would know about it, right?
- Uh yeah, we would know.

09:07.114 --> 09:09.016
- Though this would explain
the compliments.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.351
- That's--
- What?

09:11.384 --> 09:14.054
- Give it an hour,
they'll be back.

09:14.087 --> 09:15.756
They only took the toner
and the cleanser,

09:15.789 --> 09:17.858
and if they're not selling it
on the black market,

09:17.891 --> 09:20.761
then they'll need to come back
and get the moisturizer,

09:20.794 --> 09:22.562
or their t-zones are going
to be like, super effed!

09:26.934 --> 09:28.335
Roland: Johnny,
I gotta say, uh,

09:28.368 --> 09:30.203
I'm glad you came around
to your senses,

09:30.237 --> 09:31.338
and may I tell you something,

09:31.371 --> 09:33.807
I don't feel like you're less
of a man

09:33.841 --> 09:35.308
because you need a little help
with your business.

09:35.342 --> 09:36.944
- Yeah, that's good to know,
Roland.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.345
So where's the guy?

09:38.378 --> 09:40.914
- Oh he'll be here,
don't you worry.

09:40.948 --> 09:43.617
Mr. Worry! (Laughs)

09:43.651 --> 09:45.653
And I think you're really
going to like him,

09:45.686 --> 09:49.056
he's very smart,
he's devilishly handsome,

09:49.089 --> 09:50.824
and he stands about yay tall,

09:50.858 --> 09:53.293
maybe a little bit
more like that.

09:53.326 --> 09:55.262
- Okay, I see where
this is going.

09:55.295 --> 09:57.731
- Or do you?
- Roland what are we doing here?

09:57.765 --> 10:00.367
- Johnny, it's me!
I'm the guy!

10:00.400 --> 10:02.102
- I know you're the guy,

10:02.135 --> 10:04.271
I got that as soon as I said
where's the guy?

10:04.304 --> 10:06.173
- Oh my god, you should see
the look on your face!

10:06.206 --> 10:08.375
- Impatience, that's the look!

10:08.408 --> 10:11.344
All right, we do need help at
the motel, we do need someone,

10:11.378 --> 10:13.213
but someone who is going
to pitch in,

10:13.246 --> 10:14.648
and do some of the grunt work.

10:14.682 --> 10:16.950
- And I am willing to roll up
my sleeves,

10:16.984 --> 10:18.886
and help out my best friend!

10:18.919 --> 10:20.187
- Okay, I gotta go.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.388
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
No, no, no, no!

10:21.421 --> 10:23.323
Now I wasn't joking
about my skills, pal!

10:23.356 --> 10:25.358
Come on, what do you say
we give it a shot?

10:25.392 --> 10:27.060
- I don't think so, no.
- Huh? Going once.

10:27.094 --> 10:28.295
Going twice.
- No.

10:28.328 --> 10:29.730
- Going 3 times.
- Roland! All right.

10:29.763 --> 10:31.799
- Going 4 times.
Going 5 times--

10:31.832 --> 10:34.267
- All right, all right,
all right. All right. Fine.

10:34.301 --> 10:37.370
But only because we could
actually use some help.

10:37.404 --> 10:40.240
- That's a smart move, Johnny.
- But consider this a trial.

10:40.273 --> 10:42.242
- Yeah, that's probably
a good idea,

10:42.275 --> 10:43.877
I don't wanna commit
until I know I like it.

10:50.951 --> 10:53.453
- (Sings) ♪ Stick 'em up!
This is a holdup! ♪

10:53.486 --> 10:55.923
♪ Nobody move but me-me-me-me!

10:58.826 --> 11:00.427
♪ But me!

11:00.460 --> 11:02.262
(Knocking)
Who goes there?

11:02.295 --> 11:04.832
- It's Jocelyn.
- Oh!

11:04.865 --> 11:07.234
- Good news, Moira,
don't ask me why,

11:07.267 --> 11:08.802
but Gwen had a hunting rifle
in her basement,

11:08.836 --> 11:10.938
and I'm hoping this is good
for your act!

11:10.971 --> 11:12.806
- Um, it was a machine gun.

11:14.174 --> 11:17.177
So I need a machine gun
for the machine gun ballet!

11:18.912 --> 11:20.948
- Okay Moira, you've got
to meet me halfway here,

11:20.981 --> 11:22.716
this is a real gun!
- What?

11:24.151 --> 11:26.319
- And I got you extra
performance time,

11:26.353 --> 11:29.122
I got the children's choir
down to one song!

11:29.156 --> 11:32.425
Some of the kids cried.
- Oh, Jocelyn.

11:32.459 --> 11:34.928
Jocelyn, why? Why, why,
why, would you do that?

11:34.962 --> 11:37.064
- Because you asked
for more time, Moira!

11:37.097 --> 11:39.432
- But... Jocelyn!

11:39.466 --> 11:42.169
Did you know that rehearsal,

11:42.202 --> 11:44.337
it can be the most enlightening

11:44.371 --> 11:46.306
and even heuristic exercise.

11:46.339 --> 11:49.142
- What are you saying?

11:49.176 --> 11:52.846
- I'm saying I am stepping out
of the limelight, Jocelyn.

11:52.880 --> 11:56.449
- But we already re-printed
the posters

11:56.483 --> 12:00.520
from "TV's Moira Rose,"
to "Television's Moira Rose!"

12:00.553 --> 12:02.455
- And that's great,
that will get them in the door

12:02.489 --> 12:04.357
and then the kids
take over from there!

12:04.391 --> 12:06.860
That's...
- Okay.

12:06.894 --> 12:08.929
I see what's going on here.

12:10.363 --> 12:12.866
Somebody's got cold feet.
- Ha ha.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.301
Blocks of ice. Mhmm.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.504
I bit off more
than I could chew.

12:17.537 --> 12:21.174
- You know what, Moira,
we have all been there.

12:21.208 --> 12:23.844
Yeah. On my wedding day,
I thought,

12:23.877 --> 12:26.346
what if I just got in my car
and drove to New Mexico,

12:26.379 --> 12:29.016
and left Roland at the altar
at the Elmdale Bingo Hall?

12:29.049 --> 12:31.852
Bottom line,
I got cold feet too,

12:31.885 --> 12:34.187
and I faced my fears,
and now look at us!

12:34.221 --> 12:36.857
27 years of bliss.

12:36.890 --> 12:39.492
- Was I to perceive something
encouraging within that...

12:39.526 --> 12:42.029
little anecdote?

12:42.062 --> 12:45.398
- Okay, you know what, Moira,
pull it together.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.200
I'm taking this gun.

12:50.303 --> 12:52.906
- Okay, Patty, come on, Patty!
(Door slams)

12:52.940 --> 12:56.043
Patty, the eyes of the lonely
world are on you!

12:58.311 --> 13:01.048
So, five, six, seven, eight,
Patty!

13:01.081 --> 13:03.050
(Thumps)

13:03.083 --> 13:04.551
Five, six, seven, eight!

13:05.919 --> 13:07.187
Nine, ten-nine--

13:08.588 --> 13:10.523
nine, ten, eleven, twelve!

13:10.557 --> 13:13.360
♪♪♪

13:13.393 --> 13:15.095
(Slow Jazz tune plays)

13:15.128 --> 13:17.898
- (Sighs)
- Like clockwork, David.

13:19.199 --> 13:21.068
Hey!
- Yeah.

13:21.101 --> 13:24.371
- Hey! Can I help you guys
with anything, or...?

13:24.404 --> 13:26.206
- No, we're just looking.

13:26.239 --> 13:28.942
- Okay, cool.
Cool, cool, yeah, yeah.

13:28.976 --> 13:31.945
Look around. You do you.

13:31.979 --> 13:34.547
- Uh, hey, do you have
this in like,

13:34.581 --> 13:36.950
a larger size, maybe?

13:36.984 --> 13:38.385
- I don't know, I'll have
to go all the way

13:38.418 --> 13:40.220
into the back to check.

13:43.556 --> 13:46.059
- Hey, man!
- (Gasps)

13:46.093 --> 13:47.861
- I like your shoes,
where'd you get them?

13:47.895 --> 13:50.197
- Oh! Oh...
- Oh! Um, these?

13:50.230 --> 13:52.432
I got these at a boutique
in Prague

13:52.465 --> 13:54.501
that's only open
on Sunday nights.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.536
- Cool.
- Is it?

13:56.569 --> 13:59.572
- Uh hey, I think
we're gonna head.

13:59.606 --> 14:02.976
- Oh, um wait, but-you forgot
something, though.

14:05.112 --> 14:06.546
- What?!

14:06.579 --> 14:08.248
- Look, please don't do
anything crazy,

14:08.281 --> 14:09.983
it took me so long
to make that.

14:10.017 --> 14:11.418
- Well, I'll be happy
to give it back,

14:11.451 --> 14:13.653
when you and your skid mark
friends give back

14:13.686 --> 14:15.255
all of the products
that you've stolen.

14:15.288 --> 14:16.656
And if I'm being honest,

14:16.689 --> 14:18.325
someone with your combination
of skin

14:18.358 --> 14:20.260
should really be using product
with tea tree oil in it.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.030
- I...

14:25.365 --> 14:27.134
- Hand it over.

14:27.167 --> 14:29.069
- I thought she was too cool
to work here.

14:29.102 --> 14:32.239
- I don't work here,
and I am really cool, so.

14:32.272 --> 14:35.008
Don't do it again,
and I won't call the po po.

14:35.042 --> 14:37.077
- Did she say po po?
- Okay! Okay!

14:37.110 --> 14:38.578
I think we're done here.

14:38.611 --> 14:40.413
- Okay, I just have one
more question.

14:40.447 --> 14:43.416
All those compliments,
and fist pumps--

14:43.450 --> 14:45.118
- Bumps.
- Shut up.

14:45.152 --> 14:47.287
Was that just part
of the big scheme?

14:47.320 --> 14:49.589
- No, you have cool style.
- I like your shoes.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.925
- They're lying to you, David,
they're lying, they're lying.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.195
- Okay, get out.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.430
(Teenagers mutter)
- Right, so...

14:58.531 --> 15:01.935
- (Sighs)

15:01.969 --> 15:03.503
Ugh...
- What? Why me?

15:03.536 --> 15:05.305
- I just feel really gross.
- Why did I get one?

15:07.540 --> 15:09.309
- Okay, so there's window
repair in room four.

15:09.342 --> 15:11.011
- Mhmm...

15:11.044 --> 15:12.645
- And then the bathroom in
room 5 still needs to be done.

15:12.679 --> 15:13.813
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:13.846 --> 15:17.184
- Can you handle that?
- No, I am just waiting to hear

15:17.217 --> 15:19.186
something that's
in my wheelhouse.

15:19.219 --> 15:23.523
- Okay uh, why don't you just
start by changing the sheets?

15:23.556 --> 15:26.493
- Honey, that kinda sounds
like a Johnny job to me.

15:26.526 --> 15:29.162
Why don't we just put
a "J" next to that.

15:29.196 --> 15:32.599
- No, no, no! We're putting
an "R" next to that,

15:32.632 --> 15:36.003
Roland, I thought you said you
had no problem doing grunt work.

15:36.036 --> 15:38.538
- Well Johnny, how's it going
to look to have the mayor

15:38.571 --> 15:40.640
of the town changing sheets?

15:40.673 --> 15:43.010
- Uh, we change sheets!

15:43.043 --> 15:44.978
- Well great, so then,
you've got it covered,

15:45.012 --> 15:46.579
let's put a big, fat "J"
next to that one.

15:46.613 --> 15:49.316
- No, no, we're not putting
a "J," we're putting an "R!"

15:49.349 --> 15:51.985
Or better yet, Roland,
why not just get to work?

15:52.019 --> 15:53.686
- This isn't exactly
what I had in mind

15:53.720 --> 15:56.056
when I said I needed help.
- Yeah, I know.

15:56.089 --> 15:59.592
- No, guys, look, I just
need to find something

15:59.626 --> 16:01.361
that caters to my expertise.

16:01.394 --> 16:03.063
That's all, you know
what I can do?

16:03.096 --> 16:04.764
I can restock the soda machine.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.067
- Yeah, the soda machines
are fine, Roland.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.402
What would actually help is if
you could clean a toilet or two,

16:09.436 --> 16:11.504
but obviously,
you're too good for that.

16:11.538 --> 16:14.241
- No, I can clean a toilet.
- You know what,

16:14.274 --> 16:16.176
I think we made a mistake,
Stevie.
- Mhmm.

16:16.209 --> 16:18.211
- No! I wanna clean a toilet.
- We'll hire somebody else.

16:18.245 --> 16:20.313
- No, I need to clean a toilet!

16:21.514 --> 16:23.683
- You need to clean a toilet?

16:23.716 --> 16:25.518
- (Sighs) Yeah,
I need to Johnny,

16:25.552 --> 16:28.021
I... I mean, with the new
baby coming,

16:28.055 --> 16:30.223
things are a little tight.

16:30.257 --> 16:32.159
Joc and I have been
trying to save,

16:32.192 --> 16:34.694
but we've been living off
cold cuts and waffles.

16:34.727 --> 16:37.330
And Jocelyn had to sell her
Beanie Baby collection.

16:37.364 --> 16:40.033
And she didn't get half what
that Diana bear is worth.

16:40.067 --> 16:42.502
And now she's working nights
down at the gas station.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.671
- She's working nights?
- No, she's not,

16:44.704 --> 16:48.075
but she will have to
if things get really bad.

16:50.277 --> 16:52.312
(Whimpers)

16:52.345 --> 16:55.248
- (Sighs heavily) All right.

16:55.282 --> 16:56.649
Here's what we're gonna do.
- Hmm?

16:56.683 --> 16:58.285
- We're putting an "R" beside

16:58.318 --> 17:00.087
every single thing on this list.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.722
- (Smacks lips) Got it. Okay.
Now when you say "R,"

17:02.755 --> 17:05.125
does that stand for Rose,
as in Johnny Rose--

17:05.158 --> 17:07.260
- Roland! It stands for Roland!
- Okay.

17:07.294 --> 17:09.296
- And you can start by taking
those sheets over to room two.

17:09.329 --> 17:10.563
- You got it.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.234
(Birds chirp)

17:15.868 --> 17:18.037
(Keys jingle)

17:20.740 --> 17:22.275
(Door shuts, lights click on)

17:22.309 --> 17:24.511
- Ew! What are you doing
in my bed?

17:24.544 --> 17:26.513
- Oh David please,
I couldn't possibly make it

17:26.546 --> 17:28.415
all the way to my own bed.

17:28.448 --> 17:29.749
I'm-I'm just uh...

17:31.318 --> 17:33.220
I'm exhausted!
- (Sighs)

17:35.255 --> 17:37.724
Was it the footwork?
- Oh, it was the footwork.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.859
It was the score,
it was the book,

17:39.892 --> 17:42.229
it was all of that, David.

17:42.262 --> 17:45.064
But most severely lacking...
was me.

17:46.466 --> 17:48.735
You were right, my dear.

17:48.768 --> 17:52.539
I've had my time,
and it's over now.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.874
- Um, I don't think
I said that.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.344
- There is an elephant
in the room David,

17:57.377 --> 18:00.247
and he's whispering, "retire!"

18:00.280 --> 18:02.582
Run David, go to Jocelyn,

18:02.615 --> 18:04.584
and tell her to cancel
the evening.

18:04.617 --> 18:07.420
- Okay... um well,
I won't be doing that,

18:07.454 --> 18:09.422
but... (sighs)

18:11.391 --> 18:14.161
there is one other option.

18:14.194 --> 18:15.628
- What?

18:16.796 --> 18:19.166
- What if we did...

18:20.433 --> 18:22.269
the number?

18:23.836 --> 18:25.805
- The number?
- Yeah, I know,

18:25.838 --> 18:28.275
it was stupid, it was dumb.
It was a dumb idea.

18:29.809 --> 18:32.479
- David, you would do
that for me?

18:34.614 --> 18:37.150
I thought you used to hate it
when I'd trot you out

18:37.184 --> 18:38.818
in front of my friends?

18:38.851 --> 18:43.623
- I still do, it's just that
I'm finding this situation

18:43.656 --> 18:45.592
to be incredibly disturbing,

18:45.625 --> 18:49.396
and I will eventually need
my bed back.

18:49.429 --> 18:52.599
- Do you think people would
find it strange,

18:52.632 --> 18:55.302
or even inappropriate?
- Probably.

18:56.536 --> 18:59.639
- And do you think
we still have it?

19:01.208 --> 19:03.343
- I'll go plug in my hair
straightener.

19:03.376 --> 19:05.645
I hope you're not wearing
your shoes.

19:11.451 --> 19:12.919
(Audience applauds)

19:14.554 --> 19:15.922
- Okay, let's have another
round of applause

19:15.955 --> 19:17.424
for the children's choir,

19:17.457 --> 19:19.526
and their Kylie Minogue medley!

19:19.559 --> 19:20.760
(Audience applauds)

19:20.793 --> 19:23.196
- Those were some racy lyrics!

19:23.230 --> 19:25.298
Okay. Ladies and gentlemen,

19:25.332 --> 19:28.201
I know that your headliner
tonight is gonna surprise you,

19:28.235 --> 19:30.270
because she certainly
surprised me

19:30.303 --> 19:32.272
when she told me
just moments ago

19:32.305 --> 19:33.906
that she'd switched up
her entire act,

19:33.940 --> 19:35.742
even though somebody put down
a really hefty deposit

19:35.775 --> 19:37.644
on a wall of mirrors!

19:37.677 --> 19:40.280
(Chuckle turns into a sob)

19:40.313 --> 19:43.550
Okay anyways, without
further ado, the main event!

19:44.784 --> 19:47.186
(Audience applauds)

19:49.622 --> 19:51.258
(Mic feedback squeal)

19:51.291 --> 19:53.693
- Oh, thank you so much.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.862
- Um, is this the number?

19:55.895 --> 19:58.898
It's the middle of summer.

19:58.931 --> 20:02.469
- Brr! It's awfully
cold out there.

20:02.502 --> 20:04.237
- Um, they used to do this act

20:04.271 --> 20:05.838
every year at our Christmas
party,

20:05.872 --> 20:07.807
and you can't unsee something
like this.

20:07.840 --> 20:08.908
- (Laughs)

20:08.941 --> 20:10.743
- Ahem!
(Knocking)

20:10.777 --> 20:14.013
Oh, I wonder
who that could be!

20:14.046 --> 20:16.383
It's television's Moira Rose!

20:16.416 --> 20:17.850
(Audience applauds)

20:17.884 --> 20:19.786
- That's television's mom,
to you.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.521
- (Fake laugh)

20:21.554 --> 20:24.524
- You know, nothing is colder
than the chill I get

20:24.557 --> 20:27.560
when I think of the dangers
of asbestos poisoning.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.362
- Mhmm.

20:29.396 --> 20:31.664
- Luckily,
a little birdie told me

20:31.698 --> 20:33.800
that with enough funds raised,

20:33.833 --> 20:37.437
this town could be asbestos
free by...

20:37.470 --> 20:40.573
(Mic feedback squeal)
- Christmas!

20:40.607 --> 20:43.376

on the piano)

20:45.912 --> 20:47.480
- ♪ Ding!
- ♪ Dong!

20:47.514 --> 20:48.715

20:48.748 --> 20:50.350
- ♪ Ding!

21:03.863 --> 21:07.567

21:07.600 --> 21:09.336
(Forced laugh,
Johnny and Patrick laugh)

21:09.369 --> 21:10.570
(Jazz music plays)
