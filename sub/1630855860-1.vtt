21:19.946 --> 21:21.864
Hold on. Shit…

21:23.616 --> 21:25.535
These sticks are such
a pain in the ass to adjust.

21:26.327 --> 21:28.621
I wish the network
would get us better equipment.

21:29.373 --> 21:31.624
Quit your complaining, sweetheart!

21:32.000 --> 21:35.461
You know why you’ve looked amazing
for the past 15 years?

21:35.753 --> 21:37.922
Because I’m the one
holding the camera’s ass.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.258
So let me do my thing.

21:42.093 --> 21:43.136
It's all me.

21:44.679 --> 21:46.473
Oh, yeah right!

21:46.473 --> 21:48.517
The camera loves me, Luisito.

21:48.517 --> 21:49.809
It's got nothing to do with you.

21:50.351 --> 21:52.311
At least you’re not holding this…

21:53.439 --> 21:55.273
…disgusting microphone.

21:56.442 --> 21:59.110
What's Andrea doing with it
during the evening shift?

21:59.110 --> 22:00.111
Seriously.

22:00.111 --> 22:00.820
I mean…

22:04.073 --> 22:05.241
At least it’s all dried up…

22:06.367 --> 22:07.535
Want some of this?

22:07.535 --> 22:08.703
No, I’ll pass.

22:11.247 --> 22:12.040
Gabi?

22:12.665 --> 22:13.708
Gabrielita?

22:14.542 --> 22:16.461
How are we doing on the other side?

22:17.378 --> 22:18.713
Ready for your debut?

22:18.963 --> 22:21.424
Or did you shit in your new suit?

22:22.426 --> 22:24.761
Thanks for the good luck wishes, Lucia.

22:26.929 --> 22:30.058
Gentlemen! Please…

22:30.058 --> 22:31.477
Thank you.

22:31.477 --> 22:32.727
Shut the fuck up!

22:32.727 --> 22:36.440
A wise old hag once advised me:

22:36.440 --> 22:39.192
Smile like a queen on camera,

22:39.192 --> 22:41.570
but with the confidence of a bitch.

22:42.111 --> 22:43.613
Something I will always remember, Lucia.

22:43.613 --> 22:44.447
Thank you.

22:45.907 --> 22:47.742
GENTLEMEN, PLEASE SHUT UP!

22:48.034 --> 22:50.870
- Quit the flirting!
- Thank you, Ara. Thank you!

22:51.579 --> 22:54.540
- I’m ready for fuck’s sake!
- We’re going live.

22:56.584 --> 22:58.420
You are watching…

23:00.630 --> 23:03.509
The news that keeps you up to speed,

23:03.509 --> 23:05.093
with Lucia De Leon.

23:06.094 --> 23:07.178
Good morning!

23:07.178 --> 23:10.557
And welcome back to AHORITA TV.

23:10.557 --> 23:13.851
Our country’s best morning news program.

23:14.561 --> 23:18.022
It is 7:15 AM, September 19th.

23:18.607 --> 23:26.989
Live on location, inside one of the busiest
building complexes in all of Mexico.

23:26.989 --> 23:31.869
Let’s take a look
at the exterior of the building,

23:31.869 --> 23:34.456
which is only a few blocks
away from our studio.

23:34.664 --> 23:36.290
Thank you so much, Lucia!

23:36.290 --> 23:37.917
It’s a pleasure to introduce myself.

23:37.917 --> 23:38.627
I am--

23:38.960 --> 23:39.836
Mother Fuck!

23:39.836 --> 23:41.420
I am Gabriela Maldonado,

23:41.420 --> 23:43.798
live from Coyoacán.

23:44.507 --> 23:48.886
Though we are booming
with new infrastructures,

23:48.886 --> 23:52.515
we’re proud to preserve
so many classical buildings.

23:52.515 --> 23:55.602
A lot of the older buildings

23:55.602 --> 23:59.147
have been standing
since the early 1900s.

23:59.564 --> 24:01.023
That’s right.

24:01.023 --> 24:03.901
Catch Gabriela on the tour today at noon.

24:04.528 --> 24:07.697
We’re very excited
because next month

24:07.697 --> 24:09.532
this building will have a series of […]

24:09.532 --> 24:11.075
that I’d like to announce--

24:17.541 --> 24:18.500
Oh my goodness…

24:20.251 --> 24:21.085
It’s shaking.

24:21.711 --> 24:23.672
Lightly, but it’s shaking.

24:23.672 --> 24:25.923
Lucia, better come here. It’s safer--

24:25.923 --> 24:27.509
I’ll be OK, just wait--

24:29.343 --> 24:32.597
Please stay calm. It’s still shaking.

24:32.597 --> 24:33.472
Everything will be OK.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.141
It’s getting worse, Lucia!

24:52.534 --> 24:53.702
Anybody?

24:54.535 --> 24:56.579
Say something, please!

25:32.573 --> 25:35.744
Shit! I can’t reach it.

25:35.744 --> 25:37.203
Fucking camera!

25:44.586 --> 25:47.088
I’M RIGHT HERE!

25:47.088 --> 25:48.756
I’M ALIVE!

25:49.548 --> 25:50.925
DON’T MOVE!

25:58.140 --> 25:59.768
Everything is falling.

25:59.768 --> 26:00.935
Be careful.

26:01.519 --> 26:02.604
Make space.

26:02.604 --> 26:03.771
Calm down, sir.

26:03.771 --> 26:05.607
We’re getting you out.

26:05.607 --> 26:06.816
- Breathe.
- Boss!

26:07.149 --> 26:08.777
I got a Code 51 over here.

26:08.777 --> 26:09.944
Yes, give me a sec.

26:12.739 --> 26:13.699
Shit.

26:13.698 --> 26:15.616
We’re going to flip you around, OK?

26:16.701 --> 26:17.785
Karla.

26:17.785 --> 26:19.578
Eddie, come here.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.205
Help me with this piece of ceiling.

26:22.039 --> 26:22.790
Miguel…

26:22.790 --> 26:24.834
Help me with the bar
to brace the weight.

26:24.834 --> 26:26.836
- Fuck! I stepped on something.
- You OK?

26:26.836 --> 26:27.962
Yeah, all good.

26:28.629 --> 26:30.131
On three, OK?

26:30.464 --> 26:31.882
One, two, three!

26:34.802 --> 26:36.304
Now pull him forward.

26:37.054 --> 26:38.556
One, two, three!

26:39.765 --> 26:40.599
One more time.

26:40.599 --> 26:41.934
One, two, three!

26:42.977 --> 26:44.520
- I got him, I got him!
- You got him?

26:44.520 --> 26:45.604
- Are you bracing his neck, Eddie?
- Yes.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.732
Get him sitting on
one, two, three!

26:53.446 --> 26:55.616
What is your name? Look at me.

26:56.742 --> 26:57.325
Luis.

26:57.325 --> 26:58.242
Hi Luis.

26:58.242 --> 26:59.618
I’m Karla, and I'm going
to check you out.

27:01.704 --> 27:02.872
Look at me.

27:03.622 --> 27:04.707
How many people are on this floor?

27:04.707 --> 27:05.916
I don’t know.

27:05.916 --> 27:07.711
There were five of us.

27:08.002 --> 27:08.627
Lucia…

27:09.754 --> 27:10.631
myself…

27:11.213 --> 27:12.506
We have to get him out of here.

27:14.550 --> 27:15.926
It’s collapsing. Eddie?

27:16.927 --> 27:17.845
Find anyone else?

27:17.845 --> 27:18.721
Nobody, sir.

27:19.221 --> 27:21.098
The remaining floors above
are completely leveled

27:21.098 --> 27:22.643
and we don't have
the right equipment.

27:22.643 --> 27:23.768
We need to get outside.

27:28.064 --> 27:29.190
Let’s go! On three!

27:29.190 --> 27:30.524
One, two, three!

27:32.068 --> 27:34.278
Let’s get out of here!
It’s collapsing!

27:34.278 --> 27:34.945
LET’S GO!

27:35.988 --> 27:38.616
- QUICK! IT'S COLLAPSING!
- You were right, Lucia.

27:38.616 --> 27:39.785
The camera loves you.

27:39.785 --> 27:40.701
Drop the fucking camera!

27:40.701 --> 27:42.703
My whole life’s been dedicated
to filming behind the camera.

27:42.703 --> 27:44.372
This is my story of real heroes!

27:47.625 --> 27:48.834
What are you doing?! GO!

27:48.834 --> 27:49.752
I’m trying!

27:50.544 --> 27:53.881
Faster! Faster! Don't think, just run!

27:54.590 --> 27:55.633
There’s a door right here!

27:56.592 --> 27:57.551
One, two…

28:02.139 --> 28:03.516
What’s happening?!

28:06.102 --> 28:07.186
You doing OK?

28:07.186 --> 28:08.896
This is going to fall on us!

28:08.896 --> 28:11.900
No, it won’t.
I promise to get you out of here.

28:11.900 --> 28:13.735
Boss, let’s go! Let’s go!

28:13.776 --> 28:14.485
I’m coming!

28:17.238 --> 28:17.988
We need to keep moving!

28:21.158 --> 28:22.243
It’s gonna collapse!

28:24.161 --> 28:25.914
- Faster!
- Run!

28:25.914 --> 28:27.957
Dude! Take care of the old man!

28:27.957 --> 28:31.127
Let’s fucking move!

28:31.127 --> 28:32.378
It’s over here.

28:33.003 --> 28:35.131
There’s stairs. Watch your step!

28:36.215 --> 28:37.800
Wait, wait, wait!

28:40.553 --> 28:41.847
Shit, watch the walls!

28:43.722 --> 28:46.016
Watch the roof! The roof!

28:46.016 --> 28:48.519
Eddie, we don’t have all fucking day!

28:48.519 --> 28:50.104
Stop busting my balls, Miguel!

28:50.104 --> 28:52.106
Luis, move or I’ll kill you myself!

28:52.106 --> 28:53.858
- Let’s go! Run!
- I’m coming!

28:53.858 --> 28:55.818
There’s a clear hallway!

28:56.402 --> 28:57.695
Shit, the exit’s blocked!

28:57.695 --> 28:59.280
- OK, move!
- We have to keep going!

29:00.406 --> 29:02.283
- Be careful!
- Run, run, run!

29:02.283 --> 29:04.952
Watch out for loose cables!
Come on!

29:04.952 --> 29:06.996
Fucking Argentinian,
nobody understands your Spanish!

29:06.996 --> 29:08.289
Your sister never complained!

29:08.289 --> 29:09.540
There’s one over here!

29:09.540 --> 29:11.292
Miguel, I need the bar!
Come on!

29:11.709 --> 29:13.210
- Let’s go!
- Run!

29:13.210 --> 29:14.170
There’s no fire…

29:14.170 --> 29:16.422
- Everybody OK?
- Yes.

29:17.465 --> 29:18.507
Stay right there.

29:18.507 --> 29:20.802
Break it like a man, Miguel!

29:20.802 --> 29:22.136
Door opens, you follow!

29:23.179 --> 29:23.929
Break it!

29:26.849 --> 29:27.766
Let’s go!

29:31.228 --> 29:33.731
Shit, we are getting too low.

29:33.731 --> 29:35.524
We have to keep going.

29:37.903 --> 29:40.738
We can’t keep going lower.

29:41.530 --> 29:42.281
What’s wrong?

29:42.281 --> 29:43.657
THE DOOR IS JAMMED!

29:45.159 --> 29:46.160
Here comes another tremor.

29:47.996 --> 29:51.207
Luis, move! Move!

29:57.923 --> 29:59.673
Don’t let me suffer, Karla!

29:59.673 --> 30:01.175
Luis, don’t film this!

30:01.175 --> 30:02.885
Javier, we’re getting you out of this!

30:03.928 --> 30:04.971
Grab the bar…

30:05.179 --> 30:06.347
Grab it!

30:06.347 --> 30:08.599
Don’t fucking do this!
We are getting you out!

30:08.599 --> 30:09.976
We have no time.

30:12.520 --> 30:15.105
Boss, look at me.
You’re not dying like this.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.316
I need you to focus.

30:17.816 --> 30:20.069
How many fucking floors
or exits are in this building?

30:20.069 --> 30:20.945
I don’t know!

30:20.945 --> 30:23.614
There’s many… and a basement!

30:23.614 --> 30:25.991
You need to get out of here.

30:25.991 --> 30:30.038
- Karla. It’s not an order, I’m begging you!
- Don’t make me do this to you.

30:30.956 --> 30:32.706
Focus!

30:32.706 --> 30:34.500
- Say it.
- No.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.252
- “First me.”
- No. No.

30:36.252 --> 30:37.795
Say it! “FIRST ME!”

30:38.796 --> 30:39.588
“First me!”

30:40.048 --> 30:40.839
First me.

30:40.839 --> 30:41.842
Then what?

30:42.299 --> 30:43.717
Then me.

30:43.717 --> 30:44.970
Then after?

30:44.970 --> 30:45.844
At the end?

30:47.013 --> 30:47.846
The end?!

30:47.846 --> 30:49.515
Take it, Karla. End his pain.

30:49.515 --> 30:50.851
We have to go!

30:52.476 --> 30:53.394
Don’t think!

30:55.646 --> 30:56.522
Do it, Karla!

30:57.106 --> 31:01.694
- What comes at the end? Say it…
- And finally…

31:02.486 --> 31:03.320
NOW, KARLA!

31:03.320 --> 31:04.113
KARLA, DON’T!

31:04.113 --> 31:04.990
…ME!

31:16.084 --> 31:17.543
There’s an air duct over here!

31:25.551 --> 31:26.385
Hurry, let's go!

31:28.554 --> 31:29.597
Eddie, let’s go!

31:29.888 --> 31:30.973
I’m sorry, boss.

31:31.599 --> 31:32.516
Luis!

31:32.516 --> 31:34.310
Can’t you see what happened?! GO!

31:34.310 --> 31:35.936
She killed him. She killed him!

31:44.695 --> 31:46.155
We’re right behind you, Karla.

31:49.617 --> 31:51.327
I can’t see shit with this headlamp!

31:51.327 --> 31:53.412
- Crack the emergency glow sticks.
- Yes, the glow sticks!

31:56.373 --> 31:57.916
Take it.

31:59.085 --> 32:00.962
I have a light. Here you go.

32:15.060 --> 32:18.395
Karla, listen to me, please.

32:20.105 --> 32:21.649
We’re gonna be OK.

32:22.358 --> 32:26.154
But we have to keep going.

32:27.655 --> 32:30.992
We can’t stay.
I promise we’ll get out.

32:31.408 --> 32:33.827
But I need you to be strong.

32:35.162 --> 32:36.288
Please...

32:36.998 --> 32:38.040
keep going.

32:39.375 --> 32:40.584
Do it for Javier.

32:45.172 --> 32:46.382
For Javier.

32:49.468 --> 32:51.387
I can’t breathe.

32:52.513 --> 32:53.847
Let’s go, Luis.

32:53.847 --> 32:57.434
I’m telling you I can’t. I need air!

33:00.646 --> 33:03.315
Karla… Karla, right?

33:05.025 --> 33:08.821
Please hold onto the camera a second.

33:08.821 --> 33:09.822
I need my hands--

33:09.822 --> 33:11.949
Motherfucker! Just drop
that fucking camera already!

33:11.949 --> 33:14.660
I can’t with my hands anymore.

33:15.828 --> 33:17.122
Please…

33:17.122 --> 33:20.874
Just a moment. Hold it here.

33:27.881 --> 33:29.925
Thank you.

33:34.097 --> 33:36.557
Luis, take this.

33:39.601 --> 33:41.187
Come on. Go ahead.

33:49.069 --> 33:50.571
Are you fucking with me, Luis?

33:52.823 --> 33:55.200
If you fart again,
I swear to god I’ll kill you.

34:08.172 --> 34:10.175
Come on. Let’s move it, asshole.

34:12.301 --> 34:13.342
Watch out! There’s a drop!

34:16.221 --> 34:17.222
You all right?

34:18.431 --> 34:19.225
Yes.

34:21.851 --> 34:24.103
Hold on. Give me a sec.

34:32.446 --> 34:34.114
Luis, you good?

34:34.114 --> 34:35.364
Yes, I think so.

34:39.120 --> 34:40.036
Take your camera.

34:40.036 --> 34:40.661
What?

34:40.661 --> 34:42.248
Your camera! I can’t hold it anymore.

34:45.667 --> 34:48.003
- Do you hear that?
- I hear something.

34:48.003 --> 34:49.213
It sounds like voices.

34:57.471 --> 34:58.263
I hear somebody.

34:59.097 --> 35:00.808
We gotta go.

35:02.351 --> 35:05.771
- Let’s go check.
- We hear you. We’re coming!

35:13.362 --> 35:14.738
- Come on, Luis.
- No.

35:15.739 --> 35:16.698
Why not?

35:16.698 --> 35:18.742
Didn’t you hear that?

35:18.742 --> 35:20.661
You plan to stay here alone, or what?

35:20.661 --> 35:21.495
Let’s go!

35:23.331 --> 35:24.207
Watch your head.

35:29.920 --> 35:32.714
Don’t touch anything.
It could collapse any moment.

35:32.714 --> 35:34.049
No shit! You’re telling me!

35:34.049 --> 35:35.176
Don’t touch anything!

35:52.860 --> 35:53.652
What is this?

36:00.784 --> 36:02.119
What is this place?

36:04.288 --> 36:06.039
Those are pre-Hispanic paintings.

36:07.833 --> 36:08.876
You see this?

36:13.589 --> 36:14.673
Turn on your light!

36:14.673 --> 36:16.259
My battery cut out. One sec…

36:17.343 --> 36:18.135
I think I got it.

36:25.809 --> 36:27.228
It can’t be…

36:36.153 --> 36:37.613
Don’t touch anything!

36:38.323 --> 36:39.031
Guys…

36:40.073 --> 36:41.909
You see all the skulls?

36:57.090 --> 36:57.799
Eddie!

36:58.383 --> 36:59.676
Get out of the way.

36:59.676 --> 37:01.261
- Eddie.
- Get away from there, Eddie!

37:02.137 --> 37:04.765
That’s the wall of Mictlān.

37:05.515 --> 37:07.601
What? The wall of what?

37:09.895 --> 37:11.439
- Eddie.
- What’s happening?

37:13.148 --> 37:14.234
- What’s going on?
- Eddie?

37:14.399 --> 37:16.360
Stop it, asshole! You’re scaring us.

37:18.153 --> 37:19.488
This is Mictlān.

37:19.488 --> 37:20.948
What the fuck are you saying?!

37:21.698 --> 37:24.076
Our God has risen from the underworld.

37:24.076 --> 37:25.245
Put the bar down.

37:25.619 --> 37:27.288
- Our king…
- Put the bar down!

37:27.288 --> 37:29.331
will be compensated.

37:29.331 --> 37:33.418
- Our God will feed and collect.
- Eddie, what’s happening to you?

37:33.418 --> 37:34.419
Put the bar down!

37:35.338 --> 37:36.463
EDDIE, NO!

37:41.385 --> 37:43.261
What the fuck are you doing?!

37:46.723 --> 37:52.272
The heart is my blood,
my gift, my welcome!

37:52.272 --> 37:53.439
Karla, grab him!

37:59.111 --> 38:01.363
Wall of Tzompantli.

38:01.363 --> 38:03.657
Victims of war.

38:03.657 --> 38:06.994
Display of savage victory.

38:15.919 --> 38:16.503
What the fuck is that?

38:18.755 --> 38:22.801
Step back into our lands of…

38:22.801 --> 38:24.886
TENOCHTITLAN!

38:32.185 --> 38:33.437
Karla! Grab the bar!

38:33.437 --> 38:35.564
GRAB THE FUCKING BAR
FOR FUCK’S SAKE!

38:36.023 --> 38:36.940
Oh shit! Run!

38:37.733 --> 38:39.444
Wait for me!
Where are you going?!

38:39.444 --> 38:41.445
No! Don’t leave me here!

38:43.448 --> 38:45.115
Grab my hand!

38:45.115 --> 38:46.283
Pull me harder!

38:46.867 --> 38:47.909
I can’t!

39:08.138 --> 39:09.097
My head.

39:12.809 --> 39:14.728
What’s that sound?

39:25.280 --> 39:25.947
My light…

39:26.990 --> 39:27.616
My light!

39:32.704 --> 39:33.580
Where is everybody?

39:40.462 --> 39:41.922
Karla, where are you?

39:43.298 --> 39:44.800
Where are the bodies?

39:49.096 --> 39:50.764
Those big fucking hands.

40:21.629 --> 40:22.879
Our Lord.

40:23.964 --> 40:25.633
All powerful.

40:32.305 --> 40:34.141
God of many names.

40:44.943 --> 40:46.446
Mictlān.

40:49.739 --> 40:52.117
Ixpuztec.

40:57.497 --> 40:59.541
Nextepehua.

41:01.668 --> 41:03.753
Tzontemoc.

41:06.006 --> 41:07.841
Mictlantecuhtli.

41:10.594 --> 41:12.971
Bless us with your presence.

41:14.347 --> 41:17.350
Bathe us with your strength.

41:23.481 --> 41:25.485
Mictlān.

41:25.485 --> 41:26.611
Rise up.

41:30.155 --> 41:31.948
Mictlantecuhtli.

41:35.619 --> 41:36.578
Rise.

41:37.787 --> 41:39.039
Rise.

41:39.664 --> 41:41.708
Rise!

41:42.667 --> 41:44.544
RISE!

41:57.140 --> 42:01.895
We are living in one of the most
terrifying situations of our country.

42:03.271 --> 42:06.733
We haven’t seen anything like this
since the quake of ‘57.

42:10.237 --> 42:15.784
Today, September 19th,
approximately 7:20 AM…

42:17.494 --> 42:19.204
…will be a day to remember.

42:20.413 --> 42:22.165
…will be a day to remember.
