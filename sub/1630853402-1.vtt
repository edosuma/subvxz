02:38.620 --> 02:40.896
- Woo!

02:40.896 --> 02:43.965
- Say thank you daddy
for our new house!

02:43.965 --> 02:46.275
- You're welcome
Bri, my baby cakes.

02:46.275 --> 02:48.448
Hopefully mommy helps daddy
with some work around here.

02:48.448 --> 02:49.241
What do you think, mommy?

02:49.241 --> 02:50.724
Is that gonna happen?

02:50.724 --> 02:53.310
- No, but I still
love you though.

02:53.310 --> 02:54.793
- Hey guys, can you stay
on this side please?

02:54.793 --> 02:56.379
Thanks guys.

02:57.896 --> 02:59.689
Hold this for me, hold this.

03:02.137 --> 03:03.379
Smooth!

03:05.103 --> 03:06.275
- All right babe, I'm
gonna take her in.

03:06.275 --> 03:07.068
It's getting chilly out.

03:07.068 --> 03:07.689
- Okay baby, I'll see you later.

03:07.827 --> 03:08.275
- Okay.

03:10.310 --> 03:11.413
Bye baby!

03:18.344 --> 03:19.620
My first house.

04:30.379 --> 04:32.344
- Babe, you think you're
gonna be done soon?

04:32.344 --> 04:33.689
You know everyone's
gonna be here in an hour.

04:33.689 --> 04:35.344
And look at you.

04:35.344 --> 04:36.379
All sweaty.

04:36.379 --> 04:38.551
I mean fine, but sweaty.

04:38.551 --> 04:39.689
I need you to help me come
in here and set up, babe!

04:39.689 --> 04:42.103
- Okay okay, I'm done.

04:42.103 --> 04:42.827
Get out here before
I squirt you, girl!

04:42.827 --> 04:44.034
- You better not!

04:44.034 --> 04:45.896
You know better than that.

04:45.896 --> 04:46.586
- I'm not changing neither.

04:46.586 --> 04:48.206
I look good in dirt.

04:48.206 --> 04:49.793
Don't you think?

04:49.793 --> 04:50.862
- You better not bring
all those dirty clothes

04:50.862 --> 04:53.068
into my newly freshly
cleaned house.

04:53.068 --> 04:54.689
- Oh your house huh?

04:55.517 --> 04:57.482
Okay.

04:57.482 --> 04:58.655
- Hurry up!

05:21.482 --> 05:22.448
- Gosh, I love what
you did with the place.

05:22.448 --> 05:23.344
It looks great.

05:23.344 --> 05:24.758
- I don't know.

05:24.758 --> 05:25.620
I'm still trying
to get settled in.

05:25.620 --> 05:28.068
I'm not feeling it yet.

05:28.068 --> 05:29.586
- Girl, listen, you
know you can call me.

05:29.586 --> 05:30.551
Contact me anytime.

05:30.551 --> 05:31.413
- I will.

05:31.413 --> 05:32.896
You know I will.

05:32.896 --> 05:33.827
I'll be calling you
in about an hour.

05:34.758 --> 05:35.758
- I love you so much.

05:35.758 --> 05:37.551
- I love you too.

05:37.896 --> 05:38.793
- Don't forget, call me.

05:38.793 --> 05:39.206
- I will.

05:52.344 --> 05:54.137
- Let's go, Bri!

05:54.137 --> 05:56.413
It's my baby's birthday today!

05:57.068 --> 05:58.103
She's three!

06:01.000 --> 06:02.275
- Oooh!

06:03.172 --> 06:04.034
That's pretty!

06:05.310 --> 06:07.172
Say thank you, Liz.

06:07.172 --> 06:08.896
- You're welcome.

06:08.896 --> 06:10.034
- My little diva.

06:10.034 --> 06:11.344
- I wanna see that one.

06:11.344 --> 06:12.517
- Come here, Bri.

06:12.517 --> 06:13.310
Come here, you can do it.

06:13.310 --> 06:14.517
Come here.

06:14.517 --> 06:16.068
- Girl, she does not wanna walk.

06:16.068 --> 06:17.517
All she wants to do is crawl.

06:17.517 --> 06:19.344
Trust me, we've been trying.

06:19.344 --> 06:21.344
We get the call from
the doctor tomorrow.

06:21.344 --> 06:22.206
I'm scared.

06:22.827 --> 06:23.827
- Damn baby, you
acting like she's

06:23.827 --> 06:24.862
going in for surgery
or something.

06:24.862 --> 06:26.689
-I know Kathy

06:26.689 --> 06:28.655
If killing a vibe was a person.

06:28.655 --> 06:29.827
- Oh really?

06:29.827 --> 06:30.517
Gonna do me like that?

06:32.172 --> 06:33.551
- It's okay, my baby walk
soon enough, right Bri?

06:36.827 --> 06:37.310
- Another one?

06:37.310 --> 06:39.137
- Yeah.

06:39.137 --> 06:40.655
- You did not have to do that.

06:40.655 --> 06:40.896
Thank you.

06:43.172 --> 06:45.068
- What's in here?

06:45.068 --> 06:47.000
- A teddy bear.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.034
- Not a teddy bear.

06:48.034 --> 06:48.344
It's a nanny cam.

06:49.827 --> 06:51.482
- A nanny cam, okay.

06:51.482 --> 06:53.172
- Yes, you can stalk her
on your phone all day long.

06:53.172 --> 06:54.482
- Okay.

06:54.482 --> 06:57.172
- And it is a camera.

06:57.172 --> 06:59.344
For the bedroom!

06:59.344 --> 07:00.344
- You would.

07:02.137 --> 07:03.344
- Don't we all wish.

07:03.344 --> 07:04.896
- Shut up.

07:20.103 --> 07:21.931
- I can't believe our baby
just turned three today.

07:24.896 --> 07:26.862
And we're all comfortable
in our new home.

07:29.551 --> 07:30.275
- I'm just so happy I'm done.

07:32.137 --> 07:35.310
All the paperwork, the
moving, the fixing.

07:35.310 --> 07:36.896
Has me exhausted.

07:36.896 --> 07:37.379
- I bet.

07:39.448 --> 07:41.413
I mean we lucked up though.

07:41.413 --> 07:42.758
Being able to buy this house

07:42.758 --> 07:44.103
so cheap from your grandfather.

07:45.620 --> 07:46.896
- It was either us or the bank.

07:46.896 --> 07:48.931
At least it gets to
stay in the family.

07:48.931 --> 07:50.275
And we get to pass
it on to our kids.

07:53.241 --> 07:53.793
- Kids?

07:57.586 --> 07:58.551
Babe, I'm not having
anymore kids.

08:00.206 --> 08:01.275
At least not for a while.

08:02.344 --> 08:03.965
Bri is more than enough.

08:08.931 --> 08:10.103
- Whatever.

08:10.103 --> 08:11.620
Goodnight.

08:11.620 --> 08:13.689
- "Whatever goodnight"?

08:13.689 --> 08:15.827
Okay, that's what we're doing?

08:15.862 --> 08:16.344
Okay.

08:18.137 --> 08:19.517
Goodnight baby.

08:44.931 --> 08:46.655
Home sweet home.

08:46.655 --> 08:48.310
What a day what a day.

08:48.689 --> 08:49.965
All right baby, you're
gonna sit here and play

08:49.965 --> 08:51.620
with your new toys while
mommy cooks dinner.

08:51.758 --> 08:52.413
- Yeah.

08:52.413 --> 08:53.034
- Okay.

08:53.137 --> 08:54.137
- Here you go, baby.

08:54.137 --> 08:55.275
You want this?

08:55.275 --> 08:56.793
- Here's her brush.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.068
Here's her brush.

08:59.758 --> 09:01.275
Tell me what you want.

09:01.275 --> 09:02.413
Why you looking at me like that?

09:02.413 --> 09:03.551
- I want you, girl.

09:08.413 --> 09:08.862
- Leonard.

09:11.413 --> 09:12.413
- Sorry, I was thirsty.

09:13.517 --> 09:14.000
- The door.

09:14.241 --> 09:15.137
Why'd you leave the door open?

09:15.965 --> 09:16.655
- I didn't leave that door open.

09:16.655 --> 09:18.206
You probably did.

09:18.206 --> 09:19.344
- Oh I did?

09:20.034 --> 09:22.344
You definitely left
the door open.

09:22.379 --> 09:24.068
- Babe, I really didn't
leave this door open.

09:24.551 --> 09:25.482
- So you got amnesia again?

09:28.344 --> 09:30.172
Are you gonna stare at it
or are you gonna close it?

09:42.172 --> 09:44.862
And you brought dirt
into my kitchen?

09:44.862 --> 09:46.586
- Babe, what are
you talking about?

09:46.586 --> 09:48.862
- Clean it up and go
feed the dogs please.

09:48.862 --> 09:50.172
- Anything else?

09:50.172 --> 09:50.862
- Yeah,
I'll let you know.

10:03.206 --> 10:04.172
- All right,
so who do we have next?

10:04.172 --> 10:06.068
- We have little miss Brianna.

10:06.068 --> 10:08.275
Therapist said she's done well.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.551
No signs of autism or
any physical defects.

10:11.724 --> 10:13.172
- Her x-rays look good.

10:13.172 --> 10:15.172
- So do
our MRI reports.

10:15.172 --> 10:16.931
- So what are you thinking?

10:16.931 --> 10:19.241
- Well it's complicated.

10:19.241 --> 10:21.000
My first thought was
Rhett Syndrome.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.689
- What makes you think that?

10:22.689 --> 10:24.689
- Well as you know, with
Rhett Syndrome children

10:24.689 --> 10:27.344
between one and four years
of age lose the ability

10:27.344 --> 10:29.724
to perform skills
they previously had.

10:29.724 --> 10:32.103
The loss can be rapid,
could be more gradual,

10:32.103 --> 10:34.000
occurring over weeks
or even months.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
- That actually seems to fit

10:35.000 --> 10:37.172
Brianna's clinical picture here.

10:37.172 --> 10:39.344
- Yeah, but that's it.

10:39.344 --> 10:41.413
She hasn't experienced any
pain in her lower extremities

10:41.413 --> 10:43.379
and her head growth is normal.

10:43.379 --> 10:45.724
- So what are you thinking?

10:45.724 --> 10:48.931
- My first thought was
Acute Benign Myositis.

10:48.931 --> 10:50.172
- Yeah, but usually
you have leg pain

10:50.172 --> 10:52.103
associated with that as well.

10:52.103 --> 10:54.034
- Yes I know, but the
difference is with

10:54.034 --> 10:56.241
Rhett Syndrome you lose
the ability to walk.

10:56.241 --> 10:58.241
Brianna's x-rays and MRI report

10:58.241 --> 11:00.068
show no structural damage.

11:00.068 --> 11:02.241
- So what do I tell the parents?

11:02.241 --> 11:03.517
I mean I don't wanna
scare them and we're

11:03.517 --> 11:05.275
not really sure what
we're dealing with.

11:05.275 --> 11:07.310
- I would just be truthful.

11:07.310 --> 11:08.793
There's a chance Brianna won't

11:08.793 --> 11:11.758
resume walking for a long time.

11:11.758 --> 11:13.620
They'll need to understand
and accept that.

11:14.620 --> 11:15.896
- All right.

11:15.896 --> 11:17.310
- We'll continue to run tests.

11:32.620 --> 11:34.068
- Kathy!

11:34.068 --> 11:35.965
Dr. Dickerson's on the phone!

11:35.965 --> 11:37.068
- Okay babe, coming!

11:37.068 --> 11:38.068
- Hello?

11:38.068 --> 11:38.931
- Hey Leonard.

11:38.931 --> 11:40.275
How are you guys making out?

11:40.275 --> 11:42.000
- Good good, finally
getting settled in.

11:42.000 --> 11:42.827
- That sounds great.

11:42.827 --> 11:44.689
You guys deserve it.

11:44.689 --> 11:46.758
Well I hope I have some
good news for you.

11:46.758 --> 11:48.413
So I looked at Brianna's tests,

11:48.413 --> 11:50.310
all of her tests
came back negative.

11:50.310 --> 11:53.413
Her MRIs are negative,
her x-rays are good.

11:53.413 --> 11:55.586
She really doesn't show any
sign of developmental problems.

12:00.241 --> 12:01.965
You guys seem kinda down.

12:01.965 --> 12:03.620
- No, no, not down at all.

12:03.620 --> 12:07.068
It's a great thing.

12:07.068 --> 12:09.172
I'm just a little
confused because...

12:11.827 --> 12:15.482
I mean she's still not
walking, so I was just

12:15.482 --> 12:19.344
hoping to maybe get
some type of answer.

12:20.517 --> 12:22.586
- Listen, we just
gotta give it some more time.

12:22.655 --> 12:24.241
We'll continue to
do the therapy,

12:24.241 --> 12:25.793
we'll run some more
tests, and hopefully

12:25.793 --> 12:27.448
we'll have a breakthrough soon.

12:27.448 --> 12:28.620
- Okay.

12:30.965 --> 12:32.827
Time and patience it is then.

12:34.655 --> 12:36.137
- And listen, you
guys have a great evening.

12:36.137 --> 12:36.827
- Thank you.

12:36.827 --> 12:37.965
You too.

12:37.965 --> 12:38.448
- Thank you.

12:39.862 --> 12:40.379
- Baby.

12:42.827 --> 12:44.103
She's okay.

12:46.689 --> 12:47.655
- I'm just...

12:48.689 --> 12:49.689
You know.

12:50.862 --> 12:51.689
- I know.

12:56.137 --> 12:57.344
She's good.

12:57.344 --> 12:58.379
She's gonna be great.

12:58.379 --> 12:58.724
- Yeah.

13:29.724 --> 13:31.275
- Baby, why are
the dogs barking?

13:31.275 --> 13:32.482
- I don't know.

13:32.482 --> 13:34.172
I'll figure it out in a few.

13:38.068 --> 13:40.137
- Baby.

13:40.137 --> 13:41.551
Please can you just go check

13:41.551 --> 13:44.310
my Fufu and your
big ugly ass dog?

13:44.310 --> 13:45.551
- Are you serious?

13:45.551 --> 13:46.379
You gonna stop me in the middle?

13:53.034 --> 13:54.724
Look at this, babe.

13:54.724 --> 13:55.862
And you want me to
go to the porch

13:55.862 --> 13:57.896
to check on two hungry dogs.

13:57.896 --> 13:58.517
- You better tuck it in then.

14:07.862 --> 14:10.241
- What the hell are
you guys barking at?

14:14.448 --> 14:17.206
Come on, y'all want your food?

14:17.206 --> 14:18.310
Got your food, but
you wanna bark.

14:18.310 --> 14:19.241
Keep barking.

14:21.448 --> 14:22.206
All right come on, that
should be good enough.

14:22.206 --> 14:23.344
Come on.

14:23.344 --> 14:24.172
Back in there, come on.

14:24.172 --> 14:25.103
Come on come on.

14:25.103 --> 14:25.758
Come on, boy.

14:25.758 --> 14:27.034
Come on.

14:27.034 --> 14:29.344
Come on, come on.

14:29.344 --> 14:31.206
Now stop barking and eat.

14:31.206 --> 14:31.689
Okay?

15:09.241 --> 15:10.103
- So?

15:10.103 --> 15:11.241
- What?

15:11.896 --> 15:12.586
- What was it?

15:12.586 --> 15:12.931
Duh.

15:15.586 --> 15:17.241
- Oh nothing, I guess
they were just hungry.

15:19.034 --> 15:19.896
- Barking like that?

15:23.034 --> 15:24.586
- I don't know babe,
it was kinda weird.

15:24.586 --> 15:26.068
When I was walking back
up the back door opened.

15:28.448 --> 15:30.137
- Shut up, stupid.

15:31.172 --> 15:33.758
You need to stop
trying to scare me.

15:34.517 --> 15:35.379
- I'm being serious.

15:41.068 --> 15:41.482
- Goodnight.

15:44.103 --> 15:45.103
- Why you holding me so tight?

15:45.103 --> 15:45.896
I thought you weren't scared.

15:48.413 --> 15:49.000
- Goodnight.

16:11.482 --> 16:12.896
- Come to mama.

16:12.896 --> 16:14.068
Come this way.

16:16.896 --> 16:18.551
- We still not gonna
walk today huh?

16:23.137 --> 16:25.137
You can do this, okay?

16:25.137 --> 16:26.241
You can do it.

16:26.241 --> 16:27.344
- Hello women of my life!

16:27.344 --> 16:28.379
- Look who it is!

16:28.379 --> 16:28.896
- Hey!

16:30.620 --> 16:32.586
- It's time for some mommy time.

16:32.586 --> 16:34.586
- Mom, you don't want daddy?

16:34.586 --> 16:36.137
Come on girl, we're
gonna get a whirl!

16:36.137 --> 16:37.896
Look at that!

16:37.896 --> 16:40.896
Oh look, look look,
is this yours?

16:40.896 --> 16:41.482
Is this yours?

16:49.896 --> 16:51.206
- Not today, Ti-ti.

17:05.034 --> 17:07.413
- Babe, why's the
nanny cam on the bed?

17:07.758 --> 17:09.586
- Oh I must've forgot
to put it back up there.

17:09.586 --> 17:11.034
I had to change the battery.

17:11.241 --> 17:12.275
- Oh okay.

17:29.551 --> 17:30.965
- Babe, did you bring my tea up?

17:34.137 --> 17:34.689
Babe, what...

17:36.551 --> 17:38.551
Why are you in the bed so early?

17:38.551 --> 17:39.896
- Waiting for you,
my sexy housewife.

17:42.482 --> 17:43.931
Now we can record it.

17:43.931 --> 17:45.275
When you don't wanna give
me some I can just watch it.

17:45.275 --> 17:45.827
- What?

17:48.448 --> 17:50.413
No you did not.

17:50.413 --> 17:52.344
You are so silly.

17:52.344 --> 17:54.068
- Look babe, I'm
all ready to go.

17:54.068 --> 17:55.413
- Uh-uh.

17:55.413 --> 17:56.689
I'm not doing this with you.

17:57.448 --> 17:58.482
Crazy.

18:03.379 --> 18:04.793
My sexy ass husband.

18:08.482 --> 18:09.413
I just started my period.

18:11.379 --> 18:12.275
- Aw babe, for real?

18:13.448 --> 18:14.103
- I know-

18:14.103 --> 18:14.620
- You said tonight.

18:15.103 --> 18:16.413
-I've been looking forward
to this all day.

18:16.413 --> 18:18.137
What do you want me to do?
It just popped out of no where.

18:18.137 --> 18:18.689
Sue me.

18:29.379 --> 18:30.965
Oh okay, Mr. Attitude.

18:33.206 --> 18:34.206
I love you.

18:39.793 --> 18:41.068
Is my hubby mad at me?

18:42.068 --> 18:46.275
Are you mad 'cause you can't
get any and you gotta wait?

20:54.206 --> 20:55.310
Wake up!

20:55.310 --> 20:55.862
Wake up!

20:58.172 --> 20:59.448
- What's wrong babe?

21:01.172 --> 21:02.620
- When you
got up last night

21:02.620 --> 21:04.172
you must've taken her
out of her crib.

21:04.172 --> 21:04.551
- Huh?

21:04.862 --> 21:05.724
What are you talking about?

21:05.896 --> 21:06.655
- Why would I do that?

21:06.655 --> 21:07.275
- Are you hurt?

21:07.275 --> 21:07.896
Are you okay baby?

21:07.896 --> 21:08.586
Let me see.

21:08.586 --> 21:09.310
Let mommy look at you.

21:09.413 --> 21:10.275
Are you hurt?

21:10.344 --> 21:11.103
- She was in our bed?

21:11.482 --> 21:13.862
- No, she was laying on
the floor next to her crib.

21:14.068 --> 21:14.689
- Really?

21:15.827 --> 21:17.206
- Yes.

21:17.206 --> 21:18.931
- Are you messing with me?

21:18.931 --> 21:20.068
How did she get out of her crib?

21:20.379 --> 21:22.206
- Probably got out her
crib the same way

21:22.448 --> 21:23.482
you left the refrigerator open.

21:25.448 --> 21:28.275
- I mean I know I got up
and I went to the kitchen,

21:28.275 --> 21:30.068
but I just don't
remember picking her up.

21:30.068 --> 21:31.310
But maybe I did.

21:32.724 --> 21:34.000
- Yeah, you
don't remember.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.172
Just like you don't remember

21:35.172 --> 21:35.862
leaving the refrigerator open!

21:35.862 --> 21:38.000
- Okay, okay, okay.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.655
I just can't believe I did that.

21:39.655 --> 21:41.034
- Me either.

21:41.034 --> 21:41.931
- Come here, Bri.

21:41.931 --> 21:42.931
Daddy's sorry, pumpkin.

21:42.931 --> 21:44.827
- Can you just go feed the dogs?

21:59.517 --> 22:00.517
- What the fuck?

22:00.517 --> 22:01.655
Did you just shit in your food?

22:01.655 --> 22:02.275
Both of y'all?

22:04.000 --> 22:04.965
Really?

22:04.965 --> 22:05.482
Come on.

22:07.448 --> 22:08.448
Come on come on come on come on

22:08.448 --> 22:11.586
come on come on come on come on.

22:11.586 --> 22:13.448
Really?

22:13.448 --> 22:14.793
Can't believe y'all
just did this shit.

22:21.137 --> 22:22.448
- Stop digging in
the grass, Titus!

22:23.103 --> 22:24.965
Titus!

22:25.344 --> 22:26.241
Titus stop digging
in the grass, buddy!

22:29.758 --> 22:30.586
Titus!

22:30.586 --> 22:31.655
Come on.

22:31.655 --> 22:32.931
Come on.

22:32.931 --> 22:34.620
Come on.

22:34.620 --> 22:35.758
Come on, Titus.

22:45.172 --> 22:47.103
- How was your
shower, my sexy man?

22:47.137 --> 22:48.620
- Good.

22:48.620 --> 22:49.413
I needed it.

22:50.586 --> 22:51.275
- What's up?

22:51.275 --> 22:52.137
Something wrong?

22:54.103 --> 22:55.793
- Those dogs still
aren't eating.

22:55.793 --> 22:57.551
- We need to just let
them out of those kennels.

22:58.379 --> 22:59.655
If they poop on the rug oh well.

23:01.793 --> 23:03.310
What?

23:03.310 --> 23:04.862
I mean you know my
dog always eats.

23:04.862 --> 23:05.896
She greedy.

23:05.896 --> 23:07.241
- Not today she isn't.

23:07.241 --> 23:08.827
Hasn't touched her food all day.

23:08.827 --> 23:10.310
This morning I was
really pissed.

23:10.310 --> 23:11.172
- What she do?

23:11.275 --> 23:12.965
- Shit right
in the food bowl.

23:13.000 --> 23:13.724
Right on top of the food.

23:15.655 --> 23:16.724
- What?

23:16.724 --> 23:17.862
Why?

23:17.862 --> 23:18.275
- Who knows.

23:19.827 --> 23:21.000
Maybe it's the food.

23:21.000 --> 23:21.379
New house.

23:22.827 --> 23:24.000
I don't know.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.103
- Ew.

23:26.482 --> 23:27.482
That's weird.

23:31.379 --> 23:32.689
Maybe they're sick.

23:36.137 --> 23:37.172
- Who knows.

23:38.241 --> 23:39.000
It's something.

24:23.586 --> 24:24.689
- Dang babe, what?

24:27.448 --> 24:28.896
- That was the weirdest thing.

24:29.793 --> 24:31.413
Our daughter.

24:31.413 --> 24:33.310
She was staring
at me wide awake.

24:33.310 --> 24:35.620
- Babe, are you sure you
just didn't dream that?

24:35.620 --> 24:36.931
- No, it wasn't a dream.

24:36.931 --> 24:38.310
I know what I saw.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.137
Her eyes were wide open.

24:40.310 --> 24:44.931
- Okay, well she's asleep and
that's what I wanna be doing.

24:44.965 --> 24:47.000
Can we please just go
back to sleep babe?

26:06.000 --> 26:07.379
- Leonard!

27:17.448 --> 27:19.068
- Come here come here come here.

27:19.068 --> 27:20.068
Come here baby.

27:20.068 --> 27:21.448
What the hell was that?

27:21.448 --> 27:22.655
- I don't know, but I'm
about to find out.

27:22.724 --> 27:23.275
- Oh my god.

27:23.551 --> 27:24.896
Wait, you cannot
leave us in here!

27:24.896 --> 27:25.344
- Just wait a minute.

27:25.827 --> 27:27.068
Let me see what the
hell is going on.

27:27.103 --> 27:28.827
- I'm gonna call the police.

27:30.275 --> 27:31.482
- What's wrong buddy?

27:31.482 --> 27:32.931
Hmm?

27:32.965 --> 27:33.931
What's wrong?

27:35.827 --> 27:36.758
What's wrong?

27:48.586 --> 27:49.068
Fufu.

28:32.206 --> 28:33.620
- Are you not gonna
get the door?

28:42.482 --> 28:44.172
- Hi sir, Sheriff Lee Boyd.

28:44.827 --> 28:47.034
Yeah, I heard about your
situation and wonder

28:47.344 --> 28:49.896
if I can please ask
you a few questions.

28:49.931 --> 28:51.551
We're trying to investigate
what happened.

28:51.655 --> 28:53.344
- Okay.

28:53.344 --> 28:54.517
- All right.

28:58.965 --> 29:00.689
So tell me, Leonard is it?

29:00.689 --> 29:02.448
Is that the correct name?

29:02.482 --> 29:03.103
- Yes, Leonard.

29:03.448 --> 29:04.586
Okey-doke.

29:04.586 --> 29:05.620
Sorry, I'm bad with names.

29:07.068 --> 29:10.689
So explain to me what happened.

29:10.724 --> 29:13.206
- Me and my wife were sleeping.

29:13.206 --> 29:15.586
All of a sudden we heard a
loud bang like a door slam.

29:15.620 --> 29:18.206
- Did a door slam, or did just
sound like a door slammed?

29:18.551 --> 29:19.827
- I think a door slammed.

29:19.827 --> 29:21.724
I don't know exactly, but
that's what it sounded like.

29:22.586 --> 29:24.275
Kathy, please babe, sit.

29:24.275 --> 29:26.068
Have a seat.

29:26.103 --> 29:27.275
- It's all clear out back.

29:27.275 --> 29:28.517
No signs of a break in.

29:29.793 --> 29:30.758
- Perfect.

29:30.793 --> 29:32.206
Okay, no sign of a break in.

29:32.206 --> 29:33.379
Continue.

29:33.379 --> 29:34.862
- We jump up.

29:34.862 --> 29:36.482
My wife grabbed the baby.

29:36.482 --> 29:38.310
And that's when I
went to the porch.

29:38.310 --> 29:40.482
And I found my dog all bloody.

29:40.482 --> 29:41.724
- And that's you realized that

29:41.724 --> 29:43.344
the other dog had
been eaten alive?

29:44.689 --> 29:45.689
Oops.

29:47.034 --> 29:49.103
- Yes sheriff, thanks.

29:49.137 --> 29:51.103
- Well, I'm sorry to tell you,

29:51.103 --> 29:52.724
but we have to call
Animal Control.

29:54.310 --> 29:56.379
- So what you're saying is you
guys are gonna kill my dog?

29:56.379 --> 29:57.413
- No no no
I'm not saying that.

29:57.413 --> 29:58.241
- Yes!

29:58.620 --> 29:59.620
Yes!

29:59.793 --> 30:01.137
That's exactly what he's saying.

30:01.137 --> 30:04.655
Your dog killed my Fufu
and we have a daughter!

30:04.655 --> 30:07.586
And she's not safe in the
house with that goddamn dog!

30:10.034 --> 30:11.034
- So here's what's gonna happen.

30:11.034 --> 30:13.379
The dog will not
necessarily be put down.

30:15.379 --> 30:16.758
But he will definitely
be quarantined.

30:16.758 --> 30:17.896
- Quarantined?

30:17.896 --> 30:18.827
- Do you know what rabies are?

30:18.931 --> 30:20.931
- What the fuck is a quarantine
going to do?

30:20.931 --> 30:22.137
Get your dog out of here now!

30:22.137 --> 30:22.793
- Kathy I got it!

30:22.793 --> 30:23.517
I hear you!

30:23.517 --> 30:24.965
- Do you have it?

30:25.655 --> 30:29.034
- They will come around and
pick up the dog within 12 hours.

30:29.034 --> 30:30.275
- That's all right.

30:30.275 --> 30:31.482
I'll take him when
I go into work.

30:31.482 --> 30:32.103
- Do you want to take him?

30:32.103 --> 30:33.034
- No!

30:33.655 --> 30:37.103
You take your fucking dog now!

31:05.206 --> 31:06.586
Grab your clothes.

31:06.655 --> 31:07.689
- Grab my clothes?

31:07.758 --> 31:08.655
- Peek-a-boo!

31:08.965 --> 31:09.793
- Grab my clothes.

31:11.103 --> 31:11.965
Peek-a-boo!

31:12.586 --> 31:13.517
- Peek-a-boo!

31:13.517 --> 31:14.310
Use your pillow.

31:16.758 --> 31:17.620
Peek-a-boo!

31:20.931 --> 31:22.172
You gonna play with me?

31:22.172 --> 31:23.448
- Yeah.

31:23.448 --> 31:24.586
- You ready?

31:24.586 --> 31:25.103
- Peek-a-boo!

31:26.103 --> 31:27.344
- Peek-a-boo!
- Peek-a-boo!

31:29.620 --> 31:31.068
- Peek-a-boo!
- Peek-a-boo!

32:35.413 --> 32:36.586
- Peek-a-boo!

33:06.827 --> 33:07.551
- No!

33:30.068 --> 33:31.758
- Mommy.

33:31.758 --> 33:33.655
Open the door, mommy.

33:47.827 --> 33:49.275
Mommy.

33:49.310 --> 33:50.827
- Get the fuck away from me!

33:57.137 --> 33:59.620
- Open
the fucking door, mommy.

33:59.620 --> 34:01.551
- Mommy.

34:01.620 --> 34:03.620
Open the door, mommy.

34:04.137 --> 34:05.137
- Shit.

34:06.344 --> 34:06.862
Mommy.

34:08.655 --> 34:09.827
Open the door, mommy.

34:14.482 --> 34:16.034
- Baby come home.

34:16.172 --> 34:17.413
Come home.

34:17.413 --> 34:19.241
- Open the door!

34:19.379 --> 34:20.206
- Come home.

34:20.448 --> 34:21.310
Now.

34:21.344 --> 34:22.172
Please.

34:30.000 --> 34:31.172
- Kathy!

34:31.172 --> 34:32.793
- I'm in here!

34:32.793 --> 34:33.344
Hurry hurry!

34:33.344 --> 34:34.034
- Kathy!

34:36.275 --> 34:37.172
- Baby!

34:37.344 --> 34:37.862
Baby!

34:38.965 --> 34:39.827
The camera.

34:39.862 --> 34:40.689
The camera.

34:40.724 --> 34:41.379
- The camera?

34:41.482 --> 34:42.379
- Where's Bri?

34:42.413 --> 34:43.241
- She's fine.

34:43.310 --> 34:44.241
- No she's not!

34:44.379 --> 34:45.551
- She's fine, she's
crawling around the room.

34:45.551 --> 34:46.379
- No she's not!

34:46.379 --> 34:47.172
- Kathy!

34:47.172 --> 34:47.965
- She chased me!

34:49.206 --> 34:50.827
Oh my god, she's
right behind me!

34:50.862 --> 34:51.655
- Okay, hold on!

34:54.379 --> 34:55.310
- Yes.

34:55.655 --> 34:57.000
Yes Mr. Taylor, I am.

34:57.896 --> 34:59.344
What's wrong?

34:59.413 --> 35:01.379
- I need your help sir, please.

35:01.482 --> 35:03.137
- Excuse me?

35:03.137 --> 35:04.517
- I'm in my house.

35:04.620 --> 35:06.034
- Wait, wait.

36:10.758 --> 36:12.241
Leonard, are you here?

36:39.586 --> 36:40.965
Please bless this house.

36:50.103 --> 36:50.655
Mr. Taylor!

36:58.413 --> 36:59.310
Kathy?

37:19.034 --> 37:20.000
Brianna?

37:22.758 --> 37:24.482
Is that you?

37:24.482 --> 37:25.655
- No!

37:26.137 --> 37:26.551
- Brianna.

37:28.413 --> 37:29.931
It's Pastor Hunt.

37:29.931 --> 37:34.000
- Not Brianna, Pastor Hunt.

37:38.413 --> 37:40.655
You're not welcomed here.

37:41.344 --> 37:42.724
- In the name of
the holy spirit.

37:43.827 --> 37:45.206
I order you to leave this house

37:45.206 --> 37:47.000
of God and to
release this child.

37:49.241 --> 37:51.413
- No no no!

37:51.413 --> 37:53.241
- You will release this child.

38:00.206 --> 38:02.586
You have no place in this home.

38:03.000 --> 38:07.620
In the strength of the holy
spirit, I cleanse this child.

38:13.275 --> 38:13.793
Jesus.

38:17.103 --> 38:19.724
- What's wrong, pastor?

38:20.310 --> 38:23.413
- In the strength of the holy
spirit, I cleanse this child.

38:23.965 --> 38:26.000
I rebuke this demon out of here!

38:26.103 --> 38:27.482
I rebuke this demon out!

38:27.724 --> 38:29.448
I rebuke this demon out!

38:29.448 --> 38:30.793
I rebuke this demon out of here!

38:30.793 --> 38:32.103
I rebuke this demon out of here!

38:32.103 --> 38:33.206
I rebuke this demon.

38:44.758 --> 38:46.896
- Pastor Hunt, how
did this happen?

38:47.310 --> 38:50.413
We go to church every Sunday.

38:50.482 --> 38:51.827
We're good people.

38:52.103 --> 38:55.482
- Mrs. Taylor, a demon can
just come across your path.

38:55.655 --> 38:57.379
- So is our child possessed?

38:57.448 --> 38:58.689
- No.

38:58.689 --> 39:01.482
I wouldn't say she's
possessed, but I do think

39:01.482 --> 39:04.379
whatever or whoever is
using her as a passageway.

39:06.379 --> 39:08.241
- A passageway?

39:08.413 --> 39:10.862
- When I came to
the house tonight

39:10.862 --> 39:13.000
and saw Brianna I
asked if it was her.

39:14.551 --> 39:15.965
If she was possessed
she would've

39:15.965 --> 39:17.724
said yes just to get to me.

39:17.724 --> 39:19.896
She answered no.

39:19.896 --> 39:22.206
I just felt there was
more she wanted to say.

39:22.206 --> 39:23.689
- So you telling me a demon

39:23.689 --> 39:25.206
is trying to speak
through my daughter?

39:25.206 --> 39:28.241
- Well I'm afraid so, but we're

39:28.241 --> 39:30.586
not sure if it's a
demon or a spirit.

39:30.586 --> 39:32.241
- But what
the hell is it?

39:32.241 --> 39:33.482
- I don't know yet.

39:34.413 --> 39:36.206
But I won't stop
until I find out.

39:36.862 --> 39:38.034
I promise.

39:38.034 --> 39:40.000
- So what does that mean?

39:41.655 --> 39:44.482
That she'll turn into
that thing again?

39:44.827 --> 39:47.724
- I would say no, but with
the dog being murdered

39:47.724 --> 39:50.724
so viciously, I don't
know what will happen.

39:50.724 --> 39:53.724
- Leonard, I don't feel
safe in this house anymore.

39:53.724 --> 39:56.551
- Mrs. Taylor, I understand
how you're feeling,

39:56.931 --> 39:59.137
but the spirit has made a
connection with your daughter.

39:59.310 --> 40:01.689
- So you're saying it doesn't
matter if we leave or not.

40:02.206 --> 40:03.655
- Yes, I'm afraid so.

40:03.655 --> 40:05.827
- So how am I supposed
to handle all this?

40:05.827 --> 40:06.689
How am I supposed to
protect my family?

40:27.655 --> 40:30.068
- The Almighty One
is your shield.

40:30.068 --> 40:31.586
If you sense another
episode is starting,

40:31.586 --> 40:33.827
you need to start
praying loudly.

40:34.206 --> 40:35.793
Find a scripture
that's very meaningful

40:35.793 --> 40:37.172
to you and say it with passion.

40:39.000 --> 40:39.862
Do not fear.

40:40.655 --> 40:41.379
Because it will
feed off your fear.

40:41.379 --> 40:43.655
Be very firm with it.

40:44.655 --> 40:46.827
And pray, Mr. and Mrs. Taylor.

40:48.137 --> 40:48.793
Don't worry.

40:49.482 --> 40:50.448
You'll get through this.

41:01.379 --> 41:03.344
- Are you Brianna?

41:05.931 --> 41:07.862
I love you so much, baby.

41:12.241 --> 41:13.896
- How you guys doing, baby?

41:19.379 --> 41:20.724
Honey, you okay?

41:23.379 --> 41:24.620
Honey, you okay?

41:25.931 --> 41:27.000
Please babe, don't be upset.

41:27.931 --> 41:29.413
- How can I not be?

41:31.862 --> 41:34.275
I'm scared to death
of my own child.

41:34.689 --> 41:35.103
- Okay.

41:37.586 --> 41:39.310
- I can barely
even look at her.

41:39.310 --> 41:41.206
- We have to stay
positive, all right?

41:43.413 --> 41:44.413
- "Stay positive."

41:44.413 --> 41:45.448
Shit, how?

41:45.448 --> 41:47.034
- Kathy.

41:47.034 --> 41:48.517
- How am I supposed
to stay positive?

41:48.517 --> 41:50.551
- Kathy, listen, Kathy.

41:50.551 --> 41:52.241
We'll figure this out together.

41:52.241 --> 41:53.241
Kathy, are you drinking now?

41:53.241 --> 41:56.103
- Yes I'm drinking, Leonard!

41:56.103 --> 41:57.896
I'm losing my goddamn mind here!

41:57.896 --> 41:59.137
- Okay, okay.

41:59.137 --> 42:00.206
Okay.

42:00.206 --> 42:01.344
- And you're not doing anything

42:01.344 --> 42:02.275
to help the situation
by the way.

42:02.275 --> 42:04.000
- What am I supposed to do?

42:04.000 --> 42:05.758
- A lot more than
what you are doing.

42:06.793 --> 42:07.758
- Kathy, maybe you need to get

42:07.758 --> 42:09.413
out of the house for a while.

42:09.413 --> 42:10.931
All right?

42:10.931 --> 42:12.620
- You're right.

42:13.448 --> 42:15.413
I need to get out of this
fucking house period!

42:15.413 --> 42:17.931
- Shh, breathe.

42:17.931 --> 42:19.172
Kathy, please, you're
not the only one.

42:21.172 --> 42:23.000
- Did it kill your dog?

42:24.172 --> 42:24.931
No.

42:24.931 --> 42:26.413
It didn't.

42:26.413 --> 42:29.103
It killed mine.

42:29.103 --> 42:29.620
- Kathy
we're a family.

42:29.620 --> 42:30.517
- It's after me!

42:30.517 --> 42:31.965
Not you.

42:32.862 --> 42:34.103
You know what, you're right.

42:34.103 --> 42:35.724
I do need to get out of here.

42:35.724 --> 42:37.931
I'm gonna go to
this spa with Liz.

42:37.931 --> 42:40.275
And when I come back
home, if I come back,

42:40.275 --> 42:42.137
maybe I'll be a lot
more positive.

42:42.172 --> 42:43.000
- Kathy.

42:47.931 --> 42:48.862
Come here, baby.

42:48.862 --> 42:50.517
Come here.

42:50.517 --> 42:51.482
It's okay.

42:51.482 --> 42:52.344
Come here.

42:53.275 --> 42:54.482
It's okay.

42:54.482 --> 42:55.793
Whoa, here we go!

42:55.793 --> 42:57.310
Whoa!

42:57.310 --> 42:58.000
- I want mommy.

43:00.655 --> 43:01.586
- Everything will be all right.

43:01.586 --> 43:02.551
Daddy's here.

43:03.241 --> 43:04.758
I'm not going anywhere.

43:04.758 --> 43:06.241
Come on, shh.

43:06.241 --> 43:07.896
This is for you,
close your eyes.

43:07.896 --> 43:08.827
Everything will be right.

43:08.827 --> 43:10.172
Daddy's here.

43:35.724 --> 43:37.241
Hello?

43:37.241 --> 43:38.172
- Mr. Taylor.

43:38.172 --> 43:39.655
It's Pastor Hunt.

43:40.827 --> 43:42.241
How are you two making out?

43:43.103 --> 43:44.172
- Good, good.

43:44.172 --> 43:45.172
Kathy ended up at the spa.

43:45.172 --> 43:47.482
She's been gone most of the day.

43:47.482 --> 43:48.482
- I see.

43:50.241 --> 43:53.034
Well we all handle stressful
situations in our own way.

43:55.379 --> 43:56.000
- Pastor Hunt.

44:00.413 --> 44:01.344
I don't know how
much more of this

44:01.344 --> 44:02.827
she's gonna be able to take.

44:04.793 --> 44:06.551
- It's a very
upsetting situation.

44:07.724 --> 44:08.793
How are you holding up?

44:08.793 --> 44:10.068
- Good.

44:10.068 --> 44:11.448
Just put Brianna down to sleep.

44:12.793 --> 44:13.827
- How was the child's

44:13.827 --> 44:14.965
interaction with you two today?

44:14.965 --> 44:16.241
- Good.

44:16.241 --> 44:17.482
As if nothing ever happened.

44:18.551 --> 44:19.758
- Okay.

44:21.344 --> 44:23.896
Well I have some things
I wanna share with you,

44:23.896 --> 44:25.068
but I wanna come by and talk

44:25.068 --> 44:26.586
to you and your wife together.

44:27.137 --> 44:28.310
- Good things?

44:29.551 --> 44:31.241
- Yes and no.

44:31.241 --> 44:33.827
There's some positives
and some negatives.

44:33.827 --> 44:35.275
- How bad are the negatives?

44:35.655 --> 44:37.068
- Well the
biggest negative is time.

44:37.068 --> 44:37.551
- Time?

44:39.448 --> 44:40.758
- Yes.

44:40.758 --> 44:42.413
We may not have as
much as I thought.

44:43.965 --> 44:45.793
That's why I'm
headed your way now.

44:45.793 --> 44:47.620
I'll be there in 45 minutes.

44:48.655 --> 44:50.241
- Okay, good.

44:50.241 --> 44:51.137
Kathy should be back by then.

44:51.137 --> 44:52.551
I'll see you soon.

44:52.551 --> 44:53.724
- Yes.

45:11.206 --> 45:11.965
- Daddy!

45:11.965 --> 45:12.379
- Brianna!

45:14.413 --> 45:15.620
The Lord is my light.

45:15.620 --> 45:17.206
And my salvation.

45:17.206 --> 45:19.068
Whom shall I fear?

45:19.068 --> 45:20.586
- Daddy!

45:20.586 --> 45:21.206
- The Lord is the
strength of my life.

45:21.206 --> 45:23.482
- Daddy!

45:23.482 --> 45:25.206
- She's mine!

45:30.310 --> 45:31.310
- Daddy!

45:34.310 --> 45:35.793
- Though I walk in the
valley of the shadow

45:35.793 --> 45:38.379
of death I shall fear no evil.

45:41.068 --> 45:42.103
- Daddy!

45:49.793 --> 45:51.344
- Keep praying!

46:05.793 --> 46:06.344
- Mr. Taylor?

46:27.758 --> 46:28.551
- The Lord is
the strength of my light!

46:28.551 --> 46:30.103
Of whom shall I be afraid?

46:31.689 --> 46:33.413
- Mr. Taylor.

46:34.172 --> 46:36.034
- Of the shadow of
death I shall fear no evil.

46:39.551 --> 46:41.551
The Lord is my light
and my salvation.

46:41.551 --> 46:43.034
- Leonard!

46:43.034 --> 46:44.413
Leonard, hey.

46:44.896 --> 46:46.137
Come on.

46:46.137 --> 46:47.103
Come on come on.

46:48.448 --> 46:48.793
Come on.

46:50.241 --> 46:51.206
Come on come on.

47:00.482 --> 47:03.793
My bishop doesn't think
it's an exorcism.

47:04.620 --> 47:07.275
Your daughter's not possessed.

47:07.275 --> 47:10.310
Like we spoke about before,
she's being used as a messenger.

47:10.310 --> 47:12.137
She has something
to tell one of you.

47:12.137 --> 47:12.931
The connection in the house-

47:12.931 --> 47:13.413
- I think it's me.

47:16.241 --> 47:17.793
- What?

47:18.206 --> 47:19.862
What are you talking about?

47:24.655 --> 47:26.448
- The spirit came to
me in the kitchen.

47:26.448 --> 47:27.862
I actually saw its face.

47:27.862 --> 47:28.931
- A face you recognize?

47:28.931 --> 47:29.413
- Yes.

47:31.827 --> 47:33.103
- Are you sure?

47:35.620 --> 47:37.379
- When I was little, a girl came

47:37.379 --> 47:38.793
to live with us for a while.

47:39.620 --> 47:40.517
- With you and your parents?

47:40.517 --> 47:41.931
- No.

47:41.931 --> 47:44.379
My parents died in a car crash.

47:44.379 --> 47:46.965
I lived here with
my grandparents.

47:46.965 --> 47:49.034
This girl came and lived with
us when she was a teenager.

47:49.034 --> 47:49.586
One day.

47:51.827 --> 47:52.931
She just left.

47:56.448 --> 47:57.620
My grandparents
said she ran away.

47:59.034 --> 47:59.862
- And how old were you?

47:59.862 --> 48:01.241
- Little, seven.

48:01.241 --> 48:02.310
Eight.

48:03.344 --> 48:06.517
It was her face I
saw in the kitchen.

48:06.517 --> 48:08.000
- Baby, I don't know.

48:08.000 --> 48:09.413
- It was her.

48:09.413 --> 48:10.344
It was her.

48:14.103 --> 48:16.172
- You still have the footage
from the video camera correct?

48:16.172 --> 48:17.448
- Yeah.

48:17.448 --> 48:18.758
Yeah, it's on the nanny cam.

48:18.758 --> 48:19.896
- Can I see it?

48:19.896 --> 48:21.655
- Yeah, of course.

48:33.206 --> 48:35.068
- This.

48:35.068 --> 48:36.655
Is a new device.

48:38.103 --> 48:40.689
With many video cameras, a
tiny amount of information

48:40.689 --> 48:42.758
from the infrared
spectrum is recorded.

48:42.758 --> 48:44.448
This can filter that
and enhance it.

48:44.448 --> 48:45.068
- Really?

48:45.068 --> 48:46.793
- Yes.

48:46.793 --> 48:50.000
So if this fits in
here, we can pretty much

48:50.000 --> 48:52.724
see anything that comes
across the screen.

48:52.724 --> 48:55.344
- It's standard,
so it should fit.

48:55.344 --> 48:56.827
- Is this an easy process?

48:57.896 --> 48:59.586
- This machine-

48:59.827 --> 49:00.724
- No, the spirit.

49:00.724 --> 49:02.000
When will this all be done?

49:03.931 --> 49:05.724
- Mr. Taylor, how can we
know the answer to that?

49:07.413 --> 49:10.034
How can we know when the
spirit will be heard?

49:16.172 --> 49:17.448
The visual is a little blurry.

49:20.172 --> 49:22.068
Now.

49:22.068 --> 49:23.655
When you hit this.

49:31.896 --> 49:32.620
- Oh my god!

49:32.620 --> 49:33.379
Please turn it off!

49:33.379 --> 49:34.620
- I'm sorry.

49:34.620 --> 49:35.931
You don't need to see this.

49:35.931 --> 49:36.758
My peers are the ones
that need to see this.

49:36.758 --> 49:38.827
They will have the answers.

49:38.827 --> 49:40.724
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to put you...

49:42.551 --> 49:43.586
- I'm sorry, man.

49:44.344 --> 49:47.068
She's having a really hard
time with this whole...

49:47.344 --> 49:49.103
I mean I am too.

49:49.551 --> 49:51.103
- No need to apologize.

49:51.931 --> 49:53.344
But if what you're
saying about the girl

49:53.344 --> 49:55.137
is true you need to
get more information.

49:55.310 --> 49:56.758
I mean is there
anyone else you can

49:56.758 --> 49:58.000
talk to who might know more?

49:59.620 --> 50:01.103
- My grandfather
might have been able

50:05.344 --> 50:07.689
Haven't tried to talk
to him in years.

50:07.689 --> 50:10.103
- Well maybe it's time
you gave it a try.

50:13.965 --> 50:14.482
- Okay.

50:46.620 --> 50:48.034
- Give me back my medicine!

50:50.068 --> 50:52.068
Give me back my medicine!

50:52.068 --> 50:53.896
- Barbara, he didn't
take your medicine.

50:53.896 --> 50:54.758
- Yes he did.

50:54.758 --> 50:55.482
Get outta here.

51:24.137 --> 51:25.172
- Excuse me!

51:25.482 --> 51:27.448
Only family members
can come in before 3.

51:30.310 --> 51:32.172
- I am.

51:32.172 --> 51:33.482
Bernard's my grandfather.

51:36.827 --> 51:38.137
- You're not on the list, so.

51:38.137 --> 51:39.724
- But he's my grandfather.

51:39.724 --> 51:40.620
- Mr. Jones
said he wants you

51:40.620 --> 51:42.241
to bring him them meds.

51:42.241 --> 51:43.344
- Tyree, I can't right now.

51:43.344 --> 51:44.827
Can you just do your job?

51:44.827 --> 51:45.827
Jesus Christ.

51:45.827 --> 51:46.448
Hey!

51:46.827 --> 51:47.482
Hey!

51:47.482 --> 51:48.862
He's eating plants!

51:49.206 --> 51:50.827
Can you please stop
him from eating plants?

51:50.827 --> 51:51.344
- Hello!

51:52.655 --> 51:54.137
- I don't think you understand.

51:54.206 --> 51:56.517
Bernard hasn't had a
visitor in 15 years.

51:56.517 --> 52:00.758
I mean the man doesn't
even speak, so I don't know

52:00.758 --> 52:02.344
what makes you think
he'd wanna talk to you.

52:02.551 --> 52:03.689
No offense.

52:03.689 --> 52:05.137
- My grandfather raised
me since I was three.

52:05.137 --> 52:06.379
He's like a father to me.

52:06.379 --> 52:07.413
I want him to see what
I've grown to be.

52:07.413 --> 52:08.275
- Oh my god.

52:08.275 --> 52:09.275
- Please don't deny me that.

52:09.275 --> 52:10.724
- All right, look,
you have 20 minutes.

52:10.724 --> 52:11.862
Not a minute more.

52:11.862 --> 52:12.551
You can sign in over there.

52:18.379 --> 52:20.448
Hey!

52:20.448 --> 52:22.241
236 is up the
stairs to the left.

52:22.241 --> 52:24.206
20 minutes.

52:27.862 --> 52:29.241
- Hey.

52:29.241 --> 52:30.586
People on this wing
can be a little touchy.

52:30.586 --> 52:31.551
I'm just letting you know.

52:54.206 --> 52:54.620
- Grandpa.

52:58.137 --> 52:59.862
Grandpa, it's Leonard.

52:59.862 --> 53:01.344
I know it's been a
long time, but.

53:05.172 --> 53:05.827
I'm married now.

53:07.620 --> 53:08.413
Beautiful baby girl.

53:09.586 --> 53:10.068
Brianna.

53:12.000 --> 53:13.586
You got a great-granddaughter.

53:15.931 --> 53:16.448
Grandpa.

53:18.931 --> 53:19.448
Grandpa.

53:21.586 --> 53:23.103
Grandpa it's me-

53:27.655 --> 53:28.827
- It's me.

53:28.827 --> 53:29.758
Leonard.

53:35.172 --> 53:36.206
- Hey, hey!

53:36.206 --> 53:37.448
- What did I tell you?

53:38.103 --> 53:40.000
He's strong for an old man, huh?

53:40.000 --> 53:40.827
And he quick too.

53:42.344 --> 53:43.758
That old man strength
ain't nothing to play with.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.620
- I know I haven't
come to see you.

53:55.517 --> 53:57.137
And I have no excuse for that.

53:58.620 --> 54:00.517
But I'm coming to you
now in need of help.

54:08.379 --> 54:12.275
I don't know what's going on,
but my family's in danger.

54:12.689 --> 54:14.482
I've seen things that
I can't explain.

54:18.931 --> 54:20.103
- Your time is up.

54:20.103 --> 54:21.241
- Please, just a
few more minutes.

54:21.241 --> 54:22.000
- It's his medication time.

54:22.068 --> 54:23.758
It's time for you to go.

54:24.034 --> 54:24.896
- I saw her.

54:26.241 --> 54:27.482
I saw Crystal.

54:28.758 --> 54:30.551
Grandpa please!

54:30.551 --> 54:32.551
She has control my baby girl!

54:32.551 --> 54:33.517
- Get this man out of here now.

54:34.931 --> 54:36.103
- Hey!

54:36.103 --> 54:37.482
Hey, I'm sorry, you
have to leave!

54:37.517 --> 54:38.689
- Grandpa!

54:38.689 --> 54:40.172
- You have to leave!

54:42.344 --> 54:43.827
- No grandpa!

54:50.310 --> 54:50.862
Grandpa!

54:55.551 --> 54:56.068
Grandpa!

55:02.793 --> 55:04.379
- Camille.

55:04.965 --> 55:07.413
You were pretty like
that girl once.

55:07.896 --> 55:08.379
Nice.

55:09.896 --> 55:10.379
Sweet.

55:11.896 --> 55:13.413
But you changed over the years.

55:13.655 --> 55:15.068
Your heart grew cold.

55:15.827 --> 55:17.413
A young girl in the house.

55:17.620 --> 55:21.103
You look so beautiful
in this dress.

55:21.379 --> 55:22.241
Was trouble.

55:23.448 --> 55:26.724
Hey, let me help you out of it.

55:26.758 --> 55:30.551
Everything's gonna be okay.

55:37.620 --> 55:39.068
Pretty just like her mama.

55:43.344 --> 55:45.551
Not everybody loved
that baby though.

55:53.965 --> 55:54.931
- Leonard?

55:58.068 --> 55:59.448
How long have you
been watching me?

55:59.620 --> 56:00.551
- Got this for you.

56:05.655 --> 56:07.172
- Do you have a
crush on someone?

56:09.551 --> 56:10.103
You do.

56:12.206 --> 56:13.172
You wanna put it in?

56:22.206 --> 56:23.103
It's beautiful.

56:26.344 --> 56:28.724
Well I think you're
pretty special too.

56:28.724 --> 56:31.724
But you can't peek on girls
while they're getting dressed.

56:32.206 --> 56:35.000
But since you're my
special little cuddle bug

56:35.000 --> 56:36.655
I guess it's okay this time.

56:45.241 --> 56:47.517
- You two better get
on to the party.

56:56.965 --> 56:58.827
- I remember it like
it was yesterday.

57:02.586 --> 57:03.689
- You remember what?

57:07.689 --> 57:08.931
You remember what?

57:11.137 --> 57:12.448
What'd you do?

57:13.137 --> 57:14.793
- Okay
you need to leave now.

57:17.448 --> 57:19.172
- My baby girl doesn't
deserve this, grandpa!

57:21.448 --> 57:22.517
This isn't over!

57:39.275 --> 57:40.103
Pastor Hunt.

57:41.241 --> 57:43.448
I think I know what happened.

57:43.448 --> 57:45.103
Meet me at my house,
I'm almost there.

57:45.965 --> 57:47.965
- Okay, wait wait wait.

58:07.275 --> 58:08.586
- I know what happened.

58:11.448 --> 58:13.137
He has something to do
with crystal disappearing.

58:13.137 --> 58:14.103
I know he does.

58:14.103 --> 58:15.000
- He who?

58:15.000 --> 58:15.758
- My grandfather.

58:15.793 --> 58:16.517
Here.

58:16.517 --> 58:19.655
This dirt was in
my house before.

58:19.655 --> 58:21.275
As soon as I retrieve her
body this will all be over.

58:21.655 --> 58:22.689
Her soul will be at rest.

58:46.620 --> 58:47.655
That bastard.

59:32.724 --> 59:35.000
- I see we got the same taste.

59:45.517 --> 59:46.586
Huh?

59:48.000 --> 59:50.172
- Crystal, go ahead
and finish up

59:50.172 --> 59:51.931
those dishes before
you go to bed.

59:51.931 --> 59:53.000
You understand?

59:53.000 --> 59:54.000
- Yes Camille.

59:55.586 --> 59:56.724
- And honey.

59:56.758 --> 59:57.724
- Yes baby?

59:57.724 --> 59:59.137
- I put
Leonard to bed.

1:00:00.241 --> 1:00:02.689
And I'll be home
around 8 AM, okay?

1:00:04.724 --> 1:00:06.206
- Have a great night.

1:00:06.206 --> 1:00:07.275
- You too, baby.

1:00:07.275 --> 1:00:08.241
Love you.

1:00:08.517 --> 1:00:09.586
- Love you!

1:00:09.689 --> 1:00:11.344
- Love you more.

1:00:17.931 --> 1:00:20.034
- Crystal.

1:00:20.034 --> 1:00:22.517
Go upstairs, brush your
teeth, and get into bed.

1:00:22.517 --> 1:00:24.482
- But she asked
me to put the dishes away.

1:00:26.379 --> 1:00:28.000
- What did I say?

1:00:30.724 --> 1:00:31.413
Hey.

1:00:56.689 --> 1:00:57.241
- No!

1:00:57.931 --> 1:00:58.482
No!

1:01:06.137 --> 1:01:06.620
Stop!

1:01:09.137 --> 1:01:09.620
Stop!

1:01:12.896 --> 1:01:14.103
Stop please!

1:01:26.275 --> 1:01:26.827
Stop!

1:01:30.137 --> 1:01:30.620
Stop!

1:01:33.482 --> 1:01:34.000
Stop!

1:01:43.620 --> 1:01:45.000
- Honey would you
like bacon and eggs?

1:01:45.172 --> 1:01:46.137
- Yes.

1:01:48.241 --> 1:01:49.344
- Would you like some fruit?

1:01:49.344 --> 1:01:50.379
I have some apple here.

1:01:51.551 --> 1:01:52.103
- Yes.

1:01:52.241 --> 1:01:52.724
- Okay.

1:01:56.793 --> 1:01:57.379
Here you go.

1:01:57.379 --> 1:01:57.965
How's that look?

1:01:57.965 --> 1:01:58.965
- Beautiful.

1:01:58.965 --> 1:02:00.344
- All right, great honey.

1:02:00.344 --> 1:02:02.724
Crystal, would you like
to have what he's having?

1:02:03.724 --> 1:02:04.655
- Yes.

1:02:04.724 --> 1:02:05.379
- Okay.

1:02:06.827 --> 1:02:08.724
Quite an appetite
this morning for you.

1:02:13.551 --> 1:02:14.793
Here you go sweetie.

1:02:34.206 --> 1:02:36.000
Get this out of my house now.

1:03:02.310 --> 1:03:03.379
- It's done.

1:03:44.413 --> 1:03:45.241
- Crystal?

1:04:01.482 --> 1:04:03.965
- You were
like a mother to me!

1:04:04.620 --> 1:04:06.758
You let him break me!

1:04:07.310 --> 1:04:09.413
Over and over!

1:04:10.034 --> 1:04:12.137
You never cared!

1:04:19.827 --> 1:04:22.172
Why didn't you help me?

1:04:47.344 --> 1:04:48.793
- It's you.

1:04:48.793 --> 1:04:49.827
Hey, hey!

1:04:49.827 --> 1:04:50.655
Hey!

1:04:50.655 --> 1:04:52.862
Hey!

1:04:52.862 --> 1:04:54.517
- I need to see him now
before the sheriff gets here.

1:04:54.517 --> 1:04:55.344
He's about to be
arrested for a murder.

1:04:55.344 --> 1:04:56.655
- Murder?

1:04:56.655 --> 1:04:57.655
Nah, I haven't heard that.

1:04:57.655 --> 1:04:58.379
- You were there, you heard him.

1:04:58.379 --> 1:05:00.000
Nah, I haven't heard that.

1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:01.689
There isn't much time!

1:05:01.689 --> 1:05:04.068
- Tyree, Tyree, we
need to help this man.

1:05:45.896 --> 1:05:47.379
- We got a 1029, roll the ambo.

1:05:51.758 --> 1:05:52.310
- It's.

1:05:53.827 --> 1:05:54.344
Not.

1:05:56.344 --> 1:05:58.000
Over.

1:06:17.482 --> 1:06:19.103
- Good morning, Mr. Taylor.

1:06:19.103 --> 1:06:20.103
These are the rest of your
grandfather's possessions

1:06:20.103 --> 1:06:21.482
the DA's office turned in to us.

1:06:21.482 --> 1:06:23.413
If you could please sign here.

1:06:28.482 --> 1:06:29.965
Thank you man.

1:06:29.965 --> 1:06:31.758
- Yup.

1:06:31.758 --> 1:06:33.827
- At least he don't gotta
go on trial for two.

1:06:33.827 --> 1:06:34.965
- Deputy Timmons.

1:06:36.551 --> 1:06:37.068
Two?

1:06:39.448 --> 1:06:39.793
- Yeah.

1:06:41.931 --> 1:06:43.965
I guess there's no harm now.

1:06:43.965 --> 1:06:46.000
The coroner found out she
was pregnant when she died.

1:06:46.896 --> 1:06:47.793
- Really?

1:06:47.793 --> 1:06:48.896
- Yeah man.

1:06:48.896 --> 1:06:49.379
Well.

1:06:50.724 --> 1:06:51.655
Sorry man.

1:06:52.758 --> 1:06:53.827
Have a good day.

1:07:05.344 --> 1:07:06.344
- What's all this?

1:07:08.206 --> 1:07:10.000
- Some stuff the
sheriff dropped by.

1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:10.896
Stuff they got off grandpa.

1:07:10.896 --> 1:07:12.724
- Okay.

1:07:24.034 --> 1:07:25.000
- Mama?

1:07:34.206 --> 1:07:36.172
- Let me see that picture, baby.

1:08:07.034 --> 1:08:08.413
- Leonard.

1:08:08.413 --> 1:08:09.551
How could you?

1:08:27.758 --> 1:08:29.310
She can't have her!

1:08:29.310 --> 1:08:30.379
Stay away from her!

1:08:30.379 --> 1:08:31.103
- What, what?

1:08:31.103 --> 1:08:31.931
- No!

1:08:31.931 --> 1:08:33.620
No!

1:08:33.620 --> 1:08:34.758
- What?

1:08:34.758 --> 1:08:35.793
What, who?

1:08:35.793 --> 1:08:37.275
Who?

1:08:37.275 --> 1:08:39.689
- Why won't she walk
for me, Leonard?

1:08:39.689 --> 1:08:41.379
Why?

1:08:41.379 --> 1:08:43.586
She never calls me mama anymore!

1:08:43.586 --> 1:08:44.689
- Kathy.

1:08:44.689 --> 1:08:46.379
Kathy don't.

1:08:46.379 --> 1:08:47.758
- No, something changed.

1:08:49.793 --> 1:08:51.275
Ever since we moved
into this house!

1:08:51.275 --> 1:08:53.655
- Kathy it's okay, baby.

1:08:53.655 --> 1:08:56.206
- You said when you
dug up the bones

1:08:56.206 --> 1:08:58.448
that it was gonna be it.

1:08:58.448 --> 1:09:00.000
That's what you said!

1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:01.344
- No no no, babe, you're
just having a bad stretch.

1:09:01.344 --> 1:09:03.034
- No, you don't understand!

1:09:03.034 --> 1:09:06.103
She's not haunting your
dreams every night for months.

1:09:06.103 --> 1:09:07.413
No, stop it!

1:09:07.413 --> 1:09:08.310
- Kathy, Kathy!

1:09:23.034 --> 1:09:24.137
She can have her.

1:09:25.034 --> 1:09:26.344
- Kathy what are you-

1:09:26.344 --> 1:09:28.000
- That is not my baby.

1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:28.551
- What are you talking about?

1:09:28.551 --> 1:09:29.655
- That is not my baby.

1:09:29.655 --> 1:09:31.724
- That's not my daughter!

1:09:31.724 --> 1:09:32.206
- Listen, you have
to get it together.

1:09:32.206 --> 1:09:34.000
I need you.

1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:35.000
This is something we have to do.

1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:36.862
There's not other option, Kathy.

1:09:36.862 --> 1:09:39.310
- Leonard, I love you, but
I cannot do this anymore.

1:09:40.827 --> 1:09:43.172
We can start over!

1:09:43.172 --> 1:09:44.137
- We will start over.

1:09:44.137 --> 1:09:44.827
We'll pray all night long.

1:09:46.103 --> 1:09:47.137
- No!

1:09:47.137 --> 1:09:48.724
Without her!

1:09:48.724 --> 1:09:50.896
We're gonna start
over without her.

1:09:50.896 --> 1:09:52.000
- What the hell are you
talking about, Kathy?

1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:52.862
- We can have another baby!

1:09:55.965 --> 1:09:58.862
It's obvious that
Crystal, the spirit,

1:09:58.862 --> 1:10:00.448
or whatever the fuck
it is, wants Brianna!

1:10:02.172 --> 1:10:03.344
And if you can't tell.

1:10:05.620 --> 1:10:07.586
That is not Brianna anymore!

1:10:10.344 --> 1:10:11.620
There's not enough prayer

1:10:11.620 --> 1:10:14.000
in the world that
could change that.

1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:15.620
- Why are you giving
up on your faith?

1:10:15.620 --> 1:10:16.620
Why are you giving up on us?

1:10:16.620 --> 1:10:18.172
- I can't fight this!

1:10:18.172 --> 1:10:19.655
I can't fight this anymore.

1:10:22.344 --> 1:10:23.655
- What do you want
me to do, Kathy?

1:10:23.655 --> 1:10:26.793
- I want you to man the fuck up!

1:10:28.551 --> 1:10:30.448
We're giving this baby away.

1:10:32.896 --> 1:10:34.448
- I can't believe you
wanna give her away!

1:10:34.448 --> 1:10:36.517
- Leonard, we don't
have a choice.

1:10:40.724 --> 1:10:41.862
- How are we supposed
to do this Kathy?

1:10:41.862 --> 1:10:42.793
- A shelter.

1:10:42.793 --> 1:10:44.137
An orphanage.

1:10:44.137 --> 1:10:45.344
I don't know.

1:10:46.206 --> 1:10:49.137
I don't care if we gotta go
to a goddamn police station.

1:10:49.137 --> 1:10:50.103
- Kathy.

1:10:50.103 --> 1:10:50.482
- Stop it.

1:10:57.793 --> 1:10:58.793
Are you ready?

1:11:00.379 --> 1:11:02.068
Leonard look at me.

1:11:02.068 --> 1:11:03.034
Look at me.

1:11:03.931 --> 1:11:05.137
Baby look at me.

1:11:06.517 --> 1:11:08.241
I know this is hard okay?

1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:12.068
I don't wanna do it
either, but we have to.

1:11:12.068 --> 1:11:13.241
We have to.

1:11:13.241 --> 1:11:13.758
Okay?

1:11:23.241 --> 1:11:23.758
We gotta go.

1:11:57.344 --> 1:11:59.379
- It's okay.

1:11:59.379 --> 1:12:00.827
You'll be all right, baby.

1:12:03.310 --> 1:12:03.827
Okay.

1:12:06.310 --> 1:12:07.068
Daddy loves you.

1:12:10.103 --> 1:12:10.896
Daddy loves you.

1:12:21.413 --> 1:12:22.931
Daddy loves you, okay?

1:12:22.931 --> 1:12:24.137
- Leonard!

1:12:24.137 --> 1:12:25.000
Let's go!

1:13:13.586 --> 1:13:15.551
Babe, you know what I could
really go for right now?

1:13:16.137 --> 1:13:17.172
- I don't know.

1:13:17.379 --> 1:13:17.965
Let me guess.

1:13:21.448 --> 1:13:22.517
Me.

1:13:24.344 --> 1:13:25.241
- Always.

1:13:25.241 --> 1:13:26.827
I always do that.

1:13:26.827 --> 1:13:31.000
But you would go really good.

1:13:32.482 --> 1:13:34.655
With some chocolate
chip cookie dough.

1:13:34.793 --> 1:13:35.965
- So you want me
to go to the store

1:13:35.965 --> 1:13:37.413
and get you some ice
cream when you got

1:13:37.413 --> 1:13:40.034
this sexy chocolate
brownie right here?

1:13:40.068 --> 1:13:41.965
- Oh you gonna go on
top of the ice cream.

1:13:44.551 --> 1:13:47.379
Baby if you go, you'd be
the best husband ever.

1:13:47.655 --> 1:13:50.448
Plus I got a little
surprise for you tonight.

1:13:51.206 --> 1:13:52.034
- A surprise?

1:13:52.034 --> 1:13:52.862
- Mmmhm.

1:13:53.275 --> 1:13:56.379
But I'm only gonna tell you
if you get me the ice cream.

1:13:56.517 --> 1:13:58.379
- You know I like surprises.

1:13:58.379 --> 1:14:00.344
If I go all the way to the
store and get you some ice cream

1:14:00.655 --> 1:14:03.896
I want the freakiest sex
ever when I get back.

1:14:04.137 --> 1:14:05.068
- Okay, that's a deal.

1:14:06.896 --> 1:14:07.724
- I'm serious, Kathy.

1:14:07.724 --> 1:14:09.620
- I'm serious too, baby.

1:14:09.620 --> 1:14:10.241
Look, you go to the store.

1:14:11.793 --> 1:14:12.862
And while you're gone.

1:14:14.896 --> 1:14:16.413
I'll get in the shower.

1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:20.620
And by the time you get
back, I'm gonna be naked.

1:14:20.620 --> 1:14:24.206
Matter of fact, I'm not even
gonna dry off after the shower.

1:14:24.896 --> 1:14:26.586
- You know I like that.

1:14:53.068 --> 1:14:55.034
- I can't believe
I'm pregnant again.

1:14:59.137 --> 1:14:59.758
Thank you God.

1:15:06.482 --> 1:15:07.586
- Mommy.

1:15:16.206 --> 1:15:16.655
- Brianna?

1:15:20.172 --> 1:15:20.655
Brianna.

1:15:55.275 --> 1:15:56.275
- Yes sir.

1:15:57.827 --> 1:15:59.793
You got a good man, girl.

1:15:59.793 --> 1:16:02.724
It's about to go down.

1:16:04.551 --> 1:16:05.827
It's about to go down.

1:16:10.724 --> 1:16:11.206
Babe!

1:16:12.517 --> 1:16:14.586
I got the whipped cream
and the strawberries!

1:16:16.068 --> 1:16:17.241
It's about to go down!

1:16:18.896 --> 1:16:19.413
Babe!

1:16:21.517 --> 1:16:22.689
Babe!

1:16:51.689 --> 1:16:52.172
Kathy!

1:17:00.241 --> 1:17:00.827
- Daddy!

1:17:08.241 --> 1:17:09.758
- I've been waiting for you.

1:17:19.620 --> 1:17:21.241
Do you have a gift for me?

1:17:25.068 --> 1:17:26.896
I miss you, my
little cuddle bug.

1:17:38.620 --> 1:17:39.241
- Pastor Hunt.

1:17:41.724 --> 1:17:42.965
What's going on with you?

1:17:42.965 --> 1:17:44.103
- How you doing man?

1:17:44.103 --> 1:17:44.793
- Good, good.
- Mr. Taylor.

1:17:45.965 --> 1:17:47.172
- So I haven't seen
you guys in a while.

1:17:47.172 --> 1:17:48.275
Everything okay?

1:17:48.275 --> 1:17:49.103
- Yeah, everything's fine.

1:17:49.103 --> 1:17:50.000
So far.

1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:50.827
- How's the family?

1:17:50.965 --> 1:17:51.758
How's Kathy doing?

1:17:51.758 --> 1:17:52.896
- She's great.

1:17:52.896 --> 1:17:54.137
A changed woman.

1:17:54.137 --> 1:17:55.241
- Wow, well that's
excellent news.

1:17:55.241 --> 1:17:56.275
- Yeah.

1:17:56.275 --> 1:17:57.896
- Yeah.

1:17:57.896 --> 1:17:59.413
- Well I gotta get back.

1:17:59.413 --> 1:18:00.586
I was just in the area.

1:18:00.586 --> 1:18:02.068
Decided to stop by and check in.

1:18:02.068 --> 1:18:03.896
- Okay, I appreciate that.

1:18:04.034 --> 1:18:04.517
Thanks.

1:18:06.482 --> 1:18:07.344
Pastor Hunt.

1:18:09.034 --> 1:18:10.758
Appreciate you for looking
after Bri until Kathy...

1:18:10.758 --> 1:18:12.448
- I had a feeling she
would come back around.

1:18:13.862 --> 1:18:14.896
You have a good one.

1:18:14.965 --> 1:18:15.655
- You too, man.

1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:26.034
- How you doing?

1:18:41.034 --> 1:18:43.034
- I see we
got the same taste.
