00:15.146 --> 00:17.000
I bet you can't do it with three.

00:33.986 --> 00:35.236
I'll take that.

00:37.279 --> 00:38.320
Tie him up, then.

00:38.845 --> 00:40.941
It's from Isabella to Prince John.

00:41.061 --> 00:44.280
"My Prince, I understand the urgency of your request.

00:44.441 --> 00:46.520
Richard returns from the Crusades within the month.

00:46.681 --> 00:49.360
Troops loyal to him await him in
Loughborough. We must be ready."

00:49.778 --> 00:52.960
Richard. King Richard?
The King's coming home.

00:54.586 --> 00:55.720
Read the rest.

00:56.962 --> 00:59.040
"You asked for 300 men, food and supplies.

00:59.465 --> 01:03.465
I will dispatch them at sunset to join
with your northern forces in Doncaster."

01:04.638 --> 01:06.640
So, where has Isabella got 300 men from?

01:07.473 --> 01:09.423
"England will soon be yours."

01:09.562 --> 01:11.160
You give the Sheriff this message.

01:11.321 --> 01:12.321
Go on.

01:13.361 --> 01:15.417
England will never be a slave to Prince John,

01:15.537 --> 01:17.552
not while Robin Hood fights for King Richard.

01:17.672 --> 01:18.480
Robin!

01:19.050 --> 01:20.500
They've taken them!

01:24.663 --> 01:27.200
They took them!
Taken who?

01:27.320 --> 01:29.880
I was in Clun. The Sheriff's soldiers.

01:30.374 --> 01:32.440
They've taken all the men.
How many?

01:32.698 --> 01:35.093
I don't know. Must have been at least 100.

01:35.213 --> 01:37.720
Robin! Same in Nettlestone.

01:38.181 --> 01:40.440
The Sheriff's guard came and just carted them off -

01:40.601 --> 01:41.920
crops and livestock too.

01:42.445 --> 01:44.745
100 from Clun, 100 from Nettlestone.

01:45.426 --> 01:47.261
They'll go to Locksley next.

01:47.381 --> 01:48.640
Get to Locksley!

01:50.905 --> 01:54.805
The Sub Wood Team

02:36.815 --> 02:37.815
Hood!

02:42.393 --> 02:43.994
Come on, then!

02:55.565 --> 02:56.560
Pull back!

02:56.721 --> 02:58.760
Get the supplies to the castle.

03:04.040 --> 03:05.040
Idiots!

03:05.201 --> 03:07.600
Get the prisoners out of there!

03:07.801 --> 03:09.519
John, break the chain!

03:23.853 --> 03:25.120
They're gone.

03:25.574 --> 03:27.674
Let's get these men to Sherwood.

03:48.860 --> 03:50.400
You are an imbecile.

03:56.039 --> 03:57.373
Failure!

04:01.079 --> 04:02.080
Blamire.

04:03.519 --> 04:06.119
Tell me, are the men of Locksley secured?

04:06.272 --> 04:10.120
We had a situation... some unforeseen difficulties.

04:10.831 --> 04:11.881
Robin Hood.

04:12.721 --> 04:15.529
There's a man here to see you.
A man?

04:16.004 --> 04:18.767
Apparently, he has a proposition for you.

04:19.341 --> 04:20.341
Really?

04:23.885 --> 04:25.080
The name's Archer.

04:27.793 --> 04:30.359
Archer? Archer what?

04:31.929 --> 04:32.960
Just Archer.

04:33.403 --> 04:34.403
Archer.

04:35.572 --> 04:38.120
Weren't you due to hang in York?

04:38.281 --> 04:41.240
Me? Hang? York? Don't know anything about that.

04:41.553 --> 04:42.680
That's right.

04:43.325 --> 04:46.111
He's the one Hood and Gisborne broke out of prison.

04:46.231 --> 04:48.131
Many of my men were injured.

04:48.739 --> 04:51.720
I never asked them to do that. They just turned up.

04:52.396 --> 04:53.480
Arrest him.

04:53.641 --> 04:57.485
Robin Hood's a nut. He feels
compelled to go about saving people.

04:57.979 --> 04:59.420
Even so,

04:59.754 --> 05:03.320
do you really think I would fraternise
with such a low-life as you?

05:06.380 --> 05:09.352
You would if you knew the truth.
Wait.

05:09.685 --> 05:10.719
The truth?

05:14.506 --> 05:15.606
You and I...

05:18.692 --> 05:21.320
we're brother and sister.
I'm sorry?!

05:21.440 --> 05:23.428
Ghislaine is my mother too. Impossible.

05:23.548 --> 05:25.683
She had me out of wedlock and sent me away.

05:25.803 --> 05:28.953
How dare you stand there and tell me such evil lies?

05:29.287 --> 05:31.920
Is it a lie that she died in a house fire?

05:34.279 --> 05:36.679
Or that she was married to a leper...

05:37.910 --> 05:38.920
your father?

05:40.559 --> 05:41.960
Is that a lie?

05:42.476 --> 05:44.280
See, I've travelled far and wide.

05:46.272 --> 05:49.360
I know the most exotic ways to kill a man.

05:49.772 --> 05:51.600
That's why Robin and Gisborne saved me.

05:52.158 --> 05:55.560
They wanted to use me.
Take him away.

05:55.992 --> 05:57.720
If we join forces, think about it.

05:58.021 --> 06:00.080
Your power, my skill.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.160
We can be unstoppable.

06:03.705 --> 06:07.040
What I need are men that can offer me

06:07.201 --> 06:09.321
loyalty and protection.

06:10.153 --> 06:11.160
Arrest him!

06:11.932 --> 06:14.399
Sister, don't forsake me.

06:16.961 --> 06:19.007
Lock him up.
He must never be allowed

06:19.127 --> 06:20.627
to leave the castle.

06:21.163 --> 06:22.644
Ever!

06:47.164 --> 06:49.646
We have to get the rest of our supplies to Locksley.

06:49.766 --> 06:51.975
That'll keep the women and
children alive until we return

06:52.095 --> 06:54.495
their crops and livestock.
Robin?

06:55.204 --> 06:56.654
What about the men?

06:57.494 --> 06:59.840
What about them?
Well, when are they gonna fight?

07:00.785 --> 07:03.480
Tuck, these men are farmers. They're not warriors.

07:03.762 --> 07:06.240
The Lord helps those who help themselves, Robin.

07:06.766 --> 07:09.772
Your protection weakens them. We are failing in our mission.

07:09.892 --> 07:11.920
We're supposed to be inspiring these men to stand up

07:12.080 --> 07:14.503
and fight for themselves, giving them real hope.

07:14.623 --> 07:18.000
These men are terrified for their lives.
They've forgotten how to hope.

07:18.411 --> 07:21.861
Then, my friend, it's time we lit the flame in them again.

07:28.580 --> 07:32.360
If I disappoint the Prince, I hang like
every other noble who's ever failed him.

07:34.047 --> 07:36.640
Blamire, I need those men.
Tricky.

07:36.835 --> 07:38.840
Hood's protecting them in the forest.

07:39.270 --> 07:41.592
Then it's Hood I need to destroy.

07:42.033 --> 07:44.033
I need to get to his weakness,

07:45.117 --> 07:46.640
exploit his vulnerabilities.

07:47.039 --> 07:48.199
Which are?

07:52.680 --> 07:53.780
His friends,

07:55.016 --> 07:56.872
that odious little gang.

07:56.992 --> 07:59.560
The idiot cares about them. That's his weakness.

08:02.412 --> 08:03.412
Blamire...

08:05.712 --> 08:08.480
Bring me Kate's mother from Locksley.

08:16.072 --> 08:17.079
Hurry up!

08:19.783 --> 08:20.783
Move!

08:22.806 --> 08:24.088
This way.

08:32.265 --> 08:33.265
Good.

08:33.735 --> 08:35.760
Go, please, Blamire. This is delicate.

08:45.373 --> 08:46.973
It's pretty, isn't it?

08:48.136 --> 08:49.136
You know,

08:49.965 --> 08:53.609
sometimes the prettiest things can be the most fragile.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.199
Your daughter is an outlaw.

08:59.667 --> 09:01.643
My daughter is dead to me.

09:01.763 --> 09:04.719
There's no point denying her. Trust me on that.

09:08.113 --> 09:10.920
What do you want with me?
I want to help you.

09:11.700 --> 09:13.000
Help me?
Yes.

09:13.160 --> 09:15.600
A safe passage to Doncaster for you and your family.

09:17.195 --> 09:18.720
It must be awful for you,

09:18.881 --> 09:21.022
having a child living out there in the wild

09:21.142 --> 09:23.120
with those... savages.

09:23.761 --> 09:26.080
Well, Robin wouldn't hurt her.
Wouldn't he?

09:30.652 --> 09:32.320
He still loves me.

09:38.865 --> 09:41.669
She'll never leave him. She believes in him too much.

09:41.789 --> 09:44.400
Oh, well, then, we must shake her belief to the core.

09:44.958 --> 09:48.440
Plant this on Robin, then persuade
Kate that he still loves me,

09:49.193 --> 09:51.539
his own true Isabella.

09:52.140 --> 09:53.595
Then give her this.

09:54.275 --> 09:57.925
When she finds the other half on him, her faith will be shaken

09:58.300 --> 10:02.080
and she'll realise that a candle
still burns deeply in his heart for me.

10:05.995 --> 10:07.000
I can't.

10:09.179 --> 10:10.179
Can't?

10:11.369 --> 10:14.360
I don't think you understand, you ignorant crone.

10:15.520 --> 10:16.960
Every last morsel of food,

10:17.121 --> 10:21.080
every animal, every grain of
barley, within a 50-mile radius

10:21.630 --> 10:25.600
is locked up in my courtyard,
ready for transportation to the north.

10:25.998 --> 10:28.334
Hell is coming, Rebecca.

10:31.744 --> 10:34.240
I think you should save your family whilst you still can.

10:47.944 --> 10:49.794
This is everything we have.

10:51.306 --> 10:54.000
Love you.
I've got something to show you.

10:58.825 --> 11:01.359
Where did you get that?
Isabella.

11:04.099 --> 11:05.800
Robin holds the other half.

11:08.145 --> 11:09.295
Close to him.

11:11.372 --> 11:12.922
It seems there's a...

11:14.119 --> 11:16.201
a deep bond between them.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.500
I don't believe that.
He loves her.

11:21.723 --> 11:23.472
I'm sorry.
No.

11:25.438 --> 11:27.720
Isabella's Robin's enemy.
Check his things.

11:29.439 --> 11:32.160
If he holds the other half, then you'll know.

11:33.146 --> 11:34.680
I don't need to check his things.

11:34.841 --> 11:38.162
Kate, don't waste the rest of your life with him.

11:39.092 --> 11:41.280
Kate, you ready? We have to go.

11:42.308 --> 11:45.039
You belong here with us, with your family.

11:51.986 --> 11:52.999
Robin?

12:05.086 --> 12:06.640
Take good care of her.

12:06.801 --> 12:07.801
I will.

12:08.712 --> 12:10.000
I will. I promise.

12:12.493 --> 12:13.693
Come on, then.

12:20.172 --> 12:21.272
What's that?

12:25.720 --> 12:27.020
It's Isabella's.

12:27.798 --> 12:31.616
Our mother gave it to her when she
was a child. She worshipped her,

12:31.736 --> 12:33.555
and she cherished this.

12:37.239 --> 12:39.480
She wouldn't give this to just anyone, now, would she?

12:41.393 --> 12:43.143
So, what's it doing here?

12:43.997 --> 12:46.120
You think this is mine?
Well, she's your sister, Guy.

12:46.281 --> 12:48.925
Yeah, a sister that's betrayed me
many times, and tried to kill me.

12:49.045 --> 12:50.774
If there's any doubt about your loyalty...

12:50.894 --> 12:52.294
Well, there isn't.

12:52.974 --> 12:55.793
Would I have told you it was Isabella's if there was?

12:55.913 --> 12:58.640
Well, if it's not yours, then whose is it?

13:15.846 --> 13:18.567
You haven't moved from that spot in ten years.

13:18.687 --> 13:21.040
They let you out?
Not exactly.

13:21.782 --> 13:22.840
Need a drink?

13:24.218 --> 13:26.239
I need money, fast.

13:30.704 --> 13:33.560
I'm a wanted man. I need safe passage out of England.

13:33.926 --> 13:35.400
I need information I can sell.

13:37.127 --> 13:38.840
What sort of information?

13:39.001 --> 13:42.640
I need to prove my loyalty
to the Sheriff, show I can protect her.

13:44.772 --> 13:46.222
We take the castle.

13:49.273 --> 13:51.323
We claim it under King Richard.

13:52.812 --> 13:54.640
We put Isabella under house arrest.

13:55.985 --> 13:59.331
We release the supplies. We release the men.

14:00.691 --> 14:03.080
And we hold that castle till King Richard returns.

14:03.241 --> 14:05.241
If I can penetrate the castle,

14:05.804 --> 14:08.040
I open her eyes to what I'm capable of achieving.

14:08.558 --> 14:09.808
But the castle,

14:10.378 --> 14:12.843
it's bursting with men, crops, livestock.

14:12.963 --> 14:15.600
It's defended by an army of guards.

14:16.052 --> 14:18.920
We can't take a castle.
We can if we go down the tunnel.

14:21.125 --> 14:23.575
I'm tired of looking over my shoulder.

14:24.800 --> 14:28.000
I need enough so I can leave England... forever.

14:28.771 --> 14:29.771
Well...

14:30.801 --> 14:34.272
there is... one way in.

14:37.345 --> 14:39.920
When the old Sheriff returned from
his failed mission in the Holy Land,

14:40.040 --> 14:42.459
he became paranoid about repercussions.

14:42.579 --> 14:44.560
So he built himself an escape route.

14:45.676 --> 14:47.720
A tunnel.
Who dug this tunnel?

14:47.881 --> 14:51.360
Their rotting bodies were found underground.

14:51.806 --> 14:53.600
Gisborne locked them in,

14:54.222 --> 14:55.440
the whole force.

14:56.238 --> 14:59.495
The diggers were silenced. I made sure of that.

15:00.339 --> 15:03.440
So no one else knows about
the tunnel, especially not Isabella.

15:04.852 --> 15:07.602
It starts here, in a derelict
churchyard outside the west gate,

15:07.722 --> 15:10.320
and it leads directly into the heart of the castle.

15:11.713 --> 15:13.760
I say we go down the tunnel, we seize Isabella

15:13.921 --> 15:15.627
and we force her to dismiss her guards.

15:15.747 --> 15:18.000
We take Isabella, we take the castle.

15:24.059 --> 15:25.720
Now, that's everything I have.

15:26.512 --> 15:29.800
The opening is in a derelict churchyard,

15:30.699 --> 15:33.159
under the grave with the fallen cross.

15:41.165 --> 15:45.015
If we time the break-in to coincide
with the supply train leaving,

15:45.570 --> 15:48.520
most of the guards will be busy with the convoy anyway.

15:49.253 --> 15:50.681
Count me out.

15:51.366 --> 15:52.720
I don't trust him.

15:52.840 --> 15:55.960
How do we know that this isn't a trap?
Cos we want the same thing.

15:56.375 --> 15:58.360
Since when have you cared about our people?!

15:58.480 --> 16:00.160
I don't. I just want Isabella.

16:00.320 --> 16:02.400
She betrayed me to Prince
John. I intend to make her pay.

16:02.561 --> 16:05.360
Now, that sounds more like the
Gisborne we all know and loathe.

16:05.521 --> 16:08.000
That's enough! We go through the tunnel.

16:08.339 --> 16:10.089
And that's my final word!

16:11.326 --> 16:13.920
Gisborne is one of us now. Our fate is his.

16:14.579 --> 16:17.421
Tuck, John, get some forging tools to make weapons.

16:17.541 --> 16:19.480
The rest of you, get whatever money we have

16:19.641 --> 16:21.991
and melt it down to make arrowheads.

16:27.132 --> 16:29.188
Kate, listen.

16:31.772 --> 16:34.720
Gisborne's loyal. I'd stake my life on it.

16:34.946 --> 16:36.360
He killed my brother.

16:37.851 --> 16:39.880
I will never, never trust him.

16:40.557 --> 16:42.360
Well, you can trust me.
Can I?

16:42.900 --> 16:44.280
What? What do you mean?

16:45.083 --> 16:48.061
I've left my family. I'm not there with them.

16:48.732 --> 16:51.280
I'm here... with you.

16:51.543 --> 16:54.040
And you're helping, Kate. You're making a difference.

16:55.319 --> 16:57.520
Tell me you need me more than they do.

17:05.306 --> 17:07.480
I have to prepare for the raid.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.538
Now, I want you to issue this proclamation

18:34.658 --> 18:38.658
and I want you to make sure it is spoken
about in every corner of Nottingham,

18:39.311 --> 18:43.049
that due to his duties and loyalties to the Sheriff,

18:43.169 --> 18:46.399
the outlaw Allan A. Dale is
pardoned for all his wrongdoings.

18:46.519 --> 18:48.999
Allan A. Dale has...
Just do it.

18:55.872 --> 18:56.879
Trust me.

19:12.653 --> 19:14.428
Something funny, sis?

19:17.573 --> 19:21.573
How on earth did you get in here?
Call the guards you'll never find out.

19:22.298 --> 19:23.993
Speak.
The tunnel!

19:24.382 --> 19:25.920
It was an escape route for the old Sheriff.

19:26.159 --> 19:28.760
But what's far more interesting... is this.

19:30.271 --> 19:32.960
It was supervised by one Sir Guy of Gisborne.

19:34.057 --> 19:35.440
He and Hood are together now,

19:35.601 --> 19:38.225
and with all that stuff locked up in your courtyard,

19:38.345 --> 19:40.000
just waiting to be stolen,

19:40.274 --> 19:42.960
how long do you think it'll take
before they come in the same way I did?

19:43.080 --> 19:46.479
I'll get the guards and wait. I could
ambush them as soon as they emerge.

19:46.599 --> 19:48.680
Guards are useless. I've seen what they do to guards.

19:48.800 --> 19:52.000
You need something a little more sophisticated than guards.

19:52.632 --> 19:55.040
Something they're not expecting.
Keep talking.

19:56.329 --> 19:57.329
Well...

19:59.132 --> 20:02.000
for a few pennies, I can trap the tunnel.

20:02.426 --> 20:04.495
It does happen to be one of my specialities.

20:04.615 --> 20:06.473
If you can make sure that they both die

20:06.593 --> 20:09.080
a slow and very painful death,

20:09.240 --> 20:11.200
I'll give you more than pennies,

20:11.666 --> 20:12.679
brother.

20:24.179 --> 20:27.179
They've taken everything, even the forging tools.

20:27.739 --> 20:30.760
This is a proclamation from the Sheriff of Nottingham.

20:30.880 --> 20:33.520
Let it be known that, for services to the Sheriff,

20:33.680 --> 20:35.566
the outlaw Allan A. Dale

20:35.686 --> 20:38.760
has been given immunity from prosecution.

20:40.100 --> 20:41.479
He is a free man.

20:46.646 --> 20:48.421
John! John!

20:53.952 --> 20:56.320
All of this needs to be made into arrowheads.

20:57.252 --> 20:59.640
Robin?
We're running out of time.

21:00.148 --> 21:01.160
Robin?

21:01.321 --> 21:03.047
Where's Tuck and John with those tools?

21:03.167 --> 21:04.676
She's gone! Kate.

21:08.480 --> 21:09.880
You say something?

21:10.772 --> 21:12.840
Why is it always my fault?
I'm gonna find her.

21:13.179 --> 21:15.400
Much, Kate can look after herself.

21:15.561 --> 21:17.774
She's got a family to protect, we've got a castle to take.

21:17.894 --> 21:18.894
I know.

21:20.219 --> 21:22.760
What?
Traitor! What did you tell them?

21:23.052 --> 21:25.402
Judas!
It's all over Nottingham.

21:26.026 --> 21:28.720
Allan's been pardoned by the Sheriff for services rendered.

21:29.079 --> 21:31.560
What?! John, let him go.
Let me speak!

21:31.680 --> 21:34.755
Oh, yeah, you're good at that,
aren't you? Speaking and lying?!

21:34.875 --> 21:37.280
Twisting us round your little finger!
John! Come on!

21:37.441 --> 21:39.120
Let him go. Come on.

21:39.756 --> 21:40.758
Liar!

21:42.806 --> 21:45.306
All right?
I haven't done anything!

21:46.917 --> 21:49.067
I swear! I haven't betrayed you.

21:51.268 --> 21:52.268
Much!

21:57.205 --> 21:58.705
You believe me, Guy.

22:03.746 --> 22:04.559
Tuck?

22:10.392 --> 22:11.279
Robin?

22:14.598 --> 22:17.880
So, you think I'm a coward? Is that it? Yeah?

22:18.405 --> 22:21.800
What - that I've sold you out
to save myself somehow, yeah?

22:23.485 --> 22:25.960
You've done that before.
I know!

22:26.342 --> 22:28.200
And every day, I wish I could take that back.

22:28.361 --> 22:29.561
You know that!

22:34.923 --> 22:36.120
None of you?

22:38.686 --> 22:40.461
None of you believe me?

22:41.246 --> 22:42.646
I'll be off, then.

22:43.856 --> 22:46.939
No. Did you tell her about the tunnel?

22:47.222 --> 22:49.251
I told you, I haven't said...
Tie him up!

22:49.371 --> 22:51.400
What? No, no, no, no.

22:51.712 --> 22:53.400
I can't take the risk.
Robin!

22:53.560 --> 22:56.760
Once we've secured the castle, we will
come back and we will sort this out.

23:00.990 --> 23:03.390
John, don't do this.
Get it done!

23:04.506 --> 23:06.359
Don't even look at me!

23:17.059 --> 23:18.059
Stay here.

23:25.980 --> 23:27.480
Specialist, you say?

23:28.124 --> 23:29.520
For your sake, you'd better be.

23:30.106 --> 23:32.556
You'll get your money's worth, sister.

23:32.676 --> 23:33.960
As long as I get mine.

23:34.121 --> 23:37.800
You'll get paid on one condition. That this trap kills Hood.

23:38.692 --> 23:40.039
You're the boss.

23:47.265 --> 23:50.920
We get into the castle, we capture
Isabella, release the villagers.

23:52.073 --> 23:54.168
But if the convoy leaves, then we've failed.

23:54.288 --> 23:57.320
And Tuck, John, it's up to you
to stop it, no matter what.

24:01.146 --> 24:03.996
This could be the last time we see each other.

24:12.660 --> 24:13.810
Best of luck.

24:16.066 --> 24:17.066
It's time.

24:32.212 --> 24:35.762
Put my neck on the block, time
and time again, and for what?

24:37.033 --> 24:38.033
Nothing.

24:42.104 --> 24:45.880
Those of you who can fight, must
help us intercept the supply train.

24:48.545 --> 24:51.095
Those are your crops inside that castle.

24:52.073 --> 24:53.080
Your livestock,

24:53.759 --> 24:56.640
your brothers. Damn it, men,
it's time to stand up and fight!

24:57.300 --> 24:59.889
Take back what's rightfully yours!
Brother Tuck?

25:00.009 --> 25:02.092
They're being trodden on, John, and they're taking it.

25:02.212 --> 25:04.668
If they would only stand together,
they can defeat the Sheriff.

25:04.788 --> 25:07.400
Defeating the Sheriff is our job, Tuck...

25:08.166 --> 25:10.600
even if... it is the last thing

25:11.156 --> 25:12.704
we ever do.

25:19.707 --> 25:20.707
Robin?

25:21.754 --> 25:22.804
This is it.

25:39.378 --> 25:40.920
You shouldn't mess with graves.

26:02.099 --> 26:04.699
Hood and his men have entered the tunnel.

26:05.773 --> 26:06.773
Good.

26:09.153 --> 26:10.160
Thank you.

26:15.727 --> 26:17.240
This should buy your disappearance.

26:17.559 --> 26:20.080
Is this everything I asked for?
Count it.

26:21.671 --> 26:23.120
I believe you.
Good.

26:23.446 --> 26:25.246
Then you can believe this.

26:25.555 --> 26:29.080
If I ever smell your fetid odour
anywhere near Nottingham again,

26:29.371 --> 26:33.362
I will have you dipped in blood
and torn apart by starving dogs.

26:34.566 --> 26:36.166
My mother was a saint.

26:36.865 --> 26:40.080
The fact that she could have had
a child out of wedlock is bad enough.

26:40.445 --> 26:43.279
But some nasty little hustler like you...

26:46.906 --> 26:47.956
Be assured,

26:49.149 --> 26:51.398
I will kill a thousand times

26:51.518 --> 26:54.000
to keep my mother's sacred memory pure.

26:56.317 --> 26:57.438
Don't worry.

26:57.558 --> 26:59.600
I've got plans far away from here.

27:02.241 --> 27:04.120
You'll never see me again.

27:09.396 --> 27:10.396
Kate!

27:13.472 --> 27:16.400
What's happened?
I found the locket.

27:17.383 --> 27:19.583
You were right. He loves Isabella.

27:19.703 --> 27:22.403
He must do, otherwise why would he have it?

27:22.859 --> 27:24.240
I'll gather everyone together.

27:29.586 --> 27:31.236
Come on, Kate. Come on.

27:34.733 --> 27:36.733
This is the right thing to do.

27:38.694 --> 27:40.887
I know.
Your brother was stupid enough

27:41.007 --> 27:43.120
to get himself killed for Robin's ridiculous cause.

27:43.281 --> 27:45.440
At least you have the good sense to run away while you...

27:45.601 --> 27:47.151
I'm not running away.

27:47.999 --> 27:49.960
But if he is in league with her,

27:50.272 --> 27:52.440
then I don't understand anything any more.

27:53.899 --> 27:55.767
I thought I loved him.

28:00.078 --> 28:01.078
Oh, Kate.

28:04.006 --> 28:06.040
I didn't know I could love someone like that.

28:07.086 --> 28:08.982
Kate, I'm so sorry.

28:09.863 --> 28:11.363
It's not your fault.

28:11.952 --> 28:13.640
No, no, you don't understand.

28:13.959 --> 28:15.859
I was trying to protect you.

28:17.813 --> 28:20.720
I had to do it.
Had to do what?

28:22.273 --> 28:23.273
Tell me!

28:24.302 --> 28:26.280
Robin doesn't love Isabella.

28:26.651 --> 28:29.480
It was me. I put the locket into his bag for you to find.

28:30.188 --> 28:32.188
You were supposed to leave him

28:32.377 --> 28:34.760
and then we could get away from here, to have a new life.

28:57.094 --> 29:00.120
We're under the castle. Much, keep moving. Come on!

29:04.985 --> 29:05.999
Oh, no!

29:12.761 --> 29:13.761
No!

29:22.279 --> 29:24.079
I knew it would be a trap!

29:24.425 --> 29:25.439
Much...

29:26.641 --> 29:27.720
let me think.

29:28.841 --> 29:30.885
You give 'em the best years of your life,

29:31.005 --> 29:32.205
and for what?!

29:38.810 --> 29:39.810
No.

29:43.773 --> 29:44.873
It can't be.

30:07.028 --> 30:08.778
I've got to get to Robin.

30:17.513 --> 30:18.680
Nearly time.

30:20.167 --> 30:21.717
It's quiet, isn't it?

30:22.973 --> 30:23.800
Calm.

30:24.722 --> 30:26.324
It's like when you're hunting.

30:26.444 --> 30:29.694
The moment you spot your prey, your stag, there's a...

30:30.593 --> 30:31.600
stillness.

30:32.018 --> 30:35.440
Just for a moment, you wonder
whether you can go through with it,

30:35.786 --> 30:38.040
whether you can slaughter this beast with...

30:38.976 --> 30:39.976
so much...

30:41.833 --> 30:42.839
Dignity?

30:44.818 --> 30:47.039
Yeah. Dignity.

30:53.533 --> 30:54.533
John!

31:08.339 --> 31:11.280
They're brave, but they can't fight.
Look at them. It'll be a massacre.

31:11.400 --> 31:14.400
They're not going to fight, John.
What?

31:16.682 --> 31:20.136
Gentlemen, these gates will open soon.

31:21.432 --> 31:25.303
Now, it is our task to stop the supply train in its tracks.

31:26.511 --> 31:29.000
And that is exactly what we're going to do.

31:31.234 --> 31:35.200
As an army, as a militia, we would be crushed.

31:36.553 --> 31:39.040
The Sheriff's men would hack us down like weeds.

31:40.805 --> 31:43.480
But it's harder to cut the spirit with a blade.

31:45.161 --> 31:48.824
When these gates open and the supply train pulls out,

31:48.944 --> 31:51.000
we are going to sit down.

31:52.053 --> 31:54.320
Just sit... in silence.

31:55.252 --> 31:58.252
My friends, we are going to turn the other cheek.

31:59.326 --> 32:03.026
They will be... we will be crushed.
Dignity, John. Dignity!

32:03.513 --> 32:06.600
Even when everything has been
taken from us, we still have that.

32:06.720 --> 32:09.782
And the Sheriff's men will be faced with a choice -

32:09.902 --> 32:12.280
stand aside or carry out a massacre.

32:12.621 --> 32:16.243
Yeah, these are the Sheriff's men. I think
we know what choice they're gonna make.

32:16.363 --> 32:19.963
They may be soldiers, John, but they are still men. Just men.

32:20.644 --> 32:22.960
And faced with the power of truth, a man can change.

32:23.412 --> 32:25.800
If we all stand together, we can have that power.

32:27.459 --> 32:29.159
We can be unstoppable.

32:32.616 --> 32:33.720
So Allan's told her.

32:34.550 --> 32:35.558
Or him.

32:35.678 --> 32:37.968
I knew we shouldn't have trusted you.
If I knew this was a trap,

32:38.088 --> 32:39.600
do you think I'd be stuck in here as well?

32:39.720 --> 32:41.880
That's enough, the both of you.

32:44.013 --> 32:45.320
What is that?

32:52.887 --> 32:54.337
There's no way out.

32:55.193 --> 32:57.243
There's always a way out, Much.

32:58.721 --> 33:01.920
So, this is how it ends. This is how we die.

33:02.689 --> 33:04.189
Buried in limestone.

33:04.886 --> 33:06.080
Hardly fair, is it?

33:06.241 --> 33:09.600
If one of us can reach the top, we can hold out longer.

33:10.646 --> 33:12.635
Much, come here. Gisborne, get on our shoulders.

33:12.755 --> 33:14.800
No! It's gotta be you, Robin.

33:15.487 --> 33:18.240
You're the one who has to live. It has to be you.

33:18.850 --> 33:21.050
All right, come on. Let's do this.

33:22.719 --> 33:24.428
Ready? Ready, go!

33:43.179 --> 33:44.367
Allan?

33:58.336 --> 33:59.336
You.

34:01.219 --> 34:02.769
Raise the portcullis!

34:03.275 --> 34:04.275
Move out!

34:07.859 --> 34:09.109
Open the gates!

34:40.159 --> 34:42.320
You, there, move out of the road!

34:51.212 --> 34:53.599
Move out of the road, I said,

34:54.188 --> 34:56.760
or prepare to die where you sit.

35:03.992 --> 35:06.501
Men, draw your swords.

35:10.812 --> 35:13.482
I said draw your swords.

35:13.722 --> 35:15.022
Now!

35:20.161 --> 35:22.160
Don't worry. I won't let you die!

35:23.073 --> 35:24.080
I'm sinking!

35:29.113 --> 35:30.520
I'm going under!

35:31.327 --> 35:33.504
Give me your...
Robin!

35:36.253 --> 35:37.253
Much!

35:38.215 --> 35:39.415
Stay together.

35:40.149 --> 35:42.800
Much, if you stay together, you
can breathe for a little while longer.

35:43.272 --> 35:46.160
And keep your hands moving, so I know.

35:48.825 --> 35:49.825
Much!

35:53.317 --> 35:54.317
Much!

35:59.918 --> 36:00.920
Much!

36:31.940 --> 36:33.715
Get out of the way!

36:43.554 --> 36:44.800
Cut them down!

36:49.619 --> 36:51.119
Start with me, then!

37:01.120 --> 37:02.120
Go on.

37:02.526 --> 37:04.400
Be a man! Start with me!

37:05.080 --> 37:06.230
Do it or die.

37:06.963 --> 37:08.280
And kill an innocent girl.

37:45.281 --> 37:46.481
Tuck, come on!

37:48.659 --> 37:50.129
Let's go!

38:02.913 --> 38:05.800
We need to save Robin.
What? Come on!

38:15.619 --> 38:18.120
We've got to get that rope, Kate.
What's in there?

38:20.472 --> 38:22.074
I've got it!
Then pull!

38:22.194 --> 38:23.408
I'm pulling!

38:33.779 --> 38:36.040
Oh, Robin! No, no, no, no, no. Come on.

38:36.201 --> 38:38.281
Come on, come on, come on.

38:39.580 --> 38:42.200
Come on, come on! I need you! Breathe!

38:53.972 --> 38:56.880
I thought I'd lost you.
I thought I'd lost you.

38:58.627 --> 39:01.600
My mother planted that locket.
I should never have doubted you.

39:01.972 --> 39:04.255
Isabella was trying to rip us apart.

39:04.375 --> 39:06.920
Well, that means Allan's innocent.
Allan?

39:07.579 --> 39:09.680
She's been playing with us all along.

39:15.193 --> 39:17.400
We need to find Isabella. Now!

39:17.852 --> 39:20.520
The entrance to the castle's blocked. Follow me.

39:25.852 --> 39:28.496
The peasants are trying to get into the castle.

39:28.616 --> 39:30.960
You have to protect me.
Can't help.

39:32.713 --> 39:33.713
Sorry.

39:34.280 --> 39:36.080
They're going to tear me to pieces.

39:36.241 --> 39:37.360
Not my problem.

39:38.046 --> 39:41.596
I've got to be somewhere else.
I just gave you an order!

39:41.970 --> 39:44.800
You have no idea what's happening here, do you?

39:44.961 --> 39:45.961
What?

39:46.322 --> 39:49.872
You can't just leave me here to be massacred by this rabble.

39:52.165 --> 39:55.240
Please! For pity's sake, help me.

39:55.659 --> 39:58.209
If you want to save yourself, hear this.

39:58.716 --> 40:00.440
Deliver Gisborne to the tunnel.

40:01.172 --> 40:04.040
That doesn't make any sense. Gisborne is dead.

40:05.492 --> 40:08.055
Goodbye, Sheriff, and good luck.

40:11.120 --> 40:12.120
Blamire!

40:15.866 --> 40:17.920
You forced my mother to lie to me.

40:18.219 --> 40:19.840
You tried to poison me against Robin.

40:20.185 --> 40:22.840
So, what of it? You don't belong together.

40:23.953 --> 40:25.689
An ill-raised peasant?

40:25.809 --> 40:28.400
Hardly a worthy companion for a man of noble birth.

40:43.979 --> 40:45.579
Don't come any closer.

40:52.026 --> 40:53.600
I believe this is yours.

40:54.786 --> 40:57.175
It's over, Isabella.

41:01.520 --> 41:03.200
In the name of King Richard,

41:04.691 --> 41:07.840
I charge Isabella of Gisborne with high treason

41:08.406 --> 41:10.560
and crimes against the people of Nottingham.

41:11.112 --> 41:13.240
The castle and everything in it

41:13.626 --> 41:15.440
belongs to the people!

41:25.561 --> 41:26.791
Robin!

41:32.410 --> 41:33.758
Move. Move!

42:23.638 --> 42:24.938
Close the gates.

42:33.479 --> 42:35.174
Man the battlements!

42:39.583 --> 42:40.583
Move!

42:48.326 --> 42:49.326
Come on!

42:52.260 --> 42:53.260
My lord.

42:53.957 --> 42:57.160
Blamire, you old tomcat. How the devil are you?

42:57.626 --> 42:59.400
The plan is in place.

43:00.153 --> 43:01.153
Good.

43:04.819 --> 43:06.769
Oh, this will be so much fun.

43:08.601 --> 43:09.601
Come on!

43:10.763 --> 43:11.763
Robin!

43:13.164 --> 43:14.164
Robin!

43:23.161 --> 43:25.199
We will have our reckoning.

43:25.361 --> 43:27.840
Right now, I want my town back!

43:28.719 --> 43:31.720
I want every able-bodied man armed and ready.

43:32.273 --> 43:34.040
All Nottingham, for the King!

43:35.720 --> 43:38.680
You so want to kill me, don't you?

43:39.225 --> 43:40.840
We attack immediately!

43:42.680 --> 43:44.600
Abandon the battlements!

43:44.879 --> 43:46.640
Destroy everything!

43:48.158 --> 43:51.160
Together, for England!
