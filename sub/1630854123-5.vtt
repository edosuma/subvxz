WEBVTT

00:04.472 --> 00:05.773
<i>Eva won her big race.</i>

00:05.839 --> 00:07.608
<i>She can't wait
to show you her medal.</i>

00:07.675 --> 00:09.277
<i>And Bella made you
some brownies.</i>

00:09.343 --> 00:12.380
Right.
Well, GPS says 26 minutes.

00:12.446 --> 00:14.648
<i>The girls are so excited.</i>

00:14.715 --> 00:16.184
Good.

00:16.250 --> 00:17.585
Man, I am too.

00:17.651 --> 00:20.154
<i>They can't wait
for you to get home.</i>

00:20.221 --> 00:23.191
<i>Oh, and we're all packed
for the beach.</i>

00:23.257 --> 00:26.927
It's been a crazy week.

00:26.994 --> 00:28.929
I'll be seeing you soon.

00:28.996 --> 00:30.264
Love you.

00:30.331 --> 00:32.133
<i>Love you too.</i>

01:09.803 --> 01:11.505
It's a little
hard to tell now,

01:11.572 --> 01:15.042
but our vic is Frank Leone,
58, out of Forest Hills.

01:15.109 --> 01:16.944
Forest Hills.
That's a nice address.

01:17.010 --> 01:19.380
My dad used to drive us around
pointing at all the big houses

01:19.447 --> 01:20.681
giving us the someday speech.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.916
The American dream.

01:22.983 --> 01:25.686
Guess this is the flipside
of all that aspiration.

01:25.753 --> 01:29.290
That's $30,000 hanging
off of a dead man's wrist.

01:29.357 --> 01:31.058
Means the shooter
only wanted one thing.

01:31.125 --> 01:32.726
Make sure he was dead.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.195
Between the bling
and the two shooters,

01:34.262 --> 01:36.029
we figured it's a hit.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.399
So the boss says let's put some
federal tax dollars to work.

01:38.466 --> 01:40.734
Okay.
We appreciate the heads up.

01:43.837 --> 01:46.174
These are assault
shotgun rounds.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.508
Heavy duty stuff.

01:47.575 --> 01:49.743
We used them in Mosul
for close quarters work.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.179
Work?

01:51.245 --> 01:53.581
Work.

01:53.647 --> 01:54.882
Let's go ahead
and bag up the shells.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.384
See if we can dig out any slugs

01:56.450 --> 01:58.586
and pull for prints or DNA.

01:58.652 --> 02:01.155
And let's dust
and scrub this door.

02:01.222 --> 02:03.557
Shooter had to get in pretty
close for this final headshot.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.659
Maybe we'll get lucky
with some prints.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.094
There any cameras
in the area?

02:07.161 --> 02:10.164
One by the entrance
of the paper plant, broken.

02:11.732 --> 02:13.567
- That's our only witness?
- Yep.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.002
He says there were
six or seven others,

02:15.068 --> 02:16.504
but they just skedaddled.

02:16.570 --> 02:18.038
They know something we don't?

02:18.105 --> 02:20.174
In this neighborhood,
snitches get stitches.

02:20.241 --> 02:21.742
That one's a newcomer.

02:21.809 --> 02:24.712
He gave me the whole
defund the police rant.

02:24.778 --> 02:26.514
So I'm rolling
around the corner.

02:26.580 --> 02:27.915
And first, I'm thinking like,

02:27.981 --> 02:30.951
"This has to be, like,
a movie set or something."

02:31.018 --> 02:33.954
But then I'm realizing, there's
no crew, there's no camera,

02:34.021 --> 02:35.723
so then it hits me,
it's like, "Oh, wow.

02:35.789 --> 02:37.525
This is like that real-deal
New York stuff."

02:37.591 --> 02:39.860
Right.
So you said two shooters?

02:39.927 --> 02:45.333
Driver was 6'2"-ish,
passenger was 5'6"-ish?

02:45.399 --> 02:46.600
Correct.

02:46.667 --> 02:47.935
The two shooters
were wearing masks.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.538
Did you see their hands?
Maybe notice what race?

02:50.604 --> 02:52.606
Mm, tall dude was white.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.942
And the other maybe brown-ish?

02:55.008 --> 02:57.278
Speaking of which, if you cops
were nicer to people of color,

02:57.345 --> 03:00.080
you might have a little
more help around here.

03:00.147 --> 03:02.550
We are not cops.
But thank you for that tip.

03:02.616 --> 03:04.352
We will do just that.

03:04.418 --> 03:07.054
<i>Anything else?
Anything at all stand out?</i>

03:07.120 --> 03:09.156
The one who fired
the pistol was a lefty.

03:09.223 --> 03:11.191
Okay, good.

03:11.259 --> 03:13.093
The van, did you catch a plate?

03:13.160 --> 03:15.128
Maybe notice any other
details about the vehicle?

03:15.195 --> 03:17.465
One of the hubcaps
was missing, like,

03:17.531 --> 03:18.599
the thing in the middle,

03:18.666 --> 03:20.968
the little, like,
emblem thingy.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.936
Uh, passenger side, front tire.

03:23.003 --> 03:24.638
You don't miss much, do you?

03:24.705 --> 03:26.340
I'm an artist.

03:26.407 --> 03:27.441
Details are my life.

03:27.508 --> 03:29.277
Ours too.

03:29.343 --> 03:31.612
Thanks.

03:31.679 --> 03:33.281
The killers went right
on Broadway.

03:33.347 --> 03:34.482
Okay.

03:34.548 --> 03:35.883
Let's work our way out
from there.

03:35.949 --> 03:38.586
All right, so our two perps
escaped in a what?

03:38.652 --> 03:40.754
- Black Ford van. Morning.
- Yeah.

03:40.821 --> 03:43.524
This is bodega footage two
blocks from the crime scene.

03:43.591 --> 03:45.326
Front wheel does match
the witness description.

03:45.393 --> 03:48.696
We were able to track them
for a dozen blocks or so,

03:48.762 --> 03:49.930
then we lose them.

03:49.997 --> 03:51.432
Get any quality shots
of the perps?

03:51.499 --> 03:52.966
Uh, there's not enough
for facial rec,

03:53.033 --> 03:55.603
but the biometrics can
confirm heights on both

03:55.669 --> 03:57.037
the driver and the passenger.

03:57.104 --> 03:59.707
Based on make and model,
driver is 6'1",

03:59.773 --> 04:02.376
and riding literal shotgun
is a 5'7" individual.

04:02.443 --> 04:04.845
Okay, so that all jibes
with the eyewitness statement,

04:04.912 --> 04:07.114
plus the passenger is smoking
with his left hand.

04:07.180 --> 04:08.349
It looks like they obscured
the license plate, yeah?

04:08.416 --> 04:09.683
That's correct.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.151
All right, let's put
a BOLO out on the van

04:11.218 --> 04:14.722
and let's flip to our victim,
Mr. Frank Leone.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.690
So who was he?
Why was he killed?

04:16.757 --> 04:18.158
Hobbs, talk to me.
What do we know?

04:18.225 --> 04:20.628
He was an accountant,
25 years at Ernst and Young.

04:20.694 --> 04:23.230
Went on his own five years ago,
and look at this:

04:23.297 --> 04:25.265
he was liquidating his assets
a week ago,

04:25.333 --> 04:27.167
moving everything into cash.

04:27.234 --> 04:28.602
And so was his wife.

04:28.669 --> 04:31.339
Well, maybe they're
bearish on the stock market.

04:31.405 --> 04:32.806
Or something else.

04:32.873 --> 04:36.444
Ivy League, MBA, Lions Club.

04:36.510 --> 04:38.612
Let's be honest, solid citizens

04:38.679 --> 04:40.080
don't get rubbed out
on city streets.

04:40.147 --> 04:41.449
We need more.

04:41.515 --> 04:43.517
Does he have any enemies,
any debts he won't pay?

04:43.584 --> 04:46.219
I mean, this could be anything,
a love triangle gone bad.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.055
Don't make me use
my imagination, folks.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.189
I need facts.

04:49.256 --> 04:50.958
Has anyone
contacted the widow?

04:51.024 --> 04:52.960
Uh, yeah, OA and Nina
just landed in Forest Hills.

04:53.026 --> 04:55.295
So hopefully Mrs. Leone
can enlighten us.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.633
I don't know.

04:59.700 --> 05:02.536
Really. He never says much.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.638
Said much.

05:04.705 --> 05:08.576
I mean, he works,
and I do the kids.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.878
So I can't really help much.
I just--I can't.

05:10.944 --> 05:13.514
But Miss Leone, your husband
was murdered today.

05:13.581 --> 05:16.283
And you're being a bit
evasive with us.

05:16.350 --> 05:18.185
Was there something going on
between the two of you?

05:18.251 --> 05:20.053
Did he have somebody else?
Did you--

05:20.120 --> 05:22.890
What? Me? Us?
No, nothing like that.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.825
Well, we know that
you sold your house recently

05:24.892 --> 05:26.760
and that you've been
transferring lots of cash

05:26.827 --> 05:28.028
to your various
different bank accounts.

05:28.095 --> 05:30.598
What, with this market,
we need a reason

05:30.664 --> 05:32.132
to make a move towards cash?

05:32.199 --> 05:33.166
Is that a crime?

05:35.135 --> 05:36.103
Hawaii?

05:36.169 --> 05:37.805
Yes.

05:37.871 --> 05:40.608
For our tenth, we swam
with the dolphins.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.175
It's a beautiful family.

05:42.242 --> 05:44.612
Thank you.
He loves his girls.

05:44.678 --> 05:48.048
We think that this was a
targeted shooting, Miss Leone.

05:48.115 --> 05:49.750
So anything that
you can tell us

05:49.817 --> 05:52.119
about his personal life
or his work life,

05:52.185 --> 05:54.422
all of it would be really,
really helpful.

05:54.488 --> 05:56.757
I honestly don't know.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.826
He had only one client.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.928
He would allude to stuff
about his client

06:00.994 --> 06:02.496
but never spell anything out.

06:02.563 --> 06:04.297
Never even told me his name.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.399
What kind of stuff?

06:10.170 --> 06:12.005
If you are scared, Miss Leone,
that's okay

06:12.072 --> 06:13.607
'cause we can protect you
and we can protect them.

06:13.674 --> 06:14.942
But you're gonna
have to help us here,

06:15.008 --> 06:17.244
and you're gonna have
to do that right now.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.048
It might have been,
and I swear

06:21.114 --> 06:24.552
that I am guessing, drugs.

06:24.618 --> 06:27.588
Frank said he was not doing
anything illegal himself,

06:27.655 --> 06:31.725
and he had this five-year plan,
and then we'd be set for life.

06:31.792 --> 06:35.796
And that's why
we were cashing in.

06:35.863 --> 06:39.166
There's gonna be some really
rough times ahead

06:39.232 --> 06:41.101
for you, for them.

06:41.168 --> 06:42.536
So knowing who
did this and why,

06:42.603 --> 06:45.506
that's gonna be
really important,

06:45.573 --> 06:46.740
especially for the girls.

06:55.449 --> 06:56.416
Hold on.

07:14.034 --> 07:18.105
He told me if anything happens,
this has everything.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.980
All right, we figured out
who the mystery client is

07:27.047 --> 07:29.049
and if he in fact
killed his money man?

07:29.116 --> 07:30.918
Well, Leone's only client
is more like

07:30.984 --> 07:32.486
a one-man conglomerate.

07:32.553 --> 07:35.856
There are over 30 LLCs,
all set up offshore.

07:35.923 --> 07:38.025
Caymans, Belize, Isle of Man.

07:38.091 --> 07:39.893
Kind of instruments designed
to move and launder

07:39.960 --> 07:41.562
lots of cash without a trace.

07:41.629 --> 07:44.297
So I'm cross-referencing
any of the accounts

07:44.364 --> 07:45.933
with all the
brick-and-mortar overlays,

07:45.999 --> 07:48.702
and there's at least a dozen
buildings in Toronto

07:48.769 --> 07:51.505
owned by a single trust
assigned to one of the LLCs,

07:51.572 --> 07:56.176
and a Maria Rincon is listed
as president of that trust.

07:56.243 --> 07:59.613
And she happens to be the
wife of Antonio Rincon.

07:59.680 --> 08:05.152
Who is, wow, a major player.

08:05.218 --> 08:07.020
Did some state time
for distribution,

08:07.087 --> 08:08.989
had several arrests
for homicide

08:09.056 --> 08:10.991
but strangely, no convictions.

08:11.058 --> 08:13.527
Deep into narcotics,
runs high level robbery crews,

08:13.594 --> 08:17.965
and sine qua non for gangsters
everywhere, murder for hire.

08:18.031 --> 08:20.100
Widely known as El Feo.

08:20.167 --> 08:23.136
All right, so our victim
was working for this El Feo,

08:23.203 --> 08:25.505
an old school gangster
in a brave new world,

08:25.573 --> 08:29.376
which means Client One
just became Target One.

08:29.442 --> 08:32.112
Lookie here,
he's been tagged by the DOJ.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.748
A secret grand jury
was convened

08:34.815 --> 08:37.084
three months ago
to go after him.

08:37.150 --> 08:39.653
Was Leone also a target
of the investigation?

08:39.720 --> 08:41.589
I can't tell. It's weird.

08:41.655 --> 08:44.191
Most of this is redacted.

08:44.257 --> 08:46.259
Leone may have
been testifying.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.564
All right, I'll go talk
to the U.S. Attorney.

08:53.934 --> 08:57.370
All I can say for sure,
our case died with Leone.

08:57.437 --> 09:00.007
- Did he flip on El Feo?
- Gave us everything.

09:00.073 --> 09:02.676
But more importantly,
he was willing to testify.

09:02.743 --> 09:05.445
We were less than a week away
from indicting that prick.

09:05.512 --> 09:08.582
And somehow El Feo
found out about the betrayal.

09:08.649 --> 09:09.883
I'm not sure.

09:09.950 --> 09:11.619
This jury was
locked super tight.

09:11.685 --> 09:12.953
Strictly need to know.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.655
Only prosecutors
and the jurors.

09:14.722 --> 09:16.023
Leone didn't even
have a lawyer,

09:16.089 --> 09:18.258
and I know for a fact
he never told his wife.

09:18.325 --> 09:19.660
All right.

09:19.727 --> 09:21.394
First thing, I need a list
of those grand jurors.

09:21.461 --> 09:24.865
We need to find that leak.
- Done.

09:24.932 --> 09:27.500
You know, Izzy,
Leone was a good guy,

09:27.567 --> 09:29.169
just got himself stuck
at the intersection

09:29.236 --> 09:31.038
of greed and stupidity.

09:35.242 --> 09:36.576
All right, folks,
any of our esteemed jurors

09:36.644 --> 09:38.646
have any connections
to El Feo, to his gang,

09:38.712 --> 09:40.213
to any known associates?

09:40.280 --> 09:43.116
Any of those jurors have
any irregular influxes of cash?

09:43.183 --> 09:44.584
Any major purchases?

09:44.652 --> 09:47.587
Well, we got everyone
from a tech startup CEO

09:47.655 --> 09:49.589
to a USPS letter carrier,

09:49.657 --> 09:52.960
but there's only one juror
so far that jumps out,

09:53.026 --> 09:54.962
a Mrs. Saunders.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.764
Margaret Saunders.

09:56.830 --> 09:59.667
On a medical assistant salary,
she made two deposits

09:59.733 --> 10:02.069
over the past week of $9,000.

10:02.135 --> 10:04.805
That's conveniently under
the federal reporting trigger.

10:04.872 --> 10:08.876
Well, she hit it big at the
slots or Saturday night bingo?

10:08.942 --> 10:10.610
Or maybe she's El Feo's source.

10:10.678 --> 10:12.680
If that is the case,
how would she and El Feo

10:12.746 --> 10:14.047
have found each other?

10:14.114 --> 10:16.216
She's a middle class mom.
He's a depraved killer.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.517
I think I have something.

10:17.584 --> 10:19.486
She works for a dermatologist
in Midtown.

10:19.552 --> 10:20.888
Yeah.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.222
El Feo is a patient there.

10:22.289 --> 10:25.025
All right, there it is.
Guilt by association.

10:25.092 --> 10:26.960
It's like I always say,
never trust

10:27.027 --> 10:28.729
your dermatologist's assistant.

10:28.796 --> 10:31.198
So how do we find this
Mrs. Margaret Saunders?

10:31.264 --> 10:34.101
She's in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.636
All right, Tiffany
and Scola are closest.

10:36.704 --> 10:39.740
Let's go ask her
about this sudden windfall.

10:47.981 --> 10:51.151
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Saunders?

11:06.166 --> 11:08.301
Miss Saunders?

11:12.840 --> 11:14.708
Miss Saunders?

11:34.862 --> 11:38.331
So they did the husband quick
and the wife slow?

11:38.398 --> 11:40.067
They wanted to know
if she told anyone about

11:40.133 --> 11:42.002
her side hustle with El Feo.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.283
Hey.
Ballistics are a match.

11:56.349 --> 11:58.085
The kill shot on Leone
is from the same gun

11:58.151 --> 11:59.419
that killed the Saunders.

11:59.486 --> 12:01.889
Killing Leone
was a no-brainer for El Feo.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.991
And the minute
Leone was dead,

12:04.057 --> 12:06.226
Mrs. Saunders became a threat
that had to be eliminated.

12:06.293 --> 12:08.328
Right, so El Feo
pays Saunders to be a mole,

12:08.395 --> 12:11.431
then he tortures and kills her
and her husband.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.233
Question is,
how do we bring him down?

12:13.300 --> 12:15.135
As far as I can tell,
we don't have any evidence.

12:18.438 --> 12:20.473
I worked with a cop
who was cousins with El Feo.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.344
I--I can reach out to him.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.046
He might be a way in for us.

12:28.515 --> 12:30.683
Do you really think he'd
help us against a relative?

12:30.750 --> 12:32.719
He contacted me
a few weeks back.

12:32.786 --> 12:35.322
He got pinched with an
unregistered firearm.

12:35.388 --> 12:38.325
He said he needed some help,
so he might be worth a shot.

12:38.391 --> 12:40.828
Okay.

12:40.894 --> 12:43.696
Feel him out. The mayor.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.899
Your Honor.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.367
All right, Hobbs,
what do you got?

12:47.434 --> 12:48.768
We just found the kill car
in the Bronx.

12:48.836 --> 12:51.038
We found the black van.
- All right.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.841
I'm checking with the NYPD
ARGUS camera on that block.

12:56.343 --> 12:57.878
- There's our two shooters.
- Yeah.

12:57.945 --> 12:59.779
Please tell me you have a
good enough angle to ID them?

12:59.847 --> 13:02.682
Uh, not enough
for our lefty shooter, but...

13:05.919 --> 13:08.755
Yeah, there you go,
Marcus Thierre.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.092
Okay.
Tell me about Marcus Thierre.

13:12.159 --> 13:14.661
Ex-con, just released
after serving time

13:14.727 --> 13:16.930
for armed robbery,
and he's 6'1".

13:16.997 --> 13:19.632
Looks like he has
five more months to go

13:19.699 --> 13:21.201
at a halfway house--
Williamsburg.

13:21.268 --> 13:22.702
Okay, great,
you guys head over there

13:22.769 --> 13:24.237
and talk to him,
I'll shoot you the deets.

13:29.409 --> 13:30.610
Marcus?

13:30.677 --> 13:32.279
Guy's solid.

13:32.345 --> 13:33.780
Keeps to himself, mostly.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.348
- We need to pick him up.
- Yeah.

13:35.415 --> 13:37.784
For all the times he
didn't keep to himself.

13:37.851 --> 13:39.052
Can you call him?

13:39.119 --> 13:40.820
Tell him you're
bringing up a package?

13:52.165 --> 13:54.034
Marcus.

13:54.101 --> 13:55.168
FBI!

14:31.571 --> 14:33.673
- Get back!
- He's got a gun!

14:33.740 --> 14:35.175
Get down. Get down.

14:35.242 --> 14:36.443
Stay there!

14:41.915 --> 14:43.683
Suspect is running
out of the park.

14:43.750 --> 14:46.286
Shots fired, shots fired.

14:51.358 --> 14:52.725
We got eyes on him.

15:01.034 --> 15:02.970
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, man!

15:10.510 --> 15:11.478
He's gone.

15:11.544 --> 15:12.679
Hey.

15:12.745 --> 15:13.981
We heard shots.
Are you guys okay?

15:14.047 --> 15:15.515
Yeah. We're good.

15:15.582 --> 15:16.984
Okay.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.386
Let's work with NYPD
on containment, okay?

15:19.452 --> 15:20.387
Yeah.

15:23.123 --> 15:25.192
Hey, Jubal,
any luck on your end?

15:25.258 --> 15:27.194
No, not yet, but containment
is being activated.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.695
We put out a BOLO, and we're up

15:28.761 --> 15:30.430
on every camera
in the vicinity.

15:30.497 --> 15:31.798
<i>So I'll let you know
when we get a hit.</i>

15:31.864 --> 15:33.466
Okay.

15:33.533 --> 15:36.970
Hey, my cop friend, Ralphie,
wants to talk.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.305
- That's great news.
- Yeah.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.007
Let's pay him a visit.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.411
A hardware store?

15:46.113 --> 15:48.815
Thought you said
this guy was a cop.

15:48.881 --> 15:50.250
He was.

15:50.317 --> 15:53.786
He--um, he got flopped
while he was on probation.

15:53.853 --> 15:55.522
They're always trying to make
an example out of somebody.

15:55.588 --> 15:56.723
He just had bad luck.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.458
NYPD and its lingua franca.

15:58.525 --> 16:02.162
Flopped, makes it sound like
there's a comedy involved.

16:02.229 --> 16:05.465
There's nothing funny
about losing your dream job.

16:05.532 --> 16:08.835
Look, Stuart, he's a good guy.

16:08.901 --> 16:12.539
He's just had it rough
the past few years.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.974
His brother overdosed
on drugs a few years back,

16:15.042 --> 16:16.476
and they were really close,
so he kind of

16:16.543 --> 16:18.211
spiraled out after that.

16:18.278 --> 16:20.013
Started taking a lot of risks,
acting crazy.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.615
But he's back on his feet now.

16:22.682 --> 16:26.219
And he got this business
from his dad after he passed.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.691
Yeah, you're a lucky man, Stuart.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.160
Yeah, Tiff's not gonna
say it out loud,

16:33.226 --> 16:36.096
but she was first in our class
over at the academy.

16:36.163 --> 16:38.098
Even won company sharpshooter.

16:38.165 --> 16:40.300
All right.
That's enough butt kissing.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.335
I mean,
she's modest to a fault.

16:42.402 --> 16:44.171
Enough.

16:44.237 --> 16:45.772
Okay.

16:45.838 --> 16:48.075
Let's talk about
something else.

16:48.141 --> 16:50.777
Like my cousin El Feo.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.345
Primo supremo.

16:52.412 --> 16:53.680
You still see him?

16:53.746 --> 16:56.516
Yeah, he's always after me,
man, you know?

16:56.583 --> 16:59.052
Wants me to come use my skills,
do B&E jobs,

16:59.119 --> 17:01.321
promises me riches.

17:01.388 --> 17:04.324
Like, I wanna work for a guy
who kills half his employees.

17:04.391 --> 17:06.059
You talk lately?

17:10.430 --> 17:12.031
Yeah, El Feo
reached out last week,

17:12.099 --> 17:14.033
invited me over to his place.

17:14.101 --> 17:16.103
Likes to show off his mansion.

17:16.169 --> 17:18.037
He's moving on up, you know?

17:18.105 --> 17:20.607
Well, if you wanna help us
take him down,

17:20.673 --> 17:23.476
plant a wire, get him talking,
maybe that gun charge--

17:23.543 --> 17:26.146
Wait, wait, wait, you said
you can't help with that.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.480
You said that's a State beef.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.048
No, no, no,
what I said was that I--

17:29.116 --> 17:31.084
And can you believe that
that rat fink prosecutor

17:31.151 --> 17:33.086
telling me that I deserve
to go away for a year and a day

17:33.153 --> 17:35.522
like I'm some mutt
off the street?

17:35.588 --> 17:37.490
No, but that animal, El Feo,

17:37.557 --> 17:42.195
he kills people for fun,
he gets a mansion, fancy cars.

17:42.262 --> 17:44.897
And you know just as well
as I do that that scumbag,

17:44.964 --> 17:46.199
he killed my brother Michael.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.200
No, no, no,
we don't know that.

17:47.267 --> 17:48.835
Yeah, I do know that!

17:48.901 --> 17:51.304
And that's a fact, Tiff!

17:51.371 --> 17:53.573
Tiff, he running
this neighborhood.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.908
Who you think supplying
all the heroin here?

17:55.975 --> 17:57.277
Come on.

17:57.344 --> 17:59.479
And if it's cut with fentanyl,
guess what?

17:59.546 --> 18:00.580
It's because of him.

18:00.647 --> 18:01.848
He's telling his people
to do it.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.550
Okay, look,

18:03.616 --> 18:06.386
maybe you should just use this
as motivation to take him down.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.228
So we good?

18:15.295 --> 18:17.197
You in?

18:17.264 --> 18:20.066
<i>Hey, anybody back there?</i>

18:20.133 --> 18:22.101
Ralphie, you in?

18:24.003 --> 18:25.872
Yeah. I'm in.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.007
For pleasure.

18:28.074 --> 18:30.777
- Okay.
- Yeah? All right.

18:30.843 --> 18:33.280
I got you. I'm your man.

18:35.215 --> 18:37.184
I gotta get back to work.
- Yeah.

18:41.188 --> 18:42.555
I don't know about this, Tiff.

18:44.724 --> 18:47.093
That's a lot of anger he's got
towards his cousin.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.629
No, he can do it.
He's just, um...

18:49.696 --> 18:51.264
Unhinged?

18:55.468 --> 18:58.538
He just wears his heart
on his sleeve.

18:58.605 --> 18:59.606
Look, he's a good guy,

18:59.672 --> 19:00.973
and he deserves
a second chance,

19:01.040 --> 19:04.076
so I'd really appreciate
your support on this.

19:07.914 --> 19:09.482
Yeah.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.595
Did he really lose his badge
for public intoxication?

19:22.662 --> 19:24.964
He was on probation.
One strike, you're out.

19:25.031 --> 19:27.234
But you think he's solid?
Dependable?

19:27.300 --> 19:28.501
I do.

19:28.568 --> 19:30.036
And you?

19:30.102 --> 19:31.438
You met him?

19:31.504 --> 19:32.539
Uh, yeah.

19:32.605 --> 19:33.873
Good guy.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.642
I think it's worth a shot.

19:37.544 --> 19:39.879
Okay, good.

19:39.946 --> 19:41.414
If he helps us out,
the Brooklyn DA's

19:41.481 --> 19:42.849
willing to drop his case.

19:48.621 --> 19:49.522
Okay. Thank you.

19:49.589 --> 19:51.491
We can get this.

19:51.558 --> 19:55.862
Okay, Ralphie,
this camera sees all.

19:55.928 --> 19:56.896
Okay.

19:56.963 --> 19:59.599
This earpiece just slides in.

19:59.666 --> 20:00.967
Keeps us in constant communication.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.302
No one will be able
to hear us except for you.

20:02.369 --> 20:03.403
Gotcha.

20:03.470 --> 20:06.005
This belt holds
two camera bugs.

20:06.072 --> 20:07.774
Just slide them out when
you're ready to deploy.

20:07.840 --> 20:11.143
- Easy enough.
- Mm-hmm.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.680
You guys got some real
James Bond gack going on here.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.950
So you know El Feo,
you know how he operates.

20:18.017 --> 20:19.319
Sure.

20:19.386 --> 20:20.987
So how do we get
the most bang for our buck?

20:21.053 --> 20:22.689
Yeah, he holds court
in his kitchen.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.190
He does his one-on-ones
up in his office

20:24.257 --> 20:26.225
like he's the pope holding
audiences or something.

20:26.293 --> 20:27.360
Okay. That's good.

20:27.427 --> 20:28.895
We just need information
about El Feo

20:28.961 --> 20:30.630
that ties him to the Leone
and Saunders murders.

20:30.697 --> 20:32.098
I got you.

20:32.164 --> 20:33.666
We also know that
he uses a burner.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.201
All right, we're gonna
need you to clone it.

20:35.268 --> 20:38.004
This is plug and play.
This phone into the burner.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.707
Got it. Yep.

20:40.773 --> 20:42.542
We're gonna be with you
the whole time, okay?

20:42.609 --> 20:45.312
Remember, though,
nothing obvious.

20:45.378 --> 20:46.513
Chitchat like always.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.014
Tiff, I got this.

20:49.782 --> 20:52.585
Just happy to be
back in the game.

21:01.828 --> 21:03.095
All right,
let's go live on pole cam.

21:03.162 --> 21:05.264
All right, let's hope
this dude is solid.

21:05.332 --> 21:06.699
What does that mean?

21:06.766 --> 21:09.302
He's a failed cop,
hoping for his day in the sun,

21:09.369 --> 21:12.305
and we're sending him
into the dragon's lair.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.612
Just give him a chance.

21:25.652 --> 21:27.253
<i>Hands out.</i>

21:27.320 --> 21:28.455
<i>Really?</i>

21:28.521 --> 21:29.656
Gonna make you
frisk his own cousin now?

21:29.722 --> 21:31.824
Man, he has us
frisk his own momma.

21:39.899 --> 21:42.034
Yo, yo.
Up against the wall, gangsters.

21:42.101 --> 21:44.270
This is a raid.
- Funny guy.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.110
That guy
in the blue shirt,

21:51.177 --> 21:52.912
that's Junior Ruiz,
known associate

21:52.979 --> 21:54.614
of our other shooter,
Marcus Thierre.

21:54.681 --> 21:57.684
Also a 5'7" lefty.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.452
See? Ralphie's already
helping us out.

21:59.519 --> 22:00.820
<i>You finally made it.</i>

22:00.887 --> 22:02.755
<i>You always telling me
I should drop by,</i>

22:02.822 --> 22:04.123
<i>so here I am.</i>

22:06.225 --> 22:09.996
Ey, yo, cuz, for real, what you
doing blasting off in the hood

22:10.062 --> 22:12.732
during my nap time?

22:12.799 --> 22:15.468
So much for
run-of-the-mill chitchat.

22:15.535 --> 22:19.372
You seriously can't
afford silencers now?

22:19.439 --> 22:21.240
What is he doing?

22:21.307 --> 22:23.242
Ralphie, knock it off.

22:23.309 --> 22:24.544
I heard about that
tragedy that happened

22:24.611 --> 22:25.612
in the old neighborhood.

22:25.678 --> 22:27.680
Makes me sad.

22:27.747 --> 22:30.049
But with violence
like that, Charlie,

22:30.116 --> 22:32.118
how can people still wonder
why I left Brooklyn?

22:37.223 --> 22:38.925
It's a beautiful picture
of Abuelita.

22:42.294 --> 22:43.630
My abuelita.

22:43.696 --> 22:44.697
You know she hated your

22:44.764 --> 22:46.132
drug-dealing ass,
though, right?

22:46.198 --> 22:48.435
Yeah, but she loved the
big-ass house I bought her.

22:50.637 --> 22:52.539
Abuelita.

22:56.443 --> 22:57.544
Yeah.

22:57.610 --> 22:59.446
So you want to come
work for me?

23:01.013 --> 23:02.415
I gotta ask, primo.

23:07.386 --> 23:08.621
Why now?

23:08.688 --> 23:10.056
Tell him you wanna
buy out your building.

23:10.122 --> 23:11.891
You're tired of your
landlord raising your rent.

23:13.426 --> 23:16.228
'Cause, man--

23:16.295 --> 23:18.297
hey, look, you know
what my business has become.

23:18.364 --> 23:20.366
I got old people
losing their keys.

23:20.433 --> 23:22.835
I got to go let 'em in.
I don't even wanna charge 'em.

23:22.902 --> 23:25.404
I didn't ask you what
was wrong with your life.

23:25.472 --> 23:27.006
I asked you why now.

23:27.073 --> 23:30.076
Why now I'm suddenly not
so horrible to work for?

23:31.310 --> 23:32.812
It's simple.

23:32.879 --> 23:35.347
'Cause I got to get mine.

23:35.414 --> 23:36.683
I'm tired of playing
by the rules

23:36.749 --> 23:38.518
and living like a peasant.

23:38.585 --> 23:39.919
That's the truth.

23:41.588 --> 23:42.889
I don't buy it, Ralphie boy.

23:42.955 --> 23:44.791
Hey, look.

23:44.857 --> 23:47.026
I can open any safe
that they make.

23:47.093 --> 23:48.628
And outside of the
military-grade stuff,

23:48.695 --> 23:50.362
I can get around
any alarm system.

23:50.429 --> 23:51.631
You hear this guy?

23:51.698 --> 23:55.334
All the sudden, he wants
to be a master criminal?

23:55.401 --> 23:57.537
Once a cop, always a cop.

23:57.604 --> 23:59.972
- We need to pull him.
- No. Just give him a chance.

24:00.039 --> 24:03.309
Tiff, you're gonna get
your friend here killed.

24:03.375 --> 24:06.913
I was a cop for six months,
ten years ago, dummy.

24:06.979 --> 24:07.947
And they flopped my ass.

24:08.014 --> 24:09.148
Man, what--

24:12.752 --> 24:14.186
Okay, you know what? Ey, fine.

24:14.253 --> 24:15.755
Fine. All right.

24:15.822 --> 24:19.225
I'll take my skills and my
infectious charm elsewhere.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.260
I got a bunch of major
scores mapped out too.

24:21.327 --> 24:22.461
You know, if you're
not smart enough to get

24:22.529 --> 24:25.498
on the train, hell, man--
- Ralphie, relax.

24:25.565 --> 24:26.899
I'm interested.

24:29.235 --> 24:31.771
So you keep talking and maybe
we'll find something

24:31.838 --> 24:33.405
that both of us
can do together.

24:37.710 --> 24:40.547
Sounds good to me, cuz.

24:40.613 --> 24:41.948
Thank you.

24:44.050 --> 24:45.251
It's time to go to bathroom.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.053
You mind if I hit the head?

24:50.857 --> 24:52.058
Don't be so serious.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.763
Trust me, if I
didn't bust his chops,

24:56.829 --> 24:58.364
he'd know I was wired for sure.

24:58.430 --> 24:59.498
All right. Got it.

24:59.566 --> 25:00.432
<i>Where's the office?</i>

25:02.802 --> 25:04.637
Well, don't worry.

25:04.704 --> 25:06.472
I got mad lockpicking skills.

25:20.286 --> 25:21.487
Wait, wait. Right there.

25:21.554 --> 25:23.956
Right between the window
and the shelf.

25:30.563 --> 25:31.831
All right.

25:31.898 --> 25:33.566
Now where's the phone?

25:49.616 --> 25:51.417
Bingo.

25:51.483 --> 25:53.052
Cool. Simple.

25:53.119 --> 25:54.453
Plug it into the cloning phone.

25:56.823 --> 25:57.824
Hey, hey.

25:57.890 --> 26:01.828
Where's Ruiz?

26:01.894 --> 26:03.696
Hey, hey. Lock that door.

26:03.763 --> 26:05.364
I need just a second.

26:05.431 --> 26:07.399
No, you need to lock it now.

26:10.169 --> 26:11.503
<i>Lock it now.</i>

26:20.747 --> 26:22.114
Ralphie, don't move.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.034
All right, you're good. Go.

27:02.655 --> 27:04.657
Hey. Nice job.

27:04.724 --> 27:06.492
Here you go.

27:07.827 --> 27:09.662
You good?

27:11.597 --> 27:12.732
I'm good.

27:16.268 --> 27:18.337
Ralphie. What's up?

27:21.040 --> 27:23.475
These guys in here
joking about it.

27:23.542 --> 27:27.246
Living like--
living like movie stars.

27:27.313 --> 27:29.248
I know who they are, Tiff.

27:29.315 --> 27:30.883
I know what they do.

27:32.384 --> 27:34.420
Know who they kill.

27:34.486 --> 27:35.788
Makes me sick.

27:35.855 --> 27:38.090
Yeah, well, because of you,

27:38.157 --> 27:39.792
we're a lot closer
to taking him down.

27:39.859 --> 27:42.361
Just feel like
I need a shower.

27:42.428 --> 27:44.964
Just being next to that man.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.334
And this prick,

27:48.400 --> 27:50.436
this prick asked me if I wanted
to go fishing with him.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.705
You believe that?

27:52.772 --> 27:54.173
He's dropping bodies
all over the city,

27:54.240 --> 27:56.308
but yeah, sure, let's go snag
some striped bass.

27:58.410 --> 28:00.780
Like I got nothing better to
do than hang out with a killer.

28:00.847 --> 28:03.682
Well, the good news is,
because you did your job,

28:03.750 --> 28:05.051
I can help you
with your gun case.

28:05.117 --> 28:07.119
And that we're gonna nail
El Feo, all right?

28:07.186 --> 28:10.122
He's gonna pay for all the pain
and suffering he caused.

28:12.725 --> 28:14.560
Silver lining, huh?

28:18.030 --> 28:19.932
It ain't much,
but it's something.

28:19.999 --> 28:22.001
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

28:23.235 --> 28:25.237
We'll be in touch.

28:25.304 --> 28:26.538
Yeah.

28:26.605 --> 28:27.940
All right. Thank you.

28:36.648 --> 28:38.550
See? I told you he's good.

28:38.617 --> 28:41.187
We got what we needed.
- No, Tiff.

28:41.253 --> 28:43.422
We just got really lucky.

28:47.827 --> 28:49.695
Let's see the fruits
of the cloned phone.

28:49.762 --> 28:51.630
El Feo's burner only called
one other phone

28:51.697 --> 28:53.132
when the murders
were going down,

28:53.199 --> 28:55.601
and that same phone was
at the scene of both killings.

28:55.667 --> 28:57.036
Where is that
phone right now?

28:57.103 --> 28:59.538
It is on and pinging
off a cell tower in Yonkers.

28:59.605 --> 29:00.840
Narrowing it down.

29:00.907 --> 29:02.241
Gonna take a wild guess
and say we're about

29:02.308 --> 29:04.110
to reconnect
with Marcus Thierre.

29:04.176 --> 29:06.545
Okay, that phone was
at an address, 264 Garnet,

29:06.612 --> 29:07.947
for the last hour and a half.

29:08.014 --> 29:13.085
And it is now just down
the street from there.

29:13.152 --> 29:15.087
Our friends in the Yonkers PD
have cameras on that block?

29:15.154 --> 29:16.622
Uh, none of their city cams,

29:16.688 --> 29:18.324
but the PD up there
has an agreement

29:18.390 --> 29:19.691
with commercial properties.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.460
I can pick up a camera
across the street

29:21.527 --> 29:23.362
at an urgent care center.

29:23.429 --> 29:27.099
And there it is in all its
art deco glory, 264 Garnet.

29:27.166 --> 29:29.168
Can you scrub back and feather
in some biometrics?

29:29.235 --> 29:32.304
I'll lay in
some facial rec and...

29:34.140 --> 29:36.675
This is from 12 minutes ago.
- Okay. There he is.

29:36.742 --> 29:39.178
And he's holding...

29:39.245 --> 29:40.379
shopping bags.

29:40.446 --> 29:42.048
They empty?

29:42.114 --> 29:43.782
Is he going grocery shopping?

29:43.850 --> 29:45.751
There's a DeCicco's Market
four blocks away.

29:45.818 --> 29:48.220
That's where the phone is now.
- Wow. Okay.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.156
Well, I guess even killers
have to eat.

29:50.222 --> 29:52.558
Hey, Tiff, Scola,
we've located your elusive pal.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.293
Head over to the City of Hills.

30:02.434 --> 30:03.669
FBI, don't move.

30:13.645 --> 30:14.780
Your kid is gonna be
a grandparent

30:14.847 --> 30:16.582
before you're
on the streets again.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.117
Let's go.

30:21.320 --> 30:22.554
The good news
for you, Marcus,

30:22.621 --> 30:23.956
is that you are a small fry.

30:24.023 --> 30:25.291
So you help us
catch the big guy

30:25.357 --> 30:27.994
and maybe you can avoid
the death penalty.

30:28.060 --> 30:30.129
I got nothing for you.

30:30.196 --> 30:31.397
He's sticking to his story.

30:33.532 --> 30:34.800
It's uncanny.

30:34.867 --> 30:36.502
It really is.

30:36.568 --> 30:38.304
She does have your eyes.

30:40.739 --> 30:43.375
No DNA test needed.

30:43.442 --> 30:47.479
It's incredible, right,
that new baby smell,

30:47.546 --> 30:50.049
when you hold them close?

30:50.116 --> 30:51.850
There's nothing like it
in the world,

30:51.918 --> 30:54.887
especially not when
they're yours.

30:54.954 --> 30:58.690
You, Marcus,
are at a fork in the road.

30:58.757 --> 31:02.094
And so is your baby girl.

31:02.161 --> 31:04.931
The fact is, assassinating
a grand jury witness,

31:04.997 --> 31:07.099
best case scenario,
you are looking at supermax.

31:07.166 --> 31:10.469
That's 23 hours a day
inside of a windowless box.

31:10.536 --> 31:13.472
<i>No human contact
with anyone for decades.</i>

31:13.539 --> 31:15.774
<i>Decades, Marcus, you can
forget about your baby.</i>

31:18.444 --> 31:21.347
Are you really gonna choose
the tough-guy dumbass road?

31:21.413 --> 31:24.816
Come on, Marcus.
Don't ruin her life.

31:28.587 --> 31:29.521
Man.

31:34.961 --> 31:38.764
Blood wins every time.

31:41.633 --> 31:44.670
Okay, we want the name
of the other shooter.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.605
Who is it?

31:46.672 --> 31:49.375
It's Junior Ruiz.

31:49.441 --> 31:52.211
We're gonna need
more than that, okay?

31:52.278 --> 31:53.980
One killer's word over another

31:54.046 --> 31:57.016
gets us zilch,
and you, even less.

31:57.083 --> 31:59.851
All right, then how about
the murder guns, huh?

31:59.918 --> 32:02.321
With Ruiz's fingerprints
all over them?

32:02.388 --> 32:03.455
Where are they?

32:03.522 --> 32:04.523
We dumped them
in the river there,

32:04.590 --> 32:06.625
right off of Hell Gate Park.

32:06.692 --> 32:08.327
Okay, now El Feo.

32:12.598 --> 32:14.433
All right, look,
I work for Ruiz, okay?

32:14.500 --> 32:16.735
He says we have work to do,
that is all I know.

32:16.802 --> 32:20.706
So you're tell us that El Feo
told Ruiz what to do, right?

32:20.772 --> 32:22.441
That's the story
you're gonna stick with.

32:25.144 --> 32:27.779
Okay.
We got enough to grab Ruiz.

32:27.846 --> 32:29.081
And if Ruiz flips,

32:29.148 --> 32:30.349
we'll have enough
to grab El Feo.

32:30.416 --> 32:32.584
Mm-hmm.

32:42.928 --> 32:44.763
Junior Ruiz!

32:44.830 --> 32:47.866
FBI! Anybody home?

32:47.933 --> 32:50.902
Hello?
- OA.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.271
Come look at this.

32:54.173 --> 32:56.475
It's his car.
- Yep.

33:03.449 --> 33:06.185
Someone forced him
to overdose.

33:06.252 --> 33:08.287
El Feo must have heard
that we grabbed Marcus,

33:08.354 --> 33:10.289
so he killed Ruiz to tie off
the investigation.

33:10.356 --> 33:12.558
Definitely fits within
his pattern to obliterate

33:12.624 --> 33:15.027
any and all threats.

33:15.094 --> 33:17.196
Look, we need
to bring El Feo in.

33:17.263 --> 33:18.897
The case isn't perfect,
but we need to get

33:18.964 --> 33:20.366
this prick off the streets.
- Okay.

33:20.432 --> 33:23.769
I'll call Isobel, get her okay.

33:59.605 --> 34:02.074
FBI. Hands up.

34:17.089 --> 34:18.890
This one wants to play dumb.

34:18.957 --> 34:20.592
What about you?

34:20.659 --> 34:21.860
Where's El Feo?

34:21.927 --> 34:23.129
<i>No Ingles.</i>

34:27.233 --> 34:29.101
No El Feo, boss.
He's in the wind.

34:37.909 --> 34:39.111
Mr. El Feo was not
at his house.

34:39.178 --> 34:40.846
That means he is in the wind
for now.

34:40.912 --> 34:43.115
Question, how did he get away,
where is he going, and why?

34:43.182 --> 34:46.785
Is he actually running or is
he just out running errands?

34:46.852 --> 34:48.220
Okay,
we've been scrubbing through

34:48.287 --> 34:49.721
all the pole camera coverage,
and there's no sign

34:49.788 --> 34:51.223
of El Feo leaving his premises.

34:51.290 --> 34:53.659
Only a Suburban driven
by one of his crew.

34:53.725 --> 34:55.827
I'll track that.

34:55.894 --> 34:58.330
And this is a camera
half a mile from his house.

34:58.397 --> 35:01.500
There is the Suburban.
- Yeah, yeah. Right there.

35:01.567 --> 35:03.369
So what, he snuck out
of his own house?

35:03.435 --> 35:04.570
Well, guy's a pro.

35:04.636 --> 35:05.737
Knows someone's
always watching him.

35:05.804 --> 35:07.939
Where--where is
that car right now?

35:08.006 --> 35:11.510
Based on traffic cameras,
our last sighting is

35:11.577 --> 35:12.844
the exit for Randall's Island.

35:12.911 --> 35:14.346
All right, hey, Tiff,

35:14.413 --> 35:16.548
<i>any idea where El Feo
might be heading?</i>

35:16.615 --> 35:18.484
Actually, our CW Ralphie said

35:18.550 --> 35:21.052
El Feo invited him
to go fishing.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.721
If he's on Randall's Island,
he might be

35:22.788 --> 35:23.889
headed for Little Hell Gate.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.491
Okay, so our bad guy
is looking

35:25.557 --> 35:28.594
for a little unmolested angling
in the midst of a bloodbath?

35:28.660 --> 35:31.029
You guys head out there.
I'll send back up.

35:47.779 --> 35:49.114
This is Ralphie's car.

35:51.283 --> 35:52.551
There's blood here.

35:54.586 --> 35:56.222
Some more right here.

35:58.990 --> 36:01.560
So maybe El Feo saw through
Ralphie's song and dance?

36:04.162 --> 36:05.497
This way.

36:15.941 --> 36:18.844
Look, your friends are here.

36:21.913 --> 36:23.014
What the hell are you doing?

36:23.081 --> 36:24.650
You stay out of this, Tiff.

36:24.716 --> 36:25.851
You gotta put that gun down.

36:25.917 --> 36:27.719
Nah, this lying prick
right here,

36:27.786 --> 36:29.421
he's always giving
these big speeches

36:29.488 --> 36:31.089
about protecting
the neighborhood,

36:31.156 --> 36:33.825
about sticking together,
about loyalty!

36:33.892 --> 36:35.827
Ralphie, put the gun down!

36:39.865 --> 36:41.166
He killed my brother!

36:41.233 --> 36:43.034
He shot that stuff
up his nose, not me.

36:43.101 --> 36:44.836
Ralphie,
this is the last thing

36:44.903 --> 36:46.037
Michael would want you to do.

36:46.104 --> 36:48.507
Nah, nah.
Mike hated this prick.

36:48.574 --> 36:51.543
Ralphie, we got him
on the murder charges, okay?

36:51.610 --> 36:53.044
And how long you guys
been trying?

36:53.111 --> 36:55.180
For years, right, huh?
- You got to trust me, Ralphie.

36:55.247 --> 36:56.915
It's a rock solid
death penalty case.

36:56.982 --> 36:58.149
He's gonna buy thousands
of lawyers.

36:58.216 --> 36:59.918
And he's gonna walk away.
He always does.

36:59.985 --> 37:01.052
Okay, you can go on
with your life,

37:01.119 --> 37:02.654
but you got to
put the gun down.

37:02.721 --> 37:04.690
Yeah, sure. Right?

37:04.756 --> 37:06.057
What, they gonna give me
a pass, huh,

37:06.124 --> 37:07.793
for killing Ruiz?
I ain't that dumb.

37:07.859 --> 37:09.928
No, the right jury
will see he had it coming.

37:09.995 --> 37:12.631
You don't have the balls, cobarde.

37:14.466 --> 37:15.634
Ralphie.

37:18.970 --> 37:20.539
All right, you're not
leaving me a choice.

37:20.606 --> 37:22.808
Well, we gotta do what we
gotta do then, huh, Tiff?

37:25.043 --> 37:27.779
Come on, Ralphie,
just put the gun down.

37:27.846 --> 37:29.581
Now!
- He's not listening!

37:29.648 --> 37:32.050
- Quiet!
- Ralphie, please?

37:34.620 --> 37:36.955
Drop the gun!

37:37.022 --> 37:38.657
This lowlife ain't
walking away today.

37:52.237 --> 37:55.574
We need a ambulance
at Little Hell Gate now.

37:55.641 --> 37:56.808
Ralphie.

38:00.312 --> 38:01.780
Come on, Ralphie!

38:27.773 --> 38:29.408
You know, trust me,

38:29.475 --> 38:33.445
I get wanting to avenge
a murdered brother.

38:33.512 --> 38:36.515
Six months after 9/11,
all I wanted to do

38:36.582 --> 38:39.485
was drink and kill.

38:39.551 --> 38:40.886
But you didn't.

38:40.952 --> 38:45.591
Well, I mean, kill, at least.

38:45.657 --> 38:49.327
Walked away
from a ton of money,

38:49.395 --> 38:52.230
become a field agent.

38:57.436 --> 39:00.038
Man, the things that grief
will make a person do.

39:00.105 --> 39:03.442
Tiff, you had no way
of knowing that Ralphie

39:03.509 --> 39:05.243
was gonna go after El Feo.

39:05.310 --> 39:09.180
No, but I know
who Ralphie is.

39:11.550 --> 39:12.684
Was.

39:14.219 --> 39:17.889
He is a wild man.
He just is.

39:17.956 --> 39:23.061
So I gotta ask,
why'd you put him under?

39:25.263 --> 39:27.499
I was a big reason why
Ralphie's life fell apart.

39:27.566 --> 39:29.435
What do you mean?

39:31.470 --> 39:35.407
The night that Ralphie
got flopped,

39:35.474 --> 39:40.579
we went out drinking
after a funeral for this cop.

39:40.646 --> 39:46.251
We got really drunk and
pulled this stupid-ass prank,

39:46.317 --> 39:48.820
and Ralphie was the only
one that got caught.

39:50.188 --> 39:53.124
The brass leaned on him hard
for names.

39:55.026 --> 39:56.327
But he wouldn't roll.

39:59.097 --> 40:00.966
And so they flopped him.

40:02.734 --> 40:04.470
They took his badge.

40:07.238 --> 40:08.640
If it wasn't
for Ralphie's loyalty,

40:08.707 --> 40:10.876
I'd have got blown up too.

40:13.078 --> 40:18.183
So I guess we both owe
Ralphie a big thank you.

40:28.059 --> 40:31.463
To Ralphie.

40:31.530 --> 40:33.331
To Ralphie.
