00:07.790 --> 00:10.510
Correction. You literally got
him almost killed.

00:10.550 --> 00:13.130
He was with you and he ended up
with a bullet in his stomach.

00:13.180 --> 00:14.470
He's much safer with me.

00:14.510 --> 00:16.010
That is such a load of bull.

00:16.050 --> 00:17.640
You know, you're too old
to look after Des.

00:17.680 --> 00:20.220
Just think about it. Even if he
needed, say, a kidney, okay --

00:20.270 --> 00:22.480
They wouldn't be able to use
yours because it'd be, too like,

00:22.520 --> 00:24.440

00:38.370 --> 00:42.620
see if you can spot some
drug users, alright?

00:42.660 --> 00:44.250
I gotta go, okay? Just do me
a favor. Tonight, try not to

00:44.290 --> 00:45.790

He looks pretty druggy.

00:52.300 --> 00:53.420
[Jake]
Yeah, he does look kinda druggy,

00:53.470 --> 00:55.010
but that's not who
I was thinking about.

00:55.050 --> 00:57.720
I was thinking about the people
in the methadone line. Okay?

That's gross. Or awesome.

Gobstoppers. But Jake, Jake.

I'm sorry, but if that doctor
takes any blood from me

01:16.320 --> 01:16.910

10:01.640 --> 10:04.600
Vince. I heard on the news.
He escaped. So you're --

10:04.640 --> 10:05.640
you're with the police?

10:05.680 --> 10:07.230
We're private investigators.

10:07.270 --> 10:10.310
He kidnapped a friend of ours,
so any information you might

10:10.360 --> 10:11.730
have would be really
appreciated.

10:11.770 --> 10:14.440
Of course.
I worked here with Vince.

10:14.480 --> 10:16.200
And he was a great
mentor to the kids.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.740
But what he did --

10:17.780 --> 10:21.410
dealing out of the center --
it just, it broke our hearts.

10:21.450 --> 10:23.160
Doctor Wedgewood, do you know
anyone named Billy

10:23.200 --> 10:24.450
in the neighborhood?

10:24.490 --> 10:25.660
He might have been someone
who ran with Vince?

10:27.120 --> 10:29.870
Billy. You know what?
There was a Billy. I didn't know

10:29.920 --> 10:32.590
him that well. Um...
Billy Cantrell.

10:32.630 --> 10:34.750
He volunteered here while
he was trying to get clean.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.090
Can you think of any reason why
Vince would be looking for him?

10:37.130 --> 10:39.550
Well, I do know that Billy --
he was the main witness for

10:39.590 --> 10:41.470
the prosecution
in Vince's trial.

10:41.510 --> 10:44.470
Great. So now he's armed and
he's got a reason for revenge.

10:44.510 --> 10:46.980
Doctor. We're going to need
Billy's address.

10:47.810 --> 10:48.730
Um...

10:55.610 --> 10:56.240
Hey!

10:56.780 --> 10:59.780
Ah! [punch]

11:00.450 --> 11:01.530
Des! Are you okay?

11:01.570 --> 11:02.660
[Des] Jake!

11:03.580 --> 11:04.410
I'm sorry.

11:04.450 --> 11:05.540
It's not what it looks like.

11:05.580 --> 11:06.450
Yeah! Just wait, okay.
Don't hurt him!

11:08.160 --> 11:10.370
You're kind of putting a little
pressure to my windpipe there--

11:10.420 --> 11:11.290
ease up, pal.

11:11.330 --> 11:12.330
What were guys gonna do, huh?

11:12.380 --> 11:13.960
Bash his little head
in with this?

11:14.000 --> 11:15.300
No! The old guy is the one that
bashed his head in with that.

11:16.130 --> 11:16.170
That's actually a good point.

11:17.800 --> 11:19.510
They were trying to break the
handcuffs with a pick axe.

11:19.550 --> 11:20.470
Cops will be here
in five minutes.

11:20.510 --> 11:21.720
No! No! Just hold on!

11:21.760 --> 11:23.350
Everyone just stop hurting me
and calm down!

11:23.390 --> 11:24.810
Okay? Okay?

11:25.720 --> 11:26.350
Just hear us out.

11:27.100 --> 11:28.060
Jake just let him go.

11:31.100 --> 11:32.100
Ah!

11:34.110 --> 11:35.610
- Billy's helping us.
- Us?

11:35.650 --> 11:38.240
Yeah, Billy. We need him to
recant his testimony.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.740
Clear my name.

11:39.780 --> 11:40.820
Vince is innocent. We just need
the evidence to prove it.

11:42.240 --> 11:45.080
I am. We were making a big
difference at the center.

11:45.120 --> 11:46.370
Vince helped
a lot of us keep clean.

11:46.410 --> 11:48.660
Which is bad news
for a local drug dealer.

11:49.290 --> 11:50.460
Taylor Gossard.

11:50.500 --> 11:51.580
Oh, I've met him.

11:51.620 --> 11:53.920
He made me frame Vince.
I had no choice.

11:53.960 --> 11:56.880
He's the one that put the drugs
in my office at the center.

11:56.920 --> 11:58.840
When Billy got clean he came
to see me in prison.

11:58.880 --> 12:01.590
There's a tape. A security tape
at the outreach center

12:01.630 --> 12:03.720
that will clear Vince.
Taylor told me to destroy it --

12:03.760 --> 12:06.930
But he didn't. We need to get
that tape to the cops.

12:06.970 --> 12:08.680
It'll prove who planted
those drugs in my office.

12:08.720 --> 12:09.850
[bang on the door]

12:09.890 --> 12:11.600
Billy, get out here now!

12:11.640 --> 12:14.900
That's Taylor. If he knows I'm
with you, he's gonna kill me.

12:16.190 --> 12:17.150
Billy wait!

12:17.190 --> 12:18.690
Out the back now. C'mon.

12:18.730 --> 12:20.940
I gotta feeling this is gonna
get messy. If I uncuff you,

12:20.990 --> 12:21.570
do I have to worry
about watching my back?

12:22.910 --> 12:24.700
I wanna get my hands on Taylor
more than anyone.

12:25.570 --> 12:27.120
Do not make me regret this.

12:27.160 --> 12:29.750
I was really getting used
to our closeness, actually.

12:29.790 --> 12:30.950
Des! C'mon.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Oh. We gotta go.

12:35.830 --> 12:39.460
Vince Lanegan. As far as I know,
you're a convicted felon.

12:39.500 --> 12:40.760
Escaped from jail.

12:40.800 --> 12:43.630
I guess it's our duty to
take 'em in, hey fellas?

12:43.680 --> 12:46.640
Oh, now b'ys -- just don't.
Here we go. Whoa!

12:47.220 --> 12:48.100
D'oh!

12:48.970 --> 12:49.850
[thud]

12:51.770 --> 12:52.770
[punch]

12:54.730 --> 12:55.860
Hey! [bang]

12:57.480 --> 12:58.570
Sorry.

12:58.610 --> 13:00.320
Des? You hurt?

13:00.360 --> 13:02.950
Not as bad as when you brained
me with the pick so -- yeah.

13:03.490 --> 13:04.450
See?

13:05.450 --> 13:06.490
Where's Vince?

13:06.530 --> 13:08.370
He went that way.
The outreach center.

13:14.080 --> 13:15.370
[Jake] Vince? Are you here?

13:15.830 --> 13:16.830
Billy?

13:16.880 --> 13:18.040
I don't think he's here.

13:24.220 --> 13:25.380
What the hell happened?

13:29.260 --> 13:30.510
Dad. He's dead.

13:30.560 --> 13:33.100
Vince? What did you do?

13:34.560 --> 13:35.690
You don't think that I.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.650
I got nothing to do with this.

13:39.060 --> 13:39.690
[sirens]

13:40.570 --> 13:41.940
We gotta get outa here. Now.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.360
Billy was a good kid.

13:48.410 --> 13:50.160
He was just starting
to get his life together.

13:50.200 --> 13:51.580
You know how this looks Vince.

13:51.620 --> 13:53.370
The cops are going to think this
was revenge for Billy

13:53.410 --> 13:54.660
putting you behind bars.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.370
No, see, it must have been
Taylor. I walked in.

13:56.410 --> 13:58.500
Billy was dead.
He was just lying there.

13:58.540 --> 14:01.710
I need Billy to prove I'm
innocent. I wouldn't kill him.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.670
Des, I'm sorry I dragged you
into this mess.

14:04.710 --> 14:07.220
No, no, no, no. I know good
people when I meet good people

14:07.260 --> 14:08.340
and I can feel
that you're not lying.

14:09.090 --> 14:10.760
Thank God you're safe.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.350
Yes b'y I'm best kind.

14:13.770 --> 14:15.980
The cops think that Billy's
death was an overdose.

14:16.020 --> 14:17.390
No. He was murdered.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.560
Taylor wanted him out of the way
before he could recant

14:19.600 --> 14:21.480
his testimony
and before I got that tape.

14:21.520 --> 14:22.770
I'm sorry, but shouldn't be we
turning this guy

14:22.820 --> 14:23.570
over to the cops?

14:23.610 --> 14:25.150
We're in deep enough here.

14:25.190 --> 14:27.280
No, guys, you have to trust me.
Please. We gotta help Vince.

14:28.950 --> 14:31.490
If there's more going on, we're
gonna need to find that tape.

14:31.530 --> 14:32.080
Exactly.

14:32.120 --> 14:32.160
Watch your back.

14:33.740 --> 14:36.040
Buckmaster's will be locked down
tight, so we're gonna need

14:36.080 --> 14:36.210
to find a creative way in.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.120
You think I'm leaving
the boy here with you?

14:39.170 --> 14:40.790
He'll be dropped
from a building next.

14:40.830 --> 14:43.170
Oh yeah. Like he'll be much
better with you.

14:43.210 --> 14:45.050
You find Billy's body. Okay?

14:45.090 --> 14:46.420
See if you can find any evidence
or something.

14:46.460 --> 14:47.630
Make yourself useful.

14:47.670 --> 14:49.550
Hope you guys don't mind
riding in the trunk.

14:52.890 --> 14:55.560
Look, if this is your wife
again, can you just tell her

14:55.600 --> 14:56.430
I'm not all that into her?

14:58.020 --> 15:01.110
Whatever happened to all the fun
loving penitentiary guards?

15:02.440 --> 15:04.860
Well hello. Kevin Crocker here.

15:04.900 --> 15:07.030
I should say if this is
a telemarketer, you're in for

15:07.070 --> 15:08.490
a hell of a surprise.

15:11.780 --> 15:13.990
Okay, so you're not
a telemarketer. Who is this?

15:16.870 --> 15:17.700
C'mon you gotta
give me something.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.330
At least breathe heavy.

15:19.370 --> 15:22.130
You see, a man living in a hell
hole can use some inspiration.

15:26.460 --> 15:28.420
Turns out it was your wife.

15:37.310 --> 15:38.640
[rattling car engine]

15:44.020 --> 15:45.480
The real police
are working here.

15:46.780 --> 15:47.480
Where are they to? Oh!

15:49.070 --> 15:52.070
You're talking about all these
other people walking around.

15:52.110 --> 15:53.030
Got ya.

15:53.070 --> 15:53.780
Shut the engine off.

15:54.530 --> 15:55.830
Out of the car, Doyle.

15:55.870 --> 15:57.160
You know I'm tired
of this from you.

15:57.200 --> 15:58.450
What's your problem?

15:58.490 --> 16:00.290
Sergeant Hood.
Lunch was delivered over there.

16:01.460 --> 16:02.580
You're lucky I'm hungry.

16:05.340 --> 16:06.670
There's no lunch.

16:06.710 --> 16:08.840
I could just see you needed
a little wing manning.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.380
Nicely played.
I really appreciate that.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.510
Now run along,
and maybe we'll see you soon.

16:13.930 --> 16:14.850
Yeah.

16:15.850 --> 16:17.350
[car engine stutters]

16:20.230 --> 16:21.520
Just stay cool.

16:21.560 --> 16:23.440
Stay cool.
In a trunk with no air?

16:23.480 --> 16:24.440
How do you expect
to do that exactly?

16:25.190 --> 16:26.400
God I hate small spaces.

16:28.070 --> 16:30.690
It's kinda new, you know, to me.
The car, I mean --

16:30.740 --> 16:32.700
Sounds like your battery.
We can give you a jump. Hood!

16:33.490 --> 16:35.030
We got any jumper cables?

16:35.070 --> 16:37.200
No no I'm good. I think I'll be
able to do this myself.

16:37.240 --> 16:39.200
Newfoundland Fonsie's
car on the fritz?

16:39.240 --> 16:41.080
Fonsie rode a motorcycle,
alright bellhead?

16:41.660 --> 16:42.620
I got no cables.

16:42.660 --> 16:43.750
Unlock your trunk.

16:46.250 --> 16:47.840
Seriously. Unlock your trunk.

16:47.880 --> 16:49.380
No, no, no.
Honestly, you can feel it.

16:49.420 --> 16:51.130
You can feel like
it's gonna fix itself.

16:51.170 --> 16:54.510
I know you got cables Doyle.
If I gotta open that myself --

16:55.840 --> 16:57.970
I ain't paying
for no busted trunk.

17:05.350 --> 17:07.730
[engine starts]

17:07.770 --> 17:09.230
Aha!

17:09.270 --> 17:10.030
Oh my God.

17:11.530 --> 17:14.490
See, what did I tell ya.
It's a good rig -- this car is.

17:15.820 --> 17:17.490
Listen -- it was nice
talking to you.

17:23.790 --> 17:26.540
Okay my paramedic friend says
that Billy's body's being moved

17:26.580 --> 17:30.250
to a morgue and we've got
about two minutes before he

17:30.300 --> 17:30.800
comes to check it out.

17:31.630 --> 17:32.970
Let's make this fast then.

17:36.260 --> 17:37.180
Okay.

17:37.890 --> 17:38.800
Here you go.

17:40.640 --> 17:42.930
If Des really believes this guy
Vince is innocent, he wants

17:42.970 --> 17:46.890
to help him. And to be honest --
I can't say no to Des.

17:46.940 --> 17:48.350
Not after everything
he's been through.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.400
Well he does have a soft spot
for the lovable jailbird.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.940
Likely has something to do with
the fact that his dad is serving

17:52.980 --> 17:54.070
time in Nova Scotia.

17:54.110 --> 17:55.360
Let's hope we don't
end up joining him

17:55.400 --> 17:56.530
for helping a fugitive.

17:56.570 --> 17:57.360
Now, let's see
what's going on here.

17:58.990 --> 18:01.580
Okay. They think it's an Oxy
overdose, so check his left arm

18:01.620 --> 18:02.620
for needle marks.

18:05.620 --> 18:06.540
Okay.

18:10.580 --> 18:13.260
His personal effects.
Watch, wallet, cell phone.

18:13.880 --> 18:14.550
Battery's dead.

18:14.590 --> 18:15.880
Take out the SIM card.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.550
I can use it to get
his phone list and history.

18:18.300 --> 18:19.640
Crafty. And a beauty.

18:19.680 --> 18:21.260
Oh, honey. Don't hit on me here.

18:21.300 --> 18:21.930
Right.

18:23.010 --> 18:24.390
Let's get that back
to the office.

18:25.140 --> 18:26.100
You can hit on me there.

18:37.150 --> 18:38.410
[Jake] We still got a massive
police presence around here.

18:39.950 --> 18:41.530
We're gonna need some kind of
distraction if we're going

18:41.570 --> 18:42.620
to get into Billy's house.

18:42.660 --> 18:43.160
There's no way
we can get past them.

18:44.290 --> 18:45.790
We need to get
inside to get that tape.

18:46.620 --> 18:47.960
I got an idea. Kid!

18:48.000 --> 18:49.500
You! Come here!

18:49.540 --> 18:52.040
Vince.
I'm gonna need your coveralls.

18:52.670 --> 18:53.800
You. Come here.

19:03.140 --> 19:05.850
What the? Kid!
Where did you get that?

19:06.810 --> 19:08.100
I don't gotta tell you nuthin'.

19:08.140 --> 19:08.940
Don't be a brat.
This is important.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.440
Where did you find
the coveralls?

19:11.480 --> 19:12.480
You're not supposed to talk to
me without a parent present.

19:14.020 --> 19:16.570
If you don't be nice, I'll
scream and say you touched me.

19:16.610 --> 19:18.110
You're a dick,
do you know that kid?

19:18.150 --> 19:21.820
Hundred bucks. Or I'll tell mom
you said a bad word. Dick.

19:22.570 --> 19:23.660
Yeah, I heard you.

19:25.830 --> 19:26.910
Here's twenty. Knock it off.

19:28.210 --> 19:31.000
Some naked guy dropped it.
Ran down that way.

19:35.550 --> 19:38.970
[sirens]

19:49.730 --> 19:51.480
Alright. Great.

19:51.520 --> 19:52.810
I've got Billy's
cell phone history.

19:54.190 --> 19:55.570
Looks like he made a call right
before he died.

19:55.610 --> 19:56.820
Dr. Wedgewood's office.

19:56.860 --> 19:58.480
Didn't the doctor say
she barely knew Billy?

19:58.530 --> 19:59.820
Do you think
she's hiding something?

19:59.860 --> 20:02.410
Isn't everyone? Let's go see her
and find out what.

20:06.990 --> 20:08.410
This guy was messier
than you Jake.

20:08.450 --> 20:09.120
Just find the tape.

20:10.160 --> 20:11.870
He wasn't the most
organized guy.

20:11.910 --> 20:14.250
You, sporty. Put on a pair
of pants will ya?

20:14.290 --> 20:18.090
Upside down guitar? What's on
the go with that? That's mad.

20:18.130 --> 20:19.420
He was left handed.

20:19.460 --> 20:20.840
Part of his rehab was to learn
an instrument.

20:20.880 --> 20:21.010
He was pretty good.

20:22.470 --> 20:25.180
He had a bunch of parking
tickets -- for the same car

20:25.220 --> 20:26.390
parked in the same street.

20:26.760 --> 20:26.810
So?

20:28.350 --> 20:29.850
A car's a good a place to stash
a tape as anywhere else.

20:31.140 --> 20:32.390
I'm gonna go upstairs
and check things out.

20:33.190 --> 20:35.520
[discordant guitar strum]

20:35.900 --> 20:36.860
Des.

20:36.900 --> 20:37.900
Go keep an eye out.

20:45.240 --> 20:45.700
See, I had a feeling

20:47.160 --> 20:49.790
me and you'd be seeing each
other again -- real soon.

20:51.410 --> 20:55.000
Taylor Goddard. Shouldn't you be
out, you know, selling crappy

20:55.040 --> 20:57.960
drugs for a little
bit of purse change?

20:58.000 --> 21:01.470
I wouldn't exactly call it purse
change, and I gotta say,

21:02.720 --> 21:04.680
you're really cutting
in on my earning --

21:06.300 --> 21:08.220
Now you really
should watch yourself.

21:11.180 --> 21:12.100
Clever.

21:19.270 --> 21:21.980
I'm getting pretty sick of
seeing your face around here.

21:22.030 --> 21:24.570
So I tell ya -- this is what's
gonna happen -- okay?

21:26.280 --> 21:27.320
[bang]

21:27.370 --> 21:28.660
[siren]

21:30.030 --> 21:31.240
[knock on door]

21:31.290 --> 21:32.950
Police! Open up.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.960
We gotta get outa here now.
Ignore him. C'mon!

21:36.790 --> 21:38.460
I was navigating some

21:38.500 --> 21:41.710
tricky doctor-patient
confidentiality issues.

21:41.750 --> 21:43.760
So you knew him better
than you were letting on?

21:43.800 --> 21:44.550
I wasn't trying to mislead you.

21:45.970 --> 21:48.760
Billy was under my care in
an effort to get clean.

21:48.800 --> 21:50.300
What about the phone
call before he died?

21:50.350 --> 21:54.020
You have to understand that --
Billy -- he revered Vince.

21:54.060 --> 21:56.690
And after he betrayed everyone
with the dealing, Billy --

21:57.520 --> 21:57.900
Billy was crushed.

21:59.440 --> 22:02.070
And seeing Vince again today --
it triggered a relapse.

22:03.030 --> 22:04.570
So he was calling you for help.

22:04.610 --> 22:05.150
And I wasn't in the office.

22:06.400 --> 22:08.530
It will forever be one of my
great regrets --

22:08.570 --> 22:10.280
you know I missed
the call and...

22:11.780 --> 22:12.160
well, look what happened.

22:13.580 --> 22:16.040
Whoever supplied him with Oxy
should be strung up.

22:16.080 --> 22:18.710
It's a horrible drug and
obviously they discontinued it,

22:18.750 --> 22:19.880
but it's replacement
isn't much better.

22:20.500 --> 22:22.090
You know, I make it

22:22.130 --> 22:26.470
a policy to never prescribe Oxy,
even in legitimate situations.

22:26.510 --> 22:28.220
The risk of addiction
is too strong.

22:32.050 --> 22:33.560
All of these parking tickets,
they're for the same address.

22:35.220 --> 22:38.440
So Des, I want you to head over
to Patrick Street and see if you

22:38.480 --> 22:39.850
can find Billy's car.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.520
If he was too afraid to stash
the tape at his house,

22:41.560 --> 22:43.150
he might have kept
it in his car.

22:43.190 --> 22:46.990
See if you can find it. Vince,
if I was you, I'd get a lawyer.

22:47.030 --> 22:48.570
Oh, yeah, lawyers.
That's just what we need.

22:48.610 --> 22:50.200
It's not just for you,
alright pally?

22:50.240 --> 22:52.280
We're aiding and abetting
a criminal here.

22:52.320 --> 22:54.490
[ring] We need some protection,
so you call Walter.

22:54.540 --> 22:55.910
Yeah, and he's a good guy.
He can help.

22:55.950 --> 22:57.200
And stay away from the cops.

22:57.250 --> 22:58.920
Duh. Oh, I'm gonna
need money for a cab.

23:00.500 --> 23:03.920
Okay look. This is my last
twenty bucks, so I want change.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.210
Yeah, Dad, what do you got?

23:06.260 --> 23:08.920
Oxy overdose. Doctor Wedgewood
was helping Billy stay on

23:08.970 --> 23:10.930
the wagon and he called her
before he died.

23:10.970 --> 23:13.180
Plus, there was a needle
mark in his left arm.

23:13.220 --> 23:13.850
His left arm?

23:13.890 --> 23:15.100
That's correct.

23:15.140 --> 23:17.270
Vince. Did you say that Billy
was left handed?

23:17.310 --> 23:18.680
Yeah, why?

23:18.730 --> 23:20.810
That means he'd shoot up into
his right arm, right?

23:23.650 --> 23:25.650
Dad. I'm pretty sure
Billy was murdered.

23:27.280 --> 23:29.740
Best way to off an ex junkie --
make it look like an overdose.

23:29.780 --> 23:30.950
But Vince was the
only person there.

23:31.870 --> 23:33.120
Think he's still clean in this?

23:33.160 --> 23:35.490
I dunno. We got a lot more
to figure out first.

23:35.540 --> 23:36.450
Taylor!

23:36.490 --> 23:38.450
What? I'll call you back. What?

23:38.500 --> 23:40.250
Taylor! Taylor! Taylor!

23:40.290 --> 23:42.290
Just shut up kid! Shut up!
What the hell.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.040
[bonk]

23:45.500 --> 23:47.960
Jake buddy, I owed you that one.

23:55.390 --> 23:58.140
Wakey, Wakey, Jakey, Jakey.

24:02.100 --> 24:03.650
Oh great.

24:03.690 --> 24:06.860
You and me got a bit of business
to take care of, don't we buddy?

24:09.320 --> 24:12.530
Ah, you like that?
Tub of water, feet down in it?

24:13.450 --> 24:16.450
See water acts as a conductor --

24:17.330 --> 24:19.660
of electricity I mean.

24:19.700 --> 24:22.670
Good for you. You paid attention
in grade four science class.

24:27.210 --> 24:30.720
I want Billy's security tape.

24:31.220 --> 24:31.510
[zap]

24:33.050 --> 24:36.760
And I suggest you think long
and hard before you offer me

24:36.800 --> 24:36.850
a smart ass answer.

24:38.560 --> 24:44.310
Okay. It's on the bedside table
in your mother's bedroom next

24:44.350 --> 24:45.650
to the money I left her.

24:45.690 --> 24:47.860
Ha, ha, ha.

24:47.900 --> 24:49.730
Arrgh! [electrical sizzle]

24:51.990 --> 24:55.570
You think this is some kinda
joke, Mr. Doyle? Hmm?

24:57.530 --> 24:59.990
So what you're saying is --
the frame job on Vince,

25:00.040 --> 25:01.410
Billy Cantrell's murder,

25:01.450 --> 25:03.370
the Oxy trade in Buckmasters
Circle -- it's all --

25:03.410 --> 25:04.870
It's all connected,
I'm telling you.

25:04.920 --> 25:08.630
Proof Des. Alright? I need
solid, court recognizable proof.

25:08.670 --> 25:10.340
I need something I can take to
the cops, something that's

25:10.380 --> 25:12.010
gonna back up Vince's story.

25:12.050 --> 25:15.340
Without the video tape, there's
nothing. This is Billy's car.

25:15.760 --> 25:16.640
Okay.

25:18.720 --> 25:19.680
Stand back.

25:25.600 --> 25:27.190
Impressive.

25:27.230 --> 25:29.690
Thank you. That took me three
years to learn that, but I'm...

25:31.530 --> 25:33.690
Okay, so if this is true --
what you're saying --

25:33.740 --> 25:36.990
in order to convince the Crown
that he escaped custody,

25:37.030 --> 25:40.490
kidnapped you, that he is not
guilty of selling drugs

25:40.530 --> 25:43.660
or murder... I'd say, yeah,
we need the video tape.

25:45.160 --> 25:45.960
Check it out.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.540
What's that?
It's a washroom key.

25:48.580 --> 25:49.840
No better. It's a locker key.

25:49.880 --> 25:51.920
And I know exactly where it's
from. One word.

25:51.960 --> 25:53.590
Pollywog. Come on!

25:53.630 --> 25:55.010
- Pollywog.
- Pollywog!

25:55.430 --> 25:56.430
Nice.

25:56.470 --> 25:58.930
[electrical sizzle] Arrgh!

25:58.970 --> 26:02.430
Where's the video tape Billy
was hiding? Just tell me,

26:02.470 --> 26:04.100
and this could all stop.

26:04.140 --> 26:05.060
Then what?

26:07.190 --> 26:08.270
You'll kill me like you killed
Billy?

26:09.480 --> 26:11.440
What makes you think
I killed Billy. Hmm?

26:12.610 --> 26:14.150
Don't I strike you
as the gentle type?

26:14.990 --> 26:17.450
[electrical sizzle] Arrgh!

26:19.740 --> 26:20.870
You had enough?

26:20.910 --> 26:25.330
Oh God! Please don't stop.
[manic laughter]

26:26.370 --> 26:30.210
Arrgh! Ughh!
[electrical sizzle]

26:30.250 --> 26:31.420
Feels good.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.300
[coughing]

26:34.340 --> 26:37.130
You think this is some kinda
game, Jake? Well think again.

26:37.180 --> 26:38.470
Where's the tape?

26:38.510 --> 26:41.970
Arrgh! [electrical sizzle]

26:44.890 --> 26:46.930
I'm telling you man,
I don't got it.

26:46.980 --> 26:49.690
If I did, I would tell ya.

26:50.270 --> 26:51.650
I'm a crap liar.

26:51.690 --> 26:53.400
Ask anyone. [laughs]

27:00.820 --> 27:02.830
What about this
skinny friend of yours?

27:04.870 --> 27:08.040
How much of this do you think he
could take? I mean, I'd say

27:08.080 --> 27:11.830
you got about an hour
left in you.

27:11.880 --> 27:16.010
But the kid -- how long? Ten?

27:16.050 --> 27:17.670
[thud!] Arrgh!

27:24.850 --> 27:28.690
[electrical sizzle]
Arrggh!

27:38.860 --> 27:39.950
[banging on door]

27:40.780 --> 27:43.200
Taylor, what's going on!

27:47.910 --> 27:50.960
-Open the door!
-[banging on door]

27:54.000 --> 27:58.170
[banging and yelling
continues]

28:10.520 --> 28:13.350
Ahem. This is
the ladies' change room.

28:14.110 --> 28:16.270
Oh, stop complaining.

28:16.730 --> 28:18.030
Hi there.

28:18.070 --> 28:19.400
You know, I took swimming
lessons here for years.

28:19.440 --> 28:20.950
I could never get over that hump
-- past Pollywogs.

28:21.860 --> 28:23.570
Treading water always eluded me.

28:23.610 --> 28:27.120
Yeah, I'm really more of a
drinking liquids kinda guy than

28:27.160 --> 28:28.200
a swimming liquids kinda guy.

28:29.500 --> 28:30.580
Hot tubs are an exception
to the rule though.

28:32.040 --> 28:34.460
Des. Look -- 043. Come here,
come here! Get the key!

28:34.500 --> 28:37.460
Open it up! Come on. And hurry
up before the cops get here.

28:39.130 --> 28:41.550
Yeah, I'm just gonna keep watch
here. We're safety inspectors.

28:42.680 --> 28:44.970
Don't slip on that tile.
Pretty nasty.

28:47.010 --> 28:47.720
What am I supposed
to do with that?

28:48.510 --> 28:50.060
Don't worry. Don't worry.

28:50.100 --> 28:53.020
If I have a little time, I think
I can fix it. So -- oh, yeah.

28:57.020 --> 29:02.610
Hood. Hood! I found a bug in
Taylor Gossard's bar, okay?

29:02.650 --> 29:03.700
And it looked like
a standard RNC issue.

29:04.570 --> 29:05.860
You look terrible, even for you.

29:05.910 --> 29:07.620
Are you guys running
surveillance on him, or not?

29:07.660 --> 29:10.830
You back on the force? No.
You keep your nose out of this.

29:10.870 --> 29:13.500
Taylor Gossard might be guilty
of having murdered

29:13.540 --> 29:15.040
Billy Cantrell -- do you
understand that? Murdered.

29:16.380 --> 29:18.130
So if you guys are running
surveillance on him,

29:18.170 --> 29:20.760
you can prove that.
Just, just help me out here.

29:21.920 --> 29:24.760
I can't tell you anything Jake.
But...

29:27.850 --> 29:29.180
there on the desk,

29:29.220 --> 29:32.020
if you happen to see a file,
there might be something

29:32.060 --> 29:33.020
in there for you to read.

29:34.180 --> 29:36.020
You never heard that from me,
got it?

29:36.060 --> 29:38.270
Of course. I got it.

29:46.030 --> 29:48.030
Taylor Gossard... classified.

29:50.830 --> 29:50.870
Leslie.

29:52.330 --> 29:55.250
Uncle Jake? What are you doing
here? Are you okay?

29:55.290 --> 29:57.250
I'm uh -- yeah,
I'm fine, Tinny, hey.

29:57.290 --> 29:58.960
This whole thing with Des --
I'm not gonna tell anyone

29:59.000 --> 30:01.090
that you're snooping around.
I got some info for you guys.

30:01.130 --> 30:03.250
Whoa, whoa, whoa. No info.
Don't give me any info.

30:03.300 --> 30:07.430
You're in cop school, so behave
like you're a cop school person.

30:07.470 --> 30:08.970
I'm only trying to help.

30:09.010 --> 30:12.100
Tinny, whether I like it or not,
my niece is about to become

30:12.140 --> 30:12.930
one of the good guys.

30:14.140 --> 30:17.190
Stop acting like a P.I.
Act like a cop.

30:18.350 --> 30:19.810
What do you want me to do?
Arrest you?

30:19.860 --> 30:21.070
Don't be like that now.

30:21.110 --> 30:22.520
This is about Des, okay?

30:22.570 --> 30:24.690
And if I want to help,
you can't stop me.

30:24.730 --> 30:28.530
Alright fine. Fine. Just, just
do it by the book. Alright?

30:30.160 --> 30:33.830
Don't let me -- or any of us --
don't let us drag you down.

30:37.080 --> 30:38.620
Katrina.
What are you doing here?

30:38.670 --> 30:41.880
Oh, I, um, I have that case
study for the academy and I was

30:41.920 --> 30:43.710
hoping Hood could help me.

30:43.750 --> 30:47.220
Well, good luck then. I'm not
sure what Hood can do for you,

30:47.260 --> 30:48.510
but -- fill your boots.

30:48.550 --> 30:50.550
Thanks. Will do.

30:53.010 --> 30:57.770
Okay. Starting after this very
moment, stay off this case.

30:57.810 --> 30:58.940
I don't want
you getting expelled.

31:00.770 --> 31:03.650
You look very pretty
in your cop outfit.

31:07.110 --> 31:09.990
I've made a list of every doctor
within the Circle to see who's

31:10.030 --> 31:12.370
prescribing Oxy
but the files are sealed.

31:12.410 --> 31:15.330
C'mon. We need to find out who
Taylor Gossard's supplier is.

31:15.370 --> 31:16.540
I think I can help with that.

31:16.580 --> 31:18.040
Hey honey.
What are you doing here?

31:18.080 --> 31:19.040
Before you give me any grief

31:19.080 --> 31:20.210
about what I'm
about to show you,

31:20.250 --> 31:22.500
Jake already told me off.
And I don't care.

31:22.540 --> 31:24.340
This is for Des,
not for you guys.

31:24.380 --> 31:25.760
I was digging around.
And I found that.

31:27.590 --> 31:30.760
These are copies of
prescriptions for Oxy filled

31:30.800 --> 31:32.470
in pharmacies near and around
Buckmasters Circle.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.350
Hard to tell which
ones aren't legit.

31:35.390 --> 31:36.770
Instead of looking at
the patient's name,

31:36.810 --> 31:37.980
try looking at the doctor.

31:39.140 --> 31:40.190
See anyone you know?

31:40.230 --> 31:41.810
Wedgewood.
She's all over this list.

31:41.850 --> 31:43.440
Didn't she say she never
prescribed the stuff?

31:43.480 --> 31:45.230
Yeah, she made a big deal about
how bad it is for the community.

31:46.360 --> 31:47.990
Think she'd lie
to our faces again?

31:51.280 --> 31:54.200
No job is ever going to get in
the way of me helping my family.

31:54.240 --> 31:56.080
Tinny, I understand that.

31:56.120 --> 31:59.040
But please, stay out of this
from here on in. Okay?

32:04.630 --> 32:07.050
Look, I told you that I don't
know where it is.

32:07.090 --> 32:11.420
If the tape is in this building,
then the easiest thing for me

32:11.470 --> 32:15.430
to do is just burn the place to
the ground, huh? With you in it.

32:16.890 --> 32:19.770
Save me the trouble of rooting
through all those boxes.

32:19.810 --> 32:21.520
It -- Taylor please,
you don't have to do this --

32:21.560 --> 32:23.350
'cause I told you --
I don't know where it is, I --

32:23.390 --> 32:27.230
If you're lying to me, it's not
a wise course of action to take.

32:28.780 --> 32:33.160
Because I'm not in a great mood
today and I don't think

32:33.200 --> 32:34.030
I wants to be lied to.

32:34.870 --> 32:35.370
Get away from her, Taylor.

32:36.580 --> 32:37.450
Or you're not gonna
like how this ends.

32:38.740 --> 32:40.290
Something tells me you're Jake
Doyle's old man.

32:41.620 --> 32:43.880
If that's so, this is
my lucky day, isn't it?

32:44.790 --> 32:46.290
Well I loves this knife.

32:46.340 --> 32:48.170
Everyone needs someone
I suppose.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.970
RNC. Drop the weapon.

32:52.130 --> 32:52.680
How did you get here?

32:52.720 --> 32:54.090
I followed you.

32:54.130 --> 32:56.010
What are you gonna do with that
walkie, little girl?

32:56.050 --> 32:57.220
Radio me to death?

32:57.260 --> 32:57.810
There's cops crawling
all over the place.

32:59.270 --> 33:01.310
They got the Circle in lock
down. One word from me,

33:01.350 --> 33:02.600
they'll be here in seconds.

33:05.150 --> 33:07.190
It's over. Drop the weapon.

33:07.230 --> 33:08.230
Do you have cuffs?

33:09.610 --> 33:10.860
This is Malachy Doyle.

33:10.900 --> 33:12.900
We got some garbage here you
might want to see.

33:18.200 --> 33:21.580
This is nowhere near over.
I promise you that.

33:21.620 --> 33:23.460
You're right.
It's a nice knife.

33:25.880 --> 33:26.880
Nice work kid.

33:30.670 --> 33:34.470
So. I think it's time
we had a serious chat, Doctor.

33:39.100 --> 33:41.890
You wouldn't know how
intimidating he can be.

33:43.060 --> 33:44.730
It's been awful.

33:44.770 --> 33:47.690
Taylor started forcing me to
write fake Oxy scrips so that he

33:47.730 --> 33:49.560
could sell the pills.

33:49.610 --> 33:50.940
And he would
steal my script pad --

33:50.980 --> 33:52.690
anything --
I didn't have a choice.

33:52.730 --> 33:54.070
Why didn't you
just go to the police?

33:54.740 --> 33:55.320
Taylor's a killer.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.820
He controls the neighborhood.

33:57.860 --> 34:01.080
He hears everything. I would be
dead before the cops got there.

34:06.460 --> 34:08.080
Your grandfather
called for backup?

34:08.120 --> 34:10.500
He had no choice. Taylor was
threatening that doctor.

34:10.540 --> 34:12.710
What were you even doing there?
You broke protocol.

34:12.750 --> 34:14.210
You put yourself in danger.

34:14.260 --> 34:16.260
You had no right involving
yourself in this.

34:16.300 --> 34:17.970
I was being a cop.

34:18.010 --> 34:18.970
Guess what? You aren't a cop.

34:20.430 --> 34:21.970
You keep acting like Jake Doyle,
you'll never be a cop.

34:22.010 --> 34:23.470
But --

34:23.520 --> 34:25.730
If the next two words out of
your mouth are not Yes Sir,

34:25.770 --> 34:28.520
I'll go take back the word I put
in for you to avoid expulsion.

34:35.950 --> 34:36.950
He's released?

34:36.990 --> 34:38.280
Mind your own business.

34:39.620 --> 34:42.120
Tinny, you have a chance to do
something here.

34:42.910 --> 34:44.290
Don't go Doyling it up.

34:46.040 --> 34:47.170
Yes sir.

35:16.240 --> 35:17.110
Leslie.

35:17.530 --> 35:18.530
Jake.

35:21.030 --> 35:22.160
What are you doing here?

35:22.200 --> 35:24.120
I can ask you
the exact same thing.

35:28.910 --> 35:29.370
I'm under cover.

35:30.790 --> 35:32.590
We're running an operation
on Taylor and his crew.

35:33.290 --> 35:34.750
You're under cover?

35:34.790 --> 35:37.550
Why don't you broadcast it on
Paddy Daley? Shut up.

35:37.590 --> 35:38.670
I'm sorry.

35:40.010 --> 35:41.720
So you're running
a sting on Taylor.

35:41.760 --> 35:44.890
Just lay off him. He's part of
the bigger plan. Understand?

35:44.930 --> 35:49.140
I think he killed someone today.
A guy named Billy Cantrell.

35:49.180 --> 35:52.980
No. Taylor didn't murder Billy.
I been watching him all day.

35:53.020 --> 35:54.270
Trust me.

35:54.310 --> 35:56.360
Well if Taylor didn't kill
Billy, then who did?

35:56.400 --> 35:57.610
How the hell do I know?

35:57.650 --> 36:00.990
Just stay away from him. And me.
Okay?

36:01.490 --> 36:02.490
How long?

36:02.530 --> 36:04.080
How long what?
Is Taylor protected?

36:04.950 --> 36:06.950
How long are you undercover?

36:07.620 --> 36:08.500
A while.

36:15.920 --> 36:18.050
Now we're broke up.
I means it. Okay?

36:18.090 --> 36:18.420
So get out of my face, will ya?

36:19.920 --> 36:22.760
And you owes me three hundred
bucks and my old shirt.

36:22.800 --> 36:23.930
I wants it back.

36:26.890 --> 36:30.230
Ah... I'd watch out for her.
She's kinda rough.

36:36.980 --> 36:38.780
Taylor Gossard can't be guilty
of Billy Cantrell's murder.

36:40.150 --> 36:42.320
The RNC have had him under
constant surveillance.

36:42.360 --> 36:43.530
He's clean on this.

36:44.530 --> 36:45.410
Got it.

36:51.330 --> 36:54.330
Yeah. Yeah, that's my office.
And that's Taylor.

36:55.920 --> 36:59.670
And he's planting the drugs
in your desk. Des, just, just

36:59.710 --> 37:02.680
stop it right there. Pause it.
Just press pause.

37:02.720 --> 37:03.630
What?

37:07.180 --> 37:07.720
I need you to blow this area up.

37:08.810 --> 37:10.680
I'm not the FBI.
It's just a VCR man.

37:11.810 --> 37:12.600
Ah! Jee!

37:13.140 --> 37:14.770
Oh... Smart.

37:15.520 --> 37:16.150
It's Doctor Wedgewood.

37:16.900 --> 37:18.400
You gotta be kidding me.

37:18.440 --> 37:19.230
She was there.

37:19.820 --> 37:20.860
She's the one.

37:22.820 --> 37:24.030
She's the one behind this.

37:24.070 --> 37:25.030
She would definitely
have the skills

37:25.070 --> 37:26.610
to give Billy an Oxy overdose.

37:26.660 --> 37:29.410
Yeah. Maybe Billy figured out
she was involved. Makes sense.

37:29.450 --> 37:31.580
Doctor Wedgewood was there
the night that Taylor planted

37:31.620 --> 37:34.330
these drugs --
she's Vince's way out of this.

37:36.500 --> 37:37.420
Vince?

37:37.960 --> 37:38.920
Come on.

37:41.800 --> 37:44.800
Okay. Vince? Just listen to me.
I know that you're upset --

37:44.840 --> 37:45.800
Vince --

37:46.390 --> 37:47.300
Let her go.

37:47.340 --> 37:49.140
Help me! Please! Please1 Please!

37:49.180 --> 37:50.600
Just put down the scalpel, man.

37:50.640 --> 37:52.140
We have the proof to clear you.

37:52.180 --> 37:54.520
If you hurt her, it'll undo
everything. Don't throw it away.

37:54.560 --> 37:56.020
She ruins lives, this one.

37:56.060 --> 37:57.980
We know she put you inside.
Took away your freedom.

37:58.020 --> 37:59.110
We know Vince, we know.

37:59.150 --> 38:00.270
Don't let it end like this.

38:00.320 --> 38:02.400
Not just me. Dozens. Hundreds.

38:02.440 --> 38:03.990
I mean, how many addicts are out
there wasting away

38:04.030 --> 38:05.280
because of you?

38:05.320 --> 38:07.160
I didn't force those pills down
anyone's throat.

38:07.200 --> 38:09.820
Shut up.
You wrote the prescriptions,

38:09.870 --> 38:11.530
and Taylor sold
them to the addicts.

38:11.580 --> 38:13.450
That stuff was going to hit
the streets anyway.

38:13.500 --> 38:15.580
At least I was there
to control it.

38:15.620 --> 38:18.080
Don't make this about some safe
injection crap, okay?

38:18.130 --> 38:19.630
You killed Billy because he

38:19.670 --> 38:22.130
was going to expose you as a
drug pusher, plain and simple.

38:22.170 --> 38:23.210
I can cut off
the supply right now.

38:24.130 --> 38:25.340
I owe the community that much.

38:26.090 --> 38:26.550
I owe Billy that much.

38:26.590 --> 38:28.050
No Vince.

38:28.090 --> 38:30.720
What you owe this community
is to keep this place open.

38:30.760 --> 38:32.010
Show an example.

38:32.060 --> 38:34.730
Vince! You're a good guy.
I can't let you do this.

38:34.770 --> 38:35.680
Des!

38:35.730 --> 38:36.690
ARRGH!

38:38.600 --> 38:39.480
Des?

38:40.190 --> 38:41.110
Des, you okay?

38:41.150 --> 38:42.070
Ah!

38:42.110 --> 38:42.780
Des? You Okay?

38:43.280 --> 38:44.730
I think so.

38:44.780 --> 38:47.070
Why did you do that? You stupid
idiot. Call an ambulance.

38:47.110 --> 38:48.200
Arrgh!

38:50.030 --> 38:50.450
So, I've already spoken
to the Crown.

38:51.620 --> 38:53.740
Vince's conviction
will be overturned.

38:53.790 --> 38:56.210
Yeah, well if the story all
checks out, then yes.

38:56.250 --> 38:57.500
Nice work Doyles.

38:57.540 --> 38:59.330
I'd say the video tape
is gonna seal the deal.

38:59.920 --> 39:01.540
What about ah...

39:01.590 --> 39:02.290
Dr. Wedgewood?

39:03.090 --> 39:04.710
Arrested on drug charges.

39:04.750 --> 39:06.300
They'll have enough to get her
for murder, though.

39:06.340 --> 39:09.970
So the next time you feel like
harboring a convicted felon,

39:10.010 --> 39:11.470
um -- don't.

39:11.510 --> 39:13.050
Oh, and also, don't call me.

39:13.100 --> 39:15.140
Yeah I wouldn't
count on that buddy.

39:15.180 --> 39:16.890
I'm looking to get
some booze out of this.

39:16.930 --> 39:18.850
So hurry up and get
a paying gig, alright?

39:22.690 --> 39:24.110
I was pretty pissed off when you
handcuffed yourself to me.

39:24.860 --> 39:26.280
It's a good thing you did.

39:26.320 --> 39:28.240
Yeah. So when do you think you
can get the center up

39:28.280 --> 39:28.320
and running again?

39:29.530 --> 39:29.910
You should come by
and give me a hand.

39:31.280 --> 39:36.330
Okay. Okay, yeah I will.
I mean once I heal, again.

39:36.910 --> 39:37.750
Look. Thanks.

39:39.210 --> 39:43.040
For believing in me. For knowing
I was telling the truth.

39:44.630 --> 39:45.760
You're a brave guy.

39:46.460 --> 39:47.420
Good luck Vince.

39:47.840 --> 39:48.090
Yeah.

39:48.970 --> 39:50.260
C'mon buddy. Let's go home.

40:04.770 --> 40:06.070
Something tells me
you're not the

40:06.110 --> 40:08.110
"let's talk about our day"
kinda father.

40:25.960 --> 40:29.010
Well. We busted your supplier.

40:31.670 --> 40:35.350
Yeah, where am I ever gonna find
another one of those?

40:37.850 --> 40:40.100
Next time I'll make sure
you go down with him.

40:40.850 --> 40:41.190
That sounds like fun.

40:42.690 --> 40:45.650
You and me sparring it out for
the rights and freedoms

40:45.690 --> 40:47.440
of Oxy heads everywhere.

40:48.400 --> 40:49.610
Seriously though, Jake...

40:50.780 --> 40:51.820
that little niece of yours?

40:53.200 --> 40:56.030
Oh mama -- she could make
a dandy living if she'd

40:56.070 --> 40:56.950
come work for me.

40:56.990 --> 40:58.200
Excuse me?

40:58.240 --> 41:01.710
I just mean she's a very
attractive young lady.

41:03.120 --> 41:06.880
This whole "I'm a cop thing"
could work really good

41:06.920 --> 41:08.300
in an intimate situation
with a client.

41:09.840 --> 41:14.340
I mean, people pay good money
for that sort of scenario.

41:14.380 --> 41:15.550
[bottle shatters]

41:20.060 --> 41:22.810
Come on then tough guy
-- do it!

41:23.640 --> 41:24.560
Now you listen to me.

41:25.440 --> 41:29.480
If you ever even think about

41:29.520 --> 41:31.730
my niece again -- in any way,
shape or form --

41:31.780 --> 41:36.370
I swear to God I'll come back
here -- and I'll cut your throat

41:36.950 --> 41:39.240
from ear to ear.

41:40.620 --> 41:41.790
Now I don't know who
your friends are,

41:42.660 --> 41:44.330
or how you got out of jail,

41:46.330 --> 41:47.840
but I promise you this.

41:50.630 --> 41:51.840
I'm gonna ruin you.

41:53.170 --> 41:53.920
[thud]

41:55.050 --> 41:55.630
You can have your
little friend back.

41:56.930 --> 41:58.720
You're gonna need all
the friends you can get.

42:00.180 --> 42:02.470
Oh, by the way,

42:03.560 --> 42:05.310
I haven't forgot about our
little...

42:06.850 --> 42:08.270
electricity lesson.

42:26.120 --> 42:27.460
[car starts]

42:30.630 --> 42:32.760
[stutters and stalls]

42:33.630 --> 42:34.510
Oh you gotta be...
