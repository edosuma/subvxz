01:31.049 --> 01:34.386
<i>Patricia Doyle
was a good pilot and a good woman.</i>

01:34.469 --> 01:36.638
<i>She will forever be
a part of the NASA family.</i>

01:37.681 --> 01:42.561
<i>We ask that everyone give her loved ones
time to grieve in this moment of loss.</i>

01:43.145 --> 01:49.651
<i>Her tenacity and her indomitable spirit...
will be missed.</i>

01:50.569 --> 01:55.782
<i>Flags at NASA's Manned Spaceflight Center
were flown today at half-mast,</i>

01:55.866 --> 01:58.660
<i>and after a brief memorial service,</i>

01:58.744 --> 02:02.080
<i>the remains
of Astronaut Candidate Patricia Doyle...</i>

02:02.164 --> 02:03.540
We thought you might be here.

02:09.086 --> 02:10.881
You missed a really nice service.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.518
I know this is hard,

02:24.520 --> 02:26.396
so, if you need--

02:26.480 --> 02:28.482
You can save it for the Tupperware party.

02:32.110 --> 02:33.362
Fair enough.

02:49.378 --> 02:50.587
Thanks, Pam.

02:50.671 --> 02:51.755
To Patty.

02:51.839 --> 02:52.965
-To Patty.
-To Patty.

02:56.802 --> 03:00.889
I just wish we knew
what happened up there.

03:02.099 --> 03:03.642
She was a damn good pilot.

03:03.725 --> 03:05.102
So confident.

03:06.645 --> 03:08.355
That bedstead's a lousy bucket.

03:08.438 --> 03:11.567
She flew choppers.
So she wasn't trained to punch out.

03:11.650 --> 03:13.485
They don't even have ejection seats,
so they always try--

03:13.569 --> 03:16.572
She screwed the pooch.
It's the only thing that matters.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.908
She screwed the pooch.

03:21.285 --> 03:24.079
She tried to stay with the vehicle
when she should've punched out,

03:24.162 --> 03:25.414
simple as that.

03:27.082 --> 03:28.292
Now she's gone.

03:32.963 --> 03:34.673
Everything we're doing...

03:37.050 --> 03:38.343
that's over.

03:40.012 --> 03:43.182
They'll cancel the program.
It's just a matter of time.

04:13.003 --> 04:14.129
Hey.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.178
They're tuckered out.

04:21.887 --> 04:24.431
Yeah. I read them this.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.601
Out like a light.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.316
How was the service?

04:38.320 --> 04:39.613
You all right?

04:42.991 --> 04:44.159
Yeah.

04:49.331 --> 04:51.583
Sometimes, I...

04:56.046 --> 04:59.466
I just wonder if I'm doing right
by these boys.

05:00.217 --> 05:01.301
Hey...

05:04.555 --> 05:06.765
these boys think you hung the moon.

05:09.935 --> 05:13.564
How many moms do you know
that are training to go into outer space

05:14.064 --> 05:18.026
and still find time to help their kids
do their homework in the morning?

05:20.070 --> 05:21.196
You didn't do it?

05:21.822 --> 05:22.823
Nope.

05:31.373 --> 05:32.708
I love you.

05:33.542 --> 05:34.710
I love you too.

05:40.632 --> 05:43.343
No, sir. I was her instructor that day.

05:43.427 --> 05:46.096
I just didn't get a chance
to talk to you at the funeral and--

05:50.100 --> 05:52.019
If there is anyone to--

05:54.021 --> 05:57.024
I just want to express to you--

05:58.984 --> 06:02.112
-No, no, sir--
-<i>Because they're afraid...</i>

06:03.697 --> 06:05.616
Sorry, sir. Just listen to me. I--

06:08.076 --> 06:10.037
I understand your feelings.

06:10.120 --> 06:13.498
No, that's not at all what I'm--
Sir? Mr. Doyle.

06:38.857 --> 06:39.942
Sorry.

06:42.486 --> 06:43.695
Forget about it.

06:44.988 --> 06:46.490
It's just a phone.

06:46.573 --> 06:49.076
He just wouldn't listen.

06:49.159 --> 06:51.203
Sometimes when people are grieving,

06:51.286 --> 06:53.622
the last thing they wanna hear
is an explanation.

06:55.207 --> 06:56.625
Well, he had every right.

06:56.708 --> 06:58.418
Ed, this wasn't your fault, okay?

06:58.502 --> 07:00.212
I was her instructor.

07:00.295 --> 07:02.130
It was my job to prepare her.

07:04.007 --> 07:05.592
Make sure she was ready.

07:08.303 --> 07:09.304
And I failed.

07:09.388 --> 07:13.141
You can't keep blaming yourself
for everything that goes wrong.

07:13.225 --> 07:14.852
She knew the risks, all right?

07:14.935 --> 07:16.812
She'd been flying for years.

07:16.895 --> 07:20.482
She knew-- Hey, hey, stop. Stop.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.028
Go mow the lawn.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.156
Ed!

07:49.052 --> 07:50.345
This really isn't necessary.

07:50.429 --> 07:52.764
I'm pretty sure I can
still find my way around here.

07:53.724 --> 07:55.809
It's no bother, Mr. Glenn.

07:58.562 --> 07:59.855
That's John Glenn.

07:59.938 --> 08:03.400
Look at old Gus. And Scott. Good grief.

08:04.193 --> 08:06.695
We sure thought the world of ourselves
back then, didn't we?

08:06.778 --> 08:08.947
Yeah. Full of piss and vinegar.

08:09.698 --> 08:12.117
-Guess nothing's changed, huh?
-Yeah.

08:13.285 --> 08:14.411
Nice tie.

08:15.704 --> 08:16.997
All right.

08:17.414 --> 08:19.082
So, what's on your mind?

08:19.541 --> 08:22.920
Well, the girl that crashed the bedstead.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.546
Patricia Doyle.

08:24.630 --> 08:26.757
She was out of her depth.

08:28.258 --> 08:29.343
What makes you say that?

08:30.511 --> 08:34.765
There's a reason that being a test pilot
used to be a requirement for this job.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.392
Experience actually matters.

08:38.519 --> 08:40.604
You have to face the facts, Deke.

08:40.687 --> 08:43.690
Men go off and fight the wars
and fly the planes.

08:43.774 --> 08:45.359
Women can't do what we do.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.819
It's just a fact of our social order.

08:47.903 --> 08:51.031
I don't know if you heard,
but a woman did land on the moon.

08:51.114 --> 08:53.367
They've worked hard for this, John.

08:53.450 --> 08:54.952
To take it away from them now...

08:55.035 --> 08:59.164
Look, after what you went through
on Mercury...

09:00.832 --> 09:03.752
I don't blame you for having compassion
for these ladies, I really don't.

09:03.836 --> 09:05.379
This has nothing to do with that.

09:05.462 --> 09:07.798
Deke, I've known you for a long time.

09:08.841 --> 09:12.135
I was there when that moron flight surgeon
grounded you for...

09:12.219 --> 09:13.428
What'd they call it?

09:14.012 --> 09:15.430
Atrial fibrillation.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.474
You got a raw deal.

09:18.100 --> 09:20.644
We're talking about
the credibility of NASA here.

09:21.645 --> 09:24.690
Everyone knows this wasn't your idea.
It was forced on you.

09:24.773 --> 09:27.609
Nobody forced me into anything.

09:28.193 --> 09:31.530
I decide who goes up and who doesn't.

09:31.613 --> 09:32.614
I know.

09:33.115 --> 09:35.075
And your word carries a lot of weight.

09:36.660 --> 09:39.288
If you come out and say
that we gave it a good shot

09:39.371 --> 09:41.540
and these girls
just weren't up to standards,

09:42.165 --> 09:43.667
no one's gonna question that.

09:44.459 --> 09:45.544
No one.

09:47.838 --> 09:49.298
We don't know what caused the crash,

09:49.381 --> 09:53.886
but we are fairly certain
that they lost at least one cosmonaut.

09:54.720 --> 09:57.556
So, a man died on the moon,
and they're keeping it quiet.

09:58.682 --> 10:01.226
Russians don't like
to publicize their failures.

10:01.310 --> 10:02.352
Unlike us.

10:02.436 --> 10:05.105
That's the price you pay
for living in a free society, Gordo.

10:06.064 --> 10:09.818
This is the best view Orbiter Six
could get of the impact crater.

10:10.444 --> 10:12.863
The concern is that,
with their trajectory,

10:12.946 --> 10:16.325
they might've been attempting
to land near a possible water site.

10:16.408 --> 10:19.161
So it looks like they know
what might be up there, same as us.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.043
What are those cylinders?

10:26.835 --> 10:31.423
Guys at JPL think that
they might be pressurized modules.

10:31.507 --> 10:33.300
As in habitation modules?

10:34.009 --> 10:35.093
Yes.

10:35.177 --> 10:36.595
-Shit.
-Jesus.

10:36.678 --> 10:38.055
They're ahead of us. Again.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.515
We need to accelerate the base.

10:39.598 --> 10:41.308
They get a foothold up there before we do,

10:41.391 --> 10:45.187
they could start putting in
missile radar systems, surveillance...

10:45.270 --> 10:48.899
We're behind schedule now.
We don't even have a site selected yet.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.109
Why the hell not? Just pick one.

10:51.193 --> 10:54.780
Sir, the base designs have been predicated
on proximity to water ice.

10:54.863 --> 10:56.823
If we don't have that,
we don't have a base,

10:56.907 --> 10:59.243
-and we have yet to identify where--
-And who are you again?

11:03.372 --> 11:05.290
I'm Margo Madison, sir.

11:05.374 --> 11:07.793
Right. You're Wernher's girl.

11:07.876 --> 11:09.920
She's a flight dynamics officer.

11:10.337 --> 11:11.964
And she makes a good point.

11:12.047 --> 11:14.216
We can't just throw a dart
and land anywhere.

11:14.299 --> 11:15.968
I don't give a shit where it is.

11:16.051 --> 11:19.304
I don't care if it's a tent and a campfire
as long as we can say we were first.

11:19.388 --> 11:20.681
We need a win.

11:21.431 --> 11:24.226
Sputnik. Gagarin. Leonov. Belikova.

11:24.309 --> 11:27.855
The president's not interested
in another second-place finish.

11:28.939 --> 11:32.442
It's bad enough that our girl's accident
is plastered all over the news.

11:32.526 --> 11:34.611
We have an election coming up,

11:35.404 --> 11:38.073
and the way it looks, it's probably
gonna be against Ted Kennedy.

11:38.490 --> 11:40.284
Should be a nice, clean fight.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.536
The president wants to give
the American people

11:42.619 --> 11:43.954
something to cheer about.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.747
A Kennedy landslide.

11:46.123 --> 11:50.627
Laugh all you want, but Nixon's
the only reason this program still exists.

11:51.837 --> 11:54.840
Apollo 15 will locate a usable site.

11:54.923 --> 11:57.092
And the president will announce
that mankind's first

11:57.176 --> 12:01.430
permanently manned base on the moon
will be flying the star-spangled banner.

12:03.182 --> 12:06.852
Congratulations, gentlemen,
you're going to make history.

12:08.103 --> 12:11.398
<i>...have concluded an agreement
to end the war</i>

12:11.481 --> 12:15.527
<i>and bring peace with honor
in Vietnam and in Southeast Asia.</i>

12:16.320 --> 12:21.033
<i>The cease-fire will take effect
at 2400 Greenwich Mean Time,</i>

12:21.116 --> 12:23.243
<i>November 16th, 1970.</i>

12:23.869 --> 12:26.914
<i>The United States
and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam</i>

12:26.997 --> 12:31.210
<i>express the hope that this agreement
will ensure stable peace in Vietnam</i>

12:31.293 --> 12:32.419
<i>and contribute to the preservation--</i>

12:32.836 --> 12:34.004
Got a minute?

12:34.087 --> 12:35.380
Sure, sit down.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.887
Got you an early birthday present.

12:43.514 --> 12:44.681
What is it?

12:45.516 --> 12:48.769
-He's pulling the plug.
-Yeah, I know. I'm watching it now.

12:48.852 --> 12:51.230
No. Not Vietnam. The other thing.

12:53.357 --> 12:54.358
Now?

12:55.692 --> 12:57.402
They're almost done with the training.

12:57.486 --> 12:59.613
The peace treaty is the perfect cover.

12:59.696 --> 13:01.949
Give everybody something shiny to look at.

13:03.367 --> 13:04.660
I thought you'd be happy.

13:05.202 --> 13:08.705
I'm tired of being jerked around
is what I am.

13:09.665 --> 13:12.960
You have any idea how hard I've been
working to get these women ready?

13:13.502 --> 13:18.298
They have been busting their butts
doing every goddamn thing I ask.

13:18.382 --> 13:20.384
Well, he's seen the light.

13:20.467 --> 13:21.593
What can I say?

13:21.677 --> 13:24.346
With the Soviets on our heels,
he doesn't want any distractions.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.140
And the polling didn't help.

13:27.808 --> 13:31.770
Turns out Americans don't really wanna
watch women dying in fiery plane crashes.

13:35.941 --> 13:38.193
Look, the circus is over.

13:38.694 --> 13:44.533
Now you can put all your focus
back on the lunar base, where it belongs.

14:14.271 --> 14:16.481
Hey, what's with the press conference?

14:16.565 --> 14:18.567
I was just coming to ask you.
You didn't call it?

14:18.650 --> 14:19.943
I thought you called it.

14:21.570 --> 14:25.199
These women are the first
to successfully complete

14:25.282 --> 14:27.326
all of NASA's required training.

14:28.869 --> 14:32.789
And so, now it is my great privilege
to introduce to you...

14:33.874 --> 14:35.626
Holy shit.

14:37.419 --> 14:38.545
Tracy Stevens.

14:46.386 --> 14:47.387
Molly Cobb.

14:55.938 --> 14:57.147
Ellen Waverly.

15:04.780 --> 15:05.864
Danielle Poole.

15:15.624 --> 15:18.710
Ladies and gentlemen,
America's next Apollo astronauts.

15:33.225 --> 15:34.601
I did not authorize this.

15:34.685 --> 15:36.353
I know. I did.

15:36.979 --> 15:40.524
I say who's an astronaut.
Who goes up and when.

15:42.109 --> 15:44.194
Well, congratulations.

15:45.279 --> 15:47.281
You just made Nixon's shitlist.

15:47.364 --> 15:48.532
Any questions?

16:25.819 --> 16:26.945
<i>Molly Cobb.</i>

16:29.573 --> 16:32.409
Aleida, did you see?

16:33.577 --> 16:36.455
-Yes. Papa, look.
-<i>Ellen Waverly.</i>

16:36.538 --> 16:40.626
Well... look what I got for you.

16:40.709 --> 16:41.877
What is it?

16:44.755 --> 16:45.964
<i>Danielle Poole.</i>

16:55.557 --> 16:58.769
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
America's next Apollo astronauts.</i>

17:13.784 --> 17:16.703
<i>A truly historic day in the space program.</i>

17:16.787 --> 17:18.579
<i>No word yet on which of the new astronauts</i>

17:18.664 --> 17:21.124
<i>will be the first American woman
to go to the moon.</i>

17:21.750 --> 17:23.502
<i>In other news, the Nixon administration</i>

17:23.585 --> 17:26.672
<i>continues the drawdown
of US forces in Vietnam,</i>

17:26.755 --> 17:29.341
<i>as another
three battalions return home tomorrow.</i>

17:29.424 --> 17:31.760
<i>Please stand by
while we patch you through to Da Nang.</i>

17:33.011 --> 17:35.556
<i>Go for Da Nang. Connecting with Da Nang.</i>

17:35.639 --> 17:38.267
<i>Hello? Dani? You there?</i>

17:38.350 --> 17:39.393
Clayton?

17:40.227 --> 17:43.146
<i>Hey, baby. Can barely hear you.</i>

17:45.607 --> 17:46.608
Clay?

17:46.692 --> 17:48.151
<i>There you go. Now I got you.</i>

17:48.569 --> 17:50.529
<i>Hey, guess what?</i>

17:51.363 --> 17:54.116
<i>One of the guys painted a spaceman
on my helmet.</i>

17:54.199 --> 17:55.659
<i>They're calling me Major Tom.</i>

18:00.581 --> 18:02.457
It is so good to hear your voice.

18:04.168 --> 18:05.210
I miss you.

18:07.254 --> 18:10.632
Every night on the news
I see more and more soldiers coming home.

18:12.259 --> 18:13.594
It's almost over.

18:14.344 --> 18:16.972
<i>Yeah. Almost.</i>

18:19.183 --> 18:21.185
Baby, you won't believe
what happened today.

18:22.269 --> 18:24.146
I can barely believe it myself.

18:24.229 --> 18:27.691
<i>Don't keep me in-- I wanna-- about it--</i>

18:28.859 --> 18:29.860
Clay?

18:29.943 --> 18:34.406
<i>Can't-- again-- These goddamn--</i>

18:35.115 --> 18:37.326
Clay? What?

18:38.660 --> 18:40.370
-I can't hear you.
-<i>Babe--</i>

18:41.205 --> 18:42.497
Clay, where are you?

18:44.208 --> 18:45.209
Clay?

18:47.711 --> 18:48.712
Clay?

18:51.757 --> 18:52.841
Hey, keep your eyes--

18:55.135 --> 18:57.095
No. You're getting the hang of it.

18:57.179 --> 18:59.556
It just takes a few tries, that's all.

18:59.640 --> 19:01.099
-All right, on your feet.
-Yes, sir.

19:04.645 --> 19:07.022
Now, keep your weight forward, okay?

19:08.482 --> 19:10.400
Not that much. Not-- That's better.

19:10.484 --> 19:11.902
Now, stop looking at the ground.

19:13.946 --> 19:17.449
Damn it. Now, you didn't do
what I told you, Shane, did ya?

19:17.908 --> 19:19.743
-No, sir.
-You need to listen to me.

19:20.869 --> 19:22.746
-Sorry.
-Don't apologize.

19:23.664 --> 19:25.832
Okay. Look at me. Do not apologize.

19:27.918 --> 19:29.378
Just listen to me, okay?

19:29.461 --> 19:31.255
Hey. I don't wanna see that.

19:31.338 --> 19:33.465
Now, you get up on this bike,
and you try again, okay?

19:33.549 --> 19:35.676
And you've gotta follow my instructions.

19:37.302 --> 19:39.304
Hey, I need to talk to Mr. Slayton.

19:39.388 --> 19:40.806
So, we'll continue this tomorrow.

19:51.525 --> 19:52.526
Deke.

20:18.468 --> 20:20.387
I'm making a change in your crew.

20:21.722 --> 20:22.931
Gordo's out.

20:23.849 --> 20:25.058
Shit.

20:28.604 --> 20:30.814
-What'd he do now?
-It's not that.

20:31.690 --> 20:34.026
Your new LEM pilot
will be one of the new astronauts.

20:34.109 --> 20:35.652
One of the female astronauts.

20:38.030 --> 20:39.323
You're kidding me.

20:42.326 --> 20:44.328
You put him on 15, Deke.

20:46.121 --> 20:47.748
He's been up there with me twice before

20:47.831 --> 20:49.875
and training with me every day
for the past nine months.

20:49.958 --> 20:52.544
And he's the best goddamn LEM pilot
we have in the program.

20:52.628 --> 20:55.380
These women can fly.
You've seen what they're capable of.

20:55.464 --> 20:57.966
Come on, Deke. This is a publicity stunt.

20:58.717 --> 21:01.053
All due respect, Karen,
this is my decision.

21:01.136 --> 21:03.847
Well, then I understand it even less.
You're rushing into this.

21:03.931 --> 21:05.307
-You're gonna make a mistake.
-Karen.

21:08.268 --> 21:10.312
Look, they need more training.

21:11.897 --> 21:13.774
They're not ready, Deke. Not for 15.

21:13.857 --> 21:14.858
I disagree.

21:15.609 --> 21:17.528
They've all earned their place
in this program.

21:17.611 --> 21:19.738
And I say they're ready to fly.

21:19.821 --> 21:21.782
That's easy to say
when you're not going up there.

21:24.952 --> 21:26.870
You don't want the flight, say the words.

21:27.788 --> 21:30.040
You can get drunk
and watch it on TV with Gordo

21:30.123 --> 21:32.000
and bitch about how unfair the world is.

21:32.084 --> 21:33.335
You won't see me there.

21:36.338 --> 21:37.673
So, you want the flight or not?

21:41.051 --> 21:42.427
Yeah, I want the--

21:43.345 --> 21:44.429
Good.

21:50.435 --> 21:53.188
Oh, shit. Should I go talk to her?

21:54.439 --> 21:56.650
Not if you wanna walk out of here alive.

21:58.819 --> 22:00.487
I'll break the news to Gordo.

22:00.988 --> 22:02.406
Already done.

22:02.781 --> 22:04.700
It was my call. My responsibility.

22:05.284 --> 22:07.703
-How'd he take it?
-About the same way she did.

22:09.371 --> 22:12.165
You should have dinner with your
new crewmate tonight, you and Sedge.

22:13.083 --> 22:16.795
Have a couple drinks. Break bread.
Get to know each other a little.

22:19.006 --> 22:20.215
Great.

22:21.925 --> 22:23.802
So, who's the lucky lady?

22:26.346 --> 22:30.017
You know,
a lot of eyes are gonna be on you now.

22:30.100 --> 22:31.977
A lot of expectations.

22:33.478 --> 22:35.314
You just gotta
put all that out of your mind.

22:35.397 --> 22:38.775
You just, you know, focus on the mission.
It's the only thing that matters.

22:38.859 --> 22:40.652
And, you know, remember,
it's not all on you.

22:40.736 --> 22:41.904
You know, we're a crew.

22:41.987 --> 22:43.906
That's right. We're 15.

22:45.032 --> 22:47.409
Just the three of us.
We rely on each other.

22:47.910 --> 22:50.078
-Damn right.
-Could you pass the A1, please?

22:53.248 --> 22:55.042
And it's gonna be
your first time in space.

22:55.876 --> 22:57.461
Everybody understands that.

23:00.380 --> 23:02.841
It's gonna be
your first time in space too, right?

23:02.925 --> 23:04.092
Uh-huh.

23:04.176 --> 23:06.470
Old Sedgey used to fly Phantoms in Nam.

23:06.553 --> 23:08.514
He's been flying jets
ever since the Air Force Academy,

23:08.597 --> 23:10.265
but we won't hold that against him.

23:10.349 --> 23:11.600
Go Falcons.

23:11.683 --> 23:13.352
You know,
you guys gotta try the baked potato.

23:13.810 --> 23:16.063
-It's outstanding.
-Fantastic.

23:16.146 --> 23:19.733
You know-- I guess
what I'm really trying to get to--

23:19.816 --> 23:21.443
Yep. Please, get to it.

23:24.154 --> 23:25.447
I'm trying to get to it--

23:25.531 --> 23:28.909
You know, between me and Sedgey, we've got
a lot of experience under our belts.

23:28.992 --> 23:32.037
So if you just follow our lead,

23:32.996 --> 23:35.040
you won't have anything to worry about.

23:36.959 --> 23:39.878
-I'm not worried.
-Good.

23:40.504 --> 23:42.965
I've actually been flying
longer than either of you.

23:43.674 --> 23:48.345
In fact, I was in Mercury 13
before you got into Gemini.

23:48.428 --> 23:50.013
So, in a sense,

23:50.597 --> 23:52.224
I have seniority here.

23:53.934 --> 23:54.935
Isn't that funny?

23:58.480 --> 23:59.940
Yeah, this is good.

24:49.573 --> 24:50.741
There you are.

24:53.368 --> 24:55.913
Where have you been?
Dinner's in half an hour.

24:55.996 --> 24:58.874
And Fred and Susie are probably
already on their way over.

25:00.626 --> 25:02.377
Sorry. Just...

25:03.086 --> 25:05.380
a couple things come up at the office.

25:09.551 --> 25:10.552
Are you...

25:16.558 --> 25:18.018
Jesus Christ.

25:19.895 --> 25:21.104
You're drunk.

25:22.523 --> 25:25.067
You're just not gonna
let me enjoy this, are you?

25:25.150 --> 25:28.695
I'm sorry, Trace. I just...

25:29.863 --> 25:31.114
What, Gordo?

25:32.074 --> 25:33.200
What?

25:39.373 --> 25:40.916
I'm off 15.

25:42.543 --> 25:44.378
Deke replaced me with Molly Cobb.

25:45.754 --> 25:47.130
She's taking my ride.

25:49.883 --> 25:51.176
Honey.

25:51.260 --> 25:53.220
So, she gets the moon,

25:54.471 --> 25:57.766
and I get... shit.

26:03.564 --> 26:04.857
I'm so sorry.

26:09.027 --> 26:11.613
Hey, you know what?
I'm gonna tell Sheila to go home

26:11.697 --> 26:13.448
-and you just--
-Hey, no. No.

26:14.825 --> 26:19.329
No. No, we're celebrating you tonight.

26:19.413 --> 26:21.456
-Are you sure?
-Damn straight.

26:21.540 --> 26:24.209
Another Stevens is an astronaut.

26:24.293 --> 26:26.879
I mean, that demands a celebration.

26:26.962 --> 26:29.464
In fact, I'm gonna call Jim Rathmann.

26:30.048 --> 26:31.675
Next week, you and me will go down there,

26:31.758 --> 26:35.095
we're gonna pick out
a brand-new Vette for you.

26:37.431 --> 26:38.932
I can't go next week.

26:40.142 --> 26:41.435
Why not?

26:42.060 --> 26:43.896
They're sending me out to the Cape
to help prep.

26:47.691 --> 26:48.859
For how long?

26:49.568 --> 26:51.528
A week. Maybe a little longer.

26:51.612 --> 26:52.654
A week?

26:54.406 --> 26:55.782
I mean, well--

26:57.284 --> 27:00.037
Shouldn't we, like,
talk through that stuff

27:00.120 --> 27:02.789
before you just agree
to run off and go to Florida?

27:04.291 --> 27:06.585
Well, that's not how this works, Gordo.
You know that.

27:08.837 --> 27:11.048
I go where I'm told, just like you.

27:38.200 --> 27:39.910
Hey, Molly's getting 15.

27:39.993 --> 27:41.286
She is.

27:41.370 --> 27:43.747
And I'm not exactly
supposed to tell you this,

27:43.830 --> 27:47.417
but word is you're gonna be her backup.

27:52.047 --> 27:53.757
She's the best pilot in our class.

27:53.841 --> 27:56.134
Plus, she thrives under pressure.

27:56.218 --> 27:57.886
Half the time
I think she tries to create it.

27:57.970 --> 28:02.057
Well, Baldwin doesn't put up
with any shit and Molly loves a shitstorm,

28:02.933 --> 28:05.310
which means you have a real shot
at getting bumped up.

28:05.811 --> 28:09.273
Just keep on doing what you do.
And keep your nose clean.

28:14.611 --> 28:18.031
Well, here's to the first American woman
on the moon.

28:18.115 --> 28:19.491
Whoever she may be.

28:24.621 --> 28:26.123
-I got the next round.
-Thank you.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.001
Please.

28:29.585 --> 28:32.754
So, when do you get off work?

28:34.339 --> 28:35.799
Not soon enough.

28:36.842 --> 28:38.135
-Can we have another round?
-Yeah.

28:40.137 --> 28:41.597
-Hi.
-Hello.

28:42.681 --> 28:44.016
-Bourbon for-- Yeah.
-Sure.

28:46.977 --> 28:48.854
You and lady astronaut over there

28:48.937 --> 28:51.565
have been spending
an awful lot of time together lately.

28:52.482 --> 28:54.234
Yeah, I'd make a move
while you still can, Lar.

28:55.068 --> 28:58.238
I mean, chick like that
won't be on the market long.

28:58.322 --> 29:03.327
And I bet that astronaut tail...
it's outta this world.

29:14.421 --> 29:16.673
And I was nice to her the whole time.

29:17.257 --> 29:19.760
Offered to help her out,
show her the ropes.

29:20.761 --> 29:23.388
And all she gave me was attitude. Like--

29:24.264 --> 29:26.767
She acted like
she's already been up there before.

29:28.602 --> 29:29.686
What?

29:31.772 --> 29:32.814
I don't know.

29:34.441 --> 29:36.527
You know, I don't think she likes men.

29:37.277 --> 29:39.363
-You know what I mean?
-What? Hey, no.

29:39.446 --> 29:41.406
-You just brushed your teeth.
-It's like Listerine.

29:41.490 --> 29:44.076
-Okay. Yeah?
-Yeah.

29:44.660 --> 29:45.702
Great.

29:57.714 --> 30:00.384
He does not respect women,

30:01.176 --> 30:03.095
that's for damn sure.

30:10.435 --> 30:12.187
He probably thinks I'm a lesbian.

30:17.860 --> 30:20.028
I've often thought of myself as a lesbian.

30:22.281 --> 30:24.616
He was so goddamn patronizing.

30:27.160 --> 30:29.621
Telling me that I shouldn't worry

30:30.372 --> 30:33.876
because they would be there
to hold my hand.

30:36.336 --> 30:38.547
It sounds like
he doesn't know you very well.

30:39.173 --> 30:41.258
Yeah, well, why would he?

30:45.804 --> 30:50.142
I mean, we are invisible
to the "real astronauts."

30:54.521 --> 30:56.398
He thinks this program's a joke.

31:02.863 --> 31:05.782
It's just ridiculous.
I don't know why you agreed to it.

31:05.866 --> 31:08.410
It's not gonna help with everything
that happened with Patty.

31:08.493 --> 31:11.079
Look, it's not about that, okay?

31:13.832 --> 31:15.417
Deke's got final say on the crew.

31:15.959 --> 31:17.628
-Yeah, but--
-You heard him. I'd be off 15.

31:17.711 --> 31:19.796
Okay, well, then there's other missions.

31:19.880 --> 31:21.757
Not if I say no to this one.

31:21.840 --> 31:23.300
Well, she's not up to snuff.

31:24.843 --> 31:27.012
That ship has sailed.

31:27.095 --> 31:30.390
She's on my crew,
and I gotta make it work.

31:33.477 --> 31:35.562
I just gotta make sure
she doesn't screw up.

31:40.108 --> 31:42.528
Maybe I was just meant to fly solo.

31:44.738 --> 31:46.573
Are you trying to hurt my feelings?

31:48.033 --> 31:49.117
I don't mean that.

31:52.037 --> 31:55.249
What happens
if you can't find it within yourself

31:55.332 --> 31:57.209
to play nice with this guy?

32:01.380 --> 32:03.006
I guess he could just bounce me.

32:05.300 --> 32:08.262
What do you think
Patty would think about that?

32:12.015 --> 32:15.519
That I was being an idiot, as usual.

32:16.311 --> 32:21.066
Yeah. Look, I know you know
how to be a part of a team.

32:24.945 --> 32:26.113
Would you...

32:27.281 --> 32:31.076
be up for some team-building exercises?

32:31.159 --> 32:32.703
Well, you seem to be.

33:12.284 --> 33:14.620
-Hello?
-<i>Mornin', Lar. It's Coop.</i>

33:14.703 --> 33:17.039
<i>So, the training schedule
for the prime crew just shifted up,</i>

33:17.122 --> 33:19.750
<i>and we're gonna need Ellen
in the sim at 0600.</i>

33:19.833 --> 33:20.834
Ellen?

33:20.918 --> 33:23.212
<i>Well, we called her place,
but there was no answer.</i>

33:23.295 --> 33:25.506
<i>So I figured maybe she was with you?</i>

33:27.758 --> 33:31.136
Yeah. Yeah, she's still asleep.

33:31.970 --> 33:35.349
I'll get her there on time, okay?
Just keep this on the QT, will ya?

33:35.432 --> 33:38.560
<i>Don't worry about it.
See you in the sim, you hound dog.</i>

34:02.543 --> 34:05.087
-Hello?
-<i>Pam? It's Larry Wilson.</i>

34:05.170 --> 34:08.005
-Larry? What are you--
-<i>Just tell her to get dressed.</i>

34:08.090 --> 34:09.550
<i>I'll be there in 20 minutes.</i>

34:18.266 --> 34:19.768
Who was that?

34:19.851 --> 34:22.938
It's Larry. He'll be here in 20 minutes.

34:40.706 --> 34:45.668
I guess I had one too many
last night at the Outpost,

34:45.752 --> 34:49.547
and Pam just thought it was better
if I didn't drive.

34:49.630 --> 34:52.134
And her house is closer,
spare couch and all, so...

34:55.387 --> 34:56.929
It's not like I was on the clock.
I was just--

34:57.014 --> 34:59.057
The two of you are getting sloppy.

35:03.562 --> 35:05.731
I'm not sure-- I don't know--

35:07.774 --> 35:08.942
What are you talking about?

35:09.026 --> 35:10.527
You used to be more careful.

35:11.987 --> 35:13.572
I thought you had your act together.

35:17.993 --> 35:19.369
Have you been spying on me?

35:19.453 --> 35:20.454
You don't have to listen to me.

35:20.537 --> 35:23.248
But if the bosses find out
that you've been lying about anything,

35:23.707 --> 35:24.833
they'll interpret it to mean

35:24.917 --> 35:27.002
that you could lie about something
during a mission.

35:28.086 --> 35:29.963
Like to cover up a mistake.

35:30.672 --> 35:33.050
And from that moment on,
they will put you under the microscope

35:33.133 --> 35:35.427
and they will never, ever let you fly.

35:35.511 --> 35:37.846
-You're overreacting.
-You have to be smarter than this.

35:38.263 --> 35:40.516
Smarter than everyone else,
or you're done.

35:46.271 --> 35:47.731
Believe me, I know.

35:54.363 --> 35:56.114
When we walk into that office,

35:56.740 --> 35:59.284
just act the way they're expecting us to.

36:03.080 --> 36:04.915
If you can pull that off, you'll be fine.

36:10.963 --> 36:11.964
You'll be fine.

37:13.525 --> 37:16.236
All right, everyone.
We're going to the moon. Smile.

37:18.572 --> 37:22.075
Jesus, it's the mopesy twins.
Give us a little more.

37:22.159 --> 37:25.662
You're gonna find ice on the moon
and inspire people all over the world!

37:27.623 --> 37:31.001
Okay, let's get one with just Molly.

37:31.793 --> 37:33.837
Gentlemen, just Molly, please. Thank you.

37:35.589 --> 37:37.716
Molly, could you fluff your hair a bit?

37:40.010 --> 37:43.138
Yeah, that's not working. Can we
get a little help, please? Thank you.

37:43.222 --> 37:45.098
Nixon loves long hair.

37:45.182 --> 37:46.725
That ship has sailed.

37:46.808 --> 37:47.976
Listen, Molly.

37:48.393 --> 37:50.771
Americans wanna see
a free woman on the moon.

37:50.854 --> 37:53.482
Not some Soviet puppet. So, try to smile.

37:53.565 --> 37:57.486
You know, Anastasia's look
beckons us into the cosmos.

37:57.569 --> 37:59.029
You just said she was a puppet.

37:59.821 --> 38:01.532
You need to beckon America.

38:02.533 --> 38:03.784
Askew.

38:07.246 --> 38:08.497
Smile.

38:11.291 --> 38:12.376
Maybe don't smile.

38:14.503 --> 38:15.712
I think we're done.

40:57.082 --> 40:58.584
Well, I'll be a son of a bitch.

40:58.667 --> 41:02.045
Look at you.
Finally, a side of you I like.

41:02.796 --> 41:04.047
You play here a lot?

41:04.506 --> 41:06.842
I don't know. Sometimes.

41:07.384 --> 41:10.179
I guess it helps clear my head
before a launch.

41:10.804 --> 41:12.931
You had a real nice groove going there.

41:13.599 --> 41:15.142
This is my husband, Wayne.

41:17.144 --> 41:18.353
You're married?

41:18.812 --> 41:20.230
It's nice to meet you.

41:20.314 --> 41:21.815
I gotta get the girls down here.

41:21.899 --> 41:23.358
Don't tell anyone.

41:23.442 --> 41:26.612
This is my own time.
It's no one's business but mine.

41:26.695 --> 41:27.696
Whoa. Relax.

41:27.779 --> 41:29.156
I'm serious.

41:29.239 --> 41:31.116
You don't wanna mess with me, Molly.

41:31.200 --> 41:32.743
-Got it?
-I got it.

41:34.328 --> 41:35.537
Nice to meet you, Wayne.

41:54.598 --> 41:57.226
You can't just use your wrist.

41:58.310 --> 42:03.148
In your suit, if you wanna get to the ice,
you need to use your whole arm, okay?

42:03.232 --> 42:04.233
Right.

42:11.532 --> 42:13.617
You can't just pick it up.

42:14.910 --> 42:18.914
You bend in your suit, you can't get
further than 22 inches off the ground.

42:19.331 --> 42:20.874
Let's just leave it for now.

42:20.958 --> 42:23.919
Just focus
on these sample bags, okay?

42:27.339 --> 42:29.508
Get your own bag. They're over there.

42:29.591 --> 42:31.343
Jesus Christ.

43:02.875 --> 43:03.876
Arm down.

43:11.216 --> 43:12.301
This zipper, man.

43:14.052 --> 43:15.721
-You got that?
-Yeah, I got it.

43:16.346 --> 43:19.683
<i>Well, at least
I won't have to wear a bra in space.</i>

43:20.100 --> 43:21.518
<i>Zero-G and all.</i>

43:21.602 --> 43:24.062
Speaking on behalf of Ed and myself,

43:24.146 --> 43:27.065
in the interest
of our respective marriages, please do.

43:30.027 --> 43:31.236
Is there a problem?

43:31.862 --> 43:36.200
Well, we just realized
the relief tube was designed for...

43:38.160 --> 43:39.411
man parts.

43:40.078 --> 43:43.040
She won't be able to use it. I mean,
not without making a hell of a mess.

43:43.624 --> 43:45.876
Let's see. The trip takes, what? A week?

43:46.418 --> 43:48.879
Yeah, I don't think
I can hold it that long.

43:48.962 --> 43:50.255
She could wear a diaper.

43:50.714 --> 43:52.382
Worked for the guys on Gemini.

43:52.466 --> 43:54.301
Molly. Does that sound okay to you?

43:54.384 --> 43:56.970
I'm sorry. Are you kidding? What?

43:58.347 --> 43:59.598
Let me handle this.

44:00.766 --> 44:04.186
No one on my crew is going to the moon
in a damn diaper.

44:05.062 --> 44:08.023
This is NASA.
You're rocket scientists. Figure it out.

44:09.858 --> 44:11.151
It's just a diaper.

44:12.986 --> 44:15.614
So, once you figure out
the controls of the rover...

44:16.907 --> 44:18.492
we'll bring in the 1/6th-g rig

44:18.575 --> 44:20.744
to better simulate its movements
on the moon.

44:22.204 --> 44:25.791
See, the trick is
to keep your eyes on the road.

44:27.501 --> 44:30.671
I'm pretty sure I learned that
in driver's ed... sir.

44:34.675 --> 44:38.136
What I meant is, you're a pilot.

44:39.221 --> 44:40.806
All pilots have tendencies, see?

44:40.889 --> 44:42.266
Every time Gordo drives this thing,

44:42.349 --> 44:45.561
he keeps checking that instrument panel
and then he cross-checks his surrounding,

44:45.644 --> 44:47.813
looking out through the window
like he's in an airplane.

44:47.896 --> 44:48.897
Don't do that.

44:49.606 --> 44:51.650
The terrain's gonna be very irregular,

44:52.442 --> 44:55.320
and even at eight kilometers an hour,
things can happen quick.

44:56.321 --> 44:57.447
Okay?

44:57.865 --> 44:58.866
Got it.

45:07.040 --> 45:09.960
Cobb,
you went into final trim 30 seconds late.

45:15.841 --> 45:18.093
She still doesn't know these procedures.

45:19.052 --> 45:20.846
Let's run it again. Reset.

45:21.305 --> 45:22.556
Roger that.

45:22.639 --> 45:24.224
She is such a pain in my ass.

45:25.225 --> 45:26.852
Resetting to P63.

45:27.811 --> 45:28.854
You know I got this, right?

45:29.188 --> 45:31.815
I was just adjusting
the locking harness out of the way.

45:31.899 --> 45:34.193
<i>And stick to the procedure this time,
Cobb.</i>

45:34.276 --> 45:35.277
Yeah.

45:49.750 --> 45:53.462
Can we... focus, here?

45:53.545 --> 45:57.174
Okay. Noun six two, enter.

45:57.633 --> 46:00.177
Verb two one, enter.

46:00.260 --> 46:02.888
Noun zero one, enter.

46:03.514 --> 46:06.266
Two zero one zero, enter.

46:06.892 --> 46:09.269
Two zero six, enter.

46:10.938 --> 46:13.815
Oh, shit. That was supposed to be
two zero seven, right?

46:14.608 --> 46:15.609
Yep.

46:15.692 --> 46:17.027
<i>All right, let's reset again.</i>

46:19.738 --> 46:21.031
Belay that.

46:22.032 --> 46:24.826
I think we need to rework the procedure
for this stage of the mission.

46:26.161 --> 46:29.164
I'll handle the DSKY entries
until we're in P66.

46:29.248 --> 46:31.875
And I'll actuate the manual throttle
to full on my side.

46:31.959 --> 46:32.960
What? Why?

46:33.043 --> 46:35.712
That's a hell of a change
to be throwing in this late in the game.

46:35.796 --> 46:38.173
Look, Ed, I got this.
I have it under control. I just need--

46:38.257 --> 46:42.427
This is my decision. It's final. Copy?

46:44.346 --> 46:45.347
Copy.

46:45.430 --> 46:47.599
Ed, remember why we laid it out that way
in the first place?

46:47.683 --> 46:49.476
I'm the commander of this mission.

46:49.560 --> 46:54.189
If I say to change the procedure, we
change the goddamn procedure, understood?

46:55.399 --> 46:57.776
<i>Now, cut the horseshit out there
and let's get back to work.</i>

46:59.111 --> 47:01.196
Looks like Icy Ed's back in town.

47:03.866 --> 47:05.033
What was that in there?

47:05.117 --> 47:06.952
Fuck off, Margo.
I was just messing with you.

47:07.035 --> 47:11.164
You are too busy joking around in there
to see what's going on.

47:11.832 --> 47:13.250
He doesn't trust you.

47:13.917 --> 47:16.253
-What are you talking about?
-But maybe he shouldn't.

47:16.670 --> 47:20.340
Because the truth is,
you're not good enough, Molly.

47:21.133 --> 47:22.509
Not right now.

47:22.593 --> 47:24.928
And you're gonna be
the first American woman in space.

47:25.012 --> 47:27.431
You have to be perfect.

47:29.558 --> 47:31.018
I am who I am.

47:31.810 --> 47:33.645
If someone doesn't like it,
then screw them.

47:33.729 --> 47:34.980
This isn't just about you.

47:35.063 --> 47:38.150
I'm not trying to be
some goddamn role model for women.

47:38.233 --> 47:39.526
I'm just a pilot!

47:40.110 --> 47:41.195
No.

47:43.739 --> 47:45.407
You're an astronaut.

48:32.996 --> 48:34.248
-Good night.
-You too.

48:59.898 --> 49:01.775
-Keep me safe up there.
-Good luck.

49:11.159 --> 49:12.160
Hey, Ed.

49:13.537 --> 49:14.538
Gordo.

49:15.289 --> 49:16.498
Headed to the Cape.

49:17.291 --> 49:23.213
Yeah. Just one last stop off at home
to say goodbye and... off to Ellington.

49:24.798 --> 49:25.799
Look...

49:28.427 --> 49:32.264
We never got a chance to, you know...

49:33.640 --> 49:35.017
This whole deal, it's just...

49:35.100 --> 49:36.226
Yeah.

49:36.310 --> 49:38.353
Well, I mean, you'll get your... you know?

49:38.437 --> 49:41.773
It's okay, Ed. BOHICA. You know?

49:44.109 --> 49:45.402
BOHICA.

49:45.485 --> 49:46.904
Yeah.

49:46.987 --> 49:50.866
How's Karen feel about you spending a week
in a little capsule with another woman?

49:52.201 --> 49:55.579
I guarantee you she'd be a lot happier
if it was you going up there.

49:55.662 --> 49:56.663
So would I.

49:56.955 --> 50:00.209
Well, changing world.
I hope for the better.

50:00.626 --> 50:01.710
Yep.

50:02.294 --> 50:03.837
Sure it's gonna be a hell of a ride.

50:07.925 --> 50:09.218
Godspeed, 15.

50:11.428 --> 50:14.515
Well, better get back to it.
CAPCOM on the generic sim.

50:14.598 --> 50:17.684
-It's busy work.
-Right. Yeah. Busy, busy.

50:32.282 --> 50:33.367
Look at me.

50:33.450 --> 50:34.576
There you go.

50:36.828 --> 50:37.829
Yes, I see.

50:38.622 --> 50:39.998
You're doing great.

50:42.876 --> 50:44.419
But keep your feet on the pedals.

50:51.343 --> 50:55.556
<i>Attention, all passengers. Bus 163
to San Pedro has been moved to Platform C.</i>

50:55.639 --> 50:57.891
Here. This should last the whole trip.

50:58.600 --> 51:02.771
Okay, Aleida. This is the first ticket.
Now, where do you get off the bus?

51:02.855 --> 51:06.358
Cape Kennedy. It's the last stop tomorrow
morning, and I don't get off before then.

51:06.441 --> 51:09.236
Okay. And what happens
when you get to Cape Kennedy?

51:09.319 --> 51:12.406
I follow the people there because
they'll all be going to the same place.

51:12.906 --> 51:16.952
When it's over, I walk to the bus station
and use the second ticket--

51:17.035 --> 51:18.745
Papa, I need the second ticket.

51:21.123 --> 51:22.207
Sorry.

51:22.958 --> 51:26.461
And the second ticket takes me back home
to Houston. Which is also the last stop.

51:26.545 --> 51:28.630
And you don't get off the bus before then.

51:28.714 --> 51:29.840
-I know.
-Okay.

51:31.675 --> 51:35.596
Aleida, I'm sorry
I didn't have enough for two tickets.

51:35.679 --> 51:37.890
I'll be okay, Papa. I promise.

51:37.973 --> 51:39.183
Okay.

51:42.102 --> 51:43.103
I love you.

51:45.147 --> 51:46.773
I'll be right here when you get back.

51:47.941 --> 51:49.109
Sorry.

52:16.178 --> 52:18.680
-Hello?
-Where the hell were you last night?

52:19.723 --> 52:22.476
I unplugged my phone
to get a good night's sleep. What's wrong?

52:22.893 --> 52:25.229
Nothing. I just... I don't know.

52:27.314 --> 52:29.942
What if there'd been an emergency
with one of the boys?

52:30.025 --> 52:31.527
Well, did something happen, babe?

52:31.610 --> 52:34.404
<i>No, but what if it did?</i>

52:34.488 --> 52:36.698
You know Baseops can get to me anytime.

52:37.157 --> 52:38.408
Yeah, I guess.

52:41.578 --> 52:42.788
So, when are you coming back?

52:44.540 --> 52:46.416
I don't know. A few days, maybe.

52:46.500 --> 52:48.877
You're going out tonight to celebrate?

52:49.461 --> 52:52.631
<i>Well, I don't know. Maybe.
You know what it's like here.</i>

52:53.048 --> 52:54.842
What's that supposed to mean?

52:54.925 --> 52:56.468
Well, I mean...

52:57.177 --> 52:59.930
-I don't know. It's launch day, you know?
-<i>Yep.</i>

53:01.223 --> 53:04.935
Yeah, okay. I just thought
you were worried about being a bad mother.

53:13.986 --> 53:14.987
What was that?

53:15.946 --> 53:16.947
What was what, hon?

53:18.615 --> 53:20.284
Hey, I gotta run.

53:20.367 --> 53:22.578
-I'll call you later. Love you.
-<i>Hey, wai--</i>

54:11.627 --> 54:14.630
I don't understand. I mean,
we were a few rows up for Apollo 10.

54:14.713 --> 54:16.757
It seems okay to me. We're closer, anyway.

54:18.091 --> 54:20.093
I just liked it better
where we sat before.

54:21.094 --> 54:22.262
Hi, ladies.

54:22.763 --> 54:24.056
Hello. Excuse me.

54:28.644 --> 54:29.645
Is that him?

54:30.145 --> 54:31.146
That's him.

54:36.652 --> 54:37.694
-Hello.
-Yeah.

54:37.778 --> 54:39.571
-Karen Baldwin.
-Wayne Cobb.

54:41.615 --> 54:42.824
That's a great dress.

54:43.992 --> 54:45.160
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

55:28.954 --> 55:29.872
Tighter.

55:31.456 --> 55:32.457
Tighter.

57:28.490 --> 57:30.909
That was quite a send-off.

57:33.704 --> 57:35.789
Buncha people cheering for shit.

57:36.373 --> 57:37.875
I haven't done anything yet.
