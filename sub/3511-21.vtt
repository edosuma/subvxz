00:03.555 --> 00:05.121
Let's keep this going, people!

00:05.122 --> 00:07.084
This is a big night for us.

00:08.128 --> 00:11.078
You! Get it together, man.
Focus!

00:11.079 --> 00:11.909
Yes, Chef.

00:12.364 --> 00:14.529
Table 21. Order in. Appetizer.

00:14.530 --> 00:16.466
One tuna crudo. One pork belly.

00:16.467 --> 00:19.115
Two salmons. One squab.
One quail.

00:21.163 --> 00:22.143
Lovely.

00:22.220 --> 00:23.269
Off it goes.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

00:39.527 --> 00:40.477
Here you are.

00:42.438 --> 00:43.928
Excuse me. There you go.

00:44.916 --> 00:45.934
Enjoy.

00:46.670 --> 00:49.050
Well, bon appetit, everyone.

00:50.488 --> 00:53.749
So, Eric, how would
another $20 million

00:53.750 --> 00:55.924
for Mexisolar sit with you?

00:55.925 --> 00:57.832
Once I've seen that factory.

00:57.919 --> 01:00.066
Enough business. Eat. Drink.

01:00.067 --> 01:01.940
Be merry for once in your life.

01:04.623 --> 01:06.958
My God, this food is sublime.

01:06.959 --> 01:08.232
I should hope so.

01:08.233 --> 01:10.482
This is the toughest
reservation in the city.

01:18.423 --> 01:19.408
Arthur?

01:21.637 --> 01:22.958
Someone call 9-1-1.

01:24.334 --> 01:26.323
Now you're dead so
you can suck it.

01:27.552 --> 01:28.479
Oh, you want more?

01:28.923 --> 01:30.194
Come get it, buddy.

01:30.451 --> 01:32.734
'Cause I got something
special for you.

01:34.705 --> 01:37.142
And I got something
special for you...

01:37.452 --> 01:38.610
too.

01:40.999 --> 01:42.590
Well, that's not
lookin' too good.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.466
What? Castle...

01:45.361 --> 01:46.755
Well, then stick your
head out, Patel,

01:46.756 --> 01:48.689
and get poned like a real man.

01:49.319 --> 01:50.472
Who is Patel?

01:50.510 --> 01:51.644
He's this kid from India.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.449
He's been thrashing me for
weeks, but not tonight.

01:53.450 --> 01:55.318
Tonight I am bringing it.

01:55.453 --> 01:56.905
It stings, doesn't it?

01:56.906 --> 01:57.916
Yeah, it kinda does.

01:57.917 --> 01:59.156
- Castle.
- What?

01:59.274 --> 02:02.100
Would you rather play with a
kid in an imaginary world

02:02.496 --> 02:03.595
or with...

02:04.784 --> 02:06.233
in the real world.

02:07.158 --> 02:08.982
I w--

02:09.996 --> 02:12.445
I, uh, uh...

02:12.765 --> 02:14.507
- Oh, my God.
- What?

02:14.508 --> 02:17.244
Oh, my God. You actually have
to think about this?

02:17.275 --> 02:18.056
No.

02:21.599 --> 02:23.384
No. I don't have
to think about it.

02:23.515 --> 02:24.533
Come on over here.

02:25.274 --> 02:26.641
- Are you kidding me?
- What?

02:26.642 --> 02:27.924
You know what? Forget it.

02:27.992 --> 02:29.842
- Seriously, I died on purpose for you.
- Whatever.

02:29.843 --> 02:31.134
Come on. What.

02:31.997 --> 02:34.399
No, I-- it's not my mom.

02:34.447 --> 02:35.378
It's worse.

02:35.379 --> 02:36.693
Yeah, see you Thursday.

02:37.579 --> 02:39.924
I'm sorry.
You know how I get when I'm gaming.

02:39.925 --> 02:41.870
I was--I was in the zone.
I was like Gretzky.

02:41.871 --> 02:43.833
Well, at least Gretzky
knew how to score.

02:43.834 --> 02:45.272
Ouch. Okay.

02:45.273 --> 02:47.669
Look, I'm--again, I'm
very, very sorry.

02:47.670 --> 02:48.680
Do you forgive me?

02:49.109 --> 02:50.743
You know, Castle, it
wasn't too long ago

02:50.744 --> 02:53.069
when me wearing a sexy
outfit would get...

02:53.382 --> 02:55.606
an immediate response from you.

02:56.615 --> 02:57.265
What are you saying,

02:57.266 --> 02:58.352
that I'm taking you for granted?

02:58.353 --> 02:59.906
I don't know, Castle. Are you?

03:00.115 --> 03:01.839
Hey, guys. Victim's over here.

03:03.149 --> 03:05.507
Name is Arthur Felder, 54.

03:05.508 --> 03:07.581
He's a wealthy
venture capitalist.

03:07.588 --> 03:10.504
Witness said that he took
one bite of his squab

03:10.505 --> 03:12.379
and did a nose dive
into his plate.

03:12.437 --> 03:14.621
Okay, so this was not
an allergic reaction?

03:14.622 --> 03:16.094
There's no sign of anaphylaxis,

03:16.095 --> 03:18.537
but his enlarged pupils
and excessive saliva

03:18.538 --> 03:20.327
suggest a foreign substance.

03:20.457 --> 03:21.891
- He was poisoned.
- It looks that way,

03:21.892 --> 03:24.029
but I won't know for sure
until I run a tox screen.

03:24.030 --> 03:25.573
So how many people had
access to the food

03:25.574 --> 03:26.518
before it was delivered?

03:26.519 --> 03:28.399
Esposito's checking on that right...
now.

03:28.400 --> 03:29.521
Is that Eric Vaughn?

03:29.522 --> 03:32.554
Uh, yeah. He was part of
the victim's dinner party.

03:32.555 --> 03:34.061
He's that billionaire
inventor, right?

03:34.077 --> 03:34.624
Yeah.

03:34.635 --> 03:37.356
Inventor, innovator,
and number eight on my LSL.

03:37.402 --> 03:39.146
- LSL?
- Last Supper List.

03:39.517 --> 03:41.898
You and a table of 12,
anyone from history.

03:41.899 --> 03:43.558
What is mine, you ask?
I'm glad you did.

03:43.559 --> 03:46.888
In order, it is Lincoln,
Einstein, Ian Fleming,

03:46.889 --> 03:48.174
John Lennon, Joan Of Arc,

03:48.175 --> 03:49.166
Sinatra...

03:50.746 --> 03:52.381
And you, of course.

03:52.382 --> 03:53.518
Too late, Castle.

03:56.827 --> 03:58.282
So who made the reservation?

03:58.283 --> 04:00.171
I did, about a week ago.

04:00.172 --> 04:00.976
Did anyone else know

04:00.977 --> 04:02.572
that Mr. Felder would be
here tonight?

04:02.573 --> 04:03.700
Uh, his office,

04:03.701 --> 04:05.916
but I have no idea who
they might have told.

04:06.546 --> 04:07.745
Uh, Mr. Vaughn?

04:09.327 --> 04:11.221
- Okay...
- Excuse me?

04:11.222 --> 04:12.355
- As you can.
- Hey.

04:12.356 --> 04:14.301
Fantastic. Thank you. All right.

04:14.604 --> 04:16.281
This is a murder investigation.

04:16.283 --> 04:18.076
I'm gonna need your
full attention.

04:18.077 --> 04:20.397
I'm so sorry. That was my pilot.

04:20.398 --> 04:21.970
Arthur's family's
in the Caribbean.

04:21.971 --> 04:24.198
I was arranging for my
plane to bring them home.

04:25.334 --> 04:26.373
Oh. Yeah.

04:26.754 --> 04:29.047
Well, that's very generous
of you, Mr. Vaughn.

04:29.048 --> 04:30.975
No, please, call me Eric.
And you are?

04:30.976 --> 04:32.521
Uh, I'm Detective Kate Beckett.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.311
And I am Richard Castle.

04:34.312 --> 04:35.897
- Oh, the writer?
- Yeah.

04:35.898 --> 04:37.191
My mother loves your novels.

04:37.192 --> 04:38.703
Oh, I'll get her an
autographed copy.

04:38.704 --> 04:40.646
So how well did you
know our victim?

04:40.948 --> 04:42.846
We'd been doing business
for many years.

04:42.847 --> 04:44.541
But, uh, we weren't
close, I'm afraid.

04:44.542 --> 04:45.957
Any idea who would
want him dead?

04:45.958 --> 04:49.207
None. Uh, this-- this
whole thing is terrible.

04:49.208 --> 04:50.447
Hey, Beckett.

04:50.572 --> 04:51.781
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

04:51.782 --> 04:53.411
So normally only a
handful of waitstaff

04:53.412 --> 04:55.267
handle each entree,
but in this case,

04:55.268 --> 04:56.917
it could've been somebody
from the outside.

04:56.918 --> 04:58.455
There was a kitchen
door propped open,

04:58.456 --> 05:00.328
and CSU found this waiter's vest

05:00.329 --> 05:01.566
stashed in a dumpster.

05:01.706 --> 05:03.434
Okay, have unis
canvass the area,

05:03.435 --> 05:04.503
and I'm gonna want to interview

05:04.504 --> 05:05.811
all of the kitchen
staff as well.

05:05.812 --> 05:06.715
Right.

05:11.630 --> 05:12.574
Yes.

05:19.718 --> 05:20.661
What?

05:21.108 --> 05:23.400
Looks as though Vaughn
is on your list as well.

05:23.422 --> 05:25.150
Oh. The things you notice

05:25.151 --> 05:27.030
when you're paying
attention, Castle.

05:29.560 --> 05:31.354
Yeah, I've been a busboy
there for two years.

05:31.355 --> 05:32.750
So where were you at 8:20?

05:32.751 --> 05:35.714
8:20? Um, I was at a back
sink scraping dishes.

05:36.574 --> 05:37.936
All right.
Um, did you happen to see

05:37.937 --> 05:39.662
anyone in the kitchen that
you didn't recognize?

05:39.663 --> 05:41.737
Yeah, you know, someone
brushed past me.

05:41.738 --> 05:42.801
Uh, I didn't get a good look,

05:42.802 --> 05:44.776
but I remember thinking
that he wasn't familiar.

05:44.777 --> 05:45.744
Can you describe him?

05:45.745 --> 05:49.302
Not really.
He was short, dark hair, maybe.

05:49.687 --> 05:51.507
Uh, things move fast
in the kitchen,

05:51.508 --> 05:53.851
so I only caught him out
of the corner of my eye.

05:53.895 --> 05:55.815
Tell me about that back door.
Is it always open?

05:55.816 --> 05:57.386
- I-it shouldn't be.
- Hey.

05:57.931 --> 05:59.510
So it looks like our
victim-- Arthur Felder--

05:59.511 --> 06:01.495
wasn't the most
fuzziest of guys.

06:01.506 --> 06:03.529
He made his fortune
in hostile takeovers.

06:03.530 --> 06:04.397
A couple of weeks ago,

06:04.398 --> 06:05.929
he shut down a chemical
plant in Newark

06:05.930 --> 06:07.160
and sold it off for parts.

06:07.161 --> 06:09.423
It says here that 200
people lost their jobs.

06:09.424 --> 06:11.057
Yeah, and according
to his assistant,

06:11.058 --> 06:12.612
they got quite a
few death threats

06:12.613 --> 06:13.876
after they announced
the closing.

06:14.056 --> 06:16.399
Corporate raider shutters
a chemical plant

06:16.400 --> 06:19.908
and ends up eating crow, or
in this case, poisoned squab.

06:20.272 --> 06:22.727
It's poetic,
diabolically speaking.

06:23.090 --> 06:24.694
Okay, Castle and I
will talk to Lanie

06:24.695 --> 06:25.715
to see if there's any connection

06:25.716 --> 06:27.378
between the poison
and the plant.

06:27.379 --> 06:28.356
In the meantime,
why don't you guys

06:28.357 --> 06:30.325
go through the list of
people that made threats

06:30.326 --> 06:32.103
and see if anyone
was in the vicinity

06:32.104 --> 06:33.076
of the restaurant?

06:33.077 --> 06:33.933
Right on.

06:35.158 --> 06:37.363
Sorry. It's not a match
for any of the chemicals

06:37.364 --> 06:38.967
manufactured by that plant.

06:38.968 --> 06:40.199
So what was he poisoned with?

06:40.200 --> 06:42.769
Something exotic enough
not to show up on a chem

06:42.770 --> 06:44.882
and unknown toxin evaluation.

06:44.883 --> 06:47.039
I'm running further tests,
but all I can say for sure

06:47.040 --> 06:49.454
is that it was some sort
of paralyzing agent.

06:49.698 --> 06:52.403
Speaking of paralyzing agent...

06:52.482 --> 06:55.324
Can I just say, Eric Vaughn?!

06:55.325 --> 06:56.261
See, Castle?

06:56.262 --> 06:57.879
Look, he's on everybody's list.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.780
Yes, yes, he's quite impressive.

06:59.781 --> 07:00.514
And handsome.

07:00.515 --> 07:02.666
And don't forget rich.
And that accent?

07:02.667 --> 07:04.452
- Ooh, honey.
- Oh, I know.

07:04.453 --> 07:05.604
All right! Okay.

07:05.865 --> 07:07.820
I admit, all right,

07:07.821 --> 07:10.097
just as lesser men
aspire to be me,

07:10.098 --> 07:12.409
he's who the mes of the
world aspire to be, okay?

07:12.410 --> 07:15.300
But that is not gonna help us
solve Arthur Felder's murder.

07:15.301 --> 07:17.065
Finding out what he was
poisoned with will.

07:17.066 --> 07:18.958
Well, I can tell you this,

07:18.959 --> 07:21.900
whatever the poison was,
was chemically synthesized

07:21.901 --> 07:23.627
and incredibly fast-acting.

07:23.628 --> 07:25.115
The mushrooms he was eating

07:25.116 --> 07:26.730
never even made it
to his stomach.

07:26.731 --> 07:28.961
Thank you. Wait. Mushrooms?

07:29.218 --> 07:30.124
I saw the menu.

07:30.125 --> 07:32.813
The mushrooms were served with
the quail, not the squab.

07:32.814 --> 07:33.854
You're right.

07:34.681 --> 07:36.886
But Ryan said that
Felder had the squab.

07:37.623 --> 07:38.589
Yeah, it's my handwriting.

07:38.590 --> 07:39.736
And it's right here
on the ticket.

07:39.737 --> 07:41.134
Mr. Felder ordered the squab.

07:41.135 --> 07:42.182
Well, we have reason to believe

07:42.183 --> 07:43.869
that he actually ate the quail.

07:43.870 --> 07:46.042
The poisoned quail, Lucas.

07:46.043 --> 07:47.462
How did he end up with it?

07:48.734 --> 07:51.362
Oh, no.
I-I must have made a mistake.

07:51.390 --> 07:52.746
I'm still learning
the spring menu,

07:52.747 --> 07:54.304
and the quail with the mushrooms

07:54.305 --> 07:56.489
looks a lot like the squab
with the artichoke hearts.

07:56.490 --> 07:57.776
And chef was screaming.

07:57.777 --> 07:59.292
So you mixed up the orders.

08:00.074 --> 08:01.017
Oh, God.

08:01.811 --> 08:03.512
Okay, if Felder
ordered the squab,

08:03.513 --> 08:04.924
then who ordered the quail?

08:06.322 --> 08:07.046
Yeah, here it is.

08:07.047 --> 08:09.561
The quail was supposed
to go to Eric Vaughn.

08:11.207 --> 08:13.012
Felder wasn't the
intended target.

08:14.420 --> 08:15.732
They were trying to kill Vaughn.

08:30.832 --> 08:32.889
You mean to say, that
poison was meant for me?

08:33.058 --> 08:34.282
It seems that way.

08:34.594 --> 08:35.760
Oh, good God.

08:36.259 --> 08:37.892
What am I gonna
tell Arthur's wife?

08:38.169 --> 08:38.929
Mr. Vaughn--

08:38.931 --> 08:40.509
Eric, please.

08:40.870 --> 08:44.207
Eric. Um, look, I
understand your concern,

08:44.207 --> 08:46.351
but right now, I think
we need to focus on you.

08:46.352 --> 08:48.403
Now do you know of anyone
that would want you dead?

08:48.493 --> 08:50.853
No, but you don't
get to where I am

08:50.854 --> 08:52.373
without making enemies,

08:52.410 --> 08:54.297
when one of my
innovations succeeds,

08:54.298 --> 08:56.089
it often means that
someone else's fails.

08:56.249 --> 08:57.414
And being high profile,

08:57.415 --> 08:58.990
people tend to want
things from me

08:58.991 --> 09:01.014
or get angry for things
that I can't control.

09:01.015 --> 09:03.040
Well, it sounds like
being Eric Vaughn

09:03.041 --> 09:04.244
has its price.

09:04.988 --> 09:06.969
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not complaining.

09:06.989 --> 09:09.643
I'm sure you face much tougher
situations every day.

09:11.072 --> 09:13.055
Well, you know, when someone
is trying to kill you,

09:13.056 --> 09:14.964
I think that you have
every right to complain.

09:17.840 --> 09:19.340
So what about recently?

09:19.933 --> 09:21.570
Have you received any threats?

09:21.721 --> 09:23.103
Not that I'm aware of.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.975
But if my people don't
think it's serious,

09:24.976 --> 09:26.830
they often don't
bother to tell me.

09:26.831 --> 09:28.857
My assistant Petra can
get you the file.

09:28.971 --> 09:30.794
We'll need as much background
as she can give us--

09:30.795 --> 09:33.051
disgruntled employees,
angry competitors,

09:33.052 --> 09:34.482
lawsuits, things like that.

09:34.483 --> 09:36.121
Uh, whatever you need.

09:37.099 --> 09:38.214
Detective,

09:39.075 --> 09:40.923
whoever did this is
still out there.

09:41.149 --> 09:43.976
It wouldn't be crazy to
assume they might try again.

09:44.862 --> 09:46.812
No. Uh, no, it wouldn't.

09:46.813 --> 09:50.430
Um, look, I can assign some
uniformed officers to you,

09:50.431 --> 09:52.862
but I think, until we figure
out who's behind this,

09:52.863 --> 09:55.230
you might consider
hiring private security.

09:58.481 --> 09:59.688
And there you go.

10:00.240 --> 10:01.157
What is this?

10:01.158 --> 10:03.301
It's just me not taking
you for granted.

10:03.302 --> 10:04.149
Oh.

10:04.231 --> 10:06.417
So what did you talk about
there, you and Vaughn?

10:06.418 --> 10:08.138
Oh, we were just going
over the investigation,

10:08.139 --> 10:10.359
talking out the next few s--

10:12.147 --> 10:13.148
Wait a minute. Is this--

10:13.149 --> 10:14.015
Are you...

10:14.850 --> 10:16.278
Is this you being jealous?

10:17.603 --> 10:18.633
Jealous?

10:20.292 --> 10:21.161
Yes.

10:21.162 --> 10:23.717
The guy won a Macarthur
Genius Award.

10:23.718 --> 10:25.280
Do you know who they
give those awards to?

10:25.296 --> 10:26.865
Geniuses. Okay?

10:26.866 --> 10:28.833
He's got one company bringing
clean water to Africa

10:28.834 --> 10:31.468
and another one that might
actually cure cancer.

10:31.469 --> 10:33.884
So, yes, when you're in
a room with him alone,

10:34.062 --> 10:35.352
I'm a little jealous.

10:35.353 --> 10:37.086
I saw--I saw how
you looked at him.

10:37.087 --> 10:39.557
Oh, my gosh. Castle.
It's Eric Vaughn.

10:39.558 --> 10:41.468
He was voted one of the hundred

10:41.469 --> 10:43.304
most interesting
people on the planet.

10:43.305 --> 10:45.228
Of course I'm gonna
swoon a little,

10:45.538 --> 10:46.202
just like you would

10:46.203 --> 10:47.737
if Bar Refaeli walked
through the door.

10:47.738 --> 10:49.016
But it's meaningless.

10:49.290 --> 10:51.059
Yeah, you're right. It's just...

10:51.724 --> 10:53.043
The guy's so impressive.

10:53.949 --> 10:55.175
But he's not you.

10:56.141 --> 10:58.066
Besides, the guy could
get any woman he wants.

10:58.067 --> 10:59.534
He's not interested in me.

11:00.690 --> 11:02.286
Right? I know.

11:03.678 --> 11:04.241
Okay.

11:04.242 --> 11:05.579
I spoke with the commissioner,

11:05.580 --> 11:08.379
and he's agreed to provide
Vaughn with a protective detail.

11:08.380 --> 11:10.918
Uh, great.
I actually have a few uniforms

11:10.919 --> 11:12.081
that I'd like to
recommend for duty.

11:12.082 --> 11:14.600
No. Mr. Vaughn has requested you.

11:15.264 --> 11:16.154
He what now?

11:16.155 --> 11:19.117
Sir, I'm a homicide detective,
not some bodyguard.

11:19.118 --> 11:20.475
Trust me, I know.

11:20.476 --> 11:22.930
But this comes directly
from the commissioner.

11:22.931 --> 11:25.406
Why doesn't Vaughn just
hire a private army?

11:25.407 --> 11:26.173
He can afford that.

11:26.174 --> 11:27.961
I don't know why, Mr. Castle.

11:27.962 --> 11:29.655
I just know what my orders are.

11:29.656 --> 11:33.319
He wants Detective Beckett
and only Beckett.

11:34.680 --> 11:35.996
Can he even do that?

11:36.358 --> 11:37.701
I think he just did.

11:40.990 --> 11:42.280
Beckett's hanging with Vaughn?

11:42.281 --> 11:44.445
Oh, hell, yeah, you
should be worried.

11:44.538 --> 11:47.031
His hit list includes half
of "Maxim's" hot 100.

11:47.032 --> 11:48.077
Oh, and unlike you,

11:48.078 --> 11:49.769
his helicopter doesn't
need a remote control.

11:49.770 --> 11:52.317
Don't listen to him, Castle.
Beckett's loyal to you.

11:52.318 --> 11:54.167
She's not gonna be
seduced by his charms.

11:54.168 --> 11:56.180
Really? So you'd let Jenny
hang with him then?

11:56.181 --> 11:58.135
Hell, no.
I wouldn't let Jenny near that guy.

11:58.136 --> 11:58.941
Thanks.

11:58.942 --> 12:01.304
Okay, but... I'm not worried.

12:01.874 --> 12:03.795
I'm not. Okay? I just--

12:03.796 --> 12:05.250
I can't believe
that the department

12:05.251 --> 12:07.424
is forcing her to hang out
with some womanizing rich guy

12:07.425 --> 12:08.559
against her will.

12:09.546 --> 12:10.669
Yeah. Unbelievable.

12:10.670 --> 12:11.894
Yeah, she's never done that.

12:11.895 --> 12:13.078
You know what we need to do?

12:13.329 --> 12:15.159
We need to solve
this case, and fast.

12:15.160 --> 12:16.860
Okay? The sooner we
catch this killer,

12:16.861 --> 12:18.484
the sooner we get her
away from Vaughn.

12:18.485 --> 12:20.398
Where are we on that waiter
vest we found in the alley?

12:20.399 --> 12:22.530
CSU was checking for trace evidence.
No fibers.

12:22.531 --> 12:24.059
And they couldn't pull any
prints off the buttons.

12:24.060 --> 12:25.588
No. Have 'em do it again.

12:25.589 --> 12:27.398
Whoever wore that
vest is our killer.

12:27.399 --> 12:28.902
- I know. We have done this before.
- Have you?

12:28.903 --> 12:30.395
Castle! Chill.

12:30.648 --> 12:31.933
We may have another lead.

12:31.934 --> 12:33.357
Uniforms picked
up a homeless guy

12:33.358 --> 12:35.376
in the same alley right
where that vest was found.

12:35.377 --> 12:36.255
He may have seen something.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.888
Well, then why aren't
we talking to him?

12:37.889 --> 12:40.548
Because at the moment, he is stupid drunk.
Seeing double.

12:40.549 --> 12:42.984
We'll have a better chance of a
description once he sobers up.

12:43.341 --> 12:45.272
- I'm on it.
- What do you mean, you're on it?

12:45.273 --> 12:45.953
- Where are you going?
- To make

12:45.954 --> 12:48.247
him the best damn cup of
coffee he's ever had.

12:50.219 --> 12:51.595
This is a big mistake.

12:51.596 --> 12:53.626
The best way for me
to keep you alive

12:53.627 --> 12:55.723
is to get out there
and catch the guy

12:55.724 --> 12:56.791
that's behind this.

12:56.792 --> 12:58.373
You underestimate
yourself, Detective.

12:58.374 --> 12:59.705
I'm quite sure you can do both.

12:59.706 --> 13:01.522
And are you willing to
bet your life on that?

13:01.858 --> 13:03.025
You don't even know me.

13:03.026 --> 13:04.107
I know enough.

13:04.418 --> 13:06.354
You graduated at the
top of your class.

13:06.537 --> 13:07.486
You're the youngest woman

13:07.487 --> 13:09.723
in the history of the
NYPD to make detective.

13:09.724 --> 13:11.002
You have the highest
closure rate

13:11.003 --> 13:12.218
of anyone in the department.

13:12.219 --> 13:13.049
And earlier this year,

13:13.050 --> 13:15.640
you bucked every protocol
to save a senator's life.

13:16.346 --> 13:18.304
Do you have any idea how
remarkable you are?

13:20.803 --> 13:22.077
You don't, do you?

13:23.271 --> 13:25.509
If anyone can keep
me safe, it's you.

13:26.768 --> 13:27.937
Good afternoon, Eric.

13:28.273 --> 13:29.794
We've put extra
security in place,

13:29.795 --> 13:31.656
but we have to talk
about Mexisolar.

13:31.805 --> 13:32.817
Detective Beckett,

13:32.818 --> 13:34.372
David Anderson, my attorney.

13:34.389 --> 13:35.781
The detective is
looking after me,

13:35.782 --> 13:37.248
so make sure she has
everything she needs.

13:37.249 --> 13:38.223
If he gives you any trouble,

13:38.224 --> 13:40.431
we can put him on investor
conference calls all day.

13:40.432 --> 13:41.716
I might take you up on that.

13:43.065 --> 13:46.680
Eric, it's important to
keep Mexisolar R&D moving

13:46.681 --> 13:48.001
- if we want to launch Q-3.
- Detective.

13:48.002 --> 13:50.635
I put together summaries of our
entire portfolio of companies...

13:50.636 --> 13:51.602
per your request,

13:51.603 --> 13:54.333
along with any complaints
against them or Mr. Vaughn.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.292
Briefing in an hour?

13:55.293 --> 13:56.653
Yeah, that would be great.
Thanks.

13:58.794 --> 13:59.886
Hey, Lanie. What's up?

13:59.903 --> 14:01.176
Your cause of death.

14:01.177 --> 14:03.941
The poison was a
chemically synthesized,

14:03.942 --> 14:05.228
weaponized agent,

14:05.229 --> 14:08.228
similar to the organic
compound saxitoxin.

14:08.440 --> 14:09.816
Saxitoxin?

14:10.508 --> 14:11.373
It usually occurs

14:11.374 --> 14:13.330
in shellfish, but
not this version.

14:13.331 --> 14:17.715
Whoever created this had access
to a pretty sophisticated lab,

14:17.716 --> 14:19.588
and this one's
been supercharged.

14:19.817 --> 14:21.950
- Thanks.
- Speaking of supercharged,

14:21.951 --> 14:24.575
is it true that you're
with Eric Vaughn?

14:24.576 --> 14:25.663
I mean, Kate I know

14:25.664 --> 14:28.338
you love Castle and all,
but, girlfriend--

14:28.339 --> 14:29.430
Bye, Lanie.

14:30.317 --> 14:31.376
Bye.

14:31.422 --> 14:32.898
Hello there, Lanie.

14:32.899 --> 14:34.451
I'm Eric Vaughn.

14:34.452 --> 14:37.724
Ah, and I think you're
absolutely ravishing.

14:37.927 --> 14:39.033
Saxitoxin?

14:39.034 --> 14:40.279
Yeah, are you familiar with it?

14:40.280 --> 14:42.696
The Vaughn alliance partnered
with a university lab

14:42.697 --> 14:45.289
to develop a
next-generation antidote

14:45.290 --> 14:47.834
to that entire class
of neurotoxins.

14:48.046 --> 14:48.903
And have you had troubles

14:48.904 --> 14:50.790
with anyone associated
with the lab?

14:52.414 --> 14:53.464
Cindy.

14:54.627 --> 14:55.740
Who's Cindy?

14:56.447 --> 14:59.018
Cindy Paralti.
She's our lead researcher.

15:01.007 --> 15:01.990
A few months ago,

15:01.991 --> 15:03.975
we were presenting at a
conference in Singapore.

15:04.010 --> 15:05.176
We had a few drinks, and--

15:05.211 --> 15:07.407
And it ended badly. I get it.

15:07.408 --> 15:09.294
Actually, it started badly.

15:09.295 --> 15:11.268
She expressed some
deep-seated feelings for me,

15:11.269 --> 15:12.807
ones that I didn't share,

15:12.985 --> 15:15.697
so when I declined,
she took it hard.

15:15.698 --> 15:16.834
He is being polite.

15:16.835 --> 15:19.031
She went "Fatal Attraction"
for a couple of weeks.

15:19.032 --> 15:20.458
And you still work with her?

15:21.399 --> 15:23.260
She's a very
talented researcher.

15:23.544 --> 15:28.135
Detective, we're all misled
by our hearts sometimes.

15:28.910 --> 15:30.268
It shouldn't end a career.

15:31.376 --> 15:33.114
It shouldn't end a life, either.

15:33.923 --> 15:35.118
So where does Cindy live?

15:35.119 --> 15:37.440
By the university labs
in Lower Manhattan.

15:38.221 --> 15:40.872
So in the city...
near the restaurant.

15:40.873 --> 15:42.944
And with access to saxitoxin.

15:44.123 --> 15:46.724
I have a PhD in chemistry
from MIT.

15:46.759 --> 15:48.763
Of course I've heard
of saxitoxin.

15:48.764 --> 15:49.794
Pretty dangerous stuff, Cindy.

15:49.829 --> 15:51.162
You ever work with any of it?

15:51.197 --> 15:53.131
We do, as do a lot
of other labs.

15:53.165 --> 15:55.105
Ms. Paralti, we understand
that you and Eric Vaughn

15:55.106 --> 15:57.257
had a personal falling out.

15:57.710 --> 15:59.190
Yeah. So?

15:59.191 --> 16:00.718
So any hard feelings?

16:01.550 --> 16:04.278
It was painful, but
I got over it.

16:04.279 --> 16:06.828
Did you? Because that
hasn't been your pattern.

16:06.829 --> 16:08.646
You've had restraining
orders filed against you

16:08.681 --> 16:10.843
by three ex-boyfriends.

16:10.844 --> 16:13.036
You've keyed cars,
slashed tires.

16:13.037 --> 16:14.881
Straight out of a
Carrie Underwood song.

16:14.882 --> 16:15.957
Yeah, but you know what

16:15.958 --> 16:17.690
- Carrie Underwood never sang about?
- What's that?

16:17.691 --> 16:18.890
Using a chemically
enhanced neurotoxin

16:18.924 --> 16:21.379
to poison a guy in a restaurant.

16:21.659 --> 16:23.125
See, Eric Vaughn, he survived.

16:23.126 --> 16:25.366
But one of the other people
he was with wasn't so lucky.

16:25.866 --> 16:27.701
Someone tried to kill Eric?

16:29.976 --> 16:31.499
No. I would never.

16:31.500 --> 16:32.449
Ms. Paralti,

16:32.450 --> 16:34.140
you had access to the toxin.

16:34.141 --> 16:35.589
Where were you
last night, Cindy?

16:35.590 --> 16:37.982
At the opera.
"Madame Butterfly."

16:38.390 --> 16:39.570
You can check.

16:43.870 --> 16:44.570
I got something.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.375
Okay, so after two cups
of coffee, a latte,

16:50.410 --> 16:51.648
and three espressos,
our homeless friend--

16:51.649 --> 16:53.545
Mr. Hazelton over there--
finally sobered up.

16:53.579 --> 16:55.747
He said he saw who stashed
the vest in the dumpster.

16:55.782 --> 16:57.582
He said the fellow was
dressed in a busboy uniform.

16:57.651 --> 16:58.535
Wait a minute.

16:58.536 --> 17:00.007
Are you saying it wasn't
someone from the outside?

17:00.008 --> 17:01.400
It was someone who
worked at Iago?

17:01.401 --> 17:03.797
Right. So I showed him photos
of all the Iago employees,

17:03.798 --> 17:05.046
and he fingered this guy.

17:06.161 --> 17:07.159
Cory Harrison.

17:07.352 --> 17:09.616
Wait a second.
I spoke with this guy.

17:09.617 --> 17:10.851
He tried to pin it
on somebody else.

17:10.852 --> 17:12.290
Well, then he's lying,
trying to make it look like

17:12.290 --> 17:13.763
it was someone from the outside
when it was him all along.

17:13.865 --> 17:16.063
- Why would he want to poison Vaughn?
- Let's ask him.

17:16.064 --> 17:17.329
- Coffee?
- No.

17:17.330 --> 17:18.877
I should probably stop, too.

17:19.271 --> 17:19.957
One more.

17:39.393 --> 17:40.461
NYPD!

17:41.141 --> 17:41.895
Police!

17:48.547 --> 17:49.344
Over here.

17:54.154 --> 17:55.574
Looks like someone
got here first.

18:08.713 --> 18:10.676
Ooh. Goose down allergy?

18:10.677 --> 18:13.056
I'll live, unlike Cory Harrison.

18:13.350 --> 18:16.358
Killer clearly used a pillow
as a poor-man's silencer.

18:16.490 --> 18:18.232
No sign of forced entry, either.

18:18.543 --> 18:19.804
Maybe he knew his killer.

18:19.904 --> 18:21.631
He also knew what was coming.

18:21.838 --> 18:24.864
I found defensive wounds
on Mr. Harrison's wrists.

18:24.865 --> 18:26.511
But that's all I'm gonna find.

18:26.512 --> 18:28.730
Someone washed his
hands with bleach.

18:28.832 --> 18:30.850
Disposing of DNA
and trace evidence?

18:31.081 --> 18:32.419
Shooter sounds like a pro.

18:32.420 --> 18:34.727
Yep, and I think I
know why he was here.

18:36.201 --> 18:37.325
The lab confirms it.

18:37.326 --> 18:39.448
The bottle in Cory
Harrison's apartment

18:39.449 --> 18:41.536
contains the toxin
that killed Felder.

18:41.585 --> 18:44.025
So someone was using him
to spike Vaughn's food,

18:44.026 --> 18:44.761
and then got rid of him.

18:44.762 --> 18:46.211
Which means somewhere
in Harrison's life--

18:46.212 --> 18:47.784
his family,
financials, or work--

18:47.785 --> 18:49.557
there's the key to whoever's
behind all of this.

18:49.558 --> 18:51.635
Maybe someone at the restaurant
knew what he was up to.

18:51.636 --> 18:52.544
- We should go back there.
- Mm-hmm.

18:52.545 --> 18:55.011
No, you and the boys can
go back there, Mr. Castle.

18:55.012 --> 18:56.820
Beckett's going to
the Fairwyck Hotel.

18:56.821 --> 18:57.822
What's at the Fairwyck?

18:58.003 --> 18:59.230
Eric Vaughn.

18:59.315 --> 19:01.336
As long as we have a
killer running around,

19:01.337 --> 19:02.614
I need him somewhere safe.

19:02.615 --> 19:04.642
He booked the
presidential suite,

19:04.643 --> 19:06.915
and from now until
the time we catch

19:06.916 --> 19:07.961
whoever's behind all this,

19:07.962 --> 19:09.131
you're staying there with him.

19:09.132 --> 19:10.534
In the presidential suite?

19:10.639 --> 19:13.344
Uh, Sir, are you s-serious?

19:13.345 --> 19:14.817
You want me to babysit this guy?

19:14.818 --> 19:15.852
He's insisting.

19:15.853 --> 19:18.182
Apparently, you made
quite an impression.

19:18.183 --> 19:19.795
Uh, Sir, I--

19:19.796 --> 19:21.809
Detective, I know how you feel,

19:22.009 --> 19:24.770
but whoever killed
that busboy was a pro,

19:24.771 --> 19:26.316
which means he may strike again,

19:26.317 --> 19:27.878
and I am not going to lose

19:27.879 --> 19:30.898
one of the world's most
influential men on my watch.

19:42.669 --> 19:44.470
You know, it's one thing
to follow him around,

19:44.504 --> 19:46.510
but quite another to be
shacking up with him.

19:46.511 --> 19:48.899
Castle, I am not
shacking up with him.

19:48.900 --> 19:50.603
I'm just doing my job.

19:51.160 --> 19:51.947
Right.

19:54.287 --> 19:55.737
You don't trust me.

19:55.956 --> 19:57.902
Oh, no. Of course I trust you.

19:58.024 --> 19:59.558
No, you don't.
That's what this is all about.

19:59.593 --> 20:00.993
Otherwise, this
wouldn't be an issue.

20:01.027 --> 20:01.897
Shall we?

20:06.543 --> 20:07.535
Yes.

20:16.009 --> 20:17.942
A coffee break at
a time like this?

20:17.943 --> 20:18.753
Really, guys?

20:19.258 --> 20:20.087
What's your problem, bro?

20:20.088 --> 20:21.133
Look, you need to call Jenny,

20:21.134 --> 20:22.514
and you need to call
whoever it is you call,

20:22.549 --> 20:24.820
because we are not going home
until we solve this murder.

20:24.973 --> 20:25.555
All right?

20:25.834 --> 20:27.661
Let's get to that restaurant
and get some answers.

20:31.421 --> 20:32.740
Seriously, guys. I mean it.

20:42.254 --> 20:44.905
This is the nicest safe
house I've ever seen.

20:45.458 --> 20:46.591
Well, if someone's
trying to kill you,

20:46.592 --> 20:48.128
you might as well make
the most of it, eh?

20:55.619 --> 20:56.654
I should get to work.

21:05.858 --> 21:08.125
Apologies to Novatech,

21:08.126 --> 21:10.897
and let's cancel the
Mexisolar trip until summer.

21:10.988 --> 21:11.925
Thanks, Petra.

21:11.968 --> 21:15.030
When were you last in
contact with Jeff Sussman?

21:15.250 --> 21:16.322
It's not Sussman.

21:16.838 --> 21:18.161
But you fired him,

21:18.162 --> 21:20.068
and he was convicted
of embezzling.

21:20.069 --> 21:21.746
That sounds like
a suspect to me.

21:21.747 --> 21:24.806
Look, the guy screwed
up and paid for it.

21:24.809 --> 21:27.605
But I set his mother up in
an assisted-living facility.

21:28.160 --> 21:29.518
Jeff was very grateful.

21:29.519 --> 21:30.549
It's not him.

21:33.779 --> 21:34.755
Are you expecting anyone?

21:34.756 --> 21:36.826
I took the liberty of
ordering some room service.

21:44.656 --> 21:46.544
Good evening, ma'am.
May I come in?

21:46.545 --> 21:48.401
Uh, actually, no. Sorry.

21:48.995 --> 21:49.604
Hey.

21:50.343 --> 21:52.346
Listen, given the way
that Felder was killed,

21:52.347 --> 21:55.784
I would prefer if my people
oversaw the food preparation.

21:55.785 --> 21:57.608
May I at least grab
the champagne?

21:57.825 --> 21:58.965
It is sealed.

21:59.856 --> 22:01.838
Yeah. Okay, fine.

22:03.586 --> 22:04.264
Excuse me.

22:04.347 --> 22:05.022
Here.

22:07.431 --> 22:08.532
Thank you, sir.

22:12.365 --> 22:14.266
I'll make sure that we get
you some food up here.

22:14.300 --> 22:16.524
That's okay.
We have the essentials.

22:17.603 --> 22:18.620
Pour you a glass?

22:18.779 --> 22:20.649
Oh, no, thank you. I'm on duty.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.911
You take your work seriously.

22:24.572 --> 22:25.826
I like that about you.

22:26.569 --> 22:28.155
It makes me feel safe.

22:29.605 --> 22:31.048
Oh, my God!

22:32.568 --> 22:33.170
No.

22:33.747 --> 22:34.572
Are you okay?

22:34.573 --> 22:37.015
Yes. I think you're gonna have
to protect me from myself.

22:38.337 --> 22:41.312
Okay. Um, I'm gonna go and
get you some ice, okay?

22:44.128 --> 22:45.528
You know what?
I'm glad Cory's dead.

22:45.529 --> 22:48.029
After what happened, the bloody
health department shut me down.

22:48.209 --> 22:50.259
I mean, if I'd known what he did,
I'd have killed him myself.

22:50.294 --> 22:52.162
Yeah, except we think

22:52.163 --> 22:53.926
whoever put him up to
poisoning your food

22:53.927 --> 22:55.090
was the one who killed him.

22:55.091 --> 22:58.190
You want revenge?
Help us find his killer.

22:58.757 --> 22:59.703
What do you want to know?

22:59.704 --> 23:01.506
Did you notice anything
unusual about Cory

23:01.507 --> 23:02.389
the day of the poisoning?

23:02.390 --> 23:04.249
Yeah.
The son of a bitch was late.

23:04.297 --> 23:05.304
I'm sorry. That's it?

23:05.305 --> 23:07.767
You don't understand.
No one's late, ever.

23:08.358 --> 23:09.299
It's one of my rules.

23:09.479 --> 23:10.885
I mean, I should've
fired him on the spot.

23:11.005 --> 23:11.893
Why didn't you?

23:12.585 --> 23:13.851
The look in his eyes.

23:14.738 --> 23:16.126
It was like he'd seen a ghost.

23:16.875 --> 23:18.454
Something happened
to him that day.

23:19.069 --> 23:20.149
Something bad.

23:24.048 --> 23:24.722
Here.

23:25.316 --> 23:26.232
That should help
with the swelling.

23:26.233 --> 23:29.163
Yes, but, uh, not my pride.

23:30.415 --> 23:31.710
You know, with your
bedside manner,

23:31.711 --> 23:32.914
you could've been a doctor.

23:32.915 --> 23:34.378
Me? No, no.

23:34.733 --> 23:37.226
A lawyer, maybe.
I was, uh, in pre-law.

23:38.541 --> 23:39.540
I could've represented you

23:39.541 --> 23:40.929
in your case against the cork.

23:43.899 --> 23:45.483
But instead, you became a cop.

23:46.299 --> 23:46.988
Why?

23:48.932 --> 23:51.045
Uh, someone close
to me was killed,

23:51.046 --> 23:52.389
and that just...

23:53.213 --> 23:54.987
changed things and changed me.

23:57.932 --> 23:59.645
You know, I was supposed
to be an architect.

24:00.347 --> 24:01.311
No, seriously.

24:01.504 --> 24:03.473
But my sister died when
I was in college--

24:03.706 --> 24:05.062
heart defect.

24:05.063 --> 24:05.996
So I dropped out

24:05.997 --> 24:08.372
and invented a new heart valve.

24:09.110 --> 24:10.619
That was my first patent.

24:11.911 --> 24:15.227
It's amazing how fate
changes lives, isn't it?

24:19.919 --> 24:21.040
I should get back to work.

24:21.539 --> 24:23.200
At least have a
glass of champagne.

24:23.607 --> 24:25.595
I mean, I have suffered
for it, after all.

24:26.777 --> 24:28.610
Okay, fine.

24:28.611 --> 24:30.399
You know what?
You put it that way...

24:30.614 --> 24:31.882
But just half a glass, okay?

24:32.037 --> 24:33.677
Go on. Three-quarters.

24:34.313 --> 24:35.259
Yeah.

24:39.437 --> 24:40.874
We talked to Cory
Harrison's girlfriend.

24:40.875 --> 24:42.306
According to her, he
was in a good mood

24:42.340 --> 24:43.903
when he left her apartment
yesterday morning.

24:43.904 --> 24:45.113
Then something
must have happened

24:45.114 --> 24:46.725
between home and the restaurant.

24:46.767 --> 24:48.137
In fact, something did.

24:48.665 --> 24:50.457
We took a look at
Cory's routine.

24:50.458 --> 24:52.156
Pretty much every morning,
he left his apartment,

24:52.157 --> 24:53.751
picked up his daughter,
took her to preschool.

24:53.785 --> 24:55.753
Then he'd walk to the bus stop,
where he'd catch the 10-X

24:55.787 --> 24:57.621
from Staten Island
into the city.

24:57.655 --> 24:59.089
Ah. Great, Captain, you're here.
Did you tell her?

24:59.124 --> 24:59.952
I did tell her.

25:00.258 --> 25:02.159
Okay, this is the
security video footage

25:02.193 --> 25:03.894
from the bus shelter yesterday.

25:03.928 --> 25:05.028
- Show her the... 
- Yeah.

25:05.063 --> 25:06.230
Show her the...

25:06.264 --> 25:07.431
Thank you.

25:07.465 --> 25:09.809
There's our busboy Cory
talking to some guy.

25:09.868 --> 25:11.861
And that is the 10-X bus,

25:11.862 --> 25:14.160
but Cory does not get on.

25:14.161 --> 25:14.872
He is late for work.

25:14.906 --> 25:17.953
He risks getting fired
just to talk to this guy.

25:17.954 --> 25:19.123
Well, what do we know about him?

25:19.124 --> 25:20.874
Nothing.
We can't get a good look at him.

25:20.875 --> 25:22.205
It's like he knows
where the camera is.

25:22.206 --> 25:24.072
Right, but this is where
it gets interesting.

25:24.073 --> 25:25.453
- How do I... 
- That one.

25:25.454 --> 25:26.123
That one?

25:30.083 --> 25:31.984
Wait.
That's the bottle of poison.

25:31.985 --> 25:34.565
Right, and after he used
it to poison the food,

25:34.566 --> 25:36.700
I'm betting this guy
came back and shot him

25:36.701 --> 25:37.951
to tie up loose ends.

25:41.412 --> 25:42.503
He's your killer.

25:51.887 --> 25:52.838
Look, I wish I could help you,

25:52.839 --> 25:55.604
but, uh, I simply
just don't know him.

25:55.821 --> 25:57.430
Ryan, we gotta go over
that video again.

25:57.431 --> 25:59.438
There's gotta be something in
it that'll help us figure out

25:59.439 --> 26:00.336
who he is.

26:05.061 --> 26:06.298
Uh, excuse me.

26:15.221 --> 26:17.486
Looks as though you two
were enjoying yourselves.

26:18.517 --> 26:19.148
Castle--

26:19.149 --> 26:20.917
What about pajamas--

26:21.108 --> 26:23.033
homely flannel or
skimpy sleep shorts?

26:23.034 --> 26:24.435
Oh, my gosh.
You're sounding like my dad

26:24.469 --> 26:26.271
dropping me off at summer camp.

26:26.608 --> 26:29.153
Did they serve champagne
at your summer camp?

26:29.154 --> 26:30.762
I was being polite.

26:30.763 --> 26:32.201
Castle, do you
think I want this?

26:32.240 --> 26:33.914
Do you think I asked to be here?

26:33.915 --> 26:35.139
I think you're making
the best of it.

26:35.140 --> 26:36.870
You know I would
rather be with you.

26:36.871 --> 26:38.710
Well, then maybe I should stay

26:38.711 --> 26:39.679
and we can protect him together.

26:39.680 --> 26:41.050
No, I am not letting
you do this.

26:41.051 --> 26:42.647
I'm not letting you
turn this investigation

26:42.648 --> 26:45.465
into some kind of a
twisted competition.

26:46.001 --> 26:46.714
Look...

26:46.718 --> 26:48.301
Don't make this harder
than it needs to be.

26:48.302 --> 26:50.777
- Please.
- Okay.

26:50.778 --> 26:52.454
But only because
you said please.

26:57.870 --> 26:59.798
Since we can't get a clean
look at this guy's face,

26:59.799 --> 27:00.721
I'm hoping there's
some other way

27:00.722 --> 27:01.829
we might be able to ID him.

27:02.042 --> 27:03.300
Fortunately, we're all much more

27:03.301 --> 27:05.043
than our faces, Detective.

27:05.936 --> 27:08.735
Harrison's driver's license
lists him at 5'10".

27:08.780 --> 27:11.171
That other guy looks
like he's 6'2".

27:11.172 --> 27:13.337
Posture is an indication
of spine curvature.

27:13.338 --> 27:15.546
I'd say it puts him
in his early 40s.

27:16.208 --> 27:17.413
Watch his hand.

27:17.422 --> 27:19.093
He makes two distinct movements.

27:19.094 --> 27:20.983
First he grabs
Mr. Harrison's arm,

27:20.984 --> 27:23.183
then he passes him
the poison spray.

27:23.732 --> 27:24.742
He's left-handed.

27:26.201 --> 27:27.620
And look at his neck.

27:28.843 --> 27:29.696
That's a bandage.

27:29.697 --> 27:31.362
Maybe covering up
a recent injury

27:31.363 --> 27:32.544
or a tattoo.

27:32.790 --> 27:33.525
- Yeah.
- Hey.

27:33.526 --> 27:35.596
So I think I know how this guy

27:35.597 --> 27:36.910
got Cory to poison the food.

27:36.911 --> 27:38.511
Don't say money.
I've been through his financials.

27:38.512 --> 27:39.442
There's nothing there.

27:39.476 --> 27:41.184
Might be something a
lot more personal.

27:41.186 --> 27:43.641
I canvassed the preschool
that Cory's daughter attends.

27:43.642 --> 27:45.168
A teacher recognized him

27:45.169 --> 27:46.696
when I showed her
the screengrab.

27:46.697 --> 27:47.568
Remembers seeing him

27:47.569 --> 27:48.824
hanging around the
school the day before.

27:48.825 --> 27:50.529
So you think he threatened
to hurt the daughter

27:50.530 --> 27:51.902
if Cory didn't poison the food?

27:51.903 --> 27:53.483
It might explain why
he was so upset

27:53.517 --> 27:54.756
when he got to the restaurant.

27:54.757 --> 27:55.918
Where are we on ballistics?

27:55.953 --> 27:57.520
Slug from the crime scene
is pretty mangled,

27:57.554 --> 27:59.489
but it's a possible match to
another one in the system.

27:59.523 --> 28:00.990
We should know more
in a few hours.

28:03.624 --> 28:04.487
Okay, dad.

28:04.632 --> 28:05.728
The box said something about

28:05.763 --> 28:08.615
a soothing infusion
of calming herbs.

28:10.067 --> 28:12.369
Anyway, it's a calm tea,
and you need to calm down.

28:12.370 --> 28:14.098
How am I supposed to calm down?

28:14.099 --> 28:15.717
It's Eric Vaughn.

28:15.718 --> 28:17.579
Dad, Beckett is over
the moon for you.

28:18.019 --> 28:19.498
So give her a
little credit, huh?

28:19.915 --> 28:22.393
It's no different than when she
was protecting Senator Bracken.

28:22.394 --> 28:23.641
Yeah, you're right.

28:23.696 --> 28:26.154
Oh! Except for the fact
that when it was Bracken,

28:26.155 --> 28:27.910
they weren't having
a slumber party

28:27.911 --> 28:28.732
at a fancy hotel.

28:28.733 --> 28:29.817
And let's face it.

28:29.851 --> 28:32.832
Compared to Bracken, Eric
Vaughn is like George Clooney.

28:32.833 --> 28:33.728
Oh, no.

28:33.729 --> 28:35.801
Eric Vaughn's way
sexier than Clooney.

28:37.850 --> 28:39.383
What? He is.

28:39.418 --> 28:41.651
Yes, and Beckett
is protecting him

28:41.652 --> 28:42.880
at the Fairwyck as we speak.

28:42.881 --> 28:43.680
Oops.

28:43.886 --> 28:46.632
I was just reminding dad that
Beckett is a professional

28:46.633 --> 28:48.192
and totally committed
to their relationship.

28:48.227 --> 28:50.131
Eh, well...

28:50.696 --> 28:52.217
Not totally committed.

28:52.218 --> 28:53.252
What do you mean?

28:53.804 --> 28:56.790
Well, there isn't a ring
on her finger, is there?

28:57.043 --> 28:58.168
- I...
- Technically,

28:58.207 --> 29:00.619
she's not really
committed at all.

29:01.129 --> 29:01.951
Ta.

29:07.004 --> 29:08.391
I'm gonna need more of that tea.

29:09.030 --> 29:11.317
Hey, Beckett, ballistics
got multiple matches

29:11.318 --> 29:13.540
on the gun used in Cory
Harrison's murder,

29:13.541 --> 29:14.428
connecting the weapon

29:14.429 --> 29:16.345
to four killings
outside the state.

29:16.346 --> 29:18.211
Okay, so where were
those other murders?

29:18.212 --> 29:20.787
Detroit, Chicago, Las
Vegas, and Memphis.

29:20.788 --> 29:22.950
There was never enough evidence,
but a name did come up.

29:22.951 --> 29:24.545
- Who?
- Thomas Barber.

29:24.546 --> 29:27.041
42. Used to be a
button man with links

29:27.042 --> 29:28.426
to organized crime in Chicago.

29:28.427 --> 29:30.771
According to his file,
he's a freelancer now.

29:30.772 --> 29:32.072
I'll text you his photo.

29:32.073 --> 29:34.593
So is this the same guy that
we saw on the bus stop video?

29:34.594 --> 29:36.783
Yep.
He's a match for height, age,

29:36.784 --> 29:39.303
- and placement of a creepy neck tattoo.
- All right.

29:39.304 --> 29:40.647
Put an APB out for him

29:40.648 --> 29:42.731
and start checking plane
and train manifests,

29:42.732 --> 29:44.960
along with any other
transportation systems

29:44.961 --> 29:46.149
into the city, and keep in mind,

29:46.150 --> 29:49.308
this guy is a gun for
hire, so we find him,

29:49.309 --> 29:51.164
we're gonna find whoever
put him up to this.

29:51.165 --> 29:53.113
- On it. Keep you posted.
- Okay.

29:55.246 --> 29:56.284
It's gonna be fine.

29:56.538 --> 29:57.414
I know it is.

29:57.864 --> 29:59.042
I've worked with the best,

29:59.043 --> 30:00.976
and you'd run circles
around any of them

30:00.977 --> 30:02.648
before your first cup of coffee.

30:02.980 --> 30:04.505
I feel completely
safe in your care.

30:04.506 --> 30:06.630
After knowing me
for just two days?

30:07.063 --> 30:09.459
No, after knowing you
for two minutes.

30:13.746 --> 30:16.404
So you think you got
me figured out, huh?

30:17.265 --> 30:19.208
Except for one thing.

30:19.490 --> 30:21.460
Are you and Castle...

30:28.048 --> 30:29.203
Yes.

30:30.402 --> 30:31.934
Is it serious?

30:34.130 --> 30:36.966
Yes. Yeah, you could
say it's serious.

30:36.967 --> 30:39.340
But the truth is, you
don't really know.

30:39.825 --> 30:41.570
Otherwise, you wouldn't
have hesitated.

30:41.571 --> 30:42.975
No, it's just, uh...

30:42.976 --> 30:46.182
We've never really talked about it.
That's all.

30:46.259 --> 30:47.672
Why not?

30:48.967 --> 30:50.462
We just haven't.

30:50.463 --> 30:51.843
Then he's a fool.

30:51.844 --> 30:53.681
No, it's, uh...

30:55.984 --> 30:58.153
It's just, it's--it's
complicated.

30:58.154 --> 30:59.555
Kate,

30:59.566 --> 31:01.911
there's nothing complicated
about meeting a woman like you

31:01.912 --> 31:03.825
and knowing what to do.

31:11.794 --> 31:12.721
No.

31:13.997 --> 31:15.551
Aah! Get down!

31:29.509 --> 31:30.126
Okay why?

31:30.127 --> 31:31.504
Hey, Beckett.

31:31.505 --> 31:33.291
Hey, Castle. I'm fine.

31:33.515 --> 31:34.622
Okay.

31:34.648 --> 31:36.220
All right. Thanks, Captain.

31:36.748 --> 31:38.283
Vaughn's already back
at the precinct.

31:38.284 --> 31:40.906
Gates wants to keep him there
until we find a new safe house.

31:40.907 --> 31:42.297
Yeah, preferably one
without windows

31:42.298 --> 31:44.003
that snipers can shoot through.

31:44.004 --> 31:46.736
It looks like the shot came from
the hotel across the street.

31:46.737 --> 31:49.470
Uniforms are canvassing for
Barber, but so far, nothing.

31:49.471 --> 31:50.064
I don't understand.

31:50.065 --> 31:51.753
How did he even know you
and Vaughn were here?

31:51.754 --> 31:52.961
Well, maybe he's
been watching us

31:52.962 --> 31:54.875
since Vaughn survived the
attempt at the restaurant.

31:54.876 --> 31:56.709
Hey, Beckett, I hate
to do this to you,

31:56.741 --> 31:58.218
but I need to take
your statement.

31:58.219 --> 31:59.143
No, that's fine.

31:59.144 --> 32:02.263
All right, uh, where were you
standing when the first shot came?

32:03.873 --> 32:04.601
Uh...

32:04.602 --> 32:06.017
I was...

32:07.095 --> 32:08.622
right over here.

32:10.393 --> 32:12.164
Okay, and, um,

32:12.165 --> 32:13.454
where was Vaughn?

32:14.797 --> 32:16.077
Right there.

32:16.136 --> 32:18.753
Right, uh... here?

32:19.023 --> 32:20.517
Yeah.

32:20.907 --> 32:23.076
Why was he standing so close?

32:23.865 --> 32:25.820
I don't understand.
That would...

32:26.067 --> 32:28.789
Wait a minute.
If he was standing there...

32:29.712 --> 32:31.845
then the bullet would've gone

32:31.846 --> 32:33.845
right through his head.

32:34.834 --> 32:36.445
How did Barber miss?

32:36.446 --> 32:39.495
Well, before the first
shot, Vaughn stumbled.

32:41.766 --> 32:43.086
Stumbled?

32:43.823 --> 32:47.267
Kids and old people stumble.
How did he stumble?

32:47.268 --> 32:48.571
I don't know. He just did.

32:48.572 --> 32:51.075
So he ate the wrong entree

32:51.076 --> 32:52.724
and avoided being poisoned,

32:52.725 --> 32:55.493
and then he stumbled at
just the right moment

32:55.494 --> 32:58.652
to avoid being shot by an
assassin through a window.

32:59.537 --> 33:01.399
Nobody's that lucky.

33:01.670 --> 33:03.409
What's going on here, Kate?

33:04.026 --> 33:06.421
He kissed me. Okay, Castle?

33:07.003 --> 33:08.241
He what?

33:08.243 --> 33:10.013
I think I have all I need here.

33:11.543 --> 33:12.847
Look, I'm not gonna lie to you.

33:12.848 --> 33:13.760
We were talking about you,

33:13.761 --> 33:14.966
we were talking about
relationships,

33:14.967 --> 33:16.614
and then he kissed me.

33:16.680 --> 33:18.658
But it didn't mean anything,

33:18.659 --> 33:20.078
at least not to me.

33:20.602 --> 33:21.579
Well, if he kissed you,

33:21.580 --> 33:24.248
why wouldn't you
just push him away?

33:26.850 --> 33:28.113
Oh.

33:29.466 --> 33:30.697
Which is...

33:31.295 --> 33:33.196
why he's not dead.

33:33.378 --> 33:34.508
Yo.

33:34.509 --> 33:36.184
The front desk clerk from
the hotel across the street

33:36.185 --> 33:38.055
positively identified
Thomas Barber.

33:38.056 --> 33:39.854
Said he was staying
under an assumed name.

33:39.855 --> 33:40.847
Any sign of him?

33:40.848 --> 33:42.495
No, but the phone
records from his room

33:42.496 --> 33:45.196
show that he made several
calls to a single number.

33:45.197 --> 33:47.465
You'll never guess who
Barber was calling.

33:48.707 --> 33:49.234
Ms. Paralti,

33:49.235 --> 33:51.371
some additional information
has come to light

33:51.372 --> 33:53.110
since you were last here.

33:53.930 --> 33:56.443
Like the fact that your father

33:56.444 --> 33:58.252
was in financial dire straights

33:58.253 --> 34:00.570
to the tune of $75,000.

34:00.571 --> 34:03.347
He nearly lost the family
farm, and then suddenly...

34:04.087 --> 34:05.533
he didn't.

34:05.844 --> 34:07.481
What does that have
to do with anything?

34:07.482 --> 34:08.337
Well, it may explain

34:08.338 --> 34:10.498
why you did something
you otherwise wouldn't.

34:10.498 --> 34:13.244
Like turn over a lethal
dose of neurotoxin

34:13.507 --> 34:16.400
in exchange for the money
to pay off that debt.

34:16.848 --> 34:19.023
I don't know what
you're talking about.

34:25.704 --> 34:26.688
What's this?

34:26.688 --> 34:29.527
The records of phone calls
made by Thomas Barber,

34:29.639 --> 34:31.127
a contract killer.

34:31.955 --> 34:33.714
Phone calls that he made to you.

34:37.931 --> 34:39.623
Look, please, I...

34:39.623 --> 34:42.013
I didn't know he was
gonna hurt anyone.

34:42.014 --> 34:43.666
He told me he was
from a rival lab,

34:43.667 --> 34:45.996
that they wanted
the patent first.

34:46.188 --> 34:49.261
I was mad at Eric, a--

34:49.533 --> 34:51.032
and I needed the money.

34:51.033 --> 34:53.306
- Where did you meet?
- We didn't.

34:53.666 --> 34:55.107
We talked on the phone,

34:55.108 --> 34:58.245
and I dropped the vial
at a prearranged place.

34:58.246 --> 34:59.858
How did you get paid?

34:59.859 --> 35:01.842
He told me to set up
an offshore account.

35:01.843 --> 35:04.894
The day after the drop,
the money just appeared.

35:07.453 --> 35:09.670
Hey, guys, check it out.

35:09.714 --> 35:11.671
The money arrived via
a wire transfer.

35:11.672 --> 35:13.225
With Cindy's cooperation,

35:13.226 --> 35:15.361
we were able to track it to
a Mexican energy company

35:15.362 --> 35:17.048
called Mexisolar.

35:17.049 --> 35:18.857
I heard Eric talk about this.

35:18.858 --> 35:21.186
What does a Mexican solar company
have to do with Eric Vaughn?

35:21.187 --> 35:22.135
He owns it.

35:22.136 --> 35:24.081
In fact, the night that
Arthur Felder was poisoned,

35:24.082 --> 35:27.230
he and Eric Vaughn were arranging
a site visit to the company

35:27.231 --> 35:29.086
because Felder wanted to
double-up his investment.

35:29.087 --> 35:30.136
So whatever's going on,

35:30.137 --> 35:31.722
it has to involve this company.

35:31.723 --> 35:32.947
Yeah, but, Beckett,
there's more.

35:32.948 --> 35:34.510
The person who authorized
the wire transfer

35:34.511 --> 35:36.745
into Cindy's account
was Eric Vaughn.

35:36.746 --> 35:39.086
It looks like he's
behind this whole thing.

35:39.096 --> 35:40.499
That can't be right.

35:40.500 --> 35:42.260
Yo. I just got off the phone

35:42.261 --> 35:43.973
with the consulate in Tijuana.

35:43.974 --> 35:45.573
This company--Mexisolar--

35:45.574 --> 35:46.854
it doesn't exist.

35:46.855 --> 35:49.387
They shut down the factory
in Mexicali months ago.

35:49.388 --> 35:51.734
What? This is making no sense.

35:51.735 --> 35:54.040
Au contraire, my friends.

35:54.041 --> 35:57.132
For the first time, this
is making perfect sense.

35:57.133 --> 35:58.791
Mexisolar...

35:59.008 --> 36:00.330
is a scam.

36:00.331 --> 36:02.491
Eric Vaughn's been using it
to fleece his investors.

36:02.492 --> 36:04.877
Castle, Vaughn is worth
a billion dollars.

36:04.878 --> 36:06.477
He's not gonna be running scams.

36:06.478 --> 36:08.218
Oh, Beckett.

36:08.219 --> 36:10.221
That's what they said
about Bernie Madoff.

36:10.222 --> 36:11.944
And like Madoff,
it's quite possible

36:11.945 --> 36:14.935
Vaughn's entire empire
is a house of cards.

36:14.936 --> 36:18.127
If Felder was going to visit
the Mexisolar factory,

36:18.128 --> 36:19.713
he'd have found out
about the scam.

36:19.714 --> 36:21.102
The house of cards
would collapse.

36:21.103 --> 36:22.127
Eric Vaughn couldn't have that.

36:22.128 --> 36:24.137
And what better way to
get away with murder

36:24.138 --> 36:27.167
than by making yourself look
to be the intended target?

36:27.168 --> 36:28.186
Don't you see?

36:28.187 --> 36:31.462
This entire thing is a charade.

36:34.227 --> 36:35.780
He's our killer.

36:36.482 --> 36:37.894
He played us.

36:38.088 --> 36:40.039
Well, mostly you.

36:53.236 --> 36:55.987
Of all the confessions
over all the years,

36:55.988 --> 36:57.201
this one...

36:57.202 --> 37:00.204
is going to hold a special
place in my heart.

37:03.015 --> 37:05.706
Castle, I'm going in there...

37:05.707 --> 37:07.057
Alone.

37:07.058 --> 37:07.848
But we're a team,

37:07.849 --> 37:10.592
and the universe demands
that I see him crumble.

37:10.593 --> 37:13.427
No, this one has to be
about putting Vaughn away

37:13.428 --> 37:14.785
and nothing else.

37:14.786 --> 37:17.207
And don't worry.
He will crumble.

37:19.763 --> 37:21.358
Leave the blinds open.

37:25.546 --> 37:28.210
I'm not sure which I should
be more disturbed about,

37:28.467 --> 37:29.869
that someone tried
to shoot my head off

37:29.870 --> 37:32.083
or that you pushed me
away when I kissed you.

37:32.084 --> 37:34.751
Uh, yeah, let's-- let's
talk about that,

37:34.752 --> 37:36.383
about these attempts
on your life,

37:36.384 --> 37:38.367
about Mexisolar.

37:38.467 --> 37:40.406
- Mexisolar?
- Your company.

37:40.407 --> 37:41.879
The one that doesn't exist.

37:41.880 --> 37:43.057
Of course it exists.

37:43.058 --> 37:45.310
I should know, I founded
it and invested millions.

37:45.311 --> 37:48.930
Right, so did Arthur Felder.
$30 million, to be exact.

37:48.931 --> 37:51.118
And now it's all gone.

37:54.122 --> 37:55.228
What is this, a joke?

37:55.229 --> 37:57.264
It's not a joke.
That's Mexisolar.

37:57.265 --> 37:58.574
No, no, this is crazy.

37:58.575 --> 37:59.991
The company's
completely solvent.

37:59.992 --> 38:01.265
Our factory is state-of-the-art.

38:01.266 --> 38:03.944
I've seen cash flow reports,
signed contracts.

38:04.791 --> 38:06.091
You mean like these?

38:06.092 --> 38:07.641
They're fraudulent.

38:07.971 --> 38:08.796
That's not possible.

38:08.797 --> 38:11.280
How is it not possible?
You signed them.

38:11.591 --> 38:13.369
Look, my staff give me
dozens of documents

38:13.370 --> 38:14.343
to sign every day.

38:14.344 --> 38:16.798
- It's your company.
- Yes.

38:16.799 --> 38:19.393
But I don't oversee
the day to day.

38:20.539 --> 38:21.950
Then who does?

38:24.374 --> 38:26.477
That is quite a
story, Detective.

38:26.478 --> 38:28.530
Oh, it is. It's got everything--

38:28.531 --> 38:30.849
larceny, betrayal, murder,

38:30.850 --> 38:33.810
and you looting millions
from Mexisolar.

38:33.811 --> 38:36.749
But since you had Eric Vaughn
signing off on all of the reports,

38:36.750 --> 38:38.675
no one took a hard
look at the company.

38:38.676 --> 38:41.023
Until Arthur Felder wanted to
see where his money was going.

38:41.024 --> 38:42.461
And you couldn't have
that, could you?

38:43.582 --> 38:45.177
Uh, you think I
killed Arthur Felder?

38:45.178 --> 38:47.686
Yes, but it was Vaughn
that you wanted dead.

38:47.687 --> 38:49.353
You knew that the paper trail
would make it look like

38:49.354 --> 38:50.969
he had embezzled money
from the company.

38:50.970 --> 38:52.418
So you hired a hit man,

38:52.419 --> 38:54.896
- except he killed the wrong guy.
- Oops.

38:55.363 --> 38:57.361
You have no proof
of any of this.

38:57.362 --> 38:58.777
Don't be so sure.

38:58.778 --> 39:00.789
The bank that transferred
the money to Cindy Paralti

39:00.790 --> 39:02.646
captured an IP address,

39:02.647 --> 39:05.585
and they traced it
back to your computer.

39:06.964 --> 39:08.949
It's over, David.

39:11.902 --> 39:14.752
Look, I didn't steal that money.

39:15.790 --> 39:19.679
I just made some bets with
it that underperformed.

39:19.865 --> 39:22.803
I-I-I took the new Mexisolar
funding, and I doubled down.

39:22.804 --> 39:25.210
I mean, that's what
Eric would have done.

39:26.941 --> 39:28.178
Damn it.

39:29.546 --> 39:31.372
The hole just getting
deeper and deeper.

39:33.399 --> 39:35.898
It all would've come out, and
it would've meant prison.

39:39.096 --> 39:40.635
I had no choice.

39:47.047 --> 39:49.219
It's amazing how you can
know someone for ten years

39:49.220 --> 39:51.074
and never really
know them at all...

39:51.579 --> 39:53.575
And know someone for
a few days, and...

39:53.576 --> 39:55.463
feel like you know them so well.

39:58.638 --> 40:00.335
Well, you will be happy to know

40:00.336 --> 40:01.935
that the feds caught
Thomas Barber

40:01.936 --> 40:04.521
trying to cross the
Canadian border, so...

40:05.730 --> 40:07.242
it's over.

40:08.722 --> 40:11.764
Yeah. I suppose it is.

40:14.246 --> 40:16.175
Take care, Eric.

40:16.309 --> 40:17.795
You, too, Kate.

40:29.532 --> 40:30.793
Leaving?

40:35.421 --> 40:37.038
You know...

40:37.356 --> 40:39.750
That's an extraordinary
woman you have there.

40:41.641 --> 40:42.925
I know.

40:43.893 --> 40:45.206
Do you?

40:56.437 --> 40:57.621
What is it, Castle?

40:57.622 --> 41:00.173
I was really comfortable
on that couch.

41:00.852 --> 41:01.875
There's something I need to do,

41:01.876 --> 41:04.674
something that...
you need to see.

41:05.537 --> 41:06.288
Wait.

41:06.289 --> 41:08.217
No, Ca-- I didn't say

41:08.218 --> 41:10.955
that I never want you to
play your game again.

41:10.956 --> 41:12.629
No, I know. Don't worry.
I have more cords.

41:12.630 --> 41:15.365
This is just symbolic.
But you're right.

41:15.366 --> 41:16.892
I've been taking
you for granted.

41:16.893 --> 41:18.864
But no longer. Tonight...

41:19.058 --> 41:20.436
it's all about me.

41:21.513 --> 41:23.618
- Shouldn't it be about me?
- Nope.

41:23.660 --> 41:25.791
'Cause tonight it's
all about me...

41:26.470 --> 41:28.128
giving you...

41:29.637 --> 41:32.367
a romantic full-body massage.

41:41.267 --> 41:42.295
Castle.

41:42.296 --> 41:43.591
Yeah?

41:46.300 --> 41:48.173
Where are we goin'?

41:49.110 --> 41:50.695
To the bedroom.

41:50.696 --> 41:52.846
Come on. You're gonna love this.
