00:01.167 --> 00:03.503
NARRATOR:<i> In the last episode</i>
<i>of </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:04.170 --> 00:06.131
PHIL: We have two officers down.

00:06.214 --> 00:10.427
Jack Halloran and Wallace Tubbs.
Halloran's the fatality.

00:10.510 --> 00:12.637
Ballistics just matched
the bullets to the .357.

00:12.721 --> 00:14.723
Well, who's it registered to?
Where's the name?

00:14.806 --> 00:16.975
Did you ever know a guy on the street
by the name of Billy Harris?

00:17.058 --> 00:19.477
What about Billy Harrison?
Squirrel Harrison.

00:19.561 --> 00:23.398
That is precisely the point
of First Strike Estates, Phil.

00:23.481 --> 00:25.191
It's survival with dignity.

00:25.275 --> 00:28.445
Have you thought about the future
of young Frank Jr. lately,

00:28.528 --> 00:30.071
vis-Ã -vis the unthinkable?

00:30.530 --> 00:32.407
He was paralyzed from the chest down.

00:32.949 --> 00:35.493
-His spine collapsed.
-Is there anything you can do about it?

00:35.577 --> 00:37.120
He's gonna die, Mr. Renko.

00:37.203 --> 00:39.414
NARRATOR:
<i>And now, tonight on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:40.915 --> 00:44.294
if there's any chance at all
that this is not the man who raped you...

00:44.377 --> 00:46.629
He was. I swear.

00:46.713 --> 00:49.674
Come on, would you rape somebody
after just having had sex?

00:49.758 --> 00:51.801
Me? I rather doubt it.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.470
I may be a little out of line here,

00:53.553 --> 00:57.557
but it seems to me you can't forgive J.D.,
'cause he got the same problem you had.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.059
Still have, Neal.

01:02.437 --> 01:03.480
PHIL:<i> Item 11.</i>

01:04.022 --> 01:07.650
Due apparently to the adverse
economic realities of ghetto life,

01:07.734 --> 01:10.528
not to mention spring's
more temperate clime,

01:11.196 --> 01:13.907
a number of the Hill's professional women

01:13.990 --> 01:18.787
have taken to transacting business
under the bushes--

01:18.870 --> 01:20.205
(laughing, chattering)

01:20.288 --> 01:23.958
Just inside the park's
117th Street entrance.

01:24.042 --> 01:25.251
MAN: Favorite place to be!

01:25.335 --> 01:27.754
PHIL: Yesterday, four individuals

01:27.837 --> 01:32.550
of the, uh, john persuasion
were found quite hapless

01:32.634 --> 01:33.885
and pants-less...

01:33.968 --> 01:35.762
(laughter)

01:35.845 --> 01:38.098
Under the flowering rhododendrons.

01:38.765 --> 01:42.060
Let's try and domesticate
that situation, shall we? Huh?

01:42.769 --> 01:47.315
Item 12 regards
the so-called "Wino Slasher,"

01:48.108 --> 01:53.363
who's been attempting
to, uh, turn our local skid-row population

01:53.863 --> 01:56.116
into an endangered species.

01:56.658 --> 01:59.369
To date, there have been
three dead and nine injured.

02:00.120 --> 02:03.498
Panic has become epidemic amongst
these denizens of the netherworld.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.543
Ergo, starting today,

02:07.252 --> 02:10.213
there will be a three-precinct
undercover operation in effect.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.799
Mick Belker will be staking out
for Hill Street.

02:13.341 --> 02:14.175
MAN: Right on, Mick.

02:15.718 --> 02:19.305
PHIL: Item 13,
the Jack Halloran Memorial Scholarship

02:19.389 --> 02:21.850
is being established
at Woodrow Wilson High

02:21.933 --> 02:26.312
for the scholar-athletes,
college aspirants...

02:28.523 --> 02:30.400
who best exemplifies

02:30.483 --> 02:32.861
the high ideals that Jack has stood for.

02:33.778 --> 02:37.031
You fellas know that Jack was
all-city halfback for two years running.

02:37.282 --> 02:38.283
MAN: Yeah, great guy.

02:39.159 --> 02:43.746
Anyway, all contributions, large or small,
will be very much appreciated.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.456
All right. That's it. Let's roll.

02:46.249 --> 02:49.627
And, hey, let's be careful out there, huh?

02:50.879 --> 02:53.006
-What's with J.D.?
-Had his Board of Rights yesterday.

02:53.089 --> 02:54.799
But when I called him up
last night he hadn't heard yet.

02:54.883 --> 02:57.510
-Where's Renko?
-His dad died a couple of hours ago.

02:59.804 --> 03:02.056
LEO: Oh, it's a gold card this month,
Maurice.

03:02.140 --> 03:03.725
Business must be pretty good.

03:03.808 --> 03:05.560
(whistling)

03:05.643 --> 03:10.273
Uh-oh, no can do, sport.
Expiration date, 12/81.

03:10.356 --> 03:11.566
Oh, no.

03:12.984 --> 03:14.903
Uh, third desk in the first row.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.031
MAN: Wilson.

03:20.408 --> 03:22.243
(whistling)

03:35.340 --> 03:40.136
A nuclear holocaust may simply not be
the no-win situation many describe, Ray.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.723
Think about it.
Where will the bombs strike?

03:44.891 --> 03:45.725
The city.

03:46.684 --> 03:52.315
We are talking about nuclear bulldozing
of genetic tide pools,<i> mon hombre,</i>

03:52.899 --> 03:57.654
while you and I could be sitting
and watching first-run movies

03:57.737 --> 04:02.116
in a 200-seat theater in the basement
of First Strike Estates.

04:03.743 --> 04:04.786
Think about it, Ray.

04:05.411 --> 04:08.456
No waiting in lines,
a good selection of Cantinflas films.

04:08.539 --> 04:10.875
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:11.459 --> 04:13.086
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

04:13.169 --> 04:16.923
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:17.006 --> 04:18.716
(sirens wailing)

04:24.180 --> 04:28.101
(theme music playing)

05:55.855 --> 05:57.648
Speaking of genetic tide pools,

05:57.732 --> 06:00.151
how did you make out
at Gabriel's Gate the other night?

06:00.777 --> 06:03.780
Um, tell you the truth,
those meat racks are not my kind of place.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.156
There's too much desperation.

06:05.531 --> 06:09.827
You know, I'm making a pretty good
adjustment to, uh, my single life now.

06:10.161 --> 06:12.455
To tell you the truth, I don't have
to hang off a bar every night.

06:12.955 --> 06:14.916
Now, that, by me, is a man.

06:16.042 --> 06:19.003
You want to talk about a man?
I want to talk about flowers.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.755
Forget about it. It's no big deal.

06:20.838 --> 06:21.964
What do you mean it's no big deal?

06:22.048 --> 06:24.801
-A $60 bouquet of flowers?
-I said it was no big deal.

06:24.884 --> 06:27.303
Luce, come on.
There had to be a dozen roses in there.

06:27.387 --> 06:28.846
-That's 40 bucks right there.
-Oh, forget it.

06:30.014 --> 06:32.016
Say, you guys,
I'm gonna swing by the hospital.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.560
You, uh, want to tell Renko anything?

06:34.644 --> 06:38.773
Hill, why don't you give these to Renko?
From all the guys at Hill Street.

06:38.940 --> 06:41.150
Oh, wow, Leo. That's really sweet.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.945
-Where'd you get 'em?
-Oh, well, some of us chipped in.

06:45.363 --> 06:48.491
Hey, man, that's real sweet of you guys.
You know, Renko will appreciate that.

06:49.075 --> 06:49.909
Thanks.

06:50.827 --> 06:53.788
Pick up dry cleaning, check.
Buy swimsuit, check.

06:54.038 --> 06:56.749
Suntan lotion, check.
Pay rent in advance, check.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.751
That's it. All set. You packed?

06:59.127 --> 07:03.214
You came all the way up here to lord
your vacation-planning efficiency over me?

07:03.714 --> 07:05.508
Actually, I've got a bit of business.

07:05.591 --> 07:07.969
Drew a rape suspect in the office pool
this morning.

07:08.052 --> 07:10.930
Charter member, no doubt,
of the local ravage-and-pillage set.

07:11.013 --> 07:14.517
Oh, that's a particularly cavalier
attitude this morning, counselor.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.438
Just can't believe we're actually
getting out of this place tonight.

07:18.855 --> 07:21.149
-We meet seven o'clock, your place.
-You got it.

07:26.028 --> 07:26.946
Ms. Davenport.

07:27.989 --> 07:29.699
McKay from Internal Affairs called.

07:30.366 --> 07:33.161
LaRue has been cleared of charges
by his Board of Rights.

07:33.703 --> 07:35.204
We can have him back if we want.

07:36.956 --> 07:39.292
-I think not.
-Are you sure, Frank?

07:39.959 --> 07:43.129
He did the job when we needed it
on Jack Halloran's shooter.

07:43.212 --> 07:45.590
He's a little too unpredictable
for my taste, Ray.

07:46.841 --> 07:47.675
Okay.

07:47.758 --> 07:49.927
I punched out from the drugstore
at nine o'clock.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.805
I went over to Holland House for a beer,
you know, on the way home,

07:52.889 --> 07:54.015
and that's where I met Rona.

07:54.098 --> 07:56.017
-Last name?
-DONALD: I don't even know.

07:56.100 --> 07:58.644
After about an hour,
we went back to her place,

07:58.811 --> 08:01.189
where I stayed
until it was close to 12:30.

08:01.272 --> 08:03.399
I know, because that's when
she kicked me out.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.776
I walked a couple of blocks
back toward my house,

08:05.860 --> 08:09.655
and I stopped at a corner store to pick up
a pack of smokes and-and an ice-cream bar.

08:10.448 --> 08:11.449
And it was after that.

08:11.782 --> 08:14.702
The cops drove up, they pulled me over,
they dragged me over to the car,

08:14.785 --> 08:18.289
and there was this girl in there, right,
that I'd never seen in my life before.

08:18.372 --> 08:21.459
And they said, "Is it him?
Is this the guy? Is this the one?"

08:21.709 --> 08:23.753
And she pointed at me
and started screaming.

08:23.836 --> 08:26.506
Why didn't you ask to go back
to Rona's to prove your alibi?

08:26.589 --> 08:30.968
I did! And they-they said,
"Tell it to your lawyer." (sighs)

08:33.179 --> 08:36.265
What if I told you, Donald,
just hypothetically,

08:37.850 --> 08:40.520
that if you wanted to plead guilty
to a lesser charge--

08:40.895 --> 08:42.230
say, sexual abuse--

08:42.980 --> 08:47.276
it might be possible to get you probation
or minimal jail time as a first offender,

08:47.652 --> 08:50.530
but that if you insisted
on going to trial and lost,

08:50.821 --> 08:52.990
you could do 10 years or more in prison?

08:53.449 --> 08:56.369
Wait I-I thought I had a right to a trial.

08:56.994 --> 08:57.828
You do.

08:58.579 --> 09:02.083
But our legal system exacts a high price
for your exercise of it.

09:03.125 --> 09:05.711
(scoffing) This is funny.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.590
I mean, I want to be a lawyer.

09:09.674 --> 09:13.928
I'm saving up now, so I can do prelaw
at City College and then go to law school.

09:15.137 --> 09:16.264
But I guess you can't be a lawyer

09:16.347 --> 09:18.766
if you got a criminal record
for rape assault, can you?

09:18.849 --> 09:20.393
No. You can't.

09:21.644 --> 09:25.064
Come on! Would you rape somebody
four blocks from your house?

09:25.856 --> 09:28.901
Frankly, you'd have to be pretty stupid.
But it's been done.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.779
Would you rape somebody
after just having had sex?

09:31.862 --> 09:33.906
Me? I rather doubt it.

09:35.783 --> 09:38.119
Look, I don't know much about the courts,

09:38.202 --> 09:40.496
and-- and how all that works yet,
Miss Davenport.

09:40.580 --> 09:44.917
But I would go to jail for 10 years,
20 years, my whole life,

09:45.001 --> 09:47.878
before I stood up and said I did something
like that that I didn't do.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.422
-Donald--
-Now, I mean,

09:49.505 --> 09:52.174
aren't you supposed to be the one
who's gonna help me prove I'm innocent?

09:53.467 --> 09:54.552
Yes, I am.

09:55.094 --> 09:56.596
Well, I don't want a criminal record--

09:57.680 --> 10:00.182
not even for spitting on the sidewalk,
not if I didn't do it.

10:01.183 --> 10:02.560
Please, sit down.

10:04.770 --> 10:06.564
(exhales deeply)

10:06.897 --> 10:11.027
Look, Donald, some of what you're saying
makes a certain amount of sense.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.325
Do you think you could remember
this Rona's apartment number?

10:18.951 --> 10:19.952
Um,

10:21.912 --> 10:23.414
third floor, top of the landing.

10:25.541 --> 10:27.043
You know something, Donald Lilly?

10:28.085 --> 10:30.755
You could very possibly
mess up my vacation.

10:32.715 --> 10:33.841
(papers rustling)

10:35.468 --> 10:37.511
What do you mean,
you can't release the body yet?

10:37.595 --> 10:39.263
That's my daddy we're talking about.

10:39.347 --> 10:40.806
I'm sorry, Mr. Renko.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.266
But since his admitting physician

10:42.350 --> 10:45.227
forgot to sign the death certificate,
and it being a Wednesday--

10:45.311 --> 10:46.812
Well, what the hell difference
does that make?

10:46.896 --> 10:47.980
Just call him up!

10:48.064 --> 10:51.233
His secretary believes
he's on the front nine at Crestview.

10:51.734 --> 10:54.862
-WOMAN (on P.A.):<i> Dr. Anderson, 1301.</i>
-Golf, Mr. Renko.

10:55.321 --> 10:56.489
Can't anybody else sign this?

10:56.572 --> 10:58.658
Tracy, will you just be quiet
and let me handle this?

10:59.116 --> 11:00.660
Now, can't anybody else sign this?

11:00.743 --> 11:03.829
Only the medical examiner.
I paged him 10 minutes ago.

11:04.288 --> 11:05.748
Do we have a problem here, Lori?

11:06.165 --> 11:09.710
Hmm, not if you're the medical examiner.
Would you just sign this here, please?

11:10.753 --> 11:13.631
WOMAN (on P.A.):
<i>Nurse Byron, patient 2403.</i>

11:13.839 --> 11:16.967
I'm sorry, Mr. Renko.
I can't make heads or tails of this.

11:17.051 --> 11:19.095
So what? He's dead, isn't he?

11:19.178 --> 11:22.932
Well, with no clear cause of death,
I can't sign this without an autopsy.

11:23.015 --> 11:25.601
-An autopsy will take two or three days.
-Autopsy?

11:25.685 --> 11:29.855
That poor old man was in and out of this
hospital with cancer for three months.

11:30.815 --> 11:32.566
Well, I suggest you wait
for your own doctor.

11:32.650 --> 11:35.569
I can't, he's still not off
the back nine yet.

11:35.653 --> 11:36.987
-(taps counter)
-Well, it's his fault

11:37.071 --> 11:38.739
the certificate
isn't signed, not mine.

11:38.823 --> 11:40.533
Will you come here
and talk to me here, pal?

11:41.492 --> 11:44.912
Now, you know those little M.E. tags
you have on the back of your car?

11:45.538 --> 11:49.375
Well, how would you feel if every time
you parked in front of a fire hydrant

11:49.709 --> 11:52.670
or in an illegal zone
without a medical emergency,

11:52.753 --> 11:55.589
you came out and found out that some cop
had cited your car?

11:55.673 --> 11:58.300
You know what I'm talking about?
You wouldn't feel too good, would you?

11:58.384 --> 12:01.929
So what I'm asking for here is a little
professional mutual "reprocosity,"

12:02.012 --> 12:02.888
if you get my meaning.

12:03.389 --> 12:04.223
(mouths word)

12:05.182 --> 12:08.227
-(papers rustling)
-WOMAN (on P.A.):<i> Dr. Andrews, ER, stat.</i>

12:08.310 --> 12:09.854
<i>Dr. Andrews.</i>

12:11.439 --> 12:14.650
Hey, cowboy.
This is from everyone at the station.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.527
I'm really sorry about your dad.

12:18.654 --> 12:19.530
Thanks, Bobby.

12:20.656 --> 12:22.950
Thanks, Bobby.
That's real nice of you guys.

12:23.242 --> 12:25.911
FARNSWORTH: Okay, so this one
is your Westward Ho.

12:25.995 --> 12:26.829
-(organ playing)
-Excuse me.

12:26.912 --> 12:30.541
And it's got your genuine
synthetic silk lining,

12:31.333 --> 12:33.544
and your scenes of old Abilene,

12:34.879 --> 12:36.714
and your frontier-like handles.

12:37.465 --> 12:41.093
It's, uh, one of your better buys
in the under-$3,000 range.

12:41.719 --> 12:45.222
-Uh, well, you know, I--
-(Farnsworth chuckling)

12:45.306 --> 12:47.850
Look, let me give you
the straight poop, Mr. Renko.

12:48.225 --> 12:52.480
Any one of these babies can do the job
for you, including your bare-bones model.

12:52.563 --> 12:53.439
No pun intended.

12:54.273 --> 12:57.526
What a lot of your funeral parlors do is,
they like to lay on the guilt--

12:58.152 --> 12:59.820
like if you don't spend
more than you can afford,

12:59.904 --> 13:01.781
it means you didn't
love your father enough.

13:03.240 --> 13:04.950
I think that's a lot of baloney.

13:05.868 --> 13:08.412
Me? I'm a retired shoe salesman.

13:08.496 --> 13:11.248
I'm only doing this because
I like to be with people.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.627
So what it boils down to is this:

13:14.710 --> 13:17.379
You can go for your basic Simulon 200.

13:18.380 --> 13:21.884
The only trouble is, at the funeral people
are gonna think you're a cheap slob.

13:22.259 --> 13:26.555
Now all you gotta do is ask yourself,
do you care what people think?

13:27.932 --> 13:29.141
What about cremation?

13:34.146 --> 13:37.858
Well-- (sighs) yes, that-- that--
that is another alternative.

13:37.942 --> 13:41.487
But, um, just let me show you
something in bronze for a second.

13:42.780 --> 13:44.698
This is your Herbert Hoover.

13:45.074 --> 13:48.828
No doubt about it--
It's your Cadillac of caskets.

13:49.286 --> 13:51.497
Enormously popular
with many of your people, sir.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.126
Mr. Farnsworth.

13:57.294 --> 14:01.131
-Um, excuse us, please. Yes?
-(whispering, indistinct)

14:02.508 --> 14:05.302
FARNSWORTH: What? I don't believe it!

14:05.386 --> 14:07.638
(whispering, indistinct) Huh.

14:07.930 --> 14:09.723
(nervous chuckle)

14:09.807 --> 14:11.809
(sighs)

14:12.476 --> 14:16.146
Mr. Renko, Miss Renko, uh-- (laughing)

14:16.564 --> 14:18.774
Something terribly embarrassing
has just happened.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.527
Uh, you see,

14:21.610 --> 14:25.030
our regular call car that makes
the hospital pickups is, uh--

14:25.739 --> 14:27.116
It's in the transmission shop,

14:28.117 --> 14:31.161
and we've been using
my son's brand-new van.

14:31.328 --> 14:33.080
-RENKO: I understand.
-Uh-huh.

14:33.455 --> 14:37.167
And, unfortunately, it just got stolen
right out of our own parking lot here.

14:37.626 --> 14:40.045
Well, if you want, me and my partner here

14:40.129 --> 14:42.631
could-- could write it up for you,
Mr. Farnsworth,

14:42.715 --> 14:44.508
right after we choose the casket here.

14:45.551 --> 14:46.886
Bad news for the kid, huh?

14:47.261 --> 14:48.137
Uh-huh.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.639
Uh, well, actually, Mr. Renko,

14:50.723 --> 14:52.975
it's kind of bad news
for your father, too.

14:53.517 --> 14:55.561
How bad can it be? The guy's already dead.

14:56.770 --> 14:57.605
Uh-huh.

14:58.439 --> 15:00.858
Well, you see, he was still inside the van
when it was stolen.

15:03.319 --> 15:06.113
Oh, Lordy, they've stolen my daddy.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.076
(mumbling)

15:14.496 --> 15:16.332
I'll tell you the real secret, my friend.

15:18.709 --> 15:19.710
The real secret--

15:20.920 --> 15:22.129
The secret to real

15:23.964 --> 15:25.007
fine cooking

15:26.884 --> 15:28.344
is a good oak wood fire,

15:30.220 --> 15:31.096
and fresh,

15:32.014 --> 15:33.390
natural ingredients.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.104
(coughs)

15:39.730 --> 15:41.231
You know where I get the wood
for that fire?

15:41.315 --> 15:42.524
Where?

15:42.608 --> 15:45.778
After a big wind,
I go down to Delaware Park, gather it up.

15:45.861 --> 15:48.155
And then I dry-cure it
down by that heat vent

15:48.238 --> 15:50.199
behind the Chinese grocery down the alley.

15:51.367 --> 15:52.326
Smells terrific.

15:54.286 --> 15:56.705
Well, that, my friend, is because
it has been marinating

15:56.789 --> 15:59.541
in my special vinaigrette sauce
all morning long.

16:00.292 --> 16:01.710
It's my special sauce--

16:02.169 --> 16:04.088
a little salt, a little basil,

16:04.463 --> 16:05.673
a little port...

16:06.340 --> 16:08.384
-(grunts, chuckles)
-Like this.

16:08.592 --> 16:12.054
Oh, yeah, and I stole a couple of those
cellophane bags of salad dressing

16:12.137 --> 16:14.348
you get at the bus station coffee shop,
you know?

16:18.644 --> 16:19.478
(sighs)

16:22.523 --> 16:25.067
Oh. You know what I think?

16:28.028 --> 16:33.701
I think Carlotta and Puddles
should join us for a little lunch.

16:33.784 --> 16:34.702
Do you like kitties?

16:36.495 --> 16:37.621
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

16:38.205 --> 16:39.123
Hold this. (groans)

16:41.792 --> 16:43.836
(train horn blowing in distance)

16:43.919 --> 16:46.338
-Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
-(meowing)

16:49.550 --> 16:52.553
(man coughing)

16:52.636 --> 16:55.723
This is really nice. I mean, really nice.

16:56.098 --> 16:57.016
What's nice?

16:57.099 --> 17:01.854
Everything is nice.
Uh, the barbecue with the oak wood,

17:01.937 --> 17:05.983
and the heat vent down there,
and Carlotta and Puddles.

17:06.775 --> 17:09.153
Your life, it's nice.

17:10.154 --> 17:12.573
Thank you. And you ain't even<i> et </i>yet.

17:13.323 --> 17:16.118
Try some of this. Yeah, this is ready.

17:17.578 --> 17:18.746
-Yeah!
-Aah!

17:22.541 --> 17:23.625
-Mm!
-Ahh!

17:23.709 --> 17:24.835
This is great!

17:30.799 --> 17:31.925
I mean it, Farley.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.803
This is some of the best chicken
I ever had.

17:35.387 --> 17:38.015
Chicken? Who said anything about chicken?

17:38.682 --> 17:40.059
BELKER: What do you mean?
This isn't chicken?

17:40.142 --> 17:41.060
(chuckles)

17:42.895 --> 17:45.481
-(jingling)
-(imitates cat screeching)

17:46.273 --> 17:47.691
(laughs)

17:50.444 --> 17:53.405
CALLETANO: What kind of animals
would steal a man's father?

17:53.489 --> 17:55.365
I highly doubt
that it was intentional, Ray.

17:55.449 --> 17:58.410
They probably just ripped the van off
without seeing the body in the back.

17:58.494 --> 18:01.872
Yeah, well, I heard there's Caribbean
types who steal corpses now and then

18:01.955 --> 18:03.832
and use them for religious rituals.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.919
Six hundred and 95 dollars
and 50<i> centavos.</i>

18:07.002 --> 18:11.298
That is the current retail price
for your freshly deceased Homo sapien

18:11.548 --> 18:14.426
on the black-market
organ-transplant circuit.

18:15.135 --> 18:17.221
That is not even counting
your mineral wealth.

18:17.763 --> 18:21.100
Why, you, uh-- you grind up a femur there,
and you get about four pounds

18:21.183 --> 18:24.103
of high-grade calcium phosphate
fertilizer.

18:25.145 --> 18:26.939
I'll check with Burglary Auto on that.

18:29.983 --> 18:31.485
I gotta talk to you, Lieutenant.

18:31.735 --> 18:32.569
All right.

18:36.990 --> 18:41.328
Okay. Who is the wise guy?

18:43.372 --> 18:45.415
You really think
he could be sold for parts?

18:45.499 --> 18:50.295
Oh, well, corneas alone are going upwards
to $70 a gram, Schnitz.

18:50.379 --> 18:52.673
Howard, the man's body
was riddled with cancer.

18:52.756 --> 18:53.590
Oh.

18:55.717 --> 18:57.845
Well, there's always
the third-world markets.

18:59.847 --> 19:01.265
We're doing everything we can.

19:01.348 --> 19:03.600
Did you put out an APB on the vehicle?

19:03.892 --> 19:06.395
Well, not yet,
but if you think it would help--

19:06.478 --> 19:10.524
Damn it, Lieutenant! How would you feel
if it was your daddy bouncing around--

19:10.607 --> 19:12.151
in the back of some hot van somewhere?

19:12.234 --> 19:13.443
-(laughter)
-RENKO: Hey!

19:13.527 --> 19:17.364
What are you laughing at?
What the hell is so funny about all this?

19:17.447 --> 19:18.782
Look at this. Do you believe this?

19:18.866 --> 19:20.617
She misspelled "misdemeanor."

19:20.701 --> 19:22.995
-Look at that.
-She forgot the "A," Renko. (laughs)

19:24.580 --> 19:25.914
Renko, I'm sorry, man.

19:26.957 --> 19:30.210
-Would you help me get out of this mess?
-I don't believe you guys.

19:30.294 --> 19:32.296
I swear. Isn't anything sacred?

19:40.470 --> 19:41.471
(man clears throat)

19:43.724 --> 19:45.475
-Frank, have you got a minute?
-Yeah.

19:46.935 --> 19:47.978
You're still here?

19:48.061 --> 19:50.022
Just finished the preliminaries
with my client.

19:50.105 --> 19:53.400
Over two hours, wasn't it?
I'd say he's getting his money's worth.

19:53.483 --> 19:55.694
Frank, I've got an unusual situation here.

19:55.986 --> 19:58.322
I can't say for certain Donald Lilly
is innocent,

19:58.864 --> 20:01.158
but I'm giving him everything I'm worth
till the verdict's in.

20:01.783 --> 20:03.243
Considering your current pessimism,

20:03.327 --> 20:05.078
he must have done
some fast talking in there.

20:05.162 --> 20:08.624
No priors, no arrests--
not even an outstanding traffic ticket.

20:09.499 --> 20:11.752
Full academic scholarship
to Larchmont J.C.

20:11.835 --> 20:14.838
with a 3.5 average
after three straight semesters,

20:15.130 --> 20:17.633
in addition to holding down
a 30-hour-a-week night job

20:17.716 --> 20:18.717
at a midtown drugstore.

20:19.801 --> 20:22.471
I'll admit it's not your standard
sex-offender profile.

20:22.888 --> 20:24.181
JOYCE: He also has an alibi.

20:24.973 --> 20:28.769
He stopped for a beer after work
at the Holland House on East Utica.

20:28.852 --> 20:31.313
He met a lady, Black, mid-20s.

20:32.481 --> 20:34.149
They went to her apartment
about an hour later.

20:34.233 --> 20:37.527
He stayed until the channel 8
late show ended, that's 12:30.

20:37.903 --> 20:40.739
That's 25 minutes after
the Hernandez girl was assaulted.

20:41.031 --> 20:41.865
Lady have a name?

20:42.241 --> 20:43.825
Rona. He didn't get the last name.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.285
Will you check it out?

20:45.369 --> 20:46.745
Sure. Henry?

20:47.120 --> 20:48.622
Could I talk to you for a minute?

20:48.705 --> 20:51.124
Why did you wait until now
to tell me about this alibi?

20:51.833 --> 20:54.294
Would you have sat through
the circumstantials if I had?

20:56.088 --> 20:56.922
Come on, Henry.

21:04.638 --> 21:08.600
(chattering)

21:09.268 --> 21:10.811
Nope. Never seen him before.

21:12.980 --> 21:13.814
Why?

21:14.231 --> 21:15.524
He claims he was in this apartment

21:15.607 --> 21:18.694
with a woman named Rona
till about 12:30 last night.

21:18.777 --> 21:20.153
(laughs) I'm sorry, Officer.

21:20.237 --> 21:22.281
You must have the wrong building
or something.

21:25.242 --> 21:30.872
Do you ever frequent a-- a bar down on
East Utica called the Holland House?

21:31.123 --> 21:31.957
No.

21:32.791 --> 21:36.253
Well, I've been there before,
maybe just once or twice.

21:38.505 --> 21:39.631
What's the guy done?

21:39.715 --> 21:42.592
He was arrested for a rape assault
that occurred around midnight

21:42.676 --> 21:44.052
about three blocks from here.

21:46.722 --> 21:50.767
(clicks tongue) You weren't at that bar
last night, by any chance?

21:51.393 --> 21:55.230
Hey, I was home last night--
alone the whole night.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.941
(chuckles) You know, it--

21:59.067 --> 22:01.361
it'd really help my job if you could
verify that, Miss Dunford.

22:01.445 --> 22:02.779
I don't have to verify anything.

22:03.405 --> 22:05.324
Now-- (laughs) I already told you.

22:05.949 --> 22:09.036
My name isn't Rona,
and I've never seen that guy before.

22:09.119 --> 22:12.748
Besides which, I am not in the habit
of picking up strangers in bars.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.627
-(door slams)
-Thank you, ma'am.

22:17.711 --> 22:20.047
(horn honks)

22:24.301 --> 22:28.597
Some hot dog sends you 75 bucks worth
of roses that you throw in the trash can,

22:28.889 --> 22:31.058
and you won't even talk
to your own partner about it?

22:31.141 --> 22:35.187
Unlike some people,
I like to keep my personal life personal.

22:35.270 --> 22:37.105
-Okay?
-All right.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.398
If it's not the optometrist,

22:38.482 --> 22:41.068
it has to be somebody you met
in the last three or four weeks.

22:41.151 --> 22:42.235
-Right?
-Joe.

22:43.070 --> 22:44.613
What is it with this guy, huh?

22:44.696 --> 22:46.865
Is he some kind of sex maniac,
a drug addict or what?

22:46.948 --> 22:49.826
Joe, he's married, okay?
Are you satisfied now?

22:49.910 --> 22:51.495
He's married. He has kids.

22:52.371 --> 22:55.916
We've been going out for a month,
and the lousy creep told me

22:55.999 --> 22:57.334
-for the first time last night.
-WOMAN (on radio):<i> All units.</i>

22:57.417 --> 22:58.960
<i>All frequencies, stand by.</i>

22:59.169 --> 23:02.464
<i>We have a unit in pursuit</i>
<i>of a possible stolen vehicle.</i>

23:02.547 --> 23:05.467
<i>Gray Dodge Van,</i>
<i>northbound on Elmwood and Allen.</i>

23:05.634 --> 23:09.596
<i>License number David-Michael-Ocean-1-1-2.</i>

23:09.679 --> 23:11.306
That's Renko's dad.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.683
(siren wailing)

23:44.965 --> 23:45.966
We got him!

24:00.230 --> 24:01.648
(chattering on police radio)

24:02.649 --> 24:05.735
Oh, Lord.
What have they done with my daddy?

24:11.616 --> 24:14.870
Frank, I talked to Goldblume.
Apparently the alibi's a washout.

24:16.288 --> 24:20.208
Look, Frank, uh,
I just don't think I can leave tonight.

24:21.668 --> 24:22.502
Joyce.

24:24.254 --> 24:27.257
We've been planning this vacation
for over three months.

24:29.301 --> 24:30.719
Listen,
at the risk of seeming insensitive,

24:30.802 --> 24:33.472
couldn't you turn this Donald Lilly over
to somebody else in your office?

24:33.555 --> 24:36.641
No offense, counselor, but you're not
the only public defender in town.

24:36.725 --> 24:38.727
I've got a feeling for this kid, Frank.

24:39.060 --> 24:40.770
I can't fly off to some beach
in Saint Croix

24:40.854 --> 24:44.232
wondering if some overworked P.D.'s
going to see it the same way I do.

24:45.025 --> 24:47.068
You're aware, no doubt,
who's prosecuting this case.

24:47.152 --> 24:49.529
Oh, yeah. Gail Kennedy.

24:49.821 --> 24:51.656
10-0 for the season, Frank.

24:52.699 --> 24:55.368
(sighs) She's made a career
on cases like this.

24:56.369 --> 24:59.206
Her rape-assault unit's
just about the toughest in the state.

24:59.623 --> 25:00.999
They'll have my client indicted

25:01.082 --> 25:04.127
and looking at five years hard time
within 72 hours.

25:04.920 --> 25:08.590
Couldn't you talk to her?
Maybe she'd be open to negotiation.

25:09.925 --> 25:12.552
You don't plea-bargain a kid
with a spotless record.

25:13.803 --> 25:15.889
You know, given the realities
of the process,

25:15.972 --> 25:17.599
this kid's in a worse legal position

25:17.682 --> 25:21.353
than 99 percent of your truly hard-core
cases that come through here.

25:21.436 --> 25:23.313
At least with them I have room to operate.

25:24.272 --> 25:26.733
With Donald Lilly,
either I win an early dismissal,

25:26.816 --> 25:29.986
or I'm forced to take him all the way
to trial and throw the dice.

25:30.070 --> 25:30.904
And if you lose?

25:32.614 --> 25:33.615
I'd like a lineup, Frank.

25:33.698 --> 25:37.202
Joyce, the victim I.D.'d him
on the scene less than 12 hours ago.

25:37.869 --> 25:39.871
Thirty minutes after the event

25:40.539 --> 25:43.250
in a highly emotional state
on a darkened street corner,

25:43.333 --> 25:47.045
with, no doubt, the well-intentioned
encouragement of two police officers.

25:47.128 --> 25:49.714
Are you sure this is in the best interest
of your client?

25:51.633 --> 25:52.467
No.

25:53.635 --> 25:55.887
But at this point,
I don't have much choice, do I?

25:57.055 --> 25:59.975
Captain, I'd like you to tell me
why you permitted this lineup.

26:00.392 --> 26:03.270
The case isn't as cut-and-dried
as it used to be.

26:03.520 --> 26:05.355
Thank you for being so explicit.

26:06.273 --> 26:09.025
I know about your client's alibi.
I know it didn't pan out.

26:09.109 --> 26:13.280
If you have a good reason for badgering
Maria Hernandez, I want to hear it.

26:13.363 --> 26:15.323
We think she accused the wrong man.

26:16.616 --> 26:20.203
After picking him off the streets
30 minutes after the assault?

26:20.370 --> 26:23.206
Come on, Gail.
Who else did she have to choose from?

26:23.290 --> 26:25.125
I don't know, Joyce. I wasn't there.

26:25.667 --> 26:27.627
But I can see what's going on here.

26:28.086 --> 26:31.131
Full cooperation of the police department
is a good thing to have.

26:31.214 --> 26:36.011
The police department is anxious
that justice be done, Ms. Kennedy.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.972
Excuse me, Frank. Maria Hernandez is here.

26:39.055 --> 26:41.766
I'd better see a decent spread
on that platform.

26:45.645 --> 26:47.689
CALLETANO: Number five, face forward.

26:51.526 --> 26:52.694
Spread out.

26:53.820 --> 26:56.740
Number three, take your hands
out of your pockets.

27:01.119 --> 27:03.038
There's nothing to be afraid of.

27:03.830 --> 27:05.457
Take a good look.

27:07.208 --> 27:09.586
It's him. That one.

27:11.004 --> 27:12.422
-FRANK: The number.
-Four.

27:13.548 --> 27:14.424
Are you sure?

27:14.799 --> 27:15.634
Yes.

27:19.763 --> 27:20.722
It's all right.

27:28.188 --> 27:32.817
(man speaking Spanish)

27:41.368 --> 27:43.036
-(speaking in Spanish)
<i>-SÃ­, papÃ¡.</i>

27:43.119 --> 27:45.288
(shouting in Spanish)

27:45.372 --> 27:46.623
-(grunting, shouting)
-Wait!

27:54.631 --> 27:56.591
Hey, man, get him off me, man!

28:04.766 --> 28:10.730
(shouting in Spanish)

28:13.233 --> 28:14.275
(speaking in Spanish)

28:17.112 --> 28:21.491
The police--
they are on the side of the Blacks.

28:21.991 --> 28:25.412
You-- You do this to your own people?

28:26.162 --> 28:29.749
(speaking in Spanish)

28:34.796 --> 28:37.090
(chattering)

28:46.975 --> 28:48.560
-Hey, babe.
-Hey, Neal.

28:49.394 --> 28:51.938
-They said you were down here.
-Yeah, just cleaning out my locker.

28:53.064 --> 28:55.024
-Yeah, I heard about the Board of Rights.
-Yeah.

28:55.525 --> 28:57.444
-It's nice having that monkey off my back.
-Hmm!

28:57.861 --> 29:00.947
Hey, listen, I really appreciate
what you said about me down there,

29:01.030 --> 29:02.907
about me helping out
with the Halloran case and all.

29:02.991 --> 29:05.702
Hey, you did it, babe.
All I did was tell 'em about it.

29:07.370 --> 29:09.330
-So what's next?
-I don't know.

29:09.414 --> 29:11.082
I'm still assigned to the motor pool.

29:11.291 --> 29:13.752
I think I'm gonna put in
for assignment out of Division.

29:14.002 --> 29:17.422
They turn me down, I'm gonna just declare
free agency and shop the league.

29:18.506 --> 29:19.674
Have you talked to Furillo?

29:22.677 --> 29:24.012
The man doesn't like me, Neal.

29:25.597 --> 29:26.806
And he doesn't trust me.

29:28.308 --> 29:31.728
Hell, I haven't given him
much reason to, have I?

29:33.855 --> 29:37.442
I got nobody but me to blame for this,
and I'll live with it.

29:42.822 --> 29:44.824
MAN (on TV):<i> Contestant number one,</i>
<i>are you ready?</i>

29:47.243 --> 29:50.330
Miss Dunford, Sergeant Goldblume.
I'd very much like to talk to you again.

29:50.705 --> 29:53.082
Why? I told you this morning
I didn't know the guy.

29:53.166 --> 29:55.043
I remember what you told me.
That's what I want to talk to you about.

29:55.418 --> 29:56.252
Help--

29:57.212 --> 29:59.047
Help me, and I promise
I won't bother you again.

30:00.215 --> 30:02.258
All right. Wait a minute.
I'll come out there.

30:06.721 --> 30:08.139
Make it quick. I'm fixing dinner.

30:08.473 --> 30:11.059
I went to the bar where Donald Lilly says
he met you last night.

30:11.142 --> 30:12.977
I only had to give your
description to the bartender.

30:13.061 --> 30:15.522
Just give me a half a minute
of your time, Miss Dunford.

30:17.649 --> 30:20.151
He says you've been in there before.
Couple times this week, in fact.

30:20.235 --> 30:21.069
He's a liar.

30:22.779 --> 30:24.447
That makes two liars you've told me about.

30:24.531 --> 30:26.783
Look, why don't you just
leave me alone, huh?

30:26.866 --> 30:28.201
I didn't do anything.

30:28.284 --> 30:32.372
Look, lady, a kid's life is at stake here.
All we want is the truth.

30:34.415 --> 30:35.500
But, frankly, I gotta tell ya,

30:35.583 --> 30:38.127
if you got something you're trying to hide
from that guy in there,

30:39.295 --> 30:42.006
it's not gonna be a secret much longer
if Donald Lilly's case goes to trial,

30:42.090 --> 30:43.800
because you're gonna be the star witness.

30:44.592 --> 30:46.302
In fact, you'd have a much easier time
keeping it a secret

30:46.386 --> 30:47.762
if you came in and told us now.

30:50.765 --> 30:53.017
-What's going on?
-Uh, he's a policeman, honey.

30:53.101 --> 30:54.894
He-- He thinks I saw an accident.

30:55.937 --> 30:56.771
Did you?

30:57.146 --> 30:58.982
No, honey. I was home all day.

31:00.900 --> 31:01.985
She didn't see no accident.

31:02.569 --> 31:04.529
That's the end of it.
Come in the house, Coretta.

31:04.612 --> 31:08.616
That'll be all, Miss Dunford.
I want you to have a nice day.

31:10.201 --> 31:11.452
MAN: Come on, will ya?

31:12.829 --> 31:16.082
What are you doing in my spot?
Who told you to be there?

31:16.332 --> 31:20.461
You can't be there.
You can't have my space, get up.

31:21.462 --> 31:25.842
Get up, or I'll put this toe
up and down your head, cousin.

31:25.925 --> 31:29.137
What's goin' on?
What are you doing to this guy?

31:30.346 --> 31:34.225
This bum's sittin' in my place.
And he's wearing my coat!

31:34.309 --> 31:35.560
What's the matter with you?

31:35.977 --> 31:38.313
Can't you see the man is asleep?
Give him a break.

31:39.939 --> 31:41.983
This is where I sit, cousin.

31:43.776 --> 31:46.988
That's my coat, and that's my spot.

31:47.655 --> 31:52.160
I been sitting in that spot since 1867.

31:52.243 --> 31:54.704
I said he could borrow it.
Now leave him alone.

31:58.207 --> 31:59.292
Where's his shoes?

32:01.753 --> 32:03.129
-Who took his pants?
-(huffs)

32:05.298 --> 32:06.591
(coughing)

32:09.761 --> 32:11.846
(chattering)

32:16.225 --> 32:17.644
(coughing)

32:32.283 --> 32:33.117
Hold it.

32:35.244 --> 32:36.079
Is that you, Mick?

32:36.162 --> 32:37.872
(chattering on police radio)

32:37.956 --> 32:39.624
No, it's Barry Manilow.

32:43.920 --> 32:46.005
(sighs) You can come on in.

32:46.589 --> 32:49.050
Obradovich and Lester picked up
the Slasher down in the Heights.

32:49.133 --> 32:52.470
(growling) I wanted a piece
of that sleaze myself.

32:53.554 --> 32:56.265
-This guy looks really sick, Mick.
-What, him?

32:56.349 --> 33:00.561
(laughs) Compared to most of the guys down
here, he's back from Miami with a tan.

33:05.692 --> 33:06.526
BATES: Joe?

33:07.443 --> 33:08.361
We got a stiff here.

33:18.246 --> 33:20.581
It's not a stiff. It's Renko's dad.

33:31.801 --> 33:32.885
You won't have to say nothing.

33:32.969 --> 33:34.762
-(muttering)
-Well, if it was my--

33:35.513 --> 33:38.057
-Anything yet?
-We found your dad.

33:38.641 --> 33:40.643
COFFEY:
Well, we didn't exactly find him, per se.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.770
No, n-not per se.

33:42.854 --> 33:45.940
Uh, Andy, apparently the guys in the van

33:46.024 --> 33:49.610
just dropped him right back
at the mortuary before we spotted 'em.

33:50.361 --> 33:52.697
Yeah, it's real nice.
They have him in the Versailles Room.

33:52.780 --> 33:54.365
They didn't charge anything extra.

33:54.907 --> 33:57.452
You guys, you don't know
how much I appreciate this.

33:57.994 --> 34:00.788
I guess you don't know who your friends
are until something like this happens.

34:01.080 --> 34:01.914
God bless you.

34:07.420 --> 34:11.132
-Oh, I hate lying to the guy.
-We're not exactly lying.

34:11.549 --> 34:12.383
Lying about what?

34:12.467 --> 34:15.720
Those dirt bags left his old man to rot
right in the middle of Waverly Alley.

34:15.803 --> 34:17.388
It was pure luck we found him.

34:17.638 --> 34:20.475
I mean, he could have been there for weeks
just decomposing.

34:21.059 --> 34:26.147
Oh! That's a heartbreaking example
of modern urban angst.

34:27.774 --> 34:29.150
Henry, there's a woman to see you.

34:35.573 --> 34:36.407
Ma'am.

34:40.203 --> 34:41.871
Well, uh, I've been thinking.

34:44.499 --> 34:47.668
I don't-- I don't really want to wreck
that guy's life or anything.

34:49.629 --> 34:50.463
He was with me.

34:52.632 --> 34:54.717
Thank you.
Could you wait here? Be right back.

34:56.761 --> 34:58.096
-Frank?
-Mm-hmm?

34:58.638 --> 35:01.349
I've got a woman who's prepared
to swear she was in bed with Donald Lilly

35:01.432 --> 35:03.559
at the time he allegedly raped
Maria Hernandez.

35:04.894 --> 35:07.396
Okay, send a car to bring Maria back here,

35:07.480 --> 35:09.899
and notify Gail Kennedy
and Joyce Davenport.

35:09.982 --> 35:11.234
They'll want in on it, too.

35:14.320 --> 35:15.863
-MAN: Lucy.
-HENRY: Come with me.

35:17.281 --> 35:20.326
-Lucy.
-Bill, I don't want to see you anymore.

35:20.409 --> 35:23.663
I refuse to believe that.
Have dinner with me this evening.

35:23.746 --> 35:25.414
-BATES: No.
-LUCY: Look, I know you're upset.

35:26.332 --> 35:27.583
Real perceptive.

35:27.667 --> 35:30.711
-Just give me a chance to explain.
-Forget it.

35:31.629 --> 35:32.463
Lucy.

35:33.381 --> 35:36.175
Leave me alone, please.

35:39.262 --> 35:41.264
You heard the lady, pal,
so just let her be.

35:41.556 --> 35:44.308
I suggest you mind your own business,
Officer.

35:44.392 --> 35:47.103
Yeah, well, this is my business.
That lady is my partner.

35:47.186 --> 35:48.521
I know her and I care about her,

35:48.604 --> 35:50.356
so why don't you just butt out
of her life?

35:52.400 --> 35:53.234
What's your name?

35:53.317 --> 35:54.277
Joe Coffey.

35:55.278 --> 35:59.657
Yeah, my shield number is 77.
You want a pen and paper to write it down?

35:59.740 --> 36:02.410
No, thank you. I'll remember it.

36:07.206 --> 36:08.291
Do you believe some guys?

36:08.374 --> 36:11.502
Yeah, some guys.
But that wasn't just "some guy."

36:12.295 --> 36:13.880
I don't care who it was, Leo.

36:15.715 --> 36:16.549
Why, who was it?

36:16.632 --> 36:18.050
You don't want to know who it was.

36:19.093 --> 36:19.927
Who was it?

36:20.636 --> 36:23.055
William Lakeland,
Michigan Avenue Precinct.

36:23.306 --> 36:25.266
Commander William Lakeland.

36:26.392 --> 36:27.852
Well, you think that bothers me?

36:28.853 --> 36:29.687
It doesn't.

36:35.818 --> 36:37.028
NEAL: Got a minute, Captain?

36:37.778 --> 36:38.613
Sure, Neal.

36:40.990 --> 36:45.328
I've been bumping into walls lately,
working with Belker, then Goldblume.

36:45.745 --> 36:46.954
They're good men, Captain, but...

36:48.164 --> 36:48.998
what about J.D.?

36:49.540 --> 36:51.417
Uh-uh. He's a washout.

36:51.500 --> 36:52.919
I've gotta disagree, Captain.

37:04.764 --> 37:06.849
Let's not write any songs about him, Neal.

37:09.101 --> 37:11.520
At his best,
J.D. was a competent detective.

37:12.188 --> 37:13.397
At his worst, he's a drunk.

37:13.481 --> 37:14.857
I gave him a chance. He blew it.

37:15.191 --> 37:16.192
Is that all you get around here?

37:16.275 --> 37:18.611
One chance for a dozen years
of puttin' it on the line?

37:19.070 --> 37:20.947
My God, Captain, Art Delgado--

37:21.030 --> 37:22.949
He can't even button his own pants
anymore.

37:23.032 --> 37:25.534
And you gave him more consideration
than you're giving J.D.

37:25.618 --> 37:28.287
I may be a little out of line here,
and if I am, okay.

37:28.537 --> 37:32.792
But it seems to me you can't forgive J.D.
'cause he got the same problem you had.

37:33.084 --> 37:36.045
Still have, Neal. You never lose it.

37:36.337 --> 37:38.589
Then you oughta understand
better than most.

37:40.424 --> 37:41.634
I think I do.

37:43.177 --> 37:44.178
Look, Captain,

37:45.304 --> 37:48.224
there's not a cop up here on the Hill
who doesn't admire what you did.

37:48.808 --> 37:51.519
But you didn't do it alone.
No one ever does.

37:52.311 --> 37:55.690
And what you're telling J.D. is that
he can never make it back, no matter what.

38:05.533 --> 38:07.493
FRANK: Maria, we know you were raped,

38:07.576 --> 38:10.246
and we want to get the man who did it
just as much as you do.

38:10.329 --> 38:13.791
But we just spent a couple of hours
interrogating a young lady

38:14.208 --> 38:17.211
we now have good reason to believe
was with Donald Lilly

38:17.295 --> 38:18.754
at the time of your attack.

38:19.630 --> 38:20.589
It was him.

38:21.757 --> 38:23.426
I picked him out twice.

38:23.759 --> 38:25.136
Didn't the tests prove it was him?

38:25.219 --> 38:28.055
No, no, the tests can only show
if someone didn't do it.

38:28.389 --> 38:32.184
Maria, please,
if there's any chance at all

38:32.268 --> 38:35.479
that this is not the man who raped you,
we have to know.

38:35.563 --> 38:37.815
He was. I swear.

38:39.150 --> 38:42.111
Can you remember anything
about your attacker, anything at all

38:42.194 --> 38:44.780
that doesn't match up
with your identification of Donald Lilly?

38:45.364 --> 38:48.951
There was no one else out there.
It had to be him.

38:49.493 --> 38:51.620
Maria, please try to remember.

38:52.538 --> 38:54.290
If Donald Lilly didn't do it,

38:54.665 --> 38:56.917
then the man who did
is still on the streets.

38:58.336 --> 38:59.378
(crying) I don't know.

39:04.759 --> 39:05.718
Don't know what?

39:05.801 --> 39:07.303
(Maria sniffling)

39:08.054 --> 39:10.389
Maybe-- I don't know.

39:10.473 --> 39:12.683
Like, it could have been a gold chain
or something.

39:12.767 --> 39:13.809
Like, the guy--

39:15.811 --> 39:16.645
the guy--

39:17.146 --> 39:18.189
I don't know.

39:19.023 --> 39:22.401
There was a gold chain.
He probably threw it out.

39:23.402 --> 39:26.197
It was night. Don't you understand?

39:26.739 --> 39:27.865
GAIL: Around his neck?

39:28.240 --> 39:30.117
He wore a gold chain around his neck?

39:30.493 --> 39:31.327
Yes.

39:31.744 --> 39:34.538
Did you tear it off
of him during the attack?

39:38.167 --> 39:41.587
Maria, you're not really sure who it was
who attacked you, are you?

39:46.092 --> 39:46.926
No.

39:49.011 --> 39:50.346
I thought it was him.

39:55.559 --> 39:56.977
(whispers) I don't know anymore.

40:00.481 --> 40:02.358
There was no one else out on the street.

40:04.944 --> 40:08.989
So I thought, "Who else could it be?"

40:15.579 --> 40:17.832
-It's all right.
-Come on, Maria.

40:20.084 --> 40:21.752
Let's get you some coffee, huh?

40:21.836 --> 40:23.003
(chair scrapes floor)

40:25.256 --> 40:26.590
(door opens)

40:26.674 --> 40:28.843
-(phones ringing)
-(chattering)

40:28.926 --> 40:29.760
(door closes)

40:30.219 --> 40:32.972
So much for
<i>The People versus Donald Lilly.</i>

40:33.472 --> 40:34.890
JOYCE: You're dropping the charges?

40:35.683 --> 40:38.018
We picked up a suspect on a rape charge

40:38.102 --> 40:40.771
with a similar description
around four o'clock this afternoon.

40:40.855 --> 40:44.191
The victim mentioned her assailant
was wearing a gold chain.

40:44.733 --> 40:47.903
I think I'll bring the Hernandez girl
downtown for a lineup.

40:49.196 --> 40:51.449
I want Donald Lilly released tonight.

40:52.491 --> 40:54.702
I'll see to it as soon as I get back
to my office.

40:55.578 --> 40:56.412
Captain.

41:06.964 --> 41:10.468
Well, it seems as if there's
some small satisfaction

41:10.551 --> 41:12.178
in your work after all, counselor.

41:12.928 --> 41:15.681
Hmm. Donald and Maria.

41:16.015 --> 41:18.684
-Victims everywhere you look. No.
-Hmm?

41:20.227 --> 41:21.061
Yeah.

41:22.021 --> 41:22.855
It is nice.

41:30.488 --> 41:31.489
Renko?

41:32.948 --> 41:35.367
-My condolences.
-Thank you, sir.

41:35.451 --> 41:37.703
You know, Renko,
your father's death is really a metaphor

41:37.786 --> 41:40.539
for the absurdity of life
in this megalopolis.

41:41.290 --> 41:44.001
A man lives, a man dies,

41:44.793 --> 41:49.757
only to have his body stolen and discarded
in some alley like so much offal.

41:51.467 --> 41:53.177
-Oh, it-it's nothing, Renko. Forget it.
-Wh--

41:53.260 --> 41:54.512
HUNTER: Exactly so!

41:54.887 --> 41:57.806
The fact that they discarded his shell
in Waverly Alley

41:57.890 --> 41:59.433
speaks not to the deceased,

41:59.808 --> 42:03.938
but to the genetic bankruptcy of those
mutant, third-world body snatchers.

42:05.397 --> 42:07.608
They left him in an alley?

42:15.533 --> 42:17.743
(shouting) They left him in an alley!

42:18.744 --> 42:19.787
Way to go, Lieutenant.

42:35.427 --> 42:38.264
You bunch of jerks. Lying to me.
Making a fool out of me.

42:38.347 --> 42:41.141
We only lied to you, cowboy,
because we didn't want to hurt you.

42:41.225 --> 42:44.103
How could they do that to him?
Toss him in some alley

42:44.186 --> 42:46.730
with a bunch of dog-eatin' winos
like that?

42:46.814 --> 42:49.024
What's the difference?
That's not your old man.

42:49.650 --> 42:50.776
He's somewhere else now.

42:55.739 --> 42:57.950
When I was a little boy,
there was this other little boy named--

42:58.033 --> 43:00.411
named Jimmy Peterson,
or something like that,

43:00.494 --> 43:03.122
and his old man got drunk and hit me.

43:04.623 --> 43:08.168
My daddy called him out in the street
and beat the hell out of him.

43:10.421 --> 43:13.507
Then he took me home and beat me up, too.

43:15.884 --> 43:19.305
I hated him. He was cruel to my mama.

43:20.723 --> 43:22.391
He never did give me a break.

43:23.142 --> 43:25.477
Made all the little kids
feel like they were nothin'.

43:27.521 --> 43:29.982
He used to beat the tar out of me
when I was bad,

43:30.065 --> 43:31.984
and he never did hug me when I was good.

43:32.818 --> 43:34.820
(sighs)

43:34.903 --> 43:37.156
(sighs)

43:37.239 --> 43:39.533
He was your daddy, cowboy.

43:40.409 --> 43:42.161
You never had a choice.

43:49.752 --> 43:52.338
(chuckling)

43:59.720 --> 44:03.098
Now, what is so funny about this?

44:03.182 --> 44:05.726
The whole thing! (laughing)

44:05.809 --> 44:08.646
I'm sorry, cowboy, but it's just so funny.

44:08.729 --> 44:13.942
Your old man sitting in that alley
in his hospital greens, with no shoes,

44:14.026 --> 44:16.945
and dog breath Belker... (laughing)

44:17.029 --> 44:19.907
-(laughing)
-Offering him a bite of his sandwich!

44:22.660 --> 44:27.289
If-- if he wasn't dead already,
Belker's breath would've killed him!

44:31.460 --> 44:32.294
You know what?

44:32.628 --> 44:36.632
That's the first decent laugh
that damn old man ever gave me!

44:44.848 --> 44:45.724
Thanks.

44:49.436 --> 44:51.689
Neal, J.D.

44:53.315 --> 44:56.026
There's a large-scale fencing operation
out of a warehouse on Van Buren.

44:56.110 --> 44:58.570
If you're interested in the assignment,
Ray'll give you the particulars.

44:58.654 --> 45:00.280
Frank, we've got to pick up
our luggage first.

45:00.364 --> 45:01.657
All right. Where are Bates and--

45:01.740 --> 45:02.950
JOYCE: They're right here.

45:07.705 --> 45:11.041
You want romance, Henry?
Go to the Caribbean.

45:11.417 --> 45:13.210
-Mm!
-Right.

45:16.046 --> 45:18.424
(rock music playing)

45:18.507 --> 45:20.843
(chattering)

45:32.604 --> 45:33.897
WOMAN: Let me just have a brew.

45:42.698 --> 45:44.992
(indistinct chattering)

45:50.330 --> 45:51.165
Henry.

45:52.124 --> 45:52.958
Fay.

45:53.459 --> 45:55.753
What are you doing here?
Don't answer that.

45:55.836 --> 45:57.755
That's a stupid question. I'm sorry.

45:57.838 --> 46:01.175
Um, I want you to meet a friend of mine.
Vivian Wasserman, Henry Goldblume.

46:02.092 --> 46:04.595
Some swine took the last
of the cracked crab.

46:04.678 --> 46:06.013
And this is, um--

46:06.096 --> 46:06.930
-(mouths words)
-Oh, boy.

46:07.014 --> 46:09.057
Got guacamole all over my fingers.
Excuse me.

46:09.349 --> 46:13.729
Hi, guy. Marshall Paxton, past president
of Divorced Dentists of America.

46:13.812 --> 46:16.774
(snickers) Hey, that's a joke, pal.

46:16.857 --> 46:18.275
(chuckles) That's a joke.

46:19.568 --> 46:20.861
Why don't you and I go sit over there

46:20.944 --> 46:23.697
and let Fay and Henry
have a little privacy, okay?

46:23.781 --> 46:25.449
So you're a dentist? I adore dentists.

46:25.532 --> 46:27.034
You're not gonna make me open wide,
are you?

46:27.117 --> 46:29.703
PAXTON (chuckling): Whoa! Later.

46:32.247 --> 46:33.123
(sighs)

46:37.294 --> 46:38.128
(sighs)

46:42.633 --> 46:43.717
Ahh--

46:45.260 --> 46:47.554
Well, do you come
to these places often? (laughs)

46:47.638 --> 46:50.849
(laughs) Who, me? Nah.

46:50.933 --> 46:54.520
I-- You know, I just come with Vivian.
She needs the moral support.

46:55.729 --> 46:59.066
I can understand that.
This is a very depressing place.

46:59.149 --> 46:59.983
Hmm.

47:01.735 --> 47:02.945
Yeah, it sure is.

47:06.406 --> 47:07.449
Do you want some?

47:08.325 --> 47:09.993
No, thank you.

47:13.372 --> 47:16.667
I was, uh-- I was sorry to hear
about you and Rachel.

47:18.418 --> 47:19.378
Sorry, I missed that.

47:20.712 --> 47:23.423
I said, I was very sorry
to hear about you and Rachel.

47:25.717 --> 47:28.303
What can I say?
It happens in the best of families.

47:28.720 --> 47:29.847
Yeah. Don't I know.

47:30.931 --> 47:32.641
Uh, do you think you'll get back together?

47:33.642 --> 47:35.561
I doubt it. We separated once before.

47:36.103 --> 47:37.646
Oh, really? I didn't know that.

47:38.981 --> 47:40.190
How's Josh handling it?

47:41.525 --> 47:42.818
You know, adjusting.

47:48.699 --> 47:49.575
(sighs)

47:51.952 --> 47:52.995
-Fay.
-Mm-hmm?

47:55.539 --> 47:56.790
How long have you been divorced?

47:57.165 --> 47:58.584
Two years and three months.

47:59.251 --> 48:00.335
But who's counting?

48:03.714 --> 48:04.548
Henry...

48:06.425 --> 48:09.803
I hope you don't think that I'm being,
you know, pushy or anything,

48:09.887 --> 48:10.762
but, um--

48:12.514 --> 48:15.809
Well, face it.
You don't belong here any more than I do.

48:18.353 --> 48:20.898
Do you wanna go get a hamburger
and a cup of coffee?

48:22.733 --> 48:24.109
I think that'd be nice.

48:25.611 --> 48:26.612
Come on.

48:45.756 --> 48:48.759
(closing theme playing)
