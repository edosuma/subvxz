WEBVTT

02:20.988 --> 02:23.784
You know, I thought to maybe drive up to the town.

02:24.657 --> 02:26.308
You want something?

02:26.412 --> 02:27.009
No.

02:58.526 --> 02:59.188
Hunter?

03:01.174 --> 03:03.881
Who knew they would travel in pairs, I think.

03:06.954 --> 03:07.515
Come!

03:09.788 --> 03:10.997
Come on!

03:11.802 --> 03:12.966
What's going on?

03:18.539 --> 03:19.517
You have a gun?

03:20.421 --> 03:22.521
Why would you have a gun?

03:31.734 --> 03:32.047
Jack!

03:33.151 --> 03:34.507
Jack.

03:46.712 --> 03:47.657
Jack.

03:56.102 --> 03:57.467
Is he dead?

04:01.193 --> 04:07.137
- Jack.
- Go to the house and call the police.

04:07.348 --> 04:08.347
Go!

06:52.362 --> 06:54.135
- Yeah?
- It's Jack.

06:54.240 --> 06:55.388
I'm here.

06:56.108 --> 06:58.925
- What do you mean 'here'?
- Rome.

07:02.902 --> 07:05.197
There is a bar near the main station.

07:05.406 --> 07:09.160
Cafe di Ghetto. Wait there.

08:04.235 --> 08:06.425
- Jack.
- Pavel.

08:07.740 --> 08:09.097
It's been a while.

08:13.332 --> 08:14.375
Who was the girl?

08:14.792 --> 08:19.381
- A friend.
- A friend?

08:21.050 --> 08:22.198
Those were Swedes.

08:24.389 --> 08:26.996
I'm working on that.
It's gonna take some time.

08:28.873 --> 08:30.543
Did she set you up?

08:31.482 --> 08:33.256
She had nothing to do with it.

08:35.863 --> 08:37.530
Pity.

08:40.139 --> 08:41.600
You can't stay here.

08:41.705 --> 08:45.042
I made arrangements for you to leave
town while I sort this out.

08:50.675 --> 08:53.909
Take a right outside the bar. Then second left.

08:54.744 --> 08:59.855
Near Magenta you'll find dark blue
Fiat Tempra with Pescara plates.

09:02.150 --> 09:06.008
I've marked small town on the map.
Castelvecchio.

09:07.574 --> 09:09.452
Stay there. Lay low till you get my call.

09:11.956 --> 09:13.833
Don't talk to anyone.

09:16.441 --> 09:18.006
And above all,

09:18.423 --> 09:20.196
Don't make any friends, Jack.

09:21.761 --> 09:23.325
You used to know that.

15:06.412 --> 15:07.768
'Giorno!

15:09.437 --> 15:10.480
Hello

15:12.986 --> 15:15.280
- Where are you from?
- I?

15:15.696 --> 15:16.635
Ah, you're an American.

15:16.947 --> 15:20.808
- Yes, "A American."
- Not "A American", but "an American."

15:20.912 --> 15:21.956
L'americano.

16:03.472 --> 16:05.767
- Can I help you?
- I'm not good with machines

16:06.184 --> 16:07.644
- Are you an American?
- Yes.

16:08.897 --> 16:11.400
- Speak Italian?
- A little.

16:12.131 --> 16:15.050
- On vacation?
- A working vacation.

16:16.198 --> 16:18.805
Do you work?
What kind of job do you have?

16:20.580 --> 16:21.937
I am a photographer.

16:22.145 --> 16:23.918
- Take pictures
- Yes.

16:24.231 --> 16:29.550
- What kind of photos?
- Pictures of architecture, landscape.

16:29.760 --> 16:31.324
- People?
- No people.

16:31.742 --> 16:34.558
Just publication for magazines.

16:34.871 --> 16:37.791
Magazines? Which magazines?

16:38.104 --> 16:42.173
- Different ones. Casa Editrice
- Okay.

16:42.591 --> 16:44.781
You must share a glass
of wine with me.

16:44.885 --> 16:46.762
- Come tonight.
- I can't, no.

16:47.387 --> 16:49.578
You want to know the truth
about Abruzzo?

16:50.308 --> 16:52.499
The priest sees everything.

17:51.020 --> 17:53.731
- Yeah?
- It's Jack.

17:55.191 --> 17:57.069
You don't answer the cell I gave you.

17:58.114 --> 17:59.781
I'm not good with machines.

18:01.242 --> 18:03.225
You don't make this
easy for me, Jack.

18:04.684 --> 18:06.144
Gotta job for you.

18:06.771 --> 18:10.630
It's a custom fit. You don't
even have to pull the trigger.

18:12.717 --> 18:13.656
I'll think about it.

18:29.093 --> 18:31.701
The quality of the brandy is good.

18:33.685 --> 18:34.936
Smooth.

18:36.395 --> 18:39.003
The only good thing to
come from the French.

18:51.834 --> 18:56.319
- You study our history?
- No.

18:59.554 --> 19:05.603
You come to Italy to make a guidebook
and you don't care about history?

19:07.899 --> 19:11.550
- I take pictures.
- Of course.

19:13.949 --> 19:15.199
You're American.

19:17.808 --> 19:23.442
You think you can escape history.
You live for the present.

19:24.902 --> 19:26.465
I try to, Father.

20:52.420 --> 20:53.673
Hello

20:53.777 --> 20:58.262
- I would like this cheese...
- A wheel of Pecorino?

20:58.576 --> 21:00.974
Okay, immediately. 12 Euros.

21:09.736 --> 21:11.614
- Here.
- Thank you.

21:16.412 --> 21:17.873
Here is the change.

21:19.438 --> 21:22.255
- Thanks.
- And I thank you.

21:34.772 --> 21:38.109
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

21:42.910 --> 21:45.203
- Your coffee.
- Thank you.

21:46.559 --> 21:50.419
- What you want, sir?
- Bring me an americano.

21:50.523 --> 21:51.567
In a minute.

21:55.217 --> 21:58.137
- I am Edward.
- Mathilda.

22:08.048 --> 22:11.594
- Range?
- 150 to 175 meters.

22:12.638 --> 22:16.705
- Time?
- 5 seconds. 7 at the most.

22:17.644 --> 22:19.940
- Target?
- One.

22:20.878 --> 22:22.966
- Firing rate?
- Rapid.

22:24.633 --> 22:28.701
- Magazine capacity?
- Large, Preferably a 556.

22:29.223 --> 22:31.831
The weapon must be
fairly light and compact.

22:31.937 --> 22:32.978
How compact?

22:33.188 --> 22:34.439
As compact as possible.

22:36.316 --> 22:38.819
What, an automatic weapon to
fit inside of a woman's purse?

22:39.238 --> 22:41.323
A small vanity case
would be permissible.

22:42.263 --> 22:43.931
Small briefcase
should be possible.

22:45.391 --> 22:47.791
- Noise?
- Silencer.

22:48.417 --> 22:50.191
I can only give you a supressor.

22:50.713 --> 22:54.259
It will dampen the decibels
and dislocate the sound source.

22:55.718 --> 22:57.074
Reduce the muzzle flash.

22:57.700 --> 23:01.039
I can't make you silent but I can make you
invisible as long as you're willing to lose the range.

23:01.979 --> 23:03.230
2 o'clock.

23:05.942 --> 23:08.445
Light blue shirt. Sunglasses.
Is he with you?

23:12.096 --> 23:13.453
I didn't see him.

23:13.870 --> 23:15.642
In any case I'm alone.

23:18.459 --> 23:20.963
- Your Coffee, American.
- Thank you.

23:25.969 --> 23:27.743
I can accept a slight loss of range.

23:30.143 --> 23:34.523
You want a weapon with a firing capacity of a
sub-machine gun with the range of a rifle.

23:36.714 --> 23:37.861
Can you do it?

25:50.757 --> 25:56.285
- Clark. A package.
- Clark. Of course.

28:50.385 --> 28:51.636
I'm Clara.

29:08.014 --> 29:10.413
Thanks. See you tonight.

29:56.624 --> 29:59.335
All the sheep in my flock are dear to me.

29:59.441 --> 30:01.422
But some are dearer than the most.

30:02.674 --> 30:05.281
Especially those that have lost the way.

30:06.324 --> 30:10.184
Fabio, mechanic.
Car doctor.

30:11.332 --> 30:15.399
But I think his work
is not always legal.

30:35.323 --> 30:37.306
Did you ever want to be
anything but a priest?

30:40.018 --> 30:44.191
Have you ever wanted to be anything
other than a... photographer?

30:44.920 --> 30:50.657
- I do what I'm good at.
- You have the hands of a craftsman.

30:51.598 --> 30:54.831
Not an artist. You are good with machines.

30:56.707 --> 31:00.255
Yet you told me just the opposite
when we first met. Eh?

31:06.305 --> 31:10.061
Journalism can not
make you a rich man.

31:13.504 --> 31:15.276
Perhaps you are rich already.

31:20.283 --> 31:26.019
A man can be rich if he
has God in his heart.

31:30.088 --> 31:31.966
I don't think God is very
interested in me, Father.

32:51.766 --> 32:54.895
Fabio.
Got some damage to my car.

32:56.564 --> 33:00.110
- Sorry, I'm busy.
- I am the friend of father Benedetto.

33:01.886 --> 33:03.763
- The American?
- Yes.

33:04.701 --> 33:06.683
I'm taking photographs to the mountains.

33:10.543 --> 33:12.003
Okay, okay.

33:21.704 --> 33:25.980
You need beautiful model for your photos.
Pretty Italian girl.

33:27.024 --> 33:29.423
No, I need tools for a broken drive shaft.

33:35.265 --> 33:38.707
- Are you a mechanic?
- It's a hobby.

33:42.046 --> 33:45.800
My garage... your garage.

33:47.992 --> 33:51.955
- However, you want to check a bit?
- Yes, thanks.

35:07.270 --> 35:10.085
- How much?
- Nothing.

35:12.381 --> 35:13.424
Thank you.

37:59.595 --> 38:02.411
- Where's Clara?
- Not working tonight.

38:03.665 --> 38:07.106
- Want to drink anything?
- No, thanks.

38:07.210 --> 38:08.670
Thanks.

38:59.055 --> 39:00.619
Got a letter from a friend.

39:15.953 --> 39:20.543
Three dead in Dalarna

42:08.069 --> 42:09.739
Hello again.

43:04.816 --> 43:06.380
Is this place getting many visitors?

43:08.154 --> 43:09.614
This is only way to get here.

43:11.806 --> 43:14.204
Did you check it for footprints
and tire tracks?

43:14.622 --> 43:17.645
Three days ago I walked
the river. Both sides.

43:18.795 --> 43:20.254
Let's check again.

44:29.519 --> 44:32.231
- Rounds?
- I prepared two kinds.

44:32.440 --> 44:37.758
- 10 jacket and 10 expand.
- I'd like 20 of each.

44:38.907 --> 44:41.515
- And then 10 explosive.
- Not a problem.

44:41.828 --> 44:45.165
- Will mercury do?
- Mercury will do very nicely.

44:48.296 --> 44:49.652
I brought my own target.

44:58.831 --> 45:00.291
There.

45:45.668 --> 45:49.423
- Muzzle velocity?
- About 360 miles an hour.

45:49.631 --> 45:52.865
That's including 20 miles an hour off
for the sound suppression.

45:54.327 --> 45:56.517
- What model?
- M14.

45:57.768 --> 45:58.915
I've never had one before.

46:00.272 --> 46:01.733
You'll find it easy.

46:04.758 --> 46:08.825
I've rebalanced it by the way due to suppressor.
The fulcrum is 2 cm forward from the grip

46:08.930 --> 46:12.685
But that should not matter as I suppose
you'd fire it from a fixed position.

46:13.728 --> 46:14.875
There's no major recoil issues.

46:15.084 --> 46:17.588
You should be able to hold any
target, even the smallest.

46:50.447 --> 46:54.202
Go to the flower.
Fire into these reeds.

46:55.453 --> 46:57.122
Say two steps away for me.

46:58.896 --> 47:00.878
Two bursts.
Five seconds apart.

47:57.729 --> 48:02.109
The sound suppression is superb.
I could not place the direction of fire.

48:08.159 --> 48:10.976
I shall require the rounds and
the weapon by the first of next month.

48:11.080 --> 48:14.732
In the meantime, could you try adjusting
screws on the sight? It's too loose.

48:15.044 --> 48:16.296
What about the case?

48:16.818 --> 48:21.304
It's a Samsonite briefcase, black.
Combination locks it. Do you have a number you prefer?

48:22.033 --> 48:24.120
- 014.
- 014.

48:27.979 --> 48:30.171
What should I do with these?

48:39.871 --> 48:40.915
How thoughtful!

48:43.627 --> 48:45.607
Asprinio. Don't know it.

48:45.713 --> 48:47.694
It's Muscatto, only frizzante.

48:48.425 --> 48:50.719
Wouldn't look good if.
the picnic wasn't touched.

48:52.285 --> 48:54.476
- You chilled the wine.
- Had to be chilled.

48:54.512 --> 48:55.622
Italian cops.

49:02.508 --> 49:03.864
Do not move.

49:11.791 --> 49:13.251
So beautiful!

49:14.816 --> 49:16.172
It's endangered.

49:22.222 --> 49:25.142
- You like coming here.
- Serves the purpose.

49:26.605 --> 49:27.959
You've never taken a woman here before?

49:29.107 --> 49:30.046
No.

49:37.140 --> 49:38.391
Perhaps you do not have a woman
in your life.

50:06.451 --> 50:09.059
Thank you for a lovely
day, Mr Butterfly.

50:52.242 --> 50:54.848
Sergio Leone. Italian.

51:15.295 --> 51:17.173
No.

52:37.078 --> 52:39.060
Slowly. God.

53:59.262 --> 54:01.662
Everything is strange.

54:10.507 --> 54:12.302
Weird?

54:14.498 --> 54:15.849
Yes.

54:16.996 --> 54:17.727
It is as if...

54:18.352 --> 54:22.629
As if you can't stop thinking about something.

54:27.469 --> 54:29.305
Or someone.

54:43.595 --> 54:44.951
Mr. Farfalla...

54:54.341 --> 54:56.010
You don't have to act.

54:57.469 --> 54:58.721
Act?

55:00.401 --> 55:03.312
You might have to with other clients but
you don't have to with me.

55:04.459 --> 55:06.441
I want you to be exactly
who you are.

55:07.067 --> 55:09.884
I came here to get pleasure,
not to give it.

55:22.402 --> 55:24.279
Maybe I pretend very well...

55:33.668 --> 55:36.275
You give me my tips that the other girls get.

55:39.927 --> 55:41.699
I do not sleep with other girls.

57:38.321 --> 57:39.679
Hey, Mr. Farfalla.

57:40.407 --> 57:41.972
- How are you?
- Okay, thanks.

57:42.285 --> 57:43.850
This is my girlfriend, Anna.

57:44.163 --> 57:44.997
Hi.

57:45.622 --> 57:46.875
Nice to meet you, Anna.

57:47.605 --> 57:49.587
You want to join me for some coffee?

57:50.630 --> 57:52.465
No, go see an American movie.

57:52.715 --> 57:54.072
Anna is learning English.

57:54.698 --> 57:56.887
I would love to go to America.

57:58.974 --> 58:04.501
But perhaps we can see each other soon.
On Wednesday I'm free.

58:05.232 --> 58:06.587
OK, I'll be there.

58:07.840 --> 58:08.675
Where?

58:10.761 --> 58:12.117
The usual place.

58:14.515 --> 58:19.102
The usual place. I forgot.
Where is our usual place?

58:28.489 --> 58:29.846
Let's go someplace new.

58:31.827 --> 58:33.392
You can decide.

58:36.729 --> 58:39.024
- Locanda Grappalli?
- Great.

58:39.337 --> 58:41.215
Locanda Grappalli... good food.

58:41.737 --> 58:43.615
- Grappali?
- See you there?

58:44.346 --> 58:46.534
- See you there.
- At 8.

58:46.847 --> 58:47.681
At 8.

58:49.768 --> 58:51.645
Goodbye, Mr. Farfalla.

58:52.376 --> 58:54.253
Anna, I was nice to meet you.

59:18.346 --> 59:21.581
Two more murdered prostitutes.

01:03:08.649 --> 01:03:09.693
Yes.

01:03:09.901 --> 01:03:11.048
The Swedes found me.

01:03:11.362 --> 01:03:12.613
Stay put.

01:03:13.656 --> 01:03:15.325
Finish the job.

01:03:15.742 --> 01:03:16.994
How the fuck did they know I was here?

01:03:18.558 --> 01:03:20.749
Cause you've lost your edge, Jack.

01:04:07.499 --> 01:04:09.794
Some are greater sinners than others.

01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:46.382
Good morning. You're up early!

01:04:46.695 --> 01:04:47.947
I needed some air.

01:04:50.241 --> 01:04:52.119
I walk here to meditate.

01:04:52.642 --> 01:04:55.665
I thank God for certain favors

01:04:56.396 --> 01:04:57.438
he has granted me.

01:04:58.795 --> 01:05:02.132
And ask him to look after
to those of my friends

01:05:02.446 --> 01:05:03.488
who are sinners

01:05:07.868 --> 01:05:09.016
All men are sinners.

01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:17.569
But those who seek peace
are much sinning in the history.

01:05:18.195 --> 01:05:19.342
Maybe.

01:05:20.177 --> 01:05:23.202
Forgive me, this is the priest
in me speaking...

01:05:24.245 --> 01:05:28.625
but you have done much
sinning, Mr. Clark.

01:05:30.607 --> 01:05:33.737
Are you still do.

01:05:37.177 --> 01:05:39.369
Something happened
here last night.

01:05:41.454 --> 01:05:43.437
Everything I've done I
had good cause to do.

01:05:44.272 --> 01:05:45.731
Do you wish to tell me?

01:05:45.835 --> 01:05:47.295
- To confess?
- Yes.

01:05:48.339 --> 01:05:49.695
For what reason?

01:05:49.903 --> 01:05:51.468
For your sake.

01:05:52.094 --> 01:05:54.701
- Perhaps I can pray for you.
- perhaps.

01:05:57.204 --> 01:06:01.168
I wonder how many bastards
have been made here

01:06:04.403 --> 01:06:05.861
You work in metal...

01:06:06.904 --> 01:06:09.305
You were given some steel by Fabio...

01:06:10.138 --> 01:06:11.390
The car doctor.

01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:14.624
Where was he conceived, Father?

01:06:18.796 --> 01:06:20.151
Why do you ask me that?

01:06:21.924 --> 01:06:23.594
You have each others photos.

01:06:24.115 --> 01:06:25.262
You have each other's eyes.

01:06:27.244 --> 01:06:30.268
Was he conceived here under the trees
at night like all the other bastards?

01:06:34.129 --> 01:06:36.214
I do not remember, sir.

01:06:38.405 --> 01:06:40.178
It was many years ago.

01:06:44.767 --> 01:06:46.436
In the end, it is I
who confesses to you.

01:06:48.626 --> 01:06:50.295
You want me to do the same?

01:06:50.504 --> 01:06:51.652
For your own good.

01:06:52.590 --> 01:06:54.884
You can not doubt the
existence of hell.

01:06:55.615 --> 01:06:56.659
You live in it.

01:06:57.597 --> 01:06:59.474
It is a place without love.

01:07:01.248 --> 01:07:03.959
Perhaps I don't have the right
to wear these robes...

01:07:04.377 --> 01:07:05.941
But I have a heart...

01:07:06.983 --> 01:07:08.340
full of a father's love.

01:07:09.278 --> 01:07:12.721
Something close to his heart.

01:07:15.328 --> 01:07:17.935
And for that, I'm both
grateful and happy.

01:07:24.298 --> 01:07:25.759
What do you have?

01:07:27.949 --> 01:07:28.262
My friend?

01:08:13.634 --> 01:08:15.303
On time.

01:08:17.805 --> 01:08:20.309
I was not sure, you know,
you were coming.

01:08:21.353 --> 01:08:22.813
I was not sure you meant me to.

01:08:24.167 --> 01:08:24.377
Of course yes.

01:08:31.157 --> 01:08:33.452
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

01:08:41.170 --> 01:08:43.673
Can you bring us a bottle
of mineral water and a Montepulciano?

01:08:43.779 --> 01:08:45.759
English menu?

01:08:46.072 --> 01:08:47.078
No, thanks.

01:08:47.115 --> 01:08:48.575
German, Dutch?

01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:50.035
Gentleman speaks Italian
as good as me.

01:08:50.245 --> 01:08:54.207
I repeat: a bottle of mineral water
and a bottle of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo.

01:08:56.917 --> 01:08:59.108
- With gas?
- No

01:09:02.553 --> 01:09:04.638
People from the provinces...

01:09:20.702 --> 01:09:21.953
Can I ask you something?

01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:23.203
Sure.

01:09:27.792 --> 01:09:28.211
You're married?

01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:32.383
No.

01:09:36.450 --> 01:09:38.328
I was sure this was your secret.

01:09:39.162 --> 01:09:40.520
Why do I have to have a secret?

01:09:44.169 --> 01:09:47.924
You're a good man, but...
You are a secret.

01:09:54.078 --> 01:09:54.520
Excuse me.

01:09:54.913 --> 01:09:56.963
No. No, thanks.

01:09:56.998 --> 01:09:59.502
No. He thinks that
we are a couple.

01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:03.050
- It's all right.
- Thank you.

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:32.987
Hello.

01:14:33.926 --> 01:14:35.177
I need some more time.

01:14:37.055 --> 01:14:38.619
You're testing my patience.

01:14:39.975 --> 01:14:41.330
Just give me a few more days.

01:14:44.356 --> 01:14:45.920
You have two days.
Then you make a drop.

01:15:33.797 --> 01:15:35.881
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:15:45.164 --> 01:15:45.999
Where we go?

01:15:47.250 --> 01:15:48.397
Someplace beautiful.

01:15:49.233 --> 01:15:50.798
We go to a picnic?

01:15:55.176 --> 01:15:56.742
- Picnic.
- Yeah, a picnic.

01:15:58.515 --> 01:16:00.080
I have to practice my English.

01:16:01.228 --> 01:16:04.773
Today we're going to have a picnic.

01:16:04.878 --> 01:16:06.025
It is a beautiful day.

01:16:37.839 --> 01:16:41.698
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

01:16:51.293 --> 01:16:54.006
I think it is good we
stay close to the road.

01:16:54.943 --> 01:16:57.656
Don't worry, I've been down
this road many times taking photographs.

01:17:14.554 --> 01:17:17.682
- Only you come here?
- Yes.

01:17:33.433 --> 01:17:34.581
It is a paradise.

01:17:47.617 --> 01:17:50.120
I'm going to swim in the water.
You come?

01:17:50.537 --> 01:17:52.310
It is cold.

01:17:53.981 --> 01:17:54.918
Maybe.

01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:06.182
Come!

01:18:10.565 --> 01:18:11.920
Come, Mr. Farfalla.

01:18:13.798 --> 01:18:15.049
Is beautiful, no?

01:18:22.664 --> 01:18:24.438
We make love in water...

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:31.738
What is wrong?

01:18:32.989 --> 01:18:34.033
Should eat.

01:18:39.769 --> 01:18:41.752
Look. It's a bullet.

01:18:42.273 --> 01:18:43.837
Maybe there are hunters here.

01:18:44.046 --> 01:18:44.983
I don't think so.

01:19:18.257 --> 01:19:23.577
Edward... is it your real name?

01:19:47.150 --> 01:19:48.818
Can you put this behind?

01:19:53.929 --> 01:19:54.971
What?

01:20:06.654 --> 01:20:07.696
Nothing.

01:20:23.134 --> 01:20:25.220
- Grazie
- Just don't understand what the hell are you doing with a gun.

01:20:26.263 --> 01:20:27.724
A friend of mine gave it to me.

01:20:28.141 --> 01:20:28.975
The two prostitutes
were killed in Pescara, right?

01:20:30.957 --> 01:20:32.209
Did you see what they do to them?

01:20:33.147 --> 01:20:34.087
The police showed me the photographs.

01:20:34.607 --> 01:20:36.067
I wanted to feel safe
with clients.

01:20:36.103 --> 01:20:37.528
Does it make you feel safe with me?

01:20:37.945 --> 01:20:39.093
You're not a client.

01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:41.909
- Then why is it in your bag?
- Because I work tonight.

01:20:56.928 --> 01:20:58.285
It is a "procession".

01:20:59.849 --> 01:21:03.917
- A procession?
- Yes. Tomorrow

01:21:08.506 --> 01:21:09.757
Want to do this together?

01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:12.679
Maybe.

01:21:13.722 --> 01:21:14.556
Really?

01:21:17.059 --> 01:21:22.379
And after? After that,
tomorrow, the next day...

01:21:23.526 --> 01:21:25.298
I can not stay forever, Clara.

01:21:35.833 --> 01:21:37.920
- It's time to go.
- Take me home with you.

01:21:37.957 --> 01:21:40.214
I can't.

01:22:30.071 --> 01:22:31.115
Yeah?

01:22:32.576 --> 01:22:33.556
I'll make the delivery,
then I'm out.

01:22:39.459 --> 01:22:40.293
Pavel?

01:22:46.538 --> 01:22:47.582
Okay, Jack.

01:22:49.578 --> 01:22:50.620
You're out.

01:23:30.047 --> 01:23:31.611
Now you listen to me carefully...

01:26:25.067 --> 01:26:26.841
A coffee.

01:26:40.714 --> 01:26:42.174
I see you've brought it in with you.

01:26:43.008 --> 01:26:44.259
Everything is here, as we agreed.

01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:46.972
What is this?

01:26:55.003 --> 01:26:58.549
Thought you might
have a sweet tooth.

01:27:02.931 --> 01:27:04.911
That's very kind of you.

01:27:14.299 --> 01:27:16.385
I guess I'll be reading about it
in the "Tribune"?

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:23.686
Yes. I expect so.

01:27:43.818 --> 01:27:45.694
I'm just going to
the ladies. Wait here.

01:28:52.553 --> 01:28:54.743
- You okay?
- I'm fine. You?

01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:56.308
Just fine.

01:28:57.142 --> 01:28:58.082
You won't need a gun.

01:28:59.333 --> 01:29:00.481
You never know.

01:29:15.083 --> 01:29:16.334
Final payment.

01:29:49.816 --> 01:29:51.381
Goodbye, Mr. Butterfly.

01:30:45.932 --> 01:30:46.870
Hello?

01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:48.435
What happened?

01:30:49.478 --> 01:30:50.938
There wasn't any opportunity.

01:30:52.503 --> 01:30:53.546
Find one.

01:30:54.380 --> 01:30:55.527
I'm following it now.

01:32:49.636 --> 01:32:50.992
I was looking for you.

01:32:52.869 --> 01:32:54.016
I'm here.

01:32:55.268 --> 01:32:56.206
What are you doing tonight?

01:32:57.354 --> 01:32:58.397
I work tonight.

01:32:59.858 --> 01:33:01.005
Don't.

01:33:06.011 --> 01:33:07.784
If I ask you to come
away with me, would you?

01:33:09.349 --> 01:33:10.600
Come away with you?

01:33:12.583 --> 01:33:13.521
Why not?

01:33:19.780 --> 01:33:21.240
- Together?
- Together.

01:33:21.762 --> 01:33:24.056
- Forever?
- Forever.

01:33:38.241 --> 01:33:40.640
I want you to take this and
meet me at the river.

01:33:41.579 --> 01:33:43.457
- Eduardo?
- Go! Go!

01:34:09.423 --> 01:34:10.464
Who?

01:34:11.613 --> 01:34:13.178
For the same man...

01:34:17.245 --> 01:34:18.600
as you Jack.

01:34:19.017 --> 01:34:20.061
Yes

01:34:44.365 --> 01:34:45.512
I'm sorry, Father.

01:38:59.909 --> 01:39:00.847
Eduardo!

01:39:01.994 --> 01:39:03.245
Eduardo!

01:39:03.976 --> 01:39:05.332
Eduardo!
