(horn honks in distance)

00:03.150 --> 00:05.285
Ysidro Pineda. 33.

00:05.319 --> 00:06.820
Migrant worker from Honduras working

00:06.838 --> 00:09.823
in a chicken processing
plant in north bay.

00:09.857 --> 00:12.992
(murmuring)

00:13.010 --> 00:14.761
Both hands amputated

00:14.796 --> 00:16.663
5 centimeters proximal to the wrist

00:16.681 --> 00:18.331
by a factory blade.

00:18.349 --> 00:21.334
- Injury occurred at 6:47 this morning.
- Alex, look at me.

00:21.352 --> 00:22.602
He lost a lot of blood

00:22.637 --> 00:24.337
and was hypertensive when
the paramedics arrived.

00:24.372 --> 00:27.324
You saw me the other day and you
said my name. (speaking indistinctly)

00:27.358 --> 00:28.842
Every minute of ischemia
that his hands suffered...

00:28.876 --> 00:29.843
(speaking indistinctly) (sighs)

00:29.877 --> 00:31.344
Just turn your head and look at me.

00:31.362 --> 00:34.748
Functional outcome.
Clean cut. Hands put on ice.

00:34.782 --> 00:36.283
What's the timeline on this?

00:36.317 --> 00:39.653
We've got 12 hours to replant,
from the time of amputation.

00:39.687 --> 00:40.904
Or?

00:40.955 --> 00:42.387
Pump all the blood you
want back into the hands.

00:42.421 --> 00:43.156
It'll be too late.

00:43.190 --> 00:45.375
Exactly, so minus travel
time from North Bay,

00:45.410 --> 00:48.228
we have eight hours before
this man's hands die.

00:48.262 --> 00:50.447
Dr. Goran, can you outline our approach?

00:50.481 --> 00:51.865
(thuds)

00:51.883 --> 00:53.867
Yes, uh, two teams, one per hand,

00:53.885 --> 00:55.869
ortho, vascular, and plastics.

00:55.903 --> 00:57.370
Uh, Dr. Kinney will lead one team.

00:57.388 --> 01:00.724
I will lead another, but this is
Dr. Kinney's surgery.

01:00.758 --> 01:01.975
Does anyone know

01:02.009 --> 01:04.376
how many successful
double-hand replantations

01:04.412 --> 01:07.981
have been done in this
city in the past decade?

01:09.567 --> 01:12.018
Reid. (raised voice) Dr. Reid.

01:12.052 --> 01:13.019
(murmuring)

01:13.053 --> 01:15.021
(clears throat) What? Sorry. What?

01:15.055 --> 01:19.493
The answer is none, Dr. Reid.
Enjoying your nap?

01:19.527 --> 01:21.445
So Dr. Kinney and I will pick teams.

01:21.496 --> 01:23.079
How long till the patient gets here?

01:23.114 --> 01:24.531
Medevac's schedule to land at 11:00.

01:24.565 --> 01:26.500
Then he'll be brought
straight here by ambulance.

01:26.534 --> 01:28.585
If you're chosen for a team,
you'll get a page.

01:28.619 --> 01:32.372
This is big... for Hope-Zee, for all of us.

01:32.406 --> 01:33.757
The clock's ticking.

01:33.791 --> 01:36.843
(indistinct conversations)

01:36.878 --> 01:39.212
Don't worry. You weren't snoring.

01:39.246 --> 01:41.465
Thanks.

01:44.769 --> 01:47.387
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me.

01:49.223 --> 01:52.025
Dr. Kinney, I am so,
so sorry that I fell asleep.

01:52.059 --> 01:53.443
It won't happen again.

01:53.478 --> 01:57.230
Oh, no biggie. You know,
I fell asleep during a surgery once.

01:57.265 --> 01:58.949
Go home. Get some rest.

01:58.983 --> 02:01.067
Home.

02:01.101 --> 02:03.286
Right.

02:03.321 --> 02:04.905
Thank you.

02:07.992 --> 02:09.626
That poor guy. He comes up here

02:09.660 --> 02:11.461
to make money to send back to his family,

02:11.496 --> 02:12.963
and it costs him both his hands.

02:12.997 --> 02:14.414
That's rotten luck.

02:14.448 --> 02:15.799
(sighs) You're his only chance
at a normal life, Joel.

02:15.833 --> 02:17.968
Oh, me and about nine other men and women.

02:18.002 --> 02:19.803
(sighs)

02:19.837 --> 02:21.304
(file thuds)

02:21.339 --> 02:24.307
I would do anything to
get in on that surgery.

02:24.342 --> 02:28.311
Anything.

02:28.346 --> 02:30.480
I don't know.

02:30.515 --> 02:32.732
It kinda feels like you're using me here.

02:32.767 --> 02:35.435
Mm. Yeah. I am.

02:35.469 --> 02:36.987
For your body.

02:37.021 --> 02:38.522
Seriously, Joel.

02:38.573 --> 02:40.824
I'll do anything. I don't
care how menial the task is.

02:40.858 --> 02:42.576
I will tag the neurovascular structures.

02:42.610 --> 02:44.911
I will do the fasciotomies. Anything.

02:44.946 --> 02:47.113
Just help me out here, please?

02:49.033 --> 02:50.500
I'll see what I can do. (sighs)

02:50.535 --> 02:51.501
Really?

02:51.536 --> 02:52.586
Mm-hmm.

02:52.620 --> 02:54.287
You're the best.

02:58.709 --> 03:00.710
(pager buzzes)

03:01.996 --> 03:04.264
Gotta get back to Kinney.

The nursing home gets a flu outbreak,

and it becomes our problem.

03:31.358 --> 03:32.792
(Jackson) He's old. He can't breathe.

03:32.827 --> 03:35.211
And he's taking a bed away from
someone I can actually help.

03:35.246 --> 03:38.832
It's our only empty room. Sorry, Jackson.

03:38.866 --> 03:40.000
(Jackson) That's okay.

You should hear

03:41.719 --> 03:43.703
"Jackson, do this. Jackson, do that."

03:43.721 --> 03:45.238
The doctor's not wrong.

03:45.273 --> 03:46.506
Electricity bills alone,

03:46.540 --> 03:47.841
they should've pulled
the plug on me years ago,

03:47.875 --> 03:48.875
don't you think?

03:48.893 --> 03:50.010
That's you?

03:50.044 --> 03:53.379
Yeah. Scott Cockburn. How ya doin'?

03:53.397 --> 03:56.600
Charlie Harris. You're... In a coma.

03:56.651 --> 04:01.220

(sighs)

05:07.254 --> 05:08.254
Right hand is me.

05:08.288 --> 05:10.790
Simons on ortho. Reycraft on vascular.

05:10.808 --> 05:11.808
Strong team.

05:11.842 --> 05:13.710
Left hand, I put Carpenter on plastics,

05:13.744 --> 05:15.111
you on ortho, and for tying up,

05:15.146 --> 05:17.947
I was thinking Perino.

05:17.982 --> 05:19.149
Perino?

05:19.183 --> 05:20.734
Yeah.

05:20.768 --> 05:23.436
Yep. He's... okay.

05:23.470 --> 05:25.155
Okay, if not Perino, then who?

05:25.189 --> 05:27.407
- Alex.
- Can't. Gone home to rest.

05:27.441 --> 05:29.309
- You sent her home?
- She fell asleep during grand rounds.

05:29.343 --> 05:30.326
So bring her back in.

05:30.361 --> 05:31.978
Joel, I know she's very talented...

05:31.996 --> 05:34.480
She's more than that.
Alex is born to tie up veins.

05:34.498 --> 05:35.815
Her hands are rock solid.

05:35.833 --> 05:38.201
She's exhausted, and we both know it.

05:38.252 --> 05:40.954
I mean, Charlie and her job,
taking extra shifts in the E.R.

05:40.988 --> 05:43.373
Alex has done electives
in microvascular surgery

05:43.424 --> 05:45.425
at Emory, Cleveland Clinic, Sunnybrook.

05:45.459 --> 05:46.659
So has Reycraft.

05:46.677 --> 05:47.660
He's not chief surgical resident.

05:47.695 --> 05:49.579
Mm. Not yet.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.300
What does that mean?

05:54.334 --> 05:56.803
It means Perino's your guy.

05:59.356 --> 06:01.024
Okay.

06:02.910 --> 06:06.863
(indistinct conversations)

06:06.897 --> 06:10.483
I need help. (raised voice)
I need help. (coughing)

06:10.517 --> 06:12.285
- You okay?
- (whispers) Please help.

06:12.319 --> 06:13.987
Why don't I take you down
to emergency? (panting)

06:14.021 --> 06:15.622
Someone will be happy to help you
over there, all right? All right.

06:15.656 --> 06:17.290
- Okay?
- Don't-don't touch me!

06:17.324 --> 06:18.625
- Can I get some security here, please?
- Did I say you could touch me?

06:18.659 --> 06:20.526
Huh? You think... you think you...
(grunts) wh...

06:20.544 --> 06:22.462
Aah! Aah!

06:22.496 --> 06:24.831
(screaming)

06:24.865 --> 06:27.634
(grunts)

06:28.766 --> 06:30.470
Dr. Tolliver, what's up?

06:30.504 --> 06:31.971
John Doe. Homeless.

06:32.006 --> 06:34.307
Beaten up and left for dead
by a pack of teenagers.

06:34.341 --> 06:35.809
You're kidding. (sighs)

06:35.843 --> 06:38.144
Your friend Gavin found him.

06:38.179 --> 06:39.562
They patched him up in the E.R.,

06:39.597 --> 06:42.565
but he came in with preexisting pneumonia.

06:42.600 --> 06:44.651
Okay, uh, but Dr. Goran promised

06:44.685 --> 06:46.486
- to bring me into this big surgery, so...
- (chuckles) I don't care

06:46.520 --> 06:48.321
if he's taking you to Disneyland.

06:48.355 --> 06:50.657
Right now, you're needed
for a surgical consult.

06:50.691 --> 06:53.576
<i>(man speaks indistinctly over P.A.)</i>

06:53.611 --> 06:56.229

06:56.247 --> 06:59.082
Oh, my god.

06:59.116 --> 07:00.750
Some things you can't unsee.

07:00.785 --> 07:03.870
Abscess. Needs draining. He's all yours.

07:11.295 --> 07:13.429
How do you do this to another person?

07:13.464 --> 07:15.098
Don't know. Never want to.

07:15.132 --> 07:17.750
Can you get me a surgical
tray and a chlorhexidine prep?

07:17.768 --> 07:19.269
Yeah, sure thing.

07:19.303 --> 07:22.572
(telephone rings in distance)

07:22.606 --> 07:25.275

07:42.993 --> 07:45.011
(sighs)

07:47.832 --> 07:50.333
(knock on door)

07:53.921 --> 07:56.673
(sighs)

08:04.648 --> 08:06.482
Joel, what...

08:06.517 --> 08:08.401
Is Charlie okay?

08:08.435 --> 08:10.970
I'm not here about Charlie.

08:11.005 --> 08:12.471
She was nice to me.

08:12.489 --> 08:13.740
Something was wrong.

08:13.774 --> 08:14.974
This is all my fault.

08:14.992 --> 08:15.975
What are you talking about?

08:15.993 --> 08:17.660
Who falls asleep on the job?

08:17.695 --> 08:19.445
So you screwed up.

08:19.480 --> 08:20.780
Pick yourself up and do better.

08:20.814 --> 08:22.782
Well, I can't exactly go
waltzing back in there.

08:22.816 --> 08:26.085
You have to. What's your option?

08:26.120 --> 08:27.820
Giving up?

08:27.838 --> 08:29.455
I'm not giving up. Yes, you are.

08:29.489 --> 08:31.090
You're basically handing
Reycraft your job,

08:31.125 --> 08:32.575
and he will take it.

08:32.610 --> 08:34.159
Dana Kinney scares the hell out of me.

08:34.178 --> 08:36.629
Good, so channel that,
and show her exactly why

08:36.663 --> 08:38.965
Charlie made you chief
resident in the first place.

08:38.999 --> 08:42.467
(siren wailing)

08:45.356 --> 08:47.473
Oh, Dr. Reid. Feeling better?

08:47.507 --> 08:48.892
Like a million bucks.

08:48.943 --> 08:52.645
Yeah, I gave Perino the day off.
He was looking a little tired.

08:52.679 --> 08:56.349
(indistinct conversations)

08:56.367 --> 08:58.952
(wheels rattling)

08:58.986 --> 09:00.870
Thanks, Joe.

09:00.905 --> 09:02.622
All right, so Simons and I will start

09:02.656 --> 09:03.957
prepping the hands in the O.R.

09:03.991 --> 09:05.524
- We're gonna trim bones, tag tendons...
- Mm-hmm.

09:05.542 --> 09:07.994
Vessels, nerves, the usual drill.

09:08.028 --> 09:10.330
Let's give this man back his hands.

09:10.364 --> 09:11.381
(sighs)

09:15.189 --> 09:16.926
What else are we looking
at besides the hands?

09:17.002 --> 09:18.109
Crush injury to the right thigh.

09:18.177 --> 09:19.741
Forklift ran into him, pinned his legs,

09:19.775 --> 09:21.159
Pushed him right into the saw.

09:21.210 --> 09:23.161
We're looking at gross
contamination of the wounds.

09:23.212 --> 09:25.780
Give him a tetanus booster,
crossmatch 4 units of blood

09:25.798 --> 09:27.299
and start 2 liters of
saline at 200 an hour

09:27.333 --> 09:29.501
and hang 2 grams ancef,
5 milligrams per kilo of gent,

09:29.552 --> 09:30.552
and some fentanyl.

09:30.586 --> 09:31.970
How long is this gonna take?

09:32.004 --> 09:33.121
As long as an I.V. takes.

09:33.731 --> 09:34.923
- (panting) Doctor.
- Mm?

09:34.957 --> 09:36.457
<i>ÿHablas español?</i>

09:36.476 --> 09:37.592
<i>Si, un poco.</i>

09:37.626 --> 09:39.177
<i>Mi familia... I-I sent to
them money,</i>

09:39.228 --> 09:41.029
<i>pero... pero mis manos...</i>

09:41.063 --> 09:42.264
Uh, I...

09:42.298 --> 09:43.965
<i>ÿComo puedo
trabajar sin mis manos?</i>

09:44.000 --> 09:46.101
<i>Tenemos las manos. Vamos a...</i>

09:46.135 --> 09:47.302
(sighs, lowered voice)
They didn't teach me how

09:47.336 --> 09:49.437
to say "sew them back on"
in high school. Uh...

09:49.471 --> 09:52.524
<i>ÿpuede trabajar de nuevo?
(sighs)</i>

09:52.575 --> 09:53.525
He's talking about work, I think,

09:53.576 --> 09:54.659
if he'll ever work again.

09:54.694 --> 09:56.495
Well, you know, function will be reduced.

09:56.529 --> 09:59.030
I mean, he's never gonna
be a concert pianist,

09:59.081 --> 10:00.648
but, yeah, if the hands take,
he'll work again.

10:00.666 --> 10:03.368
(sigh) <i>Si, señor Pineda.
Esperamos.</i>

10:03.419 --> 10:05.086
- <i>Gracias.
- Reid.</i>

10:05.121 --> 10:07.655
Yeah.

10:07.673 --> 10:09.157
(lowered voice)
Joel wants you on this surgery,

10:09.175 --> 10:10.709
- but I don't, because right now...
- (grunts) Okay.

10:10.760 --> 10:12.177
I think you're a liability.

10:12.211 --> 10:14.045
(chuckles) Oh. Tell me how
you really feel, Dana.

10:14.096 --> 10:16.998
Zach, we've got a problem. (grunts)

10:18.230 --> 10:19.885
Okay. Run a dipstick.
That doesn't make any sense.

10:19.936 --> 10:21.436
I thought the trauma was to his leg.

10:21.855 --> 10:23.772
Pissing blood. No way
that's coming from his leg.

10:23.806 --> 10:26.942
I'm still not feeling anything.
Kidney and liver, all normal.

10:26.976 --> 10:29.778
What the hell?
(monitor beeping erratically)

10:29.812 --> 10:30.779
All right. Now his heart is starting

10:30.813 --> 10:32.364
to show signs of arrhythmia.

10:32.398 --> 10:33.732
Dipstick's positive for blood.

10:33.783 --> 10:35.984
Yes, but that shouldn't affect his heart.

10:36.018 --> 10:37.285
Gotta be a kidney or bladder injury. Reid?

10:37.320 --> 10:38.686
Come on. What are we gonna do?

10:38.704 --> 10:39.687
Do we need to open him up, take a look?

10:39.705 --> 10:41.039
No, no. Just wait just a minute.

10:41.073 --> 10:42.523
What if it's a false positive?

10:42.542 --> 10:45.243
The forklift crushes his leg,
causing severe muscle damage,

10:45.294 --> 10:47.362
dumping myoglobin into his system.

10:47.380 --> 10:48.914
Myoglobin colors urine red.

10:48.948 --> 10:50.749
It wreaks havoc with potassium levels.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.867
And high potassium levels
causes heart problems.

10:52.885 --> 10:53.969
Rhabdomyolysis.

10:54.003 --> 10:55.804
I think so, and if we don't flush

10:55.838 --> 10:57.556
this myoglobin out of
his system right now,

10:57.590 --> 10:59.057
we're looking at total renal failure,

10:59.091 --> 11:00.809
and his kidneys will be toast.

11:00.843 --> 11:02.344
Let's not lose him.

11:02.378 --> 11:04.262
Olivia, start saline at
500 milliliters an hour.

11:04.313 --> 11:05.880
Let's get his urine output up to 200,

11:05.898 --> 11:08.066
and bicarb... 3 amps in 1 liter d5w

11:08.100 --> 11:09.484
at 100 milliliters an hour.

11:09.518 --> 11:11.386
Let's get him on some mannitol.
We've got it from here.

11:11.404 --> 11:13.738
Today's not your lucky day, bud.

11:13.773 --> 11:15.607
Go grab a coffee.

11:15.658 --> 11:17.158
I don't need a coffee. I'm good.

11:17.193 --> 11:20.228
I do. Black. One sweetener. Go.

11:20.246 --> 11:23.231
(inhales deeply and sighs)

11:23.249 --> 11:24.282
So we'll irrigate the hands,

11:24.333 --> 11:25.450
expose the neurovascular structures

11:25.501 --> 11:26.918
and tag 'em, and then I'm gonna trim

11:26.953 --> 11:29.737
- about a centimeter of bone off each hand.
- All right. Yeah.

11:29.755 --> 11:31.339
All scrubbed in and
ready to go, Dr. Goran.

11:31.374 --> 11:32.924
Maggie.

11:32.959 --> 11:35.043
Yeah.

11:35.077 --> 11:37.796
I'm sorry. Uh... (sighs)

11:37.847 --> 11:39.180
I didn't get to ask Kinney about you.

11:39.215 --> 11:40.932
I've been too busy fighting for Dr. Reid.

11:40.967 --> 11:42.083
Dr. Reid?

11:42.101 --> 11:44.552
Yes. She has the skills I need for this.

11:44.586 --> 11:46.521
It's not just any old surgery.

11:46.555 --> 11:49.174
I know. That's why
I wanted to be a part of it.

11:49.208 --> 11:53.028
Right. Well, um, I said I would try,

11:53.062 --> 11:56.564
and it didn't work out.
Thanks for your understanding.

12:03.906 --> 12:06.374
Breaking hearts, huh, Dr. Goran?

12:06.409 --> 12:07.709
It wasn't personal.

12:07.743 --> 12:09.210
Mm-hmm.

12:09.245 --> 12:11.746
(sighs) That's the way it's gotta be.

12:12.948 --> 12:15.950
(spritzing and scraping)

12:17.586 --> 12:19.454
(door creaks)

12:19.472 --> 12:20.972
(chuckles)

12:22.791 --> 12:24.625
Do you want to come
over and clean my place?

12:24.644 --> 12:28.096
(scoffs) Everyone's worried
about salmonella, right?

12:28.130 --> 12:29.464
(chuckles) There's a whole phylum

12:29.482 --> 12:31.232
of contaminants in a
food environment, Alex.

12:31.267 --> 12:33.518
There's, uh, campylobacter, listeria,

12:33.569 --> 12:35.654
fungi like aspergillus niger.

12:35.688 --> 12:37.522
(chuckles) That can lead to a
pretty nasty lung infection,

12:37.573 --> 12:38.973
Alex, I'm telling you.

12:38.991 --> 12:41.642
Aspergillosis? I think we're okay.

12:41.661 --> 12:46.665
So, uh, Victor told me you were sent home?

12:47.667 --> 12:50.168
I was. I'm back.

12:50.202 --> 12:52.537
Everything okay? Would you like to talk?

12:52.588 --> 12:53.538
About?

12:53.589 --> 12:55.674
Anything. Charlie if you want.

12:55.708 --> 12:58.293
Uh, you know, I'm, uh,
I'm a very good listener.

12:58.327 --> 13:00.378
I've already talked
your ear off about Charlie.

13:00.429 --> 13:02.797
Not medically. I mean...

13:02.831 --> 13:04.182
How are you doing?

13:04.216 --> 13:06.885
Me? Well...

13:08.721 --> 13:10.305
I'm exhausted.

13:10.339 --> 13:12.640
I'm seeing things. Don't ask.

13:12.674 --> 13:13.975
And I'm fighting for my job,

13:14.009 --> 13:17.445
and I'm starting to wonder,
what if this is it?

13:17.480 --> 13:19.114
So? What if this is it?

13:20.199 --> 13:22.117
Too blunt.

13:22.151 --> 13:23.284
Kinda.

13:23.319 --> 13:25.070
Charlie's been in a coma for a few weeks.

13:25.121 --> 13:27.122
You know, comas last for years,
decades even.

13:27.156 --> 13:28.656
Uh, I'm not saying to give up hope.

13:28.690 --> 13:29.741
You better not be. (chuckles)

13:29.792 --> 13:31.826
I'm just saying, what if this is it, Alex?

13:31.860 --> 13:33.945
I mean, what are you gonna do a week,
a month, a year,

13:33.979 --> 13:35.046
five years from now, hmm?

13:35.081 --> 13:37.132
I think you owe it to
yourself to answer that.

13:37.166 --> 13:38.550
Look at this.

13:38.584 --> 13:40.668
So you've been in a coma for 27 years?

13:40.702 --> 13:44.139
Yeah. Almost half my life, but no regrets.

13:44.173 --> 13:45.590
You sound surprised.

13:45.641 --> 13:47.708
No. I mean, I've heard of
comas lasting for decades,

13:47.727 --> 13:49.060
but that's not the norm.

13:49.095 --> 13:52.180
It isn't. I must be lucky.
How'd you bite it?

13:52.214 --> 13:54.516
Oh, let me guess. Car crash, right?

13:54.550 --> 13:55.650
Yep.

13:55.684 --> 13:57.685
Yeah. This is, uh, week five for me.

13:57.719 --> 13:59.437
Oh, well, you'll wake up any day now.

13:59.488 --> 14:01.406
Hello, nurse.

14:01.440 --> 14:02.524
(chuckles) See, the best thing

14:02.558 --> 14:04.526
about being invisible is being invisible.

14:04.560 --> 14:06.227
- Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait...
- Hey.

14:06.245 --> 14:08.446
Listen, uh, you're the first person I met

14:08.497 --> 14:10.532
who-who knows more about this than I do.

14:10.566 --> 14:11.699
Help me.

14:11.733 --> 14:14.252
Well, first of all, don't touch the suit.

14:14.286 --> 14:17.589
Secondly, I'm not a "person,"
and neither are you,

14:17.623 --> 14:19.207
and thirdly, would it kill
you to have a bit of fun?

14:19.241 --> 14:20.425
Come on.

14:20.459 --> 14:21.676
I'm in a coma.

14:21.710 --> 14:23.077
Oh, I get it.

14:23.095 --> 14:26.798
You're feeling bunk and crunchy
when you wanna feel <i>ace.</i>

14:26.849 --> 14:29.267
Hey, I got an idea. Let's...

14:29.301 --> 14:30.769
let's book and get some air.

14:30.803 --> 14:31.770
Aah!

14:31.804 --> 14:36.057
Hey, easy, easy, easy. (chuckles)

14:36.091 --> 14:38.276
It's cool, right?

14:38.310 --> 14:40.428
Yeah.

14:40.446 --> 14:44.732
So do you believe what you said
about me waking up any day?

14:44.766 --> 14:47.535
(chuckles) No. Come on.

14:47.570 --> 14:50.388
What do you want from me?
I see them come and go.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.407
Mostly go, to be honest with you.

14:52.441 --> 14:54.125
Yeah, walking into the light.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.377
It's a very sweet moment
when a loved one passes on.

14:56.412 --> 14:58.413
It's very deep. It's very meaningful.

14:58.447 --> 15:01.449
So no tips on how to wake up?

15:01.467 --> 15:04.052
What part of "being in a coma
for 27 years" didn't you get?

15:04.086 --> 15:05.620
My fiancee saw me the other day.

15:05.638 --> 15:07.055
- Oh, she looked at you?
- Yeah.

15:07.089 --> 15:09.057
It's impossible.
You're going nuts, my friend.

15:09.091 --> 15:10.958
It really sucks to be you.

15:10.976 --> 15:12.393
Hey. Aah!

15:12.428 --> 15:15.563
Whoo! (laughs)

15:15.598 --> 15:19.300
We've just stabilized him, Dana.
He can't go under the knife.

15:19.318 --> 15:20.968
This surgery is a one-shot deal.

15:20.986 --> 15:22.303
- I get it.
- Do you?

15:22.321 --> 15:23.938
Because if we don't replant
the hands now, they die.

15:23.972 --> 15:26.157
Well, it's better that than
he crashes during surgery.

15:26.192 --> 15:27.308
It's not gonna happen.

15:27.326 --> 15:30.078
Fine. Your patient. Your call.

15:30.112 --> 15:31.663
Thank you. Guys. All right.

15:31.697 --> 15:35.283
Take Mr. Pineda up to O.R. three, please.

15:35.317 --> 15:37.151
You can go up with 'em.

15:37.169 --> 15:38.586
I'm part of this surgery?

15:38.621 --> 15:40.788
Don't make me regret it.

15:46.529 --> 15:48.797
It's been four hours,
and ischemia is a concern,

15:48.831 --> 15:50.382
so we need to get that blood flowing.

15:50.416 --> 15:51.917
(Dana) All right. We'll do ortho first.

15:51.968 --> 15:53.535
Secure the bones, then arteries,

15:53.553 --> 15:55.703
veins, tendons, nerves, in that order.

15:55.722 --> 15:58.173
Okay, teams, let's go.

15:58.207 --> 16:01.209
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

16:03.396 --> 16:07.315
(chuckles) You looked freakin' terrified.

16:07.350 --> 16:08.734
Come on.

16:09.736 --> 16:12.887
You... you... you pushed me!

16:12.905 --> 16:15.490
(laughing) You totally
thought you were gonna die.

16:15.525 --> 16:17.725
You're already dead. Come on.

16:17.744 --> 16:19.361
Well, you're sorta dead.
You know what I mean.

16:19.395 --> 16:21.396
Hey, do you wanna go do it again?

16:21.414 --> 16:23.398
- No.
- Just for kicks. Come on.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.567
I, uh, how can you be so
cavalier about all this?

16:25.585 --> 16:27.753
Well, how can you be so depressed?

16:27.787 --> 16:30.071
It's like you're happy being in a coma.

16:30.089 --> 16:33.741
Well, uh, insanity... doing the same thing

16:33.760 --> 16:36.094
over and over again and
expecting different results.

16:36.129 --> 16:37.245
You're quoting Einstein now?

16:37.263 --> 16:39.181
No, no, no. I'm making a point, okay?

16:39.215 --> 16:40.248
I don't expect things to change,

16:40.266 --> 16:43.218
but you do, so who's crazier here?

16:43.252 --> 16:44.219
You've given up.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.054
No. I've adapted.

16:46.088 --> 16:47.305
That thing back there in the I.C.U.,

16:47.356 --> 16:50.192
that old, wrinkled mummy?

16:50.226 --> 16:54.929
This is me, and this is you now,
chuck, okay?

16:54.947 --> 16:56.615
This is your new reality.

16:56.649 --> 16:59.701
Your old life is just a dream,
so you just gotta, you know,

16:59.735 --> 17:02.770
let it go and everything'll be fine.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.122
I don't believe you.

17:04.156 --> 17:05.123
Well, you should,

17:05.157 --> 17:06.741
because I've been to hell and back.

17:06.776 --> 17:09.877
You're-you're happy here?

17:09.912 --> 17:11.695
As a clam.

17:20.122 --> 17:21.388
(sniffles)

17:21.424 --> 17:23.224
(monitor beeping rhythmically,
ventilator hissing)

17:23.259 --> 17:24.392
How are you doing?

17:26.095 --> 17:28.930
"John Doe." That's not a name.

17:29.101 --> 17:30.773
What should <i>I</i> call you?

17:32.101 --> 17:38.323
Mr. Darcy? You're mysterious, aloof.

17:38.357 --> 17:40.659
First name...

17:40.693 --> 17:42.494
Fitzwilliam.

17:42.528 --> 17:45.330
Not common knowledge, but...

17:45.364 --> 17:48.200
(telephone rings in distance)

17:54.006 --> 17:56.591
Am I seeing things,
or is his abdomen distended?

17:56.626 --> 17:57.676
Yeah, a bit.

17:57.710 --> 17:58.993
How's his urine output? Low?

17:59.011 --> 18:00.045
Borderline?

18:00.079 --> 18:01.596
It's low. And his bladder pressure?

18:01.631 --> 18:02.597
Is it elevated?

18:02.632 --> 18:04.466
Nope. 15. He's normal.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.518
Huh.

18:06.552 --> 18:09.003
(sniffles) Okay.

18:09.021 --> 18:11.022
Thanks.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.860
(people speaking indistinctly)

18:15.231 --> 18:16.862
Our John Doe is struggling in there.

18:16.896 --> 18:18.530
Antibiotics take a few days.

18:18.564 --> 18:20.448
What if it's pneumonia?

18:20.483 --> 18:21.616
I'm not questioning your judgment...

18:21.651 --> 18:22.817
Glad to hear it.

18:22.851 --> 18:24.686
But he's had a lot of
difficulty breathing.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.371
He suffered trauma to his abdomen,

18:26.405 --> 18:28.657
received a lot of fluids,
and now it's distended,

18:28.691 --> 18:30.709
so what if it's A.C.S., abdominal...

18:30.743 --> 18:32.878
Compartment syndrome?

18:32.912 --> 18:35.046
Have you checked his bladder pressure?

18:35.081 --> 18:37.532
And what was his latest I.A.P.?

18:37.567 --> 18:38.967
15.

18:39.001 --> 18:43.004
15? If it was a.C.S.,
it'd be more like 25 or higher.

18:43.038 --> 18:45.056
(sighs) Maggie.

18:45.091 --> 18:46.758
(chuckles) Look, I get it.

18:46.809 --> 18:48.226
You're trying to get noticed,

18:48.848 --> 18:50.679
but I didn't call you down
here to diagnose my patient.

18:50.713 --> 18:52.714
I called you down here
to drain an abscess.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.916
Think horses, not zebras.

18:54.951 --> 18:56.351
Okay.

18:56.385 --> 18:57.519
(telephone rings in distance)

18:57.553 --> 19:00.188
(sighs)

19:00.222 --> 19:02.857
Heparinized saline.

19:02.891 --> 19:05.994
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

19:06.028 --> 19:07.279
(squirts)

19:09.231 --> 19:12.584
Ron, can you cut this here, please?

19:12.618 --> 19:14.419
(snip)

19:16.205 --> 19:17.839
One more 8-0, Victor.

19:17.873 --> 19:19.541
(instrument clatters)

19:19.575 --> 19:21.259
Rounding the finish line.

19:21.294 --> 19:24.546
One more throw.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.381
Here we go.

19:26.415 --> 19:30.051
And... I'm done.

19:30.085 --> 19:32.721
Good work. All right.
Time to test his pipes.

19:32.755 --> 19:34.222
Deflate the tourniquet and
restore the blood flow.

19:34.256 --> 19:36.057
Yes, Dr. Kinney. Macara? (monitor beeps)

19:36.091 --> 19:38.026
One hand good. Two hands better.

19:38.060 --> 19:40.028
It's a marathon, not a sprint. (sighs)

19:40.062 --> 19:41.763
Doctor, your hand isn't pinking up.

19:41.781 --> 19:42.864
(monitor beeps)

19:42.898 --> 19:44.566
Is the tourniquet...

19:44.600 --> 19:46.934
Completely deflated.

19:46.953 --> 19:49.237
Blood should be getting in.
It's not. What's wrong?

19:49.271 --> 19:54.292
Maybe there's a clot or arterial spasm.

19:54.327 --> 19:56.411
Done. Reestablish blood flow, Victor.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.747
You know, instead of trying to
go for some suturing record,

19:58.781 --> 20:00.715
you might want to think
about your patient.

20:00.750 --> 20:01.967
Excuse me?

20:02.001 --> 20:06.254
Left hand pinking up nicely,
Dr. Reid. Patency confirmed.

20:06.288 --> 20:08.256
Yes. Yeah. All right. All right!

20:08.290 --> 20:10.809
(sighs) The zone of
the injury must be too big.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.477
That-that's why it's not perfusing.

20:12.511 --> 20:14.145
Okay, we don't have enough time.

20:14.180 --> 20:15.463
(Joel) Alex, take a look at this, please.

20:15.481 --> 20:16.564
I just told you it's...

20:16.599 --> 20:17.849
Okay.

20:17.900 --> 20:19.401
Let her in.

20:19.435 --> 20:20.402
(sighs)

20:20.436 --> 20:22.237
Just a fresh set of eyes.

20:22.271 --> 20:23.238
You're up.

20:23.272 --> 20:27.642
Okay. (sighs)

20:29.612 --> 20:31.079
Talk to me, Reid.

20:31.113 --> 20:32.247
What do you see?

20:32.281 --> 20:34.749
Looks like you picked up the back wall,

20:34.784 --> 20:37.002
so the artery is constricted
and there's no blood flow.

20:37.036 --> 20:39.621
So you hooked up the artery,
and you sewed it shut?

20:39.655 --> 20:41.623
It happens, Joel. Back off.

20:41.657 --> 20:43.675
You just need to get in, cut the sutures,

20:43.709 --> 20:47.512
redo the anastomosis.
There's still time to save it.

20:47.546 --> 20:49.764
You're not touching that hand.
Reid, patient's yours.

20:49.799 --> 20:51.332
Dr. Kinney. Listen,
I don't care about feelings.

20:51.350 --> 20:53.668
I care about saving those hands.
You hear me?

20:53.686 --> 20:55.970
(wheels rattle)

20:56.004 --> 20:57.939
(thuds)

20:57.973 --> 20:59.274
(sighs)

20:59.308 --> 21:01.342
Loud and clear.

21:06.018 --> 21:08.836
(people speaking indistinctly)

21:08.887 --> 21:10.421
(thuds) I have a patient
who is going to die,

21:10.455 --> 21:11.639
but Dr. Tolliver won't listen to me,

21:11.673 --> 21:13.791
because how could I,
a lowly surgical resident,

21:13.809 --> 21:15.292
possibly know what I'm talking about?

21:15.310 --> 21:16.928
Whoa, whoa. (chuckles) Maggie, slow down.

21:16.962 --> 21:18.930
Okay. Here's the situation.

21:18.964 --> 21:21.532
My patient looks like
he has textbook pneumonia.

21:21.566 --> 21:24.268
But I think it's something way worse.

21:24.303 --> 21:25.503
Way worse how?

21:25.537 --> 21:27.154
Well, how much general
surgery do you remember?

21:27.189 --> 21:29.273
Uh, none.

21:29.307 --> 21:31.108
Those are Reycraft's.

21:31.142 --> 21:32.860
He eats them raw, calls them
"nature's energy drink."

21:32.911 --> 21:34.979
Reycraft is a weirdo.

21:34.997 --> 21:37.531
So here's the dealio.

21:37.582 --> 21:39.316
If my patient has what I think he has,

21:39.334 --> 21:43.153
there's this crazy pressure
building up in his abdomen. (beeps)

21:43.171 --> 21:46.323
It's blocking off blood flow
to the bowel, to the kidneys.

21:46.341 --> 21:47.675
We're having trouble ventilating him,

21:47.709 --> 21:49.260
but it's not because of the pneumonia.

21:49.294 --> 21:51.262
it's because, inside,
he's a pressure cooker,

21:51.296 --> 21:52.997
and if the pressure
isn't released in time...

21:53.015 --> 21:54.548
(thuds, beeps) Whoa.

21:56.318 --> 21:57.635
He'll explode?

21:57.669 --> 22:00.521
No, but he'll suffer
multiorgan system failure

22:00.555 --> 22:01.689
and then die.

22:03.436 --> 22:04.842
Ask Dr. Reid.

22:04.860 --> 22:06.560
She's in surgery.

22:06.611 --> 22:08.229
Then go back to Dr. Tolliver again.

22:08.263 --> 22:09.780
My patient is dying!

22:09.815 --> 22:11.065
Are you sure about that?

22:14.953 --> 22:18.355
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

22:18.373 --> 22:20.541
Artery successfully detached.

22:20.575 --> 22:23.828
Time to start all over again. 8-0, Victor.

22:38.677 --> 22:41.645
Okay. That should do the trick. (sighs)

22:43.181 --> 22:44.315
Tourniquet down.

22:44.349 --> 22:45.649
(monitor beeps)

22:45.684 --> 22:47.735
(sighs)

22:49.654 --> 22:52.106
- Come on. Come on. Pink up.
- (Joel) Come on.

22:52.157 --> 22:54.275
- Come on. Pink up.
- Come on.
- What's happening?

22:54.309 --> 22:55.860
Blood's still not flowing.

22:55.894 --> 22:57.995
I told you, there has
to be something else.

22:58.030 --> 22:59.663
(sighs)

22:59.698 --> 23:02.033
Let's see if gravity will help us. Victor?

23:02.067 --> 23:04.535
(whispers indistinctly)

23:04.569 --> 23:06.587
- Good?
- Yeah, and...

23:15.530 --> 23:17.014
(chuckles)

23:17.049 --> 23:19.050
(cheering)

23:19.084 --> 23:21.185
- Yes. Nice one, Reid.
- Yes! (laughs)

23:21.219 --> 23:22.686
- Thank you.
- Well done.

23:22.721 --> 23:25.389
Okay. Let's reattach some veins
to establish venus return.

23:25.423 --> 23:26.440
Then we'll do the radial arteries,

23:26.475 --> 23:27.808
and then on to plastics.

23:27.859 --> 23:30.061
All right. Reycraft, come on.
Let the real work begin!

23:30.095 --> 23:33.280
It could've happened to anyone.
Don't be so hard on yourself.

23:33.315 --> 23:35.449
- Yeah.
- (sighs) Sure.

23:35.484 --> 23:37.434
- Reid?
- Yeah?

23:37.452 --> 23:38.903
Well done.

23:38.937 --> 23:40.488
Thanks.

23:41.957 --> 23:44.942
It can't eat on its own.
It can't breathe on its own.

23:44.960 --> 23:48.112
There's nothing firing
in the old <i>cabeza.</i>

23:48.130 --> 23:49.914
You still think that's you, huh?

23:49.948 --> 23:52.633
That's been me for the last 40 years.

23:52.667 --> 23:54.051
You gotta move on, man.

23:54.086 --> 23:55.052
Thank you for coming.

23:55.087 --> 23:57.121
Yes. Well, where is he?

23:57.139 --> 23:58.789
You gotta be kidding me.

23:58.807 --> 24:01.792
The nurse says he has pneumonia.

24:01.810 --> 24:03.194
What the hell are you doing here?

24:03.228 --> 24:05.429
What... no. Hey, you!

24:05.463 --> 24:07.202
- No, you can't... you... don't let'em in there!
- Scott!

24:07.232 --> 24:07.732
Hey! Hey!

24:07.732 --> 24:10.818
- (Scott) Stay out!
- It's bilateral, meaning in both lungs.

24:10.852 --> 24:12.653
We've given him antibiotics,

24:12.687 --> 24:14.488
but due to his age and condition,

24:14.523 --> 24:16.490
the prognosis isn't very good.

24:16.525 --> 24:18.325
And there's no one else
you could've called,

24:18.360 --> 24:19.910
a member of his family?

24:19.945 --> 24:22.997
Your wife was listed as
Mr. Cockburn's next of kin.

24:23.031 --> 24:25.149
If he codes, we'll have to revive him,

24:25.167 --> 24:29.270
but again, considering
his age and his condition...

24:29.304 --> 24:31.939
(monitor beeping rhythmically,
ventilator hissing)

24:31.973 --> 24:33.507
Maybe we shouldn't.

24:34.993 --> 24:38.379
Uh, I... it would be a blessing.

24:38.430 --> 24:42.049
(chuckles) "It would be a blessing."

24:42.100 --> 24:44.135
Who is she?

24:44.169 --> 24:46.470
She's my...

24:46.504 --> 24:51.308
(sighs) wife. She's my ex-wife.

24:52.994 --> 24:55.446
Don't.

24:55.480 --> 24:57.414
Don't revive him.

24:57.449 --> 25:00.267
(Melanda) Okay.

25:08.026 --> 25:11.162
They forget about you, Charlie.

25:11.196 --> 25:13.164
They always do.

25:17.385 --> 25:18.535
Blood flow is reestablished,

25:18.553 --> 25:21.338
bones plated, nerves,
tendons hooked back up.

25:21.372 --> 25:23.507
It's in the hands of
the hand gods now, huh?

25:23.541 --> 25:24.675
I think his chances are good.

25:24.709 --> 25:26.543
Yeah. Can't ask for much better than that.

25:26.561 --> 25:27.544
(telephone rings)

25:27.562 --> 25:28.846
Good work, team.

25:28.880 --> 25:30.014
(chuckles)

25:30.048 --> 25:31.398
- Thanks.
- Reycraft.

25:31.433 --> 25:33.734
Suck it up.

25:33.768 --> 25:36.053
You picked up the back wall.
It could've happened to anyone.

25:36.071 --> 25:37.938
Didn't happen to you.

25:40.158 --> 25:44.612
So, Alex, we'll all be over for 8:00?

25:44.663 --> 25:46.330
What are you talking about?

25:46.364 --> 25:48.449
The hero of the surgery
buys everyone dinner.

25:48.500 --> 25:52.286
It's Dr. Kinney's new thing
since she became chief.

25:52.337 --> 25:54.872
That's right. It's team-building.

25:54.906 --> 25:58.125
You order some chinese.
I bring the beer and wine.

25:58.176 --> 25:59.176
Sound good?

26:00.495 --> 26:01.879
Sure.

26:01.913 --> 26:06.217
Perfect. I'm going to accompany
Mr. Pineda up to I.C.U.

26:07.686 --> 26:09.220
- Oh, and, Reid?
- Yeah?

26:09.254 --> 26:11.305
Don't skimp on the general tsao chicken.

26:11.356 --> 26:13.307
Yeah.

26:13.358 --> 26:16.026
(telephone rings)

26:16.061 --> 26:18.195
Did she just invite half
of Hope-Zee to my place?

26:18.230 --> 26:20.364
She just did, yeah.

26:20.398 --> 26:22.433
Guess I'll have to go home
and clean up. (chuckles)

26:22.467 --> 26:24.485
So I guess I'll...

26:24.536 --> 26:26.770
See you about 8:00.

26:26.788 --> 26:28.772
Joel?

26:28.790 --> 26:30.407
Thanks for the pep talk. I owe you one.

26:32.410 --> 26:34.411
(monitors beeping)

26:34.445 --> 26:37.948
(beeping continues)
(indistinct conversations)

26:37.966 --> 26:41.552
<i>(woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.)</i>

26:45.140 --> 26:46.473
(monitor beeps) You wanna talk?

26:46.508 --> 26:48.726
No.

26:48.760 --> 26:50.561
Okay.

26:50.595 --> 26:52.629
(inhales sharply)

26:52.647 --> 26:54.965
She's so old.

26:54.983 --> 26:57.384
(speaking indistinctly) Melissa.

26:57.419 --> 26:58.635
That happens, Scott.

26:58.653 --> 27:00.137
I put her out of my mind for years,

27:00.155 --> 27:01.638
and she shows up here,
and I'm looking at her now.

27:01.656 --> 27:03.440
What do I see? I see someone
who's had a full life...

27:03.474 --> 27:04.808
a full life!

27:04.826 --> 27:06.643
Without me.

27:06.661 --> 27:08.195
And that hurts.

27:10.498 --> 27:12.316
I mean, what else?

27:12.334 --> 27:14.084
What else did I miss?

27:14.119 --> 27:16.787
Anniversaries, birthdays...
we could have had kids.

27:16.821 --> 27:19.256
Wait-wait a minute.
When's the last time you saw her?

27:19.291 --> 27:22.159
June 14th, 1987.

27:22.177 --> 27:24.178
She came...

27:24.212 --> 27:26.430
(sighs) she spent ten minutes,
and then she left.

27:26.464 --> 27:29.433
And then I kept waiting for her
to come back, and she never did.

27:29.467 --> 27:31.769
And then...

27:31.803 --> 27:34.171
two months later, we were divorced.

27:34.189 --> 27:36.940
Yeah, my sister, god rest her...

27:36.975 --> 27:39.610
she signed the papers for me.

27:39.644 --> 27:43.447
That, uh... that totally sucks.

27:43.481 --> 27:46.116
(both laugh)

27:46.151 --> 27:49.953
Sorry. (laughing)

27:49.988 --> 27:53.207
Well, "till death do us part"
and all that crap, huh?

27:53.241 --> 27:55.459
I fell for that hook, line,
and sinker, I tell you.

27:55.493 --> 27:59.496
But Melissa... ah, she never loved me.

27:59.530 --> 28:00.998
You don't know that.

28:04.219 --> 28:07.221
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

28:12.844 --> 28:14.912
How was your day?

28:14.946 --> 28:16.647
Disconcerting. How was yours?

28:16.681 --> 28:18.248
'Cause mine was pretty weird.

28:18.283 --> 28:20.150
I went home.

28:20.185 --> 28:21.802
Our home?

28:21.836 --> 28:23.654
I, uh, picked up our mail
and tried to sleep,

28:23.688 --> 28:24.988
but I couldn't.

28:25.023 --> 28:26.407
Came back in, fought for my job...

28:26.441 --> 28:29.743
(breathes deeply)
and I sewed a guy's hands back on.

28:29.778 --> 28:32.496
That went pretty well.

28:32.530 --> 28:36.333
(inhales) Okay. Um... I gotta go,

28:36.368 --> 28:38.285
but I will be back first
thing in the morning.

28:41.005 --> 28:42.289
(kiss)

28:48.177 --> 28:49.913
And she's gone.

28:53.107 --> 28:56.043
<i>(retro pop music playing)</i>

28:56.077 --> 28:58.545
(indistinct conversations)

28:58.579 --> 29:01.665
Shahir, you're totally bogarting
the beef and broccoli, man.

29:01.699 --> 29:04.501
Mm. I don't share.

29:06.037 --> 29:07.554
That's like saying,
"I don't share ethiopian."

29:07.588 --> 29:08.872
- I don't.
- (laughing) It's true.

'Cause, wow.

29:41.039 --> 29:43.373
nice and caring and, you know, supportive,

29:43.407 --> 29:46.376
and so that is my way of doing it.

29:46.410 --> 29:49.245
- Okay?
- Oh. O-okay.

29:49.263 --> 29:51.098

34:00.181 --> 34:01.664
(laughing) and I gotta sneeze.

34:01.682 --> 34:03.499
And you know that feeling
where it's right there,

34:03.517 --> 34:05.602

a lot of little needles...
- The worst.

34:15.896 --> 34:17.230
Overstimulation of the optic nerve

which leads to

34:19.183 --> 34:20.650
the photic optic sneeze reflex. It...

34:20.684 --> 34:23.036
Yes! Well played!
It was the mother of all sneezes,

34:23.070 --> 34:25.288

to drop her forehead into place...

34:25.288 --> 34:25.687

34:28.074 --> 34:29.755
to peel her forehead off
the ceiling, right?

34:29.786 --> 34:30.560
Agreed.

34:30.647 --> 34:32.712
Photoptarmosis is very interesting.

34:32.746 --> 34:34.380

a third of the population,

40:36.846 --> 40:38.280
Skim or 2%?

40:38.315 --> 40:40.699
No. For real.

40:40.734 --> 40:42.351
You got me jewelry.

40:42.369 --> 40:44.353

Sweetheart...

I know. They were my dad's.

41:01.171 --> 41:03.205
I-I didn't really keep
anything of his after he died.

41:03.223 --> 41:05.558
Um, my mom didn't want
'em 'cause she was sad,

41:05.592 --> 41:08.227
and my brothers would have
lost or sold them, so...

41:08.261 --> 41:10.813
- I love them.
- You don't have to wear them.

41:10.847 --> 41:12.438
- I can buy you something newer...
- Alex.

41:12.468 --> 41:13.659
- That's nicer...
- Alex.

41:13.733 --> 41:14.733
Yeah?

41:14.768 --> 41:15.918
I love them.

41:15.952 --> 41:18.571
I mean,

41:18.605 --> 41:20.356
they're a part of you.

41:21.491 --> 41:23.075
And I'll tell you what.

41:23.109 --> 41:26.078
The very next time we get
dressed up for anything,

41:26.112 --> 41:28.330
I'm gonna wear them.

41:28.365 --> 41:29.915
(snaps case)

41:29.950 --> 41:32.585
But we better put them somewhere
where they won't get lost,

41:35.422 --> 41:37.089
Not saying who.

41:37.123 --> 41:39.008
Works about a hundred hours a week

41:39.042 --> 41:41.427
and, uh, can barely find
her own bra in the morning.

41:41.461 --> 41:43.679
Well, that's just because
you keep taking it off.

41:43.713 --> 41:45.180
- I do.
- Mm-hmm.

41:45.215 --> 41:46.682
I do that. Why is that?

41:46.716 --> 41:48.584
I don't know, but I think
we should be getting you

41:48.602 --> 41:51.687
a consult of some kind,
maybe like a sex doctor.

41:51.721 --> 41:53.389
