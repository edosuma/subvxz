tomorrow.</i>

00:07.320 --> 00:09.120
<i>Were you and him close?</i>

00:16.200 --> 00:18.200
<i>Tell me about him.</i>

00:19.440 --> 00:20.960
<i>Your dad.</i>

00:22.080 --> 00:23.560
<i>Football.</i>

00:25.240 --> 00:26.960

00:32.240 --> 00:34.480
<i>The day that Hearts bottled it.</i>

<i>You and Les.</i>

00:47.400 --> 00:48.920
<i>Aye.</i>

00:49.960 --> 00:51.440
<i>It was, er...</i>

00:52.480 --> 00:54.640
<i>It was the day before the match.</i>

00:54.640 --> 00:56.760
<i>Gi' us a gam, then.
Dinnae be a fucking tease.</i> <i>No.</i>

00:56.760 --> 00:58.760
<i>Why no? You said... Come on!
I said no!</i>

00:58.760 --> 01:01.200

01:07.640 --> 01:09.280
<i>Fellatio.</i>

01:13.800 --> 01:15.960
<i>What do you think made him
so aggressive?</i>

01:20.160 --> 01:22.520
<i>Fuelled by shame, I suppose.</i>

01:26.960 --> 01:28.680
<i>It's always the shame.</i>

01:30.920 --> 01:32.560
<i>What happened...</i>

01:33.920 --> 01:36.480
<i>..that time in the tunnel.</i>

01:36.480 --> 01:37.920
<i>What tunnel?</i>

01:46.360 --> 01:48.920
<i>You believe that violence
is fuelled by shame?</i>

01:52.000 --> 01:54.360

<i>Les.</i>

02:03.400 --> 02:04.920
<i>Before...</i>

02:06.360 --> 02:08.200
<i>..he was just a kid.</i>

02:09.840 --> 02:11.200
<i>Playful...</i>

02:12.440 --> 02:14.000
<i>..happy.</i>

<i>HE SNIFFLES</i>

02:29.960 --> 02:32.120

02:33.280 --> 02:34.600
<i>I suppose so.</i>

02:35.600 --> 02:36.840
<i>Where'd you get them?</i>

02:38.360 --> 02:42.600
<i>Probably some...
stationery trade catalogue.</i>

02:42.600 --> 02:46.040
<i>Almost everything I say or do
ends up in these pages.</i>

02:54.200 --> 02:56.480

02:56.480 --> 02:57.760
<i>No.</i>

02:59.040 --> 03:01.600
<i>No, I-I cannae talk about that
right now.</i>

03:01.600 --> 03:03.200
<i>Another time maybe, yeah?</i>

03:05.880 --> 03:09.440
<i>It turned Les into a bully.
What about you?</i>

03:10.480 --> 03:11.920
<i>What did you become?</i>

03:13.000 --> 03:15.240
<i>A cop who has to get back to work.</i>

03:16.280 --> 03:17.720
<i>Is that all?</i>

03:30.680 --> 03:33.120

<i>'We all get glimpses,

<i>DOOR UNLOCKS</i>

<i>What's this we're getting now?
He does them compulsively.</i>

04:08.560 --> 04:10.880
<i>50 push-up, 50 sit-ups.
Rarely stops.</i>

04:10.880 --> 04:12.800
<i>Fitness junkie.</i>

04:12.800 --> 04:15.640
<i>Is he ex-forces?
No, just the TA.</i>

04:15.640 --> 04:19.120
<i>Classic finishing school
for inadequate perverts.</i>

04:19.120 --> 04:20.480
<i>I used to be in the Terries.</i>

04:23.480 --> 04:27.040
<i>Anyway, I've been going through
some old photos.</i>

04:27.040 --> 04:30.080
<i>Turns out he's an ex fat boy.
Obviously bullied.</i>

04:30.080 --> 04:31.520
<i>Well, you can't say that for sure.</i>

04:31.520 --> 04:34.600
<i>No, no, no. Fat boys are there
to either bully or be bullied.</i>

04:34.600 --> 04:36.360
<i>Sole purpose.
Thank you for that.</i>

04:36.360 --> 04:38.960
<i>And then he's found some exercise
and diet plan -</i>

04:38.960 --> 04:41.480
<i>raw meat, seeds, all that pish -</i>

04:41.480 --> 04:44.520
<i>just about the time the bairns
started to vanish.</i>

04:44.520 --> 04:46.400
<i>What are you saying?
Well, I'm not suggesting</i>

04:46.400 --> 04:48.360
<i>that the diet turned him into
a nonce kidnapper,</i>

04:48.360 --> 04:50.840
<i>but it's just a signifier
that he was getting ready</i>

04:50.840 --> 04:53.200
<i>to wreak his revenge on the world.
Revenge for what?</i>

04:53.200 --> 04:56.240
<i>For being a fat prick.
Fat boys are fat inside.</i>

04:56.240 --> 04:58.680
<i>It doesn't matter
how much coral reef they shed.</i>

04:58.680 --> 05:00.920
<i>And I ken how to hurt fat boys.</i>

05:03.960 --> 05:07.440
<i>We've been going through his laptop,
but so far, there's nothing.</i>

05:07.440 --> 05:09.800
<i>Not even porn sites.
Well, that's concerning.</i>

05:09.800 --> 05:11.720
<i>Sex offenders
are generally unimaginative.</i>

05:11.720 --> 05:13.720
<i>I mean, if he's constructing
his scenarios</i>

05:13.720 --> 05:18.000
<i>from imaginative space, then that's
both novel and it's worrying.</i>

05:18.000 --> 05:21.480
<i>It's not possible
that anyone could do</i>

05:21.480 --> 05:24.320
<i>all that meticulous planning
inside their head, is it?</i>

05:24.320 --> 05:28.680
<i>Of course, the yellow notebooks.
It's in the yellow notebooks,</i>

05:28.680 --> 05:30.240
<i>all the planning. If we find them,</i>

05:30.240 --> 05:33.040
<i>we find out what happened
to all those missing girls.</i>

05:34.360 --> 05:36.120
<i>GARETH:</i> <i>Lovely morning.</i>

05:37.160 --> 05:38.760
<i>Are you feeling better?</i>

05:40.200 --> 05:42.280
<i>I was a little under the weather
yesterday.</i>

05:43.720 --> 05:45.400
<i>That's putting it mildly.</i>

05:46.760 --> 05:50.920
<i>Raymond Lennox,
master of the understatement.</i>

05:50.920 --> 05:52.600
<i>The, erm, planning,</i>

05:52.600 --> 05:56.840
<i>the-the-the dossiers you mentioned,</i>

05:56.840 --> 05:59.080
<i>you've written it all down,
haven't you?</i>

05:59.080 --> 06:00.560
<i>Where are they?</i>

06:01.920 --> 06:04.240
<i>You'll find out soon enough.</i>

06:04.240 --> 06:08.680
<i>But I assure you,
I am very meticulous.</i>

06:10.320 --> 06:13.360
<i>Can you tell us where...?
Sorry, DS Drummond,</i>

06:13.360 --> 06:15.600
<i>but I'm not happy talking to a lass</i>

06:15.600 --> 06:18.160
<i>unless I've got my hands
around her throat.</i>

06:18.160 --> 06:20.600
<i>And then I become more...</i>

06:22.840 --> 06:25.000
<i>..expansive.</i>

06:30.480 --> 06:32.920
<i>DS Drummond
leaving the interview room.</i>

06:38.080 --> 06:40.040
<i>DOOR CLOSES AND LOCKS
Of course.</i>

06:41.360 --> 06:44.360
<i>Are these the kind of games
you played with your ex-wife?</i>

06:51.440 --> 06:54.880
<i>These are obviously the kind of
games you play with your girlfriend.</i>

07:09.240 --> 07:12.560
<i>How are you fixed for some squash?</i>

07:12.560 --> 07:14.640
<i>Tomorrow lunchtime?</i>

07:16.000 --> 07:17.880
<i>I've got a funeral tomorrow.</i>

07:17.880 --> 07:21.160
<i>I'm sorry to hear that.
Anyone close?</i>

07:22.960 --> 07:29.360
<i>Look, I know you and Estelle are -
or rather were - good friends.</i>

07:29.360 --> 07:32.640
<i>You knew we were having,</i>

07:32.640 --> 07:35.520
<i>I suppose you'd call it, an affair.</i>

07:35.520 --> 07:37.320
<i>Ugh!</i>

07:37.320 --> 07:40.720
<i>Yeah, but at least Estelle
had the decency to resign,</i>

07:40.720 --> 07:43.440
<i>which is exactly what you should do!
You are a menace</i>

07:43.440 --> 07:45.320
<i>to every single woman
in this office!</i>

07:45.320 --> 07:47.120
<i>Yeah, that's right.
You're a fucking pish!</i>

07:47.120 --> 07:49.800
<i>Arsehole!
You make our lives a fucking misery!</i>

07:49.800 --> 07:54.120
<i>You see this? This is what happens
when you turn a blind eye.</i>

07:54.120 --> 07:56.400
<i>WOMAN:</i> <i>Well done.
WOMAN:</i> <i>Can't tell you how many times</i>

07:56.400 --> 07:58.160
<i>he's made me uncomfortable.</i>

07:58.160 --> 08:01.840
<i>The ex, Mrs Horsburgh,
is she still around?</i>

08:01.840 --> 08:04.400
<i>Yeah, same house, Headingly.
She was interviewed</i>

08:04.400 --> 08:06.640
<i>as soon as we got word
you'd arrested him.</i>

08:06.640 --> 08:09.400
<i>All mundane stuff, though.
Yeah, no kidding me.</i>

08:09.400 --> 08:11.120
<i>Too many unanswered questions.</i>

08:11.120 --> 08:13.720
<i>Ken, can you fix it
for me to meet her?</i>

08:13.720 --> 08:15.280
<i>Tricky.</i>

08:15.280 --> 08:17.840
<i>Yeah, I'll check her out, Ray.
Thanks.</i>

08:21.080 --> 08:23.240
<i>Amanda! Amanda!</i>

08:23.240 --> 08:26.680
<i>Hey, erm, I was just wondering,
could you ask Ray</i>

08:26.680 --> 08:28.280
<i>if I could come down to Leeds
with you?</i>

08:28.280 --> 08:30.560
<i>I just think it'd be
a really good experience.</i>

08:30.560 --> 08:31.880
<i>Sorry, Peter Inglis is off sick,</i>

08:31.880 --> 08:33.720
<i>so you're gonna have to work with
the IT expert</i>

08:33.720 --> 08:36.360
<i>on Confectioner's laptop.
Oh, OK.</i>

08:36.360 --> 08:37.800
<i>Here she is now. Sophie.</i>

08:37.800 --> 08:40.960
<i>Sophie, Stuart, will look after you.</i>

08:43.600 --> 08:44.800
<i>Won't you?</i>

08:44.800 --> 08:46.720
<i>Yeah.</i>

08:48.320 --> 08:50.240
<i>Hi, Stuart.
Hey.</i>

08:50.240 --> 08:54.080
<i>Erm, yeah, come with me
and we'll get you settled in.</i>

09:07.400 --> 09:09.240
<i>Hiya, Ray.
Ken. How you doing?</i>

09:09.240 --> 09:10.560
<i>I'm all right. And who's this?</i>

09:10.560 --> 09:12.720
<i>DS Drummond. Amanda.
Ken Custer.</i>

09:12.720 --> 09:15.440
<i>Feel free to get all
the last stand jokes out of the way.</i>

09:15.440 --> 09:17.240
<i>Like I said,
she is prepared to meet,</i>

09:17.240 --> 09:21.160
<i>but she ain't too chuffed about it,
so you might have to...</i>

09:21.160 --> 09:24.080
<i>All right, Ken? Hey, how did
your Tinder date go last night?</i>

09:24.080 --> 09:26.840
<i>Er, yeah, it went all right,
as it happens.</i>

09:26.840 --> 09:28.720
<i>Seeing her again on Thursday.</i>

09:28.720 --> 09:33.320
<i>So we have the prospect of a...
Custer-fuck? Yeah?</i>

09:33.320 --> 09:34.760
<i>Battle of Little Bighorn!</i>

09:34.760 --> 09:36.520
<i>THEY LAUGH</i>

09:41.440 --> 09:43.240
<i>I'll do the introductions,</i>

09:43.240 --> 09:45.480
<i>then let you get on with it,
all right?</i>

09:53.480 --> 09:56.480
<i>Erm, I divorced Gareth Horsburgh
years ago.</i>

09:56.480 --> 09:58.360
<i>We're strangers to each other now.</i>

09:58.360 --> 10:01.680
<i>Probably always were.
How was it when you were together?</i>

10:03.520 --> 10:05.800
<i>Er, what do you expect me to say?</i>

10:05.800 --> 10:10.080
<i>He was a boring, OCD civil servant.</i>

10:10.080 --> 10:14.600
<i>There must have been
something about him, in your eyes.</i>

10:16.960 --> 10:20.840
<i>Erm... he wasn't
my previous boyfriend.</i>

10:20.840 --> 10:24.560
<i>He wasn't an impulsive,
unstable drug addict,</i>

10:24.560 --> 10:29.280
<i>so it was just a kind of classic...
rebound scenario.</i>

10:30.320 --> 10:31.800
<i>Did you instigate the split?</i>

10:33.040 --> 10:34.680
<i>Yes.
How was he about it?</i>

10:34.680 --> 10:37.320
<i>He was, erm...</i>

10:40.080 --> 10:45.360
<i>Yeah, he barely batted an eyelid,
actually. It was very humiliating.</i>

10:46.960 --> 10:49.400
<i>He even helped me pack.</i>

10:49.400 --> 10:52.080
<i>What was your sex life like
together?</i>

10:52.080 --> 10:56.040
<i>I have spoken about this before.
We're sorry for the repetition,</i>

10:56.040 --> 10:59.320
<i>but your husband kidnapped
and murdered several, possibly many,</i>

10:59.320 --> 11:00.960
<i>girls and young women.
My ex-husband</i>

11:00.960 --> 11:02.440
<i>of nearly 20 years ago.</i>

11:02.440 --> 11:04.720
<i>Just when the girls
started to go missing.</i>

11:09.480 --> 11:12.840
<i>What kind of sex did he like to have
with you? Describe it.</i>

11:16.560 --> 11:17.920
<i>He l...</i>

11:17.920 --> 11:19.880
<i>He liked it when I was on top.</i>

11:19.880 --> 11:24.200
<i>Really? A man whose prey profile
is younger, vulnerable women,</i>

11:24.200 --> 11:27.800
<i>whose mentality
is stalk and take captive,</i>

11:27.800 --> 11:30.360
<i>voluntarily cedes power to a woman
in that way?</i>

11:31.560 --> 11:33.920
<i>You must be hard as nails.</i>

11:37.040 --> 11:38.560
<i>No.</i>

11:39.920 --> 11:44.000
<i>But he was always...
like he was somewhere else.</i>

11:44.000 --> 11:47.680
<i>So... yeah, very distant.</i>

11:49.360 --> 11:50.800
<i>But you've met him.</i>

11:51.840 --> 11:54.160
<i>Yes. Why?</i>

11:54.160 --> 11:56.480
<i>So you've seen how he looks
at women,</i>

11:56.480 --> 11:58.320
<i>especially the pretty ones.</i>

12:02.200 --> 12:05.320
<i>Did he have any problems
getting it up? A malformation?</i>

12:05.320 --> 12:07.400
<i>Why is this relevant?</i>

12:07.400 --> 12:09.360
<i>How a sex offender
approaches intercourse</i>

12:09.360 --> 12:12.280
<i>can tell us a lot about his crimes
and his motivations.</i>

12:12.280 --> 12:14.760
<i>This information
could become invaluable in court,</i>

12:14.760 --> 12:17.480
<i>but before we even get there,
I need to charge him</i>

12:17.480 --> 12:21.800
<i>with the deaths of what I estimate
to be at least 15 young lasses.</i>

12:23.240 --> 12:24.440
<i>15?</i>

12:24.440 --> 12:27.920
<i>You were admitted to hospital
on November the 3rd 2006,</i>

12:27.920 --> 12:32.640
<i>February 23rd 2007 with injuries
consistent with strangulation -</i>

12:32.640 --> 12:34.520
<i>marks to your neck,
eyelids haemorrhaged.</i>

12:34.520 --> 12:35.560
<i>You said to police then</i>

12:35.560 --> 12:39.200
<i>that he liked to practise
auto-asphyxiation on you.</i>

12:45.600 --> 12:47.920
<i>It was the only way that...</i>

12:48.960 --> 12:52.080
<i>..you know, it would make him hard.</i>

12:58.400 --> 13:02.080
<i>I didn't realise... that he would...</i>

13:24.760 --> 13:26.160
<i>DOOR OPENS</i>

13:30.480 --> 13:32.920
<i>Oh, there was a young guy
hanging around the stair.</i>

13:32.920 --> 13:35.960
<i>I'm off duty, and that's not
my department, but I'll...</i>

13:35.960 --> 13:37.920
<i>He was looking through
your letterbox.</i>

13:37.920 --> 13:41.200
<i>I didn't see much else.
He'd a hat and a hoodie.</i>

13:48.760 --> 13:51.400
<i>Stu, Sophie, what's happening?</i>

13:51.400 --> 13:54.080
<i>Did you find anything on the laptop?
There's nothing on it, Ray.</i>

13:54.080 --> 13:58.640
<i>No notes, no pictures, no indication
that anything's been erased.</i>

13:58.640 --> 14:00.200
<i>Must be a second laptop,</i>

14:00.200 --> 14:02.400
<i>or a den with a PC.</i>

14:02.400 --> 14:04.200
<i>Stu...</i>

<i>'and now, on the very last day

16:52.600 --> 16:55.080
<i>we were playing for the championship
in Dundee.</i>

16:55.080 --> 16:56.920
<i>I mean, all we needed
was to not lose.</i>

16:56.920 --> 17:00.680
<i>In fact, we could even afford
a narrow loss</i>

17:00.680 --> 17:02.320
<i>'and still lift the flag.</i>

17:03.960 --> 17:07.480

<i>Like the...</i>

18:20.320 --> 18:24.040
<i>..crushing of the striking miners
by the British state at Orgreave.</i>

18:24.040 --> 18:25.960
<i>Rangers and Celtic
had been challenged</i>

18:25.960 --> 18:29.400
<i>by Aberdeen and Dundee United,
and now Hearts.</i>

18:29.400 --> 18:32.080
<i>Well, they'd spent
to ensure that never happened again.</i>

18:32.080 --> 18:35.240
<i>The flag was now purely
to be purchased,</i>

18:35.240 --> 18:40.040
<i>with no clubs outside of Glasgow
having the cash to do this.</i>

18:41.320 --> 18:45.680
<i>So it was emblematic of the primacy
of money over everything?</i>

18:45.680 --> 18:47.120
<i>Aye.</i>

18:47.120 --> 18:50.600
<i>The neoliberal order.</i>

18:50.600 --> 18:55.320
<i>Football, music,

18:55.320 --> 18:58.440
<i>All just commodities

18:59.800 --> 19:03.080
<i>And I've been very busy since.</i>

19:14.760 --> 19:19.920

19:22.120 --> 19:24.200
<i>Well, it's my job.</i>

19:25.480 --> 19:30.400
<i>Is it not your job to apprehend
the perpetrators of sex abuse?</i>

19:30.400 --> 19:32.320
<i>Aye.</i>

19:32.320 --> 19:34.120
<i>They aren't the same thing.</i>

19:37.080 --> 19:41.880
<i>Don't get me wrong. I'm not
judging you negatively for caring.</i>

19:45.520 --> 19:47.240
<i>Why do you do your job?</i>

19:51.400 --> 19:53.600
<i>I have boundaries in my role...</i>

37:41.160 --> 37:43.280
<i>Really? Why?</i>

<i>to that grotty fast food place...
Yeah, so what?</i>

38:55.040 --> 38:57.720
<i>Well, it were easy to distract 'em.</i>

<i>Why Britney?
Why did it have to be her?</i>

39:44.440 --> 39:45.960
<i>She was of no consequence.</i>

<i>If it weren't her,

a-a darkness...</i>

about your abuser... hmm?</i>

41:09.480 --> 41:12.360
<i>Don't tell me you don't get
that twinge in your balls</i>

41:12.360 --> 41:15.160
<i>and feel the blood surge
into your cock.</i>
