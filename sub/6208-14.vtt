WEBVTT

00:01.815 --> 00:05.382
Now stretch and focus.

00:05.654 --> 00:08.162
Can you feel the blood
rushing to your brain?

00:08.263 --> 00:10.693
No but I feel my lunch making a move.

00:11.207 --> 00:13.297
This is no fun!

00:13.398 --> 00:16.862
If you don't enjoy yoga,
you don't have to do it.

00:16.863 --> 00:19.077
It's easy for you to say, you're winning.

00:19.078 --> 00:21.575
There is no winning and losing in yoga.

00:21.954 --> 00:23.779
It's different from other sports.

00:23.780 --> 00:27.385
It's more spiritual, and you can't
get hit in the face with a ball.

00:27.716 --> 00:29.755
Now let's move on to a meditation.

00:30.050 --> 00:31.719
Assume the lotus position.

00:33.704 --> 00:35.935
Can we assume I've assumed
the lotus position?

00:36.255 --> 00:37.536
Now let's chant.

00:42.429 --> 00:44.547
Ummm what do we do now?

00:44.448 --> 00:46.611
We empty our minds.

00:46.712 --> 00:48.064
That I can do.

00:48.065 --> 00:52.034
Now release your burdens
and lighten your load.

00:56.760 --> 00:58.178
- Zelda!
- What?

01:01.432 --> 01:03.242
I thought you said this was low impact?

01:07.396 --> 01:11.396

01:30.966 --> 01:33.316
My biosphere! Just what I needed.

01:35.274 --> 01:36.555
What was that?

01:42.372 --> 01:45.000
Hilda. Would you be a love
and check my stocks?

01:45.088 --> 01:46.769
Not me! Not today!

01:46.770 --> 01:49.776
- She's stomping already?
- I don't believe this. Look!

01:49.777 --> 01:50.777
Look!

01:50.778 --> 01:53.181
Whoa! Who's your friend?

01:53.281 --> 01:56.462
- It's her first wart as a witch.
- Oh let me get the camera.

01:56.463 --> 01:57.634
No! It's gross.

01:57.635 --> 01:59.751
How did I get it?
And how can I make it go away?

01:59.752 --> 02:03.793
Usually they're caused by stress.
Just calm down and it'll disappear.

02:03.794 --> 02:05.777
I'm calm. I'm calm.

02:07.494 --> 02:10.082
It's still there! I can see it.
What am I gonna do?

02:10.083 --> 02:12.509
Harvey and I are supposed to give
a report on the rain:forest today but

02:12.510 --> 02:14.357
I am not going to school like this.

02:14.358 --> 02:17.677
You can't skip school because of a wart.
It's part of being a witch.

02:17.678 --> 02:19.486
It happens to all of us.

02:19.487 --> 02:22.505
I once had one on the end
of my nose for a decade.

02:23.129 --> 02:25.483
Actually it wasn't that funny,
I wanted to die.

02:25.675 --> 02:28.200
Just be glad you can cover
yours with a baseball cap.

02:28.701 --> 02:31.426
Orioles? I didn't know you were a baseball fan.

02:31.427 --> 02:33.847
I'm not, I'm a Brady Anderson fan.

02:33.848 --> 02:36.650
He is hot, I love those side:burns.

02:36.651 --> 02:40.135
Yeah, I may be a house pet
but I totally see it.

02:40.136 --> 02:42.524
Now you're all set. Off to school.

02:43.182 --> 02:45.515
I feel like a balding middle:aged man..

02:45.516 --> 02:46.882
only more bitter.

02:47.031 --> 02:48.878
Are you sure I can't just
make it a snow day?

02:48.879 --> 02:49.879
No!

02:49.880 --> 02:52.721
But everything's going wrong.
Look, I even broke my biosphere.

02:52.722 --> 02:53.922
And my magic wont fix it.

02:54.087 --> 02:56.605
Oh I bet it's number seven plastic.

02:57.123 --> 02:59.681
It repells magic and it can't be recycled.

03:00.065 --> 03:00.947
Great!

03:00.948 --> 03:03.020
Great! Great! Great!

03:03.491 --> 03:04.792
That's the spirit.

03:04.793 --> 03:06.448
I was being sarcastic!

03:08.514 --> 03:09.773
So was I.

03:12.326 --> 03:13.517
Oh great!

03:13.715 --> 03:15.878
Great! Great! Great!

03:15.879 --> 03:18.396
Sabrina, I need your help.
I have a burning question.

03:18.397 --> 03:19.773
Now is not a good time, Jenny.

03:19.774 --> 03:22.010
I was supossed to meet Harvey
in the library five minutes ago,

03:22.011 --> 03:23.589
so can we talk about it at lunch?

03:23.590 --> 03:26.379
Sure! I'll just save my
burning question till then.

03:26.907 --> 03:29.308
Oh good morning Sabrina.
Hey you're an Orioles fan.

03:29.309 --> 03:31.416
What? Oh yeah.

03:31.417 --> 03:33.124
Oh love that Brady Anderson.

03:33.125 --> 03:35.208
Bet he hits another fifty homers this year huh?

03:35.209 --> 03:36.409
Wouldn't that be great.

03:36.410 --> 03:37.906
Great! Great! Great!

03:39.304 --> 03:40.831
He's not here. Great!

03:44.832 --> 03:46.405
Where were you? I've been waiting.

03:46.406 --> 03:47.980
Sorry. My bus was late.

03:48.274 --> 03:51.312
Hey cool hat! I didn't know
you liked the Orioles?

03:51.313 --> 03:52.513
I do today.

03:52.514 --> 03:54.711
- Well can I try it on?
- No!

03:54.712 --> 03:56.324
Er okay. Let me show you
what I made for our project.

03:56.325 --> 04:01.790
Now first this biosphere was going to show how
the rain:forest is a perfect, self:suporting ecosystem..

04:01.791 --> 04:03.197
but I dropped it.

04:03.509 --> 04:07.006
So now it shows the devastation
caused by greedy timber companies.

04:08.094 --> 04:09.931
It's just a jar o' dirt.

04:10.230 --> 04:12.242
It's called de:forestation!

04:12.243 --> 04:13.706
Okay! Okay!

04:14.121 --> 04:15.827
Now I have something to show you.

04:16.128 --> 04:17.781
Just what our project needs.

04:18.098 --> 04:21.321
He's the last of the spider monkeys
but you can call him...

04:21.322 --> 04:22.522
Marty.

04:22.701 --> 04:24.069
Hi Sabrina!

04:24.070 --> 04:25.270
A puppet?

04:25.271 --> 04:27.448
See I think our message will be much stronger

04:27.449 --> 04:30.725
if we give the tragedy of
extinction a voice and a name.

04:31.233 --> 04:32.528
Marty?

04:32.529 --> 04:33.645
We can change it.

04:33.646 --> 04:37.254
The point is he lives in the rain:forest,
he has credibility.

04:37.676 --> 04:38.918
Watch.

04:39.916 --> 04:41.803
See my prehensile tail?

04:41.911 --> 04:44.804
It's a feature found only in
new world monkeys.

04:44.916 --> 04:46.553
I'm trying to like it.

04:47.102 --> 04:49.126
I'm making every effort.

04:49.840 --> 04:50.871
I hate it.

04:51.476 --> 04:54.691
But it's a guaranteed 'A'!
Mr. Pool'll eat this up.

04:54.692 --> 04:56.571
We're sticking with the biosphere.

04:56.572 --> 04:58.028
You mean the jar o' dirt.

04:58.029 --> 04:59.877
It's a biosphere!

05:01.227 --> 05:05.498
As you pass the biosphere around I think
you'll see what Sting is so upset about.

05:05.499 --> 05:06.699
It's just a jar of dirt!

05:06.930 --> 05:08.406
That's enough Libby.

05:08.577 --> 05:10.430
Sabrina, please continue with your project.

05:10.431 --> 05:11.985
That is the project.

05:12.086 --> 05:13.742
Huh! What's the point?

05:15.182 --> 05:18.588
Yes! Um what's the point..of the rain:forest?

05:18.901 --> 05:23.369
Well it's:it's home to millions of insects,

05:23.370 --> 05:26.396
plants and animals including the spider monkey.

05:26.397 --> 05:28.491
Did someone say spider monkey?

05:29.114 --> 05:30.335
Who are you?

05:30.336 --> 05:33.538
I'm Marty, the rain:forest spokesmonkey.

05:33.639 --> 05:34.868
Delightful!

05:35.217 --> 05:36.978
Harvey! Put the monkey down.

05:37.902 --> 05:41.666
We begin our story deep in the Amazon..

05:41.667 --> 05:46.375
..So weep not for me, weep
for the fate of the earth.

05:46.965 --> 05:48.296
Isn't that right, Sabrina?

05:49.287 --> 05:51.886
What? Oh er yeah!

05:52.208 --> 05:53.449
What the puppet said.

05:53.966 --> 05:56.225
It was terrific! Very creative.

05:56.226 --> 05:58.467
You:you really brought extinction to life.

05:59.096 --> 06:01.559
Now before class ends,
are there any questions.

06:01.560 --> 06:05.051
Yeah! Are you two free for my little
brothers birthday party?

06:07.041 --> 06:08.973
All right, er read chapter twenty:seven

06:09.074 --> 06:11.923
and how about a big hand for
Harvey and Sabrina huh?

06:15.443 --> 06:18.345
I have never been so
embarrassed in my whole life.

06:18.346 --> 06:21.053
What! Come on, the
monkey saved our butts.

06:21.054 --> 06:23.508
Hey guys, can you tell me how
to get to Sesame Street?

06:23.592 --> 06:25.595
See? Everyone thought it was lame.

06:25.596 --> 06:26.696
Mr. Pool didn't.

06:26.697 --> 06:28.812
Like I care what Mr. Pool thinks!

06:28.813 --> 06:29.813
Sabrina!

06:30.451 --> 06:33.725
Oh great! I need sugar,
I'm going to lunch.

06:34.241 --> 06:35.487
Can I come too?

06:35.488 --> 06:37.150
Look, I just want to eat alone.

06:38.602 --> 06:40.382
I was just trying to cheer her up.

06:43.052 --> 06:44.203
Hi Sabrina.

06:44.840 --> 06:47.578
'The Bell Jar'! Three puddings!

06:47.679 --> 06:49.121
This can't be good.

06:49.423 --> 06:50.242
It's not.

06:50.662 --> 06:51.883
D'you wanna talk about it?

06:51.884 --> 06:53.835
No. Didn't you have a burning question or something?

06:53.836 --> 06:54.923
Oh yeah.

06:54.924 --> 06:58.938
See, lately I've been feeling like
people aren't paying attention to me.

06:58.939 --> 07:00.139
Get a puppet.

07:00.363 --> 07:05.569
No, I wa:I was thinking of cutting my hair
ust to shake things up but it's a big decision.

07:05.570 --> 07:07.096
Or fifty thousand little ones.

07:07.097 --> 07:10.523
I'm serious. Sometimes I feel
like I'm a prisoner of my own curls.

07:10.524 --> 07:13.140
Really? That's fascinating, please go on.

07:13.141 --> 07:15.790
Well, when people se
my hair they think..

07:23.205 --> 07:25.222
- Hey Sabrina.
- Libby, what do you want?

07:25.223 --> 07:28.482
You know, I forgot. There was something
I wanted to ask you about your project.

07:28.483 --> 07:29.483
Yeah?

07:29.484 --> 07:31.978
If the earth's tropical forests
are being wiped out at a rate of

07:31.979 --> 07:35.605
sixty:seven acres a minute then how
come you're wearing that stupid hat?

07:35.606 --> 07:37.814
- Give it back!
- What is that?

07:42.243 --> 07:43.470
Snow day!

07:45.855 --> 07:47.829
Hey wart:face. You forgot your hat.

07:47.830 --> 07:49.438
And you forgot you're a goat!

07:50.529 --> 07:52.001
Now go climb a mountain.

07:56.537 --> 07:58.206
Great! Great! Great!

08:04.388 --> 08:09.764
Hello Sabrina, you stormed in.
O:oh! Is that your blizzard?

08:09.765 --> 08:12.300
Yeah, I blanketed the entire Northeast.

08:12.301 --> 08:15.320
Oh and in local news
I turned Libby into a goat.

08:15.321 --> 08:17.056
Come talk to me.

08:18.229 --> 08:19.507
What's the matter?

08:19.508 --> 08:20.708
What's the matter?

08:20.709 --> 08:22.575
I have to be a witch, I have to be a mortal,

08:22.576 --> 08:25.857
I have to be a teenager and I have to be
a girl all at the same time.

08:25.858 --> 08:27.191
That's what's the matter.

08:27.192 --> 08:29.455
Hey! At least you've still got your thumbs.

08:29.560 --> 08:31.393
And a door on your bathroom!

08:32.356 --> 08:35.433
Hey look! I've found my Brady
Anderson baseball card.

08:35.534 --> 08:37.981
Who cares? Brady Anderson is nothing to me.

08:37.982 --> 08:38.982
Sabrina!

08:39.355 --> 08:40.840
How could you say such a thing?

08:41.155 --> 08:42.318
I'm in a bad mood.

08:42.320 --> 08:44.208
Hey! I know what'll cheer you up.

08:44.310 --> 08:45.310
Flaun.

08:45.383 --> 08:46.446
Flaun.?

08:46.447 --> 08:47.547
The happy dessert.

08:47.548 --> 08:50.530
Everyone loves the custardy goodness
of a wiggly:jiggly flaun.

08:50.531 --> 08:53.014
You can have my share.
I just want to be left alone.

08:54.662 --> 08:55.934
But flaun!

08:57.298 --> 08:59.759
I can't believe this. It looks awful.

09:00.528 --> 09:01.748
It's huge!

09:01.749 --> 09:04.175
If you took it to a movie it would want it's own seat.

09:04.260 --> 09:05.919
At least someone agrees with me.

09:06.201 --> 09:08.058
I'm so sick of people
trying to cheer me up.

09:08.059 --> 09:10.894
I hate when they do that.
You can be in a bad mood if you want.

09:11.118 --> 09:12.434
No:one else thinks so.

09:12.435 --> 09:15.956
Everyone keeps trying to make me feel
better and I just want to be left alone.

09:15.957 --> 09:16.957
You know what I mean?

09:16.958 --> 09:19.238
You could come in here. No:one will disturb you.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.195
- Can I do that?
- Sure.

09:21.196 --> 09:23.014
- Step right through.
- Cool!

09:25.872 --> 09:28.042
Wow! Everything's swapped around.

09:28.143 --> 09:30.473
Okay door. Wrong!

09:30.899 --> 09:31.939
Door!

09:31.940 --> 09:34.496
And my desk is... over there.

09:37.103 --> 09:38.955
neetneveS magazine.

09:39.156 --> 09:41.544
Man I didn't know there was
a whole world through my mirror.

09:41.545 --> 09:44.252
Yeah, it's a great place for quiet reflection.

09:44.618 --> 09:46.246
Good, I need some time to relax.

09:48.083 --> 09:49.570
This is great.

09:52.764 --> 09:54.803
Er maybe I'll just look at the pictures.

09:55.869 --> 09:57.765
- Did you hear that?
- What?

09:57.766 --> 09:59.242
My stomach rumbling.

09:59.998 --> 10:01.235
What's for dinner?

10:01.236 --> 10:03.049
Whatever comes out of
the end of your finger.

10:03.050 --> 10:04.506
I'm too busy working to cook.

10:04.507 --> 10:05.997
Oh I know what I want.

10:06.246 --> 10:07.300
Flaun.

10:08.258 --> 10:09.402
It's so wiggly.

10:09.934 --> 10:12.094
I don't know whether to eat it or attack it.

10:12.095 --> 10:13.974
Oh hey would you do me a favour
and check on Sabrina.

10:13.975 --> 10:15.236
and see what she want's for dinner?

10:15.237 --> 10:16.492
I'm not sticking my head in there.

10:16.493 --> 10:18.710
She's in a bad mood, she might bite it off.

10:18.811 --> 10:20.327
- You go.
- No, you go.

10:20.328 --> 10:21.482
No, you go.

10:21.483 --> 10:23.175
No, Salem will go.

10:23.210 --> 10:24.144
What!

10:25.094 --> 10:27.162
Good idea. Safety in numbers.

10:27.922 --> 10:30.447
Sabrina! It's dinner time!

10:31.145 --> 10:32.605
She must be sleeping.

10:36.133 --> 10:37.162
She's not here.

10:37.163 --> 10:38.363
Where did she go?

10:38.364 --> 10:39.364
I have no idea.

10:39.365 --> 10:41.034
Mayday! The mirror!

10:41.762 --> 10:44.263
Sabrina must have passed
through the looking glass.

10:44.264 --> 10:47.119
Oh:no! She's trapped in her own bad mood!

10:50.905 --> 10:52.412
I don't see Sabrina.

10:52.413 --> 10:54.447
Oh I wish we could make these clouds lift.

10:54.448 --> 10:55.959
There's nothing we can do.

10:55.960 --> 10:58.216
Only she can get herself out of a bad mood.

10:58.429 --> 11:00.066
I hope it doesn't take too long.

11:00.067 --> 11:02.339
Oh, and I hope our counterparts
aren't too rotten.

11:02.340 --> 11:04.198
- Me too.
- Well let's go.

11:04.199 --> 11:06.476
Remember that time I got stuck
in my own resentment

11:06.477 --> 11:08.543
and you didn't lift one finger to help me.

11:08.544 --> 11:09.991
At least you got over it.

11:10.847 --> 11:12.031
No I didn't.

11:19.623 --> 11:20.927
Seven A.M.?

11:22.954 --> 11:24.565
I must have slept straight through.

11:30.945 --> 11:33.156
Hey! My wart is gone.

11:33.157 --> 11:34.357
ou must have calmed down.

11:34.358 --> 11:37.715
I feel so much better...
but I look like a mess.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.833
There. Well thanks for everything.
I'd better get home and go to school.

11:44.584 --> 11:47.185
Hey! What's going on?

11:47.186 --> 11:50.271
You're stuck. Remember
you wanted to be left alone.

11:51.789 --> 11:52.815
Oh:no!

11:53.878 --> 11:56.718
Help me! Someone help me!

11:56.719 --> 11:57.919
I got it! I got it!

11:58.020 --> 12:00.222
- Who are you?
- I'm Brady Anderson.

12:00.223 --> 12:02.675
The baseball player? You've come to help me?

12:02.676 --> 12:05.074
I'm thinking about it but I'm not sure.

12:05.834 --> 12:07.703
I mean you did say I was nothing to you.

12:07.704 --> 12:11.074
I didn't mean it. I was in a bad mood.
Everyone was bugging me.

12:11.075 --> 12:13.165
Well if everyone was bugging you

12:13.166 --> 12:15.964
did you consider that maybe the problem
wasn't with the rest of the world?

12:15.965 --> 12:17.440
That maybe it was with you?

12:17.856 --> 12:18.870
No.

12:18.871 --> 12:22.886
I mean the things that happened weren't my fault
and I was under a lot of stress.

12:23.213 --> 12:24.651
Yeah I know about stress.

12:24.652 --> 12:27.337
Yankee Stadium, play:offs,
twenty million viewers

12:27.338 --> 12:30.157
High school, science project,
very big wart.

12:30.451 --> 12:33.162
Okay you win,
but only because of the very big wart.

12:33.343 --> 12:36.139
My point is we all live with stress.

12:36.140 --> 12:39.781
That's why you have to control your emotions
and not let your emotions control you.

12:40.365 --> 12:42.452
Isn't that a lot to ask from a teenager?

12:42.453 --> 12:46.255
Yeah and it'll take you about
twenty years to get good at it

12:46.256 --> 12:48.065
but you should start now.
I mean if you wanna get home.

12:48.066 --> 12:49.740
I do. I don't like it here.

12:49.741 --> 12:51.745
I mean for one thing I'm right handed.

12:52.117 --> 12:54.095
I'm a lefty myself. I fit in fine.

12:54.466 --> 12:57.239
Okay, the first thing you have
to do is make amends.

12:57.240 --> 12:59.302
Easy. I'll just tell everyone I'm sorry.

12:59.403 --> 13:01.790
Oh and I'll turn Libby back from a goat.

13:01.891 --> 13:03.370
Good you've got a game:plan.

13:03.371 --> 13:04.828
But I'm locked in.

13:05.129 --> 13:06.332
Here ya go.

13:06.333 --> 13:08.733
- How'd you do that?
- I choked up on the knob.

13:12.734 --> 13:13.771
Good Morning.

13:13.772 --> 13:15.838
Do you mind! I'm working on an article.

13:15.839 --> 13:18.095
Sorry. I just wanted to get some breakfast.

13:18.096 --> 13:20.556
- There, have some porridge.
- Thanks.

13:21.116 --> 13:22.929
Ugh! It's cold!

13:22.930 --> 13:25.444
I'm sorry Goldilocks, the kitchen is closed.

13:25.445 --> 13:28.216
Okay. I'll just go look for the others.

13:29.987 --> 13:32.179
Good morning Salem. Checking your stocks?

13:32.180 --> 13:33.878
Yes and they're all down.

13:33.879 --> 13:35.612
Down! Down! Down!

13:35.613 --> 13:38.153
Well you know what goes down must come up.

13:38.154 --> 13:40.170
Thank you Louis Rookiezer.

13:40.171 --> 13:43.091
But if my stocks don't rally
I'll have to go back to dry food.

13:43.092 --> 13:45.859
Now please, I'd like some privacy.

13:45.960 --> 13:47.610
Oh great.

13:47.711 --> 13:49.111
Great! Great! Great!

13:51.889 --> 13:53.863
- Aunt Hilda?
- What do you want?

13:53.864 --> 13:55.690
I'm a little under the weather.

13:56.125 --> 13:57.903
Er maybe I'll come back later.

13:57.904 --> 14:00.763
Hey good news!
The living room drought is over.

14:09.931 --> 14:11.587
Sabrina! I need to talk to you.

14:11.588 --> 14:14.831
Good 'cause I know you wanted
to talk yesterday and now I'm all ears.

14:15.124 --> 14:16.319
So am I.

14:16.629 --> 14:17.886
What happened to your hair?

14:17.887 --> 14:19.676
It's gone! And it's all your fault.

14:19.677 --> 14:22.073
So I wanted to talk to you
and say I'm not talking to you.

14:22.174 --> 14:23.952
Wait! How is it my fault?

14:23.953 --> 14:26.021
As my friend you shouldn't
have let me do this.

14:26.022 --> 14:29.927
I'm sorry. I was in a bad mood yesterday
and I wasn't really listening.

14:29.928 --> 14:31.228
My life is over.

14:31.329 --> 14:33.576
Jenny, what you need
is some perspective, okay?

14:33.577 --> 14:36.387
First of all, it looks good. No,
It looks better than good.

14:36.388 --> 14:41.462
It looks... fine, and second, it's gonna grow out.

14:41.694 --> 14:44.937
That's right! I forgot. Hair grows.

14:44.938 --> 14:47.225
Yeah. Now just keep saying that
and you'll feel better.

14:47.226 --> 14:50.158
Hair grows. Hair grows.

14:50.159 --> 14:52.608
Now I've gotta go find Harvey.
You wanna have lunch?

14:52.909 --> 14:53.909
Okay.

14:53.910 --> 14:54.910
Good!

14:56.262 --> 14:58.167
- Hair grows.
- Hair grows.

15:01.550 --> 15:02.565
Hey Harvey.

15:02.566 --> 15:05.216
- Sabrina no! Stay back!
- What's wrong?

15:05.217 --> 15:07.807
You shouldn't be seen with me. No:one should.

15:08.008 --> 15:11.012
Not after how I embarrassed
us both in biology.

15:11.113 --> 15:12.811
You mean with Marty the monkey?

15:12.812 --> 15:15.408
Don't even say that name.
I'm trying to forget.

15:15.409 --> 15:16.609
But he was cute.

15:16.610 --> 15:18.627
He was lame. You even said so.

15:18.628 --> 15:21.688
Because I was in a bad mood.
But today I love puppets.

15:21.689 --> 15:23.055
Where is the little guy?

15:23.497 --> 15:26.171
We had a fight. He's over there on the floor.

15:26.782 --> 15:29.088
Oh:no! Marty?

15:29.089 --> 15:30.305
Are you okay?

15:30.731 --> 15:33.966
I'm fine. But I'm worried
about my friend, Harvey.

15:34.661 --> 15:36.478
Well let's go see if we can cheer him up.

15:37.322 --> 15:38.392
Hey Harvey.

15:39.024 --> 15:40.069
What Marty?

15:40.070 --> 15:42.346
Sabrina's sorry. Very sorry,

15:42.347 --> 15:44.433
and she thanks you for saving her butt.

15:44.974 --> 15:46.855
Y'know, he is kinda cute.

15:47.255 --> 15:48.953
And he's the reason we got an 'A'

15:48.954 --> 15:52.033
Well when you put it that way
I feel kinda bad that I ripped his eyes out.

15:52.134 --> 15:53.744
Hey, Marty's used to tragedy

15:53.845 --> 15:56.725
Hey! That's my homework!
You're eating my homework!

15:56.726 --> 15:57.726
Libby?

16:04.948 --> 16:05.968
Okay,

16:05.969 --> 16:09.650
Libby, I may not be able to stomach
saying this to you after I undo the spell so..

16:09.651 --> 16:12.502
I'm sorry. I was in a bad mood yesterday

16:12.503 --> 16:15.157
but that's no excuse for
turning you into a goat.

16:15.158 --> 16:16.961
Even though you totally deserved it.

16:18.078 --> 16:19.551
Then we understand each other?

16:21.649 --> 16:23.527
What am I doing in the girls room?

16:23.528 --> 16:25.391
You were going to wash your hands.

16:25.392 --> 16:26.392
I was?

16:31.268 --> 16:34.363
So I was just wondering.
Is everything cool between us?

16:34.364 --> 16:36.637
It never was, freak.

16:36.925 --> 16:38.959
Good to have you back Libby. Gotta go.

16:51.081 --> 16:52.153
Ah, I'm up.

16:52.254 --> 16:54.051
Brady? You're at my school.

16:54.052 --> 16:55.616
How do you have time to follow me around?

16:55.617 --> 16:58.399
I'm your spirit guide. And it's the off season.

16:58.400 --> 17:01.086
Well I think you should know I've
been making amends left and right.

17:01.087 --> 17:02.884
I mean right and left.

17:03.322 --> 17:05.987
Well anyway, Jenny,
Harvey and Libby are all fine.

17:05.988 --> 17:07.505
Afraid that's not enough.

17:07.506 --> 17:09.569
You see your bad mood had a ripple effect.

17:09.570 --> 17:11.356
It spread further than you think.

17:11.357 --> 17:12.571
Like to Guam?

17:12.573 --> 17:14.669
No, but beyond those three.

17:15.010 --> 17:19.508
Frankly you have to cheer up the whole school.
Including Mr. Pool.

17:19.509 --> 17:21.108
What happened to Mr. Pool?

17:21.487 --> 17:22.910
You might wanna check.

17:24.237 --> 17:25.340
Mr. Pool?

17:25.854 --> 17:27.625
- Is it morning?
- Yeah.

17:27.626 --> 17:30.098
- I survived.
- Survived what?

17:30.199 --> 17:33.742
My car wouldn't start because
of the blizzard so I got stuck here,

17:33.743 --> 17:36.173
and guess what?
They turn off the heat at six!

17:36.174 --> 17:37.174
That's terrible.

17:37.075 --> 17:39.623
What's worse was that I kept hallucinating

17:39.624 --> 17:41.640
that there was a goat
running around the school.

17:42.148 --> 17:45.516
I know it sounds weird But,
The Goat's very snotty

17:45.717 --> 17:48.805
Forget about your horrible... twisted dream.

17:49.791 --> 17:51.388
I know something that'll cheer you up.

17:51.389 --> 17:53.022
Oh Sabrina, trust me.

17:53.023 --> 17:56.303
Nothing could make...
Brady Anderson! Whoa, I don't believe it!

17:56.304 --> 17:58.465
Wow, I'm your biggest fan!
What are you doing here?

17:58.566 --> 18:01.565
I'm in town for some er motivational speaking.

18:01.566 --> 18:03.236
- To what group?
- Sabrina.

18:03.237 --> 18:04.794
Oh! Would you sign my brain?

18:04.795 --> 18:05.795
Sure.

18:05.796 --> 18:07.644
Look, I need to go.
There's something I need to do.

18:09.121 --> 18:10.392
Which Hemisphere?

18:10.393 --> 18:12.674
Er. Just right along the cerebellum is fine.

18:14.687 --> 18:17.765
You look different.
Are those new ear:rings?

18:17.866 --> 18:18.966
Actually they are.

18:19.167 --> 18:21.168
People tell me I'm not perceptive.

18:21.169 --> 18:24.142
Attention students. This is Sabrina Spellman.

18:24.143 --> 18:26.973
I'd like you all to know
I was in a bad mood yesterday

18:26.974 --> 18:28.791
and I just wanna say I'm sorry.

18:28.792 --> 18:31.277
And to make it up to you
I have a surprise in the cafeteria.

18:31.278 --> 18:33.861
So if you'll please proceed in an orderly fashion..

18:39.215 --> 18:40.681
It's beautiful!

18:40.882 --> 18:42.883
I've never seen anything like it.

18:42.884 --> 18:45.451
 It's flaun, and there's enough for everyone.

19:11.413 --> 19:13.349
Here Libby, have some flaun.

19:13.650 --> 19:15.265
No thanks. I'm not hungry.

19:28.423 --> 19:30.382
Alright. Party time!

19:30.383 --> 19:31.851
Oh Sabrina I'm working.

19:31.852 --> 19:35.867
Okay then I'll just put this flaun down over here.

19:35.868 --> 19:40.784
Flaun! I haven't taken a break in six hours,
but I will for flaun.

19:40.785 --> 19:42.185
Did someone say flaun?

19:42.186 --> 19:43.798
I could go for some flaun! 

19:43.799 --> 19:46.161
Never underestimate the power of flaun.

19:48.199 --> 19:49.764
I'm going home!

19:50.498 --> 19:52.879
Aw! Solid contact!

19:53.094 --> 19:54.180
Brady?

19:54.495 --> 19:57.428
I came to say goodbye.
I'm really glad it all worked out.

19:57.429 --> 19:58.508
Thanks.

19:58.509 --> 20:01.525
I couldn't have done it without you.
You really put things in perspective.

20:01.526 --> 20:03.721
That's the key.
Now get back to the real world,

20:03.822 --> 20:06.349
 and remember, life is a team sport. 

20:08.940 --> 20:10.706
Life is a team sport?

20:11.007 --> 20:12.817
How stupid does that sound?

20:16.756 --> 20:17.935
I'm home!

20:18.134 --> 20:20.012
You got out of your bad mood!

20:20.013 --> 20:21.013
Good girl.

20:21.014 --> 20:23.089
- What did you bring me?
- A big kiss.

20:23.190 --> 20:25.845
Hey! Hey! I can groom myself.

20:26.688 --> 20:28.839
I'm sorry I made such a mess of everything.

20:28.840 --> 20:30.040
 We cleaned it up.

20:30.041 --> 20:33.051
We even kept the blizzard going
so all your friends could have a snow day.

20:33.052 --> 20:35.375
And we changed Libby
back from being a goat,

20:35.376 --> 20:38.780
but not before taking a Polaroid
so you could treasure the memory for ever.

20:40.251 --> 20:42.181
So the real world kept going without me?

20:43.423 --> 20:44.442
Teenagers!

20:44.443 --> 20:45.873
Then there's a call I have to make.

20:45.874 --> 20:49.526
Well you don't have to order me
a pizza but make it half sausage, half clams.

20:50.844 --> 20:52.924
Hello Jenny? Did you cut your hair?

20:53.717 --> 20:56.999
No? Good, don't. It'd be
the biggest mistake of your life..

20:57.410 --> 20:59.140
No, a trim would be fine.

20:59.141 --> 21:02.557
Look I'll call you later and we'll
discuss every hair. Okay. Bye.

21:04.143 --> 21:05.586
 I'm in such a good mood.

21:05.587 --> 21:07.249
Well then we should celebrate.

21:07.250 --> 21:10.524
And there's no better way to celebrate
than with a woggly joggly flaun.

21:11.901 --> 21:12.980
This is great.

21:12.981 --> 21:14.616
Great! Great! Great!

21:16.630 --> 21:18.890
I was being sincere.

21:42.419 --> 21:45.300
Enough! I'm not going to
stand here all day watching you

21:45.814 --> 21:48.882
Wait! Come back!
Which sweater did you like?

21:50.357 --> 21:53.235
Hey, how am I supposed to figure
this out without you?
