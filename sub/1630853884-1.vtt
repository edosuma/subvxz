01:22.750 --> 01:23.551
- It looks like
while it was painted,

01:23.585 --> 01:25.252
it was, like,
painted off of instinct,

01:25.285 --> 01:26.486
you know?
- Mm-hm.

01:26.521 --> 01:28.388
-I think that's kinda what the
artist is trying to say here --

01:28.422 --> 01:30.257
like...

01:30.290 --> 01:33.260
this struggle is very
instinctual and, like...

01:33.293 --> 01:35.797
just, like, her
brushstrokes, you know?

01:37.765 --> 01:39.466
I just know it's
aesthetically pleasing.

01:39.499 --> 01:41.736
Like, I like looking at this...

01:41.769 --> 01:43.571
at this thing, you know?

02:46.400 --> 02:47.502
- It looks
like while it was painted,

02:47.535 --> 02:49.336
it was, like,
painted off of instinct,

02:49.369 --> 02:50.538
you know?
- Mm-hm.

02:50.571 --> 02:51.238
- I think
that's kinda what the artist is

02:51.271 --> 02:53.407
trying to say here -- like...

02:54.274 --> 02:56.376
this struggle is very
instinctual and, like--

03:24.539 --> 03:26.841
- Recording a
podcast is easy if you have the

03:26.874 --> 03:28.408
right equipment.

03:28.442 --> 03:30.243
You're going to
need a microphone,

03:30.277 --> 03:34.381
a recording device, and a place
to upload your file so it's easy

03:34.414 --> 03:35.516
to share.

03:35.550 --> 03:37.384
Let's record something!

03:40.420 --> 03:42.355
- The scene has a
tendency of shifting from day to

03:42.389 --> 03:43.356
day.

03:48.896 --> 03:51.498
And I suppose that's the
purpose of my podcast.

03:55.703 --> 03:58.840
I've always had an
interest in collecting sound --

03:58.873 --> 04:01.374
conversations...

04:01.408 --> 04:03.878
ambience...

04:03.911 --> 04:06.313
I have thousands of recordings.

04:08.583 --> 04:12.285
I usually will record digital,
then I re-record analog because

04:12.319 --> 04:14.756
analog just sounds better.

04:17.658 --> 04:21.963
My process may seem weird, but
I embrace the unconventional.

04:29.504 --> 04:32.907
For my podcast, I'll be
following underground musicians

04:32.940 --> 04:36.043
-- bands that you've
probably never heard of.

04:37.812 --> 04:42.083
I find the best way to discover
new music is at a record store,

04:42.116 --> 04:45.452
tucked away, hidden from shallow
people who don't appreciate good

04:45.485 --> 04:46.921
music.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.808
These groups can be a
bit elusive at times,

05:06.841 --> 05:10.845
nonconformists, playing
unmarketed shows in spotty

05:10.878 --> 05:14.015
basements and seedy venues.

05:15.683 --> 05:19.821
When I'm at these shows, I
see how music connects people.

05:19.854 --> 05:22.757
I see these artists onstage,
and they have something that I

05:22.790 --> 05:26.594
don't: a certain kind of
tenacity that almost feels

05:26.627 --> 05:28.629
superhuman.

05:30.031 --> 05:33.400
For this podcast, I hope to
investigate these artists,

05:33.433 --> 05:35.402
research them.

05:37.738 --> 05:42.543
Tune in each week for exclusive
interviews and performances...

05:42.577 --> 05:45.345
with some of the best
undergrou--

05:47.081 --> 05:49.684
With some of the best
underground musicians in the

05:49.717 --> 05:51.484
city.

05:51.519 --> 05:53.486
My name is Lennon Gates.

06:04.198 --> 06:08.035
Do you mind if I
interview you for my podcast?

06:09.704 --> 06:11.906
-No, I'm good.

06:55.116 --> 06:56.918
- Make yourself at home.

06:56.951 --> 06:58.719
Want any tea?

06:58.753 --> 07:00.621
- No, thank you.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.804
So, um...

07:16.837 --> 07:18.606
I'm Lennon.

07:18.639 --> 07:21.709
My podcast is
basically just, like...

07:21.742 --> 07:25.079
about the local music
scene, and I, like,

07:25.112 --> 07:28.616
interview
underground musicians, um...

07:28.649 --> 07:31.619
so I guess, basically, I'm just
gonna ask you some questions

07:31.652 --> 07:34.989
about music and
art and yourselves.

07:35.022 --> 07:37.625
-I think that comes across a
lot more in some of the current

07:37.658 --> 07:39.260
material that we're
working on right now.

07:39.293 --> 07:41.595
Um, we're in the process of
completing a full-length album.

07:41.629 --> 07:43.664
-Mm, 'Oscillations.'
-'Oscillations.'

07:43.698 --> 07:47.635
It was this past
summer, it was record heat,

07:47.668 --> 07:52.006
and I made my way over to
the creek in our backyard,

07:52.039 --> 07:53.274
and...

07:53.307 --> 07:58.179
I just spent hours watching the
water flow through the rocks...

08:00.581 --> 08:03.150
and I remember having this...

08:03.184 --> 08:06.620
profound realization that...

08:06.654 --> 08:09.290
us -- and
everything around us--

08:09.323 --> 08:10.424
-Mm.

08:10.458 --> 08:15.162
-Are composed of atoms
oscillating in and around us.

08:15.196 --> 08:17.631
- Mm-hm, yes.
- Yeah.

08:17.665 --> 08:19.300
Mm-hm.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.669
So that's slated for
fall of 2026 release,

08:21.702 --> 08:23.671
so we're excited about that.

08:33.014 --> 08:35.850
-Have you guys been
on a podcast before?

08:49.997 --> 08:52.800
-Can you describe your genre?

08:52.833 --> 08:54.635
-Queer death pop.

08:54.668 --> 08:57.004
- Experimental indie?
- Experimental pop?

08:57.038 --> 08:58.672
-I think we call
ourselves "indie folk."

08:58.706 --> 09:00.207
-I guess I'd just
be "Alternative."

09:00.241 --> 09:02.009
- Uh, I'm
in a-- I'm in a duo;

09:02.043 --> 09:04.011
we don't really
identify as "a band."

09:04.045 --> 09:06.680
That would seem like kind of a
weird thing to call ourselves.

09:06.714 --> 09:11.719
-Our genre is "junkyard
bop" or "family band"...

09:12.053 --> 09:14.722
um, like if your
really strange relative,

09:14.755 --> 09:16.624
uh, was a band.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.563
-My art is super...

09:23.064 --> 09:25.166
super colorful and super fun.
- Mm-hm.

09:25.199 --> 09:28.002
- Been the
proverbial door to my...

09:28.035 --> 09:30.337
self-indignation.

09:31.205 --> 09:33.207
Instead of you...

09:33.240 --> 09:35.743
I...belong here.

10:02.436 --> 10:03.771
All right,
here's another new one.

10:03.804 --> 10:06.107
This one's unreleased.

10:12.079 --> 10:15.749
-I've been trying to push myself
outside of my comfort zone more.

10:18.919 --> 10:21.822
-Is, uh, that why we came here?

10:22.289 --> 10:25.860
-I saw Jen Tsang post about it.

10:25.893 --> 10:27.795
-Who's Jen Tsang?

10:28.162 --> 10:30.965
-I've been wanting to tell you.

10:32.032 --> 10:34.768
I've been booking
more interviews lately,

10:34.802 --> 10:37.304
so I probably won't be able to
see you as much in the next few

10:37.338 --> 10:39.140
months.

10:39.740 --> 10:42.743
-I mean, we don't really see
much of each other anyway.

10:46.046 --> 10:47.314
-How's Mom?

10:47.348 --> 10:49.683
-I don't know, why
don't you call her?

10:49.717 --> 10:51.785
-Why doesn't she call me?

10:53.120 --> 10:55.322
-Who's Jen Tsang?

10:55.356 --> 10:58.125
-She's a
politically-driven musician.

11:02.897 --> 11:04.798
-Isn't that like a
tea or something?

11:04.832 --> 11:07.968
-No, she's a
politically-driven musician.

11:08.002 --> 11:10.804
-Are you still
working at Philip Arthur's?

11:10.838 --> 11:12.406
-Yeah.

11:12.873 --> 11:15.743
But I haven't been
taking as many hours.

11:15.776 --> 11:18.679
-Does Mike still work
at Philip Arthur's?

11:19.914 --> 11:21.882
-I've been looking
for a new apartment.

11:21.916 --> 11:23.717
-Where?

11:23.751 --> 11:25.853
-I don't know.

11:25.886 --> 11:28.856
I want more space
to be creative.

11:29.423 --> 11:33.827
And, like, where the bedroom is
the same room as the kitchen.

11:33.861 --> 11:36.197
-So like a studio apartment?

11:36.230 --> 11:38.999
-Yeah, like a studio apartment.

11:39.033 --> 11:40.502
- Can I get you
guys another drink?

11:40.535 --> 11:41.835
-Um, no, thanks,
we'll take the check,

11:41.869 --> 11:43.837
and you can put
both of them on mine.

11:43.871 --> 11:46.407
- Got it.
- Thanks.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.176
-Can I try yours?

11:49.210 --> 11:51.412
-Sure, whatever.

11:52.913 --> 11:54.516
You know, when I used to
work at Philip Arthur's,

11:54.549 --> 11:56.884
we literally only had eight
people on the whole staff,

11:56.917 --> 11:58.520
and we did one
event every weekend.

11:58.553 --> 12:01.422
Now, he's, like, running
every event for the whole

12:01.455 --> 12:03.023
frickin' town.

12:10.965 --> 12:13.400
Stretch his sleeves...

12:13.434 --> 12:16.337
that were never
meant to be long...

12:16.370 --> 12:20.542
asking myself, "Do
good people do this?

12:20.575 --> 12:22.876
And am I one?"

12:22.910 --> 12:27.781
So we try again, and
again fade to black...

12:27.815 --> 12:29.383
with lust...

12:29.416 --> 12:31.218
maybe lost...

12:31.252 --> 12:33.555
maybe needing more time...

12:33.588 --> 12:36.957
remembering the sticky things...

12:36.991 --> 12:38.792
mostly...

12:38.826 --> 12:41.862
how sweet our
tongues used to be.

12:50.938 --> 12:53.107
-Thanks for
letting me record that.

12:53.140 --> 12:56.277
- I've never
been on a podcast before.

12:57.278 --> 13:00.582
-As a producer, I go
for a real lo-fi sound.

13:00.615 --> 13:05.085
I strive to capture honesty
in the musicians I record.

13:06.954 --> 13:09.790
I'm a songwriter, too.

13:11.025 --> 13:12.226
-Dope.

13:12.259 --> 13:14.995
-I've been looking for ways
to break into the music scene.

13:15.029 --> 13:18.465
I don't really perform, though.

13:19.933 --> 13:23.003
I just have, like,
notebooks filled with lyrics.

13:23.538 --> 13:26.006
-You have anything I can read?

13:26.040 --> 13:29.043
-Yeah, I have a
few songs written.

13:34.148 --> 13:36.850
This is my journal.

13:41.989 --> 13:44.925
- "You'll be the one
I lament when I've grown...

13:44.958 --> 13:48.362
and I long to forget
everything that I've known.

13:48.395 --> 13:52.199
But I've still got
miles and miles to go."

13:53.033 --> 13:55.002
This stuff is good.

13:55.035 --> 13:57.938
-I have a lot of
other songs, too.

13:58.405 --> 14:01.041
Um, I gotta go.

14:01.075 --> 14:03.010
Thanks.

14:28.202 --> 14:30.204
So we try again...

14:30.237 --> 14:33.941
and again fade to black...

14:33.974 --> 14:35.042
with lust...

14:35.075 --> 14:35.810
"With lust..."

14:35.844 --> 14:37.545
- Maybe lost...

14:37.579 --> 14:40.347
maybe needing more time.
- "Time..."

14:40.381 --> 14:43.384
Remembering the sticky things...

14:43.417 --> 14:45.018
mostly...

14:45.052 --> 14:46.220
how sweet our
tongues used to be.

14:46.253 --> 14:49.056
- "How
sweet our tongues used to be."

15:13.748 --> 15:16.283
Four years ago, the Tack
Gallery was shut down.

15:19.119 --> 15:21.589
The space was originally
used as a meat factory,

15:21.623 --> 15:24.425
but after the building closed,
bands began using the empty

15:24.458 --> 15:26.226
rooms to play shows.

15:31.633 --> 15:35.102
In the spring of 2016, an
underaged kid named Danny Brooks

15:35.135 --> 15:36.571
got drunk at a show.

15:36.604 --> 15:39.139
He stumbled outside and fell
asleep on the railroad tracks,

15:39.173 --> 15:41.041
which ran behind the building.

15:43.645 --> 15:47.080
The owner and older man named
Ed Flock was forced to close the

15:47.114 --> 15:51.418
space after Danny Brooks' body
was fatally run over by a train.

15:56.190 --> 15:59.426
Shortly after, Ed was
arrested for tax evasion.

15:59.460 --> 16:01.161
The city took
control of the space,

16:01.195 --> 16:04.465
and the factory remained empty
and unused for three years,

16:04.498 --> 16:08.636
until Ed's nephew, Randy
Flock, gained ownership.

16:09.203 --> 16:12.640
Next Friday, the Tack Gallery
will open its doors once again

16:12.674 --> 16:16.009
for a secret show at 9PM.

16:16.210 --> 16:17.311
I'll see you all there.

18:44.626 --> 18:46.761
- Damn the Witch
Siren is a witch-rock music

18:46.794 --> 18:49.597
group founded by
Bobbi Kitten and Z-Wolf.

18:49.631 --> 18:53.166
Bobbi Kitten's sultry prowess as
a frontwoman puts Damn the Witch

18:53.200 --> 18:56.804
Siren as one of the most popular
music groups in the scene.

18:58.372 --> 19:01.208
Accompanying Bobbi
is her partner Z-Wolf,

19:01.241 --> 19:03.678
a mysterious musician
who's only ever seen wearing his

19:03.711 --> 19:05.479
wolf mask.

19:05.713 --> 19:08.448
In February, they released
their full-length album,

19:08.482 --> 19:10.283
'Red Magic.'

19:10.317 --> 19:12.252
It's a concept
album about Feminism,

19:12.285 --> 19:16.824
sex, lust, love, setting
fire to the Patriarchy,

19:16.858 --> 19:19.661
and Bobbi's journey of
self-discovery and owning her

19:19.694 --> 19:21.461
sexuality.

23:39.086 --> 23:40.621
-Wait.
-I think it's...

23:40.655 --> 23:42.056
I think we should
start from the beginning.

24:38.980 --> 24:41.816
-Do you like music?

24:42.650 --> 24:46.020
-Yeah, I like music.

24:49.690 --> 24:51.959
-Me too.

24:56.998 --> 24:59.600
You want a chip?

25:00.001 --> 25:02.036
-Sure.

25:03.004 --> 25:05.506
-So last week...

25:06.707 --> 25:08.676
I realized my favorite chip...

25:08.709 --> 25:12.146
is the folded-over chip.

25:12.179 --> 25:16.150
It's just two chips
stacked on top of each other.

25:16.183 --> 25:19.987
I could have my
favorite chip in every bite...

25:20.021 --> 25:24.158
if I just put two chips
on top of each other...

25:24.191 --> 25:27.028
and ate 'em at once.

25:28.162 --> 25:31.132
But here's the thing:

25:31.165 --> 25:35.336
two chips on top of each other
doesn't taste like a folded-over

25:35.369 --> 25:37.171
chip.

25:38.773 --> 25:41.275
- It's
nowhere near as good.

25:43.377 --> 25:46.747
Maybe the flavor
gets stuck between 'em.

26:00.061 --> 26:02.196
- The Old North
District is where most artists

26:02.229 --> 26:04.698
and musicians in the city live.

26:04.732 --> 26:06.100
Rent is cheap.

26:06.133 --> 26:09.036
It's north of campus,
away from the bros.

26:09.070 --> 26:12.173
You'll find the true artist
inconspicuously planted along

26:12.206 --> 26:14.041
Hudson Avenue.

26:14.375 --> 26:17.711
In the 14th century, the great
minds of the time gathered in

26:17.745 --> 26:22.750
Florence, sharing
music, poetry, fashion.

26:23.084 --> 26:25.086
-Hell yeah.

26:25.653 --> 26:28.055
- Old North
is like modern Florence;

26:28.089 --> 26:30.758
the scene here is
small and concentrated,

26:30.791 --> 26:35.396
circles constantly intersecting,
musicians and artists mingling

26:35.429 --> 26:37.231
and collaborating.

26:37.264 --> 26:40.267
It isn't difficult at all for
one artist to cross paths with

26:40.301 --> 26:41.936
another.

27:10.798 --> 27:12.800
-Excuse me.

27:14.335 --> 27:17.104
Hi, I'm Lennon.

27:17.138 --> 27:19.340
-I'm Bobbi.

27:20.841 --> 27:21.842
-We're heading upstairs.

27:21.876 --> 27:22.943
Wanna come?

27:22.977 --> 27:25.112
-Yeah, I do.

27:25.146 --> 27:26.947
Yo, this is, um...

27:26.981 --> 27:27.815
Lennon?

27:27.848 --> 27:29.783
-Oh, yo!

27:29.817 --> 27:31.719
Yeah, we did that podcast.

27:31.752 --> 27:32.920
-Yeah, hey.

27:32.953 --> 27:35.256
-We're heading upstairs to
go smoke and read some poems.

27:35.289 --> 27:37.124
You wanna come?

27:37.158 --> 27:39.093
-Sure.

29:17.992 --> 29:20.227
-That's good shit, Micah.

29:20.261 --> 29:21.929
-Thanks.

29:24.965 --> 29:26.800
Yo.

29:26.834 --> 29:29.436
I never got a chance to
hear that recording you did.

29:29.470 --> 29:31.238
Can you send it to me?

29:31.272 --> 29:33.107
-Oh, for sure.

29:33.140 --> 29:37.144
-You guys have to listen
to some of Lennon's lyrics.

29:37.177 --> 29:39.346
They're incredible.

29:39.947 --> 29:42.049
-You write?

29:42.082 --> 29:43.551
-Um...

29:43.585 --> 29:46.053
a bit, but I
don't really perform.

29:46.086 --> 29:48.789
-Come on.

29:49.123 --> 29:51.325
-I mean...

29:53.027 --> 29:55.296
Yeah, I-- I can play something.

29:55.329 --> 29:58.499
Can you hand me that guitar?

30:07.141 --> 30:10.878
I haven't really played this
one out loud much, though.

32:41.195 --> 32:43.297
-You wrote that?

32:45.032 --> 32:49.303
-Yeah, uh, I'm still
kinda working on that one.

32:50.337 --> 32:53.307
-It's good.
-It's damn good.

32:53.340 --> 32:56.143
- Thanks.

32:56.376 --> 32:59.112
-Yo, you should come to
Kate's place later tonight.

32:59.146 --> 33:01.148
Bobbi and Z are
doing a house show.

33:01.181 --> 33:03.685
-Yeah, I can come.

33:05.152 --> 33:10.123
Actually, um, I host a podcast.

33:10.157 --> 33:12.092
Would you possibly...

33:12.125 --> 33:16.129
be willing to let me
interview you after the show?

33:17.331 --> 33:19.166
-Sure.

33:34.582 --> 33:38.185
-I record everything on my
phone, so if you could just

33:38.218 --> 33:42.489
direct your answers
here, that'd be great.

33:44.859 --> 33:49.797
The song you played tonight,
it seems like it could be

33:49.831 --> 33:52.165
autobiographical.

33:53.367 --> 33:58.171
-Mm, yeah, it's kinda of about
reveling in your darkness, too.

34:00.107 --> 34:02.242
-Could you talk a little
bit about your process?

34:02.276 --> 34:05.212
Like how you write?

34:05.245 --> 34:07.114
-I feel like you're so far away.

34:08.716 --> 34:10.552
Why don't you join us?

34:18.560 --> 34:20.193
That's better.

34:22.296 --> 34:24.231
...to get a lot
of opportunities,

34:24.264 --> 34:27.134
but we're too big
to be doing, like,

34:27.167 --> 34:30.070
the same local
scene all the time.

34:31.706 --> 34:34.509
I wanna break rules; I wanna
do shit that hasn't been done.

34:34.542 --> 34:37.210
I think that
really inspires people.

34:37.244 --> 34:39.146
-What other things are you into?

34:39.179 --> 34:41.883
Like besides music.

34:41.916 --> 34:43.450
- Well,
I really like, uh,

34:43.483 --> 34:46.621
experimental art
and performance art.

34:47.187 --> 34:49.724
And Z's really
into animal rights.

34:49.757 --> 34:54.194
I mean, we both are; we
both really love animals.

34:54.227 --> 34:56.430
Except fish.

34:56.463 --> 34:58.098
Ugh.

34:58.833 --> 35:02.135
You know, you should
party with us tonight.

35:02.436 --> 35:04.572
-You're going somewhere else?

35:04.606 --> 35:06.741
-I mean, I don't wanna
derail this interview right now.

35:06.774 --> 35:08.643
-Y-- yeah, I mean...

35:08.676 --> 35:11.813
we can finish it...later or...

35:11.846 --> 35:13.748
-I mean, whenever you want.

35:13.781 --> 35:16.116
Yeah, let's get outta here.
-Okay.

36:08.569 --> 36:11.271
Do you want one?

36:12.674 --> 36:14.542
-Sure.

36:18.846 --> 36:21.348
- Stick out your tongue.

36:25.352 --> 36:27.822
Can I draw a star on your face?

36:27.855 --> 36:28.990
-A star?

36:29.023 --> 36:32.426
-Yeah, like right here.

36:33.427 --> 36:36.296
-Okay, sure.
-Okay, close your eyes.

37:05.459 --> 37:07.628
Looks fuckin' awesome.

37:46.333 --> 37:48.636
-Good morning, Birdy.

39:36.043 --> 39:41.048
- Ahh!

39:45.452 --> 39:47.088
Ahh!

40:01.769 --> 40:04.437
- One.

40:04.471 --> 40:06.507
One.

40:06.540 --> 40:09.043
One.

40:09.610 --> 40:12.546
Is this consensual sex?

40:12.580 --> 40:13.547
Yes.

40:13.581 --> 40:15.917
Yes, it is.

40:17.985 --> 40:20.487
Two.

40:20.755 --> 40:22.790
Two.

40:22.823 --> 40:27.094
A dialogue between two lovers.

40:30.264 --> 40:32.499
Two.

40:35.603 --> 40:38.005
Two.

40:39.140 --> 40:43.945
A dialogue between my
id and my super-ego.

40:47.581 --> 40:49.583
Two.

40:56.857 --> 41:00.528
- It looks like it
was painted off of instinct.

41:00.561 --> 41:04.031
You can see it in
her brushstrokes.

41:05.533 --> 41:07.635
I've been booking a lot
more interviews for my podcast

41:07.668 --> 41:09.103
lately.

41:09.136 --> 41:11.172
-That's awesome!

41:11.205 --> 41:14.141
-Well, I'm trying to push myself
outside of my comfort zone more.

41:14.175 --> 41:15.977
-Are you uncomfortable?

41:16.010 --> 41:18.145
-Sometimes.

41:19.647 --> 41:23.517
I've been...going
to more shows...

41:24.719 --> 41:27.221
finding new sounds.

41:27.922 --> 41:30.992
That was the first performance
art piece I've ever seen.

41:31.025 --> 41:32.293
-So what'd you think?

41:33.995 --> 41:35.629
-It was captivating.

41:35.663 --> 41:38.966
-I think the appeal for
me is honestly just...

41:39.000 --> 41:41.969
witnessing something I
haven't seen before.

41:42.003 --> 41:45.539
You know, like creating a space
or environment for something

41:45.573 --> 41:47.842
completely new.

41:48.175 --> 41:49.877
I mean, you're an artist, right?

41:49.910 --> 41:51.645
You get it.

41:51.679 --> 41:54.548
-Yeah.
-Hey, I have an idea.

41:55.583 --> 41:58.019
Here, turn towards me.

41:58.352 --> 42:00.988
Okay, lemme take this, though.

42:01.022 --> 42:03.691
Oh, wait, actually,
you should finish it.

42:05.192 --> 42:06.894
Bottoms up.

42:15.669 --> 42:17.304
Okay.

42:17.872 --> 42:19.707
Now...

42:19.940 --> 42:23.844
in order for this to
work, no laughter, no smiles;

42:23.878 --> 42:25.679
we have to be
completely serious, okay?

42:25.713 --> 42:30.184
So the idea is you're gonna
mimic everything that I do,

42:30.217 --> 42:33.054
like facial
expressions, motions, okay?

42:33.087 --> 42:33.888
-Okay.

42:33.921 --> 42:37.725
-And if we do it
right, eventually,

42:37.758 --> 42:41.228
I'll start mimicking you back,
so that you won't be able to

42:41.262 --> 42:44.598
tell who's starting
and who's following.

42:44.632 --> 42:48.035
And then we'll just be
creating art simultaneously.

42:48.069 --> 42:49.770
Get it?
-Okay.

42:49.804 --> 42:53.240
- No smiling.

42:55.042 --> 42:56.210
Okay.

43:05.086 --> 43:07.621
No laughing!

43:08.656 --> 43:11.325
You're gonna make me laugh.

45:11.912 --> 45:14.448
I saw that podcast girl again.

45:15.883 --> 45:17.751
Lennon?

45:19.386 --> 45:22.456
She's weird.

45:24.959 --> 45:27.428
There's something I
kinda like about her, though.

45:53.588 --> 45:56.123
- Hello?
- Hey.

45:56.156 --> 45:57.958
Um, this is Lennon.

45:57.992 --> 45:59.226
- Oh, hey!

45:59.260 --> 46:00.961
What's up?

46:00.995 --> 46:02.162
-Um...

46:02.196 --> 46:07.301
I was wondering if you would
maybe wanna finish the interview

46:07.334 --> 46:09.236
for my podcast.

46:09.270 --> 46:10.804
Oh, yeah, totally!

46:10.838 --> 46:13.073
Well, I'll be home
in, like, 30 minutes.

46:13.107 --> 46:16.977
Do you wanna meet at my place?
-That would be awesome.

46:24.918 --> 46:27.054
- If you see
the cats around, watch out;

46:27.087 --> 46:28.989
Lyla's kind of an asshole.

46:29.023 --> 46:32.259
But yeah, I actually have to go
grab a few things from Z real

46:32.293 --> 46:34.428
fast, but you can
make yourself at home.

46:34.461 --> 46:36.930
I'll be like five minutes or so.

46:36.964 --> 46:39.601
We can start the
interview as soon as I get back.

46:39.634 --> 46:40.834
-Sure.

46:40.868 --> 46:42.504
- I'll see you in a bit.

49:09.450 --> 49:10.718
All right.

49:11.251 --> 49:12.720
I'm ready!

49:14.254 --> 49:18.292
Um, do you wanna do this
outside so we can smoke?

49:18.325 --> 49:21.028
- Sure.
- Okay, let's go.

49:44.218 --> 49:45.720
-Okay.

49:47.822 --> 49:49.122
Take two.

49:49.156 --> 49:51.024
-Take two.

49:52.159 --> 49:55.329
-I'm here with Bobbi Kitten, the
lead singer for the band Damn

49:55.362 --> 49:56.296
the Witch Siren.

49:56.330 --> 50:00.200
-Yo, yo, yo, what's
up, Lennon listeners?!

50:00.234 --> 50:04.471
-She's wearing a large fur
coat, looks like it could be...

50:04.506 --> 50:06.139
bear fur?

50:06.173 --> 50:08.175
-Is that bear fur?

50:08.208 --> 50:09.677
-God, no!

50:09.711 --> 50:12.212
Lennon, have you been
paying attention at all?

50:13.848 --> 50:18.653
This is a fake fur coat;
I repeat, fake fur coat.

50:18.686 --> 50:21.656
I do not condone the slaughter
of poor, innocent creatures.

50:21.689 --> 50:22.824
- Okay, okay.

50:22.857 --> 50:24.324
-Except if it's a fish.

50:24.358 --> 50:26.326
Stop.

50:26.360 --> 50:28.328
- Okay.

50:28.362 --> 50:30.163
So...

50:30.197 --> 50:34.836
when you're writing, do you feel
like your fanbase influences

50:34.869 --> 50:36.704
your writing?

50:36.738 --> 50:39.707
-Well, I mean, I think
it used to a lot more,

50:39.741 --> 50:40.942
when I first started out.

50:40.975 --> 50:45.178
I started this band wanting to
write dance music because nobody

50:45.212 --> 50:47.180
in this town is, like,
writing dance music.

50:47.214 --> 50:49.182
I just wanted people
to have fun, you know?

50:49.216 --> 50:52.185
Feel like they
could enjoy themselves.

50:52.219 --> 50:54.388
But lately, I just
feel...

50:54.421 --> 50:59.092
I don't know, like I'm writing
more...emotional stuff --

50:59.126 --> 51:01.261
stuff that gets
me really excited.

51:01.295 --> 51:03.363
I'm writing stuff for myself...

51:03.397 --> 51:04.532
and my cat.

51:09.269 --> 51:11.706
-So what are you working on now?

51:11.739 --> 51:13.608
-Um, yeah, so I've been...

51:13.641 --> 51:18.078
writing stuff on the piano, and
I'm really proud of, like...

51:19.246 --> 51:22.249
all these words that are
coming out of me, you know?

51:22.282 --> 51:24.752
And I'm hoping to
collaborate with my girl Lennon,

51:24.786 --> 51:26.788
who is an incredible writer.

51:27.755 --> 51:30.558
Okay, I'm gonna edit that out.

51:30.592 --> 51:31.893
-Don't!

51:31.926 --> 51:33.628
Why would you do that?

51:33.661 --> 51:36.263
Seriously, you should
be proud of that shit.

51:36.296 --> 51:38.298
It's one of the
best things about you.

51:38.332 --> 51:39.601
-What?

51:39.634 --> 51:42.402
-Your art, your ideas.

51:42.436 --> 51:45.272
I lot of people
don't have shit to say.

51:45.305 --> 51:46.908
And you do.

51:46.941 --> 51:49.276
And it's important.

51:50.177 --> 51:52.279
-So...

51:52.312 --> 51:54.649
what's the best thing
about Bobbi Kitten?

51:54.682 --> 51:56.718
- I don't wanna
do that.

51:56.751 --> 51:58.418
-No, seriously.

51:58.452 --> 52:00.888
What's your favorite
thing about yourself?

52:00.922 --> 52:02.255
I wanna know.

52:04.458 --> 52:06.794
Um...

52:13.300 --> 52:15.603
- The scene has a
tendency of shifting from day to

52:15.637 --> 52:17.170
day.

52:17.672 --> 52:20.808
A perpetual pursuit
for something new.

52:21.341 --> 52:23.645
A true musician pushes
boundaries in every way

52:23.678 --> 52:25.813
possible...

52:27.314 --> 52:30.283
using their art as a platform
for something completely

52:30.317 --> 52:31.953
original.

52:35.355 --> 52:38.325
Those in the scene know this.

56:48.109 --> 56:49.210
- I love it.

56:49.243 --> 56:50.443
It's amazing.

56:50.477 --> 56:52.213
You should totally record this.

56:53.748 --> 56:55.883
-I mean, you really
got something, Lennon.

56:55.917 --> 56:57.618
Like...

56:57.652 --> 56:59.787
-I just worry about...

57:00.254 --> 57:02.623
what people will
think and, like,

57:02.657 --> 57:05.927
sharing that kind of
stuff feels so intimate.

57:05.960 --> 57:07.061
- Well, it is.

57:07.094 --> 57:11.464
I mean, that's why it
inspires people -- being real.

57:30.584 --> 57:33.453
You
should totally record this.

57:33.654 --> 57:34.989
Well, it is.

57:35.022 --> 57:38.592
I mean, that's why it
inspires people -- being real.

59:11.786 --> 59:13.721
- I love
the sound of your voice.

59:13.754 --> 59:15.556
-Uh...

59:15.890 --> 59:18.759
I hate the sound of my voice.

59:28.402 --> 59:32.206
Holy shit, you have, like,
so many recordings on here.

59:32.239 --> 59:34.742
It's wild.
-Yeah.

59:36.043 --> 59:37.878
-Here, let me try one.

1:00:00.101 --> 1:00:02.269
- After some persuasion,
I've decided I'll be releasing

1:00:02.303 --> 1:00:04.939
my first EP next week.

1:00:05.272 --> 1:00:08.776
As a writer, I've mostly
kept my work to myself.

1:00:09.110 --> 1:00:11.645
As a writer, I've
mostly kept my work to myself.

1:00:11.679 --> 1:00:14.315
After some persuasion,
I've decided I'm going to be

1:00:14.348 --> 1:00:17.952
releasing my first EP next week.

1:00:18.252 --> 1:00:21.922
As a writer, I've mostly
kept my work to myself.

1:00:22.156 --> 1:00:25.960
But in an effort to push myself
outside of my comfort zone,

1:00:25.993 --> 1:00:28.762
I'm going to be
releasing some of my songs.

1:00:28.796 --> 1:00:31.298
I'll be releasing them on
all social media platforms,

1:00:31.332 --> 1:00:34.001
so stay tuned for that.

1:00:40.708 --> 1:00:45.012
You know, I've been working
on some new music recently.

1:00:45.045 --> 1:00:47.114
-For your podcast?

1:00:47.148 --> 1:00:49.049
-Well...

1:00:49.483 --> 1:00:52.386
I might release it on there.

1:00:53.721 --> 1:00:55.189
-Uh, before I forget...

1:00:55.222 --> 1:00:57.725
some cash from Mom.

1:01:00.961 --> 1:01:02.463
-Do you wanna listen to it?

1:01:02.496 --> 1:01:03.764
-To what?

1:01:03.797 --> 1:01:05.299
-To my new music.

1:01:05.332 --> 1:01:07.334
-In here?

1:01:11.772 --> 1:01:13.707
Okay, whatever.

1:01:13.741 --> 1:01:15.342
Stupid.

1:01:32.193 --> 1:01:34.428
You wrote this?

1:01:37.532 --> 1:01:39.400
This is good.

1:01:40.901 --> 1:01:42.469
It's really good, Lennon.

1:01:42.503 --> 1:01:44.038
-Thanks.

1:02:24.912 --> 1:02:28.516
-How come Z wears
that mask all the time?

1:02:29.416 --> 1:02:32.219
-People wear masks every day;
maybe he's just a little bit

1:02:32.253 --> 1:02:34.922
more straightforward about it.

1:02:36.023 --> 1:02:37.925
I honestly think it's 'cause he
doesn't really like people very

1:02:37.958 --> 1:02:39.793
much.

1:02:40.461 --> 1:02:43.063
I think he likes
putting fear in people.

1:02:43.097 --> 1:02:46.800
I think it's a way
for him to, like...

1:02:46.834 --> 1:02:49.403
not have to deal
with people's bullshit.

1:02:54.275 --> 1:02:55.943
Later, bitch!

1:02:55.976 --> 1:02:57.911
Have fun at work!

1:03:37.151 --> 1:03:39.453
-This Wednesday night, your
boy will be playing at The

1:03:39.486 --> 1:03:40.454
Livestock.

1:03:40.487 --> 1:03:42.624
Come watch me; I've got
some new music to share,

1:03:42.657 --> 1:03:44.358
and--

1:03:44.391 --> 1:03:45.192
it's a blessing.

1:03:45.225 --> 1:03:46.026
I'm excited.

1:03:46.060 --> 1:03:46.960
Let's go.

1:03:46.994 --> 1:03:47.595
Woo!

1:03:49.997 --> 1:03:50.632
- What'd you get on it?

1:03:50.665 --> 1:03:52.366
Oh!

1:03:52.399 --> 1:03:53.967
- So we're going
in a new direction.

1:03:54.001 --> 1:03:56.036
- You know, we
just got a noise complaint;

1:03:56.070 --> 1:03:57.639
they're trying to kick us out.

1:04:02.042 --> 1:04:05.145
- What great things
are marred with words only

1:04:05.179 --> 1:04:07.214
intended to fill the void.

1:04:07.247 --> 1:04:11.385
-Tonight, ladies and gentlemen,
I am that second mouse.

1:04:11.418 --> 1:04:12.920
- Butter mouse!

1:04:13.187 --> 1:04:15.222
- Say hi.

1:04:15.255 --> 1:04:16.990
- Hi.
- Hi!

1:04:17.024 --> 1:04:19.594
I don't know.

1:04:36.544 --> 1:04:38.178
- Thank
you so much, we're WYD.

1:04:38.212 --> 1:04:39.413
This is your new song.

1:04:39.446 --> 1:04:40.914
- Hey.

1:04:41.248 --> 1:04:42.950
It's a pinot noir.

1:04:42.983 --> 1:04:43.917
- Thanks.

1:04:43.951 --> 1:04:46.353
- Like right
now is my pinot phase,

1:04:46.387 --> 1:04:47.254
but...

1:04:47.287 --> 1:04:50.891
I kinda dabble in
some merlots, you know?

1:08:17.599 --> 1:08:20.902
Uh, listen, I'm not gonna call
anyone out by name or anything

1:08:20.935 --> 1:08:22.469
like that...

1:08:22.502 --> 1:08:25.740
but there are some
fake-ass musicians out there,

1:08:25.773 --> 1:08:26.908
and I gotta get
this off my chest;

1:08:26.941 --> 1:08:28.576
trust me, I really do.

1:08:28.610 --> 1:08:31.411
And the thing is, I guess, that
I'm most pissed off about is

1:08:31.445 --> 1:08:33.615
because I thought I was a
good judge of character.

1:08:33.648 --> 1:08:35.449
I really did.

1:09:36.744 --> 1:09:38.546
-Hey, Bobbi.

1:09:38.913 --> 1:09:41.214
It's Lennon.

1:09:47.522 --> 1:09:50.223
You haven't been responding.

1:09:50.257 --> 1:09:51.592
Um...

1:09:52.392 --> 1:09:54.862
I just wanna make sure...

1:09:56.731 --> 1:09:59.232
Are we okay?

1:10:01.536 --> 1:10:03.370
Hello?

1:10:03.671 --> 1:10:04.972
Bobbi?

1:10:15.650 --> 1:10:17.685
So what's the
best thing about Bobbi Kitten?

1:10:17.719 --> 1:10:19.721
- I don't
wanna do that.

1:10:19.754 --> 1:10:21.856
- No, seriously.

1:10:21.889 --> 1:10:23.758
What's your favorite
thing about yourself?

1:10:23.791 --> 1:10:24.926
I wanna know.

1:10:27.061 --> 1:10:28.896
Um...

1:10:32.399 --> 1:10:34.401
I feel confident.

1:10:36.637 --> 1:10:38.740
I have stuff to say.

1:10:39.473 --> 1:10:41.408
And...

1:10:41.642 --> 1:10:46.480
I don't know, I guess I
feel really sure of myself.

1:10:46.881 --> 1:10:49.449
And I like that I don't ever
have to second-guess myself,

1:10:49.483 --> 1:10:51.284
you know?

1:10:58.526 --> 1:11:00.595
Here, lemme hold this.

1:11:00.628 --> 1:11:02.063
You bitch, come on!

1:11:02.096 --> 1:11:04.397
All right, just, like,
you know what I mean?

1:11:04.431 --> 1:11:05.566
- I don't...

1:11:05.600 --> 1:11:08.435
- Come on, and then
we can build up after that.

1:11:09.369 --> 1:11:10.437
You're too shy!

1:11:10.470 --> 1:11:11.572
You're too shy.

1:11:11.606 --> 1:11:14.307
Free yourself.

1:11:14.341 --> 1:11:16.911
I don't give a
fuck what they think.

1:11:16.944 --> 1:11:18.579
I don't give a fuck!

1:11:18.613 --> 1:11:21.414
Woo!

1:11:21.448 --> 1:11:23.751
Woo, woo, woo!

1:12:26.013 --> 1:12:27.148
-Wait.

1:12:27.181 --> 1:12:29.016
Hold on.

1:12:32.520 --> 1:12:34.856
You should wear this.

1:13:29.243 --> 1:13:32.213
It is my intention
for my podcast...

1:13:37.618 --> 1:13:42.156
My intention for my podcast
is to explore this city's...

1:13:42.790 --> 1:13:45.492
underground music scene.

1:13:46.493 --> 1:13:50.463
It is my intention for my
podcast to explore this...

1:13:50.998 --> 1:13:54.168
this city's underground m--...

1:13:57.605 --> 1:14:00.508
Following
cutting-edge artists...

1:14:01.609 --> 1:14:03.945
Following cutting-edge...

1:14:04.645 --> 1:14:07.447
musicians--

1:14:08.683 --> 1:14:11.919
I intend to capture
a true--

1:14:11.953 --> 1:14:14.487
a true depiction...

1:14:14.655 --> 1:14:16.590
of--

1:14:20.661 --> 1:14:22.196
I...

1:14:27.635 --> 1:14:30.503
I-- I belong here.

1:17:28.816 --> 1:17:32.319
You aren't gonna pull a
Danny Brooks on me, are you?

1:17:33.053 --> 1:17:35.823
-Are you, like, a stalker?

1:17:36.490 --> 1:17:40.361
-I'm not a stalker,
I host a podcast.

1:17:41.862 --> 1:17:44.698
I...research.

1:17:46.033 --> 1:17:48.702
-You researched me?

1:17:49.170 --> 1:17:53.774
-Yes, because you
were on my podcast.

1:17:58.379 --> 1:18:01.882
-I never even listened
to one of your podcasts.

1:18:10.891 --> 1:18:13.928
-Why have you been ignoring me?

1:18:15.095 --> 1:18:17.932
-You bring your
journal with you, Lennon?

1:18:19.066 --> 1:18:20.868
-Yes.

1:18:21.902 --> 1:18:24.205
-And all those words in there...

1:18:24.772 --> 1:18:27.441
you wrote those?

1:18:29.777 --> 1:18:31.345
-Yes.

1:18:31.378 --> 1:18:34.215
-You know I know
you stole that song.

1:18:35.783 --> 1:18:37.785
-I don't know what
you're talking about.

1:18:37.818 --> 1:18:40.387
-What, you think you're just
gonna keep lying about it?

1:18:40.421 --> 1:18:42.890
Like, you're just gonna play
it off like you wrote all those

1:18:42.923 --> 1:18:43.592
songs?

1:18:43.625 --> 1:18:45.859
Like no one's gonna find out?

1:18:45.893 --> 1:18:46.894
What are you gonna do?

1:18:46.927 --> 1:18:48.262
You know I'm
gonna tell everyone.

1:18:48.295 --> 1:18:50.231
You know that, right?

1:18:50.565 --> 1:18:52.900
Do you steal my songs, too?

1:18:52.933 --> 1:18:54.768
-No.

1:18:54.802 --> 1:18:56.904
- Lemme see
your journal, then.

1:18:57.404 --> 1:18:58.540
-Why?

1:18:58.573 --> 1:19:00.808
-'Cause I wanna see it.

1:19:09.316 --> 1:19:10.884
- Stop!

1:20:04.905 --> 1:20:08.108
The scene has a tendency
of shifting from day to day.

1:20:09.376 --> 1:20:13.013
I suppose that's why
I began this podcast:

1:20:14.315 --> 1:20:17.951
to collect inspiration, to
observe artists and their

1:20:17.985 --> 1:20:20.120
creativity...

1:20:20.154 --> 1:20:22.890
their originality...

1:20:23.525 --> 1:20:26.860
and to push myself
outside of my comfort zone.

1:20:33.500 --> 1:20:35.869
Now...

1:20:37.071 --> 1:20:40.207
I finally feel confident.

1:20:40.508 --> 1:20:44.646
I have stuff to say, and...

1:20:44.679 --> 1:20:47.848
I guess I feel
really sure of myself.

1:20:48.516 --> 1:20:52.353
And I like that I never
have to second-guess myself.

1:20:53.287 --> 1:20:55.356
I know I don't have
that many listeners,

1:20:55.389 --> 1:20:58.025
but do those of
you who do listen,

1:20:58.058 --> 1:20:59.927
thank you.

1:22:04.759 --> 1:22:06.126
Fuck.
