WEBVTT

00:01.131 --> 00:02.393
<i>Previously on</i> All Rise.

00:02.393 --> 00:03.568
People in the state
of California

00:03.568 --> 00:04.787
versus Carl Brewer.

00:04.787 --> 00:06.006
We, the jury,

00:06.006 --> 00:07.485
find the defendant not guilty.

00:07.485 --> 00:09.357
I saw you.
Can I [indistinct]?

00:09.357 --> 00:11.402
Can we just talk about this, please?

00:11.402 --> 00:13.143
I need some time.

00:13.143 --> 00:15.580
- Collier, you look great.
- Why haven't you told him

00:15.580 --> 00:17.408
that the divorce papers
were signed?

00:17.408 --> 00:19.236
I wanted to make sure
you were okay first.

00:19.236 --> 00:20.977
- What do you mean dead?
- I should have taken

00:20.977 --> 00:22.631
Collier's call more seriously.

00:22.631 --> 00:24.241
I could have
checked on him sooner.

00:37.559 --> 00:39.256
Saw your case
on the news this morning.

00:39.256 --> 00:41.432
- Hm?
- Is J-Lo really a witness?

00:41.432 --> 00:44.131
She was in the restaurant
when the lobster got stolen,

00:44.131 --> 00:47.003
so technically, yes,
she could be.

00:47.003 --> 00:48.831
Whoever stole
it is getting all the love

00:48.831 --> 00:50.746
on social media
for her activism.

00:51.877 --> 00:53.488
I'm going to go
get in the shower.

00:53.488 --> 00:54.750
Oh. Can I join you?

00:54.750 --> 00:56.056
I have no time for round two.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.883
That would be round three.

00:57.883 --> 00:59.581
First time didn't count.

00:59.581 --> 01:02.018
Ouch.

01:02.018 --> 01:05.326
- So you got your hearing today?
- Yeah.

01:05.326 --> 01:06.762
Look out,
Maggie Palmer is the second

01:06.762 --> 01:08.590
best lawyer
at arguing motions.

01:08.590 --> 01:09.982
- Who is the first?
- You.

01:13.812 --> 01:15.988
Hey, what's going on?

01:15.988 --> 01:19.296
I've never worked on an organ
trafficking case before.

01:19.296 --> 01:21.777
It is overwhelming.

01:21.777 --> 01:23.387
It's been two weeks
since Collier died.

01:23.387 --> 01:25.346
- Mark, I told you I'm fine.
- I know,

01:25.346 --> 01:27.217
- but I'm just saying--
- You know what I was thinking?

01:27.217 --> 01:28.784
We should elope.

01:30.742 --> 01:33.354
Amy, you've been putting off
planning our wedding for months,

01:33.354 --> 01:35.269
and now suddenly
you want to elope?

01:35.269 --> 01:37.314
Well, I don't have time
to plan a wedding right now,

01:37.314 --> 01:40.187
and I really
want to be your wife.

01:40.187 --> 01:42.189
What do you think?

01:42.189 --> 01:44.016
- I think I want a wedding.
- You?

01:44.016 --> 01:45.714
- Yeah.
- Really?

01:45.714 --> 01:47.716
I want a dance party.
I want the drunk uncles.

01:47.716 --> 01:49.631
I want all of our friends
bawling their eyes out

01:49.631 --> 01:51.023
when we say I do.

01:51.023 --> 01:54.157
I think...
I think we deserve that.

01:55.376 --> 01:56.725
Wedding it is.

01:58.553 --> 02:00.207
Maybe I do have time
for round two.

02:02.426 --> 02:03.993
I'll be right there.

02:10.086 --> 02:12.175
<i>Hey, Lola.
Am I waking you up?</i>

02:12.175 --> 02:14.525
Just walking into my chambers.
<i>This early?</i>

02:14.525 --> 02:16.397
With Robin and Bailey
in Detroit,

02:16.397 --> 02:18.442
home just
doesn't feel like home.

02:19.139 --> 02:20.531
Robinson said.

02:20.531 --> 02:23.317
- Just be patient.
- I know.

02:23.317 --> 02:25.014
<i>Why are you up so early?</i>

02:25.014 --> 02:28.539
I think I need your help
planning a wedding.

02:28.539 --> 02:29.714
<i>Your wedding?</i>

02:29.714 --> 02:31.281
Are you sure Amy's ready?

02:31.281 --> 02:32.717
<i>She's the one pushing it.</i>

02:32.717 --> 02:34.066
She just asked me--

02:34.066 --> 02:35.503
she just asked me to elope.

02:35.503 --> 02:37.331
And I think it's too soon.

02:37.331 --> 02:40.682
I mean, she needs space
to grieve, right?

02:40.682 --> 02:43.380
Everyone deals
with grief differently, Mark.

02:43.380 --> 02:45.817
Just be there for her.

02:45.817 --> 02:47.471
<i>As far as the wedding,</i>

02:47.471 --> 02:49.081
<i>maybe start
with something simple.</i>

02:49.081 --> 02:50.561
How about cake?

02:51.432 --> 02:52.998
Cake?

02:52.998 --> 02:55.000
...certain
for a judge to reconsider

02:55.000 --> 02:56.480
some of the charges
against the defendant.

02:57.655 --> 03:00.005
Gabriel Salas,
this is Sara Castillo,

03:00.005 --> 03:01.572
our victim's advocate,

03:01.572 --> 03:03.139
and she'll be
taking care of you.

03:03.139 --> 03:04.575
- Gabriel. With pleasure.
- Sarah.

03:04.575 --> 03:06.229
<i>Mucho gusto.</i> I can just--

03:06.229 --> 03:07.665
Here, take my seat.

03:07.665 --> 03:10.277
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

03:10.277 --> 03:12.757
Just please continue.
I'll just be catching up.

03:12.757 --> 03:14.890
Mr. Salas,
I want to make sure that you--

03:14.890 --> 03:16.674
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

03:16.674 --> 03:19.547
Mr. Salas' kidney
was brutally taken from him,

03:19.547 --> 03:21.201
and he just
had another surgery.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.680
- We have a hearing in an hour--
- Sorry,

03:22.680 --> 03:25.335
- what do you brutally taken?
- Stolen.

03:25.335 --> 03:28.469
Miss Castillo,
I thought Callen briefed you.

03:28.469 --> 03:29.861
How was-- How?

03:30.645 --> 03:32.473
I woke up in downtown L.A.

03:32.473 --> 03:34.170
in pain,
not knowing where I was.

03:34.170 --> 03:36.912
I saw that I had
stitches on my abdomen,

03:36.912 --> 03:40.220
called 911,
took me to the hospital,

03:40.220 --> 03:42.744
and that's where they
told me that I was...

03:42.744 --> 03:44.180
missing my kidney.

03:44.180 --> 03:45.964
Cops start
an investigation.

03:45.964 --> 03:47.923
They caught the traffickers
who took his kidney.

03:47.923 --> 03:50.447
And I am prosecuting
the man who bought it.

03:50.447 --> 03:53.363
Now, Mr. Salas,
I want to make sure

03:53.363 --> 03:55.104
that you understand
what's going to happen--

03:55.104 --> 03:57.889
And why did you have
another surgery?

03:57.889 --> 04:00.196
I eventually got an infection.

04:00.196 --> 04:02.242
- Oh, God--
- But it's okay.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.506
I'm all good now. I'll--
I'll recover. I'll recover.

04:05.506 --> 04:07.377
Miss Castillo, one second.

04:11.816 --> 04:14.602
Miss Castillo,
your job is that of an advocate.

04:14.602 --> 04:16.125
Not of a therapist.

04:16.125 --> 04:18.475
Look, being empathetic
is not a flaw.

04:18.475 --> 04:21.609
In one hour,
a judge will determine

04:21.609 --> 04:23.828
whether the charges against
the defendant are dismissed.

04:23.828 --> 04:26.744
It is my job to prepare
Mr. Salas for what is coming.

04:26.744 --> 04:29.138
Bottom line,
I have work to do.

04:29.138 --> 04:30.574
This is my meeting too.

04:30.574 --> 04:32.837
Mr. Salas. I'm sorry.

04:32.837 --> 04:35.013
Let's discuss exactly
what's going to happen

04:35.013 --> 04:37.233
once you walk
in the courtroom.

04:37.233 --> 04:40.410
Your Honor, I filed a 995 motion
to dismiss the mayhem

04:40.410 --> 04:42.412
and residential
burglary charges.

04:42.412 --> 04:44.632
It is clear from the preliminary
hearing transcript

04:44.632 --> 04:46.503
that my client
did purchase the kidney.

04:46.503 --> 04:49.376
But he had no idea
violence would be used.

04:49.376 --> 04:50.899
He did not target the victim.

04:50.899 --> 04:52.379
And he certainly
didn't perform

04:52.379 --> 04:53.902
the extraction of the organ.

04:53.902 --> 04:55.599
I would also like
to highlight that

04:55.599 --> 04:58.167
the two traffickers
were arrested and charged.

04:58.167 --> 04:59.821
They both confessed
to surgically removing

04:59.821 --> 05:01.301
Gabriel Salas' kidney.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.215
Ms. Quinn, you are aware

05:03.215 --> 05:06.828
that whatever is going on
in another case is irrelevant?

05:06.828 --> 05:09.178
Yes, Your Honor.

05:09.178 --> 05:11.398
I would just like to add
that my client

05:11.398 --> 05:13.095
only had a few months
left to live.

05:13.095 --> 05:15.750
Mr. Davis never wished
harm on anyone else.

05:15.750 --> 05:18.187
His intention was
to simply skip the extensive

05:18.187 --> 05:19.580
transplant waiting list.

05:20.668 --> 05:22.409
People?

05:22.409 --> 05:25.368
Whether the defendant
extracted the kidney

05:25.368 --> 05:28.545
or solely purchased it doesn't
change the main issue at hand,

05:28.545 --> 05:31.331
which is he contributed
to organ trafficking.

05:32.549 --> 05:34.334
Okay.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.032
The motion is granted
and the mayhem

05:37.032 --> 05:39.208
and residential burglary
charges are dismissed.

05:39.208 --> 05:41.210
However, the charge

05:41.210 --> 05:44.256
for illegally acquiring
an organ in violation

05:44.256 --> 05:47.956
of Penal Code Section
367F remains

05:47.956 --> 05:50.132
and the trial
will proceed on that charge.

06:02.492 --> 06:04.581
Hey, Em.
- Hey.

06:06.235 --> 06:08.542
I was just about
to go get my caffeine.

06:08.542 --> 06:10.935
- Thank you.
- You sleep better last night?

06:10.935 --> 06:12.589
I don't understand.
You're the one who got hurt.

06:12.589 --> 06:14.374
So why am I the one
having nightmares?

06:14.374 --> 06:15.984
Because you had
to be there for me.

06:15.984 --> 06:18.334
It's okay to be releasing
the stress of life.

06:18.334 --> 06:20.597
Luke, I need you
to join Emily as co-counsel

06:20.597 --> 06:23.470
in the Blue Lobster case,
the defendant, Ann Connelly,

06:23.470 --> 06:25.341
she was cut out
of the family.

06:25.341 --> 06:26.777
She can't afford
a private attorney.

06:26.777 --> 06:28.431
Carol, you know, um,

06:28.431 --> 06:30.912
Luke is super crazy busy.

06:30.912 --> 06:33.480
Also, the office
is overloaded with cases,

06:33.480 --> 06:36.134
so I can just--
I can take this one myself.

06:36.134 --> 06:38.528
Luke has experienced
defending animal activists,

06:38.528 --> 06:40.791
and you've proven
to make a great team.

06:44.316 --> 06:47.232
Take a look at the case file.
I'll just be-- I'll be--

06:47.232 --> 06:51.323
One sec. Hey, Carol.
Can I grab you for a sec?

06:52.020 --> 06:53.543
Hey!

06:55.066 --> 06:57.504
You asked me to come back,
and all you're kicking me

06:57.504 --> 07:01.029
are death cases
and co-counsel.

07:01.029 --> 07:03.901
We're all still recovering from
what happened in the courthouse.

07:03.901 --> 07:06.077
Oh, my God. I shouldn't have
told you about the nightmares.

07:06.077 --> 07:08.776
- Look, I'm much better.
- I don't doubt it.

07:08.776 --> 07:10.342
You're the strongest
woman I know.

07:10.342 --> 07:11.996
But in the meantime,
it doesn't hurt

07:11.996 --> 07:13.520
to be surrounded
by those who love you.

07:20.788 --> 07:22.006
Wow.

07:29.013 --> 07:31.712
Sherri, you want to grab
dinner tonight? My treat.

07:31.712 --> 07:34.018
I am actually having dinner
with my father tonight.

07:34.018 --> 07:36.368
Right. I forgot your dad
was here.

07:36.368 --> 07:38.545
- How is he?
- I've been trying

07:38.545 --> 07:40.111
to convince him
to go to the doctor,

07:40.111 --> 07:41.722
- but he refuses. So...
- Good luck.

07:41.722 --> 07:43.593
Yeah, so no.

07:45.856 --> 07:48.424
Robin hasn't texted since
I called Bailey last night.

07:48.424 --> 07:49.947
He's probably busy.

07:49.947 --> 07:51.558
I mean, families
can be time consuming.

07:51.558 --> 07:54.343
Believe me,
I forgot that, too.

08:03.178 --> 08:05.963
Your Honor,
I don't mean to presume,

08:05.963 --> 08:09.010
but should you need a shoulder?

08:09.880 --> 08:11.012
Thank you.

08:15.016 --> 08:16.800
Actually, um...

08:18.106 --> 08:20.369
there is something.

08:26.549 --> 08:27.898
- And you wanted to live?
- Of course.

08:27.898 --> 08:29.509
Okay. Well, elaborate on that.

08:29.509 --> 08:32.512
Tell the jury about
your reason to live.

08:32.512 --> 08:36.254
I want to see my children
graduate college.

08:36.254 --> 08:37.908
I want to grow old with my wife.

08:41.433 --> 08:45.133
We won't deny that you purchased
the kidney, Damon.

08:45.133 --> 08:48.092
We will show your
motivation for doing so.

08:48.092 --> 08:50.094
- When will I take the stand?
- Toward the end.

08:50.094 --> 08:51.705
I want to close with you.

08:51.705 --> 08:54.185
We will hit them
with science and facts first.

08:54.185 --> 08:56.579
Your nephrologist
will paint a picture

08:56.579 --> 08:58.581
of how messed up
our health care system is.

08:58.581 --> 09:00.191
And by the time you speak,

09:00.191 --> 09:02.629
the jury will understand
what you had to do.

09:05.196 --> 09:08.983
I feel terrible that
the kidney that saved my life

09:08.983 --> 09:10.811
was...

09:10.811 --> 09:12.726
...brutally taken
from someone else.

09:12.726 --> 09:15.032
You're lucky
to be alive, Damon.

09:15.032 --> 09:17.731
Not everyone
gets that chance.

09:17.731 --> 09:20.255
I plan to make sure
that you walk free

09:20.255 --> 09:23.650
so that you can live the life
that you fought for.

09:24.694 --> 09:26.261
Thank you, Ms. Quinn.

09:34.530 --> 09:37.011
I had no idea
the lobster so expensive.

09:37.011 --> 09:39.840
It was a stupid bet
with some friends.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.319
It was a bet?

09:41.319 --> 09:43.060
So you weren't trying
to save its life

09:43.060 --> 09:45.193
because the media
is calling you an activist.

09:45.193 --> 09:47.630
I haven't even
talked to the media.

09:47.630 --> 09:50.590
I have never taken
anything in my life.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.766
The lobster
was up for display.

09:52.766 --> 09:54.419
It seemed harmless.

09:54.419 --> 09:56.117
Okay, well, either way,

09:56.117 --> 09:57.771
the restaurant is putting
a ridiculous price on it,

09:57.771 --> 10:00.730
so we need to defend you
as if you stole diamonds.

10:00.730 --> 10:02.819
Do you think any of your friends
would testify?

10:03.994 --> 10:06.606
Oh, I'm not sure.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.912
Well, we're also
going to see text messages

10:08.912 --> 10:11.088
or whatever communication
you had with them.

10:11.088 --> 10:12.960
I don't know
if we texted about it.

10:14.396 --> 10:16.703
Listen.

10:16.703 --> 10:17.573
I totally understand
that you want to protect

10:17.573 --> 10:19.270
your friends, and I get it.

10:19.270 --> 10:21.838
But we have no case
if we have no witnesses

10:21.838 --> 10:23.144
to back up your story.

10:26.060 --> 10:29.541
You know what? Why don't you
go grab some breakfast, Anna,

10:29.541 --> 10:31.543
and we'll continue this
a little bit later, okay?

10:31.543 --> 10:32.849
Okay. Thanks.

10:34.982 --> 10:36.070
What's wrong?

10:50.345 --> 10:52.260
Hey.

10:52.260 --> 10:55.263
So, another dead woman
found in the dumpster.

10:55.263 --> 10:57.265
I take it
you saw the news.

10:57.265 --> 10:58.788
It can't be
a coincidence, Tony

10:58.788 --> 11:01.008
Aha, that is the voice

11:01.008 --> 11:02.836
of obsession
I'm hearing, Callen.

11:02.836 --> 11:04.402
Don't tell me
you don't see it, too.

11:04.402 --> 11:06.535
It's not about
what I see.

11:06.535 --> 11:08.755
So why don't you allow
the detectives to collect

11:08.755 --> 11:11.453
more evidence before
you jump to any conclusion?

11:11.453 --> 11:13.542
Well, there's not even
a suspect yet.

11:14.761 --> 11:17.633
- Delivery for Mark Callen.
- Oh, yeah.

11:18.895 --> 11:21.724
hose birthday?
- I'm planning my wedding.

11:23.334 --> 11:25.685
You do know
you can get samples, right?

11:25.685 --> 11:27.121
Yeah.

11:27.121 --> 11:28.775
Oh, man.

11:28.775 --> 11:30.472
Why don't you hire
a wedding planner

11:30.472 --> 11:32.039
like everybody else?

11:32.039 --> 11:33.649
I don't want to hire
a wedding planner

11:33.649 --> 11:35.346
in case Amy decides
to pull the brakes.

11:40.308 --> 11:41.439
Thank you.

11:43.398 --> 11:45.922
That is not something
you want to hear

11:45.922 --> 11:47.445
from a groom to be.

11:48.490 --> 11:51.014
Her ex-husband
recently passed away

11:51.014 --> 11:53.321
and... she's
dealing with it by...

11:54.061 --> 11:55.671
avoiding it completely.

11:55.671 --> 11:57.455
Well, obsessing
over Carl Brewer

11:57.455 --> 11:58.935
isn't going to change that.

11:58.935 --> 12:01.721
- Then what will?
- Your presence, Mark.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.723
Just be the required
presence for her.

12:06.377 --> 12:08.249
Let her face it
when she's ready.

12:11.121 --> 12:12.775
You've got correspondents.

12:12.775 --> 12:14.734
Thank you, Sherri.

12:15.691 --> 12:16.866
Oh.

12:20.565 --> 12:22.045
Did anything else
come with this postcard?

12:22.045 --> 12:23.307
- No.
- Are you sure?

12:23.307 --> 12:24.831
It doesn't have a sender.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.136
Well, I guarantee you
the only things

12:26.136 --> 12:27.834
I ever put aside

12:27.834 --> 12:29.661
are intense love letters
and potential anthrax.

12:29.661 --> 12:31.228
You might be joking,
but I know

12:31.228 --> 12:32.926
that's not too far
from the truth.

12:32.926 --> 12:35.755
I'm worried
it could be from...

12:36.930 --> 12:38.279
Andre.

12:51.161 --> 12:54.251
Marky Mark,
what are you doing tonight?

12:54.251 --> 12:58.255
Okay, so when is your next
checkup with your doctor?

12:58.255 --> 13:00.562
Next week. Tuesday.

13:00.562 --> 13:02.346
Oh. All right.

13:05.088 --> 13:06.611
How are you holding up?

13:08.613 --> 13:10.528
I'm-- I'm worried
about my daughter.

13:10.528 --> 13:12.966
- You have a daughter?
- Yeah. Gina.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.272
Here. Yeah, she's--

13:15.272 --> 13:17.579
- Oh, she's so cute.
- She's ten now.

13:17.579 --> 13:18.928
Wow.

13:18.928 --> 13:20.625
Oh, gosh.

13:20.625 --> 13:22.366
This trial must really
be affecting her, too.

13:22.366 --> 13:24.804
It's not just that.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.545
Gina's mom and--
and her new boyfriend...

13:28.720 --> 13:30.374
they drink a lot.

13:30.374 --> 13:33.290
Yeah, I'm fighting
for custody right now.

13:33.290 --> 13:36.076
I'm just worried that
my ex is going to use

13:36.076 --> 13:38.208
all of this against me.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.298
Well, look,

13:41.298 --> 13:43.300
I'm going to make sure
that you continue

13:43.300 --> 13:45.825
to receive ongoing
medical attention.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.478
There is therapy
that's specifically

13:47.478 --> 13:50.655
tailored to organ donors.

13:50.655 --> 13:53.093
And, um,
I could see about

13:53.093 --> 13:54.790
getting some counseling
for Gina, too.

13:55.704 --> 13:57.401
- Really?
- Yeah, absolutely.

14:01.492 --> 14:03.103
Thank you.

14:03.103 --> 14:05.453
I mean, you're welcome.

14:05.453 --> 14:07.020
That would be
so good for Gina.

14:09.239 --> 14:10.850
I really appreciate your time.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.243
Thank you so much. Bye bye.

14:13.243 --> 14:14.941
Hey. So I just spoke

14:14.941 --> 14:16.551
with her old
high school principal.

14:16.551 --> 14:19.423
Apparently, she was
in detention a lot.

14:19.423 --> 14:21.121
How did it go with her parents?
Any luck?

14:21.121 --> 14:23.558
You know,
they didn't say much.

14:23.558 --> 14:25.212
They said...

14:25.212 --> 14:27.083
"We gave Anna everything
she needed.

14:27.083 --> 14:30.217
"Trips, cars, money,"
but then they cut her off.

14:30.217 --> 14:31.827
Did they say
when they cut her off?

14:31.827 --> 14:33.785
Erratic behavior,
but they didn't elaborate.

14:33.785 --> 14:35.570
They said
they tried to make it work,

14:35.570 --> 14:37.180
but they couldn't
turn it around.

14:37.180 --> 14:40.096
- So they don't talk anymore.
- All right.

14:40.096 --> 14:42.011
There's a brother
we can talk to. I can try.

14:42.011 --> 14:44.753
Yeah?
Yeah.

14:44.753 --> 14:47.495
Dr. Barkley, could you please
explain, Mr. Davis' journey

14:47.495 --> 14:49.758
- toward getting a transplant?
- Certainly.

14:49.758 --> 14:51.934
Mr. Davis had six months
left to live

14:51.934 --> 14:53.805
due to end stage
renal disease.

14:53.805 --> 14:57.287
The wait list for a kidney
transplant was at 250.

14:57.287 --> 14:59.115
And how many
transplants from that

14:59.115 --> 15:00.638
waiting list
are performed per month?

15:01.161 --> 15:03.163
Two or three.

15:03.163 --> 15:06.253
So, is it fair to say
that the waiting list

15:06.253 --> 15:08.690
was longer than Mr. Davis
life expectancy?

15:08.690 --> 15:09.909
It is.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.563
It could have ended in tragedy.

15:14.826 --> 15:16.132
No further questions.

15:16.132 --> 15:17.699
Cross examination.

15:19.135 --> 15:20.484
Are you okay?

15:20.484 --> 15:24.097
Could have ended in a tragedy.

15:25.750 --> 15:27.404
What do you mean by that,
Dr. Barkley?

15:27.404 --> 15:30.625
I mean,
Mr. Davis could have died.

15:30.625 --> 15:33.410
You seem to be
really affected by that.

15:33.410 --> 15:36.109
Sounds to me,
like, you agree

15:36.109 --> 15:38.415
with organ trafficking
practices, do you?

15:38.415 --> 15:41.244
- Objection. Argumentative.
- Sustained. Ms. Palmer--

15:41.244 --> 15:42.854
Seeing people die

15:42.854 --> 15:45.335
is part of my job,
but that never gets easy.

15:52.212 --> 15:54.605
Gabriel. Are you okay?

15:56.912 --> 15:59.001
- I sold my kidney.
- You what?

15:59.610 --> 16:01.699
I sold my kidney.

16:01.699 --> 16:03.179
But-- Okay.

16:03.179 --> 16:04.920
I just got
a small installment.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.574
I was meeting with someone
downtown at a diner

16:06.574 --> 16:08.184
to let them know
that I changed my mind,

16:08.184 --> 16:09.969
that I was no longer interested.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.536
I order coffee,
and that's when I got drudged.

16:13.624 --> 16:15.104
Why would you ever do that?

16:15.104 --> 16:18.542
I was terrified
of losing Gina.

16:18.542 --> 16:20.370
I thought that I could pay
for a good lawyer

16:20.370 --> 16:22.155
to fight for custody.

16:22.155 --> 16:24.287
Gabriel, we have
to tell Maggie.

16:24.287 --> 16:26.942
Please, no. Let me be the one
to tell Ms. Palmer.

16:28.900 --> 16:30.250
Okay.

16:31.425 --> 16:32.730
Thank you.

16:49.356 --> 16:52.011
So does Gabriel have a job?

16:52.011 --> 16:53.795
He does, but, you know,

16:53.795 --> 16:55.666
constantly switching jobs
during the pandemic

16:55.666 --> 16:57.364
just doesn't look good.

16:57.364 --> 16:59.235
I mean, the family court
looks at him as someone

16:59.235 --> 17:01.455
- who can't keep a job.
- Family court can be brutal.

17:02.195 --> 17:03.544
Why did he lie?

17:03.544 --> 17:05.067
Because if he was backing out,

17:05.067 --> 17:06.721
then that could have been
his argument.

17:06.721 --> 17:08.723
Well, he was afraid
no one would believe him.

17:08.723 --> 17:11.160
He would lose custody of Gina
if he went to prison.

17:12.640 --> 17:13.771
What did Maggie say?

17:15.208 --> 17:18.037
- I haven't told her.
- Sarah.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.951
Gabriel asked me to wait.

17:19.951 --> 17:21.910
I mean, it's his story to tell.

17:22.519 --> 17:23.999
You're an angel.

17:23.999 --> 17:25.870
You have a freaking
heart of gold.

17:25.870 --> 17:27.350
You do,
but you're risking your job

17:27.350 --> 17:30.484
for someone that you just met.

17:30.484 --> 17:33.487
Emily, this man
has been though hell.

17:33.487 --> 17:35.793
This is Brady evidence,
Sarah, okay?

17:35.793 --> 17:40.102
You are legally obligated
to disclose this information.

17:40.102 --> 17:42.887
You need to tell Maggie.
Like now.

17:44.846 --> 17:47.501
Okay. You're right.
I-- I will tell her.

17:47.501 --> 17:48.806
Good.

17:51.592 --> 17:53.985
We've pushed back
far enough already.

17:53.985 --> 17:55.509
Well, I don't think
it's that bad.

17:56.771 --> 17:59.295
- If we had...
- Maggie.

17:59.774 --> 18:01.254
Maggie!

18:01.254 --> 18:03.256
He's on interrim. Yeah...

18:03.256 --> 18:04.866
And I don't think
we're going it.

18:04.866 --> 18:07.173
The client was [indistinct].

18:07.173 --> 18:08.783
- Maggie.
- We got it--

18:08.783 --> 18:11.568
All rise, Department 802

18:11.568 --> 18:13.440
of the Superior Court
is back in session.

18:17.835 --> 18:19.098
Be seated.

18:20.795 --> 18:23.798
Do we have any housekeeping
before we bring in the jury?

18:23.798 --> 18:25.452
Yes, Your Honor.

18:25.452 --> 18:26.931
I would like to admit

18:26.931 --> 18:28.498
some newly
discovered evidence.

18:28.498 --> 18:29.934
What is the evidence?

18:29.934 --> 18:32.023
Gabriel Salas
is no victim here.

18:32.023 --> 18:36.463
His kidney wasn't taken.
He sold it voluntarily.

18:36.463 --> 18:38.856
What an interesting
and farfetched theory.

18:38.856 --> 18:42.033
The first instalment
payment is proof.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.472
Great.

18:53.958 --> 18:57.614
- Oh, sake.
- And sushi.

18:57.614 --> 18:59.094
How did you know
I wanted sushi?

18:59.094 --> 19:01.009
I don't know. Also, I thought

19:01.009 --> 19:02.663
maybe we could keep
working for a few hours.

19:03.229 --> 19:05.056
Yeah. Cool.

19:05.056 --> 19:07.189
I wasn't able to meet
with Anna's brother,

19:07.189 --> 19:09.322
but he is coming by
the office tomorrow.

19:13.021 --> 19:14.370
What are you doing?

19:16.242 --> 19:19.027
The moment that
Carl Brewer walked free,

19:19.027 --> 19:21.290
there was something in his eyes,

19:21.290 --> 19:24.032
something that
made me feel like--

19:24.032 --> 19:26.295
like I had been wrong
about him all along.

19:26.295 --> 19:29.516
You think
he was actually guilty?

19:33.476 --> 19:36.087
And are those cold cases?

19:36.087 --> 19:38.612
The same signature killing?

19:38.612 --> 19:41.789
It's possible that this man
has been doing this for years.

19:41.789 --> 19:43.660
You know
what you're saying, right?

19:43.660 --> 19:46.272
I am saying I put
a serial killer back out

19:46.272 --> 19:48.926
on the street
and now he's killed again.

19:48.926 --> 19:50.145
No.

19:53.148 --> 19:55.672
You cannot feel guilty
about this.

19:55.672 --> 19:58.240
You did an incredible job.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.111
The D.A. failed
to prove their case

20:00.111 --> 20:01.591
beyond a reasonable doubt.

20:02.462 --> 20:04.333
This-- It's a coincidence.

20:04.333 --> 20:05.465
And you know what?

20:05.465 --> 20:06.901
Even if it isn't,

20:06.901 --> 20:09.469
you are certainly not to blame.

20:12.907 --> 20:13.995
Thank you.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.262
Okay. Let's eat.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.403
Um.

20:31.926 --> 20:33.580
Would you mind
if I crash here tonight?

20:34.320 --> 20:35.451
Nightmares?

20:36.974 --> 20:38.933
I'll take the couch.
You can take my bed.

20:40.151 --> 20:42.023
Deal. I'm not going
to argue with you.

20:48.769 --> 20:51.032
Thanks for getting us
this private karaoke room, Mark.

20:51.032 --> 20:53.034
I love Robin, I do.

20:53.034 --> 20:56.167
And I never, ever meant
for any of this to happen.

20:56.167 --> 20:59.040
And now I'm worried that
he's never going to forgive me.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.520
This is the guilt talking.

21:01.825 --> 21:03.131
You...

21:04.654 --> 21:06.874
- acted on impulse--
- Yeah.

21:06.874 --> 21:09.398
During a life-threatening event.

21:09.398 --> 21:12.183
- And you acknowledge it.
- Yeah.

21:12.183 --> 21:13.924
And Robin will forgive you.

21:13.924 --> 21:17.798
But you've got to
forgive yourself first.

21:17.798 --> 21:19.756
Now who sounds like Yoda?

21:24.239 --> 21:27.155
Are you sure you really
want to get married?

21:27.895 --> 21:30.332
Yeah, I do.

21:30.332 --> 21:31.986
- Aw.
- I really do.

21:31.986 --> 21:33.901
I want to have
something different

21:33.901 --> 21:35.859
than what Vic had.

21:35.859 --> 21:37.513
You know, I want to build...

fell on me.

22:35.179 --> 22:38.574
It fell on my head.

22:38.574 --> 22:42.012
I thought it was
a gigantic spider or something.

22:42.012 --> 22:43.840

24:46.223 --> 24:48.095

<i>I know you're going
to say I told you so.</i>

25:15.252 --> 25:17.167

I tried to tell her.</i>

<i>You should have seen her face</i>

25:19.169 --> 25:21.432
<i>when she dropped the bomb.</i>
I feel for Maggie.

25:21.432 --> 25:24.740
You know, she's probably
going crazy, re-strategizing.

25:24.740 --> 25:25.872
Hey, Sara.

25:26.960 --> 25:29.353
<i>Oh, good morning, Luke.</i>

25:29.353 --> 25:30.920
Okay. Well,
you're probably busy.

25:30.920 --> 25:32.269
I'll let you go. Love you.

25:32.269 --> 25:33.967
Call you later. Goodbye.

25:33.967 --> 25:35.403
<i>"Luke and I,
we're just friends--"</i>

25:41.104 --> 25:42.453
Hey, so, um...

25:43.803 --> 25:45.326
I was thinking a little bit.

25:45.326 --> 25:47.110
Mm-hmm?

25:47.110 --> 25:50.549
And, um, I'm really used
to taking care of myself.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.115
Like, that is what I do.

25:52.899 --> 25:54.814
But maybe love...

25:56.032 --> 25:59.209
is being vulnerable and...

26:00.428 --> 26:02.865
And letting some--
someone else in.

26:02.865 --> 26:04.432
Yeah. So what are you saying?

26:04.432 --> 26:06.434
So, what I'm saying is, um...

26:07.391 --> 26:08.567
I'm saying...

26:13.354 --> 26:15.051
Luke, do you want to go
steady with me?

26:17.053 --> 26:18.707
- Yes.
- With me?

26:19.273 --> 26:20.579
Yes.

26:26.367 --> 26:28.761
Do you know if Anna
was ever bullied in school?

26:28.761 --> 26:30.414
Mmm. I wouldn't know.

26:30.414 --> 26:32.286
Anna was always acting up.

26:32.286 --> 26:34.593
Your parents call it
"erratic behavior."

26:34.593 --> 26:36.769
Yeah, but I don't--

26:36.769 --> 26:38.509
I don't think they knew
what was going on.

26:38.509 --> 26:39.946
They didn't know
how to deal with it.

26:39.946 --> 26:41.338
My parents were not the most...

26:42.209 --> 26:44.385
patient or attentive.

26:44.385 --> 26:46.039
I was fine doing my own thing.

26:46.039 --> 26:48.824
But Anna did a lot
to get their attention.

26:48.824 --> 26:51.435
You mean like fighting
in school, cutting class?

26:51.435 --> 26:54.047
Mostly stealing.
She would steal things a lot.

26:54.047 --> 26:56.179
And that pissed off my parents.

26:56.179 --> 26:57.964
We had plenty of money.

26:57.964 --> 26:59.705
She only got in a fight once,

26:59.705 --> 27:01.924
because she stole something
from another girl,

27:01.924 --> 27:05.798
then refused to go to class,
because she was so embarrassed.

27:05.798 --> 27:08.627
So, no, I don't think
this was due to bullying.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.280
Anna was always a train wreck.

27:21.944 --> 27:23.946
So good.
[indistinct].

27:23.946 --> 27:25.861
Mmm. Gonna get some more.

27:26.688 --> 27:28.081
Great cake, Mark.

27:29.473 --> 27:30.649
Okay, I'm listening.

27:34.130 --> 27:35.784
We are pushing
for mental health diversion

27:35.784 --> 27:37.177
for our client.

27:37.177 --> 27:39.701
Ms. Connolly
is a kleptomaniac.

27:39.701 --> 27:41.355
We have gone through
all of her family,

27:41.355 --> 27:43.052
medical and school history.

27:43.052 --> 27:44.750
It seems like she's been
dealing with this disorder

27:44.750 --> 27:46.316
since high school. Exactly.

27:46.316 --> 27:48.754
She lies about stealing
out of shame.

27:48.754 --> 27:50.451
She doesn't understand
why she does it.

27:50.451 --> 27:52.540
Her family certainly
didn't understand it.

27:52.540 --> 27:55.108
Look, you both know
that I can't do anything

27:55.108 --> 27:56.675
without an official diagnosis.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.198
We had her evaluated
this morning.

27:58.198 --> 27:59.808
We cannot punish her

27:59.808 --> 28:01.331
for an untreated disorder.

28:02.506 --> 28:04.987
She still committed the theft.

28:04.987 --> 28:08.164
I'll think about it
and I'll get back to you.

28:10.776 --> 28:12.038
What do you think
about that body

28:12.038 --> 28:13.256
turned up in South LA?

28:17.783 --> 28:19.175
Coincidence.

28:19.741 --> 28:21.525
- You?
- Yeah.

28:22.831 --> 28:24.180
Yeah. Coincidence.

28:25.921 --> 28:27.575
Fuck!
- What?

28:27.575 --> 28:29.664
According to these documents
Nestor sent me,

28:29.664 --> 28:32.145
Dr. Barkley had a malpractice
suit seven years ago

28:32.145 --> 28:34.408
in which she lost
all of her privileges.

28:34.408 --> 28:36.062
When Maggie finds that,

28:36.062 --> 28:37.498
she'll move to exclude
Barkley's testimony.

28:37.498 --> 28:39.195
But I don't understand.

28:39.195 --> 28:40.762
How is she doing so well?

28:40.762 --> 28:42.416
She comes to court
showing off Cartier,

28:42.416 --> 28:44.723
but she also bought
a house in Laurel Canyon

28:44.723 --> 28:45.985
only three years ago.

28:50.903 --> 28:52.600
Do you know
something about this?

28:56.604 --> 28:58.475
When I knew
I was running out of time

28:58.475 --> 29:00.086
for a kidney transplant

29:00.086 --> 29:02.305
and would most likely die...

29:04.264 --> 29:06.483
Dr. Barkley offered
to find a kidney for me.

29:06.483 --> 29:08.181
I thought you said
you purchased one

29:08.181 --> 29:09.748
off the black market.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.880
Dr. Barkley
is the black market.

29:11.880 --> 29:15.449
She has contacts that do
the dirty part of the job.

29:15.449 --> 29:18.278
- She said it usually goes well.
- Usually?

29:18.278 --> 29:20.106
So that's how
she's making her money.

29:20.106 --> 29:21.890
Trafficking organs.

29:21.890 --> 29:24.371
I put a-- an organ trafficker
on the stand

29:24.371 --> 29:26.460
and you said nothing.

29:26.460 --> 29:28.723
I have been fighting
for you to walk free.

29:28.723 --> 29:30.594
Look at it however you want to.

29:30.594 --> 29:32.031
She saved my life.

29:32.031 --> 29:33.423
I need you to leave.

29:34.250 --> 29:35.425
Now.

29:43.085 --> 29:44.173
I'm sorry.

29:55.706 --> 29:57.534
My colleague sent these to me.

29:58.971 --> 30:01.669
I knew there was something off
about Dr. Barkley.

30:01.669 --> 30:04.672
The two traffickers that
were charged are her minions.

30:04.672 --> 30:06.326
They do the organ extractions.

30:06.326 --> 30:08.458
That, along with
Damon's confession,

30:08.458 --> 30:10.591
and whatever evidence
he can provide,

30:10.591 --> 30:12.201
I mean, we have enough to start.

30:13.594 --> 30:15.726
You want immunity for Davis?

30:15.726 --> 30:19.818
Mr. Salas may have intended
to sell his organ,

30:19.818 --> 30:21.689
but he was robbed
of his autonomy

30:21.689 --> 30:23.212
when he changed his mind.

30:23.212 --> 30:25.258
Instead of sending
one guy to prison,

30:25.258 --> 30:27.434
together, we can take down

30:27.434 --> 30:29.871
an entire
organ trafficking ring.

30:31.960 --> 30:33.135
I need your help.

30:35.659 --> 30:38.184
There's a relatively recent law
here in California

30:38.184 --> 30:40.839
that allows people with certain
mental health conditions

30:40.839 --> 30:42.710
to earn a dismissal
of their case

30:42.710 --> 30:44.233
by doing treatment.

30:44.233 --> 30:46.670
- You qualify.
- Thank you.

30:46.670 --> 30:48.324
I knew something
was wrong with me

30:48.324 --> 30:50.544
and I always felt guilty

30:50.544 --> 30:52.372
for not being able
to control it.

30:52.372 --> 30:54.722
Why not seek treatment?

30:54.722 --> 30:56.332
I guess
I didn't want a diagnosis.

30:57.551 --> 30:59.727
I was dealing
with so much shame,

30:59.727 --> 31:02.208
that I didn't want it
to be real.

31:04.210 --> 31:06.212
- Yeah.
- Ooh! Ooh!

31:06.212 --> 31:07.822
I have something for you.

31:07.822 --> 31:09.519
Don't worry.
I didn't steal it.

31:10.303 --> 31:13.088
This is my hobby.

31:13.088 --> 31:14.568
Oh!

31:14.568 --> 31:16.918
And I would like you
to remember me

31:16.918 --> 31:18.485
as the girl
who knows how to crochet,

31:18.485 --> 31:20.226
not the girl who steals.

31:21.096 --> 31:23.011
These are so cute.

31:23.011 --> 31:24.795
This is exactly
how we will remember you.

31:24.795 --> 31:26.406
Good. Thank you.

31:26.406 --> 31:28.582
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

31:28.582 --> 31:30.149
Bye.

31:40.463 --> 31:42.813
Ah, 'kay.

31:42.813 --> 31:44.859
Uh, as long as
it doesn't interfere with work,

31:44.859 --> 31:46.339
I really don't care.

32:04.705 --> 32:06.881
What do you have
for me today, Counsel?

32:06.881 --> 32:08.970
Your Honor, the parties
have reached a resolution

32:08.970 --> 32:11.103
that we're hoping
the courts will allow.

32:11.103 --> 32:12.626
Can you lay out the terms?

32:12.626 --> 32:14.976
My client
deeply regrets his actions,

32:14.976 --> 32:17.936
but we have proof
that Dr. Barkley coerced him

32:17.936 --> 32:20.460
to buy the kidney
for her own benefit.

32:20.460 --> 32:22.375
She runs
an organ trafficking ring.

32:22.375 --> 32:24.943
Dr. Tanya Barkley,
your witness?

32:26.988 --> 32:29.164
Mr. Davis and Mr. Salas
have agreed to give her up

32:29.164 --> 32:32.298
in exchange for dropping
the charges against Mr. Davis.

32:32.298 --> 32:34.953
And for Mr. Salas
to not be prosecuted

32:34.953 --> 32:37.129
for initially attempting
to sell his organ.

32:38.478 --> 32:40.828
Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Salas, please stand.

32:40.828 --> 32:42.569
Are you aware that

32:42.569 --> 32:44.397
the case in which
you were the alleged victim

32:44.397 --> 32:46.007
will be dismissed
and you will not be entitled

32:46.007 --> 32:48.618
- to restitution?
- Yes, Your Honor.

32:48.618 --> 32:51.230
Mr. Davis
did not target me personally,

32:51.230 --> 32:53.797
and it's not my place
to judge him for his actions.

32:53.797 --> 32:55.147
Okay.

32:56.148 --> 32:59.542
Thank you. Mr. Davis?

32:59.542 --> 33:03.024
Are you aware of the severity
of your actions?

33:03.024 --> 33:07.463
I sincerely regret
how everything has transpired.

33:07.463 --> 33:09.770
And I--
I'm truly sorry, I--

33:13.513 --> 33:14.862
I'm sorry, Mr. Salas.

33:16.472 --> 33:18.648
Ms. Quinn, while I understand

33:18.648 --> 33:20.476
the parties have reached
a resolution,

33:20.476 --> 33:22.870
I am not willing
to dismiss this case,

33:22.870 --> 33:26.395
unless Mr. Davis
pleas to the charge.

33:26.395 --> 33:28.832
My client agrees
to the charge of a misdemeanor.

33:28.832 --> 33:30.095
As a felony.

33:31.009 --> 33:33.402
Mr. Davis can earn the dismissal

33:33.402 --> 33:36.405
by doing community service
at the Children's Hospital

33:36.405 --> 33:38.929
three times a week
for a full year.

33:41.715 --> 33:43.412
We accept your terms,
Your Honor.

33:43.412 --> 33:45.284
Very well.

33:45.284 --> 33:47.895
Dr. Barkley will be
prosecuted separately

33:47.895 --> 33:50.115
and an arrest warrant
will be out today--

33:50.115 --> 33:51.507
That won't be necessary.

33:52.291 --> 33:53.596
I'm turning myself in.

33:58.732 --> 34:01.300
You have the right to legal
representation, Dr. Barkley,

34:01.300 --> 34:03.824
but you do not need
to do this right now.

34:03.824 --> 34:07.697
The health care system
needs to do a better.

34:07.697 --> 34:10.309
And until that happens,
I've been striving to fix it,

34:10.309 --> 34:12.137
saving lives.

34:12.137 --> 34:13.355
Yes, I make money.

34:13.355 --> 34:15.096
But that money enables me

34:15.096 --> 34:16.663
to give free transplants

34:16.663 --> 34:18.056
to those
who can't afford to purchase.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.187
So...

34:20.536 --> 34:23.583
while I understand
that this is legally wrong...

34:25.324 --> 34:26.673
my heart is at peace.

34:45.866 --> 34:47.911
Did you give
Dr. Barkley a heads up?

34:49.739 --> 34:51.089
I owed her at least that.

34:53.613 --> 34:56.355
I hope you live
a good, long life, Damon.

34:56.355 --> 34:57.921
You too, Ms. Quinn.

34:57.921 --> 34:59.619
I hope you have
the life you dreamed of.

35:00.837 --> 35:02.100
It could be gone
in an instant.

35:05.886 --> 35:07.409
I'm sorry for not being honest

35:07.409 --> 35:09.194
with you and Miss Palmer
from the beginning.

35:09.194 --> 35:13.198
Again, I have no words
to thank you.

35:13.198 --> 35:15.939
Well, I'm--
I'm just so glad it's over.

35:15.939 --> 35:18.028
And now you can focus
on getting your daughter back.

35:18.028 --> 35:21.728
Yes, um, can I buy you
a cup of coffee sometime?

35:21.728 --> 35:23.469
Please. I owe you.

35:23.469 --> 35:26.124
Oh, um, yeah.

35:26.124 --> 35:28.996
- Yeah, sure.
- Great. Uh, I'll be in touch.

35:28.996 --> 35:31.216
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

35:33.479 --> 35:34.610
You knew.

35:35.742 --> 35:37.004
I-- I did.

35:37.004 --> 35:39.137
Just for, like, a hot second.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.573
And you didn't come forward?

35:40.573 --> 35:42.227
Well, I was going to.

35:42.227 --> 35:44.098
You withheld
information from me.

35:44.098 --> 35:46.709
- Okay, let me just clarify--
- Justify, you mean.

35:47.971 --> 35:50.148
I don't forget disloyalty,
Miss Castillo.

35:57.590 --> 36:00.854
This case made me feel
so lucky, you know?

36:00.854 --> 36:03.596
Lucky that Bailey
and Robin are healthy.

36:03.596 --> 36:07.339
Lucky I had good insurance
to have a good birth.

36:07.339 --> 36:09.384
Isn't it terrifying that
we consider ourselves lucky

36:09.384 --> 36:10.777
when our basic rights

36:10.777 --> 36:12.605
- are being met?
- Agreed.

36:12.605 --> 36:14.650
I mean, both the victim
and the defendant's actions

36:14.650 --> 36:17.262
were the result of a failure
of our system.

36:18.088 --> 36:20.221
Speaking of...

36:20.221 --> 36:22.397
did you convince your dad
to go to the doctor?

36:24.007 --> 36:27.010
Henry Park
is a stubborn man,

36:27.010 --> 36:28.664
but I will get there.

36:30.579 --> 36:33.582
Park, not Kansky?

36:33.582 --> 36:37.238
I told you my parents were
in a mobile home community.

36:38.152 --> 36:39.936
But the truth is...

36:41.460 --> 36:44.158
I grew up on a commune.

36:44.158 --> 36:46.465
Growing up in a commune is...

36:47.596 --> 36:50.033
It's a layered experience.

36:50.033 --> 36:53.036
Getting out
was the hardest thing

36:53.036 --> 36:54.342
I've ever had to do.

36:55.604 --> 36:58.259
So I changed my last name...

36:59.608 --> 37:00.696
when I left.

37:13.405 --> 37:15.711
- Who's this?
- Anna Kansky.

37:15.711 --> 37:19.062
She's the first female chemist
to go to university.

37:19.062 --> 37:21.456
I promised myself

37:21.456 --> 37:23.110
I would do the same.

37:23.110 --> 37:25.373
Become the first woman
to leave my commune

37:25.373 --> 37:26.722
and go to college.

37:29.682 --> 37:31.597
It will be all right
with your dad.

37:33.860 --> 37:35.253
Thank you.

37:41.650 --> 37:44.740
It will be all right with Robin.

38:09.374 --> 38:10.810
Hey, what is all this?

38:11.376 --> 38:12.725
Samples.

38:12.725 --> 38:14.248
For the wedding.

38:14.248 --> 38:15.771
I thought
I was planning the wedding.

38:15.771 --> 38:16.903
You know what I realized?

38:18.339 --> 38:20.167
Guilt is a bully.

38:22.125 --> 38:23.692
Makes us do things
we don't want to do

38:23.692 --> 38:26.347
and it makes us
punish ourselves.

38:26.347 --> 38:28.175
Guilt told me
I was a terrible person

38:28.175 --> 38:30.046
for leaving Collier alone, for...

38:31.091 --> 38:32.266
not being able to love him...

38:33.180 --> 38:34.312
the way I used to.

38:35.269 --> 38:36.966
It told me...

38:36.966 --> 38:38.707
I couldn't have
a second wedding, that...

38:39.926 --> 38:41.144
That I didn't deserve you.

38:43.364 --> 38:46.280
But, this case, Damon...

38:48.891 --> 38:50.197
I need to live my life.

38:51.633 --> 38:53.331
And the life
that I want is with you.

39:00.860 --> 39:02.731
It's okay to miss him.

39:04.167 --> 39:05.299
He was a...

39:07.432 --> 39:08.650
He was a really good guy.

39:10.260 --> 39:12.567
And I'm so happy

39:12.567 --> 39:14.656
that you have that chapter
of your life with him.

39:17.311 --> 39:20.488
We all process grief
in different ways.

39:22.969 --> 39:25.580
But I need you to know
that you can let it out, okay?

39:33.022 --> 39:35.808
- Please try some.
- That looks really delicious.

39:37.200 --> 39:39.681
- But I am so hungover.
- Oh!

39:39.681 --> 39:43.032
I am so, so hungover.

39:43.032 --> 39:44.643
Oh. Please don't puke on me.

39:44.643 --> 39:47.428
I think I might.
