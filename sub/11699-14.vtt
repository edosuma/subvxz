00:00.437 --> 00:03.690
No, of course, Rachel. I'd
love to come over tonight.

00:03.691 --> 00:05.939
As long as it's ok that I
bring another girl with me.

00:07.660 --> 00:08.949
Rachel?

00:10.086 --> 00:11.280
Rachel?

00:11.981 --> 00:14.293
Well, you've done it again!

00:18.730 --> 00:20.558
What, did I unleash the Kraken?

00:25.469 --> 00:26.707
No.

00:26.708 --> 00:28.151
I was getting ready for bed,

00:28.152 --> 00:30.912
and my water and power were shut off.

00:30.913 --> 00:33.359
You know you have to pay
your bills every month, right?

00:34.145 --> 00:35.807
Kind of part of being a grown-up.

00:36.550 --> 00:38.318
As is trusting your son,

00:38.319 --> 00:41.207
who promised to run your
bills down to the mailbox,

00:41.208 --> 00:43.543
while you babysat his child.

00:43.889 --> 00:46.109
There's a mailbox near here? Where?

00:47.386 --> 00:49.912
And the worst part is I was one click away

00:49.913 --> 00:52.275
from getting tickets
to Bon Jovi this weekend

00:52.276 --> 00:53.904
at Madison Square Garden.

00:54.281 --> 00:56.859
All I heard was "I'm free
to babysit this weekend."

00:58.378 --> 01:00.585
You know what... I'm done.

01:00.921 --> 01:03.565
I am tired of being taken for granted.

01:03.566 --> 01:05.800
The next time you need a sitter, an alibi,

01:05.801 --> 01:08.104
or a kidney, you can call somebody else.

01:09.645 --> 01:12.418
Until I feel like I am being appreciated,

01:12.419 --> 01:14.411
you will not be seeing me again.

01:18.572 --> 01:20.029
Right after I use your shower,

01:20.030 --> 01:21.669
your sink, and your toothbrush.

01:34.373 --> 01:36.983
Ben has gotta fix this mom strike.

01:36.984 --> 01:38.268
It's been three days.

01:38.582 --> 01:39.652
Look at this.

01:40.337 --> 01:42.937
No match. No match.

01:42.938 --> 01:44.161
No match.

01:44.683 --> 01:47.626
My sock situation's a
complete disaster, man.

01:48.806 --> 01:51.322
Okay. I think Emma's finally ready.

01:54.237 --> 01:55.648
Is that my towel?

01:56.614 --> 01:58.951
Well, it was either that
or the shower curtain.

01:59.477 --> 02:01.040
And that affects all of us.

02:02.738 --> 02:05.685
Ben, you have to do
something about your mom.

02:05.686 --> 02:07.349
I know, I tried.

02:07.350 --> 02:08.608
I apologized.

02:09.033 --> 02:11.419
I even promised her it
would never happen again.

02:11.420 --> 02:13.530
But mom can always tell when I'm lying.

02:14.533 --> 02:16.307
Oh, my God. You guys
aren't going to believe it.

02:17.996 --> 02:19.346
I'm going to prom.

02:21.353 --> 02:22.873
Just so you know,

02:22.874 --> 02:25.967
dating a high-school guy
at your age is creepy.

02:27.318 --> 02:30.488
Also a little bit
desperate. But mostly creepy.

02:31.318 --> 02:32.208
No.

02:32.209 --> 02:35.324
I'm on the alumni committee,
and they asked me to chaperone.

02:35.325 --> 02:37.966
And it is going to be awesome.

02:38.424 --> 02:40.245
I always wanted to go to prom.

02:40.246 --> 02:42.044
No. No, you didn't.

02:42.045 --> 02:45.273
All you did was mock prom and anybody
who had anything to do with it.

02:45.274 --> 02:47.114
I didn't ask to be elected king.

02:48.367 --> 02:49.910
The people demanded it.

02:51.144 --> 02:54.720
I'm sorry, but mocking was
one of my defense mechanisms.

02:54.721 --> 02:56.156
I thought it was eating.

02:57.983 --> 02:59.853
You know, some people just go

02:59.854 --> 03:02.283
and keep telling everyone
their date's in the bathroom.

03:04.687 --> 03:07.244
I'm just offering it as an option.

03:08.389 --> 03:10.064
Well, lucky for me,

03:10.065 --> 03:11.895
I still have my old prom dress.

03:11.896 --> 03:14.288
You know, the one I bought in
the hopes that a certain someone

03:14.289 --> 03:16.553
who had been ignoring me
all through high school

03:16.554 --> 03:18.085
would finally ask me.

03:22.399 --> 03:25.328
- I'm sorry, were you saying something?
- I was answering a text.

03:27.023 --> 03:29.983
So all I have to do now
is just have it taken in.

03:33.060 --> 03:35.119
Oh, my God! Or you could
just use the leftovers

03:35.120 --> 03:38.179
and make some play
clothes for the children.

03:40.561 --> 03:41.918
"Sound of Music"?

03:42.758 --> 03:45.085
Oh, come on, people. It's a classic.

03:46.394 --> 03:48.076
Well, I'm glad you're going.

03:48.077 --> 03:50.273
Maybe I could take you this
time. You shouldn't go alone.

03:50.274 --> 03:52.130
Oh, no. I'm not.

03:52.131 --> 03:53.381
Philip's taking me.

03:53.382 --> 03:55.087
He's actually flying in
early from his conference

03:55.088 --> 03:57.588
in Boston just so he can be my date.

03:58.990 --> 04:00.465
That's right, people.

04:00.466 --> 04:01.910
I have a boyfriend.

04:03.428 --> 04:05.123
And I'm going to prom.

04:09.446 --> 04:10.582
Oh, cool.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.697
Bon Jovi added a second show at the Garden.

04:12.698 --> 04:14.545
Practice is canceled tomorrow.

04:14.546 --> 04:15.771
Oh, my God, really?

04:15.772 --> 04:17.228
That's how I can make
things right with mom.

04:17.230 --> 04:19.125
I can get her front row seats to Bon Jovi.

04:19.125 --> 04:21.676
Good luck 'cause you're going
to have to camp out overnight

04:21.677 --> 04:22.919
to get those kinds of seats.

04:22.920 --> 04:24.215
Oh, my God. I'm in.

04:26.825 --> 04:29.104
What are you talking about?
You don't even like bon Jovi.

04:29.105 --> 04:31.464
I know. I've just always
wanted to go camping.

04:36.001 --> 04:38.245
Where do you think we can
get our hands on a tent?

04:40.000 --> 04:46.074

04:48.592 --> 04:50.132
This is the life, isn't it?

04:50.836 --> 04:52.941
You know, this must be how our ancestors

04:52.942 --> 04:54.796
waited in line for tickets.

04:56.396 --> 04:57.790
Marshmallow?

04:59.388 --> 05:01.302
Oh, my God. Ben, are you okay?

05:02.038 --> 05:04.351
Are you kidding me?

05:04.746 --> 05:08.213
This is your "emergency 911"?

05:08.214 --> 05:10.011
What, you wanted me to
hold your place in line

05:10.012 --> 05:11.172
while you peed?

05:12.013 --> 05:14.142
I'm sorry, mom. I just wanted
to see the look on your face

05:14.143 --> 05:16.609
when I tell you I'm first
in line for your forgiveness.

05:16.610 --> 05:19.068
A.K.A. Bon Jovi tickets.

05:19.069 --> 05:20.848
Oh, my God. Ben, really?

05:20.849 --> 05:22.737
- Yeah.
- Oh, I'm...

05:22.738 --> 05:24.719
I'm so touched. See?

05:24.720 --> 05:26.372
This is what I'm talking about.

05:26.373 --> 05:29.459
Making our relationship a two-way street.

05:29.460 --> 05:30.619
I'm glad you're happy.

05:30.620 --> 05:32.164
But when you call this a relationship,

05:32.165 --> 05:33.507
it makes me queasy.

05:34.027 --> 05:36.066
Oh, and Ben, when you get the seats,

05:36.067 --> 05:37.980
I like to be a little off to the side.

05:37.981 --> 05:40.200
You know, so I get a good
view of those dimples.

05:40.201 --> 05:41.948
And I'm not talking about the ones...

05:41.949 --> 05:43.677
I know what you're talking about.

05:57.692 --> 05:58.885
<i>I'll take anything.</i>

05:58.886 --> 06:00.407
Nosebleeds, ear bleeds...

06:00.408 --> 06:02.092
if I don't get tickets, I'll bleed.

06:03.717 --> 06:05.215
Oh, this is good.

06:05.216 --> 06:08.395
- You found seats?
- No, they changed the hold music.

06:11.468 --> 06:13.422
Tucker, man, what am I going to do?

06:13.423 --> 06:14.474
Hey, Benji.

06:14.475 --> 06:16.346
I just talked to Janice
from the old neighborhood.

06:16.347 --> 06:19.123
And I told her that I had
two tickets to Bon Jovi.

06:19.124 --> 06:21.615
And that she can suck it,

06:21.616 --> 06:24.193
because I am bringing my favorite son.

06:26.893 --> 06:29.116
Whoa, mom, there's been a little hitch

06:29.117 --> 06:30.274
in our giddy-up.

06:30.275 --> 06:31.918
A what in
our who-dy-up?

06:31.919 --> 06:33.528
What Ben is trying to say

06:33.529 --> 06:35.593
is that the seats aren't in the first row.

06:35.594 --> 06:37.328
They're in the third.

06:37.329 --> 06:38.788
They are?

06:38.789 --> 06:40.370
They are. I'm sorry.

06:40.371 --> 06:42.416
Oh! No, no. That's fine.

06:42.734 --> 06:44.246
Oh, my God, Benji!

06:44.247 --> 06:45.602
I am so excited!

06:46.407 --> 06:48.613
Oh, I'm going to go
find my easy-lift shirts

06:48.614 --> 06:50.470
so I can flash Jon a special message...

06:50.471 --> 06:51.918
if you know what I mean.

06:52.507 --> 06:54.129
Again, I know.

06:55.768 --> 06:58.554
Tucker, you're a life-saver.
How did you get those tickets?

06:58.555 --> 06:59.770
Charisma.

07:01.297 --> 07:03.519
My aunt Charisma's a ticket scalper.

07:07.297 --> 07:10.083
Well, I've been stood up for prom.

07:10.726 --> 07:12.725
My life is officially over!

07:14.675 --> 07:16.455
There's a horrible storm in Boston

07:16.456 --> 07:18.438
and all of the planes have been grounded.

07:18.882 --> 07:20.428
Lamest boyfriend ever.

07:24.322 --> 07:26.253
Aww, but Cinder-Riley,

07:26.254 --> 07:28.128
you have to go to the ball.

07:33.005 --> 07:34.210
No, obviously,

07:34.211 --> 07:36.181
I am just not meant to go to prom.

07:38.222 --> 07:40.850
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

07:44.020 --> 07:45.778
Oh, my God. Danny.

07:46.726 --> 07:48.114
What are you doing?

07:48.115 --> 07:50.147
Well, Philip called, and
he wanted me to make sure

07:50.148 --> 07:51.452
that you were okay.

07:51.453 --> 07:52.989
I thought I could do better.

07:52.990 --> 07:54.316
Corsage?

07:55.952 --> 07:57.689
This is just about the sweetest thing

07:57.690 --> 07:59.685
anyone has ever done for me.

08:00.166 --> 08:03.115
Philip is just the best boyfriend ever.

08:04.681 --> 08:07.238
Yeah, he's great. But we
should probably get moving.

08:07.239 --> 08:08.577
All right.

08:08.578 --> 08:10.566
Bye, Tucker. Don't wait up.

08:10.567 --> 08:12.241
Oh, I won't. You know.

08:12.242 --> 08:14.513
- Mostly because I have a date.
- With Emma.

08:14.514 --> 08:16.257
Oh, come on. She didn't have to know that.

08:21.420 --> 08:23.515
Hey, Ben. Hey, how are the seats?

08:23.516 --> 08:25.042
Oh, yeah. They're great.

08:25.043 --> 08:26.699
Except they're a little far from the stage.

08:27.746 --> 08:29.776
Those tickets were fakes, dude.

08:29.777 --> 08:31.209
We've been arrested.

08:39.597 --> 08:40.827
Really, Ben?

08:40.828 --> 08:42.159
Fake tickets?

08:42.160 --> 08:43.557
We could go to jail.

08:43.897 --> 08:46.276
Mom, don't worry. I'll straighten
everything out with the guard.

08:46.706 --> 08:49.208
But just in case, you are wearing
that easy-lift shirt, right?

08:49.209 --> 08:50.487
Duh.

08:51.337 --> 08:53.895
Excuse me, officer.
There's been a huge mistake.

08:53.896 --> 08:56.218
What? Coming to a concert with fake tickets

08:56.219 --> 08:58.179
or coming to a concert with your mommy?

08:58.180 --> 08:59.723
Hey, hey... huh?

09:00.286 --> 09:02.318
Look, she's the biggest
Bon Jovi fan in the world.

09:02.319 --> 09:04.837
She once sat outside of
his house for three days.

09:04.838 --> 09:07.613
And that's only because she
couldn't scale a 15-foot wall.

09:08.122 --> 09:09.666
Wall? Please.

09:09.667 --> 09:10.954
It was an electric fence.

09:10.955 --> 09:12.704
And I still got a bald
spot in the back of my head.

09:13.930 --> 09:16.363
Sir, look at this face.

09:17.141 --> 09:18.637
That is the face of innocence.

09:19.102 --> 09:21.150
And the best mom in the world.

09:21.151 --> 09:23.740
And I know, behind the
cold steel of that badge,

09:23.741 --> 09:25.303
there's a heart in there somewhere.

09:25.658 --> 09:27.459
So please, I beg of you.

09:27.460 --> 09:29.453
Punish me twice, and let this amazing,

09:29.876 --> 09:31.662
selfless woman go.

09:33.532 --> 09:35.360
Hey, hey. I've got a mom too.

09:35.850 --> 09:37.512
And I'd do anything for her.

09:38.698 --> 09:40.400
Oh, you both can go.

09:40.401 --> 09:42.394
Really? Thank you!

09:42.395 --> 09:43.903
Oh, my God. I love you, huh?

09:44.409 --> 09:45.387
Mm...

09:46.951 --> 09:49.250
Oh, where do you think you're going?

09:49.251 --> 09:50.662
Oh, no, no. It's okay.

09:50.663 --> 09:52.102
He's letting us go.

09:52.103 --> 09:54.501
And perhaps calling me later.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.118
Well, it's going to be his one phone call.

09:58.119 --> 09:59.714
'Cause that bag of nuts is in here

09:59.715 --> 10:01.600
for impersonating an officer.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.374
Riley, calm down. You look fine.

10:14.375 --> 10:15.629
I do not look fine.

10:16.576 --> 10:18.102
I do not look fine.

10:18.103 --> 10:19.928
I tore my dress on the limo,

10:19.929 --> 10:21.445
and I spilled wine all down the front.

10:21.446 --> 10:23.920
And there are just, oh,
a dozen sparkly hairpins

10:23.921 --> 10:26.227
scattered all across
the New Jersey turnpike.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.871
Well, I guess there's always
a chance of that happening

10:28.872 --> 10:31.478
when you stick your head out of
the sunroof at 70 Miles an hour

10:31.479 --> 10:34.097
and scream, "I'm going to prom, bitches!"

10:35.939 --> 10:37.436
Perrin.

10:38.028 --> 10:39.672
Where have you been?

10:39.673 --> 10:41.766
You look like one of
those after-prom pictures

10:41.767 --> 10:43.749
we use to warn girls not to drink too much

10:43.750 --> 10:45.754
and give it up in the back of a limo.

10:47.074 --> 10:50.791
Oh, is that Danny Wheeler?

10:51.239 --> 10:52.927
Hello, vice principal Peters.

10:53.693 --> 10:55.734
Oh, please, Daniel. You are an adult now.

10:55.735 --> 10:57.591
You may call me Darlene.

10:58.989 --> 11:00.857
And now you're legal... oh!

11:04.083 --> 11:06.613
Okay, all right. Well, we're
just going to go into the dance

11:06.614 --> 11:08.228
and start chaperoning, okay?

11:08.229 --> 11:10.448
So see you under the disco ball, Darlene.

11:10.449 --> 11:12.758
Oh, no. You can hang up your dancing shoes.

11:12.759 --> 11:14.467
You're on duty in the girls' bathroom

11:14.468 --> 11:16.506
- for the first hour.
- What?

11:16.507 --> 11:17.773
Why?

11:18.604 --> 11:20.114
What happens in there?

11:21.571 --> 11:23.617
Well, if you'd gone to prom the first time

11:23.618 --> 11:26.057
like a normal person, you'd know.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.376
I kind of used to have a crush on her.

11:34.466 --> 11:36.936
Okay, so, I think I'm going to go with...

11:36.937 --> 11:38.950
things couldn't get any worse, all right?

11:38.951 --> 11:40.775
So I'm just going to go into the bathroom

11:40.776 --> 11:42.369
and serve my sentence.

11:42.370 --> 11:45.167
And then we will hit the dance floor.

11:48.348 --> 11:50.411
Right after we bail your mom

11:50.412 --> 11:53.109
and Ben out of Bon Jovi jail.

11:58.287 --> 11:59.962
Thank you for coming to my rescue.

11:59.963 --> 12:01.530
You were amazing in there.

12:01.531 --> 12:03.135
Yeah, well, three years of law school...

12:03.136 --> 12:04.641
I was talking to Danny.

12:05.315 --> 12:06.639
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa, mom.

12:06.640 --> 12:08.867
You've lost the right to
ever call me that again.

12:08.868 --> 12:10.519
No. You are not going to
believe what I just did.

12:10.520 --> 12:12.090
Whatever it is, undo it.

12:12.091 --> 12:13.642
I do work here, you know.

12:13.643 --> 12:15.959
Now, if you'll excuse us,
we gotta get back to prom.

12:15.960 --> 12:17.573
Oh, no, Danny. I don't think so.

12:17.574 --> 12:19.418
I'm kind of over it.

12:19.419 --> 12:22.418
Yeah. I was wondering why you
didn't make more of an effort.

12:23.881 --> 12:26.745
We have to go back. You've wanted
this night your entire life.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.692
Plus, it's been like an hour
since you spilled on yourself,

12:29.693 --> 12:31.924
and your hair is starting to settle.

12:33.227 --> 12:35.605
I mean, we do have the limo until midnight.

12:36.396 --> 12:38.809
Okay. Okay, okay. Let's go.

12:39.236 --> 12:41.132
Okay, now will you listen to me?

12:41.133 --> 12:43.500
No, I just added that to my list of things

12:43.501 --> 12:45.871
never to do again. Sorry!

12:46.361 --> 12:47.480
There you guys are.

12:47.481 --> 12:50.633
Do you have any idea how
many 40-something fake blondes

12:50.634 --> 12:53.717
wearing age-inappropriate
clothing are running around here?

12:53.718 --> 12:55.798
God, it's a cougar-con.

12:56.418 --> 12:57.665
Tucker, what the hell?

12:57.666 --> 12:59.282
Why are you out in the middle
of the night with my baby?

12:59.283 --> 13:02.147
Because Emma and I just scored your mom

13:02.148 --> 13:04.931
the last available ticket to Bon Jovi.

13:05.444 --> 13:07.515
Yeah, it's in the balcony,

13:07.826 --> 13:09.636
and behind a pillar, and
the show's almost over...

13:09.637 --> 13:11.617
but, look, I just wanted you to know

13:11.618 --> 13:14.114
how truly sorry I am
about the fake tickets.

13:14.469 --> 13:16.238
See?

13:16.239 --> 13:18.925
Now, that is how you apologize.

13:18.926 --> 13:20.182
Thank you, Tucker.

13:20.183 --> 13:21.920
Yes, thank you, Tucker.

13:21.921 --> 13:23.414
For nothing.

13:23.415 --> 13:25.939
Because my mom will be
backstage meeting Bon Jovi

13:25.940 --> 13:28.120
with her all-access pass.

13:28.121 --> 13:29.856
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

13:40.086 --> 13:42.128
Oh, my God! Where did you get these?!

13:42.129 --> 13:43.953
I swiped them off the
security captain's desk.

13:43.954 --> 13:46.041
And I know it's illegal, but dare I say...

13:46.042 --> 13:47.912
I was "Living on a Prayer."

13:47.913 --> 13:49.526
Oh, Benjamin Wheeler,
you are the most devious

13:49.527 --> 13:51.441
little criminal that a
mother could ever love.

13:51.751 --> 13:53.653
See ya, Tucket-master.

13:53.654 --> 13:54.958
Yeah!

13:55.499 --> 13:57.253
Oh, yeah!

14:01.933 --> 14:04.460
What happened to those
fake backstage passes

14:04.461 --> 14:05.816
we confiscated?

14:08.316 --> 14:09.382
Well, Emma,

14:09.739 --> 14:11.524
I would hate to think I hauled your ass

14:11.525 --> 14:15.065
out of your crib for nothing. I know. So...

14:15.522 --> 14:18.793
What do you say we use this ticket

14:18.794 --> 14:21.961
and take you to see your first concert?

14:23.249 --> 14:25.153
I know! Here you go.

14:27.894 --> 14:29.235
What? No...

14:29.236 --> 14:30.986
that was a fake too?

14:30.987 --> 14:33.211
God! It's getting so you can't trust people

14:33.212 --> 14:36.103
selling stuff out of their
cars in a dark alley anymore.

14:37.113 --> 14:39.478
Section 342, seat 88.

14:39.479 --> 14:40.871
It's your lucky day.

14:40.872 --> 14:43.848
You just won a backstage pass for
a meet-and-greet with Jon Bon Jovi

14:43.849 --> 14:47.086
because we put the "fan" in "fantastic."

14:47.554 --> 14:49.328
Oh, my God! This is so great!

14:49.661 --> 14:51.876
Wait, wait, wait... just so we're clear,

14:52.306 --> 14:55.577
is Bon Jovi a guy or a band?

14:57.254 --> 14:58.318
I don't know either.

15:00.916 --> 15:03.357
Hello, Jon Bon Jovi fan club members.

15:03.358 --> 15:05.955
It is me, your president.

15:05.956 --> 15:08.046
And, in just a few moments,

15:08.352 --> 15:11.836
I will be meeting the man himself.

15:11.837 --> 15:14.193
I'm going to have him autograph here,

15:14.194 --> 15:16.629
here, and a mystery body part

15:16.630 --> 15:19.471
to be named later... My boobs.

15:20.346 --> 15:21.415
Hey, I'm Ben.

15:21.416 --> 15:23.500
- And I like to party.
- Yeah, nobody cares. Nobody cares.

15:23.501 --> 15:26.401
Okay, not everyone can get back here.

15:26.402 --> 15:29.159
It is very exclusive.

15:29.160 --> 15:31.175
Oh, hey, what's up, Mrs. Wheeler?

15:31.176 --> 15:33.051
Tucker, what are you doing here?

15:33.052 --> 15:34.617
Oh, that ticket nobody wanted

15:34.618 --> 15:37.140
got us a backstage pass too.

15:38.964 --> 15:41.699
Oh... except mine doesn't say

15:42.001 --> 15:44.384
"Madison Square Jarden."

15:46.210 --> 15:47.735
Okay, people...

15:47.736 --> 15:50.625
Mr. Bon Jovi will be here any minute.

15:50.626 --> 15:52.616
We've got some counterfeits out there.

15:52.617 --> 15:55.041
<i>So I'll be double-checking
everyone's passes</i>

15:55.042 --> 15:57.186
and throwing out a few asses.

16:00.906 --> 16:03.633
Yes! We made it.

16:03.634 --> 16:04.974
That limo really flew.

16:04.975 --> 16:06.727
So much better with me driving, right?

16:06.728 --> 16:09.295
- Yeah.
- Wait, door's closing? No, no, no!

16:09.296 --> 16:10.917
No, no, no, no! Door's closing?

16:10.918 --> 16:13.116
Oh, my God... I've been waiting seven years

16:13.117 --> 16:14.605
to wear this dress!

16:15.708 --> 16:17.956
Wait, it can't be over.

16:17.957 --> 16:19.705
We'll get the band to
play a few more songs.

16:24.009 --> 16:26.087
Well, we'll at least get our picture taken

16:26.088 --> 16:27.510
by the balloon arch.

16:31.414 --> 16:35.255
Danny, I so appreciate what
you're trying to do here.

16:35.256 --> 16:38.676
But it's over. Just let it go.

16:38.677 --> 16:40.697
Okay. Well, we'll start
planning for next year.

16:40.698 --> 16:41.989
Come on.

16:41.990 --> 16:43.568
I thought this was a dream of yours.

16:43.569 --> 16:45.949
Well, some dreams don't come true.

16:46.338 --> 16:47.705
You know, and that's fine.

16:47.706 --> 16:49.971
I mean, it was silly anyway.

16:49.972 --> 16:53.067
I thought if I could just dance
under that giant disco ball

16:53.068 --> 16:56.669
to my favorite song, I could
erase who I was back then.

16:57.180 --> 17:00.548
You know, the girl that
nobody wanted to take to prom.

17:01.313 --> 17:02.600
It's fine.

17:02.953 --> 17:04.905
I think it's time that I just moved on.

17:06.565 --> 17:08.117
Just give my mom the pass.

17:08.873 --> 17:10.163
No, I'm good.

17:10.164 --> 17:11.213
Tucker!

17:11.708 --> 17:14.558
Look at that face. That
is the biggest Bon Jovi fan

17:14.559 --> 17:16.421
and the best mom in the world.

17:16.422 --> 17:19.356
And I know, behind the cold
plastic of that backstage pass,

17:19.357 --> 17:21.056
there's a heart in there somewhere.

17:21.057 --> 17:22.834
So please, I beg of you,

17:22.835 --> 17:26.626
let this amazing, selfless
woman see Bon Jovi.

17:27.912 --> 17:29.407
That sounds rehearsed.

17:29.408 --> 17:30.556
Yeah.

17:31.136 --> 17:32.954
I will babysit for the next month.

17:33.341 --> 17:34.910
She's your baby.

17:39.502 --> 17:42.292
Fine. Here's the pass.

17:42.293 --> 17:44.163
Oh! Thank you, thank you, thank you,

17:44.164 --> 17:46.025
thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!

17:46.026 --> 17:49.255
You know I do think of you
as a second mom, so come here.

17:49.256 --> 17:51.568
Oh, Ben, you really are the best son ever.

17:52.375 --> 17:53.955
And I really do love you, mom.

17:54.325 --> 17:55.936
Now do what you gotta do.

17:55.937 --> 17:57.053
Okay.

17:57.435 --> 17:59.601
These two hoodlums have fake passes.

18:00.021 --> 18:01.403
Take these two out.

18:02.550 --> 18:03.888
Aw, come on.

18:03.889 --> 18:06.314
Wait... come on. Can I at
least get a couple shrimp?

18:07.921 --> 18:10.031
All right, everyone, listen up.

18:10.584 --> 18:13.763
Mr. Bon Jovi will be here any minute.

18:13.764 --> 18:15.310
Yeah!

18:16.790 --> 18:18.972
Sorry.

18:20.528 --> 18:22.701
He's just catching a quick shower.

18:23.681 --> 18:25.711
So you're saying he's naked?

18:27.070 --> 18:28.191
Alone?

18:28.905 --> 18:30.891
In his dressing room?

18:30.892 --> 18:31.991
Yeah.

18:31.992 --> 18:33.469
But it didn't sound quite so dirty

18:33.470 --> 18:35.152
when it came out of my mouth.

18:35.961 --> 18:37.885
You know what... I'm just going to duck out

18:37.886 --> 18:39.452
for like two seconds.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.062
Mr. Bon Jo...

19:09.256 --> 19:10.547
No.

19:10.548 --> 19:12.737
No no no no no!

19:12.738 --> 19:14.181
Oh, Jon!

19:14.182 --> 19:15.900
Jon! Jon!

19:15.901 --> 19:17.733
Hey! Over here.

19:17.734 --> 19:20.705
It's me. Bonnie Wheeler.

19:20.706 --> 19:24.082
I'm the one who
short-circuited your fence.

19:28.904 --> 19:30.933
Is everything okay? Is
something wrong with Emma?

19:30.934 --> 19:32.679
No. She's fine.

19:32.680 --> 19:34.104
It's you I was worried about.

19:34.105 --> 19:36.095
Oh, Danny. I'm fine.

19:37.346 --> 19:39.249
Why are you still in your tux?

19:40.332 --> 19:43.090
Because I don't believe
in giving up on dreams.

19:47.081 --> 19:48.912
Oh, my God. Danny.

19:48.913 --> 19:50.601
This is so sweet, but...

19:50.602 --> 19:52.013
I'm not finished.

19:58.897 --> 20:00.559
I don't know what to say.

20:00.560 --> 20:02.609
Say you'll dance with me.

20:02.610 --> 20:05.412
Wait, I almost forgot
the most important part.

20:11.197 --> 20:13.901
That is not the most important part.

20:16.397 --> 20:19.146
You always being there for me is.

20:20.690 --> 20:25.636
<i>* I'll run with you forever *</i>

20:25.637 --> 20:28.477
you really are the best friend
a girl could ever ask for.

20:29.411 --> 20:34.369
<i>* As long a race as we have... *</i>

20:40.990 --> 20:43.515
Honestly, Jon was just as charming

20:43.516 --> 20:46.404
and good-looking... and,
dare I say, handsy...

20:47.351 --> 20:49.401
as I ever imagined him to be.

20:49.402 --> 20:51.088
I'm just so gosh-darn disappointed

20:51.089 --> 20:52.442
he wouldn't pose for pictures.

20:52.930 --> 20:55.049
Really? No pictures? I got a ton.

20:55.050 --> 20:56.330
- What?
- Yeah, yeah.

20:56.331 --> 20:58.443
As we were being kicked out,
we ran into Jon in the hallway.

20:58.444 --> 20:59.521
He thought Emma was so cute.

20:59.522 --> 21:01.163
He wanted to take a photo
with his youngest fan. Here.

21:01.505 --> 21:03.596
He kissed Emma on the cheek?

21:04.000 --> 21:06.076
Oh, my God. That means if I kiss her,

21:06.077 --> 21:07.893
I'm actually kissing him.

21:07.894 --> 21:09.020
Where is that baby?

21:09.021 --> 21:10.610
I will never go on strike again!

21:10.611 --> 21:11.809
Emma!

21:14.395 --> 21:15.952
God, I love Photoshop.
