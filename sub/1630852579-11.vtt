A mysterious underground temple

00:03.375 --> 00:05.833
that holds
gigantic stone coffins.

00:05.958 --> 00:07.667
It's humungous.

00:07.833 --> 00:10.000
You can walk underneath it.

00:10.167 --> 00:12.625

the heavenly rock ship.

NARRATOR:
Ancient engineering feats
far ahead of their time.

00:25.333 --> 00:28.875
Someone or some ones had
extraordinary knowledge here.

00:29.042 --> 00:32.167

-No.

On <i>Ancient Aliens,</i>
we've traveled to many

00:35.542 --> 00:39.500
mysterious sites that
seem to defy explanation.

00:39.625 --> 00:43.958
Now we take a look back
at some of the most incredible

00:44.083 --> 00:46.250
structures we've
visited all over the world.

00:46.375 --> 00:50.375
Structures, that according
to ancient astronaut theorists,

00:50.542 --> 00:56.000
provide undeniable evidence
of extraterrestrial contact.

00:57.542 --> 00:59.500

01:12.333 --> 01:15.250
On <i>Ancient Aliens,</i>
we have traveled to some

01:15.375 --> 01:18.333
of the most incredible
structures on the planet.

01:18.500 --> 01:20.833
Structures that
offer compelling evidence

01:20.958 --> 01:24.583
that our ancestors were
visited by extraterrestrials.

01:26.292 --> 01:29.167
And some of the world's
most extraordinary examples

01:29.292 --> 01:33.375
can be found in ancient Egypt,
like the Great Sphinx,

01:33.542 --> 01:37.667
the Pyramids of Giza
and the Luxor Temple.

01:38.583 --> 01:41.583
But Egypt is also home
to a site that a lot of people

01:41.708 --> 01:45.167
don't even know about,
and one I think is amazing.

01:45.333 --> 01:47.500
The Serapeum of Saqqara.

01:47.667 --> 01:49.333
And when I went
to see it in person

01:49.458 --> 01:51.792
with Egyptologist Ramy Romany,

01:51.917 --> 01:55.042
it absolutely blew my mind.

01:55.167 --> 01:57.000
NARRATOR:
Saqqara, Egypt.

01:57.125 --> 01:59.208
1850.

01:59.375 --> 02:01.958
While on
an expedition to recover

02:02.042 --> 02:04.167
ancient manuscripts
for the Louvre Museum

02:04.250 --> 02:08.167
in Paris, French Egyptologist
Auguste Mariette

02:08.292 --> 02:12.333
spots a strange object
sticking out of the sand.

02:12.458 --> 02:15.667
Intrigued, Mariette
has the sand cleared away

02:15.833 --> 02:19.250
and finds large rocks
blocking what looks to be

02:19.375 --> 02:21.667
the entrance
to an underground chamber.

02:22.625 --> 02:26.167
After using explosives to
remove them, he gains entrance

02:26.333 --> 02:28.125
to a tomb complex,

02:28.250 --> 02:31.208
also known as the Serapeum.

02:34.083 --> 02:38.125
In April 2018,
ancient astronaut theorist

02:38.208 --> 02:40.958
Giorgio Tsoukalos
and Egyptologist

02:41.042 --> 02:43.167
and Cairo native Ramy Romany

02:43.292 --> 02:46.167
visited this mysterious site.

02:46.292 --> 02:48.833
-The Serapeum of Saqqara,
Giorgio.
-Yes.

02:48.958 --> 02:50.625
Oh, it's magnificent.

02:50.750 --> 02:54.292
The name
Serapeum comes from Serapis,

02:54.375 --> 02:57.167
-which is Apis bull and Osiris.
-Yes.

02:57.333 --> 02:59.833
-Right.
-Combined together
in one Greek god.

03:00.917 --> 03:03.167
NARRATOR:
Located deep beneath
the desert surface,

03:03.333 --> 03:07.000
lies a 790-foot-long passageway.

03:07.083 --> 03:10.250
There, within a series
of alcoves

03:10.375 --> 03:13.417
neatly carved
out of the limestone rock,

03:13.542 --> 03:16.833
are 24 gigantic
stone sarcophagi.

03:17.792 --> 03:21.208
Each sarcophagus measures
approximately 13 feet long,

03:21.333 --> 03:25.750
seven and a half feet wide
and over ten feet tall.

03:26.750 --> 03:29.083
But just how
the ancient Egyptians

03:29.208 --> 03:31.833
managed to transport
these massive granite boxes

03:31.917 --> 03:33.750
remains unknown,

03:33.875 --> 03:36.292
as does their intended purpose.

03:37.375 --> 03:40.333
ROMANY:
So this is one
of the most mysterious

03:40.458 --> 03:43.167
places in all of Egypt, Giorgio.

03:43.333 --> 03:45.833
Look how far all this goes.

03:47.792 --> 03:52.125
The boxes themselves are,
what, 70 to 75 tons?

03:52.250 --> 03:54.417
-Mm-hmm.
-And then the lids

03:54.542 --> 03:58.125
are estimated
to be 20 to 25 tons.

03:58.208 --> 04:00.667
It's one of the most
mysterious things about

04:00.833 --> 04:03.333
this place is really how

04:03.500 --> 04:06.292
they managed to bring

04:06.417 --> 04:09.542
these heavy structures
all the way down here

04:09.708 --> 04:13.000
when we're breathing
heavily just to get to the end.

04:13.875 --> 04:17.292
Can we actually go
down to some of these?

04:17.375 --> 04:19.083
Of course we can.

04:19.208 --> 04:20.833
Wow.

04:20.917 --> 04:23.167
You know,
I've always read about these.

04:23.250 --> 04:26.000
I've seen pictures,
but it's humungous.

04:26.125 --> 04:28.375
You can walk underneath it.

04:29.667 --> 04:32.500
NARRATOR:
As far as conventional
Egyptologists

04:32.583 --> 04:35.000
and archaeologists
are concerned,

04:35.167 --> 04:37.167
the sarcophagi
were meant to house

04:37.292 --> 04:39.667
the remains
of the sacred Apis bulls.

04:40.833 --> 04:43.542
But as only one of the tombs
was found to contain

04:43.667 --> 04:46.667
animal remains and all
the others were found empty,

04:46.792 --> 04:51.333
the true nature of the Serapeum
is a source of deep contention.

04:52.292 --> 04:56.208
The Apis bull is
a representation for god Osiris

04:56.375 --> 04:58.333
and there's something
very important to mention.

04:58.458 --> 05:02.333
Ancient Egyptians
did not worship animals.

05:02.500 --> 05:05.917
Their concept was the gods
sent the animals to be

05:06.042 --> 05:09.667
their messengers, and we have
to respect them in that way.

05:10.625 --> 05:12.833
ANDREW COLLINS:
It was said that the first ever

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
Apis bull was created

05:16.125 --> 05:17.708
when a ray of light

05:17.875 --> 05:21.125
came down from heaven itself
and struck

05:21.250 --> 05:23.500
this cow

05:23.625 --> 05:26.458
who produced
the first Apis bull.

05:26.542 --> 05:28.875
So there is
some relationship between

05:29.042 --> 05:30.792
the bull itself and the stars.

05:31.625 --> 05:34.583
The sides,
and also here the bottom...

05:34.708 --> 05:38.000
(stammers)
the polishing is perfect.

05:38.125 --> 05:43.167
And we can illustrate this by
just looking at the angle.

05:43.292 --> 05:45.458
I mean,
it's a perfect 90-degree angle.

05:45.542 --> 05:49.333
Check this out.
It is absolute perfection.

05:49.417 --> 05:51.292
It's easy to cut limestone.

05:51.375 --> 05:54.583
But to cut basalt is a...

05:54.708 --> 05:57.208
(chuckles)
That's a different story.

05:57.375 --> 06:00.667
What do these
inscriptions here say?

06:00.750 --> 06:03.125
These inscriptions
were extremely important.

06:03.250 --> 06:07.583
You see the doors, specifically,
the so-called false doors.

06:07.708 --> 06:11.458
They were the doors that allowed
the spirit, the ka and the ba--

06:11.583 --> 06:15.500
the spirit and the soul--
to come out from the mummy.

06:15.583 --> 06:17.917
And then read
the hieroglyphic inscriptions.

06:18.042 --> 06:19.542
They wanted to make sure

06:19.667 --> 06:23.500
that these Apis bulls
come back to life.

06:23.667 --> 06:26.292
Go to eternity,
so they could stay

06:26.375 --> 06:28.500
with Osiris in the sky.

06:28.625 --> 06:30.542
Ancient historians' accounts,

06:30.667 --> 06:33.417
like Herodotus, Strabo,

06:33.542 --> 06:36.167
Eusebius, all of these...

06:36.292 --> 06:38.833
old, old chroniclers
speak of a...

06:38.917 --> 06:43.458
a former glory age of Egypt
known as the Golden Age.

06:43.542 --> 06:48.667
Which some have suggested
dates back as far as 10,500 BC.

06:48.792 --> 06:53.250
So is it possible
that what we have right here

06:53.375 --> 06:56.625
may be a remnant of that time?

06:56.750 --> 06:59.667
When it comes to dating,
I don't have a response.

06:59.750 --> 07:02.458
I can't tell you for a fact

07:02.583 --> 07:04.667
that this was made
3,000 years ago.

07:04.792 --> 07:07.708
Till today there's a debate
on when were these made.

07:07.833 --> 07:11.625
NARRATOR:
Egypt's Golden Age
was a time when humans

07:11.750 --> 07:14.875
are said to have shared
the Earth with the gods.

07:15.042 --> 07:18.667
Gods that, according
to the ancient astronaut theory,

07:18.750 --> 07:22.833
were not mythological figures,
but extraterrestrial visitors.

07:25.125 --> 07:28.500
And there are those who believe
that the figure of the Apis bull

07:28.625 --> 07:31.292
can be found carved
into one of the sarcophagi

07:31.375 --> 07:35.500
not because these giant stone
coffins held mummified bulls,

07:35.625 --> 07:38.333
but because
the Apis bull represented

07:38.458 --> 07:41.125
a connection to the stars.

07:42.792 --> 07:45.000
COLLINS:
It is a fact that
when most of these

07:45.125 --> 07:48.875
gigantic sarcophagi were opened,
nothing was inside them.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.333
But in my opinion...

07:51.458 --> 07:53.208
I think that
this acted as some kind

07:53.333 --> 07:55.458
of otherworldly environment

07:55.542 --> 07:58.750
for communication
with the cosmos itself.

07:58.875 --> 08:02.708
And that
the bulls simply represented

08:02.875 --> 08:07.750
the points of contact with
the cosmic beings themselves.

08:09.917 --> 08:13.250
It doesn't make sense that these
were built for mummified bulls.

08:13.375 --> 08:14.667
First of all...

08:14.792 --> 08:16.708
they're too big for the bulls.

08:16.833 --> 08:19.833
They're beyond human scale.

08:19.958 --> 08:22.083
In order for a human
to get into them,

08:22.208 --> 08:25.917
you would first have
to remove the 15- to 20-ton lid

08:26.042 --> 08:29.833
that was
placed on top of these boxes.

08:29.917 --> 08:33.042
And then climb up
a ladder to get into them.

08:33.167 --> 08:35.875
Is it possible that
what we're looking at here is

08:36.000 --> 08:39.417
an extraterrestrial
technology that was used

08:39.542 --> 08:42.333
thousands of years ago
in ancient Egypt?

08:43.208 --> 08:45.708
What could possibly be
the purpose of these boxes?

08:45.875 --> 08:48.250
What function did they serve?

08:48.375 --> 08:50.542
It's an incredible question.

08:51.958 --> 08:53.875
NARRATOR:
Is it possible that the massive

08:54.000 --> 08:56.583
sarcophagi contained
within the Serapeum of Saqqara

08:56.708 --> 09:00.667
were constructed more
than 10,000 years ago

09:00.833 --> 09:03.292
during a period
when extraterrestrials

09:03.417 --> 09:05.833
inhabited the Earth?

09:05.958 --> 09:08.333
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

09:08.458 --> 09:12.708
and suggest an even more direct
ET connection can be found

09:12.875 --> 09:16.208
by exploring the prehistoric
megaliths of Japan.

09:22.958 --> 09:25.250
Some of the most incredible
structures to have traveled

09:25.375 --> 09:27.833
that have me convinced
that we've been visited

09:28.000 --> 09:29.167
by extraterrestrials are
the ones that look

09:29.333 --> 09:30.667
just like flying craft.

09:30.833 --> 09:32.875
And when I went to Japan,

09:33.000 --> 09:35.500
I had the honor to see
two ancient stone carvings

09:35.667 --> 09:38.875
that are believed
to represent flying ships

09:39.000 --> 09:41.583
witnessed by the people
who lived there

09:41.708 --> 09:43.667
thousands of years ago.

09:45.083 --> 09:49.125
NARRATOR:
Honshu, Japan. April 2017.

09:50.042 --> 09:52.708
Near the modern-day city
of Osaka,

09:52.833 --> 09:55.333
Giorgio Tsoukalos meets
with fellow ancient astronaut

09:55.500 --> 09:59.750
theorist Takeharu Mikami,
to investigate one of the oldest

09:59.875 --> 10:03.125
and holiest sites
in the country.

10:04.375 --> 10:08.333
The Ishi-no-Hoden megalith
is a giant stone monument

10:08.458 --> 10:11.500
carved out of the bedrock on
the mountainside and is believed

10:11.583 --> 10:16.625
by some researchers to date back
an astonishing 16,000 years.

10:19.667 --> 10:21.750
(speaking Japanese)

10:22.667 --> 10:24.458
TSOUKALOS:
Wow.

10:24.583 --> 10:26.750
It's gigantic.

10:27.750 --> 10:29.458
This is... I had no idea.

10:29.542 --> 10:32.125
I mean, it is massive.

10:32.250 --> 10:35.000
(speaking Japanese)

10:35.083 --> 10:38.208
TSUKAMOTO:
The rock itself is said
to weigh about 500 tons.

10:38.375 --> 10:41.750
-500 tons? Wow.
-Yes.

10:42.875 --> 10:44.917
Okay. That's amazing.

10:45.042 --> 10:47.417
I-I want to...
I need to walk around.

10:49.708 --> 10:51.625
Very weird.

10:55.708 --> 10:59.167
I mean, I had no idea
how massive this is.

11:00.625 --> 11:02.750
(Mikami speaking Japanese)

11:03.708 --> 11:06.333
So you want to just
look down below here.

11:08.125 --> 11:09.958
It looks like
it's floating over the water.

11:10.083 --> 11:11.833
TSOUKALOS:
It really does.

11:11.917 --> 11:14.292
(Mikami speaking Japanese)

11:14.375 --> 11:17.083
TSUKAMOTO:
The name for this rock is...
(speaks Japanese)

11:17.208 --> 11:19.583
or "the floating rock
from the heavens."

11:19.708 --> 11:23.583
(speaking Japanese)

11:23.708 --> 11:27.792
TSUKAMOTO:
So this monolith is said to
be related to one of the first

11:27.917 --> 11:30.333
gods that descended
from the heavens to Japan,

11:30.458 --> 11:34.625
and he is said to have
traveled over the country

11:34.750 --> 11:37.333
on a sky ship
made out of a giant rock,

11:37.500 --> 11:40.458
which was called
"Ama no Iwafune,"

11:40.583 --> 11:43.500
which is
"the heavenly rock ship."

11:43.625 --> 11:45.167
So what you're telling me
is that there is

11:45.292 --> 11:48.625
an ancient Japanese legend
that speaks of a deity

11:48.708 --> 11:50.875
flying around in the sky

11:51.000 --> 11:55.125
with a gigantic
vehicle made of stone?

11:56.042 --> 11:58.833
-Absolutely.
-(Tsoukalos laughs)

11:58.917 --> 12:02.167
So do you think that is
the reason why it was called

12:02.292 --> 12:04.042
a vehicle made of stone,

12:04.208 --> 12:06.958
because it was
so powerful and strong

12:07.042 --> 12:09.833
and virtually indestructible

12:09.958 --> 12:13.500
that the story became,
it's a vehicle made of stone?

12:13.625 --> 12:16.125
(speaking Japanese)

12:16.208 --> 12:19.167
You're absolutely right,
because the gods were

12:19.250 --> 12:23.042
flying over
the land on a giant ship.

12:23.167 --> 12:25.250
It wasn't a plane
because it didn't have wings.

12:25.375 --> 12:28.583
It looked like a ship made
out of very hard material

12:28.708 --> 12:31.583
that was like a very hard stone.

12:31.708 --> 12:33.708
And they would descend
from the heavens

12:33.833 --> 12:35.833
and down onto the land,

12:35.958 --> 12:37.750
and thus, they would travel
around the country.

12:37.875 --> 12:40.125
TSOUKALOS:
It's absolutely impressive.

12:41.125 --> 12:45.000
To me, the Ishi-no-Hoden
megalith was an attempt

12:45.167 --> 12:49.542
by our ancestors to document
an extraterrestrial visitation.

12:49.708 --> 12:52.708
And they chose
this incredibly hard stone

12:52.875 --> 12:56.208
as a way to represent
the color and indestructible

12:56.375 --> 12:59.708
nature of the craft
they saw in the sky.

12:59.833 --> 13:02.667
As if this wasn't
proof enough of alien contact,

13:02.750 --> 13:05.750
during my trip to Japan,
I investigated

13:05.875 --> 13:10.167
another ancient site
with an almost identical legend.

13:16.833 --> 13:19.000
Does that say rock ship?

13:19.083 --> 13:21.000
-Masuda rock ship...
-Oh, all right.

13:22.042 --> 13:24.750
NARRATOR:
Giorgio Tsoukalos
and ancient astronaut

13:24.875 --> 13:27.250
theorist Takeharu Mikami

13:27.375 --> 13:30.792
set out
to examine Masuda-no-Iwafune,

13:30.917 --> 13:33.708
an 800-ton rock structure

13:33.833 --> 13:37.042
that was carved from a single
piece of granite and resembles

13:37.167 --> 13:39.833
no other architecture in Japan.

13:39.958 --> 13:43.375
Check out this-this square
grid on the sides.

13:43.500 --> 13:46.792
I mean, this is something
that I've seen before in India,

13:46.875 --> 13:49.667
in Mahabalipuram,
where they have the same

13:49.792 --> 13:51.875
mythologies of celestial beings.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.125
And they had
something very similar

13:55.208 --> 13:57.375
on the side of some
of their rocks, as well.

13:57.500 --> 13:58.625
MIKAMI:
Mm-hmm.

13:58.708 --> 14:00.625
I can't wait to see the top.

14:00.750 --> 14:03.250
Amazing.

14:07.917 --> 14:10.125
-Oh, man.
-Whoa!

14:13.417 --> 14:15.917
Wow. That is...

14:16.042 --> 14:19.958
I mean, I've never seen
anything like it.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.833
NARRATOR:
While some researchers believe

14:23.958 --> 14:26.667
the Masuda-no-Iwafune
megalith is a tomb,

14:26.750 --> 14:29.667
others claim it is
meant to depict

14:29.750 --> 14:31.875
the "sky boats"
that are described

14:32.000 --> 14:34.125
in ancient Japanese stories.

14:34.250 --> 14:37.375
TSOUKALOS:
So the idea is
that this was the entrance

14:37.500 --> 14:40.167
to a Buddhist temple-- what
do they mean by that, inside?

14:40.292 --> 14:41.875
-I mean, where?
-TSUKAMOTO: It would actually

14:42.042 --> 14:43.833
predate Buddhism in Japan.

14:43.917 --> 14:45.333
So it wouldn't
have anything to do

14:45.458 --> 14:47.500
-with Buddhist temples.
-Right, so...

14:47.583 --> 14:49.333
what is the actual translation

14:49.458 --> 14:51.000
of Masuda-no-Iwafune?

14:51.083 --> 14:53.833
(speaking Japanese)

14:53.958 --> 14:56.250
Masuda is the name
of the region,

14:56.375 --> 14:59.833
and Iwafune literally means
"stone ship" or "rock ship."

14:59.958 --> 15:01.167
Okay.

15:01.292 --> 15:03.417
(Mikami speaking Japanese)

15:05.500 --> 15:08.333
TSUKAMOTO:
Yes, it's...
naturally the Iwafune

15:08.417 --> 15:10.000
or "the rock ship"

15:10.167 --> 15:12.667
would have come down
from the heavens as a vehicle

15:12.750 --> 15:15.083
for the gods
to descend upon Earth.

15:15.208 --> 15:17.750
TSOUKALOS:
So I guess with the combination

15:17.875 --> 15:20.375
of the mythologies
of celestial beings,

15:20.542 --> 15:23.000
this could be
some type of representation

15:23.125 --> 15:26.000
of one of those flying vehicles

15:26.125 --> 15:29.167
that our ancestors
perhaps witnessed.

15:29.292 --> 15:32.875
NARRATOR:
Could the massive stone
monuments both in Asuka Park

15:33.042 --> 15:36.417
and in Honshu have been
inspired by encounters

15:36.542 --> 15:40.792
with extraterrestrial craft
descending from the sky?

15:41.750 --> 15:44.542
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes, and they believe

15:44.708 --> 15:47.500
that further proof
of otherworldly contact

15:47.625 --> 15:52.083
in the distant past can be
found halfway around the world,

15:52.208 --> 15:55.083
at a mysterious
megalithic site high

15:55.208 --> 15:57.958
in the Andes Mountains.

16:02.833 --> 16:05.375
Many of the incredible
structuress

16:05.500 --> 16:06.625
found around the world
were built with stone blocks

16:06.750 --> 16:08.792
so massive it seems impossible

16:08.875 --> 16:10.833
that they could have been moved

16:10.958 --> 16:12.417
without advanced technology.

16:12.542 --> 16:15.833
But for me, the site
of Puma Punku in Bolivia

16:15.958 --> 16:18.125
is the most astounding of all,

16:18.208 --> 16:20.667
because not only are the stones

16:20.792 --> 16:24.333
megalithic, they're carved
with a precision that we would

16:24.458 --> 16:28.667
have a hard time replicating
even with modern tools.

16:33.083 --> 16:36.417
Here, 45 miles west of La Paz,

16:36.542 --> 16:39.583
isolated high
in the Andes Mountains...

16:39.708 --> 16:43.750
lie the mysterious
ancient ruins of Puma Punku.

16:44.958 --> 16:47.667
Spread across
a desert plateau at an altitude

16:47.792 --> 16:49.958
of over 12,000 feet,

16:50.083 --> 16:52.875
the megalithic stones
found here are

16:53.042 --> 16:56.000
among the largest on the planet,

16:56.083 --> 16:58.875
some measuring
up to 26 feet long

16:59.000 --> 17:01.542
and weighing more than 100 tons.

17:02.500 --> 17:06.167
DAVID CHILDRESS:
What you have here are
massive blocks

17:06.292 --> 17:09.833
scattered
like some kid's toy blocks

17:10.000 --> 17:12.333
around the site.

17:12.500 --> 17:15.042
It's like
some giant cataclysm

17:15.208 --> 17:18.667
just wiped out this entire area.

17:20.375 --> 17:22.583
Archaeologists are baffled

17:22.708 --> 17:25.833
by what Puma Punku was,

17:25.917 --> 17:29.167
how it looked
and what the purpose

17:29.250 --> 17:32.958
of this enormous
structure would have been.

17:33.083 --> 17:36.042
One of the amazing
things here at Puma Punku

17:36.208 --> 17:39.500
is the precision of the blocks.

17:39.583 --> 17:42.750
You can see with this
block that it's really been cut

17:42.875 --> 17:47.042
at very accurate right angles.

17:48.167 --> 17:52.292
Not only do these
blocks have precision corners,

17:52.375 --> 17:55.375
but they also have these...

17:55.500 --> 17:58.208
difficult
drill holes that are going

17:58.333 --> 18:00.208
right through the rock.

18:03.083 --> 18:07.250
NARRATOR:
In January 2011,
ancient astronaut theorist

18:07.375 --> 18:09.042
David Childress and author

18:09.208 --> 18:12.167
Brien Foerster
gained unprecedented access

18:12.250 --> 18:15.042
to investigate
this incredible site.

18:15.208 --> 18:18.000
You know, Brien,
this is one of the most

18:18.083 --> 18:20.708
interesting and unusual stones

18:20.875 --> 18:22.750
here at Puma Punku.

18:22.875 --> 18:25.125
It's got these
perfect right angles and...

18:26.583 --> 18:29.000
...and then each of these
small drill holes

18:29.125 --> 18:32.083
are basically evenly spaced

18:32.208 --> 18:35.125
along this routed groove.

18:36.625 --> 18:39.542
To me it's clear that
power tools have been used

18:39.667 --> 18:42.792
on this unusual block
of stone here.

18:42.875 --> 18:44.917
Well, exactly.
And this surface is as smooth

18:45.042 --> 18:47.333
as a tabletop,
like in your kitchen.

18:47.458 --> 18:49.458
There's no
wave to it or anything.

18:49.542 --> 18:52.333
This was machined,
but who machined it?

18:52.458 --> 18:55.458
It's an astonishing
piece of work.

18:55.542 --> 18:58.833
And how anyone could think
that primitive human beings

18:58.958 --> 19:01.667
could have done this,
you know, it's just crazy.

19:01.833 --> 19:05.167
If anything looks like
ancient aliens, it's this stone.

19:06.750 --> 19:10.458
NARRATOR:
What did the ancients use to
cut these stones so precisely?

19:11.500 --> 19:14.375
Might evidence of advanced
technology be found

19:14.500 --> 19:16.167
by further study
of the construction

19:16.250 --> 19:19.083
of the Puma Punku stones?

19:19.208 --> 19:21.833
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

19:21.958 --> 19:23.792
and point to what they call

19:23.875 --> 19:26.208
H-blocks.

19:27.542 --> 19:31.917
It seems like every one of these
H-blocks is exactly the same.

19:32.042 --> 19:34.667
So it's like
a prefabrication process

19:34.792 --> 19:38.000
where they needed
X-hundred of these

19:38.125 --> 19:42.417
and whatever machinery it
is that they had was able with

19:42.542 --> 19:46.000
amazing accuracy to replicate
one after another after another.

19:46.083 --> 19:47.750
It seems as though

19:47.875 --> 19:51.042
some kind of factory
was set up there

19:51.167 --> 19:53.500
to make these
almost exactly the same.

19:53.625 --> 19:56.625
It's almost like a Lego
system of interconnecting blocks

19:56.708 --> 19:58.792
and that
is unique on this Earth.

19:59.750 --> 20:04.500
CHILDRESS:
It's an ingenious way
of building a huge wall.

20:04.583 --> 20:09.417
And again, the whole thing
is just so incredibly precise.

20:09.542 --> 20:13.583
Doing these kind of
inside corners like this.

20:13.708 --> 20:16.792
This-this just
can't be done really with,

20:16.875 --> 20:20.708
with copper chisels and...
and stone hammers.

20:20.833 --> 20:26.833
The whole thing is... is just
so incredibly high-tech.

20:26.917 --> 20:28.958
Even beyond
what we would do today.

20:30.042 --> 20:33.500
We don't really know
the age of Puma Punku.

20:33.583 --> 20:38.833
Archeologists have come up
with wildly different ages.

20:39.708 --> 20:42.917
Starting with
early excavations here,

20:43.042 --> 20:47.917
thinking that Puma Punku
was up to 20,000 years old.

20:48.042 --> 20:51.208
But the kind of machinery
that would need to be used

20:51.333 --> 20:54.042
to articulate
and cut these blocks

20:54.167 --> 20:56.667
would be giant diamond saws

20:56.750 --> 21:00.458
with huge blades,
powerful routers.

21:00.542 --> 21:03.792
Even possibly
we're talking about

21:03.917 --> 21:07.333
plasma cutters
and melting of stone.

21:08.292 --> 21:11.000
Something that
is only being worked on

21:11.125 --> 21:13.083
today by modern scientists.

21:14.417 --> 21:16.542
NARRATOR:
According
to the local Aymara people

21:16.667 --> 21:19.500
who have inhabited
this region for centuries,

21:19.667 --> 21:22.542
Puma Punku
was built in a single day.

21:22.667 --> 21:26.042
And not by humans,
but by the sky gods.

21:26.917 --> 21:30.917
They say, "The gods
constructed the place

21:31.042 --> 21:32.500
in one night."

21:32.583 --> 21:34.750
This makes sense.

21:34.875 --> 21:37.000
You have
an extraterrestrial crew.

21:37.125 --> 21:38.833
They come down to Earth.

21:38.917 --> 21:42.583
So they construct with
their tools

21:42.708 --> 21:45.750
just something, which we would
call today, a basic camp.

21:47.708 --> 21:50.333
CHILDRESS:
When you look at
the complexity of Puma Punku,

21:50.417 --> 21:53.000
the huge platforms,
the interlocking blocks

21:53.125 --> 21:57.625
made into what they thought
were indestructible walls.

21:59.417 --> 22:02.500
What you could have,
is the kind of

22:02.625 --> 22:06.458
perfectly made space port,

22:06.542 --> 22:08.792
that extraterrestrials
would want.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.292
NARRATOR:
Might the ancient city
of Puma Punku

22:14.375 --> 22:17.333
really have
been built by alien beings,

22:17.458 --> 22:20.042
as ancient astronaut theorists
contend?

22:21.542 --> 22:24.417
If so, what
happened to these massive,

22:24.542 --> 22:27.250
seemingly
indestructible structures?

22:27.375 --> 22:30.542
CHILDRESS:
One possibility is that
Puma Punku was destroyed

22:30.667 --> 22:35.542
in some
artificial blast that literally

22:35.667 --> 22:37.708
blew these buildings apart.

22:37.875 --> 22:40.500
So much of it
is not simply broken.

22:40.583 --> 22:43.833
It's shattered to
the point where you can find

22:43.958 --> 22:47.000
little tiny pieces
of diorite anywhere you look.

22:47.125 --> 22:50.625
And that looks to me
like an explosion happened.

22:50.750 --> 22:53.667
At the end of its use,
they may have simply

22:53.750 --> 22:56.667
blown it up because
they didn't want anyone

22:56.792 --> 22:59.583
to use the technology
that they had left behind.

23:00.708 --> 23:02.292
NARRATOR:
Precision stonework.

23:02.375 --> 23:05.417
Unparalleled engineering.

23:05.542 --> 23:09.000
And incomprehensible
destruction.

23:10.250 --> 23:12.167
Is it possible that Puma Punku

23:12.292 --> 23:16.708
was a point of extraterrestrial
contact in the distant past?

23:17.708 --> 23:20.417
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes

23:20.542 --> 23:24.125
and suggest further
evidence of alien engineering

23:24.208 --> 23:27.667
can be found on a small island
in the Mediterranean...

23:27.833 --> 23:32.750
that is home to extraordinary
stone structures.

23:37.708 --> 23:40.292
One of the most
incredible structures

23:40.375 --> 23:42.500
that I've ever seen is on
the Italian island of Sardinia.

23:42.583 --> 23:45.250
This Mediterranean island has

23:45.375 --> 23:48.292
thousands
of mysterious stone towers,

23:48.375 --> 23:51.292
bizarre statues...

23:51.375 --> 23:54.167
and even an ancient pyramid.

23:54.292 --> 23:58.708
But what was most amazing to me
was the Well of Santa Cristina.

23:58.875 --> 24:02.917
It features stonework so
precise that there is no way

24:03.042 --> 24:06.917
it could have been built without
advanced engineering knowledge.

24:12.333 --> 24:15.750
NARRATOR: Oak Island
treasure hunter Marty Lagina

24:15.875 --> 24:19.625
has invited Giorgio Tsoukalos
to help him explore Sardinia's

24:19.750 --> 24:23.375
mysterious structures and offer
his unique perspective.

24:23.500 --> 24:26.000
Local guide Ivana Malu

24:26.125 --> 24:28.667
has taken them
to the Well of Santa Cristina,

24:28.750 --> 24:30.833
an ancient structure believed

24:30.958 --> 24:34.792
to have been built
sometime around 1800 BC.

24:35.833 --> 24:38.667
(both speaking Italian)

24:38.750 --> 24:41.167
NARRATOR: They are met
by archaeo-astronomer

24:41.292 --> 24:43.208
Mauro Peppino Zedda.

24:44.250 --> 24:46.667
-Now, wait a minute,
wait a minute, <i>a speta.</i>
-Yeah, <i>prego.</i>

24:46.750 --> 24:48.167
These are modern, right?
This is reproduction.

24:48.292 --> 24:50.375
-No, no, I mean it.
-No, I know! I know. I know.

24:50.500 --> 24:52.333
-This is reproduction.
-It's what people say
when they are here.

24:52.458 --> 24:55.667
They say, "Oh, Ivana,
that's a fake, what is that?"

24:55.750 --> 24:57.875
Can you imagine
the well is 3,000 years old?

24:58.000 --> 24:59.917
No, honestly,
these are the original stones?

25:00.042 --> 25:02.708
-Really, believe me, 100%.
-Wow.

25:02.833 --> 25:05.708
That is built
to last for the eternity.

25:05.875 --> 25:07.250
Well, this is spectacular.

25:08.708 --> 25:12.500
NARRATOR:
The Well of Santa Cristina
demonstrates such incredible

25:12.625 --> 25:14.958
masonry skill that
archaeologists struggle

25:15.042 --> 25:18.958
to explain how it was built
by so-called primitive people.

25:20.667 --> 25:22.833
Based on his years of research,

25:22.917 --> 25:25.667
Giorgio believes that
the stonework may provide

25:25.792 --> 25:28.208
important clues
for the theory that a race

25:28.375 --> 25:32.125
of extraterrestrial giants
once inhabited the island.

25:33.875 --> 25:36.333
Do you want
to touch with your hand

25:36.417 --> 25:38.292
-the sophistication of the wall?
-Yes.

25:38.375 --> 25:39.875
Here we go.

25:42.375 --> 25:44.000
Wow.

25:44.083 --> 25:46.000
-Unbelievable.
-This is crazy.

25:46.125 --> 25:48.333
TSOUKALOS:
Look at this, it is round.

25:48.458 --> 25:50.083
It's a perfect circle.

25:50.208 --> 25:53.833
You can't put a piece of paper,
there's no mortar used

25:53.958 --> 25:56.083
to put this stuff together.

25:56.208 --> 25:58.958
-I mean, <i>incredible questo.</i>
-It's amazing.

25:59.083 --> 26:02.667
MARTY: Not only is it
constructed beautifully,

26:02.833 --> 26:06.042
the foundation is
below the water table.

26:06.167 --> 26:10.125
Okay, that's very hard to do. I
could tell you from Oak Island,

26:10.208 --> 26:12.333
working in the water
is difficult.

26:12.417 --> 26:14.917
This is spectacular.

26:16.625 --> 26:18.958
Santa Cristina Holy Well
is one of the most

26:19.042 --> 26:20.750
important sites in Sardinia.

26:22.958 --> 26:24.792
It's part
of a Nuragic settlement

26:24.917 --> 26:27.208
that dates back to 1500 BC

26:27.333 --> 26:30.000
with nuraghe towers, menhirs,
standing stones,

26:30.125 --> 26:33.667
and everything else there,
but the most interesting part

26:33.792 --> 26:36.250
of that is this
very sophisticated well.

26:36.375 --> 26:38.250
It's the most precision-carved

26:38.375 --> 26:41.708
stonework I've seen in all
of the Mediterranean, really.

26:41.833 --> 26:44.167
It's almost like it was built
by the Egyptians

26:44.292 --> 26:47.208
or the Peruvian stone masons.
It's so advanced.

26:49.667 --> 26:51.333
It's very fascinating.

26:51.417 --> 26:54.750
The walls around here,
any child can do this.

26:54.875 --> 26:58.000
You don't need any sophisticated
technology to do this.

26:58.125 --> 27:01.500
But that in there,
especially if you think

27:01.583 --> 27:04.542
that there
was no written record,

27:04.708 --> 27:07.292
how was this preconceived?

27:07.375 --> 27:09.458
Somebody had to think about it.

27:10.458 --> 27:14.417
Clearly there's two type
of builders

27:14.542 --> 27:17.750
that were present there,
because you have the well,

27:17.875 --> 27:20.750
which is absolute
perfect stone masonry.

27:20.875 --> 27:23.792
And then you have
the walls around it

27:23.875 --> 27:27.500
that clearly were created
by a later culture,

27:27.583 --> 27:30.042
because it's
not sophisticated at all.

27:30.167 --> 27:33.333
It's just a bunch of
stones thrown together.

27:33.458 --> 27:36.667
Yet, the well that
goes deep into the ground,

27:36.792 --> 27:40.125
it is unlike
anything that I've ever seen.

27:41.208 --> 27:44.417
The question is,
there was no written language.

27:44.542 --> 27:46.208
How was this planned?

27:46.333 --> 27:50.875
Because if you
look at this from above,

27:51.000 --> 27:55.417
it's this keyhole shape,
and that to me is fascinating.

27:56.375 --> 27:59.000
I have not seen
anything quite like this, okay?

27:59.125 --> 28:01.708
I'm-I'm literally wowed by this.

28:01.875 --> 28:04.458
TSOUKALOS:
Clearly someone told the local

28:04.542 --> 28:09.333
people how to place these
stones into different areas

28:09.417 --> 28:12.792
because it was a connection
to the celestial realm.

28:12.917 --> 28:15.333
So you're
surmising the technology

28:15.417 --> 28:17.125
was given to these people?

28:17.250 --> 28:19.333
-The engineering knowledge.
-Yeah, okay.

28:19.458 --> 28:21.667
Because this screams

28:21.792 --> 28:24.167
-mathematics.
-Yes, it does.

28:24.292 --> 28:26.500
(stammers) I will certainly
concur to so-- to this extent,

28:26.625 --> 28:29.708
someone or some ones

28:29.875 --> 28:31.625
had extraordinary
knowledge here.

28:31.708 --> 28:33.708
-This is not easy to build.
-No.

28:33.833 --> 28:36.583
NARRATOR:
Is it possible that someone gave

28:36.708 --> 28:40.167
the ancient Sardinians highly
advanced engineering knowledge?

28:41.042 --> 28:44.000
And that that knowledge
was passed down

28:44.083 --> 28:47.708
generation by generation
for thousands of years?

28:47.833 --> 28:50.542
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

28:50.708 --> 28:52.792
and point to another structure

28:52.875 --> 28:54.500
in mainland Italy,

28:54.583 --> 28:58.333
said to have been built
under the direction of a god.

29:03.458 --> 29:06.875
Any discussion about
incredible structures

29:07.000 --> 29:09.958
has to include
cyclopean architecture.

29:10.083 --> 29:12.125
This construction style
where massive stone blocks,

29:12.250 --> 29:15.292
known as megaliths, are fit
together like puzzle pieces,

29:15.417 --> 29:18.375
can be found
all over the ancient world.

29:18.500 --> 29:22.167
And when I visited Italy,
I saw one of the most incredible

29:22.292 --> 29:25.750
examples of this
extraordinary architecture

29:25.875 --> 29:29.208
at the megalithic walls
of Ferentino.

29:35.208 --> 29:38.042
Ancient astronaut
theorist Giorgio Tsoukalos

29:38.167 --> 29:40.750
is in the heart
of the Italian peninsula,

29:40.875 --> 29:44.292
about 50 miles
southeast of Rome.

29:45.125 --> 29:48.167
This area of Italy,
known as Latium,

29:48.292 --> 29:51.250
was considered the epicenter
of the Roman civilization.

29:51.375 --> 29:53.542
Giorgio is eager to investigate

29:53.667 --> 29:57.333
the ancient city's massive
megalithic walls, considered

29:57.458 --> 30:00.333
to be some of the finest
constructions in Italy.

30:00.458 --> 30:03.083
<i>-Piacere.</i> Thank you.
-Welcome to Italy
and to Churcheria.

30:03.208 --> 30:05.833
NARRATOR:
For expert insight,
he has called

30:05.958 --> 30:09.167
upon local historian
Danila Bracaglia.

30:09.292 --> 30:13.083
This is, uh, beautiful-- what
can you tell me about this area?

30:13.208 --> 30:16.458
Ferentino, where we are today,
is actually known

30:16.542 --> 30:19.833
for these constructions of,
uh, the megalithic walls,

30:20.000 --> 30:23.417
founded according
to the tradition by god Saturn.

30:23.542 --> 30:26.667
TSOUKALOS:
Okay. This is fascinating
to me because this

30:26.792 --> 30:28.167
is one of the reasons
why I'm here.

30:28.292 --> 30:31.042
What can you tell me
about the mythologies

30:31.167 --> 30:33.083
of Saturn in this area here?

30:33.208 --> 30:34.833
So the five cities of Saturn

30:34.958 --> 30:37.375
are all a few kilometers
one from another.

30:37.500 --> 30:39.458
And the tradition says,
you know,

30:39.542 --> 30:42.583
the towns were founded
by Saturn and the Titans.

30:44.208 --> 30:47.875
NARRATOR: In Greek mythology,
the Titans were humanlike gods

30:48.042 --> 30:51.167
of enormous stature,
who were eventually overthrown

30:51.250 --> 30:53.458
by their children,
the Olympians.

30:54.583 --> 30:58.417
Saturn is the Roman name
for the Titan Cronus,

30:58.542 --> 31:02.167
who was said to have reigned as
an earthly king alongside Janus,

31:02.292 --> 31:06.500
during a "Golden Age" when
the gods walked among humans.

31:06.625 --> 31:09.958
Could it be
that Saturn and the Titans

31:10.042 --> 31:12.125
actually existed on Earth...

31:12.250 --> 31:14.000
and were responsible

31:14.083 --> 31:15.542
for helping
to construct the megalithic

31:15.667 --> 31:19.000
structures found
throughout the Mediterranean?

31:19.125 --> 31:21.875
So, Danila,
where are we right now?

31:22.000 --> 31:23.750
So, this is one of
the entrance gates to the town.

31:23.875 --> 31:26.625
And here, it's actually
a perfect point

31:26.750 --> 31:29.625
where you can understand
the stratification of the time.

31:31.083 --> 31:33.792
You see the huge blocks

31:33.875 --> 31:35.833
from the pre-Roman time,

31:35.917 --> 31:38.625
then smaller blocks built

31:38.750 --> 31:42.083
in the Roman time, and finally
the Middle Age on top.

31:43.042 --> 31:45.500
So basically,
you can see the-the megalithic

31:45.583 --> 31:48.417
structure, then the Roman
and then Medieval Age.

31:48.542 --> 31:51.000
Exactly. And it's
like reading a history book.

31:51.083 --> 31:53.667
So it's, uh,
because here it's evident

31:53.750 --> 31:56.125
that people lived here
for thousands of years

31:56.208 --> 31:58.833
and-and then they
had different technique

31:58.958 --> 32:01.042
of construction, some of them,

32:01.167 --> 32:04.125
like the megalithic, uh,
constructions are lost,

32:04.208 --> 32:07.125
so we don't know exactly,
uh, when they were built.

32:07.208 --> 32:10.917
TSOUKALOS:
Which is, in a strange way,
a contradiction

32:11.042 --> 32:15.167
because in ancient times
what we're told is that

32:15.250 --> 32:19.042
not much technology existed,
so in order to move blocks

32:19.208 --> 32:21.167
like this and put them together,

32:21.250 --> 32:22.833
was an incredible
accomplishment,

32:22.958 --> 32:24.875
because it's kind
of understandable

32:25.000 --> 32:29.250
how those blocks were moved,
and of course the smaller blocks

32:29.375 --> 32:32.000
at the very top,
it's not even a question.

32:32.083 --> 32:36.167
So logic would dictate
that at first they begin

32:36.292 --> 32:39.417
with the smaller
blocks and then, over time,

32:39.542 --> 32:42.333
maybe used bigger blocks,
but it's the opposite way.

32:42.458 --> 32:45.375
So it's to me
somewhat of a mystery.

32:45.500 --> 32:48.167
At a certain point
the technology was lost.

32:48.292 --> 32:51.000
We don't know
how they were made for sure.

32:51.167 --> 32:53.417
There is no reference,
there's no reference in our

32:53.542 --> 32:58.208
books or, uh, sources
about how they were built.

32:58.375 --> 33:01.917
TSOUKALOS:
Do you know if all
these five cities of Saturn

33:02.042 --> 33:04.250
have the cyclopean walls?

33:04.375 --> 33:06.667
BRACAGLIA: Yes, they have,
uh, these walls, megalithics,

33:06.792 --> 33:08.708
or huge stones,

33:08.875 --> 33:12.167
and some of them are
better preserved than others.

33:12.333 --> 33:15.833
NARRATOR:
Cyclopean walls
consist of enormous stone

33:15.917 --> 33:18.875
blocks stacked together
without the use of mortar.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.833
TSOUKALOS:
I mean, this is incredible.

33:21.958 --> 33:23.375
And this region is not the only

33:23.500 --> 33:25.167
place that has these walls.

33:25.333 --> 33:27.750
For example,
we have them also in Greece.

33:28.625 --> 33:30.583
What's even more
fascinating is that

33:30.708 --> 33:33.042
we have similar walls
on the other side

33:33.167 --> 33:36.583
of the world
in Sacsayhuamán, Peru.

33:36.708 --> 33:39.500
You see these, uh,
different blocks not only

33:39.625 --> 33:41.708
in Sacsayhuamán,
you see them for example

33:41.833 --> 33:44.292
in Abydos. Abydos is in Egypt,

33:44.375 --> 33:46.583
you see a wall, you could think

33:46.708 --> 33:50.167
we are standing in Peru,
but Abydos is in Egypt.

33:51.333 --> 33:54.125
You see it on Easter Island.

33:54.208 --> 33:56.708
Which means
to me the same teachers.

33:57.917 --> 34:01.208
CHILDRESS:
The idea that this
unusual construction

34:01.333 --> 34:04.708
using giant blocks of stone
that are weighing

34:04.875 --> 34:07.000
up to 200 tons

34:07.125 --> 34:09.375
would be individually developed

34:09.542 --> 34:13.500
in each of these sites
is virtually impossible.

34:13.667 --> 34:18.625
So some architect
and designer and engineer

34:18.750 --> 34:21.375
developed this technique
and now it's

34:21.542 --> 34:25.250
being used
literally all over the world.

34:25.375 --> 34:27.875
Who is that designer?

34:28.000 --> 34:31.500
Who is that engineer
who came up with this worldwide

34:31.625 --> 34:34.750
megalithic
construction technique?

34:35.792 --> 34:37.250
Is it extraterrestrials?

34:37.375 --> 34:40.583
From completely
opposite sides of the planet,

34:40.708 --> 34:45.292
we have similar, if not
identical, construction styles.

34:46.208 --> 34:48.250
According to
the ancient astronaut theory,

34:48.375 --> 34:51.792
Saturn was
one of the founding gods

34:51.917 --> 34:54.292
of civilization on Earth.

34:54.417 --> 34:58.000
So the idea that this
may have had something to do

34:58.125 --> 35:01.708
with an extraterrestrial visit
to me is-is fascinating.

35:08.125 --> 35:11.167
NARRATOR:
Could it be that ancient
people all around the world

35:11.292 --> 35:13.708
were taught how
to build megalithic structures

35:13.833 --> 35:18.333
by extraterrestrials
that came down from the sky?

35:18.458 --> 35:21.417
Perhaps further clues
can be found

35:21.542 --> 35:24.167
by examining
an ancient temple in India

35:24.292 --> 35:26.625
that displays highly
sophisticated

35:26.708 --> 35:28.917
engineering knowledge, credited

35:29.042 --> 35:31.667
to a divine architect.

35:36.625 --> 35:40.417
Any list of incredible
structures would be incomplete

35:40.542 --> 35:42.917
without featuring the amazing
architecture of India.

35:44.375 --> 35:47.625
And of all the astounding places
we've visited on <i>Ancient Aliens,</i>

35:47.750 --> 35:52.042
one of the most baffling
is the Surang Tila temple.

35:52.167 --> 35:56.167
This unbelievable site was
built using ancient construction

35:56.292 --> 35:59.958
techniques that rival
anything you'd see today.

36:06.375 --> 36:09.833
Ancient astronaut theorist
Giorgio Tsoukalos

36:09.958 --> 36:13.042
is meeting up with archaeologist
Dr. Arun Sharma,

36:13.167 --> 36:16.875
to get an up-close look
at the Surang Tila temple.

36:17.875 --> 36:20.208
The temple was buried
beneath a mound of soil

36:20.333 --> 36:23.417
for hundreds of years
until 2006,

36:23.542 --> 36:26.958
when Dr. Sharma headed
an excavation of the site.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.667
This is beautiful.

36:37.875 --> 36:39.583
Mm-hmm.

36:49.250 --> 36:50.417
Really?

36:51.667 --> 36:53.833
NARRATOR:
Incredibly, the earthquake
that hit Sirpur

36:54.000 --> 36:57.333
in the 11th century leveled
every modern building

36:57.417 --> 36:59.667
that was standing at the time.

36:59.792 --> 37:03.333
Only the ancient
Surang Tila temple survived.

37:04.375 --> 37:06.167
Now, is this considered

37:06.250 --> 37:07.875
Ayurvedic architecture
right here?

37:11.167 --> 37:14.292
NARRATOR:
Ayurvedic architecture
is a construction technique

37:14.417 --> 37:16.958
derived from
the ancient science of design

37:17.042 --> 37:21.375
found in Indian texts
dating back thousands of years.

37:33.667 --> 37:36.000
That's amazing. Huh.

37:39.208 --> 37:40.500
Okay.

37:49.583 --> 37:52.042
It seems to be almost
like some type of glue.

38:08.917 --> 38:12.000
NARRATOR:
The glue-like substance
is said to form a bond

38:12.125 --> 38:14.833
that is at least 20 times
stronger than concrete.

38:15.708 --> 38:18.083
But modern builders
have been unwilling

38:18.208 --> 38:21.667
to entertain the notion
that such an ancient concoction

38:21.792 --> 38:25.167
could be superior to
today's building materials.

38:25.333 --> 38:27.667
Wow, look at this. Beautiful.

38:27.833 --> 38:31.542
The detailed instructions
for making this paste can be

38:31.667 --> 38:35.792
found in an ancient Indian
text known as the Mayamatam,

38:35.917 --> 38:39.625
a manuscript dedicated
to construction techniques.

38:40.750 --> 38:43.375
The information
contained within the document

38:43.542 --> 38:45.917
is understood to have
been passed down to humans

38:46.042 --> 38:49.292
from Mayasura, the ancient
king of the demigods

38:49.375 --> 38:53.708
who was said to oversee various
construction projects on Earth.

39:03.875 --> 39:05.708
This right here?

39:05.875 --> 39:07.292
NARRATOR:
Curiously, there is
a more astounding

39:07.375 --> 39:10.000
earthquake-proof feature
at the site

39:10.167 --> 39:13.875
to indicate advanced knowledge
was used in its construction.

39:15.083 --> 39:18.708
Located at key points
within the Surang Tila temple

39:18.833 --> 39:21.875
are several 80-foot-long shafts
designed to form

39:22.042 --> 39:26.000
air pockets that can dissipate
the impact of seismic events.

39:31.208 --> 39:33.333
Yes, please.

39:33.458 --> 39:36.167
All right.

39:36.333 --> 39:38.417
Wow.

39:38.542 --> 39:41.333
Oh, wow. This is big.
It's a huge book.

39:41.417 --> 39:43.917
And-and this text has
been around

39:44.042 --> 39:46.625
for 4,500 years?

39:52.125 --> 39:54.917
In your opinion, where
did this knowledge come from?

40:07.083 --> 40:09.667
And you think
that this knowledge

40:09.792 --> 40:11.917
originated from the stars?

40:16.042 --> 40:17.083
That's amazing.

40:21.542 --> 40:25.667
NARRATOR:
The Sarang Tila temple stands
as an incredible testament

40:25.792 --> 40:29.167
to the advanced architectural
techniques of our ancestors.

40:29.292 --> 40:32.458
Techniques reportedly
passed down to them

40:32.542 --> 40:34.833
from their divine teachers.

40:34.917 --> 40:37.750
And the archaeologist
in charge of the dig

40:37.875 --> 40:40.875
is convinced that
the knowledge came directly

40:41.000 --> 40:43.583
from extraterrestrial visitors.

40:44.542 --> 40:48.667
Every one of the incredible
structures we've traveled to

40:48.750 --> 40:51.542
on <i>Ancient Aliens</i>
provides evidence

40:51.667 --> 40:53.792
that our ancestors had contact

40:53.917 --> 40:56.167
with extraterrestrials
in the distant past.

40:56.292 --> 40:58.750
And when you put it all
together, you have,

40:58.875 --> 41:01.583
in my opinion, undeniable proof

41:01.708 --> 41:03.667
for the ancient
astronaut theory.

41:03.792 --> 41:07.833
How else can you explain
that thousands of years ago,

41:07.958 --> 41:12.125
people in Japan, Egypt, Italy,

41:12.208 --> 41:16.917
Bolivia, and other locations
all around the world were

41:17.042 --> 41:20.833
somehow able to build these
massive megalithic structures?

41:20.917 --> 41:23.375
To me, the answer is clear.

41:23.500 --> 41:25.708
They had help
from alien visitors.
