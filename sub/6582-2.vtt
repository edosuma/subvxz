00:03.738 --> 00:05.270
'Previously on The Royals...'

00:05.272 --> 00:08.207
The King was stabbed twice
with a large knife.

00:08.209 --> 00:10.142
Still wearing black, I see.

00:10.144 --> 00:13.278
Have you considered the fact
I may actually be mourning?

00:13.280 --> 00:15.614
As if. It's been two months.

00:15.616 --> 00:17.750
Took me about two weeks.

00:17.752 --> 00:20.152
She doesn't love you like I do.

00:23.090 --> 00:24.623
Beck, what are you doing here?

00:24.625 --> 00:26.225
I left her.

00:26.227 --> 00:28.093
For good.

00:29.196 --> 00:31.263
From my personal collection.

00:31.606 --> 00:34.507
Perhaps you can wear them to
the opening of Parliament.

00:34.509 --> 00:37.274
You realize that you're stalking me?

00:37.276 --> 00:39.324
What's it gonna take
for you to forgive me?

00:39.326 --> 00:41.031
Nothing.

00:42.776 --> 00:45.848
'She needs to be controlled.
They both do.'

00:45.850 --> 00:47.624
Reinstate their titles.

00:47.626 --> 00:49.690
Make it look like they work for us.

00:49.692 --> 00:51.688
Not against us.

00:51.690 --> 00:54.029
Godspeed, my King.

00:56.439 --> 00:58.418
And know that I'll avenge you.

00:58.540 --> 01:01.748
This was hanging around my neck the
night before the King was killed.

01:01.750 --> 01:03.490
We figure this out,

01:03.492 --> 01:05.539
we figure out who's
been killing my family

01:05.541 --> 01:07.314
and then we make them pay.

01:07.316 --> 01:08.988
You weren't with Cyrus that night.

01:08.990 --> 01:10.251
Course I was.

01:11.602 --> 01:14.349
OK, he wasn't with me.
I wasn't with him.

01:15.444 --> 01:17.969
Apologize. Kiss the ring and it's over.

01:21.659 --> 01:23.160
What was that?

01:23.162 --> 01:24.969
If we want answers, we need access.

01:24.971 --> 01:27.360
You want to know who killed
Robert, who killed Dad?

01:27.362 --> 01:28.487
You know I do.

01:28.489 --> 01:30.741
We need to be in the
palace and now we are.

01:30.743 --> 01:33.849
- They're up to something.
- They don't get rid of us, Liam.

01:33.851 --> 01:36.120
We get rid of them.

01:38.000 --> 01:44.074

01:51.250 --> 01:54.988
Las Vegas. You're from Las Vegas.
That's your story?

01:54.990 --> 01:57.310
That's right.

01:57.312 --> 01:59.222
You have an English accent.

01:59.224 --> 02:01.476
This is my real accent.

02:02.204 --> 02:03.907
That's not even a good accent.

02:03.909 --> 02:06.157
- You can do better?
- Yes, I can.

02:06.159 --> 02:07.930
OK. Here we go.

02:07.932 --> 02:10.860
My name is Frank J Gallagher

02:10.863 --> 02:14.510
and I'm... well, I'm an
American, that's what I am.

02:14.512 --> 02:16.794
- You sound ridiculous.
- You sound ridiculous.

02:16.796 --> 02:18.294
How about them Dodgers?

02:18.296 --> 02:21.328
- Dodgers.
- Dodgerrrrs.

02:21.330 --> 02:24.124
- OK.
- Frank J Gallagher.

02:24.126 --> 02:26.034
Yes, sir, I got me some blue jeans,

02:26.036 --> 02:27.738
and a pick-it-up truck.

02:27.740 --> 02:29.919
Where abouts in America
are you from exactly?

02:29.921 --> 02:31.641
- Chicago.
- No.

02:31.643 --> 02:33.772
- You're not.
- I am. I'm from Chicago.

02:33.774 --> 02:35.886
How about them Dodgerrrrs?

02:35.889 --> 02:38.580
I'm
sorry I brought it up.

02:38.582 --> 02:42.228
You should be.
You... American.

02:45.617 --> 02:47.148
What are we doing here anyway?

02:47.150 --> 02:49.672
Waiting for this.

02:52.537 --> 02:55.126
We're on a stakeout? Sweet.

02:55.128 --> 02:57.411
Just watch the Rolls, Frank.

02:58.436 --> 03:01.025
Frank J.Gallagher.

03:01.811 --> 03:03.513
From Chicago.

03:05.461 --> 03:07.058
What do you see?

03:07.343 --> 03:09.995
Cyrus bringing the taxpayer's money.
So what?

03:09.997 --> 03:11.730
But it's not Cyrus.

03:11.732 --> 03:14.044
It's his double.

03:16.189 --> 03:17.819
Where is he?

03:21.410 --> 03:23.500
I've been tracking him
the last few weeks.

03:23.502 --> 03:25.115
Last door on the right.

03:25.118 --> 03:26.731
He usually stays one, two hours.

03:26.733 --> 03:28.602
- What's in there?
- I don't know.

03:28.604 --> 03:30.184
I'll let you do the honors.

03:30.186 --> 03:31.800
- Oh, hell yeah.
- You want my gun?

03:31.802 --> 03:33.518
I don't know. Do I need your gun?

03:33.520 --> 03:34.964
How do I know?

03:34.966 --> 03:37.753
- I've concerns about your...
- We've established that.

03:37.755 --> 03:39.863
I'll wait outside.

03:39.915 --> 03:41.597
With the gun.

04:06.112 --> 04:09.245
Nice work, Hardly Boy.

04:29.555 --> 04:31.597
You know what I love about this place?

04:31.599 --> 04:33.267
The view.

04:33.269 --> 04:35.515
- You like?
- Mm.

04:35.517 --> 04:37.969
I do. Stunning.

04:37.971 --> 04:39.843
Thank you, baby.

04:39.845 --> 04:43.012
we should get changed cos we
do have a party to go to.

04:44.054 --> 04:47.782
But take your time because
I also like the view.

04:57.563 --> 04:58.890
What?

04:58.893 --> 05:01.003
I missed you.

05:01.799 --> 05:03.707
They always do.

05:03.709 --> 05:06.775
And yet, in the midst
of all that missing,

05:06.777 --> 05:08.820
you chose to sleep on my couch.

05:08.822 --> 05:10.797
A couch much too small

05:10.799 --> 05:13.490
for all that sexy
goodness, I might add.

05:14.584 --> 05:16.166
I was trying to be honorable.

05:16.168 --> 05:17.701
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

05:17.703 --> 05:22.013
I appreciate that, but you
know in this day and age,

05:22.015 --> 05:26.036
a boy can actually be honorable
by simply giving a girl

05:26.038 --> 05:29.308
a few orgasms before
taking one for himself.

05:29.310 --> 05:32.718
I've always thought the old
version of honor was overrated.

05:32.720 --> 05:34.661
I completely agree.

05:34.663 --> 05:36.911
I ordered you some things.

05:38.106 --> 05:40.013
I have my own clothes, Lenny.

05:40.015 --> 05:41.820
You didn't need to do that.

05:41.822 --> 05:44.138
But we don't need here,
you know that...

05:45.538 --> 05:47.820
..only want.

05:47.822 --> 05:50.104
And I wanted to.

05:51.095 --> 05:54.417
Shirts first, please. Slowly please.

05:57.674 --> 06:01.252
I told her I couldn't do it anymore.
Because I couldn't.

06:04.323 --> 06:06.462
It's a start.

06:08.300 --> 06:10.916
I think she was surprised by it all.

06:10.918 --> 06:13.023
Maybe because she was
always the one leaving,

06:13.025 --> 06:15.080
and I always let her come back.

06:17.003 --> 06:19.754
We can do better.

06:24.447 --> 06:27.675
She should have known, though.
Ever since Monaco,

06:27.677 --> 06:29.986
and seeing you at the funeral,

06:31.484 --> 06:33.249
it's been you.

06:37.908 --> 06:39.572
It's always been you.

06:44.708 --> 06:45.929
Perfect.

06:47.460 --> 06:50.008
The shirt, I mean, of course.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.064
But your story was cute, too.

06:54.667 --> 06:56.738
By the way, the first one was fine,

06:56.740 --> 06:58.404
I was just enjoying the show.

07:06.949 --> 07:10.340
Do you need anything before your visit
to Parliament today, Your Majesty?

07:10.342 --> 07:12.104
Another pair of knickers.

07:12.106 --> 07:15.055
Simon's monument is nearly finished.

07:15.057 --> 07:17.091
It's very nice.

07:17.093 --> 07:18.584
It represents him well.

07:18.586 --> 07:22.350
And it represents the Queen well.
The people approve.

07:22.352 --> 07:24.284
That's not why I commissioned it.

07:24.286 --> 07:25.878
Simon was a good man.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.745
He cared immensely about the kingdom.

07:27.747 --> 07:30.289
Time should acknowledge that.

07:30.291 --> 07:32.766
Of course, Your Majesty.

07:32.768 --> 07:36.125
Rachel? Is Cyrus back yet?

07:36.127 --> 07:39.280
I believe His Majesty is still
meeting with the Prime Minister.

07:39.282 --> 07:42.130
Yes. Or so he'd like you to think.

07:50.953 --> 07:55.073
There was a time when people had the
civility to mind their own business.

07:55.075 --> 07:58.857
When people had the civility not to have
sex with a married man and lie about it.

07:58.859 --> 08:02.182
So Holloway rolled over, eh?
He's good at that.

08:02.184 --> 08:04.116
Well, now you know.

08:04.117 --> 08:05.659
What do I know?

08:05.662 --> 08:08.172
You're laying in some tube
like Michael Jackson.

08:08.174 --> 08:10.209
Work it out, Bubbles.

08:10.211 --> 08:13.061
I have cancer... of the balls.

08:13.063 --> 08:14.351
Testicular cancer?

08:14.354 --> 08:17.814
No, lung cancer in my balls.
Yes, testicular cancer.

08:17.816 --> 08:20.802
And I was getting treatment the
night my brother was stabbed.

08:20.804 --> 08:24.673
That's why I looked like
shit in the safe room.

08:26.373 --> 08:28.136
How bad is it?

08:28.138 --> 08:30.139
Who the hell knows?

08:30.141 --> 08:33.703
But you listen to me, no-one
is to know about this.

08:33.706 --> 08:35.605
Do you understand me?

08:35.607 --> 08:37.609
- I need to tell Eleanor.
- No-one.

08:37.611 --> 08:39.203
I won't lie to her.

08:39.206 --> 08:43.296
Fine, tell your evil twin,
but it goes no further.

08:43.298 --> 08:46.776
Why not? People might actually
cut you a break if they knew.

08:46.778 --> 08:48.864
That's exactly what I don't want.

08:48.866 --> 08:51.071
God forbid they look at me like that.

08:51.073 --> 08:53.838
With sympathy or pity.
People are such dicks.

08:54.587 --> 08:56.724
Let me get this straight.

08:56.726 --> 08:59.916
You'd rather be considered prime
suspect in your brother's murder,

08:59.918 --> 09:02.632
than have people sympathize
with your illness?

09:02.664 --> 09:08.556
Let me see. Reputed
murderer or pitiful victim.

09:11.368 --> 09:13.399
I'll take murderer.

09:13.401 --> 09:15.177
I'll take all you've got.

09:15.179 --> 09:17.548
Not a word.

09:33.695 --> 09:35.989
So Cyrus has cancer?

09:36.368 --> 09:39.492
And an alibi apparently for the
night my father was attacked.

09:39.494 --> 09:41.542
I've been thinking about that.

09:41.544 --> 09:43.387
The night the King was attacked.

09:43.389 --> 09:45.095
What if no one saw anything

09:45.097 --> 09:46.736
because there was nothing to see?

09:46.738 --> 09:48.307
I don't follow.

09:48.309 --> 09:50.426
Based on how much blood the King lost,

09:50.428 --> 09:52.578
we know approximately
where he was attacked,

09:52.580 --> 09:55.414
the thought being that he
couldn't have gotten very far.

09:55.416 --> 09:58.216
What if he stayed on his feet
much longer than anyone thinks?

09:58.218 --> 10:00.608
And everyone's been looking
in the wrong place.

10:00.610 --> 10:02.350
It couldn't hurt to expand the area.

10:02.352 --> 10:05.904
I can get security footage, surveillance
cameras. Even if it seems impossible.

10:05.906 --> 10:07.714
Thank you.

10:07.716 --> 10:09.593
It's good having you here.

10:09.595 --> 10:11.643
Yeah, well, try telling
that to Eleanor.

10:11.645 --> 10:15.300
I went to see her to
tell her I was back

10:15.302 --> 10:18.101
- and apologize.
- And?

10:18.104 --> 10:20.697
She just looked at me like
she wanted to kill me.

10:20.699 --> 10:23.568
Yeah, I've seen that look.

10:23.570 --> 10:25.926
I mean, I get it. I screwed up.

10:25.928 --> 10:27.634
You slept with our mother.

10:28.661 --> 10:30.402
I didn't exactly sleep with her.

10:30.404 --> 10:32.229
Dear God, stop talking.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.467
OK, fine.

10:34.469 --> 10:36.415
But I just want the chance

10:36.417 --> 10:38.396
to be able and make things right.

10:38.398 --> 10:40.241
Good luck with that.

10:43.011 --> 10:45.537
We're meeting up today on
my friend Holden's yacht.

10:45.539 --> 10:48.339
He was just in Japan opening
a club, but he's back now.

10:48.341 --> 10:50.013
Maybe you can talk with her there.

10:55.961 --> 10:57.804
Change of plans.

10:57.806 --> 10:59.478
She's bringing someone.

10:59.480 --> 11:01.459
Who?

11:01.461 --> 11:03.594
Beck?

11:05.186 --> 11:06.755
Beck.

11:08.090 --> 11:09.489
Who are you?

11:09.491 --> 11:12.701
Agent Hill, Your Highness. James Hill.

11:12.703 --> 11:15.810
I've been assigned to lead your
security detail until further notice.

11:15.812 --> 11:18.304
Have you? We'll see about that.

11:19.501 --> 11:24.146
Well, come in... Mr. Hill,
let's have a look at you.

11:37.593 --> 11:40.512
You're a bit of a silvery fox, Mr.
Hill.

11:40.514 --> 11:42.494
What's your story?

11:42.496 --> 11:44.800
27 years with Scotland Yard, ma'am.

11:44.802 --> 11:46.013
And then?

11:46.015 --> 11:48.200
Four hours with you, Your Highness.

11:48.202 --> 11:51.959
A little old for a change of
venue, aren't we, Mr. Fox?

11:51.961 --> 11:54.009
I'm incredibly old, ma'am.

11:54.011 --> 11:56.366
One foot in the grave, Your Highness.

11:57.769 --> 12:00.449
OK, well, here's the rundown.

12:00.451 --> 12:03.268
Firstly, do not call me ma'am.

12:03.270 --> 12:05.130
- Ever.
- As you wish.

12:05.132 --> 12:09.486
Also, what happens with me and my world

12:09.488 --> 12:11.212
stays with me and my world.

12:11.214 --> 12:13.040
Are you comfortable with that?

12:13.042 --> 12:16.866
If Your Highness is referring to the three
or four ounces of cocaine on her vanity,

12:16.868 --> 12:18.472
the marijuana on her coffee table,

12:18.474 --> 12:20.146
or the excessive abundance of MDMA,

12:20.148 --> 12:22.845
my job is to protect you

12:22.847 --> 12:25.784
and secure your ability to pass
safely to and from the palace,

12:25.786 --> 12:28.415
not to judge you, Your Highness.

12:28.417 --> 12:29.542
No.

12:29.544 --> 12:32.891
- However...
- Careful... Mr. Hill.

12:32.893 --> 12:35.317
..there's a wealth of drugs
in London these days.

12:35.319 --> 12:37.162
It's become fairly common.

12:37.164 --> 12:39.930
Your Highness strikes me
as anything but common.

12:40.888 --> 12:42.082
Noted.

12:42.084 --> 12:45.738
Let's begin with an easy
one, then, shall we?

12:45.740 --> 12:48.266
Have you seen Beck?

12:48.268 --> 12:54.245
Lord Twysden Beckwith II is currently
in the staff kitchen preparing bacon.

12:55.067 --> 12:56.603
Nobody calls him that.

12:56.605 --> 12:59.405
With all due respect, if
I was called Twysden,

12:59.407 --> 13:01.353
I'd probably go with Beck as well.

13:02.925 --> 13:07.023
There's a slight chance that
you might amuse me, Mr. Hill.

13:07.026 --> 13:17.547
So I'm going to give you a chance.

13:17.549 --> 13:19.290
Eventually you'll let me
down bBut it a shot. Does.

13:20.471 --> 13:22.605
Hm?

13:22.607 --> 13:24.688
Off you go.

13:28.568 --> 13:30.121
Mr. Hill

13:30.123 --> 13:32.273
one other thing.

13:33.266 --> 13:34.870
What's your take on Cyrus?

13:34.872 --> 13:36.886
- My take, Your Highness?
- The King.

13:36.888 --> 13:38.697
What do you think about him?

13:38.699 --> 13:40.337
I have a great deal of respect

13:40.339 --> 13:42.318
for His Majesty the King. Officially.

13:42.321 --> 13:45.018
- And unofficially?
- Unofficially...

13:45.976 --> 13:47.717
I miss your father.

13:49.393 --> 13:51.954
You can call me Len.

13:51.956 --> 13:54.721
How about I earn that privilege?

14:11.550 --> 14:13.171
You can't be serious.

14:13.173 --> 14:16.144
I'm wearing it to the opening
of Parliament today.

14:16.146 --> 14:17.921
The Koh-I-Noor?

14:17.923 --> 14:20.073
- And what about the curse?
- Oh, yes.

14:20.075 --> 14:21.611
The curse.

14:21.613 --> 14:24.379
"He who owns the diamond
will own the world,

14:24.381 --> 14:26.839
but will also know its misfortunes.

14:26.841 --> 14:30.358
Only God or a woman can
wear it with impunity."

14:30.360 --> 14:32.647
Clearly invented by a woman.

14:32.649 --> 14:35.244
- Or God.
- Boring.

14:35.246 --> 14:38.438
Besides, of all the things
I'm afraid of, if any,

14:38.440 --> 14:42.334
some ancient curse by a bunch
of sun-worshipping dum-dums

14:42.336 --> 14:44.264
doesn't chart.

14:44.266 --> 14:47.851
Well, to be safe, maybe
I should wear it today.

14:47.853 --> 14:50.568
Nice try.

14:50.570 --> 14:53.284
But the Grand Duchess is right.

14:53.286 --> 14:54.924
Diamonds don't suit you.

14:54.926 --> 14:56.974
I didn't come here to squabble.

14:56.976 --> 14:58.888
We need to pick a
parliamentary hostage.

14:58.890 --> 15:01.176
- Are we still doing that?
- It's tradition.

15:01.178 --> 15:03.226
We take a member of Parliament hostage

15:03.228 --> 15:04.969
until the King has made his speech

15:04.971 --> 15:06.883
and is returned safely to the palace.

15:06.885 --> 15:09.343
It's your coming-out party.

15:09.345 --> 15:10.846
As if you needed one.

15:10.848 --> 15:14.519
It's ceremonial. I hate ceremony.

15:15.461 --> 15:16.791
But now that you mention it,

15:16.793 --> 15:20.106
I know just the hostage worth taking.

15:21.149 --> 15:23.522
Mr. Holloway. We've come for you.

15:24.464 --> 15:25.743
Yes!

15:25.745 --> 15:27.553
Damn. I was hoping it would be me.

15:27.555 --> 15:30.732
Last year they had quite a
spread for the hostage.

15:30.734 --> 15:33.772
I heard they had Portuguese tarts.

15:33.774 --> 15:36.369
Ooh, Portuguese tarts!

15:36.371 --> 15:39.102
Gentlemen, I am your willing hostage.

15:40.642 --> 15:42.007
Easy.

15:42.009 --> 15:43.510
A little rough.

15:43.512 --> 15:46.517
Relax, Holloway. It's ceremonial.

15:46.519 --> 15:49.147
- Yeah.
- I love those tarts...

15:49.149 --> 15:50.514
I love the pies.

15:50.516 --> 15:52.564
Well, gentlemen, there's none for you.

15:52.566 --> 15:54.170
It's all for me.

15:54.172 --> 15:55.691
Ha ha ha!

15:55.693 --> 15:58.185
His Majesty will arrive shortly.

15:58.187 --> 15:59.944
Lucius?

15:59.946 --> 16:02.899
Tell His Majesty not to be late.

16:02.902 --> 16:06.402
After all, some of us
have a country to run.

16:16.722 --> 16:19.557
Ah! Cor!

16:21.643 --> 16:23.486
Delicious.

16:23.488 --> 16:26.014
Sumptuous.

16:26.016 --> 16:27.791
Tasty.

16:27.793 --> 16:31.139
Ooh, I do love a Portuguese tart.

16:32.678 --> 16:34.590
Well, come on, then.
Take the cuffs off.

16:34.592 --> 16:35.991
Hello, James.

16:35.993 --> 16:38.724
Your Majesty. Thank
you for selecting me

16:38.726 --> 16:41.321
- as this year's hostage.
- You're welcome.

16:41.323 --> 16:43.388
But then, this isn't the first time

16:43.390 --> 16:46.104
you've been in handcuffs
in my bedroom, is it?

16:46.106 --> 16:48.667
- Ahem.
- Look.

16:48.669 --> 16:50.904
They've prepared all the pastries.

16:50.906 --> 16:52.527
And fruits.

16:53.487 --> 16:55.671
All the rage, I'm told.

16:57.416 --> 16:59.053
Urgh!

16:59.055 --> 17:02.197
I do love a custard tart. Mm.

17:02.199 --> 17:04.828
Do you know what I don't love so much?

17:05.752 --> 17:09.098
A squawking tart. Gentlemen?

17:09.101 --> 17:10.808
Agh!

17:10.810 --> 17:14.087
Cyrus... Look, I can explain.

17:14.089 --> 17:16.752
You will address me as
His Majesty the King,

17:16.753 --> 17:18.425
or I will have you court-martialed.

17:18.428 --> 17:20.442
Do you understand me?

17:20.444 --> 17:22.851
Yes, Your Majesty.

17:22.853 --> 17:24.371
Urgh!

17:24.373 --> 17:26.319
Liam came to see me today.

17:26.320 --> 17:29.872
Apparently, a little bird
told him some things.

17:29.874 --> 17:33.870
Do you know where little
birds belong, Mr. Holloway?

17:34.931 --> 17:37.185
In a cage.

17:38.536 --> 17:40.327
Come on, you must be joking, Cyrus.

17:40.329 --> 17:41.917
- Agh!
- In you get.

17:41.919 --> 17:45.761
- Argh!
- Get in there. Squawker.

17:45.763 --> 17:46.888
Cyrus!

17:46.890 --> 17:48.869
Your Majesty.

17:48.872 --> 17:51.945
Look, I can explain! I can explain.

17:51.947 --> 17:54.473
I've lined your cage with newspapers,

17:54.475 --> 17:56.472
in case you need to take a shit.

17:56.474 --> 17:59.564
Please aim for the Daily Mail.

18:00.420 --> 18:02.537
You can't leave me like this!

18:02.539 --> 18:03.767
Cyrus!

18:03.769 --> 18:06.637
Your Majesty! This was
supposed to be ceremonial!

18:06.639 --> 18:08.601
Ceremonial!

18:08.603 --> 18:10.326
Mm!

18:12.583 --> 18:14.768
Henstridge, you handsome bastard.

18:14.770 --> 18:16.084
You're back.

18:16.086 --> 18:18.561
I'm back. Get up here.

18:18.563 --> 18:20.235
I'm here, too.

18:20.237 --> 18:22.319
Someone get me a bow and arrow.

18:22.321 --> 18:24.233
Look who I found.

18:24.235 --> 18:26.077
Beck. Good to see you.

18:26.079 --> 18:29.717
- Lenny, you got a sec?
- Yeah. I have heaps of secs.

18:29.719 --> 18:31.340
But first I need a drink. Several.

18:31.342 --> 18:32.911
We'll talk in a bit, yeah?

18:32.913 --> 18:34.483
- Holden!
- Lenny!

18:34.485 --> 18:37.455
You have far too many clothes on.

18:37.457 --> 18:38.771
Get up here!

18:38.773 --> 18:40.906
James Hill.

18:40.908 --> 18:43.298
- Jasper Frost.
- I know.

18:43.300 --> 18:44.938
Interesting service record.

18:44.940 --> 18:46.544
Interesting invasion of privacy.

18:46.546 --> 18:48.184
You plan on doing your job?

18:48.186 --> 18:49.721
No one wants the old guy there.

18:49.723 --> 18:51.874
Someone needs to be
protecting the Princess.

18:51.876 --> 18:53.446
She's on a boat.

18:53.448 --> 18:55.905
Who's going to attack her? The fish?

18:55.907 --> 18:57.409
What about the people?

18:57.411 --> 18:59.938
I vetted everyone in attendance.
She's fine.

18:59.940 --> 19:01.748
Someone needs to keep an eye on her?

19:01.750 --> 19:03.678
That's what you're here for, kid.

19:04.518 --> 19:06.002
If I look after the Princess,

19:06.004 --> 19:08.685
you won't have an excuse
to talk to her, will you?

19:10.224 --> 19:13.810
Have you seen the face on
that Beckwith character?

19:14.837 --> 19:16.714
Kid almost turned me.

19:17.706 --> 19:19.618
Good luck.

19:41.993 --> 19:45.230
We'll have another committee room.

19:45.243 --> 19:48.254
There. That can be done.

19:49.114 --> 19:50.930
Prime Minister?

19:52.546 --> 19:54.190
You're easy to spot.

19:54.192 --> 19:55.769
I can see your panty line.

19:57.109 --> 19:59.543
I'm joking, Prime Minister.

19:59.545 --> 20:01.260
But... are you wearing them?

20:01.262 --> 20:03.352
No. Of course not.

20:03.355 --> 20:05.514
Opening of Parliament.

20:05.516 --> 20:07.401
So it begins.

20:07.403 --> 20:09.598
Indeed. And your first
order of business

20:09.600 --> 20:12.394
- will be to pass our bill.
- Understood.

20:12.396 --> 20:14.779
But even if we change the
order of succession,

20:14.781 --> 20:16.529
what of the King's daughters?

20:16.532 --> 20:19.549
Without a declaration of
incapacity, they're still in line.

20:19.551 --> 20:21.522
That's being taken care of.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.652
I think we should spend
more time apart.

20:26.654 --> 20:29.501
And I think that that is OK

20:29.503 --> 20:32.005
because we're not the people
that we used to be anymore.

20:32.007 --> 20:33.721
I'm the next Queen of England,

20:33.723 --> 20:35.883
and you're about to be
a whole new person,

20:35.885 --> 20:38.491
thanks to hours of
ill-advised plastic surgery.

20:38.493 --> 20:42.746
Maybe... Maybe we should...

20:42.748 --> 20:45.800
I don't know, like, get boyfriends.

20:47.551 --> 20:49.677
Maybe I already
have a boyfriend.

20:49.679 --> 20:52.354
Bloody hell, what's with the voice?

20:52.356 --> 20:55.854
I decided my new look should
have a new voice. This is it.

20:55.856 --> 20:57.604
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure

20:57.606 --> 20:59.491
the Elephant Man didn't
sound like that.

20:59.493 --> 21:01.894
Like, you definitely need to slur more.

21:01.896 --> 21:04.192
Maybe I already
have a boyfriend.

21:05.223 --> 21:07.829
Have you considered that I
might actually look better?

21:07.832 --> 21:09.752
Yeah. Sure thing, Donatella.

21:10.302 --> 21:15.036
Well, I think my new man is
going to like me, no matter what.

21:26.122 --> 21:29.173
The Chief of Defense Staff
to see you, Your Majesty.

21:34.150 --> 21:35.711
General.

21:35.713 --> 21:38.266
Your Majesty, may I present you with...

21:38.268 --> 21:40.222
The Great Sword of State.

21:40.224 --> 21:42.522
Very nice.

21:42.524 --> 21:44.923
Should go nicely with the Koh-I-Noor.

21:44.925 --> 21:47.120
You're wearing the Koh-I-Noor?
But the curse!

21:47.122 --> 21:50.105
You should concern yourself
with our diminishing forces

21:50.107 --> 21:51.821
and rising anti-war sentiment.

21:53.435 --> 21:56.041
There used to be a time when
we actually used one of these.

21:56.043 --> 21:58.752
Yes. Shame those days are gone.

22:01.414 --> 22:03.591
Planning a coup?

22:03.593 --> 22:05.547
Come in, Prime Minister.

22:05.549 --> 22:07.211
I'll allow it.

22:07.213 --> 22:08.977
You'll allow it?

22:08.980 --> 22:11.963
With all due respect, Your Majesty,

22:11.965 --> 22:13.954
some of us here have a purpose,

22:13.956 --> 22:17.248
whilst others are simply
ceremonial figureheads.

22:17.250 --> 22:18.894
Ceremonial figureheads

22:18.896 --> 22:20.919
who happen to control your destiny.

22:22.328 --> 22:26.067
The Death Warrant of King Charles I.

22:26.069 --> 22:28.760
For over 300 years it's been here,

22:28.762 --> 22:30.528
a silent reminder

22:30.530 --> 22:33.684
of what happens to those
monarchs who oppress England.

22:33.686 --> 22:35.675
When you next see James Holloway,

22:35.677 --> 22:38.232
you might ask him how that's going?

22:42.231 --> 22:45.934
Don't get your knickers in
a twist, Prime Minister.

22:49.591 --> 22:51.494
What the hell did he mean by that?

22:51.496 --> 22:53.243
It's merely an expression.

23:11.398 --> 23:13.077
Are you sure?

23:13.079 --> 23:15.513
That's what he said. Cancer.

23:15.515 --> 23:17.401
In his balls?

23:17.404 --> 23:18.945
That's awesome.

23:18.947 --> 23:21.279
I'm sorry, I mean, it's not, but...

23:21.281 --> 23:23.509
- It's Cyrus.
- It's Cyrus.

23:23.511 --> 23:26.495
It does explain where he
might have gone that night.

23:26.497 --> 23:28.725
And why he was so ill in the safe room.

23:28.727 --> 23:31.298
Yeah. I've been going
over it, you know?

23:33.256 --> 23:36.257
Liam... all your friends are here.

23:36.259 --> 23:39.020
Look, Holden's home, and Beck.

23:39.022 --> 23:41.456
Will you try and have
some fun today, OK?

23:42.624 --> 23:44.167
Yeah. OK.

23:44.169 --> 23:45.951
OK.

23:49.144 --> 23:52.230
- How's he doing?
- He's a mess. We all are.

23:52.233 --> 23:54.770
Will this help?

23:54.772 --> 23:59.093
Probably not, Holden,
but let's find out.

24:01.669 --> 24:05.785
We haven't met. I'm Beck.
Friend of the family's.

24:08.892 --> 24:10.571
How long have you been with Liam?

24:10.573 --> 24:12.579
Not long.

24:12.581 --> 24:14.242
I was with the Princess before that.

24:15.534 --> 24:17.278
I wouldn't take that personally.

24:17.280 --> 24:20.538
Eleanor's security detail is
considered a temporary position.

24:20.540 --> 24:22.168
No one lasts more than a month.

24:23.148 --> 24:25.033
I was with her for six.

24:25.385 --> 24:27.349
Right up until Monaco.

24:44.623 --> 24:47.180
Didn't you see me? I
was Beck-oning you.

24:47.182 --> 24:49.970
You know you should approach
when summoned, Beckwith.

24:49.972 --> 24:51.494
I am a princess, you know.

24:51.496 --> 24:53.822
Are you rolling?

24:55.228 --> 24:58.496
A little. More like bouncing, actually.

24:58.498 --> 25:01.765
What am I getting
myself into, Princess?

25:01.767 --> 25:05.257
Er... me, if you're lucky.

25:05.259 --> 25:07.962
You know who I am, Beck.

25:07.964 --> 25:09.776
Yes.

25:09.778 --> 25:12.549
I also know who you can be.

25:13.750 --> 25:15.870
I'm going dancing.

25:15.872 --> 25:18.026
You'd be wise to join me.

25:19.262 --> 25:21.793
♪ Work hard or it will
be the end of you ♪

25:21.795 --> 25:25.233
♪ You say you won't
although you want to ♪

25:25.235 --> 25:29.136
♪ Work hard or it will
be the end of you ♪

25:41.566 --> 25:44.868
- Nice suit.
- You, too.

25:44.870 --> 25:47.572
- You didn't even look.
- White top, white sarong,

25:47.574 --> 25:50.687
gold platform heels and a shark
tattoo on your right foot.

25:50.690 --> 25:52.365
It's a dolphin.

25:52.367 --> 25:54.385
I stand corrected.

25:54.387 --> 25:55.994
Hm.

25:55.996 --> 25:57.638
Do you carry a gun?

25:58.872 --> 26:01.301
Because maybe we could go below deck.

26:01.303 --> 26:03.012
You could hold me at gunpoint

26:03.014 --> 26:06.162
and force me to do whatever you wanted.

26:06.164 --> 26:08.114
What would your husband say about that?

26:09.109 --> 26:10.716
Oh...

26:10.718 --> 26:12.701
You should have taken
your wedding band off

26:12.703 --> 26:14.789
before you got a spray
tan for the party.

26:14.791 --> 26:16.673
Wow.

26:16.675 --> 26:18.864
I guess you have all the answers,

26:18.866 --> 26:20.644
don't you, James Bond?

26:20.646 --> 26:22.972
Not all of them.

26:32.013 --> 26:34.475
What's the deal with
this Beck character?

26:34.477 --> 26:36.188
I know it's not what you want to hear,

26:36.190 --> 26:37.933
but Beck's a good guy.

26:37.935 --> 26:41.049
We've known him a long time.
He's always been there for Len.

26:42.557 --> 26:43.993
Yeah.

26:47.590 --> 26:49.881
'How's life with
Cyrus treating you?'

26:49.883 --> 26:53.065
King Cyrus, and very well.

26:53.615 --> 26:56.934
You used to be Team Helena.
Why the switch?

26:56.936 --> 26:58.920
What does he have on you?

26:59.915 --> 27:02.549
My loyalties lie with the monarchy.

27:04.009 --> 27:08.081
King Simon didn't need me.
King Cyrus does.

27:10.138 --> 27:12.190
Where does he go, our King,

27:12.192 --> 27:14.347
when he's away from the palace?

27:15.307 --> 27:19.362
His Majesty has a very busy schedule.
Many meetings.

27:20.614 --> 27:22.666
He's also not too pleased

27:22.668 --> 27:26.260
about your recent alliance
with the Prime Minister.

27:26.262 --> 27:28.178
I bet.

27:28.180 --> 27:32.081
Her Majesty should be more
transparent with her agenda.

27:32.083 --> 27:35.213
Oh, come on, sweet Lu,
you know how this works.

27:36.294 --> 27:39.030
Helena has her agenda
and your man has his.

27:39.032 --> 27:41.119
And maybe ours is misguided.

27:41.121 --> 27:44.987
But if it's not, and Helena
becomes the monarch,

27:44.989 --> 27:47.008
where will you be?

27:49.574 --> 27:51.985
You do realize that something

27:51.988 --> 27:54.469
would have to befall King Cyrus

27:54.471 --> 27:57.891
for Her majesty's
succession plan to work.

27:57.893 --> 27:59.330
I do.

28:00.769 --> 28:02.462
But then you never know,

28:02.464 --> 28:06.023
I suppose it depends on
how those meetings go.

28:08.832 --> 28:11.671
I'd better go. The Queen
has a meeting with the PM

28:11.673 --> 28:13.691
and we have a succession bill to pass.

28:20.571 --> 28:22.418
Mr. Prime Minister?

28:56.399 --> 28:58.619
Rachel.

29:00.439 --> 29:02.136
Yes, Your Majesty?

29:03.040 --> 29:05.261
- Is he...?
- Yes. Dead.

29:05.834 --> 29:07.122
I see.

29:07.513 --> 29:08.709
Did you kill him?

29:10.763 --> 29:12.562
- I'll notify the authorities.
- No.

29:12.913 --> 29:14.133
Not yet. Wait.

29:14.666 --> 29:16.459
He's wearing my knickers.

29:17.557 --> 29:22.479
Just when things were going well,

29:22.480 --> 29:25.993
the pie-eating fat bastard
dies and ruins everything.

29:25.994 --> 29:28.599
I mean, is it too much to ask that...

29:30.978 --> 29:34.781
That the man stays undead
until one little bill passes?

29:51.906 --> 29:53.184
Rachel.

29:52.118 --> 29:53.981
Rachel.

29:55.815 --> 29:57.473
For God's sake!

29:58.245 --> 30:00.074
Ahh!

30:01.445 --> 30:02.914
Right.

30:02.917 --> 30:04.489
Let's get out of here.

30:04.491 --> 30:07.364
Wait. We need to make him look normal.

30:07.366 --> 30:09.760
Close to normal. Trust me.

30:11.679 --> 30:14.312
All that hard work and now
we're back to square one.

30:14.314 --> 30:16.194
Just wait till Moorefield hears this.

30:16.196 --> 30:19.036
He's been whoring himself out
to a couple of halfwits.

30:19.238 --> 30:22.521
Button the pig's sash and let's go.

30:33.442 --> 30:35.083
Forgive me, Rachel.

30:35.085 --> 30:37.547
This must be the strangest
thing you've ever done.

30:37.549 --> 30:39.857
Oh, not even this week, Your Majesty.

30:54.988 --> 30:57.039
You think you're going
to get away with this?

30:57.041 --> 30:58.631
Yes, I do.

30:58.633 --> 31:01.986
Well, the Prime Minister is
going to hear all about it.

31:01.988 --> 31:04.125
The Prime Minister is dead.

31:05.102 --> 31:07.359
I assume this is news to you?

31:07.361 --> 31:10.542
Of course it is. The
Prime Minister is dead.

31:10.544 --> 31:12.493
Long live the Prime Minister.

31:14.925 --> 31:18.484
You know, you play your
cards right, Holloway,

31:18.486 --> 31:20.981
you might be the next PM.

31:20.983 --> 31:24.199
Oh, wait, I'd have to approve you.

31:24.201 --> 31:27.690
Too bad you couldn't keep
that blowhole of yours shut.

31:27.692 --> 31:30.908
Emphasis on "blow". Holl-away.

31:37.686 --> 31:39.054
Well?

31:39.056 --> 31:41.005
Well, what?

31:41.007 --> 31:43.504
You do understand we don't
kill people around here?

31:43.506 --> 31:45.660
I had nothing to do with it.

31:45.662 --> 31:49.527
Although it's understandable
his death would upset you,

31:49.529 --> 31:53.652
considering your plans to change the
order of succession are now derailed.

31:54.630 --> 31:56.441
Queen to square one.

31:56.443 --> 31:58.084
We'll see about that.

31:58.086 --> 32:00.548
Meet the new PM, same as the old PM.

32:00.550 --> 32:01.987
Good luck.

32:01.989 --> 32:05.990
By the way, I'm keeping
the Great Sword of State.

32:05.992 --> 32:07.822
I can do that now.

32:11.983 --> 32:15.505
Rachel, get me a meeting with
the Deputy Prime minister.

32:15.507 --> 32:18.552
Yes, Your Majesty.

32:27.967 --> 32:30.600
I see you took none of my advice.

32:32.502 --> 32:34.810
- Do you know why we do this?
- Do what?

32:34.812 --> 32:38.746
Chill on a boat and dance,

32:38.748 --> 32:41.759
and laugh with our friends
and waste the day.

32:43.403 --> 32:46.379
Because these are the days
that we can feel normal.

32:47.545 --> 32:49.904
We can't be normal, we never will be,

32:49.906 --> 32:56.168
but some days we can just
disappear for a while, you know?

32:58.326 --> 33:00.720
Fade into the music and the high

33:00.722 --> 33:03.612
and pretend we're not the
people we always will be.

33:04.761 --> 33:06.505
I promised Dad I'd avenge him.

33:06.507 --> 33:08.216
I know you did.

33:09.313 --> 33:11.639
But this anger, Liam,

33:11.641 --> 33:13.864
this quest for vengeance...

33:13.866 --> 33:16.876
I don't think Dad would
want that for you.

33:16.878 --> 33:19.921
And would he want me hanging
out on a boat getting high?

33:21.156 --> 33:22.831
He'd want you to be happy.

33:27.694 --> 33:29.676
I know you miss him.

33:30.808 --> 33:33.612
I do, too. Every day.

33:35.053 --> 33:37.241
And I'm not asking you to stop.

33:39.536 --> 33:42.511
You've been so strong, Liam.
I'm so proud of you.

33:44.328 --> 33:46.790
But there's a possibility
we'll never know who did it.

33:46.792 --> 33:48.262
Don't say that.

33:48.264 --> 33:51.206
Well, you know, we have to accept it.

33:52.440 --> 33:56.819
Just because we're royal doesn't
mean that we get to know.

34:01.510 --> 34:03.972
I want you to do something for me.

34:06.610 --> 34:11.159
You've been retracing Dad's steps
ever since the day he died.

34:13.130 --> 34:15.266
Retrace yours.

34:17.699 --> 34:20.436
Find that thing that made you happy

34:20.438 --> 34:22.746
and just disappear for a minute.

34:22.748 --> 34:24.628
Be someone else.

34:24.630 --> 34:27.452
All of this is still going to
be here when you come back.

34:32.246 --> 34:34.400
I couldn't do this without you.

34:36.661 --> 34:38.371
Of course you could.

34:40.289 --> 34:42.083
But you don't have to.

35:05.102 --> 35:08.865
Liam? We're gonna shoot Ashok
in the leg with a flare gun.

35:08.867 --> 35:11.534
- Do you want to watch?
- That's not true.

35:11.536 --> 35:13.125
I don't think.

35:13.127 --> 35:15.281
Was that an actual smile?

35:17.303 --> 35:19.371
I haven't been much of a friend today.

35:19.373 --> 35:21.116
That's not fair to you guys.

35:21.118 --> 35:22.622
It really is good to see you.

35:22.624 --> 35:24.744
Well, look, you be what you want to be.

35:24.746 --> 35:27.036
That's how it works. And we let you.

35:27.038 --> 35:29.158
It's been that way since prep school,

35:29.160 --> 35:30.973
and it always will be.

35:31.864 --> 35:34.565
I know. And I appreciate it.

35:35.697 --> 35:37.286
Next time we'll shoot Ashok.

35:37.289 --> 35:39.254
- Done.
- No, not done.

35:39.256 --> 35:41.890
- Not done at all.
- Let's give it a test run.

35:41.892 --> 35:44.011
Come on, take a step back.
It'll be quick.

35:51.576 --> 35:53.251
I need to do some things alone,

35:53.253 --> 35:54.928
and I need you trust me.

35:57.462 --> 35:59.479
Thanks. I'll be in touch.

36:01.980 --> 36:04.134
Jasper.

36:04.136 --> 36:06.050
Everyone lets her down.

36:07.078 --> 36:09.301
Be the one who changes that.

36:19.767 --> 36:22.023
'Breaking
news out of London.

36:22.025 --> 36:23.564
We now have confirmation

36:23.566 --> 36:26.713
that Prime Minister
David Edwards has died.

36:26.715 --> 36:29.844
His body was found this evening
at his office in Parliament.

36:29.846 --> 36:33.882
Police rushed to the scene
after receiving a 999 call.

36:33.884 --> 36:35.695
The area has been contained

36:35.697 --> 36:37.937
and is being treated as a crime scene,

36:37.939 --> 36:39.768
pending an investigation.

36:39.770 --> 36:42.814
The cause of death is as yet
unknown with an inquest to follow.

36:42.816 --> 36:45.979
This untimely death comes
as another tragic blow

36:45.981 --> 36:49.059
to Britain's public following
the death of Prince Robert

36:49.061 --> 36:50.719
and the murder of King Simon,

36:50.721 --> 36:52.516
whose killer remains at large.

36:52.518 --> 36:55.391
As of now, plans for the
King's memorial dedication

36:55.393 --> 36:57.068
remain intact.

36:57.070 --> 36:59.549
More on this story as details develop.'

37:16.679 --> 37:18.867
It won't change anything.

37:19.998 --> 37:21.673
It might fool a few people,

37:21.675 --> 37:23.521
but it won't fool your children.

37:24.926 --> 37:27.354
This monument is about memorializing

37:27.356 --> 37:29.955
your father's relationship
with his kingdom,

37:29.957 --> 37:32.179
it's not about repairing ours.

37:34.371 --> 37:36.422
I really hope that's true.

37:50.251 --> 37:52.781
Mr. Hill, my new shadow.

37:54.033 --> 37:56.956
I appreciate your giving
me some space today.

37:56.958 --> 37:59.728
And you never actually
answered my question.

37:59.730 --> 38:01.610
What happened after so many years

38:01.612 --> 38:03.664
that meant you had to change careers?

38:03.666 --> 38:05.547
I'll tell you what.

38:05.549 --> 38:08.182
You guess it, and I'll
tell you all about it.

38:10.511 --> 38:14.324
There's a slight chance that
you might amuse me, Mr. Hill.

38:15.353 --> 38:17.045
Good night, Princess.

38:22.214 --> 38:24.197
Interesting work.

38:24.199 --> 38:26.798
Is there an artist's tale behind it?

38:30.668 --> 38:34.532
The artist got angry at her parents,

38:34.534 --> 38:36.347
kind of lost her mind...

38:37.307 --> 38:39.427
..lashed out like she does...

38:40.421 --> 38:42.643
..and couldn't take it back.

38:42.645 --> 38:43.841
Why not?

38:45.485 --> 38:47.571
Because her father died.

38:50.413 --> 38:52.362
Her supposed father.

38:56.351 --> 38:58.043
Don't drink that.

39:03.589 --> 39:05.521
Len...

39:08.825 --> 39:11.150
The last time you and I
were alone together,

39:11.152 --> 39:13.341
you asked me to be sober and I did it.

39:13.343 --> 39:14.777
For you.

39:16.559 --> 39:18.902
And now you're going to
do some things for me.

39:19.948 --> 39:21.725
And to me.

39:27.202 --> 39:28.843
Eleanor.

39:30.077 --> 39:31.992
I like it when you say my name.

39:33.054 --> 39:34.832
Eleanor.

39:40.515 --> 39:42.259
Say it again.

39:42.261 --> 39:43.798
Eleanor.

39:46.332 --> 39:48.059
Pull my hair.

39:50.131 --> 39:52.320
Shhh. Wait.

39:52.322 --> 39:54.133
My turn.

39:54.135 --> 39:56.187
I just want to look at you.

40:04.300 --> 40:06.864
Wait. You're always going so fast.

40:10.306 --> 40:12.545
You need to slow down, Princess.

40:13.573 --> 40:15.420
You need to slow me down.

40:15.422 --> 40:17.130
Oh, I plan to.

40:21.274 --> 40:23.428
I met this girl in Monaco.

40:24.764 --> 40:27.123
I took her hand and then
we jumped into the pool,

40:28.461 --> 40:30.717
and when we surfaced, we kissed.

40:32.088 --> 40:34.207
And that day, it was enough.

40:35.373 --> 40:37.870
Tonight... it's not enough.

40:40.130 --> 40:42.523
I was hoping you'd say that.

40:42.525 --> 40:44.251
There hasn't been a day since then

40:44.253 --> 40:46.186
that I haven't wanted this.

40:50.945 --> 40:52.585
The bad news is...

40:52.587 --> 40:54.569
that I plan to take my time.

40:57.275 --> 41:00.422
The good news is, we have all night.

41:01.417 --> 41:03.485
And I plan to use it.

41:32.524 --> 41:34.609
We'll avenge you, sir.

41:37.486 --> 41:39.743
Nothing happened, by the way.

41:39.745 --> 41:42.720
I wore the stone and
nothing bad came to pass.

41:43.122 --> 41:45.482
Tell that to the Prime Minister.

41:49.385 --> 41:53.079
Forgive me, Your Majesty,
but your doctor called.

41:53.081 --> 41:55.988
He needs to see you at once.
It's urgent.

42:11.904 --> 42:13.750
Excuse me, Deputy Prime Minister,

42:13.752 --> 42:15.153
but the palace are calling.

42:15.155 --> 42:16.966
The Queen is commanding an audience.

42:17.926 --> 42:20.492
Tell her I'll think about
it and let her know.

42:20.494 --> 42:22.340
I'm sorry?

42:22.342 --> 42:24.547
I'm the acting Prime Minister.

42:24.549 --> 42:26.754
I don't have time for
tea with the Queen,

42:26.756 --> 42:29.697
and I certainly don't have
time to repeat myself.

42:29.699 --> 42:31.647
Yes, ma'am.

42:56.710 --> 42:58.380
Hi.
