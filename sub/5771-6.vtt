WEBVTT

00:05.539 --> 00:06.707
HEY, DANNY,
YOUR SANDWICH HAS BEEN

00:06.740 --> 00:08.276
IN THE FRIDGE
FOR, LIKE, A MONTH.

00:08.309 --> 00:09.310
I'M TAKING IT HOME
FOR DINNER.
DOWN, GET DOWN. SHH.

00:09.343 --> 00:10.311
WAIT, WHAT?

00:10.344 --> 00:11.345
WAIT, WHAT'S HAPPENING?
SHOULD I GET MY TASER?

00:11.379 --> 00:13.347
OSAMA.

00:15.149 --> 00:16.517
GREAT, MINDY,
YOU GOT ME KILLED.

00:16.550 --> 00:17.718
OKAY, CAN I JUST SAY--

00:17.751 --> 00:19.587
IT IS SO UNFAIR
THAT IT'S COOL FOR YOU

00:19.620 --> 00:21.822
TO DO ALL THIS DUMB STUFF, BUT
I JUST WANTED ALL THE DOCTORS

00:21.855 --> 00:24.158
TO SING ONE BIRTHDAY VIDEO
FOR MEREDITH VIEIRA,

00:24.192 --> 00:25.326
AND SUDDENLY
"IT'S A WORKPLACE."

00:25.359 --> 00:27.361
IT'S AFTER HOURS.
THERE'S DIFFERENT RULES.

00:27.395 --> 00:29.330
AAH!
[firing toy gun]

00:29.363 --> 00:30.364
WHERE'S PETER?
WHERE'S PETER?

00:30.398 --> 00:31.599
I'M RIGHT HERE.
PUT THE GUN DOWN,

00:31.632 --> 00:33.101
OR SHE GETS IT.
AAH! AAH!

00:33.134 --> 00:34.435
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO IT.
I WILL KILL THIS OLD LADY.

00:34.468 --> 00:36.337
EXCUSE ME?
SHE'S PUSHING 55,

00:36.370 --> 00:37.605
AND THAT'S
A TERRIBLE DAY TO DIE.

00:37.638 --> 00:39.173
NO, THAT'S NOT--I'M NOT.
I'M YOUNG.

00:39.207 --> 00:41.109
DROP THE GUN.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S--

00:41.142 --> 00:43.311
HEY. WHERE ARE YOU
JUMPING OFF TO,

00:43.344 --> 00:44.745
YOU LITTLE PIECE OF BACON?

00:44.778 --> 00:47.348
I AIN'T READY TO TAKE YOU
OUT OF THE PAN.

00:47.381 --> 00:48.316
[sniffs]

00:48.349 --> 00:51.219
AH, SMELLS NICE.
ALL RIGHT.

00:51.252 --> 00:52.520
BE SAD IF SHE DIED

00:52.553 --> 00:54.755
SMELLIN' SO PURTY,
WOULDN'T IT?

00:54.788 --> 00:56.224
HE KNOWS THIS IS A GAME,
RIGHT?

00:56.257 --> 00:58.626
EVERYBODY, SHUT UP.

00:58.659 --> 01:03.297
I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE

OF OBAMA'S AMERICA.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.102
(Mindy)
WHAT CHARACTER IS THIS?

01:08.136 --> 01:09.803
I NEED TO THINK.
EVERYBODY BE QUIET.

01:09.837 --> 01:10.938
(both)
PUT THE GUN DOWN.

01:10.971 --> 01:14.142
LET HIM KILL HIMSELF,
SO I CAN GO HOME AND WATCH TV.

01:14.175 --> 01:15.343
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY, OKAY,
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

01:15.376 --> 01:17.345
[fires gun]

01:17.378 --> 01:18.346
THAT SEEMS UNFAIR.

01:18.379 --> 01:19.680
OKAY, WELL,
THIS WAS A DUMB--

01:19.713 --> 01:22.216
HUGELY DUMB
WASTE OF TIME, PETER.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.285
OW! MY BOOB!

01:24.318 --> 01:25.286
OW!

01:25.319 --> 01:26.887
YOU SHOT
BOTH MY BOOBS.

01:26.920 --> 01:27.888
WELL, ONCE I SHOT
THE BIG ONE,

01:27.921 --> 01:29.390
I HAD TO GET
THE SMALL ONE TOO.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.559
HOW DARE YOU?
THEY'RE BOTH HUGE.

01:31.592 --> 01:32.660
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU'RE FREAKING OUT.

01:32.693 --> 01:34.295
IT'S WINGS AND STINGS.

01:34.328 --> 01:35.696
WINGS.

01:35.729 --> 01:36.730
AND STINGS!

01:36.764 --> 01:38.399
OW!
WHOA!

01:38.432 --> 01:40.234
I HATE THIS.
I HATE WORKING HERE!

01:40.268 --> 01:41.602
YOU WERE HIDING THERE
THE WHOLE TIME?

01:41.635 --> 01:43.070
FOR AN HOUR.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.273
(Danny)
THAT WAS A GOOD SPOT,
THAT WAS A GOOD SPOT.

01:45.306 --> 01:48.276
[upbeat hip-hop music]

01:48.309 --> 01:51.279
[woman vocalizing]

01:51.312 --> 01:57.318
*

02:01.889 --> 02:04.525
WELL, I GATHERED YOU ALL HERE
BECAUSE I HAVE AN IDEA

02:04.558 --> 02:06.527
THAT I BELIEVE WILL
REVOLUTIONIZE THIS WORKPLACE.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.329
WE'RE NOT GETTING
A FRO-YO MACHINE.

02:08.362 --> 02:09.463
YOU'LL NEVER
CHANGE THE FILTER.

02:09.497 --> 02:11.399
WE'LL ALL GET
LEGIONNAIRES' DISEASE.

02:11.432 --> 02:12.266
IT'S NOT THAT, DANNY.

02:12.300 --> 02:13.867
WE HAVE THIS BEAUTIFUL
OUTDOOR SPACE

02:13.901 --> 02:15.669
THAT WE DON'T USE AT ALL,
EXCEPT DANNY

02:15.703 --> 02:16.870
COMES OUT HERE TO SMOKE,
IN SECRET.

02:16.904 --> 02:19.373
OKAY.
SO I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU--

02:19.407 --> 02:22.810
MINDY LAHIRI PRESENTS:
THE SHULMAN AND ASSOCIATES

02:22.843 --> 02:24.612
GAZEBO GARDEN
AND SERENITY SPACE.

02:24.645 --> 02:25.946
AH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
THANK YOU.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.582
I DON'T GET WHY
WE WANT A GIANT SPIDER.

02:28.616 --> 02:29.950
GET OF HERE,
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.486
COOL.
AN IDEA THAT NO ONE LIKES.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.555
YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD DO?
PUT A GRILL OUT HERE.

02:34.588 --> 02:35.823
THAT WAY, WE COULD
COOK UP SOME STEAKS

02:35.856 --> 02:37.291
AND SOME RIBS
FOR THE PATIENTS

02:37.325 --> 02:38.158
WHILE THEY WAIT
FOR THEIR PAPS.

02:38.192 --> 02:39.627
(Morgan)
I LIKE HIS IDEA BETTER,
I DO.

02:39.660 --> 02:40.728
I'M SO SORRY.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.396
OH, NO, NO,
WE'RE NOT BRAINSTORMING.

02:42.430 --> 02:43.664
I'M NOT TAKING SUGGESTIONS.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.333
THIS ALREADY WENT DOWN,
SORRY.

02:45.366 --> 02:46.400
I REALLY LIKE PETER'S IDEA.

02:46.434 --> 02:48.369
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, WHY DO WE
WE NEED A GAZEBO, RIGHT?

02:48.402 --> 02:50.204
IT'S USELESS.
DANNY, FOR ONE,

02:50.238 --> 02:51.539
YOU CAN COME HERE
AND WAIT OUT A RAINSTORM

02:51.572 --> 02:53.741
WITH YOUR ONE TRUE LOVE
OR, LIKE,

02:53.774 --> 02:56.610
GO DANCING IN THE MOONLIGHT,
OR YOU CAN SMOKE,

02:56.644 --> 02:57.978
YOU NICOTINE ADDICT.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.647
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
WE SHOULD DO?

02:59.680 --> 03:01.649
WE SHOULD COVER
THIS FLOWER BED WITH CEMENT

03:01.682 --> 03:03.617
AND ASPHALT AND PUT UP
A BASKETBALL HOOP.

03:03.651 --> 03:04.985
OHH!
OKAY, RIGHT THERE.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.320
THAT'S GENIUS,
RIGHT THERE.

03:06.354 --> 03:08.256
AND NOBODY GETS
LEGIONNAIRES' DISEASE.

03:08.289 --> 03:09.623
WE'RE GETTING A GAZEBO,
DAMN IT.

03:09.657 --> 03:12.660
AND MAYBE A MAYPOLE
IN THE SPRING FOR DANCING.

03:12.693 --> 03:15.529
MORGAN, PLEASE CLEAR THIS TRASH,
SO I CAN STORM OUT.

03:15.563 --> 03:17.265
GET OUT OF THE WAY!

03:17.298 --> 03:19.333
YOU'RE DOING NOTHING,
YOU'RE DOING NOTHING.

03:19.367 --> 03:21.369
NO, NO, IT--

03:21.402 --> 03:25.773
[laughter]

03:25.806 --> 03:27.241
AAH!

03:27.275 --> 03:29.543
(Peter)
CAN YOU TELL THE DIFFERENCE?

03:29.577 --> 03:30.544
LET ME SEE
IF I CAN TAKE--

03:30.578 --> 03:32.380
AAH, AAH!
TAP OUT, TAP OUT!

03:32.413 --> 03:33.414
OH, OH, OOH.

03:33.447 --> 03:34.582
WHAT THE HELL,
YOU GUYS?

03:34.615 --> 03:35.816
I GOTTA SAY, DUDE,
THAT WAS A LOT LONGER

03:35.849 --> 03:37.017
THAN I THOUGHT
YOU WERE GONNA LAST.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.419
THAT WAS AMAZING.

03:38.452 --> 03:39.787
WHAT WAS THAT?
(both)
ULTIMATE FIGHTING.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.855
IT'S LIKE BOXING,
PLUS WRESTLING,

03:41.889 --> 03:43.291
PLUS STRANGLING.

03:43.324 --> 03:44.358
WELL, TELL IT
TO MY GRANOLA BAR,

03:44.392 --> 03:46.327
WHICH FELL ON THE GROUND
AND IS NOW COVERED IN DIRT.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.462
YOU'RE STILL
GONNA EAT THAT.
YEAH, MAYBE I WILL.

03:48.496 --> 03:50.364
THIS GUY'S ACTUALLY FIGHTING
IN AN AMATEUR NIGHT.

03:50.398 --> 03:51.699
IT'S PRETTY BADASS.
I DON'T CARE.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.367
WHY CAN I NOT EAT MY SNACK,
OR DO YOU WANNA RUIN IT,

03:53.401 --> 03:54.668
LIKE MY GAZEBO PLAN?

03:54.702 --> 03:56.370
THERE'S NO PLACE SAFE
FOR A YOUNG HOT WOMAN

03:56.404 --> 03:58.506
TO JUST WALK AROUND,
WATCHING HER INTERNET VIDEOS.

03:58.539 --> 03:59.873
IS THERE A YOUNG
HOT WOMAN AROUND?

03:59.907 --> 04:02.343
WHOA, THOSE ARE FIGHTING WORDS.
FIGHT HIM.

04:02.376 --> 04:03.611
FIGHT HIM RIGHT NOW.
FIGHT HIM RIGHT NOW.

04:03.644 --> 04:05.313
COME ON, LET'S FIGHT.
LET'S WRESTLE.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

04:05.346 --> 04:06.480
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
MAN.

04:08.482 --> 04:10.684
POOR DR. L--
ALL SHE WAS TRYING TO DO

04:10.718 --> 04:12.686
WAS MAKE A GAZEBO WHERE A GIRL
COULD HAVE TEA

04:12.720 --> 04:15.356
WITH HER IMAGINAR--
REAL FRIENDS.

04:15.389 --> 04:17.325
YEAH, GUYS ARE THE WORST.

04:17.358 --> 04:18.692
DID YOU KNOW TODAY
IS ME AND RAY RON'S

04:18.726 --> 04:20.027
20-YEAR ANNIVERSARY?

04:20.060 --> 04:21.295
DO YOU THINK HE REMEMBERED?

04:21.329 --> 04:25.366
AH, GOD, RAY RON
IS A REAL SCRUB.

04:25.399 --> 04:26.700
CAN I SAY THAT WORD?
YEAH.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.536
(Morgan)
YES.
HE IS A SCRUB.

04:28.569 --> 04:30.304
WOULD IT HAVE KILLED HIM
TO TAKE ME

04:30.338 --> 04:33.006
TO A RESTAURANT TONIGHT
AND BUY ME A NEW CAR?
NO.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.643
WE HAD A CAR, BUT RAY RON CAN'T
REMEMBER WHERE HE PARKED IT.

04:35.676 --> 04:37.745
SOMETIMES I WONDER
WHY I'M WITH HIM.

04:37.778 --> 04:38.846
YOU KNOW,
SINCE YOU'RE FREE,

04:38.879 --> 04:40.648
MAYBE WE COULD
KINDA STAY LATE

04:40.681 --> 04:43.484
AND CLEAN UP THE COURTYARD,
SURPRISE DR. L?

04:43.517 --> 04:44.652
MORGAN,
THAT IS A GREAT IDEA.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.086
I THINK
IT'S A TWO-PERSON JOB,

04:46.119 --> 04:48.021
AND WE MIGHT BE HERE
KIND OF LATE.

04:48.055 --> 04:49.457
WHAT DO YOU SAY, TAMRA,
SHOULD WE DO IT?

04:49.490 --> 04:50.458
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M GOING

04:50.491 --> 04:51.759
ON A ROMANTIC DINNER
OR ANYTHING.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.627
YES!

04:53.661 --> 04:56.530
I'M JUST EXCITED 'CAUSE
I THINK DR. L IS AMAZING.

04:56.564 --> 04:57.831
SHE'S OKAY.

05:00.701 --> 05:02.370
HEY.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.438
HOW COME PETER
DOESN'T LIKE ME?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

05:04.472 --> 05:06.073
HE'S ALWAYS UNDERMINING ME
AND BEING A JERK.

05:06.106 --> 05:08.609
BE HONEST. IS IT BECAUSE
I WALK TOO LOUDLY?

05:08.642 --> 05:10.411
MY FEET HAVE
VERY HARD SOLES.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.745
HE LIKES YOU.
HE'S JUST STRESSED OUT.

05:11.779 --> 05:13.414
STRESSED OUT ABOUT WHAT?

05:13.447 --> 05:14.782
PEOPLE FINDING OUT HE'S FRIENDS
WITH JORAN VAN DER SLOOT--

05:14.815 --> 05:16.417
I THINK.
OKAY, TAKE IT EASY.

05:16.450 --> 05:17.685
HE BROKE UP
WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND.

05:17.718 --> 05:18.719
BECCA?
YEAH.

05:18.752 --> 05:19.953
THEY BROKE UP, LIKE,
A YEAR AGO.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.689
OH, I FOLLOW ALL OF YOUR EXES
ON FACEBOOK.

05:21.722 --> 05:22.823
YOU DO?
YEAH.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.024
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO GET ALONG
WITH EVERYONE YOU WORK WITH?

05:24.057 --> 05:26.093
WE DIDN'T GET ALONG WHEN WE
FIRST STARTED WORKING TOGETHER.

05:26.126 --> 05:28.061
YEAH, AND I HATED THAT.
ISN'T IT SO MUCH BETTER NOW?

05:28.095 --> 05:29.730
LOOK, PETER JUST
DOESN'T KNOW YOU.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.432
WHEN I FIRST MET YOU,
I THOUGHT YOU WERE ANNOYING.

05:31.465 --> 05:33.000
AND THEN I GOT
TO KNOW YOU BETTER,

05:33.033 --> 05:34.034
AND I STILL DIDN'T LIKE YOU, AND
NOW I THINK YOU'RE A NICE LADY.

05:34.067 --> 05:36.136
WE'RE FRIENDS. MAYBE YOU
SHOULD TAKE HIM TO LUNCH.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.605
DO YOU THINK THAT'LL HELP?
SURE.

05:37.638 --> 05:39.640
WITH YOUR MOUTH FULL,
YOU CAN'T TALK THAT MUCH.

05:39.673 --> 05:40.908
OKAY.
WHAT? STOP. GET--

05:40.941 --> 05:42.410
I HEARD YOU.
I GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY

05:42.443 --> 05:43.310
TO TAKE IT BACK.
ALL RIGHT, STOP, STOP.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.778
JUST HAVE FUN.
THANK YOU FOR THE ADVICE.

05:44.812 --> 05:47.415
HAVE FUN.

05:49.483 --> 05:52.085
HMM. WHY ARE WE HERE?

05:52.119 --> 05:53.654
SINCE YOU STARTED WORKING HERE,
I FEEL LIKE WE HAVEN'T

05:53.687 --> 05:55.122
HAD A CHANCE TO REALLY
GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

05:55.155 --> 05:57.157
AND YOU THOUGHT THE BEST WAY
TO GET TO KNOW ME

05:57.190 --> 05:59.527
WAS TO TAKE ME
TO THE USA GIRL CAFE?

05:59.560 --> 06:01.495
ACTUALLY, I HAVE
KIND OF A COOL STORY.

06:01.529 --> 06:03.931
WHEN I FIRST GOT MY PERIOD
AT AGE 14,

06:03.964 --> 06:06.066
MY MOM DROVE US DOWN
FROM CONCORD, MASSACHUSETTS,

06:06.099 --> 06:07.067
TO COME HERE.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.169
ALSO, BEST CHICKEN TENDERS
IN TOWN.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.672
I'M GONNA GET OUT OF HERE.
NO. NO, NO, NO, WAIT.

06:11.705 --> 06:12.740
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM
WITH ME?

06:12.773 --> 06:14.408
I DON'T HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH YOU.

06:14.442 --> 06:15.643
I JUST DON'T WANNA HANG OUT
WITH YOU IF I DON'T HAVE TO.

06:15.676 --> 06:17.077
BUT WHY DON'T YOU
WANNA HANG OUT WITH ME?

06:17.110 --> 06:20.948
YOU'RE A LITTLE
SELF-INVOLVED.
WHAT?

06:20.981 --> 06:22.783
IF YOU REALLY WANTED
TO GET TO KNOW ME AT ALL,

06:22.816 --> 06:24.418
WHY WOULDN'T YOU HAVE
TAKEN ME TO A PLACE

06:24.452 --> 06:25.986
THAT WE BOTH
COULD'VE ENJOYED?

06:26.019 --> 06:27.988
I CAN'T EVEN HOLD THE TEACU--

06:28.021 --> 06:32.593
THE HOLES ON THE TEACUPS
DON'T FIT MY FAT FINGERS.

06:32.626 --> 06:33.961
I'M SORRY.
THIS WAS A MISCALCULATION.

06:33.994 --> 06:34.995
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE?

06:35.028 --> 06:36.129
THE PLACE THAT
I TAKE YOU NEXT--

06:36.163 --> 06:38.098
TIARA'S CHAMPAGNE PALACE.

06:38.131 --> 06:40.634
IT IS THE DEATH PLACE
OF LIBERACE'S PLASTIC SURGEON.

06:40.668 --> 06:41.802
YOU SEE,
THIS IS THE THING.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.671
YOU ONLY WANNA DO THINGS
THAT YOU WANNA DO.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.138
AND ALL THE OTHER GUYS
IN THE OFFICE

06:45.172 --> 06:46.306
WOULD GO ALONG WITH IT,
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T

06:46.339 --> 06:48.976
HAVE A GUY LIKE ME TO MAKE
COOL ARRANGEMENTS FOR THEM.

06:49.009 --> 06:52.079
NOW THEY DO, AND IT'S CLEARLY
DRIVING YOU CRAZY.

06:52.112 --> 06:55.483
SO I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

06:55.516 --> 06:56.784
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
I CAN DO COOL BRO THINGS TOO.

06:56.817 --> 06:57.785
NO, SEE YA.

06:57.818 --> 07:00.521
I'M NOT AS GIRLY
AS YOU THINK.

07:05.158 --> 07:06.059
HEY, GREAT IDEA, DANNY.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.561
I TOOK PETER
TO MY FAVORITE LUNCH PLACE,

07:07.595 --> 07:08.696
AND IT WAS A DISASTER.
OH, NO.

07:08.729 --> 07:09.797
DID YOU TAKE HIM
TO THE DOLL PLACE

07:09.830 --> 07:11.164
WHERE YOU
TELL THE PERIOD STORY?

07:11.198 --> 07:13.133
YEAH, AND HE HATED IT.
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

07:13.166 --> 07:14.167
NO.

07:14.201 --> 07:15.636
SO I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN

07:15.669 --> 07:17.705
THE FORMAL PAPERWORK
FOR HIS TERMINATION.

07:17.738 --> 07:18.506
LOOK, YOU NEED
TO TAKE AN INTEREST

07:18.539 --> 07:20.574
IN SOMETHING
THAT PETER CARES ABOUT.

07:20.608 --> 07:22.676
FOR THE LAST TIME,
I WILL NOT LISTEN TO PHISH.

07:22.710 --> 07:24.211
SONGS SHOULD BE
THREE MINUTES LONG,

07:24.244 --> 07:25.813
AND NICKI MINAJ
RAPS IN THE MIDDLE.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.681
LOOK, TONIGHT WE'RE GOING
TO THIS ULTIMATE FIGHTING THING.

07:27.715 --> 07:28.782
YOU SHOULD COME.
ULTIMATE FIGHTING?

07:28.816 --> 07:29.850
YES.
I'M SORRY.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.118
I WOULD RATHER
DEAL WITH A MOUSE

07:31.151 --> 07:32.486
THAT'S TRAPPED IN MY MICROWAVE
THAN GO TO THAT.

07:32.520 --> 07:33.554
SEE, THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.556
YOU GOTTA MAKE AN EFFORT.
PETER WILL APPRECIATE IT.

07:35.589 --> 07:36.724
I'M SUPPOSED TO HAVE DINNER
WITH JASON TONIGHT.

07:36.757 --> 07:38.826
JUST STOP BY.
OKAY, I'LL GO.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.494
GOOD, GO.

07:40.528 --> 07:42.596
I GOT YOU
A FRIENDSHIP CAKE.

07:42.630 --> 07:44.565
THANK YOU.

07:44.598 --> 07:47.034
ONE, TWO, THREE.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.869
(both)
YES!

07:48.902 --> 07:50.037
WHOO!

07:50.070 --> 07:51.639
MAN, DR. L WAS RIGHT.

07:51.672 --> 07:54.608
IT'S, UH, PRETTY ROMANTIC
UP HERE.

07:54.642 --> 07:57.077
YEAH, DR. L'S
GONNA FREAK OUT.

07:57.110 --> 07:59.547
HEY, I COULD NOT HAVE DONE THIS
WITHOUT YOU, BY THE WAY.

07:59.580 --> 08:00.948
I COULD'VE.
IT WOULD'VE PROBABLY

08:00.981 --> 08:04.017
BEEN A LITTLE QUICKER,
BUT I HAD FUN, SO--

08:04.051 --> 08:05.118
THIS WAS BETTER THAN
ANY ANNIVERSARY

08:05.152 --> 08:06.687
RAY RON'S EVER PLANNED.

08:06.720 --> 08:07.454
LAST YEAR,
I JUST WATCHED HIM

08:07.487 --> 08:09.657
WORK HIS SHIFT
AT THE AIRPORT.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.191
DO YOU WANNA GO WITH ME
RIGHT NOW

08:11.224 --> 08:12.593
AND GET CHINESE FOOD?

08:12.626 --> 08:14.094
'CAUSE I KNOW THIS RESTAURANT,
THEY HAVE

08:14.127 --> 08:15.996
SUCH HUGE PORTIONS
THAT PEOPLE WALK

08:16.029 --> 08:17.297
OUT OF THE RESTAURANT,
THEY JUST

08:17.330 --> 08:18.766
GIVE YOU THEIR LEFTOVERS.
THEY CAN'T FINISH 'EM.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.167
SO THEY THINK
YOU'RE HOMELESS?

08:20.200 --> 08:23.671
NO, YOU GET THE L--
OH.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.005
YEAH. I'M STILL
WITH RAY RON.

08:25.038 --> 08:27.608
MAYBE ANOTHER TIME.
YEAH. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

08:27.641 --> 08:29.242
WE'LL DO IT SOME OTHER TIME.
ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU.

08:29.276 --> 08:32.279
I'LL SEE YOU AT THE OFFICE,
LATER ON.

08:34.014 --> 08:34.982
[line rings]

08:35.015 --> 08:36.249
HEY, WHERE ARE YOU?

08:36.283 --> 08:38.619
I AM ALREADY ON MY THIRD BOWL
OF EDAMAME.

08:38.652 --> 08:41.188
I AM GOING TO BE
30 MINUTES LATE--

08:41.221 --> 08:43.791
45, AN HOUR TOPS.

08:43.824 --> 08:46.159
OKAY, THAT'S SOMETHING
YOU TELL ME EARLY IN THE DAY,

08:46.193 --> 08:48.028
NOT WHEN YOU'RE ALREADY
15 MINUTES LATE.

08:48.061 --> 08:50.664
THE SUSHI CHEF AND I
ARE REALLY RUNNING OUT

08:50.698 --> 08:52.132
OF THINGS TO TALK ABOUT.

08:52.165 --> 08:53.634
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
BREAKING BAD?

08:53.667 --> 08:54.668
(Jason)
I LED WITH BREAKING BAD.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.737
I SAID WALTER WHITE
WAS AN ANTIHERO,

08:56.770 --> 08:58.071
AND HE ROLLED HIS EYES.

08:58.105 --> 09:01.241
OKAY, I'M SO SORRY.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:01.274 --> 09:02.743
WHY DON'T YOU
COME OVER TONIGHT,

09:02.776 --> 09:04.745
AND I PROMISE
I WILL DO THAT THING

09:04.778 --> 09:06.013
THAT I TOLD YOU
I WOULDN'T DO.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.648
I WAS GONNA DO IT ANYWAY.

09:07.681 --> 09:08.849
REALLY?

09:08.882 --> 09:11.752
THAT'S INTERESTING.

09:11.785 --> 09:12.552
OH, AND IF YOU'RE
AT THAT PLACE,

09:12.586 --> 09:14.021
YOU SHOULD GET
THE PHILADELPHIA ROLL.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.689
DANNY SAYS IT'S AMAZING.
IT'S HIS FAVORITE.

09:15.723 --> 09:17.124
(Jason)
UH, DULY NOTED.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.859
(Mindy)
OH, I HAVE TO HANG UP.
DANNY'S TEXTING ME.

09:18.892 --> 09:24.632
[phone chimes]

09:24.665 --> 09:25.633
(Eminem)
* IT'S ABOUT TO KICK OFF

09:25.666 --> 09:26.967
* THIS PARTY LOOKS WACK

09:27.000 --> 09:28.268
* LET'S TAKE IT BACK
TO STRAIGHT HIP-HOP *

09:28.301 --> 09:29.737
* AND START IT
FROM SCRATCH *

09:29.770 --> 09:30.838
* I'M 'BOUT TO BLOODY
THIS TRACK UP *

09:30.871 --> 09:31.872
* EVERYBODY GET BACK

09:31.905 --> 09:38.178
[crowd cheering]

09:38.211 --> 09:39.880
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.649
TAKE HIM DOWN, TAKE HIM DOWN!
OH!

09:41.682 --> 09:43.283
HEY, GUYS,
SORRY I WAS LATE.

09:43.316 --> 09:44.652
I WAS DISTRACTED,
TALKING TO A MAN

09:44.685 --> 09:46.186
WHO ACTUALLY HAD
A PIERCED EYEBALL.

09:46.219 --> 09:47.320
OOH.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:47.354 --> 09:48.756
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

09:48.789 --> 09:49.923
WE ARE HERE
TO SUPPORT PETER.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.224
HE'S BEEN TRAINING IN MMA.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.760
TONIGHT IS HIS FIRST BOUT.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.662
WAIT. I'M SORRY.
YOU'RE GOING IN THERE?

09:54.695 --> 09:56.129
NO, NO, NO, NO.
THAT'S NOT SAFE.

09:56.163 --> 09:58.632
NO WAY, MAN.
HE'S GONNA GROUND AND POUND.

09:58.666 --> 10:00.100
PETER, WHY WOULD YOU
DO THIS?

10:00.133 --> 10:01.702
I GUESS IT GOES BACK
TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

10:01.735 --> 10:03.303
AND ALL THE BULLYING.
OH, I SEE.

10:03.336 --> 10:05.639
YOU WERE BULLIED,
AND MARTIAL ARTS

10:05.673 --> 10:06.674
IS THE WAY THAT
YOU STOOD UP FOR YOURSELF.

10:06.707 --> 10:09.009
THAT MAKES SENSE.
WHAT? NO.
I WAS THE BULLY.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.678
WHAT I WAS SAYING WAS
MAYBE IF THOSE KIDS

10:10.711 --> 10:11.812
WERE MORE INTO MMA,
I WOULD'VE

10:11.845 --> 10:13.681
THOUGHT THEY WERE COOL
AND LEFT THEM ALONE.

10:13.714 --> 10:14.682
[crowd roars]

10:14.715 --> 10:17.084
YOU KNOW, IT LOOKS
KIND OF HOMOEROTIC TO ME.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.119
WHAT?
THERE'S NOTHING HOMOEROTIC

10:19.152 --> 10:20.654
ABOUT GRAPPLING
WITH ANOTHER MAN,

10:20.688 --> 10:21.755
PINNING HIM TO THE GROUND,

10:21.789 --> 10:23.390
AND MAKING HIM
SUCCUMB TO YOUR WILL.

10:23.423 --> 10:25.158
NO, I'M NOT DISSING IT.
I LIKE IT.

10:25.192 --> 10:27.260
(Mindy)
THAT'S RIGHT,
TEAR HIM APART!

10:27.294 --> 10:28.261
YOU HAVE GREAT CHEMISTRY!

10:28.295 --> 10:30.430
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT?
NO, DON'T DO THAT.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.732
YOU'RE GONNA
GET US KILLED.

10:31.765 --> 10:35.669
THIS RING CHICK IS SO HOT.

10:35.703 --> 10:38.338
OH, MY GOD.

10:38.371 --> 10:41.008
WE CAN'T FIRE BEVERLY
AND HIRE THIS GIRL, RIGHT?

10:41.041 --> 10:43.376
HEY, GUYS, I'M SORRY,
THEY ONLY HAD BEER.

10:43.410 --> 10:44.277
I ASKED FOR MOJITOS,

10:44.311 --> 10:46.446
THEY DIDN'T HAVE
THE MUDDLING EQUIPMENT.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.015
WHAT A SHOCK. THEY DIDN'T
HAVE MUDDLING EQUIPMENT

10:48.048 --> 10:50.383
AT AN AMATEUR MMA FIGHT?

10:50.417 --> 10:52.753
(Jeremy)
THAT'S A WOMAN.
(Danny)
VERY HOT.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.822
OH, MY GOD.
I KNOW HER.

10:54.855 --> 10:57.157
MARIE, HI!

10:57.190 --> 10:58.158
DR. LAHIRI?

10:58.191 --> 10:59.359
HOW'S IT GOING?

10:59.392 --> 11:01.228
SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

11:01.261 --> 11:02.863
THIS IS GOOD.
MINDY'S OUR IN.

11:02.896 --> 11:04.397
HOW ARE YOUR EPISIOTOMY STITCHES
HEALING?

11:04.431 --> 11:06.466
WHY WOULD YOU START
A CONVERSATION THAT WAY?

11:06.499 --> 11:08.869
OH, MY GOD.
MY OLDEST JUST GAVE BIRTH TOO.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.704
(Marie)
I'M A GRANDMOTHER.
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

11:10.738 --> 11:13.006
(Mindy)
GRANNY IN THE HOUSE.
CONGRATULATIONS.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.108
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE THE BATHROOM IS?

11:15.142 --> 11:17.177
OH, HOLD ON. NO, NO, NO.
I GOT YOU, I GOT YOU.

11:17.210 --> 11:18.345

BRICKS IN HERE?

11:23.083 --> 11:25.285
OH, MY GOD, DUDE.
SORRY, SORRY.

11:25.318 --> 11:26.854
SIR, SIR, SIR.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.421
MORGAN TOOKERS.

11:28.455 --> 11:30.157
I'M SUCH A BIG FAN

11:30.190 --> 11:32.192
I USED TO WATCH
DEAL OR NO DEAL,

11:32.225 --> 11:33.326
AND I WOULD PLAY ALONG
AT HOME.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.062
I LOVE YOUR STAND-UP COMEDY.

11:35.095 --> 11:36.764

11:44.872 --> 11:46.473
THE GLORY IN THE QUARRY.

11:46.506 --> 11:48.141
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THAT IS,

11:48.175 --> 11:49.409
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU ARE.

11:49.442 --> 11:50.443
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

11:50.477 --> 11:51.845
YOU'RE TRYING
TO PLAY IT COOL,

11:51.879 --> 11:53.180
SO YOU CAN, LIKE,
NEGOTIATE

11:53.213 --> 11:54.782
A CHEAPER CONTRACT FOR ME.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.149
THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK,

11:56.183 --> 11:57.417
BECAUSE I DO IT FOR FREE.

11:57.450 --> 11:59.419
ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

11:59.452 --> 12:00.921
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

12:00.954 --> 12:02.055
THANK YOU, MR. WHITE!

12:02.089 --> 12:03.991
WE'LL FIGURE OUT
MY FIGHTER NAME LATER.

12:04.024 --> 12:06.493
EXCUSE ME. I GOT A MESSAGE
FOR MORGAN TOOKERS.

12:06.526 --> 12:08.295
IT'S IN REGARDS TO STRAIGHT-UP
KILLING HIM.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.230

12:10.263 --> 12:13.533
I'M TAMRA'S CLOWNED-ON

WHOA!

12:15.668 --> 12:18.271
THIS IS A JABRONI-FREE ZONE.
OKAY, WATCH YOUR MOUTH.

12:18.305 --> 12:20.473
MY FATHER WAS A JABRONI.
THAT'S CRAZY, 'CAUSE--

12:20.507 --> 12:22.409
[grunting]

12:22.442 --> 12:23.811

12:23.844 --> 12:25.445

12:25.478 --> 12:26.546
OKAY, IT SEEMS LIKE
YOU'RE PROJECTING,

12:26.579 --> 12:28.081
BUT THAT'S GOOD.
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:28.115 --> 12:29.449
YOU'RE A WORTHLESS
PIECE OF TRASH.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.318
OKAY, THAT'S GOOD,
MINDY, THAT'S GOOD.

12:31.351 --> 12:32.853

FROM--

13:02.983 --> 13:04.251
FORGET IT.
DON'T READ IT.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.518
WHEN HE ASKED HER
TO MARRY HIM,

13:05.552 --> 13:07.087
THE CLASS DID IT,
AND THEY--

13:07.120 --> 13:08.555
THEY'RE HOLDING
THE "R"s BACKWARDS.

13:08.588 --> 13:10.057
SORRY, MAN.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.424
THAT GUY LOOKS LIKE A LOSER
WITH HIS BOAT.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.060
AND HE'S, LIKE, 6'4".

13:13.093 --> 13:14.361
YOU'RE BAD AT THIS.

13:14.394 --> 13:17.264
THAT'S GREAT, MINDY.
I'M REALLY GLAD YOU MADE IT.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.099

13:27.807 --> 13:29.910
(Mindy)
OKAY, THAT'S OKAY.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:29.943 --> 13:31.611
THIS IS AN AMATEUR FIGHT,
SO I THINK HE'LL BE FINE.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.232
A DEATH THAT
HASN'T HAPPENED YET.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.534
NO, I DIDN'T DO IT,
BUT I AM RESPONSIBLE.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.105
[both grunting]

14:00.207 --> 14:01.208
OH, NO. OH, GOD.

14:01.241 --> 14:02.342
OH, PETE.
OH, GOD, PETER.

14:02.375 --> 14:03.944
I MADE A MISTAKE,
DOING THIS.

14:03.977 --> 14:06.313
(Mindy)
NO, PETER, PETER, PETER!

14:06.346 --> 14:07.380
OH!
GOD.

14:07.414 --> 14:08.548
WHAT IS HAPPENING?

14:08.581 --> 14:10.017
PETER IS JUST STANDING THERE
AND TAKING IT,

14:10.050 --> 14:11.651
LIKE HE'S THE WIFE
IN A COUNTRY MUSIC MOVIE.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.286
HOW COULD YOU WORK
WITH PETER ALL THESE MONTHS

14:13.320 --> 14:15.255
AND NOT KNOW THAT MENTIONING
BECCA WOULD DESTROY HIM?

14:15.288 --> 14:17.224
IT'S TEXTBOOK LAHIRI.
OKAY.

14:17.257 --> 14:20.660
LET'S FOCUS ON OUR FRIEND.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.629
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, WE HAVE
GOT TO GET HIM OUT OF THERE.

14:22.662 --> 14:23.997
PETE, JUST PLAY DEAD!

14:24.031 --> 14:25.032
I CANNOT WATCH.
OH--

14:25.065 --> 14:27.000
OH, NO, PETE.
NO, PETE.
GET BEATEN UP LESS.

14:27.034 --> 14:28.001
NOBODY SCAMS
ON MY GIRLFRIEND!

14:28.035 --> 14:29.069
I DON'T WANNA FIGHT, DUDE.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.437
I JUST CAME TO GIVE YOU THIS.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.239
WHAT?
OHH!

14:32.272 --> 14:35.142
[both grunting]

14:38.278 --> 14:40.247
PETER, PETER.
OH, NO.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.015
MARIE, MARIE, MARIE.

14:42.049 --> 14:43.250
PLEASE, I NEED
TO GET IN THE RING.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.252
I'M SORRY, THE ONLY PEOPLE
ALLOWED IN THE RING

14:45.285 --> 14:47.587
ARE PEOPLE WILLING TO DIE
OR FLASH THEIR BOOBS.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.189
IF YOU DO ME THIS FAVOR,
THE NEXT TIME

14:49.222 --> 14:49.990
YOU GIVE BIRTH,
I PROMISE YOU

14:50.023 --> 14:51.558
I WILL GET YOU
THE CELEBRITY SUITE.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.994
I DON'T CARE IF I HAVE
TO KICK OUT ICE-T AND COCO.

14:54.027 --> 14:55.328
I'M ONLY NOW REALIZING

14:55.362 --> 14:56.563
THAT BOTH OF THEIR NAMES
ARE DRINKS.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.198
[thud]
AAH!

14:58.231 --> 15:00.167
OH, GOD.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

15:03.536 --> 15:04.972
(Mindy)
IT'S TIME FOR ROUND TWO!

15:05.005 --> 15:06.439
TAKE YOUR TOP OFF!

15:06.473 --> 15:08.141
EXCUSE ME, SIR,
I'M JUST HERE

15:08.175 --> 15:10.677
TO CONVEY NUMERICAL INFORMATION
ABOUT WHICH ROUND IT IS.

15:10.710 --> 15:11.878
OH, GOD, MINDY.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.481
HEY, LOOK AT ME!
(Danny)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:14.514 --> 15:16.149
ALL RIGHT, GET DOWN.
YOU'RE GONNA GET HURT.

15:16.183 --> 15:17.217
I THINK PEOPLE LIKE IT.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.051
NO, THEY'RE NOT
RESPONDING TO IT.

15:18.085 --> 15:19.252
THEY HATE IT.
THEY HATE IT, OKAY.

15:19.286 --> 15:20.487
THAT IS 50%
OF THE SURGEONS

15:20.520 --> 15:21.989
IN OUR PRACTICE.

15:22.022 --> 15:23.156
HEY, HEY, HEY,
LISTEN TO ME.

15:23.190 --> 15:24.958
YOU NEED TO QUIT.
I CAN'T QUIT.

15:24.992 --> 15:25.892
I'LL LOOK LIKE A WUSS.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.727
THAT IS BETTER
THAN BEING DEAD OR PARALYZED.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.229
NO, IT'S NOT.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.697
NOT FOR A DUDE IT'S NOT.

15:30.730 --> 15:32.032
I MEAN, IT IS,
IT'S WAY BETTER,

15:32.065 --> 15:34.167
BUT NOT FOR A DUDE.
HEY, HEY, PETER.

15:34.201 --> 15:36.336
THAT GUY LOOKS LIKE HE GUARDS
THE GATES TO HELL.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.171
HE'S GOING TO KILL YOU.
HE SHOULD.

15:38.205 --> 15:40.073
HE SHOULD PUT ME
OUT OF MY MISERY.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.141
HEY, HEY, HEY,
THIS IS DUMB.

15:41.174 --> 15:43.643
HEY, HEY, LOOK ALIVE,
LOOK ALIVE.

15:43.676 --> 15:45.678
WHY IS EVERYONE HITTING ME
IN THE FACE TODAY?

15:45.712 --> 15:47.547
BECAUSE YOU NEED
TO GET SMACKED, SON.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.216
YOU EITHER NEED TO GET
OUT OF THIS RING AND QUIT,

15:49.249 --> 15:50.517
OR YOU NEED
TO REALLY BUCKLE DOWN.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.385
BUCKLE DOWN?
WHAT, AM I DOING HOMEWORK?

15:52.419 --> 15:54.121
IF YOU'RE GONNA DO THIS,
YOU NEED TO PICTURE

15:54.154 --> 15:55.755
THAT THE OTHER GUY
IS SOMEONE THAT YOU HATE.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.257
THE ONLY WAY
THAT I GET THROUGH SPIN CLASS

15:57.290 --> 15:59.092
IS THAT I PRETEND
THAT I'M RUNNING OVER THE BODY

15:59.126 --> 15:59.993
OF THAT MICHAEL JACKSON DOCTOR--

16:00.027 --> 16:01.694
THE ONE THAT STOLE
MICHAEL JACKSON FROM US.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.263
I HATE THAT GUY!

16:03.296 --> 16:04.531
I HATE YOU,
MICHAEL JACKSON DOCTOR,

16:04.564 --> 16:06.466
FOR TAKING AWAY MICHAEL!
JUST DO THAT WITH HIM.

16:06.499 --> 16:08.268
OKAY, PETER?
PETER, LOOK AT ME.

16:08.301 --> 16:09.636
PETER, I BELIEVE IN YOU.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.104
YOU CAN DO THIS.

16:11.138 --> 16:13.040
HERE'S SOMEONE I HATE.
YES!

16:13.073 --> 16:15.075
I HATE BECCA'S FIANCE.
GREAT, THAT'S PERFECT.

16:15.108 --> 16:16.709
HE'S A KINDERGARTEN TEACHER.
YES.

16:16.743 --> 16:17.910
WHO TEACHES KINDERGARTEN?

16:17.944 --> 16:20.713
AND HE DOES IT
IN THE INNER CITY, NO LESS.
THAT'S NICE.

16:20.747 --> 16:22.149
(Peter)
LET'S GO, BEARD-O!

16:22.182 --> 16:24.251
[bell rings]
OKAY, GOOD.

16:24.284 --> 16:25.352
HAD ENOUGH?

16:25.385 --> 16:28.655
YEAH, I PUT MY TRASH
IN THE TRASH.

16:28.688 --> 16:33.060
[crying]

16:33.093 --> 16:35.662
DON'T--DON'T CRY, PLEASE.
DON'T--
[sniffles]

16:35.695 --> 16:36.763
COME ON, MAN.

16:36.796 --> 16:38.198
COME ON,
GET OUT OF THERE.

16:38.231 --> 16:40.467
YEAH. OH, GOD.
GET OUT OF THERE.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.435
[crying]

16:42.469 --> 16:44.171
I-I JUST DON'T WANNA
LOSE TAMRA.

16:44.204 --> 16:46.106
SHE'S THE BEST THING I GOT.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.707
AND I OWN
A WATER BED, MAN.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.276
YEAH, WELL, MAYBE
YOU DESERVE TO LOSE HER.

16:49.309 --> 16:51.111
WHAT WAS YESTERDAY?

16:51.144 --> 16:53.380
IT WAS YOUR ANNIVERSARY.
OH, DAMN.

16:53.413 --> 16:55.048
I THOUGHT
IT WAS LAST MONTH,

16:55.082 --> 16:57.217
AND I WAS IN THE CLEAR.
YEAH, WELL, IT'S NOT.

16:57.250 --> 17:01.621
[sighs]
OKAY, LOOK.

17:01.654 --> 17:04.591
I'M ONLY DOING THIS
BECAUSE TAMRA CARES ABOUT YOU.

17:04.624 --> 17:05.825
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE
A GIRLFRIEND, MAN,

17:05.858 --> 17:07.294
YOU GOTTA BE
ALL ABOUT HER.

17:07.327 --> 17:10.230
YOU GOTTA BE
UP IN HER GRILL 24/7.

17:10.263 --> 17:11.698
YOU HAVE TO SMOTHER THEM
WITH LOVE.

17:11.731 --> 17:14.701
I MEAN, THAT'S WHY
NONE OF MINE WORK OUT.

17:14.734 --> 17:16.203
[sighs]
I DON'T KNOW.

17:16.236 --> 17:19.139
MAYBE THAT'S BAD ADVICE.
NO, THAT'S GOOD ADVICE.

17:19.172 --> 17:20.673
I NEED TO DO SOMETHING BIG.
YEAH.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.675
LIKE, SOMETHING THAT
HAS THE EFFECT OF JEWELRY,

17:22.709 --> 17:24.177
BUT COSTS NO MONEY.

17:24.211 --> 17:27.514
YEAH, THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

17:27.547 --> 17:28.515
THANK YOU, MORGAN.

17:28.548 --> 17:31.184
COME ON.

17:31.218 --> 17:32.652
THAT HAPPENS AGAIN, THOUGH,

17:32.685 --> 17:34.121
I'M GONNA
STEAL YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

17:34.154 --> 17:35.188
[chuckles]

17:35.222 --> 17:37.157
I'M SERIOUS.
WHAT?

17:39.226 --> 17:41.161
THAT'S GOOD, PETER,
THAT'S GOOD.

17:41.194 --> 17:43.163
JUST KEEP AWAY FROM HIM.

17:43.196 --> 17:44.731
GO, PETE!
COME ON, PETER!

17:44.764 --> 17:47.400
OH! UGH.

17:47.434 --> 17:49.536
[all cheering]

17:49.569 --> 17:51.671
AHH!
[laughs]
PETE!

17:51.704 --> 17:53.273
YES, PETER!

17:53.306 --> 17:55.442
WOW. IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR PEP TALK
DID HIM SOME GOOD.

17:55.475 --> 17:56.443
THIS IS WHY I THINK
I SHOULD BE

17:56.476 --> 17:58.345
ONE OF THOSE HIGHLY PAID
MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKERS.

17:58.378 --> 17:59.712
AH, HEY, WHAT'D I MISS?

17:59.746 --> 18:00.747
AAH!

18:04.817 --> 18:05.785
OKAY.
YOU DON'T THINK

18:05.818 --> 18:07.354
THE CROWD SAW ME CRYING,
DO YOU?

18:07.387 --> 18:08.721
NO, THEY DEFINITELY DIDN'T.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.423
BECAUSE MOST OF THE TIME,
YOUR FACE

18:10.457 --> 18:12.225
WAS SMUSHED
INTO THAT GUY'S CROTCH.

18:12.259 --> 18:14.394
OH, THANK GOD.
YEAH.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.765
BECCA REALLY DID A NUMBER
ON YOU, HUH?

18:18.798 --> 18:20.300
I MOSTLY FEEL BAD
FOR HER NEW FIANCE.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.169
HE'S GONNA HAVE TO DEAL
WITH ALL HER ISSUES, YOU KNOW?

18:22.202 --> 18:23.470
ALL THOSE
SUPREME COURT JUSTICES

18:23.503 --> 18:24.737
CALLING THE HOUSE
ALL THE TIME.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.639
"CLERK FOR ME.
CLERK FOR ME."

18:26.673 --> 18:28.775
I KNOW IT'S NOT
THE BRO-IEST OF THINGS,

18:28.808 --> 18:31.211
BUT IF YOU EVER WANNA
GOSSIP ABOUT EXES,

18:31.244 --> 18:32.812
THAT'S LIKE MY MMA.

18:32.845 --> 18:34.514
WAS THAT
A GOOD SPORTS ANALOGY?

18:34.547 --> 18:35.515
NO.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.350
OKAY.
BUT THANK YOU.

18:37.384 --> 18:39.252
I MIGHT TAKE YOU UP
ON THAT.

18:39.286 --> 18:41.421
THE MOST I GET
ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS FROM DANNY

18:41.454 --> 18:42.855
IS LIKE--[Danny impression]
"NOT FOR NOTHING,

18:42.889 --> 18:44.524
BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS."

18:44.557 --> 18:46.793
[laughs]

18:46.826 --> 18:48.828
I'M SORRY.
I WAS WRONG.

18:48.861 --> 18:50.430
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

18:50.463 --> 18:51.698
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

18:51.731 --> 18:52.865
AND TO BE HONEST,
WHEN YOU'RE NOT

18:52.899 --> 18:55.735
AROUND THE OTHER GUYS,
YOU'RE NOT THAT BAD.

18:55.768 --> 18:56.836
THANKS.

18:56.869 --> 18:58.271
WHEN I'M HIGH
ON PAINKILLERS,

18:58.305 --> 18:59.806
YOUR VOICE
ISN'T THAT SHRILL.

18:59.839 --> 19:01.308
OH, ALL RIGHT.
THANKS.

19:01.341 --> 19:03.876
THAT'S VERY NICE
OF YOU, PETER.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.678
[chuckles]

19:05.712 --> 19:08.548
YOU ARE PRETTY HIGH RIGHT NOW,
AREN'T YOU?

19:09.616 --> 19:11.751
HEY!

19:13.920 --> 19:15.588
WHAT A NICE SURPRISE.
HI.

19:15.622 --> 19:17.590
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.

19:17.624 --> 19:19.326
I WAS SUPPOSED TO MEET YOU
BACK AT MY APARTMENT.

19:19.359 --> 19:20.793
LOOK, MINDY,
I THINK YOU'RE GREAT.

19:20.827 --> 19:21.794
AND I THINK YOU ARE GREAT.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.530
AND THAT CAN JUST BE THE END
OF THE CONVERSATION.

19:23.563 --> 19:24.764
YOU DON'T NEED TO CONTINUE
ANY FURTHER.

19:24.797 --> 19:27.267
NO, THIS IS AN
"I THINK YOU'RE GREAT, BUT--"

19:27.300 --> 19:29.902
I AM SO SORRY I FORGOT
ABOUT OUR PLANS.
TWICE.

19:29.936 --> 19:30.903
IT'S JUST, I FELT
THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT

19:30.937 --> 19:32.272
THAT I GO FOR WORK.

19:32.305 --> 19:33.740
HAVEN'T YOU EVER
HAD TO DO SOMETHING

19:33.773 --> 19:35.342
BECAUSE OF WORK?
YEAH, SURE.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.944
I JUST WENT TO MY BOSS' KID'S
MIDDLE SCHOOL GRADUATION,

19:37.977 --> 19:39.312
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I'VE MEMORIZED

19:39.346 --> 19:43.283
HER FAVORITE SUSHI ORDER.

19:43.316 --> 19:44.617
I'M SORRY, MINDY.

19:44.651 --> 19:46.553
I'M GONNA--

19:46.586 --> 19:48.521
GOOD-BYE.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.302
HELLO.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.371
I'D LIKE TO SPEAK
TO YOUR SEXIEST NURSE.

20:04.404 --> 20:06.939
OH. MORGAN?

20:06.973 --> 20:09.242
RAY RON,
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

20:09.276 --> 20:11.544
TAMRA, I'M THE DUMBEST GUY
ON EARTH.

20:11.578 --> 20:13.680
I MEAN, TO THINK I SPENT
OUR ENTIRE ANNIVERSARY

20:13.713 --> 20:15.515
TRYING TO FIND STUFF
IN THE GARAGE

20:15.548 --> 20:16.716
THAT WOULD WORK
AS DRUGS--

20:16.749 --> 20:18.017
YEAH, YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.752
YEAH, BUT I'M ABOUT
TO MAKE IT UP.

20:19.786 --> 20:21.788
'CAUSE I USED THE LIBRARY
COMPUTERS TO FIND OUT

20:21.821 --> 20:25.558
THAT THE RIGHT GIFT
FOR A 20TH ANNIVERSARY IS CHINA.

20:25.592 --> 20:27.360
YOU USED A COMPUTER
FOR ME?

20:27.394 --> 20:28.828
AND WHILE I CAN'T AFFORD
A WHOLE COUNTRY,

20:28.861 --> 20:32.265
I GOT YOU THIS.
AWW!

20:32.299 --> 20:34.601
I'MA CALL YOU "NEW CAR,"

20:34.634 --> 20:36.736
'CAUSE THAT'S
WHAT I REALLY WANTED.

20:36.769 --> 20:39.772
GIRL, I'MA TAKE YOU
TO A MENU RESTAURANT.

20:39.806 --> 20:42.875
MORGAN, CAN YOU
COVER FOR ME?

20:42.909 --> 20:44.544
YES, YES, SURE.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.479
I'LL DO ANYTHING
FOR YOU, TAMRA.

20:46.513 --> 20:48.014
AND THIS TIME,
YOU TIPPIN' THE WAITER, RAY RON.

20:48.047 --> 20:49.282
WAIT. WHAT?

20:49.316 --> 20:50.783
THEY ARE A GREAT COUPLE.

20:50.817 --> 20:54.587
YOU'RE A GREAT COUPLE.
OH, THANK YOU.

20:54.621 --> 20:55.588
(Mindy)
GENTLEMEN, OPEN YOUR EYES.

20:55.622 --> 20:57.424
I WOULD LIKE

20:57.457 --> 20:59.492

PRENTICE

20:59.526 --> 21:00.927
MEMORIAL BASKETBALL PARK.

21:00.960 --> 21:01.961
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GAZEBO?

21:01.994 --> 21:03.863
THERE'S A GAZEBO
IN MY HEART.

21:03.896 --> 21:06.599
MINDY, THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.
SO AMAZING.

21:06.633 --> 21:07.934
TAKE THE FIRST SHOT.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.402
REALLY?
YEAH, OF COURSE.

21:09.436 --> 21:10.737
OKAY, COOL.

21:10.770 --> 21:11.971
THANK YOU, PETER.
THANK YOU.

21:12.004 --> 21:14.374
THIS IS AWESOME.

21:14.407 --> 21:15.942

21:15.975 --> 21:18.745
WHAT THE HELL?
