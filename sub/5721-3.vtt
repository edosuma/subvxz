00:18.580 --> 00:20.741
Howard?
HI.

00:20.800 --> 00:22.222
Uh, love your coasters.

00:22.280 --> 00:23.929
Big fan of Lincoln.

00:23.980 --> 00:25.538
It's George Bernard Shaw.

00:25.590 --> 00:27.979
Big anti-Semite.

00:28.020 --> 00:29.976
What are you doing here, Howard?

00:30.030 --> 00:31.895
[chuckles]
Need a lavwer.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.588
GRACE [laughing]:
Oh, my God, I was such a cow.

00:35.640 --> 00:37.596
Oh, well, don't
worry, dear.

00:37.640 --> 00:39.369
Most babies are
unattractive.

00:39.430 --> 00:41.375
Oh, Jackie.

00:41.430 --> 00:43.125
GRACE: Grandma's helping me
pick out family photos

00:43.170 --> 00:44.649
for Dad's campaign ad.

00:44.690 --> 00:47.079
Oh, you look so stern
in these pictures, Alicia.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.904
GRACE: Uh, there's a Mr. Lyman
in the living room.

00:48.960 --> 00:51.656
He said he knew you.

00:51.700 --> 00:53.429
And Lucca Quinn called.
She said they need you
in bond court in an hour.

00:53.480 --> 00:55.266
Okay, thanks.

00:55.310 --> 00:57.096
Why do you need
a lawyer, Howard?

00:57.140 --> 00:57.913
They're pushing me out.

00:57.970 --> 00:59.221
Cary, that little gerbil,

00:59.270 --> 01:01.056
told me to take
emeritus status.

01:01.100 --> 01:02.829
Can you imagine
that? Me? Huh?

01:02.880 --> 01:04.609
My billings are
up double digits.

01:04.670 --> 01:06.661
Well, not you; your associates.

01:06.710 --> 01:08.439
I'm a partner, I'm adding va...

01:08.500 --> 01:10.456
Whose side are you on, aanay?

01:10.500 --> 01:12.718
My guess is, they're pushing you
out because of performance.

01:12.760 --> 01:14.489
You don't do anything, Howard.

01:16.550 --> 01:19.508
Look”.

01:19.550 --> 01:21.506
you know why I'm here.

01:21.550 --> 01:24.508
You want to get back at
Lockhart/Agos for firing you;

01:24.560 --> 01:27.120
I want to bring an ageism suit.

01:27.170 --> 01:29.126
We can help
each other out.

01:29.170 --> 01:31.900
Howard...

01:31.960 --> 01:33.609
let me give you some advice.

01:33.650 --> 01:35.652
We on the meter?No, this is free.

01:35.700 --> 01:39.522
You can't bring an ageism suit
if you quit.

01:39.570 --> 01:41.526
You have to be fired.

01:41.570 --> 01:43.572
And you can't let them
fire you for cause.

01:43.620 --> 01:46.441
So what do I do?

01:46.490 --> 01:49.448
Work harder.

01:49.500 --> 01:51.183
Bring more money
to the firm,

01:51.240 --> 01:52.969
and they won't have
a rationale to fire you.

01:53.020 --> 01:54.499
Lay the groundwork.

01:54.540 --> 01:57.008
Keep a journal of every incident
of ageism you encounter.

01:57.070 --> 01:58.765
With details--
who said or did what.

01:58.810 --> 02:01.677
And don't give them
cause to fire you.

02:03.900 --> 02:05.151
I have to go to bond court.

02:05.210 --> 02:06.689
[elevator bell dings]

02:15.220 --> 02:16.642
#3:?

02:16.700 --> 02:18.213
Madame.

02:21.750 --> 02:23.695
Did you used to sing?

02:23.750 --> 02:25.001
Excuse me?

02:25.050 --> 02:27.006
Sing.

02:27.050 --> 02:30.053
You look like someone I used to
know at the Civic Opera House.

02:30.100 --> 02:32.091
Uh, no.

02:34.110 --> 02:36.271
You do have the face
of an opera srnger.

02:36.330 --> 02:38.844
[scoffs]

02:38.890 --> 02:41.108
You are a flirt.

02:41.160 --> 02:42.639
My best quality.

02:42.680 --> 02:45.638
[cell phone rings]

02:45.680 --> 02:47.671
Just a second.

02:49.120 --> 02:51.588
Hello. Who is this,
please?

02:51.640 --> 02:53.688
It's Eli. Why are you
talking like that?

02:53.730 --> 02:56.119
Uh, talking like
what, Mr. Gold?

02:56.170 --> 02:57.899
Like you're... Nothing.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.166
Where are you, Jackie?

02:59.220 --> 03:00.437
I need these photos right now.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.300
I'm coming directly, Mr. Gold.

03:02.350 --> 03:03.521
Eli, we started.

03:03.570 --> 03:04.787
Started? It's 10:20.

03:04.830 --> 03:06.047
RUTH:
Yeah.

03:06.090 --> 03:07.739
The meeting was at 10:00.

03:10.660 --> 03:15.529
Yes, oddly I was told
the meeting began at 10:30.

03:15.580 --> 03:16.968
_ RUTH:
HIllary uses Iowa

03:17.020 --> 03:18.442
to shore up her base,
and we use it

03:18.500 --> 03:19.660
to stake out ground
to her right.

03:19.720 --> 03:21.802
Hillary will
run the table,

03:21.850 --> 03:24.580
and we'll be the only
vice presidential option

03:24.630 --> 03:27.064
who can pull in the middle.Which is why
our theme of the week

03:27.110 --> 03:29.192
needs a center-right tilt."Family first."

03:29.250 --> 03:32.208
Show the Florricks as a family
who had their troubles

03:32.250 --> 03:34.332
but stuck together,
came out stronger.

03:34.380 --> 03:37.167
We'll be talking to
the Iowa Commission on Family,

03:37.210 --> 03:39.121
Catholic Charities...

03:39.170 --> 03:40.649
And of course we'll need
Alicia to play ball.

03:40.690 --> 03:44.478
Oh, Ruth, I already gave you
Mrs. Florrick's schedule.

03:44.520 --> 03:46.693
Right, six days over
the next two months.

03:46.740 --> 03:48.048
Mm-hmm.

03:48.090 --> 03:49.045
Carl, we'll talk
about this later.

03:49.090 --> 03:50.432
Uh, I just want
to know,

03:50.490 --> 03:51.479
why is she controlling
the governor's agenda?

03:51.530 --> 03:53.134
Why are we dancing
to her tune?

03:53.180 --> 03:55.136
RUTH: No one is dancing
to anyone's tune.

03:55.190 --> 03:57.090
Alicia has a job,
she has responsibilities.

03:57.140 --> 03:58.880
Right, responsibilities,

03:58.930 --> 04:00.830
like defending murderers
and deadbeat dads.

04:00.890 --> 04:03.108
Carl, that's enough.

04:03.150 --> 04:05.937
I'm sure Eli's already talked
to Alicia about all this.

04:05.980 --> 04:08.028
CARL:
Have you, Eli?

04:08.070 --> 04:11.801
Have I talked to her
about defending murderers

04:11.860 --> 04:13.589
or how many days
she's giving the campaign?

04:13.640 --> 04:15.153
How many days...I want to hear from Ruth.

04:15.210 --> 04:17.553
I'm sure she can talk
for herself.

04:17.600 --> 04:19.511
We need more days, Eli.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.209
Twice as many.

04:25.430 --> 04:27.990
I want you
to stay here, Eli.

04:28.050 --> 04:30.951
Run Alicia's rehabilitation
from right here.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.820
From where? You have my office.

04:36.010 --> 04:37.739
Your new office.

04:37.790 --> 04:39.792
Oh, yeah, just a sec.

04:45.850 --> 04:47.977
How nice.

04:48.020 --> 04:49.976
A little tight; we're looking
for something bigger.

04:50.020 --> 04:52.636
But I know it's all
about the work for you.

04:52.680 --> 04:54.636
You can't harass me
out of my JOb.

04:54.680 --> 04:56.022
[chuckles]

04:56.070 --> 04:58.026
Now, why would I
want to do that?

04:58.080 --> 04:59.638
It'll be much more
fun watching you come

04:59.690 --> 05:01.203
into the office every day.

05:01.250 --> 05:04.071
Oh, and we need
Mrs. Florrick

05:04.120 --> 05:06.122
to appear on Mama's
Homespun Cooking.

05:07.210 --> 05:08.427
I'm sorry, what?

05:08.480 --> 05:09.959
Mama's Homespun Cooking.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.251
It's a cooking show.

05:11.310 --> 05:13.733
Daughters learn recipes
from their moms.

05:13.790 --> 05:17.749
You want Alicia _and Veronica
to do a cooking show?

05:17.790 --> 05:20.748
Yeah, "family first,"
"traditional values."

05:20.790 --> 05:22.007
Generational
post-feminist respect.

05:22.060 --> 05:25.439
Hillary with the
chocolate chip cookies.

05:25.490 --> 05:27.276
Yes, yes.

05:27.320 --> 05:29.185
Hillary with the
chocolate chip cookies.

05:29.240 --> 05:31.936
And what if I said Alicia and
Veronica would never do that?

05:31.980 --> 05:35.711
Then I would ask you to be a
professional and convince them.

05:40.770 --> 05:43.466
Sure.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.466
Congratulations, gentlemen,
you may think you're poor,

05:45.510 --> 05:48.126
but you are not poor enough
to have a public defender.

05:48.170 --> 05:50.479
So we have three bar attorneys
here for you today.

05:50.520 --> 05:52.078
If you want to find
your own attorney,

05:52.130 --> 05:53.438
you will have to wait
until tonight

05:53.480 --> 05:55.471
after the bond hearing,

05:55.520 --> 05:57.476
which of course will push
your hearing till tomorrow,

05:57.530 --> 05:59.134
but still it's up to you.

05:59.180 --> 06:00.169
Do you understand?

06:00.220 --> 06:01.778
Bully.

06:01.830 --> 06:03.969
Next, male 26--
uh, where are you?

06:04.010 --> 06:05.398
Let's get 12 more before lunch.

06:05.450 --> 06:06.872
Your Honor, this is
Mr. Howard's fifth arrest...

06:06.930 --> 06:08.795
Exactly, which is
why we ask that...

06:08.840 --> 06:10.273
Four times he_has
received ball,

06:10.320 --> 06:11.662
and all four times
he has shown up for

06:11.710 --> 06:12.847
his scheduled court appearance.Bully for him--

06:12.890 --> 06:15.199
he may be a thief
but he's a prompt thief.

06:15.240 --> 06:17.060
Your Honor...Bail is set at $30,000.

06:17.110 --> 06:18.361
Male 27, criminal
damage to property.

06:18.420 --> 06:19.978
Interesting strategy.

06:20.030 --> 06:21.986
Thanks.

06:22.030 --> 06:24.760
Male 28, manufacture
and distribution

06:24.810 --> 06:26.289
of a controlled substance.

06:26.340 --> 06:28.558
Uh, Mr. Roland... "Hah-lavin"?

06:28.600 --> 06:31.068
"Lavin," uh, it's okay--
everyone gets it wrong.

06:31.120 --> 06:32.599
Oh, sorry, Mr. Hlavin,
I'm Alicia Florrick.

06:32.650 --> 06:34.606
I'm a bar attorney
made available to you

06:34.650 --> 06:36.424
by the Chicago Bar Association
for your convenience.

06:36.480 --> 06:37.902
You're not required
to hire me...

06:37.960 --> 06:39.211
Uh, I know this.

06:39.260 --> 06:40.659
The judge already
said all this.

06:40.700 --> 06:42.088
So, uh, I want you.Good, thank you.

06:42.140 --> 06:44.392
Okay, this is your CBR;
it's how I get paid.

06:44.440 --> 06:47.398
My fee is standard,
$135 for the first day...

06:47.450 --> 06:49.873
Look, I used to work at the
Tower of Terror in Disneyland,

06:49.930 --> 06:52.888
so I had to say the same thing
over and over again for months.

06:52.930 --> 06:54.886
I'm very sympathetic to people

06:54.930 --> 06:56.272
who have to say
something by rote.

06:56.320 --> 06:57.457
Um, I'll just sign it.

06:58.540 --> 07:00.098
Okay, great.

07:00.150 --> 07:01.708
Are you currently employed?

07:01.760 --> 07:03.318
I wascurrently employed,

07:03.370 --> 07:04.541
and then they arrested
me, so now I'm not.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.114
Any ties to the community?

07:06.160 --> 07:07.286
Um, all my friends
are in California.

07:07.330 --> 07:08.763
Stanford, class of 2011.

07:08.810 --> 07:10.289
They built tech
start-ups, I came here,

07:10.340 --> 07:12.205
Okay, I don't need...I opened a chemistry lab,

07:12.250 --> 07:13.467
because I love
chemistry, you know?

07:13.520 --> 07:15.033
I love drugs. I don't...

07:15.080 --> 07:16.809
I mean, I don't
love using drugs...

07:16.870 --> 07:18.599
Okay, Mr. Hlavin, unfortunately
we don't have a lot of time.

07:18.650 --> 07:20.606
You_ were arrested
With someone.
Yeah, my dealer.

07:20.650 --> 07:22.049
I mean, not
my dealer.

07:22.090 --> 07:24.695
He's the dealer
who sold my GHB...

07:24.740 --> 07:27.743
SCHAKOWSKY: Male 28 and 29,
intent to manufacture and sell.

07:27.790 --> 07:29.348
ALICIA: Okay, let me talk
for you; don't say anything.

07:29.400 --> 07:31.356
That might be hard.I know, but try.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.356
ATTORNEY: Your Honor,
Mr. Roland Hlavin was caught

07:33.400 --> 07:35.140
manufacturing GHB
with the intent to sell,

07:35.190 --> 07:37.750
and Mr. Pierre-_Pau_l
was caught selling it.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.756
Your Honor, the state
has seized over $2 million

07:39.800 --> 07:41.279
of my client's money.

07:41.330 --> 07:43.275
He has been impoverished
by the state's actions.

07:43.330 --> 07:44.547
As has my client,
Your Honor.

07:44.590 --> 07:46.069
And now they want
to imprison him

07:46.110 --> 07:47.839
with _this onerous
bail amount.

07:47.900 --> 07:49.765
This is the definition
of cruel and unusual...SCHAKOWSKY: Really?

07:49.810 --> 07:51.858
Cruel andunusual?
Before lunch?

07:51.900 --> 07:54.368
Your Honor, my client just
wants his day in court.

07:54.430 --> 07:55.988
State requests
that bail be tied

07:56.040 --> 07:57.428
to the street value
of narcotic seized.

07:57.470 --> 07:59.938
Approved. Bail is set
at $300,000 each.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.604
Enjoy.

08:01.650 --> 08:02.867
I have an offer.

08:02.910 --> 08:04.605
For both of us?

08:04.650 --> 08:06.129
No, one of you.

08:06.180 --> 08:07.909
This case matters
to the state's attorney.

08:07.960 --> 08:09.393
He's offering an exploding plea.

08:09.440 --> 08:11.396
Oh, come on.

08:11.440 --> 08:13.396
We're not turning
on each other.

08:13.440 --> 08:14.748
Yeah, we're a
united front.

08:14.790 --> 08:16.314
One year to whoever jumps first.

08:16.360 --> 08:17.839
The other gets 25.

08:17.880 --> 08:19.882
Deal explodes
in 45 minutes.

08:19.930 --> 08:21.409
Starting now.

08:27.590 --> 08:30.058
One year, Roland,
that's the offer.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.670
If you don't take it,
your dealer friend will.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.324
He will go
to the prosecution

08:34.380 --> 08:35.893
and tell them everything
he knows about you.

08:35.950 --> 08:37.338
Every transaction,
how much you sold.

08:37.380 --> 08:39.848
How much you bought,
how much you paid.

08:39.910 --> 08:41.116
He'll turn on you.

08:41.170 --> 08:42.296
You have to
take this deal.

08:42.340 --> 08:44.160
And we only have 40 minutes.

08:44.210 --> 08:46.349
Yeah, but that means
going to jail, right?Yes, but...

08:46.390 --> 08:48.346
It's one year versus 25.

08:48.390 --> 08:50.699
This is a lifeline.What happened to
my "day in court"?

08:50.740 --> 08:52.913
That was just a strategy
to get you out on bail.

08:52.960 --> 08:53.915
But I think I want it, though.

08:53.960 --> 08:55.689
Roland.

08:55.750 --> 08:58.571
You were caught selling
50-gallon drums of GHB.

08:58.620 --> 09:00.099
Six of them...
No.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.448
Yes, six.
No, uh...

09:01.490 --> 09:02.969
All right, look.

09:03.020 --> 09:04.965
After Stanford,
I came back here.

09:05.020 --> 09:07.580
I got a job at IBM,

09:07.630 --> 09:10.326
but my brother,
he OD'd on GHB

09:10.370 --> 09:12.326
at a company party so I quit.

09:12.370 --> 09:15.021
Now, GHB gives the user
a feeling of euphoria,

09:15.070 --> 09:16.628
but take it in combination with alcohol and you stop breathing.

09:16.680 --> 09:18.636
Roland, we don't have
much time.

09:18.680 --> 09:20.375
I thought I could
make it safer.

09:20.420 --> 09:22.854
I felt like I owed
that to my brother.

09:22.910 --> 09:25.253
So I did.

09:25.300 --> 09:26.995
This is GHB.

09:27.040 --> 09:28.598
This is what I made.

09:28.650 --> 09:32.029
I call it "Snowball Chi,"
it's a designer drug.

09:32.090 --> 09:34.820
Your body turns it into GHB
on contact with stomach acid,

09:34.870 --> 09:37.612
but when you take it
or when I sell it...

09:37.660 --> 09:39.002
It isn't GHB.

09:39.050 --> 09:41.041
It isn't illegal.

09:44.360 --> 09:45.873
Damn it. I'll be right back.

09:48.670 --> 09:50.103
Don't make the deal.

09:50.150 --> 09:51.629
What deal?

09:51.670 --> 09:53.934
They weren't selling GHB--
it's a synthetic.

09:53.980 --> 09:56.232
It's not on the controlled
substances list.

09:56.290 --> 09:59.020
So? They'll say
it's an analogue.

09:59.070 --> 10:00.458
It's still illegal.

10:00.510 --> 10:01.932
They'll say it's
substantially similar.

10:01.990 --> 10:03.719
Not in chemical structure.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.465
They're just trying to get us
to jump because they know

10:05.510 --> 10:07.466
it's not a listed drug--
don't make the deal.

10:07.510 --> 10:08.681
I did.

10:08.730 --> 10:10.516
I already did.

10:10.560 --> 10:13.347
You just sent your client
to jail for no reason.

10:15.350 --> 10:18.308
Grace, hi, I need you to call
Jason, get him on an hourly.

10:18.350 --> 10:20.398
Tell him I need
an expert Witness

10:20.440 --> 10:22.396
on synthetic drugs.

10:22.440 --> 10:24.396
Okay, "synthetic drugs."

10:24.440 --> 10:25.657
Right. Which case is this?

10:25.710 --> 10:27.189
Roland Hlavin;

10:27.230 --> 10:28.925
There's a silent H
before "lavin."

10:28.970 --> 10:31.495
Oh, and I need a friend or
someone who can testify for him.

10:31.540 --> 10:32.359
Get me any background.

10:32.410 --> 10:33.752
This is a paying customer?

10:33.800 --> 10:35.051
Well, not yet.

10:35.110 --> 10:36.975
But he may be getting $2 million

10:37.020 --> 10:38.544
back from the police.Oh.

10:38.590 --> 10:39.454
Uh, got to go, Grace.

10:39.500 --> 10:40.762
I'll call you back.

10:40.810 --> 10:42.584
So, this is where
you work these days?

10:42.640 --> 10:44.119
Eli, I have allocution
in a minute.

10:44.160 --> 10:45.548
Can we do this another time?Do what?

10:45.600 --> 10:46.897
Whatever it is
you're here to do.

10:46.950 --> 10:48.110
Have you heard

10:48.160 --> 10:50.208
of Mama's Homespun Cooking?

10:50.250 --> 10:53.071
Do I...? What?

10:53.130 --> 10:54.688
Mama's Homespun Cooking.

10:54.740 --> 10:55.684
It's a cooking show.

10:55.740 --> 10:56.775
I need you go on it

10:56.830 --> 10:59.560
with Veronica tomorrow live.

10:59.610 --> 11:01.430
I know, that's what I
thought, too, at first.

11:01.480 --> 11:02.868
Okay, Eli.

11:02.920 --> 11:04.433
I'm a little too busy to deal

11:04.480 --> 11:06.357
with just random words

11:06.400 --> 11:07.833
spouﬁng
out of your mouth.

11:07.880 --> 11:09.222
Here's the thing--
you can be yourself.

11:09.270 --> 11:10.487
I want you to be yourself.

11:10.530 --> 11:11.576
On a cooking show?

11:11.620 --> 11:13.485
With my mother?
Yes.

11:13.540 --> 11:15.405
It'll be fun.
We'll have fun.

11:15.450 --> 11:16.701
And more importantly,
you say yes to this,

11:16.760 --> 11:18.489
you can say no to
a dozen other things.

11:18.540 --> 11:19.620
Why can't I say no

11:19.670 --> 11:21.103
to a dozen other things now?

11:21.150 --> 11:23.414
Because you want
to steer events.

11:23.460 --> 11:25.894
You don't want
events to steer you.

11:25.940 --> 11:28.591
[cell phone rings]

11:28.640 --> 11:30.540
Yes, this is Alicia Florrick.

11:30.600 --> 11:31.897
Who is this?

11:31.950 --> 11:33.292
Hi, it's Howard.

11:33.340 --> 11:34.853
Howard, I can't help you
right now.

11:34.910 --> 11:36.332
[stammers]
I just need something fast.

11:36.390 --> 11:37.869
Howard, I don't have the time.

11:37.910 --> 11:39.298
I need Jackie's number.

11:39.350 --> 11:40.419
You...?Jackie Florrick.

11:40.480 --> 11:42.038
Why?

11:42.090 --> 11:43.569
I want to ask her out.

11:44.830 --> 11:46.604
Mr. Hav-lavin, on the charge

11:46.660 --> 11:48.480
of manufacturing a
controlled substance,

11:48.530 --> 11:49.656
how do you plead?

11:49.700 --> 11:50.746
Where's your lawyer?

11:50.790 --> 11:52.223
Here, Your Honor.

11:52.270 --> 11:53.578
And why aren't you here?

11:53.620 --> 11:55.133
I am now, Judge.

11:55.190 --> 11:57.829
Mr. Hlavinpleads not guilty.

11:57.890 --> 11:59.835
Ah, okay.

11:59.890 --> 12:01.881
And Mr. Pierre-Paul,
you are charged

12:01.930 --> 12:03.454
with just one count
of distribution.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.934
How do you plead?

12:09.550 --> 12:11.768
Counselor,

12:11.810 --> 12:15.280
are we having a moment
of reflection here?

12:18.040 --> 12:20.258
Lucca?

12:20.300 --> 12:21.904
[whispers]:
Don't take the plea.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.952
Uh, not guilty?

12:24.000 --> 12:25.649
ATTORNEY:
Your Honor, I...

12:25.700 --> 12:27.645
The defendant
reversed herself.

12:27.700 --> 12:29.429
We, we had a deal.

12:29.480 --> 12:31.562
Well, first of all,
the defendant is a he.

12:31.620 --> 12:32.780
And second of all,
that deal has nothing

12:32.830 --> 12:34.263
to do with this court,
Mr. McGrath.

12:34.310 --> 12:35.447
If she says yes to you,

12:35.490 --> 12:36.741
she can change her mind.

12:36.790 --> 12:38.610
We are set for pre-trial
motions this afternoon.

12:38.670 --> 12:39.796
I imagine you're moving

12:39.840 --> 12:41.398
to dismiss, Counselors?

12:41.450 --> 12:42.496
BOTH:
Yes, Your Honor.

12:42.540 --> 12:43.928
Bully, we're done here.

12:43.980 --> 12:45.402
Lunch.

12:47.070 --> 12:49.630
You screw me like that
and I will screw you back.

12:49.680 --> 12:51.022
Have at it.

12:51.070 --> 12:53.800
Okay, I just made an
enemy I don't need.

12:53.860 --> 12:56.328
This better work.

13:09.220 --> 13:11.654
No one reaches
the summit on her own.

13:11.700 --> 13:12.826
Women help women.

13:12.870 --> 13:14.565
I've_ mentored
exceptional women.

13:16.140 --> 13:18.392
But_ now that she's
running her own firm,

13:18.440 --> 13:21.659
I would like
to mentor someone new.

13:21.710 --> 13:23.666
And I'd like it to be you.

13:23.710 --> 13:26.099
Naomi,
your work is very good,

13:26.150 --> 13:27.629
very diligent.

13:27.670 --> 13:30.457
And I think your legal opinions
are sometimes bold.

13:30.500 --> 13:31.671
Never pays
to be conservative.

13:31.720 --> 13:32.675
Thank you.

13:32.720 --> 13:34.324
So, I'd like to meet

13:34.370 --> 13:36.019
once a week or so

13:36.070 --> 13:37.628
and talk about strategies

13:37.680 --> 13:39.898
for advancement.

13:39.940 --> 13:42.989
Will it mean more hours?

13:43.030 --> 13:44.201
No.

13:44.250 --> 13:47.128
I only ask
because I'm not sure

13:47.170 --> 13:47.989
I can squeeze it all in.

13:48.040 --> 13:49.519
I have a boyfriend now.

13:49.560 --> 13:51.733
We met online.

13:51.780 --> 13:53.771
[clears her throat]

13:55.530 --> 13:56.656
You understand

13:56.700 --> 13:58.474
this is an honor?

13:58.530 --> 14:00.486
Yes, completely.

14:00.530 --> 14:02.703
And thank you.
It's just...

14:02.750 --> 14:04.570
Ryan's on the fast
track at Belvedere

14:04.620 --> 14:06.668
and we're trying to keep
some time for each other.

14:06.710 --> 14:08.530
I'm worried_abou_t
my last relationship.

14:08.580 --> 14:10.798
I was so focused on my career
and where that was headed

14:10.850 --> 14:13.717
that I completely cut out
any romantic ties in my life.

14:13.760 --> 14:15.148
And now it's been
about three years

14:15.200 --> 14:16.883
since I even went on a date

14:16.940 --> 14:19.192
And then I met Ryan online and
that was really exciting for me.

14:19.240 --> 14:21.117
And he has the most
beautiful hair.

14:21.160 --> 14:23.594
Do these new summer interns
seem less committed to you?

14:23.640 --> 14:25.858
CARY:
No. Do they to you?

14:25.900 --> 14:26.889
Yes.

14:26.950 --> 14:28.429
Well, I think

14:28.470 --> 14:29.858
every outgoing
generation of lavwers

14:29.910 --> 14:31.161
looks at the incoming crop

14:31.210 --> 14:32.643
and thinks they're not worthy.

14:32.690 --> 14:33.645
Yes.

14:33.690 --> 14:35.123
But this generation isn't.

14:35.170 --> 14:36.694
They're worried
about their boyfriends

14:36.740 --> 14:38.605
and their long workdays.

14:38.660 --> 14:40.878
They're looking for more
balance in their lives.

14:40.920 --> 14:42.137
More leisure time.

14:42.180 --> 14:44.910
That's a good thing.

14:44.970 --> 14:47.700
Let's get the equity
partners together today.

14:47.750 --> 14:48.796
Okay, why?

14:48.840 --> 14:51.445
To talk about Alicia.

14:51.490 --> 14:54.926
MAN:
Like GHB, tert-Butyl
4-hydroxybutanoate

14:54.980 --> 14:58.063
contains a gammahydroxycarbonyl
moiety.

14:58.110 --> 14:59.805
But that's the
only similarity.

14:59.850 --> 15:02.671
The change in the chemical
design is really quite elegant

15:02.720 --> 15:04.938
when you look at it.Thank you.

15:04.990 --> 15:06.241
SCHAKOWSKY:
No, no, sir, this is not

15:06.290 --> 15:07.894
your courtroom; it's mine.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.759
Our apologies, Your Honor.
It won't happen again.

15:09.820 --> 15:12.243
And this new chemical compound

15:12.300 --> 15:14.598
that my client created--

15:14.650 --> 15:15.685
_ it contains
no illegal attributes?

15:15.740 --> 15:16.946
That is correct.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.558
Tert-Butyl 4-hydroxybutanoate

15:18.610 --> 15:21.955
is electrically
neutral, while GHB

15:22.000 --> 15:24.343
is an ionic compound.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.743
So, would that be like

15:26.790 --> 15:28.872
the difference
between Coke and Pepsi?

15:28.920 --> 15:32.617
No, it's more like

15:32.670 --> 15:36.310
the difference between
a butyrate-Co-A ligase

15:36.370 --> 15:39.146
and a glycine
N-acyltransferase.

15:39.190 --> 15:40.976
Thank you, Doctor.

15:41.020 --> 15:43.580
McGRATH:
Dr. Marcotte,
the Federal Analogue Act

15:43.630 --> 15:46.542
does not require that a drug be
listed as a controlled substance

15:46.590 --> 15:47.989
for it to be illegal--
is that correct?

15:48.030 --> 15:49.725
That's my understanding.

15:49.770 --> 15:51.078
If it is substantially similar
to a controlled substance,

15:51.120 --> 15:52.553
it is treated
as though it were

15:52.600 --> 15:54.329
a controlled substance?Objection.

15:54.380 --> 15:55.984
The witness is not qualified
to answer a legal question.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.940
And yet, this is
a motion to dismiss.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.558
And as much as you three
are treating it

15:59.610 --> 16:01.089
like a full-on trial,
I have a life,

16:01.130 --> 16:02.904
I'd like to get back to it,
so overruled.

16:02.960 --> 16:04.643
McGRATH: Do you want me to
repeat the question, Doctor?

16:04.700 --> 16:06.304
No, you are correct.

16:06.350 --> 16:07.999
An analogue of
a drug is treated,

16:08.050 --> 16:09.699
under the law,
as an illegal drug.

16:09.750 --> 16:10.910
And isn't it also true

16:10.970 --> 16:12.653
that no matter
how elegant the defendant's

16:12.710 --> 16:13.654
attempt to elude
the law is...

16:13.710 --> 16:14.745
Objection!

16:14.790 --> 16:15.609
I'll rephrase.

16:15.670 --> 16:16.614
No matter how elegant

16:16.670 --> 16:19.446
this new chemical compound is,

16:19.500 --> 16:21.445
the high associated with it
is identical to GHB?

16:21.500 --> 16:24.014
Yes, that is definitely true.

16:24.070 --> 16:26.277
Your Honor, once again,
the Federal Analogue Act

16:26.330 --> 16:28.890
makes it illegal to produce
or sell any drug that is only

16:28.940 --> 16:30.714
a few molecules away
from a controlled substance.

16:30.770 --> 16:32.192
It's not a few molecules away.

16:32.250 --> 16:33.729
It is the difference...

16:33.770 --> 16:35.328
Between Coke and Pepsi--
yes, I get it.

16:35.380 --> 16:36.768
Points for making
this folksy,

16:36.820 --> 16:39.425
Counselor, but your motion

16:39.470 --> 16:41.074
to dismiss is denied.
[bangs gavel]

16:41.130 --> 16:43.121
Damn it.
I thought we had it.

16:44.650 --> 16:46.868
What?

16:46.910 --> 16:49.731
We still might.

16:52.400 --> 16:54.561
Oh, thank you.

16:54.620 --> 16:55.871
This is your office?

16:55.920 --> 16:58.525
Yes, I'm thinking
of having it painted.

16:58.580 --> 17:00.798
What do you think?Hmm.

17:00.840 --> 17:02.831
Oh, um, excuse me.
Uh...

17:02.890 --> 17:04.141
Oh, well...

17:04.190 --> 17:06.624
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.

17:06.670 --> 17:07.978
Oh, I...
I'm still moving in.

17:08.020 --> 17:09.806
Yeah, yes.
I can see that.

17:12.290 --> 17:13.541
Um... Oh, oh, no...

17:13.590 --> 17:15.638
No, I'll go back here.
Okay.

17:15.680 --> 17:17.238
Okay.

17:17.290 --> 17:19.815
Um, Mr. Gold?

17:19.860 --> 17:21.248
I really don't know
how I can help you.

17:21.300 --> 17:24.645
In fact, I-I don't
know if the governor

17:24.690 --> 17:26.078
would want me to help him.

17:26.130 --> 17:27.859
Well, we're trying to show

17:27.910 --> 17:30.219
what a strong family
Peter has.
[laughs]

17:30.260 --> 17:31.773
Oh, sorry.

17:31.830 --> 17:33.866
And there's something
you can help us with.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.046
Have you heard of...

17:35.090 --> 17:36.955
Mama's Homespun Cooking?

17:37.010 --> 17:38.875
No, I haven't.

17:38.920 --> 17:40.399
What is that?

17:40.450 --> 17:41.610
It's a reality show.

17:41.660 --> 17:43.093
Oh, sounds delightful.

17:43.140 --> 17:44.835
And I'd like you
to appear on it with Alicia.

17:44.880 --> 17:47.622
Oh...
[laughing]

17:47.670 --> 17:50.275
Sorry.
It's-it's-it's
a show where you would

17:50.330 --> 17:52.195
teach Alicia a recipe.

17:52.240 --> 17:54.492
[laughing]:
Oh, sorry.

17:54.550 --> 17:56.677
A new recipe she would then
cook for her family.

17:56.720 --> 17:59.848
[grunting, laughing]

17:59.900 --> 18:00.798
And I'd love for you
to participate.

18:02.770 --> 18:05.500
for the world.

18:05.560 --> 18:06.811
Okay, a few updates.

18:06.860 --> 18:08.589
The Turnbow depositions
will start on Wednesday.

18:08.650 --> 18:09.776
What about
the Cliven-Hartford suit?

18:09.820 --> 18:10.991
Settled.

18:11.040 --> 18:13.907
$1.2 million in damages

18:13.960 --> 18:18.397
and remediation for
facilities in Peoria.

18:18.440 --> 18:21.136
Well, someone had
a good nap.

18:21.180 --> 18:23.569
[laughter]

18:23.620 --> 18:25.520
Would you mind
repeating that?

18:25.580 --> 18:26.797
What?

18:26.840 --> 18:28.319
I just want to make sure
everybody heard it.

18:28.360 --> 18:29.406
Oh, it was a joke.

18:29.450 --> 18:30.838
I know.
Could you say it

18:30.890 --> 18:32.881
exactly the way you
said it before?

18:32.930 --> 18:35.933
I said,
"Someone had a good nap."

18:35.980 --> 18:36.878
Thank you.

18:36.940 --> 18:39.158
Carry on.
Yes.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.805
Well, now that
we're all up to speed,

18:41.850 --> 18:43.761
uh, I want to discuss Alicia.

18:43.810 --> 18:46.199
I think we should turn
the temperature down with her.

18:46.250 --> 18:47.592
Do you want to invite her back?

18:47.640 --> 18:48.811
We do that,

18:48.860 --> 18:50.111
we lose Reese Dipple's business.

18:50.170 --> 18:51.512
I'm afraid David's right,

18:51.560 --> 18:52.549
but we could feed her
our overflow.

18:52.600 --> 18:53.555
Overflow?

18:53.610 --> 18:54.645
YOU mean overflow cases?

18:54.690 --> 18:55.736
Yes, it's financially

18:55.780 --> 18:56.860
negligible to us,

18:56.910 --> 18:58.172
but it could help her.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.175
It could also help
neutralize her

18:59.220 --> 19:00.175
as a potential pawn for Canning.

19:00.220 --> 19:01.733
She'll be our pawn instead.

19:01.790 --> 19:02.916
Mm-hmm.

19:02.960 --> 19:05.224
Howard?
Oh...

19:05.270 --> 19:07.488
I'm checking to
see who's here.

19:07.530 --> 19:09.088
[cell phone ringing]

19:09.140 --> 19:11.870
Oh, would you excuse me?

19:11.930 --> 19:13.795
DIANE: Uh, are there
any opinions on this sub...?

19:13.840 --> 19:16.445
This is Howard.

19:16.500 --> 19:20.197
Oh, hello, this is Jackie
Florrick returning your call.

19:20.240 --> 19:22.105
Uh, did you need
Alicia's number?

19:22.160 --> 19:24.242
Oh, no, I was calling for you.

19:24.290 --> 19:26.110
Oh.

19:26.160 --> 19:28.287
Uh...

19:28.340 --> 19:30.979
Well, well, how may I help you?

19:31.030 --> 19:32.850
I, uh, haven't
done this in quite a while,

19:32.910 --> 19:34.514
so I'm a, I'm a little rusty,

19:34.560 --> 19:35.993
but, uh,

19:36.040 --> 19:37.996
would you like
to have dinner with me?

19:41.220 --> 19:42.209
Intent.

19:42.260 --> 19:44.569
What "intent"?

19:44.610 --> 19:46.566
The Federal Analogue Act

19:46.620 --> 19:48.303
has a scienter requirement.

19:48.360 --> 19:49.873
You have to know
what you were d0ing.

19:49.920 --> 19:52.480
You had to know that you were
making an analogue drug.

19:52.530 --> 19:55.055
Yes, but Roland did know.

19:55.100 --> 19:56.886
He knew he was making
an analogue of GHB.

19:56.930 --> 19:59.979
Yes, but he hasn't
testified to that.

20:00.020 --> 20:02.363
Look, my client

20:02.410 --> 20:04.492
didn't know he was
buying an analogue to GHB.

20:04.550 --> 20:06.802
He thought he was buying GHB.

20:06.850 --> 20:09.808
So he can't be prosecuted for
buying a controlled substance,

20:09.860 --> 20:11.805
because it wasn't one.

20:11.860 --> 20:13.896
He can only be prosecuted
for purchasing an analogue,

20:13.950 --> 20:17.772
but only if he knew
it was an analogue,

20:17.820 --> 20:19.776
which he didn't.

20:19.820 --> 20:22.687
It's a catch-22.

20:22.740 --> 20:25.038
Yes. A very neat one.

20:25.090 --> 20:28.082
But it only works
for my client...

20:28.130 --> 20:30.269
if he thought he was
making actual GHB,

20:30.310 --> 20:31.789
not an analogue.

20:31.830 --> 20:34.048
That's right.

20:35.880 --> 20:36.960
You're not a chemist,
Roland.

20:37.010 --> 20:38.614
You studied _
computer SCIence, right?

20:38.670 --> 20:40.319
Yeah, but I did
a lot of research.

20:40.360 --> 20:41.361
I mean, you know,

20:41.410 --> 20:42.365
I love learning.

20:42.410 --> 20:44.014
Wait, hold on.

20:44.060 --> 20:46.494
Is there a chance
that while you, in fact,

20:46.540 --> 20:48.758
made tert-Butyl whatever,

20:48.810 --> 20:50.584
you were trying
to make GHB?

20:50.640 --> 20:52.710
Tert-Butyl 4-hydroxybutanoate.

20:52.770 --> 20:53.930
_ _ Your intent
is important here.

20:53.990 --> 20:56.072
What you intended to do.

20:56.120 --> 20:57.599
[stammers]
No.

20:57.640 --> 20:58.720
Wait.

20:58.770 --> 21:00.169
Don't say anything yet.

21:00.210 --> 21:04.123
You can't be convicted
of making GHB,

21:04.170 --> 21:05.865
because it wasn't GHB.

21:05.910 --> 21:08.697
You can only be convicted
of making an analogue.

21:08.740 --> 21:11.959
But if you thought
you were making GHB...

21:12.000 --> 21:15.128
if you didn't know
you had created an analogue...

21:15.180 --> 21:16.431
No intent.

21:16.490 --> 21:17.741
Right.

21:17.790 --> 21:20.008
To be clear,

21:20.060 --> 21:22.745
I'm just telling you
what your dealer

21:22.800 --> 21:24.051
is going to testify to.

21:24.100 --> 21:27.012
I'm saying that
could be your defense,

21:27.060 --> 21:29.756
if you were trying
to make GHB.

21:29.810 --> 21:33.496
So... no rush.

21:33.550 --> 21:36.110
Take a moment
and think.

21:39.030 --> 21:40.338
So what were you
trying to make?

21:40.380 --> 21:42.507
GHB.

21:42.560 --> 21:45.779
So you never intended
to make an analogue drug.

21:45.820 --> 21:47.128
ROLAND:
Uh, no.

21:47.170 --> 21:48.159
I thought I was making
the real thing.

21:48.210 --> 21:49.472
McGRATH:
Objection.

21:49.520 --> 21:51.340
What's your objection?

21:51.390 --> 21:52.778
He's just admitted he was trying

21:52.830 --> 21:54.695
to manufacture
a controlled substance.

21:54.740 --> 21:56.526
Yes, but he didn't succeed in
making a controlled substance.

21:56.570 --> 22:00.097
He made an analogue-- I imagine
you're arguing "by accident."

22:00.140 --> 22:01.744
Yes, Your Honor.SCHAKOWSKY:
It's a little cute,

22:01.790 --> 22:04.964
but it does put you in a bind,
Mr. ASA.

22:05.010 --> 22:07.228
This is semantics.No. It's the law.

22:07.280 --> 22:10.363
You know the difference?
I get a gavel.

22:10.410 --> 22:13.140
Your Honor, we move to dismiss.McGRATH:
Hold on, I still get to cross.

22:13.200 --> 22:16.624
SCHAKOWSKY:
You do. Mrs. Florrick,
keep your motion handy.

22:16.680 --> 22:18.636
McGRATH:
Mr. Hlavin,

22:18.680 --> 22:20.375
how did you know
how to make GHB?

22:20.420 --> 22:21.808
Read it online.

22:21.860 --> 22:24.158
And if you were trying
to make GHB,

22:24.210 --> 22:25.552
why did you give
it a new name?

22:25.600 --> 22:26.908
Snowball Chi sounded cooler.

22:26.950 --> 22:29.293
I'm pretty good
at marketing.

22:29.340 --> 22:30.819
I mean, I'm pretty
good at most things.

22:30.870 --> 22:32.121
McGRATH:
Not at making GHB,
apparently.

22:32.170 --> 22:33.034
Excuse me?

22:33.090 --> 22:35.035
I'm just saying

22:35.090 --> 22:36.079
you set out
to make one thing

22:36.130 --> 22:37.381
and you made
something else.

22:37.440 --> 22:38.953
That's a failure.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.308
Objection, Your Honor.
Badgering the witness.

22:40.350 --> 22:41.612
It's not much of a badger.
Overruled.

22:41.660 --> 22:44.879
I didn't... it's not a failure.

22:44.920 --> 22:46.057
You've never held a job
in chemistry, have you?

22:46.100 --> 22:47.089
No. So what?

22:47.140 --> 22:48.482
And you were
arrested during

22:48.540 --> 22:49.882
your third
drug deal?
Fourth.

22:49.930 --> 22:50.965
McGRATH:
So you're not
one of these

22:51.020 --> 22:52.703
designer drug
geniuses.

22:52.760 --> 22:54.660
You didn't make something
safer or smarter or better.

22:54.720 --> 22:56.494
You're just a kid who
tried to make something

22:56.540 --> 22:58.588
off the Internet
and you botched the job!

22:58.630 --> 23:01.064
No, it is better.Oh, so you knew you were
making something different?

23:01.110 --> 23:03.283
I knew I was making something
that saves lives.

23:03.330 --> 23:04.547
McGRATH:
Not like GHB?

23:04.600 --> 23:06.374
ROLAND:
That's right!

23:08.510 --> 23:09.989
Thank you.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.382
No further
questions.

23:11.430 --> 23:12.681
SCHAKOWSKY:
Mrs. Florrick,

23:12.730 --> 23:14.732
your motion to dismiss
is denied.

23:14.780 --> 23:16.338
Your client will stand trial.

23:16.390 --> 23:18.381
[gavel bangs, phone buzzing]

23:23.530 --> 23:25.043
Yeah. Hey, Grace, what's up?

23:25.090 --> 23:26.967
There's something up
with your client.

23:27.010 --> 23:28.090
He didn't go to Stanford.

23:28.140 --> 23:29.357
Yes, he did. Class of 2011.

23:29.400 --> 23:31.004
No-- yes.

23:31.060 --> 23:32.573
I mean, yes,
he's on the alumni Web site,

23:32.620 --> 23:34.178
but I called the school.

23:34.230 --> 23:35.834
They don't have a record
of anyone with that name.

23:35.890 --> 23:37.448
Even
NetherdoesIBM.

23:37.500 --> 23:39.229
And the home address
on his arrest report?

23:39.280 --> 23:40.360
There's a Cuban family
living there.

23:40.410 --> 23:42.799
Grace, what's going on?

23:42.850 --> 23:44.101
I have no idea.

23:44.160 --> 23:46.196
But your client
doesn't seem to exist.

24:00.390 --> 24:03.041
ALICIA: I have to be out
of here in an hour, Eli.VERONICA: Me, too.

24:03.090 --> 24:05.081
Why? Where are you going?

24:05.130 --> 24:06.779
I have things to do.

24:06.830 --> 24:10.004
You're not the only person
who works, you know.

24:10.050 --> 24:12.006
I hear you're
punishing yourself.

24:12.050 --> 24:13.392
Punishing?

24:13.450 --> 24:14.667
That's what
Owen says.

24:14.710 --> 24:16.007
Working for
nothing,

24:16.060 --> 24:17.049
helping the great unwashed.

24:17.100 --> 24:19.887
I'm starting over,

24:19.930 --> 24:21.010
and it's a good feeling.

24:21.060 --> 24:22.493
Like every new husband.
A good feeling--

24:22.540 --> 24:25.065
for the first
few months, then...

24:25.110 --> 24:27.021
Why isn't Peter helping you?

24:27.070 --> 24:29.026
Eli?Don't ask me.

24:29.070 --> 24:31.721
Alicia?
Mom, have you
been drinking?

24:31.770 --> 24:34.238
What? No.
It's 2:00 in the afternoon.

24:34.290 --> 24:36.110
ALICIA:
I can smell it
on your breath.

24:36.170 --> 24:38.115
I had a little wine at lunch,
but I haven't been drinking.

24:38.170 --> 24:41.128
Oh, my God.
Let's go, ladies.
We're gonna have some fun.

24:41.170 --> 24:42.250
[Veronica laughs]ALICIA:
Uh, yeah.

24:42.300 --> 24:43.608
I'll be there in a second.

24:43.650 --> 24:46.039
Eli, get her some mints
or something.

24:46.090 --> 24:48.126
GRACE:
So I couldn't find any other
discrepancies in his story.

24:48.180 --> 24:49.340
He's all over
soaal media.

24:49.400 --> 24:50.651
He's bragging
about his new drug,

24:50.700 --> 24:52.133
talking about
his brother.

24:52.180 --> 24:53.226
But...?

24:53.270 --> 24:54.874
But then I ran
his mug shot

24:54.920 --> 24:56.319
through facial
recognition software

24:56.360 --> 24:57.611
and I got a hit.

24:57.670 --> 24:59.183
You did all that?

24:59.230 --> 25:00.276
I know.

25:00.320 --> 25:02.276
Well, Zach helped.

25:02.320 --> 25:03.400
ALICIA:
So what is it?

25:03.450 --> 25:04.929
GRACE:
Roland.

25:04.980 --> 25:06.402
But he's in a group
of FBI agents.

25:06.460 --> 25:08.234
He's FBI?

25:08.280 --> 25:10.419
GRACE:
If that's him, he is.

25:10.460 --> 25:12.849
Mrs. Florrick,
ready to go.

25:15.200 --> 25:16.758
So, as a working woman--

25:16.810 --> 25:18.289
the mother of two,

25:18.340 --> 25:19.762
not to mention the
Wife of the governor--

25:19.820 --> 25:21.549
how do you do it?

25:21.600 --> 25:23.989
Manage it all?Oh, well, with great help
from my mother.

25:24.040 --> 25:25.644
She's always there
When you need her.

25:25.690 --> 25:28.386
So, What's your go-to meal,
Veronica?

25:28.430 --> 25:31.081
Well, Mama Jill,

25:31.130 --> 25:33.473
I'd have to say that right now,
it's ordering pizza.

25:33.530 --> 25:34.827
[laughing]:
Well, there's nothing wrong

25:34.880 --> 25:35.824
With that, is there?

25:35.880 --> 25:37.131
Every once in a while.

25:37.180 --> 25:38.488
But today
you're gonna teach Alicia

25:38.530 --> 25:41.795
how to make
your speCIal lasagna.

25:41.840 --> 25:43.273
Yes, my special
lasagna.

25:43.320 --> 25:45.276
You remember, dear,

25:45.320 --> 25:47.368
my special lasagna that I made
for you all those years?

25:47.410 --> 25:49.366
Yes, Mom,
I can't wait to taste it.

25:49.410 --> 25:51.139
You may have
noticed the tone

25:51.200 --> 25:52.451
of Alicia's voice.

25:52.500 --> 25:53.751
The irony in it.

25:53.810 --> 25:55.289
I guess
I just wasn't

25:55.330 --> 25:57.150
a very good cook when
she was growing up.

25:57.200 --> 25:59.065
But you must be making up
for lost time.

25:59.120 --> 26:01.076
Yes, I've had to
step up, haven't I?

26:01.120 --> 26:03.372
Oh, really?
Is that What this has been?

26:03.430 --> 26:05.079
Yes. It has.

26:05.120 --> 26:06.644
Oh, I know, you're
making fun, but it has.

26:06.690 --> 26:09.124
Ever since, you know...
the issues.
Mom...

26:09.170 --> 26:11.343
Yeah, what I mean
to say is, a mother

26:11.390 --> 26:14.655
needs to be With her daughter
When things get... difficult.

26:14.700 --> 26:16.304
MAMA JILL:
So what other preparation...And when I say "difficult,"

26:16.350 --> 26:18.341
I'm not talking
about marital difficulties.

26:18.400 --> 26:19.788
ALICIA: Mom, why don't we
just change the subject?

26:19.830 --> 26:21.309
Don't patronize me.

26:21.360 --> 26:22.918
Get me Eli Gold!

26:22.970 --> 26:24.483
VERONICA: I'm not saying
What you think I'm saying.

26:24.530 --> 26:25.747
I stayed away
for two years

26:25.800 --> 26:27.097
because you
didn't call me.

26:27.150 --> 26:28.401
ALICIA:
Mom, I didn't call you

26:28.450 --> 26:29.792
because I didn't know
Where you were.

26:29.840 --> 26:32.058
MAMA JILL:
So what about this lasagna?

26:34.540 --> 26:36.019
Thought you might've
forgotten me.

26:36.070 --> 26:37.935
Who was your faculty
advisor at Stanford?

26:37.980 --> 26:41.325
What?
In the computer
science department.

26:41.380 --> 26:43.154
Um, no one
in particular.But what was his name?

26:43.210 --> 26:45.337
Um... I don't know.

26:45.380 --> 26:47.371
Why is there a Cuban family
living in your apartment?

26:47.430 --> 26:49.421
Maybe you called
the wrong number?

26:49.470 --> 26:51.552
What's the right number?

26:51.610 --> 26:53.259
Why are you asking me this?

26:53.300 --> 26:54.949
Because you're not
Who you say you are.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.560
And you sabotaged
my defense strategy

26:57.610 --> 26:59.043
and I want to know why.Look, I didn't
mean to.

26:59.090 --> 27:00.739
I'm sorry, I...

27:00.790 --> 27:02.303
lost my temper.

27:08.360 --> 27:10.920
That's you.

27:10.970 --> 27:13.313
Are you in bed with the FBI?

27:13.370 --> 27:14.405
Are you an informant?

27:14.450 --> 27:16.054
That's not me, Mrs. Florrick.

27:16.110 --> 27:18.453
You don't have to lie to me.

27:18.500 --> 27:20.968
You're covered _
by attorney-client prIVIlege.

27:23.380 --> 27:24.938
Okay.

27:24.990 --> 27:26.241
So this is What's
going to happen:

27:26.290 --> 27:27.939
I'm going to the judge

27:27.990 --> 27:31.642
and I'm going to ask to be
relieved as your attorney.

27:31.690 --> 27:32.907
I can't let you do that.

27:32.950 --> 27:34.815
You have no choice.Yeah, I do.

27:34.870 --> 27:36.815
I don't think you want
me going to the judge

27:36.870 --> 27:38.906
and telling him how you got me
to perjure myself.

27:40.700 --> 27:41.917
What did you say?

27:41.960 --> 27:43.689
No, it's What you said.

27:43.740 --> 27:47.358
"You can't be convicted
of making GHB if it wasn't GHB.

27:47.400 --> 27:49.652
"You can only be convicted
of making an analogue.

27:49.710 --> 27:52.315
But if you thought
you were making GHB..."

27:52.360 --> 27:53.486
I never told you to lie.

27:53.540 --> 27:55.349
In fact, I explicitly
told you not to lie.

27:55.410 --> 27:57.446
Let's let the judge decide.

27:59.500 --> 28:00.717
Who are you?

28:00.760 --> 28:02.318
Doesn't matter.

28:02.370 --> 28:04.418
All that matters is_ that
you keep representing me

28:04.460 --> 28:06.416
until I get my day in court.

28:15.120 --> 28:17.259
Eli?
Over here.

28:17.300 --> 28:18.597
This is your office?

28:18.650 --> 28:19.947
I know.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.993
But once I get
some plants and pictures...

28:24.050 --> 28:25.608
I think it could
really be something.

28:27.400 --> 28:29.391
What's wrong?

28:29.440 --> 28:31.431
[sighs]

28:31.490 --> 28:33.219
I'm being set up.

28:34.530 --> 28:36.179
No, Ruth wouldn't go after you.

28:36.230 --> 28:37.663
Not Ruth.

28:37.710 --> 28:38.961
The FBI.

28:39.020 --> 28:40.362
What are you talking about?

28:40.410 --> 28:43.106
I have a client who
I thought was a drug designer.

28:43.150 --> 28:44.879
But I think
he's an FBI informant.

28:44.940 --> 28:46.589
As part of his defense,

28:46.630 --> 28:49.679
I was walking him through
a few different case scenarios.

28:49.720 --> 28:51.415
[sighs]

28:51.460 --> 28:52.449
I explained

28:52.510 --> 28:54.466
the implications
of each

28:54.510 --> 28:57.115
and I let him decide
how he wanted to testify.

28:57.170 --> 29:00.685
Is that a lawyerly way of saying
you helped him lie?

29:00.730 --> 29:02.607
No.

29:04.740 --> 29:06.560
But it could be
interpreted that way.

29:08.960 --> 29:10.734
What are you thinking?

29:10.790 --> 29:12.212
Enemies of Peter?

29:12.270 --> 29:13.350
Or you.

29:15.530 --> 29:16.781
It's a primary.

29:16.840 --> 29:18.091
Anything could happen.

29:18.140 --> 29:19.220
So what do I do?

29:19.270 --> 29:20.225
Just... let me find out
What's happening

29:20.280 --> 29:22.009
and I'll get
back to you.

29:22.060 --> 29:23.755
Oh, wait, was the strategy yours

29:23.800 --> 29:25.051
to get your client to lie?

29:25.110 --> 29:26.270
It wasn't a lie.

29:26.320 --> 29:28.106
Okay. Okay.
But was the strategy yours?

29:28.150 --> 29:30.459
Y...

29:30.500 --> 29:32.320
No. It wasn't.

29:32.370 --> 29:34.509
Whose was it?

29:34.550 --> 29:36.677
Eli, you're not...

29:36.730 --> 29:38.675
Oh, Mrs. Florrick, hello.

29:38.730 --> 29:40.595
Ruth.Thank you for
your time today.

29:40.640 --> 29:41.902
Cooking.

29:41.950 --> 29:43.030
ALICIA:
Oh, well...

29:43.080 --> 29:44.468
Yes, it was a...

29:44.520 --> 29:45.771
unusualexpenence.

29:45.820 --> 29:47.162
I hope you got
What you needed out of it.

29:47.220 --> 29:49.347
A lot came out of it.

29:49.390 --> 29:50.516
I just Wish we
had another chair.

29:50.570 --> 29:51.605
We could have
a prayer Circle.

29:51.650 --> 29:52.912
Um, well, I should go.

29:52.960 --> 29:53.824
Thank you, Eli.

29:53.870 --> 29:55.872
RUTH:
I'm gonna get in here.

29:55.920 --> 29:58.309
Mm-hmm.

29:58.360 --> 29:59.611
Excuse me.

29:59.660 --> 30:00.911
Thank-- bye.

30:00.970 --> 30:02.005
Bye-bye.

30:04.010 --> 30:05.409
You told her to tank
the cooking show?

30:05.450 --> 30:06.758
I didn't need to.

30:06.800 --> 30:08.313
Alicia and her mom
do not have

30:08.370 --> 30:10.099
What you would call a
"traditional" relationship.

30:10.150 --> 30:11.139
If you'd worked
With her longer,

30:11.200 --> 30:12.497
you would know that.

30:12.540 --> 30:14.542
When you hurt me,
you hurt Peter.

30:14.590 --> 30:16.638
I do not want to hurt
either of you.

30:18.070 --> 30:21.983
Eli Gold, What am I
gonna do With you?

30:23.120 --> 30:25.076
You could quit.

30:25.120 --> 30:26.849
GRACE:
My mom should be here soon.

30:26.910 --> 30:27.899
Can I get you anything?

30:27.950 --> 30:29.201
DIANE:
Oh, no, thank you.

30:29.260 --> 30:30.602
I'll just wait here.

30:33.130 --> 30:34.438
[clears throat quietly]

30:35.960 --> 30:37.348
Diane?
AllCla.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.345
I'm so sorry
to barge in like this.

30:39.400 --> 30:41.220
Oh, no, don't be sorry.

30:41.270 --> 30:42.919
I'm sure we can take a break
from Whatever we're d0ing.

30:42.970 --> 30:44.392
Oh, yes.

30:44.450 --> 30:46.054
There's a lot
of calls to return,

30:46.100 --> 30:48.967
but I'll hold them,
Mrs. Florrick.

30:49.020 --> 30:51.011
Thank you.

30:51.060 --> 30:52.231
Uh, first,
let me just say

30:52.280 --> 30:53.929
how impressed I was

30:53.980 --> 30:55.880
With the way you handled
the Smulders inheritance.

30:55.940 --> 30:58.022
Thank you.
You're welcome.

30:58.070 --> 30:59.844
We seem to have
an overload of cases

30:59.900 --> 31:02.414
and not enough associates
to handle them.

31:02.460 --> 31:04.894
The partners and I met, and, um,

31:04.950 --> 31:07.111
we would like to give
a few of them to you.

31:07.160 --> 31:09.037
Wow.

31:09.080 --> 31:10.638
Uh... thank you.

31:10.690 --> 31:11.770
They're not huge cases.

31:11.820 --> 31:13.037
I'm not a huge firm.

31:15.740 --> 31:17.958
How is it, being on your own?

31:18.000 --> 31:19.991
It's been a bit
of a struggle, but...

31:20.050 --> 31:22.132
actually not bad.

31:24.310 --> 31:26.961
Big firms aren't What
they used to be.

31:27.010 --> 31:28.056
Well, it sounds like
business is good.

31:28.100 --> 31:29.658
You have an overload of cases.

31:29.710 --> 31:31.484
Yes, I guess it is good.

31:32.800 --> 31:34.449
[doorbell rings]

31:34.500 --> 31:37.924
Diane, Will you excuse me
for a minute?

31:41.330 --> 31:44.504
[sighs] So, your guy
is a lying egomaniac.

31:44.550 --> 31:46.984
Do you trust him to get
through trial?

31:47.030 --> 31:48.247
No.

31:48.290 --> 31:50.463
Well, we can't put him
on the stand again.

31:50.510 --> 31:52.501
I don't need him
dragging my client down.

31:54.730 --> 31:56.994
Your strategy, the catch-22,

31:57.040 --> 32:00.214
are you always so creative
With the truth?

32:02.440 --> 32:05.079
I am when I've been pushed
to reject a one-year deal.

32:07.140 --> 32:09.005
I think we should sever
our cases.

32:09.050 --> 32:12.008
Separate trials,
separate juries.

32:12.060 --> 32:13.925
[scoffs]

32:13.970 --> 32:16.222
Yeah, sure.

32:16.280 --> 32:17.440
Great meeting. Thanks.

32:17.500 --> 32:19.104
Screw you.

32:28.030 --> 32:31.022
McGRATH: The state calls
Scott Pierre-Paul.

32:31.070 --> 32:32.719
Mr. Pierre-Paul, do you have
reason to believe Roland Hlavin

32:32.770 --> 32:34.294
knew he was making
a designer drug?

32:34.340 --> 32:35.989
Yeah, he knew.

32:36.040 --> 32:38.998
He marketed it as an
alternative to GHB.

32:39.040 --> 32:41.554
Said it was safer,
no adverse side effects.

32:41.610 --> 32:43.601
McGRATH: And did he ever
claim that his drugs

32:43.650 --> 32:45.129
were better than GHB?

32:45.180 --> 32:46.078
Yeah.

32:46.130 --> 32:47.347
Yeah, that was
the Whole point.

32:47.400 --> 32:49.004
His testimony
is gonna convict you.

32:49.050 --> 32:50.347
We need to come clean.

32:50.400 --> 32:51.389
About what?

32:51.440 --> 32:52.998
About you, Who you are.

32:53.050 --> 32:54.312
No.

32:54.360 --> 32:56.009
You think that the FBI
is gonna protect you

32:56.060 --> 32:58.051
if you don't give up
your identity, but they're not.

32:58.100 --> 32:59.408
You're supposed
to do What I want.

32:59.450 --> 33:01.270
No, I'm supposed to defend you.

33:01.320 --> 33:02.537
SCHAKOWSKY:
Mrs. Florrick,

33:02.580 --> 33:03.922
I realize this _
rather damning testimony

33:03.980 --> 33:05.277
is upsetting to both you
and your client,

33:05.330 --> 33:07.321
but could you please
hold it down?

33:10.160 --> 33:11.286
Your Honor, may...

33:11.330 --> 33:13.025
may we approach?
No.
By all means.

33:13.070 --> 33:14.412
It's not like we're
in the middle of anything.

33:14.470 --> 33:15.676
Wait!Young man, sit down!

33:15.730 --> 33:17.630
I've asked my lawyer
not to do this,

33:17.690 --> 33:19.419
Your Honor.What is she doing?

33:19.470 --> 33:21.779
I need to speak With my lavwer.

33:21.820 --> 33:24.072
Please, may we have a recess?

33:27.130 --> 33:29.041
[scoffs]

33:29.090 --> 33:31.046
Make it quick.

33:31.090 --> 33:32.216
[buzzer blaring]

33:32.270 --> 33:33.783
[door opens]

33:33.830 --> 33:36.651
Look, the reason I
lied to you before is

33:36.710 --> 33:38.746
because I am
an undercover FBI agent.

33:38.790 --> 33:41.748
And you are coming very
close to blowing my case.

33:41.800 --> 33:43.017
What case?

33:44.190 --> 33:46.408
I'm your defense attorney.

33:46.450 --> 33:48.054
You don't want me to defend you,

33:48.110 --> 33:49.065
then fire me.

33:49.110 --> 33:50.361
It's a sting.

33:51.630 --> 33:53.063
Of who, me?

33:53.110 --> 33:54.759
No. [chuckles]

33:54.810 --> 33:57.062
Then let me go to the judge
and brief him.

33:57.120 --> 33:59.076
No, the judge...

33:59.120 --> 34:00.599
is the target.

34:02.860 --> 34:04.589
Schakowslq?He will be offered a bribe

34:04.650 --> 34:06.993
to dismiss all charges
against me.

34:07.040 --> 34:09.645
If he does, he
Will be arrested.

34:09.690 --> 34:11.954
Does Lucca know?
Does the ASA...?

34:12.000 --> 34:14.343
No and no.
No one knows, not even the cops

34:14.400 --> 34:15.435
Who arrested me.

34:15.480 --> 34:17.038
You went to all this effort.

34:17.090 --> 34:18.614
The Bureau is cracking
down on corruption

34:18.660 --> 34:20.787
in state legislatures
and judiciaries.

34:20.840 --> 34:23.400
Now, we need you

34:23.450 --> 34:25.668
to go back in there
and continue this case.

34:25.710 --> 34:29.407
When the prosecution rests,
move for dismissal.

34:29.450 --> 34:31.008
On what grounds?You don't need grounds.

34:31.060 --> 34:33.108
Schakowslq will have
taken the bribe by then.

34:33.150 --> 34:34.754
He dismisses the case,

34:34.810 --> 34:36.675
we arrest him.

34:36.720 --> 34:38.893
Now, Alicia,

34:38.940 --> 34:40.805
you have no choice in this.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.071
Move for dismissal.

34:48.520 --> 34:50.511
[laughter]

34:51.820 --> 34:54.436
Any kids, Howard?

34:54.480 --> 34:55.640
No.

34:55.700 --> 34:56.598
I hated kids.

34:56.650 --> 35:00.006
[chuckles]

35:00.050 --> 35:01.483
You have a lovely laugh.

35:01.530 --> 35:03.486
Oh.

35:03.530 --> 35:05.964
My mother hated my laugh.

35:06.010 --> 35:08.274
She forced me to eat a garlic
clove every time I laughed.

35:08.320 --> 35:09.742
You're kidding.
No.

35:09.800 --> 35:11.529
You have a beautiful laugh.

35:11.580 --> 35:13.571
Refined.

35:13.630 --> 35:15.621
[chuckles]

35:17.940 --> 35:19.623
What's wrong?

35:20.810 --> 35:22.368
Nothing. It's...

35:22.420 --> 35:24.320
just been so long
since I've been happy.

35:24.380 --> 35:25.597
[chuckles]

35:25.640 --> 35:27.073
Hmm.

35:38.220 --> 35:40.211
[singing operatically]

35:45.660 --> 35:48.003
Hello, Alicia.

35:48.050 --> 35:51.668
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you
about this ageism suit.

35:54.230 --> 35:55.663
No, I think I changed my mind.

35:55.710 --> 35:56.881
I don't want to bring the suit.

35:58.240 --> 35:59.798
I just found out what's
going on with Howard.

35:59.850 --> 36:00.930
Why he's acting so weird.

36:00.980 --> 36:02.231
What is it?

36:02.290 --> 36:04.588
He's bringing an ageism suit
against us.

36:04.640 --> 36:05.800
For what? What have we done?

36:05.850 --> 36:06.930
I don't know.

36:06.990 --> 36:07.809
And you know Who's
helping him? Alicia.

36:07.860 --> 36:08.895
DIANE:
How do you know that?

36:08.940 --> 36:10.202
I heard him on
the phone with her.

36:10.250 --> 36:11.808
CARY:
You need to fire him.

36:11.860 --> 36:13.589
DAVID: You fire him, you give
him What he wants, a cause.

36:13.640 --> 36:15.198
CARY: No, we fire
him for cause.

36:15.260 --> 36:16.909
Next time he exposes
himself to a client.

36:16.950 --> 36:18.201
DAVID: My guess is,
Alicia advised him

36:18.260 --> 36:19.739
not to do anything stupid,

36:19.780 --> 36:21.168
and he's boned up
on all the cases

36:21.220 --> 36:22.175
in order to appear smart.

36:26.220 --> 36:28.176
[knocking]

36:31.970 --> 36:33.267
I checked With Landau.

36:33.320 --> 36:35.276
He has sources at the FBI.

36:35.320 --> 36:36.355
They're not after you.

36:36.410 --> 36:37.752
I know.

36:37.800 --> 36:39.142
[sighs]
Which means...

36:39.190 --> 36:41.146
they're after Peter.
I got to make a few calls.

36:41.190 --> 36:42.498
No, Eli, I was wrong.

36:42.540 --> 36:43.848
What do you mean?
It's not the FBI?

36:43.890 --> 36:45.369
No, it is. I...

36:45.420 --> 36:47.103
Then let me make_ a few calls.
If it's a sting,

36:47.160 --> 36:49.242
the more exposure they have,
the more they have to back off.

36:49.290 --> 36:51.190
Eli, you can't make those calls.

36:51.250 --> 36:52.729
Why not?Because it's not about me.

36:52.770 --> 36:55.238
It's about the judge,
Schakowslq.

36:55.300 --> 36:56.506
It's a bribery sting.

36:56.560 --> 36:58.243
They pulled
the exact same thing

36:58.300 --> 36:59.380
in Philadelphia
earlier this year.

36:59.430 --> 37:01.034
[knocking]

37:01.080 --> 37:03.219
[sighing]:
Excuse me.

37:08.870 --> 37:10.087
Diane, hi.

37:10.140 --> 37:11.209
Tell me something, Alicia.

37:11.270 --> 37:13.261
Are you always gonna be
looking for ways

37:13.310 --> 37:14.868
to get back at me?

37:14.920 --> 37:16.182
Excuse me?

37:16.230 --> 37:17.709
I thought we had
smoothed things over.

37:17.750 --> 37:19.923
I championed you
to the other partners.

37:19.970 --> 37:22.928
I got them to agree to
send you our overflow.

37:22.970 --> 37:25.109
You accepted my
generous offer,

37:25.150 --> 37:26.663
all the while actively
trying to betray me.

37:26.720 --> 37:28.278
Betray you?

37:28.330 --> 37:29.319
I don't...

37:29.370 --> 37:30.416
You're representing Howard.

37:30.460 --> 37:33.281
No, I'm not.

37:33.330 --> 37:34.672
You didn't give him advice
about bringing an ageism suit?

37:34.730 --> 37:37.290
[sighs heavily]

37:37.340 --> 37:39.069
That's privileged.

37:39.120 --> 37:42.078
You told him exactly
What he needed to do

37:42.120 --> 37:43.860
in order to sue us.

37:43.910 --> 37:46.219
Diane, this is not
What it seems.

37:46.260 --> 37:49.161
Actually, sometimes it is.

38:00.930 --> 38:02.409
CARY:
What is it about?

38:02.450 --> 38:03.530
DAVID: Howard?
I don't know, subpoenas maybe.

38:03.580 --> 38:04.660
What did Alicia say?Nothing.

38:04.710 --> 38:06.314
But she is advising him.

38:06.370 --> 38:07.405
Bitch.
Hey.

38:07.450 --> 38:08.792
What?

38:08.850 --> 38:09.976
So we tell him to take
emeritus status.

38:10.020 --> 38:11.237
We've already been
through that,

38:12.760 --> 38:14.022
so we do have cause.

38:14.070 --> 38:15.844
[grunts]

38:18.600 --> 38:20.158
Howard.

38:20.210 --> 38:21.336
You wanted to see us?

38:21.380 --> 38:22.597
Yeah.

38:22.640 --> 38:25.200
Uh, I just wanted to say,
uh, I brought in

38:25.250 --> 38:28.515
the Food Service Union.

38:33.610 --> 38:35.601
Excuse me?The Food Service Union.

38:35.660 --> 38:37.878
They were looking for
new legal representation,

38:37.920 --> 38:39.911
and I landed them.

38:39.960 --> 38:41.302
You convinced Ronnie Erickson?

38:41.360 --> 38:43.043
Oh, yeah, nice guy.

38:43.100 --> 38:44.226
Friend of a friend.

38:44.270 --> 38:46.659
$33 million in yearly billing.

38:46.710 --> 38:49.497
Just thought
you three should know.

38:53.330 --> 38:54.536
Uh...

38:54.590 --> 38:56.364
[door closes]

38:56.420 --> 38:58.365
[chuckles]

38:58.420 --> 38:59.671
[moans]

38:59.720 --> 39:01.768
I take it
they were impressed

39:01.810 --> 39:03.243
With my friend
Ronnie's business?

39:03.290 --> 39:05.599
Impressed?
They nearly wet themselves.

39:05.640 --> 39:07.335
[laughter]

39:07.380 --> 39:08.369
Oh, that laugh.

39:08.430 --> 39:09.681
Oh, my God.

39:12.780 --> 39:14.862
[laughing]
A nine iron?

39:14.910 --> 39:17.219
145 yards, pin high.

39:17.260 --> 39:18.386
I'll never do it again.

39:18.440 --> 39:19.657
[laughter]

39:19.700 --> 39:22.430
You should come
With me sometime.

39:22.490 --> 39:23.821
We'll take the wives.

39:23.880 --> 39:25.484
Deal.

39:25.530 --> 39:27.134
Speaking of Wives,
I have a favor, Don.

39:27.190 --> 39:28.703
Shoot
You've got a case.

39:28.750 --> 39:30.445
Roland Hlavin.

39:30.490 --> 39:32.185
He's Muriel's niece's kid.

39:32.230 --> 39:34.050
He got caught doing
something stupid.

39:34.110 --> 39:35.270
I'll say.

39:35.320 --> 39:36.924
But he's not a bad kid.

39:36.980 --> 39:38.015
Believe it or not,

39:38.070 --> 39:39.549
he was trying to do
something good.

39:39.590 --> 39:40.898
Keep people
from overdosing.

39:40.940 --> 39:41.895
Amway,

39:41.940 --> 39:43.931
if there's any way

39:43.990 --> 39:45.594
that you can dismiss his case,

39:45.640 --> 39:47.596
give him a slap
on the wrist.

39:47.640 --> 39:48.857
Jail would break him.

39:48.900 --> 39:51.949
[chuckles]
Let his Aunt Muriel have at him.

39:51.990 --> 39:53.548
I can make it
worth your while.

39:53.600 --> 39:55.295
I know your son's been looking
for a board seat

39:55.340 --> 39:56.420
over at PolyTech.

39:56.480 --> 39:58.425
I can make that happen.

40:03.660 --> 40:06.618
BAILIFF:
All rise.

40:10.530 --> 40:11.963
I understand the defense

40:12.010 --> 40:12.999
has a motion.

40:13.060 --> 40:14.925
We do, Your Honor.

40:14.970 --> 40:17.621
At this time, the defense moves
for a dismissal of all charges.

40:17.670 --> 40:19.399
On what grounds?

40:19.460 --> 40:23.328
The state's entire case
relies on the testimony

40:23.370 --> 40:25.418
of my client's
former codefendant.

40:25.460 --> 40:28.190
His most recent testimony

40:28.250 --> 40:30.946
directly contradicts
his earlier sworn statements.

40:30.990 --> 40:33.629
He's simply not credible.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.342
Your motion is denied,
Mrs. Florrick.

40:40.390 --> 40:41.823
This case will go to trial.

40:41.870 --> 40:43.861
Let's pick a date, shall we?

40:49.180 --> 40:50.909
You tipped him off.

40:50.970 --> 40:52.267
No, I didn't.

40:52.310 --> 40:53.789
Maybe he's just not corrupt.

40:53.840 --> 40:55.831
Have you ever
thought of that?

40:55.880 --> 40:57.529
This was a two-year
investigation, and we had him.

40:57.580 --> 40:58.797
Apparently not.

40:58.840 --> 41:01.013
Yeah, you're fired.

41:01.060 --> 41:03.449
Nice meeting you, sir.
Good luck.

41:18.560 --> 41:20.551
[crowd chattering, baby crying]

41:23.430 --> 41:24.988
SCHAKOWSKY:
Let's get started, people.

41:25.040 --> 41:26.029
Lot of cases backing up.

41:26.090 --> 41:27.307
Bar attorneys, let's go.

41:29.700 --> 41:32.168
Males 45-56,

41:32.220 --> 41:34.006
Mrs. Florrick.

41:35.010 --> 41:37.046
And...

41:37.100 --> 41:39.830
males 57-60 for you, Ms. Quinn.

41:41.320 --> 41:42.400
Your Honor...

41:42.450 --> 41:44.054
I don't have time
to discuss.

41:44.110 --> 41:47.147
Let's go.

41:55.070 --> 41:57.061
ALICIA:
Male 45?

41:57.120 --> 41:59.020
Oscar Massey, DUI.
Male 52.

41:59.080 --> 42:01.036
Carter Nicholas, exposed
yourself in public?

42:01.080 --> 42:02.809
I'm Alicia Florrick,
I'm a bar attorney

42:02.860 --> 42:04.509
made available to you

42:04.560 --> 42:06.118
by the Chicago Bar Association

42:06.170 --> 42:07.899
for your convenience.

42:07.960 --> 42:10.087
You're not required to hire me,
but if you don't...

42:10.130 --> 42:11.381
Thanks for doing that,

42:11.440 --> 42:13.044
warning me.

42:13.090 --> 42:15.479
I probably never would've
touched that bribe anyway,

42:15.530 --> 42:19.170
but I hate the way the FBI
turns friends against friends.

42:19.230 --> 42:20.572
It's terrible, isn't it?

42:20.620 --> 42:23.009
Yeah.

42:23.060 --> 42:24.277
Amway,

42:24.320 --> 42:26.015
I certainly owe you one.

42:26.060 --> 42:27.925
Good, because I need
a little help

42:27.980 --> 42:29.971
With Frank Landau.
