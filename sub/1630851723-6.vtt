WEBVTT

00:04.072 --> 00:05.439
I've lost the will.

00:07.208 --> 00:09.343
Performing at my level,

00:09.477 --> 00:11.445
there's absolutely
no room for error.

00:11.579 --> 00:15.015
It's just a lot of pressure,
you know?
Mmm-hmm.

00:15.149 --> 00:16.317
Too much.

00:16.450 --> 00:19.053
We've talked about
the adverse ways

00:19.187 --> 00:22.056
that pressure has manifested
in your life,

00:22.190 --> 00:25.059
but we've also discovered
helpful ways.

00:26.327 --> 00:30.631
Remember, behind every shadow,
there is a light.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.636
Your next performance is
this afternoon?

00:35.769 --> 00:37.171
Oh, my God.
I... I don't think I can.

00:37.305 --> 00:39.173
Oh, Randall, look at me.

00:39.307 --> 00:40.841
Randall.

00:40.974 --> 00:44.312
The time has come
for you to tell yourself
a different story.

00:44.445 --> 00:48.482
Embrace the shadow,
and you will find the light.

00:49.517 --> 00:54.222
Now, close your eyes
and visualize.

00:59.493 --> 01:01.162
You're on the way
to the venue.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.802
<i>You feel the music.</i>

01:13.807 --> 01:17.678
<i>Take a moment
and let it center you.</i>

01:17.811 --> 01:21.915
<i>It reminds you that you, too,
are a virtuoso.</i>

01:22.049 --> 01:26.287
<i>And, as you have
100 times before,</i>

01:26.420 --> 01:28.522
<i>you take out
your instrument...</i>

01:31.192 --> 01:33.594
And find the light.

01:58.018 --> 01:59.052
They know.

01:59.187 --> 02:00.921
Heber's just
covering his ass.

02:01.054 --> 02:02.656
Charlene vouched for me.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.492
She lied
to give me an alibi.

02:04.625 --> 02:05.926
Clearly,
he doesn't believe her.

02:06.059 --> 02:08.128
You're a cop.
Heber's a cop.

02:08.262 --> 02:09.763
All right, he just doesn't
wanna seem like

02:09.897 --> 02:11.131
he's playing favorites.

02:11.265 --> 02:12.500
That's all this is.

02:12.633 --> 02:13.901
He doesn't suspect you.

02:14.034 --> 02:16.069
He will when
the ballistics come back.

02:16.204 --> 02:17.371
Or haven't you
been listening?

02:17.505 --> 02:19.373
Heber was here an hour ago,

02:19.507 --> 02:20.974
with a warrant to test
my service weapon.

02:21.108 --> 02:22.710
When he does, he's gonna know
it was my gun

02:22.843 --> 02:24.578
that was used
to kill Doug Koster.

02:24.712 --> 02:27.381
Harold,
it's going to be fine.

02:27.515 --> 02:29.317
My wife had an affair
with Koster.

02:29.450 --> 02:30.918
Day after he's killed,

02:31.051 --> 02:32.353
Heber sees me
at the crime scene.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.087
My gun's the murder weapon.

02:34.222 --> 02:36.123
In what world does that
add up to "fine"?

02:36.257 --> 02:37.758
Is Pinky
still coming over?

02:37.891 --> 02:39.427
He sure is.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.462
All right, look,
I should get going.

02:41.595 --> 02:42.596
We'll talk later.

02:43.096 --> 02:44.031
Stop worrying.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.203
Well, hello, you.

02:49.337 --> 02:50.738
But when Pinky comes over,
we're gonna have to talk

02:50.871 --> 02:53.541
for a couple minutes,
then he's all yours.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.209
What're you gonna talk about?

02:55.343 --> 02:56.410
That's the thing
about Pinky.

02:56.544 --> 02:58.579
He always
keeps you guessing.

02:58.712 --> 03:00.848
I assume
this is on your radar.

03:01.282 --> 03:02.283
It is.

03:03.917 --> 03:06.287
Everyone's looking
for the congressman's
would-be assassin.

03:06.420 --> 03:07.988
Mmm. Naturally.

03:08.121 --> 03:10.157
But everyone is wrong.

03:10.291 --> 03:11.525
The congressman
wasn't the target.

03:11.659 --> 03:12.893
The victim was, Mary Parrot.

03:14.495 --> 03:16.297
An assassin's bullet
narrowly misses

03:16.430 --> 03:18.366
a controversial politician
because it was
actually aimed at

03:18.499 --> 03:20.200
a beloved philanthropist?

03:20.334 --> 03:22.002
Her philanthropy
was beloved.

03:22.135 --> 03:26.173
Her zeal for historical
preservation, not so much.

03:26.307 --> 03:29.910
She single-handedly
spiked dozens of
construction projects

03:30.043 --> 03:32.480
that she believed would
blight her fair city,

03:32.613 --> 03:36.584
denying powerful people
fortunes large
and even larger,

03:36.717 --> 03:39.253
including Vito Decanio.

03:40.354 --> 03:41.989
You think
the Decanio Crime Syndicate

03:42.122 --> 03:43.357
had Mary Parrot killed?

03:43.491 --> 03:45.359
I do.
So you're putting them
on the Blacklist.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.428
Criminals we already know exist.

03:47.561 --> 03:50.564
What you know
about the Decanios
is that they were weak,

03:50.698 --> 03:52.500
and now they're strong.

03:52.633 --> 03:55.603
What you don't know is why
or who is responsible

03:55.736 --> 03:58.205
for their dramatic resurgence.

03:58.339 --> 03:59.507
It's not the old man?

04:00.974 --> 04:02.676
His therapist, actually.

04:03.311 --> 04:05.513
Dr. Roberta Sand.

04:05.646 --> 04:07.715
Everyone in the organization
sees her.

04:07.848 --> 04:08.849
Vito's orders.

04:08.982 --> 04:10.050
A therapist.

04:10.183 --> 04:11.452
To the mob.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.253
Who makes the mob
more effective.

04:13.387 --> 04:15.456
Self-actualized.

04:15.589 --> 04:16.990
The shrink helps them

04:17.124 --> 04:19.293
fully realize their potential
as criminals.

04:19.427 --> 04:23.397
Listen, I'm a criminal,
and however realized I may be

04:23.531 --> 04:27.034
is due in large part
to shrinks and shamans,

04:27.167 --> 04:28.902
rabbis and monks.

04:29.036 --> 04:32.906
They hold me together
like a psychological bandage,

04:33.040 --> 04:36.710
without which my sufferings
would be insufferable.

04:38.579 --> 04:40.881
You told me
that if you came back,

04:41.014 --> 04:44.251
names would be taken,
a price would be paid.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.987
But you didn't tell me
what names or why.

04:48.155 --> 04:50.057
I don't know the names,

04:50.190 --> 04:52.726
and without them,
I don't know the why.

04:53.594 --> 04:54.728
Are you don't talking yet?

04:56.163 --> 04:57.898
We are.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.033
Which means it's time for me
to get to the office

05:00.167 --> 05:02.636
and for you two
to have fun.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.372
Mooms is upstairs.

05:04.505 --> 05:07.408
If you or Pinky get hungry,
she can make you something.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.444
Oh, now what's that?

05:10.578 --> 05:12.713
I'll play anything
but gin again.

05:12.846 --> 05:15.248
At least until
I read up on it a little.

05:15.383 --> 05:18.018
You're too good,
and I was hopeless.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.252
It's not gin.

05:19.387 --> 05:20.954
It's a memory game.

05:21.088 --> 05:22.322
Matching U.S. states
and their capitals.

05:22.456 --> 05:24.492
Oh, my. Okay.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.360
Let's do it.
I'm ready.

05:26.494 --> 05:29.663
Although, I don't think
I'll fare any better
than I did in gin.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.565
Well, at least this time,
you have an excuse.

05:31.699 --> 05:32.666
What?

05:32.800 --> 05:34.968
I'm fine.
My memory is fine.

05:35.102 --> 05:36.103
Sort of.

05:36.236 --> 05:37.838
I'm older,
not ancient.

05:37.971 --> 05:39.673
Well, I didn't mean that.

05:39.807 --> 05:40.841
I mean you won't know
the capitals

05:40.974 --> 05:41.942
because you're not
from here.

05:42.075 --> 05:44.177
I wouldn't know the capitals
of Russia.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.080
Okay.
Here's how you play.

05:48.849 --> 05:51.685
Vito Decanio was
a relic of the past.

05:51.819 --> 05:52.853
A lion in winter.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.955
Until, according to
Reddington,

05:55.088 --> 05:57.958
he hired a therapist
who goes by
Dr. Roberta Sand.

05:58.091 --> 06:00.628
He's convinced the Decanio
family's recent rise

06:00.761 --> 06:02.630
is her doing.
That won't last long.

06:02.763 --> 06:05.566
A witness is in
federal custody who's
going to testify tomorrow

06:05.699 --> 06:07.601
that Decanio himself
ordered

06:07.735 --> 06:09.002
three separate hits
on his rivals.

06:09.136 --> 06:10.804
I've been to therapy
since I was 10.

06:10.938 --> 06:13.073
I've never heard of a shrink
who tries to help people
get worse.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.442
Ten.

06:14.575 --> 06:15.976
I was, um, having a hard time
with differential calculus.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.645
You learned calculus at 10?

06:17.778 --> 06:18.946
Well, I learned it at eight.

06:19.079 --> 06:21.515
I taught it at 10.
Or, uh, tried to.

06:21.649 --> 06:23.116
My parents just couldn't
grasp the concepts.

06:23.250 --> 06:25.719
It was an incredibly
frustrating time for everyone.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.387
I'm not sure I believe
a therapist should be

06:27.521 --> 06:29.957
held responsible
for Decanio's upswing,

06:30.090 --> 06:32.025
but according to Reddington,
Decanio thinks she is.

06:32.159 --> 06:34.327
<i>That makes her
very valuable to us.</i>

06:34.462 --> 06:37.230
Vito tells me he has
a project for you.

06:37.364 --> 06:40.668
He says it requires teamwork
and cooperation.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.836
But he says you'd rather
piss on each other

06:42.970 --> 06:44.838
and say that it's raining.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.609
So...
Any thoughts?

06:53.380 --> 06:54.214
<i>Do we know
anything about her?</i>

06:54.347 --> 06:55.583
Nothing.

06:55.716 --> 06:57.184
No photos, no prints,

06:57.317 --> 06:59.252
and a search on her alias
went nowhere.

06:59.386 --> 07:00.754
If we have no leads,
where should we start?

07:01.989 --> 07:03.223
Mary Parrot.

07:03.356 --> 07:05.693
Reddington says she isn't
the unfortunate victim

07:05.826 --> 07:07.761
of a bullet meant for
a politician.

07:07.895 --> 07:10.097
He says that she was
a preservationist

07:10.230 --> 07:12.065
who sidetracked a number
of lucrative developments

07:12.199 --> 07:13.567
Decanio stood to
benefit from.

07:13.701 --> 07:14.868
So, he had her killed.

07:15.002 --> 07:16.236
Maybe.

07:16.369 --> 07:19.707
And maybe her killer was
under the good doctor's care.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.875
Find him,
and maybe we find her.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.147
Park asked
if he could come.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.048
How are they doing?

07:29.316 --> 07:30.784
Not great.

07:30.918 --> 07:32.853
She thought him seeing
where she works might help.

07:32.986 --> 07:33.987
You want me
to bring him to her?

07:34.121 --> 07:35.556
No, I'll do it.

07:35.689 --> 07:38.091
We're a little short-handed
since Ressler's taking
a personal day.

07:38.225 --> 07:40.360
You two stay focused on
finding Mary Parrot's killer.

07:54.542 --> 07:55.543
Hey.

07:56.343 --> 07:58.478
I'm glad you're here.

07:58.612 --> 08:01.081
Are the episodes getting
any better?

08:01.214 --> 08:03.316
If by better, you mean
it feels like I'm being

08:03.450 --> 08:05.252
stabbed in the eyes
with a fork
instead of a knife,

08:05.385 --> 08:06.954
then sure.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.123
The quiet helps.

08:10.257 --> 08:13.961
And caffeine. Anyway, uh,
it's all passed now.

08:14.094 --> 08:15.295
Come on.
Let me give you a tour.

08:15.428 --> 08:16.597
I don't need a tour.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.334
You wanting me to come
is enough.

08:23.737 --> 08:26.106
What I do is secret.

08:26.239 --> 08:27.440
That I do it
shouldn't be.

08:28.742 --> 08:29.943
Not from you.

08:31.579 --> 08:33.246
I'm sorry
I didn't tell you.

08:35.048 --> 08:37.050
I've been reading
medical journals,

08:37.184 --> 08:40.788
researching everything I can
to find out what happened.

08:40.921 --> 08:43.323
Whether we lost the baby
because of my job,

08:44.291 --> 08:46.226
the directed-energy weapon...

08:47.995 --> 08:50.263
I know you want to know
the reason.

08:50.397 --> 08:51.965
I'm sorry you don't.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.669
Man, I just keep saying sorry,
don't I?

08:55.803 --> 08:57.137
It's fine.

08:57.270 --> 08:58.538
I mean,
if I'm being honest,

08:58.672 --> 09:00.974
you kind of have
a lot to apologize for.

09:02.442 --> 09:03.611
But so do I.

09:05.646 --> 09:08.081
I don't want to believe

09:08.215 --> 09:10.884
I married someone
who can hide everything,

09:12.185 --> 09:14.054
but I think I did,

09:14.187 --> 09:16.389
and that's what
I'm sorriest about,

09:16.523 --> 09:19.893
that I married someone
I just don't know...

09:21.494 --> 09:22.830
If I know.

09:28.702 --> 09:30.938
Hey. Cooper updated me while
you were at the crime scene.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.205
Find anything?

09:32.339 --> 09:34.708
Okay, so NYPD is nowhere
on the shooter.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.677
Was it a passerby,
someone in a vehicle,
a building?

09:36.810 --> 09:38.045
They don't know.

09:38.178 --> 09:40.080
So, we read the eyewitness
statements and M.E. reports.

09:40.213 --> 09:42.382
From that, we got this.

09:44.117 --> 09:45.719
All right,
the victim was here.

09:45.853 --> 09:47.120
Now, based on
the entry wound,

09:47.254 --> 09:48.355
the shooter was somewhere
to the east.

09:48.488 --> 09:50.523
NYPD canvassed
the most likely building

09:50.658 --> 09:52.559
based on
the assumed trajectory,

09:52.693 --> 09:54.594
which would put the shooter
on this rooftop.

09:54.728 --> 09:57.397
Only they didn't
find the shooter
or any evidence of him.

09:57.530 --> 10:00.668
So, I think the shooter
was here.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.602
Same angle,
just farther back.

10:02.736 --> 10:04.772
He fires, the bullet goes
over the rooftop

10:04.905 --> 10:06.674
of the lower building,
across the street,

10:06.807 --> 10:10.110
and between the flagpoles
and obstructions,
and into the victim.

10:10.243 --> 10:11.544
That building isn't
further back.

10:11.679 --> 10:12.846
It's, like,
in another county.

10:12.980 --> 10:15.348
Who can make
a shot like that?
I could.

10:15.482 --> 10:17.751
I'll pull CCTV footage
from around that building

10:17.885 --> 10:20.053
at the time of the shooting,
see if we can ID anyone.

10:20.854 --> 10:21.789
Vermont.

10:21.922 --> 10:22.923
Montpelier.

10:24.357 --> 10:25.993
Kentucky.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.061
Frankfort.

10:28.595 --> 10:29.396
Carson City.

10:29.529 --> 10:30.530
Nevada.

10:32.165 --> 10:34.267
Okay, maybe I am ancient.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.236
Well, I told you,
you have an excuse.

10:37.370 --> 10:39.439
Yes, thank goodness.

10:39.572 --> 10:41.074
When did you stop
being Russian?

10:42.475 --> 10:44.311
That's a funny question.

10:45.612 --> 10:46.714
How did you know
I was Russian?

10:47.681 --> 10:49.449
My mother told me.

10:49.582 --> 10:51.985
She told me everything I would
ever need to know about you.

10:52.953 --> 10:54.888
She must've said a lot.

10:55.288 --> 10:56.824
She did.

10:56.957 --> 10:59.459
But at the end of it,

10:59.592 --> 11:01.729
she said all I needed to
remember was that

11:01.862 --> 11:05.198
Raymond Reddington was
the most important person
in her life,

11:05.332 --> 11:09.102
besides me, and she was glad
that I had met you,

11:09.236 --> 11:11.104
and she wished that
we could meet again.

11:12.973 --> 11:14.975
I am really glad we did.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.782
She said you liked
to hold hands.

11:26.453 --> 11:28.188
I'm starved.

11:30.457 --> 11:33.593
You want to go see if Mooms
wants to eat with us?

11:33.727 --> 11:34.762
Okay.

11:49.242 --> 11:51.511
Dino, I need you to focus.

11:51.644 --> 11:53.346
We can't do this work
without you.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.482
Yeah. It'd be nice if
he worked on something.

11:55.615 --> 11:57.785
I'm the brains
of the operation,

11:57.918 --> 11:59.519
and everybody knows it.

11:59.652 --> 12:01.654
Last I checked, you couldn't
tell a socket wrench
from your elbow.

12:01.789 --> 12:03.957
Yeah, maybe that's 'cause
I don't have to.

12:04.091 --> 12:06.059
'Cause I'm not a drudge,
like you.

12:06.193 --> 12:06.927
You think
you're better than us?

12:07.060 --> 12:08.228
I know
I'm better than you.

12:08.361 --> 12:10.330
Say that again!
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

12:10.463 --> 12:12.365
I have a question
for the three of you.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.936
What are you getting
out of all this anger?

12:16.069 --> 12:17.704
He's gonna get
his nose broken.
Ha.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.372
And then what?

12:19.506 --> 12:21.741
I mean, you have
a big project coming up

12:21.875 --> 12:23.710
that requires teamwork.

12:23.844 --> 12:25.378
Do you think punching him
in the face

12:25.512 --> 12:26.880
is gonna
make that happen?

12:27.014 --> 12:28.648
No.
It's definitely not.

12:28.782 --> 12:29.950
Exactly.

12:30.083 --> 12:33.286
Now, everyone has
a path in life,

12:33.420 --> 12:36.389
and the path
you're on, well,

12:36.523 --> 12:39.960
most people would say
that it's the wrong one,

12:40.093 --> 12:42.863
but what a man can be,
he must be.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.533
So, to be clear,
I'm not here to tell you

12:46.666 --> 12:49.202
to stop being angry
or to judge you.

12:49.336 --> 12:51.204
No.
My goal is to help you

12:51.338 --> 12:54.374
stop judging yourselves
and each other.

12:56.043 --> 12:57.510
This is the roof
from which the sniper

12:57.644 --> 12:59.512
shot and killed
Mary Parrot,

12:59.646 --> 13:01.648
and only three minutes
after the murder,

13:01.781 --> 13:04.551
who walks out the building,
but everyone's favorite
noir stereotype,

13:04.684 --> 13:05.919
Mr. Instrument Case.

13:06.053 --> 13:07.720
Now, we have no ID
on the sniper,

13:07.855 --> 13:11.758
but on the plus side,
we happen to have
a sniper on the payroll.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.927
Shooting from that distance
is extremely difficult

13:14.061 --> 13:15.362
and takes a great deal
of practice.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.230
And when he says
"from that distance,"

13:17.364 --> 13:19.299
he means anywhere from
500 yards to, say,

13:19.432 --> 13:20.868
I don't know, Kansas.

13:21.001 --> 13:23.070
Of the gun ranges
in that area,
there's only one

13:23.203 --> 13:24.804
with lanes longer than
300 yards.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.673
And guess who's a member
in good standing.

13:34.714 --> 13:37.450
As I live and breathe.
It is good to see you.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.686
Hey, Jean.
This is my friend Stacy.

13:39.819 --> 13:40.820
Nice to meet you.

13:42.555 --> 13:44.224
So, you gonna tell me
what's going on?

13:44.357 --> 13:45.392
About a week back,
Red comes out here

13:45.525 --> 13:47.060
with this little,
itty-bitty Latinx-er,

13:47.194 --> 13:49.262
acting like
she's the new you.

13:49.396 --> 13:51.398
And I appreciate your concern,
but I'm fine.

13:51.531 --> 13:53.901
Raymond and I,
we had a good run.

13:54.034 --> 13:55.268
So, what're you doing
for an encore, then?

13:55.402 --> 13:57.170
I joined the FBI.

13:58.405 --> 14:00.073
I hired him,

14:00.207 --> 14:02.575
for a job that needs
a pro's pro.

14:02.709 --> 14:04.377
Given what's required,

14:04.511 --> 14:05.845
I'm told we should be
asking for this man.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.347
Hmm. Beasley.

14:08.148 --> 14:09.349
He's a hell of a shot.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.284
Any chance
you have his address?

14:33.840 --> 14:34.841
Get down!

15:01.768 --> 15:02.735
Got you.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.045
Randall Beasley.

15:12.179 --> 15:13.413
You're under arrest.

15:35.235 --> 15:37.370
I don't understand.

15:37.504 --> 15:40.240
I thought you were having
such a fun time with Agnes.

15:49.916 --> 15:51.218
What is that?

15:53.886 --> 15:55.388
A piece of the past.

15:57.324 --> 15:59.392
The answers are here,

15:59.526 --> 16:01.394
in a letter
she wrote to you.

16:05.565 --> 16:07.600
Why do you have a letter
my mother wrote to me?

16:07.734 --> 16:09.936
For when
the time was right,

16:10.070 --> 16:11.404
to let you know the truth.

16:19.746 --> 16:21.581
What are you gonna
do with it?

16:21.714 --> 16:23.450
Cvetko is meeting us
at the jet.

16:23.583 --> 16:27.020
I'm hoping he can tell me
about its more recent history.

16:31.658 --> 16:32.425
Like what?

16:34.094 --> 16:35.428
I hate to think.

16:39.266 --> 16:41.334
We've gone through
everything we found
at Beasley's house.

16:41.468 --> 16:42.935
Cache of weapons,
letters from his mom

16:43.070 --> 16:46.439
who thinks he's a PE teacher,
and this.

16:46.573 --> 16:48.441
Eleven appointments just
this month for dog grooming.

16:49.442 --> 16:50.843
So, he's a dog person.

16:50.977 --> 16:52.445
That's the thing.
There's no evidence
he had one.

16:52.579 --> 16:53.980
And if that is
not curious enough,

16:54.114 --> 16:55.482
each appointment
is scheduled

16:55.615 --> 16:57.150
to take place
at a different address.

16:57.284 --> 16:58.985
Well, intersections,
actually.

16:59.119 --> 17:02.055
Second Avenue and 16th Street
on Tuesday the 30th,

17:02.189 --> 17:05.024
then Friday the 3rd on 63rd
and Central Park West.

17:05.158 --> 17:07.360
None of which correspond to
a pet store or groomer.

17:07.494 --> 17:09.462
So, it's a code.
For what?

17:09.596 --> 17:11.798
We don't know the what.
Just the how.

17:11.931 --> 17:14.367
Beasley would send a text
requesting an appointment,

17:14.501 --> 17:16.236
then get one back
with a location,

17:16.369 --> 17:19.038
and this location
is just a few blocks

17:19.172 --> 17:20.807
from where Mary Parrot
was killed,

17:20.940 --> 17:23.610
and the date and time is
an hour before he killed her.

17:23.743 --> 17:26.012
This is definitely evidence
of something.

17:26.146 --> 17:27.814
You need to get him
to tell us what.

17:31.984 --> 17:33.086
Hey, Lew.

17:34.921 --> 17:36.289
Now?

17:36.423 --> 17:37.890
I'm in the middle of a c...

17:39.459 --> 17:40.960
You got a ballistics report?

17:42.529 --> 17:44.264
Yeah.
Tell me where and when.

17:45.965 --> 17:48.901
The dog grooming,
tell us about it.

17:49.035 --> 17:51.504
I got a Lhasa apso.
Her hair knots.

17:52.205 --> 17:53.306
We know it's a code.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.507
Then what do you
need me for?

17:54.641 --> 17:56.576
You murdered
an innocent woman.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.545
And yet, here you are,
as calm as can be.

17:59.979 --> 18:01.214
And we know why.

18:01.748 --> 18:02.915
Therapy.

18:03.049 --> 18:04.451
A twisted version
of counseling

18:04.584 --> 18:07.086
to make you feel good
about being bad.

18:07.220 --> 18:09.055
And exhale.

18:12.159 --> 18:13.393
Now, how does that feel?

18:13.526 --> 18:16.229
Honestly? Better.

18:16.363 --> 18:17.397
Eh, kind of like
our hearts

18:17.530 --> 18:19.732
started beating
at the same time.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.834
That's what these are, right?

18:22.869 --> 18:23.603
Therapy appointments?

18:24.837 --> 18:26.038
I'm not talking
about that.

18:26.173 --> 18:28.141
Eleven appointments
in three weeks.

18:28.275 --> 18:31.911
That is almost
one every other day.

18:33.213 --> 18:34.447
Why so many?

18:35.782 --> 18:37.417
Because that's how long
it took Dr. Sand

18:37.550 --> 18:39.552
to convince you
it was okay to kill.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.289
That's what she did,
isn't it?

18:42.422 --> 18:44.491
Make you feel okay
about murder.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.659
Dino?
Uh, there's no wrong answers,

18:46.793 --> 18:48.495
as long as you're honest
about how you feel.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.830
I, uh... I feel all right.

18:53.266 --> 18:55.302
Look, I'm not saying I'm happy
about Johnny threatening me,

18:55.435 --> 18:57.270
but I, uh... I get it.

18:57.404 --> 19:00.607
We need to swallow our pride
for the good of the team.

19:01.274 --> 19:02.275
Johnny?

19:03.410 --> 19:04.277
What?
You want me to be honest?

19:04.411 --> 19:05.478
Absolutely.

19:05.612 --> 19:07.280
This doesn't work
unless you are.

19:07.414 --> 19:09.716
Okay, then.
Uh, honestly?

19:09.849 --> 19:11.718
I feel like I'm on an episode
of <i>Dr. Phil.</i>

19:11.851 --> 19:12.985
Hey.

19:13.119 --> 19:14.321
<i>As bad as
we know you are,</i>

19:14.454 --> 19:17.590
we think Dr. Sand is worse.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.860
Help us,
and we'll help you.

19:20.993 --> 19:23.430
The codes
are appointments.

19:24.731 --> 19:26.065
Show us how it works.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.470
I understand how it feels
to have guilt

19:30.603 --> 19:31.838
about things
you've done in the past.

19:35.442 --> 19:37.210
You know what you did
was wrong.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.681
Show us you know.

19:45.552 --> 19:46.519
Johnny's not ready.

19:46.653 --> 19:47.887
It's a three-man job.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.022
One that you said requires
complete trust.

19:50.156 --> 19:51.491
Johnny doesn't have it.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.360
Maybe if I had
more time with him...

19:53.493 --> 19:54.761
No, that's not an option.

19:54.894 --> 19:57.630
Then my advice is
you find someone else.

19:59.466 --> 20:00.633
Well, what about Dante?

20:03.102 --> 20:04.136
You know
the answer to that.

20:04.271 --> 20:05.805
Well, you said
we needed somebody...

20:05.938 --> 20:07.674
I did.
But not him.

20:08.441 --> 20:10.443
It's an important job.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.479
We have an understanding.

20:12.612 --> 20:14.647
If it goes well,
he can write his own ticket.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.421
Look, you're the best
at what you do,

20:21.554 --> 20:25.224
which is making people
feel good about themselves.

20:25.358 --> 20:28.060
At what I do,
I'm the best.

20:28.194 --> 20:31.163
And making people feel good
has nothing to do with it.

20:32.332 --> 20:34.000
Are you threatening me?

20:34.133 --> 20:35.868
After everything
that I've done for you?

20:36.002 --> 20:37.770
Oh, first of all,

20:37.904 --> 20:40.373
we both know
who you do it for,
and it sure ain't me.

20:40.507 --> 20:43.676
And secondly, yeah,
I'm threatening you.

20:44.444 --> 20:45.678
That's what I do.

20:46.613 --> 20:48.247
Dante's in.

20:48.381 --> 20:50.750
You got a problem with that,
see a shrink.

21:12.805 --> 21:13.940
Is that...

21:14.073 --> 21:15.908
Wait, it's really
dog-grooming appointments?

21:16.042 --> 21:17.510
I don't know
if the president's dog's
in there

21:17.644 --> 21:18.845
getting a trim of what,

21:18.978 --> 21:20.813
but Jazz Paws is tricked out
with armored panels

21:20.947 --> 21:22.749
and a GPS jammer.
Let's move.

21:30.357 --> 21:31.924
FBI!

21:32.058 --> 21:33.393
Exit the vehicle now!

21:49.275 --> 21:51.444
I don't understand.

21:51.578 --> 21:53.446
This says my gun
wasn't the murder weapon.

21:54.614 --> 21:55.682
Imagine that.

21:55.815 --> 21:58.751
I can't,
because it was. We...

21:58.885 --> 22:00.887
We ran the ballistics.
We know the truth.

22:01.020 --> 22:03.756
Yeah, but they don't,
and they never will.

22:05.224 --> 22:06.426
Lew.

22:07.627 --> 22:08.928
What did you do?

22:09.061 --> 22:11.263
Nothing that you wouldn't do
if I asked you.

22:11.398 --> 22:12.465
But I didn't ask.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.568
I performed a little magic
on the bore.

22:15.702 --> 22:17.069
That's all
you need to know,

22:17.203 --> 22:19.138
and it's more than
Heber ever will.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.842
It's one lie
built on another.

22:22.975 --> 22:24.977
First I rope in Charlene,
now you.

22:25.111 --> 22:27.313
You didn't rope me in,
all right?

22:27.447 --> 22:28.715
I did it because I know you,

22:28.848 --> 22:30.349
and I know you didn't kill
Doug Koster.

22:30.483 --> 22:31.584
You don't know that.

22:31.718 --> 22:34.253
<i>I</i> don't know that.

22:34.387 --> 22:37.123
I hated that man because of
what he did to my marriage.

22:37.256 --> 22:39.225
At my worst, who knows
what I could have done?

22:40.092 --> 22:41.828
What I know

22:41.961 --> 22:44.130
is that innocent people
get convicted all the time.

22:44.263 --> 22:46.699
And I wasn't about to let that
happen to you.

22:46.833 --> 22:49.602
You feel guilty, like you're
getting away with murder,

22:49.736 --> 22:52.605
but you're not,
because you're not a murderer.

22:54.974 --> 22:57.343
Someone killed Koster.
Yeah, that's right.

22:57.477 --> 22:58.578
And then they framed you.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.212
And now that
you're in the clear,

23:00.346 --> 23:02.815
it's time to find out
who did that and why.

23:05.985 --> 23:07.386
It doesn't feel like
I'm in the clear.

23:08.655 --> 23:11.824
Yeah. I guess that's why
you haven't thanked me.

23:16.663 --> 23:18.531
How'd it work?

23:18.665 --> 23:21.333
You roll up in a van,
dig up some
deep-seated trauma,

23:22.502 --> 23:24.403
figure out how to exploit it,
then what?

23:24.537 --> 23:27.540
Send your client off
to commit the perfect crime?

23:27.674 --> 23:30.610
Anything I did or didn't say
to my clients is privileged.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.144
Not if you didn't
report a crime

23:32.278 --> 23:34.246
you knew they were
going to commit

23:34.380 --> 23:37.016
or made them comfortable
committing it.

23:37.149 --> 23:40.553
I help my clients
be comfortable
in their own skin.

23:40.687 --> 23:42.622
Comfortable?
Committing crimes?

23:42.755 --> 23:44.691
Giving in
to their darkest impulses?

23:44.824 --> 23:47.860
Everyone has dark impulses,
Agent Park.

23:47.994 --> 23:48.861
Even you.

23:50.897 --> 23:53.399
Yeah, ones that,
like any normal person,

23:53.533 --> 23:55.034
I hate about myself

23:55.167 --> 23:57.870
and that I'd hope a therapist
would cure me of.

23:58.004 --> 23:59.939
Cure you? Of what?

24:00.072 --> 24:03.075
Uh, being who you are?

24:03.209 --> 24:05.878
Why would you possibly want
anyone to cure you of that?

24:09.381 --> 24:13.920
Once I was dead and gone,
I wanted Elizabeth
to know everything.

24:14.053 --> 24:18.891
So, I gave Dembe
the letter with
very specific instructions.

24:20.727 --> 24:22.595
Only when I'm gone.

24:22.729 --> 24:24.897
Give it to Elizabeth,
but only when I'm gone.

24:28.968 --> 24:31.604
Later that night,
Elizabeth was shot and killed.

24:32.204 --> 24:33.405
Okay.

24:34.674 --> 24:35.875
But what does that
have to do

24:36.008 --> 24:37.476
with whatever happened
with Agnes?

24:37.610 --> 24:42.515
I think she said her mother
told her about those things.

24:42.649 --> 24:46.418
Elizabeth would never
have told her
unless she'd read the letter.

24:47.554 --> 24:48.688
Am I interrupting?

24:48.821 --> 24:50.990
Ah!
Vlad, please, come sit.

24:52.191 --> 24:53.826
Ah, good to
see you again.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.427
Ah, great to see you.

24:55.562 --> 24:58.030
Uh, Weecha, you're in
the presence of greatness.

24:58.164 --> 25:02.501
Vlad's one of the world's
foremost forensic analysts.

25:02.635 --> 25:05.772
I have a, uh, finger
in a drawer at home.

25:05.905 --> 25:09.075
Would you be able to
tell me who it belongs to?

25:09.208 --> 25:12.344
Would be easier if you had
a... A head in a box.

25:13.780 --> 25:15.982
If you can
identify the finger, I will.

25:18.618 --> 25:20.953
Eh, is that why
you wanted to see me?

25:21.087 --> 25:25.324
No, although I'm always
intrigued by streams crossing.

25:25.457 --> 25:30.396
So, we'll get you the finger,
but first, this envelope.

25:32.098 --> 25:33.232
I need you to tell me

25:33.365 --> 25:36.368
if Elizabeth Keen's
fingerprints are on it.

25:37.069 --> 25:38.537
That's it?

25:38.671 --> 25:41.273
That's all you need?
Besides the finger?

25:41.407 --> 25:42.775
Yes.

25:42.909 --> 25:44.877
I've had a copy of her prints
sent to you.

25:45.578 --> 25:47.246
Consider it done.

25:47.379 --> 25:51.150
Out of curiosity, what answer
you are hoping for?

25:51.283 --> 25:52.985
That her prints
aren't there.

25:53.452 --> 25:54.553
That I'm...

25:55.688 --> 25:57.156
Imagining things.

25:59.091 --> 26:01.728
Sir, we ran her prints.

26:01.861 --> 26:03.930
Dr. Sand.
Her name is Eleanor Russo.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.732
She used to be
in private practice,

26:05.865 --> 26:09.001
kept up with her licensing,
until she fell off the grid
five years ago.

26:09.135 --> 26:10.302
Any idea why?
A theory, yeah.

26:10.436 --> 26:12.071
Him.

26:12.204 --> 26:13.405
Decanio's body man?

26:13.539 --> 26:15.207
Who also happens to be
her son.

26:15.341 --> 26:16.542
What did Sand say
about it?

26:16.676 --> 26:18.410
She hasn't yet.
We're about to find out now.

26:21.213 --> 26:23.349
I already told the other two

26:23.482 --> 26:26.919
I won't violate
doctor-patient privilege.

26:27.053 --> 26:28.721
I don't want to talk
about your patients.

26:28.855 --> 26:30.422
To them, you're Dr. Sand.

26:31.758 --> 26:33.926
It's Eleanor Russo
I'm interested in.

26:36.095 --> 26:41.367
Eleanor and her son, Dante.

26:41.500 --> 26:44.871
UCLA medical school,
a thriving practice
in Philadelphia,

26:45.004 --> 26:47.606
then five years ago,
you vanish.

26:47.740 --> 26:50.209
People like you
don't vanish.

26:50.342 --> 26:52.044
Not without a good reason.

26:53.512 --> 26:55.047
Is Dante your reason?

27:00.352 --> 27:03.756
I vanished because
my marriage fell apart.

27:05.057 --> 27:08.060
Because we fought over Dante,

27:08.194 --> 27:12.198
and the more we fought,
the worse he got.

27:12.331 --> 27:15.401
Cutting school,
hanging out with bad people

27:15.534 --> 27:17.069
who introduced him
to worse people.

27:17.203 --> 27:18.170
Vito Decanio.

27:18.304 --> 27:19.839
Yeah, eventually.

27:19.972 --> 27:24.576
But not until after he'd
committed a number of crimes.

27:25.912 --> 27:28.547
Enough to get him arrested.

27:30.116 --> 27:33.585
And that's when
Vito stepped in

27:33.720 --> 27:34.754
to help keep him
out of prison.

27:34.887 --> 27:36.989
If you agreed to help him.

27:37.123 --> 27:39.291
He said if I'd counsel
his people,

27:39.425 --> 27:41.460
he'd keep Dante
out of harm's way.

27:43.796 --> 27:45.464
Today, he broke that deal.

27:47.199 --> 27:50.202
If I help you,
will you protect him?

27:50.336 --> 27:52.805
I promise to try
to protect you both,

27:52.939 --> 27:56.442
but I'm unable to do that
unless you tell me
where Dante is.

27:56.575 --> 27:57.944
<i>We demo and snatch,
you drive.</i>

27:58.077 --> 27:59.846
It's teamwork, just like
the doctor ordered.

27:59.979 --> 28:01.413
As in Dr. Sand?

28:01.547 --> 28:02.782
Yeah.
You seeing her, too?

28:02.915 --> 28:04.951
Me? No.
I tried therapy.

28:05.084 --> 28:07.519
Had issues with my mom.
It didn't take.

28:07.653 --> 28:09.889
Yeah, well,
like Dr. Sand says,

28:10.022 --> 28:11.690
growth only happens
if you're open to it.

28:11.824 --> 28:12.591
Maybe you weren't open.

28:12.725 --> 28:14.526
Yeah. Maybe.

28:14.660 --> 28:16.428
Hey, what time does
the construction crew arrive?

28:16.562 --> 28:17.864
Whenever Vito tells them.

28:17.997 --> 28:19.431
That he controls.

28:19.565 --> 28:21.333
Wildcard was
the preservationist.

28:21.467 --> 28:23.135
She wanted to
shut us down.

28:23.269 --> 28:24.636
<i>Would've made this whole
snatch-and-grab impossible.</i>

28:24.771 --> 28:25.504
There you go.

28:28.841 --> 28:30.777
You do know this is
a protection detail,

28:30.910 --> 28:32.979
not a rehearsal for
The World Series of Poker.

28:33.112 --> 28:35.848
<i>So, this Herman guy,
what's he testifying about?</i>

28:35.982 --> 28:37.516
He's not gonna
be testifying.

28:37.649 --> 28:38.918
He's gonna be crying
for his own mama

28:39.051 --> 28:40.519
whenever Vito
gets a hold of him.

28:40.652 --> 28:42.154
Now, get back to the car.

28:48.694 --> 28:51.530
Couldn't it be
a good thing?

28:51.663 --> 28:53.665
That Liz knew the truth
before she died?

28:55.534 --> 28:56.735
No.

28:57.369 --> 28:59.405
Why not?

28:59.538 --> 29:03.675
Because she knew,
she was able to tell Agnes
how important you were to her.

29:03.810 --> 29:05.978
And her to you.

29:06.112 --> 29:08.547
It's why she encouraged
your relationship with Agnes.

29:10.216 --> 29:12.751
What if it's also a part
of why she died?

29:17.824 --> 29:19.191
I can't do it.

29:21.193 --> 29:22.261
That's all right.

29:27.033 --> 29:28.267
I don't want to.

29:30.336 --> 29:33.205
Her hesitation.
The time it took.

29:34.040 --> 29:36.108
If she hadn't hesitated,

29:38.077 --> 29:39.578
she might've survived.

29:44.083 --> 29:47.453
Eleanor, Dr. Sand,
she says Decanio has a crew

29:47.586 --> 29:49.956
working a job at a property
he owns downtown.

29:50.089 --> 29:51.790
Working on what?

29:51.924 --> 29:53.092
We've been nibbling
at the edges

29:53.225 --> 29:55.427
of the Decanios' syndicate
for years.

29:55.561 --> 29:57.296
If she wants a deal,
her intel's gonna have to

29:57.429 --> 29:58.965
lead us higher up
the food chain.

29:59.098 --> 30:01.233
All she knows is that
it's connected
to Mary Parrot's death,

30:01.367 --> 30:03.735
it involves her son,
and that the old man
said it's urgent.

30:03.870 --> 30:05.804
Companies associated
with the Decanios

30:05.938 --> 30:07.706
are mid-construction
on two sites
we know of downtown...

30:09.075 --> 30:12.411
A luxury hotel
and a residential tower.

30:12.544 --> 30:13.980
What's Parrot's connection?

30:14.113 --> 30:15.982
Was there
a preservationist objection?

30:16.115 --> 30:17.583
Not to those sites.

30:17.716 --> 30:21.587
Her big push downtown
was to landmark
Memorial Baptist Church.

30:21.720 --> 30:24.290
Now, she'd held up developers
who wanted to demolish it,

30:24.423 --> 30:27.459
but now that she's dead,
the sale can go through,
it can be torn down,

30:27.593 --> 30:29.996
And Decanio's
a silent partner.

30:30.129 --> 30:31.964
That's what this is about?

30:32.098 --> 30:35.067
Killing a preservationist
to demolish a church?

30:35.201 --> 30:37.069
We're missing something.
What?

30:37.203 --> 30:38.470
Well, sir, there is
something else.

30:38.604 --> 30:39.838
When cross-referencing
the address,

30:39.972 --> 30:43.175
the building next door
pinged our database.

30:43.309 --> 30:45.377
I recognize it,
this church.

30:45.511 --> 30:47.880
But I can't remember why.
What's the address?

30:48.014 --> 30:50.249
30 West Oak Street.
Oh, my God.

30:50.382 --> 30:52.618
Herman Levy, the informant,

30:52.751 --> 30:54.620
the one testifying
against Decanio...

30:54.753 --> 30:57.489
WITSEC is holding him at
a safehouse at 32 West Oak.

30:57.623 --> 30:59.125
They're trying to get to him
before he testifies.

30:59.258 --> 31:00.559
Not if we can
get to him first.

31:00.692 --> 31:02.394
Go.
I'll alert the Marshals,

31:02.528 --> 31:05.097
and Main Justice
about a deal for Sand.

31:05.231 --> 31:07.499
She didn't get us up
the food chain.
She got us to the top of it.

31:07.633 --> 31:09.301
Let's hope
we're not too late.

31:29.388 --> 31:30.689
All right.

31:30.822 --> 31:32.191
Third floor.
Let's move.

31:32.324 --> 31:33.325
Yeah.

32:02.754 --> 32:03.522
Grab the rat.

32:20.672 --> 32:22.108
FBI!

32:22.241 --> 32:23.375
FBI!
Drop your weapons!

32:28.847 --> 32:30.616
This is all very
confidence-inspiring.

32:34.086 --> 32:35.387
Dante Russo?

32:36.455 --> 32:37.456
I have the son.

32:41.727 --> 32:44.396
Dr. Sand is in custody.
She and her son.

32:44.530 --> 32:46.465
And Decanio?
<i>He's been arrested.</i>

32:46.598 --> 32:48.334
<i>The doctor's son
worked for him as well.</i>

32:48.467 --> 32:50.402
Both of them are set to be
transferred to Main Justice

32:50.536 --> 32:52.738
to sign immunity agreements
in exchange for

32:52.871 --> 32:54.306
everything they know
about Decanio.

32:55.441 --> 32:57.309
Have you spoken
with Agnes yet?

32:57.443 --> 32:59.411
Did she say whether she had
a good time or not?

32:59.545 --> 33:02.148
She said that you,
and I quote,

33:02.281 --> 33:04.416
"suck at state capitals,"

33:04.550 --> 33:07.486
<i>which I took to mean
a good time was had by all.</i>

33:07.619 --> 33:09.321
Yes.
<i>You're doing well with her.</i>

33:09.455 --> 33:10.556
<i>I'm impressed.</i>

33:10.689 --> 33:13.325
And hopeful that, like me,

33:13.459 --> 33:15.461
you're finding that
being around her helps,

33:16.128 --> 33:17.429
<i>in every way.</i>

33:20.266 --> 33:21.833
What about Sand?

33:21.967 --> 33:23.102
What do you think?

33:23.235 --> 33:26.072
You... You know her story.
Now you've questioned her.

33:26.205 --> 33:28.807
Do you think Decanio was right
to hire her?

33:28.940 --> 33:31.610
<i>I do. She's smart
and thoughtful.</i>

33:31.743 --> 33:33.445
<i>I'm not surprised with
the results she got.</i>

33:34.846 --> 33:36.848
We're gonna testify
against Vito?

33:36.982 --> 33:39.651
After he sent me to kidnap
a witness in federal custody,

33:39.785 --> 33:42.188
we're signing up
to <i>be</i> federal witnesses?

33:42.321 --> 33:43.789
We both know
it's the only way out.

33:43.922 --> 33:46.125
Well, what we know
is there's no way out.

33:46.792 --> 33:48.727
He's using you now.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.162
For dangerous jobs.

33:50.296 --> 33:51.563
I can't protect you anymore.

33:51.697 --> 33:53.031
You think the feds can?

33:54.666 --> 33:56.168
Hey.
What the hell is that?

33:56.302 --> 33:57.403
Hey. Hello?

33:57.536 --> 33:58.837
What is it?
What's going on?

33:58.970 --> 34:00.206
It's him.
Hey!

34:00.339 --> 34:02.474
Hello?
Mom. Mom.

34:02.608 --> 34:04.042
Get out of the van.
It's him.

34:04.176 --> 34:05.477
On your feet.

34:13.319 --> 34:15.053
Dr. Sand, I presume.

34:15.187 --> 34:16.155
You're Raymond Reddington.

34:16.288 --> 34:17.489
Did Decanio send you?

34:17.623 --> 34:19.024
Dear Vito's been detained.

34:19.158 --> 34:21.193
I'm here of my own volition
with a proposal.

34:21.327 --> 34:22.361
Would you care to hear it?

34:33.705 --> 34:35.207
Vito Decanio.

34:35.341 --> 34:36.808
Welcome to
federal custody.

34:36.942 --> 34:40.146
Been there twice,
for a total of six hours.

34:40.279 --> 34:41.813
Third time's the charm.

34:43.215 --> 34:44.416
Where are they?

34:44.550 --> 34:45.684
You heard me.
Where the hell are they?

34:45.817 --> 34:47.419
Agent Park...
Where did you take them?

34:47.553 --> 34:48.654
Alina, hey...
He hit the convoy.

34:48.787 --> 34:51.056
With Dr. sand.
She and her son,
they're gone.

34:51.190 --> 34:53.024
I got no idea
what you're talking about.

34:53.159 --> 34:54.693
If you did anything to her...
Okay. Stop.

34:58.864 --> 35:00.132
If you did anything,
we're gonna find out.

35:00.266 --> 35:02.100
I didn't do anything.

35:02.234 --> 35:04.403
But I'm in debt
to the person who did.

35:06.071 --> 35:07.539
Take him to interrogation.

35:10.976 --> 35:13.279
Your personal therapist?

35:13.412 --> 35:17.716
Yes, for which you'll be
well paid and safe from harm.

35:17.849 --> 35:19.751
You said
Decanio's been arrested.

35:19.885 --> 35:24.456
He has, but he has friends
in high places.

35:24.590 --> 35:26.225
Just not as high as me.

35:27.426 --> 35:29.127
I helped him
to protect my son.

35:29.261 --> 35:30.562
Why should I help you?

35:33.265 --> 35:34.400
I need your help.

35:36.468 --> 35:40.606
And what I do,
my professional life,

35:40.739 --> 35:43.275
you will not be
a part of that.

35:43.409 --> 35:46.378
Helping you personally
helps you professionally.

35:46.512 --> 35:48.580
That's how
this process works.

35:50.549 --> 35:52.784
Just give me three months.

35:52.918 --> 35:54.085
On the island
of your choice.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.088
At the end of which,
you're free to go.

35:57.223 --> 36:00.592
I hope you won't,
but it'll be up to you.

36:00.726 --> 36:02.994
Consider it
a palate cleanser.

36:03.128 --> 36:05.931
A transition from
a distasteful past

36:06.064 --> 36:08.600
to a delightfully
piquant future.

36:09.535 --> 36:10.602
Why me?

36:15.941 --> 36:20.312
The details of my story
are not for
the faint of heart.

36:20.446 --> 36:22.113
Based on your history,

36:22.248 --> 36:24.049
I believe you can stomach
pretty much anything.

36:25.083 --> 36:26.552
I'm not a miracle worker.

36:26.685 --> 36:29.388
No need. I already have
one of those.

36:30.656 --> 36:32.491
Let's talk islands.

36:39.298 --> 36:40.332
Headache?

36:41.132 --> 36:42.301
No.

36:43.168 --> 36:44.336
Embarrassment.

36:45.070 --> 36:46.372
For what?

36:46.505 --> 36:48.039
What,
losing it on Decanio?

36:48.173 --> 36:50.542
Come on, I understand.
This job...

36:50.676 --> 36:52.511
This job can get
under your skin.

36:56.882 --> 37:01.052
It's hard, being someone
who crosses lines.

37:01.186 --> 37:03.355
People judge you for it,
so then you judge yourself.

37:08.294 --> 37:10.296
Dr. Sand is right.

37:10.429 --> 37:12.464
We all have dark impulses.

37:12.598 --> 37:15.834
And most of the time,
there is no cure for that.

37:15.967 --> 37:17.569
So, the idea...

37:17.703 --> 37:19.971
Well, at least the idea
I came up with after spending

37:20.105 --> 37:23.342
my grandparents' entire
inheritance on therapy is...

37:24.943 --> 37:28.280
Is to not hate yourself
because you have
dark impulses,

37:29.348 --> 37:31.082
but to love yourself
in spite of them.

37:34.520 --> 37:35.921
How big was
your inheritance?

37:36.054 --> 37:38.256
$86,749.

37:40.559 --> 37:42.594
I'd say
it was money well spent.

37:47.032 --> 37:50.068
<i>Harold,
I hope you're right about
the good doctor's efficacy.</i>

37:50.201 --> 37:50.936
Sand.

37:52.137 --> 37:53.705
You took her.

37:53.839 --> 37:56.608
"Took" is a big strong,
but yes, she's agreed
to work with me.

37:56.742 --> 37:58.410
Instead of testifying
against Decanio.

37:58.544 --> 38:00.612
<i>There'll be plenty of
testifying against him</i>

38:00.746 --> 38:02.047
before it gets around to her.

38:02.180 --> 38:04.049
Hopefully, by then,
I'll be a better man

38:04.182 --> 38:06.885
<i>and she won't be
so frightened.</i>

38:07.719 --> 38:08.920
Gotta fly, Harold.

38:16.928 --> 38:19.598
Cvetko?
He just called.

38:19.731 --> 38:20.932
The prints match.

38:37.248 --> 38:38.750
Dr. Sand.

38:40.386 --> 38:41.753
We should talk.

39:02.941 --> 39:04.943
I told myself
I wasn't honest with you

39:05.076 --> 39:08.647
because if you found out
the truth about me,
about who I was,

39:09.815 --> 39:12.183
you wouldn't like
what you saw.

39:12.317 --> 39:13.885
But the truth is,
I wasn't honest

39:14.019 --> 39:17.288
because I didn't like
what I saw.

39:17.423 --> 39:18.824
It adds up
to the same thing.

39:24.763 --> 39:27.799
I couldn't expect you
to love me
when I didn't love myself.

39:30.001 --> 39:32.971
So, that's what
I'm gonna try and do.

39:34.506 --> 39:36.241
Learn to love myself.

39:37.843 --> 39:39.845
And maybe
you can love me, too.

40:01.500 --> 40:02.534
Harold Cooper.

40:02.668 --> 40:04.202
<i>I texted a photo.</i>

40:04.335 --> 40:05.437
<i>Look at it.</i>

40:06.404 --> 40:07.573
Who is this?

40:07.706 --> 40:09.274
<i>Look at it.</i>

40:13.512 --> 40:18.149
<i>There's audio, too,
of you and your friend
evidence-tampering.</i>

40:20.886 --> 40:23.254
What do you want?
<i>So much.</i>

40:23.388 --> 40:26.692
<i>And with what I know about you
and the murder of Doug Koster,</i>

40:26.825 --> 40:29.160
<i>I'm confident you're going to
give it to me.</i>

40:31.830 --> 40:34.633
I found
peace and tranquility

40:34.766 --> 40:38.804
and a real feeling of...

40:42.273 --> 40:43.108
Quiet.

40:45.711 --> 40:47.713
Yet, I abandoned it

40:49.047 --> 40:52.951
out of this compulsion
for chaos and peril.

40:58.089 --> 41:00.125
I had found light.

41:04.029 --> 41:06.131
Yet I'm compelled
by the dark.

41:10.602 --> 41:12.804
It animates me,

41:12.938 --> 41:14.906
so much so
that I drag others into it.

41:15.974 --> 41:18.777
Others that I care
desperately about.

41:22.581 --> 41:25.416
So, what is the purpose?

41:25.551 --> 41:29.721
If I'm willing to risk
everything good in my life,

41:29.855 --> 41:35.594
to even defend risking it
as necessary or just,

41:35.727 --> 41:37.696
when I know

41:38.764 --> 41:42.934
the result will only be...

41:47.606 --> 41:49.708
A deepening darkness.

41:53.078 --> 41:57.649
Tell me, where is this
coming from right now?

41:57.783 --> 41:58.850
Why now?

42:04.990 --> 42:06.892
I recently discovered
that I was betrayed

42:07.025 --> 42:08.994
by my oldest
and closest friend.

42:12.363 --> 42:15.667
I'm apprehensive about the
depth and breadth of my anger.
