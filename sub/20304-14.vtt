WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.377
-(men groaning)
-(glass shattering)

00:02.460 --> 00:04.963
NARRATOR:
<i>Coming tonight on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:05.046 --> 00:07.090
The rat that bit you was rabid.

00:07.173 --> 00:09.426
A cop's daughter was raped.

00:09.509 --> 00:11.803
Maybe I could get hurt
if I said something.

00:11.886 --> 00:14.347
Frank, she's my kid!
Give me two minutes with him.

00:14.431 --> 00:18.143
You're the first of 50 women
destined to perpetuate the species.

00:18.226 --> 00:19.769
(sighs) I think he wants to kill me.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.647
He hasn't broken any laws,
nothing we can arrest him for.

00:22.731 --> 00:24.816
Some girls really don't know
how to handle rejection.

00:24.899 --> 00:26.401
Girl's a little warped upstairs.

00:26.484 --> 00:28.194
You do good work, Miss McCoy.

00:29.237 --> 00:30.905
Feeling is mutual, Captain.

00:33.491 --> 00:34.701
-(laughing)
-(chattering)

00:34.784 --> 00:36.036
PHIL: Item 12.

00:36.411 --> 00:41.249
Kudos and felicitations due this a.m.
to three of Hill Street's very finest,

00:41.791 --> 00:45.170
winners in what we old-timers used to call
the Irish Sweepstakes,

00:45.253 --> 00:49.007
i.e., the semiannual promotions list.

00:49.090 --> 00:51.926
You will henceforth marshal
newfound respect

00:52.010 --> 00:55.597
for Sgt. Michael North,
promoted from patrolman.

00:55.680 --> 00:56.681
(cheering, applauding)

00:56.765 --> 00:59.017
Night Sgt. Wallace Peterson,

00:59.100 --> 01:02.479
and Lieutenant, formerly Sergeant,
Henry Goldblume.

01:02.562 --> 01:04.689
(cheering and applauding continues)

01:04.773 --> 01:05.607
Item 13.

01:05.690 --> 01:08.818
Operation Big Broom enters
a second planning stage this morning

01:08.902 --> 01:14.240
when Chief Daniels makes a walking tour
of Dekker from 130th to 135th.

01:14.324 --> 01:16.701
If you'll recall, Mayor D'Angelo

01:16.785 --> 01:19.704
visited this choice patch of Hilldom
two days ago

01:19.788 --> 01:22.415
and declared it
"the worst damn block in the city."

01:22.499 --> 01:23.792
-(murmuring)
-(chuckling)

01:23.875 --> 01:28.713
The Chief's job will be to determine
which of the five blocks His Honor meant,

01:29.506 --> 01:33.134
whereupon each of us, starting tomorrow
under Lt. Howard Hunter,

01:33.218 --> 01:35.095
will commence massive defoliation.

01:35.178 --> 01:37.931
Yes, people, it is an election year.

01:38.014 --> 01:39.557
(murmuring)

01:39.641 --> 01:44.229
Backups this a.m.: Bates, Coffey, Regan,
Phillips, Ballentine, Brewster.

01:44.312 --> 01:48.900
Item 14 is a cautionary tale
concerning last evening's full moon.

01:49.484 --> 01:52.779
Or rather a pale and reportedly
pock-marked imitation thereof

01:52.862 --> 01:54.823
which appeared on a front yard
in Pittsfield

01:55.031 --> 01:56.825
shortly after the 1:00 a.m. conclusion

01:56.908 --> 01:59.869
of Officer Mel Sandowski's
bachelor soirÃ©e.

02:00.078 --> 02:06.042
Shocked to see the famed celestial
provocateur in such exotic close-up,

02:06.126 --> 02:10.255
a Mrs. Friedkin from across the street
called the County Sheriff's office,

02:10.588 --> 02:14.300
which proceeded to arrest Hill Street's
own planetary adventurer,

02:14.384 --> 02:17.512
Andrew J. Renko,
on charges of public exposure.

02:17.595 --> 02:20.181
(jeering, laughing)

02:20.265 --> 02:23.434
You want to see it again?
You want to see it again?

02:24.102 --> 02:26.312
All right. Could everybody shut up
and leave me alone?

02:26.396 --> 02:29.107
Come on, Andrew, sit down. We've seen it.

02:29.190 --> 02:33.444
(laughing)

02:34.237 --> 02:35.655
After several phone calls,

02:35.738 --> 02:39.325
Captain Furillo reluctantly admitted
ownership of the officer gone amok...

02:39.409 --> 02:40.702
(laughing)

02:40.785 --> 02:42.495
...and he was released OR.

02:42.704 --> 02:44.747
The charge was subsequently dropped.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.667
Not as precipitously as the pants,
but nonetheless dropped.

02:47.750 --> 02:49.586
End of cautionary tale.

02:50.378 --> 02:53.715
Item last, on a more somber note.

02:54.215 --> 02:59.554
Midtown Lt. Jack Donleavy's
daughter Kathleen was raped and knifed

02:59.929 --> 03:03.308
shortly after 2:00 a.m.
in the parking lot of Mercy Hospital,

03:03.391 --> 03:04.684
where she's a nurse.

03:05.768 --> 03:07.103
A rather sketchy description,

03:07.187 --> 03:10.231
a large Caucasian male
with light brown hair is about it.

03:10.315 --> 03:14.319
But forensics match
the Valdez rape-homicide

03:14.402 --> 03:17.280
and the Pellegrini rape-assault
of last week.

03:18.865 --> 03:21.576
Now Donleavy's put 28 years
into this department,

03:21.659 --> 03:24.621
and as far as I know
he's universally beloved.

03:25.038 --> 03:28.208
His wife died three years ago,
and this is his only kid.

03:28.291 --> 03:30.168
So let's put a star next to this one, huh?

03:31.085 --> 03:35.215
All right, that's it. Let's roll,
and let's be careful out there.

03:35.298 --> 03:38.468
-(chairs scrapping)
-(chattering)

03:48.686 --> 03:50.939
It was not an obscene gesture.

03:51.022 --> 03:52.774
It was a friendly gesture

03:52.857 --> 03:56.527
directed at my friend Mel Sandowski
on his departure.

03:56.611 --> 03:57.946
-And the authorities--
-Renko?

03:58.321 --> 03:59.656
-Yes, sir.
-My office.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.909
(phone ringing)

04:11.209 --> 04:12.627
I hear you like motorcycles.

04:12.710 --> 04:14.545
Yes, sir, I got a big hog at home.

04:14.629 --> 04:16.422
Good. And fresh air?

04:16.923 --> 04:18.675
(sighs) Motor patrol, Captain?

04:18.758 --> 04:20.426
You're gonna put me out
there on a Harley with the big boys?

04:20.510 --> 04:24.013
Close. Two wheels.
But I was thinking more of a Vespa.

04:26.015 --> 04:28.351
That's a scooter, Captain.
Scooters are for women.

04:28.434 --> 04:29.852
No, it's not for women, Renko.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.646
It's for issuing parking tickets.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.983
You write up a book of these a day,
20 a month, and then we'll talk.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.988
Captain, sir, don't you think you might
be overreacting just a little bit?

04:40.071 --> 04:41.364
Overreacting?

04:41.864 --> 04:43.658
I'm in perfectly good humor.

04:43.866 --> 04:44.826
I'm always in good humor

04:44.909 --> 04:47.453
when the Sheriff's Department
phones me at 1:30 in the morning.

04:47.537 --> 04:50.415
I'm always in good humor
when one of my men demeans the badge.

04:50.498 --> 04:52.166
-That's all, Renko.
-Yes, sir.

04:56.462 --> 04:57.880
Sir, what about Bobby Hill?

04:58.131 --> 05:00.300
He'll be temporarily assigned
with Tattaglia.

05:00.383 --> 05:01.467
Good day, Officer.

05:03.886 --> 05:06.723
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:06.806 --> 05:08.516
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:08.599 --> 05:12.478
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:12.562 --> 05:14.063
(sirens wailing)

05:19.652 --> 05:23.448
(theme music playing)

06:23.299 --> 06:25.301
-Can I see you a minute, Frank?
-Yeah. Come on in, Jack.

06:25.385 --> 06:28.763
-How you doing?
-Good as can be expected, I guess.

06:28.846 --> 06:30.765
The latest on Kathleen sounds better.

06:31.432 --> 06:33.226
We're all grateful
she seems to be out of danger.

06:33.559 --> 06:35.019
What've you got on this one, Frank?

06:35.103 --> 06:38.022
Come on. You know the book, Jack.
You're family of the victim. I can't--

06:38.106 --> 06:39.941
Please, Frank. You gotta let me in here.

06:41.526 --> 06:45.363
I know what happens after 12 hours,
after a day or two goes by.

06:45.863 --> 06:48.950
-I'm not gonna let that happen this time.
-Eight men on the case full-time.

06:49.033 --> 06:51.119
It's absolutely top priority. I'm sorry.

06:51.202 --> 06:54.080
-I hope you'll understand.
-She's my only, Frank.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.875
I see her in there with all those tubes.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.961
-We'll get him, Jack.
-All smashed up.

07:00.044 --> 07:02.046
Now, you got a kid of your own, Frank.
What would you do?

07:02.130 --> 07:03.005
(door opens)

07:03.089 --> 07:05.508
Frank-- Oh, excuse me.

07:05.883 --> 07:08.803
Chief Daniels is waiting for you
and Howard in his car.

07:14.725 --> 07:15.935
I have to go.

07:16.686 --> 07:18.062
Please, give us room to work.

07:18.729 --> 07:21.524
Ray, you want to copy the 4-17s
and all the pink sheets

07:21.607 --> 07:23.067
and then get phone numbers
where he can be reached?

07:23.151 --> 07:24.318
You'll be at the hospital?

07:24.819 --> 07:27.238
I just want to catch that animal,
you know?

07:27.822 --> 07:29.866
That's what I feel inside.

07:30.575 --> 07:32.326
I want to catch him, and I wanna--

07:33.703 --> 07:35.037
Oh, Kathleen.

07:35.121 --> 07:37.498
I told you, we'll give it our all
and we'll get him.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.961
(door opens, closes)

07:43.254 --> 07:45.006
On this single block alone,

07:45.089 --> 07:47.967
you figure a drug transaction
every seven minutes,

07:48.050 --> 07:51.304
felonious violence 40 times a week,

07:51.554 --> 07:54.557
have eight or ten major
brand names of heroin

07:54.640 --> 07:56.767
openly available for the asking.

07:57.018 --> 07:58.352
(chuckles)

07:58.436 --> 08:01.731
One of the popular ones
is named the Chief, Chief.

08:02.023 --> 08:05.026
You know, Forbes, you hear stats
like that, the weight feels good.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.153
Sir?

08:07.945 --> 08:11.157
I'm packing the old S&amp;W .38 today, Howard.

08:12.283 --> 08:15.453
Sir! It's nice to have you come around.

08:15.536 --> 08:18.372
(laughing)

08:18.456 --> 08:21.584
Ah, here is 1737 Dekker.

08:21.667 --> 08:25.171
Now, this is locally known
as the Black Hole of the Hill.

08:25.254 --> 08:28.299
It's the worst shooting gallery
in the city, Chief,

08:28.382 --> 08:30.801
open for your inspection.

08:31.135 --> 08:34.805
I had a few of the EATers
do a little carpet sweeping an hour ago.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.016
I'd kind of like to have a little
look-see. How about you, Forbes?

08:37.099 --> 08:39.602
-Coming.
-(vehicle horn honking)

08:45.316 --> 08:48.069
(sirens wailing)

08:53.574 --> 08:55.535
Well, what do you think, old sport?
(exhales)

08:56.118 --> 08:59.455
Is the Chief about to approve the most
massive inner-city housecleaning

08:59.539 --> 09:03.376
since we put it to those geeks
in Haiphong Harbor or am I Herbert Hoover?

09:03.709 --> 09:06.170
-Nice imagery, Howard.
-Oh, come on, Frank.

09:06.254 --> 09:09.715
Give an old EATer a break.
This could be my shot at a captaincy.

09:10.007 --> 09:13.636
(gunfire)

09:13.886 --> 09:15.930
HOWARD: All Units! All Units! Report!
Have you been fired on?

09:16.013 --> 09:18.057
-What the hell's going on?
-Who's all right!

09:18.140 --> 09:20.184
LUCY: The Chief got bit by a rat.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.689
He must've stuck his hand
in a nest or something.

09:24.772 --> 09:27.108
He got off six rounds
with his own revolver.

09:27.441 --> 09:30.528
Just a nick! Nothing to worry about.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.406
I think I winged the little bugger
in the left haunch there.

09:33.489 --> 09:35.449
There were drops of blood.
You definitely scored a hit, sir.

09:35.533 --> 09:36.617
-Yeah.
-Just a nick, Chief.

09:36.701 --> 09:39.912
But "just a nick" raises a specter
of rat fever, plague...

09:41.706 --> 09:43.291
I want this building sealed off.

09:44.041 --> 09:45.876
I want Animal Control notified.

09:46.168 --> 09:47.545
I want ten of our own men to assist.

09:47.628 --> 09:50.840
I want that rat found and delivered
to the Department of Health for testing.

09:50.923 --> 09:52.341
Chief, there are probably
a thousand rodents--

09:52.425 --> 09:53.426
Oh, damn it, Howard!

09:53.509 --> 09:56.137
I told you that I put a .38
into his hindquarters.

09:56.220 --> 09:57.972
If that's not a cross
painted on his back--

09:58.055 --> 09:59.432
We'll get right on it, Chief.

10:00.182 --> 10:04.270
(motor engine revving)

10:47.688 --> 10:50.066
(sighs) Come on, you gotta be kidding me.

10:50.441 --> 10:52.318
Benedetto, Division Vice.

10:52.777 --> 10:53.819
Uh...

10:53.903 --> 10:55.655
I'm sorry there, Detective Benedetto,

10:55.738 --> 10:58.574
but I woulda trashed this
if you woulda showed up two minutes ago.

10:58.658 --> 10:59.825
But as it is, I've been writing it,

10:59.909 --> 11:01.577
so I'm afraid I have
to be responsible for it.

11:01.661 --> 11:02.828
What, are you making me laugh?

11:02.912 --> 11:04.789
I get 50 of these taken care of a year.

11:04.872 --> 11:06.207
Well, then take care of it.

11:12.296 --> 11:14.715
I guess I could get you
for littering now, couldn't I?

11:15.091 --> 11:16.092
You know what you are?

11:16.550 --> 11:18.344
You're a fat punk on a scooter.

11:22.223 --> 11:23.391
(tapping brake light)

11:23.474 --> 11:25.810
Looks like you have an equipment
problem there, brother.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.650
(crashes)

11:32.733 --> 11:33.776
So do you.

11:38.072 --> 11:39.615
-Well, my friend--
-Come on, right here.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.784
I'm gonna kick your butt
right in your uniform.

11:43.160 --> 11:46.831
I'll tell you what.
I got a job to finish today.

11:47.081 --> 11:50.084
If you want a piece of me,
I'll be at Mulligan's after 6:00 tonight.

12:02.513 --> 12:04.640
BOBBY: I know Pete's death
was pretty rough on you.

12:04.724 --> 12:07.268
You ever thought
about quitting or leaving?

12:07.351 --> 12:08.769
ROBIN: I worked too hard to get here.

12:09.311 --> 12:11.981
I never kidded myself
about what this job could be.

12:13.399 --> 12:16.402
Then it happened, and it was rotten luck.

12:16.485 --> 12:17.319
(tires screeching)

12:17.403 --> 12:19.071
-(horn honking)
-ROBIN: Hey, look at that.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.990
-BOBBY: That's pretty obvious.
-(siren wailing)

12:21.073 --> 12:22.241
Okay.

12:23.367 --> 12:25.035
I'll write this one up.

12:25.619 --> 12:27.872
(siren wailing continues)

12:36.672 --> 12:37.673
(car door opens, closes)

12:40.551 --> 12:43.512
-License and registration.
-It's my uncle's car.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.765
I don't know why he...

12:46.432 --> 12:48.559
-Bobby, he's got a gun!
-Hold it right there!

12:49.560 --> 12:51.896
It ain't my car. It ain't my gun.

12:51.979 --> 12:54.690
-Just get out the car, slowly now.
-I swear.

12:55.816 --> 12:58.110
-It ain't my gun. I swear.
-Come on.

12:59.278 --> 13:02.156
Go ask my uncle, John Rovere.
He's got a permit.

13:03.157 --> 13:04.200
What're you doing?

13:06.702 --> 13:08.370
"Kathleen Donleavy."

13:08.788 --> 13:11.957
All right, pal, you got
some explaining to do here.

13:12.291 --> 13:15.878
You could just stick a fork in me now,
Jack, 'cause I'm done.

13:20.966 --> 13:21.884
Hi.

13:24.512 --> 13:25.513
Hi.

13:26.055 --> 13:28.641
Nancy McCoy, Office of Corrections.

13:28.724 --> 13:31.352
I was told that you're holding
Leonard Smithers.

13:31.602 --> 13:33.979
Captain Furillo. Uh, yes.

13:34.313 --> 13:36.732
He hasn't exactly been a model
of cooperation. I could use your help.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.985
-I heard you got somebody.
-FRANK: No. No suspects yet, Jack.

13:40.069 --> 13:42.404
Somebody who had my daughter's card!
Let me see him, let me talk to him.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.740
It's being handled.
You'll get everything as it comes in.

13:44.824 --> 13:47.576
Damn it, Frank, she's my kid!
Give me two minutes with him.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.578
No, Jack. I've got it.

13:50.329 --> 13:52.540
You have my complete sympathy
for everything that's happened,

13:52.623 --> 13:55.709
but you can't do anything here
but hinder us and hurt yourself.

13:56.710 --> 13:57.878
Get him, Frank.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.051
(clears throat)

14:04.134 --> 14:06.679
How much do you know
about the Donleavy situation?

14:07.096 --> 14:10.474
I know about Smithers
and Kathleen Donleavy's credit card.

14:10.558 --> 14:11.892
He won't tell us where he got it.

14:12.101 --> 14:14.019
Maybe we should go talk to him.

14:15.980 --> 14:18.232
(phone ringing)

14:20.109 --> 14:21.527
WOMAN: Sgt. Goldblume?

14:21.610 --> 14:23.404
Lt. Goldblume. What can I do for you?

14:23.487 --> 14:25.573
Well, the man at the desk
said I should talk to you.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.408
I want you to arrest this guy I know.

14:27.658 --> 14:28.951
Why, what's he done?

14:29.034 --> 14:32.997
He killed my cat. It's against the law
to kill somebody's cat, isn't it?

14:35.541 --> 14:36.542
Yeah, it is.

14:39.003 --> 14:40.963
Did you actually see him do it?

14:41.547 --> 14:44.258
But I know it's him.
He used to be my boyfriend.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.635
Okay. What's your name and address, miss?

14:46.719 --> 14:48.345
(sighs) Mary Hicks.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.598
-I live at 41--
-Whoa, whoa. Yeah?

14:50.681 --> 14:53.726
41 Dekker. I'm a waitress.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.060
And your boyfriend?

14:55.519 --> 14:57.605
He used to be my boyfriend.

14:58.147 --> 15:02.067
I only knew him for a couple of weeks
and he started acting crazy.

15:02.151 --> 15:05.321
I couldn't talk to anybody
without him calling me a tramp.

15:05.696 --> 15:09.325
So I told him I didn't want to see him
anymore, but he won't leave me alone.

15:09.658 --> 15:12.661
-His name?
-Richard Brady.

15:13.287 --> 15:15.915
He's a mechanic
at Solly's Automotive Service.

15:16.790 --> 15:20.586
Mary, I don't think there's anything
we can do about your cat,

15:20.669 --> 15:22.421
not if there weren't any witnesses.

15:23.088 --> 15:24.673
Could've been struck by a car.

15:24.757 --> 15:28.052
He left it hanging in front of my door.
He wanted to make sure that I saw it.

15:28.969 --> 15:31.513
He follows me home from night school.

15:31.597 --> 15:35.559
He calls me up in the middle of the night.
He says that I'm his girl, no matter what.

15:35.643 --> 15:37.353
I think he wants to kill me.

15:38.604 --> 15:42.358
Has he ever assaulted you
or forced his way into your home

15:42.441 --> 15:44.068
or made any kind of threat?

15:44.151 --> 15:46.195
Well, he grabbed me once by the arm.

15:46.570 --> 15:50.407
But he's never physically hurt you
or said he's gonna kill you?

15:50.491 --> 15:51.325
No.

15:52.993 --> 15:53.827
Okay.

15:54.495 --> 15:58.582
Mary, I'm gonna be assigning you
what we call a case number.

15:59.291 --> 16:03.170
Now, if Mr. Brady ever makes
any kind of overt threat,

16:03.587 --> 16:06.465
I want you to call the police dispatcher,
the number's right there,

16:06.757 --> 16:10.260
-and you'll get immediate assistance.
-That's it?

16:10.719 --> 16:13.639
I wish there was more that we could do,
but from what you've told me,

16:13.722 --> 16:16.058
he hasn't broken any laws,
nothing we can arrest him for.

16:16.141 --> 16:17.726
But what about me? What do I do?

16:18.352 --> 16:21.480
Change your phone number,
the lock on your door.

16:22.606 --> 16:25.192
-You can move.
-But I haven't done anything wrong!

16:25.275 --> 16:27.277
Why can't you just tell him
to leave me alone?

16:27.361 --> 16:30.030
-Mary, unless he actually--
-He killed my cat!

16:30.114 --> 16:31.782
-I'm sorry...
-(thuds)

16:31.865 --> 16:33.242
...there's nothing I can do.

16:34.410 --> 16:36.870
You want to tell me
about the young lady's credit card?

16:37.788 --> 16:40.499
I found it, uh... in an alley.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.168
You know something, Smitty?

16:44.211 --> 16:47.631
You're about the best parolee I've had
in a very long time.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.299
-Yeah?
-NANCY: Mm-hmm.

16:49.383 --> 16:52.302
You keep your appointments,
and you do very good in your job.

16:53.178 --> 16:55.764
In fact, I was gonna recommend
to the Board

16:55.848 --> 16:58.017
that we cut you back to one visit a month.

16:58.767 --> 17:00.602
-You're okay, Miss M.
-Yeah.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.522
It'd be a shame
if you had to go back to prison.

17:03.605 --> 17:05.065
But I didn't do nothing!

17:05.566 --> 17:08.318
That was my uncle's gun. It was his car!

17:08.402 --> 17:12.781
Smitty, nobody cares
about the car or the gun.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.369
A cop's daughter was raped.

17:18.537 --> 17:20.873
They know I had nothing to do with that.

17:21.165 --> 17:22.374
You had her card.

17:23.292 --> 17:25.836
And you're withholding information
on where you got it.

17:26.336 --> 17:28.130
Now they can make you a part of that.

17:28.213 --> 17:29.339
I got a lawyer coming.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.259
-You can't do this to me.
-(sighs)

17:33.343 --> 17:35.179
Lawyers don't figure in this.

17:36.930 --> 17:38.557
Smitty, if you want to help yourself,

17:38.640 --> 17:41.518
you've got to help these men
find the man who did it.

17:42.061 --> 17:45.022
Otherwise,
it's back to prison in ten days.

17:45.272 --> 17:47.691
Maybe I could get hurt
if I said something.

17:48.442 --> 17:50.110
Nobody's going to know.

17:50.819 --> 17:53.197
-Isn't that right, Captain?
-That's right.

17:57.326 --> 17:58.327
Okay.

18:00.162 --> 18:02.706
Okay. It was Martin White.

18:03.832 --> 18:06.251
I got the card from Martin White.

18:08.504 --> 18:09.838
Move him into holding.

18:10.964 --> 18:13.967
Ray, pull the file on a Martin White.

18:14.635 --> 18:16.762
Uh, put his photo together
with four or five others.

18:16.845 --> 18:18.722
Take them down to Kathleen Donleavy
at the hospital.

18:18.806 --> 18:21.225
-I want a photo ID.
-All right, Frank.

18:22.559 --> 18:25.354
Do you think you can get Smitty released
as soon as possible?

18:25.437 --> 18:28.565
-He's just a sweetie.
-I'll see to it.

18:30.526 --> 18:31.735
You, uh...

18:33.445 --> 18:35.239
You do good work, Miss McCoy.

18:36.281 --> 18:38.117
Feeling is mutual, Captain.

18:39.827 --> 18:42.663
If you ever have, uh, trouble
with one of my boys again,

18:42.746 --> 18:44.373
just give me a call.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.125
I'm in the book.

18:51.588 --> 18:53.841
Coffey, Bates. Your presence is requested

18:53.924 --> 18:57.344
to assist in a public disturbance call
at 714 North Park.

18:57.553 --> 18:59.388
Possible weapons discharged.

19:02.891 --> 19:06.687
I don't know, the guy's always been so
nice, but I swear it was a gunshot.

19:06.770 --> 19:07.771
He's right here.

19:12.568 --> 19:13.443
(thuds)

19:14.319 --> 19:15.654
Oh, there's two of you. Good.

19:15.737 --> 19:18.365
Mr. Patrakis,
we're from the Police Department.

19:18.448 --> 19:19.616
Yes, I know.

19:20.033 --> 19:21.243
Has it started yet?

19:22.995 --> 19:24.746
-Has what started?
-Chaos.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.665
Chaos in the streets.

19:26.748 --> 19:29.209
See, I've been monitoring all morning
on the shortwave

19:29.293 --> 19:33.088
and all I could get is a food riot
in Botswana.

19:33.964 --> 19:36.675
Mr. Patrakis, we're gonna have to come in
and look at the premises.

19:36.758 --> 19:39.636
(laughs) I knew they'd listen
to me sooner or later.

19:39.720 --> 19:40.721
Okay.

19:41.555 --> 19:44.683
Listen, I can only open
the door for 20 seconds.

19:44.766 --> 19:46.643
Not a... Not a fraction longer.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.353
So you're gonna have
to slip in as fast as you can, okay?

19:48.437 --> 19:49.688
-Yeah, yeah.
-Okay.

19:49.771 --> 19:53.317
(chains rattling, locks turning)

19:53.400 --> 19:55.110
All right. Quick! Quick! Come on.

19:55.611 --> 19:57.738
(chuckles)

19:57.821 --> 20:00.199
All right. Huh?

20:00.282 --> 20:02.951
-Okay, what do you think?
-(radio chatter)

20:03.493 --> 20:05.204
We got our discharge right here, huh?

20:05.287 --> 20:06.997
Oh, yes. You see,
that was the nine millimeter.

20:07.080 --> 20:09.166
It went off, you know,
while I was cleaning it.

20:09.333 --> 20:12.878
Uh, see, look, it didn't
even dent the wall. Look.

20:12.961 --> 20:14.838
(laughs)

20:15.422 --> 20:17.716
Oh, yeah. Did you know...

20:17.799 --> 20:21.303
did you know that I can make seven pair
of shoes out of that old whitewall?

20:21.386 --> 20:23.513
Bet you never thought of that, huh?
(chuckles)

20:23.597 --> 20:26.099
And look, see, ultra-violet rays.

20:26.183 --> 20:28.852
The body can't manufacture
vitamin D without it.

20:29.186 --> 20:32.439
I can go... I can go months
without seeing the sun. (chuckles)

20:32.522 --> 20:35.234
Oh, and I put in air vents just last week.

20:35.317 --> 20:39.363
They're up on the roof
disguised as badminton poles.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.156
Badminton poles, pretty good.

20:42.491 --> 20:44.952
You mind telling me what the hell
you're talking about?

20:45.369 --> 20:46.870
I mean, what is all this stuff?

20:47.913 --> 20:51.917
What? What do you mean?
You mean, you're not here about my report?

20:52.000 --> 20:53.669
You see, I sent it
to all the precincts in the city.

20:53.752 --> 20:56.588
I sent diagrams, maps, contingency plans.

20:57.172 --> 21:00.634
Well, good Lord, man, society
is strangling on its own internal poisons!

21:00.717 --> 21:04.388
I mean, the whole shuddering mess
is getting ready to fall at our feet!

21:04.721 --> 21:07.808
And the only ones who are gonna survive
are those who have planned for it.

21:08.141 --> 21:11.353
-Okay? Me.
-Joe, he's got dynamite.

21:11.436 --> 21:13.647
Of course I have dynamite!
How do you expect me to defend myself

21:13.730 --> 21:15.440
with just 14 firearms
and 3,000 rounds of ammo?

21:15.524 --> 21:17.109
-You are under arrest.
-What?

21:17.192 --> 21:20.028
Possession of illegal
firearms and explosives.

21:20.112 --> 21:23.115
Listen. I'm trying to help
you people by example. See?

21:23.198 --> 21:25.033
-Okay. Keep your hands up there.
-Okay.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.744
Listen, I've thought of everything. I
I thought of defense, mobility,

21:27.828 --> 21:31.832
uh, communication,
uh, entertainment, sanitation.

21:32.249 --> 21:33.542
All right, look over there. See?

21:33.625 --> 21:35.502
I have a 15-megawatt generator,

21:35.585 --> 21:39.131
I have $10,000 in gold sovereigns,
and look, look, see?

21:39.214 --> 21:40.215
Look.

21:41.508 --> 21:46.096
I have Encyclopedia Britannica,
a complete set with the yearbooks.

21:46.763 --> 21:50.809
I've even... I've even devised a plan
to repopulate society

21:50.892 --> 21:53.312
by propagating myself to the power of ten!

21:53.687 --> 21:54.730
-Okay?
-Oh, yeah? How?

21:54.813 --> 21:57.232
-Uh, Joe, I think I know how.
-Yes.

21:57.316 --> 22:00.944
I'm only lacking one thing.
I need 50 good women.

22:02.112 --> 22:03.739
-Don't we all.
-Yeah.

22:04.614 --> 22:07.159
WOMAN (on speaker):
<i>Mrs. Baker, please come to Admitting.</i>

22:08.493 --> 22:09.494
What do you want?

22:09.578 --> 22:11.580
Officers Hill and Tattaglia, Lt. Donleavy.

22:11.663 --> 22:15.000
We're working the investigation.
We'd like to talk with your daughter.

22:15.083 --> 22:16.126
Why? What've you got?

22:17.002 --> 22:19.254
If we could just have
a moment with her, sir.

22:20.005 --> 22:21.673
You mean without the old man around.

22:22.883 --> 22:24.760
Well, maybe she doesn't want me to leave.

22:25.385 --> 22:27.179
Maybe I'm gonna stay
whether you like it or not.

22:27.262 --> 22:28.263
KATHLEEN: Daddy.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.807
Daddy, it's okay.

22:33.185 --> 22:36.605
All right, baby. If you say it's okay.

22:37.314 --> 22:39.524
I'm gonna be right outside,
if you need me.

22:39.608 --> 22:42.861
Okay. You'll come back when they're done?

22:43.153 --> 22:46.073
You bet. Don't let them wear you down.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.620
Go easy on her.

23:02.672 --> 23:05.842
Kathleen, I have five
pictures to show you.

23:06.718 --> 23:07.886
They're of different men.

23:09.262 --> 23:13.767
If you see the man who hurt you,
I want you to point to him, okay?

23:27.322 --> 23:28.323
(gasps)

23:29.241 --> 23:31.952
Oh, God! (sobs)

23:32.452 --> 23:34.704
Kathleen, if you could
look at all the pictures.

23:35.122 --> 23:36.498
I saw him.

23:37.833 --> 23:40.001
(sobbing) It was the fourth one.

23:40.627 --> 23:42.254
Please, if you could point to him.

23:47.092 --> 23:48.093
Oh, God!

23:49.219 --> 23:50.429
(sobs)

23:50.512 --> 23:52.556
(crying)

23:52.639 --> 23:55.934
-It's all right, baby. Your daddy's here.
-Daddy.

23:56.017 --> 23:57.727
Your daddy's here. Your daddy's here.

23:57.811 --> 24:00.272
It's all right. It's all right.
That's all right.

24:00.439 --> 24:03.066
She got him, didn't she? She got him.

24:04.067 --> 24:07.654
-(sobbing)
-It's okay. It's okay.

24:13.201 --> 24:16.746
In your urban areas
you got two basic types of vermin.

24:17.164 --> 24:20.667
You got your Norway rats,
you got your wharf rat.

24:21.168 --> 24:23.795
Those are the plague-carrying,
baby-biting,

24:24.212 --> 24:28.967
basement-inhabiting type of rats
which we happen to be trapping right here.

24:29.050 --> 24:31.553
Farley's wife makes
the bait in her kitchen.

24:32.304 --> 24:34.639
Wilma. Yeah, she does.

24:34.723 --> 24:39.186
Yeah, she does.
Popcorn, Cheez Whiz and peanut butter.

24:39.519 --> 24:41.813
They just can't get enough of it.

24:41.897 --> 24:43.190
-(traps snap)
-(rats squeaking)

24:43.273 --> 24:45.484
There's two more, Farley.
There's two more!

24:45.567 --> 24:46.860
FARLEY: Didn't I tell you?

24:47.611 --> 24:50.280
Yeah, but look, you figure
this is gonna take long, Farley?

24:50.739 --> 24:52.449
Well, now, that's hard to say.

24:52.991 --> 24:55.368
A day, maybe two,

24:55.827 --> 24:58.580
maybe a week, maybe never.

24:59.039 --> 25:02.083
You know, I had this rat once,
as big as a hedgehog.

25:02.542 --> 25:04.503
He was biting some residents
of a flophouse

25:04.586 --> 25:08.548
over on 110th back in, uh, '62.

25:08.840 --> 25:09.883
Big sucker!

25:10.592 --> 25:14.179
I nicknamed him Bohannon, the boss rat.

25:14.262 --> 25:15.096
Hey, Farley--

25:15.514 --> 25:18.433
Damn, Toby, I'm trying to tell them
about Bohannon.

25:18.808 --> 25:20.727
But we're all out of traps, Farley.

25:21.645 --> 25:24.689
Well, why don't we go to the truck
and get some, Toby?

25:24.773 --> 25:26.149
That's a good idea, Farley.

25:26.233 --> 25:28.902
You guys just hold the fort here
while me and Toby go to the truck.

25:28.985 --> 25:32.239
Come on, Toby.
You know, you're embarrassing, Toby.

25:34.324 --> 25:36.743
You know, I got three years
of college, Neal.

25:37.118 --> 25:39.871
I got two medals of valor,
three citations for bravery,

25:39.955 --> 25:42.916
and after 12 years
of dedicated service to my community,

25:42.999 --> 25:45.919
where do I find myself
at the ripe old age of 36?

25:46.002 --> 25:48.463
I'm in some stinking ghetto boiler room

25:48.547 --> 25:51.299
chaperoning the Captain Ahab
of the rat kingdom

25:51.383 --> 25:53.426
and his retarded first mate.

25:54.094 --> 25:57.264
Man. Man, did you know
that F. Scott Fitzgerald

25:57.347 --> 25:59.849
wrote<i> The Great Gatsby</i>
by the time he was 29?

25:59.933 --> 26:01.685
Oh, man.

26:02.269 --> 26:05.772
I remember this big fat,
ugly rat grinning at me

26:05.855 --> 26:08.400
through the slats of my crib
when I was about two years old.

26:08.483 --> 26:10.986
Ooh, man, I can't handle this, J.D.

26:11.236 --> 26:13.655
Man, do you think
this could really take a whole week?

26:13.863 --> 26:18.034
Oh, man. Ten million rodents
in the big naked city, man.

26:18.118 --> 26:22.289
Hell, trying to find one particular rat
with a .38 slug in his hindquarters.

26:22.372 --> 26:24.583
That may take a month and then some.

26:24.666 --> 26:26.668
-(trap snaps)
-Take it easy, man.

26:26.960 --> 26:28.086
-It's over here.
-Go, go. Go see.

26:28.169 --> 26:29.671
I'm going, I'm going. Come on.

26:32.299 --> 26:33.425
Ugh!

26:33.508 --> 26:37.387
Eww, man, that's disgusting.

26:38.138 --> 26:42.100
Man, that sucker's gotta weigh
at least four pounds if an ounce.

26:43.602 --> 26:44.936
Hey, man, Neal.

26:46.062 --> 26:50.900
What would you say if I told you
that that's the bucker that got Daniels?

26:51.443 --> 26:53.987
Hey, man, I'd say you
was daydreaming, babe.

26:54.529 --> 26:56.990
I mean, that dude is clean
in the hindquarters. See?

26:57.449 --> 27:00.285
-Yeah. Yeah, he is.
-(gunshot)

27:00.368 --> 27:02.704
Look again, man. (chuckles)

27:02.787 --> 27:06.291
-Yeah.
-(both laughs)

27:06.374 --> 27:08.335
(phone ringing)

27:09.753 --> 27:13.381
Frank, I know you're busy,
so I'll make this fast and to the point.

27:13.590 --> 27:14.966
It's about Frank Jr.

27:16.176 --> 27:18.845
Well, he came home early
from school Tuesday

27:18.928 --> 27:22.807
and he kinda caught me au naturel,
if you know what I mean.

27:23.475 --> 27:24.392
Fay, you're his mother.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.019
It's not the first time
he's seen you like that.

27:26.102 --> 27:29.022
It's the first time he's seen me like that
with a naked judge.

27:29.105 --> 27:32.025
-Paul Grogan?
-No, Sandra Day O'Connor.

27:32.108 --> 27:33.276
Of course it was Paul.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.153
We didn't expect him for three hours.

27:35.236 --> 27:37.447
But it seems
that the furnace blew up at school,

27:37.530 --> 27:39.074
and they sent the kids home early.

27:39.699 --> 27:42.410
And, uh, when he heard me screaming,

27:42.494 --> 27:45.455
he must have thought I was being attacked
by a burglar or something and--

27:45.538 --> 27:48.750
-You were screaming?
-And he got that boomerang

27:48.833 --> 27:51.294
that you gave him for Christmas
out of his toy box

27:51.378 --> 27:54.047
and then he came running into the bedroom.

27:55.215 --> 27:57.384
God, Frank, you should've seen the look
on his little face

27:57.467 --> 27:58.802
when he saw it was Paul.

27:58.885 --> 28:00.804
Well, darn it!

28:01.304 --> 28:05.350
Paul was having his rug shampooed
and hotels are so expensive and--

28:06.017 --> 28:08.895
Well, how was I to know
that damn furnace would blow up?

28:08.978 --> 28:11.690
As I recall, Fay, you ranted at me

28:11.773 --> 28:14.859
for a full week last year
for a similar transgression.

28:15.193 --> 28:18.822
That was different.
Don't you start with me, buster!

28:18.905 --> 28:21.574
You have absolutely no idea
how difficult it is

28:21.658 --> 28:24.494
for a divorced mother
to have a normal sexual relationship.

28:24.577 --> 28:26.579
What with tucking them in at night

28:26.663 --> 28:28.832
and getting them off
to school in the morning

28:29.708 --> 28:32.085
and juggling babysitters.

28:34.212 --> 28:38.174
-You want me to have a talk with him?
-I don't think he's in any mood to talk.

28:38.675 --> 28:40.885
I left over eight messages
on his answering service,

28:40.969 --> 28:42.303
and he hasn't returned one of them.

28:42.387 --> 28:44.305
Frank Jr. doesn't have
an answering service, Fay.

28:44.597 --> 28:47.684
I meant Paul! (sighs)

28:47.767 --> 28:52.564
You see, after Frank Jr.
hit him with the boomerang,

28:53.064 --> 28:54.566
he locked himself in the bathroom.

28:54.816 --> 28:59.404
And, uh, Paul and I had a rather
heated discussion on child rearing.

29:00.155 --> 29:01.698
He's cut me out of his life, Frank.

29:01.781 --> 29:02.782
I'll tell you what.

29:03.533 --> 29:06.619
I'll have a talk with Frank Jr.,
you take care of His Honor.

29:06.911 --> 29:08.997
How? I can't even get him on the phone.

29:09.080 --> 29:13.001
(sighs) Well, can your insurance rates
handle another traffic court appearance?

29:13.084 --> 29:15.503
-Just kidding.
-(phone ringing)

29:17.422 --> 29:19.716
Yeah, Furillo. (clears throat) Mm-hmm.

29:20.675 --> 29:21.926
Uh, hold on a minute.

29:22.010 --> 29:23.887
Fay, I really have a lot of work
to do here.

29:24.888 --> 29:26.473
I'm sure you'll think of something.

29:28.349 --> 29:31.352
Hey, Mick.
Got an address on the rape suspect.

29:31.770 --> 29:36.149
Here. Take, uh, Tattaglia,
Coffey, Bates, Hill,

29:36.232 --> 29:37.984
uh, as backups, huh?

29:43.323 --> 29:44.949
Lt. Goldblume.

29:46.785 --> 29:51.247
He was waiting for me when I got home
and he stopped me on the street, and...

29:52.415 --> 29:54.083
that's when he showed me the knife.

29:54.459 --> 29:56.836
(sighs) It was like a hunting knife.

29:59.923 --> 30:01.466
Did he pull out the blade, Mary?

30:03.134 --> 30:07.263
-Did he take the knife out of the sheath?
-No, not really.

30:08.389 --> 30:12.560
I mean, he didn't actually...
He just held it in front of me,

30:12.644 --> 30:14.604
really weird, like, and started talking.

30:17.065 --> 30:20.026
He said that he bought it
especially for me

30:20.109 --> 30:22.070
and how sharp it was,

30:22.153 --> 30:24.614
and how he was gonna give it to me
sometime as a present.

30:26.366 --> 30:28.284
And he just stared at me the whole time,

30:28.868 --> 30:33.748
kinda smiling, and said
that it was gonna be a surprise.

30:35.416 --> 30:38.294
He's gotta be locked up, Lieutenant!
Please!

30:38.378 --> 30:40.463
He wants to kill me! I know it!

30:41.965 --> 30:44.509
Mary, the DA would throw it out
in two minutes.

30:45.009 --> 30:48.096
He'd be out on the street in five,
even angrier than he is now.

30:49.138 --> 30:53.226
-And I know you don't want that.
-(sobbing)

30:54.269 --> 30:55.562
What can you do?

30:58.606 --> 30:59.816
I can have a talk with him.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.026
Do you want me to talk to him?

31:04.362 --> 31:07.323
(horn honking)

31:16.958 --> 31:19.544
(horn honking)

31:19.627 --> 31:21.754
(tires screeching)

31:21.838 --> 31:24.424
(honking continues)

31:24.507 --> 31:26.885
(tires screeching)

31:31.264 --> 31:35.059
-(siren wailing)
-(engine revving)

31:50.533 --> 31:53.286
Just where'd you get
your dang license, lady?

31:53.369 --> 31:56.247
At the bottom of some box
of crunchy granola?

31:59.208 --> 32:00.752
Oh, hello there, Mrs. Furillo.

32:00.835 --> 32:02.837
Come on, come on.
Are you gonna give me a ticket or what?

32:04.005 --> 32:06.132
-No, ma'am. I am not.
-Why not?

32:06.215 --> 32:09.802
Oh, I've had enough problems
with your ex-husband today.

32:09.886 --> 32:12.972
See, I'm sorta on his list this week,
so if it's all the same to you,

32:13.056 --> 32:16.726
I'll just consider that light
that you ran to still be amber.

32:16.809 --> 32:18.770
It was red, Renko!

32:18.853 --> 32:21.773
I made an illegal left-hand turn
between 4:00 and 7:00

32:21.856 --> 32:23.733
and I made an illegal U-turn.

32:23.816 --> 32:27.320
-Now, come on, give me the ticket.
-You want a ticket?

32:27.403 --> 32:28.404
Yes!

32:29.364 --> 32:32.075
Ma'am, may I ask you why it is
that you would want a ticket?

32:32.450 --> 32:34.327
Because I want to go to court to fight it.

32:34.410 --> 32:37.163
You want to go to court and fight it?

32:38.164 --> 32:39.040
Yes.

32:41.501 --> 32:43.878
Well, how about
if I don't give you a ticket?

32:43.962 --> 32:47.048
Then you don't have to go to court
and fight nothing.

32:47.131 --> 32:49.842
Listen, mister. I got a 5:00 manicure.

32:49.926 --> 32:52.303
So you just start writing that ticket.

32:52.804 --> 32:55.932
(jack whirring)

32:57.016 --> 32:58.851
-Richard Brady?
-Yeah?

32:59.268 --> 33:00.937
Lt. Henry Goldblume. Hill Street.

33:01.354 --> 33:05.400
Boy, one unpaid parking ticket,
you guys send out the big guns.

33:05.483 --> 33:07.610
I'm afraid it's a bit more serious
than that, son.

33:08.277 --> 33:10.196
I'd like to talk with you
about Mary Hicks.

33:10.738 --> 33:13.449
What about her? Is she all right?

33:14.617 --> 33:16.744
Well, actually,
she's presently upset, Richard.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.788
She's filed a complaint about you.

33:18.871 --> 33:19.872
About me?

33:21.791 --> 33:22.959
(sighs)

33:26.504 --> 33:27.547
I should've guessed.

33:31.342 --> 33:34.554
You know, Lieutenant, some girls
really don't know how to handle rejection.

33:34.887 --> 33:36.055
(scoffs)

33:36.139 --> 33:38.016
I moved out on her about two weeks ago.

33:38.766 --> 33:41.060
And ever since then,
she's made life a living hell for me.

33:42.020 --> 33:45.898
She's been calling me up at work, at home,
even in the middle of the night.

33:45.982 --> 33:48.609
According to Miss Hicks,
it was she who asked you to move out.

33:48.693 --> 33:51.696
According to Miss Hicks,
you were harassing her.

33:51.946 --> 33:53.406
Let me tell you something, Lieutenant.

33:53.698 --> 33:55.742
Mary's a really nice girl, I mean that.

33:56.242 --> 33:58.202
She's got some really fine qualities.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.455
But telling the truth ain't one of 'em.

34:00.747 --> 34:02.999
She said you stopped her
in front of her house this afternoon

34:03.082 --> 34:04.876
and threatened her with a hunting knife.

34:04.959 --> 34:07.253
Oh, man. (chuckles)

34:07.628 --> 34:09.088
And you believed that garbage?

34:09.881 --> 34:11.132
You want to know the truth?

34:11.591 --> 34:13.342
I stopped by her place
for about two minutes

34:13.426 --> 34:15.136
to pick up this lousy light over here.

34:15.219 --> 34:19.057
And when she started
getting all weird with me, I split.

34:19.140 --> 34:22.268
I'm telling you, man,
the girl's a little warped upstairs.

34:24.437 --> 34:25.813
I moved out on her.

34:25.897 --> 34:29.150
Then there's no reason for you
to be having any further contact with her.

34:29.233 --> 34:30.777
Why don't you tell her that, pal?

34:30.860 --> 34:32.653
She's the one that's got the problem.

34:34.030 --> 34:35.448
Thank you for your time, Richard.

34:38.409 --> 34:39.410
Hey.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.582
Are you putting it to her? Is that it?

34:45.208 --> 34:47.502
Is she getting a little cop action
on the side?

34:47.585 --> 34:48.878
Just stay away from her!

34:48.961 --> 34:51.214
You got grounds for an arrest,
you go for it, pal.

34:51.297 --> 34:53.341
Otherwise butt the hell out, you hear me?

34:58.638 --> 35:01.057
-(glass shattering)
-(men shouting)

35:02.850 --> 35:05.353
(grunting)

35:09.357 --> 35:10.858
This sucker's strong!

35:21.828 --> 35:24.705
Somebody wanna get some cuffs out, please?

35:26.999 --> 35:29.001
-You got him? Yeah!
-Yeah.

35:29.085 --> 35:31.546
(grunting)

35:33.756 --> 35:36.467
First a wacky survivalist and now this.

35:36.717 --> 35:38.761
What are we, the suicide squad?

35:39.137 --> 35:40.555
A piece of cake, Luce.

35:43.933 --> 35:47.562
The charges against you are significant,
Mr. Patrakis,

35:48.020 --> 35:49.814
but your record's clean
and you've pretty much

35:49.897 --> 35:51.816
been a model citizen in a lot of ways.

35:51.899 --> 35:54.569
I can probably get you probation
and a fine.

35:54.652 --> 35:57.363
Listen, they've confiscated my weapons.

35:58.489 --> 35:59.740
I need my weapons.

35:59.824 --> 36:02.910
-Did you have permits for any of them?
-Permits?

36:03.327 --> 36:04.662
All right, what good is paper gonna be

36:04.745 --> 36:06.998
when people start looting
and burning the town halls?

36:07.081 --> 36:11.627
Your preliminary is scheduled for 9:30
tomorrow morning with Judge Marshall.

36:12.044 --> 36:15.256
Listen, my life is in danger
in this building.

36:15.339 --> 36:17.508
Can't you see that? I mean...

36:19.760 --> 36:23.055
Oh, you see?

36:23.264 --> 36:25.641
See, it's vulnerable to attack
from the north side.

36:26.934 --> 36:29.520
You see, they could...
they could come in the ducts.

36:31.230 --> 36:32.899
All right, it's obvious that no one
has planned

36:32.982 --> 36:34.817
for the unthinkable around here.

36:34.901 --> 36:37.904
Mr. Patrakis, you're charged
with 15 felony counts,

36:37.987 --> 36:40.114
any one of which
can put you in jail for a year.

36:40.198 --> 36:42.283
If you cooperate with me,
there's a chance you'll go home

36:42.366 --> 36:44.285
with nothing more than
a slap on the wrist.

36:44.368 --> 36:46.621
But if you insist on behaving
the way you have been,

36:46.704 --> 36:49.957
if you keep talking on in rambling,
paranoiac fantasies--

36:50.041 --> 36:51.292
Do you know what's missing?

36:51.667 --> 36:52.835
Do you know what's missing in modern man?

36:52.919 --> 36:54.754
I'm gonna tell you what's missing
in modern man

36:54.837 --> 36:56.547
is not the will to survive,

36:57.715 --> 37:01.260
but the very idea to survive.

37:01.344 --> 37:02.428
Don't you see--

37:04.639 --> 37:06.641
Okay, all right, all right, all right.

37:06.724 --> 37:09.769
Let's just say you get in your car
and you drive out to the desert.

37:10.895 --> 37:14.023
It breaks down 30 miles
from the nearest water.

37:14.106 --> 37:15.775
It's 105 degrees in the shade.

37:16.192 --> 37:19.570
And you have nothing with you
but what you had in your pockets

37:19.987 --> 37:21.405
when you first got in your car.

37:21.822 --> 37:24.784
All right, question-- how do you survive?

37:26.410 --> 37:30.039
First, I'd stay with the car,
wait for night.

37:30.122 --> 37:33.876
Then I'd siphon off gasoline from the tank
and set the spare on fire.

37:33.960 --> 37:37.171
Nice black, oily smoke,
just in case somebody might see it.

37:38.256 --> 37:41.133
I wouldn't take cover
from the sun in the car, too exposed.

37:41.217 --> 37:44.095
I'd get under it.
Close it off with rags, sand, anything.

37:44.887 --> 37:47.640
I'd save my urine to cool my exposed skin

37:47.723 --> 37:49.225
and do what I could to get some sleep.

37:49.308 --> 37:51.519
At sundown,
I'd tear the fabric off the car seats

37:51.602 --> 37:53.521
for protection against the night cold,

37:53.604 --> 37:56.649
then start cross-country
using the north star as a guide.

37:56.732 --> 38:00.611
I'd keep a nice, even pace,
so I wouldn't get blisters

38:00.695 --> 38:02.947
or maybe sprain an ankle in the dark.

38:04.156 --> 38:05.950
Now you tell me, mister,
what you're going to do

38:06.033 --> 38:08.786
to keep yourself alive in that courtroom
tomorrow morning.

38:12.206 --> 38:13.207
You.

38:15.334 --> 38:17.420
-You're the first.
-The first what?

38:18.587 --> 38:20.548
The first of 50 women

38:21.215 --> 38:25.261
destined to perpetuate the species
and save civilization as we know it.

38:25.344 --> 38:27.972
(laughs)

38:28.931 --> 38:32.935
You see, I have this refrigerator at home.

38:35.521 --> 38:38.274
Get on down there! Move it!

38:38.357 --> 38:40.776
Get on down there
or I'll knock you in the face!

38:40.860 --> 38:42.903
-The Donleavy perpetrator?
-Yes, sir.

38:42.987 --> 38:44.697
You people are batting a thousand today.

38:44.780 --> 38:46.490
-Thank you.
-LaRue!

38:50.328 --> 38:51.329
Howard?

38:51.912 --> 38:54.790
Chief, it was good to see you
back out on the street, sir.

38:54.874 --> 38:56.375
Thank you, Howard. Feeling great.

38:56.459 --> 38:57.835
(phone ringing)

38:58.711 --> 39:01.630
-Ah, Frank.
-Chief.

39:02.381 --> 39:05.551
I want to give your man an attaboy, Frank.
Want to do it in front of you.

39:05.968 --> 39:07.887
The man's stepped on his
private parts so often,

39:07.970 --> 39:09.305
when he does something right we ought to--

39:09.388 --> 39:11.849
-Uh, sir?
-Well...

39:12.767 --> 39:16.145
-Good for you, John LaRue.
-Thank you, sir.

39:16.228 --> 39:19.023
Did you follow the trail of blood?
Was that how you found--

39:19.106 --> 39:21.317
Oh, oh, the rat. Yeah, yep. Yeah, it was.

39:21.400 --> 39:23.319
It was the one, definitely.

39:23.402 --> 39:25.071
The sucker was limping like crazy.

39:25.154 --> 39:28.074
-I knew I winged the bugger!
-RAY: Excuse me.

39:28.157 --> 39:30.618
We just got word
from the Health Department, Chief.

39:30.701 --> 39:34.288
-Ray, that cannot be an accurate report.
-What report?

39:34.372 --> 39:37.917
The laboratory says
that the rat that bit you was rabid.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.127
-Rabid?
-HOWARD: It's highly unlikely.

39:40.503 --> 39:42.838
Hydrophobia is the next thing
to being eliminated.

39:42.922 --> 39:46.592
In addition to which, it's only carried
by creatures of the wild.

39:47.009 --> 39:49.220
Unless this rodent was a commuter.

39:49.303 --> 39:52.932
The laboratory says you are to begin
injections immediately, Chief.

39:53.349 --> 39:56.811
-Time is very important.
-Injections?

39:56.894 --> 39:58.354
(phone ringing)

39:59.855 --> 40:03.109
It used to be 14 of them
right into the solar plexus,

40:03.192 --> 40:04.819
with a needle about that long.

40:04.902 --> 40:07.446
-It was like a pole vault!
-Howard. (clears throat)

40:07.530 --> 40:10.282
Of course, things may
have improved by now.

40:11.492 --> 40:14.453
I hate needles.
Ever since I was a little boy.

40:14.537 --> 40:17.415
Well, that's my point.
They should re-autopsy that rat.

40:17.498 --> 40:21.168
I mean, putting a man
like this through that sort of pain.

40:21.252 --> 40:22.545
Where am I supposed to go?

40:22.628 --> 40:25.172
They have taken the vaccine
to your doctor.

40:25.256 --> 40:26.966
He's waiting for you at his office.

40:29.385 --> 40:31.429
Well, better safe than sorry.

40:31.720 --> 40:33.639
-(chuckles)
-Hell of a note, eh, Frank?

40:33.722 --> 40:35.766
(clears throat) Hell of a note, Chief.

40:42.273 --> 40:43.649
You saved my life, LaRue.

40:45.359 --> 40:46.527
My pleasure, sir.

40:55.953 --> 40:57.496
Check your gun, Lieutenant?

41:02.460 --> 41:05.254
-Hear you got that rape pinch here, huh?
-Yes, sir.

41:05.838 --> 41:06.839
Good.

41:15.097 --> 41:18.225
-Hi, Jack.
-You got him, eh, Frank?

41:18.476 --> 41:19.643
Yeah, we got him.

41:21.270 --> 41:24.857
-Uh, just give the whole thing to Phil.
-All right.

41:25.983 --> 41:26.984
Hi, Jack.

41:36.869 --> 41:38.871
-He give you a fight?
-A little bit.

41:38.954 --> 41:40.289
How's Kathleen feeling?

41:40.831 --> 41:44.418
She's had a shock. She's had a trauma.

41:46.170 --> 41:49.507
Why don't you stay with her, Jack?
There's nothing for you here.

41:50.382 --> 41:51.550
We've both had a trauma.

41:53.093 --> 41:55.095
That's what Father Driscoll
tries to explain.

41:56.472 --> 41:58.974
We've had an assault
on our flesh and our spirit.

42:00.100 --> 42:01.894
It's gonna take us time to get over it.

42:02.311 --> 42:04.313
How long has it been since you've slept?

42:05.940 --> 42:07.525
This is a beautiful girl.

42:08.943 --> 42:10.486
This was a beautiful girl.

42:11.153 --> 42:12.821
I could show you communion pictures,

42:12.905 --> 42:14.907
you'd say,
"Who's that little angel there?"

42:15.783 --> 42:16.784
Seriously.

42:25.668 --> 42:28.587
No, I'm serious, Frank. You'd say,
"Who's that little angel there?"

42:28.671 --> 42:29.964
Why don't you go home, Jack?

42:30.589 --> 42:32.049
Oh, yeah, I gotta go.

42:33.592 --> 42:35.553
I'm not any good to her
without my strength.

42:35.928 --> 42:36.929
That's right.

42:39.640 --> 42:41.517
That's what the Father
wants me to realize.

43:21.849 --> 43:23.475
Huh, what?

43:24.643 --> 43:25.978
Huh?

43:29.189 --> 43:30.816
PATRAKIS: What? (screams)

43:30.899 --> 43:34.111
-(gunfire)
-MAN: Don't move!

43:37.197 --> 43:38.741
Put 'em down.

43:38.824 --> 43:40.826
(clamoring)

43:40.909 --> 43:43.579
-My keys!
-LUCY: God, it's the survivor.

43:43.662 --> 43:45.539
The poor jerk shot the wrong guy.

43:50.628 --> 43:53.672
-Hey, how about that survivalist guy?
-Patrakis?

43:55.424 --> 43:58.719
You know, it's like one time,
we went to visit my uncle's grave,

43:59.178 --> 44:01.764
a couple of stones down,
there was this inscription,

44:02.306 --> 44:04.683
-"Now will you believe I'm sick?"
-(chuckles)

44:04.767 --> 44:05.976
What's the connection?

44:07.811 --> 44:10.230
This guy's been telling everybody
how dangerous life is

44:10.314 --> 44:12.024
and he gets blown away in jail.

44:12.858 --> 44:14.276
Cut it out! You know
what I'm talking about.

44:14.360 --> 44:15.694
-(giggling)
-All you do is--

44:16.236 --> 44:17.154
Thank you.

44:17.237 --> 44:19.073
So, what do you think? You like the place?

44:19.156 --> 44:20.157
It's nice.

44:26.080 --> 44:27.998
Yeah, it's a place to go.

44:29.541 --> 44:32.169
Have a few brewskis. Decompress.

44:32.378 --> 44:35.756
Ooh! I ordered rye.
She gave me the wrong shot.

44:35.839 --> 44:39.593
She's kinda the Jack Donleavy
of barmaids, huh?

44:41.136 --> 44:43.013
Is that your idea of a sense of humor?

44:43.097 --> 44:45.140
-That was funny.
-I mean, that's a real sick remark.

44:45.224 --> 44:48.227
-Okay, but funny.
-Hey, does Belker ever come in here?

44:49.687 --> 44:52.064
No. No, he pretty much keeps to himself.

44:52.523 --> 44:54.858
-Hey, what's doing?
-Hi, Mick.

44:54.942 --> 44:57.069
Hey! How're you doing? Sit down.

44:57.152 --> 44:58.404
-Yeah.
-Okay.

44:58.487 --> 45:01.949
-You want a drink?
-Yeah! I'll have a beer.

45:02.032 --> 45:04.034
-She'll be right back.
-LUCY: Hey, Robin.

45:04.118 --> 45:06.286
I told you this was a great place, huh?

45:06.370 --> 45:08.622
-We got a quorum now?
-JOE: How you doing?

45:08.706 --> 45:11.792
-Good.
-JOE: Hey, Angel, another draw over here!

45:24.012 --> 45:26.724
-Six o'clock.
-Mr. Benedetto.

45:26.807 --> 45:27.975
Where do you want it?

45:28.976 --> 45:31.812
Look, maybe I got a little excited
this morning, you know?

45:31.895 --> 45:32.980
And maybe you being a cop and all,

45:33.063 --> 45:35.733
I coulda figured some way
to eat that ticket.

45:35.816 --> 45:38.402
-(sighs)
-Look, I got a problem, Mr. Benedetto.

45:38.485 --> 45:40.946
I'm trying to get my emotional age up
to the double digits.

45:41.029 --> 45:43.073
Hey, when do you wet yourself, huh?

45:43.157 --> 45:44.950
When do you tell me about your bad heart?

45:45.033 --> 45:46.452
I'm trying to get us disengaged.

45:46.535 --> 45:49.621
Listen, you're a fat-mouth faggot,
and I'm gonna take your head off.

45:51.123 --> 45:52.166
Outside.

45:57.629 --> 46:00.716
One of these days I'm gonna learn
how to offend a better class of people.

46:01.008 --> 46:03.218
(groans)

46:04.136 --> 46:05.345
You suckered me, man.

46:05.429 --> 46:07.556
Yeah? Tell me about it.

46:07.848 --> 46:10.517
(both grunting)

46:11.185 --> 46:12.603
Write me a letter.

46:18.275 --> 46:21.862
All right, Country.
You want to give me another ticket?

46:29.745 --> 46:32.372
(car door opens, closes)

46:36.043 --> 46:37.669
-Frank?
-Hmm?

46:39.713 --> 46:41.715
I've been invited to interview for a job.

46:42.341 --> 46:43.884
Wonderful. What is it?

46:45.344 --> 46:46.720
With the Justice Department.

46:47.513 --> 46:49.973
I have to fly down
to Washington tomorrow afternoon.

46:52.643 --> 46:54.019
It's kind of sudden, isn't it?

46:56.063 --> 46:57.981
It only just came up this morning.

46:59.107 --> 47:00.859
Clark's very excited about it.

47:01.401 --> 47:03.612
He says they have to fill
the position by Monday.

47:05.489 --> 47:07.866
I wasn't sure I could work out
the logistics.

47:09.576 --> 47:14.414
In a ghoulish way, that poor survivalist
getting killed cleared the decks for me.

47:15.165 --> 47:16.166
Who's Clark?

47:18.001 --> 47:19.253
I told you about him.

47:20.003 --> 47:22.172
He taught me Procedure in law school.

47:22.464 --> 47:23.382
Ah.

47:24.508 --> 47:25.509
Remember?

47:28.262 --> 47:30.639
Oh, uh, yeah, I think so.

47:30.722 --> 47:32.724
You must've made quite
an impression on him.

47:33.684 --> 47:35.561
For him to keep you in mind all this time.

47:35.644 --> 47:37.604
(laughs)

47:40.065 --> 47:42.109
Actually, it was the other way around.

47:43.151 --> 47:45.571
I think every girl in the class
had a crush on him.

47:46.405 --> 47:49.032
Hmm? Was the crush reciprocated?

47:52.703 --> 47:53.912
-You're jealous.
-Yes.

47:57.040 --> 47:59.585
-He was married.
-Is he still?

48:00.085 --> 48:01.378
-What?
-Married.

48:02.588 --> 48:05.507
I didn't ask. It didn't come up.

48:07.843 --> 48:10.053
I just wish you hadn't sprung it on me
like this.

48:11.179 --> 48:12.764
Frank, it only just happened.

48:13.223 --> 48:14.808
Well, what if you get the job?

48:16.560 --> 48:17.978
I'm not going to do anything

48:18.061 --> 48:20.439
until I talk it over with you first,
Pizza Man.

48:22.941 --> 48:26.278
(sighs) Probably won't get it, anyway.

48:26.361 --> 48:27.362
Probably will.

48:34.161 --> 48:36.997
(closing theme playing)
