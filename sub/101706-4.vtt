WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:01.918
Previously on SWAT...

00:02.001 --> 00:03.336
Did you know Tan and Street
were signing up?

00:03.420 --> 00:04.421
Why did you both sign up
for TLI?

00:04.504 --> 00:06.464
I told you guys two weeks ago
I was going for it.

00:06.548 --> 00:10.468
Is it a big deal?

00:06.548 --> 00:10.468
I don't love competing
against my teammates.

00:10.552 --> 00:12.095
You're not seriously worried
about beating them, are you?

00:12.178 --> 00:13.638
I know how good they are.

00:13.722 --> 00:15.348
Tan's got one more cadre
than me.

00:15.432 --> 00:17.976
Street's been central
to huge undercover ops.

00:18.059 --> 00:19.477
They don't feel like friends
right now.

00:19.561 --> 00:21.479
I'm looking at
early parole, man.

00:21.563 --> 00:23.064
I thought you had six,
seven more years at least.

00:23.148 --> 00:25.608
I gotta go before the board
in two days.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.152
That's why I called you here.

00:27.235 --> 00:28.653
You want me to speak
on your behalf.

00:28.737 --> 00:29.779
I just got out of class

00:29.863 --> 00:30.947
and got a collect
call from prison.

00:31.030 --> 00:31.823
Your pop.

00:31.030 --> 00:31.823
Yeah.

00:31.906 --> 00:32.991
He said he might be
getting out early.

00:33.074 --> 00:35.160
He said you're gonna help him
with his parole hearing.

00:35.243 --> 00:37.287
I am not gonna speak on his
behalf at the parole hearing.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.372
Leroy, I wish you luck, man,

00:39.456 --> 00:41.499
but you're gonna have to do this
thing without my recommendation.

00:41.583 --> 00:44.419
Yo, we ain't done, man.

00:46.087 --> 00:47.589
(siren blaring)

00:47.672 --> 00:49.299
(tires screeching)

01:00.810 --> 01:01.853
DISPATCHER (over radio):
Do not enter off Bruckman.

01:01.936 --> 01:04.105
Take Anza Drive
to the back entrance.

01:04.189 --> 01:05.732
Roger that. Over.

01:19.913 --> 01:20.955
Come on.

01:22.248 --> 01:24.042
(siren wailing)

01:24.125 --> 01:26.795
(tires screeching)

01:46.397 --> 01:48.233
(tires screech)

02:03.957 --> 02:05.375
Good job.

02:05.458 --> 02:07.544
Man, I don't know.

02:07.627 --> 02:09.212
You worried you hit a curb or
something? I think you're good.

02:09.295 --> 02:10.880
Yeah. Wasn't he
five seconds under?

02:09.295 --> 02:10.880
CHRIS: I didn't notice.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.091
Some of these evaluators
are hard-asses.

02:13.174 --> 02:15.510
No telling what they're
gonna deduct points for.

02:20.473 --> 02:22.100
You passed.

02:20.473 --> 02:22.100
(grunts)

02:22.183 --> 02:24.602
Told you.

02:22.183 --> 02:24.602
(applause, cheers)

02:24.686 --> 02:26.104
Way to crush it.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.104
Told you.

02:26.187 --> 02:28.106
Attaboy.

02:26.187 --> 02:28.106
Not bad.

02:28.189 --> 02:31.568
Not bad?
Two cadres in two months?

02:31.651 --> 02:35.613
He's making the TLI
competition a real contest.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.115
I'll worry about
my own stuff.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.452
Is something
going on with her?

02:41.536 --> 02:42.787
TAN:
You better get with
the program, player.

02:42.871 --> 02:44.080
TLI's mine.

02:44.163 --> 02:45.623
I'm starting to smell victory.

02:45.707 --> 02:47.542
All right, all right, all right.
Congratulations.

02:47.625 --> 02:48.751
That's all you got?

02:48.835 --> 02:50.128
You afraid to talk
a little trash now?

02:50.211 --> 02:52.213
Like I said, congratulations.

02:59.262 --> 03:01.723
Damn, it's about time
you woke up, youngster.

03:01.806 --> 03:03.808
Hey, don't forget you got
that Junior College Expo today.

03:03.892 --> 03:06.227
Yeah, everything I need
I got; it's in my bag.

03:03.892 --> 03:06.227
All right.

03:06.311 --> 03:08.229
Hey, Pops, you still good
to drive him, right?

03:08.313 --> 03:10.273
I sure am.

03:08.313 --> 03:10.273
All right, cool.

03:10.356 --> 03:13.234
My team's running point at
the Rhodium memorial tomorrow,

03:13.318 --> 03:15.069
which means things could
get a little crazy.

03:15.153 --> 03:16.613
It says here that
they're selling tickets

03:16.696 --> 03:17.989
to this woman's funeral?

03:18.072 --> 03:20.158
Yeah, everything sold out
in under a minute.

03:20.241 --> 03:21.618
Yeah, there's not a lot
of seats available.

03:21.701 --> 03:22.952
Everybody else has to watch

03:23.036 --> 03:24.162
the procession from the street.

03:24.245 --> 03:26.497
27 years old. What a shame.

03:26.581 --> 03:28.124
I also read something that said
if she would have took

03:28.207 --> 03:29.125
a yearly physical,
they could have caught

03:29.208 --> 03:31.294
the heart defect
that killed her.

03:31.377 --> 03:33.922
It's not weird for you?

03:34.005 --> 03:36.382
You know, guarding
Rhodium's memorial?

03:36.466 --> 03:38.509
Especially with everything
she said about the police.

03:38.593 --> 03:39.802
HONDO:
You know, D...

03:41.471 --> 03:43.139
...a lot of people are saying
a lot of stuff

03:43.222 --> 03:45.058
about the police lately,

03:45.141 --> 03:46.309
and a lot of it is true.

03:46.392 --> 03:49.479
As long as I keep doing things
the right way, and I make sure

03:49.562 --> 03:50.855
the cops I work with do, too,

03:50.939 --> 03:52.982
and we stay true
to the community,

03:53.066 --> 03:55.026
I just don't let it bother me.

03:55.109 --> 03:57.153
And as far as Rhodium,
I heard some things.

03:57.236 --> 03:59.364
But it just makes me think
that she must have had reasons

03:59.447 --> 04:01.282
to feel the way she did.

04:01.366 --> 04:02.659
(knocking at door)

04:02.742 --> 04:04.243
You expecting somebody?

04:14.420 --> 04:15.964
Leroy.

04:16.047 --> 04:17.548
You look surprised.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.133
I heard you got out.

04:19.217 --> 04:22.845
Yeah, yeah, no thanks to you.

04:19.217 --> 04:22.845
I just thought

04:22.929 --> 04:24.514
you might call first,
that's all.

04:24.597 --> 04:27.433
You gonna invite me in or what?

04:29.978 --> 04:31.020
Dad.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.063
Hello. Ha ha.

04:32.146 --> 04:35.149
You're looking good, boy. Huh?

04:35.233 --> 04:37.902
What, Hondo got you
hitting the weights?

04:35.233 --> 04:37.902
A little bit.

04:37.986 --> 04:38.903
A little bit.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.363
Yeah, yeah, I see
a little something there.

04:40.446 --> 04:42.365
You wouldn't know it
to look at us now,

04:42.448 --> 04:44.367
but, uh, I taught Hondo

04:44.450 --> 04:47.036
everything he knows
about lifting.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.413
Mr. Harrelson,
it's good to see you.

04:48.496 --> 04:51.374
I heard about the cancer.
Keep up the fight.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.835
Oh, don't worry,
I ain't got no quit in me.

04:53.918 --> 04:56.004
Yeah, I know, I know.

04:53.918 --> 04:56.004
(laughs)

04:56.087 --> 04:58.047
So you just got out a couple of
days ago, is that right?

04:58.131 --> 04:59.549
Yeah, yeah, I would
have come right by,

04:59.632 --> 05:02.343
but, uh, they had me
doing orientation

05:02.427 --> 05:04.387
at the halfway house, you know.

05:05.346 --> 05:07.473
You got time for a bite?

05:07.557 --> 05:09.350
Right now?

05:09.434 --> 05:11.686
I asked you, not him.

05:13.646 --> 05:16.566
Leroy, Darryl's got
a college expo today at 11:00.

05:16.649 --> 05:18.067
Well, that sounds
like that gives us

05:18.151 --> 05:20.862
plenty of time, then,
to grab a little breakfast.

05:22.864 --> 05:24.782
All right, well, listen,
if you can get him back by 10:00

05:24.866 --> 05:27.577
so Pops can get him to that
expo, then I guess it's cool.

05:27.660 --> 05:28.786
Ten's kind of early, man.
I mean,

05:28.870 --> 05:30.788
where's this expo at, Arizona?

05:30.872 --> 05:31.789
(Darryl chuckles)

05:31.873 --> 05:34.208
Look, bro, uh...

05:34.292 --> 05:36.919
this is my first chance in years

05:37.003 --> 05:40.590
to spend time with my son
as a free man.

05:40.673 --> 05:41.466
Leroy, you two are gonna have

05:41.549 --> 05:42.800
plenty of chances to get
acquainted.

05:42.884 --> 05:44.594
If things go well
at that expo today,

05:44.677 --> 05:45.928
you might be getting lunch
with him

05:46.012 --> 05:48.431
in a college cafeteria
next year.

05:50.391 --> 05:54.270
Hey, my friend T.C. is also
going to the expo, too.

05:54.353 --> 05:56.481
I bet he can swing by and
pick us up wherever we're at.

05:56.564 --> 05:57.607
There you go.

05:57.690 --> 05:59.567
All right.

05:59.650 --> 06:01.152
All right,
but don't you be late.

06:01.235 --> 06:02.236
All right, I won't.
I promise.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.946
I'll meet you there and
I'll drive you back home.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.573
I'm just gonna go get my stuff.

06:05.656 --> 06:06.657
All right.
I'll be out front.

06:06.741 --> 06:08.785
All right.

06:12.246 --> 06:15.458
I'll be seeing you around,
Hondo.

06:17.210 --> 06:20.463
Mr. Harrelson.

06:22.090 --> 06:24.133
(door opens)

06:27.220 --> 06:29.180
(door closes)

06:31.015 --> 06:32.016
HICKS:
This Rhodium memorial's

06:32.100 --> 06:34.811
got everyone's eyes on us,
which means

06:34.894 --> 06:37.021
we're gonna have to deal with
more politics than usual.

06:37.105 --> 06:38.648
High-profile event.
I get it.

06:38.731 --> 06:41.818
Good, 'cause Rhodium Spender's
mother's coming here at 1:30,

06:41.901 --> 06:43.778
and I need you and Hondo
to do some hand-holding.

06:43.861 --> 06:45.488
My plate's full.

06:45.571 --> 06:46.656
We gotta do a final walk-through
of the procession route,

06:46.739 --> 06:47.490
but we should be back by then.

06:47.573 --> 06:50.451
Look, there's a lot
of people wondering

06:50.535 --> 06:52.870
how the LAPD's gonna treat
the family of someone

06:52.954 --> 06:54.539
as hard on the police
as Rhodium was.

06:54.622 --> 06:56.040
Commander, you know that we're
taking this as seriously

06:56.124 --> 06:57.792
as we would any event
of this scale.

06:56.124 --> 06:57.792
Yeah.

06:57.875 --> 07:00.336
I know that,
but not everyone does.

07:00.419 --> 07:03.214
Millions of people are gonna
be watching this on television.

07:03.297 --> 07:06.259
Good.
They'll see us at our best.

07:09.804 --> 07:13.224
We do checks on any of these
second-story locations?

07:13.307 --> 07:14.350
Rocker's team's handling it.

07:14.433 --> 07:15.434
All right, let's get
confirmation.

07:15.518 --> 07:17.562
Anybody on the route
with higher than ground-floor

07:17.645 --> 07:18.437
windows.

07:17.645 --> 07:18.437
I'm on it.

07:18.521 --> 07:19.730
Street, there's still
a lot of cars

07:19.814 --> 07:21.190
in the no-parking areas.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.150
Tows are coming tonight.

07:22.233 --> 07:23.609
CHRIS:
Think anybody would be
stupid enough

07:23.693 --> 07:25.361
to go after this memorial?

07:25.444 --> 07:26.696
L.A. loves Rhodium.

07:25.444 --> 07:26.696
HONDO:
There's a lot of people

07:26.779 --> 07:28.531
still pissed off about
what she did on that show.

07:28.614 --> 07:29.699
Can you blame 'em?

07:29.782 --> 07:32.201
Giant screen on stage showing
all the names and photos

07:32.285 --> 07:33.578
of unarmed people
killed by the police.

07:33.661 --> 07:35.538
She could have at least had
half the screen

07:35.621 --> 07:36.539
showing the names
of police officers

07:36.622 --> 07:37.331
killed in the line of duty.

07:37.415 --> 07:38.291
Aw, come on, Deac,
name a celebrity

07:38.374 --> 07:40.710
who doesn't get on
a soapbox now and then.

07:40.793 --> 07:41.878
More like jumped on
the bandwagon.

07:41.961 --> 07:42.795
Not a word until the protests,

07:42.879 --> 07:44.422
and then it's all about
defund the police.

07:44.505 --> 07:46.340
Maybe she wasn't saying
defund the police before,

07:46.424 --> 07:48.342
but she definitely spoke out
against bad police shootings.

07:48.426 --> 07:50.052
And she put her money
where her mouth was.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.180
Did a lot for the neighborhood
after she made it.

07:52.263 --> 07:54.015
Not to mention
her music's awesome.

07:54.098 --> 07:56.058
There's a reason the crowd's
gonna be huge.

07:56.142 --> 07:56.893
All right, guys, come on.

07:56.976 --> 07:58.936
That's enough.
Everybody's had their say.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.897
Deacon, Chris, help me
check the outer perimeter.

08:00.980 --> 08:03.232
Tan, Street, check
the exit routes.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.443
(train horn blares)

08:07.445 --> 08:10.072
So, dude, what's up
with the TLI competition?

08:10.156 --> 08:11.616
I didn't see the spark
in your eye this morning

08:11.699 --> 08:13.868
at the motor pool.

08:11.699 --> 08:13.868
Is this you talking
more trash?

08:13.951 --> 08:15.119
No, for real.

08:15.203 --> 08:16.245
How come you're acting
like you don't care

08:16.329 --> 08:17.747
if you win or lose?

08:17.830 --> 08:19.749
Well, I mean, losing TLI
wouldn't be the worst thing

08:19.832 --> 08:21.083
that ever happened to me.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.377
CHRIS (over radio):
Hondo, I found something.

08:30.218 --> 08:31.969
Is that what I think it is?

08:30.218 --> 08:31.969
AR-15.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.804
They probably hid it here
ahead of time

08:33.888 --> 08:34.805
because they knew they couldn't
get it past

08:34.889 --> 08:37.058
the checkpoints tomorrow.

08:34.889 --> 08:37.058
Is this the only one?

08:37.141 --> 08:38.267
It was so well hidden
I almost missed it.

08:38.351 --> 08:41.020
Could be more out there.

08:54.492 --> 08:57.328
Last thing the city
needs right now.

08:57.411 --> 08:59.622
Yeah, well, it's not gonna
happen on our watch.

09:02.708 --> 09:04.252
Get some unis up here
to help clear

09:04.335 --> 09:06.087
the rest of the areas,
then meet me back at HQ.

A week before Rhodium's death,
she had to reschedule

09:50.464 --> 09:51.632
a meeting with community leaders
in San Diego

09:51.716 --> 09:52.591
due to multiple bomb threats.

09:52.675 --> 09:54.760
Now, San Diego PD
wasn't able to pinpoint

09:54.844 --> 09:56.012
a specific computer,

09:56.095 --> 09:57.346
but they were able
to trace the threat

09:57.430 --> 09:59.515
to an IP address
right here in Los Angeles.

09:59.598 --> 10:01.392
Tan's working with our tech guys
to see if they can find

10:01.475 --> 10:03.019
anything San Diego missed.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.187
Not a smoking gun,
but at least it's something.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.315
What about the AR-15?

10:07.398 --> 10:08.733
DEACON:
Equipped with brand-new
mounting bracket,

10:08.816 --> 10:11.193
specifically for
an M203 grenade launcher.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.112
Grenade launcher? My God.

10:13.195 --> 10:15.531
HONDO:
M203s are illegal in California,
so he either bought it

10:15.615 --> 10:17.074
out of state or
was able to find

10:17.158 --> 10:18.492
a local seller willing
to skirt the law.

10:18.576 --> 10:20.536
Now, Chris has a CI
in the weapons surplus world,

10:20.620 --> 10:21.704
so she's working
that angle.

10:21.787 --> 10:23.831
Mrs. Spender.
I'm Commander Hicks.

10:23.914 --> 10:26.876
These are Sergeants
Harrelson and Kay.

10:26.959 --> 10:29.045
Sergeant Harrelson's team
is, uh, running point

10:29.128 --> 10:30.379
on security for
Rhodium's memorial.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.173
Please, call me Jillian.

10:32.256 --> 10:33.424
And you can call
my daughter Monica.

10:33.507 --> 10:34.592
Rhodium was just
her stage name.

10:34.675 --> 10:38.012
It's the name of one of
the rarest elements on Earth.

10:38.095 --> 10:39.680
And it's worth
three times as much as gold.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.724
That's right. When she
was just ten years old,

10:41.807 --> 10:44.393
soon as she learned about
rhodium in school, she said,

10:44.477 --> 10:46.062
"That's what
I'm gonna call myself

10:46.145 --> 10:48.064
when I'm a famous singer."

10:46.145 --> 10:48.064
(chuckles)

10:48.147 --> 10:49.398
Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you, Jillian.

10:49.482 --> 10:50.566
Now, our plan was to walk you

10:50.649 --> 10:51.734
through the security
arrangements

10:51.817 --> 10:55.071
for tomorrow, but the situation
seems to have changed.

10:55.154 --> 10:56.906
Yes, I was told
there's been a credible threat.

10:56.989 --> 10:58.115
I'm not surprised.

10:58.199 --> 10:59.867
Monica inspired
a lot of people,

10:59.950 --> 11:02.661
but she also
pissed a lot of people off.

11:03.537 --> 11:06.791
Any recent threats
to your daughter or her fans?

11:06.874 --> 11:08.584
She got a box of threats a day.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.544
HICKS: Well, that's exactly
the kind of information we need,

11:10.628 --> 11:12.296
especially anything
that stood out.

11:12.380 --> 11:13.839
If you'd like to
step into my...

11:13.923 --> 11:15.383
I'm sorry. I have a question.

11:15.466 --> 11:16.759
Sure.

11:16.842 --> 11:18.594
Sergeant Harrelson,

11:18.677 --> 11:20.805
your team is handling
my protection tomorrow?

11:20.888 --> 11:22.723
Yours and everyone else's,
yes, ma'am.

11:22.807 --> 11:25.059
And is Sergeant Kay
part of your team?

11:26.644 --> 11:28.229
Yes, I am. Is there a problem?

11:28.312 --> 11:30.981
Three months ago,
Monica was speaking at an event

11:31.065 --> 11:35.027
in Hollywood, and her usual
security team wasn't available.

11:35.111 --> 11:37.113
We tried to hire your company.

11:37.196 --> 11:38.739
You turned us down.

11:38.823 --> 11:40.908
Said you couldn't
in good conscience

11:40.991 --> 11:42.410
work for someone who said
the things she said

11:42.493 --> 11:43.494
about the police.

11:43.577 --> 11:45.079
So if you need to

11:45.162 --> 11:48.499
excuse yourself now,
I'd understand.

11:50.084 --> 11:51.419
That won't be necessary.

11:51.502 --> 11:53.087
HICKS: I can assure you
that Sergeant Kay

11:53.170 --> 11:54.463
will not let
his personal feelings

11:54.547 --> 11:56.799
get in the way of doing his job.

11:56.882 --> 11:58.426
He's one of the best men

11:58.509 --> 12:01.303
I've ever had
under my command.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.264
I see.

12:03.347 --> 12:05.599
Well, is there
somewhere I can sit

12:05.683 --> 12:08.185
while I detail our most recent
death threats for you?

12:08.269 --> 12:09.812
Absolutely.
We can use my office.

12:09.895 --> 12:11.188
Right this way.

12:17.862 --> 12:19.655
By the way, it's not like
I was their only option.

12:19.738 --> 12:21.449
Deacon, just try to look at it
from Jillian's perspective.

12:21.532 --> 12:22.491
Rhodium made a stand

12:22.575 --> 12:25.453
about police brutality,
but not all police, Deac.

12:25.536 --> 12:26.787
In her mind,

12:26.871 --> 12:27.997
if you got a problem with that,

12:28.080 --> 12:29.165
then maybe you're
part of the problem.

12:29.248 --> 12:30.499
I'm part of the problem?

12:30.583 --> 12:32.042
(sighs)

12:33.919 --> 12:35.838
It's not just that.

12:35.921 --> 12:39.341
It's this whole
"defund the police" nonsense.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.177
Not exactly
the thanks we deserve

12:41.260 --> 12:43.137
for going out there
and risking our lives every day.

12:43.220 --> 12:45.389
And to her, it might be just
something that she's chanting,

12:45.473 --> 12:48.517
but a thing like that changes
the way people look at us.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.019
It makes our job harder.

12:50.102 --> 12:51.395
And I hear you,
and that is one truth.

12:51.479 --> 12:53.189
There's also
another truth, man.

12:53.272 --> 12:54.690
We got guns on our hips.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.358
We got the power
to end a life.

12:56.442 --> 12:57.902
Look, maybe
it doesn't hurt

12:57.985 --> 12:59.904
to have some people out there
holding us all accountable.

12:59.987 --> 13:02.281
Are you trying to calm me down
or-or make me angrier?

13:02.364 --> 13:04.241
Deacon, you and I both know
that sometimes we get asked

13:04.325 --> 13:06.744
to take on problems where
there's no one right answer.

13:06.827 --> 13:09.038
What Rhodium was
talking about is

13:09.121 --> 13:11.999
maybe some things
can be solved without a gun.

13:12.082 --> 13:13.375
(sighs)

13:13.459 --> 13:15.044
I don't like the mom implying

13:15.127 --> 13:18.214
that I won't go out there
and do my job tomorrow.

13:18.297 --> 13:20.049
Take a bullet
just like anybody else.

13:20.132 --> 13:22.051
Okay, so then you get out there
and you prove her wrong.

13:22.134 --> 13:24.136
(phone chimes)

13:22.134 --> 13:24.136
Without the taking
the bullet part.

13:25.262 --> 13:26.388
Looks like Tan and Street

13:26.472 --> 13:28.224
might have found something.
Let's move.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.397
We've been looking into
the list of threats

13:35.481 --> 13:37.024
that Rhodium's mom got us;
good number of them

13:37.107 --> 13:38.108
link back to
the Blue Boys.

13:38.192 --> 13:39.235
HICKS: Yeah,
I've heard of them.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.111
Can't stop talking about
how much they love the police

13:41.195 --> 13:42.571
and happy to break the law
to prove it.

13:42.655 --> 13:45.032
The Blue Boys
doxed Rhodium a while back.

13:45.115 --> 13:46.617
They found her home address,

13:46.700 --> 13:48.536
put it out on the Internet
so all the haters

13:48.619 --> 13:50.371
could send nasty stuff
right to her front door.

13:50.454 --> 13:51.789
Plus, you might have noticed
the murals of Rhodium

13:51.872 --> 13:53.415
that have been popping
up all over the city.

13:53.499 --> 13:56.210
These guys are defacing them
as fast as they can find them.

13:56.293 --> 13:57.795
It's a pretty big leap
from vandalism to threats

13:57.878 --> 13:59.088
to shooting grenades
at a crowd of innocents.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.215
Well, a lot of times,
groups like this have

14:01.298 --> 14:02.925
rogue members who don't feel
the group's extreme enough.

14:03.008 --> 14:03.926
TAN:
There's a new mural nearby.

14:04.009 --> 14:04.927
Somebody put it up

14:05.010 --> 14:07.054
on the Blue Boys' social
media site this morning.

14:07.137 --> 14:09.765
We figure we camp out on it,
maybe we see who stops by.

14:09.848 --> 14:11.058
Keep me updated.

14:11.141 --> 14:12.935
I got everyone with
a city hall e-mail address

14:13.018 --> 14:14.395
all over my ass.

14:14.478 --> 14:15.813
It's days like these
I wonder

14:15.896 --> 14:18.065
why I ever put on
a shirt and tie.

14:18.148 --> 14:22.236
STREET:
Man, whoever did this one--
a real fan.

14:22.319 --> 14:23.862
They combined
the outfit she wore

14:23.946 --> 14:25.406
on her first tour
with the necklace

14:25.489 --> 14:27.032
from the cover
of the Anasazi album.

14:27.116 --> 14:29.243
You know I'm not gonna
stop asking, right?

14:29.326 --> 14:31.620
About the TLI competition.
What's your problem?

14:32.830 --> 14:34.582
It's the Chris thing.

14:34.665 --> 14:36.792
Dude, are you serious?
She was mad for, like, a minute.

14:36.875 --> 14:38.836
She's onto trying
to whup our asses.

14:38.919 --> 14:40.921
You should try to do the same.

14:38.919 --> 14:40.921
I don't think she's over it.

14:41.005 --> 14:42.047
You heard her.

14:42.131 --> 14:45.259
To her, it's like this
huge betrayal that we signed up.

14:45.342 --> 14:47.136
And now we're all competing
against each other.

14:47.219 --> 14:50.306
I mean, team morale is just more
important to me than winning.

14:50.389 --> 14:51.181
I think you're looking
too much into it.

14:51.265 --> 14:52.975
But, hey, if your
heart's not in it,

14:53.058 --> 14:54.143
you know, pull
your name,

14:54.226 --> 14:55.644
make it easier for
me to get that "W."

14:55.728 --> 14:56.770
Check it out.

15:00.524 --> 15:02.985
I don't think
they're here for selfies.

15:04.445 --> 15:05.779
TAN:
Hey, what up, fellas?

15:05.863 --> 15:06.989
Nice mural.

15:07.072 --> 15:08.490
You guys looking
to touch it up or something?

15:08.574 --> 15:09.491
MAN:
Afternoon, Officers.

15:09.575 --> 15:11.327
I imagine you already
know what we're doing

15:11.410 --> 15:13.287
and why we're doing it.

15:13.370 --> 15:15.497
Someone put a lot of effort
into painting this thing.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.249
If they weren't breaking the
law when they painted it,

15:17.333 --> 15:18.667
we're not breaking the law
painting over it, so...

15:18.751 --> 15:20.878
So, you guys just
hate Rhodium so much

15:20.961 --> 15:22.838
that you spend
your free time going around,

15:22.921 --> 15:24.340
destroying
other people's art?

15:24.423 --> 15:25.841
She was the one spreading hate.

15:25.924 --> 15:27.092
For people like you.

15:27.176 --> 15:29.678
You're holding back the jungle,
Officers, and I salute you.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.388
Any Blue Boys you know
of who might want to do

15:31.472 --> 15:32.890
more than just
paint over murals?

15:32.973 --> 15:34.850
(laughs) We don't really
have members.

15:34.933 --> 15:35.809
We're decentralized.

15:35.893 --> 15:37.936
Really wish I could help.

15:35.893 --> 15:37.936
Yeah, yeah, sure.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.229
STREET:
You parked in the red zone.

15:39.313 --> 15:40.689
I'll just call the tow.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.232
No. (laughs) Hold up, man.

15:42.316 --> 15:44.234
I got to be at work in an hour.

15:42.316 --> 15:44.234
Yeah, hold on.

15:45.653 --> 15:47.488
Hi. Uh, I need
a tow truck right away.

15:47.571 --> 15:48.489
Fine.

15:48.572 --> 15:50.240
There's one guy.

15:50.324 --> 15:51.909
I never met him. We kicked
him out, by the way.

15:51.992 --> 15:53.911
But he was real angry
about tomorrow's memorial.

15:53.994 --> 15:56.330
What's his name?

15:53.994 --> 15:56.330
I only know his
screen name.

15:56.413 --> 15:58.666
Could probably find out more
from the site admin.

15:58.749 --> 16:00.084
Sounds like a plan.

16:01.460 --> 16:05.005
DARRYL:
Santa Monica Community Collee
actually seems pretty cool.

16:05.089 --> 16:06.590
I liked a lot of
the colleges, though.

16:06.674 --> 16:07.800
HONDO:
All right, well, listen, kid.

16:07.883 --> 16:10.052
You know, Santa Monica would be
great for online classes,

16:10.135 --> 16:11.929
but I don't know if you're
gonna like that commute.

16:12.012 --> 16:13.180
You'd have to get up
before I do.

16:13.263 --> 16:14.348
You think I'm-a be
taking morning classes?

16:14.431 --> 16:15.724
Not your little
sleeping ass, no.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.601
(chuckles)

16:15.808 --> 16:17.601
HONDO: What happened
with your pop?

16:17.685 --> 16:19.520
How'd that go?

16:17.685 --> 16:19.520
DARRYL: Uh, it was okay.

16:19.603 --> 16:21.188
He seems good.

16:19.603 --> 16:21.188
HONDO: He didn't
keep you, though?

16:21.271 --> 16:22.940
You made it to the expo
on time, right?

16:23.023 --> 16:25.609
Yeah, yeah. It-It's all good.

16:25.693 --> 16:27.194
Darryl, he is your father.

16:27.277 --> 16:28.612
And you know I respect that.

16:28.696 --> 16:30.197
It's just you've
accomplished so much

16:30.280 --> 16:31.240
over the last couple years.

16:31.323 --> 16:32.908
I just don't want to see
anything get in the way

16:32.991 --> 16:34.034
of continuing that progress.

16:34.118 --> 16:34.952
Look, look, l-like I said...

16:35.035 --> 16:37.121
I know. I know.
It's all good. I got it.

16:37.204 --> 16:38.372
All right, I got to jump.

16:38.455 --> 16:40.249
I got to finish this paper,
all right?

16:38.455 --> 16:40.249
HONDO: All right,

16:40.332 --> 16:41.750
you take care of that homework,
kid. I'll see you tonight.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.210
All right.

16:43.293 --> 16:44.878
Hey. What's up?

16:44.962 --> 16:46.380
Hey. So we looked into
the IP address

16:46.463 --> 16:47.756
that the Blue Boys gave us

16:47.840 --> 16:49.007
for the guy
they kicked out of the group.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.592
Turns out it's
the exact same IP address

16:50.676 --> 16:51.885
that made the threats against

16:51.969 --> 16:53.429
Rhodium's activism summit
in San Diego.

16:53.512 --> 16:54.763
Did you get a name?

16:53.512 --> 16:54.763
Paul Garcia.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.473

His twin sister--

she was a sheriff's deputy

16:57.641 --> 16:58.934
killed in the line of duty
last year.

16:59.017 --> 17:00.644
Makes sense why he would have
an ax to grind

17:00.728 --> 17:02.229
with Rhodium and her fans.

Kid needs help.

that AR-15 out there.

that CI of yours?

19:07.479 --> 19:09.189
Still haven't heard back.

19:14.444 --> 19:16.905
I know how that sounds, but
it's the hottest ticket in town.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.699
Bartering with
funeral tickets?

19:18.782 --> 19:21.535
And if we had a suspect,
I'd tell you hell no.

20:14.588 --> 20:15.672
About an hour.

An hour?

20:17.007 --> 20:18.342
(sighs)

20:18.425 --> 20:20.510
So, on top of lying about
being on time,

20:20.594 --> 20:22.596
he missed half the expo?

20:22.679 --> 20:24.723
Damn it, I thought
he was serious about this.

20:24.806 --> 20:26.767
Been a long time since
he spent time with his father.

20:26.850 --> 20:29.686
I know he's got mixed feelings,
but there's a part of him

20:29.770 --> 20:31.021
that's curious, and he knows

20:31.104 --> 20:32.272
you're trying
to keep them apart.

20:32.356 --> 20:33.523
You know, I
ain't gonna lie.

20:33.607 --> 20:36.193
Half of me wants to tell him

20:36.276 --> 20:37.819
that he can't see Leroy, but...

20:37.903 --> 20:39.696
The other half doesn't want
to keep a teenage boy

20:39.780 --> 20:41.323
from his father.

20:44.076 --> 20:46.203
Darryl has come so far.

20:46.286 --> 20:49.623
I can't just sit back
and let Leroy ruin that.

20:49.706 --> 20:51.708
(chuckles)

20:51.792 --> 20:54.378
You're always the one
that's telling me,

20:54.461 --> 20:56.630
don't look at things
so black and white.

20:58.215 --> 21:02.970
Maybe it's not
"don't let him see Leroy"

21:03.053 --> 21:04.805
or "let him see Leroy."

21:04.888 --> 21:07.349
Maybe there's another way.

21:07.432 --> 21:09.518
Hmm?

21:15.440 --> 21:17.526
All right, great.
Bring him in.

21:17.609 --> 21:19.361
Well, the memorial
tickets did the trick.

21:19.444 --> 21:21.029
Chris's CI came through?

21:21.113 --> 21:22.447
Got the name
"Frank Espinado."

21:22.531 --> 21:25.200
Local gun dealer with access
to grenade launchers.

21:25.283 --> 21:26.868
Apparently he's got
relaxed standards

21:26.952 --> 21:27.911
when it comes to
waiting periods.

21:27.995 --> 21:29.204
Chris is picking
him up now.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.372
All right, that's great.

21:30.455 --> 21:31.873
Jillian Spender
just showed up.

21:31.957 --> 21:34.710
Hicks wants us
to update her on our progress.

21:34.793 --> 21:38.046
So you still don't even
have a suspect?

21:38.130 --> 21:40.215
Or know whether this
person has a backup plan

21:40.298 --> 21:42.551
to hurt my family or
my daughter's fans?

21:40.298 --> 21:42.551
No.

21:42.634 --> 21:44.553
Not yet. But we are
following several leads.

21:44.636 --> 21:45.929
And we are more than capable
of protecting you

21:46.013 --> 21:47.180
and everyone at the memorial.

21:47.264 --> 21:49.057
We have no plans to cancel
or delay it.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.727
Good. I'm not interested
in running from threats.

21:51.810 --> 21:53.395
That's not what Monica
was about.

21:53.478 --> 21:56.231
She faced adversity
her whole life.

21:57.983 --> 22:01.611
Saw things...
she never should've had to see.

22:01.695 --> 22:03.780
HONDO:
Jillian, I know your daughter
didn't talk about it publicly,

22:03.864 --> 22:06.283
but I think I know
what you're referring to.

22:06.366 --> 22:09.786
The boy's family asked her to
keep it as private as she could.

22:09.870 --> 22:11.788
But it's the reason
she felt so strongly

22:11.872 --> 22:13.915
about holding police
accountable.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.793
What exactly happened?

22:16.877 --> 22:18.628
If you don't mind
talking about it.

22:21.048 --> 22:23.550
Monica was 15.

22:23.633 --> 22:26.762
She was just singing
in the church then.

22:26.845 --> 22:29.306
This was before
her first record deal,

22:29.389 --> 22:32.476
so we were still living
in public housing.

22:32.559 --> 22:34.770
She was outside the building
with Walter,

22:34.853 --> 22:37.105
her first boyfriend.

22:37.189 --> 22:39.274
Some police rolled up.

22:39.357 --> 22:40.776
They were looking
for someone

22:40.859 --> 22:43.278
and Walter
"fit the description."

22:43.361 --> 22:45.447
Boys were still
sagging their pants back then,

22:45.530 --> 22:49.117
and Walter reached down
to pull them up.

22:49.201 --> 22:52.079
Just habit.

22:53.371 --> 22:55.290
They said...

22:55.373 --> 22:58.627
they thought
he was going for a gun.

22:58.710 --> 23:01.671
Shot him five times.

23:03.423 --> 23:06.301
He lived. Sort of.

23:06.384 --> 23:09.596
He's been in a vegetative state
ever since.

23:09.679 --> 23:11.640
That's terrible.

23:11.723 --> 23:13.683
I've got kids; I-I can't
imagine something like that

23:13.767 --> 23:15.644
happening to one of them.

23:15.727 --> 23:17.813
I'm sure your kids
aren't the kind these things

23:17.896 --> 23:19.481
tend to happen to.

23:20.774 --> 23:22.776
Police figured they were
guilty of something

23:22.859 --> 23:24.444
soon as they saw them.

23:24.528 --> 23:26.530
Just because of where we lived.

23:28.698 --> 23:30.700
Monica saw how police
treated her different

23:30.784 --> 23:32.160
once she was famous.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.746
Way different.

23:34.830 --> 23:37.958
We were the same exact people.
Just had nicer cars.

23:38.041 --> 23:40.293
I heard Monica
paid to get Walter

23:40.377 --> 23:43.046
the best housing in the city.

23:40.377 --> 23:43.046
And the best doctors.

23:43.130 --> 23:45.215
Soon as she could afford to.

23:47.134 --> 23:49.553
That's the kind of girl she was.

23:49.636 --> 23:51.304
Why people loved her.

23:51.388 --> 23:53.557
And that's why we're not
gonna let anything

23:53.640 --> 23:55.225
ruin her memorial.

23:59.813 --> 24:02.190
As you can see,
I run a legal business

24:02.274 --> 24:03.859
and keep meticulous records.

24:03.942 --> 24:05.861
Yeah, I'm looking at your
meticulous records right now,

24:05.944 --> 24:07.737
Mr. Espinado, and
you've got a record

24:07.821 --> 24:09.406
for the purchase
of that AR-15,

24:09.489 --> 24:11.783
coupled with a mounting
bracket for an M203

24:11.867 --> 24:13.368
grenade launcher,
only the name and the address

24:13.451 --> 24:16.037
listed here, it's,
uh, it's fake.

24:16.121 --> 24:18.540
Makes me wonder about the
other names in that book.

24:18.623 --> 24:20.542
Any of them real?

24:20.625 --> 24:22.043
All I can do is enter
the information I'm given.

24:22.127 --> 24:24.212
CHRIS:
There's a waiting period
for these guns.

24:24.296 --> 24:25.338
You had plenty of time
to check out the information

24:25.422 --> 24:27.591
before the buyer took delivery.

24:25.422 --> 24:27.591
You'll have to give me

24:27.674 --> 24:30.260
a day or two to look into it.

24:27.674 --> 24:30.260
Yeah, well, we don't
have a day or two.

24:30.343 --> 24:32.053
We need a name
or a description of the person

24:32.137 --> 24:33.722
that bought that stuff
and we need it right now.

24:33.805 --> 24:35.891
I can't recall.

24:33.805 --> 24:35.891
You know what I recall,
Mr. Espinado?

24:35.974 --> 24:37.517
When we picked you
up this morning,

24:37.601 --> 24:39.269
you were selling a gun
to someone in your garage.

24:39.352 --> 24:41.229
I'm a gun dealer.
I sell guns for a living.

24:41.313 --> 24:44.024
Pretty sure California law says
gun dealers can only do business

24:44.107 --> 24:46.401
in buildings designated
in their license.

24:46.484 --> 24:49.070
Great.
My house is on my license.

24:49.154 --> 24:50.572
Can I go now?

24:50.655 --> 24:51.531
CHRIS: Your garage isn't
connected to your house.

24:51.615 --> 24:53.867
So technically,
it's a separate building.

24:53.950 --> 24:55.202
For real?

24:53.950 --> 24:55.202
Mm-hmm.

24:55.285 --> 24:56.912
You're gonna charge me
with that?

24:56.995 --> 24:58.538
Why shouldn't we?
Let your expensive lawyer

24:58.622 --> 25:00.624
battle it out with the D.A.

24:58.622 --> 25:00.624
This kind of garbage

25:00.707 --> 25:02.417
is why people
put down fake names.

25:02.500 --> 25:04.252
When it comes to
the Second Amendment,

25:04.336 --> 25:06.379
there's always a loophole
to take your rights away.

25:06.463 --> 25:08.006
Nice try,
but I'm not playing.

25:08.089 --> 25:09.341
All right, the person that
bought that grenade launcher

25:09.424 --> 25:10.342
is looking to
kill people.

25:10.425 --> 25:11.801
And I'm guessing you don't
want to be connected

25:11.885 --> 25:12.802
to something like that.

25:12.886 --> 25:13.887
How do I know you're not lying?

25:13.970 --> 25:15.222
Cops lie all the time.

25:15.305 --> 25:18.225
Look, we're talking
about someone

25:18.308 --> 25:21.478
turning today's memorial
into a bloodbath.

25:21.561 --> 25:24.147
You mean the Rhodium thing?

25:21.561 --> 25:24.147
CHRIS: Yeah.

25:24.231 --> 25:25.857
The Rhodium thing.

25:27.359 --> 25:29.527
Oh, hell no.

25:29.611 --> 25:31.279
My daughter and grandkids
are going to that.

25:31.363 --> 25:32.989
Give me a pen;
I know his real name.

25:33.073 --> 25:35.325
He's bought from me before.

25:35.408 --> 25:36.952
DEACON:
His name is
Mitch Anderson.

25:37.035 --> 25:38.745
Five years ago, his
father, Rick Anderson,

25:38.828 --> 25:40.372
died in a shootout
with sheriff's deputies.

25:40.455 --> 25:41.790
He was under house arrest,

25:41.873 --> 25:43.124
he tampered
with his ankle monitor.

25:43.208 --> 25:45.043
When deputies arrived,
he opened fire.

25:45.126 --> 25:46.127
HONDO:
I remember this.

25:46.211 --> 25:48.338
Mitch Anderson showed up
in the middle of the standoff.

25:48.421 --> 25:50.340

released, he filed

25:55.762 --> 25:57.597
a wrongful death lawsuit
against the county.

25:57.681 --> 25:59.307
A judge dismissed
it pretty fast.

25:59.391 --> 26:00.934
All right, so he's got beef
with L.A. County.

is much worse.

an M203 launcher

36:27.184 --> 36:28.769
See, I-I forget, sometimes,

36:28.853 --> 36:30.771
that not every police officer
that wears that badge

36:30.855 --> 36:32.106
holds himself
to the high standard

36:32.190 --> 36:33.566
that we do here at SWAT.

36:34.525 --> 36:37.069
And I don't think I said this,
and I should've:

36:37.153 --> 36:39.405
I am truly sorry for your loss.

36:47.330 --> 36:49.332
(exhales shakily)

36:56.589 --> 36:58.633
(casings clatter)

37:02.762 --> 37:05.681
Just heard you're going
for master gunner.

37:05.765 --> 37:07.308
Yeah.

37:07.391 --> 37:11.354
I figure, let all the others
walk into their eval with Hicks

37:11.437 --> 37:15.107
bragging about
how many cadres they got.

37:15.191 --> 37:16.692
Anyone can earn a cadre.

37:16.776 --> 37:19.153
One only person in all of SWAT

37:19.236 --> 37:21.072
gets to be master gunner, so...

37:24.533 --> 37:26.077
Hey, uh...

37:30.748 --> 37:32.625
I know we got off
on the wrong foot

37:32.708 --> 37:34.168
with the TLI competition.

37:34.251 --> 37:37.004
And you probably
noticed that

37:37.088 --> 37:38.965
I haven't been
busting my ass for this

37:39.048 --> 37:40.466
the way I normally would.

37:41.884 --> 37:43.010
But that's not me.

37:43.094 --> 37:44.387
And I can't do that anymore.

37:45.429 --> 37:47.181
Good.

37:47.264 --> 37:48.975
No one asked you to.

37:49.058 --> 37:50.351
Not technically, no.

37:50.434 --> 37:52.144
But the way you've been acting
lately says plenty.

37:52.228 --> 37:53.479
I am not

37:53.562 --> 37:55.439
mad at you and Tan
for entering the competition.

37:56.273 --> 37:57.149
I'm not.

37:57.233 --> 37:59.360
Just... treating you guys
like what you are.

37:59.443 --> 38:00.820
For the moment, anyway.

38:05.616 --> 38:08.536
You... you're the ones
that I need to beat.

38:08.619 --> 38:11.706
You're in the way of something
I really want.

38:11.789 --> 38:13.874
Some people can
compete one minute

38:13.958 --> 38:17.378
and be palling around
the next, and...

38:17.461 --> 38:19.338
And that's not you.

38:20.798 --> 38:22.008
I get it.

38:23.634 --> 38:25.720
Once the competition's over,
though...

38:25.803 --> 38:28.014
After I smoke your ass? Yeah.

38:28.097 --> 38:30.558
Maybe things will
go back to normal.

38:30.641 --> 38:32.018
Maybe.

38:34.645 --> 38:37.898
Stevens has had master gunner

38:37.982 --> 38:39.900
locked up for
the last three years.

38:39.984 --> 38:41.402
If you can't dethrone him,

38:41.485 --> 38:43.404
you're back to square one.

38:43.487 --> 38:45.489
Well, go big or go home, right?

38:47.491 --> 38:48.951
Looks like you're
going home.

38:49.035 --> 38:51.078
I've been the only one here

38:51.162 --> 38:52.580
for, like, an hour.

38:51.162 --> 38:52.580
Wow.

38:52.663 --> 38:54.665
A whole hour?

39:01.005 --> 39:03.049
(sighs)

39:19.148 --> 39:21.108
I'm so sorry
for being late.

39:21.192 --> 39:22.568
Hey, it's all good.

39:22.651 --> 39:24.445
I just got home
myself, actually.

39:24.528 --> 39:25.946
Have you eaten yet?

39:26.030 --> 39:27.239
Just picked
up some grub.

39:27.323 --> 39:28.783
Uh, I can eat.

39:28.866 --> 39:30.409
What about you, Leroy?

39:30.493 --> 39:32.286
You want to sit
down for a bite?

39:32.369 --> 39:34.246
Oh, no, I'm good, man.
Uh...

39:34.330 --> 39:36.123
Halfway house
got a curfew anyway.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.458
Oh. All right.

39:37.541 --> 39:39.585
Hey, but listen,
um, this Saturday

39:39.668 --> 39:41.879
there's a car show.
It's up in Malibu.

39:41.962 --> 39:43.422
But, you know,
Pops can't be around

39:43.506 --> 39:44.965
a lot of people till
his chemo's done, so...

39:45.049 --> 39:46.967
Darryl's gonna be
showing off his ride.

39:47.051 --> 39:48.469
You should come.

39:48.552 --> 39:49.929
I mean, you wouldn't mind that,
would you?

39:50.012 --> 39:50.930
Uh, n-no.

39:51.013 --> 39:52.473
You want to?

39:55.434 --> 39:57.686
Yeah, I-I'll see what I can do.

39:55.434 --> 39:57.686
All right, cool.

39:57.770 --> 39:59.688
I'm-a just text you
after school tomorrow.

39:59.772 --> 40:00.773
A'ight.

40:00.856 --> 40:01.857
All right.

40:04.860 --> 40:06.195
(door opens)

40:06.278 --> 40:08.322
(door closes)

40:09.573 --> 40:11.992
I see you, Hondo.

40:12.076 --> 40:13.536
I see you.

40:14.954 --> 40:16.497
Listen, I'm just trying

40:16.580 --> 40:19.834
to bring Darryl's two worlds
together, man.

40:19.917 --> 40:22.419
I raised him for two years,

40:22.503 --> 40:23.796
but you're his father.

40:23.879 --> 40:25.673
So why make him
split his time?

40:25.756 --> 40:28.008
Put that kind of
pressure on him?

40:28.092 --> 40:29.426
We're in this together, man.

40:29.510 --> 40:32.179
Oh. Oh, we're in this together.

40:32.263 --> 40:35.015
Even after you left me hanging
with the parole board?

40:35.099 --> 40:37.518
Leroy, come on...

40:35.099 --> 40:37.518
No, no. You--
you talked plenty.

40:37.601 --> 40:39.562
My turn.

40:39.645 --> 40:41.856
Now, you done him some good,
I admit that.

40:41.939 --> 40:44.525
I mean, he's more of a reader
than he was a few years ago.

40:44.608 --> 40:47.027
But there's
a lot more than books

40:47.111 --> 40:48.362
that makes you a man.

40:48.445 --> 40:50.030
(sighs)

40:50.114 --> 40:53.075
Don't know if he can cut it
out there yet.

40:54.618 --> 40:58.205
By "out there," I really hope
you're talking about college

40:58.289 --> 40:59.999
and not the streets.

41:03.127 --> 41:07.381
Well, like you said, Hondo...

41:07.464 --> 41:09.633
I'm his father.

41:25.649 --> 41:27.693
