17:21.958 --> 17:23.619
(COUGHING)

17:29.591 --> 17:32.253
You gotta see somebody
about that cough, Daddy.

17:35.305 --> 17:40.425
I'm glad I got you to nag me to death
now that your mama's gone.

17:44.356 --> 17:46.438
They can't come back
to class after Thanksgiving?

17:46.608 --> 17:47.688
No.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.641
That means they miss
the whole first semester.

17:50.153 --> 17:51.734
Means they won't be ready
to march Mardi Gras.

17:51.821 --> 17:52.981
-Correct.
-(SIGHS)

17:53.240 --> 17:54.821
This is not their first fight.

17:54.908 --> 17:55.897
It's the first one I've seen.

17:55.992 --> 17:57.528
This is the third since September.

17:57.994 --> 18:01.657
I had to beg the principal
this time not to expel them both flat out.

18:01.873 --> 18:02.988
Damn.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.793
What is this about?

18:06.002 --> 18:08.254
Charles's older brother witnessed a shooting.

18:08.505 --> 18:10.871
It's gotten around maybe
he talked to the police.

18:11.299 --> 18:14.257
-Devon called Charles's brother a snitch.
-Exactly.

18:17.472 --> 18:20.214
Man, I didn't know. I had no idea.

18:20.517 --> 18:23.509
This room is a safe haven, as it should be.

18:24.104 --> 18:28.473
But sometimes we lose track of what goes on
outside this room with these kids.

18:34.281 --> 18:37.614
The storm brought out the best in people
and the worst.

18:38.368 --> 18:40.859
I saw shit I hope I never see again.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.699
A lot of those stories
turned out to be untrue, though.

18:43.873 --> 18:47.331
All that stuff about
the Convention Center and Superdome...

18:47.544 --> 18:51.128
Yeah, well, now they're saying
nobody got raped or jacked

18:51.214 --> 18:52.795
or killed or nothing during the storm.

18:52.882 --> 18:54.918
You know that ain't true neither.

18:55.385 --> 18:58.172
What about the Westbank?
TV cameras didn't make it over here.

18:59.097 --> 19:01.133
Just about everybody over here got hit,

19:01.308 --> 19:05.551
Oakwood Mall, Sears and them,
all up and down here.

19:05.895 --> 19:07.431
General Meyer, General de Gaulle.

19:07.731 --> 19:08.720
How'd you do?

19:09.024 --> 19:11.766
Man, cleaned me out.

19:13.737 --> 19:14.726
Hmm.

19:16.239 --> 19:17.604
Did you hear any stories about the Point?

19:17.907 --> 19:20.159
Yeah. I heard they was
forming up posses over there,

19:20.243 --> 19:21.779
talking about shooting anybody

19:21.870 --> 19:24.452
come in the neighborhood
they don't know, especially us.

19:24.748 --> 19:27.581
-Did they? Shoot anybody.
-I heard they did.

19:27.917 --> 19:29.828
Some brother who live over there.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.752
Guess they didn't recognize him in the dark.

19:33.173 --> 19:34.913
-You believe it?
-The Point's white.

19:35.133 --> 19:37.590
-Neighborhood alls around it is black.
-Right.

19:37.761 --> 19:40.798
Rumors fly, people scared,
everybody got a gun.

19:41.181 --> 19:42.296
But you don't know for sure?

19:42.599 --> 19:45.682
I know, but I don't know.
You know what I'm saying?

19:48.271 --> 19:49.260
(SIGHS)

19:49.439 --> 19:51.430
-All right, well, thank you for your time, sir.
-Yeah.

19:54.652 --> 19:56.108
Look here,

19:56.196 --> 19:59.780
I did hear about something happen
at a strip mall over here off General de Gaulle.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.441
A store owner shot a looter,
something like that.

20:05.246 --> 20:07.953
(ON PHONE) Homicide. Fletcher speaking.
How can I help you?

20:08.416 --> 20:10.498
ANTHONY: (ON PHONE) Got a meeting
with the DA on Thursday.

20:11.044 --> 20:14.332
Yeah. Evidence analysis on Wednesday, 3:00.

20:14.547 --> 20:17.084
Yeah, as far as I know,
Chief Riley's gonna be there.

20:17.759 --> 20:18.794
Yeah.

20:21.554 --> 20:22.543
What?

20:23.306 --> 20:26.013
Apparently, Calderon and them
overlooked some evidence.

20:26.393 --> 20:28.634
The family found the smoke alarm
stashed behind the couch.

20:28.978 --> 20:31.264
-Fuck. They touch it?
-Nope.

20:31.481 --> 20:32.971
Left it right where they found it.

20:33.149 --> 20:36.141
Says there's blood on it
and maybe what looks like a thumbprint.

20:36.820 --> 20:38.902
I can run by there
and pick it up later this evening.

20:39.197 --> 20:40.437
Well, what the fuck is Calderon doing?

20:40.532 --> 20:42.818
He can't get to it till tomorrow.
He's got a detail.

20:44.494 --> 20:45.984
Yeah, I know.

20:46.371 --> 20:50.080
All right, well, maybe there's a usable print.

20:50.458 --> 20:51.573
Maybe there's DNA.

20:51.709 --> 20:54.041
Maybe we can convince the new DA
not to toss the case

20:54.129 --> 20:56.871
just because we fucked the evidence
collection and the chain of custody.

20:57.048 --> 20:58.549
At least we got a fighting chance.

20:58.758 --> 21:01.670
Eddie Jordan would've kicked this sucker
soon as he heard about the smoke alarm.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.168
Fucking Eddie.

21:03.263 --> 21:05.470
Maybe now we'll actually convict us
some motherfuckers.

21:06.141 --> 21:07.551
Probably not this motherfucker,

21:08.184 --> 21:09.219
but see what you can do.

21:11.020 --> 21:15.980
But then, then I run into Toby and Simply
on Frenchmen Street,

21:16.526 --> 21:19.393
so we have to go see Morning 40 at d.b.a.

21:19.487 --> 21:21.398
-Davis.
-And, you know, it's de rigueur.

21:21.656 --> 21:24.989
-It's a Halloween tradition.
-Davis, it's okay, really.

21:25.076 --> 21:26.486
-All right.
-(CHUCKLES)

21:26.911 --> 21:28.572
Well, how'd it go?

21:29.372 --> 21:31.454
Quintron and Miss Pussycat were awesome.

21:31.541 --> 21:32.747
Always.

21:34.669 --> 21:37.706
Marvin Frey was there, the manager.

21:38.715 --> 21:40.876
Shawn Colvin's friend from Austin.

21:41.926 --> 21:43.882
It was the demo. He heard the demo.

21:43.970 --> 21:46.677
He heard the demo
and drove down from Austin just to see you!

21:46.890 --> 21:49.632
I told you that that was a stroke of genius.

21:49.893 --> 21:53.431
Actually, he was already in town
to see Quintron and Miss Pussycat.

21:53.730 --> 21:55.595
But, yeah, he liked the demo.

21:56.065 --> 21:57.054
He liked it?

21:57.317 --> 21:59.649
Or did he "like" it?

22:01.571 --> 22:03.107
He wants to represent us.

22:04.115 --> 22:05.446
-That's great!
-(LAUGHING)

22:05.783 --> 22:07.114
That's great.

22:08.119 --> 22:09.780
But, you know, the history
of New Orleans music

22:09.871 --> 22:13.989
is replete with tales
of egregious managerial malfeasance.

22:15.210 --> 22:16.996
I know. I've heard all the stories.

22:18.087 --> 22:19.247
I haven't signed a contract yet.

22:19.464 --> 22:21.796
All right, don't, not until I read it first.

22:23.218 --> 22:24.754
Did he hit on you?

22:25.720 --> 22:26.755
Kind of, not really.

22:27.013 --> 22:28.753
Great! What does that mean?

22:29.224 --> 22:31.681
It's hard to explain. You'd have to be a girl.

22:32.310 --> 22:33.925
I mean, it's not overt, you know.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.305
It's just always there.

22:35.522 --> 22:36.637
The way he looks at you.

22:37.774 --> 22:38.809
I can handle it.

22:39.609 --> 22:41.770
He'sjust kind of, like, oozy.

22:43.613 --> 22:45.319
Oozy might be good in a manager.

22:45.490 --> 22:46.900
(CHUCKLES) You think?

22:47.784 --> 22:49.115
(JAZZ PLAYING)

23:01.381 --> 23:02.746
Come in, Jennifer. Come in.

23:04.592 --> 23:06.583
I was passing. I heard the music.

23:09.264 --> 23:10.504
Come on in.

23:12.934 --> 23:14.515
Come in.

23:18.106 --> 23:19.312
That's Papa Celestin.

23:19.607 --> 23:22.349
-You like it?
-Yeah. He from here?

23:23.152 --> 23:25.529
Oh, yeah. Where else?

23:26.489 --> 23:27.990
One of my favorites.

23:28.992 --> 23:30.152
Listen.

23:34.998 --> 23:38.490
I love it when the band
comes in on the vocals.

23:39.711 --> 23:42.999
They used to do that
a lot in the old days, Papa, Fats Waller.

23:43.214 --> 23:45.671
Yeah, always cracks me up.

23:46.217 --> 23:47.627
Call and response?

23:48.845 --> 23:50.506
Yeah, that's right.

23:50.847 --> 23:54.260
The lead sings, "Oh, Marie LaVeau,"

23:54.350 --> 23:56.762
then the guys in the band go, "Marie LaVeau."

23:57.020 --> 23:59.727
"Yes, Marie LaVeau." You sing.

24:00.106 --> 24:02.347
(SINGING) Hey, Marie LaVeau.

24:02.692 --> 24:05.183
(SINGING) Folks still believe

24:05.653 --> 24:12.274
In the Voodoo Queen

24:13.494 --> 24:18.284
Way down

24:20.168 --> 24:22.284
yonder

24:22.378 --> 24:28.965
In New Orleans

24:34.515 --> 24:36.051
-PAPA: That's it.
-(CHUCKLES)

24:39.062 --> 24:40.893
Blight is NOAH's number one concern.

24:41.439 --> 24:43.145
It affects quality of life,

24:43.232 --> 24:45.974
property values, neighborhood stabilization.

24:46.235 --> 24:48.772
The fact is that we don't have enough people

24:48.988 --> 24:51.070
-for the buildings that we have.
-WOMAN: Please.

24:51.908 --> 24:54.741
Every neighborhood in this city
has lost population since the storm,

24:54.827 --> 24:56.863
especially African-Americans,

24:56.954 --> 24:59.331
the elderly, and families with children.

24:59.499 --> 25:01.581
-We have too much housing stock.
-MAN: Really?

25:01.876 --> 25:04.333
That's good news,
because we got hundreds of people

25:04.420 --> 25:05.921
living underneath the expressway

25:06.005 --> 25:08.542
and camped out on Duncan Plaza
right across from city hall.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.290
The mayor can see it from his office.

25:10.385 --> 25:12.842
WOMAN 2: And the city and the corps
of engineers shouldn't be knocking

25:12.929 --> 25:15.966
down houses of people who
want to come back

25:16.182 --> 25:17.922
and haven't had a chance to fix them.

25:18.017 --> 25:20.303
-Ma'am...
-Or giving NOAH remediation contracts

25:20.395 --> 25:22.056
to contractors who aren't doing the work.

25:22.313 --> 25:24.349
Half a dozen empty houses
in my neighborhood,

25:24.440 --> 25:27.523
NOAH signs on them
and no work's been done, none.

25:27.610 --> 25:29.066
What the city is trying to do

25:29.153 --> 25:32.111
is put together a database
of all the unoccupied houses

25:32.198 --> 25:34.314
and then identify the ones that are blighted...

25:47.630 --> 25:51.122
WAITRESS: Just wanna let you folks know
we have our special Southern dinner tonight.

25:52.468 --> 25:54.254
Here you are. Enjoy.

25:56.764 --> 25:59.301
If I didn't know any better,
I'd think you were stalking me.

25:59.809 --> 26:01.765
-Janette Desautel.
-I know.

26:04.147 --> 26:05.262
Tim Feeny.

26:06.149 --> 26:07.855
Feeny, that's that steakhouse
in Metairie, right?

26:08.151 --> 26:11.188
My New Orleans flagship
is on Poydras in the CBD, Tim's.

26:11.446 --> 26:13.357
-Tim's, I know where that is.
-Ever eat there?

26:13.865 --> 26:16.151
I'm sorry, I don't think I've eaten
in any of your restaurants.

26:16.909 --> 26:18.649
Well, I'd be shocked if you had.

26:19.036 --> 26:20.901
I used to go to your place
on Laurel Street all the time.

26:21.247 --> 26:22.908
-Oh, really?
-You were always great.

26:22.999 --> 26:25.661
But now, a whole nother level.

26:26.335 --> 26:27.745
Oh, come on.

26:27.962 --> 26:29.702
I own a lot of restaurants, Chef,

26:30.423 --> 26:33.381
restaurants you'd never go to
and wouldn't like if you did.

26:33.676 --> 26:35.007
But they're successful.

26:35.845 --> 26:37.335
I'm sure they are.

26:37.597 --> 26:39.679
I'm looking to do something different.

26:40.349 --> 26:43.716
I want to open a great restaurant
with a great chef.

26:44.687 --> 26:46.803
And to be perfectly honest,

26:47.273 --> 26:49.355
I'd like that chef to be you.

26:49.609 --> 26:51.816
I'll tell you the same thing I told the last guy,

26:52.528 --> 26:54.689
I appreciate the interest, Mr. Feeny, I do,

26:55.740 --> 26:57.025
but I'm happy here.

26:57.283 --> 26:58.568
Would you just give it some thought?

26:58.743 --> 27:00.233
I want to do something great

27:01.162 --> 27:02.527
in New Orleans.

27:03.247 --> 27:04.828
Remember New Orleans?

27:04.916 --> 27:05.996
Every day.

27:06.542 --> 27:07.793
Think about it.

27:08.961 --> 27:11.338
I'll think about thinking about it.

27:14.008 --> 27:15.714
You know, I met this one contractor,

27:16.010 --> 27:18.376
a lady from Florida, Loretta Mortenson.

27:18.679 --> 27:20.215
Racked up a ton of NOAH jobs.

27:20.890 --> 27:21.879
How'd she get them?

27:22.141 --> 27:23.722
Maybe she's a friend of Stacey's.

27:24.227 --> 27:26.343
Stacey Jackson? Runs NOAH?

27:27.939 --> 27:30.146
-You know how many she's got?
-|mpossible to tell.

27:30.316 --> 27:32.557
There's no paper
on who's got what properties.

27:33.903 --> 27:35.484
No written contracts? No permits?

27:35.696 --> 27:37.561
Nope. Handshake and a smile.

27:38.157 --> 27:39.658
This town, you can't make it up.

27:39.867 --> 27:41.732
The NOAH program, it's federal money,

27:42.286 --> 27:45.073
but the people getting that money have
to be connected locally.

27:46.582 --> 27:47.992
Yeah, right.

27:56.509 --> 27:57.624
(SINGING) Every single minute

27:58.052 --> 27:59.553
Of every single day

27:59.887 --> 28:03.050
You wonder are you doing right
You wonder should you stay

28:03.766 --> 28:06.803
'Cause everything is broken
All the lines are down

28:06.978 --> 28:08.684
Confusion rides down every street

28:08.771 --> 28:10.432
There's rumors all around

28:10.648 --> 28:12.388
The media is black and white

28:13.401 --> 28:16.768
Politicians whine

28:18.072 --> 28:19.937
Everything is broken

28:20.283 --> 28:24.276
Except the long black line

28:29.000 --> 28:30.206
Everywhere you look

28:30.626 --> 28:31.911
Everywhere you go

28:32.295 --> 28:35.708
You read it like a book
It's the only way to know

28:35.882 --> 28:37.964
How high the water got

28:38.634 --> 28:41.797
August 29

28:43.139 --> 28:45.221
That hurricane last summer

28:45.725 --> 28:49.309
Left a long black line

28:50.730 --> 28:54.473
The long black line

28:57.278 --> 29:02.523
The long black line

29:04.994 --> 29:07.201
Hey, man, thanks. Thank you.

29:08.706 --> 29:09.821
Hey.

29:10.833 --> 29:12.869
-Hey.
-Hey, Sonny, man.

29:14.003 --> 29:15.834
-You got a haircut.
-Yeah.

29:16.005 --> 29:18.997
-Working on a shrimp boat out of Chalmette.
-No shit.

29:19.091 --> 29:20.797
-Yeah.
-(LAUGHING)

29:21.636 --> 29:23.501
Heard about The Disciples.

29:25.181 --> 29:26.421
The Apostles.

29:26.682 --> 29:28.638
Yeah. What you gonna do?

29:29.143 --> 29:31.179
You still on the street? You busking?

29:31.938 --> 29:34.099
-l'm now appearing in my living room.
-Huh.

29:34.941 --> 29:36.647
The Lightnin' is looking for somebody.

29:37.193 --> 29:38.979
-Rhythm?
-No, keyboards.

29:46.035 --> 29:49.823
Say, tomorrow night,
I was thinking of maybe going to the Hall.

29:50.373 --> 29:51.453
You trying to get on at the Hall?

29:51.832 --> 29:53.083
I Wish.

29:53.876 --> 29:55.707
It's a closed shop there.

29:57.713 --> 30:01.046
A couple of my students,
they're showing interest in trad jazz.

30:01.133 --> 30:02.248
I was thinking about taking them.

30:02.677 --> 30:04.292
That's so nice of you, Antoine.

30:04.804 --> 30:06.340
You are a good teacher.

30:07.223 --> 30:09.555
-I knew you would be.
-Yeah, you wanna come with?

30:09.725 --> 30:10.805
-The Hall?
-Uh-huh.

30:10.893 --> 30:14.727
Hell no, but you go, have fun.

30:17.233 --> 30:18.689
The thing is

30:19.735 --> 30:20.850
they're girls.

30:21.779 --> 30:24.316
I think they'd feel more comfortable
if you were there, too.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.485
-The Hall?
-You ain't never been there.

30:27.743 --> 30:30.359
-It ain't what you think.
-Sound like a snooze to me.

30:30.579 --> 30:32.080

30:51.267 --> 30:53.679
When Mortenson took you around,
she showed you a few places,

30:53.978 --> 30:56.185
told you to pick one and put lipstick on it?

30:56.981 --> 30:59.188
-Yeah.
-I need the addresses.

31:01.610 --> 31:03.271
Come on to my truck.

31:05.406 --> 31:07.943
CORNELL: High cotton, brah. High cotton.

31:08.034 --> 31:09.774
Yeah, man. True that.

31:09.869 --> 31:11.700
Sorry, sir, I don't see your name.

31:13.664 --> 31:15.780
-Antoine Batiste?
-Nope.

31:15.916 --> 31:17.122
Oh, damn.

31:18.669 --> 31:19.909

-LaDonna, my name ain't on the list.

You're shitting me.

31:30.264 --> 31:32.596
-Oh, no, I shit you not.
-All right.

31:32.683 --> 31:34.674

-Victorine, it's LaDonna.

31:46.697 --> 31:51.157
I'm so sorry to bother you.
You must be so, so busy.

31:51.243 --> 31:52.619
No, no, not at all.

31:52.703 --> 31:56.116
There seems to be some confusion
at the gatehouse.

31:56.999 --> 32:01.208
Did you happen to remember
to leave the boys' father's name,

32:01.587 --> 32:05.546
-Antoine Batiste?
-Of course I did. I am so sorry.

32:05.633 --> 32:07.999
-I will call them right now.
-Thank you.

32:12.473 --> 32:16.887
Wow, must be nice, live on a golf course.

-Do it look like I play?
-No. I play.

32:23.317 --> 32:25.182
I'd love to play that bitch.

32:27.321 --> 32:28.401
That one, too.

32:28.489 --> 32:30.730
-Hello. Antoine?
-No, ma'am.

32:30.866 --> 32:33.403
Cornell, Cornell Williams. I'm just his ride.

32:33.494 --> 32:35.155
I'm so sorry. Victorine.

32:35.538 --> 32:36.823
Antoine.

32:37.373 --> 32:38.704
So nice to finally meet you. Come on in.

32:38.791 --> 32:40.531
-Thank you much.
-Thank you.

32:41.794 --> 32:43.034
Thanks.

32:44.380 --> 32:47.292
You know, actually,
we have met a number of times.

32:48.425 --> 32:50.757
We have? I'm sorry. I don't recall.

You belong to those organizations?

32:56.267 --> 32:57.382
(SCOFFS) No.

32:57.518 --> 32:59.509
(LAUGHING) No, no. I'm a musician.

33:00.062 --> 33:02.053
I play the Carnival balls on occasion.

33:02.356 --> 33:04.312
Well, one meets so many people at Carnival.

33:05.276 --> 33:06.812
The boys are upstairs in their room, studying.

33:07.069 --> 33:09.105
Would you like a glass of lemonade,
Mr. Williams?

33:09.238 --> 33:10.774
Don't mind if I do.

33:11.574 --> 33:13.815
-You're not related to my husband, are you?
-The judge?

33:13.909 --> 33:15.365
-VICTORINE: Yes.
-I don't believe so.

33:15.452 --> 33:17.238
It's a common name,
Williams and all, you know?

I'm glad to see you, too.
Man, it's been a long time.

33:34.597 --> 33:36.553
Let me look at you. You're still growing.

33:37.641 --> 33:38.721
How you doing, little man? How's school?

33:38.809 --> 33:40.595
-It's good.
-All right.

33:40.978 --> 33:45.597
Hey, listen, lwanted to follow up
on what we talked about last Carnival.

33:48.194 --> 33:49.775
You know, when we were
watching the marching bands?

33:52.948 --> 33:54.688
Lessons, music lessons.

33:54.783 --> 33:55.989
Learning an instrument.

33:56.243 --> 33:57.904
I wanna get that started
now that y'all are back.

33:58.120 --> 33:59.155
Are you gonna teach us?

33:59.288 --> 34:00.277
(CHUCKLES)

34:00.956 --> 34:02.457
That depends.

34:04.376 --> 34:07.459
You thinking of playing trombone?

34:08.964 --> 34:10.500
Not really.

34:11.383 --> 34:13.715
Yeah, it's probably better
you get somebody else

34:15.095 --> 34:16.221
What about you, little man?

34:16.513 --> 34:17.923
Drums? You always bangin' on shit.

34:18.015 --> 34:19.425
Shit, I don't know.

Y'all do want lessons, right?

34:23.312 --> 34:25.143
-I wanna take tennis lessons.
-Tennis?

34:25.564 --> 34:27.225
Yeah. Mom said I should ask you
if you'd pay for those.

34:27.650 --> 34:30.733
Sure, okay. But no instruments, huh?

34:31.737 --> 34:33.273
I mean, now that y'all are at St. Aug,

34:33.364 --> 34:34.945
it's a golden opportunity.

What you've got, Albert,
is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Years of plaster dust and whatever else
we've been breathing since the storm.

It never bothered me before.

I'm going to give you some breathing
exercises and prescribe an inhaler.

35:37.720 --> 35:38.800
This gonna fix it?

but you can prevent it from getting worse.

of the blood work gets back.

36:33.108 --> 36:36.191
Much loved by critics, by customers.
And you know why?

36:36.653 --> 36:39.110
Because from day one,
these guys did whatever the fuck they wanted.

36:39.323 --> 36:41.530
They didn't give a shit
what the market told them to cook.

36:41.784 --> 36:43.900
They figured out who they were,
what they were good at,

36:43.994 --> 36:45.825
what they wanted to do, and they did that.

36:46.080 --> 36:48.446

go through it all again,

being the boss.

This time you'll have a partner.

You won't have to deal with the bullshit,
permits, insurance, inspectors.

The bullshit, that's myjob.

-What am I supposed to tell the boys?
-Nothing.

37:23.575 --> 37:25.566
-Excuse me?
-l'm their mother. I'll tell them.

37:25.661 --> 37:27.652
-What are you gonna tell them?
-The truth,

37:28.831 --> 37:33.825
that I cannot stay under the same roof
as your brother and his wife,

37:34.002 --> 37:35.333
not one more night.

37:44.680 --> 37:45.760
LaDonna, you just...

37:45.848 --> 37:49.557
And you can tell them that I will pick them up
every morning and take them to school.

37:49.726 --> 37:51.307
You're gonna run back and forth like that?

37:51.520 --> 37:54.978
It's just temporary until we get our own place.

37:59.528 --> 38:01.359
And I'm gonna tell them that, too.

43:11.298 --> 43:13.004

43:14.176 --> 43:15.916
I was curious to see how they were coming,

43:16.553 --> 43:17.838
so I checked them out.

43:18.221 --> 43:19.552
First one's a vacant lot.

43:19.848 --> 43:21.258
Second one's been completely rehabbed

so I stopped to help.

46:35.877 --> 46:36.866
Hmm.

46:38.380 --> 46:39.870
They tell you what happened to him?

46:40.090 --> 46:42.206
They said his brother and a friend
had went up to the strip mall

46:42.592 --> 46:43.752
looking for necessities.

46:43.843 --> 46:45.583
Somebody shot him in the chest.

46:48.556 --> 46:50.342
The guy who got shot,
did they tell you his name?

46:50.600 --> 46:52.682
King. Brother said his name was King.

46:54.562 --> 46:57.144
So we get him in the back seat
and take off, me and his brother.

46:57.232 --> 46:59.518
He's bleeding bad and I don't think
he's gonna make it to West Jeff,

46:59.651 --> 47:00.640
so I drive to the school...

47:00.735 --> 47:02.020
-The hospital?
-Right.

So I drive to the school
about half a mile from here.
