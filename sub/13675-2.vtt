(COUGHING)

17:21.958 --> 17:23.619
(COUGHING)

17:29.591 --> 17:32.253
You gotta see somebody
about that cough, Daddy.

17:35.305 --> 17:40.425
I'm glad I got you to nag me to death
now that your mama's gone.

17:44.356 --> 17:46.438
They can't come back
to class after Thanksgiving?

17:46.608 --> 17:47.688
No.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.641
That means they miss
the whole first semester.

17:50.153 --> 17:51.734
Means they won't be ready
to march Mardi Gras.

17:51.821 --> 17:52.981
-Correct.
-(SIGHS)

17:53.240 --> 17:54.821
This is not their first fight.

17:54.908 --> 17:55.897
It's the first one I've seen.

17:55.992 --> 17:57.528
This is the third since September.

17:57.994 --> 18:01.657
I had to beg the principal
this time not to expel them both flat out.

18:01.873 --> 18:02.988
Damn.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.793
What is this about?

18:06.002 --> 18:08.254
Charles's older brother witnessed a shooting.

18:08.505 --> 18:10.871
It's gotten around maybe
he talked to the police.

18:11.299 --> 18:14.257
-Devon called Charles's brother a snitch.
-Exactly.

18:17.472 --> 18:20.214
Man, I didn't know. I had no idea.

18:20.517 --> 18:23.509
This room is a safe haven, as it should be.

18:24.104 --> 18:28.473
But sometimes we lose track of what goes on
outside this room with these kids.

18:34.281 --> 18:37.614
The storm brought out the best in people
and the worst.

18:38.368 --> 18:40.859
I saw shit I hope I never see again.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.699
A lot of those stories
turned out to be untrue, though.

18:43.873 --> 18:47.331
All that stuff about
the Convention Center and Superdome...

18:47.544 --> 18:51.128
Yeah, well, now they're saying
nobody got raped or jacked

18:51.214 --> 18:52.795
or killed or nothing during the storm.

18:52.882 --> 18:54.918
You know that ain't true neither.

18:55.385 --> 18:58.172
What about the Westbank?
TV cameras didn't make it over here.

18:59.097 --> 19:01.133
Just about everybody over here got hit,

19:01.308 --> 19:05.551
Oakwood Mall, Sears and them,
all up and down here.

19:05.895 --> 19:07.431
General Meyer, General de Gaulle.

19:07.731 --> 19:08.720
How'd you do?

19:09.024 --> 19:11.766
Man, cleaned me out.

19:13.737 --> 19:14.726
Hmm.

19:16.239 --> 19:17.604
Did you hear any stories about the Point?

19:17.907 --> 19:20.159
Yeah. I heard they was
forming up posses over there,

19:20.243 --> 19:21.779
talking about shooting anybody

19:21.870 --> 19:24.452
come in the neighborhood
they don't know, especially us.

19:24.748 --> 19:27.581
-Did they? Shoot anybody.
-I heard they did.

19:27.917 --> 19:29.828
Some brother who live over there.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.752
Guess they didn't recognize him in the dark.

19:33.173 --> 19:34.913
-You believe it?
-The Point's white.

19:35.133 --> 19:37.590
-Neighborhood alls around it is black.
-Right.

19:37.761 --> 19:40.798
Rumors fly, people scared,
everybody got a gun.

19:41.181 --> 19:42.296
But you don't know for sure?

19:42.599 --> 19:45.682
I know, but I don't know.
You know what I'm saying?

19:48.271 --> 19:49.260
(SIGHS)

19:49.439 --> 19:51.430
-All right, well, thank you for your time, sir.
-Yeah.

19:54.652 --> 19:56.108
Look here,

19:56.196 --> 19:59.780
I did hear about something happen
at a strip mall over here off General de Gaulle.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.441
A store owner shot a looter,
something like that.

20:05.246 --> 20:07.953
(ON PHONE) Homicide. Fletcher speaking.
How can I help you?

20:08.416 --> 20:10.498
ANTHONY: (ON PHONE) Got a meeting
with the DA on Thursday.

20:11.044 --> 20:14.332
Yeah. Evidence analysis on Wednesday, 3:00.

20:14.547 --> 20:17.084
Yeah, as far as I know,
Chief Riley's gonna be there.

20:17.759 --> 20:18.794
Yeah.

20:21.554 --> 20:22.543
What?

20:23.306 --> 20:26.013
Apparently, Calderon and them
overlooked some evidence.

20:26.393 --> 20:28.634
The family found the smoke alarm
stashed behind the couch.

20:28.978 --> 20:31.264
-Fuck. They touch it?
-Nope.

20:31.481 --> 20:32.971
Left it right where they found it.

20:33.149 --> 20:36.141
Says there's blood on it
and maybe what looks like a thumbprint.

20:36.820 --> 20:38.902
I can run by there
and pick it up later this evening.

20:39.197 --> 20:40.437
Well, what the fuck is Calderon doing?

20:40.532 --> 20:42.818
He can't get to it till tomorrow.
He's got a detail.

20:44.494 --> 20:45.984
Yeah, I know.

20:46.371 --> 20:50.080
All right, well, maybe there's a usable print.

20:50.458 --> 20:51.573
Maybe there's DNA.

20:51.709 --> 20:54.041
Maybe we can convince the new DA
not to toss the case

20:54.129 --> 20:56.871
just because we fucked the evidence
collection and the chain of custody.

20:57.048 --> 20:58.549
At least we got a fighting chance.

20:58.758 --> 21:01.670
Eddie Jordan would've kicked this sucker
soon as he heard about the smoke alarm.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.168
Fucking Eddie.

21:03.263 --> 21:05.470
Maybe now we'll actually convict us
some motherfuckers.

21:06.141 --> 21:07.551
Probably not this motherfucker,

21:08.184 --> 21:09.219
but see what you can do.

21:11.020 --> 21:15.980
But then, then I run into Toby and Simply
on Frenchmen Street,

21:16.526 --> 21:19.393
so we have to go see Morning 40 at d.b.a.

21:19.487 --> 21:21.398
-Davis.
-And, you know, it's de rigueur.

21:21.656 --> 21:24.989
-It's a Halloween tradition.
-Davis, it's okay, really.

21:25.076 --> 21:26.486
-All right.
-(CHUCKLES)

21:26.911 --> 21:28.572
Well, how'd it go?

21:29.372 --> 21:31.454
Quintron and Miss Pussycat were awesome.

21:31.541 --> 21:32.747
Always.

21:34.669 --> 21:37.706
Marvin Frey was there, the manager.

21:38.715 --> 21:40.876
Shawn Colvin's friend from Austin.

21:41.926 --> 21:43.882
It was the demo. He heard the demo.

21:43.970 --> 21:46.677
He heard the demo
and drove down from Austin just to see you!

21:46.890 --> 21:49.632
I told you that that was a stroke of genius.

21:49.893 --> 21:53.431
Actually, he was already in town
to see Quintron and Miss Pussycat.

21:53.730 --> 21:55.595
But, yeah, he liked the demo.

21:56.065 --> 21:57.054
He liked it?

21:57.317 --> 21:59.649
Or did he "like" it?

22:01.571 --> 22:03.107
He wants to represent us.

22:04.115 --> 22:05.446
-That's great!
-(LAUGHING)

22:05.783 --> 22:07.114
That's great.

22:08.119 --> 22:09.780
But, you know, the history
of New Orleans music

22:09.871 --> 22:13.989
is replete with tales
of egregious managerial malfeasance.

22:15.210 --> 22:16.996
I know. I've heard all the stories.

22:18.087 --> 22:19.247
I haven't signed a contract yet.

22:19.464 --> 22:21.796
All right, don't, not until I read it first.

22:23.218 --> 22:24.754
Did he hit on you?

22:25.720 --> 22:26.755
Kind of, not really.

22:27.013 --> 22:28.753
Great! What does that mean?

22:29.224 --> 22:31.681
It's hard to explain. You'd have to be a girl.

22:32.310 --> 22:33.925
I mean, it's not overt, you know.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.305
It's just always there.

22:35.522 --> 22:36.637
The way he looks at you.

22:37.774 --> 22:38.809
I can handle it.

22:39.609 --> 22:41.770
He'sjust kind of, like, oozy.

22:43.613 --> 22:45.319
Oozy might be good in a manager.

22:45.490 --> 22:46.900
(CHUCKLES) You think?

22:47.784 --> 22:49.115
(JAZZ PLAYING)

23:01.381 --> 23:02.746
Come in, Jennifer. Come in.

23:04.592 --> 23:06.583
I was passing. I heard the music.

23:09.264 --> 23:10.504
Come on in.

23:12.934 --> 23:14.515
Come in.

23:18.106 --> 23:19.312
That's Papa Celestin.

23:19.607 --> 23:22.349
-You like it?
-Yeah. He from here?

23:23.152 --> 23:25.529
Oh, yeah. Where else?

23:26.489 --> 23:27.990
One of my favorites.

23:28.992 --> 23:30.152
Listen.

23:34.998 --> 23:38.490
I love it when the band
comes in on the vocals.

23:39.711 --> 23:42.999
They used to do that
a lot in the old days, Papa, Fats Waller.

23:43.214 --> 23:45.671
Yeah, always cracks me up.

23:46.217 --> 23:47.627
Call and response?

23:48.845 --> 23:50.506
Yeah, that's right.

23:50.847 --> 23:54.260
The lead sings, "Oh, Marie LaVeau,"

23:54.350 --> 23:56.762
then the guys in the band go, "Marie LaVeau."

23:57.020 --> 23:59.727
"Yes, Marie LaVeau." You sing.

24:00.106 --> 24:02.347
(SINGING) Hey, Marie LaVeau.

24:02.692 --> 24:05.183
(SINGING) Folks still believe

24:05.653 --> 24:12.274
In the Voodoo Queen

24:13.494 --> 24:18.284
Way down

24:20.168 --> 24:22.284
yonder

24:22.378 --> 24:28.965
In New Orleans

24:34.515 --> 24:36.051
-PAPA: That's it.
-(CHUCKLES)

24:39.062 --> 24:40.893
Blight is NOAH's number one concern.

24:41.439 --> 24:43.145
It affects quality of life,

24:43.232 --> 24:45.974
property values, neighborhood stabilization.

24:46.235 --> 24:48.772
The fact is that we don't have enough people

24:48.988 --> 24:51.070
-for the buildings that we have.
-WOMAN: Please.

24:51.908 --> 24:54.741
Every neighborhood in this city
has lost population since the storm,

24:54.827 --> 24:56.863
especially African-Americans,

24:56.954 --> 24:59.331
the elderly, and families with children.

24:59.499 --> 25:01.581
-We have too much housing stock.
-MAN: Really?

25:01.876 --> 25:04.333
That's good news,
because we got hundreds of people

25:04.420 --> 25:05.921
living underneath the expressway

25:06.005 --> 25:08.542
and camped out on Duncan Plaza
right across from city hall.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.290
The mayor can see it from his office.

25:10.385 --> 25:12.842
WOMAN 2: And the city and the corps
of engineers shouldn't be knocking

25:12.929 --> 25:15.966
down houses of people who
want to come back

25:16.182 --> 25:17.922
and haven't had a chance to fix them.

25:18.017 --> 25:20.303
-Ma'am...
-Or giving NOAH remediation contracts

25:20.395 --> 25:22.056
to contractors who aren't doing the work.

25:22.313 --> 25:24.349
Half a dozen empty houses
in my neighborhood,

25:24.440 --> 25:27.523
NOAH signs on them
and no work's been done, none.

25:27.610 --> 25:29.066
What the city is trying to do

25:29.153 --> 25:32.111
is put together a database
of all the unoccupied houses

25:32.198 --> 25:34.314
and then identify the ones that are blighted...

25:47.630 --> 25:51.122
WAITRESS: Just wanna let you folks know
we have our special Southern dinner tonight.

25:52.468 --> 25:54.254
Here you are. Enjoy.

25:56.764 --> 25:59.301
If I didn't know any better,
I'd think you were stalking me.

25:59.809 --> 26:01.765
-Janette Desautel.
-I know.

26:04.147 --> 26:05.262
Tim Feeny.

26:06.149 --> 26:07.855
Feeny, that's that steakhouse
in Metairie, right?

26:08.151 --> 26:11.188
My New Orleans flagship
is on Poydras in the CBD, Tim's.

26:11.446 --> 26:13.357
-Tim's, I know where that is.
-Ever eat there?

26:13.865 --> 26:16.151
I'm sorry, I don't think I've eaten
in any of your restaurants.

26:16.909 --> 26:18.649
Well, I'd be shocked if you had.

26:19.036 --> 26:20.901
I used to go to your place
on Laurel Street all the time.

26:21.247 --> 26:22.908
-Oh, really?
-You were always great.

26:22.999 --> 26:25.661
But now, a whole nother level.

26:26.335 --> 26:27.745
Oh, come on.

26:27.962 --> 26:29.702
I own a lot of restaurants, Chef,

26:30.423 --> 26:33.381
restaurants you'd never go to
and wouldn't like if you did.

26:33.676 --> 26:35.007
But they're successful.

26:35.845 --> 26:37.335
I'm sure they are.

26:37.597 --> 26:39.679
I'm looking to do something different.

26:40.349 --> 26:43.716
I want to open a great restaurant
with a great chef.

26:44.687 --> 26:46.803
And to be perfectly honest,

26:47.273 --> 26:49.355
I'd like that chef to be you.

26:49.609 --> 26:51.816
I'll tell you the same thing I told the last guy,

26:52.528 --> 26:54.689
I appreciate the interest, Mr. Feeny, I do,

26:55.740 --> 26:57.025
but I'm happy here.

26:57.283 --> 26:58.568
Would you just give it some thought?

26:58.743 --> 27:00.233
I want to do something great

27:01.162 --> 27:02.527
in New Orleans.

27:03.247 --> 27:04.828
Remember New Orleans?

27:04.916 --> 27:05.996
Every day.

27:06.542 --> 27:07.793
Think about it.

27:08.961 --> 27:11.338
I'll think about thinking about it.

27:14.008 --> 27:15.714
You know, I met this one contractor,

27:16.010 --> 27:18.376
a lady from Florida, Loretta Mortenson.

27:18.679 --> 27:20.215
Racked up a ton of NOAH jobs.

27:20.890 --> 27:21.879
How'd she get them?

27:22.141 --> 27:23.722
Maybe she's a friend of Stacey's.

27:24.227 --> 27:26.343
Stacey Jackson? Runs NOAH?

27:27.939 --> 27:30.146
-You know how many she's got?
-|mpossible to tell.

27:30.316 --> 27:32.557
There's no paper
on who's got what properties.

27:33.903 --> 27:35.484
No written contracts? No permits?

27:35.696 --> 27:37.561
Nope. Handshake and a smile.

27:38.157 --> 27:39.658
This town, you can't make it up.

27:39.867 --> 27:41.732
The NOAH program, it's federal money,

27:42.286 --> 27:45.073
but the people getting that money have
to be connected locally.

27:46.582 --> 27:47.992
Yeah, right.

27:56.509 --> 27:57.624
(SINGING) Every single minute

27:58.052 --> 27:59.553
Of every single day

27:59.887 --> 28:03.050
You wonder are you doing right
You wonder should you stay

28:03.766 --> 28:06.803
'Cause everything is broken
All the lines are down

28:06.978 --> 28:08.684
Confusion rides down every street

28:08.771 --> 28:10.432
There's rumors all around

28:10.648 --> 28:12.388
The media is black and white

28:13.401 --> 28:16.768
Politicians whine

28:18.072 --> 28:19.937
Everything is broken

28:20.283 --> 28:24.276
Except the long black line

28:29.000 --> 28:30.206
Everywhere you look

28:30.626 --> 28:31.911
Everywhere you go

28:32.295 --> 28:35.708
You read it like a book
It's the only way to know

28:35.882 --> 28:37.964
How high the water got

28:38.634 --> 28:41.797
August 29

28:43.139 --> 28:45.221
That hurricane last summer

28:45.725 --> 28:49.309
Left a long black line

28:50.730 --> 28:54.473
The long black line

28:57.278 --> 29:02.523
The long black line

29:04.994 --> 29:07.201
Hey, man, thanks. Thank you.

29:08.706 --> 29:09.821
Hey.

29:10.833 --> 29:12.869
-Hey.
-Hey, Sonny, man.

29:14.003 --> 29:15.834
-You got a haircut.
-Yeah.

29:16.005 --> 29:18.997
-Working on a shrimp boat out of Chalmette.
-No shit.

29:19.091 --> 29:20.797
-Yeah.
-(LAUGHING)

29:21.636 --> 29:23.501
Heard about The Disciples.

29:25.181 --> 29:26.421
The Apostles.

29:26.682 --> 29:28.638
Yeah. What you gonna do?

29:29.143 --> 29:31.179
You still on the street? You busking?

29:31.938 --> 29:34.099
-l'm now appearing in my living room.
-Huh.

29:34.941 --> 29:36.647
The Lightnin' is looking for somebody.

29:37.193 --> 29:38.979
-Rhythm?
-No, keyboards.

29:46.035 --> 29:49.823
Say, tomorrow night,
I was thinking of maybe going to the Hall.

29:50.373 --> 29:51.453
You trying to get on at the Hall?

29:51.832 --> 29:53.083
I Wish.

29:53.876 --> 29:55.707
It's a closed shop there.

29:57.713 --> 30:01.046
A couple of my students,
they're showing interest in trad jazz.

30:01.133 --> 30:02.248
I was thinking about taking them.

30:02.677 --> 30:04.292
That's so nice of you, Antoine.

30:04.804 --> 30:06.340
You are a good teacher.

30:07.223 --> 30:09.555
-I knew you would be.
-Yeah, you wanna come with?

30:09.725 --> 30:10.805
-The Hall?
-Uh-huh.

30:10.893 --> 30:14.727
Hell no, but you go, have fun.

30:17.233 --> 30:18.689
The thing is

30:19.735 --> 30:20.850
they're girls.

30:21.779 --> 30:24.316
I think they'd feel more comfortable
if you were there, too.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.485
-The Hall?
-You ain't never been there.

30:27.743 --> 30:30.359
-It ain't what you think.
-Sound like a snooze to me.

30:30.579 --> 30:32.080

30:51.267 --> 30:53.679
When Mortenson took you around,
she showed you a few places,

30:53.978 --> 30:56.185
told you to pick one and put lipstick on it?

30:56.981 --> 30:59.188
-Yeah.
-I need the addresses.

31:01.610 --> 31:03.271
Come on to my truck.

31:05.406 --> 31:07.943
CORNELL: High cotton, brah. High cotton.

31:08.034 --> 31:09.774
Yeah, man. True that.

31:09.869 --> 31:11.700
Sorry, sir, I don't see your name.

31:13.664 --> 31:15.780
-Antoine Batiste?
-Nope.

31:15.916 --> 31:17.122
Oh, damn.

31:18.669 --> 31:19.909

-LaDonna, my name ain't on the list.

You're shitting me.

31:30.264 --> 31:32.596
-Oh, no, I shit you not.
-All right.

31:32.683 --> 31:34.674

-Victorine, it's LaDonna.

31:46.697 --> 31:51.157
I'm so sorry to bother you.
You must be so, so busy.

31:51.243 --> 31:52.619
No, no, not at all.

31:52.703 --> 31:56.116
There seems to be some confusion
at the gatehouse.

31:56.999 --> 32:01.208
Did you happen to remember
to leave the boys' father's name,

32:01.587 --> 32:05.546
-Antoine Batiste?
-Of course I did. I am so sorry.

32:05.633 --> 32:07.999
-I will call them right now.
-Thank you.

32:12.473 --> 32:16.887
Wow, must be nice, live on a golf course.

-Do it look like I play?
-No. I play.

32:23.317 --> 32:25.182
I'd love to play that bitch.

32:27.321 --> 32:28.401
That one, too.

32:28.489 --> 32:30.730
-Hello. Antoine?
-No, ma'am.

32:30.866 --> 32:33.403
Cornell, Cornell Williams. I'm just his ride.

32:33.494 --> 32:35.155
I'm so sorry. Victorine.

32:35.538 --> 32:36.823
Antoine.

32:37.373 --> 32:38.704
So nice to finally meet you. Come on in.

32:38.791 --> 32:40.531
-Thank you much.
-Thank you.

32:41.794 --> 32:43.034
Thanks.

32:44.380 --> 32:47.292
You know, actually,
we have met a number of times.

32:48.425 --> 32:50.757
We have? I'm sorry. I don't recall.

32:50.845 --> 32:52.130

32:54.807 --> 32:56.172
You belong to those organizations?

32:56.267 --> 32:57.382
(SCOFFS) No.

32:57.518 --> 32:59.509
(LAUGHING) No, no. I'm a musician.

33:00.062 --> 33:02.053
I play the Carnival balls on occasion.

33:02.356 --> 33:04.312
Well, one meets so many people at Carnival.

33:05.276 --> 33:06.812
The boys are upstairs in their room, studying.

33:07.069 --> 33:09.105
Would you like a glass of lemonade,
Mr. Williams?

33:09.238 --> 33:10.774
Don't mind if I do.

33:11.574 --> 33:13.815
-You're not related to my husband, are you?
-The judge?

33:13.909 --> 33:15.365
-VICTORINE: Yes.
-I don't believe so.

33:15.452 --> 33:17.238
It's a common name,
Williams and all, you know?

I'm glad to see you, too.
Man, it's been a long time.

33:34.597 --> 33:36.553
Let me look at you. You're still growing.

33:37.641 --> 33:38.721
How you doing, little man? How's school?

33:38.809 --> 33:40.595
-It's good.
-All right.

33:40.978 --> 33:45.597
Hey, listen, lwanted to follow up
on what we talked about last Carnival.

33:48.194 --> 33:49.775
You know, when we were
watching the marching bands?

33:52.948 --> 33:54.688
Lessons, music lessons.

33:54.783 --> 33:55.989
Learning an instrument.

33:56.243 --> 33:57.904
I wanna get that started
now that y'all are back.

33:58.120 --> 33:59.155
Are you gonna teach us?

33:59.288 --> 34:00.277
(CHUCKLES)

34:00.956 --> 34:02.457
That depends.

34:04.376 --> 34:07.459
You thinking of playing trombone?

34:08.964 --> 34:10.500
Not really.

34:11.383 --> 34:13.715
Yeah, it's probably better
you get somebody else

34:15.095 --> 34:16.221
What about you, little man?

34:16.513 --> 34:17.923
Drums? You always bangin' on shit.

34:18.015 --> 34:19.425
Shit, I don't know.

34:21.727 --> 34:22.967
Y'all do want lessons, right?

34:23.312 --> 34:25.143
-I wanna take tennis lessons.
-Tennis?

34:25.564 --> 34:27.225
Yeah. Mom said I should ask you
if you'd pay for those.

34:27.650 --> 34:30.733
Sure, okay. But no instruments, huh?

34:31.737 --> 34:33.273
I mean, now that y'all are at St. Aug,

34:33.364 --> 34:34.945
it's a golden opportunity.

34:39.995 --> 34:41.576

Are you interested in music lessons?

-Yeah.

I'm gonna need a mixer, maybe a turntable.

Yeah.

What you've got, Albert,
is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

35:18.701 --> 35:22.569
Years of plaster dust and whatever else
we've been breathing since the storm.

Mold, heavy metals, God knows what.

35:26.542 --> 35:28.533
I've been plastering since I was 17.

35:28.627 --> 35:30.037
It never bothered me before.

35:31.547 --> 35:34.380
I'm going to give you some breathing
exercises and prescribe an inhaler.

35:37.720 --> 35:38.800
This gonna fix it?

but you can prevent it from getting worse.

-All right.

of the blood work gets back.

36:33.108 --> 36:36.191
Much loved by critics, by customers.
And you know why?

36:36.653 --> 36:39.110
Because from day one,
these guys did whatever the fuck they wanted.

36:39.323 --> 36:41.530
They didn't give a shit
what the market told them to cook.

36:41.784 --> 36:43.900
They figured out who they were,
what they were good at,

36:43.994 --> 36:45.825
what they wanted to do, and they did that.

36:46.080 --> 36:48.446
Which is where I'm going with this.

go through it all again,

37:10.479 --> 37:11.685
being the boss.

37:12.064 --> 37:13.270
This time you'll have a partner.

You won't have to deal with the bullshit,
permits, insurance, inspectors.

37:17.694 --> 37:19.525
The bullshit, that's myjob.

-What am I supposed to tell the boys?
-Nothing.

37:23.575 --> 37:25.566
-Excuse me?
-l'm their mother. I'll tell them.

37:25.661 --> 37:27.652
-What are you gonna tell them?
-The truth,

37:28.831 --> 37:33.825
that I cannot stay under the same roof
as your brother and his wife,

37:34.002 --> 37:35.333
not one more night.

the constant criticism of the boys, I've had it.

37:44.680 --> 37:45.760
LaDonna, you just...

37:45.848 --> 37:49.557
And you can tell them that I will pick them up
every morning and take them to school.

37:49.726 --> 37:51.307
You're gonna run back and forth like that?

37:51.520 --> 37:54.978
It's just temporary until we get our own place.

37:59.528 --> 38:01.359
And I'm gonna tell them that, too.

43:11.298 --> 43:13.004

43:14.176 --> 43:15.916
I was curious to see how they were coming,

43:16.553 --> 43:17.838
so I checked them out.

43:18.221 --> 43:19.552
First one's a vacant lot.

43:19.848 --> 43:21.258
Second one's been completely rehabbed

so I stopped to help.

46:35.877 --> 46:36.866
Hmm.

46:38.380 --> 46:39.870
They tell you what happened to him?

46:40.090 --> 46:42.206
They said his brother and a friend
had went up to the strip mall

46:42.592 --> 46:43.752
looking for necessities.

46:43.843 --> 46:45.583
Somebody shot him in the chest.

46:48.556 --> 46:50.342
The guy who got shot,
did they tell you his name?

46:50.600 --> 46:52.682
King. Brother said his name was King.

46:54.562 --> 46:57.144
So we get him in the back seat
and take off, me and his brother.

46:57.232 --> 46:59.518
He's bleeding bad and I don't think
he's gonna make it to West Jeff,

46:59.651 --> 47:00.640
so I drive to the school...

47:00.735 --> 47:02.020
-The hospital?
-Right.

So I drive to the school
about half a mile from here.
