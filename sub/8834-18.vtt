01:09.041 --> 01:10.000
Hey, watch it.

01:10.083 --> 01:14.000
"Our fair city applauds..."
Excuse me, please.

01:14.083 --> 01:19.417
"Applauds the dignitaries..."
Why... Sorry, now, let me see.

01:19.542 --> 01:22.500
"Dignitaries who've
traveled around the globe--"

01:22.583 --> 01:23.875
-[crashing]
-Watch it.

01:23.959 --> 01:26.792
"To join us in goodwill and brotherhood."

01:27.875 --> 01:30.834
[Kit]
Wow! Look at all the planes, Baloo!

01:30.917 --> 01:34.917
A Croman C-60 and a Zabriskie 1-11.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.208
[Baloo] Yeah. There's a Krelmin Special
from Nosenbeak.

01:39.291 --> 01:41.208
[Kit] This is great.

01:41.291 --> 01:44.333
Yup, little britches.
Aviation heaven.

01:44.500 --> 01:48.750
Red hots!
Get your delicious, red-hot hot dogs.

01:49.125 --> 01:54.083
Special Friendship Festival price: $3.98.

01:55.875 --> 02:00.542
OK, $3.00...
Uh, 98 cents?

02:01.000 --> 02:03.208
Mm, probably just had breakfast.

02:03.291 --> 02:06.667
Aw... we'll get rich selling them
once the Friendship Festival begins.

02:06.750 --> 02:08.083
Won't we, Papa Bear?

02:08.291 --> 02:10.417
[Baloo]
Can you think of a friendlier food?

02:13.166 --> 02:14.792
Can't say I can.

02:29.458 --> 02:30.792
[both]
Thembrian.

02:35.750 --> 02:41.041
Ah, Cape Suzette, the soft,
white underbelly of the world.

02:41.125 --> 02:43.917
[sniffing]
Smell the decadence.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.166
[grunts]

02:45.250 --> 02:48.959
[sniffing] Smells a little like hot dogs
to me, sir, I think.

02:49.166 --> 02:52.875
Stop with the hot dogs, Sergeant Dunder!
We have more important things to do.

02:53.125 --> 02:56.542
First, where do we go to get processed?

02:56.834 --> 02:59.500
I'm always ready for
the proper forms and paperwork.

02:59.583 --> 03:03.667
Um, I don't think they do any
of those things here, colonel, sir.

03:03.750 --> 03:08.291
No triplicate E-118s?
No day-long line?

03:08.375 --> 03:09.583
Sorry.

03:09.667 --> 03:12.333
What way's this to run a country?

03:12.417 --> 03:14.542
It's my fault, sir.

03:14.625 --> 03:18.542
Never mind! I will go see
if preparations are in order

03:18.625 --> 03:21.542
for my grand presentation
of the highly coveted

03:21.625 --> 03:25.500
and very valuable
Thembrian Golden Sprocket.

03:25.583 --> 03:28.875
Stay and guard it
as if your life depends on it.

03:29.458 --> 03:30.291
Because it does.

03:30.583 --> 03:35.834
Remember, this is a friendship festival.
You can't trust anyone.

03:35.917 --> 03:39.792
I am Colonel Spigot.
You may have heard of me.

03:44.250 --> 03:48.625
Whatever's in that box is valuable,
so we're gonna steal it.

03:48.917 --> 03:51.250
-Yeah, steal.
-Yeah, we won't pay.

03:51.333 --> 03:56.583
And that hot dog guy's giving me
a great idea for a disguise and getaway.

03:56.667 --> 03:59.375
[Baloo] Well, hey, hey, Dunder.

03:59.458 --> 04:03.709
You can't have the very valuable
gold sprocket unless you get by me first.

04:03.792 --> 04:06.500
-Mr. Baloo?
-And me, Kit.

04:06.583 --> 04:11.041
-We're getting rich selling hot dogs.
-I love hot dogs.

04:11.125 --> 04:16.416
-On the house, 'cause we're pals.
-Thanks.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.959
You won't tell Colonel Spigot?

04:19.041 --> 04:21.000
He doesn't like eating on duty.

04:21.083 --> 04:23.333
He'd probably have me shot... or worse.

04:23.417 --> 04:27.166
Oh, mum's the word, Dunder.
Now, if you'll excuse us--

04:27.250 --> 04:30.834
Baloo! I knew I'd find you two down here.

04:30.917 --> 04:33.792
And what is this ridiculous outfit?

04:33.875 --> 04:38.250
-Fortune, lady. Fortune.
-I'll fortune you.

04:38.333 --> 04:41.208
You haul your hot dog bun outta here,
right now.

04:41.291 --> 04:43.375
I'm moving. I'm moving.

04:51.583 --> 04:55.291
Piano. Address. Deliver.

04:55.375 --> 04:57.750
But, Becky, that'll take all day.

04:57.834 --> 05:00.959
Oh... We were going to
work the crowd at the festival.

05:01.041 --> 05:06.500
Fine! Sell your hot dogs
after you move the piano.

05:06.917 --> 05:08.625
[grunting]

05:12.375 --> 05:14.667
Hey! Move your keys, hot dog.

05:14.750 --> 05:17.291
I'm going fast as I can.

05:25.375 --> 05:26.500
Road hog!

05:26.583 --> 05:28.000
[groans]

05:28.083 --> 05:32.750
-Kit, we need help.
-Right, Papa Bear.

05:32.834 --> 05:38.125
Someone big, willing, and likes hot dogs.

05:38.208 --> 05:40.583
You got any ideas?

05:40.667 --> 05:44.208
This will disguise you.
No one will know.

05:44.291 --> 05:47.834
But, Mr. Baloo,
I can't desert my post.

05:47.917 --> 05:50.500
I'm pretty sure Colonel Spigot
will rip out my spleen

05:50.583 --> 05:52.583
or maybe do something really bad to me.

05:52.667 --> 05:56.375
[Baloo] Oh, you're loyal.
I like that in a Thembrian.

05:56.458 --> 06:00.917
-But... I have a problem.
-I have some salve.

06:01.166 --> 06:05.625
No, it's... Well, I thought
we were buddies, friends, maybe.

06:05.709 --> 06:08.375
-Well--
-[Baloo] And friends help each other.

06:08.458 --> 06:13.583
Now, If I don't deliver that piano,
I'm gonna be in big, big trouble.

06:13.667 --> 06:17.625
-Gosh, I don't want you to get in trouble.
-Then you'll help?

06:17.709 --> 06:21.166
I guess.
We'll be back before Colonel Spigot does?

06:21.250 --> 06:25.250
Of course, pal.
Have a hot dog.

06:26.917 --> 06:30.500
[grunts] Almost there, Dundy.
Just a few more...

06:35.291 --> 06:36.208
[crashing]

06:40.500 --> 06:41.500
[doorbell rings]

06:41.583 --> 06:43.166
Come on.
Come on.

06:43.250 --> 06:45.250
Well, they're probably at the festival.

06:45.333 --> 06:49.792
And hankering for a Baloo Friendship
Special with everything.

06:49.875 --> 06:51.125
Come on, let's go.

06:51.208 --> 06:54.834
-But I have to get back to--
-It's on our way, pal.

06:54.917 --> 06:58.917
Now, we'll just peek at the crowd
and see if they're getting hungry yet.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.500
-I'll let you push the cart.
-Really?

07:03.583 --> 07:05.959
[Kit]
Hot doggers, here we come.

07:08.583 --> 07:12.667
And those were
the Prancing Pygmies from Patagoiter

07:12.750 --> 07:15.875
doing their ritual rain conga dance.

07:15.959 --> 07:20.542
Look, I'm going to tell you guys
one more time.

07:20.625 --> 07:23.375
We're not selling hot dogs!

07:23.458 --> 07:26.375
-No hot dogs.
-No cats or dogs.

07:26.458 --> 07:30.375
-Yeah, no...
-Then why are we dressed like this?

07:31.917 --> 07:35.417
To fool the guy at the airport!

07:35.500 --> 07:39.625
-Oh, right.
-Oh, the fool at the airport.

07:40.583 --> 07:44.583
And if he's not fooled,
we blast him with the TNT.

07:44.667 --> 07:46.625
-Got it?
-[both] Right.

07:46.709 --> 07:48.417
Hey, you.
I'll take a hot dog.

07:48.500 --> 07:52.083
-OK.
-Sorry. All out.

07:52.166 --> 07:54.125
But you have one in your hand.

07:54.208 --> 07:57.458
-So, catch.
-Thanks.

07:57.542 --> 07:59.291
Boom appétit.

08:05.375 --> 08:06.834
-[all grunting]
-[alligator] Hey, watch it!

08:08.458 --> 08:10.291
Oh-ho, competition.

08:10.375 --> 08:13.291
This is my turf!
You weeny raiders have a permit?

08:13.375 --> 08:15.667
-Permit?
-Just like I thought.

08:15.750 --> 08:20.500
-Police! Police!
-Shh! OK, OK. We're going.

08:20.583 --> 08:23.959
[laughing]
Boy, did you see them run?

08:24.041 --> 08:28.792
Permits.
Oh, boy. Sometimes I crack myself up.

08:28.875 --> 08:30.917
-Look.
-[Baloo] Uh-oh.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.332
Come on. Run.

08:32.417 --> 08:36.291
[gorilla] OK. The boss is sure
talking funny, though.

08:40.207 --> 08:42.332
[panting]
Made it.

08:42.417 --> 08:45.750
You gotta get up pretty early
in the afternoon to fool old Baloo.

08:45.834 --> 08:47.500
[Colonel Spigot]
What is going on here?

08:47.583 --> 08:51.000
Why are people wearing
silly outfits near my plane?

08:51.083 --> 08:57.166
Uh... I was just showing the sarge
the new line of Cape Suzette uniforms.

08:57.250 --> 09:00.500
They're part of the hot dog commandoes.

09:00.959 --> 09:04.667
Only an idiot would believe
a story like that.

09:04.750 --> 09:09.250
Hot Dog Commandoes?
I should inform the high marshal.

09:09.333 --> 09:13.667
He would probably be interested
in having hot dog commandoes of his own.

09:13.750 --> 09:17.583
Sergeant Dunder,
my official Thembrian notepad.

09:19.291 --> 09:20.792
I'm speaking to you,

09:20.875 --> 09:24.458
Sergeant Soon-to-be-shot
if-you-don't-answer Dunder.

09:26.875 --> 09:30.291
-You're not Sergeant Dunder.
-I'm not?

09:30.583 --> 09:33.500
Why aren't you Sergeant Dunder?
Why aren't you Sergeant Dunder?

09:33.583 --> 09:36.000
I don't know. Why?

09:36.083 --> 09:41.125
-Answer me. Stop playing dumb.
-I don't think he's playing.

09:41.208 --> 09:44.083
Say, Spiggy, the sarge was with me.

09:44.166 --> 09:45.709
He'll turn up.

09:45.792 --> 09:48.375
He was just being friendly.

09:48.458 --> 09:51.333
He's not a friendly.
He's a Thembrian!

09:51.875 --> 09:53.917
Now, I want to know what's going on here.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.333
What? What? What?

09:56.458 --> 10:00.834
[laughing]
Well, I'm not supposed to tell,

10:00.917 --> 10:04.166
but we're going to steal
what's in the box.

10:05.291 --> 10:07.875
-Oops.
-Steal the Golden Sprocket?

10:07.959 --> 10:12.875
-Steal the Golden Sprocket?
-Shh. It's a big secret.

10:12.959 --> 10:14.542
The Sprocket!

10:24.917 --> 10:26.792
[sighs]
It's safe.

10:26.875 --> 10:28.208
Your doohickey's OK?

10:28.625 --> 10:30.625
Yes, the doohickey's OK,

10:30.709 --> 10:33.500
no thanks to you
and your Cape Suzette ways.

10:33.583 --> 10:36.166
Friends, indeed.
Find Sergeant Dunder.

10:36.250 --> 10:37.917
I shall stand guard.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.500
My speech is at 6:00.

10:39.583 --> 10:43.542
If you're not back by then,
it's going to be war! War, war!

10:44.583 --> 10:51.500
How about a big Cape Suzettian hand
for the Juggling Jackals of Jackalmanka?

10:51.583 --> 10:52.875
[grunting]

10:53.750 --> 10:55.291
[scattered applause]

10:56.959 --> 11:00.417
[Kit] Dunder!
Sergeant Dunder!

11:00.500 --> 11:02.291
Here, boy.
[whistles]

11:02.375 --> 11:04.250
Where are you?

11:04.333 --> 11:08.208
Baloo? There's no way he could've
delivered that piano yet.

11:08.291 --> 11:12.250
Hut, two, three, four.
Hut, two, three, five.

11:12.333 --> 11:14.458
Hut, two...
Halt!

11:14.583 --> 11:17.083
Oh, you're back.
You found my sergeant?

11:17.166 --> 11:21.166
Sergeant? We're just your friendly
neighborhood hot dog vendors.

11:21.250 --> 11:25.500
Yeah, we're not crooks or nothing.
[grunts]

11:25.583 --> 11:29.166
-Hot dogs? Hot dogs?
-Hand over what's in the box.

11:29.250 --> 11:31.959
The Golden Sprocket?
Never!

11:32.041 --> 11:33.375
Where's Baloo?

11:33.458 --> 11:37.125
What's this, a bogus poupon?
Where's my other goon?

11:37.208 --> 11:40.667
Ah-ha! Now it's two against two.

11:40.750 --> 11:44.959
Come on, Sergeant Dunder.
Now we've got you outnumbered.

11:45.083 --> 11:48.375
If you won't open the door,
we'll just blast our way in.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.375
-Blast our way in.
-[gorilla] Yeah, boom-boom.

11:50.458 --> 11:53.125
Please, not my Sprocket.
[groans]

11:53.208 --> 11:55.000
Help!
Help--

12:20.375 --> 12:22.083
Hey, it's full of weenies.

12:22.166 --> 12:26.500
Uh, boss, don't you think the dynamite
would have worked better?

12:26.583 --> 12:28.333
Yeah, yeah, with the boom and the--

12:28.667 --> 12:30.667
All right, who's got my dynamite?

12:33.542 --> 12:36.959
-Uh, excuse me, I'd like a hot dog.
-Finally!

12:37.041 --> 12:39.667
Mister, you came to the right guy.

12:39.750 --> 12:42.625
-[Rebecca] Baloo!
-[both] Uh-oh.

12:49.709 --> 12:52.083
A million-jillion people at the festival.

12:52.166 --> 12:55.166
You'd think we'd find
one little old sergeant.

12:55.250 --> 12:58.625
We were the ones who did kinda
lose him in the first place.

12:58.709 --> 13:01.083
I hope he's, all right, Baloo.

13:01.166 --> 13:06.250
So, you want me to get tough, hey?
Now, one of youse has a key. Talk.

13:06.333 --> 13:07.417
[mumbling]

13:07.500 --> 13:11.250
-Can't understand a thing.
-He said something.

13:11.333 --> 13:14.417
[gags] Sergeant Dunder,
swallow the key, quickly!

13:14.500 --> 13:15.667
That's an order.

13:15.750 --> 13:16.750
[gulps]

13:16.834 --> 13:18.792
Now try and get it.

13:18.875 --> 13:23.041
[chuckles]
Boys, the key, please.

13:23.125 --> 13:26.917
-Yeah, the key.
-I'll get the key.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.667
Colonel!

13:32.709 --> 13:36.417
How are we gonna tell Colonel Spigot
that we couldn't find Sergeant Dunder?

13:36.500 --> 13:39.583
-Beats me, little britches.
-Baloo, look!

13:39.667 --> 13:42.417
Hey, Spiggy, Dundy.

13:42.500 --> 13:46.333
I told you we'd find the sarge.
Now we can go sell hot dogs.

13:46.417 --> 13:48.709
Get me down from here!
Get me down from here!

13:48.792 --> 13:50.834
I don't feel too good.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.250
-What happened?
-They stole the Sprocket.

13:57.333 --> 13:58.959
They stole the Sprocket.

13:59.041 --> 14:01.625
You're to blame, and you're to blame.
And you and you!

14:01.709 --> 14:06.083
And especially you, sergeant.
I'm going to send for my firing squad.

14:06.166 --> 14:07.667
All the way from home?

14:07.750 --> 14:10.792
You'll all be shot!
Especially you, Sergeant Dunder.

14:10.875 --> 14:12.834
You'll have to be shot twice.

14:16.083 --> 14:20.208
Six o'clock. Don't you have
a presentation to make, Spiggy?

14:20.875 --> 14:25.875
Presentation? I have to present
the Golden Sprocket to the mayor.

14:25.959 --> 14:29.291
-Yeah?
-And there's no Sprocket to present.

14:29.375 --> 14:33.333
-When the high marshal finds out--
-[both] He'll have you shot.

14:33.875 --> 14:35.542
The firing squad.

14:36.375 --> 14:39.875
Oh, no, sir, that could never happen.

14:39.959 --> 14:41.959
The penalty for losing
international awards is

14:42.041 --> 14:44.000
being fed alive to polar bears.

14:44.083 --> 14:47.667
Polar bears?!
I don't want to go like Grandma.

14:47.792 --> 14:52.000
-You've got to do something.
-Hey, no problem.

14:52.083 --> 14:54.458
We'll find your golden doohickey.

14:54.542 --> 14:59.667
-But I must present it now.
-So stall.

14:59.750 --> 15:02.500
Tell a few jokes, you know.

15:02.583 --> 15:05.834
Yeah, yeah, jokes. Tell a few I know.
Sure, yeah.

15:05.917 --> 15:07.208
Now, how did that one go?

15:07.291 --> 15:10.125
Ah, why did the flightless waterfowl
cross the runway?

15:10.208 --> 15:12.208
He didn't. Good one...
[muttering]

15:12.917 --> 15:15.583
Knock 'em dead.
We'd better hurry.

15:15.667 --> 15:19.083
I got a feeling
it's going to be a tough audience.

15:19.583 --> 15:23.083
Hey, aren't they terrific, folks?
The Mongwillian Mimes?

15:23.166 --> 15:28.834
-Good idea, hiding box in weeny cart.
-[gorilla] Yeah, good weeny idea.

15:28.917 --> 15:31.000
Yeah, good idea.
My first.

15:31.083 --> 15:35.583
It would've been better if you'd remember
to take out the weenies first!

15:35.667 --> 15:39.041
Baloo! You haven't delivered
that piano, have you?

15:39.125 --> 15:42.083
-[alligator] Who's the dame?
-[gorilla] What dame?

15:42.166 --> 15:45.792
-I haven't the faintest.
-What happened to your voice, Kit?

15:45.875 --> 15:48.875
Kit? Sorry, lady.
Wrong pickle.

15:48.959 --> 15:50.709
-Get rid of her.
-Yeah.

15:50.792 --> 15:52.583
[gorilla] Yeah, OK, bye-bye now.

15:52.917 --> 15:56.083
Hey, wait a minute.
Put me down!

15:56.166 --> 15:59.625
Hey, what're you doing?
Baloo! Kit!

16:00.834 --> 16:05.959
And, now, straight from Thembria,
I'd like to present Colonel, uh, Spigot.

16:08.834 --> 16:10.667
[clears throat]
Yes.

16:10.750 --> 16:14.667
Good evening, ladies, and, ladies...
gentlemen, people.

16:14.750 --> 16:18.500
So...
How many of you are from Thembria?

16:20.792 --> 16:23.417
I tell you, Thembrian lines are the worst.

16:23.500 --> 16:28.250
I once stood in a line so long,
I had to set my watch back an hour.

16:28.333 --> 16:31.500
[chuckles] An hour because of
the time zone difference.

16:31.583 --> 16:37.417
[Dunder] Oh, a firing squad just for me.
I'm honored.

16:37.500 --> 16:42.458
Colonel Spigot must really like me.
Oh, I wish I hadn't let him down.

16:42.542 --> 16:45.375
He needed me and I wasn't there.
Ohh...

16:45.458 --> 16:46.291
Yeah?

16:46.375 --> 16:49.041
We kinda got him
in a bunch of trouble, didn't we?

16:49.125 --> 16:51.250
Mm, yeah, maybe a little.

16:51.333 --> 16:53.583
[Dunder]
I wonder if they'll give me a blindfold.

16:53.667 --> 16:57.291
Well, maybe a lot.
Hey, Dunder, pal.

16:57.375 --> 17:02.417
I got something I wanna say.
It's just, well...

17:02.500 --> 17:05.750
-I've been a weeny.
-You?

17:05.834 --> 17:11.875
Yeah. You helped me like a friend,
and I've gotten you in hot water.

17:11.959 --> 17:15.290
It's all right. I don't mind.
It's only a firing squad.

17:15.375 --> 17:17.791
Look, I'll get you out of this,
I promise.

17:17.875 --> 17:21.458
-We'll find that Golden Sprocket.
-For me?

17:21.541 --> 17:24.040
That's what friends are for, right?

17:24.125 --> 17:28.165
[chuckles] And then the doctor
asks the man, "What's wrong?"

17:28.250 --> 17:29.542
The penguin replies,

17:29.625 --> 17:34.125
"I'm not sure, but I've got this guy
under my feet that I can't get rid of."

17:34.208 --> 17:36.083
[chuckles]

17:36.166 --> 17:38.000
Ah, you've heard this one before?

17:42.375 --> 17:44.917
[man]
What? A piano!

17:50.291 --> 17:52.750
[Rebecca]
Let me out of here!

17:52.834 --> 17:55.208
Hey!
There are those weeny robbers.

17:55.667 --> 17:57.000
After the Sprocket!

17:57.083 --> 17:59.208
[yelling]

17:59.625 --> 18:01.959
Baloo, what are you doing?

18:02.041 --> 18:04.166
[yells]

18:04.250 --> 18:05.709
Grab that cart!

18:07.625 --> 18:09.125
Help!

18:11.959 --> 18:13.625
Gotta get that Sprocket!

18:14.041 --> 18:15.542
Faster! Faster!

18:24.792 --> 18:27.834
[yelling]

18:29.667 --> 18:31.291
[crashing]

18:31.375 --> 18:32.667
Got it! Got it!

18:32.750 --> 18:34.542
Mr. Baloo?

18:37.750 --> 18:39.792
[humming]

18:44.750 --> 18:46.625
[crowd jeering]

18:46.709 --> 18:50.583
Hey, I thought this was
a friendship festival.

18:51.041 --> 18:52.667
[bell dings]

18:53.792 --> 18:54.959
[bell dings]

19:00.583 --> 19:01.917
[yells]

19:04.041 --> 19:09.125
[alligator] No, you idiot! I told you
to get the cart. I didn't mean from me!

19:09.792 --> 19:10.875
Take that.

19:11.458 --> 19:12.750
[yells]

19:17.458 --> 19:20.208
[panting]
Are you all right, Miss Cunningham?

19:20.291 --> 19:21.667
No, I'm not.

19:23.208 --> 19:26.917
One Golden Sprocket for my friend Dunder.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.417
For me?

19:28.500 --> 19:32.750
No, for me.
Hand over the box.

19:36.333 --> 19:39.083
At last, it's mine!
[laughs]

19:39.166 --> 19:41.083
-[rumbling]
-What now?

19:44.375 --> 19:45.834
Run!

19:47.500 --> 19:50.083
Wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait.
There's more.

19:50.166 --> 19:51.834
[explosion]

20:03.417 --> 20:08.333
Mr. Mayor, the Thembrian
Golden Sprocket of Friendship.

20:08.458 --> 20:13.041
-Uh, thank you, Colonel Nozzle.
-That's Spigot.

20:15.750 --> 20:18.834
Odd customs these Thembrians have.

20:19.625 --> 20:23.667
What a presentation!
The high marshal will be proud.

20:23.750 --> 20:25.542
People said they've never
seen anything like it.

20:25.625 --> 20:29.417
[gasps]
Maybe I'm in the wrong line of work.

20:29.500 --> 20:33.709
Maybe I should go into,
dare I say it, show biz.

20:35.083 --> 20:37.125
I wanna thank you, Baloo.

20:37.208 --> 20:39.333
Colonel Spigot said
I won't have to be shot

20:39.417 --> 20:41.208
now that everything's worked out so well.

20:41.291 --> 20:42.917
He said a simple flogging will do.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.083
Well, good for you, Dundy.

20:45.166 --> 20:48.834
I'm sorry I got you
into this in the first place.

20:48.917 --> 20:52.166
And we never did sell
a single hot dog, Baloo.

20:52.250 --> 20:55.542
Well, no, but we made a lot of friends,

20:55.625 --> 20:59.458
and isn't that what the
friendship festival's all about, Kit?

20:59.542 --> 21:01.750
Nice try, Papa Bear.

21:14.750 --> 21:16.041
[rumbling]

21:16.125 --> 21:18.375
Baloo, about this piano...

21:18.458 --> 21:22.667
Well, honest, Becky,
we delivered it to where you told us.

21:22.750 --> 21:26.333
Uh, that's what I was trying to tell you.

21:26.417 --> 21:29.792
I gave you the wrong address.

21:33.166 --> 21:36.458
[groans]
Why me, Kit? Why me?

21:36.542 --> 21:39.625
[Kit]
Hey, Baloo, you know what they say.

21:39.709 --> 21:42.458
It's a dog-eat-dog world.
[laughing]

21:42.542 --> 21:47.500
[Baloo] Kit, if this piano pushing
don't kill me, your jokes sure will.
