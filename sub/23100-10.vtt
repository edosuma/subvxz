01:24.291 --> 01:26.833
Mm-mm. Mmm.

01:29.875 --> 01:33.166
Two crick-adjustments here, and, uh...

01:33.250 --> 01:34.958
Oh.

01:35.041 --> 01:37.291
I'm sorry. Did I wake you?

01:37.375 --> 01:40.000
-Mm-mm. Is it finished?
-Is it? Is it?

01:40.083 --> 01:42.708
Not quite. I just need a bit more time.

01:42.791 --> 01:46.083
Don't rush, Crick. Sometimes good things
just take time, don't they?

01:52.750 --> 01:53.833
Whoa!

01:53.916 --> 01:57.000
What--? What's happening?
What's going on?

02:02.416 --> 02:05.291
Well, hello!

02:05.375 --> 02:09.750
Aren't you all just so adorable?

02:12.708 --> 02:16.500
Connie's the name.
Delighted to meet you.

02:16.583 --> 02:19.583
-Even though it wasn't on my list.
-What list?

02:19.666 --> 02:22.916
Oh, the list of things I have to do
while I'm above ground.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.416
It's a long list, and I'm short on time.

02:26.500 --> 02:29.833
Oh, wow! What do you call that?

02:33.041 --> 02:34.708
That's just grass.

02:35.833 --> 02:39.083
I knew it! That's one down.

02:39.791 --> 02:42.833
Grass. Amazing.

02:42.916 --> 02:45.958
You've never seen grass before?

02:46.041 --> 02:50.750
Oh, ha-ha, of course not, silly.
I'm a cicada.

02:50.833 --> 02:54.041
I've been underground for seven years,

02:54.125 --> 02:56.708
eating nothing but sap.

02:56.791 --> 03:00.916
Not that I'm complaining. I love sap.

03:02.333 --> 03:03.708
Ooh.

03:03.791 --> 03:06.791
Now what do you call that?

03:06.875 --> 03:11.625
Well, you see, uh, it's...
It's not quite ready.

03:11.708 --> 03:13.416
It's ready, it's ready, it's ready!

03:13.500 --> 03:16.125
-Jay, I haven't had enough time!
-It's ready.

03:18.750 --> 03:22.375
Well, aren't you
the cute creative one?

03:22.458 --> 03:26.458
This is the best, most fabulous...

03:26.541 --> 03:28.166
What is it exactly?

03:28.250 --> 03:29.333
Oh, uh...

03:29.416 --> 03:32.458
The latest in bug transportation.

03:32.541 --> 03:36.416
-I call it--
-Bug transportation, eh?

03:40.708 --> 03:43.000
Could your crickto-thingy take us there?

03:43.083 --> 03:45.875
You mean, the Big House?

03:45.958 --> 03:49.250
Getting to the Big House is my number one,

03:49.333 --> 03:51.958
top of the charts, lifelong dream!

03:52.750 --> 03:54.333
Me too.

03:55.083 --> 03:56.083
Oh.

03:56.166 --> 04:00.750
Sorry, but I still have
to figure out the, uh, fuel mix.

04:01.541 --> 04:07.541
I need something a little sticky,
a little runny and a little...

04:07.625 --> 04:10.541
A little sappy?

04:10.625 --> 04:14.041
Well, um... possibly.

04:14.125 --> 04:16.833
Then start her up, smart guy.

04:18.750 --> 04:21.750
I don't think you should let
anyone rush you, if it's not ready.

04:21.833 --> 04:23.916
Of course it's ready. Let's go!

04:27.791 --> 04:30.833
- Awesome! It works!
- Yes. Great. I knew it.

04:30.916 --> 04:33.791
You totally owe me a ride
to the Big House now.

04:36.291 --> 04:38.083
I-I just need to, uh...

04:38.166 --> 04:40.666
make a few final adjustments.

04:40.750 --> 04:42.125
Just make them on the way!

04:42.208 --> 04:45.083
-You're a clever cricket.
-The cleverest!

04:45.166 --> 04:47.416
Okay, as long as we're home before dark.

04:47.500 --> 04:50.958
-Why? What happens then?
-Don't you remember?

04:51.041 --> 04:52.541
Bad Blue.

04:57.125 --> 04:58.750
Now I 'member.

04:58.833 --> 05:01.750
That thing gives me
the heebies.

05:01.833 --> 05:04.333
If we're going, we need to go now.

05:04.416 --> 05:05.541
Hmm.

05:05.625 --> 05:08.166
There's something about cicadas...

05:08.250 --> 05:09.833
Something...

05:09.916 --> 05:12.375
I remember that, uh...

05:12.458 --> 05:16.375
First, tiny eggs hatch into cicada nymphs.

05:16.458 --> 05:19.833
The nymphs spend seven years
underground feeding on sap.

05:19.916 --> 05:25.083
A fully grown cicada then digs
its way to the surface and--

05:25.166 --> 05:27.333
- Crick!
- Come on, Crick.

05:27.416 --> 05:32.083
-Let's go, go, go!
-Ah... Yes, coming.

05:32.166 --> 05:35.541
You have enough sap
to get us there and back, correct?

05:35.625 --> 05:37.000
Oh, mmm.

05:37.083 --> 05:40.583
Oh! Of course. Now, hit it.

05:41.666 --> 05:43.250
Uh... ready?

05:43.333 --> 05:47.416
Here we go!

06:09.375 --> 06:12.416
Uh, hello? I'm on a schedule here.

06:13.083 --> 06:14.750
Can we go faster?

06:14.833 --> 06:16.916
Of course we can.

06:19.083 --> 06:20.250
Mind if I have a go?

06:20.333 --> 06:21.375
Uh...

06:21.458 --> 06:24.958
I... I guess. That is, if you're careful.

06:47.833 --> 06:50.291
It's okay. I can do this.

07:00.125 --> 07:02.958
Oh, man.

07:03.041 --> 07:04.291
That was so...

07:04.375 --> 07:05.708
Awesome.

07:09.833 --> 07:11.625
Everything's gone dark.

07:11.708 --> 07:15.291
I can't see. I can't see! I can't...

07:15.375 --> 07:17.833
I can see! I can see!

07:30.166 --> 07:31.416
Let's see.

07:31.500 --> 07:33.541
Ah, looks like...

07:33.625 --> 07:36.416
Well, no major damage, luckily.

07:36.500 --> 07:39.250
Great. So, how long to get it fixed?

07:39.333 --> 07:41.833
Well, a snapped crickto-matic valve,

07:41.916 --> 07:44.500
crickta-drive may need attenuation--

07:44.583 --> 07:46.500
Cut to the chase. How long?

07:46.583 --> 07:48.458
Just... Just give him some time.

07:48.541 --> 07:49.958
I don't have any time.

07:50.041 --> 07:51.583
It's okay.

07:51.666 --> 07:53.375
You can have some of mine.

07:53.458 --> 07:55.666
Oh, that's real nice of you,

07:55.750 --> 07:59.166
but time is one thing
you can't borrow or lend.

07:59.250 --> 08:03.166
Everyone has their share,
and they spend it how they choose.

08:03.250 --> 08:06.583
I plan to spend mine getting
to the Big House, heh,

08:06.666 --> 08:09.125
so I really have to go.

08:09.208 --> 08:12.625
What's the hurry?
You can try again tomorrow!

08:12.708 --> 08:14.583
Yeah! Tomorrow!

08:19.708 --> 08:22.708
W-Wait, you can't leave.

08:22.791 --> 08:25.125
What about the sap you promised?

08:25.208 --> 08:27.291
We need it to get home.

08:31.958 --> 08:33.916
I'm real sorry,

08:34.000 --> 08:38.207
but I got a long journey ahead
and I need to eat.

08:38.291 --> 08:41.582
But, thanks, for everything.

08:42.125 --> 08:44.125
I know you're a clever cricket

08:44.207 --> 08:46.250
and you'll work something out.

08:46.333 --> 08:49.333
And this? This is my one shot.

09:00.250 --> 09:03.666
She only gets one day.

09:04.291 --> 09:06.333

We should have listened to you.

11:50.083 --> 11:52.791
-From the very beginning.
-It's okay, guys.

11:52.875 --> 11:55.458
Some of us just need
more time than others.

11:55.541 --> 11:56.666
Wow.

11:57.083 --> 11:59.541
I wonder if she made it.

12:01.750 --> 12:04.000
-Good evening, good evening.
-Hi, Postman Bee!

12:04.083 --> 12:06.708
Special delivery for Crick.

12:06.791 --> 12:09.041
It's direct from the Big House.

12:33.250 --> 12:34.875
I'm gonna get you!

12:39.625 --> 12:41.666
Hey, watch it!

12:44.416 --> 12:46.791
Everybody say,
"Happy Birthday, Katter the Pillar."

12:46.875 --> 12:49.833
Happy Birthday, Katter!

12:53.250 --> 12:56.583
This is our bestest costume party ever!

12:56.666 --> 12:59.291
This is our bestest birthday party ever.

12:59.375 --> 13:01.333
This is our happiest birthday party ever.

13:01.416 --> 13:05.083
That's why they call it a happy birthday.

13:05.166 --> 13:07.916
Uh... Where's your costume, Katter?

13:08.000 --> 13:10.166
I-I wasn't feeling--

13:10.250 --> 13:12.291
I... I ran out of time.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.291
I really wish I had made a costume.

13:14.375 --> 13:15.625
I made you leaf cakes.

13:18.875 --> 13:19.875
Mmm.

13:19.958 --> 13:22.666
You get the first cake, and... and...

13:22.750 --> 13:24.083
I'll take the second cake.

13:29.500 --> 13:31.541
It's very nice,

13:31.625 --> 13:35.208
but... I can't eat any more.

13:35.291 --> 13:36.458
I'm sorry.

13:37.333 --> 13:39.500
You have to eat cake at parties.

13:39.583 --> 13:43.041
Especially your own party.
Isn't that the rule?

13:43.125 --> 13:45.458
I don't know what's wrong with me.

13:45.541 --> 13:48.208
I just don't feel right.

13:48.291 --> 13:50.833
But... leaf cake is your favorite.

13:50.916 --> 13:53.750
- Me too. Mmm.
- Buzz!

13:55.208 --> 13:58.125
Sorry. Very sorry.

13:58.208 --> 14:02.333
Maybe it's 'cause you're getting older
and bigger.

14:02.416 --> 14:06.875
Sometimes growing bigger
can make you feel a little unwell.

14:06.958 --> 14:09.125
And sometimes...

14:09.208 --> 14:12.375
You know, you just keep on feeling fine.

14:14.708 --> 14:16.833
I made you a photo album

14:16.916 --> 14:20.166
of some of the best things
we have all done together.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.875
Thank you very much, Kumi.

14:24.583 --> 14:27.083
Heh. That was your birthday
two years ago.

14:27.166 --> 14:28.666
Let's play limbo.

14:44.666 --> 14:45.916
Whoa!

14:51.666 --> 14:55.333
I am the bestest at limbo!

14:55.416 --> 14:57.625
You're good at limbo too, Katter.

14:57.708 --> 15:01.916
Of course, being tall places me
at a significant disadvantage.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.166
Significant disadvantage.

15:04.250 --> 15:05.666
You're getting taller, Katter.

15:05.750 --> 15:08.166
Limbo gets harder
the taller and bigger you are.

15:08.250 --> 15:10.125
Am I getting taller?

15:10.208 --> 15:11.500
And bigger?

15:11.583 --> 15:14.000
-Yeah, of course.
-The taller-est!

15:14.083 --> 15:15.750
That was a good memory.

15:15.833 --> 15:18.166
There are more photos to look at.

15:18.250 --> 15:19.750
More memories to remember.

15:19.833 --> 15:21.916
Oh, oh! Let's look at another photo.

15:26.208 --> 15:28.500
What--? What's that?

15:29.208 --> 15:32.250
Hmm. Sounds like, uh...

15:32.333 --> 15:35.750
-Swelly Belly.
-Oh, no, Swelly Belly.

15:35.833 --> 15:37.541
Ouchie.

15:37.625 --> 15:39.333
I do feel sick.

15:39.416 --> 15:41.041
I'm going to have to go.

15:41.125 --> 15:42.833
-Leave?
-Your own party?

15:43.458 --> 15:45.583
I think I need to sleep.

16:07.833 --> 16:09.625
-Buzz!
-Hm?

16:11.750 --> 16:13.291
Sorry.

16:13.791 --> 16:15.125
They're irresistible.

16:15.208 --> 16:17.541
We need to get everyone back together.

16:19.541 --> 16:21.583
-What is it?
-Whoa!

16:24.083 --> 16:26.791
Sorry, that's just inertia.

16:27.333 --> 16:30.666
We can't let Katter not have a party
on her birthday.

16:30.750 --> 16:33.916
We have to take the party to her,
and bring your own costume, too.

16:34.541 --> 16:37.583
This was my backup costume
as Prince Slugly.

16:38.958 --> 16:40.666
Will it do?

16:40.750 --> 16:42.666
Jay, you and Buzz go that way.

16:42.750 --> 16:45.208
Crick and Walter, you go that way.

16:45.291 --> 16:47.708
We need to give her
the best birthday memory ever.

16:47.791 --> 16:49.208

Katter!

18:26.708 --> 18:28.916
- Hey, Katter!
- Katter!

18:30.708 --> 18:31.583
Huh?

18:33.458 --> 18:38.083
-Shh. She's asleep.
-You can't sleep on your birthday.

18:40.375 --> 18:42.916
Katter? Katter?

18:43.000 --> 18:46.541
Wake up. It's your birthday.

18:48.500 --> 18:50.583
I guess we'd better not wake her.

18:50.666 --> 18:52.875
This birthday isn't awesome.

18:52.958 --> 18:55.125
Not awesome at all.

19:02.916 --> 19:04.541
Hmm.

19:14.291 --> 19:16.125
Two days.

19:16.208 --> 19:20.625
To be precise,
by my calculations, it's been, uh...

19:20.708 --> 19:21.750
Two days.

19:21.833 --> 19:23.166
Well, approximately.

19:23.250 --> 19:25.000
Who sleeps that long?

19:25.083 --> 19:28.041
Katter! Katter!

19:28.625 --> 19:30.916
I mean, I love my beauty sleep too,

19:31.000 --> 19:32.750
but, uh, seriously.

19:39.666 --> 19:42.500
She's very a-sleepy.

19:49.500 --> 19:55.000
This is the longer-est
and the sleepiest birthday party ever.

19:56.416 --> 19:57.916
What are you taking a photo of?

19:58.000 --> 20:01.041
Katter sleeping,
for the photo album.

20:04.916 --> 20:06.708
What's happening?

20:12.041 --> 20:14.583
What happened to me?

20:14.666 --> 20:16.583
Oh, my.

20:17.583 --> 20:18.541
Look.

20:21.166 --> 20:23.625
Belly- lisimo!
