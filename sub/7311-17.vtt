WEBVTT

01:36.453 --> 01:37.453
Where is McGee?

01:37.962 --> 01:38.962
I don't know.

01:39.703 --> 01:42.177
He's been acting distracted lately.
Gibbs is on his case.

01:42.237 --> 01:43.356
I have noticed.

01:44.394 --> 01:45.394
So...

01:45.995 --> 01:48.490
did you know
Special Agent Patterson?

01:50.032 --> 01:51.198
Not really.

01:51.258 --> 01:55.049
Met him in a crime scene training
class at FLETC. Seemed like a nice guy.

01:56.060 --> 01:57.291
Give McGee a call.

01:57.999 --> 01:59.191
Tell him we're waiting.

01:59.633 --> 02:00.971
I have a message.

02:01.470 --> 02:04.475
Good afternoon, I'm calling from
Hubbard & Hubbard, solicitor's office...

02:04.555 --> 02:06.309
Sorry. There was
an accident on MacArthur.

02:06.579 --> 02:07.579
Let's go.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.020
That was strange.

02:09.695 --> 02:11.941
A law firm in London
wants me to call.

02:12.446 --> 02:14.610
- Says it's important.
- What could they want?

02:14.838 --> 02:16.869
I don't know.
Maybe it's about my Uncle Clive.

02:16.929 --> 02:18.931
Remember that funeral
I went to last month?

02:19.154 --> 02:20.808
Your uncle really died?

02:21.084 --> 02:23.264
I thought you were making that up
to get some time off.

02:25.753 --> 02:27.123
Who do you think I am?

02:28.216 --> 02:30.443
He was Agent Afloat
on the George Washington.

02:31.504 --> 02:33.045
It returned to Norfolk two days ago.

02:33.325 --> 02:34.839
You notified Director Vance?

02:34.920 --> 02:35.920
Yeah.

02:36.089 --> 02:38.676
It's way after midnight in Singapore.
I send up an e-mail.

02:52.895 --> 02:55.025
Sorry, boss. Got hung up in traffic.

03:04.151 --> 03:07.461
911 came from the pastry chef
at the restaurant on the corner.

03:07.521 --> 03:10.762
He was in the kitchen when he heard
the screech of tires. Ran out.

03:11.038 --> 03:13.723
Caught sight of
a dark-colored SUV racing away.

03:14.023 --> 03:16.345
He did not here any shots. Silencer?

03:16.764 --> 03:19.175
Or a small-caliber weapon
that doesn't make much noise.

03:19.515 --> 03:21.177
Ducky said
the entry wounds were small.

03:21.415 --> 03:24.388
Yeah. One shot was behind the ear,
close-range.

03:25.347 --> 03:26.348
Professional hit.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.187
You might want to take
a look at this.

03:39.319 --> 03:40.925
DiNozzo, bring him in.

03:41.231 --> 03:42.778
Homeland Security. Got it.

03:45.087 --> 03:47.244
Tony, why'd you cover for me?

03:47.649 --> 03:48.649
Did I?

03:49.335 --> 03:51.930
This is Anthony DiNozzo, NCIS.
Please call me back...

03:52.559 --> 03:54.895
Patterson never got a shot off.
The mag's full.

03:55.649 --> 03:57.630
Boss, I reached his office.

03:57.962 --> 03:59.480
Voice mail. Left a message.

04:00.775 --> 04:03.343
DiNozzo,
cell phone on the back of the card.

04:05.964 --> 04:06.964
Good eye.

04:08.047 --> 04:09.824
I don't know
how I could have missed that.

04:11.056 --> 04:14.439
Bartholomew Lemming,
this is Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.

04:14.858 --> 04:17.608
Special Agent Gibbs, I got a woman
who insists on talking to you.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.152
Claims she's with NCIS.
Real weirdo.

04:20.469 --> 04:22.822
Wearing a Dracula cape
and dog collar.

04:23.142 --> 04:24.406
Like she'd be with you.

04:25.246 --> 04:26.246
She is.

04:26.714 --> 04:27.745
You serious?

04:28.152 --> 04:29.787
Oh, yeah. Let her in.

04:31.762 --> 04:33.312
Sorry about that. Go ahead.

04:35.748 --> 04:37.044
What are you doing here?

04:37.651 --> 04:38.651
Is that him?

04:39.084 --> 04:40.839
Is that Jack Patterson?

04:40.920 --> 04:42.132
What are you doing here?

04:42.721 --> 04:44.020
This is terrible.

04:45.214 --> 04:47.096
- Abby...
- This is all my fault.

04:48.967 --> 04:50.642
Gibbs, he was coming to see me.

04:59.328 --> 05:02.409
Agent Jack Patterson.
It's not what I thought he'd look like.

05:02.597 --> 05:03.619
Said you knew him.

05:04.204 --> 05:07.331
We had a very special
phone relationship.

05:07.531 --> 05:11.273
He would mail me forensic evidence,
I'd e-mail him back results.

05:11.954 --> 05:13.670
He'd call me, I'd call him.

05:13.933 --> 05:15.689
He never forgot my birthday...

05:16.554 --> 05:17.995
like you did last year.

05:18.506 --> 05:21.158
I don't know. It's his voice.
He sounded...

05:22.297 --> 05:23.297
shorter,

05:23.366 --> 05:25.645
blonder, with a mustache.

05:27.269 --> 05:29.238
You got all that
from his voice, Abs?

05:30.954 --> 05:33.037
You sounded different
when you had a mustache.

05:38.642 --> 05:40.531
Well, why was he coming to see you?

05:40.770 --> 05:42.525
He said he wanted
to show me something.

05:44.019 --> 05:45.019
What?

05:46.330 --> 05:47.330
I don't know.

05:48.645 --> 05:50.319
He wanted to meet up last night.

05:51.144 --> 05:52.756
And I... I put him off.

05:53.124 --> 05:54.962
I told him to come this morning.

05:56.833 --> 05:57.833
Gibbs, if...

05:58.020 --> 06:01.724
if I had just met up with him last
night, he'd probably be alive right now.

06:09.013 --> 06:11.777
Well, it's a little after 10:00
in the morning here.

06:12.147 --> 06:14.987
I can be reached on my cell at any time.
You did write that number down?

06:15.783 --> 06:17.276
Good. Tell Mr. Hubbard

06:17.643 --> 06:19.528
that I anxiously await his call,

06:19.608 --> 06:21.810
and you have yourself
a very nice day

06:21.870 --> 06:24.378
or night,
or whatever time it is there.

06:24.988 --> 06:25.988
Okay,

06:26.028 --> 06:27.028
cheerio.

06:30.221 --> 06:31.790
I suppose that was for my benefit.

06:32.199 --> 06:33.270
Okay, I'll bite.

06:33.961 --> 06:35.210
Are you in the will?

06:39.286 --> 06:40.286
McProbie,

06:40.722 --> 06:42.713
we can only assume, right?

06:44.960 --> 06:46.312
That was his secretary.

06:46.372 --> 06:47.598
Mr. Hubbard, my...

06:47.812 --> 06:49.849
great-uncle's solicitor
wasn't available, but...

06:50.406 --> 06:52.424
she did confirm that...

06:52.484 --> 06:54.533
he represents Uncle Clive's estate.

06:56.024 --> 06:57.148
Clive DiNozzo.

06:58.334 --> 07:00.569
Clive Paddington.
It's my mother's side.

07:02.206 --> 07:04.603
- We talking big money?
- Huge money!

07:06.686 --> 07:08.185
I mean, Jed Clampett money.

07:08.245 --> 07:09.813
I'm talking Texas gold.

07:10.477 --> 07:12.372
It's actually North Sea oil money.

07:13.382 --> 07:15.292
I take it you were close
to the old gent.

07:15.622 --> 07:17.711
I spent my 17th summer in Blighty.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.379
Uncle Clive was my mentor.

07:19.684 --> 07:21.806
Kind of like Al Pacino
and Chris O'Donnell

07:21.866 --> 07:23.221
in Scent of a Woman.

07:25.465 --> 07:27.429
Guessing the opposite sex
was involved.

07:27.510 --> 07:29.348
He could sniff out
a gorgeous woman and

07:29.428 --> 07:31.311
close the deal faster
than anyone I ever met.

07:32.095 --> 07:34.019
I'm more concerned
about closing that case.

07:34.290 --> 07:35.479
I'm working on it, boss.

07:39.415 --> 07:40.415
Right...

07:41.274 --> 07:43.361
The George Washington returned
from a six-month

07:43.421 --> 07:45.446
deployment to South
and Central America.

07:45.527 --> 07:48.947
Special Agent Patterson was
still living on board in Norfolk.

07:49.032 --> 07:52.162
Was looking for an apartment. No one
knew he left the ship and was in D.C.

07:52.242 --> 07:55.082
Ten years in the Navy,
joined NCIS in '98.

07:55.162 --> 07:57.861
He had a setback in 2003.

07:58.165 --> 08:00.365
Spent some time on the beach
for use of excessive force.

08:00.396 --> 08:02.074
Never married.
Only immediate family:

08:02.134 --> 08:04.591
A mother and a sister living
in Wheeling, West Virginia.

08:04.884 --> 08:06.093
Special Agent Gibbs,

08:06.417 --> 08:08.287
Bartholomew Lemming,
Homeland Security.

08:08.828 --> 08:10.097
Call me Bart, Agent Gibbs.

08:12.839 --> 08:14.359
We're in the conference room.

08:20.761 --> 08:22.276
My life is about to change.

08:22.582 --> 08:25.115
Thinks he's about
to inherit a fortune.

08:31.137 --> 08:32.136
Oh! Yeah.

08:32.820 --> 08:33.820
Oh. Yeah.

08:34.586 --> 08:36.485
Okay, as soon as I can. Sorry.

08:37.268 --> 08:40.294
Blockbuster. Rosemary's Baby,
it's overdue.

08:42.940 --> 08:44.172
I met Jack Patterson

08:44.381 --> 08:46.383
shortly after I joined
Homeland Security.

08:46.832 --> 08:49.511
I was assigned to Customs
Border Protection Division.

08:49.832 --> 08:53.487
He was working out of the NCIS
Resident Agency in Yuma, Arizona, so

08:54.136 --> 08:57.194
we coordinated on incursions
and smuggling cases.

08:57.379 --> 09:00.596
- The last time you heard from him?
- He left me a message last night.

09:01.421 --> 09:04.069
I was gonna call him
when I got to the office this morning.

09:04.318 --> 09:07.174
Said he was working a case and he found
something he wanted to show me.

09:07.662 --> 09:08.662
Yeah.

09:08.836 --> 09:10.282
What did he want to show you?

09:11.937 --> 09:13.118
What's he working on?

09:14.099 --> 09:15.099
I don't know.

09:16.339 --> 09:17.998
Jack and I were friendly in Yuma.

09:18.619 --> 09:21.001
You know how it goes.
We lost contact with one another.

09:22.200 --> 09:23.200
How did he die?

09:23.995 --> 09:24.995
Shot.

09:25.325 --> 09:26.673
Think he was on his way here.

09:27.159 --> 09:29.843
And he had my business card
in his hand. Why?

09:31.702 --> 09:32.702
You tell me.

09:34.953 --> 09:36.365
We had some good times.

09:37.137 --> 09:39.189
Jack could put them down.
He knew how to party.

09:39.249 --> 09:41.181
We were single then.

09:41.452 --> 09:43.148
Took the plunge last year.

09:47.209 --> 09:48.557
What can I do to help?

09:49.999 --> 09:51.081
I don't know yet.

09:51.670 --> 09:53.894
You have my cell number.
That's the best way to reach me.

09:53.918 --> 09:55.732
I'm in the field this week.

09:55.975 --> 09:59.039
Well, joint Threat Assessment
Task Force with the FBI.

10:01.189 --> 10:02.668
I wish you luck with that.

10:29.910 --> 10:31.279
You know, we always said that,

10:32.570 --> 10:34.063
we would meet someday.

10:34.257 --> 10:36.458
This isn't exactly what I expected.

10:38.187 --> 10:39.564
God, this is awkward.

10:42.079 --> 10:45.369
When you called me last night,
you sounded...

10:45.880 --> 10:47.413
you know, excited.

10:47.610 --> 10:49.120
Said you had to see me.

10:50.912 --> 10:52.720
I thought you meant a date.

10:55.082 --> 10:56.702
I mean, did you want to go out

10:57.200 --> 10:58.772
or was it something else?

10:59.725 --> 11:01.873
Was I just jumping
to conclusions? I...

11:03.144 --> 11:05.791
God, I didn't know
what to say to Gibbs.

11:08.996 --> 11:10.647
Oh, no, are you behind me, Gibbs?

11:12.708 --> 11:14.354
You flatter me, Abby.

11:17.014 --> 11:20.787
There was just... there was something
I needed to ask Special Agent Patterson.

11:22.129 --> 11:23.271
What?

11:23.833 --> 11:25.756
You talk to dead people
all the time.

11:25.992 --> 11:27.328
Well, I have my reasons.

11:28.394 --> 11:30.630
Their bodies tell me a great deal.

11:31.429 --> 11:33.067
It helps to reciprocate.

11:35.084 --> 11:36.614
But we have work to do.

11:47.417 --> 11:48.520
I need the slugs.

11:49.016 --> 11:50.208
You'll get them...

11:51.958 --> 11:53.153
in due time.

11:56.138 --> 11:59.151
Patterson was supposed to be finishing
up paperwork on the deployment.

11:59.211 --> 12:01.142
I have no idea
why he was in Washington.

12:01.459 --> 12:02.972
He's NCIS, don't you know?

12:03.156 --> 12:05.527
Anything unusual happen
during the deployment?

12:05.587 --> 12:07.436
Well, 6,500 men and women,

12:07.496 --> 12:10.004
six months, seven tropical ports,
the usual.

12:10.271 --> 12:12.388
Alcohol, fighting, petty thefts.

12:12.587 --> 12:15.603
All in Patterson's daily activity log...
nothing major.

12:16.179 --> 12:18.345
- Excuse me, Commander?
- Yes?

12:18.425 --> 12:20.138
Could you identify these photos?

12:20.335 --> 12:23.183
It's the last file Patterson
opened yesterday afternoon.

12:23.423 --> 12:25.556
These images were downloaded
from a digital camera.

12:26.224 --> 12:28.491
9-35-6-A.

12:28.916 --> 12:31.752
That would be a forward
port-side storage area.

12:32.492 --> 12:34.719
I spent four glorious months
aboard the Seahawk.

12:35.034 --> 12:37.037
It was a rewarding experience.

12:37.581 --> 12:39.324
This part of an investigation,
Commander?

12:40.424 --> 12:43.391
It's a big ship,
on a cruise to South America.

12:43.732 --> 12:47.217
A misguided sailor might think
he'll be able to smuggle drugs aboard.

12:48.800 --> 12:50.335
I'm not getting a signal down here.

12:50.896 --> 12:52.379
You expecting a call, DiNozzo?

12:52.599 --> 12:53.839
They'll leave a message.

12:53.920 --> 12:56.049
Patterson
and I worked well together.

12:56.244 --> 12:59.035
He understood
the demands on the X.O.

12:59.524 --> 13:01.725
Usually didn't come to me
until he had something.

13:11.581 --> 13:14.150
Well, if you were thinking of smuggling
something, this'd be

13:14.231 --> 13:15.694
the perfect hiding place.

13:16.622 --> 13:17.716
Check it out.

13:20.245 --> 13:22.456
Boss, it's, it's pretty late.

13:22.516 --> 13:25.328
This could take hours, and then it's
a long drive back to Washington.

13:25.408 --> 13:28.582
Most of the crew's on leave.
You'll find a place to bunk.

13:29.829 --> 13:30.872
Perfect.

13:32.220 --> 13:33.253
22-caliber.

13:33.740 --> 13:35.255
This one's in pristine shape.

13:36.624 --> 13:37.716
I like pristine.

13:40.535 --> 13:41.535
Hey, Roy.

13:42.225 --> 13:43.309
U.S. mail.

13:44.033 --> 13:45.348
You mean overnight carrier.

13:45.935 --> 13:49.096
No, no, U.S. mail.
Someone dropped this in the mailbox.

13:49.279 --> 13:50.279
No postage.

13:50.432 --> 13:53.231
'Cause it was addressed to NCIS,
the postal inspector gave us a call.

13:54.163 --> 13:56.484
It's addressed to me?
Well, you could say that.

13:57.543 --> 13:59.195
It's a credit card receipt.

14:03.438 --> 14:04.614
It's Jack Patterson.

14:04.674 --> 14:07.877
Did the... postal inspector say
where it was mailed from?

14:09.200 --> 14:10.732
400 block of K Street.

14:13.927 --> 14:15.420
That's where Patterson was killed.

14:15.944 --> 14:16.944
So...

14:17.189 --> 14:20.717
he knew he was in jeopardy, and
his last desperate act was to mail this?

14:22.312 --> 14:24.742
He wanted this to get to me
even he didn't.

14:33.580 --> 14:35.148
He died getting me this?

14:48.715 --> 14:50.672
There has to be a reason
he sent it to you.

14:51.340 --> 14:52.247
I don't know.

14:52.327 --> 14:55.317
I mean, maybe he guessed
the little girl looked like me, or...

14:55.377 --> 14:56.710
No, that's... stupid.

14:56.941 --> 14:57.941
I don't know.

14:58.878 --> 15:00.254
You ever talk about art?

15:01.439 --> 15:04.510
When you weren't talking about forensic
evidence, what'd you talk about?

15:04.705 --> 15:06.986
Well, that's personal.
I feel like you're interrogating me.

15:07.010 --> 15:08.010
I am.

15:11.335 --> 15:14.019
Okay, she's reading a book.
The book got a title?

15:20.064 --> 15:22.043
Abby, Patterson died
getting this to you.

15:22.541 --> 15:23.541
I know.

15:24.067 --> 15:25.947
This is totally weirding me out.

15:26.029 --> 15:27.950
All right,
you said you had a match on the slug.

15:28.235 --> 15:29.243
Yeah.

15:31.241 --> 15:32.241
Okay.

15:32.379 --> 15:35.790
The one on the left is one
that Ducky took from Patterson.

15:36.006 --> 15:37.718
I ran it through the NIBIN database.

15:38.166 --> 15:40.421
It's an exact match
to the one on the right,

15:40.664 --> 15:42.065
which was used...

15:42.786 --> 15:46.677
in the unsolved murder of a businessman
in Scottsdale, Arizona, two years ago.

16:13.100 --> 16:14.743
What are you doing in there?

16:14.803 --> 16:15.803
Our jobs.

16:16.388 --> 16:17.896
I'm looking for contraband.

16:19.266 --> 16:20.361
I found this.

16:21.060 --> 16:22.403
You are looking good.

16:23.392 --> 16:25.062
- What have we here?
- We?

16:25.956 --> 16:28.461
Where were you, when I'm down there
banging my head, huh?

16:28.521 --> 16:29.755
Skinning my knees?

16:29.815 --> 16:32.598
I was up on the flight deck,
trying to get a cell signal.

16:33.719 --> 16:36.268
I've been playing phone tag
with Uncle Clive's solicitor.

16:36.517 --> 16:38.957
Screw your Uncle Clive.
You haven't done anything all morning.

16:41.704 --> 16:43.316
What's with you, McCranky?

16:43.768 --> 16:44.943
You need to chillax.

16:45.132 --> 16:46.474
You want me to chillax?

16:46.534 --> 16:47.766
You want me to chillax?

16:47.826 --> 16:50.908
I will chillax when you tell me
that you have done something!

16:51.321 --> 16:52.701
I have done something.

16:54.519 --> 16:58.318
I went over Special Agent Patterson's
e-mails and daily activity log.

16:58.589 --> 17:01.168
Four days ago, he did
a background check on a...

17:01.423 --> 17:03.026
Seaman Richard Zell.

17:03.250 --> 17:05.829
He's had him under surveillance
since Panama. Zell...

17:06.334 --> 17:08.934
is one of only three people
with the access code to...

17:09.162 --> 17:10.301
this storage bay.

17:11.023 --> 17:12.262
Where's Seaman Zell now?

17:13.002 --> 17:15.400
According to the ship's duty
roster log,

17:16.199 --> 17:18.185
he's due back on board in an hour.

17:22.290 --> 17:24.942
- You make anything of it?
- Yeah. I'm aware of the artist.

17:25.214 --> 17:26.276
Dina Risi.

17:26.400 --> 17:27.944
I admired her work in Yuma.

17:28.164 --> 17:30.314
I should've bought it then.
I can't afford it now.

17:30.786 --> 17:32.786
Any idea why Patterson
would've sent it to our lab?

17:33.040 --> 17:35.369
I've been trying to make
a connection between the painting

17:35.450 --> 17:36.737
and Jack, but I can't.

17:36.797 --> 17:38.905
That was a Scottsdale
homicide detective...

17:38.965 --> 17:40.715
it made his day
when I told him the weapon

17:40.775 --> 17:44.169
that killed Special Agent Patterson was
the same one that was used in the murder

17:44.250 --> 17:46.713
of a local businessman
by the name of...

17:47.214 --> 17:48.423
Hamilton Cooper.

17:49.015 --> 17:51.782
They have not had any movement
on the case in the past two years.

17:51.963 --> 17:53.886
He is e-mailing me their case file.

17:53.967 --> 17:56.048
You think his death had anything
to do with the time

17:56.108 --> 17:57.699
he and I were stationed in Yuma?

17:58.465 --> 17:59.465
Do you?

18:00.977 --> 18:03.371
Well, we did some joint operations.
I'll make some phone calls,

18:03.395 --> 18:05.357
go back through the files,
see what I can dig up.

18:08.637 --> 18:11.781
Uncle Clive's primary residence
is this manor house

18:11.841 --> 18:14.978
that's just outside
of Henley on Thames.

18:15.038 --> 18:16.825
You have to come and visit sometime.

18:17.192 --> 18:20.382
In the summer, they have these...
annual regattas.

18:20.657 --> 18:22.083
It's absolutely smashing.

18:22.143 --> 18:23.143
Tony, shut up.

18:24.580 --> 18:27.450
"What I wouldn't give
for a sock full of horse manure."

18:27.510 --> 18:28.925
La-di-da!

18:28.985 --> 18:31.425
Look at you,
fancy-pants-movie-reference.

18:31.506 --> 18:33.509
Annie Hall, 1977.

18:33.706 --> 18:35.225
Really Woody Allen's best.

18:35.285 --> 18:37.251
Did I tell you about Clive's...

18:37.618 --> 18:39.379
muse in London? Really?

18:39.439 --> 18:41.692
Do you have any idea
how insufferable you are?

18:42.724 --> 18:43.937
What are you doing?

18:44.143 --> 18:46.095
You're dripping paint
all over the place.

18:47.749 --> 18:50.459
Look, you see what you're doing there?
Look at what I'm doing, okay?

18:50.519 --> 18:51.904
Watch. You do...

18:52.205 --> 18:53.816
even strokes.

18:54.215 --> 18:56.930
You see that?
Nice, even strokes.

18:59.104 --> 19:01.246
We're pretend painting, McGoo.

19:02.911 --> 19:04.223
Keep that away from me.

19:34.184 --> 19:35.322
NCIS.

19:35.930 --> 19:38.275
Put your hands behind your head,
spread your legs.

19:44.762 --> 19:45.823
God!

19:46.806 --> 19:48.126
I don't need this crap!

19:49.177 --> 19:50.867
I'm about to be a very wealthy man.

19:52.961 --> 19:54.751
I fumed it with cyanoacrylate.

19:54.811 --> 19:56.431
There's dozens of prints.

19:56.525 --> 19:59.012
So far I've been able to I.D. two:

19:59.093 --> 20:02.057
Special Agent Patterson
and Roy from our mail room.

20:02.138 --> 20:05.018
So many prints, so little time.
But...

20:05.098 --> 20:06.520
I tried something else.

20:06.857 --> 20:09.898
How long do you think it takes
ballpoint pen ink to dry?

20:09.958 --> 20:11.233
Like, really, really dry.

20:12.354 --> 20:13.459
Four to five days.

20:14.232 --> 20:16.991
I removed the clear plastic window
from the carton,

20:17.051 --> 20:18.715
and I coated
the inside with a solvent,

20:18.775 --> 20:22.035
lifting the ink residue left
by the original sender's mailing label.

20:22.383 --> 20:25.103
I heat-transferred it
to a clean piece of paper,

20:25.981 --> 20:27.383
then I scanned it...

20:29.623 --> 20:31.291
What's it say?
I can't make it out.

20:31.351 --> 20:32.779
I'm not done yet, Gibbs.

20:32.839 --> 20:34.798
And I ran it through
an enhancement program.

20:37.203 --> 20:40.177
The package was sent
to Patterson from the artist,

20:40.237 --> 20:42.097
Dina Risi.
And there's her phone number.

20:43.187 --> 20:44.467
Give yourself an atta-girl.

20:44.527 --> 20:45.885
- Atta-girl.
- Atta-girl.

20:46.264 --> 20:47.850
You get anywhere with the painting?

20:49.398 --> 20:51.064
Never enough for you, Gibbs, is it?

20:51.756 --> 20:54.076
Went right to voice mail...
she's got her phone turned off.

21:04.502 --> 21:06.231
You know we've got you for drugs...

21:07.778 --> 21:09.939
and assaulting a Federal Officer.

21:11.408 --> 21:13.046
So why don't you tell me...

21:13.557 --> 21:16.544
what was going down
between you and Agent Patterson.

21:19.468 --> 21:20.593
Yeah, I punched him.

21:20.955 --> 21:21.955
Yeah.

21:22.217 --> 21:23.631
Yeah, the coke is mine.

21:24.342 --> 21:26.791
But I told you, it's a big ship,

21:27.171 --> 21:28.477
I didn't know Patterson.

21:29.162 --> 21:30.401
Well, he knew you.

21:31.028 --> 21:33.523
Had you under surveillance
since the ship left Panama.

21:33.740 --> 21:35.906
He may have killed
Special Agent Patterson, but.

21:35.966 --> 21:38.956
Seaman Zell could not have
killed the Arizona businessman.

21:39.016 --> 21:41.159
According to his service records,

21:41.404 --> 21:42.739
he was aboard a frigate

21:42.799 --> 21:45.096
on his way to the Persian Gulf
at the time of the murder.

21:45.199 --> 21:46.578
Tell me why you didn't.

21:47.233 --> 21:49.567
I was just trying
to make a couple bucks.

21:50.155 --> 21:51.833
Could you live on an E-3 salary?

21:52.147 --> 21:54.434
- What did you pay for the coke?
- $2,000.

21:54.494 --> 21:56.409
I'm going home to Brooklyn
on leave next week.

21:56.469 --> 21:57.973
On the street, I can get 20.

22:00.308 --> 22:02.413
Well, you'll be lucky
if you get 25...

22:02.473 --> 22:04.179
years for murder.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.717
His alibi for yesterday morning
checks out.

22:11.385 --> 22:13.105
Patterson was shot at 5:40 A.M.

22:13.442 --> 22:15.232
30 minutes later, Seaman Zell

22:15.470 --> 22:18.667
was with drawing $40
from an ATM on the base at Norfolk.

22:18.876 --> 22:20.070
That's 200 miles away.

22:20.658 --> 22:22.535
Even you couldn't drive
that fast, boss.

22:32.514 --> 22:34.165
Based on the amount
of drugs involved,

22:34.225 --> 22:36.667
we're pretty sure
that Seaman Zell was working alone.

22:36.876 --> 22:39.476
So I don't have a serious smuggling
problem aboard the Washington.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.492
A new NCIS Agent will be assigned
this week. He'll follow up.

22:43.573 --> 22:44.965
What's to follow up?

22:45.423 --> 22:47.663
I thought you said Seaman Zell
didn't have any connection

22:47.710 --> 22:49.498
to Special Agent Patterson's death.

22:50.205 --> 22:52.000
It's an ongoing investigation.

22:52.877 --> 22:54.685
We're returning him to your command.

22:56.122 --> 22:58.287
Suggest you put him in
pre-trial confinement.

23:02.258 --> 23:04.805
He say anything?
Feel like the guy's got an agenda?

23:04.886 --> 23:07.375
- What do we got?
- McGee, tell him about the e-mail.

23:07.435 --> 23:09.848
Doesn't sound like Patterson
shared Commander Weidman's feelings

23:09.872 --> 23:11.562
about them working well together.

23:12.016 --> 23:14.731
Patterson told the captain in an e-mail
that he felt Weidman

23:14.812 --> 23:16.817
was obstructing
some of his investigations.

23:16.898 --> 23:19.861
- Got a call into the captain.
- Gibbs, Dina Risi, the artist,

23:19.942 --> 23:22.822
she's starting to be recognized
outside Arizona.

23:22.903 --> 23:25.386
Had a showing
in San Francisco in December.

23:25.446 --> 23:27.244
She specializes in landscape.

23:27.324 --> 23:28.468
She grew up in Italy,

23:28.528 --> 23:31.231
studied art in Milan,
moved to Arizona about ten years ago.

23:31.291 --> 23:34.376
Dina Risi's always been
very outspoken on ecological issues.

23:34.615 --> 23:36.336
I did talk to the local sheriff...

23:36.672 --> 23:38.676
guy by the name of Clay Boyd.

23:38.915 --> 23:41.992
And he said that he was looking for her,
but she,

23:42.069 --> 23:43.564
well, she just disappeared.

23:44.076 --> 23:46.279
- Disappeared?
- Disappeared.

23:46.411 --> 23:48.437
Like she just fell off
the face of the earth.

23:48.574 --> 23:51.132
He talks just like that.
That's how he talks.

23:51.446 --> 23:53.825
I won't though.
Says that she has a remote,

23:53.902 --> 23:56.980
mountain retreat where likes to go and
paint, but he doesn't know where it is.

23:57.004 --> 23:59.087
- Find it, McGee.
- Think I did, boss.

23:59.335 --> 24:02.609
I only used Risi paintings that have
distinctive geographical landmarks.

24:02.686 --> 24:04.760
Compared them
to Google Earth satellite images.

24:04.947 --> 24:07.305
These locations correspond
to backgrounds in her paintings.

24:07.427 --> 24:09.682
They're all within a four-mile
radius of Mount Pinos.

24:09.826 --> 24:11.717
Searched the area,
only found one structure.

24:12.328 --> 24:13.814
This was taken six months ago.

24:13.985 --> 24:15.605
Good. See if she's there.

24:16.681 --> 24:17.993
Piece of cake, Probie.

24:20.631 --> 24:23.922
A Ferrari. 599 GTB.

24:24.710 --> 24:26.948
You are counting
your eggs before they are laid.

24:28.599 --> 24:29.950
Operative word is "laid".

24:35.990 --> 24:38.357
- Wouldn't drink that.
- Sure I've had worse.

24:40.451 --> 24:43.075
- What do you have?
- I know who's at the center of this.

24:43.513 --> 24:44.863
Dina Risi, the artist.

24:45.006 --> 24:47.953
Get this: I talked to a bartender
at a place Jack and I used to hang.

24:48.472 --> 24:51.183
After I left Arizona,
Jack used to come in with her.

24:51.471 --> 24:53.766
Bartender hinted they were
a lot more than just friends.

24:53.890 --> 24:56.640
Might explain why Dina Risi
sent Patterson the painting.

24:56.788 --> 24:57.918
You talk to her yet?

24:58.126 --> 25:00.634
No. She went into hiding.
We may have a location though.

25:01.450 --> 25:04.291
- Mount Pinos.
- That's the badlands.

25:04.990 --> 25:06.530
Good luck finding her up there.

25:12.918 --> 25:14.559
I'm e-mailing the lawyer in London.

25:14.660 --> 25:16.562
All right?
The suspense is killing me.

25:16.622 --> 25:17.915
I did not ask.

25:18.552 --> 25:20.479
I have the Scottsdale Police report

25:20.539 --> 25:22.766
on the murder of Hamilton Cooper,
the local businessman.

25:22.826 --> 25:24.382
- Anything?
- Yes.

25:25.598 --> 25:27.934
He was worth $20 million.

25:28.133 --> 25:31.095
Investigators suspected
his wife hired a hit man.

25:31.303 --> 25:33.037
She was conveniently out of town.

25:33.099 --> 25:35.494
Shooter used a .22,
multiple hits to the body.

25:35.667 --> 25:38.187
One to the head,
right behind the ear.

25:38.309 --> 25:39.474
Just like Patterson.

25:39.534 --> 25:41.875
Well, I guess that lets
Commander Weidman off the hook.

25:43.621 --> 25:45.665
Boss. Tasked an NSA satellite.

25:45.725 --> 25:47.809
I got an infrared image
of the cabin here.

25:51.621 --> 25:54.366
Heat signature from the fireplace.
Somebody's there.

25:54.912 --> 25:56.968
Ziva, you and McGee
work the case from here.

25:57.028 --> 25:58.548
DiNozzo, go home, pack.

25:58.773 --> 26:01.145
- Where am I going?
- We're going to Arizona.

26:01.415 --> 26:02.415
Okay.

26:03.596 --> 26:05.313
Arizona and I don't get along.

26:32.768 --> 26:34.774
- Sheriff Boyd?
- Yes, sir.

26:35.134 --> 26:36.678
Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.

26:39.039 --> 26:41.167
Hey. Special Agent DiNozzo.
How are you?

26:42.564 --> 26:43.895
Is that an Italian name?

26:44.832 --> 26:47.269
- What?
- Any word on Dina Risi?

26:47.551 --> 26:50.158
Nope. We tried all our sources.

26:50.278 --> 26:52.499
- No one seems to know where she went.
- You know her?

26:52.685 --> 26:55.014
Well, I met her.
She was chained to a tree.

26:55.202 --> 26:57.656
I was the one
with the bolt cutters and handcuffs.

26:58.829 --> 27:00.974
Let me show you
where we're aiming to go, Sheriff.

27:03.227 --> 27:06.358
We think she's in a small cabin in...
this area here.

27:07.205 --> 27:10.673
Are you expecting to go to a dance while
you're here in town, Agent DiNozzo?

27:15.794 --> 27:18.476
Why don't we take our four-wheeler.
You know, the rental.

27:18.536 --> 27:20.336
You can't get up there in a vehicle.

27:20.725 --> 27:22.311
Only way to get up there is horses.

27:23.903 --> 27:26.006
Why don't we just
requisition a helicopter?

27:27.071 --> 27:30.231
Or not. If the government spent
that kind of money every time

27:30.291 --> 27:33.069
they interviewed somebody,
government would go broke?

27:33.248 --> 27:34.618
The government is broke.

27:37.740 --> 27:40.248
That was security.
Bart Lemming is on his way up.

27:40.431 --> 27:41.852
Maybe he's got something for us.

27:45.819 --> 27:48.234
- That could be London.
- Answer it.

27:48.336 --> 27:50.011
What, and have
Tony harass me some more

27:50.071 --> 27:52.071
about my message-taking skills?
No, thank you.

27:52.895 --> 27:54.398
- I'll get it.
- Why?

27:54.570 --> 27:57.490
You're gonna tell them he's not here,
they're not gonna tell you anything.

27:59.892 --> 28:02.984
I think you are jealous
Tony's going to inherit money.

28:03.158 --> 28:05.121
No, I just think
that it could change him.

28:05.360 --> 28:07.378
Which in Tony's case
would be a good thing.

28:07.500 --> 28:09.449
Unless he becomes more...

28:09.585 --> 28:10.721
Tony-ish.

28:11.516 --> 28:12.645
I see your concern.

28:12.705 --> 28:15.761
But you did not change
when your books made you plush.

28:16.196 --> 28:17.196
Flush.

28:17.385 --> 28:19.595
Thanks, Ziva,
but it really wasn't that much.

28:20.026 --> 28:22.186
I bought my car,
bought some clothes.

28:22.349 --> 28:25.301
What was left over, I put
in a hedge fund which just crashed.

28:25.489 --> 28:26.489
Sorry.

28:26.518 --> 28:28.466
That is why you've been
so distracted lately.

28:28.813 --> 28:29.813
It shows?

28:32.909 --> 28:33.909
Easy.

28:39.006 --> 28:40.839
You ever saddled a horse, DiNozzio?

28:41.586 --> 28:43.438
Me? Saddle?

28:47.115 --> 28:49.413
- No, not really.
- You have ridden, ain't you?

28:49.557 --> 28:52.165
Sure. Oh, yeah.
Eighth birthday party.

28:52.911 --> 28:56.635
Pony rides and-and-and...
stuff like that.

28:57.190 --> 29:00.346
Well, this should be interesting.
Yeah. Give me that. Give me that.

29:00.469 --> 29:01.762
Here you go. I got it.

29:02.134 --> 29:04.350
It's a lot of leather.
Here we go.

29:05.197 --> 29:07.242
I'm looking
for Special Agent DiNozzo.

29:08.317 --> 29:10.024
He is away
from the office right now.

29:10.181 --> 29:13.521
He left me a message while I was
on vacation, said it was urgent.

29:13.916 --> 29:16.038
I returned his call,
but I haven't heard from him.

29:16.100 --> 29:17.100
And you are?

29:28.261 --> 29:29.766
Boss, we've got a problem.

29:30.166 --> 29:32.588
Bartholomew Lemming
from OHS is here.

29:32.893 --> 29:33.964
What's the problem?

29:34.358 --> 29:36.114
It's the real Bartholomew Lemming.

29:36.747 --> 29:39.803
The guy that we've been dealing with
is an impostor.

29:50.059 --> 29:51.949
He planted the business card
on his body,

29:52.066 --> 29:54.290
knowing whoever investigated
the murder would call.

29:54.350 --> 29:55.993
Yeah. Well, we did.

29:57.279 --> 29:59.093
And I briefed him
on the investigation.

29:59.159 --> 30:00.760
Well, the guy's good, boss.

30:01.082 --> 30:03.099
Probably knew Lemming
was on vacation.

30:03.372 --> 30:06.706
It's like Nicholson in Chinatown,
you know? He used a stolen business card

30:06.814 --> 30:09.534
to make everyone think he was
from the Department of Water and Power.

30:09.921 --> 30:12.217
- Maybe he left his print on the card.
- Abby's on it.

30:12.628 --> 30:15.429
McGee's running facial recognition
against NCIS security videos.

30:17.744 --> 30:18.744
Let's go!

30:22.837 --> 30:24.014
Excuse me, boss.

30:25.975 --> 30:27.733
Hey, no, no. Come on around here.

30:29.750 --> 30:32.658
- Is there a step ladder or anything?
- No. Go ahead, get up.

30:34.784 --> 30:36.731
- No, left foot.
- DiNozzo, come on!

30:36.791 --> 30:37.993
I'm on my way, boss.

30:39.859 --> 30:41.934
You don't want to get
on his bad side, do you?

30:41.994 --> 30:43.962
You're a good judge of character,
Sheriff.

30:44.343 --> 30:45.385
Oh, boy.

30:50.637 --> 30:51.637
There you go.

30:52.374 --> 30:53.527
He's going.

30:53.995 --> 30:54.995
He's going.

30:56.723 --> 30:58.363
No! Sheriff...

30:59.288 --> 31:00.979
I think he lost a contact.

31:02.219 --> 31:04.248
We X-rayed the painting
that Patterson sent me,

31:04.308 --> 31:06.589
but we couldn't get a clear image.
It was foggy.

31:07.009 --> 31:09.746
Did it four times,
thought it was the equipment.

31:09.806 --> 31:12.514
- I was about to call the technician...
- Then I got an idea.

31:19.981 --> 31:20.981
Radioactive.

31:21.906 --> 31:22.906
It's the paint.

31:23.300 --> 31:25.835
Dina Risi goes
to the extremes of mixing

31:25.895 --> 31:28.210
her paints and pigments
with indigenous substances,

31:28.332 --> 31:30.383
- much like the Mayans did.
- She used clay

31:30.443 --> 31:33.906
containing metallic elements
occurring in pitchblende.

31:34.046 --> 31:35.905
Also referred to as uraninite,

31:36.207 --> 31:39.584
which is processed
into purified uranium dioxide,

31:39.933 --> 31:40.933
UO2,

31:40.994 --> 31:42.704
also used in manufacturing...

31:43.027 --> 31:44.202
Nuclear weapons.

31:45.978 --> 31:47.251
Gibbs's satellite.

31:47.461 --> 31:50.139
I already tried calling him.
You're not gonna get a hold of him.

31:50.782 --> 31:51.824
It's ringing.

31:56.235 --> 31:57.979
It's not the painting,
it's the paint.

31:58.043 --> 32:01.145
The little girl, the dead steer,
the book, none of it means anything.

32:01.205 --> 32:03.787
I mean, well, I'm sure it meant
something to the artist, but...

32:04.771 --> 32:07.042
- Slow down. What are you trying to say?
- Patterson.

32:07.501 --> 32:09.042
The painting that he sent me.

32:09.199 --> 32:11.013
It wasn't about the image.

32:11.101 --> 32:12.994
The paint is radioactive.

32:13.218 --> 32:15.717
Uraninite,
used to make nuclear weapons.

32:16.008 --> 32:17.774
Dina Risi, she must have known.

32:17.834 --> 32:19.917
That's why she sent
the painting to Patterson.

32:20.316 --> 32:21.555
Transfer me to McGee.

32:25.252 --> 32:26.699
I haven't heard from you.

32:27.150 --> 32:30.662
We're still running facial recognition
on the fake Bartholomew Lemming.

32:30.847 --> 32:33.143
I am going to expand
the search to Interpol.

32:33.203 --> 32:36.797
But based on your suggestion,
we did lift a right forefinger

32:36.857 --> 32:40.117
and thumbprint from the carafe our
impostor used in the conference room.

32:40.177 --> 32:42.493
- Did you get a hit?
- No. He doesn't have a record.

32:42.614 --> 32:44.276
I want a name, McGee!

32:46.882 --> 32:48.001
He says hi!

32:52.541 --> 32:54.345
You know, the sun's starting to set.

32:55.223 --> 32:56.925
This would be a good place to camp.

32:56.985 --> 32:57.985
No, sir.

32:58.401 --> 33:01.186
- No, sir. I want to keep pushing on.
- This mountain at night,

33:01.570 --> 33:04.309
the trail starting to narrow,
big drop-offs.

33:05.278 --> 33:06.516
You got a tenderfoot.

33:07.961 --> 33:09.350
No, we camp.

33:13.490 --> 33:15.670
Can you get nerve damage
in your buttocks?

33:16.944 --> 33:18.707
You're gonna feel worse
in the morning.

33:18.767 --> 33:20.213
Don't say that, boss.

33:20.273 --> 33:21.573
- Beans?
- Yeah. Thanks.

33:22.750 --> 33:24.351
"Mongo like beans."

33:25.991 --> 33:27.014
Mongo.

33:30.331 --> 33:32.615
Mongo. Blazing Saddles.

33:33.151 --> 33:34.520
Mel Brooks, genius.

33:35.249 --> 33:37.043
What the heck is he talking about?

33:38.149 --> 33:39.320
I'm okay.

33:39.401 --> 33:42.301
I mean, I'll skip the beans, Sheriff.
Thanks for not offering, though.

33:42.494 --> 33:44.763
I got an energy bar at the airport,
so I'm good.

33:48.443 --> 33:50.081
What time is it in London, DiNozzo?

33:50.570 --> 33:51.570
It's 3:00 am.

33:51.879 --> 33:53.563
Six hours till I can make the call.

33:55.080 --> 33:57.375
You're not gonna be
with this agency much longer?

33:58.925 --> 34:01.780
You get that inheritance,
maybe you think about retiring.

34:04.699 --> 34:05.623
That's yours.

34:05.683 --> 34:08.071
I would get that, boss,
but I got a cramp in my leg.

34:11.453 --> 34:13.395
- Yeah, Gibbs.
- We played a hunch.

34:13.455 --> 34:15.098
If Bart is a professional hit man,

34:15.248 --> 34:17.907
he would be on his way to Arizona
to silence Dina Risi.

34:17.967 --> 34:19.339
The woman who knows too much.

34:19.561 --> 34:22.202
We checked all flights
from the D.C. area the last 24 hours,

34:22.262 --> 34:23.885
and I think we found something.

34:24.007 --> 34:27.083
A corporate jet filed a flight plan
from Washington Executive

34:27.143 --> 34:30.561
Hyde Field to a small airport 50 miles
from Mount Pintos.

34:30.753 --> 34:33.023
- It landed two hours ago.
- Whose plane?

34:33.083 --> 34:36.733
It's registered to the Sunset Mining
Corporation of Phoenix, Arizona.

34:36.862 --> 34:38.058
Get some sleep.

34:39.550 --> 34:41.652
- Ever heard of Sunset Mining?
- Yeah.

34:42.025 --> 34:45.119
- Who are they?
- Just a slick bunch out of Phoenix.

34:45.422 --> 34:47.804
- They got mines around here?
- Not yet, no.

34:48.266 --> 34:49.668
What's that supposed to mean?

34:50.130 --> 34:51.130
Negotiating.

34:51.310 --> 34:52.502
Negotiating for what?

34:53.226 --> 34:54.422
Mineral rights.

34:54.830 --> 34:56.351
To an abandoned gold mine.

34:56.802 --> 34:58.304
It's a waste of time, though.

34:58.364 --> 35:01.304
I got more gold in my mouth
than is in that whole shaft.

35:01.961 --> 35:03.905
Dina and her tree huggers,
they're fighting them.

35:05.094 --> 35:06.792
Claim that Sunset Mining...

35:07.314 --> 35:08.876
will rape public lands.

35:09.983 --> 35:11.815
She knows
they're not looking for gold.

35:15.043 --> 35:16.999
That's what valley fever is about,
you know.

35:17.059 --> 35:18.836
I mean,
I'm not afraid of getting it again.

35:18.896 --> 35:21.566
It's just that, you know,
Arizona is a dangerous place.

35:22.947 --> 35:25.532
- And, can we stop soon?
- Just up ahead.

35:33.275 --> 35:35.307
That one hit me where I live.

35:41.136 --> 35:43.220
Dina, stop shooting.

35:45.130 --> 35:46.423
This is Sheriff Boyd.

35:58.368 --> 36:00.176
- How did you find me?
- I didn't.

36:01.086 --> 36:03.589
These Feds did.
They're with the Navy.

36:04.187 --> 36:05.386
NCIS.

36:08.119 --> 36:10.892
Jack Patterson told me not
to talk to anyone but him.

36:11.530 --> 36:13.141
Yeah, well, Jack Patterson's dead.

36:17.492 --> 36:20.106
I mix my own pigments.

36:20.463 --> 36:23.578
As the base of my earth tones,
I use clay...

36:24.399 --> 36:26.019
that I found near the old mine.

36:26.329 --> 36:28.343
When did you suspect
the paint was radioactive?

36:28.910 --> 36:30.106
About a month ago.

36:31.620 --> 36:32.962
I wasn't feeling well.

36:33.746 --> 36:36.059
My doctor ran blood tests.

36:36.246 --> 36:38.304
Told me I was exposed to radiation.

36:38.996 --> 36:41.100
So that's what made me suspect
Sunset Mining

36:41.160 --> 36:43.000
was interested
in the mineral rights.

36:43.944 --> 36:46.027
Not for gold, but for uranium.

36:46.800 --> 36:49.574
- You tell anyone?
- I started asking questions.

36:51.122 --> 36:53.425
Thought I was discreet, but,

36:54.270 --> 36:57.349
I started getting paranoid.
Felt I was being followed.

36:58.052 --> 36:59.634
Didn't know who to trust.

37:01.870 --> 37:02.929
Called Jack.

37:03.246 --> 37:05.161
Patterson told you
to send the painting?

37:05.459 --> 37:06.459
Yeah.

37:06.692 --> 37:08.312
He said he'd have it check out.

37:12.005 --> 37:15.227
If the mine is a major source
of uranium,

37:15.979 --> 37:18.584
it could be worth billions
to Sunset Mining.

37:19.114 --> 37:20.387
Worth killing for.

37:21.152 --> 37:22.503
How did Jack die?

37:22.976 --> 37:24.900
He was shot on his way to see us.

37:25.305 --> 37:27.194
We're pretty sure
it was a professional hit.

37:27.335 --> 37:28.792
It's not safe up here.

37:29.548 --> 37:30.995
We got to get down the mountain.

37:31.059 --> 37:34.531
Great. Just when I was getting the
feeling back in my lower extremities.

37:44.166 --> 37:46.520
You know, you might want to let go
of that horn, junior.

37:46.670 --> 37:48.445
Riding a horse is like making love.

37:49.042 --> 37:50.634
You got to relax and enjoy it.

37:50.756 --> 37:53.289
Sheriff, I have a strong feeling
that you and I enjoy both

37:53.356 --> 37:56.511
of those activities in really
different ways, no disrespect.

37:59.072 --> 38:01.985
Boss, we've got you on satellite here
and MTAC. You've got company.

38:02.142 --> 38:04.272
There's an aircraft moving low
over the landscape.

38:04.394 --> 38:05.867
- What direction?
- West.

38:05.927 --> 38:07.529
It is closing in on you.

38:09.316 --> 38:11.106
- Head for the rocks.
- What's going on?

38:11.234 --> 38:12.561
Go! Move! Move!

38:31.984 --> 38:32.984
Go!

38:34.299 --> 38:35.953
Keep going! Go!

38:43.558 --> 38:44.995
The rocks. Take cover.

38:50.009 --> 38:51.009
All right.

38:51.128 --> 38:52.208
Behind the rocks.

38:52.439 --> 38:53.693
Boss, he's coming back!

38:54.965 --> 38:56.090
I'm all right, Gibbs.

38:57.867 --> 39:00.491
Get the Henry.
It pulls to the right.

39:58.339 --> 39:59.536
Boss, you okay?

40:02.288 --> 40:03.288
Boss?!

40:05.021 --> 40:06.295
Yeah. I'm fine here.

40:13.507 --> 40:15.079
Well, take it easy, Sheriff.

40:15.427 --> 40:18.516
Now we've got to round up the horses.
How do you do that?

40:25.035 --> 40:27.260
Howdy, partner.
Welcome back to the fort.

40:28.162 --> 40:29.725
I'm surprised you can sit down.

40:30.710 --> 40:32.263
You humor me, Tim.

40:33.103 --> 40:34.184
That lawyer call?

40:34.503 --> 40:36.925
Tony was notified
he would be calling at 9:00.

40:37.273 --> 40:39.183
That is just a couple minutes away.

40:39.371 --> 40:40.508
Yes, it is.

40:41.385 --> 40:43.849
- How's the sheriff, boss?
- He's going to be fine.

40:44.513 --> 40:45.718
Driving the nurses nuts.

40:45.778 --> 40:48.092
FBI lifted
a thumbprint off of his body.

40:48.381 --> 40:49.986
Real name is Jerome Sax.

40:50.046 --> 40:52.273
Lived in Oregon.
Had a wife and two kids.

40:53.789 --> 40:55.791
That's my future calling. Excuse me.

40:56.863 --> 40:59.121
Yes, Mr. Hubbard.
How are you, sir?

40:59.280 --> 41:01.641
He was a little league coach,
deacon of his church.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.205
Wife thought he was a factory rep

41:03.265 --> 41:05.306
who traveled out of town
on company business.

41:05.408 --> 41:08.659
So far, Ballistics tie him
to four unsolved murders.

41:08.765 --> 41:12.025
- They think there'll be more.
- That is unbelievable!

41:14.761 --> 41:17.133
The Phoenix D.A.'s
investigating Sunset Mining.

41:17.296 --> 41:19.896
Three executives are expected
to be indicted for the involvement

41:19.956 --> 41:23.514
in the death of Special Agent Patterson,
and the mining scam.

41:23.637 --> 41:25.519
Okay, well, thank you very much.

41:25.890 --> 41:27.221
Yes, thank you very much.

41:28.474 --> 41:29.921
All right. See you, pal.

41:33.075 --> 41:36.122
Did...
Uncle Clive leave a big estate?

41:38.418 --> 41:39.826
Huge!

41:40.222 --> 41:43.927
24 million pounds!

41:45.550 --> 41:47.711
That's over $35 million.

41:47.889 --> 41:50.282
Yes! Yes, it is!

41:53.477 --> 41:55.049
Yes, it is!

41:55.878 --> 41:58.825
And he left it all
to my sniveling cousin Crispian.

42:00.104 --> 42:03.678
I mean, I'll give you,
granted he did take care of Uncle Clive

42:04.299 --> 42:06.739
when he was ill,
and he gave a very moving eulogy.

42:08.187 --> 42:09.580
Why is the lawyer calling you?

42:12.938 --> 42:15.850
When I was in college, I borrowed
$10,000 from Uncle Clive, and,

42:16.806 --> 42:18.685
I guess I signed an IOU.

42:18.745 --> 42:22.331
I don't really remember, but Crispian
says that he found this document.

42:22.391 --> 42:24.797
Said "IOU", and that I owe him

42:24.857 --> 42:27.943
that $10,000 plus compounded
interest over the last 20 years.

42:28.497 --> 42:30.445
Do you know how much that is,
by the way?

42:34.142 --> 42:35.612
I am sorry for your loss.

42:49.131 --> 42:50.347
It's only money.
