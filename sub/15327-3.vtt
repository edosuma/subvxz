00:01.751 --> 00:05.046
- ["SpongeBob"
theme music plays]

00:05.130 --> 00:06.631
- Hey, I was watching that.

00:06.715 --> 00:08.341
- You've had the TV all day.

00:08.425 --> 00:10.468
It's the season finale
of "Project Cupcake."

00:10.552 --> 00:12.554
And you've seen this
"SpongeBob" 50 times.

00:12.637 --> 00:14.431
- I've seen them all 50 times.

00:14.514 --> 00:16.683
What's your point?

00:16.766 --> 00:17.976
- Aaron, just
give me the remote.

00:18.059 --> 00:19.227
- Give me the remote.

00:19.310 --> 00:20.812
- No, I just want--I wanna
watch "Project Cupcake."

00:20.895 --> 00:22.021
- Guys, guys, keep it down.

00:22.105 --> 00:23.440
I'm on the phone
with the caterer.

00:23.523 --> 00:25.608
Look, my client is
an animal rights foundation.

00:25.692 --> 00:30.280
I think they'll notice if you
wrap the asparagus in veal.

00:30.363 --> 00:31.865
- Stephi, Gabby
turned off "SpongeBob."

00:31.948 --> 00:33.241
- Gabby, it's
Aaron's turn with the TV.

00:33.324 --> 00:35.326
Now let me do my work.

00:35.410 --> 00:39.622
Turkey bacon is also meat.

00:39.706 --> 00:43.293
When was the last time
you planted a turkey?

00:43.376 --> 00:44.335
- Give it, Gabby.

00:44.419 --> 00:46.212
Steph said it's my turn
to have the TV.

00:46.296 --> 00:47.213
- Fine.

00:47.297 --> 00:49.257
But it's my turn
to have the remote.

00:49.340 --> 00:51.885
- Jasmine, girl, if you went
with that Chantilly frosting

00:51.968 --> 00:55.305
on a red velvet, I will lose it!

00:55.388 --> 00:57.599
- Stephanie!

00:57.682 --> 00:59.058
- Seriously?

00:59.142 --> 01:00.643
I've been waiting all season
for this, and you're going

01:00.727 --> 01:03.646
to Stephanie over some
cartoon you have memorized?

01:03.730 --> 01:05.982
- Some cartoon!

01:06.065 --> 01:08.276
Some cartoon!

01:08.359 --> 01:10.820
Stephanie!

01:10.904 --> 01:13.656
- Hey, hey, hey,
what did I say?

01:13.740 --> 01:15.325
Are you out of your mind?

01:15.408 --> 01:16.326
Lamb?

01:16.409 --> 01:17.869
Look, it's not only meat,

01:17.952 --> 01:21.331
it's the most adorable
out of all the meats.

01:21.414 --> 01:23.666
Just have your supervisor
call me.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.001
- Hey, check it.

01:25.084 --> 01:27.462
Grandma Maggie just bought me
the coolest game.

01:27.545 --> 01:29.839
Tarantula Splatter Party.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.800
I need only one little
attachment to play.

01:31.883 --> 01:32.842
- What, like an adapter?

01:32.926 --> 01:36.262
- No, I mean a 3D TV.

01:36.346 --> 01:39.015
But once we get it,
I might need that adapter.

01:39.098 --> 01:41.267
- The answer is no.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.603
- I'm glad to hear that,
because the question is

01:43.686 --> 01:47.524
can we not buy a 3D TV?

01:47.607 --> 01:49.025
- Hey!

01:49.108 --> 01:50.860
- Hi, hi, hi!

01:50.944 --> 01:53.780
Did you know that you got
a big old scratch on your car?

01:53.863 --> 01:54.572
- What?

01:54.656 --> 01:56.115
When did that happen?

01:56.199 --> 02:00.036
- About 30 seconds ago
when I drove in.

02:00.119 --> 02:02.455
- Can't we please
watch "SpongeBob?"

02:02.539 --> 02:03.540
- Really, Curtis?

02:03.623 --> 02:04.707
Meringue?

02:04.791 --> 02:07.877
Is that all they taught you
in prison?

02:07.961 --> 02:09.253
- Stupid show.

02:09.336 --> 02:11.506
"SpongeBob" is way better.

02:11.589 --> 02:13.716
A cupcake won't last
five seconds under the sea.

{\an5}- Oh, Mrs. Gosnold,
I got your message.

02:49.544 --> 02:52.255
{\an5}- Well, actually, that
message was for your husband.

02:52.338 --> 02:55.925
{\an5}But here you are...again.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.427
{\an5}- So what's going
on with Aaron?

02:57.510 --> 02:59.512
{\an5}- Aaron and his little friend
Sanders thought it would be

02:59.596 --> 03:02.265
{\an5}funny to teach the other
children Pig Latin.

03:02.348 --> 03:03.892
{\an5}Apparently, the whole class
thinks my--

03:03.975 --> 03:04.726
{\an5}[speaking Pig Latin]

03:04.809 --> 03:08.104
{\an5}Irt-shay makes me

03:08.187 --> 03:10.106
{\an5}- Well, those shoulder pads
aren't your best friend,

03:10.189 --> 03:12.066
{\an5}but I think it works.

03:12.150 --> 03:15.486
{\an5}- I'm not wearing
shoulder pads.

03:15.570 --> 03:18.781
{\an5}- Then the kids
might be ight-ray.

03:18.865 --> 03:21.117
{\an5}- Way to miss the point,
Mrs. Phillips.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.577
{\an5}Now back to our little problem.

03:22.660 --> 03:23.912
{\an5}This morning,
Sanders also said--

03:23.995 --> 03:25.121
{\an5}- Wait, wait, hold up.

03:25.204 --> 03:27.874
{\an5}I'm hearing a lot about this
Sanders kid, but I don't see

03:27.957 --> 03:30.376
{\an8}his parents
being dragged down here.

03:30.460 --> 03:33.755
{\an5}- And you won't, because
Sanders is imaginary.

03:33.838 --> 03:35.840
{\an5}- Aaron has
an imaginary friend?

03:35.924 --> 03:37.800
Well, that's not
a big deal, right?

03:37.884 --> 03:38.509
- Well not at all.

03:38.593 --> 03:40.637
I once had a student like Aaron.

03:40.720 --> 03:45.308
Poor child had a defective
stepmother, too.

03:45.391 --> 03:48.102
So, he invented an imaginary
friend to help him

03:48.186 --> 03:49.270
deal with the pain.

03:49.354 --> 03:53.149
And he turned out fine...ish.

03:53.232 --> 03:55.485
- So you're saying Aaron needs
an imaginary friend

03:55.568 --> 03:56.653
because of me?

03:56.736 --> 03:57.987
- Did I say that?

03:58.071 --> 03:58.988
No.

03:59.072 --> 03:59.447
Do I think that?

03:59.530 --> 04:01.866
Well--

04:03.660 --> 04:06.996
>> ♪

04:07.080 --> 04:09.624
- Mrs. Gosnold says you
never should have married me.

04:09.707 --> 04:11.167
- What?

04:11.250 --> 04:14.337
Did you have your parent/teacher
conference over margaritas?

04:14.420 --> 04:17.005
- Apparently, Aaron
has an imaginary friend.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.507
And she's blaming me.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.301
- Imaginary friend?

04:20.385 --> 04:22.679
You mean Sanders is back?

04:22.762 --> 04:23.888
- You know about Sanders?

04:23.972 --> 04:24.597
- Sure.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.474
He shows up once in a while.

04:26.557 --> 04:27.809
- And you don't
think that's weird?

04:27.892 --> 04:28.851
- No.

04:28.935 --> 04:31.980
I had an imaginary friend
when I was his age.

04:32.063 --> 04:36.192
Calvin Antler--
part man, part elk.

04:36.275 --> 04:38.027
We fought crime together.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.363
I was his sidekick.

04:40.446 --> 04:43.116
- You weren't even the hero
of your own fantasy life?

04:43.199 --> 04:44.158
What did you call yourself?

04:44.242 --> 04:46.619
Low self-esteem boy?

04:46.703 --> 04:47.870
- No.

04:47.954 --> 04:52.083
I was Charlie,
but I spelled it with a Y.

04:52.166 --> 04:53.835
I'm just saying there's nothing
weird about a kid having

04:53.918 --> 04:55.044
an imaginary friend.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.337
- Honey, the book says,

04:56.421 --> 04:58.715
"Imaginary friends can be
brought on my anxiety

04:58.798 --> 05:01.050
"over changes in a child's
environment."

05:01.134 --> 05:02.885
Like me starting a business,
for example.

05:02.969 --> 05:05.304
Yesterday, Aaron needed my help
with Gabby,

05:05.388 --> 05:06.597
but I was too busy working.

05:06.681 --> 05:09.350
- This has nothing to do
with you or your job.

05:09.434 --> 05:11.436
This is a phase
Aaron's going through.

05:11.519 --> 05:15.356
Like when James called
me Papa for a month.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.357
Just ignore Sanders.

05:16.441 --> 05:17.734
- No, no, no, no.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.944
We need to embrace Sanders
and treat him like he's real.

05:20.028 --> 05:21.529
- Treat him like he's real?

05:21.612 --> 05:24.866
If I imagine anything, it'll
be that we have less kids.

05:24.949 --> 05:26.743
- Honey, according to the book,
if we don't treat Sanders

05:26.826 --> 05:29.537
like he's real, we'll stifle
Aaron's creativity.

05:29.620 --> 05:31.247
- Well, he's plenty creative.

05:31.330 --> 05:35.043
Yesterday I saw him calling
a kitchen sponge Bob.

05:35.126 --> 05:38.463
Oh, I just got that.

05:38.546 --> 05:43.342
- Honey, if this is my fault,
let me fix it my way.

05:43.426 --> 05:44.385
- Fine.

05:44.469 --> 05:48.181
I wonder what happened
to old Calvin Antler.

05:48.264 --> 05:50.433
He used to talk about
opening a restaurant.

05:50.516 --> 05:54.479
I was going to be his sous chef.

05:54.562 --> 05:55.563
What?

05:55.646 --> 05:58.524
- Maybe we should
have dated longer.

05:58.608 --> 06:01.778
- ♪

06:03.362 --> 06:06.699
- Sanders is here, and
he was watching that.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.076
- Sanders is back?

06:08.159 --> 06:10.620
I hate that idiot.

06:10.703 --> 06:12.205
He's always insulting me.

06:12.288 --> 06:13.790
- But he's funny.

06:13.873 --> 06:15.208
What's that, Sanders?

06:15.291 --> 06:18.127
Uh, that's a good one,
but a little too far.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.254
She is my sister.

06:20.338 --> 06:21.464
- Thank you, Aaron.

06:21.547 --> 06:23.424
- He says you should get
dressed with the lights on.

06:23.508 --> 06:26.094
- [scoffs]

06:26.177 --> 06:29.138
Don't engage, Gabby,
you're better than that.

06:29.222 --> 06:33.059
- He says, "No, you're not."

06:33.142 --> 06:35.311
- Bad news, James,
Sanders is back?

06:35.394 --> 06:36.145
- Sanders?

06:36.229 --> 06:37.480
The dude from your head?

06:37.563 --> 06:38.648
He's funny.

06:38.731 --> 06:41.984
Love the one about Gabby
having big old feet.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.821
- Yeah, well at least
my feet are visible.

06:44.904 --> 06:47.657
- From space.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.158
Sanders said it.

06:49.242 --> 06:52.745
- Classic, Sanders.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.997
- Hey, Aaron, there you are.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.624
Guess what?

06:56.707 --> 06:59.961
I canceled a couple of meeting,
canceled on a few clients so we

07:00.044 --> 07:02.839
can spend the whole afternoon
together making cookies.

07:02.922 --> 07:06.759
You, me and Sanders.

07:06.843 --> 07:09.262
- Hey, you know what we could
do while we eat those cookies?

07:09.345 --> 07:13.141
Order ourselves a new 3D TV.

07:13.224 --> 07:14.684
They'll take
your engagement ring in trade.

07:14.767 --> 07:17.311
I've already had it appraised.

07:17.395 --> 07:18.563
- Let it go, James.

07:18.646 --> 07:19.772
Come on, Aaron.

07:19.856 --> 07:21.399
Come on, Sanders.

07:21.482 --> 07:23.860
All right,
would you and Sanders

07:23.943 --> 07:27.363
like chocolate chip cookies or
oatmeal raisin?

07:27.446 --> 07:30.366
- Sanders says, "Why choose?"

07:30.449 --> 07:31.868
- Two batches coming up.

07:31.951 --> 07:34.328
If we have extra, me and
Sanders can take them school.

07:34.412 --> 07:38.291
- Actually, Sanders can't
go to school anymore.

07:38.374 --> 07:39.917
He got suspended.

07:40.001 --> 07:40.877
- Okay.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.211
I'll leave him at home.

07:42.295 --> 07:45.173
He was being a nuisance anyway.

07:45.256 --> 07:48.009
- Hi, hi, hi.

07:48.092 --> 07:51.554
So, the car guys gave me
an estimate

07:51.637 --> 07:55.266
for your teeny-weeny scratch.

07:55.349 --> 07:57.894
They're crooks.

07:57.977 --> 07:58.728
You got any silver nail polish?

07:58.811 --> 07:59.812
- Silver?

07:59.896 --> 08:01.856
My car's blue.

08:01.939 --> 08:02.815
Charlie's is silver.

08:02.899 --> 08:06.235
- I know.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.237
- You hit Charlie's car, too?

08:08.321 --> 08:12.909
- Why you all up
in my business?

08:12.992 --> 08:14.076
So what are we doing?

08:14.160 --> 08:16.329
- Stephanie's making
cookies for me and Sanders.

08:16.412 --> 08:18.956
- Sanders is Aaron's friend who
we all can plainly see

08:19.040 --> 08:21.584
in this kitchen right now.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.753
- Actually, Sanders
went to the backyard.

08:23.836 --> 08:25.588
We're gonna play hide and seek.

08:25.671 --> 08:28.132
He's amazing at that game.

08:31.552 --> 08:34.179
- I can't stand
imaginary friends.

08:34.263 --> 08:35.597
I remember when you had one.

08:35.681 --> 08:36.599
- I had one?

08:36.682 --> 08:38.976
- Oh, you don't remember Peggy?

08:39.059 --> 08:45.107
Picky little Peggy.

08:45.191 --> 08:50.446
Complained about everything,
even when you were fine with it.

08:50.529 --> 08:54.825
Ugly child.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.118
As I imagined her.

08:56.202 --> 08:59.413
- I don't remember her at all.

08:59.497 --> 09:03.125
- Well, you and I were going to
fly to visit your Aunt Cecil.

09:03.209 --> 09:08.673
And you refused to go unless
I bought Peggy her own seat.

09:08.756 --> 09:09.674
- You did that?

09:09.757 --> 09:13.636
- No!

09:13.719 --> 09:16.847
I backed up over
Peggy in the driveway.

09:16.931 --> 09:19.267
- [scoffs]

09:19.350 --> 09:24.272
- End of Peggy, end of story.

09:24.355 --> 09:26.440
- Well, things are different
around here, because

09:26.524 --> 09:30.653
I happen to honor and respect
my kid's feelings.

09:30.736 --> 09:32.655

18:44.039 --> 18:45.457
- Wait a minute.

18:45.541 --> 18:48.544
Did Sanders just
take a shot at me?

18:48.627 --> 18:51.380
All right, that's it!

18:51.463 --> 18:53.465
- He's not there anymore.

18:53.549 --> 18:54.883
Nope.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.553
- Just tell me where he is.

18:57.636 --> 18:58.720
- You know what?

18:58.804 --> 18:59.888
I have had enough of you.

18:59.972 --> 19:05.644
And to think I
baked you cookies.

19:05.727 --> 19:10.399
So long, Sanders!

19:10.482 --> 19:11.233
Aaron, get your backpack.

19:11.316 --> 19:16.154
We're leaving for school
right now.

19:16.238 --> 19:19.908
- Did you just throw
Sanders out in the yard?

19:19.992 --> 19:21.159
- Yes, I did.

19:21.243 --> 19:22.411
Problem?

19:22.494 --> 19:23.537
- I'm just saying, isn't that
what Grandma Maggie

19:23.620 --> 19:25.414
did to your imaginary friend?

19:25.497 --> 19:26.999
- Uh, completely different.

19:27.082 --> 19:28.917
Grandma Maggie ran over Peggy
with her car.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.586
I only threw him in the yard.

19:30.669 --> 19:31.962
He's fine.

19:32.045 --> 19:32.880

19:33.964 --> 19:35.966
- Sanders!

19:40.512 --> 19:43.599
- Well, looks like I took care
of you all little problem.

19:48.645 --> 19:54.443
On a related note, you're
gonna need a new mailbox.

19:57.571 --> 20:00.908
- Okay, Aaron, I've got
a few words for Sanders.

20:00.991 --> 20:03.785
Did somebody leave
a bag of trash in here?

20:03.869 --> 20:05.454
Or is that just Sanders?

20:05.537 --> 20:09.082
Bam!

20:09.166 --> 20:12.127
When Sanders was born,
the doctor slapped his mother.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.170
What?

20:13.253 --> 20:16.131
[laughs]

20:16.214 --> 20:17.299
And you can tell him

20:17.382 --> 20:19.134
there's plenty more
where that came from.

20:19.217 --> 20:22.095
Hmm.

20:22.179 --> 20:24.806
- I thought Grandma Maggie
ran Sanders over this morning.

20:24.890 --> 20:25.891
- She did.

20:25.974 --> 20:28.810
I'm just letting Gabby
