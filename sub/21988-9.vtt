00:03.471 --> 00:05.339
RADIO DEEJAY: Stay tuned
for your morning traffic

00:05.373 --> 00:08.042
at the top of the hour
after this smooth jazz.

00:08.076 --> 00:09.277
(smooth jazz playing over radio)

00:09.310 --> 00:12.146
(sniffs, scoffs)

00:12.180 --> 00:15.449
Three dollars for a paper cup
of burnt mud?

00:15.483 --> 00:18.219
Only in America.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.623
Do forgive my English.

00:22.656 --> 00:24.392
In what language
should I repeat that?

00:24.425 --> 00:27.061
Or perhaps I could
speak more slowly.

00:27.095 --> 00:28.662
No, it's cool, mister.

00:28.696 --> 00:31.099
I got it.
Let me make you

00:31.132 --> 00:32.366
a fresh pot.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.068
(ringtone plays)

00:38.872 --> 00:41.742
Hey. How long has
your phone been on?

00:41.775 --> 00:44.078
Just half hour or so.

00:44.112 --> 00:45.813
What did I tell you?

00:45.846 --> 00:47.181
Oh, relax, Andre,
would you?

00:47.215 --> 00:49.517
No phones until
the job is done.

00:49.550 --> 00:52.153
Job is done and it's
my mother from Kiev.

00:52.186 --> 00:54.555
What son doesn't answer
his mother's calls, huh?

00:54.588 --> 00:56.090
Just make it quick.

00:56.124 --> 00:57.791
You worry too much.

01:09.203 --> 01:10.438
(dog barking in distance)

01:13.541 --> 01:15.109
Hello, Andre.

01:15.143 --> 01:17.178
Well done, MI5.

01:17.211 --> 01:19.780
Uh, Mr. Ford, is it?

01:19.813 --> 01:22.283
Congratulations.
You found me.

01:22.316 --> 01:25.253
Blasted thing gets the spottiest
reception in the States,

01:25.286 --> 01:28.189
but the tracking feature turned
out to be quite remarkable.

01:28.222 --> 01:30.224
Leaves me
with one question.
Hmm?

01:30.258 --> 01:31.592
Did I find you in time?

01:31.625 --> 01:33.294
In time for what exactly?

01:33.327 --> 01:36.230
All right.
Let's make it two questions.

01:36.264 --> 01:41.302
My answer to the first
is you are far too late.

01:41.335 --> 01:43.571
And the second?

01:48.809 --> 01:50.144
(both groan)

01:52.213 --> 01:53.547
(groans)

01:53.581 --> 01:55.683
Oh, no.

01:55.716 --> 01:57.818
Is this because of me?

01:59.420 --> 02:01.289
(groans)

02:02.956 --> 02:06.294
(gasps)

02:08.396 --> 02:11.265
(van door closes, engine starts)

02:11.299 --> 02:12.266
(tires squealing)

02:12.300 --> 02:13.534
(line ringing)

02:13.567 --> 02:14.935
SLOANE:
Hello?

02:14.968 --> 02:16.270
(gasping)

02:16.304 --> 02:17.805
Hey, Ford?

02:17.838 --> 02:19.240
Nigel?

02:19.273 --> 02:20.274
Are you there?

02:20.308 --> 02:21.642
Hello?

02:21.675 --> 02:23.677
*

02:54.342 --> 02:56.444
Put me down for some of them
sweet potatoes.

02:56.477 --> 02:58.412
BISHOP: Abby already called
sweet potatoes,

02:58.446 --> 03:01.349
but we still need
cranberries and...

03:01.382 --> 03:02.716
REEVES: Cranberries.
I'll bring those.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.752
Okay.
No one
wants me cooking.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.587
How many tins
you think we'll need?

03:06.620 --> 03:07.655
TORRES:
"Tins"?

03:07.688 --> 03:08.989
You mean cranberries
in cans?

03:09.022 --> 03:11.425
Some people
actually prefer them.

03:11.459 --> 03:13.261
This is my first
Thanksgiving, Nick.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.428
Well, don't make it your last.

03:14.462 --> 03:15.429
Bring as many

03:15.463 --> 03:16.597
"tins" as you want.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.699
I have a cranberry recipe.

03:18.732 --> 03:19.900
We'll compare.
Hey, McGee,

03:19.933 --> 03:21.402
what about you and Delilah?

03:21.435 --> 03:22.836
You guys coming to
Ducky's potluck tomorrow?

03:22.870 --> 03:24.905
Oh, we may have to take
a rain check on that one.

03:24.938 --> 03:25.939
Is Delilah feeling okay?

03:25.973 --> 03:27.375
McGEE:
Oh, way better than me.

03:27.408 --> 03:28.609
No, I've been up all night

03:28.642 --> 03:31.011
building a second
easy-to-assemble crib.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.413
Got three pieces
left over--

03:32.446 --> 03:33.914
Flurgendoofs,
I think they call them.

03:33.947 --> 03:36.317
I don't know what
to do with them.

03:36.350 --> 03:39.453
I still don't understand how
it's medically possible

03:39.487 --> 03:41.422
for you two to not have
known you were having...

03:41.455 --> 03:43.424
twins.
McGEE:
The shrapnel

03:43.457 --> 03:46.460
in Delilah's spine made it
so that a regular ultrasound

03:46.494 --> 03:48.028
is impossible
and the babies' heartbeats

03:48.061 --> 03:50.398
are so close together
in rhythm,

03:50.431 --> 03:52.400
doctors just missed it.
It's crazy.

03:52.433 --> 03:53.801
Yeah, what's even crazier
is that we now

03:53.834 --> 03:55.469
have to come up
with two babies' names.

03:55.503 --> 03:57.805
Nick McGee. Ooh.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.307
Has a nice ring to it.
McGEE:
No, no, no.

03:59.340 --> 04:01.975
For the, for the boy,
we've got it narrowed down

04:02.009 --> 04:05.646
to Indiana, Han, Harrison.

04:05.679 --> 04:07.448
REEVES:
Oh, gosh.

04:07.481 --> 04:08.482
Poor kid.

04:08.516 --> 04:09.883
Han McGee.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.785
Yeah, and for the girl...
BISHOP:
Let me guess.

04:11.819 --> 04:13.887
Leia?
No. No Leias.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.989
No Ellies, no Abbys.
We've narrowed it down

04:16.023 --> 04:18.492
to six names for the girl
and they are...

04:18.526 --> 04:20.394
Ah, save it for
later, McGee.

04:20.428 --> 04:21.729
Saved by the bell.

04:21.762 --> 04:24.031
Dead MI5 officer
in Old Town.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.866
MI5?

04:25.899 --> 04:28.336
Friend of Sloane's.

04:28.369 --> 04:30.371
(siren wailing)

04:32.373 --> 04:34.074
You know what happened?

04:34.107 --> 04:35.075
(helicopter whirring)

04:35.108 --> 04:36.544
What?

04:36.577 --> 04:37.878
Hey. No.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.982
He called me right before,
uh, he, uh...

04:42.015 --> 04:44.017
The store owner's the only...

04:44.051 --> 04:47.455
the only, uh,
witness, apparently.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.490
I'll check the
security footage.

04:50.458 --> 04:51.692
REEVES:
Is that Nigel Ford?

04:51.725 --> 04:53.527
You knew him?

04:53.561 --> 04:56.497
Somewhat of a legend
at our training academy.

04:56.530 --> 04:58.832
Cool bloke,
great officer.

04:58.866 --> 05:00.834
We all wanted to be him.

05:00.868 --> 05:03.437
Yeah.
You worked with him?

05:03.471 --> 05:05.939
Special joint operation
two years ago.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.576
Reconnected when he got
into town last week, so...

05:08.609 --> 05:10.110
REEVES: Last I heard,
he was chasing

05:10.143 --> 05:12.646
some international
arms dealer.
Andre Yorka.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.648
That's the name.
SLOANE:
That was our case.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.484
Nigel tracked him
all the way back here

05:16.517 --> 05:18.452
after he snuck in
on a fake visa.

05:18.486 --> 05:20.654
I was supposed to deliver
my old files to him tonight.

05:20.688 --> 05:22.456
Try to figure out
what old Andre was up to.

05:22.490 --> 05:24.458
But what was old
Andre up to, Jack?

05:24.492 --> 05:25.859
Well, nothing good.

05:27.628 --> 05:29.430
That's pretty clear right now,
isn't it?

05:29.463 --> 05:31.865
Hey, uh, is this your
arms dealer over here?

05:31.899 --> 05:34.435
No. I don't know who that is.

05:34.468 --> 05:36.404
I have Yorka's picture
back at my office.

05:36.437 --> 05:37.538
Might have one here.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.807
Clerk I.D.'d this
man as the shooter.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.143
That's him. That's Yorka.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.413
Fingerprint came back.

05:45.446 --> 05:48.682
Second victim is
Viktor Lopuchin, 42,

05:48.716 --> 05:50.684
Baltimore resident,
currently employed

05:50.718 --> 05:52.653
in commercial food delivery.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.388
Cops said he was unarmed.

05:54.422 --> 05:55.689
REEVES:
Innocent bystander, maybe?

05:55.723 --> 05:57.157
TORRES:
And this may be Yorka.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.393
Or at least his blood.

05:59.427 --> 06:00.994
Trail ends around here.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.431
Burnt rubber points to
a fast getaway.

06:03.464 --> 06:06.967
Get a BOLO out on Yorka.
Armed, wounded, dangerous.

06:08.469 --> 06:10.404
Abby, can I call you back?

06:10.438 --> 06:11.439
ABBY:
No, you can't.

06:11.472 --> 06:12.940
I mean, everything's fine

06:12.973 --> 06:14.808
and there's no reason to panic.
(engine revving)

06:14.842 --> 06:16.477
Well, why do
you sound panicky?

06:16.510 --> 06:18.446
(exhales)
My water broke, Tim.

06:18.479 --> 06:19.447
Delilah?
ABBY:
I-I just,

06:19.480 --> 06:20.581
I went over to your place

06:20.614 --> 06:21.915
for breakfast and
it just happened.

06:21.949 --> 06:23.551
Uh, uh, are-are you okay?
Is she okay?

06:23.584 --> 06:25.553
I'm okay.
She's okay.

06:25.586 --> 06:27.755
She-she's just,
she's breathing really hard.

06:27.788 --> 06:28.956
How did this happen? I mean,

06:28.989 --> 06:30.491
you're not due
for another three weeks.

06:30.524 --> 06:32.760
Well, apparently, the babies
had other plans, darling.

06:32.793 --> 06:34.828
Just meet us at the hospital.

06:36.697 --> 06:37.831
Wait. Wait, Abbs.

06:37.865 --> 06:38.932
GIBBS:
McGee.

06:38.966 --> 06:40.033
Go.

06:41.201 --> 06:43.103
Go!

06:53.481 --> 06:55.816
Excuse me, an emergency.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.117
(siren wailing)

06:57.150 --> 06:58.819
Excuse me, very urgent.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.220
Oh, no.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.922
Uh, excuse me, excuse me.

07:01.955 --> 07:03.223
Has-has my wife
come through here yet?

07:03.256 --> 07:04.825
We're having a
baby-- two of 'em.

07:04.858 --> 07:07.628
Special Agent McGee,
follow me.

07:12.032 --> 07:16.169
A little VIP treatment for a
fellow law enforcement officer.

07:16.203 --> 07:19.473
Morgan Cade,
retired park police.

07:19.507 --> 07:22.510
Took this job last year
after my wife died.

07:22.543 --> 07:23.844
Pretty short
on excitement,

07:23.877 --> 07:25.212
so when the goth girl
wheeled your wife

07:25.245 --> 07:27.047
into my E.R.,

07:27.080 --> 07:28.949
(clicks tongue)
I got ready for action.

07:28.982 --> 07:31.552
Twins, huh?

07:31.585 --> 07:34.822
Son, your life's about
to change forever.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.658
(elevator bell dings)

07:37.691 --> 07:39.226
(indistinct radio chatter)

07:40.728 --> 07:42.129
MORGAN:
Here's your man.

07:42.162 --> 07:44.464
(sighing):
Oh, McGee.

07:45.533 --> 07:47.501
Thank you, Morgan.

07:47.535 --> 07:48.869
Where is she?

07:48.902 --> 07:50.838
Um, she's okay,
I think.

07:50.871 --> 07:52.506
The doctor's
working on her now.

07:52.540 --> 07:53.907
W-W-Working on her how?

07:53.941 --> 07:55.208
You would be Tim?

07:55.242 --> 07:56.610
Where's my wife?
Can I see her?

07:56.644 --> 07:58.278
She's with Dr. Serena now.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.914
Just a routine exam.
No need to be concerned.

08:00.948 --> 08:02.983
Well, then let me see her.
NURSE: In just a few minutes.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.918
I promise you,
she's in good hands.

08:04.952 --> 08:06.887
Make that very
good hands.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.089
I've seen some amazing
things at this hospital,

08:09.122 --> 08:11.291
so you let the doctors
do what they got to do

08:11.324 --> 08:14.728
and I can promise you
it'll all work out for the best.

08:14.762 --> 08:16.163
(baby cries)

08:18.098 --> 08:19.499
(baby coos)

08:24.104 --> 08:26.607
Officer Nigel Ford,
42 years old.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.976
Royal Air Force,
Scotland Yard.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.178
Joined MI5 in 2010
as a covert operative

08:31.211 --> 08:33.614
assigned to monitor
global threats.

08:33.647 --> 08:34.915
Monitor what exactly?

08:34.948 --> 08:37.317
BISHOP:
Andre Yorka, 38.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.986
Dishonorably discharged
from the Serbian Army

08:39.019 --> 08:41.955
in '06; ran with the
National Alignment hate group

08:41.989 --> 08:44.625
a few years, before
his late father

08:44.658 --> 08:46.093
got him into the
munitions trade.

08:46.126 --> 08:49.797
Now, Yorka fancies himself
a master dealmaker,

08:49.830 --> 08:51.331
but he has made far more enemies

08:51.364 --> 08:53.200
than allies
over the years.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.302
Shady business practices
got him banned

08:55.335 --> 08:57.605
from several countries,
and most recently,

08:57.638 --> 09:00.574
Romania, which froze his assets
just last year.

09:00.608 --> 09:03.043
REEVES: Bad things always seem
to happen when this guy pops up.

09:03.076 --> 09:04.878
MI5's been trying to nail him
for years,

09:04.912 --> 09:06.847
always manages
to skate free.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.583
He hires local talent
and leaves them behind

09:09.617 --> 09:10.483
to take the fall.

09:10.517 --> 09:12.620
Like our innocent bystander
at the store.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.588
He's not so
innocent after all.

09:14.622 --> 09:16.123
Before immigrating
to the U.S.,

09:16.156 --> 09:19.927
Viktor Lopuchin had ties to
Vory v Zakone, the Russian mob.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.762
His record's been
clean in the U.S.

09:21.795 --> 09:24.932
since he started a-a food
delivery business in Baltimore.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.299
Old habits die hard.

09:26.333 --> 09:27.901
If Yorka hires local talent...

09:27.935 --> 09:29.637
BISHOP:
What did he hire Viktor to do?

09:29.670 --> 09:31.371
All right. Keep digging on both.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.106
Any surveillance
from the shooting?

09:33.140 --> 09:34.274
Metro's sending it over.

09:34.307 --> 09:35.676
I'll call and have them hurry.

09:35.709 --> 09:36.944
What about Sloane?

09:39.146 --> 09:40.681
Anybody seen Sloane?

09:43.651 --> 09:44.952
What?

09:44.985 --> 09:47.721
She's down in Autopsy.

09:53.126 --> 09:55.162
JIMMY:
I appreciate the assist, Doctor.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.264
Stuffing the turkey
can wait.

09:57.297 --> 09:59.399
We have more
pressing matters.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.169
Once MI5 asked to have
both bodies examined,

10:02.202 --> 10:03.804
I suddenly found
myself shorthanded.

10:03.837 --> 10:06.373
Should we divide and conquer?

10:06.406 --> 10:08.141
JIMMY (quietly):
No, let's, uh...

10:08.175 --> 10:09.276
let's both start here.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.311
At least until...

10:11.344 --> 10:12.913
SLOANE: Hey, Jimmy,
just let me know

10:12.946 --> 10:14.982
when you need me to
get out of here, okay?

10:17.450 --> 10:19.086
He meant a lot to you.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.788
Mm-hmm.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.690
JIMMY:
Was he...?

10:22.723 --> 10:24.024
I mean, were you two...?

10:24.057 --> 10:25.292
(laughs)

10:25.325 --> 10:27.027
Occasionally.

10:27.060 --> 10:29.396
Uh, no, he was a...

10:29.429 --> 10:31.398
he was a really good friend.

10:31.431 --> 10:33.400
Shoot, I forgot
to tell him that.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.736
I forgot to thank him.

10:35.769 --> 10:38.038
I believe you just did.

10:38.071 --> 10:40.407
I swear to God, if Yorka
did this, I would give anything

10:40.440 --> 10:41.709
to kick his ass.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.143
Put me in a front-row seat.

10:43.176 --> 10:46.046
Gibbs, he is a racist,
misogynistic creep,

10:46.079 --> 10:48.115
and when we do find him,
I swear I am going to...

10:48.148 --> 10:49.717
Okay. I got it, I got it.

10:49.750 --> 10:52.352
I got it.
We'll see what we can do.

10:54.054 --> 10:55.388
Duck.

10:55.422 --> 10:56.890
We just put him
on the table, Jethro.

10:56.924 --> 10:58.792
Perhaps in an hour...

10:58.826 --> 10:59.793
What are you doing?

10:59.827 --> 11:01.261
What's that smell?

11:01.294 --> 11:02.696
That smell, what is that?

11:02.730 --> 11:04.097
Is that...
(sniffing)

11:04.131 --> 11:05.398
gasoline?

11:05.432 --> 11:07.234
That gun powder?

11:07.267 --> 11:08.401
Plastique.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.771
Like Semtex? C-4?
Uh-huh.

11:10.804 --> 11:13.941
Dr. Sloane, if plastic
explosives are involved,

11:13.974 --> 11:17.144
your friend's killer may deserve
more than a kick in the ass.

11:23.283 --> 11:24.952
Delilah, honey, are you okay?

11:24.985 --> 11:26.386
Babe, you made it.
Yeah, I'm fine.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.421
Better than fine.
She's ready.

11:28.455 --> 11:29.790
She's ready?

11:29.823 --> 11:31.925
Early labor's fairly common
with twins.

11:31.959 --> 11:34.427
I hope we told you that.
Well, if you
had told me that,

11:34.461 --> 11:36.964
I would have been there
for breakfast every day.

11:36.997 --> 11:38.231
Well, it's a good thing
you were.

11:38.265 --> 11:39.900
There could have been
complications,

11:39.933 --> 11:41.468
but you got her here
just in time.

11:41.501 --> 11:43.236
So, this is happening?

11:43.270 --> 11:44.938
In the next few hours.

11:44.972 --> 11:46.006
Ready or not.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.140
In the meantime,

11:47.174 --> 11:49.910
try to relax.
(exhales)

11:49.943 --> 11:51.144
I'll be back.

11:51.178 --> 11:52.445
Mm-hmm. Thank you.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.982
Relax?

11:55.015 --> 11:56.216
How can anyone relax?

11:56.249 --> 11:58.018
Tim.
Sorry.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.753
I can relax. We can relax.

11:59.787 --> 12:01.354
I brought your comfort kit.

12:01.388 --> 12:02.422
Your comfort kit?

12:02.455 --> 12:03.523
From birthing class.

12:03.556 --> 12:04.792
Only that's not my kit, Tim.

12:04.825 --> 12:05.926
Mine's in my car.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.928
Yes, but I got a duplicate
in my car.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.329
Look at this.
I brought your...

12:09.362 --> 12:11.331
favorite comic books, uh,

12:11.364 --> 12:13.166
we got...

12:13.200 --> 12:15.368
your mini fan right here,

12:15.402 --> 12:18.038
and, of course,
your aromatherapy bear.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.840
Oh, thank you.
Okay, that's too sweet.

12:19.873 --> 12:22.042
Like, seriously,
it's, like, too sweet.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.344
Is there anything else you need,
Dee? Just tell me right now.

12:24.377 --> 12:25.512
You know what I'd kill for?
Huh?

12:25.545 --> 12:27.014
Grape soda. Ice-cold.

12:27.047 --> 12:28.215
Okay.
Wait, wait, wait.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.316
Wait, wait. I'll go.

12:29.349 --> 12:30.283
Oh, no, no! Please, let Tim go.

12:30.317 --> 12:32.820
Tim knows just the kind I like.
Right, babe?

12:32.853 --> 12:34.387
Grape soda.
Ice-cold. Sit tight.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.823
(Delilah sighs)

12:35.856 --> 12:37.490
I love you.

12:37.524 --> 12:41.094
You should've let me go.
He needs to be here.

12:41.128 --> 12:42.930
No, he needs a task
when he's nervous.

12:42.963 --> 12:45.432
I can't even drink grape soda
right now. (exhales)

12:45.465 --> 12:47.567
I'm not allowed to drink
anything while I'm in labor.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.403
You're really good. Hey, um,
you think you could, uh,

12:50.437 --> 12:54.207
give me a task, too? 'Cause
I'm, like, really nervous.

12:54.241 --> 12:57.811
Yeah, actually. Could you just
feed me ice chips on demand?

12:57.845 --> 12:59.446
Okay? And just...

12:59.479 --> 13:01.882
uh, listen to me when I...
(shouting)

13:01.915 --> 13:02.549
(shouting)

13:04.351 --> 13:07.821
I'll make sure
the nurses know.

13:07.855 --> 13:10.824
MAN (over P.A.):
Report to the E.R., please.

13:10.858 --> 13:12.893
(elevator bell dings)

13:14.561 --> 13:16.463
Hey, big daddy,

13:16.496 --> 13:18.365
what are you doing down here?
How's your girl?

13:18.398 --> 13:20.567
She's good. We're, uh...
we're ready.

13:20.600 --> 13:23.003
Listen, Morgan, thank you
so much for all your help.

13:23.036 --> 13:26.406
Well, that's what fellow law
enforcement officers do, right?

13:26.439 --> 13:29.142
We help. What about you?
What do you need?

13:29.176 --> 13:30.844
Is there a soda machine
around here?

13:30.878 --> 13:32.913
The cafeteria
doesn't have grape.

13:32.946 --> 13:34.848
Say no more. Follow me.

13:40.921 --> 13:43.190
MORGAN:
Here you go.

13:43.223 --> 13:45.959
And it even has grape.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.199
What's wrong?

13:52.232 --> 13:53.600
McGEE:
I don't believe it.

13:53.633 --> 13:54.902
It's him.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.303
It's who?

13:56.336 --> 13:57.905
McGEE:
It's Yorka.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.615
All right. Thanks.

14:08.648 --> 14:10.617
That was Baltimore PD.

14:10.650 --> 14:13.486
They're still searching Viktor's
apartment, but no red flags yet.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.322
Maybe because he hasn't
been there in days.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.456
What do you got?

14:16.489 --> 14:17.490
Viktor's credit card shows
he booked

14:17.524 --> 14:19.492
a room at the Westcott Hotel

14:19.526 --> 14:20.660
in Georgetown
two days ago

14:20.693 --> 14:22.262
and still hasn't checked out.

14:22.295 --> 14:24.932
The Westcott.
That place is huge.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.399
TORRES: Let's
get over there.
Count me in.

14:26.433 --> 14:28.936
(phone rings)
Hang on, hang on. I got McGee.

14:29.937 --> 14:30.904
Hey, McGee.

14:30.938 --> 14:32.405
You got us all.

14:32.439 --> 14:34.074
Give me some good news.

14:34.107 --> 14:35.575
Boss, he's here.

14:35.608 --> 14:36.576
What?

14:36.609 --> 14:38.078
Who's where?

14:38.111 --> 14:39.947
Who's here?
What's going on?

14:39.980 --> 14:42.682
Hold on, boss. Morgan,
there is a guy against

14:42.715 --> 14:44.584
the back wall there.
He's got a dark jacket.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.954
Some kind of leg injury. I need
you to keep an eye on him.

14:46.987 --> 14:48.355
Why? What did he do?

14:48.388 --> 14:51.224
Well, it doesn't matter,
but if he is who I think he is,

14:51.258 --> 14:52.692
he's a very bad guy.

14:52.725 --> 14:55.929
So just keep an eye on him until
I can get backup down here.

14:55.963 --> 14:57.664
Roger that. I'm on it.
All right.

14:57.697 --> 15:00.567
GIBBS: McGee!
Uh, sorry, boss.

15:00.600 --> 15:01.935
What bad guy, McGee?

15:01.969 --> 15:04.004
Our bad guy. Sloane's bad guy.

15:04.037 --> 15:05.939
Yorka?
Wounded, bleeding,

15:05.973 --> 15:07.274
and a dead ringer
for the guy on my phone.

15:07.307 --> 15:08.976
We'll get to you soon, huh?

15:11.611 --> 15:13.013
MORGAN: Thank you.
It shouldn't be long.

15:13.046 --> 15:14.614
(groans)

15:14.647 --> 15:16.649
Hey, uh,
sorry for the wait, fella,

15:16.683 --> 15:18.618
but it shouldn't be
too much longer.

15:18.651 --> 15:19.552
It's too long for me.

15:19.586 --> 15:20.620
Well, look, uh,
that leg looks pretty bad.

15:20.653 --> 15:23.090
Let me see if I can jump you
ahead in line, huh?

15:23.123 --> 15:26.293
Look, just hold on, now.
Just wait a minute!

15:26.326 --> 15:28.962
(people gasping)
Oh, God.

15:28.996 --> 15:30.130
Drop it!
Everybody out!

15:30.163 --> 15:32.732
NCIS!
You drop it!

15:32.765 --> 15:34.567
Stay back!

15:34.601 --> 15:36.736
Take it easy. No one else
needs to get hurt.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.139
Everyone gets hurt!
You understand me?

15:39.172 --> 15:41.541
Patch me up, get me out of here

15:41.574 --> 15:43.443
or everybody gets hurt!

15:43.476 --> 15:45.212
GIBBS:
Bishop, Sloane,

15:45.245 --> 15:47.080
you're with me.
Torres, Reeves, hotel room.

15:47.114 --> 15:49.016
Wait, really?

15:49.049 --> 15:50.650
REEVES: Hotel? Are you serious?
Gibbs, you heard McGee.

15:50.683 --> 15:52.452
Yeah, I did. And before
that, I heard about a guy

15:52.485 --> 15:53.987
who might be making a
bomb in a hotel room

15:54.021 --> 15:55.222
in Georgetown.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.024
Gibbs...
Hey, if there's
nothing going on,

15:57.057 --> 15:59.026
then come to the
hospital. Got it?
Gibbs...

15:59.059 --> 16:01.661
Do you got it?

16:01.694 --> 16:03.563
Please, just let me help him.

16:03.596 --> 16:06.666
(strained): I'm okay.
No cops. I want no cops!

16:06.699 --> 16:09.736
I can't guarantee that. You know
someone called them the moment

16:09.769 --> 16:11.671
you pulled that trigger.
Then drop your gun.

16:11.704 --> 16:13.306
Don't drop it! Shoot him!

16:13.340 --> 16:14.407
Shut up!

16:15.208 --> 16:16.776
Oh!

16:16.809 --> 16:19.779
Let her go!
Then drop your gun!

16:19.812 --> 16:21.714
Okay, okay.

16:21.748 --> 16:25.052
Look.

16:25.085 --> 16:26.619
Now slide it over.

16:31.091 --> 16:32.425
You want to die right now,
old man?!

16:32.459 --> 16:35.028
No. No. Nobody dies.

16:35.062 --> 16:36.429
No one else
is gonna die today, Yorka.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.065
No one else, huh?

16:38.098 --> 16:39.532
You know my name.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.201
Look, one thing at a time.

16:41.234 --> 16:43.170
Now, we need
to get you patched up.

16:43.203 --> 16:44.237
But, first,

16:44.271 --> 16:45.505
you got to let them go.

16:45.538 --> 16:48.075
I don't have to do anything.

16:48.108 --> 16:49.109
(siren approaching)

16:49.142 --> 16:52.412
Then let the girl go.

16:52.445 --> 16:53.746
Don't worry about me!

16:53.780 --> 16:55.515
(woman screams)

16:55.548 --> 16:57.617
Keep your mouth shut, old man!

16:57.650 --> 16:59.819
Or else the next bullet
goes right here.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.254
No, there's no need
for that, okay?

17:01.288 --> 17:02.489
Look, we'll-we'll get you help

17:02.522 --> 17:03.690
and we'll get you out of here.

17:03.723 --> 17:05.325
I'm hearing a lot of talk.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.693
Doctors!

17:06.726 --> 17:07.794
Hello? Is there
a doctor here?!

17:07.827 --> 17:09.829
We need help!

17:09.862 --> 17:11.098
Nice try.

17:11.131 --> 17:13.100
Now go and get a doctor!

17:13.133 --> 17:15.068
And don't come back
till you have one.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.105
(grunts)

17:18.771 --> 17:21.174
No.
What?

17:22.842 --> 17:24.311
(sirens approaching)

17:24.344 --> 17:26.813
I'm not leaving 'em behind.

17:26.846 --> 17:29.216
I need you to evacuate
in an orderly fashion!

17:29.249 --> 17:31.518
Quickly, this way, move, move!

17:31.551 --> 17:33.853
Everybody back behind
the barricades! Hurry!

17:33.886 --> 17:36.523
Lieutenant, NCIS.
What do we know?

17:36.556 --> 17:38.658
NCIS? Why are you here?

17:38.691 --> 17:40.627
We already have a man inside,
which is probably why

17:40.660 --> 17:42.162
it's so quiet
in there.

17:42.195 --> 17:43.730
Unless you know something
we don't.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.665
Witnesses say it's one shooter,
two or three hostages,

17:45.698 --> 17:46.833
and another one
trying to talk him down.

17:46.866 --> 17:48.368
That'd be McGee.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.737
Wait, wait.
We got this, Agents.

17:50.770 --> 17:53.373
One punk with a gun is nothing a
little shock and awe won't fix.

17:53.406 --> 17:56.143
Wait, wait, shock and awe?
This guy's no punk with a gun.

17:56.176 --> 17:57.377
He won't hesitate
to take others down

17:57.410 --> 17:59.146
the moment he feels threatened.

17:59.179 --> 17:59.979
So you know him?

18:00.012 --> 18:01.080
I know he's
an international felon,

18:01.114 --> 18:03.783
and I know he will leave
scorched earth in his wake.

18:03.816 --> 18:05.285
Got it?

18:08.288 --> 18:09.789
Do you want to fight me
for jurisdiction on this?

18:09.822 --> 18:12.392
All yours then.
We got your back.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.394
Pleasure.
Stand down and stand by
for further orders.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.563
Back behind the barricades!
Hurry up!

18:16.596 --> 18:17.797
You got to work
with me here, Andre.

18:17.830 --> 18:19.566
You know we're not
gonna have much luck

18:19.599 --> 18:21.601
getting a doctor
unless you put that gun away.

18:21.634 --> 18:24.137
Then I suggest you try harder.

18:24.171 --> 18:25.905
Okay.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.807
(groans)

18:27.840 --> 18:29.809
Please, let me go.

18:29.842 --> 18:31.911
Shut up, you stupid cow!

18:31.944 --> 18:35.148
Now then, I appreciate
you playing hero, my friend,

18:35.182 --> 18:38.285
but it will end badly.
I promise you that!

18:38.318 --> 18:41.688
(quietly): Did you hear that?
Time to put the weapons away.

18:41.721 --> 18:44.791
I wasn't kidding when I said as
soon as Yorka feels outgunned,

18:44.824 --> 18:46.293
he'll start shooting.
Believe me.

18:46.326 --> 18:47.860
So we just walk
in unarmed?

18:47.894 --> 18:50.263
No.

18:52.765 --> 18:54.601
Andre needs to feel
like he's in control.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.236
We got to try to win him over.

18:56.269 --> 18:57.870
Bishop, go back around
through the treatment room.

18:57.904 --> 18:59.939
Come out the other side.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.709
Sloane, go with her.
Stay out of sight.

19:02.742 --> 19:05.445
Why? You think I
can't control the urge

19:05.478 --> 19:07.180
to punch him in the face?
Well, yes.

19:07.214 --> 19:10.417
Right now, it's more important
you listen and advise...

19:11.484 --> 19:13.553
...than show all our cards
up front.

19:13.586 --> 19:17.890
Right. I keep forgetting you're
really good at what you do.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.594
GIBBS:
Don't shoot me.

19:25.898 --> 19:28.268
How's it going, McGee?

19:28.301 --> 19:30.270
Living a dream, boss.

19:32.772 --> 19:33.740
(door closes)

19:33.773 --> 19:35.375
Hey, McGee.
Hey.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.544
YORKA: Unless
you're both doctors,

19:37.577 --> 19:39.946
I don't recall inviting
either of you.

19:39.979 --> 19:41.348
No, we're not doctors.

19:42.949 --> 19:45.218
Unarmed. Here to help.

19:45.252 --> 19:46.185
McGEE: And the chances
of you getting

19:46.219 --> 19:48.888
what you need just
got a whole lot better.

19:48.921 --> 19:50.890
Especially if you
let me help him.
Not yet.

19:50.923 --> 19:52.892
First, we search.

19:52.925 --> 19:55.562
You, get back.
Get back!

19:55.595 --> 19:58.565
(whimpers)
Anyone moves...

19:58.598 --> 19:59.766
she dies.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.901
First her.

20:01.934 --> 20:05.338
Look. Look in the pockets
in the back!

20:06.973 --> 20:08.908
Unarmed.

20:08.941 --> 20:10.810
Indeed.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.812
Now, boss man, over here.

20:12.845 --> 20:13.980
You, move.

20:14.013 --> 20:15.648
Now him.

20:15.682 --> 20:17.450
Him! Go!

20:17.484 --> 20:19.619
Look.

20:19.652 --> 20:23.022
Pocket
in the back, look.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.824
(gun clatters)

20:30.330 --> 20:31.998
Keep searching.

20:35.902 --> 20:38.471
Impressive.

20:38.505 --> 20:40.307
Now the ankles.

20:40.340 --> 20:42.375
(Morgan groaning)

20:45.044 --> 20:47.380
(grunting)

20:49.616 --> 20:50.817
Go.

20:52.319 --> 20:55.288
Oh, he got me good.

20:55.322 --> 20:56.923
YORKA:
Get up!

20:58.891 --> 21:01.328
Now then...

21:01.361 --> 21:02.562
who are you, really?

21:02.595 --> 21:03.930
GIBBS:
NCIS.

21:03.963 --> 21:05.965
Gibbs and Bishop.

21:05.998 --> 21:08.435
We know what happened
this morning with MI5.

21:08.468 --> 21:10.603
In which case,
you know nothing.

21:10.637 --> 21:12.305
Maybe.

21:12.339 --> 21:14.907
So, you'll let these two go
in exchange for us?

21:16.042 --> 21:18.345
Sounds like a fair trade, right?

21:18.378 --> 21:20.046
I'll decide
what's fair, blondie.

21:20.079 --> 21:21.448
No one leaves here

21:21.481 --> 21:23.916
until this bullet
is out of my leg

21:23.950 --> 21:26.986
and I have a secure transport
out of the country.

21:27.019 --> 21:28.788
That first part
I can guarantee you.

21:28.821 --> 21:30.089
The second part--

21:30.122 --> 21:31.724
the transport out--

21:31.758 --> 21:33.326
it's gonna take some time.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.462
Then I suggest you try...

21:35.495 --> 21:36.929
(phone rings)

21:41.968 --> 21:43.603
(groans)

21:43.636 --> 21:46.806
How far would McGee go
to get you a grape soda?

21:46.839 --> 21:48.808
For me?
The ends of the earth.

21:48.841 --> 21:50.910
And whatever
that red light is...

21:50.943 --> 21:52.712
it's been blinking a while.

21:52.745 --> 21:54.681
And that can't
be good.

21:54.714 --> 21:57.083
(man speaking over bullhorn)

21:59.419 --> 22:00.987
Um...

22:01.020 --> 22:03.390
I'm sure that's nothing.

22:03.423 --> 22:05.425
And-and Tim--
wherever he is--

22:05.458 --> 22:07.394
I'm sure he's... fine.

22:07.427 --> 22:09.996
Totally fine. You know?

22:10.029 --> 22:12.031
Mm-hmm.
But I'm just gonna...
I'm gonna go check.

22:12.064 --> 22:14.867
Hmm.

22:14.901 --> 22:16.669
Let him go, fella.

22:16.703 --> 22:18.971
He's got two babies
coming upstairs.

22:21.140 --> 22:23.075
Is that right?

22:23.109 --> 22:25.077
Two babies?

22:25.111 --> 22:27.046
(groans)
GIBBS: McGee.

22:27.079 --> 22:28.415
What's he talking about?

22:28.448 --> 22:30.082
I don't know, boss.

22:30.116 --> 22:32.385
Uh, the guy's delirious,
he's losing blood.

22:32.419 --> 22:34.421
Enough!

22:34.454 --> 22:35.955
That makes you

22:35.988 --> 22:39.892
much more valuable, hero.

22:39.926 --> 22:43.029
The new daddy will
never meet his babies

22:43.062 --> 22:46.165
unless my demands
are met immediately!

22:46.198 --> 22:48.468
A doctor. Now!

23:07.186 --> 23:08.721
Look, I'm flying solo back there
with two critical patients

23:08.755 --> 23:12.124
I'm trying to get out of here.
Okay, well, where are
all the other doctors?

23:12.158 --> 23:14.627
The shooting started, they
ran out with the patients.

23:14.661 --> 23:17.096
I mean, the cops have this
entire wing sealed off,

23:17.129 --> 23:18.798
so getting in and out
is impossible.

23:18.831 --> 23:20.867
Let me see what I can do.
Thanks, Doctor.

23:20.900 --> 23:21.968
Yeah.
(phone vibrates)

23:22.001 --> 23:23.402
Hold on.

23:24.036 --> 23:25.905
Hey, Abbs, what's up?

23:25.938 --> 23:28.007
Have you heard from McGee?
He's not answering his phone

23:28.040 --> 23:29.876
and the hospital
won't let me go look for him.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.143
It's some kind of emergency

23:31.177 --> 23:32.912
or something.
Yeah, we know, and actually,

23:32.945 --> 23:34.747
McGee is here
in the E.R. with us.

23:34.781 --> 23:37.850
Us? W-What are you doing
in the E.R.?

23:37.884 --> 23:39.185
We need a doctor, Abbs.

23:39.218 --> 23:42.154
Oh, it's trouble?
I knew it.

23:42.188 --> 23:43.756
Is it McGee?
How bad is it?

23:43.790 --> 23:44.857
SLOANE:
It's hard to explain.

23:44.891 --> 23:46.826
Look.

23:52.799 --> 23:55.201
Okay, this is...

23:55.234 --> 23:57.770
way worse than I imagined.

23:57.804 --> 23:59.906
Yeah. We'll have them out soon.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.207
Hey, how's Delilah doing?

24:01.240 --> 24:02.909
Delilah is in labor!

24:02.942 --> 24:05.077
Like, major, major labor.

24:05.111 --> 24:06.045
What am I supposed to tell her?

24:06.078 --> 24:08.247
Honestly, why tell her
anything right now?

24:08.280 --> 24:09.616
(phone beeps)

24:09.649 --> 24:10.950
That's Torres calling, Abbs.

24:10.983 --> 24:12.885
Send a doctor if you
can. Got to go. Bye.

24:12.919 --> 24:14.787
Hey, Nick, what's up?

24:14.821 --> 24:16.055
Why is Gibbs
not answering his phone?

24:16.088 --> 24:17.724
SLOANE:
He's a little busy right now.

24:17.757 --> 24:19.058
Why, did you find something
in the hotel?

24:19.091 --> 24:20.192
You name it, we found it.

24:20.226 --> 24:21.628
Both men
were definitely here.

24:21.661 --> 24:23.730
And, uh, one of 'em had company.

24:23.763 --> 24:26.966
Along with bomb plans, parts,
and a train schedule.

24:26.999 --> 24:28.200
A train schedule?
REEVES: We've got Metro

24:28.234 --> 24:29.969
and Homeland on high alert,

24:30.002 --> 24:32.038
but until we figure out if the
train or the actual station

24:32.071 --> 24:34.240
is the target,
nothing gets shut down.

24:34.273 --> 24:35.575
Any chance the train was just

24:35.608 --> 24:36.843
their-their way
of getting around?

24:36.876 --> 24:39.779
Well, either way, you can add
"terrorist" to Yorka's résumé.

24:39.812 --> 24:41.013
I'm not so sure,
Nick; terrorists

24:41.047 --> 24:42.749
are driven by
their beliefs.

24:42.782 --> 24:43.950
Yorka only believes in himself.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.685
He is spiteful and petty.

24:45.718 --> 24:47.554
It has to be something
more personal than that.

24:47.587 --> 24:49.021
Personal, as in
a particular person

24:49.055 --> 24:50.723
riding one of those trains?

24:50.757 --> 24:52.559
SLOANE:
Find out who that is, you guys.

24:52.592 --> 24:53.860
It might narrow
down your search.

24:53.893 --> 24:54.961
I don't suppose
you could persuade Yorka

24:54.994 --> 24:56.729
to tell us where to look?

24:56.763 --> 24:58.931
Yeah, well, I'd say
we're a long way from that.

24:58.965 --> 25:01.601
Got to go.

25:01.634 --> 25:05.237
But if it's time to turn up
the heat, we might as well try.

25:05.271 --> 25:07.139
You good to go?

25:07.173 --> 25:08.741
Yeah, I'm good.
Good.

25:10.943 --> 25:12.745
I got you.
Okay.

25:16.749 --> 25:18.551
Where the hell's my doctor?

25:18.585 --> 25:20.620
Where the hell's
your bomb?

25:20.653 --> 25:22.021
What?
What?

25:22.054 --> 25:24.624
Our agents found bomb plans
and a train schedule

25:24.657 --> 25:27.026
at your hotel room.
My hotel room?

25:27.059 --> 25:29.061
Bishop, are you nuts?

25:31.731 --> 25:33.933
You're just gonna admit all that
right in front of this guy?

25:33.966 --> 25:35.067
Lose every bit of leverage

25:35.101 --> 25:36.936
we did have?

25:36.969 --> 25:38.137
SLOANE (quietly):
I knew you'd get it.

25:39.739 --> 25:41.808
Okay, I'm sorry, Gibbs.

25:41.841 --> 25:43.943
You're sorry?!

25:43.976 --> 25:45.845
Geez.

25:49.315 --> 25:50.983
Women.

25:51.017 --> 25:53.152
They do like to talk,
don't they?

25:53.185 --> 25:55.021
Attaboy, Gibbs.

25:55.054 --> 25:56.823
You got us over
a barrel, Andre.

25:56.856 --> 25:58.791
Then get me a damn doctor.

25:58.825 --> 26:00.026
We will.

26:00.059 --> 26:02.328
Soon.

26:02.361 --> 26:04.330
Soon as you tell us
where the bomb is.

26:04.363 --> 26:05.698
Again,

26:05.732 --> 26:07.166
you have it backward.

26:07.199 --> 26:09.168
Nothing happens
until I'm patched up

26:09.201 --> 26:10.837
and out of here.

26:10.870 --> 26:12.705
And, as you now know...

26:13.873 --> 26:15.608
...the clock is ticking.

26:17.043 --> 26:18.845
So go!

26:25.417 --> 26:27.920
Hey!

26:27.954 --> 26:29.021
All good.

26:29.055 --> 26:29.989
McGee's just...

26:30.022 --> 26:31.991
pacing around down there.

26:32.024 --> 26:33.760
Sure he'll be up
here really soon.

26:33.793 --> 26:36.162
Oh. Well, I won't
hold my breath. (chuckles)

26:36.195 --> 26:37.697
But nice try, though.

26:37.730 --> 26:39.098
ABBY:
Um...

26:41.834 --> 26:44.070
Um...

26:44.103 --> 26:46.072
he's...

26:46.105 --> 26:48.207
not all that involved, so...

26:48.240 --> 26:49.976
Just right in the middle of it?

26:50.009 --> 26:51.911
Like, directly,
right in the middle of it, yes.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.045
That's what I was afrai...

26:53.079 --> 26:54.681
Ow! Ow.

26:54.714 --> 26:57.016
(pants, exhales)

26:57.049 --> 26:58.751
Ooh! Ow.

26:58.785 --> 27:01.420
What do you mean you can't
get a doctor in here?

27:01.453 --> 27:04.223
Don't tell me to sit
tight, you try harder.

27:04.256 --> 27:05.825
"Sit tight."

27:05.858 --> 27:07.960
Hey, Gibbs.
Could it be that hard?

27:09.295 --> 27:10.963
You can pull this off.

27:10.997 --> 27:12.799
I'd sure enjoy
the hell out of trying.

27:12.832 --> 27:14.300
Don't enjoy it too much.

27:14.333 --> 27:16.235
Shot of morphine'd do the trick.
They don't leave that

27:16.268 --> 27:18.070
lying around here, do they?
No, they don't.

27:19.471 --> 27:22.241
Ah. But enough ketamine
will make him pretty sleepy.

27:22.274 --> 27:23.876
Yeah, great. Go, Doc.

27:23.910 --> 27:25.712
Get suited up.

27:26.979 --> 27:29.015
Nothing to tell us
where it is. Any luck?

27:29.048 --> 27:30.182
Nothing to do with bombs
or trains,

27:30.216 --> 27:31.851
but this is fairly interesting.

27:31.884 --> 27:32.952
You hacked Viktor?

27:32.985 --> 27:34.954
Was there ever a doubt?

27:34.987 --> 27:36.255
In his business folder,
there is an order

27:36.288 --> 27:38.357
for frozen Maryland crab cakes

27:38.390 --> 27:40.793
placed by the International
Coalition for Peace.

27:40.827 --> 27:43.362
Ugh. Who would eat
frozen crab cakes?

27:43.395 --> 27:45.765
Anyway, I looked up this group,
and it's a consortium

27:45.798 --> 27:47.333
of dignitaries
from all over the world--

27:47.366 --> 27:49.035
France, Belgium, Romania,

27:49.068 --> 27:50.803
Croatia, Italy.

27:50.837 --> 27:52.104
Wait, hold on-- Romania.
Didn't Romania

27:52.138 --> 27:54.273
freeze Yorka's assets last year?

27:54.306 --> 27:55.808
Sloane said it was personal.

27:55.842 --> 27:57.043
Where were
these crab cakes going?

27:57.076 --> 27:58.110
REEVES:
Here it is.

27:58.144 --> 27:59.145
Delivery invoice.

27:59.178 --> 28:00.346
Scheduled for this morning.

28:00.379 --> 28:01.413
They delivered this morning?

28:01.447 --> 28:02.448
3:30 a.m.

28:02.481 --> 28:04.717
for a pre-Thanksgiving brunch

28:04.751 --> 28:07.119
hosted in the main ballroom
of the Westcott Hotel.

28:07.153 --> 28:09.088
Reeves, that's here.
And brunch starts
in five minutes.

28:09.121 --> 28:11.457
I'm calling Homeland.
I'll call hotel security.

28:11.490 --> 28:13.092
MORGAN:
I'm sorry, kid.

28:13.125 --> 28:15.795
I'm really sorry.

28:15.828 --> 28:17.063
Morgan, don't be sorry.
Just hang on, okay?

28:17.096 --> 28:18.297
We're gonna get you
out of here.

28:18.330 --> 28:20.099
One way or another.

28:23.069 --> 28:25.304
All right, found you a doctor.
YORKA: Finally.

28:30.076 --> 28:32.812
What took so long, sweetie?

28:32.845 --> 28:34.814
Powdering your nose?

28:34.847 --> 28:36.282
Something like that.

28:36.315 --> 28:38.751
Hey, she's here
to save your sorry ass.

28:38.785 --> 28:40.286
Let everyone else go.

28:40.319 --> 28:42.521
Stop telling me what to do.
McGEE: Look, just let Morgan go,

28:42.554 --> 28:44.824
okay? He's bleeding out.

28:44.857 --> 28:46.893
Stop telling me what to do!

28:48.094 --> 28:49.461
Now, I've waited
long enough!

28:49.495 --> 28:52.064
Let's get on with it!

28:54.967 --> 28:57.136
Security's meeting us
down there.

28:57.169 --> 28:59.071
Well, at least
you got a person.

28:59.105 --> 29:01.507
All I get from Homeland
was a recording.

29:01.540 --> 29:03.509
(phone chimes)
Oh, great.

29:03.542 --> 29:05.544
Now Metro PD sends the
crime scene surveillance?

29:05.577 --> 29:07.246
A little late
for that.

29:07.279 --> 29:08.547
Is it?

29:08.580 --> 29:10.049
Seriously?
There could a bomb downstairs

29:10.082 --> 29:11.317
and you're worried
about a crime scene?

29:11.350 --> 29:12.384
You're right. Let's
just stand here,

29:12.418 --> 29:15.487
waiting for the lift to open,
patiently, shall we?

29:15.521 --> 29:17.957
Here. Watch it.

29:17.990 --> 29:20.392
All right, see?
He kills Ford.

29:20.426 --> 29:22.061
Then he turns around.

29:22.094 --> 29:24.530
And bang, he kills Viktor.

29:24.563 --> 29:27.133
See that? Blood trail.
No surprises.

29:28.567 --> 29:30.136
REEVES: Getaway car
is actually a van

29:30.169 --> 29:32.338
from Viktor's
food company.

29:32.371 --> 29:34.373
Wait a minute.

29:34.406 --> 29:36.208
There's a third person.

29:36.242 --> 29:38.845
What?
Yorka had a driver.

29:41.180 --> 29:42.982
No.

29:43.015 --> 29:45.084
No? It's just a local, sir.

29:45.117 --> 29:46.886
No, no painkillers.

29:46.919 --> 29:48.254
No tricks.

29:50.156 --> 29:52.291
It's gonna hurt
like hell.

29:52.324 --> 29:53.926
Pain I can handle.

29:55.227 --> 29:56.228
Don't worry.

29:56.262 --> 29:58.397
We'll see about that.
Excuse me?

30:00.299 --> 30:04.403
We'll see what's going on after
I cut your pant leg open.

30:04.436 --> 30:06.272
Ooh.

30:06.305 --> 30:08.274
(inhales sharply)
Wow.

30:08.307 --> 30:10.843
Oh, you new at this, Doctor?

30:10.877 --> 30:12.444
With a gun pointed
at my head, yeah.

30:12.478 --> 30:14.246
Oh.

30:20.252 --> 30:22.288
(Yorka groans)

30:24.290 --> 30:26.192
I wouldn't...

30:27.259 --> 30:29.461
...if I were you.

30:29.495 --> 30:33.199
You didn't think I'd come here
alone, did you?

30:45.577 --> 30:47.880
Damn it. Easy.

30:47.914 --> 30:49.515
Scissors could be sharper.

30:49.548 --> 30:51.183
I could look for better ones.

30:51.217 --> 30:53.052
No, it's okay.

30:53.085 --> 30:54.320
NICOLE:
Hurry up, would you?

30:54.353 --> 30:56.422
I never signed up
for this, Andre.

30:56.455 --> 30:58.390
I know, my pet, but here we are.

31:00.059 --> 31:02.061
(groans)

31:04.463 --> 31:06.365
(groans, whimpers)

31:06.398 --> 31:09.001
He'll get here, Delilah,
you know he will.

31:09.035 --> 31:10.502
What if he doesn't?

31:10.536 --> 31:12.171
McGee's been through
way worse than this.

31:12.204 --> 31:13.472
He will be here.

31:13.505 --> 31:15.374
Just... just hang on.

31:15.407 --> 31:17.276
Oh, I can hang on.
It's these two I'm not...

31:17.309 --> 31:19.011
so sure abou-- ow!

31:19.045 --> 31:21.247
(groaning):
Ow, ow!

31:21.280 --> 31:23.282
(growls)

31:23.315 --> 31:25.184
(Yorka growling)

31:25.217 --> 31:27.386
(groans)

31:27.419 --> 31:31.357
Maybe it would be easier if we
just took your pants off.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.425
You're not taking my pants off.

31:33.459 --> 31:35.361
I'm a doctor.
I've seen them all.

31:36.462 --> 31:39.198
Just keep cutting.

31:39.231 --> 31:41.467
We've all got our
shortcomings, don't we?

31:41.500 --> 31:43.335
What did you say?
Nothing.

31:43.369 --> 31:46.105
No shortcomings here,
believe me!

31:46.138 --> 31:47.673
Now just keep cutting!

31:47.706 --> 31:49.175
SLOANE:
Okay.

31:49.208 --> 31:50.276
(groans)

31:50.309 --> 31:51.577
All right.

31:51.610 --> 31:53.412
McGee, get him out of here.

31:53.445 --> 31:55.214
Okay, come on,
let's go, come on.

31:55.247 --> 31:57.483
No. No!

31:57.516 --> 31:59.051
Just let him go, Andre.

31:59.085 --> 32:01.620
All right, legs up. Come on,
let's get you out of here.

32:01.653 --> 32:03.355
We have to get
out of here!

32:03.389 --> 32:05.391
(groaning):
You be quiet.

32:09.195 --> 32:11.230
Bishop, you, too, go.

32:11.263 --> 32:13.966
No, Gibbs, I'm good.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.501
(Yorka groans)

32:19.038 --> 32:21.173
(Sloane grunts)

32:21.207 --> 32:23.509
(Yorka groans)

32:23.542 --> 32:26.645
Ooh. That's not so good.

32:26.678 --> 32:29.215
Just get it out of there.

32:29.248 --> 32:32.484
Bishop, Yorka had a second
accomplice. Call me back.

32:34.386 --> 32:35.754
NCIS, hey.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.323
Dave Barbado,
hotel security.

32:37.356 --> 32:39.325
Rest of my team
should be here shortly.

32:39.358 --> 32:40.592
Shortly? We don't
have shortly.

32:40.626 --> 32:42.061
Where is Romania sitting?

32:42.094 --> 32:43.562
Romania? Guys, take it easy.

32:43.595 --> 32:45.164
There's no bomb.

32:45.197 --> 32:46.432
And how do you know that?

32:46.465 --> 32:48.067
With this guest list?
Homeland had a team

32:48.100 --> 32:49.535
comb this place this morning.

32:49.568 --> 32:50.736
Well, don't mind if we
check ourselves.

32:55.207 --> 32:58.110
Hang in there, Morgan. Hello!

32:58.144 --> 32:59.745
Help, Doctor. I need
help, Doctor, please.

32:59.778 --> 33:00.779
He's been shot.

33:00.812 --> 33:02.248
Sir. Here, look at me.

33:02.281 --> 33:03.715
Can you hear me?

33:03.749 --> 33:05.617
Yeah, yeah.
McGEE: He lost a lot of blood.

33:05.651 --> 33:07.186
Okay. Uh, just stay
with him for a minute.

33:07.219 --> 33:09.021
I'll be back
with more hands.

33:09.055 --> 33:11.190
Everyone okay?
You get him?

33:11.223 --> 33:13.292
We got him, Morgan, we got him.
MORGAN: Yeah.

33:13.325 --> 33:14.793
All of us.

33:14.826 --> 33:17.196
You...

33:17.229 --> 33:20.166
everything you got going on,
you never left me.

33:21.300 --> 33:22.768
Thank you.

33:24.570 --> 33:27.473
Anything for a fellow
law enforcement officer.

33:27.506 --> 33:30.376
(laughs)

33:30.409 --> 33:32.811
Y-You go now...

33:32.844 --> 33:35.481
you be a great daddy.

33:35.514 --> 33:37.083
I will.

33:37.116 --> 33:39.618
And, Morgan, thank you.

33:41.087 --> 33:42.654
Morgan?

33:44.523 --> 33:47.393
Morgan.

33:57.703 --> 33:59.605
(screaming)

34:03.609 --> 34:07.446
Sure I can't give you something
for the pain?

34:07.479 --> 34:08.614
(Yorka groaning)

34:08.647 --> 34:11.483
No. Just hurry!
Get it out.

34:11.517 --> 34:13.519
Ow! Ow!

34:13.552 --> 34:14.620
You got this, okay?

34:14.653 --> 34:16.122
You can do it.

34:16.155 --> 34:17.623
I-It's all, it's all about
your babies now.

34:17.656 --> 34:19.525
Damn straight it is.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.560
DELILAH: Tim, hi.
Hey, hey, I'm here.

34:21.593 --> 34:23.662
Hi.
Hey, baby.

34:23.695 --> 34:24.596
Okay.

34:24.630 --> 34:26.498
I hear it's time to push.

34:26.532 --> 34:28.134
Oh, it's way past time.

34:28.167 --> 34:30.602
(inhales)
Ooh, let's go.

34:30.636 --> 34:32.538
(exhales, cries)

34:32.571 --> 34:33.572
Excuse me.
Sorry, sorry.

34:33.605 --> 34:34.706
Gentlemen, I'm so sorry.

34:37.743 --> 34:39.178
Excuse me, excuse me.

34:39.211 --> 34:40.679
Guys, come on.

34:40.712 --> 34:41.847
There's no bomb.

34:43.849 --> 34:47.719
Eh, there's-there's
no bomb, folks!

34:47.753 --> 34:50.722
Knock yourselves out,
guys. This is on you.

34:50.756 --> 34:53.091
This entire room has been
triple checked.

34:54.893 --> 34:57.496
The entire room?

34:57.529 --> 35:00.499
Just this room?
TORRES: What about the kitchen?

35:00.532 --> 35:02.701
Ho-ho-hold it,
hold it, hold it.

35:04.736 --> 35:07.606
Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy.
If there is something, let's be

35:07.639 --> 35:08.740
a little bit more gentler,
shall we?

35:08.774 --> 35:10.442
All right, well,
there's nothing here.

35:11.743 --> 35:13.645
There's nothing under mine.

35:16.882 --> 35:18.850
(beeping)

35:20.686 --> 35:22.454
Out! Out! Everybody out!
Everybody out!
Get out!

35:22.488 --> 35:24.356
Ladies and gentlemen,
the exit's to the south.

35:24.390 --> 35:25.591
Please move to the exits.
Get out of the room!

35:25.624 --> 35:26.725
Stay calm.
REEVES: Out! Out! Everybody out!

35:26.758 --> 35:28.427
Out! Evacuate!

35:28.460 --> 35:31.530
(groans, screams)

35:31.563 --> 35:33.665
Keep it up, Dee,
you're doing great.

35:33.699 --> 35:35.634
Give us another big push.
(Delilah groans, screams)

35:39.405 --> 35:41.707
(Yorka groaning)

35:41.740 --> 35:43.141
(Yorka screaming)

35:46.978 --> 35:48.714
(gasps)

35:48.747 --> 35:51.250
SLOANE:
(grunts) Ah.

35:52.951 --> 35:54.686
Got it.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.722
(Yorka groans)

35:59.858 --> 36:00.859
That is a bomb, right?

36:00.892 --> 36:03.495
Well, it's got to be.

36:03.529 --> 36:05.464
That's a brick of C-4,
or clay, maybe.

36:05.497 --> 36:06.698
Clay? Why would it be clay?

36:06.732 --> 36:08.567
Who sticks wires
and a motor in clay?

36:08.600 --> 36:10.469
I don't know. Then it's C-4,
but shouldn't there be a timer?

36:10.502 --> 36:12.070
There's always a timer
in the movies.

36:12.103 --> 36:14.773
There's no timer,
but it's definitely ticking.
REEVES: It's absolutely ticking.

36:14.806 --> 36:16.242
So what now?

36:16.275 --> 36:17.676
I don't know.
Call the bomb squad?

36:17.709 --> 36:18.777
What if there's no time?

36:18.810 --> 36:20.312
How would you know
if there's no timer?

36:20.346 --> 36:22.248
Well, good point, but what now?

36:22.281 --> 36:23.882
We cut the wires?

36:23.915 --> 36:25.551
Okay, well, there's a red one
and a yellow one.

36:25.584 --> 36:26.718
Which one do they cut
in the movies?

36:26.752 --> 36:29.421
This is not a movie.
Yellow.

36:29.455 --> 36:30.822
Always yellow.
Okay.

36:30.856 --> 36:32.891
No, wait.
What?

36:34.360 --> 36:35.827
Wait-- no. You know what? Red.

36:35.861 --> 36:36.962
Definitely red.

36:36.995 --> 36:38.797
Okay. Yeah. Maybe.

36:38.830 --> 36:40.499
How about both?

36:40.532 --> 36:41.567
And then we run like hell.

36:41.600 --> 36:42.601
I like that plan.

36:42.634 --> 36:43.869
Okay. Wait.
What?

36:43.902 --> 36:44.936
The ticking's
getting louder.

36:44.970 --> 36:46.505
And faster.
Do it.

36:49.608 --> 36:51.543
(powering down)

36:57.015 --> 36:58.784
You know, you can
put that away now.

36:58.817 --> 37:00.352
Why would I do that?

37:00.386 --> 37:02.721
We still have my transport
to discuss.

37:02.754 --> 37:03.922
Our transport.

37:03.955 --> 37:05.657
Yes, baby, our...

37:05.691 --> 37:07.826
transport, of course.

37:07.859 --> 37:08.727
(phone rings)

37:08.760 --> 37:10.796
Well, there's your
transport, right there.

37:10.829 --> 37:11.863
Answer it.

37:14.466 --> 37:15.634
(phone beeps)

37:15.667 --> 37:17.503
Yeah, Torres.

37:17.536 --> 37:18.637
TORRES:
We got the bomb, Gibbs.

37:18.670 --> 37:21.773
And we shut it right down.
GIBBS: (laughs) That right?

37:21.807 --> 37:23.875
Yeah, man.
Just like in the movies.

37:23.909 --> 37:25.644
Ooh, you'd be so proud.

37:30.015 --> 37:32.651
Is what right?
What did they say?

37:32.684 --> 37:34.753
Your bomb is a goner.

37:36.054 --> 37:37.456
Andre,

37:37.489 --> 37:38.990
we don't need you anymore.
What?

37:39.024 --> 37:41.793
He said you're finished.

37:41.827 --> 37:42.894
(Yorka screams)

37:44.863 --> 37:46.832
Andre!

37:48.467 --> 37:50.402
(Sloane yelling)

37:50.436 --> 37:52.404
GIBBS: You got him.
You got him.

37:52.438 --> 37:53.639
You got him. Whoa.

37:53.672 --> 37:56.007
That man, that man you killed?
Hey, hey.

37:56.041 --> 37:57.809
He was a good man!
Sloane.

37:57.843 --> 38:01.079
He was a... he was my friend.

38:01.112 --> 38:04.750
(coughs)

38:04.783 --> 38:07.319
He was my friend.

38:09.821 --> 38:11.557
They're perfect, Dee.

38:11.590 --> 38:12.891
They're perfect.

38:12.924 --> 38:15.594
I still can't believe it.

38:15.627 --> 38:16.662
Hey.

38:16.695 --> 38:18.630
So, the news says

38:18.664 --> 38:20.666
it's over.
We got the bad guys.

38:20.699 --> 38:21.800
Oh, thank God.

38:21.833 --> 38:22.768
Anyone else hurt?

38:22.801 --> 38:24.436
Nope.

38:24.470 --> 38:26.405
Not that I know of.

38:26.438 --> 38:28.440
So I'm gonna,
um, go down.

38:28.474 --> 38:30.442
Uh, do you want
a grape soda?

38:30.476 --> 38:31.943
And can I send the gang up?

38:31.977 --> 38:33.078
No to the soda.

38:33.111 --> 38:34.846
Yes to the gang,
if they're up for it.

38:34.880 --> 38:36.715
ABBY:
This is only, like,

38:36.748 --> 38:38.984
the best Thanksgiving ever.

38:39.017 --> 38:40.819
(chuckles)

38:40.852 --> 38:42.388
Just saying.

38:43.889 --> 38:45.557
Hey, little buddy.

38:45.591 --> 38:47.359
Hey, it's Mommy.

38:48.894 --> 38:50.829
I guess it's name time.

38:50.862 --> 38:53.832
Yeah, I've been rethinking
those, uh, Star Wars names.

38:53.865 --> 38:55.501
Mm.

38:55.534 --> 38:57.736
How about John?

38:57.769 --> 38:59.871
After your dad.

39:03.108 --> 39:05.444
John McGee.

39:07.012 --> 39:09.515
Johnny, meet your sister.

39:09.548 --> 39:11.550
Your sister.

39:11.583 --> 39:14.420
Your sister...?

39:14.453 --> 39:16.522
We got it narrowed down to six.

39:16.555 --> 39:17.856
Can I add a seventh?

39:17.889 --> 39:18.857
Oh, seriously?

39:18.890 --> 39:20.926
How do you feel about...

39:20.959 --> 39:23.161
What?
Morgan?

39:23.194 --> 39:25.897
Morgan McGee?

39:25.931 --> 39:27.833
Mmm.

39:27.866 --> 39:29.801
Johnny and Morgan.

39:29.835 --> 39:32.938
Yeah. Yeah, that
sounds right.

39:38.944 --> 39:40.946
Hi.

39:42.047 --> 39:45.617
That's a pretty picture.
