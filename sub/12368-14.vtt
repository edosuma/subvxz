01:40.809 --> 01:43.186
OH, MY GOD.

COMEDIES NEVER WIN
BEST PICTURE.

01:46.105 --> 01:47.982
OKAY, I NEED TO SUBMIT
A NEW STORY.

01:48.066 --> 01:51.861
SOMETHING THAT EXPOSES
THE DARK TRUTH ABOUT SOCIETY.

01:51.945 --> 01:56.032
SOMETHING THAT MAKES PEOPLE
ASHAMED TO BE HUMAN.

01:56.115 --> 01:57.700
- WHY BOTHER, VICTORIA?

01:57.784 --> 01:59.661
I'VE ALREADY GOT A RIVETING
EXPOSE IN THE WORKS

01:59.744 --> 02:01.871
THAT'S GUARANTEED TO WIN.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.374

{\an8}- NOTE THAT I WEAR
A COWL NECK,

02:36.447 --> 02:38.533
{\an8}THE OFFICIAL SWEATER
OF THE OBESE.

02:43.162 --> 02:46.749
{\an8}YES, AS A METHOD ACTRESS,
I REALLY SWEAT THE DETAILS.

02:46.833 --> 02:49.544
{\an8}IN FACT,
I'M REALLY SWEATING NOW.

02:49.627 --> 02:53.590
{\an8}- YOU KNOW WHO'S A TERRIFIC
BIG-BONED ACTRESS?

02:53.673 --> 02:58.261
{\an8}UM, THE GAL FROM <i> NORBIT.</i>

02:58.344 --> 03:02.390
{\an8}- THAT WAS EDDIE MURPHY
PLAYING HIS OWN FAT WIFE.

03:02.473 --> 03:04.183
{\an8}- THAT WAS EDDIE?
- YEAH.

03:04.267 --> 03:07.395
{\an8}- OH, I'M GONNA NEED
A MINUTE HERE.

03:07.478 --> 03:09.772

OVEREATERS ANONYMOUS MEETING

03:12.650 --> 03:14.402

{\an8}I'M GONNA SEE IF I CAN PASS
FOR ONE OF THEM.

03:16.195 --> 03:18.489
{\an8}I'LL BE LIKE JANE GOODALL.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.786
{\an8}- JANE GOODALL DIDN'T DRESS UP
LIKE A CHIMP.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.955
{\an8}- NO, BUT I WAS
AT A HALLOWEEN PARTY ONCE

03:26.039 --> 03:28.791

03:28.875 --> 03:30.168

{\an8}MIGHT BE A NICE PLACE
TO MEET MEN.

03:33.713 --> 03:35.131
{\an8}- MEN WHO WANT
TO IMPROVE THEMSELVES.

03:35.214 --> 03:37.759
{\an8}THE RAREST TYPE OF MAN.

03:37.842 --> 03:41.846
{\an8}- ELKA?

03:43.556 --> 03:46.184
I'M GONNA NEED YOU
AT THAT MEETING WITH ME TONIGHT.

03:46.267 --> 03:49.145
NOW THIS IS A HIDDEN CAMERA,
AND I WANT YOU TO FILM ME

03:49.228 --> 03:51.522
AND THE OTHER HIGH-FRUCTOSE
AMERICANS

03:51.606 --> 03:54.984
AS WE...POUR OUR OVERWORKED
LITTLE HEARTS OUT.

03:55.068 --> 04:00.114
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO SHOW ME.
I'VE WORN A WIRE BEFORE.

04:00.198 --> 04:03.159
I'M GONNA NEED
A SURVEILLANCE VAN,

04:03.242 --> 04:08.081
A LOADED .22,
AND AN AIRTIGHT BACKSTORY.

04:09.707 --> 04:12.794
- NO VAN, NO GUN,
YOU USED TO BE FAT.

04:12.877 --> 04:17.298
- I THOUGHT FAT PEOPLE
WERE SUPPOSED TO BE FUN.

04:24.472 --> 04:26.224
- LET'S GO.
- OKAY, I'LL MEET YOU THERE.

04:26.307 --> 04:27.725
I WANNA GRAB SOME SNACKS
OUT OF THIS ROOM.

04:27.809 --> 04:29.477
- PIGGY, PIGGY.
- HEY!

04:29.560 --> 04:31.729
I SKIPPED LUNCH TODAY
SO I COULD FIT IN THESE PANTS.

04:31.813 --> 04:35.149
NOW THEY'VE LOOSENED UP.

04:35.233 --> 04:37.735
- HI.
- HI.

04:37.819 --> 04:39.320
- I'M SAM J.

04:39.404 --> 04:42.365
- OH, MELANIE MORE--
- OH, NO LAST NAMES HERE.

04:42.448 --> 04:44.409
- OH, OH.

04:44.492 --> 04:47.203
SO I GUESS THERE WON'T BE
ANY WINE WITH THIS CHEESE.

04:47.286 --> 04:49.372
- NO, NO LIQUOR, I'M AFRAID.
- MM.

04:49.455 --> 04:50.665
- THIS YOUR FIRST MEETING,
MELANIE?

04:50.748 --> 04:52.709
- YEAH...NO.

04:52.792 --> 04:54.669
I'M SUPPOSED TO MEET SOMEONE.

04:54.752 --> 04:55.878
- I'D SAY YOU JUST DID.

04:55.962 --> 04:58.381
- DID I?

04:58.464 --> 05:00.550
- WOW, THAT'S A GREAT SMILE.
- OH, THANK YOU.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.135
I USE BLEACHING STRIPS.

05:02.218 --> 05:05.346
WHY DO I SAY THINGS
LIKE THAT.

05:05.430 --> 05:08.224
- BECAUSE YOU'RE CUTE.

05:08.307 --> 05:10.184
COME ON, COME SIT NEXT TO ME.

05:10.268 --> 05:14.063
- SIT NEXT-- OH, I'M--
REALLY, I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO BE--

05:14.147 --> 05:17.191
I REALLY SHOULDN'T BE--
- PLEASE STAY.

05:17.275 --> 05:19.027
THE FIRST STEP
IS ALWAYS THE HARDEST.

05:19.110 --> 05:22.864
BUT ONE DAY AT A TIME.

05:22.947 --> 05:25.742
OKAY, GUYS, IF WE COULD ALL
TAKE OUR SEATS.

05:25.825 --> 05:29.120
GREAT, THANK YOU.

05:29.203 --> 05:32.415
AND...WELCOME, EVERYBODY,
TO SEXAHOLICS ANONYMOUS.

05:45.511 --> 05:47.388
- OF COURSE, THAT WAS

05:47.472 --> 05:52.226
BEFORE I LOST
600 POUNDS.

05:54.353 --> 05:56.147
- ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH.
IT'S MY TURN.

05:56.230 --> 05:58.816
- OH, ELKA, IF IT'S NOT
TOO TRAUMATIC,

05:58.900 --> 06:03.613
WOULD YOU MIND SHARING
YOUR ROCK BOTTOM?

06:03.696 --> 06:07.950
- IT WAS JULY, 2009.

06:08.034 --> 06:12.955
I FOUND A WHOLE
CHRISTMAS HAM...

06:13.039 --> 06:18.961
IN THE FOLDS OF MY BACK FAT.

06:19.045 --> 06:24.425
BY THEN IT WAS SMOKED.

06:24.509 --> 06:27.762
SO I ATE IT.

06:27.845 --> 06:30.181
- OH, WE FEEL YOUR PAIN.

06:30.264 --> 06:32.308
BUT WE ARE OUT OF TIME.

06:32.391 --> 06:34.102
SO...UNTIL THE NEXT MEETING.

06:34.185 --> 06:36.437
- BUT WAIT, WAIT,
I NEVER GOT TO SPEAK!

06:36.521 --> 06:39.816
BUT--

06:39.899 --> 06:42.819
- NEED A HOIST?
- OH.

06:44.737 --> 06:47.532
- I'M CHUCK.
- CHUNK?

06:47.615 --> 06:50.159
- CHUCK.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.994
I COULDN'T HELP NOTICING YOU
IN THE MEETING.

06:52.078 --> 06:54.622
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO GRAB A COFFEE SOMETIME?

06:54.705 --> 06:57.166
- [chuckling]

06:57.250 --> 06:59.043
OH, OH, YOU'RE SERIOUS.

06:59.127 --> 07:00.378
OH, NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

07:00.461 --> 07:02.797
GOD, NO.
YOU'RE NOT MY TYPE.

07:02.880 --> 07:04.674
UH, PHYSICALLY.

07:04.757 --> 07:07.718
- SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS
YOU'RE DISGUSTED BY FAT PEOPLE.

07:07.802 --> 07:12.014
- CHUCK, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
JUST SHOP YOUR...

07:12.098 --> 07:14.350
CONSIDERABLE WARES
ELSEWHERE.

07:14.433 --> 07:18.146
PERHAPS THAT LITTLE
BUTTERBALL OVER THERE.

07:18.229 --> 07:20.064
GALS THAT BIG REALLY
CAN'T AFFORD

07:20.148 --> 07:22.692
TO BE IN THE "NO" BUSINESS
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

07:22.775 --> 07:25.570
- OKAY, I GET IT.
YOU'RE NOT INTO ME.

07:25.653 --> 07:26.946
- JUST--

07:36.455 --> 07:40.501
- HEY!
IT'S COLIN COOPER!

07:40.585 --> 07:42.545
I'VE GOT ALL THE FOOTAGE
I NEED--TONS OF IT!

07:42.628 --> 07:44.088
PUN INTENDED.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.884
GOTTA GO!

07:50.803 --> 07:53.055
- EXCUSE ME.
I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEONE.

07:53.139 --> 07:54.724
HAVE YOU SEEN A PRETTY BRUNETTE
AROUND HERE?

07:54.807 --> 07:56.642
- I'M LOOKING AT ONE
RIGHT NOW.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.730
- I'M JOY.
- CHUCK.

08:00.813 --> 08:02.857
- HAVE WE MET BEFORE?

08:02.940 --> 08:05.276
- OH, I DON'T THINK SO.

08:05.359 --> 08:08.362
PRETTY SURE I WOULD'VE
REMEMBERED YOU.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.908
- NOW, HOW ABOUT SOMETHING
FROM OUR NEWEST MEMBER?

08:11.991 --> 08:14.076
- ME?

08:14.160 --> 08:17.205
- YOU'RE SAFE HERE.

08:18.289 --> 08:20.708
- HI, I'M MELANIE...

08:20.791 --> 08:23.544
AND I'M A...

08:23.628 --> 08:26.380
SEXAHOLIC.

08:26.464 --> 08:27.715
all: HI, MELANIE.

08:27.798 --> 08:29.759
- I CAN'T DO THIS, SAM.

08:29.842 --> 08:32.595
- LOOK, SOMETIMES IT'S BEST
TO JUST PUT IT ALL OUT THERE.

08:32.678 --> 08:34.429
START WITH YOUR ROCK BOTTOM--

08:34.514 --> 08:37.933
THE DAY YOU KNEW YOU WERE
A SLAVE TO YOUR SEXUAL DESIRES.

08:38.017 --> 08:42.480
- UM...OKAY,
THERE WAS, UM...

08:42.563 --> 08:44.941
THERE WAS
THIS ONE TIME

08:45.024 --> 08:49.946
I GOT LOST
IN A WOODED AREA.

08:50.029 --> 08:54.283
AND THESE SEVEN GUYS
FOUND ME.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.452
AND THEY BROUGHT ME BACK
TO THEIR COTTAGE,

08:56.535 --> 08:59.163
AND THEY MADE ME
COOK AND CLEAN FOR THEM.

08:59.247 --> 09:03.084
I THINK THEY WERE MINERS.
- MINERS?

09:03.167 --> 09:05.336
- OH, NO!
NOT THE YOUNG KIND OF MINORS.

09:05.419 --> 09:08.005
NO, THE--YOU KNOW,
WITH THE PICK AXES, MINERS.

09:10.258 --> 09:13.928
ANYWAY, I THINK I HAD
A BAD APPLE...TINI...

09:14.011 --> 09:18.683
AND, UM, BEFORE KNEW IT,
I WAS LYING ACROSS

09:18.766 --> 09:20.476
THESE TINY LITTLE BEDS

09:20.559 --> 09:22.520
AND ALL THE MINERS
WERE STANDING OVER ME,

09:22.603 --> 09:25.690
WHISTLING A HAPPY TUNE.

09:25.773 --> 09:28.276
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE I'D JUST
HAD SEX WITH THEM,

09:28.359 --> 09:30.403
THE END.

09:35.741 --> 09:39.161
- HOW IS IT POSSIBLE YOU HAVE
NEVER SEEN <i> CASABLANCA</i> BEFORE?

09:39.245 --> 09:42.039
- I ALWAYS MEANT TO,
I JUST NEVER GOT AROUND TO IT.

09:42.123 --> 09:44.250
I BET YOU'VE NEVER SEEN
<i>EVIL DEAD 2.</i>

09:44.333 --> 09:47.295
- DON'T YOU MEAN,
<i>EVIL DEAD 2: DEAD BY DAWN?</i>

09:47.378 --> 09:50.298
- I THINK YOU MAY BE
THE PERFECT WOMAN.

09:50.381 --> 09:53.884
- WELL...I'M NOT PERFECT.
- PROVE IT.

09:53.968 --> 09:56.178
TELL ME ONE TINY FLAW.
- OKAY.

09:56.262 --> 09:59.640
- I CAN NEVER REMEMBER
IF THERE ARE 24 OR 26 LETTERS

09:59.724 --> 10:01.017
IN THE ALPHABET.

10:01.100 --> 10:05.813
- WELL, NOW YOU DISGUST ME.

10:05.896 --> 10:10.693
JOY, WOULD YOU EVER,
IN A MILLION YEARS,

10:10.776 --> 10:12.737
CONSIDER GOING OUT
WITH ME?

10:14.572 --> 10:17.992
- NOT IN A MILLION YEARS.

10:18.075 --> 10:21.037
BUT I AM FREE
TOMORROW NIGHT.

10:21.120 --> 10:24.206
- TOMORROW?
REALLY? WITH ME?

10:24.290 --> 10:26.250
BUT I CAN'T BE THE KIND OF MAN
YOU USUALLY DATE.

10:26.334 --> 10:27.877
- WELL, I HOPE NOT.

10:27.960 --> 10:30.004
THE MEN I USUALLY DATE
ARE JERKS.

10:30.087 --> 10:32.882
- BUT DEVASTATINGLY HANDSOME,
CHARMING JERKS, RIGHT?

10:32.965 --> 10:34.759
- WHO CAN'T SEEM
TO LOVE ANYONE ELSE

10:34.842 --> 10:37.553
MORE THAN THEMSELVES.

10:37.636 --> 10:39.847
DID I SAY SOMETHING WRONG?

10:39.930 --> 10:42.183
- NO, THEY JUST SOUND
SO PATHETIC.

10:42.266 --> 10:44.769
- WELL, THEY'RE NOT YOU.

10:44.852 --> 10:47.938
AND BESIDES, PATHETIC IS SOMEONE
WHO'S NEVER SEEN <i> CASABLANCA.</i>

10:48.022 --> 10:49.398
- HOW MANY LETTERS
IN THE ALPHABET?

10:49.482 --> 10:51.692
- 20--

10:51.776 --> 10:55.196
AH, DAMN IT!

10:58.157 --> 11:02.411
- OKAY, ELKA, KEEP YOUR CAMERA
POINTED TOWARD ME.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.747
IN 3, 2, 1...

11:04.830 --> 11:06.749
THIS IS VICTORIA CHASE...

11:06.832 --> 11:08.751
ABOUT TO REVEAL AN UGLY TRUTH

11:08.834 --> 11:11.045
ABOUT THE JUDGMENTAL PEOPLE
OF CLEVELAND.

11:11.128 --> 11:13.714
WATCH
AS I AM INSTANTLY REJECTED

11:13.798 --> 11:17.259
BY A BUNCH
OF YOUNG MEN

11:17.343 --> 11:19.470
SIMPLY BECAUSE...
[whispering] I'M FAT.

11:19.553 --> 11:23.057
OKAY. I'LL TAKE
THE CAMERA NOW.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.602
HI!
CAN I PLAY DARTS WITH YOU?

11:26.685 --> 11:28.270
- SURE!
YOU CAN BE ON MY TEAM.

11:28.354 --> 11:32.400
- BUT...AREN'T YOU REPULSED
BY MY GIRTH?

11:32.483 --> 11:33.943
- NO!

11:34.026 --> 11:35.069
WE'VE GOT A PITCHER
RIGHT OVER THERE.

11:35.152 --> 11:36.278
POUR YOURSELF A BEER.

11:36.362 --> 11:37.905
- HMM.

11:37.988 --> 11:39.240
WAIT, MA'AM!
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T--

11:39.323 --> 11:41.117
- WHAT? BE ALLOWED TO MINGLE
WITH THE PUBLIC

11:41.200 --> 11:44.453
BECAUSE
I'M AN UNSIGHTLY WHALE?

11:44.537 --> 11:46.580
- I WAS GONNA SAY MAYBE
YOU SHOULDN'T SIT IN THAT CHAIR.

11:46.664 --> 11:49.208
IT'S FULL OF DARTS.

11:56.882 --> 11:58.634
[cell phone chirps]
- OH!

11:58.717 --> 12:02.638
IT'S SAM, THE CUTE SEXAHOLIC
I TOLD YOU ABOUT.

12:02.721 --> 12:05.683
OH, MY GOD, HE'S ASKING ME OUT.
SHOULD I?

12:05.766 --> 12:07.017
I MEAN,
I WANNA SAY YES,

12:07.101 --> 12:09.145
BUT HE'S SO YOUNG,
AND I JUST MET HIM.

12:09.228 --> 12:13.524
- AT A SEXAHOLIC MEETING!

12:13.607 --> 12:16.318
- BUT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,
WHAT IS A SEXAHOLIC ANYWAY?

12:16.402 --> 12:17.945
I MEAN, IF IT JUST MEANS
HE WANTS TO DO IT ALL THE TIME,

12:18.028 --> 12:19.822
DON'T ALL GUYS WANNA DO IT
ALL THE TIME?

12:19.905 --> 12:23.159
SO WHEN IT GETS DOWN TO IT,
ISN'T EVERY GUY A SEXAHOLIC?

12:23.242 --> 12:26.871
- MELANIE, SEXAHOLICS
HAVE NO STANDARDS.

12:26.954 --> 12:30.332
THEY'LL DO IT
WITH ANY SKANK IN TOWN.

12:30.416 --> 12:33.878
TALL, SHORT, SKINNY,
BONY, BRITISH.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.847
- HOW'D IT GO?
DID THE GUYS BLOW YOU OFF?

12:44.930 --> 12:47.016
- NO, THEY WERE ACTUALLY
VERY KIND,

12:47.099 --> 12:49.560
WHICH IS REALLY STARTING
TO PISS ME OFF.

12:49.643 --> 12:52.188
NOW IF ONE OF YOU
WOULD PLEASE PULL THE DARTS

12:52.271 --> 12:54.273
OUT OF MY DERRIERE.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.698
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO WIN A NEWSIE

13:02.781 --> 13:06.368
IF NOBODY WILL TREAT ME
LIKE THE BLIMP THAT I AM?

13:06.452 --> 13:08.537
I NEED TO FIND SOMEONE
WHO WILL INSULT ME ON FILM--

13:08.621 --> 13:09.455
OH, WAIT.

13:09.538 --> 13:10.998
WAIT, YOU SEE
THAT REALLY HANDSOME GUY

13:11.081 --> 13:12.208
SITTING UP AT THE BAR?

13:12.291 --> 13:13.876
I'M GONNA GO OVER THERE
AND FLIRT WITH HIM.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.336
AND THEN HE'LL REJECT ME,
AND THEN I'LL CRY,

13:15.419 --> 13:18.005
AND THEN I'LL RUN AWAY.

13:18.088 --> 13:19.548
- PERSONALLY, I'M THROUGH
WITH HANDSOME MEN.

13:19.632 --> 13:22.593
I LIKE CHUCK.
HE'S ADORABLE.

13:22.676 --> 13:23.844
AND HE'S JUST
THE OPPOSITE OF COLIN.

13:23.928 --> 13:25.513
HE'S THE ANTI-COLIN.

13:25.596 --> 13:28.432
AND SINCE I'M ANTI-COLIN,
WE'RE PERFECT FOR EACH OTHER.

13:28.516 --> 13:32.019
I DATED A FAT FELLOW ONCE.
LONG TIME AGO.

13:32.102 --> 13:37.733
- WAS IT WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT?

13:37.816 --> 13:41.195
- HELLO.
IS THIS BARSTOOL TAKEN?

13:41.278 --> 13:43.447
- NO.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.082
CAN I BUY YOU A DRINK?

13:53.165 --> 13:54.542
- WHAT?

13:54.625 --> 13:55.918
BUT WHY?

13:56.001 --> 13:57.503
AREN'T YOU REVOLTED
BY MY PENDULOUS BREASTS

13:57.586 --> 13:59.296
AND MY MASSIVE BUTTOCKS?

13:59.380 --> 14:01.382
- DON'T BE SO HARD
ON YOURSELF.

14:01.465 --> 14:02.883
IT'S WHAT'S ON THE INSIDE
THAT COUNTS.

14:05.302 --> 14:09.139
- SOMETIMES I REALLY HATE
THIS TOWN.

14:09.223 --> 14:10.891
- MELANIE WILL BE READY
IN A MINUTE.

14:10.975 --> 14:13.936
- OH, GREAT,
I'LL JUST WAIT OUT HERE.

14:14.019 --> 14:15.771
- UM...

14:15.854 --> 14:19.233
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?
- SURE.

14:19.316 --> 14:24.655
- YOU'RE A SEXAHOLIC, RIGHT?
- I AM.

14:24.738 --> 14:27.116
- MY GIRLFRIEND, CAROL,

14:27.199 --> 14:30.995
UH, HASN'T GOTTEN
LUCKY IN...

14:31.078 --> 14:35.958
5, 10--
ALL RIGHT, 50 YEARS.

14:36.041 --> 14:39.336
CATCH MY DRIFT?

14:39.420 --> 14:42.131
- YEAH, SORRY,
I'M IN RECOVERY.

14:42.214 --> 14:46.635
- WELL, SPREAD THE WORD AMONG
YOUR PERVERT FRIENDS, WILL YOU?

14:46.719 --> 14:49.805
LET ME KNOW.
- YES, MA'AM.

14:49.888 --> 14:52.141
- HE SAID NO ABOUT CAROL.
- I TOLD YOU NOT TO ASK HIM!

14:52.224 --> 14:56.103
- DAHH.

14:56.186 --> 14:58.480
- HI, YOU READY TO GO?
- YEAH, UM...

14:58.564 --> 15:00.274
CAN WE TALK FOR A MINUTE?
- YEAH.

15:00.357 --> 15:02.401
- I HAVE A LITTLE CONFESSION
TO MAKE.

15:02.484 --> 15:03.986
UM...

15:04.069 --> 15:06.614
YOU KNOW THAT WHOLE
SEXAHOLIC THING?

15:06.697 --> 15:07.948
GUESS WHAT.
NOT ONE!

15:08.032 --> 15:10.534
[chuckles nervously]
- STILL IN DENIAL.

15:10.618 --> 15:13.871
- NO, NO.
I'M NOT ADDICTED TO SEX.

15:13.954 --> 15:15.706
I MEAN, I LIKE SEX.
SURE, LIKE IT A LOT.

15:15.789 --> 15:17.499
ALWAYS READY TO DO IT.
WELL, NOT ALWAYS.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.835
NEED A LITTLE NOTICE,
SOME DECENT LIGHTING, B--

15:19.918 --> 15:21.503
LOOK.
[clears throat]

15:21.587 --> 15:24.173
MY FRIEND VICTORIA
IS A REPORTER,

15:24.256 --> 15:27.343
AND SHE PUT ON A FAT SUIT
TO SECRETLY FILM

15:27.426 --> 15:29.219
AN OVEREATERS MEETING,
AND I TAGGED ALONG.

15:29.303 --> 15:30.971
AND THE ONLY REASON I MET YOU
WAS BECAUSE I WAS HUNGRY.

15:31.055 --> 15:33.891
CAN YOU FORGIVE ME?

15:33.974 --> 15:35.517
- IF YOU CAN FORGIVE ME.

15:35.601 --> 15:38.520
- WHY WOULD I NEED TO?

15:38.604 --> 15:41.357
- MELANIE, I'M NOT
A SEXAHOLIC EITHER.

15:41.440 --> 15:44.568
I'M A REPORTER FOR CHANNEL 2.
- WHAT?

15:44.652 --> 15:46.111
- I WAS LOOKING
FOR THE PERFECT SUBJECT

15:46.195 --> 15:48.238
FOR MY <i> SEXAHOLICS LIKE ME</i>
PIECE,

15:48.322 --> 15:49.698
AND THEN I FOUND YOU.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.201
- [gasps] YOU WERE FILMING ME
ALL ALONG?

15:52.284 --> 15:53.410
- LOOK, WE CAN STILL
PIXELATE OUT YOUR FACE.

15:53.494 --> 15:55.871
NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW.

15:55.954 --> 15:57.039
RIGHT.

15:57.122 --> 16:01.168
I BETTER GO.

16:01.251 --> 16:03.545
UNLESS...

16:03.629 --> 16:06.215
WELL, I MEAN, MAYBE ALL THIS
HAPPENED FOR A REASON.

16:06.298 --> 16:09.718
I MEAN, I'M NOT A SEXAHOLIC.
YOU'RE NOT A SEXAHOLIC.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.261
I'M STILL A GUY.
AND I MEAN, COME ON.

16:11.345 --> 16:12.763
AREN'T ALL GUYS BASICALLY
JUST SEXAHOLICS?

16:12.846 --> 16:14.890
- [giggling]
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

16:14.973 --> 16:17.601
- SO WE WOULDN'T NECESSARILY
BE FALLING OFF THE WAGON

16:17.685 --> 16:18.686
IF WE WERE TO--

16:18.769 --> 16:20.604
- CONTINUE SEEING EACH OTHER?

16:20.688 --> 16:23.232
- I WAS GONNA SAY, "HAVE SEX."
BUT YEAH, THAT'S GOOD TOO.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.234
- YOU CAN'T EXPECT ME
TO JUST HOP IN THE SACK

16:25.317 --> 16:26.568
WITHOUT A FEW DINNERS FIRST.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.237
I AM NOT THAT KINDA GIRL...

16:28.320 --> 16:31.031
ANYMORE.

16:31.115 --> 16:35.786
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
<i>CASABLANCA</i> WAS GREAT.

16:35.869 --> 16:36.870
- IS THAT A TEAR
IN YOUR EYE?

16:36.954 --> 16:41.333
- NO, I'M A GUY.
GUYS DON'T CRY.

16:41.417 --> 16:42.418
BUT HOW COULD HE LET
INGRID BERGMAN

16:42.501 --> 16:43.877
GET ON THAT PLANE?

16:43.961 --> 16:47.047
- YOU'RE SUCH A SOFTIE.

16:47.131 --> 16:49.341
- MAYBE IT'S 'CAUSE
I'M LIKE A BIG PILLOW.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.093
- DON'T PUT YOURSELF DOWN.

16:51.176 --> 16:54.054
I FEEL A REAL CONNECTION
TO YOU.

16:54.138 --> 16:57.474
YOU'RE HONEST
AND WARM AND SWEET.

16:57.558 --> 17:01.061
AND SEXY TOO.

17:01.145 --> 17:03.897
- JOY, AS MUCH AS
I'D LOVE TO,

17:03.981 --> 17:05.983
I'M FEELING SELF-CONSCIOUS
RIGHT NOW.

17:06.066 --> 17:08.318
- BUT THAT'S SILLY.

17:08.402 --> 17:13.240
THIS IS OUR THIRD DATE.

17:13.323 --> 17:15.409
[screams]

17:15.492 --> 17:17.493
- DARLING, DARLING,
PLEASE LET ME EXPLAIN.

17:17.578 --> 17:18.996
- COLIN, IS THAT YOU?
- YES, YES!

17:19.079 --> 17:20.830
BUT IF YOU JUST GIVE ME
A CHANCE--

17:20.914 --> 17:22.708
- WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING
IN A FAT SUIT?

17:22.790 --> 17:24.167
- MY PLAN WAS TO DO

17:24.251 --> 17:25.752
A <i> FAT LIKE ME</i> EXPOSE
LIKE VICTORIA'S,

17:25.836 --> 17:27.296
BUT THEN I RAN INTO YOU AND--

17:27.378 --> 17:29.757
- AND YOU THOUGHT YOU'D HAVE
A GOOD LAUGH A MY EXPENSE?

17:29.840 --> 17:31.383
WELL, YOU'VE GOT YOUR CHEEK.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.802
- ACTUALLY,
YOU'VE GOT MY CHEEK.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.722
- GET OUT!

17:40.601 --> 17:43.270
- OUT OF MY WAY,
THUNDER THIGHS.

17:43.353 --> 17:46.982
THAT'S RIGHT, I'M TALKING
TO YOU, BLUBBER NUGGETS!

17:47.066 --> 17:50.986
- TERRIFIC PIECE.
REALLY SUPER.

17:51.069 --> 17:54.156
- YOU KNOW, COLIN, THE TIME
I SPENT DOING <i> FAT LIKE ME</i>

17:54.239 --> 17:56.450
WAS TRULY HARROWING.

17:56.533 --> 17:57.826
- WELL, AS IT TURNS OUT,

17:57.910 --> 17:59.828
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY REPORTER
TO GO UNDERCOVER

17:59.912 --> 18:01.663
AND BECOME FAT LIKE ME.

18:01.747 --> 18:04.166
LET'S ROLL TAPE, SHALL WE?

18:04.249 --> 18:07.377
- SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
IS YOUR DISGUSTED BY FAT PEOPLE.

18:07.461 --> 18:10.464
- LOOK, CHUCK, MAYBE
YOU SHOULD JUST SHOP YOUR...

18:10.547 --> 18:13.300
CONSIDERABLE WARES
ELSEWHERE.

18:13.383 --> 18:17.221
OH, PERHAPS THAT BUTTERBALL
OVER THERE.

18:17.304 --> 18:19.515
YOU KNOW, GALS THAT TO BE
IN THE "NO" BUSINESS,

18:19.598 --> 18:21.141
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.732
- UH...

18:28.816 --> 18:33.695
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY,
EXCEPT I'M SORRY.

18:33.779 --> 18:35.405
YOU KNOW, THE TRUTH IS THAT

18:35.489 --> 18:37.533
THE ENTIRE TIME THAT
I WAS FAT VICTORIA,

18:37.616 --> 18:42.412
NOT A SINGLE SOLITARY PERSON
IN THIS CITY WAS MEAN TO ME.

18:42.496 --> 18:47.709
THE ONLY PERSON WHO WAS EVER
UNKIND TO SOMEONE HEAVY WAS ME.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.753
SO I WANNA THANK YOU,
CLEVELAND,

18:49.837 --> 18:52.798
FOR TEACHING ME
A VALUABLE LESSON.

18:52.881 --> 18:56.009
[applause]

18:58.804 --> 19:01.765
AND I'LL BE SUBMITTING
A BRAND-NEW PIECE

19:01.849 --> 19:03.559
FOR THIS YEAR'S NEWSIE AWARDS

19:03.642 --> 19:08.397
ENTITLED <i> APOLOGETIC LIKE ME:</i>

19:08.480 --> 19:13.110
<i>HOW I FAKED BEING FAT AND</i>
<i>BECAME A BIGGER PERSON FOR IT.</i>

19:18.323 --> 19:23.537
- HOW COULD YOU HUMILIATE
VICTORIA ON THE AIR LIKE THAT?

19:23.620 --> 19:26.081
- OH, IT'S ALL RIGHT, JOY.

19:26.164 --> 19:27.916
SEE, COLIN'S PRANK FAILED,

19:28.000 --> 19:30.252
BUT MY MEA CULPA
TO THE PEOPLE OF CLEVELAND

19:30.335 --> 19:33.255
IS GONNA NET ME
A BIG, FAT NEWSIE.

19:33.338 --> 19:35.424
AND BY "FAT,"
I MEAN "BEAUTIFUL."

19:35.507 --> 19:38.385
YOU SEE HOW I'VE GROWN?

19:38.468 --> 19:40.637
- JOY, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.723
PLEASE LET ME EXPLAIN.

19:42.806 --> 19:44.808
- I JUST CAME HERE TO SLAP YOU
AND TAKE VICTORIA TO DINNER,

19:44.892 --> 19:46.435
NOT TO LISTEN
TO YOUR EXPLANATIONS.

19:46.518 --> 19:49.271
- LOOK, JOY...

19:49.354 --> 19:50.898
WHEN I WAS CHUCK,

19:50.981 --> 19:52.441
IT GAVE ME A CHANCE
TO START FRESH WITH YOU.

19:52.524 --> 19:54.985
TO BE A BETTER MAN WITH YOU.

19:55.068 --> 19:56.945
SPARRING WITH EACH OTHER
IS EXCITING,

19:57.029 --> 20:00.657
BUT IT FELT GOOD JUST TO BE
COMFORTABLE WITH EACH OTHER.

20:00.741 --> 20:03.118
I LIKE BEING CHUCK.

20:03.201 --> 20:06.997
- AND I LIKE BEING WITH CHUCK.
I MISS HIM.

20:07.080 --> 20:09.458
- HE'S RIGHT HERE.

20:09.541 --> 20:13.962
AND NOW YOU CAN HAVE
THE DROP-DEAD SEXINESS OF COLIN

20:14.046 --> 20:15.964
COMBINED WITH
THE PILLOWY SWEETNESS OF CHUCK.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.799
- I DON'T KNOW.

20:17.883 --> 20:19.259
- DO I HAVE TO PUT
THE FAT SUIT ON AGAIN?

20:19.343 --> 20:21.136
BECAUSE I'LL DO IT.

20:21.219 --> 20:23.972
JOY, I'M CRAZY ABOUT YOU.
- REALLY?

20:24.056 --> 20:26.058
- DOES THE ALPHABET
HAVE 26 LETTERS?

20:26.141 --> 20:27.559
- UH--
