WEBVTT

00:01.401 --> 00:02.269
April:  PREVIOUSLY
ON CHASING LIFE...

00:02.302 --> 00:04.137
-WILL YOU MARRY ME?
-YES.

00:04.171 --> 00:06.006
I THINK YOU'RE STILL
IN LOVE WITH APRIL.

00:06.040 --> 00:08.541
-SHE'S GETTING MARRIED.
-YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID "NO,

00:08.576 --> 00:10.678
-I'M NOT IN LOVE WITH HER."
-THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

00:10.711 --> 00:12.480
THE CHEMO DIDN'T DO
WHAT WE NEEDED IT TO DO.

00:12.512 --> 00:14.180
APRIL, YOU'RE NOT
IN REMISSION.

00:14.214 --> 00:16.283
WHAT IF A CLINICAL TRIAL
DOESN'T WORK?

00:16.317 --> 00:19.486
YOU HEARD HAMBURG, I CAN'T
GET A BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT
UNTIL I'M IN REMISSION.

00:19.519 --> 00:22.021
"THIS IS THE STORY
OF HOW I LIVED MY LIFE,

00:22.056 --> 00:24.492
AND PLANNED MY DEATH."

00:26.527 --> 00:28.629
I READ THESE OBITS,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I REALIZED?

00:28.661 --> 00:32.500
FOR MOST OF US, WHAT WE DO
FOR A LIVING IS GONNA BE,
LIKE, ONE LINE IN IT.

00:32.533 --> 00:37.237
I DON'T WANNA DIE,
AND I DON'T WANNA
STOP LIVING MY LIFE.

00:37.271 --> 00:39.506
I JUST NEED TO START
LIVING IT DIFFERENTLY.

01:04.665 --> 01:07.567
April: WE GOTTA GET TO THE
COURTHOUSE OR WE'RE GONNA
BE WAITING IN LINE FOR HOURS!

01:07.600 --> 01:09.569
YOU COULDN'T HAVE HAD BREAKFAST
BEFORE YOU CAME OVER?

01:09.602 --> 01:12.706
WOMAN, I WILL EAT
MY CEREAL WHEN I WANT TO!

01:12.739 --> 01:14.841
SORRY, I'M JUST PRACTICING
MY HUSBAND VOICE.

01:15.075 --> 01:18.144
HM. WELL, KEEP PRACTICING IT,
AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA NEED ONE.

01:18.179 --> 01:21.081
BOSSY. MM.
JUST LIKE A HENDRIE WOMAN.

01:21.114 --> 01:22.750
AH, CARVER WOMAN.
THAT'S NOT CHANGING.

01:22.783 --> 01:25.753
-APRIL CARVER HENDRIE?
-APRIL LAUREN CARVER.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.787
-OKAY, OKAY.
-YOU HAVE YOUR
BIRTH CERTIFICATE?

01:27.822 --> 01:29.689
THE ONE THAT YOU TEXTED ME
ABOUT SIX TIMES?

01:29.722 --> 01:32.593
-JUST PRACTICING
MY WIFE VOICE.
- TOUCHE.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.628
-AND 50 BUCKS?
-I HAVE A CREDIT CARD.

01:34.662 --> 01:38.132
-WELL, DO THEY TAKE CARDS?
-CHECKING.

01:38.164 --> 01:40.600
OKAY, WELL, WALK AND SEARCH.
LET'S GO.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.536
-OH, WAIT. APRIL.
-COME ON. TELL ME IN THE CAB.

01:42.569 --> 01:44.271
-NO, NO, NO... DID YOU SEE THIS?
-LET'S GO, LET'S GO.

01:44.305 --> 01:46.807
IT SAYS WE HAVE TO GET
MARRIED WITHIN 60 DAYS.

01:46.841 --> 01:48.641
OH, WELL... WHATEVER.
THAT'S FINE.

01:48.676 --> 01:50.743
BUT WHAT ABOUT YOUR
CLINICAL TRIAL? DO YOU KNOW
WHICH ONE YOU'RE DOING?

01:50.777 --> 01:53.180
NO, NOT YET.
I'M SEEING HAMBURG TODAY.

01:53.213 --> 01:54.647
WELL, WHAT IF YOU HAVE
TO GO BACK TO THE HOSPITAL?

01:54.682 --> 01:56.616
THAT WOULD KINDA GET
IN THE WAY OF A WEDDING.

01:56.650 --> 01:59.219
THEN LET'S JUST GO TO CITY HALL
AFTER WE GET OUR LICENSE.

01:59.253 --> 02:00.855
WELL, HEY, THAT'S FINE
WITH ME, BUT YOU'RE THE ONE

02:00.888 --> 02:04.457
WHO SAID YOU WANTED TO HAVE
THE WHOLE WEDDING EXPERIENCE.

02:06.659 --> 02:09.562
I GUESS I SHOULD JUST WAIT
AND SEE WHICH ONE I GET INTO.

02:11.431 --> 02:14.868
-OKAY.
-SO MUCH FOR LIVING
IN THE MOMENT.

02:18.405 --> 02:21.275
♪ YOU BET YOUR SOUL, HONEY ♪

02:21.307 --> 02:24.611
♪ YOU BET YOUR SOUL ♪

02:24.645 --> 02:29.516

02:29.550 --> 02:34.622

AND NEVER WANNA GO HOME ♪

02:34.655 --> 02:38.192
♪ 'CAUSE WE CAN'T STOP
WE WON'T STOP ♪

02:40.728 --> 02:44.163
Dr. Hamburg: APRIL,
YOU REALLY NEED TO START
YOUR CLINICAL TRIAL NOW.

02:44.198 --> 02:48.602
I KNOW. I STARTED LOOKING ONLINE
AND THERE ARE A MILLION OPTIONS.

02:48.635 --> 02:50.737
AND FOR EACH ONE THERE ARE
PEOPLE SAYING IT'S A MIRACLE

02:50.771 --> 02:53.873
AND THEN THERE ARE
THESE HORROR STORIES.

02:53.908 --> 02:56.843
LOOK, I HEAR YOU.
BUT THE LONGER YOU WAIT...

02:56.877 --> 03:00.580
I KNOW, BUT I JUST NEED
A COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE
I JUMP BACK INTO TREATMENT.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.849
WILL A COUPLE OF DAYS
MATTER THAT MUCH?

03:02.883 --> 03:04.685
AS LONG AS IT'S REALLY
GONNA BE A COUPLE OF DAYS.

03:04.717 --> 03:06.554
BUT YOU NEED TO PICK
A CLINICAL TRIAL

03:06.586 --> 03:08.455
SO WE CAN GET YOU
ON THE LIST.

03:08.489 --> 03:10.356
I RECOMMEND
THE SELKIN TRIAL.

03:10.390 --> 03:13.426
IT'S A LATER-PHASE TRIAL,
SO IT'S BEEN TESTED
A DECENT AMOUNT.

03:13.460 --> 03:17.531
NOT A LOT OF SIDE EFFECTS.
OUTPATIENT.

03:17.564 --> 03:19.567
OKAY. I'M IN.

03:19.599 --> 03:21.235
I HAD A FEELING
YOU MIGHT BE.

03:21.268 --> 03:24.471
SO I STARTED THE PROCESS
OF FILING YOUR APPLICATION.

03:24.504 --> 03:27.341
CAN I TELL THEM
YOU'LL START MONDAY?

03:27.373 --> 03:29.209
OKAY.

03:34.548 --> 03:35.582
(mellow rock plays)

03:35.615 --> 03:36.650
♪ I DREAM ABOUT YOU ♪

03:36.683 --> 03:39.319
♪ EVERY SINGLE DAY ♪

03:39.353 --> 03:42.622
-HI, MOM.
-WHAT'S WRONG?

03:42.656 --> 03:45.526
-I JUST SAID, "HI, MOM."
-I KNOW, BUT YOU ONLY
PLAY THAT...

03:45.558 --> 03:49.862
THAT HIPPIE, FLOWER CHILD CRAP
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING
TO CALM DOWN ABOUT SOMETHING.

03:49.896 --> 03:53.800
NOT TRUE. I'M FINE.
HOW ARE YOU?

03:53.834 --> 03:55.836
DID YOU AND SAM
HAVE FUN AT THE MOVIES?

03:55.868 --> 03:59.305
-YEAH, WE SAW A FOREIGN FILM.
-OH, THE ONE FROM IRAN

03:59.340 --> 04:00.841
ABOUT THE LITTLE GIRL
WHO COULDN'T FIND HER DAD

04:00.873 --> 04:02.643
AND THEY HAD TO SELL
THE FAMILY GOAT...

04:02.675 --> 04:06.913
THAT WAS BORING AS HELL.
WE WATCHED  GUARDIANS
OF THE GALAXY.

04:06.947 --> 04:09.782
AND THAT'S A FOREIGN FILM?

04:09.817 --> 04:11.752
WELL, IT DOESN'T
TAKE PLACE HERE.

04:11.784 --> 04:16.624
(chuckles) WELL, ARE YOU
GONNA TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG?

04:16.656 --> 04:18.658
IT'S JUST... MONEY.

04:18.692 --> 04:21.528
WITH APRIL NOT WORKING,
AND ALL THESE MEDICAL EXPENSES,

04:21.562 --> 04:24.999
AND CHARTON JUST RAISED
THEIR TUITION AGAIN.

04:25.031 --> 04:27.701
IT ALREADY COSTS AS MUCH
AS A PRIVATE COLLEGE.

04:27.735 --> 04:30.504
WE JUST CAN'T KEEP
BLEEDING MONEY LIKE THIS.

04:30.536 --> 04:33.574
IF YOU WERE SMART,
YOU'D JUST PUSH ME
DOWN THE STAIRS.

04:33.606 --> 04:36.976
I HAVE A KILLER LIFE
INSURANCE POLICY. LITERALLY.

04:37.011 --> 04:38.678
MOM, SERIOUSLY.

04:38.711 --> 04:42.016
SOMETHING'S GOTTA GO,
OR WE'LL END UP WITH NOTHING.

04:42.048 --> 04:45.653
AND I'M THINKING
IT'S GONNA BE CHARTON.

04:45.685 --> 04:48.488
I MEAN, THE WHOLE REASON
I SENT BRENNA TO THAT SCHOOL
IN THE FIRST PLACE

04:48.521 --> 04:51.524
WAS TO KEEP HER OUT
OF TROUBLE AND GET HER
ON THE PATH TOWARDS COLLEGE.

04:51.557 --> 04:54.995
AND SHE'S DOING FINE
AND SHE DOESN'T EVEN
WANT TO GO TO COLLEGE.

04:55.028 --> 04:57.665
EVEN THOUGH WE'VE SET ASIDE
THAT WHOLE COLLEGE FUND,

04:57.697 --> 05:00.334
WHICH IS ANOTHER
POTENTIAL WASTE OF MONEY.

05:00.367 --> 05:04.672
AND THAT TOILET UPSTAIRS
IS MAKING WEIRD NOISES.

05:04.704 --> 05:08.509
WHICH IS PROBABLY GONNA COST
A TON OF MONEY TO REPAIR.

05:08.541 --> 05:13.579
I KNOW, IT'S HARD.
THAT'S WHY I'M SO GLAD THAT DAD
ALWAYS HANDLED OUR MONEY.

05:13.613 --> 05:15.783
WELL, IT'S NOT
LIKE I COST THAT MUCH.

05:15.815 --> 05:20.653
(laughs) THIS FROM THE GIRL
WHO BEGGED HER PARENTS
TO BANKROLL A TRIP TO SPAIN

05:20.687 --> 05:24.858
SO THAT SHE COULD DRIVE
AROUND IN A MINI-BUS
WITH HER BOYFRIEND.

05:24.891 --> 05:27.627
-SIMPLER TIMES.
-NO. THEY WEREN'T
THAT MUCH SIMPLER.

05:27.661 --> 05:31.598
YOU JUST DON'T REMEMBER
BECAUSE YOU WERE TOO STONED.

05:35.034 --> 05:37.805
I DID NOT THINK YOU
WERE SERIOUS THE OTHER NIGHT
ABOUT ENDING THINGS.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.641
-I MEAN,
YOU WERE PRETTY DRUNK.
-I WAS DRUNK.

05:40.673 --> 05:43.644
BUT I MEANT WHAT I SAID.
THAT'S KIND OF HOW
DRINKING WORKS.

05:43.677 --> 05:46.913
-I THOUGHT WE LIKED EACH OTHER.
-YEAH. AS WHAT, THOUGH?

05:46.947 --> 05:49.550
ARE YOU TELLING ME YOU THINK
THERE'S A REAL FUTURE?

05:52.786 --> 05:55.656
RIGHT.
THAT'S KIND OF MY PROBLEM.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.990
I WAS JUST
TAKING IT DAY BY DAY.

05:58.024 --> 06:00.961
ME TOO. BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH
FOR ME ANYMORE.

06:00.994 --> 06:03.896
TAKING THINGS DAY BY DAY
MADE ME REALIZE

06:03.930 --> 06:08.968
THAT I WANT SOMEONE WHO
WANTS MORE THAN DAY BY DAY.

06:09.002 --> 06:11.105
WITH ME.

06:14.742 --> 06:18.678
IT'S... IT'S COMPLICATED.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.646
MM. NOT FOR ME.

06:27.687 --> 06:28.689
OKAY.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.665
Woman on iPad:
I saw you flirting with him.

06:38.699 --> 06:40.500
I (bleep).
We've been married ten years.

06:40.533 --> 06:42.903
LET ME GUESS.
REAL HOUSEWIVES  AGAIN?

06:42.935 --> 06:46.406
-WHAT ELSE?
-THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT
WATCHING THAT SHOW ALONE

06:46.439 --> 06:49.576
THAT MAKES YOU REALIZE
JUST HOW BORING IT IS.

06:49.610 --> 06:50.677
SHE'S NOT ALONE.

06:51.812 --> 06:54.113
OH, HEY, VANESSA.

06:54.148 --> 06:56.182
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU GUYS
KNEW EACH OTHER.

06:56.415 --> 06:58.685
OH, YEAH.
MEG'S MY DRINKING BUDDY.

06:58.718 --> 07:00.821
-(chuckles)
-HM...

07:00.853 --> 07:02.588
SO DID YOU START
YOUR CLINICAL TRIAL?

07:02.622 --> 07:05.725
NO, I JUST GOT
INTO THE SELKIN TRIAL.
SO I START IN A COUPLE DAYS.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.728
-WHAT MADE YOU CHOOSE THAT ONE?
-I DIDN'T. HAMBURG DID.

07:08.762 --> 07:14.067
OH. SO YOU'RE JUST
LETTING HAMBURG TAKE
THE DRIVER'S SEAT HERE?

07:14.100 --> 07:17.004
YEAH, ISN'T THAT
KIND OF HER JOB?

07:17.036 --> 07:20.706
I USED TO THINK THAT,
AND THEN I GOT INTO
A COUPLE OF BAD CLINICAL TRIALS

07:20.740 --> 07:25.444
THAT MY DOCTOR RECOMMENDED
AND I REALIZED, THIS IS MY LIFE.

07:25.478 --> 07:27.781
-NOT THEIRS.
-YEAH. HAMBURG'S NOT
THE ONE WHO'S GONNA DIE

07:27.814 --> 07:30.884
IF SHE'S WRONG ABOUT THIS.

07:30.918 --> 07:32.985
(sighs) I'M JUST SAYING,

07:33.019 --> 07:35.454
IT'S UP TO YOU
HOW YOU WANNA STEER THIS.

07:35.488 --> 07:40.194
OKAY, SO I DO ALL OF THIS
RESEARCH, AND THEN WHAT?

07:41.661 --> 07:42.762
TRUST YOUR GUT.

07:42.795 --> 07:44.932
I'M NOT SO GOOD AT THAT.

07:44.965 --> 07:48.034
MY BRAIN'S USUALLY BUZZING
TOO LOUD FOR ME TO HEAR IT.

07:48.067 --> 07:51.038
I USUALLY MAKE MY BEST DECISIONS
WHEN I TURN MY BRAIN OFF
FOR A FEW DAYS.

07:51.071 --> 07:53.874
DO YOUR RESEARCH
AND THEN JUST DISTRACT YOURSELF.

07:53.906 --> 07:57.244
-GO ON A BENDER OR WHATEVER.
-(Meg chuckles)

07:57.476 --> 07:58.711
CHECK OUT.

07:58.745 --> 08:00.848
SILENCE THE MIND
TO HEAR THE HEART.

08:00.880 --> 08:03.115
THAT WAS VERY ZEN, MEG.

08:03.149 --> 08:06.185
-I HAVE A JAPANESE STEPMOTHER.
-OH.

08:06.220 --> 08:09.088
-(Meg chuckles)
-(April chuckles weakly)

08:12.925 --> 08:17.663
SO WE WANT TO MAKE
A SHORT FILM THAT'S
LIKE A SEXY, COMEDIC TAKE...

08:17.697 --> 08:20.033
REDUNDANT.
SEX IS ALWAYS COMEDIC.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.937
IT'S A PARODY
OF A CLASSIC FRENCH FARCE

08:23.971 --> 08:25.738
SET IN AN AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL.

08:25.771 --> 08:30.276
IT DEALS WITH THE THEME OF
HOW FLUID MODERN SEXUALITY IS.

08:30.509 --> 08:35.048
SO FORD WOULD PLAY A GIRL
WHO IS TRYING TO DECIDE
BETWEEN TWO GUYS,

08:35.081 --> 08:36.750
MEANWHILE THEY'RE HIDING
THEIR LOVE FOR EACH OTHER.

08:36.783 --> 08:39.753
-ART IMITATES LIFE.
-IN YOUR DREAMS.

08:39.786 --> 08:43.090
-DUDE, HOMOPHOBIC MUCH?
-DUDE, YOU KNOW I HAVE TWO MOMS.

08:43.123 --> 08:46.125
Margo: THIS SOUNDS LIKE
A REALLY COOL IDEA, YOU GUYS.

08:46.158 --> 08:48.761
LET ME KNOW HOW I CAN HELP.
I LOVE A GOOD FARCE.

08:48.794 --> 08:50.529
I ALREADY WATCHED ALL
THE ONES YOU RECOMMENDED.

08:50.563 --> 08:51.697
AND DIDN'T NEED
THE SUBTITLES

08:51.731 --> 08:54.735
'CAUSE I SPEAK
FLUENT FRENCH.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.302
Margo: WHEN YOU GUYS ARE
FINISHED, I THINK YOU SHOULD

08:56.536 --> 08:57.703
DEFINITELY SUBMIT
TO THE NEW ENGLAND

08:57.738 --> 08:59.673
-PRIVATE SCHOOL FILM FESTIVAL.
-DUDE, NO.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.975
I DON'T NEED KIDS FROM OTHER
SCHOOLS WATCHING US MAKE OUT.

09:02.009 --> 09:06.712
DUDE, YES. AND THEN YOU CAN
PUT LGBTQ ACTIVISM ON YOUR
COLLEGE APPLICATION.

09:06.746 --> 09:10.750
-BROWN WOULD LOVE THAT.
-SO WOULD AMHERST. WE'RE DOWN.

09:10.783 --> 09:13.687
(laughs)
GOOD NEGOTIATING, BRENNA.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.554
YOU'LL HAVE NO TROUBLE
IN HOLLYWOOD.

09:18.692 --> 09:21.695
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
UH, WHAT'S THE OFFER?

09:21.727 --> 09:25.698
OKAY, AND THE BACK END?

09:25.731 --> 09:27.067
AMAZING. CLOSE IT.

09:27.100 --> 09:29.101
OKAY, THANKS.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.806
-I JUST SOLD MY NEXT BOOK.
-OH, YEAH?

09:32.838 --> 09:34.774
-YEAH.
-WOW! THAT'S GREAT.

09:34.807 --> 09:37.311
SORRY, WAS THAT INSENSITIVE?
I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING
ON A BOOK TOO.

09:37.344 --> 09:39.679
IT'S COOL.
I DON'T FEEL COMPETITIVE
WITH YOU OR ANYTHING.

09:39.712 --> 09:43.250
PLUS I DON'T REALLY
CONSIDER A BOOK THAT COMES
WITH A FREE CD LITERATURE.

09:43.283 --> 09:45.686
YEAH, IT'S GOOD THAT
YOU'RE NOT COMPETITIVE.

09:45.719 --> 09:48.989
SERIOUSLY, MAN, CONGRATS.
YOU, UH, DOING ANYTHING
TO CELEBRATE?

09:49.022 --> 09:52.658
I SHOULD, RIGHT?
I MEAN, I JUST MADE MORE MONEY
THAN I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.

09:52.692 --> 09:55.662
-YOU KNOW WHAT'S WAY COOLER
THAN WHATEVER YOU JUST MADE?
-WHAT?

09:55.696 --> 09:58.230
TWICE WHATEVER YOU JUST MADE.
I'M SERIOUS, MAN.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.333
WE SHOULD, LIKE,
GO TO THE CASINO OR SOMETHING.

10:00.366 --> 10:02.369
-YOU EVER BEEN TO SPIRIT LAKE?
-IN CONNECTICUT? NO.

10:02.601 --> 10:05.605
WELL, NOT TO BRAG,
BUT I HAVE MAD GAMBLING SKILLS.

10:05.639 --> 10:08.174
I PAID FOR MY FIRST CAR
THROUGH ONLINE POKER, AT 16.

10:08.207 --> 10:10.610
-ISN'T THAT ILLEGAL?
-TOTALLY. BUT THIS ISN'T.

10:10.644 --> 10:13.379
AND HEY, WHAT BETTER WAY
TO GET OVER YOUR BREAKUP THAN
TO BE AROUND A BUNCH OF GIRLS

10:13.613 --> 10:15.282
WHO JUST WANT
TO HAVE FUN, RIGHT?

10:15.315 --> 10:17.650
AS LONG AS YOU
DON'T USE THE PHRASE
"GIRLS JUST WANNA HAVE FUN"

10:17.683 --> 10:21.822
-IN FRONT OF ANY ACTUAL GIRLS.
-WHATEVER, BRO.
IT'S WORKED BEFORE.

10:25.725 --> 10:27.326
(knocking)

10:29.395 --> 10:31.130
OH, MY GOD! WHAT'S WRONG?

10:31.163 --> 10:32.765
YOU NEVER JUST
SHOW UP WITHOUT CALLING,

10:32.798 --> 10:34.701
AND THEN CALLING
A SECOND TIME TO CONFIRM,

10:34.735 --> 10:36.635
AND THEN UPDATING YOUR CALENDAR
IF YOU'RE RUNNING LATE.

10:36.669 --> 10:39.038
I KNOW, I'M JUST...
I'M RESEARCHING
ALL OF THESE TRIALS

10:39.072 --> 10:40.874
AND TRYING NOT TO OVERTHINK
ANYTHING RIGHT NOW.

10:40.907 --> 10:44.378
SO I JUST WANTED
TO BE SOMEWHERE WHERE
I COULD JUST CLEAR MY HEAD.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.712
APRIL,
DID YOU JUST KILL SOMEONE?

10:46.746 --> 10:48.881
NO, BUT FUNNY
YOU SHOULD SAY THAT.

10:48.914 --> 10:52.318
I'M TRYING NOT
TO KILL MYSELF.

10:52.351 --> 10:54.086
I HAVE TO PICK
A CLINICAL TRIAL.

10:54.120 --> 10:58.692
AND I JUST... I NEED
TO TAKE A COUPLE OF DAYS
AND NOT THINK ABOUT IT.

10:58.725 --> 11:01.394
I JUST NEED TO TURN OFF
MY COMPUTER, MY BRAIN.

11:01.427 --> 11:03.429
STOP OBSESSING.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.664
AND JUST LIVE IN THE NOW.

11:05.698 --> 11:08.735
AND HAVE SOME FUN
WHILE I STILL CAN.

11:08.769 --> 11:09.836
AND THEN I'LL
COME BACK TO IT.

11:09.870 --> 11:12.739
SO...

11:12.773 --> 11:15.908
DO YOU WANNA GO TO BERMUDA?

11:15.942 --> 11:18.845
-WE NEVER WENT.
-LIKE, NOW?

11:18.879 --> 11:21.782
YES, I CHECKED FLIGHTS,
AND THEY ARE SUPER CHEAP
RIGHT NOW.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.817
AND I BET YOU COULD
USE A VACATION.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.418
I CAN'T.

11:25.451 --> 11:27.453
I CAN'T, I HAVE THIS BIG
CONFERENCE CALL IN TWO DAYS.

11:27.687 --> 11:28.989
AND IT'S KIND OF
LIKE MY THING.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.124
I'VE BEEN HARASSING
THESE BUYERS FROM THIS HUGE

11:31.158 --> 11:34.427
DEPARTMENT STORE IN LONDON
TO SEE JACLYN'S NEW LINE,
AND THEY FINALLY DID,

11:34.461 --> 11:37.264
AND, WELL, NOW THEY WANT
TO TALK TO BOTH OF US.

11:37.297 --> 11:38.731
THAT IS SO AMAZING.

11:38.764 --> 11:42.436
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE TRIP.
IT WAS JUST AN IDEA.

11:45.138 --> 11:47.874
THEY HAVE PHONES
IN BERMUDA, RIGHT?

11:47.908 --> 11:49.775
-REALLY?
-YEAH. SCREW IT!

11:49.809 --> 11:51.845
COME ON,
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!
LET'S GO, LIKE, IMMEDIATELY.

11:51.878 --> 11:54.047
SHH! I DON'T WANT NATALIE
TO FEEL BAD THAT WE'RE
NOT INVITING HER.

11:54.081 --> 11:55.715
OH, SHE'S NOT HERE.
YOU'RE FINE.

11:55.749 --> 11:58.751
-DOMINIC'S?
-WELL, NO.
THEY BROKE UP, ACTUALLY.

11:58.784 --> 12:03.222
-REALLY? WHAT HAPPENED?
-DON'T KNOW.
SHE'S NOT TALKING ABOUT IT.

12:03.255 --> 12:05.759
ALL I KNOW IS SHE'S BEEN
AT SOME DINER DOWN THE BLOCK,

12:05.792 --> 12:07.461
SPENDING HER NIGHTS THERE
JUST READING.

12:07.494 --> 12:09.929
I GUESS IT'S
HELPING HER GET OVER IT.

12:09.962 --> 12:11.465
SORRY, NATALIE IS SPENDING
HER NIGHTS READING?

12:11.498 --> 12:12.499
YEAH, I KNOW.

12:12.731 --> 12:13.767
SHE'S FULL OF SURPRISES.

12:13.799 --> 12:16.168
WELL, SO ARE WE,
STARTING TOMORROW AT...

12:16.202 --> 12:19.905
...10:56 A.M. SOUNDS LIKE
A GOOD TIME TO ARRIVE
ON A TROPICAL ISLAND.

12:19.940 --> 12:23.375
WHY, YES, I THINK IT IS.
(laughs)

12:32.485 --> 12:34.855
-Beth: WHOO!
-April: WE MADE IT!

12:34.888 --> 12:39.125
OH, MY GOD!
LOOK AT THIS VIEW! APRIL!

12:39.158 --> 12:42.062
-LOOK AT THIS PLACE!
-OH, MY...

12:42.095 --> 12:45.798
(gasps) WOW! OH!

12:45.831 --> 12:48.434
-CAN WE STAY FOREVER?
-DEFINITELY.

12:48.467 --> 12:52.205
-YEAH.
-(laughs)

12:52.239 --> 12:54.841
(gasps) THIS IS FABULOUS!

12:54.875 --> 12:58.544
OOH! DON'T MIND IF I DO.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.246
I'M GONNA MAKE US SOME DRINKS,

13:00.279 --> 13:02.448
AND THEN WE'LL GO
INTO TOWN IN LIKE, 15?

13:02.481 --> 13:06.153
UH, I SHOULD PROBABLY
DO A LITTLE WORK TO PREP
FOR THIS CALL TOMORROW.

13:06.186 --> 13:08.455
YOU KNOW, JUST SO I'M
NOT STRESSING LATER.

13:08.488 --> 13:12.091
BETH, IF THERE'S ANYTHING
I LEARNED FROM TAKING WORK
WAY TOO SERIOUSLY,

13:12.125 --> 13:14.461
IT'S THAT YOU CAN TOTALLY
BS A CONFERENCE CALL.
THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF IT.

13:14.494 --> 13:16.462
-'CAUSE NOBODY CAN SEE YOU.
-OH, NO, I'M PLANNING

13:16.495 --> 13:17.898
TO TAKE THIS CALL
ON THE TOILET.

13:17.931 --> 13:19.966
I JUST THINK
I SHOULD PREPARE FIRST.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.235
WELL, DON'T YOU WANT
TO EXPLORE WHILE IT'S
STILL LIGHT OUT, THOUGH?

13:23.269 --> 13:25.905
I MEAN, WE CAN GO SHOPPING
FOR FUN CLOTHES!

13:25.938 --> 13:27.974
DID YOU SEE ALL
THOSE CUTE STORES?

13:28.008 --> 13:29.509
YEAH, I DIDN'T SEE
ANY BLAZERS IN THE WINDOWS,

13:29.543 --> 13:30.976
SO I DOUBT
YOU'LL FIND ANYTHING.

13:31.010 --> 13:33.513
VACATION APRIL
DOESN'T WEAR BLAZERS.

13:33.547 --> 13:36.149
AND WHAT DOES
"VACATION APRIL" WEAR?

13:36.182 --> 13:39.952
I DON'T KNOW.
I'VE NEVER BEEN ON A VACATION.

13:39.985 --> 13:43.155
ACTUALLY, NO, THAT'S A LIE.
I WENT TO AMSTERDAM
SPRING BREAK SENIOR YEAR.

13:43.190 --> 13:46.125
I WAS DOING A REPORT
ON THE PARLIAMENTARY
DEMOCRACY AND...

13:46.158 --> 13:47.427
NOT A VACATION.

13:49.196 --> 13:51.163
I HAD A BEER BEFORE WE WENT
TO THE ANNE FRANK HOUSE.

13:51.197 --> 13:54.267
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.
PLEASE, JUST STOP WHERE YOU ARE.

13:54.301 --> 13:57.102
-YES!
-(laughs) CHEERS.

13:58.138 --> 13:59.405
(giggles)

14:05.077 --> 14:09.615
-DUDE, HURRY UP WITH THE SHOTS!
-I'M COMING, I'M COMING!

14:09.849 --> 14:13.352
-SO WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
-LAUREN.

14:13.385 --> 14:15.054
WHAT BRINGS YOU
DOWN HERE, LAUREN?

14:15.087 --> 14:16.222
-OH, THE USUAL.
-(cell phone rings)

14:16.255 --> 14:17.323
MY FRIEND AND I TRYING

14:17.356 --> 14:19.024
TO ESCAPE OUR LIVES.

14:19.058 --> 14:21.595
OH, TOTALLY GET THAT.
MY BUDDIES AND I WORK
AT GOLDMAN.

14:21.628 --> 14:24.530
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE
HAD A BREAK IN, LIKE, A MONTH.

14:24.563 --> 14:26.365
SEEMS LIKE YOUR FRIEND
CAN RELATE.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.467
HEY, COME HANG OUT WITH US.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.903
WE'RE CELEBRATING MY BUDDY
DAVE'S BACHELOR PARTY.

14:30.937 --> 14:32.572
THERE MAY BE SOME
UNSAVORY GUY TALK, BUT...

14:32.605 --> 14:34.441
THAT'S OKAY.
I'M PRETTY HARD TO SHOCK.

14:34.474 --> 14:35.908
WANNA GIVE ME A HAND
WITH THESE SHOTS?

14:35.942 --> 14:38.477
-SURE.

14:38.510 --> 14:42.282
-I'LL TAKE THIS...

14:42.315 --> 14:43.549
-OH, HEY, GUYS!

15:04.070 --> 15:05.538

15:05.572 --> 15:08.475
-BUT THAT'S KINDA SHADY.
-NO, I'M, LIKE,

15:08.508 --> 15:10.210
THE LEAST SHADY
PERSON YOU WILL EVER...

15:10.243 --> 15:12.511
IS THIS WHAT MICHELLE'S

AT HER BACHELORETTE?

15:12.544 --> 15:14.447
NO! NO, NO. NO.
SHE WOULDN'T...

15:14.480 --> 15:16.482
OH, MAN, IF SHE'S TRYING
TO HOOK UP WITH SOME RANDOM...

15:16.515 --> 15:17.917
-I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING!
-I GOTTA CALL HER.

15:17.951 --> 15:18.985
SHE'S NOT. NO...

15:19.019 --> 15:22.554

15:34.533 --> 15:38.538
-HEY. YOU GOT A SEC?
-YEAH. JUST ONE.

15:38.571 --> 15:41.707
I'M GOING INTO CAMBRIDGE

15:41.941 --> 15:44.043
HEY, IS IT COOL
IF WE GO TO A CONCERT AFTER?

15:44.076 --> 15:46.046
IT'S THIS
LAST-MINUTE SURPRISE SHOW.

15:46.078 --> 15:48.715
-IT'S FOLK MUSIC.
-WHY DID YOU SAY THAT?

15:48.947 --> 15:52.451
UH, GRANDMA SAID
THAT YOU'D BE MORE LIKELY
TO LET ME GO IF I DID.

15:52.485 --> 15:55.721
-SO IT'S NOT FOLK MUSIC?
-NO, IT IS.

15:55.955 --> 15:59.725
APRIL PUT A SONG BY THIS GIRL
ON THE PLAYLIST THAT SHE MADE ME
FOR MY STEM CELL DONATION.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.494
OH, THAT'S SWEET. SURE.

16:01.528 --> 16:04.998
-AS LONG AS YOU'RE HOME BY 11.
-I KNOW. I GOT IT. THANKS, MOM.

16:05.030 --> 16:09.469
ACTUALLY, I WANTED
TO CHECK IN ON HOW THINGS
ARE GOING AT SCHOOL.

16:09.501 --> 16:11.571
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

16:11.604 --> 16:14.173
WELL, I JUST REMEMBER
YOU TALKING A LOT

16:14.206 --> 16:18.110
ABOUT HOW YOU DIDN'T FEEL LIKE
YOU REALLY FIT IN AT CHARTON.

16:18.144 --> 16:21.213
AND, I DON'T KNOW,
NOW WITH GREER GONE,

16:21.246 --> 16:23.416
I GUESS I JUST WAS WONDERING
IF YOU'VE HAD ANY THOUGHTS

16:23.450 --> 16:26.753
ABOUT MAYBE STARTING OVER
SOMEWHERE NEW.

16:26.985 --> 16:28.221
YOU KNOW, CLEAN SLATE.

16:28.254 --> 16:30.990
ACTUALLY, I REALLY
LIKE CHARTON NOW.

16:31.024 --> 16:33.225
-YOU DO?
-YEAH.

16:33.259 --> 16:36.328
I FEEL LIKE I FINALLY
HAVE A GROUP THERE.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.565
AND THEY HAVE THIS
REALLY COOL NEW FILM CLUB.

16:38.597 --> 16:42.369
I'M GONNA MAKE A SHORT FILM
AND SUBMIT IT TO THIS
FILM FESTIVAL.

16:42.402 --> 16:45.304
-I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IT.
-COOL.

16:45.337 --> 16:47.474
ANYWAY, I SHOULD
PROBABLY FINISH GETTING READY.

(electronic dance music plays)

17:01.553 --> 17:03.255
(crowd chattering)

17:13.098 --> 17:15.300
OH, HEY. HI.

17:15.335 --> 17:18.337

17:18.371 --> 17:19.705
-YO, HOLD UP.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.740
-I DON'T WANT
TO GET MY ASS KICKED.
-WHAT?

17:21.775 --> 17:25.144
LAST TIME I SMOKED UP A MARRIED
CHICK HER HUSBAND BEAT ME UP.

17:38.258 --> 17:40.393

17:40.426 --> 17:41.693

17:45.330 --> 17:48.134
April: THAT GUY,

-(laughs)

18:02.615 --> 18:04.483
THANK YOU SO MUCH

18:04.517 --> 18:07.420
-OF COURSE.
-IT FEELS SO NICE

18:07.453 --> 18:09.189
NOT HAVE TO BE
A SICK PERSON RIGHT NOW,

18:09.221 --> 18:13.726
AND JUST GET TO BE
A NORMAL GIRL ON VACATION
WITH HER BEST FRIEND.

18:13.759 --> 18:16.663
IT SERIOUSLY MEANS,
LIKE, EVERYTHING TO ME.

18:16.695 --> 18:19.132
-I LOVE YOU, FREAK.
-I LOVE YOU TOO.

18:19.164 --> 18:21.768
(laughs) NOW, LET'S MAKE
THIS A NIGHT TO REMEMBER.

18:21.800 --> 18:24.770
-OH, THAT SOUNDS SEXUAL.
-GOOD.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.538
-NOW, DRINK IT.
-OH, BOY.

18:26.573 --> 18:27.606

OKAY.

18:30.809 --> 18:31.810
WHOO!

18:31.845 --> 18:34.881

18:35.114 --> 18:38.151
-YOU LOOK THIRSTY.
-TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH.

18:38.183 --> 18:40.619
-YOU COULD HAVE COME OVER TO ME.
-NAH.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.689
I LIKE A WOMAN
WHO KNOWS WHAT SHE WANTS.

18:42.721 --> 18:44.223
WHO SAYS I KNOW WHAT I WANT?

18:44.257 --> 18:46.492
WELL, YOU KNOW
YOU WANT ATTENTION.

18:46.526 --> 18:48.595
I MEAN, YOU'RE WEARING THAT
TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE LITERALLY

18:48.627 --> 18:50.864
THE SHINIEST OBJECT
IN SIGHT. RIGHT?

18:50.896 --> 18:53.333
IT'S LIKE YOU
SEE INSIDE MY SOUL.

19:00.606 --> 19:04.243
-(dance music plays)
-(crowd chattering)

19:06.479 --> 19:08.681
Girl: LOVE IT!

19:13.920 --> 19:15.488
EXCUSE ME.

19:15.521 --> 19:18.357

19:18.391 --> 19:20.660
-PLENTY MORE WHERE

-THANK YOU.

19:20.692 --> 19:24.730
YOU DON'T LOOK
LIKE YOU NEED IT, THOUGH.
YOU SEEM PRETTY CHILL ALREADY.

19:24.763 --> 19:28.233
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S EVER
USED THAT WORD TO DESCRIBE ME.

19:28.268 --> 19:30.636
(laughs) WHAT CAN I SAY?
I'M A POET.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.638

Dominic: ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
LET ME GET THIS.

21:15.974 --> 21:18.377
WELCOME,
MAKE YOURSELVES AT HOME.

21:18.411 --> 21:20.579
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE WON 500 BUCKS

21:20.613 --> 21:23.482
AND YOU WOULDN'T LET ME STOP AT
THAT PAWN SHOP ON THE WAY BACK!

21:23.516 --> 21:25.317
WHAT WOULD YOU EVEN
GET AT A PAWN SHOP?

21:25.351 --> 21:26.853
I SWEAR TO GOD I SAW
A CROWN IN THAT WINDOW.

21:26.885 --> 21:29.055
-LIKE FOR TEETH?
-NO. LIKE FOR YOUR HEAD.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.890
LIKE IT BELONGED TO SOME KING.
IT COULD HAVE BEEN MINE.

21:30.923 --> 21:32.525
Dominic: THAT'S NOT
A GOOD USE OF MY MONEY.

21:32.557 --> 21:33.826
Danny: UNLIKE A COUNTRY
MUSIC CONCERT

21:33.859 --> 21:36.362
-IN THE MIDDLE OF A RACETRACK?
-I LOVE FAITH HILL.

21:36.395 --> 21:37.663
YOU WOULD.
YOU'RE KINDA COUNTRY.

21:37.697 --> 21:40.365
SHUT UP!

21:40.400 --> 21:44.470
SO, DOMINIC, WANNA SHOW ME THAT
RECORD COLLECTION IN YOUR ROOM?

21:44.503 --> 21:47.707
-YEAH.
-UM, ALL THE RECORDS
ARE OUT HERE.

21:47.740 --> 21:51.076
-NOT IN DOMINIC'S ROOM.
-ACTUALLY, THERE'S ANOTHER
RECORD PLAYER IN MY ROOM.

21:51.309 --> 21:55.080
I WAS JUST TELLING LAYLA
ALL ABOUT MY OTHER RECORDS.
COME ON.

22:01.086 --> 22:03.588
(Dominic and Layla laughing)

22:06.625 --> 22:08.894
SO, WANNA SEE
IF WE CAN FIND SOME BEER?

22:08.928 --> 22:12.330
-I'M GOOD.
-COOL.

22:12.365 --> 22:14.400
COOL. ME TOO.

22:19.105 --> 22:21.473
SO, WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

22:21.507 --> 22:23.542
UM, RIGHT AROUND
SPIRIT LAKE, ACTUALLY.

22:23.576 --> 22:24.810
MY FAMILY'S LIVED
THERE FOR YEARS.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.612
OH, YEAH? SINCE
BACK WHEN IT WAS A RESERVATION?

22:26.645 --> 22:29.816
-I'M PUERTO RICAN.
-OH. THAT'S TOO BAD.

22:29.848 --> 22:33.519
I WAS HOPING WE COULD CONNECT ON
THE WHOLE INDIAN-INDIAN THING.

22:33.552 --> 22:35.822
-(music plays faintly)
-OKAY.

22:35.855 --> 22:38.023
THAT IS CLEARLY COMING
FROM COMPUTER SPEAKERS,

22:38.057 --> 22:43.028
AND NOT A RECORD PLAYER.
I MEAN, YOU CAN JUST TELL
BY THE LOW BASS FREQUENCY...

22:43.061 --> 22:45.565
WHOA. WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

22:45.597 --> 22:47.400
IT'S BETTER THAN LETTING
YOU KEEP TALKING.

22:47.432 --> 22:50.068
GIRL, I LIKE YOUR STYLE.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.844
HOW DO YOU NOT THINK
THAT THIS MUSIC IS EMOTIONAL?

22:57.876 --> 23:00.145
-DO YOU NOT HAVE FEELINGS?
-I DO.

23:00.378 --> 23:01.713
LIKE WHEN THERE'S
REAL PROBLEMS.

23:01.748 --> 23:03.415
BUT, LIKE, HOW BIG
CAN YOUR ISSUES BE?

23:03.449 --> 23:05.617
-YOU'RE FROM VERMONT.
-UH, ACTUALLY,

23:05.651 --> 23:08.121
HER MOTHER KILLED
HER FATHER IN SELF-DEFENSE
WHEN SHE WAS A BABY.

23:08.153 --> 23:10.056
AND THEN SHE WENT
TO PRISON, SO...

23:10.088 --> 23:12.491
WHOA! REALLY?
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

23:12.525 --> 23:14.093
I JUST MADE THAT UP.
JUST GO WITH IT.

23:14.126 --> 23:16.695
SO HOW LONG HAVE YOU
AND JESSE BEEN TOGETHER?

23:16.729 --> 23:20.700
UH, WE'RE ACTUALLY
NOT TOGETHER.
PEOPLE ALWAYS THINK WE ARE.

23:20.732 --> 23:23.001
YEAH, WE'RE JUST EACH OTHER'S
GAY BEST FRIENDS, SO...

23:23.035 --> 23:24.737
I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT YOU WERE, UM...

23:24.770 --> 23:27.807
YEAH. NO, I MEAN, THEY DON'T
MAKE US WEAR SIGNS OR ANYTHING.

23:27.839 --> 23:31.076
THEY SHOULD.
THEN WE WOULDN'T CROTCH-BLOCK
EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME

23:31.109 --> 23:32.845
BECAUSE PEOPLE ALWAYS
ASSUME WE'RE TOGETHER.

23:32.878 --> 23:34.680
WELL, AS THE TOKEN
STRAIGHT GIRL HERE,

23:34.713 --> 23:36.115
I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE
TO BE "THE OTHER" NOW.

23:36.148 --> 23:38.917
OH, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE...

23:38.951 --> 23:43.088
YEAH, THEY DON'T MAKE US
WEAR SIGNS OR ANYTHING.

23:43.122 --> 23:45.924
Announcer:
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
FAY WOLF.

23:45.958 --> 23:48.795
(applause)

23:48.827 --> 23:52.664
YOU SHOULD TOTALLY HIT THAT.
FOR BOTH OF US.

23:58.871 --> 24:02.842
(April laughs)

24:02.875 --> 24:04.710
WELL, THANK YOU
FOR WALKING ME HOME.

24:04.743 --> 24:07.145
OF COURSE.
IT'S REALLY DARK,

24:07.180 --> 24:09.915
AND YOUR FRIEND WAS...
OTHERWISE ENGAGED.

24:09.949 --> 24:12.684
(laughs) YEAH, SHE WAS.

24:12.718 --> 24:16.154
GO, BETH. (laughs)

24:16.189 --> 24:17.789
(sighs)

24:20.226 --> 24:21.827
THANKS FOR WALKING ME HOME.

24:21.861 --> 24:23.930
YOU JUST SAID THAT.

24:23.962 --> 24:25.865
WELL, I MEANT IT.
IT WAS VERY SWEET OF YOU.

24:25.897 --> 24:27.834
-YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.
-YES, I DID.

24:27.866 --> 24:30.635
I HAVE THREE SISTERS AT HOME,
AND MY MUM RAISED ME RIGHT.

24:30.670 --> 24:33.705
"MUM!" YOU JUST SAID "MUM!"
THAT'S SO CUTE!

24:33.739 --> 24:35.875
YOU'RE PRETTY CUTE.

24:38.243 --> 24:40.179
-OH, MY GOD, STOP. NO.
-OH, I'M...

24:40.212 --> 24:41.614
I'M SORRY, I JUST...
I THOUGHT...

24:41.646 --> 24:43.615
NO, NO, NO. IT'S, UM...

24:43.648 --> 24:44.817
YOU'RE NOT INTO ME.
THAT'S FINE.

24:44.851 --> 24:47.653
NO, IT'S NOT YOU!
I'M-- I'M ENGAGED.

24:48.988 --> 24:51.190
-REALLY?
-YES.

24:51.223 --> 24:53.625
-YOU NEVER SAID ANYTHING.
-I KNOW, I'M SORRY.

24:53.659 --> 24:56.796
I JUST WANTED
TO ESCAPE FOR THE NIGHT.

24:56.828 --> 24:59.265
OH, MY GOD, THAT SOUNDS
SO HORRIBLE. I'M GONNA...

24:59.498 --> 25:02.634
-I GOTTA GO TO BED.
-ARE YOU REALLY ENGAGED?

25:02.667 --> 25:03.935
YES.

25:03.970 --> 25:06.638
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS
I DIDN'T TELL YOU. GOOD NIGHT.

26:05.163 --> 26:07.732
(phone rings)

26:07.767 --> 26:09.234
OH...

26:09.268 --> 26:11.569
(groans)

26:11.604 --> 26:15.340
-HEY, YOU.
-HI.

26:15.574 --> 26:17.576
I, UM...

26:17.609 --> 26:20.112
I JUST WANTED
TO SAY THAT I MISS YOU.

26:20.145 --> 26:24.150
AW. I DON'T THINK I'VE HEARD
YOU SAY YOU MISSED ME BEFORE.

26:24.182 --> 26:26.751
THAT'S WHAT I GET FOR PICKING
AN INDEPENDENT WOMAN.

26:26.786 --> 26:28.820
I AM INDEPENDENT. IT'S JUST...

26:28.854 --> 26:32.825
...NICE TO FEEL LIKE
I'M YOURS SOMETIMES. YOU KNOW?

26:34.926 --> 26:37.730
(door slams)

26:37.762 --> 26:39.365
I GOTTA GO.

26:40.766 --> 26:42.867
THERE GOES THAT
INDEPENDENCE AGAIN.

26:42.902 --> 26:45.270
HEY. WHAT'S WRONG?

26:45.304 --> 26:47.772
-I MISSED MY CALL.
-OH, MY GOD!
YOUR CONFERENCE CALL.

26:47.807 --> 26:50.643
RIGHT. THE ONE I ASKED YOU
TO MAKE SURE I WAS ON.
THANKS FOR THAT.

26:50.675 --> 26:53.078
I'M SO SORRY. OBVIOUSLY,
I DIDN'T DO THAT ON PURPOSE.

26:53.112 --> 26:55.314
RIGHT. YOU JUST
WEREN'T THINKING ABOUT
THE CONSEQUENCES OF ANYTHING.

26:55.347 --> 26:58.017
LIVING IN THE MOMENT.
GOD. WHERE'S MY PHONE?

26:58.049 --> 27:00.952
OKAY, THERE IT IS.
AND IT'S DEAD. GREAT.

27:00.987 --> 27:03.689
I GUESS I CAN WAIT ANOTHER
THREE MINUTES TILL I GET FIRED.

27:03.722 --> 27:06.025
-YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET FIRED.
-HOW DO YOU KNOW?

27:06.057 --> 27:09.795
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW JACLYN.
ALL RIGHT?
THIS WAS REALLY IMPORTANT.

27:09.828 --> 27:11.730
HOW AM I EVEN
GONNA EXPLAIN THIS?

27:11.763 --> 27:14.133
IF I TELL THE TRUTH,
I LOOK TOTALLY IRRESPONSIBLE.

27:14.165 --> 27:17.737
BUT, I MEAN, I CAN'T JUST
PRETEND THAT MY PHONE
WASN'T WORKING FOR TWO HOURS.

27:17.769 --> 27:21.240
YOU'RE GONNA THINK OF SOMETHING.
YOU ALWAYS DO.

27:21.272 --> 27:23.843
I MEAN, IT WAS
KIND OF WORTH IT, THOUGH.

27:23.875 --> 27:26.345
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
WE HAD THAT MUCH FUN?

27:26.378 --> 27:27.712
REALLY, APRIL?

27:27.747 --> 27:29.647
IF THIS WAS YOUR JOB
ON THE LINE,

27:29.682 --> 27:31.017
YOU WOULD NEVER
HAVE SAID THAT.

27:31.049 --> 27:33.385
I MEAN, WORK WAS ALWAYS
YOUR PRIORITY AT  THE POST.

27:33.419 --> 27:35.788
ALWAYS. AND WHAT, NOW THAT
IT'S MY CAREER, IT'S JUST...

27:35.820 --> 27:38.391
OH, YOU KNOW,
IT'S JUST WHATEVER.

27:38.423 --> 27:41.760
-I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
-YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO.

27:41.794 --> 27:43.695
BETH, WHY ARE YOU
BLAMING ME FOR THIS?

27:43.729 --> 27:44.997
YOU WANTED
TO COME ON THIS TRIP TOO.

27:45.030 --> 27:46.265
WELL, YEAH, FOR YOU!

27:46.298 --> 27:48.800
BUT YOU CAN'T
PUT THIS ALL ON ME!

27:48.834 --> 27:51.302
I'M SORRY, I'M GLAD THAT
YOU CAN JUST GO ON VACATION

27:51.336 --> 27:55.173
AND NOT HAVE TO THINK ABOUT
THE FUTURE, BUT I CAN'T DO THAT.
I DON'T HAVE THAT FREEDOM!

27:55.207 --> 27:59.444
I'M SORRY, YOU THINK THAT
THERE ARE NO CONSEQUENCES
FOR WHAT I'M DOING?

27:59.677 --> 28:01.680
IF I DON'T MAKE
THE RIGHT DECISION

28:01.713 --> 28:03.782
ABOUT THIS CLINICAL TRIAL,
I COULD DIE.

28:03.816 --> 28:06.317
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA TRY
TO COMPETE WITH THAT.

28:06.352 --> 28:10.423
I CAN'T COMPETE WITH MATTERS
OF LIFE AND DEATH, OKAY?

28:10.455 --> 28:13.726
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
IN MY LIFE IS FASHION.

28:13.759 --> 28:15.728
BUT GUESS WHAT?
IT'S STILL MY LIFE.

28:15.760 --> 28:17.730
AND I STILL HAVE
TO KEEP LIVING IT,

28:17.762 --> 28:21.767
REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU CHOOSE
TO DO ABOUT YOUR HEALTH. OKAY?

28:21.800 --> 28:24.303
EVEN IF I LOSE YOU...

28:24.336 --> 28:26.305
-BETH...
-(phone chimes)

28:28.307 --> 28:29.741
EXCUSE ME
WHILE I GO SAVE MY JOB.

28:46.759 --> 28:48.993
ARE YOU ALWAYS THIS NOISY
WHEN YOU GET UP?

28:49.028 --> 28:50.895
I GUESS LAST NIGHT WE
WERE TRYING TO KEEP IT DOWN,

28:50.930 --> 28:53.731
SO YOU'RE MAKING UP
FOR IT NOW.

28:53.766 --> 28:55.366
-YOU'RE DRESSED.
-YEAH, I'M GONNA HEAD OUT.

28:55.401 --> 28:57.769
WAIT, LET ME
MAKE US COFFEE FIRST.

28:57.802 --> 29:00.739
OR BREAKFAST. ANYTHING YOU FIND,
I CAN MAKE IT INTO A FRITTATA.

29:00.772 --> 29:03.741
IT'S MY GREATEST TALENT.
WELL, SECOND GREATEST.

29:03.776 --> 29:05.743
-OH, NO, I DON'T NEED ALL THAT.
-I JUST THOUGHT...

29:05.778 --> 29:07.445
SERIOUSLY, I HAVE
NO EXPECTATIONS.

29:07.480 --> 29:10.048
THIS WAS JUST FUN.
THANKS FOR LAST NIGHT!

29:10.082 --> 29:11.483
GOOD TIMES.

29:11.517 --> 29:13.219
OH! MY SHIRT.

29:14.752 --> 29:17.423
-BYE!
-BYE.

29:22.127 --> 29:23.761
(applause on TV)

29:23.796 --> 29:26.030
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO RUN THOSE TOWELS

29:26.065 --> 29:27.500
THROUGH THE WASH
ONE MORE TIME?

29:27.532 --> 29:29.367
NO, THREE CYCLES IS ENOUGH.

29:29.401 --> 29:34.073
OH! NOTHING IS ENOUGH
WHEN IT'S BEEN USED
TO SOAK UP A BIG PILE OF...

29:34.105 --> 29:38.777
YES, MOM. I KNOW WHAT
THE TOWELS SOAKED UP.
PLEASE DON'T REMIND ME.

29:38.810 --> 29:42.280
AND I KNOW IT'S MY FAULT
FOR NOT GETTING THE TOILET
FIXED EARLIER.

29:42.314 --> 29:44.782
I JUST DIDN'T EXPECT IT
TO EXPLODE LIKE THAT.

29:44.817 --> 29:47.786
WELL, NEITHER DID I,
BUT IT WAS PRETTY HILARIOUS.

29:47.819 --> 29:51.123
YEAH, UP UNTIL THE BILL
CAME FROM THAT PLUMBER.

29:51.156 --> 29:53.325
-I SWEAR, THAT'S A RACKET.
-LOOK.

29:53.358 --> 29:57.429
I'M GONNA SAY THIS JUST ONCE
BECAUSE JEOPARDY
IS BACK ON IN TWO MINUTES.

29:57.462 --> 29:59.798
SOMETHING'S GOT TO GIVE.

29:59.832 --> 30:02.500
YOU CAN'T KEEP WORRYING
OVER EVERY LITTLE EXPENSE

30:02.535 --> 30:06.105
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE REFUSING
TO MAKE BIGGER CHANGES.

30:06.137 --> 30:07.439
WHAT BIG CHANGE
AM I SUPPOSED TO MAKE?

30:07.472 --> 30:09.807
BRENNA SAYS SHE
LOVES CHARTON.

30:09.842 --> 30:12.144
I MEAN, I CAN'T JUST
TAKE THAT AWAY FROM HER NOW.

30:12.178 --> 30:13.578
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
HER COLLEGE FUND?

30:13.811 --> 30:16.147
YOU SAID YOURSELF
THAT CHARTON COSTS

30:16.182 --> 30:17.849
AS MUCH AS COLLEGE
EVERY YEAR.

30:17.883 --> 30:20.519
WELL, USE THAT TO PAY
FOR PRIVATE SCHOOL NOW.

30:20.553 --> 30:22.820
BUT IF I SPEND
THE COLLEGE MONEY...

30:22.855 --> 30:25.324
BRENNA SAID
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GO.

30:25.356 --> 30:27.058
AND I'M SUPPOSED
TO JUST ACCEPT THAT?

30:27.092 --> 30:30.528
WELL, YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO ACCEPT YOUR DAUGHTER
FOR WHO SHE IS, YES.

30:30.563 --> 30:33.499
WELL, IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

30:33.531 --> 30:36.434
WELL, NONE OF THIS
IS SIMPLE.

30:36.468 --> 30:40.506
NEITHER IS RUSSIAN LITERATURE,
BUT I KNOW A LOT ABOUT IT.

30:40.538 --> 30:43.442
(applause on TV)

30:51.616 --> 30:54.586
-Beth: HEY.
-UH... HEY.

30:54.619 --> 30:57.522
I HAVE TO GO HOME.
JACLYN'S REALLY PISSED.
I NEED TO FIX IT.

30:57.556 --> 31:00.593
THAT SUCKS. I'M SORRY.

31:00.625 --> 31:03.095
-GOOD LUCK.
-YOU TOO.

31:03.127 --> 31:07.398
-WITH YOUR DECISIONS.
-THANKS.

31:07.432 --> 31:10.134
HAVE A SAFE FLIGHT.

31:53.479 --> 31:57.148
-(indistinct chatter on TV)
-LET ME CALL YOU BACK.

31:57.182 --> 31:59.585
DUDE, LAST NIGHT?
STOP IT!

31:59.617 --> 32:02.488
-TOP TEN NIGHTS OF MY LIFE.
-SO YOU AND JULIA HAD FUN, HUH?

32:02.520 --> 32:04.155
-DO YOU SEE ME
SMILING RIGHT NOW?
-I DO.

32:04.189 --> 32:06.125
BUT UNDER THAT SMILE,
DO YOU SEE A HINT
OF ME HATING MYSELF?

32:06.157 --> 32:07.459
ACTUALLY, NO. NOT TODAY.

32:07.492 --> 32:09.461
-THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAD FUN.
-NICE.

32:09.494 --> 32:11.696
THE WHOLE DAY
WAS JUST SO BOMB.

32:11.930 --> 32:15.567
WE SERIOUSLY NEED A NICKNAME
FOR THE AWESOME THAT HAPPENS
WHEN WE GO OUT TOGETHER.

32:15.601 --> 32:18.304
"DANINIC?" HUH?
SO WHAT'S NEXT?

32:18.336 --> 32:20.204
I HEARD THERE'S
CHEAP VEGAS FLIGHTS.
WANNA PLAN A WEEKEND?

32:20.239 --> 32:22.641
-ROUND TWO?
-I DON'T KNOW.

32:22.674 --> 32:25.544
WELL, THE OTHER OPTION WAS
"DONNY," BUT THAT SOUNDS
LIKE AN ACTUAL MAN'S NAME.

32:25.576 --> 32:30.481
-A VERY LAME MAN.
-NO, I JUST DON'T THINK I WANT
TO KEEP GOING OUT LIKE THAT.

32:30.516 --> 32:33.451
-BUT WE JUST GOT STARTED.
-THAT'S THE THING, I DIDN'T.

32:33.484 --> 32:35.287
I USED TO HAVE NIGHTS
LIKE THAT ALL THE TIME.

32:35.320 --> 32:36.721
AND NOW I FEEL LIKE I WANT
TO HAVE SOMETHING MORE

32:36.954 --> 32:39.290
TO SHOW FOR MYSELF
THAN JUST A PILE OF CHIPS.

32:39.325 --> 32:42.560
I WANT TO WAKE UP NEXT
TO A GIRL I ACTUALLY KNOW.
YOU KNOW?

32:42.594 --> 32:46.164
NO, THAT SOUNDS ANNOYING.

32:51.569 --> 32:55.207
AND, FORD, JUST A REMINDER,
YOUR MOTIVATION IN THIS SCENE

32:55.240 --> 32:58.711
IS TO PROVE TO YOURSELF
THAT YOU'RE STILL ATTRACTIVE
TO YOUR BOYFRIEND.

32:58.743 --> 33:00.578
HE HASN'T BEEN PAYING YOU
ENOUGH ATTENTION LATELY,

33:00.612 --> 33:02.314
AND YOUR WHOLE SELF-ESTEEM
DEPENDS ON IT.

33:02.347 --> 33:04.482
SO I'M JUST
SUPER ANTI-FEMINIST.

33:04.516 --> 33:06.451
NO. NO, NO.

33:06.484 --> 33:10.288
YOU'RE JUST A RELATABLE GIRL
WITH INSECURITIES.

33:10.321 --> 33:13.392
PRETEND LIKE YOU
HAVE INSECURITIES.
IT'S CALLED ACTING.

33:13.424 --> 33:15.461
OKAY, AND HUNTER,
YOU'RE TOTALLY DISTRACTED.

33:15.493 --> 33:18.630
YOU CANNOT STOP THINKING
ABOUT YOUR LAST ONE-ON-ONE
SOCCER PRACTICE WITH NIGEL.

33:18.663 --> 33:21.432
YO, TIME OUT. CAN WE PICK
A LESS LAME NAME THAN NIGEL?

33:21.467 --> 33:23.669
IT'S TOO LATE.
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED
IN THE TABLE READ.

33:23.701 --> 33:26.204
WE CAN'T KEEP WASTING TIME
LIKE THIS, GUYS.

33:26.238 --> 33:30.576
OKAY. AND, FORD, REMEMBER,
REALLY INSECURE, REALLY TIMID.

33:32.176 --> 33:35.213
OKAY. AND... ACTION.

33:39.183 --> 33:40.652
NO, FORD, CUT.

33:40.685 --> 33:43.221
-CUT, FORD, NO!
-SORRY.

33:43.255 --> 33:46.157
-SORRY. I'M A METHOD ACTRESS.
-THAT'S NOT WHAT THAT MEANS.

33:46.191 --> 33:49.560
HUNTER, REMEMBER,
YOU'RE NOT ATTRACTED
TO HER IN THIS SCENE.

33:49.595 --> 33:52.730
HE'S NOT A GOOD ENOUGH
ACTOR TO SELL THAT.
LIKE, THAT'S THE ISSUE HERE.

33:52.765 --> 33:54.500
DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF.
YOU'RE NOT MY TYPE.

33:54.532 --> 33:58.636
REALLY? 'CAUSE I, UM,
FELT OTHERWISE.

33:58.670 --> 34:00.672
WHATEVER, DUDE.
IT'S JUST A BIOLOGICAL RESPONSE.

34:00.705 --> 34:04.476
OKAY, GUYS. COME ON,
WE'RE NEVER GONNA FINISH THIS.
WE'RE GOING AGAIN.

34:04.509 --> 34:07.512
-READY WHEN YOU ARE.
-OKAY.

34:07.546 --> 34:10.282
-AND...
-OH, WAIT. HOLD ON. ONE SECOND.

34:13.284 --> 34:14.719
REALLY?

34:23.728 --> 34:27.298
HONEY! WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HOME SO EARLY?

34:27.331 --> 34:30.668
OH, MY GOSH! DID YOU HAVE
THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE?

34:30.702 --> 34:34.606
ARE YOU READY TO START
A CLINICAL TRIAL?

34:34.639 --> 34:36.442
(sobs)

34:36.474 --> 34:41.746
-HONEY! OH...
-(sobbing)

34:41.780 --> 34:44.615
MOM...

34:50.856 --> 34:54.659
-I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.
-WELL, THAT'S WHAT
DR. HAMBURG'S FOR.

34:54.693 --> 34:57.329
YEAH, BUT AT THE END
OF THE DAY,

34:57.362 --> 35:00.766
ALL THESE HUGE CHOICES
ARE STILL UP TO ME.

35:00.798 --> 35:03.768
MY HEALTH, MARRYING LEO.

35:03.802 --> 35:06.538
WELL, YOU CAN
ALWAYS WAIT ON THAT.

35:06.572 --> 35:09.407
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
THINK ABOUT IT SOME MORE.

35:09.440 --> 35:11.844
-MOM.
-FINE. I AM TOTALLY SUPPORTIVE

35:11.876 --> 35:13.612
OF YOU AND YOUR
WHIRLWIND MARRIAGE.

35:13.644 --> 35:15.614
(both chuckle)

35:15.646 --> 35:18.483
OH, AND THAT FIGHT
WITH BETH, IT SUCKED.

35:18.516 --> 35:22.554
WHAT IF IT'S A SIGN
THAT WE CAN'T RELATE
TO EACH OTHER ANYMORE?

35:22.588 --> 35:27.425
WELL, LOOKIT, THIS IS THE THING
ABOUT GROWING UP.

35:27.458 --> 35:30.362
THERE COMES A POINT IN YOUR
ADULT LIFE WHEN YOU REALIZE

35:30.394 --> 35:35.367
THAT YOU'RE REALLY THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN DECIDE HOW YOU LIVE.

35:35.400 --> 35:38.436
AND THAT'S A LOT OF POWER.

35:38.469 --> 35:39.637
WHICH IS GOOD.

35:39.670 --> 35:42.206
IT'S ALSO REALLY SCARY.

35:42.240 --> 35:46.577
YOU KNOW, AS VOLTAIRE SAID,
"WITH GREAT POWER
COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY."

35:46.612 --> 35:48.179
THAT'S FROM  SPIDER-MAN.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.782
-I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S VOLTAIRE.
-(chuckles)

35:51.817 --> 35:55.152
AND WITH BETH,
THAT'S JUST GROWING PAINS,

35:55.186 --> 35:58.356
WHICH MAKES SENSE.
YOU GUYS ARE CHANGING SO MUCH.

35:58.389 --> 36:01.460
I FEEL LIKE I'M BASICALLY
A DIFFERENT PERSON.

36:01.492 --> 36:05.396
I MEAN, I THOUGHT
FOR SURE I'D BE

36:05.429 --> 36:09.534
LIVING IN NEW YORK,
WORKING FOR  THE TIMES,
AND TRAVELING THE WORLD.

36:09.568 --> 36:12.371
I GUESS THAT'S THE THING.
EVERYTHING CHANGES,

36:12.403 --> 36:14.539
AND ALL YOU CAN DO IS ADAPT.

36:14.572 --> 36:17.643
LIKE, SOMETIMES YOU'RE ABOUT
TO MAKE A SUPER HEALTHY DINNER

36:17.675 --> 36:20.311
AND YOUR DAUGHTER COMES IN
AND FORCES YOU TO ORDER PIZZA.

36:20.344 --> 36:23.548
(chuckles) THAT WAS
ONE REALLY EASY DECISION.

36:23.581 --> 36:26.251
(laughs)

36:30.956 --> 36:32.824
Beth on voicemail:  It's Beth.
Sorry I screened your call.

36:32.858 --> 36:34.793
-It may or may not be personal.
-(beep)

36:34.826 --> 36:37.528
HEY. IT'S ME.

36:37.563 --> 36:41.599
I JUST WANTED TO SAY
I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED ON THE TRIP.

36:41.632 --> 36:44.936
I WASN'T THINKING,
OR I WASN'T THINKING ABOUT YOU.

36:44.969 --> 36:48.606
I KNOW YOU FEEL LIKE
I LOOK DOWN ON YOUR CAREER,

36:48.639 --> 36:50.275
BUT THAT IS SO NOT TRUE.

36:50.309 --> 36:53.811
YOU ARE KILLING IT AT WORK
AND AT LIFE.

36:53.844 --> 36:56.547
AND I REALIZE JUST
HOW BRAVE YOU ARE

36:56.581 --> 36:58.416
FOR ALWAYS DOING THAT
SO FEARLESSLY.

36:58.449 --> 37:01.320
AND I WANNA DO THAT NOW.
SO IF YOU WANT...

37:21.505 --> 37:22.541
COME IN.

37:24.543 --> 37:28.646
WHOA. YOU'RE GETTING
AN EARLY START.

37:28.679 --> 37:31.717
YEAH, I'M GONNA GO MEET FORD
TO SHOOT OUR LAST SCENE.

37:31.750 --> 37:34.652
SHE'S REALLY EXCITED
ABOUT THE PARTIAL NUDITY.

37:34.686 --> 37:36.521
YEAH, I'M SURE.

37:38.623 --> 37:41.994
BRENNA, YOU KNOW THAT I'VE
ALWAYS TRIED TO PROTECT YOU

37:42.027 --> 37:46.632
FROM HAVING TO WORRY
ABOUT ADULT ISSUES,
LIKE FAMILY FINANCES.

37:46.664 --> 37:49.800
BUT YOU'RE 17
AND I THINK THAT IT'S TIME

37:49.835 --> 37:51.836
THAT I STARTED TREATING YOU
LIKE MORE OF AN ADULT.

37:51.869 --> 37:53.271
RIGHT, OKAY.

37:53.304 --> 37:54.905
AND PART OF THAT
HAS TO DO

37:54.940 --> 37:57.675
WITH LETTING YOU IN ON
WHAT I'M DEALING WITH.

37:57.708 --> 38:01.313
CAN YOU PLEASE
JUST STOP FOR A SECOND,

38:01.346 --> 38:04.650
-AND SIT DOWN?
-OKAY.

38:08.452 --> 38:11.956
UM, I'M SURE YOU
HAVE SOME AWARENESS

38:11.989 --> 38:15.994
OF THE FACT THAT APRIL'S
MEDICAL EXPENSES ARE HIGH,

38:16.027 --> 38:18.295
AND PRIVATE SCHOOL
IS A LOT TOO.

38:18.329 --> 38:22.567
BUT, UH, I DON'T HAVE
THE OPTION TO NOT PAY
FOR APRIL'S HEALTHCARE.

38:22.601 --> 38:25.570
SO IT RECENTLY
BECAME OBVIOUS TO ME

38:25.603 --> 38:29.840
THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO MAKE ANOTHER SACRIFICE,
AS A FAMILY...

38:29.875 --> 38:31.909
-NO.
-(sighs) BRENNA...

38:31.943 --> 38:34.846
-YOU'RE MAKING ME
LEAVE CHARTON?
-I DON'T WANT TO.

38:34.880 --> 38:37.581
BELIEVE ME, THIS IS
THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO.

38:37.615 --> 38:41.519
SO YOU JUST, YOU GO AHEAD
AND MAKE THIS DECISION
WITHOUT EVEN ASKING ME?

38:41.552 --> 38:45.523
WAIT, NO, YOU DID ASK ME,
AND I TOLD YOU
THAT I LOVE SCHOOL!

38:45.556 --> 38:48.693
SO WHY WOULD YOU ASK ME
IF YOU DIDN'T EVEN
CARE ABOUT MY ANSWER?

38:48.726 --> 38:50.795
I DID CARE.
IT'S JUST THAT...

38:50.829 --> 38:53.465
I WAS WEIGHING MY OPTIONS.
BRENNA, WE JUST

38:53.498 --> 38:56.333
-DON'T HAVE THE SAVINGS.
-SO SELL THE HOUSE.

38:56.367 --> 39:00.706
OH, COME ON. REALLY?
YOU EXPECT ME TO UPROOT
THE ENTIRE FAMILY RIGHT NOW?

39:00.739 --> 39:04.809
-WHAT ABOUT MY COLLEGE FUND?
-YOU'RE NOT EVEN AN ADULT YET.

39:04.842 --> 39:07.079
OKAY, WAIT,
SO NOW I'M NOT AN ADULT?

39:07.112 --> 39:11.083
OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, YOU
MIGHT CHANGE YOUR MIND ABOUT...

39:11.115 --> 39:13.617
SO YOU STILL THINK
THAT I'M GOING TO COLLEGE,

39:13.652 --> 39:16.454
AFTER I TOLD YOU
A MILLION TIMES
THAT I DON'T WANT TO GO!

39:16.487 --> 39:17.822
PLEASE, LET ME FINISH.

39:17.856 --> 39:21.559
EVEN IF YOU DON'T USE
THAT MONEY FOR COLLEGE,

39:21.592 --> 39:24.028
I WANT YOU TO HAVE
CHOICES IN YOUR LIFE.

39:24.061 --> 39:26.398
YOU'RE GONNA CHANGE
SO MUCH BETWEEN NOW

39:26.431 --> 39:28.432
AND THE TIME
YOU'RE APRIL'S AGE.

39:28.467 --> 39:32.704
WHAT IF YOU WANT TO TRAVEL?
WHAT IF YOU WANT TO MAKE
MORE OF YOUR SHORT FILMS?

39:32.737 --> 39:35.574
IT'S MY JOB TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU HAVE THE RESOURCES

39:35.606 --> 39:40.144
-TO GROW AND CHANGE.
-WHATEVER! ALL I DO IS CHANGE!

39:40.378 --> 39:42.547
BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS MAKE ME!

39:42.581 --> 39:45.650
YOU TOOK ME OUT OF PUBLIC SCHOOL
AND MADE ME GO TO A PREP SCHOOL,

39:45.684 --> 39:47.918
WHERE I DIDN'T FIT IN
WITH ANYONE,

39:47.952 --> 39:49.387
AND NOW I FINALLY DO,

39:49.420 --> 39:51.989
AND YOU'RE MAKING ME
CHANGE MY WHOLE LIFE AGAIN!

39:52.023 --> 39:56.695
-IT'S NOT FAIR.
-I KNOW, BRENNA, BUT...

39:56.728 --> 39:58.563
-CAN YOU JUST...
-NO, I HAVE TO GO.

39:58.597 --> 40:01.099
I HAVE TO GO MEET FORD
AND TELL HER THAT I PROBABLY

40:01.132 --> 40:02.867
CAN'T EVEN ENTER
THIS FILM FESTIVAL.

40:02.900 --> 40:04.702
SO THANKS FOR THAT TOO.

40:12.878 --> 40:16.581
-Beth: THEY'RE OVERREACTING.
-YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, BETH.

40:16.614 --> 40:19.951
-THE BOOK
IS JUST REALLY DISTURBING.
-WHY?

40:19.985 --> 40:21.686
WELL, HE CALLS IT A NOVEL,

40:21.719 --> 40:24.889
BUT SO MUCH OF IT
IS JUST HIS LIFE.

40:24.922 --> 40:26.724
IT'S ABOUT A MAN
WITH TWO FAMILIES.

40:26.757 --> 40:28.126
A WIFE AND TWO DAUGHTERS
IN RHODE ISLAND

40:28.159 --> 40:30.795
AND A MISTRESS AND BASTARD
DAUGHTER IN SOUTH CAROLINA.

40:30.829 --> 40:33.498
WELL, I MEAN, A LOT OF WRITERS
WRITE ABOUT WHAT THEY KNOW.

40:33.532 --> 40:36.534
IF ANYTHING, IT
JUST SOUNDS LIKE YOUR DAD
WASN'T THAT CREATIVE THIS TIME.

40:36.568 --> 40:39.137
YOU KNOW? HE DIDN'T BOTHER
TO CHANGE THE DETAILS THAT MUCH.

40:39.170 --> 40:43.175
BUT IF THAT'S THE CASE,
IT'S EVEN CREEPIER.

40:43.775 --> 40:44.909
IN THE BOOK,

40:44.943 --> 40:46.911
HE TALKS ABOUT HOW HE'S
PLANNED HIS OWN DEATH.

40:46.945 --> 40:50.514
(laughs) IT'S FICTION.

40:50.548 --> 40:52.449
BUT WHAT IF IT'S NOT?

40:55.987 --> 40:58.155
HEY, HOW WERE THE TROPICS?
WOW, YOU GOT A TAN!

40:58.190 --> 40:59.925
YEAH, I DIDN'T
WEAR ENOUGH SUNSCREEN.

40:59.958 --> 41:01.559
BUT WHAT'S MORE CANCER
AT THIS POINT?

41:01.592 --> 41:03.594
MM. FUNNY CAUSE IT'S TRUE.

41:03.628 --> 41:06.030
SO I SPOKE TO THE COMPANY
THAT RUNS THE SELKIN TRIAL
AND HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.

41:06.063 --> 41:07.599
-FIRST THING...
-OKAY, WAIT. I, UM,

41:07.632 --> 41:09.701
ACTUALLY FOUND
ANOTHER ONE ONLINE

41:09.733 --> 41:12.170
THAT I WANT TO DO. IT'S CALLED
THE LEITENBERG TRIAL.

41:12.204 --> 41:15.539
I KNOW WE HAVEN'T TALKED
ABOUT IT, AND IT'S
MUCH MORE INNOVATIVE,

41:15.574 --> 41:18.577
BUT I WANT TO ATTACK THIS
AS AGGRESSIVELY AS WE CAN.

41:18.610 --> 41:19.978
I GET THAT.

41:20.010 --> 41:23.949
I JUST WOULD PREFER
A LATER-PHASE TRIAL
AT THIS POINT.

41:23.981 --> 41:26.550
LEITENBERG DOESN'T HAVE
THE SAME TRACK RECORD
AND THE SIDE EFFECTS COULD BE...

41:26.585 --> 41:27.952
I KNOW.
I'VE READ ALL ABOUT IT.

41:27.985 --> 41:30.688
AND I TOTALLY
RESPECT YOUR OPINION,

41:31.722 --> 41:33.992
BUT I KNOW THIS
IS WHAT I WANT TO DO.

41:39.197 --> 41:41.733
WELL, THEN THAT'S
WHAT WE'LL DO.

41:41.766 --> 41:43.768
WE'LL GET YOUR BLOOD COUNTS
AND GET YOU ON THAT LIST.
