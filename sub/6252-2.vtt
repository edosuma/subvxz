WEBVTT

00:04.618 --> 00:06.786
We're lost.
We're totally lost.

00:06.837 --> 00:08.888
We're fine, Tracey.

00:08.956 --> 00:11.224
I told you
hiking was crazy.

00:11.292 --> 00:13.393
We should have just
bought plaid shirts

00:13.460 --> 00:14.894
and gone to a resort.

00:14.962 --> 00:16.980
We'll hit the trail as long
as we keep heading west,

00:17.064 --> 00:18.148
and we're heading west!

00:18.232 --> 00:20.233
You don't know that, Michael.
Tracey,

00:20.301 --> 00:22.969
that's the sun, so that's South
and that's west!

00:23.020 --> 00:24.821
That's what you <i>say.</i>
It's not
my opinion.

00:24.905 --> 00:28.325
It has to do with
the position of the sun!
Oh, please,

00:28.409 --> 00:30.944
this whole direction thing
is totally arbitrary!

00:30.995 --> 00:32.195
We're lost!

00:32.280 --> 00:33.830
And we're gonna die
out here, and they're

00:33.914 --> 00:36.249
gonna find our bones
one day, and I hate you!
You know what?

00:36.317 --> 00:37.817
Just follow me,
or they will find your bones,

00:37.868 --> 00:38.835
because <i>I'll</i> kill you.

00:38.919 --> 00:40.453
Now, come on!

00:43.541 --> 00:44.591
Great.

00:44.658 --> 00:47.594
Oh, God, it's
starting to rain?!

00:47.661 --> 00:49.162
Look, there's a cave over there.

00:49.213 --> 00:50.180
A cave?
Look,

00:50.264 --> 00:53.049
if you don't like it,
then stay out here.

00:54.468 --> 00:57.804
Well, don't leave me all alone!

01:03.728 --> 01:07.314
Oh, we are so
totally gonna die.

01:07.365 --> 01:08.782
You <i>bastard.</i>

01:08.849 --> 01:10.683
We are not gonna die!

01:10.735 --> 01:12.736
Says <i>you.</i>

01:17.308 --> 01:18.591
Oh, my God.

01:18.659 --> 01:21.127
We're totally gonna die!

01:28.586 --> 01:31.504
So, have you talked to Hannah
since you got back?

01:31.555 --> 01:32.806
Oh, yeah. Couple times.

01:32.873 --> 01:34.808
She said she's waiting
for her new assignment,

01:34.875 --> 01:37.060
probably Southern Iraq.
I find it anomalous

01:37.144 --> 01:39.145
that you would leave her
since you believe

01:39.213 --> 01:41.181
so emphatically in
the mythic powers of love.

01:41.232 --> 01:43.400
Do you understand
what she's saying?
Just nod.

01:43.484 --> 01:46.319
Well, I'm just saying that
you wanted to fall in love

01:46.387 --> 01:48.154
and you did in Afghanistan.

01:48.222 --> 01:50.357
You were in Afghanistan?
Yeah, I just got back.

01:50.408 --> 01:53.910
Ah. I was stationed as a
staff sergeant in Kandahar.

01:53.994 --> 01:55.362
Served with my
brother in '04.
I'm a...

01:55.413 --> 01:56.529
well, I <i>was</i> a Ranger.

01:56.580 --> 01:57.947
Oh, you guys
were awesome.

01:58.032 --> 02:00.083
Yeah.
My brother didn't make it back.

02:00.167 --> 02:01.918
Oh. Sorry.

02:02.002 --> 02:03.119
It was worse

02:03.204 --> 02:04.671
for his wife and kid.

02:04.738 --> 02:06.506
I take care of her now.

02:06.573 --> 02:08.241
Sorry, I didn't mean
to bring us down.

02:08.292 --> 02:10.410
You were saying something
about a woman you left behind?

02:10.461 --> 02:13.012
Oh, I didn't leave her behind;
it was her decision to stay.

02:13.080 --> 02:14.547
Well, maybe you didn't
really love her.

02:14.598 --> 02:16.349
No, I...
I do love her. I do.

02:16.417 --> 02:17.684
So, is this
the cave entrance?

02:17.751 --> 02:18.935
This is it.

02:20.137 --> 02:21.771
This one is a male,

02:21.856 --> 02:25.258
late 20s, early 30s.

02:25.309 --> 02:27.477
This is a female,
same approximate age.

02:27.561 --> 02:29.979
PARK RANGER: Kind of sad
the way they're holding
each other, right?

02:30.064 --> 02:31.231
Yeah, what happened there,
Bones?

02:31.282 --> 02:32.649
Well, multiple fractures,

02:32.733 --> 02:35.034
more severe on the female.

02:35.102 --> 02:36.403
It appears they've
been bludgeoned.

02:36.454 --> 02:39.489
Oh. It's, like, he...
he couldn't let her go.

02:39.573 --> 02:41.074
It would appear that way.

02:41.125 --> 02:42.625
I wouldn't make any comparisons

02:42.710 --> 02:44.077
with <i>your</i> current situation.

02:44.128 --> 02:46.246
Oh, uh, thanks... for that.
Thank you.

02:46.313 --> 02:47.664
Maggots and
other insect activity

02:47.748 --> 02:50.216
seem to have cleaned
the bodies of tissue.

02:50.284 --> 02:52.919
Some of the bone
of the skull as well.

02:52.970 --> 02:55.054
Yeah, that'll happen
pretty fast out here.

02:55.122 --> 02:57.757
Well, it makes determining
time of death more difficult.

02:57.808 --> 02:59.175
I'll need
the remains transported

02:59.260 --> 03:01.561
back to the Jeffersonian,
along with the rocks

03:01.628 --> 03:03.313
and the surrounding soil.
Great. Maybe you can lead

03:03.397 --> 03:05.515
the forensics team, Sarge,
all right, so nobody gets lost.

03:05.599 --> 03:06.632
Yeah.
All right,
let's go.

03:06.684 --> 03:08.468
Careful of your head.
Yeah. All right.

03:12.590 --> 03:13.907
Great. So, the
forensics team says

03:13.974 --> 03:16.526
the remains should be at the lab
in a couple of hours.

03:16.610 --> 03:19.329
It seems like we were never
away from each other,

03:19.413 --> 03:20.530
doesn't it?
Yeah.

03:20.614 --> 03:22.282
You okay with that?
Of course.

03:22.333 --> 03:23.616
Why?
Why?

03:23.667 --> 03:25.485
Because seven months ago,
you said you...

03:25.536 --> 03:28.288
didn't want to be surrounded by,
you know, crime and death

03:28.339 --> 03:30.423
and sadness.
Well, I needed some time

03:30.491 --> 03:34.427
to rationally assess the best
use of my considerable skills.

03:34.495 --> 03:36.563
Factoring in that we
have such a strong

03:36.630 --> 03:38.348
and mutually beneficial
relationship,

03:38.432 --> 03:39.933
I concluded that...

03:40.000 --> 03:42.101
I could be most useful
solving crimes.

03:42.169 --> 03:43.970
Right. So you're happy
to be working together?

03:44.038 --> 03:46.039
That's what I just said.
Great.

03:46.106 --> 03:47.357
Me, too.

03:47.424 --> 03:49.309
So...

03:49.360 --> 03:51.110
do you miss her?

03:51.178 --> 03:53.646
Yeah, of course I do.

03:53.697 --> 03:56.282
Well, if there's anything
that I can do...

03:56.350 --> 03:58.551
You know, I didn't leave Hannah.

03:58.619 --> 04:01.621
You know, I had to come
back here because of Parker.

04:01.688 --> 04:03.206
I know.
I couldn't
ask her to leave

04:03.290 --> 04:05.358
any more than
she could get me to stay.

04:06.710 --> 04:08.861
I-I'm sorry I brought it up.

04:10.130 --> 04:12.165
Oh, my God.

04:15.369 --> 04:17.587
Hannah. Hey.

04:17.671 --> 04:19.088
What are you doing here?

04:19.173 --> 04:20.807
We can talk
in a minute.

04:20.874 --> 04:22.175
Mm.

04:24.228 --> 04:27.514
I put in a request
to be assigned to the
Washington press corps.

04:27.565 --> 04:29.682
Something you said
you'd never do.
Well, that was

04:29.733 --> 04:32.101
before I realized how much
I hated waking up alone.

04:34.355 --> 04:36.523
Hello.

04:38.025 --> 04:38.942
I'm...

04:39.026 --> 04:40.026
Temperance Brennan.

04:40.077 --> 04:41.894
Ah. I've heard a lot about you.

04:41.946 --> 04:42.996
Hannah Burley.

04:43.063 --> 04:44.664
I assumed.

04:44.731 --> 04:46.332
Yes.

05:23.434 --> 05:25.301
I was passed over
for a promotion in Chicago,

05:25.352 --> 05:27.053
and when I heard
Dr. Brennan was back,

05:27.137 --> 05:29.088
I just jumped at the chance
to work here again.

05:29.156 --> 05:30.139
That shows
excellent judgment.

05:30.190 --> 05:31.524
Most of the fractures

05:31.608 --> 05:34.394
on the female are localized
to the left posterior side.

05:34.461 --> 05:35.728
Yeah, there are

05:35.813 --> 05:37.313
multiple breaks
in the femur,

05:37.381 --> 05:39.399
pelvis, vertebrae...

05:39.483 --> 05:40.983
So, what was it like
to meet Hannah?

05:41.051 --> 05:42.852
Oh, she seems... very pleasant

05:42.903 --> 05:44.036
and...

05:44.121 --> 05:45.905
attractive.
Her face fits

05:45.989 --> 05:48.374
comfortably within
the golden ratio.

05:48.459 --> 05:50.159
So you guys did math together?

05:50.227 --> 05:53.195
No, the golden ratio is a
formula that determines beauty.

05:53.247 --> 05:55.214
One to 1.618.

05:55.299 --> 05:57.200
For instance, the
width of the mouth

05:57.267 --> 05:59.719
to the width
of the cheek...
So she's hot.

05:59.803 --> 06:01.036
I see some, uh,

06:01.088 --> 06:02.204
particulates here,
Dr. Hodgins.

06:02.256 --> 06:04.390
You know, if we still
care about finding out

06:04.475 --> 06:06.225
what happened
to these poor people.

06:06.310 --> 06:09.262
I just assumed that when you
guys got back from your trip,
you'd be a real couple.

06:09.346 --> 06:10.546
We were never a couple.

06:10.597 --> 06:12.882
Dr. Saroyan,
you assured me that you

06:12.933 --> 06:15.351
would try to keep
this workplace professional.
And I will,

06:15.419 --> 06:17.403
Dr. Edison.
No, no, no.

06:17.488 --> 06:19.522
You <i>were</i> a couple.

06:19.573 --> 06:21.107
You just weren't having sex.

06:21.191 --> 06:22.442
Were you jealous?

06:22.526 --> 06:24.277
Of course not.
I'm happy for Booth.

06:24.361 --> 06:25.778
Why would I be jealous?

06:25.863 --> 06:27.263
Because it's obvious
you and Agent Booth

06:27.331 --> 06:28.314
were attracted to each other.

06:28.382 --> 06:30.199
I mean, a blind man
could see that.

06:30.250 --> 06:31.751
I just couldn't understand
why you two

06:31.835 --> 06:33.503
just didn't rip
each other's clothes off.

06:33.570 --> 06:37.190
I mean, just get
all butt-naked and...

06:37.257 --> 06:39.959
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God. Uh...

06:40.043 --> 06:41.561
I'm-I'm sorry.

06:41.628 --> 06:42.628
Uh, I...

06:42.713 --> 06:44.030
It just popped
out, okay?

06:44.097 --> 06:45.932
You guys weren't focusing.
Dude.

06:45.999 --> 06:47.917
A little self-control?

06:56.143 --> 06:59.612
I hitched a ride on a C-130
coming back from Baghdad.
Oh. Oh.

06:59.696 --> 07:01.113
We got fired on twice.

07:01.198 --> 07:03.816
I was sitting next
to some guy from A.P.

07:03.901 --> 07:06.402
who wet his
brand-new fatigues.

07:06.453 --> 07:08.054
I just, I can't
believe you're here.

07:08.121 --> 07:09.271
It's so strange.

07:09.323 --> 07:11.073
Truthfully, baby,
neither can I.
So,

07:11.124 --> 07:12.708
are you sure that
the press corps

07:12.776 --> 07:14.293
is gonna be exciting
enough for you?

07:14.378 --> 07:15.945
I'll make sure it is.

07:15.996 --> 07:17.663
God, I missed you.

07:18.665 --> 07:20.132
Mm.

07:20.217 --> 07:21.584
I wish I could take
some time off,

07:21.635 --> 07:22.668
but we're just
in the middle

07:22.753 --> 07:24.453
of a double homicide.
Forget it.

07:24.521 --> 07:26.973
We have all the time
in the world now.

07:27.040 --> 07:29.291
They put me up
at the Dupont Hotel.

07:29.343 --> 07:30.810
Call me when you're free.

07:30.894 --> 07:32.228
Dupont.
Place is a dump.

07:32.295 --> 07:33.629
All right, listen,

07:33.680 --> 07:35.481
stop by later, okay?

07:35.566 --> 07:36.849
Here's my key
to my place.

07:36.934 --> 07:38.851
What you got to do
is, you got to just

07:38.936 --> 07:40.603
get it in there and you
got to move it left

07:40.671 --> 07:42.939
to right, and when you
hear the lock pop,

07:43.006 --> 07:44.440
Yeah?
just give it a kick.

07:44.491 --> 07:46.075
That sounds filthy.

07:51.331 --> 07:52.481
I should go.

07:52.533 --> 07:53.783
See you later.

07:53.834 --> 07:55.184
Sorry, is this a bad time?

07:55.252 --> 07:57.253
No, come on in.
Come on in. Come in.

07:57.320 --> 07:58.654
How can
I help you?

07:58.722 --> 08:00.373
Thought your girl
was still in Afghanistan.

08:00.457 --> 08:02.491
Ah, she surprised me.

08:02.543 --> 08:03.676
That explains the grin.
Mm.

08:03.760 --> 08:04.844
Um, I'll make this quick.

08:04.928 --> 08:07.013
Um, a guy I work with
told me about

08:07.097 --> 08:09.015
another murder out there
almost ten years ago.

08:09.082 --> 08:11.117
Some squatter
who lived out in the woods,

08:11.184 --> 08:12.635
he went after someone
that he thought was trespassing.

08:12.703 --> 08:14.170
On federal land?
Yeah, well, the squatter

08:14.238 --> 08:16.355
didn't recognize
the federal government.

08:16.423 --> 08:18.407
Anyway, he beat this guy
so bad, he died.

08:18.475 --> 08:21.176
I just wanted to give you
a copy of the original file.

08:21.228 --> 08:23.412
Why didn't you just call me?
Yeah, I could've.

08:23.480 --> 08:25.665
When I heard we were both combat
vets, I guess I wanted in

08:25.732 --> 08:27.900
on a little bit more action
than I get out in the park.

08:27.985 --> 08:29.902
You know, look, we both
have our jurisdictions.

08:29.987 --> 08:31.237
I can't authorize you to...

08:31.321 --> 08:34.323
No, I just thought that...

08:34.374 --> 08:37.192
No, I-I understand,
you're right. Sorry.

08:37.244 --> 08:38.410
Tell you what,

08:38.495 --> 08:41.330
when I'm in the park,
you're my guy.

08:41.398 --> 08:43.215
Thanks.

08:43.299 --> 08:45.367
Thanks for this.

08:45.419 --> 08:46.485
It's just that, uh...

08:46.553 --> 08:48.004
I always felt
there was

08:48.055 --> 08:50.790
something more I could've done
for my brother, and...

08:50.857 --> 08:53.042
maybe he'd still be here.

08:54.611 --> 08:56.679
Guess I'm still
just trying to do

08:56.730 --> 08:58.764
that little something extra
is all.

08:58.849 --> 09:01.684
We always feel that way
when we lose someone.

09:01.752 --> 09:04.403
Yeah.

09:04.488 --> 09:06.355
Hey, tell you what,
while you're here,

09:06.423 --> 09:08.274
why don't you go and
pick up an application.

09:08.342 --> 09:10.109
The bureau's always looking
for a few good men,

09:10.177 --> 09:11.894
and, I mean, with
your service record...

09:11.945 --> 09:14.430
Tell Jenny in Personnel
that I sent you.

09:14.498 --> 09:17.116
I will. Thanks.

09:33.884 --> 09:35.851
Okay, that's gross.

09:35.919 --> 09:39.655
Vacuuming their noses--
or what used to be their noses--

09:39.723 --> 09:41.590
it's fun.
Want to help?

09:41.642 --> 09:44.259
You are not playing with our
children without supervision.

09:44.311 --> 09:46.028
I'm retrieving pollen
that would've been present

09:46.096 --> 09:47.596
when they took
their last breath.

09:47.648 --> 09:48.764
And I can match that

09:48.815 --> 09:50.316
with the daily
pollen count chart

09:50.384 --> 09:52.118
that the Forest Service keeps.

09:52.202 --> 09:55.121
Oh. Which gives us
an accurate time of death.

09:55.205 --> 09:57.406
Suddenly what I'm doing
is pretty cool, isn't it?

09:57.457 --> 09:58.908
Eh, kind of.

09:58.959 --> 10:00.076
A little.

10:00.127 --> 10:01.744
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

10:01.795 --> 10:03.129
How are you feeling?

10:03.213 --> 10:04.780
The baby making
you sick today?

10:04.831 --> 10:07.616
Well, the only place I'm
not nauseous is here.

10:07.668 --> 10:09.652
Which is weird, because...

10:09.719 --> 10:12.104
this place always used
to make me sick before.

10:12.189 --> 10:13.656
Well, when you
feel better...

10:13.723 --> 10:15.741
we can take off
for our baby-moon.

10:15.826 --> 10:17.743
Baby-moon?

10:17.828 --> 10:19.328
Yeah, you know--
last trip

10:19.396 --> 10:22.198
before we lose all freedom
and become our parents.

10:22.249 --> 10:23.732
Which, in your case, is okay,

10:23.784 --> 10:25.584
because, you know,
your dad's pretty cool.

10:25.669 --> 10:27.953
Well, we should
go back to Paris.

10:28.038 --> 10:29.905
Ah, but of course. Where else?

10:29.956 --> 10:31.707
And you get to eat
whatever you'd like,

10:31.758 --> 10:33.959
because you're gonna look
like the <i>Hindenburg</i> anyway.

10:34.044 --> 10:35.795
Nice, nice.

10:35.879 --> 10:38.514
More to love, you know?

10:38.582 --> 10:39.915
More to love.

10:39.966 --> 10:42.385
Mm.
Did you I.D.
the victim yet?

10:42.436 --> 10:44.437
Well, sort of.

10:46.723 --> 10:48.724
The woman...
is Hillary Fuller.

10:48.775 --> 10:50.993
I got a match through the DMV,

10:51.061 --> 10:52.862
which led to a
missing persons report

10:52.929 --> 10:54.063
filed by her boss.

10:54.131 --> 10:57.049
But the guy's skull
was a little bit harder.

10:58.318 --> 11:00.069
George Clooney.

11:00.120 --> 11:01.454
Victim's skull was funky,

11:01.538 --> 11:03.956
so this was the best
that I could do.

11:06.276 --> 11:08.711
Oh, victim, who art thou?

11:11.415 --> 11:12.832
Oh, Agent Booth.

11:12.916 --> 11:14.283
No.
No what?

11:14.334 --> 11:15.668
No, I'm not gonna
talk about Hannah.

11:15.752 --> 11:17.720
Oh, I just want you to
know that I understand

11:17.787 --> 11:18.971
this could be a
loaded situation,

11:19.055 --> 11:20.890
and if you need
any help...
Maybe you should

11:20.957 --> 11:22.558
take care of your
own house first.

11:22.625 --> 11:24.626
I imagine you're
referring to me and Daisy.

11:24.678 --> 11:26.429
Yeah, that whole on-again,
off-again thing,

11:26.480 --> 11:28.230
that's not good.
I know, I know.

11:28.298 --> 11:30.316
I'm trying to deal
with it, but I find that

11:30.400 --> 11:32.485
if I consider making
a clean break, you know,

11:32.569 --> 11:34.687
although it opens up
my world sexually,

11:34.771 --> 11:35.905
Oh-ho!
I might lose...

11:35.972 --> 11:37.990
You're seriously talking
about that now?

11:38.074 --> 11:39.808
No. No, of course not.

11:39.860 --> 11:41.310
That's good. Good, pal.

11:41.361 --> 11:43.362
But to wrap up,
Daisy and I
Yeah.

11:43.447 --> 11:45.364
have no obligations
to each other,
no commitments.

11:45.449 --> 11:47.149
You know, we're just
riding that wave.

11:47.200 --> 11:48.584
Ride the wave.
You hang ten.

11:48.651 --> 11:50.753
I'm gonna go try and
solve a murder, okay?

11:50.820 --> 11:52.321
Don't forget the SPF.

11:59.496 --> 12:01.514
So, you reported
Hillary Fuller missing.

12:01.598 --> 12:02.798
Yes.

12:02.849 --> 12:04.333
She was my marketing manager.

12:04.384 --> 12:06.886
Um, she'd only worked for me
for a few months,

12:06.970 --> 12:09.555
but, uh, it wasn't like her
to just disappear.

12:09.639 --> 12:11.690
So I called her place,
her cell.

12:11.775 --> 12:14.143
Then I got worried.
Right.

12:14.211 --> 12:16.395
Do you take an interest
in all your employees?

12:16.480 --> 12:17.947
What do you mean?

12:18.014 --> 12:19.315
Oh, well,

12:19.382 --> 12:22.117
you're single;
Hillary is very attractive.
Hey,

12:22.185 --> 12:24.153
I came down here to help;
now I'm a suspect?

12:24.204 --> 12:26.205
Why are you so defensive?
I'm just asking a question.

12:26.289 --> 12:27.907
Look...

12:27.991 --> 12:29.825
Hillary,
she seemed great.

12:29.876 --> 12:31.827
We went out to lunch
a couple times.

12:31.878 --> 12:33.579
She p-put on the brakes.

12:33.647 --> 12:34.914
And you were okay with that?

12:34.981 --> 12:37.583
Yes. Yes, she didn't
want to get involved.

12:37.667 --> 12:39.869
That's cool; I'm a big boy.

12:41.171 --> 12:43.839
You recognize
this man?

12:43.890 --> 12:46.091
Sure, it's
George Clooney.

12:46.176 --> 12:47.476
She was killed
by George Clooney?

12:47.544 --> 12:49.678
It's not Clooney;
it's the other victim.

12:51.181 --> 12:53.399
You know what I think?
I think Hillary and this man

12:53.483 --> 12:55.134
were killed by somebody
who was very jealous.

12:55.202 --> 12:57.486
I reported her missing,
remember?

12:58.622 --> 13:00.606
I do. I remember, yeah.

13:08.898 --> 13:11.000
I'm here at the U.S. base in
Afghanistan's Khost Province...

13:11.067 --> 13:12.668
She is hot.

13:12.735 --> 13:14.736
Yes, she's
in Afghanistan.

13:14.788 --> 13:17.456
The temperature
is frequently over
a hundred degrees.

13:17.541 --> 13:19.041
No. Attractive hot.

13:19.092 --> 13:21.126
Sexy hot.
Of course.

13:22.912 --> 13:25.381
So Booth seems happy
with her, right?

13:25.448 --> 13:28.717
Yes. He always wanted to find
someone to share his life.

13:30.170 --> 13:33.138
I don't think he expected it
to happen like this.

13:35.058 --> 13:36.525
Just like you.

13:36.593 --> 13:38.310
Like me?

13:38.378 --> 13:40.095
Well, you've also found a mate,

13:40.146 --> 13:42.398
although you never expected
to be in a long-term,

13:42.449 --> 13:44.400
monogamous relationship.

13:44.451 --> 13:48.370
Yeah, well, love sort of
decided that for me.

13:48.438 --> 13:50.573
Like Cam,

13:50.624 --> 13:52.575
she never expected
to be a parent.

13:54.077 --> 13:57.296
So I'm the only one living
the life I expected.

13:57.364 --> 13:58.998
Well, how is that, honey?

13:59.082 --> 14:01.333
It's, um...

14:01.418 --> 14:03.586
it's as I expected.

14:06.089 --> 14:08.474
I have time of... Whoa.

14:08.558 --> 14:10.225
Wow.

14:10.293 --> 14:11.393
Is that her?

14:11.461 --> 14:13.479
Don't drool, Hodgins.

14:13.563 --> 14:14.630
Huh?

14:14.681 --> 14:16.932
No, no, no. Only when I...

14:16.983 --> 14:18.567
look at you, Angie.

14:18.635 --> 14:20.102
May I?

14:20.153 --> 14:21.737
I, uh, found time of death.

14:21.804 --> 14:23.072
I cross-referenced

14:23.139 --> 14:24.990
the pollen
from the nasal cavity

14:25.058 --> 14:27.042
with the pollen charts
at the Forest Service.

14:27.110 --> 14:29.495
They died two weeks ago
on the 13th.

14:29.579 --> 14:31.330
I'll tell Booth.

14:31.414 --> 14:34.233
...person might have gained
entry onto the base.

14:34.301 --> 14:37.703
This is the third time
this year

14:37.787 --> 14:40.422
a suicide bomber has struck...
She's not that great, really.

14:40.490 --> 14:42.207
You know. Homely.

14:42.292 --> 14:44.510
Homely, actually,
I mean, compared to you.

14:44.594 --> 14:46.512
Keep going. Don't stop.

14:46.596 --> 14:48.714
Goddess on high.

14:48.798 --> 14:51.266
Mother
of my unborn child.

14:51.334 --> 14:53.802
Love of my life.

14:59.859 --> 15:01.977
So, you're sure
they died on the 13th?

15:02.028 --> 15:03.178
Hodgins was certain. Why?

15:03.229 --> 15:05.180
A park ranger mentioned
a killing, you know,

15:05.231 --> 15:07.066
a while ago, so I
checked it out.

15:07.150 --> 15:08.567
Here, let me use
this computer here.

15:08.652 --> 15:11.086
Winston Hinkle.

15:11.154 --> 15:12.621
He had a history
of mental illness.

15:12.689 --> 15:14.356
Got into a big fight
with a camper

15:14.407 --> 15:15.874
and ended up
beating him to death.

15:15.959 --> 15:17.459
Got eight years
for manslaughter.

15:17.527 --> 15:19.828
What does this have to do
with the 13th?

15:19.879 --> 15:22.414
Well, he was released
two weeks ago, on the 11th.

15:22.499 --> 15:25.000
Parole officer says he lives
right outside the park.

15:25.051 --> 15:27.636
Uh-huh.

15:33.896 --> 15:35.431
<i>So Hinkle was diagnosed</i>

15:35.457 --> 15:38.259
with bipolar
and cyclothymic disorder

15:38.344 --> 15:39.510
with episodes of paranoia.

15:39.562 --> 15:42.180
Okay, so why would
they let him out?

15:42.231 --> 15:44.098
Well, the attending
psychiatrist feels

15:44.183 --> 15:46.401
that his illness
is under control.

15:46.485 --> 15:48.903
He's taking his meds,
hasn't had a serious episode

15:48.988 --> 15:50.655
in over three years.

15:52.057 --> 15:53.608
Booth.

15:53.692 --> 15:55.159
Oh, hey.

15:55.227 --> 15:56.911
Uh...

15:56.996 --> 16:00.114
No, I'm just, uh, working.

16:00.199 --> 16:02.000
No. Not Bones.

16:02.067 --> 16:04.118
Sweets.

16:04.203 --> 16:06.371
Sure.

16:06.422 --> 16:08.406
All right, I'll
see you then.

16:08.457 --> 16:09.573
Okay.

16:13.012 --> 16:14.545
What are you staring at?
Don't do that.

16:14.597 --> 16:16.580
I just think it's...
it's interesting

16:16.632 --> 16:18.549
that you'd be so
self-conscious...

16:18.601 --> 16:20.584
on the phone.
Really?
Interesting?

16:20.636 --> 16:22.186
Because I'm having
a private conversation

16:22.254 --> 16:24.272
in front of someone
who's really nosy?

16:24.356 --> 16:26.975
Well... you could
be self-conscious

16:27.059 --> 16:29.894
'cause I know your history
with Dr. Brennan.

16:29.945 --> 16:31.429
I mean, you know, it's natural
to have mixed feelings...

16:31.480 --> 16:32.930
Do you want to know
what I'm feeling?

16:32.982 --> 16:34.449
Yeah.
Do you really want to
know what I'm feeling?

16:34.533 --> 16:36.234
Please.
Okay, when I
left Afghanistan,

16:36.285 --> 16:39.904
I was miserable, thinking that
I would never see Hannah again.

16:39.955 --> 16:42.606
And... and why do you
think that is, huh,

16:42.658 --> 16:43.625
Dr. Phil?

16:43.709 --> 16:45.293
Why don't you tell <i>me?</i>
Because

16:45.377 --> 16:46.944
I'm crazy about her.

16:47.046 --> 16:49.580
Because my life is just way
better when we're together.

16:49.632 --> 16:51.132
Right? Which is
why I'm happy.

16:51.216 --> 16:53.284
All right? The past
is the past, okay?

16:53.335 --> 16:54.618
I'm happy, Sweets.

16:54.670 --> 16:56.620
I believe you.

16:56.672 --> 16:58.122
Yeah.
You're a lucky man.

16:58.173 --> 16:59.290
I know.

16:59.341 --> 17:01.625
Now, let's get on your
little shrinky mojo

17:01.677 --> 17:03.461
so that you can pick up
any leftover crazy

17:03.512 --> 17:04.929
that the other doctors
might have missed.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.513
My shrinky mojo--
that's how it works?
Yeah.

17:06.598 --> 17:08.465
Mm-hmm, yeah,
that's how it works.

17:08.517 --> 17:10.550
<i>Stop staring at me like that.</i>

17:20.945 --> 17:22.363
Oh.

17:22.448 --> 17:23.647
Okay.

17:23.715 --> 17:25.450
You did bring
your gun, right?

17:25.517 --> 17:26.817
Yeah.

17:26.868 --> 17:29.454
This is private property;
you're trespassing.
FBI.

17:29.505 --> 17:32.040
Mr. Hinkle, I just have
to ask you a few questions.

17:32.124 --> 17:34.459
I did my time-- I check in with
my parole officer every week.

17:34.526 --> 17:35.877
I could either tell
your parole officer

17:35.961 --> 17:37.595
that you were belligerent
or cooperative.

17:37.662 --> 17:39.663
Which do you think
he'd be happier with?

17:39.715 --> 17:41.966
If you got a question,
you just ask it.

17:42.034 --> 17:43.468
Yeah, a couple
was found dead

17:43.535 --> 17:46.521
here in the park, two days
after you were released.

17:54.229 --> 17:56.230
Yeah, I guess I should
have expected this.

17:56.315 --> 17:58.149
Expected to be caught?

17:58.217 --> 18:01.185
He means he expected to be
perceived as the man he was.

18:01.253 --> 18:02.653
That's what your
doctor told you?

18:02.705 --> 18:04.655
I'm on my meds;
I turned my life around.

18:04.707 --> 18:06.240
I know what I did was wrong.

18:06.325 --> 18:08.242
Of course, why should
anybody else believe that?

18:08.327 --> 18:10.378
You have court-ordered
therapy sessions twice a week.

18:10.462 --> 18:12.997
Any trouble making it out
to the sessions from here?

18:13.065 --> 18:14.432
No.
Okay, can you

18:14.500 --> 18:16.050
account for your whereabouts
on the 13th?

18:16.118 --> 18:17.552
No.

18:17.636 --> 18:18.669
Do you recognize

18:18.721 --> 18:20.704
these people?

18:20.756 --> 18:22.056
Him, yeah.

18:22.141 --> 18:24.175
They showed us
his movies in prison.

18:24.243 --> 18:25.543
It's not George
Clooney, okay?

18:25.594 --> 18:26.928
These are the victims.

18:27.012 --> 18:28.846
Beaten, like the guy you killed.

18:28.897 --> 18:30.932
I deserve this, I know.

18:31.016 --> 18:33.184
But I didn't kill
anybody, I swear.

18:33.252 --> 18:36.387
I'm gonna keep an eye
on you... Winston.

18:39.408 --> 18:41.392
So?
Well, he seems to be
telling the truth,

18:41.443 --> 18:43.227
but his meds could
be masking a lot.

18:43.278 --> 18:46.114
You know,  honestly, your whole
mojo is just disappointing.

18:46.198 --> 18:47.949
But my mojo's good.

18:56.442 --> 18:59.427
<i>The injuries on the female</i>

18:59.495 --> 19:03.097
indicate that
the left posterior
ribs eight through 11

19:03.182 --> 19:06.100
shattered, piercing the heart,
lungs and kidneys.

19:06.185 --> 19:08.269
Her scapula is also broken,

19:08.353 --> 19:10.805
which could have
pierced the lung.

19:10.873 --> 19:12.273
His injuries were

19:12.341 --> 19:15.960
more presented in the anterior
and weren't as severe.

19:16.028 --> 19:18.095
Internal bleeding would have
taken much longer to kill him.

19:18.147 --> 19:19.313
He could've gone for help.

19:19.398 --> 19:20.448
The woman was bleeding out.

19:20.532 --> 19:21.732
Perhaps he didn't
want to leave her.

19:21.784 --> 19:23.618
So he stayed and held her.

19:23.702 --> 19:26.487
And she died in his arms.
We need to discover

19:26.572 --> 19:27.822
why the injuries were localized:

19:27.890 --> 19:29.991
his in the front,
hers in the back.

19:30.075 --> 19:33.544
No one would deliver
a beating so... carefully.

19:41.453 --> 19:43.588
<i>Seeley tells me</i>

19:43.639 --> 19:45.306
you're the best partner
he's ever had.

19:45.390 --> 19:46.974
Well, I'm sure
that's true.

19:47.059 --> 19:49.293
I'm not only gifted
intellectually

19:49.344 --> 19:51.662
and internationally
known, but I'm also

19:51.730 --> 19:54.699
highly skilled
in various methods
of self-defense.

19:54.750 --> 19:58.202
I like a person who
isn't hampered by modesty.

19:58.253 --> 20:00.755
I have two Peabodys,

20:00.839 --> 20:02.173
a National Press Award,

20:02.240 --> 20:04.208
and I've been wounded
three times getting stories.

20:04.259 --> 20:06.677
I kick
Christiane Amanpour's ass.

20:06.745 --> 20:07.762
We are both

20:07.846 --> 20:09.213
quite impressive.

20:10.682 --> 20:12.600
Booth never told me how you met.

20:12.684 --> 20:15.136
It was outside Marja.

20:15.220 --> 20:16.554
The Taliban controlled the area,

20:16.605 --> 20:19.724
and I was going in
to interview one of the leaders.

20:19.775 --> 20:21.526
She was told not
to go in, but,

20:21.593 --> 20:24.362
of course, it didn't matter,
she goes in.

20:24.429 --> 20:29.534
I was heading to a cafe, walking
across this little town square,

20:29.601 --> 20:31.736
and an insurgent opened fire.

20:31.787 --> 20:33.487
Anyway, Seeley
was there.

20:33.572 --> 20:36.991
I didn't notice at the time--
he was hidden, of course.

20:37.075 --> 20:38.376
I was scrambling
for cover.

20:38.443 --> 20:42.129
The sniper was still firing when
I heard another shot ring out.

20:42.214 --> 20:45.249
The sniper dropped--
wounded,

20:45.317 --> 20:48.886
not killed, because
he might have information.

20:48.954 --> 20:51.339
Seeley never went for the kill
if he could help it.

20:54.309 --> 20:56.594
He saved your life.

20:56.645 --> 20:58.596
You know what,
we met on the field.

20:58.647 --> 21:01.015
Let's just leave it at that,
shall we?

21:01.099 --> 21:02.733
Let's just say

21:02.801 --> 21:03.818
I was very appreciative.

21:03.902 --> 21:05.519
You're implying
that you showed

21:05.604 --> 21:07.104
your appreciation sexually.

21:07.155 --> 21:08.472
Oh, yeah!
Yeah.

21:09.441 --> 21:10.491
Under a fig tree.

21:10.576 --> 21:11.659
I never liked figs,

21:11.743 --> 21:13.277
now I... I love 'em.
I know.

21:17.666 --> 21:18.616
Brennan.

21:18.667 --> 21:20.251
Oh, Booth is here, too.

21:20.318 --> 21:22.036
I'll put you on speakerphone.

21:22.120 --> 21:25.673
Hey. So I found eggs from
the Sternorrhyncha Aphidoidea.

21:25.757 --> 21:27.541
They were on George Clooney.

21:27.626 --> 21:29.427
It's like pulling teeth from
this guy. Okay, Hodgins,

21:29.494 --> 21:31.462
the eggs, they come
from chickens, or...?

21:31.513 --> 21:33.798
Yeah, I just told you-- aphids.

21:33.849 --> 21:35.416
So I hatched the eggs,

21:35.484 --> 21:37.234
and it turns out
the aphids are wingless.

21:37.302 --> 21:39.120
Who's that?
This is fascinating.

21:39.187 --> 21:40.438
Hannah.
Hannah.

21:40.505 --> 21:41.839
Oh. Hey, uh, hi.

21:41.890 --> 21:43.891
Uh, it's nice to meet you.

21:43.976 --> 21:45.192
I, um...

21:45.277 --> 21:46.777
I'm, uh, Hodgins.

21:46.845 --> 21:48.396
Um, <i>Dr.</i> Hodgins.

21:48.480 --> 21:50.948
Uh, I am a big fan.

21:51.016 --> 21:54.035
I just read the piece where
you stuck it to CENTCOM in 2009.

21:54.119 --> 21:54.986
Thanks.

21:55.037 --> 21:56.320
Hey, maybe while you're here,

21:56.371 --> 21:58.239
you can find out
why every time there's

21:58.323 --> 21:59.957
a big story, and I mean like

22:00.025 --> 22:01.742
an earthquake
or government corruption,

22:01.827 --> 22:03.828
there's always some celebrity
story that takes focus.

22:03.879 --> 22:05.713
You know?
The BP oil spill,
Hodges.

22:05.797 --> 22:07.331
Lindsay Lohan goes to jail,

22:07.382 --> 22:09.250
and the country takes
their eye off the ball.

22:09.334 --> 22:10.384
Hodgins.
Media is used

22:10.469 --> 22:11.836
to distract us all the time.

22:11.887 --> 22:13.504
You're taking him seriously?
Michael Jackson's

22:13.555 --> 22:15.506
funeral is on 24 hours a day,

22:15.557 --> 22:18.092
and nobody finds out
about the coup in Honduras.

22:18.176 --> 22:20.177
Felt fishy to me.
I love this woman.

22:20.228 --> 22:22.480
We were talking
about wingless aphids,

22:22.547 --> 22:24.348
Dr. Hodgins.
We were?

22:24.399 --> 22:26.567
Right, yes, no, we w-were.

22:26.652 --> 22:28.269
So, wingless aphids,
they couldn't have existed

22:28.353 --> 22:29.603
where we found the remains.

22:29.688 --> 22:31.605
They live in
windier environments

22:31.690 --> 22:32.773
at a higher altitude.

22:32.858 --> 22:33.858
So I checked

22:33.925 --> 22:35.559
the wind patterns
at various altitudes,

22:35.610 --> 22:37.895
and I found some cabins
in the park

22:37.946 --> 22:39.463
that hikers use to rest.

22:39.531 --> 22:40.498
They must have been there.

22:40.565 --> 22:41.582
The male victim may have left

22:41.667 --> 22:42.783
something which could I.D. him.

22:42.868 --> 22:44.001
Thanks, Hodgins.

22:44.069 --> 22:45.670
We should get back to the park.
And I got

22:45.737 --> 22:47.121
to get up to Capitol Hill.

22:47.205 --> 22:48.539
I'm covering
the Armed Services hearing.

22:48.590 --> 22:49.707
I'll see you back
at the apartment.

22:49.758 --> 22:51.926
Yes.

22:52.010 --> 22:53.744
PARK RANGER:
If George Clooney
had been up here,

22:53.795 --> 22:56.047
I'm sure I'd remember.
Ah, it's not Clooney.

22:56.098 --> 22:58.265
Apparently, it's not
a very accurate sketch.

22:58.350 --> 23:00.351
Sorry, I don't recognize
either one of 'em.

23:00.418 --> 23:03.187
But, then, hundreds
of people come to
the park every day.

23:03.254 --> 23:05.139
Well, it's worth a shot.

23:05.223 --> 23:07.224
Cabins are
inspected weekly.

23:07.275 --> 23:10.611
If anything was found,
I'm sure it would be
in the lost and found.

23:10.696 --> 23:12.863
There doesn't seem to be
anything in the cabin.

23:15.283 --> 23:17.434
I filled out
my application
like you said.

23:17.486 --> 23:19.737
You know, if, uh, we
work well together,

23:19.788 --> 23:21.155
maybe you'll give me
a recommendation,

23:21.239 --> 23:22.707
brothers in arms,
and all.

23:22.774 --> 23:24.208
We'll see what happens.

23:24.275 --> 23:25.743
Look at this, Booth.

23:25.794 --> 23:28.579
Wow. Look at all
these names, huh?

23:28.630 --> 23:30.464
Talk about the love shack!

23:30.549 --> 23:33.134
Couples have been known
to use the shelter for the...

23:33.218 --> 23:34.919
occasional romantic interlude.

23:34.970 --> 23:36.420
Like a fig tree.

23:36.471 --> 23:37.972
Beg your pardon?
Nothing.

23:38.040 --> 23:39.473
I like figs.
Look at this.

23:39.558 --> 23:42.343
This is fresh. "9-13."

23:42.427 --> 23:43.644
The day they died.

23:43.729 --> 23:44.895
"HF."

23:44.963 --> 23:46.313
Hillary Fuller.

23:46.398 --> 23:48.799
Yeah, but who's FV?

23:55.717 --> 23:57.335
<i>I was trying anything</i>
<i>to get an idea</i>

23:57.360 --> 23:59.245
of the mystery man,
so I analyzed

23:59.257 --> 24:01.625
the strontium isotope
composition of his teeth.

24:01.676 --> 24:03.811
Now, it indicates
that the victim

24:03.895 --> 24:07.347
spent his first 20 or so
years in Central America.

24:07.415 --> 24:08.765
Probably Guatemala,

24:08.833 --> 24:10.834
based on the oxygen ratios.

24:10.902 --> 24:13.737
Well, the remaining tissue
I collected from his hands

24:13.804 --> 24:15.656
shows a high level of nicotine.

24:15.740 --> 24:17.808
So he had

24:17.876 --> 24:18.859
green tobacco sickness.

24:18.943 --> 24:20.828
He was a migrant worker
picking tobacco.

24:20.895 --> 24:23.447
Which might be why we
can't get a match for him.

24:23.498 --> 24:27.117
So the initials "FV" would
probably be Spanish in origin.

24:27.185 --> 24:29.620
But Hillary Fuller was
a college-educated woman

24:29.671 --> 24:31.788
with a good job
at a marketing firm.

24:31.840 --> 24:33.307
Why would she be
romantically involved

24:33.374 --> 24:34.558
with a migrant worker?

24:34.626 --> 24:36.326
See if the victims share
any additional

24:36.377 --> 24:38.328
genetic or
environmental markers.

24:44.602 --> 24:47.354
So, she was a marketing director
and he was a migrant worker.

24:47.438 --> 24:49.306
I can't believe they
were a romantic couple.

24:49.357 --> 24:50.757
Just because they had
different backgrounds,

24:50.825 --> 24:53.060
what, you're saying that
they can't be in love?

24:53.144 --> 24:55.845
Your belief in the power of
love is admirable, Booth,

24:55.897 --> 24:59.066
but an affair between these two
is an anthropological anomaly.

24:59.150 --> 25:01.235
Yeah, I mean, crossing
class boundaries that extreme

25:01.319 --> 25:02.903
would be rare
and indicate

25:02.987 --> 25:05.188
that our victims had
something in common we haven't

25:05.240 --> 25:06.907
discovered yet.
So it's not possible

25:06.991 --> 25:08.858
for two people to overcome
their differences?

25:08.910 --> 25:10.544
<i>We</i> couldn't.

25:10.628 --> 25:11.912
What?
She's right.

25:11.996 --> 25:13.497
This is not about us.

25:13.565 --> 25:17.701
Sometimes when I was away,
I would imagine us together.

25:19.304 --> 25:20.721
Really?
While pleasant,

25:20.805 --> 25:23.223
it was clearly
a fantasy,

25:23.308 --> 25:25.425
because we are
also anomalous.

25:25.510 --> 25:28.178
But you were lucky enough
to meet someone

25:28.229 --> 25:29.897
with whom you have parity.

25:29.981 --> 25:30.731
Love.

25:30.815 --> 25:32.382
With whom I have love.

25:32.433 --> 25:35.218
Do you guys want
to talk about this?

25:35.270 --> 25:36.069
Nope.

25:36.854 --> 25:38.188
No?

25:38.239 --> 25:40.023
'Cause I figure
since Hannah is now

25:40.091 --> 25:41.942
a part of your life...
Why don't you just focus

25:42.026 --> 25:44.111
on what connected them,
if they were so incompatible.

25:44.195 --> 25:46.580
Okay? That's easy enough
for you to do, right?

25:46.664 --> 25:47.581
Brennan.

25:47.649 --> 25:49.199
I found the connection.

25:49.250 --> 25:50.534
Osteopenia.

25:50.585 --> 25:52.569
Both victims exhibit
low bone mass

25:52.620 --> 25:54.288
and suppressed
bone formation.

25:54.355 --> 25:55.572
They were alcoholics.

25:55.623 --> 25:57.240
Oh. That's the connection.

25:57.292 --> 25:59.259
Now, although Hillary Fuller's
bones were still weak,

25:59.327 --> 26:00.594
her osteoblasts
did show evidence

26:00.678 --> 26:02.412
of a recent increase
in bone growth,

26:02.463 --> 26:03.630
sufficient to indicate that

26:03.715 --> 26:05.882
she hadn't been drinking
for at least two years.

26:05.950 --> 26:08.652
I did a count on the male
victim's osteoblasts, too,

26:08.720 --> 26:10.637
and found that they were
also returning to normal.

26:10.722 --> 26:12.105
So he had also stopped drinking.

26:12.190 --> 26:14.741
But according to the figures,
only within the last year.

26:14.809 --> 26:16.026
All right, thanks.

26:16.094 --> 26:17.927
So both of them
had stopped drinking.

26:17.979 --> 26:19.379
She more than
two years ago;

26:19.447 --> 26:20.664
he less than a year.

26:20.732 --> 26:21.732
I know the connection.

26:22.483 --> 26:23.734
A.A.

26:29.958 --> 26:31.325
Excuse me.

26:31.409 --> 26:33.243
FBI. I see you're
wearing your chip.

26:33.294 --> 26:35.879
So you've probably been
coming here for a while, huh?

26:35.947 --> 26:37.130
This is a safe
environment.

26:37.215 --> 26:39.049
We don't rat out
our friends here.

26:39.116 --> 26:41.635
Just want to ask you a few
questions about Hillary Fuller.

26:41.719 --> 26:43.470
She used to live
in this area, so this

26:43.554 --> 26:44.588
was probably her meeting.

26:44.639 --> 26:45.922
I ain't talking to no cop.

26:45.974 --> 26:47.624
Don't be such an ass-hat, Hank.

26:47.675 --> 26:48.976
I knew Hillary.

26:49.060 --> 26:50.260
What happen,

26:50.311 --> 26:51.628
she fall off the wagon?
No,

26:51.679 --> 26:52.779
but she <i>is</i> dead.

26:54.682 --> 26:55.799
We believe murdered.

26:55.850 --> 26:57.067
Oh, God.

26:57.135 --> 26:58.185
You still haven't learned

26:58.269 --> 27:00.270
how to ease into that one,
right, Bones?

27:01.673 --> 27:04.274
Do you recognize
this man?

27:04.325 --> 27:06.643
He killed her?

27:06.694 --> 27:08.445
He seems so nice in the movies.

27:08.496 --> 27:10.080
No, this is the
other victim

27:10.147 --> 27:11.682
who was found with Hillary.

27:11.749 --> 27:13.834
His initials are F.V.

27:13.918 --> 27:15.118
F.V.

27:15.169 --> 27:17.020
Oh, Felix!

27:17.088 --> 27:19.239
He does kind of look
like George Clooney.

27:19.307 --> 27:20.824
Oh... wait, I-I-I...

27:20.875 --> 27:23.126
I can't believe this--
Felix is gone, too?

27:23.194 --> 27:25.796
They were found in
Taylor National
Park in a cave.

27:25.847 --> 27:27.347
Makes sense.

27:27.415 --> 27:28.932
Why is that?
If Hillary was
sponsoring someone,

27:28.999 --> 27:30.701
she would take them
in the woods so they could

27:30.768 --> 27:32.436
get in touch with themselves.
It's a good way

27:32.503 --> 27:34.471
to assess the, you know,
the damages they've done

27:34.522 --> 27:36.606
in their life
and make amends.
Yeah.

27:36.674 --> 27:38.141
You in the program?
I'm a gambler.

27:38.192 --> 27:40.193
But I haven't
laid a bet in years.

27:40.278 --> 27:41.678
I do miss
the coffee here, though.

27:41.729 --> 27:42.979
Were Hillary and Felix

27:43.047 --> 27:45.015
romantically involved?

27:45.083 --> 27:47.016
It's not supposed to happen
with your sponsor,

27:47.068 --> 27:48.485
but they just kind of clicked.

27:48.536 --> 27:50.487
And he was having
some trouble at home--
guess his girlfriend

27:50.538 --> 27:51.855
was getting jealous
because Hillary

27:51.906 --> 27:53.457
was helping Felix stay sober.

27:53.524 --> 27:55.158
Right, and they
were falling in love.

27:55.209 --> 27:56.510
That, too.

27:56.577 --> 27:58.695
I guess his girlfriend
couldn't handle it.

27:58.763 --> 28:00.330
But that's life, right?

28:00.398 --> 28:01.648
Things change.

28:05.970 --> 28:08.688
Do you know where we can
find Felix's girlfriend?

28:08.756 --> 28:10.173
Felix was no saint.

28:10.224 --> 28:11.875
He might have been
a teacher in Guatemala,

28:11.926 --> 28:14.394
but here he was just a drunk--
you have his record there.

28:14.479 --> 28:15.562
Right, drunk
and disorderly,

28:15.646 --> 28:17.597
buying alcohol for
a minor, petty theft.

28:17.665 --> 28:18.915
Not major crimes.

28:18.983 --> 28:21.217
You defending him now?
That kid he bought booze for

28:21.269 --> 28:22.602
got into an accident
or something.

28:22.687 --> 28:24.721
I'm just trying to find
out who killed Felix,

28:24.789 --> 28:26.857
and right now you're looking
like a good suspect.

28:26.908 --> 28:28.658
Aw, screw you, man.
Screw me?

28:28.726 --> 28:29.810
Yeah, screw you.

28:29.877 --> 28:31.828
I was always there for him.

28:31.896 --> 28:33.363
I bailed the bastard
out of jail.

28:33.414 --> 28:34.531
I cleaned him up

28:34.582 --> 28:36.232
after he was so drunk
he slept in the street,

28:36.284 --> 28:38.418
and then he cheats on me?
Well, you
don't seem

28:38.503 --> 28:40.020
too upset to find out
that he's dead.

28:40.088 --> 28:42.572
You live with a drunk,
you expect them to die--

28:42.623 --> 28:43.840
I guess I was ready.

28:43.908 --> 28:46.676
All right, so... you
weren't needed anymore

28:46.744 --> 28:48.745
once he got sober.

28:50.247 --> 28:51.548
Right?

28:51.599 --> 28:54.134
I wasted my time with him--
he wasn't a real man.

28:54.218 --> 28:55.752
A real man can take a drink,

28:55.803 --> 28:57.771
he can still party--
he was not a man.

28:57.855 --> 28:59.473
He was to another woman.

28:59.557 --> 29:01.224
That must have made you angry.

29:03.478 --> 29:05.595
Why didn't you
report him missing?

29:05.663 --> 29:07.731
Because I just thought
he'd run off with that bitch.

29:07.782 --> 29:10.400
So you followed him to the woods
just to make sure that was true.

29:10.451 --> 29:12.035
You found him in the woods?

29:12.102 --> 29:14.571
I got allergies--
I don't go to the woods.

29:14.622 --> 29:18.024
Oh, people do crazy things
when they're angry.

29:18.092 --> 29:21.795
Can you account for where
you were on the 13th, Lupe?

29:21.879 --> 29:23.580
I don't have to talk to you.

29:23.648 --> 29:25.816
I don't have to say anything.

29:34.445 --> 29:36.747
I know.

29:36.831 --> 29:40.834
Well, this is the best lunch
I've had in a long time.

29:40.901 --> 29:41.868
Yeah.

29:41.919 --> 29:43.253
You want dessert?

29:45.873 --> 29:47.791
I got to get back to work.
No.

29:47.875 --> 29:49.793
Well, there's always
dinner, right?

29:55.516 --> 29:57.768
You and Brennan...

29:59.187 --> 30:01.471
You two seem solid.

30:01.556 --> 30:04.858
Well... happens
after, you know,

30:04.925 --> 30:07.861
working together
for what, five years.

30:07.928 --> 30:09.279
You know,

30:09.364 --> 30:11.448
I-I'm a little jealous,
actually.

30:11.532 --> 30:13.650
What, you actually think that
there's something going on

30:13.735 --> 30:16.603
between... me and Bones?

30:16.654 --> 30:18.121
No, not that.

30:18.189 --> 30:20.774
Unless there's something
I should know.
No,

30:20.825 --> 30:22.159
of course not.

30:22.243 --> 30:25.295
I guess I'm just jealous
of what you two do together.

30:25.380 --> 30:27.998
The action
in the field.

30:28.082 --> 30:29.499
Oh.

30:29.584 --> 30:32.719
So the Armed Services Committee
is not doing it for you.

30:32.787 --> 30:35.672
No. I think I'm
the only one in the press corps

30:35.757 --> 30:38.124
who refuses to write
her stories from press releases.

30:38.176 --> 30:40.977
You're gonna make trouble
while you're here, aren't you?

30:41.062 --> 30:43.630
As much as possible.

30:43.681 --> 30:46.299
Isn't that why you love me?

30:46.351 --> 30:49.186
That's definitely
one of the reasons.

30:51.606 --> 30:53.973
I got to get back...
to work, Hannah.

30:54.025 --> 30:55.525
I know, I know.

30:55.610 --> 30:58.829
But I'm trouble, remember?

31:08.489 --> 31:11.375
All right!
I was told these
are for you.

31:11.459 --> 31:14.211
Yes, these are the tires
from Lupe Rojas's car.

31:14.295 --> 31:17.180
She denies going to
the park, but Booth
doesn't believe her.

31:17.265 --> 31:18.548
And if she's lying,

31:18.633 --> 31:20.717
the tread should contain
insect and plant matter

31:20.802 --> 31:22.552
that could place here there.
Yeah, exactly.

31:22.637 --> 31:23.687
You know,

31:23.771 --> 31:25.555
you could be
my lovely assistant.

31:25.640 --> 31:28.725
Yes, but since I'm your boss,
you're <i>my</i> lovely assistant.

31:28.810 --> 31:30.560
Ah.

31:30.645 --> 31:32.178
Yeah, right.

31:32.230 --> 31:35.782
Well, at least I'm lovely.

31:35.850 --> 31:37.617
I've reexamined the injuries,

31:37.685 --> 31:39.836
but I haven't found
anything new.

31:39.904 --> 31:40.954
And why do you think
that is?

31:41.021 --> 31:42.506
Because there's nothing new.

31:42.573 --> 31:44.241
Because you've been
looking at them

31:44.325 --> 31:46.827
as if both victims
were attacked and beaten.

31:46.878 --> 31:49.329
Of course. Wasn't
that your supposition?

31:49.380 --> 31:51.331
Yes. But was it yours?

31:51.382 --> 31:53.800
Because an assistant who
doesn't think for himself

31:53.868 --> 31:55.385
has no value to me.

31:55.470 --> 31:57.871
Okay, but I thought that...
No, you didn't--

31:57.922 --> 31:59.005
that's the point.

31:59.073 --> 32:00.841
You repeated an
inconclusive assumption

32:00.892 --> 32:02.526
I made without
all the evidence.

32:02.593 --> 32:04.561
Evidence, by the way, you
were supposed to supply

32:04.629 --> 32:06.379
while I was busy
with other duties.

32:06.431 --> 32:08.598
Okay, I'm gonna assume that
I missed something here.

32:08.683 --> 32:10.484
I can guarantee
that you missed something.

32:10.551 --> 32:11.885
Perhaps this is a reason that

32:11.936 --> 32:13.570
you didn't get
your promotion in Chicago.

32:13.654 --> 32:16.222
Dr. Brennan...
If you hope to redeem
yourself in my eyes,

32:16.274 --> 32:17.824
you will look
at these remains

32:17.925 --> 32:20.794
and tell me exactly what
it is that <i>you</i> missed.

32:20.862 --> 32:22.829
I'm guessing this is about

32:22.880 --> 32:24.631
more than a mistake
by an assistant.

32:24.682 --> 32:26.016
Why would you
think that?

32:26.083 --> 32:27.968
Do you know what she's
talking about, or...?

32:28.035 --> 32:31.555
Yes. But I prefer to focus on
my own failings at this moment.

32:31.639 --> 32:33.473
Someone's altered
your relationship

32:33.541 --> 32:35.175
with Booth, Dr. Brennan.

32:35.226 --> 32:37.343
Do you mean Hannah?
<i>Yes.</i>

32:37.395 --> 32:39.012
Whether or not
you're happy for him,

32:39.063 --> 32:41.014
you have to have feelings
about it.

32:41.065 --> 32:43.733
And if you can't keep that
out of the workplace...

32:43.818 --> 32:45.152
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry,

32:45.203 --> 32:46.369
Dr. Edison, but sometimes

32:46.454 --> 32:48.488
our personal lives
directly affect our work.

32:48.539 --> 32:50.991
No, no, I see what
Dr. Brennan means.

32:51.042 --> 32:52.909
These two people
weren't beaten at all.
You see?

32:52.994 --> 32:55.712
This is about nothing more
than Dr. Edison's incompetence.

32:55.796 --> 32:57.297
That was very kind.

32:57.365 --> 32:59.299
But if they
weren't beaten,

32:59.367 --> 33:00.867
why did Dr. Hodgins
find traces

33:00.935 --> 33:02.352
of sedimentary rock
in their wounds?

33:02.436 --> 33:04.020
Because they
fell on rocks.

33:04.105 --> 33:06.189
And she broke his fall,

33:06.274 --> 33:08.358
which is why his injuries
weren't as severe.

33:08.442 --> 33:10.477
Very good. You see?

33:10.528 --> 33:13.280
I was merely helping Dr. Edison
to be a better scientist.

33:13.347 --> 33:16.849
I apologize, Dr. Brennan.

33:16.901 --> 33:19.536
Accepted.

33:19.620 --> 33:21.688
Those people in Chicago...

33:21.739 --> 33:24.190
were...

33:24.242 --> 33:27.043
foolish to lose you, Dr. Edison.

33:27.128 --> 33:28.812
Thank you.

33:30.331 --> 33:32.549
It's actually quite amusing

33:32.633 --> 33:36.202
to think that Hannah
could ever affect my work.

33:40.892 --> 33:42.676
<i>So I input all</i>

33:42.727 --> 33:43.810
of the injuries and breaks

33:43.878 --> 33:45.679
that were found
on both of the victims.

33:45.730 --> 33:47.314
You can see
that they share

33:47.381 --> 33:48.648
mirror fractures
on their chests

33:48.716 --> 33:49.816
and pelvises.

33:49.883 --> 33:51.184
They're compression fractures
that they share

33:51.252 --> 33:52.769
because he landed
on top of her.

33:52.853 --> 33:54.504
This also explains

33:54.572 --> 33:58.491
why his zygomatic and maxilla
are shattered.

33:58.559 --> 34:00.110
His face struck the
rocks directly.

34:00.194 --> 34:03.196
Now, here are
the injuries on her back.

34:04.849 --> 34:05.982
And I found
some photographs

34:06.050 --> 34:07.900
of the area
surrounding the cave.

34:07.952 --> 34:10.337
I used topographical
overlay software

34:10.404 --> 34:13.757
to find the rocks that would
match their injuries.

34:13.824 --> 34:16.009
So this section
of the rocks here

34:16.076 --> 34:18.545
is the section
that matches their injuries.

34:18.596 --> 34:20.764
It's about 250 feet
from the cave.

34:20.831 --> 34:23.717
Well, with the amount of blood
loss they both were suffering,

34:23.784 --> 34:25.252
they couldn't have
made it any farther.

34:37.898 --> 34:39.783
This is the spot.

34:39.867 --> 34:41.034
Well, I want a forensics
team to come and,

34:41.101 --> 34:43.453
you know, brush
through all these rocks.

34:43.536 --> 34:44.938
They fell from up there.

34:46.706 --> 34:47.706
Maybe it was
a suicide thing.

34:47.775 --> 34:49.326
Nah. Uh-uh.
There was no note.

34:49.393 --> 34:51.210
And everyone who knew them
said they were pretty happy.

34:51.279 --> 34:52.746
W-What's up there?

34:52.797 --> 34:54.246
It's a vista point.

34:54.297 --> 34:55.465
Beautiful view.

34:55.549 --> 34:56.666
It's just tough to access.

34:56.734 --> 34:58.802
Usually only experienced
hikers go up there.

34:58.886 --> 35:00.003
Well, Hillary was experienced.

35:00.087 --> 35:01.721
She brought people
from the program up here.

35:01.789 --> 35:03.540
Program?
Yeah. A.A.

35:03.608 --> 35:05.642
So there wouldn't be a
lot of people up there?

35:05.710 --> 35:08.294
No one would see if someone
pushed the couple off the cliff?

35:08.346 --> 35:10.146
God. No, I guess not.

35:12.483 --> 35:13.650
Booth.

35:14.935 --> 35:16.469
Great. Thanks.

35:16.520 --> 35:18.655
That was Hodgins. Lupe lied.

35:18.739 --> 35:20.857
He found evidence,
uh, in her tire treads

35:20.941 --> 35:22.108
that she was up here.

35:38.104 --> 35:40.021
This place is freaky.
Why are we here?

35:40.066 --> 35:41.316
Is this some kind
of torture place?

35:41.367 --> 35:43.068
We're just going
to verify your story.

35:43.152 --> 35:44.486
I didn't kill them.

35:44.537 --> 35:46.187
Oh, really? Then why did you
lie about going to the park?

35:46.239 --> 35:47.789
Because I knew
you wouldn't believe me

35:47.857 --> 35:49.124
if you knew
I drove out there.

35:49.191 --> 35:51.192
Now that you lied, I
believe you even less.

35:51.244 --> 35:53.027
I am telling you,
I got allergies.

35:53.079 --> 35:55.196
I followed them, but then I
started sneezing up there.

35:55.248 --> 35:56.364
My eyes puffed up.

35:56.416 --> 35:57.632
I couldn't see,
so I went home.

35:57.700 --> 35:58.967
You ready?
All ready.

35:59.034 --> 36:00.736
Ready? Ready, ready, ready.

36:00.803 --> 36:02.104
Ready? Ready for what?

36:02.155 --> 36:04.139
What are we ready for?
I'm not ready.

36:07.026 --> 36:08.143
What are those?

36:08.194 --> 36:09.661
Well, you know,
you said you followed them

36:09.746 --> 36:11.613
to the top of the trail, till
you couldn't go any further.

36:11.664 --> 36:12.998
'Cause I was sneezing
and stuff. Yeah.

36:13.082 --> 36:14.900
Yeah, so we're just going
to do a little experiment.

36:14.967 --> 36:16.585
I feel really
uncomfortable about this.

36:16.652 --> 36:19.204
We usually don't do experiments
on live humans.

36:19.288 --> 36:21.156
I know.
Should be fun.

36:21.207 --> 36:23.675
You said you were going to give
me a chance to clear myself.

36:23.760 --> 36:25.427
We are, unless you want me to
lock you up for a few weeks,

36:25.494 --> 36:27.796
until a public defender comes
along to take your case.

36:27.847 --> 36:28.997
That's up to you.
What do you think?

36:29.048 --> 36:30.549
These are plants

36:30.633 --> 36:32.718
that grow at the higher
altitudes in the park.

36:32.802 --> 36:35.854
Trumpet honeysuckle,
red twig dogwood,

36:35.938 --> 36:37.272
Russian hawthorn.

36:37.339 --> 36:39.307
Let's start
with that one.

36:45.148 --> 36:46.481
What are you, witches?

36:46.532 --> 36:47.866
'Cause my grandmother
knows spells.

36:47.950 --> 36:49.868
Okay. Next one.

36:49.952 --> 36:51.987
This is dogwood.

36:56.125 --> 36:57.743
Not looking good, Lupe.

36:57.827 --> 37:00.378
And this is
the honeysuckle.

37:00.463 --> 37:01.963
Oh!

37:02.031 --> 37:03.331
Jeez!

37:05.968 --> 37:07.636
God! Get it away!

37:13.709 --> 37:15.877
Clark, why didn't you say
you were allergic?

37:15.928 --> 37:16.728
I didn't know!

37:16.813 --> 37:18.980
I'm calling my grandma!

37:20.149 --> 37:21.566
She's telling the
truth, Booth.

37:21.651 --> 37:23.685
Her allergies are severe and
she wouldn't have been able

37:23.736 --> 37:25.187
to continue following
them up there.

37:32.695 --> 37:34.279
I'm going to go get
an antihistamine.

37:40.203 --> 37:41.453
I think I found something.

37:45.091 --> 37:49.094
Most of the flesh was decomposed
or eaten by parasites,

37:49.178 --> 37:51.046
except for this area,
around his eye and cheek.

37:52.448 --> 37:54.199
Flesh is desiccated,

37:54.267 --> 37:55.934
and seems to be untouched
by scavengers.

37:56.002 --> 37:58.103
If they ate everything else, why
would the animals avoid that?

37:58.187 --> 37:59.354
That's what I asked myself.

37:59.421 --> 38:01.389
So I did an analysis
of the tissue

38:01.440 --> 38:03.058
and compared it
with the tissue

38:03.109 --> 38:04.893
I took off other parts
of the remains.

38:04.944 --> 38:08.613
This tissue from around his eye
contains capsaicin.

38:08.698 --> 38:10.682
Pepper spray?

38:10.750 --> 38:12.600
Yes, but at a very high
concentration.

38:12.652 --> 38:13.952
Government issue.

38:14.036 --> 38:15.287
The scavengers
wouldn't touch it.

38:15.371 --> 38:16.955
Wait a second.
Forest Services issues

38:17.039 --> 38:18.373
a highly
concentrated spray

38:18.440 --> 38:19.941
to park rangers,

38:20.009 --> 38:23.128
who encounter bears
or other aggressive anals.

38:29.335 --> 38:31.953
We looked at Felix's
rap sheet a little closer,

38:32.004 --> 38:34.222
and the minor he bought
liquor for was your niece.

38:34.290 --> 38:36.975
She drank too much and
got into a car accident.

38:37.043 --> 38:38.426
And she died.

38:38.477 --> 38:40.295
Isn't that
right, Gary?

38:45.968 --> 38:47.468
I saw him hiking
with that woman.

38:47.520 --> 38:49.087
I recognized him
from court.

38:49.155 --> 38:52.073
When they left the cabin,
I... followed them.

38:52.141 --> 38:53.909
Your sister-in-law's
been through enough.

38:53.976 --> 38:55.110
She lost your brother
in Afghanistan

38:55.161 --> 38:56.278
and then her daughter.

38:56.329 --> 38:57.579
It's not fair.

38:57.646 --> 38:59.781
Neither was killing
those two people.

38:59.832 --> 39:01.983
They let him off
with a slap on the wrist.

39:02.034 --> 39:04.002
Counseling.
That's crap!

39:04.086 --> 39:05.653
He needed to pay.

39:05.705 --> 39:07.005
We're both soldiers.
You understand.

39:07.089 --> 39:08.924
I don't. I don't get that.
Come on, man.

39:08.991 --> 39:11.626
When we were over there,
we took care of business.

39:11.677 --> 39:12.844
We didn't wait
for some trial.

39:12.929 --> 39:14.179
What about the woman?

39:14.263 --> 39:15.714
e was defending him,

39:15.798 --> 39:17.966
saying that he turned
his life around.

39:18.017 --> 39:20.001
Collateral damage.
It happens.

39:20.052 --> 39:21.603
This isn't war, Gary.

39:21.670 --> 39:23.521
He killed Sarah.

39:23.606 --> 39:26.091
She never had a chance
to turn her life around.

39:26.158 --> 39:27.309
So you sprayed them
with pepper spray,

39:27.360 --> 39:28.526
and you pushed them
off the cliff.

39:30.229 --> 39:32.364
I did the right thing.

39:32.448 --> 39:36.217
For Sarah and my brother.

39:36.285 --> 39:39.754
Nobody's ever going to tell me
I didn't do the right thing.

they died in each
other's arms.

40:34.543 --> 40:37.012
How could that have made their
deaths any less horrible?

40:37.079 --> 40:38.680
Well, 'cause it was love.

40:38.747 --> 40:41.182
I mean... I mean, if
you're going to go,

40:41.250 --> 40:42.384
it's best to go with
someone you love.

40:42.435 --> 40:43.584
No, but he didn't
have to go.

40:43.636 --> 40:46.321
He could have walked farther
and gotten help.

40:46.389 --> 40:48.089
At least one of them
would have lived.

40:48.140 --> 40:49.357
Well, he couldn't leave her.

40:49.425 --> 40:51.226
All right,
that-that's what love is.

40:51.277 --> 40:54.595
So you're saying that love
is foolish and illogical.

40:54.647 --> 40:57.782
No. It's-it's thinking
of someone before yourself.

40:57.867 --> 40:59.951
It's giving your life,

41:00.019 --> 41:02.103
if necessary,
to that person.

41:02.154 --> 41:03.571
I mean, it's, uh, it's love.

41:03.622 --> 41:05.340
And if a person
falls out of love

41:05.408 --> 41:06.791
and meets someone else?

41:06.876 --> 41:08.910
Those selfless acts
would suddenly appear

41:08.961 --> 41:11.913
to be dangerously
irresponsible, wouldn't they?

41:11.964 --> 41:13.982
No. It was still love.

41:14.050 --> 41:16.751
Well, I could never
live like that.

41:16.802 --> 41:19.120
Survival is the
human imperative.

41:19.171 --> 41:21.506
If we don't look out for
ourselves, nothing else matters.
That's not true.

41:21.590 --> 41:23.958
You know that, Bones. That is...
That's not true. You know that.

41:24.010 --> 41:26.895
You're experiencing a rush
of dopamine, norepinephrine,

41:26.962 --> 41:28.680
and serotonin with Hannah.

41:28.764 --> 41:31.766
Those feelings are wonderful.
I've felt them.

41:31.817 --> 41:33.551
But I won't rely on
the transient nature

41:33.619 --> 41:35.804
of chemicals for my happiness.

41:35.871 --> 41:36.971
Here she is. Wow.

41:37.023 --> 41:38.907
Hey!

41:38.974 --> 41:40.792
Wow. That's
a dress.

41:42.278 --> 41:43.478
Hey, Temperance.

41:43.529 --> 41:44.979
Hello.

41:45.031 --> 41:47.148
So, you guys
catch a bad guy?

41:47.199 --> 41:48.500
Yes.

41:48.584 --> 41:51.202
It was a park ranger with
a perverse sense of justice.

41:51.287 --> 41:52.420
Oh.

41:52.488 --> 41:55.040
So, this is, like,
a post-criminal drink?

41:55.107 --> 41:56.591
Yeah. It's a post...
Y-you want one?

41:56.659 --> 41:59.327
I'll have one.
Or two.

41:59.378 --> 42:01.679
Or three at dinner.
We should go.

42:01.764 --> 42:02.764
We're going to be late.
Yeah, yeah.

42:02.831 --> 42:03.831
We should get going.

42:03.883 --> 42:04.966
Do you want to go?

42:05.017 --> 42:06.334
Oh, no, thanks.

42:06.385 --> 42:08.303
I have to catalog
all the forensics.

42:08.354 --> 42:09.604
Come on. Clark can do it.

42:09.671 --> 42:11.839
I don't mind.
Have a good night.

42:11.891 --> 42:14.526
So, I'll see you
tomorrow, then.

42:14.610 --> 42:17.378
Um, one night,
you and me.

42:17.446 --> 42:18.863
Girls' night out.

42:18.948 --> 42:20.115
We'll dish about Seeley.

42:20.182 --> 42:22.283
Come on, let's go.
