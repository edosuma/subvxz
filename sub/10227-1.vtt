01:06.708 --> 01:08.042
America...

01:11.375 --> 01:13.375
I say to the people of America...

01:16.292 --> 01:20.708
This moment is our chance to...

01:26.583 --> 01:27.542
Enough-

01:29.958 --> 01:33.500
To make of our own lives
what we will. It is...

01:36.958 --> 01:38.417
That pushes us forward.

01:42.458 --> 01:44.500
The American promise alive.

01:45.292 --> 01:48.667
It is that promise that's
always set this country apart.

01:49.375 --> 01:51.375
It's a promise
that says each of us has the freedom...

01:51.458 --> 01:54.167
to make of our own lives what we will.

02:13.625 --> 02:17.542
You're late!
You're fucking 3 hours late!

02:17.625 --> 02:19.750
Don't start on me.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
You couldn't
have gotten me somebody else?

02:22.083 --> 02:24.083
This item looks like shit,
and he's got no fucking manners.

02:24.167 --> 02:25.768
I'm not gonna
put up with shit like this.

02:25.792 --> 02:27.625
All right, look, you asked me
to get somebody that was all right.

02:27.708 --> 02:29.417
You know, Russell here,
he's kind of a wise ass,

02:29.500 --> 02:31.000
but he's all right if you can stand him.

02:31.083 --> 02:33.333
Yeah, and a guy like you,
you want a job done...

02:33.458 --> 02:35.250
you don't
have the balls to do it yourself,

02:35.333 --> 02:37.292
I think you ought to try pretty hard to.

02:38.583 --> 02:42.000
I don't like this guy.
He's too fucking fresh for my blood.

02:42.083 --> 02:44.292
Russell, will you shut the fuck up
and stop jerking the guy's chain?

02:44.375 --> 02:45.542
He's trying to do us a favor here.

02:45.625 --> 02:46.417
He's trying to do us a fucking favor?

02:46.500 --> 02:48.333
Yeah, he's trying to do us a favor.

02:48.417 --> 02:50.792
I thought
he wanted us to do him a favor.

02:51.042 --> 02:55.208
Is that the straight shit, Squirrel?
You trying to do me a favor?

02:55.292 --> 02:56.375
Get the fuck out!

02:56.458 --> 03:00.000
Man, what are you
talking to me like that? Come on.

03:00.125 --> 03:03.083
You sell people dry cleaning
and you talk to them like that?

03:03.500 --> 03:05.208
You know something,
the two guys I get to do this...

03:05.292 --> 03:08.250
they're gonna cut up about 30,
I figure 30K.

03:08.333 --> 03:09.773
And Australians like him. Frankie...

03:10.000 --> 03:12.667
Australians like him
I can buy for 80 cents a dozen.

03:12.750 --> 03:14.500
They throw another one in for free.

03:14.625 --> 03:16.542
So you know what you do, Frankie?
You get me another guy...

03:16.625 --> 03:18.417
cause I'm not gonna
put up with this kind of shit.

03:18.500 --> 03:21.000
Look, John,
it'll be all right, okay? Trust me.

03:21.125 --> 03:23.667
Hey, my friend, you picked
the wrong guy for a thing once.

03:23.750 --> 03:25.583
You remember that?
You remember the doctor?

03:25.667 --> 03:28.333
And I knew, I just knew
that this was the wrong guy.

03:28.417 --> 03:29.697
What do I do? I take him anyway.

03:29.792 --> 03:32.042
John, I need the dough.
Don't fuck around with me like that.

03:32.125 --> 03:35.292
And after 7 years in the can
and my kids are growing up...

03:35.375 --> 03:37.292
and my business isn't doing
what it should be, you know,

03:37.375 --> 03:39.292
I can't get that back.

03:39.375 --> 03:42.667
So from now on, I'm taking
my time and that's all there is to it.

03:42.750 --> 03:44.625
I had my last fuck-up.

03:46.500 --> 03:49.750
Call me Thursday. Thursday I'll know.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.167
I've got to give
a new direction to this economy.

04:12.750 --> 04:15.792
Come on. That a girl. Good girl. Look.

04:16.041 --> 04:19.375
All right, you're here.
So we going out there or what?

04:19.458 --> 04:20.166
That depends.

04:20.291 --> 04:21.166
Don't depend on me.

04:21.250 --> 04:23.208
It's Thursday.
You coming with me or not'?

04:23.292 --> 04:27.250
Man. Fuck that guy. He's a dick.

04:27.333 --> 04:30.667
Doesn't know if he wants me or not.
Well, I don't need him, mate.

04:30.792 --> 04:32.625
I got my own thing going on, mate.

04:32.708 --> 04:36.083
Me and Kenny, you know,
we're snatching these dogs...

04:36.500 --> 04:39.083
purebreds,
and selling 'em down in Florida.

04:39.167 --> 04:41.000
I got 5 grand in the kit, mate.

04:41.083 --> 04:44.333
When I get 7, I'm gonna go
and buy an ounce of smack...

04:44.625 --> 04:46.583
and I'm gonna become a dealer.

04:46.667 --> 04:49.583
Plus this afternoon...

04:49.667 --> 04:52.042
I got a girl I can go and fuck.

04:52.750 --> 04:53.667
Right?

04:53.750 --> 04:57.542
So I'm thinking it's a choice,
you know. Oh, tough one.

04:57.625 --> 04:59.042
Am I gonna go and fuck a girl

04:59.125 --> 05:01.500
or am I gonna go to a meeting
with the Squirrel?

05:01.625 --> 05:03.625
Oh, fuck a girl, meeting with Squirrel.

05:03.708 --> 05:06.500
Fuck Squirrel.
I think I'll go fuck the girl.

05:08.125 --> 05:09.542
I'd like to see this girl.

05:09.625 --> 05:11.792
The kind of girl you can
screw off an ad in the paper?

05:12.042 --> 05:15.208
Beautiful. Probably got a couple
of handfuls of broken glass in there.

05:15.292 --> 05:18.583
Well, yeah, these girls, you see 'em...

05:18.667 --> 05:19.708
you probably wouldn't want to rape them,

05:19.958 --> 05:22.583
but all the plumbing works just fine.

05:28.542 --> 05:30.333
So I guess you're not coming then.

05:30.417 --> 05:34.583
Look, go ahead, see if you can
get him to tell you anything about it.

05:34.667 --> 05:37.542
If you still like it then, then I'm in.

05:37.625 --> 05:41.333
If not, if he doesn't want me, I'm out.

05:41.458 --> 05:43.125
But I'm not wasting an afternoon on it.

05:43.208 --> 05:45.208
That much, I'm not doing.

05:47.417 --> 05:50.000
- There it is.
- All right, fuck it.

05:53.042 --> 05:56.000
I don't know. I've been asking around
about him, you know and...

05:56.083 --> 05:57.083
I mean, not too many people.

05:57.167 --> 05:58.125
Now I don't want
everybody to think that...

05:58.208 --> 05:59.208
maybe I got something in mind

05:59.292 --> 06:02.458
and well, nobody knows this guy.

06:02.750 --> 06:06.333
I'm afraid he's not the kind of guy
we want to have in with us.

06:07.458 --> 06:08.792
See, these people
are not the kind of people

06:09.042 --> 06:10.167
that are around a bank or something.

06:10.250 --> 06:12.625
They expect maybe someday some guy's
gonna come in there and rob them

06:12.708 --> 06:14.125
and it's not their money.

06:14.208 --> 06:16.000
These are not
these kind of people at all.

06:16.125 --> 06:18.333
They see somebody come in there
that's not absolutely cool...

06:18.458 --> 06:21.042
that they can tell right off
doesn't know what he's doing...

06:21.125 --> 06:23.333
they're liable,
some of them to get up off their ass

06:23.458 --> 06:25.083
and start making trouble.

06:25.167 --> 06:26.500
They're gonna fucking shoot somebody,

06:26.583 --> 06:27.792
for Christ's sake,
and I don't want that.

06:28.042 --> 06:29.522
There's no reason for that, you know?

06:29.542 --> 06:31.208
You don't get any more money
or anything like that.

06:31.292 --> 06:32.458
It don't make any sense.

06:32.542 --> 06:36.292
Yeah, I don't mean anything.
At least you got an idea, you know?

06:36.375 --> 06:38.000
You still coming up dry'?

06:38.083 --> 06:40.042
Yeah. You know what I did?

06:40.125 --> 06:41.167
I goes down to probation,

06:41.292 --> 06:43.375
like I actually believe in all that shit
they're handing out there.

06:43.458 --> 06:44.498
"Here's something for you.

06:44.500 --> 06:46.250
Place in Halbrook needs assemblers..."

06:46.333 --> 06:48.667
"$130 a week,
4:00 to midnight, steady work."

06:48.750 --> 06:51.417
"It'll keep you
out of trouble." Beautiful.

06:51.500 --> 06:53.375
Well, I live in Somerville.

06:53.458 --> 06:56.042
How the hell am I gonna get to
Halbrook in the middle of the afternoon?

06:56.125 --> 06:57.926
Never mind,
for Christ's sake, how the fuck...

06:57.958 --> 06:59.292
am I gonna get home
in the middle of the night?

06:59.375 --> 07:02.417
"Buy a car."
"With what? I haven't got no money."

07:02.500 --> 07:04.000
What the fuck am I gonna buy a car with?

07:04.083 --> 07:06.583
Why the fuck they think
I need a job in the first place?

07:06.667 --> 07:07.667
Fucking assholes.

07:07.792 --> 07:10.000
You know, then I see Russell.
You know, he's coming right along.

07:10.083 --> 07:13.125
You know, probably buy himself
a hotel in the next couple weeks or so.

07:13.208 --> 07:14.292
Not on dogs.

07:14.375 --> 07:15.458
He's just doing that.

07:15.542 --> 07:18.167
He's gonna use that to buy
some stuff, soon as he gets enough.

07:18.292 --> 07:19.458
He's gonna get nabbed.

07:19.542 --> 07:22.375
He ought to go in the drugstore
and buy himself a new toothbrush

07:22.458 --> 07:24.167
cause he's gonna need it.

07:24.292 --> 07:26.332
Well, John, you know,
you're the guy with the angle.

07:26.333 --> 07:28.292
Tell me what the angle is.

07:33.458 --> 07:36.458
You think dog-lover there
can handle a card game?

07:37.792 --> 07:40.625
Shit, those fucking things?
Those things are protected.

07:40.708 --> 07:43.068
You can't do those things
unless you're so fucking stupid...

07:43.125 --> 07:45.667
you actually like everybody
going around trying to off you.

07:46.250 --> 07:47.333
There's one you can do.

07:47.417 --> 07:50.083
John, there's 10 I can do.
I know of at least 10 I can do..

07:50.167 --> 07:51.250
But then after, I'm gonna have

07:51.333 --> 07:53.333
at least 8 hot ginzos out
looking for me.

07:53.458 --> 07:56.000
No, no, not this one,
because the minute it fucking happens..

07:56.125 --> 07:58.167
They're gonna know right off who did it.

07:58.250 --> 07:59.167
For some reason, John,

07:59.292 --> 08:00.708
that don't
make me feel better, you know.

08:00.792 --> 08:03.232
No, not us. They're not even
gonna be thinking it might be us.

08:03.292 --> 08:04.292
They're gonna pick one guy right away...

08:04.417 --> 08:06.458
go whack him out
and that's gonna be end of it.

08:06.542 --> 08:11.000
You and I are gonna cut up about
$40,000, $50,000, no fucking sweat.

08:11.625 --> 08:14.417
I don't know how I goes for
setting somebody up, you know?

08:14.500 --> 08:17.083
You're not setting him up.
He set himself up.

08:17.167 --> 08:18.542
Markie Trattman runs this game.

08:18.625 --> 08:19.792
This is Markie's second game.

08:20.042 --> 08:22.208
The first one got knocked over...

08:22.292 --> 08:24.458
and it was Markie who did it.

08:25.583 --> 08:28.625
See, four years ago.
Markie was running this game...

08:28.708 --> 08:31.375
and he sees all the cash
flying around the room...

08:32.625 --> 08:36.125
and he thinks... "Jeez, two guys
with shotguns and stocking masks..."

08:36.207 --> 08:38.332
could come in here and really clean up."

08:38.625 --> 08:41.542
So he thinks,
"What the fuck," and he does it.

08:42.457 --> 08:45.167
Put your hands on the fucking table
with your fucking money!

08:45.250 --> 08:47.792
Mike, all right, all right,
give him the money. Go, Mike!

08:48.042 --> 08:50.562
Now all the games have to shutdown.
It's a real pain in the ass.

08:50.583 --> 08:53.083
Total fucking economic collapse.

08:53.750 --> 08:55.333
Everyone's pissing and moaning.

08:55.458 --> 08:59.333
No one's got any money.
Everybody's, you know, really upset.

09:00.250 --> 09:01.750
Fuck me.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.042
Markie!

09:05.250 --> 09:07.708
They send Dillon out to find out
who did it.

09:09.167 --> 09:10.667
The fuck are you looking at'?

09:11.458 --> 09:12.500
Markie!

09:13.292 --> 09:14.583
What?

09:15.750 --> 09:17.208
And Dillon interrogates Markie.

09:17.292 --> 09:18.667
- Hey, What's going on? Hey!
- Hey.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.667
You knock over the card game?

09:21.625 --> 09:25.042
Jesus Christ! What the fuck'?

09:27.250 --> 09:28.417
Dillon!

09:30.083 --> 09:31.603
And Markie holds up under questioning.

09:31.625 --> 09:35.000
Dillon, what the fuck'?
What's this all about?

09:35.083 --> 09:37.333
Dillon can't work it out
who did it, so they think...

09:37.417 --> 09:39.583
"What the fuck.
It's just one of those things."

09:39.667 --> 09:41.167
Let's have a beer.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.542
What the fuck, man?

09:43.625 --> 09:45.500
Stop crying-

09:45.583 --> 09:48.458
So eventually, the games start up again.

09:50.208 --> 09:53.792
Everything's getting back to normal,
everyone's making money again...

09:54.042 --> 09:55.375
and everyone's happy.

09:59.083 --> 10:01.583
One night, they're all sitting around
and they're talking about...

10:01.667 --> 10:03.583
"Remember the time
when all the games were shutdown...

10:03.667 --> 10:06.625
and everyone's hearing footsteps
and what a fucking drag?"

10:06.708 --> 10:08.708
Yeah, yeah, that was horrible.

10:08.958 --> 10:11.042
And Markie starts laughing.

10:12.167 --> 10:13.750
He can't help himself.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.792
You know what?

10:16.042 --> 10:19.000
He tells them it was him
that robbed his own game.

10:19.792 --> 10:20.667
I did it!

10:20.750 --> 10:22.542
And everyone thinks it's funny.

10:22.625 --> 10:23.333
Where was I'?

10:23.417 --> 10:26.000
What the hell, it really
wasn't their money that was stolen...

10:26.583 --> 10:29.667
and everyone loves Markie,
so they give him a pass.

10:31.542 --> 10:32.667
But if it happens again,

10:32.750 --> 10:35.125
if Markie's game gets knocked over...

10:35.208 --> 10:36.500
they're gonna know it was Markie

10:36.583 --> 10:39.000
and Markie's gonna take the fall for it.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.667
All right, well, fuck it. I'm in.
What about Russell?

10:42.792 --> 10:44.333
I don't give a rat's ass.
You can go in there with...

10:44.458 --> 10:47.583
fucking Tarzan and his fucking
spotted jockstrap for all I care...

10:47.667 --> 10:49.250
if you can get him to do it.

10:49.625 --> 10:51.667
But this thing's gotta move, all right'?

10:51.792 --> 10:54.750
All right with me. Look,
I gotta do something soon.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.250
If I don't think of something
soon, I'm gonna have...

10:56.333 --> 10:58.333
to go back and knock
on a gate and say, "Let me back in."

10:58.417 --> 11:00.167
I can't think of nothing
it's starting to get cold

11:00.250 --> 11:01.333
Because just a matter of time...

11:01.417 --> 11:03.250
some other fresh bastard's
gonna think of this...

11:03.333 --> 11:05.667
and then it's gonna be gone,
we don't have the money.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.625
We're not the only smart guys
in the world.

11:09.125 --> 11:11.125
Fuck, this a good car you got.

11:11.208 --> 11:14.292
It's like the lounge room,
mate, but it's a good car.

11:14.375 --> 11:17.250
Yeah, I wish you could
still get a car like this.

11:17.333 --> 11:18.625
Keep this one.

11:18.708 --> 11:21.583
Yeah, that's just
what I need is a nice, hot car.

11:23.167 --> 11:24.447
You're not getting any, are you?

11:24.458 --> 11:27.167
Go fuck yourself. Tomorrow night,
I'm getting some. All right'?

11:27.250 --> 11:30.083
You know, if this thing goes all right,
this is my last night a priest.

11:30.167 --> 11:32.000
Fucking take care of my own hog.

11:32.625 --> 11:35.542
You certainly had a bunch of practice
at taking care of your own hog.

11:35.625 --> 11:37.417
Yeah, that's real fucking nice talk.

11:37.500 --> 11:40.167
A guy like you,
sticking it in Goat-Ass' satchel.

11:40.292 --> 11:41.583
Fucking really nice talk.

11:41.667 --> 11:44.208
Hey, we're in jail, you know.

11:44.292 --> 11:48.708
Rule number one,
find yourself a lovely, clean older man.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.542
Who the fuck told you
that Goat-Ass was clean'?

11:51.625 --> 11:52.333
Rule number two

11:52.417 --> 11:55.667
if you can't find that lovely,
clean older man...

11:55.750 --> 11:57.542
take the dirty one.

11:57.625 --> 11:59.000
You're fucking sick.

11:59.125 --> 12:02.333
You know, we shoulda actually
had them get you a goat, you know.

12:02.458 --> 12:04.818
Have 'em bring it into the jail
and you could fuck the goat.

12:05.042 --> 12:06.792
You know,
I had some clout with the keepers.

12:07.333 --> 12:08.500
Oh, those poor dogs.

12:08.625 --> 12:10.417
You sure you're not
fucking around with those dogs?

12:10.500 --> 12:14.417
No, no, 'cause they're dogs,
they bite, you know.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.583
I mean, I'll give you some advice, mate.

12:16.667 --> 12:20.000
Don't-not with a dog, you know.

12:20.125 --> 12:22.417
They can nip, from what I hear...

12:22.500 --> 12:25.458
and that's very painful,
from what I hear.

12:25.542 --> 12:27.750
You know, you're better off
with women, mate...

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
if you can get yourself one, that is.

12:30.125 --> 12:32.625
Well, maybe I'm not sure I can.

12:32.708 --> 12:36.333
They're around.
There's broads just like us, mate.

12:36.417 --> 12:38.667
Just as crazy as us too.

12:38.750 --> 12:42.333
Like this one, she's beautiful,
mate, but she's crazy.

12:42.458 --> 12:44.083
She's crazy.

12:44.167 --> 12:47.042
Let me tell you, all right.
I go up to the house, okay?

12:47.125 --> 12:48.583
I've got a hard-on already.

12:48.667 --> 12:53.000
She opens the door and, fuck, mate,
she was completely naked, you know.

12:53.083 --> 12:56.167
I got quite nervous, mate,
'cause it's been a while, you know.

12:56.250 --> 12:58.667
And she's like, "Well, are you
gonna come and fuck me..."

12:58.750 --> 13:00.111
or you gonna stand there all day?"

13:00.125 --> 13:02.333
So I take her in there. I fuck her.

13:02.417 --> 13:04.667
It's really, let me tell you...

13:04.792 --> 13:05.542
she fucked like

13:05.625 --> 13:09.583
a fucking crazy alien
from the planet Gobble, you know?

13:10.958 --> 13:13.667
She started moaning and gobbling, mate.

13:13.792 --> 13:15.500
I mean, really going crazy,

13:15.625 --> 13:17.542
just like the cock goes in and...

13:20.958 --> 13:25.000
So roll off, done, oh, fantastic.

13:25.083 --> 13:27.333
Next words out of her mouth,

13:27.458 --> 13:29.667
"I'm gonna kill myself."

13:30.375 --> 13:32.083
They all say that.

13:32.417 --> 13:35.250
That's the first thing they think
of to say, you know, a lot of them.

13:35.333 --> 13:37.292
Yeah, it don't mean anything.

13:38.500 --> 13:40.083
Yeah.

14:00.292 --> 14:01.542
Here you go, man.

14:03.333 --> 14:06.167
Jesus, that's what you fucking got,
dishwashing gloves?

14:08.417 --> 14:10.625
Look, you take
what you can fucking get, all right'?

14:10.708 --> 14:13.000
These fucking things are too thick.

14:13.125 --> 14:14.667
It's what they had.

14:14.792 --> 14:16.750
They might
had some fucking latex gloves...

14:17.000 --> 14:19.167
from, like,
a fucking hospital or something.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.417
You'll make do.

14:24.750 --> 14:25.792
There you go.

14:26.042 --> 14:28.417
Jesus, the fuck is this?

14:29.167 --> 14:30.208
What does it look like?

14:30.292 --> 14:32.667
It's a fucking sawn-off shotgun, okay?

14:32.792 --> 14:34.500
It's what you asked me
to fucking get you.

14:34.583 --> 14:36.167
I mean, you asked me for this, mate.

14:36.292 --> 14:37.708
We shoot somebody
with this fucking thing...

14:37.958 --> 14:39.958
it's gonna kill everybody
in the fucking room.

14:40.083 --> 14:41.750
Well, tell them that.

14:43.167 --> 14:45.417
We're gonna look like a bunch of
fucking amateurs when we go in there.

14:45.500 --> 14:46.708
Take a breath.

14:46.958 --> 14:49.042
All right, you ready to do this?

14:52.000 --> 14:53.375
You don't even have your glove on.

14:53.458 --> 14:54.208
I got my fucking glove on.

14:54.292 --> 14:56.292
Just shut the fuck up.

14:56.417 --> 14:57.500
You shut the fuck up.

14:57.625 --> 14:59.583
You know. I'm going out there
with a fucking hand grenade...

14:59.667 --> 15:01.708
and there's a fucking condom on my hand.

16:03.167 --> 16:05.667
All right, hands, hands,
hands, all of you, hands!

16:05.792 --> 16:07.583
Get your fucking hands up.

16:17.333 --> 16:18.333
Okay.

16:45.292 --> 16:47.458
I hope you guys know what you're doing.

16:59.208 --> 17:00.542
Should I get the money?

17:08.458 --> 17:10.416
Just take it easy.

17:24.083 --> 17:25.791
Hands, hands!

17:44.583 --> 17:46.500
You stop fucking looking at me.

17:56.750 --> 18:00.333
Stop fucking looking at me
Get your fucking hands up.

18:02.792 --> 18:04.708
You know they're gonna kill you.

18:07.333 --> 18:09.208
You know that, don't you?

18:13.208 --> 18:15.250
That doesn't have to happen.

18:16.083 --> 18:18.167
It shouldn't happen to you.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.167
You should just put the gun down...

18:25.458 --> 18:29.167
turn around and walk out the front door.

18:29.750 --> 18:31.708
I'll take care of your friend.

18:33.375 --> 18:36.458
I ain't gonna fucking tell you again,
you stop fucking looking at me.

18:36.542 --> 18:38.375
Don't worry about him.

18:38.458 --> 18:40.500
I'll take care of him for you.

18:40.625 --> 18:42.500
What's going on in there?

18:44.000 --> 18:45.333
Come on, now.

18:46.292 --> 18:48.042
Hands, hands, hands!

18:49.167 --> 18:51.292
Get your fucking hands up!

18:57.625 --> 18:59.042
What's going on in there?

19:01.583 --> 19:03.583
Talk to me! What's going on in there?

19:09.333 --> 19:11.292
You sure you want to do this?

19:19.083 --> 19:21.042
All right, put it on the table.

19:29.125 --> 19:31.000
You want me to sit down'?

19:49.000 --> 19:50.208
Nice.

19:51.750 --> 19:53.625
All right, you motherfucker,
give it up right now!

19:53.708 --> 19:55.708
You got the money. Leave him alone.

19:55.958 --> 19:57.500
Hey, take out what you got in
your pockets and put it on the table.

19:57.625 --> 19:59.458
Hey, leave the poor bastard alone!

19:59.542 --> 20:00.750
You got all the money.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.333
Hey, shut the fuck up!

20:02.417 --> 20:05.167
- Leave the fucking bastard...
- You shut the fuck up!

20:13.958 --> 20:15.458
All right, you fucking cocksucker...

20:15.542 --> 20:18.625
get your fucking money out of
your pockets and put it on the table...

20:18.708 --> 20:21.333
nice and fucking slow.

20:21.458 --> 20:23.750
All right, you fucking prick.

20:24.500 --> 20:27.167
All right, now you.
Put it on the fucking table...

20:27.292 --> 20:31.000
nice and fucking slow. Stop fucking
looking at me. Hey, get your hands up!

20:31.125 --> 20:33.333
Not you yet. Get your fucking hands up!

20:33.417 --> 20:35.583
Get your fucking hands
out of your pocket!

20:37.500 --> 20:39.458
All right, now,
there's two ways we can do this.

20:39.542 --> 20:41.417
There's the easy way and the hard way.

20:41.500 --> 20:44.042
All right, the easy way is to do what
these two guys are doing.

20:44.125 --> 20:46.042
All right, the hard way is to
make us come around and all...

20:46.125 --> 20:48.000
which is gonna make him nervous.
Now you can sit there...

20:48.083 --> 20:49.542
and act like you haven't
got it in your sock

20:49.625 --> 20:50.542
or something, but then after...

20:50.625 --> 20:53.292
me and my nervous friend
are gonna come around and make sure.

20:53.375 --> 20:54.708
And for all the guys
that didn't remember everything...

20:54.958 --> 20:57.583
we're gonna knock every
last one of their fucking teeth out.

20:59.583 --> 21:01.292
How's that?

21:06.083 --> 21:08.667
Good. That's the way I feel too.

21:08.750 --> 21:12.500
All right, the less guys that get hurt,
the better, so don't fuck around.

21:13.625 --> 21:16.625
Just keep quiet and give it
all up and nobody gets hurt.

21:17.292 --> 21:18.292
It's only money.

21:18.375 --> 21:19.375
Good evening.

21:19.458 --> 21:23.042
This is an extraordinary period
for America's economy.

21:23.125 --> 21:25.167
Over the past few weeks,
many Americans have

21:25.292 --> 21:28.708
felt anxiety about
their finances and their future.

21:28.958 --> 21:31.792
I understand their worry
and their frustration.

21:32.042 --> 21:34.583
We've seen triple-digit swings
in the stock market.

21:34.667 --> 21:36.750
- All right, do it.
- Major financial institutions

21:37.000 --> 21:38.750
have teetered on the edge of collapse...

21:39.000 --> 21:40.500
and some failed.

21:41.125 --> 21:42.292
As uncertainty has grown,

21:42.375 --> 21:44.667
many banks have restricted lending...

21:44.750 --> 21:46.667
credit markets have frozen...

21:46.750 --> 21:50.583
and families and businesses
have found it harder to borrow money.

21:50.667 --> 21:54.292
We're in the midst
of a serious financial crisis...

21:54.375 --> 21:58.042
and the federal government
is responding with decisive action.

21:58.125 --> 22:01.542
We boosted confidence
in money market mutual funds.

22:21.292 --> 22:24.042
I know many Americans
have questions tonight.

22:24.125 --> 22:26.667
How did we reach
this point in our economy?

22:26.792 --> 22:29.292
How will the solution I propose work?

22:29.375 --> 22:33.500
And what does this mean
for your financial future?

22:33.583 --> 22:37.667
These are good questions
and they deserve good answers.

22:37.750 --> 22:40.292
First...

23:02.750 --> 23:04.500
Go, go, go, go.

24:28.792 --> 24:31.667
They told me when they heard that
if Dillon wasn't available...

24:31.792 --> 24:35.083
that I was supposed to talk
to the fella he sent. Is that you?

24:35.625 --> 24:38.750
I don't see nobody else
who might be here to meet you. Do you?

24:43.792 --> 24:45.417
Let's get out from
under these construction guys.

24:45.500 --> 24:47.708
- Bang a right and go a couple blocks.
- Most of the Republicans we know

24:47.958 --> 24:50.417
doesn't like this bill
and President Bush,

24:50.500 --> 24:54.625
I mean he's in the position now
of trying to sway public opinion...

24:54.708 --> 24:56.500
and build support for it.

24:56.583 --> 24:59.708
With the situation becoming
more precarious by the day...

24:59.958 --> 25:01.667
I face the choice to

25:01.750 --> 25:04.667
step in with dramatic
government action...

25:04.750 --> 25:05.583
or to stand back

25:05.667 --> 25:08.333
and allow
the irresponsible actions of some...

25:08.417 --> 25:11.792
to undermine
the financial security of all.

25:12.042 --> 25:14.083
There has been
a widespread loss of confidence.

25:14.167 --> 25:14.750
Left.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
And major sectors
of America's financial system are

25:18.125 --> 25:20.125
at risk of shutting down.

25:20.542 --> 25:22.625
The government's top
economic experts warn that...

25:22.708 --> 25:25.083
without immediate action by Congress...

25:25.167 --> 25:27.167
America could slip into
a financial panic. -So,

25:27.250 --> 25:29.083
they were very concerned
when I told them...

25:29.167 --> 25:30.768
I called Dillon, Dillon said to see you.

25:30.792 --> 25:32.125
They're very concerned.

25:32.208 --> 25:33.708
How is the fella?

25:33.958 --> 25:36.042
Not good. Saw him yesterday.

25:36.125 --> 25:38.292
He said he feels like somebody
stuck a knife in his chest.

25:38.375 --> 25:41.000
So he probably won't be able to
handle anything for a while.

25:41.125 --> 25:42.792
He sure can't right now.

25:43.958 --> 25:46.333
Personally,
I think the guy's in very bad shape.

25:47.125 --> 25:49.042
Go under the bridge and you can park.

25:58.750 --> 26:03.333
So, Mark Trattman's game
was hit a couple of nights ago.

26:04.667 --> 26:05.667
I heard that.

26:05.750 --> 26:07.583
Yeah, two kids.

26:07.667 --> 26:08.583
Yeah?

26:08.667 --> 26:11.167
You or Dillon hear anything
about two kids?

26:11.250 --> 26:14.083
We hear lots of things. I heard
they had masks on, for one thing.

26:14.167 --> 26:15.083
Correct.

26:15.167 --> 26:17.250
So maybe they're not kids.

26:17.333 --> 26:20.125
Well, they were dressed like kids,
dungarees.

26:20.208 --> 26:22.750
Smelled like animals, Trattman said.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.750
Trattman said.

26:25.708 --> 26:30.417
Well, Trattman also said that the one
who talked had a voice like a kid's.

26:30.500 --> 26:32.333
Trattman said.

26:34.292 --> 26:35.667
Well as far as I know...

26:35.792 --> 26:39.333
there's nothing wrong with Trattman's
hearing or his nose or anything.

26:40.625 --> 26:43.625
No, nothing I've heard about, anyways.

26:48.750 --> 26:52.167
So where do we go from here?
What do you think?

26:54.125 --> 26:55.625
It could have been Trattman.

26:55.750 --> 26:57.208
He coulda decided to do it again.

26:57.292 --> 27:00.167
No one'd ever think
he's dumb enough to do it twice.

27:00.292 --> 27:03.333
But I know Markie. He's not that dumb.

27:03.458 --> 27:06.708
So I figured some other smart guys
knew he did it before.

27:06.958 --> 27:08.500
For now, it don't matter.

27:08.625 --> 27:10.083
It doesn't?

27:10.167 --> 27:13.000
We start with Trattman.
We start real good too.

27:13.125 --> 27:15.625
- Wait a minute.
- I'll wait a week if you want.

27:15.750 --> 27:19.167
No, I don't understand.
I thought you believed him.

27:19.292 --> 27:20.500
My friend, I do.

27:20.625 --> 27:22.542
But the games are closed, right'?

27:23.375 --> 27:24.625
Grant's Tomb.

27:24.708 --> 27:26.292
People are losing money.

27:26.375 --> 27:27.292
A fair inference.

27:27.375 --> 27:29.333
They don't like to lose money.

27:29.417 --> 27:31.458
We hit Trattman,
get things started up again...

27:31.542 --> 27:34.083
get people back to doing
what they're supposed to be doing.

27:34.167 --> 27:36.625
They want to find out
if he did it first.

27:37.125 --> 27:39.583
It don't make a bit of difference
if Trattman did it...

27:39.667 --> 27:41.417
or someone did it to Trattman.

27:41.500 --> 27:42.792
If people think he did it

27:43.042 --> 27:44.375
and he's still walking around...

27:44.458 --> 27:47.667
you're gonna have kids waiting in line,
knock them fucking games over.

27:48.708 --> 27:51.708
They just want you to talk to him.

27:52.333 --> 27:54.042
Talk to him?

27:55.375 --> 27:57.292
What does that mean?

27:57.708 --> 28:00.500
Talk to Trattman, see what he says.

28:01.167 --> 28:02.333
Talk to him?

28:02.417 --> 28:04.667
Really talk to him.

28:07.958 --> 28:09.667
A beating?

28:14.292 --> 28:16.083
How badly they want him beaten?

28:16.167 --> 28:17.625
Shove him around a little...

28:17.708 --> 28:20.083
you know, but don't hurt him too badly
'cause they don't want him hurt.

28:20.167 --> 28:23.000
Oh, of course you do.
You guys, you always do that.

28:23.125 --> 28:23.542
All right.

28:23.625 --> 28:24.500
Quit shitting me, all right'?

28:24.625 --> 28:26.125
- All right.
- Stop the bullshit.

28:26.250 --> 28:27.542
All right, it's stopped.

28:27.625 --> 28:29.125
But why?

28:29.250 --> 28:30.667
What's he gonna do,
fold under questioning?

28:30.792 --> 28:32.500
If he does, they'll kill him.

28:32.583 --> 28:33.167
If he doesn't,

28:33.292 --> 28:35.732
they'll figure he's lying like
last time and they'll kill him.

28:35.750 --> 28:37.792
Either way, Markie's dead.

28:38.125 --> 28:40.333
So why put the poor bastard
through a beating?

28:40.458 --> 28:41.667
It's a waste of time...

28:41.750 --> 28:44.792
not to mention a really
unpleasant experience for Markie.

28:45.042 --> 28:47.708
Just put him out of his misery,
poor bastard.

28:47.958 --> 28:49.708
What's the problem?

28:50.375 --> 28:53.333
It's murder and they are squeamish.

28:53.417 --> 28:56.375
Oh, for fuck's sake.
Who's running things?

28:56.458 --> 28:59.125
You have no idea.

29:00.167 --> 29:02.250
No decision-makers.

29:02.792 --> 29:05.292
I got to take them by the hand
and I got to walk them...

29:05.417 --> 29:08.375
slowly through it like
they're retarded children.

29:08.458 --> 29:09.667
What is it, a committee?

29:09.792 --> 29:11.667
Total corporate mentality.

29:13.750 --> 29:15.625
Christ's sake.

29:16.375 --> 29:19.125
This country is fucked, I'm telling you.

29:19.458 --> 29:21.333
There's a plague coming.

29:25.625 --> 29:28.667
Today we are taking decisive actions...

29:28.792 --> 29:31.333
to protect the US economy.

29:31.667 --> 29:34.500
We regret having to take these actions.

29:34.625 --> 29:38.500
Today's actions are not
what we ever wanted to do...

29:38.625 --> 29:41.333
but today's actions
are what we must do...

29:41.458 --> 29:44.750
to restore confidence
in our financial system.

29:46.042 --> 29:48.208
Today I'm announcing...

29:48.292 --> 29:51.333
that the treasury
will purchase equity stakes.

29:54.583 --> 29:56.750
It's this gray
one right here on the left.

29:57.417 --> 29:58.792
That's where he lives?

29:59.042 --> 30:00.333
Yep.

30:05.375 --> 30:07.375
Jackie, that prick.

30:07.458 --> 30:08.458
Jackie's all right.

30:08.583 --> 30:11.083
He's a mean little prick.

30:11.458 --> 30:15.250
But we gotta deal with
Markie's fucking feelings, not him.

30:15.333 --> 30:17.417
Markie's gonna be okay.

30:18.208 --> 30:20.000
He's gonna make it hard on us.

30:20.125 --> 30:21.625
No, he's not.

30:24.375 --> 30:26.375
Yeah, he will. Fuck.

30:28.083 --> 30:30.083
He insists it has to be done..

30:30.167 --> 30:31.417
Without meaningful discussion

30:31.500 --> 30:33.333
or debate or any change...

30:33.458 --> 30:35.083
sort of, you know...

30:35.167 --> 30:38.667
a immediate authorization
for use of financial force.

30:38.792 --> 30:43.083
That is Mr. Paulson's plan,
former head of Goldman Sachs.

30:43.167 --> 30:47.625
We should not be rolled
by our Wall Street exec...

30:47.750 --> 30:51.708
who's masquerading
as Secretary of the Treasury.

30:51.792 --> 30:53.500
Does this remind
anybody of anything...

30:53.625 --> 30:58.042
like the rush into Iraq
on election eve a number of years ago?

30:58.125 --> 31:00.000
It's all too familiar.

31:20.583 --> 31:23.625
There need to be consequences
and there needs to be major change...

31:23.750 --> 31:25.500
- Hey.
- Get in the car, Markie.

31:27.333 --> 31:28.333
For what?

31:28.458 --> 31:31.958
For what?
Get in the fucking car, Markie.

31:32.083 --> 31:34.208
Steve, I didn't do nothing.

31:34.292 --> 31:35.458
You're gonna get in the car.

31:35.542 --> 31:39.333
You know you're gonna get in
the car, so get in the fucking car!

31:42.292 --> 31:43.167
Barry, open the fucking door.

31:43.292 --> 31:44.250
Shoot me.

31:44.333 --> 31:46.125
- I'll fucking shoot you.
- Go on, shoot me.

31:46.208 --> 31:48.167
- Fuck you, Markie.
- Get in the fucking car now!

31:48.250 --> 31:50.000
- Get in the fucking car, motherfucker!
- Get in the fucking car!

31:50.125 --> 31:51.167
You fuck.

31:52.125 --> 31:54.000
Get out of the car, Markie.

31:54.125 --> 31:56.708
Please, Steve,
let me talk this over, okay?

31:56.958 --> 31:59.208
Get out of the car now, Markie.

31:59.292 --> 32:00.708
I didn't do nothing.

32:00.958 --> 32:02.333
I told you, didn't I?

32:02.458 --> 32:04.500
I told you he was
gonna make it hard on us.

32:04.625 --> 32:06.042
Why you gotta do this, Markie?

32:06.125 --> 32:07.208
I mean,
this is hard for us too, you know.

32:07.292 --> 32:08.375
Why you gotta make it hard for us?

32:08.458 --> 32:10.333
Cause I didn't do nothing.

32:10.417 --> 32:11.458
Move, Markie.

32:11.583 --> 32:14.292
Fucking little prick,
just get the fuck out of the car.

32:14.375 --> 32:16.500
- Get the fuck out. Come on!
- Get out of the car, Markie.

32:16.583 --> 32:19.083
He's not speaking fucking Chinese.

32:20.125 --> 32:22.542
Come on, Trattman. Let's go.

32:27.292 --> 32:28.583
Close the fucking door.

32:30.250 --> 32:31.792
Okay, move over here.

32:32.042 --> 32:34.042
Move down there, down there.

32:34.125 --> 32:35.500
By the door.

32:36.208 --> 32:38.792
Jesus fucking Christ.

32:40.250 --> 32:43.000
May my mother get cancer...

32:43.083 --> 32:45.333
I had nothing to do with this.

32:46.375 --> 32:48.250
You can't tell them that?

32:49.458 --> 32:52.125
I know how it looks. I know.

32:52.208 --> 32:55.667
Honest to God, I didn't.

32:58.542 --> 33:00.667
Fuck, Barry.

33:28.125 --> 33:30.000
He's got fucking blood all over me.

33:44.083 --> 33:45.625
Who are the kids, Markie?

33:45.708 --> 33:48.583
I don't know. I don't know.

33:48.667 --> 33:51.042
No, I don't know.

33:52.125 --> 33:54.000
You're making this hard for us, buddy.

33:54.417 --> 33:57.000
Come on, baby. Okay.

33:57.125 --> 33:59.042
- No, no, no.
- Hold your hands.

33:59.125 --> 34:00.792
Markie, I don't want to hit your hands.

34:01.042 --> 34:01.625
Just fucking hit him!

34:01.750 --> 34:03.000
- Turn him around.
- Fucking hit him!

34:03.083 --> 34:04.333
Right there.

34:06.375 --> 34:07.958
Get his hands, Steven.

34:08.083 --> 34:09.750
No, no.

34:19.708 --> 34:22.333
Hey, man. You okay, Markie?

34:22.417 --> 34:24.708
Hey, Markie, you all right'?

34:25.292 --> 34:27.292
Okay, let's give him a try now.

34:32.292 --> 34:33.213
Markie, about the kids,

34:33.292 --> 34:35.292
are you sure you don't know
who those kids are?

34:40.000 --> 34:41.167
You really sure?

34:41.292 --> 34:43.083
I'm sure.

34:43.167 --> 34:44.417
I'm sure, Steve.

34:44.500 --> 34:46.000
Cause I gotta be.

34:46.083 --> 34:46.792
I gotta be sure, Markie,

34:47.042 --> 34:49.292
and you make me stay out here
all night making sure,

34:49.375 --> 34:51.125
I'm not gonna like it.

34:51.708 --> 34:54.250
It's gonna be an awful
long night for you, Mark.

34:55.458 --> 34:57.083
You bastard.

34:58.250 --> 34:59.667
You cocksucker!

35:04.458 --> 35:05.417
What do you say, Steve?

35:05.500 --> 35:06.500
Shut up!

35:06.625 --> 35:08.458
Let's get the fuck out of here.

35:08.542 --> 35:10.083
Fuck.

35:12.083 --> 35:13.000
Steven.

35:13.125 --> 35:14.000
What?!

35:14.125 --> 35:15.500
Get in the car.

35:59.250 --> 36:02.208
You fucking dirty fucking dog.

36:05.500 --> 36:06.708
Hey, asshole.

36:06.958 --> 36:10.000
Look at you! Look at you!

36:10.125 --> 36:10.625
How are you?

36:10.708 --> 36:13.333
Oh, you look fucking ridiculous.

36:13.458 --> 36:15.167
- Look at your fucking hair.
- Go fuck yourself.

36:15.292 --> 36:17.125
- What are you talking about?
- What spray shit did you put in it?

36:17.208 --> 36:19.417
It ain't spray. I'm not fucking queer.

36:19.500 --> 36:21.333
There's gel on it, you fucking prick.

36:21.417 --> 36:22.208
- You sure you're not...
- Yeah, the guy...

36:22.292 --> 36:23.792
- a little bit of a queer?
- that out it gave me the stuff.

36:24.042 --> 36:26.167
Oh, look at this. New car.

36:26.292 --> 36:27.500
Oh, what the fuck is that?

36:27.583 --> 36:29.500
It's dog shit. Come on, let's go.

36:29.583 --> 36:31.583
Let's go, come on. I've got to get home.

36:31.667 --> 36:34.707
Russell, you fucking smell like shit.
You're not getting in my car like that.

36:34.708 --> 36:37.583
You smell like shit too, like gay shit.

36:37.667 --> 36:40.542
Look at this.
Everything's going good. Shut up.

37:26.375 --> 37:28.000
It was beautiful.

37:28.750 --> 37:32.583
Yeah, we leave in the middle
of the night, for fuck's sake.

37:33.083 --> 37:34.583
All the way to Florida,

37:34.667 --> 37:37.750
we're in this fucking rainstorm.

37:38.000 --> 37:42.292
The dogs are all pissing
and farting and shitting...

37:43.458 --> 37:46.500
and we can't roll the windows down.
We don't want to drown.

37:46.625 --> 37:49.500
Put the fucking window...
what are you, an asshole?!

37:49.625 --> 37:51.625
Put the fucking cigarette out!

37:52.542 --> 37:56.000
It was awful.
It was like riding in a shithouse.

37:56.375 --> 38:00.375
And then after got over to Orlando
we're gonna burn the oar...

38:00.458 --> 38:04.458
so Kenny sticks a rag
in the gas tank, and he lights it off.

38:04.583 --> 38:07.417
You're gonna need to get a stick.
Don't do it by hand, mate.

38:07.500 --> 38:09.667
Don't be a such...
Russell, you're a fucking pussy.

38:09.792 --> 38:11.667
I've done it a million fucking times.

38:13.542 --> 38:16.583
It's fine. It goes up like
a fucking bonfire. I love it.

38:19.292 --> 38:20.542
See?

38:31.625 --> 38:32.625
Fuck!

38:35.583 --> 38:39.125
Kenny, he didn't
have no eyebrows left...

38:39.250 --> 38:41.000
not much hair...

38:41.458 --> 38:43.958
and no sense of humor either.

38:44.292 --> 38:48.000
You know, I thought dogs was gonna
be an easy way to make money.

38:48.125 --> 38:49.625
I was half right.

38:50.208 --> 38:52.208
You look all beat to shit.

38:52.292 --> 38:53.500
Yeah.

38:53.583 --> 38:58.000
And the thing of it is,
I've been up for a week, all right...

38:58.083 --> 39:01.458
and I got to keep going
until I finish this thing off.

39:01.542 --> 39:03.125
What, you haven't dumped the stuff'?

39:03.208 --> 39:07.000
Dumped it? Christ, no.
I haven't stepped it yet.

39:07.125 --> 39:09.333
Look, I put it to a guy fast,

39:09.458 --> 39:12.292
I'm gonna no more than 15 or 16.

39:12.375 --> 39:15.042
I take it up a step...

39:15.125 --> 39:19.292
I can move it to two guys for 25.

39:19.375 --> 39:23.333
Russell, it's stupid.
It's fucking stupid.

39:23.458 --> 39:26.458
That's a thousand dollars a year.

39:27.625 --> 39:30.375
Oh, you're as dumb as I am.

39:30.458 --> 39:33.625
Maybe you think we were
smart doing that other thing...

39:33.708 --> 39:35.375
but we were dumb.

39:36.583 --> 39:38.792
That worked out beautiful.

39:39.042 --> 39:43.750
Oh, sure, fucking cheesecake.

39:44.000 --> 39:48.292
Course, we got a contract out on us.

39:48.375 --> 39:51.750
But, yeah, beautiful.

40:03.042 --> 40:05.208
What the fuck are you talking about?

40:12.500 --> 40:14.375
The fuck you talking about?

40:15.583 --> 40:17.167
Russell?

40:18.125 --> 40:19.625
Russell?

40:19.750 --> 40:21.167
He)'

40:22.125 --> 40:24.250
What the fuck are you talking about?

40:27.083 --> 40:31.125
There's a contract on us,
you, me and the Squirrel.

40:31.250 --> 40:34.667
I'm gonna be as dead
as you guys if I hang around here.

40:34.750 --> 40:36.667
I'm going to Montreal.

40:38.250 --> 40:39.708
For what?

40:42.042 --> 40:44.542
Hey. For what?

40:46.583 --> 40:48.167
For what?

40:48.292 --> 40:50.250
Cut the shit, for the Trattman game.

40:50.333 --> 40:52.083
What the fuck's the matter with you?

40:52.167 --> 40:54.500
Russell, Trattman's practically dead.

40:54.583 --> 40:56.375
They beat him shitless.

40:56.667 --> 40:58.583
You didn't know that, did you?

40:59.542 --> 41:02.500
Course I did. Kenny told me.

41:04.750 --> 41:06.500
Kenny?

41:09.583 --> 41:12.083
Is this Kenny Gill we're talking about?

41:14.750 --> 41:18.625
Hey, Russell, is this Kenny Gill
we're talking about?

41:21.708 --> 41:23.583
Russell, wake up!

41:25.167 --> 41:26.125
What'd you say?

41:26.208 --> 41:29.083
Is this Kenny Gill we're talking about?

41:29.167 --> 41:30.750
Yeah.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.458
Russell, Kenny Gill works for Dillon.

41:35.500 --> 41:38.042
Kenny Gill works for Dillon!

41:39.042 --> 41:39.792
SQ?

41:40.042 --> 41:41.922
So you go talking to
a fucking guy that works...

41:41.958 --> 41:45.792
Fucking guy that works
for fucking Dillon.

41:46.458 --> 41:49.167
So fucking what?

41:49.792 --> 41:52.000
What else did you tell him?

41:52.083 --> 41:53.000
What did you tell him,

41:53.083 --> 41:56.125
in case Kenny didn't get
the whole fucking story before?

41:57.042 --> 41:59.500
I didn't say shit.

42:33.375 --> 42:35.333
Now aside from Squirrel...

42:35.417 --> 42:37.667
we got the kids, two kids.

42:37.792 --> 42:39.458
One of them is the motor mouth.

42:39.542 --> 42:41.333
Drove to Florida with Kenny...

42:41.458 --> 42:43.333
Kenny Gill, our Kenny,

42:43.417 --> 42:44.958
guy he knows works for Dillon...

42:45.083 --> 42:47.000
and starts bragging about
how he's a big-time operator

42:47.083 --> 42:49.208
just knocked over
this guy's game for 100K.

42:49.292 --> 42:50.125
You serious?

42:50.208 --> 42:51.458
I don't know what it is with these guys.

42:51.542 --> 42:53.792
They can't keep
their mouth shut about nothing.

42:54.042 --> 42:57.167
And Kenny, Kenny's just as dumb.

42:57.792 --> 42:59.583
The way I found out was...

42:59.667 --> 43:02.042
this guy's invested his money
in a couple ounces of smack...

43:02.125 --> 43:03.167
wants Kenny to come in with him.

43:03.292 --> 43:05.708
Kenny comes to me and wants
know what I think about that.

43:06.333 --> 43:08.208
I guess these guys,
they just want to go to jail...

43:08.292 --> 43:10.167
probably feel at home there.

43:10.250 --> 43:13.500
So you want to move now
or you want to wait, what?

43:14.333 --> 43:16.667
I talked to Dillon. We both think now.

43:16.750 --> 43:17.542
Okay.

43:17.625 --> 43:19.226
Whack Trattman,
get the games started up.

43:19.292 --> 43:21.292
Trattman,
what brings Trattman into this?

43:21.375 --> 43:24.750
You just told me that it was...

43:25.000 --> 43:26.601
this Squirrel fella and his two friends.

43:26.667 --> 43:30.333
It is, plus I had Trattman
talked to, I'm sure. -Yeah.

43:30.417 --> 43:32.417
You ought to be. Your boys
went a little overboard there.

43:32.500 --> 43:33.583
They damn near killed the man.

43:33.667 --> 43:34.667
It wasn't my idea.

43:34.750 --> 43:36.551
Waste of time, I said.
Waste of money, I said.

43:36.625 --> 43:38.083
Why put Markie through it, I said.

43:38.167 --> 43:39.750
You know, he called me up.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.333
I had trouble understanding him.
Hell, I had trouble calling him back...

43:42.417 --> 43:44.250
cause he got
my secretary the first time.

43:44.333 --> 43:47.042
She couldn't understand him,
the numbers he left.

43:47.125 --> 43:48.583
He's got a broken jaw.

43:48.667 --> 43:50.292
- I heard that.
- Got broken ribs...

43:50.417 --> 43:52.625
he got a broken nose,
three or four broken teeth.

43:52.708 --> 43:56.125
There's some question about
his spleen, he said.

43:56.625 --> 43:58.500
He was in the hospital
when I talked to him.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.333
He's out now, I understand.

44:00.417 --> 44:02.000
Must be his spleen's okay then.

44:02.125 --> 44:03.500
You know, he's not happy, though.

44:03.583 --> 44:06.208
I'm sorry to hear that
We aim to please.

44:06.958 --> 44:08.125
That's what I'm supposed to tell them?

44:08.208 --> 44:10.500
Tell them whatever you want.
Won't make a bit of difference anyways.

44:10.583 --> 44:12.263
Trattman's got to be hit,
and they know it.

44:12.292 --> 44:14.042
You know, you see...

44:14.125 --> 44:16.500
I don't...

44:16.583 --> 44:18.792
I don't understand that, I mean.

44:19.042 --> 44:21.125
Do I have to explain this twice'?

44:22.333 --> 44:24.417
What do you think the guys
on the street think?

44:24.500 --> 44:26.042
I got no idea.

44:26.125 --> 44:28.083
They think Trattman...

44:28.167 --> 44:31.333
he did it before and now he did it again
and all he got was beat up.

44:31.417 --> 44:34.333
But he didn't really do anything.

44:34.417 --> 44:38.167
It's his responsibility. He did it
before and now it happened again...

44:38.292 --> 44:40.167
so he's responsible for what guys think.

44:40.292 --> 44:43.292
On the street, it's Trattman,
nothing but Trattman.

44:44.792 --> 44:47.667
Look, there's no two ways
about it, counselor.

44:47.750 --> 44:50.333
Trattman's gotta be hit.
He made a mistake.

44:54.167 --> 44:55.292
Oh, wait a minute. I get it.

44:55.375 --> 44:58.333
I see what you mean,
the public angle and all.

44:59.542 --> 45:00.750
Okay.

45:01.583 --> 45:03.042
Okay.

45:04.167 --> 45:08.000
Okay, if they agree with you,
assuming that...

45:10.250 --> 45:12.167
can you hit Trattman?

45:13.125 --> 45:14.542
Sure.

45:14.625 --> 45:17.042
Now what about
this Squirrel fella because...

45:17.125 --> 45:20.000
he seems like
the leading candidate to me.

45:20.083 --> 45:22.292
Probably not.
I need Mickey for that one.

45:22.375 --> 45:24.792
Mickey? New York Mickey?

45:25.042 --> 45:26.583
Why can't you handle it?

45:26.667 --> 45:30.000
Cause Squirrel knows me.
Didn't I say that already?

45:30.125 --> 45:32.286
He needed something done once,
Dillon couldn't do it...

45:32.292 --> 45:34.000
so I did it, so he knows me.

45:34.083 --> 45:35.750
He's gonna figure if...

45:36.250 --> 45:38.411
he's waiting on somebody,
he's waiting on me or Dillon.

45:38.458 --> 45:39.792
So what?

45:40.292 --> 45:41.458
You ever killed anyone?

45:41.542 --> 45:43.042
No.

45:43.625 --> 45:45.375
It can get touchy-feely.

45:45.458 --> 45:47.042
Touchy-feely?

45:47.417 --> 45:50.333
Emotional, not fun, a lot of fuss.

45:50.417 --> 45:52.167
They cry, they plead, they beg...

45:52.292 --> 45:54.792
they piss themselves,
they call for their mothers.

45:55.333 --> 45:57.000
It gets embarrassing.

45:58.333 --> 46:00.375
I like to kill them softly...

46:01.125 --> 46:03.708
from a distance,
not close enough for feelings.

46:03.958 --> 46:06.167
Don't like feelings.
Don't want to think about them.

46:06.250 --> 46:08.167
You need Mickey. What's the problem?

46:08.250 --> 46:09.792
Mickey is expensive.

46:10.042 --> 46:11.500
Not at the moment.

46:12.625 --> 46:14.250
You get him for 10?

46:15.500 --> 46:16.292
He'd do it for 15?

46:16.375 --> 46:17.792
15, asshole.

46:18.042 --> 46:20.000
I think in this economy
a quick 16 for two days work...

46:20.125 --> 46:22.042
would sound pretty good to Mickey.

46:23.125 --> 46:24.250
We'll sell him a party.

46:24.333 --> 46:27.000
Fly in, whack a guy, fly out, quick 15.

46:27.708 --> 46:29.292
Fly coach.

46:42.792 --> 46:46.500
America's financial system
is intricate and complex.

46:46.583 --> 46:48.417
But behind all the technical terminology

46:48.500 --> 46:50.583
is a critical human factor.

46:52.792 --> 46:54.292
Confidence.

46:57.333 --> 46:59.542
Confidence in our financial systems
is essential...

46:59.625 --> 47:02.167
to the smooth operation
of our economy...

47:02.292 --> 47:05.292
and recently
that confidence has been shaken.

47:07.583 --> 47:10.167
All of us have a responsibility
to solve this crisis...

47:10.292 --> 47:11.167
because it affects

47:11.250 --> 47:14.667
the financial well-being
of every single American.

47:14.792 --> 47:18.375
The House of Representatives
failed to act on Monday.

47:18.458 --> 47:23.417
We saw the single largest decline
in the stock market in two decades.

47:23.500 --> 47:24.542
But in the end of the day,

47:24.625 --> 47:29.250
there's no real separation... between
Wall Street and Main Street.

47:29.333 --> 47:32.292
There's only the road
we're traveling on as Americans...

47:32.375 --> 47:34.458
and we will rise or fall on that journey

47:34.542 --> 47:36.583
as one nation, as one people.

47:36.667 --> 47:38.292
Hey, come here.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.625
So where'd you have to go for these?

47:41.458 --> 47:42.667
Sir?

47:43.625 --> 47:46.417
I said, where did you
have to go for these?

47:48.292 --> 47:49.708
Out of the building, right'?

47:51.167 --> 47:53.687
What, you have to walk a couple blocks,
take a cab or something?

47:53.792 --> 47:57.500
No, sir, we only have one man
on service today and he's very busy.

47:58.500 --> 47:59.540
Are the drinks all right'?

47:59.542 --> 48:02.542
No, as a matter of fact, they're mostly
evaporated by the time you get here.

48:02.625 --> 48:04.583
Mickey. Yeah, the drinks are all right.

48:04.667 --> 48:05.708
Bring me another one.

48:05.958 --> 48:07.167
Yes, sir.

48:10.958 --> 48:13.417
You mind if I drink
that beer while I'm waiting for...

48:13.500 --> 48:15.708
Lurch to get back
from the airport over here?

48:17.208 --> 48:19.167
Make you fat, though,
I thought you said.

48:19.292 --> 48:20.542
Yeah.

48:35.667 --> 48:38.500
So they grabbed me down in Maryland
on this gun thing.

48:38.625 --> 48:40.292
What gun thing?

48:40.375 --> 48:43.333
Well, I was going hunting,
for Christ's sake.

48:43.750 --> 48:47.208
Me and this guy, Topper.
You know Topper?

48:47.292 --> 48:48.625
- No.
- Nice guy.

48:48.708 --> 48:51.167
Anyway we were going down
to Maryland to hunt geese...

48:51.250 --> 48:53.083
down at Maryland shore.

48:54.000 --> 48:55.667
Then we go down there and...

48:55.792 --> 48:58.042
all of a sudden there's a couple
hundred cops all over the place...

48:58.125 --> 49:00.125
and I got the shotgun in the trunk.

49:00.458 --> 49:01.958
Fucking beautiful.

49:02.458 --> 49:04.333
Fucking shotgun,
I just bought the fucking shotgun.

49:04.458 --> 49:06.250
I never even used it once.

49:06.958 --> 49:09.125
Now, I'm under arrest...

49:09.208 --> 49:11.083
felony possession,

49:11.167 --> 49:13.000
so I might go to jail
for a fucking shotgun...

49:13.125 --> 49:17.000
I bought in a fucking store to hunt
fucking geese with, for Christ's sake.

49:17.125 --> 49:18.333
Jesus.

49:22.667 --> 49:24.583
Did you bring him a beer?

49:24.667 --> 49:27.208
No, sir, he only wanted the one,
I thought.

49:28.250 --> 49:29.333
What?

49:29.458 --> 49:31.667
He only wanted one drink, I thought.

49:31.792 --> 49:33.708
I'm drinking his beer.

49:34.292 --> 49:35.083
I'm drinking the man's beer.

49:35.167 --> 49:36.927
- Get him a beer.
- I don't want another one.

49:37.458 --> 49:38.750
It's all right.

49:42.458 --> 49:44.125
All right, don't have no more.

49:46.042 --> 49:46.802
So, yeah, Topper...

49:47.000 --> 49:49.281
You're hitting that stuff pretty hard,
aren't you, Mickey?

49:52.625 --> 49:54.208
I can handle it.

49:56.583 --> 49:59.167
So, Topper, yeah, Topper...

49:59.292 --> 50:02.042
he feels responsible and,
you know, he's an old guy.

50:02.125 --> 50:04.083
He hasn't been pinched
in about 30 years.

50:04.167 --> 50:06.500
So we figure
the shotguns are gonna be his.

50:06.625 --> 50:09.750
I'm just doing the old man a favor
driving him down there and all.

50:12.083 --> 50:13.708
Yeah, but if they don't...

50:15.333 --> 50:16.750
I do time.

50:18.042 --> 50:20.625
If the shotguns aren't his, I do time.

50:20.750 --> 50:22.417
It's that simple.

50:25.542 --> 50:28.750
Done it before. I can do it again.

50:29.375 --> 50:31.250
Rough on the wife, though.

50:31.667 --> 50:33.167
Yeah.

50:37.625 --> 50:40.333
The last time,
she actually took out the papers.

50:43.000 --> 50:44.625
I didn't blame her.

50:45.583 --> 50:47.792
She's been through it twice before.

50:51.667 --> 50:54.042
So the papers come up.
I was gonna sign them, you know...

50:54.125 --> 50:56.205
let her have what she wants
if that's what she wants.

50:56.250 --> 50:57.667
The girl don't owe me nothing.

50:59.542 --> 51:01.583
But I asked her to come up.

51:01.667 --> 51:05.000
I says, "Margie, do this for me.
Don't do nothing now."

51:05.125 --> 51:08.625
Do like when I come out
the last time and decide then."

51:09.958 --> 51:11.500
She looks at me.

51:11.958 --> 51:13.625
She says, "And you promised me then..."

51:13.708 --> 51:15.909
She says. "And you promised me
then you were through..."

51:16.000 --> 51:18.167
and here I am again
and I'll wait five more years...

51:18.250 --> 51:20.292
and I'll be five more years older...

51:20.417 --> 51:23.167
"and you're gonna get out again
and you're gonna do something else."

51:26.375 --> 51:29.792
And I said, "Margie, I mean,
what can I say? You're right."

51:30.042 --> 51:32.458
You're right,
but all I'm asking you to do...

51:32.542 --> 51:34.625
"is wait till I come out again."

51:35.083 --> 51:37.208
Cause I don't know who the guy is.

51:38.958 --> 51:40.458
But I did.

51:40.583 --> 51:43.000
I did. I knew she was seeing somebody.

51:43.125 --> 51:46.000
I knew two days after
she was with him the first time...

51:46.083 --> 51:49.750
and I didn't like the feeling it gave me
in my nuts knowing it.

51:51.375 --> 51:53.333
But I didn't blame him.

51:56.958 --> 51:59.125
Anyway, I said, "Margie..."

52:00.125 --> 52:02.208
you ought to do this for me.

52:02.292 --> 52:05.500
I ought to be around the same as him...

52:06.000 --> 52:08.667
"because you and me,
we always got along all right."

52:13.042 --> 52:16.625
Then she started crying
and shaking her head and...

52:17.500 --> 52:20.458
I thought, you know...

52:21.625 --> 52:23.375
But she didn't.

52:24.750 --> 52:26.542
And it was all right.

52:31.292 --> 52:32.792
You're not having any more of those.

52:33.042 --> 52:34.625
You'll fall on your ass if you do.

52:35.708 --> 52:38.708
I was drinking before you
got out of your father's cock.

52:38.958 --> 52:40.542
Don't tell me what I do.

52:45.458 --> 52:48.292
Next time, you know,
she takes out the papers...

52:50.167 --> 52:52.000
I'm just gonna sign them...

52:52.792 --> 52:55.167
because it's too fucking rough on me.

52:57.042 --> 52:58.542
Check.

52:58.625 --> 53:01.042
Terrible amount of shit
you got to go through.

53:03.042 --> 53:04.500
What are you gonna do?

53:05.792 --> 53:07.667
Do the best you can.

53:09.292 --> 53:11.583
What, am I gonna leave the country like
some fucking draft dodger or something?

53:11.667 --> 53:13.292
Fuck that.

53:15.958 --> 53:20.625
Besides, none of this shit
means anything anyway.

53:28.458 --> 53:30.417
It's all bullshit.

53:39.208 --> 53:40.667
So what are we doing?

53:48.292 --> 53:49.750
We got two guys.

53:50.000 --> 53:50.667
Actually, there's four guys,

53:50.792 --> 53:53.542
but it takes fucking forever
to get the okay around here.

53:53.625 --> 53:56.292
So we got two guys for sure

53:56.375 --> 53:59.667
and one them knows me, so here you are.

54:01.292 --> 54:03.500
So, what, you want me
to do a double or what?

54:04.125 --> 54:07.125
You want to take the double,
it's all right with me. You need that?

54:10.125 --> 54:12.625
Look, I ought to
take you up on it, but...

54:12.708 --> 54:14.208
I'm not supposed to
be up here, you know.

54:14.292 --> 54:17.000
I'm restricted in New York
and Maryland and all that shit.

54:18.208 --> 54:20.500
I want to go anywhere,
I'm supposed to ask them.

54:20.625 --> 54:22.625
Well, I didn't ask them.

54:25.458 --> 54:28.458
So I probably shouldn't be up here
anymore than I have to, you know.

54:30.250 --> 54:32.250
Besides, a double's risky.

54:36.250 --> 54:37.750
I'll just take the one.

54:38.000 --> 54:39.250
Okay.

54:39.625 --> 54:42.542
Now, here's the thing.
That's gonna be the guy that knows me.

54:42.625 --> 54:43.792
The other guy, I'm doing.

54:44.042 --> 54:46.442
I'm gonna put his light out tonight
if everything goes right.

54:54.208 --> 54:55.333
Fuck.

55:00.667 --> 55:02.292
What are we gonna do, Jackie?

55:03.250 --> 55:05.000
Never mind thinking about
what I'm gonna do.

55:05.083 --> 55:07.083
You just think about
what you're gonna do.

55:08.125 --> 55:10.083
I'm gonna make some money, right'?

55:10.167 --> 55:13.583
500, same as always.
500, you don't fuck anything up.

55:13.667 --> 55:15.500
When did I ever fuck
anything up with you?

55:15.625 --> 55:18.042
Kenny, the world's full of guys
that never fucked up...

55:18.125 --> 55:20.125
and then they fucked up once
and now they're doing time...

55:20.250 --> 55:23.292
so tonight's not the night to start,
not when I'm with you.

55:25.000 --> 55:26.792
I never fucked anything up.

55:37.458 --> 55:38.667
Where's the fucking car'?

55:38.792 --> 55:39.667
It's around the side. I thought you said

55:39.792 --> 55:40.667
Never mind what you thought I said.

55:40.750 --> 55:42.417
Move your big, dumb ass.
He's going home.

55:42.500 --> 55:43.250
I don't get it.

55:43.333 --> 55:45.667
Yeah, neither is he tonight.
Never again, either.

55:46.167 --> 55:48.767
Come on, for Christ's sake.
I want to get home early for a change.

55:49.625 --> 55:51.250
Put the dollar back.

55:51.333 --> 55:55.083
Put it back. For fuck's sake.

55:55.167 --> 55:58.708
America has the most talented,
productive...

55:58.958 --> 56:00.667
and entrepreneurial
workers in the world.

56:14.458 --> 56:17.792
Right up easy, nice and smooth.

56:26.792 --> 56:28.500
Right up next to him. Kenny...

56:29.208 --> 56:31.417
and a little bit ahead.
Put me right up next to him.

58:33.250 --> 58:37.167
The first one, she wasn't bad.

58:37.292 --> 58:40.042
She wasn't good, but she wasn't bad.
She was all right.

58:40.625 --> 58:42.750
She seemed like she was
in an awful hurry, though.

58:43.000 --> 58:46.125
Honey, could you zip me up?

58:47.208 --> 58:49.000
No.

58:50.375 --> 58:52.083
I thought you were kidding.

58:52.167 --> 58:54.750
No. Get your trick to do it.

58:55.000 --> 58:57.333
You know, screwing's no different
than anything else.

58:57.458 --> 58:59.542
Nobody gives a good shit anymore.

58:59.625 --> 59:00.708
You hire somebody to do something,

59:00.958 --> 59:03.000
you tell them
you're willing to pay for it...

59:03.125 --> 59:05.500
they say they'll do it and they have to.

59:05.625 --> 59:07.083
Yeah, well, for a guy
who's been having himself

59:07.167 --> 59:08.292
a regular party for three days or

59:08.417 --> 59:10.417
so you sure bitch and moan a lot.

59:10.500 --> 59:13.125
I've been paying for it.
I can bitch about it if I want.

59:16.167 --> 59:18.125
So you know this broad Polly?

59:18.208 --> 59:19.375
Honey?

59:20.125 --> 59:22.292
Oh, it's on the nightstand over there.

59:22.417 --> 59:24.250
The wallet's on the nightstand.

59:26.125 --> 59:28.125
Yeah, everybody knows Polly.

59:28.208 --> 59:30.250
Yeah, that's what the first broad
you sent up said.

59:30.333 --> 59:32.708
There's $283 in there, okay?

59:32.958 --> 59:35.667
When I get up, I want to
see $183 in there, you got that?

59:35.750 --> 59:38.458
Okay. No tip?

59:39.167 --> 59:41.000
No tip.

59:41.125 --> 59:42.333
You're the original sport.

59:42.417 --> 59:43.708
Fuck her.

59:45.958 --> 59:48.125
You want a tip, honey?
I'll give you a tip.

59:48.208 --> 59:50.167
You put the condom on with your mouth...

59:50.250 --> 59:53.458
and you stop acting like your anus
is a national treasure.

59:53.542 --> 59:55.458
You're a fucking hooker
for Christ's sake.

59:55.542 --> 59:56.500
Fuck you.

59:59.458 --> 01:00:01.000
Let me tell you something, honey.

01:00:01.125 --> 01:00:04.417
One day
one old bastard that you milked...

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:06.667
he's gonna carve you up,
talking like that.

01:00:08.042 --> 01:00:09.708
How would you like that?

01:00:09.958 --> 01:00:12.125
Jesus, I don't know.

01:00:12.208 --> 01:00:13.750
You think I'd come?

01:00:14.292 --> 01:00:17.000
If you could, maybe you would.

01:00:17.125 --> 01:00:18.625
But I'm thinking no.

01:00:19.542 --> 01:00:20.792
Fuck you.

01:00:23.458 --> 01:00:26.208
Which is pretty much what I had in mind
when she come up here.

01:00:32.292 --> 01:00:35.208
You know, I haven't had a real piece
of ass since Florida.

01:00:36.583 --> 01:00:39.333
- Sunny.
- Sunny. Yeah.

01:00:42.708 --> 01:00:45.667
You probably fucked her too
didn't you, after I left?

01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:47.292
Mickey.

01:00:47.375 --> 01:00:49.417
When me and Dillon got there,
she was with you.

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:51.125
When we left, she was still with you.

01:00:51.250 --> 01:00:52.708
You were there, what?

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:54.333
Three weeks.

01:00:54.417 --> 01:00:55.458
Three weeks.

01:00:55.583 --> 01:00:58.042
I was there five days in the middle.

01:00:58.125 --> 01:01:00.208
How the fuck am I gonna do that?

01:01:02.458 --> 01:01:04.000
I don't know.

01:01:06.708 --> 01:01:08.167
Empty again.

01:01:09.958 --> 01:01:11.792
You sure you won't join me?

01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:14.625
Not late enough yet either.

01:01:23.542 --> 01:01:25.292
Sammy fucked her.

01:01:25.375 --> 01:01:26.667
Guy from Detroit,

01:01:26.792 --> 01:01:28.125
sharp-looking little ginzo?

01:01:28.208 --> 01:01:29.792
He's a fucking Jew.

01:01:32.292 --> 01:01:34.292
All those years I knew that guy...

01:01:35.667 --> 01:01:39.500
he fucking did it anyway, scumbag.

01:01:42.458 --> 01:01:44.083
Son of a bitch.

01:01:49.083 --> 01:01:51.208
I don't know why I care about this.

01:01:53.375 --> 01:01:56.083
I mean, you know. I know when...

01:01:56.167 --> 01:02:00.000
I'm there, I'm there, she's with me...

01:02:00.125 --> 01:02:02.500
and when I leave and you're there,

01:02:02.583 --> 01:02:04.292
she's with you.

01:02:04.625 --> 01:02:06.417
She wasn't with me.

01:02:07.458 --> 01:02:10.750
I don't mean you. I mean any guy.

01:02:20.375 --> 01:02:22.417
Yeah, I don't care.

01:02:24.167 --> 01:02:25.292
It's not like I love her or nothing.

01:02:25.375 --> 01:02:27.667
You know,
I just give her for when I'm there.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.750
Fucking Sammy.

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:35.333
Mickey.

01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:40.167
She good, you know, Sunny.

01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:42.000
She's a good girl.

01:02:43.708 --> 01:02:45.250
If she can't get you up,

01:02:45.333 --> 01:02:46.958
you're probably dead.

01:02:48.292 --> 01:02:49.792
And let me tell you something...

01:02:50.042 --> 01:02:53.792
I've seen every kind
of ass there is in this world.

01:02:54.042 --> 01:02:55.667
Yeah, you've seen it this week.

01:02:55.792 --> 01:02:56.667
You been here, what, three days?

01:02:56.792 --> 01:02:59.167
What I hear, you've seen
most of the ass in town.

01:03:01.292 --> 01:03:05.042
Well, I like it. It's, like, my hobby.

01:03:05.667 --> 01:03:07.375
Yeah, well, I couldn't fuck
like that for three days.

01:03:07.458 --> 01:03:08.958
I get all fucked out.

01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:13.208
You want ass?

01:03:14.125 --> 01:03:17.292
There's no ass in the whole world...

01:03:17.417 --> 01:03:20.000
like a young Jewish girl that's hooking.

01:03:21.958 --> 01:03:23.750
I'm gonna keep that in mind.

01:03:25.333 --> 01:03:27.208
You take that to the bank.

01:03:37.083 --> 01:03:39.000
First time I met Sunny...

01:03:40.333 --> 01:03:43.333
she walked in the room,
I got a fucking enormous hard-on.

01:03:44.125 --> 01:03:47.083
I could have fought five guys
with this fucking prong I had.

01:03:48.417 --> 01:03:52.000
So fucking hard
the skin from under my eyes...

01:03:52.125 --> 01:03:55.167
just kinda went down into the cock
so it could expand.

01:03:55.292 --> 01:03:56.000
Mickey.

01:03:56.125 --> 01:03:58.565
My fucking... you know, after,
I just wanted to fuck her so bad.

01:03:58.625 --> 01:04:00.250
She was so fucking beautiful.

01:04:00.333 --> 01:04:01.292
Mickey.

01:04:01.375 --> 01:04:02.958
- I felt like a man.
- Mick!

01:04:03.083 --> 01:04:05.333
She made me feel good. What?

01:04:07.667 --> 01:04:09.375
You gonna be all right...

01:04:11.375 --> 01:04:14.333
tomorrow night, the next?

01:04:18.958 --> 01:04:22.583
I'm all right now. What the fuck'?
Leave me alone.

01:04:22.667 --> 01:04:24.987
Look, this after, we're supposed to
meet a guy, all right'?

01:04:25.042 --> 01:04:27.458
I got a guy to take you around and all.

01:04:34.250 --> 01:04:36.000
I can't go out.

01:04:39.375 --> 01:04:41.458
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:04:46.083 --> 01:04:47.542
No, I can't go out.

01:04:50.667 --> 01:04:54.000
You come up here to do something
remember? For that.

01:04:55.708 --> 01:04:57.458
All right, go get him.

01:04:57.542 --> 01:05:00.167
Go get the fucking guy
and we'll set this thing up.

01:05:00.292 --> 01:05:02.667
Go get him now!
We'll set the fucking thing up!

01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:03.417
Go get him!

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:06.583
You, I'ma tell you what you're gonna do.
You're gonna go to fucking bed.

01:05:06.667 --> 01:05:09.708
It's 2:30 now, you shit
I'ma call you at 7:30...

01:05:09.958 --> 01:05:11.083
and if I don't wake you up,

01:05:11.167 --> 01:05:13.167
I am gonna drop a dime
on a couple of cops

01:05:13.250 --> 01:05:15.292
I know who are gonna take you back
to where you're supposed to be.

01:05:15.417 --> 01:05:16.667
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah?

01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:18.458
No ass. No more booze.

01:05:18.542 --> 01:05:21.083
No nothing.
Get yourself a shower and go to bed.

01:05:21.167 --> 01:05:23.083
I'll get you up and tell you
where you gotta be.

01:05:23.167 --> 01:05:25.458
I don't take orders from shits like you!

01:05:27.417 --> 01:05:30.667
7:30. Get some sleep.

01:05:31.458 --> 01:05:33.083
He's been here three days.

01:05:33.167 --> 01:05:36.167
What he didn't fuck in them
three days, he drank.

01:05:36.292 --> 01:05:37.452
He was drunk when I left him.

01:05:37.458 --> 01:05:40.000
2:00 in the afternoon and he's drunk.

01:05:40.125 --> 01:05:41.365
And when I chew him out for it,

01:05:41.458 --> 01:05:44.000
he's go out in the skivvies
and do the job now

01:05:44.583 --> 01:05:46.042
Won't fucking shut up.

01:05:46.125 --> 01:05:47.375
You asked for him.

01:05:47.458 --> 01:05:50.083
You said you couldn't do it,
so we got you what you asked for.

01:05:50.167 --> 01:05:52.208
I need the Mickey
from a couple of years ago.

01:05:52.292 --> 01:05:53.373
He's fucking worthless now.

01:05:53.417 --> 01:05:55.000
Did you talk to Dillon about it,

01:05:55.125 --> 01:05:56.926
I mean, or is he even
able to talk to anybody?

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.208
Dillon thinks what I think.

01:05:58.292 --> 01:05:59.625
We need this guy out of town yesterday.

01:05:59.708 --> 01:06:02.250
You invited him here. Send him back.

01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:06.667
Won't go. He needs the dough.

01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:09.083
Well, I can't get in touch
with him today.

01:06:10.417 --> 01:06:12.333
It's not like that.

01:06:13.458 --> 01:06:16.000
What I got in mind,
I'm gonna get him grabbed.

01:06:17.958 --> 01:06:19.542
Won't he talk?

01:06:20.292 --> 01:06:22.500
If he thought it was me who did it,
he might.

01:06:24.208 --> 01:06:25.625
Let's just say
in about a day from now...

01:06:25.708 --> 01:06:29.500
he's gonna get into a fight with a whore
in a hotel that don't like whore fights.

01:06:30.125 --> 01:06:31.125
He's gonna get busted for that.

01:06:31.208 --> 01:06:33.000
They'll revoke his bail,
and back he'll go.

01:06:33.083 --> 01:06:35.000
Kind of rough on him.

01:06:35.792 --> 01:06:37.750
Actually,
I think it's the best thing for him.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.500
Won't get enough potato jack
in the can to kill him.

01:06:40.625 --> 01:06:43.042
And if he's not in the can,
he's going to kill us.

01:06:43.667 --> 01:06:45.458
So how much is the girl gonna cost'?

01:06:45.542 --> 01:06:46.667
$500, maybe a grand.

01:06:46.792 --> 01:06:47.792
Oh, Jesus.

01:06:48.042 --> 01:06:48.625
It's a grand.

01:06:48.708 --> 01:06:50.583
Yeah, well, I still got to okay it.

01:06:50.667 --> 01:06:53.042
You know, this running back to them
every time with the latest bad news...

01:06:53.125 --> 01:06:54.333
they're raising hell with me.

01:06:54.458 --> 01:06:55.708
Well, we got a little problem.

01:06:55.958 --> 01:06:59.208
We weren't supposed to have
any little problems, no problems at all.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.417
Please don't smoke in my car, please.
Come on.

01:07:28.625 --> 01:07:30.667
All right, looks like
our boy finally made it.

01:07:35.542 --> 01:07:38.125
Yeah, I've got him now.
He's about to enter the building.

01:07:58.667 --> 01:08:00.375
All units, this is unit three.

01:08:00.458 --> 01:08:02.667
He's headed
to the lockers on the west side.

01:08:55.582 --> 01:08:57.582
You have the right to remain silent.

01:09:01.542 --> 01:09:03.582
You have any guns, knives
or anything else I should know about...

01:09:03.667 --> 01:09:05.346
needles or anything
I'm gonna get stuck on?

01:09:05.375 --> 01:09:06.667
I dunno, maybe.

01:09:06.750 --> 01:09:08.082
- What?
- Yeah.

01:09:08.167 --> 01:09:10.008
- Yes or no?
- Left pocket, left jacket pocket.

01:09:10.125 --> 01:09:13.375
You have the right to talk to a lawyer
for advice before we ask you questions.

01:09:13.457 --> 01:09:14.167
Don't move that hand.

01:09:14.292 --> 01:09:17.125
If you cannot afford a lawyer,
one will be appointed for you.

01:09:17.207 --> 01:09:19.500
Do you understand
what I've just read to you, sir?

01:09:20.542 --> 01:09:22.125
That poor bastard.

01:09:22.457 --> 01:09:23.582
You know, I knew this was gonna happen.

01:09:23.667 --> 01:09:26.500
I told him, you know.
What the fuck, you know.

01:09:27.082 --> 01:09:28.375
You know, I like the guy.

01:09:28.457 --> 01:09:30.497
You know, he was always
all right to me, you know...

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:32.500
and now I can't do nothing to help him?

01:09:32.582 --> 01:09:34.167
Took his chances.

01:09:34.457 --> 01:09:36.375
Sure John
and you're taking your chances...

01:09:36.457 --> 01:09:37.707
and I'm taking my chances, all right...

01:09:37.957 --> 01:09:39.957
and sooner or later,
they're gonna grab us.

01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:43.625
You know, and then who am I
gonna call, you know, you?

01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:49.707
I haven't got no friends either.
You know, you look at it.

01:09:49.957 --> 01:09:51.792
You, me and Russell are in exactly
the same position...

01:09:52.042 --> 01:09:53.750
except for he's in it now
and we're not in it yet.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.750
Frankie, you gotta relax.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.208
It's like Trattman.

01:09:57.292 --> 01:09:59.292
It come out just like you said.

01:09:59.375 --> 01:10:00.667
You know, when it didn't happen and...

01:10:00.750 --> 01:10:02.083
Russell was telling me
all that stuff, you know...

01:10:02.167 --> 01:10:04.417
I was scared shitless
it wasn't gonna happen.

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:06.417
You know, I thought
it was gonna happen to me.

01:10:06.667 --> 01:10:11.083
You know, that don't mean... well yeah.
I mean, I'm glad it happened to him...

01:10:11.167 --> 01:10:13.708
but I still wish it didn't even
happen to him, you know?

01:10:13.958 --> 01:10:15.583
It didn't have to.

01:10:16.292 --> 01:10:18.292
It's just shit, you know.

01:10:19.292 --> 01:10:21.250
This world is just shit.

01:10:23.125 --> 01:10:25.042
We're all just on our own.

01:10:32.292 --> 01:10:34.542
What the fuck, man, whatcha gonna do?

01:10:34.625 --> 01:10:36.000
Get off my block, bitch!

01:10:36.083 --> 01:10:37.042
This my block!

01:10:37.125 --> 01:10:39.000
I run this motherfucking block!

01:10:39.125 --> 01:10:40.208
Get off my block!

01:10:40.292 --> 01:10:42.000
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?

01:10:42.125 --> 01:10:45.542
I run this show! I run this show!

01:10:45.625 --> 01:10:48.542
What you gonna do, homey?
Get off my fucking block, man!

01:10:48.625 --> 01:10:50.333
Get off my block!

01:10:51.375 --> 01:10:53.708
Our eye now is to the future...

01:10:53.958 --> 01:10:56.583
to shine the bright light
of accountability.

01:10:57.083 --> 01:10:58.333
Can I get you a Bud?

01:10:58.458 --> 01:10:59.792
Yeah.

01:11:00.042 --> 01:11:01.292
Bottle or draft?

01:11:01.375 --> 01:11:02.750
I don't give a shit.

01:11:06.625 --> 01:11:08.333
They always do that.

01:11:08.458 --> 01:11:09.667
Pain in the ass.

01:11:10.208 --> 01:11:12.728
Wouldn't come in here I know
I got to go through shit like that.

01:11:13.458 --> 01:11:14.417
Shit, I would.

01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:17.208
This guy, I don't know how he does it.

01:11:17.292 --> 01:11:20.458
He must have the best-built girls
in town working for him.

01:11:20.542 --> 01:11:22.042
I come in here every day.

01:11:22.125 --> 01:11:23.292
I know.

01:11:26.250 --> 01:11:28.167
I've never seen you in here before.

01:11:28.958 --> 01:11:30.417
Look, I don't know you.

01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:32.250
Very few guys know me.

01:11:32.667 --> 01:11:34.667
I've never been here before in my life.

01:11:39.792 --> 01:11:41.708
I was looking for you.

01:11:43.625 --> 01:11:46.083
A guy told me you come in here
a lot around this time of the day,

01:11:46.167 --> 01:11:47.667
so I came in.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.500
Who's the guy?

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.125
The guy? A friend.

01:11:57.333 --> 01:11:59.167
A friend of yours, actually.

01:12:01.125 --> 01:12:02.500
Who is the friend?

01:12:02.583 --> 01:12:04.000
A friend.

01:12:04.083 --> 01:12:06.083
Your friends
are worried about you, Frankie.

01:12:07.250 --> 01:12:09.625
They think you need somebody around...

01:12:09.708 --> 01:12:12.625
who knows about things, advise you...

01:12:12.708 --> 01:12:15.125
teach you how to cover your ass.

01:12:16.458 --> 01:12:18.333
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:12:18.458 --> 01:12:21.375
See, it's not so much
what you've been doing.

01:12:22.167 --> 01:12:24.333
It's what guys think
you've been doing...

01:12:24.625 --> 01:12:27.000
and that's what you got to look out for.

01:12:27.125 --> 01:12:29.208
And when it happens...

01:12:29.625 --> 01:12:31.625
you got to be prepared to do something.

01:12:33.542 --> 01:12:35.000
Yeah.

01:12:38.625 --> 01:12:41.417
So where's he gonna be tomorrow night?

01:12:43.708 --> 01:12:45.333
Who?

01:12:46.792 --> 01:12:51.125
Johnny Amato. Tomorrow night,
where's he gonna be?

01:12:56.167 --> 01:12:57.500
I don't know.

01:12:57.625 --> 01:12:59.250
Frank.

01:12:59.750 --> 01:13:02.042
You got to keep in mind what I told you.

01:13:02.125 --> 01:13:04.125
Your friends are worried about you.

01:13:04.250 --> 01:13:06.708
It's your friends that want to see you
get a second chance...

01:13:06.958 --> 01:13:08.375
you know what I mean?

01:13:08.458 --> 01:13:11.625
And it's your friends that wanna
know where Squirrel's gonna be.

01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:14.667
Yeah, well, I don't know
who the fuck you are.

01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:16.667
Very few guys do.

01:13:17.625 --> 01:13:19.625
Well, Dillon, maybe.

01:13:21.958 --> 01:13:23.708
Yeah, Dillon knows me.

01:13:27.125 --> 01:13:28.500
Yeah.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.625
You want me to call Dillon for you...

01:13:32.708 --> 01:13:36.125
so you can talk to Dillon
and see who I am'?

01:13:42.625 --> 01:13:44.333
No.

01:13:44.458 --> 01:13:46.500
Okay, then, where's he gonna be?

01:13:53.667 --> 01:13:56.000
I haven't got no idea.

01:14:08.583 --> 01:14:10.042
Okay.

01:14:15.583 --> 01:14:17.542
See you around, Frankie, my friend.

01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:20.792
No, no, hey, wait a minute.

01:14:21.042 --> 01:14:22.792
Fuck you, I don't get paid to wait.

01:14:23.042 --> 01:14:25.792
You tell me you don't know, okay.
I accept that.

01:14:26.042 --> 01:14:29.125
But I got something to do.
I got to find a guy who does know.

01:14:29.250 --> 01:14:31.333
Where John's gonna be tomorrow night?

01:14:32.667 --> 01:14:35.583
Yeah. There's something else now.
I guess...

01:14:36.625 --> 01:14:39.292
like where you're gonna
be the day after.

01:14:44.708 --> 01:14:49.292
Except you're in a position
very few guys ever get in.

01:14:49.417 --> 01:14:53.167
You can do something about it.
You have choices.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.083
I've known very few guys
in a position like that.

01:15:05.667 --> 01:15:08.375
Kid, I hope you don't think
I'm shitting you.

01:15:19.250 --> 01:15:21.375
Kid, I hate to see you go like this.

01:15:22.625 --> 01:15:24.708
And you're going for fucking nothing.

01:15:24.958 --> 01:15:27.458
Jesus, look, I can't do this, like...

01:15:27.542 --> 01:15:30.125
Let me ask you something.
You think about this.

01:15:30.250 --> 01:15:32.458
You think I was to go down
to Wollaston and see him there...

01:15:32.542 --> 01:15:36.458
now and I would say:
"Squirrel, it's you or Frankie...

01:15:36.542 --> 01:15:37.333
who's it gonna be?"

01:15:37.458 --> 01:15:39.059
You think he'd even
think twice about it?

01:15:39.125 --> 01:15:40.500
You think he would?

01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:42.750
I don't know.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:43.792
Asshole.

01:15:44.042 --> 01:15:46.458
Fucking asshole.

01:15:46.542 --> 01:15:48.222
- It's no wonder you did time.
- Look, I...

01:15:48.292 --> 01:15:49.792
I don't have to look.
I know what's going on.

01:15:50.042 --> 01:15:52.500
I know what I gotta do.
I gotta find the right guy.

01:15:52.583 --> 01:15:54.625
Now, make the pick, kid,
and make it now.

01:15:54.750 --> 01:15:56.583
I'm gonna do you a favor.
I'm not gonna do you a favor.

01:15:56.667 --> 01:15:58.458
- It don't matter to me.
- Just let me think.

01:15:58.542 --> 01:16:01.458
Oh, no thinking.
Go or no go right now.

01:16:01.542 --> 01:16:02.458
I gotta get going-

01:16:02.542 --> 01:16:06.375
Fucking Jesus. Look, I don't know
if I can do this, you know.

01:16:06.708 --> 01:16:08.667
Can you do the other thing?

01:16:15.708 --> 01:16:17.208
No.

01:16:18.583 --> 01:16:20.042
Okay.

01:16:20.125 --> 01:16:22.250
So I guess you know then.

01:16:24.375 --> 01:16:25.708
That's the selection.

01:16:31.708 --> 01:16:36.167
All right. So, what do I got to do?

01:16:36.292 --> 01:16:38.167
You got to find out
where Johnny's gonna be.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.250
I already know.

01:16:40.333 --> 01:16:41.667
Yeah?

01:16:42.333 --> 01:16:45.708
He's got a girl.
You know, he told me that before.

01:16:46.542 --> 01:16:48.625
Okay, and where you gonna be?

01:16:50.083 --> 01:16:53.000
I told him I'd be home, I'd be home.

01:16:53.083 --> 01:16:54.042
No, you're not.

01:16:54.125 --> 01:16:54.625
I'm not'?

01:16:54.667 --> 01:16:56.333
- No.
- Where?

01:16:56.458 --> 01:16:59.292
You're gonna be with me
and we're gonna be where he's gonna be.

01:16:59.375 --> 01:17:02.667
Jesus, look, I can't do that.
Look, if he sees me, it's allover.

01:17:02.792 --> 01:17:05.667
He's gonna know something's wrong.
I can't do that.

01:17:05.792 --> 01:17:07.167
I'll tell you...

01:17:07.250 --> 01:17:09.083
Okay, okay.

01:17:09.167 --> 01:17:12.167
So you made
the other choice then I guess.

01:17:16.292 --> 01:17:18.333
Have I really got to do that?

01:17:19.708 --> 01:17:21.417
All of it?

01:17:22.625 --> 01:17:24.458
I got to be there and everything?

01:17:24.542 --> 01:17:27.708
Frank you made a mistake...

01:17:27.958 --> 01:17:31.000
and you got to show you understand
you made a mistake...

01:17:31.125 --> 01:17:33.042
and you gotta make things right...

01:17:34.167 --> 01:17:36.458
otherwise they're gonna
want someone to do something...

01:17:36.542 --> 01:17:38.375
like with Trattman.

01:17:40.333 --> 01:17:42.167
Never did the right thing.

01:18:24.458 --> 01:18:26.458
Jack, he's not a bad guy, you know.

01:18:26.583 --> 01:18:28.333
I mean, he's not a bad guy at all.

01:18:29.125 --> 01:18:32.250
None of them are, kid.
They're all nice guys.

01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:37.375
He was always all right to me.

01:18:37.458 --> 01:18:40.250
Sure, got you almost six years
in the fucking slammer.

01:18:40.333 --> 01:18:42.250
That wasn't his fault.

01:18:42.333 --> 01:18:44.167
Kid when somebody does something...

01:18:44.292 --> 01:18:46.667
and gets somebody else jail for it,
it's his fault.

01:18:46.792 --> 01:18:48.167
That's the rule.

01:18:48.250 --> 01:18:50.167
Well, he didn't mean it.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.292
That's got nothing to do with it,
nothing at all.

01:18:57.750 --> 01:18:59.000
That them?

01:18:59.083 --> 01:19:01.375
No, John's got a Caddy.

01:19:01.458 --> 01:19:04.208
I know what he's got.
What I want to know is, that them?

01:19:04.292 --> 01:19:07.167
Nope. I'd have said it if it was.

01:19:09.333 --> 01:19:12.000
I think you got him all wrong
You know, that jail thing...

01:19:12.125 --> 01:19:13.333
you know, he had it worse than I did,

01:19:13.458 --> 01:19:15.458
you know,
with his family and everything.

01:19:15.542 --> 01:19:17.708
He's never gonna have to do it again.

01:19:40.625 --> 01:19:41.708
That's him.

01:19:41.958 --> 01:19:43.500
I'm not sure.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.625
Yes, you are.

01:20:20.625 --> 01:20:22.500
How long is he gonna be, kid?

01:20:22.625 --> 01:20:24.333
I don't know.

01:20:25.375 --> 01:20:27.333
Okay, I asked you nice.

01:20:27.458 --> 01:20:28.498
Now, does he fuck her here

01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:30.375
or does he fuck her someplace else?

01:20:32.042 --> 01:20:34.000
She's got a roommate.

01:20:34.583 --> 01:20:37.333
He knows a guy that's
got a motel down in Haverhill.

01:20:41.375 --> 01:20:44.583
Okay. It's just gonna be friendly then.

01:20:48.042 --> 01:20:52.625
Look, now, I was gonna get it started
and everything so we could have a start.

01:20:52.708 --> 01:20:54.500
There's probably going to be
a lot of noise and...

01:20:54.583 --> 01:20:57.042
I've known guys, heard a lot of noise...

01:20:57.125 --> 01:20:58.708
got too good a start
and left somebody standing around...

01:20:58.958 --> 01:21:00.542
with their thumb up their ass.

01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:57.458
Fuck, fuck.

01:23:03.292 --> 01:23:04.958
Give me that start, kid.

01:23:20.292 --> 01:23:22.083
Kid, you're going too fast.

01:23:23.375 --> 01:23:25.708
Jesus, they're gonna have
all kinds of cops up in here.

01:23:25.958 --> 01:23:28.167
Yeah, and one of them's
gonna catch you. Slow down.

01:23:31.458 --> 01:23:32.625
Kid.

01:23:34.292 --> 01:23:36.375
Kid, just slow down.

01:23:36.458 --> 01:23:37.458
I can't.

01:23:37.542 --> 01:23:38.500
Kid, you got to.

01:23:38.625 --> 01:23:40.417
Slow the fuck down.

01:23:42.708 --> 01:23:44.583
Kid, my car's in Primrose.

01:23:44.667 --> 01:23:48.125
We got a long way to go.
Just slow the fuck down.

01:23:48.250 --> 01:23:50.167
You want to fucking drive?

01:24:14.708 --> 01:24:16.292
You know what you got to do, right'?

01:24:16.375 --> 01:24:18.333
Sure. I go down to where my car is,

01:24:18.417 --> 01:24:19.708
I leave this one, and I go home.

01:24:19.958 --> 01:24:21.250
Just leave it?

01:24:21.625 --> 01:24:24.667
Christ, I wipe it down.

01:24:27.125 --> 01:24:28.500
You gonna be all right and everything?

01:24:28.625 --> 01:24:30.667
Yeah, I'm gonna be fucking fine.

01:24:34.458 --> 01:24:36.375
Where's your car parked again?

01:24:36.458 --> 01:24:40.000
For Christ's sake,
it's in a lot down on Brownwood.

01:24:40.125 --> 01:24:42.458
Okay, just making sure.

01:24:42.542 --> 01:24:44.292
Sometimes guys forget.

01:24:47.292 --> 01:24:48.958
I fucking got it.

01:24:54.625 --> 01:24:56.042
Okay, you gonna remember now?

01:24:56.125 --> 01:24:58.583
I know, I know.
I dump the fucking car...

01:24:58.667 --> 01:25:02.292
and I don't go too fast
and I wear my fucking seat belt.

01:26:51.125 --> 01:26:53.500
It's the answer spoken
by young and old...

01:26:53.625 --> 01:26:58.042
rich and poor.
Democrat and Republican...

01:26:58.125 --> 01:27:00.167
black, white, Hispanic,

01:27:00.292 --> 01:27:01.958
Asian, Native American,

01:27:02.083 --> 01:27:03.417
gay, straight...

01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:05.667
disabled and not disabled.

01:27:05.792 --> 01:27:09.167
Yes, we're all the same.
We're all equal.

01:27:09.292 --> 01:27:13.167
That we have never been
just a collection of individuals...

01:27:13.250 --> 01:27:16.417
or a collection of red states
and blue states.

01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:21.125
We are and always will be
the United States of America.

01:27:21.208 --> 01:27:22.888
Next he'll be telling us
we're a community,

01:27:23.042 --> 01:27:24.417
we're one people.

01:27:25.083 --> 01:27:28.333
In this country,
we rise or fall as one nation,

01:27:28.458 --> 01:27:30.417
as one people.

01:27:31.250 --> 01:27:33.167
Had yourself quite a party.

01:27:33.625 --> 01:27:36.250
I do the best I can. Beer.

01:27:36.333 --> 01:27:41.208
So everything is under control,
I take it, at long last?

01:27:42.625 --> 01:27:44.292
For someone I'm trying to
help out and everything...

01:27:44.417 --> 01:27:46.458
you're awful hard to get along with.

01:27:46.542 --> 01:27:47.792
Could have made you drive up
to see me, you know...

01:27:48.042 --> 01:27:50.000
I didn't have to come down here.

01:27:50.083 --> 01:27:51.667
Trying to be nice to you.

01:27:51.792 --> 01:27:53.542
You're trying to be nice to me'?

01:27:53.625 --> 01:27:57.042
Sure. I'm a nice guy.
I like to make things easy on people...

01:27:57.125 --> 01:27:58.708
do people favors now and then.

01:27:59.292 --> 01:28:01.667
Do me a favor, don't do me any favors.

01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:03.292
I see how you work.

01:28:03.375 --> 01:28:05.625
Tell you what, just give me the money.

01:28:09.458 --> 01:28:10.625
Excuse me.

01:28:10.750 --> 01:28:12.167
Are you gonna count it?

01:28:12.542 --> 01:28:14.708
I gotta take a leak.
Leave me alone, all right'?

01:28:14.958 --> 01:28:17.000
Have another ginger ale,
for Christ's sake.

01:28:17.125 --> 01:28:20.417
Beyond our shores,
parliaments and palaces...

01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:22.208
those who are huddled around radios...

01:28:22.292 --> 01:28:24.375
in the forgotten corners of the world...

01:28:24.458 --> 01:28:25.667
our stories are singular,

01:28:25.792 --> 01:28:27.958
but our destiny is shared.

01:28:28.083 --> 01:28:30.125
Tonight we proved once more

01:28:30.208 --> 01:28:32.042
that the true strength of our nation...

01:28:32.125 --> 01:28:35.250
comes not from the might of our arms
or the scale of our wealth...

01:28:35.333 --> 01:28:37.750
but from the enduring power
of our ideals...

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:42.750
democracy, liberty,
opportunity and unyielding hope.

01:28:46.333 --> 01:28:50.500
Yes, we can! Yes, we can! Yes we can!

01:28:50.625 --> 01:28:55.292
Yes, we can! Yes, we can! Yes we can!

01:28:58.208 --> 01:28:59.542
Feel better?

01:28:59.625 --> 01:29:02.375
No. There's only 30 in there.

01:29:03.583 --> 01:29:04.625
Three guys.

01:29:04.708 --> 01:29:06.909
Yeah, I had to ask them
if I should pay you for the kid.

01:29:07.042 --> 01:29:09.083
But, you know, they said I should, so.

01:29:09.167 --> 01:29:12.000
They were right too.
That's only ten apiece.

01:29:12.125 --> 01:29:13.125
Correct.

01:29:13.250 --> 01:29:14.667
The price is 15.

01:29:14.750 --> 01:29:17.500
Dillon charges 10.

01:29:17.583 --> 01:29:20.500
Recession prices.
They told me to tell you that too.

01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:24.083
I made a deal with Mickey for 15.

01:29:25.125 --> 01:29:27.667
Yeah, yeah, but the way they got it...

01:29:27.792 --> 01:29:30.000
Mickey got in a fight with a whore
the dumb shit...

01:29:30.125 --> 01:29:32.792
and now they got him in the can
and you're filling in for Dillon...

01:29:33.042 --> 01:29:36.333
and you get what Dillon gets, no more.

01:29:39.292 --> 01:29:42.583
Talk to Dillon. Take it up with him.

01:29:45.083 --> 01:29:46.583
Dillon's dead.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Dillon died this morning.

01:29:56.792 --> 01:29:59.000
They're going to be
very sorry to hear that.

01:29:59.125 --> 01:30:02.167
Sure, sure, they are.
It's gonna cost them more.

01:30:04.125 --> 01:30:06.542
You know, this business
is a business of relationships.

01:30:06.625 --> 01:30:09.292
Yeah, and everyone loved Markie.

01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:14.333
You are cynical bastard, you know that?

01:30:14.417 --> 01:30:16.042
To reclaim the American dream

01:30:16.125 --> 01:30:19.625
and reaffirm that fundamental
truth that out of many,

01:30:19.708 --> 01:30:20.667
we are one.

01:30:20.792 --> 01:30:23.208
You hear that line? Line's for you.

01:30:23.958 --> 01:30:26.708
Don't make me laugh. We're one people.

01:30:26.958 --> 01:30:29.000
It's a myth created by Thomas Jefferson.

01:30:29.125 --> 01:30:31.500
Oh, now you're gonna
have a go at Jefferson?

01:30:31.583 --> 01:30:34.000
My friend.
Jefferson's an American saint...

01:30:34.125 --> 01:30:35.083
because he wrote the words,

01:30:35.167 --> 01:30:37.167
"All men are created equal"...

01:30:37.250 --> 01:30:38.417
words he clearly didn't believe,

01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:41.500
since he allowed his own
children to live in slavery.

01:30:41.583 --> 01:30:43.023
He was a rich wine snob who was sick

01:30:43.125 --> 01:30:44.625
of paying taxes to the Brits...

01:30:44.792 --> 01:30:47.000
so yeah, he wrote some lovely
words and aroused the rabble...

01:30:47.125 --> 01:30:48.885
and they went out
and died for those words...

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.625
while he sat back and drank his wine

01:30:50.750 --> 01:30:52.583
and fucked his slave girl.

01:30:53.792 --> 01:30:56.375
This guy wants to tell me
we're living in a community.

01:30:56.458 --> 01:30:58.375
Don't make me laugh.

01:30:59.292 --> 01:31:00.667
I'm living in America,

01:31:00.792 --> 01:31:02.750
and in America, you're on your own.

01:31:03.542 --> 01:31:07.167
America's not a country.
It's just a business.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.708
Now fucking pay me.
