WEBVTT

00:08.208 --> 00:11.375
(Sheridan)
'Schedule Delta Wing
for maintenance at 1400'

00:11.458 --> 00:12.958
and make sure Conference Room 7

00:13.042 --> 00:15.417
is properly laid out
for the Tikar delegation.

00:15.500 --> 00:17.958
Six yarwood chairs placed
precisely one meter apart

00:18.042 --> 00:21.917
in a star pattern with the
hee-lok on the center chair.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.750
Very good.

00:23.833 --> 00:26.417
[beeping]
Sheridan.

00:26.500 --> 00:29.083
(female #1)
'Captain, there's a problem
in the ambassadorial section.'

00:29.167 --> 00:30.875
'They're asking
for a command officer.'

00:30.958 --> 00:32.917
I'll handle it.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.833
Help is on the way.

00:37.833 --> 00:40.500
Ah, it's good to be the captain.

00:40.583 --> 00:41.833
[chuckles]

00:57.292 --> 00:58.750
san.

00:58.833 --> 01:01.333
Talia, it's been too long.

01:03.833 --> 01:06.167
And what did you think
of my NeoMars proposal?

01:06.250 --> 01:09.167
It's like all your proposals,
too progressive, too risky

01:09.250 --> 01:11.458
and too costly in the short run.

01:11.542 --> 01:13.125
But if you can make it happen..

01:13.208 --> 01:15.542
I must make it happen.

01:15.625 --> 01:18.625
FutureCorp
has to expand beyond Earth

01:18.708 --> 01:20.208
and Mars is the first step.

01:20.292 --> 01:21.750
The senate won't like it

01:21.833 --> 01:24.458
and the Mars Conglomerate
will try to bury you.

01:24.542 --> 01:26.333
We're prepared for that.

01:26.417 --> 01:29.208
Now we need to only convince
Mars to share the risk.

01:29.292 --> 01:30.375
And if they won't?

01:30.458 --> 01:31.875
Then the path to freedom

01:31.958 --> 01:34.167
may well be drenched
with innocent blood

01:34.250 --> 01:37.208
and a long-held dream of mine
will die.

01:39.083 --> 01:41.125
Mr. Isogi?

01:41.208 --> 01:44.917
Amanda Carter, Mars Colony
Business Affairs Committee.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.792
Miss Carter,
Miss Talia Winters

01:47.875 --> 01:49.667
'one of the finest
commercial telepaths'

01:49.750 --> 01:51.125
'I've ever worked with.'

01:51.208 --> 01:53.542
She will be monitoring
our negotiations

01:53.625 --> 01:54.917
for FutureCorp.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.458
(Amanda)
'Miss Winters.'

01:58.083 --> 01:59.667
Please.

01:59.750 --> 02:01.708
I read your proposal,
Mr. Isogi..

02:01.792 --> 02:04.167
[sighs]
...and frankly

02:04.250 --> 02:06.583
you're either insane
or a very brave man.

02:06.667 --> 02:08.333
I can well imagine
that's what they said

02:08.417 --> 02:11.375
of your great-grandfather John
when he volunteered to pilot

02:11.458 --> 02:13.750
the first colony ship to Mars.

02:13.833 --> 02:16.375
[chuckles]
So they did.

02:17.583 --> 02:20.167
- Let's talk.
- Please.

02:22.792 --> 02:25.833
[dramatic music]

02:30.917 --> 02:34.500
(man on TV)
We'll begin by focusing more
on the needs of our own people

02:34.583 --> 02:37.958
to move on,
to create the world that..

02:38.042 --> 02:39.250
(female #2)
13.

02:39.333 --> 02:40.792
(computer)
'All components have arrived'

02:40.875 --> 02:43.167
'safely on Babylon 5.'

02:43.250 --> 02:46.833
'Control is prepared
to go online.'

02:46.917 --> 02:49.500
Commence operation.

02:49.583 --> 02:52.625
[dramatic music]

03:16.917 --> 03:18.375
[air whooshing]

03:32.375 --> 03:37.833
(Sheridan)
The Babylon Project was
our last best hope for peace.

03:37.917 --> 03:40.750
A self-contained world,
five miles long

03:40.833 --> 03:43.208
located in neutral territory.

03:46.458 --> 03:48.458
A place of commerce
and diplomacy

03:48.542 --> 03:52.292
for a quarter of a million
humans and aliens.

03:52.375 --> 03:57.708
A shining beacon in space,
all alone in the night.

03:57.792 --> 04:01.167
It was the dawn
of the Third Age of mankind

04:01.250 --> 04:05.458
the year the Great War
came upon us all.

04:05.542 --> 04:09.458
This is the story of the last
of the Babylon stations.

04:09.542 --> 04:11.750
The year is 2259.

04:11.833 --> 04:14.833
The name of the place
is Babylon 5.

04:14.917 --> 04:17.958
[theme music]

05:01.292 --> 05:03.958
[dramatic music]

05:08.792 --> 05:10.042
(Sheridan)
'Sheridan.'

05:10.125 --> 05:11.708
(male #1)
'Captain,
you have a transmission'

05:11.792 --> 05:13.250
'from Senator Voudreau.'

05:13.333 --> 05:15.250
Patch her through.

05:15.333 --> 05:16.542
Captain Sheridan.

05:16.625 --> 05:19.750
Senator, what can I do for you?

05:19.833 --> 05:22.625
Taro Isogi,
chief executive of FutureCorp

05:22.708 --> 05:26.458
has arranged a meeting
on Babylon 5 with Amanda Carter

05:26.542 --> 05:29.208
'a representative of the Mars
Provisional Government.'

05:29.292 --> 05:33.167
Carter is an outspoken advocate
of Mars' independence

05:33.250 --> 05:36.000
and we suspect FutureCorp
is conspiring with her

05:36.083 --> 05:38.667
to finance another rebellion
on Mars colony.

05:38.750 --> 05:40.458
[chuckles]
Do you have any proof?

05:40.542 --> 05:44.583
We know FutureCorp desperately
wants a foothold in space.

05:44.667 --> 05:47.125
An exclusive trade
and services agreement with Mars

05:47.208 --> 05:48.958
would give it to them,
if they could move

05:49.042 --> 05:51.667
the current
Mars Conglomerate out.

05:51.750 --> 05:53.208
Many of the members
wanted to pull out

05:53.292 --> 05:54.542
after the last rebellion.

05:54.625 --> 05:56.917
Another would have them
running like river rats.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.083
I understand your concern

05:59.167 --> 06:01.083
but there's not much
I can do about it.

06:01.167 --> 06:04.083
I have no authority
over corporate negotiations.

06:04.167 --> 06:06.917
'Babylon 5
is neutral territory.'

06:07.000 --> 06:09.083
Any race can negotiate here

06:09.167 --> 06:11.583
without interference,
even our own.

06:11.667 --> 06:13.000
This is a possible threat

06:13.083 --> 06:15.458
to Earth Alliance security,
captain

06:15.542 --> 06:18.875
and as such, we're asking you
to check it out.

06:18.958 --> 06:20.292
'Nothing official.'

06:20.375 --> 06:22.958
Just keep an eye peeled
and an ear open

06:23.042 --> 06:25.708
and report anything
of interest to me.

06:25.792 --> 06:30.000
With all due respect, senator,
my duties as commander of B5

06:30.083 --> 06:34.042
don't include
spying on civilians.

06:34.125 --> 06:36.708
These are volatile times,
captain.

06:36.792 --> 06:39.208
Practicality is more important
than principles

06:39.292 --> 06:41.417
if lives are to be saved.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.625
'I'll expect to hear
from you soon.'

06:48.667 --> 06:50.625
[beeping]
Yes?

06:50.708 --> 06:53.333
(female #3)
'Captain, the Tikar delegation
is docking.'

06:54.708 --> 06:57.167
I'll meet them in
the conference room immediately.

06:59.125 --> 07:02.583
Mars has resources
the alien worlds need.

07:02.667 --> 07:05.667
Now they in turn
can supply an economic base

07:05.750 --> 07:08.542
which will enable the colony
to become self-sufficient

07:08.625 --> 07:10.417
within ten years.

07:10.500 --> 07:14.167
You can win your independence
without bloodshed.

07:14.250 --> 07:16.833
It will be a hard sell
with the committee.

07:16.917 --> 07:20.542
They'll need concrete assurances
from the alien worlds.

07:20.625 --> 07:22.917
Not entirely true.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.750
You're pretty sure the committee
will accept your recommendation

07:25.833 --> 07:27.833
and you're the one
who needs the assurance.

07:27.917 --> 07:30.250
Yes, I do, Miss Winters.

07:30.333 --> 07:33.083
Mars is being ripped apart
at the seams right now

07:33.167 --> 07:34.667
and before I bargain
with its future

07:34.750 --> 07:36.833
I need to know exactly
what's expected of us.

07:36.917 --> 07:39.333
Naturally.
That's one of the reasons

07:39.417 --> 07:42.917
why I suggested Babylon 5
for this meeting.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.583
All our prospective partners
have representatives here.

07:47.667 --> 07:49.458
We can iron out all the details

07:49.542 --> 07:51.292
to your government's
satisfaction.

07:51.375 --> 07:53.833
You actually believe
you can make this work?

07:53.917 --> 07:57.333
No, I believe we can try.

08:00.500 --> 08:03.833
I'll speak with the
Business Affairs Committee.

08:03.917 --> 08:06.875
I think I can have an answer
for you by tomorrow afternoon.

08:06.958 --> 08:08.875
Very good.

08:14.583 --> 08:15.792
She likes the idea.

08:15.875 --> 08:18.750
She has her doubts,
but basically she likes it.

08:18.833 --> 08:22.833
And you? Now that you've heard
the details of my little plan

08:22.917 --> 08:24.500
do you also have your doubts?

08:24.583 --> 08:25.875
Frankly, yes.

08:25.958 --> 08:27.417
The financial risk is bad enough

08:27.500 --> 08:30.500
but the legal maneuvering
will be even..

08:30.583 --> 08:33.208
I want to hear them.

08:33.292 --> 08:34.333
Over dinner?

08:34.417 --> 08:36.417
[chuckles]
I'd love to.

08:37.667 --> 08:40.292
[indistinct chatter]

08:42.167 --> 08:44.458
Hello, commander. May I?

08:44.542 --> 08:46.083
- Please.
- Hmm.

08:46.167 --> 08:49.417
- How did the conference go?
- Oh, very well, very well.

08:49.500 --> 08:51.583
Your seating arrangement
was flawless.

08:51.667 --> 08:54.625
Latir Corvo himself
complimented it.

08:54.708 --> 08:57.500
I think we'll be seeing
the Tikar on Babylon 5 soon.

08:57.583 --> 08:58.667
I'm pleased.

08:58.750 --> 09:00.292
- They're an interesting people.
- 'Yeah.'

09:00.375 --> 09:01.500
And I believe you were the one

09:01.583 --> 09:03.083
who made first contact
with them?

09:03.167 --> 09:04.333
'Yes.'

09:04.417 --> 09:07.333
The Agamemnon
was in an unexplored sector

09:07.417 --> 09:09.917
beyond the St. Andre Nebula

09:10.000 --> 09:13.708
when we cited this green cloud
floating in space.

09:13.792 --> 09:15.875
'Only it wasn't a cloud at all.'

09:15.958 --> 09:17.458
'It was a ship.'

09:17.542 --> 09:20.667
We hailed it
but got no response.

09:20.750 --> 09:24.208
We moved toward it,
it moved away.

09:24.292 --> 09:28.333
We kept that up for hours
until finally they responded.

09:28.417 --> 09:31.042
It took our linguistics division
a whole day

09:31.125 --> 09:33.458
to get even close
to deciphering their language.

09:33.542 --> 09:36.833
They'd already deciphered ours
but neglected to tell us, so..

09:36.917 --> 09:39.417
[chuckles]

09:39.500 --> 09:41.292
Oh.

09:41.375 --> 09:42.917
Oh, a Jovian Sunspot.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.875
- Ah.
- You're indulging.

09:44.958 --> 09:47.875
I earned it, and I'm off-duty.

09:47.958 --> 09:49.208
Please, continue.

09:49.292 --> 09:52.167
Well, we finally broke
the language barrier

09:52.250 --> 09:54.292
and introduced ourselves.

09:55.667 --> 09:57.833
And I was invited aboard
their ship.

09:57.917 --> 09:59.167
'Oh, it was incredible.'

09:59.250 --> 10:03.000
I'd never seen so much space
on a starship.

10:03.083 --> 10:06.625
And the Tikar themselves
are so unlike

10:06.708 --> 10:09.375
any other alien species
we'd encountered.

10:10.750 --> 10:12.667
I spent two days with them..

10:14.417 --> 10:17.000
...and what I learned
in that time made me realize

10:17.083 --> 10:20.958
just how wondrous
this galaxy of ours really is.

10:25.125 --> 10:28.417
(Talia)
I've never seen you so excited
about a deal before.

10:28.500 --> 10:30.750
Well, it's not just a deal,
Talia.

10:30.833 --> 10:32.833
It's a step into the future.

10:32.917 --> 10:36.042
Mars can be the beginning
of a whole new life

10:36.125 --> 10:39.375
for the human species
as it was meant to be.

10:41.458 --> 10:43.125
Free Mars.

10:43.208 --> 10:44.458
- Aah!
- No!

10:44.542 --> 10:47.083
[groaning]

10:48.708 --> 10:50.375
Taro!

10:50.458 --> 10:53.500
[intense music]

10:56.833 --> 10:58.458
[groans]

10:58.542 --> 11:01.583
[dramatic music]

11:04.833 --> 11:06.583
[gasps]

11:06.667 --> 11:08.417
Taro.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.292
[sobs]
Taro.

11:12.208 --> 11:13.208
Taro.

11:13.292 --> 11:15.000
(Sheridan)
So you have no idea

11:15.083 --> 11:17.583
what the images you got
from the killer meant?

11:19.000 --> 11:20.917
No, it was all too quick.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.208
Just a, a blur of light
and sound

11:24.292 --> 11:25.417
and then the blackness.

11:25.500 --> 11:27.583
And all he said was,
"Free Mars?"

11:27.667 --> 11:30.750
Yes, but...my first assignment
was Mars Colony.

11:30.833 --> 11:34.583
I scanned several Free Mars
people during that time.

11:34.667 --> 11:36.667
They're violent fanatics
with a murderous hatred

11:36.750 --> 11:39.375
of Earth Alliance,
but this man was different.

11:39.458 --> 11:41.375
There was no thought
of a cause in his head.

11:41.458 --> 11:45.083
No anger,
no, no emotion of any kind.

11:45.167 --> 11:46.500
Just those images.

11:46.583 --> 11:48.500
So what reason
would Free Mars have

11:48.583 --> 11:50.417
for killing your client?

11:50.500 --> 11:51.667
None.

11:51.750 --> 11:53.875
Taro's proposal
was a peaceful solution

11:53.958 --> 11:55.292
to the Mars problem.

11:55.375 --> 11:57.833
Well, Earth Central
feels differently.

11:57.917 --> 12:01.542
They believe he was going to
back another rebellion on Mars.

12:01.625 --> 12:03.167
[quavers]
Taro hated the violence on Mars.

12:03.250 --> 12:05.625
He never would have done
such a thing.

12:05.708 --> 12:07.292
Someone's been lying to you,
captain.

12:07.375 --> 12:09.208
- Or to you.
- I'm a telepath.

12:09.292 --> 12:10.500
'Telepaths are human beings.'

12:10.583 --> 12:12.583
You were an old friend
of Isogi's.

12:12.667 --> 12:14.458
- You trusted him.
- With good reason.

12:14.542 --> 12:17.542
Taro Isogi spent his life
improving the lives of others.

12:17.625 --> 12:19.458
He built a business
based on that principle

12:19.542 --> 12:22.417
and he never broke a rule
and harmed another to do it.

12:25.167 --> 12:26.542
[sniffles]

12:26.625 --> 12:29.167
Mars was his dream, captain.

12:29.250 --> 12:30.583
Now he's been murdered for it

12:30.667 --> 12:33.458
and you're trying to cast
the blame on him.

12:34.792 --> 12:36.958
[sighs]
I'm sorry.

12:37.042 --> 12:38.750
I'm sorry too.

12:41.458 --> 12:42.833
I'm also tired, and I hurt.

12:42.917 --> 12:45.000
May I go back
to my quarters now?

12:45.083 --> 12:47.458
Yes, I'll arrange for an escort.

12:47.542 --> 12:49.542
One escort at your service.

12:50.792 --> 12:52.542
[sighs]

12:57.458 --> 13:01.042
- This really isn't necessary.
- Captain's orders.

13:01.125 --> 13:03.833
Now he's worried about you,
and so am I.

13:05.292 --> 13:06.417
Besides, this gives us a chance

13:06.500 --> 13:08.167
to get to know
each other better.

13:08.250 --> 13:09.958
I've led a fascinating life.

13:10.042 --> 13:13.625
[quavers]
Mr. Garibaldi, Taro Isogi
was like a father to me.

13:13.708 --> 13:17.583
I loved him as a client
and as a mentor and as a friend

13:17.667 --> 13:20.375
and now he's dead.

13:20.458 --> 13:21.917
You'll forgive me
if I'm not in the mood

13:22.000 --> 13:23.917
for your usual badinage.

13:25.792 --> 13:27.750
You're right, um..

13:27.833 --> 13:30.417
It's a bad time for you,
I'm being a yutz.

13:32.292 --> 13:34.833
Apology accepted.

13:34.917 --> 13:37.667
Could you at least tell me
what badinage means?

13:38.917 --> 13:41.375
[laughs]

13:43.958 --> 13:46.375
Well, my pop always said that
laughter's better than pills

13:46.458 --> 13:48.083
for what ails you.

13:49.500 --> 13:51.208
He was right.

13:54.917 --> 13:57.167
We'll get the creep
who did this, I promise.

13:57.250 --> 14:01.000
That won't bring Taro back
or his dreams for Mars Colony.

14:01.083 --> 14:03.750
No, but it will save someone
else from getting killed.

14:05.083 --> 14:08.125
[indistinct chatter]

14:15.167 --> 14:18.208
[dramatic music]

14:25.750 --> 14:26.917
(computer)
'Command?'

14:27.000 --> 14:30.542
Code, alpha-six-six-zeta-three.

14:30.625 --> 14:33.417
(computer)
'Unable to respond.'

14:33.500 --> 14:35.583
'Code not recogni..'

14:35.667 --> 14:36.958
'Code acknowledged. Report.'

14:37.042 --> 14:38.875
Phase I complete.

14:38.958 --> 14:43.000
'Download all mission data,
then erase source file.'

14:57.292 --> 14:58.375
[groans]

14:58.458 --> 14:59.958
(Talia)
'Taro!'

15:00.042 --> 15:02.208
[groaning]

15:02.292 --> 15:04.292
(computer)
'Witness ID, Talia Winters.'

15:04.375 --> 15:06.208
'Resident commercial telepath.'

15:06.292 --> 15:08.000
'Rating, P-5.'

15:08.083 --> 15:10.042
'Standby.'

15:10.125 --> 15:12.833
'Control states Miss Winters
could jeopardize mission.'

15:12.917 --> 15:16.125
'Eliminate her,
then continue with Phase II.'

15:16.208 --> 15:17.917
Understood.

15:19.292 --> 15:21.833
Search mode.

15:21.917 --> 15:24.208
Location of Talia Winters.

15:29.167 --> 15:32.167
I want you to hold all outgoing
traffic until further notice.

15:33.792 --> 15:35.125
There's been a murder,
and I don't want

15:35.208 --> 15:36.417
the killer jumping station.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.167
- Do you know who it is?
- Not yet.

15:38.250 --> 15:40.833
But we do have an eyewitness,
Talia Winters.

15:40.917 --> 15:43.167
- Was she hurt?
- 'Fortunately not.'

15:43.250 --> 15:46.333
I think
the killer wanted a witness.

15:46.417 --> 15:48.375
Tell me,
what do you think of her?

15:48.458 --> 15:50.958
- Miss Winters?
- 'Hmm.'

15:51.042 --> 15:54.250
I think
she's an interesting person.

15:54.333 --> 15:56.583
You never describe anybody
that way.

15:56.667 --> 15:58.042
I mean, I don't
really know her that well.

15:58.125 --> 16:00.083
I mean,
we've chatted from time to time

16:00.167 --> 16:02.500
and she's...interesting.

16:03.625 --> 16:05.167
But you know how I feel
about telepaths.

16:05.250 --> 16:08.208
[scoffs]
Do I ever.

16:08.292 --> 16:10.583
You threw one out
of a third story window on Io.

16:10.667 --> 16:12.333
There was an ample pool
below the window.

16:12.417 --> 16:14.667
I'll assume you knew that.

16:14.750 --> 16:17.792
Aside from Miss Winters'
interesting quality

16:17.875 --> 16:19.875
do you think she can be trusted?

16:21.583 --> 16:23.042
Yes, except..

16:25.750 --> 16:27.667
...she's very loyal
to Psi Corps.

16:27.750 --> 16:30.208
Hmm. And you don't trust
Psi Corps?

16:30.292 --> 16:32.292
No. Do you?

16:37.125 --> 16:39.667
Telepaths are gifted and cursed

16:39.750 --> 16:43.000
in ways I can never hope
to understand.

16:43.083 --> 16:46.167
But they're still human beings,
good, bad, or indifferent.

16:48.375 --> 16:49.917
No.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.750
I trust in individuals,
not organizations.

16:52.833 --> 16:55.125
Then you may trust Miss Winters.

17:09.833 --> 17:12.083
[doorbell beeping]

17:12.167 --> 17:14.083
Come in.

17:14.167 --> 17:17.000
Miss Carter.
I'm Captain John Sheridan

17:17.083 --> 17:19.208
commander of Babylon 5.

17:19.292 --> 17:21.250
I'd like to ask you
a few questions

17:21.333 --> 17:23.708
about your meeting
with Taro Isogi.

17:23.792 --> 17:25.250
[scoffs]

17:25.333 --> 17:28.750
I'm afraid I must decline,
captain.

17:28.833 --> 17:31.792
Private negotiations are not
subject to Earth for scrutiny.

17:31.875 --> 17:34.500
In this case, they are.

17:34.583 --> 17:36.250
Mr. Isogi was murdered
last night.

17:36.333 --> 17:38.333
What? Who could have--

17:38.417 --> 17:42.625
According to an eyewitness,
the killer said, "Free Mars."

17:42.708 --> 17:45.625
- Free Mars?
- 'Yes.'

17:45.708 --> 17:47.375
No, that can't be.

17:47.458 --> 17:50.625
There's no way they could have
known about this meeting.

17:50.708 --> 17:53.042
And even if they did,
they had nothing to gain

17:53.125 --> 17:54.958
by killing Mr. Isogi.

17:55.042 --> 17:57.792
'Taro was working to achieve
a peaceful compromise'

17:57.875 --> 18:00.542
that would ensure
the colony's independence

18:00.625 --> 18:02.667
without bloodshed.

18:02.750 --> 18:05.333
Somebody
obviously didn't like it.

18:05.417 --> 18:07.542
Damn them.

18:07.625 --> 18:10.542
Any idea who they might be?

18:10.625 --> 18:12.833
The senate.
Mars Conglomerate.

18:14.083 --> 18:16.625
They'd be the most opposed.

18:16.708 --> 18:18.625
I never thought
they'd go this far.

18:18.708 --> 18:20.250
Thank you for your time,
Miss Carter.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.667
I may have some additional
questions for you later.

18:22.750 --> 18:25.167
I'll be glad to help.

18:25.250 --> 18:26.667
Whoever killed Taro Isogi

18:26.750 --> 18:29.708
killed Mars' best hope
for the future.

18:29.792 --> 18:32.833
[dramatic music]

18:39.500 --> 18:41.583
[sighs]

18:47.250 --> 18:50.417
[sighs]
What have you come up with?

18:50.500 --> 18:52.000
Forensics said
Isogi's body was hit

18:52.083 --> 18:53.875
with a massive
electrical charge.

18:53.958 --> 18:56.375
Disrupted every cell
in his body.

18:56.458 --> 18:58.083
There are scorch marks
on his throat

18:58.167 --> 18:59.500
that show the outline
of fingers

18:59.583 --> 19:01.750
but no prints or striations
of any kind.

19:01.833 --> 19:04.708
- A slaver's glove?
- Nah.

19:04.792 --> 19:06.125
I mean, they pack a jolt,
but not enough

19:06.208 --> 19:08.125
to do this much damage.

19:08.208 --> 19:09.792
This is high-tech,
and definitely

19:09.875 --> 19:12.292
not standard Free Mars issue.

19:12.375 --> 19:15.875
My guess is some sort
of prosthetic weaponry.

19:15.958 --> 19:19.417
What I can't figure is how
he got it on the station.

19:19.500 --> 19:21.875
A power source that would
generate that big a charge

19:21.958 --> 19:23.875
should show up on scanners.

19:23.958 --> 19:27.375
Maybe he had some special help.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.417
You want to explain that?

19:29.500 --> 19:32.083
Not till we have more to go on.

19:32.167 --> 19:36.000
Keep an escort on Miss Winters
and intensify the search.

19:36.083 --> 19:38.750
Include EarthGov
and Corp secure areas.

19:38.833 --> 19:40.958
Will do. Captain..

19:43.500 --> 19:45.667
...I'd sure like to know
where you're going with this.

19:45.750 --> 19:47.542
Someplace very dark.

19:48.750 --> 19:50.917
And I hope to God I'm wrong.

20:01.917 --> 20:03.833
(male #2)
Hey, Earther!

20:03.917 --> 20:06.750
[intense music]

20:06.833 --> 20:08.833
[screams]

20:10.958 --> 20:13.208
[grunting]

20:15.208 --> 20:16.833
Free Mars.

20:24.167 --> 20:25.792
Ah, no.

20:29.750 --> 20:32.500
[gasps]
Help!

20:32.583 --> 20:35.417
'Help me, somebody!'

20:35.500 --> 20:38.292
What have they done to me?

20:38.375 --> 20:41.375
[groaning]

21:04.583 --> 21:07.083
(Talia)
'The images in his mind
were the same as before'

21:07.167 --> 21:09.958
except this time
I saw an Earth Alliance ship.

21:10.042 --> 21:12.667
A big one.
Um, a cruiser, I think.

21:12.750 --> 21:14.208
It was firing at him.

21:14.292 --> 21:16.375
And I know this sounds crazy,
but it hit him.

21:16.458 --> 21:18.542
- And he died.
- Died?

21:18.625 --> 21:20.667
It was as if
he were reliving the thought

21:20.750 --> 21:22.500
of his death over and over again

21:22.583 --> 21:25.583
clinging to it, as if it were
the only thought he had.

21:25.667 --> 21:27.917
Captain,
we got an ID on our perp.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.667
I checked the DNA in the hair

21:29.750 --> 21:31.167
that Miss Winters
pulled out of his head.

21:31.250 --> 21:34.042
- It's positive. Take a look.
- That's him.

21:34.125 --> 21:36.292
(Garibaldi)
Yeah, he's Free Mars, alright.
One of their leaders, in fact.

21:36.375 --> 21:38.583
- Name's Abel Horn.
- Abel Horn?

21:38.667 --> 21:40.875
- You know him?
- 'In a way.'

21:40.958 --> 21:43.625
My wife Anna and I had some
very special friends on Mars.

21:43.708 --> 21:45.542
They worked at Ritchey Station.

21:45.625 --> 21:48.708
They were there
when Free Mars blew it.

21:48.792 --> 21:51.458
Abel Horn
claimed responsibility for it.

21:54.042 --> 21:56.333
I want him, Mr. Garibaldi.

21:56.417 --> 21:58.417
So do I,
but there's a, a problem.

21:58.500 --> 22:01.083
According to Earthforce
Intelligence, Abel Horn is dead.

22:01.167 --> 22:02.500
'A cruiser scragged his ship'

22:02.583 --> 22:04.375
'over Phobos
during the rebellion.'

22:04.458 --> 22:06.083
Oh, my God.

22:06.167 --> 22:08.542
Is that what you saw
in his mind?

22:08.625 --> 22:10.042
Yes.

22:10.125 --> 22:12.542
Would someone tell me what
the hell we're talking about?

22:12.625 --> 22:13.875
'Sir?'

22:15.833 --> 22:17.292
Later.

22:17.375 --> 22:19.417
Right now, I want her
in protective custody

22:19.500 --> 22:21.250
and a fugitive alert
posted on Horn.

22:21.333 --> 22:23.125
Done. Miss Winters?

22:23.208 --> 22:26.250
[dramatic music]

22:38.875 --> 22:40.292
Amanda.

22:43.333 --> 22:45.292
It's been a long time.

22:48.792 --> 22:51.542
- I thought you were dead.
- Damn near.

22:51.625 --> 22:54.375
Earthers blew me up
over Phobos.

22:54.458 --> 22:57.125
Your old buddy Singer found me,
got me out.

22:57.208 --> 22:59.417
A snakehead doc fixed me up.

22:59.500 --> 23:02.750
I've been hiding
in the Tigris Sector ever since.

23:02.833 --> 23:05.792
'Then I got word
you were coming here.'

23:05.875 --> 23:08.667
- Why did you kill Taro Isogi?
- Who?

23:08.750 --> 23:11.125
'The man I came here to meet.
They say you killed him.'

23:11.208 --> 23:13.292
There's a fugitive alert
out for you.

23:13.375 --> 23:16.875
They're lying.
I haven't killed anyone.

23:16.958 --> 23:18.958
I came here to see you.

23:19.042 --> 23:20.125
I have to get back to Mars

23:20.208 --> 23:23.292
and you're the only one
who can help me.

23:23.375 --> 23:25.458
I can't do that, Abel.

23:25.542 --> 23:29.458
I am finally in a position
to help with Mars' independence.

23:29.542 --> 23:32.167
I-if anyone found out I was once
a member of Free Mars--

23:32.250 --> 23:35.750
Which just might come out,
if they were to catch me here.

23:35.833 --> 23:40.333
[scoffs]
You came here to blackmail me
into smuggling you back to Mars?

23:41.625 --> 23:44.167
That was never your style, Abel.

23:47.833 --> 23:49.625
I've changed.

23:49.708 --> 23:52.458
[dramatic music]

23:54.125 --> 23:56.667
[groaning]

23:56.750 --> 23:58.167
Abel, what's wrong?

23:58.250 --> 24:00.458
[groaning]

24:00.542 --> 24:02.292
Abel!

24:02.375 --> 24:06.125
Amanda, please,
you have to help me.

24:06.208 --> 24:08.250
Help me!

24:08.333 --> 24:11.875
They did something to-to-to me.

24:11.958 --> 24:14.542
The tel-telepath knows.

24:14.625 --> 24:17.250
Talia Winters. Aah!

24:17.333 --> 24:18.583
Abel!

24:18.667 --> 24:21.875
[groans]
Saw it in my head.

24:21.958 --> 24:24.875
Have to, have to,
have to find her.

24:24.958 --> 24:26.875
[groaning]

24:26.958 --> 24:29.375
Los-los-los-losing control.

24:29.458 --> 24:31.042
Stop! Stop!

24:31.125 --> 24:33.375
There's only one way in here
and I have a full detail on it.

24:33.458 --> 24:34.833
It would take an army
to get to you.

24:34.917 --> 24:36.583
If you need to go somewhere,
call the guard post

24:36.667 --> 24:39.458
and they'll assign an escort.

24:39.542 --> 24:40.875
Try to relax.

24:40.958 --> 24:44.042
[chuckles]
Enjoy yourself.
We'll take care of this guy.

24:44.125 --> 24:47.542
[sighs]
Mr. Garibaldi,
I was just going to make

24:47.625 --> 24:50.042
a cup of tea
to soothe my nerves.

24:50.125 --> 24:52.625
Would you like one?

24:52.708 --> 24:55.000
Well, since I am
chief of security

24:55.083 --> 24:57.333
I guess seeing your secure
is my job

24:57.417 --> 24:59.958
and tea just happens to be
my third favorite thing

25:00.042 --> 25:02.167
in the universe.

25:02.250 --> 25:04.167
- I needed this yesterday.
- I mean, she's right.

25:05.667 --> 25:07.333
Commander,
the captain of the Matheson

25:07.417 --> 25:08.833
is demanding an update
on his departure.

25:08.917 --> 25:10.792
Tell him to go away,
tell them all to go away.

25:10.875 --> 25:12.083
How's it going?

25:12.167 --> 25:14.083
We've had twenty complaints,
six formal protests

25:14.167 --> 25:16.417
and one outright threat,
all in the last hour.

25:16.500 --> 25:18.083
The natives are very restless.

25:18.167 --> 25:21.042
- Start moving them out.
- What about the murderer?

25:21.125 --> 25:23.292
I don't think
he's trying to leave yet

25:23.375 --> 25:25.667
but have every ship searched.

25:25.750 --> 25:28.333
I'll be in my quarters. There's
something I wanna check out.

25:31.667 --> 25:34.750
So then my pop says to the guy,
"50 credits for a salami?

25:34.833 --> 25:36.333
I could have killed you for 20."

25:36.417 --> 25:37.917
[laughing]

25:38.000 --> 25:39.750
Your father
was quite a character.

25:39.833 --> 25:41.292
He was the best.

25:41.375 --> 25:43.000
He cooked like an angel,
swore like the devil

25:43.083 --> 25:45.500
and taught me everything
I know about security.

25:45.583 --> 25:47.292
The old man could spot
a crook a sector away

25:47.375 --> 25:50.667
and he was still hauling them
in at 75.

25:50.750 --> 25:53.333
'Then he got
Torg's Syndrome and..'

25:53.417 --> 25:55.875
...just kind of faded away.

25:55.958 --> 25:57.667
I sure miss him.

25:57.750 --> 26:01.125
I never really knew my father
or my mother.

26:01.208 --> 26:04.417
I was raised by Psi Corps
from the time I was five.

26:04.500 --> 26:06.792
- Of course, there was Abby.
- Abby?

26:06.875 --> 26:10.125
She was my support during
my first year at the center.

26:10.208 --> 26:12.292
When telepaths first come,
they're assigned

26:12.375 --> 26:13.792
a senior telepath to guide them

26:13.875 --> 26:16.625
through the early stages
of the program.

26:16.708 --> 26:19.875
The first day,
I was crying all the time.

26:19.958 --> 26:23.458
I was scared and confused
and hurting

26:23.542 --> 26:25.542
and then Abby came.

26:25.625 --> 26:28.000
She held me
for a very long time

26:28.083 --> 26:30.167
never saying a word.

26:30.250 --> 26:32.833
I didn't know it then,
but she was scanning me

26:32.917 --> 26:35.000
ever so gently.

26:35.083 --> 26:37.250
And little by little,
the pain and fear

26:37.333 --> 26:40.500
and confusion melted,
and all that was left

26:40.583 --> 26:43.417
was this warm, safe place
in my mind.

26:44.583 --> 26:47.458
It was wonderful.

26:47.542 --> 26:50.375
But the next year, Abby was
assigned to another newcomer.

26:50.458 --> 26:53.750
[beeps]
Garibaldi.

26:53.833 --> 26:57.167
(Sheridan)
'Mr. Garibaldi,
please report to my quarters.'

26:57.250 --> 26:58.833
On my way.

27:00.208 --> 27:01.708
Sorry.

27:07.500 --> 27:09.208
Mr. Garibaldi..

27:10.792 --> 27:13.042
...thank you.

27:13.125 --> 27:15.125
My pleasure, Miss Winters.

27:23.542 --> 27:25.417
[doorbell beeps]
Come.

27:26.958 --> 27:30.083
Mr. Garibaldi,
take a look at this.

27:30.167 --> 27:32.417
(Garibaldi)
'"Project Lazarus."
Never heard of it.'

27:32.500 --> 27:34.750
It was part of Earthforce's
cyber experiments

27:34.833 --> 27:36.250
back in the late '30s.

27:36.333 --> 27:38.333
Most of the cyber experiments
were a bust.

27:38.417 --> 27:40.542
I mean, humans couldn't function
with machines in their brains.

27:40.625 --> 27:42.875
Correct. That's why
they came up with the idea

27:42.958 --> 27:45.250
of using subjects
on the verge of death.

27:45.333 --> 27:47.125
Accident victims, uh

27:47.208 --> 27:49.042
wounded soldiers,
people in comas.

27:49.125 --> 27:51.458
You're kidding?
That's grotesque.

27:51.542 --> 27:54.292
[scoffs]
Gets even better.

27:54.375 --> 27:57.417
The theory was to hardwire
the subject's brain

27:57.500 --> 27:59.417
with a computer intelligence.

27:59.500 --> 28:03.417
It kept the brain functional
while the body was repaired.

28:03.500 --> 28:05.750
Then using telepathic deep scan

28:05.833 --> 28:08.708
the subject was fixated
on the moment of his death

28:08.792 --> 28:11.417
shutting down
all conscious thought.

28:11.500 --> 28:13.500
The computer
takes complete control

28:13.583 --> 28:16.042
while the subject is dying
over and over again

28:16.125 --> 28:17.917
in his subconscious.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.708
Miss Winters said
that Horn was clinging

28:21.792 --> 28:23.375
to the thought of his death

28:23.458 --> 28:26.375
as if it were
the only thought he had.

28:26.458 --> 28:28.167
Whoa, hold on. Are you sayin'

28:28.250 --> 28:30.000
Horn is one of these
cyber zombies?

28:30.083 --> 28:31.167
'I'm saying he might be.'

28:31.250 --> 28:32.292
His body could have been

28:32.375 --> 28:33.500
recovered after the blast.

28:33.583 --> 28:35.208
Or Intelligence was wrong again

28:35.292 --> 28:37.667
and Horn was never in the ship
that was blasted.

28:37.750 --> 28:40.125
Well, that's
the simple explanation

28:40.208 --> 28:44.208
and ordinarily I'd accept it,
but this isn't a simple thing.

28:44.292 --> 28:46.125
'A known Free Mars terrorist'

28:46.208 --> 28:48.292
kills a man
in front of a witness

28:48.375 --> 28:49.750
and leaves her alive.

28:49.833 --> 28:52.958
Later he kills another man
to get to that witness

28:53.042 --> 28:55.125
and again leaves her alive.

28:55.208 --> 28:56.958
Why?

28:57.042 --> 28:59.250
Maybe he's squeamish
about killing women.

28:59.333 --> 29:02.208
Or maybe Talia Winters
touched something in him.

29:02.292 --> 29:06.583
Something that made Horn realize
who he really was for a moment.

29:06.667 --> 29:09.000
I think it's playing havoc
with his programming.

29:09.083 --> 29:10.958
You almost have me believing
this load.

29:11.042 --> 29:13.542
I'm not sure I believe it myself

29:13.625 --> 29:17.208
but if it's true, there should
be a way to locate him.

29:18.667 --> 29:21.708
[dramatic music]

29:31.083 --> 29:33.250
(computer)
'Command.'

29:33.333 --> 29:36.750
I'd like to make a transmission
to Miss Talia Winters.

29:36.833 --> 29:38.417
'Working.'

29:46.417 --> 29:48.625
- So you'll meet with me?
- Yes.

29:48.708 --> 29:51.458
- In a half hour?
- I'll look forward to it.

29:54.542 --> 29:56.208
[groans]

29:56.292 --> 29:59.333
- Amanda, I knew you'd help me.
- Abel, all I did was..

29:59.417 --> 30:01.542
[grunts]

30:05.625 --> 30:07.667
(Sheridan)
'Well, this is a long shot.'

30:07.750 --> 30:10.875
My information on Lazarus
is 20 years old

30:10.958 --> 30:13.500
but according to the files

30:13.583 --> 30:15.125
the computer power crystal emits

30:15.208 --> 30:17.917
a low level
of a benign radiation.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.750
It wouldn't ordinarily show up
on the environmental scanners

30:21.833 --> 30:24.708
but if we could reconfigure them
to look for it.

30:24.792 --> 30:26.667
[beeping]
Garibaldi.

30:26.750 --> 30:28.542
(Zack)
'Chief, Zack Allan.'

30:28.625 --> 30:30.250
'Miss Winters
is requesting an escort'

30:30.333 --> 30:32.208
'for a business meeting
in Red 7.'

30:32.292 --> 30:34.667
- With who?
- 'Amanda Carter.'

30:36.000 --> 30:37.417
That's a go, Zack.

30:37.500 --> 30:40.750
Come through Red Alpha.
I'll join you at Point 6.

30:40.833 --> 30:44.250
Hmm. This is trickier
than I thought.

30:44.333 --> 30:47.083
The element
is definitely out-of-date.

30:47.167 --> 30:49.500
Why not let the wizard
have a go?

30:54.667 --> 30:56.917
Now..

30:57.000 --> 30:59.167
...all we have to do

30:59.250 --> 31:02.208
is cross-reference
with the Medlab files

31:02.292 --> 31:04.750
find the updated element number

31:04.833 --> 31:08.958
log that with E-systems,
and voila.

31:16.333 --> 31:18.542
It's trickier than you thought.

31:25.875 --> 31:28.750
Thanks...Mr. Wizard.

31:32.792 --> 31:34.625
Miss Winters,
it's not a good idea

31:34.708 --> 31:36.167
to be roaming
around the station.

31:36.250 --> 31:38.542
I'm hardly roaming.

31:38.625 --> 31:41.375
No, I guess not.
So what's up?

31:41.458 --> 31:43.958
Amanda Carter wants to pursue
Taro's plan.

31:44.042 --> 31:46.625
I don't know if I can convince
FutureCorp to go along

31:46.708 --> 31:50.042
but if I could, it would be
like a memorial for Taro.

31:50.125 --> 31:52.583
Now they can kill a good man,
but not a good idea.

31:54.333 --> 31:56.625
Take your time.
We'll be right here.

31:59.667 --> 32:01.083
Hello?

32:01.167 --> 32:03.750
[dramatic music]

32:03.833 --> 32:05.083
Hello?

32:09.542 --> 32:11.750
Miss Carter.

32:11.833 --> 32:13.375
Miss Carter?

32:14.917 --> 32:17.292
Make one sound
and I'll kill you.

32:21.917 --> 32:24.000
That should do it.

32:24.083 --> 32:25.875
Computer, begin scan.

32:25.958 --> 32:27.875
(computer)
'Commencing.'

32:30.917 --> 32:33.125
What am I? Tell me!

32:33.208 --> 32:36.000
- I don't understand.
- You're a mind bender.

32:36.083 --> 32:38.708
You saw it in my head.

32:38.792 --> 32:41.292
Tell me what it means!
Tell me!

32:41.375 --> 32:43.208
[gasps]

32:43.292 --> 32:44.958
Pain. Pain.

32:45.042 --> 32:46.583
Yes, pain!

32:51.458 --> 32:53.625
Tell me. Tell me, please.

32:53.708 --> 32:55.625
- Ah.
- 'Please?'

32:55.708 --> 32:58.750
[intense music]

33:12.000 --> 33:14.083
Ours now.

33:14.167 --> 33:16.125
All ours.

33:20.042 --> 33:22.542
(Talia)
You were dying.

33:22.625 --> 33:26.583
They operated on you,
rebuilt you.

33:26.667 --> 33:28.625
Scanned you.

33:28.708 --> 33:30.250
There was a Psi cop.

33:30.333 --> 33:31.833
(computer)
'Scan complete.'

33:31.917 --> 33:35.292
'Low-level ironium radiation
detected.'

33:35.375 --> 33:38.500
'Red 7, Suite 15.'

33:39.833 --> 33:42.167
Suite 15?

33:42.250 --> 33:43.792
Amanda Carter.

33:43.875 --> 33:46.167
- Garibaldi.
- 'Captain.'

33:46.250 --> 33:47.333
Where is Miss Winters?

33:47.417 --> 33:49.208
Meeting with Miss Carter
in her quarters.

33:49.292 --> 33:51.917
(Sheridan)
'Our perp's inside.
Get him, but get him alive.'

33:52.000 --> 33:53.708
I'm on my way.

33:53.792 --> 33:54.833
Damn it! Our perp's inside.

33:54.917 --> 33:56.333
Jackson, left side,
Hanson, right.

33:56.417 --> 33:58.458
Watch out for Talia. Remember,
this guy kills by touch.

33:58.542 --> 34:00.500
Zack, let's get the door.

34:03.417 --> 34:05.333
Ready?

34:05.417 --> 34:06.583
Go!

34:06.667 --> 34:07.958
Freeze!

34:08.042 --> 34:10.042
I'll fry her. I swear it.

34:10.125 --> 34:13.458
End of the road, pal.
There's nowhere to go.

34:13.542 --> 34:16.333
- Come on, think about it.
- Can't think.

34:16.417 --> 34:18.125
[groans]

34:18.208 --> 34:21.458
- When I think--
- Okay, okay.

34:21.542 --> 34:24.875
- Take it easy.
- Drop the guns.

34:24.958 --> 34:27.042
Back off. Do it!

34:27.125 --> 34:28.625
Do it.

34:41.083 --> 34:43.875
You hurt that lady, and I'll see
it takes you ten days to die.

34:43.958 --> 34:45.625
[laughs]

34:45.708 --> 34:48.083
I'm already dead,
Mr. Security man.

34:48.167 --> 34:49.708
No, you aren't, Horn.

34:49.792 --> 34:51.125
'Now just listen to me.'

34:51.208 --> 34:53.958
They are using you
to betray your own world.

34:54.042 --> 34:57.125
- How do you know this?
- 'You know it, too, Abel.'

34:57.208 --> 35:00.000
You can feel the machine
crawling in your brain.

35:01.417 --> 35:03.667
Get out of my way!

35:03.750 --> 35:06.167
(Sheridan)
'Let us help you.
That's all we wanna do.'

35:06.250 --> 35:09.042
You let her go,
and we'll help you.

35:10.792 --> 35:12.833
You've died too many times,
Abel.

35:12.917 --> 35:15.083
There's no need to die again.

35:19.542 --> 35:20.958
Good.

35:21.042 --> 35:24.458
Now put the weapon down.

35:24.542 --> 35:27.000
It was the Earthers, wasn't it?

35:27.083 --> 35:29.958
It wasn't, wasn't enough
just to kill me.

35:30.042 --> 35:32.167
(Sheridan)
'We'll find out
who it was together.'

35:32.250 --> 35:34.917
Just put the gun down.

35:39.458 --> 35:41.708
Mars will never be free

35:41.792 --> 35:45.167
until the sands run red
with Earther blood.

35:46.292 --> 35:47.208
[rizz]

35:47.292 --> 35:49.583
[groaning]

35:56.042 --> 35:58.750
Thanks for ending it, Earther.

36:01.042 --> 36:03.083
[groaning]

36:05.083 --> 36:06.583
Damn it!

36:06.667 --> 36:09.125
[whirring]

36:09.208 --> 36:11.000
Captain, I'm reading
a dangerous energy surge

36:11.083 --> 36:12.417
from the body.

36:12.500 --> 36:13.583
Get her out of here.

36:13.667 --> 36:15.750
Come on, everybody out,
everybody out.

36:15.833 --> 36:17.125
'Come on! Go! Now!'

36:17.208 --> 36:20.250
[intense music]

36:28.792 --> 36:29.958
[explosion]

36:30.042 --> 36:31.958
[grunts]

36:39.917 --> 36:41.625
No trace.

36:41.708 --> 36:43.458
No evidence.

36:58.833 --> 37:01.208
I am very sorry, Miss Winters.

37:02.375 --> 37:04.083
Abel said you knew
what was wrong with him.

37:04.167 --> 37:07.208
I was worried about him. I..

37:07.292 --> 37:08.750
I never thought
he would try to harm you.

37:08.833 --> 37:10.750
And how does
a Mars government rep

37:10.833 --> 37:13.750
know so much
about a Free Mars terrorist?

37:17.417 --> 37:20.458
Abel Horn
wasn't always a terrorist.

37:20.542 --> 37:24.792
Fifteen years ago,
he was a bright young man

37:24.875 --> 37:28.875
utterly devoted
to independence for Mars Colony.

37:28.958 --> 37:31.625
That's when I met him..

37:31.708 --> 37:33.833
...and fell in love with him.

37:33.917 --> 37:36.125
He convinced me
to join Free Mars.

37:36.208 --> 37:39.292
It wasn't a radical group
at the time.

37:39.375 --> 37:42.917
Later, when they began
to become violent, I left them.

37:45.750 --> 37:47.833
I never saw Abel again
until today.

37:47.917 --> 37:49.583
Oh, tell me another one.

37:49.667 --> 37:51.167
You could have
Miss Winters scan me

37:51.250 --> 37:52.917
if you think I'm lying.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.500
Besides, I've already said
enough to ruin my career.

37:55.583 --> 37:57.833
If we report it.

37:57.917 --> 37:59.667
Are you proposing a deal,
captain?

37:59.750 --> 38:03.583
You said Taro Isogi's plan
was the best hope for Mars.

38:03.667 --> 38:05.917
- 'Did you mean that?'
- Yes.

38:06.000 --> 38:09.042
Then continue to negotiate
with FutureCorp.

38:09.125 --> 38:10.833
Make that happen.

38:12.875 --> 38:15.708
I doubt they'd be interested
after what happened here.

38:15.792 --> 38:17.708
I'll be glad to speak to them
for you.

38:17.792 --> 38:19.917
I'll make it clear
that your government had nothing

38:20.000 --> 38:21.333
to do with the murder.

38:21.417 --> 38:23.667
I'm sure they'll consider
going ahead.

38:26.292 --> 38:27.458
Why?

38:27.542 --> 38:30.250
To make sure Taro Isogi's dream
becomes a reality

38:30.333 --> 38:33.542
and to keep you
where you can do the most good.

38:33.625 --> 38:35.750
Thank you.

38:35.833 --> 38:37.708
We'll talk later.

38:45.292 --> 38:49.042
Captain, begging your pardon,
but have you gone space happy?

38:49.125 --> 38:51.625
That woman is an accessory
to murder and attempted murder.

38:51.708 --> 38:53.875
Horn wasn't trying to kill me.

38:53.958 --> 38:55.417
He wanted me to scan him.

38:55.500 --> 38:58.625
There was something in his mind
controlling him.

38:58.708 --> 39:00.500
Something he wanted me to find.

39:00.583 --> 39:02.167
And did you?

39:04.333 --> 39:07.375
I saw an image,
some sort of an operation.

39:07.458 --> 39:08.917
Well,
did you recognize anything?

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
A location, a face, uniform?

39:14.250 --> 39:15.583
No.

39:17.583 --> 39:19.083
Take Miss Winters
to her quarters.

39:19.167 --> 39:21.750
I'll help Ivanova
move the traffic out.

39:35.708 --> 39:37.667
Captain.

39:37.750 --> 39:40.375
Mr. Garibaldi.

39:40.458 --> 39:42.958
- Is there something?
- There's a whole list.

39:43.042 --> 39:44.125
But let's start
with how you knew about

39:44.208 --> 39:46.292
the Lazarus Project.

39:46.375 --> 39:50.042
Some people
collect coins or art.

39:51.708 --> 39:53.333
I collect secrets.

39:53.417 --> 39:55.625
Black projects, conspiracies

39:55.708 --> 39:58.083
secret organizations, uh..

39:58.167 --> 40:00.083
...they fascinate me.

40:01.583 --> 40:02.792
Does one of those secrets
include

40:02.875 --> 40:04.958
who was behind this thing?

40:09.500 --> 40:10.792
It's better you don't ask that.

40:10.875 --> 40:12.375
'Look, captain, uh, I know'

40:12.458 --> 40:13.792
you don't trust me
the way Jeff used to

40:13.875 --> 40:15.375
but if there's a threat
to this station--

40:15.458 --> 40:16.625
The threat goes far beyond

40:16.708 --> 40:19.167
Babylon 5, Mr. Garibaldi.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.833
I'm not surprised.

40:21.917 --> 40:24.458
If Horn was what you say he was,
then this thing sure as hell

40:24.542 --> 40:26.625
has nothing to do
with Free Mars.

40:26.708 --> 40:29.333
To pull something like this off
would take a lot of power

40:29.417 --> 40:31.000
and a lot of money.

40:32.542 --> 40:34.750
And I think you know who it is.

40:39.292 --> 40:40.583
Alright.

40:42.458 --> 40:45.125
But promise me this information
will never be repeated

40:45.208 --> 40:47.500
outside this room.

40:47.583 --> 40:48.792
You got it.

40:48.875 --> 40:51.167
For the past six years,
there have been rumors

40:51.250 --> 40:53.333
about a rogue agency

40:53.417 --> 40:56.458
operating deep inside EarthGov.

40:56.542 --> 40:59.708
A dirty tricks squad
dealing in black projects

40:59.792 --> 41:01.292
and star chamber justice.

41:01.375 --> 41:05.208
It took me over three years
just to get a name.

41:06.625 --> 41:09.292
Bureau 13..

41:09.375 --> 41:13.042
...and the man who gave me
that name died soon after.

41:13.125 --> 41:14.667
'I am convinced they exist'

41:14.750 --> 41:16.375
and that they are behind
this incident.

41:16.458 --> 41:17.583
Why?

41:17.667 --> 41:20.583
Isogi was a danger
to Earth policy on Mars.

41:20.667 --> 41:24.625
I think his death was a warning
to the other corporations.

41:24.708 --> 41:27.208
I also think Horn was meant
to destroy Free Mars

41:27.292 --> 41:29.875
from the inside and possibly..

41:29.958 --> 41:32.250
...ruin Amanda Carter as well.

41:32.333 --> 41:35.417
Unfortunately,
I can't prove any of it.

41:35.500 --> 41:36.833
If this is true--

41:36.917 --> 41:39.542
Then everything we believe in
is in jeopardy.

41:42.083 --> 41:45.375
There is a spider in the web,
Mr. Garibaldi..

41:48.083 --> 41:50.208
...and I intend to find it..

41:51.542 --> 41:52.792
...and kill it.
