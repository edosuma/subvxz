20:50.875 --> 20:52.002
Mm.

20:52.002 --> 20:54.254
- How'd the babysitting go?
- Piece of cake.

20:54.254 --> 20:55.213
And how'd the spying go?

20:55.213 --> 20:56.756
George did good.

20:58.133 --> 21:00.051
I was a delight.

21:00.051 --> 21:01.886
Mm!

21:03.763 --> 21:05.724
It's nice to know
I can count on you.

21:05.724 --> 21:08.309
Well, Mayan, I'm gonna
be around a long time.

21:08.309 --> 21:09.561
I never told you this,

21:09.561 --> 21:10.854
but I'm so happy
that I dug you out

21:10.854 --> 21:13.773
of the lost and found
at Walmart 35 years ago.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.444
[chuckles]

21:17.444 --> 21:18.862
Wait, where's Tía Daisy?

21:18.862 --> 21:20.697
Oh.

21:20.697 --> 21:23.658
<i>- Attention, shoppers.

21:25.535 --> 21:27.245
I hate this place.
