-Whattup, Katie?

00:21.040 --> 00:23.840
Let me guess.
You're going to Venice Beach.

00:24.400 --> 00:25.680
You know it.

00:27.200 --> 00:29.040
Oh, would you stop foraging?

00:29.120 --> 00:32.040
-Sit down and eat something.
-I can't, Mom. I'm late.

00:32.880 --> 00:34.120
Wait. Did you clean your room?

00:34.200 --> 00:35.840
That's why I'm late.

01:00.680 --> 01:02.520
Maybe something happened to him.

01:02.600 --> 01:04.840
I mean, maybe he got hit by a car.

01:04.960 --> 01:07.920
Or maybe his dad's back
started acting up again,

clean my room before I could leave.

Fine, but we missed the bus.

I'm never gonna get that 540.

Sure you will, just not talking like that.

Jimmy, I'm on a tight schedule here.
Can we get these shots somewhere else?

No. I gotta get a picture
of the Bladz from the pit.

how to get rid of these losers.

06:34.280 --> 06:37.360
Are you gonna do that at the invitational
or save it for the championships?

I don't think you skate so good
anymore, man.

I dunno.
Maybe you should bag both competitions.

06:43.560 --> 06:46.160
Nah. Then I'd have to give back
all this cool stuff.

to save your place.

-Forget about 'em.
-Maybe in a couple of years,

07:37.920 --> 07:40.880
they'll be good enough and someone
will put their pictures in a magazine.

07:42.520 --> 07:43.520
Maybe not.

Come on. Let's go.

Check it out. I've got an idea.

07:58.160 --> 08:00.320
Excuse me. Can I ask you guys a question?

-Yeah.
-Um...

all skateboarders
aren't really wusses, are they?

No! They all can't be no-talent, no-skill,
half-smart, inline-skating wannabes.

I don't think that at all, all right?

But that's exactly what those guys
over there told us.

Today's the first day of school,
and she's miserable.

Because, sweetheart,
home-schooling is expensive.

-Why can't we be Mormons?

are down with this style.

to be going back to work already.

you don't want me to drop you?

of summer vacation couldn't fix.

what happened to Gabriella?

Is she okay?

It's awful.

on the first day of school."

your skateboarder friends to make me?

into some real clothes when I got here.

12:26.080 --> 12:28.840
You mean you're gonna go
through an entire first day of school

12:28.920 --> 12:31.600
wearing those for me?

12:33.640 --> 12:35.920
Just take 'em before I change my mind,
okay?

12:36.680 --> 12:39.040
Oh, man, did you guys see that?

12:39.640 --> 12:41.280
Soul Skaters.

12:41.360 --> 12:43.640
Together, there's nothing we can't do.

12:43.720 --> 12:45.200
That's right, guys. Soul Skaters.

12:45.280 --> 12:46.840
-Yes!
-Right!

12:46.920 --> 12:48.200
[school bell rings]

12:48.280 --> 12:52.280
[male teacher]
"Earthworm" is the common name

12:52.360 --> 12:58.320
that is given
to over 1,000 different species of worms

12:58.960 --> 13:02.160
in a class of the annelid phylum.

13:04.080 --> 13:06.400
Earthworms are cylindrical in shape.

13:07.120 --> 13:10.120
[Peter] Yo, man. Are we gonna
have Val on our cases all year?

13:12.480 --> 13:14.040
I got a plan.

13:15.720 --> 13:19.800
Brink, my man, Val's not exactly playing
with the full deck.

13:20.320 --> 13:22.360
Let's not do anything we're gonna regret.

13:22.440 --> 13:24.360
[shushes] Hey.

13:25.400 --> 13:26.560
What's the plan?

13:26.640 --> 13:30.760
[teacher] ...grow as large as 11 feet.
Imagine that.

13:39.840 --> 13:41.280
Oh, man!

13:41.360 --> 13:44.560
Oh, wow, I'm so sorry.

13:55.560 --> 13:56.800
[groans]

14:08.440 --> 14:10.680
-See ya, buddy.
-Hey, you're not finished, man.

14:12.480 --> 14:13.640
What's his problem?

14:13.720 --> 14:16.160
He's a Soul Skater.
That's his problem, dude.

14:16.960 --> 14:18.440
[squishing]

14:19.640 --> 14:20.960
Ugh!

14:28.080 --> 14:29.080
Worms!

14:32.760 --> 14:34.560
Is there a problem, Val?

14:41.480 --> 14:45.040
No. I thought I saw a bug or something.

14:45.600 --> 14:47.000
Well, get over it.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
[Brink] Hey.

14:54.080 --> 14:57.080
You know, in some countries,
worms are considered a delicacy.

14:57.160 --> 14:58.880
-Go figure.
-[laughs]

14:58.960 --> 15:00.000
You,

15:00.840 --> 15:01.840
us,

15:02.400 --> 15:03.400
right now, out back.

15:10.160 --> 15:12.440
Fight, fight! Hey, guys, check it out!

15:18.040 --> 15:20.480
Say, it's very nice, Val.

15:20.560 --> 15:23.480
Have you ever thought about working
with garbage cans for a living?

15:24.280 --> 15:26.000
Do you ever give
that mouth of yours a rest?

15:26.080 --> 15:27.520
I don't know.

15:27.600 --> 15:28.680
Do I?

15:32.040 --> 15:36.240
Personally,
I just want to pound the snot outta ya.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.680
Boomer suggested a race instead.

15:40.480 --> 15:41.840
We race.

15:41.920 --> 15:43.200
You win,

15:44.000 --> 15:45.560
we stop giving you beef.

15:46.080 --> 15:47.240
You lose...

15:48.280 --> 15:52.000
and, man, it's like open season
on your butts.

15:53.440 --> 15:55.240
-Deal?
-Come on.

15:55.320 --> 15:57.120
You know there's no skating
allowed at school.

15:58.760 --> 16:00.800
Yeah. I knew you couldn't step up.

16:01.640 --> 16:02.840
What did I tell ya?

16:03.880 --> 16:05.240
No heart.

16:05.360 --> 16:06.960
[boy] Oh, burn!

16:11.440 --> 16:12.440
Let's do it.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.480
Brink, you'll get in trouble, man.

16:20.360 --> 16:23.040
Dude, we're gonna have to skate
against these guys sooner or later.

16:23.120 --> 16:24.240
Why not sooner?

16:24.800 --> 16:26.040
Yeah. Why not?

16:27.000 --> 16:28.400
All right, we go side by side.

16:28.480 --> 16:31.680
When you get to the relay point,
you've got to slap the next guy's hand.

16:31.760 --> 16:32.960
Or girl's hand.

16:33.040 --> 16:34.120
Thank you.

16:35.280 --> 16:37.320
Whatever. Before he can go.

16:37.400 --> 16:39.200
Or "she" can go.

16:39.280 --> 16:41.920
-Thank you.
-[Val] Chrissy, call the start.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.280
Let's go.

16:48.880 --> 16:50.320
All right, on your marks...

16:50.400 --> 16:51.400
You don't talk much.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.200
Get set...

16:53.280 --> 16:54.440
I like that in a man.

16:54.760 --> 16:55.760
Go!

17:00.280 --> 17:02.120
Come on, Gabriella, let's go.

17:11.200 --> 17:13.240
-Go, buddy!
-Get ready to lose the race.

17:25.760 --> 17:26.840
Let's go!

17:35.400 --> 17:36.800
C'mon, Boomer, you wuss!

17:40.240 --> 17:41.880
Brink! What are you doing?

17:42.680 --> 17:45.160
Boomer, just lay still, man.
This happened to me last summer.

17:45.240 --> 17:48.200
You just gotta lay still and lie down.
Just don't get up.

17:48.280 --> 17:50.400
Kimball, go get the nurse.
Tell her to bring some ice.

17:50.480 --> 17:52.200
-Go!
-What are you doing?

17:52.280 --> 17:54.200
Dude, I'm gonna have the nurse
take a look at it.

17:54.280 --> 17:55.320
Brink, man! The race!

17:56.120 --> 17:58.760
-Relax. Just relax.
-You lost the race to help me?

17:59.520 --> 18:00.880
Brink, man, I don't get you.

18:01.360 --> 18:02.360
Take a number.

18:03.680 --> 18:04.680
What's going on?

18:04.760 --> 18:05.920
Teachers! Teachers!

18:07.680 --> 18:08.680
Nice.

18:11.640 --> 18:12.800
[Boomer groans]

18:16.040 --> 18:18.240
I think it's a record.
I'm pretty sure it is.

18:19.120 --> 18:20.760
-Yo, Dad. Please.
-What was it?

18:20.840 --> 18:23.200
Four and a half hours into the school year
before being suspended?

18:23.280 --> 18:26.000
It's only for today.
Besides, I can explain--

18:26.080 --> 18:28.240
Don't, wait.
I'll just read about it in the papers.

18:28.320 --> 18:30.800
A record like this has got
to attract media attention.

18:30.880 --> 18:34.640
Dad, Val and his crew were dissing us,
so we started giving 'em beef right back,

18:34.720 --> 18:36.520
and then they wanted to hit it
right there.

18:36.600 --> 18:38.880
And, clearly, we couldn't step off,
so we had to battle.

18:40.480 --> 18:41.480
Who are you?

18:42.320 --> 18:43.760
What have you done with my son?

18:43.840 --> 18:45.400
God, Dad...

18:46.320 --> 18:48.160
Don't they teach English at your school?

18:48.680 --> 18:50.960
Wait a minute. What am I asking you for?

18:51.040 --> 18:52.960
You haven't been there long enough
to find out.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.480
Dad, you're not listening to me.

18:54.560 --> 18:55.600
Sure I am.

18:56.440 --> 18:58.920
You got dissed. You ate "beef."
Did I miss anything?

18:59.000 --> 19:00.440
[car engine sputters]

19:01.880 --> 19:02.880
Great!

19:03.680 --> 19:05.520
Lovely. Just lovely.

19:23.240 --> 19:27.640
Well, let's recap, shall we?
The car's gonna cost us $900.

19:27.720 --> 19:31.680
The dentist called to say that if we don't
spend 300 bucks on Katie's night brace,

19:31.760 --> 19:33.960
she's gonna have a smile
like a Picasso painting.

19:35.240 --> 19:38.040
I called Beckman today to see
if there would be a job waiting for me

19:38.120 --> 19:39.320
when my disability was over,

19:39.400 --> 19:42.080
and he said
that he couldn't promise anything,

19:42.640 --> 19:46.400
and your son was suspended from school
on his first day.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.120
So, how was your day?

19:50.680 --> 19:52.000
It was fine.

19:52.080 --> 19:53.320
Sell any houses?

19:53.400 --> 19:54.680
Uh, no.

19:54.760 --> 19:55.920
Show any houses?

19:56.640 --> 19:57.640
No.

19:57.720 --> 19:59.760
Well, then, our troubles are over.

19:59.880 --> 20:01.680
Oh, come on. Be nice.

20:02.200 --> 20:03.280
Sorry.

20:03.360 --> 20:04.440
It's gonna be okay.

20:05.040 --> 20:07.280
Ralph, we have been through
much worse than this.

20:07.360 --> 20:08.440
If you say so.

20:08.560 --> 20:11.120
Ralph, do you remember
when you fell off that beam?

20:11.200 --> 20:13.960
Honey, we didn't even know
if you were gonna walk again.

20:14.640 --> 20:16.640
Yeah. I'd say that was worse.

20:17.560 --> 20:18.720
And now look at you.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.720
Strutting around.
You can't wait to get back to work.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.160
All I need is my job back.

20:24.840 --> 20:26.880
Don't worry about the money.

20:27.800 --> 20:29.440
We're gonna be okay.

20:30.880 --> 20:33.360
The mortgage isn't due
until the first of the month.

20:36.280 --> 20:39.200
We'll figure it out. We always do.

20:44.640 --> 20:46.800
Well, there was screaming
and then yelling,

20:46.880 --> 20:48.720
and then there was crying and hugging.

20:49.200 --> 20:51.080
It was all very Peruvian.

20:52.400 --> 20:54.320
How did your fam deal with it, Jordy?

20:55.600 --> 20:59.400
Well, there was sitting and staring...

21:00.400 --> 21:01.560
and then afterwards,

21:02.240 --> 21:04.280
there was some more sitting and staring.

21:04.720 --> 21:07.880
I mean, for all I know, my parents
are still in the living room,

21:08.600 --> 21:10.800
sitting and staring.

21:10.880 --> 21:15.240
Yeah, well, Jerry handled it kinda the way
it was done at Gabriella's.

21:15.800 --> 21:18.560
There was screaming, yelling,
crying, and hugging.

21:19.520 --> 21:20.600
Only without the hugging.

21:21.360 --> 21:24.560
My mother was conveniently hiding
in the next room.

21:25.480 --> 21:27.040
Hey, at least you got two parents.

21:28.080 --> 21:30.840
I got a Mom and a Jerry.

21:31.880 --> 21:34.240
Do the math. That's one parent.

21:35.040 --> 21:39.120
Look, guys, things got a little
out of hand the other day, you know.

21:39.200 --> 21:43.640
We just gotta chill
and let things blow over. All right?

21:43.720 --> 21:46.480
Hey, check it out. Jerkweeds at 02:00.

21:47.240 --> 21:48.680
Hiya, children.

21:49.320 --> 21:54.760
Excuse me, but I believe we out-skated
your sorry butts yesterday, old man.

21:54.840 --> 21:57.240
-Anytime you want to go at it again--
-Cut it out.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.280
I guess you heard about Boomer?

22:02.360 --> 22:04.160
Yeah. How long's he gonna be out?

22:04.720 --> 22:07.760
A couple of weeks.
For sure, he's out of the invitational.

22:09.400 --> 22:11.120
Means there's an open spot on the team.

22:12.760 --> 22:13.800
Yeah, right.

22:13.880 --> 22:16.040
Like we're gonna try out for Team X-Bladz.

22:16.560 --> 22:18.600
Like any of you have the talent.

22:19.720 --> 22:22.840
I'm telling you so that you grommets
know you're not invited.

22:22.920 --> 22:25.280
Good. You told us. Now, beat it!

22:25.360 --> 22:26.440
[scoffs]

22:27.040 --> 22:28.080
You don't get it, do you?

22:29.920 --> 22:31.720
Being a sponsored skater is cool.

22:32.600 --> 22:34.720
I get all the newest gear
whenever I need it,

22:34.800 --> 22:38.000
I get my picture
in every skating magazine on the planet--

22:38.080 --> 22:40.080
Oh, now I'm nauseous.

22:41.040 --> 22:43.120
And I make a lot of money.

22:46.280 --> 22:47.520
Just think about that.

22:48.440 --> 22:53.120
Being known as the best
and getting paid at the same time.

22:55.440 --> 22:56.760
What could be sweeter?

22:58.360 --> 22:59.360
Hey, look.

22:59.440 --> 23:01.200
We don't care about any of that stuff.

23:02.080 --> 23:03.240
We skate for fun.

23:03.680 --> 23:04.960
We're Soul Skaters.

23:05.400 --> 23:06.400
Right, Brink?

23:09.280 --> 23:10.880
Right... right.

23:12.720 --> 23:16.360
Why is it that the losers
always say they're in it for fun?

23:17.760 --> 23:19.120
C'mon.

23:21.520 --> 23:23.080
Could you believe that guy?

23:23.560 --> 23:25.960
-Skatin' for money.
-What a sellout.

23:29.320 --> 23:30.440
Think he'll show?

23:30.960 --> 23:32.000
You know it.

23:35.200 --> 23:37.000
Okay, dude, give us the 540.

23:37.080 --> 23:38.840
I want to see it laid out and inverted.

23:38.920 --> 23:40.000
You can do it.

23:50.680 --> 23:51.960
Aw, man.

23:54.240 --> 23:56.000
There's gotta be a better way to do this.

23:56.080 --> 23:58.240
There is. Don't fall.

24:01.720 --> 24:02.880
You okay, dude?

24:03.760 --> 24:04.960
Yeah, man.

24:05.640 --> 24:08.280
Hey, what's up with you today?
You're looking so sketchy.

24:08.360 --> 24:09.680
Nothing, man. I'm fine.

24:10.280 --> 24:11.440
Cool.

24:13.360 --> 24:17.040
Hey, guys, look, I gotta get going.
I've got this family thing this afternoon.

24:18.200 --> 24:20.880
Wait a minute. What about our session?

24:20.960 --> 24:22.800
The invitational's in two weeks.

24:22.880 --> 24:25.240
It's the last competition
before the championship.

24:26.240 --> 24:27.400
Yeah, I know.

24:27.880 --> 24:31.760
Look, you guys keep on training,
and Peter, keep working on that 540.

24:31.840 --> 24:34.080
And I'll do some of my own stuff
on my own, all right?

24:34.840 --> 24:36.840
-Okay.
-All right.

24:39.320 --> 24:40.400
Bye.

25:01.360 --> 25:04.000
[loud rock music playing]

25:28.800 --> 25:30.320
[music stops]

25:31.960 --> 25:33.840
All right. That's it for now.

25:33.920 --> 25:35.960
I've got your numbers.
I'll call you if you made it.

25:48.400 --> 25:49.360
What about Brad?

25:50.000 --> 25:51.280
No good. Too buckled.

25:51.840 --> 25:53.680
-Right?
-Yeah.

25:54.320 --> 25:55.360
Markoff?

25:55.440 --> 25:57.560
No way. Nobody wants to session with him.

25:57.640 --> 25:58.880
We only need him for one month.

25:58.960 --> 26:01.400
And after that,
never got to talk to him again.

26:02.120 --> 26:03.360
What do you think, Beej?

26:03.440 --> 26:04.800
No, man. I don't think so.

26:06.240 --> 26:08.800
Too bad your secret weapon was a no-show.

26:10.800 --> 26:11.880
I don't believe it.

26:18.160 --> 26:21.160
What did I tell ya? Watch this.

26:21.800 --> 26:24.400
No way, man. No way.

26:24.480 --> 26:25.720
How much?

26:25.800 --> 26:26.920
What?

26:28.480 --> 26:30.040
Does X-Bladz pay?

26:30.120 --> 26:31.520
How much?

26:31.600 --> 26:35.480
Well, $200 a week, plus all equipment.

26:35.560 --> 26:38.480
Plus an extra $200 bonus for each of us
when we win tournaments,

26:38.560 --> 26:41.760
but there's no way
I'm gonna let you on the team.

26:41.840 --> 26:45.160
Yeah, well, there's no way
I wanted to be here but I need the money.

26:45.240 --> 26:47.360
What for, Grandma needs a new kidney?

26:48.800 --> 26:51.520
Besides, I thought you were a...
What do you guys call that?

26:51.600 --> 26:53.920
Oh, Soul Skater.

26:54.560 --> 26:57.920
So, how about you turn around
and "soul skate" on out of here?

26:58.000 --> 26:59.760
Yeah, Brink, man, get out of here.

27:02.280 --> 27:03.280
Fine.

27:05.360 --> 27:06.480
Wait a second.

27:10.960 --> 27:13.480
You've got 30 seconds. Street run.

27:14.520 --> 27:15.720
One chance.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.280
♪ <i>Okay, let's do it</i> ♪

27:44.480 --> 27:45.720
Time's up.

27:49.280 --> 27:50.560
How are you on vert?

27:50.640 --> 27:52.520
Just as good as street. Maybe better.

27:52.840 --> 27:54.960
-Downhill?
-I can do it all.

27:55.560 --> 27:58.160
Hey, how about Peter and the rest?
They know you're doing this?

27:58.720 --> 27:59.920
What?

28:00.000 --> 28:02.760
This is gonna be good. I can't wait
to see the look on their faces.

28:02.840 --> 28:03.880
No way.

28:04.720 --> 28:06.560
Look, this is just
through the invitational

28:06.640 --> 28:08.440
until Boomer's back on his feet.

28:08.800 --> 28:12.240
If this gets out, then I don't skate
with you, and you've got nobody.

28:12.560 --> 28:13.560
You got that?

28:14.640 --> 28:17.240
Hey, we won't say anything,

28:17.320 --> 28:19.640
but you have to be at every practice.

28:20.440 --> 28:21.440
All right.

28:22.840 --> 28:23.840
And...

28:25.080 --> 28:26.960
no more bagging on me in front of people.

28:27.840 --> 28:30.880
From now on,
you start showing me some respect.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.280
You got that?

28:34.720 --> 28:36.040
Yeah. I got it.

28:37.880 --> 28:39.040
Let's go see Jimmy.

28:42.320 --> 28:45.120
Oh! You went big there, my man.

28:45.400 --> 28:47.880
[laughs] You see, Andy--

28:47.960 --> 28:49.720
Oh, you mind if I call you Andy?

28:49.800 --> 28:51.200
Brink. I like Brink.

28:51.280 --> 28:55.080
Brink. I love that. Brink. [laughs]

28:55.160 --> 28:58.240
Yeah. See, that's what X-Bladz
is all about, my man, going big.

28:59.000 --> 29:02.160
I'm in 1,200 outlets nationwide.

29:02.240 --> 29:06.280
Last year, I moved
over $10 million worth of merchandise.

29:06.800 --> 29:09.040
And all because of Team X-Bladz.

29:10.080 --> 29:15.880
So, I guess the big question is,
are you ready to go big for X-Bladz?

29:17.560 --> 29:18.560
Big as you want.

29:19.720 --> 29:22.720
Did you hear that? As big as I want.

29:23.120 --> 29:26.440
You better watch your back. This boy
here's liable to put you out of a job.

29:26.520 --> 29:28.920
[scoffs] Don't worry about that, Jimmy.

29:29.680 --> 29:34.160
So, Val told you about the money
and how that works.

29:34.240 --> 29:35.720
You're okay with that, right?

29:36.880 --> 29:38.800
-Yeah.
-All right. Then it's official then.

29:39.840 --> 29:41.080
You're part of the team.

29:42.160 --> 29:46.640
From now on, there'll be no competing
unless you're flying the X-Bladz colors.

29:46.720 --> 29:48.320
-You got that?
-All right.

29:48.400 --> 29:50.360
All right? I'm gonna need you 24/7

29:50.440 --> 29:53.120
for, like, photo shoots, promos,
industry shows, stuff like that.

29:55.320 --> 29:57.640
-Okay.
-Okay.

29:58.240 --> 29:59.520
[chuckles]

29:59.600 --> 30:00.880
Well, then...

30:04.720 --> 30:06.480
Parents? Your parents know about this?

30:06.560 --> 30:07.840
-My parents?
-They're down with this?

30:07.920 --> 30:10.080
-They're cool with this?
-Oh, my parents. Yeah.

30:10.160 --> 30:12.120
All right. Okay.

30:12.200 --> 30:15.320
Well, then, welcome to Team X-Bladz.

30:23.920 --> 30:25.440
What's up, Katie?

30:25.520 --> 30:26.720
What's in the bag?

30:28.960 --> 30:29.960
Just my stuff.

30:30.040 --> 30:32.120
You got more stuff now than when you left.

30:32.200 --> 30:33.680
What's in the bag?

30:35.320 --> 30:36.320
None-ya.

30:37.440 --> 30:38.400
None-ya?

30:38.520 --> 30:40.440
None-ya-business.

30:40.840 --> 30:42.160
[chuckles]

31:03.320 --> 31:04.320
Whoa...

31:08.000 --> 31:10.320
Oh, cool.

31:12.760 --> 31:14.000
Wait a second.

31:34.440 --> 31:37.120
Oh, man, what am I doing?

31:42.480 --> 31:43.760
[Ralph chuckles]

31:43.840 --> 31:46.640
Katie, honey, why don't you
slow down a little bit?

31:46.720 --> 31:49.480
What's the point of having
a fast metabolism if I don't use it?

31:50.600 --> 31:52.120
Well, she's got something there.

31:52.880 --> 31:54.920
Andy, are you okay?
You've hardly eaten anything.

31:56.440 --> 31:57.640
Um...

31:58.600 --> 32:00.360
With Dad not working around here,
and stuff,

32:01.240 --> 32:05.040
I think that maybe it's time I got a job
to help out around here.

32:05.120 --> 32:07.400
You know, with the money, and stuff.

32:07.480 --> 32:10.920
Oh, Andy, that is a wonderful offer,
but you don't have to do that.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.280
Mr. Beckman's gonna give Dad his job back.

32:13.360 --> 32:16.720
And I just showed a house today to some
people. I think they're very interested.

32:16.800 --> 32:19.360
No, no, no. Wait a second.

32:20.440 --> 32:21.440
I think it's good.

32:25.200 --> 32:27.120
What kind of a job are you talking about?

32:27.200 --> 32:29.760
Well, I know these kids
who make extra money skating.

32:30.320 --> 32:31.320
Skating?

32:31.840 --> 32:34.120
Yeah. You see,
they got on a sponsored team,

32:34.720 --> 32:37.160
and then the sponsor pays them
to wear their gear and stuff.

32:37.520 --> 32:40.040
It's kind of like... advertising.

32:40.120 --> 32:42.200
I thought you skated just for fun.

32:42.280 --> 32:44.640
Maybe he could save it for school.

32:44.720 --> 32:47.120
How much money
does a sponsored skater make?

32:47.200 --> 32:48.400
A couple hundred a week.

32:48.880 --> 32:49.960
More if the team wins.

32:50.040 --> 32:51.280
Whoa.

32:51.360 --> 32:53.640
A couple hundred bucks a week. I like.

32:53.720 --> 32:54.760
That's a lot of money.

32:56.760 --> 32:57.800
No.

32:57.880 --> 33:00.400
But, Dad, I'm thinking,
like, the car needs fixing.

33:00.480 --> 33:02.160
-No.
-What?

33:02.880 --> 33:06.720
Isn't this the kid who was just suspended
from school for...

33:06.800 --> 33:08.800
Jeez, what was it?

33:09.840 --> 33:11.160
Skating.

33:11.240 --> 33:12.840
Thank you, sweetheart.

33:12.920 --> 33:13.960
Skating.

33:14.040 --> 33:17.680
Yeah. What do we need him
to be on a sponsored team for?

33:17.760 --> 33:21.520
So he can spend all of his time thinking
about skating, instead of just most of it?

33:23.000 --> 33:25.760
Look, buddy, you want to get a job,
I think that's great.

33:26.600 --> 33:27.720
But not skating.

33:28.800 --> 33:31.360
Dad, it's $200 a week.

33:31.440 --> 33:33.320
Not skating!

33:40.360 --> 33:42.720
So, Jordy, he hits the rail,

33:42.800 --> 33:46.280
pulls it halfway,
and then he lands it right on his crotch!

33:46.360 --> 33:48.280
<i>Oh, man, the poor dude got worked.</i>

33:48.360 --> 33:51.400
<i>I thought Gabriella was gonna need oxygen,</i>
<i>she was laughing so hard.</i>

33:52.040 --> 33:56.320
I thought he should put some ice on it,
but he just kept saying, "No ice! No ice!"

33:56.400 --> 33:58.000
-[knocking]
-[Jerry] I need the phone.

33:58.080 --> 34:01.040
<i>Hold on a second.</i>
<i>You can use it when I'm done.</i>

34:02.200 --> 34:06.160
You know, we did okay after you took off,
but it just wasn't the same without you.

34:07.760 --> 34:09.480
C'mon, man. You don't mean that.

34:10.320 --> 34:13.160
Excuse me?
You're the captain of our team, remember?

34:13.560 --> 34:15.760
<i>We can't have our captain</i>
<i>missing any more sessions.</i>

34:15.840 --> 34:18.480
Hey, Peter, there's something
I gotta tell you right now, man.

34:18.560 --> 34:19.720
-Wait a second.
-Now, Peter!

34:19.800 --> 34:21.000
I'm getting off.

34:21.480 --> 34:22.520
Brink, man, I'm sorry.

34:22.600 --> 34:26.400
Stepdad Of The Year is about to go postal
on me if I don't let him use the phone.

34:26.960 --> 34:29.400
-I'll see you at school tomorrow.
-Wait, wait. Pete, Pete!

34:29.960 --> 34:31.120
-[dial tone]
-God!

34:37.840 --> 34:39.160
You need more baking powder.

34:39.720 --> 34:40.880
What?

34:40.960 --> 34:43.440
The recipe has a large T
next to the number.

34:43.520 --> 34:44.960
That means tablespoon.

34:45.680 --> 34:48.240
A small T means teaspoon.

34:48.760 --> 34:51.160
-Why are you even watching me?
-There you go.

34:52.520 --> 34:54.600
Hey, you okay, man? It's only a cake.

34:55.320 --> 34:56.440
Yeah, yeah.

35:00.760 --> 35:01.760
Hey, uh...

35:02.400 --> 35:05.440
Did you guys ever notice that
baking a cake is a lot like friendship?

35:07.760 --> 35:08.840
Excuse me?

35:09.320 --> 35:10.440
No, I mean...

35:11.400 --> 35:13.440
All right.
You put a lot of work into it, right?

35:13.520 --> 35:16.520
And sometimes it doesn't turn out
the way you expected it to...

35:18.000 --> 35:19.480
but it still tastes good.

35:22.400 --> 35:24.760
I told you not to eat
that spoonful of frosting.

35:24.840 --> 35:26.360
Yeah, man, sugar can mess you up.

35:26.480 --> 35:29.280
It's true. I have this cousin,
and she's not allowed to eat any sugar.

35:29.360 --> 35:31.640
But one day, she had, like,
four jellybeans

35:31.720 --> 35:33.600
and bounced off the walls like a pinball.

35:33.680 --> 35:35.040
-It was like--
-Shut up, Jordy.

35:35.440 --> 35:36.480
Please.

35:38.320 --> 35:40.280
Guys, there's something
I'm trying to tell you.

35:40.360 --> 35:43.720
-There you go with that "guy" stuff again.
-Gabriella, chill out for a second.

35:44.800 --> 35:46.640
I got to talk to you guys
about the invitational.

35:46.720 --> 35:48.760
Oh, yeah.
We're gonna have a good time, huh?

35:49.320 --> 35:51.560
-Sweet.
-Hey, Betty Crockers.

35:52.320 --> 35:56.000
Oh, love the aprons.

35:56.800 --> 35:59.680
So, how's the training going?

36:00.200 --> 36:02.520
I mean, the invitational's
right around the corner.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.120
Last two years,
the team that won the invitational

36:05.200 --> 36:07.160
did go on to win the championship.

36:08.280 --> 36:10.200
Now, what team was that?

36:10.840 --> 36:11.920
Hmm...

36:12.640 --> 36:14.000
That's right.

36:14.680 --> 36:16.240
Team X-Bladz.

36:16.320 --> 36:18.920
Val, could you be any more of a jerk?

36:21.040 --> 36:22.280
No, I don't think so.

36:24.680 --> 36:25.800
Is that what you think?

36:27.200 --> 36:28.640
You think I'm a jerk?

36:28.720 --> 36:29.760
Uh...

36:31.720 --> 36:33.280
Come on, Val. We're working here, man.

36:33.600 --> 36:36.200
Hey, I asked you something.

36:39.480 --> 36:40.840
Do you think I'm a jerk?

36:44.200 --> 36:45.200
No.

36:46.640 --> 36:48.160
Excuse me?

36:51.280 --> 36:53.720
No. I don't think you're a jerk.

36:53.800 --> 36:55.040
Oh...

36:55.480 --> 36:56.760
Thank you.

36:58.840 --> 37:00.040
See you this afternoon, Brink.

37:04.960 --> 37:06.400
Yo, buddy. What happened?

37:07.760 --> 37:10.520
Yeah, what's up with that?
You just let Val slime all over you.

37:12.040 --> 37:13.360
He's not worth it.

37:14.240 --> 37:16.240
What did he mean
he'd see you this afternoon?

37:17.400 --> 37:18.520
Uh...

37:19.360 --> 37:20.360
Who knows?

37:22.560 --> 37:24.120
[rock music playing]

37:48.840 --> 37:50.200
Hey, man, good job.

37:50.280 --> 37:52.120
-Thanks, man.
-That was rad, Brink.

37:53.320 --> 37:54.400
What was that?

37:55.760 --> 37:56.880
Excuse me?

37:56.960 --> 37:59.200
I just wanted to know what that was.

37:59.280 --> 38:02.200
Because if you call that going big,
I'm gonna quit skating.

38:03.560 --> 38:05.280
Well, we're all gonna miss you, buddy.

38:05.360 --> 38:07.160
[laughs] Gotcha.

38:12.320 --> 38:13.600
Hit it again.

38:15.720 --> 38:17.200
You're kidding me, right?

38:17.280 --> 38:19.520
Hit it again.

38:21.640 --> 38:23.160
Come on, Val. He's doing okay.

38:23.280 --> 38:24.840
Who's running the show here?

38:25.680 --> 38:26.720
Who?

38:27.880 --> 38:28.920
You.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
That's right.

38:34.320 --> 38:35.360
Do it or vacate.

38:48.640 --> 38:49.680
Good doggy.

39:02.560 --> 39:04.160
Maybe something happened to him.

39:04.240 --> 39:05.520
Like what?

39:05.600 --> 39:08.160
And please don't start
with that alien stuff again.

39:10.080 --> 39:11.480
Yo. Whattup?

39:11.560 --> 39:12.920
[Peter] Where've you been, man?

39:13.040 --> 39:14.760
We've been waiting here for two hours.

39:14.840 --> 39:16.360
I got to be home by 5:30.

39:16.440 --> 39:18.080
Jerry's having his boss over for dinner,

39:18.160 --> 39:21.040
and I gotta pretend
I worship the ground he walks on.

39:21.120 --> 39:24.200
Well, then, what are we all doing
standing around talking?

39:25.080 --> 39:28.120
Hey, did you guys hear?
Val found someone to replace Boomer.

39:28.200 --> 39:29.680
Yeah, I heard that too.

39:29.760 --> 39:32.080
Yeah. I heard it too.

39:32.160 --> 39:36.040
I heard the guy was a big guy.
Big guy. Like, Korean, I think.

39:36.120 --> 39:38.680
Wait, no. He was Native American.
Yeah. That was it.

39:38.760 --> 39:40.400

-Hey.

I don't care how good he is,
he isn't better than my man here.

39:46.600 --> 39:49.520
Look. That just means
we've got to hit it twice as hard.

39:49.600 --> 39:50.800
So let's do it.

39:54.520 --> 39:56.680
Yeah. Let's do it.

real knowledge of automotive mechanics.

40:15.760 --> 40:17.200
What's the matter with you?

40:18.280 --> 40:20.360
Nothing, really. I'm just a little tired.

40:20.800 --> 40:22.160
Too much skating?

40:22.240 --> 40:25.920
Skating? Too much? Me? No way.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.920
Well, you won't have to worry
about that anymore.

40:29.920 --> 40:31.280
I got you a job.

40:32.640 --> 40:34.280
A job?

40:37.200 --> 40:40.440
My friend, Benny,
he's got the dog grooming place.

40:40.520 --> 40:43.560
He's looking for somebody to help out
a couple of afternoons a week.

40:45.120 --> 40:48.720
Well, that's great, Dad,
but I don't know a thing about animals.

40:49.600 --> 40:51.480
You babysit your sister, Katie, don't you?

40:52.400 --> 40:53.840
Can't be a lot different than that.

40:55.920 --> 40:58.960
Come on. What's wrong? I thought
you wanted to help out around here.

40:59.240 --> 41:00.760
Oh, no, Dad, I do.

41:00.840 --> 41:02.840
I just don't have the time for a job
right now.

41:02.920 --> 41:03.920
Why?

41:05.520 --> 41:06.960

or "fine" as in "leave me alone"?

like talking about it, okay?

54:07.920 --> 54:10.080
The two teams with the highest scores
on street and vert

54:10.160 --> 54:12.040
send one person right here.

54:14.520 --> 54:18.640
Yo! Earth to Brink!
Pay attention. What are you looking at?

54:20.480 --> 54:23.840
Well, I was just thinking
how fun it might be

54:24.520 --> 54:27.040
to do a launch
off one of those driveways right there,

54:27.120 --> 54:28.880
go up and over the roof of the next house,

54:28.960 --> 54:30.800
and land right back on the road below.

54:32.760 --> 54:33.920
Fun?

54:34.680 --> 54:36.600
Yeah. Fun.

54:37.600 --> 54:41.760
Well, if you don't mind coming back
from fantasy land for a minute...

54:43.680 --> 54:44.960
This is about winning.

54:45.880 --> 54:47.040
Not fun.

54:48.240 --> 54:50.400
[Gabriella] Oh, this is just great.

54:50.880 --> 54:52.840
I guess they'll let anybody skate here.

54:52.920 --> 54:56.320
-What, are you guys following us?
-We came to use the downhill course.

54:56.400 --> 54:59.080
Well, when we're done with it,
it's all yours.

54:59.160 --> 55:00.240
When's that gonna be?

55:01.200 --> 55:02.600
After the championship.

55:02.680 --> 55:03.920
[all snickering]

55:04.520 --> 55:06.680
-Come on, now, run along.
-This is a free country.

55:06.760 --> 55:08.440
We can be here if we want.

55:08.520 --> 55:12.880
Look. If you don't like it here,
why don't you go back to Mexico?

55:13.640 --> 55:15.880
I'm from Peru, <i>estupido.</i>

55:18.200 --> 55:19.440
I'll make you a deal.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.800
How about we race to see
who stays and who goes?

55:22.880 --> 55:24.960
One of you against one of us.

55:25.640 --> 55:27.560
Come on, man. Just let 'em have it.

55:27.680 --> 55:29.120
Why don't you just stay out of this?

55:30.040 --> 55:31.680
Yeah. We can handle ourselves.

55:31.760 --> 55:33.320
Let's see. Who's skating for your crew?

55:33.400 --> 55:34.920
-Me.
-[laughing]

55:35.520 --> 55:36.640
Cool.

55:38.920 --> 55:41.360
-You ready?
-What?

55:41.440 --> 55:44.840
You against Gabriella.
Whoever loses has to take off.

55:45.640 --> 55:47.000
And you'd better not lose, man.

55:47.560 --> 55:49.800
Come on, man. You can't make me do that.

55:49.880 --> 55:52.320
Come on, man. What, are you afraid?

55:58.760 --> 56:00.760
I'm not skating against you.

56:00.880 --> 56:03.360
Why not? You've been doing it for weeks.

56:05.000 --> 56:06.920
Cool. We'll go down to the beach.

56:07.000 --> 56:08.360
First one there wins.

56:09.120 --> 56:12.320
I'll skate down to the finish line
to make sure there's no cheating.

56:14.680 --> 56:17.640
There's a big turn just before Kettner.
Stay on the outside.

56:20.120 --> 56:21.640
What? Wait.

56:23.080 --> 56:25.160
You never stay on the outside of a turn.

56:27.800 --> 56:29.040
Just do it.

56:36.360 --> 56:38.360
Gabriella, please don't do this.

56:38.840 --> 56:40.280
When you woke up this morning,

56:40.360 --> 56:43.560
did you say to yourself,
"Today, I'm gonna talk,"

56:43.640 --> 56:45.600
or "Today, I'm gonna skate"?

56:45.680 --> 56:48.720
-Okay. On your marks!
-Oh, and...

56:48.800 --> 56:50.560
-Get set.
-...don't hold back.

56:50.640 --> 56:51.760
Go!

Thank God, Gabriella's doing fine.

Nothing's broken.

I'm really sorry.

1:00:22.680 --> 1:00:25.040
I honestly didn't think
anyone would get hurt.

1:00:26.320 --> 1:00:28.400
Then I guess for once
you didn't think of everything.

1:00:31.880 --> 1:00:33.800
But, Gab, you gotta understand--

1:00:33.880 --> 1:00:36.320
You were the one who told me
about Soul-Skating.

1:00:37.520 --> 1:00:38.920
About skating from the heart...

1:00:40.640 --> 1:00:42.400
and only skating for the love of it.

1:00:44.840 --> 1:00:46.840
And I believed you
because you were my friend.

1:00:47.680 --> 1:00:49.640
But it was only gonna be
for a little while.

1:00:51.040 --> 1:00:52.560
My family really needed the money.

That's how it starts, you know?

1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:11.880
First, you do something
that you really love...

1:01:13.560 --> 1:01:15.480
and then you start doing it for the money.

1:01:16.480 --> 1:01:17.760
And before you know it...

1:01:21.480 --> 1:01:22.960
you're just another sellout.

Just, um...

1:02:00.120 --> 1:02:01.560
looking at my old skates.

1:02:05.560 --> 1:02:07.360
Why did you and Mom save all these?

1:02:07.720 --> 1:02:08.800
I don't know.

1:02:11.080 --> 1:02:12.960
Maybe we were planning
on having another kid.

1:02:14.800 --> 1:02:17.400
Or maybe just because
we're a couple of pack rats

1:02:17.480 --> 1:02:18.800
that never throw away anything.

1:02:24.160 --> 1:02:25.760
I remember when I got you these.

1:02:27.400 --> 1:02:31.160
You were four, maybe five years old.

1:02:32.800 --> 1:02:34.640
I figured, hell, I liked skating...

1:02:36.400 --> 1:02:37.640
maybe he will too.

it was going to take over your life.

I tried out for the sponsored team.

1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:17.160
But I told you no.

1:03:19.360 --> 1:03:20.520
We needed the money.

1:03:30.680 --> 1:03:34.760
Not so bad, buddy,
that we needed you to disobey us.

1:03:36.600 --> 1:03:38.040
I know.

1:03:42.120 --> 1:03:44.120
I guess
it wasn't just for the money either.

1:03:46.560 --> 1:03:48.720
I wanted to be a part of Team X-Bladz.

1:03:49.480 --> 1:03:51.760

in every magazine.

we're a lot alike.

"Hi. How ya doin'? I'm Ralph Brinker.
I'm the construction foreman."

1:04:23.320 --> 1:04:26.160
I used to love saying that.
People looked up to me.

1:04:28.120 --> 1:04:29.400
Then I got injured.

1:04:30.160 --> 1:04:32.680
Suddenly, no more construction foreman.

1:04:34.240 --> 1:04:36.640
You wanna know the worst part
of being on disability?

1:04:38.280 --> 1:04:40.040
I didn't know who I was anymore.

1:04:40.880 --> 1:04:44.400
I used to define myself by my job title.

1:04:45.920 --> 1:04:47.360
But you want to know something?

1:04:49.040 --> 1:04:51.040
After being laid off for six months...

1:04:54.080 --> 1:04:55.480
I finally figured out...

1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:01.120
that "construction foreman"
is what I do...

1:05:02.120 --> 1:05:03.480
not who I am.

1:05:04.800 --> 1:05:05.920
Andy.

1:05:08.600 --> 1:05:12.480
You are defined by the company you keep

1:05:13.360 --> 1:05:15.600
and how well you keep it.

1:05:16.920 --> 1:05:19.200
Not by what you just happen to do.

1:05:21.600 --> 1:05:25.360
Now, kids who skate,
come on, California's filthy with 'em.

1:05:26.560 --> 1:05:27.840

1:05:28.920 --> 1:05:30.800

And you are a good friend.

You gonna compete?

1:06:21.160 --> 1:06:22.360
No. I don't think so.

1:06:23.040 --> 1:06:26.080
Well, if you change your mind,
let me know.

1:06:27.120 --> 1:06:29.040
I'd like to watch.

1:06:30.960 --> 1:06:33.520

-Yeah. Sounds like a lot of fun.

that no one talks like that anymore.

to having a conversation?

There's your helmet.

1:07:32.440 --> 1:07:34.160
And I'd give you back your clothes too,

1:07:34.240 --> 1:07:36.800
but I actually, like, threw 'em
in a garbage bin I saw across the street.

1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:39.760
This is about your little friend,
isn't it?

1:07:40.400 --> 1:07:41.920
You put the gravel on the road.

1:07:43.040 --> 1:07:45.120
You realize you could've killed her?

1:07:45.520 --> 1:07:47.480
Man, you are such a wuss.

1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:49.680
I'm the one who should be mad at you.

1:07:50.480 --> 1:07:52.920
You didn't even have the brains
to finish the race.

1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:54.200
Maybe not,

1:07:54.840 --> 1:07:56.640
but I do have the brains to finish this.

1:07:58.360 --> 1:07:59.360
[all] Oh!

1:07:59.440 --> 1:08:00.680
You are so dead!

No, that's not it.

1:08:13.480 --> 1:08:14.800
You know what your problem is?

with me Sunday at the championship.

We'll get it on, for sure.

1:08:39.280 --> 1:08:41.600
-You need more air.
-More air?

1:08:41.720 --> 1:08:43.040
More air.

1:08:44.800 --> 1:08:47.560
And, you, Peter, what's up
with that flat-spin 540?

1:08:47.640 --> 1:08:49.240
I've got a grandmother back in Lima.

1:08:49.320 --> 1:08:50.920
She can do a 540.

1:08:51.760 --> 1:08:53.280
What's with you today?

1:08:53.360 --> 1:08:55.840
If you got beef, why don't you
