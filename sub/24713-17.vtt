WEBVTT

00:00.417 --> 00:02.627
Andy:
<i>PREVIOUSLY ON "NYPD BLUE"...</i>

00:02.627 --> 00:05.630
DID THE NYPD DO SOMETHING
TO ANGER YOU, MR. LIPE?

00:05.630 --> 00:07.090
DRIVING WHILE IMPAIRED.

00:07.173 --> 00:08.633
THAT'S WHAT
I WAS CHARGED WITH

00:08.633 --> 00:10.927
ON APRIL 4, 1991,
WHEN IT WAS

00:10.927 --> 00:13.263
PRESCRIPTION COLD MEDICINE
I HAD TAKEN.

00:13.263 --> 00:14.931
I'M TELLING YOU
THAT YOUR FATHER IS SICK,

00:14.931 --> 00:17.100
AND HE'S IN THE HOSPITAL.
IT COULD BE WEEKS,

00:17.100 --> 00:20.603
IT COULD BE A FEW DAYS.
DID HE ASK TO SEE ME?

00:20.603 --> 00:22.022
I'M NOT GOING TO SEE HIM.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.357
MY GUYS INTERVIEWED RAY MORRISON
BEFORE HE WENT TO SURGERY.

00:24.357 --> 00:26.151
HE'S SAYING YOU BEAT HIM
FOR NOTHING.

00:26.151 --> 00:27.527
HE ASSAULTED
DETECTIVE McDOWELL

00:27.527 --> 00:29.112
BEFORE ANYONE MADE A MOVE.

00:29.112 --> 00:30.530
DID YOU REALLY NEED
FIVE DETECTIVES

00:30.530 --> 00:32.532
AND A FIRE EXTINGUISHER
TO BRING HIM DOWN?

00:32.532 --> 00:34.993
IF YOU'RE GONNA PUSH YOUR
LIFESTYLE IN MY FACE AGAIN,

00:34.993 --> 00:36.745
THEN YOU SHOULD TURN AROUND
AND LEAVE.

00:36.745 --> 00:37.996
YOU'RE IN MY PRAYERS, DAD,

00:37.996 --> 00:39.998
AND I HOPE YOU
MAKE A FULL RECOVERY.

00:39.998 --> 00:42.459
YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT ANYTHING
ELSE OTHER THAN BEING GAY?

00:50.258 --> 00:51.926
TOMMY SAID
AT THE HAUNTED HOUSE

00:51.926 --> 00:54.012
THE GHOST IS ON THE RIDE
WITH YOU,

00:54.012 --> 00:55.388
AND SOME OF THEM SING.

00:55.388 --> 00:57.682
WELL, THEY SOUND VERY TALENTED.
COMB YOUR HAIR OUT.

00:57.682 --> 00:59.601
I DON'T WANT YOU
LATE FOR SCHOOL.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.269
THEY ALSO GOT A PIRATE RIDE.

01:01.269 --> 01:04.689
THEO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP
REMINDING ME ABOUT DISNEY WORLD.

01:04.689 --> 01:07.776
I REMEMBER PROMISING THAT
TO YOU, AND I'LL STAND BY IT.

01:07.776 --> 01:09.152
BUT WHEN?

01:09.152 --> 01:11.821
WELL, MAKING PLANS TO TRAVEL
SO FAR TAKES TIME.

01:11.821 --> 01:13.281
HOW MUCH?

01:13.281 --> 01:14.532
ANOTHER WEEK OR SO.

01:14.532 --> 01:16.993
WHY DON'T YOU GO GRAB
YOUR LUNCH OUT OF THE FRIDGE?

01:16.993 --> 01:18.661
THERE'S A SPACE
ROLLER COASTER, TOO.

01:18.661 --> 01:21.039
TOMMY SAID I'M NOT
BIG ENOUGH FOR IT,

01:21.039 --> 01:22.540
BUT YOU AND CONNIE CAN GO.

01:33.134 --> 01:34.511
LISTEN, THEO,

01:34.511 --> 01:37.764
I KNOW CONNIE GOES TO A LOT
OF PLACES WITH US,

01:37.764 --> 01:40.225
BUT SHE WON'T BE COMING
TO FLORIDA.
WHY NOT?

01:40.225 --> 01:41.643
'CAUSE SHE'S GOT TO WORK.

01:41.643 --> 01:44.104
I CAN DO IT BECAUSE I'M
TAKING SOME SPECIAL TIME OFF.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.523
I WANT CONNIE TO COME.
WELL, SHE CAN'T.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.608
SHE'S BUSY.
IT'LL JUST BE YOU AND ME.

01:48.608 --> 01:49.943
SHE CAME TO THE ZOO.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.861
YEAH, BUT THAT
WAS THREE HOURS.

01:51.861 --> 01:54.864
THIS IS FOUR DAYS.
IT'S DIFFERENT.

01:54.864 --> 01:57.033
IF SHE DOESN'T COME,
I WON'T GO.

01:57.033 --> 01:58.284
THEN WE WON'T GO.

01:58.284 --> 01:59.994
FINE. HM.

01:59.994 --> 02:02.664
FINE.

02:02.664 --> 02:04.165
THEO, COME ON.

02:04.165 --> 02:05.625
LET'S JUST GO TO SCHOOL.

02:19.472 --> 02:20.890
HEY.

02:21.891 --> 02:23.810
D.O.A.'s A DAVID BULLHACK.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.270
LIVES TWO BLOCKS DOWN
ON 4th STREET.

02:25.270 --> 02:26.271
THREE IN THE CHEST.

02:26.271 --> 02:27.564
WHO CALLED IT IN?

02:27.564 --> 02:29.774
WITNESS ON THE SECOND FLOOR
HEARD SHOTS AT 5:00 A.M.,

02:29.774 --> 02:32.026
LOOKED OUT HIS WINDOW,
AND SAW A CAB TAKING OFF.

02:32.026 --> 02:33.611
WITNESS GOT THE LICENSE NUMBER.
RITA'S RUNNING IT.

02:33.611 --> 02:34.904
GYPSY CAB.

02:34.904 --> 02:36.197
YEAH.

02:36.197 --> 02:37.699
'CAUSE THERE'S NO WAY
YOU'RE GOING TO GET

02:37.699 --> 02:39.159
A YELLOW CAB
WITH A BLACK PASSENGER

02:39.159 --> 02:40.702
AT 5:00 IN THE MORNING.

02:42.245 --> 02:44.289
UH, THEO SAYS HI.

02:44.289 --> 02:45.957
YEAH?

02:45.957 --> 02:48.751
YEAH. HE'S LOBBYING
TO GO TO DISNEY WORLD.

02:48.751 --> 02:50.461
KID'S RELENTLESS.

02:50.461 --> 02:51.963
ARE YOU TAKING HIM?

02:51.963 --> 02:54.799
YEAH, I GUESS.

02:54.799 --> 02:56.384
ANYWAYS, UH...

02:57.969 --> 03:00.597
WALLET AND CASH
STILL ON HIM.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.807
CAB COMES BACK
TO A RYAN LIPE.

03:02.807 --> 03:05.810
LIPE.
HOW DO I KNOW THAT NAME?

03:05.810 --> 03:06.936
IT'S THAT GYPSY CAB GUY,

03:06.936 --> 03:08.229
THE WITNESS
ON THAT PARK SHOOTING,

03:08.229 --> 03:09.898
HAD THE BEEF WITH THE DEPARTMENT
FOR THE D.U.I.

03:09.898 --> 03:11.232
TOTAL CREEP.

03:11.232 --> 03:12.567
OH, YEAH. HIM?

03:12.567 --> 03:13.943
YOU BUILD A RAPPORT?

03:13.943 --> 03:16.362
WELL, AS MUCH AS WE COULD
WITH A 40-YEAR-OLD GUY

03:16.362 --> 03:17.697
WHO STILL LIVES
WITH HIS MOM.

03:17.697 --> 03:18.698
WE'LL TAKE IT.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.158
YEAH. WE'LL CANVASS.

03:21.701 --> 03:24.621
YOU GUYS DO ME A FAVOR,
COVER HIM BACK UP?

03:24.621 --> 03:26.331
HEY, CLARK.

03:26.331 --> 03:27.832
ORTIZ. HER HUSBAND
WHO JUST DIED --

03:27.832 --> 03:29.876
I HEARD THAT HE WAS ACTUALLY
HER EX-HUSBAND.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.461
AM I RIGHT ON THAT?

03:31.461 --> 03:33.213
THEY WERE GETTING DIVORCED.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.839
WERE THEY CLOSE?

03:34.839 --> 03:36.216
I MEAN, I GUESS. WHY?

03:36.216 --> 03:38.009
WELL, IF SHE WAS LOOKING
TO REBOUND,

03:38.009 --> 03:40.261
I WOULDN'T MIND HELPING
HER OUT WITH THAT, RIGHT?

03:40.261 --> 03:42.222
LOOK, MAYBE YOU
COULD GIVE ME A HEADS UP

03:42.222 --> 03:43.473
AS FAR AS THAT'S CONCERNED,

03:43.473 --> 03:45.433
UNLESS ONE OF YOU GUYS
IS ALREADY HITTING HER.

03:45.433 --> 03:47.227
YOU GOING TO SLIDE
YOUR WEDDING RING OFF

03:47.227 --> 03:48.811
BEFORE YOU ASK
WHAT HER SIGN IS?

03:48.811 --> 03:50.271
WHAT ARE YOU, THE DEPARTMENT
CHAPLAIN NOW?

03:50.271 --> 03:52.398
DOES SHE NEED YOU
HITTING ON HER RIGHT NOW?

03:52.398 --> 03:53.566
PROBABLY NOT.

03:53.566 --> 03:54.609
I'M JUST ASKING
HER STORY.

03:54.609 --> 03:56.402
YOU DON'T GOT TO BE
AN ASSHOLE ABOUT IT.

03:56.402 --> 03:59.239
SHE BURIED HER EX
A WEEK AGO.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.823
GO NUTS.

05:15.231 --> 05:16.816
HAVE A SEAT, MR. LIPE.

05:16.816 --> 05:19.360
YEAH, I'M JUST GONNA STAND HERE
WITH MY FINGER UP MY BUTT?

05:19.360 --> 05:21.529
ANY IDEA WHY WE'D
BRING YOU IN TODAY?

05:21.529 --> 05:22.864
HOW ABOUT WE JUST GET TO IT

05:22.864 --> 05:24.615
INSTEAD OF PLAYING
GUESSING GAMES?

05:24.615 --> 05:26.200
WHERE YOU BEEN
THIS MORNING?

05:26.200 --> 05:27.368
WORKING.

05:27.368 --> 05:28.828
DRIVING YOUR CAB?
CORRECT.

05:28.828 --> 05:30.872
YOU DRIVE BY ST. MARK'S
IN THE BOWERY?

05:30.872 --> 05:32.081
YES.

05:32.081 --> 05:33.333
WHEN WERE YOU THERE?

05:33.333 --> 05:34.834
5:03 A.M.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.878
WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE?

05:36.878 --> 05:39.130
DROPPING OFF A FARE.
WHAT DID HE LOOK LIKE?

05:39.130 --> 05:40.465
HE WAS A RABBI.

05:40.465 --> 05:42.508
WHO DO YOU THINK I WAS
DROPPING OFF AT ST. MARK'S

05:42.508 --> 05:43.593
AT 5:00 IN THE MORNING?

05:43.593 --> 05:44.969
WHAT DID HE LOOK LIKE?

05:44.969 --> 05:46.554
HE WAS A BLACK MAN.

05:46.554 --> 05:47.597
YOU TWO
HAVE A DISAGREEMENT?

05:47.597 --> 05:48.681
WE DID.
OVER?

05:48.681 --> 05:49.682
HIM WANTING MY MONEY

05:49.682 --> 05:51.601
AND ME PREFERRING
TO HOLD ON TO IT.

05:51.601 --> 05:54.062
YOU PULL A GUN?
I DID.

05:54.062 --> 05:56.272
YOU SHOOT IT?
ABSOLUTELY.

05:56.272 --> 05:59.025
BECAUSE HE WAS ROBBING YOU,
YOU'RE SAYING?

05:59.025 --> 06:00.068
THAT'S RIGHT.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.527
DID HE HAVE A WEAPON?

06:01.527 --> 06:02.695
A GUN.

06:02.695 --> 06:04.614
WE DIDN'T FIND ONE
AT THE CRIME SCENE.

06:04.614 --> 06:07.575
[ SCOFFS ]
SEE, THIS IS WHY
I DIDN'T COME FORWARD.

06:07.575 --> 06:09.077
I HAVE BEEN SCREWED
IN MY DEALINGS

06:09.077 --> 06:11.537
WITH THE NYPD, AND HERE I AM
GETTING RAILROADED AGAIN.

06:11.537 --> 06:12.663
MEANING WHAT?

06:12.663 --> 06:13.998
MEANING SOMEONE
IN YOUR DEPARTMENT

06:13.998 --> 06:15.833
WHO'S STILL TRYING
TO GET BACK AT ME

06:15.833 --> 06:17.210
FOR PROVING
IT WAS POLICE ERROR

06:17.210 --> 06:19.879
WHEN I WAS CHARGED
WITH MY D.U.I. 10 YEARS AGO

06:19.879 --> 06:21.130
SOMEHOW MAKES THAT GUY'S
GUN DISAPPEAR

06:21.130 --> 06:23.174
TO MAKE ME LOOK LIKE
I KILLED HIM FOR NO REASON

06:23.174 --> 06:24.550
SO I GET FRAMED FOR MURDER.

06:24.550 --> 06:27.845
NO OFFENSE, LIPE, BUT YOU'RE
REALLY NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE.

06:27.845 --> 06:29.597
THAT MAN HAD A GUN
IN MY FACE,

06:29.597 --> 06:31.224
DEMANDING MY MONEY.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.017
IT WAS HIM OR ME,
AND I DEFENDED MYSELF,

06:33.017 --> 06:34.769
WHICH I HAVE
A RIGHT TO DO.

06:34.769 --> 06:36.062
WHERE'S YOUR GUN NOW?

06:36.062 --> 06:38.064
MY NIGHTSTAND.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.066
ALL RIGHT, START FROM WHERE
YOU PICKED UP THIS FARE,

06:40.066 --> 06:42.068
AND RUN THE WHOLE
THING THROUGH.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.611
WHY BOTHER?

06:43.611 --> 06:45.947
THIS POLICE DEPARTMENT'S JUST
GOING TO BEND ME OVER AGAIN.

06:45.947 --> 06:48.199
ALL RIGHT, SHUT YOUR MOUTH
ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE

06:48.199 --> 06:49.659
EXCEPT WHAT HAPPENED
THIS MORNING.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.876
HOMICIDE OUTSIDE
THE CAT AND FIDDLE BAR.

06:58.876 --> 07:00.336
ON HESTER?

07:00.336 --> 07:02.463
YEAH. McDOWELL AND ORTIZ
STILL ON CANVASS?

07:02.463 --> 07:04.465
YEAH. YOU WANT THEM
TO HELP OUT ON THIS?

07:04.465 --> 07:05.883
IF THEY'RE DONE.

07:08.803 --> 07:10.304
WHAT DID YOU GET
FROM LIPE?

07:10.304 --> 07:12.140
COPPED TO IT.
CLAIMING SELF-DEFENSE.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.599
JUNIOR'S GETTING
HIS STATEMENT.

07:13.599 --> 07:15.101
BUT NO GUN ON THE D.O.A.?

07:15.101 --> 07:16.602
IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD,
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE

07:16.602 --> 07:17.937
IT GOT GLOMMED.

07:17.937 --> 07:19.272
WHERE'S LIPE'S GUN?

07:19.272 --> 07:21.149
HIS APARTMENT.
WE'LL SWING BY, PICK IT UP,

07:21.149 --> 07:22.692
DROP IT AT BALLISTICS.

07:22.692 --> 07:25.111
ALL RIGHT, LIPE STAYS
TILL HEYWOOD WEIGHS IN.
UH-HUH.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.615
AHEM.

07:29.615 --> 07:31.492
SO, UH, HOW'S
IT GOING, JOHN?

07:31.492 --> 07:33.703
FINE, DETECTIVE.

07:33.703 --> 07:35.830
ANY PROGRESS WITH YOUR DAD?

07:35.830 --> 07:37.498
NO IMPROVEMENT.
HE'S STILL VERY ILL.

07:37.498 --> 07:39.292
BUT DID YOU SEE HIM?

07:39.292 --> 07:40.543
I DID.

07:40.543 --> 07:42.420
YOU TALKED?

07:42.420 --> 07:44.088
HE'S VERY SICK,
AND JUSTIFIABLY DEPRESSED.

07:44.088 --> 07:45.465
SO NO PROGRESS?

07:45.465 --> 07:47.925
AT LEAST I GOT TO SEE HIM.

07:49.218 --> 07:52.472
IS TONY RODRIGUEZ IN?

07:52.472 --> 07:54.599
OH, GO AHEAD,
YOU CAN GO ON IN.

07:57.810 --> 07:58.811
HEY!

07:58.811 --> 08:00.521
TONY, QUé PASA, MI BROTHER?

08:00.521 --> 08:02.565
DANIEL.
MUST BE FIVE YEARS.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.400
HOW YOU BEEN KEEPING?

08:04.400 --> 08:05.401
AH, GOOD, YOU KNOW.

08:05.401 --> 08:06.944
RETIRED SEVERAL YEARS BACK.

08:06.944 --> 08:08.863
JUST STARTED UP
A DRY CLEANERS WITH MY WIFE.

08:08.863 --> 08:10.156
ENTREPRENEUR.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.282
HEY, THERE YOU GO.

08:11.282 --> 08:13.701
SO, YOU IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD?

08:13.701 --> 08:15.286
NAH, I LIVE OUT
ON THE ISLAND, TONY.

08:15.286 --> 08:17.747
YOU GO OVER THE WORK
OFF THE LATE TOUR YET?

08:17.747 --> 08:18.998
WHAT AM I LOOKING FOR?

08:18.998 --> 08:21.167
MY SON PETER
WAS IN A BAR FIGHT,

08:21.167 --> 08:22.752
GOT BLOWN
WAY OUT OF PROPORTION.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.420
WHAT'S THE STORY?

08:24.420 --> 08:26.005
THIS GUY WAS LOADED,
HE'S MOUTHING OFF,

08:26.005 --> 08:27.298
HE'S PUTTING HIS HANDS
ON WOMEN,

08:27.298 --> 08:28.549
SO PETEY TELLS HIM
TO COOL IT.

08:28.549 --> 08:30.760
THE GUY SWINGS,
NICKS PETEY'S CHIN.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.762
PETEY SWUNG BACK,
CONNECTED -- ONCE.

08:32.762 --> 08:34.597
HEY, JUST TO COOL
THE GUY OFF.

08:34.597 --> 08:35.932
THEN HE SPLIT.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.350
NEXT THING HE KNOWS,
THERE'S UNIFORM COPS

08:37.350 --> 08:38.518
KNOCKING AT HIS DOOR.

08:38.518 --> 08:39.727
DID HE GET LOCKED UP?

08:39.727 --> 08:42.063
NAH, HE DIDN'T ANSWER
THE DOOR, MAN.

08:42.063 --> 08:43.481
HE WAS TERRIFIED.

08:43.481 --> 08:44.899
WHAT'S THE COMPLAINANT SAY?

08:44.899 --> 08:46.442
IT WAS PETER WHO WAS DRUNK,

08:46.442 --> 08:48.611
AND, UNPROVOKED,
ATTACKED HIM WITH A POOL CUE.

08:48.611 --> 08:49.862
A LITTLE DISPARITY THERE.

08:49.862 --> 08:51.405
TONY, PETEY'S LIKE ME.

08:51.405 --> 08:54.367
HE'S GOT A LITTLE BIT OF A
TEMPER, BUT HE'S NOT A BAD KID.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.035
AND IF HE THROWS DOWN,
IT'S NEVER OUT OF THE BLUE,

08:56.035 --> 08:57.954
AND NOT WITH A POOL CUE.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.247
LET ME LOOK INTO IT.

08:59.247 --> 09:00.873
PERSONALLY, OR ARE YOU
GOING TO ASSIGN IT OUT?

09:00.873 --> 09:02.208
I'LL TAKE A LOOK
AT IT FIRST.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.417
YOU LOOKING TO MAKE IT
GO AWAY?

09:03.417 --> 09:04.961
I'LL TALK TO THE COMPLAINANT.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.879
MAYBE SOBER
HE'S A DIFFERENT GUY.

09:06.879 --> 09:08.881
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH
I APPRECIATE IT.

09:08.881 --> 09:12.885
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH
PETEY APPRECIATES IT.

09:12.885 --> 09:14.470
WHAT'S THIS?

09:14.470 --> 09:16.097
A GRAND FOR YOU
OR YOUR GUYS --

09:16.097 --> 09:18.099
WHOEVER HANDLES IT.
MY THANKS AHEAD OF TIME.

09:18.099 --> 09:19.642
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING, DANIEL,

09:19.642 --> 09:20.893
YOU KNOW
THAT'S NOT HOW I WORK.

09:20.893 --> 09:22.436
BUT THIS IS
BETWEEN FRIENDS.

09:22.436 --> 09:24.397
AND AS A FRIEND,
I SAID I'D LOOK INTO IT.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.856
I DIDN'T MEAN
NO DISRESPECT.

09:25.856 --> 09:27.233
FORGET IT.
I'LL BE IN TOUCH.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.818
THANKS, TONY.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.623
HEY.

09:42.623 --> 09:44.959
UH, D.O.A.'s
A TIMOTHY RICHTMAN.

09:44.959 --> 09:46.961
RADIO CAR PULLED
AROUND THE CORNER

09:46.961 --> 09:48.546
AND SAW THIS GUY
LEANING OVER HIM.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.798
THEY THOUGHT HE WAS LIFTING
THE D.O.A.'s WALLET,

09:50.798 --> 09:52.425
BUT HE SAYS RICHTMAN
GOT PUNCHED IN THE FACE

09:52.425 --> 09:53.968
BY A STRANGER
WHO WHACKED HIS HEAD.

09:53.968 --> 09:55.469
HE WAS TRYING
TO REVIVE HIM.

09:55.469 --> 09:57.138
WHO IS HE?

09:57.138 --> 09:59.890
JOE BRADY. SAYS HIM AND THE
D.O.A. ARE SORT OF FRIENDS.

09:59.890 --> 10:01.809
WE HAVEN'T TALKED TO HIM
PAST THAT.

10:01.809 --> 10:03.436
ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL TAKE HIM.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.687
UH, D.O.A.'s CELL PHONE.

10:04.687 --> 10:07.273
WE'LL START A CANVASS.

10:07.273 --> 10:09.275
DETECTIVES MEDAVOY
AND JONES.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.735
HOW YOU DOING, JOE?

10:10.735 --> 10:13.279
I'M FLIPPIN' OUT.
I MEAN, LOOK AT HIM.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.865
HE LOOKS LIKE HE COULD JUST
GET UP AND WALK AWAY.

10:15.865 --> 10:16.949
WHAT HAPPENED?

10:16.949 --> 10:18.367
I CAME FOR A DRINK,

10:18.367 --> 10:20.077
BUT THIS PLACE ISN'T OPEN
FOR SOME REASON,

10:20.077 --> 10:21.621
AND THEN TIM SHOWS,
AND WE FIGURE

10:21.621 --> 10:22.830
WE'LL FIND ANOTHER PLACE.

10:22.830 --> 10:24.248
AND THEN THIS
GIANT BLACK DUDE,

10:24.248 --> 10:26.208
HE WALKS UP AND
NAILS TIM IN THE FACE.

10:26.208 --> 10:27.543
FOR NOTHING?

10:27.543 --> 10:29.295
GUY WAS TRYING
TO GO IN THE BAR,

10:29.295 --> 10:30.963
SO TIM TELLS HIM
IT'S CLOSED,

10:30.963 --> 10:32.298
THE GUY TRIED
THE DOOR ANYWAY,

10:32.298 --> 10:33.674
AND THEN TIM SAYS,

10:33.674 --> 10:35.635
"CAN'T YOU HEAR,
YOU STUPID APE?"

10:35.635 --> 10:38.763
AND THE GUY DRILLED HIM
AND TOOK OFF.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.264
YOU DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT?

10:40.264 --> 10:42.892
THE GUY WAS MASSIVE.
I MEAN, NO WAY.

10:42.892 --> 10:45.144
ANYONE ELSE SEE IT?

10:45.144 --> 10:47.396
NO, IT WAS PRETTY EMPTY
HERE EARLIER.

10:47.396 --> 10:49.148
YOU EVER SEE THE BIG GUY
BEFORE?
NEVER.

10:49.148 --> 10:51.484
TIM SEEM TO KNOW HIM?
IT HAPPENED TOO QUICK.

10:51.484 --> 10:52.860
WELL, HOW DO YOU KNOW TIM?

10:52.860 --> 10:55.488
I SEEN HIM IN SOME BARS,
BUT JUST TO SAY HELLO.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.741
THE GUY'S A FRUIT,
BUT I JUST SAY HELLO.

10:58.741 --> 10:59.950
SO THIS IS A GAY JOINT?

10:59.950 --> 11:01.952
NO, NO, NO,
THAT'S NOT ME.

11:01.952 --> 11:03.079
I'M JUST SAYING ABOUT HIM

11:03.079 --> 11:05.164
BECAUSE MAYBE
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL.

11:05.164 --> 11:06.332
I DON'T KNOW.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.501
I'M FREAKING OUT HERE
A LITTLE.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.002
I NEVER SEEN ANYONE
KILLED BEFORE.

11:10.002 --> 11:11.545
SURE, WE UNDERSTAND.

11:11.545 --> 11:12.713
CAN I SPLIT?

11:12.713 --> 11:14.340
I REALLY NEED
TO GO HOME NOW.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.092
WE'RE GOING TO NEED YOU TO COME
DOWN TO THE STATION HOUSE

11:16.092 --> 11:18.678
WHILE WE LOOK INTO THIS
A LITTLE MORE, JOE.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.137
I TOLD YOU WHAT HAPPENED.

11:20.137 --> 11:22.098
YEAH, BUT WHEN WE GET
THIS BIG GUY IN,

11:22.098 --> 11:23.641
WE'RE GONNA NEED
YOU TO IDENTIFY HIM

11:23.641 --> 11:25.142
WHILE IT'S STILL FRESH
IN YOUR MIND.

11:25.142 --> 11:27.687
YEAH? I GUESS.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.272
I MEAN,
YOU SURE HE'S DEAD?

11:30.272 --> 11:32.149
HE LOOKS
PERFECTLY FINE TO ME.

11:32.149 --> 11:33.401
COME ON, JOE.

11:40.032 --> 11:41.158
NO EYEWITNESSES.

11:41.158 --> 11:43.202
JUST THE GUY WHO SAW
THE CAB DRIVE OFF

11:43.202 --> 11:45.162
A COUPLE OF SECONDS
AFTER THE SHOTS WERE FIRED.

11:45.162 --> 11:47.289
THIS WITNESS SEE ANYBODY
TAKE THE GUN

11:47.289 --> 11:48.332
OFF THE D.O.A.?

11:48.332 --> 11:50.334
NO, BUT HE WENT
BACK INTO THE BUILDING

11:50.334 --> 11:53.421
TO DIAL 911, SO IT COULD
HAVE GOT SWIPED IN THE INTERIM.

11:53.421 --> 11:55.339
WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME
A GUN GOT SWIPED

11:55.339 --> 11:56.799
AT A SHOOTING SCENE.

11:56.799 --> 11:58.676
BUT WHOEVER MAY HAVE STOLEN
THE GUN OFF THE D.O.A.

11:58.676 --> 11:59.885
DIDN'T STEAL HIS WALLET.

11:59.885 --> 12:01.846
IT'S EASIER TO GRAB
A GUN OFF THE PAVEMENT

12:01.846 --> 12:03.347
THAN GO THROUGH
SOMEBODY'S POCKETS.

12:03.347 --> 12:04.557
CAB DRIVER GOT A SHEET?

12:04.557 --> 12:06.684
D.W.I. 10 YEARS AGO,
WHICH HE'LL BE HAPPY

12:06.684 --> 12:08.102
TO SPEND FIVE HOURS
DESCRIBING

12:08.102 --> 12:11.063
HOW IT WAS
POLICE DEPARTMENT ERROR.
NOTHING VIOLENT, THOUGH.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.691
HE MIGHT BE GOOD FOR IT.
WE'RE JUST SAYING WE
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO HOLD HIM.

12:13.691 --> 12:15.735
Tony: D.O.A. WASN'T SHOT
IN THE BACK, SO IT WASN'T LIKE

12:15.735 --> 12:17.862
HE WAS RUNNING AWAY
AND LIPE WAS OUT OF DANGER.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.614
WHY DIDN'T THE CABBY
COME FORWARD, THOUGH?
WHY'D WE HAVE TO TRACK HIM DOWN?

12:20.614 --> 12:22.032
HIS GUN IS NOT LICENSED.
HE PANICKED.

12:22.032 --> 12:24.744
YOU GETTING THE DRIFT THAT WE
DON'T WANT TO LOCK THIS GUY UP?

12:24.744 --> 12:26.620
ARE YOU GETTING THE DRIFT
THAT I'M GONNA HAVE TO

12:26.620 --> 12:28.164
RESPOND TO MY BOSSES
WHY WE HAVEN'T MADE

12:28.164 --> 12:30.207
A SUMMARY ARREST
IN THIS CASE?

12:30.207 --> 12:32.418
THIS CABBY STEPPED UP
AND DID THE RIGHT THING

12:32.418 --> 12:34.211
ON A CASE WE HAD
A WHILE AGO

12:34.211 --> 12:35.963
INVOLVING A 3-YEAR-OLD GIRL
WHO WAS KILLED.

12:35.963 --> 12:37.965
IT'S YOUR CALL.

12:37.965 --> 12:39.925
WE KICK HIM,
IS HE GOING ANYWHERE?

12:39.925 --> 12:41.427
WE DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.804
ALL RIGHT, LET'S KICK HIM
FOR NOW AND KEEP INVESTIGATING.

12:43.804 --> 12:47.558
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL HEAD BACK OUT
AND RE-CANVASS THE CRIME SCENE.

12:58.235 --> 13:01.030
RITA?

13:01.030 --> 13:02.490
UH, ED LAUGHLIN.

13:02.490 --> 13:03.657
SURE.

13:03.657 --> 13:05.284
WE NEVER OFFICIALLY MET.

13:05.284 --> 13:06.619
HOW'S IT GOING?

13:06.619 --> 13:07.828
I JUST WANTED TO SAY

13:07.828 --> 13:09.497
HOW SORRY I AM
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.999
UH, THANK YOU.
THANKS A LOT.

13:11.999 --> 13:13.751
I RECENTLY LOST AN UNCLE

13:13.751 --> 13:15.336
WHO I WAS REALLY CLOSE
WITH, SO --

13:15.336 --> 13:17.296
I MEAN, I KNOW IT'S NOT
THE SAME THING, BUT --

13:17.296 --> 13:19.799
WELL, I APPRECIATE
THE THOUGHT.

13:19.799 --> 13:23.844
SO, UH, IF YOU EVER NEED
SOMEONE TO TALK TO

13:23.844 --> 13:26.472
WHO'S BEEN THERE,
I'M AROUND.

13:26.472 --> 13:28.098
THANKS.

13:32.186 --> 13:33.938
Clark: [ SCOFFS ]
THIS VULTURE OVER HERE,

13:33.938 --> 13:35.439
TRYING TO MOVE IN
ON ORTIZ.

13:35.439 --> 13:36.941
WHAT, I CAN'T EXPRESS
MY CONDOLENCES?

13:36.941 --> 13:39.151
Clark: WHATEVER YOU'RE
DOING, LAUGHLIN,

13:39.151 --> 13:40.611
IT'S WORKING.
SERIOUSLY.

13:40.611 --> 13:42.696
SHE DIDN'T MAKE YOU
FOR A DOUCHE BAG AT ALL.

13:42.696 --> 13:43.823
Andy: COME ON.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.825
IF YOU GOT A LITTLE
PUPPY LOVE CRUSH ON HER,

13:45.825 --> 13:47.618
JUST SAY SO, CLARK.

13:47.618 --> 13:49.036
WHAT?

13:49.036 --> 13:51.080
WHY DON'T YOU GO GIVE OUT
SOME PARKING SUMMONS,

13:51.080 --> 13:52.289
LAUGHLIN, ALL RIGHT?

13:52.289 --> 13:54.083
SOMETHING YOU CAN HANDLE.
COME ON.

14:07.638 --> 14:09.640
DID YOU FIND THE GUY
THAT HIT TIM?

14:09.640 --> 14:11.433
I'M KIND OF READY
TO HIT THE ROAD.

14:11.433 --> 14:12.643
WE'RE WORKING ON IT.

14:12.643 --> 14:14.186
IN THE MEANTIME,
IT WOULD BE A BIG HELP

14:14.186 --> 14:17.940
IF YOU COULD CLARIFY WHAT
YOUR RELATIONSHIP WAS WITH TIM.

14:17.940 --> 14:20.401
WHY?
WE'VE BEEN CALLING NUMBERS
FROM TIM'S CELL PHONE,

14:20.401 --> 14:22.903
TALKIN' TO HIS FRIENDS,
AND THEY SAY YOU'VE
BEEN HANGING OUT TOGETHER.

14:22.903 --> 14:24.738
LIKE I SAID,
I'D SEE HIM IN BARS.

14:24.738 --> 14:27.533
HE'D BE DRINKING AT THAT END,
I'M DOWN HERE.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.159
WE'D SAY HELLO.

14:29.159 --> 14:30.661
HIS FRIENDS SAY
YOU'VE BEEN TOGETHER

14:30.661 --> 14:32.621
ALL THE TIME FOR A WEEK.
WHY LIE ABOUT IT?

14:32.621 --> 14:34.331
I DIDN'T WANT YOU
THINKING I'M A HUSTLER.

14:34.331 --> 14:35.833
THAT'S NOT ME.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.960
WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT, JOE.
WE JUST WANT THE TRUTH.

14:37.960 --> 14:41.005
HE WAS BUYING DRINKS,
DINNER, AND STUFF,

14:41.005 --> 14:42.464
BUT I NEVER TOUCHED HIM.

14:42.464 --> 14:43.674
NEVER.

14:43.674 --> 14:45.134
I WOULD NEVER,
EVER DO THAT.

14:45.134 --> 14:46.802
THEN WHAT
WAS HE PAYING FOR?

14:46.802 --> 14:48.554
I USED TO BE A FIGHTER.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.347
DIAMOND JOE BRADY.

14:50.347 --> 14:52.099
HE HEARD OF ME, HE LIKED
HAVING ME AROUND.

14:52.099 --> 14:53.601
OH, TO HEAR
THE OLD WAR STORIES?

14:53.601 --> 14:55.853
I GOT A FEW.

14:55.853 --> 14:57.062
I SPARRED RAY LEONARD.

14:57.062 --> 14:58.564
SUGAR RAY?

14:58.564 --> 15:00.566
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
FOR A LIVING NOW, JOE?

15:00.566 --> 15:01.609
BETWEEN GIGS.

15:01.609 --> 15:02.943
Baldwin: WHAT ABOUT TIM?

15:02.943 --> 15:04.820
HE USED TO BE
SOME BIG BALLET DANCER.

15:04.820 --> 15:06.196
DID YOU TWO EVER ARGUE

15:06.196 --> 15:07.948
ABOUT HIM HAVING MONEY
AND YOU BEING BROKE?

15:07.948 --> 15:10.409
HE JUST BOUGHT ME
SOME DRINKS.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.828
AND THAT NEVER GRATED ON YOU,
RELYING ON SOME LITTLE FRUIT?

15:12.828 --> 15:14.955
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO GET ME TO SAY?

15:14.955 --> 15:16.457
DID YOU KILL HIM, JOE?

15:16.457 --> 15:18.500
ME? NO.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.336
NO, I TOLD YOU
WHAT HAPPENED.

15:20.336 --> 15:22.296
YOU TOLD US
A LOT OF THINGS,

15:22.296 --> 15:23.756
AND MOST TURNED OUT TO BE LIES.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.883
WE WANT TO HELP, BUT WE
CAN'T UNTIL YOU'RE HONEST.

15:25.883 --> 15:29.178
THIS GIANT BLACK GUY
PUNCHED HIM AND KILLED HIM,

15:29.178 --> 15:30.471
AND WASTING TIME WITH ME

15:30.471 --> 15:32.598
IS ONLY LETTING THAT GIANT
GET FURTHER AWAY.

15:32.598 --> 15:34.433
NOW THAT'S THE TRUTH,
SO HELP ME.

15:34.433 --> 15:35.643
HOPE SO.

15:37.561 --> 15:38.812
INSIDE.

15:38.812 --> 15:40.230
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

15:42.232 --> 15:44.735
MR. RILEY,
LIEUTENANT TONY RODRIGUEZ.

15:44.735 --> 15:47.488
I NEED TO ASK SOME QUESTIONS
ABOUT THE INCIDENT LAST NIGHT

15:47.488 --> 15:49.531
AT DUFFY'S TAVERN.

15:49.531 --> 15:51.367
UM, YEAH, OKAY,
COME IN.

15:51.367 --> 15:54.286
JUST VISITING TOWN?

15:54.286 --> 15:56.330
UH, YEAH, BUSINESS MEETING.
I'M SUPPOSED TO LEAVE TOMORROW.

15:56.330 --> 15:58.040
IS THAT GOING TO HURT
MY CASE?

15:58.040 --> 15:59.833
IT SHOULDN'T.
REGARDING YOUR CASE,

15:59.833 --> 16:01.877
UH, I NEED YOU TO CLEAR UP
SOME DISCREPANCIES

16:01.877 --> 16:04.838
BETWEEN WHAT YOU SAY HAPPENED
AND MR. VEGA'S SIDE OF IT.

16:04.838 --> 16:06.131
DISCREPANCIES?
THE GUY WAS WASTED.

16:06.131 --> 16:08.801
HE BUMPED INTO ME, AND I TOLD
HIM TO SAY, "EXCUSE ME."

16:08.801 --> 16:10.928
AND THEN HE WENT AFTER ME
WITH A POOL CUE.

16:10.928 --> 16:12.429
WHERE DID HE HIT YOU?

16:12.429 --> 16:15.015
IN THE GUT, MOSTLY.

16:15.015 --> 16:16.684
HOW MANY TIMES
DID HE STRIKE YOU?

16:16.684 --> 16:18.102
UH, I DON'T REMEMBER.

16:18.102 --> 16:19.812
DID YOU GET LOOKED AT
BY A DOCTOR?

16:19.812 --> 16:21.563
NO, I FELT ALL RIGHT
AFTER A WHILE.

16:21.563 --> 16:23.357
SO YOU WEREN'T HURT
TOO BADLY?

16:23.357 --> 16:24.775
SHOULD I HAVE SEEN A DOCTOR?

16:24.775 --> 16:26.610
I MEAN, IS THIS POINTLESS
WITHOUT THAT?

16:26.610 --> 16:28.696
I'M ASKING BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE
ALLEGING IS A FELONY ASSAULT.

16:28.696 --> 16:31.323
IF MR. VEGA IS CONVICTED,
HE'S LOOKING AT JAIL TIME.

16:31.323 --> 16:34.201
WHAT, SO I SHOULDN'T DO IT?
YOU THINK JAIL TIME
IS WARRANTED?

16:34.201 --> 16:35.869
ARE YOU ASKING ME
TO DROP THE CASE?

16:35.869 --> 16:38.205
I'M ASKING YOU
TO WEIGH THE CRIME

16:38.205 --> 16:40.082
VERSUS A POTENTIAL
PUNISHMENT.

16:40.082 --> 16:42.084
BEING COMPLETELY HONEST,
MR. RILEY,

16:42.084 --> 16:44.962
I KNOW THIS KID'S FATHER,
AND THEY'RE A DECENT FAMILY.

16:44.962 --> 16:46.213
OH. OKAY.

16:46.213 --> 16:48.465
IF THIS IS A CASE
MORE ABOUT A BRUISED EGO

16:48.465 --> 16:50.134
THAN REAL PHYSICAL PAIN,

16:50.134 --> 16:52.261
I'D APPRECIATE YOU TAKING
THAT INTO CONSIDERATION.

16:52.261 --> 16:54.263
WELL, I TELL YOU, UH,

16:54.263 --> 16:57.683
A LITTLE FINANCIAL CONSIDERATION
MIGHT MAKE THIS GO AWAY.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.435
THAT'S NOT ON THE TABLE.

16:59.435 --> 17:01.478
WELL, IF YOU'RE
FRIENDS WITH THE GUY,

17:01.478 --> 17:03.439
MAYBE YOU COULD SEE
THAT IT GETS ON THE TABLE.

17:03.439 --> 17:05.899
YOU CAN MAKE IT
WORTH YOUR WHILE, TOO.

17:05.899 --> 17:07.943
MR. RILEY, MY DETECTIVES
WILL BE IN TOUCH.

17:15.951 --> 17:17.161
HEY.

17:17.161 --> 17:19.538
HEY. WHAT'S UP WITH LIPE?

17:19.538 --> 17:21.540
UH, HE'S SAYING
IT'S SELF-DEFENSE.

17:21.540 --> 17:24.418
WE'RE LOOKING INTO IT.

17:24.418 --> 17:30.007
BOY, THIS WHOLE DISNEY WORLD
THING -- WHAT A HEADACHE.

17:30.007 --> 17:32.009
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO?

17:32.009 --> 17:34.470
IT'S JUST
EVERY OTHER DAMN THING.

17:34.470 --> 17:36.597
YOU'LL HAVE FUN.

17:36.597 --> 17:38.140
WHAT A HEADACHE.

17:42.269 --> 17:44.605
ANDY, IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO TELL ME

17:44.605 --> 17:46.398
ABOUT DISNEY WORLD
AND/OR THEO?

17:46.398 --> 17:50.652
NO, IT'S JUST THEO
WANTS YOU TO GO, SO...

17:50.652 --> 17:52.863
DO YOU WANT ME TO GO?

17:52.863 --> 17:54.364
TO DISNEY WORLD?

17:54.364 --> 17:56.366
I HAVEN'T EVEN
THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

17:56.366 --> 17:58.911
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT?
YOU WANT TO GO?

17:58.911 --> 18:01.288
IF I WAS ASKED.

18:01.288 --> 18:03.165
WELL, WE'D DEFINITELY
HAVE SEPARATE ROOMS.

18:03.165 --> 18:05.000
I DON'T WANT YOU THINKING --
I MEAN, UH,

18:05.000 --> 18:07.211
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'D
BE GOING AWAY TOGETHER.

18:07.211 --> 18:09.129
I'D LOVE TO GO. WHEN?

18:09.129 --> 18:11.632
WE'RE STILL WORKING THAT OUT.
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

18:11.632 --> 18:12.758
SOUNDS GREAT.

18:17.179 --> 18:19.348
CONNIE, WE FINALLY GOT
A HOLD OF THE OWNER

18:19.348 --> 18:21.558
OF THE CAT AND FIDDLE.
TURNS OUT HE ACTUALLY DOES

18:21.558 --> 18:23.811
HAVE A REGULAR
WHO'S A 300-POUND BLACK GUY.

18:23.811 --> 18:25.562
OWNER SAID THE GUY'S NAME
IS CHESTER DODD.

18:25.562 --> 18:28.398
WE'RE GOING
TO GRAB HIM UP.
KEEP THE BOXER
IN THE POKEY?

18:28.398 --> 18:30.400
YEAH, TILL WE
TALK TO THIS GUY.

18:32.569 --> 18:35.030
WHERE'S THE LIEUTENANT?

18:35.030 --> 18:36.865
LOST TIME.
HE DIDN'T SAY.

18:36.865 --> 18:39.701
UH-HUH, AND YOU'RE 100%
ON ALL THIS?

18:39.701 --> 18:42.412
OKAY. THANKS.

18:42.412 --> 18:43.831
WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:43.831 --> 18:46.750
BALLISTICS RAN THE GUN
RYAN LIPE USED THIS MORNING.

18:46.750 --> 18:49.211
IT COMES BACK, THERE'S TWO
OTHER BODIES ON IT.

18:49.211 --> 18:50.796
FROM WHEN?
BOTH FROM LAST MONTH.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.131
WHO WERE THE D.O.A.s?

18:52.131 --> 18:54.758
BLACK MALES -- ONE AT 2:00 A.M.
THE OTHER AT 4:00 A.M.

18:54.758 --> 18:56.301
BOTH IN HARLEM,
BOTH MYSTERIES.

18:56.301 --> 18:58.720
WERE THEY ARMED?
THE FIRST ONE WAS,
NOT THE SECOND.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.597
YOU KICKED LIPE
ALREADY, RIGHT?

19:00.597 --> 19:02.599
YEAH, THAT TWITCHY
LITTLE TROLL.

19:02.599 --> 19:05.144
WELL, I'LL SEND FOR THE FOLDERS
ON THESE TWO HOMICIDES,

19:05.144 --> 19:08.272
WHILE YOU GUYS
GRAB HIM UP.
ALL RIGHT.

19:12.568 --> 19:13.944
HEY.

19:13.944 --> 19:15.237
HI.

19:15.237 --> 19:16.697
DO YOU HAVE TIME
FOR A COFFEE?

19:16.697 --> 19:19.908
I-I DON'T. I'M SWAMPED.
UM, LET ME CALL YOU LATER.

19:19.908 --> 19:21.869
THAT'S WHAT YOU
SAID YESTERDAY.

19:21.869 --> 19:24.288
UH, I'M REALLY BUSY,
DELIA. I'M SORRY.

19:24.288 --> 19:27.624
DAD WANTED ME TO TELL YOU
HE'D LIKE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

19:27.624 --> 19:28.834
THIS TIME TO TALK.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.043
HE SAID PLENTY
LAST WEEK.

19:30.043 --> 19:32.379
I GOT THE FEELING
HE REGRETTED WHAT HAPPENED.

19:32.379 --> 19:35.424
I CAN'T DO THIS NOW.
THERE'S TOO MUCH GOING ON.

19:35.424 --> 19:37.885
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.
OKAY.

19:37.885 --> 19:39.178
I'M SORRY.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.721
I AM, TOO.

20:05.162 --> 20:06.246
SIT DOWN.

20:07.748 --> 20:10.292
LET ME GUESS.

20:10.292 --> 20:13.003
THE GUN WAS NEVER FOUND,
SO I'M GETTING CHARGED

20:13.003 --> 20:15.297
WITH A MURDER
I DIDN'T COMMIT. CLOSE?

20:15.297 --> 20:17.633
IS THIS THE FIRST TIME
YOU USE YOUR GUN

20:17.633 --> 20:19.760
TO WORK OUT A PROBLEM
WITH A FARE?

20:19.760 --> 20:23.263
YES. WHERE'S THIS GOING?

20:23.263 --> 20:25.599
YOUR GUN WAS USED
IN TWO OTHER SHOOTINGS, LIPE.

20:25.599 --> 20:27.893
OH, THIS IS --

20:27.893 --> 20:29.269
I --

20:29.269 --> 20:31.939
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
WELL, ACTUALLY, I DO BELIEVE IT.

20:31.939 --> 20:34.483
TWO SHOOTINGS WITH YOUR GUN
THE LAST TWO MONTHS.

20:34.483 --> 20:36.985
WERE THEY TRYING TO ROB YOU
LIKE THE GUY THIS MORNING?

20:36.985 --> 20:38.612
THIS IS BEYOND
MY WILDEST IMAGININGS,

20:38.612 --> 20:40.697
THAT THE NYPD WOULD STOOP
TO PUT THREE MURDERS ON ME!

20:40.697 --> 20:42.574
MAY YOU ALL GO TO HELL!

20:42.574 --> 20:45.410
QUIT TAP-DANCING
AND TELL US WHAT HAPPENED, LIPE.

20:45.410 --> 20:46.954
I KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT OTHER SHOOTINGS,

20:46.954 --> 20:48.705
AND YOU WILL STOP
CALLING ME LIPE,

20:48.705 --> 20:51.124
LIKE WE'RE BUDDIES
ON THE SAME SOFTBALL TEAM

20:51.124 --> 20:53.502
AND YOU'RE TRYING TO SNAP MY ASS
WITH YOUR TOWEL

20:53.502 --> 20:54.795
IN THE SHOWERS OR SOMETHING.

20:54.795 --> 20:56.797
YOU WANT TO FRAME ME?
FRAME ME.

20:56.797 --> 20:58.799
BUT YOU WILL NOT TAKE
MY DIGNITY.

20:58.799 --> 21:00.467
YOU KEEP DICKING
AROUND WITH US,

21:00.467 --> 21:02.928
YOUR DIGNITY IS THE FIRST
OF ABOUT 10 THINGS

21:02.928 --> 21:04.221
I'LL KNOCK OUT OF YOU!

21:04.221 --> 21:05.931
LIPE!

21:05.931 --> 21:07.849
I BOUGHT THE GUN
OFF A FARE!

21:07.849 --> 21:08.850
A FARE.

21:08.850 --> 21:10.686
YES! A WHITE GUY.

21:10.686 --> 21:12.229
A COMPLETE STRANGER,

21:12.229 --> 21:14.564
YET HE TOOK THE TIME
TO TALK TO ME

21:14.564 --> 21:17.025
AND EXPRESS CONCERN
AND INTEREST AND COMPASSION

21:17.025 --> 21:19.736
INSTEAD OF ALL THE SELF-ABSORBED
HIGH-AND-MIGHTYS

21:19.736 --> 21:21.029
WHO TREAT ME LIKE A ROBOT.

21:21.029 --> 21:22.531
WHEN WAS THIS?
TWO DAYS AGO.

21:22.531 --> 21:25.200
AND WHEN THE CONVERSATION TURNED
TO HOW I HAD BEEN ROBBED

21:25.200 --> 21:27.369
AND BEATEN RECENTLY,
HE OFFERED A SOLUTION

21:27.369 --> 21:29.329
IN THE FORM OF A HANDGUN
WHICH I BOUGHT.

21:29.329 --> 21:30.998
AND I'M THANKFUL I DID.

21:30.998 --> 21:32.958
YOU SPIN A PRETTY GOOD YARN
THERE, LIPE.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.209
IT'S THE TRUTH!
REMEMBER THE TRUTH,

21:34.209 --> 21:36.128
OR HAVE YOU BEEN ON THE NYPD
TOO LONG?

21:36.128 --> 21:39.631
GO AHEAD AND FINISH YOUR TALE
ABOUT THIS, UH, MYSTERY MAN.

21:39.631 --> 21:42.301
A MYSTERY MAN WHO CARED,
WHO TURNED OUT TO BE MY SAVIOR.

21:42.301 --> 21:45.595
WHERE DID YOU
DROP THIS GUY OFF?

21:45.595 --> 21:47.931
I'LL TELL YOU,
BUT I WANT IT ON RECORD

21:47.931 --> 21:50.309
THAT IT DOESN'T SIT WELL
GIVING THIS MAN UP.

21:50.309 --> 21:53.103
NOTED. WHERE'D YOU
DROP HIM OFF?

21:53.103 --> 21:55.063
AT 312 EAST 84th STREET.

21:55.063 --> 21:56.732
I ASSUME HE LIVED
IN THE BUILDING.

21:56.732 --> 21:58.900
HE HAD A BOSTON ACCENT.
MAY I GO NOW?

21:58.900 --> 22:01.778
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE
UNTIL WE VERIFY YOUR STORY.

22:01.778 --> 22:04.031
DESCRIBE THIS GUY.

22:04.031 --> 22:06.533
SO, TONY, I'M ASSUMING
YOU GOT GOOD NEWS.

22:06.533 --> 22:10.620
WHERE'D YOU GET THE IDEA
TO THROW MONEY MY WAY?

22:10.620 --> 22:12.331
WELL, I'M MAKING
A FEW BUCKS, MAN.

22:12.331 --> 22:13.915
I JUST WANTED
TO BE THANKFUL.

22:13.915 --> 22:15.917
'CAUSE THE COMPLAINANT
IN YOUR SON'S CASE

22:15.917 --> 22:18.920
WAS LOOKING FOR A PAYOUT
AND OFFERED TO CUT ME IN.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.672
AND?
AND WHAT, DANIEL?

22:20.672 --> 22:23.550
AND I'M FINE WITH IT
IF YOU ARE.

22:23.550 --> 22:26.678
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

22:26.678 --> 22:28.388
I'M SORRY, TONY.

22:28.388 --> 22:29.681
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

22:29.681 --> 22:32.059
YOU THINK I WOULD'VE DONE IT
IF I HAD A CHOICE!

22:32.059 --> 22:33.852
WHO PUT YOU UP TO THIS?

22:33.852 --> 22:35.645
YOU'RE GOING
TO TELL ME NOW!

22:35.645 --> 22:37.647
TONY, TONY, I'M WORKING
SOMETHING OFF, MAN.

22:37.647 --> 22:39.399
I CAN'T GO TO JAIL!

22:39.399 --> 22:40.734
SON OF A BITCH!

22:40.734 --> 22:42.778
BUT I KNEW THEY COULDN'T
NAIL YOU, MAN.

22:42.778 --> 22:44.529
I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T
TAKE MONEY!

22:44.529 --> 22:47.366
YOU THINK THAT'S GOING
TO MATTER, DANIEL?
I'M SORRY.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.910
BACK AWAY, LIEUTENANT.
LET'S GO, VEGA.

22:49.910 --> 22:51.578
I'M SORRY, TONY.

22:51.578 --> 22:56.124
YOU'RE UNDER SUSPENSION.
SHIELD AND GUN.

22:56.124 --> 22:57.959
IT'S OKAY.

23:18.563 --> 23:22.109
YOUR DELEGATE
WILL BE HERE IN A MINUTE.

23:25.570 --> 23:28.323
CAN'T SAY THAT I'M NOT
A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED, TONY.

23:28.323 --> 23:29.866
I'D WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
THE OPPOSITE, CAPTAIN.

23:29.866 --> 23:31.159
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

23:31.159 --> 23:32.369
IF SOMEONE
DIDN'T KNOW BETTER,

23:32.369 --> 23:34.246
THEY MIGHT THINK
THIS WAS A NO-WIN SETUP.

23:34.246 --> 23:36.248
HAVEN'T YOU EVER HEARD
OF AN INTEGRITY TEST?

23:36.248 --> 23:38.500
THIS PLAYED OUT MORE LIKE
A PERSONAL VENDETTA.

23:38.500 --> 23:42.003
OH. SO YOU FAIL TO REPORT
A BRIBE, AND IT'S MY FAULT.

23:42.003 --> 23:44.256
I'VE KNOWN DANIEL VEGA
15 YEARS.

23:44.256 --> 23:47.342
HE WAS MY FRIEND.
HE CAME TO ME TO HELP HIS SON.

23:47.342 --> 23:49.469
LIEUTENANT, DID DANIEL VEGA
TRY TO BRIBE YOU,

23:49.469 --> 23:50.929
AND DID YOU FAIL
TO REPORT IT?

23:50.929 --> 23:53.265
I DID 14 YEARS
UNDERCOVER, CAPTAIN.

23:53.265 --> 23:55.434
I'VE WORKED
MONEY LAUNDERING CASES

23:55.434 --> 23:57.436
INVOLVING TENS OF MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS --

23:57.436 --> 23:59.396
DRUG CASES
WHERE I PERSONALLY HANDLED

23:59.396 --> 24:01.356
TRASH BAGS FULL OF CASH --

24:01.356 --> 24:04.651
AND NEVER ONCE
WAS MY INTEGRITY
CALLED INTO QUESTION.

24:04.651 --> 24:06.528
LIEUTENANT, DID YOU
OR DID YOU NOT FAIL TO REPORT

24:06.528 --> 24:07.612
THE BRIBE ATTEMPT?

24:07.612 --> 24:09.448
IS THIS WHAT YOU
WASTE YOUR TIME ON?

24:09.448 --> 24:11.116
YOU ACTUALLY CALL THIS
CORRUPTION?

24:11.116 --> 24:13.326
I DO. THE DEPARTMENT DOES,
THE PATROL GUY DOES.

24:13.326 --> 24:16.413
SO I'LL ASK YOU AGAIN --
YOU HAVE THE TAPE.
YOU KNOW THE ANSWER.

24:16.413 --> 24:18.832
IN MY REPORT, I'LL JUST PUT DOWN
THAT YOU FAILED TO RESPOND.

24:18.832 --> 24:21.293
CAN WE GET THIS DONE WITH?
WE GOT TWO HOMICIDES.

24:21.293 --> 24:22.419
I NEED TO GET BACK.

24:22.419 --> 24:25.797
BUT YOU GOT NOTHING
TO GET BACK TO, LIEUTENANT.

24:25.797 --> 24:28.049
YOU'VE BEEN RELIEVED
OF YOUR COMMAND.

24:28.049 --> 24:30.927
YOU'RE FREE TO GO, CAPTAIN.

24:36.308 --> 24:40.228
SO WHAT'S UP? THIS IS
CUTTING INTO MY SLEEP TIME.

24:40.228 --> 24:42.105
YOU A NIGHT OWL?

24:42.105 --> 24:43.982
BOUNCER AT THE LIMELIGHT.

24:43.982 --> 24:46.776
WHERE WERE YOU
AROUND 9:00 THIS MORNING?

24:46.776 --> 24:48.111
HOME.

24:48.111 --> 24:50.572
YOU HAPPEN BY HESTER STREET
ON YOUR WAY HOME,

24:50.572 --> 24:52.699
MAYBE PASS BY
THE CAT AND FIDDLE BAR?

24:52.699 --> 24:55.660
WHY?
WHY DO YOU THINK,
CHESTER?

24:55.660 --> 24:58.330
OH, YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.373
TELL US WHAT HAPPENED.

25:00.373 --> 25:02.501
THAT LITTLE BITCH
CALLED ME AN APE,

25:02.501 --> 25:04.794
WHICH IS STONE RACIST,
AND I WOULDN'T TAKE IT.

25:04.794 --> 25:06.213
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

25:06.213 --> 25:07.964
IT WOULD DEPEND
ON MY MOOD.

25:07.964 --> 25:10.592
YEAH, WELL, I WORKED ALL NIGHT.
I GOT IN TWO FIGHTS

25:10.592 --> 25:13.094
WITH A COUPLE OF GOOMBAHS,
AND I WASN'T IN THE MOOD

25:13.094 --> 25:15.013
TO BE CALLED AN APE --
A STUPID APE.

25:15.013 --> 25:16.181
YEAH, SO WHAT'D YOU DO?

25:16.181 --> 25:18.600
I GAVE HIM A SMACK --
A LITTLE SMACK --

25:18.600 --> 25:20.936
JUST TO SHUT HIM UP.
THERE WAS NO ASSAULT.

25:20.936 --> 25:22.771
HOW HARD
DID HE HIT THE GROUND?

25:22.771 --> 25:24.105
HE DIDN'T HIT THE GROUND.

25:24.105 --> 25:25.649
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?

25:25.649 --> 25:27.234
I WALKED AWAY.
I WENT HOME.

25:27.234 --> 25:29.319
END OF A BAD NIGHT.

25:29.319 --> 25:32.572
YOU NOTICE ANYONE ELSE AROUND
WHEN YOU HIT HIM, CHESTER?

25:32.572 --> 25:34.533
HIS BOYFRIEND WAS THERE.

25:34.533 --> 25:37.369
YEAH, WELL, THAT BOYFRIEND
SAYS THAT YOU HIT HIM HARDER

25:37.369 --> 25:39.120
THAN A LITTLE SMACK.
IT'S A LIE.

25:39.120 --> 25:41.081
WELL, WE'RE INCLINED
TO BELIEVE HIM

25:41.081 --> 25:44.042
SEEING HOW THE GUY YOU HIT
IS IN THE MORGUE RIGHT NOW.

25:44.042 --> 25:45.794
LIKE HE'S DEAD?

25:45.794 --> 25:47.462
THE KEY TO THIS, CHESTER,

25:47.462 --> 25:49.839
IS TO PRESENT YOURSELF
IN A SYMPATHETIC STATE OF MIND.

25:49.839 --> 25:51.508
TO WHO?
A JUDGE.

25:51.508 --> 25:52.509
A JUDGE?

25:52.509 --> 25:54.553
WITH GUYS IN YOUR FACE
ALL NIGHT,

25:54.553 --> 25:56.888
THIS ONE WAS MORE THAN YOU
COULD TAKE, AND YOU SNAPPED.

25:56.888 --> 25:58.765
IT WAS AN OPEN HAND,
LIKE A SHOVE.

25:58.765 --> 26:00.600
IT WON'T MATTER HOW
SYMPATHETIC YOUR STORY IS

26:00.600 --> 26:02.602
IF YOU KEEP LYING.

26:02.602 --> 26:05.397
WHEN I WALKED AWAY
FROM THAT BITCH, HE WAS ALIVE --

26:05.397 --> 26:07.107
SCREAMING AT HIS BOYFRIEND.

26:07.107 --> 26:08.900
I COULD HEAR IT
A BLOCK AWAY.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.819
WHAT WAS HE SCREAMING ABOUT?

26:10.819 --> 26:12.529
I DON'T KNOW. BITCH TALK.

26:12.529 --> 26:14.614
ALL I KNOW IS,
I DIDN'T KILL HIM.

26:14.614 --> 26:16.700
ARE WE DONE?

26:16.700 --> 26:18.785
OH, NO, NOT QUITE.

26:18.785 --> 26:21.830
YOU'RE STICKING AROUND.

26:21.830 --> 26:23.456
[ SCOFFS ]

26:25.917 --> 26:27.460
[ SIGHS ]

26:28.962 --> 26:30.839
AND WE GOT NO IDEA
WHO THAT GUY WAS

26:30.839 --> 26:32.048
THE BOSS WAS TALKING TO?

26:32.048 --> 26:34.134
THE LIEUTENANT KNEW HIM
AND WAVED HIM IN,

26:34.134 --> 26:35.468
SO HE DIDN'T GIVE HIS NAME.

26:35.468 --> 26:36.970
YOU KNOW WHAT?
FROM NOW ON,

26:36.970 --> 26:38.722
WHEN PEOPLE COME
IN THIS PLACE,

26:38.722 --> 26:41.099
GET THEIR NAMES, HAVE THEM
SIGN IN OR SOMETHING.

26:41.099 --> 26:44.436
PEOPLE WALTZING IN AND OUT
OF HERE LIKE A HOTEL LOBBY.

26:48.398 --> 26:51.151
THAT WAS A WOMAN WHO LIVES
ACROSS FROM THE CAT AND FIDDLE.

26:51.151 --> 26:54.571
FOUND OUR CARD UNDER HER DOOR,
SAYS SHE HAS INFORMATION.

26:54.571 --> 26:57.532
LET'S TELL GREG AND BALDWIN
WHAT WE GOT, THEN HEAD OUT.

27:02.162 --> 27:04.664
AHEM. THAT BUILDING
WHERE LIPE SAYS

27:04.664 --> 27:07.834
HE DROPPED OFF THE GUY
WHO SOLD HIM THE GUN --

27:07.834 --> 27:10.378
THE OWNER'S FAXING OVER
A TENANTS' LIST.

27:10.378 --> 27:12.130
NO WORD ON THE BOSS?

27:12.130 --> 27:13.173
NOPE.

27:13.173 --> 27:14.466
WE STILL DON'T KNOW

27:14.466 --> 27:16.593
WHO THE GUY WAS
HE WAS TALKING TO?

27:16.593 --> 27:19.554
NO ONE KNOWS ANYTHING.

27:19.554 --> 27:22.098
OKAY. WELL, ONE OF THOSE
HOMICIDES TIED TO LIPE'S GUN --

27:22.098 --> 27:23.850
THE ONE FROM TWO WEEKS AGO --

27:23.850 --> 27:26.186
THERE'S A WITNESS.
AT HER WORK UP IN HARLEM,

27:26.186 --> 27:28.188
SHE TYPED A STATEMENT
THAT WASN'T IN THE FOLDER

27:28.188 --> 27:29.522
WE GOT FROM THE CATCHING
DETECTIVE.

27:29.522 --> 27:30.899
GO AHEAD AND TAKE IT.

27:30.899 --> 27:34.569
I GOT TO FIND OUT WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE.
ALL RIGHT.

27:43.578 --> 27:45.872
WELL, THE CAT AND FIDDLE
IS RIGHT THERE,

27:45.872 --> 27:49.292
AND THIS IS MY SEAT,
SO I GOT A PRETTY GOOD VIEW.

27:49.292 --> 27:51.628
TELL US WHAT YOU SAW
THIS MORNING.

27:51.628 --> 27:55.131
WELL, THESE TWO FELLAS ARE
STANDING AT THE FIDDLE DOOR,

27:55.131 --> 27:57.884
WHICH IS USUALLY OPEN.
TODAY, I GUESS NOT.

27:57.884 --> 28:00.428
AND THIS THIRD GUY --
A LARGE BLACK MAN --

28:00.428 --> 28:03.223
HE COMES UP ON THEM.
THEY TALK A LITTLE,

28:03.223 --> 28:04.891
AND THEN THE BLACK GUY --

28:04.891 --> 28:07.894
HE CRACKS ONE
OF THE OTHER GUYS
IN THE FACE.

28:07.894 --> 28:10.063
DID THE GUY JUST TAKE IT?
DID HE STRIKE BACK?

28:10.063 --> 28:11.064
DID HE FALL DOWN?

28:11.064 --> 28:13.274
NO, HE JUST STOOD THERE,
STUNNED.

28:13.274 --> 28:16.361
OH, CAN YOU PASS THAT, KID?

28:16.361 --> 28:19.447
HOLD OFF A SECOND,
MRS. SEWALL.

28:19.447 --> 28:21.616
TELL US WHAT
HAPPENED NEXT.

28:21.616 --> 28:23.410
THE BLACK FELLOW
WALKED AWAY,

28:23.410 --> 28:25.495
AND THE ONE
THAT GOT HIT

28:25.495 --> 28:26.996
STARTED SCREAMING
AT HIS FRIEND.

28:26.996 --> 28:28.957
SCREAMING ABOUT WHAT?

28:28.957 --> 28:31.000
I COULDN'T HEAR.
ONE JUST SCREAMED

28:31.000 --> 28:34.504
UNTIL HIS FRIEND HIT HIM
IN THE FACE AND DROPPED HIM.

28:34.504 --> 28:36.881
AND YOU WERE HERE
ALL MORNING?

28:36.881 --> 28:39.759
YEAH, I DON'T GO OUT.
I GOT A BAD HIP.

28:39.759 --> 28:42.178
CAN I HAVE IT,
PLEASE?

28:42.178 --> 28:43.555
WE CAN'T HAVE YOU
DRINKING NOW.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.432
WE NEED YOU TO COME
TO THE STATION HOUSE

28:45.432 --> 28:47.183
AND GIVE A STATEMENT
TELLING WHAT YOU SAW.

28:47.183 --> 28:48.893
NO. NUH-UNH.
I DON'T LEAVE THE HOUSE.

28:48.893 --> 28:50.770
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO.
THIS IS A MURDER CASE.

28:50.770 --> 28:52.480
FORGET IT THEN.
FORGET I SAID ANYTHING.

28:52.480 --> 28:53.815
WE CAN'T DO THAT.

28:53.815 --> 28:56.234
YOU TAKE ME OUT OF THERE,
I'LL START SCREAMING.

28:56.234 --> 28:58.403
I HAVEN'T BEEN OUTSIDE
IN FOUR YEARS.

28:58.403 --> 29:02.073
I'M NOT GOING!
CAN I HAVE IT, PLEASE?

29:05.618 --> 29:07.537
WE'LL LET OURSELVES OUT.

29:15.420 --> 29:17.172
HONEY, I WROTE
EVERYTHING DOWN.

29:17.172 --> 29:18.173
VERY THOROUGH.

29:18.173 --> 29:20.300
SOON AS I GOT TO WORK
THE NEXT DAY.

29:20.300 --> 29:21.551
YOU DID A GREAT JOB.

29:21.551 --> 29:23.928
SO THEY STILL HAVEN'T
FOUND WHO SHOT THAT MAN?

29:23.928 --> 29:25.346
IT'S AN ONGOING
INVESTIGATION.

29:25.346 --> 29:26.306
MM.

29:33.646 --> 29:35.231
MM-HMM.

29:37.484 --> 29:39.611
CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

29:39.611 --> 29:41.863
HOW MUCH DOES A COP
START OFF MAKING, ROUGHLY?

29:41.863 --> 29:43.490
28,000.

29:43.490 --> 29:46.367
MM. 'CAUSE I WAS THINKING
ABOUT MAYBE TAKING THE TEST,

29:46.367 --> 29:48.161
THEY HAVE GOOD
HEALTH BENEFITS, TOO, RIGHT?

29:48.161 --> 29:49.704
'CAUSE I DON'T GET
HEALTH BENEFITS HERE.

29:49.704 --> 29:51.164
NO, HUH?
MNH-MNH.

29:51.164 --> 29:52.999
THE, UH, WHAT DO YOU
CALL IT -- ACADEMY.

29:52.999 --> 29:54.834
IS THAT LIKE BOOT CAMP
OR SOMETHING?

29:54.834 --> 29:58.338
YOU SAW A GYPSY CAB DRIVING OFF
AFTER YOU HEARD THE SHOTS?

29:58.338 --> 30:00.465
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. I REMEMBER
'CAUSE YOU DON'T SEE

30:00.465 --> 30:03.343
A LOT OF WHITE PEOPLE UP
ON 145th STREET AT 2:00 A.M.

30:03.343 --> 30:04.636
CAN I TAKE THIS WITH ME?

30:04.636 --> 30:05.887
SURE.

30:05.887 --> 30:08.014
OKAY.

30:09.599 --> 30:10.809
IS THAT YOU
ON THE BEACH?

30:10.809 --> 30:13.228
OOH, YEAH, ME
AND MY SISTER IN JAMAICA.

30:13.228 --> 30:15.647
DID YOU GET THE TRIP COMPED
THROUGH YOUR WORK HERE?
YEAH.

30:15.647 --> 30:18.274
STAY A TRAVEL AGENT.
TRUST ME.

30:18.274 --> 30:20.568
THANKS FOR THE HELP.

30:29.494 --> 30:30.662
WHAT'S GOING ON, LIEU?

30:30.662 --> 30:33.748
IAB'S BROUGHT
A BEEF AGAINST ME.

30:33.748 --> 30:35.834
WHO'S BEHIND IT?
THE NEW GUY -- THAT FRAKER?

30:35.834 --> 30:37.085
THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

30:37.085 --> 30:38.795
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS
THERE'S NO MERIT TO IT.

30:38.795 --> 30:40.129
WHAT ARE THEY SAYING?

30:40.129 --> 30:42.298
I CAN'T GO INTO DETAILS.
I JUST WANT YOU TO TRUST

30:42.298 --> 30:43.633
THAT I DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING WRONG.

30:43.633 --> 30:44.968
YOU WORKING IT OUT
AT YOUR DESK?

30:44.968 --> 30:46.636
I'VE BEEN REASSIGNED
TO THE BOROUGH.

30:46.636 --> 30:48.304
I'M SURE THEY'LL BE
SENDING A REPLACEMENT.

30:48.304 --> 30:49.889
THEY DIDN'T SAY WHEN.

30:49.889 --> 30:51.683
BUT JUST TEMPORARY.

30:51.683 --> 30:54.936
I WAS TOLD TO CLEAR OUT.
THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY FOR NOW.

31:00.817 --> 31:02.402
WHAT WAS HIS STORY --

31:02.402 --> 31:03.736
THAT FRIEND OF YOURS?

31:03.736 --> 31:05.363
IT'S A MERITLESS BEEF.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

31:05.363 --> 31:06.531
WHY YOU?

31:06.531 --> 31:08.366
I DON'T KNOW, ANDY.

31:08.366 --> 31:09.742
JUST WORK YOUR CASE.

31:09.742 --> 31:11.536
SO EITHER
THIS FRAKER IS A LUNATIC

31:11.536 --> 31:13.538
OR HE'S GOT SOMETHING PERSONAL
AGAINST YOU.

31:13.538 --> 31:15.874
FOR WHAT? I NEVER MET FRAKER
BEFORE TWO WEEKS AGO.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.083
IT'S GOT
TO BE SOMETHING.

31:17.083 --> 31:19.878
ANDY, I NEED YOU
TO KEEP YOUR HEAD.

31:19.878 --> 31:22.422
IF I'M GOING, YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO HOLD DOWN THE OFFICE.

31:22.422 --> 31:24.757
HEY, DON'T START DIGGING
YOUR GRAVE, ALL RIGHT?

31:24.757 --> 31:26.301
IF IT'S MERITLESS,
IT'LL GO AWAY.

31:26.301 --> 31:28.261
IF IAB WANTS MY HIDE,
THEY'LL GET IT.

31:28.261 --> 31:30.013
WORK YOUR CASE, ANDY.

31:30.013 --> 31:32.432
I'LL BE CHECKING IN.

31:32.432 --> 31:33.600
IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

31:33.600 --> 31:34.559
YEAH.

31:50.241 --> 31:51.242
SO?

31:51.242 --> 31:53.786
SO WE HIT A SNAG, JOE.

31:53.786 --> 31:55.246
WE TALKED
TO THE BIG BLACK GUY

31:55.246 --> 31:56.497
THAT YOU SAID KILLED TIM.

31:56.497 --> 31:58.499
HE SAYS HE ONLY GAVE HIM
A LITTLE SLAP.

31:58.499 --> 31:59.709
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

31:59.709 --> 32:01.502
Baldwin: THERE'S A WITNESS
WHO SUPPORTS IT.

32:01.502 --> 32:04.297
A WOMAN WHO SITS BY A WINDOW
ALL DAY SAW WHAT HAPPENED.

32:04.297 --> 32:05.632
SHE'S LYING.

32:05.632 --> 32:08.384
HAVE YOU BEEN HAVING
SOME HARD LUCK RECENTLY?

32:08.384 --> 32:10.178
YOU LOOKING AT ME
AGAIN NOW?

32:10.178 --> 32:11.971
HAS HARD LUCK FORCED YOU
INTO DOING THINGS

32:11.971 --> 32:13.514
YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE
CONSIDERED DOING?

32:13.514 --> 32:16.100
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

32:16.100 --> 32:19.020
AFTER THE BLACK GUY HIT TIM
AND WALKED AWAY, WHAT WAS TIM
YELLING AT YOU ABOUT?

32:19.020 --> 32:20.313
TIM WAS ON THE GROUND.

32:20.313 --> 32:22.649
WAS HE ANGRY 'CAUSE YOU
DIDN'T HIT THE GUY BACK?

32:22.649 --> 32:24.734
HE WAS DYING
ON THE GROUND.

32:24.734 --> 32:26.569
WHAT GOT YOU
MAD ENOUGH TO KILL HIM?

32:26.569 --> 32:28.029
HE CALL YOU A FAG?

32:28.029 --> 32:29.864
WHY WOULD SOMETHING
LIKE THAT BOTHER ME?

32:29.864 --> 32:31.699
'CAUSE YOU'RE ASHAMED
YOU'VE BEEN DOING HIM

32:31.699 --> 32:32.742
TO KEEP YOURSELF FED.

32:32.742 --> 32:34.035
I NEVER TOUCHED HIM.

32:34.035 --> 32:36.037
BUT YOU LET HIM TOUCH YOU.
IS THAT RIGHT?

32:36.037 --> 32:38.331
YOU WERE DOING
WHAT YOU HAD TO DO

32:38.331 --> 32:39.874
TO SURVIVE,

32:39.874 --> 32:41.960
AND HE INSULTED YOU,
SO YOU HIT HIM.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.628
EXPLAIN IT THAT WAY,

32:43.628 --> 32:45.713
AND IT'S MOST LIKELY
MANSLAUGHTER,

32:45.713 --> 32:48.049
OR WE'LL GO
WITH WHAT THE WITNESS SAW

32:48.049 --> 32:49.842
AND WHAT COPS SAW
WHEN THEY DROVE UP --

32:49.842 --> 32:51.386
THAT YOU WERE GOING
THROUGH TIM'S POCKETS

32:51.386 --> 32:52.428
LOOKING TO STEAL
HIS WALLET.

32:52.428 --> 32:54.555
I-I WAS TRYING
TO HELP HIM.

32:54.555 --> 32:55.890
YOU GOT TO EXPLAIN THAT,

32:55.890 --> 32:58.393
OR YOU KILLED HIM
FOR HIS WALLET AND IT'S MURDER.

32:58.393 --> 33:00.061
WHAT HAPPENED
OUTSIDE THE BAR?

33:00.061 --> 33:02.689
THE BLACK GUY
SLAPPED HIM,

33:02.689 --> 33:04.816
AND I DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

33:04.816 --> 33:06.943
YOU SAW HIM.
THE GUY'S HUGE.

33:06.943 --> 33:08.528
WHAT DID TIM CALL YOU?

33:08.528 --> 33:10.488
FAGGOT, QUEEN.

33:10.488 --> 33:13.032
SAID HE BET
THAT I NEVER WAS A BOXER,

33:13.032 --> 33:15.410
THAT I WAS A BIGGER FAIRY
THAN HE EVER WAS.

33:15.410 --> 33:16.953
SO YOU HIT HIM.

33:16.953 --> 33:19.163
JUST ONCE.

33:19.163 --> 33:21.833
BUT HIS HEAD HIT THE SIDEWALK
LIKE A COCONUT.

33:21.833 --> 33:25.336
I SWEAR, I PROMISE,
I WASN'T STEALING HIS WALLET.

33:25.336 --> 33:27.505
I WAS TRYING TO HELP HIM.

33:31.968 --> 33:34.345
Ed: I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT COMPUTERS...

33:34.345 --> 33:35.430
I MEAN NOTHING...

33:36.681 --> 33:37.890
ONE SEC.

33:37.890 --> 33:40.685
HEY, CLARK.

33:40.685 --> 33:42.353
SMOKER'S COMING UP
IN A MONTH.

33:42.353 --> 33:43.730
GREAT.

33:43.730 --> 33:45.648
KIND OF HOPING SOMEONE
FROM THE DETECTIVE SQUAD

33:45.648 --> 33:46.941
WOULD FINALLY LACE THEM UP.

33:46.941 --> 33:49.444
I'M STARTING TO THINK YOU
GUYS ARE ALL SOFT UP THERE.

33:49.444 --> 33:50.945
IS THAT WHAT YOU
SPEND YOUR TIME

33:50.945 --> 33:51.946
HOPING FOR, LAUGHLIN?

33:51.946 --> 33:53.031
AAH, YOU'RE PROBABLY WORRIED

33:53.031 --> 33:54.657
ABOUT GETTING YOUR CUTE
LITTLE NOSE BROKE.

33:54.657 --> 33:57.702
LOOK, ALL'S I WAS TRYING
TO GET ACROSS TO YOU

33:57.702 --> 33:59.537
WAS ORTIZ HAS BEEN
THROUGH A LOT LATELY,

33:59.537 --> 34:01.414
AND SHE DON'T NEED ANYBODY
BRINGING MORE STATIC

34:01.414 --> 34:02.832
INTO HER LIFE.

34:02.832 --> 34:05.460
IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO TAKE MY WORD FOR IT,

34:05.460 --> 34:07.545
GO AHEAD, AND FIND OUT
FOR YOURSELF, OKAY?

34:07.545 --> 34:10.048
HOW IS SHE? CALIENTE?

34:10.048 --> 34:12.216
COME ON.
DON'T LIE TO ME.

34:12.216 --> 34:14.469
'CAUSE I REALLY NEED
TO KNOW.

34:14.469 --> 34:16.262
GIVE IT UP.

34:16.262 --> 34:17.889
I'M GOING TO KICK YOUR ASS.

34:17.889 --> 34:19.015
HA HA.

34:19.015 --> 34:21.893
SOMEONE'S IN
FOR A BIG, BIG SURPRISE.

34:21.893 --> 34:25.438
THANK YOU.
YOU MADE MY WEEK.

34:27.565 --> 34:29.233
Lipe: AND THE NEXT SUMMER,
GUESS WHO'S THERE --

34:29.233 --> 34:30.359
JOHNNY FOOTBALL HERO,

34:30.359 --> 34:32.820
AND HE PROCEEDED
TO TORTURE ME AGAIN.

34:32.820 --> 34:35.823
CAMP TOMAHAWK --
WHAT A JOKE.

34:35.823 --> 34:38.201
HE'S ALL YOURS.

34:41.245 --> 34:43.998
HOW LONG YOU BEEN
DRIVING A GYPSY CAB?

34:43.998 --> 34:46.000
THREE YEARS. WHY?

34:46.000 --> 34:47.627
YOU DROVE A YELLOW BEFORE?

34:47.627 --> 34:48.753
YES.

34:48.753 --> 34:50.004
WHY'D YOU SWITCH?

34:50.004 --> 34:51.464
YOU GET
YOUR LICENSE REVOKED?

34:51.464 --> 34:53.341
I TOLD THE LIMOUSINE
COMMISSION TO SHOVE IT.

34:53.341 --> 34:54.967
WHY?

34:54.967 --> 34:57.220
THEY TOLD US
WE HAD TO PICK UP THUGS.

34:57.220 --> 34:59.764
THEY EVEN WENT SO FAR
AS TO HAVE COPS, DECOYS,

34:59.764 --> 35:01.808
DRESSED LIKE BUSHWHACKERS
TRYING TO CALL A CAB.

35:01.808 --> 35:03.476
I GOT TWO SUMMONS
IN A ROW

35:03.476 --> 35:05.561
FOR FAILURE TO TAKE A FARE,
AND I SAID ENOUGH.

35:05.561 --> 35:07.105
WENT TO WORK
FOR A CAR SERVICE.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.023
YOU'RE A CAR,
YOU PICK UP WHO YOU WANT.

35:09.023 --> 35:11.400
SHOULDN'T YOU BE LOOKING
FOR THAT MAN FROM BOSTON

35:11.400 --> 35:12.568
WHO SOLD ME THAT GUN?

35:12.568 --> 35:15.029
YOU WERE ROBBED A MONTH
AND A HALF AGO IN HARLEM.

35:15.029 --> 35:16.614
IS THAT THE FIRST
TIME YOU'VE BEEN ROBBED?

35:16.614 --> 35:17.865
YES.

35:17.865 --> 35:19.617
HOW'D YOU GO
ALL THAT TIME BEFORE

35:19.617 --> 35:20.701
WITHOUT GETTING ROBBED?

35:20.701 --> 35:22.245
BY BEING CAREFUL.

35:22.245 --> 35:23.746
NOT DRIVING
ABOVE CENTRAL PARK.

35:23.746 --> 35:24.956
THAT'S ONE WAY, YES.

35:24.956 --> 35:26.916
NOT PICKING UP
CERTAIN TYPES OF PEOPLE.

35:26.916 --> 35:28.709
IS THIS NEWS TO YOU?

35:28.709 --> 35:31.003
SO THEN HOW DOES A CABBY
WHO KNOWS BETTER

35:31.003 --> 35:33.172
END UP GETTING ROBBED
IN HARLEM?

35:33.172 --> 35:35.675
MAYBE THAT CABBY, WHEN HE
STOPPED AT 61st AND PARK

35:35.675 --> 35:38.761
TO LET OFF A FARE AND A BLACK
KID JUMPS IN AT THE SAME TIME

35:38.761 --> 35:41.305
WANTING TO GO TO HARLEM,
AND THE CABBY TELLS HIM
HE'S OFF DUTY,

35:41.305 --> 35:44.100
THAT KID PULLS
A GUN AND PUTS IT
TO THE CABBY'S HEAD.

35:44.100 --> 35:46.352
MAYBE THAT WOULD GET HIM
UP TO 134th STREET.

35:46.352 --> 35:49.105
MAYBE THAT CABBY
GETS A GUN.

35:49.105 --> 35:50.606
MAYBE.

35:50.606 --> 35:52.233
MAYBE THE NEXT TIME
HE GETS ROBBED,

35:52.233 --> 35:53.860
HE DEFENDS HIMSELF,
WHICH FEELS PRETTY GOOD.

35:53.860 --> 35:55.403
NEXT TIME AFTER THAT,

35:55.403 --> 35:57.822
MAYBE THE GUY
DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A GUN,

35:57.822 --> 35:59.490
MAYBE THE CABBY'S NOT
GONNA TAKE ANY CHANCES.

35:59.490 --> 36:00.867
MAYBE.

36:00.867 --> 36:03.161
FIRST GUY HAD A GUN,
THAT'S ONE THING.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.663
BUT WHY WOULD A CABBY
KILL TWO MORE BLACK KIDS

36:05.663 --> 36:07.999
WHO WEREN'T ARMED?

36:07.999 --> 36:10.626
PEOPLE HAVE PATHS,

36:10.626 --> 36:12.003
AND THEY CROSS CONSTANTLY.

36:12.003 --> 36:14.463
MOST CROSSINGS ARE BENIGN
AND MEANINGLESS,

36:14.463 --> 36:16.549
BUT SOMETIMES
TWO PATHS CAN CONFLICT.

36:16.549 --> 36:18.217
TAKE, FOR EXAMPLE,
A CAB DRIVER

36:18.217 --> 36:20.261
WHO HAS BEEN
INSULTED, CHEATED,

36:20.261 --> 36:22.346
DISREGARDED, IGNORED,
NOW ROBBED AND BEATEN,

36:22.346 --> 36:24.515
SO THAT CAB DRIVER'S
FORCED TO CARRY A GUN.

36:24.515 --> 36:26.184
AND NOW OVER HERE
IS A BLACK KID

36:26.184 --> 36:28.060
WHO DOESN'T WANT TO PAY
FOR A RIDE,

36:28.060 --> 36:29.145
ESSENTIALLY
ROBBING THE CABBY.

36:29.145 --> 36:31.480
SO WHAT WE HAVE
ARE TWO PATHS CROSSING

36:31.480 --> 36:33.691
AND CONFLICTING.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

36:33.691 --> 36:36.652
SO THE CABBY IS JUSTIFIED
KILLING SOMEBODY WHO
DOESN'T PAY.

36:36.652 --> 36:39.363
MY SENSE IS THAT IT WOULD
BE OUT OF THE CABBY'S HANDS
AT THIS POINT.

36:39.363 --> 36:43.201
WE HAVE A WITNESS
WHO SAW YOU ON 145th STREET

36:43.201 --> 36:44.535
TWO WEEKS AGO

36:44.535 --> 36:46.495
WHEN YOU SHOT THAT MAN
IN THE CHEST.

36:46.495 --> 36:48.331
NOW, I KNOW
YOU DON'T TRUST THE NYPD

36:48.331 --> 36:50.499
AND YOU DON'T LIKE
COOPERATING WITH US,

36:50.499 --> 36:52.084
BUT I'M GONNA
TELL YOU, MR. LIPE,

36:52.084 --> 36:53.628
YOU'RE GONNA GET CHARGED
WITH THESE SHOOTINGS.

36:53.628 --> 36:55.630
IT'S ALL
OUT OF MY HANDS NOW.

36:55.630 --> 36:57.173
NO, IT ISN'T.

36:57.173 --> 36:58.966
NO. YOU TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED.

36:58.966 --> 37:00.968
YOU HELP YOURSELF
BY COMING CLEAN,

37:00.968 --> 37:03.012
AND WE CAN
WORK OUT A DEAL.

37:03.012 --> 37:04.597
ONCE YOU GO
INTO THE SYSTEM,

37:04.597 --> 37:06.265
<i>THEN </i>IT'S
OUT OF YOUR HANDS.

37:06.265 --> 37:08.601
RIGHT NOW,
YOU STILL CONTROL YOUR FATE.

37:14.232 --> 37:16.817
WHAT'S AT ISSUE HERE

37:16.817 --> 37:21.614
IS HOW MUCH
CAN ONE PERSON WITHSTAND?

37:21.614 --> 37:23.741
THAT'S WHAT NEEDS
TO BE ADDRESSED.

37:23.741 --> 37:26.661
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT, THEN.

37:40.216 --> 37:41.384
GOOD NIGHT.

37:46.097 --> 37:47.932
DID LIPE GO?
YEAH.

37:47.932 --> 37:49.100
FOR ALL THREE HOMICIDES?

37:49.100 --> 37:50.518
YEAH.

37:50.518 --> 37:53.187
'CAUSE HE WAS BEING ROBBED?
FIRST ONE WAS HALF A SHOT,

37:53.187 --> 37:54.563
IT WAS JUSTIFIED.
THE NEXT TWO...

37:54.563 --> 37:56.482
THIS GUY'S
COMING APART AT THE SEAMS.

37:56.482 --> 37:57.858
ANY WORD FROM RODRIGUEZ?

37:57.858 --> 37:58.943
NOTHING.

37:58.943 --> 38:00.820
WE KNOW
HE WASN'T LOCKED UP,

38:00.820 --> 38:02.405
SO THAT'S A GOOD SIGN.

38:02.405 --> 38:04.198
OR THEY'RE TOYING
WITH HIM LIKE A MOUSE

38:04.198 --> 38:05.616
TILL THEY'RE READY
TO MOVE IN.

38:05.616 --> 38:07.618
SHOULD WE SEE WHAT
WE CAN FIND OUT?

38:07.618 --> 38:09.287
A BUNCH OF CALLS
COULD AGGRAVATE IT.

38:09.287 --> 38:11.622
SO WE SIT HERE STEWING.

38:11.622 --> 38:12.873
NO, WE, UH...

38:12.873 --> 38:15.167
WE GO HOME, AND IF RODRIGUEZ
CALLS ANY OF US

38:15.167 --> 38:17.712
WITH A COURSE OF ACTION,
WE PASS IT ALONG TO THE OTHERS.

38:17.712 --> 38:19.171
YEAH, I GUESS.

38:19.171 --> 38:21.924
I'M GOING TO STAY AND WORK
ON SOME OF THE FIVES TONIGHT.

38:21.924 --> 38:23.467
ANYTHING COMES UP,
I'LL CALL YOU.

38:33.686 --> 38:36.147
HEY.

38:36.147 --> 38:38.274
I HEAR YOU'RE FIGHTING
LAUGHLIN IN THE SMOKER.

38:38.274 --> 38:40.818
WORD'S OUT, HUH?

38:40.818 --> 38:43.821
IS IT ABOUT HIM
BEING AN IDIOT TO ME?

38:43.821 --> 38:46.991
I-I GUESS IT
STARTED THERE, YEAH.

38:46.991 --> 38:48.200
WELL, IT'S NICE OF YOU,

38:48.200 --> 38:49.702
BUT I'VE HANDLED JERKS
LIKE HIM BEFORE.

38:49.702 --> 38:52.538
LAUGHLIN'S GOT AN ATTITUDE
THAT NEEDS SOME READJUSTMENT.

38:55.583 --> 38:58.294
YOU EVER FOUGHT?

38:58.294 --> 38:59.337
SURE.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.380
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

39:02.715 --> 39:04.800
THEY GOT HEADGEAR
AND MOUTH GUARDS,

39:04.800 --> 39:06.510
REFEREES --
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

39:06.510 --> 39:10.181
SOMEONE STANDING UP FOR ME --
THAT'S A BIG DEAL.

39:11.515 --> 39:13.100
YOU DESERVE
TO BE STOOD UP FOR.

39:22.026 --> 39:22.943
THANKS.

39:24.737 --> 39:26.614
UM...

39:26.614 --> 39:28.532
HEY, I BETTER GET GOING.

39:28.532 --> 39:30.284
OKAY. I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

39:47.718 --> 39:49.553
HEY, JOHN.

39:49.553 --> 39:50.888
HI.

39:50.888 --> 39:52.890
DADDY, JOHN'S HERE.

39:58.896 --> 40:00.606
I'LL BE OUTSIDE.

40:04.360 --> 40:06.153
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

40:06.153 --> 40:08.697
I WANT TO CALL A TRUCE.
CAN WE DO THAT?

40:08.697 --> 40:11.367
ONLY IF YOU CAN ACCEPT ME
FOR WHO I AM.

40:11.367 --> 40:12.660
I'M TIRED, JOHN.

40:12.660 --> 40:14.912
I DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH
ALL OF THAT AGAIN.

40:14.912 --> 40:16.664
THEN WHY DID YOU ASK ME
TO COME?

40:16.664 --> 40:18.916
IT SHOULDN'T BE
TOO MUCH TO EXPECT

40:18.916 --> 40:21.001
MY ONLY SON TO SHOW UP

40:21.001 --> 40:22.420
AND COMFORT ME
ON MY DEATHBED.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.213
YOU SAID
I'D SHAMED THE FAMILY.

40:24.213 --> 40:25.548
YOU DISOWNED ME.

40:25.548 --> 40:27.466
AM I JUST SUPPOSED
TO FORGET ALL THAT?

40:27.466 --> 40:30.344
MAYBE NOT FORGET IT,
BUT FORGIVE IT.

40:30.344 --> 40:32.847
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

40:34.890 --> 40:36.767
I'M DYING, JOHN.

40:36.767 --> 40:39.895
I'M SCARED. IT DOESN'T
GET MUCH SIMPLER THAN THAT.

40:39.895 --> 40:42.731
I WAS SCARED, TOO,

40:42.731 --> 40:47.278
AND WHEN I CAME TO YOU
FOR COMFORT AND UNDERSTANDING,

40:47.278 --> 40:49.029
YOU ABANDONED ME.

40:49.029 --> 40:50.698
YOU CAN'T JUST
WAVE A MAGIC WAND

40:50.698 --> 40:52.575
AND MAKE THAT GO AWAY.

40:52.575 --> 40:55.828
BEING GAY WASN'T A CHOICE.

40:55.828 --> 40:57.329
WHY WOULD I CHOOSE A LIFE

40:57.329 --> 40:59.915
THAT COST ME
MY FATHER'S LOVE?

41:01.667 --> 41:05.004
I DO LOVE YOU, JOHNNY.
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED YOU.

41:06.088 --> 41:08.132
YOU'RE MY SON.

41:10.426 --> 41:12.136
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

41:12.136 --> 41:14.305
CAN WE LEAVE IT AT THAT?

41:14.305 --> 41:17.016
OKAY.

41:36.202 --> 41:38.954
I ONLY GOT A MINUTE.

41:38.954 --> 41:42.416
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH RODRIGUEZ AND FRAKER?

41:42.416 --> 41:45.461
I'M SUPPOSED TO JUST SPEW OUT
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION?

41:45.461 --> 41:47.963
IF YOU'RE NOT,
WHY'D YOU SHOW UP?
I'D BE HAPPY TO LEAVE.

41:47.963 --> 41:50.132
SO NOW YOU'RE
ON THE SAME LEVEL WITH FRAKER --

41:50.132 --> 41:52.301
AN ASSHOLE WHO'S GOT
NO PROBLEM

41:52.301 --> 41:54.136
HANGING OUT A DECENT GUY
FOR NOTHING,

41:54.136 --> 41:56.472
WHICH I KNOW YOU'RE NOT.

41:56.472 --> 41:58.766
THE WAY I HEARD IT,

41:58.766 --> 42:01.018
RODRIGUEZ DIDN'T REPORT
A BRIBE ATTEMPT.

42:01.018 --> 42:03.229
ATTEMPT, MEANING HE
DIDN'T TAKE IT.

42:03.229 --> 42:04.605
IT'S STILL A JACKPOT.

42:04.605 --> 42:06.065
NO, IT'S A LOAD OF CRAP.

42:06.065 --> 42:09.235
WHO'S THE GUY THAT
SET HIM UP -- THE FRIEND?

42:09.235 --> 42:11.529
DANIEL VEGA,
RETIRED OFF THE JOB.

42:11.529 --> 42:13.656
LAST YEAR HE GOT NAILED
USING HIS OLD BADGE

42:13.656 --> 42:15.491
TO SHAKE DOWN
DOPE DEALERS FOR CASH.

42:15.491 --> 42:16.867
HE OFFERED HIMSELF UP.

42:16.867 --> 42:18.869
SO HOW'D FRAKER
MAKE THE CONNECTION

42:18.869 --> 42:20.704
BETWEEN VEGA AND RODRIGUEZ?

42:20.704 --> 42:22.748
HE'S BEEN LOOKING
INTO RODRIGUEZ.

42:22.748 --> 42:24.500
I GUESS THEY HAVE A HISTORY.

42:24.500 --> 42:26.210
WELL, THAT'S
FAIRLY CLEAR, MARTENS,

42:26.210 --> 42:27.545
BUT WHAT'S THE HISTORY?

42:27.545 --> 42:29.713
THE WAY I HEARD IT,
RODRIGUEZ IS THE REASON

42:29.713 --> 42:31.090
THAT FRAKER'S
IN INTERNAL AFFAIRS.

42:31.090 --> 42:32.758
MEANING WHAT?

42:32.758 --> 42:35.177
WHEN RODRIGUEZ WAS
IN UNDERCOVER NARCOTICS,

42:35.177 --> 42:37.346
FRAKER WAS IN UNIFORM,
APPARENTLY RIDING SHOTGUN

42:37.346 --> 42:39.598
FOR SOME GUY HE DIDN'T
KNOW WAS A DOPE DEALER.

42:39.598 --> 42:41.392
YOUR BOY RATTED HIM OUT.

42:41.392 --> 42:43.477
RODRIGUEZ GAVE HIM UP
BY NAME?

42:43.477 --> 42:44.812
I DON'T KNOW.

42:44.812 --> 42:46.272
YOU DON'T SAY A GUY'S A RAT

42:46.272 --> 42:47.815
AND LET IT SIT THERE
LIKE A TURD.

42:47.815 --> 42:49.275
I TOLD YOU WHAT I KNOW.

42:49.275 --> 42:51.485
IF IT'S TRUE, RODRIGUEZ
HAD TO HAVE A REP FOR IT.

42:51.485 --> 42:52.903
MAYBE, MAYBE NOT.

42:55.864 --> 42:57.366
SO NOW FRAKER'S AFTER HIM.

42:57.366 --> 42:59.743
THE WAY HE SEES IT,
RODRIGUEZ DROPPED THE DIME,

42:59.743 --> 43:02.830
PUT HIM INTO INTERNAL AFFAIRS,
WHERE HE NEVER WANTED TO BE,

43:02.830 --> 43:04.999
AND EVEN THOUGH
FRAKER HAS MADE CAPTAIN,

43:04.999 --> 43:06.542
HE'S STILL A BITTER PRICK

43:06.542 --> 43:08.627
'CAUSE HE KNOWS
WITH THIS STINK ON HIM,

43:08.627 --> 43:10.421
HE'LL NEVER BE
ABLE TO LEAVE IAB.

43:13.465 --> 43:17.011
RODRIGUEZ GAVE UP COPS.
YOU'RE SURE?

43:17.011 --> 43:19.888
GOOD ADVICE
IS START SWIMMING

43:19.888 --> 43:22.433
SO RODRIGUEZ DOESN'T
PULL YOU DOWN WITH HIM.

43:24.059 --> 43:25.519
I GOT TO GO.
