00:02.170 --> 00:03.421
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

00:03.922 --> 00:06.091
- Is it loaded?
- Ain't no point in an unloaded gun.

00:06.341 --> 00:07.759
It's Kristen Kringle's final paychecks.

00:07.926 --> 00:09.427
She never picked them up. I don't like it.

00:09.594 --> 00:11.137
<i>Oswald,
you are making progress.</i>

00:11.805 --> 00:16.518
By the laws of Gotham City,
he is hereby declared sane.

00:16.685 --> 00:17.936
<i>You are a free man.</i>

00:18.103 --> 00:20.939
I was wondering if you'd heard
from Kristen Kringle lately.

00:22.607 --> 00:24.401
Do you think
that something bad has happened?

00:25.276 --> 00:28.321
<i>- We have no idea when she might wake up.</i>
- Bitch.

00:28.530 --> 00:30.240
<i>So, that's the game is it, Jimbo?</i>

00:30.407 --> 00:31.825
<i>Gonna try to outsmart me?</i>

00:31.991 --> 00:33.034
<i>I don't think so.</i>

00:33.243 --> 00:34.285
We've met before?

00:34.452 --> 00:36.996
Yes. You killed my parents.
Who hired you?

00:37.163 --> 00:38.415
You'll never know their name.

00:38.581 --> 00:40.417
I'm a monster. You need to kill me.

00:41.501 --> 00:43.211
- You're just a man.
- Bruce.

00:43.545 --> 00:44.671
He's in there.

00:48.591 --> 00:50.135
<i>Alfred,
I have left home for a while</i>

00:50.301 --> 00:51.803
<i>to live on the streets with Selina.</i>

00:51.970 --> 00:53.847
<i>Trust me, and honor my wishes.</i>

00:54.013 --> 00:55.515
<i>Don't try to bring me back.</i>

01:00.520 --> 01:02.647
<i>Welcome to the Gotham Museum of Art.</i>

01:02.814 --> 01:04.691
<i>The museum offers hundreds of new events</i>

01:04.858 --> 01:07.819
<i>and programs each month,
including lectures,</i>

01:08.027 --> 01:11.906
<i>performances, tours,
family activities and more.</i>

01:12.240 --> 01:15.994
<i>The Gotham Museum cafe and gift shop
is located on the fourth floor...</i>

02:03.541 --> 02:04.626
Keep moving!

02:16.930 --> 02:18.014
Stop!

02:37.408 --> 02:40.411
Solo robber hit the museum
about an hour ago.

02:40.578 --> 02:42.997
Scared people away
with a bomb that never went off.

02:43.164 --> 02:44.582
- Anybody hurt?
<i>- Nope.</i>

02:44.749 --> 02:47.043
Why us, then?
Isn't it a Robbery Squad case?

02:47.252 --> 02:50.588
Bomb threats are you guys,
whether the bomb goes off or not.

02:50.755 --> 02:51.756
<i>So, get on it.</i>

02:52.966 --> 02:54.259
Gordon, you stay.

03:01.057 --> 03:04.978
Internal Affairs is reopening the file
on Galavan's murder.

03:07.105 --> 03:08.189
Why?

03:09.816 --> 03:11.276
Anonymous tip.

03:11.442 --> 03:13.987
Someone called in, claims they saw you,

03:14.737 --> 03:17.991
not Penguin, kill Galavan
that night at the docks.

03:18.324 --> 03:20.410
IA gets a dozen crank calls a week.

03:21.119 --> 03:22.203
They're probably just bored.

03:22.412 --> 03:24.789
This tip came with a detail
we didn't put out to the public.

03:26.332 --> 03:27.584
The umbrella.

03:28.793 --> 03:31.796
So someone in the GCPD
is trying to make trouble for me.

03:32.255 --> 03:33.298
By spreading lies.

03:33.464 --> 03:34.674
Been known to happen.

03:34.841 --> 03:35.884
Lies, huh?

03:36.050 --> 03:37.677
Tell me the truth again.

03:38.928 --> 03:40.555
I didn't kill Galavan.

03:40.722 --> 03:41.806
I wasn't there.

03:44.309 --> 03:45.768
What was that all about?

03:45.935 --> 03:47.061
Later.

03:47.812 --> 03:49.647
- Detective Gordon.
- Hey, Ed.

03:49.814 --> 03:50.857
I'm ready for our sit-down.

03:51.024 --> 03:52.108
Our what?

03:52.275 --> 03:53.318
You wanted to interview me

03:53.484 --> 03:55.153
about Ms. Kringle leaving town
with Officer Dougherty?

03:55.445 --> 03:57.822
Oh, right. Yeah, sorry. Rain check.

03:58.072 --> 03:59.490
We got to get to Gotham Museum.

03:59.657 --> 04:01.034
Oh, the art heist.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.368
Yes, I heard about this.

04:02.535 --> 04:03.745
Very bold.

04:04.078 --> 04:05.914
Uh, yes, rain check.

04:06.539 --> 04:09.292
Tally-ho, chaps. Go get that bad guy.

04:10.835 --> 04:12.420
We'll talk later this afternoon.
And Ed?

04:12.962 --> 04:15.506
Don't worry. I'll find out
what happened to Ms. Kringle.

04:15.757 --> 04:18.676
I have the utmost faith in your abilities,
Detective Gordon.

04:19.928 --> 04:21.137
Believe me.

04:33.024 --> 04:34.108
Boss?

04:34.275 --> 04:36.110
You'll never guess
who just knocked on the door.

04:36.277 --> 04:38.571
If I'll never guess,
then why not just tell me, jackass?

04:38.821 --> 04:41.824
If you say I have three guesses,
well, then that's a game.

04:42.158 --> 04:44.535
It's an annoying and stupid game,
but at least it makes sense.

04:44.702 --> 04:45.828
Son of a...

04:46.204 --> 04:48.623
Hi.

04:51.042 --> 04:53.044
Well, well, well.

04:53.211 --> 04:54.671
I heard they let you out of Arkham.

04:54.837 --> 04:55.880
Yes.

04:56.464 --> 04:58.216
Happy day.

04:58.841 --> 05:00.009
I'm sane.

05:00.301 --> 05:01.970
I have a certificate.

05:02.387 --> 05:03.638
Whoa.

05:05.306 --> 05:06.724
Uh...

05:07.016 --> 05:09.227
<i>But... But I... I hope I'm not intruding.</i>

05:09.394 --> 05:11.354
I just got back in town,

05:12.605 --> 05:15.066
and thought it'd be rude
not to say hello to an old friend.

05:16.985 --> 05:18.194
An old friend?

05:18.361 --> 05:19.404
<i>Well, yes.</i>

05:19.570 --> 05:21.239
I mean, we had our ups and downs,

05:21.406 --> 05:24.158
but on the whole,
I thought we were friends.

05:24.909 --> 05:26.077
<i>Weren't we?</i>

05:26.327 --> 05:28.371
That's what I recall, anyhow.

05:29.455 --> 05:30.790
Cupcake?

05:33.710 --> 05:35.670
You killed my brother.

05:37.338 --> 05:39.632
You messed with his mind
and made him your slave.

05:39.799 --> 05:40.800
Hello?

05:41.134 --> 05:42.885
I guess I was pretty terrible, huh?

05:43.428 --> 05:45.138
I want to apologize sincerely.

05:45.930 --> 05:47.724
I wasn't thinking straight.

05:48.266 --> 05:49.350
Apology accepted.

05:50.101 --> 05:51.102
Let's kill him.

05:51.519 --> 05:53.271
Wait. What?

05:53.438 --> 05:55.606
Uh, Butch, listen, I've changed.

05:55.773 --> 05:57.567
You have no reason to fear me. I'm...

05:57.859 --> 06:00.194
I'm a good person now.

06:04.699 --> 06:07.118
I was thinking about
visiting your mother's grave.

06:07.326 --> 06:08.578
- Oh?
- Mmm.

06:08.786 --> 06:10.246
Miss the old bird.

06:11.122 --> 06:14.250
Her sobs would often lull me
to sleep at night.

06:14.417 --> 06:15.918
"Oswald!

06:16.085 --> 06:17.628
"Oswald!

06:17.795 --> 06:19.630
"Save me."

06:24.260 --> 06:25.845
That does sound like her.

06:27.138 --> 06:28.514
<i>You know, I think he's for real.</i>

06:28.723 --> 06:31.225
Those loony bin doctors
must have done a real number on him.

06:31.392 --> 06:32.477
It's actually kind of sad.

06:33.478 --> 06:34.479
Let him go.

06:35.396 --> 06:37.315
What?

06:38.524 --> 06:39.859
You heard me.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.070
Look at him, he's a pathetic loser.

06:42.236 --> 06:43.529
<i>He doesn't pose a threat to anyone.</i>

06:43.696 --> 06:45.406
Are you serious?

06:45.573 --> 06:47.075
No way! He has to die.

06:48.493 --> 06:49.660
Who's the boss here?

06:51.954 --> 06:54.373
I believe in an eye for an eye.
We've all lost something, including him.

07:02.006 --> 07:03.132
We're square, you and me.

07:03.591 --> 07:05.551
- Understand?
- Completely.

07:08.137 --> 07:10.056
Mmm.

07:13.976 --> 07:17.146
Fine. You know,
I didn't realize you were so sentimental.

07:18.231 --> 07:20.608
He's not leaving
without some kind of punishment.

07:22.860 --> 07:24.612
- He's not.
<i>- Okay.</i>

07:25.279 --> 07:26.447
What'd you have in mind?

07:43.381 --> 07:46.592
Your little private,
inside voice is screaming.

07:46.759 --> 07:49.428
Want to tell me what that pow-wow
with Barnes was all about?

07:51.722 --> 07:55.810
IA is re-opening the investigation
into the murder of Theo Galavan.

07:57.186 --> 07:58.688
Anonymous person called in,

07:59.105 --> 08:00.731
saying they saw me kill him.

08:03.943 --> 08:05.570
That old chestnut, huh?

08:06.737 --> 08:08.197
Is there something I can do?

08:08.489 --> 08:10.408
You still friendly
with your gal over in IA?

08:10.867 --> 08:11.909
Ginny?

08:12.910 --> 08:14.453
Our paths have been known to cross.

08:14.620 --> 08:16.497
Can they cross again soon?

08:17.248 --> 08:18.749
I need to know what they have.

08:21.210 --> 08:22.295
Sure.

08:29.594 --> 08:30.720
Mr. Thatch?

08:31.345 --> 08:32.388
Detective Gordon.

08:32.597 --> 08:33.681
This is Detective Bullock.

08:33.848 --> 08:35.766
What can you tell us
about the painting that was stolen?

08:35.933 --> 08:38.019
Uh, the painting
is entitled <i>Mad Grey Dawn,</i>

08:38.394 --> 08:41.355
and it depicted a railway explosion
at the turn of the century.

08:41.522 --> 08:44.275
A minor work
compared to much of the collection.

08:44.442 --> 08:47.862
Strangely, he simply defaced
two much more valuable paintings

08:48.029 --> 08:50.031
in another section of the gallery.

08:50.198 --> 08:52.033
A Marché and a Larue.

08:52.658 --> 08:53.743
Follow me.

08:56.537 --> 08:57.622
<i>Priceless.</i>

08:57.788 --> 09:02.418
What kind of art thief would take time
to defile such masterpieces?

09:02.585 --> 09:04.545
- An ignorant one?
- No.

09:04.712 --> 09:05.963
<i>This took a lot of time and effort.</i>

09:06.130 --> 09:07.381
He knows what he's doing.

09:07.548 --> 09:09.967
He's not interested in profit.
He's trying to send a message.

09:10.134 --> 09:11.135
Which is what?

09:11.928 --> 09:13.012
No idea.

09:13.554 --> 09:14.972
What about the painters themselves?

09:15.139 --> 09:16.224
What about them?

09:16.390 --> 09:18.893
<i>Question marks are directly over
their signatures on the canvas.</i>

09:19.977 --> 09:23.564
There's entire books written
on each of them.

09:23.731 --> 09:25.149
- I'm sorry, I--
<i>- He would want to keep it simple.</i>

09:25.316 --> 09:26.984
What about their names?

09:28.361 --> 09:30.696
"Marché" means "market"
and "Larue" is "the road," yes?

09:30.863 --> 09:31.948
Yes.

09:32.114 --> 09:33.115
Or "the street."

09:33.866 --> 09:34.951
Market Street.

09:36.953 --> 09:40.498
The painting he stole
depicted a railway explosion? Yes?

09:40.831 --> 09:42.833
Yes. A bombing actually.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.710
It was known as Bloody Monday.

09:44.877 --> 09:46.003
Today is Monday.

09:46.921 --> 09:49.048
And Union Railway Station
is on Market Street.

10:11.821 --> 10:16.158
<i>Attention, please evacuate
the train station in an orderly fashion.</i>

10:16.867 --> 10:20.121
<i>Please find your nearest exit
and evacuate the train station.</i>

10:20.288 --> 10:21.706
<i>Thank you.</i>

10:21.872 --> 10:23.582
- What are we looking for?
- I have no idea.

10:23.749 --> 10:25.626
<i>Get these people out of here. Go, go!</i>

10:25.876 --> 10:28.129
<i>- Get outta here! Go!</i>
- Move! Move!

10:36.637 --> 10:37.722
Come on.

10:40.391 --> 10:41.475
Bullock.

10:54.947 --> 10:57.575
Listen up!
The device is inside the lockers.

10:57.825 --> 11:00.286
Pinkney, get these people out of here.
Get them out of here.

11:00.453 --> 11:01.662
<i>Outside, now!</i>

11:02.496 --> 11:04.248
Get them out of here! Go!

11:16.677 --> 11:18.471
How much time
till the bomb squad gets here?

11:18.637 --> 11:20.931
Too long. Get back.

11:21.098 --> 11:23.142
Okay, get back. Back, back, back.
Go, go, go!

11:23.309 --> 11:24.518
Go, go, go, go.

12:14.443 --> 12:17.196
- Hey, Ivy.
- Hey, Cat.

12:17.863 --> 12:19.573
Hey, Billionaire Boy.

12:19.740 --> 12:21.325
What is he doing here?

12:21.575 --> 12:24.412
Shh. They're right upstairs.

12:24.912 --> 12:27.039
He's staying with me for a while.

12:27.206 --> 12:28.207
Don't touch anything.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.544
What is this place?

12:31.710 --> 12:34.672
Ivy works for a gang
that runs the magic mushroom trade.

12:36.465 --> 12:38.008
What's a magic mushroom?

12:38.259 --> 12:40.594
Some give you visions.
Some give you energy.

12:40.970 --> 12:42.096
Some help you to sleep.

12:42.263 --> 12:44.056
I've cultivated over a dozen kinds.

12:44.807 --> 12:46.183
What are we doing here?

12:46.892 --> 12:50.396
The gang is run
by Gilzean's nephew, Sonny,

12:51.439 --> 12:53.107
and his merry band of losers.

12:55.526 --> 12:57.069
So, these mushrooms are illegal?

12:57.361 --> 13:00.406
Yes, very illegal.

13:00.573 --> 13:02.032
Which means there's always
a ton of cash around.

13:02.366 --> 13:03.367
You're going to rob them?

13:04.535 --> 13:05.536
Uh...

13:05.911 --> 13:06.954
Yeah.

13:11.625 --> 13:12.710
Okay.

13:13.711 --> 13:14.753
How do we do it?

13:17.548 --> 13:18.591
We don't.

13:19.049 --> 13:20.676
You have money, remember?

13:20.843 --> 13:21.886
A lot of it.

13:22.052 --> 13:23.095
<i>Selina, I told you.</i>

13:23.262 --> 13:24.430
I want to survive on my own,

13:24.597 --> 13:26.265
find out who I am without my money.

13:26.432 --> 13:27.892
Without being Bruce Wayne.

13:28.476 --> 13:32.229
Besides, I don't mind stealing
if it's from criminals.

13:34.482 --> 13:35.566
What's the plan?

13:41.906 --> 13:43.574
Meet Psilocybe Arkrescens.

13:43.741 --> 13:45.826
<i>Also known as the blue devil.</i>

13:45.993 --> 13:48.329
She slipped a few of them
in the gang's lunch today,

13:48.829 --> 13:50.289
so all we have to do now is wait.

13:50.456 --> 13:52.124
- What will they do?
- Instant death.

13:53.584 --> 13:55.127
Kidding.

13:55.294 --> 13:57.087
They'll be in a state of relaxed bliss.

13:57.254 --> 13:58.464
Like a dream.

13:58.631 --> 14:00.090
Trust me, it's great.

14:02.593 --> 14:03.761
How long until they're out?

14:08.724 --> 14:11.435
From art thief to mad bomber
in the same day?

14:11.602 --> 14:12.770
What the hell is next?

14:12.937 --> 14:15.564
I don't know. But he wanted us to find it.

14:15.731 --> 14:17.274
I think that's what the heist was about.

14:17.441 --> 14:18.692
He's playing a game.

14:19.318 --> 14:21.278
Great.

14:21.445 --> 14:23.656
That's exactly what this city needs.

14:27.326 --> 14:29.245
Did you find any other brainteasers

14:29.411 --> 14:32.164
that might indicate his next piece
of performance art?

14:32.331 --> 14:36.460
No. Either he's decided to keep it
a surprise or he's taking a break.

14:36.835 --> 14:38.462
I doubt we're that lucky.

14:39.171 --> 14:41.632
I want every available resource
on this thing.

14:42.007 --> 14:43.050
You got it.

14:45.970 --> 14:47.137
Excuse me.

14:47.304 --> 14:49.890
Officer Pinkney, can I get your signature
on this chain of custody form?

14:50.057 --> 14:51.141
Sure.

14:52.685 --> 14:54.186
- Thank you.
- Pinkney.

14:56.355 --> 14:57.481
Detective Gordon.

14:58.148 --> 14:59.900
We've been working together
for over a year, Ed.

15:00.067 --> 15:01.652
You can call me Jim.

15:01.819 --> 15:03.988
Jim. Heard you were able to save the day.

15:04.405 --> 15:05.573
I got lucky.

15:05.739 --> 15:06.991
I don't believe in luck.

15:07.157 --> 15:09.159
You saw a problem
and you solved it. Bravo.

15:10.202 --> 15:12.621
Hey, I want you
to oversee forensics on this one.

15:12.788 --> 15:13.831
Maybe our luck will hold

15:13.998 --> 15:16.917
and we'll get something
on the bomb signature or trace elements.

15:17.084 --> 15:18.127
No other leads yet?

15:18.544 --> 15:21.171
No. I have no idea
what this guy wants

15:21.338 --> 15:23.716
or what he's after,
which makes him dangerous.

15:24.466 --> 15:26.427
Oh, don't you worry. I'm on the case.

15:26.677 --> 15:27.761
Right.

15:38.814 --> 15:39.815
Shh.

15:40.608 --> 15:42.026
Be quiet.

15:42.192 --> 15:43.527
Someone might still be awake.

16:19.229 --> 16:20.314
Who... Who are you?

16:20.481 --> 16:22.316
Hey! Hey, hey.

16:23.734 --> 16:24.860
We're no one.

16:26.528 --> 16:29.573
You're dreaming. Pretty cool, right?

16:29.740 --> 16:30.824
Totally.

16:31.867 --> 16:33.369
Yeah.

16:33.535 --> 16:37.706
Listen, if you give us the coffee can
and close your eyes,

16:37.873 --> 16:39.083
you'll be able to fly.

16:40.084 --> 16:42.920
Sweet.

16:54.098 --> 16:55.224
Run.

16:58.936 --> 17:00.813
Whoa! Where you going?

17:04.066 --> 17:05.943
Hey, Cat.

17:07.528 --> 17:08.987
Hey, Sonny.

17:10.572 --> 17:12.741
You lose weight?

17:13.117 --> 17:15.327
Keep cracking wise, Selina.

17:15.494 --> 17:17.955
You ain't gonna be smiling
when my uncle gets to you.

17:19.623 --> 17:21.625
Let's see how many lives
you really have left.

17:38.142 --> 17:40.519
- Hi.
<i>- Penguin?</i>

17:40.728 --> 17:42.521
<i>- Hi. Hi.</i>
- Hi.

17:42.980 --> 17:44.231
Sorry to intrude.

17:45.149 --> 17:47.359
Bit of a mess.

17:47.901 --> 17:50.362
I was just passing by and...

17:51.822 --> 17:53.323
May I...

17:53.490 --> 17:55.075
Could I come in for a moment?

17:55.242 --> 17:56.994
These feathers aren't as warm
as they look.

17:57.536 --> 18:00.539
Of course. Where are my manners?
Uh, it's... It's so good to see you.

18:02.082 --> 18:05.169
So, how have you been, old friend?
Well, I hope.

18:05.335 --> 18:06.545
Yeah, well.

18:06.712 --> 18:08.714
I have been. Been busy.
I've been really busy.

18:08.881 --> 18:11.049
And what about you?
I hear that you've been released.

18:11.216 --> 18:12.843
What... What just... What happened?

18:13.218 --> 18:15.137
Oh, oh.

18:15.345 --> 18:18.515
Well, just good old Butch
and Tabitha having fun.

18:18.682 --> 18:20.225
They talked about killing me,

18:21.602 --> 18:23.645
so this was actually pretty nice
of them, considering.

18:24.396 --> 18:25.439
Pretty nice of them?

18:25.606 --> 18:27.858
They did a pretty good job
on you in Arkham, huh?

18:29.693 --> 18:32.112
I'm here to tell you, Ed, as a friend,

18:32.279 --> 18:34.656
violence and anger are not the answer.

18:34.823 --> 18:36.325
I am a changed man.

18:36.492 --> 18:38.869
Better, and you can change, too.

18:39.411 --> 18:41.121
Cool.

18:41.413 --> 18:43.373
Tempting offer.

18:43.791 --> 18:45.709
The thing is,

18:46.084 --> 18:48.837
the me I am right now
is kind of hitting my stride.

18:49.046 --> 18:50.297
Oh.

18:50.547 --> 18:52.257
And I'm really grateful
for all that you've taught me,

18:52.758 --> 18:56.220
and that bad stuff you told me
about Jim Gordon is really paying off.

18:57.679 --> 18:58.722
- Is it?
<i>- It is.</i>

18:58.889 --> 19:00.307
It's helped me to create
the perfect puzzle

19:00.474 --> 19:01.892
to get rid of my Jim Gordon dilemma.

19:02.059 --> 19:03.685
<i>Normally, I would love to share,</i>

19:03.852 --> 19:06.063
but to be honest,
the new you is kind of freaking me out.

19:10.067 --> 19:12.194
I'm just really busy right now.

19:12.361 --> 19:15.072
Well, I'll be on my way.

19:16.824 --> 19:17.908
Thanks for coming by.

19:26.667 --> 19:28.293
So, I spoke with my gal in IA.

19:28.460 --> 19:30.671
The snitch said
Penguin was beating Galavan to death

19:30.838 --> 19:34.049
when you stepped in
and put a bullet in his chest.

19:39.638 --> 19:41.348
Someone else was there that night.

19:43.267 --> 19:45.060
Either that, or Penguin talked.

19:45.227 --> 19:46.270
He did just get out of Arkham.

19:46.436 --> 19:48.355
How the hell he did, I'll never know.

19:48.522 --> 19:50.607
But lest we forget he was in there

19:50.774 --> 19:52.317
for a murder you committed.

19:53.569 --> 19:55.404
A grudge is not beyond
the realm of possibility.

19:55.571 --> 19:56.947
He could have talked when he was arrested.

19:57.114 --> 19:59.157
Used it to cut a deal, but he didn't.

20:00.617 --> 20:03.328
Did your IA contact
give you anything else?

20:03.495 --> 20:05.664
The witness has agreed
to swear out a statement.

20:05.831 --> 20:08.333
IA has officially
reopened the investigation.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.377
You are now the primary suspect

20:10.961 --> 20:13.589
in the murder of Theo Galavan.

20:20.137 --> 20:22.264
Well, tell my uncle to call me!

20:25.100 --> 20:27.269
Look, I know you think
he's got a soft spot for you,

20:27.436 --> 20:30.689
but I'm pretty sure that's gonna change
when he finds out you tried to rob him.

20:31.106 --> 20:33.525
My guess is he's not gonna be
too happy with you, either,

20:34.443 --> 20:38.155
when I tell him that I just waltzed
in here and grabbed the cash.

20:38.488 --> 20:42.576
So, maybe you let us go,
and we call it even?

20:44.328 --> 20:45.913
What kind of message would that send?

20:46.330 --> 20:49.666
No. The Gilzeans
are all about consequences.

20:49.833 --> 20:51.335
More like all about pizza.

20:55.964 --> 20:57.341
You ever try our product, Selina?

20:57.507 --> 20:58.634
Stop!

20:59.217 --> 21:00.719
Aren't you being rather cowardly?

21:01.345 --> 21:02.638
Assaulting a girl?

21:05.515 --> 21:08.185
No, he's right. You know,
when you're right, you're right!

21:09.645 --> 21:11.229
Knock it off, Sonny. You made your point.

21:11.521 --> 21:12.856
Stay out of this, Selina.

21:14.524 --> 21:16.068
Call me a coward again.

21:16.360 --> 21:17.611
You're a coward.

21:20.739 --> 21:22.699
An ignorant, brutish--

21:24.534 --> 21:25.577
Stop!

21:25.744 --> 21:29.206
While you're down there, kid,
lick my boot.

21:33.377 --> 21:35.379
<i>Strength costs wind.</i>

21:36.046 --> 21:40.425
<i>Now, if you're gonna beat a big man,
all you have to do is outlast him.</i>

21:52.145 --> 21:53.188
Stop!

22:03.657 --> 22:05.784
I actually think he wants a beating.

22:05.951 --> 22:07.744
Is that your thing, kid?

22:07.911 --> 22:09.204
You like pain?

22:11.873 --> 22:16.211
An ignorant, brutish, cowardly clown.

22:16.628 --> 22:18.046
Yep.

22:18.213 --> 22:19.256
He likes it, all right.

22:20.424 --> 22:22.592
Your mom and dad
must have been real freaks,

22:22.759 --> 22:24.886
bringing up a weird kid like you.

22:25.262 --> 22:26.430
Enough!

22:33.103 --> 22:34.938
Let's go! Let's go!

22:49.453 --> 22:50.537
Hello, Mother.

22:54.708 --> 22:56.251
What a lovely spot.

22:58.754 --> 23:01.465
I'm so sorry I couldn't be here
for the funeral,

23:03.550 --> 23:05.385
but I think you'd be proud of me.

23:07.095 --> 23:08.638
I'm a changed man.

23:09.681 --> 23:10.724
Or,

23:11.808 --> 23:13.101
at least I'm trying to be.

23:14.978 --> 23:16.021
To be honest,

23:17.647 --> 23:19.608
I don't know

23:19.858 --> 23:21.193
if I'm gonna make it without you.

23:24.946 --> 23:25.989
Hello?

23:28.492 --> 23:29.493
<i>I'm terribly sorry,</i>

23:29.659 --> 23:31.620
- I don't mean to interrupt.
- Not at all.

23:33.914 --> 23:36.374
- Lilies.
- Her favorite, if memory serves.

23:36.541 --> 23:37.667
Yes. They were.

23:38.585 --> 23:39.669
Did you know her?

23:41.630 --> 23:42.923
A long time ago.

23:43.173 --> 23:46.051
I found her again only in death,
I'm afraid.

23:46.885 --> 23:48.637
- I'm Elijah Van Dahl.
- Oh.

23:48.804 --> 23:50.013
Oswald Cobblepot.

23:51.848 --> 23:52.974
Cobblepot?

23:53.266 --> 23:54.726
You're related to Gertrude?

23:54.893 --> 23:56.061
My mother.

23:57.687 --> 23:59.272
Mother?

24:01.608 --> 24:02.776
You're Gertrude's son?

24:02.943 --> 24:04.027
Yes.

24:05.195 --> 24:07.030
I'm sorry. How did you know
my mother, exactly?

24:07.197 --> 24:08.907
- How old are you?
- Excuse me?

24:09.074 --> 24:10.784
How old are you?

24:11.076 --> 24:12.619
- Gertrude left--
- Thirty-one.

24:12.911 --> 24:14.663
Thirty-one years ago, yes.

24:14.830 --> 24:15.872
That's right.

24:17.290 --> 24:18.542
Oh, my God. She...

24:21.044 --> 24:22.337
She never told me.

24:23.505 --> 24:24.881
Told you what?

24:26.341 --> 24:27.717
That I had a son.

24:42.774 --> 24:44.151
Any word on the bomber?

24:46.611 --> 24:48.029
Bullock's waiting on forensics.

24:50.157 --> 24:52.159
I just wish I knew what his endgame was.

24:52.325 --> 24:53.910
Feels like I'm missing something.

24:55.537 --> 24:57.414
Is that why you're not eating?

25:00.125 --> 25:01.334
Uh, yeah, I guess.

25:05.589 --> 25:06.965
No.

25:09.176 --> 25:12.971
IA is re-opening the investigation
into Galavan's murder.

25:13.847 --> 25:16.224
- Why?
- An eye-witness came forward.

25:18.185 --> 25:20.979
You... You told me it was over, Jim.

25:21.146 --> 25:22.230
You swore to me.

25:22.397 --> 25:23.648
I'm sorry.

25:26.401 --> 25:27.903
I knew in my heart that it wasn't.

25:28.069 --> 25:29.070
<i>But I let you lie to me.</i>

25:30.238 --> 25:31.281
I didn't. I wasn't.

25:31.448 --> 25:32.532
We should have left
when we had the chance.

25:32.699 --> 25:35.160
Gone somewhere new, somewhere better,
somewhere fit to raise our child.

25:35.327 --> 25:37.454
You knew I couldn't do that.

25:37.746 --> 25:38.872
I can fix this.

25:39.039 --> 25:40.081
How?

25:41.625 --> 25:43.960
You did it. You killed Galavan.

25:44.961 --> 25:47.464
I'll find a way. I have to.

25:47.797 --> 25:48.924
What if you can't?

26:01.728 --> 26:02.729
Hello, Officer Pinkney.

26:03.897 --> 26:05.774
I'm so sorry to bother you at home.
Can I come in?

26:06.816 --> 26:08.735
Uh, sure.

26:08.902 --> 26:10.320
Make it quick. The ballgame's on.

26:12.948 --> 26:14.532
What's this about?

26:14.699 --> 26:17.160
Oh, Detective Gordon'll explain.
He's just behind me.

26:17.327 --> 26:18.328
Oh, okay.

26:19.621 --> 26:21.164
Hey, Pinkney,

26:21.331 --> 26:23.083
what do you call a tavern of blackbirds?

26:24.209 --> 26:26.795
A crowbar.

26:27.087 --> 26:29.256
You get it? A crow bar.

26:29.422 --> 26:30.507
I know it's kind of lame.

26:30.674 --> 26:32.050
I just came up with it on the spot.

26:32.801 --> 26:33.802
Ow.

27:13.925 --> 27:16.261
Gertrude came to work
as a cook for my parents.

27:16.469 --> 27:18.263
She was so young and beautiful.

27:19.180 --> 27:20.265
So full of life.

27:21.766 --> 27:22.892
So beautiful.

27:26.229 --> 27:27.856
I was young then, too.

27:28.273 --> 27:29.399
A boy, really.

27:31.318 --> 27:33.570
A foolish, romantic boy.

27:40.910 --> 27:42.579
When my parents found out,

27:43.705 --> 27:46.082
they forbade us from being together.

27:46.249 --> 27:48.501
I was the heir to a great fortune,
they said.

27:48.668 --> 27:50.211
And she was just a cook.

27:51.421 --> 27:52.672
I threatened to run away with her.

27:53.548 --> 27:57.927
Turn my back on my family name
and my inheritance.

27:58.094 --> 28:01.056
It was the first and only time
I ever stood up to them.

28:01.681 --> 28:04.392
<i>They must have known
my words were just that.</i>

28:04.559 --> 28:08.021
A spoiled child, making idle threats.

28:08.188 --> 28:09.898
<i>The next day, Gertrude was gone.</i>

28:11.399 --> 28:15.820
My parents told me only that
they had come to an arrangement.

28:15.987 --> 28:17.447
She would be taken care of,

28:17.614 --> 28:21.284
and I must never make
an attempt to find her.

28:23.620 --> 28:25.288
And to my shame, I didn't.

28:28.291 --> 28:29.793
I let them separate us.

28:30.460 --> 28:31.795
I had no idea...

28:32.921 --> 28:34.672
She never told me she was pregnant.

28:36.966 --> 28:38.468
She didn't tell me about you...

28:40.136 --> 28:41.721
If she did...

28:41.888 --> 28:44.974
She told me that my father had died
when I was still a baby.

28:46.851 --> 28:48.895
Easier than the truth, I suppose.

28:49.604 --> 28:53.316
That your father was a coward
who wouldn't stand up to his parents.

28:53.483 --> 28:57.904
She must have figured that the two of you
would be better off making your own way.

29:00.448 --> 29:02.409
Which, in fact, is probably the truth.

29:04.285 --> 29:05.453
Look at you.

29:07.497 --> 29:09.374
A strong young man.

29:11.167 --> 29:12.460
She did a good job, didn't she?

29:13.670 --> 29:15.296
She tried.

29:16.339 --> 29:17.799
We both miss her terribly.

29:19.759 --> 29:20.802
My poor boy,

29:22.679 --> 29:24.139
you've been all alone in the world.

29:28.143 --> 29:30.353
Yes, I have.

29:31.354 --> 29:32.397
No longer.

29:33.606 --> 29:34.607
You have a home,

29:36.067 --> 29:37.402
and a father,

29:38.027 --> 29:39.863
and a family.

29:42.031 --> 29:44.451
- A family?
- A big, happy family.

29:45.827 --> 29:48.496
They're going to be
so thrilled to meet you.

29:50.415 --> 29:52.041
Sir, please,

29:52.876 --> 29:54.335
tell me truthfully,

29:54.752 --> 29:56.379
is this a dream?

29:59.632 --> 30:01.009
It's not a dream, my boy.

30:01.759 --> 30:02.802
You're home.

30:29.787 --> 30:31.873
- Yeah.
<i>- Forensics just landed.</i>

30:32.040 --> 30:35.418
The timer on the bomb was activated
remotely by phone, which was smart.

30:35.585 --> 30:38.505
Gave him time to plant it in advance
and set it off when he wanted.

30:39.297 --> 30:40.340
<i>We get a number?</i>

30:40.507 --> 30:45.553
Yeah. Call came from a payphone
inside 17, West Dewy Avenue.

30:45.720 --> 30:47.805
<i>Just a few blocks from Union Station.</i>

30:47.972 --> 30:49.057
Payphone, huh?

30:50.099 --> 30:51.434
All right, I'll go over there
and check it out.

30:51.601 --> 30:53.895
<i>- See you tomorrow.</i>
- He's probably long gone by now.

30:54.687 --> 30:56.105
I can't sleep anyhow.

30:56.272 --> 30:57.315
<i>Yeah.</i>

31:18.461 --> 31:19.587
Hello?

31:22.382 --> 31:23.466
Hello?

31:37.230 --> 31:38.314
Pinkney.

31:47.073 --> 31:48.116
Gordon?

31:48.658 --> 31:49.659
What the hell are you doing here?

31:52.829 --> 31:54.539
Put your gun down. Now!

31:59.752 --> 32:01.838
Place your gun on the floor.

32:02.005 --> 32:03.631
I won't say it again.

32:04.048 --> 32:05.133
Okay.

32:09.679 --> 32:11.097
Listen to me.

32:11.598 --> 32:14.017
I was just following up a lead
on the bomber investigation.

32:14.183 --> 32:16.936
You were following up a lead
in Pinkney's apartment?

32:17.520 --> 32:19.022
No.

32:19.188 --> 32:21.399
I didn't know that
this was Pinkney's apartment building.

32:22.984 --> 32:24.277
Why are you here?

32:25.236 --> 32:26.779
Pinkney sent me a message.

32:27.530 --> 32:29.282
Wanted to talk outside of work.

32:29.949 --> 32:30.950
About what?

32:31.534 --> 32:32.744
You.

32:35.913 --> 32:38.249
I have to have to take you down
to the precinct.

32:42.629 --> 32:43.630
There's been a mistake.

32:45.131 --> 32:46.424
I hope so, son.

32:47.717 --> 32:48.760
I hope so.

32:59.228 --> 33:01.147
Almost done.

33:03.941 --> 33:05.068
Okay.

33:11.908 --> 33:15.536
Never seen someone
take a beating like that before.

33:17.246 --> 33:19.082
I think Sonny's right.

33:19.248 --> 33:20.833
You do like pain.

33:26.673 --> 33:28.091
When it was happening,

33:32.387 --> 33:34.222
it was like nothing else existed.

33:38.434 --> 33:41.896
Everything I've been struggling with,

33:42.397 --> 33:43.648
the emptiness

33:46.275 --> 33:47.610
and confusion,

33:51.656 --> 33:52.865
it just vanished,

33:54.158 --> 33:56.160
and for the first time

33:57.829 --> 33:59.163
in a long time,

34:00.331 --> 34:02.291
I knew I was going to be okay.

34:05.378 --> 34:07.797
I knew that whatever Sonny did to me,

34:10.550 --> 34:12.135
I could take it.

34:16.889 --> 34:19.183
That he couldn't break me.

34:21.310 --> 34:23.229
That no one can.

34:26.566 --> 34:28.568
Nobody's unbreakable, Bruce.

34:45.877 --> 34:46.919
You want your rep here?

34:47.086 --> 34:48.713
I didn't do this. Somebody set me up.

34:48.880 --> 34:51.424
Cause of death,
blunt force trauma to the head.

34:51.591 --> 34:52.633
Captain, listen to me. I--

34:52.800 --> 34:54.051
Murder weapon was a crowbar.

34:54.343 --> 34:55.553
We found it under the couch.

34:57.764 --> 34:59.140
Your fingerprints were on it.

35:04.437 --> 35:07.106
<i>At Union Station,
I used a crowbar to open up the locker.</i>

35:07.523 --> 35:08.858
Somebody must have picked it up.

35:10.777 --> 35:12.069
And that someone just happened to know

35:12.236 --> 35:14.197
that you'd be paying
Officer Pinkney a visit tonight?

35:14.363 --> 35:16.699
I told you.
I didn't know that he lived there.

35:16.866 --> 35:19.994
Forensics traced the bomber's call
to a pay phone in the building.

35:20.161 --> 35:21.245
Bullock will back me up.

35:21.412 --> 35:22.663
He did.

35:23.331 --> 35:25.082
<i>But when I asked for the report,</i>

35:25.500 --> 35:28.795
it had nothing to do with a remote timer
or any traced call.

35:37.386 --> 35:39.263
I know how this looks.

35:40.181 --> 35:42.391
But Pinkney was one of us.
Why would I kill him?

35:42.934 --> 35:45.520
Because he was the anonymous witness
that fingered you.

35:46.437 --> 35:51.192
We found this Internal Affairs form
at Pinkney's place.

35:51.943 --> 35:55.780
It's the exact same statement
that the anonymous witness made,

35:55.947 --> 35:58.574
only Pinkney signed this
with his own name.

35:59.116 --> 36:01.994
<i>I guess he got cold feet
about putting himself on the line.</i>

36:02.161 --> 36:04.497
<i>So he sent in the anonymous tip instead.</i>

36:05.331 --> 36:07.208
Must have figured you'd get nasty.

36:07.667 --> 36:09.335
I don't know how you figured it out,

36:09.502 --> 36:11.629
but you found out he was the witness.

36:11.796 --> 36:12.839
No.

36:13.005 --> 36:14.549
Maybe you went over to his place
to talk him out of it?

36:14.715 --> 36:16.050
I told you,
I didn't know it was his place!

36:16.217 --> 36:19.178
Or maybe you had no intention of talking,
and you just killed him.

36:20.096 --> 36:21.138
You know me.

36:21.889 --> 36:24.475
I know that something went down
between you and Galavan that night.

36:24.642 --> 36:27.061
I saw it in your eyes
when IA was grilling you.

36:27.228 --> 36:30.481
And now, the one person who was about
to shine light on this whole thing

36:30.648 --> 36:33.484
is found beaten to death
with you standing over the body.

36:33.693 --> 36:35.653
- What am I missing?
- I was set up!

36:35.820 --> 36:40.783
Jim, how many lying,
son-of-a-bitch, low-life weasels

36:40.950 --> 36:42.493
have you heard use that same line?

36:42.660 --> 36:43.744
Somebody set you up?

36:43.911 --> 36:45.621
That's what you're going with?

36:47.665 --> 36:50.334
The least you can do
is admit what you did.

36:50.501 --> 36:51.711
Be a man.

36:53.379 --> 36:54.422
Pinkney was one of us.

36:54.922 --> 36:57.383
He deserves that. I deserve that!

36:57.550 --> 36:59.051
The least you could do
is look me in the eye

36:59.552 --> 37:02.263
and remind me that
you were a good cop once.

37:02.430 --> 37:05.725
That you still know right from wrong. Jim!

37:09.145 --> 37:10.855
I want to talk to my rep.

37:14.191 --> 37:16.944
You're a disgrace to the badge.

37:17.111 --> 37:18.321
I trusted you!

37:20.197 --> 37:22.325
But you broke my heart.

37:29.040 --> 37:31.083
You, take him to county.

37:32.001 --> 37:33.669
I don't want him here.

37:39.717 --> 37:41.510
- Jim!
- Harvey.

37:42.261 --> 37:43.262
The bomber, Harvey.

37:43.554 --> 37:46.057
Everything that happened today
was set up to trap me!

37:47.642 --> 37:49.352
<i>The bomber, Harvey!</i>

37:56.943 --> 37:59.028
<i>The four-week
murder trial of Detective Gordon</i>

37:59.195 --> 38:01.322
<i>concluded just minutes ago,</i>

38:01.489 --> 38:04.408
<i>with the jury returning
a unanimous verdict of "guilty."</i>

38:04.575 --> 38:07.328
<i>The judge handed down
the maximum sentence of 40 years</i>

38:07.495 --> 38:09.205
<i>to be served at Blackgate Penitentiary.</i>

38:16.170 --> 38:20.716
<i>...jury was unanimous in its decision
after deliberating less than 24 hours.</i>

38:20.883 --> 38:23.678
<i>District Attorney Harvey Dent
was not available for comment--</i>

38:23.844 --> 38:24.845
Wow.

38:28.140 --> 38:29.225
You okay?

38:29.934 --> 38:31.394
This isn't right.

38:33.562 --> 38:34.772
This can't be right.

38:35.564 --> 38:37.066
Tell me something that is.

38:43.531 --> 38:47.576
<i>Just hours ago, the murder
trial of Detective James Gordon concluded</i>

38:47.743 --> 38:52.039
<i>with the jury returning
a unanimous verdict of "guilty."</i>

38:52.206 --> 38:55.251
<i>The judge handed down
the maximum sentence of 40 years</i>

38:55.418 --> 38:58.587
<i>to be served at Blackgate Penitentiary.</i>

38:58.754 --> 39:01.298
<i>The jury was unanimous in its decision--</i>

39:01.465 --> 39:03.592
Oh, my. Awake at last.

39:10.224 --> 39:13.144
Well, hello, dear.

39:13.936 --> 39:15.730
Someone call Professor Strange!

39:23.738 --> 39:25.906
We're gonna fight this.

39:29.118 --> 39:30.161
- Lee.
- Did you hear me?

39:30.327 --> 39:31.704
No matter what it takes,
we're gonna fight this.

39:31.871 --> 39:33.205
The evidence isn't gonna change.

39:33.372 --> 39:34.415
You're innocent.

39:34.707 --> 39:36.625
I'm far from innocent. We both know that.

39:36.792 --> 39:38.836
So, what? We just give up?

39:41.297 --> 39:42.423
We move on.

39:43.799 --> 39:44.925
Move on?

39:45.968 --> 39:47.511
Move on to what?

39:50.389 --> 39:52.141
You mean me.

39:52.308 --> 39:53.934
You mean I move on.

39:54.602 --> 39:56.228
I've thought long and hard about this.

39:56.395 --> 39:58.105
- No.
- You have to listen to me.

39:58.272 --> 39:59.315
I'm tired of listening.

39:59.482 --> 40:00.816
This isn't fair!

40:03.110 --> 40:05.112
How can you not be with us?

40:08.824 --> 40:10.034
Birthdays,

40:11.494 --> 40:13.496
and first steps,

40:13.662 --> 40:15.581
and skinned knees,

40:16.874 --> 40:18.125
and everything?

40:21.087 --> 40:23.547
What, what? Visits through bars and...

40:23.839 --> 40:25.716
And not knowing
when the phone is gonna ring

40:25.883 --> 40:27.760
in the middle of the night
and tell me when you're--

40:28.010 --> 40:29.095
I don't want that.

40:29.261 --> 40:30.638
For either of you.

40:30.805 --> 40:33.307
- You still have a chance at happiness.
- No.

40:33.474 --> 40:35.101
You need to go somewhere.

40:35.851 --> 40:37.061
Far away from here.

40:37.228 --> 40:39.146
Somewhere fit to raise our child.

40:39.522 --> 40:40.731
Start a new life.

40:42.399 --> 40:43.526
Forget I exist.

40:44.318 --> 40:45.861
It's the only way
either one of us survives this.

40:46.028 --> 40:47.446
No, Jim.

40:49.698 --> 40:52.827
Don't try to contact me again.
I won't reply.

40:52.993 --> 40:55.621
No. Don't do this.

40:55.955 --> 40:57.039
I'm sorry, Lee.

40:57.206 --> 40:58.541
Jim, don't do this. I love you.

40:58.707 --> 40:59.959
I'm so, so sorry.

41:00.209 --> 41:01.544
Jim!

41:09.009 --> 41:10.177
<i>A toast.</i>

41:10.719 --> 41:12.805
I want to thank you all
for your generosity.

41:13.055 --> 41:17.726
You have welcomed Oswald into our family
with open arms and open hearts,

41:17.893 --> 41:20.896
and for that, I am truly blessed.

41:23.399 --> 41:24.650
To family.

41:25.192 --> 41:29.071
Uh, you guys have made me

41:29.238 --> 41:31.490
the happiest man on the planet.

41:31.657 --> 41:33.826
I am so grateful.

41:35.452 --> 41:37.413
I love you all.

41:38.664 --> 41:40.749
- Family.
- To family.

41:40.916 --> 41:42.293
To family.

41:48.549 --> 41:49.633
Oh...

41:51.719 --> 41:53.637
- Brother.
- Yes, yes.

41:54.847 --> 41:56.140
Yes.

42:08.652 --> 42:11.614
<i>Inmate Gordon,
prison transfer. Open the gate.</i>

42:27.713 --> 42:29.256
I'm gonna find who set you up.

42:30.633 --> 42:32.009
This ain't over.

42:33.427 --> 42:34.678
Yeah.

42:50.945 --> 42:52.780
You were a good partner, Harvey.

42:53.155 --> 42:54.240
Still am.

43:47.835 --> 43:48.877
English - SDH
