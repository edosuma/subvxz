You were abducted from your home
the night of September 3, 1958.

01:18:15.657 --> 01:18:16.863
I'm Kristen.

01:18:17.784 --> 01:18:18.819
Not Alice.

01:18:18.827 --> 01:18:20.442
I'm Kristen.

01:18:20.454 --> 01:18:23.821
You were left chained up in the basement
of an abandoned farmhouse

01:18:23.832 --> 01:18:25.163
for nearly two months,

01:18:26.001 --> 01:18:29.084
the same farmhouse you burned down.

01:18:31.006 --> 01:18:33.042
You were only 11 years old,

01:18:33.050 --> 01:18:36.793
half-starved, sick with fever,
trapped in the darkness.

01:18:37.262 --> 01:18:39.002
It was a waking nightmare.

01:18:39.556 --> 01:18:43.299
Your only escape was into delusion.

01:18:44.478 --> 01:18:48.471
In order to survive the trauma,
your psyche fractured.

01:18:51.652 --> 01:18:54.689
You suffer from multiple
personality disorder.

01:18:57.616 --> 01:19:00.107
Each personality

01:19:00.494 --> 01:19:04.658
took a piece of this nightmare
and locked it away from you

01:19:04.665 --> 01:19:05.780
for your own protection.

01:19:07.709 --> 01:19:12.043
But the new personalities
became so dominant,

01:19:12.047 --> 01:19:15.289
they completely overwhelmed
Alice's own personality.

01:19:19.304 --> 01:19:22.341
I know it hasn't been pleasant,

01:19:22.349 --> 01:19:25.386
but my techniques are helping you.

01:19:26.019 --> 01:19:27.600
After several years of therapy,

01:19:27.604 --> 01:19:30.471
we've been able to isolate
your different identities.

01:19:30.482 --> 01:19:32.347
We'd just begun to single them out

01:19:32.359 --> 01:19:36.648
and eliminate them through
some experimental techniques

01:19:36.655 --> 01:19:38.395
when you, Kristen, appeared.

01:19:43.078 --> 01:19:45.410
I didn't just appear!

01:19:45.414 --> 01:19:47.029
Your psyche invented Kristen

01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:50.373
to protect itself
from having to relive this trauma.

01:19:51.253 --> 01:19:53.585
[TICK-TICK TICK-TICK]

01:20:09.313 --> 01:20:12.055
And now it's time to say goodbye.

01:20:22.743 --> 01:20:24.279
Please don't kill me.

01:20:24.286 --> 01:20:26.447
[ROARING]

01:20:40.552 --> 01:20:42.543
Don't move. Don't move.

01:20:48.769 --> 01:20:50.885
She's the last one who got out.

01:20:52.064 --> 01:20:53.429
What did you say?

01:20:54.441 --> 01:20:58.525
DR. STRINGER: Iris, you know we don't
discuss people who aren't present.

01:20:59.571 --> 01:21:01.311
She can't remember the rules.

01:21:01.698 --> 01:21:04.280
Because she's the crazy one
around here, you know.

01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:05.945
MAN: That's enough.

01:21:14.378 --> 01:21:15.663
Is she cured?

01:21:17.047 --> 01:21:19.629
She'll probably need a lifetime of therapy,

01:21:19.633 --> 01:21:21.999
but she's no longer a danger to herself.

01:21:22.886 --> 01:21:27.971
She is, essentially, your daughter again.

01:21:29.142 --> 01:21:30.473
Can we please see her now?

01:21:34.856 --> 01:21:35.936
MOTHER: Alice?

01:21:42.864 --> 01:21:44.525
Honey, you okay?

01:21:47.244 --> 01:21:48.950
We love you, sweetheart.

01:21:51.331 --> 01:21:54.038
Mom? Dad?

01:21:54.918 --> 01:21:56.158
Oh, honey.

01:22:06.221 --> 01:22:10.055
I figured you'd want your things around you.

01:22:16.815 --> 01:22:19.022
And I put this one back together
for you, too.

01:22:23.113 --> 01:22:24.102
Thank you.

01:22:40.213 --> 01:22:41.498
I think I remember.

01:22:42.257 --> 01:22:43.497
What do you remember?

01:22:45.093 --> 01:22:46.458
Everything.

01:22:48.513 --> 01:22:50.049
The old farmhouse.

01:22:51.099 --> 01:22:52.259
This place.

01:22:52.768 --> 01:22:53.723
The others.

01:22:54.895 --> 01:22:57.386
Emily. Sarah. Iris.

01:22:58.690 --> 01:22:59.930
Kristen.

01:23:01.109 --> 01:23:03.065
You can forget all about them now.

01:23:05.071 --> 01:23:06.527
When can I get out of here?

01:23:06.531 --> 01:23:08.522
I really... I just want to go home.

01:23:08.533 --> 01:23:12.651
Dr. Stringer says two, maybe three days.

01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:15.616
I think that's enough visiting for today.

01:23:16.124 --> 01:23:17.660
We'll let you get some rest.

01:23:17.667 --> 01:23:19.532
Couldn't we stay just a little bit longer?

01:23:19.544 --> 01:23:21.830
You'll have her all to yourself in no time.

01:24:28.363 --> 01:24:30.775
