WEBVTT

00:01.501 --> 00:02.068
This is the Evergreen

00:02.068 --> 00:04.637
This is the
Evergreen forest.

00:04.637 --> 00:06.673
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:08.341 --> 00:11.177
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:11.177 --> 00:12.779
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:14.447 --> 00:16.116
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:17.083 --> 00:18.284
Yikes!

00:18.718 --> 00:20.653
Yaaaah...

00:22.856 --> 00:24.324
Yeaaaah!

00:24.324 --> 00:27.327
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:34.768 --> 00:37.370
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:38.638 --> 00:40.006
Cyril Sneer!

00:43.543 --> 00:46.046
And his life would be simple
except for...

00:46.679 --> 00:48.381
the Raccoons!!

00:48.381 --> 00:50.817
♪ (show theme music) ♪

00:57.924 --> 00:58.558
On a clear summer night

00:58.558 --> 01:00.760
On a clear summer
night in the Evergreen forest,

01:00.760 --> 01:03.897
you can almost reach out
and touch the stars.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.399
And on nights like
these Bert Raccoon

01:06.399 --> 01:08.201
and his best friend Cedric

01:08.201 --> 01:10.703
make sure they have
front row seats,

01:10.703 --> 01:13.473
because you never know when you
will have a chance

01:13.473 --> 01:15.341
to catch a falling star.

01:16.543 --> 01:17.911
It's started, Bert?

01:17.911 --> 01:22.549
Oh boy, Cedric,
will you look at that!

01:22.549 --> 01:23.716
Wow!

01:23.716 --> 01:27.720
Boy, I've never
seen so many meteorites!

01:27.720 --> 01:30.523
Well actually, Bert,
those are meteors.

01:30.523 --> 01:32.525
It's only when
they hit the Earth

01:32.525 --> 01:35.061
that they are called meteorites.

01:35.061 --> 01:36.729
Right, right.

01:36.729 --> 01:40.567
Anyway, this meteor
shower happens every August

01:40.567 --> 01:42.869
and all the meteors
seem to come

01:42.869 --> 01:46.539
from that
constellation, Perseus.

01:46.539 --> 01:48.208
Cedric,
did you ever wonder,

01:48.208 --> 01:51.411
if there is anyone up there
looking down at our planet and

01:51.411 --> 01:54.547
wondering, if there is anyone
down here looking back up?

01:54.547 --> 01:57.584
All the time Bert.

01:57.584 --> 02:00.954
Cedric/Bert: Oooh!

02:00.954 --> 02:03.089
Just think
of all the exploring

02:03.089 --> 02:04.757
there is to do out there.

02:04.757 --> 02:07.727
One day, we will boldly go

02:07.727 --> 02:11.531
and take one giant step.

02:11.531 --> 02:13.633
Ahhh! Wow!

02:15.068 --> 02:17.737
Wow!!! Look at that!

02:17.737 --> 02:18.805
Wow!

02:18.805 --> 02:20.773
Cedric, it's going to hit!

02:20.773 --> 02:23.843
It's a going to be a meteorite!

02:23.843 --> 02:25.812
Wow!

02:25.812 --> 02:30.350
A meteorite just landed
on Jack Pine Island.

02:30.350 --> 02:32.085
Wow!

02:34.654 --> 02:38.458
No, certainly not, Knox.
No hard feelings.

02:38.458 --> 02:42.462
Yes, I'd be happy to attend
your little celebration.

02:42.462 --> 02:43.963
Goodbye, my friend.

02:43.963 --> 02:48.968
Why that back-stabbing double-
dealing Knox has done it again!

02:48.968 --> 02:52.472
That's the third time this week
he's beaten me out on a deal!

02:52.472 --> 02:56.276
It's almost as if he's got
inside information.

02:56.276 --> 02:57.777
Not from us, boss.

02:57.777 --> 03:00.914
Well, find out, where
he does get his information.

03:00.914 --> 03:02.649
Right away, Sir.

03:03.449 --> 03:06.286
Pig 2: Don't worry
about a thing, boss.

03:06.286 --> 03:08.254
We are on the job.

03:08.254 --> 03:10.256
I always worry
when you three

03:10.256 --> 03:12.659
dim-witted disasters
are on the job.

03:14.127 --> 03:16.162
Do you think
they'll name the meteorite

03:16.162 --> 03:18.131
after us, Cedric?

03:18.131 --> 03:21.201
The Bert and Cedric meteorite.

03:21.201 --> 03:24.837
Oh, it's got kind of a
ring to it, doesn't it?

03:24.837 --> 03:26.139
You said it, Bert!

03:26.773 --> 03:28.608
But I still think
we oughta tell

03:28.608 --> 03:32.312
Professor Smedley-Smythe
about it. He is an expert.

03:32.312 --> 03:34.347
Are you crazy, Cedric?

03:34.347 --> 03:36.316
We can't tell anyone yet.

03:36.316 --> 03:40.753
We are going to be the first
ones to find that meteorite!

03:42.555 --> 03:45.158
So it's got to be
our secret for now.

03:45.158 --> 03:47.360
Well, at least
let's tell someone

03:47.360 --> 03:48.628
where we are going.

03:48.628 --> 03:50.330
Just relax!

03:50.330 --> 03:51.898
We'll be back this afternoon

03:51.898 --> 03:53.866
and then we can tell
the whole world

03:53.866 --> 03:56.336
we found a meteorite!

03:56.336 --> 03:58.037
Hey, Bert!

03:58.771 --> 03:59.806
Ugh-uh!

04:01.674 --> 04:04.010
Avast me hearties!

04:04.010 --> 04:07.714
There's a fair wind blowing
towards Jack Pine Island.

04:07.714 --> 04:09.716
Riven up the misenshakes.

04:09.716 --> 04:11.384
Aye aye, captain.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.886
Professor Smedley-Smythe:
Yes, so you see,

04:13.886 --> 04:18.491
I need to find someone else,
who saw the meteorite.

04:18.491 --> 04:22.028
If I took a compass
bearing from here

04:22.028 --> 04:25.732
and someone else took a
compass bearing from here,

04:25.732 --> 04:29.135
then I would know the
meteorite landed here,

04:29.135 --> 04:30.870
where the two lines meet.

04:30.870 --> 04:34.173
It's called
triangulation, you see.

04:34.173 --> 04:36.009
We'll have this in
today's paper professor.

04:36.009 --> 04:39.078
Anyone seeing a bright
meteor in the skies

04:39.078 --> 04:41.314
over the Evergreen
forest last night,

04:41.314 --> 04:44.951
please contact Professor
Smedley-Smythe at the museum.

04:44.951 --> 04:48.221
Oh that's
absolutely top drawer, Ralph.

04:48.221 --> 04:51.124
I only hope someone
comes forward.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.860
You know,
Bert and Cedric were out

04:53.860 --> 04:55.595
star gazing last night.

04:55.595 --> 04:57.797
If you check back
this afternoon, Professor,

04:57.797 --> 04:59.132
Bert should be here.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.301
Lady Baden-Baden: Yoohoo!

05:01.301 --> 05:05.104
Here it is, Ralph, my
weekly astrology column.

05:05.104 --> 05:07.173
Mr. Knox: Ehm. Yes.

05:07.173 --> 05:12.245
How much longer do we
have to spy on Mr. Knox?

05:12.245 --> 05:14.614
Pig2: Until we find out
how he keeps

05:14.614 --> 05:16.916
beating the boss
to the big deal.

05:16.916 --> 05:19.886
Lady Baden-Baden: As a man of
science you must be fascinated

05:19.886 --> 05:22.155
by astrology, Professor?

05:22.155 --> 05:24.090
Ho-ho.

05:24.090 --> 05:27.960
Well, astrology
isn't exactly a science,

05:27.960 --> 05:30.296
Lady Baden-Baden.
Lady B-B: Oh nonsense!

05:30.296 --> 05:33.499
Just ask Knoxy, he'll
attest to its value.

05:33.499 --> 05:34.801
Uh, eh...

05:34.801 --> 05:37.770
Lady B-B: He's experienced a
profound increase in business

05:37.770 --> 05:41.574
since I began advising
him through astrology.

05:41.574 --> 05:43.176
Haven't you Knoxy?

05:43.176 --> 05:44.677
Mr. Knox: My dearest,

05:44.677 --> 05:48.281
I wouldn't make
a move without you.

05:48.281 --> 05:49.782
Hm-hm-hmmm.

05:49.782 --> 05:51.651
Lady B-B: Oh, Sweetness.

05:51.651 --> 05:53.753
Astrology!

05:53.753 --> 05:56.789
So that's the secret.

05:56.789 --> 05:59.125
Lady B-B: Well, we'd
love to stay and chat,

05:59.125 --> 06:00.493
but we must run.

06:00.493 --> 06:02.695
Come along, Knoxy, ta-taaa!

06:02.695 --> 06:06.632
Oh and don't forget about our
midsummer soire this evening.

06:06.632 --> 06:08.801
Everyone is invited!

06:09.836 --> 06:11.704
Bl-bl-bleah!

06:11.704 --> 06:15.441
Oh! Can't she ever
leave quietly!

06:15.441 --> 06:19.345
Pig 2: So Lady Baden-Baden
is advising Mr. Knox

06:19.345 --> 06:21.647
with astrology.

06:21.647 --> 06:25.051
Pig 3: That's the
secret to his success.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.854
In that case,
it looks like the boss

06:27.854 --> 06:31.324
is going to need an
astrologer to advise him!

06:31.324 --> 06:35.528
Or better yet, 3 astrologers!

06:35.528 --> 06:37.196
Pig 2: (giggles) Oh yes!

06:37.196 --> 06:41.734
All of a sudden,
our future looks brighter.

06:45.037 --> 06:48.674
Oh boy, Cedric! This
is going to be some fun!

06:50.877 --> 06:52.078
I don't know, Bert.

06:52.078 --> 06:55.181
Come on! We've
got a meteorite to find.

06:55.181 --> 06:56.783
Gee, Bert,

06:56.783 --> 06:59.452
I still think we
should've told somebody

06:59.452 --> 07:00.887
where we were going.

07:00.887 --> 07:04.824
Cedric, we are
about to become famous!

07:04.824 --> 07:07.727
How can you worry
at a time like this?

07:07.727 --> 07:11.030
I don't know.
I guess it just comes naturally.

07:11.030 --> 07:13.266
Hey, where
should we look, Cedric?

07:13.266 --> 07:15.668
This way or that?

07:15.668 --> 07:17.437
Maybe I should go up there, eh?

07:19.772 --> 07:21.240
I think we're ready.

07:21.240 --> 07:23.910
All we have to do now is
convince the boss

07:23.910 --> 07:27.146
we can foretell the future.

07:27.146 --> 07:29.048
Pig 2: Ooh, that's brilliant!

07:29.048 --> 07:33.119
Pig 3: Yeah, we might even
get a raise out of this.

07:34.554 --> 07:35.555
I'll get it.

07:37.290 --> 07:40.359
Sneer Enterprises,
how may I help you?

07:40.359 --> 07:41.928
Uhm.

07:41.928 --> 07:43.095
Well that's great.

07:43.095 --> 07:45.631
The boss will want
to hear that himself.

07:45.631 --> 07:48.701
Why don't you call
him back in about, um...

07:48.701 --> 07:51.070
two and one-half minutes.

07:52.238 --> 07:55.141
Oh boy! Get the
charts ready, quick!

07:55.141 --> 07:57.510
That was the boss' stock broker.

07:57.510 --> 07:59.779
Sneer's stocks just doubled

07:59.779 --> 08:03.349
and so did our chances of
impressing the boss.

08:03.349 --> 08:04.817
What's going on here,

08:04.817 --> 08:06.419
a druids convention?

08:06.419 --> 08:09.956
You simpering sausages are
supposed to be out there

08:09.956 --> 08:12.124
spying on Knox!

08:12.124 --> 08:14.894
We did, boss,
and we know the secret

08:14.894 --> 08:16.829
to his business success.

08:16.829 --> 08:18.998
Astrology!

08:18.998 --> 08:24.170
Honest boss, Knox uses
astrology to foresee the future.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.105
Well, you
three won't have one,

08:26.105 --> 08:28.908
if you don't start
talking sense.

08:28.908 --> 08:31.010
Pig 2: We'll do better
than that, Sir.

08:31.010 --> 08:33.679
We'll talk dollars and cents.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.649
For instance the stars say...

08:36.649 --> 08:39.318
Sneer stocks will double.

08:39.318 --> 08:40.686
Hogwash!

08:40.686 --> 08:42.555
Pig 3: And that'll be the phone.

08:42.555 --> 08:44.690
What a relief it is too.

08:44.690 --> 08:48.027
Sneer here, talk to me.
Talk sense to me!

08:48.027 --> 08:49.495
Uh!?

08:49.495 --> 08:51.464
Uhm! Really?

08:51.464 --> 08:53.199
That's remarkable.

08:53.199 --> 08:54.367
Ciao!

08:54.367 --> 08:57.970
Well boys, that
was my stock broker!

08:57.970 --> 09:01.173
Ha-Haa! Sneer
stocks just doubled!

09:02.975 --> 09:04.043
Oh, really?

09:04.043 --> 09:07.713
Pig 2: The stars know all.

09:07.713 --> 09:09.415
You, boys, are gifted.

09:09.415 --> 09:12.652
With you porkers plugged
into the astroplane,

09:12.652 --> 09:15.821
I can make a fortune,
the easy way.

09:17.490 --> 09:19.992
Looks like we'll need some
more room in the vault.

09:19.992 --> 09:21.494
Add on an extension.

09:21.494 --> 09:24.230
Yes, Sir. Oh, yes, Sir!

09:24.997 --> 09:27.800
A ha! I'm going
to make millions

09:27.800 --> 09:30.970
with those three curly
tailed clairvoyants.

09:30.970 --> 09:33.172
It worked!
For the first time,

09:33.172 --> 09:36.042
we've actually
impressed the boss.

09:36.042 --> 09:38.711
He'll believe anything
we tell him now.

09:43.015 --> 09:45.518
It's gotta be here
somewhere, Cedric.

09:45.518 --> 09:47.853
We better find it soon.

09:47.853 --> 09:51.791
It's getting late and I don't
want Pop to worry about me.

09:51.791 --> 09:54.594
And I don't want to miss
Lady Baden-Baden's party.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.496
I just love those
fancy little sandwiches.

09:57.496 --> 09:59.265
Maybe this will help.

09:59.265 --> 10:02.368
A compass?
We know where North is!

10:02.368 --> 10:03.736
That's right, Bert,

10:03.736 --> 10:07.740
but some meteorites are made of
highly magnetic nickel iron.

10:07.740 --> 10:09.875
Hey, it's working!

10:09.875 --> 10:12.745
The meteorite is deflecting
the compass needle.

10:12.745 --> 10:14.947
It's over that way!

10:14.947 --> 10:16.482
Well, what
are we waiting for?

10:16.482 --> 10:18.117
Let's go Cedric.

10:18.117 --> 10:19.652
Whoaaaaa!

10:19.652 --> 10:21.554
Ho-ha-oh!

10:21.554 --> 10:22.888
Are you all right, Bert?

10:22.888 --> 10:26.258
Cedric, we found it!

10:26.258 --> 10:28.394
Wow!

10:28.394 --> 10:29.929
Look at it, Cedric!

10:29.929 --> 10:31.631
W-we are famous!

10:31.631 --> 10:35.401
We-we found a rock
from outer space!

10:35.401 --> 10:38.537
Wow,
it's a beauty, Bert!

10:40.206 --> 10:42.742
Oh, wait'll we tell
Professor Smedley-Smythe.

10:42.742 --> 10:44.477
He'll be over the moon!

10:45.811 --> 10:47.580
Hmmm, now let me see.

10:53.219 --> 10:55.688
Come on,
I want to make some money!

10:55.688 --> 10:57.289
Start predicting!

10:57.289 --> 11:00.993
But boss, the stars
aren't, uh-oh-uhm...

11:00.993 --> 11:02.662
in proper alignment.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.331
Neither is your brain.
Now get on with it!

11:05.331 --> 11:06.465
Yes, Sir.

11:07.133 --> 11:11.637
Mmmmhhhmmmm...

11:11.637 --> 11:15.608
I feel it... I feel it!

11:15.608 --> 11:19.545
We are in touch
with a higher plain.

11:19.545 --> 11:23.683
What are your questions?

11:23.683 --> 11:25.985
Oh, the things
I do for money.

11:25.985 --> 11:28.654
All right, tell me
what's going to be hot

11:28.654 --> 11:30.322
in the commodities market.

11:30.322 --> 11:32.858
Mmmmhhhmmmm...

11:32.858 --> 11:35.594
Remind me to
pay the electric bill.

11:35.594 --> 11:41.300
I hear the
stars calling to me.

11:41.300 --> 11:43.169
I've got to get
that roof fixed too.

11:43.169 --> 11:46.839
The stars are calling.

11:46.839 --> 11:50.543
Caaaaalling,

11:50.543 --> 11:53.112
Caaaalliiiiing.

11:53.112 --> 11:54.980
You're going to be
calling an ambulance,

11:54.980 --> 11:57.683
if you don't make
a prediction pronto!

11:57.683 --> 11:58.951
R-r-right.

11:58.951 --> 12:02.321
Uhm, the stars say, uhm, oh yes.

12:02.321 --> 12:05.324
Buy...

12:05.324 --> 12:07.993
Can you be a
little more specific?

12:07.993 --> 12:10.830
B-buy. B-b-buy...

12:10.830 --> 12:16.035
Ooooh.. bananas.

12:16.035 --> 12:17.203
Cyril/Pigs: Bananas?

12:17.203 --> 12:22.241
Yes, boss, bananas.

12:22.241 --> 12:25.644
There is a big banana
bonanza boom coming, boss.

12:28.681 --> 12:35.087
The ancient voice of
the stars has spoken.

12:35.087 --> 12:38.424
Bananas it is then,
so get out there and buy!

12:38.424 --> 12:40.426
Buy boat loads! Buy plantations!

12:40.426 --> 12:41.827
Buy republics!

12:41.827 --> 12:44.997
Go bananas buying bananas, boys!

12:44.997 --> 12:48.400
He-he! That's a good one!
Write that down.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.536
Now, get out of those pajamas

12:50.536 --> 12:53.672
and get ready to drive me to
Lady Baden-Baden's party.

12:53.672 --> 12:56.776
I can't wait to gloat at Knox!

12:59.612 --> 13:01.447
Did you find it, Cedric?

13:01.447 --> 13:04.250
I've checked that whole
side of the island, Bert,

13:04.250 --> 13:06.552
and there is no
sign of the raft.

13:06.552 --> 13:09.588
Oh great,
that's just great!

13:09.588 --> 13:12.124
I should have tied
up the raft better!

13:13.058 --> 13:15.060
Now what are we going to do?

13:15.060 --> 13:16.295
Don't worry, Bert.

13:16.295 --> 13:18.964
Somebody will come
looking for us soon.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.733
Ya, maybe!

13:20.733 --> 13:23.702
But how are they going
to know where to look!?

13:24.236 --> 13:26.205
You were right, Cedric.

13:26.205 --> 13:28.941
We should have told someone
where we were going.

13:28.941 --> 13:33.078
It's going
to be a long night.

13:38.217 --> 13:38.884
Lady B-B: Oh, Lady Penelope Banyos,

13:38.884 --> 13:41.620
Lady B-B: Oh, Lady Penelope
Banyos, how do you do?

13:41.620 --> 13:43.055
How do you do?

13:43.055 --> 13:45.791
That's it!
They've been missing too long.

13:45.791 --> 13:47.560
I'm calling search and rescue.

13:47.560 --> 13:50.129
Lady B-B: You don't seem
to be enjoying my soire.

13:50.129 --> 13:51.831
Whatever is the matter?

13:51.831 --> 13:53.399
Cedric is missing.

13:53.399 --> 13:56.068
That ring-tailed
rapscallion Bert,

13:56.068 --> 13:59.171
he's behind this.
He's got them lost!

13:59.171 --> 14:01.240
We don't know
what's happened to them.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.609
They've never gone
off like this before.

14:03.609 --> 14:06.645
Lady B-B: It is
such a large forest.

14:06.645 --> 14:08.848
That's just it,
Lady Baden-Baden,

14:08.848 --> 14:11.016
where do we start
looking for them?

14:11.016 --> 14:14.286
Lady B-B: Wait there! I'll
get my astrological charts.

14:14.286 --> 14:17.957
Professor Smedley-Smythe: I'd
say jolly good party, Melissa.

14:17.957 --> 14:20.626
You haven't seen Bert, have you?

14:20.626 --> 14:23.095
I'm still looking for someone

14:23.095 --> 14:26.465
who might have seen
the meteor last night.

14:26.465 --> 14:28.434
That's it!
If Bert and Cedric

14:28.434 --> 14:30.302
did see that meteor last night,

14:30.302 --> 14:33.038
it would be just like
them to go looking for it.

14:33.038 --> 14:36.141
I've got a terrible feeling,
they are in real trouble.

14:36.141 --> 14:37.843
Lady B-B: Yoohoo! Here we are.

14:37.843 --> 14:42.448
Cedric's horoscope says to
rise above his problems.

14:42.448 --> 14:44.984
And according to
Bert's horoscope,

14:44.984 --> 14:47.620
he might find himself
in a high place.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.889
You mean the mountains?
Lady B-B: Yes.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.558
I don't put much stock in
horoscopes, Lady Baden-Baden,

14:52.558 --> 14:55.895
but I suppose it's as good a
place as any to start looking.

14:55.895 --> 14:59.832
Lady B-B: The stars
never lie, just ask Knoxy.

14:59.832 --> 15:01.667
Mr. Knox: Well, I..umm!

15:01.667 --> 15:03.702
Lady B-B: Gather round everyone.

15:03.702 --> 15:05.638
We must form search parties.

15:13.379 --> 15:14.847
Bert?

15:14.847 --> 15:17.082
Cedric?

15:17.082 --> 15:19.685
Broo?

15:19.685 --> 15:23.022
♪ I walk along
the empty streets ♪

15:23.022 --> 15:26.859

16:15.174 --> 16:16.408
What a night!

16:16.408 --> 16:19.445
I've never been
so c-cold in my l-life.

16:19.445 --> 16:23.248
See if you can get that
signal fire started, Cedric.

16:23.248 --> 16:24.984
Gee, Bert.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.419
I'll see if
I can spot anybody.

16:27.419 --> 16:30.155
They got to be
looking for us by now.

16:30.155 --> 16:33.993
I'll never get
this fire started, Broo.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.627
Oh boy!

16:35.627 --> 16:38.230
No sign of anyone, Cedric.

16:38.230 --> 16:39.298
Oww!

16:39.298 --> 16:41.500
Ah-ah-aaah-owww!

16:41.500 --> 16:42.634
Bert?

16:42.634 --> 16:46.005
Ohhh!
Bert! Bert, speak to me!

16:47.773 --> 16:49.942
W-What am I going to do?

16:49.942 --> 16:51.443
I gotta go for help.

16:51.443 --> 16:53.645
I gotta swim for it!

16:56.648 --> 16:58.817
Uh! This will help.

16:58.817 --> 17:01.520
Broo, watch out for Bert!

17:01.520 --> 17:04.356
I'll be back as soon as I can!

17:04.957 --> 17:07.259
Nothing? Nothing at all?

17:07.259 --> 17:09.695
And you've looked up
on Freen's Peak?

17:09.695 --> 17:12.331
We've checked
everywhere in the mountains.

17:12.331 --> 17:14.199
This isn't like Cedric at all.

17:14.199 --> 17:16.301
Lady B-B: I've made a new chart.

17:16.301 --> 17:18.037
I forgot to take into account

17:18.037 --> 17:21.607
the sign in the skies
two nights ago.

17:21.607 --> 17:23.108
So I think, we
should look up in the...

17:23.108 --> 17:25.677
Mr. Knox: Uhm, I don't think
consulting the charts

17:25.677 --> 17:27.846
will do any good, my sweet.

17:27.846 --> 17:28.947
Lady Baden-Baden: But Knoxy?

17:28.947 --> 17:32.184
You've always depended
on my charts to guide you.

17:32.184 --> 17:34.653
Mr. Knox: Well,
my dear, you see

17:34.653 --> 17:37.556
I've always made my
own business decisions.

17:37.556 --> 17:40.993
I couldn't hurt your feelings
by telling you that.

17:40.993 --> 17:44.229
Hmm, how interesting?

17:44.229 --> 17:45.330
Oooh!

17:45.964 --> 17:49.201
Wonderful, my son's
been out all night

17:49.201 --> 17:52.204
while we've been looking
in the wrong place.

17:52.204 --> 17:55.574
Lady B-B: Oh Cyril,
I thought...

17:55.574 --> 17:57.176
I thought, I was helping.

17:57.843 --> 18:00.479
No one is blaming
you, Lady Baden-Baden.

18:00.479 --> 18:02.881
The mountains were as good
a place to look as any!

18:02.881 --> 18:05.584
But where do we look for
Bert and Cedric now?

18:05.584 --> 18:08.087
It's a big forest out there.

18:09.254 --> 18:12.758
Ah, ah!

18:12.758 --> 18:16.361
Ah! (sighs) Eh!

18:17.362 --> 18:18.530
Ooh!

18:18.530 --> 18:20.699
Eeh!

18:20.699 --> 18:22.201
I see...

18:22.201 --> 18:24.169
Yes! Good luck.

18:25.270 --> 18:28.507
That was Search and Rescue.
Nothing to report.

18:28.507 --> 18:30.008
They'll keep looking, though.

18:30.008 --> 18:32.478
Professor Smedley-Smythe:
...and I just might know,

18:32.478 --> 18:34.079
where to look.

18:34.079 --> 18:36.915
What does this mean,
Lady Baden-Baden?

18:36.915 --> 18:40.719
Lady B-B: Oh, that.
That's the sign in the heavens.

18:40.719 --> 18:42.187
I saw it the other night.

18:42.187 --> 18:43.789
Professor Smedley-Smythe:
A bright fireball?

18:43.789 --> 18:44.923
Lady B-B: Yes.

18:44.923 --> 18:45.991
Professor Smedley-Smythe:
Oh! That's it.

18:45.991 --> 18:49.228
She's saw the meteor!

18:49.228 --> 18:51.930
You may have saved the
day, Lady Baden-Baden.

18:51.930 --> 18:55.267
You're observations
fill in the missing piece

18:55.267 --> 18:57.035
of the equation, you see.

18:57.035 --> 19:00.906
The meteor should
have landed here,

19:00.906 --> 19:02.975
Jack Pine Island.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.977
In that case we'd
better hope Bert and Cedric

19:04.977 --> 19:06.979
did go looking
for that meteorite.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.480
Well,
just don't stand there

19:08.480 --> 19:10.616
flapping your gums. Move it!

19:11.783 --> 19:13.986
Ooooh... Broo?

19:13.986 --> 19:17.122
Uuh, w-we-where is Cedric?

19:17.789 --> 19:21.426
It didn't
look that far to land.

19:21.426 --> 19:24.830
I've got to keep going.

19:24.830 --> 19:27.099
Can't you get any more
speed out of this

19:27.099 --> 19:29.134
oversized eggbeater?

19:29.134 --> 19:30.936
Cyril... down there!

19:32.804 --> 19:35.007
Keep flying,
I'm getting out here!

19:35.007 --> 19:37.009
You can't swim!

19:37.009 --> 19:39.444
Geronimoooooo!

19:44.816 --> 19:45.817
Ugh!

19:48.754 --> 19:52.090
Pop,
Bert is on the island.

19:52.090 --> 19:53.959
He, he's hurt!

19:53.959 --> 19:55.294
I've got him.

19:55.294 --> 19:58.597
Bert is on Jack Pine. Go!

20:02.267 --> 20:03.936
Are you all right, Pop?

20:03.936 --> 20:06.672
Fine son, but in future,

20:06.672 --> 20:09.308
let me know where you are going.

20:09.308 --> 20:13.011
I'm getting a little old
for this kind of thing.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.319
Bert!!!
Are you all right, Bert?

20:20.319 --> 20:23.188
Huh?... Hi guys!

20:23.188 --> 20:26.291
I guess I...
missed the party, huh?

20:26.291 --> 20:27.626
Oh, Bert!

20:29.294 --> 20:30.996
Explorers
on land and sea

20:30.996 --> 20:33.665
have always navigated
by the stars.

20:33.665 --> 20:35.667
Fortunately for Bert and Cedric,

20:35.667 --> 20:37.903
their friends had a falling star

20:37.903 --> 20:39.471
to guide the way.

20:39.471 --> 20:42.040
How about that,

20:42.040 --> 20:44.309
'The Bert and Cedric meteorite

20:44.309 --> 20:48.413
is going to be on permanent
display at the museum.'

20:48.413 --> 20:50.682
Ugh! Ah!

20:50.682 --> 20:53.485
Hi, Bert. I brought you
some bananas.

20:53.485 --> 20:54.886
No kidding!

20:54.886 --> 20:56.888
Hey, where did you get them all?

20:56.888 --> 20:59.925
Pop took a plunge
in the banana business.

21:00.692 --> 21:02.361
The bottom fell
out of the market

21:02.361 --> 21:05.664
and he's, he-he,
stuck with a few extra.

21:05.664 --> 21:07.032
And you are not coming in

21:07.032 --> 21:09.167
until you've sold
every single one.

21:09.167 --> 21:12.204
Big banana bonanza boom my foot!

21:12.204 --> 21:15.374
When am I ever going
to learn not to listen

21:15.374 --> 21:18.677
to those pin-headed
prevaricating porkers?

21:18.677 --> 21:20.245
You heard the boss.

21:20.746 --> 21:24.383
Get your bananas
on special today!

21:24.383 --> 21:27.986
Pig 2: Hey, you are eating
into the boss' profits.

21:27.986 --> 21:29.955
Pig 3: Now tell me honestly,

21:29.955 --> 21:34.026
