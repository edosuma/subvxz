WEBVTT

00:12.655 --> 00:14.189
Come on, Jian.

00:16.793 --> 00:18.695
You can do it.

00:21.530 --> 00:23.365
Do your trick.

00:23.398 --> 00:25.167
Make Papa proud, huh.

00:29.571 --> 00:32.307
Let's go.

00:38.380 --> 00:39.849
Come on.

00:44.353 --> 00:46.555
Ah.

00:46.589 --> 00:49.224
All right boys,
which one's gonna win?

00:54.664 --> 00:56.531
- Again!
- Okay, okay, ready?

00:59.468 --> 01:01.403
One.

01:01.436 --> 01:02.672
Two.

01:02.705 --> 01:03.640
Three.

01:03.673 --> 01:05.908
Ready, go!

01:10.913 --> 01:12.314
Find a good place?

01:12.347 --> 01:14.282
Okay, I'll go first.

01:17.687 --> 01:20.355
Under a bucket.

01:20.389 --> 01:21.658
- Red bucket?
- Mhm.

01:21.691 --> 01:24.827
Good one, okay, you.

01:24.861 --> 01:27.597
Jian, do your trick.

01:27.630 --> 01:28.631
Which one's gonna win?

01:28.665 --> 01:30.432
Come on boys, which one?

01:30.465 --> 01:32.635
Come on Jian, it's a hard one

01:32.669 --> 01:35.672
but you can do it!

01:35.705 --> 01:36.873
Close your eyes.

01:45.247 --> 01:46.716
You cheated.

01:46.749 --> 01:49.886
It's in your pocket.

01:49.919 --> 01:52.421
Okay, fine good job.

01:52.454 --> 01:54.824
- Again.
- Okay, okay, ready?

01:54.857 --> 01:57.292
Jian!

01:57.325 --> 02:00.495
- Wait, what's wrong?
- He's coming.

02:00.529 --> 02:01.698
He's coming, he's angry.

02:01.731 --> 02:03.700
Daddy wants to be mean!

02:13.475 --> 02:16.746
Boys, where are yah?

02:16.779 --> 02:20.415
Boys! Come out here boys!

04:01.117 --> 04:04.787
This has got to be the most
boring job in the world.

04:04.821 --> 04:06.923
No, listening to you complain

04:06.956 --> 04:09.892
is the most boring job
in the world.

04:54.704 --> 04:57.539
Intruder, Research Laboratory.

05:12.588 --> 05:14.657
9-1-1, what's your emergency?

05:41.516 --> 05:45.221
On your knees!

05:45.254 --> 05:48.624
Now!

05:57.833 --> 05:59.869
So I know this DJ.

05:59.902 --> 06:02.204
He's an asshole.

06:02.238 --> 06:04.073
Sir, sorry to interrupt.

06:04.106 --> 06:06.709
We had a break in,
corporate headquarters.

06:06.742 --> 06:07.743
we chased him into the street,
LAPD showed up

06:07.777 --> 06:09.745
and took him into custody.

06:09.779 --> 06:12.949
What exactly were
they trying to break into?

06:12.982 --> 06:14.884
Looks like he was trying
to break into the laboratory.

06:18.955 --> 06:20.756
Thank you.

06:24.193 --> 06:25.795
Give me a minute.

06:27.663 --> 06:29.198
So who is he?

06:29.231 --> 06:32.635
Police took him in but the
arrest report is not online yet.

06:32.668 --> 06:34.937
- Did he get into the lab?
- No.

06:34.971 --> 06:36.272
But security tells me
he tried to use

06:36.305 --> 06:38.274
Boa's R-Fit card to get in

06:38.307 --> 06:40.542
and that's what set off
the alarms.

06:40.576 --> 06:43.511
You should've told me
that earlier.

06:45.114 --> 06:47.750
Jian Huang.

06:47.783 --> 06:49.517
I've been expecting you.

07:07.136 --> 07:09.038
Whiskey Tango,
we are approaching the objective

07:09.071 --> 07:12.274
in one mike, be prepared
for immediate engagement.

07:18.781 --> 07:21.617
All teams move out.

07:25.688 --> 07:27.156
What do we got, Jian?

07:27.189 --> 07:29.258
I thought there was something
here but I cannot...

07:31.160 --> 07:32.795
- What the number?
- Stand by.

07:32.828 --> 07:34.597
I'm picking up something.

07:39.101 --> 07:41.103
Second floor, corner apartment.

07:41.137 --> 07:42.138
Move in.

07:42.171 --> 07:44.940
Apartment 7, green door.

08:18.340 --> 08:19.208
- Clear!
- Clear!

08:19.241 --> 08:23.112
Clear!

08:25.047 --> 08:28.117
There's nobody here.

08:30.653 --> 08:32.321
Under the bed.

08:32.354 --> 08:37.126
- Are they just...
- Under the bed!

08:52.942 --> 08:54.743
- Let me see your hands!
- Don't move!

08:54.777 --> 08:57.246
- Don't move!
- Hands up!

08:57.279 --> 08:59.748
- We got him.
- Target secured.

09:02.451 --> 09:05.187
- There's someone else.
- What!

10:31.840 --> 10:33.475
Ah!

10:53.395 --> 10:55.764
You're awake.

10:55.798 --> 10:58.834
Couldn't sleep.

10:58.867 --> 11:00.269
I got a special thanks
for my assent

11:00.302 --> 11:01.537
for your work last night.

11:01.570 --> 11:04.306
They've been searching for
that apartment for two years.

11:04.340 --> 11:05.374
I've got some paperwork here

11:05.407 --> 11:06.408
I'd like you to review.

11:06.442 --> 11:07.943
Something happened.

11:10.980 --> 11:13.415
You tried to decide
whether or not to tell me.

11:20.289 --> 11:22.358
I thought I should give it
some time.

11:22.391 --> 11:26.862
Maybe there was
more information.

11:26.895 --> 11:28.497
It's Bao, isn't it?

11:28.530 --> 11:30.466
They called me
early this morning.

11:30.499 --> 11:35.170
He's dead, isn't he?

11:35.204 --> 11:37.373
I wanted to see
if there was more information.

11:47.416 --> 11:49.818
I'm sorry, Jian.

11:49.852 --> 11:54.089
I'm sorry.

11:54.123 --> 11:56.125
Where?

11:56.158 --> 11:58.127
Los Angeles.

11:58.160 --> 12:00.462
They said suicide.

12:00.496 --> 12:02.331
It doesn't feel like that to me.

12:02.364 --> 12:04.166
I have to
take a look for myself.

12:04.199 --> 12:06.135
I can't authorize that, we need
to catch a plane to Prague.

12:06.168 --> 12:08.304
- You're in operation.
- I'm not asking for permission,

12:08.337 --> 12:12.308
Frank.

12:12.341 --> 12:14.043
It's my brother.

12:14.076 --> 12:16.011
Of course.

12:16.045 --> 12:17.079
I'll see what I can do.

12:17.112 --> 12:20.482
Just get me the clearance.

12:20.516 --> 12:22.619
I can handle myself.

12:28.424 --> 12:30.326
Just be careful.

12:33.896 --> 12:35.931
I don't think it's a good idea.

13:13.268 --> 13:14.937
You're waiting for me?

13:14.970 --> 13:15.638
Sorry?

13:15.672 --> 13:17.106
Oh, um.

13:17.139 --> 13:18.574
Hi, Detective Laurner.

13:18.608 --> 13:19.942
How'd you know it was me?

13:19.975 --> 13:22.277
You look like a cop.

13:22.311 --> 13:24.513
Hey, Mister... Mister Wang.

13:24.546 --> 13:26.616
- Huang.
- Huang.

13:26.649 --> 13:28.450
I'm sorry that we're late.

13:28.484 --> 13:30.653
I was told to meet you
at the gate.

13:30.687 --> 13:33.122
I'm Detective Stevens.

13:33.155 --> 13:36.392
Shall we?

14:22.004 --> 14:24.306
First time in LA?

14:24.339 --> 14:25.441
- Mhm.
- We're sorry

14:25.474 --> 14:27.309
for your circumstances.

14:27.342 --> 14:28.477
If there's anything we can do

14:28.510 --> 14:30.245
to make this a little easier

14:30.279 --> 14:32.649
don't hesitate to ask.

14:42.592 --> 14:44.661
If you need to,
uh, see your brother's body

14:44.694 --> 14:46.562
we can make that happen
if you want.

14:52.501 --> 14:55.170
Must have some
pretty powerful friends?

14:55.204 --> 14:56.371
Sorry?

14:56.405 --> 14:58.440
Well, this isn't exactly
what we do.

14:58.474 --> 15:00.442
We're working on
a kidnapping case.

15:00.476 --> 15:02.511
Not your brother's death
but we've been given orders

15:02.544 --> 15:04.046
to take you to the crime scene

15:04.079 --> 15:05.648
and provide whatever
evidence that you need.

15:05.682 --> 15:07.182
Jian, I'm sorry.

15:07.216 --> 15:09.518
It's just more than
a little unusual.

15:15.257 --> 15:16.593
What do you do
back there in Hong Kong?

15:16.626 --> 15:18.160
You a cop?

15:18.193 --> 15:20.295
- I think you passed it.
- What?

15:20.329 --> 15:22.498
I thought you said that
this was your first time in LA.

15:22.531 --> 15:26.101
How'd you know I passed it?

15:26.134 --> 15:31.240
I knew the address.

16:02.137 --> 16:04.172
The cleaning lady
found him here.

16:04.206 --> 16:05.642
The medical examiner estimated

16:05.675 --> 16:08.745
that he'd been diseased
for a couple hours.

16:08.778 --> 16:11.848
We're still waiting for
a full toxicology report.

16:11.881 --> 16:13.348
There was an empty bottle
of pills

16:13.382 --> 16:15.852
on the floor by his feet.

16:15.885 --> 16:21.290
Has your brother had
any history of medical problems?

16:21.323 --> 16:23.793
It wasn't from the prescription.

16:23.826 --> 16:27.296
There was enough of that stuff
to shutdown anybody's system.

16:27.329 --> 16:30.800
It's not the pills.

16:30.833 --> 16:34.671
You know, we don't know much
about your brother

16:34.704 --> 16:36.773
other than he's been living here

16:36.806 --> 16:40.610
under an expired visa
since three years ago.

16:40.643 --> 16:43.445
No employment records,
not even a bank account.

16:43.478 --> 16:45.480
Do you know how your brother
made his living?

16:45.514 --> 16:47.482
'Cause these places
don't come cheap.

16:47.516 --> 16:51.286
Sorry, I can't tell you that.

16:51.320 --> 16:53.823
And why is that?

16:53.856 --> 16:57.727
Because we haven't spoken
in years.

16:57.760 --> 17:01.530
May I ask how you
make your living?

17:01.563 --> 17:04.266
This isn't about me.

17:04.299 --> 17:05.334
He didn't die here.

17:05.367 --> 17:07.502
I beg your pardon.

17:07.536 --> 17:09.137
He was moved here.

17:09.171 --> 17:10.907
After he was killed.

17:10.940 --> 17:15.745
And why would you say that?

17:15.778 --> 17:17.680
He didn't kill himself.

17:17.714 --> 17:19.616
How would you know that,
you just said you hadn't spoken

17:19.649 --> 17:20.917
- to your brother in years.
- You know what,

17:20.950 --> 17:22.652
it really doesn't matter because
we're doing

17:22.685 --> 17:24.787
our own thorough investigation

17:24.821 --> 17:28.725
and we'll know exactly
what happened to your brother.

17:28.758 --> 17:30.459
Sounds great.

17:32.762 --> 17:34.897
Now if you don't mind,
I'd like to get some rest

17:34.931 --> 17:38.266
after that long flight.

17:38.300 --> 17:39.401
You're planning on staying?

17:39.434 --> 17:41.738
We were told to take you
to a hotel.

17:41.771 --> 17:43.405
Why would I stay in a hotel.

17:43.438 --> 17:45.908
This rent is paid, isn't it?

17:45.942 --> 17:48.510
Well, if you finally
think of something

17:48.543 --> 17:50.847
why don't you give us a call.

18:00.790 --> 18:02.357
Abby, Abby don't!

18:02.391 --> 18:04.559
- Don't, don't what?
- Don't... don't make this

18:04.594 --> 18:05.862
into something that it's not.

18:05.895 --> 18:07.529
All right,
it's a case of suicide.

18:07.562 --> 18:09.866
- Plain and simple.
- Well, he seems pretty sure

18:09.899 --> 18:11.433
and I don't know where
he's getting his information

18:11.466 --> 18:13.201
but there's something
he's not telling us.

18:13.235 --> 18:14.971
His brother is dead,
the family's a little weird.

18:15.004 --> 18:17.640
Weird, he goes in the apartment,
scans the place

18:17.674 --> 18:19.776
and suddenly it's murder,
what the hell was that?

18:19.809 --> 18:22.310
We've got other,
more important cases do we got.

18:22.344 --> 18:24.747
Something's not right
and you know it.

18:46.468 --> 18:49.005
- You cheated!
- How?

18:49.038 --> 18:52.608
It's in your pocket!

18:52.642 --> 18:55.578
Okay, fine good job.

19:07.990 --> 19:09.357
Jian, help me.

19:09.391 --> 19:11.027
Ah!

19:22.537 --> 19:23.940
On your knees!

20:09.585 --> 20:10.953
Hello?

20:12.655 --> 20:14.356
Arrested?

20:16.959 --> 20:18.694
Okay.

20:18.728 --> 20:21.097
I'll come pick him up.

20:21.130 --> 20:24.600
Thank you.

20:42.785 --> 20:45.453
I didn't do it.

20:45.487 --> 20:47.890
What's my son gonna think?

20:47.924 --> 20:50.525
Yeah, none of us did.

20:50.559 --> 20:54.096
He's gonna think
what I thought about my dad.

20:58.034 --> 21:00.770
What were you arrested for?

21:03.438 --> 21:07.475
They said
I robbed a jewelry store.

21:07.509 --> 21:11.379
They said they got the whole
thing on surveillance footage.

21:16.953 --> 21:18.721
Tell your lawyer the
surveillance footage

21:18.754 --> 21:20.156
was modified by the manager,

21:20.189 --> 21:21.757
he used someone
that looked like you

21:21.791 --> 21:23.626
and changed the timecode
so it matched the date

21:23.659 --> 21:26.629
you were there shopping for
your wife's anniversary present.

21:26.662 --> 21:28.396
It was an inside job.

21:28.430 --> 21:30.733
Hey, you got
a good story for me?

21:30.766 --> 21:33.535
Jian Huang.

21:41.878 --> 21:44.446
Mr. Huang,
how nice of you to call me.

21:44.479 --> 21:45.715
Getting into a lot
of trouble for someone

21:45.748 --> 21:47.449
so new to our city.

21:47.482 --> 21:51.553
Guess you weren't in need
of a rest after all.

22:05.668 --> 22:07.502
If it were up to me
you'd be back on a plane

22:07.535 --> 22:09.705
to wherever the hell
you came from.

22:12.474 --> 22:14.442
What?

22:14.476 --> 22:16.212
Vortex is not what it seems.

22:16.245 --> 22:18.446
It's not just
a software company.

22:18.480 --> 22:20.016
Vortex has been
a major player here

22:20.049 --> 22:22.952
in the software industry
for several years now.

22:22.985 --> 22:27.056
Someone at Vortex
killed my brother.

22:27.089 --> 22:28.925
How do you know that?

22:28.958 --> 22:30.626
I just know.

22:32.995 --> 22:35.097
Vortex has a lot of security.

22:35.131 --> 22:36.999
There's an entire locked down
part of the building.

22:37.033 --> 22:38.634
A secure part
of a software company

22:38.668 --> 22:40.870
and that is significant how?

22:40.903 --> 22:42.138
They're just protecting
their secrets

22:42.171 --> 22:44.874
like any other corporation.

22:45.675 --> 22:47.076
Secrets.

22:47.109 --> 22:48.911
Sure.

22:48.945 --> 22:50.613
It's not just
a software company.

23:14.270 --> 23:17.773
Where the hell
are you going now?

23:21.077 --> 23:23.245
What the...

23:28.784 --> 23:30.886
I told you, dude,
end of the line.

23:33.555 --> 23:35.758
You gotta go to
the end of the line, dude.

23:35.791 --> 23:38.828
The end of the line.

23:40.696 --> 23:42.198
What are you doing?

23:42.231 --> 23:43.866
I need to talk
to someone in there?

23:43.899 --> 23:45.533
- Who?
- He has something to do with

23:45.567 --> 23:46.836
my brother's murder.

23:46.869 --> 23:48.170
Alleged murder.

23:48.204 --> 23:51.040
- Murder.
- How can you be so sure?

23:51.073 --> 23:52.908
What is it
you're not telling me?

23:52.942 --> 23:54.677
I'm going in there
to talk to him

23:54.710 --> 23:58.247
you either can help me or
get me back out of jail again.

23:58.280 --> 24:01.717
Told you, end of the line
just like everybody else.

24:05.688 --> 24:11.794
LAPD.

24:18.300 --> 24:19.869
That's him.

24:19.902 --> 24:20.870
Who?

24:20.903 --> 24:22.271
Mason Roth.

24:22.304 --> 24:24.907
He works for Vortex.

24:24.940 --> 24:27.710
He knew my brother.

24:37.753 --> 24:40.990
What did you do to my brother?

24:41.023 --> 24:44.260
- What?
- What did you do to him?

24:44.293 --> 24:48.330
I don't know
what you're talking about.

24:57.373 --> 24:59.041
Jian help me.

24:59.075 --> 25:02.011
Ah!

25:38.948 --> 25:41.951
I shouldn't have gotten
you involved, I'm sorry.

25:59.401 --> 26:02.705
Expelled from MIT.

26:02.738 --> 26:05.441
That's weird.

26:05.474 --> 26:10.212
And then nothing
for several years until 2005.

26:10.246 --> 26:12.148
Started Vortex.

26:42.411 --> 26:44.380
Let's go.

26:49.985 --> 26:51.887
Come on.

26:57.426 --> 27:00.963
All right boys,
which one's gonna win?

27:02.531 --> 27:04.733
Which one?

27:06.402 --> 27:09.338
Jian.

27:09.371 --> 27:10.973
Do your trick.

27:11.006 --> 27:15.010
Make Papa proud, huh.

27:21.317 --> 27:23.419
That one.

27:23.452 --> 27:25.120
You sure?

27:25.154 --> 27:27.790
Yes, he's gonna break
that one's jaw.

27:27.823 --> 27:29.992
The fight won't last long.

27:37.299 --> 27:40.069
Hey!

27:40.102 --> 27:42.071
One thousand.

27:42.104 --> 27:44.373
Fifteen-hundred.

27:50.012 --> 27:52.047
Yeah!

27:59.288 --> 28:01.457
Yeah!

28:34.123 --> 28:36.492
Yes! Yes!

28:36.525 --> 28:38.494
Come on!

28:41.196 --> 28:43.565
Come on,
hitting the wrong guy, huh.

28:43.600 --> 28:47.836
You gotta fight!

28:47.870 --> 28:50.472
Hey, what are you doing?

28:50.506 --> 28:52.609
No!

29:05.521 --> 29:07.523
What are you doing!

29:07.556 --> 29:08.991
Why'd you tell him
the wrong one?

29:09.024 --> 29:11.327
He's gonna find out
and he's gonna beat us.

29:11.360 --> 29:12.428
To hell with him.

29:12.461 --> 29:13.529
Let's get the hell out of here.

29:13.562 --> 29:15.431
Let him win his own fights.

29:15.464 --> 29:17.866
No!

29:21.236 --> 29:22.938
Jian!

29:22.971 --> 29:25.074
I'm gonna kill your brother!

29:25.107 --> 29:27.543
You filthy little liar!

29:45.294 --> 29:46.362
Hello?

29:46.395 --> 29:49.431
It's me, Frank.

29:49.465 --> 29:53.168
I expect you're gonna be
on your way back here by now.

29:53.202 --> 29:54.903
Why didn't you call?

29:54.937 --> 29:57.306
Frank,
I'm sure he didn't kill himself.

29:57.339 --> 29:59.141
I can't go back.

29:59.174 --> 30:01.543
I can't go back
until I found out who it is.

30:01.578 --> 30:04.213
I did some digging and
I think Vortex is behind this.

30:09.719 --> 30:13.989
Vortex, that's Roth's company.

30:14.022 --> 30:15.424
I need your help, Frank.

30:15.457 --> 30:17.493
I can't do this alone.

30:17.526 --> 30:19.596
I'll be on the next plane there.

30:19.629 --> 30:22.498
But do me a favor, will yah?

30:22.531 --> 30:25.067
Keep your head low.

30:25.100 --> 30:27.035
I don't want to lose you too.

30:44.687 --> 30:47.523
Bao.

31:03.372 --> 31:05.742
Ugh!

31:08.645 --> 31:11.413
Ugh!

31:28.263 --> 31:30.265
Meet me at the control center.

31:30.299 --> 31:33.302
Yeah, now.

31:33.335 --> 31:35.003
Uh...

31:35.037 --> 31:38.307
give me another five minutes,
will you?

32:15.477 --> 32:18.347
- So what time was he there?
- About ten o'clock.

32:18.380 --> 32:20.482
He had a plain clothes cop
with him.

32:20.516 --> 32:22.317
Seemed like a detective.

32:22.351 --> 32:23.753
Well, where are they now?

32:23.786 --> 32:26.355
Jian went to Bao's apartment.

32:26.388 --> 32:29.091
We lost the detective.

32:29.124 --> 32:32.595
Jian knows we'll be watching
the apartment.

32:32.629 --> 32:34.062
You know what,
don't do anything.

32:34.096 --> 32:36.098
Let him come to us.

32:36.131 --> 32:37.734
But you call me as soon
as he leaves, all right?

32:37.767 --> 32:41.136
Yes, sir.

32:54.884 --> 32:56.318
- Can I help you?
- FBI.

32:56.351 --> 32:58.788
I'm here to see Captain Duke.

33:18.540 --> 33:20.208
So...

33:20.242 --> 33:21.510
solved the case already, huh?

33:21.543 --> 33:23.680
No, sir not yet.

33:23.713 --> 33:25.582
It's already been three days.

33:25.615 --> 33:27.449
And now you want Abby
back on the case.

33:27.482 --> 33:29.217
Actually no, we don't.

33:29.251 --> 33:31.219
And your rising young star
is about her find herself

33:31.253 --> 33:32.454
in a whole lot of trouble.

33:32.487 --> 33:34.824
Oh really?
How so?

33:34.857 --> 33:37.559
I guess she didn't tell you
about last night?

33:37.594 --> 33:39.428
No, she hasn't.

33:39.461 --> 33:41.496
A tourist, Jian Huang broke into

33:41.530 --> 33:43.666
the Vortex Software
Corporation Headquarters.

33:43.700 --> 33:45.233
Of course I knew about that.

33:45.267 --> 33:47.235
The state department
wanted him released

33:47.269 --> 33:49.906
and Vortex didn't object
so I sent Abby to pick him up.

33:49.939 --> 33:52.174
And then Mr. Huang and Abby
went to a nightclub

33:52.207 --> 33:53.508
where they assaulted the owner.

33:53.542 --> 33:55.510
Beat the crap out
of the bouncers.

33:55.544 --> 33:57.446
The owner of that club
was a man named Mason.

33:57.479 --> 33:59.214
He's a right-hand-man of Wallace

33:59.247 --> 34:02.284
who's the owner of Vortex.

34:02.317 --> 34:04.621
All right,
I'll get her side of it.

34:04.654 --> 34:06.656
That's just not gonna be
good enough, Captain.

34:06.689 --> 34:11.159
We need you to suspend her
until we tell you otherwise.

34:11.193 --> 34:13.228
Listen guys.

34:13.261 --> 34:15.263
I know you've probably
been spanked already

34:15.297 --> 34:17.734
for taking her
off the kidnapping case

34:17.767 --> 34:20.402
and not being able to solve it

34:20.435 --> 34:23.538
but I'm not gonna suspend her.

34:23.572 --> 34:25.340
You need to listen to me,
Captain,

34:25.374 --> 34:26.541
'cause I'm about
to tell you something

34:26.575 --> 34:27.944
that cannot leave this office.

34:27.977 --> 34:30.780
- Is that understood?
- All right.

34:30.813 --> 34:33.548
But it better be damn good.

34:33.583 --> 34:35.885
The president of Vortex,
Wallace,

34:35.918 --> 34:37.920
was a golden child at MIT.

34:37.954 --> 34:40.455
He entered the graduate program
at the age of 15.

34:40.489 --> 34:42.557
He was considered one of their
top engineering students

34:42.592 --> 34:44.861
but he matured
into a megalomaniac.

34:44.894 --> 34:46.596
Eventually, he was expelled.

34:46.629 --> 34:48.965
After that, he disappeared
into Asia for many years.

34:48.998 --> 34:50.833
Showed up back
in the United States

34:50.867 --> 34:52.567
about a decade later.

34:52.602 --> 34:54.637
Shortly after, he started
this software company,

34:54.671 --> 34:56.773
Vortex Software
here in Los Angeles.

34:56.806 --> 35:00.342
And we believe that
this company is a veneer over

35:00.375 --> 35:04.847
a huge international
criminal enterprise.

35:04.881 --> 35:06.949
He's extremely dangerous,
Captain.

35:06.983 --> 35:09.418
You need to get Abby
off this case now.

35:09.451 --> 35:10.586
Before she gets drawn
into something

35:10.620 --> 35:13.321
that she cannot handle.

35:13.355 --> 35:15.357
Okay.

35:15.390 --> 35:17.526
I'll take care of it.

35:17.559 --> 35:18.695
Very good.

35:18.728 --> 35:21.764
Thank you, let's go.

35:28.537 --> 35:29.806
Abby.

35:29.839 --> 35:32.909
My office now.

35:40.348 --> 35:42.350
- Captain, I...
- Don't say a word.

35:42.384 --> 35:43.820
Now you've gone too far
this time.

35:43.853 --> 35:45.621
You're suspended
until further notice.

35:45.655 --> 35:47.690
- Well, I don't understand...
- Buh-buh, listen.

35:47.724 --> 35:50.525
If you pursue the Vortex
or the kidnapping case

35:50.559 --> 35:53.763
in anyway whatsoever you will go
before the disciplinary board.

35:53.796 --> 35:55.732
Gun and shield.

36:16.786 --> 36:19.554
- Captain...
- Not a word!

36:24.861 --> 36:26.561
Go.

36:44.046 --> 36:45.782
- Yeah?
- Sir, the detective has entered

36:45.815 --> 36:47.984
Bao's apartment building.
How should we proceed?

36:48.017 --> 36:49.986
All right,
get some more guys up there.

36:50.019 --> 36:51.087
Just make sure
that they understand

36:51.120 --> 36:55.057
that I need Jian alive.

36:55.091 --> 36:56.993
All right, I need to see
inside the apartment.

36:57.026 --> 37:00.930
Get a drone over there but
don't let him see it, all right.

37:13.042 --> 37:14.811
I knew it, I knew there
was something wrong with you

37:14.844 --> 37:16.679
from the beginning
and I know there's a lot more

37:16.712 --> 37:17.880
going on with your brother
and Vortex

37:17.914 --> 37:19.582
than what you've told me.

37:19.615 --> 37:20.983
I can't tell you anymore.

37:21.017 --> 37:22.852
There's nothing
you can do now anyways.

37:22.885 --> 37:25.121
Just call it a suicide and
go back to your regular cases.

37:25.154 --> 37:26.889
I would if I could but I can't!

37:26.923 --> 37:30.559
Because I've been suspended!

37:30.593 --> 37:31.828
I warned you.

37:31.861 --> 37:35.031
I tried to keep you out of this.

37:35.064 --> 37:38.400
You should go now before
get into more trouble.

37:38.433 --> 37:41.003
How could I possibly
get into anymore trouble?

37:41.037 --> 37:44.006
Do you know how hard I've worked
to become a detective?

37:44.040 --> 37:46.508
Now I'm not going anywhere
until I get my badge back

37:46.541 --> 37:49.779
and I can't get my badge back
until Bao's murder is solved.

37:49.812 --> 37:51.513
So you know
it's not a suicide now?

37:51.546 --> 37:53.616
No, I checked the
toxicology report this morning.

37:53.649 --> 37:56.451
There wasn't enough medication
to shutdown his system.

37:56.484 --> 37:58.453
So now I need you to tell me
everything you know

37:58.486 --> 38:01.958
about Wallace,
your brother and Vortex now.

38:01.991 --> 38:03.759
All right.

38:03.793 --> 38:04.994
Let's talk.

38:14.804 --> 38:16.772
I'm going to tell you something.

38:16.806 --> 38:19.407
You're not going to
believe me at first.

38:19.441 --> 38:22.078
But what I'm about to tell you
is true.

38:22.111 --> 38:23.880
What?

38:23.913 --> 38:28.150
My brother and I were born
with the ability to see things.

38:28.184 --> 38:29.852
Like clairvoyants?

38:29.886 --> 38:32.688
Something like that, yes.

38:32.722 --> 38:34.924
Give me your hand.

38:55.778 --> 38:59.481
You took Victoria's doll
from the crime scene?

39:02.184 --> 39:05.187
How could you
possibly know that?

39:06.789 --> 39:08.925
When we touch someone
or something

39:08.958 --> 39:12.494
or sometimes even
if we get close enough

39:12.527 --> 39:14.764
we have visions.

39:14.797 --> 39:17.565
Who are you really?

39:17.600 --> 39:20.169
My brother and were recruited
to the ISN

39:20.202 --> 39:22.570
to track down persons
of interest

39:22.605 --> 39:27.977
but my brother couldn't tolerate
the structure within ISN.

39:28.010 --> 39:30.079
How does Wallace
fit into all this?

39:30.112 --> 39:33.783
Wallace once worked for the ISN.

39:33.816 --> 39:36.619
It was him
who convinced Bao to leave.

39:36.652 --> 39:39.155
One day they just...

39:39.188 --> 39:40.856
disappeared.

40:44.720 --> 40:47.056
Spread out,
and search the basement.

40:50.259 --> 40:52.228
Hey, hey, hey,
he's over here!

42:30.693 --> 42:33.429
The target escaped
using the north exit.

42:47.843 --> 42:49.411
I need to call Frank,
he was supposed to meet me

42:49.445 --> 42:53.282
at the apartment 'bout now.

42:53.315 --> 42:56.719
No signal, need to get closer
to outside to make a call.

42:56.752 --> 42:57.720
Wait here.

42:57.753 --> 43:00.289
Wait, you can't
leave me alone right now!

43:28.117 --> 43:29.785
Something's wrong.

43:53.876 --> 43:55.144
Get up, get up,

43:55.177 --> 43:57.313
get up, I'll do it myself.

44:01.984 --> 44:03.919
Okay.

44:13.529 --> 44:15.798
Got you.

44:18.567 --> 44:21.804
Son of a bitch.

44:52.134 --> 44:53.335
Okay.

45:23.499 --> 45:25.901
Okay, where the hell are you?

46:12.081 --> 46:13.182
All right,
get the drone outta there,

46:13.215 --> 46:15.551
but keep it nearby.

46:15.585 --> 46:17.353
Okay, sir,
but the battery's almost dead.

46:17.386 --> 46:18.954
Then fly another one over there.

46:18.987 --> 46:21.056
You understand me?

46:29.498 --> 46:30.899
All right, they're in
a warehouse somewhere near

46:30.933 --> 46:32.401
Boyle Heights,
6th Street Bridge.

46:32.434 --> 46:33.902
I'm gonna text you
the address right now.

46:33.936 --> 46:35.170
Get over there
as quick as you can.

46:35.204 --> 46:37.172
You get him back alive.

46:37.206 --> 46:39.508
As far as the cop goes,
do whatever you gotta do.

46:46.716 --> 46:48.050
While you were out,

46:48.083 --> 46:50.085
I thought of a way
we can get into Vortex.

46:52.221 --> 46:53.355
Let's go.

47:35.030 --> 47:36.131
Hey!

48:08.765 --> 48:10.566
You gotta jump!

48:18.407 --> 48:19.642
Let's go, let's go!

49:02.317 --> 49:04.052
Frank,

49:04.086 --> 49:06.589
so nice to see you again.

49:06.623 --> 49:08.758
I can't honestly say the same.

49:08.791 --> 49:10.760
Last time I saw you
was a photo on the front page

49:10.793 --> 49:12.194
of People's Daily.

49:12.227 --> 49:13.562
You were on your way to prison

49:13.596 --> 49:15.798
for corruption.

49:15.832 --> 49:19.301
I would have preferred
that was my last memory of you.

49:19.334 --> 49:21.136
Stick him in the laboratory.

49:40.389 --> 49:42.324
I'm hungry.

49:42.357 --> 49:45.662
Don't worry,
I'll figure something out.

49:52.134 --> 49:54.771
Hi, I'm Val, nice to meet you.

49:54.804 --> 49:57.205
Have a nice day.

49:57.239 --> 49:58.507
My brother and I
were just looking for

49:58.540 --> 50:01.276
- something to eat!
- I said have a nice day.

50:37.914 --> 50:44.654
Fine, your phone number
is 139-1016-7789, right?

50:44.687 --> 50:46.623
I think I got just
enough money to make a call

50:46.656 --> 50:47.590
to your wife, Mai Hoi,

50:47.624 --> 50:50.425
and let her know about
your mistress Sonny.

50:50.459 --> 50:52.795
Of course, if you give us
some money for lunch,

50:52.829 --> 50:54.864
I might just forget
about the phone call.

50:54.897 --> 50:56.164
We're just hungry.

51:18.220 --> 51:19.622
Jian, are you all right?

51:22.557 --> 51:25.494
I keep forgetting how hard
this must be for you.

51:25.527 --> 51:29.364
Even if you two weren't close,
he was still your brother.

51:29.398 --> 51:30.733
We were close.

51:30.767 --> 51:33.836
We just chose different
paths, that's all.

51:33.870 --> 51:37.239
I'm sorry.

51:37.272 --> 51:38.573
Anyway, we should
probably call Carl.

51:38.608 --> 51:40.442
I think he's the only one
who can help us now.

51:58.761 --> 51:59.762
Hello?

51:59.796 --> 52:02.330
Carl, it's Abby.

52:02.364 --> 52:04.634
We need help.

52:04.667 --> 52:05.968
Abigail?

52:06.002 --> 52:06.969
How have you been?

52:16.045 --> 52:19.649
He can't help us.

52:19.682 --> 52:22.985
He's never called me
Abigail before.

52:23.019 --> 52:25.788
Abby.

52:28.825 --> 52:30.727
That wasn't long enough,
I couldn't get a location.

52:35.832 --> 52:37.299
Carl.

52:42.537 --> 52:45.407
- Was that her?
- Yeah.

52:45.440 --> 52:47.576
She said she's in trouble.

52:47.610 --> 52:49.679
Now, I don't know what,
Chief, but I tell ya

52:49.712 --> 52:51.581
somethin' doesn't
smell right here.

52:51.614 --> 52:54.316
This Wallace, he's supposed
to be some serious criminal?

52:54.349 --> 52:55.618
Then how come
they're not chasin' him,

52:55.651 --> 52:57.053
instead of trying to find Abby?

52:57.086 --> 52:58.688
I know, I know.

52:58.721 --> 53:00.590
Looks like they're tryin'
to use our girl as bait.

53:00.623 --> 53:01.691
- Bait?
- Look, look, I know

53:01.724 --> 53:02.759
you're concerned about Abby,

53:02.792 --> 53:04.559
but she can take
care of herself.

53:04.594 --> 53:05.460
I need you on this case.

53:05.494 --> 53:07.697
The mayor's all over
my ass about it.

53:07.730 --> 53:09.397
Give me a progress
report, will you?

53:09.431 --> 53:11.466
And, make it soon.

53:24.080 --> 53:27.683
Sir, we just lost Jian
and the detective.

53:50.840 --> 53:52.675
So this is my baby, Frank,

53:52.708 --> 53:56.012
designed by me
and a team of engineers.

53:56.045 --> 53:58.480
You know what this is, Frank?

53:58.513 --> 54:00.116
You have any idea
what it does?

54:00.149 --> 54:02.417
If not, it's okay, I wouldn't
really expect you to know.

54:02.450 --> 54:04.720
It's a lot of expensive shit!

54:04.754 --> 54:06.022
You're right.

54:06.055 --> 54:07.389
You're right, Frank,
you're right

54:07.422 --> 54:09.625
it's very expensive, it is.

54:09.659 --> 54:12.695
It's a lot of fun
to play with as well.

54:12.728 --> 54:14.130
Crane your neck, see if you can
see this screen right here.

54:14.163 --> 54:17.033
Can you see that?

54:17.066 --> 54:20.468
You know what you're
lookin' at right there?

54:20.502 --> 54:23.371
That there's an image of
your brain activity, Frank.

54:26.541 --> 54:27.509
As a matter of fact,
that's what it looks like

54:27.542 --> 54:30.545
when you're trying to
come up with a plan.

54:30.580 --> 54:31.747
Relax, Frank.

54:31.781 --> 54:32.882
You're not goin' anywhere.

54:32.915 --> 54:35.051
You're insane, Wallace!

54:35.084 --> 54:36.986
And right there,
you see that image?

54:37.019 --> 54:40.957
See that's your brain
on emotion.

54:40.990 --> 54:43.159
See, with this instrument,

54:43.192 --> 54:45.127
I can pretty much
read your mind.

54:45.161 --> 54:49.599
But more importantly,
Frank, is I can record it.

54:49.632 --> 54:51.767
Start the injection.

54:51.801 --> 54:53.535
No, back off!

54:53.568 --> 54:56.504
Just a tiny prick, Frank.

54:59.942 --> 55:01.844
It's a tiny prick, Frank.

55:01.878 --> 55:04.881
It's not that painful.

55:04.914 --> 55:06.883
What you got goin'
into your neck right there,

55:06.916 --> 55:09.986
that's a neurotransmitter
enhancer.

55:10.019 --> 55:10.887
The effect of that drug

55:10.920 --> 55:13.589
when combined with
my use of this tool,

55:13.623 --> 55:14.724
well let me tell you
what it does.

55:14.757 --> 55:15.892
That signature right there,

55:15.925 --> 55:17.492
what I can do is
I can amplify that

55:17.525 --> 55:18.895
a little more than ten times,

55:18.928 --> 55:19.729
then reverse engineer it,

55:19.762 --> 55:21.697
and put it right
back in ya, Frank.

55:21.731 --> 55:24.800
You know what that
allows me to do to you?

55:24.834 --> 55:26.802
Lets me control you, buddy.

55:59.068 --> 56:01.569
Ah!

56:01.604 --> 56:03.973
Sorry, I have a flat tire.

56:04.006 --> 56:05.241
Two flats in one day.

56:05.274 --> 56:07.743
- Uh, yeah.
- Can I help?

56:07.777 --> 56:10.112
Yeah, I think this one's
gonna be okay, but, um,

56:10.146 --> 56:11.180
could you help with the car?

56:11.213 --> 56:13.049
- I can take a look.
- Yeah, it hurts pretty bad,

56:13.082 --> 56:14.984
so I'm just gonna stay here.

56:15.017 --> 56:18.120
There's a spare
in the trunk, I think.

56:45.214 --> 56:46.816
He's in the basement,
we need to shut down

56:46.849 --> 56:47.783
the security cameras.

56:47.817 --> 56:49.585
The camera recorders
are in the cable room.

56:49.618 --> 56:51.587
Left at the first hallway,
second door on the right.

57:16.979 --> 57:19.949
Not if you're gonna do
exactly as we say.

57:19.982 --> 57:23.652
Okay, which one of these is
the surveillance camera router?

57:23.686 --> 57:25.888
The three on the left.

57:25.921 --> 57:27.289
These ones?

57:39.135 --> 57:41.804
What do you mean crashed?

57:41.837 --> 57:44.974
Well, send a technician
down there now!

57:45.007 --> 57:47.276
What was that about?

57:47.309 --> 57:50.813
Problem with
the security camera system.

57:50.846 --> 57:52.848
Perfect.

57:52.882 --> 57:54.850
Perfect?

57:54.884 --> 57:57.186
She's gonna come here
and try and rescue Frank.

57:57.219 --> 57:59.221
Put the building on lockdown.

57:59.255 --> 58:01.590
Yes, sir.

58:01.624 --> 58:03.125
I need the building
on lockdown now.

58:04.760 --> 58:05.895
We have two intruders
in the building,

58:05.928 --> 58:07.630
one male, one female.

58:07.663 --> 58:09.365
I need them taken alive.

58:11.367 --> 58:15.805
So, Frank,
Jian will be here soon.

58:32.088 --> 58:33.322
Hey!

59:38.187 --> 59:39.188
That was fast.

59:39.221 --> 59:41.390
Yeah, I was, uh,
just passin' by.

59:41.423 --> 59:43.259
Is there some kind of trouble?

59:43.292 --> 59:44.426
Our camera system's down.

59:44.460 --> 59:46.295
I guess it set off
the alarm somehow.

59:46.328 --> 59:48.130
- Computers.
- Yeah.

59:48.164 --> 59:50.833
They're more trouble
than they're worth these days.

59:50.866 --> 59:52.801
Say, uh, look, I was, uh,

59:52.835 --> 59:54.403
lookin' for a place
to relieve myself.

59:54.436 --> 59:56.205
- Too much coffee.
- I'm really not supposed to let

59:56.238 --> 59:57.473
any non-employees through.

59:57.506 --> 59:59.708
Oh.

59:59.742 --> 1:00:01.010
That's fine, that's fine.

1:00:01.043 --> 1:00:02.678
- Thank you, buddy.
- Uh-huh.

1:00:15.758 --> 1:00:18.093
Hey, it's a trap, get out!

1:01:27.296 --> 1:01:29.531
Jian!

1:01:29.565 --> 1:01:31.200
Help me!

1:01:52.354 --> 1:01:54.823
I saw this.

1:01:54.857 --> 1:01:56.458
It's where you
killed my brother.

1:01:56.492 --> 1:01:57.893
That was an accident.

1:01:57.926 --> 1:01:59.328
Strapping him to this
machine was no accident.

1:01:59.361 --> 1:02:00.963
Of course it was.

1:02:00.996 --> 1:02:02.364
But there's some
information that I need,

1:02:02.398 --> 1:02:03.966
and fortunately for me,

1:02:03.999 --> 1:02:05.567
you can give it to me.

1:02:07.970 --> 1:02:09.872
Sadun Al-Biati,

1:02:09.905 --> 1:02:12.041
chief financial officer
for OPEC.

1:02:12.074 --> 1:02:13.242
There's a number in his head,
and I'd like you to

1:02:13.275 --> 1:02:14.510
give it to me.

1:02:18.147 --> 1:02:20.916
But you don't
say anything, do you?

1:02:20.949 --> 1:02:24.153
Neither could Bao,
'till I built this.

1:02:24.186 --> 1:02:27.022
But what this little toy
allows me to do

1:02:27.056 --> 1:02:30.492
is exponentially increase
your clairvoyance level.

1:02:30.526 --> 1:02:32.294
Number?

1:02:32.328 --> 1:02:34.196
A number, that's what
this is all about?

1:02:34.229 --> 1:02:35.632
A number?

1:02:35.665 --> 1:02:38.500
Yeah, just a number,

1:02:38.534 --> 1:02:41.537
but a number that unlocks
OPEC's banking system,

1:02:41.570 --> 1:02:43.372
a series of numbers that
will allow me to empty out

1:02:43.405 --> 1:02:45.908
several sheikh's bank
accounts in microseconds.

1:02:45.941 --> 1:02:47.343
I didn't get anything
from that photo,

1:02:47.376 --> 1:02:49.378
and even if I did,
I'll never tell you.

1:02:49.411 --> 1:02:51.246
You will,

1:02:51.280 --> 1:02:53.082
you will.

1:02:53.115 --> 1:02:55.918
Or Frank here's gonna have
a very unpleasant experience.

1:02:55.951 --> 1:02:57.587
- You're nuts.
- Followed very closely by

1:02:57.620 --> 1:03:00.590
Abby's very
unpleasant experience.

1:03:03.926 --> 1:03:06.562
Ah, God!

1:03:06.596 --> 1:03:08.997
Ah, ah!

1:03:10.466 --> 1:03:12.901
Damn you, Wallace!

1:03:12.935 --> 1:03:16.071
Hear that snap, Jian?

1:03:16.105 --> 1:03:17.973
That's a metacarpal
being broken.

1:03:18.006 --> 1:03:20.008
What my colleague here did
is he took his finger

1:03:20.042 --> 1:03:21.009
and pressed it the wrong way

1:03:21.043 --> 1:03:24.079
all the way to his wrist,
a hyperextension.

1:03:24.113 --> 1:03:26.315
It's very painful.

1:03:26.348 --> 1:03:28.217
See, see,

1:03:28.250 --> 1:03:31.553
you'll give me
anything that I want.

1:03:39.228 --> 1:03:40.929
Let's power it up.

1:03:58.213 --> 1:04:00.449
Chief financial officer
for OPEC.

1:04:03.753 --> 1:04:05.487
Daddy was being mean.

1:04:09.291 --> 1:04:11.059
We're hungry.

1:04:15.197 --> 1:04:17.499
Backup needed,
Vortex corporate headquarters.

1:04:17.533 --> 1:04:18.967
Kill her.

1:04:32.448 --> 1:04:34.016
What'd you see?

1:04:37.252 --> 1:04:39.354
Cops

1:04:39.388 --> 1:04:41.624
coming for you.

1:04:41.658 --> 1:04:43.726
- Really?
- Sir, he's right.

1:04:43.760 --> 1:04:45.394
Cops are in the building.

1:04:49.498 --> 1:04:51.634
- Put a chopper on the roof now.
- Copy that.

1:04:51.668 --> 1:04:54.102
Get the chopper to the roof now.

1:04:55.537 --> 1:04:56.472
Back!

1:04:56.505 --> 1:04:58.173
Back your ass.

1:05:07.483 --> 1:05:08.450
Okay.

1:05:09.351 --> 1:05:10.219
I have the detective,

1:05:10.252 --> 1:05:12.387
I'll meet you on the roof.

1:05:22.431 --> 1:05:23.766
Go get 'em!

1:05:57.199 --> 1:05:58.567
Go get Wallace!

1:08:00.957 --> 1:08:02.424
I'll take care of you.

1:08:16.639 --> 1:08:17.305
Clear the helipad.

1:08:17.339 --> 1:08:19.307
We are two minutes from landing.

1:08:22.912 --> 1:08:25.213
Come on, Jian!

1:08:25.247 --> 1:08:26.616
You can do it.

1:08:50.807 --> 1:08:52.407
Ah!

1:09:36.351 --> 1:09:37.787
Hey, come here,
but give me the cuffs,

1:09:37.820 --> 1:09:38.821
give me the cuffs!

1:09:38.855 --> 1:09:39.856
Cuff them!

1:10:04.046 --> 1:10:06.616
All right, come here, tough guy.

1:10:06.649 --> 1:10:08.718
Ah, come on,
on your feet.

1:10:12.655 --> 1:10:14.456
Thank you, detective,
we'll take him from here.

1:10:14.489 --> 1:10:15.825
We can hold him on
kidnapping charges

1:10:15.858 --> 1:10:17.960
while we look into
the rest of his business.

1:10:17.994 --> 1:10:20.062
Yeah, why don't you just
take all the credit, huh?

1:10:20.096 --> 1:10:21.731
Sorry to hear you feel that way.

1:10:21.764 --> 1:10:24.000
You did a wonderful job,
you should be proud of yourself.

1:10:33.109 --> 1:10:35.912
Carl, can I get back on
the Victoria case now?

1:10:38.915 --> 1:10:41.851
Jian, can we?

1:10:41.884 --> 1:10:43.552
We can find the girl.

1:10:45.588 --> 1:10:46.923
You know what,
I'll tell the captain

1:10:46.956 --> 1:10:48.891
that you need a few more days.

1:10:48.925 --> 1:10:50.726
And you go find that girl,

1:10:50.760 --> 1:10:52.695
and why don't you
take Jian with you?

1:10:52.728 --> 1:10:53.863
Like I said,

1:10:53.896 --> 1:10:56.565
you two make
an excellent pair.

1:10:58.533 --> 1:10:59.902
Thank you.

1:11:41.010 --> 1:11:42.778
Hold, don't move!

1:12:07.502 --> 1:12:08.804
Victoria?

1:12:11.140 --> 1:12:12.875
Victoria, it's okay.

1:12:12.909 --> 1:12:14.043
It's okay, you're safe.

1:12:14.076 --> 1:12:15.611
You're safe.

1:12:15.645 --> 1:12:16.679
You're safe!

1:12:16.712 --> 1:12:18.546
You're safe, I got you!

1:12:21.617 --> 1:12:24.220
Come on, come on,
let's get outta here.

1:12:43.606 --> 1:12:45.007
Hi, sweetheart.

1:12:45.041 --> 1:12:47.710
Victoria, this is Brooke,
she'll take care of you.

1:12:47.743 --> 1:12:49.779
I promise.

1:12:49.812 --> 1:12:50.947
Come on.

1:12:50.980 --> 1:12:52.848
I'll take it from here.

1:12:59.121 --> 1:13:00.990
Congratulations, detective.

1:13:01.023 --> 1:13:03.558
Field office just
contacted me just now.

1:13:03.592 --> 1:13:05.061
DC would like you
to join the agency.

1:13:05.094 --> 1:13:08.197
Can you come in
tomorrow morning, 9:00?

1:13:08.230 --> 1:13:10.498
Thank you, but, um,

1:13:10.532 --> 1:13:13.803
I can't, I have other plans.

1:13:13.836 --> 1:13:16.538
Well, the agency's offering you

1:13:16.571 --> 1:13:18.908
a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

1:13:18.941 --> 1:13:21.210
Thank you so much,
but you can tell the agency

1:13:21.243 --> 1:13:22.577
I won't be coming in.

1:13:22.611 --> 1:13:23.779
All right.

1:13:23.813 --> 1:13:24.780
Your choice.

1:13:24.814 --> 1:13:25.881
Great job today.

1:13:25.915 --> 1:13:27.883
Thank you.

1:13:44.667 --> 1:13:47.203
I would have liked
to have met him.

1:13:47.236 --> 1:13:49.905
He would have liked you.

1:13:59.949 --> 1:14:02.051
It's in your pocket.

1:14:02.084 --> 1:14:03.619
Good job.

1:14:03.652 --> 1:14:05.621
We got a plane to catch.
