WEBVTT

00:05.773 --> 00:08.008
( theme music playing )

00:16.217 --> 00:18.119
( knocking at door )

00:19.019 --> 00:21.322
- HI.
- GOOD EVENING.

00:21.422 --> 00:23.924
( laughs )

00:24.024 --> 00:26.060
- I'M RUNNING
A LITTLE LATE.
- OKAY.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.395
I NEED FIVE MINUTES.

00:27.495 --> 00:29.530
Man on TV:
Welcome, designers!

00:29.630 --> 00:32.933
You've heard the expression
"She'd even look great
in a potato sack"?

00:33.033 --> 00:35.703
Well, you're going
to prove that point
with this challenge.

00:35.803 --> 00:40.508
You will be creating
a party-worthy look
out of burlap...

00:44.845 --> 00:45.946
- OH.
- HI.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.649
- HI.
- MY NAME IS GREG.

00:48.749 --> 00:49.883
- IS IT?
- YES.

00:49.983 --> 00:51.652
- MY NAME IS LARRY.
- HI.

00:51.752 --> 00:53.020
A GREAT PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU.

00:53.121 --> 00:55.389
- OH, THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.

00:55.489 --> 00:58.426
- SO WHAT ARE YOU DRAWING?
- OH, I'M JUST DOODLING.

00:58.526 --> 01:01.262
THAT'S A HITLER MUSTACHE.
THAT'S HITLER HAIR.

01:01.362 --> 01:04.365
- WHAT'S A HITLER?
- HITLER WAS A BAD MAN.

01:04.465 --> 01:06.834
- A BAD MAN?
- A VERY BAD MAN.

01:06.934 --> 01:08.669
- OH MY GOD.
- YES, HE STARTED A WAR.

01:08.769 --> 01:12.173
HE DIDN'T-- HE DIDN'T
REALLY CARE FOR JEWS.

01:12.273 --> 01:14.108
HE THOUGHT THEY WERE
A BIT MUCH.

01:14.208 --> 01:16.810
( scoffs )
I WOULD KICK HIS BUTT.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.412
- WOULD YOU?
- YES.

01:18.512 --> 01:20.714
GOOD FOR YOU.
WHAT-- WHAT ARE YOU
WATCHING IN THERE?

01:20.814 --> 01:22.983
"PROJECT RUNWAY."

01:23.083 --> 01:25.018
- GOOD SHOW.
- AND WHAT DO YOU
LIKE ABOUT IT?

01:25.119 --> 01:27.821
THE FASHION!

01:27.921 --> 01:30.023
IT'S LIKE
THE BEST SHOW EVER.

01:30.124 --> 01:32.926
- YOU LIKE FASHION?
- YES, I DO.

01:33.026 --> 01:35.229
HMM.

01:35.329 --> 01:37.265
OOH, WHAT'S THAT
RIGHT THERE?

01:37.365 --> 01:40.134
OH, THAT'S CALLED
A SWASTIKA.

01:40.234 --> 01:42.470
I LIKE HOW THE LINES
JUST GO STRAIGHT

01:42.570 --> 01:44.205
AND THEN UP
AND THEN DOWN

01:44.305 --> 01:46.140
AND THEN STRAIGHT
AND THEN UP AND
THEN DOWN.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.875
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

01:47.975 --> 01:51.912
MY BIRTHDAY'S
COMING UP IN A WEEK,
SO CAN YOU GET ME ONE?

01:52.012 --> 01:54.215
- A SWASTIKA?
- YEAH.

01:54.315 --> 01:56.217
UH, I-- I DON'T KNOW, GREG.
I'LL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT.

01:56.317 --> 01:58.051
THEY SHOULD START
SELLING THEM

01:58.152 --> 02:00.188
IN EVERY GIFT SHOP
IN NEW YORK CITY.

02:00.288 --> 02:01.955
I DON'T THINK
JEWS WOULD LIKE THAT.

02:02.055 --> 02:04.592
GET A LIFE, JEWS!

02:04.692 --> 02:07.495
HMM. YEAH.

02:07.595 --> 02:08.796
OKAY.

02:08.896 --> 02:11.131
UH, IS YOUR MOM READY?

02:11.232 --> 02:12.666
OKAY, SWEETIE,
NANA'S WAITING FOR YOU.

02:12.766 --> 02:15.102
- SHE'S GONNA GIVE YOU
A BATH, OKAY?
- OKAY.

02:15.203 --> 02:17.938
- OKAY.
- TAKE GOOD CARE
OF HER. BYE.

02:18.038 --> 02:19.373
( laughs )
THANKS.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.074
HE'S SOMETHING ELSE,
ISN'T HE?

02:21.175 --> 02:23.277
- THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT.
- AW.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.045
- SO, ARE YOU READY?
- READY.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.348
SO SUSIE TELLS ME
YOU'RE QUITE A PIANO PLAYER.

02:27.448 --> 02:29.417
OH.
EH, I DON'T KNOW.

02:29.517 --> 02:31.685
IT'S BACKGROUND,
SO DON'T GET YOUR
HOPES UP TOO HIGH.

02:31.785 --> 02:34.288
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT'S JUST
IN THE BACKGROUND?
- NO, YOU'LL SEE.

02:34.388 --> 02:36.790
( piano music playing )

02:36.890 --> 02:39.860
( loud chatter )

02:44.265 --> 02:46.534
HEY. SHH!
COME ON.

02:46.634 --> 02:49.570
A PIANIST
IS PLAYING UP THERE.

02:49.670 --> 02:52.440
SHE'S PLAYING.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.875
- ( chatter continues )
- Larry: HEY, SHH! QUIET.

02:54.975 --> 02:58.279
SO RUDE.
UNBELIEVABLE.

03:02.416 --> 03:05.219
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
MY ASSISTANT CALLED.
TABLE FOR THREE.

03:07.054 --> 03:09.723
- HEY, IT'S LARRY.
I'M GONNA GO SAY HI.
- Man: OKAY.

03:09.823 --> 03:12.626
- WHAT'S UP?
- Larry: HEY.
HEY, MIKE.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.662
- I HEAR WE'RE
NEIGHBORS NOW.
- YEAH.

03:14.762 --> 03:16.697
YOU LIVE DOWNSTAIRS.
YOU GOT THE PLACE DOWNSTAIRS.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.332
YEAH YEAH, SHH.
TRY AND KEEP IT DOWN.
SHE'S--

03:18.432 --> 03:20.934
- SORRY?
- SHE'S PLAYING. SHH.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.404
BUT SHE'S--
IT'S BACKGROUND MUSIC.

03:23.504 --> 03:25.473
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT STILL,
JUST TRY AND KEEP IT DOWN.

03:25.573 --> 03:28.008
- WAIT, YOU KNOW HER?
- I'M DATING HER.

03:28.108 --> 03:30.177
- OH, YOU'RE DATING HER?
- YES. SHH!

03:30.278 --> 03:32.713
IT'S NOT CARNEGIE HALL.
IT'S JUST A BAR.

03:32.813 --> 03:35.683
- I KNOW, BUT IT'S RUDE
TO TALK, THAT'S ALL.
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

03:35.783 --> 03:38.252
- WELL, SEE YOU
AROUND THE BUILDING.
- I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

03:38.352 --> 03:39.987
SEE YA LATER.

03:40.087 --> 03:41.822
WHAT WERE YOU SAYING
ABOUT THE FROG?

03:41.922 --> 03:45.393
THERE WAS AN INFLATABLE FROG
THAT CAME OUT OF A FRENCH
RESTAURANT IN VEGAS.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.796
YOU'RE GETTING ONE OF
THOSE FOOFY DRINKS, RIGHT?

03:48.896 --> 03:50.764
NO, I'M GONNA GO
WITH STRAIGHT TEQUILA.

03:50.864 --> 03:53.967
HEY, FOX.
FOX! FOX!

03:54.902 --> 03:56.537
SHH!
COME ON.

03:56.637 --> 04:00.274
- SHE'S PLAYING.
- YEAH.

04:01.041 --> 04:03.911
( piano flourish )

04:05.245 --> 04:08.849
( scattered applause )

04:08.949 --> 04:10.984
Larry:
YEAH, CLAP.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.988
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT.
I REALLY DON'T.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.024
IT'S ATMOSPHERE.
IT'S A NICE SETTING.

04:17.124 --> 04:20.661
- I'M REALLY GLAD YOU'RE HERE.
- I FOUND IT REALLY ANNOYING.

04:20.761 --> 04:24.031
- HEY, YOU GOT TO KNOW GREG
A LITTLE BIT.
- YEAH, I DID.

04:24.131 --> 04:26.700
HE'S QUITE A--
QUITE A YOUNG MAN.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.803
HE'S REALLY LIKE
ONE OF MY FAVORITE PEOPLE
IN THE WORLD, OBVIOUSLY.

04:29.903 --> 04:34.207
YEAH. WELL, I MEAN
IT MUST BE VERY...

04:34.308 --> 04:37.311
YOU KNOW, CHALLENGING
TO HAVE A SON LIKE THAT.

04:37.411 --> 04:38.946
YOU KNOW, I SIGNED UP
FOR SINGLE MOTHERHOOD.

04:39.046 --> 04:42.716
IT'S NOT LIKE A BIG--
TO ME THAT'S PART OF
THE DEAL, YOU KNOW.

04:42.816 --> 04:44.485
NO, BUT I MEAN,

04:44.585 --> 04:47.355
YOU KNOW,
HIS BEING SO...

04:47.455 --> 04:48.856
FLAMBOYANT.

04:48.956 --> 04:53.361
I THINK THE FACT THAT HE CAN
SORT OF SELL A SONG AND--

04:53.461 --> 04:55.829
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE HE GETS IT.
THERE'S NOBODY LIKE HIM.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.699
IT MAKES HIM REALLY SPECIAL
AND UNIQUE AND DIFFERENT.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.200
OKAY.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.436
HIS BIRTHDAY'S NEXT WEEK.

05:02.536 --> 05:04.171
WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA
HAVE A PARTY.

05:04.271 --> 05:06.206
YOU'RE WELCOME TO COME.
PROBABLY JUST LIKE
A LITTLE FAMILY THING.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.609
- NO, I DON'T WANNA GO.
- OH.

05:08.709 --> 05:12.480
A KID'S BIRTHDAY PARTY--
NAH, I'M NOT THAT GUY.

05:12.580 --> 05:14.214
I GUESS IT'D BE
KIND OF BORING.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.749
- HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
- WHAT?

05:15.849 --> 05:17.418
I'LL BUY HIM
A BIRTHDAY GIFT.
HOW ABOUT THAT?

05:17.518 --> 05:19.753
LARRY, THAT WOULD
BE SO GREAT.

05:19.853 --> 05:22.523
- IF IT HELPS
WITH THE SEX, OF COURSE.
- IT WILL HELP WITH THE SEX.

05:22.623 --> 05:25.125
THEN I GET HIM A PRESENT.
WHAT'S THE DEBATE?

05:25.225 --> 05:27.027
YEAH, THERE'S NO DEBATE
WHATSOEVER.

05:27.127 --> 05:28.662
OF COURSE,
WHAT DO YOU--

05:28.762 --> 05:30.664
WHAT DO YOU GET
A KID LIKE THAT?

05:30.764 --> 05:33.166
HE LOVES EVERYTHING.
YOU MET HIM.

05:33.266 --> 05:34.702
CAN'T GET HIM A BASEBALL.

05:34.802 --> 05:36.303
SURE YOU CAN.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

05:36.404 --> 05:38.338
- CAN'T GET HIM A FOOTBALL.
- WHY NOT?

05:38.439 --> 05:41.742
ANYTHING--
IT CAN BE ANYTHING.
JUST GET HIM WHATEVER.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.987
- DID YOU SEE THAT?
- IT WAS MICHAEL J. FOX.

05:54.087 --> 05:57.357
YES. SEE THAT KIND OF
HEAD SHAKE HE JUST GAVE ME?

05:57.458 --> 05:59.660
HE'S UPSET BECAUSE
I SHUSHED HIM EARLIER.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.529
YOU KNOW HE HAS
A CONDITION.

06:01.629 --> 06:03.831
- HE SHAKES.
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

06:03.931 --> 06:05.733
MAYBE IT WAS
A PARKINSON'S SHAKE.

06:05.833 --> 06:07.768
IT COULD HAVE BEEN
A PARKINSON'S SHAKE.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.737
SO...

06:09.837 --> 06:13.173
WAS IT PISSED
OR PARKINSON'S?
I DON'T KNOW.

06:13.273 --> 06:15.743
I DON'T THINK THAT
IT'S THE KIND OF QUESTION
THAT YOU CAN ASK HIM.

06:15.843 --> 06:17.478
NO. HE LIVES RIGHT
UPSTAIRS FROM ME.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.379
- THIS COULD
GET AWKWARD.
- OH.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.682
MAYBE JUST SAY
"I'M SORRY I SHUSHED YOU."

06:21.782 --> 06:25.953
YEAH, OKAY.
GOOD IDEA.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.055
( elevator dings )

06:44.805 --> 06:46.974
( scoffs )

06:48.108 --> 06:50.377
- I'M SORRY?
- NO NO.

06:50.478 --> 06:52.412
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,
YOU HIT TWO FLOORS

06:52.513 --> 06:54.582
AND I'M IN A LITTLE BIT
OF A RUSH, THAT'S ALL.

06:54.682 --> 06:57.485
WHAT A TERRIBLE INCONVENIENCE.
MY GOD, I'M SO SORRY.

06:57.585 --> 07:01.288
WELL, AS A MATTER
OF FACT IT IS A LITTLE BIT
OF AN INCONVENIENCE, YES.

07:01.388 --> 07:03.591
YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M GOING.
I'M IN A LITTLE BIT OF A RUSH.

07:03.691 --> 07:05.759
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO WASTE 12 SECONDS
OF YOUR PRECIOUS TIME.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.661
- IT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT
THE 12 SECONDS, IS IT?
- WHAT IS IT?

07:07.761 --> 07:09.196
IT'S ABOUT THE FACT THAT
YOU HIT TWO BUTTONS.

07:09.296 --> 07:11.064
WHO DOESN'T KNOW WHAT FLOOR
THEY'RE GETTING OFF ON?

07:11.164 --> 07:12.900
I DECIDED TO GO
SOMEPLACE ELSE.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.469
I REALIZE THAT
THAT'S ILLEGAL IN YOUR
LITTLE WORLD, ISN'T IT?

07:15.569 --> 07:17.137
WHEN YOU REALIZED
YOU'D HIT THE WRONG FLOOR,

07:17.237 --> 07:19.573
- YOU JUST GET OFF ON 31,
GO UP TO 32.
- OH REALLY?

07:19.673 --> 07:21.642
- TAKE THE STAIRS.
- SUPPOSE I WANTED
TO GO TO 40.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.711
YOU MEAN BECAUSE
IT'S ONE FLIGHT NOW--

07:23.811 --> 07:26.880
- YOU WANNA GO TO 40 AS WELL?
- NO, I'M SAYING WHAT IF
I DID WANNA GO TO 40?

07:26.980 --> 07:28.782
WHY DON'T YOU GO TO 40?
THERE YOU GO.

07:28.882 --> 07:31.585
NOW YOU'RE
GOING TO 40 AS WELL.
YOU WANNA GO TO 33, 34?

07:31.685 --> 07:34.488
- HOW ABOUT THAT, HUH?
- I THINK I WANNA GO
TO 36 TOO.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.089
ALL RIGHT.
I CHANGED MY MIND.

07:36.189 --> 07:38.425
- I THINK I'M GONNA
GO TO 36 AND 37.
- GOOD GOOD.

07:38.526 --> 07:40.961
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I CHANGED MY MIND AGAIN.
- I THINK I'LL GO TO 39.

07:41.061 --> 07:43.430
- WHY DON'T I GO TO 43?
- I'LL GO TO 40.
I'LL GO TO 42.

07:43.531 --> 07:45.699
- OH MY GOODNESS, LOOK.
- THERE YOU GO.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.668
TERRIFIC!
NOW WE'RE GOING
TO EVERY FLOOR.

07:47.768 --> 07:49.537
YEAH, ENJOY THAT RIDE
UP TO 44.

07:49.637 --> 07:51.839
31-- I THINK
I'LL GET OUT HERE
AND TAKE THE STAIRS.

07:51.939 --> 07:53.841
- YEAH.
- ENJOY YOUR RIDE.

07:53.941 --> 07:55.876
ENJOY THE WALK!

07:58.546 --> 08:00.548
Larry:
ANYWAY, I JUST
WANTED TO TELL YOU

08:00.648 --> 08:02.950
THAT I HOPE YOU WEREN'T
UPSET ABOUT THE SHUSHING,

08:03.050 --> 08:04.718
BECAUSE A LOT
OF PEOPLE THINK--

08:04.818 --> 08:06.654
I'M NOT GONNA LIE TO YOU--
NOBODY LIKES TO BE SHUSHED.

08:06.754 --> 08:08.221
YEAH, NOBODY LIKES
TO BE SHUSHED.

08:08.321 --> 08:11.424
- MY KIDS--
I DON'T SHUSH MY KIDS.
- EXACTLY EXACTLY, YEAH.

08:11.525 --> 08:13.561
BECAUSE I DID NOTICE
BEFORE YOU LEFT

08:13.661 --> 08:15.829
YOU WERE LOOKING AT ME
AND YOU KIND OF,

08:15.929 --> 08:18.465
YOU KNOW,
SHOOK YOUR HEAD.

08:18.566 --> 08:19.967
UH, YEAH,
MY HEAD SHAKES, LARRY.

08:20.067 --> 08:22.903
I HAVE PARKINSON'S.
I-- I'M A HEAD-SHAKING FOOL.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.773
- I ALWAYS SHAKE.
- SO YOU'RE SAYING IT WAS
A PARKINSON'S SHAKE.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.875
YEAH, IT WASN'T
A LARRY'S SHAKE.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.843
GOT IT. OKAY.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.612
BUT SHE WAS PLAYING
BACKGROUND MUSIC.

08:31.712 --> 08:35.115
IT WAS NOT A PERFORMANCE.
I MEAN, PER SE.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.984
TO ME IT'S A LITTLE RUDE.

08:37.084 --> 08:38.986
IF I WENT TO SEE
ONE OF YOUR MOVIES

08:39.086 --> 08:41.789
AND I WAS TALKING,
YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T
LIKE IT.

08:41.889 --> 08:44.992
I'D BE SURPRISED.
WHERE ARE YOU GONNA
SEE ONE OF MY MOVIES?

08:45.092 --> 08:48.061
IT WAS LIKE 1985
LAST TIME I WAS IN A MOVIE.

08:48.161 --> 08:50.063
OKAY, IF I SAW ONE
OF YOUR MOVIES IN 1985,

08:50.163 --> 08:51.999
YOU WOULDN'T LIKE IT
IF I WAS TALKING.

08:52.099 --> 08:54.768
THIS IS GETTING
INTO TIME TRAVEL.
THIS IS GETTING WEIRD.

08:54.868 --> 08:58.572
SO JUST TO BE CLEAR,
YOU'RE NOT UPSET?

09:01.441 --> 09:03.911
- ( phone rings )
- LET ME GET THAT.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.913
I'LL BE BACK
IN TWO SHAKES.

09:10.651 --> 09:12.920
( sighs )

09:21.695 --> 09:24.031
WHAT THE FUCK?
LAR, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:24.131 --> 09:26.667
OH, I WAS JUST DRAWING
A HITLER MUSTACHE.

09:26.767 --> 09:29.169
- ON MY FATHER-IN-LAW.
THAT'S MY FATHER-IN-LAW.
- THAT'S YOUR FATHER-IN-LAW?

09:29.269 --> 09:31.371
YEAH, HE'S A BUSINESSMAN.
HE'S ON "BUSINESSWEEK"
MAGAZINE.

09:31.471 --> 09:34.307
YOU'RE KIDDING!
WHAT THE HELL IS HE DOING
ON THE COVER OF A MAGAZINE?

09:34.407 --> 09:37.444
- WELL, HE'S THE FUEHRER NOW.
- OH MY GOD, I'M SORRY.

09:37.544 --> 09:40.213
I JUST LIKE TO SEE
WHAT PEOPLE LOOK LIKE
WITH HITLER MUSTACHES.

09:40.313 --> 09:42.349
HE LOOKS LIKE HITLER.
THE MYSTERY IS SOLVED.

09:42.449 --> 09:44.084
MY FATHER-IN-LAW
LOOKS LIKE HITLER.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.453
I'VE GOTTA GET
RID OF THIS BECAUSE
HE'S COMING OVER HERE.

09:46.553 --> 09:48.421
- AND IF HE SEES THIS...
- I'M SORRY AGAIN.

09:48.521 --> 09:49.857
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.759
CAN I GET YOU A SODA
OR SOMETHING, LARRY?

09:51.859 --> 09:53.493
OH SURE.
THAT'D BE GREAT.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.729
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
THE THING IS

09:55.829 --> 09:59.299
HITLER REALLY RUINED
THAT MUSTACHE FOR EVERYBODY.

09:59.399 --> 10:01.468
BECAUSE IT'S REALLY--
IT'S AN INTERESTING MUSTACHE,

10:01.568 --> 10:04.137
AND NOW NOBODY COULD
WEAR IT, YOU KNOW.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.605
OH, THANKS.

10:05.706 --> 10:08.375
OH JESUS CHRIST!

10:08.475 --> 10:12.045
- WHAT THE HELL?
- YOU WANT--

10:12.145 --> 10:14.014
DID YOU SHAKE THAT UP
ON PURPOSE?

10:14.114 --> 10:17.184
PARKINSON'S.

10:23.090 --> 10:24.825
I THINK
THE SHIRT'S RUINED.

10:24.925 --> 10:27.227
I'M NOT REALLY
SURPRISED, MAN.
HE HAS PARKINSON'S.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.562
SO HE'S GOT PARKINSON'S.
OF COURSE IT'S PARKINSON'S.

10:29.663 --> 10:31.198
- YEAH.
- HE WAS SHAKING.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.966
HE WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING
LIKE THAT ON PURPOSE.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.968
MICHAEL J. FOX?
NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS.

10:35.068 --> 10:37.470
BUT HE SHAKES, RIGHT?
HE HANDS YOU A SODA
THAT'S SHAKEN.

10:37.570 --> 10:39.072
HE CAN'T STOP
FUCKIN' SHAKING.

10:39.172 --> 10:40.941
- SO YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME.
- I'M JUST NOT BUYING IT.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.976
SEE THAT FUCKIN' MILK
YOU GOT IN YOUR HAND
RIGHT NOW?

10:43.076 --> 10:45.212
YOU HAND THAT MAN
A CARTON OF FUCKIN' MILK--
GUESS WHAT.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.815
- IT'S GONNA BE
A FUCKIN' MILKSHAKE.
- THAT WAS NOT PARKINSON'S.

10:47.915 --> 10:49.416
THANK GOD HE DIDN'T
HAND YOU HIS DICK.

10:49.516 --> 10:51.418
HE COULD'VE BEEN
SHAKING AND SHOOK
THAT DICK UP,

10:51.518 --> 10:53.787
HANDED YOU THE DICK,
AND THE DICK SHOT
SPERM IN YOUR FACE.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.388
YEAH, BUT WHY WOULD
HE HAND ME A DICK?

10:55.488 --> 10:57.424
- I MEAN AS AN EXAMPLE.
- WHAT KIND OF EXAMPLE IS THAT?

10:57.524 --> 10:59.860
I'M JUST COMPARING IT
TO OTHER THINGS YOU CAN
SHAKE UP, RIGHT?

10:59.960 --> 11:03.964
- WITH PARKINSON'S, RIGHT?
- YOU JUST LIVE IN A TOTAL
DICK WORLD, DON'T YOU?

11:04.064 --> 11:05.799
- IT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE.
- RIGHT?

11:05.899 --> 11:10.437
( loud thumping )

11:12.639 --> 11:14.775
WHAT'S THAT?

11:14.875 --> 11:17.778
IS THAT PARKINSON'S, HMM?

11:17.878 --> 11:20.748
- YOU THINK
THAT'S PARKINSON'S?
- SHIT. WOW.

11:20.848 --> 11:24.484
( thumping continues )

11:24.584 --> 11:26.887
- HE'S PISSED.
- HE'S PISSED.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.358
( knocking )

11:31.458 --> 11:35.162
HI. OH, LOOK AT--
HEY, GREG!

11:35.262 --> 11:37.230
LARRY BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY.

11:37.330 --> 11:40.300
- GREG!
- HE'S GONNA BE SO EXCITED.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.435
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

11:42.535 --> 11:44.204
HMM.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.439
OH MY GOD.
LET ME CHECK.
WHAT IS IT?

11:46.539 --> 11:48.175
- WHAT IS IT?
- WHAT IS IT?

11:48.275 --> 11:50.643
IT'S A SEWING MACHINE.
IT'S A SEWING MACHINE.

11:50.744 --> 11:52.712
( screaming )

11:52.813 --> 11:54.848
IT'S A SEWING MACHINE!

11:54.948 --> 11:57.284
OH MY GOD, I'M GONNA MAKE
THE "GONE WITH THE WIND"
COSTUME.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.319
"MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS,"
"THE WIZARD OF OZ."

11:59.419 --> 12:01.521
- YOU'RE GONNA MAKE
"THE WIZARD OF OZ" COSTUME?
- YES!

12:01.621 --> 12:03.423
- WHICH ONE?
- DOROTHY.

12:03.523 --> 12:04.958
I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT,
I LOVE IT!

12:05.058 --> 12:07.094
( kisses )
THANK YOU, LORD.

12:07.194 --> 12:09.196
"THANK YOU, LORD"?
THANK YOU, LARRY.

12:09.296 --> 12:11.899
- THANK YOU, LARRY.
- YOU'RE WELCOME, GREG.

12:11.999 --> 12:14.935
( screams )
NANA, NANA!

12:17.404 --> 12:20.841
- A SEWING MACHINE?
- YEAH. HE LOVED IT.

12:20.941 --> 12:23.276
WHAT, ARE YOU TRYING
TO TURN HIM GAY?

12:25.946 --> 12:29.983
HE IS A HAPPY, HEALTHY,
NORMAL SEVEN-YEAR-OLD BOY.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.785
WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

12:31.885 --> 12:34.922
I THINK HE MIGHT BE GAY.

12:41.494 --> 12:45.632
( loud thumping )

12:45.732 --> 12:48.401
( sighs )

12:48.501 --> 12:50.770
LEON! YOU UP?

12:50.871 --> 12:52.305
YEAH, I'M UP.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.041
THIS DUDE IS OUT
OF FUCKING CONTROL
RIGHT NOW.

12:54.141 --> 12:55.742
WHAT IS GOING ON
WITH HIM?

12:55.843 --> 12:57.677
ALL THIS FUCKIN'
CLOMPING AROUND
ALL FUCKIN' NIGHT?

12:57.777 --> 13:01.114
- I CAN'T FUCKIN' SLEEP
LIKE THIS, MAN.
- I KNOW. GOD!

13:01.214 --> 13:03.116
YOU'D BETTER HOUND
THIS DUDE, MAN.

13:03.216 --> 13:05.085
YOU'D BETTER GO UP THERE
AND HANDLE THIS FUCKIN' GUY.

13:05.185 --> 13:07.687
THIS SHIT DON'T GO DOWN
IN A BLACK NEIGHBORHOOD.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

13:07.787 --> 13:09.356
ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA
GO UP THERE.

13:09.456 --> 13:10.891
UNLESS YOU WANT TO.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.926
IF I GO UP THERE,
I WILL KILL THIS
MOTHERFUCKER.

13:13.026 --> 13:15.695
MICHAEL J. FOX ABOUT TO BE
MICHAEL J. FUCKED-UP
IN A MINUTE.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.430
BUT IF YOU GO UP THERE,
YOU AND HIM--

13:17.530 --> 13:19.032
THAT'S A FAIR FIGHT
AND SHIT.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.268
- YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
- HOW IS THAT A FAIR FIGHT?

13:21.368 --> 13:23.003
SHAKING MOTHERFUCKERS
LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW,

13:23.103 --> 13:24.571
LITTLE KIDS AND SHIT,
OLD PEOPLE,

13:24.671 --> 13:26.539
MOTHERFUCKERS WHO CAN'T
DEFEND THEMSELVES, AND YOU--

13:26.639 --> 13:27.807
THAT'S PERFECT.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.776
YOU TWO FACE OFF--
THAT'S JUST EVEN STEVEN.

13:29.877 --> 13:32.245
- THAT'S NOT EVEN STEVEN.
- THAT'S EVEN FUCKIN' STEVEN,
LARRY.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.181
YOU DON'T THINK I CAN GET
THE BETTER OF HIM IN A FIGHT?

13:34.281 --> 13:36.616
THAT SHAKING SHIT
MIGHT COME IN HANDY.
I DON'T FUCKIN' KNOW.

13:36.716 --> 13:38.451
RIGHT?
YOU DON'T KNOW THIS
MOTHERFUCKER'S SKILLS.

13:38.551 --> 13:39.619
- ALL RIGHT.
- RIGHT?

13:39.719 --> 13:40.954
ALL RIGHT,
YOU WATCH ME, OKAY?

13:41.054 --> 13:42.589
- I WANNA SEE THIS SHIT.
- YOU WATCH ME.

13:42.689 --> 13:45.859
THIS SHIT DON'T HAPPEN
IN A BLACK NEIGHBORHOOD.
I'M TELLING YOU.

13:47.594 --> 13:48.929
( knocking )

13:51.664 --> 13:53.533
- HEY, LARRY.
- HEY.

13:53.633 --> 13:57.037
UM...

13:57.137 --> 13:59.206
WHAT'S GOING ON
UP HERE?

13:59.306 --> 14:01.341
WHY? WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"WHAT'S GOING ON"?

14:01.441 --> 14:04.044
THERE'S A LOT OF CLOMPING
ON THE FLOOR.

14:04.144 --> 14:06.779
- IT'S KEEPING ME UP.
- OH OH, IT'S THE BOOTS,
THE BOOTS.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.415
YEAH YEAH.
MY FEET CRAMP.

14:08.515 --> 14:12.052
IT'S CALLED DYSTONIA
AND I HAVE TO WEAR
STIFF SHOES

14:12.152 --> 14:13.620
TO KEEP THEM
FROM CRAMPING.

14:13.720 --> 14:16.189
IT'S IN MY BOOK.
IT'S CHAPTER ONE.
YOU SHOULD READ IT.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.825
AT THE VERY LEAST
IT'LL HELP YOU
GET TO SLEEP.

14:18.926 --> 14:21.294
YOUR FEET ARE CRAMPING?
IS THIS A NEW THING?

14:21.394 --> 14:24.031
NO. THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON
FOR ABOUT 20 YEARS NOW, LAR.

14:24.131 --> 14:25.565
OH REALLY?
HOW COME I HAVEN'T HEARD
THE CLOMPING BEFORE?

14:25.665 --> 14:27.700
YOU HAVEN'T LIVED HERE.
YOU'VE LIVED IN CALIFORNIA.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.003
I'VE BEEN LIVING
HERE FOR OVER A MONTH.
I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY CLOMPING.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.239
- WHAT AM I,
BULLSHITTING YOU?
- I DON'T KNOW.

14:32.339 --> 14:33.974
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I THINK.
YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT
I THINK, FOX?

14:34.074 --> 14:35.442
- I'M HANGING ON IT.
- ARE YOU?

14:35.542 --> 14:37.644
I THINK YOU'RE UPSET
ABOUT THE SHUSHING.

14:37.744 --> 14:40.447
I THINK YOU WERE PISSED OFF
ABOUT THE HITLER MUSTACHE
ON YOUR FATHER-IN-LAW.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.950
I THINK YOU SHOOK UP
THAT CAN OF SODA ON PURPOSE.

14:43.050 --> 14:44.451
AND I THINK
YOU'RE CLOMPING NOW

14:44.551 --> 14:47.020
AND YOU'VE MADE UP
SOME BULLSHIT EXCUSE
ABOUT YOUR FEET,

14:47.120 --> 14:48.956
AND IT'S ALL UNDER
THE GUISE OF PARKINSON'S.

14:49.056 --> 14:51.424
THAT'S WHAT I THINK.
HUH?

14:51.524 --> 14:54.194
I THOUGHT I WAS
THE SICKEST GUY ON THIS BLOCK,
BUT YOU'RE THE NEW CHAMP.

14:54.294 --> 14:56.229
I HAVE A SICKNESS
IN MY BRAIN.

14:56.329 --> 14:58.031
YOU HAVE A SICKNESS
IN YOUR MIND.

14:58.131 --> 15:00.833
- YOUR MIND, IT'S GONE OVER.
- OH, HAS IT?

15:00.934 --> 15:03.003
IT'S FASCINATING IF IT WASN'T
SO FUCKING TRAGIC.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.005
HUH. SO YOU DENY
THE WHOLE THING?

15:05.105 --> 15:07.207
IT'S ALL PARKINSON'S, LARRY.
IT'S ALL PARKINSON'S.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.576
- THE HEAD SHAKE AT THE BAR?
- PARKINSON'S.

15:09.676 --> 15:12.245
- THE SODA?
- PARKINSON'S.

15:12.345 --> 15:15.748
- THE CLOMPING?
- PARKINSON'S.

15:15.848 --> 15:17.217
ARE YOU SURE?

15:17.317 --> 15:21.154
YEAH, LARRY,
I'M DEAD CERTAIN.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.600
OKAY.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.908
- ALL RIGHT,
THERE YOU GO.
- Susie: HELLO?

15:42.009 --> 15:43.410
- HEY.
- HEY, LAR,

15:43.510 --> 15:47.347
- WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU THINKING?
- WHAT?

15:47.447 --> 15:48.848
YOU GIVE
A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD KID--

15:48.948 --> 15:51.118
A BOY-- A SEWING MACHINE
AS A GIFT?

15:51.218 --> 15:53.286
- YEAH. SO WHAT?
- TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE.

15:53.386 --> 15:55.688
NO, NOT INAPPROPRIATE.
HE LOVED THE GIFT.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.058
HE WENT IN THAT ROOM,
FIGURED OUT IN TWO MINUTES

15:58.158 --> 15:59.659
HOW TO WORK
THAT SEWING MACHINE.

15:59.759 --> 16:01.894
AND HE WAS WORKING
ON A FRILLY THING
IMMEDIATELY.

16:01.995 --> 16:04.131
I DON'T LIKE
THE IMPLICATION,
ALL RIGHT?

16:04.231 --> 16:06.633
- IT'S NOT AN IMPLICATION.
- HE'S SEVEN.

16:06.733 --> 16:10.237
BEING GAY MEANS
THAT YOU'RE ATTRACTED TO
THE PERSON OF THE SAME SEX.

16:10.337 --> 16:13.273
HE'S TOO YOUNG
TO BE ATTRACTED
TO ANYBODY.

16:13.373 --> 16:16.409
HE WILL BE GAY.
HE'S JUST-- HE'S PRE-GAY.

16:16.509 --> 16:18.545
I DON'T KNOW
THAT YOU CAN MAKE
THAT ASSUMPTION.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.280
I THINK
IT WAS AN INSULT

16:20.380 --> 16:24.484
AND I THINK YOU'D BETTER GET
ANOTHER FUCKING GIFT, OKAY?

16:26.286 --> 16:27.987
WHY DOES SHE STICK HER NOSE
INTO EVERYTHING?

16:28.088 --> 16:29.989
WHAT, I GOTTA GET THE KID
ANOTHER GIFT NOW?

16:30.090 --> 16:33.326
- YOU GOT TO GET
HIM ANOTHER GIFT.
- WHAT AM I GONNA GET HIM?

16:33.426 --> 16:36.229
- I HAVE NOTHING TO GET HIM.
- WHAT ABOUT A SLINKY?

16:36.329 --> 16:38.531
- A SLINKY'S ALWAYS--
- A SLINKY?

16:38.631 --> 16:41.901
- EH, THAT'S PRETTY GAY.
- WELL, YOU'RE HANDLING A BALL.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.636
- Both: YOU'RE HANDLING BALLS.
- YEAH.

16:43.736 --> 16:45.738
- SO THIS IS THE WAY--
- THAT'S WHAT A SLINKY IS,
REALLY.

16:45.838 --> 16:48.375
- Both: IT'S HANDLING BALLS.
- YES, THAT'S WHAT--
MY POINT EXACTLY.

16:48.475 --> 16:51.078
- SO IT'S GAY.
- I MEAN, MAYBE ROLLER SKATES?

16:51.178 --> 16:53.046
NAH, THAT'S GOT
THE ICE SKATING THING.

16:53.146 --> 16:55.048
YOU DON'T WANNA
EVEN TOUCH THAT.

16:55.148 --> 16:58.318
- A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT.
- OH, THAT'S NOT BAD.

16:58.418 --> 16:59.919
NO SEXUALITY INVOLVED
UNLESS YOU GET HIM A HARP.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.055
YOU WANNA KEEP AWAY
FROM THE FLUTE, I THINK.

17:02.155 --> 17:04.191
- NO FLUTE, NO HARP.
- OKAY.

17:04.291 --> 17:06.759
- IT'S YOUR TURN.
- OKAY. THERE YOU GO.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.996
YOU REALIZE THAT MIGHT'VE BEEN
THE DUMBEST MOVE YOU COULD
HAVE POSSIBLY DONE?

17:10.097 --> 17:11.664
SERIOUSLY, I'M NOT
THINKING STRAIGHT.

17:11.764 --> 17:14.834
I'M SO-- HE'S KEEPING ME UP--
MICHAEL J. FOX-- EVERY NIGHT,

17:14.934 --> 17:16.303
CLOMPING AROUND UPSTAIRS.

17:16.403 --> 17:18.105
- STILL CLOMPING?
- YES. I CAN'T SLEEP.

17:18.205 --> 17:20.006
- MICHAEL?
- YEAH.

17:20.107 --> 17:21.308
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
THAT TRACY--

17:21.408 --> 17:23.310
HIS WIFE TRACY POLLAN--
SHE'S A SAINT.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.078
WHAT A RELATIONSHIP
THOSE TWO HAVE, HUH?

17:25.178 --> 17:26.613
I KNOW.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.848
- SUCH DEVOTION.
IT'S INCREDIBLE.
- Larry: YEAH.

17:28.948 --> 17:32.051
AS A CYNIC IT KIND OF
SICKENS ME, BUT HE'D TAKE
A BULLET FOR HER.

17:32.152 --> 17:34.121
HE WOULD TAKE
A BULLET FOR HER.

17:34.221 --> 17:36.289
- TRUE LOVE.
- Jeff: YEAH.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.225
- HOW ABOUT YOU, JEFF?
- WHAT?

17:38.325 --> 17:40.160
WOULD YOU TAKE
A BULLET FOR ME?

17:40.260 --> 17:41.928
OF COURSE I'D TAKE
A BULLET FOR YOU.

17:42.028 --> 17:44.531
WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING?
WITHOUT A DOUBT.

17:44.631 --> 17:47.534
- YOU THINK HE WOULD?
- HE JUST SAID HE WOULD.

17:47.634 --> 17:50.670
SAYING AND DOING--
TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.
I DOUBT IT.

17:50.770 --> 17:53.773
- YOU KNOW
WHAT PEOPLE SAY...
- Jeff: WHAT?

17:53.873 --> 17:56.309
- ...WHEN YOU GUYS
LEAVE A ROOM?
- WHAT DO THEY SAY?

17:56.409 --> 17:58.778
- ( tisks )
"POOR BASTARD."
- OH JEEZ.

17:58.878 --> 18:01.581
Susie:
YOU CAN LEAVE NOW, LARRY.
GET THE FUCK OUT!

18:01.681 --> 18:03.416
I'M GOING HOME.

18:07.019 --> 18:08.821
SEE YOU, FOLKS.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.523
- HEY, JOHN!
- HEY, LARRY.

18:10.623 --> 18:12.259
- HOW ARE YOU DOING, MAN?
- PRETTY GOOD. HOW'S IT GOING?

18:12.359 --> 18:14.294
REAL GOOD. THANKS FOR
THE YANKEES TICKETS.

18:14.394 --> 18:15.795
- ANYTIME, MAN.
- I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

18:15.895 --> 18:17.564
- ANYTIME.
- SEE YOU AROUND.

18:20.967 --> 18:22.435
( scoffs )

18:22.535 --> 18:25.572
WAS THAT, UH...
PARKINSON'S?

18:25.672 --> 18:29.742
NO, THAT WASN'T PARKINSON'S.
THAT WAS JUST BAD TIMING.

18:29.842 --> 18:30.977
- BAD TIMING?
- YEAH.

18:31.077 --> 18:32.445
OH OKAY, SO THAT ONE
WASN'T PARKIN--

18:32.545 --> 18:35.348
BY THE WAY, STILL A LOT
OF CLOMPING I'M HEARING.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.684
- WHAT'S GOING--
- YOU NEED TO TAKE IT UP
WITH THE BOARD.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.586
- I AM GONNA TAKE IT UP
WITH THE BOARD.
- THAT'S GREAT.

18:39.686 --> 18:42.189
- LET ME KNOW HOW
THAT WORKS OUT FOR YOU.
- I WILL. I CAN'T SLEEP.

18:42.289 --> 18:44.457
MR. FOX, IS THERE
A PROBLEM HERE?

18:44.557 --> 18:47.126
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
THERE IS A BIT OF A PROBLEM.

18:47.227 --> 18:49.229
YOU NEED ME TO CALL
THE POLICE?

18:49.329 --> 18:52.165
- NO, I THINK
YOU CAN HANDLE IT.
- ALL RIGHT.

18:52.265 --> 18:53.933
EDDIE, GET MR. FOX
A CAB, PLEASE.
THANK YOU.

18:54.033 --> 18:58.738
- THANK YOU, EDDIE.
THANKS, JOHN.
- YOU GOT IT, MR. FOX.

18:58.838 --> 19:01.274
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

19:01.374 --> 19:03.276
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.

19:03.376 --> 19:04.911
HE BUMPED INTO ME
ON PURPOSE.

19:05.011 --> 19:06.579
- DID YOU SEE THAT?
- I DID SEE IT.

19:06.679 --> 19:08.581
- HE HAS PARKINSON'S DISEASE.
- I KNOW HE HAS PARKINSON'S.

19:08.681 --> 19:11.684
HE'S USING IT
TO HARASS ME, OKAY?
I SWEAR TO GOD.

19:11.784 --> 19:14.487
HE SHOOK UP SODA
AND SPILLED IT
ALL OVER ME.

19:14.587 --> 19:17.056
- HE'S CLOMPING AROUND--
- HERE'S THE DEAL.
HERE'S THE DEAL.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.892
YOU CAN BUMP INTO
ANY TENANT YOU WANT
IN THIS BUILDING, ALL RIGHT?

19:19.992 --> 19:21.661
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT.

19:21.761 --> 19:25.097
BUT YOU DON'T TOUCH MR. FOX.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

19:25.198 --> 19:28.167
YOU TOUCH HIM AGAIN,
ME AND YOU GOT A PROBLEM.

19:28.268 --> 19:30.670
OH, YOU DON'T TOUCH
MICHAEL J. FOX.

19:30.770 --> 19:33.172
OH YEAH.
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, OKAY?

19:33.273 --> 19:34.741
I'M VERY SYMPATHETIC
TO THE PARKINSON'S!

19:34.841 --> 19:37.377
BUT JUST HAVING PARKINSON'S
DOESN'T GIVE YOU CARTE BLANCHE

19:37.477 --> 19:40.847
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THE NON-PARKINSON'S!

19:45.718 --> 19:47.587
Larry:
HONEST TO GOD,
I CAN'T SLEEP.

19:47.687 --> 19:51.090
HE'S BANGING ON MY CEILING
WITH THESE SPECIAL SHOES.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.959
HE'S WEARING
COMBAT BOOTS.

19:53.059 --> 19:54.494
AND YESTERDAY
HE SHOVED ME

19:54.594 --> 19:56.463
WHEN I WAS COMING
OUT OF THE ELEVATOR.

19:56.563 --> 19:58.965
SHOVED ME.
MICHAEL J. FOX

19:59.065 --> 20:01.968
SHOVED ME, OKAY?

20:02.068 --> 20:04.070
MR. DAVID, ARE YOU
AWARE OF THE FACT

20:04.170 --> 20:06.339
THAT MICHAEL J. FOX
HAS PARKINSON'S DISEASE?

20:06.439 --> 20:08.241
OF COURSE I'M AWARE
OF THE PARKINSON'S.

20:08.341 --> 20:10.209
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT HE'S DOING?

20:10.310 --> 20:11.711
NOBODY UNDERSTANDS THIS.

20:11.811 --> 20:15.515
HE'S USING THE PARKINSON'S
TO DO WHATEVER HE WANTS.

20:15.615 --> 20:17.717
YOU THINK MR. PARKINSON,
THE FIRST GUY WHO HAD
PARKINSON'S--

20:17.817 --> 20:19.686
YOU THINK HE WOULD LIKE
WHAT HE'S SEEING HERE?

20:19.786 --> 20:23.356
MR. PARKINSON WOULD
BE APPALLED IF HE KNEW
HOW MR. FOX IS BEHAVING.

20:23.456 --> 20:26.459
MR. DAVID,
I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU

20:26.559 --> 20:28.395
ABOUT THE INCIDENT
IN THE ELEVATOR.

20:28.495 --> 20:30.497
THAT GUY TOLD YOU
ABOUT THAT?

20:30.597 --> 20:33.366
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
HE CAME TO THE BOARD--

20:33.466 --> 20:35.435
( mocking )
"I GOT IN THE ELEVATOR
WITH LARRY DAVID"?

20:35.535 --> 20:37.203
OH, COME ON.
GIVE ME A BREAK.

20:37.304 --> 20:39.806
MR. DAVID, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO PLAY WITH THE BUTTONS
ON THE ELEVATOR.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.309
I DIDN'T PLAY WITH THE BUTTONS.
HE PLAYED WITH THE BUTTONS.

20:42.409 --> 20:44.511
( indistinct whispering )

20:47.647 --> 20:51.884
MR. DAVID, I'M AFRAID
IT'S THE DECISION
OF THIS BOARD,

20:51.984 --> 20:55.788
IN VIEW OF THE TWO OFFENSES,
THAT YOU ARE ON PROBATION.

20:55.888 --> 20:59.826
I THINK I DON'T
HAVE TO EXPLAIN
THAT A THIRD OFFENSE

20:59.926 --> 21:02.595
WILL MEAN YOU WILL BE ASKED
TO LEAVE THE BUILDING.

21:02.695 --> 21:05.432
IT'S NOT FAIR.

21:05.532 --> 21:09.836
WELL, PERHAPS YOU COULD
MAKE AMENDS TO MR. FOX.

21:09.936 --> 21:12.138
HE'S HOLDING A FUNDRAISER

21:12.238 --> 21:13.873
TOMORROW AFTERNOON
IN OUR COURTYARD

21:13.973 --> 21:16.108
AND IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING
IF YOU SHOWED UP.

21:16.208 --> 21:18.077
AND A CONTRIBUTION

21:18.177 --> 21:21.213
TO THE PARKINSON'S CHARITY
WOULD PROBABLY GO A LONG WAY

21:21.314 --> 21:24.116
TOWARDS RESOLVING THIS.

21:24.216 --> 21:26.586
HOW MUCH
ARE YOU THINKING?

21:26.686 --> 21:28.688
$10,000.

21:37.930 --> 21:39.499
HEY, LOOK AT THAT.

21:39.599 --> 21:41.868
- OH, HEY.
- HEY!

21:41.968 --> 21:43.302
- HUH?
- HI, LAR.

21:43.403 --> 21:45.472
- HOW ARE YOU?
WHAT--
- WHAT IS IT?

21:45.572 --> 21:47.974
IT'S ANOTHER PRESENT
FOR GREG.

21:48.074 --> 21:50.910
- OH!
- VERY GOOD.

21:51.010 --> 21:53.446
- IT'S BEAUTIFULLY WRAPPED.
- I HEARD THE VOICE
OF THE PEOPLE AND,

21:53.546 --> 21:55.214
LIKE ANY GREAT LEADER,
I RESPONDED.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.716
- WHAT DID YOU GET?
- VERY WELL DONE.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.351
WELL, THAT'S REALLY
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

21:58.451 --> 21:59.719
Susie:
HOW IS IT NONE
OF MY BUSINESS?

21:59.819 --> 22:01.821
I WANNA KNOW IF YOU'VE
FUCKED UP AGAIN.

22:01.921 --> 22:04.657
I GOT A GOOD GIFT AND
I'D LIKE TO SURPRISE HIM,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

22:04.757 --> 22:06.793
HE COULD BE SURPRISED.
WE DON'T NEED TO BE
SURPRISED, OKAY?

22:06.893 --> 22:08.160
YEAH, I DON'T WANNA
BE SURPRISED, LARRY.

22:08.260 --> 22:11.364
- IT'S A VIOLIN.
- OH.

22:11.464 --> 22:13.633
- THAT IS GREAT.
- YOU LIKE THAT, HUH?

22:13.733 --> 22:15.368
HE'S BEEN ASKING
TO TAKE LESSONS.

22:15.468 --> 22:18.004
- AND SHE'S A MUSICIAN.
- YEAH, SO DUH.

22:18.104 --> 22:19.572
- WOW. ALL RIGHT.
- YEAH.

22:19.672 --> 22:21.240
THAT SEWING MACHINE'S
GOTTA GO.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.709
YEAH. I'LL BOX IT UP.
I'LL GIVE IT BACK TO YOU.

22:22.809 --> 22:25.044
I DON'T WANT IT.
WHAT AM I GONNA DO WITH IT?

22:25.144 --> 22:27.814
- YOU CAN TAKE IT BACK.
I DON'T WANT IT IN THE HOUSE.
- I'M NOT TAKING IT BACK.

22:27.914 --> 22:30.316
- IT'S YOUR SEWING MACHINE.
IT'S NOT MINE.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

22:30.417 --> 22:32.552
YOU MAKE SUCH
A BIG MEGILLAH
OVER EVERYTHING.

22:32.652 --> 22:33.986
I'M A MEGILLAH?
WHY AM I A MEGILLAH?

22:34.086 --> 22:36.122
I HAVE TO BUY TWO GIFTS NOW
AND TAKE ONE BACK?

22:36.222 --> 22:38.257
- WILL YOU GIVE THE KID
THE FUCKING VIOLIN?
- I'LL BE HAPPY TO.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.159
AND BE GONE WITH YOU.
ASSHOLE.

22:40.259 --> 22:42.629
GREG!
COME HERE, HONEY.

22:42.729 --> 22:44.130
- HI, SWEETIE!
- HEY!

22:44.230 --> 22:45.598
LOOK WHO'S HERE.
IT'S LARRY.

22:45.698 --> 22:48.200
- HEYA, GREG.
- OH, I LIKE YOUR BAG.

22:48.300 --> 22:50.069
- YOU DO?
- YEAH. WHERE IS IT FROM?

22:50.169 --> 22:52.271
- YEAH, IT'S COOL,
ISN'T IT-- THE FRINGE?
- YEAH.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.674
- GUESS WHAT.
- WHAT?

22:54.774 --> 22:57.043
LARRY GOT YOU
A PRESENT TO REPLACE
THE SEWING MACHINE.

22:57.143 --> 22:58.478
I LOVE
MY SEWING MACHINE.

22:58.578 --> 23:00.547
- Larry: WHAT?
- I LOVE MY SEWING MACHINE.

23:00.647 --> 23:03.115
OH, HE LOVES
HIS SEWING MACHINE.

23:03.215 --> 23:06.018
- AND I MADE SOMETHING
FOR YOU, SUSIE.
- YOU MADE SOMETHING FOR ME?

23:06.118 --> 23:08.855
OH, BY THE WAY,
HE LIKES THE SEWING--
HE WANTS TO KEEP IT.

23:08.955 --> 23:11.323
- HE MADE SOMETHING FOR YOU.
- WHAT IS THAT, HONEY?

23:11.424 --> 23:13.493
- I MADE YOU A PILLOW SHAM.
- A PILLOW SHAM?

23:13.593 --> 23:15.462
A PILLOW SHAM!
HE MADE YOU
A PILLOW SHAM.

23:15.562 --> 23:16.663
- OH MY GOD.
- YOU MADE THAT?

23:16.763 --> 23:18.364
- LOOK AT THIS.
- UNBELIEVABLE.

23:18.465 --> 23:20.867
- THAT'S REALLY NICE
STITCHING.
- THIS KID--

23:20.967 --> 23:23.002
WHAT THE--?

23:23.102 --> 23:26.305
WHAT?
WHERE DID YOU LEARN
ABOUT THIS SYMBOL?

23:26.405 --> 23:28.240
LARRY TAUGHT ME
HOW TO MAKE A SWASTIKA.

23:28.340 --> 23:30.543
HE WROTE IT
ON A PIECE OF PAPER.

23:30.643 --> 23:32.078
- HE WAS DOODLING, LIKE,
THIS EVIL MAN...
- GREG.

23:32.178 --> 23:33.813
...WHO HATED JEWS.

23:33.913 --> 23:36.215
- WHAT WAS HIS NAME
AGAIN, LARRY?
- HITLER?

23:36.315 --> 23:37.950
HITLER!
YEAH, HITLER.

23:38.050 --> 23:39.952
- Susie: LARRY TAUGHT YOU
HOW TO MAKE THIS?
- NO, I WAS--

23:40.052 --> 23:41.954
- YOU TAUGHT HIM
HOW TO MAKE A SWASTIKA?
- I DID NOT.

23:42.054 --> 23:44.423
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU THINKING?
- I WAS DOODLING!

23:44.524 --> 23:45.992
- ON A PILLOW SHAM?
- I WAS JUST DOODLING.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.760
YOU THINK THIS IS
AN APPROPRIATE SYMBOL

23:47.860 --> 23:50.897
- TO BE PETIT POINTING ON--
- SUSIE, LOOK OUT!

23:50.997 --> 23:52.364
AHH!

23:52.465 --> 23:53.432
( screams )

23:53.533 --> 23:55.602
- JEFF! JEFF!
- ( groaning )

23:55.702 --> 23:58.070
ARE YOU OKAY?
HONEY, ARE YOU OKAY?

23:58.170 --> 23:59.872
I TOOK A BULLET FOR YOU.

23:59.972 --> 24:02.475
WELL, IT WAS A BIKE
TECHNICALLY.

24:06.913 --> 24:08.581
Michael:
GOOD AFTERNOON.

24:08.681 --> 24:10.783
I WANNA WELCOME YOU ALL HERE
AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT

24:10.883 --> 24:13.052
OF THE MICHAEL J. FOX FOUNDATION
FOR PARKINSON'S RESEARCH.

24:13.152 --> 24:15.555
IT'S REALLY GREAT
TO SEE YOU.

24:15.655 --> 24:17.423
AND A VERY SPECIAL
THANK YOU

24:17.524 --> 24:20.192
AND A VERY WARM WELCOME
TO MAYOR BLOOMBERG...

24:20.292 --> 24:25.832
- Woman: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- ...WHO'S WITH US TODAY,

24:25.932 --> 24:28.167
SUPPORTING US AS HE HAS
SINCE OUR INCEPTION

24:28.267 --> 24:30.803
AND THROUGHOUT OUR PROGRESS
TOWARD A CURE FOR PARKINSON'S.

24:30.903 --> 24:34.674
- BEFORE I GO
MUCH FURTHER...
- AH, HEY.

24:34.774 --> 24:36.676
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

24:36.776 --> 24:38.711
- MY SIDE IS JUST KILLING ME.
- WHAT A SHAME.

24:38.811 --> 24:41.648
- OH GOD, IT'S TERRIBLE.
- I THINK YOU SAVED HER LIFE.

24:41.748 --> 24:43.650
- SHE OWES ME.
- YEAH.

24:43.750 --> 24:45.552
WELL, I GOT A DOCTOR'S
APPOINTMENT THIS AFTERNOON.

24:45.652 --> 24:47.319
I'LL GET THE WHOLE THING
STRAIGHTENED OUT.

24:47.419 --> 24:49.889
- SO WHAT DID YOU
END UP GETTING GREG?
- I GOT HIM A--

24:49.989 --> 24:52.792
- HEY! SHH!
- Michael: AND WE FIGURE
WE HAVE TO TACKLE ROAD BLOCKS

24:52.892 --> 24:54.827
- THAT OTHER FUNDERS
HAVE NOT ADDRESSED.
- ( mouths words )

24:54.927 --> 24:57.797
BUT--

24:57.897 --> 24:59.999
LARRY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

25:00.099 --> 25:02.168
WHY DO YOU HAVE
TO COME HERE AND DO THAT?

25:02.268 --> 25:04.236
GIVE THE VIOLIN SIGN
IN FRONT OF ALL THESE PEOPLE?

25:04.336 --> 25:06.105
HE MADE
THE VIOLIN SIGN?!

25:06.205 --> 25:10.276
- HE WAS MAKING
THE VIOLIN SIGN!
- ( crowd grumbling )

25:10.376 --> 25:13.980
I GOT A KID A PRESENT.
IT WAS A PRESENT.

25:14.080 --> 25:16.616
THE VIOLIN SIGN, LARRY.
COME ON, PLEASE.

25:16.716 --> 25:19.285
WAIT A SECOND, MIKE.
LET ME HANDLE THIS.
I'M THE MAYOR.

25:19.385 --> 25:20.853
I'M NOT GONNA STAND HERE

25:20.953 --> 25:24.523
AND LISTEN TO ANYBODY
DENIGRATE MICHAEL J. FOX.

25:24.624 --> 25:26.759
HE'S A GREAT NEW YORKER
AND A GREAT AMERICAN.

25:26.859 --> 25:29.796
- Man: YEAH!
- I WASN'T DENIGRATING--
I DIDN'T DENIGRATE!

25:29.896 --> 25:31.363
LARRY, LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

25:31.463 --> 25:34.433
THIS GUY IS TRYING TO PUT
PARKINSON'S OUT OF BUSINESS

25:34.533 --> 25:37.136
AND I'M HERE TO PUT YOU
OUT OF THIS CITY.

25:37.236 --> 25:39.972
- GET OUT OF TOWN.
- WHAT?

25:40.072 --> 25:41.741
- I'M A NEW YORKER!
- GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

25:41.841 --> 25:45.211
- I'M-- I'M--
- GET OUT OF HERE!

25:45.311 --> 25:47.747
( crowd shouting )

25:50.249 --> 25:52.985
I'M A NEW YORKER.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT TO ME.

25:53.085 --> 25:54.821
I'M A NEW YORKER!

25:54.921 --> 25:56.756
- ( door closes )
- Man: I GOT YOUR RESULTS.

25:56.856 --> 25:58.925
- YOU'RE GONNA BE
JUST FINE.
- GREAT.

25:59.025 --> 26:01.493
NOW LISTEN,
THERE IS A SMALL AMOUNT
OF INTERNAL BLEEDING.

26:01.594 --> 26:02.795
- WHAT?
- IT'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.731
IT'S SMALL.
WE'RE GONNA HANDLE IT.

26:04.831 --> 26:07.033
- I WANNA GIVE YOU
SOME ANTIBIOTICS, OKAY?
- ANTIBIOTICS.

26:07.133 --> 26:09.568
AND CONSIDERING
THE AREA OF THE INJURY,

26:09.669 --> 26:12.071
I THINK THE BEST COURSE
IS TO DO SOME SUPPOSITORIES.

26:12.171 --> 26:16.676
- SUPPOSITORIES?
- THEY CALL THEM BULLETS.

26:23.515 --> 26:25.685
OH, HELLO.

26:27.687 --> 26:30.923
- LARRY.
- OH, HEY.

26:31.023 --> 26:32.925
YOU KNOW, I REALLY
OWE YOU AN APOLOGY.

26:33.025 --> 26:35.061
I WASN'T MOCKING YOU
WITH THE VIOLIN.

26:35.161 --> 26:37.563
I BOUGHT A VIOLIN
FOR THIS LITTLE KID.

26:37.664 --> 26:39.999
I COULDN'T SAY IT OUT LOUD
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
TO DISTURB YOU.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.001
SO I WAS TELLING JEFF
THAT I BOUGHT HIM A VIOLIN.

26:42.101 --> 26:44.771
IT'S OVER.
FORGET ABOUT IT.
IT'S JUST A CLEAN SLATE.

26:44.871 --> 26:46.405
- LET'S NOT DWELL ON IT.
- REALLY?

26:46.505 --> 26:49.108
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
I CAN DO FOR YOU,

26:49.208 --> 26:51.043
YOU JUST LET ME KNOW.

26:51.143 --> 26:53.412
IT'S FUNNY YOU SHOULD SAY THAT,
BECAUSE THERE ACTUALLY IS.

26:53.512 --> 26:56.048
TRACY AND I ARE
DOING THIS EVENT FOR
