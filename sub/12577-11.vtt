WEBVTT

00:09.600 --> 00:11.800
I'm getting
some nice color.

00:11.833 --> 00:13.467
( sighs )

00:13.500 --> 00:16.332
look out, mrs. Hill,
a snake!

00:18.300 --> 00:20.200
Oh, it's a harmless bull snake.

00:20.233 --> 00:25.467
I'd say he-- oh, pardon--
she is about nine months old.

00:28.833 --> 00:31.433
Your mom's as cool
as most people's dads.

00:31.667 --> 00:35.433
It's like that book they took
out of the school library:

00:35.467 --> 00:37.767
I've got two dads.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.500
Hank:
no, you don't.

01:13.067 --> 01:15.667
( ringing )

01:15.700 --> 01:17.433
this is hill.

01:17.467 --> 01:19.700
Tom landry middle school
needs you, peggy.

01:19.733 --> 01:22.033
This job's for at least a week,
maybe two.

01:22.067 --> 01:23.767
Can you sub for Mrs. Gonzalez?

01:23.800 --> 01:26.767
Gonzalez? Well,
that's spanish, isn't it?

01:26.800 --> 01:29.100
Yes, it is-- your best subject.

01:29.133 --> 01:30.800
You'll be fine. Just...

01:30.833 --> 01:32.200
Fine.

01:32.233 --> 01:34.367
There's something
you're not telling me.

01:34.400 --> 01:36.933
Dang it, peggy,
I could lose my job.

01:36.967 --> 01:38.033
Digame.

01:38.067 --> 01:39.333
I... I just can't

01:39.367 --> 01:41.833
but on a completely
unrelated subject

01:41.867 --> 01:43.633
hasn't it been a while

01:43.667 --> 01:46.367
since your last
surprise in-class evaluation?

01:46.400 --> 01:48.767
Well, yes, it has,
but tell me what you...

01:48.800 --> 01:50.967
ohh.

01:53.967 --> 01:55.933
Mrs. Hill, I'm ms. Ayres.

01:55.967 --> 01:57.233
I'm here to evaluate you.

01:57.267 --> 02:00.867
Really. Oh,
I had no idea.

02:00.900 --> 02:02.833
My goodness,
an evaluation.

02:02.867 --> 02:04.700
Well that... Imagine.

02:10.467 --> 02:12.333
A substitute.

02:12.367 --> 02:14.100
Attack.

02:14.133 --> 02:15.533
Hi, Mrs. Hill.

02:15.567 --> 02:17.300
Buenas dias, consuela.

02:17.333 --> 02:20.433
I have always enjoyed a special
relationship with my students.

02:20.467 --> 02:22.000
( forced chuckle )

02:22.033 --> 02:24.500
in fact, one of them
reminded me yesterday

02:24.533 --> 02:27.500
that I was honored as
substitute teacher of the year

02:27.533 --> 02:29.267
1996 through 1997 inclusive.

02:29.300 --> 02:32.267
That's impressive. So many subs
get bullied by their students.

02:32.300 --> 02:33.867
Well, a bully is just someone

02:33.900 --> 02:36.900
who victimizes others to make
themselves feel important.

02:36.933 --> 02:39.267
Would you like me
to repeat that slowly?

02:39.300 --> 02:42.600
Oh, no, I'm just penalizing you
for starting class late.

02:42.633 --> 02:44.233
You were saying?

02:44.267 --> 02:47.333
Hola. Me llamo senora

02:47.367 --> 02:48.867
( trilling tongue):
margarita hill.

02:48.900 --> 02:50.133
Como te llamas?

02:50.167 --> 02:52.000
Me llamo joseph gribble.

02:52.033 --> 02:55.133
Oh, bueno, jose gribble.

02:55.167 --> 02:56.900
( students laughing )

02:56.933 --> 02:58.267
y tu?

02:58.300 --> 02:59.400
Como te llamas?

02:59.433 --> 03:01.033
( sighs )

03:01.067 --> 03:03.833
me llamo clark peters.

03:03.867 --> 03:06.633
Muchos gustos, carlos pedros.

03:06.667 --> 03:07.967
( laughing )

03:08.000 --> 03:09.567
ay, margarita.

03:09.600 --> 03:13.267
( students laughing )

03:13.300 --> 03:16.167
vamos apprender los partes
del cuerpo humano.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.233
Por ejemplo.

03:18.267 --> 03:21.800
Este es mi mano.

03:23.500 --> 03:25.500
Si. Muy divertido.

03:25.533 --> 03:26.967
No mas, okay?

03:27.000 --> 03:29.900
Okay. Bueno, este es mi...

03:29.933 --> 03:32.167
Cabeza.

03:34.867 --> 03:36.300
( sighs )

03:36.333 --> 03:38.167
quien esta terando
los darts de nerf?

03:38.200 --> 03:40.567
Esta dooley, senora hill.

03:40.600 --> 03:42.900
Peggy:
senor dooley, venga.

03:42.933 --> 03:44.267
You're dead.

03:44.300 --> 03:46.633
En espanol, por favor.

03:46.667 --> 03:48.867
Tu eres muerto.

03:50.867 --> 03:52.400
Muy bien.

03:52.433 --> 03:55.300
Senor dooley esta mi
assistante especial.

03:56.700 --> 03:59.967
Bueno. Este
es mi cabeza.

04:01.733 --> 04:03.700
( students laughing )

04:03.733 --> 04:05.033
este es mi pelo.

04:05.067 --> 04:06.800
( laughter continues )

04:06.833 --> 04:08.500
mi pelo es
castano.

04:08.533 --> 04:09.967
Stop it!

04:10.000 --> 04:12.233
I know what
you are doing,
and just stop it.

04:12.267 --> 04:14.500
En espanol, por favor.

04:16.166 --> 04:18.132
Clase! Atencion!

04:18.166 --> 04:19.300
Atencion!

04:19.333 --> 04:20.300
Clase, please!

04:20.333 --> 04:21.933
( laughter continues )

04:21.966 --> 04:23.800
"needs improvement"?

04:23.833 --> 04:25.967
I have never
needed to improve

04:26.000 --> 04:27.633
on anything
in my whole life.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.867
This will be in my personnel
file forever.

04:29.900 --> 04:31.300
Relax, peggy.

04:31.333 --> 04:32.967
Everyone has a bad day.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.300
I remember back when I first
started at strickland propane

04:36.333 --> 04:39.467
there was this guy
who had a bad day.

04:39.500 --> 04:43.167
Uh, see? I can't even remember
that fella's name now.

04:53.367 --> 04:54.867
All right, everybody.

04:54.900 --> 04:56.233
Sit down.

04:56.267 --> 04:58.067
Andale.

05:03.200 --> 05:04.700
That's odd.

05:04.733 --> 05:07.033
I can't seem to get this
to work. It's...

05:07.067 --> 05:08.967
( laughter )

05:09.000 --> 05:12.367
okay. We don't have a lot time
for monkey business.

05:12.400 --> 05:13.833
So I think we'll skip

05:13.867 --> 05:15.433
attendance today
and finish up

05:15.467 --> 05:16.900
our vocabular lesson.

05:16.933 --> 05:18.000
( laughter )

05:19.867 --> 05:21.433
I have had it with you two.

05:21.467 --> 05:24.867
I am a very fun teacher,
but I will not be bullied.

05:24.900 --> 05:27.033
Give me your watches.
come on. Give them to me.

05:27.067 --> 05:29.433
I am not joking, you two.

05:32.900 --> 05:33.933
( gasps )

05:35.633 --> 05:38.667
I pulled
your pants down.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.900
Oh, yeah!

06:04.800 --> 06:06.000
( gasps )

06:06.033 --> 06:07.800
holy crap.

06:12.367 --> 06:15.167
18 years, 18 years of teaching
thrown out the window

06:15.200 --> 06:16.633
with one flick
of the wrist.

06:16.667 --> 06:18.900
Don't panic, peggy.
there's lots you can do.

06:18.933 --> 06:20.433
I could design software.

06:20.467 --> 06:22.167
People have
always said that.

06:22.200 --> 06:23.567
I could open up

06:23.600 --> 06:25.000
a paint-your-own-pottery store.

06:25.033 --> 06:27.000
You know how much
they get for that crap?

06:27.033 --> 06:28.933
Slow down, peggy.
they won't fire you.

06:28.967 --> 06:31.833
You're a substitute teacher.
they'll just stop calling.

06:31.867 --> 06:34.433
But that's not going
to happen, either.
( gasps )

06:34.467 --> 06:35.933
maybe it should.

06:35.967 --> 06:37.600
I hit an innocent child.

06:37.633 --> 06:39.033
I'm sure you
didn't hurt him.

06:39.067 --> 06:40.267
I should know.

06:40.300 --> 06:42.167
I got spanked
plenty in school.

06:42.200 --> 06:45.100
Really? Well,
you turned out just fine.

06:45.133 --> 06:46.933
Better than fine,
and back then

06:46.967 --> 06:49.333
they even used a paddle
called "old spanky."

06:49.367 --> 06:52.467
It was a piece of
hickory about yea big

06:52.500 --> 06:54.833
and it had holes
drilled in it

06:54.867 --> 06:57.833
to cut down on wind resistance

06:57.867 --> 07:01.000
and a... Little pine tar
on the handle

07:01.033 --> 07:03.067
for a no-slip grip.

07:03.100 --> 07:04.700
ugh.

07:04.733 --> 07:06.033
Good old spanky.

07:06.067 --> 07:07.967
( weak chuckle )

07:08.000 --> 07:10.100
mom, what were
you thinking?

07:10.133 --> 07:12.133
Bobby, honey,
I am so sorry.

07:12.167 --> 07:14.867
I'm so... I just
did not know what to do.

07:14.900 --> 07:16.767
Dooley pants'd you.

07:16.800 --> 07:19.300
That's what he does,
and, when it happens

07:19.333 --> 07:21.767
you pull up your
pants and move on.

07:21.800 --> 07:25.200
If you don't know that,
no wonder you bombed

07:25.233 --> 07:26.733
on your evaluation.

07:26.767 --> 07:28.633
I never even spank our dog

07:28.667 --> 07:30.400
not that your son
is worse than our dog

07:30.433 --> 07:32.767
because he's not,
and we have a very,
very good dog

07:32.800 --> 07:34.567
so that speaks
volumes for your son.

07:34.600 --> 07:37.000
Mrs. Hill, please,
we should apologize to you.

07:37.033 --> 07:38.333
I'm sure stuart deserved it.

07:38.367 --> 07:40.000
We know what a handful
he can be.

07:40.033 --> 07:41.933
Well, what are you saying?

07:41.967 --> 07:43.900
You did good.

07:43.933 --> 07:45.500
Hmm. Let's see.

07:45.533 --> 07:47.133
Teacher's statement...

07:47.167 --> 07:48.767
Response from the parents...

07:48.800 --> 07:51.633
Okay. Looks like
all our ducks are in a row.

07:51.667 --> 07:53.067
Peggy, you're fired.

07:53.100 --> 07:55.600
But... But the dooleys
forgave me.

07:55.633 --> 07:57.100
Hmm. Let's see.

07:57.133 --> 07:58.767
Uh, there's nothing
here about forgiveness.

07:58.800 --> 08:00.400
There are procedures

08:00.433 --> 08:02.233
for administering
legal spankings

08:02.267 --> 08:04.000
which you violated
at every turn

08:04.033 --> 08:06.600
and there are procedures
for terminating a teacher

08:06.633 --> 08:08.333
which I followed
to a "t." emily?

08:11.433 --> 08:12.900
I'm required to have

08:12.933 --> 08:15.033
a hall monitor
escort you off campus.

08:15.067 --> 08:16.600
It's over, Mrs. Hill.

08:18.167 --> 08:20.100
( peggy sobbing )

08:22.867 --> 08:25.733
i'm sorry, ladies.
looks like there's not going

08:25.767 --> 08:27.200
to be a three-peat.

08:27.233 --> 08:28.200
Oh, hank

08:28.233 --> 08:30.033
what am I going to do?

08:30.067 --> 08:33.000
Well, uh, I got you a book
on designing software.

08:33.033 --> 08:35.533
( sobbing )

08:42.433 --> 08:44.000
( sighs )

08:44.033 --> 08:46.233
well, you had it all,
peggy hill.

08:49.767 --> 08:51.167
Hey, there, hank's wife.

08:51.200 --> 08:53.033
What you crying for?

08:53.067 --> 08:54.667
Got your monthlies?

08:54.700 --> 08:56.267
Cotton, I am in no mood.

08:56.300 --> 08:57.567
Why are you here?

08:57.600 --> 08:59.600
V.f.w. Meeting
and pancake supper.

08:59.633 --> 09:02.233
So I need you to whip
me up some pancakes--

09:02.267 --> 09:03.933
A couple of
hundred will do--

09:03.967 --> 09:05.633
And as much syrup
as you got.

09:05.667 --> 09:07.067
Fine.

09:07.100 --> 09:10.900
I will go make you
200 pancakes.

09:10.933 --> 09:12.800
( sobbing )

09:12.833 --> 09:14.567
ah.

09:14.600 --> 09:16.233
( sobbing continues )

09:16.267 --> 09:17.900
( groans )

09:17.933 --> 09:19.300
how's bobby?

09:19.333 --> 09:20.900
He's just fine

09:20.933 --> 09:24.133
but my information about bobby
is a little dated.

09:24.167 --> 09:26.800
He hasn't spoken to me
since I got fired

09:26.833 --> 09:29.600
for spanking a student.

09:31.067 --> 09:32.567
What'd you do, kill him?

09:32.600 --> 09:35.067
no.
Ain't no law
against spanking.

09:35.100 --> 09:36.333
Tell you what.

09:36.367 --> 09:38.400
I got a friend
over to the v.f.w.

09:38.433 --> 09:40.467
Used to principal
at hank's school.

09:40.500 --> 09:42.400
He'll have you back
spanking in no time.

09:42.433 --> 09:44.300
Oh, well, I just want
my job back.

09:44.333 --> 09:45.967
I'm not going
to spank again.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.233
Shut up before you
talk me out of it.

09:51.933 --> 09:55.800
In my 35 years at
tom landry middle school

09:55.833 --> 09:58.433
I spanked thousands
of students

09:58.467 --> 10:01.233
shaping their character
and preparing them

10:01.267 --> 10:03.300
to die in wars overseas.

10:03.333 --> 10:05.900
Actually, I only spanked once.

10:05.933 --> 10:07.433
Hell, she's just being modest.

10:07.467 --> 10:09.567
She's the first teacher
since they killed l.b.j.

10:09.600 --> 10:11.300
To stand up
to those draft dodgers.

10:11.333 --> 10:13.467
All right, peggy,
we're going to get you

10:13.500 --> 10:14.767
back in that classroom.

10:14.800 --> 10:16.433
Damn straight.
yeah.

10:16.467 --> 10:19.200
Step one: you got to
meet the school board.

10:20.900 --> 10:22.200
Old spanky.

10:22.233 --> 10:24.633
( men laughing )

10:24.667 --> 10:26.067
go on. Take it.

10:26.100 --> 10:28.467
It's yours.
I got nobody to hit anymore.

10:28.500 --> 10:31.200
Thanks for this
terrific... Symbol

10:31.233 --> 10:33.400
and for helping me
get my job back.

10:33.433 --> 10:37.233
All right, guys,
let's hear it for
paddlin' peggy!

10:37.267 --> 10:40.133
( cheering )

10:40.167 --> 10:41.733
man:
take off your top!

10:41.767 --> 10:43.267
Man 2:
shut up, wendell!

10:43.300 --> 10:44.533
That's tomorrow night.

10:46.500 --> 10:47.900
Hi, guys.

10:49.267 --> 10:52.267
Hank, I just had the
most inspiring afternoon

10:52.300 --> 10:53.767
with cotton and
his army buddies.

10:53.800 --> 10:55.433
They're going to
circulate a petition

10:55.467 --> 10:57.233
to help me get
my job back.

10:57.267 --> 10:59.933
I even have the support of your
old principal jeter turbeville.

10:59.967 --> 11:01.633
Jeter the beater?

11:01.667 --> 11:04.000
Oh, god, what's that
under your arm?

11:04.033 --> 11:07.467
Old spanky. Can you believe they
ever used something like this?

11:09.033 --> 11:10.633
( chuckling )

11:12.200 --> 11:13.833
spanking was
wrong then

11:13.867 --> 11:15.467
and it's wrong now.

11:15.500 --> 11:18.700
I say spare the rod
and spo the child.

11:18.733 --> 11:21.633
Dale, spare the rod
and spoil the child means

11:21.667 --> 11:24.100
you're in favor
of spanking.

11:25.667 --> 11:27.033
I don't think so.

11:27.067 --> 11:28.367
Man, I tell
you what.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.100
Bring back
those bad memories.

11:30.133 --> 11:32.867
Talking 'bout ol' jeter
the beater. Whack.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.633
Man, ol' time,
them pillows, man.

11:34.667 --> 11:36.167
Well, I don't know.

11:36.200 --> 11:38.500
My daddy spanked
me every day

11:38.533 --> 11:41.167
from when I was
nine till I was 16

11:41.200 --> 11:43.500
and I turned out okay.

11:43.533 --> 11:44.667
Bastard.

11:49.400 --> 11:50.500
Peggy.

11:50.533 --> 11:51.667
Uh...

11:51.700 --> 11:53.333
We sure do Miss
you at landry.

11:53.367 --> 11:54.367
Thanks.

11:54.400 --> 11:55.667
I'm not a spanker, okay?

11:55.700 --> 11:57.667
But if you can
bring discipline

11:57.700 --> 11:59.000
back into our school

11:59.033 --> 12:00.733
then I am behind
you 100%.

12:00.767 --> 12:03.067
I wish I had the guts
you do, sister.

12:03.100 --> 12:04.467
I'm no hero.

12:04.500 --> 12:06.367
Stuart dooley just caught me
on a bad day.

12:06.400 --> 12:07.767
Don't be modest.

12:07.800 --> 12:10.000
You are an inspiration
to all of us teachers

12:10.033 --> 12:12.233
and that's why we
signed that petition

12:12.267 --> 12:13.833
in support of
paddlin' peggy.

12:13.867 --> 12:18.067
Oh, well, that's just
those vets being silly.

12:18.100 --> 12:19.900
Here. Have a button.

12:23.267 --> 12:24.567
The school board vote

12:24.600 --> 12:27.367
on reinstating
mrs. Peggy hill passes.

12:27.400 --> 12:28.933
( cheering )

12:28.967 --> 12:31.667
all right,
paddlin' peggy.
walk tall, sister.

12:31.700 --> 12:33.133
We did it,
hank's wife.

12:33.167 --> 12:34.333
Party at my house.

12:34.367 --> 12:36.233
Pancakes for everyone.

12:36.267 --> 12:37.233
( cheering )

12:37.267 --> 12:39.067
man:
take off
your top!

12:41.500 --> 12:43.400
Well, I'm off to work,
mrs. Hill.

12:43.433 --> 12:45.000
Me, too, Mr. Hill.

12:45.033 --> 12:46.133
Uh, Mrs. Hill

12:46.167 --> 12:48.933
why are you
bringing the paddle?

12:48.967 --> 12:50.100
Oh, I have to.

12:50.133 --> 12:51.433
People are
expecting it.

12:51.467 --> 12:53.533
Besides, your father
worked very hard

12:53.567 --> 12:56.000
to put paddlin' peggy
back in the classroom.

12:56.033 --> 12:57.567
See, that's the thing...

12:57.600 --> 12:59.733
My dad thinks you're
going to use it.

12:59.767 --> 13:01.733
Oh, hank,
don't be silly, honey.

13:01.767 --> 13:03.167
It's just a bluff.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.467
I am going to scare
my students exactly the way

13:05.500 --> 13:08.467
president reagan scared
hundreds of millions of russians

13:08.500 --> 13:10.033
with his star wars death beam.

13:11.300 --> 13:13.500
I Miss voting for that man.

13:16.167 --> 13:19.600
Listen, I just want to apologize
for what happened the other day.

13:19.633 --> 13:22.600
I will never ever spank another
student like that again...

13:22.633 --> 13:24.667
Because now I have this.

13:24.700 --> 13:26.233
( all gasping )

13:26.267 --> 13:29.433
but, of course, it will not
be necessary to use this

13:29.467 --> 13:32.467
because, well, now you all know
I have it in me.

13:32.500 --> 13:33.800
( chuckles )

13:33.833 --> 13:36.100
so, why don't we just
start all over.

13:36.133 --> 13:38.600
Yo soy...

13:38.633 --> 13:41.633
Paddlin' peggy hill.

13:43.667 --> 13:45.600
Mm-hmm.

13:49.700 --> 13:51.400
El capital de uruguay

13:51.433 --> 13:52.933
es montevideo.

13:52.967 --> 13:54.933
Do you think
she's going to
use that paddle?

13:54.967 --> 13:56.100
I don't know

13:56.133 --> 13:57.300
but I'll
tell you what...

13:57.333 --> 13:58.567
Excuse me.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.533
Should you be talking
while I am talking?

14:00.567 --> 14:03.167
Paddlin' peggy says, uh...

14:03.200 --> 14:05.367
Oh, paddlin' peggy says

14:05.400 --> 14:06.633
uh-uh-uh.

14:10.433 --> 14:12.833
You got to
do something
about mom.

14:12.867 --> 14:15.833
This whole paddlin' peggy shtick
is really creepy.

14:15.867 --> 14:18.333
Joseph won't even come over
to play anymore

14:18.367 --> 14:20.533
'cause he says
he's having nightmares

14:20.567 --> 14:22.000
about that stupid paddle.

14:22.033 --> 14:23.200
Did you hear that?

14:23.233 --> 14:24.400
My son is dreaming

14:24.433 --> 14:26.500
about getting spanked
by your wife.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.167
Well, that's not
so unusual.

14:28.200 --> 14:31.067
You got to get
your woman in line.

14:31.100 --> 14:34.867
Uh, peggy's kind of
hard to talk to lately.

14:34.900 --> 14:37.200
Well, she's feeling
powerful now

14:37.233 --> 14:38.867
so her body
is producing

14:38.900 --> 14:41.033
extra amounts
of testosterone.

14:41.067 --> 14:44.267
I bet if peggy wanted to,
she could grow a mustache.

14:45.867 --> 14:47.500
'course, I don't know
why she'd want to.

14:57.400 --> 14:58.833
Guess who won

14:58.867 --> 15:02.233
best french manicure
at the beauty academy today?

15:06.667 --> 15:10.267
Dad, can I
go ride bikes
with joseph?

15:10.300 --> 15:12.200
I thought
we'd watch shark week

15:12.233 --> 15:13.633
on the discovery channel.

15:13.667 --> 15:15.100
Michael palin is hosting.

15:15.133 --> 15:16.600
I don't want to.

15:16.633 --> 15:18.767
But, honey, you love
michael palin.

15:18.800 --> 15:20.900
Are you coming down
with something?

15:20.933 --> 15:22.400
Let me feel
your forehead.

15:22.433 --> 15:25.200
I don't want to watch
your stupid show, okay?

15:25.233 --> 15:26.667
Bobby!

15:26.700 --> 15:28.700
Well, what is wrong with him?

15:28.733 --> 15:30.767
Probably nothing...

15:30.800 --> 15:32.767
Or, uh...

15:32.800 --> 15:35.133
Uh, it could be you...

15:35.167 --> 15:37.767
And, uh...
your whupping stick.

15:37.800 --> 15:39.933
It's a paddle,
and he has a name--

15:39.967 --> 15:41.733
"old spanky."

15:41.767 --> 15:44.200
Hank, do I tell you
how to sell propane

15:44.233 --> 15:45.700
and propane accessories?

15:45.733 --> 15:46.967
Did I criticize you

15:47.000 --> 15:49.400
for your big
"spatula tuesday" fiasco?

15:49.433 --> 15:50.733
No, I did not

15:50.767 --> 15:53.367
because I respect you
as a professional

15:53.400 --> 15:56.033
and that is all I want, hank,
just a little respect

15:56.067 --> 15:58.067
but I guess that's too much
to ask for

15:58.100 --> 15:59.300
from you and bobby.

15:59.333 --> 16:02.500
All right.
it was sharona johnson.

16:02.533 --> 16:03.833
It's not fair.

16:03.867 --> 16:05.900
She works really hard.

16:11.167 --> 16:12.533
Hank, channel 84

16:12.567 --> 16:14.833
wants to do something
on paddlin' peggy.

16:14.867 --> 16:16.133
Where is old spanky?

16:16.167 --> 16:17.767
Maybe you left it at work.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.133
No, no.

16:19.167 --> 16:20.933
I know I had it with me
on the drive home.

16:20.967 --> 16:22.200
I remember brandishing it

16:22.233 --> 16:24.000
at this idiot
who almost cut me off.

16:28.833 --> 16:31.367
Oh, I've got to retrace
my steps home.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.633
Okay. I'm driving home...

16:33.667 --> 16:35.467
Brandish, brandish, brandish...

16:35.500 --> 16:37.500
Oh, god! I must have dropped it
on the street!

16:40.400 --> 16:41.800
Stop, peggy!

16:41.833 --> 16:43.700
Would you look
at yourself?

16:43.733 --> 16:44.833
( sighs )

16:44.867 --> 16:46.100
spanky!

16:54.200 --> 16:56.500
Joseph gribble,
did you put this here?

16:56.533 --> 16:57.600
no.

17:00.367 --> 17:04.099
Uh, joseph, you are talking
to paddlin' peggy here.

17:04.133 --> 17:05.567
All right. What's going on?

17:05.599 --> 17:06.933
( screams )

17:06.967 --> 17:09.000
your son stole
my paddlin' peggy paddle.

17:09.032 --> 17:11.400
This is the only thing
that stands between

17:11.433 --> 17:13.900
the arlen school system
and complete chaos.

17:13.933 --> 17:15.099
Apologize, you!

17:15.133 --> 17:16.833
I didn't do anything.

17:16.867 --> 17:19.400
All right. I am not
all talk, you know?

17:19.433 --> 17:22.267
You didn't apologize,
so you chose your fate.

17:22.300 --> 17:23.500
Somebody stop her!

17:23.532 --> 17:24.567
Peggy, no!

17:24.599 --> 17:26.433
I said I didn't do anything.

17:26.467 --> 17:28.400
He's telling
the truth, mom.

17:28.433 --> 17:30.000
He was with me
all day.

17:30.033 --> 17:31.733
Well, somebody took it.

17:31.767 --> 17:32.867
It was bill.

17:32.900 --> 17:34.433
No, it wasn't.

17:34.467 --> 17:36.600
All right. It was me.
I took it.

17:36.633 --> 17:38.267
Somebody had
to stop you.

17:38.300 --> 17:39.867
You're crazy.

17:46.600 --> 17:47.800
Oh, my!

17:53.033 --> 17:54.733
It's okay, son.

17:54.767 --> 17:56.400
Daddy's here.

17:57.733 --> 17:59.633
You big bully.

18:09.467 --> 18:11.667
Oh, hank, what
was I thinking?

18:11.700 --> 18:13.333
The important
thing is

18:13.367 --> 18:16.000
your spanking days
are over, right?

18:16.033 --> 18:17.633
Well, so are my teaching days.

18:17.667 --> 18:19.800
At least, until the day
they makes pants

18:19.833 --> 18:23.000
that cannot be pulled down by
someone other than the wearer.

18:23.033 --> 18:24.867
Sounds to me
like you're scared.

18:24.900 --> 18:27.733
You know, I have
a little speech
I've been saving

18:27.767 --> 18:30.133
for the day bobby
gets beat up by a bully

18:30.167 --> 18:32.833
but I don't think
that's ever going to happen.

18:32.867 --> 18:34.500
Him and his darn
prop comedy.

18:34.533 --> 18:35.967
Every time
the boy

18:36.000 --> 18:39.767
gets into a jam, he shoves
french fries up his nose

18:39.800 --> 18:41.467
and makes a new friend.

18:41.500 --> 18:44.600
Anyway, I think my speech
might apply here.

18:44.633 --> 18:46.100
Do you want
to hear it?

18:46.133 --> 18:47.633
Oh, hank, no.

18:47.667 --> 18:49.300
You know, somewhere inside me

18:49.333 --> 18:52.433
is the old peggy hill--
the one who taught children

18:52.467 --> 18:54.933
without scaring
the bejeezus out of them.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.767
I just need to find her again.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.233
And then she freaked out

19:01.267 --> 19:03.000
and she dropped the paddle

19:03.033 --> 19:05.133
right in the middle
of the alley.

19:05.167 --> 19:06.367
Without that paddle

19:06.400 --> 19:08.533
she looked just like
bobby's mom.

19:08.567 --> 19:09.867
( bell ringing )

19:09.900 --> 19:11.267
that's the bell.

19:21.233 --> 19:23.167
Buenos dias, clase.

19:23.200 --> 19:26.933
Senor dooley, I thought
you were suspended?

19:26.967 --> 19:29.133
I thought you
were fired.

19:29.167 --> 19:30.567
( class laughing )

19:30.600 --> 19:34.200
oh, bygones are bygones,
so, welcome back.

19:35.233 --> 19:37.133
Well, I thought we might talk

19:37.167 --> 19:39.400
about a special part
of spanish history...

19:39.433 --> 19:40.467
( class laughing )

19:41.900 --> 19:43.667
your feet are big.

19:43.700 --> 19:46.867
( laughing continues )

19:46.900 --> 19:49.800
paddlin' peggy,
who don't you spank them?

19:49.833 --> 19:53.100
Yeah, paddlin' peggy.

19:57.500 --> 20:01.467
Fine. All you children
are interested in is punishment

20:01.500 --> 20:04.167
so I will teach you
about punishment.

20:04.200 --> 20:05.467
With this!

20:05.500 --> 20:07.033
( all gasping )

20:09.833 --> 20:11.467
yes! Yes!

20:15.900 --> 20:17.367
Oh, yeah!

20:17.400 --> 20:18.633
( gasping )

20:18.667 --> 20:20.000
spain, 1478.

20:20.033 --> 20:23.533
The weapon of choice-- the mace.

20:23.567 --> 20:26.367
It was the beginning
of the spanish inquisition.

20:26.400 --> 20:29.467
Even though it was begun
with the best of intentions

20:29.500 --> 20:31.600
a number of very nice,
innocent people

20:31.633 --> 20:32.967
were brutally punished

20:33.000 --> 20:34.467
and without
a doubt

20:34.500 --> 20:36.367
the worst thing about
the spanish inquisition

20:36.400 --> 20:39.600
was that nobody ever said
they were sorry.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.467
How were they punished?

20:43.500 --> 20:45.967
Oh, all kinds of awful ways.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.133
Like what?

20:48.167 --> 20:51.467
Well, sometimes they would
strike you with one of these.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.500
Sometimes they would make you
lie on a bed of spikes

20:54.533 --> 20:56.400
and then pour
boiling oil
on you.

20:56.433 --> 20:57.967
ooh!

20:58.000 --> 21:01.600
Mm-hmm, and sometimes, they
would tie your arms and legs

21:01.633 --> 21:04.200
to four different horses
and tear you apart.

21:04.233 --> 21:05.433
( class gasping )

21:05.467 --> 21:07.367
cool.

21:14.033 --> 21:16.433
Why, I feel like
i'm being watched.

21:16.467 --> 21:17.800
Joseph?

21:17.833 --> 21:19.100
Jo-seph?

21:19.133 --> 21:21.300
What?

21:22.600 --> 21:24.233
Dale:
careful, joseph.

21:24.267 --> 21:26.100
I'm just here to
play with bobby.

21:26.133 --> 21:27.433
I don't want
any trouble.

21:27.467 --> 21:28.767
I could use
a little help

21:28.800 --> 21:29.967
preparing the soil.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.533
Why don't you
spread the mulch?

21:31.567 --> 21:33.900
What's it made out of?

21:33.933 --> 21:35.333
Paddle.

21:37.467 --> 21:40.533
And goat manure.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.600
Tu eres muerto.

22:21.305 --> 22:27.466
