Woman: Oh, sid...

02:55.634 --> 02:58.470
Oh!

03:02.224 --> 03:04.726
Oh, sid!

04:02.367 --> 04:04.369
I don't feel like
going to work this morning.

04:04.453 --> 04:05.662
Can't you take the day off?

04:08.039 --> 04:10.876
No. I get bored sittin' around all day
doin' nothing.

04:11.042 --> 04:14.129
You wouldn't get bored
with me around, Sidney.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.883
I'll put the kettle on.

04:50.749 --> 04:52.250
Some plumber.

05:26.117 --> 05:28.203
Woman: You know
a lot of people, don't you?

05:28.286 --> 05:29.079
Eh?

05:29.204 --> 05:31.122
All those people writing to you.

05:31.206 --> 05:33.333
They're bills, darling, bills.

05:33.416 --> 05:34.918
Oh, bills.

05:35.085 --> 05:37.838
"And, after repeated applications
havin' been ignored,

05:37.921 --> 05:40.048
"we shall be forced to
reclaim the property

05:40.131 --> 05:42.259
"within the next ten days."

05:42.342 --> 05:44.052
Ah, well.

05:44.135 --> 05:45.595
There goes the record player.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.557
Oh, I didn't know you had a player.
Let's put a record on.

05:48.682 --> 05:49.891
Look, I told you, I'm late.

05:49.975 --> 05:51.852
Look, for Christ's sake,
make yourself useful.

05:51.977 --> 05:53.436
The kettle's boiling.

05:53.520 --> 05:56.523
Oh, sid, it's lovely
and warm in here.

05:57.232 --> 05:59.526
I'll tell you what,
I'll have a little nap.

05:59.651 --> 06:02.696
When you've gone to work,
I'll get up and make you my speciality.

06:02.779 --> 06:05.198
I've already had your speciality.

06:05.282 --> 06:06.908
Get your arse out of that bed.

06:07.075 --> 06:08.952
Don't mince your words, do ya?

06:35.020 --> 06:36.771
You made that tea yet?

06:36.855 --> 06:38.523
I'm already drinking mine.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.359
Oh, you're not back in bed again!

06:41.484 --> 06:43.421
Well, you were ieapin'
up and down on me all night.

06:43.445 --> 06:44.988
I'm utterly exhausted.

06:45.155 --> 06:47.198
Well, I didn't hear you complainin'.

06:48.450 --> 06:49.910
Come on, girl.

06:49.993 --> 06:51.703
I'll give you a lift.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.190
I wanna get out of here before...

06:55.498 --> 06:59.127
Bloody hell, here he is. Adolf.
Come on, come on.

07:05.467 --> 07:07.677
It's Monday.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.971
I forgot all about the rent.
I'm terribly sorry.

07:10.055 --> 07:11.348
I haven't got it, I'm afraid.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.600
You can't go on being
"terribly sorry", mr south.

07:13.725 --> 07:15.477
It's five weeks now.

07:15.560 --> 07:16.829
I'm afraid this matter
will shortly be

07:16.853 --> 07:19.773
in the implacable hands
of our computer.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.650
Not the computer!

07:21.816 --> 07:24.861
- What will it do to me?
- Send you an eviction notice.

07:25.070 --> 07:27.030
Now, er...
You wouldn't like that, would you?

07:27.155 --> 07:28.698
No, I wouldn't like that, would I?

07:28.823 --> 07:30.718
Well, you'd better get
your finger out, hadn't you?

07:30.742 --> 07:32.243
Good day.

07:33.703 --> 07:35.497
Here, Adolf!

07:35.538 --> 07:37.499
You forgot your machine gun.

07:41.670 --> 07:44.589
Male neighbour:
Oh, mr south, here's your gas bill.

07:45.090 --> 07:46.675
Oh, and while I'm about it,

07:46.758 --> 07:49.219
do you mind making
a little less noise of a morning?

07:49.260 --> 07:52.681
It's not that I'm narrow-minded,
but enough's enough.

07:57.686 --> 07:59.646
Ain't you ready yet?
What you hangin' about for?

07:59.771 --> 08:02.899
- Well, have you seen what's happened to my...
- Come on!

08:04.943 --> 08:07.028
I've seen some
dizzy birds in my time,

08:07.112 --> 08:09.572
but you take the bleedin' biscuit.

10:02.393 --> 10:04.771
All right, I'll see you
later, then, darling. Ta-da.

10:04.854 --> 10:07.816
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What it says.

10:07.899 --> 10:11.111
So that's all it meant?
Well, thank you very much.

10:11.236 --> 10:13.547
Look, I've got your phone number.
I'll call you, all right?

10:13.571 --> 10:14.739
Yeah. I'll bet.

10:14.906 --> 10:16.032
Once you get what you want,

10:16.116 --> 10:18.660
you can't wait to
pull the next one, can ya?

10:18.827 --> 10:21.454
What's that got to do with love,
that's what I'd like to know.

10:21.579 --> 10:23.623
Hark at her!
Who said anythin' about love?

10:23.748 --> 10:25.708
You did! Last night.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.710
You don't even remember, do you?

10:27.836 --> 10:31.047
- It so happens I've got feelings.
- Look, I'll tell you what I'll do.

10:31.172 --> 10:32.775
When I get home tonight,
I'll call you, all right?

10:32.799 --> 10:35.301
Don't bother.
I never want to see you or it again.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.594
Ssh!

10:36.719 --> 10:38.012
Don't you shush me!

10:38.096 --> 10:40.431
I want the whole world
to know what you're like.

10:40.557 --> 10:43.518
Look, everybody,
the original mr big.

10:43.643 --> 10:47.480
Except where it counts,
you male chauvinist pig.

10:47.605 --> 10:48.857
Knickers.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.511
Hello.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.555
Ba crapper limited.

11:20.638 --> 11:22.891
Plumbing and sanitary installations.

11:23.850 --> 11:24.934
Yes.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.896
I'm sorry, madam.
No. I can't help you, no.

11:27.979 --> 11:30.273
No, I'm afraid all my men
are out on jobs.

11:31.983 --> 11:33.902
Yes. Well, I'll take
the address down, yes.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.154
Yes. Thank you. Yeah.

11:36.321 --> 11:39.782
Yes, it is humanly possible.
Yes, yes, yes.

11:40.491 --> 11:42.076
All right, thank you. Bye-bye.

11:43.828 --> 11:45.413
Morning, crappie!

11:48.416 --> 11:50.793
What do you want to do that for?
That was red hot.

11:50.960 --> 11:54.297
Cor blimey,
what time do you call this?

11:54.380 --> 11:56.216
You should have been here
at eight o'clock.

11:56.299 --> 11:57.967
Why? What happened?

11:58.134 --> 11:59.886
How do you expect me
to run my business

11:59.969 --> 12:01.721
with lazy hounds like you
on the books, eh?

12:01.846 --> 12:03.726
Come on, crappie.
I'm up to my eyeballs in debt.

12:03.765 --> 12:05.475
Sort us out
some decent jobs, will ya?

12:05.600 --> 12:08.280
As a matter of fact, I was thinking of
crossing you off my register.

12:08.394 --> 12:11.147
Leave it out.
You wouldn't survive without me.

12:11.314 --> 12:13.107
Well, you're lucky,
as it so happens.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.318
- Something's just come in.
- Yeah?

12:15.485 --> 12:18.571
Yeah, a bit of plumbing
and a lavatory seat to fix.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.033
- And, sid...
- Yeah?

12:22.951 --> 12:26.412
- Try and do a good job, eh? Eh?
- Crappie.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.083
What is it?

12:31.042 --> 12:32.460
I love you.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.589
Don't be so blooming familiar.

13:46.701 --> 13:48.286
Oh! I'm very sorry.

13:48.411 --> 13:51.539
It happens all the while.
Come in, mr plumber.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.762
You don't mind me
watching, do you?

14:08.639 --> 14:10.892
No, I don't mind you watching.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.355
- You live here all alone?
- At the moment.

14:15.730 --> 14:17.815
Bill's away. That's my husband.

14:20.151 --> 14:22.653
He's been away almost a year now.

14:23.237 --> 14:25.114
I've almost forgotten
what he looks like.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.991
Are you married?

14:28.576 --> 14:31.746
- No. It's not my scene.
- You'd make a lovely husband.

14:31.913 --> 14:33.331
What makes you say that?

14:33.414 --> 14:36.167
Women get a feeling
about these things.

14:37.126 --> 14:40.046
- Oh, yeah?
- I must make the bed.

14:42.173 --> 14:44.592
Give me a call when you've finished.

14:48.137 --> 14:52.100
J“ it's your birthday, dear sid
it's your birthday, dear sid

14:52.266 --> 14:54.977
j“ it's your birthday, dear Sidney j“

15:19.710 --> 15:22.046
- I've finished!
- Oh, good!

15:23.047 --> 15:24.715
Do you mind if I
take the old seat away?

15:24.799 --> 15:26.592
Might come in useful.

15:26.717 --> 15:29.137
Do what you like with it!

15:29.178 --> 15:31.055
Come and get your money.

15:31.139 --> 15:33.266
Door opposite the bathroom.

15:43.359 --> 15:44.652
Come in.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.907
Er... that'll be twenty pounds.

15:50.491 --> 15:52.660
My chequebook's
on the dressing table.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.912
Would you bring it over here?

16:01.836 --> 16:03.045
Sit down.

16:17.435 --> 16:18.686
Here, what're you doin'?!

16:18.769 --> 16:20.605
You have me at your mercy.

16:20.688 --> 16:23.357
I'm in your power. I'm helpless.

16:23.524 --> 16:27.570
- Rubbish.
- They bind me to you. I'm yours.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.238
Do with me what you will.

16:29.363 --> 16:31.723
Yeah, well, you might have
waited till I'd got me shirt off.

16:31.782 --> 16:35.244
Oh. Oh!
What a lovely hairy chest.

16:35.328 --> 16:38.039
Oh, you're so powerful,
so overwhelming.

16:38.122 --> 16:40.416
Here, what about your husband?

16:40.791 --> 16:44.045
- Bill! Where are you?
- Yeah. Where is he?

16:44.128 --> 16:46.589
In prison.
He won't be out till tomorrow.

16:46.756 --> 16:49.800
We've got one whole day
to be really naughty.

17:09.403 --> 17:11.906
- Bill: Oi!
- Hello, bill!

17:32.218 --> 17:33.469
You wanna go straight home?

17:34.679 --> 17:36.889
No, she's not expecting me
till tomorrow.

17:36.973 --> 17:38.266
She don't like surprises.

17:38.599 --> 17:41.269
By the way, er...
Where exactly did you hide 'em?

17:41.394 --> 17:44.605
Oh cor blimey,
I've only been out five minutes.

17:44.772 --> 17:47.942
Here, pull up at that phone box.
I'm gonna ring her.

17:48.109 --> 17:50.861
Can't wait to get my teeth
in one of her chicken fricassées.

17:51.028 --> 17:52.321
Chicken fricassées!

17:52.446 --> 17:54.865
Two hundred grand's worth
of gold bars hanging about,

17:54.991 --> 17:58.703
all you can think about
is chicken fricassées. Cor blimey!

18:00.496 --> 18:03.583
You are my master,
I am your slave.

18:03.749 --> 18:06.043
Be rough with me.

18:06.127 --> 18:08.254
Quick, quickly.

18:10.047 --> 18:11.507
Just a minute.

18:11.799 --> 18:13.092
What?

18:34.155 --> 18:35.531
Hello?

18:35.781 --> 18:37.116
Janice?

18:37.283 --> 18:38.826
Hello, my love.

18:40.077 --> 18:41.996
Why, it's me, Billy.

18:42.079 --> 18:43.289
Yeah.

18:43.372 --> 18:44.874
I'm on me way home.

18:44.999 --> 18:46.459
Yeah, now.

18:46.542 --> 18:49.378
Keep the bed warm, darlin', eh?

18:54.508 --> 18:55.718
- Bloody hell!
- What?

18:55.885 --> 18:58.638
I must have got the day wrong.
He's on his way back.

18:58.804 --> 19:01.515
- What?!
- Trust him to spoil everything.

19:01.641 --> 19:04.143
- Well, what are you looking for?
- The key!

19:04.894 --> 19:07.897
- What key?
- The key to this.

19:07.938 --> 19:10.524
Oh, don't tell me you can't find it.

19:11.233 --> 19:13.736
- I know. It's in my handbag.
- Where's that?

19:13.861 --> 19:15.613
- Downstairs.
- Right.

19:16.364 --> 19:18.074
Oh!

19:21.577 --> 19:22.662
Help.

19:25.206 --> 19:27.416
Cor, I don't half fancy a drink.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.002
Food, sex and drink.
That's all you think about.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.564
Here, hold on. I've been inside
for more than a year, you know.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.507
That was your stupid fault.

19:34.632 --> 19:37.259
I could have understood it
if you'd've got nicked for the gold,

19:37.343 --> 19:40.513
but doin' over a copper...
I ask ya!

19:40.638 --> 19:42.515
- Well, I'd had a few, hadn't I?
- Yeah.

19:42.640 --> 19:43.933
Got carried away.

19:44.558 --> 19:46.519
Here, there's a pub over there.

20:08.040 --> 20:11.043
- Where was he phoning from?
- From a call box.

20:12.128 --> 20:13.796
Bloody marvellous.

20:18.926 --> 20:20.052
Ah!

20:20.219 --> 20:22.096
That was smashing.
Fancy another one?

20:22.221 --> 20:25.599
You still ain't told me
what you done with the gold.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.394
- I melted it down.
- You what?

20:28.519 --> 20:29.812
Ssh!

20:30.396 --> 20:32.624
I couldn't keep it hangin' about.
I had to get rid of it.

20:32.648 --> 20:33.774
So, where is it?

20:33.941 --> 20:35.669
You'd never guess
in a million years, old son.

20:35.693 --> 20:38.946
- Then tell me.
- It's at home.

20:39.196 --> 20:41.198
You must be out of your mind.

20:41.282 --> 20:43.200
The police can
search there any time.

20:43.325 --> 20:44.785
That's right. They already have,

20:44.869 --> 20:45.911
half a dozen times.

20:45.995 --> 20:48.622
But they never found anything,
never will.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.958
Even the old woman
don't know where it is.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.210
Come on, have another pint.

20:58.174 --> 21:00.926
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.

21:02.428 --> 21:04.180
Janice: Oh, my god.

21:06.974 --> 21:09.727
You crafty old sod.

21:09.852 --> 21:11.228
Nah, it was so simple.

21:11.312 --> 21:12.980
I used a welding torch, see.

21:13.147 --> 21:15.065
It was the mould
that was the difficult part.

21:15.191 --> 21:17.777
I tried out plaster of Paris,
but it wouldn't stand the heat,

21:17.818 --> 21:19.737
so I used Clay.

21:19.820 --> 21:22.865
- Looks like the real thing?
- You couldn't tell the difference.

21:23.032 --> 21:25.534
Except it's a bit heavy, like.
Yeah.

21:26.243 --> 21:28.162
Stroke of bloody genius, weren't it?

21:28.287 --> 21:30.581
Talk about sittin' on a fortune.

21:30.706 --> 21:32.708
I'll tell you
something else, sunshine.

21:32.833 --> 21:34.460
I've got a buyer lined up for it.

21:34.585 --> 21:37.755
Drink up, then.
Let's not keep him waiting.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.351
Come on, come on.

21:52.520 --> 21:54.063
It's not there.

21:56.941 --> 21:58.234
Wait a minute.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.777
I remember now.

22:00.486 --> 22:02.655
It's in my housecoat.

22:03.572 --> 22:06.200
And where exactly is your housecoat?

22:07.576 --> 22:09.245
In the bedroom.

22:09.745 --> 22:11.413
In the bedroom.

22:19.755 --> 22:21.382
What?

22:22.216 --> 22:24.635
- Well, you'd better be up for it.
- Right.

22:41.819 --> 22:44.196
Are you sure
it's in your housecoat?

22:44.280 --> 22:45.781
I think so.

22:49.910 --> 22:52.162
Hang about, hang about.

22:54.957 --> 22:56.208
Oh!

22:57.209 --> 22:59.295
It's all right, all right.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.590
What was he inside for?

23:02.715 --> 23:04.842
Grievous bodily harm.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.432
How much for this, mate?

24:05.861 --> 24:08.113
Here, what's this?

24:08.197 --> 24:09.698
It's covered in brown paint.

24:09.907 --> 24:12.242
I'll have to pay someone
to scrape it off, won't I?

24:12.409 --> 24:14.286
What are you talking about?
It's an antique.

24:14.370 --> 24:16.497
Look, mate,
that's all it's worth to me.

24:16.580 --> 24:19.917
If you want it back,
pick it up and piss off.

24:34.014 --> 24:35.265
- Wotcha, suze.
- Hi.

24:35.432 --> 24:38.435
- What's on today then, eh?
- Sausages. All right?

24:38.519 --> 24:41.355
Suppose it'll have to be.
Bottle of brown, please.

24:41.939 --> 24:43.649
Here, you look well.
You been away?

24:43.732 --> 24:45.275
Yeah. Been down to me mum's.

24:45.442 --> 24:47.778
- Costa del bognor.
- Oh, yeah.

25:05.713 --> 25:07.131
Hello, blackie.

25:07.214 --> 25:08.841
Ain't seen much of
you lately, have we?

25:08.966 --> 25:11.301
- Well...
- You know what I think?

25:11.969 --> 25:15.514
I think that you owe someone
some money. Don't he, stropper?

25:15.597 --> 25:18.308
Like about nine hundred nicker.

25:18.434 --> 25:20.227
Well, you don't think
I've forgotten, do ya?

25:20.352 --> 25:22.312
Come on, you know me.
I'm a man of me word.

25:22.438 --> 25:23.939
80's the guv'nor.

25:24.023 --> 25:26.358
He says some beautiful ones about you.

25:26.483 --> 25:29.778
Lovely ones.
He even wrote them down for us.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.867
Says here,

25:34.950 --> 25:38.662
"tell that lying git
that if he don't cough up,

25:38.829 --> 25:42.332
"we'll break every bone
in his horrible body

25:42.416 --> 25:45.335
"and stuff the bleeding lot
down his throat."

25:48.589 --> 25:50.466
Like poetry, ain't it?

25:52.301 --> 25:54.178
Are you threatening me?

25:54.261 --> 25:56.430
Do you hear
what he says, stropper?

26:00.267 --> 26:03.479
- Anything I can get you boys?
- Blackie: That's all right, love.

26:03.645 --> 26:06.125
We just popped in to have a talk
with our mate here, didn't we?

26:06.231 --> 26:08.942
Keep your voice down, blackie.
These people are friends of mine.

26:09.109 --> 26:13.739
That's all right. They'll be able to
visit you in hospital, won't they?

26:13.906 --> 26:16.825
- What do you mean?
- He says, what do we mean?

26:16.950 --> 26:18.035
Oh, leave it out.

26:18.160 --> 26:20.245
Look, one hot tip
and you iot'll be owing me money.

26:20.370 --> 26:23.540
- You know what it's like.
- They never learn, do they?

26:23.957 --> 26:27.294
I can't lose all the time.
It's against the law of averages.

26:27.419 --> 26:29.463
Sometimes you're up,
sometimes you're down.

26:29.630 --> 26:31.256
Yeah, that's right.

26:31.340 --> 26:34.176
And if you don't come up
with the readies on Saturday,

26:34.259 --> 26:35.677
you'll be up!

26:35.803 --> 26:38.472
Up the bleedin' creek,
you understand?

26:38.555 --> 26:39.807
All right, all right.

26:39.932 --> 26:42.601
Good. Nice to have seen ya.

26:43.519 --> 26:45.979
Come on, stropper.
You've had your say.

26:48.357 --> 26:49.650
Oh!

26:50.275 --> 26:51.735
I forgot.

26:52.820 --> 26:55.656
You know Willie Thompson, don't ya?

26:55.739 --> 26:58.117
- The electrician?
- Yeah, that's him.

26:58.283 --> 27:00.619
He's in st Martin's hospital.

27:00.661 --> 27:02.329
Why don't you go up and see him?

27:02.454 --> 27:05.124
He's had a terrible accident.

27:05.374 --> 27:07.543
Like the one you'll be having.

27:08.961 --> 27:10.546
Keep healthy.

27:42.244 --> 27:43.537
Janice!

27:43.579 --> 27:45.455
It's me, darlin'. I'm home.

27:50.002 --> 27:51.170
She must have gone shopping.

27:51.336 --> 27:54.423
I'm not interested in that.
All I wanna see is that gold.

27:54.590 --> 27:58.927
Not only can you see it, old mate,
you can bloody use it. Come on up.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.112
That's bloody marvellous.

28:17.237 --> 28:19.615
You couldn't tell it
from the real thing.

28:25.454 --> 28:27.080
It's bleeding plastic.

28:27.873 --> 28:29.333
You're bloody right.

28:29.625 --> 28:31.126
What the hell's going on?

28:31.293 --> 28:32.878
Billy!

28:33.378 --> 28:34.421
Ooh!

28:34.546 --> 28:36.757
You better start talking,
you silly bitch.

28:36.840 --> 28:39.301
Where's it gone, eh? Eh?
Who's got it?

28:50.187 --> 28:53.190
That lavatory seat
you've got in the window.

29:02.616 --> 29:06.036
It's a very unique piece, sir.

29:06.119 --> 29:08.330
Came from a stately home.

29:08.455 --> 29:10.040
Eleven quid.

29:10.249 --> 29:13.210
I don't want to buy the stately home,
just the lavatory seat.

29:13.293 --> 29:16.588
Cost me eight pounds.
I've gotta make a profit.

29:17.339 --> 29:18.799
Make it ten.

29:18.882 --> 29:20.425
- Five?
- Six.

29:20.550 --> 29:22.135
Five and a half?

29:22.719 --> 29:24.054
Okay.

30:14.521 --> 30:16.106
Willie?

30:23.697 --> 30:24.948
Hello, Willie.

30:25.282 --> 30:26.908
Hello.

30:27.868 --> 30:30.579
Some people will do anything
to get a day off work.

30:30.746 --> 30:33.081
You look like the invisible man.

30:36.501 --> 30:40.756
Yeah, I heard you was laid up, mate.
I didn't think it was as bad as this.

30:40.881 --> 30:42.299
Vvhathappened?

30:42.507 --> 30:44.593
Got beaten up.

30:44.718 --> 30:46.053
Yeah, but who did it?

30:46.178 --> 30:47.888
I don't know.

30:49.056 --> 30:50.474
Blackie.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.977
Oh, not blackie?
His friend stropper?

30:55.729 --> 30:56.938
Oh, yeah.

30:58.607 --> 31:00.108
Nice fella, stropper.

31:01.651 --> 31:05.739
Oh! Sorry.
I'm sorry, Willie. Er...

31:08.742 --> 31:11.578
Sorry. I'm sorry, Willie.
Sorry, Willie.

31:14.206 --> 31:15.916
I'm sorry, Willie.

31:16.625 --> 31:19.795
Here look, I bought you
a dirty magazine.

31:23.298 --> 31:25.801
Oh, yeah.
I can see your problem.

31:31.098 --> 31:32.808
Cheer up, Willie.

31:36.103 --> 31:39.648
Did you hear about the fella
that had to have his leg amputated?

31:39.731 --> 31:40.816
Hmm?

31:41.274 --> 31:43.485
When he woke up from the operation,
the doctor said,

31:43.610 --> 31:45.779
"we got some good news,
we got some bad news.

31:45.946 --> 31:47.531
"The bad news is,

31:47.614 --> 31:49.866
"we've chopped the wrong leg off.

31:49.950 --> 31:52.828
"The good news is,
the other one's got better."

31:59.334 --> 32:01.294
How much do you owe 'em, Willie?

32:01.378 --> 32:03.046
It must have been a bloody fortune.

32:03.130 --> 32:06.007
Uh-uh. Sixty-three.

32:06.633 --> 32:09.136
Sixty-three? Thousand?

32:13.348 --> 32:15.559
Sixty-three pounds.

32:16.518 --> 32:18.228
Sixty-three quid?

32:26.153 --> 32:28.029
See ya later, Willie.

32:31.450 --> 32:32.951
Keep healthy.

32:39.166 --> 32:41.918
Cheer up. It may never happen.

32:42.002 --> 32:43.253
It already has.

32:43.545 --> 32:46.298
Oh, well,
we've all got our problems.

32:46.381 --> 32:48.508
Here, what is it? What's wrong?

32:48.633 --> 32:50.385
I'd prefer not to talk about it.

32:51.178 --> 32:53.305
Please yourself.
I was only trying to help.

32:55.432 --> 32:56.975
I'm sorry.

33:02.898 --> 33:05.233
Here you are. Get this down you.

33:05.692 --> 33:09.988
- Oh, well, I haven't got any...
- Oh, it's all right. It's on the house.

33:10.071 --> 33:11.239
Thanks.

33:13.158 --> 33:16.036
Only a few more minutes to go.
I'm off early today.

33:16.161 --> 33:19.247
- Nice one.
- Oh, look, there's your two friends.

33:29.299 --> 33:31.593
Not speakin'?

33:31.676 --> 33:33.803
Friendly sort of geezer, ain't he?

33:33.887 --> 33:35.639
Come here.

33:40.727 --> 33:41.978
Sit down.

33:43.522 --> 33:45.398
Make yourself at home.

33:46.733 --> 33:49.694
Now then, what have
we done to upset ya?

33:49.778 --> 33:52.697
- Oh, nothing. Nothing at all.
- Well, then...

33:53.031 --> 33:54.824
Look, you'll get your money.

33:54.950 --> 33:58.828
It's only a few hours since I saw you.
Give us a break, for Christ's sake.

33:58.954 --> 34:01.748
- Have you been to see Willie?
- Yeah, I saw Willie.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.625
Nice fella, Willie.

34:03.708 --> 34:05.835
He didn't deserve
that bit of bad luck.

34:05.961 --> 34:10.298
And all over a mere sixty-three quid.
Ridiculous, ain't it?

34:10.382 --> 34:13.218
Sid: You've made your point.
Don't rub it in.

34:13.593 --> 34:15.011
In a hurry?

34:15.762 --> 34:16.763
Oh, well, yeah.

34:16.846 --> 34:19.075
I gotta raise 900 quid
by the end of the week, haven't I?

34:19.099 --> 34:20.392
So you have.

34:20.475 --> 34:22.269
And I've got an idea.

34:22.394 --> 34:24.938
Why don't you go round and
see old dodger?

34:25.021 --> 34:27.065
He might be able to help.

34:27.148 --> 34:28.900
Dodger Harris?

34:29.025 --> 34:32.028
He's as bent as a corkscrew.
What do you think I am, a villain?

34:32.112 --> 34:36.199
Did you hear me call him a villain?
It's you I'm thinkin' about.

34:36.324 --> 34:40.328
900 quid's not an easy matter
to raise in three days.

34:40.453 --> 34:43.248
Oh! Well, I'm so glad
you understand.

34:43.331 --> 34:45.292
Of course we understand.

34:45.417 --> 34:48.628
That's why I said 90 round
and see old dodger.

34:48.795 --> 34:51.381
Because, if you don't cough up,

34:51.548 --> 34:55.176
what happened to Willie
will seem like an itchy elbow

34:55.260 --> 34:57.929
compared to
what's gonna happen to you.

35:00.390 --> 35:03.184
- Thanks a lot.
- Don't mention it.

35:03.268 --> 35:06.021
See you Saturday.
Oh, by the way...

35:06.396 --> 35:08.481
Here's dodger's card.

35:09.149 --> 35:11.484
I'll tell him to expect ya.

35:11.568 --> 35:12.944
Keep healthy.

35:22.370 --> 35:24.873
Where are you going now, then?
Home?

35:24.998 --> 35:27.375
No, I might as well stay here
and slash me wrist.

35:27.459 --> 35:29.002
Look, I tell you what.

35:29.127 --> 35:32.672
Why don't you come back with me?
I'll cook you a nice meal.

35:42.349 --> 35:46.227
Here, sid. What did those two fellas
want today in the pub?

35:49.481 --> 35:52.817
Man on TV: And that concludes
our programmes for this evening.

35:52.901 --> 35:57.197
It only remains for me, Joseph gannon,
on behalf of all of us here...

37:04.305 --> 37:07.976
You came to my house yesterday
and took away my lavatory seat, right?

37:08.101 --> 37:10.287
Who the bleedin' hell are you?
How did you get in here, anyway?

37:10.311 --> 37:13.648
Never mind that.
Where's that bloody lavatory seat?

37:13.815 --> 37:16.401
You nicked it.
We could put you inside for that.

37:16.568 --> 37:19.738
- What are you talkin' about?
- I'll tell you what we're talkin' about.

37:19.946 --> 37:23.158
Yesterday, you came to my house
to do a job,

37:23.283 --> 37:26.202
and you took my lavatory seat
away with ya.

37:26.286 --> 37:27.286
I want it back.

37:27.328 --> 37:29.831
It's a load of old rubbish.
I gave your wife one...

37:29.914 --> 37:31.833
I mean,
I gave your wife a brand new one,

37:31.916 --> 37:33.251
and she still hasn't paid for it.

37:33.334 --> 37:35.462
Don't get funny with us, son,

37:35.587 --> 37:38.256
or you'll get this
down the back of your throat.

37:38.298 --> 37:39.674
Where is it?

37:40.842 --> 37:41.926
I sold it.

37:42.010 --> 37:43.845
- You what?
- Who to?

37:45.221 --> 37:49.350
- A junk shop.
- He sold it to a junk shop.

37:49.434 --> 37:53.730
Ah! That's nice. Come on, you.

37:53.813 --> 37:56.107
- Where are we going?
- Where do you think?

38:21.299 --> 38:24.052
- I'm not open.
- Look, I made a mistake yesterday.

38:24.135 --> 38:27.015
That bog seat is a family heirloom
or something. The owner wants it back.

38:27.138 --> 38:29.575
- Well, he can't have it, it's gone.
- What do you mean, gone?

38:29.599 --> 38:32.060
- I've sold it.
- Oh, Christ! Who to?

38:32.227 --> 38:34.687
How should I know?
I've never seen him before.

38:34.813 --> 38:37.398
Now piss off.
I'm going back to bed.

38:38.858 --> 38:41.486
- Who the hell are you?
- Never mind about that, fuzz-face.

38:41.611 --> 38:43.404
If we don't get our seat back,
you're for it.

38:43.530 --> 38:46.366
- So, who was it?
- I told him, I don't know.

38:46.491 --> 38:50.370
- Did he pay you by cheque?
- Yeah. I... I've still got it.

38:50.453 --> 38:52.205
Let's have a look.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.714
Now, we've saved ourselves
a bit of trouble.

39:01.798 --> 39:04.175
He's put his address on the back.

39:14.477 --> 39:17.146
Right. Now, get in there,
and get it back.

39:17.230 --> 39:18.898
And don't forget, son,
we're watching you.

39:18.982 --> 39:20.066
Well, what am I gonna say?

39:20.191 --> 39:23.611
You ain't been lost for words so far.
Go on, get goin'.

39:23.736 --> 39:25.488
Clumsy sod.

39:42.338 --> 39:44.382
I bought it legally.

39:44.507 --> 39:46.217
I've paid for it,
and I got a receipt.

39:46.301 --> 39:47.760
But it wasn't mine to sell.

39:47.886 --> 39:51.431
- Look, you changed the seat, right?
- Yeah, but it was a mistake.

39:51.514 --> 39:54.350
Well, I consider
that everything was in order.

39:54.434 --> 39:57.604
You were entitled to take it,
I'm entitled to keep it.

39:57.729 --> 40:00.440
Look, you gotta sell it back to me.
If you don't, I'll...

40:00.565 --> 40:02.108
If you don't,
I'll call the police

40:02.191 --> 40:04.652
and tell them you're
receiving stolen property.

40:04.777 --> 40:07.322
I was just about to let you have it.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.032
Now, I'm damned if I will.

40:09.115 --> 40:11.451
Get out of here
before I throw you out.

40:25.590 --> 40:27.926
- He won't sell it back.
- Won't he?

40:28.092 --> 40:30.637
Well, we'll see about that.
Come on.

40:48.529 --> 40:51.366
Where's your old man?
We want to talk with him.

40:51.491 --> 40:52.617
Who are you?

40:52.659 --> 40:54.744
Never mind who we are.
Where is he?

40:55.203 --> 40:57.038
I'll get him. You wait in there.

40:57.205 --> 41:00.041
- Well, go on, then.
- Henry!

41:00.208 --> 41:02.043
- Henry!
- "Henry."

41:09.133 --> 41:12.470
- Did you see her face? Shit scared.
- Yeah.

41:12.553 --> 41:14.406
Well, you have to show 'em
you mean business, don't ya?

41:14.430 --> 41:16.140
- Right.
- Tell you what.

41:16.307 --> 41:18.518
We'll give him one last chance
to sell it back,

41:18.601 --> 41:21.813
and if he don't,
we'll do it the hard way.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.120
Do you remember that bloke
we did it to...

41:24.148 --> 41:26.234
Yes, gentlemen.
What can I do for...

41:31.030 --> 41:33.366
- Those the men you were talking about?
- Yeah.

41:33.449 --> 41:36.285
Oh, I know them.
Right pair of villains, they are.

41:36.369 --> 41:38.389
Yeah, well, they made me come here.
I didn't want to threaten anyone.

41:38.413 --> 41:42.125
Yeah, hi, there.
Hello, chief inspector wallings here.

41:42.250 --> 41:46.045
Yeah. I think I've got a lead for you
on that union safe depositjob.

41:46.254 --> 41:49.674
Yeah. Pick me up at my house
as soon as you can, will you?

41:49.841 --> 41:53.344
- Right, well, I'll be off, then.
- Just a minute.

41:54.554 --> 42:00.476
You know, I believe there's more to
that lavatory seat than we thought.

42:00.893 --> 42:03.271
All this fuss over a bog seat.

42:03.730 --> 42:05.231
Scrape the paint off.

42:12.071 --> 42:13.531
Well?

42:13.614 --> 42:15.450
It's brass.

42:15.742 --> 42:17.452
Just as I thought.

42:17.535 --> 42:18.953
It's gold.

42:19.620 --> 42:21.581
Solid gold.

42:22.957 --> 42:25.001
I'll need you down at the station.

42:42.226 --> 42:43.603
Not you lot.

42:43.686 --> 42:45.855
I've had just about
enough for one day.

42:45.897 --> 42:48.066
I'm afraid you've got
another problem.

42:48.149 --> 42:50.777
- What's this?
- Your eviction papers.

42:50.860 --> 42:54.072
Sorry, but I did warn you,
didn't I, mr south?

42:54.155 --> 42:55.656
Good day.

43:45.790 --> 43:46.958
Man: Come in.

43:49.585 --> 43:51.504
- Dodger Harris?
- Yeah.

43:51.629 --> 43:53.172
Oh! Come in, lad.

43:53.256 --> 43:55.466
Come in, come in.
Sit down, sit down.

44:00.221 --> 44:02.348
Now, what can I do for you?

44:02.849 --> 44:04.600
I need some money, fast.

44:05.476 --> 44:07.353
I believe you might have a few ideas.

44:07.436 --> 44:09.355
My head teems with 'em.

44:10.189 --> 44:13.151
May one enquire
why you want this money fast?

44:13.276 --> 44:16.070
Yeah, well, the bookies
are after me for 900 quid.

44:16.154 --> 44:19.490
If I don't have the money by Saturday
at the latest...

44:19.615 --> 44:20.908
Oh, dear.

44:21.868 --> 44:25.413
- Oh, you do have a problem.
- Well, that's why I'm here.

44:26.080 --> 44:29.709
- Somebody recommended you to me.
- Who was this someone?

44:29.834 --> 44:32.336
- Blackie.
- Ah! Blackie.

44:32.837 --> 44:34.547
Any friend of blackie's is a...

44:34.672 --> 44:35.923
Friend of blackie's.

44:37.258 --> 44:39.802
Yeah, well, he's not
really a friend.

44:39.927 --> 44:42.013
In fact, it was him
who threatened to do me in.

44:42.096 --> 44:43.389
Oh, dear.

44:44.348 --> 44:45.766
What experience have you got?

44:45.975 --> 44:48.311
- Well, I'm a plumber.
- A plumber?

44:48.811 --> 44:51.272
- Ever been in any trouble?
- No, of course not.

44:52.773 --> 44:54.609
- That's a pity.
- Look...

44:55.651 --> 44:57.236
I don't want to do anything illegal.

44:57.320 --> 44:59.405
Perish the thought!

45:00.323 --> 45:02.074
Do you ever get seasick?

45:02.158 --> 45:03.659
Well, I'm all right
in a rowing boat.

45:03.784 --> 45:05.536
It's just I've got this something

45:05.620 --> 45:08.497
being dropped off a fishing boat
off the south coast.

45:08.664 --> 45:10.976
I'm looking for a likely lad
to pick it up. How about that?

45:11.000 --> 45:13.044
- What is it?
- Look, don't ask no questions,

45:13.169 --> 45:16.923
and if anybody asks you any questions,
you don't know any answers, right?

45:17.131 --> 45:20.885
Now, you'll need a frogman's suit,

45:20.968 --> 45:22.470
an oxygen lung,

45:22.637 --> 45:23.846
and you'll go down...

45:24.013 --> 45:25.014
Phew!

45:25.097 --> 45:26.641
Twenty fathoms.

45:27.433 --> 45:28.935
I can't swim.

45:30.436 --> 45:31.729
Buggen

45:34.190 --> 45:35.942
oh, here's something
right up your street.

45:36.067 --> 45:37.443
Jeweller's shop.

45:37.610 --> 45:40.988
- Not a smash and grab.
- For some perhaps, but not for you.

45:41.155 --> 45:44.825
There's a professional group,
a highly professional group,

45:44.909 --> 45:48.162
and they're looking for
a modicum of information.

45:48.496 --> 45:49.664
What sort of information?

45:49.789 --> 45:51.540
Well, they want a sketch map
of the basement

45:51.707 --> 45:53.852
showing the water pipes,
the gas mains and alarm system.

45:53.876 --> 45:55.646
And, as a plumber, of course
you've got the perfect cover.

45:55.670 --> 45:57.731
You just call in and say,
"I'm checking the water pressure,"

45:57.755 --> 45:59.173
and phfft, you're in.

45:59.298 --> 46:02.218
Well, that's not
worth 900 quid, is it?

46:02.426 --> 46:04.553
More or less.
More or less, yeah.

46:04.637 --> 46:05.846
How about it?

46:08.683 --> 46:10.393
What's the address?

46:34.709 --> 46:39.088
Actually, I wasn't aware
we had any trouble with the pressure.

46:39.171 --> 46:41.590
We can never get any
hot water, though.

46:41.674 --> 46:43.843
Maybe it's the thermostat.

46:44.510 --> 46:46.846
Er... perhaps you'd like
to have a look at it

46:46.929 --> 46:48.723
while you're down here.

46:48.889 --> 46:50.224
All right.

46:51.225 --> 46:54.020
Well, you don't have to hang about.
I'll call you if I need any help.

46:54.186 --> 46:55.604
Oh, we're not busy.

46:55.688 --> 46:57.398
Maybe I'll learn something.

46:59.025 --> 47:00.151
Yeah.

47:01.068 --> 47:03.029
Yeah. Well, it's, er...

47:03.112 --> 47:05.031
It's probably your, er...

47:05.489 --> 47:07.241
Safety valve.

47:24.925 --> 47:26.510
Man: Mr Bradley?

47:26.927 --> 47:31.390
Oh! Look, I'll leave you to it now.
I think they need me upstairs.

48:46.090 --> 48:50.678
Yeah, yeah. Right. Yeah, right, right.
Yeah. Right.

48:52.138 --> 48:55.099
They say you done a good job.
They're going in tomorrow night.

48:55.266 --> 48:57.184
Tomorrow night!

48:57.268 --> 48:59.228
Can't you let me
have a bit on account?

48:59.353 --> 49:03.107
Look, the moment I get my commission,
you get your fee.

49:03.232 --> 49:05.526
What could be fairer than that?

49:09.238 --> 49:12.616
- You don't look at all well, sid.
- Oh, I'm all right.

49:13.909 --> 49:16.871
Just been up to me eyeballs
in it lately, that's all.

49:17.037 --> 49:18.747
You didn't mind me
popping in, did you?

49:18.831 --> 49:20.875
No, of course not.

49:22.209 --> 49:23.878
What's the matter?

49:26.172 --> 49:27.756
Well, Suzie,

49:27.840 --> 49:29.800
things have been
a bit difficult lately.

49:30.926 --> 49:34.597
What, with the bills and the rent,
things have been getting out of hand.

49:34.763 --> 49:36.432
What do you mean?

49:38.058 --> 49:42.396
Come on, you can tell me.
A trouble shared and all that.

49:42.521 --> 49:46.025
No, you've got your own problems.
You don't want to hear about mine.

49:47.193 --> 49:48.694
Besides...

49:49.528 --> 49:51.238
You're a bit special, suze.

49:52.239 --> 49:53.574
You're not like the rest.

49:53.657 --> 49:56.911
Sid, why can't you
confide in me, eh?

49:56.994 --> 49:58.370
I'm sure it'd help.

49:59.371 --> 50:01.332
Well, maybe one day.

50:01.457 --> 50:04.418
But I've got to get meself
straightened out first.

50:04.627 --> 50:08.172
In the meantime,
I don't want you lying on my account.

50:09.215 --> 50:10.549
Here, look.

50:12.218 --> 50:14.178
I better get some sleep.

50:14.220 --> 50:16.305
You could stay here, you know.

50:20.017 --> 50:23.145
No, I think I'd better go home.
Don't you, eh?

50:57.555 --> 50:59.515
My god.

51:09.483 --> 51:12.319
- Here, what's going on in there?
- I don't know.

51:12.444 --> 51:15.698
- It ain't half bloody hot in here.
- Where's the safe, then?

51:15.781 --> 51:18.534
I don't know.
How can I see in this steam?

51:31.297 --> 51:32.506
Come on.

51:33.299 --> 51:35.509
Bert: I'm not that
bloody big, it's slim.

51:37.928 --> 51:40.431
I bet this steam will slim you up.

51:44.518 --> 51:46.937
You got your leg caught between...

52:02.411 --> 52:05.456
Christ almighty, Bert!
Let's get out of here! Get out!

52:14.465 --> 52:16.216
Man: Come on, Bert!

52:53.045 --> 52:54.296
Crappie!

52:57.633 --> 53:00.260
- Mr crapper!
- All right! All right!

53:02.304 --> 53:03.722
Oh, it's you.

53:07.935 --> 53:10.396
Where'd you spring from?
I thought you'd retired.

53:10.521 --> 53:13.357
- Yeah, well, I've been busy.
- Not for me, you haven't.

53:13.482 --> 53:14.858
You got any jobs, then?

53:15.025 --> 53:18.737
You're dead lucky.
Couple ofjobs come in this morning.

53:19.905 --> 53:22.533
Crappie, can you lend me some money?
I'm a bit skint.

53:22.616 --> 53:23.867
Yeah, all right, boy, yeah.

53:23.992 --> 53:26.912
- When you've finished yourjobs.
- Oh, come on, look.

53:27.037 --> 53:28.789
I just need a tenner.
A fiver'll do.

53:28.872 --> 53:32.292
I must say, I do get
a laugh out of you, son.

53:32.418 --> 53:34.712
Come on.

53:50.394 --> 53:52.813
- You phoned for a plumber.
- Did we?

53:53.439 --> 53:55.399
Well, yeah, I think so.

53:56.859 --> 53:59.111
Well, that'll be
the wife's department.

53:59.319 --> 54:01.447
Maisie, the plumber's here.

54:10.080 --> 54:12.332
Oh, you've come to fix
the garbage disposal.

54:12.416 --> 54:13.625
This way.

54:17.963 --> 54:21.300
We only moved in a month ago
and nothing seems to work.

54:21.467 --> 54:22.885
First, it was the cooker,

54:23.010 --> 54:25.429
then, during the heatwave,
the fridge went wrong.

54:25.512 --> 54:26.805
All the food went off.

54:26.972 --> 54:28.807
Then I had a problem
with my dishwasher.

54:28.891 --> 54:30.476
Smashed up all my crockery.

54:30.642 --> 54:32.436
You sound like
the original calamity Jane.

54:32.519 --> 54:34.855
You can say that again.

54:35.481 --> 54:38.233
There doesn't seem
to be much wrong with this.

54:38.692 --> 54:40.235
I don't even think
it's a plumbing job.

54:40.319 --> 54:42.571
I think you've got
a wire loose here.

54:42.696 --> 54:45.407
Look, would you mind
switching it on?

57:42.501 --> 57:43.794
Very good!

57:47.881 --> 57:51.468
Yeah, that was a fun game.

58:07.067 --> 58:08.860
- Excellent!
- Can you come at six?

58:08.986 --> 58:10.654
- Yeah, I can.
- That'll be great, yes.

58:10.737 --> 58:12.364
Oh, that'll be super.

58:21.456 --> 58:24.918
Ooh, I'm really hot.
I could do with a shower.

58:25.002 --> 58:26.586
Right, which one of us is going first?

58:26.712 --> 58:29.631
- Is it all right if it's me?
- Oh, yes. Okay.

58:30.924 --> 58:33.218
Woman #1:
I say, you missed a fabulous weekend.

58:33.427 --> 58:35.137
Woman #2:
Well, I was supposed to come.

58:35.345 --> 58:38.056
Woman #3: Yeah, what happened to you?
Did you go to Copenhagen?

58:38.140 --> 58:39.933
Mmm, I skipped Copenhagen.

58:40.017 --> 58:41.810
- Did you?
- Where did you go?

58:41.893 --> 58:44.479
Um... I had a very nice weekend.

58:45.689 --> 58:48.358
Do you remember
that photographer guy

58:48.483 --> 58:49.711
that I told you about ages ago?

58:49.735 --> 58:51.655
The one that I thought
was really chic and fancy?

58:51.778 --> 58:53.321
The one with the very tight jeans?

58:53.488 --> 58:54.924
- Woman #3: The open shirts?
- Woman #2: Mm-hmm.

58:54.948 --> 58:57.367
Well, I got a call on Friday.

58:57.451 --> 58:58.785
So tell me, what happened?

58:58.910 --> 59:01.288
- Well, he asked me away for the weekend.
- Yes.

59:01.413 --> 59:04.207
So then I phoned into the agency,
claimed I was sick.

59:04.332 --> 59:07.377
Scrapped Copenhagen
and we went to the new forest.

59:07.461 --> 59:08.855
- Woman #3: Really?
- Woman #2: Mmm.

59:08.879 --> 59:10.839
In that snazzy little
sports car of his.

59:10.964 --> 59:13.633
You can't do much in that
because we really tried!

59:13.759 --> 59:15.135
So go on. What happened?

59:15.218 --> 59:20.390
Well, that car might well be snazzy, but
it's definitely no love bug, I tell you.

59:20.515 --> 59:23.852
Honestly, I think I'm so battered
and bruised from that thing,

59:23.977 --> 59:26.438
I'll never explain
those away to Terry.

59:26.605 --> 59:29.691
Anyway, so eventually,
we had to pull off the road.

59:29.816 --> 59:33.195
- Couldn't stand it any longer.
- Yeah, 90 on.

59:33.737 --> 59:34.988
Well, I tell you one thing.

59:35.072 --> 59:38.617
The fantasy about having it off
in a cornfleld just doesn't work.

59:38.784 --> 59:40.327
Woman #1: Oh, that's impossible.

59:40.452 --> 59:44.331
Woman #2: A, the corn's too high and b,
it's so stony you don't know what to do.

59:44.456 --> 59:46.666
So we gave that up
and I just got muddy.

59:46.792 --> 59:50.629
But I will say one thing,
he chose a really super hotel.

59:50.754 --> 59:53.298
And you can't tell me
any guy hadn't pre-planned that.

59:53.465 --> 59:55.217
He knew what
he was doing, all right.

59:55.383 --> 59:57.803
Oh, the water's lovely and warm.

1:00:01.807 --> 1:00:03.433
- Oh, do you know what?
- What?

1:00:03.558 --> 1:00:05.977
The bed there was
at least eight foot wide.

1:00:08.146 --> 1:00:09.648
Oh, we had a super time.

1:00:09.773 --> 1:00:12.567
I tell you something, we must have
used every inch of that bed.

1:00:12.734 --> 1:00:15.362
- Woman #1: Really?
- And do you know my fantasy?

1:00:15.487 --> 1:00:16.807
- Woman #3: What?
- Woman #1: Yes?

1:00:16.947 --> 1:00:20.408
Well, I really did it this time.
I went through with it.

1:00:20.534 --> 1:00:22.369
And do you know what,
it really worked.

1:00:22.452 --> 1:00:23.995
I went into the bathroom

1:00:24.079 --> 1:00:27.332
and I knew he thought I was going to
come out with some chic négligée on,

1:00:27.457 --> 1:00:29.459
but I didn't.
I did it, the full strip.

1:00:29.668 --> 1:00:32.754
One stocking out the door,
two stockings out the door

1:00:32.879 --> 1:00:36.174
and brother, did that turn him on.
Oh, do you know what?

1:00:36.258 --> 1:00:39.052
I think after that we must have
screwed for at least four hours.

1:00:39.136 --> 1:00:40.137
Cor!

1:00:48.311 --> 1:00:49.479
Hello.

1:01:20.594 --> 1:01:22.429
Turn that engine off.

1:01:24.097 --> 1:01:25.849
I can't stop, blackie. I'm late.

1:01:25.974 --> 1:01:29.519
- Yeah. Two days late, ain't he, stropper?
- Sid: What do you mean?

1:01:29.644 --> 1:01:31.563
We said Saturday, remember?

1:01:31.730 --> 1:01:34.024
We was waiting in that pub
for hours and hours.

1:01:34.107 --> 1:01:35.233
Look, I've got to go.

1:01:35.358 --> 1:01:37.736
I've got an appointment
with a very important man.

1:01:38.570 --> 1:01:41.114
- What are you doing?
- It's what we're gonna do.

1:01:41.239 --> 1:01:42.824
Cop that bike.

1:01:43.491 --> 1:01:46.995
- Right, this is for starters.
- Here, leave that bike alone.

1:01:47.495 --> 1:01:51.791
Blackie: Get off that bike, you berk.
You ain't even got a licence.

1:01:51.917 --> 1:01:55.420
Look, it's all fixed up.
I'm doing this job for dodger.

1:01:55.879 --> 1:01:58.965
He's gonna let me have 900 quid
by the end of next week latest.

1:01:59.090 --> 1:02:01.343
- What little job?
- I can't tell you, can I?

1:02:01.468 --> 1:02:04.804
You know what line of business he's in.
You put me on to him.

1:02:04.930 --> 1:02:06.210
I've learned my bleedin' lesson.

1:02:06.306 --> 1:02:08.975
I never want to see another bookie
till the day I die.

1:02:09.059 --> 1:02:11.519
That day may come
sooner than you think.

1:02:11.645 --> 1:02:12.938
Tuesday.

1:02:13.063 --> 1:02:15.124
Make it Tuesday. I'll tell him
it's a matter of life and death.

1:02:15.148 --> 1:02:16.316
It is!

1:02:16.816 --> 1:02:18.944
Well, look, actually, er...

1:02:19.027 --> 1:02:20.779
He's giving me a thousand.

1:02:21.196 --> 1:02:23.990
- I want you to have the other hundred.
- Why?

1:02:24.658 --> 1:02:26.076
Well...

1:02:26.159 --> 1:02:28.161
Well, I kept you waiting, blackie.

1:02:28.578 --> 1:02:32.123
And I don't like
owing people money, do I?

1:02:36.795 --> 1:02:40.465
A hundred, is it?
Right, I believe ya.

1:02:40.590 --> 1:02:44.844
But you'll never see Wednesday
if you let us down on Tuesday.

1:02:44.970 --> 1:02:48.932
Them's me last words. Hop it.

1:02:57.983 --> 1:03:00.610
- What happened?
- The geyser overheated.

1:03:01.069 --> 1:03:03.989
And set off the alarm
and the sprinkler system.

1:03:04.155 --> 1:03:07.325
- Great.
- Plain bloody bad luck.

1:03:07.575 --> 1:03:09.202
The boys lost all their gear.

1:03:09.369 --> 1:03:11.830
Anyway, they didn't get caught
and that's what matters.

1:03:11.997 --> 1:03:13.498
What about me? I'm right in it.

1:03:13.707 --> 1:03:17.002
In this game,
you take the rough with the smooth.

1:03:17.711 --> 1:03:19.671
Anyway, think of
the commission I lost.

1:03:19.879 --> 1:03:22.340
Dodger, I've got
other things on me mind.

1:03:22.465 --> 1:03:24.384
I could be dead in two days.

1:03:24.509 --> 1:03:26.761
We'll find something for you.

1:03:29.889 --> 1:03:31.099
Here, look.

1:03:31.599 --> 1:03:34.853
Ideal! You can't fail.
It's money in your pocket.

1:03:34.936 --> 1:03:36.313
What is it?

1:03:43.737 --> 1:03:45.423
Christ! These are
a bit strong, aren't they?

1:03:45.447 --> 1:03:48.366
Well, the gentleman in question
has been a naughty boy

1:03:48.491 --> 1:03:50.594
and I don't suppose for one moment
he'd like the pictures

1:03:50.618 --> 1:03:52.704
to go to his dear wife.

1:03:52.871 --> 1:03:55.457
So, wander round
and offer him the negatives.

1:03:55.623 --> 1:03:58.418
Go for the highest price.
I'd start about 5,000.

1:04:00.545 --> 1:04:02.797
- That's blackmail.
- Blackmail?

1:04:03.173 --> 1:04:06.259
Blackmail, Sidney, is an ugly word.

1:04:06.593 --> 1:04:08.678
You are a salesman.

1:04:08.762 --> 1:04:12.223
You have a commodity,
so you take it to the highest bidder.

1:04:12.307 --> 1:04:15.560
If the first potential customer
doesn't want to know,

1:04:15.685 --> 1:04:18.521
you go to
the second potential customer.

1:04:18.646 --> 1:04:21.775
- Sounds all right when you put it like that.
- 'Course it does.

1:04:21.900 --> 1:04:24.027
This charteris is a rich man.

1:04:24.110 --> 1:04:26.738
He's got a string
of massage parlours.

1:04:26.946 --> 1:04:28.823
He's the answer to all your problems.

1:04:28.990 --> 1:04:31.576
But a lot depends
on how you handle the sale.

1:04:31.659 --> 1:04:33.870
So, put on your best suit.

1:04:33.953 --> 1:04:36.623
Cut a dash. Look prosperous.

1:04:36.706 --> 1:04:38.917
Tell him it's big business.

1:04:39.042 --> 1:04:40.377
Impress him.

1:04:41.920 --> 1:04:43.713
I haven't got a suit.

1:04:57.519 --> 1:04:59.813
"And, under the terms
of the settlement,

1:04:59.938 --> 1:05:04.067
"one half of the net profits
are incorporated in the agreement.

1:05:04.192 --> 1:05:07.278
"I am, however,
negotiating a cash settlement,

1:05:07.362 --> 1:05:10.448
"but, until this has been sorted out,
I'm not in a position

1:05:10.532 --> 1:05:13.660
"to discuss any new
partnership agreement.

1:05:13.868 --> 1:05:19.249
"I'll be in touch with you immediately
the situation has been ratified.

1:05:19.416 --> 1:05:22.794
"Yours sincerely, ar charteris."

1:05:22.877 --> 1:05:25.130
A mr south is outside.
He'd like to have a word with you.

1:05:25.255 --> 1:05:26.464
Oh, who the hell is he?

1:05:26.589 --> 1:05:29.134
You know I don't see anybody
except by appointment.

1:05:29.217 --> 1:05:31.219
But I told him
and he wouldn't go away.

1:05:31.344 --> 1:05:34.973
He asked me to give you this.
He said you'd understand.

1:05:35.515 --> 1:05:38.393
Yes. I think I do understand.

1:05:38.476 --> 1:05:41.229
Um...
Show mr south in, will you?

1:05:41.771 --> 1:05:45.024
Ooh, by the way,
what's belinda doing?

1:05:45.108 --> 1:05:48.695
Oh, well, nothing at the moment.
One of her clients just cancelled.

1:05:48.778 --> 1:05:51.489
- Mr charteris will see you.
- Ah, mr, er...

1:05:52.532 --> 1:05:54.451
- South.
- Mr south.

1:05:54.534 --> 1:05:56.244
Now, while I'm getting dressed,

1:05:56.369 --> 1:05:59.622
I'd like you to enjoy
a vigorating massage on the house.

1:05:59.747 --> 1:06:01.708
No, thanks. I've come
to discuss business.

1:06:01.833 --> 1:06:04.114
Yes, of course, but I'd like you
to be completely relaxed,

1:06:04.210 --> 1:06:06.880
so you'll be
in a better condition to...

1:06:06.963 --> 1:06:08.256
Discuss business.

1:06:11.134 --> 1:06:12.719
Yeah, all right.

1:06:13.219 --> 1:06:15.972
But I'm a busy man, mr charteris.

1:06:16.055 --> 1:06:18.391
I wanna get this matter
over and done with.

1:06:18.475 --> 1:06:22.270
I hope you fully appreciate
the delicacy of the situation.

1:06:22.854 --> 1:06:24.856
You are a reasonable man,
I understand?

1:06:24.898 --> 1:06:27.692
Oh, I am, mr south. I am.

1:06:27.775 --> 1:06:30.320
Just lie down there
and enjoy yourself.

1:06:30.445 --> 1:06:33.823
Come and see me in my office
when you've finished.

1:06:45.376 --> 1:06:47.378
What's your name then, eh?

1:06:48.922 --> 1:06:50.215
Not speakin'?

1:06:51.049 --> 1:06:52.634
That's all right.

1:06:52.800 --> 1:06:54.844
I like a bit of mystery in my women.

1:06:54.928 --> 1:06:55.970
Not too much, though.

1:06:56.095 --> 1:06:57.722
Ooh, that's nice.

1:07:00.725 --> 1:07:02.268
Ooh!

1:07:08.274 --> 1:07:10.235
Ooh! I'll tell you what.

1:07:10.693 --> 1:07:14.322
You can eat crackers
in my bed any time, eh?

1:07:23.456 --> 1:07:25.416
Oh, Christ!

1:07:31.464 --> 1:07:34.133
Me leg! You're breaking me leg!

1:07:34.175 --> 1:07:36.135
You'll break me leg!

1:07:36.386 --> 1:07:39.973
Get off! Get off! Oh, get off!

1:07:42.183 --> 1:07:46.729
No! No, no, no. No! No! Ooh! Ah!

1:07:46.896 --> 1:07:49.065
Ah! Ooh! Ow!

1:07:49.148 --> 1:07:51.484
No, no! Not that! No!

1:07:59.534 --> 1:08:00.618
Easy!

1:08:10.545 --> 1:08:12.297
Enjoying yourself?

1:08:12.839 --> 1:08:15.967
And that'll teach you to try
blackmailing me, you little bastard.

1:08:16.134 --> 1:08:18.136
And you can tell whoever it was
who sent you

1:08:18.219 --> 1:08:20.346
that they can stuff
the rest of those photographs

1:08:20.471 --> 1:08:22.616
because they're not worth
the paper they're printed on.

1:08:22.640 --> 1:08:24.434
Well, your wife!
What about your wife?

1:08:24.517 --> 1:08:27.645
I haven't got one.
We were divorced a year ago.

1:08:31.316 --> 1:08:33.943
- Hello, dodger.
- Hello, Sidney!

1:08:35.194 --> 1:08:37.905
Charteris was divorced a year ago.

1:08:37.989 --> 1:08:39.907
Why don't you
get your records straight?

1:08:40.033 --> 1:08:42.833
- I nearly had me bleedin' neck broken.
- The story of my life, Sidney.

1:08:42.869 --> 1:08:44.746
You know,
I never could get nothing straight.

1:08:44.871 --> 1:08:47.957
I'm not interested in your life, dodger.
I'm at death's door.

1:08:48.082 --> 1:08:50.251
Well, don't panic, Sidney.
I mean, um...

1:08:50.376 --> 1:08:52.021
Old dodger
will pull something out of the hat.

1:08:52.045 --> 1:08:53.963
How do you think I've survived so far?

1:08:54.047 --> 1:08:55.247
That's a bloody good question.

1:08:55.340 --> 1:08:58.551
Look, I've got something special
for you, Sidney.

1:09:00.011 --> 1:09:02.722
A certain gentleman, whose
Name cannot be divulged,

1:09:02.847 --> 1:09:04.849
but who is not short
of a small fortune or two,

1:09:04.974 --> 1:09:08.436
is desirous of laying his hands
on a, um... certain work of art.

1:09:08.561 --> 1:09:10.897
- Eh?
- Have you heard of Picasso?

1:09:11.064 --> 1:09:15.276
Now look, I'm not havin'
anything to do with the mafia.

1:09:15.401 --> 1:09:17.403
The mafia! He's pig ignorant.

1:09:17.487 --> 1:09:20.448
Picasso is one of
the greatest painters ever.

1:09:20.573 --> 1:09:21.991
And one of his masterpieces

1:09:22.075 --> 1:09:24.744
is hanging on the wall of
a mansion not very far from here.

1:09:24.869 --> 1:09:25.703
Go on.

1:09:25.787 --> 1:09:29.207
I want you, dear Sidney,
to obtain it by fair means or foul.

1:09:29.332 --> 1:09:31.918
And hang in its place this copy,

1:09:32.001 --> 1:09:34.754
which I've had prepared
at great expense.

1:09:34.879 --> 1:09:36.923
Oh, you're not asking me
to pinch a painting?

1:09:37.048 --> 1:09:38.716
I'm not asking you
to pinch a painting.

1:09:38.800 --> 1:09:41.219
I'm asking you
to arrange a swapping.

1:09:41.386 --> 1:09:44.180
- And what happens when they find out?
- "Find out"!

1:09:44.347 --> 1:09:47.767
They couldn't tell a Picasso
from a giraffe's arse-o.

1:09:49.477 --> 1:09:50.978
How do I get into the place?

1:09:51.104 --> 1:09:52.689
Pull the old
water board routine again.

1:09:52.814 --> 1:09:54.583
Say you've gone round
to check the water pressure

1:09:54.607 --> 1:09:56.609
and, while you're at it,
suss the joint out.

1:09:56.693 --> 1:10:00.697
Then, having secreted this copy
somewhere about your person,

1:10:00.863 --> 1:10:02.907
at the appropriate moment,

1:10:02.990 --> 1:10:04.367
swap it.

1:10:05.410 --> 1:10:07.286
- Swap it?
- Swap it.

1:10:07.537 --> 1:10:09.872
And, this time,
nothing can go wrong.

1:10:09.997 --> 1:10:12.750
Old dodger gives you
his personal guarantee.

1:10:12.875 --> 1:10:15.628
After all, it's only a swapping.

1:10:57.086 --> 1:10:58.686
Woman: What are you doing,
standing there

1:10:58.713 --> 1:11:00.339
without a drink in your hand, huh?

1:11:00.506 --> 1:11:03.801
Sakes alive, there's enough liquor
around here to sink a battleship.

1:11:03.968 --> 1:11:06.929
Lucinda, honey! There.

1:11:07.054 --> 1:11:12.185
No-one shall ever say Loretta proudfoot
lacks one iota of southern hospitality.

1:11:12.351 --> 1:11:15.688
Even though she is
6,000 miles away from home.

1:11:15.938 --> 1:11:17.190
Oh, you're mrs proudfoot?

1:11:17.398 --> 1:11:20.777
Oh! I'm sorry, honey.
I thought you were a guest.

1:11:20.985 --> 1:11:24.822
- Oh, no, I'm a plumber.
- A plumber. Did I call for a plumber?

1:11:25.156 --> 1:11:28.117
Well, the council sent me.
Your water pressure's all over the place.

1:11:28.326 --> 1:11:32.079
Loretta, darling.
You've been holding out on me.

1:11:32.497 --> 1:11:34.332
Where have you been hiding this one?

1:11:34.415 --> 1:11:37.084
Loretta: This is Hubert,
one of my dearest friends.

1:11:37.210 --> 1:11:40.213
- Hubert, meet, um...
- Sid.

1:11:41.297 --> 1:11:44.175
Oh! What a lovely name.

1:11:44.217 --> 1:11:48.471
- Loretta: He's a plumber.
- A plumber! How interesting.

1:11:48.638 --> 1:11:52.016
Well, you can shove your plunger
round my s-bend any day.

1:11:53.726 --> 1:11:55.978
I'll hit you over
the bleedin' head with it.

1:11:56.103 --> 1:11:58.314
Ooh! Any time.

1:11:58.648 --> 1:12:02.568
He's so butch, dear.
I'll see you later, heart-face.

1:12:05.196 --> 1:12:06.739
Loretta:
You must forgive Hubert.

1:12:06.864 --> 1:12:09.575
He's not afraid to say
exactly how he feels.

1:12:09.784 --> 1:12:11.452
That's all right.
It don't bother me.

1:12:11.536 --> 1:12:14.789
Good. 'Cause I believe
in everybody being themselves.

1:12:14.914 --> 1:12:18.876
My late husband, who was
a psychiatrist, always said

1:12:19.001 --> 1:12:23.965
the trouble with the world
was sexual frustration.

1:12:25.716 --> 1:12:26.759
Very true.

1:12:26.884 --> 1:12:29.303
So, every now and again,
I like to have a little get-together

1:12:29.470 --> 1:12:32.974
where all my friends
can lose all their inhibitions.

1:12:33.057 --> 1:12:36.936
Oh, yeah. You mean, sort of, er...
Let it all hang out?

1:12:37.103 --> 1:12:40.773
Exactly.
Oh, Robin, honey, this is sid.

1:12:40.815 --> 1:12:45.278
My! Samantha's got a sparkle
in her eye tonight, haven't you, honey?

1:12:45.444 --> 1:12:49.574
She's sparkling at everybody.
I can't keep her away from the men.

1:12:50.074 --> 1:12:52.535
And you know what I'm like.
I get so jealous.

1:12:52.618 --> 1:12:56.706
I was in two minds about coming tonight,
but she insisted, didn't you, dear?

1:12:56.789 --> 1:12:59.792
Oh, she couldn't wait
to lose her inhibitions.

1:12:59.876 --> 1:13:02.795
The moment she stepped into the room,
she took all her clothes off.

1:13:02.879 --> 1:13:05.464
With a body like that,
how can you blame her?

1:13:05.590 --> 1:13:08.968
Hasn't she got
the most beautiful shape?

1:13:10.761 --> 1:13:12.805
- Fantastic, yeah.
- Tell me,

1:13:12.930 --> 1:13:15.057
do you think I was right
to bring her?

1:13:15.892 --> 1:13:18.686
- Yeah.
- I know why you're saying that.

1:13:18.769 --> 1:13:20.479
You fancy her yourself,
don't you?

1:13:20.605 --> 1:13:21.898
Loretta: Now, now, Robin,

1:13:22.064 --> 1:13:26.694
sid is not a man to step in between
two people who love each other.

1:13:26.777 --> 1:13:29.655
You really must try
to stop being so jealous,

1:13:29.739 --> 1:13:33.743
and I mustn't keep you from
your duties for one moment longer.

1:14:10.321 --> 1:14:13.157
Loretta:
Enjoying yourself, honey? Fine.

1:14:13.366 --> 1:14:17.036
By the way, what actually
is wrong with my water?

1:14:17.411 --> 1:14:19.538
Um... well, it's not
running properly.

1:14:19.664 --> 1:14:21.791
It's throwing the whole area
out of balance.

1:14:29.548 --> 1:14:31.384
Woman: Get off me!

1:14:33.219 --> 1:14:34.637
Excuse me.

1:14:37.682 --> 1:14:38.975
Excuse me!

1:14:39.767 --> 1:14:41.560
- You've got my plunger.
- Your what?

1:14:41.686 --> 1:14:44.188
Well, it's stuck to your ar...
Well, I'll have to have it back.

1:14:44.313 --> 1:14:45.773
Do you mind?

1:14:47.024 --> 1:14:49.318
Well, I've got to get it back.

1:14:58.911 --> 1:15:02.456
Okay, everyone,
it's time to go fishin'.

1:15:02.498 --> 1:15:04.375
Now, you all know the rules.

1:15:04.583 --> 1:15:07.753
Each one of you
has to fish for his or her partner.

1:15:07.878 --> 1:15:10.840
And once you've hooked them,
they're yours for the night.

1:15:10.923 --> 1:15:14.969
One, two, three,
everyone into the water!

1:16:08.022 --> 1:16:11.150
Hey, no! Oh, no, no! Look.

1:16:11.275 --> 1:16:14.904
Look, I'm only the plumber.
I'm only the plumber!

1:16:14.987 --> 1:16:17.531
I'm only the plumber!

1:16:27.041 --> 1:16:29.418
My Picasso's in the water!

1:16:29.543 --> 1:16:31.754
Somebody fish it out.
The colours'll run.

1:16:33.339 --> 1:16:35.633
You! You took it!

1:16:35.883 --> 1:16:37.885
You're not a plumber,
you're a thief!

1:16:38.385 --> 1:16:41.263
The police.
Somebody ring for the police!

1:16:41.680 --> 1:16:45.559
- I'm not a thief. It belongs to me.
- Belongs to you! It's mine.

1:16:45.726 --> 1:16:48.896
There's not another like it
in the whole wide world.

1:16:48.979 --> 1:16:51.357
Your bleedin' Picasso's
hangin' on the wall.

1:16:51.440 --> 1:16:52.733
Turn round, have a look.

1:16:52.817 --> 1:16:55.611
Well, what's that doing there, then?

1:16:56.362 --> 1:16:59.865
- Well, it's not worth tuppence, it's a copy.
- A copy!

1:17:00.574 --> 1:17:03.410
I know what you were gonna do!

1:17:14.922 --> 1:17:16.173
Samantha!

1:17:17.174 --> 1:17:18.843
He's killed her.

1:17:20.136 --> 1:17:21.846
He's done her in.

1:17:26.892 --> 1:17:29.728
- Ah! You got it.
- No, I didn't get it.

1:17:29.854 --> 1:17:32.231
Well, why not?

1:17:33.023 --> 1:17:34.316
There was a party going on,

1:17:34.441 --> 1:17:37.069
and one thing led to another,
and I didn't do the swap.

1:17:37.153 --> 1:17:40.406
Look, dodger, I'm not interested
in any more of your little schemes.

1:17:40.573 --> 1:17:43.742
As much as I need the money, I don't
fancy spending next Christmas inside.

1:17:43.868 --> 1:17:46.537
Oh, well, Sidney,
remember the old saying.

1:17:46.745 --> 1:17:50.916
"If at first you don't succeed,
try, try, try again."

1:17:51.041 --> 1:17:53.294
I'm not tryin' anythin' else.
That's final.

1:17:53.419 --> 1:17:57.298
Oh, that's a shame, Sidney.
'Cause I've got a smasher here.

1:17:57.423 --> 1:17:59.800
You couldn't go wrong with this one.

1:17:59.884 --> 1:18:01.385
Tower of London.

1:18:02.219 --> 1:18:03.387
Dodger...

1:18:03.846 --> 1:18:05.514
Stuff it!

1:18:33.876 --> 1:18:35.377
- Good morning.
- Man: Morning.

1:18:35.544 --> 1:18:38.881
- Do you, er... you buy bikes?
- Yeah.

1:18:39.089 --> 1:18:41.634
Well, what about this mighty machine
out here, then, eh?

1:18:41.800 --> 1:18:43.761
I'll have a look at it.

1:19:00.110 --> 1:19:02.279
Done a lot of mileage, hasn't it?

1:19:02.404 --> 1:19:06.200
Just goes to show how honest I am.
I could have easily fixed the clock.

1:19:06.367 --> 1:19:07.868
Tyres are well worn.

1:19:07.952 --> 1:19:10.704
Oh, come on.
What's a couple of tyres?

1:19:10.871 --> 1:19:12.998
What do you want, part exchange?

1:19:13.123 --> 1:19:15.459
Well, no.
I've got to sell it actually.

1:19:15.668 --> 1:19:17.103
I don't want to,
but I've got no choice.

1:19:17.127 --> 1:19:18.671
Need money in a hurry, do ya?

1:19:18.837 --> 1:19:21.423
No, no. I know this geezer
who's selling a sports car.

1:19:21.548 --> 1:19:22.925
Real bargain.

1:19:23.050 --> 1:19:26.178
But unless I give him the money today,
no go.

1:19:26.345 --> 1:19:28.639
Where's the registration book?

1:19:32.601 --> 1:19:35.896
- Any hire purchase on it?
- Yeah, why?

1:19:36.438 --> 1:19:39.191
- How many payments you made?
- Two.

1:19:40.693 --> 1:19:43.946
You can't sell it.
It's not yours to sell.

1:19:44.655 --> 1:19:47.533
Well, it's my property.
I bought it, didn't I?

1:19:47.658 --> 1:19:51.412
It's not your property
until you've made the last payment.

1:19:51.578 --> 1:19:54.999
- You mean I can't sell it anywhere?
- It's not yours to sell.

1:19:55.124 --> 1:19:59.336
You try selling that bike to anybody else,
and you'll get put inside.

1:20:02.464 --> 1:20:06.010
- Oh, you're not going away.
- Yeah. I've come to say goodbye.

1:20:06.135 --> 1:20:08.304
I've got meself a job
on one of them oil rigs.

1:20:08.387 --> 1:20:10.264
I'll be earning thousands.

1:20:10.431 --> 1:20:14.643
I suppose that's good news.
When do you leave?

1:20:15.769 --> 1:20:16.895
Today.

1:20:18.439 --> 1:20:22.067
- Wish I could come with ya.
- Well, I'll be back in a few months.

1:20:22.192 --> 1:20:24.570
Me pockets'll be bulging.
We'll have a great time.

1:20:24.695 --> 1:20:27.031
Go everywhere, see everything.

1:20:27.156 --> 1:20:29.241
Man: Twenty dunhills, please.

1:21:36.934 --> 1:21:38.936
Just going down the bank.

1:21:39.019 --> 1:21:40.145
To get the money.

1:21:40.270 --> 1:21:42.040
That's all right.
We'll walk down there with ya.

1:21:42.064 --> 1:21:43.816
Keep ya company.

1:21:43.857 --> 1:21:45.359
Won't we, stropper?

1:21:46.151 --> 1:21:48.529
You still don't trust me, do you, eh?

1:21:48.654 --> 1:21:51.281
I'm not going to emigrate.
It's only a thousand quid.

1:21:51.365 --> 1:21:54.034
Well, that's all right.
We'll still walk down there with ya.

1:21:54.159 --> 1:21:55.828
Guv'nor's orders.

1:21:56.703 --> 1:21:59.081
Yeah, well, you don't have to
put yourselves out.

1:21:59.206 --> 1:22:02.418
You sound like
you don't want us with ya, sid.

1:22:02.584 --> 1:22:05.295
You're not tryin' anything on,
are ya?

1:22:06.255 --> 1:22:08.590
Don't tear his clothes.

1:22:08.799 --> 1:22:12.010
They'll be worth a few quid
when we get 'em off him.

1:22:14.638 --> 1:22:16.390
On second thoughts.

1:22:18.684 --> 1:22:20.811
Come on, blackie.
The bank'll be closed.

1:22:20.936 --> 1:22:23.397
So what?
You ain't got nothing in it.

1:22:23.480 --> 1:22:25.023
I ain't thick.

1:22:26.567 --> 1:22:28.068
What's in the bag?

1:22:28.193 --> 1:22:29.278
Well, it's, er...

1:22:29.361 --> 1:22:32.072
It's me laundry. I pass
the laundry on the way to the bank.

1:22:32.197 --> 1:22:33.532
Open it up.

1:22:41.081 --> 1:22:42.749
You're dead right.

1:22:44.001 --> 1:22:45.794
You ain't emigrating.

1:22:45.919 --> 1:22:49.339
They don't take cripples
in these foreign countries.

1:22:50.924 --> 1:22:54.052
Stropper, your moment has come.

1:22:57.639 --> 1:22:59.475
I never did you any harm.

1:22:59.558 --> 1:23:02.895
I didn't say you did.
It's me job, innit?

1:23:06.398 --> 1:23:08.650
You never gave me a chance.

1:23:08.734 --> 1:23:10.360
You didn't give me enough time.

1:23:10.444 --> 1:23:13.363
You're breakin' me bleedin' heart.

1:23:13.447 --> 1:23:14.698
Stropper!

1:23:17.326 --> 1:23:19.745
Mister, this is private business.

1:23:19.870 --> 1:23:22.331
My apologies,
but I have to speak to mr south.

1:23:22.414 --> 1:23:24.625
So do we, and we saw him first.

1:23:24.708 --> 1:23:27.044
I'm from the
bovine insurance company.

1:23:27.127 --> 1:23:29.087
He won't be needin' any.
Push off!

1:23:29.171 --> 1:23:30.422
I'm not selling insurance.

1:23:30.506 --> 1:23:32.466
Here, don't I know you?

1:23:32.549 --> 1:23:33.717
I was at the police station

1:23:33.800 --> 1:23:36.887
when you made a statement
about that, er... lavatory seat.

1:23:37.012 --> 1:23:39.473
- Oh, that's right, yeah. I remember.
- Lavatory seat?

1:23:39.640 --> 1:23:43.393
I'm pleased to inform you, mr south,
that you are due for the reward.

1:23:43.477 --> 1:23:44.811
A thousand pounds.

1:23:44.895 --> 1:23:47.814
For giving information leading to
the recovery of stolen property.

1:23:47.981 --> 1:23:50.651
Now, if you'll just sign this receipt.

1:23:52.778 --> 1:23:54.863
Turn your back, stropper.

1:24:00.452 --> 1:24:02.746
My apologies for
the interruption, gentlemen.

1:24:02.829 --> 1:24:04.081
Good day.

1:24:06.208 --> 1:24:09.795
- A thousand quid.
- Where's your bank?

1:24:12.923 --> 1:24:14.550
Mr rockefeller.

1:24:14.716 --> 1:24:17.594
Hello, boy.
I heard all about your windfall.

1:24:17.678 --> 1:24:19.763
Yeah, so did the bookies.
Took the lot.

1:24:19.930 --> 1:24:21.530
Come on, crappie.
I'm back in the market.

1:24:21.682 --> 1:24:23.976
- Got anything?
- Nothing. Get out.

1:24:26.103 --> 1:24:29.314
- I'm desperate. I'll do anything.
- Anything?

1:24:29.398 --> 1:24:32.734
Oh, god!

1:24:35.904 --> 1:24:38.031
- Anything?
- Yeah.

1:24:38.198 --> 1:24:40.492
I've got something to show you.

1:24:43.662 --> 1:24:44.871
What is it?

1:24:44.997 --> 1:24:47.499
It's a new mechanical
pipe and drain cleaner.

1:24:47.666 --> 1:24:50.419
- I'm starting a new service.
- Drains?

1:24:50.544 --> 1:24:51.864
- Yeah.
- Not with me, you're not.

1:24:51.920 --> 1:24:53.297
Here, hang about.

1:24:53.463 --> 1:24:56.133
I was thinking of putting you
in sole charge of this.

1:24:56.216 --> 1:24:58.176
Only 'cause you can't get anyone else.

1:24:58.302 --> 1:24:59.845
Yeah... no!

1:25:00.345 --> 1:25:02.598
Oh, look here. Look, somebody's
gotta do it, ain't they?

1:25:02.723 --> 1:25:05.934
It'll be a good rate of pay.
Plenty of overtime.

1:25:08.395 --> 1:25:10.314
- All right.
- Good boy.

1:25:10.439 --> 1:25:13.775
