00:09.110 --> 00:12.344
- Ooh. Love me
a good limbo.

00:12.346 --> 00:13.379
¶ How low can you go ¶

00:13.381 --> 00:15.080
¶ Unh! How low can you-- ¶

00:15.082 --> 00:17.416
Oh!
[groans]

00:18.719 --> 00:21.286
Why-y-y-y-y?

00:21.288 --> 00:21.987
- It's a bow staff.

00:21.989 --> 00:24.056
I'm training with it so I can
add it as one of my special

00:24.058 --> 00:25.758
skills to our Z Force
application.

00:25.760 --> 00:27.126
Wanna see some more moves?

00:27.128 --> 00:29.261
- No, no!
I like my bones.

00:31.432 --> 00:32.531
- Check it out.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.466
If we list enough amazing
talents on this baby,

00:34.468 --> 00:36.101
we'll stand out from
our competition.

00:36.103 --> 00:38.771
- Well, I was gonna give you
my list of special skills,

00:38.773 --> 00:42.741
you know, before you went all
Kung Fu Phoebe on me.

00:43.744 --> 00:45.511
- All right, let's see.

00:45.513 --> 00:48.380
Freeze breath, heat breath,
telekinesis.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.382
Max, we both have
these powers.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.284
Special skills are what
you bring to the Z Force

00:52.286 --> 00:53.352
that no one else does.

00:53.354 --> 00:56.588
- Well, then, put down
slow-motion arm farting.

00:56.590 --> 00:59.591
- [slow arm fart]

01:02.396 --> 01:05.230
- I will not.

01:05.232 --> 01:06.265
- Okay, fine.

01:06.267 --> 01:07.266
What did you put
on your list?

01:07.268 --> 01:09.168
- Well, uh, to name a few--
codebreaking,

01:09.170 --> 01:10.602
conversational Japanese,
power core, turkey calls,

01:10.604 --> 01:12.271
knot-tying, BASE jumping,
spelunking, accents,

01:12.273 --> 01:15.741
photographic memory,
and speed-talking.

01:15.743 --> 01:19.511
- Well, you didn't read the last
special skill on my list:

01:19.513 --> 01:20.779
inventing gadgets.

01:20.781 --> 01:22.748
- Ha! Yeah.

01:22.750 --> 01:25.651
Oh, you're serious?

01:25.653 --> 01:26.452
Come on, Max.

01:26.454 --> 01:28.287
Name of your gadgets
that didn't backfire.

01:28.289 --> 01:30.656
- The nosehairlizer.
- Gave Nora a beard.

01:30.658 --> 01:32.558
- The supervillain eye patch.
- Turned a child evil.

01:32.560 --> 01:35.427
- The brain meld.
- Speaks for itself.

01:35.429 --> 01:40.666
- Well, you haven't seen
my newest gadget.

01:40.668 --> 01:42.634
- A...brush?

01:43.771 --> 01:46.238
- It's not just
a brush, Phoebe.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.673
It's a gel brush.

01:47.675 --> 01:51.176
Hair gel and brush
together at last!

01:51.178 --> 01:54.313
- Wow. Can't wait to see how
this blows up in your face.

01:54.315 --> 01:56.849
- [gel squirting]
- Ugh! Ah!

01:56.851 --> 01:58.851
- Oh. Yeah. That's out.

01:58.853 --> 02:01.253
- [screaming]

02:01.255 --> 02:02.588
- [heavy thud]

02:02.590 --> 02:05.691
- ¶

02:05.693 --> 02:06.859
- HANK:
[groans]

02:06.861 --> 02:08.260
Barb, I keep getting
mean chirps

02:08.262 --> 02:10.195
from that guy on
my bowling league. Look.

02:10.197 --> 02:13.732
"You put the gut
in gutterball."

02:14.702 --> 02:16.869
- Why is someone sending
you mean chirps, Dad?

02:16.871 --> 02:19.938
- Ever since everyone found
out your dad's Thunder Man,

02:19.940 --> 02:21.874
this guy Nico is saying
he used his powers

02:21.876 --> 02:24.343
to win last year's
bowling championship.

02:24.345 --> 02:26.879
- [cell phone chirping]
- Butthead?

02:26.881 --> 02:30.182
No! You're the butthead!

02:30.184 --> 02:31.216
- Uh, Hank?

02:31.218 --> 02:32.684
Watch your language.

02:32.686 --> 02:35.287
- Butthead!
- BARB: Okay.

02:36.557 --> 02:37.022
- Sorry.

02:37.024 --> 02:39.725
It's just that I won this
trophy fair and square.

02:39.727 --> 02:41.760
And there's nothing
that two-faced magician

02:41.762 --> 02:43.762
can say to change that.

02:43.764 --> 02:46.365
- A magician?
Named Nico?

02:46.367 --> 02:48.634
As in the Amazing Nico?

02:48.636 --> 02:49.735
- He's our favorite.

02:49.737 --> 02:51.336
- Yeah, he's way better
than that magician

02:51.338 --> 02:55.474
you got for my birthday--
Good Enough Greg.

02:55.476 --> 02:58.844
- That guy made
the fun disappear.

02:59.780 --> 03:02.214
- Nico's big trick is that
he can walk through walls.

03:02.216 --> 03:06.451
- Whoop-di-do. I fly
through the ceiling every day.

03:06.453 --> 03:07.953
- Yeah, about that?

03:07.955 --> 03:09.922
Please stop.

03:10.491 --> 03:12.791
- Dad, can you take
us to meet Nico?

03:12.793 --> 03:13.559
- Absolutely not.

03:13.561 --> 03:15.794
- Guys, Dad's taking us
to meet the Amazing Nico!

03:15.796 --> 03:17.896
- No, no, no, no, no, no,
I didn't say that.

03:17.898 --> 03:20.399
- BILLY, NORA, CHLOE:
Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad!

03:20.401 --> 03:23.268
- Aw, that's so
sweet of you, Hank!

03:23.270 --> 03:25.804
- What just happened?

03:25.806 --> 03:27.940
- ¶

03:27.942 --> 03:29.675
- She says I stink
at gadgets?

03:29.677 --> 03:31.476
She's the one who stinks.

03:31.478 --> 03:32.844
- Yeah, she does.

03:32.846 --> 03:35.280
- I worked all night on this.

03:35.282 --> 03:35.981
- Yeah, you did.

03:35.983 --> 03:38.684
- Don't tell me I don't
have any special skills.

03:38.686 --> 03:41.820
- Okay, Mommy.
Love you, too.

03:41.822 --> 03:45.824
Oh, I'm sorry.
Were you talking to me?

03:45.826 --> 03:46.658
- Yes.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.527
I've been talking to you
for the past 12 hours

03:48.529 --> 03:51.630
while I've been working on
my most amazing project yet.

03:51.632 --> 03:53.999
- I ignored you
for 12 hours?

03:54.001 --> 03:55.734
I gotta call
and tell my mom.

03:55.736 --> 03:58.704
- Stop calling your mom!

03:58.706 --> 04:01.273
- PHOEBE:
[grunts]

04:01.275 --> 04:01.940
Like my new skill?

04:01.942 --> 04:04.710
- Annoying entrances?
That's not new.

04:04.712 --> 04:06.478
- Whatever. What'd you
wanna talk about?

04:06.480 --> 04:09.848
- Phoebe, what's the best
way to fight crime?

04:09.850 --> 04:11.583
- Well, the Hero League
manual says--

04:11.585 --> 04:13.385
- Wrong!
- Aah!

04:13.387 --> 04:17.289
- The best way is to stop
it before it happens.

04:17.291 --> 04:18.423
I give you...

04:18.425 --> 04:21.860
The crimecaster!
- [gadget beeping]

04:21.862 --> 04:25.330
- It's a gadget that crunches
years of crime statistics

04:25.332 --> 04:27.399
through a state-of-the-art
algorithm.

04:27.401 --> 04:29.968
Heh! Al-go-rithm!

04:30.838 --> 04:32.004
- Did you sleep last night?

04:32.006 --> 04:33.739
- No!
- Oh, okay.

04:33.741 --> 04:35.674
- Point is, it predicts
future crimes

04:35.676 --> 04:38.310
so we can use it to catch
criminals in the act.

04:38.312 --> 04:39.845
Heh. In the act!

04:39.847 --> 04:43.015
I'm sorry.
I really need a nap.

04:43.017 --> 04:45.617
- Wow, that gadget
sounds unbelievable...

04:45.619 --> 04:49.755
as in I am unable to
believe that it works.

04:49.757 --> 04:50.756
- [gadget beeping]

04:50.758 --> 04:53.692
- MAX's COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
It's crime time.

04:53.694 --> 04:56.728
- Looks like it's about
to prove you wrong.

04:56.730 --> 05:01.099
It says, "Hiddenville High
will be vandalized tonight."

05:01.101 --> 05:03.001
Unless we're there to stop it.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.636
- All right, fine, Max,
if this works,

05:04.638 --> 05:07.639
then we will put gadgets
on our Z Force application.

05:07.641 --> 05:08.940
- [clapping hands]

05:08.942 --> 05:13.045
- I know.
They never shut up.

05:13.047 --> 05:13.812
Hold on.

05:13.814 --> 05:17.516
Mom, I think they heard me.

05:17.518 --> 05:19.551

05:38.539 --> 05:40.405

05:55.923 --> 05:59.858
[suspenseful music]

06:00.194 --> 06:02.761
- Max, no one's vandalized
the school yet.

06:02.763 --> 06:03.929
We've been here all night.

06:03.931 --> 06:05.163
- Oh, that's your
newest skill?

06:05.165 --> 06:07.833
Telling me how long
you've been doing stuff?

06:07.835 --> 06:11.236
- Actually, no.
It's calligraphy.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.572
- "Max is bad at gadgets."

06:13.574 --> 06:14.639
Oh, that's nice.
Can I see it?

06:14.641 --> 06:17.943
- Sure.
- I am not bad at gadgets!

06:18.212 --> 06:21.046
- Face it, Max.
Your crimecaster's a dud.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.247
But don't worry.
We're still in good shape.

06:22.249 --> 06:24.282
I've got plenty of special
skills for the both of us.

06:24.284 --> 06:25.517
- What's that
supposed to mean?

06:25.519 --> 06:27.919
- It means our application
is loaded with great stuff.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.154
- Well, yeah,
with your stuff.

06:29.156 --> 06:31.857
- Max, it's our stuff.
We're a team.

06:31.859 --> 06:33.225
Now let's go home
and add pep talks

06:33.227 --> 06:35.727
to my list of
special skills.

06:38.899 --> 06:42.734
- Too bad throwing garbage
away isn't a skill.

06:42.736 --> 06:45.871
- [gadget thuds]
- Dang it.

06:46.106 --> 06:49.541
- [gadget thuds]
- Dang it!

06:49.743 --> 06:52.077

- Come on!

06:52.079 --> 06:55.580

06:55.582 --> 06:58.683
- Right, according to
Nico's Chirper account,

06:58.685 --> 07:00.218
he's here having lunch.

07:00.220 --> 07:03.255
- Oh, is that him?

07:03.791 --> 07:06.725
- No, it's just
Good Enough Greg.

07:06.727 --> 07:08.627
- Ta-da!

07:09.763 --> 07:12.264
- Never give up, Greg.

07:12.733 --> 07:15.567
- There's Amazing Nico.

07:15.569 --> 07:17.102
- Hey. Nico.

07:17.104 --> 07:17.969
- Oh, hello, Hank.

07:17.971 --> 07:20.672
- Yeah, listen, uh, my kids
wanted to meet you.

07:20.674 --> 07:22.240
They're huge fans...

07:22.242 --> 07:24.009
for some reason.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.710
- I love my fans.

07:25.712 --> 07:28.046
- Oh, my gosh.
He's looking at us.

07:28.048 --> 07:30.182
- I'm freaking out.

07:30.184 --> 07:32.150
- Stay cool, guys.

07:32.152 --> 07:36.888
- Anyway, uh, could you
please sign their pictures?

07:36.890 --> 07:38.023
- I already did.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.991
[hands whooshing]

07:39.993 --> 07:41.126
- NORA & BILLY:
Whoa!

07:41.128 --> 07:44.162
- Can you show us your trick
where you walk through a wall?

07:44.164 --> 07:45.997
- Anything for a fan.

07:45.999 --> 07:46.898
But not here.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.634
These walls don't
look very clean.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.369
- The walls at our
house are clean.

07:51.371 --> 07:53.038
You can come do
the trick there.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.172
- Oh, absolutely not.

07:54.174 --> 07:56.808
- Dad said Nico can come over!
- I didn't say that.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.877
- CHLOE, NORA, BILLY:
Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad!

07:58.879 --> 08:00.612
- That's so nice
of you, Hank.

08:00.614 --> 08:02.781
- Why can't anyone hear me?

08:02.783 --> 08:04.082
- I'll see you
tonight, kids.

08:04.084 --> 08:07.185
In the meantime,
have a burger on me.

08:07.187 --> 08:08.186
Or is it on you?

08:08.188 --> 08:09.821
[hands whooshing]

08:09.823 --> 08:12.123
- Awesome!
- Whoa!

08:12.125 --> 08:13.658
- Where's mine?

08:13.660 --> 08:15.393
- Open your hand.

08:15.395 --> 08:18.797
- Chicken nuggets?
You're amazing.

08:20.801 --> 08:23.802
- It's really nice of you
to put our differences aside

08:23.804 --> 08:24.803
and do this for my kids.

08:24.805 --> 08:27.038
- Oh, I'm not doing
this for your kids.

08:27.040 --> 08:30.108
I want that bowling
trophy, cheater.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.710
- No way.
I am not a cheater.

08:31.712 --> 08:33.211
- Well, you're about to
cheat your kids out of

08:33.213 --> 08:35.981
seeing the trick
"The Hiddenville Gazette"

08:35.983 --> 08:38.884
called "wall-to-wall fun."

08:43.156 --> 08:44.089
- Fine.

08:44.091 --> 08:46.091
The trophy for the trick.

08:46.093 --> 08:47.392
My address is--
- No need.

08:47.394 --> 08:49.828
I already got it--
from your wallet.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.263
[hands whooshing]

08:51.265 --> 08:54.099
By the way, you paid
for those burgers.

08:54.101 --> 08:55.901
Magic!

08:56.837 --> 09:00.305
- Yes, Mrs. Colosso, I give
him tummy tickles.

09:01.808 --> 09:03.775
Why are you making
me talk to her?

09:03.777 --> 09:05.110
- Five minutes out
of your day.

09:05.112 --> 09:08.346
That's all she asks for.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.248
- Hey. Max?

09:10.250 --> 09:10.982
I have good news.

09:10.984 --> 09:13.919
The school was horribly
vandalized last night.

09:14.388 --> 09:16.254
Well, technically
that's bad news.

09:16.256 --> 09:20.358
But the good news about the bad
news is your gadget works!

09:21.728 --> 09:22.994
- MAX:
"You've been vandalized"?

09:22.996 --> 09:27.399
Wow. Good thing I'm not the kind
of guy who says I told you so.

09:27.401 --> 09:28.733
But he is.

09:28.735 --> 09:29.868
- He told you so.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.903
- Thanks, buddy.

09:31.905 --> 09:32.470
- Well, hey.

09:32.472 --> 09:33.972
I've never been happier
to be wrong.

09:33.974 --> 09:35.774
Adding gadgets to your
list of special skills

09:35.776 --> 09:38.143
is really gonna turbocharge
our application.

09:38.145 --> 09:40.345
- Great. Thanks.

09:40.347 --> 09:41.146
- Congrats, Max.

09:41.148 --> 09:42.714
You're actually
pulling it off.

09:42.716 --> 09:46.751
- My highlights?
They look natural, right?

09:46.753 --> 09:47.252
- Uh, no.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.054
I mean not telling Phoebe
that you were the one

09:49.056 --> 09:50.755
who vandalized the school.

09:50.757 --> 09:53.391
- What would make
you think that?

09:53.393 --> 09:54.859
- I caught you red-handed.

09:54.861 --> 09:59.230
Seriously, there's red paint
all over your hands.

09:59.232 --> 10:01.032
- Fine, okay?
You got me.

10:01.034 --> 10:04.769
But...I just had to convince
Phoebe I'm good at gadgets.

10:04.771 --> 10:07.806
Don't want her to think I don't
bring anything to the team.

10:07.808 --> 10:08.807
- But isn't your dumb gadget

10:08.809 --> 10:10.909
gonna keep predicting crimes
that won't happen?

10:10.911 --> 10:13.044
- No, don't worry.
I took care of it.

10:13.046 --> 10:13.778
- [sighs] Hey, Max?

10:13.780 --> 10:15.280
I want to take a picture
of the crimecaster

10:15.282 --> 10:17.082
to include it in
our application.

10:17.084 --> 10:17.782
- We can't.

10:17.784 --> 10:22.787
I threw it out after you called
my beautiful creation a dud.

10:22.789 --> 10:25.056
- Well, could you just make
another crimecaster?

10:25.058 --> 10:27.926
- Impossible.
It was one of a kind.

10:27.928 --> 10:29.094
And I burned all my notes

10:29.096 --> 10:31.129
after you called
my beautiful creation--

10:31.131 --> 10:33.231
- A dud. I get it.

10:34.768 --> 10:36.901
- It's just sad, really,
that the crimecaster

10:36.903 --> 10:41.339
didn't predict the crime of
you not believing in me...

10:41.508 --> 10:45.477
because now it's at the bottom
of the Hiddenville dump,

10:45.479 --> 10:47.879
never to be found again.

10:49.216 --> 10:51.449
- I found it!

10:54.521 --> 10:57.322
- That's amazing.

10:58.091 --> 11:02.394
- [gadget beeping]
- MAX's VOICE: It's crime time.

11:02.396 --> 11:06.097
- And it still works!
- No!

11:06.099 --> 11:08.066
Way!

11:09.936 --> 11:12.370
- It says there's gonna be
a delivery of smuggled gold

11:12.372 --> 11:14.806
at a fish warehouse
downtown tonight.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.274
We're gonna be there
to stop it.

11:16.276 --> 11:19.144
- Or we can call
the fish police.

11:19.146 --> 11:21.146
That's a thing, right?

11:21.148 --> 11:22.280
- Max, this is our bust.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.249
We're gonna take those
smugglers down.

11:24.251 --> 11:26.384
Uh, the Z Force is gonna
freak when they see

11:26.386 --> 11:28.820
how good your gadget is.

11:29.489 --> 11:30.121
- [sighs]

11:30.123 --> 11:33.525
Phoebe's gonna freak when
she finds out I lied to her.

11:33.527 --> 11:34.959
She's never gonna
trust me again.

11:34.961 --> 11:37.829
- Unless we make sure
she doesn't find out.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.864
And I know just
how to do it.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.299
- Yeah, I hear what
you're saying.

11:41.301 --> 11:44.269
We fake the gold heist
and Phoebe never suspects

11:44.271 --> 11:45.537
the crimecaster doesn't work.

11:45.539 --> 11:48.873
- I was gonna say blast
her into space.

11:48.875 --> 11:51.910
- Why is that your
plan for everything?

11:56.316 --> 11:59.117
- [suspenseful music]

11:59.119 --> 12:03.855
¶

12:03.857 --> 12:06.458
- Okay. According to
my crimecaster,

12:06.460 --> 12:08.426
the bad guys should
be here any minute.

12:08.428 --> 12:09.461
- This is so exciting, Max.

12:09.463 --> 12:12.197
Your machine is gonna change
crime-fighting as we know it.

12:12.199 --> 12:13.898
Oh, um, one question.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.067
What's on my face?

12:16.069 --> 12:16.935
- It's a beard.

12:16.937 --> 12:19.104
We have to blend in
as dock workers.

12:19.106 --> 12:21.172
Now, wear some of this
tuna cologne.

12:21.174 --> 12:24.109
- [spritzing cologne]
- PHOEBE: [coughing]

12:24.111 --> 12:25.810
- I'll scout the perimeter.

12:25.812 --> 12:28.113
- Cool. I'll go throw up.

12:33.186 --> 12:35.787
- Colosso,
is everything set up?

12:35.789 --> 12:36.254
- Aye!

12:36.256 --> 12:39.290
Phoebe will be shiverin'
her timbers when she thinks

12:39.292 --> 12:43.795
the bad guys are here to
nab the smuggled booty.

12:43.797 --> 12:45.797
- You're supposed to be a dock
worker, not a pirate.

12:45.799 --> 12:48.166
- And you're supposed to
be good at gadgets.

12:48.168 --> 12:53.171
Now, to set the mood with
some soothing dock sounds.

12:53.173 --> 12:56.474
- [whale calls]
- Whale noises?

12:56.476 --> 13:00.478
- Aye! The elephants
of the deep.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.247
- Would you turn
that thing off?

13:02.249 --> 13:03.181
This has to work.

13:03.183 --> 13:04.983
Phoebe cannot find out
I lied to her.

13:04.985 --> 13:09.020
- She won't--thanks to
Captain Colosso.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.088
But best be ready.

13:10.090 --> 13:15.360
A couple of scallywags
are about to ent-arrrgh!

13:15.362 --> 13:17.061
- [door creaking
sound effect]

13:17.063 --> 13:18.830
- COLOSSO: [deep voice]
Time to get that gold.

13:18.832 --> 13:20.532
- PHOEBE: Max, I just
heard the crooks.

13:20.534 --> 13:22.534
- She's fallen for it.

13:24.271 --> 13:26.137
- Hey, I'm gonna
go investigate.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.839
- No, let's just
keep listening

13:27.841 --> 13:29.340
and hope they don't
find a secret way out

13:29.342 --> 13:32.343
that'll prevent us from
seeing or catching them.

13:35.081 --> 13:35.880
- [computer beeping]

13:35.882 --> 13:37.282
- FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Alert! Alert!

13:37.284 --> 13:39.184
The Amazing Nico approaching.

13:39.186 --> 13:40.084
- He's not that amazing.

13:40.086 --> 13:41.419
- COMPUTER VOICE:
"The Hiddenville Gazette"

13:41.421 --> 13:44.389
called him--
- Don't make me buy a doorbell!

13:44.558 --> 13:47.926
- He's here! He's here!
He's here!

13:50.564 --> 13:51.896
Where is he?

13:51.898 --> 13:53.565
- I'm right here.

13:53.567 --> 13:55.500
Magic!

13:55.502 --> 13:57.902
- BILLY, CHLOE, NORA:
Wow!

13:57.904 --> 14:00.171
- Thanks for having
me for dinner.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.439
I hope you like flowers.

14:01.441 --> 14:02.307
[hands whooshing]

14:02.309 --> 14:04.309
- Oh, thanks!
They're beautiful.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.110
[sniffing]
And they smell so nice.

14:06.112 --> 14:09.147
- All right, we've all
seen flowers.

14:09.149 --> 14:14.185
- So, kids, are you ready to see
me walk through a wall?

14:14.187 --> 14:15.420
- BILLY, CHLOE, NORA:
Yay!

14:15.422 --> 14:17.522
- Pick a wall while
I handle some business

14:17.524 --> 14:20.191
with your father first.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.062
- There's so many walls.

14:24.064 --> 14:25.230
- Which one do we pick?

14:25.232 --> 14:28.633
- I can't take
the pressure!

14:28.635 --> 14:29.968
- This is too important.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.469
I'd better go ask him.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.538
- Quit stalling.
We made a deal.

14:33.540 --> 14:37.508
You give me the trophy.
I walk through a wall.

14:37.510 --> 14:38.176
- Fine.

14:38.178 --> 14:41.079
Even though I won it fair and
square, I'll give it to you.

14:41.081 --> 14:42.480
All I want is to make
my kids happy.

14:42.482 --> 14:45.450
- [imitating] All I want
is to make my kids happy.

14:46.486 --> 14:49.587
- Guys, Dad's giving Nico
his trophy for this.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.256
- He loves that trophy.

14:51.258 --> 14:52.123
He'll be heartbroken.

14:52.125 --> 14:54.092
- There's only one thing that
can make Dad feel better.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.227
- Watching Nico walk
through a wall?

14:56.229 --> 14:57.228
- Yup.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.998
- Bring on the magic, baby!

15:02.402 --> 15:05.637
- COLOSSO: [deep voice]
Now it's time to get that gold.

15:05.639 --> 15:10.241
Look for the crate
that says, uh, "gold."

15:10.243 --> 15:13.611
- Why would they write "gold"
on a crate full of stolen gold?

15:13.613 --> 15:16.281
- Well, maybe they had very
little time to put this

15:16.283 --> 15:19.717
all together and they're just
doing the best they can.

15:19.719 --> 15:23.288
- Okay, um, let's check
these crates for gold.

15:23.657 --> 15:26.591
- [cell phone rings]
- COLOSSO: Mom?

15:26.593 --> 15:28.493
Yeah, it's going great.

15:28.495 --> 15:30.995
Me and Max are
tricking Phoebe.

15:30.997 --> 15:34.065
She's so dumb.

15:34.067 --> 15:36.267
- [powers whooshing]

15:36.269 --> 15:38.002
- Colosso?

15:38.004 --> 15:40.271
- [deep voice] Uh...
pay no attention to

15:40.273 --> 15:42.740
the bunny behind
the curtain.

15:42.742 --> 15:46.611
- Okay, why would you and
Colosso fake this whole crime?

15:46.613 --> 15:48.146
I mean, unless--
[gasps]

15:48.148 --> 15:50.982
--the crimecaster
doesn't work!

15:50.984 --> 15:52.050
- How dare you.

15:52.052 --> 15:55.486
- Oh, just stop, Max.
I caught you red-handed.

15:55.488 --> 15:56.421
- For your information,

15:56.423 --> 15:58.156
this was from when
I vandalized the school.

15:58.158 --> 16:02.260
- [scoffs] So you've been
lying to me this whole time?

16:05.732 --> 16:09.033
- Hey, who are these guys?

16:09.035 --> 16:09.667
- Doesn't matter.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.703
We're gonna have to
get rid of 'em.

16:11.705 --> 16:13.571
- Let me guess, Max,
you hired these two goons

16:13.573 --> 16:16.040
to make it look like a real
crime was happening?

16:16.042 --> 16:18.543
- No, I've never seen those
two before in my life.

16:18.545 --> 16:21.346
Colosso, tell her.

16:21.348 --> 16:22.413
Traitor!

16:22.415 --> 16:24.716
- Where did you even
find these losers?

16:24.718 --> 16:26.684
I mean, look at their
stupid costumes.

16:26.686 --> 16:29.287
- Phoebe, don't!
- Hey!

16:29.289 --> 16:32.056
- Wow, his fake beard
is worse than yours.

16:32.058 --> 16:34.058
Ha!
- Ow.

16:34.060 --> 16:37.195
- This is actually
pretty good.

16:37.197 --> 16:40.031
- That's because
these guys are--

16:40.033 --> 16:42.233
- [heavy thud]
- MAX & PHOEBE: [groan]

16:42.235 --> 16:46.137
- --real criminals.
- Yes, I see that now.

16:47.207 --> 16:50.475
- ¶

16:50.477 --> 16:54.145
- Time to hand over
the trophy...cheater.

16:54.814 --> 16:57.048
- You're more than
just a trophy.

16:57.050 --> 17:00.585
You were my reason to
wake up every morning.

17:00.587 --> 17:02.754
[kisses trophy]

17:02.756 --> 17:04.222
- I'm gonna let
that one slide

17:04.224 --> 17:07.325
because I know you're
hurting right now.

17:09.062 --> 17:11.496
- [sobbing]

17:11.498 --> 17:15.099
- This whole thing's starting
to make me feel bad.

17:15.101 --> 17:16.234
- Me, too.

17:16.236 --> 17:17.402
- I feel hungry.

17:17.404 --> 17:21.339
And, you know,
bad for Dad.

17:21.341 --> 17:22.240
- So we agree.

17:22.242 --> 17:24.375
Just because Dad would
do anything for us

17:24.377 --> 17:25.443
doesn't mean
we should let him.

17:25.445 --> 17:28.246
- And now I will ask
permission from the wall

17:28.248 --> 17:29.814
to allow me to
pass through it.

17:29.816 --> 17:34.252
¶ Ooh, wally-wally-wally-
wally-wally-wally-wally-wally ¶

17:34.254 --> 17:36.154
- Nico, stop!
- Why?

17:36.156 --> 17:40.858
- Because we're taking
back our dad's trophy.

17:43.163 --> 17:47.532
I want to stop, but I have
to see how this ends.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.534
- Looking for this?

17:49.536 --> 17:50.601
Hey! No! Hey!

17:50.603 --> 17:52.403
- Give it back!
- Hand it over!

17:52.405 --> 17:54.572
- It's mine!
- Kids, it's okay.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.641
If he wants it so bad,
just let him have it.

17:56.643 --> 17:59.310
- Listen to your father.
Just let go.

17:59.312 --> 18:02.613
- NORA: She's right.
We should just let go.

18:02.615 --> 18:03.815
- NICO:
Whoa!

18:03.817 --> 18:06.617
- [plaster shatters]

18:06.619 --> 18:08.820
- Again! Again!

18:08.822 --> 18:10.755
- Hey, Dad got his
trophy back

18:10.757 --> 18:13.624
and we saw Nico go
through the wall.

18:13.626 --> 18:14.625
- Here you go, Dad.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.694
- Oh, thanks, kids. Oh...

18:16.696 --> 18:20.832
- [groans] It's too bad
I don't have an ice pack.

18:20.834 --> 18:23.301
Or do I?
[hands whooshing]

18:23.303 --> 18:27.538
Oh! Oh!
- [heavy thud]

18:27.540 --> 18:31.676
- ¶

18:31.678 --> 18:33.244
- [handcuffs clanging]

18:33.246 --> 18:34.612
- PHOEBE: [grunts]
[sighs]

18:34.614 --> 18:36.647
- Just had to go digging
around the dump

18:36.649 --> 18:39.417
to find my crimecaster,
didn't you?

18:39.419 --> 18:41.719
- Oh, so this is my fault?

18:41.721 --> 18:44.188
- I'm glad you're saying it.

18:44.190 --> 18:45.456
- Hey, I don't get it.

18:45.458 --> 18:46.924
Why did you try to
trick me into thinking

18:46.926 --> 18:47.725
the crimecaster worked?

18:47.727 --> 18:50.862
- So we could put gadgets on
our Z Force application.

18:50.864 --> 18:51.729
- I already told you--

18:51.731 --> 18:53.731
I have enough special skills
for the both of us.

18:53.733 --> 18:56.467
- Phoebe, I don't want
to get into the Z Force

18:56.469 --> 18:57.602
because you're great.

18:57.604 --> 19:00.705
I want to get in because
we're both great.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.507
Even if it's not true.

19:02.509 --> 19:07.211
- Found some yellow bricks,
Boss, but no gold.

19:07.213 --> 19:10.882
- That's gold, you idiot.

19:10.884 --> 19:12.650
- They're smuggling gold?

19:12.652 --> 19:13.885
- That means your
crimecaster works!

19:13.887 --> 19:16.187
- But it was wrong about
the school being vandalized.

19:16.189 --> 19:19.190
- What? Max,
it was vandalized--

19:19.192 --> 19:20.958
by you.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.860
- You're right.

19:22.862 --> 19:25.730
My beautiful creation works!

19:25.732 --> 19:28.866
I can't wait to show
it to the world.

19:28.868 --> 19:29.901
- [gadget beeping]

19:29.903 --> 19:31.903
- Stop looking at
me, weird machine.

19:31.905 --> 19:33.437
- [gadget beeping]
- [roaring]

19:33.439 --> 19:36.774
- [glass shatters]
- Crimecaster! No!

19:36.776 --> 19:39.877
- Hey, at least now we know
you're good at gadgets.

19:39.879 --> 19:42.813
I just wish we had one
to get us out of this.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.248
- Wait.

19:44.250 --> 19:45.650
Phoebe, I do.

19:45.652 --> 19:47.785
[powers whooshing]

19:47.787 --> 19:48.953
My gel brush.

19:48.955 --> 19:50.688
- What? Are you gonna
brush his beard?

19:50.690 --> 19:54.225
He really doesn't like
people touching it.

19:54.227 --> 19:54.959
- No, watch.

19:54.961 --> 19:56.928
- [gel squishing]

19:56.930 --> 20:02.600
- ¶

20:02.602 --> 20:04.502
- Yes, I am the king
of gadgets!

20:04.504 --> 20:06.537
- Could you be the duke
of quieting down?

20:06.539 --> 20:07.805
- Hey! They got loose.

20:07.807 --> 20:08.773
- Should we get 'em?

20:08.775 --> 20:10.641
- No, we should let
'em walk way.

20:10.643 --> 20:12.643
Yes, we should get 'em!

20:13.913 --> 20:16.414
- Time to test out
my special skill.

20:16.416 --> 20:20.685
- ¶

20:20.687 --> 20:21.819
- Ah!

20:21.821 --> 20:23.287
Hey, tiny?

20:23.289 --> 20:24.956
Let's dance!

20:24.958 --> 20:26.290
- Is that a limbo stick?

20:26.292 --> 20:28.859
- It's a bow staff!

20:28.861 --> 20:31.796
[grunts of effort]

20:31.798 --> 20:41.439
- ¶

20:41.441 --> 20:42.373
- Looks like
it's you and me.

20:42.375 --> 20:44.709
- I'm gonna slap those
highlights right off your head.

20:44.711 --> 20:48.446
Yeah, that's right.
You're not fooling anybody.

20:48.448 --> 20:50.615

21:06.866 --> 21:08.466
- I don't got all day, man.

21:08.468 --> 21:10.334
[spritzes gel]
- Uh!

21:10.336 --> 21:12.336
[coughing]

21:12.338 --> 21:13.571
- Stinks, huh?

21:13.573 --> 21:15.740
Smell the bottom of my foot.

21:15.742 --> 21:17.742
- [heavy thud]

21:17.744 --> 21:25.416
- ¶

21:28.354 --> 21:29.353
- Good job, Phoebe.

21:29.355 --> 21:30.888
Looks like your new
skill paid off.

21:30.890 --> 21:32.690
- Hey, the crimecaster
paid off--

21:32.692 --> 21:35.926
which is why we are putting
gadgets on our application.

21:35.928 --> 21:39.397
- [laughs]
I am the king of gadgets!

21:39.399 --> 21:42.400
- [car engine revving]

21:43.036 --> 21:46.437
- I got the gold, Ma!
We're gonna be rich!

21:46.439 --> 21:47.805

- [chain snaps]

21:54.881 --> 21:56.047
- COLOSSO:
Max!

21:56.049 --> 21:59.850
Can you call
a tiny ambulance?

22:00.720 --> 22:02.520
- So anyway, the application's
gonna be great.

22:02.522 --> 22:04.922
- Yeah, I feel really
good about it.
