01:33.082 --> 01:34.681
Where do you want to begin?

01:36.117 --> 01:37.183
<i>Dustpan...</i>

01:37.185 --> 01:38.250
<i>Spoon...</i>

01:38.385 --> 01:39.450
<i>Noodles...</i>

01:40.519 --> 01:41.584
<i>Bear...</i>

01:44.121 --> 01:45.186
<i>Frying pan...</i>

01:46.489 --> 01:48.655
<i>Fire. Apollo Ape. "Marry Me."</i>

01:53.495 --> 01:55.995
<i>Where did it all begin?</i>

02:22.222 --> 02:25.224
<i>Okay, it started
three days ago.</i>

02:25.226 --> 02:27.146
<i>In the town of Liman,
West Virginia.</i>

02:36.236 --> 02:38.370
<i>It's where I lived
with my girlfriend, Phoebe.</i>

02:42.676 --> 02:45.243
<i>She is the only good thing
that's ever happened to me.</i>

02:46.479 --> 02:51.082
<i>I honestly cannot even
remember my life before her.</i>

02:53.119 --> 02:55.586
<i>We were the perfect
fucked-up couple.</i>

02:56.255 --> 02:59.388
<i>She was perfect,
and I was the fuck-up.</i>

03:01.359 --> 03:03.692
<i>And we were really,
really happy.</i>

03:05.128 --> 03:06.594
<i>And I wanted
to make it forever,</i>

03:06.596 --> 03:09.029
<i>so I saved up
for the perfect ring.</i>

03:10.332 --> 03:13.567
<i>And I planned the perfect
romantic trip to surprise her.</i>

03:16.305 --> 03:18.271
<i>And then I fucked
that up, too.</i>

03:18.273 --> 03:19.572
<i>This is
the final boarding call</i>

03:19.574 --> 03:21.040
<i>for Flight 1204,</i>

03:21.342 --> 03:24.009
<i>departing for Oahu, Hawaii.</i>

03:24.011 --> 03:25.344
<i>I repeat,</i>

03:25.346 --> 03:28.413
<i>this is the final
boarding call for Flight 1204,</i>

03:28.415 --> 03:30.335
<i>departing for Oahu, Hawaii.</i>

03:30.683 --> 03:33.583
<i>Now boarding
all rows and all zones.</i>

03:33.585 --> 03:36.252
<i>All passengers should be
onboard at this time.</i>

03:39.557 --> 03:41.723
God damn it, Mike, come on.

03:41.725 --> 03:44.559
<i>All passengers
please proceed to the gate.</i>

03:51.234 --> 03:52.433
I really am sorry, Phoebe.

03:52.435 --> 03:56.236
I really thought I could beat
the panic attacks this time.

03:56.238 --> 03:57.403
It's okay.

03:57.405 --> 03:59.671
- It's not.
- No, it's fine.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.340
No, it's not fine.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.076
This is something
I really wanted to do for you.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.578
Then I ruined it
and now we're going back home.

04:08.047 --> 04:10.614
- You didn't ruin this.
- Yes, I did. It's my fault.

04:10.616 --> 04:12.082
You should be mad at me...

04:12.084 --> 04:13.525
- No.
- Why not?

04:15.321 --> 04:18.120
- You can't help it, Mike...
- Okay. Thanks.

04:18.123 --> 04:20.322
Oh, shit.

04:21.125 --> 04:22.290
Jesus.

04:22.558 --> 04:23.790
Are you holding?

04:23.792 --> 04:25.592
No, of course not.
We were going on a plane.

04:25.594 --> 04:26.759
Why would I...

04:27.762 --> 04:29.128
You holding?

04:31.065 --> 04:33.198
Yeah. Sorry.

04:48.414 --> 04:49.935
- Hi, Phoebe.
- Hey.

04:50.683 --> 04:53.350
- Hi, Mike.
- Hey.

04:53.485 --> 04:56.085
Heard you two
were going on vacation.

04:56.587 --> 04:58.253
Hawaii.

04:59.756 --> 05:02.390
Get another one of your
little episodes there, Mike?

05:03.693 --> 05:04.825
You know, Phoebe.

05:05.160 --> 05:07.160
I once had to drive
your boy home

05:07.162 --> 05:08.394
'cause he was
having one of them

05:08.396 --> 05:10.396
panic attacks
up on the freeway,

05:10.398 --> 05:11.697
trying to leave town.

05:11.699 --> 05:14.467
Is there a reason
that you pulled us over?

05:14.469 --> 05:17.303
Hey, easy on the tone,
Miss Larson.

05:17.672 --> 05:19.552
I'd hate to have
to search this car.

05:19.706 --> 05:21.505
It's getting to the point
where your boyfriend

05:21.507 --> 05:23.340
should start
leaving a toothbrush

05:23.342 --> 05:25.309
at the overnight
down at the station.

05:25.878 --> 05:27.677
Ain't that right, Mike?

05:27.679 --> 05:29.578
That's right, Sheriff Watts.

05:31.214 --> 05:33.413
Well, just wanted to
welcome you back to town.

05:53.235 --> 05:54.334
I'll get the bags.

06:10.551 --> 06:12.431
Hey, Phoebe,
do you want an omelet?

06:48.424 --> 06:50.557
This could be
the right moment.

07:00.903 --> 07:01.968
Hey, Mikey?

07:04.638 --> 07:07.238
Is this okay? I think this...

07:07.607 --> 07:08.739
Ow!

07:08.741 --> 07:09.806
Oh!

07:12.477 --> 07:13.542
What the fuck!

07:13.544 --> 07:14.809
Oh, Phoebe, oh, no, I'm sorry.

07:14.811 --> 07:16.677
Oh, did you burn your hand?

07:16.679 --> 07:18.512
Just let me
do the cooking, okay?

07:18.514 --> 07:20.847
- I will. I'm sorry.
- Stop apologizing.

07:21.449 --> 07:22.514
Okay.

08:27.318 --> 08:28.450
Apollo Ape...

08:28.452 --> 08:29.517
Pow!

08:29.819 --> 08:30.884
I got you.

08:35.457 --> 08:37.298
No, what do you think
you're doing?

08:38.760 --> 08:40.626
Hey, honey, no,
I just wanted to tell you

08:40.628 --> 08:42.727
I had, like, a really
funny idea for Apollo Ape.

08:42.730 --> 08:44.770
<i>That's cool, what is it?</i>

09:46.796 --> 09:49.130
How the fuck am I
supposed to read this?

09:51.632 --> 09:53.398
Hey. Hello there.

09:53.733 --> 09:55.365
You're here late, Lasseter.

09:55.367 --> 09:56.699
You're not my
assistant anymore, Petey.

09:56.701 --> 09:58.000
What are you doing down here?

09:58.002 --> 09:59.701
I know, I just miss ya.

09:59.703 --> 10:01.503
Oh, come on, you're not
at the big desk anymore,

10:01.505 --> 10:02.904
you can let
a few things slide.

10:03.106 --> 10:04.772
Enough, Agent Douglas.

10:08.744 --> 10:09.943
Oh, okay, I'm leaving.
Do you need anything

10:09.945 --> 10:11.978
before I...

10:29.496 --> 10:30.679
Lasseter.

10:30.680 --> 10:31.863
<i>The Ultra Program Toughguy</i>

10:31.865 --> 10:32.964
<i>is active.</i>

10:32.966 --> 10:34.966
<i>Wiseman asset Howell
is the target.</i>

10:34.968 --> 10:36.402
What?

10:36.403 --> 10:37.836
<i>He'll be eliminated
within 24 hours.</i>

10:37.838 --> 10:39.904
This is American soil,
they can't do that.

10:40.139 --> 10:43.707
We promised to protect him.
Who is it? Yates?

10:43.709 --> 10:45.475
<i>The operation is in progress.</i>

10:45.477 --> 10:47.410
<i>You're being informed
as a courtesy.</i>

10:47.412 --> 10:48.963
Who is this?

10:48.964 --> 10:50.924
<i>Do not interfere.
Have a nice evening.</i>

10:52.017 --> 10:53.883
So Apollo Ape
and Chip the Brick are, like,

10:53.885 --> 10:55.651
"Hey, what the heck
happened?" You know?

10:55.653 --> 10:57.353
And then they find out

10:57.354 --> 10:59.054
that Spicy Tomato was
in charge of the resistance.

10:59.056 --> 11:00.990
Okay, but what they
didn't find out,

11:00.992 --> 11:02.424
which they'll find out
in the next book,

11:02.426 --> 11:05.193
is that Fido Astro
is also in on it.

11:07.764 --> 11:10.164
Oh, no. Dude.

11:10.166 --> 11:11.431
I know.

11:11.633 --> 11:14.201
I feel so betrayed.

11:14.203 --> 11:15.569
Do you get it?
It's because

11:15.570 --> 11:16.936
he's man's best friend,
not monkey's best friend.

11:16.939 --> 11:18.272
Of course.
I mean, in hindsight

11:18.273 --> 11:19.606
it makes total sense to me.
It's just that...

11:19.608 --> 11:20.807
He's a dog.

11:22.744 --> 11:24.177
You should write it down,
I'm telling you.

11:24.179 --> 11:26.612
I don't know, I mean, I really
just like thinking about it

11:26.614 --> 11:28.447
and like talking about it.

11:29.049 --> 11:31.149
Apollo Ape and his adventures.

11:31.151 --> 11:32.750
No, I love when you
talk about it.

11:32.885 --> 11:34.517
I think other people
would love it, too.

11:34.519 --> 11:35.985
Like, even...

11:36.555 --> 11:37.887
Like they might love
to read it

11:37.889 --> 11:39.221
if you wrote it down,
seriously.

11:40.824 --> 11:42.664
Do something
really real with it.

11:47.797 --> 11:49.798
You know what
skives me out, Pheebs?

11:50.633 --> 11:51.698
What?

11:51.700 --> 11:55.835
That car down there
has moved so much.

11:57.038 --> 11:58.737
Like it was built
in a factory,

11:58.739 --> 12:00.139
on a production line.

12:00.474 --> 12:03.475
And then it was like
shipped, like, here.

12:03.477 --> 12:05.477
And then, like, this guy
drove it all over the place.

12:05.479 --> 12:06.945
Yeah, exactly.

12:08.014 --> 12:09.880
But all that time,
like for years,

12:09.882 --> 12:12.783
or really for, like,
decades really,

12:12.785 --> 12:14.851
this one tree has been
sitting in this one place

12:14.853 --> 12:16.485
not doing anything
until tonight,

12:16.487 --> 12:18.920
when it, like,
stopped the car.

12:21.724 --> 12:22.823
Yeah?

12:22.825 --> 12:24.666
Okay, so this car
is always going.

12:25.561 --> 12:30.263
And that tree is always just,
like, stopping. You know?

12:30.265 --> 12:32.698
Like, it's been
stopping there for years

12:32.700 --> 12:34.099
until tonight
when it met something

12:34.101 --> 12:35.767
that it didn't want to
keep going,

12:35.769 --> 12:37.669
and it was like, "Mmm-mmm. No.

12:42.609 --> 12:43.708
"You're stopping, too."

12:43.709 --> 12:44.808
And then this tree
that has never done anything,

12:44.811 --> 12:45.943
is fucking, like...

12:45.945 --> 12:48.947
Like,
destroying this beautiful...

12:48.949 --> 12:51.182
Like, really beautiful
and fast-moving thing.

12:52.652 --> 12:54.752
Why? Why are you crying?

12:54.754 --> 12:56.086
Because, Phoebe, like...

12:58.056 --> 12:59.221
Am I that tree?

13:01.793 --> 13:02.925
No.

13:04.161 --> 13:05.226
No.

13:05.728 --> 13:07.648
I think I'm that tree.
And I think...

13:07.896 --> 13:10.096
I think you're the car.
And I think I'm stopping you.

13:10.631 --> 13:12.698
- You are not the tree.
- Okay.

13:13.600 --> 13:14.665
I love you.

13:21.773 --> 13:25.842
Phoebe, I really am sorry
about Hawaii.

13:30.114 --> 13:32.180
It's okay, honestly.

13:34.684 --> 13:37.819
I totally over-reacted.
I was really upset.

13:42.625 --> 13:45.258
It's not going to be
like this always, you know.

13:47.228 --> 13:49.028
Mike, you're like...

13:50.064 --> 13:51.863
...the strongest,
kindest person

13:51.865 --> 13:53.625
I've ever met
in my whole life.

13:54.667 --> 13:55.966
I fucking love you.

14:11.216 --> 14:13.817
- You're a fucking mess, man.
- I know.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.820
- Yates!
- Oh, for Christ's sake.

14:52.090 --> 14:53.189
Yes, Victoria?

14:53.191 --> 14:55.031
I need to speak
with you right now.

14:56.760 --> 14:59.293
Okay, I guess we were
pretty much done here.

14:59.295 --> 15:00.795
Thanks, guys.

15:03.232 --> 15:04.731
Stop avoiding me.

15:05.366 --> 15:07.199
I've got word that Toughguy
is moving in

15:07.201 --> 15:09.634
on my old Wiseman asset.
What is Toughguy?

15:10.003 --> 15:12.004
- And where did you hear that?
- Is it true?

15:14.240 --> 15:16.740
It doesn't concern you. Okay?

15:17.242 --> 15:19.008
Wiseman was my baby.

15:19.010 --> 15:21.377
Yeah, and it's still-born.
So, what are you crying about?

15:21.379 --> 15:23.812
So you're coming after
my still-born baby?

15:25.683 --> 15:27.749
Let's finish this
in my office.

15:28.718 --> 15:30.718
I don't understand why
you're so upset here.

15:30.720 --> 15:32.319
Aren't you the one
who shut down the program?

15:32.321 --> 15:34.087
Yeah, because it was
a flawed model.

15:34.089 --> 15:35.922
Because we were
hurting people.

15:35.924 --> 15:37.925
I didn't expect your
yuppie ass to come riding in

15:37.927 --> 15:39.960
on a vulture and pick
at the bones of my operation.

15:39.962 --> 15:42.195
I was made supervisor
fair and square.

15:42.330 --> 15:43.696
You were made
a temporary supervisor

15:43.698 --> 15:44.930
because you kissed
the right asses.

15:44.932 --> 15:46.364
Because I'm the right man
for the job.

15:46.366 --> 15:48.367
According to who? Daffy Duck?

15:49.670 --> 15:51.270
Daffy Duck...

15:51.271 --> 15:52.871
Well, I guess I'm doing
something right

15:52.873 --> 15:54.272
because I've had the job
for about two years.

15:54.274 --> 15:56.057
Yeah, it should have
been two months.

15:56.058 --> 15:57.841
You're supposed to protect
these assets. Not kill them!

15:57.844 --> 15:59.743
Victoria, we're clearing
the portfolio.

15:59.745 --> 16:00.845
What?

16:00.847 --> 16:02.112
Mike Howell keeps trying
to leave town.

16:02.114 --> 16:03.446
He needs to be eliminated.

16:04.449 --> 16:06.849
You're going to kill him
for trying to leave town?

16:06.851 --> 16:08.750
That's a security breach.
I'm just doing my job.

16:08.752 --> 16:10.402
He's a human being.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.054
- They're assets.
- He's an American citizen.

16:12.056 --> 16:13.288
They're government property.

16:13.290 --> 16:14.922
Are you actually
fucking insane?

16:14.924 --> 16:16.223
Oh, language.

16:16.225 --> 16:17.857
Listen to me, King Idiot!

16:17.859 --> 16:19.659
If you think
I'm just going to sit back...

16:19.660 --> 16:21.460
No, you listen to me,
you snipey overbearing bitch!

16:21.462 --> 16:23.862
Howell dies today!

16:23.864 --> 16:26.298
Yeah. And you can't do shit.
What are you going to do?

16:26.700 --> 16:28.800
Huh? You going to go over me?

16:28.802 --> 16:31.002
You're my
fucking dog here, okay?

16:31.437 --> 16:34.404
Sit. Stay. Behave.

16:35.240 --> 16:39.309
Now get the fuck
out of my fucking office!

16:52.721 --> 16:54.253
Mike, what's happening?

16:55.389 --> 16:57.288
Oh. Um...

16:57.290 --> 17:00.991
Nothing. Just, uh, something.
I have to go to work.

17:01.793 --> 17:03.392
Isn't it early?

17:04.428 --> 17:08.462
Yeah. Yeah. But, um,
they needed me to do a thing.

17:09.164 --> 17:10.229
What thing?

17:11.131 --> 17:12.196
Groceries.

17:16.769 --> 17:17.901
I love you.

17:44.527 --> 17:46.326

17:46.328 --> 17:47.527
- How's it goin', man?
- How you doin', baby?

17:47.529 --> 17:49.062
What's up!

17:49.064 --> 17:50.904
I really appreciate
you doing this for me, man.

17:50.931 --> 17:53.531
Come on, man. Come on, baby,

17:53.533 --> 17:54.866

All right. Yeah.

17:57.536 --> 17:58.869
All right, right.
Now go open up your trunk.

17:59.271 --> 18:00.838
- Oh, okay, all right.

18:00.840 --> 18:02.372
Casual like, no big D.

18:05.543 --> 18:06.709
Stay chill.

18:06.710 --> 18:08.630
You ready?
Come on, come on, come on.

18:16.885 --> 18:18.351

18:18.353 --> 18:20.086
This is some fucking
powerful fireworks, man.

18:22.023 --> 18:23.122

18:24.959 --> 18:29.061

18:35.500 --> 18:36.800
Yo' you're

18:36.802 --> 18:38.185
Well I love her.

18:38.186 --> 18:39.569
You got to give it all when
you love like that, you know?

18:39.571 --> 18:41.537
Yeah, exactly.
Comes once a life, right?

18:41.539 --> 18:43.205
Oh, serious. Yeah, yeah.

18:46.497 --> 18:47.920
Gotta drop those off
and I gotta go to work.

18:47.921 --> 18:49.343
Wanna drop some acid
and go inside the titty bar?

18:49.345 --> 18:52.379
Nah, that's okay. It's 8:15
in the morning, Rose.

18:54.149 --> 18:56.382
- Thank you, Nancy.
- Thank you, Mike.

18:56.384 --> 18:57.449
Bye.

19:30.385 --> 19:32.151
Chariot Progressive. Listen.

19:32.153 --> 19:33.852
Mandelbrot set is in motion.

19:33.854 --> 19:37.223
Echo Choir has been breached,
we are fielding the ball.

19:42.229 --> 19:44.028
Is that a lyric
from something?

19:45.197 --> 19:46.429
Fuck.

19:49.234 --> 19:53.469
No. Chariot Progressive.
Listen.

19:53.471 --> 19:54.536
Okay.

19:55.005 --> 19:57.338
- Mandelbrot set is in motion.
- Yeah.

19:57.340 --> 19:59.540
Ma'am, are you going
to get something?

20:00.010 --> 20:01.509
Chariot Progressive, Mike.

20:01.511 --> 20:03.077
Lady, could you please, like,
stop it with...

20:03.079 --> 20:04.445
Chariot Progressive.

20:04.580 --> 20:06.279
- Are you okay?
- Listen.

20:06.281 --> 20:08.514
Mandelbrot set is in motion.

20:08.516 --> 20:10.215
Echo Choir has been breached.

20:10.217 --> 20:11.549
We are fielding the ball.

20:11.551 --> 20:13.919
Chariot Progressive.
Chariot Progressive.

20:13.921 --> 20:15.387
Listen, Mike.
You're not listening...

20:15.555 --> 20:16.954
Listen. Chariot Progressive!

20:16.956 --> 20:18.255
Chariot Progressive.

20:18.257 --> 20:19.489
Chariot Progressive

20:19.491 --> 20:21.023
Motion...

20:31.367 --> 20:32.577
Mike. Please listen to me.

20:32.578 --> 20:33.788
All right, lady,
enough with that stuff, okay?

20:33.789 --> 20:34.999
You're in danger.
You have to listen to me.

20:35.003 --> 20:36.804
I've got to close up soon.
So...

20:44.111 --> 20:45.410
I'm sorry.

20:46.045 --> 20:47.110
It's okay.

20:47.112 --> 20:49.179
About all of this.
I'm sorry, Mike. I tried.

20:49.648 --> 20:50.913
It's cool.

20:58.388 --> 20:59.620
Do you want your soup?

21:44.168 --> 21:46.101
Hey, stop doing shit
to my car.

22:24.005 --> 22:25.371
- Hey, babes, what's up?
<i>- Hey.</i>

22:25.373 --> 22:26.605
<i>I just killed two people...</i>

22:26.607 --> 22:28.006
<i>Two... Two gentlemen.</i>

22:28.008 --> 22:29.073
That's awesome. Why?

22:29.075 --> 22:30.630
No, these two guys
were trying to, like,

22:30.631 --> 22:32.186
break into my car at work
and they had guns

22:32.187 --> 22:33.742
and knives and they
were, like, being total dicks

22:33.746 --> 22:35.312
<i>and they just attacked me.</i>

22:35.314 --> 22:36.447
Shit, babe, you got mugged?

22:36.449 --> 22:37.548
Then I took, like, a spoon

22:37.550 --> 22:38.649
and I just like, mmm...

22:38.651 --> 22:40.434
I, like, shoved it
through this guy.

22:40.435 --> 22:42.218
- Did you call the police?
<i>- No, I didn't call the police.</i>

22:42.221 --> 22:44.020
'Cause I'm the killer...
I'm the murderer.

22:44.022 --> 22:45.605
I also have, like...

22:45.606 --> 22:47.189
I have, like, a lot of weed
and mushrooms in my car.

22:47.191 --> 22:48.591
I just killed two dudes
in a parking lot, okay,

22:48.593 --> 22:49.758
and Phoebe, if you don't
come here right now,

22:49.760 --> 22:51.659
I'm gonna start like
pissing in my pants.

22:51.661 --> 22:53.227
I swear to God, Phoebe,
I'm just gonna

22:53.229 --> 22:54.528
start like pissing.

22:55.264 --> 22:57.230
How did this happen?

23:00.102 --> 23:01.468
How the fuck did this happen?

23:03.038 --> 23:04.737
I shot those guys in the head.

23:04.739 --> 23:07.239
And that guy, I, like,
I spooned him in the neck

23:07.241 --> 23:09.174
and his shit just,
like, ended.

23:10.110 --> 23:11.643
You just killed two guys?

23:11.645 --> 23:14.412
They were trying to,
like, stab me, Phoebe.

23:14.414 --> 23:15.780
Why are people
trying to stab you?

23:15.782 --> 23:17.314
I don't know! Shh!

23:18.050 --> 23:19.616
I don't know, but I am...

23:20.185 --> 23:22.084
I am, like, freaking out
all over the place.

23:22.086 --> 23:24.387
Babe, I have, like,
a lot of anxiety about this.

23:24.389 --> 23:26.389
<i>Get your hands in the air.</i>

23:26.391 --> 23:28.290
Oh, fuck me! Yup.

23:28.292 --> 23:29.591
<i>Oh, God, it's Mike.</i>

23:29.593 --> 23:31.492
- I'm sorry!
<i>- Drop it.</i>

23:33.662 --> 23:35.294
<i>What do you mean,
two casualties?</i>

23:35.296 --> 23:37.163
We lost two assets
attempting to neutralize

23:37.165 --> 23:38.831
Wiseman-designate Howell.

23:38.833 --> 23:40.098
<i>How is that possible?</i>

23:40.100 --> 23:41.365
He was armed
with a spoon, sir.

23:41.700 --> 23:44.500
<i>A fucking spoon? What?</i>

23:44.502 --> 23:45.767
Uh, we're not sure yet,

23:45.769 --> 23:47.268
the exact nature
of the confrontation...

23:47.270 --> 23:49.537
He's been fucking activated!
Do you not see that?

23:49.539 --> 23:51.272
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>
- This is Lasseter.

23:51.274 --> 23:54.241
She's in the town.
Lock it down and find her.

23:54.243 --> 23:56.443
Shut down the bridge,
nobody gets in or out!

23:56.445 --> 23:58.061
<i>Sir, yes, sir.</i>

23:58.062 --> 23:59.679
- Where's asset Howell now?
<i>- He's been arrested, sir.</i>

23:59.682 --> 24:02.349
Perfect. Okay, we go in.
We take him out.

24:02.351 --> 24:03.650
<i>He's trapped in one place.</i>

24:03.652 --> 24:05.385
<i>You cannot possibly
fuck this up.</i>

24:05.387 --> 24:06.452
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

24:06.454 --> 24:09.855
<i>Employ assets
Crane and Laugher.</i>

24:16.830 --> 24:19.564
Okay, so just lead me
through this one more time.

24:19.566 --> 24:21.365
Just so I'm clear.
Just so...

24:21.367 --> 24:24.802
No, no, no.
Um, I hit him with a spoon

24:24.804 --> 24:27.171
and his lungs exploded.

24:28.240 --> 24:30.406
- It wasn't his lungs.
- No, that's what happened.

24:30.408 --> 24:32.689
'Cause he couldn't breathe,
'cause I got him in the neck.

24:34.145 --> 24:35.812
Your lungs aren't in your
neck, they're in your chest.

24:35.814 --> 24:37.513
I know that, Phoebe.

24:37.515 --> 24:40.182
No, I don't know that.
No, I do.

24:40.184 --> 24:41.716
Phoebe. It doesn't even
make any sense to me.

24:41.718 --> 24:44.385
Okay. Okay. So you said
something about a lady.

24:44.387 --> 24:45.853
- Yeah.
- What did she say to you?

24:45.855 --> 24:47.488
Okay, so she said...

24:48.724 --> 24:51.391
I don't know what she said.
Like, some bullshit. Like...

24:51.860 --> 24:53.326
I don't know what she said.

24:53.328 --> 24:55.428
- Babe. We're in jail.
- Yeah?

24:55.430 --> 24:57.630
So maybe just try
and remember and focus

24:57.632 --> 24:59.733
and put it together.
What did the lady say?

24:59.735 --> 25:00.800
Okay.

25:05.339 --> 25:06.404
She said...

25:06.406 --> 25:10.307
Mandelbrot set is in motion.
Echo Choir has been breached.

25:10.309 --> 25:12.230
<i>We are fielding the ball.</i>

25:16.449 --> 25:17.614
Mike, what the fuck
does that mean?

25:17.616 --> 25:18.848
I don't know.

25:19.750 --> 25:21.049
Phoebe, I don't know

25:21.050 --> 25:23.010
but I remember it
like it just happened.

25:24.254 --> 25:25.419
I remember every single thing
that happened

25:25.421 --> 25:26.586
to me in the last 94 minutes.

25:26.588 --> 25:29.288
94 minutes? How did I even
get that number, Phoebe?

25:29.290 --> 25:30.422
I remember literally
every single thing

25:30.424 --> 25:31.623
that happened,
I can picture it.

25:31.625 --> 25:32.790
- Mike, listen.
- Okay.

25:32.792 --> 25:35.393
Just slow down.

25:35.795 --> 25:37.194
Yeah, Mike.

25:38.430 --> 25:40.829
You slow way down.

25:52.508 --> 25:55.509
How many times have you been
in this station, Mike?

25:55.511 --> 25:56.810
Since you were 22?

25:58.680 --> 26:00.614
Your probation officer must be

26:00.616 --> 26:02.382
the Michael Jordan
of bullshitters.

26:02.384 --> 26:03.916
Because I've never
seen you gone

26:03.918 --> 26:06.585
more than couple of hours?

26:11.693 --> 26:12.692
Mike.

26:12.693 --> 26:14.613
Tell me you didn't
kill these people.

26:14.696 --> 26:16.562
They attacked him.

26:16.564 --> 26:18.404
- He was defending himself.
- Yeah.

26:18.865 --> 26:21.365
- Excuse me?
- What was he supposed to do?

26:22.768 --> 26:24.735
You're his girlfriend.
You're his mom.

26:24.737 --> 26:27.404
You're his maid.
You're his landlady.

26:27.773 --> 26:30.507
- Now you're his lawyer?
- It was just a thing.

26:30.942 --> 26:32.782
It was just a thing
that happened.

26:35.680 --> 26:36.745
Mike...

26:36.747 --> 26:39.981
- I didn't mean to.
- You didn't mean to?

26:41.684 --> 26:42.983
Two men are dead, Mike.

26:42.985 --> 26:44.617
There's no
walking away this time.

26:47.754 --> 26:49.434
- What the hell is that?
- What's going on?

26:49.556 --> 26:51.476
Shit, lock it down!

26:51.990 --> 26:53.389
Hey, we've got a problem.

26:56.460 --> 26:57.792
Why is the power out?

26:57.794 --> 26:59.226
Oh, hell, Phoebe,
I don't know.

26:59.228 --> 27:00.561
Just keep moving.

27:00.563 --> 27:02.796
Hold on. Hold on.

27:03.431 --> 27:05.391
Mike, I really don't want
to go in there.

27:06.367 --> 27:09.868
Mike... There we go.
Just hold on.

27:10.670 --> 27:12.404
All the lines
out of the station are down.

27:12.406 --> 27:14.539
Radio, Internet, the phone...

27:14.541 --> 27:16.007
Who the fuck is that?

27:26.820 --> 27:27.885
Mike!

27:34.959 --> 27:36.292
Mike, grab his gun!

27:45.369 --> 27:46.534
Move! Move! Move!

27:48.805 --> 27:50.838
Get down! Down! Stay down!

28:19.600 --> 28:20.665
Ah!

28:44.958 --> 28:46.924
No, no, get out.
Phoebe, get out!

28:59.939 --> 29:01.004
Oh...

29:06.911 --> 29:07.976
Phoebe, the gun.

29:09.512 --> 29:10.577
Just go!

29:41.870 --> 29:43.069
Get out of here!

29:44.505 --> 29:45.570
Come on!

29:53.447 --> 29:54.847
- Wait!
- Hmm?

29:55.147 --> 29:56.412
Huh?

29:59.785 --> 30:01.518
Uh...

31:20.493 --> 31:21.625
Hi, darlin'.

31:21.626 --> 31:22.758
<i>Why is Liman
on lockdown?</i>

31:22.761 --> 31:24.628
Why are there men
in hazmat suits

31:24.630 --> 31:26.229
walking around
like extra-terrestrials?

31:26.231 --> 31:27.763
What the fuck are you doing?

31:27.765 --> 31:31.700
A dog with rabies got loose.
A real old bitch.

31:31.702 --> 31:32.901
Oh, you're all class, Adrian.

31:32.903 --> 31:34.686
<i>You activated Howell.</i>

31:34.687 --> 31:36.471
Now two of my
Toughguy assets are dead.

31:36.607 --> 31:38.673
I know what you're doing here.
Don't fuck with my operation!

31:38.675 --> 31:40.141
Your operation is murder.

31:40.143 --> 31:41.976
This is the last time
that you and I speak.

31:41.978 --> 31:44.478
I'm taking you down, Yates.
You understand me?

31:44.480 --> 31:46.179
That's pretty big talk
for a middle-aged woman

31:46.181 --> 31:48.515
with a... What? A cell phone?

31:48.517 --> 31:50.817
<i>You can't touch me. Okay...</i>

31:50.819 --> 31:53.252
You can't even...
Did you just hang up on me?

31:53.254 --> 31:56.555
Please tell me you did not
just hang up on me.

31:58.692 --> 32:00.453
Yo, Phoebe,
where are we going?

32:00.894 --> 32:02.793
We are leaving, we are getting
the fuck out of town.

32:02.795 --> 32:04.895
No, I can't leave town,
you know that.

32:05.230 --> 32:06.796
Well, you didn't have people
try to kill you before,

32:06.798 --> 32:09.098
I was thinking maybe
that could motivate us here.

32:09.100 --> 32:11.021
Okay, fine.
So where do you want to go?

32:11.069 --> 32:12.635
- Fuck!
- All right, listen, listen.

32:12.637 --> 32:14.536
We'll take my car and we'll go
to Rose's house, okay?

32:14.538 --> 32:16.004
- What?
- What?

32:16.006 --> 32:17.505
You want to get high
right now, Mike?

32:17.507 --> 32:18.906
No I don't want to get... No.

32:18.908 --> 32:20.540
Rose has like guns
and shit, okay.

32:20.542 --> 32:24.277
He can help us hide out
and I'm still in handcuff.

32:25.947 --> 32:27.012
Okay, you are not
in any position

32:27.014 --> 32:28.079
to be making the plan
right now.

32:28.081 --> 32:29.681
Really?
Well, who is, all right?

32:29.682 --> 32:31.282
- The cops are all dead.
- The guy in the thing,

32:31.284 --> 32:32.883
in the cell thing,

32:32.885 --> 32:34.784
doesn't see the gun,
you don't point at it and go,

32:34.786 --> 32:36.019
"Gun..."

32:38.123 --> 32:40.056
Okay. No, no.
I recognize that now

32:40.058 --> 32:41.524
as, like, a faux pas.
I'm sorry.

32:41.759 --> 32:43.058
Like, and if someone
who's trying to kill you,

32:43.060 --> 32:44.843
goes, "Wait..."

32:44.844 --> 32:46.627
You don't go, "Oh, what do you
want to talk about?"

32:46.830 --> 32:49.164
Okay, you're right.
Sorry. I'm sorry.

32:49.166 --> 32:50.732
Please just don't
yell at me, okay?

32:50.734 --> 32:52.734
- I'm starting to freak out.
- No. I know you are.

32:52.736 --> 32:53.901
I just think that maybe
we need to figure out

32:53.903 --> 32:55.953
what the fuck we're doing...

32:55.954 --> 32:58.004
Come here. You're fine.
I'm fine. All right?

32:58.007 --> 32:59.974
We made it out of there. Okay?

32:59.976 --> 33:02.209
And nothing else is
going to happen, I promise.

33:03.312 --> 33:04.844
Let's just get in my car...

33:05.079 --> 33:06.144
Oh, fuck!

33:08.248 --> 33:09.614
So that's what
those guys were doing?

33:09.616 --> 33:10.881
That would have hurt.

33:12.285 --> 33:13.550
Okay,

33:14.886 --> 33:15.951
let's take my car.

33:36.605 --> 33:37.737
Aw.

33:43.177 --> 33:44.777
Hmm.

33:46.979 --> 33:48.044
Hello?

33:48.913 --> 33:50.913
I'm in Liman.
I activated Howell.

33:51.749 --> 33:52.998
What?

33:52.999 --> 33:54.248
<i>Yates' Toughguy assets
are in town.</i>

33:54.251 --> 33:56.351
I'm here trying to save
asset Howell

33:56.353 --> 33:58.119
and derail this operation.

33:58.121 --> 33:59.287
<i>But something's not right.</i>

33:59.289 --> 34:00.588
<i>I'm standing in front</i>

34:00.589 --> 34:01.888
<i>of the sheriff station
which is on fire.</i>

34:01.891 --> 34:03.607
I don't understand...

34:03.608 --> 34:05.324
Why would you...
I should not be talking...

34:05.327 --> 34:07.727
Listen to me. I need a weapon.

34:07.729 --> 34:08.878
Oh, my God.

34:08.879 --> 34:10.027
<i>There's an empty field.
I'm going to send you</i>

34:10.031 --> 34:11.264
<i>coordinates for the drop.</i>

34:11.266 --> 34:12.864
And I need to know
where the fuck

34:12.867 --> 34:15.333
Yates is pulling the subjects
for this operation.

34:15.335 --> 34:16.819
<i>If they're trained assets,</i>

34:16.820 --> 34:18.303
<i>they should be doing this
quickly and quietly.</i>

34:18.304 --> 34:19.971
<i>This behavior makes no sense.</i>

34:19.973 --> 34:22.172
Okay, I'm sorry.
I gotta hang up. I can't...

34:22.175 --> 34:24.775
<i>No, no, no. No, no, no.
Don't hang up. Don't hang up.</i>

34:24.777 --> 34:26.194
He's boxing me in,
in this town.

34:26.195 --> 34:27.610
He's going to trap me like a
rat and he's going to kill me.

34:28.380 --> 34:30.246
<i>Please, Petey,
I really need you.</i>

34:38.157 --> 34:39.889
Okay, here we go.

34:51.735 --> 34:52.800
Hey.

34:55.337 --> 34:58.171
Hey, you seem, like,
spooky quiet.

34:59.208 --> 35:00.974
I am spooky quiet.

35:02.110 --> 35:03.175
I'm like...

35:03.844 --> 35:06.177
I think I'm in
anaphylactic shock.

35:08.814 --> 35:10.280
That's not what that's called.

35:10.282 --> 35:12.850
Like, I'm trying to think
of stuff, you know...

35:12.852 --> 35:14.751
Phoebe, I can't
remember anything.

35:14.753 --> 35:15.885
Like I never even...

35:15.887 --> 35:18.654
I can't even remember
where I went to school.

35:18.656 --> 35:20.355
- Maybe don't think about it.
- Did I go to school?

35:20.357 --> 35:21.422
Uh...

35:22.124 --> 35:24.058
Did we even talk
about my parents?

35:25.761 --> 35:28.828
We walk from here.
Is that what's happening now?

35:28.830 --> 35:30.350
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

35:38.740 --> 35:40.180
- Shit.
- What?

35:43.277 --> 35:46.177
What if I'm like...
Like a robot?

35:47.748 --> 35:48.813
No. No...

35:48.815 --> 35:50.948
With gigabytes
of memory recall,

35:51.684 --> 35:53.216
and, like, karate programming
where I use

35:53.218 --> 35:54.750
objects to kill people.

35:55.119 --> 35:56.418
Mike, you're not a robot.

35:57.287 --> 35:59.321
With advanced
biological engineering.

35:59.690 --> 36:00.789
Maybe I am.

36:03.226 --> 36:04.492
- Mike.
- Yeah?

36:04.493 --> 36:06.493
- You are not a robot.
- But how do you know?

36:06.895 --> 36:09.395
I have the weirdest thoughts
in my head right now.

36:09.397 --> 36:10.462
I know. I know, babe.

36:10.464 --> 36:12.465
Do you know
what a M1 Abrams is?

36:13.367 --> 36:14.833
Hmm?

36:14.835 --> 36:16.301
It's a type of tank.

36:16.303 --> 36:19.470
I could list like 50 types
of tanks right now.

36:19.472 --> 36:20.737
When did I learn about tanks?

36:21.973 --> 36:23.674
I didn't.

36:23.675 --> 36:25.375
I know nothing about
tanks or guns or bombs

36:25.377 --> 36:26.909
but I suddenly know, like,

36:26.911 --> 36:28.143
everything about tanks
and guns and...

36:28.145 --> 36:30.025
Freeze, motherfucker!

36:30.079 --> 36:32.012
- Oh, shit, Mike! It's you?
- Rose. Rose.

36:32.014 --> 36:33.447
What the fuck
you doing here, man?

36:33.448 --> 36:34.882
- Can we come over?
- Yo, yo, yo... Get inside!

36:34.884 --> 36:36.049
Get inside right now, man!

36:36.051 --> 36:37.383
Shit crazy tonight.

36:37.385 --> 36:38.884
I ain't tryin' to die
from no monkey disease.

36:38.886 --> 36:40.051
Come on, get inside!

36:48.727 --> 36:50.293
What the fuck?

37:06.476 --> 37:08.375
What the fuck is all this?

37:08.377 --> 37:10.076
- Mr. Yates, sir...
- I said subtle!

37:10.078 --> 37:12.179
I said covert!

37:12.180 --> 37:14.280
Not pitch a tent in the middle
of the fucking parking lot!

37:14.283 --> 37:16.443
- Sir, this is...
- Where are the assets?

37:18.253 --> 37:21.087
You got them all just
sitting in a dark truck?

37:21.089 --> 37:22.756
You said as bare bones
as possible.

37:22.758 --> 37:24.124
Yes. Right, you're right.

37:24.126 --> 37:25.458
Thank you.

37:31.132 --> 37:32.764
Laugher?

37:33.833 --> 37:35.533
What happened to you?
I heard you were KIA.

37:35.535 --> 37:37.351
We recovered him

37:37.352 --> 37:39.168
from the sheriff station
30 minutes ago.

37:39.304 --> 37:41.537
But you saw him, right?
Howell?

37:41.539 --> 37:44.005
He took my teeth.

37:47.077 --> 37:48.475
But I got 'em back.

37:51.379 --> 37:52.444
Oh.

37:54.080 --> 37:55.696
Yeah, thanks.

37:55.697 --> 37:57.313
We just wanna, like, hang out
here for a couple of hours.

37:57.316 --> 37:58.816
'Cause things are like...

37:58.818 --> 37:59.883
I don't know,
but things are, like,

37:59.885 --> 38:01.201
pretty dangerous right now.

38:01.202 --> 38:02.518
Yeah, so why you come
to my house, Mike?

38:02.520 --> 38:04.887
Why didn't you go
to your house, huh?

38:04.889 --> 38:07.556
Crazy is as crazy does
and you dragged crazy here.

38:07.558 --> 38:09.224
And I don't even know what
that does or what that is.

38:09.226 --> 38:10.826
You see what I'm saying?

38:10.828 --> 38:12.311
I don't know, Rose.

38:12.312 --> 38:13.795
We just thought it would
be, like, safer here. Ow.

38:14.197 --> 38:15.396
Safer from what?

38:15.398 --> 38:16.864
Wait, why do you think
it's dangerous?

38:16.866 --> 38:18.082
Yeah?

38:18.083 --> 38:19.763
Like I said to you before
because of the...

38:21.303 --> 38:22.368
The what?

38:22.370 --> 38:24.454
The monkeys. The monkeys!

38:24.455 --> 38:26.538
And, yo, Mike, what you
gonna be safer from, Mike?

38:26.541 --> 38:28.307
What you gonna be safer from?

38:28.309 --> 38:29.508
Rose... I...

38:29.510 --> 38:30.590
Safer from what, Mike?

38:32.245 --> 38:33.811
Perimeter's clear, man.

38:33.813 --> 38:35.513
Yo, this is Big Harold
and Quinzin.

38:35.515 --> 38:37.414
Niggas, this is Mike
and Phoebe.

38:37.816 --> 38:39.148
Mike? Me and Mike
know each other.

38:39.150 --> 38:40.249
Me and Quinzin
know each other.

38:40.251 --> 38:42.084
Ah. Ha-ha! Jinx, right?

38:42.086 --> 38:43.569
Dude, it sucks,

38:43.570 --> 38:45.053
you were in first place
for like three weeks

38:45.055 --> 38:46.454
- and your kickers got hurt.
- I know, man.

38:46.456 --> 38:47.956
What?

38:47.958 --> 38:49.490
We do Fantasy Football
together, you dig?

38:49.492 --> 38:51.492
And you ain't even tell me?

38:51.494 --> 38:52.559
Shit!

38:52.561 --> 38:56.896
Oh, everybody's got a Fantasy
Football league but Rose,

38:56.898 --> 38:57.997
is what you're sayin'.

38:57.999 --> 39:00.367
I guess Rose just sits alone,
I guess.

39:00.369 --> 39:03.069
I don't know nothin'
about no Fantasy Football.

39:03.071 --> 39:04.136
Well that don't make me
feel better, man,

39:04.138 --> 39:05.871
nobody tell you shit.

39:06.039 --> 39:07.271
So hurtful.

39:08.874 --> 39:10.073
Sorry, man, sorry.

39:10.075 --> 39:11.575
But it's all about
conspiracies tonight.

39:11.577 --> 39:14.044
Sorry, can I just ask
about the monkeys?

39:14.046 --> 39:16.579
And the gas masks? What...

39:16.581 --> 39:19.915
You ain't heard? Town's under
the government wildfire.

39:19.917 --> 39:21.416
Outer-space shit, straight

39:21.418 --> 39:24.586
<i>Andromeda Strain</i> bacterial
disease type shit!

39:26.523 --> 39:27.588
I'm sorry?

39:27.590 --> 39:29.089
You ain't seen it?

39:29.091 --> 39:30.890
Fuckin' look at the TV, man!

39:30.892 --> 39:32.024
Look at the fuckin' TV!

39:32.026 --> 39:33.458
Look at that shit,
right there!

39:33.460 --> 39:35.227

40:14.295 --> 40:16.161
You mean, this is the lady
that talked to you?

40:16.163 --> 40:17.262
- Yeah.
- What?

40:17.264 --> 40:18.463
Why the fuck do you know

40:18.465 --> 40:21.466
that monkey fucking
motherfucker, man?

40:21.468 --> 40:23.902
- Dude, calm down.
- Calm down?

40:24.537 --> 40:26.470
I want fuckin' answers now.

40:26.472 --> 40:28.572
Yo! Yo! Yo!

40:28.574 --> 40:30.373
Okay, Rose, listen...

40:30.375 --> 40:32.575
Things don't mean
what you think they mean.

40:33.344 --> 40:35.311
This is going to sound crazy.

40:37.915 --> 40:40.348
Something very weird is
happening to me tonight, okay,

40:40.350 --> 40:41.799
and I don't know what it is,

40:41.800 --> 40:43.249
but I keep,
like killing people, okay.

40:43.252 --> 40:45.352
And there's a chance
I may be a robot.

40:46.956 --> 40:48.121
Oh, shit.

40:48.123 --> 40:50.957
You got the fuckin'
monkey virus.

40:50.959 --> 40:52.325
No, Rose. Stop...

40:52.326 --> 40:53.692
You're fucking going to
quarantine, Mike!

40:53.695 --> 40:55.494
- Rose, mm-mmm, don't do that!
- Wait, wait, wait! No, no!

40:55.496 --> 40:58.430
You're going to quarantine,
motherfucker!

40:58.432 --> 41:00.166
Damn!

41:00.168 --> 41:01.233
Whoa, whoa!

41:01.368 --> 41:02.567
Yo, bitch!

41:07.673 --> 41:09.973
Rose. I'm sorry.

41:19.350 --> 41:20.982
Okay, Rose, can you just,

41:20.984 --> 41:23.652
whatever you do, not call
that number that's on the TV.

41:23.654 --> 41:25.320
You think I'm gonna
call the government?

41:25.322 --> 41:27.288
Bitch, I ain't
trying to get neuralized.

41:27.290 --> 41:29.056
Rose, maybe we could
just talk about this, okay?

41:29.058 --> 41:30.223
Nuh-uh, Mike.

41:30.225 --> 41:31.290
Nuh-uh!

41:32.259 --> 41:33.490
Okay.

41:37.963 --> 41:39.629
- Hey, Rose.
- Yeah?

41:39.631 --> 41:41.631
I think I could probably
break this lock.

41:41.633 --> 41:43.366
- Please don't.
- Okay.

41:44.669 --> 41:47.103
Wow.

41:49.240 --> 41:50.305
Wow.

41:50.573 --> 41:52.573
I've never been down here.

41:53.742 --> 41:55.708
Hey, Phoebe...

41:55.710 --> 41:58.611
Phoebe, do you really think
I have that disease?

41:58.613 --> 42:02.047
What? That fake monkey
news-story disease?

42:02.049 --> 42:03.581
How do you know it's fake?

42:04.483 --> 42:07.250
I did meet that woman.

42:18.597 --> 42:20.463
Well, how do you feel?

42:21.265 --> 42:23.032
You feel sick?

42:24.301 --> 42:28.002
No. I feel kinda amazing.

42:51.496 --> 42:53.596
Oh, my God!

42:57.635 --> 42:59.435
Oh, my God.

43:01.638 --> 43:03.671
- Hello?
- Hola, <i>Petey.</i>

43:04.306 --> 43:07.774
<i>Why am I hearing that there's
a supply drop made over Liman?</i>

43:08.543 --> 43:10.109
Do you understand that
you're assisting the efforts

43:10.111 --> 43:11.778
of a rogue CIA operative

43:11.780 --> 43:13.446
acting against
national security?

43:13.448 --> 43:16.115
<i>What do we call that, Petey?</i>

43:16.117 --> 43:18.083
When someone is
actively working against

43:18.085 --> 43:19.250
the interests
of their own country?

43:19.252 --> 43:20.384
Treason.

43:20.386 --> 43:23.421
<i>Gosh, help me out here
because I always forget,</i>

43:23.423 --> 43:26.056
<i>what's the punishment
for treason?</i>

43:26.525 --> 43:29.559
We take you outside and we
shoot you in the fucking head.

43:30.528 --> 43:32.160
<i>Now I'm keenly aware</i>

43:32.162 --> 43:34.162
<i>that you have a degree
of loyalty to Lasseter.</i>

43:34.164 --> 43:37.199
<i>That ends now. You're not to
help her again. Understood?</i>

43:56.486 --> 43:57.785
<i>Thanks for the
location on Howell.</i>

43:57.787 --> 43:59.254
I'm heading to him right now,
but in the meantime

43:59.256 --> 44:01.256
we've got to go public
on this. Call Krueger.

44:01.258 --> 44:02.557
<i>I can't believe
Yates has been training</i>

44:02.559 --> 44:03.658
<i>mental patients
for his program.</i>

44:03.660 --> 44:05.093
It is my duty to inform you

44:05.094 --> 44:06.527
that should you go public
with this operation...

44:06.529 --> 44:08.295
<i>It's your duty? What?</i>

44:08.297 --> 44:09.829
<i>We have to stop this!
He's completely out of his...</i>

44:09.831 --> 44:11.264
If you go public
with this operation,

44:11.266 --> 44:12.365
you're committing treason,

44:12.367 --> 44:13.566
and will be treated
as a traitor

44:13.568 --> 44:14.767
<i>to the United States
of America.</i>

44:14.769 --> 44:17.202
No! Pete? Peter?

44:17.204 --> 44:18.764
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>
- Petey!

44:19.505 --> 44:21.605
I can't help you anymore.

44:23.576 --> 44:25.142
Fuck!

44:30.883 --> 44:32.582
Phoebe, what are you doing?

44:34.319 --> 44:35.752
We are escaping.

44:38.723 --> 44:40.889
Phoebe. No, Phoebe, stop.

44:40.891 --> 44:42.891
I really don't think we should
do this, okay?

44:42.893 --> 44:44.309
I think we should
just wait here.

44:44.310 --> 44:45.726
Rose is like a really good
guy, he'll come around.

44:45.729 --> 44:47.730
You'll see. He's just
a sensitive and complex man.

44:47.732 --> 44:49.398
Babe, I'm not going to
sit around

44:49.400 --> 44:51.480
and wait on the judgment
of your drug dealer.

44:56.339 --> 44:57.738
<i>Do we have
a location on Howell?</i>

44:57.740 --> 44:59.440
He's at his friend's house.

44:59.909 --> 45:02.309
Okay, we roll in waves.
Got it?

45:02.311 --> 45:04.277
Employ Newton,
Laugher and Bourbon.

45:04.279 --> 45:05.411
Is the press package ready?

45:05.413 --> 45:06.478
- Yes, sir.
- Activate it.

45:06.813 --> 45:07.878
And...

45:08.380 --> 45:11.248
I'm clearing
use of Riofloxin gas.

45:15.420 --> 45:18.320
<i>No more risks.
No more mistakes.</i>

45:18.322 --> 45:20.488
<i>Clean sweep.</i>

45:26.162 --> 45:27.261
Fuck!

45:29.198 --> 45:30.197
Do you know
what you're doing?

45:30.198 --> 45:31.197
I'm just going to scoot
a little bit further

45:31.200 --> 45:32.699
and see if I can get
into the other room.

45:32.701 --> 45:34.702
Just give me one second.

45:44.546 --> 45:46.780
This is not the right moment.

45:49.250 --> 45:50.282
What do you mean,
Quinzin,

45:50.284 --> 45:51.817
I can't be in your league?

45:51.818 --> 45:53.351
- I know football. Dang.
- It's too late, man.

45:53.353 --> 45:55.386
Too late?
It's never too late.

45:56.922 --> 45:58.289
Whoa!

45:58.291 --> 45:59.623
What the...

46:01.860 --> 46:02.925
Oh.

46:06.929 --> 46:08.594
Oh, shit! Phoebe!

46:11.900 --> 46:13.199
Oh, shit!

46:23.976 --> 46:25.342
What?

46:59.672 --> 47:02.339
Babe, come here. Hey, honey?

47:02.341 --> 47:04.808
Mike... Come here. Come here.

47:04.810 --> 47:07.243
Hey, wake up! Wake up!
Come on, come on.

47:07.245 --> 47:08.978
You have to stay awake,
all right?

47:08.980 --> 47:11.381
Hey, that Riofloxin shit,

47:11.383 --> 47:12.548
it's going to make you
really tired!

47:12.550 --> 47:14.516
This is going to
help a little bit.

47:14.518 --> 47:16.784
Only if you stay awake
for me, okay?

47:16.786 --> 47:19.586
- I feel sleepy.
- Don't sleep! Don't sleep!

47:19.588 --> 47:20.653
Baby, if you sleep you die.

47:20.655 --> 47:21.720
Okay? If you sleep
you die, Mike.

47:21.722 --> 47:23.172
That's how this shit works.

47:23.173 --> 47:24.622
Shuts down your senses one
by one. Keep your eyes open!

47:24.625 --> 47:26.424
Baby, keep your
fucking eyes open!

47:26.426 --> 47:28.726
Honey? Honey? Babe!

47:29.929 --> 47:32.429
Babe, wake up! Wake up!
Wake up, okay?

47:32.431 --> 47:34.331
Fuck! Babe...

47:34.333 --> 47:36.566
No, what the fuck! No!

47:36.568 --> 47:38.701
What about Chip the Brick?
Hey! What about...

47:38.703 --> 47:40.035
What about Apollo Ape?

47:40.037 --> 47:41.903
I love them. I love them...

47:41.905 --> 47:43.571
If you die, they die.

47:43.573 --> 47:45.773
I don't want them to fucking
die. I love you, babe.

47:45.775 --> 47:46.856
Babe! Please!

47:50.580 --> 47:51.879
<i>Mike, wake up.</i>

47:59.489 --> 48:01.089
<i>I love you.</i>

48:05.594 --> 48:06.659
<i>Look at me.</i>

48:07.962 --> 48:11.731
Mike, you won't remember this,
but I love you.

48:17.905 --> 48:20.572
<i>...new start,
away from all this.</i>

48:25.346 --> 48:26.478
<i>Just you and me.</i>

48:28.815 --> 48:30.447
<i>You're free.</i>

48:31.383 --> 48:32.815
<i>Away from all this.</i>

48:33.884 --> 48:35.384
<i>I love you.</i>

48:35.853 --> 48:37.352
<i>It's over. I love you.</i>

48:37.887 --> 48:41.021
<i>Interview number 13985.</i>

48:41.990 --> 48:43.522
<i>This is our
last session, Mike.</i>

48:43.524 --> 48:44.723
Mike!

48:44.725 --> 48:45.924
<i>You won't see me again.</i>

48:45.926 --> 48:48.060
<i>I love you. It's over.</i>

48:48.062 --> 48:50.328
Wake up. Please!

48:50.330 --> 48:52.096
<i>Wake up! Mike.</i>

48:52.098 --> 48:53.831
<i>Mike, you gotta wake up.</i>

48:54.466 --> 48:55.531
Mike! Mike!

48:55.533 --> 48:57.032
Please!

49:01.670 --> 49:02.869
Okay.

49:06.941 --> 49:08.006
Hey.

49:08.008 --> 49:09.640
No, no.

49:14.447 --> 49:16.287
How do you know
what that gas was?

49:18.550 --> 49:20.683
Okay... I...

49:22.421 --> 49:25.722
No, no, no. What is going on?
How do you know...

49:25.724 --> 49:27.390
How do you know
what that gas was?

49:27.392 --> 49:29.692
I don't know what's going on.
But, listen...

49:30.361 --> 49:32.361
- Baby...
- No. No.

49:32.363 --> 49:34.530
Okay, Mike.
Mike. Mike... Hey...

49:34.532 --> 49:36.465
I don't know what's going on.

49:36.467 --> 49:38.033
But I do know what's going on
with you, okay.

49:38.035 --> 49:40.001
If you just listen... Listen.

49:40.003 --> 49:41.569
Okay, tell me then.

49:41.571 --> 49:44.638
It's not going to make
any sense right now.

49:44.640 --> 49:47.408
What is going on?
What's going on with me?

49:50.713 --> 49:52.012
I...

49:54.649 --> 49:56.115
I'm your handler.

49:56.117 --> 49:57.983
I was assigned to you
five years ago.

49:57.985 --> 49:59.852
- And...
- My handler?

50:00.087 --> 50:03.521
Please understand...
I'm CIA, okay.

50:03.523 --> 50:04.855
- But...
- Hmm? You're what?

50:04.857 --> 50:07.123
- Listen to me. It's okay.
- You're what?

50:07.125 --> 50:09.525
I've been trying to tell you
this for so fucking long.

50:09.527 --> 50:12.595
Phoebe... Are you not...
Are you not my girlfriend?

50:13.497 --> 50:14.829
Of course I'm your girlfriend.

50:14.831 --> 50:16.897
- Babe, that's what...
- Please stop it.

50:16.899 --> 50:18.531
That's what I'm telling you.
No...

50:18.533 --> 50:20.599
Please stop it. No.
I can't even look at you.

50:20.601 --> 50:22.535
No, no, no, I gotta go.

50:24.005 --> 50:25.404
Mike!

50:25.973 --> 50:27.773
Mike, you have to
let me explain!

50:32.445 --> 50:35.046
- No. No. No... Mike...
- No, no, no.

50:35.048 --> 50:36.614
- Hey...
- Leave me alone!

50:36.616 --> 50:38.849
- Unlock the door, Mike!
- Leave me alone!

50:40.152 --> 50:41.417
Oh, shit!

50:43.687 --> 50:45.720
No, no, no. Get off of me.
Get off of me!

50:45.722 --> 50:46.888
Mike, relax...

50:51.760 --> 50:53.960
Look, I just need to know.

50:55.430 --> 50:56.996
Am I real?

50:57.631 --> 50:59.164
Yes, you're real.

51:00.600 --> 51:01.932
Are your parents really dead?

51:05.771 --> 51:08.004
Okay, how much of everything
that you've ever told me

51:08.006 --> 51:09.538
is just a complete lie?

51:10.642 --> 51:12.642
Not everything is a lie.

51:12.644 --> 51:14.677
No, please don't use
your grown-up voice with me.

51:14.679 --> 51:16.229
I'm not.

51:16.230 --> 51:17.780
Okay... No.
I was in love with you.

51:17.782 --> 51:19.815
I am in love with you...
I don't even know who you are!

51:19.817 --> 51:21.767
Fuck, Mike!

51:21.768 --> 51:23.719
No, you don't get to like,
fake cry with me, okay.

51:23.721 --> 51:25.821
They probably like train you
how to do this, don't they?

51:25.823 --> 51:28.857
Fuck with my emotions.
Okay, well stop it.

51:28.859 --> 51:30.458
Please stop it.

51:30.827 --> 51:34.162
Hey! Hey! Stop it, okay!
Fucking stop it!

51:39.569 --> 51:41.201
I'm not lying anymore.

51:42.103 --> 51:43.635
Just give me one chance.

51:43.637 --> 51:45.477
I'm not going to
lie to you, okay?

51:46.874 --> 51:48.106
Get out.

51:48.675 --> 51:50.608
No. No, Mike.

51:50.610 --> 51:52.142
Phoebe, get out of my car.

51:52.144 --> 51:53.643
I can't...

51:53.645 --> 51:55.244
- Get out of my car, okay!
- I can't...

51:55.246 --> 51:57.546
- Get out of my car!
- It's my fucking car!

51:57.548 --> 51:59.682
No! Get out of the car! Okay!

52:42.525 --> 52:43.590
Phoebe...

52:54.233 --> 52:55.999
Phoebe!

52:56.001 --> 52:57.567
Phoebe!

53:10.179 --> 53:12.979
I'm supposed to
bring you in alive.

53:15.049 --> 53:17.616
Lucky you!

53:18.085 --> 53:19.284
Oh, shit!

53:20.720 --> 53:21.785
Fuck!

53:24.891 --> 53:26.123
No, no, no.

53:26.125 --> 53:28.658
Bang! Bang! Bang!

53:32.329 --> 53:34.630
Phoebe! Phoebe!

53:35.199 --> 53:36.731
Phoebe!

53:37.734 --> 53:39.800
I'm going to do
something very bad.

53:48.911 --> 53:50.871
Phoebe!

54:08.662 --> 54:10.162
Oh, shit! What is that?

54:10.164 --> 54:11.763
It smells like gas!

54:11.765 --> 54:13.698
- Gas!
- No! No!

54:13.700 --> 54:15.132
Fuck! No! No! No, don't!

54:16.668 --> 54:18.668
Oh, fuck! Oh, man!

54:19.771 --> 54:21.303
I fucking hate you, man!

54:21.305 --> 54:23.773
Well, I fucking
hate you too, man!

54:39.257 --> 54:40.689
Oh, shit!

54:43.726 --> 54:47.729
Hey, I wanna show you
something! Hey, wake up.

54:55.238 --> 54:56.637
Hey, wake up!

54:56.639 --> 54:59.073
I said I wanna
show you something.

55:00.843 --> 55:01.908
Look!

55:07.148 --> 55:09.414
Mike! Mike!

55:24.799 --> 55:25.964
Sir!

55:27.167 --> 55:31.702
Well, if it isn't
Miss Stockholm Syndrome 2010.

55:31.704 --> 55:33.938
Yates. What the fuck
are you doing here?

55:33.940 --> 55:37.408
Whoa. That's unprofessional.

55:37.410 --> 55:38.675
Who's running this operation?

55:40.912 --> 55:43.012
Since when did desk jockeys
like you run field ops?

55:43.014 --> 55:44.179
Well, I guess
that's the problem

55:44.181 --> 55:46.049
with going dark
for five years.

55:46.050 --> 55:47.917
You kinda fall out of the loop
on a couple of things.

55:47.919 --> 55:49.919
Do you have
authorization at all?

55:49.921 --> 55:51.120
Where's Krueger?

55:51.122 --> 55:52.821
Phoebe Selburg,

55:52.823 --> 55:54.923
she who'd rather suck
some stoner's cock

55:54.925 --> 55:57.025
than turn herself back
in for debrief,

55:57.027 --> 55:59.728
is going to question
my authorization?

55:59.730 --> 56:01.696
I've read your file.

56:02.265 --> 56:04.698
You have no secrets from me!

56:06.001 --> 56:07.767
Your boyfriend isn't real.

56:09.203 --> 56:10.836
We made him.

56:12.206 --> 56:13.772
Oh, I'm so sorry,

56:13.774 --> 56:15.340
that some lab-rat
made you cum a bunch of times

56:15.342 --> 56:16.791
in the back of a Taco Bell!

56:16.792 --> 56:18.241
Yeah, that's probably
a good reason to throw away

56:18.244 --> 56:20.377
your entire life!

56:20.379 --> 56:22.313
Well, I guess
it all worked out.

56:22.315 --> 56:23.714
Because look where I am now.

56:23.716 --> 56:25.476
In charge
of a major operation.

56:26.818 --> 56:28.717
And look where you are.

56:30.754 --> 56:32.420
Under departmental arrest
for insubordination.

56:32.422 --> 56:33.922
And your face
is all messed up.

56:33.924 --> 56:36.190
And I'm gonna get a promotion.

56:36.191 --> 56:38.457
Your pathetic stoner boyfriend
has been burned alive.

56:44.798 --> 56:46.331
Hey. Hey.

56:47.300 --> 56:48.365
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

56:48.867 --> 56:51.167
- It's okay. It's okay. Hi.
- Hi.

56:54.205 --> 56:55.771
Mike, do you recognize me?

56:55.773 --> 56:57.472
Do you know who I am?

56:59.109 --> 57:01.069
Yeah, you're the woman
from the market.

57:01.477 --> 57:02.943
Yeah.

57:04.179 --> 57:06.045
Do you really know who I am?

57:07.515 --> 57:09.081
Are you my mother?

57:10.852 --> 57:11.917
No.

57:13.387 --> 57:16.287
Okay, you know what,
I gotta take you somewhere.

57:16.289 --> 57:17.888
- No, no, no.
- We got to go someplace safe.

57:17.890 --> 57:18.922
No, we have to.
You're coming with me. No...

57:18.924 --> 57:20.390
No, I'm...

57:20.391 --> 57:21.858
Stop. I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me

57:21.859 --> 57:23.325
what the hell is going on
with me, okay?

57:23.329 --> 57:24.961
Who are you

57:25.430 --> 57:28.264
and what did they do
with my girlfriend?

57:28.266 --> 57:29.531
Okay.

57:32.469 --> 57:34.903
Do you remember

57:34.905 --> 57:38.506
when you were arrested
when you were 18 for the acid?

57:39.175 --> 57:41.008
That was when we first met.

57:41.010 --> 57:43.877
I was recruiting people for
a program called Wiseman.

57:44.212 --> 57:45.812
Which was basically designed

57:45.814 --> 57:48.347
to take third strike
misdemeanor offenders

57:48.949 --> 57:51.950
and offer them
the opportunity to volunteer.

57:51.952 --> 57:53.818
Volunteer? For what?

57:53.820 --> 57:56.020
To be... To be an experiment.

57:56.022 --> 57:57.989
An experiment?

58:00.393 --> 58:01.859
Yeah.

58:03.095 --> 58:04.894
That was a mistake.

58:04.896 --> 58:07.096
No, but Mike, you worked.

58:07.098 --> 58:08.831
All the other subjects
that came in,

58:08.833 --> 58:09.899
they were all failures.

58:09.901 --> 58:11.433
But not you.

58:12.335 --> 58:14.234
You were a success.

58:18.406 --> 58:21.240
But it was driving you insane.

58:21.242 --> 58:23.243
It was driving
everybody insane.

58:25.146 --> 58:28.313
The risks weren't
worth the rewards.

58:28.315 --> 58:30.048
So I shut it down,

58:30.050 --> 58:34.019
and I gave you all
new lives and new identities.

58:34.021 --> 58:36.254
- A fresh start here.
- Yeah.

58:37.323 --> 58:39.589
So you erased my memories.

58:40.491 --> 58:42.958
And you fucked with my head.

58:43.493 --> 58:47.963
And you left me here
with a fake girlfriend.

58:50.233 --> 58:52.166
- No.
- No, Mike, Mike, wait.

58:53.269 --> 58:55.335
This isn't who
you always were.

58:55.337 --> 58:58.038
The slow thinking,
the inability to leave town.

58:59.074 --> 59:02.375
The phobias...
We did that to protect you.

59:02.377 --> 59:04.110
- To protect me?
- Yeah.

59:04.112 --> 59:05.878
Well tell that to the guys
who are trying to kill me.

59:05.880 --> 59:07.246
Who the fuck are those people?

59:07.248 --> 59:10.183
Hey. You're the lady from TV!

59:10.185 --> 59:11.284
Hey.

59:12.220 --> 59:13.285
You fuck monkeys!

59:14.154 --> 59:15.219
What?

59:15.521 --> 59:17.454
Mike, where are you going?

59:19.891 --> 59:21.625
Sir, asset Howell
is still alive.

59:21.627 --> 59:23.377
He and Agent Lasseter

59:23.378 --> 59:25.578
were spotted at the gas
station near Chestnut Street.

59:26.564 --> 59:27.629
Shit!

59:36.873 --> 59:38.572
- Hello?
- Hola, <i>Petey.</i>

59:38.574 --> 59:41.308
I need a drone in the sky
in less than an hour.

59:41.310 --> 59:43.270
Call me when it's entering
my air-space.

59:47.016 --> 59:48.415
So you're going to blow up

59:48.417 --> 59:49.516
- a civilian town?
- If I have to.

59:49.518 --> 59:51.050
To catch one guy?

59:51.052 --> 59:53.318
This is it, Pheebs.

59:54.220 --> 59:56.053
The kid gloves are off.

01:00:07.934 --> 01:00:10.969
It's fine. Go back to work!

01:00:34.094 --> 01:00:35.293
Sir, new sighting.

01:00:35.295 --> 01:00:37.995
Two subjects
heading east on Perryman Way.

01:00:39.198 --> 01:00:40.697
They're going
back to the house.

01:00:40.699 --> 01:00:42.739
He's not just going to go
back to the house.

01:00:43.133 --> 01:00:44.665
Mike can be
a little slow sometimes,

01:00:44.667 --> 01:00:46.000
but he's not a fucking idiot.

01:00:46.002 --> 01:00:47.167
Mike,
I can't believe

01:00:47.169 --> 01:00:48.735
you're going
back to your house.

01:00:48.736 --> 01:00:50.302
I'm going inside
and I'm going to sleep.

01:00:50.305 --> 01:00:51.370
He could have snipers

01:00:51.372 --> 01:00:52.537
taking aim at us right now.

01:00:52.539 --> 01:00:53.604
Really? Then shoot me, please!

01:00:53.606 --> 01:00:54.671
So what?

01:00:54.673 --> 01:00:56.339
Why are you still here?

01:00:56.341 --> 01:00:57.406
I don't want you to die.

01:00:57.408 --> 01:00:58.474
Why?

01:00:59.043 --> 01:01:00.642
Because...

01:01:01.177 --> 01:01:03.043
Because I care about you,
all right?

01:01:03.045 --> 01:01:05.111
Okay, well I don't care,
all right.

01:01:05.113 --> 01:01:08.514
If I die, I'm going to
do it stoned,

01:01:08.516 --> 01:01:10.683
and smiling in my bed.

01:01:10.685 --> 01:01:13.585
And you can stay
or you can go.

01:01:16.289 --> 01:01:18.589
Otis, I need you and
Beedle to go to the house

01:01:18.591 --> 01:01:21.492
and confirm the location of
Lasseter and asset Howell.

01:01:22.394 --> 01:01:23.659
Now, thank you, now!

01:01:23.661 --> 01:01:24.701
Sir, yes, sir.

01:01:28.965 --> 01:01:30.765
What the fuck
are you looking at?

01:02:00.764 --> 01:02:02.497
Who's Apollo Ape?

01:02:06.736 --> 01:02:09.002
He's a monkey astronaut.

01:02:09.004 --> 01:02:11.472
I made him up.
He goes on adventures.

01:02:18.413 --> 01:02:21.080
Hey, Mike, you know Phoebe
was supposed to come back in.

01:02:26.154 --> 01:02:29.388
When you were in the program,
she always looked out for you.

01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:31.356
As all the other assets
kept failing,

01:02:31.358 --> 01:02:33.592
you kept succeeding.

01:02:33.594 --> 01:02:35.527
She had so much faith in you.

01:02:37.497 --> 01:02:39.463
You were real to her.

01:02:40.065 --> 01:02:42.165
She was just supposed to
get you settled into this town

01:02:42.167 --> 01:02:44.567
and then she was
going to be reassigned.

01:02:46.138 --> 01:02:48.271
But she decided
to stay with you.

01:02:48.273 --> 01:02:49.772
She gave up everything,

01:02:49.774 --> 01:02:51.406
her whole real life.

01:02:52.375 --> 01:02:54.341
Just thought
you should know that.

01:03:01.649 --> 01:03:03.482
Miss Lasseter?

01:03:24.169 --> 01:03:25.368
Come here.

01:03:26.337 --> 01:03:28.170
Asset Howell
confirmed on site!

01:03:28.172 --> 01:03:30.071
Sir, asset Howell
confirmed on site.

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:31.772
Requesting immediate backup.

01:03:31.774 --> 01:03:34.108
Copy that.
Drone strike is a go, call it.

01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:35.209
But what about Otis?

01:03:35.211 --> 01:03:37.177
Drone strike is a go! Call it!

01:03:37.179 --> 01:03:38.411
We are go for strike.

01:03:38.413 --> 01:03:39.712
<i>Roger, go for strike.</i>

01:03:39.714 --> 01:03:42.481
<i>Agent Douglas, please confirm.</i>

01:03:43.417 --> 01:03:44.582
Go for strike.

01:03:44.584 --> 01:03:46.418
<i>Moving into attack position.</i>

01:03:48.755 --> 01:03:51.222
Okay.
There you go. All right.

01:03:52.391 --> 01:03:54.657
Oh, shit! Okay, stay here.

01:04:29.395 --> 01:04:30.761
Beedle!

01:04:44.676 --> 01:04:46.276
<i>Target lock in progress.</i>

01:04:46.278 --> 01:04:47.777
<i>Waiting confirmation
to strike.</i>

01:04:47.779 --> 01:04:48.844
Fire!

01:04:48.846 --> 01:04:51.179
<i>Agent Douglas,
please confirm deployment.</i>

01:04:51.181 --> 01:04:52.847
<i>Fucking fire!</i>

01:04:52.849 --> 01:04:55.349
What the fuck is wrong
with you! Drop it now!

01:05:05.762 --> 01:05:06.927
Drop it!

01:05:16.705 --> 01:05:18.438
Now! Fire! Now!

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:19.539
<i>Agent Douglas?</i>

01:05:19.541 --> 01:05:21.173
<i>We're losing
our target window.</i>

01:05:21.175 --> 01:05:23.376
<i>- Do you copy? Agent Douglas!
- Fucking idiot!</i>

01:05:49.238 --> 01:05:54.240
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,</i>

01:05:54.775 --> 01:05:57.843
<i>- five, four, three, two...</i>
- No, fuck you.

01:06:00.747 --> 01:06:02.980
<i>Target lock disengaged.</i>

01:06:06.719 --> 01:06:08.585
Predator satellite link down.

01:06:08.587 --> 01:06:11.655
Ground station has lost
communication with the drone.

01:06:16.427 --> 01:06:17.526
Wow.

01:06:17.528 --> 01:06:20.628
The ol' frying pan
bullet trick.

01:06:33.942 --> 01:06:35.975
Shit. Oh, shit!

01:06:51.891 --> 01:06:52.957
This is Krueger.

01:06:52.958 --> 01:06:54.598
<i>Hello, Mr. Krueger.</i>

01:06:54.926 --> 01:06:56.558
<i>Um, do you have a minute?</i>

01:07:08.404 --> 01:07:10.365
<i>All personnel evacuate.</i>

01:07:10.774 --> 01:07:12.707
<i>All personnel evacuate.</i>

01:07:12.709 --> 01:07:13.774
<i>Initiate immediate</i>

01:07:13.776 --> 01:07:15.041
<i>non-combatant
evacuation protocol.</i>

01:07:15.043 --> 01:07:16.475
<i>All transport vehicles...</i>

01:07:28.322 --> 01:07:29.754
Otis,

01:07:31.324 --> 01:07:33.165
how'd you get tied up
in all this?

01:07:36.895 --> 01:07:38.828
Don't answer that.

01:07:38.830 --> 01:07:40.329
What if it's the guys
who have Phoebe?

01:07:40.331 --> 01:07:41.930
It definitely is.

01:07:41.932 --> 01:07:43.064
Okay, then I'm
going to answer it.

01:07:43.066 --> 01:07:44.331
No, Mike.

01:07:50.439 --> 01:07:52.338
- Hello?
- Hello.

01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:53.605
<i>Who's this?</i>

01:07:54.407 --> 01:07:55.472
You first.

01:07:55.474 --> 01:07:58.909
Oh, fuck me.
It's you, isn't it?

01:07:58.911 --> 01:08:01.645
<i>- It's Mike Howell.</i>
- Yeah. Who's this?

01:08:01.647 --> 01:08:03.413
Is the house not all

01:08:04.616 --> 01:08:06.566
on fire?

01:08:06.567 --> 01:08:08.607
No. Man, the house
is like basically normal.

01:08:10.955 --> 01:08:12.354
Okay.

01:08:12.356 --> 01:08:13.788
<i>So what's the plan now?</i>

01:08:13.790 --> 01:08:16.791
I mean, like,
like do you surrender?

01:08:16.792 --> 01:08:18.626
<i>Fuck! You got me.</i>

01:08:19.428 --> 01:08:20.859
I surrender.

01:08:21.763 --> 01:08:24.796
Why don't you come on down to
the Max Goods parking lot,

01:08:25.399 --> 01:08:26.631
and accept my surrender.

01:08:26.633 --> 01:08:28.832
- The Max Goods on Wilson?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

01:08:28.835 --> 01:08:31.635
Yeah, is that one across
from the tire shop?

01:08:31.636 --> 01:08:32.836
The Ten Minute Tires?

01:08:32.837 --> 01:08:35.104
What? Yes! That Max Goods.

01:08:35.107 --> 01:08:36.473
So what happens
if I meet you there?

01:08:36.475 --> 01:08:37.941
Like, how do you accept
a surrender?

01:08:37.943 --> 01:08:39.143
Do I need to sign something?

01:08:45.017 --> 01:08:46.816
Uh, your girlfriend's here.

01:08:47.685 --> 01:08:49.725
Would you ever like to
see her alive again?

01:08:51.323 --> 01:08:53.057
I don't know.

01:08:55.158 --> 01:08:58.091
So if I just took out my gun
and blew her fucking face off,

01:08:58.095 --> 01:08:59.960
you'd be cool with that?

01:09:03.598 --> 01:09:05.430
No, that wouldn't be cool.

01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:07.832
Is she really there with you?

01:09:22.884 --> 01:09:24.049
Mikey?

01:09:28.888 --> 01:09:30.319
I'm sorry.

01:09:33.024 --> 01:09:34.791
But I'm the tree.

01:09:36.426 --> 01:09:38.587
I've been the tree the entire
time, you're the car.

01:09:39.997 --> 01:09:41.129
<i>Okay?</i>

01:09:43.133 --> 01:09:44.432
<i>I love you.</i>

01:09:47.203 --> 01:09:49.203
So you can leave,
you can go wherever you want

01:09:49.206 --> 01:09:50.939
and they will fucking never...

01:09:57.546 --> 01:09:59.178
That was really fucking lame.

01:10:05.986 --> 01:10:07.285
Mike, what are you doing?

01:10:07.287 --> 01:10:10.355
I'm going to save my
girlfriend from Max Goods.

01:10:15.128 --> 01:10:17.595
Get out!
Get out of the fucking truck!

01:10:17.597 --> 01:10:20.464
You're all now
Code-3 right now!

01:10:20.466 --> 01:10:22.900
Go! Go! Faster! Go!

01:10:22.902 --> 01:10:24.902
Go! This is it!

01:10:26.071 --> 01:10:28.271
This is the moment
that I have trained you for!

01:10:28.273 --> 01:10:30.906
This is not a fucking
dress rehearsal, okay!

01:10:31.275 --> 01:10:33.292
This guy is deadly.

01:10:33.293 --> 01:10:35.311
He is silent
and he will sneak up on us.

01:10:35.313 --> 01:10:37.193
Are we clear?

01:10:37.614 --> 01:10:38.879
Fuck!

01:11:00.168 --> 01:11:01.867
Laugher, get out here!

01:11:58.128 --> 01:12:00.394
Hey, Phoebe! Phoebe!

01:12:04.433 --> 01:12:06.399
- <i>Hey, Phoebe...</i>
- Mike!

01:12:07.168 --> 01:12:10.670
<i>I just wanted to say
that, um, I love you.</i>

01:12:10.672 --> 01:12:14.006
<i>And that everything
is going to be okay.</i>

01:12:14.008 --> 01:12:17.476
<i>I mean, not like perfect,
obviously, but better.</i>

01:12:17.478 --> 01:12:19.478
<i>Like we'll probably
have to get a new house,</i>

01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:21.280
<i>- and also cars...</i>
- You two, can you kill him?

01:12:21.282 --> 01:12:23.482
- Please, kill him.
<i>- ...but I'm coming to get you.</i>

01:12:23.484 --> 01:12:26.384
<i>And this will all be over.</i>

01:12:27.253 --> 01:12:28.585
<i>Soon-ish.</i>

01:12:58.582 --> 01:12:59.647
Oh!

01:13:07.389 --> 01:13:09.149
Phoebe!

01:13:35.317 --> 01:13:37.116
Yates, give up!

01:13:37.118 --> 01:13:39.251
Just let me go,
that's all he wants!

01:13:49.029 --> 01:13:50.094
Aah!

01:13:55.601 --> 01:13:57.702
Go! Go!

01:14:01.641 --> 01:14:04.140
- Laugher, grab her.
- Fuck!

01:14:06.477 --> 01:14:07.576
Phoebe!

01:15:02.801 --> 01:15:04.767
Laugher, end this.

01:15:28.525 --> 01:15:30.291
Don't hide!

01:15:31.327 --> 01:15:34.228
Come out.
I really want to talk to you.

01:15:40.133 --> 01:15:41.298
Come out!

01:15:45.304 --> 01:15:46.369
Come here!

01:15:47.839 --> 01:15:49.405
Oh. You know...

01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:53.141
What? What do I know?
What do I know?

01:15:53.143 --> 01:15:54.242
Why don't you tell me
what I know?

01:15:54.244 --> 01:15:55.343
You're fucked!

01:15:55.645 --> 01:15:57.245
Am I? How?

01:15:58.481 --> 01:16:00.914
My pathetic stoner boyfriend...

01:16:01.783 --> 01:16:03.743
He's going to kill you
and you know it.

01:16:05.619 --> 01:16:06.684
You know what?

01:16:07.353 --> 01:16:08.452
Hmm?

01:16:08.454 --> 01:16:09.935
You...

01:16:10.556 --> 01:16:11.621
Huh?

01:16:14.191 --> 01:16:15.523
I think you're a lot like me.

01:16:17.193 --> 01:16:18.258
Ah!

01:16:35.612 --> 01:16:36.677
Ahh!

01:16:50.525 --> 01:16:51.757
Fuck this!

01:16:56.412 --> 01:16:58.296
Fuck you! They're going to be
laughing at your pothead ass

01:16:58.299 --> 01:16:59.665
tomorrow morning at debriefing!

01:16:59.667 --> 01:17:00.899
You know what, Tarzan,

01:17:00.901 --> 01:17:03.301
why don't you go burn
with your fucking ape!

01:17:07.339 --> 01:17:08.705
You're scaring me.

01:17:08.707 --> 01:17:12.309
Will you please come out?
Can we just talk?

01:17:13.245 --> 01:17:14.310
I wanna talk...

01:17:31.592 --> 01:17:32.657
Oh...

01:17:35.462 --> 01:17:36.694
I'm sorry.

01:17:37.596 --> 01:17:39.929
I can't control

01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:45.501
the things that they did
to my head.

01:17:48.372 --> 01:17:51.439
They made you
like they made me.

01:17:54.911 --> 01:17:56.744
But you're better than me.

01:17:59.015 --> 01:18:01.481
Who told you what to do?

01:18:04.452 --> 01:18:05.617
Nobody.

01:18:11.258 --> 01:18:12.657
That must be nice.

01:18:49.829 --> 01:18:52.029
Who's the bitch now, fucker?

01:18:53.799 --> 01:18:55.532
Enough, Lasseter.

01:18:59.839 --> 01:19:01.338
Enough!

01:19:07.412 --> 01:19:08.477
Mike?

01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:10.445
Mike?

01:19:21.091 --> 01:19:22.356
Baby?

01:19:23.559 --> 01:19:24.624
Phoebe...

01:19:35.103 --> 01:19:36.368
Fuck.

01:19:49.647 --> 01:19:50.912
Do you want to go home?

01:19:52.682 --> 01:19:53.747
Okay.

01:19:55.784 --> 01:19:57.351
Okay.

01:21:30.049 --> 01:21:31.148
She said yes!

01:21:37.154 --> 01:21:38.653
She said yes!

01:21:47.630 --> 01:21:50.464
Oh, man, come on,
just give us, like, one...

01:22:12.652 --> 01:22:13.951
- On the ground!
- Ah, perfect.

01:22:17.856 --> 01:22:19.188
Congratulations.
In the fucking woods,

01:22:19.190 --> 01:22:20.657
in the fucking rain!

01:22:20.659 --> 01:22:23.192
That is the level of fuck-up
you have achieved!

01:22:23.194 --> 01:22:24.259
I just want to say, sir,

01:22:24.261 --> 01:22:26.144
that Peter Douglas
should not be held responsible

01:22:26.145 --> 01:22:28.028
for any of his actions
in the last 24 hours.

01:22:28.031 --> 01:22:30.097
Douglas will be dealt with
when he's dealt with.

01:22:30.099 --> 01:22:32.316
You, on the other hand,

01:22:32.317 --> 01:22:34.535
you directly interfered
with a government operation.

01:22:34.537 --> 01:22:35.736
And as a result,

01:22:35.737 --> 01:22:36.936
you caused the death
of innocent civilians.

01:22:37.105 --> 01:22:38.237
Is that correct?

01:22:39.039 --> 01:22:41.506
- Yes, sir.
- You're absolutely right, sir.

01:22:41.741 --> 01:22:43.807
Thanks to Lasseter
activating asset Howell,

01:22:43.809 --> 01:22:45.943
seven American citizens
are now dead.

01:22:46.278 --> 01:22:48.044
In an operation
that wouldn't...

01:22:48.046 --> 01:22:50.046
This is an operation that
you created and spearheaded

01:22:50.048 --> 01:22:52.782
without any authorization,
is that correct?

01:22:52.784 --> 01:22:55.718
Yes, sir,
but you have to understand,

01:22:57.856 --> 01:22:59.188
I was self-starting.

01:22:59.190 --> 01:23:00.689
Excuse me?

01:23:00.691 --> 01:23:01.823
Did I make some mistakes?

01:23:02.625 --> 01:23:03.890
You know, I did.

01:23:03.892 --> 01:23:06.058
Did I take some shortcuts?
Sure.

01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:08.093
But in the end, I was just
doing what I needed to do

01:23:08.095 --> 01:23:09.962
to create
a cost-efficient exploit

01:23:09.964 --> 01:23:11.630
of a system
already put in place.

01:23:11.632 --> 01:23:12.931
And if I pulled it off,

01:23:12.933 --> 01:23:14.999
you'd be thanking me. Right?

01:23:18.604 --> 01:23:21.105
Come on, you'd be
fucking thanking me, right?

01:23:22.241 --> 01:23:24.039
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:23:26.943 --> 01:23:28.242
Thank you.

01:23:28.244 --> 01:23:29.910
Now I'm...

01:23:39.588 --> 01:23:41.187
I don't know
if this is appropriate,

01:23:41.189 --> 01:23:43.556
but please,
please do not kill me.

01:23:44.225 --> 01:23:45.325
I'm your source.

01:23:47.295 --> 01:23:49.695
When I called you
to notify you

01:23:49.697 --> 01:23:51.096
that the sweep was happening,

01:23:51.098 --> 01:23:52.897
I did it out of respect
and courtesy,

01:23:52.899 --> 01:23:55.332
and you've made me
regret that now.

01:23:55.767 --> 01:23:58.835
It was not my intention
for you to act like a child

01:23:58.837 --> 01:24:01.070
and try to save your puppy.

01:24:01.305 --> 01:24:02.894
The puppy was going down,

01:24:02.895 --> 01:24:04.484
I was notifying you
of the puppy's death.

01:24:04.485 --> 01:24:06.074
But the puppy just shit
all over everything!

01:24:06.076 --> 01:24:08.076
You have a crazy,

01:24:08.078 --> 01:24:10.879
scary rabid puppy
that murders people

01:24:11.014 --> 01:24:12.980
and will still need to be
put down.

01:24:13.749 --> 01:24:15.749
You understand that? Correct?

01:24:16.118 --> 01:24:17.650
Yes, sir.

01:24:17.652 --> 01:24:20.185
You better pray you can find
a way to turn this into a win

01:24:20.655 --> 01:24:22.535
and pull a miracle
out of your ass!

01:24:22.656 --> 01:24:23.988
Because if you can't...

01:24:28.194 --> 01:24:29.293
That's you.

01:24:32.999 --> 01:24:34.879
You already have
your miracle, sir.

01:24:35.834 --> 01:24:37.667
My program worked.

01:24:38.269 --> 01:24:40.369
Wiseman beat Toughguy.

01:24:40.804 --> 01:24:43.638
Mike Howell eliminated

01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:45.974
17 Toughguy assets
single-handedly.

01:24:47.677 --> 01:24:49.643
That makes him
the most effective asset

01:24:49.645 --> 01:24:51.611
we've ever seen
in any of the Ultra Programs.

01:24:51.613 --> 01:24:53.179
Ever. In 60 years.

01:24:54.215 --> 01:24:55.814
Pardon me for saying it, sir.

01:24:57.185 --> 01:24:59.084
But that is a puppy
worth saving.

01:25:00.654 --> 01:25:02.954
That is a $400 million puppy.

01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:07.057
And you have him sitting
in a holding cell right now.

01:25:09.295 --> 01:25:11.135
You're just going
to put him down?

01:25:37.755 --> 01:25:39.387
Where do you
want to begin,

01:25:39.389 --> 01:25:40.821
Agent Howell?

01:26:23.966 --> 01:26:25.098
I'll be up in a minute.

01:26:25.333 --> 01:26:26.398
Okay.

01:26:55.195 --> 01:26:56.461
Hello. Hi.

01:27:01.367 --> 01:27:02.899
They took the bait.

01:27:51.547 --> 01:27:53.480
Something funny?

01:27:54.305 --> 01:28:00.606
