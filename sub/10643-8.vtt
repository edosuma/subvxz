00:16.265 --> 00:17.142
{\an1}>> I'm in high school

00:17.225 --> 00:19.310
{\an1}and this is happening.

00:19.394 --> 00:22.147
{\an1}>> My momma is gonna see this.

00:22.230 --> 00:23.982
{\an1}>> Yo' grandma just flashed me,

00:24.065 --> 00:24.691
{\an1}bro.

00:24.774 --> 00:25.817
{\an1}>> This is bad.

00:25.900 --> 00:27.235
{\an1}>> MAN #1: Oh my God!

00:27.318 --> 00:30.196
{\an1}This does not stop.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.030
{\an1}I can't believe this is

00:31.114 --> 00:32.741
{\an1}happening right now.

00:32.824 --> 00:35.410
{\an1}>> Are you out of your mind?

00:35.493 --> 00:40.749
{\an1}>> [sirens]

00:40.832 --> 00:45.754
{\an1}>> [electronic music]

00:45.837 --> 00:47.881
{\an1}>> Okay, so this story takes

00:47.964 --> 00:50.425
{\an1}place about two summers ago so

00:50.508 --> 00:52.218
{\an1}listen closely because there's

00:52.302 --> 00:52.594
{\an1}a lot of details

00:52.677 --> 00:54.262
{\an1}and it comes quick.

00:54.345 --> 00:55.680
{\an1}So our buddy, Rob, throws a

00:55.764 --> 00:57.223
{\an1}theme party almost every,

00:57.307 --> 00:58.183
{\an1}every weekend.

00:58.266 --> 00:59.434
{\an1}It's a blue themed party

00:59.517 --> 01:01.102
{\an1}so we decided to go--

01:01.186 --> 01:01.895
{\an1}>> Blue Man Group.

01:01.978 --> 01:03.480
{\an1}>> --as Blue Man Group.

01:03.563 --> 01:05.272
{\an1}>> MAN #2: And our buddy took

01:05.355 --> 01:06.399
{\an1}out a big vodka bottle--

01:06.483 --> 01:07.108
{\an1}>> MAN #3: And we started

01:07.192 --> 01:07.776
{\an1}drinking shots.

01:07.859 --> 01:08.526
{\an1}>> And it wasn't like, uh...

01:08.610 --> 01:09.486
{\an1}>> This was cheap stuff.

01:09.569 --> 01:10.236
{\an1}>> It was lower than the lower.

01:10.320 --> 01:10.904
{\an1}>> This was cheap.

01:10.987 --> 01:11.613
{\an1}This is where it starts

01:11.696 --> 01:12.489
{\an1}to go hazy.

01:12.572 --> 01:13.823
{\an1}So I got up on the table

01:13.907 --> 01:15.158
{\an1}and started reciting Training

01:15.241 --> 01:16.242
{\an1}Day lines.

01:16.326 --> 01:19.287
{\an1}"King Kong ain't got [bleep]

01:19.370 --> 01:20.538
{\an1}on me!"

01:20.622 --> 01:21.873
{\an1}>> Our pre-game rituals was

01:21.956 --> 01:22.832
{\an1}watch Training Day because it

01:22.916 --> 01:24.334
{\an1}just hypes us up and this is

01:24.417 --> 01:27.629
{\an1}where I lost Ryan for about 10

01:27.712 --> 01:30.089
{\an1}minutes and I find him on the

01:30.173 --> 01:32.050
{\an1}dance floor and he's on the wall

01:32.133 --> 01:33.092
{\an1}dancing with his girl.

01:33.176 --> 01:34.135
{\an1}>> RYAN: No.

01:34.219 --> 01:35.428
{\an1}>> She is massive.

01:35.512 --> 01:36.679
{\an1}She's not just big, she's big,

01:36.763 --> 01:37.847
{\an1}big, and I'm pretty sure

01:37.931 --> 01:38.890
{\an1}her name was Rhonda.

01:38.973 --> 01:40.225
{\an1}>> No, it was not Rhonda.

01:40.308 --> 01:41.059
{\an1}>> And, um, I'm looking

01:41.142 --> 01:41.810
{\an1}and I'm listening.

01:41.893 --> 01:42.644
{\an1}I'm getting closer and I'm

01:42.727 --> 01:44.145
{\an1}hearing what he's saying, "Oh

01:44.229 --> 01:46.397
{\an1}yeah, baby, that's all me.

01:46.481 --> 01:47.357
{\an1}That's all me."

01:47.440 --> 01:48.483
{\an1}And I'm on the ground this time,

01:48.566 --> 01:49.275
{\an1}I'm rolling.

01:49.359 --> 01:50.193
{\an1}>> This was the last thing,

01:50.276 --> 01:51.069
{\an1}pretty much, I remembered at

01:51.152 --> 01:51.986
{\an1}the night, you know because

01:52.070 --> 01:53.238
{\an1}it started to go hazy.

01:53.321 --> 01:54.364
{\an1}A beautiful girl walks.

01:54.447 --> 01:55.532
{\an1}Beautiful, the most beautiful

01:55.615 --> 01:56.533
{\an1}girl I've ever seen.

01:56.616 --> 01:57.575
{\an1}>> He walked right over to her

01:57.659 --> 01:58.660
{\an1}and introduces himself.

01:58.743 --> 01:59.953
{\an1}He likes to impress people

02:00.036 --> 02:01.579
{\an1}so we start taking some shots.

02:01.663 --> 02:02.205
{\an1}>> Yeah, that's true.

02:02.288 --> 02:03.331
{\an1}>> MAN #2: He gets the vodka

02:03.414 --> 02:04.249
{\an1}bottle, he tells us, "Watch

02:04.332 --> 02:05.416
{\an1}this," and I'm like, "Okay,

02:05.500 --> 02:06.292
{\an1}what is this guy going to do?"

02:06.376 --> 02:08.002
{\an1}He dives into this vodka bottle.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.378
{\an1}He comes up with the biggest

02:09.461 --> 02:10.295
{\an1}smile I have ever seen

02:10.380 --> 02:11.005
{\an1}in my life.

02:11.089 --> 02:11.798
{\an1}He pops up and he's got

02:11.881 --> 02:12.841
{\an1}no tooth.

02:12.924 --> 02:13.883
{\an1}He's got a little fragment of

02:13.967 --> 02:14.676
{\an1}a tooth left and that's it.

02:14.759 --> 02:15.134
{\an1}>> The tooth was gone!

02:15.218 --> 02:18.972
{\an1}>> He tried to open the vodka

02:19.055 --> 02:20.265
{\an1}bottle which, mind you, is a

02:20.348 --> 02:22.684
{\an1}twist off thinking that it's a

02:22.767 --> 02:23.810
{\an1}cork it's going to pop open like

02:23.893 --> 02:24.727
{\an1}some champagne bottle.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.020
{\an1}>> He wouldn't tell me!

02:26.104 --> 02:26.646
{\an1}>> No.

02:26.729 --> 02:27.438
{\an1}>> He didn't tell me that

02:27.522 --> 02:27.897
{\an1}the tooth was gone.

02:27.981 --> 02:28.857
{\an1}>> I wanted some entertainment.

02:28.940 --> 02:29.691
{\an1}>> So I'm going around the party

02:29.774 --> 02:30.775
{\an1}I'm talking-I'm continuing to

02:30.859 --> 02:32.819
{\an1}talk to this with no tooth

02:32.902 --> 02:33.862
{\an1}in my mouth, I'm dancing--

02:33.945 --> 02:34.779
{\an1}>> Of all nights, too, he's the

02:34.863 --> 02:35.738
{\an1}most social I've ever seen him.

02:35.822 --> 02:36.406
{\an1}He's just-the biggest wide smile

02:36.489 --> 02:38.366
{\an1}I've ever seen and our closest

02:38.449 --> 02:39.576
{\an1}friends, I mean, they wanted to

02:39.659 --> 02:40.869
{\an1}tell him, but I was like, "Nah,

02:40.952 --> 02:41.870
{\an1}why don't we just let this ride

02:41.953 --> 02:42.412
{\an1}out and see what happens."

02:42.495 --> 02:44.414
{\an1}So I'm looking at this kid,

02:44.497 --> 02:45.707
{\an1}he's blue--

02:45.790 --> 02:46.791
{\an1}>> "He's blue.

02:46.875 --> 02:47.417
{\an1}He's blue."

02:47.500 --> 02:48.293
{\an1}>> He's sweatin', he's got a

02:48.376 --> 02:49.294
{\an1}raspy voice from yelling Denzel

02:49.377 --> 02:50.420
{\an1}lines all night.

02:50.503 --> 02:52.005
{\an1}>> "You think you can do this

02:52.088 --> 02:53.715
{\an1}[bleep] to me?

02:53.798 --> 02:56.509
{\an1}I run [bleep] here,

02:56.593 --> 02:58.136
{\an1}you just live here!"

02:58.219 --> 02:59.596
{\an1}At what point did I pass out?

02:59.679 --> 03:00.305
{\an1}Because I passed out,

03:00.388 --> 03:01.014
{\an1}that I remember.

03:01.097 --> 03:01.848
{\an1}>> Oh no, you passed out but

03:01.931 --> 03:02.682
{\an1}that was-we still did

03:02.765 --> 03:03.641
{\an1}some more shots.

03:03.725 --> 03:04.350
{\an1}>> Oh we did?

03:04.434 --> 03:05.518
{\an1}>> MAN #2: I'm not sure how this

03:05.602 --> 03:06.936
{\an1}is possible but this is when he

03:07.020 --> 03:09.188
{\an1}gets that girl's number.

03:09.272 --> 03:09.856
{\an1}>> RYAN: I told--

03:09.939 --> 03:10.899
{\an1}>> MAN #2: Yeah, you came up

03:10.982 --> 03:12.025
{\an1}to me and you showed me.

03:12.108 --> 03:12.650
{\an1}I'm surprised you even knew how

03:12.734 --> 03:14.527
{\an1}to, to slide your phone on.

03:14.611 --> 03:15.987
{\an1}>> I wake up the next morning on

03:16.070 --> 03:17.447
{\an1}the living room floor in nothing

03:17.530 --> 03:20.283
{\an1}but my shoes and my boxers, but

03:20.366 --> 03:22.076
{\an1}because my shoes were still on

03:22.160 --> 03:25.079
{\an1}these [bleep] wrote all over me.

03:25.163 --> 03:25.914
{\an1}>> MAN #2: With a Sharpie.

03:25.997 --> 03:27.999
{\an1}>> RYAN: Just penises all over

03:28.082 --> 03:29.250
{\an1}my arm, my face--

03:29.334 --> 03:29.959
{\an1}They drew one going

03:30.043 --> 03:30.793
{\an1}into my mouth.

03:30.877 --> 03:33.004
{\an1}I look up, I see gimmoke

03:33.087 --> 03:34.881
{\an1}and he says, "Go upstairs,

03:34.964 --> 03:35.798
{\an1}look in the mirror."

03:35.882 --> 03:36.925
{\an1}>> And all of a sudden I hear

03:37.008 --> 03:38.092
{\an1}the biggest scream.

03:38.176 --> 03:39.928
{\an1}>> [screams]

03:40.011 --> 03:41.554
{\an1}>> RYAN: My tooth was gone.

03:41.638 --> 03:42.805
{\an1}It was outrageous, but I think

03:42.889 --> 03:44.807
{\an1}the best part was that when I

03:44.891 --> 03:46.851
{\an1}did realize I had the girl's

03:46.935 --> 03:48.478
{\an1}number in my phone we ended

03:48.561 --> 03:49.896
{\an1}going out to breakfast.

03:49.979 --> 03:51.397
{\an1}>> I have no idea

03:51.481 --> 03:52.398
{\an1}how that happened.

03:52.482 --> 03:53.775
{\an1}>> Yes, I managed to do that.

03:53.858 --> 03:55.568
{\an1}I managed to do it and as I meet

03:55.652 --> 03:57.445
{\an1}her at the restaurant this girl

03:57.528 --> 03:59.572
{\an1}throws me a box of Chiclets

03:59.656 --> 04:00.448
{\an1}>> She threw you Chiclets?

04:00.531 --> 04:01.407
{\an1}>> She just threw the box at-I

04:01.491 --> 04:01.824
{\an1}don't think I ever

04:01.908 --> 04:02.951
{\an1}told you that.

04:03.034 --> 04:03.868
{\an1}I know it was embarrassing.

04:03.952 --> 04:04.869
{\an1}It was a fail, but it was a

04:04.953 --> 04:05.954
{\an1}success, right?

04:06.037 --> 04:07.455
{\an1}From one negative comes a

04:07.538 --> 04:08.081
{\an1}positive.

04:08.164 --> 04:08.957
{\an1}>> More of a fail, but yeah.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.500
{\an1}>> But it's, I mean--but you

04:10.583 --> 04:11.417
{\an1}lose and you gain so it's the

04:11.501 --> 04:12.502
{\an1}same thing.

04:12.585 --> 04:13.294
{\an1}>> It's like a--

04:13.378 --> 04:14.837
{\an1}>> RAPPER #1: â™ª At the carwash â™ª

04:14.921 --> 04:15.630
{\an1}â™ª We be fly for nothin' â™ª

04:15.713 --> 04:16.255
{\an1}>> RAPPER #2:

04:16.339 --> 04:17.257
{\an1}â™ª Have you fly for nothin' â™ª

04:17.339 --> 04:19.050
{\an1}â™ª I roll with O-G-E â™ª

04:19.132 --> 04:20.301
{\an1}â™ª -- Coppin' that profit â™ª

04:20.385 --> 04:22.095
{\an1}â™ª We call that O-P-P â™ª

04:22.178 --> 04:22.887
{\an1}â™ª Tell them tap it â™ª

04:22.971 --> 04:23.638
{\an1}â™ª Then wax it â™ª

04:23.721 --> 04:24.847
{\an1}â™ª Like he got O-C-D â™ª

04:24.931 --> 04:25.807
{\an1}â™ª And I keep a ratchet â™ª

04:25.890 --> 04:26.599

{\an1}â™ª Pop a tag at the mall â™ªâ™ª

04:33.189 --> 04:34.816
{\an1}>> â™ª

04:38.569 --> 04:39.654
{\an1}>> I had just started working at

04:39.737 --> 04:40.613
{\an1}this pizza place.

04:40.697 --> 04:41.698
{\an1}It was my second night.

04:41.781 --> 04:43.449
{\an1}It's 3:30 so I pull up at the

04:43.533 --> 04:44.659
{\an1}apartment complex, three girls

04:44.742 --> 04:45.702
{\an1}come out, "Awesome, like,

04:45.785 --> 04:46.536
{\an1}you're here.

04:46.619 --> 04:47.370
{\an1}We're super stoked, like, we're

04:47.453 --> 04:48.371
{\an1}ready for you upstairs.

04:48.454 --> 04:49.998
{\an1}Like come up with us."

04:50.081 --> 04:50.790
{\an1}"Wait, what?

04:50.873 --> 04:52.542
{\an1}Like, I just have your pizza."

04:52.625 --> 04:53.376
{\an1}Like what are you talking about?

04:53.459 --> 04:54.836
{\an1}"You actually brought a pizza?"

04:54.919 --> 04:55.837
{\an1}"Like, uh, what was I supposed

04:55.920 --> 04:56.671
{\an1}to bring?"

04:56.754 --> 04:57.380
{\an1}"Just come up with us."

04:57.463 --> 04:58.464
{\an1}"Okay."

04:58.548 --> 04:59.382
{\an1}They opened the door and like

04:59.465 --> 05:00.466
{\an1}all of a sudden there's just

05:00.550 --> 05:01.259
{\an1}like a room full of chicks,

05:01.342 --> 05:04.345
{\an1}like, about 15, 20 girls then I

05:04.429 --> 05:06.431
{\an1}saw it was like clearly a party,

05:06.514 --> 05:07.890
{\an1}a bachelorette party.

05:07.974 --> 05:10.435
{\an1}Hey, guys, the stripper's here.

05:10.518 --> 05:11.269
{\an1}Oh, [bleep]!

05:11.352 --> 05:13.771
{\an1}They think I'm a stripper.

05:13.855 --> 05:14.772
{\an1}It's like the angel and the

05:14.856 --> 05:15.690
{\an1}devil.

05:15.773 --> 05:17.066
{\an1}And the angel's just like, "They

05:17.150 --> 05:18.359
{\an1}think you're someone else.

05:18.443 --> 05:19.527
{\an1}You should really just leave the

05:19.610 --> 05:20.653
{\an1}pizzas and go back.

05:20.737 --> 05:21.237
{\an1}You should finish your job."

05:21.320 --> 05:23.239
{\an1}And the devil's just like, "Bro,

05:23.322 --> 05:25.533
{\an1}how often do you get to be the

05:25.616 --> 05:26.325
{\an1}only dude in a room full of

05:26.409 --> 05:28.119
{\an1}girls?"

05:28.202 --> 05:28.745
{\an1}And I was just like, "He does

05:28.828 --> 05:32.415
{\an1}make a good argument."

05:32.498 --> 05:32.582
{\an1}Yeah.

05:32.665 --> 05:34.459
{\an1}And then all of a sudden, "I'm

05:34.542 --> 05:36.002
{\an1}Sexy Back" comes on.

05:36.085 --> 05:37.128
{\an1}All the girls are cheering, they

05:37.211 --> 05:39.005
{\an1}push the bachelorette up in the

05:39.088 --> 05:39.255
{\an1}chair.

05:39.338 --> 05:41.549
{\an1}I take my shirt off, start

05:41.632 --> 05:43.176
{\an1}giving this girl a lap dance,

05:43.259 --> 05:44.052
{\an1}and all of a sudden all the

05:44.135 --> 05:45.636
{\an1}girls just pull out freezer bags

05:45.720 --> 05:47.430
{\an1}filled with dollar bills making

05:47.513 --> 05:48.431
{\an1}it rain.

05:48.514 --> 05:49.640
{\an1}So, I take the pants off 'cause

05:49.724 --> 05:51.017
{\an1}I'm just like, you know, we're

05:51.100 --> 05:51.893
{\an1}escalating this.

05:51.976 --> 05:52.852
{\an1}We're pushing it, like, let's

05:52.935 --> 05:53.853
{\an1}just see where it goes.

05:53.936 --> 05:54.896
{\an1}All of a sudden she throws a

05:54.979 --> 05:55.938
{\an1}curve ball, "Have you ever been

05:56.022 --> 05:57.690
{\an1}with a 30-year-old?"

05:57.774 --> 05:58.316
{\an1}What?

05:58.399 --> 06:01.152
{\an1}So she pulls me away into a

06:01.235 --> 06:03.029
{\an1}room, we're about to actually

06:03.112 --> 06:03.988
{\an1}hook up.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.823
{\an1}The devil's doing a little bop

06:05.907 --> 06:07.116
{\an1}dance just like this and all of

06:07.200 --> 06:08.910
{\an1}a sudden the music stops.

06:08.993 --> 06:10.036
{\an1}One of the girls goes, "Hey,

06:10.119 --> 06:11.162
{\an1}could you guys come out here for

06:11.245 --> 06:12.622
{\an1}a second?"

06:12.705 --> 06:14.540
{\an1}And there's this big tall dude,

06:14.624 --> 06:16.125
{\an1}kind of buff, he looks like a

06:16.209 --> 06:16.417
{\an1}stripper.

06:16.501 --> 06:19.420
{\an1}Uh, I was scared that the other

06:19.504 --> 06:20.588
{\an1}guy was going to fight me,

06:20.671 --> 06:21.839
{\an1}more that the girls were going

06:21.923 --> 06:22.548
{\an1}to fight me.

06:22.632 --> 06:23.132
{\an1}Girls are vicious especially

06:23.216 --> 06:24.509
{\an1}like a pack of them and they're

06:24.592 --> 06:25.843
{\an1}drunk.

06:25.927 --> 06:27.053
{\an1}So, one girl, she looks back at

06:27.136 --> 06:28.387
{\an1}me and she says, "So, this guy

06:28.471 --> 06:30.932
{\an1}is the stripper.

06:31.015 --> 06:32.141
{\an1}Who are you?"

06:32.225 --> 06:33.434
{\an1}All eyes just went from here to

06:33.518 --> 06:35.144
{\an1}right on me.

06:35.228 --> 06:35.394
{\an1}Uhh.

06:35.478 --> 06:38.564
{\an1}>> [dramatic music]

06:38.648 --> 06:39.482
{\an1}>> And I was just like, "The

06:39.565 --> 06:40.525
{\an1}pizza's on me."

06:40.608 --> 06:41.692
{\an1}And I just ran out of the house,

06:41.776 --> 06:43.027
{\an1}left my shirt, left my shorts

06:43.111 --> 06:43.486
{\an1}there, found my keys,

06:43.569 --> 06:46.072
{\an1}and just dipped.

06:46.155 --> 06:47.657
{\an1}I just told my co-workers

06:47.740 --> 06:48.449
{\an1}what happened.

06:48.533 --> 06:48.991
{\an1}They weren't that surprised

06:49.075 --> 06:50.243
{\an1}by it.

06:50.326 --> 06:51.536
{\an1}Apparently they have hooked up

06:51.619 --> 06:55.832
{\an1}with women on deliveries before.

06:55.915 --> 06:59.836
{\an1}>> [Tropical music]

06:59.919 --> 07:00.795
{\an1}>> So, me and my friends have

07:00.878 --> 07:01.879
{\an1}been planning this trip to Guam

07:01.963 --> 07:03.589
{\an1}for a long time.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.216
{\an1}So, Guam is an island which is

07:05.299 --> 07:06.592
{\an1}about four hours from Hawaii and

07:06.676 --> 07:07.885
{\an1}four hours from Japan and I'd

07:07.969 --> 07:09.095
{\an1}never been outside of Delaware

07:09.178 --> 07:10.721
{\an1}at the time, and as soon as we

07:10.805 --> 07:11.347
{\an1}had gotten there we got a call

07:11.430 --> 07:13.724
{\an1}from one of my friends, "Let's

07:13.808 --> 07:15.601
{\an1}go to this party in the woods."

07:15.685 --> 07:16.435
{\an1}So, we started driving into the

07:16.519 --> 07:19.605
{\an1}woods, it's pitch black, there's

07:19.689 --> 07:19.856
{\an1}no lights.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.274
{\an1}I'm scared a deer's going to

07:21.357 --> 07:22.692
{\an1}jump in front or Big Foot's

07:22.775 --> 07:23.609
{\an1}going to walk walk across

07:23.693 --> 07:24.152
{\an1}and it's going to go threw

07:24.235 --> 07:25.194
{\an1}the windshield.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.070
{\an1}>> [roaring]

07:26.154 --> 07:26.904
{\an1}>> So, we turn around and go,

07:26.988 --> 07:27.697
{\an1}"Money!

07:27.780 --> 07:28.656
{\an1}These people got money!"

07:28.739 --> 07:30.324
{\an1}This house was huge!

07:30.408 --> 07:31.576
{\an1}I feel like the hood going into

07:31.659 --> 07:32.493
{\an1}this house.

07:32.577 --> 07:33.828
{\an1}I mean, nobody looked basic

07:33.911 --> 07:35.037
{\an1}there but this.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.664
{\an1}Everybody was nice and I don't

07:36.747 --> 07:37.665
{\an1}care what I look.

07:37.748 --> 07:39.000
{\an1}Like, [bleep], I'm here to have

07:39.083 --> 07:40.168
{\an1}fun, [bleep] everybody else.

07:40.251 --> 07:41.335
{\an1}This ain't no fashion show.

07:41.419 --> 07:42.295
{\an1}The party is killing, there's

07:42.378 --> 07:43.754
{\an1}thousands of people there.

07:43.838 --> 07:45.131
{\an1}Stuff was catching on fire,

07:45.214 --> 07:46.924
{\an1}people were jumping in the pool.

07:47.008 --> 07:47.967
{\an1}There was somebody literally

07:48.050 --> 07:49.552
{\an1}swinging from the chandelier.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.262
{\an1}And then some girl actually had

07:51.345 --> 07:53.681
{\an1}threw up in the fruit punch like

07:53.764 --> 07:54.599
{\an1}the Exorcist.

07:54.682 --> 07:55.558
{\an1}I was about to throw up,

07:55.641 --> 07:56.601
{\an1}everybody about to throw up.

07:56.684 --> 07:57.226
{\an1}And then somebody came in and

07:57.310 --> 07:59.520
{\an1}drunk the fruit punch.

07:59.604 --> 08:00.396
{\an1}"Mm, it's good."

08:00.479 --> 08:03.983
{\an1}I'm like, "That is disgusting!"

08:04.066 --> 08:05.276
{\an1}How can you not taste the chunks

08:05.359 --> 08:06.652
{\an1}in that?

08:06.736 --> 08:08.321
{\an1}So, suddenly I see a fight, "Oh,

08:08.404 --> 08:09.197
{\an1}oh, oh."

08:09.280 --> 08:11.240
{\an1}Like, wigs, pieces flying every

08:11.324 --> 08:12.325
{\an1}which way.

08:12.408 --> 08:12.867
{\an1}So, I grab them, starting

08:12.950 --> 08:14.619
{\an1}picking the weave pieces up and

08:14.702 --> 08:15.578
{\an1}put them in my pocket.

08:15.661 --> 08:16.204
{\an1}People are looking at me, I'm

08:16.287 --> 08:17.163
{\an1}like, "What?"

08:17.246 --> 08:18.122
{\an1}Like, I'm about to have me a

08:18.206 --> 08:19.665
{\an1}souvenir and then all we hear

08:19.749 --> 08:20.625
{\an1}is, "Boom, boom, boom."

08:20.708 --> 08:21.626
{\an1}I turn around and there's these

08:21.709 --> 08:24.086
{\an1}big police officers, like eight

08:24.170 --> 08:24.795
{\an1}of them.

08:24.879 --> 08:25.671
{\an1}Everybody was screaming,

08:25.755 --> 08:26.631
{\an1}everybody started running,

08:26.714 --> 08:27.882
{\an1}people were getting handcuffed.

08:27.965 --> 08:30.968
{\an1}I'm looking like, "Oh [bleep]!"

08:31.052 --> 08:31.969
{\an1}I'm looking at people, they got

08:32.053 --> 08:34.222
{\an1}money, they got Gucci stuff,

08:34.304 --> 08:35.597
{\an1}they got nice necklaces,

08:35.681 --> 08:36.432
{\an1}expensive stuff.

08:36.515 --> 08:40.977
{\an1}This is a drug dealer's house.

08:41.062 --> 08:42.188
{\an1}I started running.

08:42.270 --> 08:43.272
{\an1}I was running and running and

08:43.356 --> 08:43.940
{\an1}running and my phone's dead and

08:44.023 --> 08:45.399
{\an1}I couldn't find nobody.

08:45.483 --> 08:46.234
{\an1}I had nothing.

08:46.317 --> 08:47.193
{\an1}So, I 'm running so fast my

08:47.276 --> 08:48.319
{\an1}shoes even take off.

08:48.402 --> 08:49.195
{\an1}They're like, "[bleep] you!

08:49.278 --> 08:49.904
{\an1}I'm out of here."

08:49.987 --> 08:50.571
{\an1}Oh, I cussed again,

08:50.655 --> 08:53.241
{\an1}ahh-ha-ha-ha.

08:53.324 --> 08:54.951
{\an1}So I'm running!

08:55.034 --> 08:56.869
{\an1}I'm crying, "Mommy!"

08:56.953 --> 08:57.912
{\an1}I'm trying to find somewhere to

08:57.995 --> 08:58.871
{\an1}go, I need to get away from

08:58.955 --> 08:59.830
{\an1}these police and I see a

08:59.914 --> 09:00.665
{\an1}dumpster so I had to jump in

09:00.748 --> 09:02.708
{\an1}there.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.585
{\an1}It smells disgusting, but I

09:04.669 --> 09:05.711
{\an1}can't get arrested.

09:05.795 --> 09:06.837
{\an1}I'm not about to go to Guamanian

09:06.921 --> 09:08.673
{\an1}jail, no-oh.

09:08.756 --> 09:09.757
{\an1}I'm sucking my thumb like a

09:09.840 --> 09:10.716
{\an1}newborn baby.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.177
{\an1}I'm like--[whimpering].

09:13.261 --> 09:13.678
{\an1}I'm crying, everything.

09:13.761 --> 09:15.596
{\an1}I'm scared of spiders, scared of

09:15.680 --> 09:15.805
{\an1}snakes.

09:15.888 --> 09:17.640
{\an1}I'm on an exotic island, I can

09:17.723 --> 09:18.933
{\an1}only imagine what's lurking.

09:19.016 --> 09:20.268
{\an1}I'm so terrified of the dark, my

09:20.351 --> 09:21.227
{\an1}mind plays tricks on me in the

09:21.310 --> 09:22.270
{\an1}dark.

09:22.353 --> 09:23.354
{\an1}And I'm hearing somebody or

09:23.437 --> 09:25.106
{\an1}something is walking in the

09:25.189 --> 09:25.982
{\an1}woods.

09:26.065 --> 09:27.400
{\an1}I can hear the leaves crunching,

09:27.483 --> 09:29.318
{\an1}I hear an owl-type noise.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.820
{\an1}I hear stuff slither, I hear a

09:30.903 --> 09:33.197
{\an1}woodpecker.

09:33.281 --> 09:34.031
{\an1}You know when you're scared of

09:34.115 --> 09:35.032
{\an1}the dark and then you got the

09:35.116 --> 09:36.033
{\an1}blanket on top of you in your

09:36.117 --> 09:36.951
{\an1}bed, and you're like, "Yo, I'm

09:37.034 --> 09:38.327
{\an1}scared to look out this blanket.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.370
{\an1}I think I'd rather get killed in

09:39.453 --> 09:40.913
{\an1}this blanket than look at what's

09:40.997 --> 09:41.706
{\an1}killing me."

09:41.789 --> 09:42.623
{\an1}That's what it was like for me,

09:42.707 --> 09:43.958
{\an1}so I'd open it, I'd close it,

09:44.041 --> 09:46.043
{\an1}open it and close it.

09:46.127 --> 09:48.254
{\an1}And then I finally came out when

09:48.337 --> 09:50.631
{\an1}it was two hours later.

09:50.715 --> 09:51.215
{\an1}That's when mosquitoes started

09:51.299 --> 09:53.217
{\an1}jumping me.

09:53.301 --> 09:54.802
{\an1}I'm itching, screaming, cussing,

09:54.885 --> 09:56.137
{\an1}cussing at myself, cussing at

09:56.220 --> 09:57.305
{\an1}the wind, cussing at the trees.

09:57.388 --> 09:58.097
{\an1}I feel like they're all looking

09:58.180 --> 09:59.140
{\an1}at me.

09:59.223 --> 10:00.099
{\an1}I tried to back track and I

10:00.182 --> 10:00.891
{\an1}couldn't.

10:00.975 --> 10:03.019
{\an1}I had no compass, no phone, I

10:03.102 --> 10:03.811
{\an1}don't even know nothing about

10:03.894 --> 10:04.937
{\an1}the [bleep].

10:05.021 --> 10:06.022
{\an1}Oh, let me find out, there, the

10:06.105 --> 10:07.148
{\an1}Northern Lights are over there.

10:07.231 --> 10:08.065
{\an1}I don't know nothing about that

10:08.149 --> 10:08.983
{\an1}stuff.

10:09.066 --> 10:10.026
{\an1}I thought I was going to die,

10:10.109 --> 10:11.319
{\an1}like, I really felt like there

10:11.402 --> 10:12.194
{\an1}was no way I was going to get

10:12.278 --> 10:14.071
{\an1}out of here.

10:14.155 --> 10:14.613
{\an1}It turns out I ran

10:14.697 --> 10:18.117
{\an1}three minutes away.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.827
{\an1}Seriously, why was I

10:19.910 --> 10:20.786
{\an1}even running?

10:20.870 --> 10:21.203
{\an1}I could've just went

10:21.287 --> 10:22.705
{\an1}into the car.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.790
{\an1}The car was unlocked,

10:24.874 --> 10:25.833
{\an1}but whatever.

10:25.916 --> 10:27.209
{\an1}We got home, they passed out,

10:27.293 --> 10:27.752
{\an1}and I just started going ham

10:27.835 --> 10:29.420
{\an1}on food.

10:29.503 --> 10:30.296
{\an1}Just [bleep] up.

10:30.379 --> 10:31.255
{\an1}I'm eating food I don't even

10:31.339 --> 10:32.673
{\an1}like, and just eating and eating

10:32.757 --> 10:32.965
{\an1}and eating.

10:33.049 --> 10:33.549
{\an1}Get rid of this feeling I had

10:33.632 --> 10:36.135
{\an1}from being scared.

10:36.218 --> 10:37.762
{\an1}So, I made it home safe, I'm not

10:37.845 --> 10:41.432
{\an1}in Guam jail, I'm alive, and it

10:41.515 --> 10:43.059
{\an1}was the best night of my life.

10:43.142 --> 10:45.561
{\an1}>> [hip hop music]

10:47.563 --> 10:50.399
{\an1}>> â™ª

11:00.701 --> 11:03.537
{\an1}>> â™ª

11:06.665 --> 11:09.418
{\an1}>> So, my mom and I, we live in

11:09.502 --> 11:12.088
{\an1}Fort Lauderdale and my mom left

11:12.171 --> 11:13.547
{\an1}and she left her car.

11:13.631 --> 11:14.090
{\an1}My friend Brie, "Like, yo,

11:14.173 --> 11:14.757
{\an1}nothing's happening in Fort

11:14.840 --> 11:16.550
{\an1}Lauderdale.

11:16.634 --> 11:17.134
{\an1}We got to go to Miami, that's

11:17.218 --> 11:19.470
{\an1}where all the fun gets down."

11:19.553 --> 11:20.971
{\an1}I'm thinking, like, either use

11:21.055 --> 11:22.306
{\an1}my mom's car, everything will be

11:22.390 --> 11:24.392
{\an1}okay, she'll never find out.

11:24.475 --> 11:27.061
{\an1}Or she'll find out, I'll die.

11:27.144 --> 11:28.521
{\an1}So, we're in South Beach and

11:28.604 --> 11:29.105
{\an1}this idiot next to me, she's

11:29.188 --> 11:29.730
{\an1}talking all the [bleep].

11:29.814 --> 11:32.024
{\an1}You know what she's saying and I

11:32.108 --> 11:33.317
{\an1}looked over to her and I

11:33.401 --> 11:34.568
{\an1}literally hit the car in front

11:34.652 --> 11:36.445
{\an1}of me.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.239
{\an1}And I'm like, "Oh, [bleep]!"

11:38.322 --> 11:38.823
{\an1}"Yo, what did you just do?"

11:38.906 --> 11:41.033
{\an1}I'm like, "Bro, what did you

11:41.117 --> 11:42.118
{\an1}just make me do?"

11:42.201 --> 11:43.327
{\an1}"Yo, your mom's going to kill

11:43.411 --> 11:44.328
{\an1}you, son."

11:44.412 --> 11:45.496
{\an1}I'm like, "Dog, you're here with

11:45.579 --> 11:46.580
{\an1}me too.

11:46.664 --> 11:48.249
{\an1}If I die you die."

11:48.332 --> 11:48.791
{\an1}She's like, "No, it's cool.

11:48.874 --> 11:50.793
{\an1}My uncle fixes cars, he can do

11:50.876 --> 11:51.836
{\an1}it for the low, low."

11:51.919 --> 11:52.711
{\an1}So she calls him, first of all,

11:52.795 --> 11:55.005
{\an1}he says, "It's $450."

11:55.089 --> 11:56.006
{\an1}Obviously you and your uncle

11:56.090 --> 11:56.924
{\an1}don't even got a close enough

11:57.007 --> 11:57.967
{\an1}relationship 'cause he's still

11:58.050 --> 11:59.427
{\an1}charging you the high, high.

11:59.510 --> 12:00.553
{\an1}I don't have money, she doesn't

12:00.636 --> 12:01.512
{\an1}have money.

12:01.595 --> 12:02.138
{\an1}So, we're walking down the strip

12:02.221 --> 12:03.848
{\an1}and she sees this like sign.

12:03.931 --> 12:04.723
{\an1}They're having a wet T-shirt

12:04.807 --> 12:07.226
{\an1}contest.

12:07.309 --> 12:08.477
{\an1}I would never do a wet T-shirt

12:08.561 --> 12:09.437
{\an1}contest, I'm not that kind of

12:09.520 --> 12:10.479
{\an1}person.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.355
{\an1}She'll do something strange for

12:11.439 --> 12:11.981
{\an1}a piece of change, I won't do

12:12.064 --> 12:13.983
{\an1}that, that's not me.

12:14.066 --> 12:14.775
{\an1}>> â™ª

12:14.859 --> 12:16.986
{\an1}>> So, she won.

12:17.069 --> 12:17.903
{\an1}First of all, you just did a wet

12:17.987 --> 12:18.821
{\an1}T-shirt contest, you're a ho.

12:18.904 --> 12:22.116
{\an1}Second of all, you actually won.

12:22.199 --> 12:22.741
{\an1}So, I'm like, I know I act like

12:22.825 --> 12:23.784
{\an1}I hate you and I do, but right

12:23.868 --> 12:27.288
{\an1}now I freaking love you.

12:27.371 --> 12:29.623
{\an1}So now we have $310 and we're

12:29.707 --> 12:31.876
{\an1}only $140 away from our goal.

12:31.959 --> 12:34.003
{\an1}We were walking the strip

12:34.086 --> 12:35.087
{\an1}looking for more events.

12:35.171 --> 12:36.380
{\an1}So, I'm just like, "Okay, I'm

12:36.464 --> 12:37.423
{\an1}not going to do something to

12:37.506 --> 12:38.799
{\an1}embarrass myself on that Kim

12:38.883 --> 12:41.302
{\an1}Kardashian level.

12:41.385 --> 12:42.636
{\an1}So, there's a hot dog eating

12:42.720 --> 12:43.637
{\an1}contest.

12:43.721 --> 12:45.097
{\an1}So I'm eating all these hot dogs

12:45.181 --> 12:46.140
{\an1}and I'm eating and eating and

12:46.223 --> 12:46.932
{\an1}eating.

12:47.016 --> 12:47.516
{\an1}It's the most disgusting thing

12:47.600 --> 12:48.601
{\an1}in the world.

12:48.684 --> 12:49.602
{\an1}I had to do it because it was a

12:49.685 --> 12:51.604
{\an1}life or death situation.

12:51.687 --> 12:52.563
{\an1}I won that one.

12:52.646 --> 12:53.397
{\an1}I was literally the happiest

12:53.481 --> 12:54.148
{\an1}person in the world.

12:54.231 --> 12:56.984
{\an1}I puked and I vomited.

12:57.067 --> 12:57.526
{\an1}And she's like, "Yo, are you

12:57.610 --> 12:58.527
{\an1}okay?"

12:58.611 --> 12:59.361
{\an1}I'm like, "Hell yeah, I'm okay.

12:59.445 --> 13:00.404
{\an1}I just won $100."

13:00.488 --> 13:02.031
{\an1}So now we're at $410, all we

13:02.114 --> 13:03.616
{\an1}need is $40 and we're 100

13:03.699 --> 13:06.160
{\an1}percent solid.

13:06.243 --> 13:07.286
{\an1}She's like, "Listen, we got to

13:07.369 --> 13:08.370
{\an1}ask people for money."

13:08.454 --> 13:09.330
{\an1}So I'm like maybe we could say

13:09.413 --> 13:11.123
{\an1}we're from out of town, we're

13:11.207 --> 13:12.458
{\an1}from London.

13:12.541 --> 13:13.292
{\an1}[British accent]: We're lost, we

13:13.375 --> 13:14.460
{\an1}lost all our money.

13:14.543 --> 13:15.461
{\an1}[Jamaican accent]: We come from

13:15.544 --> 13:16.086
{\an1}Jamaica, we have no money left.

13:16.170 --> 13:16.837
{\an1}[Irish accent]: Oh, laddie,

13:16.921 --> 13:19.507
{\an1}please give us a little change.

13:19.590 --> 13:20.591
{\an1}And we're like, "That sounds way

13:20.674 --> 13:24.970
{\an1}more Caribbean than Irish.

13:25.054 --> 13:26.388
{\an1}>> So, we had the money and we

13:26.472 --> 13:27.473
{\an1}got it fixed.

13:27.556 --> 13:28.682
{\an1}It took like literally three

13:28.766 --> 13:29.808
{\an1}hours and I was really scared

13:29.892 --> 13:30.726
{\an1}because I was like my mom comes

13:30.809 --> 13:34.104
{\an1}home and she doesn't see her car

13:34.188 --> 13:35.481
{\an1}there it's going to be over.

13:35.564 --> 13:37.149
{\an1}I'm literally racing home fast

13:37.233 --> 13:38.901
{\an1}and furious.

13:38.984 --> 13:39.944
{\an1}Made sure everything was

13:40.027 --> 13:43.447
{\an1}perfect, sat down on the couch.

13:43.531 --> 13:44.073
{\an1}My mom got home and everything

13:44.156 --> 13:48.327
{\an1}was great and she never knew

13:48.410 --> 13:51.580
{\an1}until like maybe this show airs.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.166
{\an1}>> â™ª

13:54.250 --> 13:57.503
{\an1}>> [rock music]

13:57.586 --> 13:59.004
{\an1}>> Okay, so I was a beach life

13:59.088 --> 14:00.089
{\an1}guard in my summers in between

14:00.172 --> 14:00.756
{\an1}college and all of the veteran

14:00.839 --> 14:02.841
{\an1}life guards go to this one bar,

14:02.925 --> 14:03.884
{\an1}it's a party bar, and they drink

14:03.968 --> 14:07.179
{\an1}this special drink called Raging

14:07.263 --> 14:07.972
{\an1}Bulls.

14:08.055 --> 14:10.182
{\an1}It's known to get them [bleep]

14:10.266 --> 14:11.600
{\an1}up.

14:11.684 --> 14:14.478
{\an1}So, on my 21st birthday all the

14:14.562 --> 14:15.479
{\an1}veteran guards are like, "You

14:15.563 --> 14:16.105
{\an1}got to come out and we'll show

14:16.188 --> 14:16.981
{\an1}you around."

14:17.064 --> 14:19.275
{\an1}Of course, I need to go, show

14:19.358 --> 14:22.236
{\an1}these guys I can hang with.

14:22.319 --> 14:22.861
{\an1}I get to this crazy bar.

14:22.945 --> 14:25.739
{\an1}My boy Kentucky Fried gives me

14:25.823 --> 14:27.157
{\an1}my first Raging Bull.

14:27.241 --> 14:28.742
{\an1}I was like, all right, I'm 21,

14:28.826 --> 14:29.743
{\an1}bitches!

14:29.827 --> 14:30.286
{\an1}I was potting the cups like,

14:30.369 --> 14:33.789
{\an1}"Boom, boom, boom!"

14:33.872 --> 14:36.959
{\an1}And then pure darkness.

14:37.042 --> 14:39.878
{\an1}Lights out, no memory, nothing.

14:39.962 --> 14:41.797
{\an1}I wake up, it's hot as hell, I'm

14:41.880 --> 14:44.425
{\an1}sweating, and I'm wet.

14:44.508 --> 14:46.760
{\an1}My headache is screeching and

14:46.844 --> 14:49.013
{\an1}it's super-super painful.

14:49.096 --> 14:50.973
{\an1}And I look around and I just see

14:51.056 --> 14:53.017
{\an1}a stark white room with no

14:53.100 --> 14:55.853
{\an1}widows, and one door with bars

14:55.936 --> 14:57.646
{\an1}on it.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.690
{\an1}I'm like where am I?

14:59.773 --> 15:01.066
{\an1}>> â™ª

15:01.150 --> 15:03.110
{\an1}>> I look around and I see these

15:03.193 --> 15:05.321
{\an1}big rough scary guys that have

15:05.404 --> 15:06.488
{\an1}probably killed a few people to

15:06.572 --> 15:07.114
{\an1}be initiated, and when they look

15:07.197 --> 15:09.283
{\an1}at me they probably see this

15:09.366 --> 15:09.825
{\an1}little momma's boy wearing a

15:09.908 --> 15:12.870
{\an1}teal Polo with pink shorts and

15:12.953 --> 15:15.539
{\an1}preppy little flip flops.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.291
{\an1}So I go, "Hi, I'm Taylor."

15:17.374 --> 15:18.542
{\an1}"I'm Buck."

15:18.626 --> 15:19.668
{\an1}It's my birthday and I don't

15:19.752 --> 15:21.420
{\an1}know how I got here.

15:21.503 --> 15:23.213
{\an1}You're in the drunk tank.

15:23.297 --> 15:24.256
{\an1}"And you don't want to mess with

15:24.340 --> 15:25.633
{\an1}any of these people so I woulds

15:25.716 --> 15:27.635
{\an1}stop talking if I were you."

15:27.718 --> 15:28.636
{\an1}At that point I'm kind of like,

15:28.719 --> 15:30.262
{\an1}"Oh, yes, I'm stoked.

15:30.346 --> 15:30.929
{\an1}I partied so hard I made it to

15:31.013 --> 15:35.017
{\an1}the drunk tank!"

15:35.100 --> 15:37.436
{\an1}So I was like okay, well, he

15:37.519 --> 15:38.020
{\an1}could obviously beat me up so

15:38.103 --> 15:41.148
{\an1}I'm not going to go there.

15:41.231 --> 15:43.108
{\an1}I'm going to go try to get

15:43.192 --> 15:43.400
{\an1}some water.

15:43.484 --> 15:44.068
{\an1}There was a water fountain and a

15:44.151 --> 15:46.779
{\an1}toilet in the room, but in

15:46.862 --> 15:48.322
{\an1}between that water fountain and

15:48.405 --> 15:50.616
{\an1}toilet there was a dude with

15:50.699 --> 15:51.867
{\an1}sevens all over his body.

15:51.950 --> 15:53.786
{\an1}We're just going to call him

15:53.869 --> 15:54.787
{\an1}lucky.

15:54.870 --> 15:56.413
{\an1}I get about five feet away and

15:56.497 --> 16:01.168
{\an1}then all of a sudden roaring at

16:01.251 --> 16:03.253
{\an1}me claiming it's his water

16:03.337 --> 16:04.129
{\an1}fountain.

16:04.213 --> 16:05.631
{\an1}So I regain my composure and go

16:05.714 --> 16:07.257
{\an1}quickly back to Buck.

16:07.341 --> 16:08.801
{\an1}So I'm feeling lost and alone.

16:08.884 --> 16:10.552
{\an1}I looked over at Buck and

16:10.636 --> 16:13.180
{\an1}noticed one of his tattoos.

16:13.263 --> 16:14.556
{\an1}I reached out at that point and

16:14.640 --> 16:15.140
{\an1}told him how much I liked it.

16:15.224 --> 16:19.978
{\an1}Buck was like, "Oh, thanks."

16:20.062 --> 16:22.398
{\an1}And then the next thing you know

16:22.481 --> 16:23.399
{\an1}we're bros.

16:23.482 --> 16:24.024
{\an1}By the end of it the fun police

16:24.108 --> 16:26.485
{\an1}comes to the door, "Come on,

16:26.568 --> 16:27.361
{\an1}fellas.

16:27.444 --> 16:28.696
{\an1}It's time to face the judge."

16:28.779 --> 16:30.155
{\an1}The judge asks me, "State your

16:30.239 --> 16:31.740
{\an1}name and date of birth."

16:31.824 --> 16:33.492
{\an1}I said, "Taylor Shank, May 19th,

16:33.575 --> 16:34.576
{\an1}1990."

16:34.660 --> 16:35.994
{\an1}And he raised his left eyebrow.

16:36.078 --> 16:40.290
{\an1}"Oh, happy birthday, Taylor.

16:40.374 --> 16:41.542
{\an1}Think you learned your lesson?"

16:41.625 --> 16:42.042
{\an1}I was like, "Yes, sir."

16:42.126 --> 16:45.087
{\an1}The judge tells me, "You're free

16:45.170 --> 16:47.339
{\an1}to go, son."

16:47.423 --> 16:48.716
{\an1}Woo.

16:48.799 --> 16:50.300
{\an1}Celebrating my 21st birthday and

16:50.384 --> 16:52.678
{\an1}then waking up in jail with 11

16:52.761 --> 16:55.222
{\an1}other bikers was probably one of

16:55.305 --> 16:57.433
{\an1}the scariest yet coolest moments

17:03.564 --> 17:04.982
{\an1}continues now.

17:05.065 --> 17:10.069
{\an1}>> â™ª

17:12.239 --> 17:13.031
{\an1}>> My brother and I play in a

17:13.115 --> 17:15.492
{\an1}Calypso Punk Rock-type of band

17:15.576 --> 17:16.160
{\an1}and we try to play a show once,

17:16.242 --> 17:18.328
{\an1}twice every week.

17:18.412 --> 17:19.829
{\an1}A couple years ago we played a

17:19.913 --> 17:20.455
{\an1}show in Queens which was really

17:20.539 --> 17:22.499
{\an1}cool because we are only five

17:22.583 --> 17:23.625
{\an1}minutes away from my parents

17:23.709 --> 17:24.501
{\an1}house.

17:24.585 --> 17:25.586
{\an1}So we got carloads of people

17:25.669 --> 17:26.920
{\an1}coming in, kegs flowing, the

17:27.003 --> 17:27.796
{\an1}deck is filled.

17:27.880 --> 17:28.756
{\an1}Upstairs is full, basement's

17:28.839 --> 17:30.424
{\an1}full, my parents were upstairs,

17:30.507 --> 17:31.800
{\an1}so after a while people get

17:31.884 --> 17:32.718
{\an1}hungry.

17:32.801 --> 17:33.302
{\an1}So, we call up this place, we

17:33.385 --> 17:35.095
{\an1}order 20, 25 of the craziest

17:35.179 --> 17:37.431
{\an1}sandwiches you can imagine,

17:37.514 --> 17:39.683
{\an1}mozzarella sticks, french fries,

17:39.767 --> 17:40.476
{\an1}pretzels.

17:40.559 --> 17:41.310
{\an1}Forty-five minutes, an hour

17:41.393 --> 17:42.102
{\an1}later everything comes except

17:42.186 --> 17:44.646
{\an1}for this one kid's mozzarella

17:44.730 --> 17:45.522
{\an1}sticks.

17:45.606 --> 17:46.565
{\an1}We call it the mootzies, and not

17:46.648 --> 17:47.149
{\an1}even like that, "Moot-zies,"

17:47.232 --> 17:48.192
{\an1}like that, "Moot-zies."

17:48.275 --> 17:49.193
{\an1}And so, unbeknownst to my

17:49.276 --> 17:52.488
{\an1}brother and I he takes a phone

17:52.571 --> 17:53.113
{\an1}and he calls up the deli and he

17:53.197 --> 17:55.532
{\an1}starts talking trash being like,

17:55.616 --> 17:56.742
{\an1}"Yo, you guys forgot my

17:56.825 --> 17:57.326
{\an1}mootzies, I'm going to come to

17:57.409 --> 17:57.993
{\an1}that place, I'm going to break

17:58.076 --> 17:59.870
{\an1}all the windows.

17:59.953 --> 18:00.579
{\an1}I'm going to throw [bleep] all

18:00.662 --> 18:01.538
{\an1}over the walls, I'm going to

18:01.622 --> 18:02.748
{\an1}break all of the glass that

18:02.831 --> 18:03.665
{\an1}holds the meats.

18:03.749 --> 18:04.541
{\an1}I'm going to tear it up.

18:04.625 --> 18:05.167
{\an1}He's like, "Yeah, where are

18:05.250 --> 18:05.834
{\an1}you?"

18:05.918 --> 18:06.502
{\an1}And my friend's like, "Oh,

18:06.585 --> 18:06.668
{\an1}okay."

18:06.752 --> 18:08.003
{\an1}And he gives my address, and he

18:08.086 --> 18:09.505
{\an1}says, "I got a knife tucked

18:09.588 --> 18:10.047
{\an1}behind my pants.

18:10.130 --> 18:10.547
{\an1}You want to come see me?

18:10.631 --> 18:12.174
{\an1}You come see me."

18:12.257 --> 18:13.091
{\an1}Twenty-five minutes later people

18:13.175 --> 18:14.051
{\an1}are going in and out now.

18:14.134 --> 18:15.928
{\an1}Some people are checking on

18:16.011 --> 18:16.553
{\an1}their cars, people are leaving,

18:16.637 --> 18:17.888
{\an1}I'm not paying attention.

18:17.971 --> 18:19.389
{\an1}So, I hear a, "Bang, bang, bang,

18:19.473 --> 18:19.681
{\an1}bang, bang!"

18:19.765 --> 18:20.265
{\an1}I have wooden doors so it's

18:20.349 --> 18:21.099
{\an1}super-duper deep, the whole

18:21.183 --> 18:23.018
{\an1}house rocks.

18:23.101 --> 18:24.812
{\an1}So I open the door, staring me

18:24.895 --> 18:26.605
{\an1}in the face is the biggest gun I

18:26.688 --> 18:28.023
{\an1}have ever seen in my life.

18:28.106 --> 18:29.983
{\an1}He didn't pull it out, it was

18:30.067 --> 18:30.859
{\an1}out all ready.

18:30.943 --> 18:31.735
{\an1}I'm like, "Dude, what's going

18:31.819 --> 18:32.402
{\an1}on?

18:32.486 --> 18:33.028
{\an1}Man, what's going on?"

18:33.111 --> 18:33.654
{\an1}He's like, "Well, someone just

18:33.737 --> 18:34.279
{\an1}called my restaurant talking all

18:34.363 --> 18:36.073
{\an1}this smack and I want some

18:36.156 --> 18:36.365
{\an1}answers."

18:36.448 --> 18:37.074
{\an1}Well, I was like, "Dude, I

18:37.157 --> 18:38.116
{\an1}didn't call you and my brother

18:38.200 --> 18:39.034
{\an1}definitely didn't call you."

18:39.117 --> 18:40.744
{\an1}So I was like, "Call the number

18:40.828 --> 18:42.079
{\an1}of the cell phone that called

18:42.162 --> 18:42.955
{\an1}you."

18:43.038 --> 18:43.664
{\an1}He's like, "Okay, I'm going to

18:43.747 --> 18:44.081
{\an1}call it."

18:44.164 --> 18:44.706
{\an1}And then all of a sudden we hear

18:44.790 --> 18:47.376
{\an1}this vibrating buzz, buzz.

18:47.459 --> 18:48.126
{\an1}And then like a carousel-type

18:48.210 --> 18:52.089
{\an1}ring like-- [melodic humming]

18:52.172 --> 18:53.799
{\an1}And we look over and it's just

18:53.882 --> 18:55.008
{\an1}the littlest kid in the party.

18:55.092 --> 18:56.426
{\an1}He must've been twice or three

18:56.510 --> 18:57.845
{\an1}times the size of the sandwich

18:57.928 --> 18:58.804
{\an1}that he just ate, literally.

18:58.887 --> 18:59.680
{\an1}This little, little kid in the

18:59.763 --> 19:01.682
{\an1}corner and he swings the gun and

19:01.765 --> 19:02.516
{\an1}looks at this kid.

19:02.599 --> 19:03.475
{\an1}He's like, "What's up?"

19:03.559 --> 19:04.101
{\an1}And he gets ghost white, I'm

19:04.184 --> 19:05.644
{\an1}talking you could see the blood

19:05.727 --> 19:07.479
{\an1}pumping in his face, that's how

19:07.563 --> 19:08.397
{\an1}ghost white he gets.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.732
{\an1}He throws up and blah, all over

19:10.816 --> 19:11.358
{\an1}the floor, all over by the guy's

19:11.441 --> 19:13.986
{\an1}feet, there's beer, there's half

19:14.069 --> 19:14.444
{\an1}eaten chicken cutlets.

19:14.528 --> 19:16.113
{\an1}I'm like, "Listen, there's no

19:16.196 --> 19:17.239
{\an1}way that this kid is the one who

19:17.322 --> 19:18.073
{\an1}called your shop.

19:18.156 --> 19:19.783
{\an1}I'm telling you,

19:19.867 --> 19:20.576
{\an1}there's like no way."

19:20.659 --> 19:22.578
{\an1}And all of a sudden I see who I

19:22.661 --> 19:24.121
{\an1}know did call stumble

19:24.204 --> 19:25.414
{\an1}down the steps.

19:25.497 --> 19:26.498
{\an1}He's like, "What's going on

19:26.582 --> 19:27.416
{\an1}here, guys?"

19:27.499 --> 19:28.125
{\an1}Why is everyone downstairs?

19:28.208 --> 19:30.502
{\an1}I still don't got my mootzies.

19:30.586 --> 19:31.628
{\an1}And followed by him is my mother

19:31.712 --> 19:32.880
{\an1}who comes down and instead of

19:32.963 --> 19:33.755
{\an1}panicking she's like, "Put that

19:33.839 --> 19:34.756
{\an1}gun away.

19:34.840 --> 19:35.507
{\an1}Can't be having that gun in my

19:35.591 --> 19:36.758
{\an1}house, put that gun away."

19:36.842 --> 19:37.551
{\an1}I looked at this guy, "Dude,

19:37.634 --> 19:38.886
{\an1}man, I just had that sandwich

19:38.969 --> 19:39.887
{\an1}that I usually get, the Classic,

19:39.970 --> 19:40.470
{\an1}you kind of did something with

19:40.554 --> 19:42.014
{\an1}that gravy, right?

19:42.097 --> 19:42.890
{\an1}Something's different in there,

19:42.973 --> 19:43.849
{\an1}you added a certain spice

19:43.932 --> 19:44.558
{\an1}compared to last week."

19:44.641 --> 19:45.142
{\an1}He's like, "Yeah, man, we

19:45.225 --> 19:45.767
{\an1}changed the gravy up a little

19:45.851 --> 19:46.768
{\an1}bit.

19:46.852 --> 19:47.477
{\an1}Thank you for noticing."

19:47.561 --> 19:48.145
{\an1}I was like, "Dude, thank you.

19:48.228 --> 19:49.438
{\an1}It was delicious."

19:49.521 --> 19:50.439
{\an1}He kind of gives us all like a

19:50.522 --> 19:51.607
{\an1}once over, he looks at the guy,

19:51.690 --> 19:52.524
{\an1}he looks at the puke on the

19:52.608 --> 19:53.108
{\an1}ground, he slowly puts his gun

19:53.192 --> 19:54.860
{\an1}away.

19:54.943 --> 19:55.861
{\an1}He's like, "All right, listen,

19:55.944 --> 19:56.612
{\an1}I'll put the gun away, but

19:56.695 --> 19:57.154
{\an1}something's up, man.

19:57.237 --> 19:57.738
{\an1}You can't be calling up the

19:57.821 --> 19:58.363
{\an1}restaurant talking about things

19:58.447 --> 19:59.907
{\an1}like that.

19:59.990 --> 20:00.824
{\an1}I'm pissed off!"

20:00.908 --> 20:01.658
{\an1}I explained to the guy, you

20:01.742 --> 20:02.534
{\an1}know, "The kid's wasted, I'm

20:02.618 --> 20:02.951
{\an1}sorry about that."

20:03.035 --> 20:04.536
{\an1}He understands, we straighten

20:04.620 --> 20:04.912
{\an1}everything out.

20:04.995 --> 20:06.705
{\an1}We clean the puke off the floor.

20:06.788 --> 20:07.956
{\an1}My mom's like, "Guys, can you

20:08.040 --> 20:09.041
{\an1}please not call up and threaten

20:09.124 --> 20:09.875
{\an1}with a gun."

20:09.958 --> 20:10.959
{\an1}I'm like, "Ma, go upstairs, ma,

20:11.043 --> 20:11.043
{\an1}go upstairs."

20:11.043 --> 20:12.294
{\an7}She's like, "All right, all

20:12.377 --> 20:12.669
{\an7}right, I'm going."

20:12.753 --> 20:13.962
{\an7}The next day we had my uncle

20:14.046 --> 20:14.588
{\an7}who's like a kind of old-school

20:14.671 --> 20:15.339
{\an7}guy in the neighborhood.

20:15.422 --> 20:16.173
{\an7}He called up and kind of

20:16.256 --> 20:18.050
{\an7}straightened everything out,

20:18.133 --> 20:18.592
{\an7}smoothed everything over.

20:18.675 --> 20:20.218
{\an7}It was no problems, but I still

20:20.302 --> 20:22.846
{\an7}go to that deli to this day,

20:22.930 --> 20:25.641
{\an7}I just pick my food up.
