{\an1}the night, you know because

01:52.070 --> 01:53.238

{\an1}what is this guy going to do?"

02:06.376 --> 02:08.002
{\an1}He dives into this vodka bottle.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.378
{\an1}He comes up with the biggest

02:09.461 --> 02:10.295

02:10.380 --> 02:11.005
{\an1}in my life.

02:11.089 --> 02:11.798
{\an1}He pops up and he's got

02:11.881 --> 02:12.841
{\an1}no tooth.

02:12.924 --> 02:13.883
{\an1}He's got a little fragment of

02:13.967 --> 02:14.676
{\an1}a tooth left and that's it.

02:14.759 --> 02:15.134
{\an1}>> The tooth was gone!

02:15.218 --> 02:18.972
{\an1}>> He tried to open the vodka

02:19.055 --> 02:20.265
{\an1}bottle which, mind you, is a

02:20.348 --> 02:22.684
{\an1}twist off thinking that it's a

02:22.767 --> 02:23.810
{\an1}cork it's going to pop open like

02:23.893 --> 02:24.727
{\an1}some champagne bottle.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.020
{\an1}>> He wouldn't tell me!

02:26.104 --> 02:26.646
{\an1}>> No.

02:26.729 --> 02:27.438
{\an1}>> He didn't tell me that

02:27.522 --> 02:27.897
{\an1}the tooth was gone.

02:27.981 --> 02:28.857
{\an1}>> I wanted some entertainment.

02:28.940 --> 02:29.691
{\an1}>> So I'm going around the party

02:29.774 --> 02:30.775
{\an1}I'm talking-I'm continuing to

02:30.859 --> 02:32.819
{\an1}talk to this with no tooth

02:32.902 --> 02:33.862
{\an1}in my mouth, I'm dancing--

02:33.945 --> 02:34.779
{\an1}>> Of all nights, too, he's the

02:34.863 --> 02:35.738
{\an1}most social I've ever seen him.

02:35.822 --> 02:36.406
{\an1}He's just-the biggest wide smile

02:36.489 --> 02:38.366
{\an1}I've ever seen and our closest

02:38.449 --> 02:39.576
{\an1}friends, I mean, they wanted to

02:39.659 --> 02:40.869
{\an1}tell him, but I was like, "Nah,

02:40.952 --> 02:41.870
{\an1}why don't we just let this ride

02:41.953 --> 02:42.412
{\an1}out and see what happens."

02:42.495 --> 02:44.414
{\an1}So I'm looking at this kid,

02:44.497 --> 02:45.707
{\an1}he's blue--

02:45.790 --> 02:46.791
{\an1}>> "He's blue.

02:46.875 --> 02:47.417
{\an1}He's blue."

02:47.500 --> 02:48.293
{\an1}>> He's sweatin', he's got a

{\an1}that I remember.

{\an1}>> Oh no, you passed out but

03:02.765 --> 03:03.641
{\an1}some more shots.

03:03.725 --> 03:04.350
{\an1}>> Oh we did?

03:05.602 --> 03:06.936
{\an1}is possible but this is when he

{\an1}gets that girl's number.

03:09.272 --> 03:09.856
{\an1}>> RYAN: I told--

{\an1}I'm surprised you even knew how

03:12.734 --> 03:14.527
{\an1}to, to slide your phone on.

03:14.611 --> 03:15.987
{\an1}>> I wake up the next morning on

03:16.070 --> 03:17.447
{\an1}the living room floor in nothing

03:17.530 --> 03:20.283
{\an1}but my shoes and my boxers, but

03:20.366 --> 03:22.076
{\an1}because my shoes were still on

03:22.160 --> 03:25.079
{\an1}these [bleep] wrote all over me.

{\an1}They drew one going

03:30.043 --> 03:30.793
{\an1}into my mouth.

03:30.877 --> 03:33.004
{\an1}I look up, I see gimmoke

03:33.087 --> 03:34.881
{\an1}and he says, "Go upstairs,

03:34.964 --> 03:35.798
{\an1}look in the mirror."

03:35.882 --> 03:36.925
{\an1}>> And all of a sudden I hear

{\an1}It was outrageous, but I think

03:42.889 --> 03:44.807
{\an1}the best part was that when I

03:44.891 --> 03:46.851
{\an1}did realize I had the girl's

03:46.935 --> 03:48.478
{\an1}number in my phone we ended

03:53.858 --> 03:55.568
{\an1}I managed to do it and as I meet

03:55.652 --> 03:57.445
{\an1}her at the restaurant this girl

03:57.528 --> 03:59.572
{\an1}throws me a box of Chiclets

{\an1}It's 3:30 so I pull up at the

{\an1}apartment complex, three girls

04:44.742 --> 04:45.702
{\an1}come out, "Awesome, like,

{\an1}you're here.

04:46.619 --> 04:47.370

{\an1}"Wait, what?

04:50.873 --> 04:52.542
{\an1}Like, I just have your pizza."

04:52.625 --> 04:53.376
{\an1}Like what are you talking about?

04:53.459 --> 04:54.836
{\an1}"You actually brought a pizza?"

04:54.919 --> 04:55.837
{\an1}"Like, uh, what was I supposed

04:55.920 --> 04:56.671
{\an1}to bring?"

04:56.754 --> 04:57.380
{\an1}"Just come up with us."

04:57.463 --> 04:58.464
{\an1}"Okay."

04:58.548 --> 04:59.382
{\an1}They opened the door and like

04:59.465 --> 05:00.466
{\an1}all of a sudden there's just

05:00.550 --> 05:01.259
{\an1}like a room full of chicks,

05:01.342 --> 05:04.345
{\an1}like, about 15, 20 girls then I

05:04.429 --> 05:06.431
{\an1}saw it was like clearly a party,

05:06.514 --> 05:07.890
{\an1}a bachelorette party.

05:07.974 --> 05:10.435
{\an1}Hey, guys, the stripper's here.

05:10.518 --> 05:11.269

{\an1}They think I'm a stripper.

05:13.855 --> 05:14.772
{\an1}It's like the angel and the

05:14.856 --> 05:15.690
{\an1}devil.

05:15.773 --> 05:17.066
{\an1}And the angel's just like, "They

05:17.150 --> 05:18.359
{\an1}think you're someone else.

05:18.443 --> 05:19.527
{\an1}You should really just leave the

05:19.610 --> 05:20.653
{\an1}pizzas and go back.

05:20.737 --> 05:21.237
{\an1}You should finish your job."

05:21.320 --> 05:23.239
{\an1}And the devil's just like, "Bro,

05:23.322 --> 05:25.533
{\an1}how often do you get to be the

05:25.616 --> 05:26.325
{\an1}only dude in a room full of

05:26.409 --> 05:28.119
{\an1}girls?"

05:28.202 --> 05:28.745
{\an1}And I was just like, "He does

05:28.828 --> 05:32.415
{\an1}make a good argument."

05:32.498 --> 05:32.582
{\an1}Yeah.

05:32.665 --> 05:34.459
{\an1}And then all of a sudden, "I'm

05:34.542 --> 05:36.002
{\an1}Sexy Back" comes on.

05:36.085 --> 05:37.128
{\an1}All the girls are cheering, they

05:37.211 --> 05:39.005
{\an1}push the bachelorette up in the

05:39.088 --> 05:39.255
{\an1}chair.

05:39.338 --> 05:41.549
{\an1}I take my shirt off, start

05:41.632 --> 05:43.176
{\an1}giving this girl a lap dance,

05:43.259 --> 05:44.052
{\an1}and all of a sudden all the

05:44.135 --> 05:45.636
{\an1}girls just pull out freezer bags

05:45.720 --> 05:47.430
{\an1}filled with dollar bills making

05:47.513 --> 05:48.431
{\an1}it rain.

05:48.514 --> 05:49.640
{\an1}So, I take the pants off 'cause

05:49.724 --> 05:51.017
{\an1}I'm just like, you know, we're

05:51.100 --> 05:51.893
{\an1}escalating this.

05:51.976 --> 05:52.852
{\an1}We're pushing it, like, let's

05:52.935 --> 05:53.853
{\an1}just see where it goes.

05:53.936 --> 05:54.896
{\an1}All of a sudden she throws a

05:54.979 --> 05:55.938
{\an1}curve ball, "Have you ever been

05:56.022 --> 05:57.690
{\an1}with a 30-year-old?"

05:57.774 --> 05:58.316
{\an1}What?

05:58.399 --> 06:01.152
{\an1}So she pulls me away into a

06:01.235 --> 06:03.029
{\an1}room, we're about to actually

06:03.112 --> 06:03.988
{\an1}hook up.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.823
{\an1}The devil's doing a little bop

06:05.907 --> 06:07.116
{\an1}dance just like this and all of

06:07.200 --> 06:08.910
{\an1}a sudden the music stops.

06:08.993 --> 06:10.036
{\an1}One of the girls goes, "Hey,

06:10.119 --> 06:11.162
{\an1}could you guys come out here for

06:11.245 --> 06:12.622
{\an1}a second?"

06:12.705 --> 06:14.540
{\an1}And there's this big tall dude,

06:14.624 --> 06:16.125
{\an1}kind of buff, he looks like a

06:16.209 --> 06:16.417
{\an1}stripper.

06:16.501 --> 06:19.420
{\an1}Uh, I was scared that the other

06:19.504 --> 06:20.588
{\an1}guy was going to fight me,

06:20.671 --> 06:21.839
{\an1}more that the girls were going

06:21.923 --> 06:22.548
{\an1}to fight me.

06:22.632 --> 06:23.132
{\an1}Girls are vicious especially

06:23.216 --> 06:24.509
{\an1}like a pack of them and they're

06:24.592 --> 06:25.843
{\an1}drunk.

06:25.927 --> 06:27.053
{\an1}So, one girl, she looks back at

06:27.136 --> 06:28.387
{\an1}me and she says, "So, this guy

06:28.471 --> 06:30.932
{\an1}is the stripper.

06:31.015 --> 06:32.141
{\an1}Who are you?"

06:32.225 --> 06:33.434
{\an1}All eyes just went from here to

06:33.518 --> 06:35.144
{\an1}right on me.

06:35.228 --> 06:35.394
{\an1}Uhh.

06:35.478 --> 06:38.564
{\an1}>> [dramatic music]

06:38.648 --> 06:39.482
{\an1}>> And I was just like, "The

06:39.565 --> 06:40.525
{\an1}pizza's on me."

06:40.608 --> 06:41.692
{\an1}And I just ran out of the house,

06:41.776 --> 06:43.027
{\an1}left my shirt, left my shorts

06:43.111 --> 06:43.486
{\an1}there, found my keys,

06:43.569 --> 06:46.072
{\an1}and just dipped.

06:46.155 --> 06:47.657
{\an1}I just told my co-workers

06:47.740 --> 06:48.449
{\an1}what happened.

06:48.533 --> 06:48.991
{\an1}They weren't that surprised

06:49.075 --> 06:50.243
{\an1}by it.

06:50.326 --> 06:51.536
{\an1}Apparently they have hooked up

06:51.619 --> 06:55.832
{\an1}with women on deliveries before.

06:55.915 --> 06:59.836
{\an1}>> [Tropical music]

06:59.919 --> 07:00.795
{\an1}>> So, me and my friends have

07:00.878 --> 07:01.879
{\an1}been planning this trip to Guam

07:01.963 --> 07:03.589
{\an1}for a long time.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.216
{\an1}So, Guam is an island which is

07:05.299 --> 07:06.592
{\an1}about four hours from Hawaii and

07:06.676 --> 07:07.885
{\an1}four hours from Japan and I'd

07:07.969 --> 07:09.095
{\an1}never been outside of Delaware

07:09.178 --> 07:10.721
{\an1}at the time, and as soon as we

07:10.805 --> 07:11.347
{\an1}had gotten there we got a call

07:11.430 --> 07:13.724
{\an1}from one of my friends, "Let's

07:13.808 --> 07:15.601
{\an1}go to this party in the woods."

07:15.685 --> 07:16.435
{\an1}So, we started driving into the

07:16.519 --> 07:19.605
{\an1}woods, it's pitch black, there's

07:19.689 --> 07:19.856
{\an1}no lights.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.274
{\an1}I'm scared a deer's going to

07:21.357 --> 07:22.692
{\an1}jump in front or Big Foot's

07:22.775 --> 07:23.609
{\an1}going to walk walk across

07:23.693 --> 07:24.152
{\an1}and it's going to go threw

07:24.235 --> 07:25.194
{\an1}the windshield.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.070
{\an1}>> [roaring]

07:26.154 --> 07:26.904
{\an1}>> So, we turn around and go,

07:26.988 --> 07:27.697
{\an1}"Money!

07:27.780 --> 07:28.656
{\an1}These people got money!"

07:28.739 --> 07:30.324
{\an1}This house was huge!

07:30.408 --> 07:31.576
{\an1}I feel like the hood going into

07:31.659 --> 07:32.493
{\an1}this house.

07:32.577 --> 07:33.828
{\an1}I mean, nobody looked basic

07:33.911 --> 07:35.037
{\an1}there but this.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.664
{\an1}Everybody was nice and I don't

07:36.747 --> 07:37.665
{\an1}care what I look.

07:37.748 --> 07:39.000
{\an1}Like, [bleep], I'm here to have

07:39.083 --> 07:40.168
{\an1}fun, [bleep] everybody else.

07:40.251 --> 07:41.335
{\an1}This ain't no fashion show.

07:41.419 --> 07:42.295
{\an1}The party is killing, there's

07:42.378 --> 07:43.754
{\an1}thousands of people there.

07:43.838 --> 07:45.131
{\an1}Stuff was catching on fire,

07:45.214 --> 07:46.924
{\an1}people were jumping in the pool.

07:47.008 --> 07:47.967
{\an1}There was somebody literally

07:48.050 --> 07:49.552
{\an1}swinging from the chandelier.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.262
{\an1}And then some girl actually had

07:51.345 --> 07:53.681
{\an1}threw up in the fruit punch like

07:53.764 --> 07:54.599
{\an1}the Exorcist.

07:54.682 --> 07:55.558
{\an1}I was about to throw up,

07:55.641 --> 07:56.601
{\an1}everybody about to throw up.

07:56.684 --> 07:57.226
{\an1}And then somebody came in and

07:57.310 --> 07:59.520
{\an1}drunk the fruit punch.

07:59.604 --> 08:00.396
{\an1}"Mm, it's good."

08:00.479 --> 08:03.983
{\an1}I'm like, "That is disgusting!"

08:04.066 --> 08:05.276
{\an1}How can you not taste the chunks

08:05.359 --> 08:06.652
{\an1}in that?

08:06.736 --> 08:08.321
{\an1}So, suddenly I see a fight, "Oh,

08:08.404 --> 08:09.197
{\an1}oh, oh."

08:09.280 --> 08:11.240
{\an1}Like, wigs, pieces flying every

08:11.324 --> 08:12.325
{\an1}which way.

08:12.408 --> 08:12.867
{\an1}So, I grab them, starting

08:12.950 --> 08:14.619
{\an1}picking the weave pieces up and

08:14.702 --> 08:15.578
{\an1}put them in my pocket.

08:15.661 --> 08:16.204
{\an1}People are looking at me, I'm

08:16.287 --> 08:17.163
{\an1}like, "What?"

08:17.246 --> 08:18.122
{\an1}Like, I'm about to have me a

08:18.206 --> 08:19.665
{\an1}souvenir and then all we hear

08:19.749 --> 08:20.625
{\an1}is, "Boom, boom, boom."

08:20.708 --> 08:21.626
{\an1}I turn around and there's these

08:21.709 --> 08:24.086
{\an1}big police officers, like eight

08:24.170 --> 08:24.795
{\an1}of them.

08:24.879 --> 08:25.671
{\an1}Everybody was screaming,

08:25.755 --> 08:26.631
{\an1}everybody started running,

08:26.714 --> 08:27.882
{\an1}people were getting handcuffed.

08:27.965 --> 08:30.968
{\an1}I'm looking like, "Oh [bleep]!"

08:31.052 --> 08:31.969
{\an1}I'm looking at people, they got

08:32.053 --> 08:34.222
{\an1}money, they got Gucci stuff,

08:34.304 --> 08:35.597
{\an1}they got nice necklaces,

08:35.681 --> 08:36.432
{\an1}expensive stuff.

08:36.515 --> 08:40.977
{\an1}This is a drug dealer's house.

08:41.062 --> 08:42.188
{\an1}I started running.

08:42.270 --> 08:43.272
{\an1}I was running and running and

08:43.356 --> 08:43.940
{\an1}running and my phone's dead and

08:44.023 --> 08:45.399
{\an1}I couldn't find nobody.

08:45.483 --> 08:46.234
{\an1}I had nothing.

08:46.317 --> 08:47.193
{\an1}So, I 'm running so fast my

08:47.276 --> 08:48.319
{\an1}shoes even take off.

08:48.402 --> 08:49.195
{\an1}They're like, "[bleep] you!

08:49.278 --> 08:49.904
{\an1}I'm out of here."

08:49.987 --> 08:50.571
{\an1}Oh, I cussed again,

08:50.655 --> 08:53.241
{\an1}ahh-ha-ha-ha.

08:53.324 --> 08:54.951
{\an1}So I'm running!

08:55.034 --> 08:56.869
{\an1}I'm crying, "Mommy!"

08:56.953 --> 08:57.912
{\an1}I'm trying to find somewhere to

08:57.995 --> 08:58.871
{\an1}go, I need to get away from

08:58.955 --> 08:59.830
{\an1}these police and I see a

08:59.914 --> 09:00.665
{\an1}dumpster so I had to jump in

09:00.748 --> 09:02.708
{\an1}there.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.585
{\an1}It smells disgusting, but I

09:04.669 --> 09:05.711
{\an1}can't get arrested.

09:05.795 --> 09:06.837
{\an1}I'm not about to go to Guamanian

09:06.921 --> 09:08.673
{\an1}jail, no-oh.

09:08.756 --> 09:09.757
{\an1}I'm sucking my thumb like a

09:09.840 --> 09:10.716
{\an1}newborn baby.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.177
{\an1}I'm like--[whimpering].

09:13.261 --> 09:13.678
{\an1}I'm crying, everything.

09:13.761 --> 09:15.596
{\an1}I'm scared of spiders, scared of

09:15.680 --> 09:15.805
{\an1}snakes.

09:15.888 --> 09:17.640
{\an1}I'm on an exotic island, I can

09:17.723 --> 09:18.933
{\an1}only imagine what's lurking.

09:19.016 --> 09:20.268
{\an1}I'm so terrified of the dark, my

09:20.351 --> 09:21.227
{\an1}mind plays tricks on me in the

09:21.310 --> 09:22.270
{\an1}dark.

09:22.353 --> 09:23.354
{\an1}And I'm hearing somebody or

09:23.437 --> 09:25.106
{\an1}something is walking in the

09:25.189 --> 09:25.982
{\an1}woods.

09:26.065 --> 09:27.400
{\an1}I can hear the leaves crunching,

09:27.483 --> 09:29.318
{\an1}I hear an owl-type noise.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.820
{\an1}I hear stuff slither, I hear a

09:30.903 --> 09:33.197
{\an1}woodpecker.

09:33.281 --> 09:34.031
{\an1}You know when you're scared of

09:34.115 --> 09:35.032
{\an1}the dark and then you got the

09:35.116 --> 09:36.033
{\an1}blanket on top of you in your

09:36.117 --> 09:36.951
{\an1}bed, and you're like, "Yo, I'm

09:37.034 --> 09:38.327
{\an1}scared to look out this blanket.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.370
{\an1}I think I'd rather get killed in

09:39.453 --> 09:40.913
{\an1}this blanket than look at what's

09:40.997 --> 09:41.706
{\an1}killing me."

09:41.789 --> 09:42.623
{\an1}That's what it was like for me,

09:42.707 --> 09:43.958
{\an1}so I'd open it, I'd close it,

09:44.041 --> 09:46.043
{\an1}open it and close it.

09:46.127 --> 09:48.254
{\an1}And then I finally came out when

09:48.337 --> 09:50.631
{\an1}it was two hours later.

09:50.715 --> 09:51.215
{\an1}That's when mosquitoes started

09:51.299 --> 09:53.217
{\an1}jumping me.

09:53.301 --> 09:54.802
{\an1}I'm itching, screaming, cussing,

09:54.885 --> 09:56.137
{\an1}cussing at myself, cussing at

09:56.220 --> 09:57.305
{\an1}the wind, cussing at the trees.

09:57.388 --> 09:58.097
{\an1}I feel like they're all looking

09:58.180 --> 09:59.140
{\an1}at me.

09:59.223 --> 10:00.099
{\an1}I tried to back track and I

10:00.182 --> 10:00.891
{\an1}couldn't.

10:00.975 --> 10:03.019
{\an1}I had no compass, no phone, I

10:03.102 --> 10:03.811
{\an1}don't even know nothing about

10:03.894 --> 10:04.937
{\an1}the [bleep].

10:05.021 --> 10:06.022
{\an1}Oh, let me find out, there, the

10:06.105 --> 10:07.148
{\an1}Northern Lights are over there.

10:07.231 --> 10:08.065
{\an1}I don't know nothing about that

10:08.149 --> 10:08.983
{\an1}stuff.

10:09.066 --> 10:10.026
{\an1}I thought I was going to die,

10:10.109 --> 10:11.319
{\an1}like, I really felt like there

10:11.402 --> 10:12.194
{\an1}was no way I was going to get

10:12.278 --> 10:14.071
{\an1}out of here.

10:14.155 --> 10:14.613
{\an1}It turns out I ran

10:14.697 --> 10:18.117
{\an1}three minutes away.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.827
{\an1}Seriously, why was I

10:19.910 --> 10:20.786
{\an1}even running?

10:20.870 --> 10:21.203
{\an1}I could've just went

10:21.287 --> 10:22.705
{\an1}into the car.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.790
{\an1}The car was unlocked,

10:24.874 --> 10:25.833
{\an1}but whatever.

10:25.916 --> 10:27.209
{\an1}We got home, they passed out,

10:27.293 --> 10:27.752
{\an1}and I just started going ham

10:27.835 --> 10:29.420
{\an1}on food.

10:29.503 --> 10:30.296
{\an1}Just [bleep] up.

10:30.379 --> 10:31.255
{\an1}I'm eating food I don't even

10:31.339 --> 10:32.673
{\an1}like, and just eating and eating

17:13.115 --> 17:15.492
{\an1}Calypso Punk Rock-type of band

17:15.576 --> 17:16.160
{\an1}and we try to play a show once,

17:16.242 --> 17:18.328
{\an1}twice every week.

17:18.412 --> 17:19.829
{\an1}A couple years ago we played a

17:19.913 --> 17:20.455
{\an1}show in Queens which was really

17:20.539 --> 17:22.499
{\an1}cool because we are only five

17:22.583 --> 17:23.625
{\an1}minutes away from my parents

17:23.709 --> 17:24.501
{\an1}house.

17:24.585 --> 17:25.586
{\an1}So we got carloads of people

17:25.669 --> 17:26.920
{\an1}coming in, kegs flowing, the

17:27.003 --> 17:27.796
{\an1}deck is filled.

17:27.880 --> 17:28.756
{\an1}Upstairs is full, basement's

17:28.839 --> 17:30.424
{\an1}full, my parents were upstairs,

17:30.507 --> 17:31.800
{\an1}so after a while people get

17:31.884 --> 17:32.718
{\an1}hungry.

17:32.801 --> 17:33.302
{\an1}So, we call up this place, we

17:33.385 --> 17:35.095
{\an1}order 20, 25 of the craziest

17:35.179 --> 17:37.431
{\an1}sandwiches you can imagine,

17:37.514 --> 17:39.683
{\an1}mozzarella sticks, french fries,

17:39.767 --> 17:40.476
{\an1}pretzels.

17:40.559 --> 17:41.310
{\an1}Forty-five minutes, an hour

17:41.393 --> 17:42.102
{\an1}later everything comes except

17:42.186 --> 17:44.646
{\an1}for this one kid's mozzarella

17:44.730 --> 17:45.522
{\an1}sticks.

17:45.606 --> 17:46.565
{\an1}We call it the mootzies, and not

17:46.648 --> 17:47.149
{\an1}even like that, "Moot-zies,"

17:47.232 --> 17:48.192
{\an1}like that, "Moot-zies."

17:48.275 --> 17:49.193
{\an1}And so, unbeknownst to my

17:49.276 --> 17:52.488
{\an1}brother and I he takes a phone

17:52.571 --> 17:53.113
{\an1}and he calls up the deli and he

17:53.197 --> 17:55.532
{\an1}starts talking trash being like,

17:55.616 --> 17:56.742
{\an1}"Yo, you guys forgot my

17:56.825 --> 17:57.326
{\an1}mootzies, I'm going to come to

17:57.409 --> 17:57.993
{\an1}that place, I'm going to break

17:58.076 --> 17:59.870
{\an1}all the windows.

17:59.953 --> 18:00.579
{\an1}I'm going to throw [bleep] all

18:00.662 --> 18:01.538
{\an1}over the walls, I'm going to

18:01.622 --> 18:02.748
{\an1}break all of the glass that

18:02.831 --> 18:03.665
{\an1}holds the meats.

18:03.749 --> 18:04.541
{\an1}I'm going to tear it up.

18:04.625 --> 18:05.167
{\an1}He's like, "Yeah, where are

18:05.250 --> 18:05.834
{\an1}you?"

18:05.918 --> 18:06.502
{\an1}And my friend's like, "Oh,

18:06.585 --> 18:06.668
{\an1}okay."

18:06.752 --> 18:08.003
{\an1}And he gives my address, and he

18:08.086 --> 18:09.505
{\an1}says, "I got a knife tucked

18:09.588 --> 18:10.047
{\an1}behind my pants.

18:10.130 --> 18:10.547
{\an1}You want to come see me?

18:10.631 --> 18:12.174
{\an1}You come see me."

18:12.257 --> 18:13.091
{\an1}Twenty-five minutes later people

18:13.175 --> 18:14.051
{\an1}are going in and out now.

18:14.134 --> 18:15.928
{\an1}Some people are checking on

18:16.011 --> 18:16.553
{\an1}their cars, people are leaving,

18:16.637 --> 18:17.888
{\an1}I'm not paying attention.

18:17.971 --> 18:19.389
{\an1}So, I hear a, "Bang, bang, bang,

18:19.473 --> 18:19.681
{\an1}bang, bang!"

18:19.765 --> 18:20.265
{\an1}I have wooden doors so it's

18:20.349 --> 18:21.099
{\an1}super-duper deep, the whole

18:21.183 --> 18:23.018
{\an1}house rocks.

18:23.101 --> 18:24.812
{\an1}So I open the door, staring me

18:24.895 --> 18:26.605
{\an1}in the face is the biggest gun I

18:26.688 --> 18:28.023
{\an1}have ever seen in my life.

18:28.106 --> 18:29.983
{\an1}He didn't pull it out, it was

18:30.067 --> 18:30.859
{\an1}out all ready.

18:30.943 --> 18:31.735
{\an1}I'm like, "Dude, what's going

18:31.819 --> 18:32.402
{\an1}on?

18:32.486 --> 18:33.028
{\an1}Man, what's going on?"

18:33.111 --> 18:33.654
{\an1}He's like, "Well, someone just

18:33.737 --> 18:34.279
{\an1}called my restaurant talking all

18:34.363 --> 18:36.073
{\an1}this smack and I want some

18:36.156 --> 18:36.365
{\an1}answers."

18:36.448 --> 18:37.074
{\an1}Well, I was like, "Dude, I

18:37.157 --> 18:38.116
{\an1}didn't call you and my brother

18:38.200 --> 18:39.034
{\an1}definitely didn't call you."

18:39.117 --> 18:40.744
{\an1}So I was like, "Call the number

18:40.828 --> 18:42.079
{\an1}of the cell phone that called

18:42.162 --> 18:42.955
{\an1}you."

18:43.038 --> 18:43.664
{\an1}He's like, "Okay, I'm going to

18:43.747 --> 18:44.081
{\an1}call it."

18:44.164 --> 18:44.706
{\an1}And then all of a sudden we hear

18:44.790 --> 18:47.376
{\an1}this vibrating buzz, buzz.

18:47.459 --> 18:48.126
{\an1}And then like a carousel-type

18:48.210 --> 18:52.089
{\an1}ring like-- [melodic humming]

18:52.172 --> 18:53.799
{\an1}And we look over and it's just

18:53.882 --> 18:55.008
{\an1}the littlest kid in the party.

18:55.092 --> 18:56.426
{\an1}He must've been twice or three

18:56.510 --> 18:57.845
{\an1}times the size of the sandwich

18:57.928 --> 18:58.804
{\an1}that he just ate, literally.

18:58.887 --> 18:59.680
{\an1}This little, little kid in the

18:59.763 --> 19:01.682
{\an1}corner and he swings the gun and

19:01.765 --> 19:02.516
{\an1}looks at this kid.

19:02.599 --> 19:03.475
{\an1}He's like, "What's up?"

19:03.559 --> 19:04.101
{\an1}And he gets ghost white, I'm

19:04.184 --> 19:05.644
{\an1}talking you could see the blood

19:05.727 --> 19:07.479
{\an1}pumping in his face, that's how

19:07.563 --> 19:08.397
{\an1}ghost white he gets.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.732
{\an1}He throws up and blah, all over

19:10.816 --> 19:11.358
{\an1}the floor, all over by the guy's

19:11.441 --> 19:13.986
{\an1}feet, there's beer, there's half

19:14.069 --> 19:14.444
{\an1}eaten chicken cutlets.

19:14.528 --> 19:16.113
{\an1}I'm like, "Listen, there's no

19:16.196 --> 19:17.239
{\an1}way that this kid is the one who

19:17.322 --> 19:18.073
{\an1}called your shop.

19:18.156 --> 19:19.783
{\an1}I'm telling you,

19:19.867 --> 19:20.576
{\an1}there's like no way."

19:20.659 --> 19:22.578
{\an1}And all of a sudden I see who I

19:22.661 --> 19:24.121
{\an1}know did call stumble

19:24.204 --> 19:25.414
{\an1}down the steps.

19:25.497 --> 19:26.498
{\an1}He's like, "What's going on

19:26.582 --> 19:27.416
{\an1}here, guys?"

19:27.499 --> 19:28.125
{\an1}Why is everyone downstairs?

19:28.208 --> 19:30.502
{\an1}I still don't got my mootzies.

19:30.586 --> 19:31.628
{\an1}And followed by him is my mother

19:31.712 --> 19:32.880
{\an1}who comes down and instead of

19:32.963 --> 19:33.755
{\an1}panicking she's like, "Put that

19:33.839 --> 19:34.756
{\an1}gun away.

19:34.840 --> 19:35.507
{\an1}Can't be having that gun in my

19:35.591 --> 19:36.758
{\an1}house, put that gun away."

19:36.842 --> 19:37.551
{\an1}I looked at this guy, "Dude,

19:37.634 --> 19:38.886
{\an1}man, I just had that sandwich

19:38.969 --> 19:39.887
{\an1}that I usually get, the Classic,

19:39.970 --> 19:40.470
{\an1}you kind of did something with

19:40.554 --> 19:42.014
{\an1}that gravy, right?

19:42.097 --> 19:42.890
{\an1}Something's different in there,

19:42.973 --> 19:43.849
{\an1}you added a certain spice

19:43.932 --> 19:44.558
{\an1}compared to last week."

19:44.641 --> 19:45.142
{\an1}He's like, "Yeah, man, we

19:45.225 --> 19:45.767
{\an1}changed the gravy up a little

19:45.851 --> 19:46.768
{\an1}bit.

19:46.852 --> 19:47.477
{\an1}Thank you for noticing."

19:47.561 --> 19:48.145
{\an1}I was like, "Dude, thank you.

19:48.228 --> 19:49.438
{\an1}It was delicious."

19:49.521 --> 19:50.439
{\an1}He kind of gives us all like a

19:50.522 --> 19:51.607
{\an1}once over, he looks at the guy,

19:51.690 --> 19:52.524
{\an1}he looks at the puke on the

19:52.608 --> 19:53.108
{\an1}ground, he slowly puts his gun

19:53.192 --> 19:54.860
{\an1}away.

19:54.943 --> 19:55.861
{\an1}He's like, "All right, listen,

19:55.944 --> 19:56.612
{\an1}I'll put the gun away, but

19:56.695 --> 19:57.154
{\an1}something's up, man.

19:57.237 --> 19:57.738
{\an1}You can't be calling up the

19:57.821 --> 19:58.363
{\an1}restaurant talking about things

19:58.447 --> 19:59.907
{\an1}like that.

19:59.990 --> 20:00.824
{\an1}I'm pissed off!"

20:00.908 --> 20:01.658
{\an1}I explained to the guy, you

20:01.742 --> 20:02.534
{\an1}know, "The kid's wasted, I'm

20:02.618 --> 20:02.951
{\an1}sorry about that."

20:03.035 --> 20:04.536
{\an1}He understands, we straighten

20:04.620 --> 20:04.912
{\an1}everything out.

20:04.995 --> 20:06.705
{\an1}We clean the puke off the floor.

20:06.788 --> 20:07.956
{\an1}My mom's like, "Guys, can you

20:08.040 --> 20:09.041
{\an1}please not call up and threaten

20:09.124 --> 20:09.875
{\an1}with a gun."

20:09.958 --> 20:10.959
{\an1}I'm like, "Ma, go upstairs, ma,

20:11.043 --> 20:11.043
{\an1}go upstairs."

20:11.043 --> 20:12.294
{\an7}She's like, "All right, all

20:12.377 --> 20:12.669
{\an7}right, I'm going."

20:12.753 --> 20:13.962
{\an7}The next day we had my uncle

20:14.046 --> 20:14.588
{\an7}who's like a kind of old-school

20:14.671 --> 20:15.339
{\an7}guy in the neighborhood.

20:15.422 --> 20:16.173
{\an7}He called up and kind of

20:16.256 --> 20:18.050
{\an7}straightened everything out,

20:18.133 --> 20:18.592
{\an7}smoothed everything over.

20:18.675 --> 20:20.218
{\an7}It was no problems, but I still

20:20.302 --> 20:22.846
{\an7}go to that deli to this day,

20:22.930 --> 20:25.641
{\an7}I just pick my food up.
