WEBVTT

00:03.545 --> 00:05.672
Well, folks,
it's almost Halloween,

00:05.756 --> 00:07.591
a holiday so beloved in Langley

00:07.674 --> 00:09.551
that we celebrate
for a whole week.

00:09.635 --> 00:11.345
Happy Halloween Week, Memphis.

00:11.428 --> 00:13.805
And a boo to you too, Greg.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.266
Memphis, what are you being
for Halloween this year?

00:16.350 --> 00:18.477
I'm going to be a big,
scary spider.

00:19.269 --> 00:20.270
Are you serious?

00:20.354 --> 00:22.105
You know that's what
I was gonna be.

00:22.189 --> 00:23.565
Oh, no. I forgot.

00:24.858 --> 00:27.444
In other news, an investigation

00:27.528 --> 00:30.030
into the Octa Dual Formaldehyde
plant is underway

00:30.113 --> 00:33.784
due to a major leak that
is tainting our drinking water.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.246
Wait, wa... was that funny?

00:37.329 --> 00:40.916
So far, several people
have been hospitalized, and, get this,

00:40.999 --> 00:42.918
may have to miss Halloween.

00:43.001 --> 00:44.419
Hey, Greg,
you can be the spider.

00:44.503 --> 00:46.213
Don't.A town hall will be held

00:46.296 --> 00:48.507
by the CEO this week
to address the issue.

00:48.590 --> 00:51.760
Octa Dual is encouraging
all members of the community to attend,

00:51.844 --> 00:54.012
but would prefer those
who aren't that mad.

00:54.680 --> 00:56.682
We are going to that town hall.

00:56.765 --> 01:00.018
The two things I love most
in this world are in danger.

01:00.102 --> 01:01.520
Steve and Hayley.

01:01.603 --> 01:03.230
Water and Halloween.

01:03.397 --> 01:05.315
Steve and Hayley? Please.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.025
Steve can't even bother
to show up

01:07.109 --> 01:08.652
to watch the news
with his family.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.654
He's working on his science
club presentation

01:10.737 --> 01:12.573
for the big Halloween
pep rally at Pearl Bailey.

01:12.656 --> 01:15.784
Hayley, I am so tired of you
knowing where your brother is.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.915
Good morning, U.S.A.

01:21.999 --> 01:25.335
I got a feelin' that
it's gonna be a wonderful day

01:25.544 --> 01:28.505
The sun in the sky
has a smile on his face

01:28.589 --> 01:32.092
And he's shining' a salute
to the American race

01:34.970 --> 01:38.098
Oh, boy, it's swell to say

01:38.182 --> 01:40.350
-Good...
-Good morning, U.S.A.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.435
Ah!

01:43.312 --> 01:45.939
Good morning, U.S.A.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.444
Did you use acetone on these?

01:50.527 --> 01:52.070
They're covered
in water spots.

01:52.154 --> 01:55.073
Acetone dissolves my skin.

01:55.157 --> 01:57.701
Everything dissolves
your skin, Billy.

01:57.784 --> 02:00.287
Where's Snot?
He's late to science club again.

02:00.370 --> 02:02.122
Snot hates science.

02:02.206 --> 02:06.168
The only thing he likes
about science club is Bartleby.

02:08.378 --> 02:10.255
Snot loves science club.

02:10.339 --> 02:12.007
It's the only time we get
to spend together

02:12.090 --> 02:13.884
since our class
schedules changed.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.594
Bartleby's just a fun perk.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.095
Bartleby!

02:17.179 --> 02:18.764
I missed you, buddy.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.307
I made you a little hat.

02:20.390 --> 02:21.558
It says "Bar."

02:21.767 --> 02:23.602
It was supposed to say
"Bartleby,"

02:23.685 --> 02:25.812
but I ran out of room
because you have

02:25.896 --> 02:29.191
such a cute whittle bitty
turtle head.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.695
By the way,
Happy Halloween Week.

02:33.779 --> 02:36.240
And a boo to you, too.

02:36.323 --> 02:38.450
May your eyes of Newt
see into hell.

02:38.534 --> 02:39.535
You're late.

02:39.785 --> 02:40.786
Sorry.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.996
-I'm here now, though, and...
-What's this?

02:43.705 --> 02:46.208
A brochure for croquet club?

02:46.458 --> 02:48.377
Are you joining croquet club?

02:48.460 --> 02:50.212
They meet at the same time
as us.

02:50.295 --> 02:52.130
Okay, truth time.

02:52.214 --> 02:53.507
I don't like science.

02:53.590 --> 02:54.883
What?

02:55.175 --> 02:56.260
You mean to tell me

02:56.343 --> 02:59.012
you only like science club
for Bartleby?

02:59.179 --> 03:00.180
Where is he?

03:04.226 --> 03:05.477
Oh, dang!

03:05.561 --> 03:07.396
He's dancing between
the raindrops!

03:07.479 --> 03:10.023
There's not a car alive
that could hit Bartleby!

03:10.399 --> 03:12.442
Bartleby, no!

03:12.526 --> 03:13.527
Oh, my God!

03:16.029 --> 03:17.155
This is terrible!

03:17.656 --> 03:18.907
Poor Bartleby.

03:19.658 --> 03:22.202
Steve, I'm sorry,
but I think this is a sign

03:22.286 --> 03:23.996
I need to leave science club.

03:24.079 --> 03:26.164
What? No, you can't.

03:26.415 --> 03:28.792
-You!
-Is that Principal Lewis?

03:28.876 --> 03:30.794
What's he saying?

03:30.878 --> 03:33.255
Oo! You gotta burn
that broken turtle!

03:33.338 --> 03:36.091
I've planned everything perfectly
for the Halloween Pep Rally,

03:36.175 --> 03:39.553
and the last thing I need
is a big ol' turtle ghost haunting us.

03:39.636 --> 03:42.181
You can use the school
incinerator in the basement.

03:42.264 --> 03:44.516
Is that kid smoking
by the bicycle stands?

03:44.600 --> 03:46.685
He told me he was
out of cigarettes.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.187
You...

03:56.528 --> 03:59.281
Touch the red flower.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.702
I can't believe I've lost
Bartleby and Snot in one day.

04:03.785 --> 04:05.787
You haven't lost Snot.

04:05.871 --> 04:07.623
He's your best friend.

04:07.706 --> 04:08.790
For now.

04:08.874 --> 04:11.752
Friendships need nourishment
and quality time.

04:11.835 --> 04:13.962
Without science club,
we'll drift apart.

04:14.046 --> 04:16.715
Want me to cheer you up?

04:19.092 --> 04:21.136
The only thing you could do
that would cheer me up

04:21.220 --> 04:22.930
is bring Bartleby
back to life.

04:23.013 --> 04:25.182
Oh, that's easy.

04:25.265 --> 04:28.977
My dad does that all the time
with his reanimator.

04:29.061 --> 04:33.899
He keeps it locked up,
but I know where the schematics are.

04:33.982 --> 04:36.401
Do you think we could build it
in time for the pep rally?

04:36.485 --> 04:39.863
Does this answer
your question?

04:41.865 --> 04:43.825
Did you just learn that face
or something?

04:43.909 --> 04:44.910
Yeah.

04:47.621 --> 04:50.791
Okay, here's how
it's gonna go down.

04:50.874 --> 04:56.046
I run up and grab the plans
while you distract my dad.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.422
I don't want to go in there.

04:57.506 --> 04:59.466
Dr. Kalgary freaks me out.

04:59.716 --> 05:04.096
I thought I heard the chirps
of little children out here.

05:04.346 --> 05:06.807
Happy Halloween Week, Steven.

05:06.890 --> 05:08.892
May... May the ghosts
nip your toes, sir.

05:08.976 --> 05:12.312
I just need to run upstairs
and grab some notes.

05:12.396 --> 05:15.774
Go ahead, my little
synthetic angel.

05:15.858 --> 05:20.612
Steven, why don't you come in?

05:24.700 --> 05:28.120
Have a seat
on our sectional sofa.

05:28.203 --> 05:30.205
It's new from...

05:30.414 --> 05:34.126
Restoration Hardware!

05:39.256 --> 05:41.133
Are you stealing my soul?

05:41.216 --> 05:42.801
Okay, got the notes.

05:42.885 --> 05:43.927
Let's go.

05:46.555 --> 05:48.640
Another boy convinced

05:48.724 --> 05:52.644
I own mid-tier furniture!

06:02.446 --> 06:04.990
And now, as is Halloween
Pep Rally tradition,

06:05.073 --> 06:07.326
we shall see presentations
from the clubs.

06:15.626 --> 06:17.419
-We're skeletons!
-Ooh!

06:18.378 --> 06:20.797
Croquet club has pleased me.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.716
Science club, you're next.

06:23.592 --> 06:25.761
Science club
has built a machine

06:25.844 --> 06:28.555
that defies
the laws of science!

06:30.933 --> 06:32.476
I told you to burn that!

06:32.768 --> 06:37.606
What once was dead and gone
may finally live again!

06:37.898 --> 06:40.025
Billy! Pull the lever!

06:40.859 --> 06:43.987
Behold the feats
of science club!

06:44.071 --> 06:45.447
Especially you, Snot.

06:57.543 --> 06:59.086
Bartleby's back!

06:59.419 --> 07:01.588
And so is my interest
in science.

07:01.839 --> 07:03.340
This is an abomination!

07:03.590 --> 07:05.676
I'll burn that monster myself!

07:06.593 --> 07:09.263
No! Don't!

07:09.429 --> 07:12.349
I... I need him, or Snot won't
come back to science club!

07:12.432 --> 07:14.393
I'm canceling science club...

07:16.603 --> 07:20.274
...forever!

07:20.357 --> 07:22.150
I won't let you!

07:22.401 --> 07:25.904
I'm bouncing' down the stairs!

07:27.114 --> 07:29.366
I'm... losing consciousness.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.034
Maybe to die.

07:39.084 --> 07:41.795
Smith, Billy,
if you're going to kill me,

07:42.212 --> 07:44.965
bury me in the Lewis
family plot off route six.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.466
We're not gonna kill you.

07:46.550 --> 07:48.510
I just have to leave you
down here for now.

07:48.802 --> 07:52.264
Unless you promise not
to cancel science club?

07:52.347 --> 07:53.473
Not a chance.

07:53.849 --> 07:56.101
Don't you think the school
will ask questions

07:56.185 --> 07:58.061
if I suddenly disappear?

07:58.270 --> 08:01.815
-I'm the Principal.
-He's right.

08:01.899 --> 08:04.151
We need everyone to think
Lewis is still around.

08:04.234 --> 08:05.861
Let's get a fat suit.

08:05.944 --> 08:09.114
I'll be the left side
and you can be the right.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.993
I have a better idea.

08:13.076 --> 08:14.453
Better than the fat suit?

08:24.588 --> 08:26.131
I think we're in
the right place.

09:32.447 --> 09:34.116
It's a Lewis!

09:36.577 --> 09:38.537
Billy, stop being
a perfectionist.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.539
His genitals just aren't
gonna stay on.

09:40.622 --> 09:43.208
So get him dressed and ready
for the school to see him.

09:43.292 --> 09:44.710
Steve, there you are.

09:44.960 --> 09:47.337
What you did with Bartleby
was amazing.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.840
If you liked Bartleby
coming back to life,

09:49.923 --> 09:53.302
how would you feel about
bringing humans back to life?

09:53.385 --> 09:55.304
Oh, I would find that foul.

09:55.387 --> 09:59.016
Whoever's capable of doing
something like that is disgusting.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.476
Shameless. Sacrilegious.

10:01.560 --> 10:04.021
Vile. Just loathsome...

10:04.104 --> 10:06.481
-Awful. Repugnant. I mean like...
-And an all around bad person

10:06.565 --> 10:07.774
-who deserves to rot.
-...this person is terrible.

10:07.858 --> 10:09.109
To rot, yeah. Totally.

10:09.193 --> 10:11.069
Totally. Okay, cool.
Glad we agree.

10:13.822 --> 10:14.948
Well, you gotta go.

10:15.032 --> 10:16.074
Oh.

10:23.165 --> 10:25.042
Everything's riding
on this walk.

10:28.545 --> 10:29.671
Hey, Principal Lewis.

10:31.381 --> 10:33.300
They're buying it.

10:40.682 --> 10:42.643
It worked, but how
do we calm him down?

10:47.064 --> 10:48.440
...on the road

10:48.899 --> 10:52.361
Feelin' lonely and so cold

10:52.444 --> 10:54.988
Gilmore Girls?
And it's the whole series.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.990
Hmm. That'll keep him occupied.

10:57.074 --> 10:59.785
I only watch shows
that begin with "G."

10:59.952 --> 11:03.747
Maybe after I finish Gunsmoke,
I'll check this out.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.291
This or Golumbo.

11:06.375 --> 11:08.210
Oh, Billy, Billy.

11:08.293 --> 11:10.546
I have to spell you
some terrible news.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.966
Yay! Clam chowder day!

11:14.258 --> 11:16.385
Mm. Ow! Too hot!

11:16.468 --> 11:19.263
You didn't blow on it first,
you monsters?

11:19.346 --> 11:20.806
Speaking of monsters,

11:20.889 --> 11:22.975
we created a Frankenstein
version of you,

11:23.058 --> 11:24.309
and everybody bought it.

11:24.601 --> 11:27.062
He can only grunt
and smash things, so...

11:27.145 --> 11:28.438
people thought it was you.

11:28.522 --> 11:31.567
Hmm. You've got it
all figured out, don't you?

11:31.650 --> 11:33.735
Except for one little problem.

11:34.069 --> 11:37.656
Tomorrow is my Halloween Boo Brunch
with the superintendent.

11:37.739 --> 11:40.659
It's all easy, breezy chit-chat.

11:40.742 --> 11:44.371
No way your grunting imitation
Lewis can pass that test.

11:52.713 --> 11:54.089
No more Gilmore Girls.

11:54.173 --> 11:56.049
We gotta teach you
English overnight.

11:56.133 --> 11:57.843
Me want coffee.

11:57.926 --> 12:00.721
Can have coffee with my coffee?

12:00.929 --> 12:04.099
He's learning English
from Gilmore Girls!

12:04.183 --> 12:05.184
Great!

12:05.267 --> 12:09.229
Gilmore Girls is notorious
for being an easy, breezy chatty show.

12:09.313 --> 12:11.023
It's perfect for the Boo Brunch!

12:11.231 --> 12:12.858
Say something
effortlessly charming.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.651
Kill!

12:14.735 --> 12:16.320
Hmm, not black tie ready.

12:16.403 --> 12:19.031
We'll keep him here watching
Gilmore Girls overnight.

12:19.114 --> 12:20.490
I'll go get us some food.

12:20.574 --> 12:22.868
I've got an in
with one of the lunch ladies.

12:22.951 --> 12:25.913
She says she likes how much
mashed potatoes I can eat.

12:28.832 --> 12:31.084
Steve, I've been waiting
in the lab.

12:31.168 --> 12:33.837
Are you blowing me off
to hang out with the principal?

12:33.921 --> 12:36.673
Of course not.
The door's just closing.

12:43.805 --> 12:47.476
Happy Halloween Week, everyone.

12:47.809 --> 12:50.896
May your demon chains
rattle you to the core.

12:51.146 --> 12:54.900
The CEO of
Octa Dual Formaldehyde is here

12:54.983 --> 12:57.986
to answer questions
about the alleged leak...

12:58.070 --> 12:59.738
Mrs. Harriet Bustax.

13:01.740 --> 13:04.159
Well, what a surprise.
It's Roger.

13:04.243 --> 13:05.994
Thank you for allowing me
to speak.

13:06.078 --> 13:07.079
-Boo!
-Criminal!

13:07.162 --> 13:08.163
-Liar!
-Ya suck!

13:08.247 --> 13:10.624
Let's give her a chance
to explain.

13:10.707 --> 13:13.293
She bribed me
with a huge bribe.

13:13.377 --> 13:15.295
What's happening is
we're deliberately

13:15.379 --> 13:17.464
pouring formaldehyde
into the ground

13:17.548 --> 13:20.133
because disposing of it properly
is a whole to-do.

13:20.217 --> 13:22.845
The people of Langley Falls
will not stand for this!

13:22.928 --> 13:24.513
Can I just say one thing?

13:24.596 --> 13:27.516
What if formaldehyde
were good for you?

13:27.599 --> 13:29.142
I'll admit that is convincing.

13:29.226 --> 13:30.644
But how do we know
you aren't lying?

13:30.727 --> 13:33.730
If I were lying,
would I drink the tap water myself?

13:37.359 --> 13:39.528
She likes it so much
she pissed herself!

13:39.611 --> 13:41.572
That's what I do
when I like something.

13:41.655 --> 13:42.698
Me, too.

13:45.409 --> 13:47.119
Wanna get out of here
and go to...

13:47.202 --> 13:49.162
The Sbarro
in the food court?

13:51.123 --> 13:53.166
Who wants formaldehyde swag?

13:59.840 --> 14:03.260
Someone inject this
into my veins.

14:03.468 --> 14:05.220
Is that show
just about coffee?

14:05.304 --> 14:07.514
The superintendent is here!

14:07.598 --> 14:09.391
Okay, Frankenlewis, remember,

14:09.474 --> 14:12.352
you need to talk about things
that aren't just coffee related.

14:12.436 --> 14:16.106
Okay. What is family?

14:16.190 --> 14:18.609
I think he's struggling
to understand

14:18.692 --> 14:22.237
some of the more complex
themes of Gilmore Girls.

14:22.321 --> 14:25.574
I, Rory, and you, Lorelai.

14:25.657 --> 14:28.410
We go to Luke's Diner,

14:28.493 --> 14:32.289
you teach me about love
and private school.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.458
Yeah, that's not gonna
be possible.

14:36.668 --> 14:39.213
Luke's Diner or no Boo Brunch!

14:40.380 --> 14:41.882
Brian,
are you ready for me?

14:41.965 --> 14:45.093
Okay. Do this for us and we'll
take you to Luke's Diner.

14:45.177 --> 14:46.220
I promise.

14:47.930 --> 14:50.224
Enter, soup-tendent!

14:50.974 --> 14:53.310
Brian, you look terrible,
practically dead.

14:54.186 --> 14:56.313
I love that
you're always on theme.

14:56.396 --> 14:57.940
You want coffee?

14:58.023 --> 14:59.066
And keep it coming.

14:59.149 --> 15:00.484
Yes!

15:03.904 --> 15:04.905
So, what's up?

15:04.988 --> 15:07.324
Well, I'm a monster.

15:07.908 --> 15:08.909
We're screwed.

15:08.992 --> 15:10.536
You think you're a monster?

15:10.619 --> 15:14.122
You should see how impatient
I am with my mother on the phone.

15:14.456 --> 15:16.416
Also, I'm always adopting dogs

15:16.500 --> 15:18.627
and putting them right back
on the street.

15:18.710 --> 15:22.297
Speaking of dogs, I saw Snoop Dogg
at the grocery store maybe.

15:23.048 --> 15:25.467
And that was my first
slice of bread.

15:26.176 --> 15:29.847
Three hours later, we were
making love in a motel room.

15:30.097 --> 15:32.558
A mouthwatering tryst,
my friend.

15:32.766 --> 15:35.435
-Time to go!
-Well, feels like it's time to go.

15:38.313 --> 15:41.859
Wait, I just realized I haven't
asked anything about you, Brian.

15:42.150 --> 15:43.318
Oh, no.

15:43.402 --> 15:44.570
Ah, well.

15:44.653 --> 15:45.821
Next year.

15:45.988 --> 15:47.489
Bye, bitch.

15:47.948 --> 15:49.825
Ha-ha.
That trick was a treat.

15:51.785 --> 15:52.953
We did it!

15:53.078 --> 15:54.538
We got through
the Boo Brunch,

15:54.621 --> 15:56.790
and now I can have
science club with Snot!

15:56.874 --> 15:59.084
You promise Luke's Diner.

15:59.168 --> 16:00.544
No time, Franky baby.

16:00.627 --> 16:03.172
-Maybe later.
-You break promise.

16:03.463 --> 16:04.840
You be sorry!

16:04.923 --> 16:06.717
Oh, yeah?
What are you gonna do?

16:06.925 --> 16:08.760
Use your superhuman
brute strength

16:08.844 --> 16:10.345
to kidnap my best friend Snot

16:10.429 --> 16:13.182
who is playing unsupervised
on the front lawn right now?

16:13.265 --> 16:15.058
Well, if that's what
you're thinking,

16:15.142 --> 16:16.185
you can forget about it.

16:22.149 --> 16:24.484
Toshi, w-w-what happened?

16:24.568 --> 16:26.069
Principal Lewis went mad!

16:26.153 --> 16:28.280
He ran over here,
knocked all of us down,

16:28.363 --> 16:30.532
threw Snot over his shoulders,
and ran off.

16:30.616 --> 16:32.451
I think I asked Toshi,

16:32.534 --> 16:34.870
but I don't have time
to scold you on manners.

16:34.953 --> 16:37.497
And now I don't even have time
to listen to Toshi.

16:37.581 --> 16:38.832
I'm coming, Snot!

16:42.669 --> 16:45.339
Billy!
Frankenlewis took Snot!

16:45.422 --> 16:47.966
We have to find him!
He... He could be anywhere!

16:48.050 --> 16:50.636
I'm with you 'til the end,
Steve.

16:52.095 --> 16:53.972
Billy! In the car!

16:54.056 --> 16:56.892
I know you stole
those schematics!

16:57.059 --> 16:58.268
I'm out, Steve.

17:01.355 --> 17:04.107
That's right!
You better run!

17:05.067 --> 17:06.318
Oh, Smith.

17:06.527 --> 17:10.072
Has everything fallen to pieces
and now you need me?

17:10.155 --> 17:13.075
-Yes.
-It has? I was just guessing!

17:13.158 --> 17:16.245
Frankenlewis stole Snot
a-and ran off,

17:16.328 --> 17:17.454
and I don't know
where he went.

17:17.538 --> 17:19.998
If anyone knows how to track
a bunch of dead Lewises,

17:20.082 --> 17:21.625
it's an alive Lewis.

17:21.959 --> 17:24.628
-Let me out of here.
-But you're gonna punish me.

17:24.711 --> 17:27.297
You could even have me
arrested for what I did.

17:27.381 --> 17:28.382
Arrested?

17:28.465 --> 17:30.634
The only thing
you've done wrong is prevent me

17:30.717 --> 17:33.220
from feeding the man
I have locked in my basement.

17:34.179 --> 17:36.557
You said he wanted
to meet you at Luke's Diner?

17:36.640 --> 17:38.141
He's going to Stars Hollow.

17:38.225 --> 17:39.852
The town from the show?

17:40.102 --> 17:41.520
That's not a real place.

17:41.603 --> 17:43.272
No, it's not a real town.

17:43.689 --> 17:45.983
But I know where it would be
if it did exist.

17:47.860 --> 17:50.529
In the pilot, Rory starts
a new school in Hartford,

17:50.612 --> 17:52.990
which Lorelai claims
is a half-hour bus ride

17:53.073 --> 17:54.283
from Stars Hollow.

17:54.366 --> 17:55.450
-Now, that could be...
-Look,

17:55.534 --> 17:56.910
I'm not gonna find
this explanation

17:56.994 --> 17:58.704
as impressive as you think I am.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.794
Whoa. Are you guys
drinking that formaldehyde?

18:05.878 --> 18:07.379
It's bad for you.

18:07.462 --> 18:08.964
Trick or treat!

18:10.883 --> 18:12.259
This is a disaster!

18:12.509 --> 18:14.219
I've got to save Halloween!

18:14.386 --> 18:18.056
And the first step
is the ultimate costume!

18:18.140 --> 18:20.184
I'm gonna try some things on.
You guys sit tight.

18:20.267 --> 18:21.768
I'll be back in 40.

18:22.144 --> 18:23.896
Someone get the door!

18:23.979 --> 18:24.980
Jesus!

18:29.151 --> 18:30.152
This is it.

18:30.402 --> 18:32.196
The location of Stars Hollow

18:32.279 --> 18:33.488
if it were a real place

18:33.572 --> 18:35.324
and not just a song
in our hearts.

18:46.919 --> 18:48.170
What is this?

18:48.253 --> 18:50.255
He's building a real
Stars Hollow.

18:50.464 --> 18:52.424
This is Luke's diner,
and over there's

18:52.508 --> 18:54.259
the gazebo
in the middle of town.

18:54.551 --> 18:57.137
And here's the barn
Miss Patty teaches dance in.

18:58.305 --> 18:59.723
And there's Frankenlewis!

19:04.269 --> 19:06.480
Frankenlewis,
please calm down.

19:06.855 --> 19:08.607
Di... Did you hurt Snot?

19:08.690 --> 19:09.983
I'm up here, Steve!

19:10.859 --> 19:14.279
You promise Frankenlewis
coffee at Luke's.

19:14.363 --> 19:17.032
You break promise for that boy.

19:17.115 --> 19:18.951
He is your Rory.

19:19.034 --> 19:21.495
But I should be Rory.

19:25.749 --> 19:28.377
You have coffee with me now.

19:28.794 --> 19:30.963
Ask how school was today.

19:31.046 --> 19:33.090
H-H-How was school today?

19:33.173 --> 19:35.217
I don't know what school is!

19:35.384 --> 19:39.304
Why did you create me
only to suffer?

19:39.388 --> 19:41.265
I didn't mean
for you to suffer!

19:41.348 --> 19:43.892
I was just trying to save
my friendship with Snot!

19:44.184 --> 19:45.477
Save our friendship?

19:45.561 --> 19:49.481
Steve, honey,
our friendship's not in danger.

19:49.565 --> 19:51.692
Then why did you
join croquet club?

19:51.775 --> 19:53.235
It's a fun game.

19:53.318 --> 19:55.070
Maybe you should join, too.

19:55.153 --> 19:57.406
'Cause looking around,
I don't think science

19:57.489 --> 19:58.866
is the best thing for you.

19:58.949 --> 20:00.909
I guess I did overreact
a little bit.

20:01.118 --> 20:02.202
It's just...

20:02.369 --> 20:03.912
you are the most important...

20:03.996 --> 20:08.166
No! Don't have Gilmo moment
with Snot!

20:08.542 --> 20:12.087
Have Gilmo moment
with Frankenlewis!

20:15.215 --> 20:19.219
You be my Lorelai or die!

20:19.303 --> 20:20.512
I can't!

20:20.596 --> 20:22.848
I've never seen the show!

20:23.807 --> 20:26.268
Then you die!

20:26.351 --> 20:27.436
Stop!

20:27.936 --> 20:29.855
I'll be your Lorelai.

20:30.105 --> 20:32.608
You? Why?

20:32.691 --> 20:34.860
You're a bunch of my
dead relatives dug up

20:34.943 --> 20:36.236
and sewn back together.

20:36.320 --> 20:38.405
That basically makes you
my daughter.

20:38.655 --> 20:42.993
Mm. Gilmo momo.

20:44.536 --> 20:47.581
Frankenlewis, I'm sorry
I didn't consider your feelings

20:47.664 --> 20:49.458
as you slowly began
to develop them.

20:49.541 --> 20:50.584
Thank you.

20:50.792 --> 20:54.004
That mean world to Frankenlewis.

20:54.796 --> 20:57.174
There's still a couple hours
left in Halloween.

20:57.257 --> 20:59.426
Who wants to ride around
in my monster truck

20:59.510 --> 21:00.802
and scare sweet children?

21:00.886 --> 21:02.054
Yeah!

21:02.262 --> 21:03.889
Bye! Have a great time!
