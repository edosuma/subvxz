The Simpsons S19E19 (KABF12)
Mona Leaves-a

00:13.992 --> 00:16.260
This punishment is not medieval.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:43.766 --> 01:44.835
Hey.

01:56.529 --> 01:59.145
What took you so long?

02:11.833 --> 02:13.198
Excuse me.

02:13.199 --> 02:16.257
- Are you leaving?
- No, sorry.

02:16.854 --> 02:18.018
I'm not leaving.

02:18.795 --> 02:20.266
Sorry, not leaving.

02:20.924 --> 02:22.336
Not quite yet.

02:22.928 --> 02:24.180
I'm sorry.

02:24.921 --> 02:25.942
I'm not leaving.

02:25.941 --> 02:27.264
So what are you doing?

02:27.262 --> 02:28.983
Oh, I like creating disappointment.

02:28.989 --> 02:31.213
You know that little moment
where people's hope dies?

02:31.226 --> 02:32.492
I feed on that.

02:34.147 --> 02:35.713
Uh, is this space free?

02:35.717 --> 02:37.161
You know as a matter of fact...

02:37.318 --> 02:38.322
it ain't!

02:39.727 --> 02:41.403
Ahh, that's heavenly.

02:41.446 --> 02:42.772
Sweaters, not
the fun cartoon

02:47.758 --> 02:49.752
Mom, you tricked us!

02:49.756 --> 02:52.180
We thought this was going
to be a fun trip to the mall!

02:52.187 --> 02:54.703
We listed to music radio
in the car.

02:55.465 --> 02:57.051
And since you kids behaved,

02:57.057 --> 02:59.430
we'll pick one fun thing
to do here.

02:59.437 --> 03:01.513
I want to go lecture the
food court businesses

03:01.516 --> 03:03.502
that are still using Styrofoam.

03:03.507 --> 03:05.663
Lead-based toys!
Lead-based toys!

03:05.665 --> 03:07.373
Sit on a bench!
Sit on a bench!

03:10.237 --> 03:13.203
For once, we'll do what
Maggie wants.

03:17.198 --> 03:18.952
Oh, Maggie's thing?

03:18.965 --> 03:21.172
She won't even remember
that we did it!

03:21.185 --> 03:22.923
None of you kids ever remember any

03:22.925 --> 03:24.620
of the nice things we do for you.

03:24.628 --> 03:26.102
- Like what?
- Food.

03:26.107 --> 03:27.283
- Pass.
- Shelter?

03:27.296 --> 03:28.812
- That dump?!
- Clothing?

03:28.816 --> 03:30.900
I wouldn't blow my nose into this.

03:35.888 --> 03:37.333
Welcome to Stuff-N-Hug,

03:37.337 --> 03:38.940
a Funworks Lovelab!

03:38.945 --> 03:41.463
I'm used to buying
my critters pre-made.

03:41.506 --> 03:43.242
How does your store differ?

03:43.245 --> 03:44.610
Why should I tell you,

03:44.616 --> 03:47.021
when we've got a video
that shows you!

03:49.818 --> 03:52.023
Video's broken, Alan!

03:52.027 --> 03:53.060
Call Eric!

03:53.065 --> 03:54.103
I'm Eric!

03:54.166 --> 03:55.400
Black Eric!

03:56.536 --> 03:57.840
I want a poodle.

03:57.846 --> 03:59.713
I'd stay away from poodles.

03:59.715 --> 04:01.053
They give the dog...

04:01.057 --> 04:02.620
ideas.

04:05.267 --> 04:07.923
How much love do you want
in your Stuff-N-Hug?

04:07.928 --> 04:09.822
I want all the love.

04:14.416 --> 04:15.980
Snow day!

04:18.356 --> 04:19.741
So little girl,

04:19.757 --> 04:21.481
what outfit do you want
for your dolphin?

04:21.487 --> 04:23.411
- Doctor.
- Okay...

04:23.466 --> 04:24.700
nurse it is.

04:24.795 --> 04:25.710
Professor.

04:25.715 --> 04:27.261
- Kindergarten teacher.
- Chef!

04:27.266 --> 04:28.583
- Lunch lady!
- CEO!

04:28.585 --> 04:30.741
Secretary to a CEO.

04:30.745 --> 04:33.172
You know,
it's a boy dolphin.

04:33.177 --> 04:34.391
Oh...

04:34.397 --> 04:36.950
here you go, Doctor.

04:39.887 --> 04:41.381
We fooled her....

04:41.397 --> 04:42.521
Betsy.

04:44.935 --> 04:46.430
Bart is awesome.

04:46.858 --> 04:48.362
Bart is awesome.

04:48.377 --> 04:51.043
Wow, this guy could put
Milhouse out of business.

04:52.967 --> 04:53.933
Oh,

04:54.548 --> 04:56.882
well, this is kind
of a cute outfit.

04:58.627 --> 04:59.850
Homer is a lard butt.

04:59.846 --> 05:01.921
- What did you say?
- Homer has booger breath.

05:01.925 --> 05:04.543
- It's a medical condition!
- Homer is a big jerk.

05:04.558 --> 05:06.263
Who told you these
things about me?

05:06.267 --> 05:07.643
Dung muncher.
Stink brains.

05:07.647 --> 05:08.983
Cheese wang.
Captain Crud.

05:08.986 --> 05:10.840
I don't want to get mad,
but I will!

05:10.846 --> 05:12.140
B.O. Baracus. Mount Baldy.

05:12.148 --> 05:13.602
Tub of Guts.
Crapper Clogger.

05:13.606 --> 05:14.580
Oh, that's it!

05:14.586 --> 05:16.552
Uh, Mom, we got a code four.

05:18.455 --> 05:20.710
I'll kill you all!

05:24.767 --> 05:26.772
It didn't have
to go down like this!

05:32.298 --> 05:33.643
The door's open!

05:33.647 --> 05:35.180
I think someone broke in!

05:35.186 --> 05:37.062
Don't worry.
I'm ready for this.

05:37.067 --> 05:39.383
Bart, fetch "The Defender."

05:39.387 --> 05:40.441
Yes, sir!

05:52.197 --> 05:54.743
I hear noises coming
from the kitchen.

05:54.746 --> 05:56.611
Uh-oh, that's where
the food sleeps.

06:02.446 --> 06:03.571
Wait a minute.

06:03.576 --> 06:06.153
I smell apples, cinnamon,.......

06:06.235 --> 06:07.480
crust.

06:07.515 --> 06:08.802
It's a pie!

06:08.826 --> 06:11.692
Why would a robber make pie?

06:11.715 --> 06:13.001
Who cares?

06:13.008 --> 06:14.672
If you kill him,
we'll be on TV!

06:14.677 --> 06:15.672
You're right, boy!

06:18.465 --> 06:20.153
Hmm? Mom!

06:21.775 --> 06:23.223
My aquarium!

06:23.225 --> 06:24.331
Hello, Homer.

06:24.337 --> 06:25.451
You're alive!

06:25.457 --> 06:26.910
And you baked a pie!

06:26.917 --> 06:28.770
Homie, what's going on?

06:28.778 --> 06:30.060
I'm fighting the robber!

06:30.067 --> 06:31.183
You go get ice cream!

06:31.206 --> 06:33.192
Mom, I can't believe
you're here.

06:33.197 --> 06:34.390
You keep disappearing and

06:34.408 --> 06:35.883
reappearing and it's not funny.

06:35.885 --> 06:37.852
You're just like that show Scrubs.

06:38.168 --> 06:41.082
Homer, I'm sorry I had
to pretend to be dead.

06:41.108 --> 06:44.771
But it worked because the government
isn't looking for me anymore.

06:44.776 --> 06:48.531
I can finally stop running
and be your mom.

06:51.965 --> 06:53.040
No, thanks.

06:53.046 --> 06:54.211
What do you mean?

06:54.217 --> 06:56.350
Every time you go,
I feel abandoned.

06:56.358 --> 06:57.523
But not this time.

06:57.526 --> 07:00.262
I'm not gonna let myself get hurt.

07:00.318 --> 07:04.381
Homer, I'm through protesting
and chaining myself to things.

07:04.386 --> 07:06.651
I've realized that
the most important

07:06.656 --> 07:08.591
thing in my life is you.

07:08.598 --> 07:09.991
That's what your mouth says,

07:09.997 --> 07:11.761
but my ears are too smart
to believe it.

07:11.767 --> 07:14.932
In fact, I don't even
want your pie.

07:14.948 --> 07:16.603
You already ate
the whole thing.

07:16.606 --> 07:19.570
Well, I'm not going
to digest it!

07:27.377 --> 07:30.481
Wow, Dad was so cute as a baby.

07:30.485 --> 07:32.151
When did he lose his cuteness?

07:32.156 --> 07:35.212
Oh, I have a picture
of that right here.

07:39.136 --> 07:43.072
I do feel bad for missing so much
of Homer's childhood.

07:43.077 --> 07:45.361
But at least he wasn't raised
by a television.

07:48.778 --> 07:50.070
See you later, honey.

07:50.078 --> 07:53.042
Mommy has to go chain herself
to a nuclear submarine.

07:53.047 --> 07:54.383
Hugs and kisses!

08:07.026 --> 08:09.992
You left a hole in heart
that could never be filled.

08:09.998 --> 08:11.970
So I filled it with food.

08:11.976 --> 08:14.042
But I'm never full.

08:15.408 --> 08:17.672
Welcome back to the ESPY Awards.

08:17.706 --> 08:19.192
Our next presenters are

08:19.196 --> 08:21.720
Lance Armstrong
and Fozzie Bear.

08:21.721 --> 08:23.302
Wokka, wokka, wokka!

08:23.301 --> 08:25.084
That's right, Fozzie,
and this year's

08:25.082 --> 08:26.253
Right Guard Keeping Cool

08:26.259 --> 08:27.761
Under Pressure Award goes to...

08:27.768 --> 08:29.320
Hey, Lance, nice trousers.

08:29.327 --> 08:31.383
Did you win those
at the Tour de Pants?

08:31.385 --> 08:32.383
Wokka, wokka!

08:32.385 --> 08:34.482
Yeah, well, I never thought
you were funny.

08:34.485 --> 08:35.520
Ever.

08:35.674 --> 08:37.003
Wokka, wokka!

08:37.686 --> 08:38.919
Wokka, wokka?

08:39.337 --> 08:40.440
Anyway,...

08:40.496 --> 08:41.909
the Right Guard Keeping Cool

08:41.916 --> 08:43.491
Under Pressure Award goes to...

08:43.498 --> 08:45.010
Oh, I don't even care.

08:45.018 --> 08:46.020
Homer?

08:46.107 --> 08:48.593
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

08:48.618 --> 08:50.282
It's my feelings that are mad.

08:50.295 --> 08:53.013
Oh, sweetheart, when I left you,
it was because

08:53.348 --> 08:56.033
I thought I could make
the world a little bit better.

08:56.045 --> 08:59.723
Maybe all I did was make
my own world a lot worse.

08:59.738 --> 09:01.803
I only hope you
can forgive me.

09:01.808 --> 09:03.352
No!
I can't forgive you.

09:03.355 --> 09:05.632
And I don't accept your tuck-in!

09:08.335 --> 09:09.633
I understand.

09:09.656 --> 09:11.431
These things take time.

09:12.837 --> 09:13.951
Good night.

09:20.407 --> 09:22.163
Oh, I feel terrible.

09:22.168 --> 09:25.320
My own mother reached out to me,
and I rejected her.

09:25.325 --> 09:27.020
I'm gonna make her a card.

09:29.327 --> 09:30.823
Mom?

09:32.285 --> 09:33.750
Are you asleep?

09:34.407 --> 09:36.773
Asleep with your eyes open?

09:37.137 --> 09:38.271
Mom?

09:39.685 --> 09:41.062
Mom?!

09:46.725 --> 09:48.853
My mother's dead.

09:49.617 --> 09:51.570
I'm still with you, son.

09:51.575 --> 09:54.612
Oh, this just gets
worse and worse!

09:55.797 --> 10:00.061
After your mother left me, I always
planned to dance on her grave.

10:00.065 --> 10:01.853
First, it was gonna be
the Hustle.

10:01.855 --> 10:04.140
Recently, I've been taking
tap lessons.

10:04.147 --> 10:05.252
But now?

10:05.256 --> 10:08.453
Well, I don't feel
much like dancing.

10:14.266 --> 10:15.723
Come on, Homie.

10:15.738 --> 10:18.803
Your mom wouldn't have wanted
you to stay in bed forever.

10:18.805 --> 10:20.331
I'll tell you what
she didn't want.

10:20.345 --> 10:23.351
Me to be a jerk to her
and then she dies.

10:24.305 --> 10:26.391
Say something comforting.

10:26.395 --> 10:28.772
Okay, comforting,
comforting.

10:28.775 --> 10:30.142
Uh, Dad,

10:30.146 --> 10:32.102
whenever I would hang
out with Grandma,

10:32.107 --> 10:34.142
she would always ask me about you.

10:34.147 --> 10:35.752
And I'd say you suck.

10:35.758 --> 10:38.663
And she would say
you don't suck that bad.

10:38.665 --> 10:40.891
She said I didn't suck?

10:40.893 --> 10:41.986
That bad.

10:41.987 --> 10:43.916
That bad.

10:43.917 --> 10:45.858
- Wow.
- Yeah.

10:46.643 --> 10:48.442
Sorry about your ma, Homer.

10:48.443 --> 10:51.401
I just wish she hadn't died
thinking I hated her.

10:51.402 --> 10:54.227
Yeah, you should always make
peace with your loved ones.

10:54.228 --> 10:56.636
I think I'll give my ma
a call right now.

10:58.923 --> 11:01.633
Hey, Mom, I just wanted you
to know that you mean...

11:01.850 --> 11:02.988
Yeah, he's here.

11:03.027 --> 11:04.320
Hey, Mrs. L.

11:04.321 --> 11:06.142
Those butter cookies
you sent were tasty.

11:06.151 --> 11:08.004
And the almond ones,
oh!

11:08.192 --> 11:10.513
Aw, I wish I was your son, too.

11:10.519 --> 11:12.201
All right,
I'm gonna pass you back...

11:12.205 --> 11:14.193
Okay, okay, I'll tell him.

11:14.327 --> 11:16.910
Uh, Moe, Lenny's mom
says she loves you.

11:19.958 --> 11:22.941
Apu, what do you think happens
after you die?

11:22.946 --> 11:24.483
Manjula will sell the store,

11:24.495 --> 11:27.111
dye her hair blonde,
and marry my cousin Jangelvar.

11:27.117 --> 11:28.401
Yes, I will.

11:28.418 --> 11:31.142
I mean, do you think my mother's
out there somewhere?

11:31.147 --> 11:33.981
Does she know I feel bad
about things I said?

11:33.987 --> 11:35.823
Perhaps she's around us now.

11:35.827 --> 11:38.422
She may have already
been reincarnated as...

11:38.426 --> 11:39.993
that newborn baby or...

11:40.008 --> 11:42.081
that tiny mouse
in the nacho cheese.

11:42.088 --> 11:44.721
Oh, for crying out loud,
people aren't mice.

11:44.728 --> 11:46.410
Oh, what a surprise.

11:46.418 --> 11:49.460
Joe Jesus, Junior is going
to set us all straight.

11:49.468 --> 11:51.822
Look, Homer, people don't
come back as anything,

11:51.826 --> 11:53.670
except for our Lord,
who came back as bread.

11:53.676 --> 11:55.622
- That's it.
- That's it.

11:59.725 --> 12:02.381
That's the thing with your religion:
it's a bummer.

12:02.387 --> 12:03.522
Even the sing-alongs?

12:03.525 --> 12:05.072
No, the sing-alongs are okay.

12:05.925 --> 12:09.150
Homer, look what I found
with your mother's things

12:10.295 --> 12:11.953
A donut from the future?

12:15.328 --> 12:18.753
The following video was recorded
at Garry's Video Wills.

12:18.758 --> 12:22.482
Maggie, that's the same Garry
that filmed your birthday party.

12:22.498 --> 12:26.130
Remember,he brought his girlfriend
and they got in a fight?

12:26.828 --> 12:27.930
Hello, Homer.

12:27.935 --> 12:30.773
If you are watching this right now,
I am dead.

12:30.785 --> 12:32.913
Or if I'm nodead,
you've gotten in to my stuff.

12:32.917 --> 12:34.783
But if I am dead,
this is my will.

12:34.795 --> 12:37.003
And if I'm not,
get out of my stuff.

12:38.065 --> 12:40.022
To my grandson Bart,

12:40.026 --> 12:42.470
I leave my Swiss Army knife.

12:42.478 --> 12:43.443
Cool.

12:43.447 --> 12:45.010
My dearest Lisa,

12:45.027 --> 12:47.801
I leave you a priceless
item so powerful

12:47.817 --> 12:50.223
no government can ever extinguish it:

12:50.227 --> 12:52.153
my rebellious spirit

12:52.157 --> 12:54.713
Grandma, I accept your gift.

12:54.716 --> 12:57.440
You got nothing,
you got nothing.

12:57.448 --> 12:59.643
Marge, I have a purse
for you.

12:59.647 --> 13:04.133
It's woven out of nature's
most amazing material: hemp.

13:06.038 --> 13:08.560
Hmm, it smells like concerts.

13:08.568 --> 13:11.061
And lastly,
for Homer,

13:11.068 --> 13:13.643
I leave you something
very special.

13:14.478 --> 13:15.840
A difficult task.

13:16.488 --> 13:19.721
Go to Springfield Monument Park
and climb to the highest point.

13:19.738 --> 13:22.851
At exactly 3:00,
release my ashes.

13:23.227 --> 13:25.060
I love you, Homer.

13:25.317 --> 13:27.001
And now,
because they're your favorite,

13:27.005 --> 13:29.303
please enjoy some animal bloopers.

13:29.317 --> 13:32.403
Aw, Ma, you always knew just how
to make everything all right.

13:36.285 --> 13:38.723
Oh, it works on so many levels.

13:48.988 --> 13:50.241
Okay, this is it.

13:50.247 --> 13:53.580
I've got one last chance to make up
for the things I said to my mom.

13:53.588 --> 13:55.750
I will avenge you.

13:55.757 --> 13:57.403
It's not really avenging her, Dad,

13:57.405 --> 13:59.251
just the fulfillment
of her last wish.

13:59.257 --> 14:01.370
I'm really glad you
corrected me, Lisa.

14:01.375 --> 14:04.930
People are always really glad
when they're corrected.

14:08.278 --> 14:10.480
This is hard work.
Isn't it, boy?

14:11.727 --> 14:13.450
- Boy?
- Hey, Homer!

14:13.457 --> 14:15.961
Your butt still looks big
from down here!

14:15.967 --> 14:18.583
Why, you little...!

14:21.275 --> 14:23.973
You know,
spiritually speaking,

14:23.975 --> 14:27.842
Grandma's ashes won't know where
they've been thrown from, so...

14:28.166 --> 14:30.290
in a way...

14:30.295 --> 14:31.961
I'm lying down now.

14:33.618 --> 14:35.540
I always knew that at the end,

14:35.545 --> 14:37.612
it would all come down to me.

14:37.618 --> 14:40.632
Excuse me, I think I'm holding
up better than you are.

14:40.648 --> 14:43.231
In fact, I've got energy to spare.

14:43.237 --> 14:45.301
Hmm, to spare, eh?

14:46.428 --> 14:48.712
Marge, your back is so sweaty.

14:48.718 --> 14:50.260
I'm starting to slip off.

14:54.446 --> 14:56.070
That's the highest point.

14:56.566 --> 14:58.561
And only 15 minutes to go.

15:23.658 --> 15:24.680
Made it.

15:27.608 --> 15:30.501
Mom, we didn't know
each other very well.

15:30.508 --> 15:33.833
If we did, you never would have
asked me to climb anything,

15:33.838 --> 15:35.531
but even when you
weren't around,

15:35.535 --> 15:39.213
I always felt good knowing
you were out there somewhere.

15:41.247 --> 15:42.401
3:00.

15:43.308 --> 15:44.500
Good-bye, Mom.

15:44.507 --> 15:46.221
You're finally free.

15:49.697 --> 15:50.661
Huh?

15:55.505 --> 15:57.132
Guidance system destroyed.

15:57.237 --> 15:59.092
Launch aborted.

16:02.685 --> 16:04.723
Wait a minute.

16:04.728 --> 16:07.550
Mom's ashes stopped
that missile launch.

16:07.555 --> 16:08.522
Mom.

16:08.526 --> 16:12.002
You used me to pull one more
stupid hippie protest.

16:12.008 --> 16:13.260
Didn't you?

16:13.267 --> 16:16.710
Judging from the wind direction,
distance, time of day,

16:16.745 --> 16:19.352
the ashes must have come from...

16:19.406 --> 16:20.280
him.

16:20.285 --> 16:24.342
Ugh, ever since you started watching
Monk, you think you are Monk.

16:24.347 --> 16:25.172
You're not Monk.

16:26.965 --> 16:28.561
Uh-oh, I got to get
out of here.

16:33.078 --> 16:37.570
I'm stayin' as long as nothing disturbs
this incredibly delicate balance.

16:43.907 --> 16:45.603
You're not supposed
to like it.

16:45.607 --> 16:47.451
Show me the law
that says I can't.

16:50.377 --> 16:51.292
Are you hurt?

16:51.298 --> 16:52.520
I don't think so.

16:52.835 --> 16:54.211
So we got to do that, too.

17:06.454 --> 17:07.920
Here's your mother.

17:09.108 --> 17:11.961
You can have her.
To me, she's been nothing but trouble.

17:11.965 --> 17:13.282
What's the delay?

17:13.288 --> 17:14.953
Mr. Burns,
we had a saboteur.

17:14.955 --> 17:16.690
Well, well, well.

17:16.694 --> 17:19.001
Who's this delightful
young lady?

17:19.026 --> 17:21.031
She's what held up
the launch, sir.

17:21.038 --> 17:23.660
Pity. You and I could have
shared the world.

17:23.675 --> 17:26.101
You do know you're talking
to a bag of ashes.

17:26.117 --> 17:29.631
Hey, I've seen your wife.
She's no Mamie Van Doren.

17:30.187 --> 17:32.690
Just what are you guys up to?

17:32.698 --> 17:34.911
Oh, I suppose there's no
harmin telling you.

17:34.928 --> 17:38.532
I'm using the rocket to dispose
of Springfield's nuclear waste

17:38.546 --> 17:41.943
by sending it straight to the heart
of the Amazon rainforest.

17:41.947 --> 17:44.020
The rainforest?

17:44.026 --> 17:45.871
That's that thing Lisa likes.

17:45.878 --> 17:49.901
Well, maybe she'll like it better filled
with dying trees and mutated animals.

17:49.907 --> 17:51.290
You monster.

17:51.296 --> 17:52.572
On another subject,

17:52.578 --> 17:54.450
next Thursday I have
to leave work early.

17:54.456 --> 17:55.992
I assume that's cool.

17:56.006 --> 17:58.541
All systems operational.

17:58.546 --> 17:59.782
Excellent.

18:03.606 --> 18:05.270
Mom, I'm so sorry.

18:05.271 --> 18:08.752
You just wanted to stop one more
senseless act of madness in this world.

18:08.751 --> 18:10.084
Well, if I get out of this,

18:10.082 --> 18:12.953
I promise you I'll grant
your last wish.

18:12.959 --> 18:14.490
Homer, hey, Homer.

18:14.496 --> 18:15.731
Here's Grandma's knife.

18:15.736 --> 18:16.962
Toss it down.

18:18.636 --> 18:19.832
Thanks, boy.

18:23.385 --> 18:26.321
How am I ever going
to take on all those guys?

18:29.066 --> 18:32.552
Hmm, what could I make
from those two things?

18:34.838 --> 18:35.872
Mm... no.

18:38.498 --> 18:40.660
My purse is made of hemp.

18:40.665 --> 18:44.543
If we burn it, the silly smoke
will mellow out those guards.

18:44.548 --> 18:47.482
We can ignite it with these crystal
earrings Grandma gave me.

18:47.488 --> 18:50.012
I thought she gave you
her rebellious spirit.

18:50.018 --> 18:52.102
I found them on her nightstand.

18:52.798 --> 18:55.630
What? Bart got
a Swiss Army knife.

18:59.506 --> 19:03.060
<i>One pill makes you larger</i>

19:03.087 --> 19:06.003
<i>And one pill makes you small...</i>

19:06.008 --> 19:07.951
Hey, did you ever
think about how, like,

19:07.955 --> 19:10.820
your fingers are like legs
for your hand?

19:10.825 --> 19:13.051
Imagine what cute little
shoes they'd wear.

19:13.057 --> 19:15.561
That's already a
thing thimbles, right?

19:16.728 --> 19:18.932
God bless America!

19:32.068 --> 19:33.561
Send in reinforcements.

19:33.568 --> 19:35.392
Actually, you only hired ten.

19:35.405 --> 19:36.983
A couple guys called in sick

19:36.987 --> 19:39.140
and the Jewish guy
has to leave at sunset.

19:39.146 --> 19:40.273
Fine.

19:43.306 --> 19:44.720
That'll do, brick.

19:44.765 --> 19:46.103
That'll do.

19:46.108 --> 19:48.602
Base self-destruct
sequence activated.

19:48.605 --> 19:50.091
Detonation in ten,...

19:50.107 --> 19:51.133
nine,...

19:51.136 --> 19:52.291
eight...

19:59.255 --> 20:00.441
Homie.

20:06.636 --> 20:09.043
Now I'll just add water
to these ashes

20:09.045 --> 20:10.951
and bring my mother back to life.

20:10.956 --> 20:13.562
It doesn't work that way, Homie.

20:13.568 --> 20:16.531
But she'll live on forever
in what you did today.

20:16.547 --> 20:19.121
Well, then, Mom,
this was for you.

20:25.015 --> 20:28.843
<i>No, I would not
give you false hope</i>

20:28.945 --> 20:32.691
<i>On this strange
and mournful day</i>

20:32.907 --> 20:36.852
<i>But the mother
and child reunion</i>

20:36.918 --> 20:40.920
<i>Is only a motion away</i>

20:42.535 --> 20:45.131
<i>little darling of mine.</i>

20:45.138 --> 20:47.040
More sugar,
more sugar.

20:47.107 --> 20:48.941
- No.
- Why not?

20:48.947 --> 20:51.941
Because you're sweet enough.
