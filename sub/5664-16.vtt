00:00.089 --> 00:01.923
<i>Previously on</i> Sleepy Hollow...

00:01.924 --> 00:04.659
PANDORA: <i>There are fates
worse than death, Abbie.</i>

00:04.660 --> 00:07.544
<i>How long will you be able
to stand the solitude?</i>

00:07.545 --> 00:08.681
Betsy Ross?

00:08.682 --> 00:09.548
The flag woman?

00:09.549 --> 00:11.217
<i>Betsy...</i>

00:11.218 --> 00:12.785
was a woman of many talents.

00:12.786 --> 00:13.786
ABBIE: <i>Betsy and Crane...</i>

00:13.787 --> 00:15.388
<i>kind of were a thing.</i>

00:15.389 --> 00:16.522
You know why I fell in love with you

00:16.523 --> 00:17.623
back when we were new agents

00:17.624 --> 00:19.258
- in training?
- You love me?

00:19.259 --> 00:20.576
You never said that before.

00:20.577 --> 00:22.261
I care about you, Abs.

00:22.262 --> 00:23.563
I found Dad.

00:23.564 --> 00:25.031
You want to reconnect
with that deadbeat?

00:25.032 --> 00:26.766
(scoffs) Go ahead.

00:26.767 --> 00:29.101
You're not actually thinking
of working with Pandora?

00:29.102 --> 00:31.370
<i>We need to save Crane,
and she's the only one</i>

00:31.371 --> 00:33.363
<i>who has any idea how
to break through this barrier.</i>

00:33.364 --> 00:34.941
PANDORA: I knew you had the Emblem,

00:34.942 --> 00:36.576
and I did not tell him.

00:36.577 --> 00:38.110
We have much to discuss,

00:38.111 --> 00:40.079
Pandora. We can start

00:40.080 --> 00:41.881
with the truth.

00:45.218 --> 00:47.787
The fault lies with me, really.

00:47.788 --> 00:51.324
I was far too indulgent.

00:51.325 --> 00:55.661
Allowed you to become too familiar,

00:55.662 --> 00:57.296
like a house pet

00:57.297 --> 00:58.898
that has come to expect feasts,

00:58.899 --> 01:01.601
rather than table scraps.

01:03.136 --> 01:06.639
Perhaps my long slumber
caused me to forget

01:06.640 --> 01:08.741
the devious nature of humans,

01:08.742 --> 01:11.777
because if you are anything,

01:11.778 --> 01:14.380
you are a human.

01:15.449 --> 01:17.183
(gasping)

01:22.155 --> 01:23.495
(coughing)

01:25.459 --> 01:26.492
Your kind

01:26.493 --> 01:28.594
can never be trusted.

01:28.595 --> 01:30.262
My Lord...

01:31.765 --> 01:33.633
I did not betray you.

01:33.634 --> 01:35.001
Lies!

01:35.002 --> 01:36.135
You knew the Witnesses

01:36.136 --> 01:38.504
had the Emblem of Thura,

01:38.505 --> 01:40.306
yet you hid that from me.

01:40.307 --> 01:42.174
It nearly resulted

01:42.175 --> 01:43.943
in my downfall.

01:47.714 --> 01:51.484
I recognized the error of my ways.

01:51.485 --> 01:54.020
I enlisted the help of the Witness,

01:54.021 --> 01:57.824
to aid me in freeing you.

01:57.825 --> 02:01.727
The only reason you are still alive.

02:03.196 --> 02:05.197
Clean yourself up.

02:05.198 --> 02:07.500
I may continue your punishment later,

02:07.501 --> 02:10.369
but for now...

02:10.370 --> 02:11.904
I am weary.

02:25.185 --> 02:26.552
You really don't miss coffee?

02:26.553 --> 02:27.720
Not really.

02:27.721 --> 02:28.888
I think being stranded

02:28.889 --> 02:30.590
in an unearthly realm for a year

02:30.591 --> 02:32.358
helps you kick those addictions.

02:32.359 --> 02:33.826
Hmm.

02:33.827 --> 02:35.261
Maybe I should go to the Catacombs.

02:35.262 --> 02:37.396
My diet soda habit's out of control.

02:37.397 --> 02:38.898
(knocking)

02:38.899 --> 02:41.000
I swear...

02:41.001 --> 02:43.269
I'm gonna tie the key to Crane's neck.

02:43.270 --> 02:44.370
Yeah.

02:44.371 --> 02:46.038
(clears throat)

02:46.039 --> 02:48.941
Abigail.

02:48.942 --> 02:50.610
Hope I'm not interrupting.

02:50.611 --> 02:51.944
No.

02:51.945 --> 02:53.379
Come in.

02:55.782 --> 02:57.250
Oh, Jennifer.

02:57.251 --> 02:58.518
I'm glad you're here, too.

02:58.519 --> 02:59.952
What are you doing here?

02:59.953 --> 03:01.621
Oh, well, I was, uh,
passing through town

03:01.622 --> 03:04.423
for work, and, uh,
your place is on the way,

03:04.424 --> 03:05.791
and I found something that

03:05.792 --> 03:07.393
maybe I-I thought you
might want to, um...

03:07.394 --> 03:10.296
Look, the truth is,

03:10.297 --> 03:12.765
I just wanted to say hi.

03:12.766 --> 03:14.233
After I saw you at the diner,

03:14.234 --> 03:16.802
I, uh, dug through some old boxes.

03:16.803 --> 03:18.538
I don't have a lot of
stuff from the old days,

03:18.539 --> 03:21.707
but I did find this.

03:21.708 --> 03:23.142
I thought you might want to know more

03:23.143 --> 03:24.310
about who you are,

03:24.311 --> 03:26.712
where you came from.

03:29.550 --> 03:32.118
This was the first picture
we ever took of you.

03:32.119 --> 03:33.586
You tried to walk for months.

03:33.587 --> 03:36.289
Kept at it from morning to night.

03:36.290 --> 03:37.957
I-I remember this one.

03:37.958 --> 03:39.926
You used to bring home taffy

03:39.927 --> 03:41.727
when you were out of town for work.

03:41.728 --> 03:43.462
Yeah, from that place in Atlantic City.

03:43.463 --> 03:44.497
What was it called?

03:44.498 --> 03:46.299
A real funny name...

03:46.300 --> 03:48.134
You remember this, don't you?

03:48.135 --> 03:50.603
- You got it in your hair; Mom
had to cut it out. - Yeah.

03:50.604 --> 03:53.572
Sorry, no.

03:56.476 --> 03:58.477
Ah, your mother.

03:58.478 --> 04:00.179
She was an amazing woman.

04:00.180 --> 04:01.747
Beautiful.

04:01.748 --> 04:03.149
Strong.

04:03.150 --> 04:04.850
And you left her.

04:08.121 --> 04:09.322
There were a lot of things

04:09.323 --> 04:12.191
that were unspoken between us.

04:12.192 --> 04:14.460
Too many secrets.

04:14.461 --> 04:17.029
A relationship can survive
most anything...

04:17.029 --> 04:18.264
except secrets.

04:18.265 --> 04:20.099
(door opens)

04:20.100 --> 04:23.503
Here endeth the reign
of the house of burger.

04:23.504 --> 04:26.339
Long live the new fast food king,

04:26.340 --> 04:30.142
a poultry farm in Kentucky
and Colonel... oh.

04:31.545 --> 04:33.479
Oh, we have company. Crane...

04:33.480 --> 04:35.882
uh, this is...

04:35.883 --> 04:37.316
(chuckles)

04:37.317 --> 04:38.618
This is Ezra Mills.

04:42.489 --> 04:45.725
My name is Ichabod Crane.

04:45.726 --> 04:48.194
What a pleasure to
make your acquaintance.

04:48.195 --> 04:49.862
The pleasure's mine.

04:49.863 --> 04:51.864
ABBIE: Ezra was just

04:51.865 --> 04:53.866
passing through on his way to...

04:53.867 --> 04:55.401
EZRA: Uh, Maryland.

04:55.402 --> 04:56.903
- ...Maryland for business.
- Yeah, um,

04:56.904 --> 04:58.971
I should be going.

04:58.972 --> 05:01.674
Um, it was nice seeing
you again, girls,

05:01.675 --> 05:03.209
and it's nice meeting you, Crane.

05:03.210 --> 05:04.710
Likewise.

05:04.711 --> 05:06.278
Take good care of my daughter.

05:20.994 --> 05:22.662
(door closes)

05:22.663 --> 05:25.231
I appear to have missed something.

05:25.232 --> 05:27.200
No.

05:27.201 --> 05:29.335
You didn't miss anything.

05:45.419 --> 05:48.020
(clattering)

05:59.032 --> 06:00.266
(gun clicks)

06:00.267 --> 06:02.468
Pandora.

06:02.469 --> 06:05.204
The other Witness, where is she?

06:05.205 --> 06:07.807
Why would I divulge that to you?

06:07.808 --> 06:09.775
She has heard my story.

06:09.776 --> 06:12.044
I have confessed to her my shame.

06:12.045 --> 06:13.780
She will know that I speak the truth.

06:13.781 --> 06:17.617
Well, then how unfortunate
that I am the only Witness here.

06:17.618 --> 06:19.552
Please...

06:19.553 --> 06:23.589
do not let our past distract you.

06:23.590 --> 06:26.592
I am the only one who can
bring salvation to...

06:26.593 --> 06:28.761
Stop talking. (sighs)

06:28.762 --> 06:30.229
Judging by your appearance,

06:30.230 --> 06:32.431
this will actually hurt this time.

06:32.432 --> 06:34.133
So, tell me,

06:34.134 --> 06:36.068
why are you here?

06:36.069 --> 06:37.870
I need the rest of the Box.

06:39.907 --> 06:42.074
It was forged by the gods themselves

06:42.075 --> 06:44.310
to contain their power.

06:44.311 --> 06:46.612
It is the only thing
that will stop him.

06:46.613 --> 06:48.514
The Hidden One?

06:50.184 --> 06:52.652
Why would we believe that?

06:52.653 --> 06:54.454
Because if you do not,

06:54.455 --> 06:56.622
then we will all be extinguished.

06:56.623 --> 07:01.093
So, your impending demise
caused a change of heart.

07:01.094 --> 07:03.763
I speak the truth.

07:03.764 --> 07:05.798
If I were to believe you,

07:05.799 --> 07:08.434
there must be another way to stop him.

07:08.435 --> 07:10.803
Another way to restore the Box.

07:10.804 --> 07:12.839
It cannot be repaired,

07:12.840 --> 07:15.174
but it can be regenerated,

07:15.175 --> 07:18.010
only in the place where it was forged.

07:18.011 --> 07:19.512
The Catacombs.

07:19.513 --> 07:21.714
And it is impossible to journey there,

07:21.715 --> 07:24.283
now that you and your
partners have killed

07:24.284 --> 07:25.952
the Tree of Fear.

07:25.953 --> 07:28.955
Impossible for most, perhaps.

07:28.956 --> 07:30.323
This cutlass.

07:30.324 --> 07:32.291
This belonged to Betsy Ross.

07:32.292 --> 07:34.994
So, if we could find a path...

07:34.995 --> 07:36.996
Then there would be hope.

07:55.315 --> 07:56.883
Your mile's even faster

07:56.884 --> 07:58.217
than Quantico.

07:58.218 --> 07:59.752
Just trying to keep
pace with your time.

07:59.753 --> 08:02.021
Oh, well, then you
have a long way to go.

08:02.022 --> 08:03.423
Oh, it's like that now.

08:03.424 --> 08:04.857
(chuckles) You care to put

08:04.858 --> 08:06.838
your money where your sneakers are?

08:07.761 --> 08:09.729
Danny,

08:09.730 --> 08:11.230
um,

08:11.231 --> 08:12.999
I don't really know
where to start with this,

08:13.000 --> 08:16.169
but I have some things
that I have to tell you,

08:16.170 --> 08:18.705
and I don't know if this
is the right place,

08:18.706 --> 08:20.273
or if there will ever
be a right place...

08:20.274 --> 08:21.274
(phone chimes)

08:21.275 --> 08:23.209
...but...

08:24.211 --> 08:26.946
But there is a right time.

08:26.947 --> 08:29.415
I have to...

08:29.416 --> 08:30.717
You got to go.

08:30.718 --> 08:33.086
You can't tell me where.

08:33.087 --> 08:34.354
You'll explain later.

08:34.355 --> 08:36.155
We'll talk when you're ready.

08:41.061 --> 08:43.663
(sighs)

08:45.099 --> 08:47.233
Hey, what's the emergency?

08:47.234 --> 08:48.534
We had a visitor...

08:48.535 --> 08:51.304
and she had some rather alarming news.

08:51.305 --> 08:52.772
She?

08:52.773 --> 08:53.873
Pandora.

08:53.874 --> 08:55.108
I found her in the Masonic Cell,

08:55.109 --> 08:56.609
searching for pieces of her Box.

08:56.610 --> 08:58.077
She told me that the Hidden One

08:58.078 --> 08:59.412
is approaching full power,

08:59.413 --> 09:01.080
and we have but 48 hours

09:01.081 --> 09:03.149
before he destroys all of humanity.

09:03.150 --> 09:04.784
And she needs her Box to stop him.

09:04.785 --> 09:05.785
Yes.

09:05.786 --> 09:08.655
But...

09:08.656 --> 09:10.957
the Box can only be regenerated

09:10.958 --> 09:12.925
in the Catacombs.

09:15.929 --> 09:17.463
You want to go to the Catacombs?

09:17.464 --> 09:19.098
It appears it is our only option.

09:19.099 --> 09:20.833
If you believe Pandora.

09:20.834 --> 09:22.802
Lieutenant, you once
allied yourself with her.

09:22.803 --> 09:24.103
To save you.

09:24.104 --> 09:26.072
Now this is to save all of us.

09:26.073 --> 09:28.174
(sighs)

09:29.910 --> 09:32.445
This must be your decision.

09:34.448 --> 09:36.349
I know what that place did to you.

09:36.350 --> 09:42.221
I know how hard it has
been for you to recover.

09:44.525 --> 09:48.261
I will not proceed unless
you are fully on board.

09:49.997 --> 09:52.365
There's no way of going
back to the Catacombs.

09:52.366 --> 09:54.500
Not that we know of...

09:54.501 --> 09:56.669
but we do know that Paul Revere

09:56.670 --> 09:58.723
recovered the Eye of
Providence for Washington,

09:58.724 --> 09:59.872
and according to Pandora,

09:59.873 --> 10:01.774
the Eye was previously
in the Catacombs.

10:01.775 --> 10:04.978
We also know that Betsy Ross,
at some point, was there,

10:04.979 --> 10:06.512
and she discerned a way out.

10:06.513 --> 10:09.115
Now, the last time I saw
Revere and Betsy together

10:09.116 --> 10:12.552
was Christmas Day, 1776...

10:12.553 --> 10:14.120
with Washington's forces

10:14.121 --> 10:15.521
as they prepared to launch

10:15.522 --> 10:17.622
an attack on the
Hessians in New Jersey.

10:18.826 --> 10:19.892
The crossing of the Delaware.

10:19.893 --> 10:21.127
You were a part of that mission?

10:21.128 --> 10:23.696
No.

10:23.697 --> 10:25.999
Washington ordered me to stay behind,

10:26.000 --> 10:28.534
a decision with which
I heartily disagreed.

10:28.535 --> 10:30.537
So, there I was,

10:30.538 --> 10:33.239
stood on the riverbank
watching the launch.

10:35.676 --> 10:37.644
The fog was so thick,
I lost sight of them

10:37.645 --> 10:39.078
as soon as they left the shore.

10:40.381 --> 10:43.716
The fog, as in a mystical fog?

10:43.717 --> 10:45.985
Possibly.

10:45.986 --> 10:48.721
What if Washington
asked you to stay back

10:48.722 --> 10:50.690
because they weren't
going to New Jersey?

10:50.691 --> 10:53.359
What if the crossing at the
Delaware was actually...

10:53.360 --> 10:55.995
a journey to the Catacombs.

ABBIE: <i>So, the original painting
was created by Emanuel Leutze,</i>

11:34.505 --> 11:37.641
who painted it 80 years
after the actual crossing.

11:37.642 --> 11:39.609
It was based on an
eyewitness account in a journal

11:39.610 --> 11:40.810
of General John Sullivan.

11:40.811 --> 11:42.412
And Sullivan

11:42.413 --> 11:43.980
was a Mason.

11:43.981 --> 11:46.706
Any relevant details needed

11:46.707 --> 11:48.674
to be transmitted
to future generations,

11:48.675 --> 11:51.477
he would surely have made note.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.947
God's wounds.

11:56.850 --> 11:59.318
How have I not seen this before?

11:59.319 --> 12:02.055
This man with the flag...

12:02.056 --> 12:03.856
he has a rabbit fur hat.

12:03.857 --> 12:07.360
Four inch brim at the front,
five inch fan...

12:07.361 --> 12:11.197
a prominent cockade.

12:15.703 --> 12:16.936
This was Betsy Ross's

12:16.937 --> 12:18.938
cocked hat.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.773
So, that's...

12:20.774 --> 12:23.009
supposed to be Betsy in the painting?

12:23.010 --> 12:25.211
Leutze must have assumed

12:25.212 --> 12:27.013
that the figures Sullivan described

12:27.014 --> 12:29.594
were all male, but this...

12:30.718 --> 12:32.418
Betsy was on that boat.

12:32.419 --> 12:33.953
Wait, are you sure?
I mean, you're placing

12:33.954 --> 12:35.455
- a lot of weight on a hat.
- No, no, no,

12:35.456 --> 12:36.956
I'm quite certain.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.424
I recall

12:38.425 --> 12:40.126
that day very clearly.

12:40.127 --> 12:42.495
(soldiers shouting)

12:44.264 --> 12:45.298
Washington is leading

12:45.299 --> 12:46.899
a company of his very best men

12:46.900 --> 12:49.235
across the Delaware to take
the Hessians by surprise.

12:49.236 --> 12:51.270
It's a bold move.
It's a brilliant move.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.373
Possibly the turning point of the war,

12:53.374 --> 12:56.042
but what's my role in this?

12:56.043 --> 12:59.746
I'm being forced to stay
behind and play nursemaid.

12:59.747 --> 13:02.982
See it from his perspective, Crane.

13:02.983 --> 13:06.452
You're too valuable to risk
on such a dangerous journey.

13:06.453 --> 13:09.122
Valuable?

13:09.123 --> 13:11.657
Of what value am I in inaction?

13:11.658 --> 13:13.292
Washington didn't invite you

13:13.293 --> 13:14.593
on his mission either, did he?

13:16.296 --> 13:18.231
No.

13:18.232 --> 13:21.300
All he asked was that I complete this.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.069
What do you think?

13:24.938 --> 13:26.939
Let's see.

13:26.940 --> 13:30.243
Oh, Betsy, that's beautiful.

13:30.244 --> 13:32.345
These five-pointed stars,

13:32.346 --> 13:34.414
that's an improvement on the original.

13:34.415 --> 13:36.115
Look at them.

13:37.751 --> 13:39.952
They practically shimmer.

13:39.953 --> 13:42.422
(chuckles) An illusion,

13:42.423 --> 13:45.091
created with a little gold thread.

13:45.092 --> 13:47.193
It's clever.

13:47.194 --> 13:49.629
I daresay, if all goes well today,

13:49.630 --> 13:52.365
this may very well be
how I'm remembered.

13:53.801 --> 13:55.268
After all the missions,

13:55.269 --> 13:59.172
this flag may be my
greatest accomplishment.

13:59.173 --> 14:01.407
Betsy, I'm certain you are wrong there.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.647
And even if it were...

14:10.718 --> 14:13.085
...it really is beautiful.

14:14.955 --> 14:18.024
Wow, the Betsy Ross flag.

14:18.025 --> 14:19.459
The original Stars and Stripes.

14:19.460 --> 14:20.660
She told me

14:20.661 --> 14:23.329
she was not going on the mission.

14:23.330 --> 14:24.864
Clearly, she did.

14:24.865 --> 14:26.399
Well, she knew you'd just worry.

14:26.400 --> 14:27.967
She must have cared about you a lot.

14:27.968 --> 14:30.903
Indeed.

14:30.904 --> 14:33.139
You said she used golden thread.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.874
Yes, it was a decorative flourish.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.509
I always thought it rather baroque

14:36.510 --> 14:39.078
for Betsy's tastes.

14:39.079 --> 14:41.180
You used this

14:41.181 --> 14:43.182
to find me when I was
in the Catacombs, right?

14:43.183 --> 14:45.518
The Lydian Jug.

14:45.519 --> 14:48.721
Orpheus employed it to locate
Eurydice in the Underworld,

14:48.722 --> 14:51.924
but it did not work
quite so well for me.

14:51.925 --> 14:52.992
No, but you were on the right track.

14:52.993 --> 14:54.160
I followed up on some

14:54.161 --> 14:55.561
of your Orpheus research,

14:55.562 --> 14:57.063
and the Jug helped him find Eurydice,

14:57.064 --> 14:59.665
but to enter the
Underworld he used a lyre,

14:59.666 --> 15:02.368
one strung with golden thread.

15:02.369 --> 15:04.237
Betsy always said that the flag

15:04.238 --> 15:05.438
was her greatest achievement,

15:05.439 --> 15:08.608
but the flag is not important.

15:08.609 --> 15:10.743
It is the thread she sewed into it.

15:10.744 --> 15:13.413
Somehow it allowed them
to enter the Catacombs.

15:13.414 --> 15:15.081
So, we need Betsy Ross's flag.

15:15.082 --> 15:17.350
Right, uh... last time

15:17.351 --> 15:19.185
I saw the flag, it was with

15:19.186 --> 15:20.286
Paul Revere.

15:20.287 --> 15:21.287
Now, Revere would have ensured

15:21.288 --> 15:22.355
that anything so vital

15:22.356 --> 15:24.123
was well-protected.

15:24.124 --> 15:26.359
He would not have allowed
it out of his possession.

15:26.360 --> 15:27.927
So, we need to figure out

15:27.928 --> 15:29.462
where Revere's stuff ended up.

15:29.463 --> 15:30.797
The Paul Revere House.

15:30.798 --> 15:32.365
North End, Boston.

15:32.366 --> 15:33.633
It's a registered historical landmark.

15:33.634 --> 15:35.268
Contains a full catalog
of his holdings.

15:35.269 --> 15:36.302
What?

15:36.303 --> 15:38.104
We went there on a field trip

15:38.105 --> 15:40.440
in sixth grade, Mrs. Broka's class.

15:40.441 --> 15:41.808
Is there a flag in Revere House?

15:41.809 --> 15:43.242
Yeah.

15:43.243 --> 15:44.710
The museum inventory logs one

15:44.711 --> 15:46.312
Revolutionary-era flag.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.548
(snaps) Okay, so...

15:48.549 --> 15:50.049
we can be in Boston
in a couple of hours,

15:50.050 --> 15:51.451
if you guys can figure out

15:51.452 --> 15:53.552
what we do with the
flag once we get it.

15:56.757 --> 15:58.925
MAN: <i>Well, this is quite a surprise,</i>

15:58.926 --> 16:00.393
uh, but the Historical Society

16:00.394 --> 16:02.462
is always happy to assist, Agent Mills.

16:02.463 --> 16:04.297
The FBI appreciates your help.

16:04.298 --> 16:05.431
You'll find that most of the rooms

16:05.432 --> 16:07.233
are exactly as Revere left them,

16:07.234 --> 16:08.634
virtually untouched,

16:08.635 --> 16:10.303
and we've actually been getting

16:10.304 --> 16:11.604
more visitors these days.

16:11.605 --> 16:13.106
Mostly Hamilton fans

16:13.107 --> 16:14.974
hoping to recognize
stuff from the musical.

16:14.975 --> 16:16.309
(chuckles) Have you seen it?

16:16.310 --> 16:19.178
A musical about Alexander Hamilton?

16:19.179 --> 16:21.080
Unbelievable.

16:21.081 --> 16:22.915
The man had a voice like a stuck goat.

16:22.916 --> 16:24.784
Seriously, that's why

16:24.785 --> 16:26.486
he wrote so many pamphlets.
No one could bare to listen

16:26.487 --> 16:28.187
- to him speak.
- Would you mind if we

16:28.188 --> 16:29.689
- took a look around?
- Oh, not at all.

16:29.690 --> 16:30.690
Let me just make sure

16:30.691 --> 16:31.791
the exhibits have been cleared.

16:31.792 --> 16:33.092
Thank you.

16:35.763 --> 16:37.463
Stuck goat?

16:42.202 --> 16:44.771
Your father seemed...

16:44.772 --> 16:46.339
well.

16:46.340 --> 16:49.108
I guess.

16:49.109 --> 16:50.843
Perhaps now we might see

16:50.844 --> 16:55.515
a little more of him around the house.

16:55.516 --> 16:58.051
Go on, Crane.

16:58.052 --> 17:00.720
What do you want to ask?

17:00.721 --> 17:02.288
No, nothing.

17:02.289 --> 17:04.190
I merely want to express how

17:04.191 --> 17:05.391
pleased I am that you and Miss Jenny

17:05.392 --> 17:06.858
have reconciled with your father.

17:06.859 --> 17:07.894
Well, I don't know about reconciled,

17:07.895 --> 17:09.060
but we're making progress.

17:09.061 --> 17:11.364
Probably more so for me than Jenny.

17:11.365 --> 17:12.531
But...

17:12.532 --> 17:14.367
I'm also at a point in my life

17:14.367 --> 17:17.537
where I am a little
more open to change,

17:17.538 --> 17:19.839
which is why

17:19.839 --> 17:24.377
I think I'm going to
tell Danny the truth

17:24.377 --> 17:25.845
about the whole

17:25.846 --> 17:28.314
secret, monster-fighting.

17:29.383 --> 17:31.918
Are you sure?

17:31.919 --> 17:33.553
I think it's time that he knew.

17:33.554 --> 17:35.822
If I want to have any
chance at something

17:35.823 --> 17:38.457
more with him, I have to be honest.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.560
All clear.

17:40.561 --> 17:41.594
The house is yours.

17:41.595 --> 17:43.563
Thank you.

17:43.564 --> 17:45.031
Thank you.

17:45.032 --> 17:47.300
Here.

17:55.676 --> 17:59.011
Oh, this is in a sorry
state of disrepair.

17:59.012 --> 18:03.549
I guess the Founding
Fathers did not believe

18:03.550 --> 18:05.885
in mothballs.

18:05.886 --> 18:08.621
This was not made by Betsy's hand.

18:08.622 --> 18:09.622
What?

18:09.623 --> 18:10.923
Are you sure?

18:10.924 --> 18:12.024
Yes, Betsy always used

18:12.025 --> 18:13.526
a modified whipstitch

18:13.527 --> 18:14.961
to protect the edges of her garments.

18:14.962 --> 18:16.896
This is a cross-stitch.

18:16.897 --> 18:18.798
Someone has taken Betsy's original flag

18:18.799 --> 18:21.400
and left this counterfeit in its place.

18:22.536 --> 18:24.270
(low rumbling)

18:24.271 --> 18:27.039
What was that?

18:30.778 --> 18:33.212
- (alarm beeping)
- Someone turned on the smithy,

18:33.213 --> 18:34.280
and I can't turn it off.

18:34.281 --> 18:35.748
I have to call the fire department.

18:35.749 --> 18:38.329
You folks need to get out of here.

18:39.953 --> 18:42.522
The smoke isn't coming from there.

18:45.793 --> 18:46.993
Oh.

18:46.994 --> 18:49.362
Whoa, these walls are scorching.

18:58.972 --> 19:00.239
(yells)

19:03.310 --> 19:06.012
(growls)

19:12.604 --> 19:13.871
(growling)

19:14.405 --> 19:16.706
(gun clicks)

19:16.707 --> 19:19.308
(gunshots)

19:22.479 --> 19:23.479
Crane!

19:28.485 --> 19:30.219
Crane! Come on.

19:39.630 --> 19:41.931
Crane.

19:48.105 --> 19:50.206
(growls)

19:54.945 --> 19:56.412
What was that thing?

19:56.413 --> 19:58.081
I recognized the
garments it was wearing.

19:58.082 --> 20:02.185
It was the uniform of the
8th Virginia Regiment.

20:02.186 --> 20:03.792
Now, most of the 8th
Regiment was killed

20:03.793 --> 20:04.854
during the Battle of Monmouth,

20:04.855 --> 20:07.290
but some defied orders and escaped.

20:07.291 --> 20:08.291
Now...

20:08.292 --> 20:09.292
there was an entry

20:09.293 --> 20:10.860
in Franklin's notebook.

20:10.861 --> 20:13.096
After Washington captured
one of the deserters,

20:13.097 --> 20:16.332
the Sisterhood of the Radiant
Heart tarred and bandaged

20:16.333 --> 20:19.536
the prisoner using infernal materials,

20:19.537 --> 20:21.504
thus transforming him

20:21.505 --> 20:25.041
into a creature known
as the Eternal Soldier.

20:25.042 --> 20:26.843
Revere must have assigned him

20:26.844 --> 20:29.312
to protect Betsy's flag,
and when we attempted

20:29.313 --> 20:32.181
to remove it, the Soldier was awoken.

20:32.182 --> 20:33.182
Except that wasn't

20:33.183 --> 20:34.284
the actual flag.

20:34.285 --> 20:35.718
At some point in history,

20:35.719 --> 20:37.620
someone replaced it with a fake.

20:37.621 --> 20:39.455
Someone who knew how
to get around the Soldier.

20:39.456 --> 20:41.858
Well, unlike said person,

20:41.859 --> 20:43.159
we have roused the beast,

20:43.160 --> 20:44.227
and in doing so,

20:44.228 --> 20:45.295
I fear we may have painted

20:45.296 --> 20:46.296
the proverbial target

20:46.297 --> 20:47.363
upon our backs.

20:47.364 --> 20:48.731
The creature will not rest

20:48.732 --> 20:50.567
until he hunts us down.

20:50.568 --> 20:52.468
So, not only do we need
to find the real flag,

20:52.469 --> 20:55.538
we need to do so without being
roasted by an overheated guard.

20:55.539 --> 20:56.739
Yes.

20:56.740 --> 20:59.642
And we're running out of time.

20:59.643 --> 21:01.911
(sighs)

21:01.912 --> 21:04.414
(sighs)

21:04.415 --> 21:07.984
Well, I can't find anything
in the Sumerian texts.

21:07.985 --> 21:09.385
Did you dig up anything else

21:09.386 --> 21:10.520
on the Orpheus legend?

21:20.564 --> 21:23.032
Downtown Brown's Taffy House?

21:23.033 --> 21:26.703
Okay, I know I'm not that
experienced with all this,

21:26.704 --> 21:28.838
but I don't think the
road to the Underworld

21:28.839 --> 21:30.907
runs through a candy shop.

21:30.908 --> 21:32.842
My dad used to get us
taffy from this place

21:32.843 --> 21:34.777
when we were kids.

21:34.778 --> 21:37.113
My favorite were the pink ones.

21:37.114 --> 21:39.616
Not that he'd remember.

21:39.617 --> 21:41.351
Come on, it sounds
like the guy's trying.

21:41.352 --> 21:43.932
I mean, that's got to count
for something, right?

21:44.355 --> 21:46.723
I guess.

21:46.724 --> 21:48.858
It was just so weird.

21:48.859 --> 21:50.126
Sitting around, pretending to be this,

21:50.127 --> 21:52.295
like, normal family.

21:52.296 --> 21:54.797
Looking at photos, laughing.

21:54.798 --> 21:56.466
Yeah.

21:56.467 --> 21:57.867
I mean, look, this whole thing

21:57.868 --> 22:00.270
is as new to him as it is to you.

22:00.271 --> 22:02.372
Yeah, you know why it's new to him?

22:02.373 --> 22:04.707
'Cause he abandoned us.

22:08.812 --> 22:11.247
I'm sorry, just...

22:11.248 --> 22:12.749
we're trying to save the world,

22:12.750 --> 22:14.551
and I'm here whining
about candy. (chuckles)

22:14.552 --> 22:15.552
It's okay.

22:15.553 --> 22:17.787
Abbie sent these.

22:17.788 --> 22:20.223
They were hoping that
whoever took the real flag

22:20.224 --> 22:21.591
would leave behind a clue,

22:21.592 --> 22:24.394
something that might
tell us where it went.

22:24.395 --> 22:26.162
What's with the holes?

22:26.163 --> 22:27.630
I don't know.

22:27.631 --> 22:28.665
Burn marks?

22:28.666 --> 22:29.732
Moths?

22:29.733 --> 22:32.268
No, they're too symmetrical.

22:32.269 --> 22:33.903
They're all identical.

22:33.904 --> 22:38.074
Hmm, meaning they were
put there deliberately.

22:38.075 --> 22:39.843
Maybe a grille cipher?

22:39.844 --> 22:42.746
Yeah, maybe, but, I mean,
what would the source text be?

22:42.747 --> 22:45.415
Why stripes?

22:45.416 --> 22:46.783
What?

22:46.784 --> 22:48.918
I mean, I get why the Founding Fathers

22:48.919 --> 22:49.986
put stars on the flag,

22:49.987 --> 22:51.321
and the-the red, white and blue,

22:51.322 --> 22:52.522
that's from the British flag, right?

22:52.523 --> 22:54.090
But why stripes?

23:05.669 --> 23:07.370
Music notes.

23:07.371 --> 23:08.945
You want to play <i> Name That Tune?</i>

23:08.946 --> 23:09.772
Yeah.

23:11.942 --> 23:13.343
All right.

23:13.344 --> 23:17.046
G-E-C-

23:17.047 --> 23:19.282
E-G-

23:19.283 --> 23:21.317
C.

23:23.054 --> 23:27.390
♪ Oh, say can you see... ♪

23:29.326 --> 23:31.227
(chuckles)

23:31.228 --> 23:34.130
Why is "The Star-Spangled
Banner" on this flag?

23:38.235 --> 23:39.702
JENNY: <i>Francis Scott Key</i>

23:39.703 --> 23:40.837
wrote "The Star-Spangled Banner"

23:40.838 --> 23:42.472
during the War of 1812,

23:42.473 --> 23:44.340
decades after the
crossing of the Delaware.

23:44.341 --> 23:46.142
Right, so there was no way that
he could have been involved

23:46.143 --> 23:48.178
with the journey to the
Catacombs, but here

23:48.179 --> 23:49.679
is the thing about Key.

23:52.083 --> 23:53.983
- He was a Mason.
- JENNY: That's right.

23:53.984 --> 23:55.552
Now during the war,
the British were invading

23:55.553 --> 23:57.687
the country and ransacking
artifacts everywhere.

23:57.688 --> 23:59.522
They hit the Capitol, the White House,

23:59.523 --> 24:01.491
and they were targeting
other important sites...

24:01.492 --> 24:02.826
Like Paul Revere's house.

24:02.827 --> 24:04.761
So, rather than risk Betsy's flag

24:04.762 --> 24:06.696
falling into the wrong hands...

24:06.697 --> 24:09.599
CRANE: <i>Key secured it elsewhere.</i>

24:15.339 --> 24:18.708
(explosions, soldiers shouting)

24:22.012 --> 24:23.580
JENNY: <i> Being a Mason,</i>

24:23.581 --> 24:25.048
<i>the story of the Eternal Soldier</i>

24:25.049 --> 24:26.549
<i>would have been passed down to him,</i>

24:26.550 --> 24:29.185
<i>so he knew how to avoid triggering it,</i>

24:29.186 --> 24:31.254
<i>but he left behind a clue</i>

24:31.255 --> 24:33.823
<i>as to where he put the real flag.</i>

24:37.261 --> 24:39.896
"Oh, say, can you see,

24:39.897 --> 24:41.464
by the dawn's early light..."

24:41.465 --> 24:43.266
Anapests. I cannot abide anapests.

24:43.267 --> 24:44.801
JOE: Crane.

24:47.705 --> 24:49.773
"Gave proof through the night

24:49.774 --> 24:52.208
"that our flag

24:52.209 --> 24:53.910
was still there."

24:53.911 --> 24:57.280
Key wrote those words at
Fort McHenry in Baltimore.

24:57.281 --> 24:58.481
Road trip?

24:58.482 --> 24:59.732
JENNY: We'll meet you there.

24:59.733 --> 25:01.751
I have some ideas on how to
deal with your tar monster,

25:01.752 --> 25:03.772
but I got to pick up some equipment.

25:10.962 --> 25:12.847
Without the protection
of the Masonic Cell,

25:12.848 --> 25:14.497
we must keep moving
or face detection by...

25:14.498 --> 25:15.799
Danny.

25:15.800 --> 25:17.300
- What are you doing here?
- I just got a call

25:17.301 --> 25:18.435
from an angry historian,

25:18.436 --> 25:19.903
saying one of my agents

25:19.904 --> 25:21.404
wrecked a national monument.

25:21.405 --> 25:22.405
I can explain that.

25:22.406 --> 25:23.640
What were you doing in Boston?

25:23.641 --> 25:24.674
And why does he have to be

25:24.675 --> 25:25.909
with you everywhere you go?

25:25.910 --> 25:27.444
- Agent Reynolds...
- I wasn't asking you.

25:27.445 --> 25:28.478
I was talking to her.

25:28.479 --> 25:29.395
I gave you space, Abs,

25:29.396 --> 25:30.788
and I think I've been
more than patient.

25:30.789 --> 25:32.315
- You have.
- But there are consequences...

25:32.316 --> 25:33.883
Danny!

25:40.424 --> 25:41.791
(growling)

25:56.841 --> 25:58.708
FBI!

25:58.709 --> 25:59.609
Freeze!

25:59.610 --> 26:00.544
Danny...

26:00.545 --> 26:02.145
I'm warning you, not another step.

26:02.146 --> 26:03.813
(gunshots)

26:06.884 --> 26:09.119
What the hell?

26:12.790 --> 26:13.790
Oh, God.

26:18.108 --> 26:19.441
(screams)

26:28.351 --> 26:29.718
(growling)

26:31.621 --> 26:33.355
(tires screeching)

26:35.292 --> 26:37.393
- CRANE: Get in!
- Come on, Danny, move.

26:38.528 --> 26:39.868
Inside.

26:42.232 --> 26:44.066
(tires squealing)

26:44.067 --> 26:45.467
(groans)

26:46.835 --> 26:48.508
That man... I unloaded a clip

26:48.509 --> 26:50.241
into his chest, and he kept coming.

26:50.242 --> 26:52.576
In his hands he created fire.

26:52.577 --> 26:56.280
Okay, that is because he is not a man.

26:56.281 --> 26:58.449
W-what are you saying?

26:58.450 --> 26:59.850
- He's a...
- A demon.

26:59.851 --> 27:01.085
A monster.

27:01.086 --> 27:03.287
Accursed spawn of hell.

27:03.288 --> 27:04.855
There are some things about this town,

27:04.856 --> 27:06.524
things that seem impossible,

27:06.525 --> 27:08.692
but monsters are real,

27:08.693 --> 27:11.161
and they're here in Sleepy Hollow.

27:13.298 --> 27:15.433
And you... fight these monsters?

27:15.434 --> 27:17.134
The two of you?

27:19.438 --> 27:22.873
So, that explains the
disappearing acts, the lies,

27:22.874 --> 27:24.241
the excuses, it was because of...

27:24.242 --> 27:25.776
o-o-of this.

27:25.777 --> 27:28.498
I wanted to tell you, really,

27:28.499 --> 27:29.914
and that's what I was
getting at this morning.

27:29.915 --> 27:31.482
I should have told you sooner,

27:31.483 --> 27:33.204
but I didn't want you
to find out like this.

27:33.205 --> 27:35.586
The thing is, it's only after us,

27:35.587 --> 27:37.955
so we're gonna drop you off
so you'll be safe.

27:37.956 --> 27:40.324
That doesn't sound good.

27:40.325 --> 27:41.592
It's okay.

27:41.593 --> 27:43.194
We have a plan.

27:48.734 --> 27:51.669
HIDDEN ONE: Pandora!

27:52.604 --> 27:54.772
Pandora,

27:54.773 --> 27:56.073
where are you?

27:58.410 --> 28:00.177
I am here.

28:00.178 --> 28:02.747
Why have you not

28:02.748 --> 28:06.250
brought me more sacrifices
to replenish the Hourglass?

28:06.251 --> 28:08.252
I am almost restored.

28:09.688 --> 28:12.857
I will no longer be providing for you.

28:12.858 --> 28:15.292
No longer

28:15.293 --> 28:17.962
will I feed your vanity,

28:17.963 --> 28:21.265
your hunger and your pride.

28:21.266 --> 28:23.300
How dare you?

28:24.636 --> 28:26.036
You forget your place.

28:26.037 --> 28:27.838
My place?

28:27.839 --> 28:30.674
I thought my place was by your side,

28:30.675 --> 28:31.976
as an equal,

28:31.977 --> 28:34.445
not as a slave.

28:34.446 --> 28:35.679
You were a slave once.

28:35.680 --> 28:37.515
And I rose up,

28:37.516 --> 28:40.017
and I helped you rise up.

28:40.018 --> 28:42.520
If there is one thing that I learned

28:42.521 --> 28:44.321
from those Witnesses,

28:44.322 --> 28:48.225
it is that the power of a true bond

28:48.226 --> 28:50.628
can conquer any might.

28:50.629 --> 28:54.865
They are stronger because
they have each other.

28:54.866 --> 28:57.902
They are stronger

28:57.903 --> 29:00.404
because they love each other.

29:02.741 --> 29:04.942
You?

29:07.813 --> 29:11.415
You love only this.

29:11.416 --> 29:13.584
The power.

29:21.259 --> 29:22.993
(chuckles)

29:22.994 --> 29:27.431
You are as foolish as you are cruel.

29:29.067 --> 29:30.735
(echoing): My astral form is

29:30.736 --> 29:32.169
what you mindlessly lash

29:32.170 --> 29:34.238
out against now.

29:34.239 --> 29:36.340
A trick I learned from you.

29:37.943 --> 29:41.912
I am now safely far away,
out of your reach.

29:41.913 --> 29:47.718
By sundown tomorrow,
I will be the one true God,

29:47.719 --> 29:50.788
and I will wipe away this world,
you included.

29:50.789 --> 29:55.092
Then you will see just
how far my reach extends.

29:55.093 --> 29:58.729
You love these humans so much.

29:58.730 --> 30:01.632
You wear their clothes.

30:01.633 --> 30:04.435
You feel their petty,

30:04.436 --> 30:06.771
worthless emotions.

30:06.772 --> 30:10.207
If you want to live among them,

30:10.208 --> 30:13.210
then you shall die among them.

30:38.896 --> 30:40.963
How long have you known?

30:42.066 --> 30:43.900
I was wondering

30:43.901 --> 30:47.503
how you and Mills
got so close so quickly.

30:55.179 --> 30:57.613
Not long.

30:57.614 --> 31:01.351
I got clued in when we
were hunting for Mills.

31:01.352 --> 31:03.753
I was...

31:03.754 --> 31:07.357
exposed to some weird stuff and...

31:07.358 --> 31:08.758
Crane got me up to speed.

31:08.759 --> 31:09.926
Why didn't you tell me?

31:09.927 --> 31:11.060
Tell you what?

31:11.061 --> 31:13.096
That... that Mills was trapped

31:13.097 --> 31:14.797
in a mystical dimension

31:14.798 --> 31:18.868
and we had to battle demons
from Hell to get her back?

31:18.869 --> 31:21.771
'Cause I'm not sure how
that would have looked

31:21.772 --> 31:24.040
on my quarterly evaluation, you know?

31:24.041 --> 31:25.241
Yeah, I'm not just your boss.

31:25.242 --> 31:27.443
I'm your friend.

31:27.444 --> 31:30.446
Yeah, you are,

31:30.447 --> 31:32.482
and as your friend,

31:32.483 --> 31:34.984
I wanted to protect you.

31:34.985 --> 31:38.388
This is not like-like telling someone

31:38.389 --> 31:39.589
that you've joined a private club

31:39.590 --> 31:41.758
with a secret handshake, okay?

31:41.759 --> 31:44.560
You get pulled into this world,
and there are consequences.

31:44.561 --> 31:47.730
Responsibilities.

31:47.731 --> 31:51.167
Once you know the truth,
there's no going back.

31:51.168 --> 31:53.369
Who else is in on this?

31:54.805 --> 31:56.506
Mills' sister,

31:56.507 --> 31:58.841
and her boyfriend, the EMT.

31:58.842 --> 32:00.510
Th-There's probably others, right?

32:00.511 --> 32:02.645
I mean, this is not
something that stays quiet.

32:02.646 --> 32:04.180
I don't know.

32:04.181 --> 32:05.682
That's the truth, man.

32:05.683 --> 32:08.284
I'm not that far ahead of you on this.

32:09.987 --> 32:11.287
(sighs)

32:11.288 --> 32:14.724
Welcome to the club.

32:19.496 --> 32:21.697
- Lieutenant?
- Hmm?

32:21.698 --> 32:23.700
You all right?

32:23.701 --> 32:25.101
Yeah.

32:25.102 --> 32:26.269
I mean, look,

32:26.270 --> 32:29.338
I hate the way that Danny found out.

32:29.339 --> 32:31.140
I should have told him before,

32:31.141 --> 32:32.542
so I could have controlled the message.

32:32.543 --> 32:34.343
Agent Reynolds is strong of spirit.

32:34.344 --> 32:36.980
He will be fine.

32:36.981 --> 32:39.849
And if there's one thing I've learned,

32:39.850 --> 32:43.119
it is that life rarely allows one

32:43.120 --> 32:45.955
the luxury of hewing to one's plans.

32:45.956 --> 32:48.524
The best we can do is

32:48.525 --> 32:50.359
adapt to those turns

32:50.360 --> 32:52.695
we never see coming.

32:52.696 --> 32:55.231
(indistinct chatter)

32:59.570 --> 33:00.803
Go and fetch Betsy Ross.

33:00.804 --> 33:01.904
Tell her we need her help.

33:01.905 --> 33:04.140
Miss Ross has left camp.

33:04.141 --> 33:05.141
When?

33:05.142 --> 33:06.876
I don't know, sir,

33:06.877 --> 33:09.297
but she said to give you this
after the boats returned.

33:16.386 --> 33:18.888
BETSY: <i>My dearest Crane,</i>

33:18.889 --> 33:20.423
<i>Why is it there is
always so much to say</i>

33:20.424 --> 33:22.558
<i>when there is so little time?</i>

33:22.559 --> 33:24.093
<i>You see, I am leaving,</i>

33:24.094 --> 33:26.329
<i>and I fear I will never see you again.</i>

33:26.330 --> 33:28.030
<i>Do not attempt to find me.</i>

33:28.031 --> 33:29.766
<i>Where I go, I go of my own accord,</i>

33:29.767 --> 33:32.735
<i>and I am at peace with
the future that awaits,</i>

33:32.736 --> 33:35.505
<i>but know that I curse myself
for not being strong enough</i>

33:35.506 --> 33:38.040
<i>to bid you farewell in person.</i>

33:38.041 --> 33:40.343
<i>For I have never been one
who can bear saying good-bye</i>

33:40.344 --> 33:42.211
<i>to someone I love.</i>

33:44.882 --> 33:47.016
<i>So be strong for both of us.</i>

33:47.017 --> 33:50.186
<i>As always, I shall count on that.</i>

33:50.187 --> 33:51.387
<i>With affection,</i>

33:51.388 --> 33:54.290
<i>Betsy Ross.</i>

33:58.929 --> 34:00.897
And she was right.

34:00.898 --> 34:03.065
I never saw her again.

34:03.066 --> 34:04.534
I'm sorry, Crane.

34:04.535 --> 34:07.570
But at least now you
know where she went.

34:07.571 --> 34:10.739
She traveled to the Catacombs
to get the Eye of Providence,

34:10.741 --> 34:12.909
and because she did,
Washington won the war.

34:12.909 --> 34:14.911
Yes.

34:14.911 --> 34:17.612
And 'twas best we parted when we did.

34:17.614 --> 34:19.549
She had her path to follow
after that mission,

34:19.550 --> 34:21.884
and I had mine, but my point is,

34:21.885 --> 34:26.621
Lieutenant, if you care for someone,

34:26.623 --> 34:29.759
do not leave anything unsaid.

34:29.760 --> 34:33.329
Crane, this is an American fort, right?

34:33.330 --> 34:35.231
- Used by an American army?
- Yes.

34:35.232 --> 34:38.501
Used continuously for over 125 years.

34:38.502 --> 34:42.071
But why is there a 42
foot statue of Orpheus

34:42.072 --> 34:43.371
on the grounds?

34:51.949 --> 34:53.248
CRANE: These, around the base.

34:53.250 --> 34:55.150
These figures are from Greek mythology.

34:55.152 --> 34:56.953
Hmm.

34:56.954 --> 34:58.821
No sign of Hades...

34:58.822 --> 34:59.822
Orpheus used

34:59.823 --> 35:02.558
a lyre to enter the Underworld.

35:08.932 --> 35:10.766
(bell chimes)

35:11.802 --> 35:13.102
Any requests?

35:13.103 --> 35:15.671
You know the tune.

35:15.672 --> 35:18.274
(bells playing
"The Star-Spangled Banner")

35:30.053 --> 35:32.553
(whispering): All right.

35:46.703 --> 35:50.239
(gears turning)

36:05.756 --> 36:07.623
(sighs)

36:29.746 --> 36:31.647
Still beautiful, Betsy.

36:38.021 --> 36:40.523
(growling)

36:56.490 --> 36:58.057
(growling)

37:05.166 --> 37:07.233
(yells)

37:15.309 --> 37:17.944
(bellowing)

37:25.921 --> 37:27.911
JENNY: Figured hot tar doesn't mix well

37:27.912 --> 37:29.146
with cold liquids.

37:29.147 --> 37:31.327
Can't get much colder
than liquid nitrogen.

37:51.870 --> 37:53.270
Science.

37:57.642 --> 38:00.043
You guys okay?

38:00.044 --> 38:03.447
A little singed, but no worse for wear.

38:03.448 --> 38:04.715
Did you get the flag?

38:06.951 --> 38:08.418
(chuckles)

38:16.227 --> 38:18.862
Long day?

38:18.863 --> 38:20.831
Guessing not as long as yours.

38:22.167 --> 38:24.535
What happened with the, uh,

38:24.536 --> 38:25.636
fire man?

38:25.637 --> 38:27.337
(chuckles) Extinguished.

38:27.338 --> 38:29.506
How often do you deal
with stuff like this?

38:29.507 --> 38:31.175
Seems like too often.

38:33.878 --> 38:36.180
So, listen, Danny, I know you have

38:36.181 --> 38:38.982
a lot of questions, and I am going to

38:38.983 --> 38:41.018
get to all of them... I promise...

38:41.019 --> 38:43.587
but first I need to say something.

38:45.223 --> 38:47.291
Thank you.

38:54.599 --> 38:56.667
(sighs)

38:56.668 --> 38:58.735
For the longest time,
I told myself that

38:58.736 --> 39:02.406
I couldn't let anything
happen between us because

39:02.407 --> 39:05.342
of this responsibility that
comes before anything else,

39:05.343 --> 39:07.177
but that was just an excuse.

39:07.178 --> 39:08.412
Uh,

39:08.413 --> 39:11.415
the funny thing is, I thought that

39:11.416 --> 39:12.683
once you knew the truth

39:12.684 --> 39:15.352
about the craziness of my world,

39:15.353 --> 39:17.120
that I would be relieved.

39:17.121 --> 39:19.823
I thought, I won't have to hide
anything from him anymore.

39:23.795 --> 39:27.364
But now you know and...

39:27.365 --> 39:29.800
I'm still scared,

39:29.801 --> 39:32.102
because it's no longer
about the monsters

39:32.103 --> 39:34.638
or the supernatural

39:34.639 --> 39:37.374
or anything else.

39:37.375 --> 39:38.876
It's just,

39:38.877 --> 39:41.278
it's just about, um,

39:41.279 --> 39:43.680
you and me.

39:44.783 --> 39:46.216
You and me.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.053
I thought I knew what that was,

39:50.054 --> 39:52.154
but now I really don't
know what's what.

39:56.561 --> 39:58.829
Crane.

39:58.830 --> 40:00.163
He's not normal, is he?

40:04.068 --> 40:05.335
Is he a ghost?

40:05.336 --> 40:07.070
Mm-mm.

40:07.071 --> 40:08.939
Huh.

40:08.940 --> 40:11.608
That would have explained a lot.

40:11.609 --> 40:13.677
(laughs)

40:15.246 --> 40:16.947
One more question.

40:18.817 --> 40:20.157
Can I kiss you?

40:40.872 --> 40:42.506
Hey.

40:42.507 --> 40:45.609
I never took you for a camper type.

40:45.610 --> 40:48.879
(chuckles) Yeah, I like to stay mobile

40:48.880 --> 40:50.647
and private.

40:50.648 --> 40:52.282
Oh, uh, I-I'm sorry.

40:52.283 --> 40:53.550
I didn't mean to intrude.

40:53.551 --> 40:55.552
I just came by to drop this off.

40:56.888 --> 40:58.856
What is this?

40:58.857 --> 41:01.625
Just my way of saying thanks.

41:01.626 --> 41:04.261
For what?

41:07.031 --> 41:08.765
For opening the door.

41:13.371 --> 41:15.172
(car door opens, engine starts)

41:15.173 --> 41:17.341
(door closes)

41:35.894 --> 41:37.828
(chuckles)

41:44.335 --> 41:46.703
(bells tolling)

41:46.704 --> 41:48.205
ABBIE: You want to tell
me why you called me

41:48.206 --> 41:50.741
to Law Memorial Park at sunrise?

41:50.742 --> 41:54.111
I was attempting to ascertain
how this flag might work.

41:54.112 --> 41:57.214
I tried everything:
lemon juice, perfume,

41:57.215 --> 42:00.184
all of Betsy's old spy craft tricks.

42:00.185 --> 42:02.186
No luck.

42:02.187 --> 42:03.921
It made me realize

42:03.922 --> 42:05.924
perhaps I didn't know Betsy
as well as I thought.

42:05.925 --> 42:07.091
Wait.

42:07.092 --> 42:09.860
Then it struck me.

42:09.861 --> 42:11.061
This flag is

42:11.062 --> 42:13.864
more than simply a piece of fabric.

42:13.865 --> 42:15.132
This is a symbol of the nation

42:15.133 --> 42:17.401
we fought to bring forth.

42:20.271 --> 42:22.639
It means something more.

42:22.640 --> 42:25.142
Just like the national anthem.

42:25.143 --> 42:26.944
It means something more.

42:26.945 --> 42:28.946
Okay.

42:28.947 --> 42:32.282
"Oh, say can you see, by..."

42:32.283 --> 42:35.385
"By the dawn's early light."

42:51.403 --> 42:52.636
It's the path Washington took

42:52.637 --> 42:54.271
to the Catacombs.

42:54.272 --> 42:56.607
Are you ready to go back, Lieutenant?

42:58.777 --> 43:00.728
Let's go.
