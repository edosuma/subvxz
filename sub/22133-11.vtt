05:19.920 --> 05:24.240
lieutenant Caine homicide are you in

councilman McKenna feels we need more

05:30.689 --> 05:32.759
professionalism of the force

05:32.759 --> 05:38.519
that's too bad he's a good man i'm
captain Sean and all

05:38.519 --> 05:43.169
captain Baywatch white patients deal way
we've got a cordon off the area

05:43.800 --> 05:48.449
ask your guards to keep everybody out I
don't want anybody touching anything

05:48.449 --> 05:51.300
until we finish our investigation they
know the drill

05:51.300 --> 05:55.439
any next of kin you know life is just
here

05:55.439 --> 05:57.910
she said she was going to the hospital

05:57.910 --> 06:00.910
I'll talk to her there all right I'm
gonna go make sure she knows where to go

06:27.680 --> 06:31.819
according to your account you were both
involved in rescues and prevention

06:31.819 --> 06:34.189
activities when the victim is found

06:34.189 --> 06:38.509
did you see anyone go near him in the
water less person song was his wife was

06:38.509 --> 06:40.879
on the beach is she going on

06:40.879 --> 06:44.689
no there's no warning no nothing nobody
saw him go under

06:44.689 --> 06:49.189
I don't get it as a perfectly healthy
man walk into the water and end up with

06:49.189 --> 06:50.660
a crushed windpipe

06:50.660 --> 06:54.919
anything could have hit him in that
crowd out there a surfboard a kayak

06:54.918 --> 06:57.859
he could have been pushed down to the
bottom by a wave and his neck on some

06:57.860 --> 06:58.729
rocks

06:58.728 --> 07:02.930
I don't buy it Lee look it was minimal
surf and the boards were way down the

07:02.930 --> 07:04.129
other end of the beach

07:04.129 --> 07:08.750
do you think someone did this on purpose
I had a victim once with ligature marks

07:08.750 --> 07:10.250
all around his neck

07:10.250 --> 07:13.430
murder no he got caught in his surfboard
leash

07:14.180 --> 07:19.668
sometimes people drown with no water in
their lungs their trachea locks off dry

07:19.668 --> 07:20.508
drowning

07:20.509 --> 07:23.300
he's right we can go jumping to
conclusions because the way the

07:23.300 --> 07:26.478
situation looks to get away for the
police to do their investigation

07:26.478 --> 07:30.288
find out what happened captain Monroe
this is sasha graves

07:31.069 --> 07:34.969

coroner's report there's nothing anyone

07:50.319 --> 07:51.219
could have done

07:51.220 --> 07:56.740

08:13.990 --> 08:18.129
huh what did they give an explanation of
how his windpipe crushed thing

08:18.819 --> 08:23.829
are you insinuating that someone might
have intentionally hurt anything mrs.

08:23.829 --> 08:28.120
Graves has answered enough questions
today if there's anything at all that we

08:28.120 --> 08:31.030
can do to help ease your grief please
let us know

08:31.029 --> 08:34.149
all i want to do is just take my husband

08:44.639 --> 08:47.549
when I want to make sure that she had a
ride to the hospital i found in the

08:47.549 --> 08:49.349
parking lot all over some guy

08:49.350 --> 08:54.810
so what so what her husband just died
she's making out with someone that

08:54.809 --> 08:57.838
people cheat on their spouses doesn't
make them killers

08:57.839 --> 09:04.949
ok please look all I'm saying is the guy
was wet like he just come out of the

09:04.948 --> 09:06.419
water right

09:06.419 --> 09:09.929
it's possible that is drowning wasn't an
accident

09:09.929 --> 09:15.778
look Monroe let's get one thing straight
this is a police matter now in our jobs

09:15.778 --> 09:18.419

suspicious about mr. graves death or his
widow will uncover it

was out snorkeling this morning and lost

11:20.210 --> 11:22.580
your favorite pair of Tahitian pearl
earrings

11:22.580 --> 11:25.580
Brian's down 50 feet to retrieve it

11:25.580 --> 11:32.028
I said 50 feet that's not that I'm and
Jason here can dive down a hundred easy

11:32.028 --> 11:35.720
in a hundred feet is impressive that
reason

11:37.230 --> 11:43.080
what you don't think I can do that you
can see that and then I'm gonna know you

11:43.080 --> 11:44.970

11:44.970 --> 11:53.070
oh hey man trying to make my boy look
bad in our bar that still so far my

11:53.070 --> 11:53.850
friend

11:53.850 --> 11:57.960
I've been coming here with way before
bolting you even learn how to swim - I

11:57.960 --> 12:00.960
twice smell a challenge

12:13.789 --> 12:14.809
graves

12:14.809 --> 12:15.919
yeah

12:15.919 --> 12:19.009
very sorry but I have to ask you to step
away

12:19.639 --> 12:23.629
I just wanted to put these flowers in
the water for Richard

12:23.629 --> 12:27.379
I understand that but this is a crime
scene and the beach is closed

12:28.190 --> 12:32.329
I have to ask you to step away up and I
don't understand

12:32.328 --> 12:35.328
the coroner's report stated that
Richard's death was an accident

12:36.110 --> 12:39.320
well that was just a preliminary report
we won't know for sure until he doesn't

12:39.320 --> 12:40.459
autopsy

12:40.458 --> 12:46.338
it could be mitigating circumstances
well that's crazy why would anyone want

12:46.339 --> 12:47.300
to hurt him

12:47.299 --> 12:50.419
did your husband have any enemies whoa

12:50.419 --> 12:53.569
everyone loved Richard what about your
friends

12:54.078 --> 12:57.229
any reason why anyone might not want him
around

12:57.230 --> 13:00.470
I suppose I should be used to this kind
of treatment by now

13:01.009 --> 13:06.198
when people don't like what they see
they usually make ugly assumptions

13:06.198 --> 13:09.259
actually you left very little to the
imagination

13:09.259 --> 13:15.379
the man you saw me with is a close
family friend Sergio was comforting me

13:15.379 --> 13:20.149
I need all my friends around me right
now to help me get over this terrible

13:20.149 --> 13:22.029
tragedy

13:22.029 --> 13:25.029
can you understand that captain Monroe

13:25.029 --> 13:28.809
yes I can but I also know someone heard
somebody that I loved

13:28.809 --> 13:31.809
I want to do everything in my power to
bring him to justice

13:35.179 --> 13:38.179
yeah

13:41.190 --> 13:42.570

14:32.000 --> 14:35.179

his action

14:35.179 --> 14:41.539

17:17.259 --> 17:20.980

17:24.328 --> 17:27.180
as its losing my husband is a painful
enough

now all of our dirty laundry is going to
be hung out for the whole world to speed

17:31.619 --> 17:35.369

22:18.919 --> 22:19.870
you know

22:19.869 --> 22:24.369
I was thinking about your husband you're
absolutely right it probably was an

22:24.369 --> 22:29.709
accident but what I can't figure out is
how a surfboard made that kind of a brew

22:29.710 --> 22:34.058
see I have this friend out of the
coroner's office it seems awfully

22:34.058 --> 22:38.558
convinced that kind of pressure more
could only be made by someone stopped to

22:38.558 --> 22:39.879
think about that

22:39.880 --> 22:45.940
you think I killed him don't you now why
would I do that for his money

22:45.940 --> 22:51.279

night to be should be the book

I came up with the cosmetics line I am
the wine

23:02.519 --> 23:06.579
who sold it door-to-door then I thought
of doing it on

23:06.579 --> 23:10.119
well my husband just laughed at me

23:10.119 --> 23:13.898
he didn't think a woman could be
successful using the internet

23:15.940 --> 23:21.038
he was dead wrong any other questions
you'd like answered

23:22.329 --> 23:24.579

23:27.730 --> 23:32.798
mrs. graves you have got one hell of a
mean streak in you think that's the

23:32.798 --> 23:37.058
first time a man's trying to get fresh
with me that what happened

23:37.058 --> 23:40.269
your husband hit you really want to know

23:40.269 --> 23:43.329
I do ya hear me

23:44.558 --> 23:49.089
with his favorite way to blow off steam
after a tough day lying around on the

23:49.089 --> 23:52.298
couch in front of the television while I
without making a living

23:53.710 --> 23:56.710
here's a piece of work

23:57.880 --> 24:02.710
that doesn't mean I have killed look
nobody is accusing you of anything

24:03.460 --> 24:07.600
you have to admit your behavior has been
a little strange have you ever been in a

24:07.599 --> 24:09.069
bad relationship

24:09.069 --> 24:13.269
have you ever felt like you were
drowning in the power of another person

24:13.269 --> 24:16.269
and you

24:18.019 --> 24:21.329
you seem like the type who's always in

24:21.329 --> 24:24.329
control

24:25.460 --> 24:30.048
look marriages go bad all the time
people leave

24:30.048 --> 24:33.379

do

24:33.380 --> 24:39.260

detective Kang catching criminals today

my job or use the tropics bar a couple

25:50.278 --> 25:56.429
hours ago I was it was doing my payroll
a law against that for you with Sasha

25:56.429 --> 25:57.359
graves

25:57.358 --> 26:04.710
she was there why are you harassing her
insist formal complaint

26:04.710 --> 26:08.999
she claims that us to meet you at the
bar and put the moves on her when she

26:08.999 --> 26:09.989
wouldn't sleep with you

26:09.989 --> 26:12.989
you're rough her up that's absurd

26:12.989 --> 26:17.129
she came to me she was drunk dress was
torn she was hysterical

26:17.909 --> 26:21.299
did you bother going down there asking
some people what they saw

26:21.298 --> 26:26.098
look Monroe I told you to stay out of
this now i got her pitbull lawyer

26:26.098 --> 26:27.720

26:27.720 --> 26:32.038
use your brain I'm a lifeguard I save
people don't hurt him

26:32.038 --> 26:35.788
it's your word against hers monroe and
she's got a hell of a lot of juice

26:35.788 --> 26:40.769
bien-être look I don't know how you did
things in the mainland

26:40.769 --> 26:43.859
around here we don't let people get away
with a crime just because they have a

26:43.859 --> 26:45.209
lot of money to throw

26:45.210 --> 26:49.289
well I don't know how you do things on
these islands but if someone gets in the

26:49.289 --> 26:52.289
way of my investigation I do something
about it

26:52.289 --> 26:56.339
now I'm warning you you go near her
again I'll slap you with a restraining

26:56.339 --> 26:59.159
order

26:59.160 --> 27:02.550
I can't believe this

27:02.549 --> 27:05.789
I'm gonna talk to Sasha their must-haves
now you stay away from early

27:05.789 --> 27:09.750
ladies a whack job there's no telling
what she's capable of one thing I don't

27:09.750 --> 27:13.470
understand then if it's her money why
would she kill her husband because if

27:13.470 --> 27:16.890
she divorced him it would cost her half
of everything she had it was cheaper to

27:16.890 --> 27:17.610
kill him

27:17.609 --> 27:22.769
besides probably was using as a punching
bag ok so what if you're right

27:22.769 --> 27:27.329
let the police go after her this
complaint she filed a serious stuff you

27:27.329 --> 27:28.470
keep pushing this

27:28.470 --> 27:32.640
you could lose the center everything
that you have worked for

27:33.569 --> 27:37.019
I'm gonna go talk to crazy Bob he's one
who pulled the husband out of water

27:37.019 --> 27:40.740

see anything less and glitters and as

27:40.740 --> 27:44.130
resale value besides he's gone he's gone

27:44.880 --> 27:49.410
I saw him leaving this morning the guys
worked to speech every day for 20 years

27:49.410 --> 27:53.460
