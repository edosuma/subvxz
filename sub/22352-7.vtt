WEBVTT

00:10.010 --> 00:13.513
[Dawn] So, now that I finished college,
I think this will be my last summer here.

00:14.097 --> 00:16.558
[Talvinder] If the Mayans are right,
it might be everybody's.

00:16.641 --> 00:18.309
[Dawn] God, I hope so.
I don't want to grow up.

00:18.893 --> 00:20.854
'Cause I want to be
a camp counselor forever.

00:22.397 --> 00:25.024
I don't know.
I think it'll be fun to grow up, you know?

00:25.608 --> 00:26.985
Finally have your own freedom.

00:27.068 --> 00:30.697
Right, because an unpaid internship
and a musty basement apartment is freedom.

00:30.780 --> 00:33.408
Like your parents would ever put you up
in a musty basement.

00:33.491 --> 00:35.910
[chuckles] I think we should
get a place together.

00:39.247 --> 00:40.373
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:42.625 --> 00:43.626
I'd love that.

00:43.710 --> 00:47.589
And if the world did end, we would have,
like,  the  party bunker. Am I right?

00:47.672 --> 00:48.923
[chuckles]

00:49.007 --> 00:53.386
Okay, confession. I was going
for, like, a sexy Katniss thing,

00:53.470 --> 00:57.140
but you look like Anne of Green Gables,
so I'm gonna need one more shot.

00:57.599 --> 00:58.767
-Okay?
-Yeah.

00:58.850 --> 01:01.019
[Dawn laughing] Okay.
Just shake out the hair.

01:01.770 --> 01:04.689
You're gonna have to teach me
how to do that later. [laughs]

01:04.773 --> 01:06.691
God, your hair's beautiful.

01:23.792 --> 01:24.709
[screams]

01:25.335 --> 01:30.882
[screaming]

01:38.807 --> 01:41.518
-[Peter] Renée!
-Mark!

01:46.731 --> 01:47.565
Look.

01:49.692 --> 01:55.156
[suspenseful music playing]

02:01.621 --> 02:06.751
-[grunting]
-[engine sputtering]

02:06.835 --> 02:08.044
[Peter muttering]

02:13.967 --> 02:15.135
[Peter] It's out of gas.

02:44.247 --> 02:45.248
Oh!

02:50.420 --> 02:52.881
-It's Renée.
-[Keira gasps] What about Mark?

02:55.633 --> 02:56.885
-Mark!
-Mark!

02:57.427 --> 03:00.096
-Mark!
-Mark!

03:02.015 --> 03:02.849
Mark!

03:05.852 --> 03:06.686
Mark.

03:09.981 --> 03:11.316
Oh, my God, you're bleeding. Okay.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.613
Hold this up to it.
It'll help with the pain.

03:17.655 --> 03:19.782
-Are you injured anywhere else?
-Uh...

03:19.866 --> 03:22.994
[inhales sharply] My side here,
where he slammed into me.

03:23.077 --> 03:23.912
[inhales sharply]

03:24.495 --> 03:26.789
[groaning]

03:26.873 --> 03:28.291
Now, he's got the gun!

03:28.374 --> 03:31.085
-[suspenseful music playing]
-[continues groaning]

03:34.797 --> 03:35.882
Where's Renée?

03:41.846 --> 03:44.807
Oh, God. Oh, Jesus Christ.

03:45.975 --> 03:47.810
What were you guys doing out here?

03:50.104 --> 03:50.939
I...

03:51.940 --> 03:53.816
Renée was looking for something in there.

03:54.984 --> 03:58.279
Proof or something.
I don't know. She wouldn't tell me!

04:00.573 --> 04:02.492
We need to get you back right now.

04:03.952 --> 04:04.786
No.

04:06.955 --> 04:09.874
We need to find out
whatever she was looking for.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.169
[Keira] I say it was Dawn.

04:14.545 --> 04:16.714
And I'm not just saying that
because she coldcocked me.

04:18.049 --> 04:18.925
[Peter] No.

04:20.176 --> 04:21.427
[Keira] "No"? Just "no"?

04:22.720 --> 04:25.640
Okay, let me ask you something.
Whose idea was it to come up here?

04:26.224 --> 04:27.517
All of ours, Keira.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.310
Well, somebody must
have suggested it first.

04:31.980 --> 04:34.315
-That's what I thought.
-Dawn?

04:35.024 --> 04:38.945
Organizing and carrying out
the execution of eight people?

04:39.028 --> 04:40.780
She can't even pick up
her own dry cleaning.

04:40.863 --> 04:43.616
I don't know. She seems pretty serious
about her self-defense, if you ask me.

04:49.497 --> 04:52.542
Okay, well, are any of the files missing?

04:52.625 --> 04:54.127
I don't know. There are dozens here.

04:55.795 --> 04:57.255
Are  your  files missing?

05:01.884 --> 05:03.511
-[sighs]
-Still don't think it could be Dawn?

05:10.268 --> 05:12.228
You should rest, Dawn. You're injured.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.855
Judith, someone out there wants me dead

05:13.938 --> 05:15.565
and has murdered
at least six people already,

05:15.648 --> 05:17.692
-so why don't you try and rest?
-Hey, Dawn.

05:24.282 --> 05:27.535
I know that was harsh.
I just can't take much more of this.

05:28.911 --> 05:34.625
Okay, we are headed to the archery range.
Yes, it's very, very exciting.

05:35.293 --> 05:36.669
Let's stay together. Don't wander off.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.713
That'd be a lot
of annoying paperwork for me.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.382
Hello! Guys! Let's go.

05:41.466 --> 05:44.969
-Okay. Hi! Hey.
-Hi.

05:45.053 --> 05:49.474
Hey, guys. Everybody, line up.
So, there's an old wise saying...

05:50.475 --> 05:52.018
in the ancient world of archery.

05:53.269 --> 05:57.065
You miss 100 percent of the shots...
that you don't take.

05:58.399 --> 06:02.403
So... don't be afraid
and trust your arrow.

06:04.989 --> 06:05.990
I'm not afraid, Dawn.

06:06.908 --> 06:10.828
Oh, okay. Why do I always get stuck
with the Jason Voorhees types?

06:12.371 --> 06:14.665
-You're a treat.
-You gonna try your luck today?

06:14.749 --> 06:16.375
-Me?
-Mm-hmm.

06:16.459 --> 06:18.711
-Sure, yeah.
-Great.

06:19.462 --> 06:21.047
We'll show these kids how it's done.

06:22.423 --> 06:24.133
-All right, scooch over a little.
-Scooch?

06:24.217 --> 06:28.179
Yes, scooch. All right,
we're gonna grab the bow in our left hand.

06:28.262 --> 06:31.432
So, you wanna be perpendicular
to your target.

06:31.516 --> 06:33.142
-Okay.
-So, straighten this arm out.

06:33.684 --> 06:34.811
There you go.

06:35.394 --> 06:38.773
-Okay.
-We're grab our arrow... like so.

06:39.273 --> 06:42.193
-We're gonna attach it to the bow string.
-I'm not very helpful.

06:42.276 --> 06:43.528
-I'm sorry. [giggling]
-No, it's okay.

06:43.611 --> 06:44.695
[both chuckle]

06:44.779 --> 06:46.322
Now, we're gonna take
these three fingers...

06:46.405 --> 06:47.907
-Okay.
-...and draw it back.

06:49.992 --> 06:51.119
And whenever you're ready...

06:51.202 --> 06:52.537
Okay.

06:53.996 --> 06:55.998
[laughter]

06:56.082 --> 06:59.127
Oh, my God. You are such a loser.

07:05.758 --> 07:08.886
Okay, yes, I have fired
more than one arrow in my lifetime.

07:08.970 --> 07:11.472
-You're a modern-day Robin Hood.
-[giggling]

07:11.556 --> 07:14.267
Oh, it's just I've taken
many private lessons growing up.

07:14.350 --> 07:17.603
Um, like fencing and archery
and horseback riding.

07:18.229 --> 07:20.273
-Usually somewhere in Europe.
-Wow.

07:20.356 --> 07:25.194
I'm sorry. That sounded douchey
and way cooler than it was. I...

07:26.112 --> 07:30.199
"Usually somewhere in Europe" is code for
"my parents were trying to get rid of me."

07:31.200 --> 07:32.952
Especially after they got divorced.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.124
You missed that first shot on purpose.

07:39.333 --> 07:40.168
Why?

07:42.753 --> 07:43.588
I don't know.

07:46.841 --> 07:48.634
Guys don't like it
when girls upstage them.

07:48.718 --> 07:50.219
[scoffs]

07:50.303 --> 07:51.304
They don't.

07:52.138 --> 07:54.223
I guess I just--
I've always thought like that,

07:54.307 --> 07:56.893
you know, that-that I have to act,
like, the right way.

07:57.810 --> 08:02.231
Dawn, I want you to be you...
when you're around.

08:03.316 --> 08:06.444
I don't want you to be someone else
or try to be something less.

08:07.695 --> 08:10.865
Seriously, just... be you.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.459
[indistinct chatter]

08:21.542 --> 08:26.839
Oh, shit, she's gonna be pissed.
Um, I have to go... [chuckles]

08:26.923 --> 08:28.966
But thank you for this.
It was, like, really...

08:29.550 --> 08:31.802
-It was very different.
-Different?

08:31.886 --> 08:35.097
It was a good different.
It was a good different. Um, I have to go.

08:35.681 --> 08:39.018
Maybe, uh, after it gets dark,
we can just-- we'll walk or something.

08:39.894 --> 08:40.853
I can't.

08:41.521 --> 08:44.398
Owen, you keep asking me out
and I keep saying no.

08:44.482 --> 08:46.984
No. No, you keep saying
that you have other plans, but--

08:47.068 --> 08:48.528
Which is the same thing.

08:50.029 --> 08:52.865
Please, this is really starting
to make me feel uncomfortable now.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.202
-Okay.
-And...

08:56.285 --> 08:59.705
my friend is actually
on her way over, so I'll...

08:59.789 --> 09:01.749
-Okay.
-I'll see you later.

09:01.832 --> 09:04.544
-Shit. Owen again?
-Yes.

09:04.627 --> 09:07.630
And if you were here on time,
you could have saved me from him.

09:07.713 --> 09:09.757
That freak asked me out again.

09:09.840 --> 09:11.467
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yes.

09:11.551 --> 09:14.136
If he keeps doing this,
we have to talk to Mr. Dubois.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.054
Well...

09:16.305 --> 09:17.765
In the meantime...

09:17.848 --> 09:21.435
Okay, I'm sorry I was late, but I just had
the most incredible moment with Ryan.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.814
So, you ditched me for a guy.

09:24.897 --> 09:27.275
Well, when you put it like that,
it sounds awful, but...

09:27.942 --> 09:29.902
if you were there,
you would totally have understood.

09:30.778 --> 09:32.947
Normally, I'd be trying to get with him,
like, yesterday.

09:33.531 --> 09:35.074
That's always been my MO, but...

09:36.826 --> 09:40.079
I don't know. It just never ends well,
and with him, it's different.

09:40.913 --> 09:45.418
It's just a summer fling. Why make it
more complicated than it needs to be?

09:45.501 --> 09:48.462
[Dawn chuckles]
It's always complicated, trust me.

09:51.048 --> 09:52.091
Speaking of...

09:53.718 --> 09:54.552
Here.

09:55.219 --> 09:58.639
An ex-boyfriend gave it to me.
It is bad juju. I don't want it.

09:58.723 --> 10:00.141
So, I get your bad juju?

10:00.224 --> 10:04.353
No! It'll look great on you,
and it cost him a fortune, so...

10:04.437 --> 10:08.232
-Oh. In that case, bring it on.
-[chuckles]

10:08.608 --> 10:09.609
Okay.

10:11.485 --> 10:14.071
-See, it looks gorgeous.
-Thank you.

10:14.155 --> 10:15.156
You're welcome, babe.

10:22.705 --> 10:24.498
You just-- You just sit right there, okay?

10:31.922 --> 10:32.757
You ready?

10:36.802 --> 10:37.637
[Keira] Okay.

10:59.575 --> 11:00.743
[Keira sighs] Where's the rest of her?

11:16.717 --> 11:17.718
I think it's Mark.

11:19.178 --> 11:20.179
That Mark?

11:21.722 --> 11:23.933
-No.
-He could be working with someone.

11:24.809 --> 11:27.853
Yeah, and that someone ran him over
with a snowmobile?

11:28.479 --> 11:29.980
And stole Dawn's gun? Why?

11:31.399 --> 11:33.234
It's a good cover story is all I'm saying.

13:22.384 --> 13:24.386
Hey, wait, you were the other woman?

13:25.095 --> 13:30.601
I'm not proud of it,
but, um, technically... yes.

13:31.185 --> 13:32.853
Okay, what was that like?

13:34.605 --> 13:36.649
You have to promise not to judge me.

13:38.484 --> 13:39.527
I promise.

13:41.820 --> 13:45.407
The home that I wrecked was mine.

13:48.077 --> 13:50.788
When I was 18, um...

13:52.665 --> 13:54.291
I seduced my stepfather.

13:58.337 --> 13:59.630
Dawn, I'm so sorry.

13:59.713 --> 14:03.717
No, no, it wasn't-- it wasn't like that.
It wasn't like that at all. He wasn't...

14:03.801 --> 14:06.804
He wasn't grooming me
or anything. Um...

14:09.848 --> 14:11.392
He and my mom...

14:13.269 --> 14:15.479
They'd been married
for, like, less than a year.

14:20.192 --> 14:23.571
I told her, I said...
that she had terrible taste in men.

14:25.114 --> 14:26.323
And I proved my point.

14:28.826 --> 14:31.537
I haven't had a relationship
that lasted more than six months.

14:34.206 --> 14:37.710
I don't wanna add to my body count,
and so, with Ryan...

14:39.253 --> 14:41.130
with Ryan, I wanna do it differently.

14:42.506 --> 14:45.259
I don't know how to do that. [chuckles]

14:47.678 --> 14:48.762
You know what you need?

14:50.973 --> 14:51.974
A wingwoman.

14:52.057 --> 14:54.768
[laughs]

14:57.187 --> 14:59.231
I don't know what I'd do without you.

15:00.357 --> 15:01.317
[chuckles]

15:01.400 --> 15:04.862
[footsteps approaching]

15:04.945 --> 15:06.113
[clears throat]

15:07.865 --> 15:08.908
Mark, how's your head?

15:11.076 --> 15:15.414
I've still got a headache, but, at least,
my double vision is crystal clear.

15:15.998 --> 15:19.752
You sure you should be drinking that?
You might have a concussion.

15:20.294 --> 15:24.423
Anything to dull the pain.
You want one? There's a couple extra.

15:24.506 --> 15:26.050
Sure, why not?

15:28.552 --> 15:30.304
-Anyone else?
-Sure.

15:30.387 --> 15:31.388
No, I'm good.

15:56.705 --> 15:57.539
Thank you.

16:01.001 --> 16:03.754
-Bottoms up.
-Thanks.

16:04.838 --> 16:09.927
Here's to alcohol not being
on the We Live As One no-fly list.

16:10.010 --> 16:10.844
[Wren whistles]

16:21.981 --> 16:26.026
Uh, why don't-- why don't we play
a drinking game? Never Have I Ever?

16:26.110 --> 16:27.319
I'm up for it.

16:28.404 --> 16:30.781
We used to play it all the time
when we worked here. Um...

16:31.490 --> 16:37.162
So... if you've done it, you drink.
So, um, like, if I said...

16:38.038 --> 16:42.126
"Never have I ever dated
a woman named Andi"...

16:43.460 --> 16:44.586
you would drink.

16:45.212 --> 16:46.547
Are we starting now?

16:47.673 --> 16:48.882
[Dawn] Yes, drink.

16:58.642 --> 17:02.813
Mm. My turn. Never have I ever...

17:05.566 --> 17:07.776
-put my finger in someone's asshole.
-[Keira] Ha-ha.

17:07.860 --> 17:10.821
I'm a nurse, so I've done that.
But I'm not playing.

17:10.904 --> 17:13.907
-Never done it.
-I can't say that I have.

17:15.200 --> 17:18.328
So... what if none of us have done it?

17:18.412 --> 17:20.914
Well, in that case,
the person who suggested it...

17:21.749 --> 17:24.126
uh, has to take two chugs
out of their bottle.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.049
That's one.

17:39.892 --> 17:43.896
Uh, never have I ever...
cheated on my partner.

17:54.948 --> 17:56.992
Uh, never-- Ever have I never...

18:00.746 --> 18:01.580
Wait.

18:08.003 --> 18:10.047
[inhales deeply] Mm.

18:13.967 --> 18:15.135
You're quiet.

18:16.386 --> 18:17.387
Everything all right?

18:20.474 --> 18:22.226
-Yeah.
-[chuckles]

18:23.310 --> 18:24.895
Everything's fine. [chuckles]

18:26.814 --> 18:27.940
I have some news.

18:29.358 --> 18:30.567
I'm moving in with Dawn.

18:31.902 --> 18:32.736
With Dawn?

18:32.820 --> 18:36.073
Yeah, once we finally get back
to civilization.

18:37.199 --> 18:40.369
Which means that you and me
should talk about us.

18:43.372 --> 18:44.957
Look, Peter, I've been patient.

18:45.040 --> 18:48.460
And I get it. That's cool. This is not
the time to bring up any drama, but...

18:49.044 --> 18:51.755
in a couple of weeks,
we'll be back to the real world,

18:51.839 --> 18:55.467
and I think that it's a good time
to talk to Andi.

18:56.885 --> 18:58.762
-I don't know.
-You don't?

18:59.721 --> 19:04.685
No, you said that you were gonna
break up with Andi. You said.

19:04.768 --> 19:06.770
-Yeah.
-Peter? Peter.

19:07.521 --> 19:10.315
Peter. Peter, look at me. I love you.

19:14.611 --> 19:18.615
It's just... Andi and I have a history.

19:20.534 --> 19:26.165
And... And I owe it to her
and to myself to...

19:27.166 --> 19:28.959
try and work things out.

19:29.042 --> 19:31.795
Look, I didn't want to hurt you.
That's the last thing I wanted to do.

19:31.879 --> 19:35.048
So, you're using me
to figure out your feelings for Andi?

19:35.132 --> 19:36.592
No, no, no, of course not.

19:36.675 --> 19:38.385
-That's--
-Were you gonna tell her about us?

19:38.468 --> 19:42.055
Or am I just some big dirty secret?
Is that-- Is that what this is?

19:45.100 --> 19:46.101
I'm gonna tell her.

19:46.643 --> 19:47.477
When?

19:48.312 --> 19:49.146
Eventually.

19:49.229 --> 19:50.606
-When?
-Eventually!

20:06.246 --> 20:09.208
[Dawn] And today, I'm having trouble
pitching my tent, right?

20:09.291 --> 20:11.126
And-- And Ryan steps in to help,

20:11.210 --> 20:13.921
except the thing is, he has no idea
how to pitch a tent either.

20:14.004 --> 20:16.423
So, we're, like-- we're both there,
we're trying to put together this tent.

20:16.506 --> 20:20.010
It is completely lopsided,
and all of the sudden, I am struck...

20:20.469 --> 20:23.180
with this vision of, like, the two of us
having our own place...

20:24.097 --> 20:26.558
like, assembling IKEA furniture together.

20:26.642 --> 20:28.810
I had no idea you guys were that serious.

20:29.895 --> 20:30.729
Okay.

20:33.190 --> 20:35.192
I think I can picture it with him.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.279
And, like, I've never pictured it
with anyone before.

20:40.030 --> 20:41.907
But we're still gonna
move in together, right?

20:42.574 --> 20:47.162
Yeah. Like, I'm obviously getting
way ahead of myself. [chuckles]

20:47.246 --> 20:48.538
Obviously.

20:49.289 --> 20:52.501
And if things progress with Ryan,
I can just, like, sublet my room.

20:57.214 --> 20:58.048
Um...

20:58.507 --> 21:02.261
Yeah. I'm so happy for you.

21:02.344 --> 21:03.679
[Dawn chuckles]

21:20.487 --> 21:21.571
[groans]

21:32.499 --> 21:33.583
What'd you do to me?

21:36.211 --> 21:37.671
What is he talking about?

21:38.255 --> 21:39.381
Answer me.

21:40.299 --> 21:45.470
He's the killer. Renée found evidence, hm?
Didn't she? Didn't she?!

21:45.554 --> 21:48.223
No! No, no, no! [stammering]
That's just my--

21:52.561 --> 21:54.521
-You poisoned me.
-No, it's just ketamine.

21:55.022 --> 21:57.357
We found it in Glenn's room.
You're gonna be fine.

21:57.607 --> 21:59.985
-You spiked my drink! You spiked my drink.
-How much did you give him?

22:00.068 --> 22:03.071
If you gave him too much, he can overdose.
Look at me, look at me, look at me.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.948
-Peter, you're gonna go lie down upstairs.
-No!

22:05.032 --> 22:06.450
-No! No!
-Peter, we can't take the chance.

22:06.533 --> 22:07.868
[Keira] Get your fuckin' hands off me!

22:10.412 --> 22:12.956
-[lock clicks]
-What are you doing?

22:19.713 --> 22:20.756
[grunts]

22:23.008 --> 22:25.719
Mark, he could die out there.

22:25.802 --> 22:29.389
Oh, now, you care?
You just poisoned your own friend!

22:29.473 --> 22:31.600
And now, he's out there
and he's gonna to die!

22:31.683 --> 22:33.143
-So, you better be fucking right!
-[Dawn] Okay.

22:33.226 --> 22:34.644
This was not supposed
to go down like this.

22:34.728 --> 22:37.606
We were supposed to tie him up
and control him. Mark.

22:37.689 --> 22:40.484
You go out that door,
we will not open it again!

22:40.567 --> 22:42.527
-Get your fucking--
-All right, listen.

22:42.611 --> 22:44.404
I know you've developed
feelings for Peter,

22:44.488 --> 22:46.031
but how well do you really know him?

22:46.114 --> 22:48.533
Where was he when the other people
were being murdered?

22:49.117 --> 22:51.745
-Why didn't he answer my questions?
-Because his friend was dying.

22:51.828 --> 22:53.747
No, Noah was not dead yet.

22:54.331 --> 22:55.749
Are you willing to bet your life

22:55.832 --> 22:57.793
on someone who's admitted
to covering up a murder?

22:59.753 --> 23:01.129
How well do you know Dawn?

23:02.172 --> 23:04.925
Did you know it was her idea
to come here in the first place?

23:06.134 --> 23:09.429
Is that why you brought the gun?
So you could get rid of the evidence?

23:12.891 --> 23:14.226
We're  the evidence.

23:17.521 --> 23:18.355
Mark.

23:27.572 --> 23:28.615
[Keira scoffs]

23:30.117 --> 23:31.118
[Judith] Keira, wait!

23:32.786 --> 23:33.870
I'll go talk to her.

23:40.001 --> 23:41.753
You think I'm heartless.

23:44.172 --> 23:47.008
Everything that has happened here
has been because of the decisions

23:47.092 --> 23:51.221
that you and Peter and your friends
all made on that day.

23:52.556 --> 23:53.723
What you need to do...

23:54.558 --> 23:58.562
is you need to take
a long, hard look in the mirror.

23:59.604 --> 24:01.106
You need to stop standing there

24:01.189 --> 24:03.608
and acting like this is something
that's happening  to  you.

24:05.777 --> 24:09.865
You need to take ownership for how
you closed your heart to that girl.

24:13.535 --> 24:16.163
Okay, so let him know I'm interested,

24:16.246 --> 24:18.999
but please don't make me look
like a desperate loser.

24:19.082 --> 24:22.878
-[Talvinder] Don't worry. I got your back.
-[Dawn] Thank you, T.

24:23.461 --> 24:26.006
Okay, thanks. [clears throat]

24:30.677 --> 24:33.263
Hey, Ryan, I'm taking drink orders
for the party tomorrow night.

24:33.930 --> 24:35.724
That fake ID came in pretty handy, huh?

24:36.892 --> 24:39.060
So, do you want beer, something harder?

24:39.686 --> 24:41.521
Do you want me
to grab something for Saudia?

24:43.231 --> 24:44.816
-Saudia?
-Yeah.

24:44.900 --> 24:48.195
-Everyone knows you two are a couple.
-Uh...

24:48.278 --> 24:51.823
[chuckles] No, I... Saudia's cool, but...

24:52.991 --> 24:54.367
we're just friends, and...

24:54.951 --> 24:56.536
Really, everyone thinks we're together?

24:56.620 --> 24:58.663
Don't worry, we won't tell Mr. Dubois.

24:58.747 --> 25:00.207
No, that's-- that's not it.

25:00.999 --> 25:02.459
Then what is it?

25:03.585 --> 25:04.794
[sighs]

25:05.378 --> 25:06.880
Dawn...

25:06.963 --> 25:10.258
-You know her better than anyone, right?
-She is my best friend, yes.

25:11.676 --> 25:14.763
Has she ever, I don't know,
talked about me?

25:16.806 --> 25:20.227
She thinks you're really good
with her kids.

25:22.938 --> 25:23.980
Oh, um...

25:25.565 --> 25:26.983
That's it?

25:27.567 --> 25:30.362
Sorry. Look, don't look so down.

25:30.445 --> 25:33.114
Maybe she just thinks
that you and Saudia are together.

25:34.741 --> 25:36.952
Yeah, yeah, maybe. Um...

25:38.286 --> 25:40.956
You think I should maybe
ask her out sometime?

25:44.042 --> 25:46.962
Eventually, yes, but...

25:48.964 --> 25:52.676
Between you and I, she has some hang-ups
when it comes to dating.

25:53.802 --> 25:56.179
If you want some advice, go slow.

25:58.139 --> 25:59.224
Pushing her could trigger her.

26:01.184 --> 26:02.185
What do you mean?

26:03.728 --> 26:04.562
Um...

26:06.856 --> 26:08.191
her stepfather...

26:10.402 --> 26:11.528
um...

26:13.571 --> 26:15.824
Oh... Oh, God, that's...

26:17.409 --> 26:18.535
that's terrible.

26:19.661 --> 26:21.037
Honestly, I shouldn't have said anything.

26:21.121 --> 26:24.082
No, no, you're just-- you're just
trying to be a good friend. God.

26:25.041 --> 26:27.961
Promise me you won't say anything to her.
She would kill me.

26:28.044 --> 26:29.629
Yeah, I-- I promise.

26:31.256 --> 26:33.883
Um, thank you... for the advice.

26:54.070 --> 26:54.988
[Wren clears his throat]

26:59.284 --> 27:00.118
Judith.

27:09.377 --> 27:10.211
Judith.

27:15.050 --> 27:17.344
-I feel dead.
-Don't say that.

27:21.097 --> 27:22.140
We're doomed.

27:25.643 --> 27:26.644
There's no point.

27:28.897 --> 27:30.023
There's no point.

27:43.453 --> 27:44.996
This is the point.

29:18.840 --> 29:20.175
-Hey.
-Hey.

29:25.221 --> 29:26.848
I really hate birds.

29:30.059 --> 29:31.811
[chuckles] Okay.

29:32.395 --> 29:35.356
I do. I don't-- I don't even understand
why people want them as pets.

29:35.440 --> 29:36.441
You know, it's like...

29:37.442 --> 29:39.527
They spread diseases.
They don't let you sleep in.

29:39.611 --> 29:42.197
They... shit on you
when you're not looking.

29:43.239 --> 29:44.824
-It's rude.
-It's rude.

29:47.577 --> 29:50.663
So... back when I was at camp...

29:51.498 --> 29:54.042
and not with these guys,
like, when I was a camper...

29:54.751 --> 29:55.585
I...

29:56.795 --> 29:58.755
was out for a hike, and I felt...

29:59.798 --> 30:01.299
like, a cushiony feeling under my foot?

30:03.760 --> 30:07.013
And I'd-I'd stepped on--
I think it was a sparrow.

30:07.096 --> 30:11.518
Like, one of those little brown birds
that hops around. Um...

30:13.394 --> 30:15.897
I guess it had hopped under my foot
and I stepped on it.

30:20.527 --> 30:23.696
And the thing is, um, that the force
didn't kill it instantly, you know?

30:23.780 --> 30:25.990
It was still alive,
so now it's up to me to decide

30:26.074 --> 30:28.368
if I'm gonna let it suffer and die slowly,

30:28.451 --> 30:31.913
and so I-I closed my eyes
and I stomped on it.

30:37.502 --> 30:39.963
The thing is,
I didn't really hate birds before then.

30:40.046 --> 30:41.714
I actually kinda liked them.

30:47.804 --> 30:49.180
I want you to know that...

30:50.807 --> 30:51.933
you're right.

30:54.185 --> 30:55.979
Everything that's happened is on us.

30:59.190 --> 31:00.942
And if I survive this, then...

31:05.780 --> 31:07.740
I'm gonna own up to what I did.

31:13.788 --> 31:19.043
[sobbing]

31:25.675 --> 31:28.011
[Dawn] Um, I'm gonna be back
in a little bit, okay?

31:28.094 --> 31:33.016
-Hey. Hey, how did it go last night?
-Uh... it went well.

31:34.309 --> 31:38.062
But  these  are some apartment listings
that I printed out for us,

31:38.146 --> 31:39.898
and these are the ones
that I've cross-referenced

31:39.981 --> 31:41.107
with the bed bug registry.

31:41.190 --> 31:43.568
Tal, come on. How did it go?

31:47.447 --> 31:50.950
He said... that you're not his type.

31:53.286 --> 31:54.412
What do you mean?

31:57.415 --> 31:59.584
He said he's not into curvy girls.

32:01.252 --> 32:06.049
He's into those, like, skeleton,
toothpicky types, you know?

32:06.925 --> 32:08.468
So, he thinks I'm fat.

32:09.385 --> 32:12.096
Of course not.
And you know that you're not.

32:12.180 --> 32:13.848
You deserve someone better.

32:15.683 --> 32:18.853
And in the meantime, you and I are
gonna have our own version of  Friends.

32:18.937 --> 32:22.065
It's cool. It's no big deal.
I'm gonna go, um, round up my campers.

32:22.899 --> 32:24.609
[Talvinder] Dawn, wait...

32:27.445 --> 32:29.697
[door opens, closes]

32:29.781 --> 32:33.701
[Talvinder] Chug, chug, chug, chug!
Go, go, go! You're on-- Whoo!

32:33.785 --> 32:37.246
-Dawn! Get it, girl!
-[laughter]

32:37.330 --> 32:38.581
[boy] Oh, man.

32:38.665 --> 32:41.459
[girls cheering]

32:41.542 --> 32:42.919
Thank you so much.

32:44.462 --> 32:47.298
Good evening. Oh, my God!
[laughing] I'm fine.

32:47.382 --> 32:49.050
Don't... Don't worry about me.

32:49.133 --> 32:51.594
I'm just wondering
what you're all talking about.

32:52.804 --> 32:53.680
Um...

32:54.222 --> 32:57.308
Archery, climbing,
you know, ropes and belaying.

32:57.392 --> 32:59.936
Belaying. [laughing]

33:00.019 --> 33:01.729
I know you'd love to get "be-laid."

33:03.314 --> 33:05.108
How about this pretty young thing?

33:05.191 --> 33:09.195
I bet she has real good grip strength,
right? [blowing raspberry]

33:09.278 --> 33:12.115
Look-- No, no, you don't have to get up.
I just wanted-- [muttering]

33:12.198 --> 33:15.201
Look, I just wanted to say that I--
I came to say I don't care.

33:16.202 --> 33:18.788
Can I say one more thing?
What is with the beanie?

33:18.871 --> 33:20.373
This, I don't know about.

33:20.957 --> 33:23.334
I just wanna know-- 'cause it's like--
are you hot, are you cold?

33:23.418 --> 33:24.711
Why are you being like this?

33:25.628 --> 33:30.091
I'm sorry for you 'cause I think
you can't handle all this... woman.

33:30.174 --> 33:32.510
-Jesus, Dawn. I'm just--
-[giggling]

33:33.928 --> 33:36.139
I know what you are.
You're a superficial asshole.

33:37.140 --> 33:37.974
I know.

33:41.185 --> 33:43.312
I'm respecting you and your problems.

33:43.896 --> 33:46.357
My problems? What problems?

33:46.441 --> 33:49.736
Look, I know about your stepfather,
how he molested you.

33:56.284 --> 33:57.452
Fuck you.

33:58.286 --> 34:00.538
Fuck you, that's not
what fucking happened, okay?

34:01.122 --> 34:02.665
Who the fuck told you that shit?

34:07.253 --> 34:08.546
[Talvinder] Who's next?

34:09.714 --> 34:11.340
[indistinct chatter]

35:38.094 --> 35:40.221
[suspenseful music playing]

37:10.895 --> 37:13.064
Hey, do you mind putting on
a pot of coffee?

37:13.814 --> 37:16.067
I guess we're gonna be up all night, huh?

37:16.150 --> 37:18.527
-Mm, yeah.
-Yeah.

37:18.611 --> 37:19.612
Thank you.

37:25.284 --> 37:27.495
-Open the door.
-Why should I do that?

37:27.578 --> 37:28.412
Open the door.

37:28.496 --> 37:30.039
-Why?
-I found something.

37:30.122 --> 37:32.291
What is it?
Just tell me, tell me right here.

37:32.375 --> 37:34.502
Dawn, it's fucking cold out here.
Open the door.

37:44.971 --> 37:46.430
Listen, listen, listen, listen.

37:46.514 --> 37:48.474
This whole thing-- This whole thing--
This whole thing-- Listen.

37:49.267 --> 37:50.518
It's not about Talvinder.

37:52.311 --> 37:54.188
-It's not?
-No, it's about Owen.

37:58.526 --> 38:00.778
-How do you know that?
-[grunting]

38:06.325 --> 38:08.119
Peter said he knows who the killer is.

38:09.203 --> 38:12.498
Well, good thing Mark knocked him out
before we got the chance to ask him.

38:15.501 --> 38:17.420
Unless you did that on purpose.

38:18.004 --> 38:21.048
-Are you accusing me of something?
-You were there when Renée was killed.

38:22.466 --> 38:24.302
I was unconscious.

38:24.385 --> 38:29.348
-Yeah, you could have staged that.
-Okay, okay, okay.

38:29.432 --> 38:32.977
If Peter knows who the killer is,
then-then we have to wake him up.

38:33.060 --> 38:35.104
-We have to wake him up.
-We can't just wake him up!

38:35.688 --> 38:36.897
He was lying to you.

38:36.981 --> 38:40.651
He was just trying to draw you outside
so that he could kill you too.

38:44.280 --> 38:46.198
Guys... is that Andi's hair?

38:49.827 --> 38:52.496
Guys, why does he have that?

38:53.414 --> 38:56.584
Maybe he wanted to keep it
as a memento. You know, a trophy.

38:58.002 --> 38:59.378
The way that serial killers do.

39:03.924 --> 39:05.134
[Dawn]  Don't trust anyone.

39:06.302 --> 39:07.636
That is the lesson here.

39:08.888 --> 39:10.556
She fooled us all.

39:12.391 --> 39:15.269
That girl sets feminism back
more than any man ever could.

39:15.853 --> 39:18.606
She's not a girl. She's a plague.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.567
She's worse than a plague.

39:21.650 --> 39:24.612
Plagues don't choose to be plagues.

39:26.113 --> 39:27.114
She's evil.

39:28.866 --> 39:29.950
So, we all agree.

39:31.452 --> 39:32.703
Something has to be done.

39:36.207 --> 39:39.585
We could fill her hairdryer
with corn starch.

39:39.668 --> 39:43.839
[scoffs] Um, well,
corn starch is pretty flammable,

39:43.923 --> 39:48.260
so unless we want
to set her head on fire...

39:48.344 --> 39:51.222
[Susan] Okay. So, we write her
a letter from her mom.

39:51.305 --> 39:53.015
We say, "You're a huge disappointment.

39:53.099 --> 39:55.101
I never loved you.
I should have had an abortion."

39:58.020 --> 40:00.856
That's fucked up, Susan. Jesus.

40:00.940 --> 40:02.983
Remind me never to piss you off.

40:04.068 --> 40:05.694
[Susan] Okay. Okay, fine, but...

40:07.154 --> 40:10.157
we're not starting
some little prank war thing,

40:10.241 --> 40:13.577
where we do something
and she does something back.

40:13.661 --> 40:15.704
We need to scare the life out of her.

40:18.707 --> 40:21.669
What about that "Talvinder on trial" idea?

40:22.878 --> 40:24.255
We get her to confess.

40:25.297 --> 40:30.010
We take her out in the middle of nowhere.
We make her walk back all by herself.

40:31.470 --> 40:32.847
She'll shit her pants.

40:35.516 --> 40:37.309
I'm so down for that plan.

40:40.646 --> 40:41.480
Okay.

40:43.524 --> 40:44.525
It's settled, then.

40:47.403 --> 40:49.155
Let's destroy that lying bitch.

40:51.365 --> 40:54.577
[crying] No, no, no, no, no!

40:56.120 --> 40:57.663
No, no, no.

40:59.707 --> 41:01.500
No, no, no, no, no.

41:03.127 --> 41:04.753
No, no, no, no.

41:06.755 --> 41:07.798
It can't be him.

41:07.882 --> 41:09.133
[suspenseful music playing]

41:19.477 --> 41:20.311
[Wren] Judith.

41:27.485 --> 41:28.611
Don't do it.

41:29.945 --> 41:30.779
Judith.

41:32.698 --> 41:33.699
Put the gun down.

41:39.288 --> 41:42.041
[footsteps approaching]

41:43.083 --> 41:44.084
What is it?

41:45.544 --> 41:47.713
Judith is not in her room.

41:47.796 --> 41:49.131
Well, where is she?

41:49.715 --> 41:52.676
I don't know. I've searched everywhere.
She's not in this house.

42:11.445 --> 42:13.072
There are some people...

42:15.991 --> 42:18.619
on the forks in the road of life...

42:19.495 --> 42:22.790
who persistently choose the wrong one.

42:23.707 --> 42:24.708
Please don't do it.

42:28.128 --> 42:28.963
Judith.

42:31.465 --> 42:32.299
Judith!

42:33.425 --> 42:36.178
How could I live now
that I know that you--

42:36.262 --> 42:37.471
'Cause I love you.

42:39.181 --> 42:41.934
I love you. I do.

42:43.978 --> 42:45.229
And you love me.

42:46.188 --> 42:48.107
It's not necessary. Give me the gun.

42:53.237 --> 42:56.865
Come on, Judith. What do they matter?
The only thing that matters is you and me.

42:58.325 --> 42:59.451
It's us.

43:03.080 --> 43:03.914
Wren...

43:06.292 --> 43:07.126
why?

43:08.335 --> 43:10.796
-How could you?
-Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.

43:12.798 --> 43:14.508
Judith, Judith, focus.

43:16.468 --> 43:18.220
-Hey, hey.
-[crying]

43:18.721 --> 43:19.805
Do you love me?

43:22.182 --> 43:24.018
Just be honest. Do you love me?

43:30.065 --> 43:30.899
Yes.

43:34.361 --> 43:36.030
Give me the gun.

43:37.323 --> 43:39.199
Just give me the gun.

43:54.089 --> 43:55.299
I love you so much.

43:57.593 --> 43:58.510
[sighs]

44:00.554 --> 44:01.513
So much.

44:03.932 --> 44:05.225
I love you too.

44:14.693 --> 44:15.778
[Mark] Judith!

44:16.779 --> 44:18.155
Judith!

44:18.739 --> 44:22.284
No! No! No! Don't do it!

44:23.077 --> 44:24.161
No!
