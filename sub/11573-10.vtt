WEBVTT

00:12.513 --> 00:14.970
Hey, pass me the pinot.
Oh, and the machete.

00:15.057 --> 00:19.471
Okay, intervention time. Does
this not seem wrong to you?

00:19.562 --> 00:22.679
Two incredibly sexy, hot girls,

00:22.773 --> 00:25.901
sitting at home, waxing their
weapons on a Friday night?

00:25.985 --> 00:28.897
Nope. But something about
that sentence makes me horny.

00:28.988 --> 00:33.402
Me too. Wouldn't you rather be
waxing Mr. Dyson's sword tonight?

00:33.492 --> 00:35.574
Dyson is working late.

00:35.661 --> 00:37.697
Besides, we're kind of in
limbo at the moment.

00:37.788 --> 00:40.370
Taking things slow, for once.

00:40.458 --> 00:42.744
I mean, we're great
together and everything,

00:42.835 --> 00:45.497
but we're also a lot of work.

00:45.588 --> 00:47.294
Gimme the six-inch.

00:47.381 --> 00:50.168
Honey, if I could give you the six-inch,
all our problems would be solved.

00:50.259 --> 00:52.875
Ha, ha. Don't flatter yourself.

00:52.970 --> 00:56.303
Look, all I'm saying is I think
we need to get out more.

00:56.390 --> 01:00.053
Oh, I get out. Believe me, I put myself
out there. It's not like I haven't tried.

01:00.144 --> 01:04.103
Men, women, humans, Fae,
that one time with a goat.

01:05.816 --> 01:07.397
--|'m kidding.
--Yeah.

01:07.485 --> 01:12.229
My point is that I am tired
of making the effort.

01:12.323 --> 01:15.190
I mean, if the universe wants me to
find love, it knows where to look.

01:15.284 --> 01:17.400
And I am in no rush.

01:17.495 --> 01:21.829
Let's face it, Kenzi,
the dating scene is killer.

01:23.459 --> 01:26.872
I'm glad we met. I had a really
great time with you tonight.

01:26.963 --> 01:28.703
Me too.

01:33.719 --> 01:35.505
Bye.

01:38.557 --> 01:41.094
Hey.

01:41.185 --> 01:43.767
You want to come back
to my place for a drink?

01:51.696 --> 01:53.857
Oh god, you're gorgeous.

02:48.336 --> 02:50.247
[screaming]

02:55.551 --> 02:58.509
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

02:58.596 --> 03:01.463
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

03:01.557 --> 03:04.469
My love carries a death sentence.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.676
l was lost for years,

03:06.771 --> 03:09.433
searching, while hiding,

03:09.523 --> 03:13.641
only to find that I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

03:13.736 --> 03:18.651
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

03:24.330 --> 03:28.573
The door was locked from the inside.
No sign of forced entry.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.168
Well, we'll see what the coroner says,

03:30.252 --> 03:33.915
but I am not seeing any
signs of foul play here.

03:34.006 --> 03:35.246
Ag reed.

03:35.341 --> 03:38.549
Still, that's one hell of a suicide note.

03:38.636 --> 03:40.501
No way was it a suicide.

03:40.596 --> 03:44.589
Sorry, but that's total bullshit.
My sister would not kill herself.

03:44.683 --> 03:47.925
And all that junk they say she
wrote on the wa||--whore, slut...

03:48.020 --> 03:49.135
Doesn't sound like her?

03:49.230 --> 03:51.562
No. She was a strong person.

03:51.649 --> 03:53.640
Well, did she ever show
any signs of depression?

03:53.734 --> 03:56.225
I mean, she was human.
She had her bad days.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.732
--What about the day she died?
--That's the thing.

03:58.823 --> 03:59.938
We live together.

04:00.032 --> 04:02.409
Her last voicemail told
me not to rush home,

04:02.493 --> 04:05.451
that she'd met a great guy
and she was feeling optimistic.

04:05.538 --> 04:09.952
Your flyers say that you only take
cases that no one else will believe.

04:10.042 --> 04:12.454
Well, the cops have
already ruled this a suicide.

04:12.545 --> 04:16.584
I need you to help
me prove them wrong.

04:16.674 --> 04:19.461
Don't get your hopes up on this one.
I worked it myself. It's pretty clean.

04:19.552 --> 04:21.884
You're sure it wasn't
some kind of homicide?

04:21.971 --> 04:24.633
Well, notjudging by this.

04:24.723 --> 04:26.554
Had to pry it from her
hand, postmortem.

04:26.642 --> 04:28.382
She cracked the shaft
with her muscle spasms.

04:31.021 --> 04:35.014
Which means it didn't just fall
in the water, she held it under.

04:36.277 --> 04:38.313
Couldn't somebody
have forced her hand?

04:38.404 --> 04:40.315
Without getting
deep-fried themselves?

04:40.406 --> 04:41.987
There was no sign of physical force.

04:42.074 --> 04:45.817
Yeah, but you and I both know that
certain people have ways around that.

04:49.665 --> 04:52.828
Theoretically, yes. It could have
been a Fae kill. You're right.

04:52.918 --> 04:55.250
Say that last part again.

04:55.337 --> 04:57.714
But this has been ruled a suicide.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.961
The humans are happy. And I can't do
much more with normal police resources

05:01.051 --> 05:02.666
without raising flags.

05:02.761 --> 05:04.217
So, you're cutting me off?

05:04.305 --> 05:05.511
Look, I would love to help you,

05:05.598 --> 05:09.261
but the most I can do is give
my stuff to the Fae labs.

05:09.351 --> 05:11.433
And that means you
have to talk to Lauren.

05:13.355 --> 05:14.481
--Come with me.
--No.

05:14.565 --> 05:17.557
No. That is just way too
awkward without beer.

05:17.651 --> 05:18.811
You're on your own, sista.

05:18.903 --> 05:20.439
Great.

05:20.529 --> 05:22.190
How have you been?

05:22.281 --> 05:23.521
Fine.

05:23.616 --> 05:25.698
You haven't been returning my calls.

05:25.784 --> 05:28.491
--Can we just...?
--Okay.

05:28.579 --> 05:33.369
I took a look at the file Dyson sent
over, had my people process it.

05:33.459 --> 05:37.202
Initial analysis indicates she
wrote the graffiti herself.

05:37.296 --> 05:38.456
What about Fae involvement?

05:38.547 --> 05:39.536
It's possible.

05:39.632 --> 05:43.420
If she was killed through some kind of
feeding, I don't recognize it offhand.

05:43.511 --> 05:45.422
Although, there are at
least a dozen types of Fae

05:45.513 --> 05:49.381
associated with anxiety, despair,
desperation, that kind of thing.

05:49.475 --> 05:51.340
So, what can you tell me?

05:51.435 --> 05:55.724
C.O.D. was myocardial fibrillation
from the electrocution.

05:57.191 --> 06:00.103
Death by hairdryer.
That's a lousy way to go.

06:00.194 --> 06:03.311
Also, she had sex about
an hour prior to her death.

06:03.405 --> 06:05.487
It appears consensual.

06:07.701 --> 06:11.193
Not so sure I trust your
judgment on sexual matters.

06:11.288 --> 06:12.243
Pardon?

06:12.331 --> 06:14.413
I mean, let's say, hypothetically,

06:14.500 --> 06:16.741
that one party thought
the connection was real,

06:16.835 --> 06:19.542
and then found out that the other party
was just manipulating them into bed

06:19.630 --> 06:21.791
to impress their controlling
asshat of a boss.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.999
Bo, do you really think that we weren't
headed that way on our own, anyway?

06:25.094 --> 06:28.803
I think that you ruined any
chance of us finding out.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.881
And I think that's really shitty.

06:31.976 --> 06:34.467
I don't know how many different
ways I can tell you that I'm sorry.

06:34.562 --> 06:35.847
Bo, if you'd just let me explain.

06:35.938 --> 06:38.350
Kenzi's waiting for me. I've got to go.

06:41.819 --> 06:45.437
Hit me with some hooch, T-Bag.

06:45.531 --> 06:47.988
T-Dawg?

06:48.075 --> 06:50.987
Please, sir, may I have some beverage?

06:52.079 --> 06:55.947
Here. Help yourself. I'm busy.

06:56.041 --> 06:58.532
Oh my god, it's like Christmas.

07:00.588 --> 07:05.207
[VALENTINE] Fitzpatrick
MacCorieghan of Clan Fin Arvin.

07:08.387 --> 07:11.299
Uh oh, trouble in the shire?

07:11.390 --> 07:14.052
This is your twenty-four
hour warning, Fitzpatrick.

07:14.143 --> 07:15.474
Fitzpatrick?

07:15.561 --> 07:18.803
Midnight tomorrow, I reclaim
possession of the Coin.

07:18.897 --> 07:21.434
I know what day it is, Valentine.

07:21.525 --> 07:23.061
[VALENTINE] Good.

07:23.152 --> 07:26.770
I'll see you tomorrow then
to take back what's mine.

07:28.574 --> 07:33.409
Unless, of course, you'd
like to hand it over now.

07:33.495 --> 07:38.410
Unless you'd like to lose your hand,
I suggest you step back until invited.

07:38.500 --> 07:41.708
Fair enough. Midnight then.

07:42.713 --> 07:46.831
And don't be late. You
know the consequences.

07:50.304 --> 07:53.046
What the Fae was that?

07:53.140 --> 07:54.926
Mind your business.

07:55.017 --> 07:57.599
There is some freaky
shit going on here.

07:57.686 --> 08:01.850
Two words--Lauren kiss-my-ass.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.441
Lotta hyphens in that last one.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.395
C'mon. We're already
late meeting Collette.

08:06.487 --> 08:09.149
Allison had sex before she died
and I want to know with who.

08:09.239 --> 08:12.823
Wait. Little guy, big mouth, must know.

08:19.875 --> 08:23.163
Did your sister say anything else about
the nice guy that she met that night?

08:23.253 --> 08:26.290
No, nothing. I wish she had.

08:26.382 --> 08:29.499
Sorry. It's strange talking about
her in the past tense like this.

08:29.593 --> 08:32.255
We can handle this, Collette,
if it's too much for you.

08:32.346 --> 08:34.177
Yeah, I think I might grab some air.

08:34.264 --> 08:35.879
Okay.

08:35.974 --> 08:37.589
These were Alli's.

08:37.685 --> 08:41.303
You can have them.
Just lock up when you're done.

08:49.279 --> 08:50.735
Anything upstairs?

08:50.823 --> 08:53.235
Just a fancy gitch collection.

08:53.325 --> 08:56.658
I'd say m'lady was single
and ready to crotch-mingle.

08:56.745 --> 08:59.532
Oh, Kenzi, you have the soul of a poet.

08:59.623 --> 09:01.659
I know this.

09:01.750 --> 09:04.992
I guess Allison was a little bit more
sentimental. Check out these titles--

09:05.087 --> 09:07.578
The Gigantic Romantic.

09:07.673 --> 09:11.336
Don't Let Love Go,
or Love Will Let Go of You.

09:12.636 --> 09:15.173
Actually, I bought this one, too.

09:15.264 --> 09:17.425
Looks like that's something
we had in common.

09:17.516 --> 09:19.723
Looking for love in
all the wrong places.

09:19.810 --> 09:23.177
Is that your way of saying anal?

09:23.272 --> 09:24.682
Hey, check this out,

09:24.773 --> 09:26.980
matchbooks from Crimson, a local bar.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.352
Looks like she's been there a lot.

09:28.444 --> 09:33.689
Recently. Check these. Credit charges
from Crimson the last three Fridays.

09:33.782 --> 09:35.568
All signed by Miss Allison.

09:35.659 --> 09:38.401
Well, T.G.|.F.

09:38.495 --> 09:39.951
Feel like going for a drink?

09:45.419 --> 09:47.159
Set phasers to douche.

09:47.254 --> 09:50.166
There is way too much gel
and chest waxing in this place.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.873
Ladies.

09:52.968 --> 09:55.334
You look great.

09:58.015 --> 10:00.552
Check it. Now you can actually go
online and look at photos of yourself

10:00.642 --> 10:03.224
having fun while you're still having it.

10:03.312 --> 10:05.473
What is that, the
Paparazzi for clubbers?

10:05.564 --> 10:09.273
Everybody wants to be famous.
It's the New World Order. Lame-o.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.270
Check that out.

10:11.361 --> 10:13.352
Every Friday? Sounds promising.

10:13.447 --> 10:14.903
Yeah.

10:31.965 --> 10:36.379
Ooh. Well, hello, ladies.
So glad you could join us.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.461
If you could just take your
nametags right over here,

10:38.555 --> 10:40.762
we'll be starting in a jiffy.

10:40.849 --> 10:46.389
Tonight's sharing topic, is, well, "my
favourite memory/my biggest regret"

10:46.480 --> 10:48.186
in two minute rounds or less.

10:48.273 --> 10:52.232
Okay? So, everyone, please,
please, enjoy yourself.

10:56.907 --> 10:58.818
--[BO] Speed dating.
--Oh, hell no.

10:58.909 --> 11:02.242
Oh, no, no, no. Easy, slim.
Think of it this way,

11:02.329 --> 11:07.073
we question these dudes a minute
at a time, we're out of here in fifteen.

11:07.167 --> 11:10.580
Yep. That was my definite
favourite memory of all time.

11:10.671 --> 11:13.083
Minus the rug burn.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.550
You know, my friend Allison
was with me that night

11:15.634 --> 11:19.172
and she's actually been here before.
Did you ever meet her?

11:19.263 --> 11:25.509
Oh, my favourite literary
quote about regret? Wow. Fun.

11:25.602 --> 11:30.767
Well, I think it was the
great poet Ludacris who said,

11:30.858 --> 11:37.445
"Regret is for suckaz. For suckaz. For
suckaz. Regret is for suckaz. Bitch."

11:39.116 --> 11:44.201
My biggest regret? Probably losing
touch with my best friend, Allison.

11:44.288 --> 11:50.500
You wouldn't happen to
recognize her, would you?

11:50.586 --> 11:55.580
What happy memories?
Those were hard times. So cold.

11:55.674 --> 12:01.010
That is why I'm here. If I could
maybe get loan from nice person,

12:01.096 --> 12:03.678
send chicken back to Mama.

12:05.017 --> 12:06.803
Well, what if I give you my number?

12:06.894 --> 12:10.728
You could be a sweet boy
and ask around for me, right?

12:12.357 --> 12:16.600
Wow! Didn't know this
was girl-on-girl, too.

12:26.330 --> 12:29.072
Okay, gorgeous. You got
about ten seconds to tell me

12:29.166 --> 12:31.578
why you're hunting on my turf.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.876
Burrgina.

12:38.842 --> 12:42.926
Hey! Hey, I want to talk to you.

12:43.013 --> 12:44.469
You know, I'm new in town

12:44.556 --> 12:46.933
and I really wasn't planning on
a turf war right out of the gate.

12:47.017 --> 12:48.257
So, if this is your place,

12:48.352 --> 12:50.638
it was just plain rude of you
not to mark your territory.

12:50.729 --> 12:52.060
What, like, pee on it?

12:52.147 --> 12:53.887
[BO] I don't know how to mark things.

12:53.982 --> 12:57.190
I don't know anything. You're the only
other succubus that I've ever met.

12:57.277 --> 13:00.861
What? How is that even possible?

13:00.948 --> 13:03.109
It's a long story.

13:03.200 --> 13:06.192
Can I buy you a beer
and tell you all about it?

13:06.286 --> 13:08.447
This is kind of a boring little town.

13:08.538 --> 13:10.574
We usually gravitate
to some place sexier.

13:10.666 --> 13:12.657
We're big in Berlin. You should
come with me some time.

13:12.751 --> 13:13.661
I'll introduce you around.

13:13.752 --> 13:16.835
Yeah, I would love that.

13:16.922 --> 13:19.334
So, how long are you
going to be in town?

13:19.424 --> 13:21.506
I don't know. I usually
travel around a bit.

13:21.593 --> 13:25.506
I set up a few regulars, some sugar
daddies in every port and all that.

13:25.597 --> 13:27.383
And then I just move
around, have fun with it.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.931
Travelling courtesan, huh?
That's your business?

13:30.018 --> 13:33.101
And business is naughty, thank god.

13:33.188 --> 13:37.227
So, what's your line?
Call girl, stripper, wife?

13:37.317 --> 13:40.275
Private investigator, actually.

13:40.362 --> 13:41.568
Pardon?

13:41.655 --> 13:47.821
I... I rent out my persuasion
services to people who need help

13:47.911 --> 13:51.369
finding loved ones, getting back
stolen goods, that kind of thing.

13:51.456 --> 13:53.117
You work?

13:55.669 --> 14:01.585
Oh, honey, succubi don't work.
I have so much to teach you.

14:01.675 --> 14:04.758
Wow. Look at the time. Yeah,
we probably should go, right?

14:04.845 --> 14:07.928
Yeah, I'm going to stay a bit
longer and pick her brain.

14:08.015 --> 14:11.132
So, if you're cool taking the car,
I'll grab a cab, okay?

14:11.226 --> 14:12.932
--Super cool.
--Coo|.

14:15.814 --> 14:17.475
So not cool.

14:17.566 --> 14:19.022
What?

14:20.193 --> 14:22.309
Are you listening to me?

14:22.404 --> 14:23.314
No, Kenzi.

14:23.405 --> 14:27.114
Shocking news from Galileo--you're not
actually the centre of the universe.

14:27.200 --> 14:30.567
Wow. First, Bo and now you.
That's... that's great.

14:30.662 --> 14:32.869
You know what, next person
that wants to crap on me

14:32.956 --> 14:34.321
can find me at home.

14:34.416 --> 14:36.623
Wait. Wait, wait.

14:36.710 --> 14:41.044
Look, I'm really sorry. I'm under
a lot of pressure right now,

14:41.131 --> 14:43.042
but that's no excuse.

14:43.133 --> 14:44.213
Thanks.

14:44.301 --> 14:46.633
Actually, I could really
use your help right now.

14:46.720 --> 14:47.926
Should I go get Bo?

14:48.013 --> 14:52.347
No, no, I meant your
help, specifically you.

14:52.434 --> 14:53.549
Do tell.

14:53.643 --> 14:57.181
Not here. Downstairs.

14:57.272 --> 14:59.228
It's called the Coin of Jahayla.

14:59.316 --> 15:01.932
It brings luck in business
to its possessor.

15:02.027 --> 15:05.736
Valentine and I found it
together a long time ago.

15:05.822 --> 15:08.313
And what, you made some
kind of Coin timeshare deal?

15:08.408 --> 15:10.569
In a manner of speaking.

15:10.660 --> 15:13.993
Cutting the coin in half
would destroy its essence.

15:14.081 --> 15:17.539
So, we alternate possession
every hundred years.

15:17.626 --> 15:18.957
It's my turn to return it.

15:19.044 --> 15:20.875
And you don't want to give it back.

15:20.962 --> 15:23.954
I can't. It's missing.

15:24.049 --> 15:27.507
I locked it up for
safekeeping this past turn.

15:27.594 --> 15:31.462
And yesterday, when I went to
retrieve it, it was gone from its box.

15:31.556 --> 15:33.467
I've looked everywhere.

15:33.558 --> 15:35.970
Merde. So, what can I do?

15:36.061 --> 15:39.679
Well, I know a way of
tracking the Coin, a ceremony.

15:39.773 --> 15:43.357
But it requires a human
female to complete it.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.183
--Is this some kind of sex thing?
--What? No, no.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.564
Or, like, a virgin sacrifice? 'Cause I
don't think I can help you with that.

15:47.656 --> 15:51.319
No, no, no, no.
I'm not sacrificing anyone.

15:51.409 --> 15:55.778
Ijust need to--| need help
from this particular Fae

15:55.872 --> 15:59.205
that only talks to female humans.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.828
All right, I'm in.

16:00.919 --> 16:02.034
Great.

16:02.129 --> 16:06.042
I got to gather some supplies.
Meet me back here tomorrow?

16:07.634 --> 16:09.295
Virgin sacrifice.

16:09.386 --> 16:12.253
Right. 'Cause that's never
happened with you people.

16:12.347 --> 16:13.302
Are you sure you haven't seen her?

16:13.390 --> 16:15.551
She's been to the club
the last few Fridays.

16:15.642 --> 16:19.635
Well, I recognize her, but I've never
talked to her. She's not my type.

16:19.729 --> 16:22.141
And you didn't see anyone
suspicious around? Any Fae, maybe?

16:22.232 --> 16:25.099
Sorry, Fae-dar isn't
really a succubus gift.

16:25.193 --> 16:27.058
You think the killer could be Fae?

16:27.154 --> 16:29.611
Well, that's what I'm
trying to figure out.

16:29.698 --> 16:32.735
Well, good then, I want to help.
Two succubi are better than one.

16:32.826 --> 16:35.863
Well, no offence, but why would
you put yourself out like that?

16:35.954 --> 16:40.072
I mean, if this is murder, the
killer is killing humans, not Fae.

16:40.167 --> 16:42.453
You really don't
understand how this works.

16:42.544 --> 16:46.207
If anybody is hunting on my territory,
I want to know about it.

16:46.298 --> 16:48.380
Besides, I want to see you
in action, Nancy Drew.

16:48.466 --> 16:50.297
See how the other half lives.

16:50.385 --> 16:52.046
And the sooner I can
help you solve the case,

16:52.137 --> 16:55.300
the sooner I can
teach you to cut loose.

17:01.688 --> 17:05.101
Allison was such a lovely
young lady. I mean,

17:05.192 --> 17:08.400
so poised and full of life. I just
can't believe that she killed herself.

17:08.486 --> 17:10.397
Well, neither can her sister.

17:10.488 --> 17:13.355
That's why she hired me to see if
anything else could be involved.

17:13.450 --> 17:15.657
Look, if there's anything
I can do, please, I mean--

17:15.744 --> 17:17.951
Were there any strange
men at these events?

17:18.038 --> 17:21.030
Any complaints from
the other women?

17:21.124 --> 17:26.118
Well, none. I mean, we have an
industry-leading screening process.

17:26.213 --> 17:29.046
You see, Allison was a star client.

17:29.132 --> 17:34.297
She was a great conversationalist.
She made the men feel welcome.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.719
The last few sessions, every
man there checked off her

17:36.806 --> 17:38.216
"would like to see her again" box.

17:38.308 --> 17:41.721
Well, did any special
dates come out of that?

17:41.811 --> 17:47.226
You see, girls like Allison,
they could afford to be picky.

17:47.317 --> 17:50.605
The last two sessions,
she didn't check a single box.

17:50.695 --> 17:52.981
I'm going to need to see the list
of the men from those nights.

17:53.073 --> 17:54.859
Look, I really want to help,

17:54.950 --> 17:57.942
but I'd have to check with head office.

18:00.372 --> 18:03.034
You don't really need to do that.

18:03.124 --> 18:05.831
You trust me, right?

18:09.297 --> 18:13.006
Well, I do have these names right
here if you'd like to look at them.

18:13.093 --> 18:14.549
Great.

18:16.388 --> 18:20.006
You know, you should really think
about joining our mixer nights.

18:25.522 --> 18:27.308
Not bad for a rookie.

18:27.399 --> 18:29.765
Come on, I'll drive you home.

18:33.071 --> 18:37.064
[cell phone ringing]

18:37.158 --> 18:39.774
Hey, I just got off. Do you
want to go for a drink?

18:39.869 --> 18:43.032
No thanks. I've had enough
of bars for one night.

18:43.123 --> 18:44.988
Hey, look, I've got some
possible leads on this case.

18:45.083 --> 18:46.289
Can you follow some up for me?

18:46.376 --> 18:47.126
Depends, what are they?

18:47.168 --> 18:50.752
Names of guys the deceased met while
speed dating in the last few weeks.

18:50.839 --> 18:52.375
I'm e-mailing them to you now.

18:55.844 --> 18:56.879
pretty please?

18:56.970 --> 18:59.928
Yeah, I think I can manage that.
How was your evening?

19:00.015 --> 19:05.351
It was very surprising.
I'll see you tomorrow.

19:05.437 --> 19:09.271
You're kidding, right? You don't
actually live like this, a succubus?

19:09.357 --> 19:10.563
What, is your box broken?

19:10.650 --> 19:13.187
Ha. Shut up and come have some wine.

19:13.278 --> 19:14.438
Who was on the phone?

19:14.529 --> 19:15.735
My cop friend.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.062
And it was swell knowing
you. I gotta go.

19:17.157 --> 19:19.193
Oh. no, no, no, no.
He's cool. He's Light Fae.

19:19.284 --> 19:20.990
It's even worse. I thought
you said you were neutral.

19:21.077 --> 19:22.533
--I am.
--Well, I don't have that luxury,

19:22.620 --> 19:23.655
I'm Dark Fae.

19:23.747 --> 19:26.033
So, if we're going to be cool,
keep the Light out of my business.

19:26.124 --> 19:28.331
--I can do that.
--Good.

19:29.753 --> 19:32.119
Now ask me anything
you want to know.

19:34.341 --> 19:35.831
So, I never really thought,

19:35.925 --> 19:38.416
does that mean that my
real mother is a succubus?

19:38.511 --> 19:41.924
Probably. Or your dad
could be an Incubus.

19:42.015 --> 19:45.052
Fae genetic lineage is
pretty complicated.

19:45.143 --> 19:49.432
One or both of your parents
are probably sex chi eaters.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.433
But, even then, there's
a bunch of variety.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.776
There's Lilin, Yuki Onna, Rusalka--

19:53.860 --> 19:56.272
Wait, slow down. Slow down.

19:56.363 --> 19:57.773
Oh my god, you're adorable.

19:57.864 --> 20:00.480
You know what, forget the notes, okay?

20:00.575 --> 20:02.987
I'm not going anywhere.
I can teach you all this stuff.

20:03.078 --> 20:07.663
I really appreciate that.
You have no idea.

20:07.749 --> 20:11.241
I've been feeling lost
for a really long time.

20:13.671 --> 20:16.663
So, if you guys do it, will you,
like, create a black hole

20:16.758 --> 20:19.044
or cancel each other out or something?

20:19.135 --> 20:22.343
Actually, I'm not all that
attracted to my own kind.

20:22.430 --> 20:25.888
I'm more of a novelty whore.

20:25.975 --> 20:29.308
I should be going. I'll see
you at Collette's tomorrow?

20:29.396 --> 20:31.603
Yeah. Sounds good.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.691
Why are you talking
to her about the case?

20:37.779 --> 20:39.986
Hello, she could be involved.

20:40.073 --> 20:42.610
Yeah, I already thought about
that, Sherlock. I'm not an idiot.

20:42.700 --> 20:46.693
But I know a succubus kill when I see
one, and that is not how Allison died.

20:46.788 --> 20:49.245
Also, she had hetero sex that night.

20:49.332 --> 20:50.868
Saskia isn't exactly a dangler.

20:50.959 --> 20:52.449
Well, I wouldn't be so sure.

20:52.544 --> 20:53.909
Besides, I think you're
just hanging out with her

20:54.003 --> 20:55.664
for the succubus contact high.

20:55.755 --> 20:58.132
Well, is that really so bad?

20:58.216 --> 21:01.629
I mean, she's the only one of
my kind that I have ever met.

21:01.719 --> 21:03.710
I just want to see where this goes.

21:05.557 --> 21:08.299
But if you want me to
keep my distance...

21:08.393 --> 21:13.228
Don't be stupid. I understand.
It's fine. I just worry about my girl.

21:13.314 --> 21:17.899
Okay. Well, that is why
I love you so much.

21:17.986 --> 21:19.271
Now I'm going to hit the hay.

21:19.362 --> 21:21.774
Saskia and I are going to talk
to Collette in the morning.

21:21.865 --> 21:23.480
Good night.

21:31.249 --> 21:33.240
Yes? Can I help?

21:39.549 --> 21:41.289
Well, I did a check on the speed daters.

21:41.384 --> 21:43.124
They all came up clean.

21:43.219 --> 21:47.007
Seriously? Oh, dammit!

21:47.098 --> 21:48.474
Look, I know it sounds crazy,

21:48.558 --> 21:51.015
but I really think there's
something to this case.

21:51.102 --> 21:53.434
Well, fortunately, I've grown
to trust your instincts,

21:53.521 --> 21:55.557
so I dug a little deeper.

21:55.648 --> 21:56.512
In the past five years,

21:56.608 --> 21:58.439
a dozen single women
have committed suicide,

21:58.526 --> 22:01.233
all leaving this signature graffiti.

22:01.321 --> 22:04.609
It's way outside what you'd expect
to find. It's definitely a pattern.

22:04.699 --> 22:08.317
Shit. Collette was right.

22:08.411 --> 22:10.823
Look, I can't officially
get involved anymore.

22:10.914 --> 22:13.781
But if you need my help, I'm there.

22:13.875 --> 22:15.786
Want me to come with
you to see this client?

22:15.877 --> 22:20.587
No. Actually, I can handle
this one on my own.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.664
You okay? Seem a
little different today.

22:22.759 --> 22:28.504
No, I'm fine. I'm fine. It was just a
late night and a monster hangover.

22:28.598 --> 22:30.429
You need me, you call.

22:30.517 --> 22:35.136
I always do. And thank you.

22:39.567 --> 22:41.068
Hello?

22:41.152 --> 22:44.269
This is so not cool. Have you
never heard of beauty sleep?

22:44.364 --> 22:46.855
Hey, I want to get her before
she goes to work, okay?

22:46.950 --> 22:48.656
Collette!

22:49.994 --> 22:52.155
Shit.

22:52.247 --> 22:54.408
Jesus. Collette.

22:56.125 --> 22:58.582
She's already cold.

22:58.670 --> 23:03.380
You need to tell me about this graffiti.
Did her sister do this kind of thing, too?

23:03.466 --> 23:06.799
Yeah. Yeah, in her journal
and on some walls.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.797
Shit. We need to get out of here.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.219
Why? What is it?

23:10.306 --> 23:11.216
An Albaster.

23:11.307 --> 23:13.468
--What?
--Move.

23:19.482 --> 23:25.273
We'll need salt from the
Pyrenees. Bull Tallow.

23:25.363 --> 23:28.196
And remember, don't look
into her eyes for too long.

23:28.283 --> 23:30.148
Lightning Birds hate that.

23:30.243 --> 23:31.699
Why do we need this chick again?

23:31.786 --> 23:36.200
Witch doctors swear by their eggs
for finding lost or stolen goods.

23:36.291 --> 23:38.623
I'm going to use these items
to summon her lightning.

23:38.710 --> 23:39.916
It's the way she travels.

23:40.003 --> 23:41.743
Nice ride.

23:41.838 --> 23:43.874
So, what's my angle here?

23:43.965 --> 23:47.674
Talk her out of one of her eggs
when she appears, if you can.

23:47.760 --> 23:48.545
I'd do it myself,

23:48.636 --> 23:52.094
but Lightning Birds can't be
seen or heard by any other Fae.

23:52.181 --> 23:54.092
So, it's all on you.

23:55.518 --> 23:57.725
Why can't you just tell Val, like,

23:57.812 --> 24:00.929
"Hey, man, about the Coin,
whoops, I don't gots it no more."

24:01.024 --> 24:03.310
Well, partly honour,
I'd never hear the end of it.

24:03.401 --> 24:05.187
[KENZI] And the rest?

24:05.278 --> 24:08.270
To prevent just such a thing,
we both put up collateral.

24:08.364 --> 24:10.025
What was yours?

24:10.116 --> 24:11.981
You're sitting in it.

24:13.244 --> 24:18.409
The Dal? Oh, man, Trick.

24:18.499 --> 24:20.660
We are not going to let that happen.

24:22.879 --> 24:26.588
See you tonight. After sundown.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.874
Albasters are our natural enemies.

24:29.969 --> 24:31.209
In what way, exactly?

24:31.304 --> 24:34.091
Succubi feed off and create
sexual pleasure, right?

24:34.182 --> 24:36.423
Albasters do the same
with sexual shame.

24:36.517 --> 24:38.929
So, what, they make people
feel bad about liking sex?

24:39.020 --> 24:43.389
Women mostly, quelle surprise.
Bunch of puritans.

24:43.483 --> 24:45.690
They cause massive guilt
over any sexual behaviour,

24:45.777 --> 24:50.988
leading to shame spirals, eating
disorders and, ta-dah, suicide.

24:51.074 --> 24:52.234
Good thing this case is solved.

24:52.325 --> 24:53.815
Baby Fae like you is totally unmatched.

24:53.910 --> 24:56.071
No, this is not over. I let Collette down.

24:56.162 --> 24:59.029
If I can find this bastard,
I'm going to go after him.

24:59.123 --> 25:00.158
Wow! Go, you.

25:00.249 --> 25:02.911
Okay, so what's next?
We know what we're looking for,

25:03.002 --> 25:04.162
but how do we find them?

25:04.253 --> 25:07.290
Well, we know Allison hooked up
with someone the night that she died.

25:07.382 --> 25:09.794
It doesn't look like it was
any of the speed daters.

25:09.884 --> 25:13.342
What if she met her killer on her
way home from speed dating?

25:13.429 --> 25:16.466
Yeah. Or on her way out.

25:16.557 --> 25:19.094
She'd have to pass through
the main bar like we did, right?

25:19.185 --> 25:21.847
Yeah.

25:21.938 --> 25:23.678
You still have that photographer's
card from the club?

25:23.773 --> 25:25.684
Of course, hang on.

25:30.780 --> 25:32.566
So, what, exactly, are we looking for?

25:32.657 --> 25:34.568
Club candids from the
night that Allison died.

25:34.659 --> 25:36.991
See if we can put her with
any faces from the main bar.

25:37.078 --> 25:39.490
This is kind of exciting.
Maybe I should get a hobby.

25:39.580 --> 25:40.660
See? I'm converting you.

25:40.748 --> 25:42.784
Not if I convert you first.

25:43.710 --> 25:44.950
[BO] Hey, there she is.

25:45.044 --> 25:47.126
Yeah, but who's Captain Handsome?

25:47.213 --> 25:50.501
Ooh! Oh, I recognize him.
He's this total pick-up artist.

25:50.591 --> 25:52.331
He hits on lonely women
at the end of the night.

25:52.427 --> 25:53.963
Usually comes in around last call.

25:54.053 --> 25:56.214
Gives us just enough time.
Are you coming with?

25:56.305 --> 26:01.095
No, my dance card is full.
But, you know, don't wait up.

26:04.397 --> 26:08.561
Whoa! You were not shitting
about the lightning part.

26:08.651 --> 26:10.562
I try not to "shit" about things.

26:10.653 --> 26:12.268
So, what now?

26:12.363 --> 26:15.730
Now... we wait.

26:15.825 --> 26:18.407
See if she shows herself.

26:20.955 --> 26:22.695
What are you doing?

26:22.790 --> 26:26.282
Lightning Birds are like magpies.
They like to steal things,

26:26.377 --> 26:30.620
shiny things, from
the people they help.

26:30.715 --> 26:35.300
About that--| have been re-evaluating.
Entrepreneur to entrepreneur--

26:35.386 --> 26:37.126
You're not an entrepreneur.
You're a thief.

26:37.221 --> 26:40.805
Semantics. What I'm trying to say
is we need to negoshe, okay?

26:40.892 --> 26:43.474
If I help save your bar tonight,
I want ten percent ownership.

26:43.561 --> 26:44.391
No.

26:44.479 --> 26:46.094
--I want the Coin for a year.
--No.

26:46.189 --> 26:47.725
I want a Unicorn.

26:47.815 --> 26:49.351
No.

26:49.442 --> 26:53.060
Forgiveness of my tab and
free drinks for life. Come on.

26:53.154 --> 26:55.361
Okay. But nothing top shelf.

26:55.448 --> 26:56.654
Fine.

26:56.741 --> 26:59.858
Why don't you get comfortable?
This could take a while.

27:03.289 --> 27:05.200
She's here.

27:12.590 --> 27:14.501
Oh, lord.

27:48.167 --> 27:49.828
You can call me Gloris.

27:49.919 --> 27:51.284
Gloris.

27:51.379 --> 27:56.544
You know, I've always liked you
humans. Never ask me for anything.

27:56.634 --> 28:01.549
But this one, I bet you
he's just like all the rest.

28:01.639 --> 28:04.051
He wants one of my eggs, right?

28:04.141 --> 28:06.974
Yeah. That bastard.

28:07.061 --> 28:09.347
--Kenzi!
--Just don't do it.

28:09.438 --> 28:10.689
They don't own you.

28:10.773 --> 28:13.059
Exactly. Thank you.

28:13.150 --> 28:13.935
Kenzi.

28:13.985 --> 28:16.271
[KENZI] Yeah, like, who
do they think they are,

28:16.362 --> 28:18.728
calling you out of nowhere? Screw 'em.

28:18.823 --> 28:19.858
If they want an egg,

28:19.949 --> 28:23.407
there is a damn grocery store
across the street. Am I right?

28:23.494 --> 28:24.700
[GLORIS] Amen.

28:24.787 --> 28:27.403
You said it, sister.

28:31.252 --> 28:33.584
Of course, you could always
beat them at their own game.

28:33.671 --> 28:35.036
I'm listening.

28:35.131 --> 28:36.462
Forget the petty theft.

28:36.549 --> 28:40.133
Ask for a future favour,
something valuable in return.

28:40.219 --> 28:43.382
You see, what I'm saying here,
Gloris, is you have a hot commodity.

28:43.472 --> 28:46.964
You're a business woman.
All you need is an agent.

28:47.059 --> 28:47.923
Oh, dear god.

28:48.019 --> 28:51.352
A human, perhaps, to handle
these exchanges for you.

28:51.439 --> 28:53.521
Like, I could negotiate with Trick.

28:53.608 --> 28:58.477
That he take this egg in exchange
for a future favour to you.

28:58.571 --> 28:59.902
He would do that?

28:59.989 --> 29:03.197
I am sure he would do that,
wouldn't he?

29:03.284 --> 29:08.028
I would be happy to offer a future
favour in exchange for her egg.

29:08.122 --> 29:13.537
Whoo! Child, I do like you.

29:17.798 --> 29:19.834
Here.

29:19.926 --> 29:22.963
Ah. It's still warm.

29:23.054 --> 29:29.766
Well, this has been a treat. But I
must get back to my nest now.

29:29.852 --> 29:36.690
Although, I don't know why he
wasted his time calling little old me.

29:36.776 --> 29:38.357
Such a martyr, this one.

29:38.444 --> 29:39.229
What do you mean?

29:39.278 --> 29:41.485
Well, he could get whatever
he wanted if he just started

29:41.572 --> 29:44.154
writing in his Book of Blood again.

29:44.241 --> 29:49.452
Well, the most powerful are
always the most stubborn, huh?

29:55.294 --> 29:57.125
What did she say?

30:08.724 --> 30:10.225
Ooh.

30:11.644 --> 30:13.180
This is your lucky night.

30:13.270 --> 30:15.477
Oh, I can definitely sense that.

30:15.564 --> 30:19.148
Yeah, how about last Friday?
Did you get lucky then?

30:19.235 --> 30:21.191
Oh, not like this.

30:21.278 --> 30:24.862
Focus. You met a girl named
Allison that night, didn't you?

30:24.949 --> 30:25.734
Oh, yeah.

30:25.783 --> 30:27.444
Yeah. And you had sex?

30:27.535 --> 30:28.820
Definitely.

30:28.911 --> 30:30.822
And then you killed her.

30:30.913 --> 30:34.121
Oh, wait. She's dead?

30:34.208 --> 30:35.448
[BO] Did you kill her?

30:35.543 --> 30:37.704
What? No!

30:37.795 --> 30:40.753
Girl, take the training
wheels off already.

30:46.470 --> 30:48.131
[BO] Saskia.

30:51.058 --> 30:53.265
Saskia, that's enough.

30:53.352 --> 30:54.933
I said that's enough!

30:56.147 --> 30:58.934
Unclench, okay. I know what I'm doing.

30:59.025 --> 31:02.108
He tastes human, but he
still might know something.

31:02.194 --> 31:03.604
[BO] Saskia, you're going to kill him.

31:03.696 --> 31:06.278
[SASKIA] Relax. Watch and learn.

31:13.831 --> 31:18.120
Oh. Oh, what a rush.

31:18.210 --> 31:19.120
Do that again.

31:19.211 --> 31:22.578
First, tell the truth, lover.
Do you know who killed Allison?

31:22.673 --> 31:26.916
I swear to god, she was alive
and sleeping when I left.

31:27.011 --> 31:30.048
I may be a player, but I'm no killer.

31:30.139 --> 31:33.597
Okey dokey. As long as
we're clear. Bye now.

31:35.311 --> 31:39.145
Hey, wait. Come on.

31:39.231 --> 31:40.437
Can I get your number?

31:40.524 --> 31:44.437
How... how did...
You brought him back.

31:44.528 --> 31:47.110
How did you do that? Can I do that?

31:47.198 --> 31:50.816
See? I told you I had
so much to teach you.

32:06.759 --> 32:09.717
Great. Now I feel like an omelette.

32:13.682 --> 32:21.976
Okay. The amulet will show us where
the Coin is at this precise moment.

32:30.032 --> 32:32.648
There.

32:32.743 --> 32:35.576
Which is currently a cemetery.

32:35.663 --> 32:40.202
Of course it is. Awesometown.
Where are you going?

32:40.292 --> 32:45.036
To get us some flashlights...
and some muscle. Let's call Hale.

32:46.132 --> 32:47.372
Thanks again for the ride home.

32:47.466 --> 32:50.754
And I'm serious. I want you
to show me that chi thing.

32:50.845 --> 32:52.506
Also, I've got some
thoughts about the case,

32:52.596 --> 32:56.259
so let's have a coffee
tomorrow and talk, okay? Bye.

32:59.395 --> 33:01.351
Hello, whore.

33:12.658 --> 33:16.617
You're the Albaster?
What are you doing here?

33:16.704 --> 33:18.490
Well, you were asking for it.

33:18.581 --> 33:22.574
When you pulled that little whore's
trick in the bar and revealed yourself.

33:22.668 --> 33:26.252
I mean, come on. You know I
couldn't resist educating a succubus.

33:26.338 --> 33:27.919
Educating?

33:29.425 --> 33:33.885
You know, I think you're the
remedial one here, buddy.

33:33.971 --> 33:37.964
I am happy to give you a free lesson.

33:38.058 --> 33:39.514
Hmm.

33:54.158 --> 33:58.697
[HALE] Oh, this place creeps me out.
I don't care who knows it.

33:58.787 --> 34:01.745
This place creeps everybody out.

34:02.958 --> 34:05.540
Give me a hand with the lid.

34:05.628 --> 34:07.084
Yeah.

34:15.429 --> 34:16.839
I'm not seeing it. You?

34:16.931 --> 34:19.798
It's got to be in here.
The amulet's never wrong.

34:19.892 --> 34:21.177
The egg showed you
where the Coin was

34:21.268 --> 34:22.883
at the exact moment you asked, right?

34:22.978 --> 34:24.434
Yes.

34:27.900 --> 34:31.188
C'mon. I know where
the Coin is. Let's go.

34:31.278 --> 34:32.939
Let's go!

34:35.991 --> 34:37.197
Why did you kill Collette?

34:37.284 --> 34:39.616
You told me she was
stirring up trouble.

34:39.703 --> 34:40.488
If you didn't tell me,

34:40.537 --> 34:42.573
she'd still be alive today.
How does that make you feel?

34:42.665 --> 34:46.032
Give up, Bertram. You're used
to picking on innocent humans.

34:46.126 --> 34:47.957
I am out of your league.

34:48.045 --> 34:50.036
None of those bitches were innocent.
Every single one of them

34:50.130 --> 34:52.416
gave in to desires of the
flesh at one point in time.

34:52.508 --> 34:55.671
Well, so will you when I'm done.

35:07.690 --> 35:09.897
What's the matter, huh?
You don't like girls?

35:09.984 --> 35:11.520
I don't like anything.

35:11.610 --> 35:16.479
I'm above all of that.
Pleasure is for the weak, like you.

35:20.619 --> 35:23.201
Ah! What's happening?

35:23.289 --> 35:25.951
You see, when I'm done with you,
you're going to take a little nap.

35:26.041 --> 35:28.202
And you're going to wake up
knowing exactly what a dirty,

35:28.294 --> 35:31.001
worthless slattern you really are
and how you don't deserve to live.

35:31.088 --> 35:33.295
No.

35:33.382 --> 35:38.342
This is easier than I expected.
A succubus with a conscience.

35:38.429 --> 35:43.219
For your kind, what a
wonderful amount of shame.

35:44.351 --> 35:46.216
Bad news, Bert.

35:57.948 --> 36:00.985
'Cause I'm pretty goddamn shameless.

36:04.955 --> 36:09.699
Bo, are you okay? I was so worried
when you didn't answer your phone.

36:09.793 --> 36:12.660
Bo, come on. Come on,
sugar. Shake it off.

36:12.755 --> 36:14.541
Here, take some from me.

36:21.597 --> 36:22.803
Where is he?

36:22.890 --> 36:24.846
That's my girl.

36:26.185 --> 36:27.721
What are you thinking?

36:27.811 --> 36:32.225
I'm thinking he's not going to
like this threesome. At all.

36:35.527 --> 36:38.940
That pool table would look
good in my den. Measure it.

36:39.031 --> 36:42.398
Have that lamp appraised,
probably antique.

36:45.996 --> 36:47.497
It's time, old friend.

36:47.581 --> 36:49.321
It certainly is.

36:51.919 --> 36:53.910
J 'accuse.

36:54.004 --> 36:57.292
Admit it. You pulled a Dutch Heifer.

36:57.383 --> 36:58.714
Pardon?

36:58.801 --> 37:02.089
A Boston Fandango?

37:02.179 --> 37:04.261
Anybody...?

37:05.641 --> 37:10.010
You pulled a fast con, buddy. I don't
know the mystical Fae specifics,

37:10.104 --> 37:13.221
but whatever coin you gave
Trickster was a dissolving fake.

37:13.315 --> 37:16.682
You have had the Coin of
Jahaylah the whole time.

37:16.777 --> 37:20.235
And you definitely had it at a
cemetery you visited this afternoon,

37:20.322 --> 37:22.563
leaving behind these flowers.

37:22.658 --> 37:27.118
Hey! Trick, you aren't going to
listen to this human's tripe.

37:27.204 --> 37:30.537
Very closely. As should you.

37:30.624 --> 37:33.866
I can prove it. It's a very simple test.

37:33.961 --> 37:38.455
Hale, be a darling dove and
frisk our guest, vigorously.

37:38.549 --> 37:40.631
--You got it.
--All right!

37:40.717 --> 37:45.427
All right. There's no need to be gauche.

37:47.558 --> 37:49.423
Can't blame a guy for trying.

37:50.811 --> 37:52.472
Watch me.

37:57.317 --> 37:59.023
Bye-bye.

38:07.578 --> 38:09.694
You enjoying yourself?

38:11.415 --> 38:15.454
Great. More whores.

38:15.544 --> 38:18.286
Is it me, or is he being hurtful?

38:18.380 --> 38:20.837
Very.

38:20.924 --> 38:26.715
Face it, Mister Prude. You are
as horny as the rest of us.

38:26.805 --> 38:31.265
It's just that judging others is
the only thing that gets you off.

38:31.351 --> 38:35.310
Well said. Now, let's
heat things up a bit.

38:38.650 --> 38:41.892
Admit it. You like that, don't you?

38:41.987 --> 38:43.488
More.

38:43.572 --> 38:50.444
Face it, Bertram. You are a pathetic
hypocrite and now you know it, huh?

38:50.537 --> 38:53.495
I am done with him. I'm calling Dyson.

38:58.420 --> 39:01.162
[groaning]

39:16.230 --> 39:17.970
What did you do?

39:18.065 --> 39:19.225
What he deserved.

39:19.316 --> 39:21.898
Okay, good. You scared him.

39:21.985 --> 39:25.398
Now bring him back,
like the guy from the alley.

39:25.489 --> 39:28.322
I don't think so, girlfriend.
He tried to kill you. Not cool.

39:28.408 --> 39:29.363
Sass, he'll die.

39:29.451 --> 39:31.407
Well, gee, I hope so.
Otherwise, I'm losing my touch.

39:31.495 --> 39:32.405
No, this isn't funny.

39:32.496 --> 39:34.578
What's the problem?
You've killed before.

39:34.665 --> 39:37.031
Yeah, for survival or self-defence.

39:37.125 --> 39:40.333
And I'm not proud of that. He is tied
up and helpless. This is murder.

39:40.420 --> 39:42.206
Well, according to you,
what he did was murder,

39:42.297 --> 39:44.549
so I prefer to think of
this as an execution.

39:44.633 --> 39:48.171
What, you think your cop in
shining armour can do jack to him?

39:48.262 --> 39:54.007
He's Dark Fae. And trust me, my people
could give a damn about dead humans.

39:54.101 --> 39:55.136
But you do.

39:55.227 --> 40:01.348
No. I care about you and me.

40:01.441 --> 40:03.978
Succubi stick together.

40:04.069 --> 40:08.278
I attacked him, one of my
own clan, to protect you.

40:08.365 --> 40:12.449
I'm the one my people will
make pay if they find out.

40:14.121 --> 40:17.329
--Are you going to narc on me?
--What? No.

40:17.416 --> 40:20.078
No, but I didn't sign up for this.
I don't want any part of it.

40:20.168 --> 40:21.669
Fine, I'll go.

40:21.753 --> 40:24.005
No, you can't leave. I don't
know how to bring him back.

40:24.089 --> 40:25.954
I can't do this without you.

40:26.049 --> 40:32.090
No, you can't. There is so much
to teach you. Come with me.

40:32.180 --> 40:34.136
You are not who I thought you were.

40:34.224 --> 40:39.218
And I had higher hopes for you, too.
But I'm not giving up on you yet.

40:41.231 --> 40:45.099
When you're ready to learn more
about yourself, come find me.

40:49.448 --> 40:52.485
Hey, hey, stay with me.
Stay with me, Bertram.

40:52.576 --> 40:54.157
[cell phone ringing]

40:54.244 --> 40:58.032
Dyson, I need help. Bertram.
Look at me. Look at me.

40:59.708 --> 41:01.244
Well, if he's local, he's not one of ours.

41:01.335 --> 41:02.791
He's Dark Fae.

41:02.878 --> 41:07.542
That complicates things.
But he obviously pursued you.

41:07.633 --> 41:08.543
And even the Dark agree

41:08.634 --> 41:11.341
you have the right to defend
yourself in your own home.

41:11.428 --> 41:13.168
Well, we have to make that
clear to the Morrigan.

41:13.263 --> 41:15.925
I intend to.

41:16.016 --> 41:19.053
I'll handle this, Bo. Make it go away.

41:23.398 --> 41:25.229
I wish you could.

41:33.200 --> 41:38.035
So, you know we're closed, right?
You planning on moving in?

41:38.121 --> 41:40.032
No rush to go home.

41:40.123 --> 41:44.241
Okay. What's going on
between you and Bo?

41:44.336 --> 41:48.045
What? Nothing.

41:48.131 --> 41:51.373
She's just busy making
new friends and shit.

41:51.468 --> 41:54.926
Well, a little bird once told me

41:55.013 --> 41:58.801
people rarely take you for
granted, unless you let them.

41:58.892 --> 42:03.352
Well, a Lightning Bird once told
me something about you, too.

42:03.438 --> 42:04.848
Hmm?

42:04.940 --> 42:08.649
That you're powerful.
Can make things happen.

42:08.735 --> 42:11.397
Something about some Book of Blood.

42:11.488 --> 42:13.399
Do you know anything about that?

42:13.490 --> 42:14.730
No, I don't.

42:14.825 --> 42:20.411
Takes a con to know a con.
You have secrets, Trickster.

42:20.497 --> 42:25.116
And you have a wild imagination.

42:25.210 --> 42:30.705
Go home, urchin.
Remind Bo why she needs you.

42:33.760 --> 42:35.091
Hey, hoochie.

42:35.178 --> 42:38.170
So, not to panic you, but I
just thought you should know

42:38.265 --> 42:40.722
you have a big B.F.F. competition.

42:40.809 --> 42:45.428
Trick is, like, totally horning
in on your Kenzi time and--

42:45.522 --> 42:47.888
Hey.

42:47.983 --> 42:49.814
What's wrong? You okay?

42:49.901 --> 42:55.521
Yeah. Yeah, it was just a
rough night. And I missed you.

42:55.615 --> 42:57.947
You want to talk about it?

42:58.034 --> 43:01.993
You know what?
We always talk about me.

43:02.080 --> 43:05.038
I want to hear about
Kenzi's latest adventures.

43:05.125 --> 43:08.162
Oh my god. Where do I start?

43:08.253 --> 43:13.839
Okay, first, he will deny it, but Trick
totally tried to virgin sacrifice me.

43:13.925 --> 43:16.837
And then he made me, like, steal
this egg from this lady-bird person.

43:16.928 --> 43:17.792
A what?

43:17.888 --> 43:19.844
Pay attention. It gets weirder.

43:19.931 --> 43:22.593
And then there was this, like,
little crazy guy named Valentine

43:22.684 --> 43:25.801
and he was so annoyingly
mean and I felt so bad for Trick

43:25.896 --> 43:29.980
'cause he was stressing out
big-time, but thank god for Kenzi...

43:30.066 --> 43:33.024
