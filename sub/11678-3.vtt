39:55.679 --> 39:57.840
"Beloved" is a bit ofa stretch.

40:14.531 --> 40:17.056
Thanks for the car, Dad.

40:17.134 --> 40:19.534
I thinkyou'dlike howit looks.

40:23.807 --> 40:26.537
- We meet here?
- You wanted someplace safe.

40:26.610 --> 40:31.013
It's quiet, lots of cover. Two guys in
business suits don't raise any eyebrows.

40:31.081 --> 40:33.675
You should have more meetings outside, Thabet.
Get some color.

40:33.750 --> 40:37.049
You were always good, Michael.
It's a shameyou're out.

40:37.120 --> 40:39.520
I'm gonna get back in.

40:41.892 --> 40:44.656
I've enjoyed our friendship.
But--

40:44.728 --> 40:47.561
But don't call you ever again.
I got it.

40:51.067 --> 40:53.126
Michael.

40:55.071 --> 40:57.335
Be careful.

41:03.480 --> 41:06.074
[Michael Narrating]
An alphanumeric tracking code...

41:06.149 --> 41:09.414
and a special access program
code name.

41:09.486 --> 41:12.387
It's not much, but it's a start.
