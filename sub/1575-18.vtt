00:03.417 --> 00:05.709
Finally, I'm invited
to Steve and Roger's

00:05.709 --> 00:07.333
Stews and Views Night --

00:07.333 --> 00:10.667
Delicious stews and gut-bustin'
Internet videos.

00:10.667 --> 00:12.792
People said threatening
suicide on Facebook Live

00:12.792 --> 00:14.583
was over the line,
but I made it,

00:14.583 --> 00:16.500
and I don't care
how I got here.

00:16.500 --> 00:18.417
Whatever.
The stews are a-stewin'.

00:18.417 --> 00:22.375
Let's get the videos
a-downlewdin'!

00:22.375 --> 00:23.667
"Newscaster bloopers."

00:23.667 --> 00:25.333
Hey, how about this one?

00:25.333 --> 00:27.709
What really happened here
at South Lanceton High School

00:27.709 --> 00:29.208
that led to Billy Carson's
death --

00:29.208 --> 00:31.417
The is this?!

00:31.417 --> 00:33.208
I'm dying in this
country-ass town!

00:33.208 --> 00:34.917
Shit flying in my mouth!

00:34.917 --> 00:36.959
We need to get the

00:39.250 --> 00:42.166
Dad, are you gonna
move back in with Mom?

00:42.166 --> 00:44.291
Klaus:
Gadzooks! Is that Steve?

00:44.291 --> 00:46.875
Sorry, son. No can do.

00:46.875 --> 00:49.291
But what I can do is get
an 18-inch pizza

00:49.291 --> 00:50.959

02:01.834 --> 02:04.000
Like all Hollywood
fairy tales,

02:04.000 --> 02:06.750
this one begins at
the mall food court.

02:06.750 --> 02:09.500
And like all meals
at the mall food court,

02:09.500 --> 02:13.375
it ends in a messy
pile of shit.

02:13.375 --> 02:15.125
Franny used to dress us as
brothers,

02:15.125 --> 02:19.041
because Twice Cream offers free
ice cream to pairs of twins.

02:19.041 --> 02:21.458
Triplets get nothing,
unless one of them waits outside

02:21.458 --> 02:23.750
while the other two go in.
I saw that once.

02:23.750 --> 02:25.834
Reported it immediately.
Got a free cone.

02:25.834 --> 02:29.125
Steve: Anyway, we were spotted
by a local casting agent.

02:29.125 --> 02:31.000
Soon, we were
snagging more roles

02:31.000 --> 02:33.208
than a poor family
at a Golden Corral.

02:33.208 --> 02:34.959
That's good.

02:34.959 --> 02:36.583
It was like we were
real brothers.

02:36.583 --> 02:38.583
Getting into twin antics
on set,

02:38.583 --> 02:41.166
or as we called them,
"twinanigans."

02:41.166 --> 02:42.834
We were a dynamite tandem.

02:42.834 --> 02:46.041
Steve could cry on cue,
and I could eat on cue!

02:46.041 --> 02:48.667
Eventually, we were approached
by Hollywood agents

02:48.667 --> 02:51.083
from the Twinseltown
Talent Agency.

02:51.083 --> 02:52.959
Yep, we were gonna be big.

02:52.959 --> 02:55.500
As big as Matt
and John Amendola,

02:55.500 --> 02:58.000
who are not famous but just
these two really cool guys

02:58.000 --> 03:00.125
I went to high school with
and I-I sort of use them

03:00.125 --> 03:03.750
as the standard for what I hope
to achieve in my life.

03:03.750 --> 03:06.792
But then, Grammy legend
Quit-sey Jones over here

03:06.792 --> 03:09.000
-pulled the plug!
-I was 5, Roger!

03:09.000 --> 03:10.500
I had to start
kindergarten!

03:10.500 --> 03:11.917
You boned us, Steve.

03:11.917 --> 03:13.583
We'll never know how far
we could've gone!

03:13.583 --> 03:17.208
We could've been on the cover
of Double-Stuffed Magazine,

03:17.208 --> 03:20.208
the only magazine
dedicated solely to twins,

03:20.208 --> 03:23.166
double-penetration,
and Oreos!

03:27.583 --> 03:29.792
It's important
to go on walks.

03:29.792 --> 03:31.500
So my body doesn't
forget how.

03:31.500 --> 03:33.667
I like when cars
drive by too fast,

03:33.667 --> 03:35.458
so I can grab
my crotch and yell,

03:35.458 --> 03:36.959
"Slow down, ya jagoff!

03:36.959 --> 03:40.500
We got friggin' kids here!"

03:40.500 --> 03:42.041
Running messes up
my knee.

03:42.041 --> 03:44.125
Walking is less
stressful on my body.

03:46.417 --> 03:48.542
Oh, my God!
I'm so, so sorry!

03:48.542 --> 03:50.125
But I'm in

-We should call the police.
-Hang on, girlie.

03:57.917 --> 04:00.000
We've got a blank check here --
Damn it!

04:00.000 --> 04:02.250
It's a credit card
for Spencer's Gifts.

04:02.250 --> 04:06.291
So, we can only use it at that
novelty store at the mall?

04:06.291 --> 04:09.291
"Where membership
has its bene-farts"?

04:09.291 --> 04:10.792
And it also says
that memberships

04:10.792 --> 04:12.750
are non-trans-fartable.

04:12.750 --> 04:14.458
There's actually a lot
of fine print here,

04:14.458 --> 04:17.417

pretty good fart jokes.

pretty cool about it.

Twinseltown Talent.

20:08.750 --> 20:11.709
Roger, just because
we stopped being fake twins

20:11.709 --> 20:14.500
doesn't mean we aren't
still real fake brothers.

20:17.041 --> 20:21.333
N-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!

20:29.083 --> 20:30.542
Roger!

20:30.542 --> 20:31.792
Tell you what, Steve.

20:31.792 --> 20:33.583
I think I'm done with acting.

20:33.583 --> 20:37.583
In fact, you could say I don't
have the stomach for it anymore.

20:37.583 --> 20:40.250
Ow! Ohh.

20:40.250 --> 20:42.792
So, bro, you gonna
miss show biz?

20:42.792 --> 20:45.250
Eh, acting was always
temporary for me.

20:45.250 --> 20:47.917
You know I have my heart set
on pharmaceutical sales.

20:47.917 --> 20:49.291
Aah, a huge rat!

20:51.625 --> 20:54.458
Oh, it's just an old T-shirt.
Grab that for me, Steve.
