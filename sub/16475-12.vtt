00:02.252 --> 00:03.504
Hello?

00:04.588 --> 00:06.047
I followed all your rules.

00:06.089 --> 00:09.885
I'm unarmed.

00:06.089 --> 00:09.885
I'm not wearing a wire.

00:09.927 --> 00:13.347
I came alone.

00:09.927 --> 00:13.347
There's no backup.

00:13.388 --> 00:17.017
Come on, man. I need your help

00:13.388 --> 00:17.017
to take down your brother.

00:20.771 --> 00:23.607
Doug Judy.

00:20.771 --> 00:23.607
The Pontiac Bandit.

00:23.649 --> 00:24.650
Hey, baby.

00:24.692 --> 00:25.734
Nice legs.

00:25.776 --> 00:26.902
Why are you in your boxers?

00:26.944 --> 00:28.529
So you would know

00:26.944 --> 00:28.529
I'm not wearing a wire.

00:28.570 --> 00:30.155
Your buddy Scott

00:28.570 --> 00:30.155
said I had to.

00:30.197 --> 00:32.282
Oh, that makes sense.

00:30.197 --> 00:32.282
Scott's a perv.

00:32.324 --> 00:34.576
Hey, Scott,

00:32.324 --> 00:34.576
wherever you're watching from,

00:34.618 --> 00:35.661
go home!

00:35.703 --> 00:37.371
<i>Sorry, man.</i>

00:35.703 --> 00:37.371
[footsteps receding]

00:37.412 --> 00:38.372
So what's so important?

00:38.413 --> 00:40.457
I'm looking

00:38.413 --> 00:40.457
for your foster brother, George.

00:40.499 --> 00:42.292
Hate the guy.

00:40.499 --> 00:42.292
Stole from my mom,

00:42.334 --> 00:43.335
burned our house down.

00:43.377 --> 00:44.628
Worst of all, he ran off

00:44.670 --> 00:47.088
with my LP of Phil Collins'

00:44.670 --> 00:47.088
<i>No Jacket Required.</i>

00:47.130 --> 00:48.340
It's my favorite album.

00:48.382 --> 00:49.174
Haven't heard it in 20 years.

00:49.216 --> 00:51.010
I mean,

00:49.216 --> 00:51.010
can't you just stream it?

00:51.050 --> 00:53.679
Can't do that to Phil.

00:51.050 --> 00:53.679
<i>Sussudio</i> demands vinyl.

00:53.721 --> 00:54.763
Right. Vinyl and whatnot.

00:54.805 --> 00:56.640
Okay, well,

00:54.805 --> 00:56.640
George is a murderer now,

00:56.682 --> 00:58.183
and he just escaped

00:56.682 --> 00:58.183
from prison.

00:58.225 --> 01:00.060
We think he might be trying

00:58.225 --> 01:00.060
to flee the country.

01:00.101 --> 01:01.144
You want me to help you

01:00.101 --> 01:01.144
catch him?

01:01.186 --> 01:02.688
Like when X-men teamed up

01:01.186 --> 01:02.688
with Magneto

01:02.730 --> 01:03.689
to stop Apocalypse.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.524
-I heard that one was bad.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.524
-Wasn't great.

01:05.566 --> 01:06.734
I still want to see it, though.

01:06.775 --> 01:07.985
I'd watch it again.

01:08.027 --> 01:09.277
-So does that mean you're in?

01:08.027 --> 01:09.277
-Of course I am.

01:09.319 --> 01:11.530
Damn, it feels good

01:09.319 --> 01:11.530
to be on the same team for once.

01:11.572 --> 01:14.199
A cop and a criminal working

01:11.572 --> 01:14.199

You told me to cut a deal.

I thought you'd maybe drop

01:51.820 --> 01:55.365

and you've lost

fell for that.

02:32.945 --> 02:34.488
Plus, his deal

02:32.945 --> 02:34.488

do you know he'll be there?

Oh, I see. So the only thing

Why would George Judy

11:21.931 --> 11:23.642
steal all these cars

11:21.931 --> 11:23.642
and not the egg?
