WEBVTT

00:02.436 --> 00:04.136
Okay, guys, Mommy and I
are gonna be leaving

00:04.138 --> 00:06.505
in a couple minutes,
and we're, uh...

00:06.507 --> 00:08.674
(chuckles)

00:08.676 --> 00:10.275
Are you watching
<i> The Hangover?</i>

00:10.277 --> 00:13.479
Uh, no, that's rated R.

00:13.481 --> 00:15.147
Uncle Don came in
and turned it on.

00:15.149 --> 00:17.549
It's way better
than<i> SpongeBob.</i>

00:19.453 --> 00:23.055
I sat on the remote
and it just came on.

00:23.057 --> 00:25.190
That's not what happened at all.

00:25.192 --> 00:26.492
He searched for it,
found it, and then said,

00:26.494 --> 00:27.793
"Buckle up, kids."

00:29.530 --> 00:31.030
Come on, man.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.600
I also told you
not to tell your dad.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.603
Hey, what's with
the suit?

00:37.605 --> 00:39.438
Looks like you're selling pianos
at the mall.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.374
It's Valentine's Day.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.109
I'm taking Andi out

00:44.111 --> 00:45.577
because I love her.
Hmm.

00:45.579 --> 00:48.113
And because she told me to.

00:48.115 --> 00:50.449
Really doing it up
fancy, huh?

00:50.451 --> 00:52.051
Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:52.053 --> 00:54.286
I called three weeks ago
to get us in at Staiano's

00:54.288 --> 00:55.721
for dinner and dancing,

00:55.723 --> 00:59.391
pre-ordered their special
lovers package for two,

00:59.393 --> 01:01.760
and had the truck detailed for
when she throws herself at me

01:01.762 --> 01:03.595
on the way home.
Hmm.

01:03.597 --> 01:05.497
I forgot nothing.

01:05.499 --> 01:08.233
Who's babysitting tonight?
I forgot something.

01:08.235 --> 01:10.469
Oh, this is not good,

01:10.471 --> 01:12.571
I don't have a babysitter.

01:12.573 --> 01:15.374
Wha-- hey, are you and Marcy
doing anything special tonight?
No.

01:15.376 --> 01:17.643
Every night I let Marcy lay
her head on this bear skin rug.

01:17.645 --> 01:20.212
So, you know,

01:20.214 --> 01:22.514
it's always Valentine's Day
at our house.

01:22.516 --> 01:25.150
Sounds like it's always
Halloween at your house.

01:26.387 --> 01:28.821
So can you babysit?
Let me call Marcy.

01:28.823 --> 01:30.689
(phone rings)
Hello?

01:30.691 --> 01:32.524
Hey, babe, I got a question
about tonight.

01:32.526 --> 01:35.494
So do I, where are you taking me
for Valentine's Day?

01:35.496 --> 01:38.163
We got a big night
ahead of us, baby,

01:38.165 --> 01:40.299
so lay out
my good underwear.

01:41.469 --> 01:42.835
I can't babysit,
I screwed up big.

01:42.837 --> 01:44.470
I got to find some place
to take Marcy.

01:44.472 --> 01:46.405
Wha... you're never
gonna get in

01:46.407 --> 01:48.574
anywhere on Valentine's Day.

01:48.576 --> 01:51.410
Hey, I snuck into three Cher
concerts, I could do anything.

01:52.446 --> 01:53.579
(door closes)

01:55.449 --> 01:56.715
So are you guys
not going out?

01:56.717 --> 01:58.817
No, no, no,
I can still save this.

01:58.819 --> 02:00.552
I'll call Marie.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.454
She's been single
a long time.

02:02.456 --> 02:05.624
It's a sad, sad-- Marie!

02:05.626 --> 02:07.159
Hey, uh, any chance

02:07.161 --> 02:09.495
you could babysit tonight?
No can do.

02:09.497 --> 02:12.564
I'm here with your favorite
kindergarten teacher,

02:12.566 --> 02:14.900
and we are drowning
our sorrows in meat.

02:14.902 --> 02:17.302
Hey, Burns, the best thing
about tonight

02:17.304 --> 02:19.371
is I've hit rock bottom.

02:19.373 --> 02:20.906
I can only go
up from here.

02:23.844 --> 02:26.578
Katie, some phone calls
make you feel very lucky.

02:27.615 --> 02:29.748
Lowell, it's Adam.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.216
Hey.

02:31.218 --> 02:32.818
Hey, uh, can you watch
my kids tonight?

02:32.820 --> 02:35.487
I wish I could, Adam,
but I've got romantic plans

02:35.489 --> 02:37.222
with my wife all night.

02:40.161 --> 02:43.295
Time for lefty.

02:44.465 --> 02:46.165
Oh, I am in big trouble.

02:46.167 --> 02:47.699
Big trouble.

02:47.701 --> 02:49.168
I could babysit.

02:49.170 --> 02:50.669
What?

02:50.671 --> 02:52.504
Wait.

02:52.506 --> 02:55.174
Wait, wait.

02:55.176 --> 02:57.609
Yeah, you're 13,
you're old enough now.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.578
Yeah, and happy
to do it any time.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.847
Wasn't even thinking
about any time.

03:01.849 --> 03:05.384
I was just thinking
about tonight.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.553
Yeah, but any time
means, like,

03:07.555 --> 03:09.488
if I have to run back to
the office, you'll be here.

03:09.490 --> 03:12.591
Or if Mom and I want to
see a movie, you'll be here.

03:12.593 --> 03:15.627
Or if we just don't want
to be here, you'll be here!

03:18.465 --> 03:20.199
This could
change our lives.

03:21.468 --> 03:23.602
One thing though,
if I babysit,

03:23.604 --> 03:25.737
it's gonna cost you
three dollars an hour.

03:25.739 --> 03:28.307
Three dollars an hour?

03:28.876 --> 03:30.509
Katie, honey...

03:30.511 --> 03:32.511
that's not how
you negotiate, okay?

03:32.513 --> 03:34.313
You go high, I go low.

03:34.315 --> 03:36.815
Start at, like,
ten or $15.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.717
Okay.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.419
$15, then.

03:40.421 --> 03:41.954
No, no, no, no, it's three,
you already said three.

03:44.625 --> 03:47.426
Whoa, look at you.

03:47.428 --> 03:49.661
And look at you.

03:49.663 --> 03:52.431
I can't wait to get
you out on the town.

03:52.433 --> 03:53.732
(chuckles)
When's the babysitter
getting here?

03:53.734 --> 03:57.302
Ah, Valentine's
surprise number one.

03:57.304 --> 03:59.605
She's already here.
Oh.

03:59.607 --> 04:00.839
In fact,

04:00.841 --> 04:03.709
she's been here
for 13 years.

04:03.711 --> 04:07.379
She's responsible,
well-raised,

04:07.381 --> 04:09.748
you know her and you
love her, it's Katie!

04:11.652 --> 04:14.753
(chuckles) You forgot to book
a babysitter, didn't you?

04:14.755 --> 04:17.923
That's Valentine's
surprise number two.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.725
Yeah, honey,

04:19.727 --> 04:21.660
I-I just don't think
she's ready yet.

04:21.662 --> 04:24.863
I mean, babysitters need to be
a little more, you know, mature.

04:24.865 --> 04:27.599
Wha...
You let Uncle Don babysit.

04:27.601 --> 04:32.304
Good point, Katie,
my smartest child. Huh?

04:32.306 --> 04:33.739
Don was here
for five minutes

04:33.741 --> 04:36.541
and Emme learned
every bad word ever.

04:36.543 --> 04:38.777
They're all up here now.

04:40.314 --> 04:42.014
Okay, Adam, we need to talk
in the kitchen.

04:42.016 --> 04:44.383
(sighs)
That means no.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.852
Do you see
how smart she is?

04:46.854 --> 04:48.287
Look, I tried everyone.

04:48.289 --> 04:49.755
Katie is our
only option.

04:49.757 --> 04:51.423
Look, I'm fine with
Katie babysitting.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.058
Just not our kids.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.793
Yeah, I mean, let her
work out all the kinks

04:54.795 --> 04:57.596
on that frog killer,
Tabitha, down the street.

04:57.598 --> 05:01.600
Andi, the restaurant's only
a few minutes away, okay?

05:01.602 --> 05:03.935
The kids will watch a movie,
we'll have some dinner,

05:03.937 --> 05:05.704
dance to Sinatra,

05:05.706 --> 05:07.406
maybe squeeze in a little

05:07.408 --> 05:09.408
truck action
on the way home.

05:09.410 --> 05:10.676
Come on.

05:10.678 --> 05:11.977
I don't know.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.412
It's just scary
to think about

05:13.414 --> 05:15.681
leaving her in charge.
I mean,

05:15.683 --> 05:17.416
I have bras
older than her.

05:18.686 --> 05:23.055
And like those bras,
Katie has been through a lot.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.060
Look, she helps me
already, okay?

05:28.062 --> 05:29.661
When we get home from school,

05:29.663 --> 05:31.330
she gives Teddy and Emme
their snacks,

05:31.332 --> 05:32.998
she gets them started
on their homework.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.067
She's really good at it.

05:35.069 --> 05:37.569
Isn't that what
you're supposed to be doing?

05:38.739 --> 05:41.006
Let's not get bogged down
in details, okay?

05:41.008 --> 05:42.507
You know what?
Look, look, look,

05:42.509 --> 05:44.076
if...

05:44.078 --> 05:47.412
if Katie starts babysitting,
we can go out whenever we want.

05:47.414 --> 05:50.716
All right? We can be that
spontaneous, happy couple

05:50.718 --> 05:54.686
we used to be before the kids,
you know, ruined everything.

05:57.091 --> 05:59.925
I think it's fun to
stay home with the kids.

06:02.529 --> 06:05.464
They can't hear you.
You can tell the truth.

06:05.466 --> 06:06.898
Look, can we just
try it for tonight?

06:06.900 --> 06:09.868
Okay, fine.
All right?
Okay.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.904
But if anything goes wrong
at the house while we're gone,

06:12.906 --> 06:14.806
Katie babysitting
goes on the list of things

06:14.808 --> 06:16.842
you are not allowed
to ask me to do again.

06:16.844 --> 06:18.443
Okay, sure, sure, sure.

06:18.445 --> 06:19.878
I'll put it
next to skydiving

06:19.880 --> 06:21.646
and that thing I tried
on New Year's Eve.

06:21.648 --> 06:23.081
Now, let's...

06:23.083 --> 06:25.817
let's do this before
you change your mind, okay?

06:25.819 --> 06:27.586
That's what you said
on New Year's Eve.

06:29.456 --> 06:31.656
Katie,

06:31.658 --> 06:34.126
your mother and I have
decided to let you babysit.

06:34.128 --> 06:35.994
EMME AND TEDDY:
Yay!
Really?! That's amazing!

06:35.996 --> 06:38.397
I won't let you down,
I promise.
Okay. All right.

06:38.399 --> 06:39.931
But I have some rules,
all right?

06:39.933 --> 06:42.000
No running, no jumping,
no climbing, no fighting,

06:42.002 --> 06:44.770
no biting, no cooking,
all right?

06:44.772 --> 06:46.805
A-And no trying anything
for the first time.

06:46.807 --> 06:49.408
If you're not already great
at it, don't do it, okay?

06:50.744 --> 06:52.110
(chuckles)
Okay, listen,

06:52.112 --> 06:54.813
if you need anything, you call
me, not your mother, me.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.581
Got it?
Got it.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.850
Okay. And...

06:58.852 --> 07:00.919
if you need anything,
you call me, okay?

07:03.590 --> 07:05.724
(all say good-byes)

07:05.726 --> 07:07.793
Be good, bye!
Oh, and lock this door.

07:07.795 --> 07:08.860
Don't answer
this door.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.195
Nothing with doors.

07:10.197 --> 07:12.197
Doors equal death.

07:17.204 --> 07:19.104
(knocking on door)

07:21.508 --> 07:22.874
And you're dead.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.011
¶ ¶

07:35.789 --> 07:38.523
Do you think it's
too early to call home?

07:38.525 --> 07:40.592
Honey, we left six
and a half minutes ago.

07:42.529 --> 07:44.029
The kids are in good hands,
will you just relax?

07:44.031 --> 07:46.865
Okay, well, as long as
everything is fine at home,

07:46.867 --> 07:48.767
I'm fine.
Well...

07:48.769 --> 07:50.569
I like this place.
Mm.

07:50.571 --> 07:51.887
It's fancy.
Yeah.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.204
You know, when I went to
the ladies' room,

07:53.207 --> 07:55.941
the toilet seat
was heated. Yeah.

07:55.943 --> 07:57.476
And not from somebody else
sitting on it.

07:57.478 --> 07:59.077
Oh.

07:59.079 --> 08:02.080
Oh, and, since I'm only paying
Katie three dollars an hour,

08:02.082 --> 08:05.617
I am gonna order us the second
cheapest bottle of wine.

08:05.619 --> 08:07.819
Mm.
(chuckles)

08:07.821 --> 08:10.655
Hi, may I help you?
Hey, yeah, uh, we have
a reservation for two.

08:10.657 --> 08:11.690
Burns.

08:11.692 --> 08:13.158
Hmm. Oh,
I just seated

08:13.160 --> 08:14.659
the Burns party.

08:14.661 --> 08:15.994
(chuckles)

08:15.996 --> 08:18.563
I think I would've
remembered if that happened.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.132
Is that Don?

08:21.134 --> 08:23.502
Yes.

08:23.504 --> 08:26.838
That seven-foot howler monkey
stole our table.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.841
What the hell are you doing
at our table?

08:29.843 --> 08:32.811
I took a gamble you
wouldn't find a babysitter.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.145
I kind of bet
my marriage on it.

08:34.147 --> 08:36.181
Okay, well,

08:36.183 --> 08:37.682
Marcy's looking at me,

08:37.684 --> 08:39.251
so tell me
all the lies quickly.

08:39.253 --> 08:41.853
I told her I invited you guys
here to surprise her.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.222
And that you're fighting,
and that's why you looked mad.

08:47.761 --> 08:49.027
Okay, fine,
but you are buying us

08:49.029 --> 08:50.695
the third cheapest
bottle of wine.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.197
No problem.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.832
I'm not doing that.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.867
(phone rings)

08:55.869 --> 08:57.636
(grumbles)

08:57.638 --> 08:59.704
Oh, no,
Katie's calling me.

08:59.706 --> 09:02.874
Katie, hey.
Are you okay?

09:02.876 --> 09:04.643
Uh, yeah, we're fine.
I think that fuse blew again,

09:04.645 --> 09:05.944
the lights went out.

09:05.946 --> 09:07.779
Oh, oh, you just have
to reset the breaker.

09:07.781 --> 09:10.282
You know where the breaker box
is out on the garage wall?

09:10.284 --> 09:12.984
Yeah, you mean that thing you
told me to touch never ever?

09:12.986 --> 09:16.021
That was when you were four,
but you're old enough now.

09:16.023 --> 09:17.289
Just-- but, uh,
before you open it,

09:17.291 --> 09:18.690
bang your hand on the cover

09:18.692 --> 09:21.760
a couple of times
to scare the spiders.

09:21.762 --> 09:24.729
Spiders? We'll just leave the
power off till you come home.

09:24.731 --> 09:25.931
No, no, no, no, no, if...

09:25.933 --> 09:27.732
if the power's off
when Mom gets home,

09:27.734 --> 09:30.735
we'll never get our
spontaneous life back.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.704
What are you talking about?
You'll understand in 30 years.

09:32.706 --> 09:34.773
You know what?
I'll be home in a minute.

09:34.775 --> 09:36.942
Okay, listen,
I got to run home,

09:36.944 --> 09:39.110
but Andi can't know that
Katie called or that I left,

09:39.112 --> 09:40.345
so cover for me,
all right?

09:40.347 --> 09:41.880
Tell her that, uh...

09:41.882 --> 09:43.782
Tell her you saw me
running into the bathroom.

09:43.784 --> 09:45.884
Yeah, got it. You were sweating,
your hands were on your butt.

09:45.886 --> 09:49.688
Right? And you were screaming,
"Oh, Lord help me."

09:49.690 --> 09:51.189
What? No, no!

09:51.191 --> 09:53.658
What's the matter?
Too religious?

09:56.763 --> 09:59.698
(keys jingle)
Hey, hi, everyone.
Okay, it's just me.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.967
Hi. How's everybody doing?
You good? Good? Okay.

10:01.969 --> 10:03.902
Playing a board game,
that's nice. All right, good.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.804
Just gonna run out here
and trip the breaker.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.872
All right, nothing--
will only take a second.

10:07.874 --> 10:09.140
Okay.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.743
Lights will be
on in a second.

10:11.745 --> 10:13.712
And the lights
are back on. Yeah.

10:13.714 --> 10:16.247
Okay, all right, that's good.
And I can...

10:16.249 --> 10:18.883
see that there's a spider on me!

10:18.885 --> 10:23.688
This is so fun that Don invited
you guys here to surprise me.

10:23.690 --> 10:25.957
Yeah, we're
all surprised.

10:27.160 --> 10:30.729
Hey, what'd I miss?

10:30.731 --> 10:31.813
Hey, how's your tummy?

10:31.814 --> 10:32.896
Don said you had to
borrow a pair of pants

10:32.899 --> 10:34.899
from the lost and found.

10:36.870 --> 10:38.803
Thanks, Don.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.038
No, it was just

10:40.040 --> 10:41.706
an upset stomach,
but I feel great so,

10:41.708 --> 10:43.241
uh, let's get out night started.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.943
May I have this dance?

10:48.048 --> 10:49.881
Happy Valentine's Day.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.416
Here are your personalized
champagne glasses

10:51.418 --> 10:53.785
that were included
in your lovers package for two.

10:53.787 --> 10:55.120
(gasps)

10:55.122 --> 10:58.189
Why do they say
Adam and Andi?

10:58.191 --> 11:00.058
What?

11:00.060 --> 11:01.426
Well, shouldn't they have
our names on them?

11:01.428 --> 11:03.361
I mean,
you did make the reservation.

11:03.363 --> 11:07.832
Or is there something going on
that I should know about?

11:07.834 --> 11:10.435
Just that this is an outrage!

11:10.437 --> 11:13.304
This is fun.
(Adam chuckles)

11:13.306 --> 11:15.106
(phone buzzing)
Is that your phone buzzing?

11:15.108 --> 11:16.374
Um...
Oh, is it Kate?

11:16.376 --> 11:17.742
Well, let me check.

11:17.744 --> 11:18.843
Uh,

11:18.845 --> 11:19.878
no...

11:19.880 --> 11:20.879
No, no, no.

11:20.881 --> 11:22.113
No, that's a, uh, uh,

11:22.115 --> 11:23.982
an alarm that I set for myself

11:23.984 --> 11:27.352
to remind me to tell you
that I love you.

11:27.354 --> 11:28.453
Oh...

11:28.455 --> 11:30.155
I love you, I got to go.

11:30.157 --> 11:31.322
Wait, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:31.324 --> 11:32.991
Go where?

11:32.993 --> 11:36.728
Babe, a love like ours
is beyond questions.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.068
Listen, what's so hard about
getting a name on a glass?

11:43.070 --> 11:45.437
I'm begging you,
find a Sharpie and get it done.

11:46.707 --> 11:48.373
Katie called again,
I got to call her back.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.208
Okay, I'll stand in front
of you so Andi can't see.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.843
Fine, fine, yeah.

11:51.845 --> 11:54.145
Hey, Katie, it's Dad.
Are you okay?

11:54.147 --> 11:56.147
Dad, there's a bat flying around
in Emme's room

11:56.149 --> 11:57.482
and she's
freaking out.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.017
How did a bat get in the house?

11:59.019 --> 12:00.151
It must have flown in when you

12:00.153 --> 12:02.087
left the back door open
to fix the fuse.

12:02.089 --> 12:04.789
Okay, no need to point fingers.

12:04.791 --> 12:06.825
All right,
I-I'll be home in a minute.

12:06.827 --> 12:09.761
Okay, listen,
tell Andi, uh...

12:09.763 --> 12:12.230
I'll make something up.
No, no, no, no, no.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.432
Uh, tell her, uh,
tell her I had to move the car.

12:14.434 --> 12:16.501
I-I accidently parked
in a loading zone.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.937
Okay, but I got to find a
strong drink for Marcy first.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.505
She's starting to
get suspicious.

12:20.507 --> 12:22.240
Really?

12:22.241 --> 12:23.974
You having a hard time
outsmarting her, are you?

12:23.977 --> 12:25.009
Oh, always.

12:25.011 --> 12:26.311
Huh.

12:26.313 --> 12:27.979
Oh, this drink looks good.

12:27.981 --> 12:30.014
It's called a Mind Eraser.

12:31.418 --> 12:34.018
Yeah. Mom must've
had a few of those

12:34.020 --> 12:36.087
when she was pregnant with you.

12:37.023 --> 12:39.124
Okay! I'm here.

12:39.126 --> 12:40.859
I'm here!

12:40.861 --> 12:41.826
Hello?

12:41.828 --> 12:42.961
Oh, it's okay,

12:42.963 --> 12:44.829
I got him to fly
out the window.

12:44.831 --> 12:47.465
Really?
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.067
You're the best babysitter ever.

12:49.069 --> 12:50.068
See that?

12:50.070 --> 12:51.035
Nothing to be scared of.

12:51.037 --> 12:52.771
Just a little bat.
(chuckles)

12:55.075 --> 12:56.875
Ah! The bat's out here!

12:57.978 --> 12:59.511
It's chasing me!

13:02.149 --> 13:04.082
(phone buzzing)

13:04.084 --> 13:06.217
Not again.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.319
Hey, Katie.
What is it this time?

13:08.321 --> 13:10.822
Never mind, I'm coming.

13:10.824 --> 13:12.257
Hey, pal.

13:12.259 --> 13:14.292
Hi, Dad.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.963
Okay, ready?

13:18.965 --> 13:20.098
Yeah.
Out you go.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.266
(both grunt)

13:21.268 --> 13:24.803
(whoops)
What a rush.

13:24.805 --> 13:26.037
Yeah, it's good, right?

13:26.039 --> 13:27.505
Yeah.
Yeah. Okay,

13:27.506 --> 13:28.972
please don't do that again,
all right?

13:28.973 --> 13:30.439
All right, I got to go.
You call me if you need me.

13:30.443 --> 13:31.442
(door closes)

13:31.444 --> 13:33.978
(phone rings)

13:33.980 --> 13:35.980
Hey, Mom.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.348
Hey, honey, just checking in.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.184
Oh, uh, don't worry,
Dad just left.

13:39.186 --> 13:42.453
Wait, your-your dad was there?

13:42.455 --> 13:45.423
Yeah, to get Teddy's head
out of the banister.

13:45.425 --> 13:46.958
What?

13:46.960 --> 13:48.493
(stammering):
Kate, what happened?

13:48.495 --> 13:49.961
Which time?

13:49.963 --> 13:52.463
"Which time?"

13:52.465 --> 13:54.432
Oh, it... it's no big deal.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.267
Dad only came home
when the fuse blew out,

13:56.269 --> 13:58.369
when the bat was upstairs
and when Teddy's head got stuck.

14:00.607 --> 14:02.307
I thought you guys
told each other stuff.

14:02.309 --> 14:04.309
Yeah, so did I.

14:05.245 --> 14:06.277
Okay, honey, well, I think

14:06.279 --> 14:07.879
we'll be home very soon.

14:07.881 --> 14:10.081
Okay? Bye-bye.

14:10.083 --> 14:12.050
Excuse me?

14:12.052 --> 14:14.953
I would like your most expensive
bottle of wine, please.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.294
This drink is delicious.
I don't even care

14:23.296 --> 14:25.530
if my name's not on the glass.

14:25.532 --> 14:26.965
(chuckles)
There you go.

14:26.966 --> 14:28.399
And there's hardly
any alcohol in there,

14:28.401 --> 14:30.134
so you could have
as many as you want.

14:31.605 --> 14:33.638
Hey.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.607
ANDI:
Hey.

14:35.609 --> 14:38.409
Honey, it sure took you
a long time to move the car.

14:38.411 --> 14:41.145
Yeah, well,
I had to circle around forever.

14:41.147 --> 14:43.114
Practically ended up
back at the house.

14:43.116 --> 14:44.883
(Adam and Andi laugh)

14:44.885 --> 14:47.151
I hate when
I can't find a parking spot.

14:47.153 --> 14:49.888
It just makes me
want to blow a fuse.

14:51.625 --> 14:55.326
Well, that... that was very
specifically worded.

14:55.328 --> 14:58.196
It just drives me...
(groans)

14:58.198 --> 14:59.631
batty.

15:00.667 --> 15:03.968
It's over, man.

15:05.906 --> 15:07.939
Why didn't you tell me you
had to go home three times?

15:07.941 --> 15:09.207
I'm sorry.

15:09.209 --> 15:11.409
I wasn't thinking straight
because I got caught up

15:11.411 --> 15:13.945
in this beautiful
fantasy.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.680
Imagine this:
it's a typical night,

15:15.682 --> 15:17.949
the kids are tired and fighting,

15:17.951 --> 15:19.384
and what do we do?

15:19.386 --> 15:21.185
We just walk out the door.

15:22.923 --> 15:24.355
Because the babysitter
is already there.

15:25.926 --> 15:28.960
All right, I mean,
that does sound pretty good.

15:28.962 --> 15:30.962
And Katie did the right thing:
every time there was a problem,

15:30.964 --> 15:32.196
she called me.

15:32.198 --> 15:33.598
We can trust her.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.934
'Cause she was raised
by a good mother.

15:35.936 --> 15:38.136
A good, smokin' hot mother.

15:38.138 --> 15:39.604
Okay, okay.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.606
Too much?

15:41.608 --> 15:43.975
No, I mean, I like it.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.711
I like the fantasy,

15:46.713 --> 15:48.947
I-I like the whole thing.

15:48.949 --> 15:50.548
Yeah.
You know what?
I'm gonna call Katie

15:50.550 --> 15:52.317
and tell her what a good job
she's doing.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.385
Great, great.
Then let's go enjoy our night.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.587
We still got a lot to look
forward to: dinner, dancing,

15:56.589 --> 15:59.624
fireworks when Don's night
goes up in flames.

16:01.962 --> 16:03.428
Adam, she's not picking up.

16:03.430 --> 16:06.464
What?

16:06.465 --> 16:09.499
(blender whirring)
(phone ringing)

16:09.502 --> 16:11.669
This night is going great.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.738
I think I'm actually
gonna get away with it.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.724
Hey, bartender,

16:15.725 --> 16:17.709
another Mind Eraser,
shaky, shaky.

16:17.711 --> 16:19.644
Five rings,

16:19.646 --> 16:22.347
six rings... voice mail.

16:22.349 --> 16:24.649
Voice mail, Adam!
Well, why isn't she answering?

16:24.651 --> 16:26.551
I don't know, but we need to
get home to our kids right now!

16:26.553 --> 16:27.685
All right, all right, that's it,

16:27.687 --> 16:28.653
we're out of here.

16:28.655 --> 16:29.654
Oh!

16:29.656 --> 16:31.022
Oh...

16:31.024 --> 16:31.656
Oh, sorry, buddy.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.424
Uh, he'll pay for it.

16:33.426 --> 16:35.526
I-I got to go!

16:35.528 --> 16:37.362
Why do I have to pay for it?

16:37.364 --> 16:38.730
It wasn't even my reservation!

16:41.434 --> 16:43.267
What did you just say?

16:44.671 --> 16:47.739
(sighs)
Oh, I was so close.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.042
Still no answer.

16:51.044 --> 16:52.510
Can you drive faster?

16:52.512 --> 16:53.711
Well, I...
(scoffs)
My God,

16:53.713 --> 16:54.712
when we're going
for fried chicken,

16:54.714 --> 16:56.347
you're breaking
the sound barrier.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.182
All right, hold on.

16:58.184 --> 17:01.252
(siren chirps)

17:01.254 --> 17:03.688
Oh, you got to
be kidding me!

17:03.690 --> 17:07.091
(groans)

17:07.093 --> 17:08.626
I'm soaked in booze.

17:08.628 --> 17:10.261
He's gonna think
I've been drinking.

17:10.263 --> 17:12.363
You got any perfume
or something to cover the smell?

17:12.365 --> 17:14.499
Uh... ooh, this'll work.

17:14.501 --> 17:15.600
This'll work, okay.

17:15.602 --> 17:17.535
Ow! What the
hell was that?

17:17.537 --> 17:19.103
It's-it's lavender hair spray,

17:19.105 --> 17:20.772
with-with a little bit
of glitter.

17:20.774 --> 17:23.074
(Adam gags)
It's why I look
like a princess tonight.

17:24.778 --> 17:27.078
It's in my eyes!

17:27.080 --> 17:28.112
Okay, uh...

17:28.114 --> 17:30.114
Give me something
to wipe my eyes.

17:30.116 --> 17:32.050
I don't...
I don't have anything.

17:32.052 --> 17:33.818
I... here, oh, here.
(groans)

17:33.820 --> 17:36.087
Use my dress.
Okay.

17:36.089 --> 17:38.656
Oh...

17:38.658 --> 17:41.359
(knock on window)

17:45.698 --> 17:47.799
Good evening, officer.

17:47.801 --> 17:50.635
Well, I pulled you over
for doing 50 in a 35,

17:50.637 --> 17:53.738
but by the look of things, we
have a bit more to talk about.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.840
Oh...

17:55.842 --> 17:58.576
Doesn't he look
like a princess?

17:59.746 --> 18:01.479
(knock on door)

18:14.794 --> 18:16.427
Are these your parents?

18:16.429 --> 18:18.529
(sighs)
I'm afraid so.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.535
What do you two have to say
for yourselves?

18:26.606 --> 18:27.772
I'm sorry, honey.

18:27.774 --> 18:30.108
Oh, sure,
apologize to her.

18:30.110 --> 18:31.476
My eyes got glittered,

18:31.478 --> 18:34.345
it's like I'm living
in a snow globe.

18:34.347 --> 18:37.281
Look, me babysitting
isn't gonna work

18:37.283 --> 18:39.217
if you can't be
more responsible.

18:41.121 --> 18:42.286
You're right.

18:42.288 --> 18:44.422
Yeah.
(mumbles)

18:44.424 --> 18:45.556
What was that?

18:46.526 --> 18:50.761
You're right. God.

18:50.763 --> 18:51.829
Now...

18:51.831 --> 18:53.698
I'm gonna put
these two to bed.

18:53.700 --> 18:56.334
Just know, I'm not mad.

18:56.336 --> 18:57.668
I'm disappointed.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.906
We're all
disappointed.

19:04.611 --> 19:07.178
(scoffs)

19:07.180 --> 19:10.581
Well, clearly Kate's
bossy enough to babysit.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.750
I'm sorry, honey.

19:12.752 --> 19:15.186
I really wanted this
to be a special night for you.

19:15.188 --> 19:17.855
Well, I mean, you know,
we got covered in drinks,

19:17.857 --> 19:20.391
covered in glitter and
detained by the police.

19:20.393 --> 19:24.295
Before we had kids, we would've
called that a pretty fun night.

19:24.297 --> 19:26.364
Yeah.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.466
And it's not over yet.

19:28.468 --> 19:30.935
I still have one more
Valentine's Day gift for you.

19:31.704 --> 19:33.304
But I have to give it
to you upstairs.

19:33.306 --> 19:36.307
Oh, so the same thing
you got me last year?

19:38.278 --> 19:40.178
Well, it might be
in a different order,

19:40.180 --> 19:41.812
but we end up
in the same place.

19:41.814 --> 19:44.215
All right, let's go.

19:44.217 --> 19:45.883
(Adam chuckles)

19:45.885 --> 19:47.485
(knock on door)

19:50.557 --> 19:52.657
(groans)

19:58.932 --> 20:01.732
Turns out Mind Erasers wear off.

20:03.303 --> 20:06.971
Get in here,
you big howler monkey.

20:14.514 --> 20:16.347
Okay, Kate, we're headed out.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.683
Now remember,
doors are still death

20:18.685 --> 20:20.651
and try to keep Teddy's head
out of the banister.

20:20.653 --> 20:21.953
I know he's quick.

20:21.955 --> 20:24.455
And, uh, call us
if you need anything.

20:24.457 --> 20:26.390
Same deal as before,
three dollars an hour.

20:26.926 --> 20:29.527
I'm thinking ten.

20:29.529 --> 20:32.263
What?
When did the price go up?

20:32.265 --> 20:35.499
When you bought
non-refundable movie tickets.

20:37.003 --> 20:39.370
Now that's how you negotiate.
