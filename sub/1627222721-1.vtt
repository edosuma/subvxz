WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.211
What is happening?

00:03.294 --> 00:05.630
-What is it that you all have in common?
-<i>We're all alone.</i>

00:05.714 --> 00:07.298
My father ran away
and left me when I was three.

00:07.382 --> 00:09.050
We're asking you to go on a mission.

00:09.134 --> 00:11.302
A risky, an undercover mission,
and unfortunately,

00:11.386 --> 00:13.263
one that can only be accomplished
by children.

00:13.346 --> 00:16.558
Hidden messages. They're coming
from the Institute on Harbor Island.

00:16.641 --> 00:20.020
You four are going to infiltrate
the institute as my secret agents.

00:20.103 --> 00:22.272
What makes you think
that four kids can stop all of this?

00:22.355 --> 00:23.440
Not just kids.

00:24.399 --> 00:26.276
<i>Four extraordinary kids.</i>

00:26.359 --> 00:29.529
CONSTANCE:
<i>The Mysterious Benedict Society.</i>

00:29.612 --> 00:30.739
L.D. CURTAIN: Welcome, new students.

00:30.822 --> 00:32.782
I'm your headmaster, Dr. L.D. Curtain.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.534
<i>L.D. Curtain is your brother.</i>

00:34.659 --> 00:36.578
-He's the man we've been hunting.
-Yes.

00:36.661 --> 00:39.247
L.D. CURTAIN: This gallery contains
my most prized invention.

00:39.330 --> 00:41.583
-The Whisperer.
-Textbook mind control.

00:41.666 --> 00:44.169
Not just of Stonetown, of the whole world.

00:44.252 --> 00:46.296
-Goodbye, free will.
-It's go time.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.673
Yes, Kate. We're going to raid the tower.

00:50.091 --> 00:51.468
L.D. CURTAIN:
Security to the Whispering Room.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.053
-Code Red.
-<i>All available security--</i>

00:53.136 --> 00:56.598
I am not some damaged person
in need of self-healing!

00:56.681 --> 00:57.640
Or some...

00:59.017 --> 01:01.227
-He's gonna wake up any second.
-And he called for help.

01:01.311 --> 01:04.064
-What are you doing?
-All that is left is to break its will.

01:04.147 --> 01:05.106
It's a machine.

01:05.190 --> 01:06.941
THE WHISPERER:
<i>Why can't you just go along?</i>

01:07.025 --> 01:08.318
Yes!

01:10.195 --> 01:12.030
Whoa, she did it.

01:12.947 --> 01:13.990
L.D. CURTAIN: <i>This is Curtain.</i>

01:14.074 --> 01:16.534
Stand down. The Emergency is over.

01:17.285 --> 01:19.245
What does it feel like? Having no memory.

01:19.329 --> 01:20.830
It felt like searching.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.499
For the answer in front of me.

01:22.582 --> 01:23.833
It was you, Kate.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.418
It was always you.

01:25.794 --> 01:28.630
-I am so proud of you.
-I want to come live with you.

01:28.713 --> 01:30.090
I've been thinking about that, too.

01:30.173 --> 01:32.884
Have you given any thought
to your continued studies?

01:32.967 --> 01:34.803
I was hoping to go
to the Boatwright Academy.

01:34.886 --> 01:36.429
Oh, you richly deserve that.

01:36.513 --> 01:37.722
You'll be valued there.

01:37.806 --> 01:39.891
-Constance.
-Respectfully decline.

01:39.974 --> 01:41.142
-Decline?
-The adoption.

01:41.226 --> 01:43.937
I will stay here,
but let's not paper this.

01:44.020 --> 01:46.272
-<i>What are you going to do?</i>
-<i>I'm going to find him.</i>

01:46.356 --> 01:47.690
<i>I won't give up on him.</i>

01:48.399 --> 01:50.819
-Whisperer is just a souvenir.
-Really?

01:50.902 --> 01:52.070
I've got something better.

01:55.740 --> 01:57.617
Well, this could be interesting.

02:05.542 --> 02:07.502
<i>My dear Society,</i>

02:08.711 --> 02:10.547
<i>in the years
since we've all been together,</i>

02:10.630 --> 02:13.925
<i>life has taken some surprising turns,
hasn't it?</i>

02:15.969 --> 02:20.181
<i>Out of nowhere,
we find ourselves in unexpected places.</i>

02:21.141 --> 02:22.350
Seven seconds.

02:22.934 --> 02:25.562
How is yours so much faster?

02:25.687 --> 02:28.189
I just crafted
a plant-based dietary supplement

02:28.273 --> 02:30.275
that increased her mitochondrial function.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.741
<i>With amazing new people
experiencing things</i>

02:38.825 --> 02:41.286
<i>we never imagined possible.</i>

02:44.080 --> 02:49.711
<i>Or in the everyday surprise
of that elusive state known as harmony.</i>

03:02.682 --> 03:05.059
<i>Yes, there is joy in the unexpected.</i>

03:06.978 --> 03:08.897
<i>It can make life more colorful.</i>

03:10.940 --> 03:12.108
<i>More exciting.</i>

03:16.613 --> 03:17.655
Innovative.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.408
Not efficient.

03:21.618 --> 03:24.078
-I'll trade time for fun.
-That's a good bargain.

03:24.829 --> 03:25.830
-Madge.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.250
What you got there?

03:35.798 --> 03:36.841
<i>But...</i>

03:37.717 --> 03:40.511
<i>not all surprises are good.</i>

03:40.595 --> 03:44.515
<i>Smooth sailing
can suddenly become rough waters.</i>

03:44.599 --> 03:48.228
<i>That's why it is so important
that we have each other.</i>

03:48.311 --> 03:52.690
<i>And that's why I invite you all
on a new adventure.</i>

03:52.774 --> 03:54.108
<i>We're family.</i>

03:54.192 --> 03:57.820
<i>And though everyday life
might send us in different directions,</i>

03:57.904 --> 04:00.365
<i>when we encounter these squalls,</i>

04:00.448 --> 04:06.079
<i>it is time for this family to regroup.</i>

05:05.888 --> 05:08.891
<i>Our esteemed guest
is Dr. L.D. Curtain.</i>

05:08.975 --> 05:10.059
<i>That's me.</i>

05:10.143 --> 05:13.354
<i>Do people just stop you
on the street and say thank you?</i>

05:13.438 --> 05:15.398
<i>Now, why would they do that?</i>

05:15.481 --> 05:18.901
<i>Perhaps because you single handedly
solved The Emergency?</i>

05:18.985 --> 05:21.070
<i>One of the greatest crises
of our lifetime.</i>

05:21.154 --> 05:23.156
<i>-Yeah.
-People call you a hero.</i>

05:23.239 --> 05:24.949
<i>Oh, no, no, no.</i>

05:25.033 --> 05:27.160
<i>I'm just a simple man.</i>

05:27.243 --> 05:30.163
<i>Well, I am a man who saw a problem</i>

05:30.246 --> 05:33.499
<i>and sniffed out
the rogue scientist responsible.</i>

05:33.583 --> 05:35.293
-Dr. Garrison.
-Yes.

05:35.960 --> 05:38.254
Do you feel personally betrayed?

05:38.338 --> 05:40.882
Of course, I do. I do.

05:40.965 --> 05:43.092
But this isn't about me. I'm just...

05:43.176 --> 05:46.137
I'm just thankful
that I had the unique intellect

05:46.220 --> 05:47.638
and know how to solve the problem.

05:48.806 --> 05:50.016
For everyone.

05:50.099 --> 05:54.479
-And now your latest venture, Happiness.
-Happiness.

05:54.562 --> 05:56.856
Lectures, television specials,

05:56.939 --> 05:58.149
-a new book.
-Um-hm.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.943
You've become a guru of sorts.

06:01.027 --> 06:03.738
Ridding the world of sadness,
one person at a time.

06:03.821 --> 06:06.699
-Yes.
-They say you can make anyone happy.

06:07.867 --> 06:10.536
I can't control what they're saying,
but yes.

06:11.454 --> 06:12.455
I can.

06:13.331 --> 06:14.999
Oh, a raised eyebrow.

06:15.083 --> 06:16.417
Don't you want to be happy?

06:16.918 --> 06:18.169
All the time?

06:19.170 --> 06:21.631
Aren't the ups and downs
what makes us human?

06:21.714 --> 06:23.758
No. I think that's your inner naysayer.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.094
Why not choose happiness?

06:27.303 --> 06:28.471
Let me ask you.

06:32.642 --> 06:34.060
Did you know you deserve it, Hannah?

06:35.645 --> 06:40.108
Did you know you can opt-in to joy
and good feeling?

06:41.859 --> 06:44.195
With me, that's possible.

06:45.154 --> 06:46.364
Choose...

06:47.865 --> 06:49.117
happiness.

06:53.204 --> 06:54.288
What is it?

06:55.957 --> 06:59.919
I'm certainly feeling an overwhelming
sense of well-being.

07:04.048 --> 07:05.633
Isn't it wonderful?

07:13.975 --> 07:15.893
Come, have breakfast.

07:16.811 --> 07:17.937
I'm not hungry.

07:19.647 --> 07:23.276
You say that before you have tried
my Dutch baby.

07:24.402 --> 07:25.403
Babies.

07:25.486 --> 07:28.448
Three, two, one.

07:35.204 --> 07:38.082
Who is this? Where's Rhonda?

07:38.166 --> 07:41.377
My friend, you should know better by now.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.422
I do. I was just working
on a character of my own.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.717
-Global traveler.
-Very convincing.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.886
-How are you?
-Doing real good.

07:49.969 --> 07:53.264
The clues are demanding, but fair.
The children are going to love it.

07:53.347 --> 07:55.308
Oh, I'm so excited to see you.

07:55.391 --> 07:58.519
Hey, we have unfinished business.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.647
<i>The Stonetown loggers
establishing a smooth rhythm,</i>

08:01.731 --> 08:03.774
<i>but it's no match
for long Norwegian power.</i>

08:03.858 --> 08:06.486
<i>And the win goes to the team from Bergen.</i>

08:06.569 --> 08:09.489
No!

08:09.572 --> 08:13.201
The Euro Cup is in Antwerp this year.
We'll get redemption there.

08:13.284 --> 08:14.994
Ah, so that's where you are.

08:15.077 --> 08:16.412
<i>-Antwerp.</i>

08:16.496 --> 08:18.831
Nice try. You know I can't tell you that.

08:18.915 --> 08:21.292
-How's Mr. Benedict?
-Hmm.

08:21.375 --> 08:26.005
Irritable, annoying at times,
just irritable at others.

08:27.298 --> 08:30.092
He's still hung up on the injustice.

08:30.176 --> 08:33.554
I think the scavenger hunt is just
as much for him as it is for the kids.

08:33.638 --> 08:36.432
Agreed. I just wish they... Oh, wait.

08:37.808 --> 08:40.520
Where is he going? Mr. Benedict?

08:42.647 --> 08:43.773
Hello?

08:43.856 --> 08:46.526
-Where are you going?
-Oh, to the train station.

08:46.609 --> 08:50.571
-We are going to a symposium.
-A symposium?

08:50.655 --> 08:51.948
Yes. Look.

08:53.115 --> 08:54.575
Are you even invited to speak?

08:54.659 --> 08:57.078
Well, I'm an esteemed scientist.
They'll...

08:57.161 --> 08:58.621
It's not an open mic.

08:59.288 --> 09:02.542
Well, as we wait for the children,
I thought we could use this time for good.

09:02.625 --> 09:05.253
Don't you think?
And, and the truth cannot wait any longer.

09:05.628 --> 09:07.380
No one wants to hear the truth.

09:08.839 --> 09:12.176
You tried this multiple times,
Mr. Benedict,

09:12.677 --> 09:14.220
and no one is interested.

09:14.303 --> 09:16.472
The important thing is that
The Emergency is over.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.432
Who cares that your brother
gets all the credit

09:18.516 --> 09:19.642
and you're mocked and seen as a downer?

09:19.725 --> 09:21.727
-Who's mocking me?
-It doesn't matter.

09:22.228 --> 09:24.814
People are back to their lives.
That's what matters.

09:24.897 --> 09:27.066
So, maybe just call it victory

09:27.149 --> 09:28.568
-and enjoy it?

09:28.651 --> 09:32.405
No one is safe with my brother
as some guru

09:32.488 --> 09:34.949
with all this influence. This is...

09:36.075 --> 09:37.910
We seem pretty safe.

09:37.994 --> 09:41.747
-Hey, it's okay to be jealous of him.

09:41.831 --> 09:44.500
-None of this is fair.
-Excuse me.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.502
The truth is important.

09:48.546 --> 09:52.300
It's not even a high level conference,
even the middle tier.

09:52.383 --> 09:54.802
I'm not jealous. Excuse me.

09:54.885 --> 09:56.178
Mr. Benedict!

09:58.055 --> 09:59.807
Excuse me.

09:59.890 --> 10:02.685
-Mr. Benedict.
-Excuse me. Out of the way.

10:02.768 --> 10:04.228
Mr. Benedict.

10:07.106 --> 10:09.859
Excuse me. Excuse me. Mr. Benedict.

10:11.611 --> 10:12.612
Where...

10:13.362 --> 10:15.197
Mr. Benedict.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.034
Mr. Benedict?

10:19.410 --> 10:20.870
Mr. Benedict?

10:21.621 --> 10:22.997
Hey!

10:32.006 --> 10:34.091
It says to pack for an adventure,

10:34.175 --> 10:36.093
maybe a few extra clothes.

10:36.177 --> 10:38.304
Anything I need,
it's in my bucket or can be gotten

10:38.387 --> 10:40.014
with the things in my bucket
and carried in my bucket.

10:40.097 --> 10:43.059
I'll pack a tiny go bag or gorp.

10:43.142 --> 10:44.810
-That's not necessary.
-What about...

10:46.062 --> 10:46.937
this?

10:47.021 --> 10:48.314
It's a multi tool.

10:48.397 --> 10:50.816
I whittled it for the bucket.

10:51.609 --> 10:55.321
Oh, that's really nice,
but I don't have a room...

10:55.404 --> 10:57.073
You fit a winch in there.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.867
I can take care of myself.

10:59.950 --> 11:03.788
I know you can, Kitty Cat,
but it's my job to take care of you also.

11:04.664 --> 11:05.831
Additionally.

11:11.128 --> 11:12.338
We should go.

11:18.302 --> 11:20.596
What if I got my own bucket?

11:20.680 --> 11:22.598
A pail, perhaps?

11:24.308 --> 11:25.559
That'd be cool.

11:32.024 --> 11:33.943
We've got plans this summer.

11:34.026 --> 11:37.655
We're going to send a grapefruit
into low Earth orbit.

11:37.738 --> 11:39.657
That sounds amazing.

11:40.032 --> 11:42.702
Please come.
We could use you on heat shields.

11:42.785 --> 11:44.370
I'd really love to,

11:44.453 --> 11:46.706
but I have this reunion thing
I have to go to.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.833
Oh, I'm sure that'll be great too.

11:53.838 --> 11:55.131
Ready to go?

11:56.424 --> 11:58.592
Sure. But it's almost 11:00.

11:59.510 --> 12:02.471
Oh, the postman. Yes, he is punctual.

12:02.888 --> 12:04.890
I just wrote Sticky so many letters.

12:05.975 --> 12:08.477
There must be some backlog
or forwarding issue.

12:09.103 --> 12:10.771
This could be the day the dam breaks.

12:10.855 --> 12:13.899
You're going to see him really soon.
You're going to see all of them.

12:17.486 --> 12:20.573
I wonder if you're nervous
to see them again,

12:21.282 --> 12:22.742
if it'll be the same?

12:25.745 --> 12:28.205
People like to communicate
in different ways.

12:29.373 --> 12:31.625
Sometimes it's as simple as that.

12:31.709 --> 12:34.503
Besides,
no matter how much time has passed,

12:35.504 --> 12:38.841
they know you and they care about you.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.718
And that won't change.

12:41.552 --> 12:43.971
But still, we can wait.

12:53.105 --> 12:54.565
Good to see you.

13:17.296 --> 13:18.506
You got everything?

13:18.589 --> 13:20.466
MS. PERUMAL: Have a great time, okay?

13:45.658 --> 13:47.743
Everyone looks gangly and weird.

13:49.203 --> 13:50.287
We've all grown.

13:50.371 --> 13:51.789
No. That's not it.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.295
Should we hug?

13:58.379 --> 14:00.422
-Uh...
-Don't be repulsive.

14:01.882 --> 14:03.926
We got to mark the occasion.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.013
Okay. We're back.

14:09.014 --> 14:11.809
Elephant in the room.
Constance killed a machine with her mind.

14:12.476 --> 14:13.811
Yeah, I've got questions.

14:14.478 --> 14:16.605
Me too. Let's go inside.

14:18.148 --> 14:19.733
Is it really been a year?

14:22.111 --> 14:24.780
by Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel)

14:55.311 --> 14:58.105
-Dog man?
-Gather the kids.

15:00.858 --> 15:03.110
It's so nice to see you, truly.

15:03.569 --> 15:06.614
This was supposed to be a joyous occasion.

15:07.990 --> 15:10.576
-But?
-Mr. Benedict and Number Two...

15:11.452 --> 15:12.453
are missing.

15:13.579 --> 15:14.830
What do you mean?

15:14.914 --> 15:18.125
-Her sentence seemed pretty clear.
-How? What happened?

15:18.208 --> 15:20.920
Benedict and Number Two
have been traveling across Europe,

15:21.003 --> 15:24.882
planting clues for a scavenger hunt,
which would lead us all to a big reunion.

15:24.965 --> 15:26.050
Fun!

15:27.051 --> 15:28.719
What? It sounds like fun.

15:28.802 --> 15:31.180
They just missed
their second compulsory check in.

15:31.263 --> 15:33.724
-I don't...
-It's a foolproof, fail-safe system

15:33.807 --> 15:35.309
we enact for security abroad.

15:35.392 --> 15:38.854
And you know, Number Two.
Missing it once, never.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.023
Twice? Unthinkable.

15:41.106 --> 15:44.693
-They've gone silent. They've disappeared.
-What do we do?

15:44.777 --> 15:47.655
Milligan and I need to put all our efforts
into finding them.

15:47.738 --> 15:50.824
And of course, the scavenger hunt is off.

15:51.575 --> 15:52.952
I'm very sorry.

15:55.204 --> 15:56.080
Thank you, François.

15:56.163 --> 15:57.998
Anything you can
tell me could be interesting.

15:58.082 --> 16:00.209
Unfortunately,
we haven't found anything either.

16:00.292 --> 16:03.587
The trail went cold
and time is of the essence...

16:06.173 --> 16:07.925
So, when do we leave for Europe?

16:08.759 --> 16:11.136
We want to be part of the search.
I know we can help.

16:11.220 --> 16:13.889
-I'm sorry, Reynie, but no.
-Thank you.

16:14.932 --> 16:15.766
No.

16:15.849 --> 16:18.477
I understand it emotionally,
but it's unrealistic.

16:18.560 --> 16:19.853
Potentially counterproductive.

16:19.937 --> 16:20.813
Dangerous.

16:20.896 --> 16:25.693
I was saving that for last,
but yes, it could be very dangerous.

16:25.776 --> 16:28.070
Too many unknowns. It's a no.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.490
A firm no.

16:32.658 --> 16:33.867
I'm very sorry.

16:33.951 --> 16:36.453
I've called Ms. Perumal
and the Boatwright Academy.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.247
You'll all be taken home very shortly.

16:46.588 --> 16:49.216
It's hard, I know. But...

16:50.175 --> 16:51.552
we'll take care of it.

16:51.635 --> 16:54.096
We'll find them, yeah?

16:56.682 --> 16:58.767
I don't understand. We should be going.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.811
Why are they leaving us
in other people's hands?

17:00.894 --> 17:03.355
They're just being logical and safe.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.941
We don't know where they are
or what happened.

17:06.025 --> 17:09.319
We do unsafe things all the time.
That's our signature.

17:09.778 --> 17:13.198
Anybody wants to see the first clue
to our canceled scavenger hunt?

17:13.282 --> 17:16.035
-I lifted it from Rhonda.
-Why?

17:16.118 --> 17:18.662
If I give you a reason,
will it comfort you?

17:19.413 --> 17:22.082
-Maybe.
-Mr. Benedict is gone.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.835
Maybe down a well, maybe into a propeller.

17:25.419 --> 17:27.337
Either way,
we will not be seeing him again.

17:27.421 --> 17:28.255
Constance.

17:28.338 --> 17:30.299
He would want us to go
on a scavenger hunt.

17:30.382 --> 17:33.510
Perhaps as his final gift to us.
His legacy.

17:34.678 --> 17:36.180
Come on, Reynie.

17:36.263 --> 17:38.557
Maybe the prize is a new sweater vest.

17:40.267 --> 17:44.563
No, the prize is a reunion with him.

17:44.646 --> 17:47.524
He made us a set of clues
to lead us to where he is.

17:47.608 --> 17:48.567
Where he was.

17:48.650 --> 17:51.612
We can use these clues to get to Europe
and find Mr. Benedict.

17:52.154 --> 17:54.073
Or at least find the well.

17:54.156 --> 17:56.450
This will get us close
to the last point of contact.

17:56.533 --> 17:57.910
We'll pick up the scent from there.

17:57.993 --> 18:01.246
Rhonda and Mulligan will never let us.
You heard them. Too dangerous.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.332
-Then I'm in.
-Me too.

18:03.415 --> 18:05.918
I crave the frontiers of human experience.

18:06.001 --> 18:08.670
They told us we're capable
of doing anything.

18:09.588 --> 18:11.673
And you know what we've done
and who we are.

18:12.299 --> 18:14.885
We're the mysterious Benedict Society.

18:15.302 --> 18:16.637
So let's go after them.

18:18.472 --> 18:19.473
What's the first clue?

18:23.352 --> 18:25.813
"Looking for something? Open me.

18:25.896 --> 18:28.148
I'm sure that your something
inside of me lies."

18:34.988 --> 18:38.117
Rhyming is the lowest form
of poetic expression.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.369
"What is sought, depends on the seeker."

18:43.539 --> 18:46.250
"Others for nature.
Still others for nurture."

18:58.095 --> 19:01.140
That's it? It's impossible.

19:01.223 --> 19:02.558
Nothing can hold all those things.

19:02.641 --> 19:05.185
And that's coming from someone
with the magic bucket.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.984
-Where are you going?
-The library.

19:21.451 --> 19:22.870
Driver?

19:23.996 --> 19:25.247
Driver?

19:28.542 --> 19:31.211
-Might as well be a mannequin.
-Just implacable.

19:31.295 --> 19:32.838
Excuse me.

19:33.964 --> 19:35.090
Driver.

19:35.799 --> 19:38.177
Driver!

19:41.471 --> 19:43.682
-Oh, oh.
-Hm?

19:50.397 --> 19:51.690
-Pork rillette?
-No.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.153
Hm.

19:56.236 --> 19:59.364
Well, at least the provisions are good
for our kidnapping.

19:59.865 --> 20:02.451
Yes, yes, yes.

20:02.534 --> 20:05.829
Why be so thoughtfully curated
if we were meant harm?

20:07.039 --> 20:09.750
Well, many sociopaths
are unfailingly polite.

20:09.833 --> 20:13.587
Well, this could easily be a benefactor,
a powerful benefactor.

20:13.670 --> 20:18.175
But yes, someone who wants to help. Yes.

20:27.267 --> 20:30.938
The dictionary, of course.
It's alphabetized.

20:31.021 --> 20:33.315
"Hope comes after despair,
but before surprise."

20:33.398 --> 20:35.651
And, "What I mean lies inside of me too."

20:35.734 --> 20:39.196
-The definition for dictionaries...
-In the dictionary.

20:39.488 --> 20:40.948
But which dictionary?

20:41.031 --> 20:42.616
Benedict's kind of obsessed with them.

20:42.699 --> 20:45.661
There are 17 in the house,
28 if you count foreign languages.

20:47.496 --> 20:48.956
Last time I checked.

20:49.039 --> 20:51.124
A lot has happened since you left, George.

20:51.208 --> 20:52.918
Many dictionaries acquired.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.879
With that many, we need to split up.

20:55.963 --> 20:58.799
-Sticky, library. You guys--
-Benedict's study.

21:03.720 --> 21:06.265
Dictionary, dictionary...

21:07.099 --> 21:09.476
I've never understood his shelving system.

21:09.935 --> 21:11.520
There is no system.

21:12.562 --> 21:15.315
I'm sure the library at Boatwright
is crazy organized.

21:16.149 --> 21:18.527
It is. Pretty much everything is.

21:19.778 --> 21:20.862
I imagine.

21:21.697 --> 21:26.201
How are things, like, I don't know,
the mail delivery situation?

21:27.035 --> 21:29.788
Mail delivery? Just a random example.

21:30.372 --> 21:34.084
-How does that work?
-We just go down to the P.O.

21:34.459 --> 21:37.254
Everybody has a mailbox. Nothing special.

21:38.505 --> 21:40.966
Though it's kind of funny.

21:41.049 --> 21:43.302
They have these tables
where student clubs set up.

21:43.385 --> 21:44.803
Rocketry, debate, you know?

21:44.886 --> 21:47.264
-One day, doing the Bees.
-The Bees?

21:47.347 --> 21:48.890
The Bees, Brady Beesley?

21:49.474 --> 21:51.435
Anyway, they dressed up in all black,

21:51.518 --> 21:54.730
set up a table with a blank black sign
and blank nametags.

21:54.813 --> 21:57.691
Nothingness Club.
They got, like, 25 people to sign up.

21:57.774 --> 22:00.152
-It was hilarious.
-Cool.

22:00.235 --> 22:03.864
So anyway, seems like
the mail delivery system is in good shape.

22:04.990 --> 22:07.075
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

22:08.535 --> 22:10.537
But I've missed you.

22:10.954 --> 22:11.955
It's good to see you.

22:25.385 --> 22:28.930
-I want to know about rural life.
-Okay.

22:29.014 --> 22:32.309
-Do you milk a cow?
-On occasion.

22:32.726 --> 22:35.771
-Slop the hog pen?
-If called for.

22:35.854 --> 22:39.483
-Harvest?
-Only during harvest.

22:40.442 --> 22:43.111
What do you harvest? Loneliness?

22:44.071 --> 22:46.365
-It's definitely not lonely.
-Oh, yes.

22:46.448 --> 22:49.034
Just you and your father
against the world.

22:49.117 --> 22:51.036
-Kind of like you.
-Ha.

22:51.536 --> 22:53.955
What's it like, having Benedict for a dad?

22:54.039 --> 22:57.793
-Not dad, roommate.
-Okay.

22:57.876 --> 23:00.837
Respectful distance,
intelligent conversation.

23:01.463 --> 23:04.049
I allow him to believe he's good at chess.

23:04.132 --> 23:06.051
He brings me nutritious food.

23:06.593 --> 23:08.136
I don't even know what I'm looking for.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.639
-Finally, some truth.
-What?

23:11.223 --> 23:13.892
I was talking about the dictionaries.

23:16.478 --> 23:18.814
You can needle me all you want,
but you like me.

23:18.897 --> 23:20.190
You admitted it.

23:22.150 --> 23:23.151
Hello.

23:24.277 --> 23:25.487
What's going on?

23:26.279 --> 23:29.741
Just trying to increase my vocab.

23:30.700 --> 23:32.369
Not a lot of books on the farm.

23:32.452 --> 23:36.748
Oh, you'd like more books on the farm?
I'd be happy to place an order.

23:36.832 --> 23:40.001
I know that my collection skews heavily
towards historical thrillers.

23:40.085 --> 23:43.964
No, it's good. It's good.

23:47.801 --> 23:49.261
Okay, then.

23:52.639 --> 23:56.351
Nothing you need help with?
Nothing going on?

23:59.229 --> 24:00.439
Nope.

24:02.065 --> 24:03.483
I'll see you in a bit.

24:13.410 --> 24:14.619
Shut up.

24:18.248 --> 24:21.418
-Is there a dictionary in there?
-No. No, I'm just snooping.

24:25.755 --> 24:27.048
I found it.

24:32.304 --> 24:33.972
A book in a book.

24:40.228 --> 24:41.980
"Travelers should always keep journals.

24:42.063 --> 24:43.773
Journals should always keep secrets.

24:43.857 --> 24:45.650
Read quickly and move on.

24:46.234 --> 24:48.445
Bon voyage, Mr. Benedict."

24:49.279 --> 24:50.363
What's it say?

24:55.076 --> 24:58.705
This is... gibberish.

24:59.623 --> 25:04.794
Wait, the last word on each page
is in italics.

25:06.004 --> 25:09.549
"Take down roses

25:09.633 --> 25:16.431
and severely take your chances.

25:16.515 --> 25:19.267
Take up sewing...

25:19.351 --> 25:24.189
Take my... bait... answer...

25:24.272 --> 25:28.485
dogfish... shortcut...
learn the passage...

25:28.568 --> 25:32.113
cold cut, shortcut, uppercut."

25:35.408 --> 25:37.410
-That's it.
-Okay, then.

25:38.119 --> 25:40.455
-Very clear.
-What does it mean?

25:40.539 --> 25:42.958
Does anyone feel like
they've entered a trance?

25:43.959 --> 25:45.877
Maybe it's something structural.

25:45.961 --> 25:48.922
Uh, hidden compartment
within a hidden compartment?

25:49.464 --> 25:52.384
Structural. Yes. Give me that.

25:56.680 --> 25:58.431
-What are you doing?
-Constance.

25:58.515 --> 26:00.600
Pages with different sizes.
I've just separated them.

26:00.684 --> 26:03.270
It's called deckle edge.
It's a premium way to buy books.

26:03.353 --> 26:06.398
Mr. Benedict would never ask us
to desecrate a book.

26:06.481 --> 26:10.151
-Yeah, I feel unclean.
-Well, the clock's ticking.

26:10.235 --> 26:11.611
Better move quickly.

26:12.904 --> 26:15.740
We read it slowly.
He said to read quickly.

26:19.786 --> 26:23.456
"Take the shortcut."

26:23.540 --> 26:24.958
Take the shortcut.

26:28.128 --> 26:31.298
-What's the shortcut?
-It's a ship.

26:31.381 --> 26:33.717
-A ship?
-Not just a ship.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.343
It's the fastest ship in the world.

26:36.761 --> 26:38.680
I subscribe to <i>Maritime Monthly.</i>

26:38.763 --> 26:42.100
-George, as a young man, that is sad.
-What?

26:42.183 --> 26:44.519
It's an incredible window into the world.

26:44.603 --> 26:47.814
There's news, politics, opinion, recipes.

26:47.897 --> 26:52.611
The point is, Benedict knows
you love things nautical.

26:53.194 --> 26:54.946
Yeah, we've talked about it a lot.

26:55.030 --> 26:56.448
He knew you'd know.

27:01.036 --> 27:03.038
So, it's the ship.

27:03.705 --> 27:06.249
-Which is in port right now.
-How...

27:06.333 --> 27:07.584
In the nautical community,

27:07.667 --> 27:09.711
we always know the whereabouts
of the flagship class vessels.

27:09.794 --> 27:11.338
Everybody knows that, Kate.

27:11.713 --> 27:14.924
So if the idea was that we were supposed
to leave today...

27:15.008 --> 27:16.176
We better get to the harbor.

27:16.259 --> 27:18.803
Just go to the harbor? Then what?

27:21.056 --> 27:23.975
He'll have worked it out.
This was the plan.

27:24.059 --> 27:27.979
It will become clear. I have faith.

27:30.273 --> 27:33.276
So, are we really going to do this?

27:35.070 --> 27:36.363
We're gonna find them.

27:37.906 --> 27:39.783
But we all have to agree.

27:40.450 --> 27:42.118
Are we doing this?

27:48.541 --> 27:49.876
We're doing this.

28:02.180 --> 28:04.391
Hello, this is Rhonda. Yes?

28:41.344 --> 28:43.054
Respond, please!

28:43.138 --> 28:45.014
Your ride will be here soon.

28:52.188 --> 28:53.231
Milligan!

28:55.233 --> 28:58.653
<i>Sorry, we had to take matters
into our own hands.</i>

28:58.737 --> 29:01.364
<i>Don't worry. We'll be careful. Bon voyage.</i>

29:06.703 --> 29:07.662
MS. PERUMAL: What?

29:11.708 --> 29:13.585
<i>Last call for the SS Shortcut.</i>

29:13.668 --> 29:15.128
<i>All passengers aboard.</i>

29:15.211 --> 29:16.880
<i>Last call for the SS Shortcut.</i>

29:16.963 --> 29:18.089
Weatherall, Kate?

29:19.632 --> 29:20.925
Muldoon, Reynard?

29:21.843 --> 29:23.762
Is there another name they might be under?

29:23.845 --> 29:26.931
Try Mr. Nicholas Benedict.
They have to be here.

29:27.015 --> 29:29.684
As I told you, it's very rare
to have tickets left for pickup.

29:29.768 --> 29:33.062
<i>They would usually be
hand delivered and signed for.</i>

29:33.146 --> 29:34.481
<i>Hand delivered.</i>

29:34.773 --> 29:36.274
Almost without exception.

29:36.941 --> 29:39.944
Please, other people need service.

29:41.279 --> 29:43.615
-That was the second warning.
-Please.

29:43.698 --> 29:45.325
We're just, will calling a few more names.

29:45.408 --> 29:46.659
That's not a verb, sir.

29:46.743 --> 29:48.620
Rhonda Kazembe. Milligan?

29:48.703 --> 29:51.498
I'm sure you can understand
why you are losing credibility.

29:51.581 --> 29:54.083
And we do have very limited time.

29:54.167 --> 29:55.835
Next, please.

29:57.962 --> 30:00.006
Did not foresee being failed
by the ticket situation

30:00.089 --> 30:02.759
-before we even start.
-We need to think of something.

30:02.842 --> 30:05.637
This plan... it was naive at best.

30:06.805 --> 30:07.889
Where are you going?

30:09.349 --> 30:11.434
-We need to be on that boat.
-Ship.

30:11.518 --> 30:13.853
Call it a boat on board
and you'll get a stern reprimand.

30:14.646 --> 30:16.606
-Stern.
-What?

30:16.689 --> 30:20.026
-Oh, nice.
-Guys, I need ideas.

30:20.109 --> 30:23.279
If all this isn't a sign,
I don't know what is.

30:23.363 --> 30:24.656
They need us.

30:24.739 --> 30:26.574
Who knows
what danger they could be in?

31:36.519 --> 31:37.937
It's time, sir.

31:49.240 --> 31:51.576
Well, at least they've given us
a nice breakfast.

31:52.410 --> 31:54.162
How pleasant of him.

31:55.496 --> 31:56.497
Oh.

32:06.341 --> 32:08.468
Oh, him.

32:13.014 --> 32:16.267
Oh, so good to see you, brother.

32:18.019 --> 32:19.354
And your associate.

32:19.437 --> 32:21.522
I demand our immediate release.

32:22.315 --> 32:24.734
Release? From what?

32:25.610 --> 32:27.904
Well, don't limit your perspective,
Associate.

32:28.613 --> 32:29.489
Number Two.

32:30.156 --> 32:31.991
I'm not privy
to your organizational flow chart.

32:34.786 --> 32:36.996
-Why?
-Why what?

32:37.080 --> 32:38.790
Why are we here?

32:40.208 --> 32:43.252
Oh, I can't wait to share that with you.

32:44.671 --> 32:46.047
I know that you'll be...

32:47.924 --> 32:48.841
elated.

32:58.267 --> 33:00.520
Too late.

33:00.603 --> 33:03.064
-Bon voyage.
-Bon voyage.

33:04.524 --> 33:07.402
This is... a bit of a surprise.

33:08.486 --> 33:10.738
That's as eminently fair to say.

33:11.614 --> 33:12.865
This really isn't like Reynie.

33:13.616 --> 33:15.201
It's just like Kate.

33:15.284 --> 33:18.079
We told them there was nothing
they couldn't do.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.498
It's who we asked them to be.

33:21.916 --> 33:24.711
-Maybe...
-They believed us.
