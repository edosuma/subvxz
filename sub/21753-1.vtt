Hey, Chloe? Chloe?

11:55.815 --> 11:59.184
This is all because of you.

12:01.754 --> 12:03.154
[nervous laugh]

12:10.863 --> 12:14.399
I feel awful. I can't believe
what you told me over the phone.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.101
How did this happen?

12:16.103 --> 12:18.269
I spent ten years trying

12:18.271 --> 12:21.339
and in six months he's getting
married to someone else.

12:21.341 --> 12:22.874
The heart wants what it wants.

12:22.876 --> 12:25.510
He doesn't even know her.
He's making a mistake.

12:27.113 --> 12:29.748
Chloe, I know this isn't how
you saw things going

12:29.750 --> 12:33.485
but the worst thing you could do
right now is to keep holding on.

12:33.487 --> 12:36.254
Eric has moved on,
and you should too.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.388
[sighs]

12:37.390 --> 12:39.224
I can't move on.

12:39.226 --> 12:41.793
I've spent a third of my life
with him.

12:41.795 --> 12:44.295
Okay, time for some tough love.

12:44.297 --> 12:46.831
Your heart is shattered.

12:46.833 --> 12:49.434
Either you can roll around
in the sharp pieces

12:49.436 --> 12:50.802
or you can dust yourself off

12:50.804 --> 12:52.504
and pull yourself together.

12:54.306 --> 12:55.940
I choose rolling around.

12:57.910 --> 12:58.943
Sweetheart

13:00.279 --> 13:02.280
just put one foot
in front of the other.

13:03.382 --> 13:04.883
What am I gonna do?

13:06.285 --> 13:07.418
You need a break.

13:08.988 --> 13:11.322
From work, from this city

13:12.324 --> 13:14.859
and most of all, from Eric.

13:15.895 --> 13:17.996
But I can't just go on vacation.

13:17.998 --> 13:20.231
Oh, yes, you can.

13:20.233 --> 13:21.399
End of story.

13:23.969 --> 13:25.970
And I can too.

13:26.972 --> 13:29.574
In fact, I'm going with you.

13:29.576 --> 13:33.278
And I know just the place.

13:56.335 --> 13:59.037
Welcome to paradise.

13:59.039 --> 14:00.572
- Oh, it's perfect.
- 'Ha-ha-ha.'

14:02.007 --> 14:03.875
And strangely familiar.

14:05.044 --> 14:06.377
[Bonnie]
'I'll go check us in.'

14:07.513 --> 14:10.281
- Can you grab the bags?
- Sure.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.616
Okay.

14:14.053 --> 14:15.887
See you soon. Bye-bye.

14:21.060 --> 14:24.162
There he is, my favorite nephew!

14:24.164 --> 14:25.530
[both laughing]

14:25.532 --> 14:28.533
- Ohh!
- Aunt Bonnie..

14:28.535 --> 14:31.135
Sorry, I-I know
I called last minute.

14:31.137 --> 14:33.872
- You sure this is no trouble?
- No trouble at all.

14:33.874 --> 14:35.874
That's one of the perks
of being a manager.

14:35.876 --> 14:38.076
You got lucky. There was
a last minute cancelation.

14:38.078 --> 14:39.510
I reserved the block.

14:39.512 --> 14:41.512
So who's the other room for?

14:41.514 --> 14:44.916
Someone from the Bridge Club
or, uh, a hot date?

14:44.918 --> 14:46.017
A friend.

14:47.620 --> 14:50.355
- I think you'll like her.
- I like all of your friends

14:50.357 --> 14:52.924
except when they hug me
and they don't let go.

14:53.926 --> 14:56.060
This one's different.

14:56.062 --> 14:58.096
She'll be here in a minute
with the bags.

14:58.931 --> 15:00.031
Uh!

15:01.600 --> 15:03.067
Do me a favor.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.669
Check her in <i>personally.</i>

15:04.671 --> 15:06.938
What, you're not gonna
wait for her?

15:06.940 --> 15:11.175
It was a long drive,
and these bones could lie down.

15:11.177 --> 15:15.213
And in this way, you can get
a little one-on-one time

15:15.215 --> 15:17.282
without me breathing
over your shoulder.

15:17.284 --> 15:20.084
[chuckles]
You're kinda creeping me
out now.

15:20.086 --> 15:21.653
Let me know when you're free

15:21.655 --> 15:24.555
and you can treat us
to dinner, hm.

15:24.557 --> 15:26.090
[chuckles]

15:30.095 --> 15:31.696
Oh.. Uh..

15:31.698 --> 15:32.931
No.

15:35.534 --> 15:37.302
- It's okay. It's..
- Uh..

15:37.304 --> 15:39.570
Let me get those.

15:39.572 --> 15:41.239
That's okay. That's okay.
It's okay.

15:41.241 --> 15:42.974
I am losing this battle.

15:42.976 --> 15:44.242
[chuckles]

15:46.679 --> 15:48.613
Um, can you..

15:48.615 --> 15:50.548
...point me in the direction
of the manager?

15:51.984 --> 15:53.584
Yes, uh..

15:53.586 --> 15:55.219
Uh, that would me.

15:55.221 --> 15:56.387
- How can I help?
- Hi.

15:57.456 --> 15:59.123
I'm a friend of Miss Leigh.

16:00.326 --> 16:02.060
She said you'd take care of me.

16:03.729 --> 16:05.430
You're the friend
staying with her.

16:05.432 --> 16:06.965
- Yes.
- Hm.

16:06.967 --> 16:09.334
Well, I'm her doctor,
but I'm mostly her friend.

16:11.103 --> 16:13.304
- You're the doctor.
- Yes.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.073
[chuckling]

16:15.075 --> 16:16.641
- God.
- What?

16:16.643 --> 16:18.343
What.. Nothing, nothing.
I was just expecting

16:18.345 --> 16:20.511
someone, um...older.

16:21.580 --> 16:24.015
I get that a lot.

16:24.017 --> 16:26.517
So your room is right here,
we are right here.

16:27.519 --> 16:28.619
Your room is on the first floor.

16:28.621 --> 16:30.355
Miss Leigh has
the adjoining suite.

16:30.357 --> 16:31.756
I'll have someone bring
your bags up

16:31.758 --> 16:34.492
so no need to attack
any more plants. Okay?

16:34.494 --> 16:36.461
Thank you.
I'm sorry about that.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.663
I'm not usually such a mess.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.131
No worries.

16:40.133 --> 16:41.299
Enjoy your stay.

16:41.301 --> 16:43.134
And thank you for your..

16:43.136 --> 16:45.269
...you know, taking care of her.

16:45.271 --> 16:46.504
She means a lot to me.

16:52.478 --> 16:54.379
He really cares
about his guests.

17:01.520 --> 17:04.122
[instrumental music]

17:13.332 --> 17:15.233
Need some help?

17:15.234 --> 17:17.801
Oh. Yeah, I'm looking
for room 220.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.303
Oh, you're with the wedding.

17:19.305 --> 17:21.172
I'm Paige,
the event coordinator.

17:21.174 --> 17:22.573
No, I'm just looking
for my room.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.675
Oh. Weird.

17:24.676 --> 17:27.145
220 is in the reserved block.

17:27.146 --> 17:28.579
Let me just look that up.

17:29.815 --> 17:31.149
'Oh. Mm-hmm.'

17:31.151 --> 17:33.251
Hm, Pam and Dave Beresford
canceled.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.053
'Sorry about that.'

17:35.055 --> 17:37.555
You're just gonna wanna head
straight down that hallway.

17:40.559 --> 17:43.428
I'm sorry,
did you say "Beresford?"

17:43.430 --> 17:44.595
I sure did.

17:46.498 --> 17:48.166
Oh, no, u-um, yeah, okay.

17:49.435 --> 17:52.203
That is kind of confidential.

17:53.138 --> 17:54.405
She's so pretty.

17:55.441 --> 17:57.108
This is happening here?

17:57.110 --> 17:58.242
Yeah. Saturday.

17:58.244 --> 17:59.477
Please give me my folder back.

18:00.212 --> 18:02.213
[groaning]

18:06.618 --> 18:08.152
This can't be happening.

18:09.688 --> 18:11.222
Are you okay?

18:14.626 --> 18:15.827
Do you.. Ma'am?

18:24.203 --> 18:25.403
Thank you so much.

18:25.405 --> 18:26.637
Yes.

18:28.574 --> 18:30.308
- I'm so excited!
- I know.

18:30.310 --> 18:31.442
I can't believe
we're here, right?

18:31.444 --> 18:32.743
I mean, the cast
of the "Last Resort"

18:32.745 --> 18:34.545
could've taken a break
right here.

18:34.547 --> 18:36.314
Paul Roberts could've eaten
a sandwich right here.

18:36.316 --> 18:40.284
Yeah, well, that and, you know,
we're getting married!

18:40.286 --> 18:42.320
Ah, yes.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.288
Um. I know, I know,
I'm so sorry.

18:44.290 --> 18:46.557
I just.. I'm just getting
a little amped right now.

18:46.559 --> 18:49.660
[laughing]
You're so cute
when you're excited.

18:49.662 --> 18:50.761
Come here.

18:51.663 --> 18:53.164
[screaming]

18:53.166 --> 18:56.300
[woman screaming]
'Eric!'

18:57.769 --> 18:59.403
It's so exciting. Wait.

18:59.405 --> 19:01.172
Okay. Oh..

19:01.174 --> 19:03.207
- Well, mo-mom.
- Oh, whoa!

19:04.776 --> 19:07.678
Love the cobalt.
Okay, kids.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.147
How was your ride?

19:09.149 --> 19:11.349
This place is great.

19:11.351 --> 19:13.584
Here you go,
all of us at the Wigwam

19:13.586 --> 19:15.620
are very excited to be part
of your special day.

19:15.622 --> 19:17.455
Thank you.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.824
- Mr. Beresford, here you go.
- Thank you.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.492
And please if you need anything

19:21.494 --> 19:23.194
do not hesitate to call me.

19:23.196 --> 19:24.929
I'm very committed,
I haven't left the resort

19:24.931 --> 19:26.330
for a single day
in the past 12 months.

19:26.332 --> 19:29.834
- Oh, my goodness!
- Oh, wow.

19:29.836 --> 19:32.170
That's quite the work ethic.

19:32.172 --> 19:34.305
Oh, it's not work
when it's something you love.

19:34.307 --> 19:36.674
And, as requested,
you guys have the honor

19:36.676 --> 19:39.343
of staying in the same room
and bridal suites that

19:39.345 --> 19:42.547
Lacey and Albert used in the
series finale of "Last Resort."

19:42.549 --> 19:44.482
Oh!

19:45.517 --> 19:46.918
- I think I might cry.
- Oh.

19:46.920 --> 19:48.452
Save those tears
for the wedding.

19:48.454 --> 19:49.787
Make sure to check out
the gift shop

19:49.789 --> 19:51.722
and the "Last Resort" exhibit.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.858
It's filled with collectibles
and memorabilia.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.259
[laughing]

19:56.195 --> 19:57.361
Yes.

19:57.363 --> 19:58.563
I love this place.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.500
- Enjoy your stay.
- He's very excited.

20:05.637 --> 20:08.472
- Why is this happening?
- I am so sorry, Chloe.

20:08.474 --> 20:10.474
I-I-I had no idea.

20:10.476 --> 20:12.243
Does the universe
want me to drown

20:12.245 --> 20:13.744
in a pool of my own tears?

20:16.248 --> 20:17.648
Maybe I should leave.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.383
[Bonnie]
'You're not going anywhere.'

20:19.385 --> 20:22.853
Not until we know everything.

20:22.855 --> 20:27.258
Okay, um, it's just that
I'm the wedding coordinator

20:27.260 --> 20:30.228
and she's clearly hung up
on the groom.

20:32.397 --> 20:34.899
Feels kinda like
a conflict of interest.

20:34.901 --> 20:38.369
Please help me.
I just.. I can't..

20:39.238 --> 20:41.973
So, tell us everything.

20:47.579 --> 20:48.879
There's really nothing to tell.

20:48.881 --> 20:50.781
We haven't even begun
setting up yet.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.717
Well, except for the reception

20:52.719 --> 20:54.785
because by some miracle,
they were able to reserve

20:54.787 --> 20:57.021
the grand garden until Saturday.

20:57.023 --> 20:59.624
So we have plenty of time
to set up.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.592
Can I see it?

21:03.295 --> 21:04.395
Please?

21:30.622 --> 21:32.790
[Hunter]
'Beautiful, isn't it?'

21:32.792 --> 21:36.294
Yeah. Sorry, I didn't know
anyone was out here.

21:36.296 --> 21:39.497
No, please,
stay as long as you need.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.332
I'm just figuring out
some logistics

21:41.334 --> 21:43.567
for the big event
on Saturday.

21:43.569 --> 21:45.736
Not to brag, but this is
gonna be a gorgeous wedding.

21:45.738 --> 21:47.571
Hm.

21:47.573 --> 21:48.606
That's great.

21:49.474 --> 21:50.608
But you don't care.

21:52.511 --> 21:53.744
Usually, people are
pretty happy

21:53.746 --> 21:55.846
when they hear wedding.

21:55.848 --> 21:58.849
I guess it depends
on who's hearing it.

21:58.851 --> 22:01.686
[chuckles]
Why, you're in love
with the groom or something?

22:01.688 --> 22:03.754
No. Of course not.

22:03.756 --> 22:05.523
- That would be..
- Crazy.

22:05.525 --> 22:06.557
Yeah.

22:08.694 --> 22:10.695
[cell phone buzzing]

22:14.599 --> 22:16.634
They're buzzing me up front.

22:16.636 --> 22:18.369
It's okay.

22:18.371 --> 22:21.706
- I can stay if you want--
- No. Please, go.

22:21.708 --> 22:23.708
Don't stay on my account.

22:32.651 --> 22:34.118
I'm not suggesting anything

22:34.120 --> 22:36.887
but if there was someone
in the wedding party

22:36.889 --> 22:39.490
you wanted to see

22:39.492 --> 22:42.693
you might see them at
the private wedding dinner.

22:43.895 --> 22:45.396
7 p.m.

22:46.665 --> 22:48.733
- Thank you.
- Nah.

22:48.735 --> 22:50.735
What can I say

22:50.737 --> 22:52.403
I'm a sucker for romance.

22:54.740 --> 22:56.807
You sure you'll be good?

22:56.809 --> 22:58.409
Yeah. I'll be fine.

23:00.412 --> 23:01.445
Okay.

23:06.518 --> 23:07.551
I'll be fine.

23:18.463 --> 23:21.465
[indistinct chatter]

23:27.005 --> 23:29.006
[attendant]
I hope you all enjoyed
<i>ze</i> appetizer.

23:30.041 --> 23:32.176
And what shall you have, madam?

23:32.178 --> 23:34.845
It's actually what I can't have.

23:34.847 --> 23:37.581
I'm a vegetarian,
but I also have

23:37.583 --> 23:40.084
a gluten, lactose
and soy intolerance.

23:40.086 --> 23:41.452
And, you know, this is
gonna sound weird

23:41.454 --> 23:42.853
but I'm allergic to avocados

23:42.855 --> 23:44.722
and whitefish and eggplants.

23:44.724 --> 23:46.724
And here is the most
important thing.

23:46.726 --> 23:47.925
If I eat nuts

23:47.927 --> 23:50.461
my life is pretty much over.

23:50.463 --> 23:53.464
May I suggest <i>ze</i> pea soup?

23:53.466 --> 23:54.565
Perfect.

24:00.740 --> 24:02.506
- Thank you.
- Mom.

24:05.710 --> 24:07.044
Good work.

24:07.046 --> 24:10.481
Wonderful chopping..
I'm just gonna--

24:10.483 --> 24:11.782
[shouts in foreign language]

24:11.784 --> 24:14.652
Uh.. Okay.

24:14.654 --> 24:17.188
Calm down, it's just looking.

24:18.657 --> 24:19.924
There's nothing wrong
with looking.

24:21.193 --> 24:23.794
[clears throat]
Excuse me, everyone.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.796
Hey, uh, I'd like
to make a toast.

and life's too short

24:35.074 --> 24:38.108

to your last resort?"

24:38.110 --> 24:40.211
Aww!

24:40.213 --> 24:42.079
Is he quoting the theme song?

24:42.081 --> 24:45.583
Okay, it's from an '80s
sitcom theme song.

24:45.585 --> 24:48.486
'Uh, but no, 'Lyssa, you are
far from my last resort.'

24:53.825 --> 24:55.025
When I first met you..

24:56.761 --> 24:59.129
...my heart was broken.

24:59.131 --> 25:01.499
I didn't think that
I could ever love again

25:01.501 --> 25:02.566
'or be loved'

25:03.235 --> 25:05.269
but you proved me wrong.

25:05.271 --> 25:07.838
You're my first, my last

25:07.840 --> 25:09.607
and final resort
for the rest of my life

25:09.609 --> 25:10.808
and I can't wait to be
beside you

25:10.810 --> 25:12.543
for every second of it.

25:21.052 --> 25:22.720

- Aah!

25:29.195 --> 25:30.794
What are you doing here?

25:30.796 --> 25:32.029
What am I doing here?

25:33.198 --> 25:34.965
I'm a doctor

25:34.967 --> 25:37.635
and I'm checking out
a patient.

25:37.637 --> 25:39.670
From <i>ze</i> kitchen?

25:39.672 --> 25:40.838
It's complicated!

25:40.840 --> 25:42.039
[clears throat]

25:44.976 --> 25:46.310
- Eric.
- Yeah?

25:46.312 --> 25:50.180
Um, was there, uh, pesto
in your appetizer?

25:51.049 --> 25:52.283
Yeah. I think so.

25:52.285 --> 25:53.751
[clears throat]

25:53.753 --> 25:55.719
- We just kissed.
- Yeah.

25:57.756 --> 26:02.092
[clears throat]
There's, um,
pine nuts in pesto.

26:02.094 --> 26:03.928
My throat is closing up.

26:03.930 --> 26:05.763
- You need a doctor? A doctor..
- My throat is..

We need a doctor, a doctor!

'No. No, no, no.'

26:15.307 --> 26:18.342
No, no. Please, please.
No, aah..

26:19.711 --> 26:21.879
Here is <i>ze</i> doctor!

26:23.348 --> 26:25.115
- Chloe.
- Eric!

26:25.117 --> 26:27.618
- Chloe!
- Mrs. Beresford.

26:27.620 --> 26:29.219
Sorry, talk later.
I'm in doctor mode.

26:33.358 --> 26:35.859
I'm going to inject you
with an EpiPen, okay.

[screaming]

26:53.979 --> 26:55.346
[groaning]

26:55.348 --> 26:56.981
I heard there was

from the collision.

27:04.089 --> 27:06.357
Okay. How are you feeling?

27:07.258 --> 27:09.293
Better. Thank you.

27:09.295 --> 27:11.996
Any dizziness? Nausea?

Difficulty breathing?

27:13.833 --> 27:15.165
- No.
- Okay.

27:15.167 --> 27:17.768
Everything is..
I think is normal.

27:20.839 --> 27:22.840
What are you doing here?

27:22.842 --> 27:24.842
Oh, you two know each other.

27:24.844 --> 27:26.644
Yeah, this is my ex.

27:26.646 --> 27:29.313
The one who cast you
into the wilderness?

27:29.315 --> 27:30.648
Yeah, this is the one.

27:30.650 --> 27:32.082
Wilderness?

27:33.151 --> 27:34.785
This isn't what you think.

27:34.787 --> 27:36.320
I didn't cast you anywhere.

27:36.322 --> 27:38.255
Maybe a gentle nudge
out of the nest

27:38.257 --> 27:40.924
but obviously
that worked out great!

27:40.926 --> 27:43.894
You must like the results,
I mean, look at him!

27:45.330 --> 27:48.298
- Did you follow me here?
- What? No!

27:48.300 --> 27:50.100
I'm supposed to believe
it's just pure coincidence

27:50.102 --> 27:51.835
you showed up at this resort
as I'm about to get married

27:51.837 --> 27:53.270
- like, in a couple of days.
- It is!

27:53.272 --> 27:54.438
Why'd you come out
of the kitchen?

27:54.440 --> 27:55.806
Doctors don't come out
of the kitchen.

27:55.808 --> 27:56.940
Why are you here?

27:58.677 --> 28:00.811
- Uh..
- She's with me.

28:00.813 --> 28:02.146
What?

28:04.816 --> 28:06.850
- She's my girlfriend.
- Huh?

28:08.420 --> 28:10.788
- Girlfriend?
- You two are dating?

28:10.790 --> 28:12.356
- Yeah.
- Oh.

28:12.358 --> 28:15.693
- Isn't that wonderful, Eric?
- Yeah.

28:15.695 --> 28:19.063
Chloe, Eric has told me
so much about you.

28:19.065 --> 28:21.832
It's nice to finally meet you,
little odd this way

28:21.834 --> 28:23.434
stabbing me in the thigh
and all.

28:23.436 --> 28:25.002
Bet that felt good.

28:25.004 --> 28:27.738
[laughing]
Just doing my job.

28:27.740 --> 28:29.907
Yes, speaking of job

28:29.909 --> 28:31.375
how did the waiter know
that you're a doctor?

28:32.877 --> 28:33.911
[Chloe]
'Um..'

28:34.879 --> 28:36.080
Because she works here.

28:37.382 --> 28:39.216
- Oh.
- What?

28:41.052 --> 28:42.086
- At a resort?
- Yes.

28:42.088 --> 28:43.153
Resorts aren't your thing.

28:43.155 --> 28:44.388
Especially not
the "Last Resort."

28:44.390 --> 28:45.989
I mean, at least
six months ago it wasn't.

28:45.991 --> 28:47.224
No, that was my doing.

28:47.226 --> 28:49.493
Um, we needed
a medical assistant

28:49.495 --> 28:50.761
and she needed a vacation.

28:51.996 --> 28:53.731
I can be very persuasive.

28:54.899 --> 28:58.035
Oh. How wonderful.

28:58.037 --> 29:02.072
Oh, what a wonderful change
of pace for you.

29:02.074 --> 29:06.243
Yes...I work here now.

29:06.245 --> 29:08.278
It's such a crazy,
random coincidence

29:08.280 --> 29:10.114
running into you here.

29:10.116 --> 29:13.517
Well, we would love to take
you and your boyfriend

29:13.519 --> 29:18.122
out to dinner as a thank you
for helping me breathe again.

29:18.124 --> 29:19.857
No, you don't wanna do that.

29:19.859 --> 29:21.525
- We'd love to.
- Ah.

29:21.527 --> 29:22.793
No..

29:23.361 --> 29:24.361
Oh.

29:24.363 --> 29:25.395
Hey!

29:25.397 --> 29:26.964
[camera clicking]

29:29.134 --> 29:31.802
What are you doing? Why are we
going to dinner with them?

29:31.804 --> 29:33.871
You were acting like
a crazy person.

29:33.873 --> 29:35.405
I had to do something
before you blurted out

29:35.407 --> 29:37.508
[as Chloe]
"I'm still in love with him!"

29:37.510 --> 29:39.042
I totally called that,
by the way.

29:39.044 --> 29:42.212
Could you just not say things
you can't un-say.

29:42.214 --> 29:45.315
He's getting married.
That's pretty messed up.

29:45.317 --> 29:47.117
I didn't plan this.
It just happened.

29:47.119 --> 29:49.153
Yeah, you're right, you just
happened to be eavesdropping

29:49.155 --> 29:50.788
while she went
into anaphylactic shock.

29:50.790 --> 29:52.456
Don't...push my buttons.

who just saved you'

29:58.564 --> 30:00.831
No, I'm sorry.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.067
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

30:04.069 --> 30:06.570
Really, you didn't
have to do that.

30:06.572 --> 30:08.071
I know.

30:11.009 --> 30:13.343
Why did you do that?

30:13.345 --> 30:15.846
I've been a third wheel before.
I know it can be rough.

30:18.183 --> 30:20.951
Plus you were floppin' around
like a dying fish in there.

30:20.953 --> 30:22.553
'It was painful to watch.'

30:22.555 --> 30:24.955
Just when you were starting to
be decent.

30:26.825 --> 30:27.991
It's a gift.

30:29.861 --> 30:31.862
Why are you being
so nice about this?

30:31.864 --> 30:33.997
'It's what any decent man
would've done.'

30:35.366 --> 30:37.334
Plus I like to treat
my employees.

30:39.103 --> 30:40.838
I wasn't joking about the job.

30:42.507 --> 30:44.374
We do need a medical assistant.

30:44.376 --> 30:46.844
And you've done more medical
work in the past 15 minutes

30:46.846 --> 30:48.278
than Dr. James
in the past 15 days.

30:48.280 --> 30:50.047
[chuckles]

30:50.049 --> 30:52.583
- You can't be serious?
- I'm very serious.

30:53.952 --> 30:55.519
Report to the clinic
tomorrow morning.

30:55.521 --> 30:57.321
Dr. James will
bring you up to speed.

31:00.291 --> 31:02.993
Oh, and..

31:02.995 --> 31:05.395
...you might wanna
clean off the suit.

31:05.397 --> 31:07.397
Looks like a baby alien
just puked on you.

31:10.568 --> 31:12.035
Goodnight.

<i>I should've left the moment</i>
<i>I knew he was here.</i>

31:20.312 --> 31:22.913
You didn't follow him here.

31:22.915 --> 31:24.982
You're on vacation.

31:26.217 --> 31:28.252
I followed him to dinner.

31:28.254 --> 31:30.087
It was awful.

31:30.089 --> 31:31.989
Luckily, the manager
came to my rescue

31:31.991 --> 31:33.523
before I died of embarrassment.

31:33.525 --> 31:35.092
Manager?

31:35.094 --> 31:36.960
- Hunter?
- Yeah.

31:38.062 --> 31:40.330
- What?
- O-oh, nothing.

31:40.332 --> 31:44.234
It's just nice that
he's being helpful.

31:44.236 --> 31:48.205
Look at you, rubbing elbows
with handsome young men.

31:49.574 --> 31:51.642
He's only doing it out of pity.

Don't get too excited.

'And why is that?'

at his wedding venue.

You're not here to stalk Eric,
you're here to take a break.

32:09.128 --> 32:10.661
From him.

32:10.663 --> 32:12.362
How can I do that
if he's here?

32:13.464 --> 32:16.266
By letting him see
you've moved on.

32:18.469 --> 32:21.438
Besides, I got you this room,
and you're my ride home.

Oh, wonderful, nice to meet you.

33:09.722 --> 33:11.355
It's been a week
since my last one left

33:11.357 --> 33:13.256
and I've had to do
everything around here.

33:13.258 --> 33:15.025
Oh!

33:15.027 --> 33:16.493
Must've been rough.

33:16.495 --> 33:18.662
Oh, you have no idea.
It's been a nightmare.

33:18.664 --> 33:21.765
I had to reschedule
my deep tissue massage twice.

33:21.767 --> 33:23.200
Twice.

33:23.202 --> 33:24.501
- Hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

33:24.503 --> 33:27.537
Well, I can assure you
I'm very good at my job.

33:27.539 --> 33:28.572
I'm very committed.

33:28.574 --> 33:30.040
Well, I-I'm sure your talents

33:30.042 --> 33:32.142
are probably more
than we'll actually need.

33:32.144 --> 33:35.178
What you'll be dealing mostly
with around here is sunburn.

33:35.180 --> 33:37.214
Very bad sunburn.

33:37.216 --> 33:40.450
Ah, you know what,
now that you're on board

33:40.452 --> 33:42.219
uh, if-if you don't mind

33:44.055 --> 33:46.556

meeting with a bowl of lobster.

33:50.562 --> 33:52.229
Okay.

33:52.231 --> 33:55.032
Um, what should I do
while you're gone?

33:55.034 --> 33:57.134
Oh, um, ah, here we are.

33:59.237 --> 34:01.071
This is a fascinating exhibit

of the "Last Resort."

34:05.043 --> 34:08.779

Well, hold down the fort.
I shall return.

34:15.420 --> 34:16.585
[bell rings]

34:17.722 --> 34:20.424
Is everyone wearing sunscreen?

34:20.426 --> 34:23.260
Kids, have we reapplied?

34:24.594 --> 34:26.730
I don't wanna see anyone
in the clinic tonight.

34:28.331 --> 34:31.101
Sun protection is important.
I'm talking to you.

34:37.842 --> 34:41.110
Alright, troops, listen up.

34:41.112 --> 34:43.112
To summarize..

34:43.114 --> 34:44.380
Basal cell

34:44.382 --> 34:47.117
squamous cell and melanoma

34:47.119 --> 34:50.286
are the three leading
causes of skin cancer.

34:51.289 --> 34:54.458
The longer they remain untreated

34:54.460 --> 34:56.293
the greater
the certainty of death.

34:57.762 --> 34:59.863
Questions?

34:59.865 --> 35:02.399
And they say medicine
isn't fun, huh?

35:02.401 --> 35:04.601
[laughs]
How about some Marco Polo, kids?

35:04.603 --> 35:06.736

35:13.478 --> 35:15.645
Rain check on
the Marco Polo, kids.

I just spotted an angel.

01:00:49.079 --> 01:00:51.079
it's like I practically
know you.

01:00:51.081 --> 01:00:53.181
- He does?
- All the time.

01:00:53.183 --> 01:00:55.250
I mean,
if we weren't getting married

01:00:55.252 --> 01:00:56.685
I'd probably be jealous.

01:00:56.687 --> 01:00:58.654
[nervous laughter]

01:01:00.023 --> 01:01:02.290
I don't know,
it's hard to explain.

01:01:02.292 --> 01:01:04.726
It's, um..

01:01:04.728 --> 01:01:06.194
'It's like Eric and I..'

01:01:07.997 --> 01:01:09.765
It's like
we understand each other

01:01:09.767 --> 01:01:12.000
so well.

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:14.703
But then there are times

01:01:14.705 --> 01:01:17.873
where I feel like
I don't know him at all.

01:01:17.875 --> 01:01:19.875
Does that make any sense?

01:01:20.677 --> 01:01:22.444
Actually, yeah.

01:01:22.446 --> 01:01:24.346
We dated for ten years
and sometimes

01:01:24.348 --> 01:01:26.214
it feels like I still
have a lot to learn.

01:01:26.216 --> 01:01:28.850
Exactly. Okay, see,
this is why

01:01:28.852 --> 01:01:30.118
I wanted your help.

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:33.889
You have this insight into Eric

01:01:34.857 --> 01:01:36.892
that I..

01:01:37.894 --> 01:01:38.994
But don't worry about it

01:01:38.996 --> 01:01:42.030
it was a bad idea, and um..

01:01:42.032 --> 01:01:43.899
I just don't wanna
screw things up.

01:01:43.901 --> 01:01:47.335
But, um, I'm sorry

01:01:47.337 --> 01:01:49.237
I'm sorry to bother you.

01:01:52.175 --> 01:01:54.976
[Chloe]
'Alyssa, I can take a break.'

01:02:04.053 --> 01:02:06.088
So...thoughts?

01:02:07.256 --> 01:02:10.192
It's beautiful.

01:02:10.194 --> 01:02:13.261
I see "Last Resort"
made it to the reception.

01:02:13.263 --> 01:02:16.865
Isn't it great?
Eric loved it.

01:02:16.867 --> 01:02:19.768
You are a saint
for putting up with that.

01:02:19.770 --> 01:02:22.370
A lot of women might be
turned off by his obsession.

01:02:22.372 --> 01:02:24.873
Oh, no, this whole thing
was my idea.

01:02:24.875 --> 01:02:25.974
I surprised him with
the cardboard cutouts.

01:02:25.976 --> 01:02:27.209
- Really?
- Well.

01:02:27.211 --> 01:02:29.111
He would never admit this
but we both know

01:02:29.113 --> 01:02:30.412
I'm the bigger super fan.

01:02:31.848 --> 01:02:34.750
Oh, Chloe, I would
like you to meet Paige.

01:02:34.752 --> 01:02:36.418
She is the resort's
wedding planner.

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:37.919
Event coordinator.

01:02:37.921 --> 01:02:39.955
- Yes, we've met. Hi, Paige.
- Hi.

01:02:39.957 --> 01:02:41.123
Which do you like?

01:02:41.125 --> 01:02:44.760
Ceramic? Rustic? Or Tropicana?

01:02:44.762 --> 01:02:47.028
Um..

01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:48.830
All of them?

01:02:48.832 --> 01:02:50.198
Okay, great.

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:52.901
I'll put all of them
on all of the tables.

01:02:54.103 --> 01:02:56.037
Um..

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:01.977
I don't know.

01:03:05.982 --> 01:03:07.983
Is this all too much?

01:03:10.319 --> 01:03:12.888
Is Eric an extravagant
wedding type?

01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:16.825
Well..

01:03:16.827 --> 01:03:18.326
It's, uh..

01:03:20.096 --> 01:03:21.296
Please..

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:23.799
'...be honest.'

01:03:26.235 --> 01:03:28.069
My wedding depends on it.

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:34.843
Well, when Eric and I
were dating

01:03:34.845 --> 01:03:37.479
and our friends
started having these

01:03:37.481 --> 01:03:40.148
huge over the top weddings

01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:42.484
we would go
just to make fun of them.

01:03:45.354 --> 01:03:46.988
Wow!

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:48.924
I never
would've guessed that.

01:03:48.926 --> 01:03:51.827
Yeah, Eric hated this..

01:03:52.929 --> 01:03:54.996
...extravagant stuff.

01:03:58.034 --> 01:03:59.835
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:03.138
But people change, I guess.

01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:05.040
Um, we-well, um..

01:04:05.042 --> 01:04:08.610
He hasn't really seen
any of the plans.

01:04:08.612 --> 01:04:10.612
Do you think that
this is too much?

01:04:12.181 --> 01:04:13.315
Maybe..

01:04:14.383 --> 01:04:16.384
...for the Eric I knew.

01:04:16.386 --> 01:04:18.153
But, hey

01:04:18.155 --> 01:04:19.487
you know him
better than me, right?

01:04:19.489 --> 01:04:21.923
[laughs]
You're getting married to him.

01:04:23.893 --> 01:04:26.394
I'm sure he's gonna love it.

01:04:29.031 --> 01:04:31.233
Well, I better get back
to saving lives.

01:04:35.638 --> 01:04:37.472
Oh, God.

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:42.477
[instrumental music]

01:04:46.515 --> 01:04:48.216
Paul Roberts.

01:04:49.485 --> 01:04:50.652
Where're you going?

01:04:52.154 --> 01:04:55.490
Hey! Hey, you. Stop. Hey.

01:04:57.159 --> 01:04:58.360
What're you doing with that?

01:04:58.362 --> 01:05:00.428
- Just throwing away this junk.
- Junk?

01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:02.230
That's not..
That's for my wedding.

01:05:02.232 --> 01:05:05.066
- Who told you to do that?
- The bride.

01:05:05.068 --> 01:05:07.002
- The bride?
- Yeah.

01:05:13.943 --> 01:05:15.443
I got you.

01:05:16.913 --> 01:05:18.213
What is going on here?

01:05:25.288 --> 01:05:28.290
[instrumental music]

01:05:40.036 --> 01:05:42.037
What am I doin'?

01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:50.412
[exhales]

01:06:05.461 --> 01:06:07.729
- Eric.
- Hi.

01:06:07.731 --> 01:06:10.131
- Hi.
- I, uh..

01:06:11.334 --> 01:06:13.101
I need to talk to you.

01:06:13.103 --> 01:06:14.602
Yeah.

01:06:14.604 --> 01:06:16.304
Me, too.

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:18.707
Man, this was all a big mistake.

01:06:18.709 --> 01:06:20.742
I mean, what is going on.

01:06:20.744 --> 01:06:23.011
I'm about to get married..

01:06:23.013 --> 01:06:24.746
...to a woman who I've known
for less than six months.

01:06:24.748 --> 01:06:26.348
You and I were together
for ten years

01:06:26.350 --> 01:06:28.350
and you tried so hard..

01:06:29.652 --> 01:06:31.186
...to make it work.

01:06:32.521 --> 01:06:34.189
And I didn't see it then.

01:06:36.192 --> 01:06:39.027
Just...wait.

01:06:42.031 --> 01:06:44.165
What are you saying?

01:06:46.035 --> 01:06:47.369
I'm saying, that when you
kicked me to the curb

01:06:47.371 --> 01:06:50.038
it hurt...a lot.

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:53.341
And I was scared.

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:57.545
Ten years is a lot to lose.

01:06:58.748 --> 01:07:00.749
And so when Alyssa
came along

01:07:00.751 --> 01:07:02.617
I didn't want to see
that happen again.

01:07:06.555 --> 01:07:08.757
But I think I went too far
in the opposite direction.

01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:13.795
So..

01:07:13.797 --> 01:07:16.064
It's just that, everything's
happened too fast.

01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:19.067
You know?

01:07:19.069 --> 01:07:21.302
I'm.. I don't even know
what I'm feelin' anymore.

01:07:23.672 --> 01:07:25.573
The last few days
have just been..

01:07:25.575 --> 01:07:27.509
...off between
Alyssa and I.

01:07:28.811 --> 01:07:31.579
You know, I just need to
talk to her.

01:07:31.581 --> 01:07:35.083
Yeah, I think we just jumped
into this little too fast and..

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:37.085
[exhales]

01:07:40.222 --> 01:07:42.257
I don't even know if we should
get married tomorrow.

01:07:43.692 --> 01:07:46.394
No, Eric, you can't do that.

01:07:48.697 --> 01:07:50.598
I need to talk to her.

01:07:52.201 --> 01:07:53.668
I gotta.

01:07:55.604 --> 01:07:59.274
And I don't know what's gonna
happen between us. I don't.

01:07:59.276 --> 01:08:01.443
You know, but maybe
somewhere amongst this

01:08:01.445 --> 01:08:03.244
there's some kind of
happy ending.

01:08:07.683 --> 01:08:10.452
...maybe it'd stop me
from making a big mistake.

01:08:14.223 --> 01:08:17.225
[music continues]

01:08:50.658 --> 01:08:51.859
There you are.

01:08:51.862 --> 01:08:53.394
I was worried I'd go to sleep

01:08:53.395 --> 01:08:54.595
the day before my wedding

01:08:54.598 --> 01:08:56.663
without a goodnight kiss
from the groom.

01:08:59.335 --> 01:09:01.202
Eric, what's wrong?

01:09:07.643 --> 01:09:10.478
- Hi, Ms. Huddleston.
- Hi.

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:12.647
Um, I was wondering
if I could talk to you

01:09:12.649 --> 01:09:13.915
about the wedding tomorrow.

01:09:13.917 --> 01:09:16.184
Of course.

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:17.685
[Alyssa clears throat]

01:09:17.687 --> 01:09:18.920
How can I help?

01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:21.456
Uh.. Um..

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:23.191
Well..

01:09:25.528 --> 01:09:27.495
Is it possible to cancel?

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:34.669
[instrumental music]

01:09:39.642 --> 01:09:41.309
[Hunter]
Been lookin'
everywhere for you.

01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:43.778
I-I just spoke with Alyssa,
the wedding is off.

01:09:47.816 --> 01:09:50.484
Eric and I talked..

01:09:50.487 --> 01:09:52.687
He's not ready to get married.

01:09:54.823 --> 01:09:56.824
It's their decision.

01:09:56.826 --> 01:09:58.726
What, he has cold feet,
and you're ready to pick up

01:09:58.728 --> 01:10:00.795
where you left off
six months ago?

01:10:00.797 --> 01:10:02.931
It's not as simple as
you're making it sound.

01:10:02.933 --> 01:10:05.567
Then, please
spell it out for me, Chloe.

01:10:05.569 --> 01:10:08.670
I never wanted to change him.

01:10:08.672 --> 01:10:11.206
I just wanted him to care
as much as I did.

01:10:15.244 --> 01:10:17.545
I wanted him to be the man
that I knew he could be.

01:10:20.883 --> 01:10:22.650
But he never did.

01:10:23.819 --> 01:10:25.520
Why didn't he try for me?

01:10:25.522 --> 01:10:27.722
Why don't I deserve a chance?

01:10:37.399 --> 01:10:39.601
He's in love with her.

01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:42.670
It's awful.

01:10:44.273 --> 01:10:46.341
I wish it didn't
tear you up so much.

01:10:48.277 --> 01:10:49.978
'But you have no right to ruin
their chance at happiness.'

01:10:54.850 --> 01:10:57.285
He's only backing down
because you stayed here.

01:10:57.287 --> 01:10:59.254
And reminded him
how amazing you are.

01:11:00.589 --> 01:11:01.689
[crying]

01:11:03.626 --> 01:11:05.526
But that's just
remembering what you had.

01:11:07.997 --> 01:11:10.431
'Ten years of memories
will give anyone cold feet.'

01:11:16.305 --> 01:11:18.439
You have to let him go.

01:11:20.743 --> 01:11:23.344
I don't know if I can.

01:11:25.814 --> 01:11:27.282
Okay.

01:11:28.050 --> 01:11:29.317
Um..

01:11:29.319 --> 01:11:30.818
[exhales]

01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:32.387
Then I can't be a part of this.

01:11:33.956 --> 01:11:35.290
If you're not willing
to at least

01:11:35.292 --> 01:11:37.325
try to save what they have.

01:11:37.327 --> 01:11:38.893
Then, maybe..

01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:43.331
Maybe we both have
some thinking to do.

01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:54.942
[music continues]

01:12:24.973 --> 01:12:26.541
Did you do this?

01:12:27.710 --> 01:12:29.344
[crying]
Yes.

01:12:32.481 --> 01:12:33.948
[crying]

01:12:37.886 --> 01:12:41.089
I'm sorry. I know you worked
really hard on it.

01:12:41.091 --> 01:12:42.657
I don't care about that.

01:12:43.692 --> 01:12:46.828
Chloe, they were really happy.

01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:48.963
I'd give anything
to have what they have.

01:12:50.399 --> 01:12:51.666
Had.

01:12:52.701 --> 01:12:54.502
I know..

01:12:54.504 --> 01:12:58.106
But I promise I never meant
for any of this to happen.

01:12:58.108 --> 01:13:00.575
And Hunter thinks
I'm an awful person.

01:13:02.144 --> 01:13:04.145
I am an awful person.

01:13:09.752 --> 01:13:11.419
You're not an awful person.

01:13:11.421 --> 01:13:13.388
[sobbing]

01:13:13.390 --> 01:13:14.822
You've been hurting.

01:13:17.059 --> 01:13:18.893
You wanna stop beating
yourself up about it?

01:13:20.429 --> 01:13:22.430
You know what
you have to do, right?

01:13:26.001 --> 01:13:27.902
I have to make sure
they get married.

01:13:27.904 --> 01:13:29.604
No more awful person.

01:13:29.606 --> 01:13:31.773
No more mad Hunter.

01:13:31.775 --> 01:13:33.040
Piece of cake.

01:13:34.543 --> 01:13:37.678
But how am I supposed to
salvage their wedding?

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:39.013
Get creative.

01:13:39.015 --> 01:13:40.515
There's gotta be something
to bring those

01:13:40.517 --> 01:13:41.949
two weirdos together.
