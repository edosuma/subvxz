- (Men screaming)
- (Horses neighing)

00:17.126 --> 00:19.837
(Horses galloping)

00:25.134 --> 00:27.845
(Swords clashing)

00:33.142 --> 00:35.436
(Men yelling)

00:40.191 --> 00:43.777
My Lady, they are upon us.

00:43.861 --> 00:47.198
The Khan has come.
Run for the desert.

01:12.098 --> 01:13.641
Lady Kokachin.

01:22.691 --> 01:25.444
You're protected by your blood.
They will not harm you.

01:25.528 --> 01:28.656
Harm me? No.

01:28.739 --> 01:32.201
Take me into Kublai's harem? Yes.

01:35.746 --> 01:37.456
Is it not better than death?

01:37.540 --> 01:38.999
No, NergÃ¼i...

01:41.460 --> 01:45.923
to live under the yoke of a Khan
is not better than the Eternal Blue.

01:46.006 --> 01:47.050
(Gasps)

01:47.133 --> 01:48.426
(Gasps)

01:51.179 --> 01:52.680
Lady Kokachin!

01:52.763 --> 01:53.972
(Sobbing)

02:10.531 --> 02:12.533
(Theme music playing)

03:45.376 --> 03:47.586
Do we have to attend?

03:47.670 --> 03:49.797
Your absence would be noted.

03:51.089 --> 03:52.591
Khutulun...

03:52.675 --> 03:54.510
that wrestling whore from the west.

03:54.593 --> 04:00.808
Please expel any of your contempt within
the confines of these walls, Princess.

04:00.891 --> 04:02.100
Why is she coming here?

04:02.185 --> 04:04.395
I do not know
and it does not matter.

04:04.478 --> 04:07.315
You will conduct yourself
as you always do...

04:07.398 --> 04:09.858
with graciousness.

04:11.569 --> 04:14.655
You may have more in common
than you imagine.

04:15.573 --> 04:17.158
That's doubtful.

04:17.241 --> 04:18.451
(Clicks tongue)

04:18.534 --> 04:21.329
You lost another trinket.

04:23.206 --> 04:25.123
A bracelet.

04:25.208 --> 04:27.168
It slipped off my wrist as I rode.

04:28.919 --> 04:31.046
A poor decision
to wear it on my whip hand.

04:31.129 --> 04:34.007
Yes, a poor decision.

04:35.426 --> 04:39.930
You take great risk to avoid
a greater danger, I understand.

04:40.514 --> 04:43.058
In celebration
of this New Year...

04:43.141 --> 04:46.604
perhaps you would allow me
to eliminate this danger...

04:48.021 --> 04:50.733
with my sword.

04:50.816 --> 04:52.401
I do not.

05:13.964 --> 05:15.299
Father.

05:18.469 --> 05:24.182
An auspicious day for departure.
Tsagaan Sar.

05:29.855 --> 05:32.441
What you did saved our lives.

05:32.525 --> 05:35.569
I know this.

05:35.653 --> 05:37.112
Your uncle knows, too...

05:38.406 --> 05:40.741
but will not confess it.

05:42.618 --> 05:44.202
I fear...

05:44.287 --> 05:47.831
I will require another New Year
to repay the debt I owe.

05:47.915 --> 05:50.751
The Khan will never allow you
back into the Imperial City.

05:52.795 --> 05:56.173
We will meet again.

05:59.677 --> 06:01.053
(Grunts)

06:02.596 --> 06:06.350
Rot here, nephew...
with your devils.

06:06.434 --> 06:09.227
We go to the Silk Road to die.

06:15.818 --> 06:18.654
(Byamba) The brothers Polo
have lost their golden tablet.

06:18.737 --> 06:20.113
Yes.

06:20.197 --> 06:22.240
Imperial pass rescinded.

06:22.325 --> 06:23.992
I know.

06:24.076 --> 06:27.245
No lodging, no fresh horses,
no vittles.

06:27.330 --> 06:30.458
- They are vulnerable now to bandits.
- Byamba, I know.

06:30.541 --> 06:32.918
It's nothing they do not deserve.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.296
(Byamba)
We should go.

06:36.380 --> 06:39.717
The Great Khan will be expecting
an answer before the White Moon.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.928
- We must offer him a head.
- We must offer him the right head.

06:50.060 --> 06:51.437
(Khutulun)
Polo!

06:55.858 --> 07:00.070
Did you come to greet me?
I'm touched.

07:00.153 --> 07:01.572
Did you miss Khutulun?

07:01.655 --> 07:04.408
The sun felt warmer
on my face this morning.

07:04.492 --> 07:05.826
Now I know why.

07:07.703 --> 07:10.205
I'm to present myself
to the Great Khan.

07:10.288 --> 07:11.582
Come, witness the pomp.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.542
We are called to duty, Lady.

07:13.626 --> 07:14.627
Come.

07:14.710 --> 07:18.255
Escort me or I will
tell the Khan of your disrespect.

07:41.153 --> 07:43.822
Plans been finalized
for the festival?

07:43.906 --> 07:46.367
They have.
The games will commence.

07:46.450 --> 07:47.743
Good.

07:52.581 --> 07:54.041
Hmm?

07:54.124 --> 07:56.293
The Latin's mission to Kochkor...

07:56.377 --> 07:58.921
I sent him. I would like a report.

07:59.672 --> 08:02.466
Did he return with a discovery?

08:02.550 --> 08:04.927
He and your brother
learned as much on their trek

08:05.010 --> 08:09.014
as Yusuf did flaying the skin
off the assassin's bones.

08:09.097 --> 08:11.809
- And that is all?
- That is all.

08:13.351 --> 08:15.228
Khutulun awaits your audience.

08:15.312 --> 08:18.816
Hmm. She dressed as
a warrior or a lady?

08:18.899 --> 08:20.108
The former.

08:20.192 --> 08:21.485
(Kublai laughs)

08:21.569 --> 08:22.945
I love that girl.

08:23.028 --> 08:25.948
(Grunts)
No, no, no, no.

08:31.787 --> 08:35.541
- Are you aggrieved, Jingim?
- I am fine, Mother.

08:35.624 --> 08:37.585
Then be fine.

08:39.794 --> 08:43.048
Spirits high for our Khan
and our kingdom.

08:43.131 --> 08:46.384
Let us find resolution
before the White Moon.

08:50.973 --> 08:52.850
I come here, Khagan...

08:52.933 --> 08:56.562
as emissary for my father,
Kaidu of Karakorum.

08:56.645 --> 08:59.272
You are welcome, Khutulun. Rise.

09:02.485 --> 09:05.028
Sire... we were pained to hear

09:05.112 --> 09:07.990
of the cowardly assault
on the Great Khan's person.

09:08.073 --> 09:11.869
It is my father's request
and my wish...

09:11.952 --> 09:14.037
that I remain with my horsemen
in Cambulac

09:14.121 --> 09:16.248
as protector of the Great Khan.

09:18.208 --> 09:21.920
Kaidu seeks to ensure your safety.

09:22.004 --> 09:24.632
I'm your servant.

09:24.715 --> 09:27.134
(Kublai)
I have ample protection.

09:27.217 --> 09:29.302
But I welcome your presence.

09:29.386 --> 09:33.932
I accept your horse,
your sword, your spirit.

09:34.016 --> 09:35.142
You are home.

09:35.225 --> 09:38.521
We're deeply honored, my child.

09:38.604 --> 09:40.022
I invite you to rest...

09:40.105 --> 09:42.274
then join me
and the ladies of the court.

09:42.357 --> 09:45.235
I require no rest, Lady Chabi.

09:45.318 --> 09:47.195
Lead and I will follow.

09:48.446 --> 09:50.157
(Both laughing)

09:51.158 --> 09:52.367
We tour Cambulac

09:52.450 --> 09:55.579
in preparation for
the Festival of the White Moon.

09:58.123 --> 10:00.793
You will accompany us.

10:00.876 --> 10:04.379
I am... deeply honored.

10:22.731 --> 10:24.983
A word with you, Blue Princess.

10:31.489 --> 10:33.617
Why did you not listen to me?

10:33.701 --> 10:35.994
Why did you not
run from this place?

10:36.078 --> 10:39.623
I want to know why you
ride the grasslands alone at night.

10:39.707 --> 10:43.001
I want to know who you
leave the stones for and why.

10:43.085 --> 10:44.920
That is none of your concern.

10:47.172 --> 10:49.675
I cannot protect you
if you do not talk to me.

10:51.134 --> 10:52.970
(Sighs)

10:53.053 --> 10:55.430
Marco... I planted the serpent.

10:57.265 --> 10:59.309
I did not know it was you.

11:01.311 --> 11:03.856
I fear discovery.

11:03.939 --> 11:05.023
Of what?

11:05.107 --> 11:08.526
Tulga... the man you confronted.

11:08.611 --> 11:10.237
He is a survivor of the Bayaut.

11:12.114 --> 11:14.366
- He's your subject?
- Was.

11:14.449 --> 11:17.535
- Does Za Bing know?
- That is why he allows my rides.

11:17.620 --> 11:19.287
And abdicates his duty.

11:19.371 --> 11:21.749
I forbid him from handling the gems.

11:21.832 --> 11:24.584
I will not compromise my friend.

11:26.754 --> 11:29.422
I will carry the gems from now on.

11:29.506 --> 11:33.260
You wish not to
compromise your friend?

11:33.343 --> 11:36.847
Imagine what would happen to him
should you go missing now.

12:14.592 --> 12:16.970
(Jingim)
Good New Year to you, brother.

12:17.054 --> 12:20.390
(Byamba) I worry when you call me
"brother" instead of "bastard."

12:20.473 --> 12:23.476
- It precedes a request.
- (Jingim chuckles)

12:23.560 --> 12:25.312
I need not request.

12:25.395 --> 12:26.479
I order.

12:26.897 --> 12:29.441
I await your command, Jingim Khan.

12:31.819 --> 12:33.696
What news from Eagle's Teaching?

12:33.779 --> 12:36.573
- (Sighs) None to speak of.
- None...

12:36.656 --> 12:38.241
or none you will speak of?

12:39.284 --> 12:40.285
None.

12:40.368 --> 12:43.413
We're talking about my father.

12:43.496 --> 12:45.332
I will know what danger he faces.

12:45.415 --> 12:47.334
(Byamba)
Our father.

12:47.417 --> 12:50.253
I share news of danger
with him alone.

12:50.337 --> 12:51.463
I disclose to the Khan.

12:51.546 --> 12:53.465
It is for the Khan
to report to the Prince.

12:53.548 --> 12:55.718
That is the order of things.

12:55.801 --> 12:58.678
You want to know about Eagle's Teaching,
ask Father, brother.

12:58.762 --> 13:02.140
If you know something...
the burden is on you to defend him.

13:02.224 --> 13:04.517
And I will... with my life.

13:04.601 --> 13:09.022
And if something happens to our father...
I will be the one to take it.

13:16.739 --> 13:18.531
What did Jingim want of you?

13:18.615 --> 13:21.869
Amends made
before the White Moon.

13:43.098 --> 13:46.226
There are no answers here,
Byamba, only pain.

13:46.309 --> 13:49.021
The most important answer may lie within.

13:49.104 --> 13:52.816
We must confirm it
to understand our next steps.

13:52.900 --> 13:55.735
(Marco)
Sanga's family has lost everything.

13:55.819 --> 13:57.946
Get... Get...

13:58.030 --> 14:01.784
(Goland speaking Mandarin)

14:10.292 --> 14:12.127
Stay if you wish.

14:15.422 --> 14:17.883
(Boy speaking Mandarin)

14:17.966 --> 14:19.592
(Knocking on door)

14:23.096 --> 14:24.514
- (Boy greeting in Mandarin)
- (Marco speaking Mandarin)

14:25.766 --> 14:27.517
(Speaking English)
Can I see your mother?

14:35.442 --> 14:36.484
(Spits)

14:36.568 --> 14:38.611
(Goland speaking English)
White devil.

14:38.695 --> 14:41.949
Urla, come! Take the children.

14:48.330 --> 14:50.290
(Boy speaking Mandarin)

14:51.416 --> 14:52.793
My condolences.

14:52.876 --> 14:54.419
(Goland)
Forty days, Latin.

14:54.502 --> 14:56.713
Forty days is the mourning period.

14:56.797 --> 14:58.548
Too late.

14:58.631 --> 15:01.051
I was away at war.

15:01.134 --> 15:03.220
That was some time ago,
Master Polo.

15:03.303 --> 15:05.263
Find a better reason
for your absence.

15:06.264 --> 15:08.183
(Marco)
I have none.

15:09.977 --> 15:13.981
Goland, I'm sorry for
what happened to Sanga.

15:14.064 --> 15:18.110
More sorry for
what I'm about to ask.

15:18.193 --> 15:21.154
Did Sanga ever travel to Kochkor?

15:21.238 --> 15:24.324
(Goland) Do you suspect a dead man
of another crime?

15:24.407 --> 15:26.159
You wish to resurrect him, Christian?

15:26.243 --> 15:27.535
Crucify him once more?

15:27.619 --> 15:29.872
(Marco)
He stole and he was punished for it.

15:29.955 --> 15:32.582
I did not sentence him...

15:32.665 --> 15:34.459
and I did not kill him, Goland.

15:34.542 --> 15:38.005
And my husband did not
send himself to Kochkor.

15:39.214 --> 15:41.091
But he did go?

15:42.675 --> 15:45.220
(Goland)
He collected taxes.

15:45.303 --> 15:48.806
Every second fortnight, he rode.

15:48.891 --> 15:51.476
My husband was
an honorable man.

15:51.559 --> 15:54.021
Question the man
who sent Sanga to Kochkor

15:54.104 --> 15:56.106
before you question that.

16:04.739 --> 16:06.950
Leave us...

16:07.034 --> 16:08.826
please.

16:21.381 --> 16:25.718
(Chabi) We distribute 100,000
loaves of bread every month...

16:25.802 --> 16:29.806
goat milk and yak meat when
the Great Khan's herds are fat.

16:29.890 --> 16:33.643
(Khutulun) The people are fortunate
for your grace, My Lady.

16:33.726 --> 16:36.229
(Chabi)
We take care of our wards...

16:36.313 --> 16:39.691
and they revere the Khan
as their father.

16:39.774 --> 16:46.531
Today, they honor us by working tirelessly
to prepare for the White Moon festivities.

16:52.745 --> 16:54.872
Something wrong, Blue Princess?

16:55.916 --> 16:58.460
I was merely observing
the peasants' devotion,

16:58.543 --> 17:01.046
their love for their
royal benefactress.

17:01.129 --> 17:04.465
Do you question
their devotion and their love?

17:04.549 --> 17:07.135
I do not.

17:07.219 --> 17:09.512
Stop.

17:12.765 --> 17:16.979
Does Lady Kokachin wish to speak
on the topic of the common people?

17:17.061 --> 17:20.147
I apologize, Empress,
for speaking when not bid to do so.

17:20.232 --> 17:23.193
Do so... now.

17:26.946 --> 17:30.200
Has Her Lady walked the villages
of Cambulac without her guard?

17:30.283 --> 17:31.826
I have not.

17:35.413 --> 17:39.126
The Empress' perception
of the city is tempered.

17:39.209 --> 17:43.838
The people love the Khan because
he eases their pains, fills their wants...

17:43.921 --> 17:48.468
but the cause of those pains and wants
is never permanently stamped out.

17:48.551 --> 17:50.470
That can breed resentment.

17:50.553 --> 17:55.267
Did you resolve such matters differently
when your family held power...

17:55.350 --> 17:57.727
Blue Princess of Bayaut?

17:57.810 --> 18:00.105
(Breathes deeply)

18:00.188 --> 18:05.568
My relations with our people, Lady Chabi,
were somewhat more direct.

18:05.652 --> 18:07.529
Is that so?

18:10.157 --> 18:12.034
I mean no offense...

18:12.117 --> 18:14.286
but the Great Khan should
know the minds of his people

18:14.369 --> 18:17.330
before he walks
among them tomorrow.

18:17.414 --> 18:20.208
The Khagan has
my sword and my shield.

18:20.292 --> 18:23.503
I will meet minds
with metal, My Lady.

18:23.586 --> 18:26.381
The Great Khan is secure.

18:42.605 --> 18:45.233
Is the pain bad today, child?

18:48.903 --> 18:51.573
The child suffers, Chancellor.

18:53.491 --> 18:54.701
As do we all...

18:54.784 --> 18:58.205
but seeming cruelty
can bring beauty.

18:58.288 --> 19:01.208
Pain purifies and leads to peace.

19:01.291 --> 19:03.960
These are lessons my sister
taught me when I was a boy.

19:04.044 --> 19:06.003
The girl is too old for binding.

19:06.088 --> 19:10.925
We would have started at an earlier age
were that her father's want.

19:11.008 --> 19:13.345
The Emperor's gone.

19:13.428 --> 19:16.348
I am her uncle.

19:16.431 --> 19:17.849
It is my want.

19:19.892 --> 19:23.396
'Tis a powerful man
who injures little children.

19:27.900 --> 19:30.987
I miss my mother.

19:33.448 --> 19:36.033
We all do, Sunflower...

19:36.118 --> 19:38.953
but I've arranged
to speed her journey.

19:39.036 --> 19:41.456
Now... look away, child.

19:43.291 --> 19:46.043
- (Ling Ling whimpering)
- (Tightening bandages)

19:57.222 --> 19:59.849
Are you mad?

19:59.932 --> 20:03.270
Never contact me.
You will get us both killed.

20:06.898 --> 20:09.276
Out. Now.

20:11.528 --> 20:13.863
Why are you here?

20:15.282 --> 20:19.327
Jia Sidao took me into the palace...
after you left.

20:19.411 --> 20:20.620
He sent me.

20:23.290 --> 20:25.500
He has new orders, Mei Lin.

20:35.343 --> 20:38.430
I am to stay until
this mission is complete.

20:39.347 --> 20:41.683
Sidao offers this.

20:41.766 --> 20:43.226
Tiger root.

20:43.310 --> 20:46.729
Safe to the touch, but if ingested,
it's enough to fell a horse.

20:48.690 --> 20:50.817
This message says nothing of my daughter.

20:56.448 --> 20:58.074
Speak.

20:59.909 --> 21:01.453
He bound her.

21:10.545 --> 21:13.256
He will do worse if you fail.

21:13.340 --> 21:14.757
An assassination?

21:16.343 --> 21:19.346
What he asks of me is impossible.

21:33.235 --> 21:35.403
(Ahmad) What else did you find
in Eagle's Teaching...

21:35.487 --> 21:37.364
besides impure gold?

21:37.447 --> 21:40.450
We found evidence that
Sanga hired the Hashshashin.

21:40.533 --> 21:42.744
He didn't choose to go.
He was sent.

21:43.745 --> 21:46.498
(Marco) We thought you might
offer guidance.

21:46.581 --> 21:48.958
Because he worked for me?

21:49.041 --> 21:51.168
Sanga worked for many.

21:51.253 --> 21:53.671
From Cambulac to...

21:53.755 --> 21:56.090
yes, Kochkor.

21:56.173 --> 21:58.468
The Hashshashin
deal in more than death...

21:58.551 --> 22:03.265
black market trade,
silk, coin, salt...

22:03.348 --> 22:05.892
and currencies
I do not countenance.

22:05.975 --> 22:07.769
Opium, hashish.

22:07.852 --> 22:10.104
You suspected and did nothing?

22:10.187 --> 22:13.400
I cannot eliminate corruption...
and I will not condemn without proof.

22:13.483 --> 22:17.779
If Sanga were running black market goods
throughout the realm, he'd need agents...

22:17.862 --> 22:21.032
soldiers, horsemen... imperial guard.

22:21.115 --> 22:23.410
You have seen my soldiers.

22:23.493 --> 22:25.328
They toil before the abacus.

22:25.412 --> 22:27.872
I certainly do not command
the imperial guard.

22:28.790 --> 22:31.626
That's Vice Regent Yusuf's domain.

22:36.839 --> 22:38.466
I simply state fact.

22:38.550 --> 22:40.552
Thank you, Ahmad.

22:42.219 --> 22:44.514
Why did you finally report Sanga?

22:44.597 --> 22:47.141
You reported
his transgressions to me.

22:47.224 --> 22:50.603
Had I not, it would have been
you or I unjustly trampled in the dirt.

22:59.529 --> 23:02.365
(Jia Sidao) How do preparations
for the boy's coronation fare?

23:02.449 --> 23:04.951
I trust seating arrangements
are managed?

23:05.034 --> 23:07.119
No awkward pairings?

23:07.704 --> 23:10.915
Lord Li cannot tolerate
Prelate Chan.

23:16.212 --> 23:18.297
(Empress Dowager)
Leave us, please...

23:18.381 --> 23:19.674
everyone.

23:32.770 --> 23:35.982
The Dynastic Council
has chosen to dismiss you, Sidao.

23:36.941 --> 23:39.276
We appreciate your service
to the Emperor...

23:39.361 --> 23:41.904
but it is time for you to step down.

23:46.576 --> 23:48.536
Have you anything to say?

23:48.620 --> 23:51.789
You have no authority.

23:51.873 --> 23:55.627
You are an old woman
with a dead husband and no power.

23:55.710 --> 23:57.962
You have nothing.

23:59.381 --> 24:00.840
(Empress Dowager)
I have a champion.

24:03.885 --> 24:06.721
Do you know Fang Zhen
of the Red Lotus Society?

24:06.804 --> 24:08.640
By reputation.

24:08.723 --> 24:09.974
A peasant farmer.

24:10.057 --> 24:13.102
A scholar- warrior
of the highest order...

24:13.185 --> 24:16.773
a Song dynasty loyalist...
a hero, Sidao.

24:16.856 --> 24:18.941
Because he was poor...

24:19.025 --> 24:20.818
a man of the people.

24:22.111 --> 24:24.321
He is not me.

24:25.823 --> 24:30.537
I shepherded this city, this empire
through a time of tumult...

24:30.620 --> 24:33.122
and that time has not passed.

24:33.205 --> 24:34.416
The Mongols will return.

24:34.499 --> 24:37.794
If they return,
they will settle terms of peace...

24:37.877 --> 24:40.212
and negotiate
those terms with him.

24:50.640 --> 24:55.227
Welcome... to the fortress...
Fang Zhen.

24:56.145 --> 24:58.022
Chancellor.

25:00.399 --> 25:02.318
Empress...

25:02.401 --> 25:04.821
I have been too long away.

25:10.201 --> 25:12.912
Take your pets
and your porcelain, Sidao...

25:12.995 --> 25:15.457
and return to the rice paddies.

25:31.138 --> 25:34.726
(Praying in Arabic)

25:36.227 --> 25:37.562
(Knocking on door)

25:38.813 --> 25:42.024
(Speaking English) It is poor form
to disturb a man at prayer.

25:42.108 --> 25:46.821
(Byamba) We are here on the orders of
the Khan, Vice Regent... not your God.

25:48.197 --> 25:50.742
A serious matter.

25:52.952 --> 25:57.414
We apologize for the disturbance...
but the Khan has entrusted us.

25:59.208 --> 26:01.878
Do you remember Sanga,
the collector of taxes?

26:02.587 --> 26:05.464
He was executed on your orders.

26:05.548 --> 26:08.635
My father and uncle
committed a similar crime.

26:08.718 --> 26:09.969
They were branded.

26:12.429 --> 26:15.016
My Khan favors you, Marco...

26:15.099 --> 26:18.019
thus spared your father and uncle.

26:18.102 --> 26:20.062
That was his choice, not mine.

26:20.146 --> 26:22.857
But the Khan had no hand
in Sanga's end.

26:22.940 --> 26:25.442
Respectfully,
death was your decree.

26:25.527 --> 26:28.946
You could have branded his palm,
severed his hand, taken an eye.

26:29.030 --> 26:30.990
I could do these things to you

26:31.073 --> 26:33.325
for challenging the dictates
of the Vice Regent.

26:34.619 --> 26:36.162
We think...

26:37.454 --> 26:40.583
We think Sanga was sent
to Eagle's Teaching...

26:40.667 --> 26:43.044
a proxy for a greater power...

26:43.127 --> 26:47.799
the agent who delivered instructions
for the murder of the Khan.

26:47.882 --> 26:51.510
And you suspect
Sanga was my proxy?

26:51.594 --> 26:55.181
In the absence of the Khan,
the Vice Regent would control Cambulac.

26:55.264 --> 26:59.476
This is true until the Kurultai
elected the next Khan of Khans.

27:00.770 --> 27:02.063
What motive have I, then?

27:02.146 --> 27:06.483
Vice Regent, we do not accuse.
We seek advice.

27:06.568 --> 27:08.069
The Great Lord trusts you.

27:08.152 --> 27:10.613
He does, Master Marco.

27:10.697 --> 27:13.199
I am trusted...

27:13.282 --> 27:14.951
because I lack ambition.

27:15.034 --> 27:19.997
I desire no... riches...
so I'm incorruptible.

27:21.290 --> 27:23.500
I have no blood claim to the throne,

27:23.585 --> 27:27.046
so there is nothing
to which I may ascend.

27:28.673 --> 27:31.550
I am a servant
who has but one function.

27:31.634 --> 27:32.885
Which is?

27:32.969 --> 27:36.222
I speak truth.

27:36.305 --> 27:39.976
It is this respect I show my Khan.

27:40.893 --> 27:44.021
My days are driven by this alone.

27:44.105 --> 27:47.566
"How do I best serve
Kublai and his kingdom?"

27:48.484 --> 27:53.322
There is... clarity in service...

27:53.405 --> 27:57.368
but you... lack this.

28:00.955 --> 28:03.415
Yet here we are.

28:04.541 --> 28:06.543
Yet here we are.

28:09.546 --> 28:14.802
But with what true purpose...
does the Khan send you?

28:14.886 --> 28:17.847
How will you earn his trust?

28:19.431 --> 28:22.184
Think on that
as you take your leave.

28:24.646 --> 28:27.148
(Praying in Arabic)

28:41.871 --> 28:45.041
Is my father safe?

28:45.124 --> 28:47.919
(Ahmad) Why ask me, Jingim?
Did you ask our father?

28:48.002 --> 28:50.254
(Sighs)
I did.

28:51.798 --> 28:53.590
He trusts Byamba.

28:53.675 --> 28:57.094
He trusts the Latin
and offers me silence.

28:57.178 --> 29:00.306
(Ahmad) Whatever they found in Kochkor
was of no consequence.

29:00.389 --> 29:02.099
He doesn't want to
burden you with trivialities.

29:02.183 --> 29:04.310
He doesn't trust me with the truth.

29:04.393 --> 29:06.520
And what would you
do with it, Jingim?

29:06.603 --> 29:10.983
What would you do
if you had a target for your rage?

29:11.901 --> 29:14.403
I would let my Mongol heart guide me.

29:14.486 --> 29:15.487
I would kill!

29:15.571 --> 29:18.115
The Great Khan knows this.

29:18.199 --> 29:19.826
If there is some truth
to hold from you,

29:19.909 --> 29:22.328
he does so because
he knows your heart.

29:23.746 --> 29:26.082
Let your father protect you.

29:27.083 --> 29:30.419
Let me, your brother, protect you...

29:30.502 --> 29:32.839
until we find a true target.

30:01.158 --> 30:02.326
Untrue by an inch.

30:02.409 --> 30:06.580
Untrue by an inch,
untrue by a mile.

30:06.663 --> 30:10.542
It is in the split moment when
all four hooves leave the ground.

30:10.626 --> 30:13.045
Breathe and send.

30:13.713 --> 30:17.549
When you first arrived,
you had too little yin, too much yang.

30:19.844 --> 30:24.181
And now, too much yin...
not enough...

30:29.937 --> 30:31.814
Not so simple.

30:31.898 --> 30:34.776
Do not strive for the center.

30:34.859 --> 30:39.989
Just breathe...
with your horse... and your arrow.

30:49.957 --> 30:51.625
(Sighs)

30:52.877 --> 30:54.628
The Khan expects an answer.

30:54.711 --> 30:56.713
What answer to give?

30:56.798 --> 30:59.050
The cripple, Yusuf,
is beyond reproach.

30:59.133 --> 31:00.885
Yusuf hides behind his words.

31:00.968 --> 31:02.845
Is that what you'll report?

31:10.727 --> 31:13.647
Untrue by an inch...

31:13.730 --> 31:16.650
untrue by a mile.

31:35.627 --> 31:37.754
I have no story to tell, Sire.

31:37.839 --> 31:40.466
I believe my friend, Sanga,
traveled to Kochkor...

31:40.549 --> 31:43.219
but I do not know
on whose command... if anyone's.

31:43.302 --> 31:45.972
What are your suspicions?

31:47.473 --> 31:49.391
I must say nothing...

31:49.475 --> 31:52.478
for fear that I may
condemn an innocent.

31:54.105 --> 31:57.691
All I know...
is someone seeks your head.

31:57.774 --> 31:59.610
(Scoffs)

31:59.693 --> 32:01.988
Many do, Latin.

32:03.990 --> 32:07.994
But my children have been
spared sight of me far too long.

32:09.203 --> 32:11.788
Take your leave.

32:11.873 --> 32:14.791
Your children want you alive, Sire.

32:26.678 --> 32:27.721
(Door closes)

32:27.804 --> 32:30.432
Do you still suspect him?

32:34.478 --> 32:40.151
A weaker man would surrender a name
to deflect suspicion from himself.

32:40.234 --> 32:42.736
As would a man
burdened with guilt.

32:42.819 --> 32:45.531
I believe him to be neither.

32:45.614 --> 32:48.367
The boy has changed greatly
since coming to us.

32:48.450 --> 32:52.163
He did not come to us, Sire.
He was left...

32:52.246 --> 32:54.165
A fact that bears recall.

32:54.248 --> 32:55.541
(Chuckles)

32:55.624 --> 32:58.502
You suspect the Latin's father?

32:59.545 --> 33:03.966
Did he abandon his son
to serve his purse... or his pope?

33:04.050 --> 33:06.593
So, what course of action tomorrow?

33:07.511 --> 33:11.265
We have detained and questioned
your guards and staff.

33:11.348 --> 33:14.143
I believe them innocent.

33:17.479 --> 33:20.441
My suspicion of Marco has waned...

33:20.524 --> 33:26.197
but for now, to be safe...
those whom lack your trust... kill.

33:28.282 --> 33:31.618
There would be few left living
if I heed that counsel.

33:32.869 --> 33:34.455
Should I trust you, Yusuf?

33:41.545 --> 33:42.964
Hmm?

33:44.881 --> 33:47.301
We will play another time.

34:01.857 --> 34:03.900
(Indistinct conversations)

34:51.364 --> 34:52.949
(Byamba grunting)

35:01.583 --> 35:03.877
(Khutulun)
Where's your European playmate?

35:10.384 --> 35:12.969
He's an innocent
in this world, isn't he?

35:13.054 --> 35:14.555
And you and I are not?

35:14.638 --> 35:17.808
No... we are warriors.

35:19.685 --> 35:23.022
I fear our world strips him
of what innocence still remains.

35:26.108 --> 35:28.777
Then we do him a favor.

35:28.860 --> 35:32.323
The world is not kind to
the weak and the guileless.

35:36.327 --> 35:37.828
Would you like to wrestle me?

35:38.829 --> 35:42.374
There are no witnesses,
save Tengri.

35:42.458 --> 35:44.335
Do you think
you can beat me?

35:44.418 --> 35:46.128
I think you wish me to.

35:48.004 --> 35:49.298
Not today.

35:49.381 --> 35:50.591
Are you afraid?

35:51.133 --> 35:54.636
I simply hear the blade's song right now.

36:05.021 --> 36:06.273
(Women giggling)

36:06.357 --> 36:07.399
(Kublai growling)

36:07.483 --> 36:09.651
Where you go?

36:17.951 --> 36:19.286
(Kublai growling)

36:19.370 --> 36:21.247
Where are you going?

37:07.083 --> 37:08.210
Come.

37:54.548 --> 37:57.050
If it pleases the Khan.

37:58.552 --> 38:00.762
(Kublai chuckling)

38:02.848 --> 38:05.392
If it pleases the Queen.
Hmm?

38:13.942 --> 38:16.862
(Whispers)
It does not please the Queen.

38:30.792 --> 38:32.628
(Women sobbing)

38:39.385 --> 38:43.096
(Ahmad) Pitiable event
on this blessed day of Tsagaan Sar.

39:00.155 --> 39:01.948
(Inhaling)

39:04.826 --> 39:07.913
It seems life has left her too soon.

39:14.002 --> 39:17.005
The Khan's consorts must not cry.

39:19.300 --> 39:21.635
It clouds the eyes
and ruddies the complexion.

39:21.718 --> 39:22.803
Death is life.

39:22.886 --> 39:25.847
Now is not the time for tears.

39:36.733 --> 39:39.570
(Fang Zhen) Will you return to
your village, Chancellor?

39:39.653 --> 39:41.780
(Jia Sidao) I was too grand for it
when I was part of it.

39:41.863 --> 39:44.533
I've grown grander since.

39:44.616 --> 39:47.035
I have been an admirer of yours...

39:47.118 --> 39:50.497
from afar... from the battlefield.

39:50.581 --> 39:54.835
You have been an annoying thorn in
Kublai's side for many years, Fang Zhen,

39:54.918 --> 39:58.339
frightening his tax collectors,
burning his crops,

39:58.422 --> 40:00.507
storing weapons
in loyalist settlements,

40:00.591 --> 40:03.344
settlements that bear the brunt
of the Khan's brutality

40:03.427 --> 40:04.761
after you've moved on.

40:05.679 --> 40:07.848
I've long admired you as well.

40:08.474 --> 40:10.016
I tire of warfare.

40:10.100 --> 40:13.395
Before or after Empress Dowager
offered you my title?

40:13.895 --> 40:17.691
War is pointless.
It never ends.

40:17.774 --> 40:21.487
Yes... the warrior
who rejects war.

40:22.654 --> 40:24.615
Empress is more intelligent
than I suspected.

40:24.698 --> 40:26.116
You... more foolish.

40:26.199 --> 40:31.747
We are like- minded, Chancellor...
in our need to defend Xiangyang.

40:31.830 --> 40:34.833
I will do so until my final breath.

40:34.916 --> 40:37.127
Peace is possible...

40:37.210 --> 40:41.715
and it begins, Jia Sidao...
with our peaceful transition.

40:52.267 --> 40:53.852
(Kublai grunts)

40:57.313 --> 40:59.733
Is it time?

40:59.816 --> 41:01.652
It is, Father...

41:05.864 --> 41:09.242
but I did not advise
your attendance.

41:09.325 --> 41:12.954
What can be done
has been done, Jingim.

41:14.415 --> 41:16.625
You worry like your mother.

41:16.708 --> 41:19.294
Vice Regent Yusuf himself
concurs with me.

41:21.212 --> 41:24.675
Yusuf is worse than your mother.

41:24.758 --> 41:28.679
We do not yet know
who conspired against Your Greatness.

41:28.762 --> 41:31.473
Rumor breeds fear.

41:31.557 --> 41:35.602
My people do not know if
blood courses through my veins...

41:35.686 --> 41:40.273
or if my body rests with Genghis
in Burkhan Khaldun.

41:43.151 --> 41:45.195
I must show them their Khan.

41:46.279 --> 41:48.990
You are concerned
you are seen as weak.

41:49.991 --> 41:51.326
Mmm.

41:56.665 --> 42:00.043
I cannot afford to
bolster these perceptions.

42:00.126 --> 42:02.754
There is no question, Father.

42:02.838 --> 42:05.591
You slayed Ariq single- handedly.

42:06.883 --> 42:09.928
Why was that necessary?

42:10.011 --> 42:12.347
Why did my brother challenge me?

42:14.182 --> 42:17.185
He saw me as weak.

42:17.268 --> 42:21.106
Despite what I did...
people still...

42:21.189 --> 42:24.400
rumor of my decline...

42:24.485 --> 42:26.152
and they worry for succession.

42:26.236 --> 42:30.198
- The line is clear.
- But not guaranteed, Jingim.

42:31.825 --> 42:36.580
You will be opposed at the Kurultai
when the time comes.

42:36.663 --> 42:40.333
Kaidu... Nayan...

42:40.416 --> 42:42.919
many feel entitled to my throne.

42:43.003 --> 42:45.881
The throne is mine
and I will ascend to it.

42:45.964 --> 42:48.634
There is nothing I desire
more than this.

42:50.218 --> 42:52.137
But you fear I will fail.

42:52.220 --> 42:55.140
You must prove yourself
to the Khanate.

42:55.223 --> 42:59.060
Until you do...
until you silence all doubters...

42:59.144 --> 43:00.436
I must be strong.

43:03.899 --> 43:06.359
And so today...
you risk yourself?

43:09.530 --> 43:11.865
I fulfill my duty.

43:13.909 --> 43:16.787
Rally my people.

43:18.955 --> 43:21.958
To inspire your strength.

43:23.919 --> 43:25.629
Am I such a burden?

43:29.758 --> 43:31.342
You're my son.

43:47.067 --> 43:51.863
(Children laughing)

43:56.159 --> 43:58.328
Tulga...

43:58.411 --> 44:00.664
I spoke to Kokachin.

44:00.747 --> 44:03.584
I did not come to hurt you.
I came to help you.

44:04.250 --> 44:05.794
You lie.

44:05.877 --> 44:07.337
I know who you are.

44:07.420 --> 44:11.842
One of the Bayaut...
a survivor of the massacre.

44:14.135 --> 44:15.303
I know she protects you.

44:15.386 --> 44:17.138
I protect her.

44:17.222 --> 44:18.932
No more.

44:19.015 --> 44:21.643
If I found you,
someone else will find you.

44:21.727 --> 44:24.312
It will be your undoing and hers.

44:24.395 --> 44:25.689
You risk the Princess.

44:25.772 --> 44:27.482
The Princess is all I have.

44:30.026 --> 44:31.111
You love her.

44:31.194 --> 44:33.947
There was an arrangement... long ago.

44:34.030 --> 44:35.448
We are to be together.

44:43.164 --> 44:46.126
I will bring you the stones.
You will not see Kokachin.

44:48.336 --> 44:50.631
But you will live.

44:54.550 --> 44:57.220
- (Drumming)
- (Villagers chanting)

45:01.474 --> 45:05.186
(Jingim) All bow down
and worship at once your Lord.

45:07.063 --> 45:11.693
God save and keep our Lord long
with joy and gladness.

45:13.361 --> 45:16.489
Long live the Khan of Khans!

45:18.533 --> 45:21.077
(Drumroll)

45:56.196 --> 45:58.364
Urla.

45:58.448 --> 46:02.243
No line up for water
on the night of the White Moon.

46:05.121 --> 46:07.958
I'm sorry for what happened
to your father.

46:09.918 --> 46:13.046
As you said,
you did not sentence him...

46:13.129 --> 46:15.841
and if he was a thief,
he was deserving of punishment.

46:16.758 --> 46:18.551
Sanga was a good man.

46:19.469 --> 46:22.347
What do you think he did?

46:22.430 --> 46:24.766
What was it Ahmad sent him to do?

46:24.850 --> 46:26.309
I cannot answer that.

46:26.392 --> 46:28.895
Never again breathe that suspicion.

46:28.979 --> 46:32.899
For your family's sake... never.

46:39.280 --> 46:41.199
Move on.

46:41.282 --> 46:44.535
Help your family
to find a future without him.

46:54.045 --> 46:55.713
(Rhythmic drumming)

47:16.777 --> 47:19.112
The bracelet is delivered.

47:21.072 --> 47:23.074
I am most grateful.

47:23.158 --> 47:25.118
I will repay your gesture
in the future.

47:25.201 --> 47:29.372
You can repay it now...
with the answer to a question.

47:29.455 --> 47:32.375
How is it that a peasant
weds a princess?

47:36.379 --> 47:39.507
No royal marries
beneath their station.

47:39.590 --> 47:42.427
Then Tulga is delusional?

47:44.095 --> 47:48.058
I could not be with Tulga, Master Marco,
any more than I could be with you.

47:48.141 --> 47:51.061
You avoid a direct answer
to my question, Blue Princess.

47:55.356 --> 47:57.901
Silence is no shield, Kokachin.

47:57.984 --> 48:00.361
If you expect me to deliver
the gems to your subject,

48:00.445 --> 48:02.780
I need to know
if that subject is mad.

48:06.701 --> 48:08.703
He is not.

48:10.997 --> 48:13.291
Then there are nuptials
to be arranged.

48:13.374 --> 48:14.835
Is the Khan aware?

48:17.045 --> 48:18.463
You lack humor, Latin.

48:18.546 --> 48:20.465
I intend none.

48:21.842 --> 48:23.593
I am deceived.

48:29.850 --> 48:34.896
It is time for Jingim
to take a new wife, I think.

48:34.980 --> 48:37.983
A more fertile bitch, I hope.

48:38.066 --> 48:41.486
- The rest are barren as my Gobi.
- (Chuckles)

48:41.569 --> 48:44.990
I trust you have
someone in mind?

48:47.450 --> 48:49.369
(People cheering)

49:56.144 --> 49:58.146
Stop!

49:59.189 --> 50:00.648
(People exclaiming)

50:09.449 --> 50:11.159
(Choking)

50:12.827 --> 50:14.829
(People screaming)

50:37.393 --> 50:38.561
(Soldier grunting)

51:07.465 --> 51:09.425
(Gasping)

51:09.509 --> 51:11.386
(Soldiers shouting)

51:17.642 --> 51:18.851
(Grunts)

51:18.934 --> 51:21.437
(Wailing)
