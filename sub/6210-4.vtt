We read you,

00:08.073 --> 00:09.441
Notice anything different?

00:09.442 --> 00:10.575
You threw up on the sofa?

00:10.576 --> 00:12.310
I said "different."

00:12.311 --> 00:13.778
It's the clock on the VCR.

00:13.779 --> 00:15.012
I programmed it.

00:15.013 --> 00:17.349
It's not blinking 12 anymore.

00:17.350 --> 00:18.817
Isn't that great?

00:18.818 --> 00:21.786
Yeah, that's what I'd call
it if I were being sarcastic.

00:21.787 --> 00:23.688
I didn't know we had
a clock on the VCR.

00:23.689 --> 00:26.190
We could have fixed it ourselves
if we wanted to.

00:26.191 --> 00:27.558
We're witches.

00:27.559 --> 00:29.027
You dames are just bitter

00:29.028 --> 00:30.461
because I'm the man
of the house,

00:30.462 --> 00:32.530
and I know how to do
the manly stuff.

00:32.531 --> 00:33.798
Oh. Well, you certainly have

00:33.799 --> 00:35.466
the scratching yourself
part down.

00:35.467 --> 00:38.236
If you really want
to impress us,

00:38.237 --> 00:40.238
program this.

00:42.041 --> 00:44.009
I didn't know we had a clock
on our scoreboard.

Mr. Can Opener,
meet your worst nightmare:

Mr. Screwdriver.

01:27.786 --> 01:29.988
the mail comes
in little white envelopes.

01:29.989 --> 01:31.756
It's from your cousin Mortimer.

01:31.757 --> 01:33.892
He's coming to help you discover
the family secret.

01:33.893 --> 01:36.728
Sabrina, I should warn you.

01:36.729 --> 01:39.297
Your cousin Mortimer
is a wigician.

01:39.298 --> 01:40.499
A wigician?

01:40.500 --> 01:42.400
A witch who works
as a magician.

01:42.401 --> 01:44.068
How cool.

01:44.970 --> 01:47.506
I mean, how unspeakably tragic.

01:47.507 --> 01:49.840
He was so gifted.

01:49.841 --> 01:51.376
He could have done so much.

01:51.377 --> 01:53.912
Instead he chose
to squander his talents

01:53.913 --> 01:55.647
entertaining gullible mortals.

01:55.648 --> 01:58.783
And the worst part
is he's not even good at it.

02:02.154 --> 02:04.222
( coughing )

02:04.223 --> 02:05.389
Ta-da!

02:05.390 --> 02:07.358
That's magician for "I'm here."

02:07.359 --> 02:10.294
Oh, no, please, you're too kind.
Ha-ha-ha.

02:10.295 --> 02:12.263
This must be Sabrina.

02:12.264 --> 02:13.497
Okay, enough small talk.

02:13.498 --> 02:15.700
Discuss the family secret
and let him be on his way.

02:15.701 --> 02:16.868
He's a very busy man,

02:16.869 --> 02:18.603
and this is cruise season,
after all.

02:18.604 --> 02:19.771
No, there's no rush.

02:19.772 --> 02:21.940
I've got a gig tomorrow night

And...

02:40.693 --> 02:42.194
...a pickle.

A nickel.
It's supposed to be a nickel.

Oh, that's wrong.

to go to the Slicery

away from a free soda.

02:56.509 --> 02:58.610
I can't.
My dad's out of town

02:58.611 --> 03:00.078
and I have to watch
my little brother.

What about your mom?
Is she sick or something?

03:02.347 --> 03:04.983
Very.
She's...pregnant.

Pregnant?

03:08.420 --> 03:11.256
Congratulations,
I guess.

at their advanced age--

Yeah, yeah, I know. I know.

I have an announcement.

03:36.349 --> 03:38.049
There are a few spots open

03:38.050 --> 03:39.851
on the second-string
cheerleading squad.

I know. We haven't had

03:42.722 --> 03:44.756
an opening in years.

03:44.757 --> 03:46.358
Not since the time
Charlene Snyder

03:46.359 --> 03:48.526
developed that puzzling
skin condition.

One zit and:

03:52.598 --> 03:55.299
So if you think
you're better than everyone,

03:55.300 --> 03:57.268
sign up for tryouts.

03:58.704 --> 03:59.838
Hey, Libby,

03:59.839 --> 04:01.138
you looked great out there.

04:01.139 --> 04:03.240
Take your seat.

04:03.241 --> 04:05.676
You know, I think I'm gonna
try out for cheerleading.

04:05.677 --> 04:08.079
Oh, no. You ate your beef

04:08.080 --> 04:10.015
and now your brain
stopped functioning.

you can still comprehend it:

04:12.217 --> 04:13.384
We all love you.

04:14.453 --> 04:16.688
What is wrong with wanting
to be a cheerleader?

04:16.689 --> 04:18.690
Oh, no, we've lost her.

04:18.690 --> 04:22.127
It's eerie. It looks
like she's still with us.

04:22.128 --> 04:24.428
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

I can dismantle this.

04:26.665 --> 04:29.601
is spin my head around
about 33 times.

04:31.270 --> 04:34.873
Or smash it on the floor.

for helping me rehearse.

to hurt at all.

please speak up.

to just sign this release?

a cheerleader.

05:10.076 --> 05:11.576
At least you get to stand up.

05:11.577 --> 05:14.145
It's a known fact that
cheerleaders sleep upside down

Oh, honey, if Valerie
wants to be a cheerleader

05:18.183 --> 05:19.917
you have to let her.

What's the harm
if it makes her happy?

05:21.587 --> 05:23.921
I'm not even gonna dignify
that with a response.

05:24.557 --> 05:26.156
Let me guess.

This is not a good time to ask
you about the family secret?

05:28.227 --> 05:29.560

I have to concentrate
on what I'm doing.

Don't you understand?

I think I left
the back door open.

05:49.014 --> 05:51.949

that walks out.

05:51.950 --> 05:52.917

05:52.918 --> 05:54.786
Anyway, back to Valerie.

about what you said,

06:07.733 --> 06:09.334
but I still want
to be a cheerleader.

06:09.335 --> 06:10.901
I've always wanted
to be a cheerleader.

06:10.902 --> 06:12.069
It just seems like fun.

06:12.070 --> 06:13.238
But why, Valerie?

06:13.239 --> 06:14.238
I mean, you're so smart.

06:14.239 --> 06:15.507
You could do so much more.

06:15.508 --> 06:17.976
You could be on the Chess Club,
or the Astronomy Club,

06:17.977 --> 06:18.943
or the debate team.

06:18.944 --> 06:21.145
Maybe I just want
to be a cheerleader.

06:21.146 --> 06:22.947
Look, you're gonna have
to accept it, okay?

06:22.948 --> 06:24.215
I'm going to try out.

half the night

looking for the right
breast cream for my mom.

06:36.829 --> 06:39.464
Okay, the less we talk
about that subject the better.

06:39.465 --> 06:41.198
You know, this whole
cheerleading thing

06:41.199 --> 06:43.635
is really making me feel like
I don't know Valerie anymore.

06:43.636 --> 06:45.804
I don't see what the harm
is if it makes her happy.

06:45.805 --> 06:48.038
Everybody wants Valerie
to be happy.

06:48.039 --> 06:50.108
Am I the only one
who cares about her?

06:53.179 --> 06:55.046
Oh, so that's why there's been

06:55.047 --> 06:56.381
a busy signal the last hour.

06:56.382 --> 06:57.782
I've been trying
to call my aunts.

06:57.783 --> 06:59.517
You know, when I'm done,
you'll be able

06:59.518 --> 07:01.085
to call anyone,
anytime you want.

07:01.086 --> 07:03.888
You mean, like we already do?

07:03.889 --> 07:08.893
Yes, but my way shocks you
when you hit the seven.

07:08.894 --> 07:10.828
Oh, what perfect timing.

07:10.829 --> 07:12.329
Now you ask me
anything you want

07:12.330 --> 07:13.797
about the family secrets.

07:13.798 --> 07:16.134
No question too big,
no question too small.

07:16.135 --> 07:17.568
Ask me anything you want.

07:17.569 --> 07:19.771
I know everything there
is to know about this family.

07:19.772 --> 07:22.006
Well, I'd really like
to talk about Valerie.

07:22.007 --> 07:23.308
Never heard of her.

07:23.309 --> 07:24.876
Well, she's my best friend

07:24.877 --> 07:26.310
and she wants
to be a cheerleader,

07:26.311 --> 07:27.912
and somehow
I've gotta convince her

07:27.913 --> 07:29.047
that she's making a mistake.

07:29.048 --> 07:31.782
Ah, then here's what you need.

07:31.783 --> 07:33.117
This will help.

07:33.118 --> 07:34.485
( grunts )

07:36.422 --> 07:39.090
A penny? I don't think
Valerie's into bribes.

07:39.091 --> 07:40.892
No, that's not just a penny.

07:40.893 --> 07:43.695
With this penny you can look
right into her mind.

07:43.696 --> 07:46.197
You can tell
what she's thinking.

07:46.198 --> 07:48.733
I already know what she's
thinking and it all rhymes.

07:48.734 --> 07:51.769
With this,
you can manipulate her thoughts.

07:51.770 --> 07:52.837
Ha, ha.

07:52.838 --> 07:54.405
Where did you get
such a cool trick?

07:54.406 --> 07:56.441
That was given to me
by the great Harry Houdini.

07:56.442 --> 08:00.678
All I had to do was promise
never to talk to him again.

08:02.047 --> 08:05.216
( marching band playing )

08:05.217 --> 08:08.286
Val, hi. Look, I'm really sorry
about yesterday.

08:08.287 --> 08:10.021
I shouldn't have tried
to influence you.

08:10.022 --> 08:12.357
Oh, I understand. You only did
it because you care about me.

08:12.358 --> 08:14.959
Exactly.
So here.

08:14.960 --> 08:17.395
Sabrina, you can't
buy my friendship.

08:17.396 --> 08:18.796
Especially for a penny.

08:18.797 --> 08:21.366
No. I learned a magic trick.
Look:

08:24.603 --> 08:26.137
See? Disappeared.

08:26.138 --> 08:28.072
And you put down cheerleading?

08:28.073 --> 08:29.473
Good luck.

08:34.111 --> 08:36.948
Valerie,
this is for your own good.

08:36.948 --> 08:39.350

<i>this last one a doozy.</i>

Next up in our long shot
category, Valerie Birkhead.

09:44.717 --> 09:46.817
Uh, I changed my mind.

09:46.818 --> 09:48.586
I'm not gonna
try out anymore.

09:52.191 --> 09:54.759
Wonder if they give
a Nobel Prize for friendship?

10:01.600 --> 10:03.501
Oh. Morning, cousin Mortimer.

10:03.502 --> 10:05.436
Uh, yeah.
Mortimer, that's right.

10:05.437 --> 10:07.038
It's my agent.

10:07.039 --> 10:09.707
I just wanted to tell you
the penny worked.
Great.

10:09.708 --> 10:11.542
I probably saved Valerie
from a life of crime,

10:11.543 --> 10:12.643
which, as everyone knows,

10:12.644 --> 10:14.312
is what cheerleading
always leads to.

10:14.313 --> 10:16.514
I'm so happy.
What? Are you sure?

10:16.515 --> 10:19.917
Nothing? Not even a grand
opening for a gas station?

10:19.918 --> 10:21.085
Fine.

10:21.086 --> 10:23.220
Anything wrong?

10:23.221 --> 10:26.156
No. No, no, no. They just
canceled my gig at the Y.

10:26.157 --> 10:27.457
They replaced me with K.I.T.T.,

10:27.458 --> 10:29.860
the talking car
from <i>Knight Rider.</i>

10:29.861 --> 10:31.762
I'm sorry. I wish there was
something I could do.

10:31.763 --> 10:33.264
Oh, I know you--
You want to help.

10:33.265 --> 10:34.332
If you would, you could.

10:34.333 --> 10:36.834
But, listen,
I love being a wigician.

10:36.835 --> 10:38.869
I just love it.
The wand, the applause,

10:38.870 --> 10:40.571

scarves,

10:40.572 --> 10:42.539
the second-hand smoke,
I love it!

10:42.540 --> 10:45.309
Well, when you put it that way,
who can blame you?

10:56.020 --> 10:57.221
He's in the freezer

10:57.222 --> 10:59.223
right next to the Eskimo Pies.

11:02.627 --> 11:03.694
Avert your gaze!

11:03.695 --> 11:05.162
I'm working with isotopes.

11:05.163 --> 11:06.864
Salem, when are you planning

11:06.865 --> 11:09.300
to put all this stuff
back together?

11:09.301 --> 11:12.303
Relax. I'm on a journey
of self-discovery.

11:12.304 --> 11:13.671
For instance, I just discovered

11:13.672 --> 11:16.006
that it's really cold
inside the freezer.

11:16.007 --> 11:18.342
My eyes are frozen open.

11:18.343 --> 11:20.545
Cousin Zelda,
let me help you.

11:20.546 --> 11:21.545
No, Mortimer--

11:21.546 --> 11:23.447
I insist, please. Step back.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.055
Ah.

11:33.258 --> 11:35.426
Hilda? Zelda?

11:35.427 --> 11:37.361
Hello?

11:37.362 --> 11:38.362
( sniffs )

11:38.363 --> 11:41.265
Do I smell curry?

11:41.266 --> 11:43.934
I can't believe
you made him disappear.

11:43.935 --> 11:46.403
It has to do with the--
Oh. See? Look.

11:47.939 --> 11:51.141
Trust me, Val.
Orchestra Club is the way to go.

11:51.142 --> 11:52.477
Maybe you're right.

11:52.478 --> 11:54.378
Maybe that's where
my kind belongs:

11:54.379 --> 11:56.280
In the darkest corner
of the orchestra pit

11:56.281 --> 11:57.481
playing the triangle.

11:57.482 --> 11:58.749
That's the spirit.

11:58.750 --> 12:00.751
Now that you won't have
cheerleading practice

12:00.752 --> 12:02.586
every afternoon,
we can do whatever we want.

12:02.587 --> 12:04.822
Go to the mall, and
try on clothes we can't afford--

12:04.823 --> 12:05.889
Take naps.

12:05.890 --> 12:07.457
I'm even willing
to go to that place

12:07.458 --> 12:09.026
where you paint
the plates and cups.

12:09.027 --> 12:10.561
Come on, what do you say?

12:10.562 --> 12:12.830
My mom could use
a new spoon caddy.

12:12.831 --> 12:14.031
This is gonna be great.

12:14.032 --> 12:15.632
You and me doing
everything together,

12:15.633 --> 12:16.800
just like things used to be.

12:16.801 --> 12:18.769
Do you guys have any idea
where I can rent

12:18.770 --> 12:20.237
a Mother Goose
karaoke machine?

12:20.238 --> 12:23.340
Harvey Kinkle, king
of the conversation starters.

12:23.341 --> 12:25.175
My little brother's
birthday party is today,

12:25.176 --> 12:26.844
and I'm in charge
of the entertainment.

12:26.845 --> 12:28.312
What did you get?
Nothing.

12:28.313 --> 12:29.780
I've been so busy
helping my mom

12:29.781 --> 12:31.715
I completely forgot.

12:31.716 --> 12:33.817
My dad is really gonna
lay into me.

12:33.818 --> 12:36.587
I'm telling you, it will be like
the final scene from <i>Braveheart.</i>

12:36.588 --> 12:38.422
Hey,
I've got the perfect idea.

12:38.423 --> 12:40.124
Oh. Maybe it's not
such a good idea.

12:40.125 --> 12:41.859
Please. Anything.

12:41.860 --> 12:44.761
My cousin Mortimer
is a wigici-- Magician,

12:44.762 --> 12:47.564
and, um, he'd be perfect
for your brother's party.

12:47.565 --> 12:49.700
Do you think there's any way
we could possibly get him?

12:49.701 --> 12:52.836
I'm going out on a limb here,
but, um, yes.

12:52.837 --> 12:54.238
Saba--

12:54.239 --> 12:56.040
Ah. Oh.
Oh, try again.

12:56.041 --> 12:58.742
And this time,
try bringing Salem back.

12:58.743 --> 13:01.479
Okay. Crim flim blitz!

13:03.948 --> 13:07.951
Hey, that's how
I met my first wife.

13:07.952 --> 13:10.421
Would you mind taking a seat
with the others, please?

13:12.958 --> 13:16.160
Have I accidentally stumbled
into a Boston Market?

13:16.161 --> 13:17.627
Hey! Great news,
cousin Mortimer,

13:17.628 --> 13:19.163
I got you a gig.

13:19.164 --> 13:21.799
A magic show for Harvey's
little brother and his friends.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.401
All right, after 300 years
of practicing for this

13:24.402 --> 13:26.470
it's finally paying off. Yes.

13:26.471 --> 13:29.506
Sabrina, Mortimer doesn't
have time to do any magic shows.

13:29.507 --> 13:31.542
He's too busy trying
to bring back Salem.

13:31.543 --> 13:33.410
Oh,
but we're getting closer.

13:33.411 --> 13:35.612
He just brought back a guy
waiting for his CAT scan.

13:36.714 --> 13:38.816
And a Catskills comedian.

13:38.817 --> 13:40.184
Everybody comfortable?

13:40.185 --> 13:41.952
I make a nice living.

13:41.953 --> 13:46.390
And Sylvia and Irving Katz
from New Rochelle.

13:46.391 --> 13:48.759
But no Salem.
( groans )

13:48.760 --> 13:51.361
Then how do you explain
Martha Washington?

13:51.362 --> 13:52.763
I don't know.

13:52.764 --> 13:55.832
Besides, I don't think you
really want him around children.

13:55.833 --> 13:57.001
It's too late.

13:57.002 --> 13:58.602
The kids are gonna
be here--

13:58.603 --> 13:59.870
( doorbell rings )
Now.

13:59.871 --> 14:01.038
MORTIMER:
I'm going to put

14:01.039 --> 14:05.209
this delicious piece
of cake-- Mm-mm.

14:05.210 --> 14:08.879
--and put it in my hat.
Ha-ha-ha.

14:08.880 --> 14:10.380
Here it goes.

14:10.381 --> 14:12.116
Say the magic words, children.

14:12.117 --> 14:15.152
ALL:
The magic words!

Oh. Ooh.

14:23.194 --> 14:25.195
Oh, look. Flowers.

14:25.196 --> 14:26.997
And it was a birthday cake.

14:26.998 --> 14:28.833
Thank you. Thank you.

14:28.834 --> 14:30.434
You're too kind.

14:30.435 --> 14:33.737
Please give me a hand
for my assistant, Martha.

14:34.772 --> 14:36.607
Who are you people?

14:36.608 --> 14:38.175
And where's George?

14:38.176 --> 14:40.511
Oh, Sabrina,
I wish you hadn't asked

14:40.512 --> 14:42.112
cousin Mortimer to do this.

14:42.113 --> 14:44.748
You just know something
horrible's gonna happen.

14:44.749 --> 14:47.451
When are you two gonna cut
cousin Mortimer some slack?

14:47.452 --> 14:49.120
He's just doing what he loves.

14:49.121 --> 14:50.954
Not really well,
but he's still doing it.

14:50.955 --> 14:52.356
He could have been
so much more.

14:52.357 --> 14:54.825
He could have been a novelist,
or a chemist, or a professor.

14:54.826 --> 14:56.727
Maybe he doesn't want
to be any of those things.

14:56.728 --> 14:58.295
Maybe he just wants
to be a wigician.

14:58.296 --> 15:01.198
I mean, what's the harm in it
as long as it makes him happy?

15:01.199 --> 15:02.899
Just like Valerie.
Gotta go.

15:02.900 --> 15:04.835
Thank you.
You're so kind.

15:04.836 --> 15:07.504
And now, I need a volunteer.
ALL: Me, me.

15:07.505 --> 15:09.907
A volunteer, a volunteer.
How about you?

15:09.908 --> 15:11.375
The birthday boy.

15:11.376 --> 15:14.011
Does he look old enough
to have dental records?

is a menace to society

to hear from my lawyer.

Cat. Talk.

Oh, my career go bye-bye.

15:41.706 --> 15:44.241
Okay. Up until now every trick
kind of stunk,

15:44.242 --> 15:45.542
but that was great.

15:45.543 --> 15:47.110
ALL:
Yeah.

Listen, could you vamp
till I try to find the kid?

has astounded even himself.

Listen, kid,
you don't have to mention this

16:16.441 --> 16:18.509
to your parents, okay?
Here. Go.

16:20.478 --> 16:22.479
Val, I really blew it on this
cheerleader thing.

16:22.480 --> 16:24.615
If there's something out there
that makes you happy,

16:24.616 --> 16:27.084
then you should go for it.
It doesn't matter what I think.

16:27.085 --> 16:29.720
And you're not just saying that
because tryouts were yesterday?

16:29.721 --> 16:31.622
Well, it's never too late.

16:31.623 --> 16:33.190
All you have to do is ask Libby.

16:33.191 --> 16:36.293
( laughing )

16:36.294 --> 16:38.062
You want me to extend

16:38.063 --> 16:39.896
the cheerleading tryouts
for her?

16:39.897 --> 16:41.098
That is too sad.

16:41.099 --> 16:44.101
Even for you.

16:44.102 --> 16:45.736
Oh, yeah. That went well.

16:48.573 --> 16:50.741
Would right now
be convenient for you?

16:52.043 --> 16:55.345
Um, sure.

16:55.346 --> 16:58.082
Uh, Sabrina,
I'm no cheerleader.

16:58.083 --> 16:59.417
I can't go through with this.

16:59.418 --> 17:01.285
Oh, what's there
to be scared of?

17:01.286 --> 17:02.819
I mean, sure,
there is the possibility

17:02.820 --> 17:05.089
of humiliation,
but this is high school.

17:05.089 --> 17:07.457
When isn't there
the possibility of humiliation?

17:07.458 --> 17:10.327
Oh, all right, all right,
I'll do it,

17:10.328 --> 17:12.296
but on one condition.

17:15.133 --> 17:17.233
Thanks for doing
this with me, Sabrina.

17:17.234 --> 17:18.868
It's giving me
the confidence I need.

17:18.869 --> 17:21.204
Well, the phrase
"you owe me one" comes to mind,

17:21.204 --> 17:23.173
yet it seems so inadequate.

17:23.174 --> 17:25.809
Here we have Sabrina Spellman

17:25.810 --> 17:27.644
and Valerie Birkhead.

about the family secret.

You mean I'm two inches shorter
for nothing?

18:25.503 --> 18:28.838

about the family secret

18:28.839 --> 18:30.941
somewhere in the house.

18:30.942 --> 18:34.444
Could you light me?
I'm late.

18:34.445 --> 18:35.912
Well,

18:35.913 --> 18:38.348
if I ever get the quarter out
of my ear, I'll send it to you.

18:38.349 --> 18:39.750
I'm gonna miss you.

18:39.751 --> 18:41.118
See you.

18:50.361 --> 18:51.561
( gasps )

18:51.562 --> 18:53.430
Oh!

18:53.431 --> 18:57.901
On second thought,
maybe I'll take the closet.

18:57.902 --> 18:59.469
HARVEY:
It's weird.

18:59.470 --> 19:02.005
I can't get the curry smell
out of my brother,

19:02.006 --> 19:04.608
and he can't sleep
without sandalwood burning.

19:04.609 --> 19:07.277
Oh,
I went through that phase.

19:07.278 --> 19:09.079
( cheering )

19:09.080 --> 19:10.580
Oh, here come the cheerleaders

19:10.581 --> 19:13.016
to announce the new squad.
I'm so nervous.

19:13.017 --> 19:14.117
Come on, Valerie.

19:14.118 --> 19:16.520
Cut the "V", dot the "I",
curl the "C--"

19:16.521 --> 19:17.888
Now you get the hang of it?

19:17.889 --> 19:19.956
LIBBY:
I have the results
of our tryouts.

19:19.957 --> 19:21.692
The new members

19:21.693 --> 19:25.095
of the second-string
cheerleading squad are:

19:25.096 --> 19:27.364
Renee Phillips,
( applause )

19:27.365 --> 19:29.332
Danita Jones,

19:29.333 --> 19:30.867
and Valerie Birkhead.

19:30.868 --> 19:32.802
( squealing )

19:32.803 --> 19:34.571
Congratulations.
Thank you.

19:34.572 --> 19:35.872
This is weird.
I still like you.

19:38.342 --> 19:39.676
Use them with honor.

19:41.279 --> 19:42.947
A second-string cheerleader.

19:42.948 --> 19:44.715
That means if a varsity
cheerleader dies

19:44.716 --> 19:46.016
or gains weight, I'm in.

19:46.017 --> 19:48.652
Do you think some day
I'll look back on this moment

19:48.653 --> 19:50.687
and say it was
the happiest of my life?

19:50.688 --> 19:52.589
If the rest
of your life stinks, yes.

19:52.590 --> 19:55.192
Let's just hope this
is the start of something big.

19:55.193 --> 19:59.463
And as for Sabrina Spellman,
who also tried out,

19:59.464 --> 20:01.331
we'll be showing
a videotape of her audition

20:01.332 --> 20:03.100
in the gymnasium after--

20:03.101 --> 20:05.034
( all cheering )

20:05.035 --> 20:08.305
Am I to understand
I wasn't good?

20:08.306 --> 20:11.875
( <i>upbeat rock theme playing</i> )

20:11.876 --> 20:14.478
If you happen to find
any shrimp toast in the couch,

20:14.479 --> 20:16.313
I wouldn't say no.

20:16.314 --> 20:19.616
Hey, I think I found
Mortimer's clue.

20:19.617 --> 20:21.585
Okay. Now I'm starting
to think he's weird.

20:21.586 --> 20:23.320
Sabrina,
you're gonna be getting

20:23.321 --> 20:24.488
a lot of clues like this.

20:24.489 --> 20:25.755
Once you've gathered them all

20:25.756 --> 20:27.357
they'll spell out
the family secret,

20:27.358 --> 20:29.493
but it's up to you
to figure it out.

20:29.494 --> 20:31.094
Okay. Well,
it looks like a superhero

20:31.095 --> 20:33.196
with "ABC" written on him.

20:33.197 --> 20:35.132
Is he Alphabet Man?

20:35.133 --> 20:36.166
No, no, no, no.

20:36.167 --> 20:37.400
He's "Spell Man."

20:37.401 --> 20:40.537
That means the family
secret's about us?

20:40.538 --> 20:42.572
Jeez, I hope all the other
clues are this juicy.

20:42.573 --> 20:45.075
I can't find Mortimer's
clue anywhere.

20:45.076 --> 20:47.210
You know, maybe it would help
if we think like him.

20:47.211 --> 20:48.512
Aunt Hilda, I--

20:48.513 --> 20:49.546
<i>Abracadoobie, abracadoo</i>

20:49.547 --> 20:51.648
<i>Help us uncover Sabrina's clue</i>

20:56.821 --> 20:58.522
Anybody hungry?

20:58.523 --> 21:00.724
I know a decent restaurant
around the corner:

21:00.725 --> 21:02.893
the Deli Lama.

21:08.399 --> 21:10.800
Wow,
this place is tidier

21:10.801 --> 21:13.003
than the appliance section
of a department store.

21:13.004 --> 21:14.170
You're not gonna
make me buy

21:14.171 --> 21:15.672
the extended warranty,
are you?

21:15.673 --> 21:17.775
SALEM:
I had a spiritual
awakening in Calcutta,

21:17.776 --> 21:21.211
not to be a holy man,
but to be a handyman.

21:21.212 --> 21:23.847
So you finally have something
to do while you're awake.

21:23.848 --> 21:24.881
HILDA:
What's this?

21:24.882 --> 21:26.783
My mantra.
You can't see it.

21:28.252 --> 21:32.289
A receipt for $3,000 worth
of appliance repair?

21:32.290 --> 21:34.158
I'm the man of the house.

21:34.159 --> 21:36.759
This is how men fix things.

21:36.760 --> 21:38.528
( sobbing )

21:39.305 --> 21:45.303
