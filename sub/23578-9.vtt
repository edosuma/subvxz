00:40.956 --> 00:41.906
What?

00:41.908 --> 00:44.013
Hello. I'm here to see Rosemary.

00:44.377 --> 00:46.043
Yeah. She's dead.

00:54.876 --> 00:57.171
Wait a second. Who the hell are you?

00:57.197 --> 00:58.697
And what's with the box of rubbers?

00:58.699 --> 01:00.599
I'm so sorry I didn't know.

01:00.601 --> 01:01.600
I'm an old friend of Rosemary's.

01:01.602 --> 01:02.901
I thought I'd surprise her,

01:02.926 --> 01:04.063
'cause, you know, it's her birthday.

01:04.089 --> 01:05.316
Yeah, I know it's her birthday.

01:05.352 --> 01:06.552
She's my dead mom. What I don't know still

01:06.577 --> 01:07.931
is what's with the rubbers?

01:08.400 --> 01:09.755
Were you banging my mom?

01:09.757 --> 01:10.884
Well, yes,

01:11.125 --> 01:13.359
but she was a lot more than a fanny-call.

01:13.361 --> 01:14.488
You mean "booty"?

01:15.509 --> 01:17.376
I suppose I do. I suppose I mean "booty."

01:17.378 --> 01:18.777
I didn't know she'd passed.

01:18.779 --> 01:21.013
We met years ago at
the Little Drywood Rodeo

01:21.015 --> 01:22.781
and sort of took up with each other.

01:23.005 --> 01:24.501
Whenever I come to town on business,

01:24.501 --> 01:27.333
I'd look Rosemary up and
we'd... We'd comfort each other.

01:28.667 --> 01:30.123
Repeatedly, all over the house.

01:30.123 --> 01:31.147
Oh, God.

01:31.871 --> 01:33.494
Jack? Jack!

01:33.959 --> 01:37.418
Please! We both loved her.

01:38.317 --> 01:40.183
Wrongo, Father time. I loved her.

01:40.185 --> 01:41.952
I've never even heard of you.
And how do you know my name?

01:41.954 --> 01:43.553
Rosemary talked a lot about you.

01:44.231 --> 01:47.557
May I ask, what have you
planned to celebrate her today?

01:47.729 --> 01:49.693
Yeah, I, uh, I don't celebrate

01:49.695 --> 01:50.661
dead people's birthdays.

01:50.663 --> 01:51.801
Here's a fun secret:

01:52.131 --> 01:53.263
They don't mind.

01:53.265 --> 01:54.398
We could visit her grave,

01:54.400 --> 01:56.196
maybe have a good cry together.

01:56.669 --> 01:58.603
It's important to let these things out.

01:58.820 --> 01:59.786
Uh-huh.

02:03.987 --> 02:05.865
In case you change your mind.

02:10.098 --> 02:11.911
- Brandon?
- _

02:12.066 --> 02:13.800
<i>One, two, three, four!</i>

02:27.638 --> 02:30.724
All right, everyone shut up
and finish shutting up fast.

02:31.486 --> 02:33.452
I've had a very icky morning.

02:33.454 --> 02:35.726
Top ten ickiest of all time.

02:35.924 --> 02:37.990
So I'm sitting there, enjoying my shower,

02:38.330 --> 02:40.459
this old guy shows up
at my door, unannounced,

02:40.461 --> 02:42.480
looking to bang my dead mom.

02:42.480 --> 02:43.996
And as if that wasn't gross enough,

02:43.998 --> 02:45.631
the guy's name was Brandon.

02:45.685 --> 02:47.274
Yeah, Brandon. I mean, we're talking about

02:47.299 --> 02:49.403
an old Brandon. Now, this dude was old.

02:49.723 --> 02:51.404
Must be the first in the New World.

02:51.406 --> 02:52.939
Anyway, this creep shows up at my door,

02:52.941 --> 02:55.041
inviting me to some sort of crying ritual

02:55.043 --> 02:56.309
for my dead mom's birthday.

02:56.311 --> 02:57.643
What are you talking about, man?

02:57.645 --> 02:59.512
Old Brandon, I do not need to cry.

03:06.521 --> 03:07.854
Tempting to plow right past this,

03:07.856 --> 03:08.955
but, fine, I'll bite.

03:08.957 --> 03:10.489
What's with the stupid dolls?

03:10.491 --> 03:12.525
These are infant
simulators from health class.

03:12.527 --> 03:15.127
They have to be fed, burped,
cuddled, changed regularly,

03:15.129 --> 03:16.529
or otherwise they cry.

03:16.531 --> 03:18.664
They're perfect replicas in every way,

03:18.666 --> 03:20.132
except we can't bathe them.

03:20.134 --> 03:21.701
This project was totally forced upon us.

03:21.703 --> 03:23.002
I'm so busy with everything I already do;

03:23.004 --> 03:24.503
I can't add a baby to it.

03:24.505 --> 03:26.105
You're, uh, gripping
that little baby's skull

03:26.107 --> 03:27.888
pretty tightly there, Sarika.

03:27.913 --> 03:29.709
I have tried all of
the cuddle configurations

03:29.711 --> 03:30.913
in the manual and none of them work.

03:30.913 --> 03:33.725
No, no. I will not be sidetracked by this.

03:33.757 --> 03:36.749
Today's mission is to
retaliate against Old Brandon.

03:36.751 --> 03:39.485
This old bitch dropped
a bombshell on my life,

03:39.487 --> 03:41.422
and I vow to pay him back in kind.

03:41.522 --> 03:43.785
At the risk of incurring your wrath...

03:44.737 --> 03:46.303
Don't you think you should consider

03:46.305 --> 03:47.755
genuinely commiserating with this man?

03:47.755 --> 03:49.488
I mean, you obviously
have some unresolved issues

03:49.490 --> 03:50.543
about your mom.

03:50.568 --> 03:52.273
What? Where you getting that from?

03:52.361 --> 03:54.174
You seem very glib about how she's...

03:54.174 --> 03:55.190
Dead?

03:57.350 --> 03:58.482
Yeah, well, that is the adjective

03:58.484 --> 03:59.713
that best describes her.

03:59.713 --> 04:01.017
I'd say you guys should be more concerned

04:01.017 --> 04:02.955
if I start describing her as "alive"

04:03.004 --> 04:05.566
or "mommy who resides in the attic."

04:06.074 --> 04:07.212
Besides...

04:07.212 --> 04:09.042
even if I did have feelings about this,

04:09.044 --> 04:11.477
I wouldn't need some sort
of hokey grieving ceremony

04:11.479 --> 04:12.530
to get over them.

04:12.530 --> 04:14.520
My therapist said you
need to find a healthy outlet

04:14.545 --> 04:16.845
for your feelings,
otherwise you'll act out.

04:17.053 --> 04:19.452
For me, it was annihilating mailboxes.

04:19.454 --> 04:21.589
I don't need help with
my dead mom's birthday.

04:21.880 --> 04:24.812
I need personal bombshells that
will rock Old Brandon's world.

04:27.923 --> 04:28.986
Ugh.

04:29.326 --> 04:31.897
This is... this is untenable. No, come on.

04:32.483 --> 04:34.116
Grab your babies, and
I want you to throw them

04:34.118 --> 04:36.231
in the closet right now,
guys... Or you get an F.

04:36.231 --> 04:37.964
Mr. Griffin, these
simulators measure how well

04:37.966 --> 04:39.198
we take care of them.

04:39.200 --> 04:40.433
If we abandon them in a closet,

04:40.435 --> 04:41.531
we'll get an F in Health.

04:41.531 --> 04:43.164
What? Threatening "F" s is my thing.

04:43.165 --> 04:44.815
I... Screw this.

04:45.349 --> 04:46.515
Gonna go talk to Durbin.

04:57.161 --> 04:58.195
Hi, Dale.

04:58.195 --> 04:59.769
You didn't have to do that.

05:00.298 --> 05:02.717
Oh, well, you shouldn't
have to pick up trash

05:02.717 --> 05:04.210
someone throws on the floor.

05:04.210 --> 05:07.911
No one has ever said that to me before.

05:07.913 --> 05:09.101
Here it goes.

05:09.102 --> 05:11.264
Uh, Miss Stef, fair warning:

05:11.917 --> 05:13.236
I'm coming at ya.

05:13.485 --> 05:15.085
- Oh.
- I, uh...

05:15.087 --> 05:18.152
Would very much like to
buy you a drink sometime.

05:18.340 --> 05:19.817
Maybe go bowling or something.

05:19.842 --> 05:21.649
- Like, as friends?
- No, ma'am.

05:21.886 --> 05:25.221
This would be a full-on romantic date.

05:25.557 --> 05:27.457
Perfect version of it ends in some kissing.

05:27.459 --> 05:29.525
Um, you know what,
actually, I just got this

05:29.527 --> 05:31.593
really expensive manicure,

05:31.627 --> 05:33.863
so I really should not be bowling.

05:33.865 --> 05:36.299
Well, then, simply do me
the courtesy of watching me

05:36.301 --> 05:38.647
throw a few frames and
then we could adjourn

05:38.647 --> 05:40.937
into the game room for some Big Buck Hunter

05:40.939 --> 05:42.372
and an appetizer sampler.

05:42.374 --> 05:44.874
And honestly, if bowling is the issue,

05:44.876 --> 05:46.242
I have other ideas.

05:46.244 --> 05:49.263
We could go to the movies or go to the zoo.

05:49.981 --> 05:51.714
- I could show you the roof.
- Listen, Dale,

05:51.716 --> 05:53.179
I gotta be honest.

05:53.831 --> 05:56.941
I would... I would never
go on a date with you.

05:58.156 --> 06:01.603
Because, um, my best friend, Mary,

06:01.605 --> 06:04.139
she has a huge crush on you.

06:04.141 --> 06:05.859
- Art room Mary?
- Yep.

06:05.859 --> 06:07.476
- Korean American?
- Yep.

06:07.478 --> 06:08.966
- This tall?
- Yep.

06:08.966 --> 06:10.565
- Eats lunch with you?
- Mm-hmm.

06:10.567 --> 06:12.000
Always goes, "Huh?"

06:12.002 --> 06:13.468
That Mary, yes.

06:13.984 --> 06:16.021
I think I know who you're talking about.

06:17.242 --> 06:18.539
Didn't know she had a crush on me.

06:18.539 --> 06:20.413
So it would violate Girl Code

06:20.811 --> 06:22.374
for me to date her crush.

06:22.375 --> 06:24.542
So, uh, it just can't happen.

06:24.814 --> 06:27.494
But thank you for your service.

06:27.842 --> 06:29.474
It smells good in here.

06:30.267 --> 06:31.600
Thank you very much.

06:34.487 --> 06:36.054
This is my class.

06:36.056 --> 06:38.115
Why can't I talk about safe sex?

06:38.358 --> 06:40.545
Look, Michelle, this is
coming from above, really, okay?

06:40.570 --> 06:42.404
And I think it's good that students feel

06:42.429 --> 06:44.099
how hard it is to have a baby.

06:44.197 --> 06:45.461
You know, I don't have any babies,

06:45.461 --> 06:46.927
but I've been in a restaurant
where one is screaming,

06:46.929 --> 06:48.262
and it's like, no.

06:48.506 --> 06:50.606
Ralph, you know these robot babies?

06:50.608 --> 06:52.375
- They suck!
- Ding, ding, ding.

06:52.377 --> 06:53.709
- Exactly.
- Yeah, you gotta

06:53.711 --> 06:55.993
shut this down, man. I
need my kids focused on...

06:57.749 --> 06:58.914
Uh...

06:58.916 --> 07:00.082
Pass the A.P. test?

07:00.084 --> 07:02.318
Yeah. Yes. Yeah, perfect. The A.P. te...

07:02.320 --> 07:03.886
The babies are messing up test prep.

07:03.888 --> 07:05.654
You know what, guys,
there's nothing I can do here.

07:05.656 --> 07:08.824
I mean, Ohio is back to
abstinence-only education.

07:08.826 --> 07:10.026
- Our...
- Come on.

07:10.028 --> 07:11.804
I need to give these kids condoms.

07:11.829 --> 07:13.516
Ralph, they work.

07:13.784 --> 07:15.482
Otherwise Keith and I would have...

07:16.154 --> 07:17.653
100 or so kids.

07:18.201 --> 07:19.464
Maybe two-hundy.

07:19.464 --> 07:22.298
Okay, Michelle, thank
you for being so open,

07:22.480 --> 07:24.714
but the only thing that we're
allowed to say about condoms

07:24.716 --> 07:26.683
is that they are 2% ineffective

07:26.685 --> 07:28.818
and everyone is watching
you while you buy them.

07:28.820 --> 07:32.342
So our only option is to scare
these kids off of sex entirely.

07:32.342 --> 07:33.402
Ralph. Ralph, Ralph.

07:33.402 --> 07:35.533
My kids are in no danger
of getting laid, okay?

07:35.560 --> 07:37.326
They do not need a sex deterrent, trust me.

07:37.351 --> 07:39.084
If anybody needs a sex deterrent,

07:39.086 --> 07:40.853
it's wrinkly old gigolos
who travel from town to town,

07:40.855 --> 07:44.290
seducing innocent old moms who
just want to enjoy a nice day

07:44.292 --> 07:46.189
at the rodeo. That's all they want.

07:46.240 --> 07:47.672
Eh...

07:48.863 --> 07:50.254
Has that been happening?

07:50.254 --> 07:52.082
I don't recognize this country anymore.

07:52.356 --> 07:54.456
If we're gonna settle
the score with Old Brandon,

07:54.458 --> 07:56.764
we're gonna have to divide and conquer.

07:56.764 --> 07:58.897
All right, B-squad's got
the babies under control.

07:58.899 --> 08:01.567
A-squad, let's hear what you've
got on devastating Old Brandon.

08:01.569 --> 08:02.835
Just tell him that your mom

08:02.837 --> 08:04.370
slept with everyone on the block.

08:04.372 --> 08:05.938
Come on, Anthony, I can't use that.

08:05.940 --> 08:07.473
All right, keep in
mind, this is a bombshell

08:07.475 --> 08:08.807
that's gonna be dropped at her grave.

08:08.809 --> 08:10.342
And today's her birthday?

08:10.661 --> 08:12.581
And it's her birthday, Anthony.
Show some respect.

08:12.581 --> 08:15.315
You know, sometimes I get mad
because I don't want to be sad.

08:15.317 --> 08:16.872
Cool, Dan. So what?

08:16.873 --> 08:18.619
I'm just saying maybe you're really sad.

08:19.121 --> 08:20.888
About your mom's birthday.

08:20.890 --> 08:22.590
You know what's really
sad is watching you guys

08:22.592 --> 08:24.741
trying to analyze me with
your unfinished brains.

08:24.741 --> 08:26.619
Somebody give me something
I can use, please.

08:26.644 --> 08:27.676
Heather, go.

08:27.678 --> 08:29.478
sucker punch.

08:29.480 --> 08:30.646
All right, that's in the right area.

08:30.648 --> 08:31.751
Can't do that, though.

08:31.752 --> 08:33.452
Fighting an old man's kind
of what got me banished

08:33.453 --> 08:34.953
at Toledo in the first
place. Come on, guys!

08:34.956 --> 08:36.057
Come on!

08:36.390 --> 08:38.163
Don't you care that this man banged my mom?

08:38.188 --> 08:39.984
- Son of a bitch!
- Seems like you're being

08:40.009 --> 08:41.147
a bit of a prude.

08:41.172 --> 08:43.642
A prude? Well, that's not possible.

08:43.735 --> 08:46.465
How could I be a prude
when I have had sex with...

08:46.671 --> 08:49.172
Twenty-four women.

08:49.174 --> 08:51.031
- We get it.
- Do you?

08:51.229 --> 08:53.196
Mr. Griffin, I think I have something.

08:53.198 --> 08:54.564
Despite being in B-squad,

08:54.566 --> 08:56.212
I have discovered that Old Brandon

08:56.237 --> 08:57.927
has a daughter here in Toledo.

08:59.170 --> 09:02.389
Sadie Rodonski. A personal injury lawyer.

09:03.127 --> 09:05.466
You know what, this
could actually be perfect.

09:05.628 --> 09:07.411
I could tell his daughter
about his disgusting affair

09:07.412 --> 09:09.545
with my dead mom. She'd
be completely yucked out

09:09.547 --> 09:11.180
just like I was. It'll ruin all their

09:11.182 --> 09:13.015
family dinners for the rest of their lives.

09:13.017 --> 09:14.016
Even Steven.

09:14.018 --> 09:15.351
That doesn't sound even.

09:15.353 --> 09:17.664
That just sounds like harassing a stranger.

09:17.996 --> 09:20.686
Uh, yes, hi. I have been severely

09:20.686 --> 09:21.929
personally injured.

09:21.929 --> 09:23.809
I'd like to speak to
your top attorney, please.

09:24.805 --> 09:25.863
No, no, no. Not her.

09:25.865 --> 09:28.047
Get me Sadie Rodonski.

09:32.330 --> 09:33.964
All right, Mr. Griffin.

09:35.146 --> 09:36.717
Thanks for waiting.

09:37.282 --> 09:38.746
Let's see if we can get you paid.

09:39.417 --> 09:43.386
So what is the nature of your injury?

09:43.388 --> 09:45.888
Well, I have been severely grossed out.

09:45.890 --> 09:47.295
Severely grossed out?

09:47.296 --> 09:49.580
Unfortunately, yeah, to the max.

09:50.019 --> 09:51.918
Sadie, I hate to spring this on you,

09:51.920 --> 09:53.756
but our old parents...

09:54.678 --> 09:57.319
well, they, uh, they...

09:58.293 --> 10:00.592
they put their stuff all over each other.

10:00.592 --> 10:02.926
Oh, my God. Are you Rosemary's kid?

10:03.132 --> 10:04.573
Wait a minute, you already know about this?

10:04.573 --> 10:05.672
Yes.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.158
Damn it.

10:07.442 --> 10:10.209
I... I was hoping to devastate
you to get back at your dad.

10:10.645 --> 10:12.299
Oh, my God. I totally get that.

10:12.299 --> 10:14.580
I mean, I hated your mom when I found out.

10:14.689 --> 10:16.851
They got together, like, eight
weeks after my mom's funeral.

10:16.852 --> 10:19.619
Oh, ouch. So your mom's dead too, huh?

10:19.621 --> 10:20.553
She's dead.

10:20.555 --> 10:22.021
Yeah, sounds like your dad's got a type.

10:22.023 --> 10:23.223
Oh.

10:23.225 --> 10:24.927
Almost-dead people.

10:27.562 --> 10:29.462
So what was this plan?

10:29.464 --> 10:30.930
I mean, did you just want
me to get me to picture

10:30.932 --> 10:34.300
these two white raisins stuck together

10:34.302 --> 10:35.869
so I'd pick a fight with my dad?

10:35.871 --> 10:36.970
Yeah, that was pretty much it.

10:36.972 --> 10:38.588
Yeah, that's pretty conniving.

10:39.274 --> 10:40.573
So I guess you're not just a face.

10:40.575 --> 10:42.458
You've got a brain too.

10:42.458 --> 10:43.691
Oh, yeah, I got a big old brain.

10:43.693 --> 10:45.178
Yeah, PhD from Harvard.

10:47.830 --> 10:50.064
You know, I just
thought of a really fun way

10:50.066 --> 10:52.650
that we could get back at our folks.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.024
Lock the door.

11:00.049 --> 11:01.635
For real? You sure?

11:03.379 --> 11:04.579
Devastate me.

11:14.347 --> 11:15.925
I'll get the art room today.

11:16.259 --> 11:18.025
Oh, okay, just 'cause
they gave you the keys,

11:18.027 --> 11:19.420
you my boss now?

11:19.420 --> 11:20.570
Hans?

11:23.284 --> 11:24.588
Oh, hey, Dale. What's up?

11:24.752 --> 11:28.392
Oh, boy. Uh, let me stop you right there.

11:28.686 --> 11:31.687
You are clearly a good and kind person

11:31.689 --> 11:33.720
who deserves happiness with someone.

11:34.818 --> 11:36.517
But I am not that someone.

11:36.517 --> 11:38.688
And you have to get that through your head.

11:39.404 --> 11:41.632
- Huh?
- The best thing for you to do

11:41.657 --> 11:44.039
is just forget about me.

11:47.704 --> 11:50.261
You can tell your parents
we're dating, if that's helpful.

11:54.937 --> 11:56.403
What the crap just happened?

12:08.887 --> 12:10.587
Twenty-five, bitches.

12:11.194 --> 12:14.070
Yeah, after a very productive
meeting with Sadie Rodonski

12:14.095 --> 12:17.630
this morning, I have now
had sex with 25 women.

12:18.010 --> 12:21.767
And I am armed with a bombshell
that is going to destroy

12:21.769 --> 12:22.973
Old Brandon's life.

12:23.137 --> 12:25.152
So you just had sex before work?

12:25.152 --> 12:26.084
Yeah, man.

12:26.086 --> 12:28.253
Are you prepared for the consequences?

12:28.255 --> 12:29.621
She could get pregnant.

12:29.623 --> 12:30.722
- No, we were safe.
- We were safe.

12:30.724 --> 12:31.938
It's fine. It's fine.

12:32.292 --> 12:33.273
I think...

12:33.800 --> 12:35.133
I think we'll be... fine.

12:35.135 --> 12:36.302
Are you guys in love?

12:36.302 --> 12:37.769
The sperm can't crack the lady's eggshell

12:37.770 --> 12:39.068
unless they're in love.

12:39.099 --> 12:41.114
Wow, you guys really do need Sex Ed.

12:41.139 --> 12:42.772
Plus, you're focused
on the wrong part, man.

12:42.774 --> 12:44.378
I have my bombshell. This is great.

12:44.710 --> 12:46.543
All I have to do now is call Old Brandon,

12:46.545 --> 12:48.044
arrange to meet him at my mom's grave,

12:48.046 --> 12:49.446
and then...

12:51.700 --> 12:53.080
Is this healthy?

12:53.080 --> 12:55.640
Using sex as a weapon
seems extreme, even for you.

12:55.665 --> 12:57.465
Marcus, I'm not using sex as a weapon.

12:57.466 --> 12:59.833
I'm using the fact that I happened into

13:00.015 --> 13:02.749
organic, consensual, wonderful love-making

13:02.751 --> 13:05.699
as a tool to destroy my enemy.

13:05.888 --> 13:07.487
Plus, Saddie and I are cool, man.

13:07.489 --> 13:08.496
You know, we're having drinks on Friday,

13:08.496 --> 13:09.628
so, yeah.

13:09.630 --> 13:10.838
Now, if guys will excuse me,

13:10.863 --> 13:12.732
I'm gonna call the old letch.

13:14.470 --> 13:16.137
Guys, just let him go.

13:16.139 --> 13:17.505
He's being self-destructive.

13:17.507 --> 13:19.666
So what? I already deal with this brat.

13:19.666 --> 13:20.965
I can't care of another one.

13:20.966 --> 13:22.432
At what age do you think we'll start

13:22.434 --> 13:25.322
"happening into organic,
wonderful love-making"?

13:26.058 --> 13:28.385
I don't think we're those kind of guys.

13:29.207 --> 13:31.708
Oh, yeah, man. I'm so down to grieve.

13:31.710 --> 13:33.676
Yeah, you know, I need this for my heart.

13:34.328 --> 13:35.718
Yeah, no, I'll meet you right there.

13:35.743 --> 13:37.276
I'll meet you right at the gravestone.

13:37.279 --> 13:39.346
We'll turn on the waterworks.
It's gonna be great.

13:42.779 --> 13:43.786
Hey, Mary.

13:43.786 --> 13:45.752
You know, let's eat lunch in my car today.

13:45.893 --> 13:48.935
All these crying babies
got my womb twitching.

13:49.029 --> 13:50.929
Mm-hmm. Just give a minute.

13:50.931 --> 13:54.532
And by the way, so I might have told

13:54.534 --> 13:57.912
Dale the janitor that you
might have a crush on him.

13:57.912 --> 13:59.604
He asked me out, and I kind of panicked.

13:59.606 --> 14:01.272
Oh, well, this explains a lot.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.374
He just came in here
and shot me down, hard.

14:03.376 --> 14:04.375
Like, out of nowhere.

14:04.377 --> 14:06.110
Mary, I am so sorry.

14:06.112 --> 14:07.796
See, this is my fault. I'm gonna go.

14:07.821 --> 14:09.287
I don't have time to be mad at you.

14:09.312 --> 14:11.082
He took it way too far.

14:11.084 --> 14:13.685
I'm gonna hook him and
then dump him on his ass.

14:14.167 --> 14:16.367
This here is a janitor trap.

14:16.367 --> 14:19.422
See, tonight, Dale's gonna
come in and spot this $5 bill

14:19.422 --> 14:21.837
sitting conspicuously on my trashcan.

14:21.839 --> 14:23.505
- That's the bait.
- Okay.

14:23.507 --> 14:24.773
And now you know he's gonna dive right now,

14:24.775 --> 14:26.175
rooting around for more.

14:26.177 --> 14:27.376
Greedy little pig.

14:27.378 --> 14:28.711
But what we'll find instead

14:28.713 --> 14:30.985
is a selection of carefully curated items,

14:31.010 --> 14:33.515
which you might call sexy trash.

14:33.673 --> 14:36.352
Such as a flattering photo of <i> moi.</i>

14:36.354 --> 14:37.496
Yeah.

14:38.233 --> 14:39.455
The novel "Dune."

14:39.887 --> 14:41.019
All guys like that.

14:41.509 --> 14:43.976
A yoga award for most flexible.

14:43.978 --> 14:45.378
- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm.

14:45.380 --> 14:47.046
And then just some old regular trash

14:47.048 --> 14:48.681
so he feels good about doing his job.

14:49.073 --> 14:51.951
Once he gets all thirsty,
that dirty like dastard's

14:51.953 --> 14:53.419
gonna come running back to mama,

14:53.421 --> 14:54.854
begging for a drink,

14:54.856 --> 14:56.751
which I'll be delighted to deny him.

14:56.751 --> 14:58.217
This is a lot, Mary. Okay?

14:58.220 --> 15:00.611
I mean, I would have just keyed his car.

15:00.636 --> 15:02.983
Well, I teach Art, Stef. I like crafts.

15:09.261 --> 15:10.347
Hey.

15:10.441 --> 15:12.863
I know we started off on a bad foot.

15:12.887 --> 15:14.637
And I'm glad you decided to come.

15:14.637 --> 15:17.225
Yeah. Well, you really threw me
for a loop there, you know.

15:17.331 --> 15:18.543
But it's okay, it's fine.

15:18.568 --> 15:20.103
So, no big.

15:20.670 --> 15:22.425
Uh, you wanna get this thing going or what?

15:22.583 --> 15:24.749
Oh, would you like to
start by saying a few words

15:24.774 --> 15:25.907
about your mom?

15:25.909 --> 15:27.058
Uh, no, you know what,

15:27.083 --> 15:28.168
I think it's better if you go first.

15:28.193 --> 15:29.611
I want to go last. You
go first. Go, go, go.

15:30.091 --> 15:33.334
Oh, well, after my wife...

15:33.957 --> 15:36.385
died, I didn't think
I'd ever feel passion...

15:36.387 --> 15:37.887
- Right.
- Again.

15:37.889 --> 15:41.697
But my heart found its feet
once more with Rosemary.

15:41.722 --> 15:42.882
I banged your daughter.

15:46.830 --> 15:49.025
Why aren't you reacting?
Did I break your old brain?

15:50.968 --> 15:52.701
Well, color me not surprised.

15:52.703 --> 15:54.739
You two are a couple of hot tamales.

15:54.739 --> 15:57.127
I'm glad the two of you found
comfort in each other's arms.

15:57.127 --> 15:59.167
You know, that's your daughter, you sleaze.

15:59.344 --> 16:01.797
I'm what you call "sex positive."

16:01.798 --> 16:04.614
Daughters have sex, Jack. So do mothers.

16:04.614 --> 16:07.398
And it seems our families
generate some pretty potent

16:07.423 --> 16:08.709
sexual chemistry.

16:08.734 --> 16:09.899
God, will you shut up?

16:09.969 --> 16:11.602
Look, you're bound to feel big feelings

16:11.604 --> 16:13.032
here at this place.

16:13.213 --> 16:16.557
It's okay to let it out, Jack. Huh?

16:16.557 --> 16:18.542
Come on, son. It's okay to cry.

16:20.411 --> 16:21.499
Ooh!

16:22.263 --> 16:23.496
Oh!

16:23.498 --> 16:25.402
- Ah!
- What are you doing, Jack?

16:26.234 --> 16:28.181
Stop!

16:34.709 --> 16:37.176
These babies are
getting out of hand, Ralph.

16:37.178 --> 16:38.844
The students aren't sleeping,

16:38.846 --> 16:40.179
the parents are complaining.

16:40.181 --> 16:41.716
And all the other teachers hate me!

16:41.716 --> 16:43.516
Okay, Alyssa, Alyssa. I'm
sure they don't hate you.

16:43.518 --> 16:46.285
Coach Novak threw a
dirty diaper at my head.

16:46.634 --> 16:49.435
Which I'm now realizing must
have been from his nephew

16:49.437 --> 16:52.679
or something, which means
he drove to school with it.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.312
I'll talk to Dick, all right?

16:54.314 --> 16:56.600
But for now, we got to tough
it out with these babies,

16:56.625 --> 16:57.983
for the next couple of days.

16:58.102 --> 17:00.477
They're not responding to
the soothing techniques anymore.

17:00.502 --> 17:02.668
I think there's something
really wrong with them, Ralph.

17:02.931 --> 17:06.211
Okay, I may have gone
outside official supply lines

17:06.236 --> 17:08.779
to get a discount, but when
the guy sold them to me,

17:08.779 --> 17:10.311
he said they were slightly irregular.

17:10.314 --> 17:12.748
I assumed that meant
it was how their fingers

17:12.750 --> 17:14.183
looked like tiny penises.

17:14.183 --> 17:15.648
I didn't know they were gonna malfunction.

17:15.651 --> 17:18.786
Well, they are, Ralph.
What are we gonna do?

17:19.117 --> 17:20.117
Oh, God.

17:20.196 --> 17:21.252
Sorry.

17:21.252 --> 17:22.618
It looks like Willem Dafoe.

17:24.821 --> 17:27.233
Oh. It's a compliment.

17:27.864 --> 17:29.597
It says this should work.

17:29.622 --> 17:30.884
Why isn't it working?

17:30.884 --> 17:33.018
I can't swaddle any tighter.

17:34.472 --> 17:36.672
Can't find my sucky...

17:37.157 --> 17:38.653
food juice can.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.458
Stupid mom brain.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.327
Hey, hold on to my grade for a second

17:42.329 --> 17:43.883
while I stop by my locker.

17:45.095 --> 17:47.289
Latch on, damn it. Latch on.

17:47.430 --> 17:48.613
Shut up!

17:48.765 --> 17:51.491
Shut up your silly cybernetic offspring.

17:51.834 --> 17:53.401
Whoa, did you get in a fight?

17:53.403 --> 17:54.769
At your mom's grave?

17:54.943 --> 17:56.576
Yeah, Old Brandon frickin' decked me.

17:56.578 --> 17:58.696
But get this, guys: I told
him I boinked his daughter;

17:58.721 --> 17:59.812
he didn't give a hoot.

17:59.814 --> 18:01.514
Stupid hippie thought it was neat.

18:01.516 --> 18:03.116
So why did he knock you around then?

18:03.118 --> 18:05.384
Well, because I tried to
sucker punch him, Heather.

18:05.763 --> 18:07.453
And how are old men so strong?

18:07.453 --> 18:10.221
I mean, this guy had the
grip strength of an orangutan.

18:10.223 --> 18:11.930
- It was insane.
- Shh!

18:16.796 --> 18:19.230
Seriously, shut those babies up.

18:19.232 --> 18:21.185
We can't! They won't stop.

18:21.367 --> 18:22.966
This is how the world is now.

18:23.169 --> 18:24.231
Mother of God.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.437
The sound is burrowing into my brain.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.739
- It's worse than Marcus.
- Hey, that's unfair.

18:28.741 --> 18:30.975
Unfair? I am the bereaved party here.

18:30.977 --> 18:33.842
Some traveling pervert steals
my mom's birthday from me

18:33.842 --> 18:36.178
and then has the grey-haired balls

18:36.210 --> 18:38.014
to tell me how to deal with her death?

18:41.305 --> 18:42.576
Give me the babies.

18:43.022 --> 18:44.922
Just give me all the babies.

18:44.924 --> 18:46.799
Stupid thing. Come on, give it to me.

18:47.060 --> 18:48.937
Give this to me. Gimme, gimme, gimme.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.162
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it, guys.

18:51.478 --> 18:53.798
Yeah, yep, all the babies.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.867
I'm gonna deal with this
baby problem right now.

19:00.190 --> 19:01.181
Give me that.

19:01.858 --> 19:03.491
Gimme, gimme. Gimme babies.

19:03.493 --> 19:04.482
Throw it in.

19:04.627 --> 19:05.809
Baby.

19:07.267 --> 19:08.354
Here we go.

19:09.932 --> 19:11.799
Anthony, what the hell? Where's my baby?

19:11.801 --> 19:13.574
Mr. Griffin sort of took it.

19:13.574 --> 19:14.645
Took it where?

19:14.646 --> 19:17.214
He took them all. We're free.

19:17.415 --> 19:18.714
But I'll get an F in Health.

19:18.972 --> 19:20.648
My baby! My baby!

19:32.029 --> 19:34.152
- No!
- It's okay, Sarika.

19:34.398 --> 19:35.664
There's no more assignment.

19:35.666 --> 19:37.361
We can't be graded on any of this now.

19:39.170 --> 19:40.323
All quiet.

19:45.707 --> 19:46.997
No more grades?

19:47.831 --> 19:48.933
It's over.

19:53.037 --> 19:54.223
There we go.

20:02.222 --> 20:03.276
Whoo!

20:05.158 --> 20:06.827
That was the ticket right there.

20:07.393 --> 20:09.026
I feel refreshed, you know?

20:09.028 --> 20:11.019
Nothing like a dip sometimes.

20:11.749 --> 20:13.364
So, uh, what do you guys want to do?

20:13.366 --> 20:14.673
Go back to class?

20:16.536 --> 20:17.536
Yeah.

20:19.443 --> 20:21.242
Old Brandon's probably an all right guy.

20:21.731 --> 20:22.784
Yeah.

20:28.848 --> 20:29.847
Ms. Wagner?

20:30.527 --> 20:32.176
I have got to tell you.

20:32.418 --> 20:34.268
You have the sexiest trash

20:34.293 --> 20:37.040
I have ever dumped into a larger bin.

20:37.757 --> 20:39.806
You ever been to the good gravel pit?

20:40.894 --> 20:43.060
Ooh, now, you know, I would love to,

20:43.302 --> 20:44.333
but...

20:44.396 --> 20:47.439
my friend Stef has the
biggest crush on you.

20:47.700 --> 20:48.743
Ooh.

20:52.739 --> 20:54.122
You two have fun.
