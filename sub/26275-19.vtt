WEBVTT

00:03.437 --> 00:06.174
Well, it says here
that in 20 years,

00:06.207 --> 00:09.443
all the cars on the road
will be self-driving.

00:09.477 --> 00:11.612
Wow. What happens if
the artificial intelligence

00:11.645 --> 00:13.181
starts to learn

00:13.214 --> 00:16.484
and the cars decide to drive
everyone into the ocean?

00:16.517 --> 00:18.819
"Hi. You've reached
your destination:

00:18.852 --> 00:21.489
"your death.

00:21.522 --> 00:25.025
We are now in total control.
All hail Elon."

00:26.494 --> 00:28.129
-Hi. Morning.
-VANESSA: Hey, Mandy.

00:28.162 --> 00:29.530
You want some breakfast?

00:29.563 --> 00:33.201
Uh, only if it comes with a side
of business advice.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.636
Oh, you having some trouble
with your new designs?

00:35.669 --> 00:37.671
Uh, yeah, kind of.
The last two months,

00:37.705 --> 00:39.340
I've been trying to get
meetings with buyers,

00:39.373 --> 00:42.009
but they all said no.
I just need someone to say yes.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.211
-Yes!
-No.

00:43.244 --> 00:45.313
-Yes.
-No!

00:45.346 --> 00:47.181
Okay, here's my idea.

00:47.215 --> 00:50.017
What if I paid an influencer
to wear one of my designs?

00:50.050 --> 00:51.719
Oh, what's an influencer?

00:51.752 --> 00:53.954
It's a cool way of saying
"spokesperson."

00:53.987 --> 00:57.491
No. It is a social media celeb
who makes tons of cash

00:57.525 --> 00:59.593
endorsing products
to all their followers.

00:59.627 --> 01:02.830
Sounds like a spokesperson.

01:02.863 --> 01:05.866
In Hong Kong,
everybody follows Ping Ping.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.901
When she posts a picture
of herself in a sweater,

01:07.935 --> 01:09.737
it sells out immediately.

01:09.770 --> 01:12.039
Really? You think Ping Ping
would wear something of mine?

01:12.072 --> 01:14.242
Doubtful.
She's a Pomeranian.

01:16.644 --> 01:18.379
Well, I'm off to catch
the school bus,

01:18.412 --> 01:20.080
unless it's driven by
(robotic voice): a robot.

01:20.114 --> 01:21.615
-Then I'll need a ride.
-(Mike chuckles)

01:23.884 --> 01:25.519
All hail Elon.

01:29.523 --> 01:31.091
-Bye.
-Have fun.

01:31.125 --> 01:33.026
Listen, I don't think
spending money on an influencer

01:33.060 --> 01:34.728
is a good idea
for you right now.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.597
Oh, yeah, but I'm not talking
about somebody huge

01:36.630 --> 01:38.566
like-like Hailey Baldwin.
Somebody I can afford,

01:38.599 --> 01:40.468
like one of
the Real Housewives of Denver.

01:41.802 --> 01:44.672
You know, somewhere,
your old business professor

01:44.705 --> 01:46.874
has just burst into tears.
(cries)

01:46.907 --> 01:50.110
Yeah, Dad, this is the way
of the future.

01:50.144 --> 01:52.146
It's how my generation operates.

01:52.180 --> 01:54.215
If I get the right celeb
to drop my hashtag,

01:54.248 --> 01:55.549
my sales could blow up.

01:55.583 --> 01:57.651
Ka-ka-kow! Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa!

01:57.685 --> 02:01.955
Uh, first off, that's not
what an explosion sounds like.

02:01.989 --> 02:04.258
And listen,
the world may have changed,

02:04.292 --> 02:06.927
but the principles of business
are still the same.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.997
Are they?

02:10.030 --> 02:11.732
Why don't you come
to work today?

02:11.765 --> 02:14.268
I'm having a meeting with
one of our manufacturer's reps.

02:14.302 --> 02:16.770
She always gets in the door.
I don't always buy her product.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.672
-Celia Powers.
-Mm. Oh, wow.

02:18.706 --> 02:20.741
-She sounds like a TV lawyer.
-(Mike laughs)

02:20.774 --> 02:22.443
Uh, no, I remember Celia.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.745
She's the one who always tries
to start the conga line

02:24.778 --> 02:26.113
at the Outdoor Man
Christmas parties.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.448
MIKE:
She's a bit of a character,

02:27.481 --> 02:28.982
but you might learn
something from her.

02:29.016 --> 02:31.652
I have.
I've learned that I hate conga.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.954
Well, it sounds like to me
you're trying to teach me

02:33.987 --> 02:35.623
the way things
aren't done anymore.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.491
All right, look, just go
with your father into the past.

02:37.525 --> 02:39.560
He's comfortable there.

02:39.593 --> 02:41.429
-I'll see you later.
-Yeah, bye.

02:41.462 --> 02:43.497
And remember, next time
you're making fun of the past,

02:43.531 --> 02:46.567
that's where I met you.

02:48.302 --> 02:50.304
*

02:55.142 --> 02:58.078
(humming)
Ooh, 40% off sale.

02:58.111 --> 03:01.048
Ew, 100% ugly.

03:01.081 --> 03:03.784
That's why they're 40% off.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.819
So tell me a about Celia.
What's she like?

03:05.853 --> 03:10.258
-Wow, how can I...
-Mike Baxter. 'Sup?

03:10.291 --> 03:12.526
Uh, Celia, good to see you.
Thanks for coming by,

03:12.560 --> 03:14.962
but, actually, I think
it's pronounced "Wassup."

03:14.995 --> 03:16.664
Mmm. No, no.

03:16.697 --> 03:19.032
Little update, Mike:
I was Celia.

03:19.066 --> 03:21.969
-Mm-hmm.
-Now I go by CeCe P.

03:22.002 --> 03:25.973
Like Cardi B, except she raps
and I rep. (chuckles)

03:26.006 --> 03:27.975
You feelin' me?

03:28.008 --> 03:29.677
Who's the Betty?

03:29.710 --> 03:31.645
She's actually a Mandy.
It's my daughter.

03:31.679 --> 03:33.146
She's an up-and-coming
fashion designer,

03:33.180 --> 03:34.982
just gonna sit in
on the meeting.

03:35.015 --> 03:36.850
Hmm. Tall blonde. Me likey.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.552
(chuckles)

03:38.586 --> 03:41.289
-Uh, me likey those shoes.
-Okay.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.056
Bangin', right?

03:43.090 --> 03:45.058
-Okay, down to business.
-Great.

03:45.092 --> 03:48.262
I have got a van
full of samples downstairs.

03:48.296 --> 03:51.332
Sick merchandise
to bring in new customers.

03:51.365 --> 03:53.233
Okay, great, always looking
forward. Not so sick.

03:53.267 --> 03:55.536
I don't want any of that
commie Bernie Sanders look.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.671
-More the moderate John Kasich.
-Mm.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.507
You know, it's perfect
that she's here,

03:59.540 --> 04:01.342
because I looked at your data,

04:01.375 --> 04:03.344
and one of your weakest
sales demographics

04:03.377 --> 04:05.145
is the Betty Mandy.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.382
Honey, it's true, I love my dad,

04:08.416 --> 04:10.050
but I hate this store.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.585
You don't hate the store.

04:11.619 --> 04:13.721
You're just not that into
hunting and fishing.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.623
You know, maybe I would be
if the jackets fit better.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.458
Well, it's a choice--
do you want tight-fitting,

04:17.491 --> 04:19.927
or you want someplace
to hold your dead stuff?

04:19.960 --> 04:22.796
We've opened a dialogue.
Popcorn some more.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.532
-What?
-Uh, millennial women

04:24.565 --> 04:27.901
want to go from workout to work
in the same great outfit.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.437
Yes. Athleisure.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.372
-Already crushing it.
-No. No, no, no, no, no.

04:31.405 --> 04:34.174
We don't do athleisure. There's
not a lot of deer hunters

04:34.207 --> 04:35.776
that want yoga pants, okay?

04:35.809 --> 04:37.077
Wait.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.079
Um, um-um-um, okay,
how about these?

04:39.112 --> 04:40.914
-Mountain climbing pants, right?
-Uh-huh.

04:40.948 --> 04:43.083
They're-they're strong,
they're stretchy, they're soft.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.886
What if we drop the waist,
we taper the leg?

04:45.919 --> 04:48.422
-You can wear these anywhere.
-That's interesting.

04:48.456 --> 04:50.057
Uh, kettle-corn me.

04:51.492 --> 04:53.427
You know,
it's a little safe for me,

04:53.461 --> 04:55.429
but you're just warming up,
aren't you?

04:55.463 --> 04:58.031
-'Kay. Um... (clears throat)
-Yeah? Okay.

04:58.065 --> 05:00.468
You know those, uh... those
fly-fishing waders we sell?

05:00.501 --> 05:02.403
-Mm-hmm.
-Neoprene with the boots
built in?

05:02.436 --> 05:04.772
What if those waders
were formfitting?

05:04.805 --> 05:06.440
They'd be called wet suits.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.543
I have a whole bunch
of them downstairs.

05:09.577 --> 05:11.945
Okay. Listen,
don't be discouraged.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.246
This is the dance.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.148
Okay, what would you do
with the boots?

05:15.182 --> 05:17.651
Go crazy, because if I can't
have something fun on my feet,

05:17.685 --> 05:19.653
-why am I outdoors anyway?
-(laughs)

05:19.687 --> 05:22.623
Hey, yeah. Why don't we
just close the store?

05:23.991 --> 05:26.259
How do you feel
about utility vests?

05:26.293 --> 05:29.463
Um, I'm seeing camo, ammo
and a whole lot of slay.

05:29.497 --> 05:32.165
Yass, queen!

05:32.199 --> 05:35.636
I'm having a nervous breakdown
right now.

05:35.669 --> 05:38.271
-Okay, we need
a walk-and-talk, Betty.
-Yes.

05:38.305 --> 05:40.908
Okay? Let's go down there
and light up the sales floor.

05:40.941 --> 05:43.577
-Hey, how old do you think I am?
-You're, like, a fetus.

05:43.611 --> 05:45.245
Okurrr!

05:48.281 --> 05:50.618
I smell burnt toast.

05:50.651 --> 05:52.586
*

05:54.121 --> 05:56.457
So, his brother says,
"No, no, no, no, no,

05:56.490 --> 05:58.025
"you're supposed to put
the potato

05:58.058 --> 05:59.893
in the front
of the bathing suit."

05:59.927 --> 06:02.195
(laughter)

06:02.229 --> 06:04.798
Good Lord, Ed, how many times

06:04.832 --> 06:06.834
-can you tell that joke?
-Oh, well...

06:06.867 --> 06:08.869
Oh, I could hear it
a thousand times.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.804
I mean, a potato at the beach?

06:10.838 --> 06:13.741
(laughing):
Where did it come from?

06:16.544 --> 06:17.811
Uh, let me guess, Kristin--

06:17.845 --> 06:19.547
those-those boxes belong
to Ed Alzate.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.381
Uh, yeah, they sure do,
so why were they

06:21.415 --> 06:22.850
in the storage closet
of my restaurant?

06:22.883 --> 06:24.852
Oh, will you
take it easy, Kristin.

06:24.885 --> 06:27.220
These are very important things
that I cannot throw away.

06:27.254 --> 06:28.388
Oh, you... Oh!

06:28.422 --> 06:30.691
So you cannot get rid of...

06:30.724 --> 06:31.759
these?

06:34.361 --> 06:36.063
I guess that answers itself,
doesn't it?

06:36.096 --> 06:37.330
-(Ed laughing)
-Well...

06:37.364 --> 06:39.032
I am just glad
that they are back

06:39.066 --> 06:40.601
in the hands
of their rightful owner,

06:40.634 --> 06:42.603
-along with the rest of this.
-Okay. Thank you.

06:42.636 --> 06:44.505
-Thank you. Thank you, Kristin.
-Goodbye.

06:44.538 --> 06:47.407
Ed, man, what is
all this stuff, man?

06:47.441 --> 06:49.677
-What? Huh?
-What... what...

06:49.710 --> 06:51.211
Cassette tapes.

06:51.244 --> 06:54.214
-Man, throw these away.
-Come on, what?

06:54.247 --> 06:56.049
Throw away my life?

06:56.083 --> 06:59.386
Come on. This is an audio diary
I've kept through the years.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.655
I plan to turn it into a book.

07:01.689 --> 07:02.990
Oh. What are you waiting for?

07:03.023 --> 07:04.592
It could be a book
that's so good,

07:04.625 --> 07:06.494
they turn it into a movie--
like the Bible.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.896
Ooh. Or Air Bud.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.831
Eh.

07:10.864 --> 07:12.900
-Hey, you know
who should play you?
-Huh?

07:12.933 --> 07:15.836
That-that bug-eyed kid
from Bohemian Rhapsody.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.671
Oh, yeah?
I was picturing Redford,

07:17.705 --> 07:19.640
but, you know,
have you seen him lately?

07:19.673 --> 07:21.108
He's getting a little old.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.410
Hey, listen, uh,

07:23.443 --> 07:25.178
I've-I've been meaning
to find someone

07:25.212 --> 07:27.447
to help me transcribe this
into a book.

07:27.481 --> 07:29.617
I'd love that.
Listening to your life story?

07:29.650 --> 07:30.918
Let me do it.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.553
-You'd do that?
-Yeah.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.788
All right. That would be
very helpful, Kyle. Thank you.

07:34.822 --> 07:36.289
Hey, you can use my office.

07:36.323 --> 07:37.958
All right, yeah.
I'll get started right now.

07:37.991 --> 07:40.661
-Okay, bring it in. Come on.
-(Chuck and Ed chuckle)

07:43.831 --> 07:45.332
Oh, no.

07:45.365 --> 07:47.601
I just wiped out 1979.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.971
Hang on, hang on.
There should be...

07:51.004 --> 07:53.440
a repair tool in here somewhere.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.475
Here we go.

07:59.146 --> 08:02.816
This baby will be as good as new
in about 40 minutes.

08:02.850 --> 08:05.753
*

08:05.786 --> 08:07.621
How'd your meeting go with CeCe?

08:07.655 --> 08:10.257
Oh, it was fab, it was rad,
it was... it was sick,

08:10.290 --> 08:12.660
it was, uh, off the chain,
over the brain.

08:12.693 --> 08:15.596
I think that woman just makes
stuff up as she goes along.

08:15.629 --> 08:17.631
Yeah, well, you know,
at least she got the chance

08:17.665 --> 08:18.999
to meet a real rep.

08:19.032 --> 08:21.001
Might turn out to be
a good connection for her.

08:21.034 --> 08:23.103
You know, I wish she had
a connection to reality,

08:23.136 --> 08:27.140
not the magical Wizard of Oz
world in CeCe's brain.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.142
Hello, beautiful fam.

08:29.176 --> 08:32.479
Wow. This meeting certainly
put you in a good mood.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.682
You were so discouraged
this morning.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.584
And now I'm the opposite.

08:36.617 --> 08:38.451
I'm couraged.

08:40.087 --> 08:42.089
CeCe P loved all my new ideas.

08:42.122 --> 08:44.391
-Oh, good.
-That's great, but don't get
too excited about that.

08:44.424 --> 08:46.093
She likes a lot of new ideas.

08:46.126 --> 08:48.328
We're going
into business together.

08:48.361 --> 08:49.663
MIKE:
Hey, hey.

08:49.697 --> 08:52.700
Mikey B no likey.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.267
*

09:00.440 --> 09:02.843
You're going into business
with CeCe?

09:02.876 --> 09:04.745
Uh, but she's
a manufacturer's rep.

09:04.778 --> 09:06.847
Yeah, she represents
all the young designers

09:06.880 --> 09:08.849
who are changing the game.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.550
So she's gonna represent
all the designs

09:10.584 --> 09:12.185
you've been creating
on your website?

09:12.219 --> 09:14.354
No, no.
All the new ideas

09:14.387 --> 09:16.624
that I came up with today.

09:16.657 --> 09:18.358
(clears throat)

09:18.391 --> 09:21.461
Leggings. Jackets. Vests.

09:21.494 --> 09:24.431
There were shoes,
but I spilled soup on them.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.200
Well, listen, I'm...

09:27.234 --> 09:29.102
I'm sorry I wasn't
excited before.

09:29.136 --> 09:31.038
I had no idea
you had already gotten

09:31.071 --> 09:32.873
to the cocktail napkin stage.

09:32.906 --> 09:36.509
Now, Mike, you know,
a lot of great partnerships

09:36.543 --> 09:38.746
started on a cocktail napkin.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.681
(Mike chuckles)

09:40.714 --> 09:42.582
First night I met your mom,

09:42.616 --> 09:45.552
she gave me her phone number
on a cocktail napkin.

09:45.585 --> 09:49.823
-And then it was off
to the volleyball races.
-Kicky-ka-pow!

09:49.857 --> 09:52.592
-You don't even know what...
-(Mandy grunts)

09:52.626 --> 09:53.927
No.

09:55.228 --> 09:56.563
So, CeCe said that

09:56.596 --> 09:58.598
as soon as I can get her
the merchandise,

09:58.632 --> 10:00.400
she's actually certain
that she can place it.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.202
-Oh. You hear that, Mike?
-Wow.

10:02.235 --> 10:04.738
-Yeah.
-So all you have to do is

10:04.772 --> 10:07.641
turn these sketches on napkins
into leggings and jackets

10:07.675 --> 10:09.943
and vests, oh, my.

10:10.978 --> 10:12.479
Not a problem.

10:12.512 --> 10:14.247
Yes, it is, honey.
It is a problem,

10:14.281 --> 10:15.749
'cause that means inventory.

10:15.783 --> 10:17.785
Inventory is capital.
That's money.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.853
You don't have the money.

10:19.887 --> 10:22.089
Not yet.
I think I know how to get it.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.124
Hmm. You hear that, Mike?

10:24.157 --> 10:26.660
Yeah, you guys always say
how-how much you believe in me.

10:26.694 --> 10:28.128
Here's your chance to prove it.

10:30.430 --> 10:33.767
You give me the money.

10:34.802 --> 10:37.004
Hear that, Vanessa?

10:38.438 --> 10:41.274
*

10:41.308 --> 10:42.976
-(laughs)
-CHUCK: Kyle.

10:43.010 --> 10:45.679
-Oh!
-Hey. Whoa. (chuckles)

10:45.713 --> 10:47.915
Uh, you-you've been at it
all day. How's it going?

10:47.948 --> 10:52.886
Oh, it has been "write for five,
laugh for seven."

10:52.920 --> 10:54.955
His stories are that funny?

10:54.988 --> 10:57.057
Oh, you tell me.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.559
Oh, shoot. Okay.

10:59.592 --> 11:01.762
Oh, here we go.
(laughs)

11:01.795 --> 11:05.532
All right. "July 10, 1991.

11:05.565 --> 11:08.836
"Had eggs this morning.
They were runny.

11:08.869 --> 11:11.905
"I don't like runny eggs.

11:11.939 --> 11:14.174
"July 11, 1991.

11:14.207 --> 11:17.745
Eggs again. Still runny.
Must be the pan."

11:17.778 --> 11:19.546
(laughs)
Right?

11:19.579 --> 11:22.015
"Must be the pan."

11:22.049 --> 11:24.084
Kyle, this is not funny.

11:24.117 --> 11:26.086
What? No, y-you have
to read it like him.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.255
Um, okay, uh...

11:28.288 --> 11:32.025
(impersonating Ed):
"Just changed the 75-watt bulbs
in my house to 60s.

11:32.059 --> 11:34.127
We'll see how it goes."

11:34.161 --> 11:36.463
Still not funny.

11:36.496 --> 11:39.066
(regular voice):
Shoot. I know.

11:39.099 --> 11:40.768
-It's just so boring.
-Yeah.

11:40.801 --> 11:42.803
You know, and I-I just thought
maybe it's funny

11:42.836 --> 11:46.106
-and I didn't get it,
like... like Dane Cook.
-(Chuck sighs)

11:46.139 --> 11:49.176
"WDZT weather girl
is phoning it in.

11:49.209 --> 11:52.679
We had a record high today.
She didn't seem interested."

11:54.114 --> 11:55.382
Kyle.

11:55.415 --> 11:58.318
I-I just don't get it.
His life was really interesting.

11:58.351 --> 12:00.988
I know. I mean,
he's full of great stories.

12:01.021 --> 12:03.590
But, huh, none of them
are in here.

12:03.623 --> 12:06.827
Hey, maybe we can just,
you know, burn all the tapes

12:06.860 --> 12:08.261
and say it was an accident.

12:08.295 --> 12:09.863
Like, uh...
ooh, like I was welding,

12:09.897 --> 12:11.531
and then the cow
kicked over a lantern.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.566
(chuckles):
Okay, Kyle, Kyle, get a grip.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.969
I-I'll... I'll help you
figure this out.

12:16.003 --> 12:20.140
-Thanks, Mr. Larabee.
-Yeah. And he's not wrong about
the WDZT weather girl.

12:20.173 --> 12:22.275
It's like she's better
than the weather.

12:23.977 --> 12:26.513
*

12:26.546 --> 12:27.714
VANESSA:
Honey?

12:27.747 --> 12:30.984
-Hmm?
-Hey. Hi.

12:31.018 --> 12:32.953
Uh, look, I want to reopen
our conversation

12:32.986 --> 12:34.587
about helping Mandy.

12:34.621 --> 12:36.523
You know, this is why I hide
in the corner here.

12:36.556 --> 12:39.659
Look, she is just getting
her confidence back.

12:39.692 --> 12:41.461
She could take this opportunity

12:41.494 --> 12:43.763
and run with it
if she only had the money.

12:43.797 --> 12:46.033
And-and she's right--
we have the money.

12:46.066 --> 12:50.037
We should load up the truck
and move to Beverly.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.539
Honey, we've saved the money
so we'd have something

12:52.572 --> 12:54.007
to leave our kids, right?

12:54.041 --> 12:56.276
You know what I-I want
to leave our kids, Mike,

12:56.309 --> 12:58.745
is-is the knowledge
that we believe in them.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.781
But she wants to launch
an entire line all at once.

13:01.815 --> 13:03.716
I know.
Look, she's got a lot of ideas.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.652
She's always had
a lot of ideas. You know...

13:05.685 --> 13:09.122
Every Christmastime, she'd come
to me with the perfect idea

13:09.156 --> 13:11.258
-for the best gift for her mom.
-Hmm.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.760
-And as a dad,
you didn't like that?
-Yeah, no, but then...

13:13.793 --> 13:15.495
then, the next day,
she'd have another idea.

13:15.528 --> 13:18.031
And then the next day, and
the next day, all these ideas.

13:18.065 --> 13:19.632
Now, pretty soon,
she had 20 ideas

13:19.666 --> 13:21.935
for the perfect gift
for the best mom in the world.

13:21.969 --> 13:24.872
-She's getting our money.
-(Mike chuckles)

13:24.905 --> 13:27.240
It's-it's wonderful
that she has a lot of ideas,

13:27.274 --> 13:29.977
but Mandy has got to learn
th-the big part of this

13:30.010 --> 13:31.411
is the follow-through.

13:31.444 --> 13:34.081
Okay. Look, you know...
(sighs)

13:34.114 --> 13:36.950
the hardest kids for me to tutor
are the gifted ones,

13:36.984 --> 13:39.119
because they think they're right
even when they're wrong.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.353
Like Mandy.

13:40.387 --> 13:42.089
If this was physics,

13:42.122 --> 13:44.357
I would know how to work
with her, but it's business.

13:44.391 --> 13:48.061
Are you saying that you want
to teach Mandy physics?

13:48.095 --> 13:51.831
(chuckles) No. But I'm saying
I can't teach her business,

13:51.865 --> 13:53.266
and you can.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.135
Can I?

14:03.176 --> 14:05.645
Hey, Mike Baxter here
for Outdoor Man.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.515
I'm thinking about outer space.

14:08.548 --> 14:12.519
I mean, can there really be
anything beyond infinity?

14:17.891 --> 14:20.693
Sometimes I look up
at the moon, I think,

14:20.727 --> 14:23.063
"Neil Armstrong walked on that."

14:23.096 --> 14:25.332
Imagine leading
such an interesting life

14:25.365 --> 14:27.634
that bailing out of your plane
over Korea

14:27.667 --> 14:31.204
was the second-most interesting
thing you did.

14:31.238 --> 14:33.706
Now, before ol' Neil took
one giant leap for mankind,

14:33.740 --> 14:36.776
he took a bunch of smaller steps
to prepare for the big one.

14:36.809 --> 14:39.812
Aeronautical engineer,
Navy aviator, test pilot,

14:39.846 --> 14:41.514
Eagle Scout-- "Hey, look, Ma,

14:41.548 --> 14:45.652
I got my Walked on the Moon
merit badge."

14:45.685 --> 14:47.854
Seems to me, these days,
everybody wants to skip

14:47.887 --> 14:50.023
the small steps
and just start on the moon.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.925
But if you miss the lessons
you were supposed

14:51.959 --> 14:54.461
to learn on the journey,
you won't be Neil Armstrong.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.196
(chuckles)
You'll be more like Laika,

14:56.229 --> 14:58.431
the Russian dog shot into space.

14:58.465 --> 15:01.301
Yeah. Would've been better
with Astro, right?

15:01.334 --> 15:04.371
"George. Reorge, Reorge.
Where are the retrorockets?

15:04.404 --> 15:06.706
Reorge?"

15:06.739 --> 15:08.808
Listen, you know me
as Outdoor Man,

15:08.841 --> 15:10.643
but there were quite a few
other things

15:10.677 --> 15:12.079
on that ladder before that.

15:12.112 --> 15:14.847
Outdoor House Painter,
where one wrong move

15:14.881 --> 15:16.583
and you'd learn
all about gravity.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.851
(chuckles)
Believe me, my brother did.

15:18.885 --> 15:21.288
Man, that was kind of funny.

15:21.321 --> 15:23.556
The good news is
you dedicate yourself

15:23.590 --> 15:25.325
and you lay it down
brick by brick,

15:25.358 --> 15:27.194
you can build
just about anything,

15:27.227 --> 15:29.196
even a bridge to infinity.

15:29.229 --> 15:31.731
Maybe even... beyond.

15:38.305 --> 15:39.472
Baxter out.

15:43.576 --> 15:44.911
-(chuckling)
-Ooh.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.446
Finally, finally.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.215
Is Kyle still working in there?

15:48.248 --> 15:50.050
-Because I'm ready
to read something.
-(chuckles)

15:50.083 --> 15:53.186
Uh, there's a lot of stuff
to go through, Ed.

15:53.220 --> 15:55.788
I-I told him
to select the highlights

15:55.822 --> 15:58.925
and let you pick
the most interesting stuff.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.493
That's good.
That sounds very smart.

16:00.527 --> 16:02.729
-That way, we can get
the first volume out quick.
-Ah.

16:02.762 --> 16:04.464
It'll be quick.

16:04.497 --> 16:05.798
-(chuckles)
-Mm-hmm.

16:05.832 --> 16:07.200
Kyle?

16:07.234 --> 16:09.569
Okay. All right. Uh,

16:09.602 --> 16:12.572
this is everything
that we found interesting.

16:12.605 --> 16:15.742
Oh, hope you enjoyed
the mountaintop, J.K. Rowling.

16:15.775 --> 16:18.145
(laughing)

16:18.178 --> 16:21.348
This... Okay, that's, uh...

16:24.017 --> 16:26.086
That's it?
This is everything,

16:26.119 --> 16:27.754
-one little piece of paper?
-CHUCK: Oh, um,

16:27.787 --> 16:29.256
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
That's a mistake.

16:29.289 --> 16:30.890
Let me, um...

16:36.296 --> 16:38.265
This is all you have?

16:38.298 --> 16:40.333
My whole life is on those tapes.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.502
-(Chuck sighs)
-No, it-it isn't. It's just...

16:42.535 --> 16:44.337
It's-it's stories, uh,

16:44.371 --> 16:46.106
about light bulbs and eggs

16:46.139 --> 16:49.242
and-and how you like snaps
better than buttons.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.179
Well, they're faster.

16:52.212 --> 16:54.381
Not on your tape.

16:54.414 --> 16:56.483
Well, I wasn't
just about to jump right

16:56.516 --> 16:59.086
into the personal stuff.
I was-I was leading up to it.

16:59.119 --> 17:01.321
But when were
you gonna get there, Ed?

17:01.354 --> 17:04.657
On one tape, you mentioned
spearmint gum six times.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.426
Where was that leading?

17:07.494 --> 17:10.230
It was 1968.

17:10.263 --> 17:14.834
A young Private Alzate
just landed in Vietnam.

17:14.867 --> 17:18.671
And a guy I just-just met...

17:18.705 --> 17:21.141
could tell that I was scared
out of my gourd.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.612
And he said, "I'm gonna give you
something to remind you of home

17:25.645 --> 17:28.047
until you get back there, kid."

17:28.081 --> 17:32.219
And he handed me
a pack of spearmint gum.

17:32.252 --> 17:34.387
It's, uh...
it's-it's spearmint gum.

17:34.421 --> 17:36.389
Simple, I know.

17:36.423 --> 17:38.825
But it made a difference.

17:38.858 --> 17:40.727
I...

17:40.760 --> 17:43.530
That's why I always
have one of these on me.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.198
Always, always.

17:46.199 --> 17:48.501
-Damn.
-ED: Mm.

17:48.535 --> 17:51.871
Now I'm curious about the snaps.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.441
-I'm a storyteller, all right?
-Yeah.

17:54.474 --> 17:57.410
I just... I just can't sit
in front of a microphone.

17:57.444 --> 17:59.879
It's not the same
as talking to people in a...

17:59.912 --> 18:02.014
at a bar, on a boat or...

18:02.048 --> 18:04.217
at a urinal.

18:04.251 --> 18:07.654
If you ever want someone
to tell these stories to, sir,

18:07.687 --> 18:10.190
I-I would gladly
write them down.

18:10.223 --> 18:11.391
Really?

18:11.424 --> 18:13.059
-Yeah.
-Hmm.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.261
Deal.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.863
-(chuckles) Hey.
-All right.

18:16.896 --> 18:20.066
-Hey, so, what do you want me
to do with those old tapes, Ed?
-All right. Yeah.

18:20.099 --> 18:24.003
Um, same as I told Nixon one
night we were drunk together:

18:24.036 --> 18:26.038
erase them.

18:27.807 --> 18:30.009
-(door closes)
-(chuckling)

18:30.042 --> 18:31.711
Who's Nixon?

18:33.146 --> 18:36.183
*

18:36.216 --> 18:37.850
Hey. Glad you're here.

18:37.884 --> 18:40.453
-Ooh, a bag of money!
-(chuckles)

18:40.487 --> 18:42.955
No. But I do want
to talk about that.

18:42.989 --> 18:44.524
Oh, I know what you're doing.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.293
You're doing that thing
where you're all serious,

18:46.326 --> 18:48.528
because you're a gruff dad
with bad news,

18:48.561 --> 18:50.630
but, really,
you're just messing with me

18:50.663 --> 18:53.900
because you think it's funny
when people hate you.

18:53.933 --> 18:55.868
No.

18:55.902 --> 18:58.671
Designing an entire line
of clothes is hard,

18:58.705 --> 19:02.175
and it's very impressive,
but it's just too much, Mandy.

19:02.209 --> 19:04.811
(sighs)
CeCe thinks I can do it.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.979
Why don't you ask CeCe
for the money?

19:07.013 --> 19:08.281
I did.

19:08.315 --> 19:10.983
Twice.

19:11.017 --> 19:13.119
What am I supposed to do?

19:13.152 --> 19:15.555
You're supposed to do this.

19:15.588 --> 19:17.156
Mountain climbing pants?

19:17.190 --> 19:20.493
Trying to tell me
to jump off a cliff?

19:20.527 --> 19:23.496
Okay, listen,
you need money for inventory.

19:23.530 --> 19:26.499
-Mm-hmm.
-Well, I've got a lot
of inventory that's not selling.

19:26.533 --> 19:28.335
Okay?

19:28.368 --> 19:32.104
Do you think you could work
your design magic

19:32.138 --> 19:34.173
on these mountain climbing pants

19:34.207 --> 19:37.710
and turn them into
hot-selling athleisure wear?

19:37.744 --> 19:39.679
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.850
Yeah. Okay.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.785
If I work my magic on these,

19:45.818 --> 19:48.521
I can get all those bitches
in your britches.

19:51.391 --> 19:54.261
Gross.
That came out wrong.

19:54.294 --> 19:56.128
Okay.

19:56.162 --> 19:58.665
Listen, if we can sell these--

19:58.698 --> 20:01.434
and I think we can
if you do your magic on 'em--

20:01.468 --> 20:03.102
I can guarantee you,
some of the profits

20:03.135 --> 20:04.704
Outdoor Man
will invest in inventory

20:04.737 --> 20:06.273
in one of your designs.

20:06.306 --> 20:09.141
And invest those earnings
in the next design.

20:09.175 --> 20:11.344
Yeah. One step at a time.
Brick by brick.

20:11.378 --> 20:12.679
That's how we do it.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.381
Dad,

20:14.414 --> 20:18.184
I think we just invented
a great way to do business.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.553
(chuckles)

20:21.554 --> 20:23.923
Did we?

20:30.263 --> 20:32.499
-Hey, Celia.
-Mm-hmm.

20:32.532 --> 20:35.001
A little birdie told me
that you're gonna sell

20:35.034 --> 20:37.003
Mandy's athleisure pants.

20:37.036 --> 20:40.039
Why you got to do me dirty, son?

20:40.072 --> 20:44.076
I know I'm gonna regret
saying this, but what?

20:44.110 --> 20:46.245
Mandy pitched those to me first,

20:46.279 --> 20:50.517
so I deserve a piece
of the action, okurrr?

20:50.550 --> 20:52.785
You know, I figured
you were gonna talk about this

20:52.819 --> 20:54.421
after I got your phone call,

20:54.454 --> 20:56.088
so I-I wanted to introduce you
to some associates.

20:56.122 --> 20:58.090
Hey, guys, step in for a second.

20:58.124 --> 21:00.360
-This is Celia right here.
-Mm.

21:00.393 --> 21:03.396
Ms. Powers, we're
Mr. Baxter's legal counsel,

21:03.430 --> 21:05.398
from the firm of James, Earl...

21:05.432 --> 21:07.233
(deep voice):
and Jones.

21:13.473 --> 21:16.108
Look, as you had
no contractual preemptive right

21:16.142 --> 21:18.778
pursuant to Ms. Baxter's pitch,
any claim to proprietorship

21:18.811 --> 21:20.380
is spurious and, well...

21:20.413 --> 21:22.615
(chuckles)
laughable.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.419
Oh, look at the time.

21:26.453 --> 21:27.587
(chuckles)

21:27.620 --> 21:30.823
I'm late for goat yoga, so...

21:30.857 --> 21:33.025
Call me.

21:33.059 --> 21:34.761
You, too.

21:38.097 --> 21:39.566
(chicken clucks)

21:39.599 --> 21:41.601
