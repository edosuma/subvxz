00:30.066 --> 00:31.429
How long have you been shooting this?

00:31.430 --> 00:33.274
17 years, baby.

00:33.410 --> 00:36.443
While my stupid classmates were all
building friendships and self-esteem,

00:36.502 --> 00:38.868
I was building a death star
out of popsicle sticks.

00:39.025 --> 00:41.987
Did you hear that?
They've shut down the main reactors.

00:42.224 --> 00:43.432
We'll be destroyed for--

00:43.515 --> 00:45.156
Dad!

00:45.832 --> 00:48.709
We'll be destroyed for sure.
This is madness!

00:48.725 --> 00:50.089
Spoiler alert!

00:50.090 --> 00:51.240
I play all the characters.

00:51.492 --> 00:53.992
Yahoo! You're all clear, kid.

00:53.993 --> 00:55.719
Now let's blow this thing and go home!

00:59.127 --> 01:00.537
Spoiler alert!

01:00.765 --> 01:01.595
You die a virgin.

01:01.596 --> 01:03.718
Oh, baby, I couldn't
sleep a wink last night.

01:03.719 --> 01:05.734
It's either 'cause of
that 9-hour energy drink,

01:05.762 --> 01:07.836
or 'cause today I'm finally
getting to meet your dad.

01:08.003 --> 01:10.193
Babe, he's gonna love you. Trust me.

01:10.194 --> 01:12.835
I know, but I wanna make a good
impression when he gets here,

01:12.894 --> 01:15.300
so I decided to wear underwear.

01:16.029 --> 01:19.354
Yeah, this tiger does not like to be caged.

01:21.010 --> 01:22.374
Cool. You're dad's coming to visit?

01:22.509 --> 01:24.280
Yeah. I know. It's been forever.

01:24.281 --> 01:26.107
Lucky. My parents are all over me.

01:26.108 --> 01:28.537
"When are you gonna come visit?
Why don't you have a girlfriend?

01:28.556 --> 01:30.259
It's okay if you're... you know."

01:30.260 --> 01:34.275
Well, uh, my dad's kinda sorta
been in jail the last five years.

01:34.802 --> 01:37.370
Fun-comfortable.

01:37.371 --> 01:40.428
No, guys, it's fine.
I'm just really excited to have him back.

01:40.429 --> 01:42.363
I mean, the guy taught
me everything I know.

01:44.116 --> 01:46.203
My very own lock picking case!

01:46.204 --> 01:48.728
The rest of your gifts are out
there somewhere, sweetheart.

01:48.729 --> 01:50.054
Now go get 'em.

01:50.481 --> 01:51.593
Look at this report card.

01:51.756 --> 01:54.949
I can't believe you forged
my signature like this.

01:55.204 --> 01:57.331
How many times have I told you?

01:57.563 --> 01:59.897
I loop my y's.

02:00.561 --> 02:03.381
Wow. Your childhood sounds
really interesting.

02:03.382 --> 02:06.100
Me--I was just raised by
couple of lesbian astronauts.

02:06.101 --> 02:08.309
Bye, sweetie.
Your mom and I are going back to space.

02:08.402 --> 02:09.336
Lame.

02:10.253 --> 02:14.419
Well, my dad's the best.
He sent me one of these postcards

02:14.420 --> 02:16.429
every month for the last five years,

02:16.430 --> 02:18.115
telling me how proud he was of me.

02:18.261 --> 02:21.580
I'm gonna be just--
Silence, woman! It's Ana Ng!

02:22.113 --> 02:23.901
Dang!

02:40.958 --> 02:42.504
Hey. Oz is calling a team meeting.

02:42.594 --> 02:43.602
I love you.

02:43.698 --> 02:46.326
And I-I mean, I don't love you...
like that.

02:46.327 --> 02:48.590
I mean, I say that a lot
'cause I live with my mom.

02:48.736 --> 02:49.362
Damn it.

03:09.584 --> 03:12.687
What you are looking at
is an exact scale replica

03:12.688 --> 03:14.696
of the Culver Modern Art Museum.

03:14.697 --> 03:16.043
Check out the detail on that--Ow!

03:16.044 --> 03:19.059
No touchy, Dutchy.
This thing cost me 800 bucks.

03:19.291 --> 03:21.547
I asked Creepy Carol to mock it up for me,

03:21.548 --> 03:24.034
and apparently, I "didn't
set a price limit."

03:24.035 --> 03:25.113
You never set a price limit.

03:25.486 --> 03:26.924
I "wasn't clear."

03:26.925 --> 03:28.158
You weren't very clear.

03:28.690 --> 03:30.743
I'm "so scary I make her tinkle."

03:31.660 --> 03:32.713
Uh-oh.

03:33.225 --> 03:34.209
I digress.

03:34.343 --> 03:36.647
The museum has hired us
to test their security.

03:36.648 --> 03:39.323
And if we break in, we get
paid to revamp their system.

03:39.324 --> 03:40.451
Cha-ching!

03:40.649 --> 03:43.684
So I've decided we are going
to break in and steal this.

03:43.734 --> 03:45.627
It's their most expensive piece of art.

03:45.763 --> 03:48.262
Uh, I-I think your screen's broken.

03:48.263 --> 03:51.552
No, no. It's not broken. This is the piece.

03:51.553 --> 03:53.828
It's called "White on White on White,"

03:53.829 --> 03:55.598
and it's worth $10 million.

03:55.599 --> 03:58.484
$10 million? What, for a blank canvas?

03:58.549 --> 04:00.860
I bet you if it was called
"Black on Black on Black."

04:00.861 --> 04:02.097
it'd be worthless.

04:02.209 --> 04:03.885
Social commentary.

04:04.075 --> 04:06.420
That ain't art. No...

04:07.426 --> 04:09.644
This is art. Yep.

04:09.667 --> 04:12.509
It's a tattoo of tattoo.

04:12.569 --> 04:16.202
Huh? Think about that one.
Whose mind did I just blow? All y'alls!

04:16.309 --> 04:18.260
Clearly, you all lack the sophistication

04:18.261 --> 04:20.932
to appreciate the nuance of this piece.

04:21.373 --> 04:24.741
Everybody, just take a moment
and really look at it.

04:24.749 --> 04:26.518
I mean, lean in.

04:26.939 --> 04:30.416
Allow the power of the paint
to--to wash over you.

04:31.621 --> 04:33.794
Ha ha! Art! God! Every time!

04:33.795 --> 04:38.564
All right, rule number 22--
He who mocks it least is in charge.

04:38.569 --> 04:41.023
And the "he" this time is Melanie.

04:41.272 --> 04:44.269
Hey, I'm Melanie.
I'm teacher's pet. Oz loves me!

04:44.424 --> 04:47.854
I'm Josh. I can't take a deuce
at work, so I drive home.

04:47.855 --> 04:48.940
Oz, make her stop.

04:49.291 --> 04:50.456
That's my girl.

04:50.824 --> 04:52.047
Oh, my God! Dad!

04:52.920 --> 04:53.965
Well, well.

04:53.966 --> 04:57.135
A little impromptu family reunion.
Isn't that nice?

04:57.238 --> 04:58.640
Hey, Cam. 
No freaking way!

04:58.641 --> 05:00.582
I'm like a Steve Miller band reunion tour.

05:01.149 --> 05:02.467
Dads love me.

05:05.037 --> 05:06.482
'Sup, old slice?

05:06.820 --> 05:08.432
Dutch Nilbog.

05:09.479 --> 05:10.699
Hey, man, I just want you to know

05:10.700 --> 05:12.114
that I think the world of your daughter,

05:12.159 --> 05:13.588
and nothing would make me happier

05:13.589 --> 05:14.860
than gettin' to know the
man who spawned her.

05:14.861 --> 05:17.466
So, uh, what do you say we
grab a couple four lokos,

05:17.467 --> 05:20.616
hit up the T-Bell, get our chalupa
on, and just keep it 100?

05:21.997 --> 05:23.479
I have no idea what he just said.

05:23.480 --> 05:25.500
He wants to split a beer with you, dad.

05:25.591 --> 05:27.741
Oh. Then, no. Dad!

05:27.853 --> 05:30.510
A'ight. Yeah, that's cool.
No, no, I'm just glad

05:30.546 --> 05:32.368
you're out of the clink
safe and sound, sir.

05:32.448 --> 05:35.759
Free at last! Oh, you just, uh,

05:35.760 --> 05:37.937
told a room full of
strangers I was in prison.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.560
Thanks, Dutch. 
No, no, no.

05:39.561 --> 05:42.159
I didn't mean...
like, the bad kind of prison,

05:42.160 --> 05:45.171
with the shank and then the... butt stuff.

05:46.819 --> 05:49.180
I'm wearing underwear. 
Okay.

05:49.486 --> 05:52.576
Well... you must be the boss man.

05:52.760 --> 05:54.287
Larry. 
I'm Oz.

05:54.288 --> 05:55.312
Hey, Oz.

05:55.318 --> 05:58.239
I wanna thank you for keeping my girl
gainfully employed these last five years.

05:58.599 --> 06:00.194
Well, your loss has been our gain.

06:00.195 --> 06:01.942
Melanie's a real asset to my team.

06:02.003 --> 06:04.931
Oh, dad. This is our hacker, Cameron. 
Hey.

06:05.144 --> 06:08.576
Oh. A hacker. I shared a cell with a hacker.
Oh, yeah?

06:08.577 --> 06:10.549
Killed his whole family with an ax.

06:10.550 --> 06:11.926
I hack computers.

06:11.927 --> 06:12.724
That's better.

06:12.793 --> 06:15.909
Hey, Mel, you think you can
carve out a little time today

06:15.910 --> 06:18.195
to hit up Billy's Burgers
with your old man?

06:18.227 --> 06:19.491
Like the old days?

06:19.492 --> 06:21.789
I know an invitation when I hear one.

06:22.869 --> 06:24.386
Let's grab some burgers! 
Oh.

06:25.517 --> 06:26.924
Seems like a nice guy.

06:27.072 --> 06:30.318
Oh, yeah, he's a real peach, for
a guy who's about to con us.

06:30.623 --> 06:32.201
Oh, come on. You don't even know him.

06:32.202 --> 06:34.220
Oh, I know him, but he doesn't know me.

06:34.388 --> 06:35.969
See, I'm the guy who put him away.

06:39.748 --> 06:41.677
If Oz asks, tell him I ran home.

06:41.678 --> 06:43.854
I have some...
personal business to take care of.

06:44.133 --> 06:45.707
It's gonna be a photo finish.

06:52.630 --> 06:55.475
Are you serious? You're the one
who put Melanie's dad in prison?

06:55.476 --> 06:57.745
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, chatty Cathy.

06:57.746 --> 07:00.306
At least let me activate
the Oz cone of silence.

07:00.332 --> 07:02.681
Cone activation initiated.

07:02.682 --> 07:05.390
There. Now everything we say is private.

07:05.391 --> 07:07.593
Take, for instance, all
the secrets I am privy to

07:07.594 --> 07:09.163
about the U.F.O. that crashed at Roswell.

07:09.305 --> 07:11.128
Let me tell you something, kid.
It happened.

07:16.178 --> 07:18.207
...Probes.
So what's on your mind?

07:18.823 --> 07:20.852
All this time, you're the
one who busted Larry,

07:20.853 --> 07:22.393
and nobody knows.

07:22.542 --> 07:25.955
Larry was working the long con.
Got himself a job at a bank,

07:25.956 --> 07:27.697
worked his way up to loan officer.

07:27.721 --> 07:30.464
Turns out, all the money
Larry was investing

07:30.466 --> 07:33.566
was going to his alias,
Mr. "Gordon Shumway," and mustaches.

07:33.738 --> 07:35.338
By the time the bank figured it out,

07:35.388 --> 07:38.674
Larry was long gone, and they
hired me to get the money back.

07:38.931 --> 07:42.585
What I didn't know at the time
was Larry had a daughter.

07:48.103 --> 07:50.195
So you felt bad and gave her a job.

07:50.196 --> 07:51.434
I never feel bad,

07:51.435 --> 07:53.316
but I got a world-class lock picker.

07:53.767 --> 07:56.573
The only thing is you can never
say a word about this to Melanie.

07:56.574 --> 07:59.167
This is a secret you and I
are taking to the grave.

07:59.168 --> 08:01.005
No, no, no, no, no. I'm not a part of this.

08:01.028 --> 08:02.020
Sure thing.

08:02.021 --> 08:04.226
Don't wink. Please stop winking.

08:04.420 --> 08:06.000
Gotcha.
You're still winking.

08:06.058 --> 08:08.233
I've been tracking Larry
for the last five years.

08:08.234 --> 08:11.318
Rule number seven--
A tiger never changes his spots.

08:11.465 --> 08:13.592
I'm pretty sure tigers don't have--

08:13.682 --> 08:14.873
Rule number eight--

08:14.918 --> 08:16.392
Never contradict me.

08:17.176 --> 08:18.067
Morning, Cash.

08:18.068 --> 08:19.681
Uh, technically, it's 12:30,

08:19.682 --> 08:21.326
so it would be "good afternoon."

08:22.294 --> 08:24.199
When you wake up, it'll be morning.

08:25.056 --> 08:27.039
Larry is here to con us.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.843
And we are gonna stop him.

08:30.977 --> 08:32.222
You want me to bug him?

08:32.224 --> 08:35.086
I'm not comfortable
spying on Melanie's dad.

08:35.087 --> 08:38.118
Let me tell you what isn't comfortable.
It's when something...

08:41.732 --> 08:43.086
...Lengthwise.

08:44.020 --> 08:45.930
Yes, that sounds very uncomfortable.

08:46.561 --> 08:47.331
Bye-bye.

08:49.571 --> 08:50.445
Okay, guys.

08:50.446 --> 08:53.024
I sent you encrypted e-mails
of the museum's schematics.

08:53.025 --> 08:55.758
Now once we're in the gallery,
we're gonna be up against one

08:55.759 --> 08:58.302
of the most state-of-the-art
high-tech security systems.

08:58.303 --> 09:00.535
Which won't be a problem if I
hack in and deactivate it.

09:00.587 --> 09:03.720
True, but there's also weight
sensors in the wall mountings.

09:03.721 --> 09:05.802
Which means we need to swap in
a duplicate white painting.

09:05.803 --> 09:07.464
Yeah. Not a problem. We're the best.

09:07.750 --> 09:09.061
What's up, my wookiees?

09:10.811 --> 09:13.209
And it was almost a normal meeting.

09:13.281 --> 09:15.439
Good news. I only got one more scene left

09:15.440 --> 09:16.642
in my "Star Wars" remake.

09:16.643 --> 09:18.519
It's the scene where Leia kisses Han Solo,

09:18.520 --> 09:20.507
but I haven't had any luck casting Leia.

09:21.324 --> 09:22.535
Ew. No.

09:22.645 --> 09:25.175
No, gracias. Yo tengo dignity.

09:25.353 --> 09:26.944
Boy, I'm your mother.

09:26.945 --> 09:29.288
How do you not see that that's weird?

09:29.718 --> 09:31.286
Why don't you just ask Ana Ng?

09:31.287 --> 09:33.247
The hottest woman in the universe?

09:35.853 --> 09:37.463
Why don't I just go back in time

09:37.464 --> 09:39.356
and not poop in my pants on prom night?

09:39.394 --> 09:40.561
I'm available.

09:41.592 --> 09:43.991
I can even do my own makeup. Watch.

09:46.937 --> 09:48.221
Oh, God. Oh...

09:49.097 --> 09:50.281
See? Camera-ready.

09:50.412 --> 09:53.663
Okay, but only because
everybody else said no.

09:53.743 --> 09:56.222
Oh, really? Yay! No other options.

09:56.740 --> 09:57.769
Hey, Melly belly.

09:58.094 --> 10:00.827
I'm sorry to interrupt, but I
have a little surprise for you.

10:00.828 --> 10:01.884
Come on. Give me a hand.

10:02.662 --> 10:03.669
What is it?

10:03.842 --> 10:05.870
Oh, I love that guy right there.

10:06.061 --> 10:08.261
He even offered to flat-iron
my wookiee beard.

10:08.412 --> 10:10.871
Gave me a bag of mustaches
from when he used to grift.

10:10.872 --> 10:13.386
Check it out--
Selleck, Trebek. Oh!

10:14.120 --> 10:15.766
Armenian cable guy.

10:15.830 --> 10:16.816
Bro, bro,

10:16.871 --> 10:19.750
you want sexy channels?
I hook you up. I hook you up.

10:19.751 --> 10:22.814
Oh, my God. Oz was right.
Larry's conned you guys.

10:22.815 --> 10:25.230
He's distracting you by telling
you what you wanna hear.

10:25.362 --> 10:26.874
What? No.

10:27.029 --> 10:29.866
Larry's a great guy. He even told us so.

10:30.114 --> 10:32.735
You know... I'm like... a great guy.

10:32.981 --> 10:35.810
Really. Great guy.

10:38.849 --> 10:40.369
Say good-bye...

10:40.789 --> 10:44.636
To another boring day of work, 'cause...
it's on!

10:44.637 --> 10:46.910
I used to play this all the time as a kid.

10:47.161 --> 10:48.208
Nerf war!

10:48.395 --> 10:50.944
And guess who won every time? Me!

10:50.945 --> 10:53.830
Oh. Okay, Cam, you're on my team,

10:54.249 --> 10:56.302
'cause I can tell you got
the killer instinct.

10:56.440 --> 10:57.471
All right.

10:57.873 --> 10:58.939
Let's do this. Yeah.

11:03.397 --> 11:05.603
Leeroy...

11:05.604 --> 11:08.126
Jenkins!

11:08.318 --> 11:10.624
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

11:11.193 --> 11:13.368
Got you! Got you! Got you! Got you!

11:14.757 --> 11:16.794
Okay, kiddo, it's just you and me now.

11:16.881 --> 11:19.629
And me. I'll take a bullet for you, dad.

11:19.630 --> 11:21.082
Is it cool if I call you "dad"?

11:23.199 --> 11:25.765
Oh. Friendly fire. Bummer.

11:29.505 --> 11:32.776
I don't like that bozo.
I don't want him dating my daughter.

11:32.884 --> 11:36.366
I was a con man. I read people.
That's what I do.

11:36.457 --> 11:38.412
Dutch isn't right for her. You are.

11:38.413 --> 11:40.306
I know what you're doing,
and it's not gonna work.

11:40.307 --> 11:41.333
Hold that thought, Charlie Brown.

11:41.334 --> 11:42.565
I gotta save your life.

11:43.659 --> 11:45.537
Sorry, buddy. You're out.

11:46.068 --> 11:47.309
All that work.

11:47.716 --> 11:48.731
You don't trust me.

11:48.946 --> 11:50.799
That's not true. I trust you.

11:51.534 --> 11:52.414
Really?

11:55.189 --> 11:56.200
All right.

11:57.829 --> 11:59.028
Let's do this.

12:00.599 --> 12:03.214
Relax, kid.
I know you're just doing your job.

12:03.215 --> 12:04.409
I wouldn't trust me either.

12:07.196 --> 12:08.025
Aah! Oh, damn it!

12:08.046 --> 12:09.418
I'm hit.

12:11.643 --> 12:12.773
Treat her well.

12:12.964 --> 12:14.777
You know you're not actually shot, right?

12:14.778 --> 12:16.430
Yeah, but I got a leg cramp.

12:16.810 --> 12:20.102
Nighty-night, bitches.
Bye, pops.

12:20.236 --> 12:22.926
Larry, I'll save ya!

12:28.209 --> 12:29.211
No!

12:31.673 --> 12:32.983
Way to go, Dutch.

12:32.987 --> 12:36.665
Whoo! I got mad air on that one, son.

12:37.016 --> 12:38.431
Maybe Oz won't notice.

12:39.689 --> 12:41.114
I noticed!

12:42.555 --> 12:44.427
Oh, everybody gets to play but me?

12:44.677 --> 12:46.768
Clean up this mess and get back to work.

13:05.249 --> 13:07.715
Thank you. Thank you.

13:08.145 --> 13:10.874
It took me, like, 12 takes
to get it down to that.

13:11.421 --> 13:12.188
I love you.

13:12.451 --> 13:13.782
I know.

13:22.042 --> 13:23.142
What do you guys think?

13:23.143 --> 13:25.004
It sucks!
What?

13:25.075 --> 13:26.286
How could Larry not like me?

13:26.516 --> 13:28.863
Six million people on this planet earth,

13:28.864 --> 13:29.885
and they all know I'm the man.

13:29.916 --> 13:31.037
How come he doesn't see it?

13:31.291 --> 13:32.739
Way to make it about you, Dutch.

13:32.834 --> 13:35.436
You're right.
This hasn't been enough about me.

13:35.543 --> 13:38.140
I am balls out awesome,
and I'm gonna show him.

13:38.970 --> 13:42.177
Whoo-hoo! Hey, boys.
Look what I made--pecan sandies.

13:42.178 --> 13:43.072
There you go.

13:43.121 --> 13:44.218
Oh. Wow, that's nice.

13:44.595 --> 13:46.617
Mother of pearl! What the hell?

13:46.802 --> 13:49.866
Rule number 32. Oz doesn't do nice things.

13:53.695 --> 13:55.151
Wakey, wakey, sweetheart!

13:55.551 --> 13:57.965
You were supposed to
plant that bug on Larry.

13:57.966 --> 13:58.700
What happened?

13:59.152 --> 14:00.239
He found it.

14:00.732 --> 14:03.243
And I'm glad he did, all right?
I mean, you got in my head.

14:03.244 --> 14:05.701
Larry's a nice guy, and he
wants what's best for Melanie.

14:05.702 --> 14:08.339
Oh, let me guess.
He said what's best for Melanie is you.

14:08.340 --> 14:11.423
How convenient. Just the thing
your little ears wanted to hear.

14:11.424 --> 14:13.318
No, no, there's no way he's playing me.

14:13.319 --> 14:13.822
Oh, really?
Yeah.

14:13.823 --> 14:16.139
Have you seen your phone lately?
'Cause I have.

14:17.018 --> 14:19.170
Is he--is he grabbing your booty?
Oh.

14:19.171 --> 14:21.761
Oh, looky here. Too much time in jail.

14:22.896 --> 14:24.364
And he played me.

14:25.076 --> 14:26.863
Bitch got played. Bitch got played.

14:28.097 --> 14:29.014
No!

14:38.211 --> 14:40.673
Thank you... Cameron.

14:43.222 --> 14:45.875
Where is it?
Hey.

14:46.032 --> 14:47.466
There's my future son-in-law.

14:47.467 --> 14:48.837
Stop! I want my phone--

14:48.838 --> 14:50.854
You know, the one you stole
to get all the museum info?

14:50.855 --> 14:53.771
Cammie, come on. It's me.
Hey, you know what--

14:53.772 --> 14:55.627
Eh!
No, no.

15:04.358 --> 15:06.896
No. It's in your underwear, isn't it?

15:06.897 --> 15:07.998
That would've been easier.

15:08.508 --> 15:11.557
Oh. Just went to voice mail.

15:12.207 --> 15:14.831
I can't believe you let Mel down like this.

15:14.904 --> 15:17.910
Oz was right. You're still
Gordon Shumway, pulling cons.

15:17.911 --> 15:20.183
How would Oz know my alias?

15:21.195 --> 15:23.250
I-I-don't know. It's a pretty common alias.

15:23.251 --> 15:25.261
I mean, it's one I would use,
if you think about it.

15:25.262 --> 15:27.083
No, the only people who know
that are the ones who busted me.

15:27.084 --> 15:29.884
Are you saying that Oz is the
bastard that put me in jail?

15:30.151 --> 15:31.182
No, I'm not saying that.

15:31.183 --> 15:32.108
That is not what I'm saying.

15:32.109 --> 15:33.355
That is the last thing I'm saying.

15:33.356 --> 15:36.286
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna find a baseball bat,

15:36.504 --> 15:39.277
and I'm gonna hit that
guy right in the face.

15:40.692 --> 15:42.652
Cone of silence! Cone of silence!

15:42.768 --> 15:44.153
Cone of silence! Cone of silence!

15:45.033 --> 15:47.743
Activate your cone of silence!
Cone of silence!

15:48.166 --> 15:49.570
Releasing toxins.

15:49.571 --> 15:50.886
Wrong button. Please evacuate.

15:51.758 --> 15:53.610
How's your tolerance to nerve agents?

15:53.611 --> 15:54.593
Not good.

15:54.595 --> 15:55.550
Then we should probably go.

15:55.662 --> 15:57.184
No, no, no. You can't go out there.

15:57.185 --> 15:59.250
I know you're gonna kill me,
but I told Larry everything.

15:59.251 --> 16:02.155
Excellent. That was faster than expected.
What?

16:02.156 --> 16:04.947
I needed to backdoor that
information to Larry,

16:04.948 --> 16:06.670
and I used your big mouth to do it.

16:06.671 --> 16:08.431
I didn't realize he was
gonna backdoor your phone,

16:08.432 --> 16:10.412
but sometimes things
slip through the crack.

16:10.910 --> 16:13.757
Wait, wait. Is this another
one of your insane Oz plans?

16:13.758 --> 16:15.874
Rule 11-- I always have a plan,

16:15.875 --> 16:19.225
and this time, it's to show
Melanie who her father really is.

16:19.226 --> 16:20.815
Once we do that, she can decide--

16:20.824 --> 16:22.899
Stay with us or join the dark side.

16:24.033 --> 16:27.703
Obi-Wan never told you what
happened to your father?

16:27.882 --> 16:29.236
He told me enough.

16:29.914 --> 16:31.685
He told me you killed him!

16:35.582 --> 16:36.783
You!

16:37.073 --> 16:37.995
Yeah, you!
Ooh, this should be fun.

16:37.996 --> 16:40.939
I want the last five years of my life back,

16:40.940 --> 16:41.903
you son of a bitch!

16:45.296 --> 16:46.557
Oh, come on!

16:46.949 --> 16:48.143
What the hell is going on here?

16:48.803 --> 16:51.552
Did you know that your boss here
is the one who put me away?

16:52.501 --> 16:53.827
Is that true?

16:53.888 --> 16:55.995
Don't look at me like I'm the bad guy here.

16:55.996 --> 16:57.880
I mean, he made you crooked.
I straightened you out.

16:57.881 --> 16:59.449
Oh, I never asked you to.

16:59.450 --> 17:01.373
I would have been fine on my own.

17:01.454 --> 17:04.337
Oz, you lied to me the last five years.

17:05.595 --> 17:06.670
Let's get outta here.

17:15.816 --> 17:18.973
Oswald, I'm gonna bounce, too.

17:19.534 --> 17:21.426
Little solidarity with my boy Larry.

17:21.553 --> 17:22.665
Turn your ass around.

17:22.665 --> 17:24.561
Change of plans. I'm sticking around!

17:26.915 --> 17:28.035
Well, we still have a job to do.

17:28.358 --> 17:30.234
Let's see if we can penetrate
this museum's security.

17:31.413 --> 17:32.487
Visual on target.

17:32.580 --> 17:34.228
Cracking into their wireless network now.

17:35.531 --> 17:36.870
And...

17:37.839 --> 17:39.698
Floor grid deactivated. We're going in.

17:39.699 --> 17:40.872
Okay, swapping in the dupe.

17:41.527 --> 17:45.474
Wait. Freeze. Don't move.
Grid just went live again.

17:45.475 --> 17:47.639
You take one more step, it's game over.

17:47.640 --> 17:49.912
What?
I hacked in and overrode the system.

17:50.088 --> 17:51.957
I think somebody overrode us.

17:52.316 --> 17:53.392
That's impossible.

17:58.266 --> 18:00.274
Thanks for the assist, boys.

18:02.514 --> 18:05.466
Larry's there? Tell him I said "hey."

18:05.589 --> 18:06.880
Dutch, shut up.

18:11.025 --> 18:12.943
Melanie, don't do this.
Once you take the painting,

18:12.944 --> 18:14.225
there's no coming back from that.

18:14.226 --> 18:16.147
I'm sorry, Cam.
I'm partners with my dad now,

18:16.148 --> 18:18.212
and that's all that matters to me.

18:18.305 --> 18:20.213
Hey, ask him if he wants to go
rollerblading with me later.

18:20.214 --> 18:21.638
Not now, Dutch.

18:21.639 --> 18:23.292
I just got a new pair of skates.

18:23.607 --> 18:25.581
Guys, don't move. The grid is still active.

18:25.582 --> 18:27.263
This has been one heck of a fiesta,

18:27.264 --> 18:28.834
but I think it's time
we call the federales.

18:28.835 --> 18:30.419
No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

18:30.497 --> 18:32.496
Come on. Just give her a
minute to come to her senses.

18:32.497 --> 18:34.405
She's a big girl. She's made her choice.

18:37.332 --> 18:38.429
Cash, call the cops.

18:38.430 --> 18:39.920
Tell him this is no false alarm.

18:39.921 --> 18:40.907
Okay, I'm on it.

18:42.932 --> 18:43.861
Damn it!

18:43.862 --> 18:45.574
Forget the paintings. Let's just go!

18:46.882 --> 18:48.123
Cam, grab the paintings.

18:48.299 --> 18:49.976
Okay. This is it.

18:51.220 --> 18:52.396
This is the real one.

18:52.403 --> 18:54.606
No, wait. This is.
Are you kidding me?

18:54.607 --> 18:56.297
Oh, dear God! They're all so white!

18:57.569 --> 19:01.985
Oh, God. It's the dupe.
I marked the back, which is good,

19:01.986 --> 19:03.508
because I do not have $10 million.

19:08.988 --> 19:11.179
Well, well, looky here.

19:11.180 --> 19:12.789
This is what I like to call a real pickle.

19:12.790 --> 19:14.718
Neither of us know which is the real one.

19:14.908 --> 19:16.855
I'll have to settle for 50/50.

19:18.508 --> 19:19.920
Larry...

19:20.878 --> 19:23.169
What if I told you I
could double your odds?

19:23.398 --> 19:25.223
Why would you wanna do something like that?

19:25.301 --> 19:26.828
I'll give you this painting

19:27.707 --> 19:31.153
if you promise to stay out of Melanie's life.
Deal.

19:31.564 --> 19:33.450
I just needed her for this job.
Oh!

19:34.149 --> 19:36.405
And, uh, Cam, just for the record,

19:37.331 --> 19:38.815
I still like you better than Dutch.

19:38.935 --> 19:40.923
Why?!
Ask him why!

19:41.136 --> 19:43.088
You gave him the painting?
That was your plan?

19:43.192 --> 19:44.406
The moment Larry showed up,

19:44.407 --> 19:46.425
I knew he was gonna make a
play for that painting.

19:47.349 --> 19:49.674
So while you guys were playing toy guns,

19:49.956 --> 19:53.297
I was at the museum
securing the real painting.

19:53.727 --> 19:55.120
Rule number one--

19:55.121 --> 19:56.538
Never question the plan.

19:56.539 --> 19:57.592
Man, I give up.

19:58.016 --> 19:59.530
I'm a good person!

20:03.017 --> 20:04.934
Hey.
Hey.

20:05.953 --> 20:07.190
How was your night?

20:07.265 --> 20:08.915
Well, same ol', same ol'.

20:09.278 --> 20:11.116
Really? We're not gonna talk about it?

20:11.428 --> 20:12.753
This place is so weird.

20:16.272 --> 20:17.805
You don't loop your y's.

20:18.284 --> 20:19.256
Come again?

20:19.645 --> 20:21.873
This morning, I looked at
the postcards from my dad.

20:22.869 --> 20:24.117
I know you wrote them.

20:24.651 --> 20:26.026
I don't know what you're talking about,

20:26.027 --> 20:29.042
but, uh, if I did, I meant every word.

20:29.800 --> 20:31.033
"I'm Oz.

20:31.141 --> 20:33.428
"I write postcards to
make Melanie feel better.

20:33.566 --> 20:36.155
I'm proud of her. I'm her family."

20:36.912 --> 20:38.454
Don't you ever forget it.

20:40.616 --> 20:43.445
Yo, check it!
Just uploaded my "Star Wars" film.

20:43.919 --> 20:45.784
I am your father.

20:47.442 --> 20:51.308
No!

20:51.596 --> 20:54.050
"Star Wars." I love that movie!

20:54.310 --> 20:56.065
You should've asked me to be Leia.

20:56.885 --> 21:00.044
Oh. Oh, well.
What-- what are you gonna do, huh?

21:00.831 --> 21:02.528
Would you excuse me for a minute?

21:03.756 --> 21:06.454
Cone activation initiated.

21:21.778 --> 21:24.735
We're going to the sexy world of Comic-Con

21:24.736 --> 21:27.226
to protect the geek holy grail.
Nerd-gasm.
