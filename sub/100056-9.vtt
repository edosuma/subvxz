WEBVTT

00:08.660 --> 00:10.401
All right, everyone,
listen up.

00:10.445 --> 00:12.186
Before we start rounds,
Dr. Frost

00:12.229 --> 00:14.231
has a very special
announcement.

00:14.275 --> 00:16.190
I certainly do.

00:16.233 --> 00:17.626
Today,
we are piloting

00:17.669 --> 00:20.107
a new program
to improve emotional support

00:20.150 --> 00:21.847
for our patients.[elevator dings]

00:21.891 --> 00:24.850
I'd like to introduce you
to our newest volunteers.

00:24.894 --> 00:26.330
CAROL:
Oh!

00:26.374 --> 00:28.158
[chuckling]

00:28.202 --> 00:31.031
These intrepid canines
will accompany you

00:31.074 --> 00:33.337
to visit patients
who have expressed
an interest in meeting them.

00:33.381 --> 00:35.122
And who have been medically
cleared for the visit,

00:35.165 --> 00:38.951
since dogs are unsanitary and
don't belong in a hospital.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.172
Just my opinion.
[chuckles]

00:42.216 --> 00:43.217
I'll leave you
to it.

00:43.260 --> 00:45.219
Have fun working
with your dog-tors.

00:45.262 --> 00:46.481
[laughs]

00:46.524 --> 00:48.613
I was thinking it,
but I didn't say it.

00:48.657 --> 00:50.006
Mm.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.312
This is so great.

00:51.355 --> 00:53.488
You know, research shows
that a therapy dog visit

00:53.531 --> 00:55.185
can really benefit
an anxious patient.

00:55.229 --> 00:58.014
Research also shows
that dogs aren't doctors.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.798
Nowadays, you stick
a vest on a dog,

00:59.842 --> 01:01.104
and, suddenly,
it can go anywhere.

01:01.148 --> 01:02.410
Okay, there's a difference
between that

01:02.453 --> 01:04.020
and a real service animal.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.674
All I'm saying is,
I was at a restaurant

01:05.717 --> 01:09.069
and a "real service animal"
stole my hamburger.

01:10.157 --> 01:11.332
I'm a cat person.

01:11.375 --> 01:14.900
I like an animal
that bends you to its will.

01:14.944 --> 01:17.686
All right,
we have actual humans

01:17.729 --> 01:19.470
who'd like our attention, too.

01:19.514 --> 01:20.993
Interns, let's move.

01:22.256 --> 01:24.301
Dogs, let's move.

01:26.173 --> 01:28.697
â™ª

01:28.740 --> 01:30.351
[beep]

01:35.443 --> 01:36.966
Oh, good, Macy.
You've already met

01:37.009 --> 01:38.228
one of our therapy dogs.Yeah.

01:38.272 --> 01:40.230
Finnegan's great.
He's a nice distraction.

01:40.274 --> 01:42.058
Keeping me chill.Oh, really?

01:42.102 --> 01:43.755
Sounds like he's being
very helpful.

01:43.799 --> 01:45.061
LEXIE:
Oh, yeah. I see

01:45.105 --> 01:47.237
he's already attached
her heart monitor leads.

01:47.281 --> 01:48.586
Oh, you didn't do that?

01:48.630 --> 01:49.587
'Cause you don't
have thumbs

01:49.631 --> 01:51.676
and you're just a dog?Mm-hmm.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.158
So, I understand you were
admitted from the ER

01:55.202 --> 01:56.986
this morning for
acute tendonitis?

01:57.029 --> 01:58.640
Yeah, I played tennis yesterday.

01:58.683 --> 02:00.381
And then, last night,
my arm started

02:00.424 --> 02:01.904
swelling
and cramping.

02:01.947 --> 02:03.035
It still hurts.

02:03.079 --> 02:04.559
Oh. Yeah.

02:04.602 --> 02:07.257
Yeah, I can see the swelling.
Still fairly pronounced.

02:07.301 --> 02:09.477
The ER doctor was concerned
that she isn't responding

02:09.520 --> 02:10.869
to ibuprofen.Mm.

02:10.913 --> 02:13.220
Ooh, your lymph
nodes are swollen.

02:13.263 --> 02:14.351
Were you ill recently?

02:14.395 --> 02:16.440
I had strep throat.When was that?

02:16.484 --> 02:19.051
Last week, but I had a Z-Pak
and it cleared up.

02:19.095 --> 02:20.792
Okay. Well,
we'll schedule an MRI

02:20.836 --> 02:22.098
and find out what's going on.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.100
Can Finnegan stay?

02:24.144 --> 02:26.972
Yes. He can also sit,
roll over

02:27.016 --> 02:28.931
and if there's any squirrels
in the room,

02:28.974 --> 02:30.150
he will find them.

02:32.326 --> 02:33.805
Mm.

02:33.849 --> 02:36.068
Seems like she's
really responding to Finnegan.

02:36.112 --> 02:37.722
I know you don't think
dogs are helpful,

02:37.766 --> 02:40.725
but I read about a woman
who was having a heart attack

02:40.769 --> 02:43.380
and her Pomeranian
called 911.

02:44.425 --> 02:45.730
Lexie?

02:45.774 --> 02:46.949
Huh?

02:46.992 --> 02:48.037
Yeah. 911's great.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.299
Easy to remember.

02:49.343 --> 02:50.692
Okay, what's wrong?

02:50.735 --> 02:52.998
Because that's more
than your usual level

02:53.042 --> 02:56.219
of disinterest
in my stories.

02:56.263 --> 02:58.134
Yeah, it's... nothing.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.396
Come on. What is it?

02:59.440 --> 03:01.355
I was just thinking
about Macy's swelling,

03:01.398 --> 03:02.747
plus her recent strep.

03:02.791 --> 03:04.967
It made me think of acute
compartment syndrome.

03:05.010 --> 03:06.229
ACS?

03:06.273 --> 03:08.188
That's very rare.Yeah.

03:08.231 --> 03:10.233
You're right.
Stupid idea.Wait, hold on.

03:10.277 --> 03:12.496
Are-are you thinking that
because of the strep infection?

03:12.540 --> 03:14.019
Yeah, if it spread
to her arm,

03:14.063 --> 03:15.282
it could be causing
the swelling.

03:15.325 --> 03:17.109
I mean, if you're right,
that's very serious.

03:17.153 --> 03:19.242
Maybe we should check
the pressure on her arm.

03:19.286 --> 03:20.635
But, again,
it's so rare.

03:20.678 --> 03:22.027
I don't want to put her
through a painful test

03:22.071 --> 03:23.290
just based on
my dumb hunch.

03:23.333 --> 03:25.205
It's not dumb.
Let's just check.

03:26.989 --> 03:28.904
Hey, Macy, listen,

03:28.947 --> 03:30.253
we're concerned
that the swelling

03:30.297 --> 03:32.255
in your arm is affecting
your circulation.

03:32.299 --> 03:34.736
So we just wanted
to run a little test.

03:34.779 --> 03:36.825
It's gonna hurt
just a tiny bit.

03:36.868 --> 03:39.088
Okay.

03:39.131 --> 03:41.482
So, take a deep breath.

03:41.525 --> 03:44.876
One, two, three.

03:45.877 --> 03:47.052
42 mmHg.

03:47.096 --> 03:48.750
I'll call Surgery.

03:48.793 --> 03:50.099
Wait, what?Listen, Macy,

03:50.142 --> 03:51.753
your strep has
spread to your arm,

03:51.796 --> 03:53.885
and the infected tissue is
cutting off circulation.

03:53.929 --> 03:55.539
You're gonna be fine,
but we have to get you

03:55.583 --> 03:56.758
to the OR immediately.

03:59.151 --> 04:00.544
Patient is a 45-year-old man

04:00.588 --> 04:03.112
admitted with chest pains
and light-headedness.

04:03.155 --> 04:04.853
We tested for a heart attack
and pulmonary embolism,

04:04.896 --> 04:06.289
but both tests
came back clean.

04:06.333 --> 04:09.118
His vitals are normal,
so our plan is to discharge.

04:09.161 --> 04:10.598
Oh. Well, Gordon,

04:10.641 --> 04:13.253
we hope you've enjoyed your
stay at Loyola Memorial.

04:13.296 --> 04:15.298
We know you have many options
when it comes to medical care,

04:15.342 --> 04:17.300
and we appreciate
you choosing us.

04:18.301 --> 04:20.477
I feel like a flight attendant.

04:20.521 --> 04:22.305
Take care,
Gordon.

04:22.349 --> 04:25.134
Actually, I-I probably should
have brought this up earlier,

04:25.177 --> 04:27.310
but I've also been feeling
pretty nauseous.

04:27.354 --> 04:29.791
Oh. How long has
this been going on?

04:29.834 --> 04:32.359
Well, it started
a few days ago at the gym.

04:32.402 --> 04:34.317
I mean, usually, just the idea
of going to the gym

04:34.361 --> 04:35.710
makes me sick.
[chuckles]Mm-hmm.

04:35.753 --> 04:38.278
But then I got nauseous
picking up groceries

04:38.321 --> 04:41.324
and then again golfing
w-with my wife and her dad.

04:41.368 --> 04:43.892
Mm. Very interesting.

04:43.935 --> 04:46.155
Wait, have you
felt a dull pain

04:46.198 --> 04:48.592
in the arch of your
foot and your ear?

04:48.636 --> 04:50.072
Actually,
a little of both.

04:50.115 --> 04:52.509
Ooh. Very interesting.

04:52.553 --> 04:55.207
You know, I'm gonna consult
with my colleagues.

04:55.251 --> 04:57.340
Uh, if you do need to vomit,

04:57.384 --> 05:00.343
try not to do it
near Noodles.

05:00.387 --> 05:02.171
She'll eat it.

05:04.216 --> 05:07.611
Well, I think it's pretty clear
what Gordon's ailment is.

05:07.655 --> 05:09.396
It is?

05:09.439 --> 05:12.399
Yes. He has appendic...

05:12.442 --> 05:14.792
Gall...

05:14.836 --> 05:15.793
Kidney...

05:15.837 --> 05:17.404
I don't know either.

05:17.447 --> 05:21.408
Well, this is a fantastic
exercise in medical deduction.

05:21.451 --> 05:24.062
Since the patient
is in no immediate danger,

05:24.106 --> 05:25.847
I'm gonna give you one hour
to figure out

05:25.890 --> 05:27.152
what Gordon's ailment is.

05:27.196 --> 05:29.241
And we can run
whatever tests we want?

05:29.285 --> 05:30.504
Mm, no tests.
Everything you need

05:30.547 --> 05:32.288
is either in this chart
or in that room.

05:32.332 --> 05:36.074
[gasps] Like a
medical escape room.

05:37.293 --> 05:38.381
I've never done one,

05:38.425 --> 05:40.601
because I'm not a total nerd.
[chuckles]

05:40.644 --> 05:42.254
I love them.

05:42.298 --> 05:44.344
Yeah! 'Cause
they're so much fun!

05:45.867 --> 05:46.824
Ah,

05:46.868 --> 05:48.130
the hour begins now.

05:48.173 --> 05:50.175
60, 59:59,

05:50.219 --> 05:51.699
59:58, 59:57--

05:51.742 --> 05:54.092
You know what,
I'm just gonna set a timer.

05:54.136 --> 05:56.617
The surgeons
are predicting

05:56.660 --> 05:59.533
that Macy will make
a full recovery.

05:59.576 --> 06:01.099
Great work.

06:01.143 --> 06:02.710
Did you hear that?

06:02.753 --> 06:05.930
Not decent, not pretty good,
not even full good-- great.

06:05.974 --> 06:09.020
Well, most new doctors wouldn't
have made the diagnostic leap

06:09.064 --> 06:10.761
to acute compartment syndrome.

06:10.805 --> 06:11.980
Most new doctors
didn't.

06:12.023 --> 06:13.285
It was all Dr. Gilani.

06:13.329 --> 06:15.636
If you think I am not buying
her a hot chocolate,

06:15.679 --> 06:18.334
you're crazy!

06:18.378 --> 06:19.553
Carol, stop it.

06:19.596 --> 06:20.858
It was a team effort.

06:20.902 --> 06:22.338
Okay,
you two.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.253
Take the compliment
and move on.

06:24.296 --> 06:26.081
Pfft.

06:26.124 --> 06:28.083
More people
have won the Super Bowl

06:28.126 --> 06:30.215
than have gotten a compliment
from Dr. Jacobs.

06:30.259 --> 06:31.347
You're a hero.[sighs]

06:31.391 --> 06:32.957
No, I'm not.

06:33.001 --> 06:35.003
Come on.
You saved a woman's arm.

06:35.046 --> 06:37.266
This girl deserves
a cheering section.

06:37.309 --> 06:38.441
Okay, Dennis,

06:38.485 --> 06:40.312
when I say "Lexie,"
you say "did it."

06:40.356 --> 06:42.532
Lexie!

06:42.576 --> 06:44.229
Lexie!

06:46.101 --> 06:47.189
Can we move on?

06:47.232 --> 06:48.669
I don't want to make
a big deal of it.

06:48.712 --> 06:52.020
If you don't broadcast
your successes, who will?

06:52.063 --> 06:54.196
Dennis?
Doesn't sound like it.

06:55.850 --> 06:57.373
Unless...

06:57.417 --> 06:58.418
Lexie!

06:58.461 --> 06:59.419
Come on!

07:01.595 --> 07:03.553
Carol, I said I don't want
to make a big deal of it.

07:03.597 --> 07:05.250
Let's just drop it.

07:08.384 --> 07:10.342
Did it! Did it!

07:14.042 --> 07:17.262
I could tell she wasn't in the
mood, but I love a good cheer.

07:18.742 --> 07:21.310
All right, let's solve
a medical mystery.

07:21.353 --> 07:23.138
Dr. Frost said it's obvious
and he mentioned ears,

07:23.181 --> 07:24.226
so let's start there.

07:24.269 --> 07:26.184
Hey, Gordon.
We are gonna figure out

07:26.228 --> 07:28.926
what's wrong with you in...
58 minutes.

07:28.970 --> 07:31.581
But if you don't do it
in that amount of time,

07:31.625 --> 07:33.931
you're still gonna keep trying,
right?

07:36.368 --> 07:38.370
Sure, sure, sure.

07:39.763 --> 07:42.549
He has no external signs
of infection.

07:42.592 --> 07:44.420
Light seborrheic dermatitis.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.117
[chuckles, snorts]
Kind of pointy.

07:46.161 --> 07:47.336
Hey!

07:47.379 --> 07:48.946
It's not like your ears
are so great.

07:48.990 --> 07:51.471
Buzz cut was a bold move
on your part.

07:56.171 --> 07:57.694
All right.

07:57.738 --> 08:00.741
Ear canals look normal.

08:00.784 --> 08:02.264
Uh, hey, Gordon,

08:02.307 --> 08:04.222
have you had any
vision problems recently?

08:04.266 --> 08:05.354
A little, yeah.

08:05.397 --> 08:09.271
But now I only have eyes
for Noodles.

08:09.314 --> 08:10.794
What about headaches?

08:10.838 --> 08:13.057
Now that you mention it,
I have had some headaches.

08:13.101 --> 08:15.625
[chuckles]: Oh, Caleb, get ready
to escape in record time.

08:15.669 --> 08:18.149
Chest pressure,
headaches, vision issues?

08:18.193 --> 08:20.891
Gordon has giant cell arteritis.Of course.

08:20.935 --> 08:22.414
Now all we need to do
is confirm

08:22.458 --> 08:24.112
his lymph nodes are swollen,

08:24.155 --> 08:26.897
and they feel...

08:26.941 --> 08:28.420
completely normal.

08:29.639 --> 08:32.207
So, not giant
cell arteritis.

08:32.250 --> 08:33.904
I'm not a doctor,
but could it be

08:33.948 --> 08:36.341
small cell arteritis?

08:38.605 --> 08:40.563
Yeah. Uh-huh.
Thanks, Gordon.

08:40.607 --> 08:41.956
Uh...

08:41.999 --> 08:43.958
Oh, what's this?

08:44.001 --> 08:45.829
Blue nail beds.

08:45.873 --> 08:48.136
It's COPD.

08:48.179 --> 08:49.616
Y-Yeah, actually,

08:49.659 --> 08:51.443
my pen broke.

08:51.487 --> 08:53.576
So, blue.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.099
And you're just
telling us this now?

08:55.143 --> 08:57.101
Gordon, when we asked if
there was anything else

08:57.145 --> 08:59.843
we should know, you didn't think
to mention that your pen broke?

09:00.888 --> 09:02.933
I didn't think it was relevant.

09:02.977 --> 09:04.152
Are you a doctor?No.

09:04.195 --> 09:05.675
That's right.

09:07.198 --> 09:08.722
We'll decide what's relevant.

09:10.375 --> 09:14.031
Listen, um, I'm sorry
if I said something back there.

09:14.075 --> 09:15.946
No, we're cool.
Really.

09:15.990 --> 09:17.861
I was just thinking
I would tap out for the day.

09:17.905 --> 09:19.080
Tap out?

09:19.123 --> 09:20.124
You mean go home?

09:20.168 --> 09:22.039
We can't do that.
We're doctors.

09:23.084 --> 09:25.521
Today was just really intense.

09:25.565 --> 09:26.522
It was.

09:26.566 --> 09:27.958
You want to talk about it?

09:28.002 --> 09:29.960
Oh. No.
[chuckles]

09:30.004 --> 09:32.441
The Gilanis are not
"talk it out" people.

09:32.484 --> 09:36.837
We prefer inappropriate jokes
and isolation.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.708
Fine. Don't talk to me.

09:38.752 --> 09:40.057
Although you should,

09:40.101 --> 09:41.624
because I am
universally lauded

09:41.668 --> 09:43.844
for giving
excellent advice.[sighs]

09:43.887 --> 09:45.019
But if you're
feeling stressed,

09:45.062 --> 09:46.890
you know,
there's things you can do.

09:46.934 --> 09:48.588
Right, like drink water,
get plenty of sleep

09:48.631 --> 09:50.067
and eat vegetables.

09:50.111 --> 09:51.373
Steal drugs
from the supply closet.

09:51.416 --> 09:52.766
[gasps]
Carol![chuckles]

09:52.809 --> 09:54.855
That's me being inappropriate.[chuckles]

09:54.898 --> 09:56.334
Nice one.[chuckles]

09:56.378 --> 09:57.858
Listen,

09:57.901 --> 10:00.121
remember when we were
at orientation?

10:00.164 --> 10:02.689
You made fun of me
for listening, but they told us

10:02.732 --> 10:04.081
about a Doctor
Wellness Center.

10:04.125 --> 10:07.128
I mean, they
probably have resources--

10:07.171 --> 10:08.782
somebody to talk to,

10:08.825 --> 10:11.959
a quiet place
to meditate, a massage chair.

10:12.002 --> 10:14.483
Plus, it's nice to see
how many other doctors

10:14.526 --> 10:16.398
are dealing
with the exact same thing.

10:16.441 --> 10:18.705
That sounds good.

10:18.748 --> 10:23.144
But so does sitting
in a room by myself.

10:23.187 --> 10:24.885
I'll bet they have snacks.

10:24.928 --> 10:26.582
What are the chances
you give this up?

10:26.626 --> 10:27.931
Zero.Fine.

10:27.975 --> 10:30.630
And trust me,
as soon as we walk in there,

10:30.673 --> 10:33.633
the feeling of wellness
will just wash right over you.

10:33.676 --> 10:36.287
Oh, yeah.

10:36.331 --> 10:38.333
Yeah, baby.

10:38.376 --> 10:40.117
I see what you mean, Carol.

10:40.161 --> 10:41.815
I feel better already.

10:41.858 --> 10:44.208
Now, where should
the healing begin?

10:44.252 --> 10:47.211
On this treadmill from 1982?

10:47.255 --> 10:49.344
Or in this box of trash?

10:49.387 --> 10:50.650
Oh, I know.

10:50.693 --> 10:52.434
By that pile of mouse feces.

10:53.827 --> 10:56.568
Okay, Lexie,
I-I'm disappointed, too.

10:56.612 --> 10:57.787
You know,
they really made this place

10:57.831 --> 10:59.441
sound much nicer at orientation.

10:59.484 --> 11:03.010
Clearly, I'm the only person
that's needed to come here

11:03.053 --> 11:05.360
in the past 10,000 years.

11:05.403 --> 11:08.668
Look, I-I'm sorry, Lexie.

11:08.711 --> 11:10.408
I'm just trying
to make you feel better.

11:10.452 --> 11:12.672
Well, I feel worse.

11:12.715 --> 11:14.717
Great idea, Carol.

11:14.761 --> 11:16.719
My first idea was hot chocolate.

11:16.763 --> 11:18.721
I'm gonna get you hot chocolate!

11:28.078 --> 11:29.427
Where's Lexie?

11:29.471 --> 11:31.038
Not here.

11:31.081 --> 11:33.344
But do you know who ishere

11:33.388 --> 11:37.174
and wuvshot chocowate?

11:38.262 --> 11:40.700
Hands off. Lexie earned this.

11:40.743 --> 11:42.484
[sighs]

11:44.312 --> 11:45.269
I can't say no to that face.

11:45.313 --> 11:46.662
You can have mine.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.620
Anyway, have you seen her?

11:48.664 --> 11:50.231
She's not responding
to my pages.

11:50.274 --> 11:52.450
Mm-mm.Dr. Kenney,

11:52.494 --> 11:54.496
the dog that was with
your patient in 416

11:54.539 --> 11:56.019
is missing. Where is it?

11:56.063 --> 11:57.847
So some shenanigans happen
in the hospital,

11:57.891 --> 11:59.719
and you assume
I have something to do with it?

11:59.762 --> 12:01.721
Uh, yes.

12:01.764 --> 12:04.071
That's fair.

12:04.114 --> 12:05.681
You and Dennis
need to find it.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.466
What? But it's cocoa time.

12:08.510 --> 12:10.381
Oh.

12:10.425 --> 12:12.383
The hot chocolates are
getting in the way?

12:12.427 --> 12:13.645
Here.

12:13.689 --> 12:15.647
I'll take them. Find the dog.

12:17.998 --> 12:19.434
EKG is normal.

12:19.477 --> 12:20.957
Regular intervals.

12:21.001 --> 12:22.785
There's something
we're not seeing.

12:22.829 --> 12:24.569
Hey, you guys
are blocking the TV.

12:24.613 --> 12:26.093
Do you mind
scooching a bit?

12:27.616 --> 12:29.574
Wait a second.

12:29.618 --> 12:31.794
You mentioned
that you'd been to the gym.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.187
Oh, yes!

12:33.230 --> 12:35.493
A gym is a cesspool of
viruses and staph infection.

12:35.537 --> 12:37.844
It's basically a toilet
with treadmills.

12:37.887 --> 12:41.412
Yeah, a-actually,
I-I kind of exaggerated.

12:41.456 --> 12:43.414
The gym is my garage.

12:43.458 --> 12:46.853
It's just a ThighMaster
and a bag of sand.

12:47.897 --> 12:50.073
Oh! Didn't you also mention

12:50.117 --> 12:51.640
you felt your symptoms
at the supermarket?

12:51.683 --> 12:53.076
Were you in the produce aisle?

12:53.120 --> 12:56.427
Those misters are basically
E. coli fountains.

12:56.471 --> 12:57.820
They are?

12:57.864 --> 12:59.779
Wow, I might have gotten some
in my mouth

12:59.822 --> 13:01.084
when I was shaking out
the romaine.

13:01.128 --> 13:02.390
Do you think it was the romaine?

13:02.433 --> 13:04.522
Hey, Gordon, pro tip:

13:04.566 --> 13:06.350
next time you walk into a
hospital, do us all a favor

13:06.394 --> 13:07.787
and announce that
you've eaten romaine.

13:09.614 --> 13:13.096
[groans] Yeah, but E. coli
generally presents as fever.

13:13.140 --> 13:16.143
15 minutes, gents.

13:19.146 --> 13:21.104
Wait, I got it.

13:21.148 --> 13:23.715
Gordon, have you
urinated blood today?

13:23.759 --> 13:25.326
Um, no.

13:25.369 --> 13:28.372
Gordon, why can't you
just urinate blood?

13:29.896 --> 13:31.419
Finnegan!

13:31.462 --> 13:32.942
Finnegan! Here, boy!

13:32.986 --> 13:34.944
Finnegan?

13:34.988 --> 13:36.859
[sighs]

13:36.903 --> 13:39.731
You know, I can't stop
thinking about Lexie.

13:39.775 --> 13:41.777
I hope she's okay.
I mean,

13:41.821 --> 13:43.779
I just wish
she would get back to me.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.477
It's like she
doesn't want to be found.

13:46.521 --> 13:49.002
Dennis, I got to go.

13:50.177 --> 13:53.049
So I guess it's just me
looking for the dog?

13:55.051 --> 13:57.053
Finnegan?

14:02.798 --> 14:04.408
Hey, Lexie.

14:05.453 --> 14:07.237
Everything okay?

14:07.281 --> 14:09.849
Yeah, I'm great.
Why do you ask?

14:09.892 --> 14:11.894
Oh, I don't know. Just...

14:11.938 --> 14:13.896
looks like you've stolen
a service dog,

14:13.940 --> 14:15.898
and you're hiding
in a basement room

14:15.942 --> 14:17.465
that smells
like an old diaper.

14:19.728 --> 14:21.251
You know what?

14:21.295 --> 14:23.297
I'm just gonna join you
down there.

14:24.341 --> 14:26.343
[exhales]

14:29.346 --> 14:31.348
[grunts]

14:32.349 --> 14:33.611
Huh.

14:33.655 --> 14:35.657
It's much wetter
than I expected.

14:38.486 --> 14:40.227
Time's almost up.

14:40.270 --> 14:41.663
Frost will be back any second.

14:41.706 --> 14:43.404
Are you an IV drug user?No.

14:43.447 --> 14:45.493
Have you eaten
blowfish recently?No.

14:45.536 --> 14:47.582
Are you allergic
to peanuts?The food or the comic?

14:47.625 --> 14:50.411
Gordon, thin ice.

14:50.454 --> 14:53.240
Actually,
I am allergic to peanuts.

14:53.283 --> 14:54.894
What does that mean?

14:54.937 --> 14:56.591
Nothing.

14:56.634 --> 14:59.811
And time.

14:59.855 --> 15:00.900
Do you have a diagnosis?

15:02.205 --> 15:04.512
Looks like neither of you
escaped this room.

15:04.555 --> 15:06.818
And, Gordon,
for you to escape the hospital,

15:06.862 --> 15:09.256
I'll need to confirm
mydiagnosis

15:09.299 --> 15:12.172
by performing
a cardiac catheterization.

15:12.215 --> 15:13.913
Okay. What is that?

15:13.956 --> 15:16.741
Well, we insert a thin,
hollow tube

15:16.785 --> 15:19.092
through a blood vessel
and pass it up to your heart.

15:19.135 --> 15:20.528
We go in through the groin.

15:20.571 --> 15:21.572
I made it all up!

15:21.616 --> 15:23.139
What?!

15:24.749 --> 15:27.361
I was trying to get out
of dinner with my in-laws.

15:27.404 --> 15:30.886
Dude, you let me
do a rectal exam.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.323
You haven't met my in-laws.

15:33.367 --> 15:34.455
Mm.

15:34.498 --> 15:38.111
You don't deserve Noodles.

15:38.154 --> 15:39.939
Wait, how'd you figure it out
so quickly?

15:39.982 --> 15:41.723
Well, first, I noticed

15:41.766 --> 15:43.943
that his wife's
emergency contact number

15:43.986 --> 15:45.422
had a Florida area code.

15:46.641 --> 15:48.773
Now, when in-laws visit
from Florida,

15:48.817 --> 15:50.950
they don't come for a day.

15:50.993 --> 15:52.473
It's been ten days.

15:52.516 --> 15:54.344
Mm-hmm.

15:54.388 --> 15:55.955
Why did you ask

15:55.998 --> 15:57.565
about the arches of his feet
and his ears?

15:57.608 --> 15:59.523
Well, there are no diseases
that cause pain

15:59.567 --> 16:01.308
in the feet and the ears.

16:01.351 --> 16:04.006
Outside of his in-law-itis,

16:04.050 --> 16:06.313
Gordon is what we call
a malingerer.

16:06.356 --> 16:07.923
So,

16:07.967 --> 16:09.664
you mean, he's trying to stay
in the hospital?

16:09.707 --> 16:11.318
Mm, it's more common
than you think.

16:11.361 --> 16:13.668
So, next time, before you run
a bunch of expensive tests,

16:13.711 --> 16:16.018
consider if the answer
is right in front of you.

16:16.062 --> 16:18.455
I'm sorry, but you understand.

16:18.499 --> 16:20.457
In-laws are stressful.
[chuckles]

16:20.501 --> 16:21.981
Can I stay the night?

16:23.069 --> 16:25.332
Gordon, for goodness sake,

16:25.375 --> 16:26.507
just say it's a work trip.

16:26.550 --> 16:29.510
Book a hotel room
like a normal man.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.952
I-I was gonna walk away
from our patient.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.954
That woman
could've lost her arm.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.042
But she didn't.

16:40.086 --> 16:41.304
[sighs]
Only 'cause you were there.

16:41.348 --> 16:43.915
This job is crazy pressure.

16:43.959 --> 16:45.526
Yeah, it's a big difference
from med school

16:45.569 --> 16:47.963
where you just practiced
on dummies you couldn't kill.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.922
Oh, I killed a dummy once.

16:50.966 --> 16:53.403
Put her on a radiator,
and its head melted off.

16:53.447 --> 16:55.449
See, that's why
I never would have guessed

16:55.492 --> 16:56.406
anything was bothering you.

16:56.450 --> 16:58.452
You're always
cracking jokes.

16:58.495 --> 17:00.497
That's just always how
I've dealt with things.

17:00.541 --> 17:01.890
It's easier to laugh.

17:01.933 --> 17:03.500
And honestly, feelings?

17:03.544 --> 17:04.719
Lame.

17:04.762 --> 17:06.460
Well, that's the thing
about getting old.

17:06.503 --> 17:09.245
You realize you have to deal
with your feelings.

17:09.289 --> 17:10.638
I thought the thing
about getting old

17:10.681 --> 17:12.466
was not liking your neck.

17:13.467 --> 17:16.035
That's a big one, too.Hmm.

17:16.078 --> 17:17.775
We were working
together today.

17:17.819 --> 17:20.213
How is this not
getting to you?Oh, it is.

17:20.256 --> 17:21.866
I guess I just have
more practice

17:21.910 --> 17:24.086
dealing with
intense situations.

17:24.130 --> 17:26.175
Like life or death?

17:26.219 --> 17:28.395
Have you ever been afraid of
accidentally killing someone?

17:28.438 --> 17:31.354
Have you ever brought an infant
home from the hospital?

17:32.399 --> 17:34.009
No.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.403
But I'll admit, when I walk
through the maternity ward,

17:36.446 --> 17:38.579
it is tempting.

17:38.622 --> 17:40.972
You know, maybe
I'm not thrown by this

17:41.016 --> 17:43.279
'cause I've already been
through so much in my life.

17:43.323 --> 17:45.673
Faced pressures,
experienced failures...

17:45.716 --> 17:48.458
Like your marriage.[sighs]

17:48.502 --> 17:49.851
That's fine.

17:49.894 --> 17:52.767
If that helps you get
through this, make your jokes.

17:52.810 --> 17:56.249
And I promise, I will be here,
and I will listen.

17:56.292 --> 17:58.425
I will also pretend
that they're funny.

17:59.426 --> 18:01.863
Wow. Solid burn, Carol.

18:01.906 --> 18:02.864
Mm-hmm.

18:02.907 --> 18:04.431
Thanks.

18:04.474 --> 18:07.042
And, you know, this place
is definitely not gonna help

18:07.086 --> 18:08.696
with any of this.

18:08.739 --> 18:10.872
But you know what will?

18:10.915 --> 18:13.353
Aw, I thought maybe
we could all use this.

18:13.396 --> 18:15.355
It's been a stressful day.DANIEL: Yeah.

18:15.398 --> 18:18.880
Today, Dr. Sommers and I
couldn't even diagnose nothing.

18:18.923 --> 18:20.882
I really need a hug.

18:20.925 --> 18:22.579
May I?

18:24.973 --> 18:26.931
These dogs are
way more effective

18:26.975 --> 18:29.151
than the Wellness
Center, aka the place

18:29.195 --> 18:31.153
where hope and
spiders go to die.

18:32.589 --> 18:35.201
We need better resources
than a haunted storage closet

18:35.244 --> 18:36.724
to deal with the stresses
of this job.

18:36.767 --> 18:37.725
FROST:
Agreed.

18:37.768 --> 18:38.900
When I was an intern,

18:38.943 --> 18:40.206
if you had any emotions,

18:40.249 --> 18:42.251
you were just supposed
to stuff them down

18:42.295 --> 18:44.079
until your heart exploded.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.516
I lost two of my best friends.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.388
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

18:48.431 --> 18:49.650
To investment banking.

18:51.521 --> 18:54.481
Wow, I really thought
I was the only one.

18:54.524 --> 18:55.612
You're not the only one.

18:55.656 --> 18:57.136
You're just the first
in your class.

18:57.179 --> 18:58.311
You'll all go through it.

18:58.354 --> 18:59.573
That's why it's important

18:59.616 --> 19:01.923
you rely on your fellow interns
for support.

19:01.966 --> 19:03.142
Very true.

19:03.185 --> 19:04.926
They understand
what you're going through

19:04.969 --> 19:06.319
better than anyone else.

19:06.362 --> 19:07.711
That's a great idea.

19:07.755 --> 19:09.844
You guys must be under
a lot of stress, too.

19:09.887 --> 19:13.195
Sure, you're here for us,
but who's here for you?

19:13.239 --> 19:14.544
I don't think
dogs get stressed.

19:14.588 --> 19:17.068
Clearly, someone has
never seen Scooby-Doo.

19:18.896 --> 19:22.378
Well, wecan
support each other.Deal.

19:22.422 --> 19:24.250
Ah! I found the dog.
[chuckles]

19:25.860 --> 19:28.558
He was in the alley
behind the dumpster.

19:28.602 --> 19:31.082
He fought me a little,
but, uh, I cornered him.

19:31.126 --> 19:33.346
[laughs]Dennis,

19:33.389 --> 19:34.390
that's not a service animal.

19:34.434 --> 19:36.218
I think you found a stray dog.

19:39.265 --> 19:42.137
I may need one of you
to give me a tetanus shot.

19:52.930 --> 19:55.890
Gordon, what are you
still doing here?

19:55.933 --> 19:57.761
Oh, I'm gonna be out
of your hair in two seconds.

19:57.805 --> 19:59.110
Just getting a quick snack.

20:00.155 --> 20:02.331
Wait, aren't you
allergic to peanuts?

20:02.375 --> 20:05.900
This ought to keep me here
through the weekend.

20:06.988 --> 20:09.469
No, no, no, no, no, no!No, no, no, no!
