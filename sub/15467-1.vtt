00:40.956 --> 00:43.729
He died for love.

00:43.834 --> 00:49.193
Born just after the Civil War,
Daniel Robitaille was the son of slaves,

00:49.297 --> 00:51.028
an artist by trade.

00:51.133 --> 00:55.616
A wealthy landowner commissioned him
to paint the portrait of his daughter.

00:55.720 --> 00:58.779
They fell in love. She became pregnant.

00:59.933 --> 01:03.620
Her father had his thugs chase
the poor man through the town.

01:04.563 --> 01:10.337
When they caught him, they sawed off
his right hand with a rusty blade.

01:11.027 --> 01:13.670
A nearby beehive was raided,

01:14.239 --> 01:18.341
and the honeycomb smeared
over his bleeding, mutilated body.

01:19.202 --> 01:23.933
The crowd that had gathered
fled as the bees came for him.

01:24.791 --> 01:27.565
He died for love.

01:27.919 --> 01:33.813
His resurrection began as rumor,
and grew into myth.

01:34.760 --> 01:38.451
Say his name five times
in the mirror and he would appear.

01:38.555 --> 01:41.746
A hook had replaced his severed hand.

01:41.850 --> 01:46.834
Sorrow and hate fill his eyes.
Bees buzz about his lips.

01:46.938 --> 01:49.837
The myth has traveled
from place to place,

01:49.941 --> 01:53.299
taking root in the most desperate areas.

01:53.403 --> 01:56.135
Even here, in New Orleans,

01:56.239 --> 02:00.014
murders have been committed in his name.

02:00.118 --> 02:03.389
Yes, but is he real?

02:04.790 --> 02:07.978
Cabrini Green, Chicago, 1992.

02:08.794 --> 02:12.235
Helen Lyle becomes
so obsessed by the myth

02:12.339 --> 02:15.238
that she takes on
the persona of Candyman,

02:15.342 --> 02:17.531
killing her victims with a hook.

02:17.636 --> 02:21.077
Cabrini residents believe
she was the Candyman.

02:21.181 --> 02:24.580
- What about you, Doctor Purcell?
- Do I believe in Candyman?

02:24.684 --> 02:27.458
I believe in the myth.

02:27.562 --> 02:31.254
But the fact? The flesh and blood? No.

02:31.358 --> 02:34.214
- I'm afraid not.
- Prove it.

02:39.282 --> 02:41.463
Candyman,

02:41.618 --> 02:43.549
Candyman,

02:44.162 --> 02:46.389
Candyman,

02:46.748 --> 02:48.928
Candyman,

02:52.754 --> 02:54.483
Candyman.

02:59.010 --> 03:01.950
Well, that is a relief.

03:02.681 --> 03:06.872
My publisher would never have
forgiven me. Imagine the headlines:

03:06.977 --> 03:11.826
"Cambridge Scholar Eviscerated
with Hook on Book Tour."

03:23.076 --> 03:26.632
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like you
to meet our Candyman, Peter.

04:05.160 --> 04:09.344
Oh, I'm sorry. These streets
have got me all turned around.

04:13.418 --> 04:16.012
We were a little shy back there, were we?

04:16.755 --> 04:19.564
- It's a gift?
- "To Ethan".

04:22.010 --> 04:24.487
Ethan Tarrant.

04:28.809 --> 04:31.666
Ethan, I'm sorry about
what happened to your father.

04:31.770 --> 04:34.919
- He came to you for help.
- Have you any idea

04:35.023 --> 04:39.090
- how many people contact me?
- My father wasn't a crackpot.

04:39.194 --> 04:42.051
I'm not saying he was.

04:42.155 --> 04:44.053
You told him there was no Candyman.

04:44.157 --> 04:46.514
You told him to say the name...
and now he's dead.

04:46.618 --> 04:51.102
Look, Ethan, I've seen this happen before.
People get sucked into the myth.

04:51.206 --> 04:54.230
There's no myth.
Daniel Robitaille was real.

04:54.334 --> 04:58.187
Daniel Robitaille has been dead
and buried for a very long time.

04:58.463 --> 05:00.607
He's here.

05:01.299 --> 05:03.614
You called him.

05:03.718 --> 05:06.658
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

05:13.145 --> 05:15.704
You're next, Purcell.

05:16.398 --> 05:20.998
- Groin to gullet.
- You're as crazy as your father was.

05:28.869 --> 05:31.012
Give me a shot of single malt.

05:38.670 --> 05:41.527
Fucking murderer!

05:41.631 --> 05:43.775
Hey!

05:49.765 --> 05:52.788
Get him the fuck outta here!

05:52.893 --> 05:54.990
You're next, Purcell.

05:55.896 --> 05:58.039
Get out!

06:47.614 --> 06:50.174
It's... my book.

08:31.968 --> 08:37.861
WBOV.

08:40.769 --> 08:42.917
Are you with me, New Orleans?

08:43.020 --> 08:48.368
Do ya hear me? This is the Kingfish
coming to you at 96.2 FM.

08:48.819 --> 08:52.176
Anointed and appointed.

08:52.280 --> 08:54.470
Just three more days, Crescent City,

08:54.574 --> 08:56.847
three days until Lent.

08:56.952 --> 08:59.976
So let's have it, the merriment
before the penance,

09:00.080 --> 09:02.853
and the feast before the fast.

09:02.958 --> 09:07.523
The Kingfish gonna keep
y'all company all the way down.

09:11.800 --> 09:15.992
Hey, brothers and sisters, y'all know
what "carnival" means in Latin?

09:16.096 --> 09:21.372
Well, the Kingfish went to the good
schools, so he can tell you all about it.

09:21.476 --> 09:25.001
"Carnival: farewell to the flesh."

09:25.105 --> 09:30.423
That's what it means.
I like that a lot. "Farewell to the flesh."

09:30.527 --> 09:33.087
Yeah, you right.

09:41.705 --> 09:46.063
And farewell to all that floodin',
as far as I'm concerned.

09:46.168 --> 09:47.982
That's right. Look at it.

09:48.086 --> 09:52.445
The banks of the mighty Mississippi
are ready to spill their seed.

09:52.549 --> 09:55.239
Just look at that sky out there.

09:55.343 --> 09:57.909
It's ready to rain on us again.

09:58.013 --> 10:00.745
And the clouds?
Well, now, brothers and sisters,

10:00.849 --> 10:04.123
they're not the only thing
threatenin' the Crescent City.

10:04.227 --> 10:06.959
We're talking murder, mes amis.

10:07.063 --> 10:11.672
Cos so we've heard before,
the hook man, kerchunk.

10:11.777 --> 10:15.760
So when you pull on your costume
and turn to admire yourself in the mirror,

10:15.864 --> 10:19.263
please keep those lips locked tight.

10:19.367 --> 10:22.177
Do not call his name.

10:34.633 --> 10:36.781
Is he always so angry?

10:36.885 --> 10:39.158
Guess so.

10:39.262 --> 10:42.578
- And why do you think that is?
- Cos he's been hurt.

10:42.682 --> 10:45.907
"Cos he's been hurt"!

10:48.980 --> 10:51.492
Who hurt him, Matthew?

10:53.026 --> 10:56.665
- Everyone.
- Hey, Annie. Look.

10:59.157 --> 11:00.293
Come here.

11:08.417 --> 11:12.942
- If you stay there, I can paint you too.
- Ever tried using paper, Liz?

11:13.046 --> 11:15.403
No way. I hate paper.
There's nothing on it.

11:15.507 --> 11:19.824
But that's why it needs you to fill it up.
Besides, you can't keep a mirror, darlin'.

11:19.928 --> 11:22.155
Why not? It's not going anywhere.

11:25.308 --> 11:28.749
- It's your brother.
- It's only a couple of days till Mardi Gras.

11:28.854 --> 11:32.169
- I said I'd get them plaster of Paris.
- I know, for their mask.

11:32.274 --> 11:36.966
Annie, if there's one thing these kids
understand, it's taking care of themselves.

11:37.070 --> 11:39.630
- I'll be back in the morning.
- Just go.

11:49.082 --> 11:51.226
Hey, Pam.

11:53.295 --> 11:55.693
You movin' in here, or what?

11:55.797 --> 11:57.100
No.

11:58.091 --> 11:59.820
No, let's go.

12:17.778 --> 12:20.337
- Howdy, Miss Tarrant.
- Hi, Greg.

12:33.710 --> 12:37.401
- Aren't you ready yet?
- Oh! Lord, I hate that thing.

12:37.506 --> 12:41.447
- Then why leave it on all the time?
- Annie, please. Don't start with me.

12:41.551 --> 12:46.911
- Mother, what did Ethan say?
- Well, he barely even spoke to me.

12:47.015 --> 12:49.997
He only wants to see you. Oh, Annie.

12:50.102 --> 12:52.697
I mean, murder.

12:59.736 --> 13:03.719
- Hello, Mrs. Tarrant.
- Is that what you call a speedy response?

13:03.824 --> 13:07.890
- Pardon me, ma'am?
- I set that alarm off 45 seconds ago.

13:07.994 --> 13:11.686
Ma'am, we try to respond as fast
as we can. But we do need a codeword.

13:11.790 --> 13:14.939
Codeword? Oh, I'll give you a codeword.

13:15.043 --> 13:17.900
- "Dickhead".
- Mother.

13:18.004 --> 13:22.697
When you reach my age, Annie,
you can say whatever the hell you want.

13:22.801 --> 13:25.866
Does Dr. Lewis let you drink?

13:25.971 --> 13:28.995
Dr. Lewis thinks I'm dyin' of cancer.

13:29.099 --> 13:31.955
Says it doesn't
make a difference what I do.

13:37.107 --> 13:39.619
We'll get that taken in.

13:40.736 --> 13:42.879
You know the only thing I regret?

13:44.531 --> 13:47.506
I never had a chance to grow out the grey.

13:50.829 --> 13:53.555
I can tell you the exact day I got ill.

13:55.125 --> 13:57.352
It was the day your father died.

14:14.770 --> 14:18.127
- Stay back. Stand back.
- Can you comment on your son's arrest?

14:18.231 --> 14:20.162
Just stay back!

14:20.358 --> 14:22.954
Paul! Paul, just help my mother!

14:25.947 --> 14:27.961
- Excuse me!
- Give us a comment!

14:33.080 --> 14:37.846
Here you go, Octavia.
A cup of java with all the fixings.

14:48.720 --> 14:51.991
It's the chicory in it.
It helps settle my stomach.

14:53.642 --> 14:56.035
You are a life-saver, Paul.

14:56.728 --> 14:59.335
He'll make a great father someday.

14:59.439 --> 15:02.630
Course, I'll be food for the worms by then.

15:02.734 --> 15:06.926
I'd like a winter funeral...
especially with this climate.

15:07.030 --> 15:09.887
Mrs. Tarrant? Ma'am.

15:09.991 --> 15:14.558
- Maybe I should see him alone first.
- Yes, maybe that'd be best.

15:14.663 --> 15:17.520
I wouldn't want to upset him.

15:17.624 --> 15:22.686
We'll go to the cafeteria.
I hear the gumbo is good and hot.

15:33.265 --> 15:36.655
Hey! My guardian angel.

15:37.936 --> 15:40.827
- How are you?
- I've been better.

15:42.941 --> 15:45.089
How's Mom?

15:45.193 --> 15:47.623
She's coping.

15:48.989 --> 15:53.470
- Do you want me to call the dean?
- There's... there's no need.

15:54.870 --> 15:57.977
- He kicked me out three months ago.
- What?

15:58.081 --> 16:02.982
Come on, Annie. Law school
was Dad's dream, not mine.

16:03.086 --> 16:07.734
- I hated the classes, the teachers...
- The bar-hopping in the Quarter.

16:09.009 --> 16:11.438
Just tell me what happened last night.

16:12.471 --> 16:15.912
This asshole sat down
and he ordered a drink.

16:16.016 --> 16:18.247
He started chewin' on his ice...

16:18.351 --> 16:21.751
You're full of shit, Ethan, and you know it!

16:21.855 --> 16:24.331
What happened?

16:30.530 --> 16:34.013
- You're not supposed to be in here.
- The guy's a fuckin' freak.

16:34.117 --> 16:37.516
- Too much inbreeding, if you ask me.
- Rules, Ray.

16:37.621 --> 16:41.187
Think I'll let some country-club
pissant slip through our fingers?

16:41.291 --> 16:43.554
The boy is getting sloppy.

16:43.794 --> 16:47.148
The first three victims were John Does.

16:49.007 --> 16:52.943
Until number four: Mr. Coleman Tarrant.

16:53.261 --> 16:57.066
- Murdered like all the rest.
- And guess who found Daddy's body?

16:58.058 --> 17:01.165
None other than young Ethan.

17:01.269 --> 17:05.323
What is going on?
Are you protecting someone?

17:07.401 --> 17:10.126
Am I protecting someone?

17:10.862 --> 17:14.387
- I'll call Clay McPherson and...
- No, no, no.

17:14.491 --> 17:17.596
- No lawyers.
- Family has some friends.

17:18.578 --> 17:21.060
Can't help him now.

17:21.164 --> 17:23.641
I knew kids like him in school.

17:25.585 --> 17:28.061
Always thought they were better than me,

17:29.047 --> 17:33.364
cos they lived in some fucking mansion
up on Esplanade Avenue.

17:33.468 --> 17:37.243
You can't charm your way out of this one.
We're talking about murder.

17:37.347 --> 17:42.826
Don't you get it, Annie? I did it.
I confessed. End of story.

17:45.313 --> 17:50.131
Looks like I'm gonna be enjoyin'
Mardi Gras with my husband after all.

17:50.235 --> 17:52.546
I know what this is about.

17:53.029 --> 17:58.970
- Really?
- Sometimes people wanna be punished,

17:59.953 --> 18:02.180
even when they've done nothing wrong.

18:06.585 --> 18:08.646
You didn't kill Dad, Ethan.

18:12.758 --> 18:16.032
You were just in the house that night.

18:16.136 --> 18:18.826
- This has nothing to do with Dad.
- I think it does.

18:18.930 --> 18:22.371
- Well, drop it anyway.
- What did you see?

18:22.476 --> 18:24.123
- Leave it alone.
- Ethan!

18:24.227 --> 18:26.876
I said, leave it alone!

18:26.980 --> 18:29.587
- Damn!
- Time's up.

18:29.691 --> 18:32.880
- I'm gonna find out what happened.
- No! No!

18:40.410 --> 18:44.018
I'm sorry, Miss Tarrant,
but this is an open-and-shut case.

18:44.122 --> 18:48.481
- He hasn't even hired an attorney yet.
- Your brother made a full confession.

18:48.585 --> 18:52.109
What kind of evidence do you have?
There's no weapon, no blood on him.

18:52.214 --> 18:56.030
- People heard him threaten the victim.
- That doesn't mean he killed him.

18:56.134 --> 18:59.408
Look, we're talking about more
than Dr. Purcell's murder here.

18:59.513 --> 19:00.910
What are you saying?

19:01.014 --> 19:05.827
It's possible that Ethan was involved
in your father's death as well.

19:08.063 --> 19:10.753
They were killed in exactly the same way.

19:10.857 --> 19:14.580
This is insane.
My brother worshipped our father.

19:14.945 --> 19:20.471
You have no idea what he's been through.
Find yourself another scapegoat.

19:20.575 --> 19:23.467
My brother didn't do this.

19:27.290 --> 19:29.186
We'll see.

19:30.001 --> 19:33.859
This is going out to the man
with the hook. Hey, man, chill.

19:33.964 --> 19:36.612
Relax. Have some gumbo or somethin'.

19:36.716 --> 19:39.615
Even the Kingfish know
when to draw the line.

19:39.719 --> 19:42.201
Going somewhere, Ben?

19:42.305 --> 19:48.165
- Oh, yeah. I got to do the do.
- Oh, oh. He's got to do the do.

19:48.270 --> 19:50.960
Hey, what's the matter?
You don't like my cooking?

19:51.064 --> 19:53.129
- That too hot for you?
- I'm not hungry.

19:53.233 --> 19:55.579
You're a lightweight.

19:56.570 --> 19:58.916
Do you think a family can be cursed?

20:01.992 --> 20:06.758
When we were growing up, we thought
we were the luckiest kids in the world.

20:07.247 --> 20:09.812
Ethan was so smart.

20:09.916 --> 20:14.481
Daddy thought he'd be the first
Tarrant in the Supreme Court.

20:15.630 --> 20:18.571
But when he died,

20:18.675 --> 20:22.148
there was this... cloud.

20:23.597 --> 20:26.078
Annie. Annie!

20:26.183 --> 20:30.207
You gotta start thinkin'
of the good things in life.

20:30.312 --> 20:34.128
You got a whole classroom full of kids
who give a damn because of you.

20:34.232 --> 20:37.590
Plus, you got a stud-muffin for a husband.

20:37.694 --> 20:39.838
At least, your mama thinks so.

20:45.285 --> 20:49.138
- Whaddaya say we get outta here?
- Thought you'd never ask.

21:16.316 --> 21:19.374
Hey! Get the hell outta here!

21:23.740 --> 21:26.086
Goddamn tourist.

21:35.085 --> 21:37.229
Gotta do the do.

22:43.737 --> 22:47.506
- Jesus!
- I'm sorry. I thought you heard me.

22:50.577 --> 22:53.007
It's lookin' good.

22:53.997 --> 22:56.557
I just can't seem to finish it.

23:03.131 --> 23:05.524
The happy family.

23:05.967 --> 23:08.360
We'll do better. I promise.

23:11.848 --> 23:14.574
Daddy loved this house.

23:15.268 --> 23:18.742
Even after we moved out,
he'd always drive us past it.

23:20.148 --> 23:22.708
It was as if he was drawn to it.

23:24.861 --> 23:29.011
Are you with me, Crescent City?
Do you feel it comin' on?

23:29.116 --> 23:33.140
When the Catholic Church realized
they couldn't rid us of our pagan ways,

23:33.245 --> 23:35.083
they invited...

23:52.681 --> 23:55.454
- What's that for?
- Just in case.

24:05.133 --> 24:07.042
That's a good idea, honey.

24:33.221 --> 24:34.950
Jesus.

24:53.325 --> 24:56.265
This explains a lot.

24:56.369 --> 24:59.344
Paul, I haven't lived here for 13 years.

25:38.036 --> 25:39.765
Annie!

25:41.415 --> 25:43.462
I don't think we're alone.

26:09.693 --> 26:11.757
You scared the hell out of me.

26:11.862 --> 26:14.172
Keep your fucking hands off my things.

26:14.573 --> 26:17.880
Sorry. I didn't mean to get in your way.

26:18.160 --> 26:20.474
Goddamn fool.

26:20.579 --> 26:23.644
- Just like the others.
- Paul.

26:23.749 --> 26:26.854
Annie, I was just explaining to Mr...

26:30.630 --> 26:35.195
Look, we don't want to bother anyone.
We were just looking around.

26:35.761 --> 26:38.782
You see, I used to live here.

26:40.724 --> 26:43.200
I'm with her.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.920
And I thought I'd met all your relatives.

26:49.024 --> 26:52.798
No, no, no! Annie,
what are we looking for here?

26:52.903 --> 26:56.218
- Something happened to Ethan that night.
- He found your father.

26:56.323 --> 26:59.428
But it's more than that. Follow me.

27:04.081 --> 27:08.017
This... was my bedroom.

27:08.668 --> 27:11.524
Oh, this is nice.

27:12.089 --> 27:14.528
See?

27:14.633 --> 27:16.943
You got the room with the view.

27:23.642 --> 27:28.538
Those were the old slave quarters. Ethan
and I were never allowed to play there.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.802
It happened in there.

27:50.127 --> 27:53.526
- My God, are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

27:53.630 --> 27:57.269
- Let's just get outta here, Annie.
- I'll be right back.

29:55.669 --> 29:58.525
Hey! What are you doing?

30:01.258 --> 30:03.189
Goddammit.

30:08.223 --> 30:10.119
Hey, come on, guys.

30:17.065 --> 30:18.877
Come on.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.920
Would you relax?

30:23.822 --> 30:26.049
Let's go.

30:39.713 --> 30:42.688
Annie, I really wish you'd take the day off.

30:43.133 --> 30:47.864
Right now, those kids are
the only thing that's keeping me sane.

30:54.978 --> 30:57.668
- I love you.
- I love you too.

30:57.773 --> 31:00.913
- I'll see you later.
- OK.

31:08.617 --> 31:11.641
Guys, what's going on here?
Cut this out and stop fighting.

31:11.745 --> 31:13.935
Boys... Liz, what's his name?

31:14.039 --> 31:16.437
Stop this! Why are you doing this?

31:16.541 --> 31:19.231
Drew, Matt, stop it!

31:19.336 --> 31:22.151
- We were making masks...
- I'll take over from here.

31:22.255 --> 31:25.571
Wait a second. Stop it.
What is the problem?

31:25.675 --> 31:29.116
Matthew! Drew! Now stop it!

31:29.221 --> 31:32.245
- What is going on?
- He started it.

31:32.349 --> 31:34.330
- Liar.
- He did. Look.

31:34.434 --> 31:36.412
Matthew?

31:38.355 --> 31:40.582
What is it?

31:54.121 --> 31:56.977
It's the Candyman. They killed him.

32:04.631 --> 32:08.364
Listen, guys. There's
no such thing as a Candyman.

32:08.468 --> 32:13.995
It's just a story, a really scary story. And
these come from Matthew's imagination.

32:14.099 --> 32:16.622
- But what about all the murders?
- Well...

32:16.726 --> 32:21.419
Sometimes there are people in this world
that do bad things. Horrible things.

32:21.523 --> 32:25.881
When they don't get caught, we blame
imaginary monsters for their crimes.

32:25.986 --> 32:29.802
But that's all the Candyman is.
An imaginary monster.

32:29.906 --> 32:34.640
But he lives in the mirror.
That's how he gets ya, from the mirror.

32:34.745 --> 32:39.145
Five times. If you say his name
five times, he's supposed to come.

32:39.249 --> 32:41.761
You guys don't really
believe that, do you?

32:50.886 --> 32:54.193
Well, I guess I'm just
gonna have to prove it, then.

32:59.770 --> 33:01.913
Here goes.

33:09.613 --> 33:12.089
Candyman.

33:14.284 --> 33:16.428
Candyman.

33:18.538 --> 33:20.682
Candyman.

33:25.212 --> 33:27.143
Candyman.

33:35.597 --> 33:37.990
Candyman.

33:44.689 --> 33:47.082
You see? Nothing happened.

34:33.280 --> 34:36.551
I can't believe you actually did that.

34:37.451 --> 34:40.308
It was the only way
I could convince them.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.675
And maybe yourself?

34:44.833 --> 34:47.607
- What does that mean?
- I think you know.

34:55.302 --> 34:57.031
What?

35:55.278 --> 35:57.927
Are you ready for dessert?

35:58.031 --> 36:00.045
Again?

36:01.034 --> 36:02.633
Come on.

36:11.878 --> 36:14.224
There are no monsters.

36:33.900 --> 36:35.000
Shit!

36:36.653 --> 36:38.968
Do you need any help out there?

36:39.072 --> 36:41.750
No, no, everything is fine, Annie.

36:46.413 --> 36:48.177
Paul?

36:57.716 --> 37:00.393
Annie.

37:00.635 --> 37:02.317
Annie.

37:09.811 --> 37:12.122
I am the writing on the wall,

37:13.315 --> 37:15.542
the whisper in the classroom.

37:45.639 --> 37:47.652
Annie,

37:48.058 --> 37:50.653
I came for you.

37:55.732 --> 37:57.876
Ready or not...

38:01.696 --> 38:03.259
Paul...

38:03.573 --> 38:05.717
We have a journey to make,

38:07.202 --> 38:09.714
you and I.

38:15.210 --> 38:19.727
McKeever negotiates the steps,
saves the dessert. What a guy!

39:34.498 --> 39:37.935
Annie, be with me.

39:40.629 --> 39:42.975
You're mine.

39:52.599 --> 39:55.122
Mardi Gras... every night's
like a full moon.

39:55.227 --> 39:59.835
If you ask me, that family won
the jackpot in the shit sweepstakes.

39:59.940 --> 40:02.505
Give it a rest, Ray.

40:02.609 --> 40:05.833
Take your time.
Anything you can remember.

40:06.905 --> 40:08.886
It was him.

40:08.990 --> 40:11.264
Him? Who is "him"?

40:11.368 --> 40:13.880
He just came out of the shadows.

40:14.162 --> 40:17.770
He had this hook
that came out of his arm,

40:17.874 --> 40:21.348
and bees were crawling out of his face.

40:21.711 --> 40:26.279
Miss Tarrant, it is Mardi Gras. Now, if you
saw some kind of freak in a costume...

40:26.383 --> 40:29.031
It wasn't a mask.

40:29.136 --> 40:32.775
- He's real.
- Of course.

40:35.350 --> 40:37.873
What about my brother?

40:37.978 --> 40:40.543
There's no reason to think
your husband's murder...

40:40.647 --> 40:43.838
That's bullshit and you know it.
He's innocent.

40:43.942 --> 40:45.706
Well, if he is,

40:46.319 --> 40:48.997
then that just leaves you, doesn't it?

40:49.906 --> 40:52.430
Oh, Annie. Annie.

40:52.534 --> 40:55.182
Oh, Mom. Oh, Mom.

40:55.287 --> 40:57.393
Oh, thank heavens...

40:57.497 --> 40:59.428
She's lyin'.

40:59.833 --> 41:01.266
I'm here, honey.

41:06.214 --> 41:08.644
We're almost home, honey.

41:39.372 --> 41:41.516
Here.

41:43.919 --> 41:47.973
- Do you think I'm crazy, too?
- Annie, don't talk like that.

41:49.716 --> 41:52.240
Why did Daddy
go to the house that night?

41:52.344 --> 41:56.535
- What did he know?
- Annie, please. You should rest.

41:56.640 --> 42:00.789
Did he ever talk about him?
Did he ever mention the Candyman?

42:01.103 --> 42:03.876
Just go to sleep. That's what you need.

42:05.357 --> 42:07.703
That's what we all need.

43:21.224 --> 43:25.291
Today is the day, New Orleans.
It's Mardi Gras.

43:25.395 --> 43:29.754
And time is already runnin' out.
When the clock strikes midnight,

43:29.858 --> 43:32.256
when good ol' Comus greets Rex,

43:32.360 --> 43:36.427
when the police on their horses
come to sweep us out of the Quarter,

43:36.531 --> 43:40.170
it, mes amis, is histoire.

44:00.555 --> 44:03.412
- Annie.
- No.

44:03.517 --> 44:05.993
You brought me here.

44:06.645 --> 44:08.243
You killed Paul.

44:08.647 --> 44:13.164
Swallow your horror,
and let it nourish you.

44:15.153 --> 44:20.216
Come with me,
and sing the song of misery.

44:21.368 --> 44:25.601
Share my world,

44:25.705 --> 44:27.683
Annie.

44:45.767 --> 44:46.820
No!

44:50.564 --> 44:55.506
Annie! It's all right. It's all right.
You were just dreamin'.

44:55.610 --> 45:00.678
- Mother, I saw him.
- Annie, death is a return, you know.

45:00.782 --> 45:03.694
We leave life just like we came in.

45:04.286 --> 45:05.248
Alone?

45:05.349 --> 45:08.297
Naked, blind,
and covered in our own shit.

45:11.460 --> 45:14.767
Oh, no, but not me.
I'm goin' in my prom dress.

45:15.756 --> 45:18.185
The Lord knows it fits again.

45:23.054 --> 45:26.029
You rest. I'll get that.

45:33.857 --> 45:36.380
I don't care what they say.

45:36.485 --> 45:40.635
Tell them she's ill. Tell them they
should be in school, for God's sake.

45:40.739 --> 45:43.054
Who is it?

45:43.158 --> 45:46.714
It's no one, Annie. Why don't you
just go back up to bed?

45:52.042 --> 45:54.815
Send them up.

45:55.712 --> 45:57.441
Here?

46:03.345 --> 46:06.410
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Wait a second.

46:06.515 --> 46:09.573
Now, tell me exactly what happened.

46:10.393 --> 46:14.502
- All we know is that Matthew's gone.
- He disappeared last night.

46:14.606 --> 46:19.953
- The cops have been talkin' to everyone.
- They don't know a thing, but, what if?

46:30.664 --> 46:33.229
Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

46:33.333 --> 46:36.107
Now you makin' me proud, New Orleans.

46:36.211 --> 46:38.276
We are eatin' the meat raw.

46:38.380 --> 46:41.687
I tell ya what. I'm not
goin' home till this is over.

46:42.259 --> 46:45.074
I'm on the air full time.

46:45.178 --> 46:47.285
Man, somebody bring me a hurricane.

46:47.389 --> 46:51.247
Somebody find this Kingfish a woman.

46:51.351 --> 46:56.912
Lent starts tomorrow, mes amis,
and me, I want somethin' tasty to give up.

47:19.004 --> 47:21.736
- Who you lookin' for?
- I'm Matthew's teacher.

47:21.840 --> 47:25.239
- I'm lookin' for his father.
- The Reverend's not seeing anyone.

47:25.343 --> 47:28.117
- Please. I wanna help.
- Help?

47:28.221 --> 47:30.661
We've had way too much of that already.

47:30.766 --> 47:33.789
- Go on back to your classroom.
- You don't understand...

47:33.894 --> 47:37.367
- We understand, all right.
- Understand what?

47:39.775 --> 47:44.008
I always worried about him
being on the street after dark, but...

47:44.112 --> 47:48.679
he didn't want his daddy taggin' along
when he went to buy his paints, so...

47:48.784 --> 47:52.767
- like a fool, I let him go alone.
- What did the police say?

47:52.871 --> 47:54.435
The police don't give a damn.

47:54.539 --> 47:59.649
They figure, one less drug dealer
or potential murderer to worry about.

47:59.753 --> 48:04.104
- But they don't know my son.
- Matthew has seemed withdrawn, lately.

48:05.092 --> 48:08.783
Ever since his mother died,
he's been having nightmares.

48:08.887 --> 48:13.829
- Has he talked about them?
- No, but they must have been pretty bad.

48:13.934 --> 48:18.751
He doesn't sleep in his room any more.
He just sits up all night, painting.

48:18.855 --> 48:23.752
- It's the only thing that calms him.
- Can I see them? The paintings.

48:27.364 --> 48:29.793
He calls this his studio.

48:37.582 --> 48:39.893
Oh, Lord.

48:58.478 --> 49:01.961
Did he ever mention the Candyman?

49:02.065 --> 49:06.507
All the kids have heard of the stories.
But I never thought he'd believe them.

49:06.611 --> 49:09.218
But how did it happen to Matthew?

49:09.322 --> 49:11.262
I see it every day.

49:11.366 --> 49:15.349
The people around here are desperate.
They have no reason for hope.

49:15.454 --> 49:19.270
Some of 'em get sucked into the pit.
They turn to false gods.

49:19.374 --> 49:22.396
I am not gonna let that happen to my son.

49:33.889 --> 49:36.078
But what if it's true?

49:36.183 --> 49:38.289
What if the Candyman does exist?

49:38.393 --> 49:40.739
Then only God can save us.

49:45.400 --> 49:47.506
Come on, guys, let's go home.

49:47.611 --> 49:50.343
No, I'm gettin' this up.

49:50.447 --> 49:54.764
- Come on. Come on, guys.
- I'm tryin' to do this.

49:54.868 --> 49:57.463
- Come on, now, leave me alone.
- Push it.

49:59.831 --> 50:02.177
Damn. What do you want me to do?

50:05.420 --> 50:07.731
Bees got him.

50:08.799 --> 50:10.988
You will all be punished.

50:16.932 --> 50:19.574
Even you.

50:21.686 --> 50:24.585
That's right, New Orleans,
it's Mardi Gras.

50:24.689 --> 50:29.048
It's Fat Tuesday, and I am fat.

50:29.152 --> 50:31.592
My belt is broken, my pants are open,

50:31.696 --> 50:35.388
my belly is a mountain of love
stuffed with oysters.

50:35.492 --> 50:38.799
And y'all know what tomorrow is.
Ash Wednesday.

50:39.121 --> 50:42.261
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

50:42.916 --> 50:45.511
I just stood there and watched Paul die.

50:46.920 --> 50:48.981
And now Matthew.

50:53.635 --> 50:56.576
I said his name to those kids, Ethan.

50:56.680 --> 50:58.786
Oh, Jesus.

50:58.890 --> 51:02.114
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I wanted to protect you.

51:02.853 --> 51:05.033
You and Mom.

51:05.730 --> 51:08.077
But it wasn't enough.

51:09.735 --> 51:13.676
- It'll never be enough.
- What did you see that night?

51:13.780 --> 51:16.422
What was Daddy doing there?

51:17.409 --> 51:21.381
He believed, Annie.
He even convinced me.

51:21.747 --> 51:24.520
You weren't around to see
how obsessed he became.

51:24.624 --> 51:28.726
I mean, all Dad ever talked
about was callin' the...

51:30.672 --> 51:34.608
Callin' him. It got so bad,
I was afraid to leave him alone.

51:34.885 --> 51:37.527
But, that night, he got away from me.

51:38.472 --> 51:40.818
I knew exactly where he'd go.

51:44.770 --> 51:47.209
He'd been goin' to the house every night.

52:19.679 --> 52:22.026
I blew it, Annie.

52:23.475 --> 52:29.293
- If I'd gotten there five minutes sooner...
- But why? Why did he call him?

52:29.397 --> 52:31.504
Dad said he'd found a way to destroy him.

52:31.608 --> 52:36.300
- What has our family got to do with this?
- I don't know.

52:36.405 --> 52:38.344
Dad wouldn't tell me.

52:38.448 --> 52:42.974
Before he died, he got in touch with this
guy who trafficked in black market stuff.

52:43.078 --> 52:45.851
- Stolen art, weird shit.
- What was his name?

52:45.956 --> 52:49.974
- He won't talk to ya. I tried.
- His name.

52:53.422 --> 52:55.684
Thibideaux. He's in the Quarter.

52:56.341 --> 52:58.614
No, don't go. It's too dangerous.

52:58.718 --> 53:02.076
- I must find out what Dad was looking for.
- Wait till I get out.

53:02.180 --> 53:04.361
There isn't time.

53:05.350 --> 53:07.862
Besides, you'll be safe here.

53:08.437 --> 53:11.328
There's always someone watching.

53:38.133 --> 53:41.657
- I think you've done this before.
- Oh, yeah.

53:41.762 --> 53:45.614
- Come on, get it where it's drippin' there.
- I'm gonna try.

53:53.273 --> 53:56.212
Would you care for something sweet?

53:57.652 --> 54:00.718
A small snowball, please.

54:00.822 --> 54:02.966
Cherry?

54:03.950 --> 54:06.628
Cherry would be fine.

54:23.595 --> 54:26.784
Sweets for the sweet.

54:35.065 --> 54:37.209
Would you like something else?

54:37.567 --> 54:40.459
I'm looking for a man named Thibideaux.

54:41.446 --> 54:45.963
Well, I don't think I'm acquainted
with anybody by that name.

54:47.744 --> 54:52.436
- It's about my father.
- Maybe you should talk to your daddy.

54:52.541 --> 54:55.729
He's dead.

54:56.837 --> 54:59.610
He was murdered.

54:59.714 --> 55:02.440
Coleman Tarrant.

55:05.095 --> 55:06.742
Clara,

55:06.847 --> 55:11.706
why don't you run on ahead to that party
and I'll meet you over there, OK?

55:11.810 --> 55:17.668
I'll have you know, Honoré, I intend
to collect on that drink you promised me.

55:18.233 --> 55:20.911
Oh, yeah, baby. I'm countin' on it.

56:04.696 --> 56:07.256
Hello.

56:28.053 --> 56:30.451
You wait here.

56:30.555 --> 56:33.032
I'm gonna take a look.

56:41.191 --> 56:45.925
Your father understood the difference
between history and age.

56:46.029 --> 56:49.011
Some pieces are merely old.

56:49.116 --> 56:51.011
Others have history.

56:51.368 --> 56:55.643
And history, because it reflects life,
is not always pretty.

56:55.747 --> 57:01.094
It eats, it... if you'll pardon
the expression... shits.

57:03.839 --> 57:07.110
Most of the objects your father sought

57:08.009 --> 57:11.364
held history within them.

57:13.974 --> 57:18.916
Your father found out that the Candyman
was born here in New Orleans.

57:19.020 --> 57:21.367
His name was Daniel Robitaille.

57:22.858 --> 57:25.047
And she was his lover.

57:25.152 --> 57:26.882
Caroline Sullivan.

57:26.987 --> 57:31.721
Your father was almost as obsessed
with her as he was with the Candyman.

57:31.825 --> 57:32.555
Why?

57:32.659 --> 57:36.512
There was something of hers
he most desperately wanted.

57:39.791 --> 57:41.722
Her mirror.

57:42.753 --> 57:46.652
Those who witnessed the horror

57:46.757 --> 57:51.616
said that Robitaille's suffering
was so agonizing,

57:51.720 --> 57:58.122
so unbearable, that his soul
became trapped in Caroline's mirror.

57:58.226 --> 58:00.875
And my father thought
he could stop him with it.

58:00.979 --> 58:05.413
Break the mirror, break the curse.

58:06.485 --> 58:08.716
Where's the mirror now?

58:08.820 --> 58:14.764
Who knows? Caroline found it next to
Robitaille's body and disappeared.

58:14.868 --> 58:18.721
There were rumors, of course. Suicide...

58:25.212 --> 58:27.985
Your father never believed that, though.

58:32.344 --> 58:32.982
Let me go.

59:27.816 --> 59:30.047
What do you want from me?

59:30.152 --> 59:33.672
There's a life that grows inside you now.

59:35.699 --> 59:37.262
A daughter.

59:39.453 --> 59:42.724
You cannot change who you are.

01:00:04.478 --> 01:00:06.621
Come on!

01:00:25.957 --> 01:00:27.472
Shit.

01:01:31.690 --> 01:01:35.958
You have a life
that grows inside you now.

01:01:37.696 --> 01:01:39.840
A daughter.

01:01:41.324 --> 01:01:43.468
Oh, Paul.

01:02:07.768 --> 01:02:10.114
Who am I?

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:49.372
The world is turning, brothers
and sisters, fast towards tomorrow.

01:02:49.476 --> 01:02:51.540
And I'm not the man I used to be.

01:02:51.645 --> 01:02:55.294
I got hooves on my shoes
and horns on my head.

01:02:55.398 --> 01:02:57.838
I want life on a platter, medium rare.

01:02:57.943 --> 01:03:03.634
And you can keep the silverware,
cos tonight I'm eatin' with my hands.

01:03:16.336 --> 01:03:18.682
Who's there?

01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:25.821
Robitaille was born
right here in New Orleans.

01:03:26.972 --> 01:03:30.741
- I know.
- I called him in front of Matthew.

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:41.458
All slave births were registered here.

01:03:46.575 --> 01:03:48.755
Daniel Robitaille.

01:03:50.871 --> 01:03:53.430
He was born at the Esplanade Plantation.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.595
That's my family's house.

01:03:59.254 --> 01:04:02.110
That's where I was born.

01:04:04.634 --> 01:04:07.146
There's more.

01:04:11.850 --> 01:04:14.362
If what Matthew believes is true,

01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:17.616
I hope you can stop it.

01:04:19.566 --> 01:04:21.710
God bless you.

01:06:05.005 --> 01:06:07.814
They had a daughter.

01:06:14.639 --> 01:06:17.121
Officer, they told me to make a report.

01:06:17.225 --> 01:06:19.790
Sit down over here.

01:06:19.895 --> 01:06:22.919
Take a look. Take a good look.

01:06:23.023 --> 01:06:26.756
- I can't keep doing this.
- Look! More of your sister's handiwork.

01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:30.009
- No! Annie didn't do that.
- Come on, cut the bullshit!

01:06:30.113 --> 01:06:31.594
I'm on to your sick games!

01:06:31.698 --> 01:06:35.264
- Why do you keep sayin' this?
- You've been coverin' for her all along.

01:06:35.368 --> 01:06:38.809
You don't know what
you're talkin' about! It's him!

01:06:38.914 --> 01:06:41.343
Who? Your friend the Candyman?

01:06:43.335 --> 01:06:45.441
- You afraid, Tarrant?
- Let me go.

01:06:45.545 --> 01:06:47.944
Should we call him?

01:06:48.048 --> 01:06:50.279
- You're crazy.
- Candyman.

01:06:50.383 --> 01:06:52.156
- Candyman.
- No, don't.

01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:55.201
Candyman. Candyman.

01:06:55.305 --> 01:06:57.782
- Don't.
- Candyman.

01:07:10.112 --> 01:07:11.627
No!

01:07:13.365 --> 01:07:14.928
No!

01:07:16.535 --> 01:07:18.430
No!

01:07:36.221 --> 01:07:37.736
Stop!

01:07:38.432 --> 01:07:40.410
I said, stop!

01:08:02.748 --> 01:08:06.939
We were just wondering if you'd seen
Mrs. Tarrant's daughter, Annie.

01:08:07.043 --> 01:08:09.436
No, there's been no activity at all.

01:09:04.850 --> 01:09:06.995
No!

01:09:13.484 --> 01:09:15.629
No!

01:09:16.779 --> 01:09:19.340
No! God, no!

01:09:27.707 --> 01:09:30.689
- Good evening, ma'am.
- Has there been any sign of her?

01:09:30.794 --> 01:09:31.680
No, ma'am.

01:09:35.215 --> 01:09:37.363
Oh, Annie.

01:09:37.466 --> 01:09:39.948
You lied to us from the beginning.

01:09:40.053 --> 01:09:43.703
I've seen the birth certificate.
I've been to the cemetery.

01:09:43.807 --> 01:09:46.162
No, it's not true.

01:09:46.268 --> 01:09:50.835
It's true. Caroline bought the house
because that's where he was born.

01:09:50.939 --> 01:09:54.714
And she raised their daughter
in that house. Your grandmother.

01:09:54.818 --> 01:09:58.718
She was raised a white girl, and no one
suspected the truth. But Daddy did.

01:09:58.822 --> 01:10:04.347
So Daddy started digging.
My father was trying to stop him.

01:10:04.536 --> 01:10:08.887
- But you just kept on lying.
- I did it to protect you.

01:10:10.459 --> 01:10:14.859
Oh, Annie, you just wait until you have
children of your own. You'll understand.

01:10:14.963 --> 01:10:16.485
I'll never lie to my child.

01:10:16.590 --> 01:10:20.197
Your father was tryin' to
destroy everything we had

01:10:20.302 --> 01:10:25.369
- by linkin' our name with that monster.
- So you destroyed it instead,

01:10:25.474 --> 01:10:28.789
- by denying the truth.
- I am not a part of him!

01:10:28.894 --> 01:10:31.667
- We're his family!
- No!

01:10:31.772 --> 01:10:35.755
- We're his blood!
- I will not have you talk like that.

01:10:35.859 --> 01:10:38.925
You can't wash him away with a bottle!

01:10:39.029 --> 01:10:42.011
There is no Candyman.

01:10:42.115 --> 01:10:44.508
He does not exist.

01:10:58.673 --> 01:11:00.569
My child.

01:11:01.176 --> 01:11:05.325
You doubted me...
your own flesh and blood.

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:13.582
Death is a return, you know.

01:11:29.037 --> 01:11:31.181
Annie...

01:11:36.586 --> 01:11:40.225
Annie, it's almost time.

01:11:41.007 --> 01:11:43.354
Time for our journey.

01:11:45.303 --> 01:11:49.702
Soon we'll be together,
just the way I planned.

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:53.990
You cannot resist what is in your blood.

01:11:54.438 --> 01:11:56.084
Our blood.

01:11:59.693 --> 01:12:02.335
Your baby's blood.

01:12:06.450 --> 01:12:08.961
You can't fight what is meant to be.

01:12:10.078 --> 01:12:13.634
The choice will be yours, Annie.

01:12:16.752 --> 01:12:19.098
I'm so sorry.

01:12:21.256 --> 01:12:23.152
No!

01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:28.566
Miss Tarrant!

01:12:31.808 --> 01:12:35.032
Go on! Quick! Go around the back there.

01:12:44.071 --> 01:12:46.417
Annie, I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:12:52.037 --> 01:12:54.852
Ethan's dead.

01:12:54.956 --> 01:12:58.097
I'm sorry. He was shot trying to escape.

01:12:59.461 --> 01:13:04.028
Detective Levesque's body
was found... mutilated.

01:13:04.132 --> 01:13:07.321
The guards assumed...

01:13:08.011 --> 01:13:11.781
I watched the video tape
of what happened in that room.

01:13:12.015 --> 01:13:17.291
Ray's body was torn apart
by somethin' powerful,

01:13:17.395 --> 01:13:19.907
and it wasn't your brother.

01:13:25.737 --> 01:13:28.297
You better hurry before they get here.

01:13:40.585 --> 01:13:43.234
29 minutes to go, New Orleans.

01:13:43.338 --> 01:13:45.815
29 minutes till judgment.

01:13:53.306 --> 01:13:56.539
So get drunk, get fatter, and get fucked.

01:13:56.643 --> 01:14:01.409
Yeah, you're right. I said it.
Y'all can trust the Kingfish.

01:14:28.759 --> 01:14:33.242
The heavens have just opened up on us
and the banks of the Mississippi

01:14:33.346 --> 01:14:35.906
are about to burst.

01:14:39.311 --> 01:14:42.043
I don't think they're gonna
hold it back any more.

01:14:42.147 --> 01:14:45.169
They're as full as the Kingfish's belly.

01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:49.669
Yeah, Mardi Gras.

01:15:33.323 --> 01:15:35.753
Where is it?

01:15:35.909 --> 01:15:37.721
Where is it?

01:15:43.417 --> 01:15:45.513
God damn you!

01:15:56.972 --> 01:15:58.985
The slave quarters.

01:16:10.193 --> 01:16:12.705
Matthew! Oh, my God!

01:16:13.864 --> 01:16:18.464
Are you all right?
I was so worried about you.

01:16:19.619 --> 01:16:21.684
You should go home.

01:16:21.788 --> 01:16:24.437
I knew when you called him, he'd come.

01:16:24.541 --> 01:16:26.606
Like before.

01:16:26.710 --> 01:16:28.733
You were hiding here.

01:16:28.837 --> 01:16:31.397
He's in my dreams, Annie.

01:16:32.299 --> 01:16:35.274
- I know.
- I had to see...

01:16:35.886 --> 01:16:38.659
I wanted to see him for real.

01:16:38.764 --> 01:16:43.577
Matthew, I need to find the mirror.

01:17:21.890 --> 01:17:25.363
It must be down there. Be careful.

01:17:44.579 --> 01:17:45.763
Annie!

01:17:57.426 --> 01:18:00.863
Go back! Get some help, Matthew!

01:18:55.108 --> 01:18:57.538
Annie, don't.

01:19:04.242 --> 01:19:08.059
The mirror is the secret of my strength.

01:19:08.163 --> 01:19:10.723
The keeper of my soul.

01:19:12.626 --> 01:19:15.399
The destiny of our family.

01:19:17.798 --> 01:19:21.906
Annie, our journey begins.

01:19:22.010 --> 01:19:24.605
This is why I brought you here.

01:19:30.811 --> 01:19:33.121
I was not always this way.

01:19:34.314 --> 01:19:36.292
This is who I've become.

01:19:38.860 --> 01:19:41.882
You must see what they did.

01:19:44.032 --> 01:19:49.131
My only sin was to love Caroline,
and to give her a daughter.

01:19:54.418 --> 01:19:57.227
They took everything from me, Annie.

01:19:57.963 --> 01:20:00.695
Let me go.

01:20:00.799 --> 01:20:03.281
My family.

01:20:03.385 --> 01:20:06.407
Did you think
you could get away from us?

01:20:06.721 --> 01:20:10.242
My child. My life.

01:20:12.769 --> 01:20:14.498
No!

01:20:30.203 --> 01:20:32.680
Be my witness.

01:20:41.715 --> 01:20:46.113
See how I became
the reflection of their hatred.

01:20:47.888 --> 01:20:50.036
Their evil.

01:20:50.140 --> 01:20:52.071
Kill him!

01:20:55.645 --> 01:20:59.921
See what it means
to call me by that name.

01:21:00.025 --> 01:21:02.834
Candyman.

01:21:03.403 --> 01:21:08.632
- Candyman.
- Candyman, Candyman.

01:21:09.451 --> 01:21:14.051
- Candyman.
- Sweets to the sweet!

01:22:03.755 --> 01:22:06.267
My pain was unbearable.

01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:11.532
But Caroline's was even greater.

01:22:13.723 --> 01:22:15.997
Let him go!

01:22:16.101 --> 01:22:18.374
Stop her!

01:22:18.478 --> 01:22:20.622
No!

01:22:22.232 --> 01:22:26.120
- Father!
- Caroline.

01:22:33.785 --> 01:22:36.594
You will all be damned.

01:22:37.914 --> 01:22:40.771
You defiled my daughter.

01:22:40.876 --> 01:22:46.686
- Father.
- Could she even look at you now?

01:22:51.928 --> 01:22:55.117
Candyman...

01:23:02.647 --> 01:23:07.461
Now, do you see what was taken from me?

01:23:08.445 --> 01:23:09.628
Yes.

01:23:10.030 --> 01:23:13.052
No! No!

01:23:14.034 --> 01:23:16.933
They killed me, Annie.

01:23:17.037 --> 01:23:20.142
But they could not destroy my soul.

01:23:33.845 --> 01:23:37.947
Join me, Annie. We will go together

01:23:39.434 --> 01:23:41.666
to a world without pain.

01:23:41.770 --> 01:23:43.914
No more pain.

01:23:44.523 --> 01:23:48.162
Death is only the beginning.

01:23:49.111 --> 01:23:52.999
Your cradle will be your grave.

01:23:56.451 --> 01:23:58.766
- Annie.
- Annie.

01:23:58.870 --> 01:24:01.560
- Annie.
- Annie.

01:24:01.665 --> 01:24:03.646
- Annie.
- Annie.

01:24:03.750 --> 01:24:06.148
- Annie.
- Annie.

01:24:06.253 --> 01:24:08.433
Annie.

01:25:10.859 --> 01:25:14.592
- Annie!
- Annie! Annie!

01:25:14.696 --> 01:25:16.344
Annie!

01:25:16.448 --> 01:25:18.888
Grab my arm, Annie!

01:25:18.992 --> 01:25:22.183
- Annie!
- Grab my hand!

01:25:22.287 --> 01:25:25.013
Grab my hand! Come here! Grab my hand!

01:25:37.344 --> 01:25:39.856
Go! Go!

01:25:44.976 --> 01:25:46.491
Go!

01:25:48.814 --> 01:25:49.914
Go!

01:26:04.454 --> 01:26:06.686
Annie,

01:26:06.790 --> 01:26:10.429
the choice is no longer yours.

01:26:12.421 --> 01:26:14.850
You are mine.

01:26:18.552 --> 01:26:22.523
The cradle is your grave, not mine.

01:26:24.683 --> 01:26:26.329
No.

01:27:02.721 --> 01:27:05.067
Go! Let's get out of here. Go!

01:27:40.509 --> 01:27:44.231
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

01:27:53.939 --> 01:27:57.246
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

01:28:15.335 --> 01:28:19.110
Yeah, it's Lent. So y'all take it easy.

01:28:19.214 --> 01:28:21.487
We made it through another one,
New Orleans.

01:28:21.591 --> 01:28:25.065
And the Kingfish hope
you got plenty to atone for.

01:28:26.054 --> 01:28:29.954
Hope you all said
a fond farewell to the flesh.

01:28:30.058 --> 01:28:32.832
Hey, it's the cycle, Crescent City.

01:28:32.936 --> 01:28:35.958
And we are startin' it again.

01:28:49.453 --> 01:28:53.341
- Mommy, let's look at some more.
- Just a few more pages.

01:28:57.961 --> 01:29:00.224
That's your mommy. She's pretty.

01:29:00.505 --> 01:29:03.070
That's right.

01:29:03.175 --> 01:29:05.323
And who's that?

01:29:05.427 --> 01:29:08.743
That little girl is
your great-grandma, Isabel.

01:29:08.847 --> 01:29:11.412
And that's her mommy, Caroline.

01:29:11.516 --> 01:29:13.946
That's my name, too.

01:29:15.437 --> 01:29:18.910
- Who's that?
- That's Isabel's daddy.

01:29:19.566 --> 01:29:24.008
And when you get a little older,
I will tell you a story about him.

01:29:24.112 --> 01:29:28.760
- Tell me now.
- Right now, it's time for your nap.

01:30:37.853 --> 01:30:41.408
Candyman, Candyman,

01:30:41.565 --> 01:30:45.381
Candyman, Candyman,

01:30:45.485 --> 01:30:47.463
- Cand...
- Caroline!

01:30:47.988 --> 01:30:50.132
Go to sleep.

01:30:57.080 --> 01:31:00.435
