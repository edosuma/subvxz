Yo, let's lurk, man. Let's go.

00:15.760 --> 00:17.920
Look, fam, I understand
where you're coming from, innit.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.120
- Cam has to hear from us.
- Yeah, that's right, he does.

00:20.200 --> 00:22.640
Blud, we could do this better
if we take time to think about it!

00:22.720 --> 00:25.200
Cam has to hear back from us,
he has to hear back from us today.

00:25.280 --> 00:28.520
Shout me when you get the straps.
Man'll smoke this fuckin' pussyhole.

00:32.439 --> 00:33.440
[tyres squealing]

00:36.680 --> 00:39.200
[Farah] Fuck's sake, man.

00:40.360 --> 00:42.520
- [Si] Fam, when is this done?
- [Farah] I don't know, man.

00:42.600 --> 00:44.640
We have to find this fuckin' guy
by the end of today.

00:44.720 --> 00:46.800
[Farah] Where the fuck is this brother?
Fuckin' hell, man.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.560
[Si] We've already been down
this fuckin' road.

00:48.640 --> 00:50.120
Turn up here. Turn up here.

00:50.200 --> 00:52.240
- Yo, where's Leyton?
- [Si] He still ain't picking up.

00:52.320 --> 00:53.920
He's probably sick or somethin'.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.200
Yo, bruv? Fucker's in Dalston.

00:56.280 --> 00:58.320
[Farah] Fucker's in a Turkish caff
next to a cinema.

00:58.400 --> 01:00.560
Yo, hurry up and go, man.
This fuckin' pussyhole.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.200
[Jamie] Bruv, let's go!

01:11.480 --> 01:13.280
What were you sayin'
about that re-up again?

01:13.360 --> 01:17.120
Yeah, fam, like I said, brother,
I gave the young guy a Z out of the box.

01:17.200 --> 01:19.560
[conversation continues indistinctly]

01:20.360 --> 01:23.040
[Cornell] Wah gwaan. You look good.
Wah gwaan. Jump up there.

01:31.080 --> 01:33.320

- What you sayin'? You think you're bad?

01:33.400 --> 01:34.760
You fat bitch!

01:34.920 --> 01:36.520
- Fuckin' pussy! You!
- Yeah?

01:36.600 --> 01:37.600
[overlapping chatter]

01:42.040 --> 01:42.880

[grunting]

01:45.280 --> 01:46.880
[groaning]

01:47.280 --> 01:48.320
[woman] Get off me!

01:48.400 --> 01:49.600
[grunting]

01:49.680 --> 01:51.080
Fucking pussy!

01:52.120 --> 01:53.080
Get off me!

01:53.440 --> 01:55.080
[clanging]

01:55.160 --> 01:56.960
Come here, man! You want some, huh?

01:57.040 --> 01:58.720
Fuckin' pussy! [grunts]

01:58.800 --> 02:00.840
[overlapping chatter]

02:00.920 --> 02:02.440
[grunting and yelling]

02:02.520 --> 02:04.400
[Jamie] Fuck! Fuck!

02:04.480 --> 02:06.840
- Jamie, come on! Bruv, let's go, bruv!

02:06.920 --> 02:08.639

02:08.720 --> 02:09.720
Fuckin' pussyhole!

02:09.800 --> 02:11.680
[overlapping chatter]

02:11.760 --> 02:14.640
- Come on, bruv!
- Me and you ain't finished yet!

02:14.720 --> 02:16.200
- Fuckin' pussy!
- Jamie, get in!

02:16.280 --> 02:18.080
- [Farah] Let's get outta here, fam!
- [honking]

02:21.280 --> 02:23.880
[Farah] Fuckin' hell, bruv. Fuckin' mad.

02:24.680 --> 02:26.600
Shit. Bro...

02:26.960 --> 02:28.080
Si got stabbed.

02:28.480 --> 02:30.280
Fuck! Fuck!

02:30.360 --> 02:31.920
- [Farah] Shit!
- [Si] I need to go...

02:32.000 --> 02:33.520
I need to go to hospital. I need to go.

02:33.600 --> 02:35.240
[Jamie] Let's get him
to the hospital, quick!

02:35.320 --> 02:37.040
[Tyrone] Si, stay with me, man!
Are you all right? Fuck!

02:37.120 --> 02:38.520
Fuck's sake, man!

02:38.600 --> 02:39.920
[Farah] Shit, man! Fuck!

02:40.000 --> 02:41.280
- [Jamie] Fuck's sake!
- [Farah] Oh, fuck!

02:41.840 --> 02:43.960
- [tyres squealing]
- [Jamie] Hold on tight to the wound.

02:44.040 --> 02:46.240
[Tyrone] I knew we should've made
Kit get the straps, fam.

02:46.320 --> 02:48.480
[Jamie] What the fuck you talking about?
Shut up!

02:48.560 --> 02:50.360
Shut up and drive, please.

02:50.640 --> 02:51.680
Fuck!

02:51.760 --> 02:53.640
[Jamie] Aight!
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick!

02:54.360 --> 02:55.280
[groans]

02:55.360 --> 02:57.440
- Let's go, man. Open the fuckin' door!
- [strained breaths]

02:57.520 --> 03:00.600
Go inside. Tell 'em you got stabbed,
and it wasn't your fault. You're innocent!

03:00.680 --> 03:03.160
D'you understand?
Help him up and pray, I'm gone.

03:03.240 --> 03:04.400
Love, love, love!

03:04.480 --> 03:05.520
[Tyrone yells]

03:05.600 --> 03:08.080
[Farah] Move the fuck out of the way, man!
The hell's wrong with you?

03:08.160 --> 03:10.240
Blud, fucking move, man!
Need somebody to help!

03:10.320 --> 03:11.600
We need help now, man! Fuck!

03:11.680 --> 03:13.680
[woman] Please step back, all right.
Relax.

03:13.760 --> 03:14.960
[overlapping chatter]

03:15.040 --> 03:16.800
[Tyrone] He's been stabbed!

03:17.280 --> 03:19.680
- I hear you!
- What fuck is going on? Get me a doctor!

03:20.120 --> 03:23.560
Please step back! Calm down!
I hear you!

03:23.640 --> 03:25.520
- [man] It's London Fields again!
- Come then!

03:25.600 --> 03:27.400
You fuckin' dickhead! Come on, then!

03:27.480 --> 03:28.960
[clamouring]

03:29.040 --> 03:30.040
[Farah] Get off me!

03:30.120 --> 03:32.520
Don't you fuckin' touch me!
Don't fuckin' touch me!

03:32.600 --> 03:34.240
Don't fuckin' touch me, fam!

03:35.240 --> 03:37.880
[Farah] Yeah? What, are you bad?
Are you fuckin' bad or what?

03:38.200 --> 03:40.640
[woman] Move out of my fuckin' way, yo!

03:41.040 --> 03:42.040
Fuck. Shit.

03:42.280 --> 03:43.400
My fuckin' chest.

03:43.960 --> 03:45.960
[clamouring and fighting
continues in background]

03:53.200 --> 03:54.920
Excuse me. Are you looking for someone?

03:55.000 --> 03:57.080
- Yeah, my sister.
- Okay. Well, what's her name?

03:57.160 --> 03:59.040
- Why you fuckin' asking me questions, man?
- Is she a patient?

03:59.120 --> 04:00.960
Fuck off, man! Fuckin' hell!

04:01.040 --> 04:04.240
- Look, you can't just come...
- Fuck off, you dickhead!

04:04.600 --> 04:07.080
- Right, security!
- Where you at, you pussy, man?

04:07.160 --> 04:09.160
- [nurse] Security, please!
- Fucking bitch!

04:09.520 --> 04:10.920
[Farah] Fuckin' lesbian!

04:11.000 --> 04:13.040
Hi, yeah. Security, now!

04:24.160 --> 04:25.160
What, you got fleas?

04:25.560 --> 04:26.440
What?

04:28.080 --> 04:30.000
- Fuck, are you using?
- What?

04:30.080 --> 04:31.160
No, bruv.

04:32.320 --> 04:34.880
Don't fuckin' lie to me, you know.
I got eyes in my head.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.320
You're fuckin' using, you're a mug.

04:40.920 --> 04:42.840
- Who got you using?
- No one.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.080
Can I sit?

05:01.840 --> 05:02.960
[Dushane sighs]

05:11.200 --> 05:12.280
You're looking well.

05:15.720 --> 05:17.280
Did you come here to say something?

05:18.920 --> 05:19.840
Say it.

05:22.880 --> 05:26.840
Look, I got this ting, yeah?
It's a urgent ting.

05:26.920 --> 05:28.720
- I wanna bring you in on it.
- [chuckles]

05:28.800 --> 05:30.520
- Bruv, can you hear me out, yeah?
- No.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.120
No.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.760
You try listening to me for a change.

05:36.040 --> 05:37.000
Aight.

05:38.320 --> 05:39.520
Go on, I'm listenin'.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.320
When I'm talkin', Dushane,
don't mean you're listenin'.

05:41.760 --> 05:44.400
- Fuckin' hell, man.
- Yeah, 'cause you always do it.

05:44.480 --> 05:47.400
I talk, and you just do
what you decided to do already.

05:51.560 --> 05:52.560
It's disrespectful.

05:52.640 --> 05:54.280
You know I respect you, fam.

05:55.240 --> 05:56.400
I always have.

05:57.280 --> 05:58.400
Keep it real, though.

05:58.840 --> 06:00.200
From school days, man.

06:01.520 --> 06:03.600
You always said us, but you meant me.

06:05.120 --> 06:07.920
You always said it was our crew,
but it was always your crew.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.680
- [sighs]
- Anytime you said it was our plan,

06:09.760 --> 06:11.120
it was always your plan.

06:11.200 --> 06:13.640
Yeah, I think you're reading that
a bit wrong, cuz.

06:13.720 --> 06:14.840
It was always us.

06:16.840 --> 06:18.640
- We were equal partners, bruv.
- [scoffs]

06:19.520 --> 06:20.560
We weren't equal.

06:21.040 --> 06:22.160
We weren't partners.

06:23.720 --> 06:27.560
Bruv, look, I thought I would've achieved
so much more by now, you know?

06:28.360 --> 06:29.280
You feel me?

06:31.160 --> 06:32.760
I'm 36 years old.

06:34.960 --> 06:36.080
I ain't got no woman,

06:36.480 --> 06:37.520
no kids,

06:38.200 --> 06:41.000
fuckin' sleeping on Dris's stinkin' sofa.

06:43.120 --> 06:44.600
My mum's sick, fam.

06:46.080 --> 06:48.080
And I've got a gangster
putting a gun to my head,

06:48.160 --> 06:51.240
telling me he's gonna kill my cousin
if I don't come up with the ten bags.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.840
If you told me I'd be in that
fuckin' situation six years ago,

06:55.920 --> 06:57.560
I would've laughed in your face.

07:02.040 --> 07:02.880
Look, man...

07:04.280 --> 07:06.600
I had a lot of time to think
in Jamaica, bro.

07:08.320 --> 07:09.400
A lot of time.

07:12.920 --> 07:14.440
Whatever mindset to get to the top,

07:14.520 --> 07:16.920
you have to fuckin' fight
for what you want, fam.

07:17.240 --> 07:19.680
You see, once you get there,
when you're on top,

07:21.200 --> 07:22.920
that's a different ball game, fam.

07:24.880 --> 07:26.840
Then you need real people around you,

07:28.840 --> 07:30.480
and you have to keep them close.

07:31.160 --> 07:32.600
Obviously, I didn't do that.

07:34.200 --> 07:35.200
Hands up.

07:38.480 --> 07:39.760
That's what I've learned.

07:43.800 --> 07:44.800
There you go.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.800
Just doing it again, man.

07:50.640 --> 07:52.280
It's always about you, Dushane.

07:53.280 --> 07:55.800
What you've learned,
what you need, what you want.

07:58.480 --> 08:00.360
I never hear my name in anything you say.

08:00.440 --> 08:03.640
Bruv, what the fuck do you want me to do?
What do you want me to say?

08:03.720 --> 08:07.000
You want me to beg you?
I'm trying to rectify the situation, bro.

08:09.240 --> 08:10.600
I have a connect.

08:11.360 --> 08:13.000
The supply is already pattern to sell.

08:14.560 --> 08:16.520
All I need is ten bags, down payment.

08:16.600 --> 08:18.080
So you've come to me.

08:18.160 --> 08:20.200
[scoffs] Bruv, the last time I saw you,

08:20.280 --> 08:23.200
you were walking away
with a big fuckin' bag of money, bro.

08:24.240 --> 08:25.200
I ain't got it.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.480
So where's it gone? What happened?

08:28.080 --> 08:29.400
I got nicked.

08:31.520 --> 08:32.840
Police took it.

08:34.520 --> 08:37.000
So what you're saying to me,
the feds took everything, Sully?

08:40.440 --> 08:41.320
No.

08:42.840 --> 08:45.360
I got a few bags put away,
but that's for my thing.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.200
Somethin' I got going on.

08:48.280 --> 08:50.600
Yeah, well,
I don't know what you got goin' on.

08:51.120 --> 08:53.640
But you see, this thing,
what I'm talking about...

08:55.480 --> 08:56.800
If we do this,

08:58.280 --> 08:59.200
we're back, bro.

08:59.680 --> 09:00.920
We're unstoppable.

09:02.040 --> 09:02.920
Trust me.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.120
[sighs]

09:05.240 --> 09:06.120
Yeah?

09:06.360 --> 09:07.360
Back on top.

09:11.120 --> 09:12.360
We can do it, fam.

09:14.200 --> 09:15.280
What you sayin'?

09:22.200 --> 09:23.080
No.

09:26.480 --> 09:27.840
And I ain't your family.

09:32.160 --> 09:33.400
[sighs]

09:35.440 --> 09:36.760
That's how you feel, yeah?

09:37.800 --> 09:40.160
Sorry about your mum, though, for real.

09:45.760 --> 09:47.960
[Sully] Yo, Jase, I didn't mean
to switch on you.

09:48.280 --> 09:49.520
But don't lie to me.

09:49.840 --> 09:50.760
Okay.

09:52.040 --> 09:54.640
When I find out who got you using,
I'll fuckin' kill 'em.

09:56.600 --> 09:58.000
- Aight?
- Yeah.

09:59.360 --> 10:00.800
And I'll take your sandwich.

10:01.040 --> 10:01.920
[chuckles]

10:02.480 --> 10:05.000
- Come on, man. Where's the station?
- St Pancras.

10:05.720 --> 10:06.880
[Sully] Something I gotta do.

10:23.400 --> 10:25.120
[Jason] Bruv, call her.

10:27.640 --> 10:29.280
- Why don't you call her?
- [Sully murmurs]

10:30.840 --> 10:32.200
- Do you want me to call her?
- [tsks]

10:37.160 --> 10:38.440
How do I look, Jason?

10:39.040 --> 10:39.880
What?

10:43.880 --> 10:44.960
How do I look?

10:46.320 --> 10:47.160
Hm?

10:47.520 --> 10:48.480
Dunno.

10:48.760 --> 10:50.160
Good, I suppose.

10:50.880 --> 10:52.280
Suppose. [chuckles]

10:53.240 --> 10:54.360
[Sully sighs]

10:56.000 --> 10:57.440
That right there's my little girl.

10:58.160 --> 10:59.560
So that's your family too.

11:03.680 --> 11:05.360
When her daddy comes home,

11:06.880 --> 11:11.040
that little girl needs to be standing
in front of a hero.

11:13.400 --> 11:15.440
Not a fuckin' con in prison stink.

11:18.640 --> 11:20.240
That's all I am right now,

11:21.520 --> 11:23.000

22:42.840 --> 22:43.880
Imagine that.

22:43.960 --> 22:45.200
I haven't, yeah?

22:45.680 --> 22:48.200
- But I don't think I'd want to either.
- Why?

22:49.000 --> 22:50.240
Like, 'cause...

22:50.600 --> 22:52.480
I'd just feel like I'm out of place.

22:55.680 --> 22:57.440
[Sully] See, when man was young, yeah?

22:58.720 --> 23:02.920
What we used to call a holiday, yeah,
was, like, me and my little sister

23:03.000 --> 23:04.600
going to check my nan in Birmingham.

23:04.680 --> 23:05.520
[both chuckle]

23:05.600 --> 23:07.440
That's what we used to call holidays
back then.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.640
[Jason] What?
And you didn't go to the beach there?

23:10.720 --> 23:12.120
The beach in Birmingham, blud?

23:12.200 --> 23:14.240
- Yeah. Ain't there one?
- Are you stupid?

23:14.320 --> 23:15.160
[laughs]

23:15.240 --> 23:16.520
You're so du... D'you know what?

23:16.600 --> 23:19.400
I refuse to believe
that you're fuckin' serious right now.

23:19.480 --> 23:20.560
[laughs]

23:20.640 --> 23:22.120
You're an arsehole, you know.

23:27.920 --> 23:28.960
All right, Sully?

23:29.640 --> 23:31.760
You havin' a swim
or gettin' your toes wet?

23:32.440 --> 23:36.040
Tell you one thing, that water's
always fuckin' freezin', isn't it?

23:36.120 --> 23:38.640
[Sully] Fuckin' joker. What you sayin'?
You good?

23:38.720 --> 23:40.160
Yeah, I'm good, mate. You?

23:40.240 --> 23:41.720
Yeah, man. You've grown.

23:41.800 --> 23:42.960
It's been a long time.

23:46.600 --> 23:47.960
[Sully] So where's this yard, then?

23:48.560 --> 23:51.680
Just round the corner. You go up,
do a left, do a right, it's there.

24:04.320 --> 24:05.600
Have you seen the news?

24:06.520 --> 24:08.160
You can't see who they are.
Can't even see their faces.

24:08.240 --> 24:09.240
[scoffs]

24:09.920 --> 24:10.920
Well, that's a plus.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.920
Look, I understand the market
you're selling to

24:13.000 --> 24:14.440
is different to what I'm used to,

24:14.800 --> 24:17.520
and you know how that works
better than I do, but things like this,

24:17.840 --> 24:19.680
this is what gets people arrested.

24:19.760 --> 24:23.360
I was with a girl last night. Nice girl.
She had nothin' to do with this.

24:23.440 --> 24:24.960
Cam drives by and opens up.

24:25.040 --> 24:26.880
Tries to lay me out
and shoots her instead.

24:26.960 --> 24:28.400
Now she's shot in the neck.

24:29.080 --> 24:30.200
I can't let that go.

24:30.600 --> 24:31.440
Oh, yeah.

24:32.080 --> 24:33.080
I understand.

24:34.040 --> 24:37.120
And don't get me wrong,
I knew there was gonna be problems.

24:37.280 --> 24:39.120
But I hoped you'd be able
to handle them better.

24:39.200 --> 24:42.000
I just told you.
Cam set me a message, I had to reply.

24:42.360 --> 24:43.200
Hm.

24:43.800 --> 24:44.840
Is Cam dead?

24:45.840 --> 24:46.680
No.

24:47.320 --> 24:48.640
So my point is, Jamie,

24:49.320 --> 24:50.880
Cam didn't get your reply.

24:53.800 --> 24:54.840
[Lizzie sighs]

24:54.920 --> 24:56.600
Look, I've spoken this over with Jeffrey,

24:56.680 --> 24:59.280
and we do still want
to get into business with you.

25:00.720 --> 25:02.360
But we need to feel confident.

25:04.040 --> 25:05.160
[car door opens]

25:09.600 --> 25:11.040
[engine starts]

25:19.320 --> 25:21.560
It's just down at the end over here.

25:22.600 --> 25:23.640
Who's in the house?

25:23.720 --> 25:25.000
It's the immigrants, bro.

25:25.080 --> 25:27.560
They're cool, though.
They won't cause no problems.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.280
- So how long you been using?
- What?

25:33.640 --> 25:36.520
- Just tell me what I asked ya.
- It's nothin' serious, bro.

25:36.600 --> 25:39.960
I just, you know, sometimes
I take a hit every now and then.

25:40.040 --> 25:42.160
You got him on somethin'? Hm?

25:43.400 --> 25:45.240
It's a fuckin' question.
D'you give him drugs?

25:45.320 --> 25:47.400
- Only a couple of times.
- How many times?

25:47.480 --> 25:50.120
- Like, I think, once. I don't know.
- How many times?

25:50.200 --> 25:51.760
- I don't know...
- What was it? What'd you give him?

25:51.840 --> 25:53.600
- Just weed, man, weed.
- Weed? Weed?

25:53.920 --> 25:55.160
- Yeah...
- Don't fuckin' insult me. Weed?

25:55.240 --> 25:58.160
- I might've given him dark a few...
- Of course you fuckin'... Look at him!

25:58.240 --> 25:59.680
- He didn't mean to.
- Fuckin' shut up!

25:59.760 --> 26:00.960
He didn't mean to.

26:01.400 --> 26:02.880
- It was hardly ever.
- He didn't mean to...

26:02.960 --> 26:05.520
Gem, I swear, if you ever fuckin'
give him anything again,

26:05.600 --> 26:07.200
I don't give a fuck what it is, you know.

26:07.280 --> 26:09.560
Weed, pills, white, B,
I don't give a fuck.

26:09.640 --> 26:10.880
I'll bury you, you know.

26:12.200 --> 26:13.760
And you, you fuckin' idiot.

26:14.520 --> 26:16.520
- How stupid could you be, man?
- I'm sorry.

26:16.600 --> 26:18.800
Just shut... [tsks]
We don't take that shit.

26:19.360 --> 26:20.480
We don't do that!

26:24.840 --> 26:26.400
Bro, why you tellin' him for, man?

26:26.480 --> 26:27.640
[Sully] Where's the house?

26:28.440 --> 26:29.680
It's there, man.

26:59.840 --> 27:01.720
[Sully] So Gem's told you
what we need, yeah?

27:04.360 --> 27:07.080
Gem, I swear, if you're gonna tell me
this guy don't fuckin' talk English...

27:07.160 --> 27:09.240
He speaks English, man. Don't you, Faez?

27:09.800 --> 27:11.400
[Gem] I explained what's gonna happen.

27:11.840 --> 27:12.920
He's cool with it.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.040
Two, three days max.
All I need is somewhere to sleep.

27:16.320 --> 27:18.320
Bro, it ain't even gonna take that long.

27:18.400 --> 27:20.480
People round here,
they're bare thirsty, bro.

27:20.720 --> 27:23.480
Bro! Gem, can he fuckin' understand me?

27:23.560 --> 27:25.160
I understand what you want.

27:25.240 --> 27:26.760
- [Sully] Yeah?
- Yeah.

27:26.840 --> 27:28.680
Well, thanks for fuckin' joining us.

27:29.360 --> 27:32.920
Listen, we're gonna stay here for
as long as it takes to sell this shit,

27:33.120 --> 27:34.080
then we're gone.

27:35.280 --> 27:37.640
- You pay me for stay.
- [Sully] Look at me.

27:37.720 --> 27:38.720
I pay you for stay.

27:39.080 --> 27:40.080
You pay me now.

27:41.800 --> 27:43.480
[sighs] Is he mad?

27:44.040 --> 27:46.000
Hm? Is he on fuckin' drugs?

27:46.080 --> 27:48.760
- You been givin' him shit?
- Doesn't even do drugs, Faez.

27:48.840 --> 27:49.960
- He don't do drugs?
- No.

27:50.280 --> 27:53.080
- Why's he got that junkie look then?
- He's a different kind of hungry.

27:53.680 --> 27:55.640
He's hungry 'cause he ain't
got food to eat.

27:56.240 --> 27:57.360
You pay some now.

27:57.440 --> 27:59.240
No, that's not how it works.

27:59.560 --> 28:00.720
I pay you when I leave.

28:01.240 --> 28:02.960
You don't tell no one we're here.

28:03.400 --> 28:04.360
Yeah? No one.

28:04.600 --> 28:05.720
Now, do you get that?

28:06.240 --> 28:08.200
- Yes.
- Okay, good.

28:08.800 --> 28:09.640
Go.

28:09.720 --> 28:11.440
Go get a tea or somethin', man.

28:12.080 --> 28:12.920
[tsks]

28:18.520 --> 28:20.400
How we gonna
tell the customers the shop's open?

28:20.480 --> 28:21.880
Don't worry about that.

28:22.080 --> 28:23.200
- Don't worry?
- No.

28:23.520 --> 28:24.960
Don't worry about that.

28:25.480 --> 28:26.480
[loud thud]

28:26.720 --> 28:27.800
[man] Fuckin' knobheads!

28:27.880 --> 28:29.080
[clamouring]

28:29.160 --> 28:31.640
Go back home, you fuckin' pussy! Cunts!

28:31.720 --> 28:34.600
[Gem] The joke is it'll be them lot
lining up to get their food tonight.

28:36.480 --> 28:37.800
That's a funny thing?

28:39.520 --> 28:42.120
- Where's the toilet in this place?
- [Gem] Downstairs, man.

28:50.920 --> 28:52.840
[baby cooing]

28:55.800 --> 28:58.720
[baby crying]

28:58.800 --> 28:59.800
[Sully] So sorry.

29:00.240 --> 29:01.360
Just heard a noise.

29:04.280 --> 29:05.800
Man had an undy at that stall there,

29:06.160 --> 29:08.000
then the youts clocked him in the station.

29:08.600 --> 29:09.560
So where is he now?

29:10.040 --> 29:12.800
Obviously, man had a little chat
with him, innit, bruv.

29:13.080 --> 29:15.320
Make sure none of these lot
are holding anything, you know.

29:15.400 --> 29:16.560
Yeah, I spoke to them already,

29:16.640 --> 29:18.800
but we're gonna have
a problem when the food comes in.

29:18.880 --> 29:20.720
There's already an issue with that.

29:20.800 --> 29:23.160
My man wants a deposit. Ten bags.

29:23.920 --> 29:24.760
And?

29:25.160 --> 29:26.440
And I want you to get it.

29:26.520 --> 29:27.360
What?

29:27.440 --> 29:29.240
Bro, you need to start fuckin'
pullin' your weight.

29:29.320 --> 29:31.520
What you sayin'? I don't
pull my fuckin' weight round here?

29:31.600 --> 29:34.920
Dris, I need ten bags.
I don't care how you get it.

29:36.520 --> 29:39.440
- [Jaq] Bruv, what the fuck's his problem?
- Shut your fuckin' mouth, man.

29:39.520 --> 29:40.960
Flash prick, you know.

29:43.680 --> 29:45.480
The fuck you let him
talk to you like that?

29:45.560 --> 29:46.680
[Dris scoffs, tsks]

29:57.560 --> 29:58.720
[sighs]

30:01.200 --> 30:02.560
- [knocking]
- [Stefan] Comin' in!

30:02.640 --> 30:04.680
Bruv, what's wrong with you? Get out, man.

30:04.760 --> 30:07.520
- You can't see man's in the bath?
- I got my history essay back, you know.

30:07.760 --> 30:11.120
Miss said one of the best in the class.
I might study history at uni, you know.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.480
But not if, like,
the record deal comes in,

30:13.560 --> 30:16.880
'cause being a recording artist
is way better than doing history.

30:16.960 --> 30:19.280
It's less boring.
Do you know about the Reformation?

30:19.360 --> 30:20.760
Bro, I need some privacy. You get me?

30:20.840 --> 30:24.160
Yeah, my history essay was about
the Reformation and King Henry VIII.

30:24.880 --> 30:28.040
King Henry VIII was some fat guy.
Yeah, he had, like, six wives.

30:28.120 --> 30:29.240
Chopped off all their heads.

30:29.640 --> 30:32.040
Miss said one of the best in the class.
Even better than Ats's.

30:32.120 --> 30:33.520
Wait, why are you telling me all of this?

30:33.600 --> 30:35.760
'Cause you like it
when I do somethin' good.

30:37.720 --> 30:39.080
Stefan, what have you done?

30:40.840 --> 30:41.680
Nothin'.

30:41.760 --> 30:43.680
Stef, you know better
than to tell me lies, innit?

30:48.720 --> 30:49.880
Me and Ats...

30:50.840 --> 30:52.360
We missed school.

30:52.440 --> 30:54.640
So that's what the school
was calling me about today.

30:54.720 --> 30:56.000
I never even picked up.

30:56.080 --> 30:57.960
Ats's mum got kicked out of her job.

30:58.040 --> 30:59.440
And Immigration came by the yard,

30:59.520 --> 31:01.200
saying that she not allowed to be
in the country no more.

31:01.280 --> 31:03.320
So what's that got to do
with you missing school?

31:03.400 --> 31:05.880
So we decided to make a business plan,
me and Ats.

31:06.560 --> 31:09.320
So she can have extra Ps.
Pay for the rent and stuff.

31:09.440 --> 31:11.840
So, we decided to sell burgers
to the kids in school.

31:11.920 --> 31:13.680
- Burgers?
- Yeah, for a pound each.

31:14.880 --> 31:17.480
[tsks] Listen, just make sure
you don't miss school again.

31:17.560 --> 31:20.640
And make sure you catch up with all
the lessons that you missed today, yeah?

31:20.720 --> 31:21.960
Ay, ay, ay.

31:23.040 --> 31:25.560
- Who's Tilly?
- Nothing, man! Hurry up and get out.

31:26.560 --> 31:27.960
- Get out.
- Ay, what?

31:28.040 --> 31:29.400
Hurry up, man!

31:29.880 --> 31:31.720
[mobile phone vibrating]

31:32.680 --> 31:33.600
[door shuts]

31:35.040 --> 31:35.920
Hello?

31:39.680 --> 31:40.640
Who's this?

31:43.760 --> 31:45.040
I said, who's this?

31:49.240 --> 31:50.320
[sighs]

31:53.960 --> 31:55.160
You like your dinner?

31:59.400 --> 32:00.960
I got something for you.

32:01.600 --> 32:03.520
For me? You've got something for me?

32:04.120 --> 32:05.320
Close your eyes.

32:07.720 --> 32:08.680
What are you doing?

32:08.760 --> 32:10.800
Close your eyes. It'll be a surprise.

32:12.080 --> 32:13.160
Okay.

32:21.680 --> 32:23.560
Okay. You can open them now.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.080
What is this?

32:28.600 --> 32:29.640
It's money.

32:29.720 --> 32:32.000
[Amma] I know it's money.
Where did you get it?

32:32.080 --> 32:34.360
[Ats] Me and Stef, we sold burgers.

32:34.840 --> 32:37.840
We made burgers and sold 'em.
This is the profit.

32:42.760 --> 32:44.280
I thought it would make you happy.

32:45.400 --> 32:46.680
[chair scrapes on floor]

32:51.440 --> 32:52.840
[Amma sighs]

32:52.920 --> 32:55.960
Listen, you know you never have to worry.

32:57.720 --> 32:59.360
I'll always be here for you.

33:00.880 --> 33:02.760
- You know that?
- I know.

33:08.160 --> 33:09.360
[door opens]

33:15.240 --> 33:16.160
[door shuts]

33:22.120 --> 33:24.040
- [Jaq] Wah gwaan.
- [Lauryn] You all right?

33:24.120 --> 33:26.160
- Wah gwaan.
- Dris told me I had to get him ten bags.

33:26.440 --> 33:27.600
Said it was for you.

33:28.400 --> 33:31.200
- So you got the ten bags, yeah?
- [tsks] No, not on me.

33:31.680 --> 33:33.240
But she knows where to get it.

33:35.160 --> 33:37.160
There's this woman
and she lives in the borough,

33:37.240 --> 33:40.240
but, like, not Summerhouse,
down near the Common.

33:40.320 --> 33:42.680
And this woman has a lot of money.

33:43.560 --> 33:45.600
- And?
- She's got a lotta tom.

33:45.840 --> 33:47.080
Keeps it in the house.

33:47.800 --> 33:50.040
And guess what?
She ain't even in the house now.

33:50.120 --> 33:52.480
She's in her other house
in the south of France.

33:53.080 --> 33:54.560
Who else lives in her yard?

33:55.120 --> 33:57.880
Just the daughter, innit.
But she's with her in France.

33:58.560 --> 34:00.000
- No husband?
- Nah.

34:00.080 --> 34:01.480
She got rid of him last year.

34:01.560 --> 34:05.000
He weren't pullin' his weight,
economically speaking. [chuckles]

34:06.800 --> 34:09.560
Well, obviously, the house
is gonna be belled up by now, innit?

34:09.639 --> 34:13.480
Nah, man. This woman is so clueless
when it comes to anything practical.

34:13.560 --> 34:16.199
She can't even work a dishwasher or a TV.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.320
She kept trippin' the alarm,
so she don't use it no more.

34:19.880 --> 34:21.639
By the door,
there's, like, a stone hedgehog,

34:21.719 --> 34:23.159
some, like, ornament ting.

34:23.400 --> 34:24.679
Keys are underneath.

34:25.199 --> 34:26.960
You wouldn't even have to break in.

34:29.800 --> 34:30.639
For real, yeah?

34:30.719 --> 34:31.920
- Yeah, man.
- Pound.

34:36.280 --> 34:37.520
How do you lot know her?

34:38.920 --> 34:40.000
Shelley, innit.

34:41.159 --> 34:43.719
She does the woman's shellacs
and beauty treatments.

34:45.679 --> 34:46.760
[Jaq chuckles]

34:46.840 --> 34:47.800
Aight, man.

34:48.760 --> 34:49.719
Cool.

34:52.360 --> 34:53.239
[tsks]

34:53.600 --> 34:55.719
- [Lauryn] It's like that, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

34:58.760 --> 35:00.120
[Lauryn] No cup of tea, nothin'.

35:01.120 --> 35:02.520
[door opens]

35:04.720 --> 35:05.560
[door shuts]

35:06.320 --> 35:07.200
[tsks]

35:08.480 --> 35:09.560
Fuck's sake.

35:12.840 --> 35:13.760
[tsks]

35:21.360 --> 35:22.440
All right, Dris.

35:23.200 --> 35:24.040
Yo.

35:25.160 --> 35:27.920
Bruv, get a car
and come and pick me up, yeah?

35:29.280 --> 35:30.280
[sighs]

35:33.200 --> 35:34.160
You know what?

35:36.280 --> 35:38.440
I've never burgled a house before,
you know?

35:40.800 --> 35:42.920
Anyone comes, make sure you text me, yeah?

35:43.560 --> 35:44.600
You're good, fam.

36:36.840 --> 36:38.840
[lock clicking]

36:41.080 --> 36:42.280
[door opens]

36:42.920 --> 36:44.320
[keys jangling]

36:44.400 --> 36:45.320
[woman] Nah.

36:50.840 --> 36:53.280
My brain can't handle any more Chaucer.

36:54.600 --> 36:56.800
Come over to mine,
and we can do it together.

36:57.240 --> 36:58.640
Yeah, and then we can watch a movie.

36:58.720 --> 37:00.360
No, I promise we won't get caught.

37:00.440 --> 37:02.640
If you stay over,
we can tidy up in the morning.

37:02.720 --> 37:05.040
Yes, you know what, I will.
I'll just invite everyone else.

37:05.120 --> 37:06.760
[woman] Yeah, then we can watch a movie.

37:06.840 --> 37:09.240
If you bring the popcorn and drinks,
'cause my mum's away.

37:17.760 --> 37:19.440
I think there's someone in the house.

37:25.080 --> 37:26.520
[woman] I'm calling the police!

37:32.200 --> 37:34.720
Bruv, didn't I tell you
to fuckin' text me or s...

37:35.600 --> 37:36.520
Yo.

37:37.240 --> 37:39.400
Yo! Yo, fam!

37:40.080 --> 37:41.000
Dris!

37:41.680 --> 37:42.560
Fuck!

37:46.080 --> 37:47.200
Fam, come on.

37:47.600 --> 37:48.760
Come on, brother.

37:49.040 --> 37:50.040
Fuck.

37:50.200 --> 37:51.920
[panting]

37:52.000 --> 37:53.120
Fuck's sake.

37:53.600 --> 37:54.560
Shit.

37:56.400 --> 37:58.400
[Dushane panting]

38:24.200 --> 38:26.120
Now they're gonna know
the food's here, fam.

38:26.200 --> 38:27.720
Big man ting.

38:29.200 --> 38:31.800
Oi. Oi, bro. Save some for me, bro.

38:32.400 --> 38:33.680
Go on. Light, light, light.

38:34.560 --> 38:36.480
- Yo, what are you man doing?
- [Gem] Quick, bruv.

38:36.840 --> 38:37.840
Oh, shit.

38:40.720 --> 38:42.360
[Gem and Jason laugh]

38:42.440 --> 38:44.080
I swear, I'll knock
one of you fuckers out.

38:44.160 --> 38:46.000
- [fireworks pop]
- Why are you doing that to me?

38:46.760 --> 38:47.920
You fuckin' idiot.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.560
[Sully chuckles]

38:49.640 --> 38:50.880
You little shit!

38:50.960 --> 38:52.880
Aight, aight, it's cool!
Aight, you man...

38:54.120 --> 38:56.120
[indistinct chatter]

39:04.200 --> 39:06.720
Hello. Yeah, I'm here to see someone.

39:08.440 --> 39:10.720
- They said I should be here.
- What's the name?

39:10.840 --> 39:12.320
Tilly. Tilly Peters.

39:13.560 --> 39:15.960
The doctor's in with Tilly Peters now.

39:16.040 --> 39:18.680
I think he's just finishing up.
Just be a minute.

39:18.760 --> 39:20.280
Would you like to take a seat?

39:48.640 --> 39:49.640
There she is.

39:50.080 --> 39:51.000
Thank you.

39:59.760 --> 40:00.800
[mobile phone vibrating]

40:00.880 --> 40:02.000
[door opens]

40:03.560 --> 40:04.720
[door shuts]

40:09.560 --> 40:10.600
Who are you?

40:12.960 --> 40:14.200
I'm Tilly's dad.

40:19.720 --> 40:21.400
She suffered brain damage.

40:22.720 --> 40:23.760
[man] See, you look at her.

40:26.720 --> 40:28.280
They said they don't know how bad it is.

40:32.400 --> 40:33.600
She's my child.

40:34.480 --> 40:35.800
She's all I've got.

40:38.560 --> 40:40.200
I don't know anything about you.

40:42.560 --> 40:44.720
I don't want to know anything
about you either.

40:45.880 --> 40:49.080
I'm glad you've seen her, just so maybe
you'll know what happens to people.

40:49.160 --> 40:51.840
To flesh and blood. Innocent people.

40:52.520 --> 40:55.120
Just because you and your friends
wanna make some easy money.

41:06.560 --> 41:07.520
Don't come back.

41:54.080 --> 41:57.120
[indistinct chatter]

42:06.600 --> 42:07.520
[Gem] Thanks, mate.

42:11.720 --> 42:12.680
[whistles]

42:56.640 --> 42:58.200
Been proper hard on you, innit?

42:58.840 --> 42:59.760
Yeah.

43:02.200 --> 43:05.200
Hey, listen. See, when man was in jail,
and that, and you were shouting me,

43:05.280 --> 43:06.440
mad respect for that.

43:07.240 --> 43:10.680
I've got you, bro.
Just like how you've always had me, man.

43:12.720 --> 43:13.720
How's your mum?

43:14.400 --> 43:15.320
She died.

43:15.840 --> 43:16.760
She...

43:17.200 --> 43:18.080
What?

43:18.560 --> 43:19.640
She died.

43:20.720 --> 43:22.080
What do you mean, she died?

43:22.440 --> 43:24.640
Bro? You didn't tell me that.

43:25.320 --> 43:27.280
Just didn't think you would wanna know.

43:29.520 --> 43:31.360
What the fuck, man? What happened?

43:31.680 --> 43:32.760
How'd she die?

43:32.840 --> 43:35.200
Well, her and this fella, they went out.

43:35.280 --> 43:38.880
It started raining. They got cold
and came home and put the oven on.

43:40.920 --> 43:42.480
- The oven?
- Yeah.

43:44.040 --> 43:45.040
And what happened?

43:45.320 --> 43:46.480
To get warm, innit.

43:47.600 --> 43:49.480
Jase, you're fuckin' losin' me here, bro.

43:49.560 --> 43:52.120
[scoffs] If they were cold,
why didn't they put the fire on?

43:52.200 --> 43:55.520
Can't. The fire was electric
and the oven was gas.

43:56.640 --> 43:57.920
And the electric was cut.

43:58.240 --> 44:00.120
And the oven was on.

44:00.520 --> 44:02.520
No, the gas was off. No.

44:02.600 --> 44:05.000
Never mind. Fuck that.
What happened to your mum?

44:05.560 --> 44:08.080
Well, they put the oven on
to warm their feet,

44:08.160 --> 44:09.880
but obviously, they got high.

44:09.960 --> 44:12.320
And they fell asleep,
and their feet got burnt.

44:15.240 --> 44:17.280
And that's how she died? Like that?

44:17.360 --> 44:19.160
No, she didn't die till later.

44:19.240 --> 44:22.720
Basically, she got a septic in her foot,
or somethin' like that.

44:22.800 --> 44:25.080
And then she got poison in the blood.

44:25.160 --> 44:28.480
And her foot went all green,
and that's how she died.

44:28.920 --> 44:32.080
But the fella, he's still alive.
I seen him the other day.

44:32.760 --> 44:35.200
He's got an amputated leg,
and he's on crutches.

44:35.360 --> 44:36.560
Fuckin' mad.

44:39.160 --> 44:41.480
Jase, what you're telling me
is fuckin' nuts.

44:42.560 --> 44:43.640
It is what it is.

44:45.680 --> 44:47.600
You ain't got no luck in life, innit?

44:51.320 --> 44:52.280
[sighs]

44:55.320 --> 44:56.520
[sighs]

44:57.160 --> 44:58.840
Look, if you could have anything, yeah,

45:00.320 --> 45:01.760
- what would it be?
- Anything?

45:01.840 --> 45:04.080
If you could do anything,
have anything, what would it be?

45:05.640 --> 45:08.480
I want superpowers, just like Spider-Man.

45:08.560 --> 45:11.200
[chuckles] Fuckin' hell. You're mad.
Not superpowers.

45:11.280 --> 45:14.760
Like, in the real world.
Like, something you could really have.

45:15.720 --> 45:17.880
You know what? To go watch Arsenal play,

45:17.960 --> 45:21.920
'cause they're the best fuckin' team
in the whole Premier League.

45:23.120 --> 45:25.280
[laughs]

45:25.360 --> 45:27.200
[Jason chuckles]

45:27.280 --> 45:29.280
- To go and watch Arsenal.
- Yeah.

45:30.120 --> 45:31.200
All right, it's done.

45:32.400 --> 45:33.920
- No.
- Yeah.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.040
Great. Thank you.

45:36.120 --> 45:37.680
When we get back to the ends, I'll...

45:38.680 --> 45:40.040
I'll take you to watch Arsenal.

45:40.120 --> 45:41.720
Yes!

45:42.600 --> 45:44.280
Fuckin' kick some arse, mate.

45:52.560 --> 45:54.640
Aight, go and check on Gem,
see what he needs.

45:54.920 --> 45:55.800
All right.

45:57.240 --> 45:58.080
Hey, listen.

45:58.160 --> 46:00.840
I want frontline seats,
you know, on the touchline.

46:00.920 --> 46:02.200
Next to the manager.

46:03.080 --> 46:03.920
[Sully] Yeah.

46:10.240 --> 46:12.600
[sombre ambient music playing]

46:12.680 --> 46:14.680
[video game sounding in background]

46:16.520 --> 46:17.520
[Stefan] It's all good.

46:19.320 --> 46:20.640
Let's get this.

46:20.720 --> 46:21.560
[Aaron] Watch that.

46:27.120 --> 46:29.840
- [Stefan] That's hit my... Ugh.
- [Aaron] Shoulda tackled you.

46:30.120 --> 46:31.600
Hey. Watch that.

46:33.480 --> 46:35.840
- [Aaron] Oh, you're lucky.
- [Stefan] That's it, that's it.

46:35.920 --> 46:39.480
[Aaron and Stefan speaking indistinctly]

46:40.280 --> 46:43.000
[Aaron] Watch that.
Yeah, see that interception? Look.

46:43.080 --> 46:44.320
Don't worry, I'll show you.

46:44.400 --> 46:45.560
[Stefan speaking indistinctly]

46:45.640 --> 46:47.320
[Stefan] Great tackle. Set off.

46:47.960 --> 46:48.960
Set.

46:53.280 --> 46:56.160
[conversation continues indistinctly]
