00:05.400 --> 00:06.330
<b>Here I come,</b>

00:07.320 --> 00:08.110
<b>Gon!</b>

00:11.570 --> 00:12.360
<b>Bring it!</b>

00:26.260 --> 00:26.950
<b><i>Ko!</i></b>

00:35.850 --> 00:36.760
<b>Gon!</b>

00:36.860 --> 00:37.870
<b>Are you okay?!</b>

00:40.060 --> 00:41.610
<b>I'm just fine!</b>

00:41.610 --> 00:42.770
<b>The hell you are...</b>

00:43.050 --> 00:45.550
<b>I used <i>Ko</i> to harden my arms and head,</b>

00:45.550 --> 00:48.020
<b>but my legs couldn't take the impact.</b>

00:48.820 --> 00:49.900
<b>However,</b>

00:50.750 --> 00:51.690
<b>next time,</b>

00:51.690 --> 00:52.730
<b>I'll catch it!</b>

02:12.980 --> 02:18.030
<b>Guts x And x Courage</b>

02:19.540 --> 02:22.170
<b>An intense dodgeball match has begun.</b>

02:22.170 --> 02:25.340
<b>Gon was injured by Razor's throw,</b>

02:25.340 --> 02:29.080
<b>but his eyes burn with fire.</b>

02:30.710 --> 02:32.920
<b>Estimating the ball's likely drop point...</b>

02:36.850 --> 02:40.360
<b>Play will resume with Team Gon's 
inside players controlling the ball.</b>

02:40.360 --> 02:43.480
<b>But as the ceiling is considered 
an extension of the floor,</b>

02:43.480 --> 02:45.680
<b>Gon is out.</b>

02:46.420 --> 02:48.750
<b>I'm going to use Back.</b>

02:48.750 --> 02:49.810
<b>But you're...</b>

02:50.340 --> 02:51.190
<b>I'm doing it!</b>

02:51.880 --> 02:53.690
<b>He won't listen to us...</b>

02:54.860 --> 02:57.190
<b>Fine... However!</b>

02:57.190 --> 03:00.830
<b>Don't use Back until we're 
down to two inside players!</b>

03:01.300 --> 03:02.390
<b>Got it?</b>

03:03.520 --> 03:05.280
<b>Now let's start.</b>

03:05.900 --> 03:07.330
<b>Gon, get patched up.</b>

03:12.560 --> 03:16.110
<b>It isn't against the rules to keep 
passing the ball like this, is it?</b>

03:16.110 --> 03:17.540
<b>That is okay.</b>

03:18.470 --> 03:20.240
<b>All right, I'm good now.</b>

03:25.870 --> 03:26.770
<b>Hey!</b>

03:31.200 --> 03:33.950
<b>I'm the type that tends to hold grudges.</b>

03:33.950 --> 03:36.130
<b>Time for payback, Razor!</b>

03:41.070 --> 03:41.820
<b>Take this...</b>

03:43.250 --> 03:44.840
<b><i>Black Goreinu!</i></b>

03:46.720 --> 03:49.690
<b><i>So he can swap the black 
one with other people?</i></b>

03:49.690 --> 03:51.960
<b>You got me good...</b>

03:52.280 --> 03:53.930
<b>That's what you get.</b>

03:53.930 --> 03:55.580
<b>You're out of there!</b>

03:58.150 --> 04:01.640
<b><i>He's out, but he's still able to return inside.</i></b>

04:02.410 --> 04:05.340
<b><i>At least we can force him to use up his Back.</i></b>

04:05.800 --> 04:07.600
<b><i>And the ball is in our outside territory.</i></b>

04:12.030 --> 04:12.850
<b>Huh?</b>

04:18.540 --> 04:19.430
<b>What?</b>

04:26.660 --> 04:27.490
<b>Goreinu!</b>

04:27.980 --> 04:30.450
<b>You have an interesting ability.</b>

04:30.450 --> 04:32.080
<b>You should use it wisely.</b>

04:32.080 --> 04:34.870
<b>Hold on! What was that?!</b>

04:36.730 --> 04:40.120
<b>There's no rule against passing 
the ball to an opponent.</b>

04:41.260 --> 04:45.120
<b>And you're allowed to hit 
people in the face here.</b>

04:45.790 --> 04:48.880
<b>So his attack was also legal.</b>

04:48.880 --> 04:52.020
<b>Had the ball touched the floor, I'd be out.</b>

04:55.270 --> 04:58.260
<b><i>Once the user's unconscious, 
the </i>Nen <i>beast disappears.</i></b>

04:58.750 --> 05:02.510
<b><i>As I suspected, his ability works with 
his direct control, not automatically.</i></b>

05:04.340 --> 05:07.080
<b>If he regains consciousness,</b>

05:07.080 --> 05:10.370
<b>the black ape may begin inside the court.</b>

05:10.370 --> 05:12.660
<b>I don't anticipate that happening, though.</b>

05:13.400 --> 05:17.020
<b>If the interior players are reduced 
to zero before Goreinu wakes up,</b>

05:17.020 --> 05:19.670
<b>the match will be decided.</b>

05:20.020 --> 05:22.300
<b>It's impossible...</b>

05:22.790 --> 05:27.920
<b>Even if he comes to, he won't be in any condition</b>

05:27.920 --> 05:30.180
<b>to remake his <i>Nen</i> beast right away.</b>

05:31.150 --> 05:33.560
<b><i>Inside the court, it's three versus three.</i></b>

05:36.010 --> 05:39.060
<b><i>But we're obviously outmatched.</i></b>

05:39.720 --> 05:41.820
<b><i>Half our players are gone,</i></b>

05:41.820 --> 05:44.490
<b><i>and we only have one 
injured kid on the outside.</i></b>

05:45.340 --> 05:49.450
<b><i>Our opponents have a solid outside team, 
so they can attack from anywhere.</i></b>

05:49.870 --> 05:53.420
<b><i>Razor is still inside, 
without needing to use Back.</i></b>

05:54.020 --> 05:56.580
<b><i>And the ball rebounded to our opponents.</i></b>

05:57.250 --> 05:59.210
<b><i>We're at a clear disadvantage!</i></b>

06:01.030 --> 06:02.420
<b>Well, then...</b>

06:07.310 --> 06:08.340
<b>Who is</b>

06:09.510 --> 06:10.800
<b>up next?</b>

06:14.630 --> 06:15.420
<b><i>Me?</i></b>

06:16.310 --> 06:17.220
<b><i>What do I do?</i></b>

06:17.220 --> 06:19.040
<b><i>It's impossible! I can't catch that!</i></b>

06:19.040 --> 06:20.110
<b><i>I have to dodge!</i></b>

06:22.280 --> 06:23.820
<b><i>It made a sharp turn?</i></b>

06:31.240 --> 06:31.780
<b>Hisoka!</b>

06:33.240 --> 06:34.790
<b><i>Bungee Gum!</i></b>

06:43.080 --> 06:44.640
<b><i>That bastard...</i></b>

06:44.640 --> 06:46.570
<b><i>He got us good.</i></b>

06:46.570 --> 06:48.560
<b><i>He faked going for me,</i></b>

06:48.560 --> 06:51.570
<b><i>when his real goal was taking out 
Bisky and Hisoka in a straight line.</i></b>

06:51.910 --> 06:54.180
<b><i>Actually, he could have</i></b>

06:54.280 --> 06:56.710
<b><i>gambled that I'd dodge left.</i></b>

06:58.660 --> 07:00.100
<b><i>Had I done that...</i></b>

07:03.800 --> 07:05.860
<b>Bisky is out!</b>

07:06.250 --> 07:07.610
<b>Move to the outside court.</b>

07:07.950 --> 07:09.030
<b>What?</b>

07:09.030 --> 07:10.110
<b>Didn't she dodge?</b>

07:11.410 --> 07:12.360
<b>My own fault.</b>

07:12.690 --> 07:13.370
<b>Huh?</b>

07:14.230 --> 07:17.620
<b>This means your clothes count 
as part of your body, right?</b>

07:17.920 --> 07:18.500
<b>Yes.</b>

07:20.280 --> 07:23.250
<b>I was certain she'd dodged it...</b>

07:23.250 --> 07:25.420
<b>We're down to two!</b>

07:25.420 --> 07:28.010
<b>You can't let them get the ball!</b>

07:28.370 --> 07:29.260
<b>Back!</b>

07:31.120 --> 07:33.760
<b>Gon has used Back.</b>

07:34.130 --> 07:35.510
<b>He may move back inside.</b>

07:36.970 --> 07:40.020
<b>Can we really trust a kid with this?</b>

07:40.590 --> 07:42.650
<b>He's no ordinary kid...</b>

07:43.250 --> 07:47.150
<b>He's the only one who's even 
tried to catch Razor's throw.</b>

07:48.570 --> 07:49.760
<b>Are you all right?</b>

07:49.760 --> 07:50.620
<b>Yeah.</b>

07:50.620 --> 07:51.590
<b>Listen to me.</b>

07:51.590 --> 07:53.450
<b>Do not overdo it!</b>

07:53.450 --> 07:54.160
<b>Yeah.</b>

07:57.460 --> 07:58.880
<b>What's one plus one?</b>

07:58.880 --> 07:59.790
<b>Yeah.</b>

08:00.090 --> 08:01.290
<b>This is hopeless.</b>

08:02.110 --> 08:03.190
<b>Okay!</b>

08:03.190 --> 08:05.150
<b>Beat him, even if it kills you!</b>

08:05.150 --> 08:06.040
<b>Osu.</b>

08:07.380 --> 08:08.510
<b>You okay?</b>

08:08.510 --> 08:09.300
<b>Yep.</b>

08:09.800 --> 08:11.840
<b>I've discovered something.</b>

08:12.740 --> 08:16.930
<b>If the ball travels outside the court, 
it becomes much less powerful.</b>

08:17.560 --> 08:20.430
<b>Without using <i>Ko</i>, I only injured a couple fingers.</b>

08:21.220 --> 08:23.760
<b>Then if we avoid Razor's throws,</b>

08:23.760 --> 08:25.590
<b>we will avoid any significant damage.</b>

08:26.840 --> 08:28.440
<b>Exactly so.</b>

08:28.870 --> 08:30.690
<b>That won't be a victory.</b>

08:31.770 --> 08:32.320
<b>Huh?</b>

08:33.380 --> 08:35.230
<b>Don't be stupid...</b>

08:35.230 --> 08:39.460
<b>If we can't win no matter what 
we do, all this is pointless!</b>

08:39.460 --> 08:42.250
<b>You'd better cool down, stupid.</b>

08:42.250 --> 08:43.930
<b>Aren't you mad?</b>

08:43.930 --> 08:44.710
<b>Huh?!</b>

08:45.160 --> 08:47.710
<b>If you'd dodged left, you could've died.</b>

08:48.800 --> 08:49.660
<b>Right?</b>

08:55.670 --> 08:58.100
<b>I'm really pissed off...</b>

09:00.170 --> 09:02.220
<b>I won't settle for some cheap win.</b>

09:03.460 --> 09:05.980
<b>We have to utterly destroy him!</b>

09:09.690 --> 09:11.910
<b>You must have a plan in mind...</b>

09:11.910 --> 09:12.740
<b>Yeah.</b>

09:14.900 --> 09:16.050
<b>I've got this.</b>

09:16.620 --> 09:18.630
<b>Killua, stand over there.</b>

09:24.300 --> 09:27.120
<b>Plant yourself firmly, and hold the ball.</b>

09:28.440 --> 09:29.130
<b>Okay.</b>

09:33.770 --> 09:34.750
<b><i>I get it!</i></b>

09:40.020 --> 09:42.650
<b><i>First comes rock!</i></b>

09:45.980 --> 09:47.770
<b><i>His aura just spiked!</i></b>

09:52.860 --> 09:55.690
<b><i>Rock, paper...</i></b>

09:57.840 --> 09:59.420
<b><i>Rock!</i></b>

10:10.570 --> 10:13.360
<b><i>First comes rock!</i></b>

10:16.590 --> 10:18.800
<b><i>His aura just spiked!</i></b>

10:23.920 --> 10:26.890
<b><i>Rock, paper...</i></b>

10:29.100 --> 10:31.190
<b><i>Rock!</i></b>

10:57.630 --> 11:00.310
<b>Number 13 is out.</b>

11:00.780 --> 11:05.480
<b>Catching the ball while touching the area 
outside is illegal and does not count.</b>

11:05.860 --> 11:08.730
<b>Play will resume with Team Gon's 
outside players controlling the ball.</b>

11:11.060 --> 11:12.500
<b>Wow!</b>

11:12.500 --> 11:14.900
<b>He sent the biggest one flying.</b>

11:14.900 --> 11:15.860
<b>Damn it...</b>

11:16.280 --> 11:18.360
<b>That wasn't good enough!</b>

11:18.680 --> 11:20.920
<b>He looks unhappy...</b>

11:20.920 --> 11:22.470
<b>He's actually upset.</b>

11:23.940 --> 11:26.120
<b>That kid's really got guts.</b>

11:26.510 --> 11:27.710
<b><i>Not enough yet...</i></b>

11:28.830 --> 11:31.370
<b><i>Not enough to defeat the real Razor!</i></b>

11:33.210 --> 11:34.990
<b><i>I need more power!</i></b>

11:42.800 --> 11:45.180
<b>Okay, let's do it again.</b>

11:45.660 --> 11:47.590
<b>Give it to Razor good!</b>

11:51.620 --> 11:52.440
<b>Yeah.</b>

12:00.100 --> 12:02.080
<b><i>To beat Razor,</i></b>

12:02.080 --> 12:04.560
<b><i>I'll need a lot more power.</i></b>

12:32.730 --> 12:33.370
<b><i>Ren.</i></b>

12:39.020 --> 12:39.720
<b>What?</b>

12:40.630 --> 12:42.300
<b>His aura is immense.</b>

12:43.790 --> 12:46.120
<b>You may have chosen the wrong sport.</b>

12:46.660 --> 12:50.620
<b>He has all the time in the 
world to build up his power.</b>

12:51.020 --> 12:52.980
<b>You might want to dodge this one.</b>

12:56.130 --> 12:57.630
<b>You must be joking.</b>

13:01.330 --> 13:02.880
<b><i>Focus all the refined aura</i></b>

13:03.440 --> 13:05.130
<b><i>into my fist.</i></b>

13:06.920 --> 13:11.280
<b><i>First comes rock!</i></b>

13:28.980 --> 13:30.580
<b><i>Take this, Razor!</i></b>

13:31.580 --> 13:32.540
<b><i>Rock!</i></b>

13:34.040 --> 13:35.080
<b><i>Paper...</i></b>

13:36.590 --> 13:39.080
<b><i>Rock!</i></b>

13:45.820 --> 13:46.900
<b><i>Perfect!</i></b>

13:46.900 --> 13:48.050
<b><i>No way he'll catch that!</i></b>

13:55.330 --> 13:56.770
<b><i>He's receiving it?</i></b>

14:09.630 --> 14:12.660
<b><i>He used his own body to reduce its power.</i></b>

14:13.500 --> 14:14.450
<b><i>Nice move.</i></b>

14:14.830 --> 14:17.170
<b><i>That required perfect timing.</i></b>

14:17.170 --> 14:19.330
<b><i>But he was able to pull it off.</i></b>

14:22.330 --> 14:25.420
<b><i>This man truly is strong.</i></b>

14:33.240 --> 14:35.430
<b>Amazing...</b>

14:36.110 --> 14:38.610
<b>You can do more than just 
dodge or catch the ball.</b>

14:38.980 --> 14:41.940
<b>But I doubt that tip will help you.</b>

14:42.230 --> 14:45.630
<b>That ball was as strong as Razor's,</b>

14:45.630 --> 14:48.200
<b>but it didn't even reach the ceiling.</b>

14:48.710 --> 14:52.450
<b>He managed to burn off enough 
momentum with that receive.</b>

14:52.890 --> 14:54.660
<b>Now the ball's directly over him!</b>

14:58.280 --> 14:59.580
<b><i>Bungee gum.</i></b>

15:01.460 --> 15:02.710
<b>Too bad for you.</b>

15:03.360 --> 15:06.010
<b>You have to catch the ball, after all.</b>

15:07.130 --> 15:09.950
<b>As dictated by the cushion effect, Razor is out.</b>

15:09.950 --> 15:10.970
<b>Step to the outside.</b>

15:13.120 --> 15:14.360
<b>Back.</b>

15:15.960 --> 15:18.530
<b>Razor has used Back!</b>

15:19.230 --> 15:20.850
<b>He remains inside.</b>

15:20.850 --> 15:23.940
<b>Both teams have used Back, 
and it's three-on-two!</b>

15:23.940 --> 15:26.280
<b>The tables have turned!</b>

15:26.740 --> 15:27.810
<b>Really?</b>

15:28.740 --> 15:31.490
<b>Our team is the one on the ropes.</b>

15:33.050 --> 15:35.400
<b>Hisoka probably isn't in any shape to throw.</b>

15:35.770 --> 15:39.140
<b>No, he probably can't even hold 
the ball with his right hand.</b>

15:40.410 --> 15:43.200
<b>Gon's attacks used immense amounts of aura.</b>

15:43.620 --> 15:47.370
<b>He should be starting to feel tired about now.</b>

15:49.900 --> 15:54.340
<b>For him to be able to make another, 
equally strong throw is unlikely.</b>

15:54.760 --> 15:58.810
<b>So Killua is the only uninjured 
player left on the inside?</b>

15:59.140 --> 16:00.580
<b>No, you have it backwards.</b>

16:01.750 --> 16:06.290
<b>He's probably sustained the most damage of all.</b>

16:06.850 --> 16:07.880
<b>What do you mean?</b>

16:12.230 --> 16:13.930
<b>You okay, Gon?</b>

16:13.930 --> 16:18.230
<b>Yeah, but we need one more... I think.</b>

16:18.230 --> 16:19.790
<b>I'll put everything into this one.</b>

16:20.290 --> 16:20.910
<b>All right!</b>

16:21.450 --> 16:22.780
<b>This time, end it.</b>

16:23.940 --> 16:25.490
<b><i>One more throw...</i></b>

16:25.990 --> 16:27.040
<b><i>I can take it.</i></b>

16:27.500 --> 16:28.350
<b><i>Just hold out!</i></b>

16:29.840 --> 16:32.420
<b>When Gon launched his ball,</b>

16:32.420 --> 16:36.790
<b>Killua barely used any 
protective <i>Nen</i> on his hands.</b>

16:37.590 --> 16:38.800
<b>That's insane.</b>

16:38.800 --> 16:40.490
<b>You saw the power of that launch...</b>

16:40.490 --> 16:41.760
<b>Like a cannon opening fire!</b>

16:42.210 --> 16:43.270
<b>Correct.</b>

16:43.270 --> 16:48.540
<b>Essentially, he used his bare hands 
to form the cannon's barrel.</b>

16:49.130 --> 16:53.640
<b>Had Killua used a significant amount 
of <i>Nen</i> to protect his hands,</b>

16:54.970 --> 16:59.290
<b>his aura would have become a 
barrier against Gon's punch,</b>

16:59.290 --> 17:01.310
<b>reducing the power to the ball.</b>

17:02.180 --> 17:05.090
<b>In order to avoid weakening the ball,</b>

17:05.090 --> 17:09.550
<b>Killua used hardly any aura on his hands.</b>

17:11.270 --> 17:14.970
<b>Killua's hands must be in far worse shape</b>

17:14.970 --> 17:17.290
<b>than Hisoka's right hand.</b>

17:18.700 --> 17:21.120
<b><i>Damn... I'm a fool!</i></b>

17:21.510 --> 17:23.560
<b><i>How could I not be over there?</i></b>

17:24.100 --> 17:25.760
<b><i>I know the technique.</i></b>

17:25.760 --> 17:28.130
<b><i>And I can do it faster than Killua.</i></b>

17:29.110 --> 17:31.310
<b><i>In the instant before Gon touches the ball,</i></b>

17:31.310 --> 17:36.460
<b><i>you can apply a lightning-fast coat of 
aura to your hands for protection!</i></b>

17:37.620 --> 17:38.570
<b><i>Wait!</i></b>

17:39.240 --> 17:40.070
<b>Time out!</b>

17:40.070 --> 17:41.820
<b>Ref, I have a question.</b>

17:41.820 --> 17:43.040
<b>What is it?</b>

17:43.870 --> 17:48.250
<b>Can inside players choose 
to move to the outside?</b>

17:48.820 --> 17:51.120
<b>That doesn't violate any rules,</b>

17:51.120 --> 17:53.830
<b>but you can't return inside.</b>

17:54.100 --> 17:55.850
<b>Right... Come here!</b>

17:58.250 --> 18:02.720
<b>Gon, if you come outside, 
I can hold the ball for you.</b>

18:03.570 --> 18:06.290
<b>Killua's hands must be ravaged by now.</b>

18:06.630 --> 18:10.480
<b>I doubt he's in any condition 
to hold the ball for you.</b>

18:12.800 --> 18:16.530
<b>I know how to apply a lightning-fast coat of aura</b>

18:16.530 --> 18:19.110
<b>in order to protect my hands.</b>

18:19.110 --> 18:22.490
<b>I'll hold the ball, and you can 
take Razor out from here.</b>

18:23.450 --> 18:25.870
<b>It's our only way to win.</b>

18:26.200 --> 18:27.340
<b>We can't do that.</b>

18:27.340 --> 18:28.120
<b>Yeah.</b>

18:28.120 --> 18:29.930
<b>Wh-Why not?</b>

18:29.930 --> 18:31.420
<b>Where's the problem?</b>

18:31.420 --> 18:33.330
<b>It would be a cop-out.</b>

18:33.330 --> 18:34.280
<b>Huh?</b>

18:34.280 --> 18:36.880
<b>This isn't the time to worry about that!</b>

18:39.520 --> 18:41.380
<b>Don't overdo it, pops.</b>

18:41.380 --> 18:44.350
<b>You took a pretty big hit.</b>

18:44.350 --> 18:45.740
<b>I'm doing fine.</b>

18:45.740 --> 18:48.290
<b>I'm not hurting as much as you think.</b>

18:48.290 --> 18:50.260
<b>Then show me your hands.</b>

18:50.260 --> 18:51.610
<b>I'm all right.</b>

19:05.720 --> 19:06.630
<b>Look!</b>

19:06.630 --> 19:09.300
<b>He can't feel anything but pain.</b>

19:09.840 --> 19:11.040
<b>I can do this!</b>

19:11.410 --> 19:13.410
<b>I can take one more ball.</b>

19:13.870 --> 19:15.670
<b>Gon, I can do this!</b>

19:15.970 --> 19:17.040
<b>It's impossible!</b>

19:17.360 --> 19:19.660
<b>Gon, help me convince him.</b>

19:21.150 --> 19:23.520
<b>I already knew...</b>

19:24.760 --> 19:27.320
<b>I knew Killua's hands were messed up.</b>

19:28.800 --> 19:29.940
<b>Tsezgerra-san,</b>

19:29.940 --> 19:32.640
<b>I'm sorry, but I won't move outside.</b>

19:34.690 --> 19:37.000
<b>I need Killua to hold the ball.</b>

19:38.190 --> 19:40.120
<b>He's the only one who can do it!</b>

19:43.990 --> 19:48.260
<b>If Bisky or Hisoka held it, 
I probably couldn't use my full strength.</b>

19:48.940 --> 19:53.080
<b>The only reason I can focus 
wholly on hitting the ball</b>

19:54.150 --> 19:56.710
<b>is because Killua's holding it for me.</b>

20:03.800 --> 20:05.830
<b>So, got it now, pops?</b>

20:06.200 --> 20:07.690
<b>Go get some rest.</b>

20:07.990 --> 20:09.370
<b>I understand.</b>

20:10.760 --> 20:11.850
<b>I'm counting on you!</b>

20:14.740 --> 20:17.300
<b>Hisoka, give me the ball.</b>

20:17.300 --> 20:19.170
<b>We will now resume the match.</b>

20:22.580 --> 20:26.200
<b>Honestly, I'm not too good at throwing!</b>

20:31.000 --> 20:32.870
<b>Now we're even.</b>

20:33.750 --> 20:34.750
<b>Brilliant!</b>

20:34.750 --> 20:37.990
<b>She hit him at just the right angle 
so the ball would rebound to us.</b>

20:42.780 --> 20:44.380
<b>Number 2 is out!</b>

20:45.030 --> 20:46.510
<b>That leaves only...</b>

20:49.730 --> 20:50.980
<b>Razor alone!</b>

20:54.420 --> 20:58.020
<b>Gon, we need to regain 
the ball from Razor first.</b>

20:58.290 --> 20:59.350
<b>Of course.</b>

21:01.360 --> 21:02.270
<b>One sec.</b>

21:05.140 --> 21:07.540
<b>I understand. That sounds interesting.</b>

21:09.260 --> 21:11.470
<b>I'm not sure it'll work, though...</b>

21:11.470 --> 21:14.790
<b>Oh, but I would so love to try it.</b>

21:15.170 --> 21:17.070
<b>Let's give it a shot, Killua.</b>

21:17.520 --> 21:18.400
<b>Okay.</b>

21:18.860 --> 21:20.270
<b>Then it's settled.</b>

21:23.290 --> 21:27.700
<b>Man, you always come up 
with the craziest ideas.</b>

21:29.530 --> 21:31.080
<b>Counting on you, Killua.</b>

21:32.320 --> 21:34.650
<b>We will resume the match now.</b>

21:38.780 --> 21:43.780
<b>Gon and Killua share a strong bond of trust.</b>

21:44.480 --> 21:47.150
<b>What sort of team play will emerge</b>

21:47.540 --> 21:51.120
<b>when their friendship is backed 
by the addition of Hisoka?</b>

23:01.110 --> 23:08.150
