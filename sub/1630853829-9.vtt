00:14.414 --> 00:16.616
Good morning.

00:17.684 --> 00:19.420
Don't have much today.

00:19.453 --> 00:21.622
But I've got eggs, sausage,

00:21.655 --> 00:25.058
potatoes and pancakes.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.329
Hey, Postoak?

00:28.362 --> 00:31.131
There's a big mess
in the shitter and you're up.

00:31.164 --> 00:34.101

MRS. FIXICO:
Welcome back to the land
of the living, Bear.

01:08.735 --> 01:11.171
What'd I miss, bro?

01:11.204 --> 01:13.774
The whole class.
You talk in your sleep.

01:13.807 --> 01:15.643
- Talking about your hammer...
- Shh!

01:15.676 --> 01:17.311
No, I'm just tired
from work, bro.

01:17.344 --> 01:19.647
MRS. FIXICO:
Graduation is around the corner.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.248
You might remember
a little experiment

01:21.281 --> 01:22.483
from your freshman year.

01:22.516 --> 01:24.251
We asked you to write yourself

01:24.284 --> 01:26.453
a letter, talking about
your goals, your dreams.

01:26.486 --> 01:30.457
- Oh, I remember this shit.
- It's a letter from you to you.

01:30.490 --> 01:32.426
- Read them.
- Fuck yeah, man.

01:32.459 --> 01:33.727
Still a G.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.096
- Let me read yours.
- No.

01:37.497 --> 01:39.366
All right.

01:39.399 --> 01:42.503
"When I grow up,
I want to be a famous rapper.

01:42.536 --> 01:45.072
Just like my daddy." Aw!

01:45.105 --> 01:46.740
Yeah, you cannot say
anything, bro, look.

01:46.773 --> 01:49.243
"I want to be a wizard
when I grow up."

01:49.276 --> 01:51.478
Fuck you.
I still want to be a wizard.

01:53.413 --> 01:55.282
Sko, sko.

01:55.315 --> 01:57.351
Willie Jack, one second.

01:57.384 --> 01:58.652
Shit, what'd I do?

01:58.685 --> 02:00.254
You in trouble.

02:00.287 --> 02:03.156
All right, I'll see ya.
Deuces, bro.

02:07.628 --> 02:10.331
I'm sorry.

02:10.364 --> 02:12.333
This is Daniel's.

02:12.366 --> 02:14.601
You're his cousin,
I thought you should have it.

02:20.407 --> 02:22.142
Okay.

02:25.312 --> 02:27.147
Thank you.

02:39.626 --> 02:41.528
- Hey, what's up, girl?
- What's up?

02:41.561 --> 02:43.029
You're quiet today.

02:44.398 --> 02:46.600
It's one of them days.

02:46.633 --> 02:48.469
What kind of day is that?

02:48.502 --> 02:50.604
Same one.

02:50.637 --> 02:52.539
Over and over.

02:52.572 --> 02:53.741
Time! Line up!

02:53.774 --> 02:55.075
- Good shot.

02:55.108 --> 02:57.010
Thanks.

03:13.493 --> 03:15.528
Psst!

03:20.601 --> 03:22.403
: Fuck.

03:28.742 --> 03:31.412
Thought you were gone for good.

03:31.445 --> 03:33.113
Where'd you go?

03:33.146 --> 03:36.183
Somebody quit working
with their medicine.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.719
You know,
ignoring your responsibilities

03:38.752 --> 03:40.821
is ignoring your ancestors.

03:40.854 --> 03:43.324
And nobody likes to be ignored.

03:43.357 --> 03:45.492
Also...

03:45.525 --> 03:46.827
if you must know...

03:46.860 --> 03:48.762
I got me a grandpa spirit.

03:48.795 --> 03:50.364
He died at Little Bighorn.

03:50.397 --> 03:51.832
Spirit sex is way better.

03:51.865 --> 03:54.134
God, it lasts so much longer.

03:54.167 --> 03:55.236
Gross.

03:55.269 --> 03:57.137
Heylah, it's natural.

03:57.170 --> 03:59.506
Well, you can go back
to spirit hunchin'.

03:59.539 --> 04:01.075
- I don't need you here.
- Mm-mm.

04:01.108 --> 04:03.743
:
Today's the big day.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.580
Same as every other day.

04:06.613 --> 04:08.382
I don't think so.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.417
You felt it.

04:10.450 --> 04:11.652
Why else am I here?

04:11.685 --> 04:13.454
You tuned in today.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.556
I didn't mean to.

04:15.589 --> 04:18.292
Can I tune back out?

04:18.325 --> 04:19.760
No.

04:19.793 --> 04:22.696
We got a lot of eyes
on this place today.

04:22.729 --> 04:24.265
:
Spirits.

04:24.298 --> 04:27.033
They like to watch.

04:32.439 --> 04:35.376
Spirits.

04:35.409 --> 04:37.744
Freaks.

04:41.248 --> 04:42.549
Hokti.

04:42.582 --> 04:44.518
You got a visitor.

04:44.551 --> 04:47.054
Name not on the list.

04:47.087 --> 04:48.822

04:52.125 --> 04:55.629

Are you a convicted felon?

05:24.257 --> 05:25.759

06:00.160 --> 06:02.730
Hey, hey.

06:02.763 --> 06:06.066
I did a hero dose
of mushrooms once.

06:06.099 --> 06:08.569
Fucked me up.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.504
Spent the night in jail,
naked as a jaybird.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.706
I think I saw God.

06:15.108 --> 06:16.410
Cool.

06:16.443 --> 06:19.179
It wasn't that cool.
It was a jail just like this.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.348
You know why we built jails,
don't you?

06:21.381 --> 06:23.617
Who?

06:23.650 --> 06:25.419
Well, white people of course.

06:25.452 --> 06:27.388
Indians didn't have jails.

06:27.421 --> 06:29.256
Word, no shit?

06:29.289 --> 06:31.458
No shit,
the people that built this

06:31.491 --> 06:33.494
had lost their way.

06:33.527 --> 06:36.130
You remember that.

06:36.163 --> 06:37.797
Okay, then.

06:42.436 --> 06:45.306
Being separated
from your family's a bitch.

06:45.339 --> 06:46.674
It ain't natural.

06:46.707 --> 06:49.643
I come here to see my daughter.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.514
Word.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.382
That's why I'm here.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.151
To see my family.

06:57.184 --> 07:00.054
They may not know it,
they may not want it,

07:00.087 --> 07:02.623
but you're coming here
to visit them

07:02.656 --> 07:05.125
is the most important thing
you can do

07:05.158 --> 07:07.427
to somebody that's locked up
in a place like this.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.734
I don't know
why I'm here, man.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.369
I haven't been happy with her.

07:18.238 --> 07:21.075
Just feels like
I needed to do something.

07:21.108 --> 07:24.078
- So I'm doing it.
- Well, that's a risk.

07:24.111 --> 07:27.080
But you're listening
to your heart, that's good.

07:29.316 --> 07:31.385
Are you a guru?

07:31.418 --> 07:33.320
Or a philosopher or something?

07:33.353 --> 07:35.589
Nah, I'm not a philosopher.

07:35.622 --> 07:38.325
I'm just an old hippie dude
that's done a lot of acid.

07:38.358 --> 07:40.227
It makes you think.

07:40.260 --> 07:43.297
When you're my age,
there's a lot to think about.

07:43.330 --> 07:45.099
I live by a few rules.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.601
Be kind to those
that you're closest to.

07:47.634 --> 07:51.272
Wear a good hat
and a good pair of boots.

07:51.305 --> 07:53.207
A good hat helps hide
what you're doing

07:53.240 --> 07:55.576
from the Lord above,
and good boots,

07:55.609 --> 07:58.245
they help you outrun the Devil.

07:58.278 --> 07:59.680
Slides work?

07:59.713 --> 08:02.449
- Oh, fuck yeah.
- All right.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.628
- Wilhelmina Jacqueline?

08:14.661 --> 08:17.063
Oh...

08:20.601 --> 08:23.203
Toes behind the yellow line.

08:23.236 --> 08:24.571
Arms up.

08:37.384 --> 08:38.686
All right.

08:38.719 --> 08:41.088
- You know the rules?
- No.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.757
You're allowed
two small moments of contact.

08:43.790 --> 08:46.493
You can hug or a small kiss
on the cheek or both.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.562
You are only allowed to do this
at the beginning of your visit

08:48.595 --> 08:51.098
and at the end. Two moments.

08:51.131 --> 08:53.767
- Got it?
- Could you repeat that again?

08:55.302 --> 08:56.736
Just kidding.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.344
Why is everyone so serious?

09:05.679 --> 09:07.615
It's in the past.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.092
Hands.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.360
So...

09:55.329 --> 09:57.631
How you doing?

09:57.664 --> 09:59.733
Are you shitting me?

10:04.771 --> 10:08.208
Well, everyone's
doing good at home.

10:08.241 --> 10:10.544
Um...

10:10.577 --> 10:12.345
Mom and Dad say hi.

10:14.548 --> 10:16.216
Just kidding,
they didn't say that.

10:16.249 --> 10:19.452
My dad tried convincing me
not to come here.

10:20.654 --> 10:22.389
They have no clue
that I'm here though.

10:24.725 --> 10:27.093
Me and Bear are gonna
graduate this year.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.065
Yeah, Daniel would've been
right with us.

10:33.266 --> 10:35.735
But you knew that.

10:38.705 --> 10:40.274
Cheese moved in
with some old lady.

10:40.307 --> 10:41.508
Can I get some paper?

10:45.779 --> 10:47.248
- Just paper, that's it?
- Yeah.

10:47.281 --> 10:49.049
You gonna take
some notes or what?

10:55.656 --> 10:58.225
There's no smoking in here.

11:02.296 --> 11:05.365
So I'm just going
through the motions.

11:06.600 --> 11:08.568
Helps with stress.

11:15.108 --> 11:17.611
So what's this
about Cheese dating an old lady?

11:17.644 --> 11:19.480
Fuck you mean,
"dating an old lady"?

11:19.513 --> 11:21.749
I didn't say that.

11:21.782 --> 11:23.651
Well...

11:23.684 --> 11:26.086
she thought she was his grandma,

11:26.119 --> 11:29.390
but turned out that she wasn't.

11:29.423 --> 11:31.558
Then...

11:31.591 --> 11:35.229
now she became his grandma.

11:35.262 --> 11:37.831
Not the weirdest thing
I've ever heard.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.767
Mm-hmm.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.069
Elora's grandma Mabel died.

11:42.102 --> 11:44.672
You know what,
I'm all caught up.

11:44.705 --> 11:45.806
If my truth smells like dick,

11:45.839 --> 11:47.741
your truth smells like slore.

11:47.774 --> 11:49.510
What the fuck even is that?

11:49.543 --> 11:50.744
That's a slut/whore mix.

11:50.777 --> 11:51.545
Hey, you want me
to use it in a sentence?

11:51.578 --> 11:54.348
Your mother is a slore.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.750
Okay, everyone,
hands on the table, palms up.

11:56.783 --> 11:58.752
Till we get
this matter resolved.

11:58.785 --> 12:01.388
- Let's go, buddy.
- Hey, try not to have
any more secret kids!

12:01.421 --> 12:03.490
Well, guess what, we're still
married, they're your kids, too!

12:03.523 --> 12:06.093
- Hey, that don't make any sense!
- They need a mom!

12:06.126 --> 12:08.095
Asshole!

12:08.128 --> 12:09.563
Hey, you're
all a bunch of slores!

12:09.596 --> 12:11.531
- She's the best.
- Fuck you!

12:12.699 --> 12:14.501
You may resume your visitation.

12:27.147 --> 12:29.049
Why are you here?

12:40.427 --> 12:43.831
This is a letter Daniel wrote
to himself in freshman year.

12:43.864 --> 12:47.101
Um, time capsule assignment.

12:47.134 --> 12:49.569
All his dreams and shit.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.340
I think you should have it.

12:53.373 --> 12:56.277
I don't want it.

12:56.310 --> 12:57.645
Well...

12:57.678 --> 12:59.613
what if I read it to you?

12:59.646 --> 13:02.683
I haven't read it yet.

13:02.716 --> 13:05.252
It could probably help us,
be like healing...

13:05.285 --> 13:07.087
I said no.

13:09.423 --> 13:11.791
Shit like this is why none
of you are on my visitors list.

13:13.260 --> 13:15.795
I look at you and I see him,
you understand?

13:20.400 --> 13:22.702
Yeah. I do.

13:24.171 --> 13:27.207
But you're not the only one
that's affected by this.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.476
No one's the same.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.511
I miss my friends.

13:33.580 --> 13:36.350
And I miss you, too.

13:36.383 --> 13:39.753
Like the version I remember
of you when I was little.

13:41.388 --> 13:43.490
Remember I used
to always come to you

13:43.523 --> 13:45.526
whenever I'd get hurt?

13:45.559 --> 13:47.227
Which was rare.

13:48.428 --> 13:51.432
I always remember
you made things better.

13:51.465 --> 13:53.600
Daniel was the same way.

13:56.803 --> 13:59.206
I used to think
you were so powerful.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.742
Like a wizard.

14:01.775 --> 14:04.044
But now...

14:07.247 --> 14:09.749
...you'd rather be
fucking miserable, man.

14:12.119 --> 14:14.755
All you elders
don't even want to talk to me.

14:14.788 --> 14:17.391
Avoiding shit
all the fucking time.

14:17.424 --> 14:21.061
No wonder why my mom and dad
didn't want me to come here.

14:28.135 --> 14:30.104
Fuck me. Fine.

14:31.705 --> 14:32.673
You know, when you ask
someone for advice,

14:32.706 --> 14:34.275
you should bring a gift.

14:34.308 --> 14:36.510
Tobacco, sweetgrass,

14:36.543 --> 14:38.479
cedar, anything works.

14:38.512 --> 14:40.414
Food's best.

14:40.447 --> 14:44.551
People are a lot more open
when they have food.

14:44.584 --> 14:47.221
They won't let me
take food in here, fuck.

14:47.254 --> 14:48.622
They'll just think I'm trying
to hustle some shit.

14:48.655 --> 14:49.823
How much cash you got?

14:49.856 --> 14:51.492
I got ten bucks up my sock.

14:51.525 --> 14:53.727
Well.

14:57.264 --> 15:00.367
I'm real addicted to them
Flaming Flamers.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.335
Me, too.

15:01.368 --> 15:04.471
Well... sko then.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.649
You gonna just keep looking over
my shoulder this whole time?

15:15.682 --> 15:18.519
Smiling all creepy.

15:18.552 --> 15:20.387
Acting all happy.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.555
Your vibe sucks.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.757
I walked the Trail of Tears

15:23.790 --> 15:25.359
and I smiled more than you.

15:56.290 --> 15:58.058
Mmm.

16:18.378 --> 16:20.214
Come on then.

16:20.247 --> 16:22.048
Tell me what's wrong.

16:23.784 --> 16:25.686
Brought me the offerings.

16:25.719 --> 16:27.754
Sko.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.760
Well...

16:32.793 --> 16:35.262
Bear and Elora
don't talk anymore.

16:35.295 --> 16:37.398
Well...

16:37.431 --> 16:40.167
we hang out, but...

16:40.200 --> 16:43.070
it's like they're just
trying to be polite.

16:43.103 --> 16:45.606
Cheese is always with
his new grandma all the time.

16:45.639 --> 16:48.041
Which is good.

16:49.409 --> 16:51.078
I don't know, man.

16:51.111 --> 16:52.746
It's like...

16:52.779 --> 16:55.081
I just feel
like we're broken up.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.819
And like...

16:58.852 --> 17:01.488
we're supposed
to be the dream team.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.757
Fucking Rez Dogs.

17:05.459 --> 17:07.528
Friends grow apart.

17:07.561 --> 17:09.530
This ain't like that.

17:09.563 --> 17:12.532
It's like everyone's walking
around in the sunshine.

17:13.667 --> 17:16.070
And we're just in the darkness.

17:17.404 --> 17:19.706
Bear and Elora especially.

17:39.126 --> 17:40.361
Come on.

17:40.394 --> 17:42.396
Put your hands up on the table.

17:42.429 --> 17:44.531
Like we just did.

17:46.133 --> 17:47.401
Close your eyes.

17:47.434 --> 17:50.770
- Gonna have a little prayer.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.081
:
I need your help.

18:02.115 --> 18:04.217
- What?
- Not you. Keep your eyes shut.

18:05.152 --> 18:07.721
Eyes closed,
no matter what happens, okay?

18:08.855 --> 18:12.359
- Just focus on the dark.

18:16.563 --> 18:19.767
Take long, slow breaths.

18:24.237 --> 18:27.207
Good.

18:27.240 --> 18:30.210
Just listen to your breathing
for a second.

18:31.411 --> 18:35.282
Remember the stories I told you
when you were growing up,

18:35.315 --> 18:38.084
about the people we come from.

18:40.854 --> 18:43.223
Generations of medicine people.

18:45.659 --> 18:48.094
Caretakers.

18:50.564 --> 18:53.434
These are the ones...

18:53.467 --> 18:56.804
who held us together as
we arrived from our homelands.

19:01.541 --> 19:07.080
The healers who carried us
and buried us as we marched.

19:08.315 --> 19:12.352
Men and women whose songs
led us through the dark.

19:13.387 --> 19:16.523
They're watching you, my girl.

19:19.526 --> 19:23.096
You don't need me.
You have them.

19:29.369 --> 19:32.706
This is the power we carry.

19:35.242 --> 19:40.347
When you really pray,
they're all around you.

19:40.380 --> 19:43.049
All the time.

19:44.718 --> 19:48.255
Oh, shit.

19:54.261 --> 19:57.231
Takes focus, though.

19:57.264 --> 19:59.233
Intent.

20:06.506 --> 20:08.676
Open your eyes.

20:12.646 --> 20:16.116
- Holy fuck.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.826
Oh, shit.

20:25.859 --> 20:27.627
Ah, fuck.

20:37.371 --> 20:41.074
I spent a lot of energy
trying to fix Danny.

20:43.510 --> 20:45.346
Instead, I took on his pain.

20:45.379 --> 20:48.048
We shared it.

20:49.149 --> 20:52.519
Can't love someone out of
hurting themselves, though.

20:54.288 --> 20:56.490
I was so focused on Danny,

20:56.523 --> 21:00.527
so focused on myself that...

21:00.560 --> 21:02.062
:
I couldn't see...

21:07.534 --> 21:10.036
You can't help people
who don't want to be helped.

21:11.238 --> 21:15.075
- I learned that the hard way.

21:15.108 --> 21:18.212
You create the space
for your friends.

21:18.245 --> 21:20.780
You do it with intention.

21:23.150 --> 21:26.353
Either the path will be
laid for you, or won't.

21:26.386 --> 21:30.224
I know they want to be helped,

21:30.257 --> 21:33.494
but I don't know
how to bring them together.

21:33.527 --> 21:35.629
Christ, girl.

21:35.662 --> 21:38.064
Weren't you paying attention?

21:40.133 --> 21:41.602
The answer's
right in front of you.

21:44.171 --> 21:46.073
Hey.

21:46.106 --> 21:48.108
Come here.

21:56.650 --> 21:58.084
Okay, that's enough.

22:02.255 --> 22:03.390
I'm ready.

22:03.423 --> 22:05.759
You take that letter with you.

22:07.427 --> 22:09.563
Found its way to you, not me.

22:15.235 --> 22:17.338
It was good to see you, granddaughter...

22:17.371 --> 22:20.607
niece... cousin.

22:33.253 --> 22:35.055
Did you invite Bear
and Elora, too?

22:35.088 --> 22:36.223
- Yeah. Fuck.

22:36.256 --> 22:38.024
Can't let these wild onions
go to waste.

22:41.628 --> 22:44.331
Where'd you get these from?

22:44.364 --> 22:46.500
Mm, my mom and dad picked them
earlier this year.

22:46.533 --> 22:49.436
- Hmm.
- Froze them, bro.

22:49.469 --> 22:51.338
It smells like a locker room.

22:51.371 --> 22:53.374
I mean, a good locker room.
Locker room I'd like to eat.

22:53.407 --> 22:55.643
- Not-not-- I mean...
- Yeah, yeah. Cook that shit, bro.

22:59.346 --> 23:01.047
Am I early?

23:02.249 --> 23:04.084
Fuck no. Just in time.

23:06.119 --> 23:07.388
What is this?

23:07.421 --> 23:09.689
Potato salad.

23:13.627 --> 23:15.663
- Sup, Bear?

23:15.696 --> 23:17.665
What'd you cook?
Oh, potato chips.

23:17.698 --> 23:20.601
We've all brought potatoes
of all kinds.

23:20.634 --> 23:22.702
Sit down, bro. Almost done.

23:28.342 --> 23:30.343
Sup, Bear?

23:31.478 --> 23:33.046
What's up, Elora?

23:44.224 --> 23:46.059
Why are we here?

24:16.623 --> 24:19.059
Well, this has been fun.

24:25.632 --> 24:28.034
I went and saw Hokti.

24:29.069 --> 24:30.303
Whoa.

24:31.271 --> 24:32.472
In jail?

24:34.341 --> 24:36.343
Yep.

24:37.511 --> 24:39.346
How is she?

24:39.379 --> 24:41.649
She's good.

24:41.682 --> 24:43.583
Looks all healthy and shit.

24:45.218 --> 24:46.686
Smoking paper cigs.

24:51.525 --> 24:54.361
I went to go talk to her because...

24:54.394 --> 24:58.198
I needed some advice about...

24:58.231 --> 25:00.033
all of us.

25:01.602 --> 25:03.737
What about us?

25:03.770 --> 25:05.306
You know what I'm talking about, bro.

25:05.339 --> 25:07.074
This is weird.

25:07.107 --> 25:10.177
We barely talk
or see each other anymore.

25:10.210 --> 25:12.613
Man, everything is fine.

25:12.646 --> 25:16.250
Yeah. Everything's totally fine.

25:16.283 --> 25:17.484
Yeah.

25:20.554 --> 25:22.422
Wow, that was convincing.

25:27.394 --> 25:29.429
Wait, I'm-a try something.

25:31.765 --> 25:34.602
Give me your hands, uh, face up.

25:34.635 --> 25:36.536
Hokti taught me this.

25:44.111 --> 25:45.346
Fuck you doing?

25:45.379 --> 25:47.081
You said face up.

25:47.114 --> 25:48.014
Palms up.

25:50.484 --> 25:54.722
I have the power
invested in me...

25:54.755 --> 26:00.261
by the freaking
generational ghosts behind me.

26:00.294 --> 26:02.196
:
Like Rey in <i>Star Wars.</i>

26:02.229 --> 26:03.730
- Cheese.
- Sorry.

26:07.367 --> 26:09.570
:
You guys feel anything yet?

26:09.603 --> 26:11.205
- Mm-mm.

26:11.238 --> 26:13.374
- Are we supposed to?
- My stomach hurts.

26:13.407 --> 26:14.775
A fly keeps landing on me.

26:14.808 --> 26:16.577
I feel a light breeze.

26:16.610 --> 26:18.478
:
Fuck.

26:21.281 --> 26:24.351
Look, I appreciate
what you're doing, but...

26:24.384 --> 26:26.086
we're all good.

26:26.119 --> 26:28.255
Yeah, man. You ain't got
to worry about us.

26:28.288 --> 26:30.023
We're fine.

26:54.514 --> 26:56.449
Daniel wrote this.

26:59.386 --> 27:00.354
What-what is it?

27:00.387 --> 27:01.789
Freshman year,

27:01.822 --> 27:04.358
uh, we did
a time capsule assignment.

27:04.391 --> 27:05.726
Mm-hmm.

27:05.759 --> 27:07.661
Teacher just
gave me back Daniel's.

27:07.694 --> 27:10.598
And this is
all his dreams and goals.

27:10.631 --> 27:12.099
I haven't read it yet,

27:12.132 --> 27:14.301
but I wanted to read it

You serious?

28:17.364 --> 28:19.366
For Daniel.

28:19.399 --> 28:21.035
Because he can't.

And if you guys still
want to be weird,

28:24.771 --> 28:27.474
