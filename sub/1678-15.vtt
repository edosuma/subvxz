<i>OLDER TED; Kids, something you</i>
<i>might not know about your Uncle Marshall</i>

00:08.274 --> 00:10.401
<i>is that he's always been good at games,</i>

00:10.510 --> 00:11.841
<i>I mean unbeatable,</i>

00:11.945 --> 00:13.003
Gin!

00:15.081 --> 00:16.309
Yahtzee!

00:17.517 --> 00:18.643
Poker!

00:19.452 --> 00:21.647
You don't have to shout out "poker"
when you win.

00:21.755 --> 00:23.620
I know. It's just fun to say.

00:24.190 --> 00:25.282
<i>OLDER TED; We all finally agreed,</i>

00:25.392 --> 00:27.155
<i>Marshall should be</i>
<i>running our game nights,</i>

00:27.260 --> 00:28.522
<i>instead of playing in them,</i>

00:28.628 --> 00:31.620
<i>Which he took to mean,</i>
<i>"Invent your own game,"</i>

00:31.831 --> 00:34.391
It's called "Marshgammon."

00:34.868 --> 00:37.496
It combines all the best features
of all the best games,

00:37.604 --> 00:39.799
Candyland, I Never, Pictionary.

00:39.906 --> 00:41.498
- Backgammon, obviously.
- No.

00:41.608 --> 00:43.132
Backgammon sucks.

00:43.243 --> 00:45.643
I took the only good part of
"backgammon," the "gammon,"

00:45.745 --> 00:49.237
and I left the rest of it in the trash
where it belongs.

00:49.616 --> 00:51.982
I'm so excited Victoria's coming.

00:52.085 --> 00:53.916
I'm gonna go get another round.

00:54.020 --> 00:56.614
Okay. I wanna lay down
some ground rules for tonight, Barney.

00:56.723 --> 00:59.419
I actually like Victoria a lot.

00:59.526 --> 01:02.757
So, don't say anything...
Don't say anything.

01:03.530 --> 01:06.431
And, guys, I haven't exactly told Victoria

01:06.533 --> 01:08.501
that I used to have
a kind of thing for Robin,

01:08.601 --> 01:12.867
- so if we could just avoid the...
- Well, well, well, how rich.

01:13.373 --> 01:16.638
You make me promise to be on
my best behavior around your girlfriend,

01:16.743 --> 01:19.644
yet you have been lying to her
since day one.

01:20.046 --> 01:21.343
Excuse me.

01:22.148 --> 01:23.274
Hi, Leg Warehouse?

01:23.383 --> 01:25.874
Yeah, my friend Ted
needs something to stand on.

01:25.985 --> 01:29.421
So, nothing for him to stand on?
Okay, thanks so much.

01:30.356 --> 01:34.850
Ted, doesn't Victoria deserve to know
that you once had the hots for Robin?

01:35.528 --> 01:39.055
I have half a mind
to tell the story of the re-return.

01:39.732 --> 01:42.257
(WHISPERING) No,
I swore you to secrecy on that.

01:42.368 --> 01:46.099
I am smelling dirt.
What is the story of the re-return?

01:46.206 --> 01:47.867
Nothing. It's nothing.

01:47.974 --> 01:49.532
And, speaking of digging up dirt,

01:49.642 --> 01:51.906
can I count on you two
to behave around Victoria?

01:52.011 --> 01:54.070
Us? What would we do?

01:54.447 --> 01:57.883
Look, you guys have always been
like the parents that I still have,

01:57.984 --> 02:00.009
and, in fact, moved here to get away from.

02:00.120 --> 02:03.180
However, could we skip
the traditional interrogation

02:03.289 --> 02:05.519
of the new girlfriend tonight?

02:05.625 --> 02:06.819
- Fine.
- Fine.

02:06.926 --> 02:07.984
Thank you.

02:08.094 --> 02:10.619
- I should go help Robin.
- Okay.

02:12.699 --> 02:14.064
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:14.334 --> 02:17.701
So, you gonna be okay
hanging out with Victoria tonight?

02:17.804 --> 02:19.635
Oh, sure. She's great.

02:20.406 --> 02:22.966
Oh, what? Because of the whole thing
where I said I liked Ted?

02:23.076 --> 02:24.703
No. Victoria is great.

02:24.811 --> 02:27.712
She's fun, she's free-spirited. She's great.

02:28.248 --> 02:30.216
I said "She's great" too many times,
didn't I?

02:30.316 --> 02:32.580
You must really hate the bitch.

02:33.586 --> 02:37.579
But if you roll an even number
while adjacent to the Peppermint Forest,

02:37.690 --> 02:40.818
then you "Marshall Out,"
and all your chips go into the pot.

02:40.927 --> 02:44.761
And remember,
if you ever ask the question, "What,"

02:44.864 --> 02:47.059
then you gotta drink.

02:47.734 --> 02:48.701
Got it?

02:48.801 --> 02:51.099
- No idea what you're talking about.
- No idea what you're talking about.

02:51.204 --> 02:52.228
Okay, okay. All right, no, no.

02:52.338 --> 02:54.670
We'll just start. You guys will pick it up.
Newbie goes first.

02:54.774 --> 02:56.139
- MARSHALL: Roll.
- Okay.

02:57.277 --> 03:00.542
Three! You got "Autobiography."

03:00.647 --> 03:04.208
Now, that's where you have to answer
a personal question about your dating life,

03:04.317 --> 03:06.114
truthfully, in order to move on.

03:06.219 --> 03:09.882
- Marshall, come on.
- Hey. She's the one who rolled a three.

03:11.658 --> 03:12.955
Victoria.

03:13.059 --> 03:16.392
"Have you ever cheated
while in a relationship?"

03:16.496 --> 03:18.225
Wow, good question.

03:18.331 --> 03:20.799
- You don't have to answer that.
- It's okay.

03:21.701 --> 03:25.398
Well, I was in a really crappy relationship
in college,

03:25.505 --> 03:29.168
and I wound up kissing this guy
at a party one night

03:29.275 --> 03:33.075
and I felt terrible about it,
so I came clean and we broke up.

03:35.215 --> 03:38.412
Victoria, that was an honest
and mature answer.

03:38.518 --> 03:40.952
You may advance
to the Gumdrop Mountains.

03:42.422 --> 03:46.017
So, Victoria,
did you ever re-return to this guy?

03:46.125 --> 03:48.719
- What?
- You said what. You gotta drink.

03:50.563 --> 03:54.499
Oh, Barney, by the way, I went to a party
in that new building on 82nd,

03:54.601 --> 03:56.193
and the host said she knew you.

03:56.302 --> 03:59.362
- What is her name? Sharon? Shannon?
- Shannon?

04:00.373 --> 04:02.000
Shannon, Shannon.

04:02.508 --> 04:04.806
No. Don't remember any Shannon.

04:05.044 --> 04:07.672
Really? Well, 'cause she gave me
a videotape to give you.

04:07.780 --> 04:09.407
Where's the tape?

04:12.018 --> 04:13.383
I'll get it.

04:13.486 --> 04:15.784
Cool. Okay. You know, whenever.

04:15.955 --> 04:18.355
Okay, Robin. Your roll.

04:20.692 --> 04:23.958
Five! Another "Autobiography."

04:24.664 --> 04:28.395
For the player to your left which...
Victoria!

04:28.501 --> 04:29.991
Of course.

04:30.403 --> 04:31.631
Victoria.

04:32.105 --> 04:36.439
"How many boyfriends did you have
before you started dating Ted?"

04:36.542 --> 04:38.339
Wait, the card actually says Ted?

04:38.444 --> 04:42.278
Okay. Well, boyfriends,
I guess I've only had two.

04:42.382 --> 04:43.781

04:44.751 --> 04:49.188

I've dated other guys in between.

- Damn it!

and hidden the real tape in my purse.

- Drink.

05:29.696 --> 05:34.633
Yeah, you were acting so weird about it
I gave you Ted's graduation tape instead.

- Give it to me.

11:53.345 --> 11:55.905
- Oh, I don't know, guys.
- Okay, okay.

11:56.649 --> 11:59.447
- Marshall's mom sent us cookies.
- Lily, no! No, Lily!

11:59.552 --> 12:02.214
For the team, Marshall, for the team.

12:02.788 --> 12:04.949
Hey, Mrs. Eriksen, it's Lily.

12:05.057 --> 12:07.958
Thank you so much
for the delicious cookies.

12:08.794 --> 12:10.489
Mayonnaise. Really?

12:11.263 --> 12:12.958
Never would have guessed.

12:13.065 --> 12:16.125
Yes, well I will definitely give Marshall
a kiss for you.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.668
Okay, take care.

12:17.770 --> 12:21.137
- Hi, baby.
- Oh, crap! My mom sent cookies?

12:21.674 --> 12:25.508
Yeah. I wish we had a dog,
so they wouldn't go to waste.

12:25.611 --> 12:26.635
Yeah.

12:27.012 --> 12:29.378
So, we've got the whole place
to ourselves.

12:29.482 --> 12:33.350
- I'm thinking floor sex.
- Sounds reasonable.

12:35.621 --> 12:37.248

12:44.697 --> 12:47.860

12:49.135 --> 12:51.467
Barney, that was really embarrassing
for both of us.

12:51.570 --> 12:53.834
We just earned a huge chunk of story.

12:53.939 --> 12:55.964
Right. So where was I?

12:56.442 --> 12:59.138
Oh, yeah.
Shannon was sucking face with her dad.

13:08.053 --> 13:10.419
How could... With your dad?

13:10.523 --> 13:15.085
I mean, I know,
judge not lest ye be judged, but gross!

13:15.194 --> 13:17.287
Barney, that's not my dad.

13:17.396 --> 13:19.728
His name's Greg.
I've been seeing him for a few weeks.

13:19.832 --> 13:23.427
I was hoping you'd just leave
and we could avoid all this.

13:24.236 --> 13:27.364
We're breaking up?
But what about the Peace Corps?

13:27.473 --> 13:30.806
Yeah, all this granola business,
it was just a phase.

13:31.410 --> 13:34.243
Greg's older. He's successful.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.911
He buys me all this cool stuff.

13:38.250 --> 13:41.549
- But I love you.
- But he has a boat.

13:43.489 --> 13:47.448
You should go to the Peace Corps.
And forget about me.

The story's not over.
I did see Shannon one more time.

15:49.748 --> 15:52.080
- When?
- Sorry. Sorry.

15:54.253 --> 15:56.221
Oh, you've gotta tell us.

15:56.388 --> 16:00.882
I don't know. I think I might need
one last story to get me through it.

Fine.

Oh, the Green Testicles story.

16:06.465 --> 16:08.490
So, I was playing Ultimate Frisbee
in college,

16:08.600 --> 16:11.068
and there was this barefoot dude
with a weirdly sharp toenail...

16:11.170 --> 16:14.401
Oh, come on, Ted!
You know what story I wanna hear.

16:14.773 --> 16:17.708
Everyone else here has manned-up tonight

You're right.

told you this yet, but a while back,

16:26.418 --> 16:29.216
I was kind of into Robin.

16:30.422 --> 16:34.449
In fact, on our first date,
I might've said, "I love you."

16:36.095 --> 16:39.064
Understandably, she freaked out,
and I left,

- Barney?
- Hi, Shannon.

- What are you doing here?
- Just listen.

When you left me for that guy Greg,
it changed me.

Now, I'm this.

18:51.063 --> 18:54.760
I know this is crazy, it's just,
you were once such a big part of my life,

18:54.867 --> 18:57.335
and it just seemed insane
that you didn't know who I am now.

18:57.436 --> 18:59.768
So, here I am.

19:01.773 --> 19:03.604
<i>BARNEY; And then she told me</i>
<i>about her life,</i>

19:03.842 --> 19:07.039
She and Greg dated for a while,
and then split up.

19:07.479 --> 19:10.380
But here's the real kicker.
Shannon's a mom.

19:11.049 --> 19:13.347
She has a little kid named Max.

19:13.519 --> 19:17.046
That's crazy. That could've been my kid.

19:18.390 --> 19:20.517
But instead, what do I have?

19:20.926 --> 19:24.123
My whole life's some money in the bank,
some suits in my closet,

19:24.229 --> 19:26.959
and a string of one-night stands.

19:28.233 --> 19:30.133
Hey, come on.

19:30.235 --> 19:32.032
I mean, just because her life
went one way,

19:32.137 --> 19:35.937
and yours went another,
doesn't make your life any worse.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.333
My life rocks!

19:40.913 --> 19:44.178
Money, suits and sex.
These are tears of joy.
