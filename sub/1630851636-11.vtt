WEBVTT

00:04.004 --> 00:05.309
<i>Previously on</i> Bull...

00:05.396 --> 00:06.354
I'm considering leaving TAC

00:06.441 --> 00:07.355
and going to work

00:07.442 --> 00:08.443
<i>for Bradley Lena.</i>

00:08.530 --> 00:09.487
You're leaving?

00:09.618 --> 00:10.662
Goodbye.

00:10.749 --> 00:12.360
I can make you a full partner.

00:12.447 --> 00:14.536
No. You're too late, Bull.

00:14.623 --> 00:15.667
I'm happy where I am.

00:15.798 --> 00:18.148
Ms. Rentzel?

00:18.235 --> 00:19.454
I'm Special Agent Delgado.

00:19.541 --> 00:20.846
You recently met a young woman

00:20.977 --> 00:22.239
by the name of Zola Macer,

00:22.326 --> 00:24.154
<i>a hacker, goes by "Tidal."</i>

00:24.198 --> 00:25.329
You're asking if my son

00:25.416 --> 00:26.765
can move to Hawaii?

00:26.852 --> 00:27.897
I thought we could
at least discuss it.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.290
There's nothing to discuss.

00:29.333 --> 00:30.552
I'm not living clear
across the country

00:30.639 --> 00:32.032
from my six-year-old son.

00:32.075 --> 00:33.337
I got a call
from the attorney

00:33.424 --> 00:34.860
representing Erik Rentzel.

00:34.991 --> 00:36.079
Being in the middle of

00:36.166 --> 00:37.646
a criminal investigation

00:37.733 --> 00:38.951
isn't gonna play well
in family court.

00:39.039 --> 00:42.085
Erik is suing me
for custody of Mauricio?

00:50.224 --> 00:51.747
Can you believe this?

00:51.877 --> 00:53.662
This is crazy.

00:53.749 --> 00:54.706
But I wouldn't say no
to some overtime.

00:54.837 --> 00:55.707
Yeah.

00:55.838 --> 00:57.535
Oh. Heads up.

00:57.622 --> 00:58.493
The boss is here.

00:58.623 --> 01:00.190
Hey!

01:00.234 --> 01:01.931
Can someone tell me
what the hell I'm doing here

01:02.018 --> 01:03.933
at 10:00 a.m. and not
a damn thing's getting done?

01:04.064 --> 01:05.630
I'm sorry, Mr. Krenell, but...

01:05.717 --> 01:06.892
You know how much
this is costing me?

01:06.979 --> 01:09.156
I know. It's just
we got a situation.

01:09.199 --> 01:11.636
He said his name is
"Dimitri Gillard" or something.

01:11.723 --> 01:13.682
Apparently,
- he owns the place.
- Owned.

01:13.769 --> 01:14.770
I'll handle it.

01:14.857 --> 01:16.946
Sir,

01:17.033 --> 01:18.382
we're gonna need
you to leave.

01:18.469 --> 01:20.254
No.

01:20.297 --> 01:23.996
I understand how difficult
this must be for you,

01:24.084 --> 01:25.824
but everything's been decided.

01:25.911 --> 01:27.217
All the checks
have been sent out.

01:27.304 --> 01:28.740
I'm sure you got
yours, right?

01:28.827 --> 01:32.092
My grandpa started this shop
92 years ago.

01:32.179 --> 01:33.310
Sir, that's not the...

01:33.397 --> 01:34.311
I live right upstairs.

01:34.398 --> 01:35.312
That's where I was born.

01:35.399 --> 01:37.053
My wife died there.

01:37.097 --> 01:40.012
And I'll be damned if
I'm gonna let you flatten it.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.972
Mr. Gillard, you've been paid,

01:43.103 --> 01:44.756
so now it's time to move on.

01:44.887 --> 01:46.106
Oh, yeah.

01:46.193 --> 01:48.412
About that check--

01:48.456 --> 01:50.806
I got a couple of ideas
of where you can stick it.

01:52.982 --> 01:54.723
Start the demolition.

01:54.810 --> 01:56.246
Well, he's
still there.

01:56.333 --> 01:58.727
Don't worry. He'll move.

02:01.164 --> 02:03.949
Take it down.
You got it.

02:30.367 --> 02:33.109
Over my dead body!

02:35.329 --> 02:38.375
So you almost
ran over a 73-year-old man?

02:38.419 --> 02:40.812
Mr. Gillard wasn't harmed,
and thanks to his antics,

02:40.899 --> 02:43.250
the building's
still standing, too.

02:43.337 --> 02:45.208
I sympathize
with Mr. Gillard,

02:45.252 --> 02:48.211
but the city has a legal right
to demolish that building.

02:48.255 --> 02:50.648
And he was paid fair market
value for his property.

02:50.735 --> 02:53.303
So this is an eminent domain
situation, Councilwoman?

02:53.347 --> 02:55.653
Yes. A judge granted
approval for the city

02:55.740 --> 02:57.786
to convert several buildings
in that neighborhood

02:57.873 --> 02:59.396
for the public good.

02:59.440 --> 03:00.702
So you're planning to knock down

03:00.789 --> 03:02.094
three blocks full
of homes and businesses

03:02.182 --> 03:03.444
to put up an office park.

03:03.531 --> 03:07.535
Not just any office park,
Dr. Bull.

03:08.492 --> 03:11.103
The Tidemarsh Tech Hub
will be a mecca

03:11.191 --> 03:13.105
of innovation and commerce.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.542
It'll bring in hundreds

03:14.629 --> 03:16.239
of high-paying jobs and

03:16.283 --> 03:17.632
increase the city's
revenue base.

03:17.719 --> 03:19.982
All for the low, low price
of one neighborhood.

03:20.069 --> 03:21.766
So if this has already
been signed off on,

03:21.853 --> 03:23.333
why are you coming to us?

03:23.377 --> 03:24.508
Because Mr. Gillard wasn't just

03:24.595 --> 03:26.554
chained to his shop.

03:28.425 --> 03:30.601
Ah.

03:30.688 --> 03:32.603
You're being sued
for civil fraud?

03:32.690 --> 03:35.606
Mr. Gillard is claiming
the Hub was designed

03:35.650 --> 03:38.087
to line the pockets of those
of us on the City Council

03:38.174 --> 03:40.132
and Mr. Krenell's company.
It's smart.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.525
It's basically
the only way

03:41.612 --> 03:43.310
to get an eminent domain
approval overturned.

03:43.353 --> 03:46.008
And if he succeeds,
the project will be dead.

03:46.095 --> 03:48.837
Mr. Krenell, it says here
your firm donated

03:48.924 --> 03:51.318
hundreds of thousands of dollars
to the campaigns

03:51.405 --> 03:52.797
of City Council members?

03:52.884 --> 03:54.364
This is New York City.

03:54.408 --> 03:56.714
Giving donations
is standard operating procedure

03:56.801 --> 03:58.325
if you want
to get anything done.

03:58.412 --> 04:00.152
I spearheaded this project,

04:00.240 --> 04:01.850
and as you'll see,
I didn't accept

04:01.937 --> 04:03.591
a penny from
Mr. Krenell.

04:03.634 --> 04:05.723
We did this the right
way, I promise you.

04:05.810 --> 04:07.856
I'm sorry. I just...

04:07.943 --> 04:09.727
I don't think that we're
the right firm for this.

04:09.814 --> 04:11.076
You guys have got

04:11.163 --> 04:12.687
hundreds of lawyers
in your employ.

04:12.774 --> 04:14.166
I'm sure one
of 'em can handle this.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.517
This case will be tricky
to navigate with a jury.

04:16.604 --> 04:19.041
And Mr. Gillard hired
an upstart, new firm

04:19.128 --> 04:20.738
trying to make
a name for itself.

04:20.782 --> 04:24.307
Apparently, they got some sort
of, uh, data wizard on staff

04:24.394 --> 04:26.091
who specializes

04:26.222 --> 04:27.484
in jury analysis.

04:28.659 --> 04:30.487
I'm sorry.
What's the name of the firm?

04:47.765 --> 04:49.289
Good luck.

04:49.332 --> 04:50.812
Hey, whose side
are you on?

04:50.899 --> 04:53.075
Everybody's? I don't know.
This is so weird.

04:54.076 --> 04:56.034
Ah.

04:56.121 --> 04:59.081
Bradley Lena. You've met
Chester Palmer, I think?

04:59.168 --> 05:01.866
- Of course.
- And Marissa, don't you look terrific.

05:01.997 --> 05:03.477
Very well rested.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.392
Must be nice not having
to juggle so many cases.

05:05.435 --> 05:08.308
Oh, we're very busy.
I'm just sleeping better.

05:08.395 --> 05:10.048
Wonderful.

05:10.135 --> 05:13.400
So, uh, you asked for
a settlement conference.

05:13.443 --> 05:16.054
I'm assuming you have a
proposal you want to throw out?

05:16.141 --> 05:18.709
Right. Take your time with it.

05:18.796 --> 05:20.842
Although I think
it's fairly concise.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.585
You're offering
our client a stall

05:24.672 --> 05:26.108
in the Tech Park's
food court?

05:26.238 --> 05:27.588
Yes. In perpetuity.

05:27.675 --> 05:29.677
In New York's
real estate market, I'd say

05:29.720 --> 05:33.245
what we're offering Mr. Gillard
is veritable a gold mine.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.595
It's a stall.

05:34.682 --> 05:36.684
It's nine feet
by five feet.

05:36.727 --> 05:39.643
Ooh, that's a typo. I think
it's actually closer to eight.

05:39.730 --> 05:42.951
Either way,
it is quite a generous offer.

05:43.038 --> 05:45.040
Considering the court has already

05:45.127 --> 05:48.652
awarded the city eminent domain,
and your client, Mr. Gillard,

05:48.696 --> 05:51.655
has been paid a very fair price
for his property.

05:51.742 --> 05:53.048
Your clients

05:53.135 --> 05:54.789
displaced Mr. Gillard and

05:54.876 --> 05:56.268
hundreds of other tenants
and business owners

05:56.356 --> 05:57.748
by fraudulent means.

05:57.835 --> 05:59.315
You have no proof of fraud.

05:59.359 --> 06:02.971
What you have is a client
who is resisting progress.

06:03.058 --> 06:06.496
People have been displaced
all over this great city.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.498
That's how we got
the Brooklyn Bridge,

06:08.585 --> 06:10.370
that's how we got
Central Park,

06:10.457 --> 06:12.023
our amazing
subway system.

06:12.110 --> 06:14.156
Do we regret those decisions?

06:16.767 --> 06:19.291
Your client isn't building
Central Park.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.163
It's a cubicle farm.

06:21.250 --> 06:23.383
It's a mecca for innovation.

06:23.470 --> 06:25.167
Okay.

06:25.254 --> 06:27.082
Bull, you've made your point,
wasted everyone's time.

06:27.212 --> 06:28.431
Congratulations.

06:28.518 --> 06:30.955
This meeting is over.

06:31.042 --> 06:32.870
Don't bother showing us out.

06:32.957 --> 06:35.569
I know exactly where
the exit is.

06:38.136 --> 06:40.138
I guess I'll see you in court.

06:40.225 --> 06:42.314
All right, see you in court.

06:44.447 --> 06:47.494
Is this how this whole thing
is gonna play out?

06:47.581 --> 06:48.538
What are you talking about?

06:50.235 --> 06:51.802
You knew they weren't gonna
accept this offer.

06:51.846 --> 06:53.369
It's a power move. Have them
come all the way up here

06:53.456 --> 06:55.023
and... Not true.

06:55.110 --> 06:57.068
It was a completely
- legitimate offer.
- Bull,

06:57.155 --> 06:58.983
you didn't want any part
of this case

06:59.027 --> 07:01.725
until you found out that Marissa
was gonna be on the other side.

07:01.769 --> 07:04.685
Now, when can we dispose
with all of the score settling

07:04.772 --> 07:06.034
and just get back to the law?

07:06.121 --> 07:08.079
There are no scores
being settled.

07:08.166 --> 07:11.648
She chose to leave this
company and work for our rival.

07:11.735 --> 07:13.215
We always knew
this day would come,

07:13.302 --> 07:15.173
where we would face off
against each other.

07:15.304 --> 07:16.610
Here we are.

07:16.697 --> 07:19.308
So I say we just
rip the Band-Aid off.

07:19.395 --> 07:21.441
So what if it hurts a little?

07:33.540 --> 07:35.193
I still can't believe Erik's
suing for full custody.

07:35.280 --> 07:36.717
We didn't even
fight over custody

07:36.804 --> 07:38.066
when we first
got divorced.

07:38.153 --> 07:39.937
Mm. I've seen this
happen before.

07:39.981 --> 07:41.635
Things are simple when both
parents live in the same town

07:41.678 --> 07:44.115
after a divorce, but when
lives start to change...

07:44.202 --> 07:46.596
He can't take Mauricio
to live in Hawaii.

07:46.640 --> 07:49.425
Please tell me
- we can stop him.
- I believe we can.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.079
New York courts favor
maintaining parental rights.

07:51.209 --> 07:52.863
Oh, that's good.

07:52.907 --> 07:55.387
Mauricio has spent his
entire life in New York City.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.780
He's settled
in his school here.

07:56.867 --> 07:58.086
That'll count
with the judge.

07:58.173 --> 07:59.740
He absolutely loves
his school.

07:59.827 --> 08:01.176
Mrs. Summers, his teacher--

08:01.263 --> 08:03.134
he talks about her
literally all the time.

08:03.221 --> 08:04.527
The one trouble area
is your association

08:04.614 --> 08:06.094
with this hacker, Tidal.

08:06.181 --> 08:07.965
But while it's not ideal,
we're going to...

08:08.052 --> 08:10.054
It's ridiculous this Tidal
thing is even an issue.

08:10.141 --> 08:12.579
I knew her for, what?
Like, three days?

08:12.622 --> 08:15.059
I've had naps that have lasted
longer than that.

08:15.146 --> 08:16.887
But you know Erik's team
is gonna make us out

08:16.931 --> 08:18.541
to be some sort of the
new Thelma and Louise.

08:18.628 --> 08:20.151
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

08:20.238 --> 08:23.024
Erik knows I would never
associate with a criminal.

08:23.111 --> 08:25.548
He's the creep who
- had me followed.
- Taylor!

08:25.635 --> 08:27.768
Sorry.

08:27.855 --> 08:31.249
Your frustration is
completely understandable.

08:31.336 --> 08:33.643
But don't worry. We'll handle
the Tidal situation.

08:33.687 --> 08:35.950
I've helped parents maintain
custody with far

08:36.037 --> 08:37.299
bigger strikes against them.

08:37.386 --> 08:39.693
Really?
Absolutely.

08:39.736 --> 08:42.522
But there's something
I need you to understand.

08:42.565 --> 08:45.220
During the hearing, both you
and Erik will be on display,

08:45.307 --> 08:47.396
and the judge will be
watching everything.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.311
So you have to keep your anger,

08:49.398 --> 08:52.053
no matter how justified,
under control.

08:52.140 --> 08:53.620
You don't have to
worry about me.

08:53.707 --> 08:55.143
I work for a trial
science company.

08:55.230 --> 08:56.666
I know how to behave
in a courtroom.

08:56.753 --> 08:58.668
Not this one.

08:58.755 --> 09:00.540
Family court's
a whole different animal.

09:00.583 --> 09:03.760
The issues being decided there
are incredibly primal.

09:03.804 --> 09:07.024
It's the place where people who
never fall apart, fall apart.

09:07.068 --> 09:10.506
So the most important thing
for you to do is keep your cool.

09:14.858 --> 09:16.077
Good morning. It's
voir dire prep day.

09:16.164 --> 09:17.382
Is there anything better?

09:17.469 --> 09:18.949
I can think of a few things.

09:18.993 --> 09:20.647
- It was a rhetorical question.
- What you thinking?

09:20.734 --> 09:23.258
We have the home
court advantage.

09:23.388 --> 09:24.825
How's that?

09:24.868 --> 09:27.044
This is New York City,
and everybody knows

09:27.131 --> 09:29.220
if you look closely enough
at any major project,

09:29.307 --> 09:31.353
you're probably gonna
find something fishy.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.224
Or a body buried
in the foundation.

09:33.311 --> 09:35.705
You, my jaded friend, are
exactly the kind of New Yorker

09:35.792 --> 09:37.577
we want on our jury.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.579
Someone who understands you have
to walk through the gutter

09:39.622 --> 09:40.841
to get to the other side
of the street.

09:40.928 --> 09:43.104
Okay, so, jaded New Yorkers.

09:43.147 --> 09:46.107
That's not bad. Any idea what
Marissa's gonna be thinking?

09:46.150 --> 09:49.937
Oh, I know exactly what
Marissa's gonna be thinking.

09:49.980 --> 09:53.680
She is gonna go all in
for traditionalists.

09:53.767 --> 09:56.465
These are folks
who place a high value

09:56.552 --> 09:58.554
on maintaining the city's
history and uniqueness.

09:58.598 --> 10:01.688
Makes sense to me.
Any thoughts on questions?

10:01.775 --> 10:03.385
Yeah, I was thinking...

10:05.039 --> 10:06.997
Uh...

10:07.084 --> 10:08.738
What are you doing?

10:08.782 --> 10:11.175
This is exactly who Bull will
expect us to try to seat.

10:11.262 --> 10:13.090
We have to stay one step ahead
of him.

10:13.177 --> 10:15.484
All right. So what now?

10:15.571 --> 10:17.573
Bull's snap judgements
on people are spot-on.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.357
Better than anyone
I have ever met.

10:19.444 --> 10:21.838
But the fact is, people are more
than first impressions.

10:21.882 --> 10:23.144
Thank God or I never
would've gotten a date

10:23.231 --> 10:24.754
back in high school.

10:24.798 --> 10:28.062
Bull's weakness is
that he doesn't always dig deep.

10:28.105 --> 10:30.107
That is what I am good at,
and he still doesn't have

10:30.194 --> 10:31.456
a replacement for me.

10:31.543 --> 10:33.241
- No, he does not.
- I've already started

10:33.328 --> 10:35.069
analyzing our jury pool.

10:35.156 --> 10:37.245
Instead of just considering
one or two

10:37.332 --> 10:39.726
controlling factors,
like we did at TAC,

10:39.769 --> 10:43.904
I think the better move
is for me to look at dozens.

10:43.991 --> 10:46.515
I am gonna know
these jurors so well,

10:46.602 --> 10:48.691
Bull will not have time
for instinct.

10:48.735 --> 10:50.911
Well, this all sounds amazing,
but I have to point out

10:50.998 --> 10:52.564
that voir dire
starts tomorrow.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.871
Well, I never said
it was gonna be an easy night,

10:54.958 --> 10:56.612
but I'm gonna be ready.

10:58.483 --> 10:59.963
- Oh.
- Yeah. With the knuckles. Yup.

11:00.050 --> 11:02.313
Thank you.
There it is.

11:11.192 --> 11:13.411
Damn. Marissa came prepared.

11:13.542 --> 11:14.891
I'll take my gut instinct

11:14.935 --> 11:16.588
over her charts
and graphs any day.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.329
Counselors, when you're ready.

11:21.550 --> 11:23.465
Good morning.
Morning.

11:23.552 --> 11:27.774
Today, I'd like to talk
to you about rats.

11:27.861 --> 11:30.080
You, sir--
how do you feel

11:30.167 --> 11:31.647
about the city's rat situation?

11:31.691 --> 11:34.084
It's disgusting.
But what are you gonna do?

11:34.171 --> 11:36.391
You don't think that
we can get rid of them?

11:36.478 --> 11:37.740
You're kidding.

11:37.784 --> 11:40.612
First, you got
to get new trash bins.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.224
The garbage trucks got
to pick them up more often.

11:43.311 --> 11:44.399
That takes money.

11:44.529 --> 11:45.617
And you'd probably

11:45.705 --> 11:47.315
have to poison a bunch of 'em.

11:47.402 --> 11:49.752
And you know, people have
opinions about that.

11:49.796 --> 11:52.929
Nah, it'd be like doing
anything else in this city--

11:53.016 --> 11:54.626
a pain in the ass.

11:56.803 --> 11:58.282
Your Honor,
juror number six

11:58.369 --> 12:01.329
is acceptable to the defense.

12:01.416 --> 12:03.461
Juror number six is also
acceptable to the plaintiffs.

12:06.203 --> 12:08.031
Jurors number 12, 15

12:08.118 --> 12:09.946
and 19 are also acceptable.

12:09.990 --> 12:12.340
Aren't you gonna ask them
any questions first?

12:12.427 --> 12:14.864
No, Your Honor. We have
all the information we need.

12:16.605 --> 12:18.041
Uh, one moment,

12:18.128 --> 12:19.913
please, Your Honor.

12:21.523 --> 12:24.178
I may have underestimated
Marissa's charts.

12:25.353 --> 12:26.658
So what do we do?

12:26.746 --> 12:29.052
Well, when you're going to lose,

12:29.096 --> 12:31.968
there's only one thing left
you can do--

12:32.055 --> 12:33.970
kick over the board.

12:34.057 --> 12:35.929
What are they up to?

12:36.016 --> 12:38.453
No idea,
but I don't like it.

12:38.540 --> 12:40.063
Excuse me. Could I
have the attention

12:40.107 --> 12:42.805
of all of the juror
candidates, and including

12:42.892 --> 12:44.633
jurors in the gallery?

12:44.720 --> 12:46.156
Uh, who here has been arrested

12:46.243 --> 12:48.245
by the NYPD?

12:48.332 --> 12:50.595
And if you would, please,
keep your hands raised.

12:50.682 --> 12:53.381
Um, anyone's business
has been cited

12:53.511 --> 12:55.209
by the city?

12:55.339 --> 12:57.211
And finally,

12:57.341 --> 12:58.473
Who here

12:58.560 --> 12:59.996
has received
a parking ticket?

13:00.083 --> 13:02.520
Your Honor,

13:02.607 --> 13:04.566
we request that all
of the juror candidates

13:04.653 --> 13:06.829
with their hands raised
be excused for cause.

13:06.873 --> 13:08.788
Well, they've all suffered
at the hands of the city.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.485
They won't be impartial.

13:10.572 --> 13:13.401
Crap. He is trying to change out
the entire jury pool.

13:13.488 --> 13:15.055
All my research
will be useless.

13:15.142 --> 13:16.534
We'll be flying blind.

13:16.621 --> 13:18.058
Your Honor, this
is ridiculous.

13:18.145 --> 13:19.581
Everyone has
parking tickets.

13:19.668 --> 13:21.801
That's not true.
I don't have parking tickets.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.585
I don't even drive a car.

13:23.672 --> 13:25.674
And it looks like
I'm not alone.

13:25.761 --> 13:27.545
Mr. Palmer, I'm inclined

13:27.632 --> 13:29.460
to agree
with plaintiff's counsel.

13:29.547 --> 13:31.680
This feels like a stretch.

13:31.767 --> 13:34.683
I suppose we could file
an interlocutory appeal.

13:34.770 --> 13:37.164
See what the appellate
court thinks.

13:37.251 --> 13:40.428
No. That won't be necessary.

13:41.864 --> 13:43.170
The court thanks
and dismisses

13:43.257 --> 13:45.389
all the jurors
with their hands raised.

13:45.476 --> 13:46.826
Your Honor, at this rate,
we won't be able to seat

13:46.913 --> 13:47.957
anyone on this jury.

13:48.044 --> 13:49.089
Do you think I've never

13:49.176 --> 13:50.481
sat juries before, Counselor?

13:50.568 --> 13:53.136
I'll pull in more jurors

13:53.223 --> 13:54.529
from the central jury room.

13:54.659 --> 13:56.792
It'll be fine.

13:58.141 --> 14:00.143
Was that bad?

14:00.230 --> 14:02.842
Oh, uh, uh...

14:04.800 --> 14:07.237
No, no, no, no, no.
Recycling's around the corner.

14:10.371 --> 14:11.938
Grab some lunch
and regroup?

14:12.025 --> 14:13.417
Bull loves a curveball.

14:13.504 --> 14:15.637
I should have been
more prepared for that.

14:15.724 --> 14:17.769
Ah, it doesn't matter.
Right now,

14:17.857 --> 14:20.163
you're living rent-free
in that guy's head.

14:20.207 --> 14:21.817
The more time he spends
focused on you,

14:21.861 --> 14:23.950
the less time he's
focused on the case.

14:27.040 --> 14:29.564
Now, have we worked
together long enough

14:29.651 --> 14:31.000
to eat ramen in front
of each other?

14:37.833 --> 14:39.835
I got the updated
witness list.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.793
Looks like Erik's team
just added a new one.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.318
Who is Rachel Ness?

14:44.405 --> 14:45.841
- Rachel?
- Yeah.

14:45.928 --> 14:47.364
She's Erik's ex.

14:53.980 --> 14:57.287
Guess she's not such an ex
anymore.

14:57.331 --> 14:59.333
Erik and I were together
for about a year and a half.

14:59.376 --> 15:02.031
We took some time apart,
and reconnected two months ago.

15:02.118 --> 15:04.207
But I think the break
helped focus us.

15:04.251 --> 15:07.080
We're more committed than ever
to the relationship.

15:07.123 --> 15:08.995
Won't maintaining
a relationship be difficult

15:09.082 --> 15:10.692
with Erik relocating
to Hawaii?

15:10.779 --> 15:13.825
Um, actually...
I'll be moving with him.

15:13.913 --> 15:17.351
And have you and Erik talked
about what kind of role

15:17.438 --> 15:19.440
that you would play
in Mauricio's upbringing?

15:19.483 --> 15:22.573
We have. Obviously, it's gonna
be a big transition for him.

15:22.660 --> 15:24.880
And since I'm not planning
on working once I get there,

15:24.924 --> 15:26.621
we thought I could help him
with the changes

15:26.708 --> 15:28.144
by being
- his full-time caregiver.
- Mm-hmm.

15:28.231 --> 15:29.145
And you mentioned

15:29.232 --> 15:30.451
you've been dating Erik

15:30.538 --> 15:32.192
[whispering]for close to two years now.

15:32.235 --> 15:34.629
And I'm guessing
that you've observed both his

15:34.716 --> 15:37.197
and Ms. Rentzel's
relationship with Mauricio?

15:37.284 --> 15:39.068
I have.
Erik's an amazing dad,

15:39.155 --> 15:41.810
incredibly devoted.

15:41.897 --> 15:43.725
It doesn't matter if he's got
a deadline or a big deal.

15:43.812 --> 15:46.119
He's always there
for Mauricio. Always.

15:46.162 --> 15:48.556
And Ms. Rentzel?

15:48.643 --> 15:50.297
Taylor is great, too.
I mean, she loves

15:50.384 --> 15:53.343
Mauricio to bits.
There is no question about that.

15:53.430 --> 15:57.260
It's just...
with her, it feels like

15:57.347 --> 16:00.307
it's one work emergency
after another.

16:00.394 --> 16:02.744
And I know
she's doing her best,

16:02.831 --> 16:06.052
but even I have had to step in
and watch Mauricio several times

16:06.139 --> 16:07.401
because she was too busy.

16:07.488 --> 16:08.968
That's not true.

16:09.011 --> 16:11.274
It's way more complicated
than that.

16:19.761 --> 16:21.806
How dare you.

16:21.893 --> 16:24.984
You think
I'm the bad guy? Me?

16:25.027 --> 16:25.985
- Whoa.
- Guessing he didn't tell you about

16:26.072 --> 16:27.290
our little sleepovers, then.

16:27.377 --> 16:28.726
What-What is she talking about?

16:28.813 --> 16:30.641
We had sex while you were dating

16:30.728 --> 16:32.469
and probably still would be
if I hadn't called it off.

16:32.556 --> 16:34.210
- What the hell are you doing?
- Oh, that's too low?

16:34.254 --> 16:36.996
But you get a free pass
to take my son away from me?

16:37.039 --> 16:38.606
You think I'm doing this
just to spite you?

16:38.693 --> 16:40.086
This is about Mauricio.

16:40.129 --> 16:42.914
- That's a damn lie!
- Taylor, come with me.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.481
Okay.

16:44.568 --> 16:47.049
Just because you're screwing
someone who doesn't care

16:47.093 --> 16:48.529
about having a career doesn't
make you a better parent!

16:48.659 --> 16:49.704
Taylor.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.666
Let's go. Now.

17:02.151 --> 17:03.500
Are the plaintiffs ready
to call their first witness?

17:03.587 --> 17:05.067
Yes, Your Honor.

17:05.111 --> 17:07.069
We'd like to call
Thomas Krenell to the stand.

17:07.156 --> 17:08.984
They're calling me?

17:09.028 --> 17:11.943
Are they even
- allowed to do this?
- Objection.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.989
Your Honor, this is
purely theatrical.

17:14.076 --> 17:15.425
On the contrary,
Your Honor.

17:15.512 --> 17:17.210
This case is about
real estate development.

17:17.253 --> 17:19.081
Calling the developer
at the center of it all

17:19.125 --> 17:20.735
seems like a logical
place to start.

17:20.822 --> 17:22.432
And as you're well aware,
defendants are fair game

17:22.519 --> 17:23.694
in a civil trial.

17:23.781 --> 17:25.740
Overruled,
Mr. Palmer.

17:25.827 --> 17:27.046
Plaintiff may call the witness.

17:27.133 --> 17:28.351
You'll do great.

17:32.877 --> 17:34.792
I wasn't prepared
for Krenell to take the stand

17:34.879 --> 17:37.012
until we called him.
He hasn't been fully prepped.

17:37.056 --> 17:40.015
He is what he is-- an arrogant
real estate developer.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.061
I don't think our jaded
New Yorkers will care.

17:42.148 --> 17:44.454
Mr. Krenell,

17:44.541 --> 17:47.153
can you confirm
that the area indicated here

17:47.196 --> 17:49.894
in yellow is where you plan
to build your Hub development?

17:51.766 --> 17:53.159
Yes.

17:53.202 --> 17:55.248
And did you direct
your investment partners

17:55.335 --> 17:56.684
to purchase properties

17:56.771 --> 17:58.599
adjoining the Hub development,
indicated

17:58.686 --> 18:00.905
here in red,
months prior to

18:00.992 --> 18:02.516
any public announcement
of the project?

18:02.603 --> 18:03.952
Yes, I did.

18:04.039 --> 18:05.693
Isn't it true that,
since then,

18:05.780 --> 18:08.174
their value has increased
more than sixfold?

18:08.217 --> 18:10.132
- Your point?
- I guess I'm a little confused.

18:10.219 --> 18:11.612
At every public hearing

18:11.699 --> 18:12.961
where the project was discussed,

18:13.048 --> 18:14.267
you swore it was the best thing

18:14.354 --> 18:16.007
for the community.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.531
But really,
it was the best thing

18:17.574 --> 18:18.880
for you and your investors,
isn't that right?

18:18.967 --> 18:20.838
I never claimed
to be a non-profit.

18:20.969 --> 18:22.797
Just because I made money

18:22.884 --> 18:25.278
doesn't mean it wasn't good
for the city, too.

18:25.365 --> 18:26.888
Our jaded jurors
look bored.

18:26.975 --> 18:28.585
Would you say, then,

18:28.629 --> 18:31.327
that you considered the
concerns of the community?

18:31.414 --> 18:32.807
Of course I did.

18:32.894 --> 18:34.374
With the court's permission,
we'd like

18:34.461 --> 18:36.637
to introduce
an audio recording taken

18:36.724 --> 18:38.552
at the August 17
annual property group meeting.

18:38.595 --> 18:41.120
Objection! This hasn't been
properly introduced, Your Honor.

18:41.163 --> 18:43.513
As Mr. Krenell is the subject in the recording,

18:43.600 --> 18:44.645
he can authenticate it himself.

18:46.212 --> 18:47.996
I'll allow it.

18:48.127 --> 18:51.304
Proceed.

18:51.347 --> 18:53.523
Every deal I've done,

18:53.567 --> 18:55.525
investors have been worried
about public backlash,

18:55.612 --> 18:57.179
community opinion.

18:57.223 --> 18:59.964
These people, "the public"
you're so scared of--

19:00.051 --> 19:03.011
at the end of the day, they just
want to be told what to do.

19:03.098 --> 19:05.100
They're nothing but sheeple.

19:05.144 --> 19:08.190
They'll moan and complain,
but you give them a place

19:08.234 --> 19:12.020
to buy a Big Gulp,
scratch-off lotto tickets,

19:12.107 --> 19:15.154
and they'll follow along,
fat and happy.

19:15.241 --> 19:16.285
Objection, Your Honor.

19:16.372 --> 19:17.765
This is unduly prejudicial.

19:17.852 --> 19:19.854
It's a cheap trick
by plaintiff's counsel

19:19.984 --> 19:21.160
to inflame the jury.

19:21.247 --> 19:23.292
And it worked.

19:24.815 --> 19:26.948
Our jurors might ignore
some low-level fraud,

19:26.991 --> 19:30.212
but no New Yorker worth their
salt is gonna ignore an insult.

19:30.256 --> 19:32.083
Any idea
where I can get a lotto ticket

19:32.171 --> 19:33.694
and a Big Gulp around here?

19:33.781 --> 19:36.262
Never mind. I'll figure it out.
See you tomorrow.

19:37.393 --> 19:40.396
What was that you said about New
Yorkers not ignoring insults?

19:40.440 --> 19:42.833
They made Krenell look
like a real ass in there.

19:42.877 --> 19:45.793
Yeah. I don't like being caught
on my back foot.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.925
Listen, we better find out

19:48.012 --> 19:50.058
if there's any other
boogeymen in Lisa's closet.

19:50.145 --> 19:52.278
Danny's been looking
into the councilwoman.

19:52.321 --> 19:54.584
She's a Girl Scout.
But I can have her dig deeper.

19:54.671 --> 19:57.718
Yeah, let's go Grand Canyon
deep, shall we?

19:57.805 --> 19:59.415
I want to know everything
she touched in office.

19:59.459 --> 20:02.070
Every stop sign she
was responsible for,

20:02.157 --> 20:04.115
every baby she kissed
on her way there.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.813
Is there anything
that we can do?

20:05.900 --> 20:08.032
I'd like to catch them
on their back foot.

20:08.119 --> 20:10.296
Well, I thought you were
above settling scores.

20:10.339 --> 20:13.473
I am, but it's like we used
to say about tackling.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.257
It's nothing personal,
but sometimes,

20:15.344 --> 20:16.606
you just got
to lay somebody out.

20:16.693 --> 20:17.999
Well, they threw
dirt on our guy.

20:18.129 --> 20:19.696
Let's dig up some on theirs.

20:19.783 --> 20:22.177
All right,
we've got your T-shirts,

20:22.264 --> 20:24.005
your pajamas,
your underwear.

20:24.092 --> 20:25.746
Wait. Where are your socks?

20:25.833 --> 20:28.357
Squeeze 'em in there, kiddo.

20:35.973 --> 20:37.758
All right.

20:37.845 --> 20:40.587
Are you and Daddy mad
at each other?

20:40.674 --> 20:42.763
Why do you say that?

20:42.850 --> 20:45.331
Because you both seem mad.

20:45.374 --> 20:48.203
Well, sometimes mommies
and daddies have

20:48.290 --> 20:49.639
to figure things out.

20:49.726 --> 20:51.685
But you don't need
to worry about that,

20:51.772 --> 20:53.687
'cause we've got it
all handled, okay?

20:54.688 --> 20:57.125
Okay.

20:57.212 --> 20:59.823
I love you more than anything.

21:08.702 --> 21:10.704
Hey, there.
Right on time.

21:10.791 --> 21:12.619
Good. Mauricio, you ready?

21:14.142 --> 21:16.144
I'll have him call
- in the morning.
- Perfect.

21:16.231 --> 21:19.626
Uh-oh. My Iron Man toothbrush.

21:22.063 --> 21:23.847
Just so you know,

21:23.934 --> 21:26.067
Rachel and I haven't
mentioned the custody hearing

21:26.154 --> 21:28.504
or said anything negative
about you in front of Mauricio.

21:28.591 --> 21:30.680
Like we agreed.

21:31.855 --> 21:33.553
I didn't want it this way.

21:33.640 --> 21:34.815
Well, you made it this way.

21:42.257 --> 21:44.390
Well, I'm stopping by Dimitri's

21:44.433 --> 21:45.739
to squeeze in
a little extra prep

21:45.826 --> 21:48.176
before he gets
on the stand today.

21:48.263 --> 21:50.221
Okay. I'll see you
at the courthouse.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.919
Bye, Bradley.

21:53.224 --> 21:57.577
Dimitri, you're not supposed
to be open yet.

21:57.620 --> 22:00.101
Y-You're not allowed to do
business unless we win.

22:00.188 --> 22:02.843
There were customers waiting.
How could I turn them away?

22:02.973 --> 22:03.887
Well, I...

22:04.018 --> 22:05.802
Morning.

22:05.889 --> 22:09.632
Ah, you know each other?
This is why I love New York.

22:09.676 --> 22:11.808
I'll grab a place setting
so you can join your friend.

22:11.895 --> 22:14.898
Bull sent you, didn't he?

22:14.985 --> 22:17.597
Hmm. Maybe I just wanted
some good hash browns.

22:17.684 --> 22:19.033
You got to go.

22:19.163 --> 22:21.296
All right, I'll go.

22:24.865 --> 22:26.780
You know, uh,

22:26.867 --> 22:28.825
you got Bull pretty fired up
over this case, right?

22:28.956 --> 22:30.392
Good.

22:37.399 --> 22:40.141
Oh. Your friend left already.
That's too bad.

22:40.271 --> 22:41.708
Did you talk to her?

22:41.795 --> 22:43.840
Oh, yeah. She asked all kinds
of questions

22:43.927 --> 22:46.277
about my place,
the neighborhood,

22:46.365 --> 22:47.844
that fire we had
a couple of years ago.

22:47.931 --> 22:49.280
She was real easy

22:49.368 --> 22:51.326
- to talk to.
- I bet.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.590
What did you tell her
about the fire?

22:54.634 --> 22:58.246
Mr. Gillard, did you light
your own business on fire?

22:58.333 --> 23:01.554
That's ridiculous.
Of course not.

23:01.597 --> 23:03.991
I love the Tough Penny.
It's my home.

23:04.078 --> 23:05.384
But it's also your business.

23:05.471 --> 23:06.689
And in the four months prior

23:06.776 --> 23:08.299
to the fire,
your business was suffering.

23:08.387 --> 23:09.736
Sales were down

23:09.823 --> 23:12.260
almost 20%,
is that correct?

23:12.347 --> 23:14.262
It was a little slump.
They were fixing the sidewalks.

23:14.349 --> 23:15.829
It was hard
for people to get in.

23:15.872 --> 23:17.700
But a big check
from an insurance company--

23:17.787 --> 23:19.354
well, that surely
would have helped out

23:19.398 --> 23:20.790
- with that little slump.
- No.

23:20.877 --> 23:22.270
That's not how it was at all.

23:23.837 --> 23:27.971
Mr. Gillard,
this is a verified copy

23:28.058 --> 23:29.973
of the insurance claim
that you filed.

23:30.060 --> 23:31.975
Can you read for the jury
what is stamped

23:32.062 --> 23:34.021
across the front of this page?

23:35.631 --> 23:37.416
"Rejected."

23:37.459 --> 23:39.374
And isn't it true that the insurance company

23:39.461 --> 23:41.420
rejected your claim

23:41.463 --> 23:43.509
because the investigation
that they conducted

23:43.552 --> 23:45.989
into the cause of the fire
came back as inconclusive?

23:46.076 --> 23:48.905
They couldn't determine
whether it was an accident

23:49.036 --> 23:50.298
or arson.

23:50.385 --> 23:52.387
They just didn't want to pay.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.737
The grease trap wasn't cleaned
properly. That's what happened.

23:54.824 --> 23:58.132
Or maybe,
maybe the city and Mr. Krenell

23:58.262 --> 24:00.351
are not the frauds.

24:02.005 --> 24:03.180
You are.

24:03.311 --> 24:06.096
Objection! Inflammatory.

24:09.665 --> 24:11.885
- That was low.
- What are we talking about?

24:11.972 --> 24:14.017
You know very well

24:14.104 --> 24:16.411
Dimitri didn't try
to burn down his place.

24:16.498 --> 24:17.847
If this was
about money for him,

24:17.934 --> 24:19.719
he would have cashed
Krenell's check.

24:19.762 --> 24:21.808
It was four times what that
insurance policy was worth.

24:21.895 --> 24:23.113
Well, it doesn't matter
what I think.

24:23.200 --> 24:24.767
It matters
what the jury thinks.

24:24.811 --> 24:26.726
Dimitri's a good man. You should
be ashamed of yourself.

24:26.813 --> 24:28.728
For what? Making the
other side look bad?

24:28.815 --> 24:30.251
That's the game.

24:30.338 --> 24:32.079
This isn't
about making Dimitri look bad.

24:32.166 --> 24:33.820
This is about
making me look bad.

24:33.863 --> 24:35.909
Oh, it's about winning.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.086
That's what TAC does.
We win.

24:39.173 --> 24:40.609
If you didn't want
to be on the losing side,

24:40.696 --> 24:42.393
you shouldn't have left.

24:43.786 --> 24:45.353
The whole time
I was on your team,

24:45.484 --> 24:47.224
I always thought you had a code.

24:49.052 --> 24:52.142
But I guess you're not
the person I thought you were.

24:58.845 --> 24:59.889
When you were working
with Zola Macer,

24:59.976 --> 25:01.848
the hacker who goes by "Tidal,"

25:01.891 --> 25:04.677
were you aware that she was a
person of interest for the FBI?

25:04.720 --> 25:08.332
No. I had no idea until I was
contacted by Agent Delgado.

25:08.419 --> 25:10.334
And did Agent Delgado
arrest you?

25:10.421 --> 25:13.903
No. He questioned me
about my knowledge of Ms. Macer,

25:13.990 --> 25:15.601
but he never brought any charges
against me.

25:15.644 --> 25:17.907
So the FBI found no criminal
activity on your part?

25:18.038 --> 25:19.387
No.

25:19.474 --> 25:21.084
Because I hadn't done
anything wrong.

25:21.171 --> 25:22.608
Ms. Rentzel,

25:22.651 --> 25:24.261
earlier in the proceedings,
we heard mention

25:24.348 --> 25:27.221
of your demanding
work schedule.

25:27.308 --> 25:29.049
Would you agree
with this characterization?

25:29.179 --> 25:30.093
It's challenging

25:30.180 --> 25:31.442
and important work.

25:31.530 --> 25:34.533
So, yes, it can be demanding.

25:34.620 --> 25:37.579
And honestly, yes,

25:37.666 --> 25:39.625
sometimes I do find it difficult

25:39.668 --> 25:41.714
to balance my work
and home life.

25:41.757 --> 25:44.020
Isn't that true of almost all
working mothers?

25:44.107 --> 25:46.675
But if I need to cut back
my hours to keep my son,

25:46.762 --> 25:48.808
I will absolutely do that.

25:48.895 --> 25:51.332
Just to be clear,
you're willing

25:51.419 --> 25:53.769
to reduce your work load
if the court determines

25:53.813 --> 25:55.641
it's necessary
for you to maintain custody?

25:55.728 --> 25:57.686
Yes. I'll do whatever it takes.

25:57.730 --> 25:59.862
Mauricio is the most important
thing in the world to me.

25:59.949 --> 26:01.864
He always has been.

26:03.213 --> 26:05.520
No further questions,
Your Honor.

26:08.349 --> 26:09.872
Ms. Rentzel, isn't it true

26:09.916 --> 26:12.919
that your work for the Trial
Analysis Corporation--

26:13.006 --> 26:14.573
it doesn't just require
long hours,

26:14.616 --> 26:16.923
it can also be quite dangerous,
as well?

26:19.621 --> 26:20.970
No, I wouldn't say that.

26:21.057 --> 26:22.232
You wouldn't?

26:22.319 --> 26:23.582
Didn't you just testify

26:23.669 --> 26:25.366
that your work forced you

26:25.453 --> 26:27.847
to associate
with an alleged criminal?

26:27.977 --> 26:29.892
I work in criminal defense

26:29.979 --> 26:31.546
So, yes, on occasion,

26:31.590 --> 26:33.809
I'm going to encounter
an alleged criminal.

26:33.896 --> 26:36.420
Just like lawyers and judges

26:36.507 --> 26:38.945
and anyone who works
in the justice system.

26:39.032 --> 26:40.860
But I've never felt like
I was in any danger.

26:40.903 --> 26:43.384
So, you didn't feel like
you were in danger

26:43.471 --> 26:44.733
when there was an anthrax attack

26:44.820 --> 26:46.430
at your office
two years ago?

26:46.561 --> 26:47.954
That was a hoax.

26:48.041 --> 26:49.346
There was never
any anthrax involved.

26:49.433 --> 26:51.392
It was just
someone trying

26:51.479 --> 26:53.350
- to scare us.
- Well, what about when

26:53.394 --> 26:57.093
your boss, Jason Bull's child
was kidnapped a few months ago?

26:57.180 --> 26:58.791
Was that a hoax?

27:01.228 --> 27:03.186
That had nothing to do with TAC.

27:03.273 --> 27:06.363
Really? Didn't you
and your work colleagues

27:06.494 --> 27:08.017
handle that kidnapping

27:08.104 --> 27:09.715
without the aid
of the police?

27:09.802 --> 27:11.586
Yes, but... And isn't it true

27:11.630 --> 27:13.066
that in the wake
of the kidnapping,

27:13.153 --> 27:14.458
you told your ex-husband

27:14.545 --> 27:17.287
you feared for
Mauricio's safety?

27:18.898 --> 27:20.464
I didn't...

27:22.118 --> 27:24.120
I didn't mean it like that.

27:24.164 --> 27:26.862
Something terrible had just
happened to someone I knew,

27:26.949 --> 27:28.647
so, yes,
of course it had an impact.

27:28.734 --> 27:30.736
Excuse me, Counselor,
if I may?

27:30.823 --> 27:32.128
Of course, Your Honor.

27:32.215 --> 27:34.130
Did you or did you not fear

27:34.217 --> 27:36.393
for your child's safety
because of your job?

27:38.831 --> 27:42.312
In that moment, yes, but...

27:42.443 --> 27:44.532
I was just...

27:46.229 --> 27:48.275
...emotional.

27:54.673 --> 27:57.110
- Hmm.
- Hold up.

27:57.197 --> 27:58.328
What's this?

27:58.459 --> 27:59.765
I don't know.

27:59.852 --> 28:01.331
Sounds promising.

28:01.418 --> 28:02.724
Well, I've been making my way
through the truckload

28:02.811 --> 28:04.160
of documents
the city sent over.

28:04.247 --> 28:06.075
Everything Lisa ever touched.

28:06.119 --> 28:08.556
- And?
- Well, eight months before plans were announced

28:08.687 --> 28:10.340
for the Tidemarsh Tech Hub,

28:10.384 --> 28:13.343
the city initiated a structural
integrity inspection

28:13.430 --> 28:15.041
for Dimitri's block.

28:15.084 --> 28:17.173
These kind of inspections
are like shortcuts

28:17.260 --> 28:19.132
for municipalities wanting
to redevelop.

28:19.219 --> 28:20.611
So if they find a building
is dangerous,

28:20.699 --> 28:22.309
it's easier to condemn.

28:22.396 --> 28:24.615
And no tricky eminent domain
proceedings to manage.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.922
- So what did they find?
- Well, that's the odd thing.

28:26.966 --> 28:30.143
Nothing, because
they halted the inspection

28:30.230 --> 28:31.927
when they got
to Dimitri's building.

28:32.014 --> 28:33.537
Well, that's interesting timing.

28:33.624 --> 28:37.019
Very. My guess is,
there may be more to this story,

28:37.063 --> 28:39.413
and that story may not be
a good one for our clients.

28:39.500 --> 28:41.154
But I'll keep digging,

28:41.241 --> 28:42.808
- see what I can find.
- I'm not sure we want to do that.

28:42.851 --> 28:44.810
- What do you mean?
- Right now, the absence

28:44.853 --> 28:47.377
of a completed inspection report
is a nothing.

28:47.464 --> 28:49.075
But if we keep digging,

28:49.162 --> 28:51.338
and we find a little something,

28:51.425 --> 28:53.557
I am afraid that that will fall
under Marissa

28:53.644 --> 28:55.646
and Bradley's
discovery requests,

28:55.734 --> 28:58.432
and we will be obligated
to share it with them.

29:00.260 --> 29:01.914
Aren't we obligated now?

29:02.001 --> 29:03.393
Is there an argument
to be made

29:03.480 --> 29:05.134
that we don't have
to share it with them?

29:05.265 --> 29:07.136
Chunk?

29:07.180 --> 29:09.878
There can be an argument made
for all manner of things, Bull.

29:09.965 --> 29:12.011
But that doesn't
mean you should.

29:13.664 --> 29:16.493
Okay, send that on over.

29:16.580 --> 29:18.887
That way, when Marissa
eventually loses,

29:19.018 --> 29:20.062
she will have toay

29:20.149 --> 29:21.629
that we were 100% above board.

29:21.716 --> 29:24.806
But there's no reason
to do their job for them, so,

29:24.850 --> 29:26.547
put as many documents
as you can get your hands on

29:26.677 --> 29:28.592
on top of that.

29:28.679 --> 29:30.377
If we're giving Marissa
the needle,

29:30.464 --> 29:33.249
we might as well give her
the whole haystack.

29:35.599 --> 29:37.079
Hey.

29:37.123 --> 29:38.733
Sorry. I know I'm not supposed
to be calling you

29:38.777 --> 29:40.169
because of the case
and everything, but...

29:40.256 --> 29:42.389
No. I'm glad you called.
How are you?

29:42.519 --> 29:46.393
I'm... I'm okay.

29:47.960 --> 29:49.613
Taylor, what's going on?

29:50.658 --> 29:54.227
I'm... not okay.

29:54.314 --> 29:56.055
I'm terrified.

29:56.142 --> 29:58.100
The custody hearing
isn't going well?

29:58.187 --> 30:00.189
I'm afraid
I'm going to lose Mauricio.

30:00.233 --> 30:02.583
And everything they're saying
about me, it's all true.

30:02.713 --> 30:04.890
I thought I was doing

30:04.977 --> 30:06.935
taking this job,

30:06.979 --> 30:08.894
working hard
to provide for my son,

30:08.981 --> 30:10.765
setting an example.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.854
But they're making it sound
like I'm screwing up Mauricio.

30:12.941 --> 30:14.377
I don't know. Maybe I am.

30:14.464 --> 30:15.944
No. That is complete crap.

30:16.031 --> 30:18.425
I know you.
You are a great mom.

30:18.512 --> 30:19.948
So what if you work hard?

30:19.992 --> 30:21.776
You shouldn't have
to apologize for it.

30:21.863 --> 30:23.430
No buts.

30:23.517 --> 30:26.259
Just keep fighting,
no matter how ugly it gets.

30:26.302 --> 30:28.957
It's already so much uglier
than I ever thought possible.

30:29.001 --> 30:32.352
I mean, Erik and I have had our
problems before, but this...

30:32.395 --> 30:35.137
It's the nature of trials--
inherently adversarial.

30:35.224 --> 30:37.487
It's cutthroat.

30:37.531 --> 30:39.968
It's even more painful when
you have a personal relationship

30:40.055 --> 30:41.578
with the other side.

30:41.665 --> 30:43.754
Are things getting ugly
between you and Bull?

30:43.842 --> 30:46.192
Uh, Ms. Morgan,

30:46.235 --> 30:48.542
someone just dropped off
some documents for you.

30:52.851 --> 30:54.287
Sushi or Thai?

30:54.374 --> 30:56.245
- What?
- For takeout.

30:56.332 --> 30:57.856
It's gonna be a long night,
but I think

30:57.899 --> 30:59.814
if we jump in right away,
we can get through it.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.990
Have you forgotten
about the Bolen Equity dinner?

31:02.077 --> 31:03.557
We'll have to reschedule.

31:03.644 --> 31:05.298
That's not an option.

31:05.385 --> 31:07.126
If we land this client,
it'll be huge.

31:07.213 --> 31:09.519
Dimitri is our client right now.

31:09.606 --> 31:12.218
And servicing him
should be our first priority.

31:12.305 --> 31:14.089
We took Dimitri's case pro bono.

31:14.133 --> 31:16.222
It's good for our image, but
it doesn't keep the lights on

31:16.309 --> 31:17.701
or fund my sneaker habit.

31:17.788 --> 31:19.268
Bradley, there could
be something in here

31:19.312 --> 31:20.966
that wins us the case.
We can't ignore this.

31:21.009 --> 31:23.098
Oh, come on.
Don't be naive, Marissa.

31:24.795 --> 31:26.667
Bull's playing us.

31:26.797 --> 31:28.887
He's sendi us on a snipe hunt
so that we'll stay up all night

31:28.930 --> 31:30.497
and be useless
in court tomorrow.

31:32.194 --> 31:34.370
Our firm is all
about the future.

31:34.457 --> 31:37.156
I'm gonna go win us
some new business.

31:38.200 --> 31:40.724
Are you coming or not?

31:40.855 --> 31:42.988
No.

31:55.696 --> 31:59.395
Uh, is Marissa wearing the same
dress she had on yesterday?

31:59.482 --> 32:01.180
Well, I have no idea.

32:01.223 --> 32:03.834
The bigger question is--
who's that guy with her?

32:05.140 --> 32:07.099
I found the snipe.

32:07.186 --> 32:09.275
Mr. Woods,

32:09.362 --> 32:10.711
how long have you been

32:10.798 --> 32:12.365
a structural inspector
for the city?

32:12.452 --> 32:14.280
Almost 22 years now.

32:14.323 --> 32:17.326
This is a work order for the
structural integrity inspection

32:17.370 --> 32:20.982
ordered by the city on the
Tough Penny in December 2019.

32:21.026 --> 32:22.331
Is that your name,
where it indicates

32:22.418 --> 32:23.637
the inspector
on the project?

32:23.767 --> 32:25.247
Yes, it is.

32:25.291 --> 32:27.423
- So you conducted the inspection?
- Not exactly. I mean,

32:27.510 --> 32:29.730
I began the inspection,
but I never finished it.

32:29.860 --> 32:30.731
And why is that?

32:30.861 --> 32:32.211
During the inspection,

32:32.254 --> 32:33.603
I found what looked like
a Redding Cornice.

32:33.690 --> 32:35.127
What's a Redding Cornice?

32:35.214 --> 32:37.042
It's a type of ceiling molding,

32:37.085 --> 32:39.566
but it was only used by one
Mary Stuart Redding.

32:39.609 --> 32:42.047
She was one of the first women
architects in the Northeast.

32:42.090 --> 32:44.919
Why would the discovery of this
cornice stop the inspection?

32:44.963 --> 32:47.052
It's protocol. Almost everything
Mary Stuart Redding touched

32:47.139 --> 32:49.402
is considered historical.

32:49.489 --> 32:51.491
We needed
to do a landmark review.

32:51.578 --> 32:53.014
Is that an involved process?

32:53.058 --> 32:54.276
It can take up
to three years.

32:54.363 --> 32:55.669
And while the
review's going on,

32:55.756 --> 32:56.800
you're not allowed
to touch a thing.

32:56.887 --> 32:58.367
You can't even replace a toilet

32:58.411 --> 32:59.978
without having
a committee meeting about it.

33:00.021 --> 33:01.544
So the demolition of a building

33:01.631 --> 33:03.068
with these cornices would

33:03.155 --> 33:04.156
certainly be off the table?

33:04.243 --> 33:06.288
Yes. Definitely.

33:06.332 --> 33:08.377
But a landmark review was
never conducted. Why is that?

33:08.464 --> 33:10.031
I was told
to drop the whole damn thing.

33:10.075 --> 33:13.121
My inspection, notifying
the landmark committee,

33:13.208 --> 33:14.122
all of it.

33:14.209 --> 33:15.602
Who told you to stop?

33:15.732 --> 33:17.256
She did.

33:17.343 --> 33:19.084
Councilwoman Nash.

33:19.171 --> 33:21.260
Did she tell you why?

33:21.347 --> 33:24.132
No. The next thing I knew,

33:24.176 --> 33:26.482
they announced
this Tech Hub project.

33:26.569 --> 33:28.615
Thank you.

33:28.702 --> 33:30.182
No further questions,
Your Honor.

33:30.225 --> 33:33.446
It looks like that nothing
was a something after all.

33:36.797 --> 33:40.496
"We the jury find for
the plaintiff, Dimitri Gillard,

33:40.583 --> 33:43.369
"that the actions
of the New York City Council

33:43.456 --> 33:45.066
"and Thomas Krenell
were fraudulent

33:45.110 --> 33:48.635
according to the laws
of the state of New York."

33:49.636 --> 33:52.117
- Oh.
- Thank you so much.

33:52.160 --> 33:54.815
We'd, uh, better wrap it up
if we're gonna make it

33:54.902 --> 33:56.382
- on time. Yeah.
- All right.

33:57.731 --> 33:59.907
Thank you.

34:17.272 --> 34:18.404
All rise.

34:20.797 --> 34:22.538
Court is now in session.

34:31.330 --> 34:35.116
Good afternoon. In the case

34:35.160 --> 34:37.466
of <i>Rentzel v. Rentzel,</i>
I have reached a decision.

34:37.553 --> 34:40.121
It is the State of New York's
strong preference

34:40.165 --> 34:42.602
to allow parents to retain
their custodial rights

34:42.689 --> 34:45.126
whenever possible.

34:45.170 --> 34:47.650
Unfortunately,
having Mauricio spend

34:47.737 --> 34:49.913
half the year in school
in New York and the other half

34:50.000 --> 34:52.742
in Hawaii is simply
not practical. Therefore,

34:52.873 --> 34:54.657
the current 50-50

34:54.744 --> 34:56.964
custody arrangement
cannot continue.

34:57.051 --> 35:00.707
Given Mr. Rentzel's
superior support network

35:00.794 --> 35:02.926
and the troubling questions

35:03.013 --> 35:04.798
surrounding Ms. Rentzel's ability

35:04.885 --> 35:07.583
to care for
and protect this child,

35:07.670 --> 35:10.108
I find it is
in Mauricio's best interest

35:10.151 --> 35:12.327
to grant full legal
and physical custody

35:12.414 --> 35:14.938
to Mr. Rentzel.

They want
to maintain custodial rights.

35:44.838 --> 35:49.190
The important thing is that
we are gonna keep fighting.

35:49.234 --> 35:52.280
This isn't over,
not by a long shot.

35:52.324 --> 35:55.153
I need to pick up Mauricio
from the babysitter.

35:55.196 --> 35:57.285
I can't let him
see me like this.

35:59.766 --> 36:01.855
I don't want him to be scared.

36:01.942 --> 36:03.552
I'll be right back.

36:15.173 --> 36:16.478
You know, for a man

36:16.565 --> 36:17.784
who just got
everything he wanted,

36:17.871 --> 36:19.438
you look pretty miserable.

36:19.525 --> 36:21.744
I'd really like
to be alone right now.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.879
It's a funny thing
about winning, isn't it?

36:25.966 --> 36:28.273
When you're in the fight,
you'll do anything.

36:28.360 --> 36:30.536
You'll kick,
scratch, claw...

36:30.623 --> 36:32.494
bite.

36:32.581 --> 36:33.626
Anything...

36:33.713 --> 36:35.454
to win.

36:35.541 --> 36:37.195
And you just get so

36:37.238 --> 36:39.371
fixated on it
that you never stop to ask

36:39.458 --> 36:41.503
why...

36:42.722 --> 36:44.985
...why...

36:45.115 --> 36:47.553
do we want it so bad?

36:48.858 --> 36:51.165
And was it worth it?

36:54.516 --> 36:56.562
So was it?

37:02.742 --> 37:04.744
You can't take him from me yet.
It's still my day.

37:04.831 --> 37:06.485
Hey, wait! Wait!
I need to talk to you.

37:06.528 --> 37:08.617
- You've said enough.
- You were right! You were right.

37:10.228 --> 37:12.882
I think a small part of me
was doing all this to hurt you.

37:13.013 --> 37:15.015
My God, Erik.

37:15.102 --> 37:17.539
But that is because
you hurt me, too.

37:17.626 --> 37:20.412
When we got back together,
it was not

37:20.499 --> 37:22.022
just for fun
or a distraction.

37:22.152 --> 37:23.545
I thought maybe...

37:23.632 --> 37:25.330
Anyway...

37:25.417 --> 37:26.505
that's not why I'm here.

37:26.592 --> 37:28.420
Why are you here?

37:30.291 --> 37:32.380
Do you remember the...

37:32.424 --> 37:34.600
yellow blanket
with the giraffes Mauricio used

37:34.687 --> 37:36.558
to drag around
with him everywhere?

37:36.645 --> 37:38.517
What does that have
to do with anything?

37:38.604 --> 37:40.562
He loved that blanket.

37:40.606 --> 37:42.434
And one day, when I took him
to the zoo,

37:42.521 --> 37:44.523
he insisted on bringing it.

37:44.610 --> 37:46.394
But on the way home,
he fell asleep,

37:46.438 --> 37:49.267
and I forgot it on the subway.
He cried for hours.

37:49.310 --> 37:51.399
He wouldn't eat,
he wouldn't sleep.

37:51.443 --> 37:53.619
So then you came over
to talk to him.

37:54.620 --> 37:57.187
Five minutes later,
he was quiet.

38:00.452 --> 38:02.323
Yeah. I remember that.

38:02.410 --> 38:03.716
Well, I peeked into his room.

38:03.803 --> 38:06.022
And... there you were

38:06.109 --> 38:08.155
holding his hand
while he slept.

38:10.375 --> 38:12.159
Mauricio looked so peaceful.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.117
And...

38:14.248 --> 38:16.163
in my gut, I knew why.

38:17.904 --> 38:20.994
Because you are his real
security blanket, Taylor.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.563
Nothing else
comes close.

38:25.825 --> 38:28.436
I want to be with Mauricio
more than anything, but...

38:30.699 --> 38:33.572
I love him too much
to take him away from you.

38:33.659 --> 38:36.226
What are you saying?

38:38.098 --> 38:40.753
Erik is granting you
primary custody?

38:40.840 --> 38:42.581
I know. It's crazy.

38:42.624 --> 38:44.800
He'll still have Mauricio in
Hawaii for summers and holidays.

38:44.887 --> 38:46.715
We're gonna figure out a way
to make it work.

38:46.802 --> 38:49.022
I am so, so happy for you.

38:49.109 --> 38:51.111
And it's the right thing.

38:51.198 --> 38:54.984
Did Erik mention why he had
this big change of heart?

38:55.071 --> 38:56.551
Honestly, I have no clue.

38:56.638 --> 38:58.988
I just... thank God he did.

38:59.119 --> 39:00.947
Yeah.

39:01.034 --> 39:02.470
Oh, it's getting late.

39:02.514 --> 39:03.993
I promised Mauricio I'd take him
over to the park.

39:04.080 --> 39:06.474
Of course, go!
I-I'll talk to you later.

39:07.997 --> 39:11.131
I doubt we'd have won
without that aborted inspection.

39:12.350 --> 39:13.699
I can't believe
Bull turned it over.

39:13.786 --> 39:16.310
- What do you mean?
- Well, if it were me,

39:16.354 --> 39:18.617
I'd have buried it so deep,
no one would've ever found it.

39:18.660 --> 39:21.620
Even if you thought it fell
within the discovery requests?

39:21.707 --> 39:23.622
I don't understand the question.

39:23.709 --> 39:25.624
It would have been
an ethics violation.

39:25.711 --> 39:28.235
If a tree falls in the woods...

39:28.322 --> 39:30.193
I'm gonna squeeze
in a workout before dinner.

39:30.324 --> 39:31.543
See you tomorrow.

39:31.630 --> 39:33.588
See you tomorrow.

39:50.170 --> 39:52.564
- Hey.
- Oh, uh, sorry.

39:52.651 --> 39:54.653
I still had my key.

39:54.740 --> 39:57.177
So I let myself in.

39:57.264 --> 39:59.222
I have been saying
we should change those locks.

39:59.309 --> 40:01.486
I was on my way
to my office,

40:01.529 --> 40:04.445
and I suddenly had a
craving for TAC's coffee.

40:04.489 --> 40:06.186
It's understandable,
because it is

40:06.273 --> 40:08.231
the very best coffee
in the world.

40:08.318 --> 40:10.669
I know what you
did for Taylor.

40:10.756 --> 40:12.758
Oh, come on.

40:12.845 --> 40:14.847
I gave a little nudge,
that's all.

40:14.934 --> 40:16.849
Yeah, well, that
nudge changed her life.

40:16.936 --> 40:19.068
And I was wrong.

40:19.155 --> 40:20.896
The other day
at the courthouse.

40:20.940 --> 40:23.812
Oh, I don't know about that--No, no, no. Let me finish.

40:23.899 --> 40:26.162
You're exactly the person
I thought you were.

40:26.249 --> 40:29.557
When your people need you
most, you're always there.

40:29.644 --> 40:31.777
Let's not get carried away.

40:31.820 --> 40:33.822
You know, the other night,
when I was going through

40:33.866 --> 40:36.521
that truckload of documents
that you dumped on me?

40:36.608 --> 40:38.610
I was alone.

40:38.653 --> 40:40.263
Bradley thought
it was beneath him.

40:40.394 --> 40:41.613
Oh.

40:41.656 --> 40:42.788
But you would've
been there with me.

40:42.875 --> 40:44.354
Or at the very least

40:44.442 --> 40:46.487
Danny would've been...
or Taylor.

40:46.574 --> 40:49.142
Having your name on the door

40:49.229 --> 40:51.187
doesn't mean much
if it doesn't feel like home

40:51.274 --> 40:53.233
when you walk inside.

40:54.974 --> 40:57.237
So, did you mean it

40:57.324 --> 40:59.152
when you said
that we could be partners?

40:59.282 --> 41:01.197
True partners?

41:01.328 --> 41:03.635
Absolutely.

41:03.678 --> 41:06.768
Then I guess there's only
one thing left for us to do.

41:06.855 --> 41:08.117
What's that?

41:08.248 --> 41:09.641
To us.
Oh!

41:09.728 --> 41:11.599
Before we, uh...

41:11.643 --> 41:13.558
toast, can I--?
Can we switch mugs?

41:13.645 --> 41:15.124
- What?
- Well, it's just--

41:15.211 --> 41:17.692
- This is my mug, sorry.
- Oh, I'm sorry, I thought

41:17.736 --> 41:19.825
we were partners-- what's
- yours is mine kind of thing.
- Yeah.

41:19.912 --> 41:21.479
It's just my mug.
It's because it's--

41:21.566 --> 41:23.306
This is my...

41:23.437 --> 41:24.917
Happy?

41:25.047 --> 41:26.309
Thrilled.
