30:42.579 --> 30:44.451
So many girls can
take my place.

30:44.494 --> 30:46.409
No, he's smart. He knows
you're better than them.

30:46.453 --> 30:47.541
You're a real woman.

30:47.584 --> 30:50.326
A woman of her own will,
her own desire.

30:50.370 --> 30:51.806
You know what I am.

30:51.850 --> 30:55.070
In this world, sister,
we are all prostitutes.

30:55.114 --> 30:57.246
You are a queen.

30:57.290 --> 30:59.858
[door opening]MAN:
Wow.

31:01.207 --> 31:02.382
Shh.

31:02.425 --> 31:07.474
[men speaking Spanish]

31:47.601 --> 31:49.516
[speaking Spanish]

31:51.257 --> 31:52.954
Whose cell is that?

31:52.998 --> 31:54.608
In the corner?

31:57.393 --> 31:59.526
Is that your cell?

32:07.447 --> 32:10.276
[man screams]

32:10.319 --> 32:12.452
You! Is that your cell?

32:12.495 --> 32:13.322
It's mine!

32:13.366 --> 32:14.584
It's mine.

32:16.847 --> 32:19.067
It's mine.

32:24.377 --> 32:27.423
I found this.

32:27.467 --> 32:30.035
It's not a weapon.

32:30.861 --> 32:32.994
[grunts]

32:33.038 --> 32:35.040
I know what it is.

32:40.436 --> 32:42.569
Why were you watching me?

32:59.455 --> 33:01.501
I'm going to ask you

33:01.544 --> 33:02.763
one more time.

33:02.806 --> 33:05.026
Why were you watching me?

33:05.070 --> 33:07.028
I wasn't watching you.

33:07.072 --> 33:09.422
I saw you.

33:09.465 --> 33:11.380
Answer the question!I don't know what
you think you saw,

33:11.424 --> 33:13.600
but I wasn't watching you.Cinco.

33:15.123 --> 33:16.516
Cinco.
I wasn't

33:16.559 --> 33:17.952
watching you.
Cuatro.

33:22.087 --> 33:23.479
Tres!

33:23.523 --> 33:26.004
It's mine!

33:31.487 --> 33:33.011
Why were you watching him?

33:34.273 --> 33:36.449
I... I wasn't. I was, uh...

33:37.798 --> 33:40.540
I was watching birds.

33:40.583 --> 33:43.325
Yes.

33:43.369 --> 33:45.501
Yes.

33:49.331 --> 33:51.507
See?

34:02.562 --> 34:04.477
Why did you
not speak up

34:04.520 --> 34:06.392
before?

34:06.435 --> 34:07.741
I, uh...

34:12.659 --> 34:14.487
I was scared.

34:18.012 --> 34:19.405
I was scared.

34:23.191 --> 34:26.716
Hurtado! Ya. Dejelo.

34:58.183 --> 35:02.491
[whimpers softly]

35:02.535 --> 35:04.493
Come on.

35:04.537 --> 35:07.496
Come on!

35:07.540 --> 35:09.498
Please, please, please.

35:09.542 --> 35:10.586
Come on.

35:28.517 --> 35:31.172
He's coming back up here.

35:31.216 --> 35:32.565
Now, don't worry.

35:32.608 --> 35:34.393
It's all going to be okay.

35:35.307 --> 35:38.223
You have a little mascara
right there.

35:42.575 --> 35:45.578
You need to look pretty
for Lechero.

35:49.712 --> 35:51.714
Thank you.

35:53.412 --> 35:55.718
Wait right here.

36:02.551 --> 36:04.031
A patrol passed through,
but they didn't stay.

36:04.074 --> 36:05.598
Knocked some things
over then walked away.

36:05.641 --> 36:07.730
I hid your woman
in a safe place,

36:07.774 --> 36:08.905
but I'd be lying

36:08.949 --> 36:10.690
if I didn't say it
was a close call.

36:10.733 --> 36:12.126
Is she alone?

36:12.170 --> 36:14.172
Yeah.

36:19.742 --> 36:22.397
Hey.

36:22.441 --> 36:24.747
Don't be afraid.

36:24.791 --> 36:26.749
No, no, my dear.

36:26.793 --> 36:28.490
They're gone.

36:28.534 --> 36:30.579
I should go, too.

36:30.623 --> 36:31.972
No, no, no.
What's the rush?

36:32.015 --> 36:33.539
Come on.No, I should

36:33.582 --> 36:35.454
get home.

36:40.285 --> 36:43.244
I gave her the money.

36:43.288 --> 36:45.246
I was going to
replace it myself

36:45.290 --> 36:46.813
at the end of the day,
when I get my cut.

36:46.856 --> 36:48.467
I just didn't get a chance
to tell you.

36:48.510 --> 36:49.642
She had no money
to get home.

36:49.685 --> 36:51.731
Is this true?

36:51.774 --> 36:53.298
Yes.

36:53.341 --> 36:55.430
With all due respect.

36:55.474 --> 36:58.520
Surely you don't want your
mistress travelin' broke.

36:58.564 --> 37:00.043
She'd end up in a taxi

37:00.087 --> 37:02.524
with no way to pay
the cab fare.

37:02.568 --> 37:03.699
[sucks through teeth]

37:03.743 --> 37:05.962
Ah, you did this?

37:06.006 --> 37:07.268
For me?

37:07.312 --> 37:09.227
Si, patrón.

37:09.270 --> 37:11.925
Teodoro.

37:11.968 --> 37:14.101
The one
that does all

37:14.144 --> 37:16.190
the useful things for me, huh?

37:16.234 --> 37:19.759
And now you do the thinking
for me.

37:19.802 --> 37:22.283
No, no, it's not
like that, patrón--

37:22.327 --> 37:23.850
[grunts]

37:25.068 --> 37:28.463
[gags]

37:28.507 --> 37:31.118
Get the bucket.

37:31.161 --> 37:31.945
Wash my feet.

37:33.163 --> 37:35.209
[gasps]

37:41.955 --> 37:44.392
So what do we do now?

37:44.436 --> 37:46.742
I don't know.

37:46.786 --> 37:48.222
Well, I'm afraid
that's not good enough.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.485
Please just give me
a moment to think.

37:50.529 --> 37:52.182
Wasting time is not an
option for me, Michael.

37:52.226 --> 37:54.272
I need to be out
of here by tomorrow.

37:54.315 --> 37:56.361
I know, just in time for
your next fishing trip,

37:56.404 --> 37:57.362
or is it a bird-watching trip?
I forget.

37:57.405 --> 37:59.494
That's my trip log,
I've told you.

37:59.538 --> 38:01.453
I need to
retrace my steps.

38:01.496 --> 38:03.324
I'm doing everything
they tell me, the same
thing you are.

38:03.368 --> 38:06.196
Just, just leave me
alone, please.

38:06.240 --> 38:08.721
You know, before
I was arrested,

38:08.764 --> 38:11.376
a man came to my flat
and took my addresses.

38:11.419 --> 38:13.552
They know the name
of everyone I care about

38:13.595 --> 38:15.728
and how to find them.

38:15.771 --> 38:19.862
Well, they already found
everyone I care about. Okay?

38:20.950 --> 38:23.649
If you can't get me
out of here, tell me now,

38:23.692 --> 38:25.738
because time
is running out.

38:26.652 --> 38:28.001
Huh?!

38:35.400 --> 38:37.750
[panting]

38:45.888 --> 38:49.022
Look, it's hot today.

38:49.065 --> 38:50.719
Yeah.

38:50.763 --> 38:53.766
Prefer the heat
than the cold any day.

38:53.809 --> 38:56.377
You know my brother
and I wanted to come

38:56.421 --> 38:57.770
down here to Panama

38:57.813 --> 39:00.555
and start a dive shop
like the one we were at today.

39:00.599 --> 39:03.602
My boy, he was gonna
leave school and help us

39:03.645 --> 39:05.865
start the family business.

39:05.908 --> 39:08.650
When this is all over,
why don't you do it?

39:10.652 --> 39:12.611
Too much bad stuff's happened.

39:12.654 --> 39:15.701
Still, you can make it work.

39:15.744 --> 39:18.834
It's only gonna work if...
if Whistler cooperates.

39:18.878 --> 39:21.010
If he plays games,
people get hurt.

39:21.054 --> 39:23.056
You understand that, right?

39:23.099 --> 39:27.016
He doesn't want anyone
to get hurt.

39:27.060 --> 39:29.062
I hope you're right.

39:29.105 --> 39:31.369
I want to show you something.

39:38.898 --> 39:40.595
[clattering]

39:40.639 --> 39:42.336
Our getaway vehicle.

39:42.380 --> 39:44.643
Now,

39:44.686 --> 39:47.776
the next time you see him,

39:47.820 --> 39:51.432
I want you to tell him
what you saw.

39:51.476 --> 39:55.044
Tell him we're all in this
together.

39:55.088 --> 39:56.437
We're part of a team.

39:56.481 --> 39:57.786
You understand?

39:57.830 --> 39:59.701
Okay. Yeah.

39:59.745 --> 40:00.746
All right,
get up.

40:00.789 --> 40:02.661
Oh.

40:04.750 --> 40:06.186
We're coming back.

40:06.229 --> 40:07.274
Okay.

40:07.317 --> 40:09.363
No, this way.

40:10.582 --> 40:12.453
What?
This way, come on.

40:12.497 --> 40:13.541
Okay.

40:21.636 --> 40:23.638
If all goes well,

40:23.682 --> 40:25.684
we'll see them
tomorrow.

40:34.997 --> 40:36.738
[car horn honking]

40:50.448 --> 40:51.884
[both chuckle]

40:53.973 --> 40:56.802
No, no, no, no, no.

41:30.096 --> 41:32.098
MICHAEL:
If we're gonna
do this today,

41:32.141 --> 41:34.013
we got to replace
everything we lost.

41:34.056 --> 41:35.449
Like what?

41:35.493 --> 41:37.146
For starters,
a new exit point.

41:37.190 --> 41:38.626
It's got to be on the south
side of the building.

41:38.670 --> 41:41.324
Look at this guy,
again.

41:41.368 --> 41:42.978
Hey! Hey!

41:43.022 --> 41:44.110
I know you, huh?

41:44.153 --> 41:46.068
Afraid not.Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:46.112 --> 41:50.464
You're McFadden, right?

41:50.508 --> 41:52.466
Nice, 1997?

41:52.510 --> 41:53.511
Sorry.

41:53.554 --> 41:54.947
You've confused me
with someone else.

41:54.990 --> 41:56.383
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I swear.

41:56.426 --> 41:57.993
You were with the ambassador.

42:00.169 --> 42:01.997
You've mistaken me
for someone else.

42:16.142 --> 42:18.623
That chap's insane.
The heat must be getting to him.

42:22.104 --> 42:24.542
Come on, guys, I got
something to show you.

42:27.893 --> 42:31.026
I'm sure I didn't observe
the guards' behavior

42:31.070 --> 42:33.028
in as much detail
as you guys,

42:33.072 --> 42:35.683
but I did notice
something yesterday.

42:35.727 --> 42:38.686
Right around this time.

42:41.123 --> 42:42.647
That's the day shift.

42:42.690 --> 42:44.083
They start up at 6:00.

42:44.126 --> 42:45.650
Just keep looking,
keep looking.

42:49.044 --> 42:50.568
There.

42:59.533 --> 43:01.056
Where'd you get your cup, Alex?

43:01.100 --> 43:03.668
I got it in the courtyard,
but apparently it's from him.

43:03.711 --> 43:05.844
He has one in the morning
and one after lunch.

43:06.801 --> 43:08.586
Man's got to have his fix.

43:10.718 --> 43:12.590
If we get to that cup...

43:12.633 --> 43:13.678
We get to the man.

43:15.636 --> 43:17.290
We got to move.
