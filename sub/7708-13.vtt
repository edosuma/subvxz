WEBVTT

00:03.270 --> 00:06.772
- Oh, wow.
- What are you looking at?

00:06.774 --> 00:10.609
The pictures of the surface of
Neptune seen from Voyager 2.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.211
Oh, let me see.

00:14.715 --> 00:17.483
Well, the place looks
undeveloped.

00:17.485 --> 00:18.917
It is.

00:18.919 --> 00:20.819
Well, that's the last time
I buy property

00:20.821 --> 00:23.956
without visiting it first.

00:23.958 --> 00:27.059
Can't you find something else
to do?

00:27.061 --> 00:30.863
Well, right now, I'm living
up to my full potential.

00:30.865 --> 00:33.432
- Oh, no.
- What is it, hon?

00:33.434 --> 00:36.835
We got another dinner party
invitation.

00:36.837 --> 00:39.772
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

00:39.774 --> 00:42.441
- We like the Andersons too.
- Yeah.

00:42.443 --> 00:44.777
Willie, if it's a date thing,
I'll go.

00:44.779 --> 00:47.079
I'll throw on one of Kate's
cheap dresses.

00:47.081 --> 00:48.580
They'll never know.

00:51.285 --> 00:53.786
I feel bad that we're constantly
invited to parties

00:53.788 --> 00:56.155
and can't return the favors.

00:56.157 --> 00:59.691
Well, if you would tidy up
around here once in a while

00:59.693 --> 01:02.394
you wouldn't be so embarrassed
to have people over.

01:04.365 --> 01:06.999
Remember the good old days when
we used to, uh,

01:07.001 --> 01:09.802
go over to other people's houses
and accept their hospitality

01:09.804 --> 01:12.171
and we'd say,
"Next week at our place"

01:12.173 --> 01:14.339
and then we'd actually do it?

01:14.341 --> 01:16.842
How naive of us to think that
an alien wouldn't come along

01:16.844 --> 01:20.279
and alter our lives forever.

01:20.281 --> 01:22.848
Ain't life funny?

01:22.850 --> 01:27.219
Oh, what the heck, Kate?
Let's throw a party.

01:27.221 --> 01:30.489
Oh, I don't know, Willie.
What about you-know-who?

01:30.491 --> 01:34.059
Brian? Don't worry.
I'll have a talk with him.

01:35.096 --> 01:38.097
[theme music]

02:09.930 --> 02:11.930
[music continues]

02:36.790 --> 02:37.856
[instrumental music]

02:39.793 --> 02:42.628
Now, before we discuss food,
we must first plan a theme

02:42.630 --> 02:44.263
for your party.
Have you thought of one?

02:44.265 --> 02:47.599
Well, uh, what would you
suggest, Mr. Savage?

02:47.601 --> 02:50.235
Well, let's see. This is a
make-good party, am I right?

02:50.237 --> 02:51.603
You really don't want to have it

02:51.605 --> 02:54.106
but you feel you must. Correct?

02:54.108 --> 02:55.407
[phone ringing]

02:55.409 --> 02:59.044
Well, yeah. But, uh that..

02:59.046 --> 03:00.846
That's not really a theme,
is it?

03:00.848 --> 03:03.148
Well, it's been done.

03:03.150 --> 03:06.618
- Hello?
- Make it a luau.

03:06.620 --> 03:10.289
- ALF? Where are you?
- In the kitchen.

03:10.291 --> 03:11.657
Did you know
there's a number you can dial

03:11.659 --> 03:14.560
that makes your own phone ring?
Groovy, huh?

03:16.096 --> 03:17.763
What do you want?

03:17.765 --> 03:21.233
Be smart, Willie. Think luau.

03:25.940 --> 03:29.274
[sighs]
Sorry. Wrong number.

03:29.276 --> 03:33.812
Uh, ahem, however,
just out of curiosity, um

03:33.814 --> 03:36.281
what would you think about
having a luau?

03:36.283 --> 03:38.317
- That's perfect.
- Really? You think so?

03:38.319 --> 03:41.420
Oh, sure. Luaus are cheap,
lots of poi, pineapple

03:41.422 --> 03:43.655
tiki torches, Don Ho music.

03:43.657 --> 03:47.893
And I think we could probably
squeeze by with just one pig.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.127
[phone rings]

03:51.098 --> 03:54.132
- Yes?
- Two pigs.

03:56.837 --> 03:59.371
- What now?
- Oh, nothing.

03:59.373 --> 04:03.275
Another wrong number.
It's a regular epidemic.

04:05.879 --> 04:08.847
However, a question has come up.

04:08.849 --> 04:11.617
Do you think
one pig would be enough?

04:11.619 --> 04:15.354
Well, that depends on the pig.

04:15.356 --> 04:18.323
Well, uh,
what do you think, honey?

04:18.325 --> 04:21.560
- Hey, let's go for it.
- Well, fine, Mr. Savage.

04:21.562 --> 04:24.029
- We'll go with the luau idea.
- Perfect.

04:24.031 --> 04:27.099
Leave everything to me,
by this time next Saturday night

04:27.101 --> 04:32.404
you'll think you've just died
and gone to Maui.<i> Aloha.</i>

04:32.406 --> 04:34.006
Ha, bye, bye.

04:34.008 --> 04:36.041
[both laugh]

04:36.043 --> 04:39.711
¶ Oh we're going to a hukilau ¶

04:39.713 --> 04:44.082
¶ Huki huki huki huki
huki hukilau ¶¶

04:44.084 --> 04:47.352
I wanna thank you in advance
for your cooperation

04:47.354 --> 04:49.755
while we're giving our party.

04:49.757 --> 04:52.557
Sure. What do you want me to do?

04:52.559 --> 04:54.559
Not come.

04:54.561 --> 04:58.964
I think Mother Teresa put it
best when she said

04:58.966 --> 05:02.501
"You scratch my back,
I scratch yours."

05:02.503 --> 05:05.037
Which, loosely translated,
means--

05:05.039 --> 05:08.307
- I know what that means.
- It's happening.

05:08.309 --> 05:10.742
He's going to ruin everything.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.778
Well, that's up to you,
isn't it?

05:12.780 --> 05:15.447
My cooperation can be bought

05:15.449 --> 05:21.219
if you agree to the following
harsh and unreasonable demands..

05:21.221 --> 05:27.292
One, I want my subscription
to the Village Voice renewed.

05:27.294 --> 05:29.528
We can do that.

05:29.530 --> 05:32.898
Two, I want the ozone layer
restored.

05:34.468 --> 05:37.536
ALF, we can't do that
by Saturday.

05:39.039 --> 05:42.107
Alright, fine.
That was just a bargaining chip.

05:42.109 --> 05:48.080
Three, I get all leftovers,
including what's in the trash.

05:48.082 --> 05:51.583
This area is not negotiable.

05:51.585 --> 05:54.052
[sighs]
ALF, can't you just for once

05:54.054 --> 05:58.557
do something for no other reason
than that we asked you?

05:58.559 --> 06:00.192
[laughing]

06:02.396 --> 06:05.464
Oh, that's a good one.
So do we have a deal?

06:07.468 --> 06:09.267
I'll tell you what we'll do.

06:09.269 --> 06:11.803
If you agree to stay up
in the attic and be quiet

06:11.805 --> 06:14.506
while we're having our party,
then you can have two hours

06:14.508 --> 06:17.743
to forage
and devour the carcass.

06:17.745 --> 06:22.547
You're a just, fair, honorable
man. Let's shake on it.

06:25.719 --> 06:29.488
Oh, I saw that on Webster once.
Cracked me up.

06:31.859 --> 06:34.359
[instrumental music]

06:37.731 --> 06:41.833
So, Willie, got any big plans
for this weekend?

06:41.835 --> 06:44.770
Well, no, no, not really.
Uh, no, Delores.

06:44.772 --> 06:47.339
- Any-any reason you ask?
- No.

06:47.341 --> 06:50.342
Oh, by the way,
your caterer called.

06:50.344 --> 06:53.145
He said everything's set
for the big luau.

06:53.147 --> 06:56.381
Well, have a nice day.

06:56.383 --> 06:59.017
Oh, you mean besides that. Uh--

06:59.019 --> 07:02.020
Yeah, Kate and I are having
a-a small gathering

07:02.022 --> 07:04.589
for, uh, people
we have obligations to.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.558
Oh, I see.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.393
What about when I drove you home
that time and gave you

07:08.395 --> 07:09.961
a coke and a cracker?

07:12.733 --> 07:15.300
How could that have slipped my
mind?

07:15.302 --> 07:18.770
You're having a party? Ha.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.505
You never invite people
to your house.

07:20.507 --> 07:21.740
What is this, a sick joke?

07:21.742 --> 07:24.676
That's what I thought at first.

07:24.678 --> 07:28.447
Uh, like I was telling Delores
uh, we are having a,

07:28.449 --> 07:31.349
uh, gathering
to pay back some social debts

07:31.351 --> 07:33.785
that we have to people who've
invited us to their parties.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.854
Oh, you mean like the party
we threw for your birthday

07:35.856 --> 07:39.157
with the white cake and punch
that everyone chipped in on?

07:42.763 --> 07:45.096
That was a good cake.

07:45.098 --> 07:48.099
Alright, ha, ha. Everybody.

07:48.101 --> 07:50.902
Everybody's invited.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.771
Is that because
you really want us

07:52.773 --> 07:55.974
or because you're embarrassed
and on the spot?

07:55.976 --> 07:58.276
- Does it matter?
- Not to me.

07:58.278 --> 08:02.814
Guess what, everybody,
Willie's having a party.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.749
- 'What?'
- 'Run that by me again.'

08:04.751 --> 08:06.318
(male #1)
'What's the punch line?'

08:08.755 --> 08:11.256
[instrumental music]

08:18.198 --> 08:20.732
Lynnie, I don't like the looks
of these clouds.

08:20.734 --> 08:23.768
Mom, will you relax? There was
nothing on the weather report.

08:23.770 --> 08:26.471
Oh, just think, people are
actually going to be able to say

08:26.473 --> 08:28.707
they've been to our house.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.877
Doesn't take much to get us
excited anymore, does it?

08:35.816 --> 08:38.149
[sniffing]

08:38.151 --> 08:42.621
Agh, that pig aroma
is driving me crazy.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.789
I think it looks gross.

08:44.791 --> 08:48.793
Good. Go down and tell that
to the other guests.

08:48.795 --> 08:51.596
Mom told me you might go
a little crazy tonight.

08:53.166 --> 08:55.734
Is undressing pork
with your eyes crazy?

08:58.639 --> 09:02.774
Look at those vultures down
there hovering over my pig.

09:02.776 --> 09:05.243
That's what you get
for inviting civil servants.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.547
Get away from the pig.

09:11.184 --> 09:13.752
- Lovely party so far, yes?
- Very.

09:13.754 --> 09:16.021
Uh, but how is the pig coming?

09:16.023 --> 09:19.558
Slow. They're hard to judge.
No two pigs are alike, you know.

09:21.395 --> 09:25.030
Uh, Rex, there's a call for you.
Someone named James.

09:25.032 --> 09:27.198
He said it was important.

09:27.200 --> 09:31.069
James, yes. That's my, uh,
ahem, pastry chef.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.437
Can I take this in the bedroom?

09:32.439 --> 09:33.538
Sure.

09:37.444 --> 09:39.878
Raquel, Trevor,
glad you could come.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.813
- How you doing?
- Our pleasure.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.348
Trevor thought
you were playing a trick on us

09:43.350 --> 09:44.883
when we got our invitation.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.318
[Trevor laughs]

09:46.320 --> 09:50.021
Oh, Trevor, look, a whole pig.

09:50.023 --> 09:52.624
I told you
they leave the face on.

09:52.626 --> 09:56.494
- Ah, Tanner.
- Hello, Mr. Rasmussen.

09:56.496 --> 09:58.797
I hope you don't mind,
I brought my son, Julius.

09:58.799 --> 10:01.900
He just bought himself
a small BMW.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.668
Isn't that nice?

10:03.670 --> 10:05.403
- You remember Kate.
- Good to see you.

10:05.405 --> 10:07.038
- Hello.
- This is my daughter, Lynn.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.040
- Hi. It's nice to meet you.
- Hello.

10:09.042 --> 10:12.644
I haven't been to a party since
my dad took me to the last one.

10:12.646 --> 10:16.014
Oh, is that right?

10:16.016 --> 10:18.850
Ahem, I-I think we should leave
these two kids alone.

10:22.556 --> 10:24.456
[exhales]

10:24.458 --> 10:27.726
You seem to have something
stuck on your shirt.

10:27.728 --> 10:31.663
Oh, it's wax.
It's been a madhouse at work.

10:31.665 --> 10:34.099
Oh, you work with wax.
Are you a sculptor?

10:34.101 --> 10:36.434
In a way. I'm a mortician.

10:38.405 --> 10:40.071
That's interesting.

10:40.073 --> 10:43.141
Oh, not always,
but today was a good day.

10:43.143 --> 10:47.445
A tour bus tried to outrun
a train. Not even close.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.648
So can I get you something
to eat?

10:53.286 --> 10:55.387
Willie? Willie,
who are those people?

10:55.389 --> 11:00.025
Oh, that's our Xerox repairman
and, uh, that's his wife, um.

11:00.027 --> 11:03.662
Uh.. Ah, who cares?

11:03.664 --> 11:06.064
Willie, I'm worried we're not
gonna have enough food.

11:06.066 --> 11:08.767
Oh, Rex, is it too late
to order another pig?

11:08.769 --> 11:12.003
Grab hold, Mrs. Tanner.
Pigs don't grow on trees.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.939
Besides, one will go much
further than you think

11:14.941 --> 11:18.677
trust me. I love this outfit.
Both of you.

11:21.148 --> 11:23.381
Oh, come on, Kate.

11:23.383 --> 11:26.217
We've been looking forward to
this for four years.

11:26.219 --> 11:28.987
Besides, look around.
People seem to be happy enough.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.488
Yeah, I guess you're right.

11:30.490 --> 11:32.323
Oh, I'm gonna go say hi
to your janitor.

11:32.325 --> 11:34.159
[thunder rumbling]

11:42.302 --> 11:46.371
Oh, no!
Raindrops are falling on my pig!

11:50.711 --> 11:52.744
[instrumental music]

11:58.919 --> 12:02.153
I just wanted to have a party.
Was that so wrong?

12:02.155 --> 12:05.056
Oh. Is the pig
gonna be alright?

12:05.058 --> 12:07.025
The pig is dead. Accept it.

12:07.027 --> 12:10.028
Well, just do what you can,
okay?

12:10.030 --> 12:12.797
Had you thought of any
contingency plans?

12:12.799 --> 12:14.833
Well, let's see,
some of the guests were talking

12:14.835 --> 12:17.168
about going to a movie later.

12:17.170 --> 12:20.572
But if you like, I suppose
I could have my assistant

12:20.574 --> 12:22.307
entertain for the crowd.

12:22.309 --> 12:25.744
Fine. Yeah, fine. Go ahead.

12:25.746 --> 12:30.515
Did you know that when we bury
people, we wire their jaws shut

12:30.517 --> 12:34.652
and use plastic clips
to keep their eyes closed?

12:34.654 --> 12:37.021
But I go on.

12:37.023 --> 12:39.023
[sighs]
I'm sorry.

12:39.025 --> 12:42.127
People tell me I shouldn't take
my work home with me.

12:42.129 --> 12:45.997
[laughing]

12:45.999 --> 12:47.766
Gotcha.

12:50.270 --> 12:53.404
It looks like your daughter
is taken with my son.

12:53.406 --> 12:56.040
Well, this is his second party,
you know.

12:56.042 --> 12:59.444
Really? I would've guessed
twice that.

13:02.682 --> 13:05.350
Robert.

13:05.352 --> 13:08.253
You're on, kid. You're going out
there a caterer's assistant

13:08.255 --> 13:10.388
but you're coming back a star.

13:12.192 --> 13:13.725
[instrumental music]

13:13.727 --> 13:16.494
You can't do that in this house.
Are you crazy?

13:16.496 --> 13:19.631
Oh, come on, Tanner.
Didn't you ever have a dream?

13:21.368 --> 13:24.135
Listen, I've had some experience
with fire in this house.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.571
I know what the limits are.

13:26.573 --> 13:30.341
- You-you've gotta put that out.
- Aww.

13:32.412 --> 13:34.345
Very well. Fine, fine.

13:34.347 --> 13:38.016
I guess my crying time will just
come a little early tonight.

13:46.126 --> 13:47.358
[sighs]

13:53.567 --> 13:55.133
[ALF screams]

14:00.040 --> 14:01.306
[instrumental music]

14:03.009 --> 14:06.644
I can't believe
you'd pull a stunt like that.

14:06.646 --> 14:09.314
- Does it hurt very much?
- Only when I burp.

14:09.316 --> 14:12.684
[burps]
Ow!

14:12.686 --> 14:14.752
Why did you ever leave
the attic?

14:14.754 --> 14:19.324
Because you lied, you...
you liar.

14:19.326 --> 14:23.294
[burps]
Ow! Oh, it hurts so bad.

14:23.296 --> 14:26.431
- I never lied to you.
- Yes, you did.

14:26.433 --> 14:29.601
You said I could have leftovers.
There won't be any.

14:29.603 --> 14:32.637
You said I could watch the
party. You moved it inside.

14:32.639 --> 14:35.139
Well, how was I supposed to know
it was gonna rain?

14:35.141 --> 14:38.142
A good host would know.

14:38.144 --> 14:41.379
Listen, we made a deal.
I expect you to live up to it.

14:41.381 --> 14:44.015
Now, you stay here,
right here in the shed

14:44.017 --> 14:46.451
and don't move
or you get nothing.

14:46.453 --> 14:48.486
That's non-negotiable.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.288
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

14:52.993 --> 14:55.360
He never learns.

14:55.362 --> 14:57.495
[burps]
Ow! Ow! Ow!

14:59.032 --> 15:01.699
Do you think there's really
such thing as zombies?

15:01.701 --> 15:04.502
You're at this party
and you have to ask?

15:04.504 --> 15:06.838
Could I watch you work sometime?

15:06.840 --> 15:11.442
Sure. Come by Labor Day weekend.
That's like our Christmas.

15:11.444 --> 15:12.877
Great.

15:14.381 --> 15:15.813
Hon?

15:18.218 --> 15:20.151
How's it going in here?

15:20.153 --> 15:22.687
I'm thinking about going to the
movies with the other guests.

15:24.724 --> 15:26.791
They're easier to catch
when they're lit.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.065
[sniffing]

15:36.636 --> 15:40.471
See the pig, take the pig.

15:43.243 --> 15:45.043
Listen, I know
it's not part of my fee

15:45.045 --> 15:47.412
but I have a couple ideas
that might liven things

15:47.414 --> 15:48.680
up a little bit.

15:48.682 --> 15:50.348
Well, good. What are they?

15:50.350 --> 15:54.018
One is an imitation
of Bette Davis in Baby Jane.

15:54.020 --> 15:57.622
[as Davis]
"Blanche, you didn't eat
your lunch."

15:59.459 --> 16:01.659
We'll take the other one.

16:01.661 --> 16:04.295
[sighs]

16:04.297 --> 16:06.965
Very well. Alright.

16:06.967 --> 16:09.033
Everybody, conga.

16:09.035 --> 16:11.803
- Somebody grab my butt.
- Ooh.

16:11.805 --> 16:13.538
[conga music on radio]

16:21.047 --> 16:23.047
Hey, how's it going, George?

16:25.051 --> 16:26.718
I don't know if it's
what you put in the punch

16:26.720 --> 16:30.788
but I swear I saw your dog
making himself a sandwich.

16:33.093 --> 16:37.762
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
He can't even catch a Frisbee.

16:37.764 --> 16:39.764
It must be the excitement.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.466
Why don't you join
the conga line?

16:41.468 --> 16:45.436
What the heck? The movie doesn't
start for about half an hour.

16:45.438 --> 16:47.805
[whistling]

16:52.479 --> 16:54.979
[music continues]

17:09.963 --> 17:13.431
Ugh! Oh, Willie,
it's not my fault.

17:13.433 --> 17:16.901
It was that devil music.
It called to me.

17:16.903 --> 17:19.003
Suddenly I was burning
with passion

17:19.005 --> 17:22.073
desperately longing
for a Carmen Miranda hat

17:22.075 --> 17:24.809
the kind with fruit.

17:24.811 --> 17:27.345
- Uh-huh.
- Ugh.

17:27.347 --> 17:31.349
You can't be trusted, pal.
This is for your own good.

17:31.351 --> 17:34.652
Ha! There isn't a garden shed
in this town that could hold me.

17:36.523 --> 17:37.855
[humming conga music]

17:37.857 --> 17:42.026
[burps]
Ow! Oh. Ooh. Ugh.

17:44.531 --> 17:48.366
Oh, I see you decided to escape
too, huh? I don't blame you.

17:48.368 --> 17:52.103
I think I've heard all the tales
from the crypt I can stand.

17:52.105 --> 17:54.405
Where's Julius now?

17:54.407 --> 17:57.008
He's hanging out
with the older guests.

17:58.978 --> 18:01.245
- I guess I better go back in.
- Okay.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.648
By the way,
ALF is tied up in the shed.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.149
Okay.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.020
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:09.022 --> 18:11.789
Turned out to be a pretty nice
evening after all, didn't it?

18:11.791 --> 18:13.691
Extremely nice.

18:13.693 --> 18:16.327
I never got a chance to
introduce myself. I'm Robert.

18:16.329 --> 18:19.030
Robert, hi. I'm Lynn.

18:19.032 --> 18:21.933
Your, uh, boyfriend seems nice.

18:21.935 --> 18:24.335
- Oh, he's not my boyfriend.
- Praise Allah.

18:24.337 --> 18:26.237
I knew it didn't add up.

18:28.508 --> 18:32.577
[grunts]
If David Copperfield could do
this, how hard could it be?

18:34.347 --> 18:37.081
I've been desperately hoping
his beeper would go off.

18:37.083 --> 18:40.184
I'm kind of in between
boyfriends right now.

18:40.186 --> 18:42.653
Oh, yeah. Like I'm between jobs.

18:44.023 --> 18:45.890
Probably look
pretty ridiculous, right?

18:45.892 --> 18:47.992
No.

18:47.994 --> 18:50.928
I've always been a sucker
for a man in uniform.

18:50.930 --> 18:52.230
[ALF burps]
'Ow!'

18:52.232 --> 18:55.533
Ahem. Excuse me.

18:55.535 --> 18:57.368
So how long have you been
catering?

18:57.370 --> 18:59.070
Oh, I just help out Rex.

18:59.072 --> 19:00.872
Actually, I spend
most of my time

19:00.874 --> 19:03.007
as a street performer
at the beach.

19:03.009 --> 19:05.076
Do you do anything
besides twirl?

19:05.078 --> 19:07.278
Um, I read minds.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.580
And you thought Julius
was my boyfriend?

19:09.582 --> 19:12.083
[scoffs]
You must not be very good.

19:12.085 --> 19:14.619
I knew you were gonna say that.
Really, I did.

19:17.891 --> 19:19.891
- Goodbye.
- Goodnight, George.

19:19.893 --> 19:21.359
- Goodnight.
- Oh, George.

19:21.361 --> 19:23.027
Thank you so much for coming.

19:23.029 --> 19:26.030
Your husband thinks I'm crazy,
but I know what I saw.

19:26.032 --> 19:29.000
Your dog knows
how to make a sandwich.

19:29.002 --> 19:31.969
You should try to get him
on "Letterman."

19:31.971 --> 19:34.772
We would,
but Paul Shaffer scares him.

19:39.212 --> 19:41.412
Didn't you want
to say goodbye to Lynn?

19:41.414 --> 19:44.315
No, she's too desperate.

19:44.317 --> 19:45.983
I want a girl that wants me
for me

19:45.985 --> 19:48.786
not because I have
a glamorous job.

19:48.788 --> 19:52.089
- Well, if you can find one.
- Goodnight.

19:52.091 --> 19:53.324
You got my card, right?

19:53.326 --> 19:54.759
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

19:54.761 --> 19:57.495
- Thanks for coming.
- Nice party. Uh.

19:57.497 --> 20:00.331
Sorry about the carpet.
Julius never had poi before.

20:02.468 --> 20:04.902
Don't worry about it.
See you Monday.

20:08.274 --> 20:11.342
Do you think people had fun?
Oh, who cares?

20:11.344 --> 20:13.244
We bought ourselves
four more years.

20:15.315 --> 20:19.116
Well, we're all done cleaning
up. Thanks again for using us.

20:19.118 --> 20:22.153
Oh, and if that no-good pastry
chef of mine calls again

20:22.155 --> 20:25.590
you can tell him to drop dead.
Come on, Robert.

20:25.592 --> 20:26.857
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

20:26.859 --> 20:28.793
- I'll call.
- I'll answer.

20:28.795 --> 20:30.261
I'll puke.

20:31.564 --> 20:34.031
How did you get out of the shed?

20:34.033 --> 20:36.367
I think the important thing
to remember

20:36.369 --> 20:38.936
is how much fun
you had building it.

20:38.938 --> 20:43.541
And to hold on tight
to your pacifist beliefs.

20:44.777 --> 20:46.644
What's happened to my shed?

20:46.646 --> 20:52.550
Oh, we're past that.
Now, take me to my pig.

20:52.552 --> 20:54.685
There is no pig.

20:54.687 --> 20:56.721
What?

20:56.723 --> 20:59.690
You heard me. There are no
leftovers. The pig is gone.

20:59.692 --> 21:02.326
[mimics Porky Pig stuttering]
That's all, folks.

21:04.097 --> 21:08.032
Oh, great. Fine. Terrific.

21:08.034 --> 21:09.834
I wouldn't have had this problem

21:09.836 --> 21:12.270
if more of your friends
kept kosher.

21:13.640 --> 21:14.939
Huh.

21:17.677 --> 21:18.676
[instrumental music]

21:22.148 --> 21:23.881
Oh, hey,
we got a thank-you note.

21:23.883 --> 21:26.117
- Oh.
- It's from Pat and Cecile.

21:26.119 --> 21:28.019
They said they had
a very nice time.

21:28.021 --> 21:31.889
Oh, well, how thoughtful.
Who are Pat and Cecile?

21:33.259 --> 21:35.459
I don't know.
I thought you knew.

21:35.461 --> 21:39.297
Well, that was certainly
worth $1200.

21:41.267 --> 21:44.368
Robert has the sweetest way
of asking a girl out.

21:44.370 --> 21:46.037
Really? What did he say?

21:46.039 --> 21:48.739
He said, "It was a slow day
on the pier.

21:48.741 --> 21:50.941
You want to treat me
to a movie?"

21:50.943 --> 21:52.276
If you play your cards right

21:52.278 --> 21:55.112
maybe next time
you can buy him dinner.

21:55.114 --> 21:58.616
ALF, there's more to
relationships than money.

21:58.618 --> 22:01.218
Yeah, but should you be talking
about that stuff

22:01.220 --> 22:02.853
in front of your parents?

22:04.223 --> 22:06.657
Ha. I think not.
