01:04.958 --> 01:06.250
Hello?

01:06.250 --> 01:07.583
<i>Callum.</i>

01:09.291 --> 01:13.000
<i>I want you
to meet me in 15 minutes.</i>

01:13.958 --> 01:16.750
What? Tonight? Now?

01:17.333 --> 01:20.166
<i>- At this location.</i>

01:21.375 --> 01:23.583
Uh, no, I... I don't think
I can make that in time.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.458
<i>Fine.</i>

01:25.458 --> 01:29.375
<i>I mean, I'm happy to text your girlfriend
the screenshots if you like</i>,

01:29.375 --> 01:31.375
<i>or, uh, or your mum.</i>

01:31.375 --> 01:32.541
No, don't.

01:32.541 --> 01:34.833
Please don't tell my mum.

01:34.833 --> 01:37.041
<i>Well, then, be here in 15 minutes,</i>

01:37.041 --> 01:41.250
<i>or everyone in your contact list
will get the screenshots.</i>

02:03.375 --> 02:04.500
Shit.

02:05.500 --> 02:06.666
Not now. No.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.791
<i>- Emergency. What service do you require?</i>
- Yeah, uh, hello?

02:14.791 --> 02:18.291
<i>- Fire, police or ambulance?</i>
- Uh, ambulance, please. Um...

02:19.208 --> 02:22.125
Uh, maybe police. There's been a crash.

02:22.125 --> 02:23.208
Uh...

02:23.208 --> 02:24.916
No, there's someone in the road.

02:25.833 --> 02:28.541
A man.
Uh, maybe someone in the car.

02:29.375 --> 02:30.958
I think they're, um...

02:33.166 --> 02:34.208
Okay.

02:35.250 --> 02:36.291
Yeah.

02:37.208 --> 02:38.916
Yeah. I... I can check.

02:39.833 --> 02:42.041
Uh, the man in the road is, um...

02:44.875 --> 02:47.416
No. No, I don't think he is.

02:49.833 --> 02:52.458
Okay. Just stay on the line.

02:53.333 --> 02:55.041
Just don't leave me alone.

03:01.791 --> 03:04.000
-  Shit.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.625
No, the passenger... looks really bad.

03:09.500 --> 03:10.791
No, it looks like they've...

03:13.875 --> 03:15.083
Shit.

03:34.416 --> 03:35.958
-  Morning.
- There you go.

03:35.958 --> 03:39.916
Cerys Jones, city banker, high achiever,

03:39.916 --> 03:41.833
disappeared seven years ago.

03:41.833 --> 03:43.416
Suspected suicide.

03:44.166 --> 03:45.750
So where's she been?

03:45.750 --> 03:49.000
Well, from
what we can tell, on ice.

03:51.333 --> 03:52.750
What, for seven years?

03:52.750 --> 03:56.208
Well, we won't know for how long
until we can run proper tests.

03:57.041 --> 03:57.875
And the car?

03:58.791 --> 04:02.458
Reported stolen.
South London, ten days ago.

04:02.458 --> 04:05.083
What about the lad that called it in?
What's his name? Um...

04:06.458 --> 04:07.291
Aldrich?

04:07.791 --> 04:08.666
Callum.

04:10.125 --> 04:11.250
What was he doing here?

04:11.750 --> 04:14.000
Yeah, well, that's the question.

04:14.583 --> 04:16.500
He left work to drive here

04:16.500 --> 04:19.000
for no reason
that we've been able to establish.

04:19.833 --> 04:21.750
Saw the site, called 999,

04:21.750 --> 04:23.541
and then evaporated.

04:33.791 --> 04:37.458
This isn't a case of wrong place
at the wrong time, is it?

04:38.625 --> 04:39.750
Someone wanted him here.

04:39.750 --> 04:41.500
Sorry. We can't let you through.

04:41.500 --> 04:43.875
I have to. I've been waiting too long.

04:44.541 --> 04:45.750
Who's that?

04:45.750 --> 04:48.666
It's the mother. Corinne.

04:51.208 --> 04:55.000
Corinne, hi. I'm DCI Luther.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.625
I'm in charge of finding your son.

04:56.625 --> 04:57.666
Where is he?

04:57.666 --> 04:59.750
Well, we don't know. Not yet.

04:59.750 --> 05:01.250
This scene is...

05:01.250 --> 05:02.541
It's... it's unusual.

05:02.541 --> 05:06.875
My son is out there somewhere right now.
So you need to find him.

05:06.875 --> 05:09.833
-  I'll do the very best I can.
-  It's not good enough.

05:09.833 --> 05:11.708
I need you to promise me.

05:12.291 --> 05:14.625
I need you to promise me
you'll find Callum.

05:19.708 --> 05:20.708
Okay.

05:21.708 --> 05:22.791
I promise.

05:23.375 --> 05:25.750
I'll bring your boy home. Okay?

05:26.583 --> 05:28.458
Now, try not to worry too much.

05:48.333 --> 05:49.583
No, no, no relax.

05:49.583 --> 05:52.541
This isn't about you
and your predilections.

05:52.541 --> 05:56.083
There's this chap,
Detective Chief Inspector Luther.

05:56.875 --> 06:00.291
And he's in charge of finding
this poor young lad Callum,

06:00.791 --> 06:03.083
and I can't allow that to happen,
I'm afraid.

06:04.916 --> 06:06.250
Now, listen, listen.

06:07.208 --> 06:09.916
From what I hear,
DCI Luther's a bit of a bad apple.

06:10.416 --> 06:13.541
Trouble is, he's a very analog bad apple.

06:13.541 --> 06:16.000
Doesn't have what you might call
an online presence,

06:16.000 --> 06:18.750
which is why I'm calling you.

06:20.166 --> 06:23.666
I want everything on him.

06:24.458 --> 06:27.000
Every furtive little secret,

06:27.750 --> 06:29.833
every intimate disgrace.

06:31.208 --> 06:34.041
<i>I want his corruption.</i>

06:35.166 --> 06:37.666
<i>I want evidence of any misstep.</i>

06:37.666 --> 06:39.583
<i>Any wrongdoing.</i>

06:41.083 --> 06:43.000
<i>Any line he's crossed.</i>

06:44.583 --> 06:48.208
I want... his shame.

07:04.083 --> 07:07.250
Extraordinary scenes today
outside London's Old Bailey,

07:07.250 --> 07:11.333
where following the release to the media
of an apparently incriminating dossier,

07:11.333 --> 07:12.708
DCI John Luther,

07:12.708 --> 07:15.375
<i>a storied police officer,
is appearing in a multitude</i>

07:15.375 --> 07:17.166
<i>of serious criminal charges.</i>

07:17.166 --> 07:20.416
<i>And yet he now stands charged
with a shocking catalog of crimes</i>

07:20.416 --> 07:24.208
<i>including breaking and entering,
suspect intimidation,</i>

07:24.208 --> 07:26.125
<i>tampering with evidence, bribery.</i>

07:26.125 --> 07:31.208
<i>A litany of alleged vigilante activity
that critics say attest to a man</i>

07:31.208 --> 07:34.916
<i>who felt entitled
to take justice into his own hands</i>...

07:34.916 --> 07:38.750
<i>Detective Chief Inspector John Luther
was in charge of the hunt</i>

07:38.750 --> 07:41.083
<i>for missing London teenager Callum Aldrich</i>

07:41.083 --> 07:42.708
<i>at the time of his arrest.</i>

07:42.708 --> 07:45.958
<i>Since when,
London police have been heavily criticized</i>

07:45.958 --> 07:48.750
<i>for the lack of progress in this case.</i>

07:48.750 --> 07:52.750
<i>DCI Luther had recently apprehended
husband and wife serial killers</i>

07:52.750 --> 07:54.583
<i>Jeremy and Vivian Lake</i>,

07:54.583 --> 07:57.916
<i>whilst leading the hunt
for the missing teenager Callum Aldrich.</i>

07:57.916 --> 08:01.291
<i>...for the metropolitan police commented
that the search for Callum Aldrich</i>

08:01.291 --> 08:03.458
<i>remains their highest priority.</i>

08:03.458 --> 08:04.958
Good luck with that, now, mate.

08:04.958 --> 08:07.541
<i>...we expect
to see Luther being driven out</i>

08:07.541 --> 08:09.416
<i>through the gates of the Old Bailey</i>

08:09.416 --> 08:13.583
<i>to begin a lengthy sentence
at Hawksmoor maximum security prison.</i>

08:13.583 --> 08:16.083
-  Here he comes! Here he comes!

08:20.458 --> 08:22.541
-  Hey, Luther! Luther!

08:26.625 --> 08:29.583
<i>As a former police officer,
what life will be like for him there</i>

08:29.583 --> 08:31.333
<i>is anybody's guess.</i>

08:34.500 --> 08:40.750
Okay, then.
I think we are about ready to go.

09:11.416 --> 09:13.875
 Stand up if you hate police!

09:13.875 --> 09:16.541
Stand up if you hate police!

09:16.541 --> 09:19.000
- Stand up if you hate police!

09:19.000 --> 09:21.875
 Stand up if you hate police!

09:21.875 --> 09:22.875
Hurry up.

09:22.875 --> 09:24.458
 ...if you hate police!

09:24.458 --> 09:29.833
 Stand up if you hate police!
Stand up if you hate police!

09:29.833 --> 09:32.166
- Stand up if you hate police!

09:32.166 --> 09:33.458
Come on, let's go.

09:34.291 --> 09:37.041
Out of the way. Come on. Move! Move!

09:38.333 --> 09:39.458
Come on.

09:39.458 --> 09:42.000
-  Fuck you, copper.
- Move. Get out of the way!

09:43.166 --> 09:44.458
Back up!

09:44.458 --> 09:47.125
-  Come on.

09:54.791 --> 09:57.125
-  Watch your back, copper.
- Fuck off.

09:58.666 --> 10:01.875
-  Come on. Let's get moving.

10:30.916 --> 10:32.166
Hello.

10:32.166 --> 10:33.166
<i>Mum?</i>

10:34.458 --> 10:35.500
Who is this?

10:36.000 --> 10:38.166
<i>- Mum, can you come and get me?</i>
- Who is this?

10:39.000 --> 10:39.833
<i>Mum, it's me.</i>

10:39.833 --> 10:42.791
Callum? Is it really you? Callum?

11:38.458 --> 11:39.416
Callum?

11:44.750 --> 11:47.125
<i>Hey, it's Callum.
Sorry I missed your call.</i>

11:47.125 --> 11:49.166
<i>Uh, leave me a message
at the sound of the beep.</i>

11:53.458 --> 11:54.541
Hello?

12:04.875 --> 12:05.875
Callum?

12:07.375 --> 12:09.083
Callum, it's me. It's Mum.

12:14.041 --> 12:16.625
<i>Hey, it's Callum.
Sorry I missed your call.</i>

12:20.166 --> 12:21.333
Callum.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.291
<i>Hey, it's Callum...</i>

14:11.958 --> 14:15.416
DCI Raine. Yep. Okay.

14:20.208 --> 14:22.833
Back up, please. Back up.

14:22.833 --> 14:25.708
<i>Our reporter,
John Cunningham, is at the scene.</i>

14:25.708 --> 14:28.291
<i>Details are sketchy at this stage.</i>

14:28.291 --> 14:31.916
<i>The scene is tightly cordoned off,
but there are unconfirmed reports</i>

14:31.916 --> 14:34.541
<i>that a number of bodies
have been found in the house.</i>

14:35.583 --> 14:37.708
<i>We're awaiting confirmation
that one of the bodies</i>

14:37.708 --> 14:40.791
<i>is that of the missing teenager
Callum Aldrich.</i>

14:40.791 --> 14:43.208
<i>The police are yet to issue
any official information.</i>

15:02.000 --> 15:03.041
<i>Eight victims.</i>

15:03.041 --> 15:05.541
Each officially a missing person
until last night.

15:05.541 --> 15:07.375
The house belongs to a Saudi national

15:07.375 --> 15:10.083
who hasn't set foot on British soil
in five years.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.416
Our killer must've known that.
Let's find out how.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Earliest crime goes back 11 years.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.458
The most recent dates back to last year.

15:17.458 --> 15:20.416
So, where were
the bodies stored in the interim?

15:20.416 --> 15:24.000
And who would have
the kind of space, time, or money

15:24.000 --> 15:25.500
to do something like that?

15:25.500 --> 15:28.791
This has been carefully planned
and executed over a number of years,

15:28.791 --> 15:30.500
so there'll be a lot of data to parse.

15:30.500 --> 15:31.583
But...

15:32.291 --> 15:37.375
you find me one point of commonality
between these victims, just one,

15:38.916 --> 15:41.125
- and you'll have our killer.
-  Yes, ma'am.

15:41.250 --> 15:42.208
Let's get to it.

15:43.541 --> 15:44.750
Find me that connection.

16:19.083 --> 16:20.125
Shit.

16:31.416 --> 16:34.541
<i>No, no, no!</i>

16:36.250 --> 16:37.208
<i>Mum!</i>

16:38.958 --> 16:41.416
<i>Mum! Ah! Ah! Please stop!</i>

16:44.791 --> 16:47.541
<i>Hello again, John.</i>

16:49.500 --> 16:52.500
<i>Do you know who that was?
Oh, I'll bet you do.</i>

16:52.500 --> 16:54.125
<i>Oh, poor Callum.</i>

16:55.791 --> 16:58.333
<i>You know, I had him.</i>

16:58.333 --> 17:00.666
<i>Yeah, I had him tucked away,</i>

17:01.333 --> 17:05.333
<i>and I stood next to you at a bus stop.</i>

17:06.208 --> 17:09.541
<i>Offered you a mint, and you took it.</i>

17:10.791 --> 17:15.708
<i>I looked you right in the eye
'cause I was curious.</i>

17:16.458 --> 17:21.041
<i>I wanted to know if you'd see it in me.</i>

17:21.750 --> 17:25.583
<i>Because that is who you are, isn't it?</i>

17:25.583 --> 17:30.625
<i>The man who knows
all about people like me.</i>

17:31.875 --> 17:34.125
<i>But you didn't see me.</i>

17:35.791 --> 17:40.750
<i>And now you are in a cage
because I put you there.</i>

17:42.500 --> 17:47.333
<i>It makes me wonder how you're gonna feel,
having to watch what happens next.</i>

17:51.416 --> 17:52.333
You all right?

17:53.500 --> 17:54.791
Tickety-boo.

17:55.750 --> 17:57.375
Someone's here to see you.

18:00.583 --> 18:01.666
Who?

18:01.666 --> 18:03.625
Barbra Streisand. Fuck do I know?

18:17.291 --> 18:18.375
Corinne?

18:19.958 --> 18:22.041
Well, you remembered my name at least.

18:24.166 --> 18:26.125
Of course I remember your name.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.791
Corinne, what are you doing here?

18:37.208 --> 18:38.541
Corinne, I'm so...

18:38.541 --> 18:41.125
Do you know what they did to him?

18:44.375 --> 18:45.291
No.

18:47.166 --> 18:48.416
Can you talk me through it?

18:49.458 --> 18:50.333
Hmm?

18:50.833 --> 18:51.916
Why?

18:54.625 --> 18:56.125
So you can help?

18:57.750 --> 19:00.000
Well, you already promised me that once.

19:01.500 --> 19:03.833
You looked me in the eye and promised me.

19:06.375 --> 19:08.916
But it seems you were busy
with more important things.

19:14.500 --> 19:17.250
I hope someone tells you
what they did to my son.

19:20.416 --> 19:21.916
I hope you never sleep again.

19:28.375 --> 19:32.500
Corinne. Corinne, wait.
Wait, wait. Corinne.

19:34.333 --> 19:35.500
Liar.

19:58.750 --> 20:00.625
Thank you so much for doing this.

20:01.541 --> 20:03.666
I never could have driven myself.

20:03.666 --> 20:06.083
Honestly, no worries. I...

20:07.083 --> 20:09.333
Anything that you need.

20:10.416 --> 20:11.708
Anything. You just...

20:11.708 --> 20:13.208
You just have to ask.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.958
<i>Police are yet to reveal
any official information,</i>

20:34.958 --> 20:38.291
<i>although we have been informed
that there are multiple fatalities,</i>

20:38.291 --> 20:41.416
<i>which occurred in a fire
shortly before midnight.</i>

20:41.416 --> 20:44.000
<i>We are awaiting further information
from the authorities</i>

20:44.000 --> 20:45.708
<i>surrounding the circumstances.</i>

20:45.708 --> 20:48.083
So, no neighbors.
Plenty of space...

20:48.083 --> 20:50.458
Excuse me, ma'am. There's a call for you.

20:50.458 --> 20:51.833
He says it's urgent.

20:51.833 --> 20:52.791
Thank you.

20:54.333 --> 20:55.166
DCI Raine.

20:55.166 --> 20:59.041
DCI Raine, it's, uh, DCI John Luther...

20:59.041 --> 21:01.125
<i>Well, I mean</i>, <i>it's not...</i>

21:01.125 --> 21:03.250
I, um, was a DCI in your department.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.375
Of course. I've heard of you.

21:08.208 --> 21:10.875
-<i>How did you get this call out to me?</i>
- Callum Aldrich.

21:11.583 --> 21:12.833
That was my case.

21:12.833 --> 21:14.625
I'm aware of that. Yes.

21:14.625 --> 21:17.541
<i>The killer contacted me and sent me</i>

21:17.541 --> 21:19.416
<i>a recording of Callum's death.</i>

21:19.416 --> 21:22.416
Now, he also sent me a personal message.

21:22.416 --> 21:24.041
Okay, I'm... I'm sorry.

21:24.041 --> 21:26.250
I can't imagine how that must feel,
but truthfully,

21:26.250 --> 21:28.541
<i>he has contacted everyone.</i>

21:29.041 --> 21:29.875
He did what?

21:29.875 --> 21:32.375
He sent recordings of the murders

21:32.375 --> 21:34.416
<i>to all eight families.</i>

21:34.416 --> 21:36.750
So why... why does he make an announcement?

21:37.250 --> 21:39.583
Why does he make
an announcement right now?

21:41.333 --> 21:43.500
I'll tell you why.
Because something's coming.

21:44.250 --> 21:46.833
<i>And whatever it is,
he needs... he needs an audience.</i>

21:46.833 --> 21:49.375
<i>That's the kind of personality he is.
He needs an audience.</i>

21:49.375 --> 21:51.791
- Read the room, John. Stop.
<i>- He wants us to see it.</i>

21:51.791 --> 21:53.291
Get ahead of him, get ahead of him

21:53.291 --> 21:55.500
and stop worrying about
where he's come from,

21:55.500 --> 21:56.875
<i>but where he's about to go next.</i>

21:56.875 --> 21:59.125
- I said enough! Enough.
-  Jesus.

21:59.125 --> 22:00.166
<i>Do you think I give a shit</i>

22:00.166 --> 22:02.500
about a dirty copper's
unfinished business?

22:04.416 --> 22:06.125
<i>Do you think I need advice from you?</i>

22:07.250 --> 22:09.250
You can't help me, John,

22:09.250 --> 22:11.291
<i>and God knows
you can't help Callum Aldrich.</i>

22:11.291 --> 22:13.250
It is still my case.

22:13.250 --> 22:15.083
No, it's not. It's mine.

22:15.083 --> 22:17.791
You abdicated yourself of that privilege
when you did what you did.

22:17.791 --> 22:20.000
<i>And... and you know, honestly, I'm glad.</i>

22:20.000 --> 22:22.083
<i>I am glad that you're ashamed.</i>

22:22.958 --> 22:25.375
<i>I'm glad that it hurts
to be where you are because...</i>

22:25.375 --> 22:27.083
<i>because it should.</i>

22:27.666 --> 22:29.875
Now, do not call this office again.

22:29.875 --> 22:32.791
If you do one call and
I will have you slammed up in solitary

22:32.791 --> 22:34.333
for the duration. Clear?

22:38.291 --> 22:41.458
Well done, Raine. I'm still a copper.

22:41.458 --> 22:44.208
<i>Ah no. No, you're not.</i>

22:45.791 --> 22:46.833
Not anymore.

22:53.291 --> 22:56.541
Put a call in to the prison governor.
Get that phone taken off him. Thank you.

23:02.625 --> 23:05.333
To be honest,
I don't know why you bothered calling.

23:06.125 --> 23:08.250
It's not even my area of expertise.

23:08.250 --> 23:09.666
<i>I'm basically a thief.</i>

23:09.666 --> 23:11.625
I'm not asking you to fucking marry me.

23:12.208 --> 23:13.625
<i>I'm asking you to do me a job.</i>

23:13.625 --> 23:16.416
It's not the job I've a problem with.
It's who I'd be doing it for.

23:16.416 --> 23:17.875
Oh, for fuck's sake.

23:20.875 --> 23:24.500
Look, I didn't trust you
when you were the right side of the law.

23:24.500 --> 23:25.583
Why would I now?

23:27.166 --> 23:28.750
Dennis, you been watching the news?

23:28.750 --> 23:30.875
<i>The Bishops Avenue thing.
Have you seen that?</i>

23:30.875 --> 23:32.750
<i>Have you seen what that prick has done?</i>

23:33.750 --> 23:34.750
Yeah, yeah, I saw that.

23:34.750 --> 23:38.625
So, you can... you can see
why I've got to get the fuck out of here.

23:39.916 --> 23:40.916
You're having a laugh.

23:46.875 --> 23:49.250
I know what happened to you
and to your mum.

23:49.250 --> 23:52.958
And I know that you were eight years old.

23:52.958 --> 23:55.458
That's why I'm calling you,
you of all people,

23:55.458 --> 23:57.333
because you hate pricks like this.

23:58.041 --> 23:59.000
And so do I.

24:01.083 --> 24:02.583
Yeah!

24:06.875 --> 24:08.416
So what are you asking?

24:17.041 --> 24:18.041
Stand still!

24:30.875 --> 24:32.583
Me being in here...

24:33.083 --> 24:36.333
I know it makes your life very difficult.

24:37.250 --> 24:39.083
Make me someone else's problem.

24:40.833 --> 24:43.125
Get me transferred out tonight.

24:43.125 --> 24:46.125
We can't make that happen by magic.
There are systems in place.

24:46.125 --> 24:47.541
I know what systems are in place,

24:47.541 --> 24:49.666
which is why you've gotta
let 'em have what they want.

24:49.666 --> 24:51.125
Let them come at me,

24:51.125 --> 24:54.625
so big, so loud<i>,</i>
that the system has to kick in,

24:55.416 --> 24:56.958
has to transfer me.

24:56.958 --> 24:58.500
- Let them at you?
- Yeah.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.583
How does that make sense?

25:00.583 --> 25:01.875
Because I'm ready.

25:03.166 --> 25:04.250
Can you do it or not?

25:07.291 --> 25:10.000
I mean, in theory, yeah, but...

25:11.000 --> 25:15.458
If it goes wrong, spins out of control,
you're a dead man. They'll kill you, John.

25:15.458 --> 25:18.208
All right, yeah. I... I can live with that.

25:20.625 --> 25:21.750
So let 'em come.

25:24.708 --> 25:26.500
Let them come.

25:28.416 --> 25:30.000
Get off! Get on the ground!

25:50.458 --> 25:51.541
Shit.

25:52.416 --> 25:53.708
Look. Shit.

26:09.916 --> 26:11.541
Now! All available staff!

26:19.750 --> 26:21.166
Ah!

26:42.875 --> 26:44.291
Get down!

26:50.583 --> 26:52.125
Grab that for him!

27:51.291 --> 27:52.208
Ah!

28:29.416 --> 28:30.375
Gah!

28:32.625 --> 28:33.541
Off!

29:04.166 --> 29:05.666
Stop! Stop! Stop!

30:22.125 --> 30:25.208
Don't fucking move!
Don't fucking move!

30:25.208 --> 30:26.666
Get on the fucking ground.

30:40.083 --> 30:41.916
-  Open the fucking door!

30:41.916 --> 30:44.708
- Come here! Move it! Open the door now!

30:45.208 --> 30:46.708
- There!

30:48.333 --> 30:49.708
Keep your hands still!

30:50.333 --> 30:52.375
Come on! On your feet! Move it!

30:52.375 --> 30:54.791
Move it! Move it!

30:55.541 --> 30:56.458
Move!

31:12.666 --> 31:14.041
- Boo.

32:10.250 --> 32:11.833
Mmm...

32:14.708 --> 32:15.791
I can't stay long.

32:18.958 --> 32:21.500
I just wanted to pop by

32:23.166 --> 32:24.750
and show you something.

32:35.125 --> 32:37.208
<i>Something was troubling her.</i>

32:37.208 --> 32:38.500
<i>She wouldn't tell us what.</i>

32:40.333 --> 32:41.791
<i>But she was scared of someone.</i>

32:43.875 --> 32:47.000
Who is she afraid of, do you think?

32:47.625 --> 32:49.458
Poor little Brigida.

32:49.458 --> 32:52.000
<i>...the worrying spike
in unexplained disappearances</i>

32:52.000 --> 32:52.916
<i>of young adults...</i>

32:52.916 --> 32:55.416
Oh, darling, no. No. Please open...

32:55.416 --> 32:56.791
- Open your eyes.
- Mm.

32:56.791 --> 33:00.416
<i>...surrounding Brigida's
disappearance have similarities</i>

33:00.416 --> 33:03.666
<i>to those of missing French student
Camille Fontaine</i>

33:03.666 --> 33:05.750
<i>and Croatian teenager, Jacov...</i>

33:07.083 --> 33:09.125
<i>Portuguese police are unwilling to...</i>

33:09.750 --> 33:10.666
You know...

33:17.375 --> 33:18.916
You always said...

33:20.791 --> 33:22.833
that I should talk to somebody about this.

33:22.833 --> 33:23.791
Mmm...

33:24.958 --> 33:28.500
And so that's exactly what I'm doing...

33:31.958 --> 33:33.125
because...

33:36.666 --> 33:38.333
<i>♪ I'm coming out ♪</i>

33:39.166 --> 33:43.791
<i>♪ I want the world to know

<i>♪ I'm coming out ♪</i>

33:47.208 --> 33:51.583
<i>♪ I want the world to know

33:51.583 --> 33:52.541
<i>♪ I'm... ♪</i>

34:30.291 --> 34:31.916
Christ on a scooter.

34:34.625 --> 34:37.458
These the wheels you bought
from Fat Thommo Chitwood that time?

34:37.458 --> 34:40.541
Yeah. Five hundred quid
and a bootleg David Bowie album.

34:41.291 --> 34:42.250
Blue vinyl.

34:42.875 --> 34:44.166
Never let me down though.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.166
Never will.

34:46.166 --> 34:47.916
If you look after it,

34:49.041 --> 34:50.375
which you haven't.

34:50.875 --> 34:52.125
Yeah, well.

34:54.958 --> 34:55.958
Cheers, Den.

34:59.291 --> 35:01.166
I got you that thing you asked for.

35:06.125 --> 35:07.000
Perfect.

35:08.125 --> 35:09.166
Listen, Luther.

35:11.291 --> 35:13.791
When you take this prick to the ground,

35:15.333 --> 35:18.291
you do him grievous on my behalf, yeah?

35:19.416 --> 35:20.416
You do him damage.

35:28.666 --> 35:30.000
You take care, John.

35:32.125 --> 35:32.958
Yeah.

35:52.166 --> 35:53.291
DCI Raine.

35:58.458 --> 35:59.500
When?

36:02.416 --> 36:03.333
Okay.

36:10.916 --> 36:12.083
Okay, thank you.

36:13.208 --> 36:14.416
Boss? What's up?

36:14.416 --> 36:15.375
Luther's out.

36:15.375 --> 36:16.541
Luther's what?

36:16.541 --> 36:17.583
Out.

37:17.166 --> 37:18.625
Detective Superintendent Schenk.

37:19.791 --> 37:22.875
Just Martin. I'm retired.

37:22.875 --> 37:24.750
Well, they retired me.

37:25.708 --> 37:26.916
DCI Raine.

37:26.916 --> 37:27.958
Ah.

37:28.750 --> 37:30.041
My replacement.

37:30.916 --> 37:32.708
So how are things at the shop?

37:33.416 --> 37:35.375
Busy. Do you mind if I sit?

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
I presume you've come for background
in the Aldrich case.

37:40.500 --> 37:41.500
But for that you're...

37:41.500 --> 37:45.125
I know who I have to go to,
which is basically my problem.

37:45.875 --> 37:49.500
Look, I know he's in prison,
but if all you need is background,

37:49.500 --> 37:51.208
I don't see an ethical conundrum.

37:51.208 --> 37:52.750
Except he's not in prison.

37:52.750 --> 37:54.583
But... Oh.

37:56.958 --> 37:58.458
Of course he's not.

37:58.458 --> 38:00.958
Listen. He's your friend?

38:00.958 --> 38:03.083
- He is.
- You know him better than anyone.

38:03.083 --> 38:04.625
You know how he thinks.

38:04.625 --> 38:07.208
If John really is your friend,
you'll find him,

38:07.208 --> 38:09.083
stop him nosing at my investigation.

38:09.083 --> 38:12.500
But if John Luther shows his face
and refuses an order to stand down,

38:12.500 --> 38:14.250
which we both know he will,

38:14.250 --> 38:16.250
Tactical Unit will shoot him dead.

38:17.750 --> 38:18.750
So...

38:19.875 --> 38:20.750
Martin...

38:22.083 --> 38:24.041
I'm not asking you to catch him for me.

38:24.541 --> 38:25.583
We can do that.

38:26.875 --> 38:28.708
I'm asking you to save his life.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.333
<i>Mum!</i>

39:54.291 --> 39:56.791
<i>Mum! Ah! Ah! Please stop!</i>

39:58.500 --> 40:02.125
<i>Hello again, John.</i>

40:04.166 --> 40:05.583
<i>Do you know who that was?</i>

40:05.583 --> 40:07.166
<i>Oh, I bet you do.</i>

40:07.166 --> 40:08.500
<i>Poor Callum.</i>

40:10.166 --> 40:16.958
The killer got to him
using an FM broadcast. 65.8 FM.

40:18.083 --> 40:22.083
Trace the frequency to source
and you'll find John.

40:22.083 --> 40:24.375
Out-fucking-standing. Thank you, Martin.

40:25.375 --> 40:26.541
Bring him in.

40:27.458 --> 40:29.250
Martin, what are you doing
the rest of the day?

40:58.208 --> 40:59.166
Morning.

40:59.791 --> 41:02.333
- I'm sorry. We're not open yet.
- I'm police.

41:05.875 --> 41:07.166
Can I see your badge?

41:10.250 --> 41:11.833
I forgot it in my other coat.

41:12.916 --> 41:14.083
Sorry about that.

41:15.291 --> 41:16.541
What's your name?

41:17.041 --> 41:18.000
Derek.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.750
Derek. Do you know who I am, Derek?

41:21.541 --> 41:22.833
I don't think so, no.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.291
You really don't know who I am, do you?

41:29.416 --> 41:30.541
I really don't, no.

41:33.250 --> 41:36.583
So how come you're broadcasting
the recording of a murder to me?

41:40.208 --> 41:41.500
Wait! No!

41:42.083 --> 41:43.000
Wait!

41:54.958 --> 41:57.250
-  You fucking...

41:59.750 --> 42:00.583
Sit down!

42:01.416 --> 42:03.083
And I want you to do me a favor.

42:03.083 --> 42:05.166
Sit there and do nothing silly.
Understand?

42:05.166 --> 42:06.125
Yes.

42:10.708 --> 42:13.000
<i>Archie,
we've tracked the signal.</i>

42:13.000 --> 42:14.583
<i>Sending the coordinates now.</i>

42:20.833 --> 42:22.291
- Where is it?
- In the cup...

42:22.291 --> 42:23.625
- Where is it?
- In the cupboard.

42:23.625 --> 42:25.791
In the cupboard. Idiots.

42:31.333 --> 42:33.041
- Have you listened to this?
-  No.

42:33.041 --> 42:34.375
- Have you? No?
- No!

42:34.375 --> 42:37.125
Good, because it's fucking horrible.
You know what it is?

42:37.125 --> 42:39.208
It's the dying breaths of a young man.

42:39.208 --> 42:42.291
A young man named Callum Aldrich,
and it's fucking horrible.

42:42.291 --> 42:45.166
And I want to find the prick
that made that recording.

42:45.166 --> 42:48.458
And you're gonna help me by telling me
how this transmitter got here.

42:48.458 --> 42:49.750
- I can't.
- No?

42:50.458 --> 42:53.916
Okay, right, well, this is the part
where I do something horrible to you

42:53.916 --> 42:57.208
like perhaps, I don't know,
tattoo your fucking eyeball.

42:57.208 --> 42:59.250
How do you turn it on? Turn it on! Go on.

42:59.250 --> 43:00.458
- There you go.

43:00.458 --> 43:02.541
- No, please...
- Don't move. Stop moving!

43:02.541 --> 43:04.625
Stop moving. Stop moving!

43:05.708 --> 43:06.625
It's all right...

43:15.875 --> 43:19.166
I'm not going to do that.
I'm not going to do that. Do you know why?

43:20.125 --> 43:23.208
I've got this thing,
and I've had it since I was a kid.

43:23.208 --> 43:25.666
It's kind of like a instinct thing,
you know,

43:25.666 --> 43:29.166
where you kind of look at someone,
and you read them.

43:29.666 --> 43:31.750
And you can tell
whether they're good or bad.

43:31.750 --> 43:35.458
I can tell, I can tell, Derek,
that you're decent.

43:35.458 --> 43:36.541
Yeah.

43:36.541 --> 43:39.708
So, I'm gonna ask you again.
How did that transmitter get here?

43:40.833 --> 43:42.041
It arrived by courier.

43:44.125 --> 43:46.458
- Is that a fucking joke?
- No, no, no!

43:47.166 --> 43:50.000
I was told to leave it running
for 24 hours and then ditch it.

43:50.000 --> 43:50.916
Go on.

43:51.416 --> 43:52.666
- That's it.
- What?

43:58.041 --> 43:59.958
Don't know if you've noticed,
but your game's up!

44:00.625 --> 44:02.333
The police are here! I'm here!

44:02.333 --> 44:03.458
Now, come on.

44:03.458 --> 44:06.416
-  I met a man online.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

44:07.541 --> 44:09.750
He was into extreme submission porn.

44:09.750 --> 44:12.208
We exchanged fantasies
for a long time, months.

44:12.708 --> 44:14.666
Decided to move things
into the real world.

44:15.666 --> 44:18.083
His needs were very specific.

44:19.250 --> 44:21.791
- He wanted to be taken by surprise.
- Right.

44:22.458 --> 44:25.375
He gave me his details. Name, address,

44:25.375 --> 44:27.416
time he got home from work,
the alarm code.

44:27.416 --> 44:29.041
Speed it up. Come on. Fuck's sake.

44:29.041 --> 44:32.500
One night,
I was waiting when he came home.

44:39.708 --> 44:42.583
There was a safe word,
but he didn't use it.

44:43.958 --> 44:45.541
So, I kept going.

44:47.875 --> 44:49.416
I just kept going.

44:51.916 --> 44:55.375
Because I hadn't really
been talking to him.

44:55.375 --> 44:56.916
I'd been catfished.

44:59.125 --> 45:03.666
Set up by somebody posing as
this poor man to assault him.

45:03.666 --> 45:06.083
He had no idea who I was
or why I was there.

45:07.666 --> 45:09.291
Armed police! Get back!

45:09.291 --> 45:10.416
And then what?

45:10.916 --> 45:12.083
-  Blackmail.
- Mm-hmm.

45:13.208 --> 45:15.666
The catfisher had it all on film.
All the things I did.

45:15.666 --> 45:16.750
Who was that?

45:16.750 --> 45:18.166
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

45:18.166 --> 45:21.250
No, I don't know! Just... Look... Just...

45:22.125 --> 45:25.416
I don't know him. I've never met him.
I just do what he tells me, okay?

45:29.708 --> 45:31.416
I've got to make this right.

45:33.083 --> 45:34.916
- I really do.
- Okay.

45:34.916 --> 45:37.291
- And it's going to be bad for you.
- I know.

45:37.291 --> 45:39.125
But it's not as bad as you think.

45:40.500 --> 45:42.291
Not if you help me catch this man.

45:42.291 --> 45:43.375
I can't.

45:43.375 --> 45:44.833
Oh, you can.

45:49.875 --> 45:51.583
For fuck's sake. What is it?

45:52.291 --> 45:53.625
- Hmm?
- He texts me.

45:56.333 --> 45:58.166
- Armed police! Armed police!
- Armed police!

45:58.166 --> 46:00.583
He never uses the same phone
for more than a day.

46:01.083 --> 46:02.833
You should have given me this earlier.

46:02.833 --> 46:03.833
I know.

46:05.791 --> 46:07.375
- Armed police!
- Armed police! Go!

46:08.500 --> 46:09.875
Armed police!

46:10.416 --> 46:11.666
All clear.

46:13.666 --> 46:14.583
Let's go!

46:15.875 --> 46:16.875
All clear!

46:31.208 --> 46:33.208
Have we got the place ready?

46:34.000 --> 46:35.125
It's ready!

46:37.666 --> 46:39.333
And the last of the livestock?

46:39.333 --> 46:40.916
En route and on schedule.

46:51.375 --> 46:53.500
So we're ready to go?

46:54.958 --> 46:56.166
We're ready.

46:56.958 --> 46:59.166
<i>Here's to the start of my new life.</i>

47:00.375 --> 47:04.791
I wish you could be with me
at the launch party.

47:37.208 --> 47:38.833
<i>Where do you wanna meet?</i>

47:50.958 --> 47:52.583
<i>Oh yes.</i>

47:52.583 --> 47:55.166
<i>Yes, yes, right there</i>.

48:14.458 --> 48:16.541
<i>- Oh my God! What are you doing?
- Oh crap.</i>

48:34.541 --> 48:35.375
Schenk.

48:35.958 --> 48:36.791
Wotcha.

48:37.375 --> 48:38.916
<i>I was wondering when you'd call.</i>

48:38.916 --> 48:41.833
<i>Yeah. I see
you're back in the shop then.</i>

48:43.125 --> 48:44.416
I'm consulting, yes.

48:45.000 --> 48:46.625
<i>Helping them to catch you.</i>

48:47.125 --> 48:48.083
Ah.

48:49.333 --> 48:51.250
Great work finding me.
How did you do that?

48:52.416 --> 48:54.375
Had a sniff around your cell.

48:54.375 --> 48:56.916
<i>Found the radio tuned to a dead station.</i>

48:57.708 --> 48:59.541
<i>I know you to be a Radio 4 man.</i>

48:59.541 --> 49:03.000
Yeah, well, that or the cricket.
That was very good work.

49:03.000 --> 49:05.750
Well, there's life in the old fucker yet.

49:05.750 --> 49:09.041
<i>Oh no, I never doubted it.
Are they listening in?</i>

49:09.666 --> 49:10.625
Not yet.

49:13.666 --> 49:14.583
I got him.

49:15.208 --> 49:17.041
What do you mean you've got him?

49:17.041 --> 49:19.041
Well, as good as. I got a number.

49:19.541 --> 49:21.291
<i>- How?</i>

49:21.291 --> 49:24.958
Doesn't matter how, but the number
won't be good to you lot. Not yet.

49:24.958 --> 49:26.458
They're not my lot.

49:27.416 --> 49:28.666
Yes, and given the fact

49:28.666 --> 49:31.375
<i>that it was obtained
by an escaped criminal,</i>

49:31.375 --> 49:35.500
I doubt there'll be much of an argument
for a warrant on the back of it.

49:35.500 --> 49:36.583
<i>Can you do me a favor?</i>

49:36.583 --> 49:37.958
Can you trace the number?

49:38.500 --> 49:40.208
<i>You know I'm not going to do that.</i>

49:40.208 --> 49:42.708
Come on, boss.
What are they going to do? Fire you?

49:43.208 --> 49:45.750
<i>One more time for auld lang syne,
and for what it's worth,</i>

49:45.750 --> 49:48.250
he uses burners.
The number won't be good tomorrow.

49:55.291 --> 49:57.250
<i>Call me back in 15 minutes.</i>

49:57.791 --> 49:59.250
Hey, do you want to put 20 on it?

49:59.750 --> 50:00.750
<i>On what?</i>

50:01.250 --> 50:02.333
Twenty that I get him

50:02.333 --> 50:03.791
<i>before you get me.</i>

50:06.375 --> 50:07.583
Make it 50.

50:10.541 --> 50:14.041
Well, he's got some onions on him,
I'll give him that.

50:14.041 --> 50:16.291
Look, I know how it feels.

50:16.291 --> 50:19.416
I've sat in the same chair,
expressed the same sentiments,

50:20.125 --> 50:21.875
but there's a double play here.

50:22.583 --> 50:27.083
Do as he asks.
Trace the phone. Give him a location.

50:28.166 --> 50:30.291
Luther's pulling us
away from the case.

50:30.291 --> 50:32.375
Look, the worst outcome is

50:32.375 --> 50:34.458
he's arrested and locked up by teatime.

50:34.458 --> 50:35.791
The best outcome?

50:35.791 --> 50:39.375
He's right
and leads you directly to your killer.

50:39.375 --> 50:43.041
Except if I were Luther, I'd assume
you and I were having this conversation.

50:43.041 --> 50:45.500
He knows. Of course he knows.
He just doesn't care.

50:45.500 --> 50:48.833
All he wants
is for this man to be caught and stopped.

50:50.583 --> 50:52.000
We'd have to go in heavy.

50:53.166 --> 50:55.416
The heavier the better, I should imagine.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.333
I thought he was your friend.

50:57.333 --> 51:00.833
He is. That doesn't mean
you should trust him though.

51:03.791 --> 51:05.791
All right, boss.
What's in the box?

51:05.791 --> 51:09.125
<i>- Deal or no deal?</i>
- The phone's at Piccadilly Circus.

51:10.125 --> 51:11.041
Nice one.

51:17.083 --> 51:19.958
<i>All units,
we're searching for an IC3 male</i>

51:19.958 --> 51:21.458
<i>in the Piccadilly Circus area.</i>

51:21.458 --> 51:23.541
<i>Do not approach the subject. Over.</i>

51:29.875 --> 51:31.666
Excuse me. Uh, excuse me.

51:31.666 --> 51:34.458
I'm running late to see my wife.
Mind if I make a quick call?

51:34.458 --> 51:36.750
I lost my cell phone. I'll be two minutes.

51:36.750 --> 51:41.166
Thank you. You are a lifesaver.
Thank you so much. Right, okay, thank you.

51:46.916 --> 51:48.291
So, where is he now?

51:48.291 --> 51:50.791
<i>Stationary
for the last 20 minutes.</i>

51:50.791 --> 51:52.541
Still Piccadilly Circus.

51:52.541 --> 51:54.208
<i>Something doesn't feel right.</i>

51:54.208 --> 51:55.666
What is he waiting for?

51:55.666 --> 51:59.208
<i>John, identify the target,
but do not engage.</i>

51:59.750 --> 52:00.958
I love you too.

52:02.000 --> 52:03.666
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.291
All right, all right, Luther's on foot

52:14.291 --> 52:17.250
<i>in Soho en route to Piccadilly Circus.</i>

52:17.250 --> 52:18.166
Stay on him.

52:53.958 --> 52:55.416
Go.

53:32.166 --> 53:35.666
Okay, that's confirmed.
Luther's at Piccadilly Circus.

53:35.666 --> 53:36.750
<i>Do we take him?</i>

53:36.750 --> 53:38.583
Bravo unit. Ready to engage.

53:38.583 --> 53:40.625
Wait for Luther to ID a suspect,

53:40.625 --> 53:42.125
<i>then move in and take them both.</i>

53:42.125 --> 53:43.083
Received.

54:38.583 --> 54:39.708
Who is this?

54:40.208 --> 54:41.583
<i>You know who it is.</i>

54:43.333 --> 54:44.166
Move!

54:44.166 --> 54:45.250
Excuse me. Hey!

54:45.250 --> 54:46.541
Oh!

54:46.541 --> 54:48.250
- Stand back! Police!

54:48.250 --> 54:50.125
- Go, go, go, go!
- That's it. Let's go.

54:51.041 --> 54:52.833
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

54:52.833 --> 54:54.000
Stop! Stop!

54:55.625 --> 54:57.333
- Back.
- All right, just look at me.

54:57.333 --> 54:58.500
- Back! Back!
- Whoa.

54:59.166 --> 55:00.291
Go, go, go, go!

55:00.875 --> 55:02.291
-  All right.
- Back.

55:02.291 --> 55:04.791
- Okay. Just relax. Stop, stop, stop!
- Back.

55:05.791 --> 55:08.000
It's over now. All right. It's over now.

55:08.000 --> 55:11.333
Yeah? Well, why...
Why would you say that?

55:12.000 --> 55:14.166
It's just about to get started.

55:31.125 --> 55:32.083
What's going on?

55:32.666 --> 55:33.625
Wait for it.

55:44.333 --> 55:46.708
- Bong.

55:56.666 --> 55:58.208
What are you doing? Call it off.

56:06.791 --> 56:08.416
- Bong!

56:21.625 --> 56:24.458
-  Move!
-  Armed police, get back!

56:24.458 --> 56:25.458
Do you see me now?

56:27.166 --> 56:28.750
Can you see me now?

56:29.333 --> 56:31.333
Armed police! Stand back!

56:32.833 --> 56:34.416
Down on the ground, now!

56:35.958 --> 56:38.958
- Do not move. On the ground!
- Armed police!

56:40.375 --> 56:41.833
Both of you on the ground now!

56:42.583 --> 56:43.500
All right!

56:43.500 --> 56:46.125
-  Down on the ground!

56:56.250 --> 56:57.250
Get out of the way!

57:08.583 --> 57:09.583
Oi!

57:17.500 --> 57:19.125
Sorry. Move! Move!

57:31.791 --> 57:34.000
Out the way! Out the way!

57:49.541 --> 57:51.125
<i>The train is now ready to depart.</i>

57:51.125 --> 57:54.083
<i>Mind the doors, please.
Mind the closing doors.</i>

58:02.291 --> 58:04.041
For fuck's sake.

58:59.708 --> 59:02.375
Possible sighting.
Attempting to intercept.

1:00:11.708 --> 1:00:12.583
Oh!

1:00:18.166 --> 1:00:19.333
- Argh!

1:00:40.833 --> 1:00:42.041
Armed police!

1:00:42.708 --> 1:00:47.416
Police! Police!
Do not move! Police!

1:00:47.416 --> 1:00:49.791
Come here! Come here and cuff him!

1:00:50.583 --> 1:00:51.583
Police! Do not move!

1:00:51.583 --> 1:00:54.208
Just fucking cuff him first,
and then get me.

1:00:54.791 --> 1:00:55.666
Oh!

1:00:55.666 --> 1:00:57.708
-  Do not move! Do not!
- Okay

1:00:57.708 --> 1:01:00.541
- On your face. On your face!
- All right.

1:01:01.333 --> 1:01:02.208
Shit!

1:01:02.791 --> 1:01:04.541
Ah! Wait!

1:01:13.333 --> 1:01:14.250
Shit!

1:01:14.250 --> 1:01:17.500
- All right, mate. All right, mate.
- Shit.

1:01:17.500 --> 1:01:20.041
- All right. Now, what's your name, pal?
- Jamal.

1:01:20.041 --> 1:01:22.250
Jamal? Listen to me.
Look at me in the eyes.

1:01:22.250 --> 1:01:25.666
Will you look at me? All right, calm down
while I take a look at your leg.

1:01:25.666 --> 1:01:27.500
- Armed police! Back away!
-  Relax.

1:01:27.500 --> 1:01:30.500
- Move away!
-  Mate, do me a favor and listen.

1:01:30.500 --> 1:01:33.250
You can put the cuffs on me
as long as I can sort out Jamal.

1:01:33.250 --> 1:01:36.333
Just give me a hand here, all right?
Come on. Come here now.

1:01:36.333 --> 1:01:38.750
- Freddie, Freddie!
- If you got any gauze, you'll need it.

1:01:38.750 --> 1:01:40.833
- Got some here.
- I got cut, Freddie. I got cut.

1:01:40.833 --> 1:01:43.083
- It's all right. Just relax there, pal.
- Really bleeding.

1:01:43.083 --> 1:01:45.125
-  He's cut an artery.
- Fucking hell.

1:01:45.125 --> 1:01:47.625
Never mind, put the whole thing in there.

1:01:47.625 --> 1:01:51.166
- Seriously, mate. Stay still, all right?
- DCI Luther.

1:01:51.166 --> 1:01:53.375
- Yes, mate.
-  I'm sorry I hit you.

1:01:53.375 --> 1:01:55.791
You hit me.
It's all right 'cause I'm a wanted man.

1:01:55.791 --> 1:01:57.375
Of course you can hit me.

1:01:58.416 --> 1:02:00.375
Jesus!

1:02:01.458 --> 1:02:03.375
I did a job with you back in the day.

1:02:03.375 --> 1:02:06.041
Did ya? On what? Put pressure on that.

1:02:06.041 --> 1:02:08.375
- Cameron Pell.
- Cameron Pell?

1:02:08.375 --> 1:02:10.833
- A school bus and all that malarkey.
- Yeah?

1:02:10.833 --> 1:02:13.375
I remember you. Yeah.
You did some good work on that one.

1:02:13.375 --> 1:02:15.541
- Really good work. You did good.
- Yeah...

1:02:16.041 --> 1:02:17.875
- Sir, you need to go now.
- He's gonna fade fast...

1:02:17.875 --> 1:02:19.125
Leg it. Leg it!

1:02:19.125 --> 1:02:21.041
- What? I can't leave you.
- Go now!

1:02:21.041 --> 1:02:23.375
Go! Go! I'm fine. I'm all right.

1:02:26.666 --> 1:02:28.500
Look, Freddie's got this. Right, Fred?

1:02:29.333 --> 1:02:31.541
- Yeah, yeah, I got this. Go.
-  So go.

1:02:31.541 --> 1:02:33.916
- Freddie?
- Give him a dig from me. Go.

1:02:33.916 --> 1:02:36.333
- Just go.
-  Listen, you're a good cop, okay?

1:02:37.791 --> 1:02:40.666
Jamal, calm down, mate.
It's all right. Help is on the way.

1:02:40.666 --> 1:02:41.833
Off... Officer injured!

1:02:42.708 --> 1:02:46.208
Jamal. Jamal! Wake up! Fuck's sake.

1:02:46.208 --> 1:02:48.541
Jamal. Officer injured!

1:03:00.125 --> 1:03:03.333
I thought the fucker was in prison.

1:03:03.958 --> 1:03:05.416
Yeah, not anymore.

1:03:07.958 --> 1:03:10.083
How much of a problem is this gonna be?

1:03:10.083 --> 1:03:11.583
<i>Uh, I don't know.</i>

1:03:11.583 --> 1:03:14.166
- It's been a big fucking problem so far.
<i>- So...</i>

1:03:15.708 --> 1:03:17.625
Look after it for me.

1:03:18.500 --> 1:03:20.666
I mean, this is a big day for me, Archie.

1:03:20.666 --> 1:03:22.708
What the fuck does that mean?

1:03:22.708 --> 1:03:24.583
<i>Just look after it, will ya?</i>

1:03:26.250 --> 1:03:29.041
You know what's
gonna happen, don't you? Hmm?

1:03:29.833 --> 1:03:35.333
Imagine your wife's face
when she hears about what you did.

1:03:35.916 --> 1:03:38.250
<i>People that you work with. Hmm?</i>

1:03:39.083 --> 1:03:40.416
<i>The judge.</i>

1:03:40.416 --> 1:03:43.416
Oh my God, your mum.

1:03:49.291 --> 1:03:51.666
- Everything all right?
-  Uh...

1:03:52.250 --> 1:03:55.333
No. Your friend's giving me conniptions.

1:03:55.333 --> 1:03:59.458
Ah. Yes. He'll do that.

1:04:36.708 --> 1:04:37.625
Yes?

1:04:37.625 --> 1:04:38.791
Arkady!

1:04:38.791 --> 1:04:42.833
I need you to go ahead
and get things ready.

1:04:42.833 --> 1:04:44.833
I'm running a few hours late.

1:04:45.416 --> 1:04:47.416
Of course. Is there a problem?

1:04:47.416 --> 1:04:49.000
No. No problem.

1:04:49.625 --> 1:04:53.708
I just need to stop off
and pick up one extra.

1:04:55.708 --> 1:04:57.458
<i>How are we looking otherwise?</i>

1:04:59.333 --> 1:05:01.958
The site's up and counting down.

1:05:02.750 --> 1:05:03.791
They're coming in numbers.

1:05:03.791 --> 1:05:04.916
Whoo!

1:05:05.666 --> 1:05:06.750
Nice one.

1:05:07.583 --> 1:05:10.458
- See you soon then.
<i>- See you soon.</i>

1:05:49.250 --> 1:05:50.500
Quiet, please.

1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:52.250
Quiet!

1:05:53.250 --> 1:05:54.708
<i>John, where are you?</i>

1:05:54.708 --> 1:05:56.750
Do me a favor, boss.
Just put her on, please.

1:06:01.708 --> 1:06:02.791
What do you want, John?

1:06:03.375 --> 1:06:04.333
<i>How is he?</i>

1:06:06.666 --> 1:06:07.791
He died, John.

1:06:09.333 --> 1:06:10.500
<i>You just...</i>

1:06:10.500 --> 1:06:12.916
You couldn't bear
not being in the center of things.

1:06:12.916 --> 1:06:15.208
And now a good man is dead.

1:06:16.166 --> 1:06:17.416
I hope you're proud.

1:06:20.250 --> 1:06:23.625
Look, if you want to bring him in,
you'll have to hold him on the line

1:06:23.625 --> 1:06:25.666
while your officers get on site.

1:06:29.833 --> 1:06:30.875
<i>All right, John.</i>

1:06:32.041 --> 1:06:34.875
Finish what you were
about to say quickly, please.

1:06:34.875 --> 1:06:37.333
<i>What do we know about
the way he selects his victims?</i>

1:06:37.333 --> 1:06:38.625
<i>What do we know about that?</i>

1:06:39.291 --> 1:06:42.458
<i>Sweet Fanny Adams.
Victimology is all over the shop.</i>

1:06:42.458 --> 1:06:43.666
No pattern.

1:06:44.166 --> 1:06:47.041
<i>But there's got to be something in common.
Right? Some attributes.</i>

1:06:47.041 --> 1:06:49.041
Yeah, well, if they do,
only he can see it.

1:06:49.041 --> 1:06:50.791
<i>Yeah, exactly.</i>

1:06:56.583 --> 1:06:58.291
What do we know about the jumpers?

1:06:58.833 --> 1:07:01.583
<i>None of them
were vulnerable in the typical ways.</i>

1:07:01.583 --> 1:07:03.333
<i>Uh, they all had jobs,</i>

1:07:03.958 --> 1:07:07.208
emotional and financial
support structures,

1:07:07.208 --> 1:07:09.250
and they were in the top 5% of earners.

1:07:09.916 --> 1:07:13.416
Yeah. They were good people, weren't they?

1:07:14.041 --> 1:07:15.500
Yes. All right. Explain.

1:07:15.500 --> 1:07:17.333
<i>I mean, it doesn't matter who you are.</i>

1:07:17.333 --> 1:07:20.958
<i>We've all got something that
you don't want anyone else to know about.</i>

1:07:20.958 --> 1:07:24.208
Something you're ashamed of.
It could be something sexual.

1:07:24.208 --> 1:07:26.208
<i>Could be financial. Could be criminal.</i>

1:07:27.208 --> 1:07:31.958
Problem is these days people live
their secret lives out on the internet.

1:07:31.958 --> 1:07:34.833
<i>So I think he's probably lurking,
you know,</i>

1:07:34.833 --> 1:07:36.833
<i>fishing for secrets,</i>

1:07:37.458 --> 1:07:40.416
and I bet he's not going to them.
No, he's not stupid, is he?

1:07:40.416 --> 1:07:43.375
No. He knows
he'll get caught that way. So he's using...

1:07:44.125 --> 1:07:47.250
<i>blackmail to make them come to him.</i>

1:07:50.791 --> 1:07:51.958
Jesus, John.

1:07:53.875 --> 1:07:54.791
All of them?

1:07:54.791 --> 1:07:56.166
<i>Yeah, no, all of them</i>,

1:07:56.750 --> 1:08:02.125
<i>because I think he's probably figured out
that in the right circumstances,</i>

1:08:02.125 --> 1:08:06.833
the fear of shame,
the fear of being called out,

1:08:06.833 --> 1:08:10.666
the fear of being caught is
way more powerful than the fear of death.

1:08:11.500 --> 1:08:13.750
There's no way to get ahead of it.
How do you catch someone

1:08:13.750 --> 1:08:15.000
who can get to anyone?

1:08:16.041 --> 1:08:18.541
He's... [sighs] He's a parasite.

1:08:19.208 --> 1:08:20.750
<i>He's feeding off it.</i>

1:08:27.541 --> 1:08:29.833
He's on Millfield Avenue SE1.

1:08:31.541 --> 1:08:34.083
John. Sorry, are you there?
We'd lost you for a...

1:08:37.375 --> 1:08:38.458
John?

1:08:41.083 --> 1:08:42.083
John?

1:08:56.958 --> 1:08:57.875
Hey, Mum.

1:08:57.875 --> 1:09:00.000
Anya Raine, have you been asleep?

1:09:00.500 --> 1:09:01.625
<i>No.</i>

1:09:02.208 --> 1:09:03.958
Have you been in bed all day?

1:09:03.958 --> 1:09:05.000
No.

1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:07.375
I'm having a bit of a rough go of it
at work today,

1:09:07.375 --> 1:09:10.708
so I might not be able
to drive you tomorrow.

1:09:10.708 --> 1:09:12.666
<i>Yeah, no worries. Okey dokey.</i>

1:09:12.666 --> 1:09:15.000
But you can get an Uber on my account.

1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:17.375
Not an SUV because you are not Rihanna.

1:09:17.958 --> 1:09:20.333
<i>But if I don't get a chance
to speak to you before then,</i>

1:09:21.208 --> 1:09:22.333
good luck.

1:09:23.208 --> 1:09:24.375
I love you.

1:09:24.375 --> 1:09:26.166
<i>- I love you too.</i>
- Also...

1:09:26.166 --> 1:09:29.833
If that kitchen is left in a mess,
I will be very, very salty.

1:09:30.916 --> 1:09:32.583
- Kitchen's spotless.
<i>- All right.</i>

1:09:33.416 --> 1:09:35.500
I love you. Bye.

1:10:02.583 --> 1:10:04.916
Anya.

1:10:10.666 --> 1:10:12.916
Anya.

1:10:33.916 --> 1:10:35.541
Manda, is that you?

1:10:48.458 --> 1:10:49.625
Anya.

1:11:29.416 --> 1:11:30.500
Anya.

1:12:32.541 --> 1:12:33.833
Corinne, I had him.

1:12:35.625 --> 1:12:36.833
I had him.

1:12:43.375 --> 1:12:46.083
Look, I think he knew something, this man.

1:12:46.083 --> 1:12:48.916
I think he knew something about Callum

1:12:49.541 --> 1:12:51.791
that Callum didn't want
anyone else to know.

1:12:53.125 --> 1:12:55.000
Something like what? I don't follow.

1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:57.583
I don't know. Um, maybe he, uh...

1:12:59.125 --> 1:13:00.250
uh, something.

1:13:00.250 --> 1:13:02.041
He stole money, or he cheated.

1:13:02.041 --> 1:13:04.041
- He'd never do anything like that.
- No, no.

1:13:04.041 --> 1:13:08.583
But whatever it was, it was small,
probably, but it mattered to Callum.

1:13:10.500 --> 1:13:13.125
And he agreed to meet this man.

1:13:14.375 --> 1:13:15.541
And pay him off.

1:13:19.708 --> 1:13:23.125
Corinne, um, I know
this is really difficult. Okay?

1:13:23.125 --> 1:13:26.125
And I'm sorry for what I'm about to say.

1:13:36.708 --> 1:13:38.166
I think you know this man.

1:13:40.875 --> 1:13:42.958
I think... I think he's in your life.

1:13:45.708 --> 1:13:47.708
I don't understand what that means.

1:13:48.291 --> 1:13:50.125
It means I need to understand

1:13:50.125 --> 1:13:54.333
if someone new has come into your life
since you lost Callum.

1:13:57.333 --> 1:13:59.208
It would be a friend.

1:13:59.208 --> 1:14:00.208
Um...

1:14:01.458 --> 1:14:04.666
someone that you possibly met
at the support group.

1:14:06.166 --> 1:14:07.875
You could have met him socially.

1:14:09.125 --> 1:14:11.291
He's nice. He's warm.

1:14:12.625 --> 1:14:15.125
He never wants anything back from you.
He, he, he...

1:14:15.125 --> 1:14:18.291
Well, there's Tommy, but it's not him.

1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:21.958
Tommy?

1:14:24.125 --> 1:14:25.708
What can you tell me about him?

1:14:30.083 --> 1:14:33.041
I met him at a support group.

1:14:34.291 --> 1:14:38.708
He lost his wife,
and he lost her in terrible circumstances.

1:14:38.708 --> 1:14:40.083
Really terrible.

1:14:45.791 --> 1:14:47.708
He took me to the prison when I...

1:14:54.083 --> 1:14:55.166
He can't!

1:14:57.583 --> 1:14:58.583
That would be...

1:15:00.458 --> 1:15:03.833
He's been in this house.
He's picked up these photographs.

1:15:03.833 --> 1:15:05.083
He's touched them.

1:15:06.250 --> 1:15:07.750
Commiserated with me.

1:15:13.041 --> 1:15:15.541
Please tell me he's not that cruel.

1:15:18.333 --> 1:15:19.625
John, please.

1:15:23.208 --> 1:15:26.000
I need to use your phone. Can I do that?

1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:28.291
Yeah, it's in there.

1:15:34.625 --> 1:15:36.791
<i>♪ How I need you ♪</i>

1:15:37.333 --> 1:15:39.833

1:15:40.875 --> 1:15:43.083

<i>We've been

1:15:59.750 --> 1:16:01.000
John was right.

1:16:02.125 --> 1:16:05.333
At least five of them
have been in some way

1:16:05.333 --> 1:16:07.791
befriended by a man in his 40s.

1:16:07.791 --> 1:16:09.458
Different names,

1:16:09.458 --> 1:16:12.791
but the same approximate age,
height, and general description.

1:16:13.500 --> 1:16:15.833
- Any of the names check out?
- No.

1:16:16.958 --> 1:16:18.291
Not as such,

1:16:18.291 --> 1:16:20.583
but each of these men
claims to have a wife

1:16:20.583 --> 1:16:23.750
who burned to death
in a house fire in Eccleston Square.

1:16:23.750 --> 1:16:28.750
Dates given vary from 2007
to the present day.

1:16:29.500 --> 1:16:30.583
Good work.

1:16:57.250 --> 1:16:59.208
Anya, sweetheart. I can't talk right now.

1:16:59.208 --> 1:17:01.125
<i>Mum! Mum!</i>

1:17:05.208 --> 1:17:06.125
Anya.

1:17:11.291 --> 1:17:12.250
Anya.

1:17:18.916 --> 1:17:20.750
<i>Mum...</i>

1:17:24.500 --> 1:17:27.458
Don't you fucking touch her.
I'll fucking kill you, you piece of shit.

1:17:27.458 --> 1:17:32.083
- If you touch one hair on her head...
- Shh. Shush, shush now, shush.

1:17:32.916 --> 1:17:35.083
Do you know my name, Odette?

1:17:37.541 --> 1:17:38.750
Yes.

1:17:38.750 --> 1:17:40.083
<i>Have you told anyone?</i>

1:17:42.125 --> 1:17:44.625
- No.
- Good. Let's keep it that way, please.

1:17:45.333 --> 1:17:47.083
Would you like your daughter back?

1:17:49.791 --> 1:17:51.833
Fuck you. Yes.

1:17:51.833 --> 1:17:55.750
Then I'd like you to deal with
this Luther issue for me, please.

1:17:57.166 --> 1:17:59.916
<i>Do you think you can do that for me
to get Anya back?</i>

1:18:00.541 --> 1:18:04.333
<i>Because I'd like you
to imagine something for me,</i>

1:18:04.333 --> 1:18:06.833
if you would, Odette.

1:18:06.833 --> 1:18:10.250
I would like you to imagine...

1:18:11.916 --> 1:18:15.041
<i>the pain I could put you through</i>

1:18:15.041 --> 1:18:20.500
when I am enjoying myself with her.

1:18:34.125 --> 1:18:36.250
Archie's right. It's a dead end.

1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:38.541
Odette, you're wrong.

1:18:39.041 --> 1:18:41.833
- It's got legs. It's good.
- No. It's a chimera.

1:18:41.833 --> 1:18:44.083
Just a pattern in the noise. Listen...

1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:47.250
You're a great help, Martin,
but it hasn't worked out.

1:18:47.250 --> 1:18:50.000
So you are free to go with our gratitude.

1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:52.458
I will call you if we need you again.

1:18:53.708 --> 1:18:55.791
- Odette, I...
- We're done. Thank you.

1:19:00.041 --> 1:19:01.375
So what we got?

1:19:01.375 --> 1:19:02.666
<i>You were right.</i>

1:19:02.666 --> 1:19:05.291
<i>He's worked his way into their lives,
befriended them.</i>

1:19:05.291 --> 1:19:06.291
All right.

1:19:07.125 --> 1:19:08.041
Have we got a name?

1:19:08.541 --> 1:19:09.750
<i>Yeah, we got a name.</i>

1:19:11.250 --> 1:19:12.125
Okay. Who is he?

1:19:12.125 --> 1:19:13.875
I'm not going to tell you that, John.

1:19:13.875 --> 1:19:16.833
Can't have you pitching up at the arrest
turning everything into a circus.

1:19:16.833 --> 1:19:18.916
- I don't want that either.
<i>- Fine.</i>

1:19:18.916 --> 1:19:20.083
- I just...
<i>- I owe you.</i>

1:19:20.083 --> 1:19:22.458
<i>So you agree to meet me
at a place of my choosing.</i>

1:19:22.458 --> 1:19:25.916
<i>I want you cuffed in the back of my car.
No tricks. No games.</i>

1:19:26.625 --> 1:19:29.125
You can witness the arrest
before I hand you in.

1:19:29.625 --> 1:19:33.291
This is an offer, a one-time offer,
and it ends in five seconds.

1:19:36.666 --> 1:19:37.500
Can I trust you?

1:19:39.416 --> 1:19:40.875
Think we're past that now, aren't we?

1:19:44.041 --> 1:19:46.375
Right. Okay, yeah, fine.
But I choose the place.

1:20:22.166 --> 1:20:23.666
Evening, sir. What can I get you?

1:20:24.625 --> 1:20:26.375
Oh, I don't know. It's been a long day.

1:20:26.375 --> 1:20:28.583
What do you suggest?

1:20:29.083 --> 1:20:32.291
- I'd say a long day calls for a martini.
- No.

1:20:33.083 --> 1:20:37.541
Whiskey? We have an 18-year-old
Glenmorangie, uh, Tullamore Dew.

1:20:38.375 --> 1:20:39.791
I'll have a glass of water.

1:20:43.833 --> 1:20:47.750
If it makes you happy,
you can make it fizzy.

1:21:09.833 --> 1:21:10.958
DCI Raine.

1:21:13.958 --> 1:21:14.916
So who is he then?

1:21:14.916 --> 1:21:16.500
- I'll tell you in the car.
- Nah.

1:21:17.875 --> 1:21:19.041
Nah.

1:21:19.041 --> 1:21:20.000
Fine.

1:21:23.833 --> 1:21:26.416
Name's David Robey, city trader.

1:21:26.416 --> 1:21:29.125
Suspected aggravated sexual assault
six years ago.

1:21:29.125 --> 1:21:30.416
Never proven.

1:21:30.416 --> 1:21:32.625
A few months later,
his wife's planning to leave him

1:21:32.625 --> 1:21:34.625
until she's injured in a fire.

1:21:34.625 --> 1:21:37.083
Suspected arson. Never proven.

1:21:38.791 --> 1:21:40.166
Did the wife survive?

1:21:40.166 --> 1:21:41.875
If you want to call it that.

1:21:53.583 --> 1:21:54.500
Where's your car?

1:21:54.500 --> 1:21:56.208
Around the corner. Next right.

1:22:18.375 --> 1:22:19.208
Odette.

1:22:19.208 --> 1:22:20.666
Just walk to the car.

1:22:20.666 --> 1:22:22.083
What has he got on you?

1:22:23.875 --> 1:22:26.166
- What has he got on you?
- My daughter. So...

1:22:31.750 --> 1:22:32.666
- In.
-  Raine...

1:22:32.666 --> 1:22:33.583
In.

1:22:33.583 --> 1:22:35.958
If you do this for him,
you'll never get her back.

1:22:35.958 --> 1:22:38.625
- You must know that.
- I'll tell you what I know. I'll tell you.

1:22:38.625 --> 1:22:41.500
I know he never would have taken her
if you hadn't gotten involved.

1:22:41.500 --> 1:22:43.458
No. He'd done it anyway
as soon as you got close.

1:22:43.458 --> 1:22:45.791
He'd use her to control you,
which is what he's doing now.

1:22:45.791 --> 1:22:49.375
- Enough. Get in the fucking car.
- She's alive right now. Okay.

1:22:52.125 --> 1:22:54.875
He will kill her as soon as it suits him.

1:22:55.375 --> 1:22:57.458
- I said, "enough."
- And you'll be alive.

1:22:58.125 --> 1:23:00.083
- And he'll love that, so that you...
- Shut up.

1:23:00.083 --> 1:23:02.291
- Jesus Christ. Put that away.
- Shut up.

1:23:02.291 --> 1:23:04.041
- Get in the car. Get in.
- Put that down.

1:23:04.041 --> 1:23:07.166
He'll love it knowing
you could never admit what you've done.

1:23:07.166 --> 1:23:09.333
- The shame of it. Listen to me.
- Shut up. Shut up.

1:23:09.333 --> 1:23:12.375
He needs you right now,
and he needs your daughter.

1:23:12.375 --> 1:23:13.458
- Jesus!

1:23:13.458 --> 1:23:14.875
Get in the fucking car now!

1:23:14.875 --> 1:23:17.333
- Get in the car!
- I'm just saying we could use that.

1:23:17.333 --> 1:23:20.458
All right? To bring her home.
You and me, we could get her back.

1:23:20.458 --> 1:23:21.708
Odette!

1:23:22.666 --> 1:23:23.708
Ah!

1:23:36.500 --> 1:23:40.333
Okay, so if we do this, no one can know.

1:23:40.333 --> 1:23:41.916
Not, not Schenk, nobody,

1:23:41.916 --> 1:23:43.916
because he's got someone on the inside.

1:23:43.916 --> 1:23:45.333
- I know he does.
- How? How?

1:23:45.333 --> 1:23:47.500
I just know. I know him, okay?

1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:49.000
Get out.

1:24:01.291 --> 1:24:02.333
So what now?

1:24:05.125 --> 1:24:08.333
She's very weak.
It's very difficult for her to talk.

1:24:09.250 --> 1:24:10.291
Thank you.

1:24:13.958 --> 1:24:17.041
Georgette, I'm DCI Raine and this is...

1:24:17.041 --> 1:24:18.958
I'm DCI John Luther.

1:24:20.958 --> 1:24:22.833
I think you know what David's been doing.

1:24:22.833 --> 1:24:25.000
Please leave me alone, please.

1:24:26.833 --> 1:24:28.250
Afraid we can't do that.

1:24:30.458 --> 1:24:32.291
Archie, where's the boss?

1:24:32.291 --> 1:24:33.541
I'm not sure. Why?

1:24:33.541 --> 1:24:36.750
Oh shit. Um, nobody can raise her.

1:24:37.916 --> 1:24:39.625
She's probably chasing a lead. Why?

1:24:39.625 --> 1:24:42.083
Because Luther was right.
Something's coming.

1:24:58.333 --> 1:25:00.541
Jesus holy fucking Christ.

1:25:01.125 --> 1:25:03.750
People on-screen
match people reported missing

1:25:03.750 --> 1:25:06.791
over the last five, six weeks
all over Europe.

1:25:06.791 --> 1:25:08.708
Where's the site hosted? Can we track it?

1:25:08.708 --> 1:25:09.875
No.

1:25:12.875 --> 1:25:13.916
So...

1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:17.333
What... what happens?

1:25:17.750 --> 1:25:19.291
Users get to watch

1:25:19.291 --> 1:25:22.750
and vote for how they want
the victims to be killed.

1:25:26.375 --> 1:25:29.250
Listen, give me a second.
Okay, one second. I'll be right back.

1:25:42.208 --> 1:25:43.375
He's a good man.

1:25:45.833 --> 1:25:48.000
No, he's not a good man.

1:25:54.916 --> 1:25:57.541
I know you think
he sent us here to test you.

1:25:57.541 --> 1:25:58.916
But he didn't.

1:26:04.625 --> 1:26:05.666
Look at me.

1:26:09.333 --> 1:26:12.125
Here. Look at me, please.

1:26:18.125 --> 1:26:21.083
There's no reason on this earth
that you should be afraid.

1:26:23.416 --> 1:26:24.458
Not anymore.

1:26:30.083 --> 1:26:31.958
I know you tried to stop him.

1:26:33.708 --> 1:26:35.250
That's why he did this to you.

1:26:41.500 --> 1:26:43.125
We need to know where he is.

1:26:43.875 --> 1:26:48.500
And I know you can tell me that
because I know he enjoys telling you.

1:26:51.625 --> 1:26:53.958
Georgette, he's got my daughter.

1:27:22.833 --> 1:27:24.000
Boss.

1:27:24.625 --> 1:27:25.708
<i>John.</i>

1:27:26.833 --> 1:27:27.833
Where are you?

1:27:28.625 --> 1:27:29.875
In church.

1:27:29.875 --> 1:27:31.708
<i>They serve a nice pint there, do they?</i>

1:27:32.208 --> 1:27:33.166
They do.

1:27:34.166 --> 1:27:36.666
Listen, I'm calling to tell you
that I don't think we're looking

1:27:36.666 --> 1:27:37.958
for just one man.

1:27:37.958 --> 1:27:40.041
<i>I think we're looking for an operation.</i>

1:27:41.375 --> 1:27:42.375
What does that mean?

1:27:43.500 --> 1:27:45.000
They're running a red room.

1:27:45.500 --> 1:27:46.333
Red...

1:27:47.625 --> 1:27:49.791
Red rooms don't exist.

1:27:49.791 --> 1:27:51.833
<i>They're an urban legend.</i>

1:27:51.833 --> 1:27:53.291
Yeah, no, that's the point.

1:27:53.291 --> 1:27:57.250
I think he wants the world to think
he's a nightmare that's come true.

1:27:57.250 --> 1:27:59.583
That he's a bad dream,
and that he can touch

1:27:59.583 --> 1:28:01.500
<i>anyone he wants anywhere he likes.</i>

1:28:02.458 --> 1:28:04.791
Where is it? This red room?

1:28:06.208 --> 1:28:08.166
I... I cannot tell you that.

1:28:08.166 --> 1:28:09.541
I see.

1:28:11.041 --> 1:28:13.333
One last hurrah, is it?

1:28:14.208 --> 1:28:17.291
One last chance
to exercise that death wish

1:28:17.291 --> 1:28:19.708
you've been carrying around for how long?

1:28:20.458 --> 1:28:23.625
Boss, I'm sorry, okay?
I know that I've let you down...

1:28:25.708 --> 1:28:26.666
way too often.

1:28:26.666 --> 1:28:29.083
It wasn't me you let down.

1:28:29.750 --> 1:28:34.583
<i>The tragedy is that you are a better man
than you ever allowed yourself to be.</i>

1:28:50.625 --> 1:28:53.208
Well, look, I'm not going
to ask you to trust me, okay?

1:28:54.166 --> 1:28:56.625
<i>But I am going to ask you
for just one more favor.</i>

1:28:57.541 --> 1:28:58.583
Of course you are.

1:28:59.541 --> 1:29:00.375
<i>What?</i>

1:29:01.083 --> 1:29:02.375
Just check your texts.

1:29:08.291 --> 1:29:09.333
Can you do that?

1:29:11.500 --> 1:29:12.833
<i>How can I not?</i>

1:29:16.625 --> 1:29:17.541
Great.

1:29:57.291 --> 1:30:00.041
All I know is you
asked me to find her, and I found her.

1:30:00.041 --> 1:30:03.000
<i>I set up an alert on her passport,
and she used it.</i>

1:30:03.000 --> 1:30:04.083
<i>Hmm.</i>

1:30:04.583 --> 1:30:05.666
Used it where?

1:30:06.375 --> 1:30:07.416
<i>Passenger ferry</i>

1:30:07.416 --> 1:30:09.500
en route to Norway.

1:30:17.083 --> 1:30:19.375
And the investigation
knows nothing about this?

1:30:19.375 --> 1:30:22.291
<i>Well, that's... that's
a pretty time-limited situation.</i>

1:30:24.208 --> 1:30:25.875
Okay, good.

1:30:27.583 --> 1:30:29.166
Now, listen, Archie.

1:30:29.166 --> 1:30:30.916
No, no, you don't... You listen.

1:30:30.916 --> 1:30:32.291
Listen, listen, listen.

1:30:33.375 --> 1:30:37.000
There's only one person
that could have led DCI Raine to here.

1:30:38.166 --> 1:30:40.250
A woman, inevitably.

1:30:40.875 --> 1:30:44.708
<i>I need you to pay her a little visit.</i>

1:30:45.291 --> 1:30:47.375
<i>Make sure
she doesn't speak to anyone else.</i>

1:30:47.375 --> 1:30:48.666
Look. No. No.

1:30:48.666 --> 1:30:50.708
- Huh? Archie. Archie...
<i>- Please.</i>

1:30:50.708 --> 1:30:53.083
You can't just...
Can't you leave me alone now?

1:30:53.083 --> 1:30:57.208
<i>Listen, mate, you... you have come so far.</i>

1:30:57.208 --> 1:30:58.416
<i>There's no going back.</i>

1:30:58.416 --> 1:31:02.583
So I just want you to do
this one tiny weeny little thing for me.

1:31:03.125 --> 1:31:05.083
Yeah? And then that's it.

1:31:05.083 --> 1:31:07.208
That's it. That's... that's <i>your</i> way out.

1:31:09.583 --> 1:31:15.125
<i>Just think of it is as opening a door
to a future without me in it.</i>

1:31:21.166 --> 1:31:23.958
Odette, are you ready for this?

1:31:24.583 --> 1:31:25.750
I'm doing it. I'm here.

1:31:25.750 --> 1:31:28.083
Yeah? Whatever comes next?

1:31:29.958 --> 1:31:31.041
Do you have kids?

1:31:32.833 --> 1:31:33.666
Um, no.

1:31:33.666 --> 1:31:36.458
No, clearly not, otherwise
you wouldn't have asked the question.

1:31:37.125 --> 1:31:37.958
Ouch.

1:31:38.458 --> 1:31:39.416
Sorry.

1:31:40.708 --> 1:31:41.875
That was unkind.

1:31:46.166 --> 1:31:48.875
There was never enough time
for me and my wife.

1:31:52.750 --> 1:31:54.666
And then time just, um...

1:31:59.208 --> 1:32:00.250
ran out.

1:32:03.250 --> 1:32:04.583
I know you lost her.

1:32:06.166 --> 1:32:07.250
Mm-hmm.

1:32:14.083 --> 1:32:14.916
I don't get it.

1:32:17.083 --> 1:32:17.958
What?

1:32:18.750 --> 1:32:20.708
You seem like such a decent man.

1:32:20.708 --> 1:32:23.041
I don't understand
why you did the things you did.

1:32:24.416 --> 1:32:25.375
Well,

1:32:26.583 --> 1:32:28.125
I couldn't see any other way.

1:32:28.125 --> 1:32:29.083
To do what?

1:32:31.875 --> 1:32:33.166
What had to be done.

1:33:21.666 --> 1:33:22.958
I know. I'm so sorry.

1:33:30.541 --> 1:33:33.375
John told me someone would come for her.

1:33:35.583 --> 1:33:38.083
But he didn't know
who that someone might be.

1:33:40.916 --> 1:33:42.208
Oh, but I knew.

1:33:42.708 --> 1:33:46.875
So what does this man have on you, Archie?

1:33:47.458 --> 1:33:51.708
And how bad could it have been
for you to allow all this?

1:33:57.083 --> 1:33:58.666
You know, the funny thing is...

1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:02.541
it wasn't even that bad.

1:34:04.208 --> 1:34:05.333
Not really.

1:34:32.208 --> 1:34:34.416
According to Georgette,
we're three miles out.

1:35:19.208 --> 1:35:20.625
We're a mile and a half out.

1:36:36.708 --> 1:36:37.916
We can't stop.

1:37:03.041 --> 1:37:05.958
Mum. Mum!

1:37:07.166 --> 1:37:09.041
No, Mum!

1:37:09.041 --> 1:37:11.541
- Baby, no, no, no, no.
-  Odette. Wait. Wait.

1:37:11.541 --> 1:37:15.166
-  Help me!
- Oh my God. Oh my God.

1:37:15.166 --> 1:37:19.208
Mum!

1:37:20.458 --> 1:37:22.875
<i>Someone help me. Help!</i>

1:37:27.083 --> 1:37:29.208
Oh my God!

1:37:36.583 --> 1:37:38.000
Oh no!

1:37:47.291 --> 1:37:48.916
Okay... Hey.

1:37:50.583 --> 1:37:53.625
It should be you! It should be you!

1:37:53.625 --> 1:37:55.125
Oh my God!

1:37:56.375 --> 1:37:58.875
Get out. Get out.
Get out! Get out! Get out!

1:37:58.875 --> 1:38:01.916
Get out! Get out!

1:39:00.875 --> 1:39:02.541
It's not her. John.

1:39:03.791 --> 1:39:05.000
John.

1:40:19.750 --> 1:40:21.750
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

1:40:23.750 --> 1:40:25.583
All right. All... all the cameras are on?

1:40:27.916 --> 1:40:29.416
Are we live streaming?

1:40:30.041 --> 1:40:31.041
No.

1:40:31.791 --> 1:40:33.416
Okay. All right. Let's go.

1:40:50.791 --> 1:40:52.791
<i>And three, two, one.</i>

1:40:54.375 --> 1:40:58.916
<i>Welcome to the Red Bunker.</i>

1:41:02.625 --> 1:41:05.000
All your votes are in and counted,

1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:09.708
and you're probably expecting us
to kick off proceedings with Brigida.

1:41:09.708 --> 1:41:10.625
Actually,

1:41:10.625 --> 1:41:13.833
<i>one of you asked if lovely Jacov</i>

1:41:13.833 --> 1:41:16.916
could skin her like a snake,

1:41:16.916 --> 1:41:19.791
which I... I have to say
really tickled my funny bone.

1:41:20.625 --> 1:41:26.666
But as it happens,
we have a surprise opening act for you

1:41:26.666 --> 1:41:32.208
as tonight's special guest is DCI...

1:41:32.208 --> 1:41:34.541
Well, no, actually he's not DCI anymore.

1:41:34.541 --> 1:41:36.916
John Luther.

1:41:38.291 --> 1:41:40.708
So, John.

1:41:42.125 --> 1:41:44.666
<i>I thought
I'd kick off by asking you as a...</i>

1:41:44.666 --> 1:41:47.416
Well, a bit of an expert
in these things, apparently.

1:41:48.541 --> 1:41:54.333
Do you think I can help being what I am?

1:41:55.541 --> 1:41:59.208
Do you think any of us can?

1:42:01.666 --> 1:42:05.250
Mate, I couldn't give a fucking monkey's.

1:42:19.666 --> 1:42:21.583
No, of course...
Of course you don't.

1:42:23.500 --> 1:42:27.041
Because you have got no idea

1:42:27.041 --> 1:42:29.916
what it's like to be born like us.

1:42:29.916 --> 1:42:30.916
Fuck.

1:42:31.875 --> 1:42:36.791
To live your entire life
not being able to express who you are

1:42:38.666 --> 1:42:43.333
for fear of people like you... policing us.

1:42:49.291 --> 1:42:52.041
But nobody needs
to be alone anymore now, do they?

1:42:52.041 --> 1:42:53.250
Hmm?

1:42:53.250 --> 1:42:55.000
Not even us,

1:42:55.000 --> 1:42:58.916
because we can create a place
where we can all come together

1:42:58.916 --> 1:43:00.750
to express ourselves.

1:43:00.750 --> 1:43:01.750
Ah!

1:43:04.416 --> 1:43:09.875
And to be safe.
To be safe from people like you.

1:43:31.541 --> 1:43:33.583
Mum! Mum!

1:43:34.541 --> 1:43:36.375
- Anya. Honey.
- No!

1:43:36.375 --> 1:43:38.833
- Oh my God. I'm so...
- Please!

1:43:38.833 --> 1:43:40.916
- No! Don't!
- No, no, no! Mum!

1:43:40.916 --> 1:43:42.041
- Please, no!
- Mum!

1:43:43.958 --> 1:43:45.666
You're a fucking piece of work.

1:43:47.541 --> 1:43:49.375
Leave her alone! Leave her!

1:43:49.375 --> 1:43:52.375
No. No, no, no...

1:43:52.375 --> 1:43:54.583
Stop it! Don't. Stop it!

1:43:54.583 --> 1:43:57.666
- Don't fucking touch her! Get it off her!

1:43:57.666 --> 1:43:59.083
Shush, shush.

1:43:59.083 --> 1:44:00.416
Listen.

1:44:00.416 --> 1:44:03.291
Listen. There is
a way out for her from this.

1:44:03.291 --> 1:44:06.000
Fuck you. Get off me. Stop it. Stop!

1:44:08.333 --> 1:44:10.250
Odette, do you actually want to stop this?

1:44:10.250 --> 1:44:13.583
Because you have the power to do that.

1:44:13.583 --> 1:44:16.500
Just say the magic word.

1:44:18.708 --> 1:44:19.541
Stop.

1:44:21.583 --> 1:44:22.416
Please.

1:44:27.791 --> 1:44:31.125
Now, I didn't expect
either of you two

1:44:31.125 --> 1:44:36.083
to pitch up this evening,
but since they have...

1:44:36.083 --> 1:44:37.708
Mum, get us out of here. Mum!

1:44:37.708 --> 1:44:40.583
What I would like to do is...

1:44:41.250 --> 1:44:42.125
Uh...

1:44:43.208 --> 1:44:45.791
Uh...

1:44:51.125 --> 1:44:52.666
I would like you...

1:44:55.166 --> 1:44:56.541
to stab him.

1:44:57.291 --> 1:44:59.791
Hmm. Would you
do that for me, Odette, please?

1:44:59.791 --> 1:45:02.708
Mum. Mum, don't do it. Mum. Mum!

1:45:02.708 --> 1:45:05.625
I... I can't do that. I can't do that.

1:45:05.625 --> 1:45:08.583
You can't? Okay, well,
you know what happens, don't you?

1:45:09.250 --> 1:45:12.625
- No, stop, stop, stop! Please stop.
- Mum!

1:45:12.625 --> 1:45:16.583
Tell him to stop, please!
Tell him to stop, please! Stop!

1:45:20.916 --> 1:45:22.208
Mum!

1:45:23.500 --> 1:45:25.541
- Okay.
- Mum!

1:45:26.500 --> 1:45:27.500
Odette.

1:45:32.916 --> 1:45:34.708
Can you think of a better way?

1:45:36.458 --> 1:45:41.041
Mummy. Mum, don't. Mum!

1:45:41.750 --> 1:45:42.625
Mum!

1:45:51.333 --> 1:45:54.083
-  Anya, close your eyes.
-  Don't, please.

1:45:54.083 --> 1:45:56.208
I said close your eyes.

1:46:01.375 --> 1:46:03.000
Please.

1:46:05.083 --> 1:46:06.333
Just get it on with it.

1:46:06.333 --> 1:46:08.875
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't worry about it. Don't be sorry.

1:46:09.666 --> 1:46:10.750
Do it.

1:46:11.416 --> 1:46:13.250
-  I'm so... I'm so sorry.
- Do it.

1:46:14.000 --> 1:46:15.208
Go on.

1:46:15.208 --> 1:46:16.625
<i>- Okay.</i>
-  <i>Okay.</i>

1:46:16.625 --> 1:46:17.625
<i>Okay.</i>

1:46:24.458 --> 1:46:25.541
There it is.

1:46:31.541 --> 1:46:33.583
Ooh. Whoo.

1:46:34.666 --> 1:46:37.625
You see,
for all their cloying self-righteousness,

1:46:37.625 --> 1:46:41.208
the only difference between them and us

1:46:41.208 --> 1:46:45.041
is who we're allowed to hurt
and under what circumstances.

1:46:46.875 --> 1:46:49.458
Now, how do they
justify that to themselves?

1:46:49.458 --> 1:46:51.458
All the... All the "good people"?

1:46:53.916 --> 1:46:56.416
By telling themselves
that we're the wicked ones.

1:46:57.041 --> 1:47:02.666
Yeah. All them monsters
are telling you all and me

1:47:04.125 --> 1:47:07.083
that we are monsters.

1:47:12.250 --> 1:47:14.541
Okay. [snaps fingers] Good girl.

1:47:15.208 --> 1:47:17.083
- Okay.

1:47:17.083 --> 1:47:18.541
Good girl.

1:47:24.500 --> 1:47:25.583
Mum. Mum.

1:47:30.250 --> 1:47:33.541
Leave her alone!
You prick, leave her alone!

1:47:38.291 --> 1:47:39.208
Ah.

1:47:41.333 --> 1:47:42.666
Now then...

1:47:45.791 --> 1:47:47.125
your turn, mate.

1:47:48.166 --> 1:47:49.583
What I'd like you to do

1:47:50.208 --> 1:47:54.666
<i>is to shatter her left kneecap with that.</i>

1:48:15.708 --> 1:48:16.916
Make it fast.

1:48:17.750 --> 1:48:18.833
Make it fast.

1:48:35.375 --> 1:48:36.541
No.

1:48:38.375 --> 1:48:40.375
- You have to. Please.
- I can't do it. I won't do it.

1:48:40.375 --> 1:48:41.708
Mum! Mum!

1:48:42.250 --> 1:48:43.583
They'll kill her. Please.

1:48:43.583 --> 1:48:45.708
Every one of you
that are watching this right now,

1:48:45.708 --> 1:48:48.083
your IP addresses are being traced,

1:48:48.083 --> 1:48:50.625
and the police are on their way to you.

1:48:50.625 --> 1:48:52.416
If I were you, I'd get out of here.

1:48:52.916 --> 1:48:54.333
It's okay. It's okay.

1:48:54.333 --> 1:48:57.916
This, this by the way,
is a convicted ex-copper.

1:48:57.916 --> 1:49:00.750
- He has no idea what he's talking about.
-  Not true.

1:49:00.750 --> 1:49:04.041
All the evidence
will be incinerated after the show.

1:49:04.041 --> 1:49:09.125
You're safe. You're in a safe place,
nobody knows that we're here.

1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:11.541
Except for Georgette.

1:49:14.250 --> 1:49:17.041
Yeah, she's alive. Alive and well.

1:49:17.750 --> 1:49:20.500
And not only that,
she told the police where this place is,

1:49:20.500 --> 1:49:23.875
and they're on their way here, and
they're very, very pissed off with you.

1:49:24.458 --> 1:49:26.833
She's probably watching on
one of these cameras now

1:49:26.833 --> 1:49:28.958
and watching your stupid little face

1:49:28.958 --> 1:49:32.250
after telling us
all your embarrassing secrets.

1:49:34.208 --> 1:49:37.958
Everyone can see you,
but they can't see you like we can,

1:49:39.083 --> 1:49:40.333
David Robey.

1:49:41.041 --> 1:49:45.916
We know who you are
and who you are ashamed of being.

1:49:53.541 --> 1:49:55.250
Are you still grinding your teeth?

1:49:58.291 --> 1:50:00.916
From the anxiety.
Are you still doing that?

1:50:00.916 --> 1:50:03.041
- Is that what she said?
- That's what she said.

1:50:03.041 --> 1:50:07.541
You ground your teeth most of your life,
and you never managed to get ahold of it

1:50:07.541 --> 1:50:10.791
because you're an anxious man.
Anxious, weak, pathetic man.

1:50:10.791 --> 1:50:12.541
- Is that what she said?
-  Yes.

1:50:12.541 --> 1:50:14.500
You're doing it now.
He's doing it now.

1:50:14.500 --> 1:50:16.916
You can't see it,
but he's grinding his teeth.

1:50:16.916 --> 1:50:21.541
I do actually remember you
when you stood by me at a bus stop

1:50:21.541 --> 1:50:23.208
and offered me some Juicy Fruit.

1:50:23.208 --> 1:50:24.166
I remember that.

1:50:24.166 --> 1:50:27.458
I thought, "What a sweaty, anxious twat.
What is wrong with him?"

1:50:33.375 --> 1:50:36.125
John! John, go. Go!

1:50:41.458 --> 1:50:43.000
Ah! Go, go, go!

1:50:58.458 --> 1:50:59.791
It's all right. It's okay.

1:50:59.791 --> 1:51:02.333
Hey, hey, we're gonna go home right now.

1:51:02.333 --> 1:51:04.583
We're going home. Okay, all right? Okay.

1:51:07.708 --> 1:51:09.958
We have to go. Come on. Come on.

1:51:09.958 --> 1:51:12.375
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1:51:12.375 --> 1:51:13.333
Okay...

1:51:23.916 --> 1:51:26.625
I need you to get away from that valve.
It's kerosene.

1:51:27.166 --> 1:51:30.083
If you don't get away from that valve,
we're all gonna burn.

1:51:30.083 --> 1:51:31.500
I'd rather burn.

1:51:37.833 --> 1:51:40.708
Get on your knees
and hands behind your head. Now!

1:51:42.041 --> 1:51:44.291
-  Get back!
- Get down on your knees.

1:51:44.291 --> 1:51:45.708
- Ah!

1:52:14.250 --> 1:52:16.583
No! It's locked!

1:52:22.708 --> 1:52:23.583
Help.

1:52:23.583 --> 1:52:26.916
- Hey, hey, hey, open the door!
- Open the door, please.

1:52:26.916 --> 1:52:29.208
- Shh. Shh.

1:52:29.208 --> 1:52:30.250
Help, please!

1:52:44.708 --> 1:52:47.041
Mum, I can't turn it!

1:52:48.791 --> 1:52:49.625
No! Don't!

1:52:59.000 --> 1:53:00.166
Mum!

1:53:20.375 --> 1:53:21.291
Ah!

1:54:44.750 --> 1:54:45.583
Get that!

1:55:12.875 --> 1:55:14.000
Oh!

1:55:16.166 --> 1:55:17.458
No. No.

1:56:06.125 --> 1:56:08.041
Good. Spray.

1:57:50.541 --> 1:57:52.666
- This way.
-  Thank you.

1:57:52.666 --> 1:57:54.625
I'm okay. Can you take her, please?

1:58:03.625 --> 1:58:06.541
Yeah, I'm okay. Yeah. Yeah.

1:58:16.625 --> 1:58:17.875
Wotcha.

1:58:19.458 --> 1:58:21.916
Evidently, I owe you £20.

1:58:23.208 --> 1:58:24.416
It's 50.

1:58:24.416 --> 1:58:26.666
- Ah yes.
- Yeah.

1:58:27.208 --> 1:58:29.166
- I hoped you'd forgotten.
- No.

1:58:43.291 --> 1:58:44.291
Thank you.

1:59:00.666 --> 1:59:03.041
You know what has to happen next, John.

1:59:32.916 --> 1:59:36.833
<i>...has been named as John Luther,
an ex-Metropolitan Police detective</i>

1:59:36.833 --> 1:59:40.333

life-threatening injuries</i>

<i>after allegedly tracking the suspect...</i>

2:00:41.208 --> 2:00:43.000
- Wotcha.
- Wotcha.

2:00:45.625 --> 2:00:46.791
So where am I?

2:00:47.333 --> 2:00:50.083
Ah. Safe house. Evidently.

2:00:52.041 --> 2:00:53.625
- Government?
- Government.

2:00:59.375 --> 2:01:01.708
I think they got most of the blood out.

2:01:02.416 --> 2:01:04.416
Nice piece of invisible mending.

2:01:13.750 --> 2:01:14.750
Who is this lot?

2:01:16.625 --> 2:01:19.791
Uh, not quite sure, to be honest.

2:01:23.458 --> 2:01:25.625
But I don't think
you're going back to prison.

2:01:34.708 --> 2:01:38.666
- A job offer, perhaps?

2:01:46.666 --> 2:01:47.500
If I may.

2:01:49.083 --> 2:01:50.333
Unofficially...

2:01:52.083 --> 2:01:54.041
you did a commendable job.

2:02:01.083 --> 2:02:02.583
So now what?
