00:01.369 --> 00:03.104
Previously on Scorpion...
(all clamoring, laughing)

00:03.137 --> 00:06.107
Mark Collins? Are you insane?

00:06.140 --> 00:08.042
He was a member of the team,
it didn't work out.

00:08.076 --> 00:10.411
Kicking me off Scorpion--
it was a deep betrayal.

00:10.444 --> 00:14.148
I now pronounce you
husband and wife. (laughs)

00:14.182 --> 00:17.051
Well, it's about
damn time.

00:19.087 --> 00:21.122
We've waited a
long time for this.

00:21.155 --> 00:23.157
Buckle up, nerd.

00:25.326 --> 00:27.328
(typing)

00:31.732 --> 00:33.767
Walter?

00:33.801 --> 00:37.571
Last night was worth
waiting three years for, huh?

00:38.572 --> 00:40.574
How do you feel
this morning?

00:44.345 --> 00:46.347
How do I feel?

00:47.581 --> 00:50.184
I feel like...

(needle scratches) Good morning,
Walter, I brought bagels.

01:15.576 --> 01:18.746
No time for bagels.
I'm doing a musical number.

A musical?

Walter.

02:21.642 --> 02:22.810
Walter.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.812
I asked you

02:24.845 --> 02:26.747
how do you feel this morning?

02:26.780 --> 02:28.882
Sorry.

02:28.916 --> 02:30.284
I feel like...

02:30.318 --> 02:32.753
(phone rings)

02:32.786 --> 02:34.888
Sorry.

02:34.922 --> 02:36.390
Hello.

02:36.424 --> 02:38.392
MALE VOICE:
You are receiving a call from

02:38.426 --> 02:39.493
a federal correctional facility.

02:39.527 --> 02:41.395
Please hold for...

02:41.429 --> 02:44.698
COLLINS:
Mark Collins.

02:44.732 --> 02:47.568
SYLVESTER: Man, is it good
to be back at the Chest.

02:47.601 --> 02:48.936
Ah.

02:48.969 --> 02:51.339
Pale Hawk.
(caws)

02:52.240 --> 02:53.741
And who's this?

02:53.774 --> 02:56.477
Um, Sylvester
the Conquester,

02:56.510 --> 02:57.711
meet Sir Thomas Foolery.

02:57.745 --> 03:00.714
Your reputation precedes you.

03:00.748 --> 03:02.550
Tommy Fargas?

03:02.583 --> 03:03.851
You're my pharmacist.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.622
And is that my Stone of Valor?

03:10.324 --> 03:11.492
Kinda.

03:11.525 --> 03:12.726
You guys replaced me

03:12.760 --> 03:14.495
and took all my accoutrements?

03:14.528 --> 03:15.929
Uh, everyone thought
you were dead.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.798
Look-- we made a shrine.

03:20.468 --> 03:22.570
Oh. Thanks, fellas.

03:22.603 --> 03:23.804
Is that my obituary?

03:27.841 --> 03:30.511
"Sylvester Dudd, 24..."

03:30.544 --> 03:32.480
Dudd. Classic.

03:32.513 --> 03:33.947
Typo.
"...died in a plane crash

03:33.981 --> 03:36.850
"this week.
An enthusiastic fantasy player,

03:36.884 --> 03:39.620
"skilled mathematician,
and more.

03:39.653 --> 03:41.955
He will be missed."

03:41.989 --> 03:45.593
My life boils down to
"enthusiastic" and "skilled"?

03:45.626 --> 03:47.395
"And more."
(phone ringing)

03:49.997 --> 03:52.466
Hello, Walter?
Yes, I will

03:52.500 --> 03:54.635
drop Ralph off at school
and be right there.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.337
What is it?
Trouble.

03:56.370 --> 03:58.606
TOBY: Santa Barbara,
here we come. Oh, oh--

03:58.639 --> 03:59.707
is that the bag
with the accoutrements?

03:59.740 --> 04:01.041
Oh, you mean weird outfits

04:01.074 --> 04:03.877
to stimulate your pervert mind?
Yeah.

04:03.911 --> 04:05.613
All packed.
Sweet.

04:05.646 --> 04:07.548
Look, I know it's not
the Tahitian honeymoon

04:07.581 --> 04:09.450
that we hoped for,
and our credit cards are

04:09.483 --> 04:12.019
gonna be bursting at the seams,
but, look, after almost dying

04:12.052 --> 04:14.522
in the South Pacific,
small hotel near the beach--

04:14.555 --> 04:16.290
that's good enough for me.

04:16.324 --> 04:18.892
(phone rings)

04:18.926 --> 04:20.761
Uh, it's Walter.

04:20.794 --> 04:22.663
Don't get it.
It could be work.

04:22.696 --> 04:23.764
That's why I said don't get it.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.033
Hey, what's up?

04:27.501 --> 04:29.403
Are you kidding?

04:29.437 --> 04:30.938
All right, we'll
be there soon.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.806
Our honeymoon's a done-e-moon.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.908
Ga-doy. Why do you think
I'm removing the accoutrements

04:34.942 --> 04:36.944
from the car? It's worse
than missing our trip.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.679
Walt got a call from Collins.

04:38.712 --> 04:40.481
Collins? Why the hell is
Collins calling Walter?

04:40.514 --> 04:41.649
WALTER:
He had...

04:41.682 --> 04:43.651
an Archimedes moment.
A what?

04:43.684 --> 04:45.886
Archimedes is credited
as the first to shout "eureka"

04:45.919 --> 04:48.556
when he discovered a method
for determining gold purity,

04:48.589 --> 04:50.090
(lock buzzes) so when one
of us has a breakthrough,

04:50.123 --> 04:52.560
a real paradigm shift,
it's an Archimedes moment.

04:52.593 --> 04:54.562
Guy's nuts.
I don't care if he

04:54.595 --> 04:56.664
has an Archimedes moment
or a Kodak moment.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.098
He would never sully
intellectual purity

04:58.131 --> 04:59.700
by declaring a
false Archimedes.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.769
So he's been studying
climatological reports,

05:01.802 --> 05:03.837
title charts,
EPA findings,

05:03.871 --> 05:05.072
seismograph readings,

05:05.105 --> 05:06.940
all from his cell,
and he says

05:06.974 --> 05:08.542
he's found something
very dangerous. (clears throat)

05:08.576 --> 05:09.777
Walter.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.111
Thank you for getting here
so quickly.

05:11.144 --> 05:14.782
There is so much to digest
and so little time.

05:16.484 --> 05:18.819
Just so you know--
I have my firearm.

05:18.852 --> 05:21.355
Just in case
there's any nonsense.

05:21.389 --> 05:23.357
What kind of nonsense
would I possibly try to pull?

05:23.391 --> 05:24.558
The last time
that we were together,

05:24.592 --> 05:27.461
you tried to kill Toby.

05:27.495 --> 05:29.363
Oh, yes. That.

05:29.397 --> 05:32.366
That was very uncouth behavior
on my part.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.300
But, in fairness,

05:33.333 --> 05:35.469
I've been through
extensive therapy here,

05:35.503 --> 05:37.671
and it's done wonders.

05:37.705 --> 05:39.473
Between that...

05:39.507 --> 05:41.609
and my research,

05:41.642 --> 05:43.511
it's really allowed
my sanity to flourish.

05:43.544 --> 05:45.446
Speaking of which,

05:45.479 --> 05:47.448
take a look at this.

05:47.481 --> 05:49.583
Crazy-man wallpaper?

05:49.617 --> 05:52.753
Walter, about 20 days
ago, there was a small

05:52.786 --> 05:55.055
3.4 earthquake in
the Arctic Ocean

05:55.088 --> 05:56.557
right near
the Barents Sea.

05:56.590 --> 05:58.526
Now, since then,
temperatures have been rising

05:58.559 --> 06:00.694
a tenth of a degree
a day above the norm.

06:00.728 --> 06:03.096
I've also seen
slightly elevated tides,

06:03.130 --> 06:04.532
slower wind speeds,

06:04.565 --> 06:06.834
and a shift in bird
migration patterns.

06:08.001 --> 06:10.671
WALTER: Mark, over here.
This is very bad.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.706
Archimedes, right?

06:12.740 --> 06:14.842
Soon it'll be
a quarter of a degree a day.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.777
And then a half a degree...
And then,

06:16.810 --> 06:18.446
in a few weeks, crops die off,

06:18.479 --> 06:19.680
species die off,
satellites stop working

06:19.713 --> 06:21.615
because of atmospheric
interference...

06:21.649 --> 06:23.984
COLLINS: The grid overheats,
there's no potable water,

06:24.017 --> 06:25.519
there's widespread wildfires.

06:25.553 --> 06:27.621
I'm taking photos
and sending them to the team.

06:27.655 --> 06:29.122
Someone want to fill me in?

06:29.156 --> 06:30.624
BOTH:
It's an extinction event.

06:30.658 --> 06:31.792
COLLINS:
Simply put,

06:31.825 --> 06:32.893
the earthquake created

06:32.926 --> 06:34.161
these small fissures in the ice.

06:34.194 --> 06:35.696
Methane that
had been trapped

06:35.729 --> 06:37.798
in that very ice
for millions of years

06:37.831 --> 06:40.968
has begun to escape
into the atmosphere, and...

06:42.703 --> 06:44.572
What is this?

06:46.106 --> 06:47.841
You and the waitress.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.009
I knew that would

06:49.042 --> 06:50.811
come to pass.
Get back to your point.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.480
Now, assume
you've done the math.

06:52.513 --> 06:53.781
What is the timeline?

06:53.814 --> 06:56.149
Uh, well, in...

06:57.485 --> 07:00.454
...30 days, half of life
on Earth is gone.

07:00.488 --> 07:02.222
In 90, all of it.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.657
Except for the insects.

07:03.691 --> 07:06.059
Fellas, this is all
hard to swallow.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.629
Are we talking
theory or guarantee?

07:08.662 --> 07:09.830
It's a guarantee.

07:09.863 --> 07:13.133
Unless we plug the methane
cracks in the next seven days.

07:13.166 --> 07:14.768
What's this "we," pilgrim?

07:14.802 --> 07:16.203
Scorpion can
handle it.

07:16.236 --> 07:17.971
You're a former
team member.

07:18.005 --> 07:20.240
Emphasis on "former."

07:20.273 --> 07:23.243
But Scorpion can't fix
what it can't locate.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.878
Now, I've already
done the calculations

07:24.912 --> 07:26.580
to take you to the exact spot

07:26.614 --> 07:28.482
in the Arctic that
you need to go to.

07:28.516 --> 07:29.950
You could do those
calculations yourself,

07:29.983 --> 07:32.252
but, as Walter'll tell you,

07:32.285 --> 07:35.856
that'll take about ten days
of intensive algorithms, and...

07:35.889 --> 07:38.592
well, you don't have ten days.
Listen close.

07:38.626 --> 07:40.861
You are not leaving this prison.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.663
WALTER:
Cabe.

07:42.696 --> 07:43.997
He's right.

07:44.031 --> 07:48.068
About what's gonna happen
and how we need him.

07:48.101 --> 07:51.672
Looks like new Collins
is going on a little field trip.

07:52.640 --> 07:53.707
I know it sounds insane,

07:53.741 --> 07:55.743
but you haven't been the
Homeland director long enough

07:55.776 --> 07:57.745
to know that insane
is what Scorpion does.

07:57.778 --> 07:58.979
That's right.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.881
I haven't been director
long enough.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.816
Not long enough
to totally unpack.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.818
Not long enough
to prove myself.

08:04.852 --> 08:07.220
Certainly not long enough to
survive the heat I would get

08:07.254 --> 08:09.156
from letting an attempted
murderer out of prison.

08:09.189 --> 08:10.624
Nothing will happen.

08:10.658 --> 08:12.225
I'll ankle Collins to me.

08:12.259 --> 08:13.661
Digital chain gang.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.663
He gets more than
25 feet from my side,

08:15.696 --> 08:17.665
he gets 50,000 volts.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.667
If he's right
and we do nothing,

08:19.700 --> 08:21.168
the world ends
as we know it.

08:21.201 --> 08:22.703
If Collins plays us,

08:22.736 --> 08:24.104
then a con tricked us
to a few days

08:24.137 --> 08:25.673
on the outside.
Big deal.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.140
Fine.

08:27.174 --> 08:30.578
But if things go sideways,
it will be a big deal.

08:30.611 --> 08:33.847
And it'll be your ass
on the line, not mine.

08:40.921 --> 08:42.289
I'm not happy about this.

08:42.322 --> 08:44.191
The world ending
or Collins getting out?

08:44.224 --> 08:47.227
Both equally bad. What if
Collins goes after Toby again?

08:47.260 --> 08:49.663
See how she cares about me?
We haven't moved in fully yet,

08:49.697 --> 08:51.198
and I'm not
doing the rest myself.

08:51.231 --> 08:53.100
Huh?

08:53.133 --> 08:54.668
There was no
time for debate.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.103
Collins knows
where the fissures are located.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.337
He holds the cards.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.606
TOBY:
He's right--

08:58.639 --> 09:00.207
Collins has us by the gooty.

09:00.240 --> 09:03.010
What's a gooty? I'm sorry, it's
my new linguistic experiment.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.078
Remember, I try to bring
back old-timey slang?

09:05.112 --> 09:07.681
Some would say that endeavor
was pure flummery.

09:07.715 --> 09:10.017
Yeah, some would say.
But, sadly, not enough.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.085
So now I'm just trying
to create a single word.

09:12.119 --> 09:13.353
My lexicographical goal

09:13.386 --> 09:14.722
is to get a word added
to the dictionary

09:14.755 --> 09:16.957
simply by releasing it
into common parlance

09:16.990 --> 09:18.191
and seeing if it catches on.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.960
Gooty?
Yeah.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.695
Genitals. Gonads.

09:21.729 --> 09:24.164
If I were to use it
in a sentence, it would be, uh,

09:24.197 --> 09:25.866
"Last night, Walter and Paige

09:25.899 --> 09:27.801
saw each other's..."
We get it.

09:27.835 --> 09:30.838
Understood. My point is everyone's got 'em.
We all got to deal with it.

09:30.871 --> 09:33.841
You'll see, Walt.
Gooty's gonna stick.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.610
That came out wrong.
(lock buzzes)

09:36.644 --> 09:38.378
Hello, friends!

09:38.411 --> 09:39.713
No friends of yours here.

09:39.747 --> 09:41.715
Happy,
I've emotionally prepared

09:41.749 --> 09:42.983
for your response.

09:43.016 --> 09:44.351
I've had much
psychological treatment

09:44.384 --> 09:46.153
since my incarceration,

09:46.186 --> 09:47.921
something I think
you'd appreciate.

09:47.955 --> 09:50.257
I would've appreciated you
not locking me in a warehouse

09:50.290 --> 09:52.125
with acid dangling over my face.

09:52.159 --> 09:53.827
Yes, well...

09:53.861 --> 09:56.296
we have had
our adventures.

09:57.164 --> 09:59.132
Paige.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.734
I was so delighted

10:00.768 --> 10:02.836
to learn of yours
and Walter's coupling.

10:02.870 --> 10:05.005
Gross. No, I-I think
it's delightful.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.808
I mean, a-a genius
finding a life mate is...

10:07.841 --> 10:09.142
so very rare.

10:09.176 --> 10:12.379
And for that life mate
to be normal

10:12.412 --> 10:14.782
is even more rare.
And, as everybody knows,

10:14.815 --> 10:18.118
Walter's integrity is far
too high to only be interested

10:18.151 --> 10:19.319
in the carnal,

10:19.352 --> 10:20.287
so it's...

10:20.320 --> 10:23.256
(grunts)
(electrical buzzing)

10:23.290 --> 10:24.858
Is he having a seizure?

10:24.892 --> 10:26.093
He got juiced.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.961
He's got a stun-cuff
on his ankle.

10:27.995 --> 10:29.997
It pops any time
he gets too far away

10:30.030 --> 10:32.866
from the one that's
locked onto my own leg.

10:32.900 --> 10:35.168
Or if he gets too lippy.

10:35.202 --> 10:36.870
And that,
my friend,

10:36.904 --> 10:39.406
was for disrespecting Paige.
Aah...

10:41.408 --> 10:43.443
Point taken.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.445
Paige, I apologize.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.447
I'm still evolving.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.983
Bet you felt that
in the gooty.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.885
Okay, let's get going
back to the garage.

10:51.919 --> 10:53.186
Every minute counts.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.322
(grunts)
I, uh...

10:55.355 --> 10:58.325
Toby, would you mind
scooching a bit?

10:58.358 --> 11:01.194
Lockup has given me
some shared space issues.

11:01.228 --> 11:03.764
Perhaps I should
tie you to a chair

11:03.797 --> 11:05.165
inside a dental floss maze.

11:05.198 --> 11:06.466
Would that be
more amenable?

11:06.499 --> 11:08.335
Not like I didn't apologize.

11:08.368 --> 11:09.737
No, no, you said
we had an adventure.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.438
My intent was obvious.

11:11.471 --> 11:12.439
Your intent was to kill me.

11:12.472 --> 11:13.340
Okay, I want Collins
in the back.

11:13.373 --> 11:14.607
I'm not comfortable
with him next to Toby.

11:14.641 --> 11:17.077
Thank you, darling. I don't
want him sitting by me either.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.946
Guys... Guys, how do you
think this makes me feel?

11:18.979 --> 11:20.914
Like an unpopular psychopath.

11:20.948 --> 11:21.715
That's unfair.

11:21.749 --> 11:23.751
If the straitjacket fits!
Enough!

11:24.785 --> 11:26.219
We are dealing with

11:26.253 --> 11:27.287
an extinction event.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.356
Are billions of lives
not stakes enough for you

11:29.389 --> 11:31.358
to act semi-normal for a change?

11:33.961 --> 11:35.796
Good.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.965
Let's buckle up.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.166
(engine starts)

11:39.199 --> 11:40.267
Um...

11:40.300 --> 11:41.301
you feeling okay?

11:41.334 --> 11:44.437
Oh, I feel like everything's
absolutely genius.

11:44.471 --> 11:46.473
♪

11:53.446 --> 11:54.414
COLLINS:
My calculations show that

11:54.447 --> 11:56.416
the methane leak
is actually

11:56.449 --> 11:58.151
coming up through
these two ice walls

11:58.185 --> 12:00.353
in an approximately
15-foot crevasse.

12:00.387 --> 12:03.190
"Crevasse"? We're in
America, say "crevice."

12:03.223 --> 12:04.191
You sound pretentious.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.159
Okay, wordsmith,
you know the difference between

12:06.193 --> 12:07.460
"crevasse" and "crevice."

12:07.494 --> 12:08.762
Just let him talk.

12:08.796 --> 12:10.297
Thank you.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.332
So, figure our best bet
is to neutralize the methane.

12:12.365 --> 12:15.302
I thought a nice little
nitrogen hydroxide solution

12:15.335 --> 12:16.303
would do the trick.

12:16.336 --> 12:18.238
Well, we'd need a lot of it.

12:18.271 --> 12:20.373
And a steel drum to hold it in.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.442
And an industrial drill to
bore through the ice fissure,

12:22.475 --> 12:24.211
make the hole big enough
for an I.V.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.378
to feed in nitrogen hydroxide.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.180
I can get us a
military cargo plane

12:27.214 --> 12:28.481
stocked with
whatever you want.

12:28.515 --> 12:29.883
To fly where, exactly?

12:29.917 --> 12:32.219
Yeah, Weirdo Beardo
won't spill the beans.

12:32.252 --> 12:35.455
Oh, yes, we will be going
just outside a remote village

12:35.488 --> 12:37.390
in Northern Norway.

12:37.424 --> 12:38.892
Once there,
we will need

12:38.926 --> 12:40.393
appropriate
transportation.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.195
I'll have Homeland reach out
to the local village.

12:42.229 --> 12:43.396
I'm sure we can
scrounge up

12:43.430 --> 12:45.198
snow terrain vehicles
equipped with

12:45.232 --> 12:47.134
whatever you need
to handle frozen terrain.

12:47.167 --> 12:49.136
Then, all I will need...

12:49.169 --> 12:51.538
is this transistor radio.

12:51.571 --> 12:53.206
We'll pinpoint
the methane,

12:53.240 --> 12:54.341
we'll chemically neuter it,

12:54.374 --> 12:56.409
we'll stop the Earth
from heating up,

12:56.443 --> 12:58.311
and we will save mankind.

12:58.345 --> 12:59.312
Come on, team!

12:59.346 --> 13:00.814
Let's do it!

13:00.848 --> 13:03.183
(electrical buzzing)
(grunts)

13:06.954 --> 13:07.955
(grunts)

13:09.923 --> 13:11.324
(whimpers)

13:11.358 --> 13:13.293
Sorry about that, I, uh...
(laughs)

13:13.326 --> 13:14.962
forgot about the cuff.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.396
Word of advice:

13:16.429 --> 13:18.065
don't forget again.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.843
We've been riding
around for an hour.

13:29.877 --> 13:30.844
What's the plan?

13:30.878 --> 13:32.512
We'll stop soon, just not yet.

13:32.545 --> 13:34.014
Oh, this is great.

13:34.047 --> 13:35.215
We're in the middle
of the tundra

13:35.248 --> 13:36.917
and Collins is trying to
get the ball game.

13:36.950 --> 13:40.921
Actually, Toby, ham radio waves
bounce off the atmosphere.

13:40.954 --> 13:43.390
But their pattern
will be disrupted

13:43.423 --> 13:46.226
by the methane buildup
in the ionosphere.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.628
Literally hear
where the methane is.

13:48.661 --> 13:49.729
TOBY: The whole
reason you got to

13:49.762 --> 13:52.265
tag along is because
you already knew the location.

13:52.299 --> 13:54.034
I know the general area.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.302
I am narrowing.

13:56.269 --> 13:56.937
Just let him concentrate.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.538
Does PANNS mean nothing to you?

13:58.571 --> 14:00.040
Taking his side

14:00.073 --> 14:01.141
violates the "P."

14:01.174 --> 14:02.142
What the hell's "PANNS"?

14:02.175 --> 14:03.010
Don't.
What do you care?

14:03.043 --> 14:05.412
You just flaunt
all its rules anyway.

14:05.445 --> 14:07.147
PANNS is our marital creed.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.315
This shall be delightful.

14:08.348 --> 14:09.316
"P,"

14:09.349 --> 14:10.884
put your partner first.

14:12.252 --> 14:15.588
"A," always strive for
a positive state of mind.

14:15.622 --> 14:17.424
"N," no disparaging

14:17.457 --> 14:18.458
of ideas.

14:18.491 --> 14:20.427
"N," no lying.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.295
And "S," SCABOBI.

14:22.329 --> 14:24.431
"SCABOBI"?

14:24.464 --> 14:25.933
"SCABOBI"? TOBY (over
radio): It stands for

14:25.966 --> 14:27.467
"Steady Calm Attitude Brings

14:27.500 --> 14:28.568
Optimal Bliss Inherently."

14:28.601 --> 14:30.137
Stupidest thing
I ever heard.

14:30.170 --> 14:31.939
We have hacked marriage.

14:31.972 --> 14:33.473
With a simple,
genius five-point tool.

14:33.506 --> 14:34.474
WALTER:
Actually,

14:34.507 --> 14:36.176
it's 11 points: PANN is four

14:36.209 --> 14:38.045
and "SCABOOBI" is
a seven-letter acronym.

14:38.078 --> 14:39.312
"SCABOBI."

14:39.346 --> 14:40.380
(radio crackles)
Stop!

14:40.413 --> 14:41.481
Stop the vehicle.

14:48.956 --> 14:50.958
(radio crackling)

14:50.991 --> 14:52.092
Okay.

14:52.125 --> 14:54.561
Uh... about 100 yards northeast
and we should have it.

14:54.594 --> 14:55.595
Happy?

14:55.628 --> 14:57.030
Goggles.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.301
Yup, I see the leak.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.105
Mark!
PAIGE: He's running away.

15:05.138 --> 15:06.639
(electrical buzzing)
(Collins groans)

15:11.211 --> 15:12.279
(buzzing stops)

15:13.646 --> 15:15.715
(Collins grunting)

15:15.748 --> 15:17.317
Nice try, jackass.

15:17.350 --> 15:18.318
Now I can add

15:18.351 --> 15:20.053
attempted escape to your jacket.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.689
I'm not escaping, we need to
turn the drum upright.

15:22.722 --> 15:25.425
The nitrogen hydroxide
is leaking!

15:25.458 --> 15:27.327
No, no, no, no. No, no.
Yeah. Yeah.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.962
How did this happen?

15:28.996 --> 15:29.929
Oh, you want to know how?

15:29.963 --> 15:32.632
Those morons packed
the cargo plane for us

15:32.665 --> 15:34.667
with a steel alloy drum.

15:34.701 --> 15:35.735
The chemical ate through it?

15:35.768 --> 15:38.138
I specifically
said pure steel.

15:38.171 --> 15:39.359
Well, that's what I told them.
SYLVESTER: Okay,

15:39.384 --> 15:40.373
I'm gonna make some
quick approximations

15:40.407 --> 15:42.642
to see if what we have left
is enough to neutralize

15:42.675 --> 15:43.743
the methane.
Little bit of help?

15:43.776 --> 15:45.745
Yeah, yeah.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.514
(groans)
Talk a sec?

15:47.547 --> 15:49.516
Of course.

15:49.549 --> 15:50.350
PAIGE:
So, uh...

15:50.383 --> 15:53.353
Collins sure is
making things here

15:53.386 --> 15:55.655
a little more
lively than usual, huh?

15:55.688 --> 15:57.724
Yes. I assumed his being here

15:57.757 --> 15:59.392
would stir things up a bit.
Right.

15:59.426 --> 16:00.527
Well, that's why
I'm curious, uh,

16:00.560 --> 16:02.262
why you didn't
check with me first.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.397
Check with you?

16:04.431 --> 16:07.100
Well, I am the...
genius whisperer on the squad.

16:07.134 --> 16:08.635
I'm supposed to manage
what may or may not

16:08.668 --> 16:10.470
knock the gang off-kilter.

16:10.503 --> 16:12.405
So, maybe we could've

16:12.439 --> 16:14.441
discussed it?

16:15.442 --> 16:18.478
Are-are you asking me as...

16:18.511 --> 16:22.315
my girlfriend
or a member of the team?

16:23.316 --> 16:25.618
As a team member, of course.

16:25.652 --> 16:29.056
Yeah, our new relationship
status has no effect

16:29.089 --> 16:30.290
on-on work.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.558
Uh, okay.

16:31.591 --> 16:34.461
Uh, as the founder of Scorpion,

16:34.494 --> 16:37.497
who does and doesn't
get to work on our cases

16:37.530 --> 16:39.766
is 100% my call.

16:39.799 --> 16:42.035
I don't really need to...

16:42.069 --> 16:44.737
check with anyone.

16:46.639 --> 16:48.508
Okay, then.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.743
Yeah. Appreciate the candor.

16:59.852 --> 17:00.820
SYLVESTER:
Okay, so,

17:00.853 --> 17:01.854
based on a rough estimate,

17:01.888 --> 17:02.789
we don't have nearly enough
nitrogen hydroxide

17:02.822 --> 17:05.458
to even make a dent
in a methane pocket

17:05.492 --> 17:07.394
the size that Collins
says we're dealing with.

17:07.427 --> 17:09.729
CABE: So what do we do now?
It's not like we can

17:09.762 --> 17:12.165
drive an hour back to
that Norwegian town

17:12.199 --> 17:14.267
and expect them to have a vat
of the chemicals that we need.

17:14.301 --> 17:16.169
They don't even
have a traffic light.

17:16.203 --> 17:17.670
(sighs) So where do we get
more nitrogen hydroxide?

17:17.704 --> 17:20.207
We've got tundras
to the east and west of us,

17:20.240 --> 17:21.608
a useless town to the south,

17:21.641 --> 17:24.177
and Barents Sea to the north.
We're screwed.

17:24.211 --> 17:25.712
(stammers excitedly)
Not necessarily. The sea!

17:25.745 --> 17:27.447
That could be our salvation.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.349
The mud at the bottom
of the sea

17:29.382 --> 17:31.118
in that region has
methanoperedens.

17:31.151 --> 17:32.152
It's a bacteria.

17:32.185 --> 17:33.286
It eats methane!

17:33.320 --> 17:34.421
And it gives off H2O and O2,

17:34.454 --> 17:35.722
just like the
hydroxide would've.

17:35.755 --> 17:36.689
And if we mix that

17:36.723 --> 17:38.758
with the nitrogen hydroxide
we have left...

17:38.791 --> 17:41.161
The nitrogen will
feed the bacteria!

17:41.194 --> 17:43.430
Like crops in a garden that
feed off nitrogen in fertilizer.

17:43.463 --> 17:44.431
TOBY:
And the bacteria

17:44.464 --> 17:45.832
will multiply expediently.

17:45.865 --> 17:47.734
And within a day, the methane
will be almost depleted.

17:47.767 --> 17:49.836
WALTER: Okay, guys,
here's the plan: Collins,

17:49.869 --> 17:52.439
Toby, Cabe and I
will take that van,

17:52.472 --> 17:53.773
go collect the bacteria.

17:53.806 --> 17:54.841
Happy, Sly and Paige,

17:54.874 --> 17:56.443
you will drill
a hole in the ice

17:56.476 --> 17:58.145
and get the I.V. ready.

17:58.178 --> 17:59.212
Yeah? Let's go.

18:01.781 --> 18:04.617
It's good to be back on the team.
You're not on the team.

18:04.651 --> 18:06.119
I'm kind of on the team.
No, not really.

18:06.153 --> 18:09.689
Are you following PANNS
antagonizing this jerk?

18:09.722 --> 18:10.690
Happy, that's not very SCABOBI.

18:10.723 --> 18:13.793
Uh, I am trying to A,
always keep a positive

18:13.826 --> 18:15.162
frame of mind.

18:15.195 --> 18:17.597
You can't do that if you
refuse to SCABOBI.

18:17.630 --> 18:18.431
WALTER:
Guys?

18:18.465 --> 18:20.367
Shut up. Let's go.

18:21.701 --> 18:25.338
(motor whirring)

18:25.372 --> 18:27.874
SYLVESTER: Drill a hole, pump it
with bacteria, easy peasy.

18:27.907 --> 18:29.242
Though, it makes me nervous

18:29.276 --> 18:30.677
we don't know how much
methane is leaking

18:30.710 --> 18:32.212
through the fissures now.

18:32.245 --> 18:33.813
HAPPY: It's safe
levels for the time

18:33.846 --> 18:35.482
that we'll be down here.
Trust me.

18:35.515 --> 18:38.351
If it were getting bigger,
you'd be getting loopy.

18:38.385 --> 18:40.220
You gonna be careful
with that thing?

18:40.253 --> 18:41.421
I mean, you're basically
drilling into

18:41.454 --> 18:43.523
a giant ball of explosive gas.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.458
Huh. Like Cabe after jerky.

18:48.495 --> 18:50.263
Really?

18:50.297 --> 18:52.832
I crack one joke a year,
and I get nothing.

18:52.865 --> 18:56.736
I'm sorry,
I've just been thinking.

18:56.769 --> 18:58.338
About a lot of things today.

18:58.371 --> 18:59.339
We're geniuses,

18:59.372 --> 19:00.773
we're always thinking
about a lot of things.

19:00.807 --> 19:01.808
What's bothering you?

19:02.842 --> 19:03.810
Hey!

19:03.843 --> 19:04.877
Watch it.

19:04.911 --> 19:06.313
Sorry.

19:06.346 --> 19:07.647
There's one more
generator cable up here.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.316
(rumbling)

19:13.286 --> 19:14.487
Oh...

19:16.323 --> 19:18.691
Earthquake aftershock.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.460
You guys okay?
HAPPY (over radio): Yeah.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.395
Just a little rumbling.

19:22.429 --> 19:23.830
You guys okay down there?

19:23.863 --> 19:25.432
Yeah, we're fine.

19:25.465 --> 19:26.966
Uh, ladder fell off.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.901
We'll never be able to throw
the hooks back at you.

19:28.935 --> 19:30.803
You're gonna have to grab
the cables and carabiners

19:30.837 --> 19:32.839
from the truck,
tie it to the tow rig,

19:32.872 --> 19:33.940
and pull us up when we're done.

19:33.973 --> 19:35.775
PAIGE:
Okay. I'll get on it.

19:35.808 --> 19:36.776
SYLVESTER:
And the pump came apart.

19:36.809 --> 19:39.178
We got to do everything over again.
Good.

19:39.979 --> 19:42.415
Gives us time to talk.

19:42.449 --> 19:44.717
You're down here with me
trying to save the world.

19:44.751 --> 19:46.919
And if your head is somewhere
else other than on task,

19:46.953 --> 19:49.256
we could fail, so spill it,

19:49.289 --> 19:50.590
before I punch you in the gooty.

19:50.623 --> 19:53.293
See? It's catching on.

19:53.326 --> 19:55.862
Okay, I'll tell you, just...
take your comms out.

19:57.997 --> 19:59.732
Okay.

19:59.766 --> 20:00.733
What's your secret?

20:00.767 --> 20:04.304
Today I read my own obituary.

20:04.337 --> 20:05.872
And it was pretty depressing.

20:05.905 --> 20:08.808
Obits aren't really
knee-slappers.

20:08.841 --> 20:10.443
No, I mean it was
short and lame.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.513
And the thing
that hit the most was that

20:13.546 --> 20:14.947
it didn't even mention Megan.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.351
Marrying her was
the most important thing

20:18.385 --> 20:21.421
I ever did in my life.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.890
And after I supposedly died
in a plane crash...

20:26.893 --> 20:28.361
there was no recording of it.

20:28.395 --> 20:29.962
It was like

20:29.996 --> 20:31.764
it never existed.

20:34.501 --> 20:37.570
Like we never existed.

20:37.604 --> 20:41.608
I, um...

20:41.641 --> 20:43.643
I understand why you're upset...

20:43.676 --> 20:45.712
Sorry, I didn't mean
to bring you down.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.581
Start drilling.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.351
(drill powers on)

20:51.384 --> 20:53.386
TOBY:
Uh... according to the GPS,

20:53.420 --> 20:55.422
we're over the sea right now.

20:55.455 --> 20:58.057
Just a quarter mile
from where the ice shelf ends

20:58.090 --> 21:01.294
and the water starts, so the ice
shouldn't be too thick.

21:01.328 --> 21:03.630
We'll only have to lower
the buckets a few feet

21:03.663 --> 21:06.833
to scoop out sea muck, with
all its microbiotic goodness.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.835
Cabe and I will
make a hole right here,

21:08.868 --> 21:10.803
you guys get the buckets ready.

21:10.837 --> 21:13.440
Okay, Paul Bunyan,
let's hit it.

21:19.846 --> 21:22.615
It is so good to be working
with you again, Walter.

21:22.649 --> 21:24.984
And thank you for trusting me.

21:25.017 --> 21:26.819
Believing in my theory.

21:26.853 --> 21:29.389
Not just thinking
I was some crackpot.

21:29.422 --> 21:30.957
Oh, I do think you're
a crackpot.

21:30.990 --> 21:34.327
I also think that
you're brilliant.

21:34.361 --> 21:35.628
And I've weighed
all the factors,

21:35.662 --> 21:40.367
and brilliant beat crackpot
by a... a-a nose.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.702
Well, thank you
for that.

21:42.735 --> 21:45.338
Especially 'cause you seem
to be paying the price for it.

21:45.372 --> 21:46.706
How is that?

21:50.643 --> 21:51.644
Comms.

21:54.947 --> 21:57.484
No, I just meant that I saw
the little tête-à-tête

21:57.517 --> 21:59.686
between you and Paige earlier,

21:59.719 --> 22:01.388
and it looked tense.

22:01.421 --> 22:02.855
It's none of your business.

22:02.889 --> 22:05.091
No, I-I know.
I know it's not.

22:05.124 --> 22:06.826
It's just, when I see
you and Paige,

22:06.859 --> 22:08.728
I see people who need help.

22:08.761 --> 22:11.631
Might be facing an
extinction event of their own.

22:13.466 --> 22:14.567
What do you mean by that?

22:14.601 --> 22:17.604
Walter, it just means that
you have to be very aware

22:17.637 --> 22:20.106
of how different
you and Paige are,

22:20.139 --> 22:22.842
and adjust your
behavior accordingly.

22:22.875 --> 22:25.478
Otherwise, your relationship
is gonna have

22:25.512 --> 22:27.714
the half-life of francium.

22:27.747 --> 22:29.682
22 minutes?

22:29.716 --> 22:32.685
Paige is so sweet
and refreshing.

22:32.719 --> 22:34.053
She's like fruit punch.

22:34.086 --> 22:36.556
And you and your brain

22:36.589 --> 22:39.959
is like a Ferrari engine.

22:39.992 --> 22:43.095
Now, you can't just put
fruit punch in a Ferrari

22:43.129 --> 22:44.597
and expect it to run.

22:44.631 --> 22:46.733
You know?

22:46.766 --> 22:48.735
Anyway, Walter, I'm
only telling you this

22:48.768 --> 22:51.871
because I care deeply
about you.

22:51.904 --> 22:54.106
And I want to see
you and Paige make it.

22:56.976 --> 22:58.144
(drill whirring)

22:58.177 --> 23:00.780
Okay, hole's done.
TOBY (over radio): Yeah.

23:00.813 --> 23:02.014
We're making progress here, too.

23:02.048 --> 23:04.784
Yeah, a few more buckets of
sludge and we should be okay.

23:06.218 --> 23:07.654
I'm almost done with the ropes.

23:07.687 --> 23:09.522
I've attached tire irons
on the ends so you can

23:09.556 --> 23:11.023
stand on them
when I pull you up.

23:11.057 --> 23:12.825
Pretty smart, huh?

23:12.859 --> 23:13.626
HAPPY:
Yeah.

23:13.660 --> 23:16.863
Really good. Needy much?
(chuckles)

23:16.896 --> 23:18.164
You feeling better?

23:18.197 --> 23:20.900
I'm still upset.
But not about Megan.

23:20.933 --> 23:24.070
I'm concerned about
Fruity Moons.

23:24.103 --> 23:26.773
The cereal?
The marshmallow bits?

23:26.806 --> 23:31.077
Stars, suns, even little
Jupiters and Plutos.

23:31.110 --> 23:33.212
But they don't have
any moons.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.682
It's false advertising.

23:39.085 --> 23:41.954
Yeah, that is a good point.

23:41.988 --> 23:43.656
You know what?

23:43.690 --> 23:49.462
The box had Jupiter
and Pluto...

23:49.496 --> 23:51.564
but does it have Uranus?

23:52.632 --> 23:53.966
Get it?

23:54.000 --> 23:56.503
Sweetums, ribald humor is not
exactly your milieu.

23:56.536 --> 23:59.138
TOBY: What's going on? I told
my second joke of the day.

24:02.241 --> 24:04.577
I told my second joke
of the day.

24:04.611 --> 24:07.013
Paige?
Okay, get us up.

24:07.046 --> 24:09.549
Okay, the aftershock must have
opened the fissures wider.

24:09.582 --> 24:10.883
More gas is escaping.

24:10.917 --> 24:12.619
We're suffering from
methane poisoning.

24:12.652 --> 24:14.887
(gasps)
Sly, keep your head on,

24:14.921 --> 24:17.690
and don't let the gas
get you daffy.

24:17.724 --> 24:19.626
In 90 seconds, their
bloodstreams will be saturated

24:19.659 --> 24:21.661
and they'll die.
Walter!

24:22.995 --> 24:25.131
(yells) Toby! Toby!

24:28.801 --> 24:30.937
(faint, echoing):
Toby! Toby!

24:30.970 --> 24:33.540
Toby? Toby!

24:33.573 --> 24:35.575
It's too dark.
He can't find the hole.

24:35.608 --> 24:39.546
Toby! Toby!

24:39.579 --> 24:41.748
He's gone.

24:41.781 --> 24:42.782
W-What do you mean he's gone?

24:42.815 --> 24:44.250
I accidentally
knocked him in,

24:44.283 --> 24:45.685
and the current
pulled him under.

24:45.718 --> 24:47.520
Oh, Collins, you son of a bitch!

24:48.988 --> 24:50.690
WALTER:
Toby!

24:50.723 --> 24:51.891
Toby!

24:57.263 --> 24:58.364
COLLINS: There he is.
Busting up the ice.

24:58.397 --> 25:01.668
Wait, wait. Where? The current
has him moving all over.

25:01.701 --> 25:03.169
Look, if we know where he's
gonna be in a couple seconds,

25:03.202 --> 25:04.070
then we put a hole there.

25:04.103 --> 25:06.105
How much does the
psychiatrist weigh?

25:06.138 --> 25:07.807
He boxed at 168 pounds.

25:07.840 --> 25:11.243
And he moved ten feet
in 2.5 seconds...

25:11.277 --> 25:14.013
And in a parabolic arc
of 8.12...

25:14.046 --> 25:15.848
Which means that in 30 seconds,
he'll be...

25:15.882 --> 25:17.016
BOTH:
There.

25:19.952 --> 25:21.921
Here?

25:26.292 --> 25:28.194
HAPPY: Better fish him out,
O'Brien, damn it!

25:28.227 --> 25:29.596
Everyone, we have a plan.

25:29.629 --> 25:31.297
Paige, what's the ETA

25:31.330 --> 25:33.265
on getting the hysterical bride
out of the hole?

25:33.299 --> 25:35.267
You worry about
your catastrophe,

25:35.301 --> 25:36.736
I'll worry about mine.

25:36.769 --> 25:38.237
There!
He's right on course.

25:38.270 --> 25:39.238
Five seconds.

25:39.271 --> 25:41.908
Put your back into it, Agent!
(Cabe grunts)

25:41.941 --> 25:43.976
He's coming now.
Move it, Cabe!

25:44.010 --> 25:46.045
Where are you going?
Hold my feet.

25:54.854 --> 25:56.155
He's got Toby. Pull.

26:06.833 --> 26:09.636
(all grunting)

26:09.669 --> 26:11.604
(panting)

26:14.306 --> 26:16.609
You pulled me out?

26:16.643 --> 26:20.179
Only a lunatic was
gonna jump in that water.

26:20.212 --> 26:22.348
I was the natural choice.

26:25.952 --> 26:28.254
PAIGE: You'll be topside
in 15 seconds.

26:31.958 --> 26:34.026
(gasps)
I'm falling, I'm falling!

26:34.060 --> 26:35.227
Oh, oh.

26:35.261 --> 26:36.028
Guys, I'm sliding.

26:36.996 --> 26:39.799
No, no. No, no, no.

26:39.832 --> 26:41.701
What's going on up there?
PAIGE: I don't know.

26:41.734 --> 26:42.835
I'm getting no traction.

26:44.136 --> 26:46.105
Okay, the aftershock
must have softened the ice.

26:46.138 --> 26:48.074
Okay, give it
short bursts of gas.

26:48.107 --> 26:50.677
Don't floor it.

26:50.710 --> 26:52.879
(engine revving)

26:54.380 --> 26:55.347
Elevator up.

26:55.381 --> 26:57.016
(gasps)

26:57.049 --> 26:58.951
PAIGE:
You guys okay?

26:58.985 --> 27:00.920
Wait. Uh, wait,
hold on, hold on.

27:00.953 --> 27:02.955
I-I lost my-my wedding ring.

27:02.989 --> 27:04.090
It must have come off when

27:04.123 --> 27:05.224
I was clawing
up against this ice.

27:05.257 --> 27:06.292
Paige, do not stop.

27:07.326 --> 27:10.029
Sly, it is a Band-Aid.
I will get you another.

27:10.062 --> 27:12.965
It had remnants of
my original wedding band.

27:12.999 --> 27:14.166
It's sacred.

27:16.035 --> 27:17.904
HAPPY:
Paige, keep going.

27:29.248 --> 27:31.250
What if you lower me down
for just a second?

27:31.283 --> 27:32.418
I know I can find it.

27:32.451 --> 27:34.086
That cave is full of poison gas.

27:34.120 --> 27:35.922
I don't care.
I need that ring!

27:40.059 --> 27:42.161
What the heck?
Happy?!

27:43.362 --> 27:45.798
Happy!
Happy!

27:45.832 --> 27:46.766
(grunts)

27:47.834 --> 27:49.168
Happy.

27:49.201 --> 27:51.070
(groans)

27:55.975 --> 27:57.944
I slipped off.

27:57.977 --> 28:01.680
Sorry, Pal, not going back in.

28:08.988 --> 28:10.289
Change into those ASAP.

28:10.322 --> 28:11.858
Hate to rush you,
but we still got to

28:11.891 --> 28:13.092
get the bacteria to the crevice.

28:13.125 --> 28:14.761
(door closes)

28:16.395 --> 28:18.330
Let's move that wet jacket.

28:23.936 --> 28:27.139
I, um...

28:27.173 --> 28:28.507
guess I owe you a thanks.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.910
It's the least
I could do.

28:30.943 --> 28:32.144
No, no, the least
you could have done

28:32.178 --> 28:34.446
was let me drown
in the Barents Sea.

28:34.480 --> 28:37.750
That's exactly the behavior
of the old Collins,

28:37.784 --> 28:39.852
not the man you see
in front of you now.

28:39.886 --> 28:42.188
You were telling
the truth.

28:42.221 --> 28:44.456
Or you're a sociopath
who knows how to

28:44.490 --> 28:46.025
circumvent my
brilliant eye.

28:47.359 --> 28:49.328
The bacteria's loaded.

28:49.361 --> 28:51.197
Buckle up.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.464
(engine starts)

28:52.498 --> 28:54.801
(hands rubbing together)

28:58.570 --> 29:00.139
HAPPY: Okay, we are married
for ten minutes,

29:00.172 --> 29:01.941
and you're already
being dumb.

29:01.974 --> 29:04.944
I didn't actually want
to go in the water.

29:04.977 --> 29:06.979
Oh, I love you, too.

29:07.013 --> 29:07.914
(door opens)

29:07.947 --> 29:09.916
(Collins groans)

29:09.949 --> 29:11.984
Whoa, whoa.
Am I about to be struck?

29:12.018 --> 29:14.353
Quick reminder, he's the one
who actually saved me.

29:14.386 --> 29:16.388
He is also the one
who put you in danger.

29:16.422 --> 29:17.824
Accidentally.

29:17.857 --> 29:19.826
Sweetums, you're breaking
the "A" of PANNS.

29:19.859 --> 29:22.895
"Always strive to be in
a positive state of mind."

29:22.929 --> 29:25.832
Come on, don't let Collins
challenge our marital creed.

29:27.433 --> 29:28.935
It was an accident, kiddo.
I was there.

29:28.968 --> 29:32.839
(whispers): I'm not buying
this "new you" bit.

29:34.540 --> 29:38.310
God, she is terrifying.

29:38.344 --> 29:39.478
We're constructing
gas masks out of

29:39.511 --> 29:41.513
the air filtration system
from the vehicle

29:41.547 --> 29:43.482
so you and Cabe can descend
down to the crevasse

29:43.515 --> 29:45.351
and inject the bacteria
into the methane bubble

29:45.384 --> 29:46.385
and neutralize it.

29:46.418 --> 29:48.154
Make those masks sturdy.

29:48.187 --> 29:50.389
We can't be saving the world
from a bug takeover

29:50.422 --> 29:51.891
debating Fruity Moons.

29:51.924 --> 29:53.092
Okay, I'll start
working on mine.

29:53.125 --> 29:54.193
Cabe, can you
pop the hood?

29:54.226 --> 29:55.227
And, Happy, Sly,

29:55.261 --> 29:56.963
finish on Cabe's.

30:05.304 --> 30:06.405
Can you hold this?

30:10.042 --> 30:13.913
Hmm, you seem...
thoughtful.

30:13.946 --> 30:15.214
Your "hysterical bride" comment,

30:15.247 --> 30:16.916
insinuating that I was
not doing my job

30:16.949 --> 30:19.952
by failing to keep Happy's
genius psyche in balance?

30:19.986 --> 30:25.191
Uh, you're upset because I
critiqued your job performance?

30:25.224 --> 30:27.894
Are you asking as my boyfriend
or as a team member?

30:27.927 --> 30:29.095
Team member.

30:29.128 --> 30:32.899
Um, this boyfriend/girlfriend
thing, i-it's a blurred line,

30:32.932 --> 30:34.066
to say the least.

30:34.100 --> 30:35.467
I-I just...
I never anticipated

30:35.501 --> 30:37.636
these types of problems
would continue

30:37.669 --> 30:39.872
after we got together.

30:39.906 --> 30:42.274
I just think that
we should...

30:42.308 --> 30:44.476
be aware of
potential pitfalls,

30:44.510 --> 30:46.979
just so that we can
continue to, you know,

30:47.013 --> 30:50.016
be... together.

30:50.049 --> 30:54.153
That is very EQ
of you, Walter,

30:54.186 --> 30:57.123
and I agree.

30:57.156 --> 30:58.324
Okay.

30:58.357 --> 31:00.359
Okay.
HAPPY: O'Brien.

31:00.392 --> 31:02.294
Quit your yacking
and get those filters ready.

31:05.264 --> 31:07.266
What are you looking at?

31:07.299 --> 31:08.935
Just an incredible woman.

31:10.536 --> 31:14.073
I just wanted
to congratulate you.

31:14.106 --> 31:16.208
Walter O'Brien
three years ago

31:16.242 --> 31:18.477
versus Walter O'Brien now?

31:18.510 --> 31:19.946
It's like night and day.

31:19.979 --> 31:22.448
Not that you don't still
have a long way to go,

31:22.481 --> 31:24.917
but still, kudos.

31:24.951 --> 31:27.219
Are you done, Mark?
No.

31:27.253 --> 31:28.420
But I'll conclude.

31:28.454 --> 31:31.090
Speaking as one of
his oldest friends,

31:31.123 --> 31:34.160
Walter is like
the fermented fish

31:34.193 --> 31:35.661
that he eats
so obsessively.

31:35.694 --> 31:37.930
He's a... acquired taste

31:37.964 --> 31:39.498
that most people
never fully acquire,

31:39.531 --> 31:40.499
unless you're
a harp seal, which...

31:40.532 --> 31:42.234
(laughs)

31:42.268 --> 31:45.938
Anyway, you can discuss

31:45.972 --> 31:50.376
the emotional divisions
ad nauseam.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.511
Are you a team member,

31:52.544 --> 31:55.181
or are you his girlfriend?
You were listening?

31:55.214 --> 31:56.515
Well, it's a small tundra.

31:56.548 --> 32:00.152
My point is, at the
end of the day,

32:00.186 --> 32:02.254
there is no end of the day.

32:02.288 --> 32:04.023
Whereas you used
to be able to escape

32:04.056 --> 32:07.393
the constantly cerebral with
the occasional baseball player

32:07.426 --> 32:12.231
or Navy SEAL,
now it's just...

32:12.264 --> 32:15.667
fermented fish
with every meal...

32:15.701 --> 32:17.169
forever.

32:19.171 --> 32:20.372
I'm sorry.

32:20.406 --> 32:22.141
Am I being negative?

32:22.174 --> 32:24.310
'Cause I-I don't
mean to be negative.

32:24.343 --> 32:26.478
It's just that, well,

32:26.512 --> 32:30.249
I see you guys and
I'm worried about you.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.318
(rumbling)

32:33.652 --> 32:36.188
Aftershock. Brace yourselves!

32:37.223 --> 32:39.025
The gas generator.

32:39.058 --> 32:40.492
If it falls
into the crevasse

32:40.526 --> 32:42.328
and ruptures near one of
the methane leaks, it could...

32:43.395 --> 32:44.997
Duck!

32:48.134 --> 32:49.668
Oh, this is bad.

32:51.670 --> 32:54.173
Aah!

32:56.208 --> 32:57.309
It could've been worse.

32:57.343 --> 32:58.644
Almost lost a gooty.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.056
HAPPY:
Aah, this is very bad.

33:10.089 --> 33:11.723
Every single gust of wind
pushes the fire

33:11.757 --> 33:12.924
back down
into the methane pocket.

33:12.958 --> 33:15.627
It'll produce an explosion
equivalent to an atomic bomb.

33:15.661 --> 33:18.397
That's us dead, along with half
of Northern Norway.

33:18.430 --> 33:21.067
Not gonna happen.
Walter?

33:21.100 --> 33:22.434
Fire.

33:22.468 --> 33:23.469
We need fire.

33:23.502 --> 33:24.303
I think we have
too much of that.

33:24.336 --> 33:25.771
WALTER:
No, we need to harness it

33:25.804 --> 33:27.573
so we can direct it
to where we want,

33:27.606 --> 33:29.175
like the interior ice wall
of the crevasse.

33:29.208 --> 33:30.609
Melt the wall.

33:30.642 --> 33:33.179
Water flows down into the hole,
dowses the flame.

33:33.212 --> 33:35.181
Killing the flame is great, but
if you blow out an oven burner,

33:35.214 --> 33:37.049
it doesn't mean gas
isn't still escaping.

33:37.083 --> 33:38.784
We're gonna avoid
imminent explosion,

33:38.817 --> 33:40.286
but there's still
gonna be methane

33:40.319 --> 33:41.520
pouring into the atmosphere.

33:41.553 --> 33:42.588
We'll tackle that when
we're not in danger

33:42.621 --> 33:43.622
of being disintegrated.

33:44.756 --> 33:46.325
Oh, oh, oh!

33:46.358 --> 33:48.394
The Arctic vehicle.
It's military surplus.

33:48.427 --> 33:50.696
It has an armored
undercarriage.

33:50.729 --> 33:52.331
Pitch the Arctic truck
into the crevasse,

33:52.364 --> 33:54.800
so it sits over the flame,
redirects it around the sides,

33:54.833 --> 33:56.268
right into the crevasse wall.

33:56.302 --> 33:57.736
Leaving one little issue.

33:57.769 --> 33:59.338
Someone's got to go the driving.

33:59.371 --> 34:00.439
At exactly the right
speed and angle

34:00.472 --> 34:02.474
to pitch the truck into
the crevasse so it sticks.

34:02.508 --> 34:03.642
SYLVESTER:
Miss by a hair

34:03.675 --> 34:05.477
and it topples into the flames.

34:05.511 --> 34:06.678
I'm on the numbers.

34:06.712 --> 34:08.414
This sounds like
a suicide mission.

34:08.447 --> 34:10.816
Not if Cabe rolls out
the driver side door

34:10.849 --> 34:13.085
just before the crevasse.
Thanks for the nomination.

34:13.119 --> 34:14.353
Believe in you, man.

34:14.386 --> 34:16.122
No, the doc's right.

34:16.155 --> 34:18.690
I know how to ditch a car
at 30 miles an hour.

34:18.724 --> 34:22.094
Uh, you're gonna have to go 45.

34:22.128 --> 34:24.596
Okay, guys,
let's get to work.

34:26.865 --> 34:28.700
(grunts)

34:28.734 --> 34:30.169
Careful.

34:30.202 --> 34:31.470
Yeah, I got it.

34:36.708 --> 34:39.111
Okay, we got it.
20% pitch

34:39.145 --> 34:41.280
at 45 miles an hour,
which means you need

34:41.313 --> 34:42.581
to get up to 46
when you ditch out

34:42.614 --> 34:44.616
and the ditch-out spot
needs to be precise.

34:44.650 --> 34:46.752
All right, so mark the ice.
Place a stake in it.

34:46.785 --> 34:48.587
Too big a window
as to when you're gonna hit

34:48.620 --> 34:50.589
45 miles an hour
because of the icy terrain.

34:50.622 --> 34:52.258
The exact moment of ditch

34:52.291 --> 34:54.893
is going to have to be
calculated on the fly.

34:54.926 --> 34:56.395
So, somebody that
knows the numbers

34:56.428 --> 34:57.763
is gonna have to ride with me.

35:02.701 --> 35:04.270
I know the numbers.

35:04.303 --> 35:06.738
Also, if Cabe drives off,

35:06.772 --> 35:08.174
you're gonna be
writhing on the ground

35:08.207 --> 35:09.608
with more juice in you
than Con Ed.

35:09.641 --> 35:12.444
That also factored
into my decision.

35:12.478 --> 35:14.580
Settled.

35:18.184 --> 35:20.486
Collins is shotgun.

35:20.519 --> 35:22.888
(door opens)

35:30.596 --> 35:31.597
WALTER:
The numbers should work.

35:31.630 --> 35:33.599
We accounted for the many
potential variables.

35:33.632 --> 35:36.668
Solid odds for a
successful outcome.

35:36.702 --> 35:38.170
You can do this.

35:38.204 --> 35:39.338
Get out of there
safely, okay?

35:39.371 --> 35:41.607
All right. Thank you.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.575
Watch the wheel
pulling left, old man.

35:43.609 --> 35:45.511
CABE:
Oh, right. Thanks.

35:45.544 --> 35:48.347
Cabe, I know you can do this.
All right, buddy.

35:48.380 --> 35:50.549
You guys do know that
I'm going with him, right?

35:50.582 --> 35:52.584
Yup.

35:54.886 --> 35:57.489
(engine starts)

35:59.225 --> 36:00.492
Hold on to your beard!

36:04.630 --> 36:05.797
COLLINS:
Hey.

36:05.831 --> 36:07.466
Angle it three degrees

36:07.499 --> 36:08.967
to your left.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.702
Almost there.

36:10.736 --> 36:11.903
Hold your position.

36:11.937 --> 36:14.573
I hit 46 miles an hour!

36:14.606 --> 36:17.643
We ditch in
three, two, one!

36:17.676 --> 36:19.311
Go!

36:19.345 --> 36:20.346
My cuff is caught!

36:20.379 --> 36:21.780
No! Wait!

36:25.651 --> 36:26.852
Collins isn't jumping.

36:28.487 --> 36:29.821
Jump, you lunatic!

36:32.658 --> 36:33.959
(van crashes)

36:35.627 --> 36:37.429
(electrical buzzing)

36:40.699 --> 36:42.200
(buzzing continues)

36:53.779 --> 36:56.448
I can't believe I'm saying this.

36:56.482 --> 36:58.917
We have to save Mark Collins.

37:09.728 --> 37:12.431
Less than 30 seconds before
Collins is cooked alive.

37:12.464 --> 37:13.565
All those volts
going through him,

37:13.599 --> 37:14.566
he can't even attempt
to climb out!

37:14.600 --> 37:17.403
Grab the grappling rope
and throw it down to me.

37:17.436 --> 37:19.004
Down? Where are you going?

37:22.874 --> 37:25.677
(grunts)

37:32.618 --> 37:34.720
Come on! Move out!
Let's go!

37:34.753 --> 37:37.423
Hurry!
The crevasse wall is melting!

37:37.456 --> 37:38.657
(rumbling)

37:38.690 --> 37:39.958
That truck is gonna fall.

37:39.991 --> 37:41.927
(metal groaning)
Get your foot in there.

37:41.960 --> 37:44.496
Okay.
Pull!

37:48.434 --> 37:49.835
(shouts)

37:49.868 --> 37:51.870
(crashing)

37:57.976 --> 38:00.579
(grunting)

38:02.348 --> 38:04.350
(grunts)

38:04.383 --> 38:07.353
(pants)

38:07.386 --> 38:09.888
You still amped to be
a part of the team?

38:11.923 --> 38:14.460
(laughs)

38:21.400 --> 38:23.469
Keeping an eye on that guy.

38:23.502 --> 38:24.903
He's a bore worm.

38:24.936 --> 38:27.072
He burrowed into
us, into PANNS.

38:27.105 --> 38:29.107
Now I think he's messing
with Walt and Paige.

38:29.140 --> 38:31.042
We should've known
he'd play games.

38:31.076 --> 38:32.511
We should've protected PANNS.

38:32.544 --> 38:33.712
I know, right?

38:33.745 --> 38:35.481
That is the new wave
of marital stability.

38:35.514 --> 38:37.383
It's an unbreakable
contract and bond.

38:37.416 --> 38:39.785
Well, the ketubah's been
around for a thousand years.

38:39.818 --> 38:42.421
Happy, that's a PANNS
violation right there.

38:44.690 --> 38:45.857
CABE:
Thank you, sir.

38:45.891 --> 38:48.427
That was Director Carson.

38:48.460 --> 38:50.095
I downloaded him on
our current situation.

38:50.128 --> 38:51.463
A new drill

38:51.497 --> 38:52.564
is coming in

38:52.598 --> 38:53.865
from the Gulf of Mexico
in 36 hours.

38:53.899 --> 38:55.133
That would suffice.

38:55.166 --> 38:56.802
The collapse of the crevasse

38:56.835 --> 38:58.570
significantly slowed down
the methane release.

38:58.604 --> 39:00.906
It's probably a week till
we're back in the red zone

39:00.939 --> 39:03.475
and we should have all the
necessary chemicals and bacteria

39:03.509 --> 39:04.876
pumped in well before then.

39:04.910 --> 39:06.478
There's no "we." Them.

39:06.512 --> 39:09.915
Carson has a military
transport waiting at Thule.

39:09.948 --> 39:12.851
He wants wheels up within the
hour with you and me on it.

39:12.884 --> 39:14.686
I'm taking you back to lockup.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.422
Team's gonna stick around
for the next day or so

39:16.455 --> 39:17.623
and wrap things up without us.

39:17.656 --> 39:19.825
Course.

39:19.858 --> 39:22.828
You may be a crazy man...

39:22.861 --> 39:25.597
but what I saw today
showed a lot of guts.

39:25.631 --> 39:27.132
Hey.

39:27.165 --> 39:29.435
Don't go too far.

39:29.468 --> 39:31.770
Been lit up like
Liberace's Christmas tree

39:31.803 --> 39:33.439
one too many times today.

39:33.472 --> 39:35.641
(chuckles)

39:35.674 --> 39:37.643
Well...

39:37.676 --> 39:40.912
it appears I'll be going back
to my federal accommodations.

39:42.614 --> 39:44.983
You guys might not believe
that I've changed.

39:45.016 --> 39:46.985
Y-You don't have to.

39:47.018 --> 39:49.821
But what is important
is that you know

39:49.855 --> 39:51.523
that I care very deeply
about you two.

39:51.557 --> 39:53.024
And it was in that spirit

39:53.058 --> 39:55.160
that I shared the observations
that I did

39:55.193 --> 39:56.528
about your relationship.

39:56.562 --> 39:59.598
I may have overstepped,

39:59.631 --> 40:02.501
but I don't want you to feel
like I was pouring cold water

40:02.534 --> 40:05.504
on a beautiful, new flame.

40:07.906 --> 40:09.475
You couldn't if you tried.

40:09.508 --> 40:11.877
COLLINS:
That's the spirit.

40:11.910 --> 40:14.746
But if there is
any ill feeling...

40:14.780 --> 40:17.082
I apologize.

40:17.115 --> 40:19.050
I'm not used to trying

40:19.084 --> 40:22.654
to be... human.

40:24.656 --> 40:26.224
Mark.

40:26.257 --> 40:29.060
Walter.

40:29.094 --> 40:30.696
Miss Paige.

40:35.534 --> 40:38.537
So, he talked to you, too, huh?

40:38.570 --> 40:39.805
WALTER:
He did.

40:39.838 --> 40:42.508
But he predicted
an extinction event for Earth

40:42.541 --> 40:43.675
and we stopped it, so...

40:43.709 --> 40:45.911
perhaps we can

40:45.944 --> 40:50.582
stop our own extinction event.

40:50.616 --> 40:53.785
Perhaps.

40:53.819 --> 40:58.056
Perhaps we're
too inherently different.

41:00.025 --> 41:01.026
I'm not saying he's right.

41:01.059 --> 41:03.128
I'm just, I'm saying...

41:03.161 --> 41:05.497
he is one of the six
smartest people alive.

41:05.531 --> 41:07.132
He could have a point.

41:09.134 --> 41:12.070
Or maybe he's just...

41:12.103 --> 41:14.540
being a jerk and messing with...
I don't know.

41:14.573 --> 41:17.809
Well, I'm one of the five
smartest people in the world

41:17.843 --> 41:19.110
and I do know.

41:19.144 --> 41:21.246
Not to repeat myself,
but if we can stop

41:21.279 --> 41:24.950
tons of methane
in its tracks, then...

41:24.983 --> 41:27.986
we can make this work.

41:31.590 --> 41:32.824
You really feel that way?

41:32.858 --> 41:34.860
Oh, the truth is, I feel like...

41:37.729 --> 41:39.731
♪ I feel like sun is shining

41:39.765 --> 41:42.568
♪ And the birds are singing.

41:44.002 --> 41:45.971
Sly, come on.
Sing about being squeamish

41:46.004 --> 41:48.874
and cleanliness.
Uh, no.

41:50.909 --> 41:52.143
Walter.

41:53.745 --> 41:56.815
He's jumping for joy.
What a dope.

41:57.783 --> 42:00.586
You have such
beautiful eyes.

42:00.619 --> 42:01.853
What's wrong with you two?

42:01.887 --> 42:04.022
I'm feeling light-headed.

42:04.055 --> 42:05.123
Oh, man.

42:05.156 --> 42:07.292
Okay, shake off
the cobwebs, guys.

42:08.627 --> 42:09.861
Uh...

42:13.932 --> 42:16.267
Methane geysers,
hundreds of them.

42:16.301 --> 42:18.136
Must've opened
in the last aftershock.

42:18.169 --> 42:20.038
Guess we didn't stop the methane
in its tracks.

42:20.071 --> 42:21.773
We don't have a week
to plug up these holes.

42:21.807 --> 42:23.709
This will start warming
the Earth's atmosphere

42:23.742 --> 42:24.843
within hours and then...

42:24.876 --> 42:26.778
Mass extinction.

42:30.949 --> 42:32.651
♪ Not good.
