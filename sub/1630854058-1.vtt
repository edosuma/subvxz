WEBVTT

00:27.000 --> 00:29.495
- I believe in America.

00:29.597 --> 00:33.369
I believe in the
people of America.

00:33.471 --> 00:37.744
Although this election
didn't go our way,

00:37.846 --> 00:39.947
I believe we made a difference.

00:40.049 --> 00:42.845
And you can be sure
we'll continue to fight.

00:47.222 --> 00:49.283
Maggie and I would like
to thank every one of you

00:49.385 --> 00:51.889
who helped us get this far.

00:51.991 --> 00:54.495
This was never about me.

00:54.597 --> 00:56.992
This is about us.

00:57.094 --> 01:00.095
This is about you.

01:00.197 --> 01:01.531
This is about the future.

01:39.368 --> 01:40.535
Jesus Christ, Roger.

01:40.637 --> 01:42.537
He didn't lose because
he used profanity.

01:42.640 --> 01:46.106
He lost because he was
outspent three-to-one.

01:46.208 --> 01:47.410
I don't care.

01:47.512 --> 01:48.977
You're not sitting in
the front, are you?

01:49.079 --> 01:50.609
Yeah, why not?

01:50.711 --> 01:52.751
Have a good
trip, Mrs. Lambert.

01:52.853 --> 01:53.751
- No, I know.

01:53.853 --> 01:54.654
I understand.

01:54.756 --> 01:55.684
Ellen, thank you.

01:59.156 --> 02:00.390
Where you headed?

02:00.493 --> 02:02.224
This old family lake
house down in Georgia.

02:02.326 --> 02:05.194
Haven't been back in 20 years.

02:05.296 --> 02:07.533
It should be pretty romantic.

02:07.635 --> 02:08.294
Great.

02:08.396 --> 02:09.696
So the airport then?

02:09.799 --> 02:12.501
Yeah, unless you want
to drive us to Georgia.

02:12.603 --> 02:14.639
I wasn't going to
drive you to Georgia.

02:14.741 --> 02:15.541
Right.

02:15.644 --> 02:16.838
Oh, Yeah.

02:16.940 --> 02:17.808
Yep.

02:17.910 --> 02:18.839
Airport's fine.

02:29.021 --> 02:30.821
Honey, seriously.

02:30.923 --> 02:32.125
Media blackout.

02:32.227 --> 02:33.660
Well, now the child's
parents are claiming

02:33.762 --> 02:36.088
he has hearing loss.

02:36.190 --> 02:37.294
Hi.

02:37.396 --> 02:38.659
We have a reservation
under Lambert.

02:38.761 --> 02:40.996
Are you self-driving
or fully automated?

02:41.098 --> 02:43.269
Self-driving.

02:43.371 --> 02:45.032
Look, I don't want to hear
anything more about it.

02:45.134 --> 02:46.504
Really.

02:46.606 --> 02:47.738
That's why we came down south.
Nobody knows me here--

02:47.840 --> 02:48.674
Hey!

02:48.776 --> 02:50.170
Jack Lambert!

02:50.272 --> 02:51.377
Fuck, yeah!

02:54.282 --> 02:56.308
You know, we could
still go to Hawaii.

02:56.410 --> 02:57.916
Don't do that.

02:58.018 --> 02:59.748
You're going to love this.

02:59.850 --> 03:02.851
Small town, middle and
nowhere, nobody to bother us.

03:02.953 --> 03:07.761
Well, if the house sells
fast, we could do a short trip.

03:07.863 --> 03:10.294
Romantic weekend in Maui.

03:10.396 --> 03:12.527
This is going to
be plenty romantic!

03:12.629 --> 03:16.231
The woods, the lake,
the starry sky.

03:16.333 --> 03:18.000
Doesn't sound so bad.

03:18.102 --> 03:20.236
You'll see.

03:20.338 --> 03:22.908
Air's just different down here.

03:23.010 --> 03:24.339
It's humid, for sure.

03:24.441 --> 03:28.113
But it's just so full of life.

03:28.215 --> 03:29.212
And once we get
to the lake house,

03:29.314 --> 03:30.779
everything just fades away.

04:09.417 --> 04:11.990
It's rustic.

04:12.092 --> 04:13.426
It hasn't changed at all.

04:16.192 --> 04:19.061
Come on.

04:33.843 --> 04:36.016
Has anyone been taking
care of this place?

04:36.118 --> 04:38.615
For about a year
since dad died.

04:38.717 --> 04:40.987
Are you sure your friend
can handle the work?

04:41.089 --> 04:42.521
Oh yeah, Patrice is a pro.

04:52.330 --> 04:54.164
- Pretty retro.

04:54.266 --> 04:55.829
- It is so weird.

04:55.932 --> 04:58.066
I haven't been back here
since I was a teenager.

04:58.168 --> 04:59.037
Please.

04:59.139 --> 05:02.076
You were never a teenager.

05:02.178 --> 05:03.308
I'm going to go
check out the view.

05:03.410 --> 05:05.005
Yeah, you should.
It's pretty amazing.

05:54.957 --> 05:56.756
Not sure about your
dad's taste in decor,

05:56.858 --> 05:59.060
but you were right
about the view.

05:59.162 --> 06:00.426
Oh.

06:00.528 --> 06:01.829
What's this?

06:01.931 --> 06:05.269
That
is proof that, uh,

06:05.371 --> 06:07.271
I actually was a teenager once.

06:07.373 --> 06:10.343
Wow, look at that goofy smile.

06:10.446 --> 06:13.175
Yeah, that was before
all the media training.

06:13.277 --> 06:14.441
Who's the girl?

06:14.543 --> 06:16.717
That's, uh, Elise.

06:16.819 --> 06:19.348
She's cute.

06:19.450 --> 06:21.052
Local girl who got away.

06:21.154 --> 06:22.951
Yeah.

06:28.895 --> 06:29.788
Wow.

06:29.890 --> 06:33.166
Dad really let this place go.

06:33.268 --> 06:35.031
Well, I guess we
won't be running.

06:35.133 --> 06:36.896
What?

06:36.998 --> 06:39.071
You can clean this
up with a machete.

06:39.173 --> 06:40.100
It'll be good for you.

06:43.477 --> 06:46.177
Yeah, I'll have
Patrice look at it.

06:46.279 --> 06:47.781
Are you sure it's safe?

06:47.883 --> 06:48.476
Of course.

06:48.578 --> 06:49.475
My dad built it himself.

06:49.577 --> 06:51.147
It's solid.

06:52.248 --> 06:53.954
Oh!

06:54.056 --> 06:55.084
- Are you OK?

06:55.186 --> 06:56.322
Yeah.

06:56.424 --> 06:57.816
Found a little spot
that needs to fix.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.656
I'll have Patrice look at it.

06:59.759 --> 07:01.428
- Are you sure you
know what you're doing?

07:01.530 --> 07:08.130
Yeah, you just, uh,
flip these switches here.

07:08.232 --> 07:09.762
Yay!

07:13.769 --> 07:14.801
I'll have Patrice look at it.

07:14.903 --> 07:16.070
You'll have
Patrice look at it.

07:27.449 --> 07:28.555
Nice.

07:34.797 --> 07:35.727
Voila.

07:39.528 --> 07:40.361
What's wrong?

07:40.463 --> 07:41.493
What is this?

07:41.596 --> 07:42.631
Ravioli.

07:42.733 --> 07:44.766
I know, it's not
part of your diet,

07:44.868 --> 07:46.532
but there's nothing
else in the house.

07:47.704 --> 07:49.706
Hey, I used to love this stuff.

07:49.808 --> 07:51.308
My dad used to make it
for me all the time.

07:51.410 --> 07:52.546
You're going to love it.

07:56.411 --> 07:57.850
Mm.

07:57.952 --> 07:59.082
Uh-uh.

07:59.185 --> 08:00.420
Oh my god.

08:00.523 --> 08:02.550
Either that's gone, or
my tastes have changed.

08:02.652 --> 08:03.819
- Oh no, honey.

08:03.921 --> 08:05.123
When something's good,
it's always good.

08:05.225 --> 08:06.153
That looks terrible.

08:16.365 --> 08:18.266
Hey.

08:18.369 --> 08:19.265
I'm sorry.

08:22.538 --> 08:23.676
I'm just tired.

08:26.844 --> 08:28.208
I wanted everything
to be perfect.

08:31.913 --> 08:35.250
That's why you're perfect.

08:35.353 --> 08:36.557
Come here.

08:51.768 --> 08:53.466
There is so much to choose from.

08:53.568 --> 08:54.737
Yeah.

08:54.839 --> 08:56.705
Just grab a cheddar
or something.

08:56.807 --> 08:58.139
I'm going to get
a bottle of wine.

09:46.389 --> 09:47.191
Oh!

09:47.293 --> 09:49.128
Damn it, sorry.

09:49.230 --> 09:50.325
I didn't see you.

09:50.427 --> 09:51.590
Elise?

09:51.692 --> 09:52.798
Yeah.

09:56.335 --> 09:57.264
- Jack?

10:13.387 --> 10:15.155
Found a decent Camembert.

10:15.257 --> 10:16.555
What's with you in cans?

10:16.657 --> 10:18.753
There's fresh
asparagus over there.

10:18.855 --> 10:22.624
Um, I-- I like it in the can.

10:22.726 --> 10:25.993
You like it in the can?

10:26.095 --> 10:27.998
Do you even hear
the things you say?

10:50.086 --> 10:52.256
And here's the
little reading nook.

10:52.358 --> 10:53.553
Say hi to Jack.

10:53.656 --> 10:54.489
Hi, Jack.

10:54.591 --> 10:55.826
Hey, Louise.

10:55.929 --> 10:57.594
Louise thinks with some
paint and a few repairs,

10:57.696 --> 10:58.865
she can unload this place fast.

10:58.967 --> 11:00.029
Oh.

11:00.131 --> 11:02.002
Well, hopefully to someone
who appreciates it.

11:02.965 --> 11:05.065
Oh, that's got to be Patrice.

11:05.167 --> 11:06.472
Can you take me
back to the kitchen?

11:06.574 --> 11:08.203
Uh, sure.
We have to be quick.

11:14.578 --> 11:17.183
Holy shit.

11:19.419 --> 11:20.814
You look great, man.

11:20.916 --> 11:23.156
Hey, you know, you know.

11:23.258 --> 11:24.419
Keeping it tight.

11:24.521 --> 11:25.457
Right.

11:25.559 --> 11:26.885
What are you wearing, khakis?

11:26.987 --> 11:28.288
Relaxed fit, baby.

11:28.390 --> 11:29.894
Hey, listen, I gotta talk
to you about something.

11:29.996 --> 11:33.660
Ooh, and this must be
her, your beautiful wife!

11:33.762 --> 11:34.562
Hello, Patrice.

11:34.664 --> 11:36.436
Oh, hello.

11:36.538 --> 11:38.497
It is so good to
finally meet you.

11:38.599 --> 11:40.536
Hey, I'm sorry I couldn't
make it out to the wedding.

11:40.638 --> 11:41.539
You know, I was--

11:41.641 --> 11:42.506
No, don't worry about that.

11:42.608 --> 11:44.075
That was so long ago.

11:44.177 --> 11:45.774
You know, I was just getting
my business up and running.

11:45.876 --> 11:46.907
Jack says you're doing well.

11:47.010 --> 11:47.974
Hey, you know,
I wouldn't trust

11:48.076 --> 11:49.445
anything a politician says.

11:49.547 --> 11:50.811
Yeah, hey, hey.

11:50.913 --> 11:52.279
But yeah, I'm doing good.

11:52.381 --> 11:55.652
Definitely excited to get
to work on this house.

11:55.754 --> 11:57.356
Lot of great memories here.

11:57.458 --> 11:58.619
It could use an update.

11:58.721 --> 11:59.751
Oh, no, no, no.

11:59.854 --> 12:01.190
I love it.

12:01.292 --> 12:04.062
How long has it been since
you've seen each other?

12:04.164 --> 12:04.789
Um.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.399
10 years?

12:06.501 --> 12:07.629
When I came up to New York.

12:07.731 --> 12:08.694
Yeah, that's right.

12:08.797 --> 12:11.069
10 years.

12:11.171 --> 12:14.405
Hey, listen, I'd offer you a
beer, but they're all warm.

12:14.507 --> 12:15.308
Hey, no worries.

12:15.410 --> 12:16.239
I'll just grab my gear.

12:16.341 --> 12:16.936
OK.

12:17.038 --> 12:18.210
I'll get us some wine.

12:18.312 --> 12:19.112
All right.

12:19.214 --> 12:20.140
Thanks, hon.

12:20.242 --> 12:22.610
Goddamn, you got
you a hot one, huh?

12:22.712 --> 12:23.580
Yeah, yeah.

12:23.682 --> 12:26.052
Hey, listen-- I saw Elise.

12:26.154 --> 12:28.421
Shit.

12:28.523 --> 12:29.787
- So I'm not going crazy?

12:29.889 --> 12:31.823
She only been
back a little while.

12:31.925 --> 12:34.893
Cause that bullshit
company hired her daddy.

12:34.995 --> 12:38.760
I mean, they fly out there
10 years to the colony,

12:38.862 --> 12:40.699
and nothing's ready to go?

12:40.801 --> 12:42.402
I mean, most of
them colonists they

12:42.504 --> 12:44.134
shipped off to another project.

12:44.236 --> 12:48.066
But couldn't unload everybody,
so sent their asses back

12:48.168 --> 12:50.375
another 10 years in space.

12:50.477 --> 12:52.045
That's horrible.

12:52.147 --> 12:53.241
Sure.

12:53.343 --> 12:54.714
But you know, they're
getting their settlement.

12:54.816 --> 12:57.483
Hell, I
wouldn't mind getting

12:57.585 --> 13:00.618
paid for 20 years of sleeping.

13:00.720 --> 13:02.418
She hasn't changed at all.

13:02.521 --> 13:03.623
No, man.

13:03.725 --> 13:06.225
You know how that
whole thing works.

13:06.327 --> 13:07.391
Speed of light.

13:07.493 --> 13:08.659
Hibernation.

13:08.761 --> 13:10.224
Nobody ages on that damn trip.

13:10.326 --> 13:12.028
I know, my dad helped
develop the program.

13:12.131 --> 13:13.366
That's why they're not
supposed to come back.

13:13.468 --> 13:14.761
It's weird.
- Oh.

13:14.863 --> 13:16.001
Here we go!

13:18.705 --> 13:19.603
Can I get you anything else?

13:19.705 --> 13:21.769
Thank you, thank you.

13:21.871 --> 13:23.339
What do you think?

13:23.441 --> 13:25.541
Do you think we can get this
place fixed up in a week or so?

13:25.643 --> 13:27.577
Uh, yeah, yeah.

13:27.679 --> 13:28.811
Bring a few guys on.

13:28.913 --> 13:30.915
We'll paint, fix what's broken.

13:31.017 --> 13:32.849
Yeah, but you don't
want to do too much

13:32.951 --> 13:34.814
and kill the charm
of this place.

13:34.916 --> 13:36.055
Nothing too new.

13:36.157 --> 13:36.750
Oh.

13:38.588 --> 13:39.390
Oh!

13:39.492 --> 13:40.325
There you go.

13:40.427 --> 13:41.490
Yeah, man.

13:41.593 --> 13:42.795
Perfect.

13:42.897 --> 13:44.260
Do you mind taking a
look at the dock, too?

13:44.362 --> 13:45.995
Maggie, we just wanted to
catch you up for a minute.

13:46.097 --> 13:47.598
Oh, no, no, no.
No, it's no big deal.

13:47.700 --> 13:49.128
Let's go.
- Thank you.

13:49.230 --> 13:50.400
I'll get a cheese plate going.

13:50.502 --> 13:51.399
Mm-hmm.

13:54.576 --> 13:55.537
"I'll get a cheese plate going."

13:55.640 --> 13:57.443
Shut up.

13:57.545 --> 13:58.772
She's been a good partner.

14:00.010 --> 14:01.711
- Always a romantic.

14:01.813 --> 14:02.676
Hey, where's she living?

14:02.778 --> 14:03.743
Who?

14:03.846 --> 14:05.282
Oh, Elise?

14:05.384 --> 14:06.946
Yeah, well, she's staying out
of her grandmother's house

14:07.048 --> 14:08.714
until the money--

14:08.816 --> 14:09.749
no.

14:09.851 --> 14:10.754
What?

14:10.856 --> 14:11.988
No, don't talk to her, man.

14:12.090 --> 14:13.051
I didn't even tell
her you were coming.

14:13.153 --> 14:13.985
She knows I'm here.

14:14.087 --> 14:14.921
She saw me too.

14:15.023 --> 14:16.922
Look, look.

14:17.024 --> 14:18.827
She's only 18.

14:18.929 --> 14:20.125
It's not like that, man.

14:20.227 --> 14:22.768
I-- I don't want to--

14:22.870 --> 14:24.735
I just-- I just
want to talk to her.

14:24.837 --> 14:26.569
Oh, and what would you say?

14:26.671 --> 14:27.470
I don't know.

14:27.573 --> 14:28.406
Exactly.

14:28.508 --> 14:29.501
You don't know.

14:29.603 --> 14:31.239
And it's not just the
physical thing, OK?

14:31.341 --> 14:33.340
You see, to you, that's
almost 20 years ago.

14:33.443 --> 14:36.609
But to her, it's only
been a couple months.

14:41.685 --> 14:43.783
Coming?

14:43.885 --> 14:45.455
Yeah.

14:45.557 --> 14:46.426
Yeah.

14:46.528 --> 14:47.486
Watch these steps, too.

14:47.588 --> 14:49.228
Well that's one thing
I need you to fix.

14:49.331 --> 14:50.196
Oh yeah?

14:50.298 --> 14:51.195
Yeah.

16:31.226 --> 16:33.465
Can we take a minute?

16:33.567 --> 16:34.466
I know, I just--

16:34.568 --> 16:36.468
I need a minute.

16:36.570 --> 16:37.662
.

16:37.764 --> 16:40.471
Hey, what do you know
about time dilation?

16:40.573 --> 16:41.374
What?

16:41.476 --> 16:42.302
Time dilation.

16:42.404 --> 16:44.103
You know, time
passes differently

16:44.205 --> 16:45.545
at different speeds.

16:45.647 --> 16:46.741
Like the colony ships?

16:46.843 --> 16:47.907
Right.

16:48.010 --> 16:49.447
Let's go.

16:49.550 --> 16:51.580
Oh, god.

16:51.682 --> 16:54.951
People travel close to the
speed of light, time slows down.

16:55.053 --> 16:56.385
Years are flying by down here.

16:56.487 --> 16:59.059
But for people on the
ships, it's like nothing.

16:59.161 --> 17:00.588
That's why the ships aren't
supposed to come back.

17:00.690 --> 17:03.354
If somebody did, they'd
basically be time traveling.

17:03.456 --> 17:04.663
What are you getting at?

17:04.765 --> 17:06.599
Well, you know Elise?

17:06.701 --> 17:07.930
The girl from the photo?

17:08.032 --> 17:08.897
Your old girlfriend?

17:08.999 --> 17:10.229
Well, right, yeah.

17:10.331 --> 17:12.468
She's, uh, she's back.

17:16.844 --> 17:17.976
What are you talking about?

17:18.078 --> 17:20.674
Her dad got a job
off-world, and she

17:20.776 --> 17:22.678
had to leave on one of the
colony ships when we were,

17:22.781 --> 17:24.081
like, 17.

17:24.183 --> 17:27.279
But, uh, something
went wrong, I guess,

17:27.381 --> 17:29.584
and she had to come back.

17:29.686 --> 17:34.391
So it's like the last 20
years for her didn't happen.

17:36.861 --> 17:38.563
Patrice told me.

17:38.665 --> 17:40.626
Wait a minute.

17:40.728 --> 17:43.703
Your old girlfriend
came back from space.

17:43.805 --> 17:45.331
And she's still a teenager.

17:45.433 --> 17:48.308
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

17:48.410 --> 17:49.609
Wow.

17:49.711 --> 17:53.474
Honey, I had no idea.

17:53.576 --> 17:57.209
You thought
that I'd be jealous?

17:57.311 --> 17:58.318
Oh, I don't know.

17:58.420 --> 17:59.782
Maybe.

17:59.884 --> 18:00.717
It's weird.

18:00.819 --> 18:02.714
It's amazing.

18:02.816 --> 18:05.217
I read an article all
about it last year.

18:05.319 --> 18:06.623
I'd invite her over.

18:06.725 --> 18:07.560
Really?

18:07.662 --> 18:09.794
Yeah, of course.

18:09.896 --> 18:12.127
She came back from space!

18:12.229 --> 18:14.427
And she knew you back then.

18:14.529 --> 18:17.468
We must invite her
over for dinner.

18:17.570 --> 18:18.768
OK.

18:18.870 --> 18:19.905
Seriously.

18:20.007 --> 18:21.138
You're blowing my
mind right now.

18:21.240 --> 18:22.703
Come on, let's get
your heart rate up.

19:02.409 --> 19:03.310
- Stay here.

19:03.412 --> 19:04.514
I'll get some paper towels.

19:30.244 --> 19:31.739
You've got to stop
doing this to yourself.

19:35.149 --> 19:37.175
You already have
enough health problems.

19:37.278 --> 19:40.019
I'm fine.

19:40.121 --> 19:43.016
It's just-- it's
just food poisoning.

19:46.793 --> 19:47.722
Whatever.

19:50.158 --> 19:51.297
Coming!

19:57.903 --> 19:58.832
Hi, Elise.

20:02.642 --> 20:04.704
Hi.

20:04.806 --> 20:08.779
Uh, Patrice told me
you were living here.

20:11.214 --> 20:12.351
Is everything OK?

20:19.158 --> 20:20.623
Sorry, is it-- is it a bad time?

20:40.147 --> 20:41.479
Never thought
I'd see you again.

20:43.783 --> 20:44.713
Me too.

20:51.685 --> 20:54.087
You dropped this at the store.

20:54.189 --> 20:54.990
What?

20:55.092 --> 20:55.926
Your asparagus.

20:56.028 --> 20:58.326
I bought it for you.

20:58.428 --> 20:59.390
I wasn't buying it, dummy.

20:59.492 --> 21:00.961
I work there.

21:01.063 --> 21:01.898
Oh.

21:04.000 --> 21:04.966
OK.

21:05.069 --> 21:06.067
All right.

21:06.169 --> 21:07.004
Thank you.

21:07.106 --> 21:08.033
Yeah, no, of course.

21:10.976 --> 21:13.512
You look so old.

21:13.614 --> 21:14.240
OK.

21:14.342 --> 21:16.982
Wow, thank you.

21:17.084 --> 21:19.545
I guess 20 years will do that.

21:19.647 --> 21:21.283
And you dress like a salesman.

21:21.385 --> 21:24.823
I am dressed like a--

21:24.925 --> 21:28.822
So listen.

21:28.924 --> 21:32.357
I wanted to invite you
to dinner tomorrow night.

21:32.459 --> 21:33.895
I mean, we.

21:33.997 --> 21:37.834
We wanted to invite you to
dinner-- my wife and I. Maggie.

21:37.936 --> 21:39.502
Maggie?

21:39.605 --> 21:43.302
- Yeah, I've been
married five years now.

21:43.404 --> 21:45.541
Five years.

21:45.643 --> 21:49.849
I was hoping we could
catch up, you know?

21:49.951 --> 21:51.517
You can bring your dad.

21:51.619 --> 21:54.552
I know he was never really fond
of me, but I'd love to see him.

21:57.287 --> 21:58.221
So what do you say?

21:58.323 --> 22:00.388
We're staying at the lake house.

22:00.490 --> 22:02.320
Do you remember where it is?

22:02.422 --> 22:03.522
Yeah.

22:03.624 --> 22:05.224
Like it was yesterday.

22:05.326 --> 22:06.566
Right.

22:06.668 --> 22:08.259
Yeah.

22:08.361 --> 22:10.231
Um.

22:10.333 --> 22:12.968
So, tomorrow night?

22:13.071 --> 22:14.607
Say,- 00?

22:14.709 --> 22:16.071
Sure.

22:16.173 --> 22:17.841
- 00 could work.

22:17.944 --> 22:18.873
OK then.

22:21.381 --> 22:22.712
Great, I'll see
you tomorrow night.

22:47.039 --> 22:47.935
- Elise!

23:04.223 --> 23:05.691
Who's the fifth person?

23:05.794 --> 23:06.823
Patrice.

23:06.925 --> 23:08.020
Ah.

23:08.122 --> 23:10.021
He couldn't work today,
but he can come to dinner?

23:10.123 --> 23:11.524
Well, I thought it'd
be nice for Elise.

23:11.626 --> 23:12.930
Does it matter?
- No.

23:13.032 --> 23:13.925
No, it's fine.

23:14.027 --> 23:15.528
Um, listen, I need
you to hold still.

23:15.630 --> 23:16.830
I've got Roger.
He's--

23:16.932 --> 23:18.069
No, no, no, I don't
want to talk to him--

23:18.171 --> 23:19.071
- Jacky-Jack!
Boo!

23:19.173 --> 23:21.038
You handsome fuck.

23:21.140 --> 23:22.071
How are you, man?

23:22.173 --> 23:23.108
Hi, Roger.

23:23.210 --> 23:24.371
Ah, buddy, I miss you so much.

23:24.473 --> 23:25.607
You get my messages?

23:25.709 --> 23:26.905
Nope, we've been
on a media blackout.

23:27.007 --> 23:28.346
ROGER What is that?

23:28.448 --> 23:29.478
Is that some sort
of a new party drug?

23:29.580 --> 23:30.511
You gonna share
with Uncle Roger?

23:30.613 --> 23:31.779
I'm kind of busy here, Roger.

23:31.881 --> 23:32.910
ROGER
Yeah, I'll be quick.

23:33.012 --> 23:34.152
Good news.
It turns out the kid?

23:34.254 --> 23:34.919
Not hearing loss, just a tumor.

23:35.021 --> 23:35.887
Dodged a bullet.

23:35.989 --> 23:37.023
Oh my god.

23:37.125 --> 23:38.290
Second piece of good news.

23:38.392 --> 23:40.223
Turns out Janet
Chang had a stroke.

23:40.325 --> 23:41.525
How is that good news?

23:41.627 --> 23:43.090
ROGER
Relax, she'll be fine.

23:43.192 --> 23:44.861
They got the nanobots in there.
They're cleaning things out.

23:44.963 --> 23:46.465
And in a few months, she's be
back to scowling at people.

23:46.567 --> 23:48.131
My point is, she's not
going to be able to enter

23:48.233 --> 23:50.130
the governor's race.

23:50.232 --> 23:51.436
OK.

23:51.538 --> 23:52.434
ROGER
Which means only Folger

23:52.536 --> 23:53.632
is left for the nomination.

23:53.734 --> 23:54.905
Everybody knows he's weak.

23:55.007 --> 23:56.001
Wait.

23:56.103 --> 23:57.607
We couldn't have asked
for a better timing.

23:57.709 --> 23:59.406
You've got a very high
profile right now.

23:59.508 --> 24:00.642
Folger is old news.

24:00.744 --> 24:02.073
Yeah, but everybody
thinks I'm crazy.

24:02.175 --> 24:03.646
ROGER
Forget about that, man.

24:03.748 --> 24:05.183
People liked your
passion when they saw

24:05.285 --> 24:06.483
you yelling at that kid, OK?

24:06.585 --> 24:09.218
They just didn't
know you well enough.

24:09.320 --> 24:10.119
What are you doing?

24:10.221 --> 24:11.188
There's a line.

24:11.290 --> 24:12.590
Where are you, Roger?

24:12.692 --> 24:15.027
Oh, dude, I'm at this new
place called Bread Line.

24:15.129 --> 24:15.820
Doesn't that look awful?

24:15.922 --> 24:17.388
Yeah, my wife sent me here.

24:17.490 --> 24:18.892
You gotta wait in this line,
and when you get to the front

24:18.994 --> 24:20.165
they give you bread.
Anyway, listen to me.

24:20.267 --> 24:21.433
Jack, you keep doing your thing.

24:21.535 --> 24:23.630
You show people that
you're a family man.

24:23.732 --> 24:25.300
Light that fire in your belly.

24:25.402 --> 24:26.703
He's right, Jack.

24:26.805 --> 24:27.900
ROGER And
then you put a little fire

24:28.002 --> 24:28.741
in Maggie's belly.
Am I right, Mags?

24:29.970 --> 24:31.344
Yeah, well, it's
a big decision.

24:31.446 --> 24:32.539
ROGER
It's a big decision.

24:32.641 --> 24:33.574
You got a little time.

24:33.676 --> 24:34.608
But listen, just a little time.

24:34.710 --> 24:35.945
Ideally, call me back tomorrow.

24:36.047 --> 24:36.675
OK?

24:36.777 --> 24:37.643
We'll figure this out.

24:37.745 --> 24:38.777
I swear to God, touch me.

24:38.879 --> 24:41.482
Go ahead, touch my fucking arm.

24:41.584 --> 24:42.484
That goes for all of you.

24:42.586 --> 24:44.018
I swear to God, it's a line.

24:49.964 --> 24:51.060
Governor?

24:51.163 --> 24:52.327
Why not?

25:07.073 --> 25:10.081
Just dinner, and
then we're gone.

25:10.183 --> 25:11.111
Don't start, Dad.

25:14.716 --> 25:16.116
Hi, come on in, guys.

25:25.362 --> 25:27.199
Hi, Hank.

25:27.301 --> 25:29.297
You look just like your father.

25:29.399 --> 25:30.230
Great, thanks.

25:30.332 --> 25:31.169
Hi.

25:31.271 --> 25:32.235
I'm Maggie, Jack's wife.

25:32.337 --> 25:33.169
Nice to meet you.

25:33.271 --> 25:35.202
Hi, Elise.

25:35.304 --> 25:36.235
Hi.

25:40.144 --> 25:40.979
Hi.

25:41.081 --> 25:41.977
Come here.

25:44.714 --> 25:47.117
Oh my god, you're adorable.

25:47.219 --> 25:48.315
Thank you.

25:48.417 --> 25:49.316
May I?

25:49.418 --> 25:50.251
Sure.

25:50.354 --> 25:51.316
Thank you.

25:57.059 --> 25:58.759
Um, is it cool if we drink this?
- Oh, yeah.

25:58.861 --> 26:00.026
- Gimme that.
- Dear god please.

26:00.128 --> 26:01.326
- Let's do that right now.
- I'll get it.

26:03.897 --> 26:06.901
I'll tell you something.

26:07.003 --> 26:11.704
When you watch things
change, you barely

26:11.806 --> 26:13.712
even notice it happening.

26:13.814 --> 26:21.049
Skip ahead 20 years, and you
really see how things are.

26:21.618 --> 26:22.886
Everything looks old.

26:25.456 --> 26:26.891
Everybody looks fat.

26:26.993 --> 26:32.391
I told your father
he needed to keep things up

26:32.493 --> 26:35.363
better around here, but he
never listened to anybody other

26:35.465 --> 26:36.333
than himself.

26:36.435 --> 26:37.534
Wouldn't argue with that.

26:37.636 --> 26:39.872
So you knew
Jack's father well?

26:39.974 --> 26:42.035
Uh-uh.

26:42.137 --> 26:44.944
Actually, I met him
because of these two.

26:45.046 --> 26:46.476
- Oh.

26:46.578 --> 26:50.248
Jack never told me how you met.

26:50.350 --> 26:51.447
We met at the movies.

26:51.549 --> 26:53.183
Outside of the movies.

26:53.285 --> 26:54.847
Come on, Jack!

26:54.949 --> 26:57.351
You wrote a whole poem about it.

26:57.453 --> 26:59.291
A poem?

26:59.393 --> 27:01.921
It's disgustingly romantic.

27:02.023 --> 27:03.522
You don't want
to hear about it.

27:03.625 --> 27:04.725
Oh, I do.

27:04.827 --> 27:06.265
I was with a friend of mine.

27:06.367 --> 27:08.961
My best friend Claire, actually.

27:09.063 --> 27:10.464
Do you know she's
born again now?

27:10.566 --> 27:11.668
Oh yeah, yeah.

27:11.770 --> 27:15.006
She used to be a
hardcore punk atheist.

27:15.109 --> 27:16.475
So weird.

27:16.577 --> 27:19.206
Anyway, we were at
the ticket stand.

27:22.781 --> 27:25.311
And I only had pockets
full of change.

27:28.219 --> 27:32.955
So I was counting out the
coins, and a boy bumped into me.

27:33.057 --> 27:37.562
And then there were coins
bouncing everywhere.

27:37.664 --> 27:39.431
But one of them
landed on its side.

27:39.533 --> 27:41.831
It started rolling
down the line,

27:41.934 --> 27:47.031
and it weaved left and
right, around people,

27:47.133 --> 27:51.005
like it had a mind of its own.

27:51.107 --> 27:53.541
I mean, it even hopped
over someone's foot

27:53.643 --> 27:56.210
and kept rolling.

27:56.312 --> 28:00.315
I was standing at the back
of the line with Patrice,

28:00.418 --> 28:01.353
actually.

28:01.455 --> 28:04.182
Yeah, I saw the whole thing.

28:04.284 --> 28:07.193
We were-- we were
just goofing around,

28:07.295 --> 28:08.353
doing I don't know what.

28:08.455 --> 28:12.058
But all of a sudden,
there was this commotion.

28:12.160 --> 28:14.564
And I looked down,
and this coin's just

28:14.666 --> 28:16.462
heading straight toward me.

28:16.564 --> 28:20.800
It was weird because even
back then, nobody used coins.

28:20.902 --> 28:23.209
So it just zigs and zags.

28:23.311 --> 28:25.543
It didn't make sense.

28:25.645 --> 28:29.276
And then it just
came right to me.

28:31.881 --> 28:33.478
I stood up, and there she was.

28:41.459 --> 28:43.822
There you were.

28:43.924 --> 28:46.662
You were my hero.

28:46.764 --> 28:48.663
And then you stole from me.

28:48.765 --> 28:50.796
I paid for your movie.

28:50.898 --> 28:52.129
You kept my coin.

28:52.232 --> 28:53.867
I tried to give
it back to you.

28:53.969 --> 28:55.403
Like that kind of asparagus.

28:57.342 --> 28:58.243
What?

28:58.345 --> 28:59.337
Yeah, it's nothing.

28:59.439 --> 29:01.375
When I bumped into
Jack at the market, I--

29:01.477 --> 29:05.815
I dropped a can of asparagus,
and he brought it back to me.

29:05.917 --> 29:09.650
Didn't realize I
worked there, I guess.

29:09.752 --> 29:11.155
Disgusting, right?

29:11.257 --> 29:12.187
It is.

29:16.596 --> 29:19.297
How did you and Jack meet?

29:19.399 --> 29:21.098
We met at a bar.

29:21.200 --> 29:23.864
Oh

29:23.966 --> 29:26.568
Yeah, Jack was very drunk.

29:26.670 --> 29:27.568
I was very drunk.

29:29.740 --> 29:31.070
And we both wanted pizza.

29:31.172 --> 29:32.643
We had that in
common right away.

29:32.745 --> 29:36.278
So we went out and
we found pizza.

29:36.380 --> 29:43.521
And the next day, he called me
and he didn't remember my name.

29:43.623 --> 29:46.086
I thought he was such a jerk.

29:46.188 --> 29:47.756
And then I gave
him another chance,

29:47.858 --> 29:51.991
and he cleaned up quite nicely.

29:52.093 --> 29:54.700
We were married two years later.

29:54.802 --> 29:59.668
It wasn't very romantic,
but relationships,

29:59.770 --> 30:01.540
they change and they grow.

30:01.642 --> 30:03.941
And it's not about
how they start.

30:04.043 --> 30:09.211
It's about all the nights
in those bad motels,

30:09.313 --> 30:13.678
and the takeout, and sitting
in the church meetings,

30:13.780 --> 30:18.550
and the ballgames, and all
of the long drives in the car

30:18.652 --> 30:22.222
going up and down the state
listening to constituents.

30:22.324 --> 30:25.089
Trying to make a
difference in their lives.

30:25.191 --> 30:27.661
That's what I cherish.

30:33.771 --> 30:35.734
That's what I cherish.

30:35.836 --> 30:38.309
Sorry.

30:38.411 --> 30:39.309
More wine?

30:39.411 --> 30:40.308
Yes.

30:42.744 --> 30:44.944
Elise.

30:45.046 --> 30:47.412
What was that trip like?

30:47.514 --> 30:49.147
I mean, not many people
have gone that far

30:49.249 --> 30:51.687
and then come all the way back.

30:51.789 --> 30:53.885
I don't really remember.

30:53.987 --> 30:55.360
We were asleep.

30:55.462 --> 30:56.721
Didn't you dream?

30:56.823 --> 30:57.956
No.

30:58.058 --> 30:59.824
I don't think so.

30:59.927 --> 31:01.597
Nothing?

31:01.699 --> 31:04.263
I remember pieces.

31:04.365 --> 31:07.671
The heavy clang of
the chamber door.

31:07.773 --> 31:09.535
The coolness against my skin.

31:11.978 --> 31:14.375
I remember my eyes
getting really heavy,

31:14.477 --> 31:19.817
and then this feeling of
sort of falling back like you

31:19.919 --> 31:22.351
get when you're
just almost asleep.

31:22.453 --> 31:28.156
Except I couldn't reach out
to catch myself or to wake up.

31:28.258 --> 31:31.288
I just kept falling
back into what felt

31:31.390 --> 31:35.598
like an infinite nothingness.

31:35.700 --> 31:37.666
That sounds awful.

31:37.768 --> 31:40.105
It was peaceful.

31:40.207 --> 31:44.902
I imagine it's what a baby
feels like in its mother's womb.

31:45.005 --> 31:46.173
Floating.

31:46.275 --> 31:48.948
You didn't feel
all that time pass?

31:49.050 --> 31:50.747
When you're in a different
state of consciousness,

31:50.849 --> 31:52.148
you don't feel time pass at all.

31:52.250 --> 31:56.219
I mean, it could have been
a second or 100 years.

31:58.456 --> 32:01.854
When I finally opened my eyes
and looked out the window,

32:01.956 --> 32:08.365
it was so big.

32:08.467 --> 32:10.765
Larger.

32:10.867 --> 32:12.237
What's that word?

32:12.339 --> 32:13.601
Vast.

32:13.703 --> 32:16.207
Vast.

32:16.309 --> 32:23.543
So many stars and colors and
spirals and glowing clusters.

32:24.818 --> 32:26.183
I thought I'd feel
small surrounded

32:26.285 --> 32:33.522
by all that darkness, but
instead it was beautiful.

32:34.024 --> 32:37.693
And vast mystery all around you.

32:37.795 --> 32:40.763
But I wasn't afraid.

32:40.865 --> 32:42.034
I was filled with wonder.

32:46.233 --> 32:49.201
What about the colonies?

32:49.303 --> 32:52.040
It was a fucking disaster.

32:52.142 --> 32:54.877
For starters, they
grossly oversold

32:54.979 --> 32:56.108
how fast things were moving.

32:56.210 --> 32:58.412
They were barely at 20%.

32:58.514 --> 33:01.017
Atmospheric complications,
structural integrity

33:01.119 --> 33:03.083
issues, and don't
even get me started

33:03.185 --> 33:05.118
on the government corruption.

33:05.220 --> 33:07.124
See, they couldn't take us all.

33:07.226 --> 33:10.494
So some genius decided to
have a fucking lottery.

33:10.596 --> 33:11.395
A lottery?

33:11.498 --> 33:12.427
For what?

33:14.727 --> 33:17.295
To determine who
would get to stay, Jack.

33:17.397 --> 33:18.463
- But y'all got that--

33:18.565 --> 33:20.737
that big settlement
though, right?

33:20.839 --> 33:22.506
- That was a joke too.

33:22.608 --> 33:23.774
20 years, gone.

33:23.876 --> 33:27.104
Just like that.

33:27.206 --> 33:28.639
And for what?

33:28.741 --> 33:32.348
I mean, all my friends
are retired old men.

33:32.450 --> 33:37.385
My body's gone to
shit from the Hibernation.

33:37.487 --> 33:40.455
And to top it all off, I
don't have a fucking job.

33:42.923 --> 33:47.633
You know what's really funny is
they haven't even given Elise

33:47.735 --> 33:49.901
here her money yet because--

33:50.003 --> 33:54.972
now, get this--
she just turned 18.

33:55.074 --> 33:57.970
She was born almost
40 years ago!

33:58.072 --> 33:59.773
Easy, Dad.

33:59.876 --> 34:00.805
I'm fine.

34:03.643 --> 34:05.980
Bureaucratic
jackasses, all of them.

34:06.082 --> 34:07.349
You know something, Hank?

34:07.451 --> 34:08.780
When I was a Congressman,
one of my key issues

34:08.882 --> 34:11.887
was protecting colonists
from corporate malfeasance.

34:11.989 --> 34:13.285
Especially the children.

34:13.387 --> 34:14.890
Were you able to do something?

34:14.992 --> 34:17.029
We did help some kids.

34:17.131 --> 34:18.829
I wanted a stronger
bill, but there was a lot

34:18.931 --> 34:21.266
of money on the other side.

34:21.368 --> 34:24.465
In the end, the legislation
wasn't exactly what I wanted.

34:24.567 --> 34:28.437
But, well, we had to make
a lot of compromises.

34:28.539 --> 34:31.135
You're more like your father

34:31.237 --> 34:33.637
than I thought.

34:33.739 --> 34:36.511
Big promises and
delivers very little.

34:39.684 --> 34:40.614
Cheers.

34:56.163 --> 34:57.799
Hey, you OK?

34:57.901 --> 34:58.799
Yeah, I'm fine.

34:58.901 --> 34:59.798
Good.

35:04.040 --> 35:06.774
Weird scene, huh?

35:06.876 --> 35:08.246
Yeah.

35:08.348 --> 35:09.846
It's always strange when
your wife and your girlfriend

35:09.948 --> 35:11.216
meet for the first time.

35:15.422 --> 35:17.719
Hey, why don't you bring
Hank on to work with you here?

35:20.786 --> 35:22.620
Because
he's an asshole.

35:22.722 --> 35:26.192
Come on,
he knows the place.

35:26.294 --> 35:29.001
And he needs the work.

35:29.103 --> 35:32.430
Jack, you're both
about the same age now.

35:32.532 --> 35:35.805
You don't have to impress him.

35:35.907 --> 35:39.203
As a favor to me.

35:39.305 --> 35:44.216
OK.

35:44.318 --> 35:48.451
But if he shows up to work
drunk, I get to drink too.

35:54.289 --> 35:55.388
Where should I put this?

35:55.490 --> 35:58.461
Oh, uh, you can
put them anywhere.

36:01.528 --> 36:02.765
I don't mind washing them.

36:02.867 --> 36:03.796
Oh, it's fine.

36:05.703 --> 36:08.306
In my kitchen at home, you just
throw the dishes in the sink,

36:08.408 --> 36:10.440
and the next day you can
pull them out of the cabinet.

36:13.341 --> 36:15.109
How does it do that?

36:15.211 --> 36:17.541
I don't really know.

36:17.643 --> 36:19.847
Is that a friendship bracelet?

36:19.949 --> 36:21.314
Yeah.

36:21.416 --> 36:23.021
My friend Claire made it for me.

36:23.123 --> 36:25.383
I used to wear
those all the time.

36:25.485 --> 36:27.924
Are they back in style?

36:28.026 --> 36:30.124
I don't-- I don't know.

36:30.226 --> 36:31.826
They were when I left.

36:31.929 --> 36:33.064
Oh, yeah.

36:33.166 --> 36:34.630
Guess that's when
I was wearing them.

36:34.732 --> 36:37.436
Yeah, we were probably in high
school around the same time,

36:37.538 --> 36:38.767
right?

36:38.870 --> 36:40.970
Probably.

36:41.072 --> 36:43.735
What a strange thought.

36:43.837 --> 36:46.473
Anyway, they should
be in here helping us.

36:46.575 --> 36:49.373
Did you see Patrice
hand me his plate?

36:49.475 --> 36:50.274
Don't get me wrong.

36:50.376 --> 36:51.411
I like him.

36:51.513 --> 36:52.880
But he's a little
immature, right?

36:52.982 --> 36:53.815
Yes.

36:53.917 --> 36:55.287
Yeah.

36:55.389 --> 36:58.719
He's one of the few people
who hasn't changed at all.

36:58.821 --> 37:02.253
I'm sure it must be
somewhat overwhelming for you.

37:02.355 --> 37:03.891
All of this.

37:03.994 --> 37:05.694
It's OK.

37:05.796 --> 37:08.393
Have you thought about what
you wanted to do with your life

37:08.495 --> 37:09.832
now that you're back?

37:09.934 --> 37:10.965
Not really.

37:11.067 --> 37:12.837
Travel, maybe.

37:12.939 --> 37:14.971
Here on Earth, I mean.

37:15.073 --> 37:16.138
Just go out and get lost.

37:16.240 --> 37:18.140
I've never really been anywhere.

37:18.242 --> 37:20.038
New Orleans once, with my mom.

37:20.140 --> 37:23.811
Well, you really shouldn't
waste such a great opportunity.

37:23.913 --> 37:27.612
Most people don't get to see how
everybody they know turned out.

37:27.714 --> 37:29.415
You can learn from
their mistakes.

37:29.517 --> 37:31.455
Make all the right decisions.

37:31.557 --> 37:35.391
When I was your age, I
knew exactly what I wanted.

37:35.493 --> 37:37.624
I knew the college I
needed to get into,

37:37.726 --> 37:40.295
the internships that
would help my resume,

37:40.397 --> 37:43.198
the law firm to
launch my career.

37:43.300 --> 37:46.363
I had a plan, and I executed it.

37:46.465 --> 37:47.699
Sounds fun.

37:47.801 --> 37:49.071
If you want to
amount to anything,

37:49.173 --> 37:52.007
you need to have a plan.

37:52.109 --> 37:54.611
What am I saying?

37:54.713 --> 37:58.917
I remember when I was your age,
in one ear and out the other.

37:59.019 --> 38:00.950
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

38:01.052 --> 38:01.952
I'm sure I will.

38:02.054 --> 38:03.921
That is quite a dress.

38:04.023 --> 38:05.256
Thanks, I wasn't sure--

38:05.358 --> 38:09.524
But remember, with
blush, less is more.

38:09.627 --> 38:11.759
Otherwise, it looks like
you're trying too hard.

39:06.515 --> 39:09.248
I don't need your charity.

39:09.350 --> 39:10.182
Hank, come on.

39:10.284 --> 39:11.187
Please.

39:11.289 --> 39:14.050
Patrice could use the help.

39:14.153 --> 39:16.522
Because it worked out
so well the last time

39:16.624 --> 39:19.790
a Lambert tried to help me.

39:19.892 --> 39:22.161
Jack, do you
still paddleboard?

39:22.263 --> 39:23.629
What?

39:23.731 --> 39:25.934
Your old gear
is in the closet.

39:26.036 --> 39:27.068
You?

39:27.170 --> 39:30.271
Paddleboarding?

39:30.373 --> 39:31.338
Yeah, well, you know.

39:31.440 --> 39:32.706
It's been a while, but--

39:32.808 --> 39:36.409
I am learning all sorts
of things about you.

39:36.511 --> 39:39.081
We should do it again.

39:39.183 --> 39:41.282
I don't think so.

39:41.384 --> 39:42.684
I can't even imagine it.

39:42.786 --> 39:45.118
You're, like, the least
coordinated person I know.

39:45.220 --> 39:46.423
Hey.

39:46.525 --> 39:48.089
I'd like to see you
in that wet suit again.

39:48.191 --> 39:49.258
So would I.

39:49.361 --> 39:50.325
Yeah, you would
like to see it.

39:50.427 --> 39:51.796
I wear it like a second skin.

39:51.898 --> 39:53.227
It's beautiful.

39:53.329 --> 39:54.659
Then it's a plan.

39:54.761 --> 39:57.228
Tomorrow I have the day off.

39:57.330 --> 39:59.003
Oh.

39:59.105 --> 40:00.265
Sure, yeah.
Sure.

40:00.367 --> 40:01.167
Why not?

40:01.269 --> 40:02.234
Yeah.

40:02.337 --> 40:03.741
Tomorrow.

40:03.843 --> 40:04.773
Cool.

40:08.345 --> 40:09.613
- I'm not ovulating.

40:12.985 --> 40:13.914
That was nice.

40:16.449 --> 40:17.283
Really?

40:17.385 --> 40:18.648
- Yeah.

40:18.750 --> 40:19.854
I think she's sweet.

40:24.357 --> 40:28.264
Why didn't you tell me you
saw her in the grocery store?

40:28.366 --> 40:31.128
I thought I was going crazy.

40:31.230 --> 40:34.534
Just wanted to wait until
I talked to Patrice.

40:34.636 --> 40:35.969
That must be really strange.

40:38.445 --> 40:40.374
She's obviously still
in love with you.

40:40.476 --> 40:41.976
No, she's just a kid.

40:42.078 --> 40:45.984
When you're that age, you feel
different one week to the next.

40:46.086 --> 40:48.746
You know what I mean.

40:48.848 --> 40:51.956
Honestly, I feel bad for her.

40:52.058 --> 40:53.518
She'll get over it.

40:53.620 --> 40:54.823
You're a good man.

41:02.366 --> 41:04.296
Oh, did you not want to?

41:04.398 --> 41:06.096
Do you?

41:06.198 --> 41:09.203
Well, I know you're
not ovulating, but--

41:09.305 --> 41:12.703
I-- we can.

41:12.805 --> 41:14.645
Oh, only if you want to.

41:33.859 --> 41:35.666
Oh, yeah, I got this.

41:49.644 --> 41:51.143
Looking amazing, honey!

42:07.099 --> 42:08.163
Ah, thank you.

42:08.265 --> 42:10.035
You're welcome.

42:10.137 --> 42:11.968
You must be so proud.

42:12.070 --> 42:12.762
Yeah.

42:12.864 --> 42:15.139
He's trying, anyway.

42:15.241 --> 42:16.137
Was he ever any good?

42:16.240 --> 42:17.641
Oh yeah.

42:17.743 --> 42:20.306
When he was 15, everybody
thought he was the shit.

42:20.408 --> 42:21.240
Really?

42:21.342 --> 42:22.311
No.

42:22.413 --> 42:23.313
He's always been awful.

42:23.415 --> 42:24.508
He just owned all the stuff.

42:26.015 --> 42:27.477
We used to lay the equipment
all out on the beach

42:27.579 --> 42:30.747
and pretend to be busy with
all the pretty girls walked by.

42:30.849 --> 42:32.349
Did that ever work?

42:32.451 --> 42:36.622
Sometimes, but Jack met
Elise, and I was left alone

42:36.724 --> 42:38.592
with all the pretty girls.

42:38.694 --> 42:40.327
Looks like nothing's changed.

42:40.429 --> 42:41.327
Woo-hoo-hoo.

42:45.803 --> 42:47.399
- And you're
still terrible at this.

42:47.502 --> 42:48.336
- Hey.

42:48.438 --> 42:49.468
It's been a while.

42:49.570 --> 42:50.605
- How long?

42:50.707 --> 42:53.273
Well, the last
time was with you.

42:53.375 --> 42:54.340
What?

42:54.442 --> 42:55.710
Yeah.

42:55.812 --> 42:58.116
I haven't been back
here in 20 years.

42:58.218 --> 42:58.842
What about your dad?

42:58.944 --> 43:00.246
Didn't you ever visit?

43:00.348 --> 43:01.485
No.

43:01.587 --> 43:02.817
Stopped talking to
him a long time ago.

43:02.919 --> 43:04.982
Occasional messages,
birthday card, whatever.

43:05.084 --> 43:09.953
But we kind of
had a falling out.

43:10.055 --> 43:11.991
Because of what he did to us?

43:12.093 --> 43:13.731
- There were other
issues, but yeah.

43:16.236 --> 43:17.535
I was pretty furious.

43:17.637 --> 43:20.338
I asked him to help
your dad with a job.

43:20.440 --> 43:23.270
The next thing I
know, you're gone.

43:23.372 --> 43:24.474
Forever.

43:24.576 --> 43:27.540
Yeah, Hank didn't
have to take it.

43:27.642 --> 43:29.178
I hate them both.

43:29.280 --> 43:30.847
- Don't.

43:30.949 --> 43:34.419
Now that my dad's gone, I
wish I hadn't cut him out.

43:34.521 --> 43:37.216
He was just doing
the best he could.

43:37.318 --> 43:40.087
It seemed like the end of
the world to me, you know.

43:40.189 --> 43:46.296
But the way he saw it, your
family got an opportunity,

43:46.398 --> 43:49.067
and I was just a teenager.

43:49.169 --> 43:50.097
I'd get over you.

43:52.633 --> 43:55.874
And are you?

43:55.976 --> 43:58.069
Over me?

43:58.171 --> 44:01.780
I never imagined
Jack as a governor.

44:01.882 --> 44:05.816
He's got a lot of work to
get there, but you'll see it.

44:05.918 --> 44:09.186
Seems like a pretty big
decision to make so quickly.

44:09.288 --> 44:10.720
Y'all just got here.

44:10.822 --> 44:12.553
Ah, it'll be good to
get back out there,

44:12.655 --> 44:14.120
not dwell on the past.

44:14.222 --> 44:16.887
Keep moving forward until
you get what you want.

44:16.989 --> 44:18.823
And that's what he wants?

44:18.925 --> 44:21.928
It's what we both want?

44:22.030 --> 44:24.197
It seemed to me
like he wants a break.

44:29.609 --> 44:31.006
Wonder what they're
talking about.

44:33.645 --> 44:34.977
Don't you have
some work to do?

44:45.955 --> 44:48.424
That is not what
I'm trying to say.

44:48.526 --> 44:49.956
It can't be both ways.

44:50.058 --> 44:52.297
Look, what happened
was a meaningful--

44:52.399 --> 44:53.961
it was the most meaningful.

44:54.063 --> 44:57.064
It actually changed
me in a lot of ways.

44:57.166 --> 45:00.132
And so I can still feel
the impact of that summer.

45:00.235 --> 45:04.541
In that respect, I'm not
over any of it at all.

45:04.643 --> 45:05.739
I can't believe
you grew up to be

45:05.841 --> 45:07.742
this bullshit politician, Jack.

45:07.844 --> 45:11.379
The point is,
I had to grow up.

45:11.481 --> 45:12.381
I got married.

45:12.483 --> 45:13.449
I had to move on.

45:13.551 --> 45:15.713
Yeah, so you got over me.

45:15.815 --> 45:17.017
Just say it.

45:17.119 --> 45:19.085
You complain about
talking to a politician?

45:19.188 --> 45:21.886
I forgot what it's like
talking to a teenager.

45:21.988 --> 45:23.687
How long did it take?

45:23.789 --> 45:24.589
What?

45:24.692 --> 45:26.859
How long?

45:26.961 --> 45:28.131
Honestly, Elise, I don't know.

45:28.233 --> 45:29.163
A year?

45:40.108 --> 45:43.375
I'm-- OK, it was
more than a year.

45:46.780 --> 45:48.085
Elise, come on!

45:48.188 --> 45:49.218
Seriously?

45:49.320 --> 45:50.014
Come up.

45:50.116 --> 45:51.355
It was way more than a year.

45:51.457 --> 45:52.586
I-- I didn't mean it.

45:52.688 --> 45:54.058
Elise!
Come up--

45:54.953 --> 45:57.659
Jesus Christ.

45:57.761 --> 45:58.962
You scared the shit out of me.

46:03.228 --> 46:05.168
How long was I underwater?

46:05.270 --> 46:05.964
What?

46:06.066 --> 46:08.304
How long was I underwater?

46:08.406 --> 46:09.206
I don't know.

46:09.308 --> 46:10.669
30 seconds?

46:10.771 --> 46:11.603
30 seconds.

46:11.705 --> 46:13.309
Good.

46:13.411 --> 46:15.779
Now you know.

46:15.881 --> 46:17.409
That's how long it took
me to get over you.

46:35.234 --> 46:36.133
Here.

46:36.236 --> 46:38.862
I got it.

46:38.964 --> 46:40.070
Hey, I'm sorry.

46:40.172 --> 46:41.070
OK?

46:44.243 --> 46:45.472
Friends?

46:45.575 --> 46:46.504
Whatever.

46:52.081 --> 46:53.316
ROGER
How do I look?

46:53.418 --> 46:54.450
Do I look good?

46:54.552 --> 46:55.620
Perfect on our end.

46:55.722 --> 46:56.751
ROGER
OK, listen, this

46:56.853 --> 46:58.423
is what's called camera ready.

46:58.525 --> 46:59.390
This is what it looks like.

46:59.492 --> 47:00.591
I want you to soak it in.

47:00.693 --> 47:02.089
I'm wearing a shit
ton of makeup,

47:02.192 --> 47:04.795
but I still look like
I could kick your ass.

47:04.898 --> 47:08.060
This is what I need you
to look like tomorrow.

47:08.162 --> 47:09.660
Uh, what are
you talking about?

47:09.762 --> 47:13.798
What I'm talking about is your
first interview as a candidate.

47:13.900 --> 47:15.035
You like that?

47:15.137 --> 47:17.037
Roger, I haven't
made a decision yet.

47:17.139 --> 47:18.839
We're not going
to actually declare.

47:18.941 --> 47:20.642
This is just to test the waters.

47:20.744 --> 47:21.811
You knew about this?

47:21.913 --> 47:22.843
ROGER Buddy, there

47:22.945 --> 47:24.144
was a last-minute cancellation.

47:24.246 --> 47:25.846
Karen Keeley really
wanted to talk to you.

47:25.948 --> 47:27.347
That show does not ask twice.

47:29.952 --> 47:31.621
It's just such short notice.

47:31.724 --> 47:33.019
Well, so it was
my last divorce,

47:33.121 --> 47:34.525
but that turned
out to be a gift.

47:34.627 --> 47:36.219
You need to seize the moment.

47:36.321 --> 47:39.629
I want you to carpe scrotum.

47:39.731 --> 47:40.858
The kids love you right now.

47:40.960 --> 47:41.995
Right, Mags?

47:42.097 --> 47:43.094
People need to
know you're still

47:43.196 --> 47:45.030
out there and not defeated.

47:45.132 --> 47:46.396
You don't have to declare yet.

47:46.498 --> 47:48.197
You can back out if
you still want to.

47:48.299 --> 47:49.532
ROGER Yeah.

47:49.635 --> 47:51.171
I mean, if you want to
back out, you still can.

47:51.274 --> 47:53.308
What this is, though,
is maybe an opportunity

47:53.410 --> 47:56.546
to shore up that youth vote
with a little focus on family

47:56.648 --> 47:57.814
values for the blue hairs.

47:57.916 --> 47:59.680
Maggie's got all
the talking points.

47:59.782 --> 48:00.781
Listen to me, Jack.

48:00.883 --> 48:02.212
I know, I'm hilarious.

48:02.314 --> 48:03.983
But right now I'm being serious.

48:04.085 --> 48:05.418
I've done this for a decade.

48:05.520 --> 48:08.491
I've only lost once, and
I'm not going to lose twice.

48:08.593 --> 48:09.460
That Senate thing?

48:09.562 --> 48:10.693
That was an appetizer.

48:10.795 --> 48:12.361
We're going to carpe scrotum.

48:12.463 --> 48:13.593
Carpe.

48:13.695 --> 48:14.592
Scrotum.

48:18.101 --> 48:20.200
I thought we were
taking a time out.

48:20.303 --> 48:23.100
Why are we jumping back
into this so quickly?

48:23.202 --> 48:25.172
It's what we have to do.

48:25.275 --> 48:26.972
Well, I thought I might
go back into community

48:27.074 --> 48:28.040
organizing for a while.

48:28.142 --> 48:30.109
Maybe set up a nonprofit again.

48:30.211 --> 48:32.209
We're in debt
from the campaign.

48:32.311 --> 48:33.950
We need to move this house.

48:34.052 --> 48:37.318
We need to pick our
next steps carefully.

48:37.420 --> 48:40.189
Life doesn't stop because
you want to take a break.

48:43.125 --> 48:46.025
Honey, after all
we've worked for,

48:46.127 --> 48:47.691
this is a real second chance.

49:10.855 --> 49:11.885
What are you guys doing here?

49:11.987 --> 49:13.688
Bailing you out, man.

49:13.790 --> 49:16.722
We're going dancing.

49:16.825 --> 49:17.760
I can't.

49:17.862 --> 49:20.495
I gotta prep for this interview.

49:20.597 --> 49:21.432
See?

49:21.534 --> 49:22.192
I told you, Patrice.

49:22.294 --> 49:23.633
He's gonna get in trouble.

49:23.735 --> 49:24.600
I'm gonna get in trouble.

49:24.702 --> 49:27.035
All right, hold on.

49:27.137 --> 49:30.440
Just meet me on the
side of the house.

49:30.542 --> 49:31.438
But be quiet.

49:46.854 --> 49:47.654
Shut up.

49:47.757 --> 49:49.360
Let's go.

49:53.365 --> 49:54.263
ID.

49:59.198 --> 50:00.571
It says you're 38.

50:00.673 --> 50:02.070
Yeah, don't remind me.

50:02.172 --> 50:03.503
In a couple of
years, the big 4-0.

50:07.942 --> 50:08.873
Whatever.

50:08.976 --> 50:10.081
Go on in.

50:16.581 --> 50:19.851
This place hasn't
changed much.

50:19.953 --> 50:21.121
What?

50:21.223 --> 50:23.127
This place hasn't
changed much!

50:26.099 --> 50:29.597
This must bring back
some memories, right?

50:29.699 --> 50:30.693
What?

50:30.795 --> 50:32.364
He said this place
brings back memories!

50:32.466 --> 50:34.998
I don't remember
it being so loud!

50:35.100 --> 50:36.002
What?

50:36.104 --> 50:38.068
I said, it's really loud!

50:38.170 --> 50:40.443
Jack Lambert?

50:40.545 --> 50:41.272
Yeah.

50:41.374 --> 50:43.347
It is Jack Lambert!

50:43.450 --> 50:44.948
Fuck yeah!

50:45.050 --> 50:47.010
This is the dude who
screamed at kids!

50:47.112 --> 50:48.014
What?

50:48.116 --> 50:49.552
You're my hero, man.

50:49.654 --> 50:51.621
I hate kids!

50:51.723 --> 50:53.350
Hey, take a picture.

50:53.452 --> 50:54.852
Oh, no, we don't have to--

50:54.954 --> 50:55.852
OK.

50:59.897 --> 51:01.566
Is this your daughter?

51:01.668 --> 51:03.565
No, I-- I'm his friend.

51:03.667 --> 51:04.667
Cool.

51:04.769 --> 51:05.765
We should all party.

51:05.868 --> 51:08.034
I'm Terry.

51:08.136 --> 51:09.373
That's my girl Celine.

51:09.475 --> 51:10.405
Yeah.

51:13.542 --> 51:15.075
I'm going to go ahead
and get another drink.

51:15.177 --> 51:16.173
No, no, no, I got this one.

51:16.275 --> 51:18.044
Next round's on me.

51:18.146 --> 51:19.012
Great to meet you, Terry.

51:19.114 --> 51:20.780
Elise, do you wanna--

51:20.882 --> 51:21.715
Yeah.

51:21.818 --> 51:23.148
Uh, yeah!

51:23.250 --> 51:24.650
Two Jack and Cokes for us!

51:31.159 --> 51:32.427
You like to party, man?

51:37.003 --> 51:38.998
I think I used to
babysit that guy.

51:39.100 --> 51:41.164
You used to what?

51:41.266 --> 51:43.739
Hey, you OK?

51:43.841 --> 51:44.939
I know this song.

51:45.041 --> 51:45.839
What about the drinks?

51:45.941 --> 51:46.840
Who cares!

51:48.346 --> 51:50.248
--the summer,
the light we grew up with.

51:50.350 --> 51:54.515
We'll forget the past, dear,
and learn to live for this.

51:59.925 --> 52:01.885
We'll learn to live for this.

52:04.893 --> 52:05.889
Oh, oh.

52:29.781 --> 52:31.481
I can't believe
you've never seen it!

52:31.583 --> 52:33.852
Stop being a jerk and show me.

52:33.954 --> 52:35.088
Oh.

52:35.190 --> 52:36.390
All right, but listen.

52:36.492 --> 52:39.624
Keep-- just keep in mind
this was, like, my--

52:39.727 --> 52:43.028
it was, like, my third
stump speech of the day.

52:43.130 --> 52:44.330
Stump speech?

52:44.432 --> 52:46.529
Yeah, that's the
technical term.

52:46.631 --> 52:48.532
JACK Yeah!

52:48.634 --> 52:50.600
Are we gonna fight
for our schools?

52:50.702 --> 52:51.975
CROWD Yeah!

52:52.077 --> 52:53.041
JACK Are we

52:53.143 --> 52:54.175
gonna let them hear our voices?

52:54.277 --> 52:55.442
CROWD Yeah!

52:55.544 --> 52:58.141
Are we gonna win
this race for our kids?

52:58.244 --> 52:59.549
Fuck yeah!

53:04.453 --> 53:06.120
I just got caught
up in the moment.

53:06.222 --> 53:08.253
I don't know, I'm such an idiot.

53:08.355 --> 53:09.321
No, it's-- it's great.

53:09.423 --> 53:11.289
I mean, that's totally you.

53:11.391 --> 53:13.322
That's the Jack I know.

53:13.424 --> 53:14.292
- Jack!

53:14.394 --> 53:15.966
Hey, where you been, man?

53:16.068 --> 53:19.964
Oh man, this guy
Terry is awesome.

53:20.066 --> 53:25.435
He-- he has invited us to a
party to watch some fireworks.

53:25.537 --> 53:27.039
Oh man, I don't know.

53:27.141 --> 53:28.537
Come on, Jack.

53:28.639 --> 53:30.274
Get caught in the moment.

53:30.376 --> 53:32.011
"Fuck yeah," right?

53:32.113 --> 53:33.209
All right.

53:33.312 --> 53:34.278
Fuck yeah.

53:34.380 --> 53:35.817
Let's go.
- Yes!

53:35.919 --> 53:36.881
Ooh!

53:37.824 --> 53:39.056
Don't worry about that.

53:39.158 --> 53:40.918
There's gonna be
some drunk-ass ants.

53:45.198 --> 53:46.489
- I mean, if you
want to get the job,

53:46.591 --> 53:48.298
you gotta do the bullshit.

53:48.400 --> 53:50.194
And that goes for everything,
not just politics.

53:50.296 --> 53:52.332
You'll see.

53:52.434 --> 53:54.734
You sound like
a bitter old man.

53:54.836 --> 53:59.143
There's a
reason people get that way.

53:59.245 --> 54:04.915
I mean, if I knew
then what I know now--

54:05.017 --> 54:07.815
Oh, I'm-- I'm good, thank you.

54:07.917 --> 54:08.882
Oh, OK.

54:08.985 --> 54:09.881
All right.

54:14.859 --> 54:16.022
No thanks.

54:16.124 --> 54:18.792
Makes me dizzy.

54:18.894 --> 54:21.094
OK.

54:25.067 --> 54:26.295
Jack Lambert!

54:26.398 --> 54:27.770
Fuck yeah!

54:27.872 --> 54:28.798
Yep, thank you.

54:28.900 --> 54:33.041
Oh my god, why did
you let me do that?

54:33.143 --> 54:35.010
I'm not the boss of you.

54:35.112 --> 54:37.781
That's your wife's job.

54:37.883 --> 54:40.978
Hey, words hurt.

54:41.080 --> 54:43.819
You know what you were
telling me a few months ago?

54:43.921 --> 54:46.250
No, I do not.

54:46.352 --> 54:48.355
That's weird.

54:48.457 --> 54:50.554
You were saying,
Elise, I never

54:50.656 --> 54:53.522
want to lie about who I am.

54:53.624 --> 54:55.027
I never said that.

54:55.130 --> 54:57.765
You did.

54:57.867 --> 55:01.503
you said your parents lied to
each other about who they were,

55:01.605 --> 55:06.008
and that's why they were
so miserable and split up.

55:06.110 --> 55:08.404
It was so clear to you.

55:08.506 --> 55:09.608
You know what?

55:09.710 --> 55:11.508
Actually, I do
remember saying that.

55:11.610 --> 55:13.543
We were driving around.

55:13.645 --> 55:14.811
What do you want to do?

55:14.913 --> 55:16.379
I don't know, what
do you want to do?

55:16.481 --> 55:17.415
I don't know.

55:17.517 --> 55:19.449
Forever, just all night.

55:19.551 --> 55:21.857
Driving, talking.

55:21.959 --> 55:22.888
Nothing to do.

55:25.795 --> 55:28.465
Now there's
always something to do.

55:31.563 --> 55:33.633
You said to me--

55:33.735 --> 55:37.271
I remember you said,
"You can try to be what

55:37.373 --> 55:39.871
other people want you to be.

55:39.973 --> 55:43.040
But if you lie about who
you are, it won't matter."

55:47.483 --> 55:49.484
Well, you know,
I was saying all

55:49.586 --> 55:51.186
that because I wanted
to grow my hair long

55:51.288 --> 55:52.516
and my dad wouldn't let me.

55:52.618 --> 55:53.858
Yeah, you should have.

55:53.960 --> 55:54.818
Oh, are you kidding?

55:54.920 --> 55:56.559
As soon as I got
to college, fwoomp.

55:59.098 --> 56:00.224
You must have looked pretty.

56:00.326 --> 56:01.161
Pretty?

56:01.263 --> 56:03.930
I looked gorgeous.

56:04.032 --> 56:08.203
I had this huge mane of hair
that would flow in the wind

56:08.305 --> 56:11.005
as I rode my bike down the quad.

56:11.107 --> 56:12.576
It was great.

56:12.678 --> 56:15.474
And I'd sit in my dorm room at
night in front of the mirror

56:15.576 --> 56:18.074
and brush it, like, 100 times.

56:18.176 --> 56:20.845
You see, I had the time
to do those kind of things

56:20.948 --> 56:22.946
because when you look
like you just escaped

56:23.048 --> 56:24.714
from medieval prison,
you don't get a lot

56:24.816 --> 56:28.289
of dates, strangely enough.

56:28.391 --> 56:31.695
I'm sure you did just fine.

56:31.797 --> 56:33.891
Yeah.

56:33.993 --> 56:37.397
You know, the thing I
said out on the lake

56:37.499 --> 56:39.030
about it taking only a year?

56:43.373 --> 56:51.614
Well, college was, uh, only.

56:55.349 --> 56:56.149
- Guys.

56:56.251 --> 56:59.151
Oh, yes, pot.

56:59.254 --> 57:00.183
It's time.

57:05.294 --> 57:09.830
- 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

57:16.007 --> 57:17.036
What is that?

57:17.138 --> 57:18.808
Hm?

57:18.911 --> 57:21.705
Oh, right.

57:21.807 --> 57:26.311
This is how we do fireworks now.

57:26.413 --> 57:28.748
It's beautiful.

57:28.851 --> 57:31.916
It's actually an
artificial meteor shower.

57:32.019 --> 57:33.584
There's a satellite up
there that just shoots

57:33.686 --> 57:35.985
stuff into the atmosphere.

57:36.087 --> 57:38.193
Coolest part is
that it's so quiet.

57:38.295 --> 57:41.865
Well, right now it isn't.

57:41.967 --> 57:43.628
Right, sorry.

57:43.730 --> 57:49.133
It is beautiful.

58:08.126 --> 58:10.860
You want to walk?

58:10.962 --> 58:12.259
Yeah.

58:12.361 --> 58:13.795
Yeah, let's do it.

58:20.165 --> 58:23.206
Forgot about that part
where you stand up.

58:23.308 --> 58:27.070
- It's weird.

58:27.172 --> 58:28.811
I've only been back
for a little while,

58:28.913 --> 58:31.874
but I've managed to meet up
with some of my old friends,

58:31.977 --> 58:35.182
and they all say
the same things.

58:35.284 --> 58:36.414
You'll see.

58:36.516 --> 58:37.315
You'll learn.

58:37.418 --> 58:40.483
It's sad.

58:40.585 --> 58:42.754
Sad?

58:42.856 --> 58:45.596
Everyone looks
tired, distracted.

58:45.698 --> 58:49.760
Like they had a dream and
they lost it, even if they

58:49.862 --> 58:52.028
never really had one to lose.

58:52.130 --> 58:56.206
Well, Elise,
people have children.

58:56.308 --> 58:58.238
They have responsibilities.

58:58.340 --> 58:59.938
It's not that.

59:00.040 --> 59:06.714
They just seem content
to be disappointed.

59:06.817 --> 59:10.485
Well, as you get older,
disappointments add up

59:10.587 --> 59:13.488
and you start to
expect more of it.

59:13.590 --> 59:15.623
Yeah, but don't
you wish you would

59:15.725 --> 59:16.888
have kept that
excitement for life

59:16.990 --> 59:20.060
that you had when
you were younger?

59:20.162 --> 59:22.927
It's easier to be excited
when it's all in front of you.

59:23.029 --> 59:24.666
You should be
even more passionate

59:24.768 --> 59:27.835
about life because
there's less of it left.

59:27.937 --> 59:29.670
Just like the rest of
them, you used to be cool.

59:29.772 --> 59:32.841
And now you're all
boring and jaded.

59:35.942 --> 59:37.280
Elise, I don't
mean to be mean,

59:37.382 --> 59:39.312
but you hardly know me now.

59:39.414 --> 59:42.483
I know you.

59:42.586 --> 59:44.147
I can see what's
missing, anyway.

59:44.249 --> 59:46.450
When's the last time
you really laughed?

59:46.553 --> 59:47.519
Tonight.

59:47.621 --> 59:48.722
And before that?

59:48.824 --> 59:50.092
I don't know, I
laugh all the time.

59:50.194 --> 59:52.227
I love comedy.

59:52.329 --> 59:53.329
"I love comedy."

59:53.431 --> 59:54.825
What a stupid thing to say.

59:54.927 --> 59:57.094
Like that makes you unique.

59:57.197 --> 59:58.762
Like there are people
running around all over.

59:58.864 --> 1:00:00.566
"Stop all this comedy.

1:00:00.668 --> 1:00:01.933
I don't like it one bit."

1:00:02.035 --> 1:00:03.841
Well, you'd be
surprised about that.

1:00:03.943 --> 1:00:05.904
Stop.

1:00:06.006 --> 1:00:07.673
Stop talking to me
like I'm this naive

1:00:07.775 --> 1:00:09.106
kid who doesn't know anything.

1:00:09.209 --> 1:00:10.773
Well, I'm a lot older
than you know, Elise.

1:00:10.875 --> 1:00:13.843
Well, I don't care!

1:00:13.945 --> 1:00:15.045
Your age doesn't matter.

1:00:15.147 --> 1:00:17.413
I only care if you're
you or not you.

1:00:46.011 --> 1:00:47.377
I didn't mean to upset you.

1:00:53.324 --> 1:00:56.458
I missed 20 years.

1:00:56.560 --> 1:00:59.997
I'll never get that time back.

1:01:00.099 --> 1:01:01.762
You're 18.

1:01:01.864 --> 1:01:04.399
You got your whole
life ahead of you.

1:01:04.501 --> 1:01:05.736
That's not what I meant.

1:01:08.265 --> 1:01:09.636
Everybody talks
about me like I'm

1:01:09.738 --> 1:01:12.542
this teenager trapped in time.

1:01:12.644 --> 1:01:19.114
But really, I feel
like an old lady.

1:01:19.216 --> 1:01:21.550
How so?

1:01:21.652 --> 1:01:23.119
You'll probably
think it's silly.

1:01:23.221 --> 1:01:24.020
No, I won't.

1:01:24.122 --> 1:01:26.249
Tell me.

1:01:26.351 --> 1:01:31.360
I don't know who
the latest bands are.

1:01:31.462 --> 1:01:33.024
Most things are confusing.

1:01:33.126 --> 1:01:37.699
I mean, an artificial
meteor shower?

1:01:37.801 --> 1:01:38.896
If you hadn't been
here, I would have

1:01:38.998 --> 1:01:42.072
thought we were under attack.

1:01:42.174 --> 1:01:43.139
You'll learn.

1:01:43.241 --> 1:01:44.170
You'll catch up.

1:01:48.439 --> 1:01:52.349
You got to see things
change, bit by bit.

1:01:52.451 --> 1:01:57.220
But for me, everything-- poof.

1:01:57.322 --> 1:01:58.347
Totally different.

1:01:58.449 --> 1:02:02.259
I can't relate to
people my age because we

1:02:02.361 --> 1:02:05.158
have nothing in common.

1:02:05.260 --> 1:02:07.495
I can't relate to people I
used to know because they

1:02:07.597 --> 1:02:08.799
all think I'm a child.

1:02:11.732 --> 1:02:12.968
It's so confusing.

1:02:16.141 --> 1:02:17.569
Elise.

1:02:17.671 --> 1:02:19.738
And so much--

1:02:19.840 --> 1:02:21.376
so much looks the same.

1:02:21.478 --> 1:02:25.212
The town, the lake.

1:02:25.314 --> 1:02:29.479
My memories of everything are
so vivid that even a storefront

1:02:29.581 --> 1:02:36.118
that's changed color or a
street that's been renamed

1:02:36.220 --> 1:02:37.828
remind me that I'm out of place.

1:02:43.599 --> 1:02:47.070
Then there's my dad.

1:02:47.173 --> 1:02:49.106
He's sick.

1:02:49.208 --> 1:02:50.068
Really sick.

1:02:50.170 --> 1:02:53.209
And he's not taking
care of himself.

1:02:53.311 --> 1:02:54.207
It's all on me.

1:02:57.911 --> 1:03:00.678
Nothing is like it was.

1:03:00.780 --> 1:03:01.885
I'm so sorry.

1:03:05.383 --> 1:03:07.090
It's not your
fault you got older.

1:03:07.193 --> 1:03:08.122
I get it.

1:03:10.220 --> 1:03:11.928
It's just hard sometimes.

1:03:14.966 --> 1:03:18.027
I didn't realize how much
everything would change,

1:03:18.129 --> 1:03:22.037
and how little I'd fit in.

1:03:31.043 --> 1:03:33.475
Not everything's changed.

1:03:33.578 --> 1:03:37.554
All these years, this
has been my lucky coin.

1:03:37.656 --> 1:03:38.916
Never even told
anybody about it.

1:03:39.018 --> 1:03:40.418
I just kept it close.

1:03:42.988 --> 1:03:44.422
Through everything.

1:04:07.517 --> 1:04:10.450
I love you.

1:04:10.552 --> 1:04:11.482
God.

1:04:14.325 --> 1:04:14.917
I can't.

1:04:15.019 --> 1:04:16.724
I can't do this.

1:04:16.826 --> 1:04:18.260
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

1:04:18.363 --> 1:04:19.256
I'm sorry.

1:04:19.358 --> 1:04:21.891
I'm drunk, and I'm
stoned, and I'm--

1:04:21.993 --> 1:04:23.397
I'm way too old.

1:04:23.499 --> 1:04:25.268
I'm 18.

1:04:25.370 --> 1:04:25.961
Can't do this.

1:04:26.063 --> 1:04:26.898
I'm married.

1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:28.130
We can never do this.

1:04:28.232 --> 1:04:29.635
I-- I just have to go.

1:04:29.737 --> 1:04:30.908
I have to go.

1:04:50.823 --> 1:04:52.857
Hey.

1:04:52.959 --> 1:04:55.891
Just going to bed.

1:04:55.994 --> 1:04:57.764
Hey, hey.

1:04:57.866 --> 1:04:58.829
Everything all right?

1:04:58.931 --> 1:05:00.501
Yeah, I'm fine.

1:05:00.603 --> 1:05:02.404
I'm just tired.

1:05:02.506 --> 1:05:03.371
Goodnight, Dad.

1:05:03.473 --> 1:05:04.403
Night.

1:05:46.278 --> 1:05:50.484
I smell booze.

1:05:50.586 --> 1:05:51.516
Shh.

1:05:55.427 --> 1:05:56.326
I'm ovulating.

1:05:56.428 --> 1:05:57.324
I don't care.

1:06:13.304 --> 1:06:14.440
- Stay on message.

1:06:17.779 --> 1:06:19.679
Thank you.

1:06:24.419 --> 1:06:26.450
- And we're back
with guest Jack Lambert,

1:06:26.553 --> 1:06:29.626
former Congressman and
recent Senate candidate,

1:06:29.728 --> 1:06:32.323
known for his unique passion.

1:06:32.425 --> 1:06:33.856
Thank you for joining
us, Congressman.

1:06:33.958 --> 1:06:36.726
Well, thank you, Karen, for
putting that so delicately.

1:06:36.828 --> 1:06:39.361
But I think everyone knows
what you're referring to.

1:06:39.463 --> 1:06:40.929
- The swearing incident.

1:06:41.031 --> 1:06:43.700
A lot of folks are saying that's
what cost you the election.

1:06:43.802 --> 1:06:46.371
It looked like it was all
yours just the week before.

1:06:46.473 --> 1:06:47.875
Well, I think the
election went the way

1:06:47.977 --> 1:06:49.073
it did for a number of reasons.

1:06:49.175 --> 1:06:51.541
But yes, it had an impact.

1:06:51.643 --> 1:06:54.178
And I'll just say
now what I said then.

1:06:54.280 --> 1:06:56.150
What I did was inappropriate.

1:06:56.252 --> 1:06:58.685
And I'm truly sorry
to those I offended.

1:06:58.787 --> 1:06:59.719
You're sorry?

1:06:59.821 --> 1:07:01.220
Absolutely.

1:07:01.322 --> 1:07:04.194
It was out of character
for me, Karen.

1:07:04.296 --> 1:07:06.357
But I can assure you it came
from a place of true passion

1:07:06.459 --> 1:07:08.164
for education and
children's issues.

1:07:08.266 --> 1:07:10.428
See, my wife Maggie and I,
like so many other people

1:07:10.530 --> 1:07:12.031
across our great state,
are trying to start

1:07:12.133 --> 1:07:13.763
a family of our own right now.

1:07:13.865 --> 1:07:16.639
And we want to be sure we
provide the Absolute best

1:07:16.741 --> 1:07:18.533
for every child's future.

1:07:18.635 --> 1:07:19.874
And that's what
we wanted to talk

1:07:19.976 --> 1:07:22.374
about in this interview, but--

1:07:22.477 --> 1:07:24.879
well, let me just show
you this footage that's

1:07:24.981 --> 1:07:26.509
been making the rounds today.

1:07:26.611 --> 1:07:29.018
This is a video
shot by an attendee

1:07:29.120 --> 1:07:32.882
of an out-of-control
party just last night.

1:07:32.984 --> 1:07:35.792
Would you care to explain to our
viewers what we're seeing here?

1:07:38.990 --> 1:07:40.456
Uh.

1:07:40.558 --> 1:07:46.532
Well, that's--
We're on vacation.

1:07:46.634 --> 1:07:48.870
- You don't seem too
sorry about your behavior

1:07:48.972 --> 1:07:50.405
in that video, Mr. Lambert.

1:07:50.507 --> 1:07:53.441
And many are saying you now
intend to run for governor.

1:07:53.543 --> 1:07:57.005
Is this the kind of loose
cannon candidate we can expect?

1:07:57.107 --> 1:08:00.311
No, I haven't declared yet,
and that's all out of context.

1:08:00.413 --> 1:08:02.345
So you admit you
are considering

1:08:02.447 --> 1:08:04.319
a run in spite of these antics?

1:08:11.827 --> 1:08:13.228
Yes, Karen.

1:08:13.330 --> 1:08:16.699
I'm definitely considering
a run for governor.

1:08:16.801 --> 1:08:18.068
But tell me something.

1:08:18.170 --> 1:08:20.968
Is this really news
you're covering right now?

1:08:21.070 --> 1:08:23.833
Man on vacation goes to party?

1:08:23.935 --> 1:08:27.073
The kids in that video are
having fun at my expense.

1:08:27.175 --> 1:08:28.510
I was having fun with them.

1:08:28.612 --> 1:08:29.806
So what?

1:08:29.908 --> 1:08:32.616
None of it has to do with my
qualifications for office.

1:08:32.718 --> 1:08:34.081
Well, some say it does.

1:08:34.183 --> 1:08:36.880
And who are those
people, Karen?

1:08:36.982 --> 1:08:40.189
The pundits who do the rounds
on circus shows like this?

1:08:40.291 --> 1:08:41.951
Well, I don't think
that's a fair assessment.

1:08:42.053 --> 1:08:44.452
But judging a person's worth
on a snippet of video is fair?

1:08:44.554 --> 1:08:46.021
Well, if it's relevant--

1:08:46.123 --> 1:08:48.823
Let me lay it out there for
you and the rest of the media

1:08:48.926 --> 1:08:52.400
so you can stop wasting
time reporting on it.

1:08:54.871 --> 1:08:57.140
I'm a human being.

1:08:57.242 --> 1:09:00.375
I use bad language when I
get worked up sometimes.

1:09:00.477 --> 1:09:02.844
Like most people, I can get
caught up in the moment.

1:09:02.946 --> 1:09:04.446
Is that such a bad thing?

1:09:04.548 --> 1:09:07.179
Now, you asked me what kind
of candidate you can expect.

1:09:07.281 --> 1:09:09.747
I say, expect a human being.

1:09:09.849 --> 1:09:12.054
If you want passionless
perfection, do what Norway did

1:09:12.156 --> 1:09:13.719
and elect an artificial
intelligence.

1:09:13.821 --> 1:09:14.950
OK.

1:09:15.052 --> 1:09:16.620
- I believe in an
America that excels because

1:09:16.722 --> 1:09:19.124
of the passion and
humanity of its people

1:09:19.226 --> 1:09:21.495
and its representatives.

1:09:21.597 --> 1:09:24.132
When you start holding
politicians to a standard so

1:09:24.234 --> 1:09:26.661
ridiculous that
they become robots,

1:09:26.763 --> 1:09:28.170
people will go the
other direction

1:09:28.272 --> 1:09:29.972
and elect the biggest
idiot they can find.

1:09:30.074 --> 1:09:33.341
So I'm done lying
about who I am.

1:09:33.443 --> 1:09:35.641
I think it's time for more
honesty in this world.

1:09:37.913 --> 1:09:38.809
Thank you.

1:09:41.045 --> 1:09:45.454
Oh, and for the sake of
honesty, I'm hung over his shit.

1:09:45.556 --> 1:09:50.026
- Strong words from loose
cannon candidate Jack Lambert.

1:09:50.128 --> 1:09:51.822
Looks like he went
a little off script,

1:09:51.924 --> 1:09:54.792
and it all happened right
here on Karen Keeley Live.

1:10:00.100 --> 1:10:01.571
What was that?

1:10:01.673 --> 1:10:02.599
- I just--

1:10:02.701 --> 1:10:04.407
What happened to
staying on message?

1:10:04.509 --> 1:10:07.175
All the work we've done, and you
just throw it away like that?

1:10:07.277 --> 1:10:08.944
I didn't want to
do this interview.

1:10:09.046 --> 1:10:10.439
You guys pushed me into it.

1:10:10.541 --> 1:10:12.542
Oh, I'm so sorry, Jack.

1:10:12.644 --> 1:10:14.080
I'm sorry you had
to do something

1:10:14.182 --> 1:10:15.985
you didn't want to do.

1:10:16.087 --> 1:10:17.212
You sound like a
fucking teenager.

1:10:17.314 --> 1:10:18.350
Maggie!

1:10:18.452 --> 1:10:19.917
What the hell was
that video, huh?

1:10:20.019 --> 1:10:23.223
That's what you were doing last
night while I was sleeping?

1:10:23.325 --> 1:10:24.793
Sneaking out with
your girlfriend?

1:10:24.895 --> 1:10:26.395
It's not like that.

1:10:30.297 --> 1:10:32.530
You're so fucking cliche.

1:10:32.632 --> 1:10:34.904
Middle-age guy suddenly
decides he needs

1:10:35.006 --> 1:10:38.338
to screw a girl half his age.

1:10:38.440 --> 1:10:40.875
Oh, do you feel
like a big man now?

1:10:40.977 --> 1:10:42.342
Nothing happened.

1:10:42.444 --> 1:10:46.178
You were thinking
about her, though.

1:10:46.280 --> 1:10:47.615
Last night.
- What?

1:10:47.717 --> 1:10:48.550
No.

1:10:48.652 --> 1:10:50.787
I--

1:10:50.889 --> 1:10:51.981
I'm not an idiot, Jack.

1:11:01.594 --> 1:11:05.066
Long time ago, I
asked you why you

1:11:05.168 --> 1:11:06.930
carry that stupid coin around.

1:11:09.440 --> 1:11:12.805
And you told me it was
just a good luck charm.

1:11:12.907 --> 1:11:17.873
Do you have any idea what it
was like to sit next to you

1:11:17.975 --> 1:11:20.812
at that dinner and hear
her tell that story?

1:11:23.252 --> 1:11:24.651
To know that all these years--

1:11:27.792 --> 1:11:28.688
all these years.

1:11:33.795 --> 1:11:36.996
And to have to watch you
make doe eyes at this child.

1:11:37.098 --> 1:11:38.099
Hey, hold on.

1:11:38.201 --> 1:11:42.304
It's not a normal situation.

1:11:42.406 --> 1:11:45.575
I know that I'm not
everything you wanted.

1:11:45.677 --> 1:11:46.304
Maggie.

1:11:46.406 --> 1:11:47.438
I'm not spontaneous.

1:11:47.540 --> 1:11:51.541
I'm not-- I'm not carefree.

1:11:51.644 --> 1:11:53.647
But I have built
a life with you.

1:11:56.015 --> 1:12:00.286
I have tried so hard to be
everything that you needed.

1:12:00.388 --> 1:12:02.491
And I know I push you sometimes.

1:12:04.725 --> 1:12:08.060
All I ever wanted was
for you to love me.

1:12:08.162 --> 1:12:09.259
I do, Maggie.

1:12:09.361 --> 1:12:12.532
I do love you.

1:12:12.634 --> 1:12:18.875
I just-- just needed
to go out for a night.

1:12:18.977 --> 1:12:21.336
I just needed a break.

1:12:21.439 --> 1:12:22.237
From me.

1:12:22.339 --> 1:12:23.172
No.

1:12:23.274 --> 1:12:25.310
No.

1:12:25.412 --> 1:12:27.912
Just from everything.

1:12:31.484 --> 1:12:33.284
Get the fuck out of here.

1:12:33.386 --> 1:12:34.218
Maggie, come on.

1:12:34.320 --> 1:12:35.152
Please, Jack.

1:12:35.254 --> 1:12:37.857
Just go.

1:12:37.959 --> 1:12:38.890
Go.

1:12:59.113 --> 1:12:59.949
Oof.

1:13:00.051 --> 1:13:02.012
You look like shit, man.

1:13:02.114 --> 1:13:04.019
I'm telling you, a little
rum and Coke in the morning

1:13:04.121 --> 1:13:05.084
always does the trick.

1:13:05.186 --> 1:13:06.082
Look at me.

1:13:08.356 --> 1:13:10.385
Let's get that drink now.

1:13:10.487 --> 1:13:11.593
Sure.

1:13:15.493 --> 1:13:16.293
Oh shit, man.

1:13:16.395 --> 1:13:17.533
You gonna cry?

1:13:20.270 --> 1:13:22.305
Don't you cry in my truck, Jack.

1:13:22.407 --> 1:13:23.907
You know how hard it
is to get the smell

1:13:24.009 --> 1:13:26.634
of tears out of leather?

1:13:26.736 --> 1:13:30.242
Oh my god, it lives.

1:13:30.344 --> 1:13:32.541
I screwed up, man.

1:13:32.643 --> 1:13:35.751
Really screwed up.

1:13:35.853 --> 1:13:37.953
I know.

1:13:38.055 --> 1:13:39.049
I walked Elise home.

1:13:41.689 --> 1:13:44.488
Don't you say I
didn't tell you, man.

1:13:44.590 --> 1:13:47.163
Should've left it alone.

1:13:47.265 --> 1:13:49.960
The past is behind
you, you know?

1:13:50.062 --> 1:13:54.030
You try to relive it,
it's never gonna work out.

1:13:54.132 --> 1:13:57.970
You're a real fucking
instigator, you know that?

1:13:58.072 --> 1:14:00.001
If you feel that way, why did
you come get me last night?

1:14:00.103 --> 1:14:02.545
Well, forgive me
for wanting to spend

1:14:02.647 --> 1:14:07.042
some time with an old
friend I never see anymore.

1:14:07.144 --> 1:14:11.285
I thought I had myself
convinced, you know?

1:14:11.387 --> 1:14:12.283
That it was an infatuation.

1:14:12.385 --> 1:14:14.021
It's puppy love.

1:14:14.123 --> 1:14:15.286
I've grown up.

1:14:15.388 --> 1:14:17.355
I've changed.

1:14:17.457 --> 1:14:18.257
And I have changed.

1:14:18.359 --> 1:14:20.524
I've changed a lot.

1:14:20.626 --> 1:14:21.993
But I still love her, man.

1:14:27.367 --> 1:14:28.538
What the fuck.

1:14:32.705 --> 1:14:33.906
Hey, pull over for a second.

1:14:49.424 --> 1:14:51.653
It's the same bad movie.

1:14:51.755 --> 1:14:52.823
You wanna see it?

1:14:52.925 --> 1:14:54.162
Nah, something
tells me it doesn't

1:14:54.264 --> 1:14:55.690
hold up to the original.

1:14:55.792 --> 1:14:57.792
Nothing ever does.

1:14:57.894 --> 1:14:59.131
Let's go get that drink.

1:14:59.233 --> 1:15:00.130
Yeah.

1:15:11.214 --> 1:15:12.142
You're kidding me.

1:15:15.185 --> 1:15:16.512
You're kidding me!

1:15:19.755 --> 1:15:21.286
Roger, I'm gonna have
to call you back.

1:15:21.388 --> 1:15:24.190
Five minutes.

1:15:24.292 --> 1:15:26.323
- Hello?

1:15:26.426 --> 1:15:27.393
Hi there.

1:15:27.495 --> 1:15:28.731
What can I do for you?

1:15:28.833 --> 1:15:29.561
Hi.

1:15:29.663 --> 1:15:31.334
I was just looking for my dad.

1:15:31.436 --> 1:15:33.366
Oh, that's who
you're looking for?

1:15:33.468 --> 1:15:34.368
I thought that maybe he--

1:15:34.470 --> 1:15:35.567
I think I saw him out back.

1:15:35.669 --> 1:15:36.899
Come on, I'll walk you there.

1:15:37.001 --> 1:15:38.171
Oh, I don't want
to bother you.

1:15:38.273 --> 1:15:39.202
No, I insist.

1:15:46.146 --> 1:15:53.381
You know, I didn't really
get it at first, this place.

1:15:53.850 --> 1:15:56.222
More of a city girl.

1:15:56.324 --> 1:15:57.753
I love New York.

1:15:57.855 --> 1:16:00.227
Don't you love New York?

1:16:00.329 --> 1:16:01.296
I've never been.

1:16:01.399 --> 1:16:03.131
That's
right, I forgot.

1:16:03.233 --> 1:16:04.860
Well, you should go.

1:16:04.962 --> 1:16:06.935
You should go somewhere, anyway.

1:16:07.037 --> 1:16:07.864
Travel.

1:16:07.966 --> 1:16:09.498
That's what you
want to do, right?

1:16:09.600 --> 1:16:10.399
Yeah.

1:16:10.501 --> 1:16:11.738
Hm.

1:16:11.841 --> 1:16:13.769
Unfortunately, we are
going to be traveling

1:16:13.871 --> 1:16:15.511
sooner than we thought.

1:16:15.613 --> 1:16:18.777
Things are heating up
for Jack back home.

1:16:18.879 --> 1:16:21.847
I'm genuinely gonna
miss this place.

1:16:21.949 --> 1:16:26.188
Whoever buys it is
going to be very lucky.

1:16:26.290 --> 1:16:28.353
You're selling the house?

1:16:28.455 --> 1:16:29.753
Of course.

1:16:29.855 --> 1:16:32.325
That's why we're fixing it up.

1:16:32.427 --> 1:16:34.194
I just thought--

1:16:34.296 --> 1:16:35.392
to make it nice.

1:16:35.494 --> 1:16:36.328
Right.

1:16:36.430 --> 1:16:38.798
So it sells.

1:16:38.900 --> 1:16:41.635
I guess I thought Jack
would have told you.

1:16:41.737 --> 1:16:44.633
You were with him
last night, right?

1:16:44.735 --> 1:16:46.074
With Patrice.

1:16:46.176 --> 1:16:47.275
Lots of people.

1:16:47.377 --> 1:16:48.742
Thank you, by the way.

1:16:48.844 --> 1:16:51.039
He really needed to
blow off some steam.

1:16:51.141 --> 1:16:54.143
Lord knows I can
be kind of a drag.

1:16:54.245 --> 1:16:56.685
The last couple of years
have been stressful.

1:16:56.787 --> 1:17:00.049
The campaign can really
wear on our relationship.

1:17:00.151 --> 1:17:04.225
Last night, Jack was
like a kid again.

1:17:04.327 --> 1:17:06.129
Couldn't get enough.

1:17:06.231 --> 1:17:07.628
I really needed it too.

1:17:07.730 --> 1:17:09.463
When are you trying
for a baby, things

1:17:09.565 --> 1:17:12.231
can get a little mechanical.

1:17:12.334 --> 1:17:13.434
Who knows?

1:17:13.536 --> 1:17:16.238
Maybe last night was the night.

1:17:16.340 --> 1:17:18.207
So thank you for that.

1:17:18.309 --> 1:17:20.205
I'll leave you to it.

1:17:20.307 --> 1:17:21.339
Oh.

1:17:21.441 --> 1:17:22.376
This?

1:17:22.478 --> 1:17:24.447
It's much, much better.

1:17:24.549 --> 1:17:25.880
He can't tell you're
trying at all.

1:17:31.255 --> 1:17:31.980
Have you seen Hank?

1:17:32.082 --> 1:17:33.784
Uh, Patrice let him go early.

1:17:33.886 --> 1:17:35.021
He wasn't looking too good.

1:17:49.967 --> 1:17:52.934
It'll all blow over, man

1:17:53.036 --> 1:17:54.840
You don't know Maggie.

1:17:54.942 --> 1:17:57.143
Even if we make up,
in 15 years, she's

1:17:57.245 --> 1:18:00.115
going to make some crack. oh,
an antique gumball machine.

1:18:00.217 --> 1:18:01.049
Have any coins?

1:18:05.255 --> 1:18:06.087
I love Maggie.

1:18:06.189 --> 1:18:07.450
I do.

1:18:07.552 --> 1:18:12.659
But if I'm being honest, it felt
incredible in that interview

1:18:12.761 --> 1:18:15.290
today to say what
I wanted to say.

1:18:15.392 --> 1:18:18.928
Maggie's-- I always
feel like she's looking

1:18:19.030 --> 1:18:21.564
at me imagining someone else.

1:18:21.666 --> 1:18:22.902
Oof.

1:18:23.005 --> 1:18:26.135
I mean, that's-- that's
kind of messed up, man.

1:18:26.237 --> 1:18:27.541
Look, I know-- I
know I've been giving

1:18:27.643 --> 1:18:29.076
you a hard time and all that.

1:18:29.178 --> 1:18:32.912
But look, if you want to be
with Elise, just do it, man.

1:18:33.015 --> 1:18:35.043
Who cares you look like
some creepy old dude?

1:18:35.145 --> 1:18:36.684
You can't worry about that shit.

1:18:36.786 --> 1:18:39.349
I'm not worried
about that, thank you.

1:18:42.186 --> 1:18:43.392
When Elise and I
were dating, she

1:18:43.494 --> 1:18:46.028
would write me these letters.

1:18:46.131 --> 1:18:46.963
Longhand.

1:18:47.065 --> 1:18:48.059
Ooh.

1:18:48.161 --> 1:18:49.123
Yeah, that's why I
never told you about it,

1:18:49.225 --> 1:18:50.296
because you'd make fun of me.

1:18:50.398 --> 1:18:52.362
Well.

1:18:52.464 --> 1:18:56.397
She'd slip one in my
pocket when we were together.

1:18:56.499 --> 1:18:59.804
I wasn't supposed to
read it till I got home.

1:18:59.906 --> 1:19:01.570
Made saying goodbye easier.

1:19:01.672 --> 1:19:05.643
It was always about the stuff
we were going to do next time we

1:19:05.745 --> 1:19:07.110
hung out, you know?

1:19:07.212 --> 1:19:09.679
Dumb stuff we were
never going to do.

1:19:09.781 --> 1:19:12.519
Robbing banks.

1:19:12.621 --> 1:19:13.884
Joining a dance crew.

1:19:13.986 --> 1:19:16.288
Well, you might do that one.

1:19:16.390 --> 1:19:21.597
After she was gone, I took all
the letters and I burned them.

1:19:21.699 --> 1:19:25.230
I had a little funeral
in the backyard

1:19:25.332 --> 1:19:29.970
because there weren't going
to be any more next times.

1:19:30.072 --> 1:19:34.842
And now, it's like I heard
the beginning of a song,

1:19:34.944 --> 1:19:36.811
and it's been stuck
in my head forever.

1:19:36.913 --> 1:19:39.447
And I-- I just have
to hear the rest of it

1:19:39.549 --> 1:19:40.709
or it'll never go away.

1:19:40.811 --> 1:19:42.014
Wait.

1:19:42.116 --> 1:19:45.584
Are you writing another
damn poem right now?

1:19:45.686 --> 1:19:46.749
Sorry, I'm just--

1:19:46.851 --> 1:19:47.750
No, no, man.

1:19:47.852 --> 1:19:49.152
I get it, man.

1:19:49.254 --> 1:19:51.691
Hey, when I see you,
it's like we pick

1:19:51.793 --> 1:19:53.226
up right where we left off.

1:19:53.328 --> 1:19:56.025
You know, like the last 20
years just went away for a bit.

1:19:56.127 --> 1:19:57.994
You know, I like that feeling.

1:19:58.096 --> 1:20:01.737
But if you commit to Elise?

1:20:01.839 --> 1:20:04.003
it's not picking up
where you left off.

1:20:04.106 --> 1:20:07.973
You gotta blow everything
up and start over.

1:20:08.075 --> 1:20:10.411
I mean, do you
even like politics?

1:20:10.513 --> 1:20:12.610
I used to love it.

1:20:12.712 --> 1:20:13.545
We had fun.

1:20:13.647 --> 1:20:15.816
We were a team.

1:20:15.918 --> 1:20:17.351
And I really want to
help people, I do.

1:20:17.453 --> 1:20:19.281
I'm good at it.

1:20:19.383 --> 1:20:21.089
But somewhere along
the way, it just

1:20:21.191 --> 1:20:23.723
became more about playing a part
and getting to the next level.

1:20:23.826 --> 1:20:26.121
Well, what I'm
saying is, could

1:20:26.223 --> 1:20:29.198
you just walk away from it?

1:20:29.300 --> 1:20:31.961
I don't know.

1:20:32.063 --> 1:20:34.101
I built this whole life.

1:20:34.203 --> 1:20:38.704
And to see how Maggie
looked at me today, I just--

1:20:38.806 --> 1:20:41.908
I can't be that person.

1:20:42.010 --> 1:20:43.378
We've gone through
too much together.

1:20:43.480 --> 1:20:45.979
I can't blow it up.

1:20:46.081 --> 1:20:47.682
It would have been
great to be with Elise,

1:20:47.784 --> 1:20:49.282
but I think we're
both just going

1:20:49.384 --> 1:20:53.085
to have to accept the fact that
that ship has literally sailed.

1:20:53.188 --> 1:20:57.158
I mean, you can still
keep her in your life.

1:20:57.260 --> 1:21:00.422
I don't think that's going
to be good for either of us.

1:21:00.525 --> 1:21:04.026
So this is the end of
the song, right here.

1:21:04.128 --> 1:21:06.333
Don't make fun of me.

1:21:06.436 --> 1:21:07.396
I'm not!

1:21:07.498 --> 1:21:09.968
I mean, you're not
happy right now, man.

1:21:10.070 --> 1:21:11.335
Then what's going
to change, huh?

1:21:11.437 --> 1:21:13.405
Well, I'm going to
apologize for what I did.

1:21:13.507 --> 1:21:14.636
OK.

1:21:14.738 --> 1:21:17.308
But if it's going to go
any further, if that's even

1:21:17.410 --> 1:21:19.911
a possibility at this
point, it has to be based

1:21:20.013 --> 1:21:21.984
on who I was in that interview.

1:21:22.086 --> 1:21:24.882
OK, well, you know, I
hope you can pull that off.

1:21:24.984 --> 1:21:27.387
It's my marriage, man.

1:21:27.489 --> 1:21:29.219
I know.

1:21:29.321 --> 1:21:32.221
But you got to remember,
all else fails,

1:21:32.323 --> 1:21:34.891
there's always the
nuclear option.

1:21:53.549 --> 1:21:54.349
All right.

1:21:54.451 --> 1:21:56.782
Thanks, man.

1:21:56.884 --> 1:21:59.318
I will, uh, let you know.

1:22:04.827 --> 1:22:06.127
Hey, be careful driving home.

1:22:49.669 --> 1:22:50.766
Hi.

1:22:50.868 --> 1:22:52.008
Hi.

1:22:58.549 --> 1:23:00.108
Are you leaving?

1:23:00.210 --> 1:23:01.075
We need to talk.

1:23:01.177 --> 1:23:02.315
No, no, no.

1:23:04.614 --> 1:23:06.849
I gotta-- I gotta
say something first.

1:23:06.951 --> 1:23:08.057
Please.

1:23:10.527 --> 1:23:11.456
I was wrong.

1:23:14.056 --> 1:23:15.629
OK?

1:23:15.731 --> 1:23:16.959
To do what I did.

1:23:17.061 --> 1:23:20.295
The party, and--

1:23:20.397 --> 1:23:23.437
I know how hard you work for me.

1:23:23.539 --> 1:23:25.671
For us.

1:23:25.773 --> 1:23:31.380
And I was wrong.

1:23:31.482 --> 1:23:33.777
Thank you.

1:23:33.880 --> 1:23:35.010
But Jack--

1:23:35.112 --> 1:23:37.111
No-- hold on.

1:23:37.213 --> 1:23:39.753
There's more.

1:23:39.855 --> 1:23:43.754
Did Elise come by today?

1:23:43.857 --> 1:23:44.853
She did.

1:23:44.955 --> 1:23:46.092
OK.

1:23:46.194 --> 1:23:53.434
I don't know what
she said, but I just

1:23:54.337 --> 1:23:58.673
want to say that I am
committed to fix this and get

1:23:58.775 --> 1:24:01.410
back in the game for us.

1:24:01.512 --> 1:24:03.311
I swear it.

1:24:03.413 --> 1:24:05.577
OK.

1:24:05.679 --> 1:24:06.512
OK?

1:24:06.614 --> 1:24:08.449
OK!

1:24:08.551 --> 1:24:09.384
Really?

1:24:09.487 --> 1:24:10.352
That's it?

1:24:10.454 --> 1:24:12.982
Jack.

1:24:13.084 --> 1:24:15.049
You're a hit.

1:24:15.151 --> 1:24:16.953
What?

1:24:17.055 --> 1:24:18.053
The interview.

1:24:18.155 --> 1:24:20.159
It went viral.

1:24:20.261 --> 1:24:22.996
The response is
overwhelmingly positive.

1:24:23.098 --> 1:24:25.332
You just became
the front runner.

1:24:28.903 --> 1:24:29.733
Are you kidding?

1:24:29.835 --> 1:24:31.273
No.

1:24:31.375 --> 1:24:33.805
Roger said they're talking
about you as keynote next year,

1:24:33.907 --> 1:24:35.136
win or lose.

1:24:35.238 --> 1:24:37.075
This is huge.

1:24:37.178 --> 1:24:39.014
We've got to get
back right away.

1:24:39.116 --> 1:24:41.280
Louise is going to
oversee everything here,

1:24:41.383 --> 1:24:45.519
and Roger's booking us
tickets for tomorrow.

1:24:45.621 --> 1:24:46.348
Wait.

1:24:46.450 --> 1:24:48.718
So you're not mad at me anymore?

1:24:53.058 --> 1:24:57.665
I was mad.

1:24:57.767 --> 1:25:00.402
But I've cooled off.

1:25:00.505 --> 1:25:01.401
I get it.

1:25:03.733 --> 1:25:05.405
You're only a
human being, right?

1:25:08.472 --> 1:25:09.904
Gotta put that on a T-shirt.

1:25:46.516 --> 1:25:47.414
Hi.

1:25:58.762 --> 1:26:00.424
I'm leaving today.

1:26:00.526 --> 1:26:05.899
I just-- I just
wanted to say goodbye.

1:26:06.001 --> 1:26:07.762
- Who's out there?

1:26:07.864 --> 1:26:11.270
- Elise, I was
wrong to do what I did.

1:26:11.372 --> 1:26:13.838
I got caught up and
wasn't thinking.

1:26:13.940 --> 1:26:14.776
I know.

1:26:14.878 --> 1:26:15.805
You went home to her.

1:26:20.279 --> 1:26:21.415
I don't know what to say.

1:26:23.987 --> 1:26:26.117
I wish we'd been given a chance.

1:26:26.219 --> 1:26:27.586
What does that mean?

1:26:27.688 --> 1:26:31.390
It means, I wish your father
hadn't decided to leave.

1:26:31.492 --> 1:26:33.327
And I wish my father
hadn't made it happen.

1:26:33.429 --> 1:26:35.996
I wish you'd stayed, and
we'd been given a chance.

1:26:36.098 --> 1:26:37.533
We have been given a chance.

1:26:37.635 --> 1:26:39.197
I came back.

1:26:39.299 --> 1:26:43.934
No, this-- this was random.

1:26:44.037 --> 1:26:45.368
And crazy.

1:26:45.470 --> 1:26:47.937
This wasn't supposed to happen.

1:26:48.039 --> 1:26:50.342
I've had this whole life you
don't know anything about it.

1:26:50.444 --> 1:26:52.342
So you'll have new
things to tell me

1:26:52.444 --> 1:26:55.244
about when we talk all night.

1:26:55.346 --> 1:26:57.653
I don't love you.

1:26:57.755 --> 1:26:58.920
That's not true.

1:26:59.022 --> 1:27:00.783
- And you don't love me.

1:27:00.885 --> 1:27:04.088
You love me from a moment
in time 20 years ago.

1:27:04.190 --> 1:27:06.320
This is real, Jack.

1:27:06.422 --> 1:27:07.557
This is fate.

1:27:07.659 --> 1:27:10.097
I mean, you came
back, and I came here.

1:27:10.199 --> 1:27:11.192
We've been given
a second chance--

1:27:11.294 --> 1:27:12.597
No, no.

1:27:12.699 --> 1:27:14.033
The only chance we've been
given is-- is a chance

1:27:14.135 --> 1:27:15.604
to hurt each other again.

1:27:15.706 --> 1:27:16.399
And I'm sorry.

1:27:16.501 --> 1:27:18.707
I am sorry if I led you on.

1:27:18.809 --> 1:27:21.135
But this isn't fate.

1:27:21.237 --> 1:27:23.174
OK?

1:27:23.276 --> 1:27:24.412
There's no such thing.

1:27:27.380 --> 1:27:28.548
You're right, there isn't.

1:27:31.889 --> 1:27:34.853
I rigged the lottery.

1:27:34.955 --> 1:27:36.920
What?

1:27:37.022 --> 1:27:39.557
When we got to the colonies
and they said they were going

1:27:39.660 --> 1:27:41.422
to send some of us back,
I switched with someone

1:27:41.524 --> 1:27:42.931
who wanted to stay.

1:27:43.033 --> 1:27:44.530
And I knew you would be older.

1:27:44.632 --> 1:27:48.299
But I took the chance
because nothing could stop

1:27:48.401 --> 1:27:50.931
me from coming back to you.

1:27:51.034 --> 1:27:52.534
I mean, if you hadn't
been here, I would have

1:27:52.636 --> 1:27:54.035
found you wherever you were.

1:27:57.007 --> 1:27:59.948
But I see now that I was
thinking like a child.

1:28:00.050 --> 1:28:04.149
So I guess I am growing up.

1:28:04.251 --> 1:28:06.954
Jack, thank you for that.

1:28:07.056 --> 1:28:08.351
Elise, don't--
Don't.

1:28:08.453 --> 1:28:09.119
Hold--
- Let me go.

1:28:09.221 --> 1:28:09.989
Hey, hey, hey!

1:28:10.091 --> 1:28:12.356
I-- Hank, come on.

1:28:12.458 --> 1:28:13.357
I just want to talk to her.

1:28:13.459 --> 1:28:15.664
Slimy son of a...

1:28:15.766 --> 1:28:16.994
- Dad!

1:28:20.501 --> 1:28:22.633
You've brought us
nothing but grief!

1:28:22.735 --> 1:28:25.267
You stay the hell
away from my daughter.

1:28:25.369 --> 1:28:26.507
I'm sorry!

1:28:29.175 --> 1:28:30.104
I'm sorry.

1:28:34.649 --> 1:28:37.686
- I swear I didn't
mean to mess things up.

1:28:37.788 --> 1:28:38.884
It's OK, Dad.

1:28:40.054 --> 1:28:40.950
It's OK.

1:28:51.299 --> 1:28:52.263
Louise, you have the keys?

1:28:52.365 --> 1:28:54.066
Yes.
Safe travels.

1:28:54.168 --> 1:28:54.967
We'll be in touch.

1:28:55.069 --> 1:28:55.902
Thank you.

1:28:56.004 --> 1:28:57.035
Bye, Jack.

1:28:57.137 --> 1:28:58.033
Bye, Louise.

1:29:02.174 --> 1:29:03.104
Hey.

1:29:06.817 --> 1:29:08.144
You coming?

1:29:08.246 --> 1:29:09.385
Yeah.

1:29:50.888 --> 1:29:52.428
ROGER
Listen, buddy,

1:29:52.530 --> 1:29:54.326
I really need you to hit
the section on the subsidies

1:29:54.428 --> 1:29:55.357
for the colony companies, OK?

1:29:55.459 --> 1:29:56.694
- OK, yeah.

1:29:56.797 --> 1:29:58.197
But what happened all
the stuff I had in here

1:29:58.299 --> 1:29:59.298
about children's rights?

1:29:59.400 --> 1:30:00.866
That was the core of my speech!

1:30:00.968 --> 1:30:03.302
Listen, we are seriously in
bed with these guys right now.

1:30:03.404 --> 1:30:04.737
This is not the time for that.

1:30:04.839 --> 1:30:07.073
We need to focus on the
whole romantic space thing.

1:30:07.175 --> 1:30:08.543
Blue collar jobs.

1:30:08.645 --> 1:30:09.871
The fact that your dad was
a pioneer in the industry.

1:30:09.973 --> 1:30:12.145
The same shit that
we've been selling

1:30:12.247 --> 1:30:13.109
for the last six months.

1:30:13.211 --> 1:30:14.515
OK?

1:30:14.617 --> 1:30:16.350
Look, man, you nail this,
the nomination's yours.

1:30:16.452 --> 1:30:17.815
Then we've got the
governor's mansion.

1:30:17.917 --> 1:30:19.615
Maybe in a few years, we
hear the pitter-patter of

1:30:19.717 --> 1:30:20.849
little feet in the White House.

1:30:20.951 --> 1:30:23.188
Still
working on it, Roger.

1:30:23.290 --> 1:30:24.121
- Coffee, Jack?

1:30:24.223 --> 1:30:25.025
No, no.

1:30:25.127 --> 1:30:26.257
Stains the teeth.

1:30:26.359 --> 1:30:28.963
Take I look at this.

1:30:29.065 --> 1:30:30.732
Isn't that adorable?

1:30:30.835 --> 1:30:31.965
So retro.

1:30:32.067 --> 1:30:33.934
You'll love as.

1:30:34.036 --> 1:30:35.269
Heck yeah!

1:30:35.371 --> 1:30:36.569
- Call for
you, Mrs. Lambert.

1:30:36.671 --> 1:30:38.334
ROGER
That's hilarious, right?

1:30:38.436 --> 1:30:39.434
I got one too.

1:30:39.536 --> 1:30:40.368
Check it out.

1:30:40.470 --> 1:30:41.843
Oh, hey.

1:30:41.945 --> 1:30:42.537
Jack, buddy.

1:30:42.639 --> 1:30:43.707
How are you, man?

1:30:43.809 --> 1:30:48.280
Wow, are you
anatomically correct?

1:30:48.382 --> 1:30:50.044
- Heck yeah!

1:30:50.147 --> 1:30:51.678
ROGER I
don't believe you dude.

1:30:51.780 --> 1:30:52.714
That's it.
Show me.

1:30:52.816 --> 1:30:53.822
- Is everything OK?
- Yeah.

1:30:53.924 --> 1:30:54.583
Yeah, I'm fine.

1:30:54.685 --> 1:30:56.751
I just-- I need some air.

1:30:56.853 --> 1:30:58.693
ROGER Come here.

1:30:58.795 --> 1:30:59.553
Wow.

1:31:04.431 --> 1:31:05.901
- There you are.

1:31:06.003 --> 1:31:09.233
I have great news.

1:31:09.335 --> 1:31:10.170
What's this?

1:31:10.272 --> 1:31:11.104
Louise found a buyer.

1:31:11.206 --> 1:31:12.470
Full asking price.

1:31:12.572 --> 1:31:14.569
All you have to do is sign.

1:31:14.671 --> 1:31:16.304
I can't do this.

1:31:16.406 --> 1:31:17.240
Oh.

1:31:17.343 --> 1:31:18.645
I'm sorry.

1:31:18.747 --> 1:31:19.978
Your head's in the speech.
We can do this tomorrow.

1:31:20.080 --> 1:31:20.808
No.

1:31:20.910 --> 1:31:24.018
I mean, I can't do any of this.

1:31:24.120 --> 1:31:25.988
I don't understand.

1:31:26.090 --> 1:31:28.120
All of this is wrong.

1:31:28.222 --> 1:31:29.586
This isn't me.

1:31:29.688 --> 1:31:31.919
I don't want to sell the house.

1:31:32.021 --> 1:31:33.658
I don't want to
make this speech.

1:31:33.760 --> 1:31:36.857
I don't want to hear
the pitter-patter

1:31:36.959 --> 1:31:38.295
of feet in the White House.

1:31:38.397 --> 1:31:39.232
Oh my god.

1:31:39.334 --> 1:31:40.897
Roger was just kidding.

1:31:40.999 --> 1:31:43.168
He's always got his
mind on the next thing.

1:31:43.270 --> 1:31:44.636
Fuck Roger.

1:31:44.738 --> 1:31:46.501
I never even met
that guy in person.

1:31:46.603 --> 1:31:47.735
Is he even real?

1:31:47.837 --> 1:31:48.877
Help me out here, Jack.

1:31:48.979 --> 1:31:49.805
What's going on?

1:31:49.907 --> 1:31:52.406
I don't want to
go back in there.

1:31:52.508 --> 1:31:53.309
OK.

1:31:53.412 --> 1:31:54.412
I get it.

1:31:54.514 --> 1:31:55.380
This is a big moment.

1:31:55.482 --> 1:31:57.084
You don't get it, Maggie.

1:31:57.186 --> 1:31:58.653
Then help me, Jack.

1:31:58.755 --> 1:32:00.853
Because there's a huge crowd
in there waiting for you.

1:32:05.459 --> 1:32:08.028
I thought I wanted this.

1:32:08.130 --> 1:32:09.629
Not like this.

1:32:09.731 --> 1:32:11.331
And I should-- I should
have said something.

1:32:11.433 --> 1:32:13.601
I should have spoken up sooner.

1:32:13.703 --> 1:32:16.334
But ever since we got
back, I've been thinking--

1:32:16.436 --> 1:32:18.036
About that girl?

1:32:18.138 --> 1:32:23.071
We had problems before Elise
even came into the picture.

1:32:23.173 --> 1:32:25.138
We love each other,
Maggie, but come on.

1:32:25.240 --> 1:32:27.248
We're not in love
with each other is--

1:32:27.350 --> 1:32:28.648
I don't know when it happened.

1:32:28.751 --> 1:32:31.448
But whatever we had in
the beginning is gone.

1:32:31.550 --> 1:32:33.619
It's just work now.

1:32:33.721 --> 1:32:37.457
This is just a
business partnership.

1:32:37.559 --> 1:32:38.922
I know I'm not
all things to you.

1:32:39.025 --> 1:32:41.128
Believe me, you're not
all things to me either.

1:32:41.230 --> 1:32:42.830
Not by a long shot.

1:32:42.932 --> 1:32:45.829
Jack, when I was young, I had
different expectations too.

1:32:45.931 --> 1:32:47.696
Why didn't you
get what you wanted?

1:32:47.798 --> 1:32:50.268
We met at the right time.

1:32:50.370 --> 1:32:51.701
We fell in love.

1:32:51.803 --> 1:32:53.800
I understand that things change.

1:32:53.902 --> 1:32:55.076
Some things, yeah.

1:32:55.178 --> 1:32:58.977
But-- well, this?

1:33:05.315 --> 1:33:07.287
It wouldn't be fair to
you to keep pretending

1:33:07.389 --> 1:33:08.382
that I'm someone I'm not.

1:33:14.361 --> 1:33:15.356
This is it?

1:33:17.397 --> 1:33:18.326
Isn't it?

1:33:51.265 --> 1:33:52.295
Yes?

1:33:52.397 --> 1:33:53.334
Hi.

1:33:53.436 --> 1:33:55.734
I was, uh, looking for Elise.

1:33:55.836 --> 1:33:58.202
I'm sorry, there's
no Elise here.

1:33:58.304 --> 1:34:00.740
Oh.

1:34:00.843 --> 1:34:02.505
She used to live here
with her father, Hank.

1:34:02.607 --> 1:34:03.406
- Oh, Hank.

1:34:03.508 --> 1:34:04.473
Yeah.

1:34:04.576 --> 1:34:05.973
Poor guy.

1:34:06.075 --> 1:34:09.812
He passed away a few months ago.

1:34:09.914 --> 1:34:11.885
Oh, I'm sorry, you didn't know?

1:34:14.883 --> 1:34:16.186
No, I didn't.

1:34:18.621 --> 1:34:19.622
OK.

1:34:19.724 --> 1:34:20.993
Well, uh, thank you.

1:34:29.670 --> 1:34:31.334
- She moved on, man.

1:34:31.436 --> 1:34:35.403
Money finally came through and
she moved out to New Orleans.

1:34:40.217 --> 1:34:42.184
I envy you, man.

1:34:42.286 --> 1:34:43.746
Got your own business.

1:34:43.848 --> 1:34:45.952
You're your own boss.

1:34:46.054 --> 1:34:49.353
You somehow manage to stay
free of all the bullshit.

1:34:49.455 --> 1:34:50.552
Free?

1:34:50.654 --> 1:34:52.526
Shit.

1:34:52.628 --> 1:34:55.261
Come on, man, we
all got problems.

1:34:55.363 --> 1:34:56.564
You know that.

1:34:56.666 --> 1:34:57.992
And if we're being
honest, Jack, it's

1:34:58.094 --> 1:34:59.560
just like when we were young.

1:34:59.662 --> 1:35:04.303
You show up, make a big old
mess, and then you just leave.

1:35:04.405 --> 1:35:07.272
You're right.

1:35:07.375 --> 1:35:10.011
I'm sorry.

1:35:10.114 --> 1:35:11.379
It's OK.

1:35:11.481 --> 1:35:12.847
It's what we expect from you.

1:35:16.887 --> 1:35:19.049
Are you gonna tell me
where she is in New Orleans?

1:35:19.151 --> 1:35:21.820
I'll drive
you there tomorrow.

1:35:21.922 --> 1:35:24.256
Oh, you don't have
to do that, man.

1:35:24.359 --> 1:35:25.288
Thank you.

1:35:52.915 --> 1:35:54.053
Over there.

1:35:57.425 --> 1:35:58.555
Good luck.

1:35:58.657 --> 1:35:59.795
Thank you.

1:36:08.767 --> 1:36:09.568
- Thank you.

1:36:09.670 --> 1:36:10.806
Hope to see you again.

1:36:19.775 --> 1:36:20.711
Hey!

1:36:20.813 --> 1:36:22.515
What are you doing here?

1:36:22.617 --> 1:36:24.085
I told you I'd stop by.

1:36:24.187 --> 1:36:25.014
Thanks.

1:36:25.116 --> 1:36:28.585
And I, uh, have
something for you.

1:36:28.687 --> 1:36:29.583
What's this?

1:36:46.906 --> 1:36:49.007
JACK Dear Elise.

1:36:49.109 --> 1:36:51.942
You probably don't
want to see me again,

1:36:52.044 --> 1:36:53.481
but I hope you'll
read these words

1:36:53.583 --> 1:36:56.016
and consider them carefully.

1:36:56.118 --> 1:36:59.348
If I could take back the
things I said to you, I would.

1:36:59.450 --> 1:37:03.452
I was wrong about so
much, and you were right.

1:37:03.554 --> 1:37:07.091
I haven't been honest about
who I am for a long time.

1:37:07.194 --> 1:37:09.027
I wanted to run and tell
you then to convince you

1:37:09.129 --> 1:37:11.565
to be with me again,
but then I realized

1:37:11.667 --> 1:37:14.062
I was right about one thing.

1:37:14.164 --> 1:37:16.196
You need to live your life.

1:37:16.298 --> 1:37:18.303
You can only be young once.

1:37:18.405 --> 1:37:22.376
And it's not fair for me to
show up and take that from you.

1:37:22.478 --> 1:37:24.145
So go out and live.

1:37:24.247 --> 1:37:25.279
Travel.

1:37:25.381 --> 1:37:26.710
Meet people.

1:37:26.812 --> 1:37:28.343
Discover yourself.

1:37:28.446 --> 1:37:30.685
You may think you
already know who you are,

1:37:30.787 --> 1:37:32.652
but I learned it
takes getting a little

1:37:32.754 --> 1:37:36.351
lost to really know for sure.

1:37:36.453 --> 1:37:38.526
I want you to know I've
left it all behind.

1:37:38.628 --> 1:37:42.257
My wife, my career, all of it.

1:37:42.359 --> 1:37:43.865
Just tell them
whatever you have to.

1:37:43.967 --> 1:37:46.230
Listen, Roger-- no, no,
no, I want to talk to you.

1:37:46.332 --> 1:37:48.431
Roger, I need you to
pull some strings for me.

1:37:52.268 --> 1:37:54.736
You sure you want to do this?

1:37:54.839 --> 1:37:55.874
Positive.

1:37:55.976 --> 1:37:57.976
I mean, it's
pretty crazy, man.

1:37:58.078 --> 1:38:02.475
Listen, just make
sure she gets this.

1:38:02.577 --> 1:38:04.378
JACK
I'm going on a trip.

1:38:04.480 --> 1:38:07.715
I'm taking a chance,
just like you did.

1:38:07.817 --> 1:38:13.061
I'm hoping that when something
is true, it stays true forever.

1:38:13.163 --> 1:38:16.898
By the time you read this,
I'll be boarding a colony ship.

1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:21.497
Five years out, five years
back, frozen in time.

1:38:21.599 --> 1:38:24.970
Not as long as your trip,
but it's all I could get.

1:38:25.072 --> 1:38:27.939
And probably as
long as I can wait.

1:38:28.041 --> 1:38:30.140
I don't expect
anything from you.

1:38:30.242 --> 1:38:32.074
You might find
happiness elsewhere.

1:38:32.176 --> 1:38:34.178
Part of me hopes that you do.

1:38:34.280 --> 1:38:38.652
But I want you to
know that I love you.

1:38:38.754 --> 1:38:41.951
I've loved you since I met you.

1:38:42.053 --> 1:38:44.455
I will always love you.

1:38:44.557 --> 1:38:49.129
If I'm lucky and you feel the
same way 10 years from today,

1:38:49.231 --> 1:38:51.263
I'll be waiting for you at
the theater where we met.

1:38:54.397 --> 1:38:57.667
Until then, you'll
be in my dreams.

1:38:57.769 --> 1:38:59.505
Jack.
