WEBVTT

02:08.461 --> 02:09.963
This is beautiful.

02:11.590 --> 02:12.633
-Sam!
-Yeah.

02:12.716 --> 02:13.717
Ready?

02:14.885 --> 02:16.303
Oh, man. This is in rough shape.

02:17.763 --> 02:20.724
Just needs a little love. Come on.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.144
It needs more than a little.

02:27.397 --> 02:28.649
Seventies add-on, huh?

02:30.275 --> 02:32.653
-These are gonna be hard to match.
-What's up?

02:34.738 --> 02:36.657
Hardwood floor's rotted over in spots.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.661
Probably just easier
to carpet over it, right?

02:41.328 --> 02:44.456
Well, our client wants to restore it
to its original glory.

02:45.374 --> 02:46.667
Okay. It's his money.

02:47.709 --> 02:48.919
Where do you wanna start?

02:51.129 --> 02:52.130
No power.

02:52.798 --> 02:55.050
Let's find the breaker.
It's probably in the cellar.

03:02.307 --> 03:04.017
Oh, now this is beautiful.

03:04.560 --> 03:07.437
It's like a time capsule.
Barely been touched.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.399
-Sam?
-Yeah.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.651
Yeah, it's an awesome cellar.

03:14.695 --> 03:15.988
How about that?

03:17.739 --> 03:18.991
What is that?

03:19.783 --> 03:22.244
A barometer. Probably turn of the century.

03:29.418 --> 03:30.794
It's really cool.

03:32.588 --> 03:35.507
Hey, what time do you think we're
gonna be done tonight, by the way?

03:45.017 --> 03:46.518
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

03:46.977 --> 03:49.688
Cheers. Here's to that.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.735
Hi, Francesca?

03:56.737 --> 03:59.072
-Sam?
-Yep. Yep.

03:59.156 --> 04:02.201
I'm sensing from your tone
that if I was another ten minutes,

04:02.284 --> 04:05.287
I'd be asking the bartender if there
was a Francesca here at some point?

04:05.370 --> 04:07.915
-Five more. Tops.
-Fair. So fair.

04:08.290 --> 04:11.084
I'm sorry.
Look, I'm not usually like this.

04:11.168 --> 04:13.504
"Guy who's late." It's my brother's fault.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.757
So, you're "guy who blames his brother"?

04:17.173 --> 04:18.341
Yeah, sometimes.

04:18.425 --> 04:22.012
We work together restoring houses,
and he adopted a baby recently.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.847
He's just been a total tyrant ever since.

04:23.931 --> 04:26.517
I think it's the lack of sleep thing.
It's a real thing.

04:28.310 --> 04:29.311
Boy or girl?

04:29.811 --> 04:30.938
The baby?

04:31.021 --> 04:33.106
Oh, girl. You wanna see a picture of her?

04:33.190 --> 04:35.692
-Yeah.
-Cool. Here, look.

04:36.527 --> 04:38.278
Oh, my gosh. She's so cute.

04:38.362 --> 04:40.155
Right. Isn't she beautiful?
Her name's Alice.

04:40.239 --> 04:42.199
And that's my brother Jake.
That's his husband, Roger.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.283
Super cute family.

04:43.367 --> 04:44.910
-They're the cutest family.
-Yeah.

04:46.328 --> 04:47.913
So, are you a good uncle?

04:48.330 --> 04:49.331
Yeah, I'm the best.

04:49.665 --> 04:52.167
-Really?
-Oh, yeah. I'm Uncle Sam.

04:53.627 --> 04:54.628
That's funny.

05:05.514 --> 05:06.849
-All right.
-I'll see you soon?

05:06.932 --> 05:07.808
-Yeah.
-Okay.

05:07.891 --> 05:08.725
Bye.

05:09.226 --> 05:11.353
Hey. Morning. Sorry.

05:13.730 --> 05:14.982
Shirt's on inside out.

05:15.065 --> 05:16.567
What-- How'd you even see that?

05:16.650 --> 05:19.278
Does it bother you
to be such a cliché millennial?

05:19.361 --> 05:21.280
No. I'm actually kinda loving it.

05:23.073 --> 05:25.659
So did you think any more
about my suggestion?

05:27.619 --> 05:28.620
-I don't know.
-Come on.

05:29.288 --> 05:31.623
"Taylor Brothers Construction"
has a much better ring to it

05:31.707 --> 05:33.166
than "Taylor Construction."

05:33.250 --> 05:34.960
Yeah, and I kinda like things
the way they are.

05:35.419 --> 05:37.004
So, make it more permanent.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.632
Do this with me. Aren't you tired
of fixing up other people's homes?

05:40.716 --> 05:42.676
Before you know it,
we can afford this place ourselves.

05:42.759 --> 05:45.429
Jake, I love ya. I do.
It's your dream. It's not mine.

05:45.804 --> 05:48.015
-It's Honus Wagner all over again.
-No, it's not.

05:48.098 --> 05:48.932
-Yeah.
-No, it's not.

05:49.016 --> 05:52.060
Yeah, it is. How many yard sales
did you make me go to? Twenty?

05:52.352 --> 05:53.353
It was not 20.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.440
It was, like, 15.

05:56.523 --> 05:59.443
Yeah, to find
the holy grail of baseball cards.

05:59.818 --> 06:02.237
Which you were sure
someone just forgot about,

06:02.321 --> 06:04.323
and we could find it
and sell it for a million bucks.

06:04.406 --> 06:05.616
Yeah, it was a good plan.

06:05.991 --> 06:07.451
Yeah, for an eight-year-old.

06:08.785 --> 06:09.953
You're always searching.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.663
-Yeah, what's wrong with that?
-Nothing.

06:12.080 --> 06:16.335
But if this life isn't for you,
stop wasting both our times.

06:16.418 --> 06:17.753
Go find out what is.

06:18.629 --> 06:20.589
But I'm having so much fun, though.

06:20.672 --> 06:21.924
Come on. Look at this.

06:22.716 --> 06:26.386
We got 60 watt. We got 90 watt.
Gotta go 90, right?

06:26.470 --> 06:27.721
Edison bulbs.

06:28.180 --> 06:30.307
Old house, old bulbs.

07:15.269 --> 07:17.271
Hey. Hungry?

07:18.021 --> 07:20.148
Oh, look at that. Buried treasure.

07:27.906 --> 07:30.617
"Cabbage."
Pretty loose definition of "treasure."

07:35.330 --> 07:36.331
Wow.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.334
You know,
you can't swipe one of those things.

07:39.418 --> 07:41.003
No, I just...

07:42.921 --> 07:43.922
I don't know.

07:45.340 --> 07:46.884
I don't know. She seems kinda...

07:49.386 --> 07:50.387
Ah, damn it.

07:54.683 --> 07:55.809
-Ready?
-Yeah.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.233
-Jake, grab the door.
-Got it.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.541
Damn it. The breaker.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.294
I got it. I got it. Hang on.

09:04.962 --> 09:08.382
Jake? Hey, Jake, the breaker's on.

09:09.925 --> 09:15.430
<i>There's a saying
Goin' all around this town</i>

09:15.514 --> 09:19.685
<i>And I'm beginning to think it's true</i>

09:21.895 --> 09:25.858
<i>It's awful hard to love someone</i>

09:26.692 --> 09:29.945
<i>When they don't care about you</i>

09:31.780 --> 09:35.993
<i>I once had a sweetheart</i>

09:36.076 --> 09:40.372
<i>Just as good as any in this town</i>

09:41.665 --> 09:46.044
<i>But now I'm sad and lonely</i>

09:47.045 --> 09:51.383
<i>He done turned me down</i>

09:52.551 --> 09:59.558
<i>I ain't got nobody</i>

10:02.394 --> 10:08.650
<i>Nobody cares for me--</i>

10:14.198 --> 10:16.283
Who are you? What are you doing here?

10:16.366 --> 10:18.160
-You're her.
-Don't-- Don't come any closer.

10:18.243 --> 10:20.287
What? No. No, I'm not gonna hurt you.

10:20.370 --> 10:21.371
-I just--
-Are you from the bank?

10:21.455 --> 10:22.581
No, listen, I'm not from the bank.

10:22.664 --> 10:25.375
-I'm restoring this house with my brother.
-You're lying. We have until February 5th.

10:25.459 --> 10:27.169
I don't know what the hell
is going on here.

10:27.252 --> 10:29.671
You're trespassing. That's what's
going on. And you need to leave.

10:29.755 --> 10:30.756
Jake!

10:30.839 --> 10:33.759
You-- You can't go up there!

10:36.345 --> 10:37.346
Jake!

10:38.388 --> 10:39.681
Jake!

10:41.433 --> 10:43.101
You have five seconds
to state your business

10:43.185 --> 10:44.811
before I splatter your brains
all over this wall.

10:44.895 --> 10:46.522
-That's really not necessary. Just listen.
-Five...

10:46.605 --> 10:47.940
-Where is my brother?
-Four...

10:48.023 --> 10:49.733
-Can you please stop counting?
-Three...

10:50.108 --> 10:51.109
Jake?

10:52.611 --> 10:53.612
Jake?

10:55.322 --> 10:57.574
Now, listen. My mother is about
to walk through that door,

10:57.658 --> 10:59.284
and she is mean as a snake,

10:59.368 --> 11:01.245
and she hates bankers even more than I do.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.330
-I mean it!
-Please, just--

11:03.413 --> 11:04.915
If you value your life,
you better start running.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.625
-Just listen to me, okay?
-Go!

11:07.209 --> 11:09.503
Get outta here! Leave!

11:19.972 --> 11:21.181
Evelyn?

11:22.474 --> 11:24.518
-Yeah?
-Is there someone here?

11:25.102 --> 11:27.396
What? No, of course not.

11:29.523 --> 11:32.234
-What's in the box?
-A dress for your engagement party.

11:32.317 --> 11:34.695
-It's a gift from William.
-I already have a dress.

11:34.778 --> 11:36.697
William wants you to wear this dress.

11:36.780 --> 11:38.073
What if it doesn't fit?

11:38.699 --> 11:39.700
You'll make it fit.

12:08.604 --> 12:09.605
Excuse me.

13:17.005 --> 13:19.007
Evelyn, are you listening to music?

13:22.761 --> 13:24.388
Give me those phonographs.

13:27.266 --> 13:30.102
There is a certain behavior
that is expected of a lady, Evelyn.

13:30.185 --> 13:31.478
But Emmett loved music.

13:31.562 --> 13:33.397
Your brother is dead and buried.

13:34.398 --> 13:36.024
And here we are,
without a penny to our name.

13:36.108 --> 13:37.818
That's why you're marrying me off
to the highest bidder.

13:37.901 --> 13:39.069
You could do worse.

13:39.152 --> 13:42.281
William is a good father.
He's a temperate, God-fearing man.

13:42.364 --> 13:43.365
Why don't you marry him?

13:43.448 --> 13:45.868
I will not allow you
to squander this opportunity.

13:45.951 --> 13:49.830
William will not understand
your perverse taste in music, Evelyn.

13:49.913 --> 13:52.416
So, I beg you, give me those.

13:56.879 --> 13:57.880
Yes, Ma.

13:58.839 --> 14:00.090
Actually, those are mine.

14:00.174 --> 14:02.718
Sorry, I knocked, but no one
was at the front door--

14:02.801 --> 14:04.178
And who might you be?

14:04.261 --> 14:05.429
Sam.

14:06.763 --> 14:09.057
Sam Taylor.
I was friends with your son.

14:10.142 --> 14:12.644
I loaned him those records.
I was just coming to pick 'em up.

14:12.728 --> 14:13.979
You're a friend of Emmett's?

14:14.730 --> 14:16.899
Did you practice together?

14:19.484 --> 14:20.736
They were classmates.

14:22.571 --> 14:23.614
Medical school.

14:24.948 --> 14:25.949
Sam's a doctor.

14:27.868 --> 14:28.869
Well...

14:29.912 --> 14:31.872
It's always nice
to meet a friend of Emmett's.

14:31.955 --> 14:34.124
-Please, take your things.
-Thank you.

14:34.708 --> 14:36.084
Will you be joining us tonight?

14:36.460 --> 14:37.628
I'm sorry, tonight?

14:37.711 --> 14:39.129
At Evelyn's engagement party.

14:40.923 --> 14:44.510
Oh, that's very kind of you,
but I'm only passing through.

14:44.927 --> 14:46.345
I see.

14:46.428 --> 14:48.305
Well, I trust you can show yourself out.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.598
Yes, ma'am. Right away.

14:55.479 --> 14:56.480
Here you go.

14:57.022 --> 15:00.025
-I owe you a debt of gratitude.
-Yeah, no. Don't even worry about it.

15:00.817 --> 15:02.236
What on earth are you doing?

15:02.319 --> 15:05.405
Sorry, is there, like... a trapdoor

15:05.489 --> 15:07.741
or some kinda secret exit
or something in here?

15:07.824 --> 15:09.326
People usually use the front door.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.078
Hey, look,
I promise I'm trying to go home.

15:11.161 --> 15:12.579
I just-- I don't know how.

15:12.663 --> 15:15.040
Why can't you go home? Where are you from?

15:15.374 --> 15:17.209
I can answer that,
but you're not gonna believe me.

15:18.252 --> 15:19.878
-Give me a chance.
-Okay, fine.

15:20.337 --> 15:22.756
I'm from the future. The year 2019.

15:25.300 --> 15:26.760
My very own time traveler.

15:26.844 --> 15:29.179
All right, you want proof?
Here, look at my phone.

15:30.264 --> 15:31.849
Your telephone is in your pocket?

15:31.932 --> 15:33.892
No, I know. I know I had it.
I must've dropped it or some--

15:34.810 --> 15:38.230
Okay. Here, this.
This, look, see? See this?

15:39.106 --> 15:40.774
That's you, isn't it?

15:40.858 --> 15:42.484
Where do you think I got this?

15:42.568 --> 15:44.862
I found it here in this house
in the future.

15:45.737 --> 15:47.739
Well, that's impossible.
I've never had my picture taken.

15:47.823 --> 15:51.034
Well, not yet. But clearly you will.
See? I knew you wouldn't believe me.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.078
Well, then how did you get here?

15:53.161 --> 15:55.247
Trust me, I'm still trying
to figure that out myself.

15:56.331 --> 15:59.710
I don't know how this works. Okay.
It's gotta be something about this house.

15:59.793 --> 16:01.587
Is there anything unusual about it?

16:02.045 --> 16:04.423
My grandfather built it 40 years ago.

16:04.506 --> 16:06.008
Grandfather? Okay, can I talk to him?

16:06.091 --> 16:08.552
Now is not a good time.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.596
My family's all very occupied
at the moment.

16:10.679 --> 16:12.639
Right, with the engagement party.

16:14.892 --> 16:16.435
The one that I just got invited to.

16:16.518 --> 16:17.519
-No.
-Yes.

16:17.895 --> 16:18.896
-No.
-Yes.

16:18.979 --> 16:20.981
What happened to
the whole debt of gratitude thing?

16:21.064 --> 16:23.358
Look, I'm not--
I'm not asking you to believe me.

16:23.859 --> 16:26.028
Okay, I'm just--
I'm asking you to help me.

16:28.572 --> 16:30.532
Well, you're not exactly
dressed for a party.

16:31.909 --> 16:33.911
But I may have something.

16:38.582 --> 16:41.502
There's my granddaddy. Come on.
I'll introduce you.

16:45.255 --> 16:46.924
-Look here.
-Granddad.

16:47.007 --> 16:48.133
Hey.

16:49.551 --> 16:50.719
-Evelyn.
-Hello.

16:51.220 --> 16:53.597
This is Sam,
Emmett's friend from medical school.

16:55.015 --> 16:58.769
This is Grandpa Warren.
Did I mention that he built our house?

16:58.852 --> 17:00.103
It's a beautiful home, sir.

17:00.187 --> 17:01.480
Why, thank you kindly.

17:01.563 --> 17:03.649
I noticed you built
a storm cellar in the basement.

17:03.732 --> 17:06.401
-That was a smart move.
-Well, you gotta have one in these parts.

17:06.484 --> 17:09.488
Yeah, yeah. I was curious,
is there anything weird about that cellar?

17:09.946 --> 17:12.741
-What do you mean by "weird"?
-I guess what I mean is

17:12.824 --> 17:16.036
I was down there during a really bad storm
and my ears started ringing.

17:16.118 --> 17:17.371
I was just wondering why that was.

17:17.454 --> 17:20.082
Well, that's easy. During a bad storm,

17:20.165 --> 17:22.960
the air pressure drops,
and that gives you the ringing.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.377
Really? Okay, can you tell me more?

17:27.631 --> 17:29.842
Good evening, everyone.
Welcome to my home.

17:30.592 --> 17:33.762
As most of you know,
my children lost their beloved mother...

17:34.763 --> 17:36.431
last year to influenza.

17:37.474 --> 17:39.518
And although she can never be replaced,

17:39.601 --> 17:45.148
we are fortunate to have found
someone wonderful to join our family.

17:45.732 --> 17:46.733
Evelyn Porter.

17:55.242 --> 17:57.536
And now, the only question
that remains is...

17:58.579 --> 18:00.581
Can she dance a turkey trot?

18:09.798 --> 18:11.049
Wonderful news, my darling.

18:11.133 --> 18:13.385
I have arranged
for the wedding announcement

18:13.468 --> 18:17.014
a sitting... with a photographer.

18:17.723 --> 18:19.224
-A photograph?
-Yes.

18:20.225 --> 18:24.897
I must have a photo of you
in your bridal gown.

18:25.606 --> 18:27.357
For posterity.

18:31.320 --> 18:33.322
The young doctor. Who is he?

18:35.991 --> 18:38.118
Friend of Emmett's. Just passing through.

18:39.912 --> 18:41.205
I need someone to dance with.

18:41.747 --> 18:42.956
Oh, okay.

18:43.040 --> 18:46.084
I'd love to, but I just-- I don't really
know how to do the turkey trot.

18:46.168 --> 18:47.169
I'll teach you.

18:49.338 --> 18:53.175
He seems to have a way with my girls.

19:09.608 --> 19:12.236
Mildred, it's past your bedtime.

19:12.945 --> 19:13.946
Good dancing with ya.

19:14.905 --> 19:17.950
Thank you for entertaining my daughter.

19:18.408 --> 19:19.618
Yeah, sure.

19:27.251 --> 19:30.671
You were right. The photograph.
It was me. It will be.

19:30.754 --> 19:33.340
I don't know how. But... it will.

19:33.423 --> 19:35.843
Look, the guy who's friends
with your grandpa,

19:35.926 --> 19:37.761
the one who knew all about the weather,
where did he go?

19:37.845 --> 19:39.805
Henry Barrett? He just left.

19:43.225 --> 19:45.435
My fiancé just went
to put the children to bed.

19:46.144 --> 19:47.771
Would you care to go for a walk?

19:49.481 --> 19:50.482
Yeah.

19:52.484 --> 19:55.028
The future. What's it really like?

19:58.657 --> 20:01.201
I don't know. I guess it can be
anything you want it to be.

20:02.786 --> 20:05.455
You can order food to your house
instead of cooking sometimes.

20:06.707 --> 20:11.044
And it can be anything too.
It can be Italian, Chinese, Indian.

20:11.128 --> 20:13.338
-Indian food?
-Yeah. Yeah.

20:15.048 --> 20:17.885
And music. Music.
There's things called speakers.

20:18.302 --> 20:20.012
You can put one
in every room in your house

20:20.095 --> 20:22.139
and you can have music everywhere,
all the time.

20:25.350 --> 20:26.852
I want all of that.

20:27.603 --> 20:29.354
Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty cool.

20:31.440 --> 20:32.733
Cool.

20:34.193 --> 20:36.862
Wait. The Compound. I've seen that before.

20:38.405 --> 20:42.034
My brother Emmett once told me
that there's a speakeasy below.

20:42.117 --> 20:45.287
And everyone stays up until dawn
laughing and laughing.

20:47.873 --> 20:50.375
I would shoot off my left pinkie
to see it.

20:51.335 --> 20:52.336
You wanna try?

20:52.878 --> 20:54.755
Well, you have to have
a password to get in.

21:03.722 --> 21:06.308
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have anything to drink in here?

21:06.391 --> 21:07.392
How 'bout a root beer?

21:07.476 --> 21:10.729
Well, actually we were hoping
for something with a little cabbage.

21:13.023 --> 21:14.024
What'd you say?

21:14.358 --> 21:15.859
I said "cabbage."

21:21.240 --> 21:22.241
Follow me.

22:04.491 --> 22:06.326
-Hello.
-What will it be?

22:07.911 --> 22:09.037
Liquor, please.

22:09.621 --> 22:12.416
Gin and tonic, squeeze of lime.
Two of those.

22:12.499 --> 22:13.417
All right, two bits.

22:13.917 --> 22:16.712
Two bits... Yeah.

22:20.716 --> 22:22.050
Here, does that cover it?

22:24.761 --> 22:26.013
What are you trying to pull?

22:26.388 --> 22:27.598
I've got it.

22:32.186 --> 22:33.103
Thank you.

22:33.187 --> 22:34.188
Thank you.

22:34.938 --> 22:37.566
William never lets me leave the house
without a few coins.

22:48.869 --> 22:49.870
Thanks.

22:52.289 --> 22:54.124
-To the future.
-To the future.

22:58.086 --> 22:59.087
Wow.

23:11.517 --> 23:13.268
-Wanna dance?
-Sure.

23:59.481 --> 24:02.067
Hey, you know what?
I think you oughta go do a song.

24:03.652 --> 24:05.779
-You oughta eat a cup of dirt.
-I'm serious.

24:05.863 --> 24:06.780
So am I.

24:06.864 --> 24:08.866
All right.
I'll tell you what. Flip a coin.

24:08.949 --> 24:11.243
Heads, I'll go outside
and eat a literal cup of dirt.

24:12.077 --> 24:13.996
Tails, you go do a song. Deal?

24:15.080 --> 24:16.081
Deal.

24:19.293 --> 24:20.294
Darn.

24:23.297 --> 24:26.133
Excuse me, man.
Is it cool if the lady sings one?

24:27.259 --> 24:29.052
Okay. Thank you.

24:30.721 --> 24:31.930
Okay, you're up.

24:38.103 --> 24:39.188
Thank you.

24:41.481 --> 24:43.483
-Do you know "After You've Gone"?
-Yeah.

24:43.984 --> 24:45.194
-That one.
-Okay.

24:52.868 --> 24:57.831
<i>You know I loved you for these many years</i>

24:57.915 --> 25:02.044
<i>Loved you night and day</i>

25:04.671 --> 25:09.510
<i>Oh, honey, baby, can't you see my tears?</i>

25:10.260 --> 25:14.848
<i>Listen while I say</i>

25:16.517 --> 25:21.939
<i>After you've gone and left me crying</i>

25:22.272 --> 25:28.070
<i>After you've gone, there's no denying</i>

25:28.153 --> 25:33.700
<i>You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad</i>

25:34.743 --> 25:39.831
<i>You'll miss the only pal you've ever had</i>

25:40.332 --> 25:45.963
<i>There'll come a time when you'll regret it</i>

25:46.046 --> 25:51.760
<i>There'll come a time and don't forget it</i>

25:52.261 --> 25:58.100
<i>Oh, babe, think what you're doin'</i>

25:58.684 --> 26:04.231
<i>You know my love for you
Will drive me to ruin</i>

26:04.314 --> 26:06.400
<i>After you've gone</i>

26:07.234 --> 26:11.321
<i>After you've gone away</i>

26:12.114 --> 26:16.535
<i>Away</i>

26:23.542 --> 26:25.252
I have never felt like that before.

26:25.711 --> 26:29.256
My heart... was pounding out of my chest.

26:29.339 --> 26:30.966
My God, you were incredible.
You were incredible!

26:31.049 --> 26:33.218
See, what did I tell you?
You belong on that stage.

26:33.302 --> 26:35.137
-You really think so?
-Yes. Are you kidding me?

26:35.220 --> 26:37.014
Did you see the crowd? They were smitten.

26:37.598 --> 26:39.349
I wasn't looking at the crowd.

26:40.642 --> 26:41.894
Evelyn!

26:43.437 --> 26:44.813
What do you think you're doing?

26:45.063 --> 26:48.150
Hey, look, it's not her fault.
I needed something from the pharmacy.

26:48.233 --> 26:50.235
-She was just showing me the way--
-Don't play me for a fool.

26:50.527 --> 26:53.113
I know exactly what this place is
and what goes on in here.

26:53.197 --> 26:54.656
You never cared when Emmett
would come here.

26:54.740 --> 26:58.952
Emmett was a doctor. You are a young lady
and an engaged one at that.

26:59.036 --> 27:02.164
-She doesn't even love the guy. Are you--
-This is none of your concern!

27:04.499 --> 27:06.335
Hey, Evelyn,
you don't have to go with her.

27:09.671 --> 27:10.672
You know nothing.

27:14.176 --> 27:15.177
Come on, dear.

27:24.269 --> 27:27.231
Henry? Sam Taylor, from the party.

27:27.314 --> 27:29.650
The boy with the ringin' ears.

27:29.733 --> 27:30.734
Yeah, that's right.

27:31.401 --> 27:34.446
Listen, we never got to finish
our conversation from last night.

27:34.530 --> 27:36.657
About the storm
and the low air pressure.

27:36.740 --> 27:38.283
Not sure what's left to talk about.

27:38.367 --> 27:40.077
Well, I meant to ask you.

27:40.160 --> 27:42.996
Let's say I need the pressure to drop
like that again so my ears would ring.

27:43.080 --> 27:45.374
How would I know when
the air pressure drops low enough?

27:47.501 --> 27:48.502
Come here.

27:51.713 --> 27:53.507
This here is a barometer.

27:53.590 --> 27:55.676
You hang it on your wall.

27:55.759 --> 27:59.805
When the storm strikes, the needle drops.

28:00.597 --> 28:02.808
Yeah, I've seen one of these before.

28:02.891 --> 28:05.561
The pressure, when it dropped,
the needle, it jumped off the dial.

28:06.645 --> 28:10.148
Off the dial, huh?
Well, that'd have to be a derecho.

28:11.108 --> 28:15.028
You know those really bad storms
that we had lately? That's a derecho.

28:15.571 --> 28:17.573
Lasts anywhere from a week to two.

28:18.073 --> 28:22.536
Storm rolls in and out and turns vicious
in the blink of an eye.

28:22.619 --> 28:24.079
So it could last another week?

28:24.454 --> 28:27.124
Give or take. It ain't an exact science.

28:27.916 --> 28:29.960
Okay, and during this derecho,

28:30.752 --> 28:33.964
the storm, it'll drop the pressure again
just like it did before? You sure?

28:34.590 --> 28:36.216
Most likely, I'd wager.

28:36.758 --> 28:42.055
You know, that last one split my oak
and knocked the doors right off my barn.

28:42.514 --> 28:43.515
Sorry to hear that.

28:45.267 --> 28:47.311
Listen, would you mind if I borrowed that?

28:48.812 --> 28:51.815
Well, I'm not in the business
of givin' things away.

28:53.817 --> 28:57.905
Hey, wait, wait. Your barn doors.
You need help fixin' 'em?

28:59.531 --> 29:02.951
Pretty good with my hands if...
if you'd be up for a trade.

29:13.712 --> 29:15.047
-Go away.
-You're leaving?

29:15.130 --> 29:18.050
-What, are they sending you somewhere?
-I'm sending me somewhere.

29:18.509 --> 29:19.510
Where?

29:20.886 --> 29:22.012
Anywhere but here.

29:22.095 --> 29:25.474
All right, wait, wait. I went and saw
your granddad's friend. That guy, Henry?

29:26.683 --> 29:28.685
I think I know
how we can get back to 2019.

29:33.649 --> 29:34.816
We?

29:34.900 --> 29:37.402
Yeah. You don't deserve this.

29:39.863 --> 29:43.575
You deserve to be free and happy.

29:44.159 --> 29:47.704
To be who you wanna be
and who you wanna be with.

29:48.205 --> 29:49.373
It doesn't have to be me.

29:49.456 --> 29:51.834
But if you come with me,
you can have all those things.

29:55.045 --> 29:58.257
You don't belong here. You know that.

30:00.884 --> 30:04.930
All we need is the storm to worsen
and the pressure to drop, okay?

30:05.013 --> 30:08.642
Look. Now, I found this
in the cellar in 2019.

30:09.101 --> 30:11.103
It must mean
that I'm the one who put it there.

30:12.354 --> 30:16.358
Maybe all this always happened. Maybe you
were always meant to come back with me.

30:22.406 --> 30:24.116
I know it sounds crazy. I ju--

30:39.882 --> 30:41.550
Wedding's in ten days.

30:43.177 --> 30:45.053
What if the storm doesn't come by then?

30:45.637 --> 30:48.223
It's here now. We just--
We have to wait for it to get worse.

31:46.532 --> 31:48.367
Soon. Soon.

32:22.317 --> 32:23.318
Hi.

32:31.118 --> 32:32.327
-Hey, kid.
-Yeah.

32:35.205 --> 32:36.206
You do nice work.

32:37.082 --> 32:38.625
Thanks. It's gettin' there.

32:39.001 --> 32:40.002
Yeah.

32:40.085 --> 32:41.879
The missus wants you to stay for dinner.

32:42.379 --> 32:45.549
How do you feel about pork loin
and rhubarb pie?

32:47.050 --> 32:49.428
Not sure what a rhubarb is,
but sounds good to me.

32:51.889 --> 32:55.017
Now, stay very, very still.
This is a long exposure.

32:55.100 --> 32:56.435
We don't want you blurry.

32:58.812 --> 33:00.564
Give us a smile, dear.

33:01.190 --> 33:06.028
I wanna always remember you like this.
Young. Beautiful.

33:09.656 --> 33:10.657
Well...

33:14.077 --> 33:15.078
Hold.

33:17.289 --> 33:20.083
Good. All right, a little longer.

33:20.542 --> 33:22.085
And...

33:23.462 --> 33:26.381
Damn. We're losing the light.
We'll need another one.

33:27.257 --> 33:29.843
I'm feeling a bit light-headed. Pardon me.

33:40.854 --> 33:42.439
Hey. Hey, hey. Come on!

33:42.898 --> 33:44.316
-Is it time?
-Almost.

33:48.779 --> 33:50.239
Come on. Come on.

33:55.911 --> 33:58.747
You think I didn't know?
You think I wouldn't find out?

33:59.206 --> 34:02.793
-Parading around like some common whore.
-Isn't that what you want?

34:03.418 --> 34:07.047
This marriage is only about money.
And that's not who I am!

34:08.047 --> 34:11.051
-Hey! Don't touch her! Don't touch her!
-No! No! No--

34:11.467 --> 34:13.136
You can't force me to marry you!

34:13.219 --> 34:14.888
-I won't let it happen!
-The hell I can't!

34:15.639 --> 34:17.724
Sam! Sam!

34:33.949 --> 34:37.159
Evelyn! Evelyn!

34:40.038 --> 34:41.581
-Hey!
-What? Whoa!

34:41.665 --> 34:44.543
-Hey! Where is she? Where the hell is she?
-Whoa, what are you doing?

34:46.753 --> 34:51.884
Here. Here. This, this. See this?
How did I get this, huh?

34:52.384 --> 34:54.052
Jake, this proves I was there.

34:54.719 --> 34:58.098
All this proves is that you found
another matchbook in better condition.

34:58.182 --> 34:59.975
No, no, no. You're not listening to me.

35:00.058 --> 35:03.187
I am,
and I really just think you hit your head.

35:04.605 --> 35:05.647
I didn't, though.

35:07.065 --> 35:08.734
I didn't. I didn't. It was real.

35:09.401 --> 35:11.653
She-- She was real, I--

35:13.614 --> 35:14.615
Okay, listen.

35:16.491 --> 35:19.161
She's a piece of history
that got lodged in your brain.

35:19.244 --> 35:20.245
No, no.

35:20.537 --> 35:24.208
But whoever she is, she's long gone now.

35:28.378 --> 35:32.758
Now let's pack up, okay?
I wanna get home before Alice goes to bed.

35:44.728 --> 35:46.438
Come on, man. Get your stuff.

35:48.941 --> 35:49.983
I can't go.

35:51.568 --> 35:54.363
I gotta stay.
I gotta find a way back to her.

35:54.738 --> 35:56.573
Get in the truck.

35:56.949 --> 35:58.534
Roger made empanadas.

35:59.451 --> 36:02.538
Let's go eat some,
and smoke a bowl and maybe eat some more.

36:09.628 --> 36:12.297
I'm gonna need to borrow your cell phone,
your lightning cable

36:12.381 --> 36:14.383
and that blanket you keep
in the back of the truck.

36:15.425 --> 36:17.344
I'm gonna stay here.
I gotta figure this out.

36:18.262 --> 36:19.513
Jake, please.

36:38.031 --> 36:39.366
No, no, no.

36:50.460 --> 36:54.381
<i>The derecho that we're in right now
is what we call a "super derecho."</i>

36:55.757 --> 37:00.470
<i>It's highly destructive,
but, luckily, it's extremely rare.</i>

37:01.221 --> 37:04.558
<i>The last super derecho
was around a hundred years ago.</i>

37:04.933 --> 37:05.934
1919.

37:06.018 --> 37:07.603
<i>Sadly, thanks to global warming,</i>

37:07.686 --> 37:10.314
<i>the intervals between
these vicious storms are shrinking.</i>

37:10.397 --> 37:13.066
<i>We'll probably see the next one
in ten or 15 years.</i>

37:13.150 --> 37:14.776
No, no. Can't wait that long.

37:46.850 --> 37:47.935
-Hey.
-Hey.

37:48.435 --> 37:52.147
Come over for dinner, yeah?
Alice misses her Uncle Sam.

37:53.065 --> 37:55.734
No, I can't. I can't. I gotta stay.

37:59.029 --> 38:00.489
-Sam.
-That's it. That's it.

38:01.281 --> 38:02.282
Sam!

38:07.120 --> 38:08.497
Come on. Come on. Come on.

38:33.522 --> 38:37.526
<i>Hush, little baby, don't say a word</i>

38:38.610 --> 38:42.072
<i>Papa's gonna buy you a mockingbird</i>

38:43.282 --> 38:46.952
<i>If that mockingbird won't sing</i>

38:47.494 --> 38:50.789
<i>Papa's gonna buy you a diamond ring</i>

38:52.457 --> 38:55.878
<i>If that diamond ring is brass</i>

38:56.753 --> 39:00.215
<i>Papa's gonna buy you a looking glass</i>

39:01.300 --> 39:04.303
Good night, Sam. Happy birthday.

39:15.606 --> 39:21.236
<i>If that looking glass is broke
Papa's gonna buy you--</i>

39:21.862 --> 39:23.280
Mommy. Is someone there?

39:40.672 --> 39:42.007
-Sam.
-Jake?

39:42.090 --> 39:43.050
What the hell is that? What'd you do?

39:43.133 --> 39:45.719
We put in the wine cellar.
You knew the client wanted it.

39:45.802 --> 39:48.514
No, no, no. You changed it.
You changed it. You changed it.

39:48.597 --> 39:50.057
-You changed the air pressure down here.
-Hey! Hey!

39:50.140 --> 39:52.684
-Sent me to the future, not the past.
-Sam! Jesus, Sam.

39:52.768 --> 39:55.103
-Sam, Sam, you're babbling.
-You gotta help me get it outta here.

39:55.187 --> 39:58.440
Look, I went to the future,
and I saw her. I saw her.

39:58.524 --> 40:00.067
We-- We had a kid.

40:01.276 --> 40:03.070
We had this beautiful little boy.

40:04.947 --> 40:08.033
But none of that can happen if I don't
get back to her and save her, okay?

40:08.116 --> 40:10.410
-Do you understand that?
-I'm really worried about you.

40:10.494 --> 40:12.955
Yeah, I get that, Jake.
But I just need your help right now, okay?

40:14.331 --> 40:17.084
If I get this stuff outta here,
will you go see a doctor?

40:19.127 --> 40:20.963
Yes. Yes. Okay. I promise.

40:34.685 --> 40:36.812
Okay. Come on now.

40:41.441 --> 40:42.442
Sorry, Jake.

40:43.235 --> 40:46.154
Sam! Don't do this. Sam, come on!

40:47.698 --> 40:48.699
Sam!

41:00.711 --> 41:01.712
Evelyn!

41:03.630 --> 41:04.631
Evelyn!

41:23.901 --> 41:24.902
Sam?

41:26.278 --> 41:27.279
We gotta go. Now!

41:39.583 --> 41:41.043
Come on. Come on!

41:42.169 --> 41:43.879
-Sam!
-It's okay. We'll be fine. We'll be fine.

41:43.962 --> 41:45.797
I promise. But we have to go now.

41:55.140 --> 41:56.225
My leg's stuck.

42:07.903 --> 42:08.904
What are you doing?

42:09.530 --> 42:11.490
All right. Listen. You have to go.

42:12.783 --> 42:16.245
-No, no! Not with-- Not without you.
-No. Hey, hey. Listen. Listen.

42:17.496 --> 42:19.081
I went to the future, okay?

42:20.290 --> 42:21.917
-What?
-I saw you.

42:22.668 --> 42:26.296
You had a son. You had a little boy.

42:27.047 --> 42:28.340
You were singing to him.

42:31.134 --> 42:32.302
You're gonna make it.

42:33.011 --> 42:36.014
Oh, we... We have a son?

42:36.932 --> 42:37.975
No.

42:40.143 --> 42:41.144
You do.

42:43.272 --> 42:44.398
I wasn't there.

42:45.232 --> 42:46.316
-No.
-Yeah.

42:46.400 --> 42:47.401
No.

42:47.818 --> 42:49.987
This is what's supposed to happen. Yeah.

42:50.070 --> 42:51.071
No.

42:51.154 --> 42:54.074
-Trust me.
-No. No. I don't want that life.

42:57.786 --> 43:00.455
-It's okay. It's gonna be okay.
-No.

43:01.748 --> 43:02.749
Listen, listen.

43:03.417 --> 43:04.710
Tell my brother I love him.

43:07.963 --> 43:09.256
He's gonna help you.

43:10.465 --> 43:12.759
-Go.
-No, no, no!

43:18.891 --> 43:21.226
-Evelyn.
-No! Sam. Sam.

43:21.310 --> 43:22.519
-Sam.
-Evelyn.

43:22.603 --> 43:24.855
-Sam!
-Evelyn. I love you.

43:26.148 --> 43:27.482
But you need to let go now.

43:43.373 --> 43:46.502
Sam. Are you okay?
What the hell's going on?

43:55.886 --> 43:57.387
Sam?

44:22.829 --> 44:23.830
You hungry?

44:27.209 --> 44:28.210
All right, then.

44:31.046 --> 44:34.925
I brought you a change of clothes.
I wasn't sure the exact size.

44:35.008 --> 44:37.427
So, hopefully they fit.

44:46.395 --> 44:48.272
He said there'd be music in every room.

44:55.320 --> 44:56.530
He really loved you.

44:59.449 --> 45:00.659
Told me all about ya.

45:05.873 --> 45:06.957
What'd he say?

45:07.040 --> 45:11.044
Well, it wasn't just what he said,
it was how he said it.

45:13.005 --> 45:14.965
Never heard him talk like that before.

45:17.509 --> 45:21.054
All about your singing.
And your record collection.

45:21.597 --> 45:23.015
Well, they were my brother's.

45:26.310 --> 45:29.521
I hid them down here behind the walls
so my mother wouldn't find them.

45:31.148 --> 45:33.066
Sam saved them for me the day we met.

45:43.827 --> 45:46.330
You know, these walls are the originals.

46:06.225 --> 46:07.309
From Sam.

46:08.310 --> 46:09.311
He made it.

46:12.523 --> 46:13.941
He's in 1919?

46:36.213 --> 46:37.297
<i>Dear Evelyn.</i>

46:37.673 --> 46:39.591
<i>By the time you read this,
I'll be long gone.</i>

46:40.259 --> 46:42.052
<i>But I needed you to know</i>

46:42.970 --> 46:44.680
<i>I didn't die in that storm after all.</i>

46:45.389 --> 46:46.390
He's down here.

46:55.232 --> 46:57.025
<i>I was desperate to get back to you.</i>

47:03.365 --> 47:04.491
<i>I waited for a year,</i>

47:07.703 --> 47:09.371
<i>but no storm came.</i>

47:11.206 --> 47:13.625
<i>I was told one wouldn't,
but I still hoped.</i>

47:16.211 --> 47:17.629
<i>Then I realized something.</i>

47:21.550 --> 47:23.510
<i>As much as you belong in the future...</i>

47:25.304 --> 47:29.433
<i>...maybe this... this is where I belong.</i>

47:32.269 --> 47:33.645
<i>I found my place.</i>

47:35.480 --> 47:36.982
<i>And it was all thanks to you.</i>

47:39.776 --> 47:41.278
<i>I have a life at last.</i>

47:43.906 --> 47:45.741
<i>You know, it's ironic.</i>

47:46.783 --> 47:50.787
<i>I came from a place with too many choices,
and you had none.</i>

47:55.459 --> 47:58.962
<i>And now, it's time for us to move forward.</i>

48:00.631 --> 48:03.634
<i>To put the pieces in place
for our futures to take hold.</i>

48:28.075 --> 48:29.493
Honus Wagner.

48:36.416 --> 48:38.460
<i>I know you'll find this letter, Evelyn.</i>

48:39.378 --> 48:43.215
<i>I know because, like I look for you,
you look for me.</i>

48:45.092 --> 48:48.804
<i>But it's time for you to stop looking.
It's your turn now.</i>

48:51.932 --> 48:55.894
<i>Your life is waiting.
Go out there and get it.</i>

48:58.230 --> 49:01.650
<i>All my love, Sam.</i>

50:08.926 --> 50:10.886
Mommy, is someone there?

50:16.183 --> 50:18.685
No. No, sweetie.

50:19.228 --> 50:23.398
Everything's okay. Everything is fine.
