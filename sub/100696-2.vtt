WEBVTT

00:12.929 --> 00:16.433
[Kenya] Yeah, Mr. Seamus, I think
that sounds like a fair price. Um...

00:16.516 --> 00:19.728
I'll bring it down to you next week.
Thank you, sir. Shalom.

00:22.188 --> 00:24.107
[sighs] So, that's it.

00:24.315 --> 00:26.359
Chain's gone. Found a buyer.

00:26.443 --> 00:28.236
Of gold? Shocking, Dad.

00:28.319 --> 00:29.654
You act like you were trying to sell

00:29.738 --> 00:31.781
a limited edition
Beanie Baby or something.

00:31.865 --> 00:34.034
No, I act like I was trying to sell
a gold chain.

00:34.117 --> 00:35.702
-That I love.
-Okay. My point exactly.

00:35.785 --> 00:37.579
Okay, guys. Come on, we're gonna be late!

00:37.662 --> 00:39.247
[Kenya] Where-- Where's your Mom?

00:39.330 --> 00:40.915
I'll give you two guesses.

00:40.999 --> 00:44.127
She's either still sleeping
or she's still sleeping.

00:44.210 --> 00:46.254
-That's a gray area.
-Doesn't sound gray.

00:46.337 --> 00:48.882
Come on, Kam,
put your other shoe on, please.

00:48.965 --> 00:50.300
Yo, keep it real.

00:50.842 --> 00:53.011
Do you sometimes feel like the mom?

00:53.094 --> 00:54.971
No more than I feel like the dad.

00:55.680 --> 00:56.514
Whoa.

00:56.598 --> 00:58.808
-Was not exp-- Wow.
-I'm kidding.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.143
You're great, Dad.

01:00.560 --> 01:03.730
And to answer your question,
no, I don't feel like the parent.

01:04.272 --> 01:05.523
I feel like the daughter.

01:06.232 --> 01:08.568
The remarkably responsible,

01:09.027 --> 01:11.571
put-upon, lost-youth-having daughter.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.073
But it's cool, yeah!

01:13.156 --> 01:15.909
I know 20 years from now,
it'll make me the person that I am,

01:15.992 --> 01:19.120
which hopefully isn't a sad,
childless doormat.

01:20.288 --> 01:21.414
Just so we're clear,

01:21.915 --> 01:24.167
your mom's worse than I am,
though, right?

01:25.502 --> 01:27.796
You got that from everything I just said.

01:27.879 --> 01:30.632
So yes, I'm hearing. Thank you. Cool.

01:36.012 --> 01:38.264
[Drea] Come on, Kam!
Put your other shoe on.

01:38.348 --> 01:41.142
I might wanna hold off
putting this other shoe on.

01:41.226 --> 01:43.353
They're probably
gonna cancel school today.

01:43.436 --> 01:45.146
A teacher fell out of a window, y'all!

01:45.230 --> 01:46.481
Oh, yeah? Who?

01:46.564 --> 01:49.901
Um... Miss... Miss Lady!

01:50.193 --> 01:53.071
This kid's got a real problem.
Like, a real one.

01:53.154 --> 01:55.573
Lying about teachers
getting defenestrated?

01:55.907 --> 01:56.783
He's broken.

01:57.325 --> 02:01.037
Oh, my God, I've never even met her.
Do you think she's gonna be okay?

02:01.121 --> 02:02.831
No, she fell out of a window.

02:02.914 --> 02:05.041
-And she's not a real person.
-[Kenya] And there's that.

02:05.125 --> 02:08.461
You guys need to stop messing around.
I'm trying to get you to school on time.

02:08.545 --> 02:11.005
[snickers]<i> </i>Doesn't seem like
you're doing a great job.

02:11.089 --> 02:14.467
You know, instead of doing
your normal 30-minute eyelash install,

02:14.551 --> 02:16.427
you're more than welcome
to help out, princess.

02:16.511 --> 02:19.055
How about you run a brush through
your hair before you try and come for me?

02:19.139 --> 02:21.516
The whole not-trying look
only works if you're actually trying.

02:21.599 --> 02:23.101
-I brush my hair. Thank you.
-Oh, who would've thought?

02:23.184 --> 02:25.353
Guys, guys, can you please stop this?

02:25.436 --> 02:28.565
I think we can all agree, neither
one of you are great. Like, at all.

02:28.648 --> 02:30.150
What is happening?

02:30.233 --> 02:31.943
A teacher is dead.

02:32.026 --> 02:33.319
A life has been lost.

02:33.403 --> 02:35.530
Why am I the only one
who cares about this?

02:35.947 --> 02:38.700
-This family's sick.
-[Kenya] Pops, calm down, bro.

02:38.783 --> 02:42.412
I think "Miss Lady" is gonna pull through.
Okay? She's going to be fine. 

02:42.954 --> 02:45.748
Chlo, if you could take Izzy
to Cedar Canyon,

02:45.832 --> 02:48.835
and if you could drop the boys off
to Marlboro, that would be great.

02:49.085 --> 02:53.131
I'd do that, but the boys are boys, Dad,
and Marlboro is an all-girls school.

02:53.214 --> 02:55.091
I mean, this is simple stuff, so...

02:55.175 --> 02:58.720
Then take them to the school they go to.
Dude, this is why your crew's so small.

02:58.803 --> 03:01.139
-You've no friends 'cause of this person.
-[Drea scoffs] Whatever.

03:01.222 --> 03:03.224
Drake said, "No new friends," right?

03:03.308 --> 03:05.476
Drake can say that
because he's got friends!

03:05.560 --> 03:06.561
-She's got a point!
-Boom.

03:06.644 --> 03:08.313
[Drea] Why are--
Why are you like that, Dad?

03:08.396 --> 03:11.065
Like what? Dude, Drake has friends.
He's got Migos,

03:11.149 --> 03:12.734
-OVO dude...
-[Chloe] Future?

03:12.817 --> 03:14.611
The dude he sits with
at the Toronto games.

03:14.694 --> 03:15.820
-[Drea] Okay...
-Groupies!

03:15.904 --> 03:17.405
-And his Mom! He loves his mom.
-I've got friends. I've got--

03:17.488 --> 03:19.699
All-- All on top of each other, okay?
National Society friends.

03:19.782 --> 03:21.576
How does it feel to know
that you're gonna die alone?

03:21.659 --> 03:23.620
-[Drea] I'm not gonna die alone, okay?
-[Kenya] Whoa, oh, oh, oh.

03:23.703 --> 03:25.079
[Joya] Morning, family!

03:25.455 --> 03:28.082
Whoo. [sing-songy] Who wants breakfast?

03:28.166 --> 03:31.461
We all did, like, 45 minutes ago.

03:31.836 --> 03:33.630
Mom, Dad doesn't know
where we go to school!

03:33.713 --> 03:34.672
[Kenya] Of course I do.

03:34.756 --> 03:37.008
-He thinks we go to school with all girls.
-[Kenya] Why would I think that?

03:37.091 --> 03:39.135
That's not true.
I know where you go to school, bud.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.470
He knows where you go to school,

03:40.553 --> 03:42.889
he's just really tired.
He had a really long night last night.

03:43.097 --> 03:44.390
-Hey, thank you.
-[Joya] Yeah.

03:44.474 --> 03:48.436
I mean, drinks with Janelle Monáe
courtside Lakers' seats...

03:48.519 --> 03:50.772
a little after-party at Eddie Murphy's
house with bowling--

03:50.855 --> 03:52.774
I mean, it takes it out of a man!

03:52.857 --> 03:54.400
[baby-talking] He's ti-wahd today.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.778
I can't believe
I thought you actually had my back.

03:56.861 --> 03:59.197
-Wait, you went bowling?
-No, I didn't go bowling.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.950
-You've never taken us bowling.
-Or to a Lakers' game.

04:02.033 --> 04:04.160
He took us to that Clippers' game once.
It was cool.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.787
-Right?
-Yeah.

04:05.870 --> 04:08.831
It was not cool. Like, at all.

04:08.915 --> 04:12.126
It was Chris Kaman bobblehead night
during the Donald Sterling era.

04:12.210 --> 04:14.587
Yeah, and I'm not even sure
the starters came out

04:14.671 --> 04:16.506
after Coolio performed at half-time.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.591
I'm not at those games having fun, dude.

04:18.675 --> 04:22.345
I'm there, like, building relationships,
making capital and currency out of people.

04:22.428 --> 04:23.263
Wow.

04:23.346 --> 04:25.515
I had a lunch with Jeffrey Katzenberg
because I went to that game.

04:25.598 --> 04:27.475
You think if I'm at that game
with you guys,

04:27.558 --> 04:29.727
Jeffrey Katzenberg comes up
and says anything to me?

04:29.811 --> 04:31.604
"I'm the little white man
who's gonna interrupt the guy

04:31.688 --> 04:33.314
talking to his beautiful black family!"

04:33.398 --> 04:35.775
All of a sudden,
there's no lunch with Jeffrey Katzenberg,

04:35.858 --> 04:37.068
then we live in Van Nuys.

04:37.151 --> 04:38.569
-Is that what you want?
-[Joya groans]

04:38.653 --> 04:39.612
Van Nuys.

04:40.029 --> 04:42.699
-I can't live in Van Nuys.
-No one can.

04:42.782 --> 04:45.994
I can't believe you're just gonna sit
on that Jeffrey Katzenberg defense.

04:46.077 --> 04:47.620
-I'm not--
-You really are a sociopath.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.747
I had six children with a sociopath.

04:49.831 --> 04:53.001
I had six children with a woman
who'd have six children with a sociopath.

04:53.084 --> 04:55.878
-What does that make me? I'm the victim!
-Yeah, that makes you a sociopath.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.297
-[Kenya] No, I'm the victim here!
-[Joya] Are you?

04:57.380 --> 04:59.632
You know the reason I don't go
to those games is because of you.

04:59.716 --> 05:00.925
-Oh, it's 'cause of me?
-It's not them,

05:01.009 --> 05:02.885
'cause you always wanna dance hard
and get on the camera.

05:02.969 --> 05:03.886
-Why are you jealous

05:03.970 --> 05:05.513
-'cause I get on the camera?
-[Drea] Guys, guys.

05:05.596 --> 05:07.557
[Chloe] <i>Yeah, Mom and Dad fight a lot,</i>

05:08.141 --> 05:12.020
but I heard that you don't have to really
get scared until they stop fighting.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.939
Honestly, I'm already scared.

05:15.356 --> 05:17.275
You know, that Van Nuys thing
really shook me.

05:17.358 --> 05:19.610
-So it's kind of on you, to be honest.
-[Joya] It is on me, you're right.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.446
I should have gotten out a long time ago.

05:21.529 --> 05:23.614
-I love you so much, don't leave me!
-I won't.

05:23.698 --> 05:24.991
-All right.
-[both laughing]

05:25.074 --> 05:26.909
Okay. All right, guys, come on.
We're gonna be late.

05:26.993 --> 05:27.827
Um...

05:28.161 --> 05:29.746
You have a game today, correct?

05:32.582 --> 05:35.335
I mean, of course you have a game today.
What time is your game?

05:35.418 --> 05:38.338
We have a calendar for your game,
I know when games are. What time is it?

05:38.463 --> 05:41.257
Same time it's been last eight weeks
when you've gotten there and said,

05:41.341 --> 05:42.925
"I thought it was at four."

05:43.009 --> 05:45.803
-So it's not at four?
-Well, you know I won't miss it.

05:45.887 --> 05:48.931
I don't know how I possibly know that,
but okay.

05:49.015 --> 05:51.559
-I'll just be like a tiny bit late.
-There it is.

05:51.642 --> 05:54.062
Because I'm coming from, uh,
Hip-Hop Dave's in Silver Lake,

05:54.145 --> 05:55.897
it's a mandatory class, but I'll be there!

05:56.189 --> 05:59.150
You have a mandatory
hip-hop dance class? Mandatory.

05:59.484 --> 06:01.819
I'm sorry. Am I not allowed self-care?

06:01.903 --> 06:04.572
I mean, do you have any understanding
what dance does

06:04.655 --> 06:06.366
to women's serotonin levels?

06:06.449 --> 06:07.825
There is a study,

06:07.909 --> 06:09.160
-this is facts,
-Sure.

06:09.243 --> 06:10.953
that for every minute a woman works out,

06:11.079 --> 06:13.998
she is twice as likely
not to kill a family member.

06:14.082 --> 06:16.125
This is self-preservation. This is for us.

06:16.209 --> 06:19.295
This is for our whole family.
You are selfish. Damn!

06:19.379 --> 06:21.297
-But I'm the sociopath?
-Yeah.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.256
Oh, my God.

06:22.340 --> 06:23.841
[Kam] Bye-bye, Pops!

06:23.925 --> 06:26.511
-I'm sorry, what is happening right now?
-[Pops] Bye, guys, see you later. 

06:26.594 --> 06:28.930
[Kenya] Is he sick? Are you sick?
What's happening?

06:29.013 --> 06:31.516
No, uh, he's-- he's okay. I just, um...

06:31.766 --> 06:34.352
I told him he could stay home
from school today. He's still...

06:34.560 --> 06:36.479
shaken up over the birthday thing.

06:36.562 --> 06:37.605
What?

06:37.939 --> 06:40.817
You already are letting him wear
a Nike top with Adidas bottoms,

06:40.900 --> 06:42.944
he's dressed as a small serial killer.

06:43.694 --> 06:45.571
Mom said I could take the day.

06:45.655 --> 06:48.658
I think that'd be enough time
for me to pull myself together.

06:49.158 --> 06:51.160
Does that feel like
a good parenting decision to you?

06:51.285 --> 06:52.412
-Yeah.
-Yes.

06:52.829 --> 06:56.040
It is. It's just one day.
I mean, it's not a big deal,

06:56.374 --> 06:58.835
but then tomorrow it's back to school,
right, bud?

06:58.918 --> 07:02.213
-[sadly] Right. Back to the rat race.
-Hmm.

07:02.296 --> 07:04.006
[Kenya]
<i>I don't know if he's gonna be okay.</i>

07:04.090 --> 07:07.009
Like, I really don't. He's a soft kid.

07:07.635 --> 07:09.720
It's a hard fucking world we live in.

07:10.513 --> 07:13.015
What I do know
is I liked things a little bit better

07:13.099 --> 07:14.976
when that Salvadoran nanny
was watching him.

07:15.059 --> 07:18.938
That woman did not play.
She had seen some shit.

07:19.814 --> 07:21.732
[speaking Spanish]

07:29.282 --> 07:31.492
Remember she taught him
how to speak Spanish?

07:31.701 --> 07:33.578
Now, he only speaks it when he's sad.

07:33.661 --> 07:35.788
Calls it "the language of <i>muerte,"</i>

07:36.289 --> 07:37.874
whatever the fuck that means.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.083
[Joya] Mm. [clicks tongue]

07:39.333 --> 07:40.668
<i>Vaya con dios, Papa.</i>

07:40.751 --> 07:41.586
What?

07:41.669 --> 07:43.754
<i>♪ You either with me or against me, ho ♪</i>

07:43.838 --> 07:44.755
<i>♪ Ho ♪</i>

07:44.839 --> 07:46.674
<i>♪ You either with me or</i> ♪

07:46.924 --> 07:47.758

07:47.842 --> 07:50.011

<i>Win, win, win, win  ♪</i>

07:53.806 --> 07:55.600
<i>♪ Win, yeah ♪</i>

07:55.683 --> 07:59.061
Mom and Dad have always argued,
but I'll be honest with you,

07:59.145 --> 08:02.523
ever since Mom took off work,
they really kicked it up a notch.

08:02.607 --> 08:05.818
Yeah, it calmed down a little bit
that first year after Mom had Brooklyn.

08:05.943 --> 08:07.945
I mean, we were all just glad
she was alive.

08:08.029 --> 08:10.406
-Yeah.
-But that wore off.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.366
Guess who's got the goods.

08:12.450 --> 08:15.119
So, we were really happy
to see them spending time

08:15.203 --> 08:16.579
trying to get their shit together.

08:16.662 --> 08:19.165
[Danny] VIP, baby!

08:19.248 --> 08:22.668
The assistant said you are gonna sit
right next to Jay Rock's parents.

08:22.752 --> 08:23.586
What?

08:23.669 --> 08:26.422
Was it weird that it was going to be
at the Lunar Butterfly Festival

08:26.506 --> 08:29.258
where they'd by far be
the oldest people there?

08:29.342 --> 08:30.676
Sure, but...

08:33.763 --> 08:35.598
I don't have a "but,"
it's just really weird.

08:35.681 --> 08:36.516
Yeah.

08:36.807 --> 08:39.310
Dude, I paid all this fucking money
for a VIP pack

08:39.393 --> 08:42.230
and all I get is a Gildan tank top
and a fanny pack?

08:43.105 --> 08:45.024
Babe, is it weird
that we're going to this shit?

08:45.107 --> 08:47.860
No! It's totally cool.
Hip-Hop Dave goes every year.

08:47.944 --> 08:50.613
-That's not making me feel better.
-It should make you feel better.

08:50.696 --> 08:52.865
But, babe, we used to go
to so many concerts.

08:52.949 --> 08:56.202
This is just like 35 concerts,
like, crammed into one night.

08:57.119 --> 09:00.623
Uh, so, I had to use my, uh,
personal credit card to buy the tickets,

09:00.706 --> 09:02.750
-so if you could reimburse me ASAP.
-What material is this?

09:02.833 --> 09:06.212
Uh, I'm barely making enough
to pay my rent. Hello!

09:06.295 --> 09:07.880
[chuckles nervously]
Um, or you could just--

09:07.964 --> 09:09.340
This is one of those things
you can pay on.

09:09.423 --> 09:11.551
-...give me my own Amex, maybe?
-Fyre Festival.

09:11.634 --> 09:14.262
Then we can avoid this conversation
in the future. You get the points.

09:14.345 --> 09:16.389
I never have to front money
for you again.

09:16.472 --> 09:19.475
-It's like a win-win for both of us.
-Dude, did I ask you to bring me a Frap?

09:19.559 --> 09:20.977
-I don't remember.
-Yep, it's in my car.

09:21.060 --> 09:22.311
Okay. Can I get that, please?

09:22.395 --> 09:24.772
Hey, uh, guys? Make sure you
stay hydrated out there, okay?

09:24.855 --> 09:26.232
Nothing's worse than a dry roll.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.150
Dry-- What are you talking about?

09:28.276 --> 09:30.194
Oh, yeah, East LA gets hot as hell.

09:30.278 --> 09:34.031
You know, if you're gonna pop your Molly,
you want to drink a ton of water, right?

09:36.534 --> 09:38.411
You guys are doing Molly, right?

09:38.578 --> 09:42.164
I mean, they pretty much
stick it in your mouth when you walk in.

09:42.248 --> 09:43.374
[laughs]

09:44.542 --> 09:47.378
-Fine, okay. Chloe was three months old,
-That's right. 

09:47.461 --> 09:49.964
it was my birthday, and as my gift,

09:50.047 --> 09:52.717
we decided
that we would take the night off

09:52.800 --> 09:54.135
and just have it to ourselves.

09:54.218 --> 09:56.387
We deserved that. Like, it turned out

09:56.470 --> 09:58.139
that as much as we loved you guys,

09:58.639 --> 10:02.018
being parents at 22 was a little bit more
of a shit-show than we thought it would be

10:02.101 --> 10:04.645
and we needed to blow off some steam.
I mean, all our friends were.

10:05.479 --> 10:06.939
So, it was gonna be great.

10:07.064 --> 10:09.191
We got a babysitter,

10:09.942 --> 10:12.486
dropped Chlo off with the babysitter,

10:12.987 --> 10:15.448
then went, got some drinks,

10:15.823 --> 10:18.034
went to Blockbuster,
which is a thing of the past,

10:18.117 --> 10:19.660
but was a lit place...

10:20.202 --> 10:23.289
It wasn't a lit place.
It was just a place where you got movies.

10:23.623 --> 10:26.667
I... I enjoyed it.
Um, it was a place you got movies,

10:26.751 --> 10:29.420
and you could see people,
sometime bump into exes,

10:29.795 --> 10:31.130
but always come home.

10:31.380 --> 10:34.008
Um, anyway, we got a movie...

10:35.968 --> 10:37.094
came home...

10:37.678 --> 10:39.013
and popped a Molly.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.974
[Joya]
And that is when the babysitter called

10:42.058 --> 10:44.101
to say that she had an emergency

10:44.185 --> 10:46.562
and she had to drop Chloe
back off with us.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.523
[Kenya] That was right around the time
I started being able to hear colors,

10:49.982 --> 10:51.108
and the voice of God.

10:51.192 --> 10:53.319
It's just that we were so young,

10:53.402 --> 10:55.821
and we missed doing
any of the fun stuff, so we thought,

10:55.905 --> 10:58.199
-"Why not just one night?" You know?
-Just once.

10:58.282 --> 11:01.118
Just once.
But of course it didn't work out for us.

11:01.202 --> 11:02.745
Shit doesn't work out for us.

11:03.371 --> 11:05.206
-Hell of a night, though. Honestly.
-[sighing]

11:05.289 --> 11:07.291
Nothing more sobering

11:07.583 --> 11:09.543
than rolling your face off

11:09.960 --> 11:13.297
and looking down in the eyes
of your beautiful infant daughter

11:13.381 --> 11:14.840
knowing that it's probably

11:14.965 --> 11:18.803
the last time you're gonna see her before
Child Services rips her from your arms.

11:19.303 --> 11:20.971
[Joya] Really puts things
into perspective.

11:21.972 --> 11:23.307
And ensures that

11:23.391 --> 11:26.352
we will never do Molly again
as long as we're alive.

11:26.435 --> 11:28.396
As amazing of a drug as it was...

11:28.479 --> 11:29.855
-It's a great drug.
-I'm out.

11:30.606 --> 11:31.732
-Don't do it.
-Never again.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.317
What are we gonna do?

11:33.401 --> 11:35.736
-What do you mean?
-I mean, what are we going to do?

11:36.612 --> 11:37.571
You heard the kid.

11:37.655 --> 11:40.700
Basically, it sounds like we're going
to, like,  Molly Fest or something?

11:40.783 --> 11:43.411
Well, I mean, if everybody's doing it,

11:43.494 --> 11:46.747
it's-- it's really crazy
<i>not</i> to do it, right?

11:46.831 --> 11:48.582
Feels like that's how we roll?

11:49.792 --> 11:50.751
Think so.

11:50.835 --> 11:53.671
-I don't wanna look like fucking weirdos.
-I don't wanna be a weirdo.

11:53.796 --> 11:56.507
-I guess we have to do it.
-We have to do it, right?

11:56.924 --> 11:57.758
Yeah.

11:57.842 --> 11:59.385
These are our parents.

11:59.969 --> 12:02.680
Their legal definition is "guardians."

12:02.763 --> 12:04.849
They're supposed to guard us.

12:04.932 --> 12:06.225
Here you go, it's melting.

12:06.308 --> 12:08.227
Dude, you know where we can get Molly?

12:08.310 --> 12:09.770
Nah. No.

12:09.854 --> 12:12.773
Danny, I've seen you come in here
with eyes on golf balls.

12:12.857 --> 12:14.275
Where can we get Molly?

12:14.358 --> 12:15.359
Okay.

12:15.651 --> 12:19.363
I-- I know someone, but my, uh...
my dealer's kinda scary.

12:19.447 --> 12:21.532
Are you saying your dealer's scary
because he's black?

12:21.615 --> 12:23.701
Oh, no, he's not black. He's Armenian.

12:24.076 --> 12:25.244
That is scary.

12:25.327 --> 12:26.495
[Kenya] <i>It's no secret.</i>

12:26.579 --> 12:29.081
I'm terrified of Armenian gangs.
They scare me.

12:29.665 --> 12:32.251
That's saying a lot. I'm from Inglewood,

12:32.668 --> 12:34.628
and Inglewood's pretty fucked up,

12:34.712 --> 12:36.714
but it's not Armenia fucked-up.

12:36.797 --> 12:40.176
Armenia's next to Iraq,
or Iran, depending on who you ask.

12:40.259 --> 12:42.720
But it doesn't matter, both those places
are really fucked up.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.681
They do fucked up shit
like cut your head off.

12:46.557 --> 12:49.393
I don't play with those gangs,
they scare me a lot.

12:50.144 --> 12:52.396
<i>Danny's dude dealt out of</i>
<i>a sideswiped C-Class</i>

12:52.480 --> 12:55.024
<i>in the parking lot of a Farbucks</i>
<i>in Sherman Oaks.</i>

12:55.107 --> 12:56.984
And yeah, I'm saying Farbucks.

12:57.067 --> 13:00.613
It's an Armenian coffee shop
that used to be an old Togo's,

13:00.905 --> 13:02.907
that they just knocked off
the name Starbucks,

13:02.990 --> 13:04.408
without any repercussions too.

13:04.825 --> 13:06.952
<i>Nobody said anything to 'em</i>
<i>because, like I said,</i>

13:07.036 --> 13:08.788
<i>Armenian gangs are scary.</i>

13:08.871 --> 13:09.955
There he is.

13:10.956 --> 13:13.167
Why'd I agree
to wear this stupid camera shit, dude?

13:13.250 --> 13:15.544
Because you love your daughter
and you promised?

13:16.086 --> 13:19.340
Plus, if you're beat beyond recognition,
we'll be able to identify you.

13:19.423 --> 13:20.800
-What?
-[Joya] Nothing.

13:20.883 --> 13:24.136
[Kenya] <i>His name was Sarkis, and he was</i>
<i>everything I was afraid he'd be.</i>

13:24.261 --> 13:27.598
<i>Beautiful, slicked-back head of hair,</i>
<i>rayon-blend party shirt,</i>

13:27.681 --> 13:28.766
<i>chain on the outside,</i>

13:28.849 --> 13:31.352
leather jacket looked like
it had seen some-- some shit,

13:31.435 --> 13:33.771
<i>white athletic socks with Adidas sandals.</i>

13:33.854 --> 13:35.606
<i>And of course, a Gucci belt.</i>

13:36.649 --> 13:38.484
We knew that was gonna be there.

13:38.567 --> 13:40.861
Dude, you go get it.
Look, I'mma give you the money

13:40.945 --> 13:43.322
and you go deal with your boy
and, like, just bring the shit back.

13:43.405 --> 13:47.284
What? No. No, I only deal with Sarkis
if I absolutely have to.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.079
Does keeping your job
fall under that umbrella?

13:50.704 --> 13:54.250
Dude, the both of you are fucking pussies.
Fuck it, I'm gonna get the Molly.

13:54.333 --> 13:57.086
No! No. I'll-- I'll get the Molly.

13:57.336 --> 13:58.587
Anything can happen out there,

13:58.671 --> 14:00.631
you're not gonna leave me
with those six kids.

14:00.714 --> 14:02.925
I'd rather take my chances
with the drug dealer.

14:03.259 --> 14:04.552
[exhales]

14:07.471 --> 14:09.014
-Good luck.
-Shut up!

14:14.728 --> 14:18.190
So, um, if anything happened
to Kenya, um...

14:19.358 --> 14:21.527
would you still keep me on or...

14:24.947 --> 14:26.240
[Kenya] What's up? What's up, man?

14:26.323 --> 14:27.533
<i>There we were,</i>

14:27.616 --> 14:30.536
stereotype to stereotype,
just staring at each other in the face...

14:31.662 --> 14:32.872
letting life happen.

14:33.455 --> 14:34.915
What the fuck are you doing?

14:35.249 --> 14:37.001
-Get in the car.
-[Kenya] Oh, right.

14:37.418 --> 14:38.836
Sweet rocket, dude.

14:44.133 --> 14:45.676
Do you think he's tooled up?

14:46.385 --> 14:48.762
-[Danny] Like, does he have a screwdriver?
-Like, does he have a gun?

14:48.846 --> 14:50.764
Yeah! Probably, yes.

14:51.682 --> 14:54.935
I'll just leave the money right there
for you. That's yours.

14:58.105 --> 14:59.064
What's up, man?

15:00.608 --> 15:01.817
Sweet chain, dawg.

15:02.818 --> 15:03.819
Sweet.

15:08.032 --> 15:08.991
Okay.

15:09.783 --> 15:11.660
-[Danny] This is bad.
-[Joya] No, it's okay.

15:11.744 --> 15:12.578
[Danny] This is bad.

15:12.661 --> 15:14.455
[Joya] We just need to be out of here
in the next two minutes.

15:14.538 --> 15:16.123
[Danny] He's done.
We should get out of here.

15:16.206 --> 15:17.833
-Oh, you're the worst, Danny.
-I'm sorry.

15:30.262 --> 15:33.349
-[Danny] Oh, God. What's that in his hand?
-[Joya] This has got to happen fast.

15:34.141 --> 15:36.060
-[Danny] Oh, my God. Is that a knife?
-Thank you so much, sir.

15:36.143 --> 15:38.062
-[Joya] We gotta get outta here.
-God bless you. Goodnight.

15:38.145 --> 15:39.688
-[Danny] Get out of there.
-[Kenya] Be safe, please.

15:39.813 --> 15:40.981
[Joya] This is taking too long.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.983
-[car door slams]
-[Danny] Thank God. Get back here.

15:43.067 --> 15:44.693
[Joya] He's not equipped for this.

15:45.527 --> 15:48.364
-[Danny] Pretty smooth.
-[Joya] No, don't run. No. No.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.075
Be cool. Be cool! Don't wave.

15:51.867 --> 15:53.577
-[Kenya] Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
-[Danny] What?

15:53.661 --> 15:54.870
[Joya] What do you mean, "Go, go, go"?

15:54.995 --> 15:56.372
[vehicle starts] 

15:57.164 --> 15:59.959
I don't know if it's even real.
I gave him way too much money.

16:00.042 --> 16:01.877
-[Danny] Bye, Mr. Sarkis.
-[Joya] Please don't wave at him.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.629
-Don't wave at him.
-[Danny] Okay, sorry! Sorry!

16:06.465 --> 16:07.424
[sighs]

16:07.508 --> 16:09.301
It's our last time out, playboy.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.261
Our last big hurrah.

16:11.971 --> 16:15.140
End of a motherfucking era.
Been through some shit, dawg.

16:16.141 --> 16:17.226
Remember Coachella?

16:17.601 --> 16:19.436
Coachella '16 was...

16:19.812 --> 16:21.897
Babe, you think you can, um...

16:21.981 --> 16:24.775
help me find a t-shirt?
Something that really, like, pops.

16:24.858 --> 16:26.860
[Joya] You want me to help you
pick out a t-shirt?

16:26.944 --> 16:27.820
No, but I--

16:27.903 --> 16:29.363
[Joya] I think you got that.
You're grown man.

16:29.446 --> 16:31.657
You know what?
No, you're probably right.

16:31.740 --> 16:34.576
You'd probably pick out
some American Apparel bullshit.

16:34.702 --> 16:35.911
[cell phone chimes]

16:43.335 --> 16:44.253
Yo.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.088
What is this?

16:46.839 --> 16:47.923
-[Joya] Huh?
-Look at this.

16:48.298 --> 16:50.759
This is our pool,
in our backyard, with Chloe!

16:51.260 --> 16:53.178
Yeah, I told you
she was coming over today.

16:53.387 --> 16:54.680
You let her do this?

16:55.389 --> 16:59.059
Uh, I let our daughter swim in our pool.
You're right, you got me.

16:59.143 --> 17:01.270
It's not a joke, dude. She's in a bikini.

17:01.353 --> 17:03.397
This is basically a bra and panties.

17:03.480 --> 17:06.233
Except that it's made
specifically for swimming.

17:06.608 --> 17:08.777
Okay, everything's a joke, dude.

17:09.111 --> 17:11.947
Purple hair, bikini, on the Internet?

17:12.031 --> 17:14.324
People start seeing this shit,
what are they gonna say?

17:14.658 --> 17:17.703
You mean what are they gonna say about her
or what are they gonna say about you?

17:17.953 --> 17:21.081
Okay. All right, Jo,
just keep being that mom.

17:21.165 --> 17:24.209
Keep letting our family fall through
the cracks until we're nothing but crumbs.

17:24.293 --> 17:25.961
You'll be fine with it, but--
Great earrings.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.212
What are those, door-knockers?

17:27.296 --> 17:30.132
Why don't you take the next four hours
to pick out a t-shirt?

17:30.674 --> 17:32.092
We're not filming yet, right?

17:32.509 --> 17:34.053
Uh... no.

17:34.887 --> 17:38.223
Okay, good, because I didn't say anything,

17:38.307 --> 17:40.350
but Chloe forgot her bathing suit,

17:40.434 --> 17:43.854
which is why she was actually wearing
her bra and panties.

17:43.937 --> 17:45.314
Oh, my God!

17:45.689 --> 17:47.566
He would've never let you
live that one down.

17:47.649 --> 17:49.109
[Joya] I know, right?

17:49.359 --> 17:51.361
I just can't believe she posted it.

17:51.945 --> 17:56.075
Huh? But you liked it and then
you commented how cute she looked.

17:56.158 --> 17:57.576
Yeah, because I'm her mother,

17:57.659 --> 18:00.204
and I have to support her
no matter what she decides to wear.

18:00.287 --> 18:01.330
I'm a feminist.

18:01.455 --> 18:04.458
Plus, I was never gonna let your dad
think he was right.

18:09.588 --> 18:12.216
I'm a loving wife.
I care about my marriage,

18:12.549 --> 18:16.345

that you always double down.

18:16.428 --> 18:18.555
Okay? Even when things feel darkest,

18:19.098 --> 18:21.058

It is the only way
to keep the train on the tracks.

27:19.846 --> 27:22.182
and then put your money in that safe,

27:22.557 --> 27:25.101
and then you...

27:25.185 --> 27:28.855
Oh, yeah, and then just put a note
in the ledger here with how much you took

27:28.938 --> 27:30.065
and what you paid me.

27:30.148 --> 27:32.817
And if you're, like, a little bit short,
it's all good.

27:32.901 --> 27:35.320
-It's the Honor System.
-[Drea] Are you making this up?

27:35.403 --> 27:38.281
Because you don't have to.
I'm gonna-- I'm gonna blur your face.

27:38.365 --> 27:41.451
I'm not making this up.
That's how the Honor System works, right?

27:41.534 --> 27:44.996
[laughs] And you don't gotta blur my face!
Don't make it fucking weird.

27:45.997 --> 27:47.290
Where is this gonna show?

27:47.374 --> 27:49.542
[Kenya] Dude, what the fuck is up
with your generation?

27:49.626 --> 27:50.752
Are you guys lost?

27:51.127 --> 27:54.339
Buying drugs is supposed to be dangerous.
It's like an adventure.

27:54.464 --> 27:55.882
You're supposed to be terrified!

27:56.007 --> 27:59.135
Worried you're gonna get cross-bowed
or choked out by a Gucci belt.

27:59.844 --> 28:02.180
First, I let you down with my hair
and now this.

28:02.263 --> 28:04.557
Babe, you didn't let me down
with your hair.

28:04.891 --> 28:06.184
If I'm being honest,

28:06.559 --> 28:09.688
only reason any of this stuff counts
is because of fucking White Gaze.

28:09.771 --> 28:12.607
Okay, Dad,
homophobic does not seem like your brand.

28:12.691 --> 28:13.692
No, not gay--

28:14.818 --> 28:16.027
Bearby, look,

28:17.570 --> 28:20.240
I like your hair,
it's actually kind of cute.

28:20.323 --> 28:22.701
I mean, I don't love it, but I like it.

28:23.118 --> 28:26.037
You know, but the thing is,
as a black girl,

28:26.287 --> 28:29.499
you don't get looked at the same
as these white girls who have purple hair.

28:29.582 --> 28:32.293
You'll get looked at like
you're a stripper, or you're this or that.

28:32.377 --> 28:34.170
It's something totally different!

28:34.295 --> 28:35.922
It's like me with the fucking chain.

28:36.005 --> 28:37.924
You know how much I wanted this chain
growing up?

28:38.007 --> 28:40.510
All the dudes I idolized
had chains like this,

28:40.593 --> 28:43.763
whether they were ball players,
or rappers, or drug dealers.

28:44.097 --> 28:47.016
So when I finally was able to get one,
I was super pumped,

28:47.100 --> 28:49.936
until I noticed that white people
looked at me like I was a ball player,

28:50.019 --> 28:51.521
or a rapper, or a drug dealer.

28:51.604 --> 28:54.065
Okay, Dad,
you think I don't know that already?

28:54.149 --> 28:56.985
I mean, it's different for us,
but that's just how it is.

28:57.360 --> 29:01.406
Uh, it's like if Malia Obama
comes anywhere near pot,

29:01.489 --> 29:03.491
doing the same thing
any kid her age is doing,

29:03.575 --> 29:05.660
it's like a national security breach,

29:05.744 --> 29:09.539
or... or if Sasha wears a tank top,
it's like she breaks the Internet.

29:09.664 --> 29:13.251
You know, I feel like so few of us
get the chance to do anything

29:13.334 --> 29:15.044
that if we finally do get that chance,

29:15.128 --> 29:17.172
everyone's looking at us ready to pounce.

29:19.883 --> 29:22.385
Did you just compare yourself
to Sasha and Malia Obama?

29:23.803 --> 29:25.889
You really are such a dick.

29:26.264 --> 29:27.265
I know.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.060
-Thank you for telling me the truth.
-[Chloe] No problem.

29:31.895 --> 29:34.564

29:38.985 --> 29:40.653
[Chloe] So you really like my hair?

29:40.737 --> 29:43.615
[Kenya] I don't love your hair,
but it's kinda cute.

29:43.698 --> 29:45.325
[Chloe] Well, in that case,
I don't love your chain.

29:45.408 --> 29:46.326
[Kenya] What?

29:46.409 --> 29:49.120
[Chloe] Okay, but it does kinda look good
against the black sweatshirt.

29:49.245 --> 29:52.624
It does, right? Your mom wanted me to put,
like, a white t-shirt or something--

29:52.707 --> 29:55.043
-She's always on that bullshit.
-No, no.

29:55.126 --> 29:58.296
You know, I can't believe I'm gonna
say this, but you're kinda fly, old man.

29:58.379 --> 30:00.381
Thank you, that means everything.

30:00.465 --> 30:01.925
-[laughing]
-As it should.

30:02.008 --> 30:04.093
Question, were you high earlier?

30:04.761 --> 30:05.762
As fuck, yes.

30:05.845 --> 30:09.516
But I'm only telling you the truth
because we don't lie to each other, right?

30:09.599 --> 30:11.142
Then does that make it okay?

30:12.101 --> 30:13.853
For your father? Yes.

30:14.270 --> 30:16.564
But if you ever get high again,
I'm killing you.

30:17.232 --> 30:18.483
[Chloe laughs] Okay. 

30:18.566 --> 30:20.610
Uh, I'm gonna catch Kode.
Call me when you guys get home.

30:20.693 --> 30:22.403
Okay, well, we're gonna go, too.

30:22.695 --> 30:24.364
Nah, I think your night's over.

30:25.782 --> 30:29.118
Babe, you were right about White Gaze!

30:29.202 --> 30:32.413
Look at all these motherfuckers
looking at me like I'm crazy!

30:32.831 --> 30:33.790
You're crazy!

30:34.207 --> 30:35.708
You're just gonna watch this?

30:35.792 --> 30:39.087
Why do you even have an all-access pass?
Go do some drugs like your sister.

-Appreciate you.
-[Joya] Mm.

31:06.322 --> 31:08.408
Guess this is what they would say
the other side of White Gaze is.

31:08.491 --> 31:11.119
[Joya] Yep. Swim in our pool,
eat our fucking doughnuts,

You're never gonna be happy, are you?

-Probably not.

Thanks. Oh, don't fucking call me
