We are gonna dance
the sad right out of you.

17:06.917 --> 17:08.709
I was thinkin’ we start
with the Charleston,

17:08.709 --> 17:11.208
and then we just move
forward chronologically.

17:11.208 --> 17:12.750
And by the time you get to
the electric slide,

17:12.750 --> 17:14.542
you’re really gonna feel better

17:14.542 --> 17:16.959
because you’re
going to be bombed.

17:16.959 --> 17:19.417
Oh, I don’t know if anything
could make me feel any better.

17:19.417 --> 17:21.625
I’m just so sad
that it’s come to this.

17:21.625 --> 17:23.500
Well, I got a little
someone comin’

17:23.500 --> 17:25.792
who’s gonna make
you feel real good.

17:25.792 --> 17:27.000
HEATHER: Hey, what did you do?

17:27.000 --> 17:29.125
I didn’t do him,
but Colleen can.

17:29.125 --> 17:30.417
Did you get me a prostitute?

17:30.417 --> 17:31.709
What, no!

17:31.709 --> 17:32.792
What do you take me for?

17:32.792 --> 17:35.875
-No, he’s a dancer!
-Classy.

17:35.875 --> 17:38.625
But if you tip him enough,
he will have sex with you.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.500
-Oh, this is perfect!
-Yeah, it’s gonna be good.

17:40.500 --> 17:43.667
This could be just the thing
that makes Matt jealous

17:43.667 --> 17:46.667
that he’ll just come
<i>Running Man </i>back to you!

17:46.667 --> 17:48.083
-Jealous
JEN: Yeah, jealous.

17:48.083 --> 17:49.583
You guys haven’t
talked to Matt, have you?

17:49.583 --> 17:50.917
HEATHER: No way!
JEN: No, no.

17:50.917 --> 17:52.959
-Team Colleen!
-Hos before bros!

17:52.959 --> 17:54.333
I broke up with him.

17:54.333 --> 17:55.709
HEATHER: What’s that?
JEN: Shut the front door.

17:55.709 --> 17:57.000
JEN: You just said
you missed him.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.583
-I do.
HEATHER: Well, then,

17:58.583 --> 18:00.291
why did you break up
with him, Colleen,

18:00.291 --> 18:02.917
because Matt’s a great guy.

18:02.917 --> 18:04.583
I got scared.

Matt fits into some really bad
