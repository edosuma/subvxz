22:45.156 --> 22:46.365
What a pity.

32:29.740 --> 32:33.077
Papa has to go to work my dear.

33:14.785 --> 33:16.870
Who wants to kill you?

33:18.622 --> 33:21.834
A single insect may bring
down an entire country.

33:21.959 --> 33:24.086
Which insect wants to kill you today ?

33:24.211 --> 33:26.338
I don't know, but I intend to find out.

35:27.709 --> 35:30.629
- Is this my speech?
- Yes.

35:38.762 --> 35:39.930
Is the lighting okay?

35:40.055 --> 35:42.808
The lighting is perfect, Jefe.

35:42.933 --> 35:44.476
Thank you, General.

35:49.940 --> 35:51.984
Your phone is ringing, El Jefe.

35:57.573 --> 35:58.740
Hello?

35:58.866 --> 35:59.783
Jorge,

35:59.908 --> 36:01.159
Nephew!

36:01.285 --> 36:02.786
Uncle?

36:02.911 --> 36:04.288
Correct!

36:05.372 --> 36:07.791
I'm out here walking through the jungle !

36:07.916 --> 36:09.293
How are you?

36:09.418 --> 36:10.544
All good?

36:13.755 --> 36:14.798
How are you, Uncle?

36:14.923 --> 36:16.300
I'm fantastic!

36:16.425 --> 36:17.968
I'm walking through the jungle

36:18.093 --> 36:20.137
with an absolutely lovely woman.

36:20.262 --> 36:22.139
- The Gringo Journalist?
- Yes!

36:22.264 --> 36:24.016
The beautiful Claire Wellington.

37:10.562 --> 37:13.190
Yes, yes, don't worry.
See you soon!

37:15.400 --> 37:16.902
We were all worried for you.

37:17.027 --> 37:20.030
Sure. Great. God bless you!

37:24.159 --> 37:25.911
My uncle isn't dead.

37:28.872 --> 37:30.916
Our partners will not be pleased.

49:05.735 --> 49:07.028
Thank you for your help.

49:09.489 --> 49:11.449
You're welcome, Mr. Pettits.

54:21.258 --> 54:23.594
You're much more beautiful than on TV.

54:26.222 --> 54:27.181
The Hulk.

54:27.723 --> 54:29.183
The Hulk scares me.

57:56.807 --> 57:59.059
My promise, and my legacy

57:59.185 --> 58:01.562
is that wealth from these metals

58:01.687 --> 58:04.064
will be invested solely and exclusively

58:04.190 --> 58:07.109
to enrich the people of Paldonia.

58:07.234 --> 58:08.527
Long Live Paldonia!

01:09:06.393 --> 01:09:07.310
I said,

01:09:07.435 --> 01:09:09.938
Where is President Venegas?

01:09:13.984 --> 01:09:14.776
I said,

01:09:14.901 --> 01:09:16.987
Where is President Venegas?

01:09:21.283 --> 01:09:23.660
Where is President Venegas?

01:09:39.551 --> 01:09:41.261
This is your car?

01:19:59.712 --> 01:20:01.881
- You're alive Papi!
- I am!

01:20:02.006 --> 01:20:03.549
It's good to see you.

01:20:03.674 --> 01:20:05.259
It was not my men who attacked you.

01:20:05.384 --> 01:20:06.552
I know, I know.

01:20:06.677 --> 01:20:08.638
- Espresso?
- Naturally.

01:20:10.348 --> 01:20:11.432
Who is this?

01:22:46.170 --> 01:22:47.797
Keep her there.

01:23:41.976 --> 01:23:44.311
Bring the princess out of the car.

01:26:37.651 --> 01:26:38.986
Uncle!

01:26:42.323 --> 01:26:44.158
I am not here to hurt you.

01:27:31.747 --> 01:27:33.999
Mr. President.

01:27:34.124 --> 01:27:36.085
Alive and kicking!

01:27:37.628 --> 01:27:39.088
So I see.

01:28:22.089 --> 01:28:23.424
You're okay! You're okay!

01:28:23.549 --> 01:28:24.800
You're okay!

01:28:28.303 --> 01:28:31.056
Uncle...

01:28:33.183 --> 01:28:34.143
Uncle...

01:28:35.728 --> 01:28:37.688
They killed... me.

01:28:41.191 --> 01:28:43.485
I'm s-- I'm sorry.

01:29:19.438 --> 01:29:20.647
Surrender!

01:29:22.274 --> 01:29:23.859
Soldiers!

01:29:23.984 --> 01:29:27.112
I know you are obeying orders.

01:29:27.988 --> 01:29:29.448
My children...

01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:32.451
You don't have to do this.

01:29:33.452 --> 01:29:35.412
My brothers.

01:29:35.537 --> 01:29:39.166
You can change the destiny of this country.

01:29:39.291 --> 01:29:41.376
Not for me.

01:29:41.502 --> 01:29:43.587
But for you.

01:29:45.422 --> 01:29:47.424
For your mothers.

01:29:47.549 --> 01:29:49.426
For your fathers.

01:29:51.053 --> 01:29:53.180
For your children.

01:29:53.305 --> 01:29:56.266
This country has bled for too long.

01:29:56.391 --> 01:29:58.894
This madness has to end.

01:30:06.235 --> 01:30:08.153
Now is the time to fight...

01:30:08.278 --> 01:30:11.990
Fight... for this land.

01:30:16.453 --> 01:30:17.704
My brothers.

01:30:17.830 --> 01:30:19.248
Defend

01:30:19.373 --> 01:30:21.125
your homeland.

01:32:49.356 --> 01:32:51.024
Mr. Venegas?

01:32:53.735 --> 01:32:55.654
Mr. President?

01:32:56.238 --> 01:32:57.572
Yes...

01:37:54.536 --> 01:37:55.996
Nice to meet you...

01:37:56.121 --> 01:37:57.622
I think.
