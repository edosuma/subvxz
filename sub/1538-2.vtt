00:24.958 --> 00:27.026
(rooster crows in distance)

00:39.139 --> 00:41.874
(indistinct
conversations, laughter)

00:46.646 --> 00:48.514
(over radio):
¶ I saw you last evening

00:48.516 --> 00:50.816
¶ standing up against a tree

00:50.818 --> 00:52.818
(honky-tonk piano playing)

00:52.820 --> 00:57.056
¶ I saw you last evening,
standing up against a tree ¶

00:58.992 --> 00:59.992
¶ I heard you say
you was sick... ¶

00:59.994 --> 01:01.393
Thank you.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.429
¶ but you looked like
you strong to me... ¶

01:04.197 --> 01:05.664
(giggling)

01:05.666 --> 01:07.232
¶ well, your hat
was on backwards ¶

01:07.234 --> 01:09.568
¶ and your clothes
were comin' off of you ¶

01:11.504 --> 01:12.905
¶ well, your hat was on--

01:12.907 --> 01:14.506
Paul: Hey, I was
listening to that.

01:14.508 --> 01:15.908
Announcer:
...The town of jupiter

01:15.910 --> 01:18.043
Is in the grips of terror
for a second week,

01:18.045 --> 01:21.013
From four unsolved murders
and a child who remains missing.

01:21.015 --> 01:22.414
Schools stand like mausoleums,

01:22.416 --> 01:24.016
Their attendance
drastically declined,

01:24.018 --> 01:26.051
As parents keep their children
safely home.

01:26.053 --> 01:28.120
(siren wailing)

01:31.191 --> 01:33.592
Carol:
Surprised to see you here.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.027
Nobody else seems to be open.

01:35.029 --> 01:38.030
Mr. Hanley says
it's business as usual.

01:38.032 --> 01:41.200
Even though we haven't
seen a customer for days.

01:41.202 --> 01:42.434
Announcer: And we have learned,
though this report

01:42.436 --> 01:43.602
Has not yet been confirmed,

01:43.604 --> 01:45.070
That one of their own,

01:45.072 --> 01:46.872
Possibly a jupiter
police detective,

01:46.874 --> 01:49.108
Has himself been missing
for two days.

01:49.110 --> 01:51.276
Reliable sources
in the police department

01:51.278 --> 01:53.112
Have circulated
the clarion cry that,

01:53.114 --> 01:55.114
"no stone will be left unturned.

01:55.116 --> 01:57.716
The boys in blue
are out for blood."

01:57.718 --> 01:59.918
(siren continues wailing)

01:59.920 --> 02:01.987
(siren stops)

02:06.759 --> 02:08.293
Announcer: This news report
is brought to you...

02:08.295 --> 02:09.895
(radio clicks off)

02:09.897 --> 02:10.929
Jimmy:
You take care of the body

02:10.931 --> 02:11.997
Like we talked about?

02:28.414 --> 02:29.982
Jesus.

02:29.984 --> 02:31.950
Who's the proprietor
of this, uh,

02:31.952 --> 02:34.419
Freak show?

02:34.421 --> 02:36.255
You're looking for elsa mars.

02:36.257 --> 02:38.490
That's her tent, right there.

02:39.792 --> 02:41.293
Elsa:
We have nothing to hide.

02:41.295 --> 02:42.594
But I cannot allow you

02:42.596 --> 02:45.097
To look around
without a search warrant.

02:45.099 --> 02:48.300
My monsters cherish
their privacy.

02:48.302 --> 02:50.836
You can see
all we have to offer...

02:52.805 --> 02:54.106
...With a ticket
to the show.

02:54.108 --> 02:55.174
There ain't gonna be
any show tonight,

02:55.176 --> 02:56.308
Or anytime soon.

02:56.310 --> 02:58.010
We're setting up a curfew.

02:58.012 --> 03:00.312
This town is shutting
down at night

03:00.314 --> 03:01.813
Till the killer's caught.

03:01.815 --> 03:03.182
A curfew?

03:03.184 --> 03:04.816
You are going to ruin
my business.

03:04.818 --> 03:07.853
Every dark cloud has
a silver lining.

03:10.123 --> 03:12.191
Colquitt:
Ah...

03:12.193 --> 03:15.027
Our famous

03:15.029 --> 03:16.128
Vanishing patient.

03:16.130 --> 03:19.364
Or is it... Patients?

03:19.366 --> 03:21.133
Elsa:
They left the hospital

03:21.135 --> 03:23.135
For the same reason
anyone does:

03:23.137 --> 03:26.138
They're weren't ill anymore.

03:26.140 --> 03:28.140
Did you expect them
to move in?

03:28.142 --> 03:30.008
We like to get statements
from anyone involved

03:30.010 --> 03:31.643
In a murder investigation.

03:31.645 --> 03:32.811
Elsa:
They gave their statement.

03:32.813 --> 03:33.879
To the other
policeman.

03:33.881 --> 03:34.980
I was there
when they did.

03:34.982 --> 03:37.049
He told us,
off the record,

03:37.051 --> 03:38.884
That their story
had the trademark

03:38.886 --> 03:40.819
Of the other killings.

03:40.821 --> 03:44.189
He did seem...
Drunk, though.

03:44.191 --> 03:46.124
I agree with miss mars.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.860
I smelled whiskey.

03:48.862 --> 03:50.662
Colquitt: He never mentioned
that statement to us.

03:50.664 --> 03:52.698
And now he's missing.

03:52.700 --> 03:55.033
Hmm. Will you arrest us
for that, too?

03:55.035 --> 03:56.401
His disappearance?

03:56.403 --> 03:58.036
(quiet laugh)

03:58.038 --> 04:00.339
We're such easy targets,
aren't we?

04:00.341 --> 04:02.507
We're not arresting
anyone for anything.

04:02.509 --> 04:04.009
Yet.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.510
We got a stack of murders

04:05.512 --> 04:07.346
And a missing cop, though,

04:07.348 --> 04:09.915
So expect to get to know us.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.361
(latch rattling)

04:22.363 --> 04:24.296
(door bell jingles)

04:25.865 --> 04:28.433
Mr. Hanley, got your coffee.

04:35.908 --> 04:37.776
M-mr. Hanley?

04:49.956 --> 04:51.290
Mr. Hanley!

05:08.975 --> 05:10.842
(sudden whirring)

05:28.795 --> 05:30.862
(quiet footsteps)

06:03.996 --> 06:06.198
¶

06:28.187 --> 06:29.788
(quiet gasp)

06:34.660 --> 06:38.063
(growling, shuddering)

06:38.065 --> 06:39.064
(blade scrapes, body thuds)

06:39.066 --> 06:41.400
(growls)

07:48.968 --> 07:51.570
(jaunty swing music playing)

07:51.572 --> 07:53.538
(laughter, lively conversations)

07:55.408 --> 07:58.109
Pepper: Kill the copper!
Kill the copper!

07:58.111 --> 08:00.245
Kill the copper!
Kill the copper!

08:00.247 --> 08:02.481
¶

08:02.483 --> 08:05.116
All: Kill the copper!
Kill the copper!

08:05.118 --> 08:08.119
Kill the copper!
Kill him dead!

08:08.121 --> 08:10.755
¶

08:10.757 --> 08:11.923
(chanting continues):
Kill the copper!

08:11.925 --> 08:12.958
Kill the copper!
Kill the copper!

08:12.960 --> 08:13.992
Drink up, jimmy!

08:13.994 --> 08:15.427
It's your victory cup!

08:15.429 --> 08:17.796
(chanting continues)

08:17.798 --> 08:19.831
Shut... Up!

08:26.973 --> 08:29.541
(jimmy grunting)

08:35.348 --> 08:38.016
I'm sorry I snapped.

08:39.785 --> 08:42.287
I never killed nobody before.

08:42.289 --> 08:43.989
What if he has a family,

08:43.991 --> 08:46.625
A couple kids,
wondering where he is?

08:46.627 --> 08:49.361
I know what it's like
to grow up without a father.

08:49.363 --> 08:51.696
Amazon eve: Are we gonna
return the body parts

08:51.698 --> 08:53.365
Back to the family?

08:53.367 --> 08:55.967
Jimmy: No. We're gonna
burn these body parts,

08:55.969 --> 08:59.037
And we're gonna scatter
the ashes as far as we can.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.372
Cops are already
sniffing around.

09:00.374 --> 09:01.439
(body thudding)

09:03.042 --> 09:04.643
I'm sorry, guys.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.011
I wanted to protect us

09:06.013 --> 09:08.146
And instead, I created
a shit-storm of trouble.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.548
You had no other choice.

09:09.550 --> 09:11.049
He was gonna take
the twins away.

09:13.185 --> 09:16.655
He called us freaks.

09:16.657 --> 09:18.089
I hate that word.

09:19.825 --> 09:22.160
Jimmy:
They don't even know us.

09:22.162 --> 09:23.695
If they just got to know us,

09:23.697 --> 09:25.230
They would see we're
just like them.

09:25.232 --> 09:28.867
No better, no worse, just...

09:28.869 --> 09:30.936
Regular people.

09:32.505 --> 09:34.139
That's what
we gotta do...

09:36.042 --> 09:38.910
...Let 'em know us.

09:38.912 --> 09:42.013
Hey... Look what I found.

09:42.015 --> 09:43.248
I don't think it'll burn.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.083
Maybe it'll melt.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.421
Good catch, evie.

09:49.423 --> 09:50.956
I'll take care of that.

09:58.030 --> 10:01.299
(quiet pinging)

10:30.096 --> 10:32.964
(pinging continues)

10:51.751 --> 10:52.984
(pinging stops as bell jingles)

11:11.937 --> 11:13.505
Snails?

11:13.507 --> 11:14.939
(sighs)

11:14.941 --> 11:16.775
How boring.

11:16.777 --> 11:19.511
That's what you
ordered-- escargot.

11:19.513 --> 11:20.945
Like you had in paris.
(laughs)

11:20.947 --> 11:22.947
Oh...!

11:22.949 --> 11:25.784
Dora went to a lot of trouble.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.318
Don't you make a sour face.

11:27.320 --> 11:30.088
(quietly): That boy's
working my last nerve.

11:36.962 --> 11:38.930
(young man sighs)

11:43.469 --> 11:45.970
You can't live on sweets
and cognac, dandy.

11:45.972 --> 11:48.540
It's bad for
the temperament.

11:48.542 --> 11:50.175
I'm still having nightmares

11:50.177 --> 11:51.643
About the debacle with
the cushing girl--

11:51.645 --> 11:53.812
I told you
a million trillion times,

11:53.814 --> 11:55.647
I did not touch her.

11:55.649 --> 11:57.982
She was just miffed
'cause I said

11:57.984 --> 11:59.818
She reminded me of
the pregnant hippo

11:59.820 --> 12:01.553
We saw on safari.
Damn lucky for both of us.

12:01.555 --> 12:03.988
Police chief pringle was
a high school beau of mine.

12:03.990 --> 12:05.557
(scoffs)

12:05.559 --> 12:07.992
All those charming girls
I've introduced you to.

12:07.994 --> 12:09.327
They're all smelly cows.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.995
But what about a grandbaby?

12:10.997 --> 12:12.530
It'd be such fun for us!

12:12.532 --> 12:13.832
Never!

12:13.834 --> 12:16.468
Babies are more
boring than anything.

12:18.537 --> 12:20.839
I want to be
a thespian.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.741
But you keep ruining it.

12:22.743 --> 12:24.242
It's not our world, dandy.

12:24.244 --> 12:28.847
You come from a long line
of such fine people--

12:28.849 --> 12:31.549
Generation after generation
of refinement.

12:31.551 --> 12:33.051
I am simply protecting you

12:33.053 --> 12:36.054
From a life of degradation
and opprobrium!

12:36.056 --> 12:39.090
I'm turning to dust
from boredom.

12:40.092 --> 12:41.693
Where are you going?

12:41.695 --> 12:45.029
I don't know--
maybe st. Petersburg,

12:45.031 --> 12:46.865
Where they have
real caramel corn,

12:46.867 --> 12:50.869
Not that cardboard they sell
at the freak show.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.103
Oh, stay, darling!

12:52.105 --> 12:53.538
Stay with mother.

12:53.540 --> 12:54.606
We'll play
June allyson paper dolls,

12:54.608 --> 12:56.875
Or whatever you'd like!

12:56.877 --> 13:00.211
Something ghastly always happens
when you run off in a mood!

13:00.213 --> 13:02.046
(door slams in distance)
miss gloria...

13:02.048 --> 13:05.283
I have some bad news.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.887
I found some of those, uh,
parts... Behind the tool shed.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.622
There was some
fur and teeth,

13:10.624 --> 13:12.624
And neighbors been
stopping by all day,

13:12.626 --> 13:15.126
Looking for their cat.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.562
And people have been
disappearing all over town.

13:17.564 --> 13:19.831
Dandy had nothing
to do with that.

13:21.400 --> 13:24.135
He's just bored.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.753
What are you two loafers
doing out here?

13:41.755 --> 13:43.922
(sighs)
get up!

13:43.924 --> 13:45.757
It's time to go
work on your act.

13:45.759 --> 13:47.492
We're not performers.

13:47.494 --> 13:48.827
Speak for yourself.

13:48.829 --> 13:51.496
Around here,
we sing for our supper.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.665
(car approaching)

13:58.938 --> 14:01.773
Christ on a wheel...

14:01.775 --> 14:03.174
Dot:
Who's that?

14:04.276 --> 14:07.178
Somebody I used to know.

14:36.475 --> 14:40.044
Please tell me
this is a rest stop.

14:40.046 --> 14:41.312
As far
as we're concerned,

14:41.314 --> 14:44.315
This might as well be
the garden of eden.

14:44.317 --> 14:47.151
So said the snake.

14:47.153 --> 14:49.153
Elsa: This ad
was placed months ago.

14:49.155 --> 14:52.156
Well, we had to close out
our midwest engagement

14:52.158 --> 14:54.192
Before we could get down here.

14:54.194 --> 14:56.394
You were with the giuseppe
brothers of chicago,

14:56.396 --> 14:57.562
You say?

14:57.564 --> 14:58.997
Last six years.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.698
Dell toledo...

15:00.700 --> 15:02.400
The stupendous strong man!

15:02.402 --> 15:04.002
You probably heard of me.

15:04.004 --> 15:06.237
I got a honey
of an escape act.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.505
I studied under hardeen,

15:07.507 --> 15:08.907
Harry houdini's younger brother.

15:08.909 --> 15:10.174
Truly.

15:10.176 --> 15:11.242
Three sold-out
shows a night,

15:11.244 --> 15:12.577
Two matinees every
weekend.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.379
I was a smash in
the windy city.

15:14.381 --> 15:17.916
But the real star of our family
is my wife here.

15:17.918 --> 15:19.984
Desiree.

15:21.587 --> 15:24.088
Those greasy giuseppe brothers
never understood that.

15:24.090 --> 15:27.058
They had her opening up
for some lousy animal acts.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.527
(groans) I couldn't stand
the stink of it.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.362
So I loaded up our caravan

15:31.364 --> 15:34.265
And I took my girl
out of there.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.034
Yours...

15:36.036 --> 15:37.835
Is a true love story.

15:39.038 --> 15:41.272
Yes, it really is.

15:44.710 --> 15:47.378
Hey, what the hell
are you two fruits
doing around here?

15:47.380 --> 15:49.447
We're waiting
for our friend.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.049
He's inside.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.450
He thinks he can
change his stripes.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.652
How's he figure
he's gonna do that?

15:57.723 --> 15:59.057
Ah, ah, ah, oh!
(man crying)

15:59.059 --> 16:02.260
That's it, baby.
Right there.

16:02.262 --> 16:05.730
Aw, that's okay,
baby boy.

16:05.732 --> 16:07.432
There ain't no
need to cry.

16:07.434 --> 16:09.067
Desiree's got you.

16:09.069 --> 16:10.068
Martin was right.

16:10.070 --> 16:11.903
You're a miracle worker.

16:11.905 --> 16:13.938
(laughs)
you're my salvation.

16:13.940 --> 16:16.307
I never dreamed
that I would ever be able

16:16.309 --> 16:18.609
To do this with a real woman.

16:18.611 --> 16:21.579
Maybe now I can have a wife.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.114
A family.

16:23.116 --> 16:24.916
A normal life.

16:24.918 --> 16:27.118
Oh, now, let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.587
Let's get you
to come first.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.622
You want me to use my extra bit

16:31.624 --> 16:33.624
Of business to get you there?

16:33.626 --> 16:36.260
That's my wife!

16:36.262 --> 16:38.429
My wife!
Dell!

16:38.431 --> 16:41.265
Elsa:
The world of carny folk
is small, mr. Toledo.

16:41.267 --> 16:43.001
I've heard tales
of a strongman

16:43.003 --> 16:44.102
With a temper.

16:44.104 --> 16:45.937
And murder.

16:45.939 --> 16:49.107
There ain't murder
if there ain't no body.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.109
And ain't no chicago police
gonna drag his ass

16:51.111 --> 16:52.844
All the way down
to this swamp

16:52.846 --> 16:54.112
On account
of some dead poof.

16:54.114 --> 16:55.179
(laughs)

16:55.181 --> 16:57.515
They're lower than us freaks.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.851
"us freaks"?

17:06.959 --> 17:08.459
Three titties,

17:08.461 --> 17:11.996
Proper girl parts
and a ding-a-ling.

17:11.998 --> 17:14.132
I'm a full blown
hermaphrodite.

17:14.134 --> 17:16.100
Put that on your banner.

17:17.302 --> 17:20.138
My word.
(laughs)

17:20.140 --> 17:22.040
What does that make you?

17:22.042 --> 17:25.043
The happiest man on earth.

17:26.045 --> 17:29.514
You are an enchanting couple.

17:29.516 --> 17:31.215
But the position is filled.

17:31.217 --> 17:34.218
To be frank,
business is slow

17:34.220 --> 17:36.487
These days.
I couldn't afford

17:36.489 --> 17:39.557
A couple of your renown.

17:43.495 --> 17:46.064
You put a contract
in front of me

17:46.066 --> 17:48.032
For whatever you think is fair,
and I will sign it.

17:48.034 --> 17:50.735
The truth is you...

17:50.737 --> 17:51.903
You're our last stop.

17:51.905 --> 17:54.072
You said it before.

17:54.074 --> 17:55.673
The world
of carny folk is small.

17:55.675 --> 17:58.009
Well, it's smaller
than you know.

17:58.011 --> 18:00.912
We're a vanishing breed.

18:00.914 --> 18:02.213
You turn us away,

18:02.215 --> 18:05.183
There's no place left
for us to go.

18:05.185 --> 18:08.886
Show me your hands.

18:08.888 --> 18:10.688
What, are you gonna
read my future?

18:10.690 --> 18:12.023
Your past.

18:12.025 --> 18:13.791
Come on, show me.

18:23.202 --> 18:25.069
Strong hands.

18:25.071 --> 18:26.771
Calloused.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.873
And not afraid of hard work.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.441
Not afraid of anything.

18:32.044 --> 18:33.377
Maybe what this place needs

18:33.379 --> 18:36.047
Is a strong male presence.

18:36.049 --> 18:38.282
Do you bark?

18:38.284 --> 18:41.853
Hell, I'll even howl
if you like.

18:43.388 --> 18:45.456
(short laugh)

18:48.227 --> 18:49.760
¶ kiss me sweeter...

18:49.762 --> 18:51.896
(woman sings in italian)

18:51.898 --> 18:53.064
¶ hold me tighter...

18:53.066 --> 18:55.800
(woman sings response
in italian)

18:55.802 --> 18:56.901
¶ say you love me

18:56.903 --> 18:59.103
(woman sings in italian)

18:59.105 --> 19:01.239
Both (harmonizing):
¶ say it just to me

19:01.241 --> 19:04.809
(man and woman
harmonize in italian)

19:16.588 --> 19:19.790
Excuse me? Excuse me!

19:19.792 --> 19:22.126
Clown?

19:22.128 --> 19:24.095
Do you do private parties?

19:24.097 --> 19:26.531
For children?

19:30.936 --> 19:34.472
I'll pay you handsomely for it.

19:34.474 --> 19:37.275
My son's been
a little down in the dumps.

19:37.277 --> 19:39.844
Maybe you can cheer him up.

19:52.791 --> 19:54.959
Well, it ain't bad,
but the kids,

19:54.961 --> 19:57.195
They really like those prizes
that come in the boxed stuff.

19:57.197 --> 19:59.297
That's because they
haven't tasted this!

19:59.299 --> 20:01.299
Listen, I know that's
not why you're here.

20:01.301 --> 20:03.134
You got a thing
for the twins.

20:03.136 --> 20:05.036
Look, I don't judge, okay?
I get it, you know?

20:05.038 --> 20:07.038
You see a piece of tail,
you just got to have it.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.507
But us guys, we don't always
think with our brains.

20:09.509 --> 20:11.509
It's not about the twins!

20:11.511 --> 20:14.645
It's about me.

20:14.647 --> 20:17.048
I'd like to join the show.

20:17.050 --> 20:18.849
I've had an epiphany.

20:18.851 --> 20:22.153
I truly believe
this is where I belong.

20:22.155 --> 20:23.988
I've been ruminating

20:23.990 --> 20:27.892
On my life and what I want.

20:27.894 --> 20:30.895
This is the perfect place
for me.

20:30.897 --> 20:34.031
Well, unless you got pony legs
under those trousers

20:34.033 --> 20:35.666
Or a double ding dong...

20:35.668 --> 20:39.170
No, but I do know
the entire cole porter canon.

20:39.172 --> 20:41.672
Listen.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.207
You ain't the first kid

20:43.209 --> 20:45.243
Who wants to run away
and join the circus.

20:45.245 --> 20:47.044
You got dreams of the lights.

20:47.046 --> 20:49.180
But trust me.

20:49.182 --> 20:50.681
It's nothing like you'd imagine.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.917
You wouldn't last one day here.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.685
You don't know me!

20:54.687 --> 20:55.853
What you're looking at--

20:55.855 --> 20:58.189
That's not who I am inside.

20:58.191 --> 21:00.258
I'm one of you.

21:01.927 --> 21:04.395
I'll prove it.

21:04.397 --> 21:07.265
Please!
Just take a chance on me!

21:07.267 --> 21:10.067
You'd be saving my life.

21:10.069 --> 21:12.036
You know what I
wouldn't give to have

21:12.038 --> 21:13.704
Real hands like yours?

21:13.706 --> 21:16.907
To be able to touch a girl
without scaring her?

21:16.909 --> 21:19.543
From where I'm sitting
you got the world on a string.

21:19.545 --> 21:22.079
So, you go home
to your mansion on the hill,

21:22.081 --> 21:25.116
And you thank god
for all you got.

21:25.118 --> 21:27.952
Now scram!

21:27.954 --> 21:29.954
I got to sweep a tent.

21:41.900 --> 21:42.933
Dandy:
<i>I hate you! I hate you!</i>

21:42.935 --> 21:44.735
I hate you!
I hate you! I hate you!

21:44.737 --> 21:48.039
I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you! I hate you...

22:02.988 --> 22:05.156
You'd better eat
something, miss mott.

22:05.158 --> 22:07.124
Your ulcer's gonna
start acting up.

22:07.126 --> 22:08.092
(door opens)
he's home!

22:08.094 --> 22:10.661
Dandy's home!

22:14.299 --> 22:16.467
Leave me alone, mother.

22:16.469 --> 22:20.104
I have a surprise for you!
Something you've always wanted!

22:20.106 --> 22:21.806
What happened to you?

22:21.808 --> 22:23.441
I hate it here.

22:23.443 --> 22:24.975
I hate this house.

22:24.977 --> 22:26.777
I hate my life.

22:26.779 --> 22:28.312
I hate you, mother!

22:28.314 --> 22:30.948
Nonsense, you just need
a little companionship.

22:30.950 --> 22:32.683
Maybe a new friend.

22:36.154 --> 22:38.189
Are your eyes closed?

22:38.191 --> 22:39.323
Don't be stupid.

22:39.325 --> 22:40.624
Let me in.

22:40.626 --> 22:41.959
(laughs)
it's a clown.

22:41.961 --> 22:43.961
Your very own clown!

22:43.963 --> 22:45.996
You can do whatever
you want with him!

22:45.998 --> 22:48.065
I'll leave you two alone.

23:20.499 --> 23:22.566
(low snarling)

23:25.670 --> 23:27.972
(flies buzzing)

23:57.369 --> 24:01.005
¶

24:09.114 --> 24:11.449
Well, I'll be dammed.

24:11.451 --> 24:14.118
If it ain't
old honest abe herself.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.420
Ethel, you look good.

24:16.422 --> 24:17.955
How's the old soup catcher?

24:17.957 --> 24:20.391
I would've expected to see
some gray in it by now.

24:20.393 --> 24:22.226
You been dyeing it?
You can tell me.
Let's cut

24:22.228 --> 24:23.928
The chitchat.
I won't be here long.

24:23.930 --> 24:25.763
And here's a news flash:

24:25.765 --> 24:27.298
You won't be either.

24:27.300 --> 24:30.568
Whatever your story is,
you're not welcome here.

24:30.570 --> 24:33.771
You stay away from my jimmy.

24:33.773 --> 24:36.807
Jimmy who?

24:36.809 --> 24:38.576
(baby crying)
shut up!

24:38.578 --> 24:40.945
You know what?
Life's rough, kid.

24:40.947 --> 24:43.581
Especially for a mistake
like you.

24:43.583 --> 24:46.250
I'm gonna save you
a lot of pain.

24:46.252 --> 24:47.985
I never want
to see you ever again.

24:47.987 --> 24:51.088
You say one word to my boy,

24:51.090 --> 24:53.123
You get anywhere near him,

24:53.125 --> 24:55.926
And my freaks will tear you
limb from limb.

24:55.928 --> 24:57.428
(laughs)

24:57.430 --> 24:59.330
Believe me, I didn't
come here for that kid.

24:59.332 --> 25:02.099
And I sure as hell
didn't come here for you.

25:02.101 --> 25:04.301
I'm married now.

25:04.303 --> 25:06.504
She's a real lady.

25:06.506 --> 25:08.472
And a star.

25:08.474 --> 25:11.108
You wouldn't know a real lady
from a goat's ass.

25:11.110 --> 25:13.944
You sure that's the way you want
to address your new boss?

25:13.946 --> 25:15.613
You'll never be my boss.

25:15.615 --> 25:17.681
She put me in charge
of the whole place.

25:17.683 --> 25:19.950
Your-your friend miss elsa.

25:19.952 --> 25:23.020
I simply pointed out
security around this place

25:23.022 --> 25:24.455
Is a little lax.

25:24.457 --> 25:26.357
You wouldn't want
nothing wandering in

25:26.359 --> 25:28.993
Or wandering out.

25:28.995 --> 25:32.530
You are aware there's a vicious
killer abroad in the land?

25:37.869 --> 25:39.937
(door slams)

25:46.645 --> 25:50.981
(off-key):
¶ when I'm calling you...

25:50.983 --> 25:55.052
¶ will you answer to...?

25:55.054 --> 25:57.488
<i>Nein!</i> Stop! Halt!

25:57.490 --> 26:00.658
You make my teeth ache.
You're flat.

26:00.660 --> 26:02.359
I'm sorry.
I'm a little nervous.

26:02.361 --> 26:04.495
A little tone deaf.
Yeah.

26:04.497 --> 26:06.931
Come on, we try
again, come on.

26:10.001 --> 26:13.003
(off-key):
¶ when I'm calling you...

26:13.005 --> 26:14.004
(elsa speaks german)

26:14.006 --> 26:16.073
Please, no more.

26:16.075 --> 26:18.342
I thought you said you could
sing? I'm going to have

26:18.344 --> 26:19.910
To find something else
for you to do.

26:19.912 --> 26:21.011
Bette:
Like what?

26:21.013 --> 26:23.581
Uh, juggling. Doesn't matter.

26:23.583 --> 26:25.749
What? What do you mean
it "doesn't matter"?

26:25.751 --> 26:28.018
They're our headliners!

26:28.020 --> 26:29.720
Hardly that!

26:29.722 --> 26:30.888
They are my warm-up act.

26:30.890 --> 26:32.523
It doesn't matter

26:32.525 --> 26:33.524
That they're good.

26:33.526 --> 26:35.693
They have two heads.

26:35.695 --> 26:37.094
Bette:
Please, miss elsa.

26:37.096 --> 26:39.063
We don't want
to just stand here

26:39.065 --> 26:41.899
And be stared at.
It's embarrassing.

26:41.901 --> 26:44.068
Me and dell?

26:44.070 --> 26:47.104
Uh, we saw this act
down in mexico.

26:47.106 --> 26:49.373
This senorita, could shoot

26:49.375 --> 26:51.875
Ping pong balls
right out of her...

26:51.877 --> 26:55.212
(popping)

26:55.214 --> 26:56.914
What?

26:56.916 --> 26:59.283
At least I'm trying
to come up with something.

26:59.285 --> 27:00.951
What about dot?

27:00.953 --> 27:02.920
Dot doesn't have any talent.

27:02.922 --> 27:05.089
That's true.

27:05.091 --> 27:08.225
I don't even know that song.

27:08.227 --> 27:10.060
So sing something else.

27:10.062 --> 27:12.563
Whatever you want.

27:12.565 --> 27:15.399
Sing it to me.

27:15.401 --> 27:18.902
No. Pretend like nobody's here.
Just me.

27:18.904 --> 27:21.572
Go on.

27:21.574 --> 27:23.674
Give it a try.

27:36.621 --> 27:41.925
¶ stars shining
bright above you ¶

27:41.927 --> 27:47.264
¶ night breezes seem
to whisper I love you ¶

27:47.266 --> 27:52.803
¶ birds singing
in the sycamore tree ¶

27:52.805 --> 27:57.074
¶ dream a little dream
of me. ¶

28:07.285 --> 28:09.153
Ha!

28:09.155 --> 28:10.621
Not bad.

28:10.623 --> 28:12.956
That'll go over
real nice tomorrow.

28:12.958 --> 28:14.792
What, has the curfew
been lifted already?

28:14.794 --> 28:15.993
Aw, hell no.

28:15.995 --> 28:18.829
But we're not gonna
let that stop us.

28:18.831 --> 28:21.465
3:00 matinee every day

28:21.467 --> 28:24.134
Until the curfew's lifted.
"matinee"?

28:24.136 --> 28:26.336
That's right. Folks
can come see the show,

28:26.338 --> 28:28.138
Be home in time
for uncle miltie.
<i>Nein.</i>

28:28.140 --> 28:30.474
<i>Nein.</i> No matinees.

28:30.476 --> 28:32.810
No. No.

28:32.812 --> 28:35.145
People don't come to see
freaks in the heat of day.

28:35.147 --> 28:37.047
They come in the evening.

28:37.049 --> 28:40.317
When the darkness moves in
and speaks of mystery.

28:40.319 --> 28:43.020
The unknown.

28:43.022 --> 28:46.890
When logic loosens its vice grip

28:46.892 --> 28:49.893
And the imagination

28:49.895 --> 28:52.229
Comes out to play.

28:52.231 --> 28:54.732
The night allows the stars

28:54.734 --> 28:58.335
To shine and
we come alive.

28:58.337 --> 28:59.903
(laughs)
no.

28:59.905 --> 29:03.173
Daytime is for kiddie shows.

29:03.175 --> 29:07.077
Clowns and kewpie dolls.

29:07.079 --> 29:10.681
Maybe that's
what you're used to.

29:10.683 --> 29:13.250
But you're
in a real freak show now.

29:13.252 --> 29:16.186
My freak show!

29:16.188 --> 29:18.922
Dell? Listen to the lady.

29:18.924 --> 29:22.159
She's your boss now.

29:24.028 --> 29:26.630
No lady is the boss of me.

29:29.400 --> 29:31.769
Why don't we go outside
and calm down, huh?

29:31.771 --> 29:33.971
(gasps)

29:35.740 --> 29:37.541
The hell with this.

29:37.543 --> 29:40.377
I'm gonna go into town.

29:40.379 --> 29:42.446
Post some bills.

29:44.115 --> 29:45.949
There will be paying asses

29:45.951 --> 29:47.351
In these seats tomorrow!

29:48.386 --> 29:50.988
Curtain goes up at 3:00.

29:55.894 --> 29:56.927
(quiet laugh)

29:56.929 --> 30:00.397
That man is going
to be a problem.

30:00.399 --> 30:02.399
I will be the king,
you be anna.

30:02.401 --> 30:05.302
We can do my favorite scene
from <i>the king and I.</i>

30:05.304 --> 30:07.104
I saw the show on opening night.

30:07.106 --> 30:09.306
And then every night for a week.

30:09.308 --> 30:12.810
Yul brynner was transcendent.

30:12.812 --> 30:16.413
"et cetera,
et cetera, et cetera!"

30:16.415 --> 30:18.482
(laughs)

30:19.417 --> 30:21.251
You're right, of course.

30:21.253 --> 30:23.987
Puppetry is a sad cousin
to a live performance.

30:31.629 --> 30:34.898
I like real puppets
like you.

30:36.134 --> 30:39.002
I've had quite
the terrible day.

30:39.004 --> 30:41.672
I could use
a little diversion.

30:43.474 --> 30:45.776
Amuse me, clown.

30:45.778 --> 30:48.679
I'm sure mother has
paid you handsomely.

31:11.302 --> 31:14.872
Your silence is
utterly provocative.

31:17.842 --> 31:22.512
But you'll have
to earn your keep, clown.

31:22.514 --> 31:25.849
Come!

31:25.851 --> 31:28.652
Find a toy,

31:28.654 --> 31:32.122
And show me what kind
of clown you truly are.

31:58.016 --> 32:01.318
(muffled screaming)

32:23.041 --> 32:25.943
Excuse me, miss?

32:25.945 --> 32:27.978
You're back.

32:31.115 --> 32:33.550
Yes, ma'am.

32:33.552 --> 32:35.953
And I brought
some friends this time.

32:39.090 --> 32:40.791
W-what do you want?

32:42.560 --> 32:44.127
Well, this is a diner, ain't it?

32:44.129 --> 32:46.964
We're hungry.

32:46.966 --> 32:50.033
And we want to be served.

33:08.419 --> 33:12.089
Remember, everyone,
manners matter.

33:12.091 --> 33:12.956
Use your forks.

33:12.958 --> 33:15.058
Napkins on the lap.

33:25.770 --> 33:27.337
Woman:
Excuse me.

33:27.339 --> 33:28.972
Excuse me.

33:28.974 --> 33:30.941
Is there any place
else you can eat?

33:30.943 --> 33:33.243
You're upsetting my daughter.

33:35.980 --> 33:38.181
Well, I'm sure she'd love
the show if she saw it.

33:38.183 --> 33:41.985
Tell the ticket lady
jimmy sent you.

33:41.987 --> 33:44.187
We're ready to order now.

33:47.458 --> 33:49.960
What do you want?

33:49.962 --> 33:53.196
Salisbury steak
should hit the spot.

33:54.966 --> 33:55.999
I'll have
the iceberg wedge.

33:56.001 --> 33:57.100
I'm watching
my figure.

34:02.140 --> 34:03.473
Yeah, that looks pretty good.

34:03.475 --> 34:05.208
I think I'll just have that.

34:05.210 --> 34:07.044
Paul.

34:10.181 --> 34:12.816
Jimmy:
Uh, what are you having, pepper?

34:12.818 --> 34:13.984
Meat loaf.

34:13.986 --> 34:15.652
Meat loaf!
Yeah!

34:15.654 --> 34:16.653
Meat loaf!

34:16.655 --> 34:17.888
She'll have the meat loaf.

34:17.890 --> 34:19.723
Pepper:
Meat loaf! Okay!

34:25.163 --> 34:26.863
Um, excuse me.

34:26.865 --> 34:29.132
That's not yours.

34:33.037 --> 34:35.038
Let me guess.

34:35.040 --> 34:37.507
This was your bright idea.

34:37.509 --> 34:40.911
You eat at the camp.

34:40.913 --> 34:42.045
We're not bothering anybody.

34:42.047 --> 34:44.347
But that's not his food.

34:44.349 --> 34:47.084
I'm gonna have
to bus this plate.

34:47.086 --> 34:48.685
Don't you touch this girl!

34:48.687 --> 34:49.986
She's just
doing her job!

34:51.189 --> 34:53.090
Apologize to the girl.

34:53.092 --> 34:54.691
Hey! What's the
problem here?

34:54.693 --> 34:56.093
She was gonna
throw it out anyway.

35:03.534 --> 35:05.869
Like this?

35:05.871 --> 35:08.705
Manager: I have the right
to refuse service.

35:08.707 --> 35:10.540
You people
have to leave!

35:10.542 --> 35:12.109
Meat loaf! Meat loaf!

35:13.044 --> 35:14.277
Meat loaf!

35:14.279 --> 35:16.046
See what you did?!

35:16.048 --> 35:17.747
You give these folks
a free show,

35:17.749 --> 35:19.116
Who's gonna want to buy tickets?

35:19.118 --> 35:20.584
Pepper:
Meat loaf.

35:20.586 --> 35:22.752
Come on, you stupid freaks.
Let's go.

35:22.754 --> 35:23.920
Hey, stop calling
us freaks!

35:23.922 --> 35:25.055
We're people!

35:25.057 --> 35:27.290
Just like everybody
in this joint.

35:34.065 --> 35:35.866
I said, let's go.

35:52.483 --> 35:54.151
(grunting)

36:08.833 --> 36:10.100
Hey, come here.

36:10.102 --> 36:11.868
Come help me.

36:13.638 --> 36:16.239
Try this.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.182
We're never getting out.

36:33.157 --> 36:35.292
Now we have a chance.

36:35.294 --> 36:36.359
(chains rattle)

36:37.962 --> 36:40.730
Just be ready to run.

37:08.159 --> 37:10.227
¶

37:37.922 --> 37:39.990
¶

38:06.550 --> 38:09.619
(muffled humming)

38:22.933 --> 38:26.136
(rapid, muffled grunting)

38:27.638 --> 38:30.373
(slow, raspy breathing)

39:04.942 --> 39:06.076
(screams)

39:14.785 --> 39:17.387
(muffled screaming)

39:25.329 --> 39:26.496
Girl.

39:26.498 --> 39:27.964
Are you hurt?

39:27.966 --> 39:29.466
My god, mister, please--
you have to help us.

39:29.468 --> 39:31.468
Please, the clown,
he's crazy!

39:31.470 --> 39:32.702
Here, here.

39:32.704 --> 39:33.970
Oh, wait.

39:33.972 --> 39:35.305
We'll get to the
bottom of this.

39:35.307 --> 39:36.706
(screaming)

39:36.708 --> 39:38.141
No, what are you doing?!

39:38.143 --> 39:40.043
We can't go back...
He's a killer!

39:40.045 --> 39:41.311
Don't!

39:41.313 --> 39:43.580
(bonnie screaming)

39:45.316 --> 39:48.051
Clown, look what I have for you.

39:50.721 --> 39:53.723
You'll have to do a much
better job of confinement

39:53.725 --> 39:55.492
If we're going to have any fun.

39:55.494 --> 39:57.026
Bonnie:
No...!
(grunts)

39:57.028 --> 39:59.396
No! No!

39:59.398 --> 40:01.398
Please!

40:01.400 --> 40:03.600
No! Stop it! No...!

40:11.709 --> 40:13.777
¶

40:39.703 --> 40:41.604
Elsa...?

40:43.874 --> 40:45.708
Have you no decorum?

40:45.710 --> 40:49.045
Barging into
a lady's tent unannounced?

40:49.047 --> 40:50.914
You're bleeding.

40:50.916 --> 40:53.082
He can't stay
here, elsa.

40:53.084 --> 40:55.718
I take it you refer
to our new strongman.

40:55.720 --> 40:57.887
You know he's out putting
matinee posters all over town,

40:57.889 --> 40:59.055
After you asked
him not to?

40:59.057 --> 41:00.423
Perhaps it's
for the best.

41:00.425 --> 41:03.893
We don't know how long
this curfew will last.

41:03.895 --> 41:05.728
I've decided to give
his scheme a try.

41:05.730 --> 41:06.963
Why not?

41:06.965 --> 41:09.065
Elsa, he'll tear
this troop apart!

41:09.067 --> 41:12.101
Or hold it together.

41:12.103 --> 41:15.738
If the killer who stalks
this town is not soon caught,

41:15.740 --> 41:19.075
The people will seek out
scapegoats.

41:19.077 --> 41:21.077
And your kind...

41:21.079 --> 41:23.947
Have always proven
convenient sacrifices

41:23.949 --> 41:25.615
In such instances.

41:25.617 --> 41:28.251
You think that thick-necked
goon is gonna protect us?

41:28.253 --> 41:32.822
I think for now, it's good to
have a man of strength among us.

41:32.824 --> 41:34.324
You've already got one.

41:34.326 --> 41:36.326
What's that?

41:36.328 --> 41:38.094
That's the only thing
left of the cop

41:38.096 --> 41:39.262
Who came here
the other day.

41:39.264 --> 41:42.332
He was gonna take
the twins, elsa.

41:42.334 --> 41:44.834
He threatened to run us
out of town or worse.

41:47.805 --> 41:49.105
My   <i>liebchen.</i>

41:49.107 --> 41:51.941
How have I
underestimated you?

41:51.943 --> 41:54.010
Not just me.

41:54.012 --> 41:55.812
Dell.

41:55.814 --> 41:58.414
See where he's
got you billed?

42:01.118 --> 42:04.087
He's got to go.

42:06.490 --> 42:08.625
Straight out of the jungle,

42:08.627 --> 42:10.360
And fresh off the farm,

42:11.462 --> 42:13.129
Meep the geek!

42:13.131 --> 42:16.032
Meep!

42:19.136 --> 42:21.137
You like what you see, so far?

42:21.139 --> 42:23.973
Well, hold onto your seats,
ladies and gents,

42:23.975 --> 42:26.009
Because today,
for the first time ever,

42:26.011 --> 42:30.380
You will have the privilege
of watching a song and dance act

42:30.382 --> 42:33.483
By our brand new headliners!

42:33.485 --> 42:36.486
Ladies and gentlemen,

42:36.488 --> 42:39.022
From the exotic land of siam,

42:39.024 --> 42:42.559
The spectacular siamese sisters!

42:45.663 --> 42:49.098
(intro playing)

42:55.039 --> 42:59.108
¶ I've been a bad, bad girl

43:00.878 --> 43:05.582
¶ I've been careless
with a delicate man ¶

43:06.850 --> 43:09.586
¶ and it's a sad, sad world

43:10.888 --> 43:13.256
¶ when a girl will break a boy

43:13.258 --> 43:15.558
¶ just because she can

43:15.560 --> 43:17.927
¶ whoa, help me,
but don't tell me ¶

43:17.929 --> 43:20.263
¶ to deny it
¶ deny it

43:20.265 --> 43:23.933
¶ I've got to cleanse myself
of all these lies ¶

43:23.935 --> 43:27.070
¶ till I'm good enough for him

43:27.072 --> 43:29.105
¶ I've got a lot to lose

43:29.107 --> 43:31.708
¶ and I'm betting high,
so I'm begging you ¶

43:31.710 --> 43:33.076
¶ before it ends

43:33.078 --> 43:36.546
¶ just tell me
where to begin ¶

43:36.548 --> 43:37.714
¶ ooh-ooh

43:37.716 --> 43:39.449
Both:
¶ what I need

43:39.451 --> 43:41.217
Where the hell do
you think you're going?

43:41.219 --> 43:42.919
What, I got to ask permission
to take a leak now, too?

43:42.921 --> 43:47.056
¶ 'cause I'm feeling
like a criminal ¶

43:47.058 --> 43:50.059
¶ and I need to be redeemed

43:50.061 --> 43:52.795
¶ to the one
I've sinned against ¶

43:52.797 --> 43:57.000
¶ because he's all
I ever knew of love ¶

43:58.102 --> 43:59.068
¶ yeah...

43:59.070 --> 44:01.104
¶ what I need

44:01.106 --> 44:03.473
¶ is a good defense

44:03.475 --> 44:08.444
¶ 'cause I'm feeling
like a criminal ¶

44:08.446 --> 44:14.117
¶ and I need to be redeemed
to the one I've sinned against ¶

44:14.119 --> 44:17.954
¶ because he's all
I ever knew of ¶

44:17.956 --> 44:24.861
¶ love.

44:34.672 --> 44:38.241
(audience cheers and applauds)

44:49.453 --> 44:52.855
(sirens wailing)

45:05.803 --> 45:08.104
¶

45:17.147 --> 45:19.048
Man:
Elsa mars.

45:19.050 --> 45:20.983
We have a warrant
to search the premises

45:20.985 --> 45:22.318
For evidence pertaining
to the disappearance

45:22.320 --> 45:24.020
Of detective
robert bunch.

45:24.022 --> 45:26.856
On what grounds, officer?

45:26.858 --> 45:31.060
We received an anonymous tip.

45:31.062 --> 45:32.895
We have reasons to believe
he was murdered here.

45:34.198 --> 45:36.899
Which one of these tents
belongs to dell toledo?

45:36.901 --> 45:38.000
What?

45:38.002 --> 45:39.502
That one over there.

45:39.504 --> 45:40.903
Turn it upside down!
Dell: Wait a minute.

45:40.905 --> 45:42.071
What the hell
is going on here?

45:42.073 --> 45:43.906
Hey, hold on, pal.

45:43.908 --> 45:46.175
We only just got here
a couple of days ago.

45:46.177 --> 45:47.176
We haven't
done anything.

45:47.178 --> 45:48.177
Shut your trap.

45:48.179 --> 45:49.345
Desiree:
Dell! Dell!

45:49.347 --> 45:50.880
Colquitt: We already
got an earful

45:50.882 --> 45:53.850
About what a boy scout
you were, from chicago pd.

45:53.852 --> 45:55.918
I'm telling you--
there's nothing in there.

46:01.525 --> 46:03.526
Why are you so smug?

46:03.528 --> 46:06.095
You're the one with
the guilty look on your face.

46:06.097 --> 46:07.897
Nothing in the trailer, sir.

46:07.899 --> 46:10.933
Colquitt: Nobody moves a muscle
until we search every tent here!

46:10.935 --> 46:12.268
Tear this place apart!

46:19.376 --> 46:21.444
Is this what
guilt looks like?

46:22.880 --> 46:26.048
Tragic, isn't it,
when a plan breaks down?

46:26.050 --> 46:27.383
Dell: <i>Where do you think</i>
<i>you're going?</i>

46:27.385 --> 46:29.118
Dot:
¶ what I need

46:29.120 --> 46:32.021
¶ is a good defense

46:33.557 --> 46:35.558
Dell:
Jimmy...

46:35.560 --> 46:38.728
There was no way the cops
were ever gonna find

46:38.730 --> 46:40.997
What you left behind
in my trailer.

46:41.899 --> 46:43.466
Officer:
Found it, sir!

46:43.468 --> 46:45.468
(whimpering):
Meep-meep... Meep...

46:47.471 --> 46:49.906
Meep...
(whimpering)

46:49.908 --> 46:51.307
It was under his bed roll.

46:56.480 --> 46:58.314
This is detective bunch's badge.

46:58.316 --> 47:01.918
I'm shocked, officer.

47:01.920 --> 47:03.319
Shocked.

47:06.423 --> 47:09.425
Take this freak to the station.

47:09.427 --> 47:11.494
(meep whimpering)

47:12.596 --> 47:14.664
(engine starts)

47:39.122 --> 47:40.857
(whimpering)

47:46.997 --> 47:49.999
(door creaking shut)

47:50.001 --> 47:52.368
Doyle: I'm telling you,
there's no way this guy

47:52.370 --> 47:53.636
Is the mastermind
behind everything.

47:53.638 --> 47:55.137
He had the badge.

47:55.139 --> 47:56.305
Even if he didn't
kill those people,

47:56.307 --> 47:57.974
He knows who did.
A night in the tank,

47:57.976 --> 48:01.043
You'll name names.

48:01.045 --> 48:03.379
Get a load of this.

48:05.983 --> 48:08.050
(whimpering)

48:11.822 --> 48:13.890
Inmate:
So you're the big, scary killer?

48:17.027 --> 48:19.328
You like to diddle
little kiddies, you sick freak?

48:19.330 --> 48:21.397
(whimpering)

48:24.501 --> 48:26.168
Greaser: I heard they
found the toy store owner

48:26.170 --> 48:28.070
With his fingers missing.

48:28.072 --> 48:30.006
How about I rip yours off,
one by one?

48:30.008 --> 48:31.908
(shrieking):
Meep!

48:31.910 --> 48:33.542
Meep!

48:33.544 --> 48:35.011
Meep!

48:35.013 --> 48:37.079
(echoing):
Meep.

48:52.896 --> 48:54.297
(whispering):
Wake up.

48:57.768 --> 48:59.268
I came to congratulate you

48:59.270 --> 49:01.737
On your triumph tonight.

49:01.739 --> 49:04.206
They loved her, not me.

49:04.208 --> 49:07.576
I kept trying to run
off the stage.

49:07.578 --> 49:10.212
I felt so embarrassed.

49:10.214 --> 49:13.082
And now she's really mad at me.

49:13.084 --> 49:14.717
She's mad at you?
Mm-hmm.

49:14.719 --> 49:15.918
Oh. (chuckles)

49:15.920 --> 49:19.121
She deliberately eclipsed you.

49:19.123 --> 49:21.590
She made you feel like shite.

49:21.592 --> 49:23.960
I thought I would be good.

49:27.064 --> 49:29.432
I thought all I needed
was an audience.

49:29.434 --> 49:33.135
And it would all come together.

49:34.805 --> 49:36.906
I'm such

49:36.908 --> 49:38.574
A stupid fool.

49:38.576 --> 49:40.776
That's how she
wants you to feel.

49:40.778 --> 49:43.079
These people get
their confidence

49:43.081 --> 49:47.650
From feeding off others'
self-doubt.

49:50.921 --> 49:53.789
You talking in your sleep?

49:53.791 --> 49:56.325
No, it's elsa.

49:56.327 --> 49:59.328
She came to congratulate us.

49:59.330 --> 50:00.663
Well, tell her thanks.

50:00.665 --> 50:02.531
We're sleeping.

50:07.437 --> 50:09.438
It's like she's become
another person.

50:09.440 --> 50:10.606
Oh.

50:10.608 --> 50:13.976
Really, truly, anyone can see...

50:13.978 --> 50:17.313
You are the star,

50:17.315 --> 50:19.015
My angel.

50:19.017 --> 50:21.050
(giggling softly)

50:26.123 --> 50:27.857
But that one,

50:27.859 --> 50:29.992
She has a dark soul.

50:29.994 --> 50:31.027
Mm-hmm.

50:33.463 --> 50:35.031
She wants what you have,

50:35.033 --> 50:37.700
And she knows how to take it.

50:41.371 --> 50:44.106
But you mustn't allow it.

50:52.516 --> 50:54.583
You mustn't allow it.

50:56.887 --> 50:58.921
My angel.

51:35.192 --> 51:37.259
(sighs)

51:43.533 --> 51:45.167
(coughs)

51:48.605 --> 51:51.340
Son, what are you doing?

51:54.377 --> 51:56.445
What's it look like I'm doing?

51:58.949 --> 52:00.916
My sweet boy.

52:00.918 --> 52:02.885
What's wrong?

52:02.887 --> 52:04.887
I've never seen you
take a drink before.

52:04.889 --> 52:06.388
I've always been
so proud of you,

52:06.390 --> 52:08.424
Staying away from this shit.

52:08.426 --> 52:11.260
You're such an example
to the others.

52:11.262 --> 52:13.329
I can't help the others.

52:18.401 --> 52:20.469
(sniffles)
they took meep.

52:23.140 --> 52:25.207
Meep.

52:28.145 --> 52:30.212
He didn't do anything.

52:32.249 --> 52:33.782
It's my fault.

52:33.784 --> 52:34.984
That's nonsense.

52:34.986 --> 52:36.986
You had nothing to do with that.

52:36.988 --> 52:40.055
The police had no right,
roughing you up like that.

52:42.959 --> 52:44.927
I just wanted him gone.

52:44.929 --> 52:48.130
Meep?

52:48.132 --> 52:49.431
Dell.

52:49.433 --> 52:52.434
He's bad news.

52:52.436 --> 52:54.603
More'n that, jimmy,

52:54.605 --> 52:56.438
I want you to stay away
from that man.

52:56.440 --> 52:58.307
You hear me?

52:58.309 --> 52:59.308
(thumps stage)

52:59.310 --> 53:00.609
(groans)

53:00.611 --> 53:03.112
I gotta tell them.

53:03.114 --> 53:04.980
I gotta get him out.

53:04.982 --> 53:06.949
No, no, jimmy...
Yeah, I've gotta tell them...

53:06.951 --> 53:09.785
That's easier said than done.
...He can get out!

53:09.787 --> 53:10.986
The bastard has
signed a contract.

53:10.988 --> 53:12.188
Jimmy!

53:13.990 --> 53:15.291
Not dell!

53:15.293 --> 53:17.259
Meep!

53:19.696 --> 53:22.798
He's not gonna be able to spend
the night in jail, mom.

53:22.800 --> 53:24.800
He's not tough.

53:24.802 --> 53:26.969
(panting)

53:26.971 --> 53:30.639
He's just weird.

53:30.641 --> 53:33.509
I gotta...

53:33.511 --> 53:36.212
I have to tell them everything.

53:38.982 --> 53:40.382
(sighs)

53:40.384 --> 53:42.084
I'm sorry.

53:44.821 --> 53:46.755
Tell who what?

53:48.558 --> 53:49.825
Jimmy?

53:49.827 --> 53:52.194
Jimmy!

53:52.196 --> 53:54.463
(truck approaching)

54:17.687 --> 54:19.989
