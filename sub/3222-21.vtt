00:03.503 --> 00:04.670
I am inside you.

00:04.838 --> 00:07.172
Is it me or is this just like the cage?

00:13.054 --> 00:14.179
- Meg.
- So, Dean...

00:14.347 --> 00:17.016
...what's poor dead Castiel
doing in that junker there?

00:17.183 --> 00:19.184
- He doesn't know he's Cass.
- I know.

00:19.352 --> 00:22.771
- So here's the deal. I need friends.
- We go straight to Sam.

00:22.939 --> 00:26.275
- So there's nothing?
- This isn't a problem I can make disappear.

00:26.443 --> 00:28.235
But I may be able to shift it.

00:29.529 --> 00:32.698
- I don't know. We can't leave him.
- We can't bring him with us.

00:32.866 --> 00:35.451
Everything on the planet's out for us.
This is safer.

00:35.618 --> 00:38.203
Welcome to the team, Nurse Masters.

00:38.371 --> 00:40.956
So Dick's funding an archaeological dig?

00:41.124 --> 00:45.252
Outstanding. And you'll call
as soon as the package is in hand?

00:46.046 --> 00:49.465
Whatever it is he wants it,
which means we gotta grab it. End of story.

00:49.632 --> 00:52.718
I've been looking for this for a very,
very long time.

00:55.346 --> 00:56.555
So now what?

00:56.723 --> 01:00.184
Good question. Why don't we answer
that a thousand miles away from here.

01:59.035 --> 02:02.079
- Hey, Kevin.
- Princeton adjusted its acceptance rate...

02:02.247 --> 02:03.831
...down to 8.7 percent for 2013.

02:03.998 --> 02:05.332
Breathe, Kevin.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.334
- Are you studying?
- I'm talking to you.

02:07.502 --> 02:10.711
I'll start on probability and statistics
in 14 minutes.

02:10.880 --> 02:11.964
I hate probability.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.133
Tomorrow's my last chance
to get perfect.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.467
Your SATs are great.

02:15.635 --> 02:19.346
Channing, everybody's SATs are great.
I have to do perfect.

02:19.514 --> 02:22.224
Who knows, the essays
are at least as important.

02:27.856 --> 02:31.316
- I have absolutely nothing to say.
- I know. I know what you mean.

02:31.484 --> 02:33.485
I read one by a kid who got into Cornell.

02:33.653 --> 02:35.904
He didn't have any arms
or legs or anything.

02:36.072 --> 02:39.074
He had to type the whole thing
with his mouth.

02:39.242 --> 02:40.492
It was beautiful.

02:42.078 --> 02:43.370
I am so screwed.

02:44.747 --> 02:47.833
You know, no matter what...

02:48.001 --> 02:50.502
...one day college isn't going
to matter anymore.

02:51.087 --> 02:52.254
You're out of your mind.

03:00.221 --> 03:02.181
That's a lot of fuss over a caveman Lego.

03:02.348 --> 03:03.682
Yeah.

03:03.850 --> 03:06.894
Well, whatever Dick wants
is bricked up inside that.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.696
All right.

03:42.222 --> 03:45.891
That sound like somebody saying,
"No, wait, stop" to you?

03:46.768 --> 03:50.896
- Uh, yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

03:52.732 --> 03:54.233
Oh, well.

05:04.887 --> 05:06.513
I don't know.

05:06.681 --> 05:09.474
I think the line might panic
when they turn this corner...

05:09.642 --> 05:11.059
...see the blade-assembly up ahead.

05:15.982 --> 05:19.818
Strange, isn't it? That someone
would choose to be named Dick?

05:22.822 --> 05:24.823
Yes?

05:29.162 --> 05:31.163
KEVIN
This is Kevin Tran's voicemail.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.123
Please leave a message.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.168
Kevin? It's Mom.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.712
I know you're at school already,
about to take the test.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.340
All your work
will net the results we've discussed.

05:41.507 --> 05:43.675
- Ten-twenty-two? What?
- Like Dr. Enger said...

05:43.843 --> 05:46.595
...please don't obsess
on the quote-unquote "perfect."

05:46.763 --> 05:50.849
That's just a nice feather in our cap,
if we get it.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.352
Now, we're about
to finish up our last seminar.

05:53.519 --> 05:58.523
My flight's confirmed for 7.
So I'll see you at breakfast tomorrow.

05:58.691 --> 06:00.525
Love you, honey.

06:04.197 --> 06:07.199
At a loss to explain
the continent-wide storm system...

06:07.367 --> 06:09.201
...that appeared seemingly
out of nowhere...

06:09.369 --> 06:12.954
...blanketing a good part of the nation
in freak lightning displays.

06:13.164 --> 06:16.124
Here with Dr. Marlon Price
of the U.S. Meteorological Survey...

06:16.292 --> 06:18.210
...at a press conference earlier today.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.712
"Baffled?" No, I'm not baffled.

06:20.880 --> 06:24.383
Frankly, I'm offended.
This is not the way weather behaves.

06:24.550 --> 06:28.553
Power outages and related damages
to sensitive electronic equipment...

06:28.721 --> 06:31.598
...have been reported
from as far east as Cape Cod...

06:31.766 --> 06:33.934
...all the way to Seattle.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.269
Bobby?

06:39.232 --> 06:40.941
Bobby, that you?

06:41.692 --> 06:42.734
Think so.

06:44.112 --> 06:47.572
But the whole adventure at Roman's
seems to have drained his batteries.

06:52.829 --> 06:56.289
So what?
We start the storm heard round the world?

06:56.457 --> 06:58.250
We broke this open last night...

06:58.418 --> 07:01.253
...every maternity ward
within a hundred-mile radius got slammed.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.631
Looks like any woman in the last month
of her pregnancy went into labor.

07:04.799 --> 07:06.174
Hmm.

07:06.926 --> 07:08.802
This one goes out to all the ladies.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.264
So heavyweight signs, omens,
what do we got?

07:12.432 --> 07:15.767
I assume it's writing.
But I've never seen anything like it. Ever.

07:15.935 --> 07:18.770
And it doesn't match anything
in any book or online.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.482
So Big Daddy Chopper lands here,
he grabs himself some Dick.

07:22.650 --> 07:25.861
And then he starts secretly underwriting
university departments...

07:26.028 --> 07:29.156
...pouring money into digs. All for this.

07:29.323 --> 07:30.740
Why?

07:31.451 --> 07:33.243
No clue.

07:33.619 --> 07:37.205
We do know that he will be tearing
new ones until he gets it back though.

07:37.373 --> 07:41.960
Look, we gotta take a minute, hole up
somewhere safe, find out what we got.

07:42.128 --> 07:44.171
- Rufus' cabin, then?
- Yeah.

07:44.338 --> 07:46.965
This time, I'm doing the shopping.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.512
It's Meg.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.349
- What?
- What up, Bullwinkle?

07:56.517 --> 07:59.060
Just a little FYI call, your boy's awake.

07:59.270 --> 08:02.481
- What? Cass is awake.
- What? When? When?

08:02.648 --> 08:03.732
Last night, about 8.

08:03.900 --> 08:07.486
- And you waited till now to call us?
- I've been busy with Cass.

08:07.653 --> 08:10.572
He's just a tad different
than when he dozed off, okay?

08:10.781 --> 08:13.825
- What do you mean, "different?"
- Hey, Seacrest, guess what?

08:13.993 --> 08:16.661
Not a nurse. Just playing one on TV.

08:17.705 --> 08:20.165
Want answers, start driving.

08:22.793 --> 08:27.380
- Great. So Indiana?
- Yeah.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.008
Eight o'clock last night.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.760
Yeah.

08:31.928 --> 08:34.304
Same time we opened up that thing.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.390
Aah! Aah!

08:43.022 --> 08:44.397
- Who?
- Kevin?

08:44.565 --> 08:46.691
Where were you today?
You missed the test.

08:46.859 --> 08:49.569
- I...
- And student council and quartet.

08:49.737 --> 08:53.740
I had to take my mom's car.
I think I had a seizure or something.

08:55.576 --> 08:57.577
I've been chosen.

08:57.745 --> 08:59.037
It's my birthright.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.915
Oh, my God, Kevin,
all the pressure you've been under...

09:02.083 --> 09:05.460
...this isn't one of those
over-achiever teen meltdowns, is it?

09:06.045 --> 09:09.714
I'm supposed to keep going.
I'm not allowed to stop.

09:09.882 --> 09:11.883
What do you mean, "Not allowed"?

09:13.219 --> 09:14.553
Is someone with you?

09:14.720 --> 09:19.057
They didn't make you
take your mother's car, did they? Kevin?

09:37.034 --> 09:38.868
We raced all the way. I don't know.

09:39.036 --> 09:41.538
Can't say I'm fired up
to see what's left of the guy.

09:41.706 --> 09:43.123
You think he remembers it all?

09:43.291 --> 09:47.210
That... I'm guessing, whatever kind of
hell-baggage he lifted off at your plate.

09:47.378 --> 09:49.129
- It's not gonna be pretty.
- Hey.

09:49.297 --> 09:52.549
Excuse me, gentlemen,
but it's way past visiting hours.

09:52.717 --> 09:55.552
It's okay, Abel. I've been expecting them.

09:56.887 --> 09:59.306
Hello, boys.

10:10.109 --> 10:12.068
Hey, Cass.

10:21.162 --> 10:22.621
Hello, Dean.

10:25.833 --> 10:28.918
- Sam.
- Hey, Castiel.

10:29.086 --> 10:31.796
Well, look at you,
walking and talking. That's...

10:32.590 --> 10:34.174
That's great, right?

10:38.971 --> 10:40.430
Pull my finger.

10:42.933 --> 10:44.100
What?

10:44.268 --> 10:47.771
My finger. Pull it.

11:08.292 --> 11:11.711
Okay, just hang on, Cass.
Let us catch up to you for a second.

11:11.879 --> 11:14.964
So you're saying
you remember who you are.

11:15.132 --> 11:19.344
- What you are.
- Yes. Of course. Oh.

11:19.637 --> 11:23.223
Outside today, in the garden,
I followed a honeybee.

11:23.391 --> 11:25.725
I saw the Route of Flowers.

11:25.893 --> 11:29.562
It's all right there. The whole plan.
There's nothing to add.

11:29.730 --> 11:33.566
- You might wanna add a little Thorazine.
- Right? He's been like the naked guy...

11:33.734 --> 11:36.528
...at the rave ever since he woke up.
Totally useless.

11:36.696 --> 11:37.904
Will you look at her?

11:38.114 --> 11:39.239
My caretaker.

11:39.824 --> 11:44.411
All of that thorny pain so beautiful.

11:44.620 --> 11:48.164
We've been over this.
I don't like poetry. Put up or shut up.

11:48.332 --> 11:51.668
Okay. Ahem. So, Cass,
you said you woke up last night?

11:51.836 --> 11:56.256
Yes. I heard a, "ping"
that pierced me and, well...

11:57.133 --> 12:00.677
You wouldn't have heard it
unless you were an angel at the time.

12:01.512 --> 12:03.930
It's also when we opened this.

12:05.599 --> 12:08.435
Oh. Of course. Now I understand.

12:09.353 --> 12:12.188
- Understand what?
- You were the ones.

12:12.356 --> 12:15.358
Well, heh, I guess that makes sense.

12:16.068 --> 12:17.235
What makes sense?

12:17.403 --> 12:22.198
If someone was going to free the Word
from the vault of the Earth...

12:22.366 --> 12:24.617
...it would end up being you two.

12:24.785 --> 12:27.120
Oh, I love you guys. Unh!

12:27.288 --> 12:29.873
Look. Okay. All right. Okay.

12:30.040 --> 12:34.043
Ahem. Yeah. Yeah. You said something
about "the Word." Is that what's written?

12:34.211 --> 12:38.214
Did you know that a cat's penis
is sharply barbed along its shaft?

12:38.382 --> 12:41.384
I know for a fact
the females were not consulted about that.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.306
Cass, please.

12:46.474 --> 12:49.100
We're losing ground out there, okay?
We need your help.

12:49.268 --> 12:52.896
- Can you not see that?
- Hey, this is the handwriting of Metatron.

12:54.482 --> 12:58.067
Metatron? Heh.
You saying a Transformer wrote that?

12:58.235 --> 12:59.486
No. That's Megatron.

12:59.695 --> 13:01.905
- What?
- The Transformer, it's Megatron.

13:02.907 --> 13:04.407
- What?
- Metatron.

13:05.576 --> 13:07.911
He's an angel. He's the scribe of God.

13:08.078 --> 13:11.122
He took down dictation
when Creation was being formed.

13:11.290 --> 13:14.334
- That's the Word of God?
- One of them, yes.

13:15.252 --> 13:17.420
Uh, well, what's it say, then?

13:19.632 --> 13:22.091
Uh... "Tree."

13:26.597 --> 13:30.266
Horse? Fiddler Crab? I can't read it.
It wasn't meant for angels.

13:30.434 --> 13:31.851
Okay, this all sounds bad.

13:32.019 --> 13:34.979
What are you two jackasses
doing with the Word of God?

13:35.856 --> 13:38.942
- Let me see that thing.
- Back off, Meg.

13:39.109 --> 13:41.820
- Come on. It's my ass too.
- Back off.

13:41.987 --> 13:45.448
Damn it, enough of this
demons are second-class citizens crap!

13:45.616 --> 13:46.658
Don't like conflict.

13:49.703 --> 13:50.829
Uh...

13:50.996 --> 13:54.207
- What the hell was that?
- You heard him. He doesn't like conflict.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.543
He's down in the day room now.
I guarantee it.

13:57.378 --> 13:58.878
All right, I'll go handle Cass.

13:59.046 --> 14:01.714
Sam, will you please pick up
the Word of God?

14:01.882 --> 14:03.675
Yeah.

14:05.803 --> 14:07.554
What are you guys caught up in now?

14:09.473 --> 14:11.474
I deserve to know, Sam.

14:15.980 --> 14:17.981
Okay, fine.

14:18.148 --> 14:22.694
I'll hit the road then.
Let me just go get my angel.

14:25.573 --> 14:28.533
Meg, what are you talking about? Stop.

14:29.702 --> 14:33.037
We both call, who do you think
Cass will come to? I'm guessing me.

14:34.498 --> 14:37.000
You heard him, thorny beauty, blah, blah.

14:37.167 --> 14:40.587
I'm the saint who stayed with him.
He owes me.

14:40.796 --> 14:43.047
- His words.
- Okay, what about what he owes us?

14:43.215 --> 14:47.218
Well, work on him a little, maybe he'll
start crushing on you too, hot-stuff.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.345
What you gonna do with a broken angel?

14:49.513 --> 14:53.016
I'll take power where I can get it.
I've got myself to look out for.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.027
What the hell?

15:25.132 --> 15:26.549
Hey!

15:29.929 --> 15:32.555
No, stop, leave me alone!

15:38.395 --> 15:41.064
Not a demon or a Chomper.
What the hell are you?

15:43.108 --> 15:48.154
I'm Kevin Tran.
I'm in Advanced Placement.

15:48.364 --> 15:51.115
- Please don't kill me.
- I'm not gonna kill you.

15:55.120 --> 16:00.875
I'm sorry.

16:01.669 --> 16:06.089
I don't know why,
but I can't let go of this.

16:18.519 --> 16:21.896
You realize you just broke God's Word.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.826
It's Sam's thing, isn't it?

16:37.162 --> 16:42.000
You taking on his, uh, cage-match scars.

16:42.543 --> 16:44.836
I'm guessing that's what
broke your bank, right?

16:45.504 --> 16:49.007
Well, it took everything to get me here.

16:49.800 --> 16:52.593
- What are you talking about, man?
- Dean.

16:53.595 --> 16:55.596
I know you want different answers.

16:55.806 --> 16:59.600
No, I want you to button up your coat
and help us take down Leviathans.

17:04.106 --> 17:06.773
Do you remember what you did?

17:30.299 --> 17:31.466
Do you want to go first?

17:33.385 --> 17:36.888
You really stepped in it, kid. Oh, man.

17:37.056 --> 17:40.641
All I know is, this is... It's for me.

17:42.144 --> 17:45.396
- I'm supposed to keep it.
- Good luck.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.483
But you don't know what it is?

17:53.113 --> 17:54.280
Open it.

18:19.681 --> 18:23.976
You know, we weren't sure, at first,
which monkeys were gonna make it.

18:24.144 --> 18:26.854
No offense, but I was backing
the Neanderthals...

18:27.022 --> 18:30.191
...because their poetry was just amazing.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.903
It's in perfect tune with the Spheres.

18:34.822 --> 18:39.325
But in the end, it was you.
The Homo sapiens sapiens.

18:39.493 --> 18:42.537
You guys ate the apple, invented pants.

18:42.704 --> 18:45.832
Cass, where can we find this, uh, Metatron?
Is he still alive?

18:45.999 --> 18:48.668
I'm sorry.
I think you have to go back to start.

18:53.841 --> 18:55.299
This is important.

19:04.143 --> 19:07.520
I think Metatron could stop a lot of bad.
You understand that?

19:07.688 --> 19:11.232
We live in a "Sorry" universe.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.693
It's engineered to create conflict.

19:13.861 --> 19:18.072
I mean, why should I prosper
from your misfortune?

19:20.576 --> 19:23.703
But these are the rules.
I didn't make them.

19:23.871 --> 19:25.705
You made some of them.

19:25.873 --> 19:29.584
When you tried to become God,
when you cut that hole into that wall.

19:29.751 --> 19:31.502
Dean...

19:34.089 --> 19:36.090
- It's your move.
- Screw the damn game!

19:43.098 --> 19:46.100
Forget the game, Cass.

19:47.769 --> 19:50.271
I'm sorry, Dean.

19:51.607 --> 19:53.191
No.

19:53.734 --> 19:57.028
You're playing "Sorry."

20:01.283 --> 20:03.451
- It's writing.
- Yeah. Yeah, we get that.

20:03.619 --> 20:06.078
What's Leviathan?

20:06.246 --> 20:08.789
What? You can read it?
Is that what it says?

20:08.999 --> 20:10.750
Sort of. It hurts a little.

20:10.918 --> 20:13.586
Like looking through
somebody else's glasses but I think it...

20:13.754 --> 20:15.421
It's about Leviathan.

20:15.589 --> 20:21.260
How it came to be.
God locked them up far away, right?

20:21.428 --> 20:24.222
Like, in jail, because they're so...

20:25.057 --> 20:26.307
They're...

20:29.228 --> 20:34.065
- They're real. Aren't they?
- Yeah, Kevin, they are. And they're here.

20:35.317 --> 20:37.485
Does it say anything
about how to kill them?

20:37.653 --> 20:40.279
Because that's...
That's kind of been a problem.

20:40.447 --> 20:42.657
I don't know.
It's not like reading-reading.

20:42.824 --> 20:46.827
- It's hard to focus on it too long.
- Sam. Something's up.

20:46.995 --> 20:48.663
What?

20:50.290 --> 20:53.501
- Aah!
- Kevin, hey, hey, hey! Kevin.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.047
Demon.

21:08.934 --> 21:11.477
- What?
- Sam.

21:12.187 --> 21:14.188
He's talking to angels.

21:14.356 --> 21:17.525
A demon whore and a Winchester again.

21:19.611 --> 21:22.613
Step away from the Prophet.

21:23.615 --> 21:27.326
- Who? Me?
- Sole keeper of the Word on Earth.

21:27.494 --> 21:28.703
We are here to take you.

21:28.870 --> 21:31.664
- What do you mean "take"?
- Kill the demon and her lover.

21:31.832 --> 21:34.041
That's not how it... We're not...

21:37.296 --> 21:38.462
Where did you get that?

21:44.636 --> 21:46.095
Castiel.

21:47.681 --> 21:48.973
Hi.

21:50.517 --> 21:51.559
You're alive.

21:55.272 --> 21:56.689
You.

21:57.899 --> 21:59.025
Hello, Hester.

21:59.192 --> 22:01.152
You smote thousands in Heaven.

22:01.862 --> 22:04.530
You gave a big, scary speech,
then you were gone.

22:05.699 --> 22:09.869
- What the hell was that?
- Rude, for one thing.

22:10.871 --> 22:12.747
Where have you been?

22:13.248 --> 22:15.249
Oh, Inias.

22:15.417 --> 22:19.128
Hester, I know you want something.

22:20.255 --> 22:22.631
Answers. And I...

22:23.425 --> 22:28.346
I wish it could be that... There are
still many things I can teach you.

22:28.513 --> 22:30.556
I can offer, um...

22:31.183 --> 22:33.267
Well, perspective.

22:33.435 --> 22:35.603
Here, pull my finger.

22:38.315 --> 22:40.608
Uh... Uh...

22:40.776 --> 22:43.611
Meg will get another light
and I'll blow it out again...

22:43.779 --> 22:48.032
Well, this time it'll be funny,
and we'll all look back and laugh.

22:51.787 --> 22:56.123
- You're insane.
- Hey! Heads up, sunshine.

23:05.592 --> 23:09.303
All angels blown back to their corners.
We got, like, three, four hours tops.

23:10.597 --> 23:13.099
- Meg, where did you get that?
- A lot of angels died...

23:13.266 --> 23:19.188
What's happening?

23:20.732 --> 23:22.149
What is that?

23:22.317 --> 23:25.903
It's, uh, Kevin Tran.

23:26.071 --> 23:28.948
He's, uh, in Advanced Placement.

23:37.749 --> 23:40.835
So these Leviathans,
these monsters, are real.

23:41.795 --> 23:46.590
- And angels? With wings?
- No. Uh, no wings.

23:46.758 --> 23:49.802
- No anything...
- No junk. Junk-less.

23:49.970 --> 23:54.056
So, Kevin, you can, uh, read the
chicken-scratch on the God-rock, huh?

23:55.392 --> 23:59.061
That is back in one piece, I see.
And you're saying that there's some sort...

23:59.271 --> 24:01.230
...of a "How To Punch Dick" recipe
in there?

24:01.398 --> 24:03.065
I don't know what you're saying...

24:03.275 --> 24:06.068
...but it seems kind of like
an in case of emergency note.

24:07.571 --> 24:09.196
What did they mean by "Prophet"?

24:10.157 --> 24:12.950
- No. Really?
- Yeah, yeah. That's what the angel said.

24:13.118 --> 24:16.078
- I don't want to be a Prophet.
- No, you don't at all.

24:16.288 --> 24:19.123
Gentlemen,
we gotta start running and hiding.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.834
Or do you want to tangle
with those wing-nuts twice?

24:22.002 --> 24:25.004
- Sorry, did you say, "we"?
- I'm on the angels' radar now.

24:25.172 --> 24:28.424
You think I don't need a little safety
in numbers?

24:28.592 --> 24:32.386
All right, we'll go to Rufus' cabin.
Kid can do his book report there.

24:51.114 --> 24:52.490
You know you're hungry.

24:52.657 --> 24:55.242
Why not enjoy yourself a Biggerson's
homemade pie bar?

24:55.452 --> 24:57.578
It's like a salad bar but with pie.

24:57.746 --> 24:59.997
Now back to our top story on News 10...

25:00.165 --> 25:02.124
...the search for the missing
Honor student.

25:02.292 --> 25:04.752
The victim
in this case reportedly insisted...

25:04.920 --> 25:06.420
...he'd been "Chosen by birthright"...

25:06.588 --> 25:09.632
...causing speculation that a cult
may be behind the abduction.

25:09.841 --> 25:11.383
The family car is also missing.

25:11.551 --> 25:13.844
Federal authorities
have been placed on alert.

25:14.012 --> 25:17.181
Again, 16-year-old
Honor student Kevin Tran...

25:17.349 --> 25:20.351
...reportedly taken from his
Michigan home early yesterday...

25:29.402 --> 25:31.362
Oh, crap.

25:35.242 --> 25:39.954
Hey. So we got another wrinkle.
Uh, looks like Kevin's gone missing...

25:40.121 --> 25:42.748
...and it's gone federal. Yeah.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.417
- Where's Meg?
- I'm here.

25:46.670 --> 25:49.880
- Great, so now we're kidnappers?
- Not if we shut up about it.

25:50.048 --> 25:51.966
Why. Who'd we kidnap?

26:01.726 --> 26:02.810
Oh, God.

26:03.019 --> 26:05.563
- What?
- Nothing.

26:05.730 --> 26:09.108
Nothing. Just my life.

26:09.276 --> 26:10.317
My future.

26:11.903 --> 26:13.904
Girlfriend.

26:14.072 --> 26:17.283
- My mom's car.
- Yeah? Yeah, Castiel, it's me.

26:17.450 --> 26:19.159
- Cass? Where? Where is he?
- Shut up.

26:19.327 --> 26:21.745
- I'll stop speaking.
- No, Cass, you talk.

26:21.913 --> 26:23.247
- I'm in Perth.
- Perth?

26:23.415 --> 26:26.125
- Perth? As in, Australia?
- What dogs?

26:26.293 --> 26:28.586
He says he's surrounded
by unhappy dogs.

26:28.753 --> 26:31.922
- They're chasing a rabbit around a ring.
- Oh, okay.

26:32.090 --> 26:33.591
He's at a dog track in Perth.

26:33.758 --> 26:35.634
I'm surrounded by large, unhappy dogs.

26:35.802 --> 26:37.803
They're unhappy
because the rabbit's fake.

26:37.971 --> 26:41.765
Listen, we're on Highway 94,
north of St. Cloud, Minnesota...

26:41.933 --> 26:44.560
...just passing mile marker 79.

26:51.610 --> 26:54.069
Kevin, this is Castiel.

26:56.698 --> 26:57.948
You're one of the angels?

27:02.621 --> 27:04.079
Boop.

27:05.081 --> 27:06.832
- Meg, are you hurt?
- Shut up.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.585
Cass, what happened back there?
Who were those guys?

27:09.753 --> 27:12.379
They're from the Garrison.
My old Garrison.

27:12.547 --> 27:17.593
Looks like Hester's taken over.
We were assigned to watch the Earth.

27:17.761 --> 27:19.470
Often it was boring.

27:19.638 --> 27:23.974
Your wars are very boring.
Sex. The repetition.

27:24.142 --> 27:27.728
Anyway. I was, uh... I was their captain.

27:27.896 --> 27:31.398
- Isn't that strange?
- Cass, why are they pissed at us now?

27:31.566 --> 27:33.734
Those racing dogs
were absolutely miserable.

27:33.902 --> 27:37.363
- They can only think in ovals...
- Cass! Don't make me pull this car over!

27:37.530 --> 27:40.407
- Why are angels after us?
- Are you angry? Why are you angry?

27:40.575 --> 27:42.284
No, I'm...

27:42.744 --> 27:44.828
Please, could we just stay on target?

27:45.413 --> 27:48.749
There's no reason for anger.
They're only following protocol.

27:48.917 --> 27:53.003
If the Word of God is revealed,
a Keeper of the Word will awaken.

27:53.171 --> 27:57.174
- Like this hot potato right here.
- Please, stop that.

27:57.342 --> 28:00.386
Anyway. Garrison code dictates...

28:00.553 --> 28:04.181
...you take the Keeper to the desert,
to learn the Word away from men.

28:04.349 --> 28:08.435
What kind of sense does that make?
He has to tell us, so that we can use it.

28:08.603 --> 28:10.396
God and his shiny red apples.

28:10.563 --> 28:13.315
I can't live in the desert.
I'm applying to Princeton!

28:13.525 --> 28:15.693
Okay, you know what?
Screw the Garrison.

28:15.860 --> 28:19.154
We need the tablet to end
Dick Roman's Soylent Us crap.

28:19.739 --> 28:23.200
If you want the Word, you'll have
to duck Hester and her soldiers.

28:23.368 --> 28:27.788
- We got you in our corner, right, Cass?
- Oh, I don't fight anymore.

28:27.956 --> 28:30.582
I watch the bees.

28:39.259 --> 28:42.511
Let's leave off angel-proofing sigils
or I'll be expelled too.

28:42.679 --> 28:46.306
Well, as long as we're invisible to your
Garrison buddies, it works for me.

28:47.434 --> 28:48.642
I'm sure you're hungry...

28:48.810 --> 28:52.187
...so once we get settled in upstairs,
we'll get some dinner going.

28:56.860 --> 28:58.777
This looks like a sex-torture dungeon.

29:01.406 --> 29:03.115
Is this a sex-torture dungeon?

29:03.825 --> 29:07.202
No, this is not a sex-torture...

29:07.370 --> 29:10.330
Get over here.
Sit down and read, would you?

29:17.255 --> 29:19.381
You seem troubled.

29:19.591 --> 29:23.886
Of course, that's a primary aspect of your
personality, so I sometimes ignore it.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.264
Okay. Um...

29:30.226 --> 29:32.728
Right now, I'm just wondering about you.

29:33.188 --> 29:34.271
What about me?

29:36.858 --> 29:39.902
You're worried about the burden
I lifted from you.

29:40.111 --> 29:42.321
I think I was done for.

29:45.492 --> 29:46.909
Do you see Lucifer?

29:48.661 --> 29:50.162
I did at first.

29:50.330 --> 29:55.834
But that was a projection of yours,
I think. Sort of an aftertaste.

29:56.920 --> 30:02.633
Now I more see... Well, everything.

30:05.053 --> 30:08.639
It's funny, I was... I was done for too.

30:08.807 --> 30:12.643
The weight of all my mistakes.

30:12.811 --> 30:16.522
All those lives and souls lost. I...

30:16.689 --> 30:20.192
I couldn't take it either. I was...

30:21.820 --> 30:27.658
I was lost. Until I took on your pain.

30:28.243 --> 30:30.202
Strange to think that that helped but...

30:30.370 --> 30:33.330
I know you never did anything
but try to help.

30:33.498 --> 30:38.085
I realize that, Cass.
And I'm grateful. We're all grateful.

30:38.253 --> 30:41.672
And we're gonna help you get better, okay?
No matter what it takes.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.049
What do you mean, "better"?

31:05.613 --> 31:06.655
Kevin?

31:06.823 --> 31:09.241
This is all too much.

31:09.409 --> 31:11.910
What's happened to my life?

31:12.078 --> 31:15.205
I'm just a kid from Michigan.
I didn't want to be a Word Keeper.

31:16.833 --> 31:19.418
Looks like we're brown-bagging it.

31:22.005 --> 31:26.758
I'm not prepared to factor
the supernatural into my world view...

31:26.926 --> 31:28.510
Okay, here we go.

31:28.720 --> 31:31.388
That's it, that's it. Just breathe.
Take it easy.

31:40.773 --> 31:45.360
I don't know, man, what can I say?
You've been chosen.

31:48.281 --> 31:51.408
And it sucks. Believe me.

31:54.078 --> 31:57.372
There's no use asking, "Why me?"
Because the angels...

31:57.540 --> 31:59.541
...they don't care.

32:01.252 --> 32:04.963
I think maybe they just
don't have the equipment to care.

32:10.345 --> 32:13.013
It seems like when they try, it just...

32:14.849 --> 32:16.808
...breaks them apart.

32:20.855 --> 32:25.567
I just want to be the first Asian-American
President of the United States.

32:29.113 --> 32:31.073
Then do your homework.

32:55.932 --> 32:58.308
See, I'm here. Just like I said.

32:58.476 --> 33:00.268
You better start talking, skank.

33:00.436 --> 33:03.939
Tell me again why I'm not just hauling
you off to the King's cash-window?

33:04.107 --> 33:07.192
Come on, Rosco.
I told you I've got something way better.

33:07.360 --> 33:09.486
You know how Crowley likes presents.

33:09.654 --> 33:13.907
He's not gonna care if we bring in
the Winchesters. Yesterday's news.

33:14.617 --> 33:16.576
Not the Winchesters.

33:16.744 --> 33:19.538
I've got the angel
who double-crossed him.

33:19.706 --> 33:21.248
I've got Castiel.

33:24.877 --> 33:28.005
Nah. Castiel, he's dead.

33:29.340 --> 33:31.633
Right. Because you're in that loop.

33:32.760 --> 33:34.136
Where is he then?

33:34.971 --> 33:38.181
First, I want to know how many
of you jerks I have to cut in.

33:40.393 --> 33:43.687
Think we're stupid?
We didn't tell anybody. Heh.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.355
I love demons.

34:25.646 --> 34:27.188
Didn't expect to see you back.

34:27.815 --> 34:31.109
Yeah, not without the King's army. Knife.

34:33.571 --> 34:34.612
Typical.

34:34.781 --> 34:38.116
I save our bacon and you're sitting here,
waiting by a Devil's Trap.

34:39.994 --> 34:42.161
Seriously, I just killed two
of Crowley's men!

34:42.330 --> 34:44.414
I could have gone the other way on that.

34:44.581 --> 34:49.085
It's true, incidentally.
There's other demons' blood on that blade.

34:51.255 --> 34:54.007
Look, I'm simpler than you think.

34:55.009 --> 34:58.220
I figured one thing out about this world.
Just one, pretty much.

34:58.429 --> 35:00.055
You find a cause and you serve it.

35:00.223 --> 35:02.349
Give yourself over and it orders your life.

35:03.434 --> 35:06.561
Lucifer and Yellow Eyes,
their mission was it for me.

35:06.729 --> 35:09.815
We should trust you because
you wanted to free Satan from Hell?

35:09.982 --> 35:14.319
I'm talking cause, douche bag.
As in reason to get up in the morning.

35:14.946 --> 35:18.782
Obviously these things shift over time.
We learn, we grow.

35:20.535 --> 35:23.787
Now, for me, currently,
the cause is bringing down the King.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.789
And I know I'll need help to do it.

35:25.957 --> 35:28.416
- Crowley ain't the problem.
- When you gonna get it?

35:28.584 --> 35:32.087
Crowley's always the problem.
He's just waiting for the right moment.

35:32.255 --> 35:36.925
I know what I'm supposed to do,
and it isn't screw with Sam and Dean.

35:37.093 --> 35:40.220
Or lose the only angel
who'd go to bat for me.

35:53.484 --> 35:56.820
This is good. Harmony. Communication.

35:57.363 --> 35:59.197
Now our only problem is Hester.

35:59.365 --> 36:02.033
- What?
- Well, here we're hidden from the Garrison.

36:02.201 --> 36:06.705
But when you killed the demon,
you put out a pretty clear beacon.

36:08.791 --> 36:10.917
We need better angel-proofing now.

36:13.337 --> 36:16.506
You took the Prophet from us?

36:18.009 --> 36:19.509
I'm sorry.

36:19.677 --> 36:25.098
- You have fallen in every way imaginable.
- Please, Castiel. We have to follow the code.

36:25.266 --> 36:28.435
- Help us do our work.
- He can't help you. He can't help anybody.

36:28.603 --> 36:31.229
We don't need his help.
Or his permission.

36:34.734 --> 36:36.651
The Keeper goes to the desert tonight.

36:38.070 --> 36:39.779
Whoa, whoa, whoa, back off!

36:39.947 --> 36:43.283
We're trying to clean up one
of your angel's messes. You know that.

36:43.451 --> 36:44.659
He's right.

36:44.827 --> 36:47.621
An angel brought the Leviathan
back into this world...

36:48.414 --> 36:51.750
...and they begged him,
begged him not to do it.

36:51.918 --> 36:56.087
Look, just give us some time, okay?
We will take care of your Prophet.

36:57.048 --> 36:59.799
Why should we give you anything?

36:59.967 --> 37:02.844
After everything you have taken from us?

37:03.054 --> 37:05.180
The very touch of you corrupts.

37:05.348 --> 37:08.850
When Castiel first laid a hand
on you in Hell, he was lost!

37:10.937 --> 37:13.897
For that, you're going to pay.

37:15.566 --> 37:18.652
Please. They're the ones
we were put here to protect.

37:19.946 --> 37:22.572
No, Castiel.

37:26.702 --> 37:29.871
No more madness! No more promises!

37:30.081 --> 37:31.915
No more new Gods!

37:36.796 --> 37:41.091
Hester, no. Please.
There's so few of us left.

37:44.929 --> 37:47.347
You wanted free will?

37:47.515 --> 37:49.891
Now I'm making the choices.

38:05.783 --> 38:07.158
What?

38:07.326 --> 38:08.994
Someone had to.

38:14.500 --> 38:17.460
These are strange times.

38:18.129 --> 38:21.298
I think they've always been.

38:22.174 --> 38:24.509
I wish you'd come with us.

38:24.677 --> 38:28.138
Oh, I'm not part
of the Garrison anymore, Inias.

38:28.306 --> 38:30.473
I'm sorry.

38:40.151 --> 38:44.070
Thanks, Kevin. Not a lot of people
could have handled this.

38:45.114 --> 38:47.532
You doing all right, there, "Chosen one"?

38:48.492 --> 38:51.786
- Yeah.
- Are you ready, Kevin Tran?

38:55.416 --> 38:57.584
Bring the Keeper to his home.

38:57.752 --> 39:00.337
We can watch over him there.

39:07.219 --> 39:12.432
- Well, I couldn't find Meg anywhere.
- Yes, well, she enjoys laying low.

39:15.853 --> 39:20.774
Here. "Leviathan cannot be slain
but by a bone of a righteous mortal...

39:20.941 --> 39:23.151
...washed in the Three Bloods
of the Fallen."

39:25.279 --> 39:26.613
Uh...

39:27.198 --> 39:30.992
It says we need to start
with the blood of a fallen angel.

39:34.872 --> 39:37.749
Well, you know me.

39:37.958 --> 39:40.710
Always happy to bleed
for the Winchesters.

39:47.718 --> 39:50.804
What are you gonna do, Cass?

39:51.514 --> 39:53.348
I don't know.

39:55.309 --> 39:56.810
Isn't that amazing?

40:02.525 --> 40:04.734
Well, let's get to work.

40:06.862 --> 40:10.115
We're doing everything we can,
Mrs. Tran, believe me.

40:10.282 --> 40:14.786
He said he'd had a seizure.
What if they hit him?

40:14.995 --> 40:16.663
What if he has a brain injury?

40:16.831 --> 40:18.665
You need to trust us, okay?

40:18.833 --> 40:20.667
It won't help to wear yourself out
with worry.

40:22.711 --> 40:24.170
- Mom?
- Kevin!

40:32.346 --> 40:35.390
- Who are you?
- It's okay, Mom. They brought me back.

40:35.558 --> 40:37.267
They're keeping me safe.

40:37.435 --> 40:39.644
I don't believe that's true.

40:40.896 --> 40:42.355
Rock beats scissor.

40:46.444 --> 40:48.528
Leviathan beats angel.

41:00.624 --> 41:02.208
Hello, Kevin.
