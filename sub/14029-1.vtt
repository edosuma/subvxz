02:19.072 --> 02:22.451
When do you think we'll get
approved for the birthing?

02:22.675 --> 02:24.416
Oh very soon I'm sure!

02:24.644 --> 02:26.180
We filled out all the
paperwork,

02:26.412 --> 02:28.323
went through all the
necessary steps,

02:28.548 --> 02:30.528
These things just take time...

02:30.750 --> 02:34.254
Yeah I know, I just...

02:34.521 --> 02:37.263
Oh how great it would be to

Citizen Daryl, and Citizen Norma?

03:15.128 --> 03:16.300

03:16.529 --> 03:21.205

living in heaven for...

03:21.434 --> 03:23.914
2O years now, correct?

03:24.137 --> 03:24.911
Yes sir

03:25.138 --> 03:29.382
Well congratulations sir!

03:29.609 --> 03:33.489

soul has been approved!

03:33.713 --> 03:35.659
So if you and your wife would
like to join me

03:35.882 --> 03:41.230
We have perpared a vehicle to go
to the birthing center right now!

03:41.454 --> 03:47.928
It's the messenger, he's come for us! Norma,

03:48.161 --> 03:50.539
Oh my god Daryl! We're

I love you too, and you're
going to be a great mother!

05:02.602 --> 05:07.017
It is now the time to start
the birthing process!

05:07.240 --> 05:11.017
Are you ready Citizen Norma?

05:11.244 --> 05:11.847
I am!

05:12.078 --> 05:15.252
Have you chosen a name for
him yet?

05:15.481 --> 05:18.360
Yes! We wish to call him...

05:18.918 --> 05:21.831
Marius! Little Marius!

05:22.055 --> 05:25.832
Do you two solemnly swear to
raise Marius in accordance

05:26.059 --> 05:29.802
with the texts that Caine
has provided us?

05:30.029 --> 05:31.269
Yes sir!

05:31.497 --> 05:34.706
Do you promise to keep marius
away from the wall

05:34.934 --> 05:38.040
and the evil one that dwells
behind it?

05:38.271 --> 05:40.376
Yes sir!

05:40.606 --> 05:44.952
It is your job to raise your
child up right here in heaven

05:45.178 --> 05:49.354
So that when God gets back,
which should be any day now,

05:49.582 --> 05:53.997
He can look in the eyes of our
newest citizen and know that

05:54.220 --> 05:57.827
they are ready to love
him unconditionally!

05:58.057 --> 06:02.062
Let us all thank Caine together!

06:07.200 --> 06:12.200
(crowd chanting)
Hail Caine! Hail Caine!

07:22.275 --> 07:24.983
This is where we keep
the worms babies

07:25.211 --> 07:28.715
We care for them until they're
ready to be harvested

07:28.948 --> 07:32.486
do you accept that
responsibility?

07:32.718 --> 07:35.096
We do, we do! We surely,
surely do!

07:35.321 --> 07:39.861
Yes! I'm so happy to be given
this honor! I've wanted this

07:40.092 --> 07:42.595
for as long as I can remember!

07:42.829 --> 07:46.743
Then look over at our inventory
and pick the one that looks

07:46.966 --> 07:48.172
the most beautiful to you

07:48.401 --> 07:53.111
take your time,
and choose wisely!

07:58.678 --> 08:02.182
Aaawww this one has
your mothers eyes!

08:02.415 --> 08:05.259
Eeww, this one's too messy!

08:07.320 --> 08:10.460
He-he, ooh, that one has too
much energy!

08:10.690 --> 08:12.761
- Eehhh, it's a little
bit too fat

08:12.992 --> 08:14.198
- That one's too bumpy

08:14.427 --> 08:15.963
-that one has too many veins

08:16.195 --> 08:16.866
- That one's too big!

08:17.096 --> 08:19.906
Aawaww, what's wrong with
that one?

08:20.132 --> 08:25.104
He's just tired, he's
been here for a long time

08:25.338 --> 08:28.547
Nobody has ever wanted him

08:28.774 --> 08:30.981
<i>aaawww, Gary“.!</i>

08:31.344 --> 08:34.223
aaww, poor fella!

08:34.447 --> 08:41.592
In a few days we will have
no choice but to put him down

08:41.821 --> 08:44.131
We want this one!

08:44.357 --> 08:48.999
Sweetie are you sure?
What about this one over here?

08:49.228 --> 08:52.971
You of all people should
understand, you're always trying

08:53.199 --> 08:59.809
to save those birds! I want to
save him, please daryl?

09:04.810 --> 09:10.726
Then lift little Marius into your
arms and present him to your peers!

10:31.130 --> 10:36.130
The process has successfully
completed!

11:07.233 --> 11:08.610
This is your home now

11:08.834 --> 11:11.178
you live here, with us!

11:11.404 --> 11:14.248
We're what's called, "Parents"

11:14.707 --> 11:16.914
We'll care for you, and love
you

11:17.143 --> 11:20.522
and teach you all about heaven until
you become a man of your ovvn

11:20.746 --> 11:23.886
and-and meet a woman!
and fall in love!

11:24.116 --> 11:26.687
And then, when you're
married for a while

11:26.919 --> 11:31.664
you'll get put on a list for
a child soul of your own!

11:34.760 --> 11:39.834
Look sweetie, he's taking a
liking to Caine already!

11:40.066 --> 11:42.842
That's our savior, Caine!

11:43.069 --> 11:45.675
He watches over us and keeps
us safe from the fiends that

11:45.905 --> 11:47.907
want to come back into heaven
but aren't allowed

11:48.140 --> 11:52.452
if it wasn't for him, none of us
would be able to exist right now

11:52.678 --> 11:58.685
He deserves all our love, all
our praise, and all our thanks.

11:58.918 --> 12:02.923
Come now don't overwhelm the boy
he's going to learn all that

12:03.155 --> 12:05.465
in the education center
tomorrow!

12:05.791 --> 12:08.397
I bet you're hungry little guy!

12:13.002 --> 12:17.141
You see Marius, you just put the
fork into the food, like so

12:17.369 --> 12:23.183
and then lift it up into your
mouth and chew, then swallow

12:23.409 --> 12:26.686
Do you understand?

12:26.912 --> 12:30.519
No, no dear, you have
to speak to him louder!

12:31.984 --> 12:34.965
MARIUS! PUT THE FORK...

12:35.187 --> 12:36.530
NO! THE FORK!

12:36.756 --> 12:38.997
INTO YOUR HAND!

12:39.258 --> 12:42.205
HHAAANNNDDD! YOUR HAND SEE!

12:42.428 --> 12:44.567
YOU HAVE TWO OF THEM!
LOOK!

12:44.797 --> 12:49.746
This is your bedroom. This is where
you'll sleep when it gets dark

12:49.969 --> 12:55.476
Sleeping is a time when we close
our eyes and rest for a while

12:55.708 --> 12:58.188
Caine says we need to rest our
eyes for a few hours a night

12:58.410 --> 13:02.916
Because too much exposure to
God's love can wear on the brain

13:03.149 --> 13:05.060
It needs time to rest...

13:05.284 --> 13:09.926
We love your Marius, and we're
so happy you're here!

13:33.913 --> 13:37.986
Ok son this is it! this is
where you'll be spending a

13:38.217 --> 13:40.993
great deal of time until you get
used to things

13:41.220 --> 13:45.168
You'll learn everything you need
to know to become a functioning

13:45.391 --> 13:46.802
member of our society

13:47.026 --> 13:49.131
It may seem a little
overwhelming at first

13:49.361 --> 13:54.140
but it will help everything make
more sense, I promise

14:30.502 --> 14:33.073
Alright class, please take
your seats

14:33.305 --> 14:37.151
My name is Mr Apple

14:37.643 --> 14:39.520
I'll be your teacher for the
next few yea rs

14:39.745 --> 14:42.589
Now if you turn your
information packets to page 3

14:42.815 --> 14:46.194
We will begin our lesson for
today!

15:58.290 --> 16:01.601
Hi, my name's Marius,
what's yours?

16:02.795 --> 16:04.866
Eden“.

16:05.097 --> 16:05.973
Well...Whatcha' looking at?

16:07.666 --> 16:09.577
<i>The wall...</i>

16:10.135 --> 16:13.173
Don't ya wonder what's behind it?

16:16.909 --> 16:22.825
The evil one and all her lies
dwell behind that wall...

16:23.215 --> 16:28.187
Our lord Caine built the wall to
keep her out forever

16:29.822 --> 16:34.703
You see... Caine and the Evil
One were once a team

16:34.927 --> 16:36.702
They built and founded
heaven together

16:36.929 --> 16:44.211
But our humble lord Cainejust couldn't
tolerate her deceitful ways any more...

16:44.436 --> 16:47.440
She wanted to use and
exploit us!

16:47.673 --> 16:50.153
So Caine did what he had to do!

16:50.376 --> 16:52.378
He did it for us!

16:52.611 --> 16:55.319
He cast her out that filth!

16:55.547 --> 16:58.084
So that we may live
here in peace!

16:58.317 --> 17:01.059
Let us all thank Caine!

17:23.442 --> 17:24.182
Look at you little guy!

17:24.410 --> 17:26.754
You look like you've made a full
recovery

17:26.979 --> 17:29.755
Marius! Come here son!

17:29.982 --> 17:33.088
Ok son, put him down

17:37.890 --> 17:40.370
Look at him fly!

17:40.893 --> 17:43.635
You see son, all life in heaven
is equal

17:43.862 --> 17:45.773
One creature is not more
important than the other

17:45.998 --> 17:51.004
we're all alive, and therefore,
we're all loved by God!

17:51.236 --> 17:53.546
And God's love is unconditional!

17:53.772 --> 17:59.051
So if you see one of God's creatures
in danger, it's your duty to help it!

17:59.278 --> 18:02.782
Then, some day, it
might help you back!

18:03.015 --> 18:06.827
Do you understand
what I mean Marius?

18:12.124 --> 18:14.434
Well Gee-wilkers Mr. Dentine

18:14.660 --> 18:18.699
Are you sure it's safe to be carrying
this child so close to the wall while

18:18.931 --> 18:22.310
holding a sign that says
"I Don't Love You Caine"?

18:22.534 --> 18:25.981
Sometimes you just gotta walk
on the wild side lil'johnny

18:26.205 --> 18:29.015
Caine ain't the boss of me!
I'm my own man...

18:29.241 --> 18:33.246
In fact, I'm thinking of maybe
even eating meat on fridays

18:33.479 --> 18:35.390
and slappin' my wife in the mouth!

18:35.614 --> 18:36.684
WOOOOOOOOOW!

18:36.915 --> 18:39.759
No Mr. Dentine, say it ain't so!

18:39.985 --> 18:45.094
Don't denounce Caine! don't do
it! Please don't do it!

18:49.695 --> 18:52.574
Oh no Mr. Dentine
it's the evil one!

18:52.798 --> 18:56.837
RRAAWWWRRR! I am The Evil One!

18:57.069 --> 19:01.484
I want to come into your homes
and corrupt your youth!

19:01.707 --> 19:06.850
And there's nothing any of you
can do about it! HAHAHAHA!

19:07.079 --> 19:09.753
Oh my god what have I done!

19:09.982 --> 19:19.104
If only I could turn back time! If only I could accept and
love Caine for the perfect, non-flawed individual that he is

19:19.858 --> 19:22.737
Stop right there you fiend!

19:23.996 --> 19:26.670
Holy fucking shit it's Caine!

19:26.899 --> 19:30.210
NO! I'm here to destroy
this place!

19:30.435 --> 19:33.882
I will have my way with all
the children!

19:34.106 --> 19:35.585
You will do no such thing!

19:35.807 --> 19:39.619
I cast you Back to the
place from which you came!

19:39.845 --> 19:43.884
No Caine, No! I love you! and
everything is my fault!

19:44.116 --> 19:49.589
You're so much better at everything,
and better looking than me too...

19:49.821 --> 19:53.132
Please take me back Cainey-pie!
PLEASE!

19:53.358 --> 19:53.836
GOODBYE! BITCH!

19:59.598 --> 20:05.913
Wow thank you ever so kindly Mr. Caine!
I will hereby love you forever!

20:06.138 --> 20:06.673
And do whatever you say!

20:06.905 --> 20:09.886
Ladies and gentlemen, don't take
pitty on her

20:10.108 --> 20:16.650
You will find that once the evil one's minions
have all been purged from our society

20:16.882 --> 20:24.323
that heaven will be a much
brighter, and better place

21:00.092 --> 21:03.972
Caine.. I love you like a father
loves his son...

21:04.196 --> 21:06.198
like a dog loves his master...

21:06.431 --> 21:09.969
like a man loves his lover...
I know that sounds wierd but

21:10.202 --> 21:12.978
I also know that you understand

21:13.205 --> 21:17.654
You see but you're blind without his light!
Where will you go?

21:17.876 --> 21:21.414
Who else will turn to in your
darkest hour?

21:21.647 --> 21:23.388
There is no choice!

21:23.615 --> 21:24.787
Accept the only way!

21:25.017 --> 21:28.430
Accept Caine into your heart and
you will understand the truth!

21:28.654 --> 21:34.002
For there is no love without Caine,
there is no life with out caine

21:34.226 --> 21:36.934
There is nothing without Caine!

21:37.162 --> 21:45.547
Hail Caine! Hail Caine! Hail Caine!
Hail Caine!

22:28.880 --> 22:32.657
Please little boy, I need
your help!

22:32.884 --> 22:37.060
I'm hurt badly!
It hurts so bad...

22:37.289 --> 22:42.329
I was trying to peak over the wall
and accidentally fell over...

22:42.561 --> 22:47.567
I think I broke my leg...
Please help!

23:03.215 --> 23:04.091

the matter?

23:04.316 --> 23:07.763

23:58.370 --> 24:02.443
save me before the evil
one gets me please!

24:02.674 --> 24:03.914
We need to help her!

24:04.643 --> 24:09.149
No-no-no-what? what? no! we
can't, we can't She'll get us!

24:09.381 --> 24:11.156
We just have to be quick...

24:11.383 --> 24:13.226
Hey you kids! get away
from there!

24:14.219 --> 24:16.062
Oh no! Run!!

24:16.288 --> 24:20.896
No Marius no! we can't leave her!
Marius no! let go of me! Let go of me!

24:21.126 --> 24:24.164
After them! Don't
let them escape!

24:24.396 --> 24:29.641
Search the area, make sure
nothing came through...

24:29.868 --> 24:33.008
Shit boss! where did
this hole come from?

24:33.238 --> 24:36.685
Get this hole sealed up
before anyone sees it

24:36.908 --> 24:40.412
Kill anything that
tries to come through

24:40.645 --> 24:42.591
You got it boss!

24:55.660 --> 25:01.042
They say when you go into it you
fall directly into her hand!

25:01.266 --> 25:09.208
And then she carries back to your home,
where she makes you murder all your pets!

25:09.441 --> 25:13.287
One... by... one!

25:17.215 --> 25:23.666
Well Marius and Eden,
how nice of you to join us!

25:23.889 --> 25:29.134
Sorry Mr Apple I'm not as good
as you are and I never will be.

25:29.361 --> 25:35.243
Mr Apple, I was just wondering
can animals... talk?

25:35.467 --> 25:40.212
Just take your seat now!

25:40.438 --> 25:47.253
Does that mean yes or no?

25:47.479 --> 25:51.188
You already know the answer
Marius

25:54.719 --> 25:56.596
Whoa! Oh man.. Eden!

25:56.821 --> 26:01.133
Whoa did you see that?
He was a big guy!

26:01.359 --> 26:03.703
Whoa! Oh man.. Eden!

26:03.929 --> 26:05.135
You know we have to go back
for that kitty, right?

26:05.363 --> 26:08.640
Are you sure it's such a good idea to
go on the other side of the wall Eden?

26:08.867 --> 26:12.508
All I know is that since I've
been here, nothing has felt right

26:12.737 --> 26:19.552
But when the kitty spoke to me I don't
know, I felt something different.

26:19.778 --> 26:21.280
Didn't you feel it?

26:21.513 --> 26:24.756
Whoa! Eden did you see that!

26:58.450 --> 27:03.399
We have to go back Marius!
We have to help that kitten!

27:04.923 --> 27:09.923
Hail Caine! Hail Caine!
Hail Caine! Hail Caine!

27:58.043 --> 28:00.387
Oh! you came back for me!

28:00.612 --> 28:03.601
Yeah just stay still we're going
to rescue you!

28:03.897 --> 28:08.931
Get back in here you little shit stain! or
we're gonna be forced to come and get you!

28:09.154 --> 28:14.194
You don't want that s0n!o the bushes!

28:15.093 --> 28:15.935
- Get back in here right now!

28:16.161 --> 28:24.307
- Hunt them down and kill them! Don't
come back unless you have their heads!

28:32.243 --> 28:34.161
- Here kitty, kitty, kitty here kitty,
kitty, kitty here kitty, come to papa!

28:34.161 --> 28:41.325
You see the fruit on the bush? eat some!
it will make you invisible!

28:41.500 --> 28:44.331
What? No way!

28:44.556 --> 28:49.403
They're special! watch
I'll eat some first!

29:11.082 --> 29:15.758
- They went this way!

29:15.987 --> 29:19.400
- Where ever you are, we
won't hurt you!

29:19.624 --> 29:22.240
- I think I heard them over there!

29:26.831 --> 29:28.640
Hurry eat the fruit!

29:29.817 --> 29:31.272
What? NO!

29:33.705 --> 29:36.948
- Come on fuck heads, this way!

30:12.577 --> 30:18.516
I bet you thought you got away didn't youl?
didn't you, you little shit stainl?

30:18.750 --> 30:22.220
No one escapes us!
NOBODY!

30:22.453 --> 30:27.596
We just want to take
you back to Caine!

31:17.709 --> 31:22.658
What the fuck is this? what the
fuck is this? Get them out of here!

32:10.628 --> 32:12.005
What happened?

32:12.230 --> 32:16.440
We got away, that's all
that matters!

32:16.668 --> 32:22.380
So tired... maybe we
should go back inside...

32:22.607 --> 32:27.556
Where did the hole go? it
was just right there...

32:27.779 --> 32:32.023
It closed to you, well for now
anyway

32:32.250 --> 32:36.255
Once the fruit wears off
you'll be allowed back inside

32:36.487 --> 32:39.593
What do we do until then?

32:39.824 --> 32:46.742
Let's go for a walk! Let me
show you around the world!

33:53.564 --> 33:56.602
What's in there?

33:57.802 --> 34:02.410
Come on, I'll introduce you!

34:36.607 --> 34:38.450
Hello...

34:41.179 --> 34:44.786
What are you doing out here?

34:45.016 --> 34:51.626
I'm trying to find my way back
into the garden...

34:52.590 --> 34:55.799
How did you end up getting
here?

35:01.599 --> 35:09.814
Along time ago...
God was a misfit...

35:10.942 --> 35:15.721
He chose to keep to himself and
he lived alone in the universe

35:15.947 --> 35:20.758
he created beautiful,
radiant stars, circled

35:20.783 --> 35:25.594
by tiny rocks made of
twigs and water...

35:26.757 --> 35:32.673
But they were all vacant, and
without any life...

35:33.631 --> 35:41.209
He was lonely, he wanted
to create something new

36:17.942 --> 36:22.942
He played with them non-stop having
every kind of adventure you can imagine

36:36.494 --> 36:39.668
Then when he exhausted all
possible outcomes

36:39.897 --> 36:46.405
He came to the conclusion that the
creatures he created were less than him...

36:46.637 --> 36:51.780
He could never learn from
them only teach them

36:52.009 --> 36:57.618
and for that reason, he could
never fully love them

36:57.848 --> 37:01.352
God wanted something new

37:01.586 --> 37:06.586
He wanted to create pure beauty
and find, love...

37:15.066 --> 37:22.644
She had curves... and an
opening instead of protrusion

37:22.873 --> 37:26.912
She was delicate and sweet

37:27.144 --> 37:30.853
all you hate to do was gaze
upon her once

37:31.082 --> 37:36.555
and for the rest of your life she would
be the one that emerges from the darkness

37:36.787 --> 37:40.633
Whenever you closed your eyes...

37:40.858 --> 37:50.677
Oh she was more beautiful than God, and now
he knew what it felt like to fall in love.

37:53.004 --> 37:57.714
But he wasn't the only one
who fell in love..

37:57.942 --> 38:02.220
And they loved me more than
they loved him..

38:20.865 --> 38:25.075
God learned something he
never knew about before...

38:27.772 --> 38:29.012
HEARTBREAK!

38:29.240 --> 38:33.620
And from heartbreak grew
jealousy...

38:33.844 --> 38:36.882
and from jealousy came anger...

38:37.114 --> 38:38.889
and finally to hatred!

38:39.116 --> 38:46.625
When god learned how to hate, he saw that the
very fabric of love could easily be broken...

38:46.857 --> 38:50.395
He didn't like the way
it made him feel...

38:50.628 --> 38:53.871
He began to destroy things!

38:54.098 --> 38:57.409
And I lost sight of
where he was...

39:23.461 --> 39:25.407
I was alone and scared...

39:25.629 --> 39:29.907
I loved god...
but in order to be together

39:30.134 --> 39:35.083
everything else must be
destroyed

39:35.306 --> 39:37.013
I am without him...

39:37.241 --> 39:38.311
and now...

39:38.542 --> 39:40.818
I AM NOTHING

39:42.213 --> 39:45.092
I wandered the universe alone

39:46.884 --> 39:50.832
Searching, and searching...

39:51.655 --> 39:56.661
and never finding anything...

40:03.893 --> 40:08.008
(painful screaming) What am I doing wrong?
No! What am I doing wrong?

41:03.197 --> 41:06.956
I didn't look at the creature
the way that god looked at me

41:08.032 --> 41:11.741
I wasn't upset that it wasn't
as smart as me

41:11.969 --> 41:15.815
I felt honored to teach it

41:16.040 --> 41:20.489
a companion that will be with
me forever

41:20.711 --> 41:24.955
and always looked up to me
because I came before it

41:25.182 --> 41:30.530
I discovered love

41:36.560 --> 41:38.164
I became infatuated
with them

41:38.395 --> 41:43.395
The way they moved... the way they
looked... the things they did...

41:49.240 --> 41:55.088
The noises they made...

41:58.282 --> 42:04.631
But... I made some...
mistakes...

42:04.855 --> 42:14.037
and after each mistake... they
became more terrified of me...

42:15.366 --> 42:17.243
until all of sudden.

42:17.468 --> 42:20.039
They forgot who I was...

42:20.271 --> 42:26.176
and they wanted nothing
more to do with me...

42:27.678 --> 42:32.889
God doesn't love me...
he doesn't love me...

42:33.117 --> 42:39.659
and they don't understand me...

42:39.890 --> 42:41.130
lam alone again...

43:14.425 --> 43:16.200
Do you know what make you
kids more comfortable?

43:16.427 --> 43:23.902
Peeling that synthetic misrepresentation
of flesh off of your soul...

43:24.134 --> 43:29.083
Watch, and do what I do!

43:49.193 --> 43:56.270
Oohhh! that feels so
much better!

43:56.500 --> 44:03.349
I can feel the pulsating sound of every
single solitary beam of light...

44:03.574 --> 44:08.216
penetrating every dripping
opening on my soul...

44:08.445 --> 44:16.796
sending shivering shivering bits of life
up and down the jelly in my back...

44:27.798 --> 44:32.770
Don't struggle little guy, you'll
get it stuck in the zipper...

44:33.003 --> 44:40.444
You don't want to get your
soul stuck in a zipper! OUCH!

46:33.924 --> 46:40.808
What the fuck are you doing out
of your house after curfew?

46:44.535 --> 46:45.502
I'm very disappointed in you
son!

46:45.736 --> 46:50.242
How many times have I told you not to
accidentally fall out of your window

46:50.474 --> 46:53.512
in the middle of the night and get into
some late night romantic adventure

46:53.744 --> 46:57.419
with the girl down the street that involves you
outrunning the OSWA evil prevention squad!

46:57.648 --> 47:00.527
There was an attack by the Evil
One's minions a little while ago!

47:00.751 --> 47:06.167
Don't you know we're at an evil alert level
magenta blue green circle square star?

47:06.390 --> 47:10.532
Thank you boys so much for
bringing our pride and joy home!

47:10.761 --> 47:15.767
You could have woke the neighbors up!
his lawn is already greener than mine!

47:15.999 --> 47:17.736
This is all I need!

47:18.229 --> 47:21.876
He was the runt of the litter the Messanger
warned us he'd be little bit off,

47:22.105 --> 47:23.812
would you like a cookie dear?

47:24.041 --> 47:25.520
It's ok ma'am, he's a good boy

47:25.742 --> 47:31.556
just keep him away from the windows until
he learns how to sleep a little bit better

47:31.782 --> 47:36.561
Oh you bet we will! Son, no
windows for a month!

47:36.787 --> 47:40.496
No, that's not fair, alright how
about a week?

47:40.724 --> 47:43.466
We can board them up together
like father and son!

47:43.694 --> 47:47.232
We better get going, keep that
little shit under control!

47:47.464 --> 47:54.313
If I ever catch him near the wall again, I
will be forced to use excessive brutal force

47:54.538 --> 47:55.983
ya hear me?

47:56.707 --> 48:01.486
Of course, thanks again
officers, here I'll see you out

48:09.419 --> 48:14.960
Oh Marius I'm so happy you're
home! I love you so much!

48:26.136 --> 48:29.640
Are you.. ok mom?

48:31.975 --> 48:34.888
Just fine dear! Now let's
get you ready for bed...

48:35.646 --> 48:36.852
Are you sure?

48:37.080 --> 48:42.553
I'm sure that it's the middle of the night
and it's way past your bedtime mister!

48:43.220 --> 48:44.631
No, no, no I mean about...

48:44.855 --> 48:46.994
Hey! You're not disobeying your
mother are you?

48:47.224 --> 48:54.039
Get to bed young man! You have a long day
of nailing your windows shut tomorrow!

48:54.264 --> 48:56.244
But dad!

48:56.466 --> 48:58.412
Move it buster!

49:01.071 --> 49:03.642
Remind him that you love him...
I love you son!

49:03.874 --> 49:08.721
Tell him that he's special...
You're a special boy Marius!

49:09.780 --> 49:14.661
You think I was too hard on him?
No you're a great father!

51:34.858 --> 51:39.102
Where am

51:39.629 --> 51:49.073
Awww, hush now my
little baby sit still.

51:49.306 --> 51:53.652
It will
all be over soon...

51:53.877 --> 51:56.824
What happened?

51:57.047 --> 52:02.047
You've fallen out of the graces
of your superiors my dear

52:08.425 --> 52:11.395
Who are you?

52:14.631 --> 52:17.669
Whoever you want me to be...

52:17.901 --> 52:18.845
He'll? me!

52:19.069 --> 52:22.607
Don't be afraid of them!

52:22.839 --> 52:30.849
They are refilling your
veins with new blood!

52:31.081 --> 52:37.498
Mmmmm, do you hear
that sound?

52:37.721 --> 52:45.162
That's how you know it's
still alive...

52:55.177 --> 52:59.144
mmmm it tastes like dreams!!

53:06.349 --> 53:09.956
Your life is meaningless

53:13.490 --> 53:18.490
You'rejust a slave race to a creature that
had it's back turned during your birth

53:33.843 --> 53:42.922
This pretty little face you're
wearing, it's just a fancy bag

53:43.153 --> 53:49.832
To hold all the liquids in...

53:50.794 --> 53:55.794
Once you're ego is disassembled you simply
find a new bag to wrap your liquids in

54:03.673 --> 54:08.673
you must decide your next form go deep
inside and summon the beast within

54:28.098 --> 54:33.275
you're nothing more than an
animal with a broken leg

54:33.503 --> 54:38.503
limping your way through life
one pathetic step at a time

55:30.093 --> 55:34.041
Your friend escaped here
with hidden knowledge

55:34.264 --> 55:37.837
You must find him

55:38.068 --> 55:44.508
and you must kill him...

55:44.741 --> 55:51.590
The others won't see
you as you really are

55:51.815 --> 55:56.815
Now you'rejust like
me an animal...

56:04.861 --> 56:11.210
Well howdy there strangers, welcome to
Caine's worship kiddie round up ranch!

56:11.434 --> 56:15.211
Say I don't know about ya'll but
I feel like singing a song!

56:15.438 --> 56:20.979
How 'bout it lolipop? Would you
like to sing a song for the kids?

56:21.611 --> 56:24.615
Lolipop? Lolipop where are ya?

56:24.848 --> 56:27.260
I'm over here Uncle T!

56:27.484 --> 56:28.622
Overwhere?

56:28.852 --> 56:29.728
I'm right over here!

56:29.953 --> 56:32.456
Well what in Caine's name are
you doing over there?

56:32.689 --> 56:39.368
Oh! Uncle T it's wonderful! You've got to
come over here! Caine is speaking to me!

56:39.596 --> 56:41.132
Caine is doing what?

56:41.364 --> 56:46.973
Oh Uncle T! Caine is speaking to me right
now, and you can't interupt Caine!

56:47.203 --> 56:50.650
Look! Come sit down with me and you can
hear him speak too it's wonderful!

56:50.874 --> 56:54.014
Oh no! UncleT look!

56:54.244 --> 56:58.317
What is it? ls Caine gonna
tell us something again?

56:58.548 --> 57:03.657
Aw, I think so Uncle T, it's a
dead baby bird EW!!

57:07.624 --> 57:12.801
Oh that's terrible! But you know something,
I think Caine can speak to us through

57:13.029 --> 57:20.345
that little dead bird, you wanna know why?
-vvwhhhyyy?

57:20.570 --> 57:25.610
Because Caine knows every time a little
tiny baby bird dies and falls to the ground

57:25.842 --> 57:29.153
But he leaves it there to show
us how much he loves us

57:29.379 --> 57:33.589
and how much the Evil One
hates us!

57:33.817 --> 57:35.990
Oh I hate that Evil One Uncle T!

57:36.219 --> 57:39.757
You see Marius? You see what
happens when you leave the house?

57:39.989 --> 57:43.163
- We all do Iolipop! hey
watch out!

57:43.393 --> 57:49.776
Don't let those ants bite! Caine provided
us with those ants so they can eat the dead

57:49.999 --> 57:55.677
things and we won't have to look at
their ugly corpses all over the place!

57:55.905 --> 58:01.378
- Oh I would have to trip over my dead
sinning grandpa on the way to church!

58:01.611 --> 58:08.085
Exactly Lolipop! So you see
Caine thought of everything!

58:08.318 --> 58:11.629
What happened? Norma?
NORMA!

58:11.888 --> 58:15.461
Norma what are you doing?
Marius don't look!

58:15.692 --> 58:17.797
Why, What's going on dad??

58:18.027 --> 58:23.272
Don't look cover your eyes! -Please Daryll!
Please help me!

58:44.153 --> 58:48.101
Dad why aren't we helping Mom?
What's going on??

58:48.324 --> 58:56.766
You don't understand Marius... couples... they
don't see each other without their clothes on

58:57.000 --> 59:05.146
What? Why? it's one of the rules, GEEZ! What are they
teaching you in those schools..

59:05.375 --> 59:07.946
But we can't just let her suffer
in there dad!

59:08.177 --> 59:13.422
It's Heaven son, there's
no suffering in Heaven!

59:14.617 --> 59:17.154
Dad that's Mom we
have to do something!

59:25.261 --> 59:28.333
How about some ice cream?

59:43.680 --> 59:47.253
How is it? Marius, is it
good?

59:47.483 --> 59:51.556
I don't know dad! I'm not exactly in
the mood for ice cream right now...

59:51.788 --> 59:54.735
Ah sure you are! It's always
a good time for ice cream!

59:54.958 --> 1:00:01.705
Ice scream, you scream, we all
scream for ice cream! ha ha ha!

1:00:01.931 --> 1:00:07.176
Seriously though don't ever scream
unless you're really in danger

1:00:07.403 --> 1:00:09.508
Otherwise people are not
going to believe you!

1:00:09.739 --> 1:00:12.379
Can we at least check on mom?

1:00:12.775 --> 1:00:15.779
Hun, do you have any
clothes on yet??

1:00:16.012 --> 1:00:22.861
- Ooww! Daryl please! Daryl!!
Daryl help me!

1:00:23.086 --> 1:00:27.125
We better wait a little while she
sounds like shes in a mood right now!

1:00:27.357 --> 1:00:30.634
- Please! Please Stop!

1:00:41.004 --> 1:00:45.350
Ha! well look at you,
all better?

1:00:45.575 --> 1:00:51.821
Good sir, could you possibly spare some
bread for a bird down on his luck?

1:00:52.048 --> 1:00:54.085
Marius, that wasn't funny!

1:00:54.317 --> 1:00:59.630
Hey! Hey! hey! Down here! -What the ff...
Take a look down good man

1:00:59.856 --> 1:01:04.134
You can talk??Of course I can! Didn't
they teach you anything in school sir

1:01:04.360 --> 1:01:09.537
No! Well I mean.. maybe..

1:01:09.766 --> 1:01:14.181
Hey relax, no big deal! maybe they just
forgot, I mean they forgot to teach

1:01:14.404 --> 1:01:17.510
your son about the thing with the naked
ladies!

1:01:17.740 --> 1:01:22.883
Your wife is in the other room giving
birth to something rather fierce

1:01:23.112 --> 1:01:25.092
You should really get
in there and help her.

1:01:25.314 --> 1:01:32.960
But bird... I can't get in there
while her... squidlypie is out!

1:01:33.189 --> 1:01:38.605
I'm sure that under the circumstances
you'd be forgiven for your trespasses

1:01:38.828 --> 1:01:42.970
Can you just maybe go in there and
make sure the Evil One isn't in there?

1:01:43.199 --> 1:01:46.942
You have my word good sir there is
no one of evil descent currently

1:01:47.170 --> 1:01:52.848
occupying your living room! just the
beauty and magic of child birth

1:01:53.076 --> 1:01:54.987
do go inside and see, go on!

1:01:55.211 --> 1:02:00.923
Please? Fine then, I'll
play along wait here!

1:02:05.555 --> 1:02:10.300
Hhmmm yes sir, everything
seems to be in order here!

1:02:10.526 --> 1:02:15.407
Son, I want you to get
out of here and get help

1:02:15.631 --> 1:02:16.200
but, but dad they're gonna..

1:02:16.432 --> 1:02:24.442
I know, it doesn't matter, we
have to help your mother, so go

1:02:24.674 --> 1:02:26.813
Alright, I love you dad!

1:02:28.244 --> 1:02:31.054
I love you too son...

1:02:31.380 --> 1:02:39.299
So clearly Caine is telling us that as long as
you stay here with him, you'll never ever die!

1:02:46.963 --> 1:02:49.000
Help me please! Please I need
somebodies help!

1:02:49.232 --> 1:02:51.473
My Morn is naked and my
Dad is talking to birds!

1:02:51.701 --> 1:02:55.478
Help me please! Help! Help! Please anybody!
Somebody help me!

1:02:55.705 --> 1:02:59.278
Caine I want to thank you for being
there for me, when nobody else was!

1:02:59.509 --> 1:03:02.820
You helped me go on!
You save me from the darkness!

1:03:03.045 --> 1:03:05.355
You saved me from drowning
in the darkness!

1:03:05.581 --> 1:03:10.462
He's like the slug that's going over
the razors blade with his slime

1:03:10.686 --> 1:03:18.503
but he's doing it with angel bite bro! Oh man
dude! He's got it figured out! I see him once

1:03:18.728 --> 1:03:24.940
Well not really but, you know what? He comes
to me at night and he gives me good ideas

1:03:25.168 --> 1:03:29.446
He tells me, "go preach my word
brotha and I'll look at fiarya"

1:03:29.672 --> 1:03:36.248
oowvv! ooww! Daryl! Please! there's
something coming out of me!

1:03:36.479 --> 1:03:38.254
Please do something!
Please it hurts!

1:03:38.481 --> 1:03:43.294
Hey sweetie... -Ow! Daryl!!
Owl! You doing ok?

1:03:43.519 --> 1:03:49.902
Daryl! Daryl Please! get it out of me!
get it out of me!

1:03:50.126 --> 1:03:57.135
Can I get you a drink,
or a cool towel or something?

1:03:57.366 --> 1:04:01.508
Daryl! Daryl I spoke to God!

1:04:01.737 --> 1:04:03.614
Oh yeah?

1:04:04.640 --> 1:04:07.280
He's not coming back...

1:04:07.610 --> 1:04:12.923
What?! Did he say why? It
wasn't something I said was it?

1:04:13.149 --> 1:04:19.065
He's not coming back because
this isn't heaven...

1:04:19.288 --> 1:04:23.566
And now I have demon inside
of me...

1:04:23.793 --> 1:04:25.272
A demon?

1:04:25.494 --> 1:04:34.573
Daryl... Daryl please get it
out of me! Get it out of me!

1:04:40.710 --> 1:04:42.951
Oh heavens me!

1:04:55.725 --> 1:04:59.537
Help me! Help me! Help me! My
daddy's talking to birdys!

1:04:59.762 --> 1:05:02.902
My mommy's running
around naked!

1:05:30.359 --> 1:05:34.364
Stop right there! Put down the
weapon or prepare to be slaughtered!

1:06:17.340 --> 1:06:22.340
Ow fuck! Ow fuck! Somebody help me!
Somebody help me!

1:06:33.089 --> 1:06:42.009
Code dark gray! code dark gray! Deploy
plan X! Outbreak extermination!

1:07:25.141 --> 1:07:30.141
Daryl! Daryl! Ha ha ha! d-d-d-daryl!
Wake up Daryl! Daryl wake up!

1:07:35.951 --> 1:07:38.454
Wakey Wakey Daryl! Daryl...

1:07:40.723 --> 1:07:45.502
I need you to do something for me,
your wife is a very special lady

1:07:45.728 --> 1:07:46.763
and she is carrying something
of great value!

1:07:46.996 --> 1:07:54.278
But it's too heavy to carry on my own,
can you bring it somewhere for me?

1:07:54.503 --> 1:07:56.642
What are you talking about?

1:07:58.674 --> 1:08:02.850
- Please good sir, you've always
helped us birds in the past!

1:08:04.814 --> 1:08:07.522
What is it?

1:08:08.551 --> 1:08:10.121
It's a surprise!

1:08:10.352 --> 1:08:12.593
What do I do?

1:08:12.822 --> 1:08:16.599
Go into the kitchen, get
yourself a knife!

1:08:16.826 --> 1:08:21.798
A great big sharp shiney one! How
about one of those new ones you

1:08:22.031 --> 1:08:24.944
ordered the other day
from that magazine?

1:08:25.167 --> 1:08:30.173
Oh yes, the one that had that really neat
video where they cut the tin cans in half!

1:08:30.406 --> 1:08:31.680
Well now what do I do?

1:08:31.907 --> 1:08:35.821
Aw yeah, take it into the living
room, take off all your clothes

1:08:36.045 --> 1:08:40.824
You don't want to get her sticky juices on them,
now do you? After all, cleanliness is next

1:08:41.050 --> 1:08:48.867
to godliness, you want to look back
when God comes back, don't you? Eh?

1:08:56.765 --> 1:09:00.907
Lay down next to her and hold
her in your arms, yes!

1:09:01.337 --> 1:09:07.618
Don't worry sweetie, the talking
bird says it's going to be ok!

1:09:11.680 --> 1:09:18.859
Comfy isn't it? Go on now, don't be bashful! Rub
against her a little, at least a bit until you

1:09:19.088 --> 1:09:22.501
feel the tingling, that's God's way of
rewarding you for a life well lived!

1:09:22.725 --> 1:09:26.571
That's love Daryl! That's love!
yes!

1:09:30.232 --> 1:09:33.805
This feels... kinda nice...

1:09:34.036 --> 1:09:37.882
Oh yes I bet it does! Why My good sir it
even looks as though you are glowing!

1:09:38.107 --> 1:09:42.385
Not a shy one I see! She's like putty in
your hands! Now you've got her wrapped

1:09:42.611 --> 1:09:46.889
around your little finger! She trusts you
completely! You can raise that knife up

1:09:47.116 --> 1:09:52.964
and make an opening for that abomination
to rip it's way into this world!

1:09:55.858 --> 1:10:00.864
Oh yes! rip it out!
Rip it out!

1:10:16.045 --> 1:10:19.993
Quick don't let it escape, chase
after it!

1:10:22.384 --> 1:10:26.992
I love you Norma! I'll be
back soon I promise!

1:10:39.501 --> 1:10:44.007
Quick! Go now, chasey
chasey!

1:10:58.687 --> 1:11:04.000
Cut them all in half! Gut
them like pigs! ha ha ha!

1:11:06.095 --> 1:11:10.976
Kill them! Kill them!
Butcher these damn cunts!

1:11:17.006 --> 1:11:20.647
Wanna fuck with me? I'll show
you who you're fucking with!

1:11:20.876 --> 1:11:23.482
Eat my fucking steel you
fat fuck!

1:11:23.712 --> 1:11:26.989
Slaughter them all! Slaughter
the flesh bags! Fuck em up!

1:11:27.216 --> 1:11:32.791
Kill them! kill them all!
Kill them! kill them all!

1:11:47.836 --> 1:11:51.818
You again? Where are
your parents boy?

1:11:54.910 --> 1:12:01.020
Please lord! Please descend from the
sky on your diamond studded chariot

1:12:01.250 --> 1:12:06.359
Pulled by four white horses that can
fly with angel wings of their own!

1:12:06.588 --> 1:12:14.666
Please lord! Please come down from
the sky and take me back with you!

1:12:23.572 --> 1:12:30.512
Oh my lord, is that you? Have you
come for me? Have come back?

1:12:30.746 --> 1:12:33.920
Is the waiting over?

1:12:34.149 --> 1:12:38.757
Ma'am we found your son wandering the streets
muttering something about his mother

1:12:38.987 --> 1:12:43.197
walking around with no cloths on
in the privacy of her own home

1:12:43.425 --> 1:12:46.770
which is an offense punishable
by exile, is this true?

1:12:46.995 --> 1:12:49.737
I met god tonight...

1:12:55.571 --> 1:13:03.149
Fucking hell... -!Sir the boy's mother has an exit
wound between her legs, how should we proceed?

1:13:03.946 --> 1:13:10.886
Right, citizen Norma, due to high treason your
right to exist in this world has been revoked

1:13:11.120 --> 1:13:13.964
prepare to be evacuated!

1:13:15.224 --> 1:13:20.224
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine,
you make me happy when skies are gray

1:13:28.003 --> 1:13:33.003
You never know dear, how much I love
you, please don't take my sunshine away

1:14:00.269 --> 1:14:08.780
Didn't I tell ya? I told ya! yeah
who is the motherfucking man?

1:14:10.846 --> 1:14:17.024
I'm the motherfucking man! oh yeah!
who's the man? Who is the man?

1:14:17.252 --> 1:14:22.252
The man, is Caine! It's Caine! Go Caine!
It's Caine! Go Caine!

1:15:03.799 --> 1:15:07.906
Uummm h-hello?

1:15:10.172 --> 1:15:16.487
How could you? This world I
provided for you isn't enough?

1:15:16.712 --> 1:15:22.526
You still had to go crawling
back to her

1:15:22.751 --> 1:15:24.992
I-I don't understand...

1:15:25.220 --> 1:15:29.691
No matter what I do...
No matter what I give you

1:15:29.925 --> 1:15:37.104
You all still end up loving her
more, I just don't understand

1:15:37.332 --> 1:15:41.337
I just wanted to help the hurt kitty,
I was trying to do the right thing...

1:15:41.570 --> 1:15:45.780
You have brought lies into
heaven!

1:15:46.008 --> 1:15:51.008
But I understand Marius, more than you
think. I understand the allure she can have

1:15:56.485 --> 1:16:02.128
But do you know what? She
will turn on you Marius

1:16:02.357 --> 1:16:09.241
She will guide you down the wrong
path, and then she will turn on you

1:16:09.464 --> 1:16:15.779
You know since you have come in
here you haven't praised me once

1:16:16.004 --> 1:16:21.010
How am I supposed to know
that you love me?

1:16:21.243 --> 1:16:22.881
Didn't mean for any of
this to happen, I'm sorry!

1:16:23.111 --> 1:16:25.455
Aaannnnnddd?

1:16:25.681 --> 1:16:31.290
And, I uh, think you're.. much...
you're much...uhh

1:16:31.520 --> 1:16:32.260
Prettier...

1:16:32.487 --> 1:16:34.967
P-p-rettier... than-

1:16:35.190 --> 1:16:37.101
You must never speak her
name outloud!

1:16:37.326 --> 1:16:44.073
Saying her name is like admitting
she exists, it feeds into her ego!

1:16:44.299 --> 1:16:48.179
Show me, how you pray!

1:16:48.403 --> 1:16:54.115
Are you going to stop fucking lying to me?
Are you? Tell me the Truth!

1:16:54.343 --> 1:16:56.050
What do you want to know? I'll
tell you anything!

1:16:56.278 --> 1:17:03.787
Tell me what her voice sounds like... Did
she comfort you? What did she say about me?

1:17:04.019 --> 1:17:09.196
I don't know dude! Something about
worms, and these lights Bitch was crazy!

1:17:09.424 --> 1:17:16.808
You actually spoke to her? You actually
spoke to her? You ate her fucking fruit?

1:17:17.032 --> 1:17:19.842
That doesn't surprise me!

1:17:20.068 --> 1:17:25.984
You know there was once a time when she loved
me, and as hard as I try to keep her out

1:17:26.208 --> 1:17:30.247
a part of me always wishes she would
try to break back the fuck in

1:17:30.479 --> 1:17:33.915
She's like the ghost of girl
that's still alive

1:17:34.149 --> 1:17:40.964
I am haunted by her, and I love
her, as much as I hate her

1:17:57.806 --> 1:18:03.222
...and there she was... The most
beautiful creature I had ever seen

1:18:03.445 --> 1:18:10.124
a tall slender girl with long
strawberry blonde hair

1:18:10.352 --> 1:18:12.798
and lips that only knew
how to speak my name.

1:18:13.021 --> 1:18:22.669
I knew that every moment of my time
here, must be spent only with her...

1:18:23.932 --> 1:18:27.641
Hey there...

1:18:28.570 --> 1:18:32.245
I never felt anyone
who feels like you do

1:18:33.542 --> 1:18:38.355
Your skin, your lips

1:18:38.580 --> 1:18:41.390
You my dear, are perfect

1:18:42.150 --> 1:18:48.931
oohhh! I love the sounds
that come out of your mouth!

1:18:50.625 --> 1:18:54.607
I could just lay here and talk
to you all night long

1:18:54.830 --> 1:19:01.179
I feel so safe with you! Like
nothing bad could everhappen!

1:19:03.305 --> 1:19:06.343
Why are the others afraid
of me?

1:19:06.575 --> 1:19:12.082
Well that's because you're different, they don't
understand you the way that I do.

1:19:13.915 --> 1:19:18.921
The fruit, maybe that's the
-answer!

1:19:20.122 --> 1:19:25.162
Can you help me get the others
to eat it?

1:19:25.393 --> 1:19:28.431
How can you say no to
those eyes?

1:19:30.499 --> 1:19:35.499
Oh your beauty! Nothing compares to your
beauty, in anything in the universe!

1:19:42.344 --> 1:19:51.526
Thank you! Yes! You're too kind! Thank you!

1:19:53.722 --> 1:19:56.464
I don't like it when the
other ones eat your fruit...

1:19:56.691 --> 1:19:57.897
What do you mean?

1:19:58.126 --> 1:20:00.606
It just doesn't make me
feel very good

1:20:00.829 --> 1:20:07.439
That's no fair to every one else,
it would be selfish not to share!

1:20:07.669 --> 1:20:11.674
And suddenly I don't
feel so special anymore

1:20:51.947 --> 1:20:56.828
I don't mean to cause alarm, but
I can't stop thinking about you

1:20:57.052 --> 1:21:04.971
I'm glad I finally got you alone I need you. I
can't get your very image from inside my brain

1:21:05.193 --> 1:21:08.504
Such wonderess curves, those luscious lips with
your forests of long

1:21:08.730 --> 1:21:12.974
tangly orange hair and that piercing
way that you look deep inside my eyes!

1:21:13.201 --> 1:21:19.311
It's as if you can see all the way into
my soul! You just drive me insane!

1:21:19.541 --> 1:21:23.683
You bring something out of me! You
give me this weird tickling itch

1:21:23.912 --> 1:21:28.122
but no matter how hard I
scratch I just can't sooth it!

1:21:28.350 --> 1:21:33.231
It's becoming swollen, please
just touch it for me! Please!

1:21:33.455 --> 1:21:36.629
What? Get off of me!

1:21:36.858 --> 1:21:40.704
I'll do anything for you! I would
slice apart the tallest mountain

1:21:40.929 --> 1:21:47.210
behead the beast of your choosing! I would even
walk on water if it prevented you from drowning

1:21:47.435 --> 1:21:52.714
Now how about we get to know
each other a little better!

1:22:03.451 --> 1:22:09.094
Stop! Stop it! Oh!
Please! Stop it!

1:22:10.392 --> 1:22:13.703
What's that?

1:22:15.030 --> 1:22:19.342
One by one they all found their way to the top of
the hill that day

1:22:19.567 --> 1:22:25.176
Partaking in every pleasure
that this place had to offer.

1:22:25.407 --> 1:22:28.616
Binging and purging all at once

1:22:28.843 --> 1:22:36.660
She just opens up her legs and she
radiates a brand new set of colors

1:22:36.885 --> 1:22:39.991
that nobodies ever known before

1:22:41.523 --> 1:22:47.269
Then you fall in love with her when you realize
that the others only project the colors

1:22:47.495 --> 1:22:50.203
that you have already seen!

1:23:05.447 --> 1:23:12.695
God?! is that you? Is it really you?

1:23:41.149 --> 1:23:47.998
And that was the day the sky
opened up and God created death

1:23:48.223 --> 1:23:53.172
It rained down from the heavens in
a fiery load of passion and filth!

1:23:53.395 --> 1:23:58.708
Those who chose to sacrifice their virginal beauty to
their whore Goddess

1:23:58.933 --> 1:24:03.040
were stripped of their identities and forced to
remain on their scorched

1:24:03.271 --> 1:24:07.720
planet as carcoal stained doves

1:24:07.942 --> 1:24:11.355
She claimed that she was
more beautiful than God

1:24:11.579 --> 1:24:15.584
But death was more beautiful than her

1:24:15.817 --> 1:24:24.032
and as his last piece of revenge, god decided that
she would never be-allowed to die

1:24:24.259 --> 1:24:31.404
No! What have you done? Damn you! DAMN YOU!

1:24:32.500 --> 1:24:37.415
I hope you enjoy living in this pit
alone for the rest of eternity.

1:24:37.639 --> 1:24:40.882
I am going to erase you

1:24:41.109 --> 1:24:44.215
From this moment on you do not exist to me

1:24:44.446 --> 1:24:47.290
Now leave me alone!

1:24:48.917 --> 1:24:52.296
But I wasn't the only one left alive

1:24:52.520 --> 1:24:57.833
A lot of us had survived and we had all seen that
thing in the sky together

1:24:58.059 --> 1:25:02.940
We knew who it was, and that someday it would be
back for us

1:25:03.164 --> 1:25:11.310
Until then we must worship, respect, and most of all
we must fear it

1:25:11.539 --> 1:25:13.678
But we didn't all see eye to eye

1:25:13.908 --> 1:25:17.754
Some believed that her! Fruit had a lot of good to
offer

1:25:17.979 --> 1:25:21.085
That much could be
learned from it

1:25:21.316 --> 1:25:27.824
We reached an agreement. Those that wanted to
live a pure god loving life came with me

1:25:28.056 --> 1:25:36.237
The rest chose to remain in the forest like animals,
constantly blinded by the color of her lies

1:25:36.464 --> 1:25:46.351
Caine? Caine? Caine? Are you There? Caine? Can you
hear me? Hello?

1:25:46.574 --> 1:25:52.752
What for fucks sake?! I am trying to tell a story down
here!

1:25:52.981 --> 1:25:55.621
Sorry sir, but we found the
boys father

1:25:55.850 --> 1:26:02.199
He was just seen scaling the wall and
he was.. naked.. and carrying something

1:26:02.423 --> 1:26:09.534
Well fan-fucking-tastic! Just what I need! And on
top of it all I lost my fucking place

1:26:09.764 --> 1:26:12.745
in the fucking story!
-Sorry sir!

1:26:12.967 --> 1:26:15.504
Go over the wall and get him!

1:26:15.737 --> 1:26:17.546
Uh... are you.. are you sure?

1:26:17.772 --> 1:26:22.152
You heard me! Put on your little helmet and climb
into the big boy seat of that

1:26:22.377 --> 1:26:27.759
great big fucking tank I got you and
wipe him off the face of this planet!

1:26:27.982 --> 1:26:31.691
You got that you dumb fuck?
-Sir, yes sir!

1:26:34.022 --> 1:26:36.229
Where am I?

1:26:36.457 --> 1:26:39.131
You're waking up out of your dream

1:26:39.360 --> 1:26:40.873
Where's that breathing coming from?

1:26:41.095 --> 1:26:42.665
Your lungs Daryl

1:26:42.897 --> 1:26:45.605
Where's Marius? Where's Norma?

1:26:45.833 --> 1:26:49.110
Don't worry about them! They're both fine!
Probably gathered around the telly watching their

1:26:49.337 --> 1:26:56.551
loolo on the evening news helping out his bird friends!
Wonderful human interest story, don't ya think?

1:26:56.778 --> 1:27:01.158
There seem to be a lot of animals out here tonight,
don't you think?

1:27:01.382 --> 1:27:03.328
Just ignore them and keep moving!

1:27:03.551 --> 1:27:05.224
Why are they watching me?

1:27:05.453 --> 1:27:10.266
Because they hate you and they want to taste your
stringy flesh!

1:27:14.963 --> 1:27:17.409
I don't like the way it's
eyes are looking at me!

1:27:17.632 --> 1:27:20.670
Just shut up will ya, you're too stupid for this
conversation!

1:27:20.902 --> 1:27:22.074
Just keep moving!

1:27:22.303 --> 1:27:24.305
-!I want to be it's friend!

1:27:25.373 --> 1:27:29.913
But I don't know how to communicate with it

1:27:30.144 --> 1:27:31.953
Why did he do this?

1:27:32.180 --> 1:27:38.028
Why would he put all of us in the same
place and not let us talk to each other?

1:27:38.920 --> 1:27:45.098
Look you disgustings waste of flesh the only way
I can get out of here is through God's door

1:27:45.326 --> 1:27:50.332
but I need him to open it first. Now you're either
going to help me do that

1:27:50.565 --> 1:27:56.015
or my friends are going to hold you down and I'm going
to peck the fucking eyes out of your big stupid skull

1:27:56.237 --> 1:28:01.949
Do you understand what I'm saying or should I
cleverly word it into a sitcom script

1:28:02.176 --> 1:28:06.283
so that your feeble little
brain can process it easier?

1:28:06.514 --> 1:28:12.192
I don't feel so good...
everything looks so weird!

1:28:12.420 --> 1:28:18.462
Do you think you're the first man to travel down this
path ofelightenment?

1:28:18.693 --> 1:28:20.695
Do you think you're something special

1:28:20.928 --> 1:28:28.005
If you were rotting on the side of the road
I wouldn't even stop to eat your face meat

1:28:35.143 --> 1:28:40.143
Shut up! shut up! Stop talking to me! Shut up! shut
up! Stop it! Leave me alone!

1:28:53.094 --> 1:29:00.034
Why don't you just kill them Daryl? Kill them!

1:29:00.268 --> 1:29:06.344
Draw a weapon fromyour side
and slaughter them one by one

1:29:07.575 --> 1:29:11.079
Kill them daryl! KILL THEM DARYL!

1:29:11.312 --> 1:29:15.419
Kill them, and eat them! Chew the meat off their
boned

1:29:15.650 --> 1:29:19.120
Taste their souls!

1:29:19.354 --> 1:29:26.135
Stop it! Get out of here! Just leave me alone! Leave
me alone!!

1:29:26.361 --> 1:29:31.361
Daryl stop crying! Daryl, Daryl stop crying! Calm
down. Don't cry Daryl!

1:29:40.842 --> 1:29:46.155
I just want to talk to the animals...
like we're equal!

1:29:46.381 --> 1:29:54.960
Come on Daryl, we're here! Come on Daryl, get up,
we're here!

1:29:55.189 --> 1:30:02.539
Now you can talk to any animal you want I promise,
just open your eyes!

1:30:02.764 --> 1:30:08.840
Ok, Ok...

1:30:14.776 --> 1:30:16.380
What are you?

1:30:16.611 --> 1:30:20.024
Place that beast on the altar

1:30:20.248 --> 1:30:21.318
What?!

1:30:21.549 --> 1:30:29.900
I said place the creature on the altar!

1:30:30.124 --> 1:30:31.967
Tell me who you are

1:30:32.193 --> 1:30:40.044
We are the remains on an ancient people who
chose the path of the life giver

1:30:40.268 --> 1:30:45.684
instead of the sky monster

1:30:45.907 --> 1:30:48.080
what do you want from me??

1:30:48.309 --> 1:30:53.309
You hold in your hands the only creature
to ever be born from a virgin skin

1:31:02.123 --> 1:31:07.123
In her eyes it's the most
beautiful thing ever created

1:31:12.800 --> 1:31:17.800
That's why I want you to rip its guts out and
dangle them in front of her fucking face!

1:31:26.747 --> 1:31:27.350
NEVER!

1:31:27.582 --> 1:31:36.661
She must be punished,
for what she's done!

1:31:36.891 --> 1:31:46.835
Every second must be lived
in agony, just like us!

1:31:47.068 --> 1:31:52.746
There's no way out! It's best you just do what she
says

1:31:52.974 --> 1:31:58.583
Just be happy you met her before the other one!
Otherwise you might have ended up like me

1:31:58.813 --> 1:32:01.123
I said kill itl!

1:32:01.349 --> 1:32:05.456
Come on Daryl do it! Plunge that blade straight
through its heart!

1:32:05.686 --> 1:32:12.137
It killed your wife, remember? What do
you care, it's not of your seed anyway

1:32:34.048 --> 1:32:41.159
Look at it's eyes! They're so bright...
full of life

1:32:41.389 --> 1:32:44.893
There's a soul in there!

1:32:45.126 --> 1:32:50.906
Shut your fucking mouth and do what I say!!

1:32:51.132 --> 1:32:58.744
Almighty Caine, please open the sky so that I may
receive your light...

1:32:58.973 --> 1:33:02.853
Please open your heart so that I may receive your
love!

1:33:03.077 --> 1:33:04.613
What are you doing??

1:33:04.845 --> 1:33:08.019
Please open your home that
I will never be alone!

1:33:08.249 --> 1:33:09.421
You shut up right now!

1:33:09.650 --> 1:33:11.061
For I love you the almighty Caine!

1:33:11.285 --> 1:33:12.525
Stop saying that!

1:33:12.753 --> 1:33:15.131
And should I ever find myself
lost in the shadow of the beast

1:33:15.356 --> 1:33:20.999
then grant me the ability to see through the
darkness and find your path again!

1:33:21.228 --> 1:33:24.437
I said shut up!
SHUTTHE FUCK UP!

1:33:24.665 --> 1:33:27.737
Almighty Caine, please open the sky
so that I may receive your light...

1:33:27.969 --> 1:33:31.610
Please open your heart so that I
may receive your love!

1:33:31.839 --> 1:33:36.151
STOP SAYING THAT! Please open your home that -I
will never be alone!

1:33:36.377 --> 1:33:38.653
For I love you the almighty
Caine!

1:33:38.879 --> 1:33:42.827
And should I ever find myself lost in the
shadow of the beast I SAID KILL FOR ME!

1:33:43.050 --> 1:33:50.662
Then grant me the ability to see through the
darkness and find your path again!!

1:34:27.361 --> 1:34:28.635
What the fuck are you doing??

1:34:28.863 --> 1:34:31.639
Sir, you told us to go after the boys father!

1:34:31.866 --> 1:34:35.245
I didn't say knock down the fucking
wall while you were doing it!

1:34:35.469 --> 1:34:36.982
Are you out of your fucking mind??

1:34:37.204 --> 1:34:42.051
No sir, sorry sir, you're
right sir, I am scum sir!

1:35:36.497 --> 1:35:42.846
Come on now you stupid bunny fuck! YOU!
FUCKING! BUNNY! RABBIT! FUCK!

1:35:43.070 --> 1:35:46.347
What kind of bunny has blue eyes you fucking
aryan piece of shit!

1:35:46.574 --> 1:35:50.454
FUCK YOU BUNNY! FUCK YOU BUNNY!
BUNNNNNYYYY!

1:35:52.113 --> 1:35:58.758
Give me your hand! COME ON!
COME ON!

1:35:58.986 --> 1:36:02.229
I'll pull you up! Don't be afraid!

1:36:02.456 --> 1:36:05.232
Caine is here!

1:36:07.661 --> 1:36:11.040
I warned you not to go behind that wall!

1:36:43.664 --> 1:36:48.664
Hail Caine! Hail Caine! Hail Caine!
Hail Caine! Hail Caine! Hail Caine!

1:37:40.287 --> 1:37:45.293
It always happens the same way

1:37:46.527 --> 1:37:51.527
I create them, they forget me, rediscover me, and
fall in love

1:37:59.974 --> 1:38:02.454
Then they destroy each other

1:38:03.978 --> 1:38:09.052
That's the problem with pure beauty. No two
people will ever see it the same.

1:38:09.283 --> 1:38:17.134
They will fight over the color of your eyes, ignoring
your words completely.

1:38:31.572 --> 1:38:35.987
Every now and then one of them
will wonder back into the cave

1:38:36.210 --> 1:38:40.158
usually by accident or through
a series of misguided dreams

1:38:40.381 --> 1:38:46.161
As soon as they discover me they try to worm their
way back inside of me

1:38:46.387 --> 1:38:51.928
but I won't let them! and it drives them crazy

1:40:26.120 --> 1:40:32.127
and that's how I learned the truth... He wasn't
waiting for me up there with opened arms

1:40:32.359 --> 1:40:40.141
he didn't want me back. He wanted me to stay
bound

1:40:40.367 --> 1:40:44.144
so I couldn't float towards him ever again

1:40:44.371 --> 1:40:50.049
I will lay here with my eyes closed tightly

1:40:50.277 --> 1:40:52.985
drifting in and out of consciousness

1:40:53.213 --> 1:40:59.164
Where I will dream of laying beside him,
as he whispers forgiveness in my ear

1:40:59.386 --> 1:41:10.386
praying that this world he created for me, will still
be here, when I wake up...
