00:04.750 --> 00:06.920
-Alright, step over here
for me, please.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.250
Turn around for me, sir.
-O-Okay?

00:08.340 --> 00:10.630
-Okay, just relax.
-I'm sorry about that.

00:10.710 --> 00:12.220
My partner's waiting
on some test results.

00:12.300 --> 00:14.050
-"Oh, hey, partner,
can you keep a secret?"

00:14.130 --> 00:15.590
"Oh, yeah, I can keep a secret.
Tell me anything."

00:15.680 --> 00:17.100
-Okay, anyway, uh, sweetie,

00:17.180 --> 00:19.180
where you at about
11:30 p.m. last night?

00:19.260 --> 00:20.600
-Is all this necessary?

00:20.680 --> 00:22.930
-Hey, just answer
the questions, cool guy.

00:23.020 --> 00:24.560
-He ain't that cool.

00:24.640 --> 00:26.520
Look, we got some reports
of some stolen windshield wipers

00:26.600 --> 00:27.940
last night,
and you fit the description.

00:28.020 --> 00:29.320
-Couldn't have been me.

00:29.400 --> 00:30.940
I was at the Promontory
for Third Thursdays.

00:31.030 --> 00:32.610
-See, now, I know you lying,
'cause I been on the list

00:32.690 --> 00:34.110
for Third Thursdays
since the first Third Thursday,

00:34.200 --> 00:35.910
and they ain't did one
in over a year.

00:35.990 --> 00:37.160
-You don't believe me?
-No.

00:37.240 --> 00:39.620
-Okay, bet. Look.
-Whoa, whoa. Easy, easy.

00:39.700 --> 00:42.290
Nice and slow.
Slow motion for me.

00:42.370 --> 00:45.830
-Then what's this?
-Give me that. What is this?

00:45.920 --> 00:47.710
-What is that? What is that?
-What is this?

00:47.790 --> 00:49.500
Okay, you --
Yeah, take a look at that,

00:49.590 --> 00:51.630
Turner,
and tell us what that is.

00:51.710 --> 00:54.300
-Damn, these Negroes did
a Third Thursday without me?

00:54.380 --> 00:56.970
And Crucial Conflict performed?
I thought they broke up.

00:57.050 --> 00:58.850
-They reunited just for this.
It was lit.

00:58.930 --> 01:00.470
I sold a bunch
of windshield wipers.

01:00.560 --> 01:03.480
Damn.
Y'all are good.

01:03.560 --> 01:05.060
-Turn around.
Thank you.

01:05.140 --> 01:07.900
-Damn, man.
-Is it a party?

01:07.980 --> 01:09.810
-Yeah, man, it's the party.

01:09.900 --> 01:11.820
Third Thursdays.

01:11.900 --> 01:14.280
-I have left my handcuffs
in the car.

01:14.360 --> 01:15.610
Do you have handcuffs?

01:15.700 --> 01:16.990
-♪ I was born
on the South Side ♪

01:17.070 --> 01:18.660
♪ I was raised
on the South Side ♪

01:18.740 --> 01:20.280

like we in a line ♪

01:20.370 --> 01:21.990

01:22.080 --> 01:23.500
♪ On the South Side ♪

01:23.580 --> 01:25.250
♪ South Side! ♪

01:25.330 --> 01:26.370
-Whoa, shit.

01:26.460 --> 01:28.500
Who puts a whole pot
in the road?

01:28.580 --> 01:29.500
-Fuck.

01:29.580 --> 01:31.960
My social life is trash.

01:32.050 --> 01:33.840
All I do is sit in here

01:33.920 --> 01:36.670
and ride around in this car
with your sweaty ass.

01:36.760 --> 01:38.130
I lost my drip,
and now it's a drought.

01:38.220 --> 01:39.840
-Hey, it's called
getting older.

01:39.930 --> 01:41.850
You need to embrace it.
-I ain't old.

01:41.930 --> 01:43.350
I got a lot of pussy
left to pop.

01:43.430 --> 01:47.770
-Well, maybe that "P" needs
to do less popping

01:47.850 --> 01:51.400
and less dropping
and perhaps maybe more stopping.

01:51.480 --> 01:52.980
-Mm.
-Oh, my God.

01:53.070 --> 01:54.320
You know what you should do?

01:54.400 --> 01:56.190
There's this thing,
uh, Kitty goes to.

01:56.280 --> 01:57.490
It's a bunch of mature ladies.

01:57.570 --> 01:59.030
They sit around.
-No.

01:59.110 --> 02:01.870
-They -- They drink alcohol.
They paint pictures.

02:01.950 --> 02:03.200
-That's sip 'n' paint.
-No, that's --

02:03.280 --> 02:04.740
-That's definitely
sip 'n' paint.

02:04.830 --> 02:06.790
-No, that's too simple.
Do you get up in the morning

02:06.870 --> 02:08.460
and go, "Ooh, morning. Sun.
I awake."

02:08.540 --> 02:09.750
Come on, get out of here.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.500
Hey, Bixby, call
Itty Bitty Kitty Committee.

02:11.580 --> 02:14.090
It's ironic because my wife
has an ample bosom.

02:14.170 --> 02:17.380
-You have got it, my main man.
-Josh nursed till he was 6.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.930
-Giving Kattandra a holler.
-I got it set to ethnic.

02:20.010 --> 02:22.550
Yeah, I wanted --
-Hey, there, Sandy, my mandy.

02:22.640 --> 02:24.220
-Uh, hey, there,
Kattran-dizzle.

02:24.310 --> 02:27.060
I got you on speaker
with the Turnburn.

02:27.140 --> 02:28.390
What is the name
of that thing you go to?

02:28.480 --> 02:30.230
You guys sit around,
you drink alcohol,

02:30.310 --> 02:33.230
you paint pictures,
you go all the time?

02:33.310 --> 02:36.780
-Oh, the sip 'n' paint.
-Ah. Fuck me.

02:36.860 --> 02:39.150
-Say less.
Switching to vibrate.

02:41.160 --> 02:43.780
-Bixby -- Bixby got a mind
of his own.

02:43.870 --> 02:45.540
Anyway.

02:45.620 --> 02:47.250
-No, we're -- we're
not gonna speak after that.

02:47.330 --> 02:48.790
I just want some silence now.

02:48.870 --> 02:50.460
-No.
I gotta be totally quiet?

02:50.540 --> 02:52.920
-I feel like I had a window
into some freaky shit you into,

02:53.000 --> 02:56.420
and I just --
I don't like that.

02:56.500 --> 02:59.170
-I'm telling you, the San Diego
Chicken has it figured out.

02:59.260 --> 03:01.300
He's not actually owned
by the Padres.

03:01.380 --> 03:04.100
He's an independent contractor,
and what's most important --

03:04.180 --> 03:07.390
he owns all
the intellectual property.

03:07.470 --> 03:08.770
I'm on break.

03:08.850 --> 03:10.310
Licensing, Joe.
That's the dopest hustle of all.

03:10.390 --> 03:11.770
-That job sucks.

03:11.850 --> 03:13.940
The job to have is
an NBA skidmark buffer.

03:14.020 --> 03:15.770
Gotta be fast off those knees,
though.

03:15.860 --> 03:17.400
Here's a few techniques.

03:17.480 --> 03:20.280
Alright, you gotta get down,
and you buff it,

03:20.360 --> 03:22.530
and then you pop up.

03:22.610 --> 03:24.780
Oh, my knee.
Hear that pop?

03:24.870 --> 03:26.740
Oh, that's what happened
at the last tryout.

03:26.830 --> 03:29.620
-Man, get your ass up.
-Okay.

03:29.700 --> 03:31.040
Here's how you do it.

03:31.120 --> 03:35.380
You gotta roll like this,
plant your elbow, turn,

03:35.460 --> 03:39.130
spin around, okay, and...

03:39.210 --> 03:42.300
-You lames is late from break.
-Your dusty-ass momma was late.

03:42.380 --> 03:44.470
-It's not even an insult.
It's just biologically accurate.

03:44.550 --> 03:46.720
She was late,
so she took a pregnancy test.

03:46.800 --> 03:48.390
Twins was a surprise, though.
-Mm.

03:48.470 --> 03:49.810
-Uh, you're late
as well, ma'am.

03:49.890 --> 03:51.310
-Uh, no, Q.

03:51.390 --> 03:53.060
I walked out that door
14 minutes and 30 seconds ago,

03:53.140 --> 03:55.900
so technically, I still got
30 seconds of a break left,

03:55.980 --> 03:58.570
which I will use to stand here
and stare at you angrily.

03:58.650 --> 04:00.570
Jay-Mal, time me.

04:00.650 --> 04:03.070
-I got it.
I'm up.

04:03.150 --> 04:04.530
-Attention, everyone.

04:04.610 --> 04:07.700
New Chicago ordinance --
all breaks are now 10 minutes.

04:07.780 --> 04:10.450
-Nah, nah, nah.
You can't make same-day changes.

04:10.540 --> 04:11.830
Jay-Mal, how much time
I got left?

04:11.910 --> 04:12.910
-Eight seconds.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.790
Seven, six, five....

04:15.880 --> 04:18.000
-Really?
-...four, three,

04:18.090 --> 04:19.250
two, one.

04:19.340 --> 04:21.550
-Now my break is up!

04:21.630 --> 04:23.550
-Hey, um, I heard
you getting fired. Sorry.

04:23.630 --> 04:25.760
-Hey, y'all. Hey, y'all.
Listen up, listen up.

04:25.840 --> 04:27.350
Alright, alright.
Listen.

04:27.430 --> 04:29.220
We need to get
our full break time back.

04:29.310 --> 04:30.680
-Agreed.
-You know what I'm saying?

04:30.770 --> 04:31.810
-Yes.
-I got a text message,

04:31.890 --> 04:34.440
and I can't even respond to it.

04:34.520 --> 04:36.020
"Hey.
Them cheeks clappin'?

04:36.100 --> 04:38.690
You riding this pony
wigless tomorrow."

04:38.770 --> 04:40.940
-Girl, you be nasty.

04:41.030 --> 04:44.530
-So, anyway, it takes me my full
15 to saddle up and dismount.

04:44.610 --> 04:45.740
-Mm-hmm.

04:45.820 --> 04:48.990
-[ Laughs ]
Don't y'all play "Monopoly"?

04:49.080 --> 04:50.540
-No.
-I can tell.

04:50.620 --> 04:52.500
The point of capitalism
is for capital to end up

04:52.580 --> 04:54.250
in as few hands as possible.

04:54.330 --> 04:57.250
Corporations like to give us
these trinkets like breaks

04:57.330 --> 04:58.750
just so that we don't rise up.

04:58.840 --> 05:02.010
Instead of groveling
over five fewer minutes,

05:02.090 --> 05:03.590
the smart man would use
this time

05:03.670 --> 05:06.130
to start his own
mascot business,

05:06.220 --> 05:07.760
and not even necessarily
chicken-based.

05:07.840 --> 05:10.100
-Exactly. We need somebody
with power on our side.

05:10.180 --> 05:12.220
That's what we need.
-That's what I'm talking about.

05:12.310 --> 05:13.560
-Yes.
-You right about that.

05:13.640 --> 05:16.310
-Yeah.
Someone like Halsted Hercules!

05:16.390 --> 05:18.230
Bum-bum-bum!
He got hands.

05:18.310 --> 05:21.190
He's a square by day,
but he squares up by night.

05:21.270 --> 05:22.900
-I got an idea for a mascot.

05:22.980 --> 05:25.110
How about Cold Head?
-No.

05:26.650 --> 05:28.280
-Ahh.

05:28.360 --> 05:30.240
Also, the alderman
is right there.

05:30.320 --> 05:36.410
♪♪

05:36.500 --> 05:37.920
-Roll them big ol' hips.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.840
-Sir, you wanted to talk.
-Oh, yeah, listen, uh,

05:40.920 --> 05:45.800
I know what I want my big,
first 100-days issue to be.

05:45.880 --> 05:47.760
I was just talking
to some constituents --

05:47.840 --> 05:50.010
-No. No. Not the strip club
thing again, please.

05:50.090 --> 05:52.810
-No, not the strip
club thing again.

05:52.890 --> 05:54.890
I swear, I don't know why
you hate that idea so much.

05:54.970 --> 05:56.390
-I'm your chief of staff.

05:56.480 --> 05:58.140
I don't want you to be known
as the guy who lowered

05:58.230 --> 06:00.100
ATM fees at a strip club,

06:00.190 --> 06:02.070
especially because those fees
go to the women.

06:02.150 --> 06:03.940
-Okay, I'd rather give
the money to the women

06:04.030 --> 06:05.440
so I can get an additional song.

06:05.530 --> 06:07.990
I just had this debate
with Diamond very recently.

06:08.070 --> 06:10.620
And more importantly, $6.99?

06:10.700 --> 06:13.280
So, basically, I'm taking out
$27 every time --

06:13.370 --> 06:14.580
No. I'm sorry.

06:14.660 --> 06:16.330
Those machines are
gouging people, Erin.

06:16.410 --> 06:18.870
This is not the conversation
I want to be having right now.

06:18.960 --> 06:21.670
The conversation I want to
be having is what is my issue?

06:21.750 --> 06:23.290
And I think I know what it is.

06:23.380 --> 06:26.630
You ready?

06:26.710 --> 06:28.630
Revoking the new ordinance
on break time.

06:28.720 --> 06:30.970
-No. Absolutely not.
That thing is too big.

06:31.050 --> 06:33.350
I've looked at the numbers,
and it looks like

06:33.430 --> 06:35.600
there's four co-sponsors,

06:35.680 --> 06:40.520
overwhelming support from
City Council, and backing --

06:40.600 --> 06:43.940
You already wrote
a press release, didn't you?

06:44.020 --> 06:46.400
-I'm on it.

06:46.480 --> 06:48.530
I wrote it an hour ago.
-Alright, let's see.

06:48.610 --> 06:52.320
Okay, "O-Obama gave you
healthcare.

06:52.410 --> 06:53.660
Allen Gayle's gonna give you

06:53.740 --> 06:57.540
a break the titty time tax
is too much"?

06:57.620 --> 06:58.960
-Delete that last part.
It's a typo.

06:59.040 --> 07:00.790
But don't you see?

07:00.870 --> 07:02.500
If I win, people will be like,

07:02.580 --> 07:04.250
"That fool took
on all of Chicago!

07:04.340 --> 07:06.500
Shit! Shee-it!"

07:06.590 --> 07:08.170
That's how they talk.
I've been listening.

07:08.260 --> 07:10.340
But here's the deal --
I'll take on Brookfield,

07:10.420 --> 07:12.840
I'll take on Oak Brook,
I'll take on Willow Brook,

07:12.930 --> 07:15.180
I'll take on Bolingbrook.
All the brooks, and win.

07:15.260 --> 07:17.390
And honestly, if I lose,
they won't be surprised.

07:17.470 --> 07:18.600
They'll be like, "You know what?

07:18.680 --> 07:20.180
That fool took
on all of Chicago.

07:20.270 --> 07:21.690
He took on all the brooks."

07:21.770 --> 07:23.900
-The brooks are suburbs.
-Eh, keep talking like that,

07:23.980 --> 07:25.230
you're gonna have beef
with the brooks.

07:25.310 --> 07:28.030
-This is so foolish.

07:28.110 --> 07:31.320
Wait, but you'll be
the people's fool.

07:31.400 --> 07:34.530
I can work with that.
-That's the calling card.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.490
By the way, I'm also gonna need
some calling cards.

07:36.580 --> 07:39.500
Get Metro PCS on the phone.
-I'll just go there.

07:39.580 --> 07:41.370
They're open.
-Oh, you can take the alley.

07:41.460 --> 07:43.620
No, it's safe now.
The guy with the Slinky is gone.

07:43.710 --> 07:45.040
-Okay.

07:45.130 --> 07:47.750
-Okay, ladies, ladies, ladies.
Alright?

07:47.840 --> 07:50.760
We don't have to be constrained
by reality here, alright?

07:50.840 --> 07:52.970
Just -- Just paint
with your heart.

07:53.050 --> 07:54.220
What do you feel?

07:54.300 --> 07:56.140
What -- What vibe
is he giving you, okay?

07:56.220 --> 07:57.850
His eyes are giving me so much.

07:57.930 --> 08:01.020
Do you see your father?
Do -- Do you see pain?

08:01.100 --> 08:04.020
Do you see a lover?
Do you see God?

08:04.100 --> 08:06.730
A liar? Deceit?

08:06.810 --> 08:08.860

-The answer's no.

26:15.610 --> 26:16.990
-What about the thing
I asked you for?

I annoy you.

Otherwise, you wouldn't
even have me here.

Sooner or later, they're gonna
run out of pizza,

they're gonna want answers.

Or maybe, just maybe,
they'll turn their eyes
