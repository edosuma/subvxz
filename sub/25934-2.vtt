Cal, as you can see, it's chaos here.

00:09.720 --> 00:11.720
Guys. Guys.

00:11.720 --> 00:14.319
Hey. What are you doing
looking at my boys naked?

00:14.319 --> 00:16.720
I really love your... your
little boys with their...

00:16.720 --> 00:18.800
with their little bouncy balls.

00:18.800 --> 00:21.800
(CHUCKLES) He's gonna have to quit.

00:21.800 --> 00:25.239
Um, there might be a story
coming out later on this afternoon

00:25.239 --> 00:27.079
about me being a paedophile.

00:27.079 --> 00:28.920
Can you get Frank onto that ASAP?

00:28.920 --> 00:30.600
I married a worm.

00:30.600 --> 00:33.239
Well, no, love, I don't really think
you're being fair there.

00:33.239 --> 00:35.400
Just fuck off back to Play School.

00:35.400 --> 00:36.400
(BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!)

00:36.400 --> 00:40.239
This summit is about securing safety
for Australia, the region,

00:40.239 --> 00:41.519
and the planet.

LINUS: The President is adamant
that every part of this treaty

00:44.360 --> 00:47.879
represent a stronger,
even more aggressive posture.

00:47.879 --> 00:50.800
WOMAN: Now, I dare say it's gonna be
a little squeezy in here.

00:50.800 --> 00:54.000
This place hasn't functioned
as a Parliament for 35 years.

00:54.639 --> 00:57.639
The President wants a war,
preferably global.

00:57.639 --> 00:58.800
You know that.

00:58.800 --> 01:01.680
Tonight, we're going to party
like it's 1999.

01:01.680 --> 01:03.560
So can you just do me a favour?

01:03.560 --> 01:06.119
Make some calls and organise
something, you know?

01:10.239 --> 01:13.479
What you're doing there, that
doesn't look like such a good idea.

Oh.

03:14.920 --> 03:17.079
- Senator.
- Mate...

03:17.079 --> 03:18.680
I, I've got a body here.

03:18.680 --> 03:21.239
A body? Of a female nature?

03:21.239 --> 03:22.759
Yes, yes.

03:22.759 --> 03:25.360
And the US Defense Secretary
seems to have shot through

03:25.360 --> 03:28.079
and he's not... he's not all that well,

03:28.079 --> 03:30.039
and he may or may not
have the nuclear codes.

03:30.039 --> 03:32.439
Is she with or without breath?

03:32.439 --> 03:34.400
She's breathing but... but just.

03:34.400 --> 03:37.119
She needs to go to hospital.
I think she's ODed.

03:37.119 --> 03:39.360
Relax. I'll be there in 10 minutes.

03:39.360 --> 03:40.560
Make it five.

03:41.879 --> 03:43.839
Can you please open the door?

03:45.000 --> 03:47.720
Jet lag. Shocking flight from Reykjavik.

03:48.280 --> 03:49.879
Ooh, God.

03:52.319 --> 03:54.600
- So, which hospital?
- No, no.

03:54.600 --> 03:56.200
No hospital. The usual place.

03:56.200 --> 03:58.280
There's a usual place?

04:13.039 --> 04:15.920
Mate, where on God's green earth are we?

04:15.920 --> 04:19.079

04:40.439 --> 04:41.439
Look away.

04:47.280 --> 04:49.560
- What is it?
- Oh, mate, who knows?

04:49.560 --> 04:50.920
I mean... You know, there was...

04:50.920 --> 04:54.079
There was coke there,
there were a rainbow of pills.

04:54.079 --> 04:55.239
It could be any bloody thing.

do not bring this trash, this filth,

- Some gentlemen are here.
- Oh, good.

05:22.039 --> 05:24.360
Are you happy now? Are you proud man?

05:24.360 --> 05:26.079
My mother, she come to witness this.

- You clean up this mess.

05:31.319 --> 05:33.239
Thank God.

05:33.239 --> 05:34.239
I need to know

05:34.239 --> 05:37.039
where the United States
Secretary of Defense currently is.

05:37.039 --> 05:39.239
How would I know, mate? That's your job.

05:39.239 --> 05:41.959
Christ. It's like Berlin all over again.

05:43.720 --> 05:47.079
Oh, Jesus.
Hasn't the poor girl had enough?

Ow. Fuck.

06:16.839 --> 06:19.879
- Senator Greene? Coming to there?
- Uh...

06:19.879 --> 06:21.439
Welcome.

06:23.879 --> 06:25.680
Can one of the boys get you a drink?

06:25.680 --> 06:27.839
We've got guava juice,
freshly squeezed orange.

06:27.839 --> 06:29.720
- Oh, fuck.
- Or perhaps you prefer coffee.

06:29.720 --> 06:31.239
MAN: (IN THE DISTANCE) Relax, man.

06:31.239 --> 06:33.119
Big night, huh?

06:33.119 --> 06:34.400
We're all feeling it a little.

06:35.479 --> 06:37.039
Well, there you go.

06:37.039 --> 06:39.239
Evelyn's brought you a coffee.

06:39.239 --> 06:41.079
Evelyn?

06:41.079 --> 06:44.680
My name's Carol. We weren't
formally introduced last night.

06:44.680 --> 06:46.920
Oh, you're Carol, really?

06:46.920 --> 06:49.400
Carol can be
either a male or a female name.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.239
Yeah, not really, mate.

06:51.239 --> 06:52.959
It's a kind of an American male name.

06:52.959 --> 06:55.639
Like Evelyn or Marion.

06:55.639 --> 06:57.479
Well, Marion's definitely a girl's name.

06:57.479 --> 07:01.159
- It can be either.
- John Wayne's real name was Marion.

07:01.159 --> 07:03.680
What? John Wayne's real name
was Marion Wayne.

07:03.680 --> 07:06.200
Let's not get bogged down in this.

07:06.200 --> 07:07.360
As a matter of urgency,

07:07.360 --> 07:09.479
we need to know the whereabouts
of Linus Potemkin.

07:09.479 --> 07:12.800
And even you must know there's
a rather important meeting today?

07:12.800 --> 07:14.759
Yes. Yes, um...

07:14.759 --> 07:17.000
Yeah, I mean I was
talking to your mate...

07:17.000 --> 07:18.759
- Beverley.
- Oh, Beverley.

07:18.759 --> 07:21.239
Again, more common in the States.

07:21.239 --> 07:22.680
Senator Greene,

07:23.039 --> 07:24.600
where is the Secretary?

07:24.600 --> 07:25.639
I don't know, mate.

07:25.639 --> 07:27.839
I mean, we were all there,
you'd know as well as I would.

07:27.839 --> 07:30.600
I mean, why don't you just...
just track his phone or something?

07:30.600 --> 07:32.560
We've just spent about $50 million

07:32.560 --> 07:34.680
making sure no-one on the planet
can track that phone.

07:35.839 --> 07:38.319
Francis, can you kill the C&W?

07:38.319 --> 07:40.039
So, his name's Francis?

07:40.039 --> 07:41.400
As was Sinatra's.

07:41.400 --> 07:44.159
Let's not make light of this very
grave situation, Senator Greene.

07:44.159 --> 07:45.759
Don't start on me, mate.

07:45.759 --> 07:48.239
Your crack team
of male impersonators here

07:48.239 --> 07:50.039
was supposed to be
protecting him, alright?

07:50.039 --> 07:52.039
No-one is saying there haven't been
security failures

07:52.039 --> 07:53.800
- on both our ends.
- Where's the door?

07:53.800 --> 07:56.600
I mean, how did I physically
get into this shithole?

07:56.600 --> 07:58.360
And what happened to that girl
last night?

07:58.360 --> 08:01.079
Senator Greene, these are fragile
times we find ourselves in.

08:01.079 --> 08:05.000
The only fragility I'm sensing, Helen,

08:05.000 --> 08:09.479
is that I'm a Senator in the
Australian Federal Parliament, OK,

08:09.479 --> 08:13.000
and I'm being held here
without any explanation.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.560
Now, there are people out there
who love me,

08:15.560 --> 08:17.319
who will be worried sick by now.

08:17.319 --> 08:20.239
Where the fuck
is my Secretary of Defense?

08:20.239 --> 08:22.319
- You all have a lot to answer for.
- How did he, where did he come...

08:22.319 --> 08:25.000
- Where's the door?
- We have an Athens situation, Tiger.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.639
Goddammit. Sit.

08:32.800 --> 08:34.839
- Where is he?
- I don't know, mate.

08:34.839 --> 08:36.560
I don't... How can I...

08:36.560 --> 08:38.600
He might be a tad out of control.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.560
He told me he had the nuclear codes,

08:40.560 --> 08:42.600
and then he said
that that was just a joke.

08:42.600 --> 08:46.400
And then he took a couple of happy
snaps of his stinkers bridge.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.280
I mean, your boy might not be well.

08:48.280 --> 08:52.280
Senator Greene, you're a
forward-thinking kind of guy, right?

08:52.280 --> 08:55.079
We have an issue here
that we need to address forwardly.

08:55.079 --> 08:58.239
Now, last night,
you and our Secretary of Defense

08:58.239 --> 09:00.920
made a connection with
drug dealers and prostitutes.

09:00.920 --> 09:03.239
If any of that were to get
out, it would seriously...

09:03.239 --> 09:05.000
As did Narelle here.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.400
- I mean...
- Shut up.

09:06.400 --> 09:10.839
Secretary Potemkin is the key player
in treaty negotiations

09:10.839 --> 09:14.119
with various parties
over hotly contested territories,

09:14.119 --> 09:18.079
which if not resolved would lead us
all into dire consequences.

09:18.079 --> 09:20.039
Jesus H Christ.

09:20.039 --> 09:22.239
And we're sure he's headed
to the Italian Ambassador?

09:22.239 --> 09:24.039
Yes. And Barlow, Judders and Mannheim.

09:24.560 --> 09:26.039
He copied them in accidentally.

09:26.039 --> 09:27.360
Sir, we meant to send the pictures to...

09:27.360 --> 09:28.879
What pictures?

09:28.879 --> 09:31.839
Our Athens situation's
turned into Belgrade.

09:31.839 --> 09:33.439
Oh, fuck.

09:33.920 --> 09:37.079
Barlow, Judders and Mannheim have
been sexted photos of his dick.

09:37.079 --> 09:38.800
(LAUGHS)

09:38.800 --> 09:41.079
This could bring down
the whole administration.

09:41.079 --> 09:42.200
Ah, well, look,

09:42.200 --> 09:45.200
I'm sure your women's collective here
can sort that one out.

09:45.200 --> 09:48.200
Sadly, when great men
take photos of the genitalia,

09:48.200 --> 09:49.519
it always gets out.

09:50.560 --> 09:53.639
So for us, this really becomes
a question of attribution.

09:53.639 --> 09:55.879
- What do you mean attribu...
- Hey, what's with the...?

09:55.879 --> 09:58.759
- Thank you for your cooperation.
- What cooperation?

10:09.920 --> 10:13.439
Boys. Come on.

10:13.439 --> 10:15.400
Oh, God.

10:15.400 --> 10:16.720
Oh.

10:16.720 --> 10:20.159
MAN: So these transvestite,
music-loving CIA operatives...

10:20.159 --> 10:21.680
They weren't transvestites.

10:21.680 --> 10:23.639
And they may not have been CIA.

10:24.560 --> 10:27.959
Sure. They drugged you,
left you in a shopping mall...

10:27.959 --> 10:29.959
Yes, yes. Yes.

10:29.959 --> 10:33.639
We might have even believed you
if it wasn't for this item.

10:40.439 --> 10:41.800
Well, that's not me.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.439
Oh, you're saying that's not your head.

10:43.439 --> 10:45.360
That's not my penis.

10:45.360 --> 10:46.360
(CLEARS THROAT)

10:46.360 --> 10:49.959
I, I mean they've photoshopped
my face. You can see that.

10:49.959 --> 10:52.959
I didn't realise the man
was so ill-equipped for the job.

10:52.959 --> 10:55.600
I mean, why would you
take a photo of that?

10:55.600 --> 10:57.400
- We were wondering the same thing.
- Yeah.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.720
It's not me. OK? That is not...

11:01.159 --> 11:04.119
Look, it's very important,
no, it's vital,

11:04.119 --> 11:07.159
that this photo
never see the light of day.

11:07.159 --> 11:08.920
It's fabricated, alright?

11:08.920 --> 11:11.000
You've got to give me time
to sort this shit out.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
I'm a senator, something like this
could destroy me.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.119
Wonderful news.

11:16.119 --> 11:18.200
My brother's just been arrested again.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.200
They're not charging him

11:19.200 --> 11:21.479
but the idiot sexted
some diplomats in America

11:21.479 --> 11:23.479
using the Secretary of Defense's phone.

11:23.479 --> 11:24.920
His photo's all over the web.

11:26.720 --> 11:30.439
No, no, no. What you've got
in your hand is a small plate.

11:30.439 --> 11:32.039
It belongs
with all the other small plates.

11:32.039 --> 11:33.639
How many times, Cal?

11:33.639 --> 11:36.360
Wouldn't the time spent sorting them now

11:36.360 --> 11:39.920
be the same as the time spent
sorting them when they're dry?

11:40.360 --> 11:44.560
I am trying so effing hard
to make this relationship work.

11:44.560 --> 11:45.959
Yes.

11:45.959 --> 11:48.280
We're meant to be living in your
fabulous harbour view apartment

11:48.280 --> 11:50.519
on your multimillion-dollar salary.

11:50.519 --> 11:52.119
But, no, instead, you decide

11:52.119 --> 11:53.759
to lodge another appeal
against your brother

11:53.759 --> 11:55.079
and we're living in this dump.

11:55.079 --> 11:56.360
This is far from a dump, Pumpkin.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.680
And my father promised me that painting.

11:59.680 --> 12:03.119
It's a piece of shit painting
with three cows eating grass.

12:03.119 --> 12:04.959
And you've spent 10 million bucks
in legals

12:04.959 --> 12:07.519
on something
you could find in a garage sale.

12:11.639 --> 12:14.519
Tomorrow, you bury my brother.

12:15.239 --> 12:19.280
You go on air
and you publicly disembowel him.

12:19.280 --> 12:24.360
You remove every vital organ and you
squeeze them until they squelch.

12:26.639 --> 12:27.639
Yes, my sweet.

12:29.879 --> 12:30.879
What are you doing?

12:34.920 --> 12:38.319
Do we know yet the type of gas
that was used by the terrorists?

12:38.319 --> 12:43.800
No, the exact chemical breakdown of
the noxious gas is still unknown,

12:43.800 --> 12:47.560
our focus at present
is to contain whatever evil

12:47.560 --> 12:49.879
is locked inside New Parliament House

12:49.879 --> 12:52.400
and stop it leaking into the water table.

12:52.400 --> 12:57.280
I will now invite the Minister for
Homeland Security, Gareth Morrow,

12:57.280 --> 13:00.959
to outline our new,
increased security arrangements.

13:00.959 --> 13:02.720
- Minister?
- Thank you, Prime Minister.

13:02.720 --> 13:05.200
- And may I...
- MAN: Excuse me. Excuse me.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.479
Kids coming through. Excuse me. Sorry.

13:07.479 --> 13:09.920
Just a school group
of young aspiring Australians

13:09.920 --> 13:12.400
yearning to learn how democracy works.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.479
It's all paid for months in advance.

13:14.479 --> 13:15.519
Right, kids.

13:15.519 --> 13:17.839
This is the Prime Minister and
the Minister for Homeland Security,

13:17.839 --> 13:19.280
obviously talking about keeping us safe.

13:22.119 --> 13:27.839
Now, today the government announces
a higher terrorist warning level.

13:27.839 --> 13:33.360
At this point in time, the levels
range from unlikely to possible,

13:33.360 --> 13:35.159
to probable to certain,

13:35.159 --> 13:36.959
and as from today,

13:37.400 --> 13:40.600
this new category
being extremely certain.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.319
Boys.

13:45.639 --> 13:47.959
- You found the idiot yet?
- No, we have not.

13:47.959 --> 13:50.519
Jesus. Johnny's delegation's
already left the airport.

13:50.519 --> 13:52.119
(CHUCKLES)

13:52.119 --> 13:54.039
This is going to be just like Montreal.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.479
Search every gay brothel and bar.

13:59.479 --> 14:01.839
He's clearly in an Auckland mood.

14:03.039 --> 14:04.879
It may even be Budapest.

14:06.519 --> 14:08.200
He's a Green Beret after all.

14:08.200 --> 14:10.639
Sorry, of course, Mr President.

14:10.639 --> 14:13.039
It's just, at this point in time,

14:13.039 --> 14:16.360
we currently don't know
his precise location,

14:16.360 --> 14:20.360
but we are still in furious
negotiations over the treaty,

14:20.360 --> 14:22.920
the treaty we are signing with you.

14:22.920 --> 14:25.360
(MAN SHOUTS ON OTHER END OF PHONE)

14:25.360 --> 14:27.239
Sure, yeah.

14:27.360 --> 14:30.000
We will find him, rest assured.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.159
(CONTINUES SHOUTING)

14:35.200 --> 14:38.839
Somebody find that drug-sodden arsehole

14:38.839 --> 14:41.319
before he sinks the entire alliance!

14:45.639 --> 14:47.560
(MAN CONTINUES SHOUTING)

14:47.560 --> 14:50.800
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr President,
I thought you'd hung up.

15:19.360 --> 15:21.720
It's bullshit. It's all bullshit.

15:21.720 --> 15:23.600
Yeah. Drugs, hookers a wild party.

15:23.600 --> 15:25.920
No, no, not that bit. The sexting.
Doesn't sound like you at all.

15:25.920 --> 15:30.079
That is not my Arthur Phillips
on display there.

15:30.079 --> 15:34.319
Privately, in certain circles,

15:34.319 --> 15:37.000
I used to be known as 'The Plough'.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.079
- Oh, yuck! Cleaver.
- Fact.

15:39.079 --> 15:40.720
I'm just telling you.

15:40.720 --> 15:43.560
That's... I, I was kidnapped, alright,

15:43.560 --> 15:45.720
by Americans who wanted to...

15:45.720 --> 15:49.239
They were a bunch of like,
Beverley, Joyce, Mary, Julia...

15:49.239 --> 15:51.600
- Oh, an Amazon tribe.
- No. Guys, guys!

15:51.600 --> 15:54.200
- They're not guys' names.
- Well, that's America for you.

15:54.200 --> 15:56.360
That's the way...
They're called ladies, they're,

15:56.360 --> 15:59.479
John Wayne was born a lady, lady.

15:59.479 --> 16:02.600
They, they, fucking kidnapped me,
they drugged me.

16:02.600 --> 16:03.879
Oh, that'd be hard.

16:03.879 --> 16:06.639
I, I, count on this job, Cleaver,

16:06.639 --> 16:08.879
I count on this income, so...

16:08.879 --> 16:11.280
Do not screw this for me, OK?

16:12.280 --> 16:14.159
You go to Parliament, you apologise,

16:14.159 --> 16:17.639
and then you say nothing
for the rest of your unnatural life.

16:17.639 --> 16:19.560
That is not my Able Seaman.

16:19.560 --> 16:23.360
Did the Americans
go anywhere near your phone?

16:23.879 --> 16:25.280
Why?

16:25.280 --> 16:29.039
Maybe don't say too much
in your phone conversations.

16:32.039 --> 16:33.439
(SOFTLY) You think they're listening?

16:33.439 --> 16:36.119
Am I in danger?

16:37.720 --> 16:39.319
Define "danger".

16:49.119 --> 16:50.519
(PHONE RINGS)

16:51.360 --> 16:53.839
- Cleaver's on, Frank.
- Cleave, mate.

16:53.839 --> 16:56.759
There's a mob of press waiting
to tear you apart out there.

16:56.759 --> 16:59.319
I think you should let me
do the talking, boss.

16:59.319 --> 17:01.079
Yes, yes, you do the talking.

17:01.079 --> 17:03.519
No, OK, Frank, what, what...
Just... What...

17:03.519 --> 17:04.800
Run it by us, first, please.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.920
I think we should just
play a straight bat here.

17:06.920 --> 17:08.959
Yeah, yeah, straight bat, good. Good.

17:08.959 --> 17:11.839
Well, what would a straight bat
say to the press?

17:11.839 --> 17:15.079
That Senator Greene was pissed
and he taken a few happy pills,

17:15.079 --> 17:16.319
which he now regrets.

17:16.319 --> 17:18.879
He's clearly embarrassed
by how little the thing is

17:18.879 --> 17:21.400
which caused the drinking and drug
taking in the first place.

17:21.400 --> 17:25.039
And, ah, he hopes the public
will understand and forgive him.

17:25.039 --> 17:28.239
- No, mate, that's a bad idea.
- Are you kidding me, Frank?

17:28.239 --> 17:30.119
Look, Cleave, there's a book in this.

17:30.119 --> 17:33.239
A lot of blokes out there, a bit
light on the God box themselves

17:33.239 --> 17:35.400
want to know there's
a kindred spirit in Parliament

17:35.400 --> 17:36.479
to represent them.

17:36.479 --> 17:38.239
Some days are better than others.

17:38.239 --> 17:40.039
Go... now!

17:40.039 --> 17:41.360
Will do.

17:45.079 --> 17:46.560
You, you still pleased

17:46.560 --> 17:49.119
that you made a man who played
for Balmain 40 years ago

17:49.119 --> 17:51.800
and whose brother you owe money to
your press secretary?

17:51.800 --> 17:54.759
- Oh, look at this goat fuck.
- Oh, shit.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
I mean, fuck.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.239
OK. Flank me. Flank me.

18:06.239 --> 18:08.079
- There's only one of me, Cleaver.
- Walk in front.

18:08.079 --> 18:09.519
How can I flank you?

18:09.519 --> 18:11.800
So, are you going to resign,
Senator Greene?

18:11.800 --> 18:14.280
Have your actions damaged
the Australia-US Alliance?

18:14.280 --> 18:15.280
Senator. Senator!

18:15.280 --> 18:18.200
Look, guys, I would like
to make a statement, alright?

18:18.200 --> 18:22.200
I, I... look forward very
much to clearing my name

18:22.200 --> 18:24.200
when all the facts emerge.

18:24.200 --> 18:27.360
Your photo is everywhere, bit late
to clear your name, isn't it?

18:27.360 --> 18:28.439
Senator!

18:28.439 --> 18:32.600
I would ask the press
to please respect my privacy

18:32.600 --> 18:34.159
at this difficult time.

18:34.159 --> 18:36.360
Why, it's not as if
someone close to you died.

18:36.360 --> 18:39.639
You stole
the US Defense Secretary's phone,

18:39.639 --> 18:41.959
you took a snap of your penis,

18:41.959 --> 18:45.360
and you sexted it to
the Italian Ambassador and others.

18:45.360 --> 18:47.079
- Who told you that?
- The Americans.

18:48.159 --> 18:50.360
It's not mine. It's not mine.

18:51.400 --> 18:54.400
- I was drugged.
- OK.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.720
- Senator.
- So you admit to taking drugs?

18:59.800 --> 19:01.159
- Cleaver!
- Fuck.

19:01.159 --> 19:04.400
You are a real...

19:05.159 --> 19:07.959
You know, you should be ashamed
of yourself.

19:07.959 --> 19:10.000
Shame, shame on you.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.079
(PHONE RINGS)

19:12.079 --> 19:13.680
It's the Secret Service.

19:17.239 --> 19:18.959
Can you just, can't...?

19:20.159 --> 19:21.879
Gimme your phone,
I'm gonna twitter a denial.

19:21.879 --> 19:24.560
No, you don't. and it's "tweet". "Tweet".

19:24.560 --> 19:26.839
- I have to clear my name.
- Well, you can't.

19:26.839 --> 19:28.879
And for God's sake, you do not
tell Frank about social media.

19:28.879 --> 19:32.200
I will keep doing your tweeting
till you find a replacement.

19:32.200 --> 19:35.079
I do my own tweeting.
Not anymore you don't.

19:35.079 --> 19:37.000
Well, what've you got me saying.

19:37.759 --> 19:41.280
Ah, "Thursday walked in Namadgi
National Park to clear my head."

19:41.280 --> 19:42.360
Never been near the place.

19:42.360 --> 19:43.439
You've never cleared your head either.

19:43.439 --> 19:45.119
"Saturday, caught up with old friends.

19:45.119 --> 19:46.200
"How good it is to have old friends."

19:46.200 --> 19:47.639
You make me sound like
a fucking desk calendar.

19:47.639 --> 19:48.879
Yes. Much better to tweet,

19:48.879 --> 19:51.920
"That is another man's penis
with my head on it."

19:51.920 --> 19:53.920
(PHONE RINGS)

19:53.920 --> 19:55.200
Huh?

20:00.759 --> 20:02.720
Is the chipolata kid in his office?

20:03.000 --> 20:04.560
Yes, he is.

20:07.839 --> 20:09.639
You having a rough time of it, Cleaver?

20:09.639 --> 20:11.439
I've had better weeks, mate.

20:11.839 --> 20:14.560
I don't know how to stop this.
No, you can't.

20:14.560 --> 20:15.959
You know, in the good old days,

20:15.959 --> 20:18.159
when someone did a rice paper
drawing of their cods

20:18.159 --> 20:20.759
and sent it out via carrier pigeon,
well, it wasn't a problem.

20:20.759 --> 20:24.680
But today, now, it's all out there
in a nanosecond.

20:24.680 --> 20:26.360
Fortunately for you...

20:28.280 --> 20:32.560
Well, the headlines are mainly about
the terrorist attack.

20:39.239 --> 20:40.519
(SOFTLY) Not my penis.

20:41.519 --> 20:43.000
My head.

20:43.519 --> 20:45.239
Not my penis.

20:45.239 --> 20:46.560
I don't care.

20:46.560 --> 20:48.239
It's a private matter.

20:48.239 --> 20:51.200
- I was kidnapped. I was drugged.
- Really?

20:51.439 --> 20:53.079
Are you sure? Who by?

20:53.079 --> 20:54.959
America.

20:54.959 --> 20:58.400
Not all of it. Some ladies' name guys.

20:58.400 --> 21:00.720
Gene, Renee, Carol.

21:00.720 --> 21:02.439
Wow.

21:02.439 --> 21:04.079
- Dangerous.
- Mmm.

21:04.079 --> 21:06.000
- Am I safe?
- Safe-ish.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.560
Three diplomats just died
in a car accident in DC.

21:09.560 --> 21:10.560
What? Who?

21:10.560 --> 21:11.759
Oh...

21:13.119 --> 21:15.400
Barrow, Judders, Mannheim.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.439
- Never heard of them myself.
- Oh, mate.

21:18.600 --> 21:19.959
He sent them the photo.

21:20.400 --> 21:22.039
Do you know where Potemkin is?

21:23.720 --> 21:26.560
The treaty meeting
was meant to start an hour ago.

21:27.239 --> 21:30.680
I know you think I'm the enemy
in this place, but I'm not.

21:32.079 --> 21:33.560
You and I have much in common.

21:33.560 --> 21:36.879
What, mate, apart from
both hating your brother?

21:37.959 --> 21:39.800
- Cal's my half-brother.
- Oh...

21:39.800 --> 21:41.200
And, mate,

21:41.200 --> 21:44.479
I hate people probably in my own
party more than I hate you.

21:44.479 --> 21:45.759
OK.

21:45.759 --> 21:47.680
You did threaten to oppose me

21:47.680 --> 21:49.720
on the amendments
to the Trade Practices Act.

21:49.720 --> 21:53.560
Mate, you're letting big supermarket
monopolies wipe out farmers.

21:53.560 --> 21:54.879
It's a no-brainer.

21:54.879 --> 21:58.159
But just because you oppose it
doesn't mean that I hate you, mate.

21:58.800 --> 22:02.000
In fact, if anything, well,
I respect you for your stance.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.479
Mate, you're not going to sway me.

22:03.479 --> 22:05.800
Cleaver, I wouldn't try.

22:07.039 --> 22:09.680
I know you to be a man of principle.

22:10.959 --> 22:14.920
But, mate, I think you need to
disappear out of harm's way.

22:15.479 --> 22:18.720
You need to maintain a very low profile.

22:18.720 --> 22:24.600
Look, how about tomorrow I get you
on to some out-of-the-way committee,

22:24.600 --> 22:27.039
you know, while Parliament's in recess.

22:27.039 --> 22:31.360
How about the Agricultural Tariff
and Subsidy Abrogation Committee?

22:31.360 --> 22:32.639
No.

22:33.159 --> 22:35.200
I mean, for starters, there were
three words in that sentence

22:35.200 --> 22:36.519
I didn't understand.

22:36.519 --> 22:39.039
Well, yeah, you probably wouldn't
want to be on it anyway.

22:39.039 --> 22:40.159
Potter's the vice-chair.

22:40.159 --> 22:42.000
Oh, Jesus, mate.

22:42.000 --> 22:46.600
OK. What about Primary Produce
Subcommittee, eh?

22:46.600 --> 22:50.159
Now, it's very low-profile,
and there's lots of travel.

22:50.159 --> 22:52.519
You'd be out of the public eye.

22:52.519 --> 22:54.560
Wouldn't be a camera in sight, my son.

22:56.360 --> 22:58.920
- Lots of travel?
- Heaps of travel.

23:05.119 --> 23:10.039
For the perfect milker,
you need part-Jersey,

23:10.039 --> 23:13.039
part-Holstein,

23:13.039 --> 23:14.639
and, uh...

23:16.200 --> 23:17.560
Fascinating stuff.

23:17.560 --> 23:19.360
You like to guess the other part?

23:19.360 --> 23:20.680
Oh, well, you know, I...

23:20.680 --> 23:21.879
Three parts, gosh.

23:21.879 --> 23:23.879
I mean, I'd really be guessing.

23:23.879 --> 23:25.479
Limousin.

23:25.479 --> 23:27.680
And my guess would have been right.

23:27.680 --> 23:30.680
- And you know why we...
- Abel, could I just hold...

23:30.680 --> 23:32.639
You keep entertaining the troops,

23:32.639 --> 23:34.879
I just need to have a quick word
with my chief of staff.

23:34.879 --> 23:35.879
Thank you, Abel.

23:38.119 --> 23:41.839
What the never-ending fuck
are we doing here?

23:41.839 --> 23:45.400
Oh, you're asking me?
You chose the milk subcommittee.

23:45.400 --> 23:48.800
OK, yes, because Joe McGregor
told me that it involved travel.

23:48.800 --> 23:52.720
I didn't think it'd be a light plane
out to shit sticks looking at cows.

23:52.720 --> 23:54.879
Where did you think milk came from,
Cleaver?

23:54.879 --> 23:56.000
The supermarket.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.360
Why do I listen to you? You right?

23:58.360 --> 23:59.519
You don't.

24:00.680 --> 24:04.959
If the Government passes this new
Consumer Trade Practices bullshit,

24:04.959 --> 24:08.280
supermarkets will have more power
than ever over farmers.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.360
Senator Greene strongly opposes it,

24:10.360 --> 24:13.280
and his vote will guarantee
it doesn't get through.

24:15.039 --> 24:17.280
Does that thing look at everybody
like that?

24:21.959 --> 24:24.759
Oh, it'll be great to be in Sydney
for a couple of days.

24:24.759 --> 24:26.000
- What?
- Huh?

24:26.000 --> 24:27.839
Great to be in Sydney
for a couple of days.

24:27.839 --> 24:30.159
- Yeah.
- I can crash at yours, can't I?

24:30.159 --> 24:31.479
- No, you can't. No.
- No?

24:31.479 --> 24:33.159
Really, Cleaver.

24:33.159 --> 24:34.920
You said that last time
was the last time,

24:34.920 --> 24:38.519
and you said that you'd either
get Wendy to let you stay,

24:38.519 --> 24:40.680
or that you'd get a place of your own.

24:41.200 --> 24:43.159
What, you believed me on either count?

24:43.159 --> 24:45.560
Jesus, it's like we've never met.

24:45.560 --> 24:46.879
- What's up?
- Nothing.

24:46.879 --> 24:48.720
- Huh?
- Nothing is up.

24:48.720 --> 24:51.959
I just get a bit, I get a bit
choked up on planes, is all.

24:51.959 --> 24:53.759
- Do you?
- What?

24:53.759 --> 24:55.759
Do you cry sometimes?

24:55.759 --> 24:56.759
- On planes?
- Yes.

24:56.759 --> 24:58.800
- No. Never.
- Right.

24:59.920 --> 25:01.200
I don't know why I...

25:01.200 --> 25:03.479
- What?
- I said I don't know why I do.

25:03.479 --> 25:05.400
Maybe it's 'cause we're
so high up, and...

25:06.839 --> 25:08.879
and our problems are so far below, and...

25:10.479 --> 25:13.039
I don't know, from up here,
you just... You just...

25:13.639 --> 25:16.479
You just see how small and
irrelevant you actually are.

25:16.479 --> 25:17.600
Elephant what?

25:17.600 --> 25:20.479
I feel irrelevant up here, and I...

25:21.639 --> 25:24.519
I don't know, I wonder whether all
my problems with Barney and Bevan,

25:24.519 --> 25:26.839
- whether...
- You'll find love again.

25:26.839 --> 25:28.000
You will.

25:28.959 --> 25:30.400
I know a couple of guys

25:30.400 --> 25:33.200
who'd be quite happy
to go on a date with you.

25:33.200 --> 25:35.400
And I can tell you this,

25:35.400 --> 25:37.959
they wouldn't dump you at the altar

25:37.959 --> 25:41.079
or run-off to Sicily
with a Monica Bellucci look-alike.

25:42.479 --> 25:46.159
Yes, you might be a bit
long in the tooth to have more kids.

25:46.159 --> 25:47.639
(SOBS) Oh, God.

25:48.560 --> 25:50.759
You ever thought about buying a cat?

25:50.759 --> 25:52.319
(CRIES)

25:52.400 --> 25:53.560
Oh, God.

25:53.560 --> 25:56.600
You're a very difficult person
to comfort, you know that?

25:56.600 --> 26:00.079
...those of us who have known
Senator Greene these many years,

26:00.079 --> 26:03.239
this was a train wreck
that was always going to happen.

26:03.239 --> 26:06.959
His sad, infantile behaviour
was always going to erupt.

26:07.959 --> 26:10.879
Now, what damage has this done
to our standing with the US?

26:10.879 --> 26:14.720
Notify me if anyone mentions
the 293(B) amendment.

26:14.720 --> 26:16.000
What?

26:16.000 --> 26:18.720
You know, the Consumer Protection
and Trade Practices,

26:18.720 --> 26:21.360
whatever the fuck it's now called.
Just let me know.

26:21.360 --> 26:23.159
...he step down from
this high public office.

26:23.639 --> 26:24.920
Joe.

26:28.280 --> 26:30.039
Is it true you've offered Cleaver Greene

26:30.039 --> 26:31.439
a place on the ATSAC committee?

26:31.439 --> 26:33.839
I would never do that.
I know how you feel about Greene.

26:33.839 --> 26:34.959
Right.

26:34.959 --> 26:36.680
'Cause you know I'd have to resign

26:36.680 --> 26:38.600
my vice-chairmanship
of the committee if you have.

26:38.600 --> 26:41.920
David, I know we sit
on opposite sides of the House,

26:41.920 --> 26:44.400
but I'm not your enemy, mate.

26:44.400 --> 26:45.920
Even though you were the arsehole

26:45.920 --> 26:48.239
who opposed me
on the Trade Practices Bill.

26:48.239 --> 26:49.839
Don't get me started on that.

26:49.839 --> 26:53.039
They are killing small traders,
fixing prices.

26:53.039 --> 26:56.119
If you relax the laws governing them,
God help small businesspeople.

26:56.119 --> 26:59.200
Look, I put Cleaver on Primary
Produce to keep him out of the way.

26:59.200 --> 27:00.519
The milk committee?

27:00.519 --> 27:02.959
What kind of sane person would want
to sit on the milk committee?

27:03.479 --> 27:05.759
Listen, when are you back from
Paris? Let's do a lunch.

27:05.759 --> 27:07.000
Wednesday fortnight.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.280
I miss the Tuesday sitting,
but I'll be back for the real stuff.

27:09.280 --> 27:12.319
Listen, mate, you have a great trip, OK?

27:12.319 --> 27:14.959
I'll be really interested
to see that report when you return.

27:14.959 --> 27:16.519
- Thanks, Joe.
- Alright.

27:22.439 --> 27:24.360
Norm.

27:24.360 --> 27:27.200
We need to bring forward
the Trade Practice amendment vote.

27:28.239 --> 27:29.400
To Tuesday, mate.

27:31.680 --> 27:33.360
We throw to the image of Greene.

27:33.360 --> 27:37.159
We've, uh... blocked out his schlong
with some silly hearts, very funny.

27:37.159 --> 27:38.959
OK, now in your hands, so this is it,

27:38.959 --> 27:40.680
death knell to Cleaver Greene.

27:40.680 --> 27:43.759
- Yes.
- This is the man who put you away.

27:43.759 --> 27:45.519
You've got him
exactly where you want him.

27:45.519 --> 27:48.039
- Release the dogs of war.
- Dogs of war.

27:48.039 --> 27:50.800
In five, four, three...

27:53.039 --> 27:56.079
Cleaver Greene, Oh, Cleaver Greene.

27:56.079 --> 27:58.439
What the hell were you thinking?

27:58.439 --> 28:02.600
Photographing your manhood, then
texting it to a high-level diplomat?

28:02.600 --> 28:04.800
I mean, what act of utter insanity

28:04.800 --> 28:07.239
drives a man to this sort of behaviour?

28:07.239 --> 28:13.039
What leads a man to reduce himself
to this point of humiliation?

28:16.039 --> 28:17.239
Well, he must be suffering.

28:19.800 --> 28:23.680
Wondering why his life
turned out so terribly wrong.

28:24.959 --> 28:26.479
I mean, we all make terrible mistakes

28:26.479 --> 28:28.560
that we have to live with daily.

28:29.200 --> 28:32.639
It... it might hit us
stacking the dishwasher,

28:32.639 --> 28:37.600
or closing the refrigerator
door too loudly...

28:39.280 --> 28:42.000
not folding washing in a
way that reduces ironing.

28:43.920 --> 28:46.720
Was there some incident that
possibly sparked his behaviour...

28:47.920 --> 28:51.680
a deeper cause, buried
somewhere in his past...

28:53.280 --> 28:54.920
maybe even his family?

28:57.600 --> 29:01.280
Perhaps he felt persecuted
by a particular family member.

29:07.800 --> 29:09.479
I'm home, Pumpkin.

29:15.079 --> 29:16.959
Can't have you cooking in the dark, love.

29:16.959 --> 29:18.200
Leave it.

29:19.439 --> 29:20.800
I have a migraine.

29:22.239 --> 29:23.879
- I'll get your tablets.
- Don't.

29:28.680 --> 29:30.319
I'm sorry, love. They...

29:30.319 --> 29:32.200
They made me say that stuff
about your brother.

29:32.200 --> 29:34.039
I tore strips off 'em afterwards.

29:34.039 --> 29:35.360
Yeah, I understand.

29:35.360 --> 29:36.639
It was legals, you know?

29:36.639 --> 29:41.119
God, you should have seen how angry
I got, with all of them.

29:41.119 --> 29:42.800
I lined them up and I sacked them.

29:46.039 --> 29:48.800
- Not eating, yourself, love?
- Migraine.

29:48.800 --> 29:49.839
Yes.

29:50.400 --> 29:52.239
- What is it?
- Soup.

29:52.239 --> 29:54.839
Ooh, smells intriguing.

29:58.360 --> 29:59.759
You mind if I turn the
light on, just so I...

29:59.759 --> 30:02.119
- Do not.
- Yep, that's fine as it is.

30:20.600 --> 30:22.600
Hi, I'm Maryanne.

30:22.600 --> 30:24.600
- No! No!
- (CHILD SHRIEKS)

30:24.600 --> 30:27.319
(SPEAKS INCOHERENTLY)

30:27.319 --> 30:28.720
What are you doing?

30:31.119 --> 30:34.479
Mar... Maryanne was here.

30:34.479 --> 30:36.680
You cannot stay here again.

30:55.839 --> 30:58.039
The US delegation hasn't arrived as yet,

30:58.039 --> 31:02.119
but we can still have
some useful discussions today.

31:02.119 --> 31:06.400
(TRANSLATES)

31:08.280 --> 31:10.280
- (SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
- Hmm?

31:14.519 --> 31:18.839
(SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

31:20.439 --> 31:22.560
No, thank you.

31:23.200 --> 31:24.680
Fair enough.

31:29.560 --> 31:32.119
Wait for my signal.

31:32.119 --> 31:34.680
OK, this is more like it. Tiger.

31:38.680 --> 31:40.400
Seal the premises. Cover the back exit.

31:41.839 --> 31:44.319
Gabriel, Hillary, take
those persons outside.

31:44.319 --> 31:46.159
Gentlemen, please vacate the premises.

31:46.159 --> 31:48.159
- Cover the exits.
- Routine health inspection.

31:48.159 --> 31:50.239
Could you please vacate
the premises immediately?

31:52.800 --> 31:55.720
- Looks like he's moved on.
- Goddammit.

31:55.720 --> 31:57.560
Let's focus on this suburb.

31:57.560 --> 31:59.519
Someone tell me Pine Gap is online now.

31:59.519 --> 32:02.000
- Roger, got that.
- Thank you.

32:07.239 --> 32:08.600
Hello, darling.

32:09.800 --> 32:12.400
Oh, just at the embassy.

32:13.280 --> 32:15.239
Busy, busy, busy.

32:16.360 --> 32:17.560
Mm-hm.

32:19.039 --> 32:21.239
Yes, well, talks start soon.

32:27.039 --> 32:29.119
Please don't talk about him
over the phone.

32:31.119 --> 32:33.000
Yes, I know he's a dick.

32:36.759 --> 32:38.319
My... Yes.

32:40.519 --> 32:42.839
Alright, my love.
I'm going to go to sleep.

32:42.839 --> 32:44.280
Give my love to the kids.

32:45.839 --> 32:47.239
My love to you, too.

32:48.319 --> 32:49.319
Oh...

32:57.600 --> 33:00.680
Why come here if you want
to maintain a low profile?

33:00.680 --> 33:04.319
Well, nobody expects politicians to
be in their actual electoral office.

33:04.319 --> 33:05.680
I need some thinking time, alright?

33:05.680 --> 33:08.800
Till I can prove that little
piece of gristle is not mine,

33:08.800 --> 33:10.600
there's no way
I can establish my innocence.

33:10.600 --> 33:14.039
Well, you'd have to go back to the
point of conception to achieve that.

33:15.079 --> 33:17.879
Hey, darling. What you doing?

33:17.879 --> 33:21.200
Why are small children

33:21.200 --> 33:24.479
dancing with a mad Polish woman

33:24.479 --> 33:25.639
in my electoral office?

33:25.639 --> 33:26.680
When I agreed to this job,

33:26.680 --> 33:29.000
you said that I could
bring Ian to work, so...

33:29.000 --> 33:31.600
Yeah, well, Ian appears
to have cloned himself,

33:31.600 --> 33:35.439
'cause I'm counting about 14 Ians,
and some of 'em in dresses.

33:35.439 --> 33:38.519
Well, Mum just invited a few of his
little friends over, didn't she?

33:38.519 --> 33:40.400
- Oh!
- And, you know, she loves kids, so...

33:40.400 --> 33:43.800
Oh, well, I suppose she needs company
of her own mental age.

33:43.800 --> 33:47.079
It's important that Ian
is around children his own age.

33:47.079 --> 33:49.159
What's important is that I have
my electoral office to my...

33:49.159 --> 33:51.759
- Get 'em out of here!
- Says Mr Buzz-stay.

33:51.759 --> 33:53.560
Oh, don't... That's a whole other...

33:53.560 --> 33:54.560
Who's that?

33:55.039 --> 33:58.079
- It's in your diary.
- I have a diary?

33:58.079 --> 33:59.239
It's Gene Gibson.

34:00.560 --> 34:01.680
Gene, where's he from?

34:01.680 --> 34:03.680
I don't know. America, I think.

34:03.680 --> 34:05.439
- Oh, God!
- He's with that...

34:05.439 --> 34:06.839
I know, I know who he's with.

34:09.280 --> 34:10.920
OK.

34:12.280 --> 34:14.319
Oh, God. OK. OK.

34:16.239 --> 34:17.439
Get out.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.720
- Senator Greene.
- Yeah.

34:23.079 --> 34:24.280
Gene Gibson.

34:25.519 --> 34:28.439
I suspect you know who I am
and why I'm here.

34:28.439 --> 34:30.920
Look, you have my support.

34:30.920 --> 34:32.479
I was given an understanding

34:32.479 --> 34:35.680
there may be some serious issues
between us going forward.

34:36.119 --> 34:38.200
I haven't mentioned his name...

34:39.319 --> 34:41.839
or the fact that it isn't my penis.

34:43.079 --> 34:44.079
Your penis?

34:44.360 --> 34:45.759
And I never will.

34:46.439 --> 34:48.280
OK, so we're good?

34:48.280 --> 34:49.560
We can count on your support?

34:49.560 --> 34:54.839
Totally, totally, in
everything I say or do, or...

34:54.839 --> 34:57.119
- Everything.
- Thank you.

34:57.119 --> 35:00.159
My people will be very happy
to hear of your change of heart.

35:00.159 --> 35:01.439
Good.

35:06.239 --> 35:07.759
Oh, God.

35:07.759 --> 35:09.280
- You made short shrift of him.
- Oh...

35:09.280 --> 35:11.039
I hope you told him where to get off.

35:11.039 --> 35:13.079
Secret Service, they're stalking me.

35:13.079 --> 35:15.600
It's just that they pay
these Yank consultants a fortune

35:15.600 --> 35:16.759
to screw over our farmers.

35:16.759 --> 35:17.920
It makes me sick.

35:22.360 --> 35:25.079
Because Gene is a consultant for...

35:25.079 --> 35:27.600
Oh, I don't know. I don't remember
which big supermarket,

35:27.600 --> 35:29.079
it's in your diary somewhere.

35:29.079 --> 35:30.680
But, I mean, they're all the same.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.079
I have to get the fuck out of here.

35:40.600 --> 35:42.680
This guy's been following us
since we left.

35:45.039 --> 35:47.039
- Go down this one.
- See if we can lose him.

35:47.039 --> 35:49.039
Into the laneway? Are you sure?

35:49.039 --> 35:50.720
Yes, yes. Go, go.

35:50.720 --> 35:52.600
Yeah, do it. Fuck.

35:52.600 --> 35:54.600
If you wish.

35:59.759 --> 36:03.039
Great. I think you've lost him.
We can reverse back out.

36:03.039 --> 36:06.239
I'd be reversing into oncoming
traffic, it's peak hour.

36:06.239 --> 36:08.600
What? Well, we don't
have to wait here, do we?

36:08.600 --> 36:10.360
- Well...
- Well, for how long?

36:11.479 --> 36:13.639
I don't know. Until the end of peak hour.

36:13.639 --> 36:17.439
Oh, God. Well, mate,
you should have said something.

36:17.439 --> 36:20.079
I was born under Russian rule.

36:47.039 --> 36:50.600
May I ask you,
if you wanted to disappear,

36:50.600 --> 36:53.000
why did you choose the milk committee

36:53.000 --> 36:57.039
instead of the Agricultural Tariff
and Subsidy Abrogation Committee?

36:57.039 --> 36:58.879
How do you know
what committees I was offered?

36:58.879 --> 37:01.280
The drivers network, we hear things.

37:01.280 --> 37:04.680
Why would I want to be on a committee
that I can't even pronounce?

37:04.680 --> 37:09.000
Because currently
they are on a fact-finding mission

- What was that?
- Oh...

37:45.239 --> 37:47.639
- He needed a light.
- What do you mean he needed a light?

37:47.639 --> 37:50.439
How did you know he needed a light
from inside the car?

37:50.439 --> 37:51.720
He's Polish.

38:00.239 --> 38:02.680
He gave you an envelope.
What... what was that?

38:02.680 --> 38:04.039
(MUMBLES)

38:04.039 --> 38:07.039
- What?
- I don't know the word in English.

- Ah, I think we are good to go.
- Thank Christ for that.

38:14.200 --> 38:15.920
Oh.

who can prove it wasn't mine.

I'll get you to chuck a U-ey

he was seeing someone on the side.

38:29.800 --> 38:32.119
He was. Chapter five.

38:32.119 --> 38:33.959
But he kept denying it,

38:33.959 --> 38:36.879
but I knew all his
Wednesday afternoon, in-house,

38:36.879 --> 38:40.400
closed-door work meetings
sounded like bullshit.

38:40.400 --> 38:42.439
For me it was Thursday afternoons.

38:42.439 --> 38:44.600
And so I went to his office
on a Wednesday afternoon,

38:44.600 --> 38:47.519
and I said, "Excuse me, I'm so sorry
to interrupt the meeting."

38:47.519 --> 38:48.720
- Mm-hm.
- "But I wonder

38:48.759 --> 38:51.000
if I could have a word with Jason."

- "He's not here,

"because Wednesday afternoons
are his family time,

because I'm a survivor.

- You slept with him, didn't you?
- Yes.

39:21.079 --> 39:23.039
No, and now he's moved back in,

39:23.039 --> 39:25.200
and he's lying on the couch
in his underwear watching League,

39:25.200 --> 39:28.600
and he's telling you he's catching
up with a friend on Monday night?

39:28.600 --> 39:31.000
- I still love him.
- No you don't, Beth.

I'm going to tell you is,

39:50.519 --> 39:51.720
you are going to get through this,

39:51.720 --> 39:53.400
and I know that because I got through it.

Uh... I've got to see her urgently.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.400
Oh, I don't think she'll want to see you.

- It's life-and-death stuff.
- Well, she's with a client.

and move to Sardinia

40:01.600 --> 40:03.519
and open an English-language bookshop.

Stage 23, that's the level
of madness that you reach,

- No, that's Gabe.

- Why?
- For your granddaughter.

40:24.400 --> 40:26.400
So I can monitor her at all times.

40:26.400 --> 40:29.560
Yesterday, I'm sure
she was trying to say "mummy".

Well, maybe she was trying to say,
"This is a bit mental, Mummy."

- Oh, Jesus.

is if somebody who was intimate with me

will publicly declare
that that is not me.

It was so long ago.

What do you mean you don't remember?
We were married 15 years.

42:35.479 --> 42:37.479
We were married for eight years,
I don't count the last four,

42:37.479 --> 42:39.319
and it wasn't something I spent
a lot of time looking at,

42:39.319 --> 42:40.319
to be honest.

42:40.319 --> 42:44.479
You used to call me The Plough.

42:44.479 --> 42:46.479
I have never called you The Plough.

42:46.479 --> 42:48.360

- I called you El Fucko.
- Oh, come on.

You must remember something.

going to catch something from it.

quite a lot

43:05.800 --> 43:07.759
before you had a baby with my son.

- Ah...
- Oh, my gosh.

- Huh?
- What's going on?

43:12.680 --> 43:14.639
Well, it's not me, is it?

43:15.959 --> 43:18.759
- That's not me.
- I don't know!

43:18.759 --> 43:21.479

in the bad old days.

the very big ones.

- You do remember those.
- Oh, come on, you two.

his had a bend in it, didn't it,

43:35.959 --> 43:36.959
from memory?

43:36.959 --> 43:38.959
Well, it was more of a kink,
really, wasn't it?

43:38.959 --> 43:41.560
Yes. And the vein?!

43:41.560 --> 43:43.280
Yes, he had a big blue vein.

43:43.280 --> 43:45.239
Yep, OK, yep, it's all coming back to me.

43:45.239 --> 43:47.879
- I don't think this is it.
- No, you're right. It's not yours.

a little more cheerful at the news

that somebody believed me,
but, yes, thank you.

44:00.879 --> 44:04.360

you both to publicly declare...

- No. No way.

there is no rock bottom.

as their leader

46:39.800 --> 46:41.879
under the sort of strain you're under.

46:41.879 --> 46:43.680
(GROANS) Where am I now?

46:43.680 --> 46:44.759
Does it matter?

46:44.759 --> 46:47.800
Professionally,
well, you're not at a high point.

46:47.800 --> 46:52.879
I have two witnesses who will
testify that is not my penis.

46:52.879 --> 46:55.000
- I know it isn't yours.
- You know it's not?

46:55.000 --> 46:56.439
How do you know it's not mine?

46:56.439 --> 46:58.639
Because I've seen the real thing.

46:58.639 --> 47:01.879
- What?
- It came across my desk yesterday.

47:03.239 --> 47:06.920
Oh, no. Oh, see, that's not...

47:06.920 --> 47:09.519
That's... They're balls.

47:09.519 --> 47:12.839
They wake me up in the morning
with the basketballs.

47:12.839 --> 47:15.839
Fortunately,
Mr Wang is a dear friend of mine,

47:15.839 --> 47:18.039
and I've told him
it was a complete misunderstanding

47:18.039 --> 47:20.720
and he's agreed
to put a hold on taking it further.

47:20.720 --> 47:23.280
Mate... Oh, mate.

47:23.280 --> 47:24.680
Thank you so much.

47:24.680 --> 47:27.920
I could take 80% of all this away
from you.

47:27.920 --> 47:30.519
- The Americans, paedophilia...
- It's not paedophilia.

47:30.519 --> 47:33.879
But if I'm going to do this for you,
mate, I've got to know something.

47:37.280 --> 47:38.439
Are you friend...

47:39.839 --> 47:41.400
or foe?

47:42.720 --> 47:44.759
SPEAKER: Lock the doors.

47:44.759 --> 47:47.079
Those in favour of the proposed amendment

47:47.079 --> 47:52.920
to section 293(B) of the
Competition and Consumer Act,

47:52.920 --> 47:56.280
the ayes to my right,
the noes to the left.

48:16.319 --> 48:18.759
Have you found a side that suits you
yet, Senator Greene?

48:18.759 --> 48:20.400
No.

48:33.280 --> 48:35.600
LINUS: Contrary to the fake news

48:35.600 --> 48:38.800
that's been circulating
as to my condition,

48:38.800 --> 48:42.720
I came down with a severe head cold
and was ordered to rest.

48:42.720 --> 48:46.039
And now that I have
recovered, I am headed to...

48:48.720 --> 48:49.720
China.

48:49.720 --> 48:53.239
...meet my Chinese counterpart, Li Hyon.

48:53.239 --> 48:54.680
These are times

48:54.680 --> 49:00.400
where sound judgement
and goodwill between men are needed.

49:00.400 --> 49:02.759
But I leave here today

49:02.759 --> 49:04.519
with the belief

49:04.519 --> 49:08.479
that we, as a people,
are destined for a better world.

49:14.159 --> 49:17.879
The lunatic is on a plane now
and out of here.

49:18.360 --> 49:20.560
We have no treaty

49:20.560 --> 49:23.560
and the Chinese are talking about
severing trade ties,

49:23.560 --> 49:25.119
but we are not at war.

49:25.119 --> 49:26.879
On the good news front,

49:26.879 --> 49:29.959
the public are responding
to your leadership on security

49:29.959 --> 49:31.639
and figures are on the rise.

49:31.639 --> 49:33.479
- GARETH: Excuse me, Prime Minister.
- Give me 15.

49:33.479 --> 49:35.560
No, now. Someone you need to meet.

49:35.560 --> 49:37.400
You lot, move yourselves.
Come on, piss off.

49:38.280 --> 49:39.800
Come on in here, Jake.

49:39.800 --> 49:41.360
Come on.

49:42.759 --> 49:46.200
Prime Minister, this is Jake.
Jake, this is our country's leader.

49:46.200 --> 49:48.680
- G'day. Lovely to meet you.
- What is this about?

49:48.680 --> 49:52.959
Well, Jake is with our maintenance
folk at New Parliament House.

49:52.959 --> 49:55.400
Go on, mate. You tell her.
You'll be right.

49:56.079 --> 49:58.439
It's a bit embarrassing, actually.

49:59.800 --> 50:03.039
Gordy... he's my brother,

50:03.039 --> 50:05.879
so I'm not blaming him
when I tell you this.

50:05.879 --> 50:07.720
This was an accident.

50:07.720 --> 50:12.039
But the sluice valve that connects
to the floor flange on the S pipe,

50:12.039 --> 50:14.680
that takes the sewage out,
it was left open,

50:14.680 --> 50:17.439
and one of the elbow joints had corroded.

50:17.439 --> 50:20.239
Now, why they didn't use
a plastic elbow joint...

50:20.239 --> 50:22.800
What the hell is he talking about?
Just stay with him.

50:23.159 --> 50:26.039
Anyway... It kind of...

50:26.720 --> 50:29.200
ruptured and blew out into the storeroom

50:29.200 --> 50:32.200
where we keep the cleaning products

50:32.200 --> 50:35.720
and they spilt and kind of
must have mixed together,

50:35.720 --> 50:37.639
and wouldn't you know it,

50:37.639 --> 50:42.079
Bruno was having a quiet fag
and it kind of exploded.

50:42.079 --> 50:43.519
I don't understand.

50:43.519 --> 50:46.159
Not terrorists, Angela.

50:46.159 --> 50:47.360
Turds...

50:47.360 --> 50:50.000
and cleaning fluids in
a lethal combination.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.200
Ah, yeah, definitely not terrorists.

50:52.200 --> 50:54.039
This was just an accident.

50:54.039 --> 50:56.159
And the good news
is we should be up and operational

50:56.159 --> 50:57.439
by the end of the week.

50:58.920 --> 51:01.079
Not a terrorist attack, you say?

51:01.079 --> 51:03.280
No. No worries on that front.

51:03.280 --> 51:06.039
Oh, you think no worries, do you?

51:06.039 --> 51:08.159
You fuckin' moron!

51:09.560 --> 51:15.319
After Gareth and I
introduce a Level 7 security alert,

51:15.319 --> 51:19.239
calling in the Army
and doing hourly press announcements

51:19.239 --> 51:21.800
telling the public
their lives hang in the balance.

51:21.800 --> 51:27.000
No... just a sluice valve and
buckets of shit and bleach.

51:29.639 --> 51:31.600
Gareth, I wonder if you could take...

51:32.800 --> 51:34.400
- Jake.
- Jake...

51:36.119 --> 51:37.879
to the windowless office at the rear.

51:37.879 --> 51:39.159
Whoa.

51:39.159 --> 51:42.239
Oh, and Gareth,
no-one is to go in or out of the room

51:42.239 --> 51:43.720
until further notice.

51:44.360 --> 51:45.839
Come on, mate.

51:47.200 --> 51:48.600
You'll be sweet.

51:54.600 --> 51:55.600
Joe...

51:56.600 --> 51:59.119
Fuck!

52:10.639 --> 52:14.560
I'm really learning to hate you.

52:26.039 --> 52:28.319
I think that you look
really lovely as a zebra.

52:28.319 --> 52:30.920
I have a practice back
in Sydney, Virginia...

52:30.959 --> 52:33.039
I need you, Wendy.

52:33.039 --> 52:35.439
I can't accommodate seven people here.

52:35.439 --> 52:38.079
There are two beds here, alright,
and one of them is mine.

52:38.079 --> 52:41.079
- I'm here to help.
- I'm sure you are, mate.

52:41.079 --> 52:43.079
You see, Cleaver,

52:43.079 --> 52:44.600
I'm this nation's Trump.

52:44.600 --> 52:46.039
I am a tycoon...

52:46.039 --> 52:47.439
yes, and I'm tiny.

52:47.439 --> 52:49.720
Look! I'm a tiny tycoon!

52:49.720 --> 52:53.560
Why do we put up with this
from these morons?
