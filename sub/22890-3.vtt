I'm ready to get serious,
you know.

08:44.433 --> 08:47.633
Just let us show you
that we're invested in this.

08:49.300 --> 08:51.433
Okay, now I'll tell you what,
okay.

08:51.467 --> 08:53.433
At a later date,
we'll have another meeting.

08:53.433 --> 08:55.033
- Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

08:55.033 --> 08:56.500
Hug Okay.
- No.

08:56.533 --> 08:58.633
- Bye, Tom.
- Bye, guys. Thanks again.

08:58.667 --> 09:01.734
- I think they have
a standing order, Jax and Tom,

09:01.767 --> 09:04.300
with the balloon people
and the flower people

09:04.333 --> 09:06.066
that just says "I'm Sorry"
on it.

09:06.066 --> 09:07.333
Coming up...

09:07.367 --> 09:10.600
- Yeah, girl.
- Whoa. Oh, whoa.

09:10.633 --> 09:13.033
- Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.

09:13.066 --> 09:15.100
Oh, my God.

09:26.633 --> 09:28.600

Sur Restaurant.

You said Friday?

09:30.100 --> 09:32.066
- ♪ I'ma be me ♪

09:32.066 --> 09:33.734
- Stassi wanted to know,
you know,

09:33.734 --> 09:35.600
exactly what goes into
planning a party.

09:35.633 --> 09:37.600
So I said just come here early.

09:37.600 --> 09:39.000
She can get an idea

09:39.033 --> 09:40.600
of what it takes
to organize it.

09:40.633 --> 09:41.767
- Hey!
- Okay, here you are.

09:41.767 --> 09:43.100
- Hello.

09:43.100 --> 09:44.300
- Okay.
- Hi, good.

09:44.333 --> 09:45.633
- I'm just going to tell you

09:45.667 --> 09:47.166
what we've done
for this party.

09:47.200 --> 09:48.767
We've done the flowers
in-house.

09:48.767 --> 09:50.734
Some people are going
to arrange the florist,

09:50.767 --> 09:52.433
which is something
you would do.

09:52.467 --> 09:54.100
- Right.
- They wanted a screen,

09:54.100 --> 09:55.233
which is something
you would do.

09:55.266 --> 09:56.633
Straighten up the candles,

09:56.633 --> 09:58.633
check the levels
of the music,

09:58.667 --> 10:01.200
make sure the trays
are set up for the drinks.

10:01.233 --> 10:02.333
- Make sure everything
looks perfect.

10:02.367 --> 10:03.367
- Yeah.

10:03.367 --> 10:04.767
- Full disclosure:

10:04.767 --> 10:06.166
Event planning isn't something

10:06.200 --> 10:07.600
I grew up dreaming about.

10:07.633 --> 10:10.066
But what I want to be
is a boss

10:10.100 --> 10:11.567
like Lisa Vanderpump.

10:11.600 --> 10:14.066
And bosses know how
to do awesome things

10:14.100 --> 10:15.500
like throwing parties.

10:15.500 --> 10:17.767
- And work on theme.
- Yeah, and I--

10:18.000 --> 10:19.333
- You've got to find
some ideas

10:19.367 --> 10:21.200
if it's like a baby shower.

10:21.233 --> 10:23.266
Or you can find some--
- If you're gonna do, like,

10:23.266 --> 10:25.600
a bridal shower, change
the color of the napkins,

10:25.633 --> 10:27.066
or you would have
a set menu,

10:27.100 --> 10:29.000
or you decide on the cocktails.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.100
There's so many things to do.
Do you see what I mean?

10:31.133 --> 10:32.266
- Right.

10:32.266 --> 10:34.066
- You are not the...

10:34.100 --> 10:35.533
you're not the boss
of the servers.

10:35.533 --> 10:37.200
I don't want to have
any friction.

10:37.233 --> 10:39.266
Like yesterday Scheana
was upset a bit

10:39.266 --> 10:42.533
and said "How come Stassi
is gonna be our boss?"

10:42.533 --> 10:44.333
I think it's official now.

10:44.367 --> 10:47.233
Like, Stassi's gonna help
with the special events.

10:47.266 --> 10:49.633
- Yep, Stassi's never planned
an event in her life.

10:49.667 --> 10:52.633
- And she gets to basically
be our boss.

10:52.667 --> 10:54.667
- So clear this up
with those girls

10:54.700 --> 10:56.600
because they were like
quite pissed.

10:56.633 --> 10:58.000
- I should be annoyed,

10:58.000 --> 11:00.500
but I'm not, honestly,

11:00.533 --> 11:02.000
because it means that
it bothers her

11:02.033 --> 11:03.633
that, like, I'm up here
right now

11:03.667 --> 11:05.033
and she's, like, down there.

11:05.033 --> 11:06.533
I'm not bossing anyone around.

11:06.567 --> 11:08.633
- That's a first.
That's a good thing.

11:08.667 --> 11:11.700
It's really wonderful that
the restaurants are thriving,

11:11.734 --> 11:14.567
and this is exactly
the kind of help I need.

11:14.600 --> 11:17.433
It would be nice to see
Stassi now

11:17.433 --> 11:19.567
mature as much
as the business has.

11:19.567 --> 11:22.500
- So my tables are done.

11:22.533 --> 11:24.700
- You need to polish all
the glasses in the main room

11:24.734 --> 11:27.000
and then make sure
the coffee bar is cleaned.

11:27.033 --> 11:29.000
- Thank you, Katie.

11:29.033 --> 11:31.266
- But I suppose I can't wish
for everything.

11:31.300 --> 11:33.100
Okay.
- I don't want to mess it up.

11:33.133 --> 11:36.133
I just want us all to be
on the same--I want to be--

11:36.166 --> 11:38.000
- We've been
on the same page for 12 years.

11:38.033 --> 11:39.700
You need to be
on the same page as us.

11:39.700 --> 11:41.033
- Okay.

11:41.066 --> 11:45.400

11:47.066 --> 11:49.000

11:51.166 --> 11:53.266

doing in here?

11:53.300 --> 11:56.000

11:56.033 --> 11:59.667
- Yeah, we're gonna have
a girls party for Brittany

11:59.700 --> 12:00.600
at Stassi's.

12:02.100 --> 12:03.600
- It's going to be
a pajama party,

12:03.600 --> 12:05.533
and we're going to have

12:05.567 --> 12:07.533

like a Bloody Mary bar.

12:07.567 --> 12:09.133
- That's cool.
- Tequila shots, of course.

12:09.166 --> 12:11.066
The point of this party
tonight

12:11.100 --> 12:13.200
is to rally behind Brittany
and let her know

12:13.233 --> 12:15.266
that she shouldn't be scared

12:15.300 --> 12:19.033
of starting over
and dump his ass.

12:19.066 --> 12:21.000
I'm going to bring
that shotgun thing

12:21.033 --> 12:22.333
that we have that you, like,

12:22.333 --> 12:24.700
squirt the shot
into the mouth.

12:24.734 --> 12:26.467
- No, I have it.

12:26.500 --> 12:28.200
- Why don't we utilize that
more often?

12:28.233 --> 12:29.700
- Come in.

12:29.734 --> 12:31.333
Hey, what up, dude?

12:31.367 --> 12:33.433
- Somebody call
a business partner?

12:33.467 --> 12:35.700
I don't know what to say, sh--.

12:35.734 --> 12:38.600
- Bad boy's coming
for his makeout session.

12:38.633 --> 12:40.233
- Yeah, there it is.

12:40.266 --> 12:41.467
- I let him kiss me
on the lips maybe,

12:41.500 --> 12:43.467
but Tom goes open mouth.

12:43.500 --> 12:46.166
- You guys look all--you guys
got to have, like, notepads?

12:46.200 --> 12:47.467
- Well, you know,
it's not idea time yet.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.166
First, we have to,
you know,

12:49.200 --> 12:51.567
be on the same page
with Ken and Lisa.

12:51.600 --> 12:54.567
- Yes, but I found
this amazing machine

12:54.600 --> 12:57.500
that can freeze
pretty much any drink,

12:57.500 --> 12:59.033
even, like, 80-proof drinks.

12:59.066 --> 13:00.500
So you serve a shot
on a wooden spoon.

13:00.533 --> 13:02.166
- We're getting
ahead of ourselves now.

13:02.200 --> 13:04.033
- You're getting ahead.
- As of now,

13:04.066 --> 13:06.467
they're mulling it over
and, you know, reassessing

13:06.500 --> 13:08.367
whether or not they want
to move forward with us.

13:08.400 --> 13:09.667
- Yeah.

13:09.667 --> 13:11.000
I feel like everyone either has

13:11.000 --> 13:12.533
that boyfriend or girlfriend

13:12.567 --> 13:15.066
that they're like the one
that got away.

13:15.100 --> 13:20.133
If Tom Tom becomes
the one that got away,

13:20.133 --> 13:23.000
I think it would haunt me
for the rest of my life.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.333
- From now on, if we vent,

13:24.367 --> 13:25.767
let's just vent
to each other.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.367
- Yeah.
- Let's just keep it right here.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.667
Then our public forward face

13:29.700 --> 13:31.633
we'll keep it f---ing
super positive.

13:31.667 --> 13:34.467
- Especially around Ken and Lisa
it's just like positivity.

13:34.500 --> 13:37.400
Tom and I have been married
almost a year,

13:37.400 --> 13:40.000
and Tom's now getting
his career straightened out.

13:40.033 --> 13:42.667
It just makes me very proud
to see him,

13:42.700 --> 13:45.266
you know,
taking initiative like this.

13:45.266 --> 13:47.000

13:47.033 --> 13:48.633

13:48.667 --> 13:50.667

of the talking.

13:50.700 --> 13:53.367
But I'm going to be prepared.
I'm not going to be flailing.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.166
I'm not going to be saying,
"I don't know, I don't know."

13:56.166 --> 13:58.133

you can bring the flair,

13:58.166 --> 13:59.567
and they can bring the class.

13:59.567 --> 14:01.433

I started riding horses
when I was six years old.

14:35.333 --> 14:38.200
And for a long time,
I was really competitive.

14:38.233 --> 14:41.567

are kind of going through

14:56.066 --> 14:57.700
a weird point right now,

14:57.734 --> 15:00.000
and being able to go out
to the barn and ride

15:00.033 --> 15:02.567

centers me.

34:31.467 --> 34:33.033
Why are you here?

34:33.066 --> 34:35.600
- Yes, I have a man
that provides me

34:35.633 --> 34:37.734
with really amazing things.

34:37.767 --> 34:39.600
But my man is not
an ATM machine.

34:39.600 --> 34:42.333
I mean, I have my own bills
to pay.

34:42.367 --> 34:44.066
- Whenever things
got a little tough,

34:44.100 --> 34:46.033
you ran like a little rabbit.

34:46.066 --> 34:47.100
You didn't pick up the phone.

34:47.133 --> 34:48.500
You were inconsistent.

34:48.500 --> 34:50.200
- The pressure
just made me cave.

34:50.233 --> 34:53.367
I suffer from anxiety.
It's just a fact of life.

34:53.400 --> 34:56.467
- You've got to grow
from this, Lala.

34:56.500 --> 34:59.066
Yeah, but you created
a lot of that pressure

34:59.100 --> 35:00.333
because you weren't honest

35:00.367 --> 35:01.767
about so many things.
- Right.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.500
Last year,
I was in a relationship

35:04.533 --> 35:07.333
with the same person that
I'm in a relationship with now.

35:07.367 --> 35:09.633
I made up all sorts of lies

35:09.633 --> 35:12.433
just to protect
this human being,

35:12.467 --> 35:15.100
and I feel like it took
my anxiety through the roof.

35:15.100 --> 35:16.700
I don't have
a married boyfriend.

35:16.734 --> 35:18.633
Who are you talking about?

35:18.633 --> 35:20.367
- You got the Range Rover--

35:20.367 --> 35:23.133
- If you want a Range Rover,
you can get one too.

35:23.166 --> 35:25.100
- You're nobody.
- Nobody's talking to you.

35:25.133 --> 35:28.133
- You're nobody. Go sling some
more d---s for Range Rovers.

35:28.133 --> 35:29.533
Yeah.
- Asshole.

35:29.533 --> 35:31.367
They called me out
on my bullsh--.

35:31.400 --> 35:32.767
You're right, you can't
afford a Range Rover

35:33.000 --> 35:34.266
on a hostess salary.

35:34.300 --> 35:35.533
I said it.

35:35.533 --> 35:37.233
I made the wrong choice.

35:37.266 --> 35:38.533
I should've been honest,

35:38.533 --> 35:40.667
and, yes, I did leave you
hanging.

35:40.700 --> 35:42.500
But I'm asking you
to forgive me

35:42.533 --> 35:44.467
for the way I acted last year.

35:44.500 --> 35:49.066
You have been someone
who has really fought for me.

35:49.100 --> 35:50.467
- I've always like you
very much, Lala.

35:50.500 --> 35:52.133
You know that,

35:52.133 --> 35:53.533
and I've always
had a lot of time for you.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.266
- So I'm asking you

35:59.266 --> 36:04.400
to just see that I've...
changed a lot.

36:06.066 --> 36:08.066
- Okay.

36:09.333 --> 36:13.033
- Are you saying "Okay"
like I can come back

36:13.033 --> 36:15.033
and be a hostess
at your restaurant?

36:15.066 --> 36:17.533
- I'm saying yes, you can.

36:17.567 --> 36:19.667
Lala was always
a fabulous hostess.

36:19.700 --> 36:21.500
She's got a great
kind of joie de vivre.

36:21.533 --> 36:24.300
And underneath this kind of
tough exterior

36:24.333 --> 36:27.567
is really like
a little lost puppy.

36:27.567 --> 36:31.300
But if I see one inkling

36:31.333 --> 36:33.533
of you being unreliable,

36:33.567 --> 36:35.367
we will be done.

36:35.400 --> 36:37.433
- You can count on me.

36:37.433 --> 36:39.000
- If you give me what I want,

36:39.033 --> 36:41.033
then I'm happy
to have you back.

36:41.033 --> 36:43.300
- I give everybody
what they want.

36:43.300 --> 36:45.567
- So I've heard.
Now off you go.

36:45.600 --> 36:48.734
- You always have to go there
with me.

36:48.734 --> 36:51.133
Thank you, Lisa.

36:51.166 --> 36:52.300
- Coming up...

36:52.333 --> 36:53.734
- I didn't know that you

36:53.734 --> 36:55.000
actually f---ed her
more than once.

36:56.734 --> 36:58.433
One time is ten times.
It doesn't make a difference.

36:58.467 --> 37:01.200
- This changes everything,
you piece of sh--!

37:06.333 --> 37:07.000

37:07.000 --> 37:07.266

37:12.734 --> 37:14.467
I haven't seen you since
the whole thing went down.

37:14.467 --> 37:16.333
- It's getting better.

37:16.367 --> 37:18.166
- It's getting better.
The sex has never been better,

37:18.200 --> 37:19.567
I'll tell you that.
I think she's just really

37:19.600 --> 37:21.667
hate-f---ing me, but...

37:21.700 --> 37:23.567
- Well, that's how you
and James crushed your beef.

37:23.600 --> 37:26.333
You guys just hate-f---ed
it out.

37:26.333 --> 37:27.533
- By no means is this resolved.

37:27.567 --> 37:29.200
But it's baby steps.

37:29.233 --> 37:30.500
You know, we're working
towards it.

37:30.533 --> 37:32.066
- If things are going
to continue on,

37:32.100 --> 37:33.567
I think you should
be prepared.

37:33.600 --> 37:35.467
- You know we love you, man.

37:35.500 --> 37:37.500
So we thought we'd take
some precautionary measures

37:37.533 --> 37:39.333
just to make sure that you
don't f--- up in the future.

37:39.367 --> 37:41.100
- Sh--.

37:41.100 --> 37:43.367
- Sometimes you're gonna
wanna go out.

37:43.400 --> 37:45.633
You're gonna want Brittany
to be very secure

37:45.667 --> 37:47.500
that you're going out
and you're not causing trouble.

37:47.500 --> 37:52.100
So, this is a locking
chastity cock ring.

37:52.100 --> 37:53.633
- Holy cow.

37:53.633 --> 37:55.333
- See, it locks.

37:55.367 --> 37:58.100
See, look at--it comes
with a volcano dick hole.

37:58.133 --> 38:00.066
- You know I have a really
big penis. So I don't know.

38:00.100 --> 38:01.734
- No, you put it in there
when it's soft.

38:05.734 --> 38:08.200
- I don't know what I'm--
I'm so confused.

38:08.233 --> 38:10.266
I don't know what
I'm going to do.

38:10.300 --> 38:13.633
I just, like, don't want
to upset anybody,

38:13.667 --> 38:16.767
and I know that I'm, like,
making stupid moves.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.533
But I just, like,
don't know what to do.

38:18.533 --> 38:20.266
- Brittany, we said
we are not judging.

38:20.300 --> 38:22.100
We are here to support you.
- I know. I know.

38:22.133 --> 38:25.333
- Is he telling you
that it was a one

38:25.367 --> 38:28.066
Or is he--it wasn't.
- Yeah.

38:29.400 --> 38:31.200
- I'm absolutely 100% sure.

38:31.233 --> 38:33.266
- I've heard that.
I've heard--

38:33.300 --> 38:35.233
- From Faith, from Jesse,
from Logan.

38:35.266 --> 38:38.066
I mean, everyone that I've
interacted with recently

38:38.100 --> 38:39.633
has all been just like,

38:39.667 --> 38:41.233
"Oh, yeah, no,
it was like a bunch of times."

38:41.266 --> 38:43.000
If they just know that,

38:43.000 --> 38:44.500
then I don't know where
they would get that from

38:44.533 --> 38:47.400
if that wasn't the case.

38:47.433 --> 38:50.266
- With Jax, you will
always hear things.

38:50.266 --> 38:52.033
Maybe a few of them
aren't true.

38:52.066 --> 38:55.000
But for the most part
they're gonna be true.

38:55.033 --> 38:56.166
- I figured he's probably
telling you

38:56.200 --> 38:58.033
it was a one-time thing and--

38:58.033 --> 38:59.500
- Because if he admits to once
then that's okay,

38:59.533 --> 39:00.667
then he's forgiven.

39:00.700 --> 39:02.166
- And then he does the thing

39:02.200 --> 39:03.667
where he goes,
"Well, come on.

39:03.700 --> 39:05.433
"Once, twice, five times,
ten times.

39:05.433 --> 39:07.367
There's no difference."
That's what he does.

39:07.400 --> 39:09.300
- I just want to call him and
be like, it was more than once!

39:09.333 --> 39:11.100
- If you wanna call him,
we can f---ing call him.

39:11.133 --> 39:12.533
- I'm just gonna call him,
and I'm gonna put it

39:12.567 --> 39:15.133
on speaker phone
for all of you guys to hear.

39:15.166 --> 39:18.000
- I'm so scared.

39:18.033 --> 39:19.500
- Oh, sh--, sorry.

39:21.333 --> 39:23.433
- How many times
did it happen with Faith?

39:23.433 --> 39:26.433
- Once, honey. That's it.
- No, tell me the truth.

39:26.433 --> 39:28.700
- I swear on my life.
- I have proof.

39:28.734 --> 39:30.233
- I'm gonna rush outside
for a second, sorry.

39:30.266 --> 39:32.233
- Say she's here.
- She's here.

39:32.266 --> 39:34.667
Brittany, Brittany,
Brittany, Brittany, stop.

39:34.700 --> 39:36.667
- She's lying.

39:36.700 --> 39:39.166
Why is she there?
Why is she there?

39:39.200 --> 39:41.200
Why are you setting me up?
Why are you doing this?

39:41.200 --> 39:42.734
We've been talking.
We're working this--

39:42.767 --> 39:45.066
- Yes, but I didn't know
that you actually f---ed her

39:45.100 --> 39:46.400
more than once.

39:46.433 --> 39:47.667
- I didn't--
I didn't do it.

39:47.700 --> 39:49.300
It's only one time.

39:49.333 --> 39:51.400
- Jax, she's obviously
not f---ing here.

39:51.433 --> 39:53.266
I would've f---ing
stabbed her ass.

39:53.300 --> 39:54.600
She's obviously not here.

39:54.633 --> 39:56.333
- Oh my God,
don't do that to me.

39:56.333 --> 39:57.333
- I want you to tell the truth
for once.

39:59.200 --> 40:01.000
I swear to God.

40:01.033 --> 40:02.333
- All I asked
was for the f---ing truth,

40:02.367 --> 40:04.300
and you didn't
give me the truth.

40:04.333 --> 40:06.200
- What does it matter
if I did it two or three times?

40:08.333 --> 40:10.567
- You're f---ing disgusting!
I f---ing hate you!

40:10.600 --> 40:13.200
- I would tell you if I did it
two, three, four, five times.

40:13.200 --> 40:14.400
What's the difference
between one time and ten times?

40:14.433 --> 40:15.567
It doesn't make a difference.

40:15.600 --> 40:17.100
- This changes everything,

40:17.133 --> 40:18.200
you piece of sh--!

40:18.233 --> 40:19.767
It changes everything.

40:19.767 --> 40:21.633
I can't wait.
I can't wait to see you again.

40:21.667 --> 40:24.433
- I didn't do anything.
- You are f---ing done.

40:24.467 --> 40:25.767
- You piece of sh--.

40:25.767 --> 40:27.500
- I promise you,
I didn't do it. Shut up!

40:27.533 --> 40:30.367
I said I didn't do it!

40:30.400 --> 40:32.700
Would you stop?
Would you stop?

40:32.734 --> 40:34.500
- The attitude you gave me
proves to me

40:34.500 --> 40:35.633
you're not f---ing changing
a damn thing.

40:35.633 --> 40:36.767
We're done.

40:36.767 --> 40:38.633

41:37.400 --> 41:38.667

Dude, he can't keep
his hands off of me."

42:49.100 --> 42:51.133
They made out.
He was like touchy-feely.
