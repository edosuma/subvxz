00:02.503 --> 00:04.505
Parents like to drag kids

00:02.503 --> 00:04.505
to these, uh,

00:04.505 --> 00:05.923
historical sites on vacation.

00:05.923 --> 00:07.967
I remember going

00:05.923 --> 00:07.967
to Colonial Williamsburg,

00:07.967 --> 00:11.637
and you see the supposedly

00:07.967 --> 00:11.637
authentic blacksmith there.

00:11.637 --> 00:13.096
You know, he's got

00:11.637 --> 00:13.096
the three-cornered hat

00:13.096 --> 00:15.098
and the knickers

00:13.096 --> 00:15.098
and the Def Leppard T-shirt.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.727
My parents took me

00:16.517 --> 00:18.727
to the Amish country,

00:18.727 --> 00:20.771
which, to a kid,

00:18.727 --> 00:20.771
to see a bunch of people

00:20.771 --> 00:22.773
that have no cars,

00:20.771 --> 00:22.773
no TV, no phone,

00:22.773 --> 00:25.233
they go,

00:22.773 --> 00:25.233
"So what? Neither do I."

00:25.233 --> 00:27.402
So it's a whole community

00:25.233 --> 00:27.402
that's been grounded.

00:27.402 --> 00:29.321
And that's the way

00:27.402 --> 00:29.321
they should punish the kids

00:29.321 --> 00:30.531
after they take them home.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.073
"All right, son,

00:30.531 --> 00:32.073
get up to your room.

00:32.073 --> 00:33.701
"That's it. I've had it.

00:33.701 --> 00:36.077
"You are Amish, young man,

00:33.701 --> 00:36.077
for the rest of this weekend.

00:36.077 --> 00:37.621
"Did you hear me? Amish.

00:37.621 --> 00:39.080
"And don't come down

00:39.080 --> 00:41.166
till you make some noodles

00:39.080 --> 00:41.166
and raise a barn."

00:46.714 --> 00:47.965
So they have

00:46.714 --> 00:47.965
a tour guide.

00:47.965 --> 00:48.924
He takes you around,

00:48.924 --> 00:50.258
shows you

00:48.924 --> 00:50.258
the battlefield,

00:50.258 --> 00:51.677
gives you a little bit

00:50.258 --> 00:51.677
of the history.

00:51.677 --> 00:53.052
Wow. How far

00:51.677 --> 00:53.052
is Gettysburg?

00:53.052 --> 00:54.638
I'd like to go there.

00:53.052 --> 00:54.638
About three hours.

00:54.638 --> 00:55.890
MAN:

00:54.638 --> 00:55.890
Tommy, you're on.

00:55.890 --> 00:57.725
Gotta go.

00:55.890 --> 00:57.725
Have a good set.

01:00.769 --> 01:02.354
What'd they do

01:00.769 --> 01:02.354
for toilet paper

01:02.354 --> 01:04.481
in the Civil War?

01:04.481 --> 01:06.025
What?

01:06.025 --> 01:09.028
I wonder what toilet paper

01:06.025 --> 01:09.028
was like in the 1860s.

01:09.028 --> 01:10.738
Did they--?

01:09.028 --> 01:10.738
Did they carry it

01:10.738 --> 01:12.322
in rolls

01:10.738 --> 01:12.322
in their duffel bags?

01:12.322 --> 01:15.576
Everything with you

01:12.322 --> 01:15.576
comes down to toilet paper.

01:15.576 --> 01:16.994
What?

01:16.994 --> 01:19.204
That's always

01:16.994 --> 01:19.204
the first question with you.

01:19.204 --> 01:20.581
Why is that

01:19.204 --> 01:20.581
always your focus?

01:20.581 --> 01:22.499
All right, then,

01:20.581 --> 01:22.499
what did they do?

01:22.499 --> 01:23.667
I don't know.

01:23.667 --> 01:25.084
Maybe they gave out

01:23.667 --> 01:25.084
big loose clumps

01:25.084 --> 01:26.294
to all the soldiers.

01:26.294 --> 01:28.047
Well, I think

01:26.294 --> 01:28.047
it would be nice

01:28.047 --> 01:30.549
if there was some sort

01:28.047 --> 01:30.549
of historical record of it.

01:30.549 --> 01:32.384
Maybe they should have

01:30.549 --> 01:32.384
a toilet paper museum.

01:32.384 --> 01:33.552
Would you like that?

01:33.552 --> 01:34.845
So we could see

01:34.845 --> 01:36.513
all the toilet paper

01:34.845 --> 01:36.513
advancements

01:36.513 --> 01:37.681
down through the ages:

01:37.681 --> 01:39.349
toilet paper

01:37.681 --> 01:39.349
during the Crusades,

01:39.349 --> 01:41.226
the development

01:39.349 --> 01:41.226
of the perforation,

01:41.226 --> 01:42.519
the first six-pack.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.939
Excuse me, Jerry?

01:44.939 --> 01:47.482
I'm Stu Shirmack.

01:44.939 --> 01:47.482
I'm from NBC.

01:47.482 --> 01:48.776
Oh.

01:48.776 --> 01:50.318
Could we speak

01:48.776 --> 01:50.318
for a few moments?

01:50.318 --> 01:51.278
Sure. Sure.

01:51.278 --> 01:52.320
Hi. Jay Crespi.

01:52.320 --> 01:53.280
Hello.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.449
Uh, C-R-E-S-P-I.

01:55.449 --> 01:56.784
That's right.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.535
I'm unbelievable

01:56.784 --> 01:58.535
at spelling last names.

01:58.535 --> 01:59.620
Gimme a last name.

01:59.620 --> 02:00.788
Uh, I'm not

01:59.620 --> 02:00.788
really--

02:00.788 --> 02:03.373
George...huh?

02:03.373 --> 02:05.333
[QUIETLY]

02:03.373 --> 02:05.333
All right. Fine.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.837
First of all,

02:08.837 --> 02:11.381
that was a terrific show.

02:11.381 --> 02:12.925
Oh, thank you very much.

02:12.925 --> 02:14.718
And basically I just

02:12.925 --> 02:14.718
wanted to let you know

02:14.718 --> 02:16.219
that we've been

02:14.718 --> 02:16.219
discussing you

02:16.219 --> 02:17.638
at some

02:16.219 --> 02:17.638
of our meetings,

02:17.638 --> 02:20.557
and we'd be very interested

02:17.638 --> 02:20.557
in doing something.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.225
Really? Wow!

02:22.225 --> 02:24.061
So if you had an idea

02:22.225 --> 02:24.061
for, like, uh,

02:24.061 --> 02:25.938
a TV show

02:24.061 --> 02:25.938
for yourself...

02:25.938 --> 02:27.731
Well, we'd just love

02:25.938 --> 02:27.731
to talk about it.

02:27.731 --> 02:30.275
I'd be very interested

02:27.731 --> 02:30.275
in something like that.

02:30.275 --> 02:31.986
Well, here.

02:31.986 --> 02:34.237
Why don't you

02:31.986 --> 02:34.237
give us a call,

02:34.237 --> 02:35.948
and maybe we can,

02:34.237 --> 02:35.948
uh, develop a series?

02:35.948 --> 02:38.033
Okay. Great. Thanks.

02:38.033 --> 02:40.368
It was very nice meeting you.

02:38.033 --> 02:40.368
Thank you.

02:40.368 --> 02:42.997
Nice meeting you.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.041
What was that

02:44.164 --> 02:46.041
all about?

02:46.041 --> 02:47.709
They said they were

02:46.041 --> 02:47.709
interested in me.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.086
For what?

02:49.086 --> 02:50.712
You know, a TV show.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.255
Your own show?

02:52.255 --> 02:54.215
Yeah, I guess so.

02:54.215 --> 02:55.342
[SCOFFS]

02:55.342 --> 02:57.552
They want you

02:55.342 --> 02:57.552
to do a TV show?

02:57.552 --> 02:59.638
They want me

02:57.552 --> 02:59.638
to come up with an idea.

02:59.638 --> 03:01.180
I mean,

02:59.638 --> 03:01.180
I don't have any ideas.

03:01.180 --> 03:03.017
Come on.

03:01.180 --> 03:03.017
How hard is that?

03:03.017 --> 03:05.853
Look at all the junk

03:03.017 --> 03:05.853
that's on TV.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.896
You want an idea?

03:05.853 --> 03:07.896
Here's an idea.

03:07.896 --> 03:10.149
You coach a gymnastics team

03:07.896 --> 03:10.149
in high school,

03:10.149 --> 03:11.566
and you're married,

03:11.566 --> 03:13.986
and your son is not interested

03:11.566 --> 03:13.986
in gymnastics,

03:13.986 --> 03:16.279
and you're pushing him

03:13.986 --> 03:16.279
into gymnastics.

03:16.279 --> 03:18.281
Why should I care

03:16.279 --> 03:18.281
if my son's into gymnastics?

03:18.281 --> 03:19.700
'Cause you're

03:18.281 --> 03:19.700
the gymnastics teacher.

03:19.700 --> 03:20.951
It's only natural.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.577
But gymnastics

03:20.951 --> 03:22.577
is not for everybody.

03:22.577 --> 03:23.996
I know, but he's your son!

03:23.996 --> 03:26.247
So what?

03:27.875 --> 03:29.626
All right,

03:27.875 --> 03:29.626
forget that idea.

03:29.626 --> 03:32.379
It's not for you.

03:32.379 --> 03:34.715
Okay, okay, okay.

03:32.379 --> 03:34.715
I got it.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.800
You run an antique store.

03:36.800 --> 03:37.968
Yeah? And?

03:37.968 --> 03:39.511
And people come

03:37.968 --> 03:39.511
into the store,

03:39.511 --> 03:42.263
and you get involved

03:39.511 --> 03:42.263
in their lives.

03:42.263 --> 03:44.432
What person

03:42.263 --> 03:44.432
who runs an antique store

03:44.432 --> 03:46.143
gets involved

03:44.432 --> 03:46.143
in peoples lives?

03:46.143 --> 03:47.644
Why not?

03:47.644 --> 03:49.563
So someone comes in

03:47.644 --> 03:49.563
to buy an old lamp,

03:49.563 --> 03:51.899
and suddenly I'm getting them

03:49.563 --> 03:51.899
out of a jam?

03:53.441 --> 03:55.485
I could see

03:53.441 --> 03:55.485
if I was a pharmacist,

03:55.485 --> 03:56.820
'cause a pharmacist knows

03:56.820 --> 03:58.321
what's wrong with everybody

03:56.820 --> 03:58.321
that comes in.

03:58.321 --> 04:00.323
I know, but antiques

03:58.321 --> 04:00.323
are very popular now.

04:00.323 --> 04:02.242
No, they're not.

04:00.323 --> 04:02.242
They used to be.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.786
Oh, sure. Like you know.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.786
Oh, like you do?

04:08.082 --> 04:10.209
And you're the manager

04:08.082 --> 04:10.209
of the circus.

04:10.209 --> 04:11.376
A circus?

04:11.376 --> 04:13.879
Oh, come on!

04:11.376 --> 04:13.879
This is a great idea.

04:13.879 --> 04:15.422
I mean, look at

04:13.879 --> 04:15.422
the characters.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.174
You got these freaks

04:15.422 --> 04:17.174
in the show.

04:17.174 --> 04:18.508
A woman with a mustache.

04:18.508 --> 04:19.676
I mean,

04:18.508 --> 04:19.676
who wouldn't tune in

04:19.676 --> 04:21.511
to see a woman

04:19.676 --> 04:21.511
with a mustache?

04:21.511 --> 04:23.346
You got the tallest man

04:21.511 --> 04:23.346
in the world.

04:23.346 --> 04:24.639
A guy who's just a head.

04:24.639 --> 04:26.058
"Hee hee,

04:24.639 --> 04:26.058
ha, fleggy."

04:26.725 --> 04:28.060
I don't think so.

04:28.060 --> 04:30.270
Look, Jerry, the show

04:28.060 --> 04:30.270
isn't about the circus.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.688
It's about

04:30.270 --> 04:31.688
watching freaks.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.356
I don't think the network

04:31.688 --> 04:33.356
would go for it.

04:33.356 --> 04:34.691
Why not?

04:34.691 --> 04:36.526
Look, I'm not pitching

04:34.691 --> 04:36.526
a show about freaks.

04:36.526 --> 04:37.986
Oh, come on, Jerry!

04:36.526 --> 04:37.986
You're wrong.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.613
People, they wanna

04:37.986 --> 04:39.613
watch freaks.

04:39.613 --> 04:40.864
This is a "can't miss"!

04:40.864 --> 04:41.823
Kramer.

04:41.823 --> 04:44.034
[FLATLY]

04:41.823 --> 04:44.034
Hello, Newman.

04:44.034 --> 04:45.786
Come on, let's go.

04:44.034 --> 04:45.786
I got the helmet.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.287
Go get

04:45.786 --> 04:47.287
the radar detector.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.289
Okay. Okay, all right.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.289
I'll be back in a second.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.582
Hey, you guys coming

04:49.289 --> 04:50.582
to my party?

04:50.582 --> 04:52.167
Yeah.

04:50.582 --> 04:52.167
Sure.

04:50.582 --> 04:52.167
Yeah!

04:53.961 --> 04:55.336
What's this

04:53.961 --> 04:55.336
all about?

04:55.336 --> 04:56.463
We're making a trade.

04:56.463 --> 04:57.714
I'm giving him

04:56.463 --> 04:57.714
my motorcycle helmet,

04:57.714 --> 04:59.466
he's giving me

04:57.714 --> 04:59.466
his radar detector.

04:59.466 --> 05:00.968
I didn't know

04:59.466 --> 05:00.968
you have a motorcycle.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.719
Well, my girlfriend had one.

05:02.719 --> 05:04.429
You have a girlfriend?

05:04.429 --> 05:07.057
I had a girlfriend.

05:07.057 --> 05:09.226
And she was pretty wild.

05:09.226 --> 05:12.187
I don't remember you

05:09.226 --> 05:12.187
with a girl.

05:12.187 --> 05:14.148
Nevertheless.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.525
This is a pretty bad deal

05:15.690 --> 05:17.525
for Kramer.

05:17.525 --> 05:18.944
You know,

05:17.525 --> 05:18.944
a radar detector's

05:18.944 --> 05:20.361
worth much more

05:18.944 --> 05:20.361
than that helmet.

That's a renege.

Oh, stop saying

05:35.294 --> 05:36.670
"reneging."

06:19.796 --> 06:23.217
condiment in America.

06:23.217 --> 06:24.467
Do you know why?

06:24.467 --> 06:26.553
Because people like to say

06:24.467 --> 06:26.553
"salsa."

06:28.387 --> 06:30.140
"Excuse me,

06:28.387 --> 06:30.140

06:30.140 --> 06:31.183
"We need more salsa."

06:31.183 --> 06:32.726
"Where's the salsa? No salsa?"

06:32.726 --> 06:35.812
You know, it must be impossible

06:32.726 --> 06:35.812

06:35.812 --> 06:38.397

06:42.401 --> 06:44.571
between selsa and salsa?"

06:44.571 --> 06:47.199

Well, what's the show about?

07:04.507 --> 07:06.551
It's about nothing.

07:08.053 --> 07:10.805
No story?

07:08.053 --> 07:10.805
No, forget the story.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.266
You gotta have a story.

Who says you gotta

07:12.266 --> 07:14.351

07:14.351 --> 07:15.936

07:15.936 --> 07:17.812

07:17.812 --> 07:19.147
That could be a TV show.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.693
And who's on the show?

07:20.941 --> 07:23.693
Who are the characters?

07:23.693 --> 07:25.320
I could be a character.

07:25.320 --> 07:26.487
You?

07:26.487 --> 07:28.073
Yeah, you base a character

07:26.487 --> 07:28.073
on me.

07:28.073 --> 07:29.449
So on the show,

07:29.449 --> 07:31.618
there's a character

07:29.449 --> 07:31.618
named George Costanza?

07:31.618 --> 07:32.911
Yeah.

07:34.204 --> 07:35.247

"You know,

07:36.957 --> 07:39.542
you're quite a character."

07:39.542 --> 07:41.669
And who else is on the show?

07:41.669 --> 07:43.297
Elaine could be a character.

07:43.297 --> 07:44.547
Kramer.

07:44.547 --> 07:47.384
Now, he's a character.

07:44.547 --> 07:47.384
[LAUGHS] Yeah.

07:47.384 --> 07:50.095
So everybody I know

07:47.384 --> 07:50.095
is a character on the show.

07:50.095 --> 07:51.054
Right.

And it's about nothing.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.890
Absolutely nothing.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.976
So you're saying I go into NBC

07:55.976 --> 07:57.560
and tell them

07:55.976 --> 07:57.560
I got this idea

07:57.560 --> 07:58.895
for a show about nothing.

08:03.191 --> 08:05.819
We're talking about a sitcom.

08:08.238 --> 08:10.073
You want to go with me to NBC?

08:10.073 --> 08:11.908
Yeah, I think we really

08:10.073 --> 08:11.908

08:11.908 --> 08:13.243
What do we got?

08:11.908 --> 08:13.243
An idea.

08:13.243 --> 08:15.329
What idea?

08:13.243 --> 08:15.329
An idea for the show.

08:15.329 --> 08:17.456
I still don't know

08:15.329 --> 08:17.456
what the idea is.

08:17.456 --> 08:19.249
It's about nothing.

Right.

Everybody's

doing something.

08:21.418 --> 08:22.877
We'll do nothing.

So we go

08:22.877 --> 08:24.671
into NBC,

08:24.671 --> 08:26.881
we tell them we got an idea

08:24.671 --> 08:26.881
for a show about nothing.

"What's your show about?"

08:28.342 --> 08:29.884
I say, "Nothing."

and one of the characters

08:38.268 --> 08:41.646

No. I don't think so.

I was driving home

09:26.274 --> 09:29.861

09:29.861 --> 09:32.364
and what did I see? The fuzz.

09:32.364 --> 09:33.490
And it's funny,

09:33.490 --> 09:36.326
because my new

09:33.490 --> 09:36.326
radar detector was on,

09:36.326 --> 09:38.537

09:36.326 --> 09:38.537

Yeah, that's strange.

Because

09:41.581 --> 09:43.083

36:49.332 --> 36:51.501
Mr. Seinfeld,

36:49.332 --> 36:51.501
you have a telephone call.

36:51.501 --> 36:52.794
Phone call?

36:52.794 --> 36:54.379
Who knows I'm here?

36:56.422 --> 36:57.841
Hello.

36:57.841 --> 36:59.968
Mom?

36:59.968 --> 37:01.803
How did you know I was here?

37:01.803 --> 37:07.934
Oh, I was not rude to him!

37:01.803 --> 37:07.934
That is baloney.

37:07.934 --> 37:11.855
I couldn't talk.

37:07.934 --> 37:11.855
I had a meeting.

37:11.855 --> 37:13.481
I don't know.

37:13.481 --> 37:16.693
He went off

37:13.481 --> 37:16.693
on some thing about pajamas.

37:16.693 --> 37:19.196
When you sent me the bill

37:16.693 --> 37:19.196
for the dry-cleaning,

37:19.196 --> 37:20.655
I thought the show

37:19.196 --> 37:20.655
didn't have a chance.

37:20.655 --> 37:24.034
Oh, it was only vomit.

37:24.034 --> 37:25.535
Anyway, I--

37:24.034 --> 37:25.535
I would like to,

37:25.535 --> 37:27.079
uh, to pay for

37:25.535 --> 37:27.079
the dry-cleaning.

37:27.079 --> 37:29.330
Oh, no, no. It's okay.

37:27.079 --> 37:29.330
Oh, no, no, no, no.

37:29.330 --> 37:31.083
We all chipped in.

37:29.330 --> 37:31.083
We have the money.

37:31.083 --> 37:34.920
Well...

37:31.083 --> 37:34.920
Well, it was $18.

37:34.920 --> 37:38.297
Okay, $18, and, uh...

37:38.297 --> 37:40.759
There it is, there you go.

37:38.297 --> 37:40.759
All right.

37:40.759 --> 37:43.011
So, uh, maybe we could

37:40.759 --> 37:43.011
get together this weekend.

37:43.011 --> 37:44.345
Yeah. Call me.

37:44.345 --> 37:46.389
All right. Great.

37:44.345 --> 37:46.389
Bye.

37:46.389 --> 37:48.683
Bye. Thanks.

37:46.389 --> 37:48.683
Bye.

37:48.683 --> 37:51.770
I can't believe

37:48.683 --> 37:51.770
she took the money.

37:53.563 --> 37:55.440
Why?

37:55.440 --> 37:57.567
I offered to pay.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.567
She should've said no.

37:57.567 --> 37:59.736
She did. You insisted.

37:59.736 --> 38:01.780
Maybe this is what

37:59.736 --> 38:01.780
the pilot should be about:

38:01.780 --> 38:03.115
vomiting on somebody's vest.

38:03.115 --> 38:04.532
Nah.

38:04.532 --> 38:06.868
How much are we gonna get

38:04.532 --> 38:06.868
for this, 50, 60,000?

38:06.868 --> 38:08.286
Oh, I-- I don't know.

38:08.286 --> 38:10.247
We gotta get 50. All right,

38:08.286 --> 38:10.247
I'll tell you what.

38:10.247 --> 38:11.623
We'll go to the coffee shop.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.166
You call your manager.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.166
Maybe they made an offer.

38:13.166 --> 38:14.709
Okay.

38:13.166 --> 38:14.709
All right, let's go, let's go.

38:16.044 --> 38:18.004
Thirteen thousand?

38:18.004 --> 38:19.672
Thirteen thousand.

38:19.672 --> 38:20.673
Apiece?

38:20.673 --> 38:21.883
No, for both.

38:21.883 --> 38:23.218
That's insulting!

38:23.218 --> 38:26.096
Ted Danson makes $800,000

38:23.218 --> 38:26.096
an episode!

38:26.096 --> 38:28.056
Oh, would you stop

38:26.096 --> 38:28.056
with the Ted Danson?

38:28.056 --> 38:29.057
Well, he does.

38:29.057 --> 38:30.433
You're nuts.

38:29.057 --> 38:30.433
I'm sorry.

38:30.433 --> 38:31.893
I can't live knowing

38:31.893 --> 38:33.561
that Ted Danson makes

38:31.893 --> 38:33.561
that much more than me.

38:33.561 --> 38:34.646
Who's he?

38:34.646 --> 38:35.688
He's somebody.

38:35.688 --> 38:36.898
What about me?

38:35.688 --> 38:36.898
You're nobody.

38:36.898 --> 38:38.108
Why him? Why not me?

38:38.108 --> 38:39.234
He's good. You're not.

38:39.234 --> 38:40.277
I'm better than him.

38:40.277 --> 38:42.154
You're worse.

38:42.154 --> 38:44.363
Much, much worse.

38:45.782 --> 38:46.741
There's Davola.

38:46.741 --> 38:47.993
What? Where?

38:46.741 --> 38:47.993
Where?

38:47.993 --> 38:51.037
Outside, I just

38:47.993 --> 38:51.037
saw him outside.

38:56.459 --> 38:58.003
What is it?

38:58.003 --> 39:01.756
Oh, it's this patient.

39:01.756 --> 39:03.382
Again?

39:03.382 --> 39:05.468
I'm fairly certain

39:05.468 --> 39:06.845
I forgot to leave him

39:06.845 --> 39:08.930
an extra prescription

39:06.845 --> 39:08.930
for his medication.

39:08.930 --> 39:11.432
Well, so, he can live

39:08.930 --> 39:11.432
without his Valium

39:11.432 --> 39:12.809
for a couple of days.

39:12.809 --> 39:15.353
No, you don't understand.

39:15.353 --> 39:18.731
He could be dangerous.

39:20.650 --> 39:22.777
Go outside

39:20.650 --> 39:22.777
and see if he's there.

39:22.777 --> 39:24.904
I can't go out there.

39:22.777 --> 39:24.904
He knows we're friends.

39:24.904 --> 39:26.405
What am I supposed to do?

39:26.405 --> 39:29.284
I gotta take Kramer

39:26.405 --> 39:29.284
to the doctor.

39:29.284 --> 39:30.869
Tell the cop.

39:30.869 --> 39:32.453
Good idea.

39:36.624 --> 39:38.751
Excuse me, officer.

39:38.751 --> 39:40.962
There's a guy outside,

39:38.751 --> 39:40.962
and he's kind of a nut job,

39:40.962 --> 39:42.755
and I think he's waiting

39:40.962 --> 39:42.755
to beat me up.

39:42.755 --> 39:44.132
If you could just

39:42.755 --> 39:44.132
walk me outside

39:44.132 --> 39:45.842
and wait till

39:44.132 --> 39:45.842
I get into a cab...

39:45.842 --> 39:47.385
Yeah, all right.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.137
Uh, just--

39:47.385 --> 39:49.137
Just let me get a muffin.

39:49.137 --> 39:51.223
Thanks.

39:53.141 --> 39:54.433
Well...

39:56.435 --> 39:59.564
He's gonna get a muffin,

39:56.435 --> 39:59.564
then he'll walk us outside.

39:59.564 --> 40:02.275
This is a great way

39:59.564 --> 40:02.275
to go through life, isn't it?

40:02.275 --> 40:05.528
Hey, he's looking

40:02.275 --> 40:05.528
at the menu now.

40:05.528 --> 40:08.740
What's he looking at

40:05.528 --> 40:08.740
the menu for?

40:08.740 --> 40:11.243
I thought you said

40:08.740 --> 40:11.243
he was gonna get a muffin.

40:18.499 --> 40:21.336
What are you doing?

40:21.336 --> 40:22.461
What?

40:22.461 --> 40:24.589
What, are you

40:22.461 --> 40:24.589
ordering food now?

40:24.589 --> 40:25.673
Yeah.

40:25.673 --> 40:27.092
Yeah, I decided

40:25.673 --> 40:27.092
to get a sandwich.

40:27.092 --> 40:28.760
What happened

40:27.092 --> 40:28.760
to the muffin?

40:28.760 --> 40:30.428
I got a little hungry.

40:30.428 --> 40:32.638
All of a sudden

40:30.428 --> 40:32.638
you get hungry?

40:32.638 --> 40:35.350
Yeah.

40:32.638 --> 40:35.350
You got a problem with that?

40:35.350 --> 40:36.517
No.

40:36.517 --> 40:39.604
Enjoy your lunch.

40:41.981 --> 40:44.609
You know, a muffin

40:41.981 --> 40:44.609
can be very filling.

40:49.364 --> 40:51.824
He's getting a sandwich now.

40:51.824 --> 40:53.701
I thought he was just

40:51.824 --> 40:53.701
gonna have a muffin.

40:53.701 --> 40:55.954
All of a sudden,

40:53.701 --> 40:55.954
he gets hungry.

40:55.954 --> 40:57.663
You know, a muffin

40:55.954 --> 40:57.663
can be very filling.

40:57.663 --> 40:59.749
I know!

41:01.918 --> 41:04.337
Mr. Kramer.

41:04.337 --> 41:06.005
You heard the testimony

41:04.337 --> 41:06.005
so far.

41:06.005 --> 41:08.967
Would you please tell

41:06.005 --> 41:08.967
the court in your own words

41:08.967 --> 41:12.304
what happened on the afternoon

41:08.967 --> 41:12.304
of September 10th?

41:12.304 --> 41:14.889
What do you mean,

41:12.304 --> 41:14.889
"in my own words"?

41:14.889 --> 41:16.599
Whose words are they gonna be?

41:16.599 --> 41:19.060
You know what I mean.

41:19.060 --> 41:20.937
I was very upset that day.

41:20.937 --> 41:22.355
And why was that?

41:22.355 --> 41:24.357
Would you let me say--?

41:22.355 --> 41:24.357
Let me talk.

41:24.357 --> 41:26.359
All right, all right.

41:24.357 --> 41:26.359
Go ahead, go ahead.

41:26.359 --> 41:27.652
All right.

41:26.359 --> 41:27.652
Okay.

41:29.446 --> 41:31.072
I was very upset

41:29.446 --> 41:31.072
that day

41:31.072 --> 41:32.907
because I could never

41:31.072 --> 41:32.907
become a banker.

41:32.907 --> 41:37.454
And this failure

41:32.907 --> 41:37.454
to become a banker...

41:37.454 --> 41:38.913
It was eating at you.

41:38.913 --> 41:41.082
Eating, eating,

41:38.913 --> 41:41.082
eating at you inside.

41:41.082 --> 41:43.668
Uh, yeah.

41:45.086 --> 41:47.546
It was your family

41:45.086 --> 41:47.546
that pushed you into banking.

41:47.546 --> 41:49.882
It was their dream for you.

41:47.546 --> 41:49.882
Mr. Newman.

41:49.882 --> 41:51.759
Your Honor, I'm only

41:49.882 --> 41:51.759
trying to establish

41:51.759 --> 41:53.136
Mr. Kramer's

41:51.759 --> 41:53.136
fragile emotional state.

41:53.136 --> 41:54.595
My entire case depends on it.

41:54.595 --> 41:57.307
Uh...continue.

41:57.307 --> 41:58.850
As you were saying, Mr. Kramer?

41:58.850 --> 42:00.435
What was the question?

42:00.435 --> 42:02.145
You're telling how your parents

42:00.435 --> 42:02.145
pushed you into banking.

42:02.145 --> 42:03.771
Right.

42:03.771 --> 42:05.815
Well, my father,

42:03.771 --> 42:05.815
when I was a kid,

42:05.815 --> 42:09.277
he took me to the bank.

42:05.815 --> 42:09.277
And he lifted me up.

42:09.277 --> 42:10.945
And he pointed

42:09.277 --> 42:10.945
to the teller

42:10.945 --> 42:13.656
and he said, "Sonny boy,

42:10.945 --> 42:13.656
take a good look at him.

42:13.656 --> 42:16.075
<i>That's</i> gonna

42:13.656 --> 42:16.075
be you someday."

42:16.075 --> 42:21.414
But you never became a banker,

42:16.075 --> 42:21.414
did you, Mr. Kramer?

42:21.414 --> 42:22.707
Why?

42:22.707 --> 42:24.542
Why did you fail?

42:24.542 --> 42:26.169
I don't know.

42:26.169 --> 42:28.629
It was because

42:26.169 --> 42:28.629
you hated your father,

42:28.629 --> 42:30.673
and you would do anything

42:28.629 --> 42:30.673
to displease him.

42:30.673 --> 42:32.384
Isn't<i> that</i> true?

42:32.384 --> 42:34.386
Uh, could you

42:32.384 --> 42:34.386
get to the speeding?

42:34.386 --> 42:35.970
Yes, I intend to,

42:34.386 --> 42:35.970
Your Honor.

42:35.970 --> 42:37.180
And then,

42:37.180 --> 42:39.182
on the afternoon

42:37.180 --> 42:39.182
of September 10th,

42:39.182 --> 42:40.683
you received

42:39.182 --> 42:40.683
a phone call,

42:40.683 --> 42:41.893
did you not?

42:41.893 --> 42:43.561
Phone call?

42:44.854 --> 42:47.690
Yes, a phone call.

42:47.690 --> 42:49.275
From who?

42:49.275 --> 42:51.486
From me.

42:49.275 --> 42:51.486
From you?

42:51.486 --> 42:54.322
Yes! From me. From me!

42:51.486 --> 42:54.322
I called you, remember?

42:54.322 --> 42:55.407
You called me?

42:55.407 --> 42:57.325
Yes, I called you,

42:55.407 --> 42:57.325
you idiot!

42:57.325 --> 42:58.743
Because you were going to...

42:58.743 --> 43:00.203
You were going to...

42:58.743 --> 43:00.203
Remember?

43:00.203 --> 43:01.329
What?

43:00.203 --> 43:01.329
You were gonna--

43:01.329 --> 43:02.788
You were gonna

43:01.329 --> 43:02.788
ack-ka-ka-ka!

43:02.788 --> 43:04.207
Gonna do something!

43:04.207 --> 43:05.666
You were dai-ya deh,

43:04.207 --> 43:05.666
wha-hey!

43:05.666 --> 43:07.043
To yourself!

43:07.043 --> 43:08.336
You were gonna do

43:07.043 --> 43:08.336
something to yourself!

43:08.336 --> 43:09.628
Remember, the banking?

43:08.336 --> 43:09.628
The banking!

43:09.628 --> 43:10.963
Wha--! Ha! Hoo!

43:09.628 --> 43:10.963
Forget the banking!

43:10.963 --> 43:12.840
I'm afraid I'm gonna

43:10.963 --> 43:12.840
have to call--

43:12.840 --> 43:14.509
Yes, a banker!

43:12.840 --> 43:14.509
What banker?

43:14.509 --> 43:15.927
A banker! A banker!

43:15.927 --> 43:18.179
Your Honor, Your Honor,

43:15.927 --> 43:18.179
Your Honor...

43:18.179 --> 43:19.680
That's enough, Mr.--

43:19.680 --> 43:21.099
Your Honor, Mr. Kramer

43:19.680 --> 43:21.099
is obviously distraught.

43:21.099 --> 43:22.392
I'm distraught?

43:22.392 --> 43:25.019
You shut up!

43:22.392 --> 43:25.019
Woo, woo, woo, woo!

43:25.019 --> 43:26.521
[PANTING]

43:26.521 --> 43:29.107
I demand a recess

43:26.521 --> 43:29.107
so that I can take him outside

43:29.107 --> 43:30.900
and help him

43:29.107 --> 43:30.900
regain his composure!

43:30.900 --> 43:33.027
That'll be $75.

43:33.027 --> 43:34.904
What's the matter

43:33.027 --> 43:34.904
with you, you jerk?

43:34.904 --> 43:36.573
We had it all worked out.

43:42.078 --> 43:43.788
Is he out there?

43:42.078 --> 43:43.788
Do you see him?

43:43.788 --> 43:45.498
I'm not sure.

43:45.498 --> 43:48.126
Well, either you see him

43:45.498 --> 43:48.126
or you don't.

43:49.377 --> 43:51.463
All right. I don't.

43:53.256 --> 43:54.882
What is he doing?

43:54.882 --> 43:57.927
Is he getting coffee?

43:57.927 --> 44:01.389
I think he's getting coffee.

44:01.389 --> 44:03.724
What's with this guy?

44:06.727 --> 44:08.813
Did you just

44:06.727 --> 44:08.813
order coffee?

44:09.939 --> 44:11.357
Yeah.

44:11.357 --> 44:12.900
This is really too much.

44:12.900 --> 44:15.194
What is your problem?

44:12.900 --> 44:15.194
Well, I'm sitting over there,

44:15.194 --> 44:17.655
waiting for you to finish

44:15.194 --> 44:17.655
your sandwich for 20 minutes.

44:17.655 --> 44:18.948
Now you're drinking coffee.

44:18.948 --> 44:20.325
That's gonna be

44:18.948 --> 44:20.325
another 10 minutes.

44:20.325 --> 44:23.953
Well, you're just

44:20.325 --> 44:23.953
gonna have to wait.

44:23.953 --> 44:26.080
You never said anything

44:23.953 --> 44:26.080
about the banking.

44:26.080 --> 44:27.415
You're off your rocker.

44:27.415 --> 44:28.458
Hey, you guys!

44:28.458 --> 44:29.917
Hey.

44:28.458 --> 44:29.917
What're you

44:28.458 --> 44:29.917
doing here?

44:29.917 --> 44:30.960
What're you doing here?

44:30.960 --> 44:32.044
Hey, is Davola outside?

44:32.044 --> 44:33.505
Davola?

44:32.044 --> 44:33.505
Yeah.

44:33.505 --> 44:34.589
No, I didn't see him.

44:34.589 --> 44:35.590
Crazy Joe Davola?

44:35.590 --> 44:36.882
Jerry, yours is $11.

44:36.882 --> 44:38.343
Eleven dollars, for what?

44:38.343 --> 44:40.052
Muffin, sandwich and coffee.

44:41.554 --> 44:44.223
NBC okayed our idea.

44:41.554 --> 44:44.223
We're gonna make the pilot.

44:44.223 --> 44:45.850
You're gonna do

44:44.223 --> 44:45.850
the circus-freak show, huh?

44:45.850 --> 44:47.143
No.

44:47.143 --> 44:48.478
A pilot!

44:48.478 --> 44:49.979
So, what do you make

44:48.478 --> 44:49.979
for something like that,

44:49.979 --> 44:50.980
50, 60,000?

44:50.980 --> 44:52.357
What's the difference?

44:52.357 --> 44:54.150
The money's

44:52.357 --> 44:54.150
not important.

44:55.776 --> 44:57.236
Hey, Newman,

44:55.776 --> 44:57.236
is that your red car?

44:57.236 --> 44:58.279
Yeah.

44:58.279 --> 44:59.322
I think you're getting

44:58.279 --> 44:59.322
a ticket.

44:59.322 --> 45:00.615
Go. Run. Run.

44:59.322 --> 45:00.615
Go! Go! Go!

45:00.615 --> 45:01.824
NEWMAN:

45:00.615 --> 45:01.824
Hey, what

45:00.615 --> 45:01.824
are you doing?

45:01.824 --> 45:03.075
It's after 6:00!

45:03.075 --> 45:04.743
You can't give me

45:03.075 --> 45:04.743
a ticket.

45:04.743 --> 45:06.496
Hey, you're not gonna

45:04.743 --> 45:06.496
get away with this.

45:06.496 --> 45:08.373
I'll fight this!

45:06.496 --> 45:08.373
I've got witnesses.

45:08.373 --> 45:09.915
I saw the whole thing!

45:09.915 --> 45:11.042
I think this whole thing

45:11.042 --> 45:12.627
would be a good idea

45:11.042 --> 45:12.627
for the pilot.

45:12.627 --> 45:14.379
Ah, get out of here.

45:12.627 --> 45:14.379
The vomiting is much funnier.

45:14.379 --> 45:16.381
Oh, like you know

45:14.379 --> 45:16.381
what you're talking about.

45:16.381 --> 45:17.507
No. You do.

45:17.507 --> 45:19.050
Many states in the country

45:19.050 --> 45:20.968
now have traffic school

45:19.050 --> 45:20.968
when you have an infraction.

45:20.968 --> 45:22.887
I went to traffic school.

45:20.968 --> 45:22.887
I didn't mind it.

45:22.887 --> 45:24.138
I kind of felt bad

45:24.138 --> 45:25.557
for the traffic school

45:24.138 --> 45:25.557
instructor.

45:25.557 --> 45:26.891
This guy goes to traffic school

45:25.557 --> 45:26.891
every day,

45:26.891 --> 45:29.060
no matter how he drives.

45:29.060 --> 45:31.521
What is his incentive

45:29.060 --> 45:31.521
to not speed?

45:31.521 --> 45:34.773
He's going to traffic school

45:31.521 --> 45:34.773
anyway.

45:34.773 --> 45:36.108
Why not get a race car,

45:36.108 --> 45:37.734
do 200 miles an hour

45:36.108 --> 45:37.734
down the street?

45:37.734 --> 45:39.070
Cop stops you.

45:37.734 --> 45:39.070
"Where're you going?"

45:39.070 --> 45:40.238
"Traffic school."

45:40.238 --> 45:42.156
"Go ahead.

45:40.238 --> 45:42.156
And you better hurry.

45:42.156 --> 45:43.533
You really need it."

45:43.533 --> 45:45.493
Maybe the punishment should be,

45:45.493 --> 45:47.704
instead of traffic school

45:45.493 --> 45:47.704
or traffic court,

45:47.704 --> 45:49.414
just traffic.

45:49.414 --> 45:53.918
They sentence you

45:49.414 --> 45:53.918
to 100 hours of traffic.

45:53.918 --> 45:56.254
They assign, like, five people

45:53.918 --> 45:56.254
to drive all around you

45:56.254 --> 45:58.923
at five miles an hour

45:56.254 --> 45:58.923
wherever you go.

45:58.923 --> 46:01.967
You're on your way to Vegas,

45:58.923 --> 46:01.967
there isn't a car in sight...

46:01.967 --> 46:04.554
"Come on. Move it."

46:13.938 --> 46:17.900
