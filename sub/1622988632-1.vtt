00:54.231 --> 00:56.662
- There's still a yard sale.
- Please don't.

00:56.694 --> 00:57.911
- I don't need...
- Maybe there's something

00:57.943 --> 00:59.574
good in here, I can
already see a table.

00:59.606 --> 01:01.783
- Hey.
- Hey Meg, careful please.

01:01.815 --> 01:03.990
Please
don't touch anything.

01:05.495 --> 01:06.966
Please don't touch anything.

01:09.910 --> 01:10.837
I can touch things.

01:16.534 --> 01:17.175
How's it going?

01:20.855 --> 01:22.871
I don't think
this is a good idea.

01:22.903 --> 01:24.342
I've seen worse.

01:24.374 --> 01:25.655
Besides, it looks
like they're moving.

01:25.687 --> 01:27.639
Bet you their neighbors
are glad about that.

01:32.566 --> 01:34.391
Are you gonna get that, Daddy?

01:34.423 --> 01:37.366
Yeah, I think I can make
it perfect for your room.

01:37.399 --> 01:39.319
Shouldn't take me
too long either.

01:39.351 --> 01:41.847
Oh yes, 'cause you're so
good at woodworking, right?

01:41.879 --> 01:43.126
Well, we might as
well take advantage

01:43.159 --> 01:44.694
of your uncle's old workshop

01:44.727 --> 01:46.679
since we're gonna
be there awhile.

01:51.286 --> 01:53.142
Are you gonna paint it purple?

01:53.174 --> 01:55.543
I'll paint it any
color you like, how about that?

02:02.231 --> 02:04.919
Mommy, look.

02:04.951 --> 02:07.477
Look at these.

02:12.374 --> 02:15.350
I had one like this when
I was a little girl.

02:15.383 --> 02:16.343
His name was Teddy.

02:18.583 --> 02:19.606
Hmm.

02:19.639 --> 02:20.950
Can I hold him?

02:26.295 --> 02:28.983
Your name is Ricky, isn't it?

02:29.015 --> 02:31.670
Not Teddy.

02:35.574 --> 02:36.503
Sorry, how much?

02:39.799 --> 02:42.550
It's a very
special little bear.

02:44.854 --> 02:47.415
Do you want it to be
yours, sweetheart?

02:47.446 --> 02:50.135
We just want to know how
much you want for the bear.

02:54.871 --> 02:56.023
For this little girl,

02:57.751 --> 02:58.583
it's free.

03:03.831 --> 03:07.447
All she has to do is
keep him warm and safe.

03:14.391 --> 03:15.606
He's a family member.

03:19.063 --> 03:20.983
How much you want
for the little table?

04:28.662 --> 04:29.911
K, move aside.

04:29.943 --> 04:30.967
Come on, keep an eye on Meg.

04:30.999 --> 04:32.341
I'll see what I can do.

04:33.334 --> 04:35.350
Yes, almighty Tetris queen.

04:36.246 --> 04:38.327
Look, I
can get this in here,

04:38.358 --> 04:41.367
but do we seriously
need this piece of crap?

04:41.399 --> 04:43.127
The house is crowded
enough as is with

04:43.158 --> 04:45.047
all of Uncle Eli's stuff.

04:45.078 --> 04:45.877
Here.

04:47.511 --> 04:48.343
Really, Beth?

04:49.815 --> 04:51.319
I just wanted to
make something that

04:51.351 --> 04:54.007
made our home feel like our own.

04:55.126 --> 04:56.983
Something that
was actually ours.

04:58.614 --> 04:59.671
I know, I'm sorry.

05:00.759 --> 05:02.327
I know I shouldn't
have said anything.

05:05.623 --> 05:08.821
I just know I'm the one who
put us in this situation and

05:09.814 --> 05:12.757
I guess part of recovery is
acknowledging the blame, so.

05:14.807 --> 05:19.063
Look, I'm really grateful
that you stood by me.

05:19.095 --> 05:21.910
And I know how lucky I am to
still have you and Meg and...

05:36.694 --> 05:38.295
All this can make
me feel a little...

05:40.695 --> 05:42.070
Scared and useless.

05:42.103 --> 05:45.397
And when I feel like that, I
lash out and it's shitty of me.

05:46.935 --> 05:47.734
I'm sorry.

05:50.839 --> 05:51.670
I'm sorry too.

05:52.695 --> 05:54.263
- No, it's...
- Beth.

05:56.951 --> 05:59.031
You are one of the
strongest people I know.

06:02.103 --> 06:03.798
And we made it through
the tough times

06:03.831 --> 06:05.206
because I knew you'd get better.

06:06.230 --> 06:07.063
And you did.

06:09.079 --> 06:11.895
Beth, I love you so much.

06:13.783 --> 06:15.191
I am so proud of you.

06:16.054 --> 06:18.102
Please, don't be scared.

06:18.135 --> 06:20.022
I'm not going anywhere.

07:01.335 --> 07:02.774
Meg.

07:02.806 --> 07:03.830
Where is she?

07:03.863 --> 07:05.590
- That girl has no boundaries.
- Yeah, well life will

07:05.623 --> 07:07.574
teach her too many
boundaries soon enough.

07:07.606 --> 07:09.015
Let's not wish that upon her.

07:09.047 --> 07:10.390
I'm not wishing
anything on her.

07:10.423 --> 07:12.343
I'm talking about
keeping her safe.

07:13.207 --> 07:15.735
Hey Meg, it's time
to answer me, please.

07:55.574 --> 07:56.566
- Meg!
- Meg!

07:59.350 --> 08:00.118
Meg, Meg.

08:00.151 --> 08:01.014
Meg, talk to me, Meg.

08:01.047 --> 08:01.942
Meg, what is it?

08:01.974 --> 08:02.838
- What is it?
- Jack!

08:02.871 --> 08:04.246
Meg, did you eat something?

08:04.279 --> 08:05.303
- Meg, come on, look at me.
- Jack, what is that?

08:05.335 --> 08:06.422
Meg, come on, give me
something here, Meg, please.

08:06.455 --> 08:07.126
Help her, help!

08:07.159 --> 08:08.471
Did you eat something?

08:08.502 --> 08:09.878
Come on, give me
something here, Meg.

08:09.910 --> 08:11.415
- Meg, please, Meg.
- Meg!

08:11.447 --> 08:14.102
- What is it? What happened?
- Jack, do something!

11:22.006 --> 11:24.854
I think Meg should
see a new therapist.

11:25.622 --> 11:27.542
I don't feel like Ashe
is helping very much.

11:27.574 --> 11:28.374
Yeah, I agree.

11:29.271 --> 11:31.606
I'm kinda over that
whole worry bully stuff.

11:31.639 --> 11:32.503
I know, right?

11:32.534 --> 11:33.494
And I really want to figure out

11:33.526 --> 11:35.062
what's going on
with her stomach.

11:35.094 --> 11:36.151
I mean, my stomach hurt

11:36.182 --> 11:38.966
all the time as a kid.

11:45.047 --> 11:48.502
I just want her here
with me sometimes.

11:48.534 --> 11:51.030
It's not fair that
you get to decide.

11:53.751 --> 11:54.902
Even when we moved,

11:54.934 --> 11:57.942
Meg didn't complain about her
stomach when you got fired.

11:59.318 --> 12:01.750
I feel like it's a tactic.

12:01.782 --> 12:04.470
I feel like she's trying
to find ways to stay home.

12:05.655 --> 12:06.486
Mm-hmm.

12:07.575 --> 12:09.047
Okay so pretty much
what you're saying

12:09.079 --> 12:10.486
is that it's my fault.

12:16.502 --> 12:17.334
Okay.

12:18.358 --> 12:19.158
Okay.

12:22.071 --> 12:23.350
I don't know,
maybe you're right.

12:24.407 --> 12:25.270
And maybe the timing

12:25.302 --> 12:27.094
of everything is for
the best, she'll...

12:28.662 --> 12:31.095
And I'll be home if
she needs me, right?

12:31.127 --> 12:33.910
Believe me, that's
the last thing we need.

12:33.942 --> 12:35.254
We need to get out

12:35.286 --> 12:36.375
- of this situation.
- Hey, I know.

12:40.374 --> 12:41.206
Mommy.

12:43.607 --> 12:44.982
I mean, come...

12:49.654 --> 12:51.542
Want to just go home?

12:53.558 --> 12:54.390
Yeah?

12:57.047 --> 12:59.510
Yeah, okay.

12:59.542 --> 13:01.270
Okay, babycakes.

13:01.302 --> 13:02.678
Time for bed.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.270
I told you, off your tablet.

13:05.302 --> 13:06.102
Let's go.

13:07.543 --> 13:10.710
Nice try,
but I saw you.

13:15.319 --> 13:16.630
Stop it.

13:18.902 --> 13:20.791
Meg, let go, please.

13:24.502 --> 13:25.302
Thank you.

13:35.254 --> 13:38.327
Did I ever tell you about
the day I met your mommy?

13:42.774 --> 13:47.318
She was about your age and
you look exactly like her.

13:48.662 --> 13:51.703
Well, she was here
visiting her Uncle Eli

13:51.735 --> 13:56.567
and I was in the backyard
pruning my rosebush,

13:57.846 --> 14:00.343
and she would stop
and pretend like

14:00.375 --> 14:02.038
she was looking somewhere else

14:02.071 --> 14:04.215
when I tried to get her eye.

14:05.111 --> 14:08.119
But I knew she wanted to
know what I was doing.

14:08.151 --> 14:12.598
So I finally did catch her
eye and I smiled at her.

14:13.591 --> 14:17.591
And I think that made her
brave enough to come over.

14:18.679 --> 14:21.174
And when she walked up to me,

14:21.942 --> 14:23.926
I handed her a rose.

14:26.678 --> 14:30.486
It was such a beautiful
pale pink rose.

14:31.414 --> 14:35.927
And she looked up at me
with the sweetest smile.

14:38.743 --> 14:42.902
And we've been fast
friends ever since.

14:44.918 --> 14:49.750
And I think that you and
I are fast friends now,

14:50.838 --> 14:53.047
just like me and your mommy.

15:00.823 --> 15:01.719
No, huh?

15:04.054 --> 15:04.695
Okay.

15:08.535 --> 15:10.902
You want me to sing
you a song before I go?

15:12.694 --> 15:13.335
Just go.

15:18.806 --> 15:20.087
Okay.

15:20.119 --> 15:23.222
Night night, don't
let the bed bugs bite.

15:31.062 --> 15:34.359
So I went back and checked
on her just a little while ago

15:34.391 --> 15:38.199
and had to take her tablet
away from her again.

15:38.231 --> 15:40.726
But the
poor little thing,

15:40.758 --> 15:42.039
she's so exhausted.

15:42.071 --> 15:44.342
She's gonna be asleep soon.

15:44.374 --> 15:45.526
You think I should

15:45.558 --> 15:46.294
- check on her or...
- It sounds like

15:46.326 --> 15:47.703
she's calming down.

15:47.735 --> 15:49.687
She needs to get used to
falling asleep without you.

15:49.719 --> 15:52.982
I could tell that
she was a little sad,

15:53.014 --> 15:54.615
so I tried to distract her

15:54.647 --> 15:55.607
and it worked for a little bit.

15:55.639 --> 15:58.359
We danced for awhile.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.854
But then she said that
she had a stomachache

16:00.886 --> 16:03.255
and wanted to be
alone in her room.

16:03.287 --> 16:07.478
I realized I should've taken
the tablet away sooner.

16:07.510 --> 16:08.983
Sorry about that.

16:09.015 --> 16:10.743
That's my fault, I
shouldn't have told her

16:10.775 --> 16:11.863
she could use it.

16:11.895 --> 16:15.126
That's, I don't know, it's
all a little bit new for us.

16:15.158 --> 16:16.663
Hmm.

16:16.695 --> 16:19.575
Hey, we couldn't
do this without you.

16:19.607 --> 16:22.455
You help keep this
family sane.

16:22.487 --> 16:23.894
Oh no, no, no.

16:23.926 --> 16:24.982
- Oh, come on.
- This is on me.

16:25.014 --> 16:26.167
- Nope, it's on me.
- Come on.

16:26.199 --> 16:28.886
I'm happy you guys had
a night out together.

16:28.918 --> 16:30.103
- Thank you, goodnight.
- Thank you, Marissa.

16:30.135 --> 16:31.478
- We really appreciate you.
- You bet.

16:34.935 --> 16:37.238
Sounds
like she's asleep.

16:37.270 --> 16:38.743
It's the little steps, right?

16:40.246 --> 16:42.966
Yeah.

17:13.717 --> 17:16.214
Meg.

18:07.606 --> 18:08.437
Oh, Jesus.

18:09.911 --> 18:11.671
Meg, sweetie.

18:11.703 --> 18:14.487
Hey, you need to go to bed.

18:36.534 --> 18:37.366
Hey.

18:44.566 --> 18:46.071
Hey, are you okay, sweetie?

18:48.247 --> 18:49.079
Meg.

18:51.831 --> 18:53.430
Hey, Meggie, Meg.

18:57.111 --> 19:00.567
Hey, did you have
a bad dream, hmm?

19:00.599 --> 19:01.527
Okay, come on.

19:01.559 --> 19:03.414
It's okay, lay down.

19:03.447 --> 19:04.950
Okay, all right.

19:08.566 --> 19:11.766
Here you go.

19:11.797 --> 19:13.111
Close your eyes.

20:29.847 --> 20:30.678
Mommy.

20:49.654 --> 20:52.246
Jack.

20:55.927 --> 20:58.326
Crap.

21:06.934 --> 21:08.311
- Mommy?
- Ssh, hi.

21:09.430 --> 21:11.159
You don't have to
get up yet, okay?

21:11.191 --> 21:12.023
Don't leave.

21:13.174 --> 21:14.134
I love you.

21:14.167 --> 21:15.702
I'll be right back, okay?

21:15.735 --> 21:18.421
- I love you.
- Okay, go back to sleep.

21:30.135 --> 21:31.127
Jack, she...

21:31.991 --> 21:33.526
She called out, okay?

21:33.559 --> 21:37.270
And then I think she
was sleepwalking or,

21:38.903 --> 21:41.430
I don't know, at least I
think she was sleepwalking.

21:44.727 --> 21:47.767
You seemed okay with me
checking on her before.

21:47.799 --> 21:48.919
Checking on her, I get.

21:48.950 --> 21:50.327
I understand, I just,

21:51.799 --> 21:54.550
when you spend all night
with her, it's just,

21:56.470 --> 21:58.486
I just really miss
having you next to me.

22:00.694 --> 22:01.303
Oh.

22:02.646 --> 22:03.255
Listen.

22:04.791 --> 22:05.847
Just give me a call after
your meeting with Ashe.

22:05.878 --> 22:07.126
And I'll see you later.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.471
Okay, hold on.

22:09.783 --> 22:11.895
Okay, I gave in, I'm sorry.

22:12.919 --> 22:14.743
Okay, I'm sorry too.

22:16.086 --> 22:17.175
Last night I was,

22:18.358 --> 22:19.127
I was a real asshole.

22:19.158 --> 22:21.303
Mm, mm-hmm.

22:22.263 --> 22:23.094
Comes naturally.

22:24.406 --> 22:25.911
Wow.

22:25.943 --> 22:28.054
That's cute.

22:28.087 --> 22:29.943
All right, I'll see you later.

22:29.974 --> 22:32.374
Mm, Jack, here.

22:32.406 --> 22:33.974
Hey, I am trying.

22:34.006 --> 22:35.511
I know you are.

22:35.543 --> 22:36.438
We're both trying.

22:37.558 --> 22:38.614
I'll see you tonight.

22:46.134 --> 22:48.374
Can I just stay
one day with you?

22:48.406 --> 22:50.581
No, sweetie.

22:50.614 --> 22:52.214
We're here to talk
to Mr. Taylor, okay?

22:52.246 --> 22:55.030
And then you need
to go to class.

23:00.919 --> 23:01.719
Meg.

23:04.182 --> 23:06.038
Why don't you want to
be at school today?

23:10.294 --> 23:12.630
Please, just one day?

23:15.031 --> 23:15.831
Meg.

23:16.791 --> 23:17.974
You need to answer me.

23:19.094 --> 23:21.046
I can't help you if
you don't answer me.

23:23.318 --> 23:24.631
Why do you want to go home?

23:27.318 --> 23:28.247
Because.

23:30.358 --> 23:31.479
My tummy hurts.

23:33.430 --> 23:34.806
And sometimes my throat.

23:34.838 --> 23:37.878
Yep, yep, and this is
what is getting worse.

23:41.239 --> 23:43.126
I'm sorry to hear that, Meg.

23:43.159 --> 23:45.847
Can you describe to me again
what the pain feels like?

23:47.542 --> 23:50.743
Feels like I'm
hungry, really hungry.

23:55.606 --> 23:56.534
I'm gonna recommend
that you guys

23:56.566 --> 23:58.871
set up an appointment
with Meg's pediatrician

23:58.902 --> 24:00.439
so we can rule out any digestive

24:00.470 --> 24:02.230
or food sensitivity
issues, of course.

24:02.263 --> 24:04.502
Okay, well we already
have that appointment

24:04.535 --> 24:05.751
set for next week, so.

24:06.999 --> 24:07.831
Good.

24:10.614 --> 24:13.367
But I don't think
that's the case.

24:14.743 --> 24:17.271
You know what I think?

24:17.302 --> 24:18.583
I think it's the worry monster

24:18.614 --> 24:20.407
being a big old bully again.

24:23.031 --> 24:25.974
Meg, do you miss your mom a lot

24:26.007 --> 24:27.223
when you're not with her?

24:28.535 --> 24:29.174
Yes.

24:30.647 --> 24:32.086
Does your
stomach and throat hurt

24:32.119 --> 24:33.398
only when you miss her?

24:34.903 --> 24:35.926
Yes.

24:39.382 --> 24:42.071
That's a mean
old monster, huh?

24:46.423 --> 24:48.247
I want to thank
you for coming in.

24:48.278 --> 24:51.798
I know it's probably uncomfortable
being here right now.

24:51.831 --> 24:53.974
But since you're here,
is there anything extra...

24:54.007 --> 24:54.903
Is Meg okay?

24:55.767 --> 24:56.950
I mean,

24:56.983 --> 25:00.246
I mean, she's so
attached to me now

25:00.278 --> 25:03.255
and she's still so attached
to her bear, Ricky,

25:03.286 --> 25:05.975
and I don't know,
last night I found her

25:06.006 --> 25:08.470
sitting up in bed and she
was staring at nothing

25:08.503 --> 25:09.782
and I just thought...

25:13.974 --> 25:16.023
What? You thought what?

25:17.206 --> 25:18.038
Nothing.

25:21.110 --> 25:23.511
I don't know, it's
just hard for me.

25:24.471 --> 25:27.062
She's so much like I was.

25:27.095 --> 25:29.302
Or I don't know,
like I am now and...

25:32.055 --> 25:33.238
But she wasn't at first, right?

25:33.271 --> 25:35.158
She was fearless and
I just thought that

25:35.191 --> 25:37.751
she wouldn't be like me and...

25:40.951 --> 25:42.807
I don't know, even
through, all the...

25:45.591 --> 25:46.422
Yeah.

25:47.863 --> 25:51.318
She was never attached
like this to me or to Jack

25:51.351 --> 25:54.038
and definitely not to
some stuffed animal, so.

25:55.191 --> 25:59.446
Well, there's really nothing
unusual about her behavior.

25:59.479 --> 26:03.254
She's pretty typical of a kid
that's suffering from anxiety.

26:03.286 --> 26:07.415
And the bear, Ricky,
is her comfort object.

26:07.446 --> 26:09.366
He helps her feel safe.

26:09.398 --> 26:12.406
And after he seizure
at the park, you know,

26:12.438 --> 26:13.591
her attachment to you,

26:13.622 --> 26:15.670
her mother and her caregiver,

26:15.703 --> 26:17.110
it makes more sense.

26:17.142 --> 26:18.614
It really scared her.

26:23.446 --> 26:27.127
Or it could be some
belated anxiety.

26:28.662 --> 26:30.615
The fear of losing you
when you were struggling.

26:30.646 --> 26:33.079
She could've buried that

26:33.110 --> 26:36.727
and the incident triggered
some repressed emotion.

26:39.126 --> 26:40.311
Listen, Beth, I,

26:41.751 --> 26:45.334
no, I think that Meg is
lucky to have you as a mom.

26:45.367 --> 26:46.742
I really do, I mean,
especially since you can

26:46.775 --> 26:49.014
understand what she's
going through right now.

26:50.710 --> 26:53.110
But you have to remember
that you're an example.

26:53.143 --> 26:55.671
You're an example
of how to be strong,

26:55.702 --> 26:58.262
an example of how to
recover from a tough time.

26:59.671 --> 27:00.502
Yeah.

27:02.487 --> 27:05.494
But to go back to
your original question,

27:06.487 --> 27:10.231
yeah, yeah, I do think that
the anxiety is getting worse.

27:11.414 --> 27:15.286
She understands the
idea of a worry monster

27:15.319 --> 27:17.526
and I think the coping
skills I'm teaching her

27:17.558 --> 27:19.734
are helping her get
through the school day but

27:20.758 --> 27:25.462
I'm gonna recommend a
psychiatrist outside of school.

27:26.582 --> 27:27.638
She's really good.

27:28.630 --> 27:31.543
And depending on what her
pediatrician says, it...

27:34.551 --> 27:37.974
It may be time for some
low grade medication.

27:38.006 --> 27:40.246
- No, I'm not...
- Listen, I understand.

27:40.279 --> 27:42.967
It's just, she just
may need a little help

27:42.998 --> 27:46.614
until she gets older and develops
more mature coping skills.

27:52.727 --> 27:55.607
So let's get her
back to class, huh?

27:57.334 --> 27:58.166
Okay.

27:59.222 --> 28:00.374
Hey, Meg.

28:00.407 --> 28:01.782
Meg, come on, come on.

28:04.791 --> 28:07.127
Well, we ran over
just a bit, didn't we?

28:07.159 --> 28:09.047
I actually have
to get to another student.

28:09.079 --> 28:11.286
But Meg, can you do me a favor?

28:11.318 --> 28:13.654
Hey, Meg?

28:13.687 --> 28:14.839
Can you do me a favor
and show your mom

28:14.871 --> 28:17.590
how brave you can be
by going to class?

28:17.623 --> 28:18.454
Yeah.

28:19.222 --> 28:20.822
Come on.

28:20.854 --> 28:22.870
Well Meg, hey, I'm gonna
walk you to your classroom

28:22.902 --> 28:25.238
but then I need to go, okay?

28:25.270 --> 28:27.255
Can you say thank
you to Mr. Taylor?

28:30.582 --> 28:31.734
That's okay, it's all right.

28:31.766 --> 28:32.918
You guys go on ahead.

28:32.950 --> 28:33.878
I'll catch up with
you later, okay?

28:33.910 --> 28:34.678
- Thank you.
- All right.

28:34.711 --> 28:35.542
Bye, Meg.

28:37.911 --> 28:39.190
Okay honey, come on.

28:39.767 --> 28:41.655
- Don't want...
- Meg.

28:41.687 --> 28:42.807
No, don't make me go to class.

28:42.840 --> 28:44.918
Okay, Meg, hey look, it's
gonna be a short day, okay,

28:44.950 --> 28:46.071
'cause of our meeting.

28:46.102 --> 28:49.270
So you'll only be here
a few hours, okay?

28:49.303 --> 28:50.582
- Meg, Meg.
- Please.

28:51.958 --> 28:52.982
- You need to go to class.
- I want to stay with you.

28:53.014 --> 28:54.934
Okay, Meg, Meg!

28:56.854 --> 28:58.870
Okay, look, you
need to go to class.

28:58.903 --> 29:00.278
Okay, come on, let's go.

29:00.310 --> 29:01.142
No.

29:03.414 --> 29:05.078
Okay, well I'm leaving.

29:05.110 --> 29:08.374
This is your last chance
for me to walk you to class.

29:15.894 --> 29:18.646
Okay Meg, that's as
far as I'm going, okay?

29:18.678 --> 29:20.087
- My stomach.
- No.

29:20.119 --> 29:20.758
Okay, hey, look.

29:20.791 --> 29:22.007
You need to go to class, okay?

29:22.039 --> 29:23.863
It's right over there.

29:23.895 --> 29:26.711
Meg, Meg, Meg, stop!

29:26.743 --> 29:28.342
Okay, I love you, okay?

29:28.374 --> 29:29.270
More than you know.

29:29.302 --> 29:31.095
But I'll see you very soon.

29:31.126 --> 29:31.990
No, stop.

29:37.207 --> 29:39.862
Mommy.

30:01.974 --> 30:03.191
Mr. Bertram,
can you please send

30:03.223 --> 30:06.390
Theodore Hutchins to the
office to meet his father?

30:08.854 --> 30:10.262
What is that?

30:12.759 --> 30:13.815
Is that hair?

30:15.318 --> 30:16.246
It is hair.

30:17.655 --> 30:19.511
You little shit.

30:19.543 --> 30:21.495
I'm telling your teacher.

30:21.527 --> 30:24.118
Go ahead, she
won't believe you.

30:24.151 --> 30:25.846
You aren't supposed
to be out here anyway.

30:25.878 --> 30:26.870
Where's your pass?

30:30.871 --> 30:33.782
Wait a minute, I
know who you are.

30:33.814 --> 30:34.871
And I know about your mom.

30:36.374 --> 30:37.751
No wonder you're such a freak.

30:39.703 --> 30:42.326
Don't you ever touch
my stuff, it's mine.

30:45.591 --> 30:46.423
Meg!

30:48.086 --> 30:49.367
Are you okay?

30:49.399 --> 30:50.806
Yeah.

30:50.838 --> 30:52.502
Okay, just go back
to class for now.

30:52.534 --> 30:53.207
I'll check in later.

30:56.151 --> 30:59.478
Meg, we need to talk.

31:00.662 --> 31:02.679
Look, I know you're
struggling right now,

31:02.711 --> 31:05.591
but that behavior is
absolutely unacceptable

31:05.623 --> 31:07.543
and won't be tolerated.

31:07.575 --> 31:08.471
Do you understand?

31:09.463 --> 31:11.158
I'm sorry, Mrs. Jean.

31:11.191 --> 31:14.135
I just got frustrated.

31:14.167 --> 31:15.159
Please believe me.

31:15.191 --> 31:16.151
Oh I do, I do.

31:19.862 --> 31:22.742
Listen, we'll talk
about this later, okay?

31:22.775 --> 31:23.863
You're not off the hook.

31:27.575 --> 31:29.463
All right kids,
settle down, please.

31:40.886 --> 31:42.390
Meg, eat your dinner, please.

31:52.438 --> 31:53.591
Can I have cereal?

31:53.623 --> 31:54.390
- No, this is dinner.
- Well you can have some

31:54.423 --> 31:55.511
chocolate milk and

31:56.535 --> 31:58.359
- a banana if you...
- Hold on.

31:58.391 --> 32:00.822
Please, eat a little
more of your dinner

32:00.854 --> 32:02.774
and you can have
some chocolate milk.

32:02.806 --> 32:04.886
You can have a banana
now though, go ahead.

32:10.550 --> 32:12.310
Can't just feed her
crap all the time.

32:12.342 --> 32:13.206
You can't always give into her.

32:13.238 --> 32:14.583
I don't always give in.

32:19.286 --> 32:20.535
Listen, I got a call
from Mrs. Jean today.

32:20.567 --> 32:24.694
Apparently Meg got into an
altercation with another student.

32:25.367 --> 32:27.287
What?

32:27.319 --> 32:28.726
I don't know all
the details but

32:28.758 --> 32:30.422
apparently it was
an older student

32:30.454 --> 32:32.055
so they have to look into it.

32:32.087 --> 32:34.039
So an older student hurt Meg.

32:34.071 --> 32:35.927
Why didn't Miss Jean call me?

32:35.959 --> 32:39.094
No, it sounds like Meg's
the one that got physical,

32:39.126 --> 32:41.206
and you know why Miss
Jean didn't call you.

32:44.599 --> 32:47.094
I just think she
needs more discipline

32:47.126 --> 32:49.014
instead of everyone
caving into her.

32:49.046 --> 32:50.295
I mean, we've been
bending over backwards

32:50.326 --> 32:52.246
for her for a long time now.

32:52.279 --> 32:55.095
Ah, absolutely not, put it back.

33:00.599 --> 33:02.326
Okay, hey, hey, no.

33:05.014 --> 33:07.287
We need to talk more
about this later, okay?

33:07.319 --> 33:08.150
Okay.

33:09.463 --> 33:10.486
Meggie.

33:11.383 --> 33:12.790
I need you to be a big girl

33:12.822 --> 33:14.677
and put yourself to
bed tonight, okay?

33:15.830 --> 33:18.486
I need Mommy to
sing to me, I need it!

33:18.517 --> 33:21.654
Okay, okay, okay, look.

33:21.687 --> 33:24.695
Hey Meg, we'll do your special
song and our kiss, okay?

33:24.727 --> 33:27.382
But I will not
lay down with you.

33:29.110 --> 33:30.583
I know you can
do this, sweetie.

33:31.447 --> 33:34.231
I remember when you were
about four years old

33:34.263 --> 33:36.918
and you found a black snake.

33:36.950 --> 33:38.135
You wrapped it around
your neck like a scarf.

33:38.167 --> 33:39.798
All the other kids
ran away from you.

33:39.830 --> 33:41.206
You wanted to keep it as a pet.

33:42.103 --> 33:44.406
Mommy was terrified,
do you remember that?

33:45.847 --> 33:47.222
I don't remember that.

33:49.302 --> 33:50.583
Please, Daddy?

33:50.615 --> 33:51.703
No, sweetie.

33:51.735 --> 33:53.270
You need to start
listening to me

33:53.302 --> 33:54.646
and stop arguing all the time.

33:54.679 --> 33:56.566
And that goes with everyone.

33:56.599 --> 33:59.383
Including your classmates
and your teachers, right?

34:00.790 --> 34:02.550
Things are gonna
change around here.

34:12.373 --> 34:13.237
I hate him.

34:13.879 --> 34:16.022
No, no.

34:16.054 --> 34:18.197
No, sweetie, you don't.

34:18.230 --> 34:19.223
Yes, I do.

34:23.415 --> 34:25.079
Come here, can you please try

34:25.110 --> 34:26.774
and eat something for me, hmm?

34:27.415 --> 34:28.983
Please eat your food for me.

34:33.558 --> 34:34.935
The animals stopped to listen.

34:36.214 --> 34:38.775
They could hear
and sense a shift.

34:40.663 --> 34:43.286
In the breeze,
something was coming.

34:43.319 --> 34:44.375
Bear turned to cue.

34:46.455 --> 34:47.991
Mommy?

34:48.023 --> 34:49.621
Hmm, yeah?

34:49.654 --> 34:51.541
Do you miss me during the day?

34:52.822 --> 34:54.389
Yes, of course I do.

34:56.085 --> 34:58.935
Did you miss your parents
when they were gone?

35:00.277 --> 35:01.719
Yeah.

35:01.750 --> 35:02.743
Yeah, I guess.

35:03.670 --> 35:07.510
But it was a different time
and way of raising kids.

35:09.814 --> 35:11.191
Why don't you talk about them?

35:12.183 --> 35:13.175
Oh, honey.

35:14.199 --> 35:15.959
It's complicated, hmm?

35:16.854 --> 35:18.550
I just hope I can be
a better parent to you

35:18.582 --> 35:20.055
than mine were to me.

35:23.895 --> 35:27.414
I'm sorry you don't have
a mom and dad anymore.

35:28.407 --> 35:30.359
Well, I have you, hmm?

35:30.391 --> 35:31.926
And I have your dad.

35:32.566 --> 35:34.263
And you two are all I need.

35:36.343 --> 35:39.255
Are you still trying to
get another teaching job?

35:40.534 --> 35:42.454
Why yes, Meg, I am.

35:42.486 --> 35:44.534
But I haven't
heard anything yet.

35:46.903 --> 35:48.150
Good.

35:48.855 --> 35:51.670
That is
not very supportive.

36:20.599 --> 36:23.350
We
can't do this, don't.

36:23.383 --> 36:26.677
Please, don't make me do this.

36:26.710 --> 36:27.541
Please.

37:34.359 --> 37:38.326
All right.

38:22.774 --> 38:23.927
Meg?

38:23.958 --> 38:25.815
Meg, what are you doing up?

38:25.847 --> 38:26.711
Where's your coat?

38:26.742 --> 38:27.894
Honey, you should be in bed.

38:30.103 --> 38:31.063
What's going on, honey?

38:32.086 --> 38:33.301
Meg?

38:35.030 --> 38:36.150
I'm sorry, Daddy.

38:41.046 --> 38:42.198
Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg.

38:42.231 --> 38:43.606
Put that down!

39:07.670 --> 39:10.741
Oh Meg, okay,
that's enough sugar.

39:21.014 --> 39:23.478
Hey, I said that is, stop.

39:23.511 --> 39:24.438
That's enough.

39:25.046 --> 39:26.743
You can eat it like that, okay?

39:32.439 --> 39:33.559
Okay, Meg, I'm just gonna,

39:33.590 --> 39:36.118
I'm gonna take this
call really quick, okay?

39:38.326 --> 39:39.510
Hello, this is Beth.

39:42.647 --> 39:43.990
Yes.

39:44.023 --> 39:46.678
Yes, I'm still interested
in the position.

39:50.166 --> 39:50.806
Okay.

39:52.374 --> 39:54.614
Oh yeah, I can absolutely be
available for the interview.

39:57.078 --> 39:58.263
Okay, no, that's great.

39:58.294 --> 39:59.958
Thank you, Mrs. Waters.

40:00.887 --> 40:01.974
Okay.

40:02.007 --> 40:03.927
All right, we'll see you later.

40:03.958 --> 40:04.758
Bye.

40:07.159 --> 40:07.958
Meg.

40:14.135 --> 40:15.511
Don't leave me.

40:32.983 --> 40:34.518
I'm here for Meg.

41:06.998 --> 41:08.982
Mommy's favorite
color is blue.

41:14.167 --> 41:16.822
Mommy's gonna leave me soon.

41:18.455 --> 41:20.054
Well, I didn't know that, Meg.

41:20.086 --> 41:21.462
Where is your mom going?

41:23.894 --> 41:25.110
I need her with me.

41:26.614 --> 41:28.022
I need her ready.

41:34.423 --> 41:35.862
But it's so hard to wait.

41:38.615 --> 41:40.023
Well, I don't understand, Meg.

41:40.054 --> 41:43.382
You just, first you said
that your mom's leaving,

41:44.375 --> 41:46.934
and now you're saying you're
waiting for her to be ready.

41:46.966 --> 41:47.894
I don't understand.

41:54.487 --> 41:55.895
Meg, did you make that sound?

41:57.559 --> 41:59.479
What sound?

41:59.510 --> 42:01.846
The clicking sound
with your tongue there.

42:02.998 --> 42:04.118
It's okay if you did.

42:04.150 --> 42:05.911
A lot of kids have
self-soothing methods.

42:12.631 --> 42:13.398
Meg.

42:15.095 --> 42:16.055
You need to let go.

42:17.719 --> 42:20.566
Meg, remember our rule, this...

42:22.262 --> 42:24.087
This is a safe
space for everyone.

42:25.366 --> 42:28.054
I didn't make that
sound but I know what did.

42:30.103 --> 42:32.983
Meg, you need to let go.

42:42.711 --> 42:44.855
I'm sorry, Mr. Taylor.

42:45.463 --> 42:46.966
Please don't tell my mommy.

42:57.974 --> 43:00.534
It's...

43:00.567 --> 43:02.102
It's okay, it's okay.

43:02.135 --> 43:03.542
You just have to
remember that in here,

43:03.574 --> 43:05.431
we use our words
and not our bodies.

43:23.671 --> 43:25.846
What time you taking
off in the morning?

43:25.879 --> 43:27.734
I want to hit the
road at about six.

43:31.414 --> 43:32.407
I'm just...

43:32.438 --> 43:34.870
Just not sure it's a good idea.

43:34.902 --> 43:38.263
What?

43:38.294 --> 43:41.047
Come on, I don't understand
your attitude about this.

43:41.078 --> 43:44.087
This would be a second income
for us, some stability.

43:44.119 --> 43:45.878
And we might even
be able to move back

43:45.910 --> 43:48.375
to the old
neighborhood.

43:48.406 --> 43:49.879
Yeah, I'm just really
worried about Meg.

43:49.911 --> 43:51.638
I just...

43:51.670 --> 43:53.175
I just don't think
you should leave her.

43:54.614 --> 43:55.607
Well, hey.

43:56.854 --> 43:58.006
She let you put
her to bed tonight.

43:58.038 --> 44:00.151
That's a big step, right?

44:00.182 --> 44:01.014
Right.

44:02.102 --> 44:02.966
I'm just really
worried about her

44:02.998 --> 44:04.951
and I think you should be too.

44:06.806 --> 44:08.950
Okay, that's not fair.

44:08.983 --> 44:10.262
Okay, I haven't
worked in forever

44:10.294 --> 44:11.959
and you know how guilty
I feel about that.

44:11.991 --> 44:14.230
How guilty you've made
me feel about that.

44:15.574 --> 44:17.462
And you of all people know
how worried I am about her.

44:19.062 --> 44:19.894
I'm sorry.

44:21.046 --> 44:21.814
That was a shitty thing to say.

44:21.846 --> 44:23.350
I didn't mean it.

44:27.670 --> 44:30.422
Maybe I could give
you a massage.

44:30.454 --> 44:31.350
Make it up to you.

44:32.982 --> 44:33.814
Okay.

44:41.590 --> 44:42.582
Yeah, right there.

44:42.615 --> 44:43.958
There, okay.

44:52.022 --> 44:53.878
That's not a massage.

44:53.911 --> 44:55.063
Yeah, it is.

44:58.582 --> 45:01.654
Okay, at least let me
close the door, okay?

45:01.687 --> 45:04.054
We don't have
to, it'll be okay.

45:41.494 --> 45:43.159
Tell me you like it.

45:43.191 --> 45:45.878
Hey, let me at least
close the door real quick.

45:45.911 --> 45:47.286
It's okay.

45:47.318 --> 45:48.919
It's not, Jack.

45:48.951 --> 45:50.102
Tell me you like it.

45:50.134 --> 45:51.542
Come on, tell me.

45:52.759 --> 45:54.454
Jack, stop.

47:59.511 --> 48:00.950
Damn it!

48:00.982 --> 48:03.734
Damn it.

48:06.774 --> 48:07.606
Great.

48:36.214 --> 48:39.094
We just
need to do this.

48:39.126 --> 48:41.655
She's not ready
if the egg's not ready.

48:41.686 --> 48:43.606
I need it.

48:43.639 --> 48:45.750
She's not ready.

48:48.375 --> 48:49.366
Jack.

48:51.319 --> 48:53.143
Jack, what's going on?

48:53.175 --> 48:55.126
You took a bad fall.

48:55.159 --> 48:57.302
Meg and I are
taking care of you.

48:57.334 --> 48:58.390
It's okay.

49:01.719 --> 49:03.671
Did you give me something?

49:06.006 --> 49:07.511
Shouldn't I be at the hospital?

49:08.566 --> 49:10.455
We took you to
the hospital, honey.

49:10.486 --> 49:11.415
You don't remember?

49:12.950 --> 49:15.191
The doctor said you just
need to stay still, okay?

49:15.223 --> 49:16.726
And rest.

49:16.758 --> 49:18.486
We can take care
of you, and yes,

49:18.517 --> 49:20.342
the doctor prescribed
some medication

49:20.374 --> 49:21.622
just to help manage the pain.

49:22.999 --> 49:23.831
It's okay.

49:28.695 --> 49:31.319
- No, Jack, I don't...
- It's okay.

49:31.351 --> 49:34.199
It's okay, the doctor
gave you the prescription.

49:34.231 --> 49:35.766
I told him your history.

49:35.797 --> 49:39.670
You're strong, Beth, but
you need to stay in bed.

49:39.702 --> 49:41.175
I know what's best for you.

49:41.206 --> 49:42.710
We both love you very much.

49:42.742 --> 49:44.470
We just want to
take care of you.

49:48.855 --> 49:50.294
Here, Mommy.

49:50.326 --> 49:52.182
It's okay, it's okay.

49:54.423 --> 49:56.790
Trust me, it's gonna be okay.

49:59.223 --> 50:00.630
It's all right.

52:14.871 --> 52:15.670
Help, Meg!

52:17.077 --> 52:18.934
It's okay.

52:21.591 --> 52:23.287
It's okay, it's okay.

52:24.310 --> 52:27.063
Jack.

52:28.183 --> 52:29.526
Aren't you glad
you didn't leave?

52:29.557 --> 52:33.046
If you'd left, you
wouldn't be here with us.

52:33.079 --> 52:34.261
Jack, I...

52:35.221 --> 52:38.423
Jack, I think I have to,
I need to get up, I think.

52:38.454 --> 52:39.703
No, no, no, no.

52:39.735 --> 52:41.590
- No, no, no.
- No, I can't, listen.

52:41.623 --> 52:44.022
I think...

52:44.055 --> 52:45.174
I think I'm feeling better

52:45.207 --> 52:48.439
and I need to call Mrs.
Waters and explain.

52:48.471 --> 52:49.335
Where's my phone?

52:49.366 --> 52:50.710
I already talked to her

52:50.742 --> 52:52.758
and I explained that
you need to stay home.

52:54.007 --> 52:54.871
No, but I want to.

52:54.903 --> 52:56.727
I want to go back to work.

52:56.759 --> 52:59.286
- I want to go back to work.
- I know, I know, I know.

53:00.694 --> 53:02.806
Shouldn't have
tried to go, Beth.

53:02.839 --> 53:04.311
- No.
- And I'm only saying that

53:04.343 --> 53:05.974
because I love you.

53:06.006 --> 53:07.543
You and Meg are
everything to me,

53:07.575 --> 53:10.935
but we cannot have another
incident like this happen.

53:10.967 --> 53:12.279
It's not fair to us.

53:17.206 --> 53:19.734
I keep having
these dreams and...

53:21.975 --> 53:23.317
And I don't understand.

53:28.086 --> 53:32.917
I'm so tired.

53:33.590 --> 53:34.486
I'm so tired.

53:38.871 --> 53:39.702
So tired.

53:43.095 --> 53:45.301
Jack, hi,
this is Ashe Taylor.

53:45.334 --> 53:47.317
I've been trying to
get in touch with Beth,

53:47.351 --> 53:49.431
but I wasn't having any luck.

53:49.463 --> 53:52.663
Meg has missed several
days of school, and well,

53:52.695 --> 53:55.861
I need to talk to
you both, actually,

53:55.894 --> 53:58.741
about an incident that happened
during our last session.

53:59.383 --> 54:01.239
Please give me a call, thanks.

54:40.311 --> 54:41.494
John
Marcus and Rob Dylan

54:41.527 --> 54:44.311
to the principal's office.

54:44.343 --> 54:46.519
Hey, thanks for getting
down here so quick.

54:46.550 --> 54:47.991
I really appreciate it.

54:52.183 --> 54:53.206
Please sit down.

54:55.927 --> 54:57.398
I see you brought Teddy.

54:58.774 --> 55:01.110
Need a little extra
comfort today, or?

55:05.111 --> 55:05.941
Yes.

55:09.463 --> 55:10.390
Okay, well.

55:12.247 --> 55:16.566
I noticed that Meg's missed
several days of school.

55:16.598 --> 55:17.526
Is everything okay?

55:19.863 --> 55:20.694
Her...

55:22.295 --> 55:23.767
Her mom was in an accident.

55:27.639 --> 55:30.614
Wow, I didn't know.

55:30.646 --> 55:32.247
Do we need to reschedule this?

55:32.278 --> 55:34.231
- I mean, I understand if you...
- No, no.

55:36.279 --> 55:37.334
It's a good distraction.

55:40.631 --> 55:42.103
Okay, well.

55:42.134 --> 55:45.335
Now this must be
horrible for Meg.

55:46.262 --> 55:48.631
For everyone, of course,
but especially for Meg.

55:53.719 --> 55:57.271
And I hate to talk
about this now but

55:57.303 --> 55:59.479
I have to file an
incident report

55:59.510 --> 56:02.359
with my supervisor
and the school.

56:02.390 --> 56:05.462
And I just wanted to talk
to you about it first.

56:06.615 --> 56:08.758
Whenever there's a
physical altercation,

56:08.791 --> 56:12.854
a report has to be
filed and there are

56:13.462 --> 56:15.766
timeframes for things like this.

56:16.759 --> 56:21.815
And also, I think it's best
for Meg and for myself that

56:22.486 --> 56:23.735
I don't see her anymore.

56:27.031 --> 56:28.695
I just don't think
I can help her.

56:29.782 --> 56:32.502
I think she may need
more serious help

56:32.535 --> 56:33.718
than I first thought.

56:34.582 --> 56:35.894
I've just never...

56:38.422 --> 56:40.246
I've never had a
child react that way

56:40.886 --> 56:43.574
and from what I've been reading,

56:43.606 --> 56:46.038
it may indicate some
form of psychosis.

56:51.190 --> 56:52.150
I really hate to be giving you

56:52.183 --> 56:53.878
more bad news at
a time like this

56:53.911 --> 56:55.415
but at this moment in time,

56:55.446 --> 56:57.495
- I just really don't see...
- Just...

56:57.526 --> 56:59.446
Yeah, no,
please, I'm sorry.

57:00.886 --> 57:02.743
So what you're saying,

57:02.774 --> 57:04.182
I just want to
get this straight.

57:04.215 --> 57:05.142
Of course.

57:06.038 --> 57:10.231
You're saying that
my daughter hurt you.

57:11.062 --> 57:12.343
- Yes, I...
- My...

57:14.294 --> 57:19.094
Little bitty girl
daughter hurt you.

57:21.687 --> 57:24.534
Big old you, a grown ass man.

57:26.135 --> 57:29.431
I bet Meg would say otherwise.

57:31.126 --> 57:34.454
The two of you all alone
in this office together.

57:35.958 --> 57:36.791
I bet...

57:37.942 --> 57:40.118
No, I need to stop
you right there.

57:41.014 --> 57:44.791
My intention has always
been to help Meg.

57:46.551 --> 57:49.175
And right now, I am truly
worried about your daughter.

58:01.846 --> 58:02.678
Hey.

58:03.735 --> 58:06.038
I'm sorry, man, are you okay?

58:06.070 --> 58:10.903
Are you okay?

58:19.030 --> 58:22.390
Please.

59:24.951 --> 59:26.358
Won't be long now.

59:28.759 --> 59:29.623
I don't like waiting.

59:33.494 --> 59:35.350
Waiting for your
mommy to join us?

59:39.735 --> 59:41.495
She loves you very much.

59:48.662 --> 59:49.494
And so do I.

59:56.182 --> 59:58.902
But I would never leave
you like she tried to, Meg.

01:00:01.686 --> 01:00:05.110
No, you're wrong.

01:00:05.143 --> 01:00:06.711
What did you say?

01:00:08.374 --> 01:00:09.974
I told Ricky he was wrong.

01:00:12.246 --> 01:00:13.783
What's Ricky wrong about?

01:00:13.815 --> 01:00:15.767
He told me that
it would be easy.

01:00:17.719 --> 01:00:19.318
I don't know what you mean.

01:00:21.334 --> 01:00:24.951
He told me that he
would make her stay,

01:00:24.982 --> 01:00:27.127
but he didn't tell me
how hard it would be.

01:00:30.838 --> 01:00:34.262
I think you're being
very brave, sweetheart.

01:00:34.294 --> 01:00:35.511
And I don't think your mommy's

01:00:35.542 --> 01:00:38.295
ever gonna leave you ever again.

01:00:38.326 --> 01:00:39.318
Not anymore.

01:00:42.454 --> 01:00:46.423
Maybe it won't be so
hard when the time comes.

01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:51.223
I'm here for you.

01:00:52.247 --> 01:00:54.070
Forever and always.

01:00:55.606 --> 01:00:57.462
And if there's anything
I can do for you,

01:00:57.495 --> 01:00:59.671
anything at all, I will.

01:01:01.718 --> 01:01:04.086
You aren't enough
and you never will be.

01:01:16.183 --> 01:01:17.207
Hey.

01:01:23.959 --> 01:01:28.118
You want to draw a picture
with me, like we used to?

01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:30.998
Good morning, Mommy.

01:03:35.734 --> 01:03:36.854
Hey.

01:03:36.886 --> 01:03:37.974
Good morning, sweetie.

01:03:45.943 --> 01:03:47.190
Hey, did you bring me my,

01:03:47.991 --> 01:03:49.847
here they are, sweetie.

01:04:04.119 --> 01:04:05.943
Hey, you don't
have to worry about

01:04:05.975 --> 01:04:08.087
Mommy taking these pills, right?

01:04:12.887 --> 01:04:16.503
I'm all better and I
wouldn't mess up again.

01:04:26.359 --> 01:04:27.191
This looks good.

01:04:29.239 --> 01:04:32.823
But maybe you can
help me get up.

01:04:35.414 --> 01:04:37.430
Do you know where my
phone is, sweetie?

01:04:37.462 --> 01:04:38.806
You don't need your phone.

01:04:38.839 --> 01:04:41.206
I don't want you to get
better 'cause if you do

01:04:41.238 --> 01:04:42.583
then you'll try to leave again.

01:04:44.118 --> 01:04:44.950
No, hey.

01:04:45.942 --> 01:04:46.837
No, Meggie.

01:04:47.511 --> 01:04:48.918
Meggie, come here.

01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:50.774
Stay down!

01:04:50.806 --> 01:04:51.637
Meg!

01:04:53.047 --> 01:04:54.999
Good
morning, need anything?

01:04:56.983 --> 01:04:58.518
Could you
close the door, please?

01:04:58.550 --> 01:04:59.382
Sure.

01:05:01.623 --> 01:05:05.527
Oh God, it's so good
to see you.

01:05:05.559 --> 01:05:07.862
That was really thoughtful
of Jack to call you.

01:05:09.463 --> 01:05:11.797
Hey, I'm a little
worried about Meg.

01:05:11.830 --> 01:05:13.686
With me being hurt and all, I...

01:05:13.717 --> 01:05:16.151
Meg is as fine as she can be

01:05:16.183 --> 01:05:18.486
with almost losing her mother.

01:05:20.727 --> 01:05:23.286
If she's angry, she has
a good reason to be.

01:05:23.317 --> 01:05:24.150
Don't you think?

01:05:25.462 --> 01:05:29.334
Yeah but I think
if I could just get up...

01:05:29.367 --> 01:05:31.894
Yeah, don't have
any expectations.

01:05:34.551 --> 01:05:37.910
Just give her what she needs.

01:05:39.991 --> 01:05:42.550
It's gonna take time
for us to all adjust

01:05:42.582 --> 01:05:44.470
to our lives together.

01:05:46.294 --> 01:05:49.302
Just do your job.

01:05:52.054 --> 01:05:53.142
Okay, okay.

01:05:57.463 --> 01:05:59.894
I would do anything for her.

01:06:04.246 --> 01:06:05.175
You should too.

01:06:09.015 --> 01:06:10.230
Hey, Meggie.

01:06:12.214 --> 01:06:14.102
You take good care
of your mommy now.

01:06:16.246 --> 01:06:18.327
You should ask to
see her notebook.

01:06:19.415 --> 01:06:21.526
Her pictures are
quite inspiring.

01:06:26.199 --> 01:06:28.501
Hey Meg, Meg, hey.

01:06:28.534 --> 01:06:30.103
I'd love to see
your drawings, hmm?

01:06:35.735 --> 01:06:36.663
They're stupid.

01:06:37.911 --> 01:06:39.222
No.

01:06:39.254 --> 01:06:41.014
No, they're not.

01:06:41.046 --> 01:06:44.183
You've always been a
really good artist, hmm?

01:06:44.214 --> 01:06:45.495
Can you get them?

01:06:45.526 --> 01:06:46.902
I'd really like to see them.

01:07:24.310 --> 01:07:26.391
Hey, are those your drawings?

01:07:27.735 --> 01:07:28.567
Yeah?

01:07:35.926 --> 01:07:39.190
All right, let's see
what we got here, huh?

01:07:41.557 --> 01:07:42.390
Okay.

01:07:46.454 --> 01:07:47.895
Oh, that's pretty.

01:08:01.654 --> 01:08:04.183
Hey Meg, do you want
to talk about Ricky?

01:08:05.879 --> 01:08:09.910
No.

01:08:09.943 --> 01:08:11.830
I noticed Ricky
because I had a bear

01:08:11.863 --> 01:08:14.070
just like him when
I was your age.

01:08:14.871 --> 01:08:16.215
Did you talk to him?

01:08:17.751 --> 01:08:19.447
All the time.

01:08:19.479 --> 01:08:20.854
Yeah, he was my best friend.

01:08:22.486 --> 01:08:24.439
Did he talk back?

01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:25.877
Mm-hmm, yeah.

01:08:27.094 --> 01:08:28.183
I guess in my head he did.

01:08:29.206 --> 01:08:31.446
And he was my first kiss.

01:08:34.679 --> 01:08:35.863
Hey, Meg.

01:08:35.895 --> 01:08:37.654
I was just trying
to make you laugh.

01:08:40.759 --> 01:08:42.550
Come on, what is
this all about, huh?

01:08:43.671 --> 01:08:44.502
Nothing.

01:08:46.037 --> 01:08:47.701
Are you sure?

01:08:47.734 --> 01:08:48.725
Yes.

01:08:51.702 --> 01:08:52.501
Okay.

01:08:53.718 --> 01:08:54.839
Come here.

01:08:54.871 --> 01:08:55.863
Oh, come here, come here.

01:08:55.894 --> 01:08:57.558
Snuggle with me.

01:08:57.591 --> 01:08:59.286
All right, let's see.

01:09:07.639 --> 01:09:08.821
Meg, what is this?

01:09:11.158 --> 01:09:15.991
Hmm, what'd you just say?

01:09:16.533 --> 01:09:17.175
Meg.

01:09:18.551 --> 01:09:19.381
Hey, Meg.

01:09:20.374 --> 01:09:21.622
Meg.

01:09:21.654 --> 01:09:22.999
Meg, Meg!

01:09:23.029 --> 01:09:24.180
- Hey, Meg!
- I'm sorry.

01:09:24.214 --> 01:09:25.462
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, sweetie.

01:09:25.493 --> 01:09:27.734
I didn't mean...

01:09:27.765 --> 01:09:28.662
What's going on?

01:09:30.519 --> 01:09:31.350
You okay, Meg?

01:09:32.183 --> 01:09:34.486
Yeah, sorry, I
thought you were gone.

01:09:35.479 --> 01:09:38.903
Yeah well I can't be away
from my girls for too long.

01:09:39.734 --> 01:09:40.566
Huh.

01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:44.023
Well, I'm glad you're both here.

01:09:45.654 --> 01:09:47.895
I've actually been
doing some thinking.

01:09:47.926 --> 01:09:50.295
That's all I've
been doing lately.

01:09:50.327 --> 01:09:54.550
And I think I need to
cut back on those pills.

01:09:54.583 --> 01:09:56.470
They're, I don't know,

01:09:56.503 --> 01:09:59.701
they're making me really
foggy, just a little bit.

01:09:59.734 --> 01:10:02.614
And I think it's best if Meg

01:10:02.646 --> 01:10:04.983
goes back to school
tomorrow, okay?

01:10:06.103 --> 01:10:09.910
I mean, I need some
time to rest alone.

01:10:09.943 --> 01:10:12.727
Just to reorient myself.

01:10:24.406 --> 01:10:26.230
I'm gonna call the
doctor tomorrow.

01:10:27.223 --> 01:10:28.150
And I need to find my phone.

01:10:28.183 --> 01:10:33.014
And I have some errands
to run, so.

01:10:33.974 --> 01:10:36.375
Jack, I'm better, really.

01:10:36.407 --> 01:10:37.302
Oh boy.

01:10:38.166 --> 01:10:40.407
We've heard that before,
haven't we, sweetie?

01:10:40.438 --> 01:10:42.423
Okay no, no, that
isn't what I'm talking...

01:10:42.454 --> 01:10:43.606
You know, Beth?

01:10:43.639 --> 01:10:45.463
I think you're really tired.

01:10:45.494 --> 01:10:48.918
We should go and we can
talk about this tomorrow.

01:10:48.951 --> 01:10:50.263
Yeah but Jack, didn't
you hear anything

01:10:50.294 --> 01:10:52.214
about what I just said?

01:10:52.246 --> 01:10:53.591
Oh, you're funny, Mommy.

01:10:56.471 --> 01:10:58.870
I love you more than anything.

01:11:00.246 --> 01:11:02.101
Thank you.

01:11:02.135 --> 01:11:04.981
Ricky's going to
sleep with you tonight.

01:11:05.015 --> 01:11:07.095
I think you're almost ready.

01:11:10.998 --> 01:11:11.831
Okay.

01:11:47.671 --> 01:11:48.502
Mommy.

01:11:50.774 --> 01:11:51.990
Give it time.

01:11:53.623 --> 01:11:55.095
But Mommy.

01:11:55.127 --> 01:11:55.958
You heard her.

01:11:56.790 --> 01:11:59.254
She said she was
gonna leave you again.

01:13:20.150 --> 01:13:21.335
I'm not ready.

01:13:36.918 --> 01:13:37.751
Jack, Jack, open up!

01:13:39.254 --> 01:13:44.086
Jack, Jack,
please, come in here!

01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:46.903
Jack!

01:13:46.934 --> 01:13:49.783
I'm sorry, baby, I'm
sorry, I didn't mean it.

01:13:49.814 --> 01:13:51.799
- Please, Meg, I'm sorry.
- Jack, get it out!

01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:53.942
Get it out!

01:13:53.975 --> 01:13:57.111
Help, Jack, please, get in here!

01:13:57.142 --> 01:13:58.102
Jack!

01:14:00.214 --> 01:14:01.815
Jack, Jack, Jack, it's in here.

01:14:01.846 --> 01:14:02.871
Okay, it's in here, I saw it.

01:14:02.902 --> 01:14:04.087
- I saw it in my dream.
- Calm down.

01:14:04.118 --> 01:14:05.078
- Beth, please.
- No, this is what...

01:14:05.110 --> 01:14:06.103
- Beth, you're acting crazy.
- This is what Meg

01:14:06.134 --> 01:14:07.415
was drawing about, please.

01:14:07.446 --> 01:14:08.502
- Just get it out.
- Beth!

01:14:08.535 --> 01:14:09.398
- Please, please!
- Shut up,

01:14:09.431 --> 01:14:10.262
you fucking junkie bitch!

01:14:22.519 --> 01:14:23.766
Give me Ricky.

01:14:28.695 --> 01:14:29.751
Let's go, sweetie.

01:15:05.078 --> 01:15:07.830
I'm sorry Mommy
did that to you.

01:15:59.031 --> 01:16:01.303
What the hell is this?

01:16:03.254 --> 01:16:04.598
What was that?

01:16:05.686 --> 01:16:07.990
Your mouths, what
was in your mouths?

01:16:12.534 --> 01:16:15.446
Beth, you're not
thinking clearly.

01:16:16.598 --> 01:16:19.382
You've had a bad brain injury,
you're on heavy medication.

01:16:19.414 --> 01:16:22.487
You're probably hallucinating
some crazy shit.

01:16:34.999 --> 01:16:38.647
Marissa, I want you
to get out of my house.

01:16:39.607 --> 01:16:42.647
Meg, you know I have to
stay with you and Jack.

01:16:42.679 --> 01:16:45.527
I said get out or I
will call the police.

01:16:45.559 --> 01:16:47.670
Oh, and what are
you gonna tell them?

01:16:49.078 --> 01:16:52.598
That you're a selfish bitch
that leaves her family?

01:16:52.630 --> 01:16:54.710
That's addicted to painkillers?

01:16:55.702 --> 01:16:58.582
Makes her family
lose everything?

01:16:58.614 --> 01:17:02.102
Sees things everywhere
that aren't there

01:17:02.134 --> 01:17:03.703
and can't even satisfy

01:17:03.735 --> 01:17:05.687
- her own husband?
- Shut up!

01:17:08.535 --> 01:17:10.423
Come on, let me stay.

01:17:12.886 --> 01:17:13.974
We can be a family.

01:17:16.918 --> 01:17:19.991
I can help you be
who you need to be.

01:17:21.975 --> 01:17:23.831
You have to let me stay.

01:17:27.638 --> 01:17:29.623
I said get out.

01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:42.167
Wow.

01:17:43.414 --> 01:17:44.470
Don't you think
you're overreacting

01:17:44.502 --> 01:17:45.302
- a little bit?
- No, Jack, I want you

01:17:45.334 --> 01:17:46.167
to leave too.

01:17:46.199 --> 01:17:47.382
And what are you
gonna do if I don't?

01:17:49.238 --> 01:17:50.295
Daddy, you don't
have to leave.

01:17:50.326 --> 01:17:53.110
Mommy, please, let's go.

01:17:53.142 --> 01:17:54.487
Mommy, please, can we go?

01:17:55.479 --> 01:17:57.975
Beth, Beth, I love you.

01:17:58.006 --> 01:18:00.151
No, no, I don't know
who you are anymore, Jack.

01:18:00.182 --> 01:18:01.622
No, you put your hands on me.

01:18:01.654 --> 01:18:03.542
You put your hands
on your daughter.

01:18:03.574 --> 01:18:05.462
And what the fuck was
that with Marissa?

01:18:05.494 --> 01:18:06.742
I don't know

01:18:06.774 --> 01:18:07.959
- what's happening.
- Was that what was in Ricky?

01:18:07.991 --> 01:18:09.175
It was, I mean, it
was in your mouth.

01:18:09.207 --> 01:18:11.286
- What is it? What is going on?
- Don't know what's going on!

01:18:11.318 --> 01:18:12.566
I just think there's
something wrong with you.

01:18:12.598 --> 01:18:14.839
I'm seriously worried
about you, Beth.

01:18:14.871 --> 01:18:17.494
No, no, Jack.

01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:19.158
You need to leave or I
will call the police.

01:18:19.190 --> 01:18:20.535
Don't tempt me, get out.

01:18:21.559 --> 01:18:22.455
Get out!

01:18:24.182 --> 01:18:26.742
Meg, I'll always be near.

01:18:28.311 --> 01:18:29.686
Mommy will figure it out.

01:18:31.927 --> 01:18:32.887
Don't worry.

01:18:44.439 --> 01:18:46.742
Mommy, are you gonna
make me leave too?

01:18:46.774 --> 01:18:48.086
No, hey, no.

01:18:48.118 --> 01:18:50.646
No, no, no, I would
never, ever do that, okay?

01:18:50.678 --> 01:18:53.718
Hey, I just, I need some time
away from your Daddy, okay?

01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:55.991
Just some time to think, hmm?

01:18:56.951 --> 01:18:58.646
Why did you hurt Ricky?

01:18:58.678 --> 01:19:01.879
Okay, no, I thought I
saw something in him, okay?

01:19:01.911 --> 01:19:03.735
I was confused.

01:19:05.527 --> 01:19:08.375
- Ricky forgives you.
- Okay, hey, hey.

01:19:08.407 --> 01:19:10.038
Look, hey, we're gonna be okay.

01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:11.351
I know, I'm sorry.

01:19:12.343 --> 01:19:14.902
It's okay, it's okay.

01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:24.342
It's okay.

01:20:10.743 --> 01:20:13.687
It's time for your
medicine, Mommy.

01:20:13.719 --> 01:20:14.807
Let's get you back in bed.

01:20:17.046 --> 01:20:18.998
Let's lay down and
make you feel better.

01:20:27.734 --> 01:20:29.207
Meg.

01:20:29.239 --> 01:20:31.799
Meg, is there
someone in the house?

01:20:34.518 --> 01:20:35.799
Is it your daddy?

01:20:37.591 --> 01:20:39.062
It's just you and me, Mommy.

01:20:48.439 --> 01:20:49.750
No, uh-uh.

01:20:51.159 --> 01:20:52.662
No, I need to keep
a clear head, okay?

01:20:52.694 --> 01:20:53.622
No more medication.

01:20:58.294 --> 01:21:00.631
God, I don't like this.

01:21:00.663 --> 01:21:02.487
Honey, you look so tired.

01:21:04.182 --> 01:21:05.559
Come here, come here.

01:21:09.559 --> 01:21:12.279
How many days have
you been out of school, huh?

01:21:18.454 --> 01:21:19.767
Okay, I have to stop this, Meg.

01:21:19.799 --> 01:21:20.630
This isn't right.

01:21:28.407 --> 01:21:29.655
You want me to
be happy, right?

01:21:29.686 --> 01:21:30.519
Mm-hmm.

01:21:31.671 --> 01:21:33.942
You hurt me when you
took my daddy away.

01:21:33.974 --> 01:21:36.886
That made me sad,
it made me scared.

01:21:41.239 --> 01:21:43.542
- Okay.
- I feel safe here.

01:21:45.111 --> 01:21:45.975
Okay.

01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:48.342
Okay.

01:21:51.735 --> 01:21:54.679
Hey, I think we should
call the school tomorrow.

01:21:54.711 --> 01:21:56.407
Okay, just...

01:21:56.439 --> 01:21:57.431
Just to check in though.

01:22:02.263 --> 01:22:05.047
Meg, I need to get
outta this house.

01:22:05.079 --> 01:22:07.382
Okay, I need to get
things figured out and...

01:22:10.647 --> 01:22:12.470
I think I need to
talk to someone.

01:22:13.846 --> 01:22:16.022
Someone like Mr. Taylor.

01:22:18.455 --> 01:22:19.287
Huh?

01:22:20.631 --> 01:22:24.023
I need to go to work and
you need to go to school.

01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:33.847
I'll tell everyone how
you keep seeing things

01:22:33.879 --> 01:22:35.510
and how confused you are.

01:22:40.407 --> 01:22:43.894
They'll come to the house
and see how dirty it is.

01:22:46.998 --> 01:22:48.886
They'll take me to my daddy.

01:22:49.527 --> 01:22:51.574
Would you want that, Mommy?

01:22:51.606 --> 01:22:52.246
No, no.

01:22:54.903 --> 01:22:56.727
Hey, look, I'm sorry.

01:22:57.847 --> 01:23:00.471
Baby, I'm sorry I
messed up before.

01:23:00.503 --> 01:23:02.294
Okay, but this isn't
the same thing.

01:23:02.326 --> 01:23:05.046
I'm all better now,
you know that, right?

01:23:05.077 --> 01:23:05.910
Hmm?

01:23:07.287 --> 01:23:10.455
Look, I just need to
sleep a little bit

01:23:10.486 --> 01:23:12.726
and then we'll get all
this figured out, okay?

01:23:15.319 --> 01:23:16.150
Okay.

01:23:18.582 --> 01:23:19.414
Okay.

01:23:25.815 --> 01:23:26.647
Okay.

01:24:19.095 --> 01:24:19.926
Meg?

01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:14.903
Mommy, look what
I built for you.

01:25:46.422 --> 01:25:47.799
I can't wait anymore.

01:25:48.919 --> 01:25:51.511
We have to, the egg.

01:25:51.543 --> 01:25:52.981
It's not time.

01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:55.351
Jack.

01:25:56.599 --> 01:25:58.103
Jack.

01:25:58.134 --> 01:26:00.375
Beth, honey,
just try and relax.

01:26:00.406 --> 01:26:01.399
- Just breathe.
- Jack!

01:26:04.631 --> 01:26:06.103
- Beth.
- Jack, no!

01:26:09.879 --> 01:26:10.807
You'll be okay.

01:26:12.471 --> 01:26:13.302
Think about Meg.

01:26:15.735 --> 01:26:16.726
Be strong for Meg.

01:26:18.998 --> 01:26:20.118
Should
give her the shot.

01:26:20.151 --> 01:26:22.198
She struggles to reject
the nesting process.

01:26:24.951 --> 01:26:26.038
Not time yet.

01:26:33.974 --> 01:26:35.190
Mommy.

01:26:40.278 --> 01:26:41.623
Sometimes I dream
that I was still

01:26:41.654 --> 01:26:44.790
a little baby inside your belly.

01:26:51.094 --> 01:26:52.918
You were such
a beautiful baby.

01:26:56.375 --> 01:27:01.206
When I first held
you in my arms, I...

01:27:03.574 --> 01:27:05.207
I was so in love.

01:27:06.583 --> 01:27:08.790
Love I'd never felt before.

01:27:12.822 --> 01:27:15.479
And what a personality you had.

01:27:17.911 --> 01:27:20.535
I knew you would
take over the world.

01:27:29.334 --> 01:27:31.862
Did you like it when
I was a little baby?

01:27:36.310 --> 01:27:37.143
Yeah.

01:27:38.326 --> 01:27:42.134
Though I love you
even more now than

01:27:44.535 --> 01:27:47.447
I ever thought
possible.

01:27:50.583 --> 01:27:51.414
I just...

01:27:53.975 --> 01:27:57.238
I wish the day in the
park had never happened.

01:27:59.798 --> 01:28:02.007
That I could've
been strong for you.

01:28:02.038 --> 01:28:04.150
That I could've been
the one to save you.

01:28:07.990 --> 01:28:09.462
And even before that, I...

01:28:10.135 --> 01:28:12.438
I wish I'd been a better mother.

01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:17.590
And I wasn't so weak.

01:28:21.367 --> 01:28:23.191
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.

01:28:25.847 --> 01:28:27.862
You don't have to be sorry.

01:28:27.894 --> 01:28:30.486
I almost have everything I need.

01:28:35.926 --> 01:28:38.774
What else do
you need, sweetie?

01:28:41.175 --> 01:28:43.383
I need you to be like me.

01:28:51.286 --> 01:28:52.118
Okay.

01:28:55.446 --> 01:28:56.086
Okay.

01:29:03.222 --> 01:29:04.630
Your head is
hurting, isn't it?

01:29:05.686 --> 01:29:07.478
I can tell.

01:29:07.510 --> 01:29:09.750
How about after you
take your medicine,

01:29:10.454 --> 01:29:13.270
we can go get in
the bath and relax?

01:29:53.590 --> 01:29:56.438
Mommy, it's okay,
you're beautiful.

01:30:02.326 --> 01:30:05.014
Meg, what are we doing, hmm?

01:30:22.486 --> 01:30:25.014
Meggie, I have
all my clothes on.

01:30:41.142 --> 01:30:43.862
You're taking such
good care of me, Meg.

01:30:48.343 --> 01:30:51.510
I should be the one
taking care of you.

01:30:53.238 --> 01:30:55.862
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:31:01.814 --> 01:31:03.030
- Mommy.
- Yeah.

01:31:05.367 --> 01:31:07.638
I want you to be
with me all the time.

01:31:07.671 --> 01:31:08.822
I know.

01:31:12.726 --> 01:31:13.718
I know, I...

01:31:15.223 --> 01:31:16.054
I do too.

01:31:21.335 --> 01:31:24.919
You have to do
something for me, Mommy.

01:31:24.951 --> 01:31:25.783
Okay.

01:31:26.614 --> 01:31:28.598
Okay, anything.

01:31:28.630 --> 01:31:30.326
Anything, sweetheart.

01:31:32.246 --> 01:31:37.078
I love you so much.

01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:40.982
- It'll all be over soon.
- Okay.

01:31:41.014 --> 01:31:41.846
Okay.

01:37:03.254 --> 01:37:05.046
Hey, can I have him?

01:37:06.359 --> 01:37:09.271
I don't know, he
is pretty creepy.

01:38:08.157 --> 01:38:13.157
