my personal opinions

33:07.811 --> 33:08.987
I appreciate that,

but we're not so different,
Dr. Goodwin.

33:11.511 --> 33:13.817
You've got your patients,
I've got my customers.

33:13.861 --> 33:16.820
We both have strong brands,
but if we're to expand,

33:16.864 --> 33:18.866
we have to dip our toes
into each other's water.

[chuckles]

33:37.276 --> 33:39.278

- No. Why?

33:39.321 --> 33:40.583
Would you like
your name bigger?

33:40.627 --> 33:44.283
I would like our name

- Hmm. Can we do that?
- No, we can't, Max.

I told you Wholesome's name
is the one nonnegotiable.

33:49.592 --> 33:53.292
Hmm. Yeah, sorry.
I did try. Believe me.

33:53.335 --> 33:56.425
So you're trying to shame us

33:56.469 --> 33:58.210

We're trying

34:06.783 --> 34:09.090
what you're selling
literally and figuratively.

34:09.134 --> 34:12.267
But sex workers are also
looking for legitimacy,

34:12.311 --> 34:14.922
not just in what they do, but
in how they're treated for it.

34:14.965 --> 34:17.751
And our job is to remove
the barriers between

34:17.794 --> 34:21.189
them and good healthcare,
so while we are legitimizing

34:21.233 --> 34:24.105
your brand, you are
legitimizing their profession.

34:24.149 --> 34:26.760
It's a win-win and, um...
