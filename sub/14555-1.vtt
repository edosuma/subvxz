(Joseph) 'What the fuck?'

00:24.525 --> 00:26.903
Fucking touch it,
I'll fucking kill you!

00:27.027 --> 00:28.995
Fucking wankers!

00:32.366 --> 00:34.789
You want it?

00:34.910 --> 00:37.834
Fucking cunts! Fucking money!
My fucking money!

00:37.955 --> 00:40.959
(Mumbles)

00:41.083 --> 00:42.926
Fucking cunts!

00:43.835 --> 00:47.214
I'll fucking tear yous apart
by your fucking throats!

00:47.339 --> 00:48.807
(Barks and whines)

00:48.924 --> 00:51.222
Cunts! They take your fucking money!

00:53.428 --> 00:55.101
Come on, you!

00:55.222 --> 00:56.815
(Barks)

00:56.932 --> 00:58.559
Shut the fuck up!

00:58.684 --> 01:00.152
(Yelps)

01:00.269 --> 01:02.897
(Whispers) Oh, fuck.

01:04.772 --> 01:06.821
(Breathes heavily)

03:10.399 --> 03:12.527
(Stamps book)

03:14.236 --> 03:17.490
- I've got a present for you.
- Oh, yeah?

03:17.614 --> 03:22.120
Home-made. Covert.
In fact, I've got it on me just now.

03:22.786 --> 03:24.413
Could be in my shoe.

03:25.789 --> 03:27.541
Might go off at any minute.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.676
Can you hear it?

03:29.793 --> 03:33.468
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock

03:33.588 --> 03:38.469
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick,
tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. Boom!

03:38.593 --> 03:42.973
Look, do you want your money,
or shall I call the police?

03:47.144 --> 03:48.646
I'm sorry.

03:48.770 --> 03:51.774
You keep coming here,
giving me your shit, mate.

03:53.608 --> 03:55.610
No, don't... Don't phone the police.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.613
I'm sorry. Just...

03:58.780 --> 04:00.657
Give me the money, please.

04:01.992 --> 04:03.539
(Sighs)

04:08.874 --> 04:12.424
Don't come here again, OK?

04:19.885 --> 04:21.432
OK.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.057
(Boys chatting)

05:05.430 --> 05:08.400
(Boy) Right, I'll tell you what,
if you miss this shot,

05:08.517 --> 05:10.235
you've got to suck my dick.

05:10.352 --> 05:12.821
You're going to get my dick,
and go...

05:12.938 --> 05:14.406
(Hums)

05:14.523 --> 05:18.118
And I want you humming on my balls.
And then I want...

05:18.235 --> 05:20.488
(Boy 2) You can suck this dick, mate.

05:20.612 --> 05:22.831
(Boy) I'll suck your dick!
Give it here!

05:22.948 --> 05:25.622
(BOY hums)

05:25.742 --> 05:28.962
Will you shut the fuck up?
Shut the fuck up!

05:31.581 --> 05:35.176
- What the fuck are you laughing at?
- Now, mate. Just a private joke.

05:35.293 --> 05:38.718
Well, do you want to share it?
Wanna give me a fucking laugh?

05:38.839 --> 05:41.342
- Not really.
- Right, well, fuck up then!

05:42.384 --> 05:45.729
- Doing my fucking head in!
- Who the fuck do you think you are?

05:45.846 --> 05:49.271
- (Boy 2) Leave it, Dan.
- Watch. Oi, what you staring at?

05:50.433 --> 05:52.606
Hey, what the fuck you staring at?

05:52.727 --> 05:55.571
Want this pool cue
wrapped round your fucking head?

05:55.689 --> 05:57.487
Fucking answer me!

05:57.607 --> 06:01.202
Do you want this pool cue
wrapped round your fucking head?

06:01.319 --> 06:02.787
- No.
- Right, then.

06:02.904 --> 06:06.283
Well, drink your drink, and
keep your fucking nose out. Prick!

06:07.576 --> 06:09.078
(Boy 2) Dan, watch it!

06:13.582 --> 06:15.050
(Pants)

06:15.166 --> 06:17.294
- Do you think I'm fucking a poof?
- No.

06:17.419 --> 06:19.638
- Do you think I'm a fucking poof?
- No.

06:19.754 --> 06:22.758
- Want to suck my cock?
- No. We've just come in for a drink.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.556
- You want to suck my cock?
- No!

06:24.676 --> 06:27.646
- Suck this!
- I don't know why you're doing this!

06:27.762 --> 06:29.810
(Sobs)

07:06.176 --> 07:08.270
(Breathes heavily)

07:14.643 --> 07:16.771
(Shop bell rings)

07:25.612 --> 07:27.080
Hello?

07:37.624 --> 07:39.297
Are you all right in there?

07:41.086 --> 07:43.555
Are you hiding from somebody?

07:46.758 --> 07:48.226
- Can I move this rail?
- No!

07:49.594 --> 07:51.062
OK.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.524
I can't just leave you there, though.

08:06.444 --> 08:07.866
What's your name?

08:11.116 --> 08:12.789
Robert De Niro.

08:15.870 --> 08:17.372
Would you like a cup of tea?

08:19.833 --> 08:21.301
Fuck off.

08:27.132 --> 08:29.851
Would you like me
to pray for you, Robert?

09:01.124 --> 09:05.800
Father, God, I'm asking you now
to touch this man,

09:05.920 --> 09:07.922
and to reach into his heart.

09:12.093 --> 09:13.970
He's in pain, Lord.

09:15.513 --> 09:18.642
I believe you've brought him to me
to help him find his way.

09:19.851 --> 09:21.728
He seems lost, Lord.

09:22.687 --> 09:25.281
Give him the strength to find a way.

09:26.483 --> 09:29.908
And let him know
that whatever is troubling him,

09:30.028 --> 09:34.204
he can confide in you
and ask for your forgiveness.

09:34.324 --> 09:36.418
(Sobs)

09:37.786 --> 09:39.333
OK.

09:40.288 --> 09:42.165
All right.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.649
Do you feel better now?

10:12.320 --> 10:13.867
Bye.

10:40.014 --> 10:43.393
- What you doing out at this time?
- Waiting for my mum.

10:44.435 --> 10:46.437
Has she gone out
and left you out here?

10:46.563 --> 10:48.486
No. She's in with her boyfriend.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.280
Where's Bluey?

10:53.695 --> 10:55.163
He died, son.

10:55.280 --> 10:56.827
How?

10:58.032 --> 10:59.579
Got run over.

11:01.286 --> 11:02.754
Are you sad?

11:02.871 --> 11:05.841
(Sighs) Yep.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.711
Are you gonna kill the man
that did it?

11:09.836 --> 11:13.306
It was a hit-and-run.
They never caught the guy.

11:13.423 --> 11:18.395
- It's a shame. I liked that dog.
- Yeah, me too.

11:19.470 --> 11:23.225
- Why did he sleep in the shed?
- Wife didn't like him in the house.

11:24.851 --> 11:29.277
Your wife's dead. Could've put him in
the house. She wouldn't have known.

11:29.397 --> 11:30.865
Old habits.

11:32.901 --> 11:36.280
(Woman) Sam. In. Now!

11:38.072 --> 11:40.916
- Night, son.
- Night, Joseph.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.918
All right, fucko!

11:46.039 --> 11:49.794
Hey, he's not gonna bite you.
He's just gonna fucking eat you!

11:49.918 --> 11:51.135
(Growls)

11:53.296 --> 11:55.173
What you looking at, you old cunt?

12:36.256 --> 12:38.350
(Grunting)

14:11.476 --> 14:12.944
- Hello.
- (Groans)

14:13.061 --> 14:14.608
sorry

14:17.482 --> 14:20.235
You're on my shutters.
Just I need to open up.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.412
Do you want to come in?

14:28.993 --> 14:30.540
I'll open up.

14:37.168 --> 14:38.636
(Groans)

14:42.632 --> 14:44.259
Here you go.

14:55.686 --> 14:57.654
So, what happened to you?

14:58.439 --> 15:00.066
Fell off my bike.

15:01.609 --> 15:05.659
OK. Well, you look like
you need to go to the hospital.

15:07.115 --> 15:09.743
Nah. I'll heal myself.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.127
I prayed for you last night.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.172
Yeah, well, it didn't fucking work.

15:18.292 --> 15:20.044
I think it did.

15:20.169 --> 15:22.263
Don't think he heard you, love.

15:24.340 --> 15:25.808
Why did you come here?

15:28.302 --> 15:29.770
I was just passing.

15:30.471 --> 15:35.068
There must be a reason. Do you want
God to forgive you for something?

15:35.184 --> 15:37.278
(Chuckles)

15:41.941 --> 15:44.820
I don't want anything from that fuck.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.823
- God loves you.
- Does he now?

15:48.698 --> 15:50.166
You're a child of God.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.661
God ain't my fucking daddy.

15:54.662 --> 15:56.790
My daddy was a cunt,
but he knew he was a cunt.

15:56.914 --> 15:59.713
God still thinks he's God.
Nobody's told him otherwise.

15:59.834 --> 16:03.008
- Why are you so angry at God?
- Why are you so fucking stupid?

16:04.338 --> 16:06.932
I've met people like you
all my fucking life.

16:07.049 --> 16:09.222
Goodie goodies.

16:09.343 --> 16:11.562
Make a charity record.

16:11.679 --> 16:14.808
Bake a cake. Save a fucking soul!

16:16.476 --> 16:18.899
You've never eaten shit.

16:19.020 --> 16:21.773
Don't know what it's like out there.
You haven't a clue!

16:25.359 --> 16:27.862
- Where do you live?
- What?

16:27.987 --> 16:31.332
I asked you where you lived.
Simple fucking question. You deaf?

16:32.742 --> 16:34.210
Manors Estate.

16:35.953 --> 16:37.876
Manors fucking Estate!

16:40.082 --> 16:42.756
How is Manors Estate?

16:42.877 --> 16:46.632
How are the five-bedroomed,
double-garaged, nicely trimmed lawn,

16:46.756 --> 16:50.681
fondue, coffee-morning
fucking lifestyle Manors Estate?

16:50.801 --> 16:53.725
How is it up there? Swimming, is it?

16:55.890 --> 16:58.313
What the fuck
are you doing down here, huh?

16:59.018 --> 17:01.567
What are you doing
running this shop?

17:01.687 --> 17:04.315
You're a young woman.
You have a family? Got kids?

17:05.608 --> 17:07.406
No. We can't have them.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.074
Can't or won't?

17:14.867 --> 17:16.961
This fills a gap, doesn't it?

17:18.246 --> 17:22.626
You reckon you do enough good deeds,
God's gonna fix your insides?

17:22.750 --> 17:24.252
Please.

17:29.257 --> 17:30.930
Or is your man a jaffa?

17:49.777 --> 17:51.324
Thanks for the tea.

17:53.239 --> 17:54.957
I'll pray for you.

17:58.869 --> 18:00.963
(Shop bell rings)

18:14.802 --> 18:16.270
(Sniffs)

18:22.810 --> 18:25.188
(Whispers)
What the fuck is wrong with you?

18:28.232 --> 18:29.950
I'm a fucking arse.

18:35.323 --> 18:37.872
You're a fucking...

18:37.992 --> 18:40.165
(Barman) You all right, Joseph?

18:40.286 --> 18:41.833
Yeah, I'm all right.

19:04.018 --> 19:06.362
Ready? Woo!

20:42.241 --> 20:44.335
(Door shuts)

20:44.827 --> 20:46.329
(James) Hannah?

20:49.665 --> 20:51.633
Hannah.

20:53.836 --> 20:55.258
Hannah.

20:57.298 --> 20:59.050
Hannah!

21:00.468 --> 21:02.470
Hannah!

22:17.419 --> 22:20.639
- Why didn't you come to bed?
- I conked out on the sofa.

22:23.175 --> 22:27.146
- Well, come up now, then.
- I'm all cleaned up now.

22:27.263 --> 22:31.609
- Get dirty again.
- Don't. I've lots to do before work.

22:31.725 --> 22:33.602
- It's not work.
- Don't!

22:47.950 --> 22:50.078
Well, I'll go and have a wank, then.

23:11.724 --> 23:13.271
Hi, Joseph.

23:16.604 --> 23:18.698
(Breathes heavily)

23:44.423 --> 23:45.891
Cheers.

23:49.511 --> 23:52.640
When you were wee, me and your dad
used to take you to the...

24:03.609 --> 24:05.828
(Mutters)

24:05.945 --> 24:07.822
What you saying?

24:07.947 --> 24:10.370
I'm fucked.

24:10.491 --> 24:13.244
I've fucked it.

24:14.495 --> 24:16.714
- Marie hates me.
- She doesn't hate you.

24:16.830 --> 24:18.548
Aye, she does. She hates me.

24:18.666 --> 24:21.795
She loves you. She loves you, man.
We all love you.

24:21.919 --> 24:23.887
I'm going to hell, Joseph.

24:24.004 --> 24:26.848
- No, no, no, no.
- I am.

24:28.676 --> 24:32.271
- Done some bad things.
- We've all done bad things, mate.

24:32.388 --> 24:34.891
Aye. Aye, but...

24:35.015 --> 24:37.109
(Sighs)

25:35.576 --> 25:37.578
- Do you want a hand?
- No, it's OK.

25:55.929 --> 25:58.398
Listen, sweetheart,
I came to say...

25:58.515 --> 26:00.062
My name is Hannah.

26:02.936 --> 26:05.485
I wanted to say that
I'm sorry for yesterday.

26:05.606 --> 26:07.825
Some of the things I said.
It got personal.

26:07.941 --> 26:09.864
Shall we just get out of this place?

26:39.890 --> 26:42.643
So, is that not
against your religion?

26:42.768 --> 26:45.988
- The lager thing?
- Supposedly.

26:47.648 --> 26:49.400
I won't tell the big man.

26:51.735 --> 26:53.612
So this is your world.

26:55.322 --> 26:57.165
Pretty much.

26:57.825 --> 26:59.998
What about your family?

27:00.119 --> 27:04.215
- Not got any.
- There must be somebody.

27:05.124 --> 27:08.799
Nope. Best friend's dying of cancer.

27:08.919 --> 27:11.013
I killed my dog. So I'm fucked.

27:11.130 --> 27:13.132
You killed your dog?

27:13.257 --> 27:16.431
Kicked his ribs in. My buddy.

27:17.553 --> 27:18.975
Why kick your buddy?

27:19.847 --> 27:23.647
Some cunt annoyed me in the bookies.
Came out, took it out on him.

27:25.018 --> 27:26.565
My Bluey.

27:31.275 --> 27:34.245
Joseph, what's the story
in Balamory?

27:34.361 --> 27:35.829
All right, Tommy.

27:38.115 --> 27:42.666
Listen, I heard what you done
to those Pakis.

27:42.786 --> 27:44.504
And what they done to you.

27:45.247 --> 27:47.670
We are, as we speak,
getting a mob together

27:47.791 --> 27:49.634
to ku-klux-klan the bastards.

27:49.751 --> 27:51.674
I fight my own battles, Tommy.

27:51.795 --> 27:56.175
It's not just you they've offended.
They have also offended me.

27:56.300 --> 28:00.806
The way they fucking leer at you.
I've got a pig's head.

28:00.929 --> 28:04.559
- I'm gonna post it to the bastards.
- Fucking leave it. Let it go.

28:04.683 --> 28:07.357
No, them pack animals,
they stick together.

28:07.477 --> 28:11.072
And us Celts, we've got
to stick together too, yeah?

28:11.190 --> 28:14.285
If a baby was on fire,
they wouldn't piss on it.

28:14.401 --> 28:16.153
A white baby, that is.

28:16.278 --> 28:18.872
And yet, correct me if I'm wrong,

28:18.989 --> 28:21.663
but we're doing all this
for their fucking kids

28:21.783 --> 28:24.787
with their tsunamis, monsoons
and what have you,

28:24.912 --> 28:26.664
natural fucking disasters!

28:26.788 --> 28:28.665
Am I right, or am I right, huh?

28:29.875 --> 28:32.424
- You going to the bookies later?
- Aye.

28:32.544 --> 28:34.763
- Yeah?
- An accumulator.

28:36.673 --> 28:39.142
If they all come in,
I'm gonna be a very rich man!

28:40.093 --> 28:42.391
Gonna buy myself a zoo.

28:42.512 --> 28:45.982
That's my fucking thing.
I love fucking animals, yeah?

28:46.099 --> 28:49.194
I'd fill the place
with exotic creatures, yeah?

28:49.311 --> 28:51.484
Like off the Blue Planet.

28:51.605 --> 28:54.449
Not your fucking
run-of-the-mill common or garden,

28:54.566 --> 28:56.239
or fucking diddly fucking zoo.

28:56.360 --> 29:01.992
No way. There'd be a lion,
a tiger and a pink panther.

29:02.115 --> 29:03.583
(Laughter)

29:03.700 --> 29:06.954
He knows! A pink fucking panther!

29:07.788 --> 29:09.210
(Sniffs)

29:09.331 --> 29:11.208
- Can I buy yous a drink?
- No.

29:11.333 --> 29:14.712
- An advance on me future fortune.
- No, we'll finish this and go.

29:23.845 --> 29:25.973
Sorry. Did he offend you?

29:26.682 --> 29:28.650
You offended me more.

29:31.895 --> 29:33.693
I've got to go.

29:33.814 --> 29:35.782
Would you do me a favour?

29:37.734 --> 29:41.864
(Hannah) I pray, Father, God, that you
take this man's soul into your hands,

29:41.989 --> 29:43.787
and be at his side.

29:45.492 --> 29:49.213
Be his guide, Lord.
Embrace him with your love.

29:49.329 --> 29:52.708
Take away his fear of the unknown,
Lord, and embrace him.

29:54.668 --> 29:57.842
Let him know
he need not fear anything, Lord.

29:57.963 --> 30:01.843
Life is just a part of existence
and death is eternal.

30:01.967 --> 30:07.019
Lord, I ask in your wisdom,
if you see fit to intervene,

30:07.139 --> 30:11.110
then help this man
on the road to recovery, Lord.

30:11.226 --> 30:14.526
(Voice fades) Lord, we know
you see the bigger picture.

30:14.646 --> 30:19.698
If, Lord, you think it's his time,
then we just ask you to embrace him.

30:20.944 --> 30:23.743
Welcome him with love...

30:47.763 --> 30:49.231
(Door slams shut)

30:53.393 --> 30:55.111
- Hey there!
- Hi. What you doing?

30:55.228 --> 30:58.482
Getting a drink and thinking
about getting something to eat.

30:58.607 --> 31:00.325
- Have you eaten?
- Yeah.

31:00.442 --> 31:02.240
OK. I'll get something light...

31:03.362 --> 31:05.456
I came by your shop today.

31:07.282 --> 31:08.829
And you wasn't there.

31:08.950 --> 31:12.830
No. My friend's husband's dying,
so she asked me to pray for him.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.420
Couldn't you pray in the shop?

31:16.541 --> 31:19.590
Yeah, but he's only got a couple of days,
and she was upset,

31:19.711 --> 31:22.009
so she wanted me
to be in the room with him.

31:25.842 --> 31:28.345
You were spotted with a man.

31:28.470 --> 31:30.814
What? That's rubbish!
Who'd make up that?

31:33.475 --> 31:36.854
- Family fortunes.
- What?

31:39.481 --> 31:41.859
The wheel of fortunes.

31:43.443 --> 31:44.911
Are you on something?

31:49.199 --> 31:52.920
- You don't dance with me any more.
- You should take me out, then.

31:55.288 --> 31:56.835
You don't fuck me any more.

31:57.457 --> 31:58.959
James.

32:00.419 --> 32:02.137
Do I smell like a dead animal?

32:03.422 --> 32:05.015
What?

32:05.132 --> 32:07.260
You fuck like a dead animal.

32:08.510 --> 32:10.478
What do you want me to say to that?

32:20.147 --> 32:21.899
(Banging)

32:27.320 --> 32:29.243
Joseph, what you doing, man?

32:30.073 --> 32:31.916
Knocking down the shed.

32:33.160 --> 32:35.583
- Why, son?
- It reminds me of Bluey.

32:37.330 --> 32:41.005
- That's a nice thing, man.
- It's all the bad things, son.

32:41.126 --> 32:45.051
All the stuff that's gonna rot
in my fucking head!

32:48.675 --> 32:50.677
(Man) Oi, fuckhead.

32:50.802 --> 32:53.180
Do you want to keep
the fucking noise down?

32:58.185 --> 33:00.938
Fucko, I'll stick that thing
up your fucking arse!

33:02.981 --> 33:04.858
Right, you fucker!

33:13.325 --> 33:15.123
Oi, silly cunt!

33:18.622 --> 33:21.091
Samuel, get away from there!

33:22.042 --> 33:24.465
Can you not fucking hear me, hey?

33:24.586 --> 33:26.384
I told you to stop making a racket!

33:26.505 --> 33:28.883
Banging that shed
like Captain fucking Caveman!

33:30.634 --> 33:34.980
Man, do that once more, and I swear
I'll let this fucker off the leash!

33:35.096 --> 33:37.349
It'll rip your fucking throat out!

33:44.439 --> 33:46.567
(Dog barks)

33:53.573 --> 33:55.951
- He's a beautiful dog.
- Aye.

33:56.076 --> 33:59.250
You won't be saying that when
he's hanging off your fucking face!

34:01.248 --> 34:02.750
It's not your fault, buddy.

34:02.874 --> 34:06.174
(Growls and barks)

34:06.294 --> 34:08.170
It's not your fault.

34:17.681 --> 34:19.183
There's a good boy!

34:22.561 --> 34:24.655
You fucking pussy!

34:26.022 --> 34:28.195
Sam, I've told you!

34:28.315 --> 34:30.864
You, stay away
from that weird bastard!

34:30.985 --> 34:32.454
I fucking told you!

34:32.571 --> 34:36.417
- Get in there.
- (Woman) Hurry up.

34:38.118 --> 34:39.585
Get in!

34:42.871 --> 34:46.547
There's these fresh lovely flowers
that they planted in the park.

34:46.668 --> 34:49.217
Some sort of mural they were making.

34:49.838 --> 34:53.342
Welcome to Buckingham.
Fuckingham!

34:53.466 --> 34:54.934
(Laughs)

34:55.051 --> 34:59.147
Welcome to Fuckingham Palace.
It was for the Queen's visit, yeah?

34:59.264 --> 35:01.687
The thing is, Joseph,

35:01.808 --> 35:05.358
they stopped the fucking buses
on account of that cow.

35:05.478 --> 35:10.029
That's my mode of transportation.
My A to fucking B.

35:10.150 --> 35:12.903
I missed Superman because of her.

35:13.028 --> 35:16.498
My little boy is crying his eyes out.
I promised him the Man of Steel.

35:16.615 --> 35:20.040
He says to me, "Fuck the Queen.
I want to see Superman.

35:20.160 --> 35:22.504
"I want to see the Man of Steel."

35:22.621 --> 35:26.216
"Fuck the Queen," says he.
My own boy. Paddy.

35:26.333 --> 35:27.755
(Laughs)

35:27.876 --> 35:30.049
Fuck the Queen!
I nearly would at this stage.

35:30.170 --> 35:33.219
Jesus Christ!
It's an awful state of affairs.

35:35.216 --> 35:36.684
It's dog all together.

35:38.303 --> 35:39.725
It's dog.

35:46.227 --> 35:48.480
- Good night!
- Bye, mate.

35:52.692 --> 35:55.320
Don't say good night to me
whatever you do.

35:56.905 --> 35:58.748
Freedom!

36:02.160 --> 36:05.710
(Tommy) Good night, Joseph,
you fucking bastard.

36:08.041 --> 36:09.759
(Laughter)

36:17.050 --> 36:19.929
(Shouts) Oi, you cunts! I'm here!

36:20.053 --> 36:22.147
(Mutters)

37:35.962 --> 37:37.464
What happened to you?

37:37.589 --> 37:40.843
I fell over. I forgot to put
the mat down in the bath.

37:46.097 --> 37:48.191
Sorry. Did you want to say something?

37:49.309 --> 37:52.688
- I thought I might say something.
- What?

37:54.481 --> 37:55.903
Doesn't matter.

37:56.024 --> 37:59.278
What, you haven't come to rage at me?
Swear at me? Depress me?

37:59.402 --> 38:02.531
Question my beliefs?
Make assumptions about my cosy life?

38:02.655 --> 38:07.001
- No.
- Well, that's kind of you. Bye.

38:27.180 --> 38:29.274
(Sobs)

38:47.534 --> 38:50.128
(Shop bell rings)

38:50.245 --> 38:52.088
- (Woman) Morning!
- Hi!

38:58.336 --> 38:59.804
Hey! Hello!

38:59.921 --> 39:02.299
Oh, Hannah love,
what happened to you?

39:02.423 --> 39:04.050
I slipped over in the bath.

39:04.175 --> 39:05.973
Oh, silly you! It looks sore.

39:06.094 --> 39:08.563
It is. It is sore.
But it looks worse than it is.

39:08.680 --> 39:11.980
- You need a bath mat, love.
- Good idea!

39:12.100 --> 39:15.730
- Adults in here. Kids in here.
- Brilliant. Thank you so much.

39:15.854 --> 39:18.403
- You take care.
- Yes, I will. I promise.

39:18.523 --> 39:20.321
- See you soon.
- Lovely to see you.

39:20.441 --> 39:22.569
- Bye.
- Bye.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.470
(Knocks on door)

39:50.388 --> 39:51.981
He's gone, Joseph.

40:03.943 --> 40:06.037
(Banging)

40:19.918 --> 40:21.386
Joseph!

40:23.212 --> 40:25.715
Please, Joseph!
He'll get the dog on you!

40:25.840 --> 40:29.140
Joseph!
He'll get the dog on you, man!

40:30.303 --> 40:31.771
Please!

40:33.306 --> 40:36.981
Look, I know you're sad,
but, please! He'll kill us both!

41:45.503 --> 41:49.133
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Hannah.

41:52.260 --> 41:54.558
I don't know what happened to me.

41:58.224 --> 42:00.272
I don't know what's wrong with me.

42:02.228 --> 42:04.151
I'm ill, Hannah.

42:08.026 --> 42:09.494
I don't deserve you.

42:09.610 --> 42:13.535
It's OK. It's OK.
I'm here for you. I forgive you.

42:13.656 --> 42:17.206
I pray to God,
but he doesn't hear me.

42:17.326 --> 42:21.456
- It's OK.
- And I can't take it any more.

42:21.581 --> 42:23.959
It's OK. I'm here for you.

42:24.083 --> 42:27.007
(Sobs)

42:27.128 --> 42:31.304
I'll keep praying...Hannah.

42:31.424 --> 42:35.804
I'll just keep praying...
because it's not the real me.

42:35.928 --> 42:39.398
- It's not. It's not the real you.
- Do you remember the real me?

42:39.515 --> 42:42.815
Yeah, I remember the real you.
It's OK. I pray for you.

42:42.935 --> 42:45.563
- I'll pray for you, James.
- You'll pray for me?

42:47.190 --> 42:49.693
I don't deserve you.

42:49.817 --> 42:54.243
- And I do love you so much.
- It's OK. I'm here for you. It's OK.

42:54.363 --> 42:56.616
- I don't deserve you.
- It's OK.

42:56.741 --> 42:58.789
(Continues to sob)

43:02.538 --> 43:05.382
- I love you so much.
- I love you too.

43:08.669 --> 43:10.296
I love you.

43:11.964 --> 43:13.557
I love you.

43:17.136 --> 43:18.809
It's OK.

43:27.730 --> 43:29.152
(Shop bell rings)

43:39.158 --> 43:40.831
My friend died yesterday.

43:42.078 --> 43:44.172
Oh, I'm sorry.

43:47.083 --> 43:51.008
- I miss the cunt.
- I'm sure he misses you too.

43:55.216 --> 43:56.718
Who hit you?

43:59.178 --> 44:00.851
I had a fall.

44:07.728 --> 44:09.856
Anyway, I need a suit
for the funeral.

44:11.065 --> 44:14.239
Wondered if you had something
that might fit.

44:14.360 --> 44:17.113
Yeah, we've got a couple of suits
you can give a go.

44:25.204 --> 44:28.083
- What do you think?
- It looks very smart.

44:28.207 --> 44:29.925
Aye?

44:30.042 --> 44:32.386
Trousers are a bit big, but fuck it.

44:33.796 --> 44:35.594
- Can I use your mirror?
- Yeah.

44:39.510 --> 44:44.016
Oh, aye?
Still a handsome bastard.

44:44.140 --> 44:46.313
You are.
This will finish it off nicely...

44:46.434 --> 44:48.107
- Hey-
- Sorry...

44:50.980 --> 44:54.325
No, I'm... I'm sorry. Go ahead.

44:54.442 --> 44:56.615
- Go ahead, go ahead.
- Right.

45:13.920 --> 45:15.422
(Shop bell rings)

45:20.134 --> 45:21.636
Hey!

45:24.305 --> 45:25.898
Hi, Hannah.

45:26.015 --> 45:27.437
<i>Hey...</i>

45:27.558 --> 45:29.811
- How's your day?
- Yeah, good.

45:29.936 --> 45:33.531
This is Joseph. His friend's died.
I'm helping him to get a suit.

45:33.648 --> 45:35.150
Sorry to hear that.

45:37.735 --> 45:39.829
Yeah, when was the funeral, Joseph?

45:40.780 --> 45:43.659
- Wednesday, I think.
- Well, you'd better make sure.

45:45.284 --> 45:48.163
Don't want to turn up
on the wrong day!

45:56.671 --> 45:59.049
- I'll change in there, eh?
- Yeah. Great.

46:01.801 --> 46:04.850
Hey, how was your morning? What?

46:08.391 --> 46:10.894
- I saw you.
- You saw me what?

46:13.437 --> 46:16.156
- What does that mean?
- I'll talk to you later.

46:16.274 --> 46:18.276
(Whispers) You fucking slag!

46:18.401 --> 46:21.905
I haven't done anything.
It's not like that.

46:27.326 --> 46:28.999
(Sighs)

46:31.831 --> 46:33.253
You OK?

46:34.250 --> 46:36.548
Yeah. Sorry.
Could you leave, please?

46:56.022 --> 46:58.116
(Wails)

47:01.444 --> 47:04.948
What are you fucking looking at?
Fuck you!

47:12.621 --> 47:14.373
(Music plays in bar)

47:23.966 --> 47:25.343
(Ringtone)

47:25.468 --> 47:28.517
'Hello. Neither I nor James can
come to the phone right now.

47:28.637 --> 47:30.139
'Please leave a message.'

47:30.264 --> 47:35.065
James, I didn't do anything.
Please pick up the phone.

47:35.186 --> 47:37.063
Can I get a gin and tonic, please?

47:45.613 --> 47:46.785
'Hello. Neither I nor James...'

47:46.906 --> 47:50.752
James, it's Hannah. Please listen.
I didn't do anything wrong.

47:50.868 --> 47:52.415
It's not what you think.

48:05.257 --> 48:08.477
James, it's Hannah.
Please pick up the phone.

48:08.594 --> 48:13.065
I want to explain to you.
Please pick up the phone!

48:14.058 --> 48:15.480
Pick up the phone.

48:15.601 --> 48:18.104
(James) 'Hello? Hello?'

48:18.229 --> 48:20.482
Please don't hurt me any more,
James.

48:20.606 --> 48:23.234
'Where are you? Hannah?'

48:24.068 --> 48:26.162
I don't want you to hurt me any more.

48:26.278 --> 48:30.454
'Are you drunk? Where are you?
Tell me where you are.'

48:31.617 --> 48:34.040
Don't hurt me any more.

48:34.161 --> 48:37.461
'Hannah? Hannah?'

48:41.127 --> 48:43.380
- Hello?
- 'You with my wife? Where are you?'

48:43.504 --> 48:47.930
We're just at the...
We're just at the Exchange now.

48:48.050 --> 48:49.518
Yeah. She's on the floor.

48:49.635 --> 48:53.310
Come on.
You'll get piles sitting there!

48:55.141 --> 48:56.768
- That's it.
- Come on.

48:59.270 --> 49:00.692
There we are.

49:06.986 --> 49:10.707
- Hey, that looks posh.
- Do you think he'll give us a lift?

49:12.533 --> 49:15.286
- He's here now.
- You go home.

49:15.411 --> 49:17.459
You'll be home soon.

49:17.580 --> 49:21.050
You'll be home soon. Hi!

49:21.167 --> 49:22.635
- Thank you.
- Hiya.

49:22.751 --> 49:25.721
- She's good.
- Bye, love.

49:25.838 --> 49:28.182
- See ya.
- It's OK. All right.

49:35.973 --> 49:37.691
Watch your head.

50:22.978 --> 50:26.357
I'm going to stick you!
You fucking slag!

50:28.317 --> 50:30.035
What's so funny?

50:30.152 --> 50:32.826
- You been out selling your fanny?
- Yeah.

50:35.032 --> 50:38.036
- What?
- Yeah, I've been selling my fanny.

50:38.953 --> 50:43.049
I need all the men I can fuck,
because you're a useless bastard.

50:43.165 --> 50:45.634
And I can't stand
the sight of you any more.

50:45.751 --> 50:47.674
You're a little fucking coward!

50:47.795 --> 50:50.389
Pretends he believes in God
and is ill in the head.

50:50.506 --> 50:53.931
You're an evil little boy with
an evil little cock. Go on! Hit me!

50:54.051 --> 50:57.021
Go on! Right on the chin!
Bruise me up some more!

50:57.137 --> 50:59.390
Bruise my whole fucking head!
Come on!

50:59.515 --> 51:02.439
Want to smell my fanny?
You normally do, don't you?

51:02.560 --> 51:07.441
I fucking hate you! Get off me!
I fucking hate you!

51:08.816 --> 51:10.318
Hate you!

51:10.442 --> 51:12.490
(Pants)

51:28.794 --> 51:30.842
(Laughs hysterically)

51:58.282 --> 52:02.128
Evil little cock, huh?
Evil little cock, hey?

52:02.244 --> 52:07.045
How about I just slice your tits off
and stick them on the wall, hey?

52:07.166 --> 52:11.296
I gave you a chance, Hannah.
I gave you a fucking chance!

52:11.420 --> 52:14.344
I gave you a chance
and you fucked it up!

52:18.385 --> 52:20.479
(James pants heavily)

52:23.974 --> 52:27.979

52:52.211 --> 52:53.633
(Screams)

53:49.935 --> 53:53.656
- Can I help you, love?
- Yeah, I'm looking for Joseph.

53:53.772 --> 53:55.240
Joseph?

53:55.357 --> 53:58.156
Yes, I came here with him
to pray for your father.

54:01.613 --> 54:03.661
Erm...come in.

54:10.289 --> 54:11.962
Where is he now?

54:12.583 --> 54:14.005
(Hannah) I've left him.

54:17.713 --> 54:21.308
You have any family or friends
or someone you can go to?

54:22.801 --> 54:24.474
They won't believe me.

54:26.054 --> 54:27.977
They think he's perfect.

54:29.725 --> 54:33.650
I'd say there was enough evidence
on your face to suggest otherwise.

54:37.107 --> 54:39.030
I don't have anybody.

54:50.829 --> 54:52.331
Marie...

54:53.999 --> 54:55.876
(Whispers) What do I do with her?

55:02.132 --> 55:04.134
Does it bring back memories, Joseph?

55:26.365 --> 55:29.414
- All right, Sam?
- Where have you been, man?

55:29.535 --> 55:31.253
I've been around, son.

55:31.370 --> 55:33.043
Is this your girlfriend?

55:34.706 --> 55:38.176
- This is Hannah.
- Whoa! What happened to you, girl?

55:38.293 --> 55:40.170
Would you believe,
she fell off a bus.

55:41.088 --> 55:43.887
- What? From top?
- Aye.

55:44.007 --> 55:46.760
Oh, that's bad luck.

55:46.885 --> 55:48.603
I hope she's all right.

55:48.720 --> 55:52.065
- See ya.
- See ya, fella.

55:57.104 --> 55:58.572
Come on through.

56:08.574 --> 56:10.076
Grab a seat.

56:15.914 --> 56:17.587
Can I get you something?

56:18.750 --> 56:21.469
- Do you have any aspirin?
- Yeah.

56:21.587 --> 56:25.012
I can get you something stronger,
but it might knock you out.

56:25.132 --> 56:26.600
Aspirin would be great.

56:26.717 --> 56:28.811
- Want a tea?
- Yes, please.

56:28.927 --> 56:30.975
- What do you take?
- Just milk.

56:49.364 --> 56:51.742
- Just milk, yeah?
- Yes, please.

57:06.298 --> 57:08.972
Who's the woman in the picture there?

57:09.092 --> 57:13.142
- That's the wife.
- She's got a lovely face.

57:14.973 --> 57:16.646
Yeah. She did have.

57:18.018 --> 57:19.645
She was a good woman.

57:20.270 --> 57:22.523
She's dead, is she?

57:22.648 --> 57:24.150
Five years now.

57:26.318 --> 57:28.787
How did she die?
If it's all right to ask.

57:28.904 --> 57:30.531
Sorry, I'm prying

57:30.656 --> 57:32.704
Heart attack.

57:32.824 --> 57:34.667
She was diabetic.

57:37.204 --> 57:39.548
She was always a big girl,

57:39.665 --> 57:42.839
but she would not stop
eating the shit that was killing her.

57:45.003 --> 57:46.801
In the end, they cut off her legs.

57:46.922 --> 57:49.846
She was fucking blind.
She was just a carcass.

57:52.386 --> 57:54.684
(Dogs barking outside)

57:56.932 --> 57:58.525
The Tyrannosaur.

58:00.602 --> 58:02.479
Sorry. What did you say?

58:02.604 --> 58:04.948
Fucking dogs
are driving me fucking nuts!

58:05.065 --> 58:08.239
Can you hear that barking?
It's fucking killing me!

58:08.360 --> 58:09.953
What are you doing?

58:20.789 --> 58:22.883
(Heavy footsteps thud above)

59:26.271 --> 59:27.739
(Hannah) Oh, sorry!

59:54.174 --> 59:55.721
Morning.

59:57.302 --> 01:00:00.647
- You can't stay here.
- OK.

01:00:02.516 --> 01:00:06.191
I can't cope.
Can't cope with someone in the house.

01:00:07.938 --> 01:00:12.409
You brought your shite to my door
and I don't want it. I'm no Samaritan.

01:00:12.526 --> 01:00:14.028
Right.

01:00:14.152 --> 01:00:15.870
It's nothing personal.

01:00:15.987 --> 01:00:19.332
I'm trying to turn my life around
and you're fucking it up.

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:22.953
Now, if you want help to go and get
some gear, then I'll help you.

01:00:23.078 --> 01:00:25.627
But if your old man's gonna
keep bartering the fuck out of you,

01:00:25.747 --> 01:00:28.216
go to family or friends
or your Christian buddies.

01:00:28.333 --> 01:00:32.213
- You've no business with me.
- I understand.

01:00:32.337 --> 01:00:35.090
I'll take you home
and I'll help you get some gear.

01:00:35.215 --> 01:00:37.343
After that, we're done.

01:00:38.176 --> 01:00:39.598
Yeah.

01:01:02.117 --> 01:01:03.585
Is it this one?

01:01:06.496 --> 01:01:08.874
- Right, come on.
- Erm...

01:01:11.418 --> 01:01:13.796
- Hannah, come on.
- I'm not ready.

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.638
- I'm not ready.
- It's OK.

01:01:15.755 --> 01:01:18.133
- Look, I'll go in. I'll sort it.
- No, I can't!

01:01:18.258 --> 01:01:20.260
- Hannah, I'll sort it.
- No.

01:01:20.385 --> 01:01:22.808
- Come on. Hannah!
- No!

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:33.068
Hannah!

01:02:00.342 --> 01:02:02.310
- How's it going?
- How did you get on?

01:02:02.427 --> 01:02:05.397
- I think I did OK, Captain.
- Superb.

01:02:05.513 --> 01:02:07.015
How much do I owe you?

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:09.734
Do I look like the Chancellor
of the fucking Exchequer?

01:02:09.851 --> 01:02:12.821
There's no fucking way!
I help my buddy, yeah?

01:02:12.938 --> 01:02:14.986
And the lady? Damsel in distress.

01:02:15.106 --> 01:02:17.950
OK, you're a good man.
You're a good man. I'll see you.

01:02:19.319 --> 01:02:20.992
OK, what we got?

01:02:21.112 --> 01:02:22.989
- Shirt.
- Great.

01:02:23.114 --> 01:02:24.832
- Thank you.
- It's all right.

01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:26.623

01:02:26.743 --> 01:02:30.998
Yeah. Jeans. Your size?

01:02:31.122 --> 01:02:32.590
- Hm.
- OK. Good.

01:02:32.707 --> 01:02:34.880
I could have bought them myself.
I have some money.

01:02:35.001 --> 01:02:37.003
No, it's fine. It's fine, it's fine.

01:02:37.128 --> 01:02:39.130
Here. Summery, eh?

01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:45.224
Hair. Is that hair?

01:02:45.345 --> 01:02:47.097
- Hair bands.
- Hair bands.

01:02:47.222 --> 01:02:49.896
- I don't really have hair.
- OK. What else we got?

01:02:51.309 --> 01:02:54.438
Ah, he's a fucking wank... Sorry.
It's Tommy.

01:02:54.562 --> 01:02:56.985

- You want a cup of tea?
- Yes, please.

01:10:13.084 --> 01:10:14.882
How's your head?

01:10:15.002 --> 01:10:17.755
It's not great. I'll survive.

01:10:18.673 --> 01:10:20.801
- Just milk?
- Mm. Yes, please.

01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:46.414
(indistinct chatter)

01:10:48.661 --> 01:10:53.633
- We'll fix it or get you another.
- He's my bunny. I want to keep it.

01:10:56.377 --> 01:10:58.926
(Woman) Sam, I'm sorry.

01:10:59.046 --> 01:11:01.014
(Hannah) Why Tyrannosaur?

01:11:03.718 --> 01:11:05.220
What?

01:11:05.344 --> 01:11:08.564
About your wife.
Tyrannosaurus or something?

01:11:11.642 --> 01:11:13.986
Oh, Tyranno... Right, yeah.

01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:19.826
It was...
It was just a joke. A joke name.

01:11:20.985 --> 01:11:24.159
Seen 'Jurassic Park'?
You know, the movie?

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:26.874
Do you remember
there's a scene in the car,

01:11:26.991 --> 01:11:30.120
the kids are scared
and they're looking at the glass

01:11:30.244 --> 01:11:32.463
and you hear the Tyrannosaur coming?

01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:36.881
As it thumps its way towards them,
the glass starts to ripple.

01:11:39.504 --> 01:11:44.726
So, my wife was a big lady.
You'd hear her going up the stairs.

01:11:44.842 --> 01:11:47.812
And it was like
boom, boom, boom, boom.

01:11:47.929 --> 01:11:50.648
And I swear if I put a cup of tea
on the sideboard,

01:11:50.765 --> 01:11:54.360
you'd see the same ripples in my tea.

01:11:54.477 --> 01:11:56.525
So I called her the Tyrannosaur.

01:11:57.772 --> 01:11:59.490
I thought it was funny.

01:12:00.691 --> 01:12:02.318
I was being a cunt.

01:12:05.196 --> 01:12:08.325
- Did you love her?
- Mm-hm.

01:12:11.410 --> 01:12:13.162
And I hated her as well.

01:12:15.289 --> 01:12:16.962
She was a simple lady.

01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:21.296
Had this naive faith in people.

01:12:23.130 --> 01:12:26.976
Would forgive anyone for anything.
Used to drive me fucking nuts.

01:12:28.261 --> 01:12:31.265
So full of forgiveness and love...

01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:35.526
And I stomped the love out of her.

01:12:38.729 --> 01:12:40.276
I'm not proud of it.

01:12:44.402 --> 01:12:46.245
I thought she was dumb.

01:12:46.362 --> 01:12:48.581
But she wasn't. She was beautiful.

01:12:52.577 --> 01:12:55.797
- Do you wish she was still here now?
- No.

01:12:57.373 --> 01:13:00.593
- I'd still treat her like a dog.
- Why?

01:13:02.753 --> 01:13:05.006
Cos I'm not a nice human being.

01:13:07.758 --> 01:13:10.853
I don't agree.
I think you're a good person.

01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:13.064
You don't know anything, girl.

01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:14.682
I feel safe with you.

01:13:14.807 --> 01:13:17.105
Nobody's safe with me.

01:14:41.936 --> 01:14:44.030
(Doorbell rings)

01:16:21.368 --> 01:16:23.041
(Gasps)

01:17:43.033 --> 01:17:46.833
Hey there! How you doing?
Hope you don't mind.

01:17:46.954 --> 01:17:48.547
I wanted to cook something for you

01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:51.543
to say thank you
for looking after me.

01:17:52.251 --> 01:17:54.674
And, erm, I've got something in here.

01:18:12.897 --> 01:18:16.242
Just to brighten the place up a bit
and to say thank you.

01:18:18.527 --> 01:18:20.495
Are you OK?

01:18:22.406 --> 01:18:26.252
Sorry. I didn't want to force it on you.
I just wanted to say thanks.

01:18:29.788 --> 01:18:31.461
You're fucked.

01:18:32.333 --> 01:18:34.051
Sorry?

01:18:35.252 --> 01:18:39.473
I took your keys.
I went to your house.

01:18:40.841 --> 01:18:42.843
I wanted to sort this shit out.

01:18:45.763 --> 01:18:47.310
I saw him.

01:18:50.267 --> 01:18:54.443
Yeah. Was he there? What did he say?

01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:58.067
A load of lies.
Did he lay on the charm?

01:19:00.027 --> 01:19:01.950
What have you done, girl?

01:19:06.367 --> 01:19:09.086
What...what's wrong?

01:19:12.206 --> 01:19:14.425
What are you looking at?

01:19:14.541 --> 01:19:19.012
Who the fuck are you to judge me?
You know nothing about me!

01:19:19.129 --> 01:19:22.099
You don't know
what that bastard did to me!

01:19:26.053 --> 01:19:27.896
(Screams)

01:19:34.144 --> 01:19:37.774
He... He raped me.

01:19:41.819 --> 01:19:43.617
Oh, God...

01:19:44.446 --> 01:19:46.619
He put things inside me.

01:19:48.075 --> 01:19:51.079
He put glass inside me.

01:19:54.873 --> 01:19:58.798
I wanted to have babies.

01:19:58.919 --> 01:20:04.392
All I wanted was to have babies
and to be a mummy.

01:20:08.804 --> 01:20:12.354
Oh, God! Help!

01:20:25.112 --> 01:20:27.365
Please help.

01:20:28.449 --> 01:20:30.247
Will you hold me?

01:20:35.205 --> 01:20:37.299
Will you hold me, please?

01:20:42.046 --> 01:20:43.548
No...

01:20:45.966 --> 01:20:50.142
