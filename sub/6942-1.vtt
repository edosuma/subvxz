00:21.955 --> 00:23.822
                 My rocket ship
                 needed to fly.

00:23.823 --> 00:27.176
You put orange paint all over
your classroom wall, Caleb.

00:27.177 --> 00:29.494
             Dad says rocket's
             we're non-boosters.

00:29.495 --> 00:33.331
     And flames shoot out
     and lift it into the air.

00:33.332 --> 00:34.833
Okay, listen sweetie,

00:34.834 --> 00:37.603
when you're staying at daddy's
paint all the flames you want,

00:37.604 --> 00:40.172
but anywhere else it's
 considered vandalism.

00:40.173 --> 00:42.274
             You just don't
             believe in flying.

00:42.275 --> 00:44.777
You're right. I don't.
We don't live in the air,

00:44.778 --> 00:47.980
we live on the ground and on
the ground we behave better.

00:54.237 --> 00:58.023
Come on, Uncle Owen's
expecting us.

00:58.024 --> 00:59.875
 We're gonna bring him
some Christmas spirit.

01:04.798 --> 01:06.665
                         Hey!

01:06.666 --> 01:09.001
         I thought you guys were
         coming over earlier.

01:09.002 --> 01:11.637
Ugh, someone
threatened his status

01:11.638 --> 01:13.922
on Santa's nice list
at school today.

01:13.923 --> 01:16.041
     Is that true little man?

01:16.042 --> 01:17.593
     Santa won't find out.

01:17.594 --> 01:19.945
                 Uh, Santa knows
                 everything.

01:19.946 --> 01:20.896
             How?

01:20.897 --> 01:22.648
                         Magic.

01:22.649 --> 01:24.016
            Magic?

01:24.017 --> 01:26.351
                 Yeah, you don't
                 believe me?

01:26.352 --> 01:27.519
                 Go look it up.

01:27.520 --> 01:29.721
                 Encyclopedia's
                 on the shelf.

01:32.492 --> 01:34.943
         (sigh) You don't have
         to decorate sis.

01:34.944 --> 01:37.362
         Yes I do,
     because you won't.

01:37.363 --> 01:39.748
     It'll do you good to
     be a little festive.

01:40.250 --> 01:42.117
(laughs)

01:42.118 --> 01:43.252
            Oh wow.

01:43.253 --> 01:44.569
You remember this?

01:44.570 --> 01:46.922
     Of course, this is
     my robo-reindeer.

01:46.923 --> 01:50.592
A robot reindeer with lunchboxes
and an animated special.

01:50.593 --> 01:52.377
     (robot voice) "What's
    your name space cadet?"

01:52.378 --> 01:55.347
        "And what's you
     major malfunction?"

01:55.348 --> 01:59.751
     Here, you could definitely
     use a little of this.

01:59.752 --> 02:02.437
Oh, pot kettle black.

02:02.438 --> 02:04.973
                 I'm fine thank
                 you very much.

02:04.974 --> 02:07.693
You got divorced,
not ordained.

02:07.694 --> 02:10.262
Don't you think it's time
you get back out there?

02:10.263 --> 02:13.765
 Look, I'm good at a lot of
 things, being a mom, a vet...

02:13.766 --> 02:17.319
             But love, love I'm
             just not good at.

02:17.320 --> 02:19.437
Well sometimes you
have to take risks.

02:19.438 --> 02:22.624
     Like you live life on the
     edge Mr. Achy Breaky Heart.

02:22.625 --> 02:24.459
             Eh.

02:24.460 --> 02:27.830

02:29.966 --> 02:32.384
Well maybe you just need
to change the station.

02:33.386 --> 02:34.786
Whoa!

02:34.787 --> 02:37.756
Uncle Owen, will you go with me
to the father-son football game?

02:37.757 --> 02:39.308
Your dad can't
make it buddy?

02:39.309 --> 02:40.893
         He's flying.

02:40.894 --> 02:43.128
 Holiday's are the busiest
 time of year for pilots.

02:43.129 --> 02:44.146
Of course little man.

02:44.147 --> 02:45.097
I'm there.

02:47.767 --> 02:48.767
                     Thank you.

02:48.768 --> 02:49.651
Come on.

02:49.652 --> 02:51.687
Let's help your
mom decorate.

02:51.688 --> 02:53.655
        You would pick
     out the old lights,

02:53.656 --> 02:55.657
        those probably
     don't even work.

02:55.658 --> 02:58.243
         You have to
        take a chance.

02:58.244 --> 03:00.112
        How do you know
     they won't work?

03:00.113 --> 03:01.613
         (laughs)

03:01.614 --> 03:03.782
        Unless you try.

03:03.783 --> 03:06.118
 Just need a little magic,
         that's all.

03:06.119 --> 03:07.485
     More like a miracle.

03:08.254 --> 03:10.172
Ohhh!

03:10.173 --> 03:11.423
Ho, ho!

03:11.424 --> 03:13.842
Magic.

03:13.843 --> 03:17.662
         See mommy,
     you just have to try.

03:17.663 --> 03:19.497
You just have to try.

03:52.298 --> 03:55.300
     Well our re-introduction of
     robo-reindeer was the most

03:55.301 --> 03:58.637
     successful ad campaign in
     the agencies history.

03:58.638 --> 04:01.139
     We deserve to celebrate.

04:01.140 --> 04:03.308
Wait a second.

04:06.980 --> 04:10.515
"What's your name,
Space Cadet?"

04:10.516 --> 04:11.767
             Sean.

04:11.768 --> 04:15.520
"Hi Sean. Will you come with
me to Santa's Space Base?"

04:15.521 --> 04:19.074
    I love that we put the
    North Pole on the moon.

04:19.075 --> 04:20.692
                 It's something
                 all right.

04:20.692 --> 04:22.945
No, this is something.

04:26.165 --> 04:27.699
                You're proposing
                to Kimber?

04:27.700 --> 04:28.834
Open it up!

04:30.620 --> 04:31.803
                         Wow.

04:31.804 --> 04:33.088
                    When are you
                    proposing?

04:33.089 --> 04:34.039
Christmas.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.590
I have it all planned.

04:35.591 --> 04:38.427
     Why wait a couple of weeks?
     You should do it tonight.

04:38.428 --> 04:40.578
             So we can all gush
             and celebrate more.

04:42.265 --> 04:43.715
     Hey, sweetheart!

04:44.350 --> 04:45.350
                         Kimber!

             Mia!

04:50.473 --> 04:51.974
How was your day?

04:51.975 --> 04:55.477
 Same as always, another
 fun-filled day on Wall Street.

04:55.478 --> 04:56.778
                         Yours?

04:56.779 --> 04:57.896
Great.

04:57.897 --> 05:00.649
Our robo-reindeer campaign
is a huge success.

05:00.650 --> 05:01.766
             Congratulations.

05:01.767 --> 05:04.619
            Thanks.

05:04.620 --> 05:05.654
         You okay?

05:06.823 --> 05:09.107
         It's been a rough day.

05:09.108 --> 05:12.327
You know, I was gonna
wait to do this but,

05:12.328 --> 05:14.329
I want to talk to
you about us.

05:14.330 --> 05:16.164
             I know what you're
             gonna say.

05:16.165 --> 05:18.133
You do?

05:18.134 --> 05:20.886
         We should take a break.

05:22.000 --> 05:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:31.264 --> 05:34.900
         Let's go talk
         in my office.

05:43.943 --> 05:45.110
     What are you saying?

05:46.446 --> 05:48.847
We've gone stale.

05:48.848 --> 05:51.950
I act bored
because I am.

05:51.951 --> 05:54.819
I guess that's why when Larry
Fitz Gilbert asked me out,

05:54.820 --> 05:56.488
I couldn't say no.

05:56.489 --> 05:58.957
Nothing happened, but
there's an attraction there

05:58.958 --> 06:01.126
and it's thrilling.

06:01.127 --> 06:03.161
I haven't felt that
way in so long.

06:03.162 --> 06:04.162
                     Back up!

06:04.163 --> 06:06.164
             Larry Fitz Gilbert?

06:06.165 --> 06:08.133
                 The bowtie guy?

06:08.134 --> 06:09.301
                 He's engaged.

06:09.302 --> 06:10.335
They're on a break.

06:10.336 --> 06:12.804
                     Whatever!

06:12.805 --> 06:14.839
You haven't noticed our
relationship has crumbled.

06:14.840 --> 06:15.857
             No.

06:15.858 --> 06:17.609
        I envisioned a
     future with you.

06:20.813 --> 06:22.180
(sighs)

06:22.181 --> 06:25.450
Oh no, Sean.

06:25.451 --> 06:26.118
Is that?

06:26.119 --> 06:27.352
             Was.

06:27.353 --> 06:29.621
     Larry Fitz Gilbert
     kinda changes things.

06:31.290 --> 06:33.191
    How did I not see this?

06:33.192 --> 06:35.460
Because, Sean,
you're never present.

06:35.461 --> 06:37.462
     I'm standing right here.

06:37.463 --> 06:40.082
Yes physically, but mentally
you're always looking

06:40.083 --> 06:43.168
to the future and neglecting
what's happening now.

06:43.169 --> 06:45.303
Including us.

06:45.304 --> 06:49.508
We haven't been happy,
really happy in a while.

06:49.509 --> 06:51.760
                 All you had to
                 do was tell me.

06:51.761 --> 06:53.845
I've been trying, but
again you're too busy

06:53.846 --> 06:56.314
planning the future.

06:56.315 --> 06:58.883
You're like the human
version of tomorrow land.

06:58.884 --> 07:01.319
            I own an advertising
            agency.

07:01.320 --> 07:02.854
                 Coming up with
                 the next trend,

07:02.855 --> 07:05.690
     staying ahead of the game
     is part of the job.

07:05.691 --> 07:07.409
Yeah, well that doesn't
work in relationships.

07:07.410 --> 07:09.694
Which is why we need
to take a break

07:09.695 --> 07:12.230
so we can re-evaluate
this relationship.

07:15.585 --> 07:17.619
             <i>Larry Fitz Gilbert.</i>

07:17.620 --> 07:21.289
He's spontaneous, exciting,
and we have a connection.

07:21.290 --> 07:22.624
             I'm sure you do.

07:22.625 --> 07:24.259
Let's just take
some time off.

07:27.213 --> 07:28.847
     Well that doesn't
     sound promising.

07:28.848 --> 07:30.415
At least for now.

07:31.601 --> 07:34.752
I really hope you have
a Merry Christmas.

07:34.753 --> 07:37.022
        Well, Christmas
     is two weeks away.

07:37.023 --> 07:39.307
     We wouldn't wanna get
     ahead of ourselves.

07:46.765 --> 07:48.316
            (slam)

07:48.317 --> 07:50.602
     What's your major
     malfunction, Sean?

07:57.043 --> 08:00.778
 Hey Chappy. Man, it feels
 like the North Pole in here.

08:00.779 --> 08:01.880
                         Yeah.

08:01.881 --> 08:03.999
     You guys sell toys?

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
                 That's funny.

08:05.001 --> 08:06.001
                     Real funny.

08:06.002 --> 08:08.420
                 I haven't heard
                 that one today.

08:08.421 --> 08:09.971
             Boiler's busted.

08:09.972 --> 08:12.090
         Courtney's been trying
         to fix it all morning.

08:12.091 --> 08:13.842
Why didn't
she call me?

08:13.843 --> 08:17.479
     I think she feels weird,
     with your history and all.

08:17.480 --> 08:20.315
         You wanna melt this
         iceberg, be my guest.

08:30.943 --> 08:33.361
            Looks like you could
            use some help.

08:33.361 --> 08:35.996
Hey, Owen.

08:35.998 --> 08:39.150
God am I happy
to see you.

08:39.150 --> 08:40.034
                     All right.

08:40.035 --> 08:41.503
It must of busted
last night.

08:41.504 --> 08:44.789
It was like a meat locker in
here when I opened this morning.

08:44.790 --> 08:47.259
Killing my business.

08:47.260 --> 08:50.011
    You know you can call me for
    things like this, right?

08:50.012 --> 08:52.514
Yeah, I know,
I just uh...

08:52.515 --> 08:55.016
I just didn't
wanna bother you.

08:55.017 --> 08:58.336
                I'm a repairman,
                it's my job.

08:58.337 --> 08:59.437
Yeah...

09:00.673 --> 09:04.359
 I know it's just, since
we broke up I thought...

09:05.528 --> 09:07.112
             It was eight months
             ago Courtney,

09:07.113 --> 09:08.446
                 I'm an adult.

09:08.447 --> 09:11.449
Our break-up didn't stop me
from getting coffee here did it?

09:11.450 --> 09:13.351
Well it's the best
coffee in town.

09:13.352 --> 09:15.120
         That's not the point.

09:21.043 --> 09:22.794

09:25.364 --> 09:26.881
You're the best!

09:31.170 --> 09:32.304
Thank you.

09:33.839 --> 09:35.307
What do I owe you?

09:36.842 --> 09:39.144
         How about having dinner
         with me tonight.

10:40.272 --> 10:42.106
         You've been dating for
         maybe three months

10:42.107 --> 10:43.107

10:45.611 --> 10:48.163
Obviously, I'm moving
out there to be with him.

10:48.164 --> 10:50.081
Chappy's taking
over for me.

10:51.784 --> 10:55.003
                We were dating
                for seven years.

10:55.004 --> 10:57.255
         Every time I brought
         up marriage you bocked.

10:57.256 --> 10:59.957
         You weren't interested

Well I'm allowed
to change my mind.

11:02.461 --> 11:04.179
                 You're good at
                 that obviously.

11:04.180 --> 11:08.299
Owen, we didn't end because
you weren't a nice guy.

11:11.187 --> 11:15.690
Okay we're just, not
right for each other.

11:15.691 --> 11:18.493
 I was never
truly happy.

11:18.494 --> 11:20.779
                 You could have
                 fooled me.

11:20.780 --> 11:24.532
Maybe because you always
saw me as a teenaged girl.

11:24.533 --> 11:27.619
I could never really
grow in that relationship.

11:28.621 --> 11:32.040
Owen, I care
about you, okay?

11:32.041 --> 11:34.042
This doesn't mean that
we can't be friends.

Yeah, we'll maybe I'll
get a good song out of it.

12:12.381 --> 12:16.033
         You know, maybe you
         should get out of here.

12:16.034 --> 12:18.002

12:21.206 --> 12:22.674
During the holidays?

12:22.675 --> 12:24.893
         Why not? There's no
         time like the present.

12:24.894 --> 12:27.762
    This living in the past is
    what got you into this mess.

12:27.763 --> 12:30.014

                    dreams Owen.

12:30.015 --> 12:33.151
         I think it's time you
         start chasing them.

12:33.152 --> 12:35.487
What if I fail?

12:35.488 --> 12:38.406
             Well you never know
             unless you try.

12:40.109 --> 12:42.360
             You familiar with
             the concept?

12:42.361 --> 12:45.246
Yeah, I think I
heard it somewhere.

12:45.247 --> 12:49.334
     Well maybe this holiday
     season we both adapt to it.

12:49.335 --> 12:51.035
That's fair.

12:51.036 --> 12:56.591
One day you'll find a love,
that you never knew you wanted,

12:56.592 --> 12:57.842
             but you desperately
             needed.

12:57.843 --> 12:59.377
                 And that's the
                 best kind.

12:59.378 --> 13:01.245
You know you
deserve the same.

13:04.934 --> 13:06.417
                     Some day.

13:15.144 --> 13:16.444
Christmas cards!

13:16.445 --> 13:19.781
I've already signed,
just need your signature.

13:19.782 --> 13:21.032
Sean?

13:21.033 --> 13:22.200
Are you okay?

13:24.069 --> 13:26.604
I know it burns, but
you just have to trust

13:26.605 --> 13:28.706
that everything
will be okay.

13:28.707 --> 13:31.826
                         Thanks.

13:31.827 --> 13:34.445
     She said I wasn't present
     in our relationship.

13:34.446 --> 13:36.631
         I'm too busy planning
         for the future.

13:38.450 --> 13:39.951
             You agree with her?

13:39.952 --> 13:42.136
Well, you are always
thinking ahead,

13:42.137 --> 13:44.506
I mean, which can
be a good thing.

13:44.507 --> 13:47.458
     So I plan too much and I
     have no real connection.

13:47.459 --> 13:51.346
Huh, well, this breakup has
officially ruined my Christmas.

13:51.347 --> 13:53.681
Get out of the city,
go to the country.

13:53.682 --> 13:55.433
Experience nature.

13:55.434 --> 13:57.819
You know, just quiet down
your life and relax.

13:57.820 --> 14:00.188
Really connect
with yourself.

14:00.189 --> 14:01.656
                Everything's
                probably booked.

14:03.108 --> 14:05.443
You ever think of
a house share?

14:05.444 --> 14:06.528
                 What's that?

14:06.529 --> 14:08.162
You basically just trade
places with someone.

14:08.163 --> 14:10.448
It's the latest craze,
tons of blogs about it.

14:10.449 --> 14:12.166
                 You saw this on
                 the internet?

14:12.167 --> 14:14.318
             I'm sure there's no
             psycho's involved.

14:14.319 --> 14:15.787
Don't be so judgmental.

14:15.788 --> 14:17.672
It's safe and background
checks are required.

14:17.673 --> 14:19.290
Believe me, it's legit.

14:19.291 --> 14:21.376
     You've checked this out?

14:22.595 --> 14:23.878
         You'd do it?

14:23.879 --> 14:27.966
If I had an amazing Manhattan
loft like you, absolutely.

14:27.967 --> 14:30.268
You can negotiate
a sweet swap.

14:31.887 --> 14:34.472
                 Maybe I should.

14:34.473 --> 14:36.507
             I never get out of
             the city anymore.

14:36.508 --> 14:37.775
Go.

14:37.776 --> 14:39.894
         You know what? I need
         to be more spontaneous.

14:41.513 --> 14:44.015
We worked together for two
years and you have never

14:44.016 --> 14:46.284
taken a vacation that
wasn't work related.

14:46.285 --> 14:48.620
I'd say treat yourself
and go for it.

29:29.083 --> 29:31.668
                 No, not at all.

29:31.669 --> 29:35.956
You're a terrible liar.

29:35.957 --> 29:40.043
         Okay, I just found
         out my ex got engaged.

29:40.044 --> 29:42.963
     We broke up 8 months ago
        after 7 years together.

29:42.964 --> 29:44.748
             I was hoping to
             get back together,

29:44.749 --> 29:46.750
         but I should've known
         that would not happen.

29:46.751 --> 29:48.268
                 Girls never
                 want nice guys.

29:48.269 --> 29:50.854
Okay. Who took you
aside as a little boy

29:50.855 --> 29:52.923
and filled your head
with that garbage.

29:52.924 --> 29:55.192
         Nobody, but it's true.

29:55.193 --> 29:57.144
         I did everything for
         her and what happens,

29:57.145 --> 29:58.261
                 I get dumped.

29:58.262 --> 30:01.064
Oh okay, so just because
you help someone out,

30:01.065 --> 30:03.600
or compliment them, or are
 nice to them then they're

30:03.601 --> 30:06.987
obligated to give you what
you want or be who you want?

30:06.988 --> 30:09.105
What's nice
about that?

30:09.106 --> 30:11.658
         Well nothing when you
         put it like that.

30:11.659 --> 30:15.111
 I guess we had different
 ideas about the relationship.

30:15.112 --> 30:17.581
Well when you project your
fantasy onto someone

30:17.582 --> 30:19.633
 you only set yourself
up for disappointment.

30:19.634 --> 30:21.552
And you prove that
you're selfish.

30:21.553 --> 30:22.669
Again, it's not so nice.

30:22.670 --> 30:24.505
                         Wow.

30:24.506 --> 30:28.392
     You New Yorkers are not
     afraid to speak your mind.

30:28.393 --> 30:31.428
I'm sorry to be blunt, I
always hear the song and dance

30:31.429 --> 30:33.680
and I think it's unfair to
women, that's all.

30:33.681 --> 30:35.966
             Well, you're right.

30:35.967 --> 30:39.436
        I never realized I lived
        in a fantasy world.

30:39.437 --> 30:42.973
            But I am a nice guy,
            that is real.

30:42.974 --> 30:44.658
There is a sweetness
about you.

30:44.659 --> 30:47.578
 My sister says a good breakup
 will allow me to sing from

30:47.579 --> 30:50.614
    real pain and help my career
    as a singer. So who knows,

30:50.615 --> 30:53.650
    maybe fate had a hand in
    leading me here to New York.

30:53.651 --> 30:57.204
You sing? You know I can
see that you have a nice

30:57.205 --> 30:58.622
little twang
in your voice.

30:58.623 --> 30:59.840
                 Why thank you.

30:59.841 --> 31:01.675

31:01.676 --> 31:04.327
You know what, I know
this great open mic bar.

31:04.328 --> 31:06.096
 We should head down
there tomorrow night

31:06.097 --> 31:07.848
and you can show
 off your chops.

31:07.849 --> 31:10.968
Oh wait a minute, tomorrow
night is all Christmas songs.

31:10.969 --> 31:12.102
             I love Christmas.

31:12.103 --> 31:13.687
         I love Christmas songs.

31:13.688 --> 31:14.721
             You gonna sing too?

31:14.722 --> 31:15.722
Oh... (laughs)

31:15.723 --> 31:18.275
No, I-- I sing with
a lot of passion,

31:18.276 --> 31:19.843
just not a lot
of talent,

31:19.844 --> 31:22.613
so it's probably better
I just cheer you on.

31:22.614 --> 31:25.649
So um, how's your
singing career going?

31:25.650 --> 31:28.184
     I made a demo and perform
     every now and then.

31:28.185 --> 31:31.187
    I'll have you know that I am
    very famous in my hometown

31:31.188 --> 31:32.906
     and loyal to my fan base.

31:37.078 --> 31:40.797
I can't wait to hear you
sing and you never know,

31:40.798 --> 31:44.217
this is a city when dreams come
true and careers are made.

31:44.218 --> 31:45.886

31:48.172 --> 31:50.424

31:56.931 --> 31:59.816
Well, you're welcome and don't
worry because my insight

31:59.817 --> 32:02.486

any obligation on your part.

32:02.487 --> 32:03.320

32:04.272 --> 32:05.439
                     Oh yeah.

            staying at Owen's?

33:30.575 --> 33:32.976
It's big news when
Owen swaps his house

for the holidays.

         Well not much longer,
         I'm leaving tonight.

33:38.032 --> 33:41.001
I told you you'll have heat
by the time we get back.

33:41.002 --> 33:45.155
It's not that, it's just I had
this fantasy about getting away

33:45.156 --> 33:50.627
 from the city and I think I'm
 a little out of my element.

33:50.628 --> 33:51.762
                     Or mind.

33:51.763 --> 33:53.213
Owen said
you're a cop.

33:53.214 --> 33:54.848
                 I may have lied
                 about that.

33:54.849 --> 33:58.468
You mean not all cops dress in
 designer clothes in New York.

33:58.469 --> 34:00.103
             I own an
             advertising agency.

34:00.104 --> 34:01.438
That's more believable.

34:01.439 --> 34:04.007
     So what can I get
    you all for breakfast.

34:04.008 --> 34:07.778
Oh um, I'll have the
eggs and the sausage.

34:10.014 --> 34:13.949
        Uh, do you have anything
        besides sausage?

34:13.951 --> 34:16.686
         Bacon or ham?

34:16.687 --> 34:19.688
Just bring him some
grits and toast.

34:19.690 --> 34:21.491
        Yup.

34:26.914 --> 34:29.416
     Grits? What if I hate it?

34:29.417 --> 34:31.083
Well then we'll
get you pancakes,

34:31.085 --> 34:33.369
but you won't because
you'll trust that whatever

34:33.370 --> 34:35.972
comes out of that kitchen
is gonna be amazing.

34:35.973 --> 34:38.308
         What do you do that
         makes you so positive?

34:38.309 --> 34:40.427
Um, I'm a veterinarian.

34:40.428 --> 34:41.428
                         A vet?

34:41.429 --> 34:43.764
                 Cats and dogs,
                 hamsters?

34:43.764 --> 34:46.099
I delivered a
colt last night.

34:46.100 --> 34:49.052
It was a difficult birth.

34:49.053 --> 34:51.054
Bringing new life into
the world does actually

34:51.054 --> 34:53.523
give me a positive
 attitude I guess.

34:53.524 --> 34:54.775
                     I get that.

34:54.775 --> 34:56.243
                So you've always
                loved animals?

34:56.244 --> 34:57.727
I have.

34:57.728 --> 35:01.414
But it wasn't until my marriage
fell apart that I became a vet.

35:01.415 --> 35:03.900
    Well that's pretty brave,
    starting a whole new career.

35:03.901 --> 35:06.169
When everything
crashed and burned,

35:06.170 --> 35:08.088
I went for a walk.

35:08.089 --> 35:11.407
I saw this horse just
basking in the sun,

35:11.408 --> 35:14.344
not caring about the
 past or the future,

35:14.345 --> 35:18.248
just fully present in
enjoying the moment.

35:18.249 --> 35:20.050
And I thought,
that's what I want.

35:20.051 --> 35:23.603
That's where I wanna be.
I wanna be in the present.

35:23.604 --> 35:26.807
It's not always good,
but I'm willing to go

35:26.808 --> 35:29.726
wherever it takes me.

35:29.727 --> 35:31.611
I find life's more
exciting that way.

35:31.612 --> 35:33.363
     So you got from a horse,

35:33.364 --> 35:35.899
 what most people pay thousands
 of dollars for in therapy.

35:35.900 --> 35:36.950
(laughs)

35:36.951 --> 35:41.071
I'm better at giving
advice then taking it.

35:41.072 --> 35:43.740
 But you can learn
a lot from nature.

35:43.741 --> 35:45.659
I applied to vet
school the next day.

advertising?

40:52.183 --> 40:56.102
     My dad was in it; I just
     stayed with what I knew.

resistance.

40:57.721 --> 41:00.356
            Something like that,

I bet you're good at it;
you look like a good salesman.

41:03.360 --> 41:05.945
        My last campaign was a
        flying robotic reindeer.

41:05.946 --> 41:07.063
Robo-reindeer?

41:07.064 --> 41:09.482
Oh, my brother loved
that when he was a kid.

41:09.483 --> 41:11.484
         Well I'm the guy that
         revived his career

You're the guy that did that?
You are a good salesman.

41:15.272 --> 41:18.041
        Well I don't think of it
        as selling as much as

41:18.042 --> 41:20.910
         creating an illusion.

41:20.911 --> 41:23.663
In some ways I think that
concept has managed

41:23.664 --> 41:26.449
to bleed into my
personal life.

41:26.450 --> 41:27.967
                         How so?

41:27.968 --> 41:32.255
Well, sometimes I think I
have managed to fool myself

41:32.256 --> 41:34.724
 into thinking I'm
happier than I am.

41:34.725 --> 41:36.125
             You're not happy?

41:36.126 --> 41:39.729

experienced moments like this

41:39.730 --> 41:43.850
morning, and
right now,

41:43.851 --> 41:47.403
and I think that's what
real happiness is.

41:49.657 --> 41:52.808
 You know, for some people, the
 best decision they ever made

41:52.809 --> 41:56.779
    is letting go of a plan and
 allowing fate to carry them.

41:56.780 --> 41:58.314
Is that so?

41:58.315 --> 41:59.582
Is that what you do?

41:59.583 --> 42:00.783
                     (laughs)

42:00.784 --> 42:02.252
                     I try to.

42:02.253 --> 42:06.206
     But sometimes it's easier
     to say no rather then yes.

42:06.207 --> 42:08.541
         Maybe it's out of fear.

42:08.542 --> 42:11.211
         I told you I'm bad at
         taking my own advice.

42:11.212 --> 42:12.679
It's hard to believe.

42:14.831 --> 42:16.799
            Well you're not the
         only one that's good

42:16.800 --> 42:18.635

             making me blush.

love that too.

     Do you have a big family
     celebration for Christmas?

42:53.254 --> 42:56.055
Not really my parents moved to
Florida and I can't usually

42:56.056 --> 42:58.308
take any time off.

42:58.309 --> 43:00.176
        Well you got a
     boyfriend at least.

43:00.177 --> 43:02.645
Yeah but he'll probably work
straight through the holiday's,

43:02.646 --> 43:05.181
he's a realtor and
 he's always busy.

43:07.651 --> 43:09.902
Um, thank you.

I have to go to one

43:12.489 --> 43:16.058
of his open houses
just to see him.

43:16.059 --> 43:19.529
Call me old fashioned but
I feel like if someone really

43:19.530 --> 43:23.666
wants to see you,
they'll make an effort.

43:27.070 --> 43:29.539

judging, it's not my--

43:29.540 --> 43:32.241
     No, you're right, I mean,
     you're not the first person

43:32.242 --> 43:34.427

43:34.428 --> 43:36.796
             We have problems;
             I guess I'm just,

43:36.797 --> 43:39.015
             uh, stupid for
             letting it happen.

43:39.016 --> 43:42.918
No, no, you just
want to be loved.

43:42.919 --> 43:45.355
We all do.

43:45.356 --> 43:49.392
         It sounds so pathetic,
         but it's true.

43:49.393 --> 43:51.394
Some things take
more effort.

43:51.395 --> 43:53.129
It's worth it
in the end.

43:53.130 --> 43:54.447
                    Can you tell

It never happened.

01:16:32.187 --> 01:16:33.854

            Not anymore.
            I broke up with him.

01:16:48.987 --> 01:16:50.955
You did?

01:16:50.956 --> 01:16:53.090

01:16:53.091 --> 01:16:56.927
     I realized that everything
     that was wrong with him,

01:16:56.928 --> 01:16:59.597
             was right with you.

         you sang silent night.

My sister told me that if I
stay open I may find a love

01:17:11.676 --> 01:17:16.030
I never knew I wanted but,
desperately needed.

01:17:16.031 --> 01:17:19.317
 I thought it was a bunch of
nonsense but when I met you,

01:17:19.318 --> 01:17:23.621
I realized how
true it really is.

01:17:26.408 --> 01:17:30.411
I had to come all the way to
New York City to find it but

01:17:30.412 --> 01:17:34.332
somewhere along the way
I fell for you Mia.

01:17:34.333 --> 01:17:37.835
 I don't know maybe I fell for
you the first moment I saw you

01:17:37.836 --> 01:17:43.257
but was just too stupid or
too scared to admit it.

01:17:43.258 --> 01:17:48.012
But now with every moment I
fall deeper and deeper in love.

01:17:48.013 --> 01:17:50.398

 You have no idea how wonderful
 it is to hear you say that.

I'm in love with you too but I
just thought I was being silly.

01:18:01.276 --> 01:18:03.361
Would you by chance
want to spend Christmas

01:18:03.362 --> 01:18:05.562
back home with me?

01:18:08.250 --> 01:18:09.533
I guess that's a yes.

You don't have to explain,

It's fine.

 should try some time.

01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:11.929

         told you about Kimber,

01:19:11.930 --> 01:19:13.097
                     I'm sorry.

01:19:13.098 --> 01:19:14.849
I asked you why
you came here.

01:19:14.850 --> 01:19:16.684
You never said anything
about a girlfriend,

01:19:16.685 --> 01:19:19.320
and definitely
 not a fiancé.

01:19:19.321 --> 01:19:22.907
            That's because at
            the time she wasn't.

01:19:22.908 --> 01:19:25.993
     Yes I bought a ring and
     yes I was going to propose.

01:19:25.994 --> 01:19:27.578
                         I...

01:19:27.579 --> 01:19:30.698
     had all these ideas about
     how the future would be

01:19:30.699 --> 01:19:36.420
        and you know what, life
     just laughed in my face.

01:19:36.421 --> 01:19:38.122
I'm sure it did,

01:19:38.123 --> 01:19:40.841
but Kimber made it very clear
that you're still together.

01:19:40.842 --> 01:19:42.326
Why else would
she come here?

01:19:42.327 --> 01:19:43.878
                Kimber came here
                on her own.

01:19:43.879 --> 01:19:46.547
         No invitation from me.

01:19:47.015 --> 01:19:48.933
            Ugh...

01:19:48.934 --> 01:19:51.218
I don't know, maybe this
just all happened so

01:19:51.219 --> 01:19:52.770
 we don't make
a big mistake.

01:19:52.771 --> 01:19:55.723
         Or maybe Kimber did
         me the biggest favor.

01:19:55.724 --> 01:19:58.842
 If she hadn't made me realize
 how I was living my life

01:19:58.843 --> 01:20:00.895
                 I would never
                 of come here.

01:20:03.365 --> 01:20:05.682
         And I never would of
         realized I was missing

01:20:05.683 --> 01:20:09.236
             a real connection
             in my life.

01:20:09.237 --> 01:20:12.706
                 I never would
                 of found you.

01:20:12.707 --> 01:20:14.959
         You woke me up Ryan.

01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:18.162
You made me realize that if I'm
always planning for the future

01:20:18.163 --> 01:20:21.882
         I won't be present for
         it when it comes.

01:20:21.883 --> 01:20:26.203
You showed me how to be present,
how to absorb the moment.

01:20:26.204 --> 01:20:30.758
     And you made me be
     willing to experience it.

01:20:30.759 --> 01:20:35.095
It's not just my
heart that's at risk.

01:20:35.096 --> 01:20:37.181
Maybe this is all an
illusion you're gonna

01:20:37.182 --> 01:20:39.183
forget when you go
 back to New York.

01:20:39.184 --> 01:20:41.151
                 No, it's not.

01:20:41.152 --> 01:20:44.355
     What's real to me is that
     every moment I'm with you,

01:20:44.356 --> 01:20:47.224
             is the best moment
             of my life.

01:20:47.225 --> 01:20:49.193

             here you say this.

You'll get on
the plane--

01:20:58.253 --> 01:21:04.041

        way I am turning back.

                 is wonderful.

01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:12.266
        You didn't really think
     that would scare me off?

01:21:12.267 --> 01:21:13.601
Maybe.

01:21:13.602 --> 01:21:15.853
             Is that why you
             kept it a secret?

01:21:15.854 --> 01:21:19.607
I'm not looking
for a dad for Kalup.

01:21:19.608 --> 01:21:24.612
What scares me, Sean, is
that he seems to like you.

01:21:24.613 --> 01:21:27.314
That boy has dealt with
a lot of disappointment

01:21:27.315 --> 01:21:31.101
and I don't want to feel one
 ounce of what I felt today.

01:21:31.102 --> 01:21:32.953

you won't do it again.

         I promise you I won't.

01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:51.639

                 You know why?

01:21:55.343 --> 01:21:58.896
    Because I was just supposed
 to be coming her to regroup.

01:21:58.897 --> 01:22:01.815
     That's what's so astounding
     about all of this.
