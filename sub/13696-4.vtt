00:05.049 --> 00:06.634
How many more
are you going to take?

00:06.718 --> 00:08.970
I'm freezing
my backside off here.

00:09.053 --> 00:10.471
I could warm
it up for you, Ewan.

00:10.555 --> 00:12.682
Sounds promising. Ahh!

00:14.225 --> 00:17.061
That wasn't quite
what I had in mind.

00:17.145 --> 00:19.397
Just one more
roll of film, right?

00:19.480 --> 00:20.732
Oh, I get it.

00:20.815 --> 00:23.067
You've suffered for your art,
now it's my turn.

00:26.404 --> 00:28.531
I mean, you've seen one
shot of the loch at sunset,

00:28.614 --> 00:29.615
you've seen them all, right?

00:30.824 --> 00:32.493
(SEAGULLS SQUEALING)

00:40.752 --> 00:42.295
You should have
put some lotion on.

00:42.378 --> 00:45.381
-You've really caught the sun.
-Uh-huh.

00:45.465 --> 00:47.508
Funky kind of light though.
(CHUCKLES)

00:47.592 --> 00:50.720
You know, I kind of like it,
being locked
in a dark room with you.

00:50.803 --> 00:54.891
Ewan, stop it.
This is important
for my school project.

00:54.974 --> 00:56.809
Aw!

00:56.893 --> 00:59.479
-What?
-There's a splodge.

00:59.562 --> 01:01.022
Best one, too.

01:15.787 --> 01:17.038
AMY: Oi!

01:18.706 --> 01:20.208
You could have ruined my film.

01:20.291 --> 01:22.043
Amy, we're gonna be rich.

01:22.126 --> 01:23.878
What are you talking about?
Look at that.

01:23.961 --> 01:25.963
Why? It's just a splodge.

01:26.047 --> 01:28.799
Since when does a splodge
have a long snaky neck?

02:11.509 --> 02:13.302
I'm not interested, Ewan.

02:13.386 --> 02:14.929
I don't understand.
How can you not be?

02:15.013 --> 02:17.598
Monsters are in books,
not Scottish lochs.

02:17.682 --> 02:19.100
But you saw the photo.

02:19.183 --> 02:21.227
A trick of the light.
A log in the water.

02:21.310 --> 02:23.646
A monster-shaped
swarm of midges.

02:23.730 --> 02:26.024
Oh, there's
a card from Donald.

02:26.107 --> 02:27.650
What's the old fella up to?

02:27.734 --> 02:30.737
He says his pal,
the luxury hotel owner,

02:30.820 --> 02:34.157
turns out to be running
a naturist centre
in the French Alps.

02:34.240 --> 02:36.242
Ooh, la la!

02:36.325 --> 02:38.411
I'm just trying to get you
to open your mind
to the possibilities, Paul.

02:38.494 --> 02:41.539
Well, don't bother.
My mind is only open
for business.

02:41.622 --> 02:43.708
He says, everything
is going swimmingly,

02:43.791 --> 02:44.876
even in the pool,

02:44.958 --> 02:47.128
until there was
a sudden cold snap.

02:47.211 --> 02:48.338
Ooh, sounds painful.

02:48.421 --> 02:49.756
But that's what
I'm trying to say.

02:49.839 --> 02:52.592
MOLLY: And someone
got frostbite. (CHUCKLES)

02:52.675 --> 02:54.969
-PAUL: Damn.
-Lovely scrambled eggs, Ewan.

02:55.053 --> 02:56.679
Thanks, Molly.

02:56.763 --> 02:58.931
I made that recipe
with pecorino cheese
and double cream.

03:00.183 --> 03:01.517
Look at this lot.

03:01.601 --> 03:03.144
Anyone would think
we're living at the Savoy.

03:04.103 --> 03:05.688
Portrait of angry man.

03:07.690 --> 03:09.525
What am I doing here,
I'm not even hungry.

03:12.320 --> 03:13.529
Hamish is coming, you see.

03:14.906 --> 03:16.240
Paul, I have to tell
you something.

03:16.324 --> 03:18.409
No, enough is enough.

03:18.493 --> 03:21.662
-Okay, I'll move out tomorrow.
-What?

03:21.746 --> 03:24.040
Oh, no, no, no,
I'm sorry. I was just, um...

03:26.584 --> 03:29.087
Never mind.
Did you sleep well?

03:29.170 --> 03:30.463
Yeah, great thanks.

03:30.546 --> 03:31.923
Yeah, you look
like you slept well.

03:33.716 --> 03:35.051
I mean, um...

03:35.802 --> 03:37.428
Very awake looking.

03:37.512 --> 03:39.347
Why?
Do I normally look sleepy?

03:39.430 --> 03:41.891
No, no, no, no, not at all.

03:46.145 --> 03:47.355
I'll catch you later.

03:51.691 --> 03:54.320
Hamish is coming. Paul.

03:54.404 --> 03:56.406
-Paul.
-What?

03:56.489 --> 03:58.199
I think you ought to know...

03:58.282 --> 04:00.076
There's a boat
coming up the drive.

04:00.159 --> 04:02.286
-A boat?
-Oh, that's very clever.

04:02.370 --> 04:04.204
They usually arrive on water.

04:07.500 --> 04:09.544
What in heaven's
name is going on now?

04:12.463 --> 04:13.965
Hamish is coming.

04:24.015 --> 04:25.184
Hello, there.

04:25.267 --> 04:27.395
Hi, we come in peace.

04:27.477 --> 04:29.147
Sorry, sorry,
how can I help you?

04:29.814 --> 04:31.107
Paul, Paul...

04:33.359 --> 04:35.486
This is what I've been
trying to tell you.

04:37.030 --> 04:38.573
Hi.

04:38.656 --> 04:41.492
You see the lozenge
shaped head,
the elongated neck.

04:41.576 --> 04:44.120
Typical of cryptoclidids
and elasmosaurs.

04:44.203 --> 04:47.038
Plesiosaurids too, obviously,
but my gut feeling

04:47.123 --> 04:48.708
-is veering away
from the Upper Triassic...
-Simon.

04:50.376 --> 04:51.627
Why, I am sorry.

04:52.670 --> 04:55.548
Um, what I'm saying is,

04:55.631 --> 04:58.259
that this sighting
is entirely consistent

04:58.343 --> 05:00.345
with the Plesiosaur
hypothesis.

05:00.428 --> 05:02.305
What's that,
some sort of dinosaur?

05:02.388 --> 05:03.431
Oh, no absolutely not.

05:03.514 --> 05:04.557
No, no, no,

05:04.640 --> 05:05.683
marine euryapsids may be

05:05.767 --> 05:07.018
-Mesozoic, but anyone...
-BILL: Er, Simon.

05:08.478 --> 05:09.729
Sorry.

05:09.812 --> 05:13.316
Um, yes, more or less,
Miss MacDougal.

05:16.152 --> 05:19.238
But, this is what I really
wanted to show you.

05:22.533 --> 05:24.535
Thank you, Bill.

05:24.619 --> 05:29.374
This is what brought us here
in such hope and excitement.

05:29.457 --> 05:31.793
-Amy's photograph.
-Ta-da!

05:31.876 --> 05:36.964
This could be the most famous
photograph in the world.

05:37.882 --> 05:39.342
Here's why.

05:41.219 --> 05:42.387
(BEEPING)

05:44.639 --> 05:46.599
You could have
got it in focus, Amy.

05:46.683 --> 05:47.684
Watch.

05:48.810 --> 05:50.561
There!

05:50.644 --> 05:51.729
Isn't that something?

05:51.813 --> 05:53.106
Goodness me.

05:53.189 --> 05:55.900
Ladies and gentlemen,
you could be sitting

05:55.983 --> 05:58.985
on the most important
discovery in the natural
history of these islands.

05:59.070 --> 06:01.155
Sorry, hold on a minute.

06:01.239 --> 06:02.699
How's it possible?

06:02.782 --> 06:04.909
How could it have survived for
all these millions of years?

06:04.992 --> 06:06.494
You know, species
long thought extinct

06:06.577 --> 06:07.787
turn up from time to time.

06:07.870 --> 06:09.330
Er, the coelacanth,
for example.

06:09.413 --> 06:12.667
A fish in the Indian ocean.
Strange looking kind of thing.

06:12.750 --> 06:14.168
The loch is big
and deep enough

06:14.252 --> 06:17.005
to support
a viable population.

06:17.088 --> 06:18.798
So how come no one's
seen any of them, then?

06:18.881 --> 06:20.258
They have.

06:20.341 --> 06:21.634
Your father swore
they were there.

06:21.718 --> 06:22.969
"Each-uisge" he called them,

06:23.052 --> 06:24.512
the Water Horse.

06:24.595 --> 06:26.305
There's pictures of them
in the old history books.

06:26.389 --> 06:28.141
How fascinating.

06:28.224 --> 06:30.768
So, Dr Cotter, you and erm...

06:30.852 --> 06:34.439
Bill. Short for William.

06:34.522 --> 06:36.441
You want to spend a few
days surveying the loch?

06:36.524 --> 06:37.734
With your permission.

06:38.735 --> 06:39.736
Jess?

06:40.695 --> 06:41.779
A motorboat on the loch?

06:41.863 --> 06:44.699
No, no, it would
disturb the wildlife.

06:44.782 --> 06:47.785
And I'm not talking about
the monster.

06:47.869 --> 06:50.038
-PAUL: Golly?
-It's a fairy tale.

06:50.121 --> 06:51.205
I'm sorry, Dr Cotter,

06:51.289 --> 06:53.041
you've heard what
my ghillies have said.

06:53.124 --> 06:55.710
This is a distraction
from the real business
of running Glenbogle,

06:55.793 --> 06:56.836
but please stay
and have some lunch.

06:56.919 --> 06:58.296
Amy, you're late for school.

06:58.379 --> 07:00.006
Excuse me,
I have another appointment.

07:01.632 --> 07:02.759
(DOOR CLOSES)

07:02.842 --> 07:04.052
ALL: Hamish.

07:08.264 --> 07:10.350
Mr MacDonald.

07:10.433 --> 07:12.769
-Hamish.
-Congratulations.

07:12.852 --> 07:15.229
-Yeah?
-These are, without doubt,

07:15.313 --> 07:17.690
the most catastrophic set

07:17.774 --> 07:21.277
of accounts
I've seen in 50 years.

07:22.070 --> 07:23.237

Oh, the page for thickos,

07:33.039 --> 07:37.377
otherwise known
as the executive summary,
is on page five.

07:43.675 --> 07:45.593
My God.

07:45.677 --> 07:50.139
Aye, I'm afraid
he's the only one who
might be able to help you.

07:50.223 --> 07:53.935
Turning your bank manager
into a pillar of salt

07:54.018 --> 07:56.688
might be a useful diversion.

07:56.771 --> 07:58.648
I thought you were
supposed to be on my side.

07:58.731 --> 08:03.236
Accountants are never
on any side but their own,
Mr MacDonald.

08:03.319 --> 08:06.447
But if the bank sees
these figures they'll never
extend the loan. (SCOFFS)

08:06.531 --> 08:08.241
I mean, you made it look
as if we're going bankrupt.

08:12.870 --> 08:13.996
We just need a little time.

08:14.080 --> 08:15.498
Things are bound to improve.

08:15.580 --> 08:17.667
Well, I cannot
falsify the accounts.

08:17.750 --> 08:19.460
I'm not asking you to,

08:19.544 --> 08:23.256
but couldn't you
be a little more creative?

08:23.339 --> 08:24.966
Creative?

08:25.049 --> 08:28.052
Oh, I'm a number cruncher
not a writer of fiction.

08:29.721 --> 08:33.558
Or maybe, I'm just
a little old-fashioned.

08:33.640 --> 08:37.687
Maybe you'd be better off
with one of the new breed.

08:37.770 --> 08:41.524
They don't worry too much
about irritating details,

08:41.607 --> 08:44.277
like facts and figures.

08:44.360 --> 08:45.695
Maybe you're right.

08:46.529 --> 08:50.533
Good day, Mr MacDonald.

08:50.616 --> 08:56.913
I'd present you with my bill
if I had any confidence
you'd be able to pay it.

(BRIEFCASE CLICKS SHUT)

09:06.758 --> 09:08.051

09:08.134 --> 09:10.595
Not making them
a proper lunch then, Ewan?

09:10.678 --> 09:13.473
They want to spend
what little time they
have here by the loch.

09:13.556 --> 09:15.725
Look, I'm sorry
if you're disappointed...

09:15.808 --> 09:18.394
You're the one always
going on about the estate
and pulling our weight.

09:18.478 --> 09:20.938
But when someone comes up
with a good idea,
you just squash it flat.

09:21.022 --> 09:23.566
-I don't believe it.
-Think of the tourists.

09:23.649 --> 09:24.859
Word gets out there's
a monster in the loch,

09:24.942 --> 09:26.152
we'll be bussing them in.

09:26.235 --> 09:28.529
But there isn't a monster
in the loch.

09:28.613 --> 09:30.114
You just don't get it, do you?

09:30.198 --> 09:31.407
That doesn't matter.

09:31.491 --> 09:32.742
I'm talking
business here, Paul.

09:35.995 --> 09:37.372
You talk to him, Iona.

09:47.173 --> 09:48.466
Well?

09:48.549 --> 09:51.511
Well, Ewan's got
something to offer.

09:53.221 --> 09:54.430

-I'll take these out.
-No, no.

10:02.939 --> 10:04.315
I'll do it.

10:17.286 --> 10:19.247
Have you ever had
an obsession, Mr MacDonald?

10:19.330 --> 10:20.623

your every living moment.

be getting worse.

from my scientific colleagues,

Maybe even
pleasurable for some.

-I doubt that very much.
-For the salmon, anyway.

11:36.532 --> 11:39.702

than Scots girls and that's
really saying something.

was on the breeding

published on Platycephalus

I guess I sort of am.

12:35.091 --> 12:36.092
Bill!

12:36.759 --> 12:38.761
Bill! We're on!

12:38.845 --> 12:40.555
We're on! (LAUGHS)

12:59.449 --> 13:01.159
Bit pleased
with himself, isn't he?

13:01.868 --> 13:03.661
The Bill fellow.

13:03.745 --> 13:06.789
In my opinion,
he needs cutting down to size.

13:15.006 --> 13:18.259
And what exactly
are you up to?
As if I didn't know.

13:18.343 --> 13:21.054
Giving a natural
process a little nudge.

13:21.137 --> 13:22.221
It'll be good for Jess.

13:22.305 --> 13:24.182
Molly, just leave well alone.

13:24.265 --> 13:26.726
Too late.
I've lit the touch paper.

13:26.809 --> 13:30.980
All we need to do now
is retire to a safe distance
and watch.

13:37.403 --> 13:38.446
Morning.

13:47.413 --> 13:49.707
Iona's a homebody all right.

13:49.791 --> 13:51.542
I'll be right
glad to get back.

13:57.256 --> 13:58.257
(SIGHING)

14:04.681 --> 14:08.184
Even though I say it myself
the boys have done a good job.

14:08.267 --> 14:09.811
I'm sure she'll be pleased.

14:13.314 --> 14:15.274
Gave it a thorough
clean when we finished.

14:15.358 --> 14:16.901
Folk appreciate that.

14:21.906 --> 14:24.242
-Is there a problem?
-Yeah, a number.

14:24.325 --> 14:26.577
-Like what?
-The floor needs another
layer of varnish,

14:26.661 --> 14:28.413
the skirting board
needs beading,

14:28.496 --> 14:30.665
that light switch
is on the wrong side
and the door handle is shaky.

14:30.748 --> 14:31.791
It's never shaky.

14:37.588 --> 14:39.048
Shaky.

14:39.132 --> 14:42.093
-Have you moved a window?
-Yeah, it used to be there.

14:42.176 --> 14:43.469
And why did you do that?

14:43.553 --> 14:45.471
Well, where it was
it let in very little light.

14:45.555 --> 14:47.432
Here it opens
onto a nice view.
So, I thought...

14:47.515 --> 14:48.766
Move it back.

14:48.850 --> 14:50.101
-You're kidding.
-No, I'm not.

14:50.184 --> 14:52.061
And I don't want to be
billed for it, either.

14:52.145 --> 14:55.481
I've given you more than
enough work recently
to justify a little goodwill.

14:59.652 --> 15:03.114
So, I told him,
"No tenant of mine
is getting a second rate job.

15:03.197 --> 15:05.408
"I want it done again
and I want it done properly."

15:06.701 --> 15:09.203
-That was kind of you.
-Yeah, well.

15:10.496 --> 15:13.249
So, um,
so where are you off to today?

15:13.332 --> 15:16.210
Oh, Amy left her bag,
so I'm just gonna drop it in.

15:16.294 --> 15:18.087
Oh, you don't have to do that.

15:18.171 --> 15:21.632
I know, but I've got
errands to run anyway.

15:21.716 --> 15:25.303
I want to get some groceries
and I don't want to be
a complete scrounger.

15:25.386 --> 15:27.347
You, um,
you don't mind, do you?

15:27.430 --> 15:30.600
You know, erm,
staying here a bit longer?

15:30.683 --> 15:32.810
Oh, no, I don't mind at all.

15:32.894 --> 15:34.437
If, if you don't mind.

15:34.520 --> 15:37.357
Me? No, not at all.

15:37.440 --> 15:39.525
You're about the only one
that keeps me
sane around here.

15:40.151 --> 15:41.986
Oh.

15:42.070 --> 15:44.781
Well, um, I'm glad
I'm earning my keep.

15:46.699 --> 15:48.201
-Right.
-Right.

15:50.495 --> 15:51.496
Yeah.

15:55.083 --> 15:56.918
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

16:00.421 --> 16:01.422
Iona Maclean!

16:02.090 --> 16:03.341
Mrs Obrie.

16:03.424 --> 16:05.259
And what did I say
about wearing jeans in school?

16:05.718 --> 16:06.761
Oh.

16:08.262 --> 16:10.223
(CHUCKLES) Good one.

16:10.306 --> 16:12.433
Dear me, was I really
that scary?

16:12.517 --> 16:14.102
Well, you had your moments.

16:14.185 --> 16:16.396
-It's lovely to see you.
-And you.

16:16.479 --> 16:18.231
You'll be here about Amy.

16:18.314 --> 16:19.649
Erm, yeah.

16:19.732 --> 16:21.526
How's the wee soul feeling?

16:21.609 --> 16:23.903
-Sorry?
-My sister's girl had ME.

16:23.986 --> 16:25.738
It's an awful illness.

16:25.822 --> 16:27.156
How long do you
think she'll be off?

16:30.159 --> 16:32.328
EWAN: The old Laird
of Glenbogle was
a true believer

16:32.412 --> 16:35.164
in the existence of the other
ancient resident of the Glen,

16:35.248 --> 16:37.166
and he liked nothing
better than to wander around

16:37.250 --> 16:40.545
the gardens after
a good dinner and look out
for his old friend.

16:40.628 --> 16:43.840
This is the perfect spot
for a monster viewing zone,
as you'll see.

16:53.016 --> 16:54.100
Ewan.

16:54.183 --> 16:55.518
Er, excuse me.

16:59.105 --> 17:00.440
Who are those people?

17:00.523 --> 17:02.358
Er, chief reporter
from the Glenbogle Bugle,

17:02.442 --> 17:04.444
bloke from the Tourist Board,
coach tour operator,

17:04.527 --> 17:06.069
the manager
of the Inverness Hilton

17:06.154 --> 17:07.864
and a novelty
goods manufacturer
from Drumnadrochit.

17:07.946 --> 17:10.074
-What are they doing here?
-I'm giving them the tour.

17:10.157 --> 17:12.577
They love it. I'm telling you,
Paul, by Friday this place

17:12.660 --> 17:14.203
will be thronged
with people with their wallets
hanging open.

17:14.287 --> 17:16.122
Ewan, I never agreed to this.

17:16.204 --> 17:17.457
I thought it was
what you wanted.

17:17.540 --> 17:19.834
Enterprise, initiative, cash.

17:21.169 --> 17:22.337
Er, excuse me.

17:22.420 --> 17:23.921
If you'll follow me into
the family dining room,

17:24.005 --> 17:26.507
I'll serve you the
Glenbogle Monster High Tea.

17:32.847 --> 17:34.349
-Alright?
-Yeah.

18:14.347 --> 18:16.557
-Hi.
-Hello there.

18:16.641 --> 18:18.810
Any idea where I might
be able to grab some milk?

18:18.893 --> 18:20.978
Yeah, if you turn
right round here,

18:21.062 --> 18:22.647
up the hill you'll come
to a cottage.

18:22.730 --> 18:24.482
Golly and Jess live there.

18:24.565 --> 18:25.608
Oh, right.

18:34.742 --> 18:36.744
-Good evening.
-Oh.

18:39.414 --> 18:41.666
Erm, sausage and beans?

18:41.749 --> 18:43.459
-Chilean Sauvignon?
-(CHUCKLES)

18:50.800 --> 18:52.385
Better not let Ewan see you.

18:52.468 --> 18:54.178
He'll charge you
a tenner for that.

18:54.262 --> 18:55.471
(CHUCKLES)

18:55.555 --> 18:56.889
You're home late.

18:56.973 --> 18:59.058
Yeah, I had a session
at school with my art teacher.

18:59.142 --> 19:00.893
I showed her my photos.

19:00.977 --> 19:02.937
Obviously not the one
of the monster.

19:03.021 --> 19:04.605
She really liked them.

19:04.689 --> 19:07.108
Said I had a real flair
for composition and...

19:07.191 --> 19:08.484
Telling porkies?

19:10.403 --> 19:11.946
What do you mean?

19:12.030 --> 19:14.532
Well, how could you show
her your photos if they
were in your bag

19:14.615 --> 19:16.951
and you left your bag
here, Amy?

19:19.454 --> 19:21.914
Erm... I had copies.

19:21.998 --> 19:23.041
Amy, don't.

19:23.124 --> 19:25.626
Look, you never
went to school.

19:25.710 --> 19:27.295
I know.

19:27.378 --> 19:30.340
So, are you
in some kind of trouble,

19:30.423 --> 19:31.758
or is somebody bullying you?

19:31.841 --> 19:33.217
I don't want to talk about it.

19:33.301 --> 19:34.594
Amy, maybe I could help you.

19:35.970 --> 19:37.638
I don't want to talk about it.

20:08.169 --> 20:10.171
Hi.

20:10.254 --> 20:13.966
I was wondering if you
had a spare pint of milk
for the lonesome traveller?

20:14.050 --> 20:16.177
Sure you don't need
a cup of sugar with it?

20:16.260 --> 20:18.346
Sweet enough as it is.

20:18.429 --> 20:19.472
Please.

20:19.555 --> 20:21.808
Just wait there.

20:31.609 --> 20:33.361
You could have
invited him in, lass.

20:34.862 --> 20:37.407
Keep him where he belongs.
On the outside.

20:40.660 --> 20:42.704
Molly, I don't understand.

20:42.787 --> 20:44.956
If you want them
to get together,

20:45.039 --> 20:47.000
why do you
keep running him down?

20:47.083 --> 20:49.836
Golly, you really
ought to get out more.

20:55.091 --> 20:57.385
Thank you,
fair maiden of the milk.

20:57.468 --> 20:58.886
Look, just cut it out,
will you?

20:58.970 --> 21:01.431
-I'm sorry?
-I can read you like a book.

21:01.514 --> 21:02.974
A cheap paperback.

21:03.057 --> 21:04.100
I don't understand.

21:04.183 --> 21:06.394
I know exactly
how you operate.

21:06.477 --> 21:09.313
Another loch, another monster,
another girl.

21:09.397 --> 21:10.815
No, that's not how I am.

21:10.898 --> 21:13.026
Well, I don't want to be
another notch
on your echosounder.

21:13.109 --> 21:15.069
You may have

21:15.153 --> 21:18.114
good muscle definition

21:18.197 --> 21:19.741
but you do nothing for me.

21:19.824 --> 21:24.328
Nothing, zero, zilch.
You don't even
register on my radar.

21:24.871 --> 21:25.913
Okay?

21:25.997 --> 21:27.874
I was going to ask you
out on a date.

21:27.957 --> 21:29.292
(SCOFFS)

21:29.375 --> 21:31.127
I'd rather have pins
stuck in my eyes.

21:34.547 --> 21:35.548
Wow.

21:40.136 --> 21:43.598
Honestly, he is the limit,
that one.

21:43.681 --> 21:46.976
Devastatingly attractive
but utterly insufferable.

21:56.986 --> 21:59.739
You obviously get funding
for your work.

22:00.490 --> 22:02.617
Yes.

22:02.700 --> 22:05.578
I'd be quite happy to pay
a facility fee if that's what
you're thinking.

22:05.661 --> 22:06.746
No, I'm not.

22:06.829 --> 22:08.331
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean...

22:08.414 --> 22:10.166
No, I know, Dr Cotter.

22:10.249 --> 22:11.751
Simon, please.

22:13.670 --> 22:16.464
If there is something
significant out there,

22:16.547 --> 22:19.634
then we'll be able
to tap into all manner
of new sources.

22:19.717 --> 22:21.844
Then we're talking real money.

22:21.928 --> 22:25.014
I'm sorry if I was a bit
rude earlier on.

22:25.098 --> 22:28.226
Oh, good heavens...

22:28.309 --> 22:30.895
-I quite understand.
-No, you don't.

22:32.814 --> 22:35.274
-No one does.
-Explain.

22:39.153 --> 22:40.405
It's just...

22:42.615 --> 22:46.953
When you're trying
to save paradise,

22:47.036 --> 22:49.872
preserve and protect it for
the people you love,

22:52.375 --> 22:54.210
everything goes wrong.

22:54.293 --> 22:55.837
You're carrying such
a responsibility,

22:55.920 --> 22:57.547
under so much pressure...

22:59.716 --> 23:04.512
It gradually
ceases to be a paradise.

23:04.595 --> 23:07.098
You fall out
of step with those people

23:08.307 --> 23:09.892
and the place itself...

23:12.812 --> 23:14.355
And you end up lost.

23:18.276 --> 23:19.610
That's how I feel, Simon.

23:22.155 --> 23:23.781
Gosh.

23:23.865 --> 23:26.826
Er, please don't mention
this to anyone.

23:26.909 --> 23:29.871
Oh, good heavens, no,
no, not a word. (STAMMERS)

23:29.954 --> 23:31.831
It's sometimes easier to, er,

23:31.914 --> 23:34.625
talk to complete strangers
about the important things.

23:39.130 --> 23:41.132
I better go.

23:41.215 --> 23:42.884
Yes, and I'd better
find that Plesiosaur.

23:42.967 --> 23:44.010
(BOTH LAUGH)

23:44.093 --> 23:47.055
Well, er,
I won't hold my breath.

23:47.138 --> 23:52.769
Er, Paul, we know
more about the moon
than we know about this loch.

23:52.852 --> 23:55.521
It's almost a thousand
feet deep in places

23:55.605 --> 23:59.650
and no one has ever
been down there. Ever.

23:59.734 --> 24:03.905
I would be more surprised
if it didn't hold some
extraordinary secret.

24:07.784 --> 24:10.203
Have you ever seen
anything yourself?

24:13.539 --> 24:14.624
No.

24:18.378 --> 24:19.545
Sadly.

25:28.239 --> 25:30.408
(CROWS CAWING)

25:33.161 --> 25:34.829
(RUMBLING)

25:45.340 --> 25:46.632
(CREATURE MOANING)

26:33.388 --> 26:34.430
Paul?

26:37.684 --> 26:38.935
I think I'm going mad.

26:42.438 --> 26:44.190
I saw the Water Horse
last night.

26:45.024 --> 26:46.025
Ah.

26:47.985 --> 26:48.986
Right.

26:50.780 --> 26:52.073
I'll get my jacket.

26:53.324 --> 26:54.492
Where are we going?

26:57.662 --> 26:59.497
Are you ready?

26:59.580 --> 27:00.581
For what?

27:16.931 --> 27:18.099
PAUL: A Water Horse.

27:19.600 --> 27:20.977
What's it doing here?

27:21.060 --> 27:24.480
Oh, they've been in that loch
a long, long time, son.

27:24.564 --> 27:26.482
You're not the first
person to have seen it.

27:27.400 --> 27:28.985
-Have you?
-Nope.

27:29.068 --> 27:30.570
But you still believe in it?

27:30.653 --> 27:33.573
I've never seen
the Queen either,
but I believe in her.

27:33.656 --> 27:36.075
But you never said anything,
even yesterday.

27:36.159 --> 27:39.662
We don't talk about it.
Never have.

27:39.746 --> 27:41.998
At best, folk think
you're mad,

27:42.957 --> 27:45.126
and at worst they believe you

27:45.209 --> 27:46.794
and the place gets overrun.

27:49.339 --> 27:51.341
No, I have never seen it.

27:55.136 --> 27:56.804
But you hear it
from time to time.

27:58.473 --> 28:03.061
Weird sound, like nothing
you've ever heard before.

28:05.646 --> 28:08.900
You're a very lucky man,
blessed you might say.

28:10.526 --> 28:13.988
But you really
don't understand
what it means, do you?

28:17.200 --> 28:18.201
No.

28:29.420 --> 28:31.381
No, I don't understand.

28:33.925 --> 28:36.719
What do you want
from the Water Horse, Paul?

28:39.597 --> 28:40.640
Want?

28:40.723 --> 28:41.724
Mmm.

28:46.854 --> 28:48.606
I don't know
what you mean, Golly.

28:51.401 --> 28:53.194
I've got work to do.

29:17.260 --> 29:19.012
-Good day for it.
-Ah!

29:20.972 --> 29:23.224
Well, now, er, you're assuming
she likes sunshine.

29:23.307 --> 29:25.476
-I reckon she prefers rain.
-She?

29:25.560 --> 29:28.146
Oh, you think
it's female, do you?

29:28.229 --> 29:31.441
An elusive creature pursued
by men at great cost
for little reward?

29:31.524 --> 29:33.401
No, no, no,
she's a female all right.

29:33.484 --> 29:34.527
Redhead probably.

29:34.610 --> 29:36.362
(CHUCKLES)

29:36.446 --> 29:38.281
Have you got room, er,
for a little one?

29:39.574 --> 29:41.993
-You want to come?
-Yeah, why not?

29:42.076 --> 29:44.078
Don't tell me
you've been bitten
by the bug in the night.

29:44.162 --> 29:46.748
Well, let's just say,
I, um...

29:46.831 --> 29:47.999
Woke up with an open mind.

29:48.916 --> 29:50.251
Might be a bit cramped.

29:53.171 --> 29:56.549
Erm, you wanted to be back
by midday anyway,

29:56.632 --> 29:59.093
so, erm, why not let Paul on?

29:59.177 --> 30:00.928
Yeah, right.

30:01.012 --> 30:03.931
-Are you sure that's okay?
-Are you kidding?

30:04.015 --> 30:05.808
I haven't had
a day off in months.

30:06.434 --> 30:07.435
Happy hunting.

to Glenbogle,

30:43.054 --> 30:44.597
Oh, no, no, oh.

30:46.224 --> 30:48.393
Well, that's done that
good and proper, hasn't it?

30:48.476 --> 30:50.395
-I'll get us off.
-(CHUCKLES) Right.

30:57.068 --> 30:58.695
(GRUNTS)

30:58.778 --> 31:00.780
I've got a feeling
we're gonna find something,
you know.

31:00.863 --> 31:03.408
Yes, er, Paul,
there's something
you ought to know.

31:03.491 --> 31:05.910
I've spent 10 years
searching for the smoking gun.

31:05.993 --> 31:08.663
I don't think
we're going to find it
on the first morning.

31:16.713 --> 31:17.755
I saw her, Simon.

31:18.923 --> 31:20.967
-Last night.
-Really?

31:21.050 --> 31:22.969
Just as the sun was setting.

31:23.052 --> 31:25.263
-Not far from here.
-You saw a Plesiosaur?

31:25.346 --> 31:27.181
I can't tell you
what it was like.

31:28.474 --> 31:30.018
The way it made me feel.

31:30.101 --> 31:32.854
Hold on, Paul.
There's something
I have to tell you.

31:32.937 --> 31:34.689
Um, what you saw...

31:36.691 --> 31:39.277
No, you were in a highly
suggestible state.

31:39.360 --> 31:40.903
You know, you'd had
half a bottle of wine.

31:40.987 --> 31:42.864
No, I know what I saw.

31:42.947 --> 31:44.532
You saw what
you wanted to see.

31:44.615 --> 31:48.286
-With all respect.
-I saw her, Simon.

31:48.369 --> 31:51.956
Excuse me, I'd rather trust
my instruments. (CHUCKLES)

32:31.287 --> 32:33.414
Golly, what are you doing?

32:34.957 --> 32:36.793
What the devil is he up to?

32:36.876 --> 32:40.171
Golly, you're spying on Bill.
That's awful.

32:45.218 --> 32:47.011
MOLLY: What's he doing?

32:47.095 --> 32:48.680
I'm going to find out.

32:49.597 --> 32:50.598
Wait.

32:57.021 --> 32:58.606
I wondered what the smoke was.

33:00.566 --> 33:02.819
You know, where I come from,
it's kind of a signal.

33:04.821 --> 33:07.031
Looks nice.
Where did you get the trout?

33:07.115 --> 33:09.117
Your river.

33:09.200 --> 33:11.744
You want to watch out,
I hear the Ghillie's

33:11.828 --> 33:13.746
And visiting scientists.

33:13.830 --> 33:14.914
I won't detain you.

33:14.997 --> 33:17.542
Oh, please do.
I'll come quietly.

33:21.796 --> 33:24.215

of yourself, aren't you?

33:24.298 --> 33:27.552
(CHUCKLES)
Not as much as you think.

33:27.635 --> 33:31.556
I know you think this job
is a blessing for the kind of
guy you think I am.

33:31.639 --> 33:33.224
It isn't.

33:33.307 --> 33:37.103
Don't get me wrong,
the work fascinates me,
but the pay is lousy,

33:37.186 --> 33:39.605
I live in a tent

33:39.689 --> 33:43.276
and, strange as it sounds,
I don't really fancy Simon.

33:43.359 --> 33:44.360
(CHUCKLES)

33:46.738 --> 33:50.074
Jess, you're wonderful

33:51.659 --> 33:55.246

and in that order.

33:55.329 --> 33:56.748
So why don't...

33:56.831 --> 33:58.833
Oh, for goodness' sake,
Bill, will you just shut up?

34:07.967 --> 34:09.302
What about lunch?

34:10.303 --> 34:12.347
This'll do for starters.

here at Glenbogle House,

35:09.445 --> 35:12.073
we believe the public
should be able to come
and watch them at work.

in the unique atmosphere
of this ancient loch

35:14.951 --> 35:17.286
and maybe even catch a glimpse
of old Boglie himself.

It's Simon.

-But...

35:30.717 --> 35:31.718

The lungs of a massive
air-breathing creature.

36:08.587 --> 36:10.381
I've never seen
anything like it.

36:10.465 --> 36:12.216
It's so clear.
So sharply defined.

36:12.299 --> 36:13.760
This is only
the beginning, of course.

36:13.842 --> 36:16.220
We'd need
an intensive programme
of testing and research.

36:16.304 --> 36:19.097
Which could take weeks.
Maybe even months.

36:19.182 --> 36:21.267
If that's okay with you, Paul.

36:21.351 --> 36:22.643
Yeah, yeah, of course. I mean,

36:22.726 --> 36:24.187
you'd obviously
get funding for it, right?

36:24.270 --> 36:26.522
With this
and Amy's photograph,

36:26.606 --> 36:28.399
I'm certain of it.

36:28.483 --> 36:29.734
Fantastic.

36:29.817 --> 36:32.278
Couldn't it be
an old wreck or something?

36:32.362 --> 36:34.530
-Something with air pockets?
-No way.

36:34.614 --> 36:36.032
Well, what about weeds, then?

Anything is possible, Iona,
but some things are more
possible than others.

36:42.080 --> 36:45.291
Oh, right. Like a survivor
from prehistory, you mean?

36:45.375 --> 36:47.085
-Iona!
-No, no,
that's all right, Paul,

36:47.168 --> 36:49.629
I'm used to scepticism.
In fact,
I often practise it myself.

36:49.712 --> 36:54.425
No, I hope that one day I will
be able to prove my hypothesis
to you beyond all doubt.

36:54.509 --> 36:55.718
Well, where did you
find it then?

36:58.054 --> 36:59.764

is a science centre,

-Er, must we?

important, Simon.

we'll be world famous.

to tell him, or shall I?

I don't believe it.

40:28.931 --> 40:29.932
You lied to me.

I welcomed you
here as a friend.

40:35.021 --> 40:36.147
I'm sorry.

40:36.230 --> 40:37.857
And you treated me
like a fool.

I've ever done.

I did it, not just for
my benefit, but for Bill and
the rest of the research team.

to do the same when
you were in trouble, Paul?

I am sorry.

41:07.387 --> 41:10.848
But I did it because I believe
passionately in what

go and get changed.

47:44.575 --> 47:47.245
-I was doing something.
-I know you were.

47:47.328 --> 47:49.122
And I've learned more about
you in the last few days...

47:49.205 --> 47:51.708
-Then why?
-Because you have to listen
to your conscience, Ewan.

47:51.791 --> 47:54.127
You have to do what
you think is right.

47:54.210 --> 47:55.920
I couldn't live
with myself if I didn't.

47:59.298 --> 48:00.299
All right?

48:05.596 --> 48:06.848
As a matter of fact...

48:07.932 --> 48:09.017
Yeah?

48:09.100 --> 48:10.768
There's a bit
of a silver lining.

48:13.354 --> 48:16.274
MOLLY: Oh, well, you have
to start dipping your toe
in the water again sometime.

48:16.357 --> 48:17.692
I agree.

48:17.775 --> 48:19.694
I can't go on pining for
Duncan forever, can I?

48:19.777 --> 48:22.864
That is just what I was
saying to your father.

48:22.947 --> 48:26.159
And there's something
I will never forget.

48:26.242 --> 48:27.744
Oh, what's that?

48:27.827 --> 48:29.370
He was a lovely kisser.

48:30.872 --> 48:32.623
I'm not sure
I wanted to know that.

48:33.708 --> 48:35.918
Mr MacDonald,

48:36.002 --> 48:37.795
the curse of modern life

48:37.879 --> 48:42.300
is that we complicate things
that are actually very simple.

48:42.383 --> 48:44.552
You mean I can exist
without an accountant?

48:44.635 --> 48:47.055
(SCOFFS) Of course not,
don't be absurd.

48:47.138 --> 48:51.642
But if Mr Micawber can grasp
the point, I'm sure you can.

48:51.726 --> 48:57.023
To wit,
if you cannot earn more
you must spend less.

48:57.732 --> 48:59.400
Spend less?

48:59.484 --> 49:01.736
If we pull our belts
any tighter our legs
will fall off.

49:01.819 --> 49:02.820
Ah.

49:03.821 --> 49:06.657
You have bad eyesight.

49:06.741 --> 49:09.077
-No.
-Yet you have two lamps on.

49:15.792 --> 49:18.628
Do you own
a thick woollen sweater?

49:18.711 --> 49:19.754
Yes.

49:19.837 --> 49:22.924
Then, I suggest you wear it.

49:25.843 --> 49:26.886
Anything else?

49:26.969 --> 49:30.014
You always pay
your bills promptly.

49:30.098 --> 49:32.642
Garage, insurance,
household maintenance.

49:32.725 --> 49:36.437
Did it never
occur to you to negotiate?

49:36.521 --> 49:39.107
-Negotiate?
-Haggle.

49:39.190 --> 49:42.193
You'd be surprised how
accommodating people can be.

49:42.276 --> 49:43.277
Oh.

49:44.904 --> 49:45.988
Oh, I see.

49:47.699 --> 49:50.535
Well, perhaps we can
start with your fee then.

49:50.618 --> 49:55.456
Shall we say,
75% of what you asked for?

49:55.540 --> 50:00.920
I have a painful sensation
of having just been
hoist by my own petard.

50:01.004 --> 50:03.214
Perhaps we'd better
look at the income again.

50:04.674 --> 50:06.009
Â£110.

50:10.680 --> 50:12.098
Amy?

50:12.181 --> 50:14.100
Amy, what was that about?

50:14.183 --> 50:16.185
I didn't do it for me,
I did it for you.

50:16.269 --> 50:18.813
I know it's not much
but every little helps,
doesn't it?

50:19.772 --> 50:20.773
Amy.

50:21.482 --> 50:22.817
Amy, come here.

50:25.611 --> 50:28.489
You shouldn't have done that
but I'm grateful that you did.

50:28.573 --> 50:32.118
-I just wanted to help.
-I know. And you have.

50:32.201 --> 50:34.620
And I'm not just
talking about the money.

50:34.704 --> 50:37.540
But it's back to school
tomorrow and from now on,

50:37.623 --> 50:39.500
complete honesty
between us, okay?

50:39.584 --> 50:40.668
Are you sure about that?

50:40.752 --> 50:42.045
Yeah, of course I'm sure.

50:42.128 --> 50:43.379
That shirt's shocking.

50:44.047 --> 50:45.757
(CHUCKLES)

50:45.840 --> 50:48.843
I'm going to help
Ewan with something.
Are you coming?

50:48.926 --> 50:51.012
Er, yeah, yeah, in a minute.

50:56.100 --> 50:57.894
PAUL: What are you doing?

50:57.977 --> 51:00.063
Well, the work's
all done now, so...

51:01.272 --> 51:02.565
I'm moving back home.

51:03.608 --> 51:04.984
Well, what about the window?

51:05.068 --> 51:08.696
I think the window's probably
fine where it is, but...

51:08.780 --> 51:10.865
Thanks for your
helpful suggestion.

51:13.618 --> 51:15.244
I'll be sad to see you go.

51:16.829 --> 51:17.830
Um...

51:18.915 --> 51:21.292
I'm going to miss you.

51:21.376 --> 51:24.837
I thought that you
might be sick of the sight
of me by now.

51:24.921 --> 51:26.339
(CHUCKLES)

51:26.422 --> 51:28.716
Anyway, it's not
far away and...

51:29.467 --> 51:31.678
You're welcome anytime.

51:32.804 --> 51:34.430
Listen, thanks for...

51:35.890 --> 51:37.517
Well, everything.

51:37.600 --> 51:39.560
Especially the last few days.

51:39.644 --> 51:43.481
You seem different somehow.

51:43.564 --> 51:45.483
I don't quite know
what it is, but...

51:46.234 --> 51:47.485
-Do I?
-Yeah.

51:48.653 --> 51:50.238
Well, I feel...

51:53.741 --> 51:55.827
-I feel at peace now.
-Mmm.

52:00.790 --> 52:04.460
Well, come on, you have
to help me get this couch in.

52:04.544 --> 52:06.713
Couch?
I'm not lending you a couch.

52:06.796 --> 52:09.257
(GIGGLES) You are. You said.

52:09.340 --> 52:11.134
So this guy comes up
to me and he says,

52:11.217 --> 52:12.593
"I like your
chocolate monsters."

52:12.677 --> 52:14.470
I said, "Thanks very much."

52:14.554 --> 52:15.972
He says, "What's your recipe?"

52:16.055 --> 52:19.809
And I said, "That's between
me and my Moulinex."

52:19.892 --> 52:22.687
Then he says, "I'll make
it worth your while, son."

52:22.770 --> 52:25.106
Turns out he runs
a confectionery
business in Dundee.

52:25.189 --> 52:26.983
-(ALL LAUGHING)
-Heavens!

52:27.066 --> 52:30.153
So, he's asked me to develop
a whole range of the beasties,
you know,

52:30.236 --> 52:31.696
different flavours and stuff,

52:31.779 --> 52:34.240
and he's prepared to pay
big time for the recipes.

52:34.323 --> 52:36.534
-Hooray.
-(ALL CHEERING)

52:36.617 --> 52:37.869
Pay the Estate, that is.

52:37.952 --> 52:40.913
-No, go on, 50-50.
-(ALL LAUGHING)

52:40.997 --> 52:42.165
Bit generous, aren't you?

52:42.248 --> 52:44.500
All right, so now we
come to the tasting.

52:44.584 --> 52:47.420
Now, it's a speed tasting
so the first to gulp down
the monster gets a second.

52:49.088 --> 52:51.090
Now we have
marzipan, peppermint,

52:51.174 --> 52:53.676
orange, lime, raspberry
and for Golly,

52:53.760 --> 52:55.511
the haggis flavour.

52:55.595 --> 52:57.347
Hey, he hasn't said go yet!

52:57.430 --> 52:58.556
On your marks,

52:59.432 --> 53:01.517
set, eat those monsters!

53:01.601 --> 53:03.770
(ALL LAUGHING)

53:11.903 --> 53:14.655
-And it's Paul,
by a long neck.
-(ALL CHEERING)

53:15.281 --> 53:16.949
JESS: Cheat!

53:17.033 --> 53:18.284
GOLLY: Very nice.

53:20.411 --> 53:21.829
(ALL LAUGHING)
