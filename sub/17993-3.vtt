00:02.902 --> 00:05.305
{\an8}Previously on "Love &amp; Hip-Hop:
Hollywood"...

00:05.372 --> 00:06.906
{\an8}Teairra reached out to me.

00:06.973 --> 00:08.007
{\an7}What she
reach out about?

00:08.074 --> 00:09.376
{\an8}I mean, I had posted
on Instagram about

00:09.442 --> 00:12.112
{\an8}my grandfather passing,
so at least to me,

00:12.178 --> 00:13.780
{\an8}it's like, I still
know she got a heart.

00:13.847 --> 00:16.616
{\an7}I feel like we could,
you know...

00:16.683 --> 00:18.051
{\an9}Be friends?

00:16.683 --> 00:18.051
{\an7}Yes.

00:18.118 --> 00:19.319
{\an8}You can come out
with me.

00:19.386 --> 00:20.954
{\an7}I don't really care
what Ray feels right now.

00:21.020 --> 00:22.255
{\an8}I'm doing me.

00:22.322 --> 00:25.892
{\an7}I spoke with Teairra,
and she was right about you.

00:25.959 --> 00:29.496
{\an7}What you doing about, you know,
coming to stay with me?

00:29.562 --> 00:31.631
{\an7}Like, I want you to move in,
I want us to be together.

00:31.698 --> 00:34.000
{\an8}I'm not ready to necessarily
take that step yet with you.

00:35.568 --> 00:38.671
{\an7}You know, Nia's my girl, but
when I'm on the road, I ain't--

00:38.738 --> 00:40.306
{\an7}I ain't gonna lie,
I mean, yeah, it happens.

00:40.373 --> 00:41.241
{\an8}You know what I'm saying?

00:40.373 --> 00:41.241
{\an9}Right.

00:41.307 --> 00:42.709
{\an8}She understands what it is.

00:42.776 --> 00:45.378
{\an8}I've been on and off
with Soulja Boy.

00:45.445 --> 00:47.280
{\an8}What?

00:47.347 --> 00:48.448
{\an7}Are y'all (bleep)
or what, girl?

00:48.515 --> 00:49.883
{\an8}'Cause I like to know
the juicy questions.

00:49.949 --> 00:52.619
{\an8}Yes, we definitely were,
a couple-- two weeks ago?

00:52.685 --> 00:53.987
{\an8}Just do it, bitch, do it!

00:54.053 --> 00:55.755
{\an7}Go fix
your teeth, ho!

00:55.822 --> 00:58.425
{\an7}You're just (bleep)
my (bleep) you kissing him!

{\an8}(Teairra)
I have my hands full.

01:37.864 --> 01:40.366
I find myself caught
in between my ex,

01:40.433 --> 01:42.635
who tried to destroy me
on one side,

01:42.702 --> 01:45.305
{\an8}and the girl who took him
from me on the other side.

01:45.371 --> 01:47.774
I realize that there's
someone out there

01:47.841 --> 01:49.542
who used to be a real friend

01:49.609 --> 01:51.478
that I can't afford
to let go of.

01:51.544 --> 01:53.246
{\an1}Hello...

01:53.313 --> 01:54.814
Hi, how are you?

01:54.881 --> 01:56.649
{\an5}(Hazel-E)
When Teairra hit me up
to go have drinks,

01:56.716 --> 01:58.151
I was a little shocked,

01:58.218 --> 02:01.020
but she did reach out regarding
my grandfather's funeral,

02:01.087 --> 02:02.489
and I appreciate that.

02:02.555 --> 02:03.723
{\an8}But I figured...

02:03.790 --> 02:05.692
{\an8}I guess I can go and meet her.

02:05.758 --> 02:07.126
Maybe I can finally
get some closure

02:07.193 --> 02:09.429
to this Berg situation
once and for all.

02:09.496 --> 02:10.797
How are you?

02:10.864 --> 02:13.399
You know how it is,
like, when death happens.

02:13.466 --> 02:15.869
{\an4}Yes.

02:13.466 --> 02:15.869
You realize
how short life is.

02:15.935 --> 02:18.938
Like... first,
I want to say thank you

02:19.005 --> 02:20.740
for reaching
out and everything.

02:20.807 --> 02:25.678
{\an1}But where we left off was on
this whole "fun size" situation

02:25.745 --> 02:28.781
and, you know, that's some
harsh allegations that,

02:28.848 --> 02:30.817
{\an5}you know, were
brought upon you.

02:28.848 --> 02:30.817
{\an1}It is.

02:30.884 --> 02:31.818
So imagine how I feel.

02:31.885 --> 02:33.119
And it's just like,

02:33.186 --> 02:35.655
the relationship was
inappropriate, like...

02:35.722 --> 02:38.458
{\an1}Okay, as far as the record goes,
that's a whole nother story.

02:38.525 --> 02:42.595
{\an1}But if you think that I got
on my mother(bleep) knees

02:42.662 --> 02:46.466
{\an1}in an alley with sticks,
stones, and debris...

02:46.533 --> 02:48.167
you crazy as hell.

02:48.234 --> 02:51.271
I knew T.T. would never
admit to going down on Berg,

02:51.337 --> 02:54.107
and quite frankly,
I still don't believe it.

02:54.173 --> 02:57.410
And even though I'm beyond
over that little boy,

02:57.477 --> 02:59.712
I just wish she could finally
own up to her (bleep)

02:59.779 --> 03:01.814
and be real
about the situation.

03:01.881 --> 03:04.384
The fact that it's even
allegations on you (bleep)

03:04.450 --> 03:06.586
fun size up, or whatever,
in the alley,

03:06.653 --> 03:08.388
it's just
absolutely crazy to me.

03:08.454 --> 03:10.957
{\an1}But Berg is a liar,
Hazel!

03:11.024 --> 03:12.525
{\an5}He's a liar, but you--

03:11.024 --> 03:12.525
Why can't you see that?

03:12.592 --> 03:14.160
{\an6}No, he is--

03:12.592 --> 03:14.160
He lied to you!

03:14.227 --> 03:16.195
He is a liar,
and he lied to you!

03:16.262 --> 03:18.631
{\an5}Okay, so we--

03:16.262 --> 03:18.631
Or lied <i> on</i> you,

03:18.698 --> 03:19.732
{\an5}We can both say--

03:18.698 --> 03:19.732
either which one it was.

03:19.799 --> 03:21.501
{\an1}We can both say
that he's a liar.

03:21.568 --> 03:23.269
Right.
We can agree on that.

03:23.336 --> 03:25.238
Okay, so to move on.
What is to move on?

03:25.305 --> 03:26.706
{\an1}'Cause we can't keep
going back here.

03:26.773 --> 03:27.874
Well, I mean,
because, to move on--

03:27.941 --> 03:29.075
'Cause I ain't gonna
say nothing different

03:29.142 --> 03:30.109
{\an1}and you ain't gonna
feel nothing different.

03:30.176 --> 03:31.511
And that's what I'm say--

03:31.578 --> 03:32.812
That's the whole point
of right now.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.113
{\an5}What is the point?

03:32.879 --> 03:34.113
{\an3}Exactly.

03:34.180 --> 03:36.816
I just want you to be
able to admit, like,

03:36.883 --> 03:40.153
"Okay, what I did, whatever
the situation was with him,

03:40.219 --> 03:41.321
was inappropriate."

03:41.387 --> 03:43.323
And I can say that
I'm wrong for how,

03:43.389 --> 03:45.391
{\an1}you know,
I befriended him.

03:45.458 --> 03:47.193
{\an5}I am wrong for that.

03:45.458 --> 03:47.193
Okay, thank you.

03:47.260 --> 03:48.461
{\an5}So I give you that.

03:47.260 --> 03:48.461
Thank you.

03:48.528 --> 03:50.196
{\an1}And I don't have a problem
with giving you that,

03:50.263 --> 03:51.931
{\an4}you know what I'm saying,
because that's just
real (bleep).

03:51.998 --> 03:53.900
I don't know if me and Teairra
could ever be as tight

03:53.967 --> 03:56.903
as we used to be or if I could
ever trust her again,

03:56.970 --> 04:01.441
but for now, I'm gonna put
this (bleep) in the rear view.

04:01.507 --> 04:02.475
Wrong is wrong,
right is right.

04:02.542 --> 04:03.676
Wrong is wrong,
right is right.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.278
{\an1}I won't cross boundaries
with you,

04:05.345 --> 04:07.614
{\an1}and I ask for you
to do the same.

04:07.680 --> 04:10.216
{\an1}If we could do that,
we can move on.

04:10.283 --> 04:12.719
{\an6}All right.

04:10.283 --> 04:12.719
And we can trust
each other again.

04:12.785 --> 04:15.521
{\an1}You ain't got no nother friend
like me and you know that.

04:15.588 --> 04:16.889
{\an5}And you know that, too.

04:15.588 --> 04:16.889
And vice versa.

04:16.956 --> 04:18.156
Okay, so that's
what I'm saying.

04:18.224 --> 04:19.826
So then that's
what I'm saying, so...

04:19.892 --> 04:21.527
{\an1}You will never
find a bitch like T.T.

04:21.594 --> 04:22.962
You're right on that.

04:23.029 --> 04:24.731
Even though she crazy,
you know what I'm saying?

04:24.797 --> 04:26.466
{\an1}Yeah, and you crazy, too,
in your own way.

04:26.532 --> 04:28.601
Yeah, I have my own--
My own cuts, too.

04:28.668 --> 04:30.236
Right, so what
I'm saying is,

04:30.303 --> 04:32.372
{\an1}let's not cross boundaries
with each other

04:32.438 --> 04:34.340
and we can move forward.

04:34.407 --> 04:35.808
{\an1}And that's being two adults
about the situation,

04:35.875 --> 04:36.843
you know what I'm saying?

04:36.909 --> 04:37.977
But we have to be adults.

04:38.044 --> 04:39.846
It's a cold world
out here, honey.

04:39.912 --> 04:41.881
It is-- it's Hollywood.
The streets is mean, baby.

04:41.948 --> 04:44.484
Everybody looking for
their next come-up.

04:44.550 --> 04:45.818
{\an1}No, they tried it.
They tried it.

04:45.885 --> 04:47.153
And we can cheers
to mother(bleep) that now.

04:47.220 --> 04:48.321
{\an5}Cheers to that then.

04:47.220 --> 04:48.321
{\an3}Okay.

04:49.822 --> 04:52.759
♪♪

04:55.228 --> 04:57.363
{\an8}When crazy women
got me all (bleep) up,

04:57.430 --> 04:59.098
{\an8}I always tend to call Lil B.

04:59.165 --> 05:00.433
{\an8}She's like a sister to me,

05:00.500 --> 05:03.136
{\an8}and ain't nobody crazier
than she is.

05:06.472 --> 05:08.975
God broke the mold
when he made Lil B.

05:09.042 --> 05:11.944
She's like no other woman,
and you gotta love her for it.

05:12.011 --> 05:13.579
{\an6}Hey, Ray.

05:12.011 --> 05:13.579
{\an1}Lil B!

05:13.646 --> 05:15.415
How's it going,
family?

05:15.481 --> 05:17.050
{\an4}Yeah?

05:15.481 --> 05:17.050
{\an3}Yeah.

05:17.116 --> 05:18.384
Hey, Bugatti!

05:18.451 --> 05:21.254
It's your girl Brandi,
your rapper, actress,

05:21.320 --> 05:25.825
{\an8}the wife to uber-producer
Max Lux.

05:25.892 --> 05:29.562
I am the goddaughter of the one
and only Miss Whitney Houston.

05:29.629 --> 05:31.764
Yes, that's correct,
Miss Whitney Houston.

05:31.831 --> 05:35.301
I have known Ray J
for a very long time.

05:35.368 --> 05:38.738
Whitney was a very huge force
in the both of our lives.

05:38.805 --> 05:42.642
When he called me to say he
was having relationship issues,

05:42.709 --> 05:44.944
I definitely
made myself available.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.213
{\an1}Now I'm trying to figure out
this whole thing with Princess,

05:47.280 --> 05:48.481
'cause as-- as--

05:48.548 --> 05:49.716
{\an5}What's going on with Princess?

05:48.548 --> 05:49.716
Well, listen.

05:49.782 --> 05:50.783
I'm finding out,

05:50.850 --> 05:52.385
{\an1}she hanging out
with Teairra Marie.

05:52.452 --> 05:53.686
She hanging out with who?

05:53.753 --> 05:55.755
Teairra hanging out
with Princess?

05:55.822 --> 05:57.990
Somebody pinch me
before I wake up,

05:58.057 --> 05:59.759
because that's
some bull(bleep).

05:59.826 --> 06:01.761
I mean, I was tight with T.T.

06:01.828 --> 06:03.529
when she was dating Ray,

06:03.596 --> 06:05.898
and let's just
put it like this.

06:05.965 --> 06:08.768
I love the girl,
but Teairra can go from,

06:08.835 --> 06:11.471
"Hi, sweetie,"
to, "Bitch, please!"

06:11.537 --> 06:14.273
So, Princess, watch your back.

06:14.340 --> 06:17.877
I got your back,
but watch that mother(bleep).

06:17.944 --> 06:19.178
So Teairra called me.

06:19.245 --> 06:21.614
{\an1}She like, "Yo, I got her
over Drake house.

06:21.681 --> 06:23.216
I got her doing this."

06:23.282 --> 06:24.650
I'm like, "Look, Teairra,

06:24.717 --> 06:27.620
{\an1}just continue to give me
information if it's out there."

06:27.687 --> 06:30.056
{\an1}But my thing is, when
she telling me this (bleep),

06:30.123 --> 06:32.191
I halfway believe it
and I halfway don't,

06:32.258 --> 06:33.760
{\an1}'cause I know how janky
she been.

06:33.826 --> 06:35.695
{\an5}Princess, no.

06:33.826 --> 06:35.695
{\an1}Like, you know what?
It's just-- it's just--

06:35.762 --> 06:37.864
{\an1}If she don't get in line
and understand

06:37.930 --> 06:40.733
that it's supposed to be me and
her, then it is what it is, man.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.769
You know what? This whole
Princess and Teairra (bleep)

06:42.835 --> 06:45.671
got me (bleep) up, and so I'm
happy Lil B is talking to me,

06:45.738 --> 06:46.639
'cause you know what?

06:46.706 --> 06:47.974
She's always there for me.

06:48.040 --> 06:49.408
And I love her for that.

06:49.475 --> 06:51.744
How's the family?
How Max Lux doing?

06:51.811 --> 06:53.146
Working in the studio.

06:53.212 --> 06:54.847
{\an1}We about to do some (bleep)
together, me and Lux.

06:54.914 --> 06:56.716
{\an3}Oh... okay.

06:56.783 --> 06:58.818
{\an5}You ain't know that?

06:56.783 --> 06:58.818
{\an3}No.

06:58.885 --> 07:00.686
{\an1}That's cool, like,
I love y'all, like, y'all--

07:00.753 --> 07:01.888
What's the problem?

07:01.954 --> 07:03.356
Y'all get together
and it's just...

07:03.422 --> 07:05.291
brings back other memories.

07:05.358 --> 07:06.926
{\an5}Flashbacks to--

07:05.358 --> 07:06.926
Other memories like what?

07:06.993 --> 07:08.528
To the girls,
all these blondes.

07:08.594 --> 07:09.996
{\an5}What's wrong with blondes?

07:08.594 --> 07:09.996
And you're my family, too.

07:10.062 --> 07:12.732
{\an5}(Brandi)
Max has been good
for a very long time,

07:12.799 --> 07:18.671
but I am very nervous about
when he and Ray are together.

07:18.738 --> 07:22.875
I do not need my happily married
husband getting off

07:22.942 --> 07:27.680
into any temptations or
distractions that gets him off

07:27.747 --> 07:31.417
of that happily married life
we have been living.

07:31.484 --> 07:34.287
{\an1}You can't keep being
overanxious with everything.

07:34.353 --> 07:36.355
{\an1}Especially, like,
with you and Max, like,

07:36.422 --> 07:38.324
{\an1}y'all been together for,
like, 10 years.

07:38.391 --> 07:39.325
11.

07:39.392 --> 07:41.294
{\an1}Like, damn,
like, over a decade.

07:41.360 --> 07:43.830
{\an1}At some point, you gotta
let a (bleep) chill.

07:43.896 --> 07:45.198
I been in and out,
through it,

07:45.264 --> 07:48.601
{\an1}up and down with
infidelities, the whole nine,

07:48.668 --> 07:50.903
but me and Max
is still 11 years strong.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.205
And one thing
I'll tell you,

07:52.271 --> 07:55.208
if I let the next bitch
get to me,

07:55.274 --> 07:58.077
me and Max might
not have lasted,

07:58.144 --> 08:00.513
{\an1}but I'm not gonna let nobody
mess up my foundation

08:00.580 --> 08:02.048
when I know one thing,

08:02.114 --> 08:04.283
is my (bleep) love me
and I love him.

08:04.350 --> 08:05.718

08:05.785 --> 08:06.919
And you love Princess and
Princess love you and...

08:06.986 --> 08:08.521
{\an5}But you, Lil B...

08:08.588 --> 08:09.555

08:08.588 --> 08:09.555
Go get your woman.

08:09.622 --> 08:10.723
You gotta calm down.

08:10.790 --> 08:12.925
Go get-- look...
Go get your woman.

08:12.992 --> 08:14.093
Go talk to Princess

{\an8}talking all type of (bleep),

08:41.721 --> 08:44.056
{\an8}it really got me thinking that
Dre is really not being honest

08:44.123 --> 08:45.925
{\an8}with me about
our relationship.

08:45.992 --> 08:48.227
{\an1}How do you think
the video's going so far?

08:50.663 --> 08:52.798
{\an4}What's up?

08:50.663 --> 08:52.798

08:54.166 --> 08:55.501

08:55.568 --> 08:57.536
So when Dre told me
that he was doing a video shoot

08:57.603 --> 08:59.705
at his house, I decided
to pop up on him

08:59.772 --> 09:01.974
so I could get
some answers face to face.

09:02.041 --> 09:03.409
We need to talk.

09:03.476 --> 09:04.744
Talk about what?

09:04.810 --> 09:06.145
{\an1}Us.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.546
{\an1}This back and forth
(bleep).

09:07.613 --> 09:09.849
What you mean?
Back and forth, what?

09:09.916 --> 09:11.317
Back and forth with us.

09:11.384 --> 09:15.288
{\an1}I was just with you and two
weeks later, I see you and Nia.

09:15.354 --> 09:16.589
Man, you tweakin'.

09:16.656 --> 09:18.424
{\an5}Man, I'm tweakin'.

09:16.656 --> 09:18.424
You trippin'.

09:18.491 --> 09:20.660
{\an5}You already know
what the relationship is
with me and Nia, though.

09:20.726 --> 09:22.161
{\an1}Oh, now you're in
a relationship with her?

09:22.228 --> 09:23.996
{\an4}Because two weeks ago,
when you was (bleep) me,
you weren't.

09:24.063 --> 09:25.464
I'm gonna do what I do.

09:25.531 --> 09:26.832
{\an1}If you would have been
acting right, this wouldn't--

09:26.899 --> 09:27.934
none of this (bleep)
would have been happening.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.535
{\an1}What?
You're not making no sense.

09:29.602 --> 09:31.837
{\an1}"Soulja Boy, you back and
forth, Dre, you back and--"

09:31.904 --> 09:33.673
No, my (bleep),
you with the (bleep).

09:33.739 --> 09:34.941
{\an5}I'm with the (bleep)?

09:33.739 --> 09:34.941
You're with the (bleep).

09:35.007 --> 09:36.542
You gotta check yourself
before you can check me.

09:36.609 --> 09:37.944
{\an5}You can't check me.

09:36.609 --> 09:37.944
{\an1}Yo, what are you
talking about?

09:38.010 --> 09:39.712
Like, you sound (bleep).

09:39.779 --> 09:40.746
You're not perfect.

09:40.813 --> 09:41.981
I never said
I was perfect.

09:42.048 --> 09:43.983
I never said I was,
never said I was.

09:44.050 --> 09:45.251
So what you do?
You walking away from me?

09:45.318 --> 09:47.353
(Soulja Boy)
I feel like Nas is in violation.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.055
She knew me and Nia
was in a relationship.

09:49.121 --> 09:50.589
She know me and Nia dating.

09:50.656 --> 09:52.258
She trying to make it like
it's a big deal, like,

09:52.325 --> 09:54.627
"Oh, you won a case
'cause I had sex with you."

09:54.694 --> 09:57.196
Okay, so what?
We had sex. What else?

09:57.263 --> 09:59.665
If you wanna
fix whatever,

09:59.732 --> 10:01.200
you would do that,
that's all I gotta say.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.401
{\an5}I tried to fix--

10:01.267 --> 10:02.401
You don't want to.

10:02.468 --> 10:03.703
{\an5}How am I gonna fix--

10:02.468 --> 10:03.703
You here to press--

10:03.769 --> 10:04.837
{\an1}How am I gonna
fix something with you

10:04.904 --> 10:06.505
{\an1}when you're in a whole
other relationship

10:06.572 --> 10:07.974
with another person?

10:08.040 --> 10:09.475
{\an5}Please explain to me!

10:08.040 --> 10:09.475
At the end of the day...

10:09.542 --> 10:10.776
So I'm supposed to try
to be like, I love you

10:10.843 --> 10:13.045
{\an1}and be with you and build
what we have and all--

10:13.112 --> 10:15.147
all week, you rotate us?

10:15.214 --> 10:16.582
{\an1}And then next thing you know,
you're with her?

10:16.649 --> 10:17.750
Like, what sense
does that make?

10:17.817 --> 10:19.285
It's either you want
to fix me and you

10:19.352 --> 10:20.820
and we could work at this

10:20.886 --> 10:22.555
and put all that
(bleep) behind us,

10:22.621 --> 10:23.789
{\an5}But you acting like...

10:22.621 --> 10:23.789
or you could be with Nia

10:23.856 --> 10:25.124
{\an1}and then, like,
it is what it is.

10:25.191 --> 10:27.126
Don't deal with me.

10:27.193 --> 10:28.594
That's all I'm saying.

10:28.661 --> 10:30.496
Dre is talking out of
both sides of his mouth.

10:30.563 --> 10:32.031
One minute, he's saying
that he loves me

10:32.098 --> 10:34.233
and wants to be with me,
and then the other,

10:34.300 --> 10:36.335
he's talking
all this nonsense about Nia.

10:36.402 --> 10:39.238
Funny, while we're having sex,
all he talks about is me.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.307
{\an6}You done?

10:39.305 --> 10:41.307
Yes, I'm done.

10:41.374 --> 10:43.409
{\an5}At the end of the day,
if you feel like
I did you dirty,

10:43.476 --> 10:45.611
you feel (bleep) up
on what I did,

10:45.678 --> 10:47.346
you know what I'm saying,
(bleep) with her

10:47.413 --> 10:49.782
and (bleep) with you,
my bad, I'm sorry.

10:49.849 --> 10:51.217
You dig what I'm saying?
But at the end of the day,

10:51.283 --> 10:52.818
{\an1}all this poppin' up
at the video shoot (bleep),

10:52.885 --> 10:54.286
it ain't gonna happen
no more.

10:54.353 --> 10:56.555
I did this out of respect
for you... of what we had.

10:56.622 --> 10:58.891
But at the end of the day,
stop tweaking.

10:58.958 --> 11:00.059

I'm not tweaking.

11:00.126 --> 11:02.361

Kamiah is a model that
I've been dating.

12:05.991 --> 12:07.660
Nothing too serious,
but you know,

12:07.726 --> 12:10.796
she's a nice girl with a pretty
face, so who's complaining?

12:10.863 --> 12:12.164
This weekend,
I was out of town,

12:12.231 --> 12:13.566
so I left her my key

12:13.632 --> 12:16.001
so she could crash
at my pad for a few days.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.003
So I figured, once I got back
in town, you know,

12:18.070 --> 12:20.439
I'd pop up on her
so I can get my keys back.

12:20.506 --> 12:22.174

But when he went out of town,
things seemed to slow down a lot

13:04.350 --> 13:06.585

but seeing him again

13:06.652 --> 13:08.854

14:03.242 --> 14:05.644
and nothing is getting
in the way of that.

14:05.711 --> 14:06.612
What are you doing?

14:06.679 --> 14:08.447
{\an1}Getting ready
to hit the stu.

14:08.514 --> 14:09.815
Which means...

14:09.882 --> 14:12.017
it's probably
gonna be girls around.

14:12.084 --> 14:15.588
My name is Max Lux, and I'm
the hottest producer in L.A.

14:15.654 --> 14:18.224
{\an8}I wrote for Lil' Kim,
Usher, Flo Rida.

14:18.290 --> 14:19.892
{\an8}I even got songs
with Stevie Wonder.

14:19.959 --> 14:22.494
But sometimes, it's hard
to concentrate on my music

14:22.561 --> 14:24.096
when I gotta deal
with my crazy wife.

14:24.163 --> 14:27.399
She always up my ass about
where I'm at, what I'm doing,

14:27.466 --> 14:29.935
who I'm doing it with,
and I can't deal with it.

14:30.002 --> 14:31.737
Ain't no girls
at the studio,

14:31.804 --> 14:33.706
{\an1}and if there was
girls at the studio,

14:33.772 --> 14:36.375
{\an1}they're not for me, so you
don't have to worry about them.

14:36.442 --> 14:37.710
{\an5}Can I say this, baby?

14:36.442 --> 14:37.710
At the end of the day,

14:37.776 --> 14:40.012
{\an1}my job is what I do
for a living.

14:40.079 --> 14:42.081
{\an6}Right.

14:40.079 --> 14:42.081
In my industry,

14:42.147 --> 14:45.150
{\an1}you gotta go out and you gotta
stay out all night in the studio

14:45.217 --> 14:48.087
{\an4}and work all night, or it's
gonna be the next person
taking your spot.

14:48.153 --> 14:49.555
{\an1}Can you call me every
four hours, no matter what?

14:49.622 --> 14:51.490
{\an1}I can't call you every four
hours, but I'm gonna call you.

14:51.557 --> 14:54.293
{\an1}When I was 16, my curfew wasn't
even call every four hours.

14:54.360 --> 14:55.594
You got something to hide?

14:55.661 --> 14:57.329
{\an4}I don't have nothing
to hide.

14:55.661 --> 14:57.329
{\an3}Okay.

14:57.396 --> 14:59.231
{\an1}I just have a wife that
likes to go on the Internet

14:59.298 --> 15:01.533
{\an1}and threaten people
with violence.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.168
{\an6}No.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.168
Who are just fans.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.070
{\an1}Fans don't wanna get
on their knees and figure out

15:05.137 --> 15:07.406
{\an1}what's behind your boxers--
those are called Beckys.

15:07.473 --> 15:09.742
If your ass is on your knees

15:09.808 --> 15:12.478
and you have no business being
on your knees with a married man

15:12.544 --> 15:14.213
or with a man
in a relationship,

15:14.280 --> 15:16.649
you are a Becky,
and you a thirsty Becky.

15:16.715 --> 15:17.983
Go get your own man.

15:18.050 --> 15:21.153
Females are trifling.
They want what I have.

15:21.220 --> 15:22.755
{\an1}You just gotta trust me,
though.

15:22.821 --> 15:26.058
'Cause we come a long way
from hiding in the trunk.

15:26.125 --> 15:28.661
I was not in the trunk
for no reason.

15:28.727 --> 15:30.162
Don't just say that to me.

15:30.229 --> 15:31.964
Why was I in the trunk,
babe?

15:32.031 --> 15:35.467
{\an1}What I was saying was,
we've come a long way from that.

15:35.534 --> 15:36.735
{\an6}True.

15:35.534 --> 15:36.735
And we're not there anymore,

15:36.802 --> 15:39.038
{\an5}so you can trust me.

15:36.802 --> 15:39.038
Don't be in a hotel

15:39.104 --> 15:41.573
{\an5}with no girls you
ain't supposed to be
in a damn hotel...

15:41.640 --> 15:44.310
{\an5}Ain't gonna be no hotels.

15:41.640 --> 15:44.310
...and I won't have to be
hiding in the damn trunk.

15:44.376 --> 15:46.612
Brandi done some
crazy (bleep) before.

15:46.679 --> 15:50.049
She done bugged my car,
hacked my phone,

15:50.115 --> 15:51.684
staked out in my trunk.

15:51.750 --> 15:52.885
She even broke in the studio

15:52.951 --> 15:55.054
as a pizza delivery person
one time.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.322
Here's the thing.

15:56.388 --> 15:58.590
A couple years back,
there was cheating.

15:58.657 --> 16:01.260
But since then,
I changed my whole act

16:01.327 --> 16:04.196
and I'm a model citizen
and a great husband.

16:04.263 --> 16:05.831
But she won't believe it.

16:05.898 --> 16:07.433
{\an1}We ain't gonna have
no situations?

16:07.499 --> 16:09.234
No, we're not.

16:09.301 --> 16:11.170
But you're
missing something.

16:11.236 --> 16:12.638
{\an1}What?

16:12.705 --> 16:13.639
{\an3}Your ring.

16:13.706 --> 16:16.008
{\an1}Oh, yeah,
I got my ring, too.

16:16.075 --> 16:18.344
{\an5}Baby... see?

16:16.075 --> 16:18.344
But, see-- well,

16:18.410 --> 16:19.912
how does it end up
in your pocket? Why--

16:19.978 --> 16:22.247
{\an1}Because it's special,
so I keep it close to my heart.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.283
{\an6}I love you.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.283
I love you more.

16:24.350 --> 16:25.417
You love me more?

16:25.484 --> 16:26.752
So that means you're
gonna be calling me

16:26.819 --> 16:28.620
to show me how much
you love me more.

16:28.687 --> 16:29.788
Right?

16:31.056 --> 16:32.191
Right?

16:33.492 --> 16:34.727
Right?

16:40.165 --> 16:42.401
{\an8}The (bleep) that went down
at the park the other day

16:42.468 --> 16:44.603
{\an8}with this Satan thot
is beyond crazy,

16:44.670 --> 16:47.106
{\an8}and now I need to regroup
with my girls and figure out

16:47.172 --> 16:49.541
{\an8}what just happened and what
I'm gonna do about it.

16:50.642 --> 16:52.644
{\an6}Hey, baby.

16:50.642 --> 16:52.644
{\an1}Hi!

16:52.711 --> 16:54.613
Hi. Mwah!

16:54.680 --> 16:56.715
Hi. Hi, boo.

16:56.782 --> 16:58.817
One of my oldest friends,
Shanda, is from Chicago,

16:58.884 --> 17:00.252
and she's new in town,

17:00.319 --> 17:02.488
{\an8}so I decided that I'd take her
to a boot camp class

17:02.554 --> 17:04.656
{\an8}in hoping that she can
meet some of my friends,

17:04.723 --> 17:06.858
but obviously,
that went wrong.

17:06.925 --> 17:08.493
{\an1}That (bleep)
was (bleep) crazy.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.028
{\an1}With what happened
at the park?

17:10.095 --> 17:11.730
{\an6}Too much.

17:10.095 --> 17:11.730
Who is this bitch?

17:11.797 --> 17:14.465
We used to live
in Atlanta, whatever.

17:14.532 --> 17:16.568
I was already with Dre.

17:16.635 --> 17:18.170
So you brought her
around your man.

17:18.237 --> 17:19.771
I brought her
around my man,

17:19.838 --> 17:24.376
but at the end of the day,
it's not about me.

17:24.443 --> 17:25.810
It's not even about him.

17:25.877 --> 17:29.048
It's about her,
wanting to be famous.

17:29.114 --> 17:30.449
{\an1}Yeah, but you're--
We're living--

17:30.516 --> 17:32.751
we living a lifestyle,
though, Nia, honestly,

17:32.818 --> 17:34.386
{\an1}and all of us do, that
where it's almost, like...

17:34.453 --> 17:36.121
{\an5}I know, I know.

17:34.453 --> 17:36.121
You know, we entertainers.

17:36.188 --> 17:37.423
{\an1}You know
what I'm saying?

17:37.489 --> 17:38.624
{\an8}I don't think she would
have (bleep) with him

17:38.690 --> 17:39.958
{\an8}if it wasn't Dre.

17:38.690 --> 17:39.958
{\an8}What I'm saying is...

17:40.025 --> 17:41.827
So what I'm saying
is it almost like,

17:41.894 --> 17:43.462
{\an1}it almost, like,
comes with the territory.

17:43.529 --> 17:45.764
{\an3}Some people honor the fact that
they're side bitches, though.

17:45.831 --> 17:46.765
You gotta understand that.

17:46.832 --> 17:48.066
But you're
not even that.

17:48.133 --> 17:49.768
They okay with being
side bitches nowadays.

17:49.835 --> 17:52.237
{\an1}I can't even give you that.
You can't even have that.

17:52.304 --> 17:53.672
{\an1}Well, shut it down,
then.

17:53.739 --> 17:57.042
Bitches get (bleep), like,
and that's all you were.

17:57.109 --> 18:00.045
{\an1}So have you talked to Dre?
Has, like...

18:00.112 --> 18:02.047
{\an1}Me and Dre are cool,
'cause at the end of the day,

18:02.114 --> 18:04.883
{\an1}whatever she says, whatever
she thinks going on,

18:04.950 --> 18:07.386
she's delusional,
and at the end of the day,

18:07.453 --> 18:08.687
it's me and him.

18:08.754 --> 18:10.489
Nas may have messed
with Dre in the past,

18:10.556 --> 18:12.825
but she'll never be a permanent
part of his life,

18:12.891 --> 18:14.393
and there's
no way I'm letting this

18:14.460 --> 18:16.061
Bozo the Clown-looking bitch

18:16.128 --> 18:18.230
get in between
what we have going on.

18:18.297 --> 18:20.065
I'll have another
conversation with her.

18:20.132 --> 18:25.170
{\an1}To tell her how delusional
she is, but I will say this.

18:25.237 --> 18:27.272
You try me, you try my life,

18:27.339 --> 18:30.142
you try my happiness,
because I'm happy...

18:30.209 --> 18:32.110
you're trying my happiness,

18:32.177 --> 18:35.247
I'm gonna (bleep) you up.

18:38.183 --> 18:40.819
{\an7}I had a conversation with Miles
and I'm, like, you know what?

18:40.886 --> 18:43.188
{\an7}Now you all of a sudden
have all these reservations.

18:43.255 --> 18:44.556
{\an7}And where is that
coming from?

18:44.623 --> 18:46.358
{\an8}I feel like
he might be cheating.

18:46.425 --> 18:47.926
{\an8}We were building something.

18:47.993 --> 18:49.695
{\an8}Maybe I did want you.

18:47.993 --> 18:49.695
{\an9}Okay.

18:49.761 --> 18:51.463
{\an8}And then once I started
to experience and taste

18:51.530 --> 18:53.932
{\an7}a little more,
maybe I didn't want it.

18:53.999 --> 18:56.702
{\an8}Nobody wants you,
you dirty ho!

18:56.768 --> 18:58.470
{\an8}But I'm still (bleep)
your (bleep), though.

18:58.537 --> 19:01.006
{\an8}Go fix your teeth
and that rotten (bleep).

19:01.073 --> 19:02.407
{\an8}You stupid-ass bitch.

19:08.213 --> 19:10.983
♪♪

19:13.585 --> 19:16.288
Between me revisiting
my drama with T.T.

19:16.355 --> 19:18.257
and Milan and all
his boy troubles,

19:18.323 --> 19:20.526
we both could use a little bit
of retail therapy.

19:20.592 --> 19:22.027
That always helps.

19:22.094 --> 19:23.629
Ah... it's too late.

19:23.695 --> 19:25.264
No, it looks good
with your outfit.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.733
After Milan told me about
his issues with Miles,

19:27.799 --> 19:30.936
I definitely want to sip some
tea to find out that scoop.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.038
I mean, I got
my own dirt to dish,

19:33.105 --> 19:34.840
but it is nice to know
I'm not the only one

19:34.907 --> 19:36.942
with drama in these streets.

19:38.076 --> 19:39.611
That was cool.

19:39.678 --> 19:41.246
{\an5}Got some cute stuff.

19:39.678 --> 19:41.246
{\an3}Yeah.

19:41.313 --> 19:46.351
So first of all, um...
I met up with Teairra.

19:46.418 --> 19:47.986
Really?
What happened with that?

19:48.053 --> 19:49.855
She apologized.
She apologized.

19:49.922 --> 19:51.356
Okay.
Oh, so she admitted it?

19:51.423 --> 19:53.759
{\an7}Hold on. She didn't admit
that she actually,

19:53.825 --> 19:56.662
{\an7}you know, uh,
slobbed on his (bleep).

19:56.728 --> 19:58.330
{\an6}Right.

19:56.728 --> 19:58.330
But... she did admit

19:58.397 --> 20:02.234
{\an1}that the relationship
that she had in general,

20:02.301 --> 20:04.469
{\an1}was inappropriate,
which to me, honestly,

20:04.536 --> 20:05.904
{\an1}that's a big step
for Teairra,

20:05.971 --> 20:07.673
{\an1}'cause she don't like to own up
to nothing that she does.

20:07.739 --> 20:09.741
{\an8}But at the end of the day,
you're my friend,

20:09.808 --> 20:11.743
{\an8}and I feel like she's hurt you
enough, you know what I mean?

20:11.810 --> 20:13.845
{\an1}I mean, it's like, it's that
thing, like, fool me once,

20:13.912 --> 20:15.647
{\an1}shame on you,
fool me twice, shame on me.

20:15.714 --> 20:17.115
{\an1}You know what I'm saying?
So it's just like...

20:17.182 --> 20:19.651
{\an1}Okay, but this is like,
shame on your ass 20 times.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.853
{\an1}Well, honey, I'm sorry,
I have a forgiving heart,

20:21.920 --> 20:23.722
{\an1}and nobody will understand
the relationship

20:23.789 --> 20:26.892
{\an1}with me and Teairra, but we'll
see if we can get past him.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.560
I ain't tripping
on that, honey.

20:28.627 --> 20:30.195
{\an1}But what I do want
to know is,

20:30.262 --> 20:32.831
{\an1}did you have that
conversation with Miles?

20:32.898 --> 20:34.833
(groans)
Oh, my God, so...

20:34.900 --> 20:36.868
{\an1}Honey, let me sit down.
'Cause, wait.

20:36.935 --> 20:39.137
{\an1}I don't know if these Loubs
are made for this conversation.

20:39.204 --> 20:40.505
{\an3}Oh, God.

20:40.572 --> 20:43.141
So I had a conversation
with Miles and I'm like,

20:43.208 --> 20:45.043
"You know what? I don't
want to be your secret.

20:45.110 --> 20:47.179
Like, how long are we
gonna go through this?"

20:47.245 --> 20:48.347
You know what I mean?
It's not--

20:48.413 --> 20:49.915
It's not a fly-by-night
situation.

20:49.982 --> 20:55.253
{\an1}Is it more so that he's not
ready to come out to the world

20:55.320 --> 20:58.423
{\an1}about being gay or is it
more about the commitment?

20:58.490 --> 21:00.292
I'm trying to figure out--
like, I can understand

21:00.359 --> 21:04.062
{\an1}if he has his reservations
about coming out to the world.

21:04.129 --> 21:06.431
{\an4}Right.

21:04.129 --> 21:06.431
You know, being gay.

21:06.498 --> 21:07.933
{\an5}Exactly, like, that's--

21:06.498 --> 21:07.933
Like, I--
I get that, anybody--

21:08.000 --> 21:09.201
I've went through that,
you know what I mean?

21:09.267 --> 21:11.069
{\an1}I brought you to the Grammys
and everything else,

21:11.136 --> 21:12.504
{\an5}trying to pretend.

21:11.136 --> 21:12.504
Being the beard.

21:12.571 --> 21:13.805
You know what I mean?

21:13.872 --> 21:15.140
Before I first came out,
I used to go

21:15.207 --> 21:16.575
to the straight clubs
and bring Hazel along

21:16.642 --> 21:18.110
so she could pretend
she was my girlfriend.

21:18.176 --> 21:20.579
I used to hate
not being able to just be me.

21:20.646 --> 21:21.847
At one point, I just woke up
and was like,

21:21.913 --> 21:22.881
I don't really
give a (bleep).

21:22.948 --> 21:24.216
Like, I just want to be me,

21:24.282 --> 21:25.617
and if people can't
accept me for me,

21:25.684 --> 21:27.019
then I don't really care.

21:27.085 --> 21:29.421
{\an1}He might not be in the same
space that I am in,

21:29.488 --> 21:31.890
but it's more so the fact
that now all of a sudden,

21:31.957 --> 21:35.627
{\an1}when it's getting closer
to time where I'm really ready

21:35.694 --> 21:37.462
to move forward,
now you all of a sudden

21:37.529 --> 21:39.031
have all these reservations.

21:39.097 --> 21:40.599
{\an1}And where is that
coming from? Like...

21:40.666 --> 21:42.034
And that's what
I want to know.

21:42.100 --> 21:43.735
Like, I don't know if it's
the fact that he's still

21:43.802 --> 21:46.738
going through this mental thing
about coming out to the world,

21:46.805 --> 21:48.306
or if it's somebody else.

21:48.373 --> 21:50.275
Like, I don't know.
Like--

21:50.342 --> 21:51.843
Somebody else?

21:51.910 --> 21:53.412
I feel like
he might be cheating.

21:53.478 --> 21:55.113
It would crush me
if Miles was cheating.

21:55.180 --> 21:56.548
And I really hope
that I'm wrong,

21:56.615 --> 21:58.216
but even if Miles
is not cheating on me,

21:58.283 --> 22:00.852
I need him to come out,
be the man that I need him to be

22:00.919 --> 22:02.387
and move forward
our relationship.

22:02.454 --> 22:04.523
If he's not gonna do that,
then I'm out.

22:04.589 --> 22:06.058
{\an1}I mean, so where do you
go from here?

22:06.124 --> 22:07.659
{\an1}I don't know, I'm gonna have
to go through that phone,

22:07.726 --> 22:09.061
gonna have to do
some detective work.

22:09.127 --> 22:10.429
{\an1}We're gonna have to
figure something out, so...

22:10.495 --> 22:11.963
{\an1}Well, you know when you
go looking for something,

22:12.030 --> 22:13.498
then you gonna find it.

Yo, what the (bleep)?

22:22.374 --> 22:24.876
I left Kamiah my key
and I come back home

22:24.943 --> 22:26.945
to a completely different crib
than the one I left.

22:27.012 --> 22:30.749
{\an8}I offered her two drawers
to leave some things in.

22:30.816 --> 22:34.586
{\an8}And when I get back, it's like
she moved her whole crib in.

22:34.653 --> 22:38.757
She moved my furniture around,
she took over half my closet.

22:38.824 --> 22:41.193
(bleep), she even brought in
her feminine products

22:41.259 --> 22:43.261

I decided I'm not gonna wait to

Absolutely not, I didn't.

23:44.189 --> 23:45.590
{\an4}Why, Nia?

23:44.189 --> 23:45.590
Let me say this,

'cause I think you forget

No, no, no, no...

{\an1}Oh, do I? And you (bleep)
my (bleep) plus yours,

Yes, I got with Dre after Nia
and him broke up the first time,

24:10.615 --> 24:13.351

that it was two years later,

{\an8}after she destroyed our
friendship by (bleep) not one,

But even though Dre and I
fight sometimes,

24:20.692 --> 24:22.093
he always comes back to me.

24:22.160 --> 24:23.895
{\an1}I had a relationship
with Dre.

24:23.962 --> 24:26.298
{\an1}So you thought he took you
seriously, that's what it was.

24:26.364 --> 24:27.899
{\an1}Oh, did I think?
Or, no, did I know?

24:27.966 --> 24:29.801
{\an1}'Cause I was living with him,
sweetheart.

24:29.868 --> 24:31.102
Right now, we're together.

24:31.169 --> 24:34.072
So, baby, let it go.

Everything that she's

wants to be where I am,

24:59.497 --> 25:00.765

{\an1}No, this is--
Why do you have his ring?

Does that fit my finger?
Let's see.

{\an1}I don't know.
A baby finger? No.

27:23.541 --> 27:24.909

27:30.315 --> 27:33.118
Oh, look, I see--
Oh, it's Daddy's ring.

27:33.184 --> 27:34.452

{\an1}Daddy's going to the studio,
no ring, bitches around.

27:37.055 --> 27:38.490
Mmm, of course.

27:38.556 --> 27:39.591
And it pisses me off.

27:39.657 --> 27:41.459
Then I'm sitting here
saying,

27:41.526 --> 27:43.828
"This has happened
two or three times."

{\an1}What, he's taken
his ring off?

27:45.597 --> 27:47.532
Right, so when you
don't have it on,

27:47.599 --> 27:49.534
that's more of an excuse
for these females

27:49.601 --> 27:51.302
that sitting
in the studio, groupies.

sausage, chicken?"

I've been trying to keep the old
cray-cray Brandi locked up,

the house without his ring on.

28:15.927 --> 28:20.598
If there is something going on,
I must find out.

28:20.665 --> 28:22.867
I mean, in your opinion,
am I tripping or...

28:22.934 --> 28:24.335
No, I don't think you're
tripping, to be honest.

28:24.402 --> 28:25.637

{\an3}Nothing.

35:58.789 --> 36:01.092
Just figuring out--
kind of out of place,

36:01.158 --> 36:03.127
where I'm, like, wanting
to know, what is it?

36:03.194 --> 36:04.562
I don't know if you, like,

36:04.629 --> 36:06.831
fully understood what I was
saying, like, with dating,

36:06.898 --> 36:09.967
{\an1}but I'm still, like,
kinda playing the field.

36:10.034 --> 36:11.369
We were
building something.

36:11.435 --> 36:12.970
Now, if you were painting
a picture of something

36:13.037 --> 36:15.239
that wasn't really
what you wanted,

36:15.306 --> 36:16.507
then that's
different, but...

36:16.574 --> 36:17.842
{\an5}Maybe I did want you.

36:16.574 --> 36:17.842
{\an3}Okay.

36:17.909 --> 36:19.810
{\an1}And then once I started to
experience and taste

36:19.877 --> 36:21.479
{\an1}a little more,
maybe I didn't want it.

36:21.546 --> 36:22.780
That could have been
communicated before,

36:22.847 --> 36:23.915
like, over
the last couple months.

36:23.981 --> 36:24.982
Yeah, but you cute, so...

36:25.049 --> 36:26.551
But I'm cute.
So what?

36:26.617 --> 36:27.885
(chuckling)

36:27.952 --> 36:29.654
{\an1}It's like, you--
you ever been to a restaurant,

36:29.720 --> 36:31.956
{\an1}and you get those, like...
that one appetizer you like,

36:32.023 --> 36:34.559
and then you got, like, a main
course that you stick to, too?

36:34.625 --> 36:36.327
{\an1}You referring to me as the
appetizer or the main course?

36:36.394 --> 36:38.029
{\an1}No, I'm saying I'm not ready
for my main course,

36:38.095 --> 36:40.898
{\an4}and I'm having appetizers
right now, I'm sampling.
You know?

36:40.965 --> 36:43.301
{\an8}Obviously, we're on two
completely different pages

36:43.367 --> 36:44.869
{\an8}as to what we have going on.

36:44.936 --> 36:46.904
{\an8}I'm sitting here thinking
to myself, "How is this?"

36:46.971 --> 36:49.206
{\an8}I'm definitely
not dating myself.

36:49.273 --> 36:51.208
I didn't give myself
a key to your house,

36:51.275 --> 36:53.778
and I definitely didn't
introduce myself to your son.

36:53.844 --> 36:55.413
So he's tripping,
but that's fine,

36:55.479 --> 36:57.782
'cause he take that elsewhere
and find someone else

36:57.848 --> 37:00.585
who wants to be an appetizer
and can deal with all of that.

37:00.651 --> 37:02.153
Like, it's all a bunch
of bull(bleep) to me.

37:02.219 --> 37:04.689
And if that's how you feel,
I'm sorry you feel that way,

37:04.755 --> 37:06.657
{\an1}but I have to move
at my pace.

37:06.724 --> 37:08.426
{\an5}That's just what I realized.

37:06.724 --> 37:08.426
{\an3}Okay.

37:08.492 --> 37:09.560
And I wasn't moving
at my own pace.

37:09.627 --> 37:11.195
We were moving
at the same pace.

37:11.262 --> 37:12.263
{\an5}No, you were moving--

37:11.262 --> 37:12.263
Don't paint me out
to be delusional.

37:12.330 --> 37:13.431
{\an1}No, you were moving
at the pace,

37:13.497 --> 37:15.433
'cause I told you,
"Come stay with me,

37:15.499 --> 37:18.035
{\an4}here go a couple drawers,"
and you moved your
whole place in.

37:18.102 --> 37:21.038
First of all, I didn't move
my whole place in, at all.

37:21.105 --> 37:23.107
{\an5}Okay, well, it was enough.

37:21.105 --> 37:23.107
You're being dramatic.

37:23.174 --> 37:24.175
You're being disrespectful
about it, is my thing.

37:24.241 --> 37:25.543
{\an5}I'm not being disrespectful.

37:24.241 --> 37:25.543

{\an1}You're being full of (bleep)
is what you're being, but okay.

37:29.213 --> 37:33.551
{\an4}So if you want to sit here
and date me while I'm dating
around, then that's up to you.

37:33.618 --> 37:34.885
And I'm making
the decision not to.

37:34.952 --> 37:36.253
{\an5}Okay, so then we're not...

37:34.952 --> 37:36.253
I'm not gonna do that.

37:36.320 --> 37:37.388
I'm not gonna
sit around while you

37:37.455 --> 37:38.623

appetizers.

37:38.689 --> 37:40.391
Because we're not
in the same space.

37:40.458 --> 37:41.926
So we're making the decision
just to go our separate ways.

37:41.993 --> 37:43.461
{\an5}That's fine,
we can do that.

37:41.993 --> 37:43.461
I'm fine with that, too.

37:43.527 --> 37:45.429
