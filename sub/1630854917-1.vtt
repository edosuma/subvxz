01:26.920 --> 01:30.920
Help me, please!
Help me! Help me!

01:33.920 --> 01:37.920
No! No! No!

01:58.480 --> 02:01.160
Put her down, put her down.

02:12.840 --> 02:14.960
Don't just sit there!
Go get me the towel.

03:17.600 --> 03:20.760
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

03:20.760 --> 03:25.360
God Almighty. Our God who rules
the heavens and the earth.

03:25.360 --> 03:27.720
Our God in the flesh and in spirit.

03:27.720 --> 03:30.880
Our God who holds our ancestors
in His hands.

03:30.880 --> 03:34.280
The God of our ancestors
who rest at your feet.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.640
I call on all our ancestors.

04:11.840 --> 04:17.480
I call on you
all my elders, my ancestors.

04:17.480 --> 04:21.600
I call on you all to gather.
They have come to plead with you.

04:21.600 --> 04:27.800
They have come to you humbly,
with open hearts and open hands.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.320
They have come to plead.

04:29.320 --> 04:37.120
By the spirit of Mbonisi Lazarus
Majola who died here tragically.

06:04.600 --> 06:08.600
- ♪ Title: Lizalis'idinga Lakho ♪

06:52.360 --> 06:55.240
-  I think we did well.
-  Mmm.

06:56.160 --> 06:59.080
- Yes, everything went as it should.
- Everything went well.

07:18.760 --> 07:21.080
-  Hi, Lindiwe.
- Hi.

07:21.080 --> 07:25.000
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Lazarus seemed like a wonderful man.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.720
Mbonisi.

07:28.480 --> 07:30.880
Well, today we were celebrating
his life.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.080
Okay.

07:35.080 --> 07:38.360
Hey, Sienna. Any news on Yola?

07:38.360 --> 07:40.760
She, uh...

07:41.800 --> 07:43.800
Can we-- Can we talk?

07:43.800 --> 07:45.480
Yeah, sure.

07:45.480 --> 07:47.800
- Just a minute, Ma.
-  Mm-hm.

07:50.160 --> 07:52.160
Have you heard anything?

07:52.920 --> 07:54.960
No.

07:54.960 --> 07:58.040
Well, Dirk thinks she may have been abducted.

07:58.040 --> 07:59.800
- Abducted?
-  Ja.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.800
- By who?
-  I don't know.

08:01.800 --> 08:04.000
He's clutching at straws.

08:08.280 --> 08:11.880
Do you think maybe, just...
just things...

08:13.480 --> 08:16.600
just, like,
things just got too much for her?

08:17.960 --> 08:20.360
What do you mean?
As in, she killed herself?

08:21.080 --> 08:22.600
Maybe.

08:22.600 --> 08:25.000
But they're still looking for her, right?

08:25.000 --> 08:27.680
They're dredging the dam,
as we speak.

08:27.680 --> 08:29.800
Jesus, Sienna.

08:31.720 --> 08:34.200
No.
Everything will be okay.

08:35.440 --> 08:37.760
- She's still alive.
-  Mm.

08:37.760 --> 08:39.760
I can feel it.

08:44.360 --> 08:47.280
She'll be fine. She'll be fine.

08:47.280 --> 08:50.360
- It's gonna be okay.

08:50.360 --> 08:52.760
It's gonna be okay.

08:56.080 --> 08:58.760
How's your court case?

08:58.760 --> 09:02.720
I might get two years.
It doesn't help that I was speeding,

09:02.720 --> 09:04.720
or that my lawyer's not on solid
foods yet.

09:04.720 --> 09:07.720
- So...

09:08.440 --> 09:10.360
Oh, I'm...

09:10.360 --> 09:13.160
I came here to tell you
I'm not gonna contest your claim.

09:14.080 --> 09:17.040
The land. I wanna give it to you.

09:17.800 --> 09:20.640
Oh wow, Sienna. Really?

09:23.560 --> 09:25.960
Ja. It was his all along.

09:26.960 --> 09:30.560
Now it's yours.

09:31.040 --> 09:32.640
Thank you.

09:33.360 --> 09:36.600
Just... let me know when you hear anything.

09:37.080 --> 09:38.640
Yeah, I will.

09:41.720 --> 09:44.760
Sorry, um... I need to--
I need to take this.

09:46.680 --> 09:49.280
Dirk?

09:50.120 --> 09:52.040
You found what?

09:52.040 --> 09:54.880
Oh God. Okay.
I'm coming. I'm coming.

09:55.720 --> 09:58.400
-  Shit.

10:27.080 --> 10:29.320
Describe your hallucination.

10:29.320 --> 10:31.600
I wasn't hallucinating.

10:32.080 --> 10:34.280
Describe her to me.

10:36.440 --> 10:38.360
A girl.

10:38.360 --> 10:43.080
She was bleeding from her eyes,
from her ears, from her nose.

10:44.920 --> 10:46.920
That's very graphic.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.400
Describe the room.

10:49.880 --> 10:52.120
A red basement.

10:52.120 --> 10:53.920
Red?

10:53.920 --> 10:55.720
Interesting.

10:58.320 --> 11:01.480
- Where is she?
-  Where she's always been.

11:01.480 --> 11:03.240
In your mind.

11:04.120 --> 11:07.080
I find it interesting that
she bleeds from all orpheuses

11:07.080 --> 11:10.480
and that light is red. Hell-like.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.800
- I saw her.
-  I don't doubt it.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.640
For you, she's real.

11:22.240 --> 11:25.480
You suffer from
dissociative identity disorder.

11:26.040 --> 11:29.160
You call her up in moments
of distress.

11:29.160 --> 11:33.640
Another identity to help you cope
with feelings you can't manage.

11:33.640 --> 11:37.240
Repressive feelings like hate
and rage.

11:38.400 --> 11:40.800
I think we might have to look
at changing your medication.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.880
Oh.

11:44.880 --> 11:46.640
I'm not the liar.

11:46.640 --> 11:49.720
On the contrary,
that's exactly what you are.

11:49.720 --> 11:54.520
- You've made no progress. Zero.

11:55.200 --> 12:00.200
From your very first day here,
accusing innocent people of rape.

12:02.800 --> 12:05.800
I mean, look at you.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.880
Who in their right mind...

12:10.320 --> 12:13.000
would want to rape that?

12:19.800 --> 12:22.800
- What are you going to do?

12:23.320 --> 12:26.840
- What are you doing?!

12:46.440 --> 12:49.560
Remind me why she wasn't
our first test subject.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.680
- Her brother.
- Oh, yes.

12:51.680 --> 12:54.400
That neurotic pain in the ass.

12:54.400 --> 12:57.280
Get him in here. I'm bored with her.

13:43.480 --> 13:45.320
Sienna!

13:53.880 --> 13:55.720
I tried to tell you.

13:58.480 --> 14:00.400
Don't.

14:01.120 --> 14:02.920
Just trying to help.

14:05.240 --> 14:07.360
Just find her, Dirk.

14:07.360 --> 14:09.360
That would help.

14:17.800 --> 14:20.200
I'm happy you're back, Themba.

14:20.720 --> 14:23.280
After the abduction of her spirit,
she just hasn't been the person

14:23.280 --> 14:25.000
that we know her as.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.200
What's the matter?

14:27.560 --> 14:29.800
It's like half of her is here with us

14:29.800 --> 14:33.040
and the other half is with Simphiwe
and Mbonisi.

14:33.040 --> 14:36.880
She talks about them as if they are
still alive.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.840
Is she eating?

14:40.240 --> 14:41.960
Barely.

14:46.400 --> 14:48.080
How can I help?

14:49.160 --> 14:51.480
Help bring her back, Themba.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.880
It's like she can't see that her life
is important.

14:55.880 --> 14:59.440
Yes, those who've passed
are important but...

14:59.440 --> 15:02.200
she must also fight for her life.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.280
I will try.

15:27.040 --> 15:29.000
Move this, Max.

15:29.440 --> 15:31.320
Move that, Max.

15:35.400 --> 15:38.000
Ja, Rudy. Sure, Rudy.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Whatever you say.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.680
When you love someone,

16:49.680 --> 16:52.880
you can be woken up at any time,
and talk about them.

16:52.880 --> 16:56.800
You don't even need a script
when it comes to Mbonisi.

16:56.800 --> 17:02.600
We would laugh and smile just
thinking about all his antics.

17:02.600 --> 17:06.600
- As old as I am...

17:06.600 --> 17:11.520
...makes me go back to a time
when I was growing up with Mbonisi.

17:11.520 --> 17:14.960
Some of the other things he did.

17:15.640 --> 17:18.240
There is so much more that can be said.

17:18.240 --> 17:21.120
- Remember when we grew up...
- Excuse me, Tata.

17:21.120 --> 17:24.040
- Alright, all good Nephew.
- Thank you.

20:34.160 --> 20:37.760
- Yola!

20:54.280 --> 20:57.360
Welcome to you all
on this wonderful day.

20:57.360 --> 21:01.960
The first of a week of celebrating
the breaking of the drought!

21:01.960 --> 21:04.640
-  Hey?

21:04.640 --> 21:10.800
Culminating in the daughters of
Jacob debutante dance on Sunday.

21:10.800 --> 21:14.000
- Yeah.
- Woo-hoo!

21:14.560 --> 21:20.480
Please join me in a moment of silence
for our late leader, Jacob Fischer,

21:20.480 --> 21:25.280
our guiding light and the man
that taught me everything I know.

21:25.280 --> 21:27.240
Please.

21:32.080 --> 21:34.400
Thank you. Now, eat, drink.

21:34.400 --> 21:37.120
Enjoy yourselves.
This is a celebration.

21:57.440 --> 21:59.440
Just give her a minute.

22:04.960 --> 22:07.480
Hey. How are you holding up?

22:07.480 --> 22:09.160
Oh. Ready to party?

22:09.160 --> 22:11.520
Don't worry.
She'll turn up.

22:11.520 --> 22:13.560
Hm. Maybe one of your shiny,
happy swimmers

22:13.560 --> 22:15.920
are gonna find her in the dam.

22:15.920 --> 22:18.600
Did you have a chance to look
at the papers again last night?

22:20.440 --> 22:22.040
-  Mm-hm.
-  And?

22:22.040 --> 22:24.160
- I'm not gonna sign them.
-  Why not?

22:24.160 --> 22:25.800
Well, it's not mine to sell.

22:25.800 --> 22:29.720
- You said you have power of attorney.
- I do. Until Yola is back.

22:29.720 --> 22:32.040
But I'm giving it back
to its rightful owners.

22:32.040 --> 22:34.080
Sienna, please.
I need you to sign.

22:34.080 --> 22:36.800
Wow, Rudy. Thank you for your
support during these tough times,

22:36.800 --> 22:39.000
- really means a lot.
-  Come on, Sienna.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.640
You want the land? Speak to Themba.

23:14.080 --> 23:16.120
Can I join you?

23:26.400 --> 23:28.600
They're having fun.

23:32.600 --> 23:34.600
I know it's hard.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.400
First your father
and now your sister?

23:39.400 --> 23:41.800
No, you don't know.

23:44.360 --> 23:46.360
I do.

23:46.920 --> 23:48.920
I just...

23:49.520 --> 23:52.520
I don't understand it.
We were sitting right here

23:52.520 --> 23:54.920
in this exact spot.

23:57.560 --> 23:59.760
She was so strong.

24:01.880 --> 24:04.280
I've never seen her like that.

24:06.280 --> 24:08.520
And now she's just gone.
It doesn't make...

24:08.520 --> 24:11.120
Doesn't make any sense.

24:18.240 --> 24:20.240
Don't be sad.

24:21.920 --> 24:23.520
Okay?

24:25.400 --> 24:28.400
I'd swop places with her if I could.

24:36.160 --> 24:38.200
Where're you going?

24:38.200 --> 24:41.280
Home. I don't wanna be here.

24:41.280 --> 24:44.280
-  I'll come by later.
-  No, don't.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.600
I wanna be alone.

25:11.680 --> 25:14.560
I'm gonna get another beer.
Excuse me.

25:27.320 --> 25:30.040
...stop. Don't.

25:30.040 --> 25:32.720
Oh God. Stop! Stop!

25:32.720 --> 25:35.040
No! Stop! No.

25:35.040 --> 25:37.640
My brother is such an idiot.

25:39.400 --> 25:41.400
I think he thinks
she likes it.

25:41.400 --> 25:43.440
- She might.

25:50.120 --> 25:54.080
Mm. I see she's made a new friend.

25:58.720 --> 26:02.240
Rudy? We need to talk.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.560
- Well, and?
-  They're really good.

26:08.560 --> 26:13.120
Alluvial diamonds.
Great clarity, great colour.

26:13.120 --> 26:14.920
He found them in the river's bend.

26:14.920 --> 26:17.000
And he says there's a lot more
where they came from.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.040
- And what does he want in return?
-  Nothing.

26:19.040 --> 26:21.080
- I've sorted out his charges.

26:21.080 --> 26:23.480
I think he just wants a little taste.

26:25.160 --> 26:29.120
Hey, why the frown face?
It's a celebration.

26:29.120 --> 26:31.840
- She's not signing.
- She's got the power of attorney.

26:31.840 --> 26:35.400
Yes, she does. But it's not that...
She's giving it to Themba.

26:35.400 --> 26:37.960
-  Giving it to Themba?
- She feels guilty.

26:37.960 --> 26:41.360
Jesus Christ.
Guilt is such a useless emotion.

26:41.360 --> 26:43.280
Okay. You've got to make him
an offer.

26:43.280 --> 26:45.000
Get him to sign
before he finds out more.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.600
-  Finds out what?

26:47.600 --> 26:49.960
Hey? Finds out what?

26:51.960 --> 26:53.920
-  Okay, Rudy, we need to talk.
- Not now, Max.

26:53.920 --> 26:56.040
- No, no, no. Now.
- What is it?

26:56.040 --> 27:00.120
Um... I found skeletons.

27:00.120 --> 27:03.640
- What are you talking about?
- I was digging up the bend, New Road.

27:03.640 --> 27:04.920
- Like you instructed me...
- Yeah.

27:04.920 --> 27:06.720
for fuck knows why. Ja?

27:06.720 --> 27:10.720
I dug into the bank and
there was a waterfall of skeletons.

27:10.720 --> 27:12.960
- Whose fucking skeletons?
- How the fuck do I know?

27:12.960 --> 27:15.800
It's not like they had names on them.
But there's a lot, okay?

27:15.800 --> 27:18.200
And they're old. It's like a--
it's like a mass grave.

27:18.200 --> 27:20.880
- Jesus, only you Max.
- Ja, ja. Only me.

27:20.880 --> 27:23.920
Because it's only me who has to do
all the shitty jobs.

27:23.920 --> 27:26.920
-  Okay.
- Okay, okay. Look, um...

27:27.360 --> 27:28.960
What are we gonna do?

27:28.960 --> 27:32.600
I don't know. Just don't talk to
anyone else and get rid of them.

27:32.600 --> 27:35.880
Okay? Whoa, whoa.
Where are you going? Rudy?

27:35.880 --> 27:38.520
- What's going on?
- Just get rid of them.

28:20.480 --> 28:22.280
Over here!

28:55.800 --> 28:57.800
Help!

29:39.240 --> 29:41.120
How can we help you, sir?

29:41.120 --> 29:43.240
I'm here to speak to Themba.

29:43.240 --> 29:45.440
It'll be quick. I promise.

29:47.760 --> 29:49.760
Themba!

30:03.360 --> 30:05.640
Did you bring this clown?

30:08.440 --> 30:11.560
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- You look it.

30:11.560 --> 30:14.400
Yeah, well, it's out the dam.

30:14.400 --> 30:16.040
What do you want?

30:16.040 --> 30:19.960
I wanna buy the land, the bit around
Mamlambo's Bend and these houses.

30:19.960 --> 30:22.800
- Ah, that was quick.
- I don't have any time to waste.

30:22.800 --> 30:26.800
Well, this is not a good time.
It's not even mine yet.

30:26.800 --> 30:29.200
Well, that's just a formality.

30:30.680 --> 30:32.680
Why the sudden rush?

30:34.360 --> 30:37.840
The cave with the sun drawings.
It's gonna become a heritage site.

30:37.840 --> 30:41.880
And we're thinking about
building a resort there.

30:41.880 --> 30:43.920
Bring in some money
for the whole town.

30:43.920 --> 30:46.240
- A resort? By the caves?
-  Mm-hm.

30:46.240 --> 30:48.440
No, I don't think so.

30:51.200 --> 30:53.080
Look, obviously,
you will get a percentage,

30:53.080 --> 30:54.880
and I'll make it worth your while.

30:54.880 --> 30:57.280
You and your aunt
will never have to work again.

30:57.280 --> 31:00.120
I'm busy. I've got to go.

31:00.120 --> 31:02.440
Yeah, well, think about it.

31:02.440 --> 31:04.440
I have.

31:14.880 --> 31:18.120
Sienna, is everything alright?

31:18.120 --> 31:19.560
It's so good to see you. It's--

31:19.560 --> 31:21.360
- Dirk.
-  Yeah?

31:21.360 --> 31:23.360
Shut up and fuck me.

31:24.440 --> 31:26.800
Yeah. This one's on Rudy, yeah?

31:30.320 --> 31:33.320
-  Welcome back, stranger.

31:33.320 --> 31:35.960
- How's it, bro?
-  So you're out?

31:36.840 --> 31:39.480
That I am. That I am.

31:40.600 --> 31:45.560
Hey. I'm sorry to hear about your
grandfather. How was the ceremony?

31:45.560 --> 31:49.640
It was good to give him
a proper send-off.

31:49.640 --> 31:52.240
- I'm happy.
-  Yeah.

31:52.240 --> 31:54.400
Listen. Um...

31:55.240 --> 31:57.960
Do you know where I can buy
some proper weed here?

32:00.200 --> 32:03.480
I know just the place.
Best in the district.

32:03.480 --> 32:06.480
-  Great.
- Give me one second.

32:15.720 --> 32:17.320
I want you to release her.

32:17.320 --> 32:18.880
It's impossible.
She's not ready.

32:18.880 --> 32:20.880
Well, does she remember what happened
at the Spring Festival?

32:20.880 --> 32:22.480
- No.
- Well then, she's ready.

32:22.480 --> 32:23.640
No, we need more time.

32:23.640 --> 32:25.280
Well, you just said
she doesn't remember anything.

32:25.280 --> 32:27.680
It's the early stages of
an experimental process.

32:27.680 --> 32:30.840
Trial and error. We don't know
what remains. Holes, shadows--

32:30.840 --> 32:34.240
Look. This isn't a debate.
Let her go, tonight.

32:36.960 --> 32:39.520
Yoh!

32:39.520 --> 32:41.560
Bra, we have been walking.

32:41.560 --> 32:44.320
We're almost
there, man.

32:44.320 --> 32:46.680
You didn't say
we're gonna take a hike, though.

32:46.680 --> 32:48.680
Yeah, well.

32:52.440 --> 32:54.400
Oh.

33:21.440 --> 33:24.080
Welcome.

33:24.080 --> 33:28.520
- Ah, ah, ah, ah. Charlton?
-  Yeah.

33:28.520 --> 33:31.080
-  What a 'ting, dog.
-  Smell it.

33:31.080 --> 33:34.320
Ah. Ooh.

33:34.320 --> 33:36.760
It's still drying. Smell it.

33:36.760 --> 33:39.400
-  Got that orange.
- Yeah.

33:40.320 --> 33:42.240
- This is great. It's good.
- Ah, beautiful.

33:42.240 --> 33:45.960
What you want?
A joint, bone-chilling?

33:45.960 --> 33:47.680
Uh, you know what?

33:47.680 --> 33:49.880
Give me a bazooka of a joint,
my friend.

33:49.880 --> 33:50.920
-  Joint?
- Yeah.

33:50.920 --> 33:53.400
-  Good choice.
- Yes. Nothing too strong.

33:53.400 --> 33:56.760
Tough luck, man.

33:56.760 --> 33:59.160
Tough luck. This has too strong.

35:17.680 --> 35:22.160
He wants Mamlambo's Bend,
Sienna's giving me the deed.

35:22.160 --> 35:25.720
That's fantastic.
And then he wants to buy it from you?

35:25.720 --> 35:27.720
-  For a lot of money.
- That's brilliant.

35:27.720 --> 35:30.040
I think you should do it.

35:32.040 --> 35:35.360
- I don't trust him.
- Um, nah he's-- He's fine.

35:35.360 --> 35:38.320
He's been nothing but good to me.

35:38.320 --> 35:40.080
You know, him and the committee,
they covered...

35:40.080 --> 35:42.960
all my sister's medical costs.

35:42.960 --> 35:44.600
Are you telling me to sell the land?

35:44.600 --> 35:48.280
No, I'm just saying, like,
if it was me, I would...

35:48.280 --> 35:51.240
I would take the money
and I would get as far away

35:51.240 --> 35:54.400
from this little piece of shit hole
in the ground as I possibly can.

35:54.400 --> 35:57.520
No, man. Mm-mm.
My grandfather died for this land.

35:57.520 --> 36:00.960
- I'm not doing that.
- Okay. But, I mean--

36:00.960 --> 36:03.040
I mean, he's dead.

36:03.840 --> 36:07.640
And this is your chance to get
out of here, so you should take it.

36:13.680 --> 36:16.160
Are you still hung up on her?

36:16.160 --> 36:18.360
- Yola?
- Mm.

36:20.280 --> 36:24.680
You know, I...

36:24.680 --> 36:26.600
What do you think, that she's
gonna... she's going to come back

36:26.600 --> 36:30.240
and the two of you are just
gonna live happily ever after?

36:30.240 --> 36:32.600
Maybe.

36:32.600 --> 36:37.600
No. We-- We're fuckable.
We're not marriable.

36:39.720 --> 36:43.000
Look at you rooting for Rudy,
defending him and shit.

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
I'm just saying, you know,
he didn't-- He didn't have to pay

36:46.000 --> 36:48.520
my sister's bills, but he put
his money where his mouth is.

36:48.520 --> 36:50.880
No, man, he's playing you.
There's an angle here,

36:50.880 --> 36:52.960
you just don't see it
because you're naive.

36:52.960 --> 36:54.040
- I'm naive?
- You're naive.

36:54.040 --> 36:56.840
I'm naive, but you're the one who
thinks that this beautiful white girl

36:56.840 --> 36:59.840
with all this land is gonna have
your brown babies.

37:07.520 --> 37:10.920
Well, I'd better get going.

37:10.920 --> 37:13.080
Hey, I didn't...

37:13.080 --> 37:15.400
I was just-- I was just joking, man.
Don't--

37:15.400 --> 37:18.640
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It's fine. It's fine.

37:18.640 --> 37:21.240
I just want to go clear my head.

37:22.120 --> 37:23.800
-  Alright.
- Yeah.

37:23.800 --> 37:27.280
Wait, you should--
You should take...

37:27.280 --> 37:29.480
take this.
This is, like, super strong.

37:29.480 --> 37:31.800
Just check the resin on this thing.

37:34.160 --> 37:37.120
And I di--
I didn't mean any offence, man.

37:37.120 --> 37:39.120
None taken.

37:41.640 --> 37:45.040
- Sure I can't give you a ride?
-  It's okay.

37:45.040 --> 37:49.160
I'll... I'll find my way.

37:49.960 --> 37:51.960
Alright.

37:54.880 --> 37:56.800
Oh.

38:01.840 --> 38:03.880
Why don't you stay?

38:08.840 --> 38:10.840
Sienna?

38:18.160 --> 38:20.560
It was good seeing you.

38:34.240 --> 38:36.440
I'll see you.

38:42.080 --> 38:44.440
Yeah.

38:44.440 --> 38:47.840
- See you.

40:39.800 --> 40:42.000
Fuck this.

41:19.080 --> 41:21.680
Jesus. Don't you knock?

41:58.320 --> 42:00.320
Yola?
