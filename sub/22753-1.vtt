02:40.500 --> 02:43.411
I'll tell ya, glad you're here.
I didn't think you'd make it.

02:43.491 --> 02:45.356
Heard they're closing the highway tonight.

02:45.436 --> 02:48.682
Not yet. Fire's still 65 miles out.

02:48.762 --> 02:49.817
Yeah?

02:49.897 --> 02:52.152
Thanks. Cheers.

02:52.232 --> 02:54.500
You're sweating like a pig, Barrett.

02:57.270 --> 02:59.747
- What's the buy-in?
- Hundred bucks.

02:59.827 --> 03:01.629
What's the game?

03:01.709 --> 03:03.597
- Texas hold 'em.
- Guy's robbing me blind.

03:03.677 --> 03:07.568
So, what, it's just the three of us?
Where's Carl and everybody?

03:07.648 --> 03:11.205
Well, he's up at Fort Yukon.
He won't be back for a couple weeks and...

03:11.285 --> 03:13.607
Wade's got his boy tonight.
What the hell is his name...

03:13.687 --> 03:15.955
- Matthew.
- Matthew, yeah.

03:19.252 --> 03:22.262
- Hey, are you in or what?
- Duty calls.

03:31.104 --> 03:32.479
Hello?

03:32.559 --> 03:36.185
- Did I wake you?
- <i>No, I'm up.</i>

03:38.044 --> 03:40.067
How was your meeting?

03:40.147 --> 03:42.670
<i>Well, all that's left are the signatures.</i>

03:42.750 --> 03:45.418
- Good.
- Drive was a stretch.

03:46.352 --> 03:49.543
- <i>Where are you now?</i>
- Lou's.

03:49.623 --> 03:51.157
<i>Okay.</i>

03:51.858 --> 03:53.681
<i>I think I might go to bed.</i>

03:54.361 --> 03:55.817
'Night.

03:56.197 --> 03:57.764
'Night.

04:00.833 --> 04:04.892
All I'm saying is you have
to have options. That's all.

04:04.972 --> 04:07.194
Without options,
you're gonna end up finding...

04:07.274 --> 04:10.097
You young kids,
you're only out chasing a buck.

04:10.177 --> 04:13.033
You don't know the meaning
of the word principle.

04:13.113 --> 04:15.603
- A man's gotta have principles. Am I right?
- That's right.

04:15.683 --> 04:18.505
But think about how much money
you'd make selling this?

04:18.584 --> 04:21.317
OExcuse me if I'm mistaken, but...

04:21.398 --> 04:23.798
...people still need to eat and drink, yeah?

04:24.158 --> 04:27.114
Alright, but think about the competition?

04:27.194 --> 04:29.795
- You got... you got...
- Are we gonna finish this hand?

04:30.536 --> 04:35.222
Yeah, big corporations and chains,
franchises breathing down your neck.

04:35.322 --> 04:38.379
- Yeah.
- We've got to move with the times.

04:38.459 --> 04:41.582
Now, when we have a republican
in the White House...

04:41.662 --> 04:45.464
- ...come November, I'll tell you this...
- What the fuck are you talking about?

04:46.533 --> 04:49.290
We can only hope. And I'll drink to that.

04:49.370 --> 04:51.768
- Cheers.
- How do you live with yourself?

04:53.474 --> 04:56.331
This hand will never change, will it?

04:58.511 --> 05:00.562
Excuse me, we're closed.

05:03.249 --> 05:05.973
- Fucking kids. No respect for anyone.
- I got it.

05:06.053 --> 05:09.656
- No, no, no. Don't do anything, just...
- Lou, stop.

05:15.261 --> 05:18.396
- Maybe you didn't hear our friend...
- Can I have...

05:18.476 --> 05:20.304
...the early bird special?

05:20.834 --> 05:22.390
What?

05:22.770 --> 05:24.659
The early bird special?

05:25.039 --> 05:27.073
With a glass of water, please.

05:28.541 --> 05:31.765
You need to go right now.

05:32.245 --> 05:33.767
No.

05:33.847 --> 05:35.702
I can't.

05:37.447 --> 05:39.284
I'm hungry.

05:41.721 --> 05:44.745
Maybe you're not understanding
what I'm saying.

05:44.825 --> 05:48.021
Do you... do you have a wife...

05:48.101 --> 05:50.959
...that you have to get home to, Mitchel?

05:51.598 --> 05:53.465
Is it Mitchel?

05:54.300 --> 05:56.090
Is your name Mitchel?

05:56.170 --> 05:59.545
- Do I know you?
- I don't know.

06:00.106 --> 06:02.830
Just be straight with me.

06:02.910 --> 06:04.711
I'm being straight with you.

06:06.909 --> 06:08.945
Can I have the early bird special?

06:10.516 --> 06:12.018
Please?

06:12.852 --> 06:14.909
Get the fuck out right now.

06:15.289 --> 06:17.070
Get the fuck out right now.

06:22.161 --> 06:24.029
One, two.

06:45.151 --> 06:46.974
So what's going on?

06:47.354 --> 06:49.177
What the hell was that about?

06:50.257 --> 06:52.340
Why'd you speak to him like that?

06:55.177 --> 06:58.181
I'd have done a lot more given the chance.

06:59.465 --> 07:01.267
Well, who the hell was he?

07:05.805 --> 07:08.463
I don't know. I don't think he was from here.

07:09.093 --> 07:10.976
He was...

07:12.879 --> 07:14.710
Maybe we should call it a night.

07:18.117 --> 07:19.652
Hey!

07:20.553 --> 07:22.388
I told you we're closed.

11:26.198 --> 11:28.855
- Morning, sunshine.
- Hey, Sam. Is this too loud?

11:28.935 --> 11:30.824
Not even a little bit.

11:31.204 --> 11:34.127
- Coffee fresh?
- Made it this morning.

11:34.207 --> 11:37.498
You're an angel, Mags. Heaven sent.

11:37.978 --> 11:40.500
- Tell you that too much?
- Nope.

11:40.580 --> 11:43.036
That's a good thing. Want to know why?

11:43.116 --> 11:46.223
- Why?
- 'Cause I ain't never gonna quit.

11:46.603 --> 11:48.375
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

11:48.455 --> 11:51.657
- Where's Rosie?
- She's on cleaning duty.

11:52.791 --> 11:56.462
- No school today?
- Yeah, not till 9:30.

11:59.431 --> 12:01.901
I got another complaint about room 128.

12:05.197 --> 12:10.297
Hey, Sam, I was wondering, could I pick up
a few extra shifts before the holidays?

12:10.377 --> 12:14.334
- Thinking about going on a trip.
- Trip? Where you thinking about going?

12:14.414 --> 12:17.170
Don't know yet. Any ideas?

12:17.250 --> 12:21.508
If I were you,
I'd just head out to Spruce Valley.

12:21.988 --> 12:24.377
I was thinking something more like Florida.

12:24.457 --> 12:25.679
- God.
- What?

12:25.759 --> 12:27.915
- You don't go to Florida on purpose, Mags.
- Why?

12:27.995 --> 12:32.119
I'll tell you one thing, I'll tell you that,
'cause Florida... Florida, it's not a trip.

12:32.199 --> 12:34.804
- It's a death sentence.
- What are you jaded?

12:34.884 --> 12:36.935
Jaded. Spell jaded.

12:38.805 --> 12:42.696
There's no end to my wisdom, Mags.
One of these days you are gonna realize that.

12:42.776 --> 12:44.598
You coming to the game?

12:44.678 --> 12:48.168
What kind of question is that?
Am I coming? What do I always tell you?

12:48.248 --> 12:51.972
"I'm the best goddamn point guard
the Mustangs ever had."

12:52.052 --> 12:54.608
It's not just the best,
it's the most generous.

12:54.688 --> 12:57.626
- Never underestimate the power of generosity.
- What are you looking for?

12:57.706 --> 12:59.479
- Papers. Where are the papers?
- Right here.

12:59.559 --> 13:02.749
Thank you. Of course
I'm gonna come to the game.

13:02.829 --> 13:06.097
- I wouldn't miss it for the world.
- Good, 'cause I need a ride.

13:07.167 --> 13:09.401
Well played. You got me.

13:13.672 --> 13:16.496
Are you going to Bernadette's for the wake?

13:16.576 --> 13:18.131
Well...

13:18.211 --> 13:20.045
...I think we all should.

13:20.980 --> 13:22.836
It's real nice of her.

13:23.116 --> 13:25.537
Considering there was no public burial.

13:28.220 --> 13:29.783
There's no...

13:29.863 --> 13:33.697
...there's no words for what these
people are going through, Mags.

13:33.777 --> 13:35.660
No word.

13:48.340 --> 13:51.364
- Disgusting, every single time.
- Well, go to the store.

13:51.444 --> 13:55.335
I'm sure it's just two miles
down the road. It's walking distance.

13:55.415 --> 13:57.638
Mr. Barnes, it's the manager.

13:58.218 --> 14:00.019
Fucking hell.

14:04.590 --> 14:06.713
How you doing, Mr. Barnes? It's Sam.

14:06.793 --> 14:10.584
You know, I'm the manager here at the motel.
I think we met a few days back, right?

14:10.664 --> 14:12.152
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

14:12.232 --> 14:14.855
Look, I hate to bother you, I really do. I...

14:14.935 --> 14:17.457
- I like to... I like to let people sorta...
- What do you want?

14:17.537 --> 14:22.182
Well, unfortunately there's been a couple
of complaints here about your room, see...

14:22.262 --> 14:25.303
- ...and... I'm just...
- Wait a second. What kind of complaints?

14:25.383 --> 14:29.072
Well, noise, sir. There's quite a bit
of noise I here coming out of here...

14:29.152 --> 14:33.010
...and if you could just do me a favor
just try to keep the noise down.

14:39.625 --> 14:41.505
Sure told him?

14:42.095 --> 14:43.896
I laid it down, didn't I?

14:45.130 --> 14:47.154
Good day at the office, sweetheart.

14:47.484 --> 14:49.351
Do good.

15:32.344 --> 15:34.146
You alright?

15:35.913 --> 15:37.437
Yeah.

15:37.817 --> 15:39.840
We were wondering where you were.

15:40.420 --> 15:42.409
There's a big turnout down there.

15:42.489 --> 15:45.524
Josephine thinks somebody
should make a speech.

15:48.994 --> 15:51.229
I wanted to thank you for...

15:52.164 --> 15:54.188
...putting all of this together.

15:55.035 --> 15:58.024
That's all. I gotta run,
it's my mom's waiting.

15:58.104 --> 16:00.572
What am I supposed to do with all his stuff?

16:02.474 --> 16:04.932
We just threw Mitchel's stuff out.

16:05.712 --> 16:09.715
'Cause Mom says it's part
of the cleansing process. A fresh start.

16:11.250 --> 16:14.253
He was a man, Lila.

16:15.187 --> 16:16.985
I know.

16:18.057 --> 16:20.525
I know what you're saying. I do.

16:21.393 --> 16:24.217
- You're not alone.
- I'm sorry.

16:24.297 --> 16:26.502
I mean, listen to me complain.

16:28.233 --> 16:31.558
You and Mitchel didn't get
three years of marriage.

16:31.638 --> 16:34.039
That doesn't mean I've got it any worse.

16:39.328 --> 16:41.363
Maybe they're some place better.

16:43.382 --> 16:45.216
In peace.

16:46.018 --> 16:47.553
Maybe.

16:49.254 --> 16:51.857
Still haven't shed a goddamn tear.

16:53.058 --> 16:55.348
Eighteen years of marriage...

16:55.428 --> 16:57.293
...not one.

16:58.664 --> 17:00.520
It's disgraceful.

17:00.700 --> 17:02.735
You shouldn't talk that way.

17:05.671 --> 17:07.873
I wasn't the best wife, Lila.

17:11.109 --> 17:13.145
I could've been better.

17:15.446 --> 17:17.337
You look organized.

17:17.416 --> 17:19.218
It's all Tom.

17:20.685 --> 17:23.271
Well, Tom didn't really
trust the banks. Did he?

17:23.352 --> 17:24.477
Nope.

17:24.557 --> 17:27.180
Mitchel just always thought
he was avoiding taxes.

17:27.260 --> 17:29.749
Yeah, everyone did...

17:29.829 --> 17:31.703
...but he was right.

17:32.032 --> 17:35.294
Why pay someone an arm
and a leg to keep what's yours?

17:40.773 --> 17:43.196
You let me know if you need anything, okay?

17:44.176 --> 17:47.216
- I'm so sorry, Bernie.
- Yeah.

17:47.896 --> 17:49.880
Me too.

17:50.549 --> 17:52.351
Fucking mess.

17:54.420 --> 17:57.689
Cheryl's having nightmares. Girls too.

18:00.125 --> 18:01.927
What's the chief say?

18:03.962 --> 18:07.841
Well, it's his jurisdiction, but...

18:07.921 --> 18:11.202
...he's talking about bringing
some boys from upstate.

18:12.137 --> 18:16.129
Last thing we need, city officials...

18:16.209 --> 18:18.877
...flashing their badges, asking questions.

18:20.576 --> 18:22.135
Well...

18:22.315 --> 18:24.371
...people want answers, Marty.

18:25.151 --> 18:28.041
- Am I interrupting?
- No, not at all.

18:28.121 --> 18:29.954
Just on my way.

18:30.622 --> 18:33.258
Once again, Bernie, my condolences.

18:34.927 --> 18:36.983
- Cheryl gives her love.
- Thanks.

18:37.063 --> 18:39.064
- Sam.
- Yeah.

18:54.196 --> 18:56.014
Christ, Bern, I...

18:58.684 --> 19:00.508
...don't know what to say.

19:01.788 --> 19:03.789
You don't have to say anything.

19:05.190 --> 19:06.725
Yeah.

19:12.798 --> 19:14.622
Your hair's getting long.

19:16.102 --> 19:17.958
I need to cut it again.

19:18.638 --> 19:20.193
Yeah.

19:20.773 --> 19:22.841
You think I could come by tonight?

19:24.543 --> 19:26.366
I don't know, Bern.

19:26.946 --> 19:28.947
You think that's a good idea?

20:26.438 --> 20:27.939
Elwood?

20:30.375 --> 20:32.372
Ever been to California?

20:32.452 --> 20:35.113
- What?
- California.

20:36.048 --> 20:38.871
My mom was from there.
El Cerrito or some shit.

20:38.951 --> 20:41.908
Born in 1949. You ever been there?

20:41.988 --> 20:43.989
- No.
- No.

20:45.390 --> 20:47.192
Think I wanna go there.

20:52.431 --> 20:54.486
Why did you kill those men?

20:55.434 --> 20:57.323
I did my job.

20:57.603 --> 21:00.593
It was supposed to be just Mitchel.
That's all.

21:00.673 --> 21:04.270
I sent Miles a picture. The one from
last Christmas 'with the beige sweater...

21:04.350 --> 21:07.066
- ...'cause I remember...
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

21:07.146 --> 21:09.436
This isn't Miles' deal anymore.

21:10.016 --> 21:13.473
- I did what had to be done.
- I didn't ask for this.

21:13.953 --> 21:16.976
- Those other men didn't deserve...
- Your husband wasn't coming out of the bar.

21:17.056 --> 21:21.247
It is as simple as that. I was told
he was gonna be out by midnight.

21:21.327 --> 21:23.181
So whose fault is it?

21:25.197 --> 21:28.187
They think it was a robbery.
Fuck! You should be celebrating.

21:28.267 --> 21:30.668
Tell me when I'm gonna get my money.

21:31.503 --> 21:34.827
You don't have to worry about it.
It's all taken care of.

21:34.907 --> 21:37.130
Okay. When?

21:37.710 --> 21:39.432
- Didn't Miles expl...
- When?

21:39.512 --> 21:44.446
This week! I'm gonna go see
our la... Mitchel's lawyer.

21:45.350 --> 21:48.007
I'm owed 50. You remember that.

21:48.087 --> 21:50.722
There's plenty. Mitchel was good with money.

21:52.457 --> 21:54.259
Why did you want him dead?

21:55.660 --> 21:57.496
Did he beat you up?

21:58.764 --> 22:00.598
Something like that?

22:01.867 --> 22:03.401
No.

22:04.236 --> 22:05.737
No.

22:07.406 --> 22:09.608
He was always cheating on me.

22:13.745 --> 22:15.981
Mitchel was a fucking pig.

22:17.182 --> 22:18.983
There you go.

22:25.650 --> 22:27.232
I'll give you my number.

22:29.361 --> 22:31.629
Call me if you need.

22:36.101 --> 22:39.225
Maybe if all... this all works out, I...

22:39.305 --> 22:41.194
...I'll take you to dinner.

22:41.274 --> 22:43.497
Movie, something like that.

22:44.177 --> 22:46.099
What? No.

22:47.179 --> 22:49.081
I'm just kidding.

22:51.616 --> 22:54.764
I don't need to tell you
what's gonna happen...

22:54.844 --> 22:57.872
...if I don't get the money that I'm owed.

22:59.891 --> 23:01.443
You understand?

23:04.129 --> 23:06.519
- Yeah.
- Okay.

23:06.599 --> 23:08.132
Okay.

23:51.243 --> 23:53.044
I brought you a book.

23:56.648 --> 23:58.449
No one saw me.

24:18.003 --> 24:20.238
I really wanna cut this hair.

24:21.473 --> 24:23.196
For what?

24:23.276 --> 24:26.345
You just wanna put me
in a beauty contest, don't you?

24:28.196 --> 24:29.998
It's a lost cause, Bern.

24:31.484 --> 24:33.349
No, you're not.

24:39.491 --> 24:41.361
I love you.

24:41.661 --> 24:43.495
You're out of your mind.

24:46.865 --> 24:48.666
You're a good man.

24:56.708 --> 24:58.543
Tom was a good man.

25:00.946 --> 25:02.514
Right?

25:04.282 --> 25:05.850
Yeah.

25:07.786 --> 25:09.855
I don't know, Bern, it's just...

25:11.256 --> 25:13.458
- ...I liked him, you know?
- Yeah.

25:19.865 --> 25:21.933
Where do you think he is?

25:25.270 --> 25:27.110
I don't know, Bernie.

25:29.458 --> 25:30.976
Heaven.

25:33.044 --> 25:34.846
You really believe that?

25:39.918 --> 25:41.419
No.

25:43.421 --> 25:45.257
I think he's still here.

25:47.859 --> 25:50.495
- I can feel him.
- Yeah.

25:54.532 --> 25:56.956
He'll always be with you, Bern.

25:57.036 --> 25:59.704
We hadn't made love in five years.

26:01.873 --> 26:03.741
I don't know.

26:05.310 --> 26:07.946
You get weighed down by convenience...

26:09.047 --> 26:10.915
...I guess.

26:13.185 --> 26:15.620
You can't overlook something like that.

27:11.643 --> 27:13.265
Hi.

27:13.345 --> 27:17.302
- How ya doing?
- Oh, sorry. My name is Elwood.

27:17.382 --> 27:19.105
'Kay. Sam.

27:19.185 --> 27:21.307
- Hi, Sam. Nice to meet ya.
- Yeah.

27:21.387 --> 27:23.543
I'm staying in room 125.

27:23.623 --> 27:26.045
A pretty girl checked me
in a few nights back.

27:26.125 --> 27:29.072
I said that I'd be out
by this evening, but...

27:29.152 --> 27:32.591
- ...there's been a slight change of plan.
- Yeah, no problem, let me just...

27:32.671 --> 27:34.877
...just check the book.

27:34.957 --> 27:36.816
You said...

27:37.136 --> 27:40.059
- You said, what, 1... 125?
- 1...

27:40.139 --> 27:43.996
1-2-5. That's the one. I was hoping I could
just hold on to it for a couple more days.

27:44.076 --> 27:47.633
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, room's all yours. It's...

27:47.713 --> 27:49.502
Oh, great.

27:49.882 --> 27:51.883
Just doing my job, is all.

27:56.521 --> 27:59.157
- You a Nazi?
- Sorry?

28:01.826 --> 28:03.628
Oh, the...

28:04.395 --> 28:06.452
...used to belong to my grandfather.

28:06.532 --> 28:09.916
He took it off a German soldier
there in the war.

28:09.996 --> 28:11.824
He use to tell us that he used it too.

28:11.904 --> 28:14.060
He never would've made it home
without it, he said.

28:14.740 --> 28:17.438
What happened to the man that
it belonged to? The German did...

28:17.518 --> 28:20.032
- ...did your grandfather shoot him?
- He said he didn't.

28:20.112 --> 28:22.635
I guess he just... found the guy there.

28:22.715 --> 28:27.773
He was slumped under a tree and he was
holding on to a picture of sweetheart, so...

28:27.853 --> 28:32.290
- How'd he die then?
- I don't know. Broken heart, I guess.

28:33.124 --> 28:37.584
- Better than a bullet.
- Yeah, maybe, maybe not, right?

28:38.664 --> 28:43.858
- I'm real glad we got this worked out...
- Holy fuck! Holy fucking shit!

28:43.938 --> 28:46.826
- What?
- I knew it.

28:46.906 --> 28:51.897
I knew it as soon as I saw you outside.
That's you! You're the young rodeo champ.

28:51.977 --> 28:54.900
- The bull rider, Russo.
- Well, Rossi.

28:54.980 --> 28:58.350
- Rossi. That's what it is.
- Not so young anymore, but, yes.

28:58.430 --> 29:01.874
Man, my daddy would have a heart attack
if he could see you right now, you know that?

29:01.954 --> 29:04.476
- Is that right?
- He's a Virginia man too, like yourself.

29:04.556 --> 29:06.479
- Okay. Which part?
- He raised me in Lynchburg.

29:06.559 --> 29:09.200
- Okay. Okay. Yeah.
- Yeah. Wow.

29:09.280 --> 29:12.151
He used to drive out to all your shows.
He used to go out of state too.

29:12.231 --> 29:14.119
- Wyoming, Tennessee.
- Okay.

29:14.199 --> 29:17.116
He used to save all your newspaper
clippings with your pictures...

29:17.196 --> 29:18.891
...he worshipped the ground
that you walked on.

29:18.971 --> 29:20.092
Okay.

29:20.172 --> 29:21.961
- Wow.
- Yeah.

29:22.041 --> 29:24.730
Hey, you must get recognized here. Right?

29:24.810 --> 29:27.767
It must get on your nerves all the time.
People coming up to you and everything.

29:27.847 --> 29:30.403
No. I mean, up here people,
they don't know about that.

29:30.483 --> 29:33.339
If they did, they forgot.
Doesn't really bother me either way, so...

29:33.419 --> 29:36.004
- They're fucking idiots.
- Well, you know, it's just...

29:36.084 --> 29:38.344
...it's far away from Virginia is all, so...

29:38.424 --> 29:40.844
- No, no.
- It's really not.

29:40.924 --> 29:43.615
- Alright.
- Yep.

29:43.695 --> 29:47.328
- See you tomorrow, Sam.
- Well, I'm glad we...

29:47.408 --> 29:49.421
- ...get to...
- Holy shit.

29:49.501 --> 29:52.925
Do me a favor, say hello
to the old man for me, alright?

29:53.005 --> 29:54.884
- What?
- I just...

29:54.964 --> 29:57.429
...pass my regards to your father.

29:57.509 --> 30:00.900
I can't do that. He's dead, so...

30:00.980 --> 30:03.435
- Sorry to hear that.
- Nah. I'll see ya.

30:03.515 --> 30:05.149
Yeah.

30:19.831 --> 30:23.089
Sorry about the wait.
Can I get you something to drink?

30:24.469 --> 30:26.504
No. No, thank you.

30:27.405 --> 30:30.129
- So, Miss McCabe...
- Lila, please.

30:30.209 --> 30:31.731
Lila.

30:32.061 --> 30:37.482
I don't really know if it's my place to
discuss such a formidable matter, but...

30:39.417 --> 30:43.020
...were you aware of your
husband's financial difficulties?

30:44.055 --> 30:45.778
"Difficulties?"

30:45.858 --> 30:47.714
His troubles?

30:48.294 --> 30:50.983
As you're probably aware, I hadn't
seen Mitchel in a number of years...

30:51.063 --> 30:55.155
...so this is relatively new
information for both of us.

30:56.135 --> 31:00.226
Anyway, I ran some credit checks
and I called the taxation department...

31:00.306 --> 31:03.763
The taxation? Wait, I don't understand.

31:04.843 --> 31:07.282
Your husband was bankrupt.

31:07.980 --> 31:12.037
- I'm sorry to be the one to lay that on...
- No, no, Mitchel was an entrepreneur.

31:12.117 --> 31:14.919
A businessman. He had thousands of dollars.

31:15.753 --> 31:19.390
How much did you really know
about your husband's businesses?

31:20.224 --> 31:22.615
Two former partners were suing him.

31:22.695 --> 31:25.150
He's had run-ins with the IRS
for several years.

31:25.230 --> 31:27.498
What about the will?

31:29.500 --> 31:31.369
The insurance?

31:32.392 --> 31:34.693
He showed me papers, I...

31:34.773 --> 31:37.041
Those policies don't exist.

31:38.209 --> 31:40.265
I have bills.

31:40.345 --> 31:42.213
I have expenses.

31:43.264 --> 31:45.137
I'm sorry, but...

31:45.417 --> 31:47.440
...none of that carries any weight.

31:48.020 --> 31:50.888
It's of no consequence and now...

31:52.223 --> 31:54.280
...the bank owns your home.

31:54.560 --> 31:58.717
But I... I still need to make
a payment on the casket.

31:58.797 --> 32:02.224
It was solid mahogany.
I can't give that back.

32:05.737 --> 32:07.238
If...

32:08.106 --> 32:10.163
...if I had known about...

32:10.943 --> 32:12.798
...any of this, then...

32:12.878 --> 32:16.924
...I would've thrown
that monster out with the trash.

32:52.483 --> 32:55.887
Thanks. Close the door behind you.

33:49.654 --> 33:52.331
- Hey, hey.
- Shit.

33:52.611 --> 33:54.166
Hey.

33:54.546 --> 33:56.413
Been painting the town?

33:57.683 --> 34:01.173
Something like that, it's a retirement party.

34:02.465 --> 34:04.354
Hope it wasn't your own.

34:05.124 --> 34:08.087
How 'bout you? What are you
doing up so late? Causing mischief?

34:08.266 --> 34:10.549
No, not at all. Just can't sleep.

34:10.629 --> 34:13.418
Was thinking about going to that diner
there up the road, grabbing a bite.

34:13.498 --> 34:15.966
- It's pretty good.
- Yeah?

34:16.367 --> 34:20.092
- Wanna join me?
- I appreciate it, but, no, I gotta work.

34:20.172 --> 34:22.695
- Oh, come on.
- No, no. I gotta work.

34:22.775 --> 34:24.963
Shift starts at midnight,
but you have a good time.

34:25.043 --> 34:27.878
I'll have you back before 12:00. Promise.

34:29.480 --> 34:31.282
Come on, Cinderella.

34:34.252 --> 34:36.141
- Alright.
- Yeah?

34:36.221 --> 34:38.310
- Sure.
- Should I drive?

34:38.389 --> 34:41.036
No, let's... let's take the truck.

34:41.116 --> 34:42.960
Let me lock up.

34:48.331 --> 34:50.134
Thank you, ma'am.

34:54.972 --> 34:57.063
Sure you don't want nothing to eat?

34:57.593 --> 35:01.200
Nope. Just... just coffee for me. That's it.

35:01.580 --> 35:04.670
- Not sure how you do it though.
- What?

35:05.150 --> 35:08.118
If I was eating all that sugar,
I'd be bouncing off the walls.

35:08.953 --> 35:11.376
- It doesn't affect me.
- Is that right?

35:11.456 --> 35:13.845
Look at that. Steady as a clam.

35:13.925 --> 35:15.493
Okay.

35:18.095 --> 35:20.185
- No offense.
- Hey.

35:20.265 --> 35:22.387
Hey. It's alright. None taken.

35:22.467 --> 35:25.102
- That wasn't a dig.
- I understand.

35:28.272 --> 35:31.497
What... what is that, anyway?

35:31.977 --> 35:34.800
- The... with the shake?
- My hand there?

35:34.880 --> 35:37.269
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's...

35:37.349 --> 35:39.905
- Is that rude? Okay.
- No, no, no.

35:39.985 --> 35:44.413
I guess I just took one too many falls,
you know? Got bumped on the head.

35:45.724 --> 35:49.202
You see, doctors,
they call it early onset, see?

35:49.282 --> 35:53.293
So, I guess it's only going
in one direction and that's just...

35:53.799 --> 35:56.668
...you know, that's just the way it is.

36:05.776 --> 36:07.812
Thanks for keeping me company.

36:10.514 --> 36:12.550
I didn't know if you'd be up.

36:13.985 --> 36:15.874
It's alright.

36:15.954 --> 36:18.389
Haven't really been sleeping much lately.

36:19.450 --> 36:20.991
Yeah.

36:22.793 --> 36:24.661
Me neither.

36:26.764 --> 36:29.834
It's like every time I close
my eyes I have a nightmare.

36:33.788 --> 36:37.863
Mom says I used to get bad dreams
as a girl every summer.

36:37.943 --> 36:41.792
And she used to have to sing me
Christmas carols to get to sleep.

36:42.713 --> 36:45.750
- Did it work?
- I guess.

36:56.527 --> 36:58.395
You miss riding?

36:59.430 --> 37:00.931
Ever?

37:02.199 --> 37:04.523
To be honest, no, I don't.

37:04.603 --> 37:07.004
- Yeah.
- I just don't.

37:08.606 --> 37:10.407
I mean...

37:10.758 --> 37:14.466
...I can see how a fall like that
can put off any young rider.

37:14.546 --> 37:16.380
Even you.

37:18.582 --> 37:21.506
- Yeah.
- But now you're in the motel business.

37:21.586 --> 37:23.467
Yes, I am.

37:25.057 --> 37:29.474
The place belonged to my brother
so I got it from him.

37:30.028 --> 37:31.717
How's that?

37:31.797 --> 37:35.421
Well, he... well, he died, you know?

37:35.901 --> 37:40.171
Didn't have a wife, didn't have kids, anything
like that so I guess I was next in line.

37:43.908 --> 37:45.409
Man.

37:48.479 --> 37:50.347
You know...

37:50.715 --> 37:54.539
...when my mother passed
she left me with nothing, either.

37:54.619 --> 37:56.141
Nothing.

37:56.421 --> 37:58.488
Her only son too. Imagine that.

38:00.524 --> 38:02.381
But she had it tough.

38:02.461 --> 38:04.650
Full-blown tuberculosis.

38:04.730 --> 38:06.485
Spread like wildfire.

38:06.565 --> 38:09.221
- She was a skeleton by the end.
- Jesus. I'm sorry...

38:09.301 --> 38:12.057
My father wasn't around
to take care of her either...

38:12.137 --> 38:16.140
...'cause he was serving time
in El Reno, Oklahoma.

38:16.907 --> 38:20.398
He shot a federal judge
over a previous conviction.

38:20.478 --> 38:22.880
Grand-theft auto, I think it was.

38:23.714 --> 38:25.737
But he got his comeuppance.

38:25.817 --> 38:28.107
He was stabbed in a prison riot.

38:28.987 --> 38:31.872
Christmas Eve, 1996.

38:33.107 --> 38:35.793
They said he was dead
before he even hit the ground.

38:37.828 --> 38:39.329
So...

38:40.598 --> 38:42.633
...what goes around comes around.

38:51.776 --> 38:53.277
Okay.

38:54.445 --> 38:55.974
What flavor?

38:56.054 --> 38:57.939
- Surprise me.
- Okay.

38:58.019 --> 39:00.431
- Let me give you some money.
- No, no, it's fine.

39:01.719 --> 39:04.154
So you got a woman?

39:04.929 --> 39:06.991
Must be a woman in your life.

39:08.726 --> 39:11.016
Yeah, a woman, yeah.

39:11.196 --> 39:15.232
You know, I don't...
I don't talk about it much, but...

39:17.385 --> 39:20.859
...yeah. Yeah, I guess there is, I guess.

39:20.939 --> 39:23.407
I guess, yeah, I guess I got a woman. Yeah.

39:25.176 --> 39:26.944
She special?

39:30.781 --> 39:32.583
Yeah, she is.

39:34.718 --> 39:37.042
- That's good.
- Yeah.

39:37.122 --> 39:39.156
Make sure you hold onto that.

39:41.560 --> 39:43.915
I mean, my parents' marriage
was built on damn lies, you know...

39:43.995 --> 39:46.997
Wait a sec, is that... hey, Lila!

39:49.099 --> 39:50.634
Hey.

39:51.569 --> 39:54.559
Hey. How are you?

39:54.639 --> 39:57.125
- Hanging in there?
- I'm okay. I'm surviving.

39:57.205 --> 40:00.099
- How are you?
- Okay, good, good, good.

40:00.579 --> 40:04.672
This is... this is Elwood.
He's staying at the motel, he's...

40:05.082 --> 40:08.140
- Hi.
- He's from Virginia, same as me, so...

40:08.220 --> 40:10.976
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- You too.

40:11.056 --> 40:14.123
So, what brings you out so late?

40:14.493 --> 40:17.943
Some milkshakes.
We're watching a movie over at...

40:18.023 --> 40:19.650
Which one?

40:19.730 --> 40:21.753
- What?
- What movie?

40:21.833 --> 40:24.456
It's... it's an oldie.

40:24.536 --> 40:28.003
- It's with Rock Hudson.
- Oh, he's awful.

40:31.442 --> 40:33.899
I should... get going.

40:33.979 --> 40:37.102
- Bernie's waiting outside in the car.
- Is she here?

40:37.182 --> 40:38.704
Okay.

40:39.324 --> 40:40.872
Yeah.

40:41.152 --> 40:43.661
- It's really good to see you.
- And you.

40:43.741 --> 40:46.624
- Yeah.
- And nice meeting you.

40:51.529 --> 40:53.385
Wow.

40:53.665 --> 40:55.532
She's pretty.

40:58.903 --> 41:01.793
- Hey, I'm going to hit the head.
- Okay.

41:01.873 --> 41:03.708
Give me a minute, alright?

41:44.148 --> 41:46.038
What'd you go for?

41:46.618 --> 41:48.185
Chocolate.

41:48.986 --> 41:51.655
- You okay?
- Yeah.

41:52.406 --> 41:55.014
- Why?
- You look pale.

41:55.694 --> 41:57.227
No.

41:58.295 --> 42:00.130
I'm just tired.

42:38.335 --> 42:39.903
Tom?

42:41.038 --> 42:44.475
Tom, a bird just flew into the window.

42:47.411 --> 42:48.946
Tom?

42:51.982 --> 42:53.550
Tom?

42:56.120 --> 42:57.209
Tom?

42:57.289 --> 43:00.010
- How long have you been fucking him?
- What?

43:01.993 --> 43:04.394
Sorry. Sorry.

43:16.607 --> 43:18.609
You want me to sing you a carol?

43:27.150 --> 43:28.952
I'm okay.

43:38.872 --> 43:41.247
<i>You're saying that you don't believe...</i>

43:41.327 --> 43:45.214
<i>...the major problem, the major moral
issue confronts our country today...</i>

43:45.294 --> 43:49.227
<i>...is not pornography,
it's not sexuality, it's not abortion...</i>

43:49.307 --> 43:52.764
<i>...it's not liberalized education
or any of these other things...</i>

43:52.844 --> 43:55.033
<i>...that we typically identify.</i>

43:55.113 --> 44:00.005
<i>The real basic moral problem in America
is the lack of confidence in one God.</i>

44:00.085 --> 44:01.439
<i>Well, yeah, that's absolutely right.</i>

44:01.519 --> 44:04.542
<i>The lack of not only the lack
of confidence in the word of God...</i>

44:04.622 --> 44:08.458
<i>...but the lack of submission to it
is the absolute point. Even I would...</i>

44:16.533 --> 44:21.359
<i>I saw the most gross obscene,
pornographic stuff...</i>

44:21.439 --> 44:23.261
<i>...painted in frescoes...</i>

44:23.341 --> 44:27.777
<i>...in the first century in Italy.</i>

44:38.656 --> 44:41.279
<i>...just bent on sexuality...</i>

44:41.959 --> 44:44.127
<i>...heterosexual scene and...</i>

44:51.201 --> 44:55.893
<i>...homosexuality, where they wanna rape
the angels that show up, they're so base.</i>

44:56.573 --> 45:01.211
<i>Even abortion. If you go back
in history, abortion has been done...</i>

45:08.419 --> 45:10.842
<i>And, so, those aren't the issues.</i>

45:10.922 --> 45:15.547
<i>The issue is all of that runs
absolutely rampant...</i>

45:15.627 --> 45:18.249
<i>...when there is no fixed standard.</i>

45:18.329 --> 45:20.758
<i>And this nation...</i>

47:20.818 --> 47:22.840
- Sam?
- Yeah?

47:22.920 --> 47:24.754
Bernie's here.

47:28.158 --> 47:32.016
- You alright?
- Yeah. Yeah.

47:32.096 --> 47:36.333
- I'll tell her you're in the shower.
- Okay. Yeah.

47:42.973 --> 47:44.362
- Hey, Bern.
- Hey.

47:44.442 --> 47:45.966
Hey.

47:47.077 --> 47:49.301
Sorry to drop by unannounced.

47:49.881 --> 47:52.604
Rose said you were taking a shower,
I just thought I'd wait.

47:52.684 --> 47:54.205
Yeah.

47:54.485 --> 47:57.954
So, what, you just...
you just in the neighborhood or...

47:59.823 --> 48:01.647
I thought maybe...

48:02.227 --> 48:06.650
...you might wanna come over for dinner.
Tomorrow night, I mean.

48:07.130 --> 48:09.766
- But, you know, if...
- No. I...

48:13.535 --> 48:16.097
Yeah, it sounds great, but...

48:16.177 --> 48:19.297
...you know, I do have plans tomorrow,
so I don't know if that's gonna...

48:19.377 --> 48:22.800
- No biggie.
- It's Maggie, you know, playoffs.

48:22.880 --> 48:25.904
I told her I'd take her to have some...
just I gotta do it. Okay?

48:25.984 --> 48:27.850
That's nice.

48:29.151 --> 48:30.346
Well...

48:30.426 --> 48:34.032
You know if you wanted, I could come by
later, you know, after I drop her off...

48:34.112 --> 48:37.283
...if that's... if that's good to you.

48:38.163 --> 48:40.718
- I'd like that.
- Well...

48:40.798 --> 48:42.387
- Alright.
- Yeah.

48:42.467 --> 48:45.023
Rose, thank you.
It was nice talking with you.

48:45.103 --> 48:46.501
- Take care, hon.
- Bye, now.

48:46.581 --> 48:48.137
Okay.

49:33.717 --> 49:35.218
Ma?

49:35.886 --> 49:38.121
Hey, Ma? It's me.

49:41.658 --> 49:43.548
It's your son.

49:43.628 --> 49:45.429
It's your son, Ma.

49:47.531 --> 49:49.588
Yeah, it's your boy.

49:50.614 --> 49:53.636
<i>Miss you. I thought you were dead.</i>

49:56.373 --> 49:58.207
Hey, Ma.

49:59.509 --> 50:04.235
Ma, listen. I'm out of state right now, okay?

50:04.315 --> 50:06.771
I'm working though,
and I'm making some money.

50:06.851 --> 50:09.319
And I'm sorry I haven't called in a while.

50:14.558 --> 50:16.426
I love you, Ma.

50:19.163 --> 50:21.364
Ma, do you hear me? I love you.

51:51.888 --> 51:54.245
Fucking faggot piece of shit.

51:54.325 --> 51:56.380
What? What did you say?

51:56.460 --> 51:59.462
What'd you say? What'd you say?

52:00.997 --> 52:02.887
You got a fucking problem?

52:03.567 --> 52:05.368
Yeah, fuck off.

52:13.577 --> 52:15.466
Keep looking at me.

52:15.546 --> 52:17.947
Keep looking at me, you fucker.

52:18.815 --> 52:21.251
Keep fucking looking at me.

52:29.793 --> 52:33.115
Look at me, you waste of life.
Look at me, you fucking waste of life.

52:33.195 --> 52:36.265
- I'll fucking kill you.
- What the fuck you looking at?

52:40.737 --> 52:45.208
Pick up your fucking phone, you cunt!
Pick up your fucking phone!

52:46.810 --> 52:51.301
- Don't worry about it. Come here. Fuck him.
- Come on, motherfucker. Get it.

52:51.381 --> 52:52.916
Hey!

52:53.718 --> 52:55.539
Get the fuck...

Get your fucking hand down, you fuck!

53:23.664 --> 53:25.665

53:33.356 --> 53:37.794
<i>Pick up your fucking phone, you cunt.
Pick up your fucking phone!</i>

54:01.751 --> 54:06.022
Just for a little bit. I've been sitting
around the house with nobody to talk to.

54:07.924 --> 54:10.126
Does he want me to bring Mitchel's cat?

54:12.956 --> 54:14.497
Okay.

54:14.798 --> 54:16.866
Yeah. I know.

54:18.369 --> 54:20.225
I love you too, Mom.

54:20.905 --> 54:22.411
Bye.

55:29.140 --> 55:32.930
- Where's my money?
- I don't have it. I don't have it.

55:33.010 --> 55:36.567
I don't have enough. I can get it.
I can get it! I can get it! I can get it!

55:36.647 --> 55:40.683
I can get it! Please, please.
I can get it. I can get it.

55:41.976 --> 55:44.453
- Please.
- Where are you gonna get it?

55:47.824 --> 55:50.059
I know where.

56:38.842 --> 56:41.799
What the fuck you looking at,
you fat asshole?

56:41.879 --> 56:44.034
Fat fucking piece of shit.

56:44.114 --> 56:46.837
Look at me like that again,
I'll knock your fucking teeth out.

56:46.917 --> 56:50.139
You look like a fat fucking woman,
you fucking bitch.

57:06.302 --> 57:09.539
Are you Paul? Paul Anderson?

57:11.190 --> 57:14.521
- Who wants to know?
- I'm a friend of Miles.

57:14.601 --> 57:16.412
He said you're reliable.

57:17.914 --> 57:21.005
Alright, just... give me a second.

57:21.085 --> 57:22.619
Okay.

57:26.289 --> 57:28.946
- So Fairvale?
- Yeah.

57:29.026 --> 57:30.893
It's a pretty small town.

57:31.661 --> 57:33.184
- When's the job?
- Tonight.

57:33.264 --> 57:34.685
- Tonight, tonight?
- Yeah.

57:34.765 --> 57:36.621
I can't do it tonight.

57:37.001 --> 57:39.657
I can't. I got a date tonight.

57:39.737 --> 57:42.460
I made reservations and everything.
It's French food. I can't.

57:42.540 --> 57:44.344
French food?

57:45.174 --> 57:47.276
You want this money or no?

57:52.382 --> 57:54.571
- You got a gun?
- I ain't shooting nobody.

57:54.651 --> 57:56.640
It's just for protection.

57:56.720 --> 57:58.955
If not a pistol, then something sharp.

58:02.700 --> 58:05.249
- Those things'll kill you.
- Bullshit.

58:05.329 --> 58:09.332
My grandfather still smokes.
He's 83 years old. He's healthy as a horse.

58:10.056 --> 58:11.934
He'll be dead soon.

58:45.268 --> 58:48.059
Defense. Defense.

58:48.139 --> 58:50.770
Defense. Defense.

58:50.850 --> 58:53.541
Defense. Defense.

58:53.621 --> 58:56.924

You alright, champ?

Never better.

59:26.876 --> 59:29.879
Yeah. You'll play 'em again next week.

59:32.850 --> 59:34.672
You learn anything tonight?

59:35.052 --> 59:38.287
- Yeah, I can't trust my team members...
- Stop that, will ya?

59:40.391 --> 59:42.680
Saw number two shooting there
with the left hand?

59:42.760 --> 59:44.848
- Yeah. You saw that.
- Yeah. I got to drive her right.

59:44.928 --> 59:47.797
That's it. She's gonna hate you next week.

59:52.368 --> 59:54.236
Yeah, you did great.

59:54.991 --> 59:57.474
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah.

01:00:01.744 --> 01:00:03.814
I know my dad never would.

01:00:10.653 --> 01:00:12.543
Mags, I love coming.

01:00:13.123 --> 01:00:15.192
Watching you out there, that...

01:00:19.495 --> 01:00:21.565
I mean, I don't...

01:00:24.567 --> 01:00:26.069
I...

01:00:27.303 --> 01:00:30.795
I don't... I don't talk about it but...

01:00:31.475 --> 01:00:33.310
...you know...

01:00:35.394 --> 01:00:37.935
...I know you and Rosie, you know that...

01:00:38.015 --> 01:00:39.803
...you know that...

01:00:39.883 --> 01:00:41.639
...that I...

01:00:41.719 --> 01:00:43.554
...that I had a daughter.

01:00:47.223 --> 01:00:49.059
You know that, right?

01:00:49.792 --> 01:00:52.061
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:00:54.397 --> 01:00:56.186
I know...

01:00:56.266 --> 01:00:59.590
...I know you're cross
at your old man and I get that.

01:00:59.670 --> 01:01:01.559
But you should know that...

01:01:02.639 --> 01:01:04.441
...some part of him...

01:01:06.409 --> 01:01:09.447
...he wishes he could've been
here tonight. I promise you that.

01:01:16.786 --> 01:01:19.634
Sam, you would've been the best dad to her.

01:01:24.494 --> 01:01:26.056
Yeah.

01:01:28.531 --> 01:01:30.100
Yeah.

01:02:22.969 --> 01:02:24.837
Nobody saw you.

01:02:27.506 --> 01:02:29.959
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.

01:02:48.855 --> 01:02:50.567
<i>Can't get your game? No one can.</i>

01:02:50.647 --> 01:02:53.737
<i>Football seven days a week only
at the Fairvale Wing Factory.</i>

01:02:53.817 --> 01:02:55.652
<i>Please drink responsibly.</i>

01:02:57.220 --> 01:03:01.186
<i>There's absolutely no words
to describe this... this atrocity...</i>

01:03:01.266 --> 01:03:03.614
<i>...that occurred in our city...</i>

01:03:03.694 --> 01:03:07.901

is working diligently...</i>

01:03:07.981 --> 01:03:10.688
<i>...to bring those responsible to justice.</i>

01:03:10.768 --> 01:03:14.999
<i>Please pray with me for the victims'
families in this trying time.</i>

01:03:15.639 --> 01:03:18.362
<i>That was police chief Kyle Kerry
speaking earlier today...</i>

01:03:18.442 --> 01:03:21.311
<i>...at a press conference
about the Fairvale mass...</i>

01:03:45.952 --> 01:03:47.480
Hey.

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:49.311
What time is it?

01:03:49.906 --> 01:03:51.708
It's late.

01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:56.433
- Don't do that. Hey.
- No.

01:03:56.513 --> 01:03:58.268
I tried so hard to be quiet too.

01:03:58.348 --> 01:04:02.506
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:04:02.586 --> 01:04:04.475
Why're you dressed?

01:04:04.755 --> 01:04:06.310
Morning.

01:04:06.690 --> 01:04:10.126
Good morning. Gotta go.

01:04:11.394 --> 01:04:14.116
You don't have to. I'll make breakfast.

01:04:14.196 --> 01:04:15.999
You can eat it in bed.

01:04:18.868 --> 01:04:20.757
Sounds so good.

01:04:20.837 --> 01:04:23.873
- But?
- I can't.

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:26.910
You can't or you won't?

01:04:33.382 --> 01:04:35.652
Bern, I gotta go now.

01:04:36.786 --> 01:04:38.788
Where? Where you gotta...

01:04:39.755 --> 01:04:41.324
Bern.

01:04:42.625 --> 01:04:44.194
Stop.

01:04:51.984 --> 01:04:53.868
You still wanna do this?

01:04:57.874 --> 01:04:59.697
I just don't even...

01:05:00.277 --> 01:05:02.145
What are you doing?

01:05:04.447 --> 01:05:06.316
I'm asking you.

01:05:07.183 --> 01:05:08.672
Yeah.

01:05:08.752 --> 01:05:10.587
So stay.

01:05:11.487 --> 01:05:12.943
I want you to stay.

01:05:13.023 --> 01:05:16.715
And I'm telling you that I cannot. Okay?

01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:19.262
- Kiss me goodbye.
- No.

01:07:50.846 --> 01:07:53.370
Howdy, ma'am. Anybody helping you?

01:07:53.450 --> 01:07:56.239
I'm staying in room 129.
I booked it this morning.

01:07:56.319 --> 01:07:58.909
Alright. I hope everything's going okay.

01:07:58.989 --> 01:08:03.647
Yeah. There seems to be some
sort of fight next door. 128.

01:08:03.727 --> 01:08:06.162
- A fight?
- I heard screaming.

01:08:07.363 --> 01:08:09.886
Alright. You stay dry, okay?

01:08:09.966 --> 01:08:13.003
Take care, and sorry for the inconvenience.

01:08:35.457 --> 01:08:39.095
- Get off of me!
- Get away from me. Get off me!

01:08:43.066 --> 01:08:45.268
- Shut up!
- No!

01:08:50.073 --> 01:08:52.696
You again. What's the fucking problem now?

01:08:52.776 --> 01:08:54.812
I think you know what the problem is.

01:09:04.252 --> 01:09:07.090
Stop it! Stop it!

01:09:08.157 --> 01:09:12.499
Stop! What the... what the fuck
are you doing? Stop it!

01:09:12.578 --> 01:09:15.618
- You fucker? What are you gonna do now?
- What the fuck are you doing?

01:09:15.698 --> 01:09:20.537
You son of a bitch, I fucking told you!
Don't knock on the door! Fuck you!

01:11:27.229 --> 01:11:29.031
Follow her.

01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:46.516
Fuck.

01:12:00.663 --> 01:12:03.453
Listen, open the door.
Open this door, listen!

01:12:03.533 --> 01:12:06.535
Just fucking open the door. Okay?

01:12:19.722 --> 01:12:22.778
Come on, fuck! Open this fucking door!

01:12:30.459 --> 01:12:32.395
Open this fucking door!

01:13:32.988 --> 01:13:34.790
Fucking hell!

01:15:14.696 --> 01:15:17.547
- Sir, you can't park here.
- What the hell's going on?

01:15:18.327 --> 01:15:19.896
Bern?

01:15:24.833 --> 01:15:27.437
Come here. Come here.

01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:39.255
I got you.

01:17:43.572 --> 01:17:45.128
Hey.

01:17:45.208 --> 01:17:48.898
- I thought you were still at the hospital.
- Yeah, I was.

01:17:48.978 --> 01:17:53.416
I'm going to get over to Bern's, get the
place fixed up before they cut her loose.

01:17:55.784 --> 01:17:59.175
- You've gotta go to school today, Mags.
- No, I don't mind. Let me help.

01:17:59.255 --> 01:18:02.445
Don't let this craziness get in the way
of what you've gotta do. Alright?

01:18:02.525 --> 01:18:05.948
Go on, get your stuff.
I'll give you a ride on the way in.

01:18:06.028 --> 01:18:09.064
- How is she?
- She's getting there.

01:18:09.781 --> 01:18:11.784
When is she coming back home?

01:18:13.101 --> 01:18:14.903
Soon enough.

01:18:15.637 --> 01:18:17.694
I heard she killed one of them, Sam.

01:18:18.374 --> 01:18:20.242
Is that true?

01:18:22.210 --> 01:18:23.832
Yeah.

01:18:23.912 --> 01:18:25.535
Who was it?

01:18:25.615 --> 01:18:28.905
Was just some kid.

01:18:29.085 --> 01:18:32.041
And the other one just got away?
He's still out there?

01:18:32.121 --> 01:18:35.545
Yeah, but he's cut up bad.

01:18:35.625 --> 01:18:38.548
Police know what to look for.
They're gonna search the hospitals.

01:18:38.628 --> 01:18:41.517
He ain't gonna get far. It's gonna be okay.

01:18:41.597 --> 01:18:43.653
Are you okay?

01:18:43.733 --> 01:18:46.656
Yeah. I am.

01:18:46.736 --> 01:18:51.179
Things like this, Mags, you've just...
just gotta let 'em pass through, wait it out.

01:18:53.208 --> 01:18:55.411
Now get your stuff. I'll get the car.

01:19:33.148 --> 01:19:34.950
Hey, pal.

01:19:35.350 --> 01:19:38.174
- Hey, Sam.
- Seen your light on.

01:19:38.254 --> 01:19:40.557
Was wondering if you were up this early.

01:19:41.557 --> 01:19:44.560
- Yeah, it's early.
- Leaving us?

01:19:45.193 --> 01:19:47.971
- Yeah, going home.
- Going back South?

01:19:48.361 --> 01:19:49.898
Yeah.

01:19:51.433 --> 01:19:54.269
Well, it's been nice having you.

01:19:58.894 --> 01:20:01.364
I'll just go ahead and get the rest
of your stuff for you.

01:20:01.444 --> 01:20:03.846
No, no, I'm alright. I don't need help.

01:20:10.285 --> 01:20:11.608
You're bleeding.

01:20:17.125 --> 01:20:22.334
Yep. I got into a little accident yesterday,
a little car accident, but I'm okay.

01:20:22.414 --> 01:20:24.300
You had an accident?

01:20:26.251 --> 01:20:27.770
Yep.

01:20:29.571 --> 01:20:31.277
What are you doing?

01:20:32.273 --> 01:20:33.842
Sam.

01:20:36.044 --> 01:20:37.843
- Hey, Sam.
- Piece of shit.

01:20:40.316 --> 01:20:41.884
Sam!

01:20:43.271 --> 01:20:46.019
- Sam!
- Hey, get back in the room!

01:20:46.099 --> 01:20:47.790
- Get back!
- Sam!

01:23:41.362 --> 01:23:43.171
Put that gun down.

01:23:51.756 --> 01:23:54.643
I'm leaving, Sam. Okay?

01:23:54.953 --> 01:23:57.733
You just... you put it down.

01:23:57.813 --> 01:23:59.615
That thing still shoot?

01:24:01.316 --> 01:24:04.720
Put the gun down, I'm not gonna
say it again, I will shoot you dead.

01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:07.355
That's it.

01:24:08.723 --> 01:24:10.580
I'm out of your hair, okay?

01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:13.549
I'm gonna call this square, Sam,
between me and you.

01:24:13.629 --> 01:24:16.024
- You just...
- But I've got to go.

01:24:16.104 --> 01:24:18.233
Just walk away from the car, alright?
Just walk away...

01:24:18.313 --> 01:24:19.879
- I didn't mean to shoot that man.
- Sam, let him go.

01:24:19.979 --> 01:24:22.314
Hey, you go back in the office! Go back now!

01:24:22.394 --> 01:24:25.340
You should listen to her. Okay?

01:24:26.574 --> 01:24:28.898
I'm not letting you leave.
You just walk away from the car.

01:24:28.978 --> 01:24:31.300
No, no, no. No, no, no.

01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:33.615
- Walk away.
- I can't.

01:24:34.282 --> 01:24:36.816
- I can't. I'm sorry.
- You just...

01:24:37.186 --> 01:24:38.874
- ...stop.
- I can't.

01:24:38.954 --> 01:24:41.480
Hey, stop. Stop.
