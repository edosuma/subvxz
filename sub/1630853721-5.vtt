WEBVTT

01:23.041 --> 01:25.752
-Pick up, Jade.
-<i>Don't leave a message.</i>

01:58.451 --> 01:59.828
Yo, she's looking for you.

02:01.246 --> 02:04.207
-No.
-Yeah. She said no to no.

02:04.958 --> 02:08.378
-It's after midnight.
-It's not a request.

02:25.228 --> 02:27.188
-What's all this?
-Merch.

02:28.064 --> 02:29.732
She loves her merch.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.526
<i>So why did you go?</i>

02:32.152 --> 02:34.279
<i>It was just a party, Mom.</i>

02:34.362 --> 02:37.323
And you knew you could
take advantage of your mother.

02:37.407 --> 02:39.284
Please, you always just do what you want.

02:39.367 --> 02:40.285
You're grounded.

02:41.369 --> 02:42.745
<i>-Whatever.</i>
-Hey…

02:48.376 --> 02:49.377
You're late.

03:01.431 --> 03:04.392
-Evelyn, what's going on?
-Do you know this man?

03:04.475 --> 03:07.353
-Why would I?
-Because he knows about us.

03:08.021 --> 03:11.858
-Tijuana.
-You said Tijuana wouldn't be an issue.

03:11.941 --> 03:13.401
And I can admit it when I'm wrong.

03:14.444 --> 03:19.073
His name is Angel Hernan Rubio,
and he's been a pain in our ass for years.

03:19.824 --> 03:23.077
He worked for the <i>Baja Post</i>
until he heard something happened

03:23.161 --> 03:27.665
at our Mexican facility
and decided to go public.

03:28.708 --> 03:31.002
-Why didn't you just buy him?
-Oh, we tried.

03:31.920 --> 03:36.424
Not for sale, he's a very stand-up guy.

03:36.507 --> 03:39.552
So we bought everyone else,
and kept him under wraps.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.972
The only people who believed him
were conspiracy freaks

03:43.056 --> 03:45.516
and 4chan virgins, or both.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.644
Usually, it's both.

03:47.727 --> 03:51.689
Somehow, Mr. Rubio knows
we moved Joy to South Africa.

03:51.773 --> 03:54.901
And somehow, he knows we've had a problem.

03:56.861 --> 03:58.238
What kind of problem?

03:58.321 --> 04:00.990
The "dog" kind.

04:02.492 --> 04:07.247
I wanna know what he knows,
and I wanna know who he's talking to.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.666
-That's why you beat the shit out of him?
-No.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.168
That's why Roth beat the shit out of him.

04:12.252 --> 04:15.546
And as much as I appreciate
the goon work, it hasn't gotten us much.

04:17.548 --> 04:22.553
So it's time for old Albert
to come out and play.

04:26.975 --> 04:27.892
Hmm?

04:34.524 --> 04:36.025
The girls still up?

04:40.280 --> 04:42.865
-I have to go.
-Then you better work fast.

04:47.453 --> 04:50.915
Evelyn, I mean it.
I have to go right now.

05:19.402 --> 05:20.528
I know you.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.281
You're supposed to be dead.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.243
I…

05:31.664 --> 05:32.957
I…

05:35.251 --> 05:38.254
I know your daughters.

05:42.508 --> 05:44.177
There he is!

05:50.975 --> 05:51.934
No.

05:52.018 --> 05:55.646
-No, please. Please, no! Please, no! No!

05:57.982 --> 06:00.109
I've been looking up
OG Raccoon City

06:00.193 --> 06:02.153
and nothing says it got nuked.

06:02.820 --> 06:04.280
Because that guy was lying.

06:08.326 --> 06:10.536
'Cause I'm fine.

06:13.831 --> 06:18.294
And let's just be happy for like a second.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.379
Okay?

06:21.005 --> 06:22.131
I'm happy.

06:22.757 --> 06:25.343
Good. I'm getting ice cream.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.312
Dad never talks about them.

06:38.147 --> 06:39.816
The moms.

06:39.899 --> 06:44.695
You know, the donors,
<i>Rick and Morty</i>, our surrogate.

06:45.696 --> 06:48.950
It was a closed surrogacy,
closed donations.

06:51.285 --> 06:53.913
Dad never talks about his family.

06:53.996 --> 06:58.084
Brothers? Sisters? Parents?

06:58.167 --> 06:59.460
Where was he even born?

06:59.544 --> 07:00.586
Hey, stop.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.173
That guy was insane.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.299
Okay?

07:12.849 --> 07:14.058
What?

07:16.144 --> 07:19.647
When we went to Umbrella,
I found a file on Dad's computer…

07:24.110 --> 07:25.945
about Tijuana.

07:29.824 --> 07:31.117
What did it say?

07:32.368 --> 07:34.871
It didn't. It was a video.

07:35.663 --> 07:36.747
It looked like…

07:38.291 --> 07:39.625
people died.

07:42.211 --> 07:46.007
-Why didn't you tell me?
-I just… I, I don't know.

07:46.090 --> 07:48.426
Everything was fucked, and you were--

07:48.509 --> 07:50.303
That doesn't mean he's telling the truth.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.639
I know that, but… Okay.

07:53.723 --> 07:56.642
He said we didn't have
birth certificates, right?

07:59.812 --> 08:03.774
-So… let's find our birth certificates.
-Jade.

08:03.858 --> 08:07.528
Just, please be with me on this.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.363
Okay?

08:12.492 --> 08:14.619
And when we find them,
you'll chill and eat ice cream?

08:19.290 --> 08:22.335
I will eat all of the ice cream.

08:27.256 --> 08:28.216
Deal.

08:28.299 --> 08:29.300
Yes.

08:41.687 --> 08:42.688
See anything?

08:43.439 --> 08:47.777
<i>"Sherlock Holmes.</i>
Agatha Christie. <i>The Da Vinci Code."</i>

08:48.611 --> 08:49.862
Oh, my God.

08:50.988 --> 08:52.031
What?

08:55.117 --> 08:57.912
<i>"Dating Past Your Prime.</i>
<i>A Guide for Mature Lovers."</i>

09:02.124 --> 09:03.292
Ew.

09:22.353 --> 09:24.730
-Oh, shit.
-What?

09:25.439 --> 09:29.527
I found a dog whistle,
and this is for a gun?

09:33.573 --> 09:35.116
But Dad hates guns.

09:42.999 --> 09:43.958
Wait.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.922
-Jade.
-What's this?

09:50.006 --> 09:53.342
-Come on.

10:09.358 --> 10:11.110
He's using a different password.

10:11.944 --> 10:13.362
Cool.

10:13.446 --> 10:14.864
Are we done?

10:22.371 --> 10:24.040
This is so stupid.

10:24.707 --> 10:26.917
What are you
even going to tell Si…

10:27.001 --> 10:29.503
<i>-Jade. Hi, are you all right?</i>
-I'm…

10:30.338 --> 10:31.380
Why?

10:31.464 --> 10:34.467
<i>Some old guy crashed the party,</i>
<i>and then Umbrella security rolled in.</i>

10:34.550 --> 10:36.344
<i>-It was crazy.</i>
-So crazy.

10:36.427 --> 10:38.220
Hey, can you come over?

10:38.304 --> 10:40.264
<i>Jade, it's, like,</i>
<i>one o'clock in the morning.</i>

10:40.348 --> 10:41.682
<i>And my mother, she's super pissed.</i>

10:41.766 --> 10:43.059
<i>She nearly murdered me</i>
<i>for walking in so late.</i>

10:43.142 --> 10:44.352
<i>I, I doubt she'll let me leave.</i>

10:44.435 --> 10:46.896
-So go through the window.
-<i>Well, what's in it for me?</i>

10:46.979 --> 10:48.064
Gross.

10:51.108 --> 10:52.068
<i>Hi, Billie.</i>

10:53.486 --> 10:56.405
-I need to hack my dad's laptop.
<i>-Why?</i>

10:56.489 --> 10:58.282
What do you know
about the first Raccoon City?

11:01.494 --> 11:04.830
<i>Um, it, it… it blew up.</i>
<i>It was some sort of gas leak.</i>

11:04.914 --> 11:07.458
Yeah, well, the blog guy,
the one you helped me talk to,

11:07.541 --> 11:09.085
he said it got nuked.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.754
-<i>Fuck off.</i>
-And he said my dad was there.

11:11.837 --> 11:13.839
<i>Dude, it sounds mental.</i>

11:13.923 --> 11:16.050
This is Umbrella
like they wouldn't nuke people?

11:16.133 --> 11:17.718
<i>I mean, no.</i>

11:18.719 --> 11:19.929
<i>I don't know.</i>

11:20.763 --> 11:23.724
But you wanna know and you wanna help me.

11:24.558 --> 11:27.019
Hi. I'm still here.

11:27.103 --> 11:28.312
I'm still gagging.

11:29.021 --> 11:31.399
-Look, he's not going to help us.
-<i>Wait. Just wait.</i>

11:31.482 --> 11:32.817
<i>I…</i>

11:32.900 --> 11:34.819
<i>Okay, fine, but you owe me.</i>

11:35.403 --> 11:36.362
Always.

11:39.365 --> 11:40.658
All right.

11:44.495 --> 11:45.621
Damn.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.833
<i>I've never seen security like this</i>
<i>in Umbrella's networks.</i>

11:48.916 --> 11:50.126
<i>Hold, please.</i>

11:51.293 --> 11:53.629
<i>All right, you can fire up the laptop.</i>

11:56.382 --> 11:58.801
<i>-So where's your dad now?</i>
-Work.

11:58.884 --> 12:02.179
-<i>Yeah, my mom's working late too.</i>
-I thought you said she was home.

12:02.263 --> 12:05.474
<i>Uh, no, other mom. Two moms.</i>

12:06.308 --> 12:08.769
<i>That's why I'm so smooth with the ladies.</i>

12:13.023 --> 12:15.109
<i>All right, I'm in.</i>

12:16.819 --> 12:17.903
He's got it.

12:19.572 --> 12:22.199
<i>Nothing about</i>
<i>the original Raccoon City in his docs.</i>

12:23.242 --> 12:25.119
<i>It's mostly just research articles.</i>

12:25.202 --> 12:27.747
<i>A lot of stuff by some guy</i>
<i>named William Birkin.</i>

12:27.830 --> 12:32.668
<i>I mean, web-wise, he's got MSNBC</i>
<i>and Science Daily bookmarked.</i>

12:32.752 --> 12:35.087
<i>And the rest of it</i>
<i>is just old people shit,</i>

12:35.171 --> 12:37.840
<i>like credit cards, banks, car insurance.</i>

12:39.341 --> 12:40.718
What about his mail?

12:41.343 --> 12:44.180
<i>Mostly work. A lot of stuff to my mom.</i>

12:47.433 --> 12:48.642
Shit.

12:51.687 --> 12:53.355
He's got a dead drop e-mail.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.108
-A what?
-<i>A dead drop. It's…</i>

12:56.192 --> 12:59.403
<i>It's like you have to input a code</i>
<i>every 24 hours otherwise it sends.</i>

12:59.487 --> 13:02.573
-To who?
<i>-To you, Billie.</i>

13:05.367 --> 13:06.243
Me?

13:09.789 --> 13:11.207
What does it say?

13:15.586 --> 13:19.298
"Billie, if you're reading this,
I'm sorry.

13:20.424 --> 13:22.551
Something's happened to me,
and I can't help you,

13:22.635 --> 13:24.553
and you may not have much time.

13:26.305 --> 13:27.807
Umbrella is coming for you.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.936
I've left a bag
with everything you'll need.

13:32.019 --> 13:34.897
Find it, get Jade,
and get out of the house.

13:34.980 --> 13:37.566
I'm sorry, but this is
all I can do for you."

13:37.650 --> 13:39.109
This is, this is a joke.

13:39.193 --> 13:42.404
"To start, the key is buried
beneath your feet

13:42.488 --> 13:44.490
on the road to Lombard Street."

13:44.573 --> 13:45.991
<i>What?</i>

13:48.994 --> 13:50.788
We're finding that bag.

13:51.664 --> 13:52.748
Jade.

13:54.792 --> 13:57.545
Come on, that's not normal. That's…

13:58.796 --> 14:00.297
I don't know what this is.

14:01.340 --> 14:02.591
Thanks, bye.

14:02.675 --> 14:06.345
<i>Wait, wait. I can…</i>
<i>Um, I can help. The cameras.</i>

14:06.428 --> 14:08.013
-What cameras?
-<i>In your house.</i>

14:08.764 --> 14:10.266
<i>The security system.</i>

14:10.349 --> 14:12.643
<i>Look, your dad, or whoever,</i>
<i>could be watching.</i>

14:15.479 --> 14:17.731
<i>I… I can, I can loop them,</i>

14:17.815 --> 14:21.652
<i>the footage, so it just makes</i>
<i>you look, whatever, boring.</i>

14:22.403 --> 14:25.406
-Is that legal?
<i>-Well, after that, do you really care?</i>

14:36.166 --> 14:37.418
<i>All right, it's done.</i>

14:37.501 --> 14:39.753
<i>It's going to loop</i>
<i>what was happening a half an hour ago.</i>

14:40.629 --> 14:43.173
<i>Second problem,</i>
<i>every smart appliance in your house,</i>

14:43.257 --> 14:44.550
<i>there's a camera in it.</i>

14:46.594 --> 14:50.014
-Loop those too, then.
<i>-No, I can't. They are on a closed system.</i>

14:50.097 --> 14:53.017
<i>Only the cops and maybe</i>
<i>your dad have access.</i>

14:53.100 --> 14:54.351
So we're screwed.

14:54.435 --> 14:57.438
<i>No, not entirely.</i>
<i>They all have a limited field of view.</i>

14:58.522 --> 14:59.523
<i>Here.</i>

15:04.111 --> 15:06.363
<i>-I can talk you past them.</i>
-Cool.

15:07.239 --> 15:08.741
Why are you doing this?

15:08.824 --> 15:10.743
I mean yeah, she's hot,
but she's not felony hot.

15:10.826 --> 15:12.786
Whoa, I kinda am. That's offensive.

15:12.870 --> 15:15.164
-Okay.
-<i>No, it's not about that.</i>

15:15.247 --> 15:18.000
<i>Look, for one, this is just too weird.</i>

15:18.083 --> 15:21.879
<i>But I want to know why your dad thinks</i>
<i>Umbrella would go after him.</i>

15:21.962 --> 15:23.297
Because…

15:23.380 --> 15:26.008
<i>Because they could go after my mom too.</i>

15:33.933 --> 15:35.059
Fine.

15:35.851 --> 15:37.561
<i>Where are you going?</i>

15:37.645 --> 15:38.771
Lombard Street.

15:44.944 --> 15:45.945
<i>Stop.</i>

15:46.779 --> 15:48.072
<i>The thermostat.</i>

15:50.449 --> 15:51.533
<i>Uh, go under it.</i>

15:56.163 --> 15:57.206
<i>Keep low.</i>

15:58.791 --> 15:59.792
<i>Lower.</i>

16:02.086 --> 16:04.797
<i>-Lower.</i>
-Seriously?

16:06.048 --> 16:07.675
<i>Well, you've got</i>
<i>the TV on one side</i>

16:07.758 --> 16:09.802
<i>and the fridge on the other, so yes.</i>

16:17.977 --> 16:19.770
<i>All right. You're clear.</i>

16:24.650 --> 16:25.818
Lombard Street.

16:26.527 --> 16:29.196
Dad always said
this was his favorite picture of us.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.408
<i>Yeah, hold me up.</i>

16:48.924 --> 16:52.261
"The key
to a sad Jade in the 5th grade."

17:01.478 --> 17:03.063
Why is he doing this?

17:05.190 --> 17:07.818
Because this is the stuff
only we can figure out.

17:13.407 --> 17:17.036
-I mean, you. He wrote you.
-Just…

17:17.119 --> 17:19.413
Jade, what were you sad about?

17:26.628 --> 17:27.755
When I was 11.

17:31.175 --> 17:32.760
I mean, life,

17:32.843 --> 17:35.596
<i>Clannad,</i> the fact that the world is shit
and I'm living in it.

17:35.679 --> 17:37.056
-I…

17:37.848 --> 17:39.683
I was a really dark kid, okay?

17:39.767 --> 17:40.768
Jade.

17:43.520 --> 17:44.521
Come on.

17:45.481 --> 17:48.942
I don't know. I… I got my tonsils out.

17:49.985 --> 17:54.073
And the doctor said I had to sleep,
but it hurt so much.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.991
I was just crying.

17:56.950 --> 17:58.952
Dad never knows
what to do when we cry.

17:59.036 --> 18:01.455
So to put me to sleep, he kept playing…

18:04.750 --> 18:05.959
Oh!

18:08.128 --> 18:09.171
<i>Television.</i>

18:19.848 --> 18:22.601
<i>You know, I'm probably</i>
<i>not supposed to say it, but…</i>

18:23.268 --> 18:24.603
this is kinda cool.

18:24.686 --> 18:27.189
It's traumatic, but it's cool.

18:27.272 --> 18:29.066
You just like spending time with me.

18:29.149 --> 18:31.360
I like that you keep
needing me for things.

18:31.443 --> 18:32.694
Loser.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.877
The song. The one Dad always played.

19:47.728 --> 19:49.396
"Moving song, huh?"

20:06.830 --> 20:07.956
It's hollow.

20:20.677 --> 20:21.803
What's there?

20:43.200 --> 20:44.618
Passports.

20:45.953 --> 20:46.954
For…

20:47.537 --> 20:51.208
"Anna and Mila Schneider," but…

20:52.376 --> 20:54.419
it's our pictures.

20:55.712 --> 20:56.797
I, I don't…

20:59.591 --> 21:01.051
Cash.

21:01.802 --> 21:04.638
-Like, ten grand.

21:04.721 --> 21:05.722
<i>Shit.</i>

21:17.693 --> 21:19.027
Found his gun.

21:22.281 --> 21:25.450
<i>Shit. You know, your dad</i>
<i>for sure nuked that town.</i>

21:25.534 --> 21:27.035
Shut up.

21:29.162 --> 21:30.747
That's your problem.

21:31.415 --> 21:34.876
All of this, and that is your problem?

21:34.960 --> 21:36.253
No, you don't…

21:39.423 --> 21:41.717
<i>I…</i>

21:49.641 --> 21:50.892
I didn't want to do this.

21:53.061 --> 21:55.981
I was fine, and everything was fine.

21:56.064 --> 21:57.816
Nothing was ever fine.

21:58.608 --> 22:01.987
You know, the guy was right.

22:02.070 --> 22:03.280
No, he wasn't right.

22:03.989 --> 22:06.283
-You don't even--
-He wasn't right about me!

22:24.926 --> 22:26.803
Dad has been lying to us.

22:27.596 --> 22:30.432
I don't know how. I don't know why.

22:30.515 --> 22:33.727
-But he is obviously crazy.
-Dad's not…

22:33.810 --> 22:35.520
He cares about us.

22:36.271 --> 22:39.358
-I mean, he left us a note.
-He left <i>you</i> that note!

22:42.944 --> 22:43.945
Whatever.

22:45.072 --> 22:49.826
Maybe… maybe he knew
you wouldn't ask questions.

23:00.295 --> 23:02.798
You are super fucking mean
sometimes, you know that?

23:02.881 --> 23:03.757
Billie…

23:03.840 --> 23:05.509
I just thought I was dying.

23:05.592 --> 23:06.802
And did you care?

23:06.885 --> 23:08.136
That's not what this is about--

23:08.220 --> 23:12.849
Because it wasn't about you.
Like, like it has been our whole lives.

23:14.476 --> 23:19.523
Or maybe Dad trusts me
because he knows I'm not the fuckup.

23:19.606 --> 23:23.110
I mean, you whine about everything
all the time, and you're barely passing.

23:23.193 --> 23:26.613
-You took a rock to that girl--
-I did that for you!

23:28.740 --> 23:30.075
Now who's lying?

23:30.909 --> 23:33.662
You did that
because you wanted to.

23:34.287 --> 23:36.331
Everyone thinks I'm the psycho.

23:40.335 --> 23:41.628
But you were worse.

24:00.689 --> 24:01.690
<i>Hey?</i>

24:06.695 --> 24:08.196
<i>Sisters, huh?</i>

24:19.499 --> 24:23.044
-How much did you hear?
-<i>No, I… Nothing, Billie. I, um…</i>

24:26.006 --> 24:29.217
<i>Look, I… It's insane.</i>
<i>It's completely insane.</i>

24:30.510 --> 24:32.721
<i>You know, I barely even know you, but I…</i>

24:34.723 --> 24:36.766
<i>I just really like your sister.</i>

24:36.850 --> 24:38.393
Oh, you like that she's using you?

24:39.186 --> 24:44.316
-Because… she's kind of using you.
-<i>Maybe. Maybe, but…</i>

24:44.399 --> 24:48.403
<i>No, I like that when she cares,</i>
<i>she goes super hard, you know?</i>

24:49.613 --> 24:52.574
<i>And she must really care for you</i>
<i>since you're all she ever talks about.</i>

24:54.242 --> 24:55.243
Yeah.

24:58.872 --> 25:00.248
Right.

25:11.676 --> 25:13.595
I'm gonna
put you back on mute now.

25:24.481 --> 25:25.524
I'm sorry.

25:29.069 --> 25:30.403
I'm just scared.

25:32.531 --> 25:33.573
Me too.

25:36.159 --> 25:39.538
If Dad is hiding this,
what else is he hiding?

25:44.501 --> 25:45.961
What's he hiding about us?

25:47.963 --> 25:49.548
Do you really wanna know?

25:50.215 --> 25:51.174
I do.

26:03.520 --> 26:04.729
Me too.

26:32.924 --> 26:35.969
Okay, if I wanted
to stash something in this house,

26:36.052 --> 26:39.347
let's say, hmm, important papers,
where would I put them?

26:39.431 --> 26:42.183
<i>Um, maybe in the basement?</i>

26:42.267 --> 26:45.145
-We don't have a basement.
-<i>Yes, you do.</i>

26:45.228 --> 26:47.981
<i>When Umbrella is prefabbing your house,</i>
<i>they only give you two options,</i>

26:48.064 --> 26:50.692
<i>they give you patio and jacuzzi,</i>
<i>or pool and herb garden.</i>

26:50.775 --> 26:53.361
<i>But no, they, they all have basements.</i>

26:56.239 --> 26:57.324
<i>There's a camera!</i>

27:02.454 --> 27:03.663
Goddamn it!

27:10.045 --> 27:11.379
<i>Weird.</i>

27:11.463 --> 27:13.048
<i>That's usually the basement.</i>

27:13.798 --> 27:15.634
<i>-You're clear of the camera.</i>

27:37.364 --> 27:38.490
Jade.

27:52.921 --> 27:54.923
I think that's an RFID reader.

27:55.006 --> 27:57.926
<i>It's like, you know when you need</i>
<i>to beep into a garage or something.</i>

27:58.510 --> 28:00.804
<i>You normally need a special card,</i>

28:00.887 --> 28:04.057
or some people get chips implanted
in their hands.

28:10.980 --> 28:13.483
-What are you doing?
-Come here.

28:14.234 --> 28:15.276
-Dude.
-Here.

28:17.153 --> 28:19.447
Just try… Put your hands.

28:19.531 --> 28:20.782
-Jade.
-Maybe if you try it this way?

28:20.865 --> 28:22.242
-Let me just--
-Get off me.

28:26.913 --> 28:28.957
Dad's probably got the key with him.

28:30.083 --> 28:32.794
<i>Yeah, but everybody's got a spare, right?</i>

28:37.966 --> 28:39.634
The dog whistle.

28:57.235 --> 28:59.821
You chipped fuzzy baby.

28:59.904 --> 29:02.449
You. Hey.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.838
<i>That was… cute.</i>

29:33.730 --> 29:35.356
You can go first.

29:48.244 --> 29:50.997
Umbrella must know about this.
I mean they built it, right?

29:52.999 --> 29:55.627
Please don't let this be
his mature sex dungeon.

29:57.462 --> 30:01.007
<i>Jade, I'm… I'm cutting off.</i>
<i>Jade, can you hear me?</i>

30:22.237 --> 30:23.863
Not a sex dungeon.

30:46.511 --> 30:47.887
This was mine.

30:49.389 --> 30:50.723
From when I was two.

31:15.999 --> 31:17.083
What's that?

31:19.294 --> 31:20.253
I don't know.

31:36.019 --> 31:37.395
Hey.

31:39.272 --> 31:41.107
I think that's our blood.

32:02.629 --> 32:05.632
That's… What the fuck?

32:13.556 --> 32:16.017
"RC 1998."

32:18.770 --> 32:19.938
Raccoon City.

32:37.664 --> 32:38.665
Who's Lisa?

33:03.940 --> 33:05.149
Dad?

33:06.484 --> 33:09.946
<i>If she tries anything,</i>
<i>shoot the bitch.</i>

33:10.029 --> 33:11.781
Dad's an asshole.

33:13.116 --> 33:14.200
<i>Lisa.</i>

33:16.244 --> 33:17.328
<i>Lisa.</i>

33:18.997 --> 33:21.290
<i>-Lisa, we're not going to hurt you.</i>

33:41.227 --> 33:42.395
We have to go.

33:42.478 --> 33:43.646
-Billie…
-I want to go!

33:43.730 --> 33:45.148
Hey, that wasn't real!

33:46.024 --> 33:49.068
It… it can't be real.

33:51.070 --> 33:52.572
-No, Jade--
-Wait.

33:54.365 --> 33:58.494
-I'm leaving.
-"September 18th, 12 hours in,

33:59.162 --> 34:01.789
her body shows limited reaction to virus.

34:01.873 --> 34:05.001
Twenty-four hours in, viral count is up.

34:05.084 --> 34:10.048
No pupil dilation, but the subject
is withdrawn, abnormal."

34:11.466 --> 34:13.426
He's talking about me.

34:16.929 --> 34:19.932
"The virus doesn't seem
to be overwhelming her cells.

34:21.225 --> 34:27.565
But deterioration is expected
on the standard 72-hour clock.

34:27.648 --> 34:29.776
If she does turn, she'll…"

34:30.526 --> 34:31.778
What?

34:37.492 --> 34:39.368
"She'll need to be contained."

34:54.634 --> 34:56.427
You're right. Let's go.

35:03.267 --> 35:05.520
-No, what are you doing?
-Taking…

35:06.521 --> 35:07.730
This is proof.

35:10.566 --> 35:13.402
<i>Network connection</i>
<i>improperly severed.</i>

35:13.486 --> 35:15.279
<i>-Burn sequence initiated.</i>
-Shit.

35:15.363 --> 35:16.489
<i>Thirty seconds.</i>

35:18.825 --> 35:20.451
<i>Twenty-five seconds.</i>

35:21.244 --> 35:22.870
Go, go! Come on!

35:22.954 --> 35:24.330
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

35:26.582 --> 35:27.583
<i>Fifteen seconds.</i>

35:27.667 --> 35:30.002
-No, it's locked!
-It won't open!

35:30.086 --> 35:31.337
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

35:31.420 --> 35:36.843
<i>Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four,</i>

35:36.926 --> 35:40.012
<i>three, two, one.</i>

35:40.096 --> 35:41.556
<i>Burn sequence activated.</i>

36:00.658 --> 36:02.076
Oh, my God!

37:03.304 --> 37:05.097
What are you doing here?

37:05.848 --> 37:08.059
Well, how did you
even get down here?

37:08.142 --> 37:10.728
You mean how did we find your secret lab?

37:10.811 --> 37:12.355
You know what I do.

37:12.438 --> 37:17.485
Some girl with a giant eyeball
on her back, that's what you do?

37:21.739 --> 37:25.076
-That wasn't me.
-Sounded like you.

37:25.159 --> 37:28.120
-Jade, I'm telling you the truth.
-Why, why should we believe you?

37:28.204 --> 37:31.540
-Because I'm your father.
-Are you?

37:31.624 --> 37:33.793
Where were we born? What hospital?

37:33.876 --> 37:35.920
What were our donor's names?

37:36.003 --> 37:41.926
San Francisco, UCSF Med.
Tara Sutton and Alex Shaum.

37:43.010 --> 37:44.011
Don't.

37:46.389 --> 37:48.057
I found the email.

37:49.141 --> 37:51.185
And the shitty clues, the bag.

37:51.269 --> 37:54.689
Why do you have our blood
in your mini-fridge?

38:02.738 --> 38:03.698
Billie.

38:03.781 --> 38:05.533
What's wrong with me?

38:05.616 --> 38:06.867
We can talk about that, upstairs.

38:06.951 --> 38:08.244
Fuck you.

38:09.078 --> 38:11.372
-Jade.
-Stop.

38:12.790 --> 38:14.375
-I said stop!

38:16.210 --> 38:17.253
No.

38:20.589 --> 38:22.925
I am not playing this game.

38:24.885 --> 38:27.930
I am your fucking father,
and you'll do as you're fucking told!

39:04.467 --> 39:05.509
That chair…

39:06.385 --> 39:07.803
It was for me, right?

39:14.769 --> 39:17.938
The dog that bit you, it was sick.

39:18.856 --> 39:21.942
Umbrella was testing
a drug called Joy. It was…

39:22.026 --> 39:24.820
It doesn't matter. Look, it…

39:24.904 --> 39:28.491
At high enough doses, it infects the body
with something called the T-virus.

39:28.574 --> 39:32.244
And what, that's like… Covid?

39:33.120 --> 39:36.415
It changes your cells,
takes over your body.

39:36.499 --> 39:37.541
It can make you…

39:40.503 --> 39:41.879
inhuman.

39:54.058 --> 39:57.311
That girl in the video.
That's what she had?

39:57.395 --> 39:58.687
But you're not…

39:59.480 --> 40:01.273
You fought the virus off.

40:01.357 --> 40:03.567
I don't know how, but, you…
I mean, look at you.

40:04.485 --> 40:07.113
-You haven't changed.
-So what?

40:07.196 --> 40:08.155
It's gone?

40:09.657 --> 40:11.409
-This thing?
-I don't know.

40:13.035 --> 40:15.121
-I could run some tests.
-No tests.

40:17.706 --> 40:20.209
Billie, Billie, remember
like we used to do?

40:20.292 --> 40:22.545
Breathe, hands on your head.

40:24.630 --> 40:25.673
That's right.

40:29.135 --> 40:30.261
Billie.

40:30.928 --> 40:32.388
You're strong.

40:36.767 --> 40:38.227
What does that mean?

40:38.310 --> 40:42.314
It means… I made you strong.

40:47.403 --> 40:50.990
In an embryo,
there are ways you can… help.

40:51.657 --> 40:54.743
Select for certain traits,
edit strands of DNA to give the child…

40:55.703 --> 40:56.745
advantages.

40:56.829 --> 40:59.790
Remember when we lived by St. Patrick's?

40:59.874 --> 41:02.793
I found you outside one day talking
to the nuns in fluent Spanish.

41:02.877 --> 41:04.086
You were four.

41:04.795 --> 41:06.881
You've always been exceptional.

41:06.964 --> 41:09.049
And your body,
how you fought off the virus,

41:09.133 --> 41:10.718
I've never seen anything like it.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.013
So what?

41:14.889 --> 41:17.016
We're like your science experiments?

41:18.100 --> 41:20.769
You're my daughters. I'm your father.

41:21.520 --> 41:24.190
Then why are you taking our blood?

41:29.528 --> 41:35.451
Umbrella… made you possible.
They, they want me to monitor you.

41:37.495 --> 41:39.330
So we're their experiments.

41:41.790 --> 41:44.793
Do you know a man named Angel Rubio?

41:48.172 --> 41:51.509
Right now, Umbrella
has him tied up, beaten.

41:52.009 --> 41:55.179
That's where I was. He said he knew you.

41:55.262 --> 41:57.181
Did you see him? Talk to him?

41:59.808 --> 42:01.852
Well, you don't know
what Umbrella will do if--

42:01.936 --> 42:04.271
Fucking stop blaming them!

42:04.939 --> 42:09.026
This is you! You did this!

42:12.738 --> 42:16.450
You're right, but I still need to know.

42:24.208 --> 42:28.212
We didn't tell him anything,
but he knows I got bit.

42:32.174 --> 42:35.177
Well, you need to let me go.
Look, this is my fault.

42:35.261 --> 42:37.763
But if the company finds out
you were infected?

42:37.846 --> 42:40.057
They won't stop
until they have you.

42:40.140 --> 42:41.934
That girl in the video,
you saw what they did to her.

42:42.017 --> 42:43.269
What <i>you</i> did to her.

42:45.646 --> 42:48.315
I'm the reason you're still alive.

42:48.399 --> 42:51.110
The bag,
it's all to keep you safe.

42:51.193 --> 42:53.362
Angel hasn't told them
anything yet, but he will.

42:53.445 --> 42:55.906
-I need to get to him.
-And do what?

42:57.908 --> 42:59.285
Keep protecting you.

43:11.255 --> 43:14.550
-This is bullshit.
-I know you hate me.

43:15.759 --> 43:16.885
And right now…

43:19.013 --> 43:20.973
I'm the only one who can save you.

43:25.269 --> 43:26.937
So let me save you.

43:47.082 --> 43:48.584
You're not going to hurt him, right?

43:50.836 --> 43:52.254
Stay safe.

44:08.812 --> 44:10.397
No!

44:33.754 --> 44:34.922
Hi, sis.

44:38.008 --> 44:39.009
No.
